The Spirit of Negotiation
——Speech at the World Peace Council Budapest Meeting
Soviet Union Ailunbao

    We are gathered together in extraordinary days: reports in the newspapers about burning cities and maimed children, the destruction of peace-loving countries, the humiliation that troubles the sleep of mankind, in short, the nightmare of Korea is about to end. The war that threatened to expand and engulf other countries and continents is coming to an end. This is the first great victory for peace, our victory, friends!
    Now everyone sees that negotiations can lead to agreements. Now everyone understands that if the bloody Korean War can be ended, then another war—less earth-shattering, but threatening the people of the world and abhorred by all honest people, the Cold War—can also be ended. The spirit of negotiation has clearly gained the upper hand over the policy of war, and this is also a great victory for the peace advocates.
    Let us recall the situation when our movement began not long ago. How lonely we were portrayed then! We remember the ridicule, slander, threats, and persecution. In April 1949, we condemned the Cold War and advocated negotiations between the major powers. In April 1953, President Eisenhower said the same. In Warsaw, we demanded the cessation of those wars in Asia and the participation of China in the United Nations. As far as I remember, Attlee did not express any sympathy for the Warsaw Congress. But now, he has expressed support for the peace advocates' proposals to end the wars in Asia and to promptly allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations General Assembly. At the World People's Congress for the Defense of Peace, we declared that the sovereignty of countries is inseparable from their security. Now, ministers of Scandinavian countries, Mendès-France, and the British Prime Minister are saying the same. We have come a long way and accomplished great things, and this is worth repeating here at the meeting of the World Peace Council, which is watched by all who hate war.
    Now some political activists accept some of the suggestions we made in Paris, Warsaw, and Vienna for one reason or another, and some accept them with certain riders. I am certainly not prepared to include these people among the peace advocates, but such remarks are worth noting: they are being forced by the will of the people. "U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "The question is, how long can the governments and politicians of Western European countries resist the pressure of the people who are inclined towards peace and hope to end the Cold War?" This American magazine goes on to say that those politicians who run counter to public opinion inclined towards peace cannot maintain their power for long. In my opinion, the editor-in-chief of "U.S. News & World Report" is wrong on this point: the people's desire for peace has not only begun to influence the actions of many politicians in Western Europe, but has also caused echoes in other parts of the world—countries under the British Empire, republics in Latin America, and even within the United States. As for us peace advocates, we will not claim copyright on the peace program, nor will we blame people for thinking of the need for consultation after so long. We are prepared to support any proposal from any politician in any country, as long as the proposal is sincerely intended to ease international tensions and find a path to glorious agreement.
    At the same time, let us not be intoxicated by the initial victories of peace, intoxicated by celebrations, congratulations, and applause. The forces of war do not feel that they have been defeated at all, and the Korean agreement is only their first major setback. They have not given up and hope to recoup their losses elsewhere. These dark forces have kept mankind in a state of panic for many years, and it is naive to think that they will easily abandon their goals; some of them are dominated by insatiable greed, others suffer from paranoid delusions of terror, and still others crave the power to rule—all of these are not easy ailments to cure. It is very useful to take a look at the market column of American newspapers in the days before the Korean agreement was reached. On June 1st, stocks on the New York market fell sharply; on June 4th, they fell even more sharply. The stocks of DuPont and Chrysler, "General Electric," and "Aluminum Company" were among those that fell; the stocks of the aviation industry fell particularly sharply. Finally, on June 9th, there was a new and more violent slump. "The Wall Street Journal" wrote: "Some people have already started talking about the dangers of peace."
    If some people hate agreements because of insatiable greed, then other war-supporting guys are blinded by fanatical beliefs, blind hatred of progress, and fear of the future. We see how stubbornly the rulers of Seoul are eager to continue the bloodshed in Korea. If the Korean armistice frightens Syngman Rhee, then the idea of a peaceful negotiation between the major powers to resolve the German question will make Adenauer restless. Not long ago, a report from Bonn issued by "German News Agency" said: "Since the Western powers may hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question in the near future, the Federal Government intends to formally request the Western powers not to have any contact with the East." Finally, the forces of war are still exerting pressure, trying to influence the policies of some countries. Labor Party leader Attlee said in his speech—a speech that was very popular with Conservative Party members:
    "The fact that some people in the United States are unwilling to make a peaceful adjustment should be noted. Some people are determined to expand the war to China and simply have an anti-communist war." American female journalist Dorothy Thompson wrote in "The Washington Star": "It is said that all Americans, without exception, hope for peace. But 'peace' under the current conditions can only be this: it is obtained through negotiation rather than forced acceptance. General Van Fleet does not want such peace, and Senator McCarthy does not like it either. On the contrary, this senator clearly hopes to not only expand the war to China, but also involve Britain—sink British ships, in other words, declare war on the whole world." Needless to say, I don't want to exaggerate, nor am I worried about the fate of British ships, but it would be naive to close our eyes to the desperate struggles of those who want war—cold and hot. We should work tirelessly to make everyone understand the truth. We should make our best efforts to make the voices of millions of people sound louder, reaching the ears of those who are unwilling to listen, and we should strive to make all governments value the people's desire for peace, rather than the conspiracies of a small group of businessmen or politicians.
    We know that the road to peace is not easy. Only simple-minded people would imagine that mankind could wake up and look up to see a clear sky of complete agreement. However, the initial achievements of peace have already caused some changes. The spiritual shadows brought about by the Cold War created illusory obstacles and concealed the real traps. Now light is playing its role. Many questions have appeared before the people of all countries, first of all, questions related to the sovereignty of their countries. This question has been raised in various ways by many politicians who have adopted the demands of public opinion. Mendès-France said: "Spiritual unity and ideological unity should no longer be burdened by subordination, although everyone is interested in abolishing subordination... The ministers of European countries have all lined up to pay their respects to the new American government. Is this how Europe can be created?" These words are worth pondering. Churchill's speech also resounded loudly in a different tone. When discussing this speech, the American "Newsweek" said: "Sir Winston knows that it is very beneficial to show that he is not controlled by Washington on diplomatic issues..." In Buenos Aires, Rome, Copenhagen, and Rio de Janeiro, there are calls for the protection of sovereign independence everywhere. Here, I will quote a few sharp words from the normally cautious Conservative newspaper "Daily Express": "The United States is still talking about giving money to Britain, but Britain should now refuse these dollars. This will only make it stronger, not weaken it."
    Perhaps some skeptical people will say that we Soviets are too fond of emphasizing the discords between Western countries, thinking that this is the guarantee of peace. Of course, things are not like this. We hope that there will be peace between all peoples and all countries. We hope for peace—peace based on mutual respect and equality.
    I think everyone now understands how much the sovereignty of a country is threatened if it participates in a war group where everything is decided solely by the strongest or richest country. This threat is exacerbated by the presence of foreign military bases on the territories of many sovereign countries. Under these conditions, it is impossible for a sovereign country to have any certainty that it will not be involved in a war against its will. Take the so-called "European Federation," for example, the formation of this organization was not out of the wishes of the European people, but was forced upon them by representatives from another continent. Not long ago, a reporter from "The Times" who had been to Paris, Bonn, and the Benelux countries wrote: "Anyone who comes to the capital of a Western European country and talks to the leaders of various political parties will find it very strange to see that people have no enthusiastic expression for the plan to establish a European Defense Community." Mrs. Tabouis pointed out in "Inside News": "Opposition to the Paris Treaty has almost become a unanimous attitude in our country." British newspapers are full of opinions against dragging Britain into actions that are hostile to China, and I am not prepared to quote more here. These articles are not so much written because their self-esteem has been hurt, but rather because the authors have a lot of common sense. Although Britain has many great visionaries, it is good at thinking realistically, and it has seen the direct threat from several plots to undermine its sovereignty. In the recent elections, the Italian people showed their rejection of the policies of subservience, hostility, and war. Is it necessary to talk about the situation of some small countries? Not long ago, the Prime Minister of Denmark admitted: "Of course, no one is happy to have foreign troops stationed in our country." Radical Dalgaard declared: The arrival of American Air Force pilots in Denmark is a "direct threat to Denmark." "Stockholm Morning News" also said: "Warlike warlords trample on everything, regardless of the wishes of small countries, regardless of their love of freedom, not to mention grand promises... For example, if allied planes were stationed on the territory of Norway, would its position not be much worse now? Norway has taken a negative stance on this issue, it is showing a completely natural, and from a national point of view, very legitimate egoism."
    Yes, it is not only legitimate from a national point of view for sovereign countries to oppose foreign troops stationed on their territory and to oppose the establishment of various "supra-national armies" commanded by foreigners, but it is also legitimate from an international point of view. This question is not only related to this or that country, but to all countries, because subordination to a ruler, sometimes to the secret forces of a strong country's aggressive group, foreign military bases, and the establishment of "supra-national armies," etc., only make the danger of war more serious. We, the fighters for peace, warmly support all sincere proposals that advocate gradual universal disarmament under international supervision. But if anyone wants to arm the revanchists and establish new armies under the supervision of a staff of what is superficially an international institution but is actually a strong country, we will firmly oppose it to the end.
    Of course, the danger of war can only be finally eliminated when the major powers reach a complete agreement. Our goal is a peace pact. But the road to reaching this pact, as I have said, is neither short nor simple. The people of every country continue to be rightly concerned about their own security. Perhaps the movement of neutral people has not yet become a solid practical force in some countries, but there is a growing tendency to change diplomatic policies, strive to protect national sovereignty, prevent foreign countries from establishing military bases, refuse to participate in "European armies," and, in some countries, even hope to withdraw from military alliances forced upon them by foreign countries. Everyone should pay attention to these tendencies now. As peace advocates, we must support all measures aimed at guaranteeing national sovereignty and protecting their security, and we must support those strata of society that, although they have not fought with us in the struggle for world peace, are opposed to the forces of war.
    Sometimes, people ask the question of how a country can protect its own security if it refuses to participate in a war group. This is a strange question. Imagine that when people are talking about regulating automobile traffic on the streets and avoiding traffic accidents, drivers would retort: "That's fine, but my car tires may burst." Refusing to participate in aggressive pacts does not reduce, but rather increases a country's chances of security. We peace advocates have long fought for the rebirth of the United Nations, which, if it follows the principles set by its creators, can truly guarantee the security of all countries in the world. The spirit of agreement reached through consultation—a spirit that has already begun to squeeze out the policies of ultimatums, forced acceptance, and threats everywhere—must change the "climate of the United Nations" and restore its lost prestige. And to do this, it is necessary to allow China to obtain its rightful seat in the United Nations. British politicians understand this, and I hope that American leaders will also understand this. China's participation in the United Nations will help it play its role—the role of peace guarantor, because without China, it is impossible to resolve the disputes that have occurred in vast and complex Asia, because the first cordial handshake between American and Chinese representatives will not only reassure the Indians and Burmese, but will also reassure the Australians, British, and even Brazilians. Signing a peace treaty with a unified, peace-loving Germany will eliminate the danger of war in Europe. Germany must become a sovereign country, but its neighbors, and the people of all countries, should be guaranteed that the spirit of revanchism and aggressive forces will not be revived. Peace-loving Germany should not participate in any military groups or military alliances that are directed at the people of those countries that jointly defeated Nazi tyranny.
    In order to prevent the revival of aggressive forces, the Soviet Union has signed a series of treaties of friendship and mutual assistance. For example, the Franco-Soviet and Anglo-Soviet treaties are of this nature. Perhaps, after signing a series of different and sometimes contradictory documents in recent years, some politicians in the West have long forgotten the peace-loving treaties signed with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet people take the signatures that make their country responsible very seriously, and they still regard the several treaties I have mentioned as guarantees of European peace, of course, if both parties to the treaty abide by them.
    As for smaller countries, then, the United Nations restoring the spirit stated in its charter, plus the non-aggression pacts they may sign with neighboring countries, will of course better guarantee their security than participating in war groups—in those war groups, they actually have no say at all.
    I am saying that the true autonomy of a country is the guarantee of peace. Some people may ask me whether this also applies to the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for independence. Of course, no one will doubt that the Soviet people sympathize with the oppressed, not the oppressors. But I want to answer this question from the point of view of defending peace. Churchill and Attlee once laughed at several newspapers that asserted that Vietnam's struggle for its own independence was a Soviet conspiracy. I have no doubt that Churchill and Attlee also understand that the demands of the people of Malaya are completely reasonable. The various political tricks played by the forces of war that we have seen in the Laos incident show that using arms to oppose national liberation movements is very likely to create new hotbeds of war, creating a second Korea. It is precisely for this reason that we, the fighters for peace, advocate that all ethnic groups have the right to be independent and insist on resolving all existing conflicts through consultation.
    In the new situation that has emerged, in the situation where the tense international situation has undeniably eased, the question of the sovereignty and security of countries has taken on particular importance. We Soviets watch with understanding and deep sympathy the efforts of the people of all countries to protect their own security. We have always recognized that every nation has the right to independent survival and the right to freely choose a way of life that is more suitable for itself. It is impossible to create peace only with like-minded friends; it must be built together with people who have different ideas and are still full of doubts. Now we don't want to recall past accusations, attacks, and threats. We only hope to consult with those who do not love us warmly, deeply, and for a long time.
    Friends, the first stage has passed. We cannot stop halfway. After the Korean armistice, peace should follow. After the consultations in Korea, other consultations should follow: there are too many painful places in this world, there are too many problems. We should work harder for peace, so that none of us will feel ashamed and blush when we see the children in Budapest or London, Moscow or New York. In Vienna, when I said that every nation, whether large or small, has the right to control its own destiny, I thought of the French proverb, "The coal miners are masters in their own homes." Now I want to add a few words: coal miners are generally peaceful people, each of them has their own home, their own happiness, and their own worries, and I firmly believe that coal miners will certainly be able to discuss a result with each other.

### 协商精神——在世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议上的发言

    协商精神
    ——在世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议上的发言
    苏联  爱伦堡
    我们是在非常的日子中聚在一起的：报纸上关于燃烧中的城市和被残害的儿童的报道，酷爱和平的国家的破坏，人类为之寝食不安的耻辱，总之朝鲜的噩梦快要做完了。威胁着要扩大而把其他国家和其他各洲卷进去的战争快要结束了。这是和平的第一个大胜利，我们的胜利，朋友们！
    现在大家都看到谈判是能够获致协议的。现在大家都懂得，如果流血的朝鲜战争也可以结束，那么另一个战争——不那么震动人心，但使全世界人民深受威胁而为一切正直的人们所嫌恶的冷战也是可以结束的。协商精神明显地占了战争政策的上风，而这也是和平拥护者的一个巨大的胜利。
    让我们回顾一下不久以前我们的运动开始时的情形吧。那时候我们被描绘得多么孤单！我们记得嘲笑、诽谤、威胁、迫害。一九四九年四月，我们谴责冷战，主张各大国协商。一九五三年四月，艾森豪威尔总统也这么说了。在华沙，我们要求停止亚洲的那些战争、让中国参加联合国组织。就我所记得的说，艾德礼对华沙大会没有表示任何同情。但是现在，和平拥护者所提出的关于结束亚洲的战争、迅速让中华人民共和国的代表参加联合国大会的建议，他却表示拥护了。在世界人民保卫和平大会上，我们宣称，国家的主权是和它们的安全分不开的。现在斯堪的那维亚各国的部长、孟戴斯—弗朗斯以及英国的首相也这么说了。我们已经走过了很长的道路，完成了伟大的事业，而关于这一点，在这里，在凡是憎恨战争的人们都注意的世界和平理事会的会议上，也不妨再说一次。
    现在有些政治活动家是为了这一个或那一个原因才接受我们在巴黎、华沙、维也纳所提出的若干建议的，有的接受时还加了某种附带条件。这些人，我当然不预备归入和平拥护者之列，但这样的言论总值得注意：他们是为人民的意志逼出来的。“美国新闻与世界报道”写道：“问题在于，西欧各国的政府和政治家还能够和倾向和平希望结束冷战的人民的压力对抗多久。”这个美国杂志接下去说，和倾向和平的社会舆论背道而驰的那些政治家，是不能长久保持政权的。在我看来，“美国新闻与世界报道”的主编在这一点上是错了：人民要求和平的情绪不但对西欧许多政治家的行动开始发生了影响，而且在世界的其他部分——英帝国属下各国、拉丁美洲各共和国，甚至美国国内都引起了回声。至于我们和平拥护者，我们是不会提出保留和平纲领著作权的要求的，我们也不会责备人们过了这么久才想到了需要协商，我们却是准备着支持任何一国的任何一位政治家的任何一项建议，只要这个建议是出于真心诚意地要缓和国际间紧张的空气，为光荣的协议找出道路来。
    同时，我们不要使自己陶醉于和平的初步胜利，陶醉于庆贺、道喜和鼓掌。战争势力根本没有觉得它们自己已被打倒，朝鲜的协议对它们只是第一个大的挫折。它们还没有死心，还希望在其他地方捞回它的损失。这些黑势力许多年来使人类一直处于惊惶不安之中，如果认为他们轻易会把自己的目的放弃，这是天真的想法；他们之中一些人为贪婪无厌所主宰，另一些患着狂妄的恐怖病，还有一些渴望着统治的权力——所有这一切都不是容易治的毛病。看一看朝鲜协议成立以前那几天内美国报纸的市场栏，是很有益的。六月一日纽约市场上的股票跌得很厉害；六月四日跌得还要厉害。杜邦和克雷斯勒的公司、“通用电气公司”、“铝公司”的股票都在下跌之列；跌得特别厉害的是航空工业的股票。最后，六月九日又出现了一次新的更猛烈的跌风。“华尔街日报”写道：“有些人已经开始在谈论和平的危险了。”
    如果说，一些人由于贪婪无厌所以讨厌协议，那么其他拥护战争的家伙就被狂热的信仰、对进步的盲目憎恨和对未来的恐惧蒙住了心。我们看到汉城的统治者多么顽固地渴望着使朝鲜的流血继续下去。如果朝鲜的停战吓坏了李承晚，那么各大国和平协商解决德国问题的思想就会使阿登纳坐立不安。不久前“德意志通讯社”从波恩发出的报道说：“由于西方列强可能在最近和苏联举行关于德国问题的谈判，联邦政府拟向西方各强国正式提出，要求他们不和东方发生任何接触。”最后，战争的势力仍在施用压力，想影响某些国家的政策。工党领袖艾德礼在他的讲演中说——这次讲演很受保守党员的欢迎：
    “美国有一些人不愿意进行和平的调整，这个事实是应该注意的。有些人一心想把战争扩大到中国去，干脆来一个反共战争。”美国女记者陶乐赛·汤姆生在“华盛顿明星报”中写道：“据说，所有的美国人，毫无例外，都希望和平。但是‘和平’在目前的条件下只能是这样的：它是由协商得到而不是强迫接受的。范佛里特将军不要这样的和平，参议员麦卡锡也不喜欢。恰恰相反，这位参议员显然希望不但把战争扩大到中国，而且把英国卷进去——击沉英国的轮船，换句话说，就是向全世界宣战。”不用说，我不想夸大，也不为英国轮船的命运担心，但闭起眼睛不看要战争——冷战和热战——的人的拚命挣扎，也是幼稚的。我们应该不倦地工作，使人人都了解真相。我们应该尽最大的努力，使千千万万的人们的呼声更嘹亮地响起来，达到那些不愿意听的人们的耳边，我们应该努力使所有的政府重视的是人民的和平愿望，而不是一小撮生意人或政客的阴谋。
    我们知道和平的道路是不容易走的。只有头脑简单的人才会设想人类一觉醒来就能抬头看到完全协议的青天。不过，和平的初步成就已经引起一些变化了。冷战所带来的精神上的暗影，产生了虚幻的障碍，而把真正的陷阱掩盖起来。现在光明发挥了自己的作用。各国人民的面前出现了许多问题，首先是有关他们国家的主权的问题。这个问题是由许多政治家采纳了社会舆论的要求而用种种方式提出来的。孟戴斯—弗朗斯说：“精神上的团结和思想上的一致再也不应该因从属而受累，虽然大家对于取消从属都很感兴趣……欧洲各国的部长都排队朝见过美国的新政府了。难道这样就能创造欧洲了么？”这几句话是值得玩味的。邱吉尔的讲演也以不同的调子高声响了起来。美国的“新闻周刊”在讨论这篇演说的时候说：“温斯顿爵士知道，在外交问题上表示不受华盛顿的控制，是很有利的……”布宜诺斯艾利斯、罗马、哥本哈根、里约热内卢，到处都有保卫主权独立的呼声。这里，我再举“每日快报”这张平常很谨慎的保守党报纸的几句激烈的话：“美国还老是在说给英国钱，但英国现在是应该拒绝这些金元了。这只会使它更强，而不会把它削弱。”
    可能，有些怀疑的人会说，我们苏联人太喜欢强调西方各国间的龃龉，认为这就是和平的保证的所在。事情当然不是这样。我们是希望各族人民和所有的国家之间都保持和平的。我们是希望和平的——建立在互相尊重和平等的基础之上的和平的。
    我觉得，现在大家都了解，一个国家如果参加了
    一切都由那个最强的或是最富有的国家单独决定的战争集团，那它的主权是受着多大的威胁。这种威胁由于许多主权国家的领土上有着外国的军事基地而更严重了。在这些条件下，主权国家对于不卷入违反自己意志的战争中去，是不可能有什么把握的。就拿那个所谓“欧洲联邦”来说吧，这个组织的产生不是出于欧洲人民的愿望，而是别一个大陆上的代表强迫他们接受的。不久前到过巴黎、波恩及荷、比、卢三国的“泰晤士报”的一个记者写道：“任何一个来到西欧国家的首都并和各政党的领袖谈过话的人，看到人们对于成立欧洲防御同盟的计划毫无热烈的表示，一定会觉得万分奇怪的。”塔布衣夫人在“内幕新闻”上指出：“反对巴黎条约，这在我国几乎已经成了人们一致的态度了。”英国的报纸上充满着反对把英国拖进敌对中国的行动中去的意见，这里我不预备多引了。这些文章与其说是自尊心受了伤害而写的，毋宁说作者很有常识。英国虽有很多伟大的幻想家，但它是善于现实地思考的，它已经从若干破坏它的主权的图谋中看出了直接的威胁。在不久前举行的选举中，意大利人民表明了自己对卑躬屈膝、仇视和战争的政策的唾弃。还需要谈谈一些小国的情形么？不久前丹麦的首相承认：“当然，外国军队驻扎在我们国内，谁也不会高兴的。”拉狄卡尔·达尔高特宣称：美国空军飞行员的来到丹麦，是对“丹麦的一个直接的威胁”。“斯德哥尔摩晨报”也说：“黩武的军阀蹂躏一切，丝毫不顾小国的愿望，不顾它们对自由的热爱，至于冠冕堂皇的诺言更不必说了……举例来说，如果挪威的国土上驻了同盟国的飞机，现在它的地位不是要差得远么？挪威在这个问题上采取了否定的立场，它是表现了完全自然的，并且从民族的观点上看非常正当的利己主义。”
    是的，主权国家反对外国军队驻扎在自己的领土上、反对成立种种由外国人指挥的“超民族的军队”，这不但从民族的观点看是正当的，即使从国际的观点看也是正当的。这个问题不仅仅和这一个或那一个国家有关，而是和所有的国家都有关系的，因为，从属于一个统治者、有时从属于一个强国的秘密势力的侵略集团，外国的军事基地，以及建立“超民族的军队”等等都只有使战争的危险更加严重。我们，和平的战士，热烈支持所有主张在国际监督之下逐步进行普遍裁军的真诚的建议。但如果谁要想把报复主义者武装起来，用表面上是国际机构实际却是一个强国的参谋部监督的办法来建立新的军队，我们一定坚决反对到底。
    当然，战争的危险只有在各大国达成完全协议的时候才能最后消除。我们的目的是和平公约。但是达到这个公约的道路，我已经说过，不短，也不简单。每一个国家的人民继续正当地关心着自己的安全。也许中立人士的运动在若干国家中还没有成为一股结实的实际的力量，但是希望改变外交政策、努力保卫民族主权、不让外国建立军事基地、拒绝参加“欧洲军”、有些国家内还希望退出外国强迫接受的军事同盟的倾向，却越来越成长了。这些倾向，现在人人都应该加以注意。作为和平拥护者，我们一定要支持旨在保证国家的主权、保卫它们的安全的一切措施，我们一定要支持社会上那些虽然没有和我们一起进行争取世界和平的斗争，但却反对战争力量的阶层。
    有时，人们提出这样的一个问题，一个国家拒绝参加战争集团，怎么能够保卫自己的安全呢？这是奇怪的问题。试想，当人们在谈论整顿街道上的汽车交通、避免车辆肇祸的时候，驾驶员会反驳他们说：“很好，但是我车子的外胎可能会爆裂。”拒绝参加侵略公约，这件事本身就不是减少，而是增加一个国家的安全的机会。我们和平拥护者早就为联合国组织的新生而奋斗了，联合国组织如果遵循它的创造者们所订的原则，是能够真正保证全世界所有国家的安全的。由商谈而达成协议的精神——这种精神已经开始到处在把最后通牒、强迫接受、威胁的政策挤出去了，一定要改变“联合国组织的气候”，把它已失的威信恢复起来。而要做到这一点，就必须使中国在联合国中取得它理应据有的席位。英国的政治家懂得这一点，我希望，美国的领导者也能够明白这一点。中国参加了联合国，就能帮助它发挥自己的作用——和平保障者的作用，因为没有中国，就不可能解决庞大而复杂的亚洲所发生的争端，因为美国和中国代表的第一次亲切的握手将不但使印度人和缅甸人安心，而且也将使澳大利亚人、英国人甚至巴西人定下心来。和统一的、热爱和平的德国签订了和约，将消除在欧洲发生战争的危险。德国一定要成为一个主权国家，但是它的邻国，还有一切国家的人民都应该得到不容报复主义的精神和侵略势力复活的保证。热爱和平的德国不应该参加任何以那些共同努力打倒纳粹暴政的国家的人民为对象的军事集团或军事同盟。
    苏联为了防止侵略势力复活，曾经签订了一系列友好互助条约。举例来说，法苏和英苏条约就是这样的性质。也许，西方的若干政治家最近几年来签订了一系列不同的、有时性质相反的文件之后，早已把同苏联签订的爱好和平的条约忘掉了，但是苏联人民对于使他们的国家负起一定责任的签名，是看得非常严重的，他们依然把我所提起的这几个条约当作欧洲和平的保证，当然，如果签订条约的双方都遵守的话。
    至于比较小的国家，那么，联合国恢复它在章程上所表明的精神，加上它们可能和毗邻的国家签订的互不侵犯协定，当然要比参加战争集团更能保障它们的安全——在那种战争集团中，实际上它们连发言权都没有。
    我是说，国家的真正自主是和平的保证。可能有人会问我，这是否也适用于亚洲和非洲人民争取独立的斗争。当然，谁也不会怀疑苏联人民同情的决不是压迫者，而是被压迫者。但是我想从保卫和平的观点来答复这个问题。邱吉尔和艾德礼曾经为了若干报纸一口咬定：越南为自己的独立而斗争是苏联的阴谋，而嘲笑它们。我丝毫也不怀疑，邱吉尔和艾德礼同样也懂得，马来亚人民的那些要求是完全合情合理的。我们从寮国事件上看到的、战争力量所玩弄的种种政治花样表明，用武装来反对民族解放运动，很可能造成新的战争温床，造成朝鲜第二。正因为如此，我们，和平的战士，主张各族人民都有独立的权利坚持用协商的办法解决一切既存的冲突。
    在已经出现的新的形势下，在紧张的国际局势已经无可争辩地缓和下来的情形下，关于国家的主权和安全的问题就取得了特别重要的意义。我们苏联人抱着了解和深切的同情注视着各国人民保卫自己安全的努力。我们历来总是承认，每一个民族有权独立生存、自由选择对自己更合适的生活方式的权利。单和志同道合的朋友们是不可能缔造和平的，必须和想法不一样的、还是满肚子怀疑的人们一起来建造。现在我们不想回忆过去的非难、攻讦和威胁。我们只希望和那些并不热烈地、深切地、长久地爱我们的人们进行商谈。
    朋友们，第一阶段已经过去了。我们不能半途而止。朝鲜停战以后，接着就应该到来和平。在朝鲜的商谈之后，接着就应该进行其他的商谈：这世界上疼痛的地方太多，毛病实在太多了。我们应该更加努力为和平而奋斗，使得我们中间没有一个人在看到在布达佩斯或伦敦、莫斯科或纽约的小孩子的时候，会感到惭愧而脸红起来。在维也纳，当我说到每个民族不论大民族或小民族都有权利支配自己的命运的时候，我想起了“采煤工人在自己的家里是主人”这句法国谚语。现在我想补充几句：采煤工人一般都是和平的人，他们每个人都有自己的家、自己的快乐、自己的忧患，我深信采煤工人彼此一定能够商量出一个结果来的。
