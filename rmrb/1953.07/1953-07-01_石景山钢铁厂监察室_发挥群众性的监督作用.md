The Supervision Office of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

Plays the Supervisory Role of the Masses

The Supervision Office of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was established in February this year. Thanks to the importance attached to it by the Party and government leaders of the plant, the work of the Supervision Office has progressed rapidly, growing from one part-time cadre to five full-time cadres. As of June 6, the Supervision Office had accepted 293 cases, of which 63 are still under investigation, and the rest have been processed. The conscientious handling of these cases has played a considerable role in supervising the plant's implementation of national policies and laws, especially in protecting and saving state property.

At the beginning of its establishment, because most employees did not fully understand the nature and tasks of this new institution, the Supervision Office did not receive many reports, accusations, and suggestions from the masses, and mainly dealt with long-standing people's letters submitted by the leadership. Later, the Supervision Office seriously and conscientiously handled the case of worker Hu Wanchun's violation of labor discipline. (Hu was a worker in the coking department. He slept during working hours, deliberately put baskets and bars on the rails to be crushed by the train, and scolded people and attacked active workers at will. After in-depth investigation and confirmation of the above situation, the Supervision Office requested the plant leadership to give Hu Wanchun a demotion.) This event was communicated to various departments and workshops and widely publicized through blackboards and radio stations. The general employees were educated by this event, and the Supervision Office began to establish prestige among the masses. Since then, employees have rarely reported problems to higher-level supervisory authorities or newspapers, but instead go directly to the Supervision Office. According to statistics, when the plant's Supervision Office was first established, cases transferred from higher-level supervisory authorities and newspapers accounted for 35 percent of all accepted cases; by May, letters directly from employees increased from 65 percent to 81 percent. At the beginning, most of the problems reflected by general employees were related to personal life and welfare, then more related to cadres' work style, and now mainly related to production and material storage. For example, the large pit northwest of a blast furnace in the plant was filled with ore powder during the enemy-puppet period. This ore powder can be used for iron smelting. If all of it is excavated and resold, it is estimated that more than 3 billion yuan of funds can be recovered. After this issue was raised by employee Li Zhong, the Supervision Office immediately urged the supply section to study and deal with it. Wang Honglin, a people's supervision correspondent from the plant's repair department, reported that a stamping machine and a 50-horsepower motor were abandoned in the open air at the new airport, exposed to wind and rain, and no one was managing them. After repeated questioning by the Supervision Office, the responsible department was found and properly handled the situation, avoiding greater losses. The chimneys used for heating stoves in the plant in winter were arbitrarily discarded every year after winter, resulting in rust and damage, and new ones were bought the following year. After Wang Honglin reported this to the Supervision Office, the storage department stored the chimneys used this year, which is estimated to save the state 60 to 70 million yuan. From the 158 cases that have been processed and closed by the plant's Supervision Office, the main ones include 36 cases of exposing bureaucracy and violations of the system, 48 cases of exposing waste and providing rationalization proposals, and 45 cases of criticism and suggestions on wages, bonuses, welfare, and the rational use of cadres. In addition, according to the resolution of the plant's employee representative meeting in April, an "Accident Handling Team" led by the Supervision Office was established to responsibly handle 15 long-standing major accidents. For example, the major accidents of injuring and killing workers during the installation of a gas pipe in a boiler room occurred successively from November last year to January this year. The accident in which worker Wang Cunli violated operating procedures and burned down a transformer, resulting in a loss of more than 130 million yuan, also occurred long ago. In the past, employees were very dissatisfied with the failure to deal with these accidents in a timely manner, and some people thought that "the factory director did not pay attention to the safety of workers." Now, after in-depth investigation and research by the "Accident Handling Team" to clarify the causes and responsibilities of the accidents, and giving the parties administrative and legal sanctions, the employees are very satisfied, which further stimulated their enthusiasm for production. All of this shows that the work of the plant's Supervision Office in the past few months has been successful, because the exposure and handling of these problems has not only avoided a large loss of state property, but also effectively educated the vast number of employees, improved their class consciousness and political awareness, thereby directly or indirectly promoting production.

Why has the Supervision Office of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant achieved the above achievements in just a few months? There are several main reasons:

1. They have closely contacted the masses through various means, so that problems in production and work can be reflected in a timely manner. In the past, because the plant did not have a special agency to receive the masses, employees had to report their opinions to the People's Daily, Beijing Daily, or higher-level supervisory authorities. Since the official establishment of the Supervision Office, an employee reception room has been set up, which greatly facilitates the employees. People come to reflect problems or make criticisms and suggestions every day. This organization has proven to be an effective tool for enterprises to contact the masses internally. The Supervision Office has also democratically elected 113 people's supervision correspondents in various departments, sections, and workshops of the plant. The smallest unit (section) has one person, and the key department has the most with 30 people. Eighty percent of these people's supervision correspondents are workers, and the rest are technical management personnel, section chiefs, and section members, which also creates favorable conditions for the Supervision Office to contact the vast number of employees and organize mass supervision. In order to take care of the difficulties of worker comrades who serve as people's supervision correspondents who are busy with work and have low cultural levels, the Supervision Office also adopted the method of frequently and purposefully going to the workshop to find people's supervision correspondents to collect information, without emphasizing writing reports, which greatly facilitated the work of people's supervision correspondents. Recently, the Supervision Office also plans to hold a plant-wide conference of supervision correspondents, and the plant director and Party committee secretary will make further mobilization to better organize the 110-plus supervision correspondents in order to lead the activists and further mobilize the masses to supervise the factory, resolutely fight against various bad tendencies in production and capital construction, and help the leadership better complete the production plan and the capital construction plan.

2. The Supervision Office seriously handles the problems reflected by employees, which is an important reason why the work can be carried out more quickly. In order to ensure that the problems reflected by employees can be dealt with in a timely manner, they stipulate that all problems that are illegal or derelict in duty, have more opinions from the masses, and have greater responsibility, are directly inspected and handled by the Supervision Office. General problems are transferred by the Supervision Office to the relevant units in the plant for handling and then reported to the Supervision Office for record. In the process of handling, the Supervision Office also frequently supervises and inspects. In this way, the Supervision Office can grasp the larger problems with fewer people and more things, and avoid ignoring the smaller problems. Secondly, after the Supervision Office has made a decision on the problems that have been handled, the Supervision Office will check them once every Tuesday after they are handed over to the relevant units for execution, ensuring that all problems can be solved in a timely manner without delay.

3. The importance and support of the Party and government leaders of the factory is the main key to the smooth development of the work of the Supervision Office. The Supervision Office is directly under the director's office, led by the director himself, and often gives instructions on the work. When the Supervision Office was first established, the Party Committee of the factory convened a joint meeting of the heads of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, calling on all units to attach importance to the problems transferred and handled by the Supervision Office. At the plant's employee representative meeting, the director announced again: Everyone can go to the Supervision Office if they have something to do. All of this has directly supported the work of the Supervision Office. At the same time, the director of the Supervision Office is also a member of the Party Discipline Inspection Committee. He regularly reports to the director and the Party Committee, which makes the Supervision Office and various aspects of the factory closely connected, and problems can be dealt with in a timely manner when they are discovered.

4. The staff of the Supervision Office has a more scientific division of labor, and can strengthen the study of policies and business. The Supervision Office has a total of five cadres. In addition to the director being responsible for taking care of the overall situation, one person manages the plant's people's supervision correspondents, and runs to various departments and workshops to collect information and investigate problems; one person manages people's letters and reports, accusations, etc.; one person manages documents, archives, publicity, and statistics; and the other person is responsible for handling major problems and helping the leadership supervise correspondents. This detailed division of labor and cooperation improves work efficiency. In addition, in order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient experience, they have paid close attention to the study of policies and supervision work, and stipulate that Friday and Saturday afternoons are the time for learning business and researching work. They also classify and sort out people's letters, plan to accumulate materials, study and discover problems, so as to provide the leadership with improvement opinions or as a reference when handling cases.

At present, the Supervision Office of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has formulated a work plan for the next quarter according to the instructions of the plant director, mainly focusing on the central work of the entire plant, supervising and inspecting the completion of tasks by various departments, and continuing to educate employees with the handling of typical cases to further overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible and not carrying out production in accordance with operating procedures, so as to ensure the victorious completion of production tasks.

    石景山钢铁厂监察室
    发挥群众性的监督作用
    石景山钢铁厂监察室是在今年二月建立的。由于该厂党政领导干部的重视，监察室的工作开展较快，已由一个兼职干部增加到五个专职干部。截至六月六日止，监察室共受理案件二百九十三件，其中除六十三件正继续调查处理外，其余都已处理完毕。对这些案件的认真处理，在监督该厂贯彻执行国家的政策法令、特别是保护与节约国家资财上起了相当的作用。
    该厂监察室在成立之初，由于多数职工对这一新机构的性质和任务不很了解，来自群众的检举、控告和建议不多，主要还是处理领导上交下来的积压已久的人民来信。后来监察室严肃认真地处理了工人胡万春不遵守劳动纪律的事件。（胡是炼焦部的工人，在工作时间睡觉，故意把筐子、杠子放在铁轨上让车压碎，并随便骂人，打击积极的工人。监察室经深入了解证实以上情况后，提请厂的领导上给予胡万春以降级的处分。）并把这一事件通报各部门、各车间，利用黑板报和广播台作了广泛的宣传。一般职工从这一事件中受到了教育，监察室也开始在群众中建立了威信。自此以后，职工们有问题很少向上级监察机关或报社反映，而是直接去找监察室。据统计，该厂监察室初成立时，受理上级监察机关和报社转去的案件，占全部受理案件的百分之三十五；到五月份直接来自职工的信件则由百分之六十五增加到百分之八十一。一般职工所反映的问题，开始时个人生活福利的居多，往后是有关干部作风的多，现在则主要是有关生产和物资保管方面的。如该厂某高炉西北方的大坑是在敌伪时用矿石粉填起来的，这种矿石粉可以炼铁，如全部挖出转售，估计可收回资金三十多亿元。这一问题经职工李中提出后，监察室立即督促供应科研究处理。该厂修理部人民监察通讯员王洪林反映，新机场有一架冲压机和一座五十匹马力的电动机被露天弃置，风吹雨打，无人管理。经监察室多次追问，找到了负责部门，作了妥善的处理，避免了更大的损失。该厂冬季生火炉用的烟筒，每年过冬后，任意弃置，以致生锈损坏，来年再买新的。王洪林向监察室揭发后，保管部门便把今年用过的烟筒保管了起来，估计可给国家节省六、七千万元。从该厂监察室已经处理结案的一百五十八个问题来看，其中主要的有揭发官僚主义、违反制度的三十六件，揭发浪费和提供合理化建议的四十八件，对于工资、奖金、福利和干部合理使用问题提出批评和建议的四十五件。此外，根据四月里该厂职工代表大会的决议，成立了以监察室为主的“事故处理小组”，对长期积压的重大事故十五起作了负责的处理。如安装某锅炉房煤气管时砸伤和打死工友的重大事故，是去年十一月到今年一月先后发生的，工人王存立违反操作规程烧毁变压器因而损失一亿三千多万元的事故，也是早就发生了的。过去，职工们对这些事故得不到及时处理很有意见，有的人认为是“厂长不重视工人的安全”。现在经“事故处理小组”深入调查研究，弄清楚了事故发生的原因和责任，分别给与当事人以行政和法律处分后，职工们都很满意，进一步激发了他们的生产积极性。这一切都说明，该厂监察室几个月来的工作是有成绩的，因为这些问题的揭发和处理，不仅避免了国家资财的大量损失，而且有效地教育了广大职工，提高了他们的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，从而直接或间接地推进了生产。
    石景山钢铁厂监察室为什么在短短的几个月获得上述的成绩呢？有以下几个主要的原因：
    一、他们通过各种方式，密切地联系了群众，因而生产和工作中的问题能够及时反映上来。过去该厂由于没有专门接待群众的机构，职工有意见只好向人民日报、北京日报或上级监察机关反映。自监察室正式建立后，就设置了职工来访接待室，大大地便利了职工群众，每天都有人前往反映问题或提出批评建议。这一组织已经证明是企业内部有效联系群众的工具，监察室还在该厂各处、科、各车间民主选举了一百一十三名人民监察通讯员，最小的单位（科）是一个人，关键部门最多者有三十人。这些人民监察通讯员中有百分之八十的是工人，其余是技术管理人员和科长、科员等，也为监察室联系广大职工、组织群众性的监督创造了有利条件。为了照顾担任人民监察通讯员的工人同志工作忙、文化水平低的困难，监察室还采取了经常有目的地到车间去找人民监察通讯员搜集情况的办法，不强调写报告，因而大大便利了人民监察通讯员的工作。最近监察室还计划召开一次全厂监察通讯员会议，由厂长、党委书记作进一步的动员，将一百一十多名监察通讯员更好地组织起来，以便带动积极分子，进一步发动群众监督工厂，坚决与生产和基本建设中的各种不良倾向进行斗争，帮助领导更好地完成生产计划和基本建设计划。
    二、监察室认真地处理了职工反映的问题，这是工作能够较快开展的一个重要原因。他们为了使职工反映的问题能够及时得到处理，规定凡属违法失职的、群众意见比较多的、责任比较大的问题，都由监察室直接检查处理。一般问题，则由监察室转厂内有关单位处理后，报监察室备案，在处理过程中，监察室还经常督促检查。这样就使得监察室在人少事多的情况下，能够抓住较大的问题，而又不致忽略了较小的问题。其次监察室已经作了处理决定的问题，交有关单位执行后，监察室每星期二去检查一次，保证了所有问题能够得到及时解决，不致有拖延现象。
    三、工厂党、政领导的重视和支持，是监察室工作顺利开展的主要关键。监察室直属厂长室，由厂长亲自领导，并经常指示工作。在监察室刚建立时，厂的党委会曾经召集党、行政、工会和青年团负责人的联席会议，号召各单位重视监察室转交处理的问题。在该厂的职工代表大会上，厂长又宣布：大家有事可以去找监察室。这一切对监察室的工作都起了直接支持的作用。同时监察室主任也是党的纪律检查委员会委员，他对厂长、对党委会都有定期汇报，这就使监察室和厂内各方面的联系很密切，发现了问题能及时得到处理。
    四、监察室的工作人员有较科学的分工，并能加强政策和业务的学习。监察室共有干部五人，除主任负责照顾全局外，一个人管理全厂人民监察通讯员，并跑各部门、各车间搜集情况，调查问题；一个人管理人民来信和检举、控告等；一个人管理文书、档案、宣传和统计等工作；另一人负责处理重大问题和帮助领导监察通讯员。这种细致的分工合作，提高了工作效率。此外他们为了克服经验不足的困难，对政策和监察工作业务的学习抓得很紧，规定每星期五、六下午为学习业务和研究工作的时间。他们还把人民来信加以分类整理，有计划地积累材料，研究发现问题，以便向领导上提供改进意见或作为处理案件时的参考。
    目前，石景山钢铁厂监察室，已根据厂长的指示拟定了下一季度的工作计划，主要是围绕全厂的中心工作，监督和检查各部门完成任务的情况，并继续以典型事例的处理教育职工，进一步克服无人负责和不按操作规程进行生产的现象，以保证生产任务的胜利完成。
