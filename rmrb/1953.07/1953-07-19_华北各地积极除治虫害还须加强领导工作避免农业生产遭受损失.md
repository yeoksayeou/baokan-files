North China: Various areas are actively eliminating pests threatening grain and cotton production increases, such as locusts, cotton aphids, and armyworms. Leadership departments in most areas are paying close attention to pest control work. Regarding locust elimination, Hebei Province has prepared more than 5 million jin of "666" pesticide powder, 10,000 sprayers, and trained more than 15,000 scouts, sprayers, and bait spreaders. Eradication work has already been carried out on more than 140,000 mu of land. In some areas, such as Huanghua County in Hebei Province, locust nymphs have been basically eliminated after treatment. In terms of eliminating cotton aphids and red spiders, the entire region has prepared 4.5 million jin of tobacco leaves, 4.8 million jin of cotton oil soap, 500,000 jin of sulfur powder, and 150,000 sprayers. These medicines and equipment are enough for a general treatment of half of the cotton fields in the entire region. Cadres and masses in many areas have started eradication work with sufficient supply of medicines and equipment. For example, in Qiu County, Hebei Province, 49 cadres were dispatched and 14,000 people were mobilized to eliminate cotton aphids, and more than 70,000 mu were treated in three days. Regarding the elimination of armyworms, the masses in many areas have taken action. In the northern suburbs of Tianjin, under the strong leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and the District Government, Dazhang Village alone mobilized 400 people in one day to capture and kill 2,000 jin of armyworms. In Huguan County, Shanxi Province, more than 1,300 people were mobilized to capture and kill more than 500 jin of armyworms in six days. Shanxi Province sent eight technical cadres to Yucheng Prefecture to guide armyworm control work, and mobilized the masses to use methods such as digging trenches to block and eliminate them.

However, some leaders in a few areas still do not pay enough attention to pest control work; many cadres and the masses have varying degrees of complacency and the idea of relying solely on medicines and equipment. As a result, the understanding of the pest situation is not accurate, and the preparation of medicines and equipment is insufficient or used improperly. For example, Hangu Town in Hebei Province reported on June 18 that there were no locust nymphs, but on June 22 it reported that there were more than 1,500 mu where locust nymphs had occurred, and most of them had reached the fourth or fifth instar. In Ningjin County, there were more than 4,600 mu of locust nymphs, which had grown to the second to fourth instar, and some had become flying locusts, but had not yet been eliminated. Wuqing, Baodi and other counties emphasized the busy work of dividing districts and townships, and their leadership in locust control work was not effective. Xianxian, Raoyang and other counties shirked responsibility for locusts in the junction of administrative divisions, and no one was responsible. In Daming County, aphids were widespread in more than 90,000 mu of cotton fields, and only 30,000 jin of tobacco leaves and 10,000 jin of cotton oil soap were prepared, which was far from the actual need. The same situation exists in the prevention and control of armyworms. Therefore, all regions must further strengthen the organizational leadership of pest control work. Areas with serious pest infestations should regard pest control and seedling protection as one of the important tasks of current agricultural production work. It is necessary to educate cadres and the masses to overcome complacency and the idea of relying on heaven; overcome the idea of solely relying on medicines and equipment without actively organizing manual capture, and arrange pest control, weeding, dividing districts and townships, and township elections. In pest control work, attention should also be paid to mobilizing women and children to participate. Technical guidance stations at all levels should immediately and systematically launch technical training work, and teach the masses the techniques of using medicines and equipment by summarizing the local masses' pest control experience. The main agents for eliminating cotton aphids and red spiders this year are still tobacco leaves and cotton oil soap, but because the specifications of the finished medicines are inconsistent, the mixing amounts and effects are also inconsistent. Technical guidance cadres in various places must guide the masses to conduct drug efficacy tests before use to avoid losses to the masses during use. In areas where "1605" is mainly used, there must be a special person in charge, and the masses must not be allowed to mix and use it indiscriminately to prevent poisoning of people and animals. Under the current conditions, armyworms are still mainly captured manually. The masses should generally master the technology of picking egg-laying leaves; promote the use of armyworm vehicles, armyworm nets and other capture methods and the various creations of the masses. In order to do a good job in the supply of medicines and equipment, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments should cooperate well, and transport the medicines and equipment already prepared in the entire region to the pest-infested areas in a planned and timely manner, and mobilize the masses to purchase voluntarily; and conduct drug efficacy tests before selling. Those that are invalid or have poor effects should be stopped from being sold to avoid losses to the masses.

    华北各地积极除治虫害还须加强领导工作避免农业生产遭受损失
    华北若干地区正积极除治威胁粮棉增产的蝗虫、棉蚜、黏虫等虫害。大部地区的领导部门对害虫的防治工作都很重视。在除治蝗虫方面，河北省已备好“六六六”药粉五百多万斤，喷粉器一万架，训练了侦察、喷粉、撒饵队员一万五千多人，并且已在十四万多亩的面积上进行了除治工作。有的地区如河北省黄骅县的蝗蝻经过除治现已基本消灭。在除治棉蚜、红蜘蛛方面，全区已备妥烟叶四百五十万斤、棉油皂四百八十万斤、硫磺粉五十万斤和喷雾器十五万架。这些药械约够全区二分之一棉田普治一遍之用。许多地区的干部和群众在药械充分供应下已开始了除治工作。如河北省邱县在除棉蚜中出动干部四十九人，发动群众一万四千人，三天就除治了七万多亩。在除治黏虫方面，许多地区的群众已行动起来。天津市北郊区在市农林局、区政府大力领导下，仅大张村一天即发动四百人，捕打黏虫二千斤。山西省壶关县动员群众一千三百余人，六天捕打了黏虫五百余斤。山西省派技术干部八人到榆次专区指导防治黏虫工作，并发动群众用挖沟封锁等办法除治。
    但仍有少数地区的领导干部对除虫工作还不够重视；不少干部和群众存有不同程度的麻痹思想和单纯依靠药械的思想；因而对虫情掌握不确实，药械准备不足或使用不当。如河北省汉沽镇在六月十八日还报告没有发生蝗蝻，在二十二日就报告发生蝗蝻的已有一千五百多亩，且大部已达四、五龄。宁津县有四千六百多亩蝗蝻，已长到二至四龄，个别已成飞蝗，还没有除治。武清、宝坻等县强调划乡工作忙，对治蝗工作领导不力。献县、饶阳县等对行政区划的接合部的蝗虫，互相推诿，互不负责。大名县九万多亩棉田普遍发生蚜虫，仅准备烟叶三万斤、棉油皂一万斤，与实际需要相差很远。在防治黏虫工作中，也有同样情况，因此，各地必须进一步加强防治虫害的组织领导工作。虫害严重的地区，应以除虫保苗为目前农业生产工作的重要任务之一。必须教育干部和群众，克服麻痹大意、迷信靠天的思想；克服单纯依靠药械不积极组织人工捕打的思想和很好地安排除虫、锄苗、划乡、乡选等工作。在除虫工作中并注意发动妇女和儿童参加。各级技术指导站应立即有计划地展开技术传授工作，通过总结当地群众的除虫经验，把药械使用的技术教给群众。除治棉蚜、红蜘蛛的药剂，今年仍以烟叶、棉油皂为主，但因成药规格不一致，其配合量和效果也不一致，各地技术指导干部，必须指导群众在使用前作好药效试验，以免群众在使用中受到损失。重点使用“一六○五”的地区，必须有专人掌握，不得让群众乱配乱用，严防人畜中毒。黏虫在目前条件下，仍以人工捕打为主，应使群众普遍掌握采卵叶技术；推广使用黏虫车、黏虫兜等捕打方法和群众的各种创造。为作好药械供应工作，供销合作社与农业部门应很好地配合，有计划地及时地将全区已备妥的药械运到虫害区，发动群众自愿购买；并在售卖前作好药效试验。失效和效果不良的应停止推销，以免群众遭受损失。
