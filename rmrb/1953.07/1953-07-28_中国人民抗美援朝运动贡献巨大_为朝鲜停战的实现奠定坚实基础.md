Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Over the past three years, the Chinese people have made tremendous efforts and brilliant contributions to resisting American imperialist aggression, assisting the Korean people's war of self-defense, safeguarding national security, and ultimately achieving peace in Korea.

Since the United States launched the war to invade Korea on June 25, 1950, and invaded our country's Taiwan, the peace-loving Chinese people have expressed great indignation at the US aggression and issued serious warnings. However, the US aggressors disregarded our people's protests and continued to madly wage the war of aggression against Korea, and brazenly advanced towards the Yalu River, our northeastern border, seriously threatening our country's security. At the same time, US planes constantly violated our country's northeastern airspace, strafing and bombing our people, and US warships constantly shelled our merchant ships, destroying the lives and property of our people. Under unbearable circumstances, our people stepped forward and launched the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. In order to realize the will of our people, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea in late October of the same year and fought alongside the Korean People's Army to resist the US aggressors.

Over the past three years, the people of the whole country have made tremendous efforts in the great movement to resist America and aid Korea. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, medical workers, and patriotic people from all walks of life and all ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Workers and peasants signed up to join the Volunteer Army, and moving stories of mothers sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers vying to enlist emerged everywhere. Thousands of railway workers, truck drivers, and farmers organized transportation teams and stretcher teams to the Korean front to undertake various transportation and logistical tasks. Medical workers organized a large number of medical teams to serve the Chinese and Korean forces. The people in the rear provided strong support to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army in terms of material and morale. Around "May Day" in 1951, people from all walks of life across the country widely held large-scale demonstrations to resist America and aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. More than 229.9 million people participated. The people of the whole country also launched a movement to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. By May 1951, the people of the whole country had donated more than 1.26 million comfort items and more than 770,000 comfort bags. During this period, the vast number of workers and peasants launched a patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy in response to the call of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." "People contribute people, money contributes money, and grain contributes grain" - this was the action slogan automatically put forward by the people of the whole country to express their firm determination and strength to resist America and aid Korea.

In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, more than 80% of the people across the country received patriotic and internationalist education, and basically eliminated the various reactionary ideas such as "worshiping America," "fearing America," and "flattering America" left over from the US imperialist military, political, economic, and cultural aggression against China for more than a hundred years and the dark rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. This greatly enhanced national self-esteem and self-confidence, and strengthened the determination to fight against the enemy and repel American aggression. It was precisely on this ideological basis that a powerful material force was generated to support the Korean people in resisting aggression and defending peace in the Far East and the world.

Another great contribution made by our people in the movement to resist America and aid Korea was the nationwide campaign to donate weapons. This movement spread to all regions and all strata of people throughout the country. This movement was carried out in conjunction with the movement to increase production and practice economy, thus effectively promoting our country's production and construction work. According to statistics, as of May 1952, the people of the whole country had donated money equivalent to the value of 3,710 fighter planes, that is, more than 5565.0623 billion yuan in Renminbi. Encouraged by a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, the vast majority of regions overfulfilled their donation plans. For example, the original donation plan for Shanghai was 501.8 billion yuan in Renminbi, equivalent to approximately 334 fighter planes and one anti-aircraft gun. The result of the donation was a total of 849.136852889 billion yuan in Renminbi, equivalent to 566 fighter planes, exceeding the plan. Many moving deeds emerged in the donation. Luo Runsheng, a worker at the Fucheng Coal Mine in Hebei, donated all of his 2 million yuan in wages, which he had saved through frugality for more than two years. Wu Gunishahan, a 103-year-old Uyghur woman in Dihua City who was known as "Volunteer Army Mom," donated the money she earned by picking wheat ears and spinning thread. Many cadres, students, and people from the medical, business, cultural, and artistic circles also fully demonstrated their patriotic enthusiasm in the donation. Many cadres saved their allowances and students saved their breakfast and candy money to donate weapons. The results of this donation movement strengthened the equipment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and greatly enhanced their military power, enabling them to more effectively strike at the US aggressors.

The Chinese people not only sent their own Volunteer Army to help the Korean people resist aggression and protect the safety of the people of their country with blood and lives, but also showed great concern for the lives of the Korean people who had suffered from the disasters of war. The Chinese people transported large quantities of grain and materials across mountains and rivers to relieve the Korean people who were ravaged by the US aggressors and help them heal the wounds caused by the war. According to incomplete statistics, the materials donated by the Chinese people to relieve the Korean people in 1950 included: more than 6,000 tons of grain, 110,000 blankets, 400,000 jin of cotton, 35,000 bolts of cloth, 250,000 needles, and 20 billion yuan in Renminbi; the materials sent to Korea in 1951 included: more than 360,000 sets of cotton clothing, 150,000 pairs of shoes, 192 railcars of grain, 20 railcars of meat, 150,000 towels, and more than 1,279,000 boxes of other materials. At the same time, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also saved food and clothing and donated large quantities of grain and materials to the Korean people. In the second half of 1952 to May 1953 alone, they donated 9.3 million jin of grain. When the US aggressors carried out germ warfare in Korea, the Chinese people sent a large number of epidemic prevention teams and transported a large number of medicines and equipment to help the Korean people completely crush the US germ warfare. In future, the Chinese people will continue to help the Korean people restore and develop production, rebuild their homes, heal the wounds of war.

In addition to material relief, the Chinese people also constantly organized comfort groups to go to Korea to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the heroic Korean people. The two larger comfort visits were the Chinese People's Comfort Group to Korea headed by Liao Chengzhi in 1951 and the Second Chinese People's Comfort Group to Korea headed by Liu Jingfan in 1952. They represented the democratic parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, and the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, industrial and agricultural labor models, women, youth, students, business circles, cultural and educational circles, religious circles, and overseas Chinese from all regions of China. The members of these two comfort groups went deep into various regions in the front and rear of Korea, comforted the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people, and performed wonderful cultural programs for them, distributed more than 50 billion yuan in comfort money and comfort items, and 6,000 tons of comfort materials. These comfort visits greatly encouraged the fighting will of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and strengthened the friendship forged with blood between the Chinese and Korean people and the common belief in opposing American aggression and defending world peace.

The new upsurge of patriotism among our people is concentratedly and prominently manifested in the movement to formulate and implement patriotic pledges across the country. Patriotic pledges have become a program of action for the vast masses of people and a goal for everyone to strive for together. Through the form of patriotic pledges, people from all walks of life have combined their patriotic ideas with practical actions, turning patriotic enthusiasm into a majestic force. According to statistics from the North China region, the number of people participating in the formulation of patriotic pledges averaged about 70% of the total population in rural areas and more than 90% in urban areas. In Henan Province, 80% of the residents in cities and 60% of the farmers in rural areas formulated patriotic pledges. After the workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant formulated patriotic pledges, they continuously created three new records, greatly improving the plant's production efficiency. Many private industrialists and businessmen in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Zhangjiakou improved and improved their business operations because they formulated patriotic pledges. After the farmers in Shuoxian County, Shanxi, formulated patriotic pledges in conjunction with drought resistance work, the county's average yield increased by 10%. This movement has powerfully promoted our country's production and construction work in various aspects, providing a solid material force for the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

The people of the whole country, in the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, paid special attention to the families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers who were fighting hard on the Korean front, and carried out large-scale work to give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers. The people of the whole country regarded preferential treatment work as a major political task to consolidate national defense and consolidate the armed forces. Under the slogan of "soldiers' families first, then ourselves," the people in cities and rural areas everywhere did everything possible and took all measures to ensure the lives and production of martyrs' families and soldiers' families. During major festivals, people from all walks of life provide material and spiritual comfort to the families of martyrs and soldiers. The medical community provides free or reduced fees for the families of martyrs and soldiers to treat diseases. All schools give priority to enrolling the children of martyrs and soldiers under the same conditions, and give priority to subsidizing scholarships. In cities, the families of martyrs and soldiers are generally employed. In rural areas, farmers have implemented a fixed system of substitute farming. The farmers in Henan Province put forward the slogans of "three guarantees" (that is, guaranteeing deep plowing and meticulous farming, guaranteeing more grain production, and guaranteeing that not an inch of land is barren) and "six priorities" (that is: priority plowing, priority weeding, priority harvesting, priority threshing, priority manure delivery, and solving problems first) to encourage each other to do a good job in preferential treatment work. This not only encouraged the production enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and soldiers, but also directly encouraged the morale of the soldiers on the front line and strengthened the combat effectiveness of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

When the US aggressors were repeatedly defeated by the Chinese and Korean forces and were extremely helpless and carried out germ warfare in Korea and our country's northeast, the people of the whole country, under the slogan of "completely crushing the US imperialist germ warfare," widely carried out patriotic health campaigns. The broad masses of people fully exerted their enthusiasm and creativity, thoroughly carried out health work in cities and villages, cleaned up garbage and dust, cleaned up weeds and manure, renovated toilets, filled in sewage pits, dredged ditches, and launched mosquito, fly, and rat extermination campaigns, giving the urban and rural health environment a new look. This not only gave the most powerful blow to the US imperialist germ warfare, but also greatly improved the health conditions of the people across the country, and enhanced the people's physique and health.

The facts of the past three years fully prove that the Chinese people's tremendous contributions to resisting America and aiding Korea have laid a solid foundation for the victory of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and the realization of the Korean armistice. Now, our people are making unremitting efforts to strive for the full realization of the Korean armistice agreement, for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and for the further settlement of international disputes in the spirit of peaceful consultation, and for the lasting peace of the Far East and the world.

    中国人民抗美援朝运动贡献巨大
    为朝鲜停战的实现奠定坚实基础
    【新华社二十七日讯】三年来，中国人民为了反抗美帝国主义的侵略，援助邻邦朝鲜人民的自卫战争，保卫祖国的安全，为了最后实现朝鲜的和平，作了巨大的努力和辉煌的贡献。
    自从美帝国主义在一九五○年六月二十五日发动侵朝战争并侵略我国的台湾以后，热爱和平的中国人民对美国的侵略行为表示极大的愤慨并提出严重的警告，但美国侵略者无视于我国人民的抗议，继续疯狂地进行侵略朝鲜的战争，并悍然向我国东北边境——鸭绿江进犯，严重威胁了我国的安全。同时，美国飞机又不断侵犯我国东北领空，扫射轰炸我国人民，美国军舰不断炮击我国商船，破坏我国人民的生命财产。我国人民在忍无可忍的情况下，才挺身而出，发起抗美援朝保家卫国运动。为了实现我国人民的意志，中国人民志愿军乃于同年十月下旬进入朝鲜和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，反抗美国侵略者。
    三年来，全国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，作了巨大的努力。全国的工人、农民、知识分子、医务工作者与各界及各民族爱国人士，热烈地参加了抗美援朝运动。工人、农民纷纷报名参加志愿军，到处出现了母亲送儿子、妻子送丈夫、兄弟争相入伍的感人事迹。成千成万的铁路职工、汽车司机和农民，组织了运输队、担架队，到朝鲜前线担任战地的各种运输与勤务工作。医务工作者组织了大批医疗队，为中朝部队服务。后方的人民，在物质上和精神上对中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军作了强有力的支援。一九五一年“五一”前后，全国各地各界人民广泛举行了声势浩大的抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的示威游行。参加者有二亿二千九百九十余万人。全国人民还开展了慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的运动，到一九五一年五月止，全国人民捐献了一百二十六万多件慰问品，七十七万多个慰问袋。在这一时期，广大工人、农民，开展了爱国增产节约运动，以响应中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召。“有人出人，有钱出钱，有粮出粮”——这是全国人民自动提出的表示他们抗美援朝的坚强决心和力量的行动口号。
    在抗美援朝运动中，全国有百分之八十以上的人民受到了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，基本上扫除了美帝国主义百余年来对中国进行军事、政治、经济、文化侵略以及国民党匪帮的黑暗统治所遗留下来的“崇美”、“恐美”、“媚美”等种种反动思想，大大提高了民族自尊心和自信心，加强了同仇敌忾、打退美国侵略的决心。正是在这一思想基础上，产生了支援朝鲜人民反抗侵略、保卫远东和世界和平的强大的物质力量。我
        国人民在抗美援朝运动中所作的另一个巨大贡献，是全国规模的捐献武器运动。这一运动，普及全国各个地区和各阶层人民。这一运动是与增产节约运动结合进行的，因此，也就有力地推动了我国的生产建设工作。据统计，截至一九五二年五月，全国人民捐献了相当于三千七百一十架战斗机的价值的钱款，即人民币五万五千六百五十亿六千二百三十多万元。由于高度的爱国主义和国际主义热情所鼓舞，绝大多数地区都超额完成了捐献计划。例如上海市原定捐献计划为人民币五千零十八亿元，约折合战斗机三百三十四架，高射炮一门，捐献的结果，共计为人民币八千四百九十一亿三千六百八十五万二千八百八十九元，折合战斗机五百六十六架，超额完成了计划。在捐献中出现了许许多多感人的事迹。河北阜城煤矿工人罗润生，将两年多省吃俭用积蓄下来的二百万元工资全部捐献出来。迪化市一百零三岁的“志愿军妈妈”维吾尔族老人吾古尼沙汗，用拾麦穗和纺线换来的钱作了捐献。很多干部、学生和医务界、工商界、文艺界的人士在捐献中也充分发扬了他们的爱国热情。不少干部把自己的津贴节省下来，学生把早点、糖果费节省下来，捐献武器。这一捐献运动的成果，加强了中国人民志愿军的装备，大大提高了他们的军事威力，使他们能够更有效地打击美国侵略者。
    中国人民，不仅派出自己的志愿军用鲜血和生命帮助朝鲜人民反抗侵略保卫祖国人民的安全，而且十分关怀饱经战争灾害的朝鲜人民的生活。中国人民通过了千山万水运送了大批粮食和物资，救济在美国侵略者蹂躏下的朝鲜人民，帮助他们医治战争所带来的创伤。据不完全的统计，一九五○年中国人民救济朝鲜人民的物资计有：六千余吨粮食，十一万条毛毯，四十万斤棉花，三万五千匹布，二十五万根针，二百亿人民币；一九五一年送到朝鲜的物资计有：三十六万多套棉衣，十五万双鞋，一百九十二车皮粮食，二十车皮肉类，十五万条毛巾，另外还有一百二十七万九千多箱其他物资。同时，中国人民志愿军还节衣缩食，捐献了大批粮食和物资给朝鲜人民。仅一九五二年下半年到一九五三年五月就捐出了九百三十万斤粮食。当美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的时候，中国人民又派出了大批的防疫队，运送了大批的药品和器材，帮助朝鲜人民彻底粉碎了美国的细菌战。今后，中国人民还将继续帮助朝鲜人民恢复和发展生产，重建家园，医治战争的创伤。
    除了物资的救济以外，中国人民还不断地组织了慰问团，前往朝鲜慰问中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和英雄的朝鲜人民。较大的两次慰问，是一九五
    一年派出的以廖承志为首的中国人民赴朝慰问团和
    一九五二年派出的以刘景范为首的中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团，他们代表了中国各民主党派、各人民团体、人民解放军、以及各地区的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、工业和农业劳动模范、妇女、青年、学生、工商界、文教界、宗教界和海外华侨等各界人民；这两个慰问团的团员们深入到朝鲜前后方各个地区，慰问了中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，并为他们表演了精彩的文艺节目，分送了五百多亿元的慰劳金和慰问品，以及六千吨重量的慰问物资。这些慰问，大大地鼓舞了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战斗意志，加强了中朝人民之间用鲜血结成的友谊和反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平的共同胜利的信念。
    我国人民爱国主义的新高涨，集中地突出地表现在遍及全国的订立与执行爱国公约的运动中。爱国公约成了广大群众的爱国行动纲领，成为大家共同奋斗的目标。通过爱国公约的形式，各界人民把自己的爱国思想与实际行动结合起来，将爱国热情变为雄伟的力量。据华北区统计，参加订立爱国公约的人数，在农村平均约占全体人口的百分之七十左右；在城市平均约占百分之九十以上。河南省在城市中有百分之八十的居民订立了爱国公约，在农村中有百分之六十的农民订立了爱国公约。太原钢铁厂的工人们在订立爱国公约后，连续创造了三次新纪录，大大提高了全厂的生产效率。北京、天津、太原、张家口等城市有不少的私营工商业者因为订立了爱国公约，改善与提高了经营业务。山西朔县农民结合抗旱工作订立爱国公约后，全县平均增产一成。这一运动有力地推动了我国各方面的生产建设工作，为抗美援朝运动提供了雄厚的物质力量。
    全国人民，在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，特别关怀正在朝鲜前线艰苦奋战的中国人民志愿军战士的家属，进行了大规模的优待革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的工作。全国人民把优抚工作当成巩固国防和巩固部队的重大政治任务。在“先军属，后自己”的口号下，各地城市、农村的人民都尽一切努力、采取一切措施，以保证烈属、军属的生活和生产。逢有重大节日，各界人民对烈属、军属进行物质上和精神上的慰问。医务界免费或减费为烈属、军属治疗疾病。各个学校在同等的条件下，优先录取烈属、军属子弟，并优先补助助学金。在城市中，烈属、军属普遍就业。在农村中，农民们实行了固定代耕制。河南省的农民提出了“三保”（即保证深耕细作，保证多打粮食，保证不荒一寸土）和“六先”（即：先犁、先锄、先收、先打、先送粪、有事先解决）的口号，来互相勉励做好优属工作。这样不仅鼓舞了烈属、军属的生产积极性，而且直接鼓舞了前方战士的士气，加强中国人民志愿军部队的战斗力。
    当美国侵略者被中朝部队打得节节败退，穷极无赖而在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战之际，全国人民在“彻底粉碎美帝国主义细菌战”的口号下，广泛开展了爱国卫生运动，广大群众充分发挥了积极性和创造性，在城市和乡村中，彻底地进行了卫生工作，清除了垃圾尘秽，清理了杂草粪便，改修厕所，填平污水坑，疏浚沟渠，并开展了灭蚊、灭蝇、捕鼠运动，使城乡卫生环境焕然一新。这不仅给予美帝国主义的细菌战以最有力的打击，而且大大改善了全国人民的卫生状况，增强了人民体质和健康。
    三年来的事实充分证明，中国人民对抗美援朝的巨大贡献，为抗美援朝斗争的胜利、朝鲜停战的实现，奠定了坚实的基础。现在，我国人民正为争取朝鲜停战协定的完全实现，为朝鲜问题的和平解决，并为进一步以和平协商的精神解决国际争端，为远东及世界的持久和平事业，作坚持不懈的努力。
