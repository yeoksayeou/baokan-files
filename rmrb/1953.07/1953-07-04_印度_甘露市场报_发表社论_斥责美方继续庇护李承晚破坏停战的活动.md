Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd - Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on July 2nd, denouncing the US for continuing to adopt a policy of condoning Syngman Rhee's disruption of the armistice. The newspaper said: "Syngman Rhee knows very well that in the current situation in the Far East, a fanatic anti-communist like him will certainly receive the protection and assistance of the United States. He may anticipate that even if he carries out another activity to disrupt the armistice, the defense treaty will remain unchanged."

The editorial pointed out that the Chinese and Korean side "are justified in suspecting the motives of the United States." The editorial then cited a Xinhua News Agency report from June 28th, saying that the purpose of this defense treaty is to give Syngman Rhee "sufficient capital to more arrogantly disrupt the armistice." The editorial said, "It is obviously wrong to give unconditional protection to such an unreasonable dictator as Syngman Rhee."

On July 1st, "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published a commentary, denouncing the US's so-called argument that an armistice would be impossible without Syngman Rhee's consent. The commentary said: "The US government has handed the veto power to the South Korean dictator. Does the United States have the right to do this politically and morally without the consent of the United Nations? Isn't this a blatant contempt for the United Nations? Does the US government intend to confront the UN General Assembly with a fait accompli? … If the moral strength of the United Nations is weakened, and the United Nations becomes a rubber stamp used by major powers to act according to their own intentions, then the hope of establishing an effective world organization in the near future will vanish."

The commentary said: "Syngman Rhee resists the United Nations and attempts to undermine world peace with his 'treacherous' actions. If the prestige of the United Nations is to be maintained, he must be publicly and unambiguously condemned, and steps should be taken to bring the armistice terms into effect immediately." The commentary said that there is no reason to assume that this small dictator, who relies on the United States to supply his army, can resist the United Nations.

### 印度“甘露市场报”发表社论  斥责美方继续庇护李承晚破坏停战的活动

    印度“甘露市场报”发表社论
    斥责美方继续庇护李承晚破坏停战的活动
    【新华社新德里三日电】印度“甘露市场报”七月二日发表社论，斥责美方继续采取纵容李承晚破坏停战的态度。该报说：“李承晚知道得很清楚，在目前远东的这种局势下，像他这样一个狂热的反共分子一定会得到美国的庇护和援助的。他可能预料到，即使他再进行一次破坏停战的活动，防御条约还是维持不变的。”
    社论指出，中朝方面“怀疑美国的动机是有道理的”。社论接着援引新华社六月二十八日的报道说，这个防御条约的目的是给李承晚“以足够的本钱来更加蛮横地破坏停战”。社论说，“对像李承晚这样一个蛮不讲理的独裁者给予无条件的庇护，显然是不对的。”
    “甘露市场报”在七月一日发表评论，斥责美国方面的所谓得不到李承晚的同意的话停战就不可能的论调。评论说：“美国政府把否决权交给南朝鲜独裁者的手里。从政治上和道义上来说，美国不经联合国的同意，就有资格这样作吗？这不是公然蔑视联合国吗？难道美国政府打算使联合国大会面临既成事实吗？……如果联合国的道义力量削弱了，联合国变成了大国按照它们自己的意图行事时所使用的橡皮图章，那末关于在不久将来要建立有效的世界组织的希望就会变成泡影。”
    评论说：“李承晚以他的‘背叛’行动抗拒联合国并试图破坏世界和平。如果要维持联合国的威信，那就必须公开地、毫不含糊地申斥他，并且应该设法使停战条款立即生效。”评论说，没有任何理由可以作这样的假设：依靠美国供应其军队的这个小小的独裁者，竟能反抗联合国。
