Education of Production Innovators

The "Pravda" published an article by M. Yefremov, Secretary of the Kuibyshev Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on June 11, entitled "Education of Production Innovators," excerpted as follows:

Thanks to the discovery of production potential and the promotion of advanced experience in Kuibyshev factories and enterprises, the value of products overproduced last year alone amounted to 173 million rubles. In order to save materials, electricity and reduce waste in production, workers in Kuibyshev City and Oblast adopted more than 14,000 rationalization proposals in production during the year. This year, all enterprises have successfully completed the state plan for the first four months, with output increasing by 14 percent compared with the same period last year.

The Party organization in Kuibyshev attaches special importance to improving the cultural and technical level of workers, which is the reason for the above-mentioned production achievements. At present, more than 14,000 people are studying in night schools for young workers in Kuibyshev City and Oblast, more than 5,600 people are studying in night schools or correspondence schools of Kuibyshev universities, and 700 people are studying in night schools of Kuibyshev industrial specialized schools. This year, night schools of universities in Kuibyshev City and Oblast will also enroll more than 3,000 workers and technicians. In addition, enterprises directly conduct production technology training for workers. Last year, technical schools and training courses of enterprises trained more than 60,000 workers, of which more than 12,000 had no professional technical knowledge in the past.

Propagating the advanced experience of production innovators is of great significance for improving labor productivity. In March of this year, under the initiative of the Party organization of "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station," technical conferences were established, which mobilized the broad masses to participate in the struggle to fully use production potential and improve labor productivity. In order to widely publicize the advanced experience of production innovators, Stakhanov schools and production innovator lectures were also held.

Now, the Party district committees have begun to more widely promote the regular exchange of experience among production innovators in various factories, and have begun to send delegations of innovators to neighboring enterprises for visits. For example, recently more than 80 delegations visited the Central Volga Machine Tool Factory to learn the new lathe working method of the famous lathe operator Kolesov. In addition, the Kuibyshev Publishing House also regularly publishes books to summarize and promote the experience of Stakhanov workers.

The education of innovators, like the education of all workers, should be carried out in the spirit of highly strict requirements and opposition to conservatism, in the spirit of humility and fraternity, and in the spirit of strict compliance with labor discipline and state discipline. Attention should also be paid to improving the knowledge level of engineers and technicians who have received specialized technical education.

Party organizations and economic organizations should do everything possible to create conditions so that every worker combines his or her production activities with learning. A sense of new things should become a valuable quality of every Party and economic worker.

The Party Organization in Construction Engineering

The "Pravda" published an article by Kapitonov, Secretary of the Moscow Municipal Party Committee, on June 22, on the tasks of Party organizations in construction engineering, excerpted as follows:

Moscow's urban residential construction is proceeding on an ever-increasing scale. The entire staff of the "Moscow Urban Residential Construction Trust" played the role of the initiators of socialist emulation, successfully completed last year's plan, and handed over residential buildings with an area of more than 45,000 square meters. The Communists of this trust play a leading role in all construction sites. They are striving to improve labor productivity. In order to improve the use of construction machinery and tools, all engineering units of this trust have implemented a three-shift system, implemented a grassroots plan and a grassroots work record system, summarized work every ten days, and ensured the public disclosure of competitions. At present, the average daily workload of each worker has increased by 40 percent compared with last year.

However, in Moscow, there are still many trusts, management offices, and construction engineering offices that have not completed the plan for reducing construction costs and other quality indicators.

Many Party organizations in construction engineering have not resolutely fought against waste and extravagance. They often focus their main attention on the quantity indicators in completing the plan, while neglecting the quality of construction work and the issue of reducing costs.

In order to successfully carry out the tasks of socialist work, Party organizations must take various measures to ensure that every trust, management office, construction site, and enterprise can complete and overfulfill the state plan. Party organizations should play an important role in publicizing scientific and technological achievements and promoting the experience of advanced construction sites and production innovators. Mass political work must be carried out among construction personnel in such a way that the influence of the Party organization extends to all workers and that agitators truly reach every worker. It is especially important that the agitation work must be specific, and that vivid examples and facts should be used to mobilize construction personnel to complete the state plan with informed explanations.

The primary responsibility of Party organizations is to educate construction workers in the spirit of high socialist consciousness, the strictest observance of state discipline and labor discipline, and the spirit of uncompromising and extensive self-criticism and criticism from below against shortcomings.

It is intolerable that some individual economic leaders and Party organizations are indifferent to the orderly rectification of construction sites, do not fully utilize machinery, do not fully adopt advanced operating techniques based on high industrialization and rapid assembly line operations in construction, and do not strive to operate according to charts. It should be ensured that the mechanization of individual operating processes is resolutely transitioned to the comprehensive mechanization of construction projects, and more attention should be paid to the machine operators who have become the decisive force in construction projects.

The smooth completion of the plan and the reduction of construction costs largely depend on the design agencies. Therefore, it is very important to ensure that these agencies provide construction sites with construction drawings in a timely manner, eliminate waste in design and budgeting, and stipulate in the design the wide use of economical skeletons and effective materials and parts. In addition, the expansion and specialization of construction organizations is also a certain condition for improving and improving construction work.

Caring about the improvement of the living and living conditions of construction personnel is one of the most important responsibilities of Party organizations. We must care about the needs of construction personnel and wage a resolute struggle against those who ignore their needs and are unwilling to provide practical solutions.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    生产革新者的教育
    “真理报”六月十一日刊载了苏联共产党古比雪夫
    州委会书记麦·叶夫列莫夫的一篇文章，题目是“生
    产革新者的教育”，摘要如下：
    古比雪夫各工厂企业，由于发掘了生产潜力，推广了先进经验，在去年一年就超额生产了价值一亿七千三百万卢布的产品。为了节约材料、电力并减少生产中的废品，古比雪夫市和州的工人，一年来在生产中共采用了约一万四千多项合理化建议。今年，各企业又顺利地完成了头四个月的国家计划，产量比去年同一时期增加了百分之十四。
    古比雪夫的党组织特别重视提高工人的文化和技术水平的工作，这就是取得上述生产成绩的原因。现在，有一万四千多人在古比雪夫市和州的各青年工人夜校中学习，有五千六百多人在古比雪夫各高等学校的夜校或函授学校中学习，有七百人在古比雪夫工业专科学校的夜校中学习。今年，古比雪夫市和州各高等学校的夜校还将招收三千多名工人和技工。此外，各企业还直接对工人进行生产技术的训练。去年，各企业的技术学校和训练班就训练了六万多工人，其中有一万二千多人过去是没有一点专业技术知识的。
    宣传生产革新者的先进经验对提高劳动生产率是有重大意义的。今年三月，根据“古比雪夫水电站”的党组织的创议，创办了技术会议，这种会议动员了广大群众参加争取充分使用生产潜力和争取提高劳动生产率的斗争。为了广泛宣传生产革新者的先进经验，还举办了斯大哈诺夫学校和生产革新者演讲会等。
    现在，党的区委会开始更广泛地促使各工厂的生产革新者经常交换经验，并开始把革新者的代表团送到邻近的企业里去参观。例如，最近就有八十几个代表团到中伏尔加母机制造厂参观，学习著名的车工科列索夫的新式车刀工作法。此外，古比雪夫出版社还经常出版书籍，总结和宣传斯大哈诺夫工作者的经验。
    对革新者的教育工作也像对一切工人的教育一样，应当本着高度的严格的要求和反对保守的精神、谦虚和友爱的精神以及严格遵守劳动纪律和国家纪律的精神来进行。对于受过专门技术教育的工程师和技师的知识水平的提高，也要予以重视。
    党组织和经济组织应当尽力创造一切条件，以使每个工人把自己的生产活动和学习结合在一起。对于新事物的感觉，应成为每个党的和经济的工作人员的宝贵品质。
    在建筑工程中的党组织
    “真理报”六月二十二日刊载了莫斯科市党委书记
    卡彼托诺夫所写的论建筑工程中党组织任务的论文，
    摘要如下：
    莫斯科的城市住宅建筑，正以日益增大的规模进行着。
    “莫斯科城市住宅建筑托辣斯”的全体员工发挥了社会主义竞赛首倡者的作用，顺利完成了去年的计划，交出了面积达四万五千平方公尺以上的住宅建筑。这个托拉斯的共产党员们在一切建筑工段中起着带头作用。他们正在争取劳动生产率的提高。为了改进对建筑机器和工具的使用，这个托辣斯的所有工程单位，都实行了三班制，实施了基层计划和基层工作记录制度，每十天进行一次工作总结，并保证竞赛的公开发表。目前，每个工人的每日平均工作量已较去年提高了百分之四十。
    但是，在莫斯科，也还有许多托辣斯、管理处、建筑工程办事处没有完成降低建筑成本和其他质量指标的计划。
    很多建筑工程中的党组织没有对挥霍和浪费现象进行坚决斗争。他们往往把主要的注意力放在完成计划中的数量指标，而忽视了建筑工作的质量和降低成本的问题。
    为了成功地执行社会主义工作任务，党组织必须采取各种措施来保证每个托拉斯、管理处、建筑工段和企业都能完成和超额完成国家计划。在宣传科学和技术的成就、推广先进工地和生产革新者的经验中，党组织应当起重要的作用。在建筑人员中必须这样地进行群众政治工作，使党组织的影响遍及于全体工人，使鼓动员真正接触到每个工人。尤其重要的，是鼓动工作一定要具体，要运用生动的范例和事实，以深谙事理的说明去动员建筑人员完成国家计划。
    党组织的首要职责，是要以高度社会主义的自觉、最严格地遵守国家纪律和劳动纪律的精神，对缺点以不妥协和广泛开展自我批评及自下而上的批评的精神去教育建筑工作人员。
    一些个别的经济领导人和党组织对于建筑工地中应有秩序地整顿漠不关心，对机械没有充分利用，在施工中没有充分采用建立在高度工业化和快速流水作业法基础上的先进操作技术，没有争取按图表进行作业，这样的事实是不能容忍的。应当保证由个别操作过程的机械化坚决地过渡到建筑工程的全面机械化，更多地关怀建筑工程中成为决定性力量的机器操使员们。
    计划的顺利完成和建筑费用的降低，大抵取决于设计机关。因此，使这些机关以施工图样及时地供给建筑工地，消灭设计和预算中的浪费现象，以及在设计中规定广泛利用经济的骨架和有实效的材料及零件，这都是很重要的。此外，建筑组织的扩大和专业化，也是提高和改进建筑工作的一定的条件。
    关心建筑人员的居住和生活条件的改善，是党组织的一个最重要的责任。必须关心建筑人员的需求，并同那些漠视他们的需求，不愿予以切实解决的人，进行坚决的斗争。
