Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 20th:
    Tokyo dispatch: Under the auspices of the Japan Teachers' Union, which has over 400,000 members, the "National Rally Against Military Bases" was held in Kanazawa, the capital of Ishikawa Prefecture, on the 19th, with 8,000 people participating. Participants included villagers from Uchinada Village who are persisting in a heroic struggle, residents of Ishikawa Prefecture, and representatives from various labor unions and cultural organizations.
    The rally passed a resolution opposing the leasing of military bases to US occupation forces, and in particular opposing the leasing of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture to the US military as a firing range.
    After the rally, representatives were sent to the Ishikawa Prefecture Government and the Ishikawa Prefecture Headquarters of the National Local Police to present the resolution against military bases. Participants in the rally also went to Uchinada Village to express their condolences to the villagers who are still persisting in the sit-down strike, encouraging them to fight to the end. On the spot, 200 representatives from the rally also joined the people of Uchinada Village in their sit-down strike.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 20th: Following the victory in the struggle against the US military establishing a military exercise area on Mount Asama, the struggle of the people of Hokkaido against the US military's Tsukisamu firing range near Sapporo has also achieved victory.
    The Tsukisamu firing range covers an area of approximately 21 acres and has been occupied by the US Army since the war. Bullets from US military exercises frequently entered nearby orchards and rice paddies, endangering the lives and property of local residents. The local people repeatedly demanded an end to US military target practice in Tsukisamu. On the 16th, the US occupation authorities were forced to announce the cessation of the use of the Tsukisamu firing range.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 20th: After a long period of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Yoshida's Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, the draft budget for the Yoshida government's 1953 fiscal year (April 1953 to March 1954) was passed in the House of Representatives on the 17th in the form of a joint amendment by the Yoshida Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and Hatoyama's Liberal Party. The so-called budget amendment passed by the House of Representatives is essentially the same as the original budget draft proposed by the Yoshida government, and remains a budget used to remilitarize Japan.
    The total amount of expenditure in the budget passed by the House of Representatives reached 965,478,800,000 yen, a reduction of approximately 2.8 billion yen compared to the original budget draft of the Yoshida government. Nevertheless, it is still 3.5 percent higher than the budget for the previous fiscal year, setting a record for the highest post-war Japanese budget. In this budget amendment, various direct and indirect military expenditures still account for a large amount, with the disguised "occupation fee" under the name of "defense expenditure" reaching 62 billion yen. To confuse public opinion, the budget amendment superficially reduced the military expenditure of the disguised military "National Safety Agency" from the originally planned 72 billion yen to 65.3 billion yen. However, US Secretary of State Dulles's testimony before the US Congress on the 9th had already exposed the fact that the Japanese budget draft concealed huge military expenditures.
    The budget draft formulated by the Yoshida government in collusion with reactionary parties such as the Progressive Party has aroused the anger of the Japanese people. Other opposition parties also took the opportunity to attack it. The Left-wing Socialist Party and the Right-wing Socialist Party issued a joint statement condemning the Yoshida Liberal Party and the Progressive Party for conducting "dirty and unfair deals" on the budget issue, and pointed out that this budget案 is "a conspiracy to throw the country into another round of inflation."

    日本人民在金泽市举行反对军事基地大会
    北海道人民反对美军使用月寒打靶场的斗争获得胜利
    日本众院通过吉田政府使日本重新军国主义化的预算
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：在拥有会员四十多万人的日本教职员工会的主持下，十九日在石川县首府金泽市举行了有八千人参加的“反对军事基地国民大会”。参加大会的有坚持着英勇斗争的内滩村村民、石川县居民和各地的工会、文化团体等代表。
    大会通过决议，反对把军事基地租给美国驻军，特别是反对把石川县内滩村租给美军作为打靶场。
    会后，大会派出代表，前往石川县县政府和国家地方警察石川县本部，提出反对军事基地的决议书。参加大会的人并到了内滩村，对仍在坚持着静坐斗争的村民，加以慰问，鼓励他们斗争到底。当场并有二百名大会代表也参加了内滩村人民的静坐斗争。
        【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：继反对美军在浅间山设立军事演习场的斗争获得胜利之后，北海道人民反对札幌附近美军月寒打靶场的斗争也取得了胜利。
    月寒打靶场面积约二十一英亩，战后以来一直由美国陆军霸占。美军演习的枪弹经常射入附近的果园和稻田，危害当地居民的生命财产。当地人民曾一再要求停止美军在月寒打靶。驻日美军当局在十六日被迫宣布停止使用月寒打靶场。
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：经过吉田自由党和改进党的长期幕后交涉之后，吉田政府的一九五三会计年度（一九五三年四月到一九五四年三月）预算草案，已于十七日以吉田自由党、改进党和鸠山自由党三党的联合修正案的形式在众议院通过。众议院通过的这个所谓预算修正案，本质上和吉田政府原来提出的预算草案相同，仍然是一个用以使日本重新军国主义化的预算。
    众院通过的预算岁出总额共达九千六百五十四亿七千八百万日元，比吉田政府的原预算草案减少了约二十八亿日元。虽然如此，它仍然比上一会计年度预算增加了百分之三点五，创战后日本预算的最高纪录。在这个预算修正案中，各项直接间接军费依然占有很大数额，以“防御支出费”为名的变相“占领费”一项即达六百二十亿日元。为了迷惑舆论，预算修正案表面上把变相军部的“保安厅”军费从原定的七百二十亿日元减少到六百五十三亿日元。但是美国国务卿杜勒斯九日在美国国会上发表的证言，早已暴露了日本预算草案隐藏巨额军费的事实。
    吉田政府勾结改进党等反动党派制订的这个预算草案，激起了日本人民的愤怒。其他反对党也乘机加以攻击。左派社会党和右派社会党曾发表联合声明，谴责吉田自由党和改进党在预算问题上进行
    “不干净、不公平的买卖”，并指出这个预算案是“把国家抛入再一次通货膨胀的阴谋”。
