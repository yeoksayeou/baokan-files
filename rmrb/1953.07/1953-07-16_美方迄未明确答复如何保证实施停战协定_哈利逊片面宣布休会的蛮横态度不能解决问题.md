Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 15th. (Special Correspondent Wu Min) The U.S. Chief Delegate Harriman unilaterally announced the adjournment of the plenary meeting on the 15th without waiting for an agreement to be reached. He will return to attend the plenary meeting on the morning of the 16th. On the 14th, Harriman requested the delegation to adjourn the general assembly. The delegation's general assembly has been held for six consecutive days to discuss the implementation of the armistice agreement and preparations for signing the armistice agreement. If this is the attitude that Harriman consistently intends to adopt in the secret plenary meetings, then it is not difficult to see that this high-handed attitude is of no help in clarifying important issues related to the implementation of the armistice agreement.

The details of the delegation's general assembly have not yet been announced, but judging from the actions of Robertson and Syngman Rhee in the past few days, the Korean and Chinese side representatives have every reason to demand clarification of important issues that determine the fate of the armistice agreement before signing the armistice agreement.

The draft armistice agreement stipulates that the commanders of both opposing sides will "guarantee a complete cessation of hostilities and all armed actions in Korea pending the achievement of a final peaceful settlement." It is evident that the armistice does not have a time limit. However, Syngman Rhee of the U.S. side said that he would not obstruct the armistice for only ninety days. Robertson supported this statement when he talked about his joint statement with Syngman Rhee, saying, "If we cannot resolve our differences at the conference table, we will take whatever actions the situation requires."

Will the armistice be disrupted after a certain period? Syngman Rhee replied, yes. And Eisenhower's personal representative also agreed with this point.

Article 17 of the draft armistice agreement clearly states that "the commanders of both opposing sides shall respectively take all necessary measures and methods within the armies under their command to ensure that all their subordinates thoroughly comply with all the provisions of this armistice agreement." And one of these provisions is to hand over all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. Syngman Rhee's detention of more than 27,000 prisoners of war has already violated this agreement. The Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces did not take full responsibility to take effective measures to ensure that Syngman Rhee complied with the agreement, resulting in the suspension of preparations for signing the armistice agreement for nearly a month.

Does the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, who is preparing to sign the armistice agreement, want to guarantee the implementation of the provisions of the armistice agreement? So far, no clear answer has been received to this question.

Unless these issues are clarified, the armistice agreement may be undermined by the Syngman Rhee government at any time, because it consistently stubbornly advocates the plan of unifying Korea by force, which has been thoroughly defeated. When Syngman Rhee undermines the armistice, how will the U.S. side "guarantee a complete cessation of hostilities and all armed actions in Korea pending the achievement of a final peaceful settlement"? Obviously, unilaterally announcing the adjournment of the plenary meeting cannot clarify this issue.

### 美方迄未明确答复如何保证实施停战协定  哈利逊片面宣布休会的蛮横态度不能解决问题

    美方迄未明确答复如何保证实施停战协定
    哈利逊片面宣布休会的蛮横态度不能解决问题
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美国首席代表哈利逊没有等待取得协议便片面地宣布十五日的全体会议休会。他将回来出席十六日上午的全体会议。十四日，哈利逊曾要求代表团大会休会。代表团大会已连续开了六天，为的是讨论实施停战协定和签订停战协定的准备工作问题。如果这就是哈利逊在秘密的全体会议上所要一贯地采取的态度的话，那末，不难看出，这种蛮横的态度对于澄清有关实施停战协定的重要问题，是毫无帮助的。
    代表团大会的会议情况尚未公布，但从罗伯逊和李承晚在过去几天中的行动看，朝中方面代表完全有理由要求在签订停战协定之前，澄清足以决定停战协定的命运的重要问题。
    停战协定草案规定，敌对双方司令官将“保证在朝鲜的敌对行为与一切武装行动完全停止的停战，以待最后和平解决的达成”。由此可见，停战并没有时间的限制。但是，美国方面的李承晚说，他只是在九十天的时间以内不阻挠停战。罗伯逊在谈到他和李承晚的联合声明时支持了这种说法，他说，“假如我们不能在会议桌上解决我们的分歧，我们将采取局势所需要的一切行动”。
    停战在一定的时期以后就要被破坏吗？李承晚回答说，是的。而艾森豪威尔的私人代表也同意了这点。
    停战协定草案的第十七款明白说，“敌对双方司令官须分别在其指挥下的军队中采取一切必要的措施与办法，以保证其所有部属彻底遵守本停战协定的全部规定”。而这种规定之一就是把不直接遣返的全部战俘交由中立国遣返委员会看管。李承晚扣留了二万七千名以上的战俘，已经违反了这个协定。联合国军总司令没有负起全部责任，来采取有效的措施保证李承晚遵守协定，结果，就使签订停战协定的准备工作停顿将近一个月的时间。
    准备在停战协定上签字的联合国军总司令想保证停战协定的规定的执行吗？迄今这个问题仍然未得到什么明确的答案。
    除非把这些问题加以澄清，停战协定便随时都可能遭到李承晚政府的破坏，因为它一贯顽固地鼓吹已经遭到彻底失败的武力统一朝鲜的计划。在李承晚破坏停战时，美国方面将如何“保证在朝鲜的敌对行为与一切武装行动完全停止的停战，以待最后和平解决的达成”呢？很明显，片面地宣布全体会议休会是不能够澄清这个问题的。
