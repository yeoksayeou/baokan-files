The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine prepared to do a good job in production management during the construction process. Planning personnel drafted a production plan last year, which has recently been revised, and various technical and economic norms have been compiled to plan and implement quota management. Technical management personnel revised the operating procedures for each type of work for the workers very early on. The coal production plan for July has been distributed to each production team in advance, and "Production Instruction Charts" for daily plan completion have also been compiled. Materials personnel have purchased a large number of oils and equipment for production and are planning to build a five-room materials warehouse. Financial personnel have begun to divide the entire open-pit coal mine production process into nine divisions as units for cost accounting in order to promote cost accounting; and have drafted a financial system applicable to open-pit coal mines.

The production management organization of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine was separated from the original construction organization in the later stage of construction, and established the Production Technology Section, the Engineering Section, the Mining Section, the Transportation Section, the Overburden Removal Section, and the Dispatch Room. The mining department added coal mining teams; the coal preparation plant organization was expanded, and the transportation organization also added overburden removal stations and three electric motor stations according to production needs.

During the construction process, the open-pit mine ran three phases of open-pit technology training courses, training nearly 700 technicians and management cadres. Twenty-five technicians were also sent to fraternal mines to study the technology of managing open-pit coal mines. In-service personnel also frequently organize professional studies and participate in amateur training classes to improve their professional level. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    海州露天矿生产管理工作建立了良好基础
    阜新海州露天煤矿，在建设过程中就准备作好生产管理工作。计划人员去年就已订出生产计划，最近又加以修正，并编制出各种技术经济定额，筹划和实行定额管理工作。技术管理人员很早就给工人修订好各工种的操作规程。七月份的产煤计划，已提前发到各个生产小组，每日完成计划的“生产指示图表”也已编制出来。材料人员已购置了大批生产用的油类和器材，并在筹建一座五间大屋的材料仓库。财务人员已着手把整个露天煤矿生产过程划分为九个分部，作为核算成本的单位，以推行成本核算；并且已经草拟出了一个适用于露天煤矿的财务制度。
    海州露天矿的生产管理机构，在建设后期就已从原来的建设机构中划分出来，成立了生产技术科、工务段、采剥段、运输段、排土段和调度室等。矿务部门增设了采煤班；选煤厂机构扩大，运输机构根据生产需要，也增设了剥离站和三个电动机车站。
    在建设过程中，露天矿曾开办了三期露天技术训练班，先后培养出近七百个技术工人和管理干部。还有二十五个技术员被派到兄弟矿去学习管理露天煤矿的技术。在职人员也经常组织业务学习和参加业余训练班，以提高业务水平。（据新华社讯）
