Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 7th: According to TASS, the Italian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session concluded on July 4th.

The report by General Secretary Palmiro Togliatti was discussed at the meetings on July 3rd and 4th. Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, Pietro Secchia, pointed out at the meeting that the primary task of the Communist Party at present is to maintain and consolidate its ties with the broad masses who voted for the Communist Party and yearn for fundamental changes in Italy's political and social situation. It should also expand its influence among the broad masses of citizens who still follow the Christian Democratic Party and its economic and trade union organizations, especially in certain regions of northern and central Italy. In the south, it is necessary to persist in the struggle to free the people from the influence of royalist and fascist parties. Secchia emphasized that in order to broadly mobilize the party to complete the above tasks, the quality of the party must be improved.

At the final meeting on the 4th, a resolution was adopted, which stated:

Despite the enormous pressure exerted by the government and the church to undermine electoral freedom, democratic and popular forces still achieved victory in the June 7th elections. The deceptive electoral law failed to be implemented. The prestige of the Italian Communist Party among voters has increased, with a total of more than six million votes. Today, it is the most powerful people's party in Italy.

The Italian Socialist Party also achieved a great victory, proving that it is a powerful party of the Italian working people. The left-wing parties opposed to the Christian Democratic government received a total of approximately ten million votes.

The resolution continued: All this proves that there is widespread dissatisfaction within the country with the results of the policies pursued by the Christian Democratic government, and there are demands from all sides for a serious revision of this policy.

The Central Committee approved the resolution of the Party leadership and the Party's representatives in Parliament on the special need to ensure that the election results are considered in a democratic manner, that all government authorities respect democracy and the constitution, and that the Christian Democratic government abide by democratic procedures in the current situation.

The Central Committee agreed with the views expressed by Togliatti in his report. The Central Committee also pointed out that what Italy needs most at present is a government that can carry out broad and systematic activities to eliminate the poverty of workers, improve the general living standards of citizens, eliminate industrial stagnation, develop the southern regions, build more housing for the working people, expand foreign trade, and formulate social reform plans to benefit the people, taking these tasks as its primary mission. In order to effectively carry out these governmental activities urgently needed by the country, it is necessary to pursue a new foreign policy that eases international tensions and safeguards peace on the one hand, and to stop any discrimination against citizens and promote compliance with the constitution by all government agencies on the other. The Communist parliamentary group must follow the following guidelines: They must do their best to help create favorable conditions for the establishment of a government that can propose a democratic program that adapts to the current needs and the wishes of the masses.

    意大利共产党中央全体会议通过决议
    要求成立能适应群众愿望的民主政府
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议在七月四日闭幕。
    在七月三日和四日的会议上，讨论了总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂的报告。共产党副总书记彼特罗·谢嘉在会上指出，共产党目前的首要任务是维持和巩固与投票给共产党和渴望根本改变意大利政治和社会形势的广大群众的联系。并应在那些仍然追随天主教民主党及其经济与工会机构的广大公民群众中扩大自己的影响，特别是在意大利北部和中部的某些地区。在南部，必须坚持斗争，使人民从保皇的和法西斯的党派的影响下摆脱出来。谢嘉着重指出：为了广泛地动员党来完成以上任务，必须提高党的质量。
    四日最后一次会议上通过了一项决议，其中说：
    尽管政府和教会为了破坏选举自由使用了巨大的压力，但是民主和人民力量在六月七日选举中还是获得了胜利。骗人的选举法未能付诸实施。意大利共产党在选民中的威望增加了，一共得到了六百多万票。今天它是意大利最强大的人民政党了。
    意大利社会党也获得了巨大的胜利，从而证明它是意大利劳动人民的一个强大的党。反对天主教民主党政府的各左翼党派一共获得了约一千万张票。
    决议继续说：这一切都证明国内对天主教民主党政府奉行的政策所造成的结果都普遍表示不满，各方面都有郑重修改这个政策的要求。
    中央委员会批准了党领导方面和党在议会中的代表关于在目前局势下特别需要确保以民主方法考虑选举结果、所有政府当局应尊重民主与宪法、天主教民主党政府应遵守民主程序的决议。
    中央委员会同意陶里亚蒂在他的报告中所表示的观点。中央委员会同时指出，目前意大利最需要的是这样一个政府，它能够进行广泛的、有步骤的活动以消灭劳动者的贫穷，提高公民的一般生活水平，消除工业停滞不前的现象，开发南部地区，为劳动人民建筑更多的住宅，扩大对外贸易并制订社会改革计划造福人民，把这些工作当作它的主要任务。为了有效地进行国家迫切需要的这一些政府活动，必须一方面奉行新的、缓和国际紧张局势及维护和平的外交政策，另一方面停止对公民的任何歧视并促使所有政府机构都遵守宪法。共产党议会集团必须遵照下列方针：他们必须尽力帮助创造有利条件，以成立一个能够提出一个适应目前需要及群众愿望的民主纲领的政府。
