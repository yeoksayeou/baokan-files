    Warsaw dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, July 11: The foreign trade of the Polish People's Republic is constantly expanding, and the mutual assistance and cooperation in economic aspects between Poland and other countries in the democratic camp are further developing. In 1952, calculated at comparable prices, Poland's foreign trade volume had increased to more than twice the highest level before the war. This figure will increase further this year. In Poland's foreign trade, trade between Poland and the Soviet Union is of decisive significance. In 1952, the total value of Polish-Soviet trade accounted for 32 percent of Poland's total foreign trade for the year, an increase of seven times compared with the first year after Poland's liberation - 1945. The Soviet Union exports a large number of machines and equipment to Poland, which is of great help to Poland's industrialization and socialist construction. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also an important market for Poland's export goods. Poland's trade volume with other People's Democratic countries is also constantly increasing, and the trade volume in 1952 had increased to 67 percent of the total foreign trade for the year. In addition to exporting to these countries, Poland mainly imports the following items from these countries: mechanical equipment for coking plants and coal yards imported from the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, and iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, crude oil, petroleum products and chemical raw materials imported from Bulgaria, etc.
    Due to the rapid development of the new Polish national economy, the composition of Poland's foreign trade has undergone fundamental changes. In terms of exports, in 1952, the quantity of machines, locomotives, railway carriages, textiles and other manufactured goods exported by Poland had exceeded many times the pre-war level, accounting for about one-fifth of the total exports in that year. Now, Poland's coal exports to Northern and Western European countries have also increased to 2.5 times the pre-war level. Due to the continuous expansion of various construction projects in the process of socialist industrialization, Poland is now an important market for the large-scale sale of machines, machine tools, factory equipment, hardware and various industrial raw materials. In 1952, Poland's imports of machines and various factory equipment were six times the pre-war level, and this type of goods accounted for more than 35 percent of the total imports. The construction of the State Automobile and Tractor Factory has increased the country's need for rubber and oil. The development of light industry has also greatly increased the need for wool, cotton, jute and raw hides.

    波兰对外贸易日增
    【新华社十一日讯】华沙消息：波兰人民共和国对外贸易不断扩大，对民主阵营其他各国间经济方面的互助合作关系进一步发展。在一九五二年，按比较价格计算，波兰的对外贸易额已增为战前最高额的两倍多。今年这一数字还将增加。在波兰对外贸易中，波兰和苏联之间的贸易具有决定性的意义。在一九五二年，波苏贸易总值占波兰全年对外贸易总值的百分之三十二，比波兰解放后头一年——一九四五年增加了七倍。苏联向波兰输出大批的机器和装备，对于波兰的工业化和社会主义建设事业有着很大的帮助，同时，苏联又是波兰出口货的重要市场。波兰对其他人民民主国家的贸易额也在不断增加，贸易额到一九五二年已增为全年对外贸易总额的百分之六十七。波兰除向这些国家输出外，它从这些国家输入的物品主要的有：从德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克输入的炼焦厂和煤场的机械装备，从保加利亚输入的铁和钢材、有色金属、原油、石油制品和化学原料等物品。
    由于新波兰国民经济的迅速发展，波兰对外贸易的组成成分已起了根本变化。在出口方面，一九五二年，波兰出口的机器、机车、铁路车皮、织品和其他制成品的数量已超过战前许多倍，在这一年的出口总量中约占五分之一。现在，波兰运往北欧和西欧各国的煤也增加到战前的二点五倍了。由于社会主义工业化过程中各种建设工作规模不断扩展，波兰现在是一个大量销售机器、工作母机、工厂设备、五金和各种工业原料的重要市场。一九五二年，波兰进口的机器和各种工厂设备为战前的六倍，这种货物占入口总量的百分之三十五以上。国家汽车和拖拉机工厂的兴建增加了国家对橡胶和石油的需要。轻工业的发展，使羊毛、棉花、黄麻和生皮的需要也大大增加了。
