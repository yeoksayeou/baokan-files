    A “Key Point” That Failed to Play a Key Role
    Xiang Yang
    This spring, the Xinjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province decided to make Shunjiang Township the production focus of the entire county, and dispatched a work team at the end of March to directly lead it. The work team then determined that the Second Village would be the focus of Shunjiang Township. After the work team went to the countryside, they buried themselves in the "point," neglecting leadership over the "area." Later, because of urgent tasks, they began to go to other villages, but not to lead production, but to mobilize laborers. They did not discover or solve any problems in other villages, nor did they have a good understanding of the specific conditions of other villages. Because of the neglect of leadership over the "area," the work in the point and the area differed greatly. For example, when promoting the mud-water seed selection method, the masses in the Second Village generally adopted this advanced method; however, in the First Village, which is adjacent to the Second Village, some people only knew that "mud-water seed selection is good," but did not know how to do it. When going to market, the masses in other villages spread the word to each other: "The Second Village is the key point, we are not the key point, it doesn't matter if we are a little worse." The work team also organized "demonstration promotions," but the preparations were insufficient, and the results were not significant. The cadres planning the demonstration attempted to "explain" all the methods from then until the autumn harvest in one demonstration, without knowing that the demonstration should be carried out throughout the entire production process. When the masses began to arrive, the cadres of the work team found the mutual aid team leader being observed and temporarily summarized their experience and practices, researching what to say and how to say it. The masses came in twos and threes, and left in twos and threes because they were impatient. When it was time for the demonstration, including the person being observed and a few cadres from the work team, there were fewer than twenty people in total, who walked around in a cold and desolate manner, and then the cadres said some things that were divorced from the masses' thinking, and that was considered the end of the "demonstration," which, as a result, made some people even more skeptical of advanced experience.

    The work team cadres who buried themselves in the "point" could not see the surrounding situation and lacked a correct assessment of the general villages and the villages with lagging work. When publicizing new-style seedling fields, they simply looked at the "no big problem" from the advanced village of the Second Village and mistakenly thought that "other villages may be similar," so they did not put in more effort in the general villages and backward villages. When the Second Village had planted "almost all," the cadres went to other villages, and many farmers had already planted using the old methods. Many cadres of the work team went to the general villages and just "ran around," finding the village head and chairman to hold meetings, without understanding what it means to go deep or where to go deep.

    The cadres of the work team did not quite understand what role the work of the "point" was supposed to play, nor did they understand how to do the work of the "point." They were divorced from the thinking of the local masses and the original farming techniques of the masses, and they promoted advanced production experiences from other places, even copying entire sets of "scientific technologies" and asking the masses to follow suit. The masses and village cadres expressed great "welcome" on the surface, saying "accept," but actually they did not believe it. Behind their backs, they said: "These scholars are just good at talking! I've been engaged in production all my life, and I don't know how to do it well?" When the cadres of the work team talked to the chairman of the First Village's farmers' association about seedling field management, the chairman of the farmers' association quickly said a set of advanced experiences, saying that he had thought it through; but when it came to how he would do it himself, he found a pile of objective reasons to explain that he "cannot adopt this method this year." In fact, although most of the masses did not implement the "standard" new-style seedling fields, they had all begun to change their past practices. Farmers are overcoming the traditional conservative thinking of thousands of years and adopting a step-by-step approach, which is very reasonable. However, many cadres of the work team used the so-called "standards" and "science" to demand farmers in a way that was divorced from reality, and they could not see the progress of the peasant masses. When they saw that the farmers' work was "not up to standard" and not as "beautiful" as they thought, they felt less motivated. They did not cherish the progress of the masses, so naturally they could not seize the existing more progressive practices and promote them to the general villages.

    Another major shortcoming of the work team was that they took care of everything themselves, only doing their own work, and were unrelated to the township government. They did not pay attention to cultivating activists and backbones, and they did not fully mobilize the village cadres. This is also one of the reasons why the point and the area could not be well integrated.

    The Second Village did not play the role it should have as a key village in Shunjiang Township, and Shunjiang Township did not play the role it should have as a key township in Xinjin County. After the Xinjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established a key point here and sent a work team, how did it lead it? Why do the county committee, the work team, and the township government seem to be unrelated? The Xinjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should seriously examine and improve these issues.

### 一个没有起重点作用的“重点”

    一个没有起重点作用的“重点”
    向阳
    今年春天，中共四川新津县委决定以顺江乡为全县的生产重点，并在三月底派出工作组去直接领导。工作组又确定以第二村为顺江乡的重点。工作组下了乡，就钻到“点”里去了，但忽视了对“面”的领导。后来因为有突击任务，他们才开始到其他村里，但并不是去领导生产，而是忙于动员民工。他们在其他村里并没有发现和解决什么问题，对其他村的具体情况也不大了解。由于忽视了对“面”的领导，点和面的工作相差很远。例如在推广泥水选种法时，第二村群众普遍采用了这种先进的方法；但和第二村相邻的第一村，有些群众只知道“泥水选种好”，却不知道究竟该怎样去作。在赶场（赶集）时，别村的群众互相传说：“二村是重点，我们不是重点，差一些不要紧。”工作组也曾组织过“观摩推广”，但事前准备工作不足，收效不大。筹划观摩的干部企图在一次观摩中把一直到秋收为止的办法一次“交代出去”，而不知道观摩是应当在整个生产过程中进行的。群众开始来看了，工作组的干部才找到被观摩的互助组长，临时总结他们的经验和作法，研究讲些什么和怎样讲法。群众三三五五地来了，因为等得不耐烦，又三三五五地走了。到要观摩时，包括被观摩者和工作组几个干部在内，总共不到二十人，冷冷清清地转了一圈，干部又讲了一些脱离群众思想的话，就算“观摩”完毕了，结果，反使一些人对先进经验更加怀疑。
    钻到“点”里的工作组干部看不到周围的情况，对一般村和工作落后村缺乏正确的估计。在宣传新式秧田时，单从二村这个先进村来看“问题不大”，就错误地认为“其他村也可能差不多”，因此就没有在一般村和落后村多加一把力。等到二村种得“差不多了”，干部再到其他村，不少农民已经用老办法种过了。工作组的许多干部到一般村子去，只是“跑来跑去”，找村长、主席开开会，不明白究竟怎样才叫深入，到底应该深入到那里去。
    工作组的干部不十分明白做“点”的工作是要起什么作用，不明白怎样做“点”的工作。他们脱离当地群众的思想和群众原有的耕作技术，去推广外地的先进的生产经验，甚至照搬成套的“科学技术”要群众照办。群众、村干部表面上表示非常“欢迎”，口口声声表示“接受”，实际上却并不相信。他们背后说：“这些读书人，就是嘴会说！我搞了一辈子生产，还不知道怎么做好？”工作组的干部和第一村农会主席谈秧田管理时，这个农会主席很快就说了一套先进经验，表示自己想得很通；但谈到自己如何做时，却找出一堆客观原因，说明自己“今年还不能采用这种方法”。实际上，大部分群众虽然没有实行“标准”的新式秧田，但都已开始改变过去的作法。农民正在克服着几千年来传统的保守思想，采取逐步提高的办法，这是十分合理的。但工作组许多干部却脱离实际地用所谓“标准”、“科学”来要求农民，看不到农民群众的进步。他们看到农民作的“不合规格”，不如自己想的那样“美”，就感到劲头不大。他们既不珍视群众的这些进步，自然也就不能抓住已有的较进步的做法，到一般村去推广。
    工作组还有一个很大的缺点，就是一切包办代替，只顾自己做自己的工作，和乡政府各不相关。他们不注意培养积极分子和骨干，没有充分地把村干部发动起来。这也是点面不能很好地结合起来的一个原因。
    第二村在顺江乡没有起重点村应有的作用，顺江乡在新津县更没有起重点乡应有的作用。中共新津县委在这里设立了重点，派出了工作组以后，是怎样对它进行领导的呢？县委、工作组、乡政府之间为什么好像是互不相关的呢？中共新津县委应该对这些问题认真地加以检查和改进。
