Basic construction projects in Xikang Province have commenced this year. This year, the proportion of investment in industry in Xikang Province's basic construction is relatively large. A new copper mine will be built, a narrow-gauge railway will be laid for the asbestos mine, and workers' dormitories will be built for some mines and factories. In terms of transportation: the bridge piers and deck of the Ya'an Qiangjiang Bridge will continue to be built, the surveying of the 100-kilometer highway from Xichang to Zhaojue, the capital of the Yi Autonomous Region, will be completed, and several bridges will be constructed. In order to vigorously develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings, Xikang Province will also build seven middle schools, two normal schools, as well as hospitals, health centers, and sanatoriums this year. The larger hospitals include the Chronic Disease Sanatorium in Ya'an City, the outpatient department of the General Hospital, the Tuberculosis Sanatorium, and the Leprosy Hospital in Luding (a mixed minority area). Eleven health centers will be built in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, five health centers will be built in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, and two health centers will be built in the mixed ethnic areas of the Xichang area. In addition, in terms of municipal construction, Ya'an City's main projects this year include citizen residences, a Peking Opera theater, and a water supply project. Zhaojue will complete projects such as the People's Cultural Center and the health center this year.

Currently, many projects have started one after another, and more than 4,000 construction workers throughout the province are participating in the construction. On the 24 construction sites under construction in Ya'an City, more than 1,800 construction workers are working hard. Baoxing, Tianquan, Yingjing and other forest areas in Xikang are continuously supplying construction timber to various construction sites in Ya'an City. In Zhaojue, more than 1,000 Han and Yi workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers are actively participating in the construction. They are all building this new city with unparalleled enthusiasm. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army transport wood from the deep mountains and old forests to the construction site.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's construction projects, in addition to the establishment of construction engineering sections in various regions to strengthen the leadership of basic construction projects, the Xikang Provincial People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau first arranged the order of construction of the city's projects based on the urgency of various projects in Ya'an City. And concentrated efforts to tackle the main engineering designs, and drew standard drawings of buildings and bungalows, which were issued to construction units in various counties for reference, so as to partially solve the difficulty of insufficient design strength. Recently, the bureau has also uniformly formulated temporary labor quotas and piecework wage rates for construction projects in Ya'an City, which are implemented on several key construction sites.

    西康省今年的基本建设工程陆续开工
    西康省今年的基本建设工程已经开工。今年西康省的基本建设的投资以工业方面所占的比重较大，要新建一个铜矿，要铺设石棉矿的轻便铁道，部分矿山和工厂要修建工人宿舍。在交通方面：继续进行雅安市羌江大桥的桥墩和桥面工程，完成西昌到彝族自治区首府昭觉长一百公里的公路的勘测工作，并进行若干桥梁的修建工程。为了大力发展文教卫生事业，西康省今年还要修建七所中学，两所师范学校，以及医院、卫生院和疗养院。较大的医院有雅安市的慢性病疗养院、综合医院门诊部、肺结核疗养院、以及泸定（少数民族杂居地区）的麻疯病院。在藏族自治区要修建十一所卫生院，在凉山彝族自治区要修建五所卫生院，在西昌专区各民族杂居的地方要修建两所卫生院。此外在市政建设方面，雅安市今年的主要工程有市民住宅、京剧院、自来水工程。昭觉今年要完成人民文化馆、卫生院等工程。
    目前，许多工程都已陆续动工，全省有四千多名建筑工人参加了建设。在雅安市正在施工的二十四个工地上，有一千八百多名建筑工人正在紧张地劳动着。西康的林区宝兴、天全、荥经等地正在源源不断地给雅安市的各个工地上供应建筑木材。在昭觉，一千多名汉、彝族工人和人民解放军战士积极地参加了建设。他们都以无比的热情来建设着这座新的城市。解放军战士们，从深山老林里把木材运送到工地。
    为了保证今年建筑工程的完成，除了已在各专区设立建筑工程科，加强对基本建设工程的领导外，西康省人民政府建筑工程局首先根据雅安市各项工程需要的缓急，安排了全市工程施工的次序。并且集中力量，突击主要的工程设计，又绘制了楼房和平房工程的标准图，发至各县修建单位，以便参照图样施工，部分解决了设计力量不足的困难。最近，该局又统一制订了雅安市建筑工程临时劳动定额及计件工资单价，在若干重点工地上施行。
