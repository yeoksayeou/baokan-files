    Yumen Oil Mine Exceeds Half-Yearly Plan
    The Yumen Mining Bureau has exceeded its state plan for the first half of the year. In drilling, 104.34 percent was completed; crude oil, 128.20 percent; gasoline, 109.43 percent; and kerosene, 105.98 percent.
    The Yumen Mining Bureau's overfulfillment of its half-year plan is inseparable from the strengthening of planning and management. Since March, they have formulated operation plans based on the planning and management experience of various factories and teams, and organized production according to instruction charts. Another very important reason is the resolute implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts. In drilling, the implementation of the experts' suggestions led to the overfulfillment of the task in May, and in June, rapid drilling was continued, with the monthly plan overfulfilled by 55.95 percent. Among them, the Wang Dengxue Model Drilling Team created a new national record for daily footage.
    Fuxin Vertical Shaft Well Project Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Ping'an vertical shaft well project of the newly built Fuxin Mining Bureau in our country was fully completed on June 23, 67 days ahead of the original plan.
    Ping'an vertical shaft is one of the largest vertical shafts in our country, with a depth of more than 430 meters and a diameter of 6.5 meters. After completion, the coal production will be very large. From coal mining and hoisting to ground transportation, everything is mechanized. Construction began in June last year, and coal production is scheduled for 1955.
    The main reason why this project was completed ahead of schedule is that all employees, under the correct leadership of the Party and the personal guidance of Soviet experts, gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. All employees launched a labor emulation campaign, improved tools, established various responsibility systems, and created a national record of 80.56 meters of progress per month.
    Now, they are intensively carrying out preparatory work to welcome the commencement of the 12-li-long horizontal tunnel project in early August.

    Three New Local State-Owned Factories in Xi'an
    Have Started Production or Are About to Be Put Into Production
    The first batch of three newly built local state-owned factories in Xi'an—Xi'an Paint Factory, Xi'an People's Flour Mill, and Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory—have started production or are about to be put into production.
    The establishment of these factories is aimed at meeting the needs of the people's livelihood in Xi'an or supporting large-scale basic construction. Xi'an Paint Factory started production in late May, and its products include blended paint, spray paint, fish oil, varnish, and more than 50 other varieties, with a maximum daily output of three tons. The raw materials used include tung oil produced in the Zhongnan Mountains in southern Shaanxi Province and kernel seeds and sesame seeds produced in Pingliang and Qingyang areas of Gansu Province. Xi'an People's Flour Mill started production on July 1. The Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory, equipped with nearly 900 looms, will also officially start production in October.    (Xinhua News Agency)
    Xinjiang Province's New October Automobile Repair Factory
    Has Started Production
    The newly built local state-owned October Automobile Repair Factory in Xinjiang Province has officially started production. Xinjiang Province has a vast area, and automobiles are the main means of transportation connecting various parts of the province and the outside world. There are 19 highways in the province, with a total length of more than 7,900 kilometers. The completion of the October Automobile Repair Factory is of great significance to the highway transportation industry in Xinjiang Province.
    The construction work of the October Automobile Repair Factory started in June 1950. The factory has workshops for disassembly, parts manufacturing, accessories, body, assembly, and painting. The machines in the factory's main workshops all use the latest Soviet products. During the construction process, it received enthusiastic assistance from Soviet experts and applied advanced Soviet installation experience. During the two-year construction period, the October Automobile Repair Factory also trained a sufficient number of skilled workers who could master advanced production technology, preparing for formal production.

    State-Owned Sichuan Cement Plant Produces Large Quantities of Cement
    Chongqing State-owned Sichuan Cement Plant produces large quantities of cement to supply the needs of basic construction in various parts of Southwest China. Sichuan Cement Plant is the largest cement plant in Southwest China. This year, 90 percent of the cement needed for the main basic construction projects in the entire region is supplied by this plant. In the first half of this year alone, the plant supplied 10,000 tons of cement needed for the Tiancheng Railway.
    In order to expand production, Sichuan Cement Plant carried out the expansion project of the No. 2 rotary kiln and its auxiliary equipment from the second half of last year to April this year. This rotary kiln began production in May, and its output is equivalent to 75 percent of that of the No. 1 rotary kiln. With the expansion of the new kiln and the exploitation of the potential of the existing machinery and equipment, the plant's planned cement output for the whole year this year is equivalent to 300 percent of the actual output last year. After the new kiln is put into production, the plant's cement output can basically meet the needs of the main basic construction projects in the entire region in the second half of this year, saving a large amount of freight for transporting cement from other regions.

    New Achievements of the Fine Yarn Workshop of Qingdao No. 4 State-Owned Cotton Mill
    The fine yarn workshop of the Qingdao No. 4 State-Owned Cotton Mill has comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan for the first half of this year. The output completed 106 percent of the plan; in terms of quality, the white flower rate was reduced by 8 percent compared with the plan; the weft yarn breakage rate was 0.18 percent, and the warp yarn basically eliminated broken yarns, and the end breakage rate of each yarn count was stabilized below 150.
    The main reason they were able to overfulfill the plan for the first half of the year is that they strengthened planning management and verification work. In strengthening planning management, they particularly strengthened group and individual plans. In the first half of this year, the workers consciously established a system of ordering and checking plans every day. After going to work every day, the workers listened to the opinions of the shift workers, formulated the day's plan, and checked the completion after getting off work. In this way, everyone established the concept of planning.    (Sheng Rongchang)
    Long-Tube Mercury Lamp Successfully Trial-Produced
    Since the large-scale basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the task of sun-printing design drawings has been very large. When sun-printing drawings, long-tube mercury lamps and ordinary mercury lamps are needed. In the past, long-tube mercury lamps were ordered from abroad and were difficult to purchase. Ansteel Design Institute only had one long-tube mercury lamp, and if it broke, it would affect the blueprinting work.
    In January this year, Ansteel ordered goods from Nanjing Electric Lighting Factory. Although Nanjing Electric Lighting Factory had not made long-tube mercury lamps before, in order to support the construction of Ansteel, they finally overcame the difficulties and successfully trial-produced one long-tube mercury lamp and sixteen ordinary mercury lamps for Ansteel. After preliminary trial use, the quality of the mercury lamps is very good.    (Ansteel Design Institute)
    Cangxian Prefectural Construction Company Prepares for Construction
    Striving for Non-Stop Work During the Rainy Season
    Cangxian Prefectural Construction Company of Hebei Province is actively carrying out construction preparations, striving for non-stop work or less stoppage during the rainy season.
    The total annual task of Cangxian Prefectural Construction Company is more than 23,000 square meters. Because the task was approved relatively late, the new project did not start one after another until mid-May, and the vast majority of the projects must be completed by the end of August. Most of the annual task is concentrated in the rainy season of June, July, and August. In order to overcome the obstacles of rainy season construction and ensure on-time completion, Cangxian Prefectural Construction Company first grasped the engineering design work. The company's annual design task is more than 23,000 square meters. After a vigorous assault, as of June 23, 21,239 square meters had been completed, and the remaining design task can be completed in mid-July, which guarantees the timely start of the project. Secondly, the company adopted the following measures: 1. In addition to the main materials and scaffolding boards and scaffolding poles and other main tools, which are transported to the construction site by the Materials Section before the rainy season according to the construction plan, other scattered materials and temporary tools needed should be planned in advance and delivered to the Materials Section to ensure early delivery, avoiding delays until the rainy season due to the inability to transport, resulting in work stoppage, material waiting, and waste of man-hours. 2. Each construction site should try to prepare gray soil in advance to avoid stopping work due to rain filling the trench. 3. In terms of construction, take the approach of doing outdoor work first and then doing indoor work, so as to achieve non-stop work or less stoppage during rain. 4. The material clerks are responsible for strictly doing a good job of material management, especially materials that are afraid of rain, such as cement, hardware, oil felt, doors and windows, must be strictly managed.
    The above measures are being actively implemented at various sites and related departments, and the leadership is conducting in-depth inspections to supervise the implementation of these measures.

    玉门油矿超额完成上半年计划
    玉门矿务局超额完成上半年国家计划。钻井方面完成百分之一百零四点三四；原油完成百分之一百二十八点二零，汽油完成百分之一百零九点四三，煤油完成百分之一百零五点九八。
    玉门矿务局超额完成上半年计划，是和加强计划管理工作分不开的。他们从三月就根据各厂队计划管理经验制定了作业计划，并按指示图表组织生产。另外一个非常重要的原因，就是坚决地执行了苏联专家的建议。在钻井方面，执行了专家的建议，五月份超额完成了任务，六月份又继续实行快速钻进，全月超额百分之五十五点九五完成国家计划。其中王登学模范钻井队创造了全国日进尺的新记录。
    阜新竖井井筒工程提前完工
    我国新建的阜新矿务局平安竖井井筒工程，已在六月二十三日全部完工，比原计划提前了六十七天。
    平安竖井是我国最大竖井之一，深有四百三十余公尺，直径六点五公尺。建成后，产煤量很大。从采煤、提升到地面运输全部是机械化。去年六月开始建设，预定一九五五年出煤。
    这个工程所以能够提前完成，主要是由于全体职工在党的正确领导下和苏联专家的亲自指导下，发挥了积极性和创造性。全体职工开展了劳动竞赛，改进了工具，建立了各种责任制，并创月进八十点五六公尺的全国记录。
    现在，他们正紧张地进行准备工作，以迎接八月初开始建设东西长十二华里的平巷工程。

    西安市新建三个地方国营工厂
    已开工生产或即将投入生产
    西安市第一批新建的三个地方国营工厂——西安市油漆制造厂、西安人民面粉厂、西安棉纺织厂已开工生产或即将投入生产。
    这些工厂的建立，都是以满足西安市人民生活需要或配合大规模基本建设为目的的。西安市油漆制造厂已在五月下旬开工生产，产品有调合漆、喷漆、鱼油、凡立水等五十多种，日产量最高可达到三吨。所用原料一部分是采用陕西省南部终南山所产的桐油，一部分是采用甘肃省平凉、庆阳一带所产的仁子和胡麻。西安人民面粉厂已在七月一日开工生产。装有近九百台布机的西安棉纺织厂也将在十月间正式开工生产。    （新华社）
    新疆省新建十月汽车修配厂
    已开工生产
    新疆省新近建成的地方国营十月汽车修配厂，已正式开工生产。新疆省地区辽阔，汽车是联系省内外各地的主要交通工具。省内有公路十九条，长达七千九百多公里。十月汽车修配厂的建成，对新疆省公路运输事业有重要意义。
    十月汽车修配厂的建厂工作是从一九五零年六月开始的。全厂有拆卸、零件制造、配件、车身、装配、喷漆等车间。厂里主要车间的机器，都采用苏联的最新产品。在建厂过程中，得到了苏联专家的热情帮助，并运用了苏联的先进安装经验。在两年多的建厂期间，十月汽车修配厂还培养出了足量的能够掌握先进生产技术的技术工人，为正式生产做好了准备。    （新华社）
    国营四川水泥厂生产大量水泥
    重庆国营四川水泥厂大量生产水泥，供应西南各地基本建设需要。四川水泥厂是西南地区最大的水泥厂。今年全区主要基本建设工程需要的水泥，有百分之九十都是由该厂供给的。单是今年上半年，该厂供应天成铁路需用的水泥，就有一万吨。
    四川水泥厂为了扩大生产，从去年下半年到今年四月，就进行了第二号旋窑及其附属设备的扩建工程。这个旋窑已于五月份开始生产，它的产量相当于一号旋窑的百分之七十五。随着新窑的扩建和原有机器设备潜力的发挥，该厂今年全年水泥的计划产量已相当于去年实际产量的百分之三百。新窑参加生产后，该厂水泥的产量就可基本上供应今年下半年全区主要基本建设工程的需要，节省了从外区调运水泥的大量运费。        （新华社）
    青岛国棉四厂细纱车间的新成绩
    国营青岛第四棉纺织厂细纱车间，已全面超额完成了今年上半年的生产计划。产量完成计划百分之一百零六；质量方面，白花率较计划降低了百分之八；纬纱坏纱率为百分之零点一八，经纱则基本消灭了坏纱，各支纱断头率稳定在一百五十根以下。
    他们能够超额完成上半年计划的主要原因是，加强了计划管理和查定工作。在加强计划管理中，他们特别是加强了小组和个人计划。在今年上半年度中，工人们自觉地建立了每天订计划和检查计划的制度。工人每天上班后听交班工人的意见，拟订当天的计划，并且在下班后还检查完成的情况。这样，每个人都树立了计划观念。    （盛荣昌）
    长管水银灯试制成功
    鞍山钢铁公司自从大规模基本建设以来，晒印设计图纸任务非常大。在晒印图纸时，需要用长管水银灯和一般的水银灯。长管水银灯过去都为国外订货，很难购买。鞍钢设计处只有一个长管水银灯，如果一坏就要影响晒图工作。
    今年一月，鞍钢向南京电照厂订货。虽然南京电照厂没有作过长管水银灯，可是他们为支援鞍钢的建设，终于克服了困难，试制成功，给鞍钢做了一个长管水银灯和十六个一般水银灯。经初步试用结果，水银灯质量很好。    （鞍钢设计处）
    沧县专区建筑公司准备施工
    争取雨季不停工
    河北省沧县专区建筑公司积极进行施工准备工作，争取雨季不停工或少停工。
    沧县专区建筑公司全年总任务二万三千多平方公尺，由于任务批准较晚，新工程至五月中旬才陆续开工，绝大部分工程又必须于八月底竣工，全年任务绝大部分就都集中在六、七、八月份雨季施工。为了克服雨季施工的障碍，保证按期竣工，沧县专区建筑公司首先抓紧了工程设计工作。该公司全年设计任务二万三千多平方公尺，经大力突击至六月二十三日止已完成二万一千二百三十九平方公尺，其余设计任务七月中旬即可完成，这就保证了工程按期开工。其次，该公司采取了以下措施：一、各现场除主要材料及脚手板、脚手杆等主要工具，由材料科于雨季前按施工计划运到工地外，其它零星材料和临时所需的工具要提前作出计划，交到材料科以便保证提前运到，避免拖到雨季因不能运输而供给不上造成停工待料、窝工浪费的损失。二、各工地尽量提前打好灰土，以免下雨灌槽而停工。三、在施工方面，采取先作屋外活后作屋内活，以便作到下雨不停工或少停工。四、责成材料员严格作好材料保管工作，特别是水泥、五金、油毡、门窗等怕雨淋的材料必须严加保管。
    以上措施各现场及有关科正积极贯彻执行，领导方面正深入检查，监督这一措施的实施。
