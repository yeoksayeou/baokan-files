Zhang Xide's Mutual Aid Team Advances Steadily and Realistically
By our correspondent Gu Weijin

    Zhang Xide's mutual aid team in Wang Village, District One, Quwo County, Shanxi Province, was established in 1951. It started with only three households and expanded to eleven households in 1952. Since they organized, production has increased every year: in the past, the average cotton yield was 30 to 40 catties of ginned cotton per mu, but in 1951 it reached 50 catties, and in 1952 it reached 70 catties. In the past, the average wheat yield was 80 to 90 catties per mu, but in 1951 it reached 120 catties, and in 1952, despite crop reductions due to disasters, it still yielded 90 catties (the average yield for individual farmers at that time was 70 to 80 catties). The production enthusiasm of the whole team is very high. In 1953, they actively improved farming techniques. Cotton began to be planted using seed soaking, seed mixing, and reasonable close planting, and some wheat also began to be planted using close planting and topdressing. All the women in the team participated in production and implemented equal pay for equal work. The success of the mutual aid team is inseparable from Zhang Xide's leadership. Zhang Xide's method of leading the mutual aid team can be summarized in the following words: according to the needs of developing production, from small to large, from low-level to high-level, be realistic and advance steadily.

    From small to large, steady development

    In 1951, the People's Government called for organization, and Zhang Xide, Wang ShengHai, and Li Wenrui organized a temporary mutual aid team. Zhang Xide had farming skills and could unite people, so everyone elected him as the team leader. At first, although they believed that mutual aid was good for production, they didn't quite believe it was as good as the cadres said; one year of mutual aid educated everyone.

    The achievements of organizing were not only an education for the team members but also an encouragement to others. In February 1952, neighbors Guan Zhengchen, Guan Qishan, Wang Youlan, and Wang Deshun requested to join the mutual aid team.

    The leader and members of Zhang Xide's mutual aid team all knew the benefits of expanding the organization for developing production, but they also calmly considered a question: they had only been helping each other for a year, and now suddenly adding four households, could they do a good job? They carefully studied the situation of these four households. Some people said, "Guan Qishan has a strong personality and likes to make suggestions, so it may not be easy to lead him." Others said, "Guan Qishan is upright and his willingness to make suggestions is his strength." Zhang Xide analyzed these opinions and said, "Guan Qishan is straightforward and basically a good person. It's good to make suggestions. If he's right, we'll adopt them; if he's wrong, we'll explain. It's inevitable that there will be shortcomings in the work. Having one more person who is good at making suggestions is good for improving the work." Everyone agreed with Zhang Xide's opinion and approved Guan Qishan's admission to the team. They then studied Guan Zhengchen. He was honest, serious, and responsible in his work, but he was afraid to speak up for fear of offending people. Everyone thought that if he was given more education, his mind would be opened and he would dare to speak up. Everyone also approved Guan Zhengchen's admission to the team. When discussing Wang Youlan and Wang Deshun, everyone felt that these two people were selfish and not easy to get along with; at the same time, they also considered that the old team members only numbered three households, and their mutual aid experience was not yet rich enough, and expanding too quickly might make it difficult to consolidate the mutual aid team, so they decided not to absorb Wang Youlan and Wang Deshun for the time being.

    Zhang Xide's mutual aid team's approach to admitting members was once misunderstood by some people as being "stingy," but Zhang Xide's mutual aid team did not indiscriminately accept members because of this.

    Establish a work point calculation system, carry out criticism and self-criticism

    Some mutual aid teams in Wang Village did not implement work point calculation well, and as a result, everyone often quarreled, was not united, and the mutual aid team could not be consolidated. When Zhang Xide's mutual aid team was first established, it also did not implement work point calculation. Although everyone got along well, there were still some conflicts of interest. Therefore, when the mutual aid team developed from three to five households, they began to establish a work point calculation system. Team member Wang Qifa, talking about the benefits of work point calculation for consolidating the mutual aid team, said, "We have a big ox. In the past, when we helped each other with people, they always made it do heavy work, but the work points were the same as for a small ox, and the accounting was also sloppy. We couldn't stand this loss and ran to several teams. Since coming to this team, it feels different. The team implements fixed division and active evaluation, and timely accounting. We often think that if you can be so serious about calculating work points, we wouldn't want to leave the team even if you asked us to."

    After the implementation of work point calculation, the problems caused by unequal value and mutual benefit were reduced, but due to some people's partiality in their work, many problems also occurred. The team strengthened the team members' studies to improve their awareness, and on the basis of the team members' awareness, carried out criticism and self-criticism.

    For example, Guan Shangde was often biased when doing work for others. Once, Liu Haiquan was sick and unable to go to the field, and Guan Shangde plowed his cotton field very shallowly. The person harrowing the field saw this phenomenon and criticized Guan Shangde for not treating work for others and work for himself the same way. At first, Guan Shangde still defended himself, saying that his ox was small and there was no way to plow the field deeply. Everyone understood that Guan Shangde was being petty and frankly revealed, "It's not that the ox is small, it's that you want to earn more points." Guan Shangde had nothing to say and admitted his mistake. Zhang Xide said, "There are many problems like this, but every time a problem occurs, we carry out criticism and self-criticism, and the problem disappears, and the mutual aid team is consolidated."

    According to production needs, develop and improve in a timely manner

    A year and a half after its establishment, Zhang Xide's mutual aid team had developed from a temporary mutual aid team to a long-term mutual aid team.

    One evening in the autumn of 1952, the mutual aid team cleared a month's work accounts. Team member Li Wenrui suddenly talked about something: he was sick when harvesting cotton. During this busy farming season, it was difficult to hire people to help harvest cotton, but if he didn't hire people to help, delaying the harvest would affect the year's harvest. The team members understood Li Wenrui's thinking. In order not to affect his illness, everyone timely harvested his cotton. Li Wenrui said, "When I think of this, I think that we are still a temporary mutual aid team, and we are so helpful. If we were a long-term mutual aid team, wouldn't it be even more helpful for doing a good job in production?"

    Li Wenrui's proposal of a long-term mutual aid problem aroused everyone's attention. Everyone discussed it enthusiastically. In summary: although they had helped each other for more than a year, but because it was temporary mutual aid, everyone had the idea of "doing it for a while," if they implemented long-term mutual aid, everyone would have long-term plans for their work, and would work even harder. Finally, everyone unanimously felt: "In order to unleash production potential and increase production, we should implement long-term mutual aid."

    Unaffected by rashness and impatience, advance steadily

    In the village, people often called Zhang Xide's mutual aid team "practical team (i.e., seeking truth from facts)" and "steady team (i.e., advancing steadily)." This title is appropriate.

    In the winter of 1952, in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in this area, the tendency of rashness and impatience was serious. In the district's agricultural training class, cadres blindly called for livestock and farm tools to be priced and join the team or join the cooperative, increasing socialist factors, regardless of the specific conditions of the mutual aid team and cooperative. Many teams and cooperatives responded to the cadres' call and were praised. At this time, Zhang Xide's mutual aid team did not respond to the cadres' call. Some cadres were surprised and said, "Your team has always performed well. Why are you now slackening your efforts? You must stand the test." Some young team members couldn't hold back and repeatedly suggested to Zhang Xide, "Our team can't fall behind. Let's also price our livestock to join the team and transfer to the cooperative in half a year. As long as we are wholeheartedly devoted and eliminate selfishness, we will reach that path." However, Zhang Xide and some team members did not say anything.

    "Why were we able to stay so calm?" Zhang Xide recalled the situation at the time, "We thought that in the year or so since the establishment of the mutual aid team, no matter what we did—such as admitting team members, implementing work point calculation, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and transitioning from temporary mutual aid to long-term mutual aid—we were taking one step at a time. Now, long-term mutual aid has just begun, and we are going to 'price livestock to join the team and transfer to the cooperative in half a year.' If we go so fast, can we go well?"

    After the agricultural training class ended, Zhang Xide led the entire team to overcome some team members' rash and impatient thinking based on the past practice of steady advancement.

    They first observed the situation of some mutual aid teams after transferring to the cooperative. Wang Liancheng's mutual aid team in this village was a temporary team, and it did not meet the conditions for transferring to the cooperative, so it reluctantly transferred to the cooperative, pricing livestock and farm tools to be turned over to the public. Because the debt was too heavy, many team members disagreed. As a result, the transfer to the cooperative was unsuccessful. They then analyzed the situation of their own team. Although the entire team had developed to eleven households, most of them were new team members. Although they knew that mutual aid could increase production, they would not be able to see the details until the grain was harvested. At present, they only want to do a good job in the mutual aid team; they have not considered transferring from the team to the cooperative. This is one. Secondly, the economic situation of some team members is not very good, and some people still have outstanding debts. If they implement pricing livestock and farm tools to join the team, these team members will not be able to afford it. According to all aspects of the situation, the entire team unanimously felt that they should not be rash and impatient, but should continue to do a good job in the mutual aid team, improve technology, and increase production. In the future, when everyone has the demand for expanding public property and transferring to the cooperative, they will naturally transfer to the cooperative.

    实事求是稳步前进的张希德互助组
    本报记者　古维进
    山西省曲沃县一区王村张希德互助组，是一九五一年成立的，开始成立时只有三户，一九五二年发展到了十一户。他们自从组织起来后，生产年年提高：过去每亩棉花平均产皮棉三、四十斤，一九五一年就产到五十斤，一九五二年更产到七十斤。过去每亩小麦平均产八、九十斤，一九五一年就产到一百二十斤，一九五二年虽因灾害减产但仍有九十斤（当时单干农民的平均产量是七、八十斤）。全组的生产情绪很高。一九五三年更积极提高耕作技术。棉花开始实行了浸种、拌种、合理密植，有些小麦也开始实行了密植和上追肥。全组妇女都参加生产，实行了同工同酬。互助组能有这样的成绩和张希德的领导是分不开的。张希德领导互助组的方法可以总括为下面几句话：根据发展生产的需要，从小到大，从低级到高级，实事求是，稳步前进。
    从小到大，稳步发展
    一九五一年人民政府号召组织起来，张希德、王生海、李文瑞三户便组织了一个临时互助组。张希德种庄稼有技术，能团结人，大家选他为组长。开始，他们虽然相信互助对生产有好处，但却不大相信有像干部说的那样好；互助了一年，事实教育了大家。
    组织起来的成绩，不仅对组员是一个教育，对旁人也是一种鼓舞。一九五二年二月，邻居关正臣、关其善、王友兰、王德顺四户要求参加互助组。
    张希德互助组的组长和组员都知道，扩大组织对发展生产的好处，但是，他们也冷静地考虑一个问题：他们三户才互助了一年，现在一下子增加四户，能否搞得好？他们把这四户的情况进行了仔细的研究。有的人说：“关其善个性强，好提意见，恐怕不容易领导。”有的人说：“关其善为人耿直，好提意见正是他的长处。”张希德根据这些意见加以分析说：“关其善性子直，基本上是个好人。好提意见也是好的，说的对了，就采纳，不对，就解释。工作上难免有缺点，多一个好提意见的人，对改进工作有好处。”大家都同意张希德的意见，通过吸收关其善入组。他们又研究关正臣。他为人忠厚，做活认真负责，但是不大敢说话，害怕得罪人。大家认为多给他教育，脑筋开了，就敢说话。大家也通过吸收关正臣入组。讨论到王友兰和王德顺时，大家感到这两个人的自私心大，不容易相处；同时也考虑到老组员才三户，互助经验也还不够丰富，扩大太快了，恐怕互助组不容易巩固，于是就决定暂时不吸收王友兰和王德顺二户。
    张希德互助组这种吸收组员的作法，曾经被一些人误认为“小气”，但是，张希德互助组并不因此就滥收组员。
    建立评工算账制度，开展批评和自我批评
    王村有些互助组都没有很好实行评工算账，结果，大家经常吵架，不团结，互助组不能巩固。张希德互助组开始成立的时候，也没有实行评工算账，虽然大家相处还很融洽，但有时也不免发生一些利害冲突。因此在互助组从三户发展到五户时，他们就开始建立了评工算账制度。组员王启发谈到评工算账对巩固互助组的好处时说：“咱有一头大牛，以前和人互助，人家老是让它干重活，评工却和小牛一样，算账也马马虎虎。咱不能吃这个亏，跑了好几个组。自从来到这个组感觉就不一样。组里实行死分活评，及时算账。咱常想，能够这样认真评工算账，你就叫咱出组咱也不想出了。”
    实行评工算账后，由不等价、互利所发生的问题是减少了，但是，由于有些人做活有偏心，也发生了不少问题。组里一方面加强组员们的学习，提高组员的觉悟，一方面又在组员觉悟的基础上，开展了批评与自我批评。
    例如关尚德给人做活时，常有偏心。有一次刘海全生病不能上地，关尚德把他的棉花地犁得很浅。耙地的人看到了这种现象，就批评关尚德不应该把做别人的活和做自己的活两样看待。开始关尚德还分辩，说自己的牛小，没有办法把地犁深。大家了解关尚德耍小心眼，就不客气地揭露说：“不是牛小，是你想多挣分。”关尚德没有话说，承认了自己的错误。张希德说：“像这类的问题是很多的，但是每次发生问题，咱们都开展批评与自我批评，问题就不存在了，互助组也就巩固下来。”
    根据生产需要，及时地发展提高
    张希德互助组成立一年半后，已由临时互助组发展为长期互助组。
    一九五二年秋后一个晚上，互助组清理了一个月的工账。组员李文瑞忽然谈到一件事情：收棉花时，他生病了。在这农忙时节，雇人帮忙收花是困难的，但是不雇人帮忙，花收迟了就要影响一年的收成。组员们了解李文瑞的思想。为了不致使他的疾病受到影响，大家及时地把他的花收下来了。李文瑞说：“咱想起这件事情，就想到咱们这还是个临时互助组，就这样顶事。要是长期互助，不是对搞好生产更有帮助吗？”
    李文瑞提出长期互助问题，引起了大家的注意。大家热烈地讨论起来。归结起来是：过去虽然互助了一年多，但由于是临时性的互助，大家做活都有“干一阵”的思想，如果实行长期互助，大家干活就会有长期打算，干得会更有劲。最后大家一致感到：“为了发挥生产潜力，提高生产，应该实行长期互助。”
    不受急躁冒进的影响，稳步前进
    在村子里，时常听到一些群众称张希德互助组是“实在组（即实事求是）”“稳步组（即稳步前进）”。这个称号是恰当的。
    一九五二年冬季，在这个地区的互助合作运动中，急躁冒进偏向是严重的。在区农业训练班里，干部不顾互助组和合作社的具体条件，盲目号召牲口、农具作价入组、入社，增加社会主义因素。许多组和社都响应干部的号召，得到表扬。这时，张希德互助组没有响应干部的号召，有的干部诧异地说：“你们这个组一贯表现不错，为什么现在松了劲，要经得起考验呵。”组里有些青年组员沉不住气，也向张希德一再提议说：“咱们组不能落后，也来牲口作价入组，半年后转社。只要全心全意，去掉私心，会走到那条道路的。”但是，张希德和一些组员没有吭气。
    “为什么咱们能够这样沉住气呢？”张希德回忆当时的情形说，“咱们想到，互助组成立一年多来，不管干那一件事情——比如吸收组员，实行评工算账，开展批评与自我批评，由临时互助转为长期互助——都是看准一步走一步。现在实行长期互助刚刚开始，就要‘牲口作价入组，半年后转社’，走得这样快，能走好吗？”
    农业训练班结束后，张希德领导全组根据过去稳步前进的作法，克服一些组员的急躁冒进思想。
    他们首先观察有些互助组转社后的情形。本村王连城互助组是临时组，转社不够条件，就勉强转社，把牲口、农具作价归公。因为负债太重，许多组员不同意。结果，转社没有成功。他们又分析本组的情况。全组虽然已经发展到了十一户，但大部分是新组员，他们虽然知道互助能提高生产，但是，还要粮食打下来后才能看出底细。他们现时只是要求搞好互助组；由组转社，还没有考虑。这是一。其次，有些组员的经济情况不大好，有的人还负有外债，如果实行牲口、农具作价入组，这些组员就无力负担。根据各方面情况，全组一致感到不能急躁冒进，应该继续搞好互助组，提高技术，增加生产，将来大家有了扩大公共财产和转社的要求，自然就会转社。
