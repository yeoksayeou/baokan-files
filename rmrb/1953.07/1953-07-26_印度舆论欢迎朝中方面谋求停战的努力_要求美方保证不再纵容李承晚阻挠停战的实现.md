Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 25th: Indian newspapers welcome the sincere efforts made by the Korean and Chinese sides to seek an early realization of a ceasefire in Korea, and condemn the United States for indulging Syngman Rhee in undermining the ceasefire. "New Century" wrote: "The Indian people are very pleased to hear that the Korean War may end in a few days. Peace is coming soon thanks to the tolerance and love of peace on the part of the Korean and Chinese sides."

"National Herald" wrote, "For this improvement in the situation, the people of the world must thank China and North Korea, because they have clearly not abandoned their goal of achieving peace in Korea because of Dulles' arrogant broadcast last week."

A July 24th editorial in "New Century" urged people to guard against the danger of Syngman Rhee causing trouble. It wrote: From the actions of the Korean and Chinese sides, "it can now be seen that they are sincere about peace. They hope to save Korea from the terrible destruction that is now taking place there. Therefore, there is no danger that they will violate the agreement." The newspaper pointed out that the danger lies with the U.S. military command, from whose attitude it can be seen that its concessions were made under duress. The newspaper also pointed out that the danger lies with the U.S. puppet Syngman Rhee, who has repeatedly declared that he will oppose Indian troops entering Korea, and he is desperately obstructing the ceasefire. The newspaper said, "The U.S. authorities should now guarantee to India that the Syngman Rhee government will no longer engage in disruptive behavior and that the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will not be obstructed again. This guarantee is very necessary because Syngman Rhee has claimed that he and Walter S. Robertson had an agreement not to allow Indian troops to come to Korea. So far, the U.S. side has not categorically denied this claim by Syngman Rhee. Therefore, under these circumstances, the U.S. authorities have an inescapable responsibility: they must bring Syngman Rhee into line and must guarantee to India that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will be able to carry out its work without obstruction and difficulty."

A July 24th editorial in "The Hindustan Times" urged the United States to strictly control Syngman Rhee, saying, "Putting an end to a war that has lasted for three years is beneficial to all parties, including South Korea: but if they insist on undermining the ceasefire negotiations, they should be firmly told that the Allied forces cannot tolerate such behavior." The newspaper pointed out: "Syngman Rhee's recent tactics are entirely a strategy of blackmail. If he expects the United Nations forces to be unwilling to completely withdraw from Korea and leave South Korea at the mercy of the communists, then he also seems to be risking the danger of the United Nations forces overthrowing him and provoking the United Nations forces, which is equally foolish." The newspaper believes that Syngman Rhee's claim to advance alone to the Yalu River is entirely a bluff. The newspaper said, "For Syngman Rhee (who would have been completely driven out of Korea had it not been for the timely assistance of the United Nations forces), threatening to advance alone to the Yalu River will not scare anyone. If he wants to try this very stupid method after the ceasefire, then he may, in the worst case, reap the consequences." The newspaper concluded: "Although Syngman Rhee's threat to oppose the ceasefire has caused concern throughout the world, such a misguided and selfish person will never be allowed to endanger the hard-won peace."

### 印度舆论欢迎朝中方面谋求停战的努力  要求美方保证不再纵容李承晚阻挠停战的实现

    印度舆论欢迎朝中方面谋求停战的努力
    要求美方保证不再纵容李承晚阻挠停战的实现
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】印度报纸欢迎朝中方面为谋求朝鲜停战早日实现所作的诚意努力，并谴责美国纵容李承晚破坏停战。“新世纪报”写道：“印度人民听说朝鲜战争在几天内就可结束，他们觉得很愉快。由于朝中方面的容忍和对和平的热爱，和平已很快就要来到。”
    “国民先驱报”写道，“对于局势的这一好转，全世界人民必须感谢中国和北朝鲜，因为它们显然没有因为上周杜勒斯的傲慢的广播而离开了他们在朝鲜取得和平的目的。”
    “新世纪报”七月二十四日社论要人们提防李承晚从中捣乱的危险。它写道：从朝中方面的行动中，“现在已可看出，它们对于和平是有诚意的。他们是希望使朝鲜免于遭受现在在那里进行着的可怕的破坏的。因此它们方面是不会有违反协定的危险的”。该报指出，有危险的地方是美军司令部，从它的态度已可看出，它的退让是迫于不得已的。该报又指出，有危险的地方是美国傀儡李承晚，他已一再扬言他将反对印度军队进入朝鲜，他并且拚命阻挠停战。该报说，“美方当局现在应该向印度保证，李承晚政府不会再有捣乱行为，中立国遣返委员会的工作不致再受到阻碍。这种保证非常需要，因为李承晚已经声称他和华尔特·斯·罗伯逊曾经有过协议，不准印度军队到朝鲜来。到目前为止，美方并没有断然否认李承晚的这种说法。因此，在这种情况之下，美方当局具有无可逃避的责任：它必须使李承晚就范，并且必须向印度保证中立国遣返委员会不致遭到阻碍和困难而能进行工作。”
    七月二十四日的“印度斯坦时报”的社论敦促美国方面严格控制李承晚，该报说，“把打了三年之久的战争停下来，对于各方面都有好处，南朝鲜也包括在内：但是假若他们坚持要破坏停战谈判的话，那就应该坚决地告诉他们，联军方面对于这种行为是不能容忍的。”该报指出：“李承晚最近所采取的策略，完全是一种讹诈策略。如果他指望联合国军必然会不愿完全撤出朝鲜而让南朝鲜听任共产党摆布，那么，他似乎也在甘冒联合国军方面赶他下台的危险而挑惹联合国军，这也是同样愚蠢的作法。”该报认为，李承晚扬言要单独向鸭绿江挺进，完全是一种虚张声势。该报说，“对于李承晚来说（要不是联合国军及时的予以援助，他早就完全被赶出朝鲜了），扬言单独向鸭绿江挺进，是吓不倒任何人的。如果他想在停战后试一试这种非常愚蠢的方法，那末他可能在最糟的情况下自食其果。”该报最后说：“虽然李承晚反对停战的威胁已经引起全世界的忧虑，但是绝不会容许这样一个走入歧途的自私自利的人来危害艰难缔造的和平。”
