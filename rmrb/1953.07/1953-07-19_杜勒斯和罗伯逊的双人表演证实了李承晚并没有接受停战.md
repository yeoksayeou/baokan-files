Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 18th, Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reporting: Dulles and Robertson put on a double act in an American television broadcast yesterday, attempting to convince the American people that Syngman Rhee had accepted the armistice, and to shirk the responsibility of the United States for delaying the armistice. This is clearly because the propaganda machine of the U.S. State Department has not been able to deceive the American people, so this behind-the-scenes string-puller had to bring his buddy Robertson on stage.

The performance began with Dulles giving a general overview of the world situation, followed by a question-and-answer session between him and Robertson on Syngman Rhee's attitude towards the Korean armistice.

Dulles asked Robertson: What attitude do you think Syngman Rhee holds towards the future armistice? Robertson's answer revealed the flaw from the start. He began by saying that Syngman Rhee opposed the armistice. He then said a long list of reasons why Syngman Rhee opposed the armistice, and also talked about how his mission to Korea was to make Syngman Rhee believe that the United States and Syngman Rhee were "completely consistent" in the goal of "unifying Korea."

Dulles then asked Robertson: When Robertson left Seoul, what was Syngman Rhee's "final attitude towards the armistice?"

Robertson did not say that Syngman Rhee guaranteed to abide by the armistice agreement. He first beat around the bush, saying that he and Syngman Rhee had reached a very broad agreement, and then vaguely said that because of this agreement, the United Nations Command believed that it "could believe" that Syngman Rhee "would not obstruct the realization of the armistice." People want to ask: Why couldn't Robertson answer directly what Syngman Rhee's final attitude towards the armistice was? The answer can only be because Syngman Rhee simply did not accept the armistice. The United Nations Command believed that Syngman Rhee "would not obstruct the realization of the armistice," which is obviously because the United States and Syngman Rhee reached an agreement, namely: Syngman Rhee would only not obstruct the armistice within ninety days. The serious danger buried in this agreement for the Korean armistice can also be further explained in Robertson's following remarks.

When answering Dulles' question -- what was Syngman Rhee's final attitude towards the political conference after the armistice -- Robertson admitted that an agreement had been reached between him and Syngman Rhee that if the political conference "continues indefinitely," that is to say, if the United States and Syngman Rhee do not achieve their goals, they "will stop the conference." What happens after the suspension? Robertson did not continue. But Robertson had previously said that they would "take all actions required by the situation."

Apparently feeling the growing suspicion of the world about the talks between Robertson and Syngman Rhee, Dulles asked Robertson: Can Syngman Rhee be trusted to fulfill his promises?

In his answer, Robertson admitted: "Naturally, there will be doubts." He asked the United States and Syngman Rhee not to "doubt you and me," but to "work together" like "friends and allies." People do not doubt that the U.S. government and Syngman Rhee are "friends and allies," what people doubt is how the United States guarantees that Syngman Rhee will abide by the Korean armistice agreement. Since Robertson admitted that Syngman Rhee opposed the armistice, then the question of whether Syngman Rhee can be believed to "fulfill his promises" becomes the question.

Dulles and Robertson's double act did not achieve its original purpose, but at least confirmed two things: First, Syngman Rhee did not accept the armistice. There was no mention of Syngman Rhee guaranteeing to abide by the armistice agreement in the conversations between Dulles and Robertson. Second, if the political conference cannot achieve his goal of "unifying Korea" within ninety days, Syngman Rhee will continue the war, which shows that the suspicion of the Korean and Chinese people and world opinion about whether Syngman Rhee accepts the armistice is completely justified. This also shows that it is completely justified for the Korean and Chinese sides to demand that the U.S. side provide concrete guarantees on Syngman Rhee's compliance with the armistice agreement and its related agreements in the past seven days.

### 杜勒斯和罗伯逊的双人表演证实了李承晚并没有接受停战

    杜勒斯和罗伯逊的双人表演证实了李承晚并没有接受停战
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：杜勒斯昨天和罗伯逊在美国的电视广播节目里来了一出双人表演，企图使美国人民相信李承晚已经接受了停战，并推卸美国拖延停战的责任。这显然是因为美国国务院的宣传机器并没有能够欺骗住美国人民，因此这位幕后牵线人只好带着他的伙计罗伯逊粉墨登场了。
    这出戏的演出，先是由杜勒斯综论一番世界形势，然后由他和罗伯逊就李承晚对朝鲜停战的态度问题一问一答。
    杜勒斯问罗伯逊：你认为李承晚对将来的停战持什么态度？罗伯逊的回答一开始就露出了马脚。他开头就说李承晚反对停战。他接着还说了一大串关于李承晚反对停战的理由，还谈到了他去朝鲜的任务是为了使李承晚相信，美国和李承晚在“统一朝鲜”这个目标上“是完全一致的”。
    杜勒斯又问罗伯逊：当罗伯逊离开汉城时，李承晚“对停战的最后态度”如何？
    罗伯逊并没有说李承晚保证遵守停战协定。他先绕了一个圈子，说他和李承晚取得了十分广泛的协议，然后才含糊地说，由于这种协议，联合国军司令部认为：它“可以相信”李承晚“不会阻挠停战的实现”了。人们要问：罗伯逊为什么不能直截了当地答复李承晚对停战的最后态度如何呢？答案只能是因为李承晚根本没有接受停战。联合国军司令部相信李承晚“不会阻挠停战的实现”，这显然是因为美方和李承晚达到了一项协议，即：李承晚只在九十天之内不阻挠停战。这项协议为朝鲜停战所埋伏的严重危险，还可以从罗伯逊下面的谈话中得到进一步的说明。
    罗伯逊在回答杜勒斯的问题——李承晚对停战以后的政治会议的最后态度如何——时，承认他和李承晚之间已经取得协议，如果政治会议“漫无止境地进行下去”，也就是说美国和李承晚达不到他们的目的，他们“就把会议停开”。停开以后怎么办？罗伯逊没有说下去。但是罗伯逊前此曾经说过，他们将“采取局势所需要的一切行动”。
    显然是由于感觉到全世界对罗伯逊和李承晚会谈的日益增长的怀疑，杜勒斯问罗伯逊：是否可以信任李承晚会履行他的保证？
    罗伯逊在回答时承认：“这自然会发生怀疑的。”他要求美国和李承晚不要“你怀疑我，我怀疑你”，而要像“朋友和同盟者”一样“一起工作”。人们并不怀疑美国政府和李承晚是“朋友和同盟者”，人们怀疑的是美国如何保证李承晚遵守朝鲜停战协定。罗伯逊既然承认李承晚反对停战，那末所谓是否可以相信李承晚“履行他的保证”，就成为问题。
    杜勒斯和罗伯逊的这出双人表演，并没有能够达到它原来的目的，反而至少证实了两件事情：第一、李承晚并没有接受停战，从杜勒斯和罗伯逊的谈话中根本没有关于李承晚保证遵守停战协定的话。第二、如果政治会议在九十天之内不能达到他的“统一朝鲜”的目的，李承晚就要继续进行战争，这说明朝中人民和世界舆论怀疑李承晚是否接受停战，是完全有理由的。这也说明朝中方面在过去七天中要求美方就李承晚遵守停战协定及其有关协议提出切实保证，是完全有理由的。
