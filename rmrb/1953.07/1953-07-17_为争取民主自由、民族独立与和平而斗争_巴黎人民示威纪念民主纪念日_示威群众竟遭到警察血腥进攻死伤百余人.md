Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to TASS, Paris, 15th: On July 14th, Paris held the traditional demonstration to commemorate the storming of the Bastille. The demonstration lasted for several hours. Demonstrators marched from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la Nation. There, a temporary platform was set up, on which stood seasoned leaders of the French labor movement, Marcel Cachin, members of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party Waldeck Rochet and Florimond Bonte, a member of the Progressive Republican Union, d'Astier de la Vigerie, Pastor Boegner, and others.

Representatives of various democratic organizations in Paris participated in the demonstration. The slogans of the demonstration were: Strengthen united action, stop the war in Vietnam, release arrested patriots, and defend democratic rights and freedoms. People demanded the immediate convocation of a five-power conference to resolve all outstanding issues. Among the participants in the march was a contingent of French reserve officers and non-commissioned officers, led by General Petit. They demanded that the government maintain the national character of the French army and abandon the attempt to organize a so-called "European Army."

This demonstration showed the French working people's unwavering will to continue their struggle for democratic freedom, national independence, and peace.

During the demonstration, in the Place de la Nation, not far from the platform, the police began to attack a group of demonstrators, resulting in many injuries and deaths.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to TASS, Paris, 15th: During the Paris people's demonstration on July 14th to commemorate the storming of the Bastille, Parisian police and so-called Republican security forces attacked Algerian participants and opened fire on the demonstrators, resulting in seven deaths and one hundred and twenty-six injuries.

"L'Humanité" reported that the working people of Paris strongly protested the bloody attack by the French police. A group of Communist parliamentarians and municipal councilors went to Paris hospitals to visit the injured demonstrators. Many districts of Paris announced the cancellation of traditional July 14th celebrations to protest the police attack.

"L'Humanité" published an editorial saying: "Paris will never forget the demonstration held between the Place de la Bastille and the Place de la Nation on July 14, 1953. Paris will never forget the huge march formed under the slogans of working-class unity and national unity for freedom. The Algerians and Frenchmen who were killed on July 14, the National Day of Democracy, will live forever in people's hearts! To all the injured, to all men and women, young and old, to all those who, regardless of their views, held high the banner of democracy and republican freedom from beginning to end in the demonstration, we express our respect."

"Libération" also strongly condemned the bloody events in Paris on July 14th. "Libération" concluded: "The people will always remember this day, the first time that the killing of people occurred on the anniversary of the great liberation movement of 1789."

    为争取民主自由、民族独立与和平而斗争
    巴黎人民示威纪念民主纪念日
    示威群众竟遭到警察血腥进攻死伤百余人
    【新华社十六日讯】    据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：七月十四日，巴黎举行了传统的纪念攻破巴士底狱的示威游行。示威游行历时数小时。示威者从巴士底广场走到民族广场。那里布置了一个临时讲台，台上站着法国劳工运动久经锻炼的领袖马赛尔·加香、法国共产党中央委员会委员瓦德克·罗歇和弗洛里蒙·邦特、进步共和联盟盟员达斯迪埃·德拉维热里、波斯克牧师和其他的人。
    巴黎各民主组织的代表都参加了这次示威，示威的口号是：加强一致行动、停止越南战争、释放被捕的爱国人士、保卫民主权利和自由。人们要求立刻召开五大国会议以解决一切悬而未决的问题。参加游行的人们中间，有以柏蒂将军为首的法国后备军官与士官的队伍。他们要求政府保持法国军队的国家特性，并放弃组织所谓“欧洲军”的企图。
    这次示威游行表现了法国劳动人民继续为争取民主自由、民族独立与和平而不屈不挠地斗争的意志。
    示威时，在民族广场上离讲台不远的地方，警察开始攻击一群示威者，许多人因此受伤或殉难。
    【新华社十六日讯】    据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：在七月十四日巴黎人民纪念攻破巴士底狱的示威中，巴黎警察和所谓共和国保安队攻击参加示威的阿尔及利亚人，并向示威群众开枪，结果有七人死亡，一百二十六人受伤。
    “人道报”报道说，巴黎劳动人民强烈地抗议法国警察的血腥进攻。一批共产党议员和市政委员到巴黎各医院去慰问受伤的示威者。巴黎许多地区宣布取消传统的七月十四日庆祝会，以抗议警察的进攻。
    “人道报”发表社论说：“巴黎将永不忘记一九五三年七月十四日在巴士底广场和民族广场之间举行的示威。巴黎将永不忘记在工人阶级团结和全国团结以争取自由的口号下所组成的浩大的游行队伍。在七月十四日全国民主纪念日那天被杀害的阿尔及利亚人和法国人将永远活在人们的心里！对所有受伤的人，对所有男的和女的，年轻的和年老的，对所有不分见解而在示威游行中自始至终高举着民主与共和国自由的旗帜的人们，我们都表示敬意。”
    “解放报”也强烈斥责七月十四日巴黎的血腥事件。“解放报”的结语说：“人民将永远记住这一天，这是第一次在伟大的一七八九年解放运动纪念日发生残杀人民的事件。”
