    Preparations for Signing the Armistice Agreement Underway in Panmunjom; The Whole World Watches Whether the U.S. Will Fulfill Its Guarantee
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 21st dispatch] Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: Preparations for signing the armistice agreement are underway today in Panmunjom.
    The meetings at Panmunjom are becoming more frequent. Three staff officer groups held meetings today, and liaison officers also held meetings to finalize administrative details.
    One can see the assistants of one staff officer group examining maps, working in front of "shadow boxes" with glass covers, which are usually used to draw lines on maps. The staff officers must redraw the military demarcation line to make it consistent with the current line of contact, because since Syngman Rhee disrupted the prisoner of war agreement, causing the preparations for signing the armistice agreement to suddenly halt, the line of contact has shifted southward. Another staff officer group is temporarily adjourned, allowing interpreters from both sides to continue working. The interpreters have held very long meetings. In the past, interpreters usually met to proofread drafts of important documents in several languages.
    While staff officers and liaison officers move in and out of the meeting rooms and tents, workers from the Korean-Chinese side are moving the roof of a giant T-shaped prefabricated building, preparing for the signing ceremony to be held inside this building. Construction work continued under electric lights last night until dawn. Near this rudimentary building, a Korean People's Army soldier is driving a bulldozer, compacting the ground for a new roadbed. A new tent has been erected so that three staff officer groups can meet simultaneously.
    Just as the whole world is waiting for the armistice agreement to be signed, Syngman Rhee's spokesmen continue to issue anti-armistice clamors. United Press reported on the 21st: "South Korean senior officials still believe that Syngman Rhee's attitude of agreeing to abide by the armistice agreement is not final." Prior to this, an Associated Press dispatch said that Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, "implied that President Syngman Rhee's government might soon resume its opposition to the armistice." Although the U.S. chief representative has offered assurances that the United Nations Command has "obtained the necessary guarantees from the Republic of Korea government that it will not in any way obstruct the implementation of the draft armistice agreement," it is reported that Syngman Rhee is "considering a public protest" against the guarantees made by Harrison. Pyun Yung-tai told reporters, "We cannot promise to do so now."
    These remarks further prove the importance of the warning raised by General Nam Il: "If the United Nations forces continue this policy of indulgence towards the South Korean government and its army, then both before and after the armistice, the implementation of the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement may continue to be undermined." The people of the world are watching whether the U.S. will fulfill its solemn guarantee to enable the armistice to be signed and realized.

### 签订停战协定的准备工作正在板门店进行  全世界都在注视美方是否履行它的保证

    签订停战协定的准备工作正在板门店进行
    全世界都在注视美方是否履行它的保证
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：签订停战协定的准备工作今天正在板门店进行。
    板门店的会议更加频繁了。三个参谋人员小组在今天举行会议，联络官也举行会议，以制订最后的行政细节。
    可以看到一个参谋人员小组的助手们审视着地图，在通常用来在地图上描线的带有玻璃盖的“影箱”面前进行工作。参谋人员必须重新划定军事分界线，来使它和目前的接触线一致。因为自从李承晚破坏战俘协议使签订停战协定的准备工作突然停顿以来，接触线已向南推移了。另一个参谋人员小组暂时休会，让双方译员继续进行工作。译员们开了很长时间的会议。译员们过去开会通常都是为了校正重要文件的几种语言的稿本。
    在参谋人员与联络官从会议室与各个帐篷进进出出的时候，朝中方面的工人正在搬运一个巨型丁字形活动房屋的屋顶，准备让签字仪式在这所房屋内举行。建筑工作昨夜在电灯光下继续到黎明。在这个粗具规模的建筑物附近，一个朝鲜人民军战士驾驶着一架开路机，在为一条新的公路压地基。一座新的篷帐已经架起来了，因此，三个参谋人员小组能够同时开会。
    正当全世界都在等待签订停战协定的时候，李承晚的发言人继续发出反对停战的叫嚣。合众社二十一日报道：“韩国高级官员仍然认为李承晚同意遵守停战协定的态度并不是最后的态度”。在这以前，美联社的一篇电讯说，李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰“暗示，李承晚总统的政府不久就可能（对停战）重新采取反对态度”。虽然美方首席代表已经提出保证说，联合国军司令部已“从大韩民国政府获得必要的保证，即：它将不以任何方式阻挠停战协定草案条款的实施”，但据报道，李承晚正在“考虑公开抗议”哈利逊所提出的保证。卞荣泰对记者说：“我们现在不能答应这样做”。
    这些言论更加证明了南日将军所提出的警告的重要性：“如果联合国军对南朝鲜政府及其军队的这种纵容政策继续下去，则不论在停战前后，朝鲜停战协定条款的实施均有继续遭受破坏的可能。”世界人民都在注视着美方是否履行它的庄严保证使停战得以签订和实现。
