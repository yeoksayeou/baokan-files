    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th: Agricultural workers in the southern regions of the Soviet Union are actively engaged in harvesting grain. The harvesting work began first in Central Asia and the South Caucasus, then expanded to the Stavropol, Kuban, Astrakhan, Stalingrad, and Rostov regions, and later to Crimea, Moldova, and southern Ukraine. Now, harvesting has also begun in western Ukraine. Soon, the Volga River region, the Central Black Earth Belt, and southwestern Siberia will also begin harvesting. As of July 10th, the grain harvested by collective farms and state farms in various regions had reached three times that of the same period last year. In the five days from July 5th to 10th, grain was harvested and threshed on a total of over two million hectares (one hectare equals fifteen mu) of land. News from all over the country proves that this year's grain yield per unit area is very high. For example, the Kuban Stalin State Farm harvested 3,300 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare in a vast area. Collective farms in the southern states of Ukraine have achieved a bumper harvest. For example, in the Kherson region, tens of thousands of hectares of land yielded 2.5 to 2.8 tons of wheat per hectare.

    Soviet agricultural workers have fully utilized their production enthusiasm and the effectiveness of agricultural machinery in the grain harvesting campaign, achieving great success. This year, the grain in various regions is growing particularly tall. In some places, the height of the grain exceeds one and a half meters. Therefore, the grain is prone to lodging, increasing the difficulty of harvesting. Under these circumstances, Soviet agricultural workers launched a socialist emulation drive to better use combine harvesters and strive to harvest grain in a timely and lossless manner, so as to ensure the completion of the state's grain procurement tasks on schedule. This year, in addition to working according to hourly work schedules, combine operators have also widely adopted the method of several combine harvesters working together, created by Kuban combine operators. In the past, each combine operator worked alone. The new, more effective method requires three to six combine operators to work in the same field. This ensures better use of machinery to complete the harvesting tasks. Combine operators at the Kum and Azgir Machine Tractor Stations in the Stavropol Territory completed the harvesting of barley and wheat on the collective farm fields, averaging 26.4 hectares of grain harvested per machine per day. Socialist Labor Hero Maltsev of the Konstantinov Machine Tractor Station harvested 1.5 million kilograms of grain from 750 hectares of land in twenty days. Socialist Labor Hero Potochilov of the Yakin Machine Tractor Station in the Nikolaev region used the "Stalin-6" combine harvester to work on 550 hectares of land, harvesting 22 to 24 hectares of grain per day, threshing 2,600 to 2,800 kilograms of wheat per hectare. In most collective farms in Kuban, grain is transported to the threshing floor for cleaning and storage on the same day it is harvested from the combine. All threshing floors in Kuban's collective farms and state farms hardly use manual labor in the weighing, grading, and transfer of grain. Kuban's agricultural workers have now launched a campaign to complete the state plan for grain delivery in July. As of the 12th, Kuban's collective farms and state farms had delivered 6.8 million poods of grain to the state (one pood equals 32.76 jin).

### 苏联南部地区展开收割谷物工作

    苏联南部地区展开收割谷物工作
    【新华社莫斯科十七日电】苏联南部地区的农业劳动者正在积极展开收割谷物的工作。收割工作首先开始于中央亚细亚和南高加索，接着就扩展到了斯塔夫罗波尔、库班、阿斯特拉罕、斯大林格勒和罗斯托夫等州，后来又向克里米亚、摩尔达维亚和乌克兰南部发展。现在，乌克兰西部也已开始收割了。不久，伏尔加河流域、中央黑土地带和西伯利亚西南部也将开始收割。截至七月十日为止，各地集体农庄和国营农场所收割的谷物，已达到了去年同期的三倍。在七月五日到十日的五天中，总共在两百万公顷（每公顷合十五亩）以上的土地上收割并打下了谷物。从全国各地传来的消息证明，今年谷物的单位面积产量很高。例如，库班斯大林国营农场在广大的地区上每公顷收到三千三百公斤的冬小麦。乌克兰南部各州的集体农庄获得了丰收。例如，刻松州有几万公顷面积的土地每公顷收到了二点五吨到二点八吨小麦。
    苏联农业劳动者在谷物收割运动中充分发挥了生产积极性和农业机器的效能，获得了很大的成就。今年各地的谷物长得特别高。有些地方的谷物的高度超过了一公尺半。因此，谷物便容易倒伏，增加收割的困难。在这种情况下，苏联农业劳动者便展开了社会主义竞赛，更好地使用收割联合机，争取及时无损失地收割谷物，以保证按期完成国家采购粮食的任务。今年，收割机手除了按小时工作进度表进行工作外，还广泛地采用库班收割机手创造的几台收割机一同工作的方法。过去，每个收割机手是单独工作的。新的更有效的方法要求三个到六个收割机手在同一块地段工作。这样便能够保证更好地使用机器来完成收割任务。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区库姆和阿兹吉尔机器拖拉机站的收割机手，在集体农庄田地上完成了大麦和小麦的收割工作，平均每天每台机器收割二十六点四公顷的谷物。康斯坦丁诺夫机器拖拉机站的社会主义劳动英雄马尔泽夫，在二十天内从七百五十公顷的田地上收割了一百五十万公斤谷物。尼古拉耶夫州雅金机器拖拉机站社会主义劳动英雄波托奇洛夫，用“斯大林——六”式收割联合机在五百五十公顷的田地上工作，每天收割了二十二到二十四公顷谷物，每公顷打了二千六百到二千八百公斤的小麦。在库班的大多数集体农庄，谷物在从收割机收下的同一天，就运到打谷场去清理和入仓。库班的集体农庄和国营农场的所有打谷场，在谷物的过秤、分级和转运方面几乎都不用手工。库班的农业劳动者现在已展开了争取在七月内完成交纳粮食的国家计划。截至十二日为止，库班集体农庄和国营农场已缴给国家六百八十万普特的谷物（一普特合三二点七六市斤）。
