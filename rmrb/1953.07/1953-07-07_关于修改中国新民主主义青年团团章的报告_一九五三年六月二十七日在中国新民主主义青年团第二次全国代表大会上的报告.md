Comrades, Friends:

It has been more than four years since the founding of the China New Democratic Youth League. These four years have been four years of tremendous changes in our great motherland. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have fundamentally overthrown the criminal rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, established and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, victoriously carried out the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and completed a series of democratic social reforms and economic recovery work. Now we have entered a new historical period of the first five-year plan construction.

In the midst of these enormous changes over the past four years, China's youth and their advanced organizations—the China New Democratic Youth League—under the direct leadership of the Party, have actively participated in various tasks of building and defending the motherland, and have constantly tempered and improved themselves in these practical struggles. Today, the China New Democratic Youth League has become a fighting organization with more than 380,000 branches and 9 million members. The China New Democratic Youth League is increasingly strengthening its work among the broad masses of young people, uniting the youth of the whole country more closely around the Chinese Communist Party.

The organizational construction work of the China New Democratic Youth League in the past was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the current League Constitution. The basic principles of the current League Constitution have been and are the basis for our League construction. However, in order to adapt to the developed and changed situation and tasks, and to reflect the new experiences in the League's construction in recent years, we must make necessary revisions to certain aspects of the current League Constitution. Now, on behalf of the First Central Committee of the Youth League, I am making a report to the Congress on the revision of the League Constitution, please examine it.

I. On the Nature and Tasks of the League

The China New Democratic Youth League was established and has grown up under the close care and guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and our great leader Chairman Mao. The Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth, an assistant and reserve force of the Party. For more than four years, we have faithfully and unswervingly abided by the Party's provisions on the nature and tasks of the Youth League, and as a result, we have achieved remarkable success in our practical work.

Since our country's New Democratic Revolution has been victorious, the new historical tasks of gradually realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning from New Democracy to socialism have been put before the people and youth of the whole country. The general outline of the draft revision of the League Constitution accurately stipulates that the youth of our country must "follow the direction pointed out by our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society."

The completion of this new historical task requires us to strengthen the education of young people, constantly improve their level of awareness, and cultivate new moral qualities in young people. This will enable young people to consciously subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the country, tirelessly learn new knowledge and new skills, actively engage in various beneficial labor, happily participate in collective activities, and bravely struggle against all difficulties in practical work. Therefore, it is necessary to include the following in the general outline of the draft revision of the League Constitution: "The Youth League assists the Party in educating young people in the spirit of communism, so that they become a young generation who love the motherland, are loyal to the people, knowledgeable, disciplined, brave, diligent, energetic, and unafraid of any difficulties."

The youth of New China should be patriots and internationalists. Today, the interests of our motherland and the interests of the people of the world are completely consistent. Every achievement we make in building and defending our motherland is closely linked to the victorious struggle to defend world peace. Therefore, the draft revision of the League Constitution clearly stipulates: "The Youth League is loyal to the principles of internationalism, unites with the democratic youth of the world, consolidates the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and defends world peace."

Comrade Stalin taught us: "Ensuring the leadership of the Party is the most important and significant thing in all the work of the Communist Youth League." The Youth League is forever loyal to the Party. It is always an active propagandist and faithful executor of the Party's resolutions and policies. It carries out all its activities in accordance with the Party's policies and guidelines. What the Party says, the Youth League should do. Therefore, the draft revision of the League Constitution clearly stipulates: "The Youth League carries out all its work under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The local organizations of the League accept the guidance and supervision of the Party organizations at the corresponding level."

II. On League Members

Correctly grasping the conditions for youth to join the League is the primary issue in the League's organizational construction.

Who can join the League? The draft revision of the League Constitution stipulates: "Any young man or woman between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five who recognizes the League Constitution, participates in and works in a League organization, implements the League's resolutions, and pays League dues may become a member of the League." According to this provision, young people who apply to join the League, in addition to meeting the age requirements and having their history thoroughly examined, must also abide by the principles stipulated in the League Constitution of supporting the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, recognizing the Chinese Communist Party as the organizer and leader of the Youth League, and being willing to faithfully strive for the gradual industrialization of the country and the gradual transition to a socialist society under the leadership of the Party; and not only verbally supporting these principles, but also actively promoting the realization of these principles through their own practical revolutionary actions, through their active performance in their production, work, or study posts; and must be determined to obey the resolutions of the Party and the League, and actively complete the tasks assigned by the League.

The draft revision of the League Constitution cancels the provisions on the probationary period in the current League Constitution. This should certainly not be understood as a lowering of the conditions for League members. Now the League organization has a national scale, and the vast number of advanced youth have convenient conditions for receiving the League's education and inspection before joining the League. When absorbing youth into the League, careful examination must be made. Those who do not meet the conditions for joining the League should continue to be strengthened with education and should not be absorbed carelessly.

The Youth League is an organization of advanced youth with a certain age limit. It should be regarded as a natural phenomenon for over-age League members to request withdrawal from the League organization. Therefore, the draft revision of the League Constitution makes the following supplementary provision regarding over-age League members: "League members over the age of twenty-five who wish to withdraw from the League may declare their withdrawal to the branch committee." It is incorrect for individual places to require all over-age League members to withdraw from the League, or to give various obstacles when over-age League members request withdrawal, or even to criticize them as ideologically backward.

III. On the Obligations and Rights of League Members

A Youth League member can only be considered a true League member if he or she faithfully fulfills the obligations he or she undertakes to the Party and the League organization. Those who only verbally "recognize the League Constitution" but in fact completely fail to fulfill the obligations of a League member are not worthy of the glorious title of Youth League member.

Youth League members have the obligation to study Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies hard and to propagate them to the masses of young people. Because only in this way is it possible to continuously improve one's political awareness and ideological level, and only in this way is it possible to better unite young people to serve the people.

Youth League members must faithfully carry out the tasks given by the Party and the League organization. When Youth League members accept a task, if they do not understand the task, they should boldly raise their questions and opinions; after accepting the task, they should do their best to overcome difficulties to ensure the completion of the task.

Youth League members must have a patriotic attitude towards labor. In our country, labor is the most glorious thing. Every Youth League member should love labor and be determined to be a model worker. No matter what kind of work they are engaged in in any work post, even if it is a "small" thing, they should regard it as part of the glorious labor of building our great motherland and do it wholeheartedly.

In the great cause of building the motherland, Youth League members must not only have unparalleled enthusiasm and courage, but also practical skills. This requires us to work harder to acquire new knowledge, learn science and technology, improve our culture, and improve our professional skills, combining courage and initiative with learning more knowledge.

Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every Youth League member. As long as the imperialists and their running dogs who hate us exist for one day, we should always raise our revolutionary vigilance. Every Youth League member must strive to exercise their physique, learn military knowledge, and be ready to contribute everything they have to defend our great motherland and defend our happy lives.

Youth League members should have noble communist moral qualities. They should model themselves on abiding by national laws, cherish public property, and maintain revolutionary order. They are willing to correct their mistakes; they can actively and sincerely put forward their criticisms of any shortcomings and mistakes of comrades and leading organs from the perspective of care. They dare to resolutely fight against all acts that violate the interests of the people, and never lose heart even if they encounter some temporary setbacks.

Youth League members must maintain contact with the League organization and the masses of young people at all times. They should strive to become friends and models of young people. They care about the lives of the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and discuss things with the masses. They never put themselves above the masses and proclaim themselves as superiors of the masses. When Youth League members unite the masses of young people to struggle for the realization of the Party's tasks, they regard patient persuasion and education and their own exemplary actions as the most fundamental working methods, and resolutely oppose the use of any coercive methods to carry out work.

The League organization should educate and supervise all League members to strive to fulfill the above-mentioned obligations of League members.

While educating and supervising League members to fulfill their obligations, the League organization must also ensure that the due rights of each League member are not infringed upon. This is an important prerequisite for developing democracy within the League and giving play to the initiative and creativity of League members. The draft revision of the League Constitution stipulates:

"League members have the following rights:

(1) To freely and realistically discuss any work issues of the League at League meetings and in League newspapers and periodicals.
(2) To have the right to elect and be elected within the League.
(3) To criticize any staff members and leading organs of the League at League meetings.
(4) To file appeals, suggestions, and statements to the League's organizations at all levels up to the Central Committee."

IV. On Democratic Centralism within the League

From the day of its birth, the Youth League has taken the Party's long-tested organizational principle—democratic centralism—as the guiding principle for its internal life.

Sound democratic life within the League is an important guarantee for enhancing the initiative and enthusiasm of League members, eliminating shortcomings in work, and consolidating the unity of the League. League organizations at all levels should convene League member meetings, League congresses, and representative meetings in a timely manner, conscientiously report work to the congresses, earnestly summarize work experience, and do a good job in election work, selecting outstanding cadres who are in contact with League members and the masses of young people to leading positions. League committees at all levels should conscientiously establish collective leadership of the League committee system, and must change the phenomenon in which major issues are not discussed by the League committee meeting, but are decided only by the secretary or a few committee members. At the same time, it is necessary to educate League cadres to actively and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism within the League, and to especially value criticism from below. The indifferent attitude or even suppression of criticism by individual League cadres, and the retaliatory behavior against critics, are absolutely not allowed by League discipline and must be resolutely corrected.

Democracy and centralism cannot be separated at any time. We must fully promote democracy under correct leadership; at the same time, we must strengthen the League's centralism on the basis of promoting democracy, consolidate the conscious discipline within the League, and adhere to the principles of individual subordination to the organization, minority subordination to the majority, and lower-level subordination to higher-level. Only in this way can we consolidate the unity of thought and action within the League, unite more closely around the Party, and complete the tasks given by the Party.

V. On the League's Grassroots Organizations

The League's grassroots organizations are the foundation of the League. They are the basic units through which the League directly contacts the broad masses of young people to carry out work.

The League's leading organs at all levels must face the grassroots organizations, promptly understand the situation of the grassroots organizations, summarize the experience of the activities of the grassroots organizations, and provide practical and effective guidance and assistance to the grassroots organizations.

Correctly selecting and cultivating grassroots cadres is an important condition for strengthening grassroots work. The higher-level League committee should provide the necessary training for grassroots cadres, give them practical and effective guidance, and should be considerate of their difficulties. Grassroots cadres who do not leave production should never be treated as cadres who leave production. The phenomenon of grassroots cadres holding too many concurrent posts and attending too many meetings, which still exists in some places, must be resolutely stopped.

Grassroots organizations are established in accordance with production units and work units. All League members in a factory, mine and other enterprise, farm, village, company, government office, school, or street must be incorporated into a unified League grassroots organization—a branch, a general branch, or a League committee.

All grassroots organizations must make all their work serve the central tasks of the Party and the administration of their unit. For example, the grassroots organizations of the League in factories and rural areas should take educating and leading young people to do a good job in production and strive to study as their central work. However, precisely in order to do a good job in the central work, the League's grassroots organizations must also establish their own regular work under the guidance and supervision of the Party committee, such as frequently paying attention to organizing various cultural, entertainment, sports and other activities suitable for the characteristics of young people, and should appropriately meet the various special requirements of young people. Only in this way can we make the work of our grassroots organizations more active, and can we more widely and cordially unite the masses of young people to complete the tasks given by the Party.

When carrying out work, grassroots organizations should be concerned about the overall work situation of the unit. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate in the League Constitution: "The League's grassroots organizations should put forward suggestions on improving the work of the unit in an active and responsible manner." "The Youth League organization should truly become an active propagandist and executor of the Party's resolutions in all units of national construction, especially in places where there are no Party grassroots organizations."

VI. On the Chinese Young Pioneers

The Party entrusts the practical work of leading children's organizations to the Youth League, which is an important responsibility of the League. Since the First National Congress of the Youth League, significant achievements have been made in children's work. The organization of the Young Pioneers has been established in most middle and primary schools across the country; the work and activities of the team are influencing millions of children, and the team organization has become one of the important forces to cooperate with the school to educate children. In order to more accurately reflect the nature and tasks of the Young Pioneers and to adapt to the progressive requirements of the children, it is necessary to change the name of the team to "Chinese Young Pioneers" and add a chapter on "Chinese Young Pioneers Organization" in the League Constitution.

The rapid development of children's organizations makes it even more urgent for the Youth League organization to strengthen its leadership over children's work. League committees at all levels must correctly guide the development of the team according to objective conditions, and often care about and help improve the political and professional level of the counselors, so that the activities of the team are more suitable for the physical and mental development of the children. The activities of the team must focus on the main task of struggling to acquire knowledge.

VII. On the Youth League Organization in the Chinese People's Liberation Army

The Youth League in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers is an important part of the organization of the China New Democratic Youth League. With their patriotic and heroic struggle, they have added glory to the organization of the Youth League. It is necessary to include "Youth League Organization in the Chinese People's Liberation Army" as a chapter in the draft revision of the League Constitution.

Comrades:

The revisions and supplements to the current League Constitution in the draft revision of the League Constitution will certainly play an extremely important role in strengthening the League's construction. We firmly believe that under the close guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, in actively participating in the great cause of building and defending the motherland, the ranks of the China New Democratic Youth League will surely become more and more powerful and stronger, and will surely continue to prove itself with its own practical actions to be worthy of being the loyal sons and daughters of the Party and the motherland, and will forever maintain the glorious title of the League as the Party's closest assistant and reserve force.

Long live our great motherland!

Long live the great and glorious Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese youth, our most respected teacher, Chairman Mao!

    关于修改中国新民主主义青年团团章的报告
    ——一九五三年六月二十七日在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会上的报告
    李昌亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    中国新民主主义青年团从成立到现在，已经四年多了。这四年是我们伟大祖国经历了巨大变化的四年。我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，已经根本推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的罪恶统治，建立并巩固了人民民主专政，胜利地进行了抗美援朝斗争，完成了一系列的社会的民主改革和经济恢复工作，现在已开始进入第一个五年计划建设的新的历史时期。
    在这巨大变化的四年多中间，我国青年及其先进分子的组织——中国新民主主义青年团，在党的直接领导下，积极参加了建设和保卫祖国的各项工作，并在这些实际斗争中不断地锻炼和提高了自己。现在中国新民主主义青年团已经成为拥有三十八万多个支部和九百万团员的战斗组织。中国新民主主义青年团正日益加强在广大青年中的工作，把全国青年更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围。
    中国新民主主义青年团过去的组织建设工作，是依照现行团章的规定进行的。现行团章的基本原则，过去和现在都是我们进行团的建设的依据。但是为了适应已经发展和变化了的形势和任务，并反映近年来团的建设中新的经验，我们须对现行团章的某些方面作必要的修改。现在我代表青年团第一届中央委员会，向大会作关于修改团章的报告，请予审议。
    一、关于团的性质、任务
    中国新民主主义青年团是在中国共产党和我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀教导下建立和成长起来的。青年团是先进青年的群众组织，是党的助手和后备军。四年多以来，我们忠实不渝地遵守了党关于青年团的性质、任务的这一规定，因而在实际工作中获得了显著的成绩。
    由于我国新民主主义革命业已胜利，逐步地实现国家工业化，和逐步地由新民主主义过渡到社会主义的新的历史任务，已经提到全国人民和全国青年的面前，团章修改草案的总则确切地规定了：我国青年必须“遵循我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志指引的方向，为逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗”。
    这个新的历史任务的完成，要求我们加强对青年的教育，不断提高青年的觉悟水平，培养青年的新的道德品质。使青年能够自觉地把个人利益服从国家利益，不倦地学习新的知识和新的技能，积极地从事各种有益的劳动，愉快地参加集体活动，勇敢地和实际工作中的一切困难进行斗争。所以在团章修改草案总则中就必须列入：“青年团协助党以共产主义精神教育青年，使他们成为热爱祖国、忠于人民、有知识、守纪律、勇敢、勤劳、朝气蓬勃、不怕任何困难的年青一代。”
    新中国的青年应当是爱国主义者，又是国际主义者。今天我们祖国的利益和世界人民的利益是完全一致的，我们在建设和保卫祖国中的每一个成就，都是和保卫世界和平的胜利斗争紧密相联的。所以，在团章修改草案中明确地规定：“青年团忠于国际主义原则，联合世界民主青年，巩固以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，保卫世界和平。”
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“保证党的领导是共产主义青年团全部工作中最主要和最重大的事情。”青年团永远忠实于党，它始终是党的决议和政策的积极宣传者和忠实执行者。它根据党的政策和方针来进行自己的全部活动，党是怎样说的，青年团就应该是怎样做的。因此团章修改草案就明确地规定了：“青年团在中国共产党的直接领导下进行全部工作。团的地方组织接受同级党组织的指导与监督。”
    二、关于团员
    正确掌握青年入团条件，是团的组织建设中的首要问题。
    甚么人才可以入团呢？团章修改草案中规定：“凡十四周岁以上，二十五周岁以下的男女青年，承认团章、参加团的一个组织并在其中工作、执行团的决议、缴纳团费者，均得为本团团员。”依据这个规定，要求入团的青年，除年龄必须相符、历史必须审查清楚之外，还必须遵照团章所规定的拥护中国共产党的主张，承认中国共产党是青年团的组织者和领导者，愿意忠实地在党的领导下为国家逐步实现工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗；并且不仅是口头上拥护，还必须经过自己实际的革命行动，经过自己在生产的、工作的或学习的岗位上的积极表现，来积极促进这些原则的实现；必须决心服从党和团的决议，积极完成团所分配的任务。
    团章修改草案取消了现行团章中关于候补期的规定，这当然不应当了解为团员条件的降低。现在团的组织已具有全国的规模，广大先进青年在入团之前，都已有了接受团的教育和考察的便利条件。在吸收青年入团时必须慎重审查，凡不足入团条件者，则应继续加强教育，不要马虎吸收。
    青年团是一个有着一定年龄限制的先进青年的组织，超龄团员提出退出团的组织，应认为是一种自然的现象，因此团章修改草案对关于超龄团员的规定作了如下的补充：“超过二十五岁的团员，凡愿退团者，得向支部委员会声明退团。”个别地方曾经要超龄团员一律退团，或当超龄团员提出退团时，给以种种阻难，甚至批评为思想落后，都是不对的。
    三、关于团员的义务与权利
    一个青年团员，只有忠实履行了自己对党、对团组织所承担的义务，才可算是一个名副其实的团员。那些只在口头上“承认团章”，但实际上却完全不履行团员的义务的人，是和青年团员的光荣称号不相称的。
    青年团员有义务努力学习马克思列宁主义和党的政策，并向青年群众作宣传。因为只有这样，才有可能使自己的政治觉悟和思想水平获得不断的提高，才有可能更好地团结青年为人民服务。
    青年团员必须忠实执行党和团的组织所给予的任务。青年团员在接受任务时，如对任务有所不了解，就应当大胆提出自己的疑问和意见；接受任务后，就应当尽力去克服困难，以保证任务的完成。
    青年团员必须具有爱国主义的劳动态度。在我国劳动是最光荣的。每一个青年团员都应当热爱劳动，并立志作一个模范的劳动者。不管在任何工作岗位上担任着哪一种工作，哪怕是“微小”的事情，都应该把它看作是建设我们伟大祖国光荣的劳动的一部分，而全心全意地去做好它。
    在建设祖国的伟大事业中，青年团员不仅要有无比的热情和勇敢，还要有实际本领，这就要求我们要更加努力地去获取新的知识，学习科学技术，提高文化，提高业务水平，把勇敢、积极性和学习更多的知识结合起来。
    保卫祖国，是每个青年团员的神圣天职，只要当仇视我们的帝国主义及其走狗尚存在一天，我们就应当时刻提高革命警惕性。每个青年团员都必须努力锻炼体格，学习军事知识，随时准备为保卫我们伟大祖国和保卫我们幸福的生活而贡献出自己的一切。
    青年团员应具有高尚的共产主义道德品质，他应当模范地遵守国家法令，爱护公共财产，维护革命秩序。他对于自己的错误勇于改正；他对于任何同志和领导机关的缺点和错误，都能从爱护观点出发，积极地、诚恳地提出自己的批评。他敢于和一切违反人民利益的行为坚决斗争，哪怕遇到一些暂时的挫折，也决不灰心。
    青年团员要每时每刻地维护团组织和青年群众的联系，他应该努力地使自己成为青年的朋友和模范。他关心群众生活，倾听群众意见，有事和群众商量，他绝不把自己置于群众之上，自封为群众的上司。青年团员在团结青年群众为实现党的任务而斗争时，把耐心说服教育和自己的模范行动当做最根本的工作方法，坚决反对以任何强迫命令的方法去进行工作。
    上述各项团员义务，团组织均应教育和监督全体团员努力执行。
    在教育并监督团员履行其义务的同时，团组织还必须保障每个团员的应有权利不被侵犯。这是发扬团内民主，发挥团员积极性与创造性的重要前提。团章修改草案规定：
    “团员有下列权利：
    （一）在团的会议上和团的报刊上，自由地、切实地讨论团的任何工作问题。
    （二）在团内有选举权与被选举权。
    （三）在团的会议上，批评团的任何工作人员及领导机关。
    （四）向团的各级组织直到中央委员会提出申诉、建议和声明。”
    四、关于团内民主集中制
    青年团从它诞生的一天起，就以党的久经考验的组织原则——民主集中制，作为自己内部生活的指导原则。
    健全团内民主生活，是提高团员的积极性和主动性，消除工作中的缺点，巩固团的统一的重要保证。各级团的组织应当适时召开团员大会、团的代表大会和代表会议，认真地向大会报告工作，切实地总结工作经验，并做好选举工作，选拔优秀的联系团员和青年群众的干部到领导岗位上来。各级团委应切实建立起团委制的集体领导，必须改变那种对于重大问题不经过团委会议的讨论，只由书记个人或少数委员决定的现象。同时，要教育团的干部积极地正确地开展团内批评与自我批评，特别要重视自下而上的批评，个别团的干部对于批评采取冷淡态度甚至压制批评对批评者采取打击报复的行为，这是为团纪所绝不容许的，必须坚决予以纠正。
    民主与集中是任何时候也不能分开的。我们必须在正确的领导下充分发扬民主；同时也必须在发扬民主的基础上加强团的集中制，巩固团内自觉的纪律，坚持个人服从组织、少数服从多数、下级服从上级的原则。只有这样，才能巩固团内思想的一致与行动的统一，更加紧密地团结在党的周围，完成党所给予的任务。
    五、关于团的基层组织
    团的基层组织是团的基础，它是团直接联系广大青年群众进行工作的基本单位。
    青年团的各级领导机关，均必须面向基层组织，及时了解基层组织的情况，总结基层组织活动的经验，对基层组织进行实际有效的指导和帮助。
    正确地选择和培养基层干部，是加强基层工作的重要条件。上级团委应对基层干部作必要的训练，给以实际有效的指导，并要体贴他们的困难，决不应把不脱离生产的基层干部也当作脱离生产的干部使用，要坚决停止有些地方还存在着的基层干部兼职过多、开会过多的现象。
    基层组织是按照生产单位和工作单位建立起来的。在一个工厂、矿山及其他企业、农场、乡村、连队、机关、学校、街道中的所有团员，都必须编入一个统一的团的基层组织——支部、总支部或团委会。
    一切基层组织，都必须使自己的全部工作服务于本单位党和行政的中心任务。例如工厂、农村团的基层组织就应该把教育和领导青年搞好生产和努力学习，作为自己的中心工作。但正是为了做好中心工作，团的基层组织还必须在党委的指导和监督下建立自己的经常工作，如经常注意组织适合青年特点的各种文化、娱乐、体育等活动，并应适当地满足青年的各种特殊要求。只有这样，才能使我们基层组织的工作更加活跃，才能使基层组织更广泛而亲切地团结青年群众去完成党所给予的任务。
    基层组织在进行工作时，要关心本单位全面的工作情况。因此团章中有必要规定：“团的基层组织应以积极负责的态度，提出有关改进本单位工作的建议。”“青年团组织应在国家建设所有单位内，特别在没有党的基层组织的地方，真正成为党的决议的积极宣传者与执行者。”
    六、关于中国少年先锋队
    党把领导少年儿童组织的实际工作委托给青年团，这是团的重要职责。从青年团的第一次全国代表大会以来，少年儿童工作已获得显著成绩。少年儿童队的组织，已在全国多数中、小学校中建立起来；队的工作和活动，正在影响着千百万少年儿童，队的组织已成为配合学校教育儿童的重要力量之一。为了更确切地反映少年儿童队的性质、任务，和适应少年儿童们的进步要求，有必要将队的名称改为“中国少年先锋队”，并在团章中增加“中国少年先锋队组织”的一章。
    少年儿童组织的迅速发展，更加迫切地要求青年团组织加强对少年儿童工作的领导。各级团委都必须根据主客观条件，正确地指导队的发展，经常关心和帮助辅导员的政治、业务水平的提高，使队的活动更加适合于少年儿童的身心发展，队的活动必须围绕着为获取知识而斗争的主要任务。
    七、关于中国人民解放军内的青年团组织
    中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军内的青年团，是构成中国新民主主义青年团的组织的一个重要部分。他们以自己爱国主义的英勇斗争，为青年团的组织增添了光辉。团章修改草案中有必要将“中国人民解放军内的青年团组织”列为一章。
    同志们：
    团章修改草案中对于现行团章所作的修改和补充在加强团的建设上必将发挥极为重要的作用。我们深信：在党和毛主席亲切的教导下，在积极参加建设和保卫祖国的伟大事业中，中国新民主主义青年团的队伍，将一定会愈益壮大，变得更加坚强有力，将一定会以自己的实际行动继续证明自己不愧为党和祖国的忠实儿女，将永远保持团是党的最亲密的助手和后备军的光荣称号。
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    伟大的光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民和中国青年的伟大领袖，我们最敬爱的导师毛主席万岁！
