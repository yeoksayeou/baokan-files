Our Great Motherland

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been fully open to traffic for a year. It has played a significant role in developing industrial and agricultural production in the Southwest region, strengthening material exchange, and promoting various basic constructions along the railway. Many coal mines in this area that had ceased production in the past have now resumed production and are gradually expanding. The large piles of coal here have just been transported to Chengdu Station by train.
