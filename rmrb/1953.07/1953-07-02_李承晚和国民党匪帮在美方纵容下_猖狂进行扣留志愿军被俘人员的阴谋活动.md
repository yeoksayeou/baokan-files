Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st dispatch: A special correspondent of this agency reports: The conspiracy to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, jointly planned by Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang gang with the connivance of the US side, is being stepped up.

　　This conspiracy was arranged long ago. According to Agence France-Presse, on May 14, one day after the US side put forward a "counter-proposal" in Panmunjom, the Kuomintang gang submitted a note to the US ambassador stationed with the Kuomintang gang, Rankin, expressing opposition to the clauses in the US "counter-proposal" regarding the establishment of a neutral nations repatriation commission. On May 17, Chiang Kai-shek gave a written statement to a reporter from the US International News Service, openly demanding that the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were not directly repatriated be handed over to him. Subsequently, close contact was made between the Syngman Rhee gang and the Kuomintang gang, apparently to jointly formulate a plan to forcibly detain Chinese prisoners of war. There are reports that the Kuomintang gang has even prepared transportation to transport the detained prisoners of war to Taiwan.

　　At the same time, the Kuomintang gang, through its agents in the prisoner-of-war camps, stepped up the persecution of the prisoners of war. These Kuomintang agents also forced the prisoners of war to affix blood fingerprints to a so-called "petition" to Syngman Rhee, demanding that Syngman Rhee "release" them. According to a United Press International report from Seoul on June 29, this "petition" was completed exactly one day before Syngman Rhee's large-scale detention of prisoners of war. From this, the collusion between Syngman Rhee and the Chiang Kai-shek gang can be clearly seen.

　　After Syngman Rhee began his action of forcibly detaining large numbers of captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, the Kuomintang gang, on the one hand, created so-called "demonstrations" demanding "release" in the prisoner-of-war camps on Jeju Island, and on the other hand, with the assistance of Syngman Rhee, began to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Seoul on June 22 reported that "in some United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea, non-Communist Chinese prisoners of war have begun to attempt to escape." Many US news agencies have reported such news. A United Press International dispatch from Busan on the 23rd reported that 113 Chinese prisoners of war were taken from a prisoner-of-war hospital near Busan on June 18. United Press reporter Gibson reported on June 23 that on June 20, 107 Chinese prisoners of war were taken away by Syngman Rhee in Busan. An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on June 22 reported that on June 22, about 100 Chinese prisoners of war were forced to leave a prisoner-of-war camp near Busan.

　　Like the attitude towards the Syngman Rhee gang, the US side has also adopted a conniving attitude towards the Kuomintang gang's forced detention of prisoners of war. US news agencies admitted that some prisoner-of-war camps were completely guarded by US soldiers, but they did not interfere in any way when the Chinese prisoners of war were forced to leave the prisoner-of-war camps. At the same time, they did not try to recover these prisoners of war. The Associated Press reported that some of the detained Chinese prisoners of war may be mixed in with the "Chinese merchants" in Busan, which in fact means that they have fallen into the hands of the Kuomintang gang in South Korea. Another part of the Chinese prisoners of war are in the hands of the South Korean police; however, the US side does not recover them from them, and declares that they have "no way" to recover the Chinese prisoners of war.

　　This conniving attitude of the US side has greatly encouraged Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang gang. Syngman Rhee and Wang Dongyuan, the Kuomintang gang's ambassador to South Korea, held frequent talks to discuss how to "release" Chinese prisoners of war. The Kuomintang gang has also submitted a plan to the US government to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Some of the Kuomintang gang's pet organizations have successively demanded that Eisenhower and Syngman Rhee send Chinese prisoners of war to Taiwan. South Korean politicians have also come out to echo the call, demanding the immediate "release" of Chinese prisoners of war. Now, in the prisoner-of-war camps on Jeju Island, Kuomintang agents are again forcing prisoners of war to write "blood letters" to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that they be allowed to go to Taiwan. In the "blood letters," these Kuomintang agents threatened to kill the explanation personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides and the representatives of neutral countries who go to the prisoner-of-war camps after the armistice. The US prisoner-of-war camp authorities not only do not prohibit these agents' rampant activities, but also help them transmit these "blood letters," and the US news agencies widely disseminate them for them.

　　Observers here pointed out that the US side has repeatedly stated that Syngman Rhee's army and the US prisoner-of-war camps are under US control. However, now the US side is not only unwilling to take responsibility for recovering the prisoners of war who have been forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee, but also continues to connive at the Kuomintang agents' mischief in the prisoner-of-war camps, encouraging them to forcibly detain large numbers of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, which has led to the increasingly rampant activities of these factional elements. The Korean and Chinese people are now closely watching the development of this incident.

### 李承晚和国民党匪帮在美方纵容下  猖狂进行扣留志愿军被俘人员的阴谋活动

    李承晚和国民党匪帮在美方纵容下
    猖狂进行扣留志愿军被俘人员的阴谋活动
    【新华社开城一日电】本社特派记者报道：在美方纵容之下，李承晚和国民党匪帮共同策划的强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的阴谋，正在加紧进行。
    这个阴谋是早就布置好了的。据法新社报道，五月十四日，也就是美方在板门店提出“反建议”以后一天，国民党匪帮就向美国驻在国民党匪帮的大使兰金提出一份照会，对美方“反建议”中成立中立国遣返委员会等条款表示反对。五月十七日，蒋匪介石对美国的国际新闻社记者发表书面谈话，公开要求将不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员交给他。接着，李承晚匪帮和国民党匪帮之间进行了密切的接触，显然是为了共同拟订强迫扣留中国战俘的计划。有消息说，国民党匪帮甚至已经准备好了运输工具，以便将被扣留的战俘运往台湾。
    与此同时，国民党匪帮通过它派在战俘营中的特务，加紧迫害战俘。这些国民党特务并且强迫战俘们在一份给李承晚的所谓“请愿书”上盖血指印，要求李承晚“释放”他们。据合众社汉城六月二十九日电报道，这份“请愿书”恰好是在李承晚大批扣留战俘之前一天完成的。从这里也就可以明显地看出李承晚和蒋介石匪帮之间的共谋。
    在李承晚强迫扣留大批朝鲜人民军被俘人员的行动开始以后，国民党匪帮就一方面在济州岛战俘营里制造所谓要求“释放”的“示威”，一方面在李承晚协助下，开始强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员。法新社汉城六月二十二日电报道说，“在南朝鲜的若干联合国军战俘营中，非共产党的中国战俘开始企图逃跑。”许多美国通讯社都报道了这样的消息。合众社釜山二十三日电报道说：有一百一十三名中国战俘在六月十八日被从釜山附近的一个战俘医院里押走。美联社记者吉布逊在六月二十三日报道说，六月二十日，在釜山有一百零七名中国战俘被李承晚押走。美联社汉城六月二十二日电报道说，六月二十二日，在釜山附近的一个战俘营约有一百名中国战俘被强迫离开战俘营。
    像对李承晚匪帮一样，美方对国民党匪帮这种强迫扣留战俘的行为也采取了纵容的态度。美国通讯社承认，有些战俘营是完全由美国士兵看守的，可是他们在中国战俘被迫离开战俘营时，竟然没有加以任何干涉。同时，他们也不设法追回这些战俘。美联社报道说，某些被扣留了的中国战俘可能混在釜山的“中国商人”群中，这实际上就是说，他们已经落入在南朝鲜的国民党匪帮手中。另外一部分中国战俘是在南朝鲜警察手里；可是美方也并不向他们追回，并且宣称他们对于追回中国战俘一事“没有什么办法”。
    美方这种纵容态度，大大鼓励了李承晚和国民党匪帮。李承晚和国民党匪帮驻南朝鲜大使王东原举行了频繁的会谈，商讨如何“释放”中国战俘。国民党匪帮并且向美国政府提出了一个强迫扣留战俘的计划。国民党匪帮的一些御用组织，纷纷向艾森豪威尔、李承晚提出把中国战俘送到台湾去的要求。南朝鲜的政客们也出来帮腔，要求立刻“释放”中国战俘。现在，在济州岛战俘营里，国民党特务们又强迫战俘们写“血书”给李承晚和蒋介石，要求让他们到台湾去。这些国民党特务在“血书”中威胁着要杀死在停战以后到战俘营去的朝中方面的解释人员和中立国的代表。美国战俘营当局不但不禁止这些特务的猖狂活动，反而替他们传递这些“血书”，而美国的通讯社则替他们广为传播。
    此间观察家指出：美方曾经一再声明，李承晚的军队和美方战俘营都是在美方控制之下的。可是现在美方不但不肯负责追回已经被李承晚强迫扣留的战俘，反而继续纵容国民党特务在战俘营中胡作非为，鼓励他们强迫扣留大批中国人民志愿军被俘人员，致使这些特务分子的活动越来越猖狂。朝中人民现在正在密切注视着这一事件的发展。
