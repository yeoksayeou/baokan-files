Welcome to the Indian Art Delegation
Zheng Zhenduo

The Indian Art Delegation has arrived in Beijing, and we should first extend a warm welcome to them! We watched their performance for the first time on the evening of the 23rd; we warmly welcome every program they perform!

Indian art, like Chinese art, has a long history and brilliant achievements; especially in singing and dancing, it has profound training and cultivation. We were deeply impressed by Damayanti Joshi's performance of "Kathak Dance," Chandralekha Patel's performance of "Bharatanatyam Dance," and Qingaradi Gopalakrishnan's performance of the Peacock Dance. The gestures of the hands and the advances and retreats of the feet all express an emotion, have a specific meaning, and conform to the rhythm of poetry. It is not easy to reach such a beautiful realm without many years of hard work.

Indian songs are particularly beautiful in their melodious and winding nature. When we listened to "Mother! We Salute You," we felt the Indian people's warm patriotic sentiments. The "Peace Song" is strong and represents the new strength of the Indian people in defending peace. Many classical songs and folk songs all show vitality and life in their tones. The delegation sang Tagore's poems in the original Bengali, which made the singing even more beautiful and full of inflections. Many of his poems, dramas, and novels have been translated into Chinese. I myself have translated his "Stray Birds" and "The Crescent Moon," but unfortunately, they were translated from English, which must have lost many of the original Bengali's advantages.

Although we couldn't understand the lyrics of Mrs. Shilape Barodekar's classical Marathi solo, we seemed to be able to comprehend the girl's joyful mood when drawing water. Plam Burikal's classical solo showed the male's melancholy and heroic spirit. All of these remind us of the feelings we had when we were young, reciting "The Ballad of Mulan," Du Fu's "Three Officials" and "Three Separations," Li Bai's "The Road to Shu is Hard," and Bai Juyi's "The New Arm of the Old Man of Xinfeng." Although we don't have accompanying instruments, our love for classical songs and our understanding of the pleasing and rhythmic syllables are the same.

Maduka Manohar Gorwarkar's "Tabla-Shehnai" solo shocked our hearts. "Tabla-Shehnai" are two "drum"-like instruments. The fingers and palms strike them with varying speeds, and one of the "drums" is very similar to the "羯鼓" that was popular in our Tang Dynasty. There may be a "connection" between them.

Valayat Hussaini Khan's "Sitar" solo was widely welcomed. The "Sitar" is a stringed instrument with more than 20 strings and endless variations in tone. Many of our musicians in attendance paid close attention to this instrument.

Finally, there was the "Kathakali Dance," which is a story dance taken from the great Indian epic "Mahabharata."
	"Mahabharata" is India's, and the world's, longest epic, divided into eighteen chapters, containing more than 200,000 lines of verse, which is eight times the combined length of the two great Greek epics "Iliad" and "Odyssey." The story of "Mahabharata" is well known in India. Many dramas and songs are based on this great epic. According to legend, the author of this great epic is Vyasa, the compiler of the "Vedas." It is not only famous for its unusually vast chapters, but also a treasure trove of the beautiful imagination and legends of the ancient Indian people, and the life and thoughts of the people. The simple story is like this: Hatred grew between the Pandavas and the Kurus. Duryodhana of the Kurus won the land of the Pandavas through gambling, and the Arjuna brothers of the Pandavas were sentenced to live in seclusion in the forest for twelve years. After the exile period passed, the Pandavas demanded the land back from the Kurus, but Duryodhana stubbornly refused to return it. A great war broke out between the two clans. It was a bloody and terrifying war that lasted until the eighteenth day. Victory went to the Pandavas. Lord Krishna helped Arjuna of the Pandavas. The decisive battle between Arjuna and his enemy Karna was an earth-shattering struggle. Arjuna finally killed Karna. Finally, Duryodhana was also killed.
	In this "Kathakali Dance," it is only mentioned how Lord Krishna helped the Pandavas and how Duryodhana was killed.

We also saw this kind of "Kathakali Dance" in a place in South India when we visited India the year before last. At that time, we were very surprised that it was very similar to the martial arts dramas in our Peking Opera, with Jing characters as the protagonists. (At that time, we watched a story dance from another great Indian epic, "Ramayana.") With gongs and drums playing together, martial generals with painted faces were fighting in a decisive battle. Except that the songs of the "Kathakali Dance" were sung by singers, everything was very similar.

The friendship between the people of China and India is long and profound, and the cultures and arts of China and India have thousands of links.

The "Kathakali Dance" was performed by the dance troupe of the poet Valathol Narayana Menon. He himself also came this time. He is full of enthusiasm for China. When the Chinese cultural delegation visited India, he wrote to invite us to his place, to the art school he runs. Unfortunately, we couldn't make it. Two years later, we finally met him in Beijing and saw the artists led by him who performed the "Kathakali Dance," which made us particularly excited.

Best wishes for the success of the Indian Art Delegation! (Attached pictures)

### 欢迎印度艺术代表团

    欢迎印度艺术代表团
    郑振铎
    印度艺术代表团来到了北京，我们首先应向他们表示热烈的欢迎！我们在二十三日晚间第一次看到他们的演出；我们热烈的欢迎他们每一个演出的节目！
    印度的艺术，和中国的艺术同样的有悠久的历史和光辉的成就；特别在歌唱和舞蹈方面，有其深湛的训练和修养。我们看到达玛扬蒂·乔希表演的“卡达客舞”，钱德拉莱卡·巴特尔表演的“巴拉纳殿扬舞”，秦加拉迪·戈帕拉克里希南表演的孔雀舞，印象是很深刻的。手的姿势，足的进退，都表现一种情感，具有特定的意义，合于诗的韵律，非下过多年苦工夫，是不容易达到这样优美的境界的。
    印度的歌曲，特别令人感到悠扬、婉曲的美。我们听了“母亲！我们向你致敬”，感到印度人民的热烈的爱国情绪。“和平歌”是壮健的，表示着印度人民的保卫和平的新生的力量。许多古典歌曲、民间歌曲，都显得在音调里充沛着活力和生命。代表团用彭加利原文唱出泰戈尔的诗，更显得歌声美丽而尽抑扬曲折之致。他的诗歌、戏曲、小说译成中文的不少。我自己就译过他的“飞鸟集”和“新月集”，可惜是从英文本译出的，必定失掉不少原来彭加利文的好处。
    希拉培·巴罗德卡尔夫人的古典歌曲马拉提小调独唱，我们虽然听不懂歌辞，也仿佛能够领会到那个女孩子在汲水时的愉快的心情。普拉姆布里卡尔的古典歌曲独唱，则表现了男性的沉郁而雄壮的气概。这些，都使我们想到少年时代朗诵“木兰辞”、杜甫的“三吏”“三别”、李白的“蜀道难”、白居易的“新丰折臂翁”的情形，我们虽然没有伴奏的乐器，但对于古典歌曲爱好的心情与对于铿锵可喜的音节的领会是同样的。
    马杜卡·马诺哈尔·戈尔瓦尔卡的“塔—萨那依”独奏，震撼着我们的心。“塔—萨那依”是两种“鼓”似的乐器。手指和手掌在或缓或急的敲击着，其中有一种“鼓”，很像我们唐代盛行的“羯鼓”。其间或当有“因缘”的关系吧。
    瓦拉雅特·侯赛尼·康恩的“西塔”独奏，博得广大的欢迎。“西塔”是一种弦乐器，有二十多根弦，音调变化无穷。我们的好些在座的音乐家们都十分注意这个乐器。
    最后是“卡塔卡利舞”，这是从印度大史诗“马哈布哈拉他”里取来的一段故事舞。
        “马哈布哈拉他”（Mahabharata）是印度的，也是世界的最长的史诗，分十八篇，包含诗句二十余万行，其篇幅八倍于希腊二大史诗“依利亚特”和“奥特赛”的合计。“马哈布哈拉他”的故事在印度是家喻户晓的。有许多戏曲、歌曲是取材于这篇大史诗的。这篇大史诗的作者，相传是“吠陀”的编者委耶沙（Vyasa）。它不仅以篇章的异常浩瀚著名，而且是古代印度人民美丽的想像与传说，人民的生活与思想的大宝库。那简单的故事是这样：潘达瓦斯（Pandavas）族和古鲁斯（Kurus）族之间，成了仇恨。古鲁斯族的都达约达那以赌博赢得了潘达瓦斯族的国土，潘达瓦斯族的阿琪那兄弟们并被罚隐居于森林中十二年。放逐的期限过去了，潘达瓦斯族向古鲁斯族索取国土，但都达约达那坚执不还。两族之间遂发生了大战。那是一场血淋淋的极恐怖的战争，一直战到十八天才告结束。胜利归于潘达瓦斯族。克里西那神是帮助潘达瓦斯族的阿琪那的。阿琪那与他的仇敌卡尔那的决战，是震天撼地的一场大斗争。阿琪那终于杀死了卡尔那。最后，又杀死了都达约达那。
    在这个“卡塔卡利舞”里，只提到克里西那神怎样帮助潘达瓦斯族和都达约达那的怎样被杀死。
    这种“卡塔卡利舞”，我们前年在印度访问时，也曾在南印度的一个地方见到。当时，我们就很惊奇于它和我们京戏里以净色为主角的武戏很相似。（那时看的是印度另一部大史诗“拉马耶那”里的一段故事舞。）金鼓齐鸣，打着花脸的武将们在决战，除了“卡塔卡利舞”的歌曲是由歌者唱着之外，
    一切都十分相似。
    中、印两国人民之间的友谊是悠久而深厚的，中、印两国的文化、艺术是有着千丝万缕的关系的。
        “卡塔卡利舞”是由诗人瓦拉托尔·纳拉雅纳·梅农的舞蹈队演出的。这次他自己也来了。他充满了对中国的热情。中国文化代表团到印度访问时，他曾经写信邀请过我们到他那里去，到他所主办的艺术学校去。可惜我们没能去得成。隔了两年，我们终于在北京见到了他，并见到他所领导的表演“卡塔卡利舞”的艺术家们，这是使我们特别感到兴奋的事。
    敬祝印度艺术代表团的成功！（附图片）
