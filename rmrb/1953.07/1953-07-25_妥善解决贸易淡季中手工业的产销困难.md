To properly solve the production and sales difficulties of the handicraft industry during the trade off-season.

During the current trade off-season, handicraft producers are encountering some difficulties, mainly in the form of product backlog and lack of funds; some handicraft workers are even unable to maintain normal production. To overcome the current difficulties in handicraft production, first of all, handicraft workers should realize that they must face the countryside and serve agricultural production.

In the foreseeable future, agricultural production in our country will still have to rely on manual tools. As it stands today, 60 to 80 percent of the production materials (such as farm tools and fertilizers) and daily necessities (such as cloth, towels, and shoes) needed by farmers rely on supplies from urban and rural handicraft workers. The sales market for handicraft products in rural areas is extremely broad. As long as handicraft workers genuinely face the countryside and actively serve agricultural production, the existing difficulties can be alleviated. With the arrival of the peak season after autumn, normal handicraft production will inevitably achieve a certain degree of development, which is beyond doubt.

In order to implement the operating policy of facing the countryside and actively serving agricultural production, in the current situation, handicraft workers with accumulated products should implement the method of carrying goods to the countryside for sales promotion. The foundry industry in Zhoukou Town, Henan Province, once suffered sluggish business due to natural disasters in nearby rural areas, with a backlog of 50,000 catties of finished products. These handicraft workers actively participated in material exchange meetings in nearby districts and towns based on the needs of local farmers, and went deep into the countryside to promote sales, selling more than 20,000 catties of products in more than a month. Among them, Geng Baoxing sold more than 3,000 catties of products in half a month, and circulated funds of more than two million yuan four times during the famine, maintaining normal production during the off-season. Handicraft workers taking goods to the countryside for sales promotion not only saves farmers time during the current busy farming season, but also saves them the cost of going to the streets to buy goods. Farmers welcome this approach.

Carrying goods to the countryside for sales promotion is an effective way to expand sales, but opening up sales channels should not only focus on the immediate future, but also make long-term plans. Handicraft workers should strive to improve product quality and ensure fair prices, so as to establish credit, build long-term supply relationships with farmers, and lay the foundation for future sales. One of the important conditions for handicraft workers to gain the trust of farmers is to ensure product quality. The current operating style of some handicraft workers who produce shoddy products and do not keep their promises must be changed. The Wuchang Jinshui Gate Handicraft Industry Association conducted publicity in the surrounding rural areas on "guaranteeing quality, durability, fair prices, and return or exchange," and put this into practice. When the local handicraft industry association found that members had shoddy manufacturing behavior, they convened meetings for inspection, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and urged them to improve; and instructed members to write the name of the manufacturing household on the finished product for return or exchange. This ensured product quality, established credibility, and gained the trust of farmers, and the turnover in April, May, and June this year doubled compared with the same period last year. The operating style of Jinshui Gate handicraft workers, which emphasizes product quality, is worthy of emulation by handicraft workers everywhere.

Handicraft workers can also take the opportunity to establish supply relationships with rural supply and marketing cooperatives or peddlers when carrying goods to the countryside for sales promotion, and promote sales through their help, and correctly estimate the quantity of sales during the peak season based on their needs, and gradually strengthen the planning of production. After the foundry industry in Zhoukou Town, Henan Province, promoted sales in the countryside, it has restored and established more than 20 new and old customer relationships, and is now producing orders for new and old customers.

In order to overcome the difficulties in production and sales of the handicraft industry during the trade off-season, issues such as raw material procurement, bank loans, and processing orders must be properly resolved. Because China's handicraft industry has the characteristics of decentralized production, backward management, lack of funds, and strong seasonality, in terms of production and sales, it should focus on guiding self-production and self-sales, and improving quality in order to open up sales channels. Local industrial and commercial administrative departments, state-owned commercial departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives should help them solve the difficulties in purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products under the conditions of need and possibility. Local supply and marketing cooperatives should establish close contact with local handicraft workers, sign contracts, supply raw materials, and promote finished products produced by handicraft workers that are needed by members. Handicraft products are an important part of the source of goods organized by supply and marketing cooperatives today. At present, some cadres of cooperatives and state-owned commercial companies neglect the actual needs of local farmers, have a "famous brand" mentality, and believe that handicraft products are not well-known, so they do not actively organize handicraft production. This practice is wrong and should be corrected quickly. In terms of bank loans, the needs of handicraft production should be taken into account, and conveniences such as extending the time limit and simplifying procedures should be provided in accordance with the seasonal production and sales situation. Handicraft production has great blindness, which is very unfavorable to handicraft workers themselves and to the entire social economy. Therefore, local industrial and commercial administrative departments should conduct serious investigations and research on the production and sales of the handicraft industry, so as to have a clear understanding and strengthen the leadership of handicraft production.

Correctly distinguishing the boundaries between the three different relationships of labor-capital, employment, and master-apprentice in the handicraft industry is the key to fully mobilizing the enthusiasm for handicraft production. In areas where attention is paid to conducting policy education for handicraft workers and correctly adjusting these three relationships, the enthusiasm of handicraft workers for production is high. When adjusting these relationships existing in the handicraft industry, the guiding principle of focusing on improving production should be implemented. Any practice that deviates from this guiding principle will make the work of adjusting relationships lose its purpose, and even if the relationships are adjusted, they cannot be consolidated. Some areas do not pay attention to studying and solving the current difficulties in handicraft production when dealing with various relationships in the handicraft industry, or drag out the time for adjusting relationships for a long time, thus hindering production, which is inappropriate and should be corrected. In order to correct these phenomena and properly solve the current difficulties in handicraft production, local party and government leading organs should attach importance to the leadership of handicraft production, and should promote the economic and financial departments to actively support handicraft production as needed and as possible.

### 妥善解决贸易淡季中手工业的产销困难

    妥善解决贸易淡季中手工业的产销困难
    在目前的贸易淡季中，手工业生产者遇到一些困难，主要是产品积压，资金缺乏；有些手工业者甚至已不能维持正常的生产。为克服目前手工业生产的困难，首先应使手工业者认识他们必须面向农村，为农业生产服务。
    我国的农业生产在今后一个较长时期内，还必须使用手工工具。以目前的情况来说：农民的生产资料（如农具、肥料）和生活资料（如布、手巾、鞋袜），有百分之六十至百分之八十依靠城乡手工业者供应。手工业品在农村中的销路是极其广阔的。只要手工业者真正面向农村，积极为农业生产服务，目前存在的困难，是可能减轻的。而随着秋后旺季的到来，正常的手工业生产必然得到一定程度的发展，也是没有疑问的。
    为贯彻面向农村，积极为农业生产服务的经营方针，在目前，积压了产品的手工业者应当实行带货下乡的推销方法。河南周口镇的翻砂业，曾因附近农村遭受自然灾害，营业清淡，积压成品达五万斤。这些手工业者根据当地农民需要，积极参加附近地区的集、镇物资交流会，并深入农村推销，在一个多月的时间内，推销产品二万多斤。其中耿保兴号在半个月内推销产品三千多斤，二百多万元资金在灾荒期间周转了四次，维持了淡季中的正常生产。手工业者带货下乡推销，不但节省了农民在目前农忙季节中的时间，并且还节省了他们上街买货的花费。农民是很欢迎这种办法的。
    带货下乡推销是扩大销路的有效方法，但打开销路，不应光顾眼前，还要作长期打算。手工业者应该努力提高产品质量，作到价钱公道，以便树立信用，和农民建立长远的供应关系，给今后的销路打下基础。手工业者取得农民信任的重要条件之一，就是保证产品的质量。目前有些手工业者粗制滥造，不守信用的经营作风，必须改变过来。武昌金水闸手工业联合会到四乡进行“保证质量、经久耐用、作价公道、包调回换”的宣传，并在实际行动中做到了这一点。当地手工业联合会发现会员有粗制滥造行为时，就召开会议检查，开展批评与自我批评，督促他们加以改进；并责成会员在成品上写上制造户招牌，以便包调回换。这样就保证了产品质量，树立了信誉，得到了农民的信任，今年四、五、六月营业额比去年同期增加了一倍。金水闸手工业者这种重视产品质量的经营作风，是值得各地手工业者效法的。
    手工业者带货下乡推销，还可借此机会和农村供销合作社或货贩建立供应关系，通过他们帮助推销，并根据他们的需要，正确估计旺季销货数量，逐渐加强生产的计划性。河南周口镇翻砂业下乡推销后，已恢复和建立了二十多处新旧顾主关系，最近已在为新旧顾主的定货进行生产。
    为克服贸易淡季中手工业的产销困难，对于原料采购、银行贷款与加工定货等问题，必须予以妥善解决。由于我国手工业具有生产分散，经营落后，资金缺乏，季节性浓厚等特点，所以在产销方面，应该着重引导其自产自销，提高品质，以打开销路。各地工商行政部门、国营商业部门和供销合作社在需要与可能的条件下，应当帮助其解决采购原料和推销成品的困难。各地供销合作社更应该与当地手工业者建立密切联系，订立合同，供应原料，推销手工业者所生产的而又为社员所需要的成品。手工业产品是今天供销合作社组织货源的重要部分，目前有些合作社和国营商业公司干部，忽视当地农民的实际需要，存有“名牌货”思想，认为手工业产品不出名，因而不积极组织手工业生产。这种做法是错误的，应该迅速纠正。在银行贷款方面，应照顾到手工业生产的需要，配合季节的产销情况，给予延长时间、简化手续等便利。手工业生产具有很大盲目性，这对手工业者本身是很不利的，对整个社会经济也是不利的。因此，各地工商行政部门对手工业的产销情况，应进行认真的调查研究，作到心中有数，以加强对手工业生产的领导。
    正确划清手工业中劳资、雇佣、师徒这三种不同的关系的界限，这是充分发挥手工业生产积极性的关键。凡是重视了对手工业者进行政策教育和正确调整了这三种关系的地区，手工业者的生产积极性就高。调整手工业中存在着的这些关系时，应该贯彻以搞好生产为主的方针，任何脱离这个方针的做法，都会使调整关系的工作失去其目的性，即使关系调整了也不能巩固。有些地区在处理手工业中各种关系时，对目前手工业生产中存在的困难不注意研究解决，或者把调整关系的时间拖得很长，因而妨害了生产，这是不妥当的，应该加以纠正。为纠正这些现象，妥善解决目前手工业生产的困难，各地党政领导机关应重视对手工业生产的领导，并应推动财经各部门，根据需要和可能，积极对手工业生产予以扶助。
