The basic construction projects under the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau have experienced widespread issues of low quality and slow progress, failing to meet the state plan on schedule.

In the responsibility system establishment campaign, some basic construction units under the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau have paid attention to engineering quality. For example, the riveting and welding project of the Harbin Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau's Riveting and Welding Factory at the large motor factory construction site was inspected by Soviet experts and deemed fully compliant with quality standards. The Northeast 301 Factory project has significantly improved engineering quality through the anti-waste campaign and the establishment of a responsibility system. However, in most basic construction units, quality accidents remain extremely frequent.

The 501 Factory experienced 190 quality accidents in March alone. The dormitory project at the Southwest Damaitian construction site had to be completely reworked because the dimensions were incorrect. The concrete base position of the Southwest Cableway project was severely off due to measurement errors, with significant discrepancies in horizontal level and a horizontal distance exceeding the original design by five meters. The First Engineering Company's key project, the large motor factory construction site, saw guaranteed quality in the first phase after the establishment of the responsibility system. However, the leadership became complacent as a result and failed to thoroughly implement various systems. Coupled with design errors, serious quality accidents occurred in the recently constructed factory building's concrete columns, with some columns needing to be demolished and rebuilt.

The main reasons for frequent quality accidents are the construction units' insufficient attention to quality, the failure to establish a quality responsibility system, or the failure to implement it even if it was established. The quality standards formulated by the 501 Factory even allowed for honeycomb surfaces with a depth of up to five centimeters (concrete projects should not have honeycomb surfaces at all). Some units do not conduct scientific experiments at all during construction, and some construction units have not yet established inspection agencies.

The engineering progress of many basic construction units under the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau has not met the state plan. The most serious factors affecting engineering progress are the untimely design, budgeting, and approval work. Among the 29 projects that the Fourth Engineering Company should have started by early June but had not, 10 were awaiting technical designs and 7 were awaiting approval of the general layout plan. Due to delays in design and approval, the designs of some projects that had already started had not been approved; some projects started without drawings; and some projects even had construction drawings made only after completion. Furthermore, many projects could not produce design budgets because the material unit prices were not determined; some that were produced were not reviewed and approved, thus delaying the signing of contracting contracts and affecting the start of construction. No one is responsible for the preparation and implementation of construction operation plans, and most construction units lack practical operation plans, resulting in chaotic site management, which also affects engineering progress.

In response to the above situation, the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau has successively convened basic construction engineering meetings and manager meetings, and issued instructions requiring all units to closely integrate the establishment of the responsibility system campaign with ensuring engineering quality and completing engineering plans. In terms of ensuring engineering quality, all units are required to strengthen quality education for employees and establish a quality-first concept among the masses; formulate and implement quality standards, and simultaneously establish a technical quality responsibility system, strengthen quality inspection, scientific experiments, measurement and layout, as well as the responsibility system for the study, familiarity, and joint review of large samples. In terms of ensuring engineering progress, all units are required to strengthen ideological education on plan management and establish a concept of completing state plans among the masses. At the same time, they must conscientiously formulate construction operation plans, establish or improve the dispatch system, and regularly check the completion of operation plans. The instructions also require all units to promote various advanced experiences in basic construction to accelerate progress and ensure quality.

    上半年工程质量不好进度迟缓
    有色金属工业管理局所属的基本建设工程，质量低劣、进度迟缓，不能按期完成国家计划的情况相当普遍。
    有色金属工业管理局基本建设单位在建立责任制运动中，有些已经注意了工程质量问题，如哈尔滨有色金属工业管理局铆焊厂在大型电机厂工地的铆焊装吊工程，经苏联专家检查，认为完全合乎质量标准。东北三○一厂工程，在反浪费和建立责任制中，已经显著地提高了工程质量。但在大多数的基本建设单位中，质量事故仍然极为频繁。
    五○一厂在三月份一个月内发生质量事故一百九十件。西南大麦田工地的宿舍工程因为修盖的尺寸不合，因而全部返工。西南索道工程的混凝土基座位置，由于测量错误，水平高低相差悬殊，水平距离较原设计多出了五公尺。第一工程公司的重点工程——大型电机厂工地，建立责任制后，第一期工程质量得到保证。但是，领导方面因此麻痹自满，没有深入贯彻各种制度，加上设计错误，最近施工的厂房混凝土柱子发生了严重的质量事故，有的柱子需要打掉重做。
    质量事故频繁的主要原因是，施工单位对质量重视不够，质量责任制度没有建立，或者是建立了而没有贯彻。五○一厂制订的质量标准竟规定允许有五公分深以下的蜂窝麻面（混凝土工程根本不应该有蜂窝麻面）。有的单位在施工中根本不做科学试验，有的施工单位至今还没有建立检查机构。
    有色金属工业管理局各基本建设单位的工程进度，很多都没有完成国家计划。影响工程进度最严重的是设计、预算和审核批准工作不及时。第四工程公司到六月上旬应开工而没有开工的二十九件工程中，有十件等技术设计，有七件等总平面配置图的审核批准。因为设计和审核迟缓，有的单位已开工的工程，设计大都没有经过审核批准；有的工程没有图样就开了工；甚至有的工程完工以后才做出施工图。还有很多工程因为材料单价不定，设计预算大部做不出来；有的做出来了，也没人审核批准，因而延误了包工合同的签订，影响开工。施工作业计划的编制和贯彻也无人负责，大部分施工单位尚无切实可行的作业计划，因而工地管理混乱，也是影响工程进度的原因。
    根据上述情况，有色金属工业管理局曾经先后召开了基本建设工务会议和经理会议，并发出指示，要求各单位，把建立责任制运动和保证工程质量完成工程计划密切结合起来。在保证工程质量方面，要求各单位对职工加强质量教育，在群众中树立质量第一的观念；制订并贯彻质量标准，同时建立技术质量责任制，加强质量检查、科学试验、测量放线以及大样的研究、熟悉和会审等责任制度。在保证工程进度方面，要求各单位加强计划管理的思想教育工作，在群众中树立完成国家计划观念。同时认真制定施工作业计划，建立或健全调度制度，定期检查作业计划的完成情况。指示并要求各单位推广基本建设中的各种先进经验，以加快进度，保证质量。
