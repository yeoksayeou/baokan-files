    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine
    Completes July Production Task Nine Days Ahead of Schedule
    The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine completed its first month's coal production task—the July task—at 8:00 a.m. on July 22, more than nine days ahead of schedule, after beginning production. Moreover, the quality of the coal produced met the standards.
    After the open-pit mine went into production, the mine bureau leadership quickly grasped the characteristics of mechanized coal mining—the key to completing the production task is a high degree of planning, organization, and close coordination between departments. Therefore, on the basis of the original plans of each shift and team, the relevant units such as mining, transportation, liaison, and dispatching were organized to sign production contact contracts, and a mining liaison group was formed to provide unified leadership, so that all units closely cooperated, thereby ensuring smooth mining and the smooth transportation of the mined coal. After the open-pit mine's workers went into production, they launched a labor emulation campaign to exceed the first month's production task. Due to the efforts of the workers, the time for electric shovels to excavate and load a train of side-tipping cars was shortened from the 50 minutes originally stipulated by the mine bureau to 40 minutes. When a train of coal cars was about to be filled, the coal miners immediately notified the dispatching room to send new cars, which greatly shortened the transportation time compared to the past.
    Currently, the mine workers are throwing themselves into a new production upsurge. Although some soil layers have been greatly affected by continuous rainfall in mid-July, making work very difficult, the soil removal workers have demonstrated their labor enthusiasm, enabling work to proceed at a normal pace.

    阜新海州露天煤矿
    提前九天完成七月份生产任务
    阜新海州露天矿已在七月二十二日上午八时提前九天多完成了开始生产后的第一个月——七月份的产煤任务，而且产煤的质量都合乎标准。
    露天矿进入生产后，矿务局领导上很快抓住了机械化采煤的特点——完成生产任务的关键即高度的计划性、组织性和各部门的紧密配合。因此，在各班、组原订计划的基础上，组织采煤、运输、联络、调度等有关单位签订了生产的联系合同，并组成采煤联络组统一领导，使所有单位都紧密合作，从而保证了顺利地采煤，并且把采出的煤顺利地运出去。露天矿的职工在投入生产后即为超额完成第一个月生产任务而展开了劳动竞赛。由于职工们的努力，电铲采掘与装载一列自翻车的时间由矿务局原规定的五十分钟缩短到四十分钟。当一列装煤车将要装满时，采煤工人马上通知调度室再来新车，使运输时间比过去大大缩短了。
    目前，该矿工人正投入新的生产热潮。虽然部分土层因受中旬连日降雨的影响，工作非常困难，但剥离土层工人们发挥了劳动积极性，使工作能够按正常速度进行。
