    苏彝士运河区英军实行威胁行动英国和埃及关系紧张
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社开罗讯：据报纸报道，由于埃及拒绝了英国要求交还一个英国空军人员的最后通牒，以及英军司令部在十三日上午开始实行它的威胁行动，在伊斯美利亚和整个苏彝士运河区都已造成紧张局势。据英国方面说，英国空军人员是九日在伊斯美利亚失踪的。英国已在伊斯美利亚和塞得港宣布紧急状态，在这两个城市的各个入口设置了路障，并搜查火车、公共汽车和其他车辆。
    “埃及人报”报道，塞得港已禁止举行集会和示威。逮捕埃及人以及英国驻军和当地人民冲突的事件已经发生。开罗“消息报”报道，已有二十七个埃及人在伊斯美利亚被逮捕。
    据报纸报道，埃及国家指导部部长（宣传部部长）萨勒姆在十三日发表声明，指责苏彝士运河区的事件是英国驻埃及临时代办汉基挑拨起来的。萨勒姆说，这次挑拨行动是汉基最近在伊斯美利亚逗留几天以后制造出来的。
