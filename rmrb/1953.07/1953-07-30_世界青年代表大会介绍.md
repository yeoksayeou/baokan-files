    Introduction to the World Youth Congress
    The Third World Youth Congress opened on July 25th in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. This is a major event in the world youth movement. Because the world youth movement is a huge force fighting for peace, it is also a major event in the world peace movement.
    The organized democratic youth movement on a world scale began to take shape shortly after the end of World War II. The youth of all countries, who had suffered deeply from the disasters of the war, were eager to organize their forces to defend peace and their rights after the war. In November 1945, more than 500 delegates representing 30 million young people from 63 countries held the First World Youth Congress in London. The conference discussed three issues: the struggle of young people for lasting peace, the needs of young people after the war, and the organization of international youth cooperation. After discussion, the conference decided that the task of the world democratic youth movement was to unite the world's democratic youth and fight to defend world peace, strive for youth rights, and create a better future. The conference also decided to establish the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDF) as a permanent body to lead the world democratic youth movement. After this conference, the WFDF and democratic youth organizations in various countries united the vast number of young people through various means. In 1948, under the initiation and organization of the WFDF, the Southeast Asia Youth Conference was held in India, and the Latin American Youth Congress was held in Mexico, further uniting the vast number of young people in colonial and dependent countries. The membership of colonial and dependent countries joining the WFDF increased from 3 million in 1946 to 10 million in 1949. In capitalist countries, the democratic youth movement has also made great progress.
    In September 1949, more than 700 delegates representing 60 million young people from 72 countries held the Second World Youth Congress in Budapest. At that time, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States had begun to organize new military aggression alliances and was preparing for new wars on a large scale, which seriously threatened peace. People from all countries in the world therefore rose up and launched a broad movement to defend peace. The Budapest Conference, held under these circumstances, emphasized that young people should actively participate in the struggle to defend peace, and determined that the basic slogan of the WFDF should be: "Youths of the world, unite! Advance, for lasting peace, for democracy, for national independence of all peoples and a brighter future!" After the Budapest Conference, the world democratic youth movement further combined the struggle of young people to defend their rights with the struggle to defend peace. The WFDF actively mobilized and organized young people from various countries to support various calls of the world peace movement. Young people from all countries have become active participants in the peace movement. Through these struggles to defend peace and youth rights, the world democratic youth movement has greatly expanded its ranks. Currently, the WFDF has 75 million members in 88 countries. In the capitalist world, the imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation in recent years has caused great suffering to the vast number of young people. Young people of different classes, political and religious beliefs in various countries are now demanding to defend peace and defend their rights.
    It is precisely under these circumstances that the WFDF decided to convene the Third World Youth Congress. Representatives of organizations from countries affiliated with the WFDF, as well as representatives of youth organizations that have not been in contact with the WFDF in the past, participated in this conference. The task of this conference is to unite as many of the entire young generation as possible to further expand the united front of the world youth movement. The conference will discuss various issues of concern to the young generation of various countries, the struggles of young people to have their demands met and to fight for their rights, as well as the methods and means of struggle.
        At a time when the international situation has shown new hope for possible detente, and people all over the world are vigorously carrying out the movement to strive for consultations among the major powers to resolve international disputes, the holding of this World Youth Congress is of even greater significance. This conference, which symbolizes the great unity of the world's youth, will undoubtedly further expand the world youth movement and add new strength to the world's movement for consultation.

    世界青年代表大会介绍
    第三届世界青年代表大会于七月二十五日在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特开幕。这是世界青年运动中的一件大事。由于世界青年运动是一支为和平而斗争的巨大力量，因此，这也是世界和平运动中的一件大事。
    世界规模的有组织的民主青年运动，是在第二次世界大战刚结束以后就开始形成的。在大战中深受战争灾难的各国青年，在大战结束后，迫切地要求把他们的力量组织起来，来保卫和平与他们的权利。一九四五年十一月，代表着六十三个国家三千万青年的五百多位代表，在伦敦举行了第一届世界青年代表大会。这次大会讨论了三个问题：青年们为争取持久和平而斗争，战后青年的需要，以及组织国际间青年的合作。大会经过讨论后，决定世界民主青年运动的任务是：团结世界民主青年，为保卫世界和平，争取青年权利和美好的将来而斗争。大会并决定成立世界民主青年联盟（简称世界青联），作为领导这个世界民主青年运动的常设机构。在这次大会后，世界青联及各国民主青年组织通过各种方式，团结各国广大青年。一九四八年在世界青联发起和组织下，在印度召开了东南亚青年大会，在墨西哥召开了拉丁美洲青年代表大会，进一步团结了殖民地及附属国的广大青年。加入世界青联的殖民地及附属国的会员在一九四六年时为三百万人，到一九四九年就增加到一千万人。在资本主义国家中，民主青年运动也获得很大开展。
    一九四九年九月，代表着七十二个国家六千万青年的七百多位代表，在布达佩斯举行了第二届世界青年代表大会。当时，以美国为首的帝国主义集团已开始组织新的军事侵略联盟，大规模地准备新的战争，使和平受到严重威胁，世界各国人民因此纷起展开了广泛的保卫和平运动。在这种形势下举行的布达佩斯大会，强调指出青年们要积极参加保卫和平的斗争，并确定世界青联的基本口号为：“青年们团结起来！前进，争取持久和平、争取民主、争取各国人民的民族独立和美好的将来！”在布达佩斯大会后，世界民主青年运动就进一步把青年保卫他们权利的斗争和保卫和平的斗争结合起来。世界青联积极地动员和组织各国青年支持世界和平运动的各项号召。各国青年成为和平运动的积极参加者。通过这些保卫和平和青年权利斗争，世界民主青年运动大大扩大了自己的队伍。目前，世界青联已在八十八个国家中有着七千五百万会员了。在资本主义世界各国，帝国主义几年来的扩军备战政策已使广大青年遭受到深重灾难，各国不同阶层、不同政治和宗教信仰的青年，现在都在要求保卫和平与保卫他们的权利。
    正是在这种情况下，世界青联决定召开第三届世界青年代表大会。参加这届大会有世界青联所属各国组织的代表，也有过去与世界青联没有联系的青年组织的代表。这届大会的任务是，团结尽可能多的整个年青的一代，来进一步扩大世界青年运动的统一战线。大会要讨论各国年青一代所关心的各项问题，要讨论青年们为使他们的要求得到满足和为争取他们的权利而进行斗争的问题，以及斗争的方式和方法问题。
        在国际局势出现了可能缓和的新希望，全世界人民正在大力开展争取大国协商来解决国际争端的运动的今天，这届世界青年代表大会的举行更具有特
    别重要的意义。这个象征着世界青年大团结的会
    议，无疑将使世界青年运动进一步展开，而为世界
    争取协商运动增添新的力量。　（新华社）
