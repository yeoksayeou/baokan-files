    Anhui Provincial Forestry Bureau
    Should Pay Attention to Timber Supply Work
    Huang Shirong from China Coal Construction Company Anhui Branch writes: Since January of this year, our company's timber procurement business has been transferred to the Anhui Provincial Forestry Bureau upon instructions from higher authorities. The Forestry Bureau then allocates the timber to our company for market supply. On January 6th, our company and the Forestry Bureau jointly studied the annual timber allocation plan for this year. The result of the study was that the Forestry Bureau would allocate 80,000 cubic meters of timber to our company throughout the year, including 30,000 cubic meters in the first quarter, 20,000 cubic meters in the second quarter, 20,000 cubic meters in the third quarter, and 10,000 cubic meters in the fourth quarter, and an agreement was signed on January 7th. Later, our company sent people to negotiate with the Forestry Bureau to sign a specific contract for the 30,000 cubic meters in the first quarter, but the bureau refused to negotiate, emphasizing that the task was large and they could not deliver the goods without an allocation order. After repeated negotiations, we still failed to reach a resolution. Therefore, our company had to report the situation to higher authorities, and the superior company also repeatedly requested the Central Ministry of Commerce to report to the Central Financial and Economic Commission for resolution. On May 15th, the Anhui Provincial Financial and Economic Commission received instructions from higher authorities that the 30,000 cubic meters of timber in the first quarter signed by the Anhui Provincial Forestry Bureau should continue to be allocated. The Provincial Financial and Economic Commission then convened a joint consultation between the Forestry Bureau and our company on June 9th. The result of the consultation was: The Forestry Bureau should deliver the 30,000 cubic meters of timber immediately at the Longquan Wharf, measured according to the market acquisition price plus taxes and certain management fees. On June 10th, our company sent people to contact the Forestry Bureau to complete the formalities, but the bureau then proposed to inspect and deliver the timber according to the new inspection method. After several days of negotiations, no result was achieved. We believe that the bureau is making various excuses for not implementing the instructions of higher authorities and not fulfilling the agreement, which affects market supply and the supply of materials for national capital construction. This is very wrong, and we hope that the bureau will quickly correct it.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    安徽省森林工业管理局
    应重视木材供应工作
    中国煤建公司安徽分公司黄世镕来信：我公司收购木材的业务，自今年一月份起，奉上级指示移交安徽森林工业管理局，然后由森林工业管理局拨交我公司供应市场。一月六日，我公司和森林工业管理局共同研究今年全年木材调拨计划，研究结果，由森林工业管理局全年拨交我公司木材八万立方公尺，其中第一季度三万立方公尺，第二季度二万立方公尺，第三季度二万立方公尺，第四季度一万立方公尺，并于一月七日签订协议。后来我公司即派人与森林工业管理局洽商签订第一季度三万立方公尺的具体合同，而该局却拒绝洽商，并强调任务大，未奉调拨令不能交货，经我们一再交涉，仍然没有获得解决。因此，我公司只好将情况上报，上级公司也迭请中央商业部转报中央财政经济委员会解决。五月十五日，安徽省财政经济委员会接上级指示，安徽省森林工业管理局签订的第一季度三万立方公尺木材应继续拨交。省财政经济委员会即于六月九日召集森林工业管理局与我公司共同协商，协商结果：该三万立方公尺木材由森林工业管理局根据产地收购价加上税收及一定的管理费用，按龙泉码检尺即日交接。六月十日，我公司即派人与森林工业管理局联系办理手续，而该局又提出要按新检尺法检交，经交涉几天仍无结果。我们认为该局提出各种藉口不执行上级指示、不履行协议，致影响市场供应和国家基本建设用料的供应，这是很不应该的，希望该局迅速纠正。
