    Heroic Position and Heroic Platoon
    Xu Jianmin

    I.

    Early in the morning, Platoon Leader Liu Zuocai returned from the company headquarters and dashed into the Fourth Platoon's dugout. Before he could catch his breath, he announced to everyone: "Comrades, it's approved! Tonight, we'll take over from the Seventh Platoon and defend Hill 222.9." Before the platoon leader finished speaking, all the comrades in the platoon stood up with a "唰" sound, raising their fists and swearing in unison: "For the Party, for Chairman Mao, we fear no sacrifice and will certainly complete the mission!" A little later, the Party branch received an application to join the Party: "Please let the branch examine my loyalty to the Party's cause in this battle. If I meet the requirements of a Party member, I hope to be admitted into the Party." The signature below was "Ni Xiangming."

    This was July 20, 1952.

    This position, located in the towering mountains on the south bank of the Imjin River on the western front of the Korean battlefield, had been captured for the fourth time by a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who annihilated more than 190 enemies in six minutes. The enemy then launched desperate counterattacks, and the battle for control was fiercely underway.

    Thick clouds hung over the mountain all day, and only with great difficulty did the sky darken. The brief moment of calm at dusk passed, and with the coming of night, the enemy's artillery fire grew more and more intense. Shells exploded incessantly in the valleys and on the slopes between our main position and the forward position, igniting patches of flame. At this moment, the Fourth Platoon soldiers, who had been fully armed and waiting all day, leapt out of the dugout like tigers, braving the late wind and rain and the enemy's artillery fire to advance to the front. The smiling face and earnest words of Company Commander Yang Yinshan, who had specially come to the dugout to explain the mission, were still floating in everyone's minds. They felt that this was the Party and the superiors' infinite concern and expectation for them, adding so much courage and strength to them!

    They stepped over the enemy's artillery blockade, stepped over the slopes and valleys that had been pulverized by the artillery fire, and finally arrived at Hill 222.9. Here, they could not see a single blade of grass or tree, only two bare tree stumps covered with honeycomb-like bullet marks; here, they could not hear a single insect chirp, only the roar of bombs and the whine of bullets; in some places, even the traces of the communication trenches had been blasted away. This situation even more stirred the soldiers' hearts of revenge. On the small spur extending from the right side, in an air-raid shelter shattered by artillery fire, they met their comrades from the Seventh Platoon. After explaining the situation and checking the ammunition, they saw off the Seventh Platoon comrades who had defended the position for three days and nights, and immediately began to repair fortifications according to the planned arrangements, preparing to resist the enemy's attack.

    II.

    After a day and night of intense labor under the enemy's artillery fire, the Fourth Platoon completed the preparations for resisting the enemy and defending the position. The tunnels were cleared, and the communication trenches with shelters were built. The soldiers said excitedly: "We are confident now, let the beasts come and attack!"

    It was July 21st. Night covered the position. The enemy had not yet made any movement. The sky was pitch black, and rain fell in bursts, sometimes heavy and sometimes light. The wind, mixed with cold rain, swirled into the cave entrance. Platoon Leader Shi Linhe and Platoon Leader Liu Zuocai deeply realized that the soldiers, after their intense labor, needed to recover their strength well. Even a moment of sleep would be very precious to the comrades and would increase their fighting power. This was a rare opportunity, a moment of calm before the fierce battle. So they ordered everyone to rest quickly and prepare to meet the battle. The comrades guarded vigilantly with their weapons, wrapped in clothes soaked with sweat and rain, and huddled together on the wet ground, where not even a single blade of grass grew, and began to rest. Shi Linhe and Liu Zuocai watched the comrades fall asleep, and they opened the only two overcoats in the whole platoon to cover them. Then, together with Zhou Yuande and Ge Fangming, who were on sentry duty outside the cave, they carried box after box of grenades with the lids open to the front of the fortifications and the cave entrance. Then Shi Linhe, holding his carbine, braced his feet against the wall opposite the cave entrance and leaned against the right side of the cave entrance; Liu Zuocai also took the same posture as him and leaned against the left side of the cave entrance. They were sheltering the soldiers lying in the cave from the wind and rain. They were also drowsy, but they would wake up with a jolt. They could not sleep peacefully, because this was a forward position where battles could break out at any moment! They also cared about the sentries outside the cave—Zhou Yuande and Ge Fangming, who could not rest. When they heard the snoring of the soldiers who were sound asleep, they felt great comfort in their hearts.

    All the soldiers in the cave were fast asleep, but only Deputy Platoon Leader Ni Xiangming was awake. He was deeply moved by the strong spirit of Liu Zuocai, a communist. He – a child born into a poor peasant family in Henan, before liberation, suffered untold hardships in the so-called "Four Disasters of Henan: floods, droughts, locusts, and warlords". After liberation, he felt the warmth of the new society; after joining the Volunteer Army, he felt even more the warmth of the revolutionary family, but this feeling of warmth had never been as strong as it was now, making him excited. He thought of the oath he had taken at the swearing-in meeting before the battle and every word he had written in his application to join the Party. He gently moved away from the comrade who was leaning on him. He looked at the platoon leader and the platoon leader blocking the wind and rain for the comrades at the entrance of the cave, and he looked at the soldiers who were so tired from repairing the fortifications that they were sleeping so soundly. He felt that he could no longer lie down. He sat up, making almost no sound, and crept lightly from the gap between the legs and feet of the lying comrades to the entrance of the cave, and said to Liu Zuocai: "Platoon leader! Let me block the entrance of the cave, you go inside and rest, we all need you to command and win the battle!" Liu Zuocai was moved by Ni Xiangming's words. He deeply realized this great brotherly friendship, but he knew that he could not rest at this time, so he said to Ni Xiangming: "Deputy Platoon Leader, I can't rest, you take the soldiers to rest well! Prepare your strength to crush the enemy's attack!" Ni Xiangming climbed past the platoon leader to the platoon leader's side at the right cave entrance, wanting to replace the platoon leader for rest, but Shi Linhe also did not agree to his request. At this time, he thought of Zhou Yuande and Ge Fangming, who were on sentry duty outside the cave. He thought that he still had a set of dry clothes to change into, so he quickly took it out and unexpectedly found two biscuits. He was extremely happy and immediately ran to the fortifications blown by the cold wind, gave the two biscuits to Ge Fangming to eat, and then turned to another cave entrance and found Zhou Yuande, stuffed the dry clothes into his hands, and said softly: "Put them on! It's too cold." Saying that, he took the gun from Zhou Yuande's hand.

    At this time, the night rain stopped, and a few stars twinkled in the gaps in the clouds in the clear sky. The surroundings were unusually silent. Only artillery shells with long fiery tails streaking through the sky overhead, bursting into sparks in the distance, could be seen. He and Zhou Yuande stood shoulder to shoulder, the cold wind blowing past them. Zhou Yuande was silent for a long time, and finally said: "Deputy Platoon Leader, I will use practical actions in battle to answer your usual care and cultivation of me!" Ni Xiangming smiled and said to Zhou Yuande: "Good! This is exactly the time for us to strive for honor!"

    Ni Xiangming returned to the cave, covered the coats on the bodies of the few comrades lying down, leaned against the cave wall, and sat with his body bent, drowsy. Just as he was half asleep, "Boom!" A grenade suddenly exploded outside the cave entrance. He quickly got up, and then heard Zhou Yuande's voice: "Comrades, the enemy is coming." Platoon Leader Liu Zuocai also shouted: "Comrades, quickly occupy the fortifications and eliminate the enemy!" With a "whoosh" sound, all the sleeping comrades got up, followed the platoon leader and platoon leader out of the cave, and quickly occupied the fortifications they had built during the day.

    III.

    After the Fourth Platoon comrades dispersed, the enemy had already reached a place only ten meters away from the fortifications, just right to deploy firepower to eliminate the enemy. Submachine guns and machine guns weaved a web of fire, and grenades and hand mines burst into flames one after another in the enemy ranks. The enemy was beaten back for a while, and then charged up again. After the battle began, the supporting artillery fire from the company's main position also densely hit the enemy's passing slopes. Light machine gunner and Communist Party member Wang Yi suffered a serious leg injury, but he still kept shooting; his right arm and face were also injured, but he still propped up his body, gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and threw grenades with his left hand. Ge Fangming's left hand and leg were also seriously injured, so he used his teeth to open the safety catch of the grenade and insisted on fighting with one hand.

    The fierce battle lasted for more than an hour without a break, and more than a hundred bodies of Japanese devils lying horizontally and vertically in front of the position were already there. At this critical moment in the battle, the outstanding Youth League member, Platoon Leader Shi Linhe, and soldiers Fu Xianzong and Wu Yongzhen heroically sacrificed their lives. Platoon Leader Liu Zuocai had already been wounded twice, but he continued to fight and command. He ran out of grenades in front of him, so he went to the cave entrance to carry ammunition boxes. At this time, a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head again. He was wounded for the third time, and blood flowed down from his head, blurring his eyes. He didn't even realize it. He wiped it with his hand and said, "Why is there so much sweat today!" As soon as he finished speaking, he fainted in the communication trench.

    At this time, only Ni Xiangming, Zhou Yuande, and Song Chengjiu, three lightly wounded comrades, persisted in fighting on the position. The heavy burden of command fell on the shoulders of Deputy Platoon Leader Ni Xiangming. They carried the wounded platoon leader and comrades into the cave. Ni Xiangming saw with his own eyes that some of his comrades had shed blood and some had contributed their precious youth. He had no tears anymore, and the flames of hatred were burning in his heart. He assigned Song Chengjiu the task of guarding the tunnel entrance and protecting the wounded, and he searched for ammunition in the cave, holding two grenades tightly in his hands, observing the enemy's movements from inside the cave entrance. At this time, suddenly five dark shadows of Japanese devils flickered on the communication trench outside the cave entrance. Ni Xiangming quickly said to Zhou Yuande: "The enemy is coming, let's eliminate them!" Saying that, he picked up a grenade and rushed out of the cave entrance, pouncing straight at the enemy. Five Japanese devils immediately pounced on him to grab him. Ni Xiangming swung his grenade and hammered it hard against the chest of a Japanese devil, and stretched out his arm to grab the collar of the Japanese devil, pressing hard, and the Japanese devil fell face down on the ground. The other four Japanese devils took the opportunity to pounce on him and tore at Ni Xiangming. Zhou Yuande also rushed up to support the deputy platoon leader, using all his strength to move two Japanese devils off the deputy platoon leader. Ni Xiangming stood up again, waving the hammer-like grenade and desperately hitting the heads of the Japanese devils. Song Chengjiu, who was guarding the tunnel, saw clearly the heroic scene of the deputy platoon leader, Zhou Yuande, and the enemy fighting in the light of the exploding shells and the flashing of the flares. He wanted to rush up to support, but he could not give up the task of guarding the tunnel and the wounded comrades. At this time, another five or six Japanese devils rushed up. He saw Ni Xiangming say something to Zhou Yuande, and then he heard Ni Xiangming shouting loudly: "Song Chengjiu, I want to fight the enemy..."

    When the Japanese devils rushed in front of Ni Xiangming and Zhou Yuande, they only heard Ni Xiangming and Zhou Yuande shout: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then, there were the continuous roars of four grenades. Some of the Japanese devils were killed and some were scared and retreated.

    IV.

    The dawn of the East radiated light, and the morning wind gently blew across this heroic position. Smoke mixed with morning mist floated over Hill 222.9, which had no grass or trees.

    A fully armed Chinese People's Volunteer combatant stood on the mountaintop where the martyrs sacrificed. He was Zhang Wenju, the assault platoon leader of the counterattack unit. On the night of the 20th, he was the one who handed over the defense to the Fourth Platoon comrades. Now, he was the first to rush to the top of the mountain. He saw the bodies of his comrades Ni Xiangming and Zhou Yuande lying together with the bodies of the enemy: Ni Xiangming was lying under a Japanese devil, his right arm still tightly clamping the neck of a Japanese devil, and another Japanese devil was dead on his back; Zhou Yuande was tightly strangling two Japanese devils, lying on the wet ground, the ears and noses of the Japanese devils were bitten to pieces, and their clothes were torn to shreds. He stood silently to pay the final tribute to the great comrades. When the soldiers all rushed up and stood in front of the bodies of their comrades, Zhang Wenju took the iron ring of the last grenade he had pulled from the fingers of Ni Xiangming's broken hand. The oath of "avenging the comrades" resounded through the heroic position.

    Later, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers awarded this platoon the honorary title of "First-Class Hero Platoon of Hill 222.9," and collectively recorded a special merit; and posthumously recognized Ni Xiangming as a special merit hero and "First-Class Combat Hero." The division Party committee also approved Ni Xiangming's great wish before his death - posthumously recognizing him as a member of the Communist Party of China. (Attached picture)

    英雄阵地和英雄班
    徐健民
    一    
    一清早，班长刘佐才从连部回来，飞也似地跑进四班的掩蔽部，气还没有喘定就向大家宣布：“同志们，批准了，就在今天晚上，我们接替七班，守卫二二二点九高地。”班长的话还没落地，全班同志就唰地站了起来，一个个高举着拳头，不约而同地宣起誓来：“为了党，为了毛主席，我们不怕任何牺牲，一定完成任务！”一会儿，党支部接到一张入党申请书：“请支部在这次战斗中考验我对党的事业的忠诚，如果我具备了党员的条件，希望吸收我入党。”下面的署名是“倪祥明”。
    这是一九五二年七月二十日。
    这块位置在朝鲜战场西线临津江南岸崇山峻岭中的高地，在三天以前被志愿军某部以六分钟的时间歼敌一百九十余名而第四次占领了，接着敌人又开始了绝望的反扑，争夺战正在激烈地进行着。
    整天浓云压着山头，好不容易天才擦黑。黄昏时的片刻沉静过去了，随着夜的降临，敌人的炮火又一阵紧似一阵，炮弹在我们主阵地和前沿阵地之间的山洼里和山坡上不停地爆炸着，燃起片片火焰。这时，整装待发，等了一整天的四班战士们，在排长石林和和班长刘佐才的率领下，一个个生龙活虎一样跃出了掩蔽部，迎着晚来的风雨，冒着敌人的炮火向前沿进发了。刚才特地来到掩蔽部交代任务的连长杨印山的微笑的脸和恳切的话，还在每个人的脑海里浮动，他们感到这是党和上级对自己的无限关切和期望，给他们增加了多少勇气和力量啊！
    他们踏过敌人炮火的封锁地区，踏过被炮火打成一片稀松粉末的山坡和山洼，终于来到了二二二点九高地。这里看不到一株草木，只有两棵布满像蜂窝一样弹痕的秃树桩；这里听不到一声虫叫，只有炸弹的轰响和子弹的狂啸；有的地方，连交通沟的痕迹都被轰得没有了。此情此景，更加激动着战士们复仇的心。在右侧伸出的小山爪上，在一个被炮火震破的防空洞里，他们和七班的战友会面了。交代情况，检点弹药，他们在送走坚守阵地三昼夜的七班战友以后，立即按照预定计划，开始抢修工事，准备抗击敌人的进攻。
    二
    在敌人的炮火下经过一昼夜的紧张劳动，四班完成了抗击敌人坚守阵地的准备工作，坑道修通了，带掩体的交通沟做好了。战士们兴奋地说：“已经有把握了，让野兽们来攻吧！”
    这是七月二十一日，夜幕笼罩着阵地，敌人还没有什么动静，天空漆黑，又一阵大一阵小地落起雨来。急风夹带着冷雨簌簌地旋进洞口。排长石林和和班长刘佐才深深地体会到，经过了紧张劳动的战士们的体力需要很好地恢复，那怕是片刻的睡眠，对同志们都是非常宝贵的，都会增加战斗的力量。这时正是激烈战斗前的沉静的时刻，是难得的机会。于是他们命令大家赶快休息，准备迎接战斗，同志们警惕地抱着武器，身上裹着被汗水和雨水弄得透湿的衣服，在湿漉漉的连一根草都没有的地上，互相偎依着开始休息了。石林和和刘佐才看着同志们睡着了，就打开了全班仅有的两件大衣给他们盖上，又和在洞门外放哨的周元德、葛方明一起，把打开盖的手榴弹箱一箱一箱地搬到工事和洞口的前面。然后石林和就抱着卡宾枪，脚蹬着对面洞口的墙，靠在右边的洞口上；刘佐才也和他取着一样的姿势，靠在左边的洞口上。他们在为洞里躺着的战士们挡住风雨。他们也瞌睡，但是一打盹，又惊醒了，他们不能安然地睡去，因为这里是时时刻刻都会有战斗发生的前哨阵地啊！他们还关心着洞门外的监视哨——不能够休息的周元德和葛方明。当他们听到沉沉入睡的战士们的鼾声的时候，心中感到了很大的安慰。
    洞里的战士都睡熟了，只有副班长倪祥明却醒着，他被刘佐才这个共产党员的坚强精神深深感动了。他——一个出生在河南贫农家庭的孩子，解放以前，所谓“河南四荒，水旱蝗汤”，没吃没穿，他随着父母沿门乞食，遭受过多少磨难啊！一解放，他就感到新社会的温暖；参加志愿军以后，更感到革命大家庭的温暖，但这种温暖的感觉，从来没有现在这样来得强烈，使他激动。他想起了战斗前在宣誓会上立下的誓言和入党申请书上写下的每一个字，他轻轻地移开靠在他身上的同志，他看着在洞口为同志们挡着风雨的排长和班长，他看着抢修工事弄得疲倦不堪的战士们睡得那样香甜，他觉得自己再也不能躺着了，坐起来，几乎连一点声响都没有，轻手轻脚地从躺着的同志们的腿脚的空隙里爬到洞口，对刘佐才说：“班长！让我来堵住洞口，你到里面去休息休息吧，我们都要靠你指挥打胜仗啊！”刘佐才为倪祥明的话激动着，他深深地体会到这种伟大的兄弟般的友情，可是他知道自己这时候不能休息，就对倪祥明说：“副班长，我不能休息，你好好带着战士们休息吧！准备力量粉碎敌人进攻啊！”倪祥明又从班长的身边爬到右边洞口排长的跟前，要替换排长休息，石林和也没有同意他的请求。这时候他又想起了在洞外放哨的周元德和葛方明。他想自己还有一套准备换着穿的干衣服，就迅速地把它取出来，又意外地找到了两块饼干。他高兴极了，立刻跑到被冷风吹着的工事里，把两块饼干送给葛方明吃了，又转到另一个洞口前找到了周元德，把干衣服塞到他的手里，轻声地对他说：“穿上吧！太冷了。”说着就顺手把周元德手里的枪接过来。
    这时候，夜雨停歇了，清凉的天空有几颗星星在云的空隙里眨眼，四周异常沉寂。只看到头顶上空拖着长长火尾、带着啸声的炮弹飞过去，在远处迸裂出火花。他和周元德并肩站着，冷风从他们身边吹过。周元德沉默了好久，最后才说：“副班长，我要用战斗的实际行动来回答你平日对我的关心和培养！”倪祥明微笑着对周元德说：“好！这正是我们争取荣誉的时候啊！”
    倪祥明回到洞里，把躺着的几个同志身上的大衣盖好，靠着洞壁，曲着身体坐着，沉沉欲睡。就在似睡非睡的时候，“轰！”洞门外突然响起一颗手榴弹的爆炸声，他迅速地爬起来，接着听到周元德的声音：“同志们，敌人来了。”班长刘佐才也喊：“同志们，赶快占领工事，消灭敌人！”“呼啦”一声所有睡着的同志都起来了，跟随着排长和班长冲出了洞口，迅速占领了白天做好的工事。
    三
    四班同志散开以后，敌人已经到了离工事只有十来公尺的地方了，正好展开火力消灭敌人。冲锋枪、机枪织成了火网，手榴弹、手雷在敌人群里一个接一个地腾起火花。敌人一阵被打下去，一阵又冲上来。战斗开始后，连的主阵地上支援的炮火，也密集地打向敌人来往的山坡上。敌人偷袭没有得逞，就硬攻，拚命地用炮火轰击四班的阵地，掩护他们的冲锋部队。轻机枪射手、共产党员王义腿上负了重伤，仍然不停地射击；右胳膊和脸上又负了伤，他还支起身体，咬着牙，忍着痛，用左手扔手榴弹。葛方明的左手和腿上也负了重伤，他就用牙齿咬开手榴弹的保险盖，用一只手坚持打。
    激烈的战斗不歇气地打了一个多钟头，密密地横躺竖卧在阵地前的鬼子的死尸已经有一百多具。在这个战斗的紧要关头，优秀的青年团员、排长石林和和战士傅显宗、吴永珍壮烈地牺牲了。班长刘佐才已经两次负伤了，可是他继续一面打一面指挥。他跟前的手榴弹打光了，就到洞口搬子弹箱，这时一块弹片又打中了他的头部。他第三次负了伤，血从他的头上流下来，糊住了他的眼睛，他还不知道，他用手抹了一把，说：“今天怎么出了这样多的汗！”话刚说完就昏倒在交通沟里了。
    这时候阵地上只有倪祥明、周元德和宋成久三个负轻伤的同志坚持战斗，指挥的重担就落在副班长倪祥明的肩上了。他们把负伤的班长和同志背进洞里。倪祥明亲眼看到他的战友们有的流了血，有的贡献出宝贵的青春生命，他已经没有眼泪了，仇恨的火焰在他的心中燃烧着。他把守备坑道口和保护伤员的任务交给了宋成久，自己在洞里搜寻着弹药，两手紧握着两颗手榴弹，从洞口里面观察着敌人的动静。这时候，忽然有五个鬼子的黑影闪动在洞口外的交通沟上，倪祥明赶忙对周元德说：“敌人来了，我们把它消灭掉！”说着就拿起手榴弹冲出洞口，向敌人直扑过去，五个鬼子马上扑过来抓他，倪祥明挥起手榴弹，狠狠地对着一个鬼子的胸部锤了过去，又伸出胳膊抓住了这个鬼子的衣襟，使劲一按，鬼子就脸磕着地栽倒了。另外四个鬼子乘机猛扑过来和倪祥明撕打成一团，周元德也冲上来支援副班长，使尽力气从副班长身上搬下两个鬼子。倪祥明又站了起来，抡起那铁锤似的手榴弹向着鬼子的脑袋拼命地打去。守卫在坑道里的宋成久，在炮弹爆炸的火光和照明弹的闪光里，把副班长、周元德和敌人搏斗的英雄情景看得清清楚楚，他想冲上去支援，但又不能放弃守卫坑道和负伤同志的任务。这时，又有五六个鬼子冲了上来。看到倪祥明跟周元德说了些什么，接着就听到倪祥明在大声叫喊：“宋成久，我要跟敌人拼了……”
    当鬼子们冲到倪祥明和周元德面前的时候，只听得倪祥明和周元德高喊：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”接着，就是四颗手榴弹的连续的轰响。鬼子有的被炸死，有的被吓得退了下去。
    四
    东方放射出黎明的曙光，晨风轻轻地吹过这块英雄的阵地，硝烟混合着朝雾，浮荡在没有一株草木的二二二点九高地上。
    一个佩带全副武装的志愿军战斗员，在烈士们牺牲的山头上伫立着。他是反击部队的突击班长张文举。二十日晚上，就是他把防务移交给四班的战友的。现在，他第一个冲上了山头。他看到战友倪祥明和周元德的尸体和敌人的尸体躺在一起：倪祥明身下压着一个鬼子，右胳膊还把一个鬼子的脖子紧紧地钳住，另一个鬼子死在他的背上；周元德紧紧地扼住两个鬼子，躺在湿地上，鬼子的耳朵和鼻子被咬得稀烂，衣服也被撕成了破片。他默默地立着向伟大的战友们致最后的敬礼。当战士们都冲上来，立在战友们的尸体前面的时候，张文举从倪祥明被炸断的手的指头上，取下了他拉响的最后一颗手榴弹的铁环。“为战友复仇”的誓言，响彻了英雄的阵地。
    以后，志愿军政治部授给这个班“二二二点九高地一级英雄班”的光荣称号，集体记特等功一次；并追认倪祥明为特等功臣、“一级战斗英雄”。师党委也批准了倪祥明生前的伟大志愿——追认他为中国共产党党员。（附图片）
    倪祥明又站了起来，抡起那铁锤似的手榴弹向着鬼子的脑袋拚命地打去。
