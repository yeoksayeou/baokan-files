(Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 15th) According to TASS, Budapest: A meeting of activists from the Budapest Party organization of the Hungarian Working People's Party was held on the 11th.

    The meeting first heard a report by Mátyás Rákosi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, on the resolutions of the recent plenary session of the Party Central Committee. Rákosi said that the resolutions of the Party Central Committee plenary session held at the end of June concerned many extremely important issues for the Party and the people's democratic regime. Rákosi first described the significant achievements made by the Working People's Party in leading the country's recovery and construction work since Hungary's liberation, and pointed out that these achievements were closely linked to the help and support of the powerful Soviet Union. Rákosi then said: However, the Central Committee of our Party believes that our Party, especially the leading organs of the Party, has made several serious mistakes in its past work. The mistakes we made were primarily in adopting too rapid a pace in developing heavy industry and the means of production sectors, and in formulating plans without paying attention to economic resources and our country's actual possibilities. More than once, we failed to recognize the enormous potential that would be generated by better organizing cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. But the most serious mistake we made was in February 1951, when we excessively raised the industrial targets in the Five-Year Plan. At that time, based on the summary of the first year's implementation of the Five-Year Plan, we believed that our economic potential was higher than we had initially estimated. Therefore, we increased the investment amount from 51 billion forints to 80 billion forints. According to the expanded plan, investments in heavy industry and machine manufacturing were ten times those in light industry and the food industry. The amount of investment in agriculture was very small.

    Rákosi pointed out: Part of the Party's mistakes stemmed from the Party's incorrect leadership methods. The Party Central Committee plenary session formulated some measures for this purpose to ensure genuine collective leadership in the future, to ensure the implementation of intra-Party democracy in leadership work—this is a necessary guarantee for the healthy development of our Party—and the spirit of communist criticism and self-criticism. What we must now be concerned with is that intra-Party democracy and sound criticism and self-criticism can be implemented throughout the life of the Party, from the Central Committee to the grassroots organizations; we must also be concerned with consolidating and strengthening the ties between the Party and the working masses. In order to correct these mistakes, the Party Central Committee plenary session also formulated some economic measures. The essence of these measures is that our future investments and plans should be re-examined and revised according to the following principles. That principle is: in the future, we must take into account as much as possible the need to improve the living standards of the working people and the working class; at the same time, we will continue to carry out socialist construction, although at a slower pace. We will also spend more funds to meet the social needs of workers and implement labor protection. We will reduce overtime to a minimum, guarantee rest days, and abolish improper fines.

    Rákosi, when talking about agriculture, said: A series of important measures have been taken in agriculture. One of the purposes of re-formulating our plan is to invest a large amount of funds in agriculture. We believe that the measures formulated by the Party Central Committee will not only improve the living standards of individual working peasants but also strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. Rákosi also said: At the same time, we must clearly and unequivocally point out that our Party and the people's democratic regime always consider production cooperatives as the path to socialist construction in the countryside, so we will do our best to develop and consolidate production cooperatives. There can be no change in this regard.

    Rákosi also talked about the international situation. He condemned the recent provocative activities of the imperialists against the peaceful and democratic camp and expressed the unanimous support of the Hungarian Working People's Party members for the resolute and swift measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to purge the international imperialist agent Beria. Rákosi said that we also draw the following conclusion from the Beria incident: we must be very vigilant, we must protect the unity of our Party like protecting our eyeballs, maintain the Party's collective leadership, and uphold the principles of unwavering Marxist-Leninist thought.

    Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nagy then spoke at the meeting. He pointed out: The resolution of the Party Central Committee plenary session is of great significance for strengthening the Party's ideological unity. He also pointed out that the resolution of the Party Central Committee plenary session places the worker-peasant alliance on a much broader foundation, consolidates relations with middle peasants, and thereby guarantees a more solid foundation for the people's democratic system.

    Finally, the meeting adopted a resolution saying: Budapest Party activists expressed their full support for the resolutions of the Party Central Committee plenary session and Comrade Rákosi's report. Party activists will take these resolutions and reports as the basis for all their future activities.

    在布达佩斯劳动人民党活动分子会议上拉科西报告党中央全会的决议
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党布达佩斯党组织的活动分子，曾在十一日举行会议。
    会议首先听取了劳动人民党中央委员会书记马加斯·拉科西的关于最近举行的党中央委员会全体会议的决议的报告。拉科西说：在六月底举行的党中央全体会议的决议，关涉到党和人民民主政权的许多极重要的问题。拉科西首先叙述了劳动人民党自匈牙利解放以来，在领导国家的恢复和建设工作方面所取得的重大成就，并指出这些成就的取得和强大苏联的帮助与支持的密切联系。拉科西接着说：但是，我们党的中央委员会认为，我们党，特别是党的领导机构，在过去工作中曾经犯过若干严重的错误。我们所犯的错误，首先是在发展重工业和生产资料部门方面采取了过快的速度，在制订计划时没有注意到经济的资源和我国的实际可能性。我们不止一次地没有注意到：把我国和苏联及人民民主国家之间的合作更好地组织起来，会产生怎样巨大的潜力。但是，我们犯的最严重的错误是：一九五一年二月，我们过分提高了五年计划中工业方面的任务。当时我们根据五年计划在第一年中执行情况的总结，认为我们的经济潜力比我们当初估计的要高。因此，我们把投资数目从五百一十亿福林提高到八百亿福林。按照扩大了的计划，重工业和机器制造工业的投资为轻工业和食品工业的十倍。农业投资数量很少。
    拉科西指出：党的一部分错误的产生，是由于党的不正确的领导方法。这次党中央全体会议为此制订了一些措施，来保证今后真正的集体领导，保证在领导工作中贯彻党内民主制度--这是我们党健全发展的必要保障--以及共产主义者的批评与自我批评精神。我们现在必须关心的是，党内民主制度和健全的批评与自我批评能够在从党中央到基层组织整个党的生活中贯彻实施；我们还必须关心和巩固加强党和劳动群众的联系。为了纠正这些错误，党中央委员会全体会议还制订了一些经济措施。这些措施的实质是，我们今后的投资和计划要根据下面的原则重新加以考虑和改订。这个原则就是：今后要尽可能照顾到提高劳动人民和工人阶级的生活水平；和这同时，我们仍将继续进行社会主义建设，虽然速度要慢一些。我们还要支出更多的资金，来满足工人的社会需要和实行劳动保护。我们将把额外工作时间减到最低限度，保证休息日，并取消不正当的罚金。
    拉科西在谈到农业的时候说：在农业方面已经采取了一系列重要的措施。重新制订我们计划的目的之一，就是要在农业方面投入大量的资金。我们相信，党中央委员会所制订的措施，不仅能提高个体劳动农民的生活水平，而且能够加强工农联盟。拉科西又说：和这同时，我们必须明确地、毫不含糊地指出，我们党和人民民主政权始终认为生产合作社是农村社会主义建设的道路，因此我们将尽力发展和巩固生产合作社。在这一方面不能有任何改变。
    拉科西还谈到了国际形势，他斥责了帝国主义者最近对和平民主阵营的挑衅活动，并且对于苏联共产党中央委员会坚决而迅速地清洗国际帝国主义代理人贝利亚的措施，表示了匈牙利劳动人民党党员的一致拥护。拉科西说，我们也从贝利亚事件中得出这样的结论：我们必须非常警惕，我们要像保护眼珠一样，保护我们党的团结一致，保持党的集体领导，维护坚定不移的马克思列宁主义思想的原则。
    部长会议主席纳吉接着在会上发言。他指出：党中央全体会议的决议，对于锻炼党的思想一致具有重大的意义。他还指出，党中央全体会议的决议把工农联盟放在更加广泛得多的基础上，巩固与中农的关系，从而保证人民民主制度有更加坚固的基础。
    最后，会议通过决议说：布达佩斯党活动分子表示完全拥护党中央全体会议的决议和拉科西同志的报告。党的活动分子将把这些决议和报告当作是自己今后全部活动的基础。
