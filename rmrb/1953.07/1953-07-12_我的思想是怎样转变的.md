My Thinking Transformed
    Spoken by Li Zhiping, Organized by Yun Zhiqiang and Ren Binglan

    Editor's Note: Li Zhiping, a female cloth inspector in the finishing section of the Tianjin State-owned Sixth Cotton Mill, used to frequently violate labor discipline and be absent without reason. During this rectification of labor discipline, with the help of her team and the education of the Communist Youth League branch, she realized her past mistakes and bravely corrected them, showing high enthusiasm for production. She spoke in detail about the process of her ideological transformation, which had a great impact on the broad masses of workers and promoted the development of criticism and self-criticism. Below is what she said:

    My name is Li Zhiping, and I am a cloth inspector in the finishing section of the Tianjin State-owned Sixth Cotton Mill. In the past, I constantly violated labor discipline. Sometimes, when things didn't go well at work, I would pretend to be sick and ask for leave. Even with a slight illness, I would take time off. After the "Three-Anti" campaign last year, a comrade in my section said a few words to me about work, and I got angry and went to the hospital, pretending to have stomach pains to get sick leave. Our factory works in three shifts every day, and I didn't like working the night shift because I couldn't sleep or eat well during the day. Every time it was my turn to work the night shift, I would ask for sick leave two days in advance. Sometimes, the doctor wouldn't give me a sick leave slip, so I would lie to the doctor, pretending to be very sick, saying my back hurt, my stomach hurt, and I had neuralgia, deliberately making things difficult for him and scaring him, so the doctor didn't know what was wrong with me and had to give me a sick leave slip. But after taking leave, even if I was really sick, I wasn't willing to rest at home; I would go wherever there was excitement. Last year during National Day, only eight days after giving birth, I ran to the department store entrance to watch the parade, which resulted in postpartum illness, and I was off work for several months.

    Why did I like to take time off so much in the past? The main reason was that there was something wrong with my thinking. I often thought that, since liberation, the working class was in charge, and living conditions had greatly improved. In the past, workers suffered and were looked down upon. Shouldn't we be free and enjoy ourselves now! Besides, since our factory implemented labor protection regulations, taking sick leave not only meant not worrying about being fired, but also getting labor insurance money. I've been working in the factory for seven years. When I was sick and took time off, the labor insurance money I received was only slightly less than my wages, and I could have fun after taking time off. Sometimes, although comrades came to my house to persuade me and help me, I would superficially agree, but in my heart, I found them annoying. I thought, I won't listen to your nonsense! My selfish ideas were really outrageous.

    At the end of February this year, not long after I returned to work, the factory discussed revising this year's production plan. One day, when the workshop director reported how to reduce costs, he said that in order to reduce costs, the wages for taking time off would also have to come out of the workshop's costs! He earnestly advised everyone, "In the past, we had many sick people in our workshop, which affected production and increased costs. In the future, we should take good care of our health and reduce absenteeism due to illness!" When I heard this, my face felt hot, and I was a little embarrassed. During group discussions, I wanted to confess that I had taken leave without reason, but then I thought, if I said that, people would know and say I was a backward element, so I swallowed the words back. A few days later, the labor competition was about to start, and each group was discussing how to increase attendance, ensure production, and reduce costs. But our group couldn't continue the discussion because some people said, "With Li Zhiping in our group, we can't make an attendance plan. She's dragging everyone down." When I heard this, I felt even more uncomfortable. I knew I was wrong, but I still refused to say what was on my mind. Just as I was feeling uneasy, the secretary of the Youth League branch and the accountant of the workshop came to talk to me. They advised me, "We workers are the masters of the country, we have to act like masters! Building the motherland depends on us!" A few words made my face turn red and white. I didn't say anything, but I was thinking to myself: when I first came to the factory, I often heard comrades say that during the Japanese occupation, workers would be fired if they got sick, and they had to sneak off to the toilet. If the Japanese happened to see them, they would be chased into the toilet and beaten and scolded. Now, the working class has become the leading class, and I no longer have to worry about food or clothing. If I get sick, I can enjoy labor protection benefits. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the people of the whole country in arduous struggle, and so many people shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, could I have the happiness I have today? Even today, the volunteers are still fighting the enemy in Korea, protecting us so that we can produce in peace and live a happy life. And I, on the other hand, am unwilling to work and only want to enjoy personal comfort. I have truly forgotten who dug the well after drinking the water, and forgotten the pain after the scar has healed. Furthermore, our country is about to begin large-scale economic construction this year. As long as we work hard in production, our lives will get better day by day. Take our factory as an example: in the past few years, we have built new workshops and repaired the club; the workers' toilets used to have only a few pits. In winter, going to the toilet would make people shiver with cold (we wear thin clothes in the workshop), and in summer, the stinking maggots would crawl all over the floor. The new toilets that were renovated last year have flush toilets, heating in winter, and ventilation in summer. It feels good to take a trip to the toilet. Large-scale construction is even more different. I heard that our country has built many new factories, and many workers and cadres from our factory have been transferred to new factories in other areas. If the country is built well, the lives of the workers will be even better. But if everyone is like me, only thinking about their own enjoyment and unwilling to work hard, how can the country be built well! Besides, I have applied to join the Youth League, I shouldn't lag behind, I shouldn't be greedy for personal enjoyment. The more I thought about it, the more I felt I was wrong. I had to make up my mind to correct my mistakes and participate in the construction of the motherland with everyone. Thinking of this, I mustered up the courage to talk about my mistakes.

    After talking about my mistakes, I felt extremely happy, but I was still worried that others would laugh at me for being backward. When I got to the workshop, I still felt very embarrassed. But the reality was just the opposite of what I thought. Not only did everyone not laugh at me, but they encouraged me, saying that it was good that I had recognized my mistakes, and advised me to work hard in the future, which really moved me. I didn't say anything at the time, but secretly put in a lot of effort. In March and April, I didn't ask for a day off, and I was able to concentrate on my work, fearing that I would delay even a minute of time, because I was in a good mood, and I didn't feel anything even when I had a small illness. In April, my output exceeded the competition plan I had set for myself, and the quality also met my plan, exceeding the administrative plan by a double. I guarantee to respond to the call of the Party and the trade union, and I will never be absent without reason. I will always fulfill and exceed the production plan.

    我的思想是怎样转变的
    李志苹口述  运志强  任丙兰整理
    编者按：天津国营第六棉纺织厂整理科验布女工李志苹，过去时常违犯劳动纪律，无故欠勤。在这次整顿劳动纪律过程中，经过本小组的帮助和团支部的教育，她认识到自己过去的错误，并且勇敢地改正了自己的错误，生产热情很高。她详细地谈出了她的思想转变的过程，在广大工人中起了很大影响，推动了批评和自我批评的开展。下面是她自己讲的话：
    我叫李志苹，是天津国营第六棉纺织厂整理科的验布工。在以前，我不断违犯劳动纪律，有时候，工作上不顺心，就装病请假，稍微有点小病也要歇工。去年“三反”以后，本科一个同志因为工作上的事，说了我几句，我一生气就跑到医院去，假装胃口疼请了病假。我们工厂每天分三班工作，我嫌上夜班白天睡不好、吃不好，每次轮到我上夜班的前两天，我就去请病假。有时候，医生不给我开请假条，我就对医生说瞎话，假说我病的很厉害，腰疼、胃口疼，又是神经疼，故意刁难他，吓唬他，弄得医生也不知道我到底害了什么病，只好给我开请假条。但是请假以后，就是真有病，我也不愿在家里好好休养，哪儿热闹就往哪儿跑。去年国庆节，我生小孩后才八天，就跑到百货公司门口去看游行，结果得了产后病，一直歇了好几个月。
    过去我为什么这样好歇班呢？主要是我的思想上有毛病。我常常想，解放了，工人阶级当家作主，生活也大大改善啦，在以前，工人受苦受罪，被人瞧不起，现在还不该自由自由，享受享受吗！再一说，从我们工厂实行了劳保条例，请病假，不但不用担心被开除，还能拿到劳保金。我在工厂干了七年啦，有病歇了班，拿的劳保金比工钱略略少一点，而且歇班后可以玩一玩。有时，虽说同志们也找到我家里劝导我，帮助我，我表面上也哼哼哈哈，心眼里反而觉得他们讨厌，我想我才不听你们那一套呢！我这种自私自利的想法，真是太不像话了。
    今年二月底，我上班不久，厂子里讨论修改今年的生产计划。有一天，车间主任报告怎样降低成本的时候，说到为了降低成本，以后歇班的工资也要出在车间成本里啦！他很恳切地劝告大家说：“以前咱们车间病号多，生产受影响，成本也增大啦，往后我们应当好好地保养身体，减少因病欠勤！”我一听，脸上觉得热辣辣的，有点不好意思。分组讨论时，我想把自己无故歇班的事检讨出来，又一想，这样一说别人知道了，会说我是落后分子，所以话到嘴边又咽了下去。过了几天，快要开展劳动竞赛了，各小组纷纷讨论怎样提高出勤率，保证生产，降低成本。可是我们小组里却讨论不下去，有的人说：“李志苹在我们小组，出勤计划就没法订，为她一个人，把大伙都拉下来了。”我听了，心里更难过，明知道自己不对了，仍旧不肯把心里的话说出来。正当我心里别扭得难受时，车间团支部书记和会计员来找我谈话了。他们劝我说：“咱们工人当了国家主人，可得像个主人的样子啊！建设祖国都靠咱们哩！”几句话，说得我脸上一阵红一阵白的。我嘴里没说话，心里却在暗暗地想：我才到工厂的时候，常听同志们说，日本鬼子统治的时候，工人们有了病就会被开除，上厕所都要偷着去，碰巧叫日本人看见了，就要赶到厕所里，又是打又是骂。现在呢，工人阶级成了领导阶级，我再也不愁吃不愁穿了，生了病还能享受劳保待遇，要不是共产党、毛主席领导全国人民坚苦斗争，多少人流血牺牲，我能有今天的幸福吗？就是今天，志愿军还在朝鲜和敌人战斗着，保护着我们能够安心生产，过着幸福的生活。而我呢，却不愿意干活，只贪图个人享受，真是吃水忘了掘井人，掉了疤忘了疼。再一说，我们国家从今年开始就要进行大经济建设了，我们只要努力生产，今后日子一天还会比一天好。就拿我们工厂来说：几年来我们盖了新工房、修了俱乐部；工人厕所，以前只有几个坑，冬天上厕所冻的人发抖（我们在车间穿的薄），夏天厕所里的臭蛆满地爬。去年改修的新厕所有抽水马桶，冬天有暖气，夏天能通风，走一趟厕所心里也痛快。大建设就更不同啦，我听说我们国家盖了许多新工厂，我们工厂里就有好多工友和干部调到其他地区的新厂子工作。国家建设好了，工人的生活就会更好了。可是人人都像我这样，只顾自己享受，不肯努力干活，国家怎么会建设好呢！再说我已经申请入团了，我不该掉队，不该贪图个人享受。我越想越觉得自己不对，我要下决心改正错误，和大伙一起参加祖国大建设。想到这些，我就鼓起勇气，谈出了自己的错误。
    我谈出了自己的错误以后，心里痛快极了，可是，还担心别人笑话我落后。到了车间里，仍旧觉得怪难为情的。可是事实和我想的恰恰相反，大伙不但没嘲笑我，反鼓励我说我认识了自己的错误是很好的，劝导我以后好好工作，真使我感动。我当时嘴里没说什么，暗里却蹩足了劲。在三、四月份，没有请过一天假，上班时也能够聚精会神地工作，唯恐耽误一分钟时间，因为精神愉快，有点小病也不觉得怎样了。四月份，我的产量超过了自己订的竞赛计划，质量也完成了自己的计划，超过行政计划一倍。我保证响应党和工会的号召，绝不无故欠勤，我要经常完成和超过生产计划。
