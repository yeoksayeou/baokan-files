    Strengthen the Party's Leadership over the Youth League According to the Characteristics of Youth
    -- Congratulations on the Success of the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League

    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the China New Democratic Youth League held its Second National Congress as our country began to enter a new period of planned economic construction. The congress fully discussed the tasks assigned to the Youth League by the Party in this new historical period, summarized the past work experience of the Youth League, stipulated the future work guidelines, revised the League Constitution, and re-elected the League Central Committee. Now it has successfully concluded.

    Since the establishment of the China New Democratic Youth League in 1949, this brave and vigorous contingent of advanced Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has served as a strong assistant and reserve force of the Party, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese revolutionary youth organizations. It has carried out active activities on various fronts and achieved many brilliant results. In the past four years, whether in the National Liberation War, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, various social reform works, the restoration of the national economy, or other daily work, the Youth League, under the leadership of the Party, has united the broad masses of youth and made great contributions. Thousands of heroes and models have emerged in the ranks of the Youth League; some of them have heroically sacrificed themselves in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, leaving behind immortal glorious examples, which will forever inspire Chinese youth to bravely advance. During these four years of great struggle, the Youth League has made great progress politically and organizationally, and now has nine million members and 380,000 branches. Based on the great achievements of the past four years, in the future period of planned economic construction in our great motherland, the Youth League will inevitably further play its role as a shock force.

    In its congratulatory message to the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League on April 11, 1949, the Party Central Committee pointed out: "Past and present experiences have proved that the Youth League is a valuable assistant and reserve force of the Party. We believe that the New Democratic Youth League, with a broad foundation and good leadership, will surely be able to unite all patriotic working youth and intellectual youth in the great work of building a new China, disseminate Marxism-Leninism among the youth, and lead the youth with the spirit of a shock force, bravely completing their tasks under the leadership of the Party and the state." Recently, at the opening of the Second National Congress of the Youth League, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message stating: "The Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong are extremely concerned about and attach great importance to the work of the Youth League, its growth, its role as an assistant and reserve force of the Party, and its achievements in uniting the youth of the country to participate in the construction of the motherland." Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "The new historical period of our motherland has put forward new historical tasks before the people of the whole country, that is, to gradually realize the industrialization of the country and, on this basis, gradually transition our motherland from New Democracy to Socialism. As an assistant and reserve force of the Party, all members of the China New Democratic Youth League must stand together with the Party at the forefront of the struggle for national industrialization. Youth League members should actively participate in the various constructions of the motherland in their different positions, promote their own initiative and creativity, and play a leading and exemplary role among the young masses in China."

    Only under the leadership of the Party can the Youth League play its great role as an assistant and reserve force of the Party, and can it become the core organization for uniting the youth of the country. This is a truth proven by countless experiences. Any tendency to deviate from the leadership of the Party will bring serious losses to the work. This is one aspect. But on the other hand, since the Youth League is the core organization for the Party to unite the broad masses of youth in the country, it must adapt to the special requirements of youth and carry out its own series of independent activities. If the particularity of the Youth League is obliterated, its due organizational work is cancelled, and the activities of the Youth League become stagnant, this is of course also very wrong. The Party's leadership over the Youth League must prevent the above two tendencies. That is to say, the Youth League organization should learn to vividly carry out its own activities according to the characteristics of youth, and not limit itself to a narrow circle, thus hindering its contact with the broadest masses of youth; at the same time, the Party organization should also learn to specifically lead the work of the Youth League according to the characteristics of youth, and not only pay attention to use without paying attention to education, only care about assigning a few cadres of the League to participate in the general work of the Party and leave the entire organization of the League aside. When leading the Youth League, Party organizations at all levels must appropriately respect the organizational system of the Youth League.

    The correct method of the Party's leadership over the Youth League should be to adopt various methods suitable for the needs of youth work according to the characteristics of youth, instead of mechanically copying all the working methods of the Party to help the Youth League establish its own work. The Youth League should participate in the central work and serve the central work; but in addition to this, it must also have its own regular work, and must organize young people's learning, cultural entertainment and sports activities. The Party must pay close attention to the learning and health of young people when guiding the work of the Youth League, because this is the key issue in cultivating young people. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us to make young people "good in health, good in study, and good in work." That is to say, only when young people are healthy and knowledgeable can they better work for the motherland. If in their youth, they are physically weak and lacking in knowledge, they will certainly not be able to become complete talents in the future, and they will certainly not be able to shoulder the great task of national construction. The Youth League organizations at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party, earnestly strive to improve the health and knowledge of young people, and with this as the goal, actively cultivate young people's serious and lively style and excellent qualities of loyalty to the people's cause. The style of the Youth League must be serious, which refers to its principles, discipline, and organization; it refers to the spirit of daring to criticize and self-criticize all bad phenomena that harm the interests of the people and the revolutionary cause. But at the same time, the style of the Youth League must be lively, which refers to its vitality and courageous spirit of creation; it refers to the lively vigor that is neither frivolous nor old-fashioned. This lively and vigorous style and the serious moral character of being loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the cause of the Party are unified, which constitutes the main characteristics of the revolutionary youth of our era. We must lead the broad masses of youth on the industrial and agricultural production front, on the national defense front, in schools, institutions, and organizations in their studies and work, in various practical work positions, to overcome all difficulties, master Marxism-Leninism, master science and technology, learn various practical skills, and strengthen their bodies, so as to serve the motherland and the people with full energy.

    We congratulate the complete success of the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League. We congratulate all Youth League members on closely connecting and uniting the broad masses of youth throughout the country during the period of national planned economic construction, standing at the forefront of the motherland's construction under the great banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and making more and greater creative contributions with a heroic and striving spirit. We congratulate all young comrades on being good in health, good in study, and good in work.

    按照青年的特点，加强党对青年团的领导
    ——祝贺中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会的成功
    中国新民主主义青年团在我们的祖国开始进入有计划的经济建设的新时期，在党中央的领导下举行了第二次全国代表大会。大会充分地讨论了党在这个新的历史时期所提交给青年团的任务，总结了青年团过去的工作经验，规定了今后的工作方针，修改了团章，改选了团中央委员会，现在胜利地闭幕了。
    从一九四九年中国新民主主义青年团成立的那一天起，这一支勇敢的、生气勃勃的中国先进青年的队伍，就在中国共产党的领导下，作为党的有力的助手和后备军，继承和发扬着中国革命青年组织的光荣传统，在各种战线上展开了积极的活动，得到了许多光辉的成绩。四年来无论在全国解放战争、抗美援朝斗争、各种社会改革工作、国民经济的恢复工作以及其他日常的工作中，青年团在党的领导下都团结了广大的青年，作了巨大的贡献。在青年团的队伍里出现了成千的英雄模范；其中有的已经在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中英勇牺牲了，留下了永垂不朽的光荣榜样，永远鼓舞着中国青年奋勇前进。在这伟大斗争的四年间，青年团在政治上和组织上都有了很大的进步，现在已经拥有九百万团员，三十八万个支部。在过去四年的重大成就的基础上，今后在我们伟大祖国有计划的经济建设时期中，青年团必然会进一步发挥它的突击队的作用。
    党中央在一九四九年四月十一日给新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会的祝词中就已指出：“过去和现在的经验都证明，青年团是党的有价值的助手和后备军。我们相信有广泛基础和良好领导的新民主主义青年团，在今后建设新中国的伟大工作中，必能团结全体爱国的劳动青年和知识青年，在青年中传布马克思列宁主义，并以突击队的精神率领青年，在党和国家的领导下，勇敢地完成自己的任务。”最近在青年团第二次全国代表大会开会时，刘少奇同志代表党中央致祝词中说：“中国共产党和它的伟大领袖毛泽东同志极为关怀和重视青年团的工作以及它的成长、它的作为党的助手和后备军的作用、它在团结全国青年参加祖国建设事业中所获得的成就。”刘少奇同志指出：“我们祖国的新的历史时期在全国人民面前提出了新的历史任务，这就是逐步地实现国家的工业化并在这个基础上使我们祖国由新民主主义逐步地过渡到社会主义。作为党的助手和后备军，中国新民主主义青年团的全体团员就要和党一起，站到为国家工业化而斗争的最前列。青年团员要在自己的不同岗位上积极地参加祖国的各种建设，发扬自己的积极性和创造性，并在中国青年群众中起带头的和模范的作用。”
    只有在党的领导下，青年团才能发挥它作为党的助手和后备军的伟大作用，才能成为团结全国青年的核心组织，这是无数经验所证明了的真理。任何脱离党的领导的倾向都会给工作带来严重的损失。这是一方面。但在另一方面，青年团既然是党团结全国广大青年群众的核心组织，它就必然要适应青年的特殊要求，进行它自己的一系列的独立活动。如果抹杀青年团的特殊性，取消它应有的组织工作，使青年团的活动呆滞起来，这当然也是非常错误的。党对于青年团的领导，必须防止上述的两种倾向。这就是说，青年团组织应当学会按照青年的特点去生动地展开自己的活动，不把自己限制在狭隘的圈子里因而妨碍自己和最广大青年群众的联系；同时，党的组织也应当学会按照青年的特点去具体地领导青年团的工作，不要只顾使用而不顾教育，只顾分配团的少数干部去参加党的一般工作而把团的整个组织丢在一旁。党的各级组织在领导青年团时，必须适当地尊重青年团的组织系统。
    党对青年团的正确领导方法，应当是根据青年的特点，采取适合于青年工作需要的各种方式，而不是机械地搬用党的一切工作方式，去帮助青年团建立它自己的工作。青年团应该参加中心工作，为中心工作服务；但是，除此以外，它还必须有自己的经常工作，必须组织青年的学习、文化娱乐和体育活动。党在指导青年团的工作时必须十分注意青年的学习和健康，因为这是培养青年的关键问题。毛泽东同志指示我们要使青年们“身体好，学习好，工作好”。这就是说，只有青年们身体健康，知识增长，才能更好地为祖国工作。如果在青年时期，身体衰弱，知识贫乏，将来就一定不能成为完备的人材，就一定不能担负国家建设的伟大任务。青年团的各级组织必须在党的领导下，切实为增进青年们的健康和知识而努力，并以此为目标，积极培养青年们严肃活泼的作风和忠于人民事业的优良品质。青年团的作风必须是严肃的，这是指的它的原则性、纪律性、组织性；这是指的对于一切损害人民利益和革命事业的不良现象敢于进行批评和自我批评的精神。但同时青年团的作风又必须是活泼的，这是指的它的富有生命力、有勇敢的创造精神；这是指的既不举止轻浮、又不老气横秋的生动朝气。这种生动活泼的作风和忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于党的事业的严肃的道德品质统一起来，就构成了我们时代的革命青年的主要特点。我们必须在工业和农业的生产战线上，在国防战线上，在学校、机关、团体的学习和工作中，在各种实际工作岗位上，领导广大青年，克服一切困难，掌握马克思列宁主义，掌握科学技术，学会各种实际的本领，并且炼好身体，以便充满精力地为祖国和人民服务。
    我们祝贺中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会圆满的成功。我们祝贺全体青年团员在国家有计划的经济建设时期中，紧密地联系和团结全国广大青年群众，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的伟大旗帜下，站到祖国建设的最前列，以英勇奋发的精神，做出更多更大的富有创造性的贡献。我们祝贺全体青年同志们身体好，学习好，工作好。
