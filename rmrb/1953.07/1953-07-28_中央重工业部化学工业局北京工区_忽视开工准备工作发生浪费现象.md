Central Heavy Industry Ministry Chemical Industry Bureau Beijing Construction Area
Neglects Preparatory Work for Commencement, Resulting in Waste

The main building projects for the Chemical Industry School and Design Company, planned to be constructed in the Beijing area this year by the Central Heavy Industry Ministry Chemical Industry Bureau, have not yet commenced. The Heavy Industry Ministry sent personnel to inspect and found that the preparatory work at these two construction sites was very poor. The Chemical Industry School construction site was originally scheduled to commence in early May, but as of June 21st, the required amount of power for the site had not been calculated. No date had been set for when to install the transformer and erect the external lines, and the water source relied solely on three old wells, which would be insufficient once construction began. Regarding on-site transportation, not a single rail for the narrow-gauge railway had been delivered, and other transportation equipment was still awaiting shipment in Taiyuan. Construction equipment, such as mixers, had not yet arrived, and no one was responsible for resolving how to handle hoists and construction water pumps. Other work, such as temporary projects, was also inadequately prepared. Under these circumstances, even if construction were hastily commenced, there would still be a significant risk of work stoppages and idle labor in the short term.

Even though these two construction sites have not commenced, waste has already occurred. For example, at the Chemical Industry School construction site, more than 500 tons of cement were transported to the site at the beginning of the year and placed in temporary warehouses made of reed mats, with no drainage ditches around them. Rising dampness affected the quality of the cement. The waste of materials in the temporary dormitory frameworks at both construction sites resulted in costs exceeding 400,000 yuan per square meter. Improper location of material storage areas at the construction sites also caused significant waste.

The reason these two construction sites are experiencing this phenomenon of no one taking responsibility is mainly due to the bureaucratic attitude of the bureau's leadership towards these projects. After it was determined in the first quarter that these two projects would be contracted to the bureau's Beijing Engineering Office, the relationship between Party A and Party B has remained unclear. For example, when Party A sent more than 500 tons of cement to the Chemical Industry School construction site, it urged Party B to rush the construction of temporary warehouses, but Party B stated that it was not responsible for the materials, allowing the cement to sit outdoors for many days before temporarily covering it with reed mats. Currently, although Party A, Party B, and the bureau's Capital Construction Department have weekly coordination meetings three times a week, it is unclear which party or person is specifically responsible for handling the above-mentioned preparatory work.

The Central Heavy Industry Ministry Chemical Industry School main building project must be completed before October, otherwise it will affect the school's opening and delay the 1953 plan to train technical cadres. To this end, the Heavy Industry Ministry has specifically stipulated that the bureau designate one of the bureau chiefs or deputy bureau chiefs to personally take charge and immediately conduct a thorough inspection of the construction preparation situation in the Beijing area, clarifying the responsibilities of Party A and Party B, so that specific problems are handled by designated personnel; and to complete the preparatory work for the main building commencement before July 5th, and to complete this project on schedule while ensuring the quality of the project.

### 中央重工业部化学工业局北京工区  忽视开工准备工作发生浪费现象

    中央重工业部化学工业局北京工区
    忽视开工准备工作发生浪费现象
    中央重工业部化学工业管理局本年拟在北京地区修建的化学工业学校与设计公司的主楼工程，至今仍未开工。重工业部派人检查，发现这两个工地的准备工作做得很差。化学工业学校工地，原订五月初开工，但至六月二十一日，现场主要的动力电源用量多少，尚未计算好。何时安装变压器和架设外线，也没有规定日期，水源仅靠旧水井三口，一旦开工，水量将不敷应用。至于场内交通，轻便铁道的铁轨一根也未运到，其它运输工具还在太原待运。施工设备，如搅拌机迄今未到，卷扬机及施工用的水泵如何解决，均无人负责。其他如临时工程等工作，也准备不足。在这样情况之下，即使仓促开工，短期内仍有大量停工和窝工的危险。
    这两个工地，虽未开工，浪费现象却已经产生。例如化学工业学校工地，在今年年初运到现场的水泥五百余吨，放置在用芦席盖成的临时仓库里，四周无排水沟，潮气上升，影响了水泥的质量。两个工地的临时宿舍的房架的用料浪费，造价达每平方公尺四十万元以上。工地材料堆积地点不适当，也造成很大的浪费。
    这两个工地所以会发生这种无人负责现象，主要是因为该局领导方面以官僚主义态度对待该项工程。从第一季度确定将这两件工程发包给该局北京工程处后，甲乙双方关系始终不明确。譬如甲方将五百余吨水泥送到化学工业学校工地时，催乙方赶造临时仓库，但乙方表示不管材料，任凭水泥露天搁置多日，才以芦席临时盖起。目前甲、乙方和该局基本建设处虽然每周有三次碰头会，但对以上所述各项准备工作，到底应由何方、何人具体负责办理，均不明确。
    该局化学工业学校主楼工程，必须在十月以前完成，否则将影响学校开课，推迟一九五三年培养技术干部的计划。为此，重工业部特规定该局指定由局长或副局长一人亲自负责，立即对北京地区工程准备情况进行深入的检查，明确甲、乙双方职责，使得一切具体问题都有专人负责解决；并限于七月五日以前完成主楼开工准备工作，在保证工程质量的要求下，按期完成此项工程。
