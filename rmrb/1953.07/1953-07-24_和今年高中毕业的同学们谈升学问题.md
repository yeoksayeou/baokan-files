Comrades graduating from high school across the country:

As our great motherland begins to enter a new period of planned economic construction, you are graduating from senior high school. In this new historical period, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward new historical tasks to the people of the whole country, that is, to strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society. Chairman Mao taught us in his book "On Coalition Government": "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." In order to accomplish this great and glorious historical task, our country needs to cultivate tens of thousands of talents who are loyal to the people's revolutionary cause and possess modern scientific knowledge and technology.

According to the needs of national construction, it is initially determined in this year's higher education plan to recruit 70,000 new students to enter universities and colleges. Among the 70,000 students to be recruited, the proportions of each discipline are: engineering 29,600, accounting for 42.3 percent of the total; teacher training 18,300, accounting for 26.1 percent of the total; health 7,200, accounting for 10.3 percent of the total; science 4,500, accounting for 6.4 percent of the total; agriculture and forestry 3,200, accounting for 4.6 percent of the total; liberal arts 3,000, accounting for 4.3 percent of the total; finance and economics 2,000, accounting for 2.9 percent of the total; politics and law 1,100 (including 100 studying diplomacy), accounting for 1.6 percent of the total; physical education 800, accounting for 1.1 percent of the total; and art 300, accounting for 0.4 percent of the total.

From the above figures, we can see the approximate proportion of specialized talents needed in various construction undertakings of our country. Our cadre training plan serves the overall task of economic construction and the gradual realization of national industrialization, focusing on the training of technical cadres for industry, mining, and transportation. However, the focused development of higher education to adapt to the overall task of gradually realizing national industrialization does not mean that non-priority areas can be ignored. It would be wrong to think so. We must exert all our strength to strive for the full realization of the national plan for training various types of construction cadres.

As for the possible sources of students, the largest proportion is accounted for by this year's high school graduates (including students in spring semester classes who have completed five semesters and are allowed to graduate early), accounting for about 54,000 people. This is a new and huge force in the future construction of the motherland, and it is the main source of our country's training of various types of construction talents. The second is graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools; in addition, there are also cadres transferred from their posts and some outstanding primary school teachers, graduates of secondary normal and secondary technical schools approved to enter higher education, overseas Chinese students returning to study, and young people from society, totaling more than 20,000 people.

From the above situation, it seems that this year's enrollment task is large and the source of candidates is small; the country's need for various types of construction cadres is also very urgent, so the expectations for candidates are also very high; and how candidates can carry forward the spirit of patriotism, correct their attitude towards further education, actively prepare conditions, and strive to meet this year's further education task is one of the important keys to ensuring the successful completion of this year's enrollment plan.

Now I would like to talk to the students about the following issues related to further education:

I. On this year's enrollment policy and requirements for candidates

First, due to the small number of students and the imbalance between the enrollment tasks of universities and colleges in major administrative regions and the student sources in each region, it is still necessary to conduct unified enrollment on a national scale this year. On the one hand, the Enrollment Committee will formulate unified plans, unified organization and leadership, unified application, and unified admission and allocation; on the other hand, candidates will register on a unified date, take exams with unified test questions, and be admitted to school according to unified principles.

Second, under the unified principles, different admission standards will be set to take into account the requirements and characteristics of different schools and departments. In terms of academic level, generally speaking, all eight common examination subjects must reach a certain level; those applying for liberal arts and law subjects need a better foundation in Chinese language and social sciences, while those applying for science and engineering subjects must have considerable basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In terms of health conditions, the main requirement is that it does not affect their learning in various departments. For example, those with abnormal vocal organs are not suitable for applying to the vocal music department of the art subject; those with color blindness are not suitable for applying to the chemistry or biology department of the science subject.

Third, pay attention to quality so that qualified new students can smoothly carry out their studies after entering universities and colleges. The so-called quality includes political quality, health conditions, and academic level.

In terms of political quality, we must earnestly implement the educational policy of universities and colleges opening their doors to worker-peasant youths, first of all, we must do a good job in this year's first batch of worker-peasant rapid middle school graduates entering universities and colleges, and we must pay special attention to absorbing industrial workers and revolutionary cadres into schools to train them to become the backbone of national construction.

In terms of health conditions, attention should be paid to physical examinations. The learning tasks of universities and colleges are intensive and heavy, which requires candidates to have a sound physique and abundant energy. Facts have proved that some students with serious diseases who entered school last year not only failed to study according to plan, but also worsened their health, and had to stop studying halfway, which affected the country's plan to train various types of construction talents. This is harmful to both oneself and the country. Therefore, students who are temporarily unsuitable for applying to universities and colleges due to health conditions should avoid being impatient, and should not have pessimistic or disappointed emotions, but should patiently recuperate and strive to recover their health as soon as possible. The doors of universities and colleges are open to you.

In order to improve teaching quality, the admission standards will be appropriately raised this year in terms of academic level. This requires students to actively make full preparations before the exam. Some students think: "It doesn't matter whether I review or not, the country won't abandon me anyway!" This kind of passive waiting is wrong. However, the so-called appropriately raising the admission standards is not an unrealistic increase; when setting the questions for each subject, we will try our best to take into account the teaching progress and characteristics of senior high schools in various regions of the country, and appropriately take care of them. This year, in the examinations of eight subjects including political common sense, native language, Chinese and foreign history and geography, foreign language (Russian or English), mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, we will take into account the depth and difficulty of the test questions of each subject. Some senior high schools in some regions have not taught analytic geometry at all, so this subject will not be tested this year for the time being. Some students feel overly nervous and uneasy when they hear that the admission standards will be raised, and even have some pessimistic and depressed emotions, which is completely unnecessary.

II. Opinions on Choosing Schools and Departments

On this issue, students have various ideas, and some ideas are not realistic. According to our understanding, most students will apply for engineering subjects this year in terms of the choice of department. Young students are inspired by the lofty ideal of national industrialization and are eager to become specialists in this field in order to better contribute their strength to the motherland. This desire and mood are completely understandable and worthy of encouragement; however, it cannot be denied that some students lack a comprehensive and correct understanding of the complexity and arduousness of national economic construction. We know that industrial construction cannot and cannot be opposed to other constructions, it needs the organic cooperation of all aspects. For example, in order to adapt to the needs of the development of universities and colleges, we must attach importance to the training of middle school teachers; in order to improve the health of the working people so as to better serve the construction of the motherland, we need to train medical and health cadres; in order to train teachers for universities and colleges and researchers for scientific research institutions, students need to study science; in order to ensure the sufficient supply of industrial raw materials and commodity grain, students need to study agriculture and forestry; at the same time, our country's economic construction is multifaceted, and the talents needed are also multifaceted, so there must also be a certain number of students to study Chinese, finance and economics, politics and law, physical education, art, and other subjects. In short, all the subjects stipulated in the enrollment plan are the talents that are urgently needed in the national construction plan. The departments themselves are not important or unimportant, but only the proportion they occupy in the national economic construction plan is different. Some students think that only studying engineering can realize their ambitions, and studying other subjects is a "waste of youth." This idea is obviously incorrect and harmful. Some students want to study medicine in order to "be a doctor, wear white clothes and look cool, have a good reputation, get a lot of salary, others come to me when they are sick, I don't go to others." This kind of further education idea that takes personal reputation, treatment, and status as the starting point is the legacy of the capitalist "fame and profit point of view" and should also be criticized. If students are infected with this kind of bad thought, they cannot talk about the lofty ambition of serving the people.

So, what is the correct further education idea?

I think the correct further education idea should be to first select department volunteers carefully based on the needs of the country, combined with personal interests and specific conditions. For example, if a student has a good foundation in Chinese language and is conducive to developing in the direction of liberal arts, they are suitable for applying to liberal arts; if a student has a good foundation in mathematics, physics, and chemistry and is conducive to developing in the direction of science and engineering, they are suitable for applying to science and engineering. Anyone who does not consider their own conditions (mainly health conditions and academic level) and applies for some "popular" departments in order to "catch up with the trend," or applies for some "unpopular" departments in order to covet ease, is not a realistic attitude, and may not be able to fully exert their wisdom and talent in the future. At the same time, it should be explained that because students' choices of departments cannot be 100% in line with the needs of the country, it is inevitable that a small number of students will be assigned to departments different from their own volunteers during admission.

In the choice of school volunteers, most students are only willing to apply for a few famous schools and are not very willing to apply for some less famous schools. Generally speaking, some famous schools are superior to other schools in terms of teaching equipment and teacher allocation, but the distance between the two will not be too different. Facts have proved that after a series of rectification, restoration, and reform work in the past three years, the face of universities and colleges across the country has been renewed. Many schools that were poorly equipped and poorly managed in the past have been greatly improved. In the future, with the rapid development of national construction and the urgent need for various types of construction cadres, the government will gradually enrich the teachers and equipment of universities and colleges and strengthen administrative management. Therefore, students do not need to consider too much in the choice of school volunteers. To make oneself a specialist in a certain field, the learning environment (that is, the school) has a certain impact, but the key to determining personal success or failure and the size of contribution to the motherland mainly depends on one's own efforts. Students! With the rapid development of national economic construction, our motherland has opened up unlimited bright and broad prospects for every young person. As long as you work hard, you don't have to worry about not having a "place to use your skills."

In the choice of region, some students also consider it more. Is it better to be in a big city or a small city? Is it better to be in this region or another region? Due to the different specific situations of each person, each person's ideas are also different. I think, if students are really studying for the construction of the great motherland, rather than for the prosperity or material enjoyment of big cities, then there should not be much difference between big cities or small cities, this region or another region. Because the students' volunteers cannot be completely consistent with the national enrollment plan, especially because the enrollment tasks of universities and colleges in various places are not balanced with the sources of students in each region, it is necessary and inevitable to transfer students in terms of region during admission. When we carry out this work, we will avoid unnecessary two-region exchanges and try our best to be reasonable and fair in order to take care of the students' living conditions so that their studies are not affected.

III. A Few Hopes for Students

First, the enrollment work of universities and colleges is related to the implementation of the national plan for training various types of construction talents, and it is a very important and arduous task. In order to do this work well, in addition to the fact that the various organizations of the National University and College Enrollment Committee must do their best to do all the preparatory work, it is also hoped that the students will give full play to the spirit of patriotism and take the initiative to cooperate to ensure the successful completion of the enrollment task.

Second, in order for students to smoothly enter universities and colleges to study, the main thing is of course to rely on daily efforts, but it is also very necessary to review in a planned way before the exam. Recently, I heard that some students "burn the midnight oil" every day for the further education exam, and when they are physically exhausted, they "apply cooling oil" or "pinch their thighs," which has led to neurasthenia, indigestion, and other diseases. This situation is very bad and should arouse the serious attention of the students. Only by arranging one's learning and rest time reasonably and actively engaging in cultural, recreational, and sports activities can one improve learning efficiency and is the proper way to prepare for the further education exam. If one's body is broken down due to desperately catching up with homework, one may lose the opportunity to take the exam or be unable to shoulder future learning tasks.

Students! I hope you will firmly remember Chairman Mao's concern for you: not only should you study hard, but also exercise well. I wish you success in the entrance exam!

    和今年高中毕业的同学们谈升学问题
    全国高等学校招生委员会副主任委员  曾昭抡全国高中毕业的同学们：
    当伟大祖国开始进入国民经济的有计划建设的新时期，你们从高级中学毕业了。在这个新的历史时期中，中共中央向全国人民提出了新的历史任务，这就是为逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。毛主席在“论联合政府”一书中教导我们说：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”为了完成这个伟大的光荣的历史任务，我们的国家需要培养出成千成万忠实于人民革命事业的、具有现代科学知识和技术的人才。
    根据国家建设的需要，今年高等教育事业计划中初步确定要招收七万名新生进入高等学校学习。在招收的七万人中，各科的比例是：工科二万九千六百人，占总数百分之四十二点三；师范一万八千三百人，占总数百分之二十六点一；卫生七千二百人，占总数百分之十点三；理科四千五百人，占总数百分之六点四；农林三千二百人，占总数百分之四点六；文科三千人，占总数百分之四点三；财经二千人，占总数百分之二点九；政法一千一百人
    （包括学外交的一百人），占总数百分之一点六；体育八百人，占总数百分之一点一；艺术三百人，占总数百分之零点四。
    从以上的数字中可以看出我们国家各项建设事业需要专门人才的大致比例。我们的干部培养计划是服务于经济建设、服务于逐步实现国家工业化的总任务的，是以培养工矿交通技术干部为重点的；但是高等教育事业为着适应逐步实现国家工业化的总任务而有重点发展，并不是说非重点就可以不去注意，这样设想是错误的。我们要发挥一切力量，争取国家培养各类建设干部计划的全部实现。
    至于学生的可能来源，以本年高中毕业生（包括修业已满五学期准予提前毕业的春季始业班学生）占的比例最大，约有五万四千余人。这是祖国未来建设上一支新的巨大的力量，是我们国家培养各类建设人才的主要泉源。其次是工农速成中学毕业生；此外还有抽调的在职干部与一部分优秀小学教师，批准升学的中等师范和中等技术学校毕业生，归国升学的华侨学生及社会青年等，一共约有两万余人。
    从上面所讲的情况看来，今年招生的任务大而考生的来源少；国家对各类建设干部的需要又非常急迫，所以对投考青年的期望也是很大的；而投考青年如何发扬爱国主义的精神，端正升学态度，积极准备条件，为迎接今年的升学任务而努力，这是保证今年招生计划胜利完成的重要关键之一。
    现在我想和同学们来谈谈下面几个有关升学的问题：
     一、关于今年招生的方针和对考生的要求
    第一、由于学生来源少和各大行政区高等学校招生任务与各该区学生来源不平衡，今年仍然需要进行全国规模的统一招生。一方面，由招生委员会规定统一的计划，统一的组织领导，统一的报考，统
    一的录取调配；另一方面，投考学生将在统一的日期报名，用统一的试题考试，根据统一的原则录取入学。
    第二、在统一的原则下，将照顾不同学校不同系科的要求与特点，规定不同的录取标准。在文化程度方面，一般来说，八门共同考试科目均需达到一定的水平；而投考文、法科者在语文及社会科学方面需要较好的基础，投考理工科者则必须具有相当的数理化基础知识。在健康条件方面，主要要求不影响其对各系科的学习。例如：发音器官不正常者，不适宜于报考艺术科的声乐系；患色盲者，不适宜于投考理科中的化学系、生物系等。
    第三、注意质量，使合格的新生进入高等学校后能顺利地进行学习。所谓质量，包括政治质量、健康条件和文化程度三个方面。
    在政治质量方面，要切实贯彻高等学校向工农青年开门的教育方针，首先要办好今年第一届工农速成中学毕业生升入高等学校的工作，并要特别注意吸收产业工人和革命干部入学，培养他们成为国家建设的骨干。
    在健康条件方面，要注意体格检查。高等学校的学习任务是紧张而繁重的，这就要求考生具有健全的体魄和充沛的精力。事实证明，去年有些带有严重疾病的学生入校以后，不但不能按照计划进行学习，反而使自己的健康情况更加恶化，不得不中途停止学习，这便影响了国家培养各类建设人才的计划。这是对自己对国家都是有损无益的。所以，在健康条件上凡暂不适宜于报考高等学校的同学们，切忌急躁，更不宜有悲观失望的情绪，而应耐心休养，争取早日恢复健康。高等学校的大门是为你们敞开着的。
    为提高教学质量，在文化程度方面，今年将适当提高录取标准。这就要求同学们在考试之前积极地作好充分的准备。有的同学认为：“温课不温课没关系，反正国家不会不要我！”这种消极等待的思想是错误的。但是所谓适当地提高录取标准，并不是脱离实际的提高；在各科命题时，我们将尽量考虑到全国各地区高级中学教学的进度与特点，适当加以照顾。今年，在政治常识、本国语文、中外史地、外国语文（俄语或英语）、数学、物理、化学、生物等八门科目的考试中，将兼顾到各科试题的深浅难易。有些地区的高级中学根本没有教过解析几何，因此这一科目今年暂不予考试。有些同学听到要提高录取标准，精神过分紧张，心里很不安，甚至产生一些悲观、忧郁的情绪，这是大可不必的。
        二、关于选择学校和系科志愿的意见
    在这一个问题上，同学们的想法是多种多样的，有些想法不是实事求是的。根据我们的了解，在系科志愿的选择上，今年将以报考工科者为最多。青年同学们为祖国工业化的远大理想所鼓舞，急迫地想成为这一方面的专才，以便更好地为祖国贡献自己的力量，这种愿望和心情是完全可以理解的，同时也是值得鼓励的；但是，不可讳言的，部分同学对于国家经济建设的复杂性和艰巨性还缺乏全面的正确的认识。我们知道：工业建设是不能也不可能和其他建设对立起来的，它需要各方面有机的配合。例如：为了适应高等学校发展的需要，就要重视培养中学师资；为了增进劳动人民的健康，以便更好地为祖国建设服务，就需要培养医药卫生干部；为了培养高等学校的师资和科学研究机关的研究人员，就需要同学去学理科；为了保证工业原料和商品粮食的充分供应，就需要同学去学农林科；同时，我们国家的经济建设是多方面的，需要的人才也是多方面的，因此也必须有一定数目的同学去学习语文、财经、政法、体育、艺术等科。总之，凡是招生计划中所规定的，都是国家建设计划中所迫切需要培养的人才。各系科本身是没有重要或不重要之分，只是它们在国家经济建设计划中所占的比重各不相同而已。有的同学认为只有学工科才能实现自己的抱负，学习其他各科便是“浪费青春”，这种想法显然是不正确的而且是有害的。又有的同学想学医是为了“当大夫，穿白衣服神气，名气好，薪水拿得多，别人有病来找我，我不找别人”。这种以个人的名誉、待遇、地位为出发点的升学思想，乃是资本主义“名利观点”的遗毒，也应该加以批判。如果同学们沾染了这种恶劣思想，就谈不上为人民服务的远大的抱负了。
    那么，怎样才算是正确的升学思想呢？
    我认为正确的升学思想应该是首先根据国家的需要，结合个人的兴趣和具体条件，认真地选择系科志愿。例如：有的同学语文基础较好，利于向文科方面发展，就适宜于投考文科；有的同学数理化基础知识较好，利于向理工科方面发展，就适宜投考理工科。凡是不考虑自己的条件（主要是健康条件和文化程度）而为了“赶浪头”去报考一些“热门”系科的，或为了贪图轻快而去报考一些“冷门”系科的，都不是实事求是的态度，将来也很可能不能充分发挥自己的智慧和才能。同时应该说明，因为同学们在系科的选择上不可能百分之百与国家的需要相适应，在录取时少数同学分配到与自己所填志愿不同的系科也是不可避免的。
    在学校志愿的选择上，多数同学只愿意报考少数有名的学校，不大愿意报考一些不大著名的学校。就一般情况来说，若干有名的学校在教学设备上和师资配备上比较其他学校要优越些，但是两者的距离是不会相差悬殊的。事实证明，经过三年来一系列的整顿、恢复和改革工作以后，全国各高等学校的面貌已经焕然一新。过去很多设备简陋和办理不善的学校都有了很大的改进。今后，随着国家建设的飞跃发展和各类建设干部的迫切需要，政府将逐渐充实各高等学校的师资、设备，并加强行政管理。所以同学们可以不必在学校志愿的选择上作过多的考虑。要使自己成为某一门的专才，学习环境（即学校）虽然有一定的影响，但决定个人成败和对祖国贡献大小的关键主要还是要靠自己的努力。同学们！随着国家经济建设的突飞猛进，我们祖国已经为每一个青年开辟了无限光明和广阔的前途，只要自己积极努力，是不愁没有“用武之地”的。
    在地区的选择上，有些同学们也考虑得比较多。大城市好呢，还是小城市好？本区好呢，还是外区好？由于各人的具体情况不同，各人的想法也就不同。我想，假如同学们真正是为了建设伟大的祖国而升学，而不是为了贪图大城市的繁华或物质享受而升学的话，大城市或小城市，本区或外区，应该是没有多大关系的。由于投考学生志愿与国家招生计划不能够完全相符，特别是由于各地高等学校招生任务与各该地区学生来源不平衡，录取时对于学生在地区上的调动是必要的，也是不可避免的。我们在进行这项工作时，将避免不必要的两区对调，尽可能地做到合情合理，以便照顾到学生的生活条件，使学习不受影响。
        三、对同学们的几点希望
    第一、高等学校的招生工作，关系着国家培养各类建设人才计划的实施，是一件非常重大而艰巨的工作。为了做好这件工作，除全国高等学校招生委员会各级组织必须倾其全力做好一切准备工作外，还希望同学们充分发挥爱国主义的精神，主动配合，以保证招生任务的胜利完成。
    第二、为了同学们能顺利地进入高等学校学习，主要当然是依靠平日的努力，但在考试之前有计划地进行温课也是很必要的。最近，听说有的同学为了升学考试而每天“开夜车”，体力不支时就“抹凉油”或“拧大腿”，以致患了神经衰弱、消化不良等病，这种情况是很不好的，应该引起同学们的严重注意。只有合理地安排自己的学习和休息时间，积极地从事文化娱乐体育活动，才能提高学习的效率，才是迎接升学考试的妥善办法。假如因为拚命赶功课而把身体搞垮了，就可能失掉考试的机会或不能担负今后的学习任务。
    同学们！希望你们要牢牢地记住毛主席对你们的关怀：不仅要好好学习，而且要好好锻炼身体。祝你们入学考试成功！
