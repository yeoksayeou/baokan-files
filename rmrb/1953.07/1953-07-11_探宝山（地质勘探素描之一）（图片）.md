    Treasure Mountain (A Sketch of Geological Exploration, Part 1)
    By Qin Zheng and Chen Yin
    The "key to Treasure Mountain" has been found!
    (There is a mining area where an ancient myth circulates, saying that these mountains are full of treasures, but the key to opening the mountain has been lost, so for many generations, no one has been able to enter the mountain to extract treasure.)
