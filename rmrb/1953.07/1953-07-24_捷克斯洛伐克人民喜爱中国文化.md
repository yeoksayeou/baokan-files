    Czechoslovak People Love Chinese Culture
    Czechoslovakia Ya. Dvořák
    Before World War II, very few people in Czechoslovakia could read and translate Chinese literature or scientific and political readings. After World War II, especially after the Chinese people achieved a great revolutionary victory and established ties with the People's Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people's interest in Chinese culture and the study of the Chinese language rapidly expanded. Today, a large group of young men and women students are diligently studying Chinese language and literature around the Oriental Institute and Charles University in Prague. The advanced among them are already translating many Chinese literary works into Czech. Leading their study and research is Comrade Jaroslav Průšek, an academician of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, who is one of the most outstanding scholars of Chinese culture in Europe.
    In order to meet the needs of these scholars, a fairly large Chinese library, the Lu Xun Library, was specially established in Prague. In the library's collection of more than 33,000 volumes, one can find China's most famous ancient and modern literary works, historical documents, book collections, Buddhist scriptures, Chinese translations of foreign works, outstanding contemporary Chinese political works, and many readings to help learn Chinese, such as phonetic symbols, word lists, etc. This Chinese library, the largest in Central Europe, constantly replenishes its collection. At the same time, delegations from the People's Republic of China often donate Chinese books. Therefore, its collection includes various newly published Chinese books and periodicals.
    The Lu Xun Library is located in the Oriental Institute in Prague, the building of which is a magnificent palace. Two scholars who are proficient in Chinese manage the library. They are compiling a catalog of the collection and regularly supply readers with the books they need. These readers are expanding with the increasing number of students who understand Chinese. Now, not only is there a Chinese department in the Oriental Institute in Prague, but also students in various universities outside Prague are learning Chinese. In the first academic year, they learn the simplest courses—phonetics—and then slowly learn to read newspapers and magazines. The Lu Xun Library provides great help to those advanced students who are learning Chinese and those who have graduated from university and are still continuing their research work. For example, a young Sinologist named Dana Stovíčková borrowed a lot of materials from the library to prepare to write a thesis on the development of Chinese poetry from 1911 to 1942. These materials include Chinese poetry, literary criticism, and literary history works during this period. Another young Sinologist, Bolek Tkałc, studied the script "Li Chuang Wang" compiled by the writer A Ying and translated the script into Czech.
    Ordinary Czechoslovak people who are interested in Chinese literature also often use this library. Workers' clubs in various factories and enterprises often organize workers to visit the Lu Xun Library. Here, they listen to reports on Chinese culture and Chinese literature. The staff of the Lu Xun Library and the Oriental Institute also often go to various factories outside Prague to give lectures to meet the requirements of people in other places.
    The Czechoslovak people love Chinese literary works very much. Translations of Chinese literary works can be found in every bookstore. Their circulation is in the tens of thousands of copies or more, and they are quickly sold out and have to be reprinted.
    The collection of Chinese poetry "Songs of Ancient China" and "Songs of New China," translated by the late Professor Max Hus with the help of Academician Průšek, are the most familiar to Czechoslovak readers. Professor Max Hus's beautiful translations have made Czechoslovak readers love Chinese poetry and have had a considerable influence on some Czech poets. These translations have been reprinted several times.
    Many Chinese literary works have been translated into Czech, the most important of which is the publication of selected works by Lu Xun. The first volume that has been published includes Lu Xun's "Call to Arms" and "Wild Grass." The next few volumes will include his other important works, his short essays, essays, and selections of letters. Translations of Guo Moruo's historical works are currently being printed. Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River" and Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane" have a wide influence among readers. Another novel about Chinese rural life, Zhao Shuli's "The Rhymes of Li Youcai," has also been published. Yuan Jing and Kong Jue's "New Heroes and Heroines" is being prepared for publication. The publication of "Heroes of Lüliang" and "Wildfire on the Plain" is being prepared. Wang Xijian's "Upside Down Record" and the Chinese legendary novel "Water Margin" have been translated. The translator of "Water Margin" is Dr. Palat, who is also preparing to write an introduction to the novel. Academician Průšek has translated Mao Dun's outstanding novel "Midnight" and has published it. Mr. and Mrs. Hedlička have translated Cao Ming's novel "Motive Force," and now this novel is in the hands of Czechoslovak readers.
    In terms of poetry, Tian Jian's "The Ballad of the Cart Driver," which was recently published, has been widely praised by readers. The most famous play is of course "The White-Haired Girl," which has been staged in Czechoslovakia. Lao She's play "Dragon Beard Ditch" and some other famous Chinese plays will also be translated and published soon.
    The translation of Xiao San's "The Teenage Years of Comrade Mao Zedong" is the most warmly welcomed by Czechoslovak readers. Mao Zedong's philosophical works and political essays have also been published.
    Czechoslovak Sinologists are also introducing Chinese literary works to domestic readers with their own works. Academician Průšek is preparing to conduct extensive research and introduction to modern Chinese literature. Dr. Berta Krebsová is completing a thesis on the life and works of Lu Xun. A young scholar, Dana Kalvodová, is writing a thesis introducing Ding Ling. A Chinese department student, Zbořilek, has written a work on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution. The Hedlička's research on Chinese woodcuts and the publication of two volumes of Chinese woodcut collections have aroused great interest among Czechoslovak readers.
    Now, the number of people in Czechoslovakia who are proficient in Chinese and introduce Chinese culture has increased considerably compared to the past. More and more Czechoslovak people have become interested in Chinese literature and art, because they vividly reflect the heroic struggle and life of the Chinese people. Due to the increase in the number of people learning Chinese and the promotion of translations of Chinese literary works, the working people of Czechoslovakia will further understand the Chinese people, and the cultural exchange and friendly cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia will also be further developed.

    捷克斯洛伐克人民喜爱中国文化
    捷克斯洛伐克  雅·德伏夏克
    在第二次世界大战以前，捷克斯洛伐克国内很少有人能够阅读和翻译中国的文学作品或科学与政治的读物。第二次世界大战以后，特别是中国人民取得了伟大的革命胜利、并与人民的捷克斯洛伐克建立了联系以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民对于中国文化的兴趣和对于中国语文的学习，就迅速地扩大了。今天，围绕着布拉格的东方学院和查尔士大学，有一大群年轻的男女学生在努力地学习中国的语文和文学，他们中间的先进者已在把中国的许多文学作品译成捷克文。领导他们学习和研究的是捷克斯洛伐克科学院的院士雅罗斯拉夫·普实克同志，他是欧洲研究中国文化的最优秀的学者之一。
    为了适应这些学者们的需要，特地在布拉格成立了一个相当大的中文图书馆——鲁迅图书馆。在这个图书馆的三万三千多卷藏书中，可以找到中国最著名的古代与现代的文学作品、历史文献、图书集成、佛经、外国著作的中文译本、当代中国杰出的政治著作和许多帮助学习中文的读物，如注音符号、单字表等等。这个在中欧最大的中文图书馆，经常补充自己的藏书，同时，从中华人民共和国来的代表团也常常馈赠一些中文书籍。因此，在它的藏书中，有中国最新出版的各种书刊。
    鲁迅图书馆设在布拉格的东方学院内，这个学院的建筑是一座很壮观的宫殿。管理这个图书馆的有两个熟谙中文的学者。他们正在编制藏书的目录，并经常供应读者所需要的书籍。这些读者，随着懂得中文的学生人数的不断增加而扩大起来。现在不仅布拉格的东方学院里设有中文系，而且布拉格以外的各个大学中也有学生在学习中文。他们在第一学年学习最简单的课程——拼音，然后慢慢地学习阅读报纸和杂志。鲁迅图书馆给那些学习中文的先进学生和那些已从大学毕业而仍继续着研究工作的人们以大的帮助。例如，有一个名叫达娜·斯托维茨科娃的年轻的汉学家，向图书馆借到了许多材料，准备写一篇关于中国诗歌在一九一一年至一九四二年这一期间的发展情形的论文。这些材料中包括在此期间的中国诗歌、文学评论和文学史的著作等。另一个年轻的汉学家波列克·特卡尔古，研读了作家阿英所编的剧本“李闯王”，并把这个剧本译成了捷克文。
    对中国文学有兴趣的普通的捷克斯洛伐克人，也常常利用这个图书馆。各个工厂企业的工人俱乐部常常组织工人们来访问鲁迅图书馆。他们在这里听一些关于中国文化与中国文学的报告。鲁迅图书馆和东方学院的工作人员们也常常到布拉格以外的各个工厂去讲演，以满足外地人们的要求。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民十分喜爱中国的文学作品。在每一家书店里，都可以找到中国文学作品的译本。它们的发行数都在几万册以上，并且很快地就因销售一空而要再版。
    由已故的马息休斯教授在普实克院士帮助之下翻译的中国诗歌集“古代中国之歌”与“新中国之歌”，是捷克斯洛伐克读者最熟悉的。马息休斯教授的美丽的译文，使得捷克斯洛伐克的读者对中国诗歌发生了热爱，并对一些捷克诗人起了相当的影响。这些译本都再版了几次。
    许多中国文学著作，已译成了捷克文，其中最重要的是鲁迅选集的出版。在已出版的第一卷中，包括鲁迅的“呐喊”与“野草”。下几卷中将包括他的其他重要作品，他的短论、杂文与书信的选辑。郭沫若的历史著作的译本现正在印刷中。丁玲的“太阳照在桑干河上”，周立波的“暴风骤雨”在读者中有着广泛的影响。另一本关于中国农村生活的小说，赵树理的“李有才板话”也已出版。袁静、孔厥合著的“新儿女英雄传”正在准备出版。“吕梁英雄传”、“平原烈火”的出版工作正在准备中。王希坚的“地覆天翻记”与中国的传奇小说“水浒传”已经译好了。“水浒传”的译者是派拉特博士，他还准备为这部小说写一篇介绍。普实克院士已译完了茅盾的杰出小说“子夜”，并已出版。赫德利奇卡夫妇译出了草明的小说“原动力”，现在这部小说已在捷克斯洛伐克读者的手里了。
    在诗歌方面，最近出版的田间的“赶车传”，在读者中获得了广泛的好评。最著名的剧本当然要推已在捷克斯洛伐克上演过的“白毛女”。老舍的剧本“龙须沟”和另外一些著名的中国剧本，也即将翻译出版。
    萧三的“毛泽东同志的青少年时代”的译本，是最受捷克斯洛伐克读者的热烈欢迎的。毛泽东的哲学著作和政治论文也已出版了。
    捷克斯洛伐克的汉学家们，也以自己的著作来向本国读者介绍中国的文学作品。普实克院士正在准备对现代中国文学进行广泛的研究和介绍。贝尔达·克列勃索娃博士正在完成关于鲁迅的生平与著作的论文。年轻的学者达娜·卡伏多娃正在写一篇介绍丁玲的论文。中文系学生兹波列克已写成了关于太平天国革命的作品。赫德利奇卡夫妇对于中国木刻的研究，和两卷中国木刻集的出版，在捷克斯洛伐克读者中间引起了很大的兴趣。
    现在捷克斯洛伐克国内精通中文和介绍中国文化的人，是比从前相当地增加了。愈来愈多的捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国的文学艺术发生了兴趣。因为它们生动地反映了中国人民的英勇斗争和生活。由于学习中文的人的增多与中国文学著作译本的推广，捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民将进一步了解中国人民，中捷两国的文化交流和友好合作也将更加发展起来。（附图片）
