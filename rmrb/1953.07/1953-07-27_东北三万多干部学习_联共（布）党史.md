About 32,000 cadres in Northeast China, participating in the study of socialist economic construction theory in advanced and intermediate groups, have successively begun studying Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."

Liaodong and Dalian and other provinces and cities held grand opening ceremonies at the start of the semester. Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Lie, Secretary-General of the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other responsible comrades of the provincial and municipal party committees, made mobilization reports on strengthening cadres' theoretical study before the start of the semester, which was of great significance in promoting this study.

Instructors from the Northeast first-level organs and various provinces and cities who are responsible for teaching Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" are actively preparing courses, and some have already begun lecturing. On July 8, the Northeast Bureau's directly affiliated organs' spare-time political school invited Liu Zizai, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, to give a preliminary report on studying Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" to the students of the intermediate group (Class A). On July 15, the intermediate groups of the Northeast Bureau's directly affiliated organs, the Public Security Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and various units under Shenyang Municipality had their first lessons. In order to improve the quality of teachers' lectures, the Propaganda Department and Study Office of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee have convened the first teaching research conference for teachers teaching Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Changchun City is also actively preparing to convene a teaching research conference. In order to strengthen the study guidance for the intermediate group, the core groups of the advanced groups in Jilin, Rehe and other provinces began to study Chapter Nine in June. Students in the advanced group in Dalian are prepared to first participate in the discussions of the intermediate groups in various units to gain an in-depth understanding of the learning situation and familiarize themselves with the teaching requirements of the intermediate group.

At present, the study of Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in advanced and intermediate groups in various regions is undergoing preview and reading. In the past, some cadres in some units were not accustomed to self-study and could not study diligently, but in this study, they all paid attention to carefully reading the documents. The intermediate group students of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League used two or three mornings a week for mutual assistance learning.

The current problems are: the departments leading the study at the top have plans, but many units at the bottom do not have specific study plans, and cadres lack necessary guidance in reading. Therefore, in the preview, many cadres have read the text two or three times, but feel that they cannot delve into it and cannot raise questions. To this end, the Northeast Daily pointed out: all regions must strengthen learning guidance, help and enlighten students to study the courses in depth, and at the same time pay attention to cultivating the habit of hard self-study, and appropriately criticize certain ideas that only want to listen to lectures but are unwilling to study on their own. In addition, all regions must also pay attention to strengthening teaching work, urging teachers to prepare lessons well, give good lectures, and improve the quality of teaching.

### 东北三万多干部学习“联共（布）党史”

    东北三万多干部学习“联共（布）党史”
    东北全区参加社会主义经济建设理论学习的高级组和中级组干部大约三万二千余人，已陆续开始学习“联共（布）党史”第九章。
    辽东及旅大等省市在开学时举行了隆重的开学典礼。中共旅大市委书记欧阳钦、中共辽东省委秘书长张烈等省市党委负责同志，都在开学前做了有关加强干部理论学习的动员报告，对于推动这次学习有很大的意义。
    东北一级机关及各省市担任讲授“联共（布）党史”第九章的教员，都在积极准备课程，有的并已开始讲课。七月八日，东北局直属机关业余政治学校请东北局宣传部刘子载副部长给中级组（甲班）学员作了学习“联共（布）党史”第九章的启发报告。七月十五日，东北局直属机关、东北行政委员会公安局各单位及沈阳市属各单位中级组都已上了第一次课。为了提高教员讲课的质量，黑龙江省委宣传部和学习室已召集讲授“联共（布）党史”第九章的教员举行了第一次教学研究会。长春市也正在积极准备召开教学研究会。为了加强对中级组的学习辅导，吉林、热河等省高级组核心组在六月份即开始了第九章的学习。旅大市高级组的学员准备先参加各单位的中级组的讨论，深入了解学习情况，熟悉中级组的教学要求。
    目前，各地高级组和中级组的“联共（布）党史”第九章的学习，正进行预习和阅读。有些单位过去有些干部不习惯于自学，不能刻苦钻研，但在这次学习中都注意了精读文件。青年团吉林省委会的中级组学员，每周利用两三个早晨进行了互助学习。
    现在存在的问题是：上面领导学习的部门有计划，下面不少单位都没有具体的学习计划，干部在阅读当中缺乏必要的指导。因此，在预习当中有不少干部虽然将课文看了两三遍，但感到钻不下去，提不出问题来。为此，东北日报指出：各地必须加强学习辅导工作，帮助和启发学员深入钻研课程，同时注意培养刻苦自修的习惯，对某些只愿听讲不肯自修的思想应适当加以批评。另外，各地还必须注意加强教学工作，督促教员备好课，讲好课，提高讲授质量。
