    People in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Jiangxi Province Enthusiastically Participate in the Universal Suffrage Movement

    Since the trial implementation of universal suffrage began in early June, the people in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province, who had undergone long-term revolutionary struggles, have enthusiastically participated in the universal suffrage movement. In the 221 pilot townships and towns in 24 counties such as Ruijin and Xingguo, the masses voluntarily participated in various small-scale report meetings and symposiums, and engaged in heated discussions on the great significance of universal suffrage. In the twelve pilot townships of Ruijin County, more than 30 advanced farmers and rural intellectuals also assisted the universal suffrage work teams in carrying out universal suffrage work in their spare time. Hundreds of propagandists and newspaper reading groups in various places also actively participated in universal suffrage propaganda work.

    In the pilot work of universal suffrage, the people in the old base areas cherished their democratic rights very much. People realized that elections must be prudent, and no bad elements should be allowed to infiltrate the people's regime. Many mothers of revolutionary martyrs deeply felt that today's democratic rights were bought with the blood of their children. They repeatedly stated that they must nominate candidates who truly represent their opinions and correctly implement the various policies of the People's Government. At present, some of the pilot universal suffrage work in the old base areas has completed population surveys and voter registration. People were very excited after receiving their voter registration cards. They said: This is the result of decades of bloody sacrifice and struggle. With a voter registration card, we have the right to be masters of our own affairs, and we must hold this right firmly in our own hands.

    The Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province

    Piloting Basic-Level Universal Suffrage Work

    The pilot basic-level universal suffrage work in Yupu and Jinlan Townships of the Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province is progressing smoothly.

    The pilot work of basic-level universal suffrage in Yupu and Jinlan Townships began on June 19. Prior to this, 91 cadres from various ethnic groups such as Miao, Yao, Zhuang, Han, Yi, and Dong had been trained in a centralized manner. At the beginning of the work, it was the busy farming season. The working cadres emphasized the close integration of universal suffrage work with production, helping farmers of all ethnic groups in the two townships carry out production and helping them overcome difficulties in production. In the propaganda work of universal suffrage, the working cadres tried their best to adopt propaganda forms that the minority people loved, such as compiling the contents of the universal suffrage documents into Miao folk songs, which were sung at any time, and were very popular among the masses.

    In the past, many people of all ethnic groups in Yupu and Jinlan Townships falsely reported their ages in order to avoid being conscripted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Through the propaganda and education of universal suffrage, they realized the true meaning of universal suffrage, and people of all ethnic groups took out their collected "genealogical records" to correct their ages. When the voter registration ended, people of all ethnic groups received their voter registration cards and treasured them. People of all ethnic groups also happily viewed the voter lists written on large red paper.

    Fushun Open-Pit Mine Establishes Universal Suffrage Work Group

    To Assist the District Election Committee's Work

    The Fushun Open-Pit Mine established a universal suffrage work group to assist the district election committee in carrying out its work, enabling the population survey and voter registration work of the entire mine to proceed smoothly.

    Most of the employees of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine live in the Lutian District of Fushun City. When the registration station of the Lutian District Election Committee began conducting population surveys and voter registration in the mine's employee residential area, it encountered many difficulties: for example, the registration station personnel were not familiar with the situation, making it difficult to accurately verify the employees' voter qualifications; workers rested in three shifts every day, and some workers could not return to their dormitories at a certain time after work, making it difficult to register them; some employees had not yet registered their households, and they were scattered throughout the mine, making it easy to overlook them. These situations were also common in other mines and factories.

    The Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China studied these situations and decided to establish universal suffrage work organizations in mines and factories to assist the district election committees in carrying out various basic-level election work in their units. The Lutian Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China in Fushun City, together with the trade union and personnel departments of the administrative side, selected eight people to form a universal suffrage work group. According to the plan of the district election committee, it formulated a universal suffrage work plan for the entire mine and started work. In this way, the verification of voter qualifications and population survey and registration work were accurate, and the registration work and the time of the employees were saved.

    At present, the population survey and voter registration work in the collective dormitory of the entire open-pit mine has been mostly completed. The universal suffrage work group is now urging relevant units to investigate and register employees without household registration. After the population survey and voter registration work is completed in the entire mine, the universal suffrage work group will begin to divide electoral districts, register voters, and other work. In late July, the entire mine can conduct elections.

    Northeast Administrative Committee

    Deploys Universal Suffrage Work in Government Organizations

    On June 24, the Northeast Administrative Committee convened a meeting of persons in charge from 56 units under its jurisdiction and various people's organizations to discuss and deploy universal suffrage work in government organizations and to transfer cadres to participate in basic-level elections.

    Wang Jinxiang, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, delivered a report at the meeting. After explaining in detail the great significance of universal suffrage, he pointed out that in order to do a good job in the universal suffrage work in government organizations, each unit should immediately organize all staff members to study the universal suffrage documents. Through this study, cadres in government organizations will generally receive a profound education in order to better improve their work and actively participate in the universal suffrage movement.

    In order to enable all government organizations to actively cooperate with the basic-level election work in their respective areas, Wang Jinxiang proposed that each government organization should form an election work group of three to five people, led by the personnel or secretarial department, to carry out work under the unified leadership of the local election committee. Throughout the entire election process, the employees of the Northeast first-level government organizations must respect the unified leadership of the local election committees. At the same time, all government organizations must adopt a cautious and serious attitude to examine the voter qualifications of the government organization's employees in accordance with the election law issued by the central government and relevant documents on voter qualification review, and ensure that the highest proportion of voters participate in the election. At the meeting, the persons in charge of each unit expressed their willingness to actively prepare and participate in the universal suffrage movement.

    The meeting finally discussed the issue of transferring cadres from the Northeast first-level government organizations to various provinces and cities to help with basic-level election work. According to the current manpower and business situation of each unit, it was decided to transfer about 400 cadres from 17 units such as the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Cultural and Educational Affairs Committee, and various people's organizations, as well as political and legal cadre schools. After a week of training, this group of cadres will be dispatched to various provinces and cities according to the universal suffrage time in various places to help carry out basic-level election work.

    Shanghai Zhicheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory

    Production Improved During the Universal Suffrage

    Shanghai Zhicheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory is a private factory with more than 400 workers, most of whom are female workers. When the pilot work of universal suffrage began, the factory leaders clearly realized that the factory's election work must be combined with production. Therefore, they properly arranged every step of the universal suffrage activities so that it would not affect production and workers' rest time. For example, the universal suffrage propaganda and population survey work were all carried out in spare time. The method of population survey was also very simple. First, the people of the universal suffrage work team explained the specific methods to the grassroots cadres in the factory, and then the registration was carried out in the form of convening production mutual aid group meetings. The entire factory completed the registration in half an hour. Finally, the technical cadres of the universal suffrage work team checked and copied the initial draft based on the registration and labor insurance cards. Voter registration was also carried out by mobile registration stations going to the workshops. The workers took turns registering in the way of mutual aid in production, and each person completed it in only half a minute. In order not to take up too much of the workers' rest time, attention was paid to holding as few meetings as possible. The meetings that had to be held were prepared in advance, and the general meetings were all around one hour.

    The workers were in high spirits during the universal suffrage. Under the slogan of "Do a good job in production and welcome universal suffrage," they further developed their enthusiasm for production. Many workers voluntarily proposed to consciously abide by labor discipline and do a good job in production to welcome universal suffrage. Since the universal suffrage work began in June, the absenteeism rate of the factory's workers has decreased from 13.5% in May to 9.34%; both the output and quality have improved in June. The defective cloth rate has decreased from 2.94% in May to 2.25%. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江西省革命老根据地人民热烈参加普选运动
    今年六月初，普选试办工作在各地开始以后，经过长期革命斗争的江西省革命老根据地的人民都热烈地参加了普选运动。瑞金、兴国等二十四个县的二百二十一个典型试办乡、镇中，群众都自动参加了各种小型报告会、座谈会，对普选的重大意义展开了热烈的讨论。瑞金县十二个试办乡中并有三十多个先进农民和农村知识分子在业余时间内协助普选工作组开展普选工作。各地数以百计的宣传员、读报组也都积极参加了普选宣传工作。
    在普选试办工作中，老根据地人民对自己的民主权利非常珍重。人们都认识到选举要慎重，不能让一个坏分子钻进人民的政权。很多革命先烈的母亲，都深切地感到今天的民主权利是自己的儿女们用鲜血换来的，她们一再表示一定要提出真正能代表他们的意见，正确执行人民政府各项政策的人当候选人。现在，老根据地的普选试办工作有的已完成人口调查和选民登记工作。人们在领到选民证后，都非常兴奋。他们说：这是几十年流血牺牲斗争的结果，有了选民证就有了当家权，一定要好好地把这个权利掌握在自己手里。
    广西省大苗山苗族自治区
    试办基层普选工作
    广西省大苗山苗族自治区的雨蒲、金蓝两乡，试办基层普选工作，进展顺利。
    雨蒲、金蓝两乡的基层普选试办工作，自六月十九日开始。在这以前，曾集中训练了苗、瑶、僮、汉、彝、侗等各民族的干部九十一人。在工作开始时，正值农忙季节，工作干部强调普选工作与生产紧密结合，在两乡帮助各族农民进行生产，并帮助他们克服生产中的困难。在进行普选的宣传工作中，工作干部尽量采用少数民族人民爱好的宣传形式，如把普选文件内容编成苗族山歌，随时歌唱，很受群众欢迎。
    雨蒲、金蓝两乡各族人民，过去为逃避国民党反动派的强迫征兵拉伕，虚报年龄的人很多，通过普选的宣传教育，认清了普选的真实意义，各族人民都把收藏着的“庚谱”拿出来，校正了年龄。当选民登记结束，各族人民领到选民证后，都把它当做珍贵的东西保存起来。各族人民还以极欢欣的心情去看用大红纸写成的选民榜。
    抚顺露天矿成立普选工作小组
    协助区选举委员会工作
    抚顺露天矿成立普选工作小组，协助区选举委员会进行工作，使全矿的人口调查和选民登记工作得以顺利进行。
    抚顺露天矿的大部分职工住在抚顺市露天区。露天区选举委员会的登记站，在该矿职工住宅区开始进行人口调查和选民登记时，曾碰到许多困难：如登记站人员不熟悉情况，难以确切地审查职工的选民资格；工人每天分三班轮番休息，有些工人下班后又不能在一定时间回到宿舍，很难进行登记；有些职工尚未登记户口，他们散居在矿内各处，很容易被遗漏。这些情况在其他矿、厂也普遍存在。
    中共抚顺市委员会研究了这些情况，确定在矿山、工厂内分别成立普选工作组织，协助区选举委员会进行本单位的各项基层选举工作。中共抚顺市露天煤矿委员会与工会和行政方面的人事科等单位抽调八个人，组成了普选工作小组，根据区选举委员会的计划，制订了全矿普选工作计划，开始工作。这样，即使选民资格的审查和人口调查登记工作做得确切，又节省了登记工作和职工的时间。
    现在，露天矿全矿集体宿舍的人口调查与选民登记工作已大部分结束。普选工作小组现正督促各有关单位调查登记无户口的职工。人口调查和选民登记工作在全矿结束以后，普选工作小组即将着手划分选区，登记选民等工作，七月下旬，全矿就可进行选举。
    东北行政委员会
    布置机关普选工作
    东北行政委员会在六月二十四日召集所属各部门及各人民团体共五十六个单位的负责人开会，讨论与布置机关普选工作及抽调干部参加基层选举等问题。
    东北行政委员会副主席汪金祥在会上作了报告。他在对普选的重大意义作了详细的说明后指出：为了做好机关普选工作，各单位应立即组织全体工作人员学习普选文件。通过这一学习，使机关干部普遍受到一次深刻的教育，以求更好地提高和改进工作，积极参加普选运动。
    为了使各机关都能主动地配合所在地区的基层选举工作，汪金祥提出：各机关应以人事或秘书部门为主，组织三人到五人的选举工作小组，在所在地选举委员会统一领导下进行工作。在整个选举过程中，东北一级机关的职工必须尊重地方选举委员会的统一领导。同时，各机关必须按照中央发布的选举法及有关选民资格审查等文件，采取慎重严肃的态度，审查机关职工的选民资格，并保证最高比例的选民参加选举。会上，各单位负责人都表示要积极进行准备，参加普选运动。
    会议最后研究了抽调东北一级机关干部赴各省市帮助基层选举工作问题。根据各单位现有人力及业务情况，决定从政法委员会、文教委员会以及各人民团体等十七个单位和政法干部学校抽调干部四百名左右。这批干部经过一周的训练，即按各地普选时间分赴各省市帮助进行基层选举工作。
    上海市志成染织厂
    在普选中生产情况有了改进
    上海市志成染织厂是一家有四百多工人的私营工厂，绝大部分是女工。当普选试办工作开始时，工厂领导上就比较明确地认识到工厂的选举工作必须与生产结合进行。因此，他们妥善地安排了普选活动的每一个步骤，使其不影响生产和工人的休息时间。如普选宣传和人口调查工作，全部是利用业余时间进行。人口调查的办法也非常简便，先由普选工作队的人向厂里的基层干部交代具体做法，然后以召开生产互助组会议的方式进行登记，全厂共化半小时就登记完了。最后由普选工作队的技术干部根据登记的初稿和劳动保险卡片加以核对謄清。选民登记也是由流动登记站下车间去进行的。工人们用生产互助的办法，依次轮流登记，每人只化半分钟就成了。为了不过多地占用工人休息时间，尽量注意少开会议，必须召开的会议，事先都经过准备，一般会议都在一小时左右。
    在进行普选中，工人们的情绪很高。他们在“搞好生产，迎接普选”的口号下，进一步发挥了生产的热情。许多工人自动提出要自觉地遵守劳动纪律，搞好生产，来迎接普选。从六月份普选工作开始以来，全厂工人的缺勤率已由五月份的百分之十三点五，减到百分之九点三四；六月份的产量、质量都有了提高。次布率已由五月份的百分之二点九四降低到百分之二点二五。    （新华社）
