Letters from readers Gao Budou, Da Yong, and Zhang Biao: The Linfen Central Branch of the People's Bank of China in Shanxi Province has exposed some past deviations in its work during the recent anti-bureaucracy struggle.

In the work of issuing loans, the deviations that occurred in the past at the bank and its subordinate branches were: First, rigidly adhering to the principle of designated use of funds, divorced from reality. The instructions from the superior bank stated that the proportion of capital construction loans, especially water conservancy loans, should be relatively large in agricultural loans; this was suitable for general situations. However, in Quwo County, what the masses actually needed most were loans for fertilizers, livestock, and carts, but the bank still mechanically implemented this regulation. As a result, the loans could not effectively solve the production difficulties of the farmers, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Second, neglecting to support individual farmers. The Yicheng branch allocated all of its more than 17 million yuan in loans to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in March of this year, leaving not a single loan for individual farmers. The Anze branch distributed most of the livestock loans equally to agricultural production cooperatives, and many mutual aid teams and individual farmers in urgent need of loans could not get them, while some agricultural production cooperatives that did not want loans were forced to accept them. Third, incorrectly promoting the method of "signing loan and deposit contracts," that is, farmers who receive loans must deposit money in the bank. Linfen County's Sixth District even stipulated that borrowers' deposits must be at least three times the amount of the loan in order to be eligible for a loan. The Quwo branch lent an agricultural production cooperative 8 million yuan and signed a contract requiring them to deposit 20 million yuan. Fourth, incorrectly emphasizing the policy of loans "combining 40 percent of private capital." In Nandui Village, Yicheng County, a farmer wanted to borrow money to buy a waterwheel and could come up with 300,000 yuan himself. However, the bank cadres calculated that 300,000 yuan was less than 40 percent of the price of the waterwheel, so they did not issue the loan. This practice meant that some farmers who genuinely had difficulties in life and production and needed support could not get loans, while bank loans were all issued to wealthy households who did not need them.

In the work of developing credit cooperatives, the tendency of blindly rushing forward was serious. The central branch made very large plans, and some branches, in order to complete their tasks, used coercive methods such as "night watch" or issuing loans to get the masses to buy shares. Even so, the number of societies established in the entire region in the first quarter of this year was only about one-third of the central branch's plan; and many of these societies that were forcibly established received very little share capital, some not even collecting a single share.

In addition, the phenomenon of violating financial regulations and wasting state funds was still very serious in various banks throughout the region. Individual cadres also engaged in corruption and embezzlement.

According to everyone's analysis, the main reason for the above situation was that the leadership neglected political and ideological work and had a bureaucratic work style. The leading comrades themselves did not study politics, did not study policies, and did not go deep into reality to work hard. The political and professional studies of ordinary cadres were even worse, the political atmosphere in the banks was weak, and the ideological level of the cadres was not high. Therefore, not only was work efficiency very low, but it was also easy to make mistakes in implementing policies.

Now, the leading comrades of the central branch have recognized the seriousness of the past problems and have begun to rectify the work. Recently, in addition to sending several work teams to various county branches to help inspect the work, they have also seriously dealt with some events that seriously violated policies.

### 中国人民银行临汾中心支行  检查工作中违反政策的现象

    中国人民银行临汾中心支行
    检查工作中违反政策的现象
    读者高步斗、大勇、张彪来信：中国人民银行山西省临汾中心支行在最近反官僚主义斗争中揭发出过去工作中的一些偏向。
    在发放贷款工作中，该行及所属各支行过去发生的偏差是：一，脱离实际地讲专款专用。上级行指示：在农业贷款中，基本建设贷款，特别是水利贷款比重应该较大；这是适合一般情况的。但是，在曲沃县群众实际上最需要的是肥料、牲畜、大车贷款，而银行仍机械执行这个规定；结果贷款不能很好解决农民生产困难，引起群众不满。二，忽视扶植个体农民。翼城支行今年三月把一千七百多万元的贷款全部分给农业生产合作社和互助组，个体农民一个也贷不到。安泽支行把绝大部分的牲畜贷款平均分贷给农业生产合作社，许多亟需贷款的互助组和个体农民都借不到款，而有些农业生产合作社虽然不愿贷款却被硬贷给了。三，错误地推行“订立贷存款合同”的办法，即贷款农民必须在银行存款。临汾县六区竟规定：贷款者的存款额不到贷款额的三倍，就不得贷款。曲沃支行贷给一个农业生产合作社八百万元，就订合同让存款二千万元。四，错误地强调贷款“结合私资百分之四十”的方针。翼城县南堆村一个农民要贷款置水车，自己可拿出三十万元；但银行干部一算，三十万元还不到水车价款的百分之四十，就不发贷款。这种做法，使一些生活、生产确实有困难而需要扶植的农民得不到贷款，而银行贷款却都发给不需要贷款的富裕户。
    在发展信用合作社的工作中，盲目冒进的偏向是严重的。中心支行计划做得很大，有些支行为了追求完成任务，就用“熬鹰”等强迫命令办法或者发贷款的办法让群众入股。即使这样，全区今年第一季度建社数也只有中心支行计划的三分之一左右；而硬搞起来的这些社，有不少股金收得很少，甚至有些连一股股金都未收起。
    此外，全区各行违反财政制度、浪费国家资金的现象还很严重。个别干部还有贪污、腐化的行为。
    发生以上情况的主要原因，根据大家的分析，是领导方面忽视政治思想工作和有官僚主义作风。领导同志自己不学习政治，不研究政策，又不深入实际艰苦工作。一般干部政治学习、业务学习更差，行中政治空气稀薄，干部思想水平不高。因此不但工作效率很低，而且在执行政策时很容易出漏子。
    现在，中心支行领导方面已经认识了过去问题的严重性，开始着手整顿工作。最近除先后派出几个工作组深入各县支行帮助检查工作外，并严肃处理了一些严重违反政策的事件。
