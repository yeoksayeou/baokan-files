Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 12th. Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: As expected, the "vague" Robertson-Rhee joint statement was released today. Syngman Rhee still hasn't provided any definite guarantees that his government and army will abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement, which is awaiting signature. Now, we'll have to see what effective measures the U.S. will propose to ensure the early realization of the Korean armistice.

Today's Robertson-Rhee joint statement demonstrates that Robertson, as Eisenhower's special envoy, did not manage to get Syngman Rhee to strictly abide by the armistice agreement during his half-month of activities in Seoul. On the contrary, Syngman Rhee received encouragement from Robertson to disrupt the armistice.

The Robertson-Rhee joint statement said that in the past two weeks, "We have made considerable progress in achieving mutual understanding on the difficult issues arising from the arrangements for the armistice, the exchange of prisoners of war, and the future holding of a political conference." Now, let's see what kind of "progress" has actually been made.

This joint statement makes absolutely no mention of whether Syngman Rhee will abide by the armistice agreement and related agreements. This is tantamount to announcing to the world that Syngman Rhee may not abide by the armistice agreement. To conceal this, Robertson, after reading the statement to American reporters last night, specifically added, "We could not have made this statement if we had not received Syngman Rhee's assurance of cooperation with the armistice." However, shortly after this, before the joint statement was officially released, Syngman Rhee told reporters from the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain that he "does not accept the armistice" and only agreed not to obstruct it for ninety days. He said he did not believe in the possibility of peacefully unifying Korea. Syngman Rhee gave Robertson a hard slap in the face. When American reporters questioned Robertson about Syngman Rhee's words, Robertson could not produce Syngman Rhee's "guarantee," except to say "simply intolerable," "regrettable," and "shocking." This shows that the "understanding" reached between Robertson and Syngman Rhee on the armistice arrangements is that the United States allows Syngman Rhee to freely disrupt the armistice after ninety days.

Syngman Rhee also made it clear: "If the political conference held after the armistice fails to resolve the issue of Korean unification after three months," he "will reconsider the situation." This is just a different way of saying what Syngman Rhee has repeatedly clamored in the past, which is to relaunch the war. In reality, Syngman Rhee has not abandoned his ambition to unify Korea by force in the slightest. Moreover, Robertson also told American reporters, "Our purpose in negotiating the armistice – the ceasefire – is only to hold a (political) conference to study the differences between our opinions and those of the Communists. If we cannot resolve our differences at the conference table, we will take whatever action the situation requires." Comparing Robertson's words with Syngman Rhee's statement that he will only not obstruct the armistice for ninety days, it immediately becomes clear that Robertson's words actually mean that if the political conference cannot achieve Syngman Rhee's goal of "unifying" Korea within ninety days, Syngman Rhee can resume the war.

The Robertson-Rhee joint statement makes absolutely no mention of Syngman Rhee handing over the 27,000 prisoners of war he forcibly detained, only vaguely saying that "no prisoner should be coerced." This can only further confirm the accusations from the Korean and Chinese side, that the United States is conniving with Syngman Rhee in "releasing" prisoners of war and has not taken any measures to recover these prisoners of war.

In addition, this joint statement also says that all Korean People's Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated will be released in South Korea within a certain period. This is obviously to further undermine the provisions of Article 11 of the Prisoner of War Agreement in order to continue to forcibly detain our prisoners of war.

People can now see more clearly that the result of the Robertson-Rhee talks is not only not beneficial to the early realization of a Korean armistice, but also further encourages Syngman Rhee's future plans to disrupt the armistice. The joint statement said that the United States and Syngman Rhee have reached an agreement on the issue of signing a "mutual defense treaty," and negotiations on the conclusion of this treaty are underway. According to a report by International News Service today, South Korean officials clearly stated that this treaty would "sufficiently guarantee that the United States would commit its armed forces to the war" when Syngman Rhee relaunches the war under the pretext of "foreign aggression." The joint statement also said that the United States and Syngman Rhee have reached a "broad agreement" on "issues of political, economic, and defense cooperation." Therefore, if there is any "agreement" or any "progress" in the Robertson-Rhee talks, it is that Syngman Rhee has received military, political, and economic support from the United States so that he can relaunch a war of aggression.

The nature of the agreement reached between Robertson and Syngman Rhee is so ugly that they dare not announce all the contents of their agreement and drafted their joint statement as "vaguely as possible." But this is completely in vain. Anyone can see from this joint statement that the United States is adopting an attitude of blatant connivance towards Syngman Rhee. Even the reporter from the International News Service said that Syngman Rhee, this "old cunning gambler," "won money on a hand he should have lost." The International News Service reporter also said that the guarantees made by the United States to Syngman Rhee made South Korea "more closely aligned with the United States than any other country in the world." Robertson's and Syngman Rhee's talks have tied the American people to Syngman Rhee's broken chariot in a different way.

With such a joint statement, the American propaganda machine is now ordered to desperately release an optimistic atmosphere that the Korean armistice will be realized soon. They insist that the United States has obtained an armistice guarantee from Syngman Rhee, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying the armistice to the Korean and Chinese side. But where is Syngman Rhee's guarantee to abide by the armistice agreement? It cannot be found in the Robertson-Rhee joint statement. Syngman Rhee himself said that he did not provide a guarantee, and when American reporters asked Robertson what guarantee he had obtained from Syngman Rhee when he flew from Korea to Tokyo today, Robertson's answer was: "I am not aware of this issue." It can be seen that the so-called guarantee of Syngman Rhee's compliance with the armistice agreement is unbelievable.

### 罗伯逊与李承晚的联合声明证明  美国仍在纵容李承晚破坏停战

    罗伯逊与李承晚的联合声明证明
    美国仍在纵容李承晚破坏停战
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：果然不出所料，“含糊其词的”罗伯逊和李承晚联合声明今天发表了，李承晚依然没有确切保证他的政府和军队遵守只待签字的朝鲜停战协定，现在要看美方提出什么有效措施来使朝鲜停战得以早日实现了。
    今天罗伯逊和李承晚联合声明表明：作为艾森豪威尔特使的罗伯逊在汉城活动了半个月，并没有使李承晚严格遵守停战协定，相反地，李承晚却从罗伯逊那里得到了破坏停战的鼓励。
    罗伯逊和李承晚的联合声明说，在过去两个星期中，“我们在由于安排停战、交换战俘和将来举行政治会议而发生的困难问题上努力获得相互谅解方面，有了相当大的进展”。现在我们且来看看究竟有了些什么样的“进展”。
    在这个联合声明里面，根本没有提到李承晚是否将遵守停战协定以及有关的协议。这就等于向全世界宣布，李承晚可能不遵守停战协定。为了掩饰这一点，罗伯逊在昨天夜里向美国记者宣读了这个声明以后，特地补充说，“如果我们没有得到李承晚对停战合作的保证，我们不可能作出这项声明。”可是，在这之后不久，在联合声明正式发表之前，李承晚却向美国斯克利浦斯—霍华德系报纸记者说，他“不接受停战”，他只不过同意在九十天以内不进行阻挠而已。他说，他不认为能够和平统一朝鲜。李承晚狠狠地打了罗伯逊一记耳光。当美国记者拿李承晚的话质询罗伯逊时，罗伯逊除了说“简直无法忍受”、“遗憾”、“震惊”之外根本拿不出李承晚的“保证”来。由此可见，罗伯逊和李承晚之间在停战安排问题上获得的“谅解”，就是美国容许李承晚在停战以后九十天就可以放手来破坏它。
    李承晚还明白表示：“三个月结束后，如果届时停战后举行的政治会议还不能解决统一朝鲜问题”，他“将对情况重新加以考虑”。这和李承晚过去一再叫嚣将重新发动战争，只是说法不同而已，实际上李承晚并没有丝毫放弃他武力统一朝鲜的野心。而且，罗伯逊也向美国记者们说，“我们谈判停战——停火——的目的只是为了举行一个（政治）会议，以便研究我们与共方的意见分歧。假如我们不能在会议桌上解决我们的分歧，我们将采取局势所需要的一切行动。”把罗伯逊这些话和李承晚所说的他只在九十天之内不阻挠停战的话对照一下，那就立刻可以看出，罗伯逊的话实际上就是说，假如政治会议在九十天之内不能达到李承晚的“统一”朝鲜的目的，李承晚就可以恢复战争。
    罗李联合声明根本没有提到李承晚应交出二万七千名被他强迫扣留的战俘，仅仅含糊其词地说什么“任何俘虏不得受胁迫”。这只能更加证实了朝中方面的指责，即美国纵容李承晚“释放”战俘，并且根本没有采取任何措施追回这些战俘。
    除此之外，这个联合声明还说什么要在一定时期将凡不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员都在南朝鲜释放。这显然是要进一步破坏战俘协议第十一款的规定，来继续强迫扣留我方被俘人员。
    人们现在已可以看得更清楚，罗李会谈的结果，不但对早日实现朝鲜停战没有裨益，而且更加鼓励了李承晚今后破坏停战的打算。联合声明说，美国和李承晚之间在签订“共同防御条约”的问题上获得了协议，关于缔结这个条约的谈判正在进行中。据国际新闻社今天报道，南朝鲜的官员清楚地说明，这个条约在李承晚在“外国侵略”的藉口下重新发动战争时，“足够保证美国会把它的武装力量投入战争。”联合声明还说，美国和李承晚“在政治、经济和防务方面合作的问题”上取得了“广泛的协议”。因此，如果说罗李会谈有什么“协议”、有什么“进展”的话，那就是李承晚从美国那里得到了在军事上、政治上以及经济上的支持，以便他能够重新发动侵略战争。
    罗伯逊与李承晚之间取得的协议的性质是如此丑恶，以致他们不敢宣布他们协议的全部内容，并且把他们的联合声明草拟得“尽可能的含糊其词”。但是这完全是徒劳的。任何人都可以从这个联合声明中看到：美国对李承晚所采取的是公然的纵容态度。甚至国际新闻社的记者也说，李承晚这个“老奸巨猾的赌博者”“在一副本来该输的牌上赢了钱”。国际新闻社的记者还说，美国对李承晚提出的保证使南朝鲜“比世界上任何其他国家都更为紧密地与美国靠在一起”。罗伯逊和李承晚的会谈，已经把美国人民换一个方式缚在李承晚的残破战车上了。
    凭着这么一个联合声明，美国的宣传机器现在奉命拚命放出朝鲜停战不日实现的乐观空气。它们硬说美国已经从李承晚那里得到了停战的保证，企图把拖延停战的责任推在朝中方面了。可是李承晚遵守停战协定的保证在哪里呢？在罗伯逊和李承晚的联合声明中是找不到的。李承晚自己说他没有提出保证，而罗伯逊今天从朝鲜飞抵东京时，美国记者们问他从李承晚那里获得了什么保证，罗伯逊的回答是：“我不了解这个问题。”可见所谓李承晚遵守停战协定的保证是不可置信的。
