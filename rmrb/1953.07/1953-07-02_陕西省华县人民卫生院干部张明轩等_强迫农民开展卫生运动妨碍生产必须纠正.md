    Forcing Farmers to Carry Out Sanitation Campaigns and Impeding Production Must Be Corrected
    [Our Newspaper News] According to the Xi'an Mass Daily News: Zhang Mingxuan and other cadres of the Huaxian People's Health Institute in Shaanxi Province, in leading the spring patriotic health campaign in Beisha Village, Sanxiang, Liuyi District, Huaxian County, have very serious coercive and formalistic work styles, hindering farmers' spring production and infringing on farmers' interests, thus arousing farmers' opposition.
    Beisha Village is a key health village in Huaxian County. In early March of this year, Zhang Mingxuan and Li Xiuxia, cadres of the County Health Institute, went to the village to promote the spring patriotic health campaign. In a month, they led the villagers to remove weeds, clear garbage, and scrape the dust accumulated on the city walls over the years and send it to the fields as fertilizer; the streets were also much cleaner than before.
    However, in order to cultivate Beisha Village into a model health village all at once, Zhang Mingxuan and others ignored that the overriding central task in rural areas is to lead production. They deviated from the reality of the countryside, pursued superficial cleanliness, and used coercive methods to complete tasks.
    After arriving in Beisha Village, Zhang Mingxuan and others did not effectively combine with production to mobilize the masses to carry out patriotic health work. They convened several cadre meetings and mass meetings, mobilizing everyone to "set off a high tide of patriotic health work." They mistakenly proposed the slogan "use hygiene to promote everything," unrealistically demanding that everyone buy a mask and that every family's latrine be built with bricks. They turned a blind eye to the relatively poor harvest and severe spring famine in Beisha Village last year. They ignored the farmers' most urgent need to carry out sideline production to survive the spring famine and carry out spring plowing. Therefore, they did not actively lead the farmers to solve the difficulties in the spring famine and spring plowing, but instead threatened the farmers, saying, "There are many bad people in your village. This health campaign will test you. Whoever is unwilling to do it is a stumbling block and bad element hindering the health campaign." In addition, they deceived the masses, saying, "The Northwest Region has 130 million yuan set aside looking for health models! If you do it, you will be a model health village and you will definitely win a prize."
    The patriotic health campaign in Beisha Village started in this way.
    The entire village of 264 households was divided into 24 health groups. In order to make a breakthrough in health work, Zhang Mingxuan put forward the slogan of "three things without fail": production, hygiene, and implementation of the Marriage Law. He asked farmers to engage in hygiene every morning, production after meals, and Marriage Law propaganda in the evening; he also stipulated that each family must send one person every day to engage in hygiene work. Those who did not come had to ask the health team leader for leave. Those who did not ask for leave would be fined by going to Wulong Mountain, thirty miles away, to carry blue soil. Poor peasant Shi Hengzhong (member of the Youth League branch) was fined 100 kilograms of blue soil because his family had financial difficulties and he went to sell vegetables and did not do hygiene work for two mornings. There were forty or fifty people who were fined like this. In mid-March, it rained for two days, and the weeds in the wheat fields grew very quickly. Those families with less labor force, who were engaged in hygiene, couldn't take care of production, and they were very anxious. As soon as it was light, they secretly ran to the fields to work. Zhang Mingxuan saw that there were fewer people engaged in hygiene and called the health team leader and village chief to scold them, saying, "You have all become masters! You can't even call the masses." Later, because there were too many people who did not come, he had to stop the health campaign for a few days. In this way, the production of the masses has been delayed.
    In order to repair the manure yard and concentrate the manure in the manure yard, Zhang Mingxuan ordered people to level about one point of land with wheat seedlings five or six inches high belonging to the poor peasant Shi Dingwen. Shi Dingwen was very sad and went to Zhang Mingxuan, but Zhang Mingxuan didn't care and said, "This piece of land belongs to the public" (in fact, this piece of land belongs to Shi Dingwen). Shi Dingwen showed the land certificate to Zhang Mingxuan, but Zhang said, "The masses want your land, and even if you have a land certificate, it won't work." Shi Dingwen wanted to report to the county, but Zhang Mingxuan threatened him, saying, "If you dare to make trouble again, I will even open your ancestral grave and use it as a manure yard."
    Next to the ancestral grave of middle peasant Zhang Mingshen was two fen of wasteland. In order to build a road, Zhang Mingxuan ordered people to dig up this two fen of wasteland to build a road without Zhang Mingshen's consent. Zhang Mingshen's father was so angry that he dug up the road again and wanted to repair the wasteland as it was originally. When Shi Zhuosheng, the head of the Culture and Education and Health Section of the County People's Government, found out about this, he forced Zhang Mingshen to repair the road again.
    Under such coercion, the sanitation work in Beisha Village was "very good" on the surface. In order to "demonstrate" and "promote" it, under the personal supervision of Shi Zhuosheng, the head of the Culture and Education and Health Section of the County People's Government, a sanitation observation meeting of tens of thousands of people was organized on April 4th. Three days before the observation meeting, the farmers of Beisha Village were busy day and night going to Wulong Mountain to pick blue soil, whitewashing walls, repairing roads, dismantling quilts, washing clothes... In order to pursue formalistic beauty, they specially painted the walls in the village four feet blue from the ground up, with white borders, and wrote large and small slogans and couplets on the top of the walls and on the thresholds, some with red characters and white borders, and some with red borders and white characters, written very neatly; however, the content of the slogans rarely mentioned production, and most of them were empty slogans such as "Improve Sanitation" and "Sanitation Must Be Improved." Some of the slogans were inappropriate and incomplete, such as "Improving Sanitation Means Loving the Country" and "Start a Sanitation Craze." The farmers had a lot of opinions about such wall painting and slogan writing. They said: What's the use of doing this? It looks good, but it can't be eaten. Poor peasant Zhang Shushen did not have livestock at home, and borrowed livestock from others to plow the land, but Zhang Mingxuan stopped him and said: "If you leave, I will leave, and everyone will leave, who will do the work? Who will be responsible if the observation fails?" Zhang Shushen had no choice but to stay in the village and do sanitation work instead of plowing the land.
    On April 4th, the observation meeting began, and tens of thousands of people from nearby masses and representatives from various districts came; the village's amateur theater troupe also specially performed a big show for a day and a night to join in the fun, which seriously delayed the farmers' production and wasted their money.
    The coercion and formalism in the health work of Beisha Village can develop to such a serious extent is inseparable from the erroneous leadership of Shi Zhuosheng, the head of the Culture and Education and Health Section of Huaxian County, who is responsible for leading the health work. This practice of deviating from reality, deviating from the masses, neglecting to lead farmers' production, not combining with production to carry out health work, and this serious coercion, simply pursuing form, hindering production, and harming the interests of farmers must be seriously corrected.

    陕西省华县人民卫生院干部张明轩等
    强迫农民开展卫生运动妨碍生产必须纠正
    【本报讯】据西安群众日报消息：陕西省华县人民卫生院的干部张明轩等，在领导华县六区三乡北沙村的春季爱国卫生运动中，有很严重的强迫命令和形式主义的作风，妨碍了农民的春季生产，侵犯了农民的利益，因此引起了农民的反对。
    北沙村是华县的一个卫生重点村。今年三月初，县卫生院干部张明轩和李秀霞到该村推动春季爱国卫生运动。一个月中，他们领导全村农民铲除了杂草，清除了垃圾，又把历年积存在城墙上的尘土刮下来送到地里当肥料；街道也比从前干净的多了。
    但是，张明轩等为了一下子就想把北沙村培养成为卫生模范村，竟忽视农村中压倒一切的中心工作是领导生产，他们脱离农村实际，追求表面的整洁，并且用强迫命令的方法来完成任务。
    张明轩等到北沙村后，没有很好地结合生产，发动群众开展爱国卫生工作。他们召集了好几次干部会和群众会，动员大家“掀起爱国卫生工作热潮”。他们错误地提出“用卫生来推动一切”的口号，脱离实际地要求每一个人都要买一个口罩，每家的茅坑都要用砖砌。他们对北沙村去年薄收、春荒比较严重的情况熟视无睹，他们忽视农民最迫切的要求是进行副业生产渡过春荒和进行春耕。因此，他们没有积极领导农民解决春荒和春耕中的困难，反而威胁农民说：“你们村里的坏人多，这次卫生运动就要考验你们，谁不愿搞，谁就是妨碍卫生运动的绊脚石、坏分子。”另外又欺哄群众说：“西北区有一亿三千万元放在那里找卫生模范呢！你们要搞，就是卫生模范村，准能得奖哩。”
    北沙村的爱国卫生运动就这样搞起来了。
    全村二百六十四户，被分成二十四个卫生小组。张明轩为了突击卫生工作，提出生产、卫生、贯彻婚姻法“三不误”的口号，要农民每天早上搞卫生，饭后搞生产，晚上搞婚姻法宣传；又规定了每家每天得抽出一个人来搞卫生工作，不来时要向卫生组长请假，不请假的就罚他到来回三十里远的五龙山去挑蓝土。贫农史恒忠（青年团支部委员）因为家里生活困难，卖菜去了，两早上没搞卫生工作，就被罚挑一百斤蓝土。像这样被罚的有四、五十人。三月中，下了两天雨，麦地里的草长得很快，那些劳动力少的人家，搞卫生就顾不得生产，心里急得很，天一明就偷着跑到地里去做活。张明轩看到搞卫生的人少了，把卫生组长、村长叫来骂道：“你们都当了老爷啦！连群众都叫不来。”后来因为不来的人太多，才不得不把卫生运动停了几天。就这样，群众的生产，已经被耽误了。
    为了修粪场，把粪集中到粪场里，张明轩叫人把贫农史定稳的长了五、六寸高麦苗的约一分地给平了。史定稳心里难过得很，去找张明轩，张明轩毫不在乎地说：“这块地是公家的”（实际上这块地是史定稳的）。史定稳拿土地证给张明轩看，张却说：“群众要你的地，有土地证也不顶事。”史定稳要向县上反映，张明轩就吓唬他说：“你敢再闹，我还要把你的祖坟开了作粪场哩。”
    中农张铭绅的祖坟旁边有二分?地，张明轩为了要修大路，不经张铭绅同意就叫人把这二分?地挖了修大路。张铭绅的父亲气得把路又挖了，要按原样修成?地。这事被县人民政府文教卫生科科长史卓生知道了，硬逼着张铭绅重新把路修好。
    在这样强迫命令下，北沙村的卫生工作，表面上搞得“很好”了，为了“示范”和“推广”，在县人民政府文教卫生科科长史卓生的亲自主持下，在四月四日组织了上万人的卫生观摩大会。在观摩大会的前三天，北沙村的农民就白天黑夜地忙着到五龙山去挑蓝土，刷墙，修路，拆被，洗衣服……。为了追求形式上的好看，特地把村里的墙从地平起刷上四尺蓝色，加上白边，墙顶上和门槛上都写上大的小的标语、对联，有的红字白边，有的红边白字，写的很工整；但是，标语的内容却很少谈到生产，绝大部分都是“要搞好卫生”，“卫生要搞好”之类的空洞口号。有的标语的提法欠妥当，不全面，如“搞好卫生就是爱国家”、“掀起卫生热潮”等。农民对这样的刷墙、写标语很有意见，他们说：弄这个干啥呢？看起来倒罢了，就是不能当饭吃。贫农张书绅家里没有牲口，借了别人的牲口要去犁地，张明轩就阻挡说：“你走，我走，大家都走了，工作交给谁搞？观摩不成谁负这个责任？”张书绅只好不去犁地，留在村里搞卫生。
    四月四日，观摩大会开始了，附近的群众和各区的代表来了上万人；村上的业余剧团还特地演了一天一夜大戏凑热闹，这就更严重地耽搁了农民的生产，浪费了农民的金钱。
    北沙村卫生工作中的强迫命令和形式主义能发展到这么严重的程度，是和华县负责领导卫生工作的文教卫生科科长史卓生的错误领导分不开的。这种脱离实际、脱离群众、忽视领导农民生产，不结合生产来进行卫生工作的作法，这种严重的强迫命令、单纯追求形式、妨碍生产、损害农民利益的作法，必须严肃纠正。
