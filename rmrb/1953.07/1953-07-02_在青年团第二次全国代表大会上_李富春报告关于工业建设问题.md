Xinhua News Agency, July 1st—The Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League continued its session on the morning of the 1st.

    Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, delivered a report to the congress on China's industrial construction issues.

    Li Fuchun said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have spent approximately three years completing the task of economic recovery, and a new period of planned construction in our national economy has arrived. In this new historical period, the task of the Chinese people is to gradually realize the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, in accordance with the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and on this basis, to gradually transition our motherland to socialism. This requires a considerable period of planned construction. He then explained the principles and policies for implementing the First Five-Year Plan.

    Li Fuchun pointed out: The basic task during the period of China's First Five-Year Plan is to concentrate efforts on developing heavy industry, establishing the foundation for national industrialization and the modernization of national defense, and ensuring the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy. Under this overall goal, agriculture and light industry will be developed accordingly, the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts will be actively and systematically promoted, the role of private industry and commerce and individual agriculture and handicrafts will be correctly brought into play, and the material and cultural living standards of the people will be improved on the basis of developing production. To achieve the above basic tasks: First, it must be clearly affirmed that the development of the country's heavy industry is the central link of the Five-Year Plan. Only by building the country's heavy industry can we ensure the consolidation of national defense and the security of the country; can we guarantee China's complete economic independence; can we give light industry broad prospects for development; provide material and technical conditions for the transformation of China's agriculture; and continuously improve the living standards of the people. These are precisely the material foundations for a gradual transition to socialism. At the same time, the country's light industry should also be appropriately developed to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people in production and life. Second, in the process of economic development, the proportion of the socialist economy must continue to grow. This is the fundamental path for China's economic development. Third, further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance should be the starting point for all our plans and policies. Fourth, developing modern transportation is an organizational part of realizing China's industrialization. Without transportation tools such as railways, automobiles, and ships that are adapted to the overall industrial development, there can be no real industrialization in China. Fifth, improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people on the basis of production development. Sixth, China's Five-Year Plan must have certain reserves to cope with changes in circumstances and accidental events, and to prepare conditions for the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Li Fuchun pointed out that, therefore, the Five-Year Plan must focus on developing metallurgy, fuel, electricity, machinery, basic chemicals, national defense and other industries, and at the same time, focus on key points when developing these industries.

    He then explained several issues that deserve special attention in industrial construction, namely: the issue of further strengthening the leadership of basic construction; the issue of fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises; the issue of vigorously training construction cadres; and the issue of practicing strict economy and accumulating funds.

    Li Fuchun concluded by saying: In this new historical period, the members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League should use their exemplary actions to lead all young people on the economic construction front, actively participate in the increase production and practice economy movement, participate in labor competitions, and overfulfill the national plan; it is necessary to actively unite the broad masses of young people, study culture, study science and technology, and pay special attention to learning advanced Soviet science, so as to become active creators of the motherland's construction. Therefore, the Youth League must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and ensure that the youth of the whole country are healthy, study well, and work well, and it is necessary to take care of the characteristics of the youth and carry out systematic work. He continued: We firmly believe that the youth who have grown up under the education of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, will surely be able to undertake this glorious task, and will surely be able to contribute all their energy and creative talents to the great construction cause of the motherland.

    Following this, the congress adopted the report on the examination of proposals.

    In the afternoon, the delegates held group meetings.

    在青年团第二次全国代表大会上
    李富春报告关于工业建设问题
    【新华社一日讯】中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会一日上午继续举行。
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任李富春向大会作了关于中国工业建设问题的报告。
    李富春说：中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，经过了三年左右的时间，已经完成了恢复经济的任务，我国国民经济有计划建设的新时期已经到来了。在这个新的历史时期，我国人民的任务，就是按照毛主席所指示的道路，逐步地实现国家的工业化和农业集体化，并在这个基础上，使我们的祖国逐步地过渡到社会主义。为此，需要一个相当长的时期来进行有计划的建设。他接着就实行第一个五年建设计划的方针、政策等问题作了说明。
    李富春指出：我国第一个五年建设计划时期内的基本任务是：集中力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础，保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步地增长。在这一总的目标之下，相应地发展农业和轻工业，积极地有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化，正确地发挥私营工商业和个体农业、手工业的作用，并在发展生产的基础上提高人民物质和文化生活的水平。为了实现上述基本任务：第一，必须明确肯定发展国家的重工业，是五年建设的中心环节。只有建设国家的重工业，才能保证国防的巩固和国家的安全；才能保证我国在经济上的完全独立；才能给轻工业以广阔的发展前途；给我国农业的改造提供物质的和技术的条件；使人民的生活水平不断的提高。这一些，正是逐步过渡到社会主义的物质基础。同时，还要适当地发展国家的轻工业，来满足城乡人民在生产上和生活上日益增长的需要。第二，在发展经济的过程中，必须使社会主义经济的比重不断得到增长，这是我国发展经济的根本道路。第三，进一步巩固工农联盟，应成为我们一切计划和政策的出发点。第四，发展现代化的交通运输事业，是实现我国工业化的一个组织部分，没有与整个工业发展相适应的铁路、汽车、轮船这一类的交通工具，就谈不上我国的真正工业化。第五，在生产发展的基础上，提高劳动人民物质和文化生活的水平。第六，必须使我国的五年建设计划有一定的后备，以应付情况的变化和偶然的事件，并为第二个五年建设准备条件。
    李富春指出，因此，在五年建设计划中必须着重发展冶金、燃料、电力、机械、基本化学、国防等工业，在发展这些工业时，同时又必须抓住重点。
    他接着就工业建设中特别值得注意的几个问题作了说明，即：进一步加强基本建设领导的问题；充分发挥现在企业的潜在力量的问题；大力培养建设干部的问题；厉行节约和积累基金的问题。
    李富春最后说：在这个新的历史时期，中国新民主主义青年团的团员，应该用自己的模范行动，带领经济建设战线上的全体青年，积极参加增产节约运动，参加劳动竞赛，超额完成国家计划；要积极地团结广大青年，学习文化，学习科学技术，特别要注意学习苏联的先进科学，以成为祖国建设的积极创造者。因此，青年团要遵照毛主席的指示，使全国青年身体好，学习好，工作好，就必须照顾青年的特点，进行系统的工作。他接着说：我们完全相信，在中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教育下成长起来的青年，一定能够将这个光荣的任务担当起来，一定能够将自己的全部精力与创造才能贡献给祖国伟大的建设事业。
    接着，大会通过了提案审查报告。
    今日下午，代表们分别举行小组会议。
