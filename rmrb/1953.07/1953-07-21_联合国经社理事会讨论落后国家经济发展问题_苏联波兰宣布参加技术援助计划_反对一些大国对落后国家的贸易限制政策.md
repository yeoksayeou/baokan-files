Xinhua News Agency: The 16th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council discussed the economic development of underdeveloped countries on July 15, 16, and 17. Representatives of the Soviet Union and Poland announced at the meeting that they would participate in the United Nations technical assistance program for underdeveloped countries starting in 1953.

During the discussion, representatives from Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, and many other underdeveloped countries pointed out that the decline in the prices of goods exported from underdeveloped countries and the rise in the prices of imported goods have greatly harmed the economies of these countries. Therefore, restoring normal international trade is very important for the economic development of underdeveloped countries. They also pointed out that foreign capital investment in underdeveloped countries actually hinders the economic development of these countries.

At the meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council on the morning of July 15, representatives of Yugoslavia, the United States, and the Soviet Union spoke successively on the issue of economic development in underdeveloped countries.

The representatives of Yugoslavia and the United States talked about establishing a special fund for the economic development of underdeveloped countries. The Yugoslav representative advocated the immediate establishment of such a fund, while the US representative suggested that the Economic and Social Council should only adopt a general announcement at this stage.

The Soviet representative, Arutyunyan, pointed out in his speech that in order to promote the economic development of underdeveloped countries, rather than establishing a so-called special fund, it would be better to abolish the trade restrictions imposed by certain major powers on underdeveloped countries and promote trade between underdeveloped countries and other countries. The latter is much more important.

The Soviet representative cited specific examples to illustrate that the restrictions imposed by certain major powers on underdeveloped countries allow these major powers to control the prices of raw materials exported from underdeveloped countries, making market prices greatly favorable to these major powers and more severe and harmful to underdeveloped countries. Arutyunyan said that these restrictions aggravate unequal exchange and harm the national interests of underdeveloped countries. As a result, foreign monopoly capital can acquire raw materials and food at ridiculously low prices and sell goods, usually inferior and unsalable elsewhere, to underdeveloped countries at extremely high prices.

For example, the International Monetary Fund's statistical bulletin of June 1953 shows that in the fourth quarter of 1952, the export prices of Ceylon increased by 3% compared to the first half of 1950, while import prices increased by 35% during the same period. During the same period, the export prices of the Philippines increased by 5%, while import prices increased by 24%.

The policy of imposing trade restrictions on underdeveloped countries has increased the trade deficits of underdeveloped countries, reduced their trade volume, and depleted their gold and foreign exchange reserves. In just one year, from 1951 to 1952, the total export value of underdeveloped countries decreased from 19.7 billion US dollars to 16.8 billion US dollars, a decrease of more than 15%. The export volume of Asian and Far Eastern countries (excluding the People's Republic of China and Japan) shrank even more. The total export value in 1951 was 8.3 billion US dollars, which was reduced to 6.5 billion US dollars in 1952, a reduction of almost 22%.

According to the statistical bulletin of the International Monetary Fund, until 1950, underdeveloped countries in Asia, Latin America, and the Near and Middle East still had a trade surplus of 2.2 billion US dollars. However, in 1952, these countries had a trade deficit of as much as 1.5 billion US dollars.

The Soviet representative said that in order to help the economic development of underdeveloped countries, the best way is not to prevent them from conducting normal trade with other countries so that they can obtain the necessary foreign exchange, rather than giving them some assistance. This assistance has only brought them pain so far. He said that the drafters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East's 1951 Economic Survey of Asia and the Far East also held this view. The report stated that stabilizing the required quantity of raw materials exported for underdeveloped countries is far more important than the existing foreign aid and loans.

The Soviet representative continued by saying that everyone can have sufficient reason to say that in order to help the economic development of underdeveloped countries, it would be better to abolish the trade restrictions imposed by certain major powers on underdeveloped countries, rather than establish a special fund to promote the economic development of underdeveloped countries according to the recommendations of the expert committee. Arutyunyan said that the report submitted by the expert committee to this session of the Economic and Social Council believes that this fund will encourage foreign capital to flow into underdeveloped countries. Past experience has proven that foreign investment in underdeveloped countries usually comes with some conditions. These conditions further worsen the difficult economic situation of underdeveloped countries and facilitate foreign interference in the internal affairs of underdeveloped countries, which is contrary to the principles of the United Nations. The motive for investing in underdeveloped countries is to seek maximum profits, not for the benefit of underdeveloped countries at all.

Arutyunyan then gave examples to show that the huge profits obtained by foreign monopolists after exporting capital to underdeveloped countries often exceed the original investment. Therefore, it is not the countries that export capital that are subsidizing underdeveloped countries; on the contrary, underdeveloped countries have become a source of capital accumulation, which foreign countries then invest back into underdeveloped countries as foreign capital. For example, according to the materials from the 1951-1952 Economic Survey of Latin American Countries compiled by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the total foreign capital invested in Latin American countries from 1945 to 1952 was 2,009 million US dollars. During the same period, the total amount of dividends and interest exploited by foreign capital from Latin American countries was 5,829 million US dollars, and foreign capital also recovered a principal of 1,310 million US dollars in Latin American countries during these years. Therefore, from 1945 to 1952, the actual foreign investment in Latin American countries was only 780 million US dollars.

Arutyunyan said that this is the truth. It is not only the case in Latin America, but also in countries in Asia, the Middle East, and any other region.

Arutyunyan said that foreign capital can only play a certain role in the economic development of underdeveloped countries as a supplementary source and only by following a rational policy that does not harm the interests of underdeveloped countries or interfere in their internal affairs.

The Soviet representative pointed out that providing underdeveloped countries with the necessary technical assistance is very important for their economic development. The issue of technical assistance to underdeveloped countries occupies an important position in the activities of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Like the United Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council has discussed this issue more than once. At the ninth session of the Economic and Social Council, with the active participation of the Soviet representative, the main principles for providing technical assistance to develop the economies of underdeveloped countries were formulated. Like many other member states of the United Nations, the Soviet Union has always supported the proposal to allocate a certain amount of funds from the United Nations budget as technical assistance expenses for underdeveloped countries.

Arutyunyan said that currently, the Soviet Union is ready to participate in providing technical assistance to underdeveloped countries in accordance with the United Nations expanded technical assistance program. The Soviet Union believes that the technical assistance provided to underdeveloped countries must promote the development of these countries' internal resources and the development of national industry and agriculture, promote the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, and thus help these countries achieve economic independence. Countries providing assistance to underdeveloped countries must not demand economic, political, or other privileges as conditions for assistance.

The Soviet representative said that based on the above, the Soviet Union is prepared to participate in the United Nations technical assistance program for underdeveloped countries, and the Soviet Union is prepared to allocate 4 million rubles in 1953 as United Nations technical assistance funds.

The Soviet Union's willingness to participate in the implementation of a broad technical assistance program for underdeveloped countries is based on the desire to continue to promote the development and consolidation of international economic cooperation in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.

Arutyunyan finally talked about the statement made by the US representative at the Council meeting on July 15. He pointed out that the Soviet delegation welcomes the US representative's statement that the US government is striving to strengthen peace. However, such rhetoric is not supported by facts, and on the issue of providing economic assistance to underdeveloped countries, the US-led group is inconsistent in word and deed. The Soviet representative cited some remarks by American figures, which show that the US ruling group intends to use the so-called assistance to foreign countries to further deteriorate international relations. For example, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Wiley said in the Senate on June 29 this year that assistance to foreign countries will promote the explosion of the powder kegs in Eastern Europe and China.

The Soviet Union's statement that it is prepared to participate in the implementation of the United Nations technical assistance program for underdeveloped countries deeply impressed the representatives of various countries participating in the Economic and Social Council meeting.

The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, fully supported the Soviet Union's position. He emphasized that the Soviet Union's participation in the technical assistance program will not only make the program more effective, but also further guarantee that the implementation of the program complies with the principles of the United Nations and truly benefits the interests of underdeveloped countries. The Polish representative also announced that the government of the People's Republic of Poland has decided to allocate 300,000 zlotys (Polish currency) in 1953 as funds for the United Nations technical assistance to underdeveloped countries.

    联合国经社理事会讨论落后国家经济发展问题
    苏联波兰宣布参加技术援助计划
    反对一些大国对落后国家的贸易限制政策
    据新华社讯：联合国经社理事会第十六届会议在七月十五、十六、十七日讨论落后国家的经济发展问题。苏联及波兰代表在会上宣布自一九五三年起参加联合国技术援助落后国家计划。
    在讨论过程中，印尼、智利、阿根廷及其他许多落后国家代表发言指出，落后国家出口货物价格的下跌和进口货物价格的上涨，使这些国家经济受到很大危害。因此，恢复正常国际贸易对落后国家经济发展十分重要。他们并指出，外国资本对落后国家的投资，实际上阻挠了这些国家经济的发展。
    在联合国经社理事会七月十五日上午的会议上，南斯拉夫、美国和苏联代表相继就落后国家的经济发展问题发言。
    南斯拉夫代表和美国代表谈到要设立一项用以发展落后国家经济的特别基金。南斯拉夫代表主张立即设立这种基金，而美国代表建议经社理事会在现阶段仅应通过一个一般的公告。
    苏联代表阿鲁纠尼安在发言中指出：为了促进落后国家的经济发展，与其来设立所谓特别基金，倒不如取消某些大国对落后国家实行的贸易限制，促进落后国家与其他国家的贸易。后者才是重要得多的事情。
    苏联代表列举一些具体例子说明，某些大国对落后国家实行的限制使这些大国能够控制落后国家输出的原料的价格，使市场价格对这些大国大大有利，而对落后国家更加严重，极为有害。阿鲁纠尼安说：这种限制使不等价交换更加严重，危害了落后国家的民族利益。结果，外国垄断资本便可用低得可怜的价钱来收购原料和粮食，而以极高的价格把通常是劣等的、在别处销售不掉的货物，推销到落后国家去。
    例如，国际货币基金组织一九五三年六月的统计公报说明：在一九五二年第四季度，锡兰出口货价格比一九五○年上半年的出口价格增加百分之三，而同时期内入口货价格却增加了百分之三十五。在同一时期，菲律宾的出口货价格增加了百分之五，而入口货价格增加了百分之二十四。
    对落后国家实行贸易限制的政策使落后国家的对外贸易入超增加，贸易额减少，黄金与外汇储备耗竭。仅在一九五一年到一九五二年一年中，落后国家的出口总值便从一百九十七亿美元减少为一百六十八亿美元，减少百分之十五以上。亚洲和远东国家（中华人民共和国和日本除外）的出口量缩减得更多。一九五一年出口总值为八十三亿美元，一九五二年便减为六十五亿美元，几乎削减了百分之二十二。
    根据国际货币基金组织的统计公报，直到一九五○年为止，亚洲、拉丁美洲和近中东的落后国家还有二十二亿美元的贸易顺差。但是在一九五二年，这些国家就有了数达十五亿美元的贸易逆差。
    苏联代表说，为了帮助落后国家经济发展，最好的办法是不要阻止它们和其他国家进行正常的贸易，以使它们获得必要的外汇，而不是给它们一些援助。这些援助直到如今只给它们带来了痛苦。他说，联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会一九五一年亚洲及远东经济调查报告书的起草人也抱着这样的看法。报告书中说，把对于落后国家的出口原料的需要数量稳定下来，远比现有的外国援助和贷款重要。
    苏联代表接着说，每个人可以有充分的理由说，要帮助落后国家的经济发展，与其按照专家委员会的建议设立一项促进落后国家经济发展的特别基金，倒不如取消某些大国对落后国家的贸易限制。阿鲁纠尼安说，专家委员会向经社理事会本届会议提出的报告书中认为，此项基金将鼓舞外国资本流入落后国家。过去的经验证明，外国在落后国家投资通常有一些条件。这些条件使落后国家困难的经济境况进一步恶化，并且便于外国干涉落后国家的内政，这是违背联合国的原则的。对落后国家投资的动机是为了谋取最大限度的利润，根本不是为了落后国家的利益。
    阿鲁纠尼安接着举例表明，外国垄断资本家向落后国家输出资本后获得的巨额利润常常超过原来的投资，因此事实上并不是那些输出资本的国家在资助落后国家，恰恰相反，倒是那些落后国家成了积累资本的泉源，然后外国又把这些积累起来的资本作为外国资本投回到落后国家去。例如，根据联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会编制的一九五一年至一九五二年度拉丁美洲各国经济调查报告书的材料，从一九四五年到一九五二年输入拉丁美洲各国的外国资本共有二十亿零九千万美元。在同一时期内，外国资本从拉丁美洲国家剥削去的红利和利息总额共达五十八亿二千九百万美元，而且，在这几年中外国资本在拉丁美洲国家还收回了本钱十三亿一千万美元。所以，从一九四五年到一九五二年，投向拉丁美洲各国的外国投资实际上只有七亿八千万美元。
    阿鲁纠尼安说，这就是事实的真相。不仅在拉丁美洲是如此，在亚洲、中东和任何地区的国家也都是如此。
    阿鲁纠尼安说，外国资本只有作为一种辅助的来源，只有遵循不损害落后国家的利益、不干涉它们的内政的合理方针，才能对发展落后国家的经济起
    一定的作用。
    苏联代表指出，给予落后国家以必要的技术援助对其经济发展是很重要的。技术援助落后国家问题在联合国经社理事会的活动中占着重要的位置。像联合国大会一样，经社理事会曾不止一次地讨论过这个问题。经社理事会第九届会议在苏联代表的积极参加之下拟订了给予技术援助以发展落后国家经济的主要原则。像其他许多联合国会员国一样，苏联一向支持这样的提案，就是从联合国预算中拨出一定数目的款项作为对落后国家的技术援助费用。
    阿鲁纠尼安说，目前，苏联已准备按照联合国扩大的技术援助计划，参加给予落后国家以技术援助的工作。苏联认为给予落后国家的技术援助必需使其促进这些国家内部资源的开发和民族工业和农业的发展，促使人民的物质与文化生活水平的提高，从而有助于这些国家获得经济独立。给予落后国家以援助的国家不得要求经济、政治或其它特权来作为援助的条件。
    苏联代表说，根据以上所述，苏联准备参加联合国技术援助落后国家计划，苏联准备在一九五三年拨款四百万卢布作为联合国技术援助经费。
    苏联所以愿意参加执行广泛的技术援助落后国家的计划是基于这样的愿望，就是希望继续按照联合国的原则，促进国际经济合作的发展与巩固。
    阿鲁纠尼安最后谈到美国代表七月十五日在理事会会议上的发言。他指出，苏联代表团欢迎美国代表表示美国政府为加强和平而努力的发言。不过，这种言论没有得到事实的证明，而在给予落后国家经济援助这个问题上，美国领导的集团是言行不一致的。苏联代表举出一些美国人士的言论，这些言论说明美国统治集团打算用给予外国的所谓援助来使国际关系更加恶化。例如美国参议院外交委员会主席维利今年六月二十九日在参议院说，给予外国的援助将促进东欧国家和中国的火药桶爆炸。
    苏联准备参加执行联合国技术援助落后国家计划的声明，使参加经社理事会会议的各国代表获得极深的印象。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希完全支持苏联的主张。他强调指出，苏联参加技术援助计划，不仅会使这个计划更为有效，并且会更加保证计划的执行符合联合国的原则并确实有利于落后国家的利益。波兰代表并且宣布波兰人民共和国政府决定在一九五三年拨出三十万兹罗提（波币名）作为联合国技术援助落后国家的经费。
