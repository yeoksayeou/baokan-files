    A Circuit Court Serving Agricultural Production
    Wang Shirang
    Under the unified arrangements of the CPC Fumin County Committee, the Fumin County People's Court of Yunnan Province studied the documents related to agricultural production work issued by the CPC Central Committee in April this year. This enabled cadres to clearly recognize that agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural areas, thereby strengthening the view that judicial work must serve production. On May 21st, the county People's Court dispatched a circuit court to Beiying Township in the Second District. Closely integrated with spring plowing and drought resistance to protect seedlings, the court conducted trials on the spot, using legal weapons to protect and promote production and construction, which was widely welcomed by farmers.
    Beiying Township is twenty miles from the county seat and has nine natural villages under its jurisdiction. The farthest village is fifteen miles from the township government, and most are two to seven miles away. When the circuit court arrived, the entire township was actively engaged in drought resistance and seedling protection. The court cadres had made preparations in advance, recognizing that this round of trials in the countryside could not adopt the "big push" and "big drumbeat" approach of extensively mobilizing the masses in the past. Work must be closely integrated with production during the slack season to be effective. Under the unified leadership of the township government, they took the initiative to cooperate with the production work team, living, studying, and working together. First, they asked the production work team to introduce the local production situation, and found two main problems that directly affected production: (1) One hundred and one *gongban* seedlings in the township had been dried out, and the farmers were very anxious, waiting for water in the fields during the day and unable to sleep at night due to worry. As a result, everyone was competing for water to save the seedlings, leading to the most disputes. (2) There were many marriage and family disputes, which affected the farmers' production morale. The production work team found these two problems very difficult. The head of the production work team said to the court cadres, "This is great, you are here, I can eat two more bowls of rice, help us deal with them!"
    Based on the above situation, the court cadres decided on the specific steps to deal with the disputes: in coordination with the drought resistance and seedling protection work, prioritize according to urgency, first water conservancy, then marriage, and then others. After this decision, four cadres toured thirteen villages, some villages two or three times, walking more than two hundred *li*, and dealt with thirty-four cases. Among them, there were nine water conservancy disputes and seven marriage disputes, involving a total of eighty parties and eight witnesses. If these cases were all summoned to the county for trial, in addition to the round-trip travel and meal expenses for the parties and witnesses, even if only one day of missed work was calculated for each person, eighty-eight days of labor would be wasted. Using this labor to transplant rice seedlings, at least eighty-eight *gong* of fields could be transplanted. This shows that the circuit court going to the countryside not only greatly facilitated the farmers, but also saved them a lot of time and money, which is of great benefit to production. More importantly, the court correctly used legal weapons to resolve disputes among the masses in a timely manner and punished illegal acts that undermined production, thereby effectively protecting and promoting agricultural production. For example, the resolution of the water conservancy dispute in Yishe Village is the best example. There is a ditch of water in this area that is more than twenty *li* long, and the 3,940 *gong* of fields in five villages including Yishe rely on it for irrigation, but the water source is in the mountainous area of Zehe Village. However, the farmers in Zehe Village held the idea that "three years of being an official is not as good as having the water source in front," and were unwilling to let more water down, so the seedlings in eighty-three *gong* of fields in the five villages were suffering from drought, and some fields were even cracking open. The farmers in the five villages were very anxious. After the court learned about this situation, it immediately went deep into the fields and water source with the production work team and the water conservancy committees of each village, running back and forth forty or fifty *li* day and night. After clarifying the situation, the court mediated the dispute. The court cadres emphasized the impact of feudal water regulations on production, and patiently conducted education on "farmers all over the world are one family, unite to do a good job in production." As a result, the thinking of the farmers in Zehe Village was straightened out, the water use problem was reasonably resolved, and the seedlings of eighty-three *gong* of fields were protected. For example, Yang Chaozhang, a rich peasant in Yishe Village, deliberately violated the regulations on rational water use, ignoring the life and death of the masses' seedlings, and secretly watered eight *gong* of dry fields, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The court immediately gave him legal sanctions and fined him 100,000 yuan. Through this typical case, the village cadres carried out propaganda and education to the masses, so no more incidents of sabotaging water conservancy occurred in Yishe and Dasanlong villages. The masses reflected, "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries only cared about collecting grain and did not care about our production; today, the court goes to the countryside and resolves water conservancy disputes. This is the goodness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's leadership!"
    The circuit court also promptly and correctly handled some marriage disputes, thereby increasing the farmers' enthusiasm for production. For example, after Wang Cuilan, a poor peasant woman in Yishe Village, married Wang Jialiu, they often quarreled because both parties were dissatisfied with the feudal arranged marriage; the man slept in every day and did not work, the woman made a lot of noise, and they did not produce or eat together. After the court arrived in the village, the woman proposed a divorce. After investigation and understanding, the court cadres believed that the two parties could not continue to live together, so they mediated and ruled for divorce. Both parties were very happy. The man said, "Now that the matter is resolved, I have the energy to produce!" The woman also said that in addition to actively participating in production, she would weave two straw hats a day.
    In short, through this round of circuit trials in the countryside, the cadres of the Fumin County People's Court have further recognized the importance of judicial work serving production, and the circuit court is the best organizational form for completing this task. Therefore, they believe that the circuit court must be improved on the existing basis, and in the future, circuit trials should be conducted in the countryside regularly according to the rural production season.

    一个为农业生产服务的巡回法庭
    王士让
    云南省富民县人民法院在中共富民县委的统一布置下，在今年四月学习了中共中央发布的有关农业生产工作的文件，使干部明确地认识到农业生产是农村中压倒一切的中心工作，从而加强了司法工作必须为生产服务的观点。五月二十一日，县人民法院派出巡回法庭，深入第二区北营乡，密切结合春耕生产和抗旱保苗工作，就地进行审判，用法律武器保护和推动了生产建设，受到了农民的普遍欢迎。
    北营乡距县城二十里，共辖自然村九个。最远的村离乡政府十五里，一般是二里到七里。巡回法庭到达时，全乡正积极展开抗旱保苗工作。法庭干部事前有了思想准备，认识到这次下乡审判，不能采取过去广泛发动群众的“大轰”“大擂”的方式，必须利用农闲，密切结合生产，工作才会作得好。他们在乡政府的统一领导下，主动地和生产工作组配合起来，生活、学习、工作都在一起。先请生产工作组介绍了当地的生产情况，发现了两个直接影响生产的主要问题：（一）全乡已有一百零一个工半苗田晒干，农民非常着急，白天到田里盼水；夜里愁的不能睡觉。因而大家争水救苗，纠纷最多。（二）婚姻、家庭纠纷多，影响了农民的生产情绪。生产工作组对这两个问题感到很大困难。生产工作组的组长对法庭的干部说：“这下可好了，你们下来，我多吃了两碗饭，帮着我们处理处理吧！”
    根据以上情况，法庭的干部决定了处理纠纷的具体步骤：配合抗旱保苗工作，分别轻重缓急，先水利，次婚姻，后其他。这样决定以后，四个干部分别巡回了十三个村子，有的村跑了两、三次，走了二百多里路，处理了三十四件案子。内有水利纠纷九件，婚姻纠纷七件，共到当事人八十名，证人八名。如把这些案件都传到县上审判，除了当事人和证人往返的路费和伙食费不算外，只拿每人误工一个计算，就要浪费人工八十八个。用这些人工栽秧，最低可栽八十八个工田。由此说明，巡回法庭下乡，不仅大大地便利了农民，也节省了农民大量的时间和金钱，对生产有很大的好处。更重要的是，法庭正确地运用法律武器及时解决了群众间的纠纷，制裁了破坏生产的违法行为，因而有效地保护和推动了农业生产。如矣摄村的水利纠纷案的解决，就是一个最好的例子。这一带有股水长二十多里，矣摄等五村的三千九百四十个工田，都靠它灌溉，但水源在则核村的山区。而则核村的农民却存在着“作官三年，不如水口在前”的思想，不肯多让一些水下来，因而五个村已有八十三个工田的秧苗受旱，部分田甚至已晒裂了大缝。五个村的农民非常着急。法庭了解这一情况后，立即和生产工作组和各村的水利委员一起深入田间、水源，不分昼夜，来回跑了四五十里路。在情况了解清楚以后，法庭就对这一纠纷进行调解。法庭的干部着重说明了封建水规对生产的影响，并耐心地进行了“天下农民是一家，团结搞好生产”的教育，结果打通了则核村农民的思想，合理地解决了用水问题，保住了八十三个工田的秧苗。又如矣摄村富农杨朝章故意破坏合理用水的规定，不顾群众的秧苗的死活，偷偷地泡了八个工干田，引起群众的不满。法庭立即给了他以法律制裁，判了他十万元的罚金。并通过这个典型案件，由乡村干部向群众展开宣传教育，因而矣摄、大三龙各村再没有发生破坏水利的事件。群众反映说：“过去国民党反动派只管要粮，不管我们生产上的事；今天法庭下乡，解决了水利纠纷，这是共产党、毛主席领导的好！”
    巡回法庭还及时正确地处理了一些婚姻纠纷，从而提高了农民的生产积极性。如矣摄村贫农妇女王翠兰与王加刘结婚后，因双方都不满意封建包办婚姻，经常吵闹；男方整天睡懒觉，不干活计，女方闹死闹活，生产、吃饭都不在一起。法庭到村后，女方提出要离婚，法庭的干部经过调查了解，认为双方确实无法继续在一起生活下去，便经过调解判决离婚。双方都很喜欢，男方说：“这回事情解决了，生产才有劲！”女方也说她除了积极参加生产以外，一天还要编两顶草帽。
    总之，通过这次下乡巡回审判，富民县人民法院的干部已进一步认识到司法工作为生产服务的重要性，而巡回法庭则是完成这一任务的最好的组织形式。因此，他们认为必须把巡回法庭从现有的基础上提高一步，今后要根据农村生产的季节，定期下乡巡回审判。
