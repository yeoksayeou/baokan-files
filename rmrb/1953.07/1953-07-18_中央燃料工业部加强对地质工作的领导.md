The Central Fuel Industry Ministry Strengthens Leadership over Geological Work

The Central People's Government Ministry of Fuel Industry has adopted various effective measures to strengthen leadership over geological work.

Geological work is crucial for fuel industry construction. Coal mines, oil fields, and hydroelectric power stations all require thorough geological surveys to understand geological resources before comprehensive and long-term development plans and accurate designs can be made. The Ministry of Fuel Industry's leadership previously lacked sufficient awareness of this, and failed to take strong measures to strengthen geological work when expanding basic construction forces. As a result, geological work became a weak link, and basic construction and production were seriously affected because geological work could not meet the needs. Firstly, due to the weakness of geological work, the design departments were not able to provide correct and complete geological data in a timely manner, which caused a series of wasted efforts in design and construction, affecting the realization of construction plans. For example, the design and construction of eight new mines and more than forty restored and rebuilt mines entrusted to the Soviet Union were repeatedly delayed because geological data could not be delivered. The Beijing Coal Mine Design Company had eighteen design tasks this year, but geological data for fifteen of them has not been settled, making design work impossible. These wasted efforts in design and construction not only cause huge waste of manpower and financial resources, but also endanger the state's construction plans. Secondly, the poor quality of geological work and the incorrect geological data provided for design resulted in many fundamental errors in design and construction. For example, according to incorrect geological data, the original design of the Xi'an Taidong New Third Inclined Shaft had a reserve of 2.5 million tons, with an investment of 14 billion yuan. Now it has been found that the coal seam in the folded zone is thinning, and it is estimated that the reserve is only 580,000 tons, which can only be mined for three years at most, and is obviously not worth developing. The Huangtankou Hydropower Station in Zhejiang Province also failed to clarify the geological conditions and mistakenly designed the dam on a soft soil layer, causing huge waste in construction and putting the building in an irreparable and unreasonable state. Many mines in coal mine construction have made wrong designs and constructions due to incorrect geological data, causing huge losses to the country. There are such examples in Huainan Coal Mine and Fuxin Coal Mine. The weakness of geological work has also affected production, especially coal mine production. If the geological conditions are unclear, underground development will inevitably be very blind, mining the lower layer while discarding the upper layer, and mining the depth while discarding the two wings, resulting in damage to the mine's production capacity and wasting a large amount of underground resources. For example, the Huainan Coal Mine has abundant coal reserves underground, but the geological structure is complex and there are many faults. When encountering faults, mining was stopped due to the lack of geological guidance, resulting in a large amount of coal being discarded. Similar situations also exist in the construction of the petroleum industry. Although the petroleum industry has long placed its main strength in geological exploration, it has also underestimated the special complexity of petroleum geology, so that the structure and resources of the old oil fields in the Northwest and many newly discovered new oil fields cannot be quickly clarified, which has affected the progress of construction work.

The Ministry of Fuel Industry has now paid attention to the problem of geological work. In April this year, it organized seventeen inspection teams to go to major regions to inspect basic construction work, and further discovered some serious situations in the above-mentioned geological work. Now they have taken various effective measures to vigorously strengthen leadership. Their first step is to improve the organization and correct the past situation of decentralized geological work forces and unconcentrated leadership. The ministry has established a geological department to strengthen the ministry's leadership over geological work. The Coal Mine Management Bureau expanded the original geological department to establish a geological exploration bureau, and the Petroleum Administration established a geological bureau and a drilling bureau to strengthen unified professional leadership. In addition, they are also trying to expand the geological work force from all aspects. First, they will transfer a group of mining engineering personnel from the production department, give them short-term training, and then participate in geological work. At the same time, they will mobilize some design personnel to go directly to the site to assist the geological department in collecting and organizing geological data. They are also preparing to hold short-term training courses under the guidance of Soviet experts, combined with current tasks, to train existing geological workers in a planned way to improve their technical level. In order to improve the quality of coal mine drilling, a national coal mine drilling conference was held in Fuxin in April to exchange and summarize past experience in drilling. This conference played a great role in improving drilling quality. The erroneous tendency of one-sidedly pursuing efficiency and neglecting quality has been basically corrected in various places, and the quality of engineering has been significantly improved. The core recovery rate of the five coal mines in North China, Datong, Jingxi, Jingxing, Yangquan, and Fengfeng, all exceeded the national standard in May (the national requirement is 55% to 60%), and the coal core recovery rate of all coal mines in North China exceeded the national requirement (the national requirement is 50%), which is a very gratifying phenomenon.

### 中央燃料工业部加强对地质工作的领导

    中央燃料工业部加强对地质工作的领导
    中央人民政府燃料工业部采取各种有效措施，开始加强对地质工作的领导。
    地质工作是燃料工业建设中具有决定意义的工作，开采煤矿、石油和建筑水力发电站等，都必须进行周密的地质勘测工作，搞清地质资源之后，才可能作出全面的、符合长远利益的开发计划和正确的设计。燃料工业部领导上过去对这点认识不足，在壮大基本建设力量时没有及早采取有力的措施加强地质工作，地质工作形成了薄弱的一环，结果使基本建设和生产都因为地质工作不能适应需要而受到了严重影响。首先是由于地质工作薄弱，不能及时向设计部门提出正确完备的地质资料，就造成了设计、施工一系列的窝工现象，影响了建设计划的实现。例如过去委托苏联设计的八处新建矿井和四十余处恢复改建的矿井，因为交不出地质资料，使设计施工一再推迟。北京煤矿设计公司今年设计任务为十八件，但其中有十五件地质资料至今没有着落，设计工作就无法进行。设计施工的一系列窝工，不但造成人力财力的巨大浪费，更使得国家建设计划有陷于落空的危险。其次是由于地质工作质量差，提供设计的地质资料不正确，结果造成设计和施工上许多根本性的错误。如西安泰东新三斜井根据不正确的地质资料，原设计埋藏量为二百五十万吨，已投资一百四十亿元，现在发现褶皱地带煤层变薄，据计算埋藏量只有五十八万吨，至多只能采三年，显然不值得开采。浙江黄坛口水电站也因未弄清地质情况，把水坝错误地设计在软土层上，在施工中造成巨大浪费，并使建筑物陷于无可挽回的不合理状态。煤矿建设中不少矿由于地质资料不正确而作了错误的设计和施工，给国家造成巨大损失，淮南煤矿、阜新煤矿都有这类例子。地质工作薄弱也使生产受到了影响，特别是煤矿生产，如果对地质情况不明，井下开拓就必然带有很大盲目性，采了下层而丢了上层，采了纵深而丢了两翼，结果破坏了矿井的生产能力，浪费了大量地下资源。例如淮南煤矿，地下藏煤还很丰富，只是地质构造复杂，断层多，遇到断层时因没有地质工作指导，便停止了采煤，结果大量的煤被丢了。在石油工业建设上也有类似的情况，石油工业建设上虽然很早就把主要力量放在地质探勘方面，但对石油地质的特殊复杂性也认识不足，以致对西北地区的老油田和新发现的许多新油田的构造和资源不能很快弄清，影响了建设工作的进行。
    燃料工业部现在已对地质工作问题引起重视，今年四月间组织了十七个检查组，分赴各大区检查基本建设工作，更进一步发现了上述地质工作方面的一些严重情况，现在他们已采取各种有效措施，大力加强领导。他们首先是健全组织，纠正过去地质工作力量分散，领导不集中的状况。部里成立了地质处，加强部对地质工作的领导。煤矿管理总局把过去的地质处扩大成立了地质探勘局，石油管理局成立了地质局及钻探局，以加强统一的专业领导。另外他们还正从各方面设法壮大地质工作力量，首先是从生产部门抽调一批采矿工程人员，加以短期训练后参加地质工作，同时并动员部分设计人员直接到现场协助地质部门搜集并整理地质资料。他们还准备在苏联专家的指导下举办短期训练班，结合当前任务，有计划地轮训现有地质工作人员，以提高技术水平。为了提高煤矿钻探工作的质量，四月间曾在阜新召开了全国煤矿钻探会议，交流和总结了过去钻探工作方面的经验，这次会议对改进钻探质量起了很大作用，现各地片面追求效率忽视质量的错误倾向基本上已得到纠正，工程质量显著提高，华北大同、京西、井陉、阳泉、峰峰等五个煤矿五月份岩芯采取率都超过了国家要求的标准（国家要求是百分之五十五到六十），煤芯采取率华北各煤矿全部超过了国家要求（国家要求是百分之五十），这是一种很可喜的现象。
