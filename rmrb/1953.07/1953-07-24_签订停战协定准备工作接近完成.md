Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 23rd. Special correspondent Wu Min reports: Preparations for signing the armistice agreement appear to be nearing completion in Panmunjom today, while the Syngman Rhee government's clamor to sabotage the armistice is becoming increasingly intense.

    The staff officers who have been studying the maps since July 20th held a very long meeting. This meeting started at 10:00 AM yesterday and did not end until 1:45 AM today, with only a few short recesses in between. At around 1:30 AM this morning, reporters saw them writing on maps in the brightly lit conference room.

    Despite the intermittent rain, the busy preparations continued today in Panmunjom. Another group of staff officers held a meeting for more than two and a half hours, after which liaison officers met at 3:00 PM to resolve the remaining administrative details. Another group of Korean, Chinese, and American officials conducted what appeared to be a joint inspection of a certain location within the Panmunjom meeting area. A similar inspection was conducted when the two sides selected the location for accommodating sick and wounded prisoners of war in April of this year.

    The newly built, towering T-shaped hall for the signing ceremony now dwarfs the current conference room. In just four days, Korean and Chinese workers have installed glass windows and doors on the Korean-style building with upturned eaves. New roads and a parking lot have been built outside the building. Korean and Chinese trucks are constantly transporting supplies for the rapidly progressing construction project.

    Despite the above indications at Panmunjom, whether the armistice agreement can be signed and whether the armistice can be realized, compared to before, depends even more on whether the U.S. side can fulfill the guarantees it recently made, due to the new clamor against the armistice issued by Syngman Rhee and his lackeys. The greatest vigilance is still needed to sign the armistice agreement.

### 签订停战协定准备工作接近完成

    签订停战协定准备工作接近完成
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：签订停战协定的准备工作今天看来在板门店已经快要完成，同时李承晚政府破坏停战的叫嚣也越来越起劲。
    自从七月二十日以来一直在研究地图的参谋人员，举行了一次很长的会议。这次会议从昨天上午十点钟开始，到今天上午一点四十五分才结束，中间仅有几次短短的休会。在今晨一点半左右，记者看见他们在灯光明亮的会议室内在地图上书写。
    尽管天在断断续续地下雨，忙碌的准备工作今天仍在板门店继续进行。另一组参谋官员开了两个半钟头以上的会议，以后联络官员们在下午三点钟开会，解决剩下的行政细节问题。另一组朝鲜、中国和美国的官员们对于板门店会议地址区内的某一处地点进行了一次似乎是联合的视察。当双方在今年四月间选择收容病伤战俘的地址时，也曾作过同样的视察。
    新建的作为举行签字仪式之用的高大的丁字形的大厅，现在使得目前的会议室相形见绌了。只不过经过四天的功夫，朝鲜和中国的工人们已经在那带有飞檐的朝鲜式的建筑物上安装玻璃窗与门户了。建筑物的外面修有新的道路和一处停车场。朝鲜和中国的卡车川流不息地运输供应物品，作为飞快进行的建筑工程之用。
    尽管板门店有了以上的各种迹象，但是由于李承晚及其走狗们又发出反对停战的新的叫嚣，所以停战协定能否签订以及停战能否实现，和以前比较起来，更要看美方是否能履行它最近所提的保证了。要签订停战协定，还需要最大的警惕。
