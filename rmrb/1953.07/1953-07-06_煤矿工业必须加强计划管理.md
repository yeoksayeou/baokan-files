The situation of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration's implementation of the national plan in the first quarter shows that the progress of production and construction is uneven, and potential has not been fully exploited.

In terms of production: most cyclical charts and schedules have failed, and monthly output has been lax at the beginning and tight at the end. For example, based on the average of January and March, the output in the last ten days of the month was 32.6% higher than in the first ten days, but the monthly plan was not completed. The balance between coal mining preparation and production is also not in place. As of early March, only 75.2% of the tunneling task had been completed.

In terms of construction: only 39% of the first quarter's plan was completed. The best, Fuxin Mine, only completed 61%. Twelve of the sixteen major projects, including vertical shafts, open-pit mines, inclined shafts, and general machinery plants, did not complete the quarterly plan, and five of them were less than 50% of the planned amount. From the internal perspective of the projects, the various sub-projects are not coordinated. For example, at the end of March, the stripping volume of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine had exceeded 3 million cubic meters of the transferred production plan, but the railway project to ensure further development only completed 13.3% of the quarterly plan.

The potential of enterprises has not been fully exploited. Looking at the utilization of mechanical equipment, the overall production machinery utilization rate only reached 59%, and the four major machines were at 47% (number of units). In terms of coal mining machinery, the combined efficiency of the coal combine only reached 45% of the plan, a decrease of 41% compared to 1952; the efficiency of the coal cutter only reached 66% of the plan, even lower than the same period last year. The use of drilling rigs is even worse. The pure drilling time in January and February only accounted for 22.5% of the total working time. In Hegang, the pure drilling time in January and February only accounted for 14% of the total working time.

The above situation has seriously affected production and construction, and has also increased accidents. In the first quarter, only six of the eleven bureaus completed the output plan, and none of the construction plans were completed. The drilling plan only completed 64.7% of the task in January and February. Because of the laxity at the beginning and the rush at the end, workers were exhausted from the rush, neglected safety, and machinery was not inspected or repaired as it should have been, resulting in continuous personal and mechanical accidents. There were 39 major accidents in the first quarter; drilling was dealing with accidents all day long. In Hegang, the accident rate in January and February reached 56%, equivalent to a drilling rig not working for one year and sixteen days; in Fushun, three drilling rigs were dealing with accidents for the entire month of February.

What are the reasons for the above situation? Some leading cadres emphasize objective difficulties, believing that large working faces do not have the conditions for cyclical operations; untimely material supply, frequent failures of mechanical and electrical equipment, and low attendance rates, etc. They think that these are insurmountable difficulties. They do not know that this situation is the result of a lack of planned management or unsound planned management.

The current situation of planned management in Northeast coal mines is quite chaotic: the plans of some units are compiled behind closed doors. They are perfunctory and bargain with the superiors; they are clueless and blindly discount with the subordinates. In implementing the plan, the concept that the plan is the law is very vague, and there is no specific operational plan to guarantee the realization of the plan. Some cadres believe that "planning is planning, and work is work."

Some workers believe that the plan is "bullshit" and "tofu." Many workers do not know their tasks. The leadership regards discussing the plan every quarter and month as a routine matter, raising their hands to pass it when the time comes. As for how to tap potential and solve key problems, they rarely ask about it or limit themselves to general appeals. There is little or no inspection of the implementation of the plan. The construction planning section of some bureaus does not master the annual construction plan and never checks the implementation of the plan. The statistics section of each bureau only manages to summarize the figures and does not analyze and study them.

Therefore, formulating advanced and feasible operation plans based on the discussion of the national plan and supervising its implementation, and strengthening planned management, is an important task for Northeast coal mines at present. For example, the stripping work of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine has achieved preliminary results because it has formulated a relatively complete operation plan and mastered the daily plan and dispatch management, which further confirms the superiority of this advanced Soviet enterprise management experience.

In implementing planned management, Northeast coal mines should pay attention to the following points according to the specific conditions of their units:

\tI. First of all, we must establish the concept of planning. In the leadership, we must not treat the national plan with a bureaucratic attitude, and use this to educate cadres and all employees. We must not "retreat in the face of difficulties." We should establish operation plans with the greatest determination, and guide the masses to actively realize them, so that all cadres and employees regard the completion of the national plan as their sacred duty.

\tII. Formulate advanced and feasible monthly operation instruction charts. Before the start of each month, the monthly operation plan should be formulated based on the national task and in combination with the actual situation. The monthly operation plan of the production unit should be organized and formulated by the production section, and the construction unit should be organized and formulated by the project management section. Before formulation, relevant units should be convened for full discussion and research to prevent subjectivism and formalism.

\tIII. Formulate a daily plan based on the monthly plan to ensure the completion of the monthly plan. To this end, there must be an organization to formulate daily plans to ensure the coordination of various departments, and there must be a person in charge of the daily plan, so that it is possible to ensure the timely and correct formulation and smooth implementation of the daily plan. In order for the daily plan to be feasible, it must be ensured that the daily plan is in line with reality. This should be completed by the person in charge of the daily plan in each department. When the above conditions are fully met, the masses should be organized to discuss the monthly plan on a monthly basis, and the daily plan should be conveyed to the masses through grassroots cadres, so that everyone has a "thorough understanding" of the plan. Finally, we must also strengthen statistical analysis, strengthen original record work, improve and improve the group record-keeping system that has been promoted in many places, strengthen the study of reports, and do a good job in quota management.

\tIV. Establish and improve the dispatching room. The dispatching room is generally set up with a dispatching station, and then a dispatcher. The task of the dispatching room is to comprehensively supervise the work of various departments during the implementation of the plan, ensure the mutual coordination of various departments, and specifically grasp various dispatching businesses.

\tV. Mobilize all employees to actively tap potential, find tricks, and put forward rationalization proposals to strive to complete the national plan.

In order to ensure the complete completion of the above work, it is also necessary to strengthen political work in the enterprise and improve the production technology and political awareness of employees.

    煤矿工业必须加强计划管理
    东北煤矿管理局局长  李建平
    东北煤矿第一季度执行国家计划的情况，说明生产与建设的进度都不均衡，潜力也未发挥。
    在生产方面：周期图表作业大多流产，各月产量先松后紧。如以一、三月份平均，下旬比上旬多完成计划百分之三十二点六，但全月却未完成计划。采煤准备与生产也不平衡，至三月上旬，掘进任务仅完成百分之七十五点二。
    在建设方面：第一季计划只完成百分之三十九，最好的阜新矿也只完成百分之六十一，立井、露天、斜井、总机厂等十六件主要工程，有十二件未完成季计划，有五件尚不及计划的百分之五十。从工程的内部来看，各分部工程间不协调，如海州露天矿至三月末，剥离量已超过移交生产计划的三百万立方公尺，可是保证进一步发展的铁路工程，只完成季计划的百分之十三点三。
    企业的潜力也没有得到充分的发挥。以机械设备的运用情况来看，全面生产机械运用率只达到百分之五十九，四大机械为百分之四十七（台数）；在采煤机械方面，康拜因效能只达到计划的百分之四十五，比一九五二年效率降低百分之四十一；截煤机效能只达到计划的百分之六十六，比去年同期还低百分之七。钻机的运用更差，一、二月份纯钻进时间只占全部作业时间的百分之二十二点五，鹤岗一、二月份纯钻进时间只占全部作业时间的百分之十四。
    以上情况，严重地影响了生产与建设，也增加了事故。第一季十一个局只六个局完成产量计划，建设计划都未完成。钻探计划，一、二月份只完成任务的百分之六十四点七。由于先松后紧，工人疲于突击，疏于安全，机械该检不检，该修不修，以致人身机械事故不断。第一季重大事故三十九次；钻探则整天应付事故。鹤岗一、二月份事故率达百分之五十六，相当于一台钻机一年半又十六天未进行工作；抚顺二月份有三台钻机全月都在处理事故。
    产生以上情况的原因何在呢？有些领导干部强调客观困难，认为大掌子不具备周期作业的条件；材料供应不及时、机电设备故障多、出勤率低等等。以为这些是不可克服的困难。他们不知道这种情况正是没有计划管理或者计划管理不健全的结果。
    目前东北煤矿计划管理的情况是相当混乱的：某些单位的计划，是关在房子里编出来的。对上级是应付差事，讨价还价；对下级是心中无数，盲目折扣。在贯彻执行计划上，对计划就是法律的观念是很模糊的，也没有具体保证计划实现的作业计划。某些干部认为：“计划是计划，工作是工作”，
    一部分工人认为计划是“牛皮文书”，是“豆腐”，很多工友不知道自己的任务。领导方面每季每月将讨论计划当作例行公事，到时候举手通过，至于如何挖潜力，解决关键问题，则很少过问或只限于一般的号召，没有或很少进行执行计划的检查。有的局建设计划科不掌握年度建设计划，向来不检查计划的执行情况，各局的统计科只管汇总数字，不管分析研究。
    因此在讨论国家计划的基础上制订先进的、切实可行的作业计划并监督其执行，加强计划管理，是东北各煤矿当前的一项重要工作。例如海州露天矿的剥离工作，由于制订了较完善的作业计划，掌握了日计划与调度管理，已使工作收到初步成绩，更证实了这一苏联企业管理上的先进经验的优越性。
    东北各煤矿在实行计划管理中，应根据本单位具体情况，注意以下各点：
        一、首先要树立计划观念。在领导方面不允许以官僚主义的态度对待国家计划，并以此教育干部与全体职工，不能“知难而退”，应该以最大的决心建立作业计划，并引导群众积极实现它，以达到全体干部与职工将完成国家计划作为自己神圣的职责。
    二、制订先进的、切实可行的月作业指示图表。每月开始之前，应根据国家任务结合实际情况制定月度作业计划。生产单位的月度作业计划应由生产科负责组织制订，建设单位应由工程管理科负责组织制订。制订前，应召集有关单位充分讨论研究，防止主观主义、形式主义的作法。
    三、根据月计划制订保证完成月计划的日计划。为此，必须有保证各部门协调的制订日计划的组织，要有日计划专责人，这样才可能保证日计划的按时正确制订与顺利实行。要想日计划切实可行，必须保证日计划切合实际。这一点，应该由各部门的日计划负责人来完成。上面的条件已充分具备时，应组织群众按月讨论月计划，并将日计划通过基层干部贯彻到群众中去，使大家对计划“摸底”。最后，还要加强统计分析，加强原始记录工作，健全、提高各地多已推行的小组记录员制，加强表报研究，作好定额管理工作。
    四、建立、健全调度室。调度室一般下设调度站，再下为调度员。调度室的任务是全面督促各部门执行计划期间的工作，保证各部门的相互协调，并具体掌握各种调度业务。
    五、发动全体职工，积极挖潜力，找窍门，提合理化建议，为完成国家计划而奋斗。
    为保证上述工作的彻底完成，还必须加强企业中的政治工作，提高职工的生产技术与政治觉悟。
