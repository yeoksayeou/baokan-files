Key Trial Experiences of Echeng Chengguan Town, Hubei Province, in Implementing the Resolutions of the Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference
The Echeng Working Group of the Urban Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee

I. Class Relations and Existing Problems in Handicraft Industry

After the Hubei Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference, the leaders of Echeng Chengguan Town made general announcements and achieved some results in key industries. They initially reversed the negative thinking of some people who believed that "handicraft industry is useless now that the country has begun economic construction," stabilized the production mood of handicraftsmen, and inspired their enthusiasm for production and operation. The phenomenon of abnormal class relations has also improved. Individual households have begun to increase apprentices, impart skills, and improve operations. However, due to the heavy workload in the town and the dispersed strength of cadres, the implementation of policies was not thorough and comprehensive. Some handicraft capitalists, starting from their personal interests, unilaterally implemented or distorted policies, emphasizing the aspects that were beneficial to themselves. For example, two households, without any operational difficulties, unilaterally emphasized the freedom to dismiss employees because of some incorrect views on workers in the past, and dismissed two workers without any procedures.

Although this deviation was in the minority, it left a bad impression on both handicraftsmen and workers. The workers expressed dissatisfaction, doubted whether their jobs were secure, and wondered whether the policy had changed again. Therefore, it affected their enthusiasm for production and class relations, and also hindered handicraft production.

II. Continuing to Implement the Spirit of the Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference Resolutions

Based on the above situation, we believe that the spirit of the Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference and the "Ten Agreements" need to be further clarified, and practical problems must be solved. On the one hand, we must clarify labor-capital, employment, and apprenticeship relations, and correct the erroneous view of some workers who treat anyone who hires workers or apprentices as capitalists. At the same time, the erroneous practice of individual handicraft capitalists illegally dismissing employees should be educated and stopped, so as to reverse the dissatisfaction and anxiety of the working masses, and then we can improve production.

(1) Convening separate representative conferences: At the handicraft workers' representative conference, the following issues were mainly discussed: (1) Understanding of the "Five-Anti" campaign. (2) Understanding of the policy. (3) What attitude should be taken towards handicraftsmen, etc. The conference was held for four days during non-production time. The first two days were to affirm achievements, encourage enthusiasm, express attitudes, dispel concerns, and expose problems; the last two days were to clarify policies, correct attitudes, find ways to solve problems, and actively unite independent handicraftsmen and handicraft capitalists to improve production. The handicraftsmen's representative conference was also held for four days. At the meeting, the "Ten Agreements" were explained, good examples were commended in light of the policies, and the erroneous behaviors of individual handicraft capitalists and handicraftsmen were criticized. It was explained that such behavior was very wrong and detrimental to production. They were asked to examine how to treat workers in order to improve production, and finally, a summary was made to encourage their enthusiasm. Separate representative conferences were held to facilitate the explanation of policies, and the method was training class style.

(2) Disseminating downwards: After the representatives' thinking was clarified, dissemination was carried out separately, and practical problems were solved in conjunction. At first, the workers' morale was not high, and they did not believe that the problems could be solved. Later, their morale was more "leftist," and they wanted to "struggle to vent their anger." After further discussion and policy study, their understanding gradually improved. Seeing that the handicraftsmen were also holding meetings and learning, and their attitude had become correct, those who had illegally dismissed employees automatically took the workers back after studying the policies (one household reinstated the worker through mediation). The workers' mood stabilized, and the workers themselves also adopted a correct attitude, realizing that the policy had not changed, and that the "Ten Agreements" represented the interests of the workers. The handicraftsmen examined the past in light of the policies and admitted that they had not studied enough and had brought the prejudices from the "Five-Anti" campaign to the present. They said that they had some concerns at first, fearing that the workers would turn around and retaliate against them. Later, seeing that the workers had no intention of revenge after studying, but were even better than before, they were very touched. Some said: "After the Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference, we only knew that we had a future, but we didn't know where the future was. Now the working comrades are asking us to improve relations and improve production, and only then did we really see the future."

(3) Convening a conference to improve production: On the basis of both parties clarifying policies and adopting a correct attitude, it is very necessary to further convene a conference to improve production, so that both parties can meet and communicate, and eliminate prejudices. In addition to explaining the policies at this meeting, it is also necessary to call on everyone to work hard to improve production in the future. We convened four conferences according to industry. Many people spoke at each meeting. They not only examined the past, but also expressed their attitude towards the future. Some connected it to the Korean War and said: "The front is bleeding and sweating, why are we still making trouble and not uniting? Improving production is also a little bit of effort for the Korean War." Some said: "In the past, we sent unity plaques, but we didn't unite well. This time, we have studied the policies well, and solved the problem ideologically. We must implement the improvement of relations and improvement of production into practical actions."

Because the class composition of some handicraftsmen was wrongly determined in the past, we adjusted the class composition in conjunction with this work. Handicraft capitalists accounted for about 2%, among which the most difficult to distinguish were those "ambiguous" households, but the number was not large.

III. Carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Key Industries and Promoting its Experience

For this work, the key industries we selected were the iron industry and the round wood industry.

The problems raised by the workers in the previous stage have generally been resolved, only a few wage adjustment issues have not been resolved. In this stage, we first resolved this issue according to the principle of "proceeding from improving production, and implementing individual adjustments for unreasonable ones," in order to appropriately meet the reasonable demands of the workers, and not harm the enthusiasm of the handicraftsmen for production.

In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, we did the following things:

(1) Solving raw material difficulties. Both the iron and wood industries felt that funds were short, and both received loans from the bank this spring, with a term of three months. The existing raw materials cannot meet the peak season. Although they have cash on hand, they dare not use it, fearing that they will not be able to deliver the bank loans when they are due. We contacted the bank and extended the loan for one month, thus solving the difficulty. They have already purchased a batch of raw materials from Hankou. The wood industry jointly purchased eight liang of wood, and the iron industry separately purchased 1,700 jin of iron materials.

(2) Adjusting prices and profits. The principle is to try to reduce costs and expand sales, and to allow them to have legitimate profits. For example, the gross profit of the iron industry (excluding taxes and all expenses) is around 50%; superior goods should have superior prices, and there is no need to force uniformity. There is no major problem with prices and profits. If the wood industry uses the old price, it will lose money. If it uses the newly negotiated price, it will have a net profit of 15%. However, the technical skills of the wood industry are worse than those of the iron industry. Historically, there has been price-cutting and mutual competition in the off-season, and shoddy products are made in the peak season, so the newly negotiated price has not been implemented. In order to protect the legitimate profits of the handicraft industry and the quality of finished products, we suggested that they negotiate to solve the problem of mutual price-cutting, and implement the more reasonable price agreed upon by everyone from April 20th.

(3) Improving management methods. The iron and wood industries have not had much difficulty in passing through the off-season this year. Generally, it is reflected that the off-season this year is almost the same as the normal months in previous years. For example, the turnover of Gongzhengxing Iron Shop in January, February, and March this year was more than one million yuan. Some households have actively thought of ways to promote finished products. For example, Xiongfusheng Iron Shop sold 470,000 yuan in a promotion in Xishui. Gongzhengxing Iron Shop went to Xishui and Huanggang twice and sold more than 700,000 yuan. This method is very good and should be promoted. Wang Yisheng of the wood industry borrowed money from Wang Xingtai when he had difficulties, and Wang Xingtai sold on consignment when he was short of goods, which was beneficial to both parties. In addition, they have plans for what finished products to manufacture at what time. We just help them check for shortcomings, correct them, and commend and promote the good ones. It is suggested that they pay attention to specifications and quality in the peak season to meet the needs of farmers, and strive to establish credit and establish contact with rural supply and marketing cooperatives through the peak season.

(4) Improving technical quality. Technology is the central issue of the handicraft industry. Not only are specifications and quality determined by technology, but also brand reputation, capital turnover, cost, and profit are closely related to technology. Therefore, in the increase production and practice economy movement in the handicraft industry, the master seriously teaches the apprentice skills well, and the worker and apprentice seriously study and learn the skills well, to improve technology and improve quality, has become the main content.

We believe that in the increase production and practice economy movement in the handicraft industry, if the problems of funds, raw materials, and management methods in the management aspect, and the problems of improving technology, improving quality, and reducing costs in the production aspect are appropriately solved, there will be few or no major problems left. As for "production plans" and "labor contracts," they should be briefly and concisely ordered based on the actual situation and on the basis of clarifying thinking, or both parties can talk face to face. Don't subjectively order dozens of articles. Everyone is illiterate, can't understand them even if they look at them, can't remember them, and has to paste them on the wall and ask others to read them, and in the end, they have to be torn down. The handicraft industry is different from large factories, so it must be realistic, simple, and clear, and cannot commit formalism.

    湖北省鄂城城关镇贯彻省手工业代表会议决议的重点试办经验
    中共湖北省委城市工作部鄂城工作组
    一、手工业中的阶级关系和存在的问题
    湖北省举行手工业代表会议以后，鄂城城关镇领导方面作了一般传达，并在重点行业中作出一些成绩，初步扭转了一些人认为“国家开始进行经济建设，手工业都没有用了”的消极思想，稳定了手工业者的生产情绪，启发了手工业者生产经营的积极性。阶级关系不正常的现象也有了好转，个别户开始增收学徒，传授技术和改善经营。但因镇上工作太多，干部力量分散，因而政策的贯彻不够深入和全面，个别手工业资本家从个人利益出发，片面的执行或歪曲政策，强调对自己有利的一面，如有两户在经营上并没有什么困难，只是因为过去对工人有些不正确看法，现在却片面强调解雇自由，而未经任何手续就把两个工人解雇了。
    这种偏向虽是少数，但也在手工业者中和工人中留下了不好影响，工人表示不满意，怀疑职业是否有保障，是否政策又变了。因此也影响了生产积极性，影响到阶级关系，同样妨碍了手工业生产。
    二、继续贯彻省手工业代表会议决议的精神
    根据以上情况，我们认为对省手工业代表会议精神及“十项协议”，需要进一步交代清楚，实际问题必须解决，一方面要弄清劳资、雇佣、师徒关系，纠正有些工人认为凡是雇佣工人学徒的就当资本家对待的错误看法。同时对个别手工业资本家非法解雇的错误作法，也应予以教育和制止，使工人群众的不满和不安情绪扭转过来，然后才能把生产搞好。
    （一）分别召开代表会议：在手工业工人代表会议上着重讨论了以下几个问题：（1）对“五反”的认识。（2）对政策的认识。（3）对手工业者应抱何种态度等。会议利用非生产时间开了四天，前两天是肯定成绩，鼓励情绪，表明态度，打消顾虑，暴露问题；后两天是明确政策，端正态度，设法解决问题，主动团结手工业独立劳动者和手工业资本家，搞好生产。手工业者代表会议也开了四天，会上讲解了“十项协议”，结合政策表扬了好的典型，批判了个别手工业资本家和手工业者的错误行为。说明这种行为是很不对的，是不利于生产的，让他们检查如何对待工人才能搞好生产，最后再加以总结，鼓励其情绪。代表会分别召开是为了便于交代政策，方式是训练班方式。
    （二）向下传达：代表思想明确之后，分别进行传达，并结合解决实际问题。工人方面起初情绪不高，不相信能解决问题，后来情绪较“左”，要“斗争个把出出气”，经过进一步讨论和学习政策，认识逐步提高了；又见手工业者也在开会、学习以后态度端正了，非法解雇的，经过学习政策自动把工人收回来了（一户是调解复工），工人的情绪安定了，工人本身的态度也端正了，认识到政策并没有变，“十项协议”是代表工人利益的。手工业者结合政策检查了过去，承认学习不够，把“五反”中的成见带到了现在；他们说，他们起初有些顾虑，怕工人反转来搞他们，后来见工人学习之后并无报复之心，反而比以前更好了，很受感动，有的说：“省手工业代表会议以后，我们只知道自己有了前途，但不知前途在那里，现在工作同志叫我们搞好关系，搞好生产，这才真的看见了前途。”
    （三）召开搞好生产大会：在双方明确政策、态度端正的基础上，进一步召开搞好生产大会，使双方见面通气，消除成见是很必要的。在这个会上除了要讲明政策外，还要号召大家今后要努力搞好生产。我们按行业召开了四个大会，每个会上都有许多人讲话，他们不但检查了过去，还表示了今后的态度，有的联系到抗美援朝说：“前方流血流汗，我们还闹什么不团结，搞好生产也算为抗美援朝尽了一点力量。”有的说：“过去送过团结匾，也没有团结好，这次政策学习好了，从思想上解决了问题，要把搞好关系搞好生产贯彻到实际行动中去。”
    因为过去把某些手工业者成份弄错了，我们在这一段工作中，结合调整了一下阶级成份，手工业资本家约占百分之二，其中不好分清的主要是那些“两可”户，但数目不大。
    三、在重点行业中开展增产节约运动，并推广其经验
    进行这一工作，我们所选择的重点行业是铁业和圆木业。
    前一段工人所提出的问题一般是解决了，只有个别工资调整问题没有解决。这一段我们首先根据“从搞好生产出发，不合理者实行个别调整”的原则，解决了这个问题，以适当满足工人的合理要求，并且不伤害手工业者的生产积极性。
    在增产节约运动中，我们作了如下几件事情：
    （一）解决原料困难。铁、木两业都感资金短少，今春在银行都得到贷款，期限三个月。现存原料接不上旺季，手下虽有现款，不敢动用，怕到期不能交付银行贷款。我们和银行接洽，将贷款延期一个月，这样困难就解决了。他们已经到汉口购回了一批原料，木业联合购回木料八两码子，铁业分别购回铁料一千七百斤。
    （二）调整价格利润。原则是既要设法降低成本扩大销路，又使他们有合法利润可图。如铁业毛利
    （未包括税收及一切开支）都在百分之五十上下；优货优价，不必强求统一，价格利润上无大问题。木业若按旧价就要亏本，若按新议价格就有百分之十五的纯利。但木业技术性比铁业较差，历来淡月有彼此杀价互相竞争的情况，旺月就粗制滥造，以致新议价格未能执行。为了保障手工业的合法利润及成品质量，我们建议他们协商解决互相杀价问题，从四月二十日起，执行大家协议的较合理的价格。
    （三）改善经营方法。铁、木两业今年在度过淡月中困难不大，一般反映今年淡月已和往年平月差不多。如龚正兴铁店今年元、二、三月份营业额都在百万元以上，有些户在推销成品上主动想了些办法，如熊复盛铁店到浠水推销一次就卖了四十七万元，龚正兴铁店到浠水、黄冈去了两次卖了七十多万元，这种办法很好，应该推广；木业王义盛有困难时向王兴太借钱，缺货时就给王兴太代销，双方有利。此外什么时候制造什么成品，他们都有计划，我们只是帮助他们检查一下，缺点加以改正，好的就表扬推广。建议他们在迎接旺月中要注意规格品质，适合农民需要，争取通过旺月树立信用和农村供销合作社建立联系。
    （四）提高技术质量，技术是手工业的中心问题。不但规格品质决定于技术，招牌信用、资金周转、成本利润等都和技术有很大关系。因此在手工业中开展增产节约运动，师傅认真教好学徒技术，工人学徒认真钻研学好技术，来提高技术，提高质量，就成了主要内容。
    我们认为在手工业中开展增产节约运动，如果把经营方面的资金原料、经营方法等和生产方面的提高技术提高质量降低成本等问题适当解决，剩下的问题就不多了或不大了。至于“生产计划”“劳动合同”等，应根据实际情况在搞通思想的基础上，简单扼要的订一下，或双方对面说一说就可以。不要主观的订几十条，大家不识字，看也看不懂，记也记不住，贴在墙上找别人念，结果还要撕下来。手工业不同于大工厂，所以要切合实际，简单明了，不能犯形式主义的毛病。
