How a Low-Level Mutual Aid Team Was Consolidated and Improved
    Wang Engui

    The Han Kui Mutual Aid Team in Liánhé Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, was originally a temporary team for exchanging labor when plowing. This year, when preparing for spring plowing, with the help of district cadres, it was reorganized into a three-season mutual aid team with seven households participating, and team members elected Han Kui as the team leader. Initially, Han Kui lacked confidence, saying, "I have no education, no experience, and no calculating skills. I can't even manage my own production well, how can I lead others?" Later, Comrade Wang, who was sent to the countryside by the county, gave him some guidance and encouraged him to learn from the perennial mutual aid team led by Gao Daichang in the village. Only then did his confidence increase. He firmly grasped the method of "learning from others, improving oneself" to lead the mutual aid team.

    When the ground had just thawed, the Gao Daichang Mutual Aid Team launched a manure accumulation campaign. Han Kui quickly went to Gao Daichang to learn about the methods of accumulating, transporting, and allocating labor. Then, he convened a meeting with the team members to discuss the issue of exchanging labor to accumulate manure. The seven team members divided the work and cooperated, some digging, some loading, and some transporting. After accumulating enough for one household, they moved on to the next. In just over ten days, the entire team accumulated more than 120 cartloads of manure, which, together with the original pig manure and human manure, totaled more than 300 cartloads. Before sowing, the Gao Daichang Mutual Aid Team created a double-row soybean grid press (a tool for stepping on grids) and a double-tube gourd planter, planting all four hectares and eight mu of high-yield land with double-seed soybeans. Other crops were also planted with equal spacing and wide rows, and continuous operations were implemented. Seeing this, the Han Kui Mutual Aid Team also appropriately improved their farming methods according to the production conditions of their own team. As a result, the seedlings emerged evenly and grew vigorously.

    After the spring plowing, with the help of Gao Daichang, Han Kui and the active members of the team summarized the spring plowing and sowing work. In the summary, they found that after changing from a plowing exchange team to a seasonal team, especially after having a team leader and learning the methods of the perennial team, there were many differences compared to previous years: the enthusiasm for work was greater, more manure was accumulated, deep plowing and fine cultivation were implemented during sowing, and spring drought was overcome. However, there were still many shortcomings that needed to be improved: First, in mutual aid production, labor was not divided according to strength, work was not divided according to quality, and skills were not divided according to level. They always recorded one work point for each day of work, which meant that some people suffered losses and some people benefited. Second, there was no work point record and settlement system. The team members relied on their own memory for the labor of people and animals owed to each other, and it was almost impossible to settle accounts during the sowing stage. Third, business management was not democratic enough. For example, when arranging shifts for work, the team leader sometimes did not consult everyone's opinions, which caused dissatisfaction among some team members. Everyone felt that if these problems were not resolved in time, it would reduce the team members' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, they formulated practical and feasible solutions: First, implement democratic management. When hoeing, the order of work should be based on the cleanliness of the land. The team leader should first formulate a plan, which should be discussed and decided by the team members. Second, implement a mutually beneficial policy. Each person's fixed score should be assessed based on their labor strength, skill level, and work quality. If the individual has displayed initiative and improved work efficiency, points should be increased according to the situation. Third, establish a work point settlement system. Each person should be issued one hundred work point tickets. After finishing work, they should exchange work point tickets every night, record and settle accounts every five days, and collect all tickets in one season. After repeated discussions, revisions, and supplements by the team members, the above methods were implemented.

    On June 9th, the Han Kui Mutual Aid Team began summer hoeing. In order to strengthen the quality of the work, they used the good methods of the Gao Daichang team, resulting in fine hoeing that did not damage the seedlings or leave weeds. In order to thin the seedlings well, they organized three women from their team to work for three days in the Gao Daichang team, learning how to thin seedlings. Due to the implementation of the mutually beneficial policy, democratic management, and the work point settlement system, the Han Kui Mutual Aid Team, from spring planting to summer hoeing, has been working together continuously, and has transformed from a temporary exchange team into a three-season mutual aid team.

    The practice of the Han Kui Mutual Aid Team over the past six months proves that doing a good job with perennial teams, establishing a banner, and strengthening the connection between perennial teams and low-level teams is a good way to improve low-level teams and lead mutual aid and cooperation.

    一个低级互助组是怎样巩固和提高的
    王恩贵
    吉林省蛟河县联合屯韩奎互助组原来是一个临时插犋换工组，今年开始准备春耕的时候，由区干部帮助改组成一个有七户人参加的三大季的互助组，并由组员选出韩奎当组长。最初韩奎没有信心，他说：“我一没有文化，二没有经验，又没有算计，连自己的生产还搞不好，怎能领导别人。”后来由县里下乡的王同志给他指点了一些办法，并让他向本屯常年互助组组长高岱长领导的互助组学习，他的信心才提高了。他紧紧抓住了“学习别人，提高自己”的方法来领导互助组。
    地刚解冻的时候，高岱长互助组掀起了积肥运动。韩奎就赶紧到高岱长那里学习攒粪、送粪和支配劳动力的办法。接着又找组员们开会商量换工攒粪的问题。七个组员，分工合作，挖的挖，装的装，送的送，给这家攒够了，再给另一家攒，十几天的工夫，全组一共攒出了一百二十多车粪，加上原来的猪圈粪、人粪等共送出三百多车。播种前，高岱长互助组创造出大豆双行压格器（即踩格子的工具）和双筒点胡芦，把四垧八亩丰产地的大豆都播成双苗眼，其他庄稼也实行了等距宽播和连结作业。韩奎互助组看到了，就按着自己组的生产条件，也适当地改进了耕作法，因而小苗出得齐，长得旺。
    春耕结束后，在高岱长的帮助下，韩奎和组内的积极分子，在一块总结了春耕播种工作。在总结中，发现由插犋换工组变成季节组，特别是有了组长，学习了常年组的办法以后，和往年有很多不同：干活劲头大了，多攒了粪肥，播种时实行了深耕细作和连结作业，克服了春旱。但是也还存在许多应该改进的缺点：一、在互助生产中，劳力不分强弱，干活不分好坏，技术不分高低，总是干一天活就订一个工，有的人吃亏，有的人占便宜。二、没有记工清账，组员们互相存欠的人畜工，全靠自己心里记，在播种阶段，险些儿算不清账。三、经营管理还不够民主。像轮班干活时，组长有时没有征求大家的意见，因而有的组员不满意。大家都认为这些问题如果不及时解决，便会减低组员们的生产积极性。于是订出了切实可行的解决办法：一、实行民主管理，铲地时干活先后问题，应根据地的荒净情况，先由组长订出计划，经过组员讨论决定。二、贯彻互利政策，按每人劳力强弱、技术高低、干活好坏评出每个人的固定分数，如果本人发挥了积极性，提高了工作效率，就按情况增分。三、建立清工结账制度。每人发给一百张工票，干完活后，每天晚上找换工票，五天记账清账一次，一季找齐。以上办法经过组员反复讨论修改和补充后，就照着实行了。
    六月九日，韩奎互助组开始了夏锄，为了加强工作的质量，他们运用了高岱长组铲地的好办法，结果铲的细，又不伤苗、不留草。为了间好苗，他们组织了本组的三名妇女到高岱长组作了三天工，学会了怎样间苗。由于贯彻了互利政策，实行了民主管理和清工结账制度，韩奎互助组从打春起种地到夏锄，一直是在一块干活，已由一个临时换工组变成三大季的互助组。
    韩奎互助组半年来的实践证明，搞好常年组，树立旗帜，并加强常年组和低级组的联系，是提高低级组，领导互助合作的好办法。
