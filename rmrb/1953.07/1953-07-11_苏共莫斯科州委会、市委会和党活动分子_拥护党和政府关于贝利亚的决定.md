    Moscow Regional Committee and City Committee of the CPSU and Party Activists
    Endorse the Party and Government's Decision on Beria
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 10th] According to TASS, Moscow, July 10th: The Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, together with party activists from Moscow City and the Moscow Region, held a joint plenary meeting on the 9th in the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions to discuss the summary of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Nearly two thousand people attended the meeting.
    The meeting listened with great attention to the report by Mikhailov, Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes, which he read out.
    The meeting expressed the unified will of all Moscow Party organizations and welcomed the decision of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee with unanimous and prolonged applause, expressing full support for the timely and resolute measures taken by the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee to liquidate Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes, considering this measure to be the only correct one.
    The meeting, with stormy applause, unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed the decision of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee to expel Beria from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to submit Beria's criminal case to the Supreme Court of the USSR for trial.
    The joint plenary meeting powerfully demonstrated the unity and close solidarity of the Moscow Party organization around the CPSU Central Committee. The rapporteur and all those who spoke in the discussion said that the decision of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee was of great significance to the Party and to all the Soviet people. All those present believed that this decision would be fully supported and endorsed by all Party organizations. The meeting unanimously pointed out that in the four months since the death of J.V. Stalin, the Party Central Committee has ensured continuous and correct leadership of all aspects of our country's life; great work has been done in uniting the Party and the people around the task of building communism, in strengthening the economic and defense power of the motherland, and in further improving the lives of workers, collective farmers, intellectuals—all the Soviet people. The Party is implementing the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, ensuring a great upsurge in all sectors of the national economy. The Soviet government is steadfastly pursuing a policy of peace, thereby further consolidating the Soviet Union's international position, enhancing the Soviet Union's prestige, and greatly boosting the worldwide movement to defend and consolidate peace. The Party Central Committee pays particular attention to ensuring the unity of leadership of the Party and the government in order to successfully solve the fundamental tasks of building a communist society. Speakers at the meeting expressed indignation and anger when talking about the insidious activities of Beria, the despicable enemy of the Party and the Soviet people, and the agent of international imperialism.
    Guryayev, Secretary of the Lenin District Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow, said: "The despicable activities of the bourgeois degenerate Beria have aroused the indignation and anger of the entire Party and the entire Soviet people. Everyone supports with great satisfaction the timely and resolute measures taken by our Party Central Committee to eliminate Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes."
    Kopinkin, Secretary of the Naro-Fominsk City Party Committee, pointed out in his speech the profound significance and great role of the decision of the Party Central Committee. He also criticized shortcomings in ideological work and said: We must extensively展開批评和自我批评criticize and self-criticize, and show greater vigilance in our work.
    Severyanov, director of the Three Hills Textile Factory, said: "Our Party teaches us that we must adhere to principles, maintain political sensitivity, and always remember the capitalist encirclement and maintain vigilance at all times and everywhere. We should draw political lessons from the Beria incident. This traitor and traitor has embarked on the path of monstrous crimes, attempting to obstruct our country's cause of communist construction. We are deeply grateful to our Party Central Committee for exposing this traitor so that he cannot do harm."
    Azheirkov, chairman of the "Fighter" Collective Farm, said that no enemy can destroy the Soviet collective farm system. The collective farmers, educated by Communist Party, will support the measures taken against Beria, the enemy of the working people.
    Representatives from mass organizations of the working people—Vasiliev, Chairman of the Moscow Regional Trade Union Committee, and Khaldyeev, Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Youth League—expressed the opinions of millions of trade union members, Communist Youth League members, and young people. They spoke with indignation about Beria's vile hostile activities. They declared that all the working people are united around the Communist Party and are ready to dedicate all their strength to the victorious construction of communism.
    Academician Topchiev, Professor Vovchenko, writer Simonov, and others who participated in the meeting spoke on behalf of the Soviet intellectuals. They spoke about the achievements of the Soviet state in science and culture under the leadership of the Communist Party. Academician Topchiev said that Soviet scientists and cultural workers will certainly denounce the anti-Party and anti-state crimes of Beria, the enemy of the people, and assure the Party and the Soviet people that they will contribute all their strength and knowledge to the victorious realization of the historical tasks set by the 19th Party Congress.
    The Communists of Moscow City and Moscow Region responded to the call of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—to draw political lessons from the Beria incident, draw the necessary conclusions, and guide their future activities—by exposing and criticizing the shortcomings of Party and Soviet organizations in economic construction and communist education. The meeting cited specific examples to illustrate that there are still some backward industrial enterprises in Moscow City and Moscow Region, and that some collective farms are still being neglected. Participants also put forward many concrete suggestions for overcoming these shortcomings.
    The meeting paid close attention to the tasks of Party organizations in improving Party organizational and ideological work. The meeting pointed out that the Moscow Party organization has serious shortcomings in adhering to the Leninist principles of Party Bolshevik leadership. Some Party district committees and city committees violated the time limit for convening plenary meetings stipulated in the Party Constitution, violated the principle of collective leadership, and failed to ensure the necessary criticism and self-criticism. The meeting also pointed out great shortcomings in Party propaganda work. In Party propaganda work, in recent years, the Moscow Party organization has deviated from the Marxist-Leninist understanding of the role of the individual in history. Party propaganda has not correctly clarified the role of the Communist Party as the leading force in our country's communist construction, but has often been confused by the personality cult, which has led to the underestimation of the role of the Party and its leading core, and reduced the creative enthusiasm of Party members and the broad masses of working people. In some cases, dogmatism and blind obedience have replaced the creative mastery of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Due attention has not been paid to the ideological training of Party, Soviet, and economic cadres, and to educating them in the spirit of strict observance of Party and state discipline. The meeting also pointed out that Party organizations at all levels have not paid enough attention to propagating the ideas of Soviet patriotism and the friendship of the Soviet nationalities, and to educating the working people in the spirit of political vigilance, socialist labor attitude, and socialist ownership.
    The joint plenary meeting of the Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU, in its completely unanimous decision, fully supported the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and took it as an unwavering guide for its implementation. The decision formulated specific measures for the Moscow City and Moscow Region Party organizations to implement the tasks stipulated by the plenary session of the Party Central Committee. The decision said: "The joint plenary meeting of the Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, together the activists, assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the Moscow Party organization shall continue to be a loyal and reliable pillar of the Party Central Committee. The Moscow Party organization will unite its ranks more closely around the CPSU Central Committee, and under its tested leadership, will lead the working people of Moscow City and Moscow Region in the struggle to implement the policies planned by the Party and realize the magnificent plan of our country's communist construction."

    苏共莫斯科州委会、市委会和党活动分子
    拥护党和政府关于贝利亚的决定
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会、莫斯科市委员会，会同莫斯科市和莫斯科州党活动分子，于九日在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行联合全体会议，讨论苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的总结。出席会议的将近二千人。
    会议极其注意地听取了苏联共产党莫斯科委员会书记米哈伊洛夫的报告，和他宣读的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于贝利亚的反党和反国家的罪行的决定。
    会议表示出一切莫斯科党组织的统一的意志，以一致的长时间的鼓掌欢迎苏共中央全体会议的决定，表示完全拥护苏共中央主席团为清算贝利亚的反党和反国家的罪行所采取的及时而坚决的措施，认为这个措施是唯一正确的。
    会议以暴风雨般的鼓掌，完全一致和热烈地拥护苏共中央全体会议关于将贝利亚开除出苏联共产党的决定，并一致热烈地拥护苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于将贝利亚的罪行案件提交苏联最高法院审理的决议。
    联合全体会议有力地显示出莫斯科党组织的团结一致和紧密团结在苏共中央的周围。报告人和所有在讨论中发言的人都说，苏共中央全体会议的决定，对党、对全体苏联人民，都具有重大的意义。全体到会者认为，这个决定一定会受到所有党组织的完全支持和拥护。会议一致指出，自从约·维·斯大林逝世后的四个月以来，党中央委员会保证了对于我国全部生活的不间断的和正确的领导；在把党和人民团结在建设共产主义任务的周围方面，在加强祖国的经济和国防力量方面，在进一步改善工人、集体农民、知识分子—全体苏联人民的生活方面，已做了巨大的工作。党正在实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议，保证了国民经济各部门的巨大的高涨。苏联政府坚持不渝地执行和平政策，从而使得苏联的国际地位进一步巩固，使得苏联的威信提高，使得全世界保卫和巩固和平的运动大大高涨。党中央委员会特别关心保证对党和政府的领导的统一，以便顺利解决建设共产主义社会的根本任务。会上发言的人在谈到党和苏联人民的卑鄙的敌人、国际帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的阴险活动时，表示了愤慨和愤怒。
    苏联共产党莫斯科列宁区委员会书记顾里亚耶夫说：“资产阶级蜕化分子贝利亚的卑鄙活动，引起了全党、全体苏联人民的愤慨和愤怒。大家以十分满意的心情，拥护我们党中央委员会为肃清贝利亚的反党和反国家的罪行所采取的及时而坚决的措施。”
    纳罗—福明斯克市党委会书记科平金，在发言中指出党中央全体会议的决定的深刻意义和重大作用。他还批评了思想工作上的缺点，并且说：必须广泛地展开批评和自我批评，在工作中要表现更高的警惕。
    三山纺织厂厂长谢维里雅诺夫说：“我们的党教导我们，无论何时何地都要遵守原则，保持政治敏感性，始终记住资本主义的包围并保持警惕。我们应该从贝利亚事件中吸取政治教训。这一叛徒和卖国贼已走上了滔天罪恶的道路，企图阻挠我国共产主义建设事业。我们深深感谢我们党中央揭发了这一卖国贼，使他不能为害。”
    “战士”集体农庄主席阿热伊尔科夫说，没有任何敌人能够破坏苏联的集体农庄制度。在共产党教育下的集体农民，将拥护对劳动人民的敌人贝利亚所采取的措施。
    劳动人民群众组织的代表——莫斯科州工会委员会主席瓦西里耶夫和青年团莫斯科州委员会书记哈尔杰耶夫，表示了千百万工会会员、青年团员和青年的意见。他们愤慨地谈到了贝利亚的卑劣的敌对活动。他们宣称，全体劳动人民团结在共产党的周围，准备把全部力量献给胜利的共产主义建设。
    参加会议的科学院院士托普切夫、教授伏夫钦科、作家西蒙诺夫等人，代表苏联的知识分子讲话。他们谈到了苏维埃国家在共产党的领导下，在科学和文化方面所获得的成绩。托普切夫院士说，苏联的科学家和文化工作者一定会痛斥人民的敌人贝利亚的反党和反国家的罪行，并向党和苏联人民保证：他们要为胜利地实现第十九次党代表大会所规定的历史任务，贡献出自己的全部力量和知识。
    莫斯科市和莫斯科州的共产党员们响应苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的号召——从贝利亚事件中吸取政治教训，做出必要的结论，来指导自己今后的活动——揭发和批评了党和苏维埃组织在经济建设和共产主义教育方面的缺点。会议上举出了一些具体的事例，说明莫斯科市和莫斯科州还有一些落后的工业企业，说明有些集体农庄还有被忽视的情况。与会者并提出了许多克服这些缺点的具体建议。
    会议很注意党组织在改善党的组织工作和思想工作方面的任务。会议指出，莫斯科党组织在遵守列宁制订的党的布尔什维克领导原则方面，有着严重的缺点。有些党的区委会和市委会违犯党章所规定的召开全体会议的期限，违犯集体领导的原则，没有保证展开应有的批评和自我批评。会议还指出了在党的宣传工作方面的巨大缺点。在党的宣传工作方面，最近几年来，莫斯科的党组织对个人在历史上的作用的问题，离开了马克思列宁主义的理解。党的宣传没有正确地阐明共产党作为我国共产主义建设的领导力量的作用，而往往迷惑于个人崇拜，这就使得党和它的领导核心的作用被轻视，使得党员群众和广大劳动群众的创造积极性降低。在某些场合下，教条主义和盲从主义代替了对于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说的创造性的掌握。对党的、苏维埃的、经济的干部的思想锻炼，和以严格遵守党和国家纪律的精神教育他们的工作，没有给予应有的注意。会议又指出，各级党组织在宣传苏维埃爱国主义、苏联各民族友谊这些思想上，在以政治警惕性、社会主义劳动态度和社会主义所有制的精神教育劳动人民上，也注意得不够。
    苏共莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会的联合全体会议，在它的完全团结一致地通过的决定中，完全拥护苏联共产党中央委员会的决定，并把它作为坚定不移的指针来加以执行。决定中拟定了莫斯科市和莫斯科州党组织关于实现党中央全体会议规定的任务的具体措施。决定中说：“苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会，会同活动分子举行的联合全体会议，向苏联共产党中央委员会保证：莫斯科党组织将继续作党中央委员会的忠诚可靠的支柱。莫斯科党组织将把自己的队伍更紧密地团结在苏共中央的周围，并将在它的经过考验的领导下，领导莫斯科市和莫斯科州的劳动人民进行斗争，实现党所规划的政策，实现我国共产主义建设的宏伟计划。”
