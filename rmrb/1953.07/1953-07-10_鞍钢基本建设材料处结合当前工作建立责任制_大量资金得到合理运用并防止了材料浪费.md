The Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in the movement to establish a responsibility system, has focused on the two central tasks of ensuring material supply and implementing economic accounting. It has vigorously revised material supply plans, inventoried warehouses, and organized material recycling. This has not only ensured the rational use of more than 400 billion yuan of national funds but has also created favorable conditions for the timely supply of materials in the future.

The material supply plan for the Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company this year was initially drafted as early as the fourth quarter of last year. However, the plans were mostly based on estimations and did not correspond to actual needs. In particular, with changes in the construction projects for 1953, the original plan became even more difficult to align with reality. Therefore, in the movement to establish a responsibility system, the Basic Construction Materials Department, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, organized more than 60 cadres and spent 24 days revising the supply plan carefully, adhering to the principle of "opposing both conservatism and preventing recklessness." As a result, the demand was greatly reduced. For example, the original plan for pig iron for casting was 4,022 tons, but after the revision, only 1,561 tons were needed. The original plan for round steel was 10,703 tons, but after the revision, including reserves, only 4,455 tons were needed. From a general perspective, steel materials were reduced by an average of 42 percent, electrical equipment by 27 percent, timber by 37 percent, and cement by 30 percent. As a result, a total of more than 289 billion yuan of national funds could be saved. During the revision of the plan, the department also discovered many materials that were omitted or miscopied in the past plans and made timely additions and corrections.

Simultaneously with the revision of the plan, the Basic Construction Materials Department also conducted a thorough inventory of the warehouse. It discovered I-beams, channel steel, and seamless steel pipes worth more than 159 billion yuan that were not needed by the unit but were urgently needed by other basic construction departments. At the same time, a large number of off-the-books and deposited materials were cleared out. In addition, many materials were found to have deteriorated or could only be downgraded due to poor storage. Afterwards, for those stockpiled materials, the Basic Construction Materials Department established a special organization to promote sales to the outside world in a timely manner (currently, the materials sold by itself have reached 32 billion yuan, and those allocated by the Ministry of Heavy Industry have reached 65 billion yuan), and appropriate measures have also been taken for those off-the-books and poorly stored materials. In this way, the accumulation of national funds was reduced, and warehouse management was improved, preventing the waste of materials.

The good results of the Basic Construction Materials Department's reduction of supply plans and disposal of stockpiled materials have been clearly reflected in the reduction of special funds. In the past, the entire department needed 100 billion to 200 billion yuan of special funds per month to operate, but in June, only 80 billion yuan was needed.

In revising the plan and inventorying the warehouse, the Basic Construction Materials Department discovered that there was a shortage of more than 30 kinds of so-called "difficult" materials that were not easy to obtain and were urgently needed for the project. In order to purchase them quickly, the entire department transferred more than ten cadres, according to the principle of dedicated personnel in charge, to find sources and sign contracts in various places. Now, eight kinds of materials have been shipped to the warehouse, and ten kinds of materials have been fully or partially ordered. In addition, sources have been found for eight kinds.

Because the basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel is mostly reconstruction projects, a large number of waste channel steel, angle steel, plate steel, I-beams, and other materials are scattered around many construction sites. The Basic Construction Materials Department has now established a special organization to recover more than 6,000 tons of various waste materials. The 600 tons of cast iron floor that was recovered from the thin plate rolling mill construction site alone, which can be used for large-scale construction sites, is worth more than 12 billion yuan.

Through this movement to establish a responsibility system, especially through the work of revising plans, inventorying warehouses, and recovering materials, the staff of the Materials Department has been greatly educated. Everyone unanimously realized that their work is an important task, and a slight negligence or irresponsibility would bring huge losses to the country. Therefore, it was proposed that in the future, "do not order goods without checking the basis, and do not purchase without knowing the source." Now, they have turned slogans into practical actions. For example, the Geological Department requested 200 kilograms of hard alloy, and Li Shikui of the Mechanical and Electrical Section, after understanding, only 28 kilograms were enough, so only 28 kilograms were allocated in the end. The thin plate rolling mill construction site proposed to use 520,000 steel bricks, and after an actual investigation by five comrades from the mine kiln team, it was found that the construction site not only did not need more than 500,000 steel bricks, but also had more than 120,000 in their warehouse. So, the supply plan was set at 270,000.

    鞍钢基本建设材料处结合当前工作建立责任制
    大量资金得到合理运用并防止了材料浪费
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设材料处在建立责任制运动中，抓住材料部门的保证供应与贯彻经济核算两个中心课题，大力修订材料供应计划，清点仓库和组织材料回收，不但使国家四千余亿元的资金得到合理运用，而且给今后准时地供应材料创造了良好的条件。
    鞍钢基本建设材料处今年的材料供应计划，早在去年第四季度就已经初步订出。但计划大都是由估计而来的，和实际需要极不相符，特别是一九五三年工程项目已有变动，原订计划就更难切合实际。因此，基本建设材料处在建立责任制运动中，根据重工业部的指示，组织了六十余名干部，利用二十四天的时间，以“既反对保守，又防止冒进”为原则，将供应计划作了一次慎重的修改。结果，大大地削减了需要量。如铸造生铁原计划要四千零二十二吨，修改后只需一千五百六十一吨。圆钢原计划要一万零七百零三吨，修改后加上储备量才四千四百五十五吨。从总的方面看，钢铁类材料平均削减了百分之四十二，电气器材削减百分之二十七，木材削减百分之三十七，水泥削减百分之三十。由此，总计约可少用国家资金两千八百九十余亿元。在修订计划中，该处还发现了许多过去计划中遗漏和误抄的材料，并及时作了追加和修正。
    与修订计划同时，基本建设材料处还彻底地清查了一次仓库。发现了价值一千五百九十余亿元的本单位用不着而其他基本建设部门迫切需要的工字钢、槽钢以及无缝钢管等材料，同时清理出大批账外和寄存性的材料。此外，还发现许多由于保管不良而变质转废或只得降级使用的材料。事后，对那些积压的材料，基本建设材料处成立了专门机构及时向外推销（现由自己推销出的材料已达三百二十亿元，由重工业部调剂出的达六百五十亿元），对那些账外和保管不良的材料也作了适当处理。这样，既减免了国家资金的积压，又改善了仓库管理工作，防止了材料的浪费。
    基本建设材料处削减供应计划与处理积压材料的良好结果，已显明地见诸于专用资金的减少上。过去全处每月需要一千亿元到两千亿元的专用资金才能周转，六月份只要八百亿元就行了。
    在修订计划和清查仓库中，基本建设材料处曾发现缺乏三十余种来源不易、工程要得紧的所谓“困难”材料。为了迅速采购，全处抽调了十多名干部，根据专人专责的原则，分头至各地找来源、订合同，现在已有八种材料运抵仓库，十种材料已全部订货或部分订货。另外，有八种找到了货源。
    由于鞍钢的基本建设大部是改建工程，许多工地散乱着大批的废旧槽钢、角钢、板钢、工字钢等材料。基本建设材料处这次成立了专门机构，回收各种废旧材料六千余吨。仅在薄板轧制厂工地收回来的、可供大型工地使用的六百吨铸铁地板，价值就在十二亿元以上。
    经过这次建立责任制运动，特别是经过修订计划、清点仓库和回收材料的工作，大大地教育了材料处的工作人员。大家一致认识到，自己的工作是一项重要工作，稍一疏忽或不负责任，就将给国家带来巨大的损失。因而提出：今后“不查明根据不订货，没根没底不采购”。现在，他们已把口号变成了实际行动。如地质处请拨二百公斤硬质合金，机电科李世奎去一了解，只二十八公斤就够用，最后就只拨给二十八公斤。薄板轧制厂工地提出要用五十二万块钢砖，矿窑组五个同志经过实际调查，发现该工地不但不需要五十多万块钢砖，而且他们库里还存有十二万多块。于是就把供应计划订为二十七万块。
