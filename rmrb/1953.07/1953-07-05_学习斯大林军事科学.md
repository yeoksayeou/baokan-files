    Studying Stalin's Military Science
    Zhong Yangzhi
    After achieving nationwide victory, the Chinese people have never relaxed in consolidating their armed forces and national defense during the period of restoring the national economy. Now, with the planned economic construction of our country already underway, in order to safeguard the security of our motherland, to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to be prepared to crush imperialist aggression at any time, we are required to further consolidate and develop our armed forces and national defense. Therefore, accelerating the regularization and modernization of our People's Army has become one of the major tasks of our people during the period of large-scale economic construction. The central link in accomplishing this task is to conscientiously study Stalin's military science, diligently learn from the advanced military experiences and advanced military technology of the Soviet Union, and build the Chinese army in the style of the Soviet army. Chairman Mao instructed us at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We are going to carry out great national construction. The work before us is arduous and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." "We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a nationwide upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union to build our country." This brilliant instruction is of decisive significance for our national defense construction and military construction, just as it is for our economic construction and cultural construction. This instruction teaches the Chinese People's Armed Forces that they must conscientiously study Stalin's military science, and launch a nationwide upsurge in the whole army to learn from the Soviet army, so as to build our army into one of the best and most modern armies in the world.
    Stalin's military science is a new stage in the development of Marxist-Leninist military theory. It is based on materialism, accepts the achievements of all historical military theories, and solves all the complex problems of strategy and tactics in modern warfare. Therefore, it is the highest peak of modern military thought, the most advanced military science in the world, and the key to victory in modern warfare. It possesses incomparable superiority over bourgeois military theories. Comrade Bulganin said: "The ultimate result of any army's war against a powerful enemy is the sole real measure of its power, its combat qualities, and the military science that forms the basis of its organization and combat operations." ("Basic Theory of Marxism-Leninism on War," Dalian Xinhua Bookstore, 1950 edition, p. 150) The fact that the Soviet army defeated the fascist German army that roamed across the European continent and annihilated the elite of Japanese fascism—the Kwantung Army—in World War II is a clear proof of the unparalleled superiority of Stalin's military science.
    One of the most important principles of Stalin's military science, as Comrade Stalin pointed out in his order to the Red Army on February 23, 1942, is: "Now the fate of war will not be determined by the accidental factor of surprise, but by those constantly occurring factors: the solidity of the rear, the fighting spirit of the army, the number and quality of divisions, the armament of the army, the organizational ability of the army commanders, etc." This principle tells us that the victory or defeat of war is not only closely related to military construction, but also closely related to the economic and political system, not only closely related to the morale of the army, but also closely related to the political consciousness of the people, not only closely related to the maturity of army cadres, but also closely related to the maturity of national talents.
    The above-mentioned principles of Stalin's military science have extremely realistic guiding significance for our national defense construction. In our national defense construction, we should estimate those factors that constantly affect the war, and fully develop and correctly utilize these factors.
    To achieve the consolidation of the rear and obtain sufficient modern equipment, it is necessary to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship and strengthen economic and cultural construction, and the central link is the industrialization of the country, especially the development of heavy industry and defense industry. Chairman Mao taught us, "Without industry, there is no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. 3, p. 1104) To realize national industrialization is the current historical task of our people, and it is also the basic guarantee for consolidating our national defense.
    To improve the quality of the Chinese People's Army and the organizational ability of army cadres, the central link is to strengthen the regularization and modernization construction on the existing basis of the Chinese People's Army, and to learn how to resist and defeat aggressors, which is one of the components of Stalin's military science—Stalin's military art. As Stalin pointed out in "On the Strategy and Tactics of the Russian Communists": "The task of military art is to ensure that one has all arms of service, to bring them to a state of perfection, and to be good at coordinating their actions." "The art of warfare under modern conditions consists in mastering all forms of warfare and all the scientific achievements in this respect, making rational use of them, and being good at combining them or applying one of these forms in a timely manner, depending on the circumstances." The regularization and modernization construction currently being carried out by the Chinese People's Army is to achieve the purpose of mastering Stalin's military art.
    Learning Stalin's military science and strengthening our national defense and military construction is one of the current tasks of the Chinese people and the central task of the Chinese People's Army. As a result of studying Stalin's military science, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have achieved remarkable results in equipment, organization, training, and combat methods. In the future, we must greatly strengthen the learning in this area.
    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese People's Armed Forces have defeated domestic and foreign enemies and gained exceptionally rich and valuable experience through twenty-six years of arduous struggle, which is a good foundation for further studying Stalin's military science. However, we cannot be complacent because of this, and we cannot be conservative and stagnant. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his order to the Red Army on May 1, 1943: "In military affairs, especially in modern warfare, it is impossible to stand still. To stand still in military affairs is to fall behind. As everyone knows, those who fall behind will be beaten." Therefore, we cannot adhere to past experiences and attempt to rely on these experiences to defeat any new aggressions of the enemy. Instead, we must strive to learn Stalin's military science on the basis of past experience, and raise our army to a modern military level that can defeat any new aggressors.
    To build the Chinese People's Army according to the model of the Soviet army, and to make China's national defense strong enough to be unafraid of any unexpected events, is the ideal that the Chinese people have dreamed of for many years. Today, we must work harder to gradually realize this ideal. Our national defense industry will be rapidly strengthened with the new economic construction, and the equipment of our army will also be further greatly strengthened and improved. Within the entire Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, an upsurge in learning from the Soviet army has begun, and a regularized and modernized national defense army will be rapidly built. The brilliance of Stalin's military science shines upon us, let us strive hard and forge ahead courageously!

    学习斯大林军事科学
    钟仰之
    中国人民在取得全国范围的胜利以后，在恢复国民经济的时期，从来没有放松巩固自己的武装力量和国防力量。现在，我国有计划的经济建设已经开始，为了保卫祖国的安全，保卫远东和世界的和平，准备随时粉碎帝国主义的侵略，要求我们进一步巩固和发展我国的武装力量和国防力量。因此，加速我国人民军队的正规化和现代化，就成了我国人民在大规模经济建设时期的重大任务之一。而完成这一任务的中心环节，就是要认真地学习斯大林军事科学，认真地学习苏联的先进军事经验和先进军事技术，要按照苏联军队的样式来建设中国的军队。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上指示我们：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。”“我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”这一英明的指示，对于我国的国防建设、军事建设来说，也和对于我国的经济建设、文化建设一样，是有着决定意义的。这一指示教导中国人民武装部队必须认真学习斯大林军事科学，要在全军范围内掀起学习苏联军队的热潮，来建设我们的军队，使它成为世界上最优良的最现代化的军队之一。
    斯大林军事科学是马克思列宁主义军事学说发展的新阶段，它以唯物主义为基础，接受了历史上一切军事理论的成果，解决了现代战争中战略和战术上的一切复杂问题，因而它是现代军事思想发展的最高峰，是世界上最先进的军事科学，是现代战争致胜的锁钥。它较资产阶级的军事学说具有不可比拟的优越性。布尔加宁同志说：“任何军队对强大敌人的战争的最后结果，便是它的威力，它的战斗素质、构成它编制和战斗事业基础的那种军事科学的唯一现实的尺度。”（“马克思列宁主义关于战争的基础理论”大连新华书店一九五○年版一五○页）在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队击败了横行欧洲大陆的法西斯德国的军队，歼灭了日本法西斯的精锐——关东军的事实，就是斯大林底军事科学无比优越的明证。
    斯大林军事科学最重要的原理之一，正像斯大林同志在一九四二年二月二十三日给红军的命令中指出的：“现在战争底命运将不会由突然性这种偶然因素来决定，而是要由那些经常发生作用的因素：后方的巩固性，军队底战斗精神，师团底数量和质量，军队的武装，军队长官的组织能力等来决定。”这一原理告诉我们：战争的胜负，不仅与军事建设密切相联，而且与经济、政治制度密切相联，不仅与军队的士气密切相联，而且与人民的政治觉悟密切相联，不仅与军队干部的成熟程度密切相联，而且与国家人材的成熟程度密切相联。
    斯大林军事科学的上述原理，对于我国的国防建设事业有着极其现实的指导意义。在我国的国防建设事业中，应该估计到那些对于战争经常发生作用的因素，充分发展和正确利用这些因素。
    要达到后方的巩固，取得充分的现代装备，就要巩固我国的人民民主专政，加强经济建设和文化建设，而其中心环节就是国家的工业化，尤其是重工业和国防工业的发展。毛主席教导我们“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷一一○四页）实现国家工业化，就是我国人民当前的历史任务，也就是巩固我国国防的基本保证。
    要提高中国人民军队的质量，提高军队干部的组织能力，中心环节就是要在中国人民军队的现有基础上加强正规化、现代化的建设，学会抵抗并击败侵略者的作战方法，也就是斯大林军事科学的组成部分之一——斯大林军事艺术。而这正像斯大林同志在“论俄国共产党人的战略和策略”一文中所指出的：“军事艺术的任务就在于保证自己有一切兵种，使它们臻于完善的地步，并善于把它们的行动配合起来。”“现代条件下的作战艺术，在于掌握战争的一切形式及这方面的一切科学成就，合理地利用它们，善于把它们结合起来或看情况及时地应用其中某一形式。”中国人民军队当前所正在进行的正规化现代化建设，就是为了达到掌握斯大林军事艺术的目的。
    学习斯大林军事科学，加强我国的国防建设与军事建设，是中国人民当前的任务之一，是中国人民军队当前的中心任务。中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军由于学习斯大林军事科学的结果，在装备、编制、训练和作战方法上已收到显著效果。今后更要把这一方面的学习大大加强起来。
    中国人民的武装力量，在中国共产党、毛主席、朱总司令的正确领导之下，经过了二十六年艰苦卓绝的斗争，击败了国内外敌人，获得了异常丰富和宝贵的经验，这对于进一步学习斯大林军事科学是一个良好的基础。然而，我们不能因此而自满，因此而保守不前。斯大林同志在一九四三年五月一日给红军的命令中指出：“在军事上，特别是在现代的这样战争中，是不能够停留不进的。在军事上停留不进，就是等于落伍。大家知道，落伍的人，就会挨打的。”因此，我们不能拘守过去的经验，企图依靠这些经验打败敌人可能的新的侵略。而必须在过去经验的基础上努力学习斯大林军事科学。把我们的军队提高到可以击败任何新的侵略者的现代军事水平。
    按照苏联军队的样式来建设中国人民军队，使中国的国防达到不怕任何意外事变的强固的程度，是中国人民多年来梦寐以求的理想。今天，我们要更加努力去逐步实现这个理想。我国的国防工业即将随着新的经济建设而迅速加强起来，我们军队的装备也必将进一步大大地加强和改善。在中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的全军范围之内，已开始掀起了学习苏联军队的热潮，一支正规化现代化的国防军队必将迅速地建设起来。斯大林军事科学的光辉照耀着我们，让我们奋发努力，勇猛前进吧！
