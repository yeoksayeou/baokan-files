Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: According to a report in the New York weekly "National Guardian," Ernest Weir, Chairman of the US National Steel Corporation, recently published a booklet entitled "Foreign Situation Miscellany." Based on his recent observations during a trip to Western Europe, Weir concluded that people from a broad range of social strata in Western Europe oppose war and demand peace. The United States must change its policy of refusing negotiations, otherwise it will become completely isolated.

Weir said: "The attitude of Europeans… can be explained in three sentences: First, they feel that European countries cannot continue to spend large sums of money on defense as they are currently, because they have neither the money nor the money to borrow. Second, they do not believe there is any imminent danger of war. Third, they believe that the time is ripe to take a positive attitude towards peace."

Weir spoke of the strong aversion to American war policies in Western European countries. He said: Europeans associate the danger of war with US Senator McCarthy and other extremists. Weir admitted that Europeans deeply abhor war. He pointed out that if one believes that Europeans, who have already suffered the pain of two devastating wars, would willingly accept the fate of an even more terrible third world war, it would be tantamount to "declaring them inhuman."

Weir emphasized that the strong desire for peace among the vast majority of people in all countries is irresistible. He said: "I am more deeply convinced than ever that the desire for peace is something shared by all people in the world… I believe this desire is developing into a demand from the people of all countries for their government leaders, demanding that these leaders develop ways to achieve peace—a demand so powerful that these leaders cannot ignore it."

Weir warned the United States not to continue implementing a policy of arms expansion and war preparations leading to a major war based on a negative attitude toward reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union through negotiations. He said: "If this (negative) idea becomes the basis of our course of action, the United States will become a leader without followers... Assuming we continue our current practices... from a purely material point of view, the future is terrible."

Weir concluded: "In summary, here are the conclusions I have drawn based on my personal contact in Europe and my reflection after returning home: First, we cannot 'go it alone.' Our strength is not enough to undertake this task. Any such attempt will create chaos and division in the Western world. … Second, we must treat our allies as partners. … Even if we can force others to accept our will—I doubt we can—we should remember that we cannot expect unwilling allies to do much. Third, we must do our part to negotiate with Russia. This is what European countries are willing to do, and it is what they want us to do. We should not assume any constraints in advance, nor should we try to make the Soviet Union assume any constraints in advance. We should … be prepared to negotiate peace on a fair and sincere basis. …"

    美国国民钢铁公司董事长发表欧游观感
    承认西欧人民强烈反对美国战争政策
    【新华社二十三日讯】据纽约“国民前卫”周刊报道，美国国民钢铁公司董事长欧内斯特·魏尔最近出版了一本题为“国外局势杂记”的小册子。魏尔根据他最近在西欧旅行时的观察，认定西欧广泛阶层的人民都反对战争、要求和平，美国必须改变它的拒绝协商的政策，否则将完全变成孤家寡人。
    魏尔说：“欧洲人的态度……可以用三句话来说明：一、他们感觉到欧洲各国不能继续像目前一样为防务而花费大量款项，因为它们既没有钱，也没有钱可借。二、他们不相信有任何逼近的战争危险。三、他们认为对和平采取积极态度的时机已经成熟。”
    魏尔谈到西欧各国对美国战争政策的强烈反感。他说：欧洲人把战争的危险和美国参议员麦卡锡和其他极端分子联系在一起。魏尔承认欧洲人深深厌恶战争，他指出：如果认为已经身受两次毁灭性大战痛苦的欧洲人会心甘情愿地接受更为可怕的三次大战的命运，那无异“宣告他们没有人性”。
    魏尔强调各国广大人民有着强烈的和平愿望，势不可挡。他说：“我较以往更加深信，要求和平的愿望是全世界所有人民共同拥有的东西……我相信这种愿望正在发展成为所有各国人民对于他们的政府领袖的要求，要求这些领袖发展实现和平的方法——这种要求是这样强有力，不容这些领袖们置之不顾。”
    魏尔警告美国不要对与苏联谈判取得协议事抱否定想法而继续实行导向大战的扩军备战政策。他说：“如果这种（否定）想法变成我国行动路线的基础，美国就会变成一个没有追随者的领袖……假定我们继续我们目前的做法……单从物质的观点来说，前途就很可怕。”
    魏尔最后说：“概括来说，下面就是我根据在欧洲的亲身接触和回国后的思考所得出的结论：一、我们不能‘单独干’。我们的力量不足以担当这种任务。任何这一类企图都会在西方世界中造成混乱和分裂。……二、我们必须像伙伴一样地对待我们的同盟者。……即使我们能强迫别人接受我们的意志——我怀疑能够——我们也应该记住，不能期待不情愿的同盟者作多少事情。三、我们必须尽自己的本份来和俄国进行协商。这是欧洲国家愿意做的事情，也是它们要我们去做的事情。我们不应该自己预先担承约束，我们也不应该试图要苏联预先担承约束。我们应该……准备在公平和真诚的基础上来谈判和平……。”
