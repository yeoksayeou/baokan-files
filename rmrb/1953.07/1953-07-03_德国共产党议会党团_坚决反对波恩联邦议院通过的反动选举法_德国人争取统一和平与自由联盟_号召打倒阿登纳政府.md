Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - According to TASS reports and newspaper reports: The Bonn Federal Parliament finally passed the Federal Parliament Election Law on June 26th. The Federal Parliament elections will be held this year. The new election law is blatantly reactionary, making it impossible for the broad masses of West Germans to have genuine representatives in parliament who represent their interests. The basic principles of this election law are as follows: A total of four hundred and eighty-four members are elected, of which two hundred and forty-two are produced by a relative majority of votes in the electoral districts, and the remaining two hundred and forty-two are appointed according to the principle of proportional representation, based on the state candidate lists submitted by each party. Each elector can get two votes. One vote is cast in the electoral district election, and the other vote is cast for the candidates proposed on the state list. Bonn's new election law prohibits parties participating in the election from submitting joint lists. The election law stipulates that only those parties that obtain no less than 5 percent of all valid votes on the state list in the electoral district election, or obtain at least one seat, can obtain seats allocated according to the state list. The German Communist Party parliamentary group voted against the adoption of this new election law. The German Communist Party consistently advocates the formulation and adoption of a democratic election law to ensure that the elections to the West German Federal Parliament are direct, equal and secret.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - According to TASS citing Deutsche Presse-Agentur Düsseldorf: On June 29th, the "League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom" called for the organization of a broad united front against the Adenauer government. The call was issued to all West German parties that oppose the policies of the Bonn government, stating:

Our people should never die in fratricidal wars; they must restore German unity through peaceful means. Adenauer, fearing an agreement between the great powers, resorted to the last measure. He launched "Plan X." Fortunately, his provocation did not achieve its purpose. In order to avoid repeating what has already happened, we must overthrow Adenauer in the Federal Parliament elections. The most urgent thing at the moment is that all parties opposing Adenauer must act decisively and unitedly in the election campaign. In the face of the threat of war, we should abandon prejudice and disputes. Overthrow the Adenauer government and strive for a government that advocates peaceful agreements - now, this must be the slogan of all people who demand peace.

    德国共产党议会党团
    坚决反对波恩联邦议院通过的反动选举法
    “德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟”号召打倒阿登纳政府
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：据报纸报道：波恩联邦议院于六月二十六日最后通过联邦议院选举法。联邦议院的选举将在今年内举行。新选举法具有露骨的反动性质，使西德广大人民没有可能在议会中有代表他们利益的真正代表。这一选举法的基本原则如下：一共选举四百八十四个议员，其中二百四十二个议员在选区内以相对多数票产生，其余二百四十二个议员根据比例选举原则，按各党提出的州候选人名单委任。每一个选举人可以得到两张选票。一张票在选举区选举中投，其他一张票投给按州名单提出的候选人。波恩的新选举法禁止参加选举的政党提出联合名单。选举法规定，只有那些在选举区选举中得到的票数不少于州名单候选人全部有效选票的百分之五，或者至少得到一个议席的政党才能够得到按州名单分配的席位。德国共产党议会党团投票反对通过这个新选举法。德国共产党坚持不渝地主张制订和通过一个民主的选举法，保证西德联邦议院的选举是直接的、平等的和秘密的选举。
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社引德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：六月二十九日，“德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟”号召组织一个广泛的反对阿登纳政府的统一战线。号召是对所有反对波恩政府政策的西德政党发出的，其中说：
    我们的人民决不应死于自相残杀的战争中，他们必须通过和平的方式来恢复德国的统一。阿登纳唯恐大国之间达成协议，便采取了最后的手段。他发动了“X日计划”。很幸运，他的挑衅没有达到目的。为了避免重复已经发生过的事，我们一定要在联邦议院的选举中打倒阿登纳。目前最紧迫的事便是在竞选运动中，一切反对阿登纳的党派必须坚决地统一行动。在战争威胁的面前，我们应该放弃偏见和纷争。打倒阿登纳政府，争取一个主张和平协议的政府——现在，这必须是所有要求和平的人们的口号。
