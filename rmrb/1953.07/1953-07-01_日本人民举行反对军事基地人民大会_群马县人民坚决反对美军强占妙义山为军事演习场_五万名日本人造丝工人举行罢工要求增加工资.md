Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: Tokyo news: The People's Congress Against Military Bases, marking the beginning of the Japanese "Peace Month" (June 25th to August 15th), was held in Tokyo on the 25th and 26th.

Under the leadership of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, the preparatory work for the People's Congress Against Military Bases has been actively underway for a long time. The Preparatory Committee included many famous Japanese peace activists such as Ikuo Oyama, Yoshitaro Hirano, Jiichiro Matsumoto, and Koichi Saionji. The congress plans to unite the struggles against military bases across the country and launch a large-scale mass movement against military bases, regardless of party affiliation or ideology.

More than 500 representatives of people living in military base areas across the country, as well as representatives of trade unions and democratic groups, attended the People's Congress Against Military Bases. The meeting discussed the issue of removing military bases.

Now, the activities of "Peace Month" have officially begun. The number of trade unions and other organizations participating in Peace Month is increasing daily. A variety of meaningful activities are being planned and initiated.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: Tokyo news: The people of Gunma Prefecture, Japan, are resolutely opposing the U.S. military's preparation to take over the local scenic spot, Mount Myogi, as a military training ground. Since the so-called U.S.-Japan Joint Committee designated Mount Myogi as a U.S. military training ground, this plan has been resolutely opposed by the local people. In order to force the local people to abandon their opposition struggle, the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee convened a so-called "Consultation Meeting on the Acquisition of Land in Mount Myogi, Gunma Prefecture" on the 26th. However, both inside and outside the meeting, the local people unanimously expressed their firm will to oppose the U.S. military's acquisition of Mount Myogi. Outside the meeting hall, more than 4,000 workers and farmers formed a demonstration procession, holding up protest banners and flags. When representatives of the U.S. military and the Yoshida government arrived, they angrily shouted, "Get back where you came from!" Inside the meeting hall, 500 people's representatives struggled.

When Yaguchi, a representative of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, prepared to speak, the local people's representatives immediately stopped him with shouts of "Absolutely oppose the acquisition!" Subsequently, the people's representatives expressed their opinions against the acquisition of Mount Myogi one after another. Finally, 500 people's representatives expressed their opposition to the acquisition by leaving the meeting together. At this time, the demonstrators who surrounded the meeting hall surged into the hall with激愤 (激愤 is an emotion so I will translate it as indignation, but please remember that this word can also mean fury or anger). The U.S. military representatives were so frightened that they fled in embarrassment.

After expelling the representatives of the U.S. military and the Yoshida government, the demonstrators, in high spirits, immediately convened the "Prefectural People's Congress Against the Acquisition of Mount Myogi." The congress passed a resolution resolutely opposing the transformation of Mount Myogi into a U.S. military training ground.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: Tokyo news: 50,000 workers from Japan's five major rayon companies, "Toyo," "Kurashiki," "Teikoku," "Toho," and "Mitsubishi," went on an indefinite strike starting on the 29th. The strike was caused by the management's refusal to accept the workers' reasonable demand for a wage increase. Workers from Asahi Kasei Industries, another rayon manufacturing company, are also preparing to join the strike from July 1st. (Picture attached)

    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：标志着日本“和平月”（六月二十五日到八月十五日）开始的反对军事基地人民大会，已于二十五日和二十六日在东京举行。
    在日本拥护和平委员会的领导下，反对军事基地人民大会的筹备工作，很早以前就在积极进行了。筹备委员包括：大山郁夫、平野义太郎、松本治一郎、西园寺公一等许多日本著名和平人士。大会计划把全国各地反对军事基地的斗争统一起来，展开一个不分党派和思想的大规模的反对军事基地群众运动。
    参加这次反对军事基地人民大会的有居住在全国各军事基地区域的人民代表和工会、民主团体等代表共五百多人。会上讨论了撤除军事基地的问题。
    现在，“和平月”的活动已经正式开始。参加和平月的工会等团体，日有增加。多种多样有意义的活动已在计划和开始进行中。
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本群马县人民正在坚决地反对美国准备接收当地的名胜妙义山为军事演习场。自从所谓美日联合委员会指定妙义山为美军演习场以来，这个计划就遭到了当地人民的坚决反对。为了强迫当地人民放弃反对斗争，美日联合委员会在二十六日召开了一个所谓“接收群马县妙义出现地恳谈会”。但是，当地人民无论在会上和会外，一致表示了他们反对美军接收妙义山的坚决意志。在会场外面，四千名以上的工人和农民等组成了示威队伍，高举着抗议的标语牌和旗子。当美军和吉田政府的代表来临时，他们愤怒地高喊：“快点滚回去！”在会场里面，有五百名人民代表在斗争。
    当吉田政府农林省的代表矢口准备发言时，当地人民代表立即用“绝对反对接收！”的呼声喝止住了他。接着，人民代表们纷纷发表了反对接收妙义山的意见。最后，五百名人民代表用一齐退场的行动来表示反对接收。这时，围满在会场四周的示威群众激愤地拥入了会场。吓得美军代表狼狈地逃走。
    示威群众在驱逐了美军和吉田政府的代表之后，在高涨的情绪下立刻召开了“反对接收妙义山县民大会”。大会通过了坚决反对变妙义山为美军演习场的决议。
     【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本五大人造丝公司“东洋”、“仓敷”、“帝国”、“东邦”、“三菱”的五万名工人，从二十九日起举行无一定限期的罢工。罢工起因于资方拒绝接受工人提出的合理增加工资的要求。另一家制造人造丝的公司旭化成工业公司的工人，也准备从七月一日起，参加罢工。（附图片）
