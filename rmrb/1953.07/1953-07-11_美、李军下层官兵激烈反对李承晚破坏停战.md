Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Lower-level U.S. soldiers who yearn for an early armistice are extremely annoyed by Syngman Rhee's increasingly rampant sabotage of the armistice under U.S. indulgence, and their morale is even lower.

United Press reporter Hanson reported from the western front in Korea on the 8th that Syngman Rhee "may well be the person most hated in the world by the Allied soldiers." Hanson reported the opinions of soldiers in a U.S. company. A young officer said: "I don't think there's a single person here who wouldn't want to shoot Syngman Rhee in order to end the war, and it wouldn't be a pity if he died in the electric chair." A soldier who did not want to be named cursed Syngman Rhee, saying, "That son of a bitch should be hanged." Second Lieutenant Jones said, "The morale of the men is very low, and they are complaining like crazy." Sergeant Hallcom said that Syngman Rhee's behavior "makes us think they are simply pulling our legs."

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th, an officer at the U.S. Far East Command also believed that the U.S. must take measures to stop Syngman Rhee's sabotage. He said, "Now, the dog's tail is wagging, causing the dog's body to shake violently. The only way seems to be to make this dog turn around and bite its own tail."

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: The Syngman Rhee gang's actions against the armistice have been met with fierce opposition from lower-level soldiers of the ROK army.

Associated Press reporter Randolph reported from Seoul on the 7th that ROK soldiers are eager for a swift armistice, and they are "no longer willing to die before others, especially, they don't want to make meaningless sacrifices." Some said that if Syngman Rhee ordered them to disregard the armistice agreement and attack the communists alone, they "would resist." Some people "strongly oppose Syngman Rhee's policies, and they even hinted at using military rebellion or a coup d'état to save South Korea." A person working in a ROK army headquarters who did not want to reveal his name or rank said: "We have been fighting for three years now. We are very tired. The whole army is very tired. We are sick of this war and this slaughter. Really, now we hope to be able to stop and rest." This person also said, "It is easy to hold parades and demonstrations in Seoul," but "the soldiers are not holding parades and demonstrations, they are busy climbing mountains," and they are very tired of the war. All that is needed is peace. Randolph said that some influential officers and more educated soldiers "expressed varying degrees of doubt as to whether Syngman Rhee's fierce opposition to the armistice is wise, and frankly expressed such opinions."

The "World Dispatch Column" of "U.S. News & World Report" also reported on the 3rd that "Syngman Rhee's threat to withdraw his troops from the United Nations Command has damaged the morale of the Korean army." The magazine said that the ROK army often "retreated in the face of battle."

    美、李军下层官兵激烈反对李承晚破坏停战
    【新华社十日讯】渴望早日停战的美军下层官兵，对于李承晚在美国纵容之下愈益猖狂地破坏停战，感到十分恼怒，士气更加低落。
    合众社记者韩森八日自朝鲜西线报道说，李承晚“或许竟是联军士兵在世界上最痛恨的一个人”。韩森报道了美军一个连里官兵们的意见。一个青年军官说：“我以为这里没有一个人不想一枪打死李承晚，以便使战争结束，即使他坐在电椅上死去也不可惜他。”一个不愿透露姓名的士兵大骂李承晚说：“应当把这个狗养的吊死。”少尉排长琼斯说：“弟兄们的士气很低，他们疯狂地抱怨。”上士霍尔孔说，李承晚的行为“使我们认为他们简直是在扯我们的腿。”
    另据美联社东京八日电报道，美军远东司令部的一个军官也认为，美方必须采取措施制止李承晚的破坏行为。他说：“现在，狗的尾巴摇摆着，正使狗身子受到激烈的震动，唯一的办法，似乎只有使这只狗回过头来咬它自己的尾巴。”
    【新华社九日讯】李承晚匪帮反对停战的行动，遭受到李伪军下层官兵的激烈反对。
    美联社记者伦道夫七日从汉城报道说，李伪军士兵渴望迅速实现停战，他们“不再愿意在别人之前去送死，尤其是，他们不想作无谓的牺牲”。有些人说，如果李承晚下令叫他们不顾停战协定，并且单独进攻共军，他们“将予以抗拒”。有的人“强烈地反对李承晚的政策，他们甚至暗示用军事叛变或武力政变来挽救南朝鲜”。一个在李伪军某司令部工作的不肯透露姓名职级的人说：“到现在我们已打了三年了。我们感到很疲倦。整个军队都是很疲倦。我们厌恶这个战争和这种屠杀。真的，现在我们希望能够停下来休息一下。”这个人还说，“在汉城举行游行示威是容易的事情”，但是“士兵们并不举行游行示威，他们爬山够忙的了”，他们对战争已经十分厌倦了。唯一需要的就是和平。伦道夫说，一部分有势力的军官和文化程度较高的士兵“对于李承晚激烈反对停战的立场是否明智，表示不同程度的怀疑，并且坦然无隐地表示这样的意见”。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”的“世界电讯栏”在三日也报道说，“李承晚要把他的军队从联合国军司令部抽调出来的威胁，已经使韩军的士气受到损害。”该杂志说，李伪军常常“临阵退缩”。
