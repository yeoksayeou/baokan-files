Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to the Polish News Agency, many important industrial sectors in Poland have completed their first-half production plans ahead of schedule. As early as June 2nd, miners from the Ruda United Coalfields reported the good news of completing their half-year plan. Subsequently, by June 28th, Poland's coal mining industry had entirely completed its half-year production plan. Due to the increased level of mechanization in coal mining, the amount of coal loaded by machinery in May increased by 20% compared to May of the previous year. By the end of the second quarter, the average daily coal production of the entire coal mining industry was 11,600 tons more than the same quarter last year. The metallurgical industry also completed its half-year plan ahead of schedule. The steel production plan was completed on June 26th, while the production of pig iron and coke was completed on June 29th. The shipbuilding industry completed its half-year plan four days ahead of schedule, manufacturing 3.4 times more seagoing vessels for the state in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year. In addition, Polish railway workers also successfully completed their half-year transportation plan ahead of schedule. In the Polish machine industry, the nationally renowned Ursus Tractor Factory, following the great victory of celebrating the production of the 20,000th tractor on April 16th, also announced the good news of completing its half-year plan ahead of schedule on June 23rd.

The achievement of Polish industrial sectors in completing their half-year production plans ahead of schedule is inseparable from the various socialist emulation campaigns enthusiastically launched by Polish workers. The long-term emulation campaign launched by Polish workers since March to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs has given an important impetus to the implementation of the production plan. In the first quarter, they overfulfilled the quarterly industrial production plan by 103.1%. From April, the workers combined the long-term emulation with the May Day Labor Day emulation. The "no defective products" movement initiated by advanced worker Shay of the Starachowice Automobile Factory was also echoed by workers in many factories. By the end of May, many important industrial sectors had completed their May plans ahead of schedule. For example, pig iron reached 101.3%, steel 101.5%, coke 103.8%, and coal 100.5%. In June, while completing the half-year plan ahead of schedule, Polish workers launched a blitz emulation campaign in combination with the long-term emulation to welcome the 9th anniversary of the National Day and the 1st anniversary of the adoption of the People's Republic Constitution (July 22nd).

    波兰许多重要工业部门
    提前完成今年上半年生产计划
    【新华社三日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰许多重要工业部门提前完成半年生产计划。早在六月二日，鲁达联合煤场的矿工们首先报告完成半年计划的喜讯，接着，到六月二十八日，波兰的采煤业就全部完成了半年的生产计划。由于采煤机械化水平的提高，今年五月，用机械装运的煤，就比去年五月增加了百分之二十，到第二季结束时，整个采煤业每昼夜的平均采煤量比去年同季多一万一千六百吨。冶金工业也提前完成了半年计划，其中，钢材的生产计划在六月二十六日就完成了，铸铁和焦炭的生产在六月二十九日完成了半年计划。造船业提前四天完成了半年计划，今年上半年给国家制造的海船比去年上半年多三点四倍。此外，波兰的铁路工人也胜利地提前完成了半年运输计划。在波兰机器工业中，全国驰名的乌尔苏斯拖拉机工厂，继四月十六日庆祝第二万台拖拉机出厂的巨大胜利之后，在六月二十三日又传出了提前完成半年计划的好消息。
    波兰工业部门提前完成半年生产计划的成就是和波兰工人热烈展开的各种社会主义竞赛分不开的。从今年三月起波兰工人为增加产量提高质量和减低成本而展开的长期竞赛运动，给予生产计划的执行以重要的推动力量。他们在第一季中超额完成了工业生产季度计划的百分之一百零三点一。从四月起，工人们把长期竞赛和纪念“五一”劳动节的竞赛结合起来，斯塔拉霍维茨汽车工厂先进工人沙伊首倡的“不出次货”运动，也受到许多工厂工人的响应，到五月底，许多重要的工业部门纷纷提前完成了五月份计划，例如，生铁完成了百分之一百零一点三，钢完成了百分之一百零一点五，焦炭百分之一百零三点八，煤百分之一百零点五。六月间，波兰工人在提前完成半年计划的日子里，为了迎接国庆节九周年和通过人民共和国宪法一周年（七月二十二日），又展开了与长期竞赛相结合的突击性竞赛运动。
