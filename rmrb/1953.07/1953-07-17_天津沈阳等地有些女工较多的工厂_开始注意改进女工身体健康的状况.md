    Some Factories with Many Female Workers in Tianjin, Shenyang and Other Places
    Begin to Pay Attention to Improving the Health Conditions of Female Workers
    [Reported by this newspaper] Factories with a relatively large number of female workers in Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Beijing and other places have begun to pay attention to improving the health conditions of female workers in order to reduce female workers' illnesses and absenteeism.
    According to the information obtained by the Urban Work Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation: In addition to lax labor discipline, the main reasons for the high absenteeism rate of female workers are the relatively high prevalence of gynecological diseases and family burdens. Among 252 female workers in Harbin Woolen Mill and Rubber Factory No. 6 in Northeast China, 202 suffered from various diseases of varying degrees. In March of this year, the absenteeism rate of female workers in the fine yarn class C of the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory accounted for 9.59 percent, of which absenteeism due to illness accounted for 58 percent. In August last year, a total of 957 workers took sick leave in Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, of which 615 were female workers. Among female workers' diseases, gynecological diseases are more common. According to a survey of eight enterprises in North China in August 1952, among 1,894 sick female workers, 1,062 suffered from gynecological diseases. The causes of this disease are mostly due to the lack of scientific hygiene knowledge and habits among female workers, as well as the lack of necessary sanitary facilities in factories.
    In the three years since liberation, the factories in the above-mentioned areas have made great improvements in the safety and sanitary equipment for female workers, but due to the limitations of conditions, they cannot meet the current needs for a while. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of gynecological diseases must start from strengthening the health education of female workers and gradually making some necessary measures. At present, these issues have attracted the attention of the administrative leaders of the factories in the above-mentioned areas. Based on these situations, in coordination with the trade union, the Democratic Women's Federation and the Maternal and Child Health Station, various measures are taken to promote the health of female workers. In some factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Nantong and other nine cities, female workers' hygiene rooms have been established to help female workers use scientific methods for sanitary disposal during menstruation, and reduce diseases and absenteeism caused by improper menstrual disposal. Some factories in Tianjin hold female workers' health radio lectures to educate female workers on health care knowledge such as menstrual hygiene, prenatal and postnatal hygiene. Some factories in Chongqing have specifically added gynecology departments in the medical rooms, with full-time medical staff regularly checking and treating female workers' diseases. Sichuan State-owned Factory 611 used waste iron pipes to transform more than 60 shower facilities, which solved the problem of female workers contracting diseases due to improper bathing. In some places, the trade union's female workers' department, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Maternal and Child Health Station jointly organized working groups to select key factories, conduct comprehensive health checks and key treatments for female workers, and study the experience of health care work for female workers for promotion. For example, Tianjin organized a working group to conduct key tests at the State-owned No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory. The working group was divided into three groups: health, prevention and treatment, and the test results were good.
    All these measures to improve the health of female workers have had a positive impact on promoting the health of female workers, reducing female workers' diseases, and improving production efficiency. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, leg pain, and back pain during menstruation in female workers in many factories have been greatly reduced. Many female workers suffering from gynecological diseases have developed hygienic habits, and more and more people are taking the initiative to check their diseases and using scientific methods to deal with their gynecological diseases. Before listening to the female workers' health radio lectures, a total of 136 people in the first sewing department of Tianjin Clothing Factory suffered from menstrual diseases. After listening to the lectures for six months, the number of people suffering from the disease has been reduced to 59. Since the establishment of the female workers' hygiene room in the weaving workshop of the State-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory in December last year, the absenteeism of female workers due to gynecological diseases has gradually decreased. In April 1953, only 13 workers were absent due to gynecological diseases, a decrease of 20 workers compared with November 1952. Some female workers have also expanded their viewing capacity and improved the quality of production. For example, female worker Zhu Guizhen used to watch ten machines, but now she can watch twelve machines and complete the task on time. Many female workers with more serious gynecological diseases have recovered their health after treatment. After adding a gynecology department to the medical room of Chongqing China Wool Textile Factory, it has cured various gynecological diseases for more than 40 female workers.

    天津沈阳等地有些女工较多的工厂
    开始注意改进女工身体健康的状况
    【本报讯】    天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、上海、武汉、重庆、北京等地有些女工较多的工厂，开始注意改进女工身体健康的状况，以减少女工疾病与缺勤现象。
    据中华全国民主妇女联合会城市工作部的了解：造成女工缺勤率较大的原因，除因劳动纪律松弛外，主要是目前女工中患妇科病的比较普遍和家务牵累。东北哈尔滨毛织厂和橡胶六厂二百五十二名女工中，二百零二名都有各种各样不同程度的疾病。国营天津第三棉纺织厂细纱丙班女工，今年三月份缺勤率占百分之九·五九，其中因疾病缺勤的就占了百分之五十八。上海国营第一棉纺织厂在去年八月份，因病请假的工人共有九百五十七名，其中女工占六百一十五人。在女工疾病中，以妇科病较为普遍。据一九五二年八月华北区八个企业单位的调查，在一千八百九十四名患病女工中，患妇科病的有一千零六十二人。产生这种病的原因，多半由于女工缺乏科学的卫生常识和习惯以及工厂中缺乏必要的卫生设备。
    在解放三年来，上述地区的工厂对于女工的安全卫生设备，虽有很大的改进，但由于条件的限制，一时还不能适应目前需要。因此对于妇科病的预防与治疗问题，必须从加强对女工的卫生教育和逐步地作出一些必要的措施方面着手。目前这些问题已引起上述地区的工厂行政领导方面的注意，根据这些情况，配合工会、民主妇女联合会和妇幼卫生站，采取各项措施，来增进女工的健康。在天津、上海、武汉、沈阳、南通等九市的某些工厂中，建立了女工卫生室，帮助女工在月经期间用科学办法进行卫生处置，减少由于月经处置不当所引起的疾病与缺勤现象。天津有些工厂举办女工卫生广播讲座，向女工进行月经卫生、产前产后卫生等保健卫生常识的教育。重庆市有些工厂在医务室中专门增设了妇科室，有专职的医务人员经常检查和治疗女工的疾病。四川国营六一一厂用废铁管改装成六十多个淋浴设备，解决了女工因洗澡不慎传染了疾病的问题。还有些地方由工会女工部、民主妇女联合会和妇幼卫生站共同组织工作组，选择重点工厂，对女工健康进行全面检查和重点治疗，研究对女工进行保健工作的经验，以资推广。如天津市曾组织工作组，到国营第四棉纺织厂去作重点试验。该工作组分为健康、预防及治疗三个组，试验结果良好。
    所有这些改进女工健康的措施，对于增进女工的健康，减少女工的疾病，以及对生产效率的提高，都发生了良好的影响。许多工厂女工在经期中腹疼、腿疼、腰酸的症状大为减少。很多患妇女病的女工已养成了卫生习惯，有病就主动去检查，运用科学办法来处理自己妇女病的人已逐渐增多。天津被服厂第一缝纫部在听女工卫生广播讲座前患月经病的共有一百三十六人，她们听了六个月的课后，患病的人数已减少到五十九人。国营天津第五棉纺织厂织布车间自去年十二月建立女工卫生室后，女工因妇女病缺勤的逐渐减少，一九五三年四月因妇女病缺勤的仅十三个工，比一九五二年十一月减少了二十个工。有些女工并扩大了看台能力，提高了生产质量，如女工朱桂珍原来看十台车，现在已能看十二台车，并能按期完成任务。不少有较重妇科病的女工经过治疗后，恢复了健康。重庆市中国毛纺织厂在医务室中增设了妇科室后，已给四十多名女工治好了各种妇女病。
