The wheat harvest season came early this year across the country. In late April, some areas of Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan and other provinces began to harvest wheat. In May, new wheat was also put on the market successively in the Yangtze River basin and south of the Yangtze River in Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces. In late June, new wheat was successively put on the market in large quantities in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hebei and other provinces, as well as in the southern regions of Shanxi and Shaanxi.

Before the new wheat was available in large quantities, the grain departments in various regions had made timely preparations for the purchase of wheat. With the launch of new wheat on the market, the procurement work of the grain departments and cooperatives in various regions was rapidly launched. The state's plan for purchasing wheat was overfulfilled by 100% in May, and 151.5% of the original plan was completed in June, an increase of 159.34% over the same period last year.

The reasons for the over-fulfillment of the wheat procurement plan in May and June this year are as follows:

First, Party and government leading organs at all levels actively led the wheat procurement work. In some regions, such as Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan provinces, a wheat procurement office was established under the unified leadership of the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee to guide the wheat procurement work in a unified manner. Some special district, county, and district Party and government leaders also personally led the procurement work.

Second, the wheat procurement base price determined this year was higher than last year, and the exchange ratio of wheat to rice and coarse grains has increased compared with last year. Farmers actively sold new wheat, and the amount of wheat purchased by the state rapidly increased. Judging from the amount purchased daily in various provinces, the average daily purchase volume in Jiangsu Province in mid-June increased more than six times compared with the average daily purchase volume in early June; Hubei increased by two times; Henan, Zhejiang and other provinces had varying degrees of increase.

Third, state-owned grain departments have strengthened their leadership and management of the grain market.

Fourth, cooperatives and grain departments have set up purchasing points and stations in rural areas. In mid-June, cooperatives in Anhui Province set up 783 purchasing points and stations in rural areas. Including those set up by grain departments, the province had a total of 970 purchasing points and stations. In late June, cooperatives and grain departments in Shandong Province had nearly 3,000 purchasing points and stations. Due to the widespread establishment of purchasing points and stations in rural areas, farmers found it convenient to sell wheat, and the proportion of wheat purchased by cooperatives on behalf of the state also increased significantly. According to statistics from Shandong and Anhui provinces in mid-June, the amount purchased by cooperatives on behalf of the state accounted for 70% to 80% of the total purchase amount.

Fifth, some cooperative and grain department staff improved their business methods and improved their work efficiency. Some areas have found ways to overcome the phenomenon of farmers waiting for inspection, weighing, and payment when selling wheat. Yichang Special District in Hubei Province and some areas in Sichuan Province adopted scientific payment methods, which greatly shortened the time for converting wheat into cash. Cooperatives in Dengfeng and Tongxu counties in Henan Province had a full understanding of the needs of farmers in advance, and then regularly allocated goods to the countryside to exchange for wheat, which was warmly welcomed by farmers and created a new record of one person exchanging 7,000 catties of wheat in one day. Some procurement teams in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, organized mutual aid groups to sell wheat collectively, with good results.

However, some areas underestimated the wheat production situation, and the procurement plan was too small. The actual procurement figures exceeded the planned figures by too much, which caused insufficient capital scheduling and insufficient grain storage capacity. In June, the procurement figures in Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other provinces exceeded the plan by 100%, and Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and other provinces also exceeded the plan by more than 80%, so some areas could not purchase enough. Individual areas did not dare to let go of wheat procurement due to insufficient storage capacity. In addition, some areas did not do enough in supplying means of production and means of livelihood when cooperating with wheat procurement, and could not meet the needs of farmers.

Currently, the peak of wheat marketing has gradually shifted northward from the Yangtze River basin. Grain departments and cooperatives in Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other major wheat-producing areas should make preparations as soon as possible in order to successfully complete the task of wheat procurement.

### 五六月份小麦收购计划超额完成  北方各省要做好物资供应工作争取更大成绩

    五六月份小麦收购计划超额完成
    北方各省要做好物资供应工作争取更大成绩
    【本报讯】全国各地今年小麦成熟时期较早，四月下旬，广东、福建、云南等省部分地区已开始收割小麦。五月份，长江流域及长江以南的广西、四川、湖北、江西、浙江等省，新麦也先后上市。六月下旬，江苏、安徽、山东、河南、河北等省及山西、陕西两省的南部地区，新麦相继大量上市。
    在新麦还没有大量上市以前，各地粮食部门就及时做好了收购小麦的准备工作。随着新麦上市，各地粮食部门和合作社的收购工作迅速展开。国家收购小麦的计划，五月份超额一倍完成，六月份完成了原计划百分之一百五十一点五，较去年同时期收购量增加了百分之一百五十九点三四。
    今年五、六月份超额完成小麦收购计划的原因如下：
    一、各级党政领导机关积极领导小麦收购工作。部分地区如山东、河北、山西、河南等省，在省财政经济委员会的统一领导下，成立了小麦收购办公室，统一指导小麦收购工作。有些专区、县、区的党、政负责人并亲自领导收购工作。
    二、今年确定的小麦收购基价比去年高，小麦与大米、粗粮的交换比率都比去年增加，农民踊跃出售新麦，国家收购小麦数量迅速增加。从各省每天收购的数量来看，江苏省六月中旬平均日收购量较上旬平均日收购量增加了六倍以上；湖北增加了二倍；河南、浙江等省都有程度不同的增加。
    三、国营粮食部门加强了对粮食市场的领导与管理。
    四、合作社与粮食部门深入农村设立收购点、站。六月中旬，安徽省合作社就在农村设立了七百八十三个收购点、站，连粮食部门设立的计算在内，全省共有九百七十个收购点、站。六月下旬，山东省合作社与粮食部门所设的收购点、站即近三千个。由于在农村普遍设立收购点、站，农民售麦方便，合作社代购小麦的比重也显著增加。据山东、安徽两省六月中旬的统计，合作社代购数量占收购总量的百分之七十至八十。
    五、部分合作社与粮食部门的工作人员改进经营方法，提高了工作效率。有的地区在收购中设法克服了农民卖麦时等待检品、等待过秤、等待付款的现象。湖北宜昌专区及四川部分地区，采用了科学的付款办法，大大缩短了小麦折合现款的时间。河南省登封、通许等县的合作社，事先对农民的需要进行了充分的了解，然后定期拨货下乡换购小麦，受到农民的热烈欢迎，创造了一人一天换购七千斤小麦的新纪录。江苏省吴江县有的收购组，组织互助组集体售麦，效果很好。
    但是部分地区对小麦生产情况估计不足，制订的收购计划偏小，实际收购数字超过计划数字太大，这就造成资金调度不及、粮仓容不下的现象。六月份四川、浙江、江西等省的收购数字都超过计划一倍，江苏、安徽、湖北等省也超过计划百分之八十以上，部分地区因此收购不及。个别地区因仓容不足，不敢放手收购小麦。此外，部分地区在配合收购小麦时，对生产资料和生活资料的供应工作做得很不够，不能满足农民的需要。
    目前，小麦上市的旺潮已由长江流域逐渐北移。山东、河北、山西、陕西等主要产麦地区的粮食部门与合作社应该及早做好准备工作，以便圆满地完成收购小麦的任务。
