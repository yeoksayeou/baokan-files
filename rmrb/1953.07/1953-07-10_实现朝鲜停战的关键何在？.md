    The sincere efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides to seek an armistice in Korea were once again fully demonstrated in the reply of Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, on July 7 to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces, regarding his letter of June 29. This reply solemnly pointed out that the U.S. side bears an unavoidable responsibility for the acts of the Syngman Rhee clique in undermining the armistice agreement and obstructing the realization of the armistice. However, given that the U.S. side expressed its desire to strive for an early armistice and provided assurances, our side agreed that the two delegations should meet regularly to discuss the implementation of the armistice agreement and various preparations before the signing of the armistice agreement. The outcome of this negotiation will undoubtedly be of close concern to the governments and peoples of all countries around the world.
    What the result of this negotiation will be is a matter to be judged by the facts. And all the current facts have very clearly shown that whether the U.S. side can effectively assume its responsibility and ensure that the armistice agreement is indeed observed and implemented is the only key to whether the Korean armistice can be achieved. As Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai said in their reply to Clark's letter: "Our side believes that your side must take effective measures regarding the South Korean government and army's compliance with the armistice agreement and all related agreements in order to ensure that the Korean armistice is not undermined." Although Clark's letter also stated that "where necessary, the United Nations Command will do its utmost to establish military defense measures to ensure that the terms of the armistice will be observed." This assurance is absolutely necessary, and therefore it is what we demand. It is precisely because the U.S. side provided such assurances that our side agreed that the two delegations should continue negotiations. However, Clark's letter is not entirely satisfactory because he has not provided definite and effective assurances on many important issues. Therefore, people should never be too optimistic about the U.S. side's so-called "guarantee." Our side has already pointed out to the U.S. side in the reply letter: "Your side has expressed that it is not really certain that the South Korean government and army will abide by the armistice agreement reached by the two delegations." This shows that the U.S. side's so-called "guarantee" is very unreliable.
    A fundamental fact makes it impossible to believe that the U.S. side's "guarantee" is reliable. This is that the U.S. government has not only not abandoned its policy of condoning Syngman Rhee, but is also increasingly encouraging Syngman Rhee's destructive behavior. The current policy of the U.S. government is said to be to "persuade" the Syngman Rhee clique to accept the armistice; senior officials of the U.S. State Department have also told its "allies" that "there are many ways to persuade Syngman Rhee to accept the armistice." However, the protracted negotiations between U.S. President's special envoy Robertson and Syngman Rhee in Seoul proved that the U.S. government's so-called "persuasion" policy not only failed to persuade Syngman Rhee to accept the armistice, but also encouraged the Syngman Rhee clique to more arrogantly undermine the realization of the armistice. On the third day of Robertson's arrival in South Korea, he agreed to conclude a "military alliance" with the Syngman Rhee clique. Now, according to U.S. news agencies, Robertson has proposed a "wonderful plan" to Syngman Rhee, promising that if the political conference after the armistice makes no progress in discussing the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea within ninety days, the United States will withdraw from the political conference together with the Syngman Rhee clique; at this time, the United States is willing to "discuss resuming the war" with the Syngman Rhee clique through diplomatic channels. Republican Senator Nolan has repeatedly publicly declared that even if Syngman Rhee takes "go it alone" actions, the U.S. government cannot cut off aid to Syngman Rhee in terms of equipment and supplies. This seems to be saying that the United States will continue to supply Syngman Rhee with arms, allowing the Syngman Rhee clique to "fight on their own." May I ask, does such a "persuasion" method guarantee an armistice or guarantee the destruction of an armistice? Isn't it obvious to anyone with discerning eyes?
    Similarly, what is manifested in the actions of the U.S. military in Korea is that Clark's headquarters has consistently lacked the serious effort to fulfill the conditions of the "guarantee" he himself provided. Ten days have passed since Clark's letter of June 29 proposing the "guarantee," but the chaotic situation in South Korea has not only not been clarified, but has further developed. Taking the example of prisoners of war mentioned in Clark's letter, he guaranteed on the one hand: "The United Nations Command is continuing its efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war"; on the other hand, he said: "It is impossible to recover all these prisoners of war...because they have disappeared into the residents, and these residents are intentionally harboring and protecting them." However, according to reports from U.S. news agencies, these prisoners of war are still openly staying in Busan and other places, "sitting in large trucks, passing through the streets of Busan," and being transported to the replenishment stations of the Rhee puppet army near Busan. U.S. news agencies also reported that many prisoners of war "are willing to return to the Allied forces," and the "people of South Korea are really too poor" and "too lazy to maintain the lives of the released prisoners of war." This shows that Clark has not seriously implemented his "guarantee." If Clark's headquarters does not change this attitude, then the so-called "guarantee" of the Korean armistice, of course, has no reliable basis.
    The most undeniable fact about the reliability of the U.S. side's "guarantee" is that the Syngman Rhee clique's direct sabotage of the Korean armistice is increasing. Since Syngman Rhee forcibly detained prisoners of war on a large scale on June 18, not only has he not shown the slightest remorse, but he has also been clamoring more and more frantically to "unify Korea by force." According to U.S. news agencies, the Syngman Rhee clique has formulated a new conspiracy plan to undermine the Korean armistice. This plan attempts to further "release" those Korean prisoners of war who are still in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps in order to continue to obstruct the signing of the armistice agreement, and prepares to refuse to withdraw the South Korean army from the front line in order to destroy the establishment of the demilitarized zone; at the same time, it is stepping up its collusion with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, attempting to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers; and threatening to use force to oppose the Indian troops going to South Korea to perform the task of supervising prisoners of war by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The facts that have occurred in South Korea in recent days show that Syngman Rhee's conspiracy plan is continuing. If such frantic activities of the Syngman Rhee clique cannot be effectively curbed, then the U.S. side's so-called "guarantee" of the armistice is obviously unreliable.
    What is a reliable "guarantee" for achieving the Korean armistice? It is not only a verbal guarantee, a written guarantee, but more importantly, a guarantee of practical action. Now, if the U.S. side is willing to make the Korean armistice a reality as soon as possible, it must take practical actions that make people believe that its "guarantee" is indeed reliable. That is, the U.S. side must take practical action to effectively handle the incident of the Syngman Rhee clique forcibly detaining prisoners of war. According to what Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai pointed out in their reply to Clark, the United States, on the one hand, "bears full responsibility for recovering all of the prisoners of war who 'escaped' this time at any time"; on the other hand, for Syngman Rhee's attempt to continue to kidnap more than 8,000 remaining prisoners of the Korean People's Army and collude with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in an attempt to coerce captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to leave the prisoner-of-war camps, "must bear absolute responsibility to ensure that such incidents do not happen again." That is, the U.S. side must take practical action to effectively guarantee that the Syngman Rhee clique can fully comply with and implement all the terms of the armistice agreement, so that on the day the armistice agreement comes into effect, a comprehensive ceasefire will be implemented on the Korean front, and all troops on both sides will completely withdraw from the military demarcation line and establish a demilitarized zone. That is, the U.S. side must take practical action to effectively guarantee the safety of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian armed forces and our side's interpreters, so as to avoid persecution by the Syngman Rhee clique. The U.S. side must use these practical actions to prove to the people of the world and make the people of the world deeply believe that it has the ability to fulfill the obligations undertaken in the armistice agreement.
    At present, the feelings of the people all over the world demanding the realization of an armistice in Korea are extremely urgent. Even at the United Nations, the spokespersons of the governments of the sixteen countries that have troops participating in the U.S. operations in Korea also issued a statement on the 6th of this month, urging the U.S. side to sign the armistice agreement directly, regardless of the obstruction of the Syngman Rhee clique. Is the U.S. government going to continue to condone the Syngman Rhee clique's destruction of the armistice? Or is it willing to truly guarantee the realization of the armistice? Now is the time to make a decision. Our Korean and Chinese sides will not change our desire to seek an armistice in Korea and seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue under any circumstances, and will continue to make unremitting efforts for this purpose. The reply letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to Clark represents a new effort. Our efforts are fully in line with the desire of the people all over the world to achieve an armistice in Korea as soon as possible. However, we must once again emphasize that the key to whether the Korean armistice can be realized has always been, and now even more so, on the side of the United States.

### 实现朝鲜停战的关键何在？

    实现朝鲜停战的关键何在？
    朝中方面为谋求朝鲜停战所作的真诚努力，从朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军七月七日对美军总司令克拉克六月二十九日来信的答复中，又一次充分地表现出来了。这封复信严正地指出了美方对于李承晚集团破坏停战协议和阻挠停战实现的行为应负无可逃避的责任。但鉴于美方表示了努力达成早日停战的愿望及所提供的保证，我方同意双方代表团定期会晤，商谈有关停战协定的实施问题以及停战协定签字前的各种准备工作。这次商谈的结果如何，无疑地是全世界各国政府和人民所密切关怀的。
    究竟这次商谈会有什么样的结果，这是要由事实去做判断的。而目前的一切事实都已经非常清楚地表明：美国方面能否切实负起自己的责任，保证停战协定得到确实遵守与执行，乃是朝鲜停战能否实现的唯一关键。正如金日成元帅和彭德怀将军在答复克拉克的信中所说的：“我方认为，你方对于南朝鲜政府和军队在遵守停战协定及其一切有关协议上必须采取有效步骤，方能保证朝鲜停战不受破坏。”虽然，克拉克的来信也曾声明，“遇有必要之处，联合国军将尽其所能建立军事上的防卫措施，以保证停战条款将被遵守。”这种保证是完全必要的，因而也是我们所要求的。也正因为美方提供了这样的保证，我方才同意双方代表团继续商谈。但是，克拉克的来信是不能完全令人满意的，因为他在许多重要问题上还没有提供确切有效的保证。因此，人们决不应该过早地对于美方的所谓“保证”作过于乐观的看法。我方在复信中已经向美方指出：“你方对于南朝鲜政府和军队遵守双方代表团所达成的停战协定的保证，表示尚无确实把握。”这就说明美方的所谓“保证”是很不可靠的。
    有一个根本的事实使人不能相信美方的“保证”是可靠的。这就是美国政府不但至今还没有放弃对李承晚的纵容政策，而且还正在日益使李承晚的破坏行为受到鼓励。美国政府目前的政策据说是要“说服”李承晚集团接受停战；美国国务院的高级官员们也向它的“盟国”表示，“说服李承晚接受停战的方法还很多”。可是，美国总统的特使罗伯逊在汉城与李承晚进行的旷日持久的谈判证明，美国政府的所谓“说服”政策，不但没有能够说服李承晚接受停战，反而鼓励了李承晚集团更加蛮横地破坏停战的实现。罗伯逊到南朝鲜的第三天，就答应和李承晚集团订立一个“军事同盟”。现在，据美国通讯社透露，罗伯逊又向李承晚提出了一个什么“妙计”，答应李承晚如果停战后的政治会议在九十天内对和平统一朝鲜问题的讨论没有进展，美国就要和李承晚集团一道退出政治会议；这时，美国并愿意通过外交途径，和李承晚集团“讨论恢复战争”。美国共和党参议员诺兰一再公开宣称，即使李承晚一旦采取“单独干”的行动，美国政府也不能断绝对李承晚的装备和供应上的援助。这似乎是说：美国将继续供给李承晚以军火，让李承晚集团“单独打下去”。试问这样的“说服”办法其结果究竟是保证停战，还是保证破坏停战？明眼人岂不是一望而知。
    同样的事实在朝鲜美军的行动上表现出来的，就是克拉克司令部一贯缺乏实现他自己所提供的“保证”条件的认真努力。从克拉克六月二十九日来信提出“保证”到现在已经过去十天了，可是南朝鲜所发生的混乱情况不仅没有澄清，反而进一步地发展了。就以克拉克来信中所提出的关于战俘的事例来说，他一面保证：“联合国军正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘”；一面又说：“要把这些战俘全部追回……是不可能的”，“因为他们已经消失在居民中，而这些居民是有意庇护与保护他们的。”但据美国通讯社的报道说明，这些战俘还公开逗留在釜山等地，“坐着大卡车，经过釜山大街”，被运送到釜山附近李伪军的补充站去。美国通讯社的报道还说明，许多战俘“愿意回到联军这里来”，南朝鲜的“人民实在穷得没法”，“懒得维持被释放的战俘的生活”。这就可见克拉克是没有认真实行他的“保证”的。克拉克的司令部如果不改变他的这种态度，那末，所谓朝鲜停战的“保证”，当然就没有可靠的根据了。
    最使人不能相信美方的“保证”的可靠性的事实，就是李承晚集团直接破坏朝鲜停战的行为正在有加无已。李承晚在六月十八日大规模强迫扣留战俘以来，不仅没有丝毫悔祸之心，反而日益疯狂地叫嚣要用“武力统一朝鲜”。据美国通讯社透露，李承晚集团已经制订了一个破坏朝鲜停战的新的阴谋计划。这个计划企图进一步“释放”那些仍留在美方战俘营的朝鲜战俘，以继续阻碍签订停战协定，并准备拒绝把南朝鲜军队从前线撤退，以破坏非军事区的建立；同时它正加紧勾结蒋介石特务，企图强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员；并威胁着要用武力来反对印度部队到南朝鲜去执行中立国遣返委员会看管战俘的任务。近日来在南朝鲜发生的事实表明，李承晚的这个阴谋计划正在继续进行。对于李承晚集团这样疯狂破坏停战的活动，如果不能有效地加以制止，那末，美方所谓停战的“保证”就显然是不可靠的。
    什么是实现朝鲜停战的可靠的“保证”呢？它不仅是口头的保证，书面的保证，而更重要的是实际行动的保证。现在，美方如果愿意使朝鲜停战早日实现，就必须做出使人相信他的“保证”是确实可靠的实际行动来。这就是要美方采取实际行动，切实负责处理李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘的事件。按照金日成元帅和彭德怀将军在给克拉克的复信中所指出的，美国一方面“对于这次‘在逃’的战俘，在任何时候，都负有全部追回的责任”；另一方面，对于李承晚企图继续劫走剩传闻八千多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员并勾结蒋介石特务企图胁迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员离开战俘营的阴谋，“必须负起绝对责任，保证这类事件不再发生”。这就是要美方采取实际行动，切实保证李承晚集团对停战协定所有条款全部能够遵守和执行，使停战协定生效之日，朝鲜前线全面停火，双方一切军队完全撤离军事分界线，建立非军事区。这就是要美方采取实际行动，切实保证中立国遣返委员会及印度武装部队和我方解释人员的安全，以免除李承晚集团的迫害。美方必须用这些实际行动来证明给全世界人民看，并使全世界人民深信它是有能力履行停战协定中所承担的义务的。
    目前全世界人民要求实现朝鲜停战的心情是极为迫切的。就在联合国，那些有军队在朝鲜参加美方作战的十六个国家政府的发言人，也在本月六日发表谈话，催促美方不顾李承晚集团的阻挠，迳自签订停战协定。美国政府究竟是继续纵容李承晚集团破坏停战呢？还是愿意确实保证停战的实现呢？现在应该是作出决定的时候了。我们朝中方面对于谋求朝鲜停战、谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的愿望，是在任何情况下都不会有所改变的，并将为此而继续进行不懈的努力。金日成元帅和彭德怀将军致克拉克的复信就表现了一个新的努力。我方的这种努力完全符合于全世界人民企求早日实现朝鲜停战的愿望。但是，我们必须再一次地着重指出：朝鲜停战能否实现的关键一直是，现在更加是在于美国的方面。
