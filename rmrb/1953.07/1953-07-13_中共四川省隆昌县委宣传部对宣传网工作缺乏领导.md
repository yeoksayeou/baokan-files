    CCP Longchang County Committee Propaganda Department, Sichuan Province, Lacks Leadership in Propaganda Network Work
    A letter from Liu Jiu, a correspondent in Longchang County, Sichuan Province: The Propaganda Department of the CCP Longchang County Committee lacks leadership in developing the propaganda network, and the county's propaganda work has long been in a state of drift. Most district and village Party organizations and propaganda work cadres have not seriously studied and understood the spirit of the Central Committee regarding the establishment of propaganda networks, mistakenly opposing propaganda work to the central tasks, believing that engaging in propaganda work is superfluous and will affect production. Therefore, in every central task, they put propaganda work aside and do not pay attention to promoting the central task through propaganda. Although some places have established propaganda network organizations, they are merely formalities. Party organizations lack regular and specific assistance and education for propagandists. Upper levels only pay attention when propaganda work is being urged, and then abandon it afterward. Many propagandists feel they "have no resources" and do not know how to carry out their work, and their morale is low. Lai Jiafu, a propagandist in Wangxiang Township, District Nine, complains that he should not have applied to be a propagandist. Propagandists in Yingxiang Township, because they do not receive assistance and do not study well themselves, can only read from the book when propagating the significance of the patriotic production increase competition movement to the masses; they cannot answer practical questions raised by the masses. Some propagandists themselves have only a superficial understanding of the policies and propagate them incorrectly, creating a very bad influence among the masses. The CCP Longchang County Committee Propaganda Department has long failed to pay attention to these problems in propaganda network work and find ways to solve them. In the past two years or more, Longchang County has only held one representative conference of propagandists, but this conference did not seriously summarize experiences and lessons or improve propaganda work.

### 中共四川省隆昌县委宣传部对宣传网工作缺乏领导

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中共四川省隆昌县委宣传部对宣传网工作缺乏领导
    四川省隆昌县通讯员刘九来信：中共隆昌县委宣传部对开展宣传网的工作缺乏领导，全县的宣传工作长期陷于自流状态。大部分区、村党的组织和宣传工作干部没有认真学习和领会中央关于建立宣传网的精神，错误地把宣传工作和中心工作对立起来，认为搞宣传工作是多余的，会影响生产。因此，在每项中心工作中都把宣传工作搁在一边，不注意通过宣传推动中心工作。有些地方虽然也建立了宣传网的组织，但都流于形式。党组织对宣传员缺乏经常、具体的帮助和教育，上级对宣传工作催的紧了就抓一把，事后就丢开不管。很多宣传员觉得自己“没本钱”而不知怎样进行工作，情绪低落。九区望城乡宣传员赖家富埋怨自己不该申请当宣传员。迎祥乡的宣传员因为得不到帮助，自己也没有很好的学习，在向群众宣传爱国增产竞赛运动的意义时只好照本宣读；群众提出一些实际问题他就答不上来了。还有些宣传员自己对政策一知半解，宣传时宣传错了，在群众中造成很不好的影响。对于宣传网工作中的这些问题，中共隆昌县委宣传部长期没有加以重视并设法解决。两年多以来，隆昌县仅开了一次宣传员代表大会，但这次会也没有认真总结出经验教训，改进宣传工作。
