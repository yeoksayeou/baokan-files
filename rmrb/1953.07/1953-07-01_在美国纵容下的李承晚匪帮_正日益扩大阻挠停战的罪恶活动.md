Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 30th: Special correspondent reports: Increasing signs indicate that Li Seung-man is increasingly expanding his criminal activities to obstruct the Korean armistice.

Eisenhower's special envoy, Robertson, has been active in Seoul for five days. He has remained silent about the details of his series of talks with Li Seung-man. However, news from Seoul has not increased the hope for achieving an armistice; on the contrary, it casts an increasingly dark shadow. Associated Press reporter in Seoul reported on the 30th, "Li Seung-man has been clamoring that 'we will fight alone' if the United Nations forces sign the current armistice agreement. There is no indication that he has changed his original intention."

Many sources reveal that Li Seung-man's plan to sabotage the armistice first involves demanding revisions to the current armistice agreement, which has already been agreed upon by the UN forces and the Korean-Chinese side and is only awaiting signature. These revisions include not only refraining from pursuing the "released" more than 27,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war but also demanding the continued forced detention of the remaining prisoners of war under the guise of "release"; stipulating that the political conference must reach a solution to the Korean unification issue that satisfies Li Seung-man within three months, otherwise the Korean armistice will be terminated, etc. Li Seung-man knows very well that the Korean-Chinese side will never agree to these unreasonable "revisions," and his aim is to undermine the realization of the armistice.

According to reporters from many American news agencies, Li Seung-man is also planning a series of actions to sabotage the armistice, including: (1) invading Panmunjom and the Kaesong neutral zone; (2) refusing to withdraw South Korean troops from the demilitarized zone; (3) South Korean troops continuing to fight after the armistice; (4) obstructing the transfer of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; (5) attacking Indian troops who will be sent to South Korea to carry out the duties of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; (6) assassinating Korean-Chinese personnel who will go to South Korea to explain the situation to prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. Some reports even say that the Li Seung-man gang is clamoring for a plan to continue the war to ensure "winning the war." The first step of the plan is for South Korean troops to defend the front line, while the U.S. Air Force cuts off the supply lines of the Korean-Chinese troops in the narrow waist of North Korea; the second step is for South Korean troops to conduct a landing operation on the east coast south of Wonsan; the third step is to use 250 atomic bombs... Li Seung-man has obviously not given up on his plan of "unifying Korea by force," which he started three years ago under Dulles' planning and has now been beaten back to its original starting point, and is now still desperately making a last-ditch struggle. The reason why Li Seung-man dares to do this is because Eisenhower has promised to conclude a U.S.-South Korea military alliance with him, and one of the contents of Robertson's five days of talks with Li Seung-man is to conclude a temporary agreement with Li Seung-man to reach a preliminary agreement on this military alliance.

The U.S. government is aware of all these plans of Li Seung-man to sabotage the armistice. However, to date, although the U.S. government has repeatedly said that they "hope for an armistice," none of its responsible officials has come forward to announce his opposition to these plans. Moreover, whether it is Eisenhower, Dulles, or Robertson, they have repeatedly promised to conclude a U.S.-South Korea "mutual defense treaty." Thus, people can only believe that Li Seung-man's increasingly arrogant and crazy demands and plans to sabotage the armistice are the inevitable result of the U.S. policy of appeasement.

Robertson's talks with Li Seung-man in Seoul are still taking place again and again. World public opinion is watching these dangerous talks with vigilance, and there is every reason to do so.

### 在美国纵容下的李承晚匪帮  正日益扩大阻挠停战的罪恶活动

    在美国纵容下的李承晚匪帮
    正日益扩大阻挠停战的罪恶活动
    【新华社开城三十日电】本社特派记者报道：越来越多的迹象表明：李承晚正日益扩大他进行阻挠朝鲜停战的罪恶活动。
    艾森豪威尔的特使罗伯逊在汉城活动已有五天了，他对他和李承晚的一连串会谈的情况一直保持缄默，但是，从汉城来的消息不但没有增加实现停战的希望，反而投下越来越浓的阴影。美联社记者汉城三十日报道说：“李承晚一直嚷着说：如果联合国军签订目前的停战协定，‘我们一定单独打下去’。现在没有迹象可以看出他已改变初衷。”
    许多消息透露，李承晚破坏停战实现的计划首先是要求修改已经联合国军方面和朝中方面同意而只待签字的目前的停战协定，其中包括不仅要不追究已“被释放的”二万七千多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，而且还要求继续以“释放”名义强迫扣留剩下的战俘；规定政治会议要在三个月内就朝鲜统一问题取得使李承晚满意的解决办法，否则朝鲜停战即行废止，等等。李承晚明知朝中方面绝对不会同意这些无理的“修改”，他的目的是破坏停战的实现。
    据许多美国通讯社的记者透露，李承晚还计划一系列的破坏停战实现的行动，其中包括：（一）进犯板门店和开城中立区；（二）拒绝把南朝鲜军队撤离非军事区；（三）停战后南朝鲜部队仍继续作战；（四）阻挠将不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会；（五）袭击将要到南朝鲜执行中立国遣返委员会职务的印度部队；（六）暗杀将要到南朝鲜去向不直接遣返的战俘进行解释工作的朝中人员。有的消息还说，李承晚匪帮正在叫嚣继续作战的计划，以保证“赢得战争”，计划的第一步是由南朝鲜部队守住战线，同时由美国空军在北朝鲜狭腰地带切断朝中军队的供应线；第二步是由南朝鲜部队在元山以南的东海岸进行登陆作战；第三步是使用二百五十枚原子弹……。李承晚对于他三年前在杜勒斯策划下开始的而现在已被打回到原来的出发点的“武力统一朝鲜”的计划显然没有死心，现在仍要孤注一掷地作绝望的挣扎。李承晚所以敢于这样做，是因为艾森豪威尔已答应与他订立一个美李军事同盟，而罗伯逊五天来和李承晚会谈的内容之一就是跟李承晚订立一个临时协定来使这个军事同盟得到初步的协议。
    李承晚所有这些破坏停战实现的计划，都是美国政府知道的。然而，迄今为止，美国政府尽管一次又一次地说他们“希望停战”，它的所有负责官员却没有一个出面宣布过他反对这些计划，而且，不论艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯或罗伯逊，还一再答应订立美李“共同防御条约”。这样，人们只能认为李承晚越来越嚣张的旨在破坏停战的疯狂要求和计划是美国的纵容政策的必然结果。
    罗伯逊和李承晚在汉城的会谈仍在一次又一次地进行。全世界舆论警惕地注视着这些危险的会谈是完全有理由的。
