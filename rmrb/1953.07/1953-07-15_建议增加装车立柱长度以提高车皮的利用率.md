    Suggestion to Increase the Length of Loading Posts
    To Improve the Utilization Rate of Railway Wagons
    Readers Cui Mengyun, Chen Xuetian, and Chen Yuanguo wrote: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, in order to rationally use railway wagons, strive for more loading to ensure the supply of materials, promulgated in April this year the "Regulations on Raising and Widening the Loading of Goods Transported by Open Wagons." We believe this regulation is very good. Just taking the loading of timber as an example, the original stipulated height was 3.8 meters, and the newly stipulated height is 4.3 meters. Increasing the loading height of each wagon by 50 centimeters can load an additional 4 cubic meters. If the Northeast region transports a minimum of 1,000 wagons of timber per day, it can save 148 wagons. If we accumulate the annual timber transportation figures nationwide, the savings will be even more considerable. However, the timber loaded by various lumberyards in the Northeast forest area has not yet been loaded according to the newly stipulated height, mainly because the length of the wagon posts made by the forestry industry department in the past is insufficient, only 2.6 to 2.8 meters. After the Ministry of Railways issued the new regulations on raising and widening, they did not try to increase the length of the wagon posts, which directly affects the utilization of wagons and also hinders the timely supply of building materials to various places. Therefore, we suggest: The forestry industry department should manufacture wagon posts with a length of 3.1 meters as soon as possible; the previous wagon posts can be used on coal hopper wagons without lever eyes.

### 建议增加装车立柱长度以提高车皮的利用率

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建议增加装车立柱长度
    以提高车皮的利用率
    读者崔梦云、陈学田、陈元国来信：中央人民政府铁道部为了合理使用车皮，争取多装以保证物资供应，于今年四月颁布了“用无盖车装运货物放高放宽的规定”。这一规定我们认为很好。只说装运木材一项，原来规定的高度为三点八公尺，新规定的为四点三公尺，每个车皮装车高度提高五十公分，就可多装四立方公尺。东北地区每天最低以运输木材一千车计算，就可节省一百四十八个车皮。如果把全国每年的木材运输数字累计起来，节约数字更为可观。但现在东北林区各楞场装运的木材，到现在还没有按照新规定的高度装载，主要原因是森林工业部门过去作的车皮立柱长度不足，只有二点六至二点八公尺。铁道部放高放宽的新规定颁布后，他们并没有设法增加车皮立柱的长度，这样就直接影响了车皮运用，也妨碍了各地建筑器材的及时供应。因此，我们建议：森林工业部门应尽速制造长度三点一公尺的车立柱；以前的车立柱可利用在无杠眼的煤斗车上。
