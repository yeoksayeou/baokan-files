Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Many production factories and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, based on discussions of the national plan, have universally launched work to strengthen planning management. In carrying out this work, many units, due to the conscientious formulation and implementation of operational plans, have initially changed the past situation of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end of production, and have gradually achieved the requirement of completing production plans on a monthly, ten-day, or daily basis. This has prepared favorable conditions for further improving the management level of enterprises.

In the process of strengthening planning management, various factories and mines generally start by rectifying original records and formulating advanced quotas, compiling operational plans, and formulating practical technical organizational measures plans based on the weak links in enterprise management. Therefore, general operational plans can achieve good results in implementation. After the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production factories and mines discussed this year's production plan and universally formulated advanced operational plans, after two months of conscientious implementation, the production balance rate of many units has been greatly improved. The Iron Smelting Plant could only complete plans on a ten-day basis in the past, but since June, it has been able to complete the daily plan every day. The Steel Smelting Plant only achieved 40 percent in steel grade production in May, but this increased to 52.3 percent in June. After the implementation of the operational plan, the output, quality, and operation rate of various products have been significantly improved. The Iron Smelting Plant overfulfilled its plan by 15.1 percent in the first half of June. The proportion of pig iron for smelting high-quality steel increased from 90 percent stipulated in the national plan to 96.6 percent. The operating rates of the Steel Pipe Plant and Thin Plate Plant have also increased by more than 3 percent. When the Chongqing 101 Iron and Steel Plant rectified operational plans in key workshops in April, it formed three working groups, focusing on the first workshop, the third workshop, and the transportation section, to solve key production problems. The main reason why the first workshop's operational plan could not be implemented in the past was that there was no dedicated system for maintenance. Temporary shutdowns for machine accidents often disrupted production plans. Therefore, when rectifying the operational plan, they first established a dedicated system for maintenance work and planned to establish machine equipment maintenance regulations and spare parts reserve quotas, and adjusted the labor organization of maintenance work to ensure that maintenance work could be carried out according to the operational plan. The third workshop also adopted the method of compiling operational plans in three shifts, establishing original records in the main work sections, and strengthening the connection between the cupola furnace, the converter, and the open hearth furnace, so that the production between the various processes gradually achieved balance. In strengthening planning management, the Shenyang Smelting Plant, aiming at the situation where the actual recovery rate of copper, lead, and zinc did not meet the national stipulated indicators, organized technical personnel to conduct technical measurements from top to bottom, and mobilized workers to study and improve from a technical point of view. Based on the workers' operating experience, operating procedures were formulated, so the actual recovery rate of copper and zinc quickly reached the national stipulated indicators, and the actual recovery rate of lead also improved considerably. Based on mobilizing the masses of employees to discuss the national plan, the Northeast First Cement Plant, due to the timely compilation of monthly, ten-day, and daily operational plans for the plant, workshops, and teams, and the establishment of technical improvement measures to ensure the completion of operational plans, has been completing the plan evenly and exceeding the target every month from January to May this year. By June 7, the plant had completed the first half of the year's national production plan 23 days ahead of schedule. After the Tangshan Steel Plant further implemented the operational plan, the production situation is improving day by day. The production balance rate of the Steel Smelting Department has increased from 95.5 percent in April to 97.7 percent in May. In May, the quantity, quality, and raw material consumption of various main products generally reached the planned targets.

After many factories and mines compiled practical and feasible operational plans, they also paid attention to establishing and strengthening the dispatching work for directing production, so that the leading departments of the factories and mines could promptly discover and solve some major problems occurring in the production of each workshop, and could strengthen the inspection and supervision of on-site production through the dispatching organization. Although the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had a dispatching organization in the past, the dispatching work actually became a formality due to the lack of a scientific working system. When formulating the operational plan in May, the plant first enriched the organization of the dispatching work, established dispatching groups in each workshop, equipped the entire plant with 86 dispatchers, installed 27 dedicated dispatching telephones, and established responsibility systems such as handover, reporting, dispatchers going to workshops, work sections, and groups to check the implementation of operational plans. This played a great role in ensuring the implementation of the operational plan. The workers said: "Problems that could not be solved in the past in three days are now solved in three hours." While strengthening the operational plan, the Tangshan Steel Plant also enriched the dispatching organization, established a general dispatching office, equipped personnel familiar with production to serve as dispatchers, and established a production dispatching responsibility system. Therefore, many weak links found in production can be promptly solved through the dispatching organization. For example, in April, a furnace in the Steel Smelting Department needed major repairs. In order not to affect the normal production of other furnaces, the dispatchers held a meeting in advance to study effective measures to shorten the furnace repair time, ensuring the timely completion of production tasks. The small rolling mill of the first branch of Tianjin Steel Plant did not complete the steel operational plan in the first ten days of June. After the workshop dispatcher discovered this situation, he immediately reported it to the leadership. After research and analysis, the measures proposed by the workers were implemented, such as modifying the groove holes, improving the bearing bushes, and reducing the motor heat load. By the middle of June, the output of steel had reached the planned output, and the quality qualification rate had also increased from 98.65 percent in the first ten days of June to 99.68 percent.

    重工业部所属厂矿加强计划管理
    初步提高了生产均衡率
    逐渐达到按月按旬按日完成计划的要求
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府重工业部所属许多生产厂矿在讨论国家计划的基础上，普遍展开了加强计划管理的工作。在开展这一工作中，不少单位由于认真制订和贯彻了作业计划，已初步改变了过去生产中前松后紧的状况，并逐渐达到按月、按旬或按日完成生产计划的要求。这就为进一步提高企业的管理水平，准备了有利条件。
    各厂矿在加强计划管理工作的过程中，一般都是先从整顿原始记录和制订先进定额着手，编制作业计划，并根据企业管理方面的薄弱环节，订出切实可行的技术组织措施计划，因此，一般作业计划在贯彻执行中，都能收到良好的效果。鞍山钢铁公司所属生产厂矿在讨论今年生产计划的基础上，普遍制订出先进的作业计划后，经过两个月来的认真贯彻，不少单位的生产均衡率已大大提高。炼铁厂过去只能按旬完成计划，六月份以来每天都能完成日计划；炼钢厂在按钢种出钢方面，五月份只做到百分之四十，六月份增加到百分之五十二点三。贯彻作业计划后，各种产品的产量、质量和作业率，都有了显著的提高。炼铁厂六月份上半月超额百分之十五点一完成了计划；炼优质钢的生铁由国家计划规定的百分之九十，提高到了百分之九十六点六。钢管厂和薄板厂的作业率也提高了百分之三以上。重庆一零一钢铁厂四月份在重点车间整顿作业计划时，曾组成三个工作小组，分别以一场、三场和运输科为重点，解决生产中的关键问题。第一场过去作业计划不能贯彻，主要原因是检修没有专责制度，机器发生事故时临时停工检修，经常打乱生产计划。因此，在整顿作业计划时，他们就首先建立了检修工作的专责制，并计划订立机器设备保养规程与配件储备定额，调整检修工作的劳动组织，以保证检修工作能按照作业计划进行。第三场也采取分三班编制作业计划的办法，在各主要工段建立原始记录，加强化铁炉、吹炉和平炉之间的联系，使各工序间的生产逐渐达到了平衡。沈阳冶炼厂在加强计划管理工作中，针对铜、铅和锌的实收率达不到国家规定指标的情况，一面组织技术人员自上而下地进行技术测定；一面发动工人从技术上研究改进，根据工人的操作经验制订了操作规程，因此铜和锌的实收率很快就达到了国家规定的指标，铅的实收率也有相当提高。东北第一水泥厂在发动职工群众讨论国家计划的基础上，由于及时地编制出厂的、车间和小组的月、旬和日的作业计划，订立了保证完成作业计划的技术改进措施，因而今年一月到五月，每月都均衡地超额完成计划。到六月七日，该厂已提前二十三天完成了上半年的国家生产计划。唐山钢厂进一步贯彻作业计划后，生产情况日趋好转。炼钢部的生产均衡率已由四月份的百分之九十五点五提高到五月份的百分之九十七点七；五月份各种主要产品的数量、质量和原材料的消耗，一般都达到了计划指标。
    许多厂矿在编制出切实可行的作业计划后，也都注意建立和加强了指挥生产的调度工作，使厂矿的领导部门，能够及时发现和解决各车间生产中发生的一些重大问题，并能通过调度机构，加强对现场生产的检查和监督工作。太原钢铁厂过去虽然有调度机构，但由于缺少科学的工作制度，调度工作实际上流于形式。该厂五月份制订作业计划时，首先充实了调度工作的组织，各车间设立了调度组，全厂配备了八十六个调度员，安装了二十七部专用调度电话，并建立了交接班、汇报、调度员到车间、工段和小组检查作业计划执行情况等责任制度。对于保证作业计划的贯彻实现，起了很大作用。工人们说：“过去三天解决不了的问题，现在三小时内就解决了。”唐山钢厂在加强作业计划的同时，也充实了调度机构，成立了总调度室，配备对生产熟悉的人员担任调度员，并建立了生产调度责任制度。因此，生产中发现的许多薄弱环节，都能通过调度机构及时加以解决。如炼钢部四月份有个炉子需要大修，为了不影响其他炉子的正常生产，调度员们事先就开会研究出缩短修炉时间的有效措施，保证了生产任务的按期完成。天津钢厂一分厂小型轧钢场六月上旬没有完成钢材的作业计划，车间调度员发现这个情况后，立刻向领导方面反映，经过研究分析，实行了工人们提出的修正槽孔、改善轴瓦和减少马达热负荷等措施，到六月中旬，钢材的产量就达到了计划产量，质量合格率也由六月上旬的百分之九十八点六五，提高到百分之九十九点六八。
