Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th (TASS dispatch): A correspondent for the "Wall Street Journal" in Paris, Warren Phillips, published an article commenting on anti-American sentiment in Western Europe.

Phillips stated in the article: "On the streets of France, one can see slogans such as 'Americans Go Home!' everywhere, and, 'What is even more disturbing is that non-Communists in France do not want to erase them. Europeans rarely rise in words or deeds to defend the United States against the many who attack it. This is the mildest expression of the growing anti-American sentiment everywhere, from Scotland to southern Italy. More symbolically prominent are the distortions and misrepresentations of the United States that frequently appear in European newspapers and in conversations with ordinary non-Communists.'"

Phillips said: "A large proportion of Europeans believe that Senator McCarthy is not only a representative of Americans but actually rules the United States. In addition, news about congressional investigations, book burnings, and deportations in the United States has received widespread attention in the non-Communist press in Europe."

Phillips continued: "For many Europeans, American foreign policy is as repulsive as American domestic measures. The main accusation is that the United States is too tough and rigid in its compromising actions against Russia... It is widely believed in Europe that the United States refuses to negotiate with Russia or ease East-West tensions."

The author quoted a British journalist as saying: "Throughout Europe, people are talking about American practices, criticizing its more rigid policies toward the Soviet Union, and its own increased protectionism, etc."

The author went on to say: "Other aspects of American policy that Europeans frequently criticize are: the United States' refusal to promote peace in Asia by recognizing the New China and accepting its entry into the United Nations and handing Taiwan over to it; the United States' refusal to lower tariff barriers; the United States' pressure on its allies to continue massive arms programs and to stop East-West trade that could save dollars and increase employment opportunities; and the influence and interference of the United States in the foreign and domestic affairs of other countries."

Phillips pointed out: "It cannot be assumed that anti-Americanism is the result of Communist propaganda or stems from so-called lack of understanding of the United States." He analyzed that the fundamental reason for the rise of anti-American sentiment is the unequal relationship between the United States and Western European countries after the war. He said: "It cannot be expected that they (Europeans) will feel happy that they cannot control their own destiny of war or peace. Due to injured self-esteem and frustration, countries such as France and Britain naturally resent the United States—a country that has replaced them as world leader, whose policies are sufficient to determine their fate."

The author said: "Europeans' self-esteem is doubly hurt when they determine that their governments have traded independence in foreign and domestic policies for American aid. An Italian salesman—who is certainly not a Communist—said: 'Everyone knows that the Americans rule Italy, and Gasperi is under Washington's thumb... The Americans are only giving us aid for military reasons. They want our army.' All these frustrations, feelings of inferiority, powerlessness, and trampled self-esteem add up to the growth of anti-Americanism."

The author concluded: "Anti-Americanism is still worsening. This general sentiment is influencing European political development and will have an even greater impact in the future."

Phillips finally mentioned the fact that the position of pro-American politicians in Western Europe is being shaken. He said: "European leaders who are closely related to American policy are now facing a choice: either be ousted by their own people or adopt policies that are actually in line with their domestic public opinion. Whichever path they choose, the ultimate result will be greater opposition to American leadership—or finally a complete rejection of American leadership."

### “华尔街日报”驻巴黎记者承认  西欧反美情绪增涨

    “华尔街日报”驻巴黎记者承认
     西欧反美情绪增涨
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：“华尔街日报”驻巴黎记者华伦·菲利普斯发表了一篇文章，评西欧的反美情绪。
    菲利普斯在文章里说：在法国的街道上，到处可以看到“美国人滚回去！”一类的标语口号，而且，“使人感到更不安的是：法国的非共产党人也并不想把它们擦掉。欧洲人在言行中很少起来卫护美国，对付许多抨击它的人。这是从苏格兰到南意大利，到处都在增长的反美情绪的最和缓的表现。更突出地带有象征性的，是欧洲报纸上以及与普通非共产党人的谈话中经常出现的对美国的歪曲与曲解。”
    菲利普斯说：很大一部分欧洲人认为美国参议员麦卡锡不仅是美国人的代表，而且实际上统治着美国，此外，美国的国会调查，焚书和驱逐出境之类的新闻，都受到欧洲非共产党的报纸的广泛注意。
    菲利普斯接着说：“对于许多欧洲人说来，美国外交政策像美国的内政措施一样都是令人厌恶的。最主要的责难是：美国在对付俄国的妥协性行动时是太强硬太死板了……欧洲广泛地相信：美国不肯与俄国协商或缓和东西方局势。”
    作者引一个英国新闻记者的话指出：在全欧洲，人们都议论美国的作法，批评它对苏联进行更僵硬的政策以及自己加强保护主义等等。
    作者接着说：欧洲人所经常抨击的美国政策的其他方面是：美国拒绝用承认新中国和接受它入联合国并把台湾交给它的办法来促进亚洲的和平；美国拒绝降低关税壁垒；美国压迫其盟国继续庞大的军备计划，并停止可以节省美元和增加就业机会的东西方贸易；以及美国对其他国家外交和内政方面的影响和干涉。
    菲利普斯指出：不能认为，反美主义是共产党宣传的结果或是出于所谓不了解美国。他分析，反美情绪高涨的根本原因，是战后美国和西欧国家之间不平等的关系。他说：“决不能要求他们（欧洲人）感到自己不能掌握自己的战争或和平的命运还感到愉快。由于自尊心受伤害和遭受挫折，例如法国和英国，就自然而然怨恨美国——一个代替它们成为世界领导者的国家，其政策足以决定它们的命运的国家。”
    作者说：欧洲人“在认定他们的政府以出卖外交内政政策的独立来换取美援以后，他们的自尊心就加倍地受到伤害。一个意大利推销商人——他当然不是共产党——说：‘每个人都知道美国人统治着意大利，加斯贝利是在华盛顿的大拇指底下的。……美国不过是为了军事原因而给我们援助。他们要我们的军队。’所有这些挫折、自卑、无能为力的感觉和被践踏的自尊心加在一起，就使得反美主义滋长起来。”
    作者总结写道：“反美主义还在恶化。这一普遍的情绪对欧洲政治发展正在发生影响并且在将来还会发生更大的影响。”
    菲利普斯最后谈到西欧亲美的政治家地位动摇的事实，他说：“与美国政策有密切关系的欧洲领袖们，现在正面临着这样一个选择：不是被他们自己的人民赶下台来，就是采取与他们国内公众舆论的实际相适合的政策。不管他们选择那一条路，最终的结果会是更加反对美国的领导——或者终于完全拒绝美国的领导。”
