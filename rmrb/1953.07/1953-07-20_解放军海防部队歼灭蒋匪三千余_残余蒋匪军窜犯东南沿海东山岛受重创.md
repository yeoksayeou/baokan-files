Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 19th: The People's Liberation Army unit, vigilantly guarding the southeast coast, annihilated over three thousand Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit troops who had invaded Dongshan Island (located between Fujian and Guangdong, belonging to Fujian Province).

　　At 5:00 AM on July 16th, the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in Taiwan and Kinmen Islands mustered over ten thousand people, and under the cover of aircraft and warships, invaded Dongshan Island. Simultaneously, over two hundred bandit paratroopers landed in northern Dongshan. The powerful People's Liberation Army was well prepared and immediately launched an encirclement and suppression campaign against the landed bandits. The militia and the masses on the island also fiercely struck the enemy. By the afternoon of the same day, the insignificant bandit paratroopers were completely annihilated. The People's Liberation Army then swept through the area in several routes, causing heavy casualties to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who fled in panic. By 7:00 PM on July 17th, the battle ended victoriously.

　　In this battle, a total of three thousand three hundred and seventy-nine remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated, including two thousand six hundred and sixty-four bandits killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fifteen bandits captured. Three small bandit landing craft were sunk, two enemy aircraft were shot down, and one hundred and nine light and heavy machine guns, two recoilless rifles, twenty-six 60mm mortars, eighteen rocket launchers, and a large quantity of firearms, ammunition, and military supplies were seized. This intrusion was a long-prepared move by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The bandit troops were painstakingly trained by US imperialism and equipped with weapons shipped from the United States. However, in the face of the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people, this intrusion was swiftly extinguished.

    解放军海防部队歼灭蒋匪三千余
    残余蒋匪军窜犯东南沿海东山岛受重创
    【新华社福州十九日电】警惕地保卫着东南沿海的中国人民解放军某部歼灭了窜犯东山岛（在福建和广东之间，属福建省）的蒋介石残余匪军三千多名。
    七月十六日上午五时，盘踞台湾和金门岛的残余蒋匪拼凑了一万多人，在飞机和兵舰的掩护下窜犯东山岛，同时匪伞兵二百多人在东山北部降落。强大的人民解放军早有准备，立即对登陆残匪展开围剿，岛上的民兵和群众也狠狠地打击敌人。当日下午就把蒋匪微不足道的伞兵全部消灭了。人民解放军随即纷纷分路扫荡，蒋匪伤亡惨重，慌忙溃退。至十七日下午七时，战斗胜利结束。
    这次战斗，共歼灭残余蒋匪三千三百七十九名，其中打死打伤匪二千六百六十四人，俘掳匪七百十五名，击沉匪小型登陆艇三艘，击落敌机二架，缴获轻重机枪一百零九挺，无座力炮两门，六零炮二十六门，火箭筒十八个，还有大批枪枝弹药和军用物品。这次窜扰是蒋匪长期准备的，匪军都是经过美帝国主义苦心训练的，装备也是远从美国运来的，但是在强大的中国人民解放军和中国人民面前这一窜扰却迅速地被扑灭了。
