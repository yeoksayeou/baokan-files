Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 6th: Workers at the Rolling Mill Workshop of the Daye Steel Plant, a state-owned enterprise under the China Central Iron and Steel Corporation, have achieved success in promoting the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small Rolling Mill in mechanization and automation. In less than two months, technicians and workers throughout the workshop have put forward more than forty suggestions on mechanization and automation. Already successfully tested and implemented are automatic roller conveyors for transporting steel on the 10-inch rolling mill cooling bed, automated steel shearing on the 17-inch rolling mill, automatic typesetting on the 12-inch rolling mill, and the rolling mill "surround panel" created based on the workshop's equipment. These improvements have greatly increased the machine operating rate in the workshop and reduced the physical labor of rolling mill workers under high temperatures. With the development of the movement, the rolling mill workshop completed its semiannual production plan ten days ahead of schedule this year. Workers' labor productivity increased by 22.8 percent compared to last year, and the workshop cost per ton of steel material was reduced by more than 274,000 yuan compared to last year.

In the development of the movement, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Daye Steel Plant Rolling Mill Workshop branch played a guaranteeing role. When workers in the rolling mill workshop were discussing the national plan, the Party branch educated Party members to lead all the workshop's workers in learning from the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill and to launch a mechanization and automation movement to solve key problems in production. The Party branch fully utilized the Party's propaganda weapons and brought into play the strength of various organizational systems. At the beginning of the movement, it used forms such as big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and comic strips to systematically introduce the experience of the small rolling mill in mechanization and automation, and the story of Zhang Mingshan's struggle for mechanization and automation, putting forward slogans such as "Learn from Zhang Mingshan!" After the movement was launched, the Party branch used the Party's propaganda network and trade union organizations to turn the rationalization proposals put forward by the masses for improving equipment into drawings, and carried out figurative publicity among the workers, calling on everyone to use collective wisdom to enrich and modify them. Because the mechanization and automation movement initially solved key problems in production, the workshop workers' confidence in completing the national production plan was greatly strengthened, and they formulated an advanced plan to complete the task ahead of schedule in the discussion of the national plan.

    大冶钢厂轧钢车间
    推广机械化自动化经验
    提前十天完成半年生产计划并降低了成本
    【新华社武汉六日电】国营华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂轧钢车间职工，推广鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂机械化自动化运动的经验，已取得成绩。在不到两个月的时间内，全车间的技术人员和工人先后提出了四十多件关于机械化自动化的建议。已经试行成功的有十吋轧钢机冷床输送钢材的自动滚道、十七吋轧钢机的自动化剪钢、十二吋轧钢机的自动打字和根据车间设备情况创造的轧钢机“围盘”等。这些改进，已使车间的机器运转率大大提高，并减轻了轧钢工人在高温下的体力劳动。随着运动的开展，轧钢车间今年上半年的生产计划已经提前十天完成，工人的劳动生产率比去年提高了百分之二十二点八，每吨钢料的车间成本也比去年降低了二十七万四千多元。
    在运动开展中，中共大冶钢厂轧钢车间支部的领导起了保证作用。当轧钢车间职工在讨论国家计划时，党的支部就教育党员带动全车间的职工，学习鞍钢小型轧钢厂的经验，展开机械化自动化运动来解决生产上的关键问题。党支部充分地运用党的宣传武器和发挥各组织系统的力量。在运动开始时，采用大字报、黑板报、连环画等形式，系统地介绍了小型轧钢厂机械化自动化的经验和张明山为机械化自动化而斗争的故事，提出“向张明山学习！”等口号。运动展开以后，党支部又通过党的宣传网和工会组织，把群众提出的关于改善设备的合理化建议，画成图画，在职工中进行形象化的宣传，号召大家使用集体智慧予以充实和修改。由于机械化自动化运动初步解决了生产中的关键问题，车间职工完成国家生产计划的信心大为加强，从而在讨论国家计划中制订出了提前完成任务的先进计划。
