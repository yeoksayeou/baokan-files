In October 1950, disregarding the warnings of the Chinese people, the American invading army brazenly crossed the 38th parallel, extending the flames of war to the Yalu River and seriously threatening our country's security. To safeguard their homes and defend the country, the Chinese people voluntarily formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, crossed the Yalu River, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army to strike at the American invaders.

The first battle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army abroad—the Victory of Yunshan—fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, jointly annihilating more than 13,000 enemy troops, liberating large areas of land north of the Cheongcheon River, and crushing the enemy's arrogant plan to occupy the entire Korean Peninsula and advance on our country before "Thanksgiving."

In late November 1950, the American invaders concentrated their forces and launched the so-called "General Offensive to End the Korean War" on the eastern and western fronts. Our Chinese and Korean people's forces fought back valiantly, annihilating more than 30,000 enemy troops and winning the victory of the Second Campaign.

From May to October 1951, unwilling to accept defeat, the enemy launched the so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," adventurously attacking successively in the western and central parts of the Korean front. Our army dealt a heavy blow, annihilating more than 250,000 enemy troops. This is a scene of the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army meeting and celebrating their victory in a certain place. Xinhua News Agency Reporter, Qian Sijie

In the autumn of 1952, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which firmly defended the two highlands of the Shangganling area on the Kimhwa front in Korea, fought continuously for 46 days with the invading American invaders and the Lee Syngman puppet army, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 25,000 enemy troops, achieving a brilliant victory. These are the brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defending the Shangganling position, fiercely shooting at the invading enemy. Xinhua News Agency, Huang Songxiang
