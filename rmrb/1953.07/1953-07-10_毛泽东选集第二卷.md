    Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II
    Soviet Union, A. Sobolev, I. Precheski

    The Chinese Communist Party possesses rich and diverse experience in liberation struggles. Since its establishment, it has led numerous revolutionary battles, and in the course of these battles, the strength of the great Chinese people has become more united and tempered year by year. Under different historical conditions, in both low and high tides of the revolution, it has extensively employed various political and military, open and secret means and methods of struggle.

    The Chinese people's years of struggle and their great historical victory are outstanding contributions to the global liberation movement. The theoretical summary of the Chinese Communist Party's experience in leading the revolutionary movement is of great significance not only to Chinese comrades but also to all communists in countries under capitalist rule, especially to communists in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

    Comrade Mao Zedong, the organizer and leader of the Chinese Communist Party, provided profound Marxist-Leninist analyses of the Party's activities in his works, scientifically demonstrating the Party's policies and strategies under various historical conditions.

    The Foreign Languages Press has published the Russian edition of Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II. This volume includes works written within a relatively short period—from July 23, 1937, to November 6, 1938. During this period, the primary issue for all activities of the Chinese Communist Party was the organization of resistance against Japanese imperialism.

    The creative application of Marxist-Leninist theory enabled the Chinese Communist Party to formulate the correct political line for the War of Resistance Against Japan, put forward slogans suited to the needs of the time, and prescribe the paths and methods to defeat Japanese imperialism.

    I. The Program for Defeating Japanese Imperialism

    In July 1937, Japanese imperialism, dreaming of turning China into its colony, openly launched a war against China, launching a large-scale attack on the Chinese mainland. The aggression of Japanese imperialism brought about fundamental changes in the domestic historical situation. The Chinese people faced a grave crisis of national subjugation. At that time, Mao Zedong wrote: "Our nation is at a critical juncture of survival or extinction" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Chinese Edition, Volume II, page 330).

    The change in the historical situation required a reconsideration of the Party's political line and the adoption of new methods and means of struggle. In his works such as "The Orientation, Tasks and Future of the Anti-Japanese War," "For the Mobilization of All Forces to Win Victory in the War of Resistance," "The Urgent Tasks After the Establishment of the Kuomintang-Communist Cooperation," and "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," Mao Zedong theoretically demonstrated the political line of the Chinese Communist Party under the new circumstances.

    The Communist Party issued a call to the people of the whole country to organize resistance against the enemy, adopting the policy of waging a national revolutionary war by the whole people against Japan.

    Deeply aware of its historical responsibility for the destiny of the motherland and the people, the Communist Party resolutely and relentlessly opposed the pro-Japanese appeasement and concession policies of the traitors, isolating defeatists and other national traitors. It held high the banner of national independence, confidently raising this banner and advancing, demonstrating a clear example of true patriotism.

    In arguing that the working class and the Communist Party must actively participate in the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mao Zedong pointed out the organic unity between the patriotic and internationalist obligations undertaken by the Chinese proletariat, and the close link between the national and class tasks borne by the Chinese proletariat. He pointed out that striving for China's national independence was a necessary prerequisite for the Chinese people to strive for social and political progress; and that under the specific circumstances of Japanese aggression, the class struggle of the proletariat took the form of national liberation struggle.

    Mao Zedong pointed out: "We are internationalists, and we are also patriots. Our slogan is to fight to defend the motherland against aggressors. For us, defeatism is a crime, and striving for victory in the War of Resistance is an unshirkable responsibility. Because only by fighting to defend the motherland can we defeat the aggressors and liberate the nation. Only when the nation is liberated, can the proletariat and the working people be liberated." (Ibid., page 483)

    Based on a Marxist-Leninist analysis of the objective situation, the Communist Party temporarily abandoned the old strategic and tactical guidelines that were unsuitable for the historical circumstances at the time, replacing them with new ones that were entirely suitable for the task of launching a national revolutionary war at that time.

    When assessing the nature of the War of Resistance Against Japan as a national liberation war, the Communist Party first determined that its goal was to unite all the political and social forces of China under the banner of resistance against Japan.

    The Communist Party called on all sectors of society, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, to actively participate in the struggle to drive out the foreign invaders. Mao Zedong wrote: "The entire Chinese people must be mobilized, armed, and participate in the War of Resistance, contributing strength, money, guns, and knowledge." (Ibid., page 312)

    Mao Zedong pointed out in his works that the political line of the Communist Party was fundamentally different from the reactionary, anti-people political line of the then ruling Chiang Kai-shek government.

    Under the pressure of the broad strata of the Chinese people, and also because the interests of American and British imperialism in China, as well as the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, were significantly harmed by the Japanese aggression, Chiang Kai-shek had to show his willingness to resist Japan. However, this was more of a deceptive trick and a forced maneuver than a sincere willingness to resist the enslavers. The Kuomintang members were most afraid of the activism of the masses of the people, and the prospect of launching a war of resistance by the whole people filled them with great alarm. It was very clear that this stance of the Chiang Kai-shek group would inevitably lead the country to defeat and subject the Chinese people to enslavement.

    Contrary to the reactionary and traitorous policies adopted by Chiang Kai-shek, the Communist Party, in accordance with the demands of all patriotic elements in China, adopted a series of major measures in military, economic, political, and cultural fields to ensure the widespread launch of a war of resistance by the whole people, mobilizing the Chinese people to fight for national salvation.

    These measures stipulated: general mobilization of the entire people; arming the entire people; launching active combat against the enemy in the front lines; organizing guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines; democratizing state organs; reducing rent; improving the lives of workers and staff; popularizing national education; and resolutely eliminating domestic traitors and elements of capitulation and compromise.

    The establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front practically embodied the Communist Party's policy of vigorously launching the War of Resistance Against Japan and uniting the whole people. The necessity and strong vitality of the national united front have been confirmed by the past experience of the Chinese Communist Party and the experience of national liberation movements in various capitalist countries in Europe.

    In the struggle to establish the national united front, the Chinese Communist Party understood the reactionary nature of the Kuomintang, knew the anti-people nature of the Chiang Kai-shek government's policies, and was well aware that Chiang Kai-shek would certainly be insincere and engage in double-dealing tactics. However, the establishment of a national united front was a historical necessity and a condition for defeating the Japanese invaders. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly proposed to the Kuomintang to stop the civil war and form a united front between the two parties in order to jointly resist Japan.

    In a telegram to the Central Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in February 1937, the Communist Party put forward specific conditions for cooperation between the two parties, demanding that the Kuomintang completely stop the civil war, implement democracy and freedom, convene a national assembly, rapidly prepare for resistance against Japan, and improve the lives of the people. The Communist Party itself was also willing to implement a series of major measures to facilitate the establishment of the anti-Japanese united front.

    Under the high tide of the domestic patriotic movement, Chiang Kai-shek was finally forced to superficially agree to the establishment of a national united front. Mao Zedong wrote: "The united front now re-established between the two parties forms a new period in the Chinese revolution… The wheel of history will pass through this united front and bring the Chinese revolution to a new stage. Whether China can be liberated from such a deep national crisis and social crisis will depend on the development of this united front." (Ibid., page 323)

    The establishment of the united front proved that anti-Japanese cooperation among various social strata and parties had been established. Of course, all of this did not mean that the contradictions between the people and the Kuomintang government, the contradictions between peasants and landlords, and the contradictions between workers and the bourgeoisie had been eliminated. These contradictions could not be resolved until the invaders were defeated. On the other hand, the Communist Party did not give up resolving these contradictions.

    When assessing the demands of the situation, the Communist Party believed that its task was to correctly resolve the issue of the interrelationships between the various classes within the united front. The Communist Party demonstrated political flexibility and wisdom. It put forward new slogans and demands, the realization of which marked the further development of the country and strengthened the struggle against the enemy.

    In the political aspect, the Communist Party temporarily abandoned the demand for the establishment of a worker-peasant democratic dictatorship, and proposed the establishment of a democratic republic for people of all strata. It demanded changes in the domestic political system and the establishment of a new government, namely a government of a democratic republic. Mao Zedong pointed out when explaining the characteristics of this government: First, it must be an alliance of all classes that advocate resistance to Japan, which must include workers, peasants, and other strata of the petty bourgeoisie; second, it must be organized according to the principle of democratic centralism; third, it must give the people all necessary political freedoms.

    In the aspect of social relations, the Communist Party implemented the policy of reducing rent and interest and reasonable burdens in order to mobilize the strength of the peasants, while temporarily suspending the task of completing the land revolution. This was not because it was no longer necessary to solve such a crucial task, but in order to unite all the strength of the Chinese nation against Japanese imperialism. In the economic aspect, the Communist Party also put forward some measures to improve the lives of the people. These measures fully met the requirements of the situation and promoted the consolidation of the national united front.

    The Communist Party's clear and principled line on the issue of the national united front, its correct policies within the united front, and its tireless struggle to win the masses for the united front, turned the united front into a powerful weapon for the Chinese people's liberation struggle, ensuring that the Chinese people finally defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    II. Discussion of Military Theory Issues

    Military theory issues occupy a very important position in Volume II of Selected Works of Mao Zedong. These issues were of paramount importance to the Chinese Communist Party, because the outcome of the war determined the fate of China.

    In his works such as "On Protracted War," "Strategic Problems in the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War," and "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," Mao Zedong provided a Marxist-Leninist explanation of the nature of the War of Resistance Against Japan, scientifically analyzed the factors that guaranteed the eventual victory of the Chinese people, pointed out the strategic and tactical characteristics of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and brilliantly explained the significance of guerrilla warfare in the entire war.

    At that time, various parties and factions in China had different opinions on the future of the war and the attitude that should be taken towards the war.

    The right-wing upper echelons of the Kuomintang, especially the Wang Jingwei faction of traitors, determined that China would inevitably be defeated in the War of Resistance Against Japan. They said: China is an economically weak country, and China's weapons are inferior to those of Japan; therefore, "fighting again will lead to destruction." Those who held this view had already embarked on the path of compromise and selling out national interests.

    In addition, another view prevailed in China, namely, the theory of quick victory. Those who advocated quick victory fell into blind optimism, underestimated the enemy's strength, and embarked on the path of adventurism, which would inevitably lead China to failure.

    Ideologically shattering these two views was of utmost importance for the War of Resistance and the fate of the Chinese people. Mao Zedong creatively applied the Marxist-Leninist principles on the essence of war, exposed the anti-scientific, subjective idealist nature of these two views, and demonstrated the possibility of defeating the Japanese invaders.

    Those who advocated compromise and surrender tried to defend their position by asserting that the balance of power between China and Japan was unfavorable to China. They said that Japan was a small but strong country with a developed industry and a powerful army and navy equipped with modern weapons; while China was a weak country with a backward economy and poor weapons. Mao Zedong ruthlessly criticized this one-sided and mechanical view of the balance of power. He pointed out that the following factors now and in the future will affect the course of the war:

    First, Japan's war is an imperialist, reactionary, and unjust war, which weakens Japan's strength; in contrast, China's war is a revolutionary, progressive, and liberation war, which enhances China's strength.

    Second, although Japan is a strong country, due to its imperialist nature, it is heading towards decline; while China has embarked on the path of reform, it is rising like the sun and is in an era of progress.

    Mao Zedong pointed out that one of China's main strengths is that China is a large country with vast land, abundant resources, a large population, and many soldiers.

    International factors also have a great impact on the course of the war. The progressive nature of China's war enables it to receive increasing international assistance; while Japan's aggression will inevitably lead it to international isolation.

    Finally, the fundamental change in the historical situation is the primary factor. The war launched by the Japanese invaders is being waged in the era of the general crisis of capitalism, on the eve of the great collapse of world imperialism, and in a world that has already been divided into two systems and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated. Mao Zedong said: "In particular, the existence of the Soviet Union has inspired China's War of Resistance. The unprecedentedly powerful socialist Soviet Union and China have always been closely linked." (Ibid., page 418)

    Mao Zedong pointed out that the outcome of the war is not determined by incomplete fragments, but by the interaction of those large and small factors that are clearly favorable to China. This prediction has been confirmed.

    Mao Zedong also dealt a fatal blow to those who adhered to the "theory of weapons are everything." He pointed out that weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The balance of power is not only a comparison of military and economic power, but also a comparison of manpower and popular support." (Ibid., page 432)

    While demonstrating the various possibilities of China's victory, Mao Zedong emphasized that victory will not come automatically, but must be striven for through cruel struggle; the war will be protracted.

    Mao Zedong pointed out: "This protracted war will be specifically manifested in three stages. The first stage is the period of the enemy's strategic offensive and our strategic defense. The second stage is the period of the enemy's strategic stalemate and our preparation for counter-offensive. The third stage is the period of our strategic counter-offensive and the enemy's strategic retreat." (Ibid., page 425)

    The various works in Volume II comprehensively discuss the strategic and tactical issues of the war, and the issue of the changes in strategic and tactical guidelines with the changes in the strategic stage.

    Guerrilla warfare played a great role in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In summarizing the experience that had been accumulated, Mao Zedong raised the strategic issues of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War, pointing out: the significance of actively, flexibly, and plannedly executing offensive warfare in defensive warfare, and quick decisions in protracted warfare; the importance of the coordination between guerrilla warfare and regular warfare; the necessity of establishing base areas; the characteristics of the strategic defense and strategic offensive of guerrilla warfare; the development of guerrilla warfare towards the mobile warfare of regular troops; the necessity of strategic centralized command and tactical decentralized command of guerrilla warfare. He gave many important instructions on some tactical issues of guerrilla warfare. Mao Zedong's discussion of strategic and tactical issues is a major contribution to the theory of military art.

    The strategic and tactical principles for the War of Resistance Against Japan formulated by the Communist Party reflected the characteristics of the all-out revolutionary war of the people who were fighting against the oppression of foreign imperialism and for the realization of democratic revolution and democratic freedom. The Chinese Communist Party was the true leader and organizer of the people's war. It mobilized the masses of the people to participate in the War of Resistance, established the people's army, inspired the Chinese people's confidence in victory, and guided the Chinese people to a great victory.

    III. Struggle to Consolidate the Ranks of the Communist Party

    The works in Volume II pay great attention to the issue of consolidating the Communist Party organizationally and ideologically by all means, and raising the ideological level and combat effectiveness of the Party ranks. Mao Zedong's report "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War," his essay "Combat Liberalism" and the philosophical work "On Contradiction" are of particularly great significance for the consolidation of the Party.

    In order to consolidate its ranks and enhance its leading role in the liberation movement, the Party waged a struggle on two fronts against "Left" and Right opportunism, carefully protecting its ranks from the infiltration of hostile influences.

    Before the large-scale offensive of the Japanese army against China in 1937, the main danger within the Party was "Left" opportunism, that is, closed-doorism. It was dangerous, first of all, because it hindered the implementation of the Party's line of establishing the anti-Japanese national united front.

    The open aggression of Japan against China, the rapid penetration of the Japanese army into the Chinese mainland and the occupation of large cities, the Kuomintang group's policy of practical surrender, and the existence of a large number of petty-bourgeois elements within the Party, all made the right-leaning opportunists in the Party active, and they brought the mood of surrender and disbelief in victory into the Party's ranks. Under these circumstances, right-leaning opportunism, that is, capitulationism, became the main danger.

    Comrade Mao Zedong, with an irreconcilable spirit and a high degree of principle, raised the issue of eliminating opportunism, and the issue of opposing capitulationism within the Party and within the country, emphasizing the close connection between class capitulationism and national capitulationism.

    A sharp struggle was launched against right-leaning opportunists on the issue of the role of the Communist Party in the national united front. The right-leaning capitulationists put forward the slogan "Everything through the united front." The danger of this slogan was that it eliminated the Communist Party's independence and autonomy in the united front. At a time when the Kuomintang disregarded the equal rights of all parties and tried to force other parties to accept its leadership, this line actually meant that the Communist Party would obey the Kuomintang and surrender to the bourgeoisie.

    In the struggle, the Communist Party thoroughly defeated the right-leaning opportunists, defended its independence and autonomy in the united front, consolidated its ties with the masses, and its vanguard role in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and became the recognized leader of the national liberation movement.

    The Party established its leading role because it wholeheartedly served the people, implemented correct policies, and because of the heroic actions of its members on the front lines and in the rear. In order to consolidate and expand its leading role, the Party waged a resolute struggle to consolidate Party discipline and strengthen Party democracy. It tirelessly educated Party members to realize their sacred duty to serve the people.

    Mao Zedong wrote: "A Communist Party member should be open-minded, honest, active, take the interests of the revolution as his first life, and subordinate his personal interests to the interests of the revolution; at any time and in any place, adhere to correct principles and tirelessly struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors in order to consolidate the collective life of the Party, consolidate the Party's ties with the masses; care for the Party and the masses more than he cares for himself, and care for others more than he cares for himself. Only then can he be considered a Communist Party member." (Ibid., page 319)

    The Communist Party showed tireless concern for raising its theoretical cultivation and the ideological level of its members, and required leading cadres to constantly master Marxism-Leninism.

    The ideological education of cadres and all theoretical work of the Party were closely linked to practice and to solving the urgent problems in the struggle.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The great strength of Marxism-Leninism lies in its connection with the specific revolutionary practice of various countries. For the Chinese Communist Party, it means learning to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of China. Communist Party members who have become a part of the great Chinese nation and are flesh and blood with this nation, talking about Marxism without the characteristics of China is only abstract and empty Marxism." (Ibid., page 497)

    Mao Zedong waged a relentless struggle against all tendencies that violated Marxism-Leninism, resolutely criticized dogmatism and empiricism, and creatively applied theory to solve the urgent problems in the Chinese people's liberation struggle.

    The work "On Contradiction" is of great significance in the struggle against theoretical dogmatism and empiricism, and in the struggle against subjectivism in policy. This work provided a theoretical basis for the Party's policies and pointed out the harm of vulgarizing Marxism to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Mao Zedong's works are a profound theoretical summary of the Chinese revolution experience. These works further improved the ideological and theoretical level of the Chinese Communist Party, enhanced its combat effectiveness, and strengthened its leading role in the Chinese people's liberation struggle. These works enriched the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have victoriously completed the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, driven out all imperialists, overthrown the reactionary rule, established their own power, and are now selflessly building a new life.

    毛泽东选集第二卷
    苏联  阿·索波列夫  伊·普列歇夫斯基
    中国共产党拥有丰富而多方面的解放斗争经验。它自成立以来领导了许多次革命战斗，在这些战斗过程中一年比一年更加团结了和锻炼了伟大的中国人民的力量。它在不同的历史条件下，在革命低潮和高涨的情况下，广泛地运用了各种不同的政治的和军事的，公开的和秘密的斗争手段和斗争方式。
    中国人民的多年的斗争及其伟大的历史性胜利是对全世界解放运动的杰出贡献。中国共产党领导革命运动的经验的理论总结，不仅对于中国同志，而且对于一切处在资本统治下的国家的共产党员，特别是对于殖民地和半殖民地国家的共产党员，具有重大的意义。
    中国共产党的组织者和领袖毛泽东同志，在自己的著作中对于党的活动给了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，科学地论证了各种历史条件下党的政策和策略。
    外国书籍出版局出版了俄文版毛泽东选集第二卷。第二卷包括在较短的时期内——一九三七年七月二十三日至一九三八年十一月六日所写的著作。这一时期，中国共产党的全部活动的首要问题是组织反抗日本帝国主义的问题。
    创造性地应用马克思列宁主义的理论，使得中国共产党制定了抗日战争时期的正确的政治路线，提出了适合时局要求的口号，规定了战胜日本帝国主义的道路和方法。
    一、战胜日本帝国主义的纲领
    一九三七年七月，梦想变中国为其殖民地的日本帝国主义，公开向中国发动战争，大举进攻中国本部。日本帝国主义的侵略，使国内历史情况发生了根本的变化。中国人民面临着亡国的严重危机。当时，毛泽东写道：“我们民族已处在存亡绝续的关头”（毛泽东选集，中文版，第二卷，第三三○页）。
    历史情况的改变，要求重新考虑党的政治路线，采用新的斗争方式和方法。毛泽东在其“反对日本进攻的方针，办法和前途”，“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”，“国共合作成立后的迫切任务”及“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”等各篇著作中，从理论上论证了中国共产党在新的情况下的政治路线。
    共产党向全国人民发出了组织抗敌的号召，采取了开展抗日的全民的民族革命战争的方针。
    共产党因深感自己对于祖国和人民的命运所负的历史责任，坚决无情地反对了汉奸分子对日妥协、退让的政策，孤立了失败主义者及其他的民族叛徒。它高举起民族独立的旗帜，满怀信心地举起这面旗帜前进，显示出真正爱国主义的鲜明榜样。
    毛泽东在论证工人阶级和共产党必须积极参加抗日战争时，指明了中国无产阶级所承担的爱国主义义务和国际主义义务之间的有机统一，指明了中国无产阶级所负的民族任务和阶级任务之间的密切连系。他指明争取中国的民族独立，是中国人民力求社会进步和政治进步的必要先决条件；指明在日本侵略的具体情况下，无产阶级的阶级斗争是以民族解放斗争的形式出现的。
    毛泽东指出：“我们是国际主义者，我们又是爱国主义者，我们的口号是为保卫祖国反对侵略者而战。对于我们，失败主义是罪恶，争取抗日胜利是责无旁贷的。因为只有为着保卫祖国而战才能打败侵略者，使民族得到解放。只有民族得到解放，才有使无产阶级和劳动人民得到解放的可能。”（同书，第四八三页）
    共产党基于对客观形势的马克思列宁主义的分析，暂时放弃了旧的不适合当时历史情况的战略策略方针，而代之以新的完全适合当时开展民族革命战争任务的方针。
    共产党估计到抗日战争的民族解放性质时，首先认定自己的目的是把中国的全部政治力量和社会力量团结在抗日的旗帜下。
    共产党号召工农兵学商各界积极参加驱逐外寇的斗争。毛泽东写道：“全中国人民动员起来，武装起来，参加抗战，实行有力出力，有钱出钱，有枪出枪，有知识出知识。”（同书，第三一二页）
    毛泽东在其著作中指出，共产党的政治路线根本不同于那时中国当权的蒋介石政府的反动的反人民的政治路线。
    蒋介石在中国人民广大阶层的压力之下，同时也由于日本的侵略使得美英帝国主义在中国的利益以及大地主大资产阶级的利益受到重大的损失，不得不表明自己愿意进行抗战。但是，这与其说是诚心愿意反抗奴役者，不如说是花言巧语和被迫玩弄的手腕。国民党分子最怕人民大众的积极性，开展全民抗战的前途使他们万分惊恐。很明显，蒋介石集团的此种立场，必将陷国家于失败，使中国人民遭受奴役。
    与蒋介石采取的反动卖国政策相反，共产党根据中国全体爱国分子的要求，在军事、经济、政治和文化上采取了一系列的重大措施，用以保证广泛开展全民抗战，动员中国人民为救国而斗争。
    这些措施规定：全国人民总动员；武装全国人民；在前方开展对敌积极作战；在敌后组织游击战；国家机构民主化；减租；改善职工生活；普及国民教育；坚决肃清国内汉奸分子和投降妥协分子。
    抗日民族统一战线的建立，实际体现了共产党大力开展抗日战争和团结全民的政策。民族统一战线建立的必要性及其强大的生命力量，已为中国共产党的既往经验和欧洲各资本主义国家的民族解放运动的经验所证实。
    中国共产党在为建立民族统一战线而斗争时，了解国民党的反动实质，知道蒋介石政府的政策的反人民性，并且深知蒋介石一定会口是心非，玩弄两面手法。但是，建立民族统一战线是历史必然性，是战胜日寇的条件。因此，中国共产党屡次向国民党提议停止内战，成立两党的统一战线，以便共同抗日。
    在一九三七年二月致国民党中央全会的电文中，共产党提出了两党合作的具体条件，要求国民党全面停止内战，实行民主自由，召开国民大会，迅速准备抗日和改善人民的生活，而共产党自己也愿实现一系列的重大措施，以便于抗日统一战线的建立。
    在国内爱国运动高涨的情况下，蒋介石终于被迫表面上同意了建立民族统一战线。毛泽东写道：“现在两党重新结成的统一战线，形成了中国革命的一个新时期……历史的车轮将经过这个统一战线，把中国革命带到一个崭新的阶段上去。中国是否能由如此深重的民族危机和社会危机中解放出来，将决定于这个统一战线的发展状况。”（同书，第三二三页）
    统一战线的建立，证明各社会阶层和各党派的抗日合作已经建立起来。当然，所有这一切，并不是说人民与国民党政府间的矛盾，农民与地主间的矛盾，工人与资产阶级间的矛盾就已消灭。这些矛盾直到战胜侵略者还是不能解决的，但另一方面，共产党也并未放弃解决这些矛盾。
    共产党在估计时局的要求时，认为自己的任务是正确解决统一战线内各阶级间的相互关系问题。共产党表现了政治的灵活性和英明。它提出了新的口号和要求，这些口号和要求的实现，标志着国家的进一步发展，加强了对敌的斗争。
    在政治方面，共产党暂时放弃了建立工农民主专政的要求，提出了建立各阶层人民的民主共和国。它要求改变国内政治制度，成立新的政府，即民主共和国政府。毛泽东在说明这一政府的特点时指出：第一、它必须是一切主张抗日的阶级的联盟，其中必须包括工农及小资产阶级的其他阶层；第二、它必须按照民主集中制的原则组织起来；第三、它必须给人民以全部必需的政治自由。
    在社会关系方面，共产党实行减租减息和合理负担的政策以便动员农民的力量，同时暂时停止了完成土地革命的任务。这样做并不是因为已经没有必要解决如此极关重要的任务，而是为了团结中华民族的全部力量反对日本帝国主义。在经济方面，共产党还提出了一些改善人民生活的措施。这些措施完全符合于时局的要求，促进了民族统一战线的巩固。
    共产党在民族统一战线问题上的明确而有原则性的路线，它在统一战线内部的正确政策和为争取统一战线的群众性而进行的不倦的斗争，把统一战线变成了中国人民解放斗争的强大武器，保证中国人民终于战胜了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派。
    二、对军事理论问题的研讨
    军事理论问题在毛泽东选集第二卷中占有很重要的地位，这些问题对于中国共产党具有头等重要的意义，因为战争的胜负决定着中国的命运。
    毛泽东在“论持久战”、“抗日游击战争的战略问题”、“战争和战略问题”各篇著作中，对抗日战争的性质给了马克思列宁主义的说明，科学地分析了保证中国人民终将胜利的因素，指出了抗日战争的战略、策略特点，精辟地说明了游击战在整个战争中的意义。
    当时，中国的各党各派，对战争的前途、对战争应抱的态度议论纷纷。
    国民党的右翼上层，特别是汉奸汪精卫一派断定中国抗日必败。他们说：中国在经济上是个弱国，中国的武器不如日本；因此，“再战必亡”。持着这种观点的人，已经走上妥协和出卖民族利益的道路。
    此外，在中国还流行过另外一种观点，即速胜论。速胜论者陷入盲目的乐观，过低估计敌人的力量，走上了冒险主义的道路，其结果必然使中国遭受失败。
    从思想上粉碎这两种观点，对于抗战和中国人民的命运，都是十分重要的。毛泽东创造性地应用马克思列宁主义关于战争本质的原理，揭露了这两种观点的反科学的、主观唯心论的性质，论证了战胜日寇的可能性。
    主张妥协投降的人们，力图为自己的立场辩护，断言中日两国的力量对比是不利于中国的。他们说，日本是个小而强的国家，日本有很发达的工业，有为现代武器装备起来的强大的陆海军；而中国是个弱国，经济落后，武器很差。毛泽东无情地批判了这种对于力量对比的片面的、机械的看法。他指出，现在和将来影响战争进程的有下面几个因素：
    首先，日本的战争是帝国主义的、反动的、非正义的战争，它削弱着日本的实力；与此相反，中国的战争则是革命的、进步的、解放的战争，它增强着中国的实力。
    其次，日本虽是强国，但因其帝国主义本性，它正在走向没落；而中国已经走上革新的道路，它如日方升，正处于进步的时代。
    毛泽东指出，中国主要长处之一，就是：中国是个大国，地大、物博、人多、兵多。
    国际因素也给战争进程以很大的影响。中国战争的进步性，使它得到日益广大的国际援助；而日本的侵略，则必然使它在国际上陷于孤立。
    最后，历史情况的根本改变则是首要的因素。日本侵略者所发动的战争，是在资本主义总危机时代，是在世界帝国主义大崩溃的前夜，是在世界业已分成两个体系和苏联日益巩固的情况下进行的。毛泽东说：“特别是苏联的存在，鼓舞了中国的抗战。空前强大的社会主义的苏联，它和中国是历来休戚相关的。”（同书，第四一八页）
    毛泽东指明，决定战争结局的，不是残缺不全的片断；而是那些显然有利于中国的大小因素的相互作用。这一预见已被证实了。
    毛泽东也给“唯武器论”者以致命的打击。他指出，武器是战争的重要因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人。毛泽东指明：“力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。”（同书，第四三二页）
    毛泽东在论证中国胜利的各种可能性时着重指出：胜利不会自行到来，它必须经过残酷的斗争去争取；战争将是持久的。
    毛泽东指出：“这种持久战，将具体地表现于三个阶段之中。第一个阶段，是敌之战略进攻、我之战略防御的时期。第二个阶段，是敌之战略保守、我之准备反攻的时期。第三个阶段，是我之战略反攻、敌之战略退却的时期。”（同书，第四二五页）
    第二卷的各篇著作，全面地研讨了战争的战略战术问题，研讨了战略和战术方针随着战略阶段的改变而改变的问题。
    游击战在抗日战争中起着很大的作用。毛泽东在总结业已积累起来的经验时，提出了抗日游击战争的战略问题，指出了：主动地、灵活地、有计划地执行防御战中的进攻战，持久战中的速决战的意义；游击战争和正规战争相配合的重要性；建立根据地的必要性；游击战争的战略防御和战略进攻的特点；游击战争向正规部队的运动战的发展；游击战争的战略的集中指挥和战役战斗的分散指挥的必要性。他对游击战争的一些战术问题给了许多重要的指示。毛泽东对战略战术问题的研讨，是对军事艺术的理论的重大贡献。
    共产党所制定的抗日战争的战略战术原则，反映了反对外国帝国主义的压迫并为实现民主革命和民主自由而斗争的人民的全面革命战争的特点。中国共产党是全民战争的真正领导者和组织者，它动员了人民群众参加抗日，建立了人民军队，鼓舞了中国人民的胜利信心，并引导中国人民走向了伟大的胜利。
    三、为巩固共产党的队伍而斗争
    第二卷中的著作，对于用一切办法从组织上和思想上巩固共产党、提高党的队伍的思想水平和战斗力的问题，给予很大的注意。第二卷中的毛泽东的报告“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”，“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”，他的论文“反对自由主义”以及哲学著作“矛盾论”，对于党的巩固具有特别重大的意义。
    为了巩固自己的队伍和提高在解放运动中的领导作用，党在反“左”右倾机会主义的两条战线上进行了斗争，细心地保护自己的队伍不受敌对影响的渗入。
    在一九三七年日本军队开始大举进攻中国以前，党内主要的危险是“左”倾机会主义，亦即关门主义。它之所以危险，首先是因为它阻碍党的建立抗日民族统一战线的路线的实行。
    日本对中国的公开进攻、日本军队迅速深入中国本部并占领大城市、国民党集团的实际上的投降政策，以及党内存在着很大数量的小资产阶级成分，所有这一切，就使得党内的右倾机会主义分子活跃起来，他们把投降和不相信胜利的情绪带入了党的队伍。在这种情况下，右倾机会主义亦即投降主义就成了主要的危险。
    毛泽东同志以毫不调和的精神和高度的原则性提出了肃清机会主义的问题，以及必须反对党内的和国内的投降主义的问题，着重指出了阶级投降主义和民族投降主义之间的密切联系。
    在共产党在民族统一战线中的作用的问题上，同右倾机会主义分子展开了尖锐的斗争。右倾投降分子提出了“一切经过统一战线”的口号。这一口号的危险性在于它取消了共产党在统一战线中的独立自主。在国民党漠视一切党派的平等权利，力图迫使其他党派接受其领导的时候，这一路线实际上意味着共产党服从国民党，投降资产阶级。
    在斗争中共产党彻底击败了右倾机会主义分子，捍卫了自己在统一战线中的独立自主，巩固了同群众的联系和自己在抗日战争中的先锋作用，成了民族解放运动的公认的领导者。
    党由于全心全意为人民服务，执行正确的政策，以及党员在前线和后方的英勇行为，确立了自己的领导作用。为了巩固和扩大自己的领导作用，党进行了巩固党的纪律和加强党内民主的坚决斗争。不倦地教育了党员，使他们认识到他们的神圣职责，就是为人民服务。
    毛泽东写道：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，用以巩固党的集体生活，巩固党和群众的联系；关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”（同书，第三一九页）
    共产党对于提高自己的理论修养和党员的思想水平，表现了不倦的关怀，要求领导干部不断地掌握马克思列宁主义。
    对干部的思想教育和党的一切理论工作的进行，都是与实践，与解决斗争中的迫切问题紧密相联系的。
    毛泽东同志说道：“马克思列宁主义的伟大力量，就在于它是和各个国家具体的革命实践相联系的。对于中国共产党说来，就是要学会把马克思列宁主义的理论应用于中国的具体的环境。成为伟大中华民族的一部分而和这个民族血肉相联的共产党员，离开中国特点来谈马克思主义，只是抽象的空洞的马克思主义。”（同书，第四九七页）
    毛泽东同一切违背马克思列宁主义倾向进行了无情的斗争，坚决地批评了教条主义和经验主义，创造性地应用了理论来解决中国人民解放斗争中的迫切问题。
    “矛盾论”这一著作，在反对理论上的教条主义和经验主义的斗争中，在反对政策上的主观主义的斗争中，具有伟大的意义。这一著作给了党的政策以理论基础，指出了把马克思主义庸俗化对于中国共产党的活动的危害。
    毛泽东的著作是中国革命经验的深刻的理论总结。这些著作更加提高了中国共产党的思想理论水平，提高了它的战斗力，加强了它在中国人民的解放斗争中的领导作用。这些著作丰富了马克思列宁主义的革命理论。
    中国人民在共产党的领导下，胜利地完成了反帝反封建的革命，赶走了一切帝国主义者，推翻了反动统治，建立了自己的政权，目前正在奋不顾身地建设着新的生活。
