Central China Iron and Steel Company Fails to Honor Contract
Northwest Factories Suffer Production Losses
On June 29th, Comrade Zhang Yu Zhi of the Northwest Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building visited our newspaper's reader letters group and criticized the Central China Iron and Steel Company for failing to fulfill its contract to supply steel, resulting in production losses for some factories in the Northwest. We are now publishing a summary of his remarks and suggest that the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry investigate and handle this matter. On January 7th of this year, representatives from our Northwest Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building and representatives from the Central China Iron and Steel Company signed a contract in Beijing for the supply of special steel. The contract stipulated that we would make payment between March 16th and 20th and complete the pickup procedures by the end of March. On March 18th, in accordance with the contract, we remitted the full payment of over 370 million yuan to the Central China Iron and Steel Company. However, after the deadline, we did not receive any notification from the Central China Iron and Steel Company to pick up the goods. Because we were waiting to supply the steel to various factories in the Northwest, we immediately sent a special representative to the Central China Iron and Steel Company to negotiate the pickup. To our surprise, they claimed they were unaware of having signed a supply contract with our bureau and could not even find the contract at the time. Later, our representative informed them of the contract number, and they were then able to locate the contract. After repeated negotiations by the representative, they agreed to postpone delivery until the end of June. However, until now, we have not received any notification to pick up the goods.

Because the Central China Iron and Steel Company has failed to fulfill the contract, the production of many factories in the Northwest has been affected. For example, the newly built state-owned Second Cotton Textile Factory was originally scheduled to officially start operations in August of this year, but the delay in steel supply has postponed the factory's opening. The production plans of the Northwest Agricultural Tool Machinery Factory for manufacturing waterwheels and mine cars will also not be completed on time due to the lack of steel supply. Most seriously, for a certain newly built coal mine project, a portion of the project has been suspended and is awaiting materials due to the lack of this batch of steel; the steel used for another part of the project has been temporarily purchased at high prices on the market, consisting of substandard and inferior materials. This project will not only have its completion date delayed, but the quality of the project will also be greatly affected.

I believe that since the Central China Iron and Steel Company could not deliver the goods on time, they should have notified us promptly so that we could have had time to find alternative solutions to avoid significant production losses. It is even more inappropriate that they adopted a nonchalant bureaucratic attitude after receiving our remittance. Such erroneous behavior of treating contracts as child's play and disregarding the production of other units is very harmful to the country's construction work. They should conduct a self-criticism on this matter and correct this error in the future.

### 华中钢铁公司不执行合同  西北某些工厂生产受损失

    华中钢铁公司不执行合同
    西北某些工厂生产受损失
    六月二十九日，中央第一机械工业部西北供销分局张予之同志访问本报读者来信组，批评华中钢铁公司不履行供应钢材合同，致使西北某些工厂的生产受到损失。现将他的谈话摘要发表于后，并建议中央重工业部钢铁工业局检查处理。今年一月七日，我们中央第一机械工业部西北供销分局的代表和华中钢铁公司的代表在北京签订了一个供应特种钢材的合同。合同规定：我们在三月十六日到二十日付款，三月底办理提货手续。三月十八日，我们根据合同规定，将全部货款三亿七千多万元汇给华中钢铁公司。可是，到期后却不见华中钢铁公司拉货的通知。因为我们等着把钢材供应西北各工厂，就马上派专人到华中钢铁公司去接洽提货的事情。谁知道他们竟说不知道有和我们分局订供应合同这回事，甚至当时连合同也找不见了；后来我们派去的提货人告诉他们合同字号，他们才把合同找了出来。经提货人再三交涉，他们才答应延期到六月底交货。可是直到现在，还没有通知拉货。
    因为华中钢铁公司不履行合同，就影响了西北很多工厂的生产。像新建的国营第二棉纺织厂，原计划在今年八月正式开工，但因钢材不能及时供应，就延迟了该厂的开工时间。西北农具机械厂制造水车、矿车的生产计划，也将因为钢材供应不上而不能按时完成。尤其严重的是：某新建煤矿工程，因为这一批钢材供应不上，已经有一部分工程停工待料，另一部分工程所用的钢材则是临时用高价在市场上搜购来的一些不合规格的劣质材料；这个工程不但完工日期要延迟，而且工程质量也受了很大影响。
    我认为：华中钢铁公司既然不能按期交货，就应该及时通知我们，使我们有时间来另行设法补救，免得生产受到重大损失。而他们在收到我们汇去的货款之后，仍然采取漠不关心的官僚主义态度；更是不应该的。这种把合同当儿戏、不管其它单位生产的错误行为，对国家建设工作是非常有害的。他们应该对这件事作检讨，并在今后改正这种错误。
