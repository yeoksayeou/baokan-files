Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 3rd: The Syrian newspaper "Al Ayyam" reported that the Syrian and Lebanese authorities have reached an agreement on a common policy regarding oil and the revision of agreements concluded between the two countries and foreign oil companies.

The newspaper pointed out that the Syrian government had been negotiating with the "Iraq Petroleum Company," which is mainly controlled by American capital, regarding the revision of the agreement, but the negotiations had been suspended because the position taken by the "Iraq Petroleum Company" and the demands made by Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Shih Shakri were inconsistent. Shih Shakri demanded that the "Iraq Petroleum Company" pay the Syrian government forty-nine percent of all profits it derives from its oil pipeline passing through Syrian territory.

According to estimates by the Syrian Ministry of Finance, the amount of this profit reaches 200 million lira (Syrian currency) annually. However, according to the existing agreement, the "Iraq Petroleum Company" only pays Syria 120,000 pounds, or 1 million lira, annually. Therefore, Syria is demanding that the "Iraq Petroleum Company" pay it 100 million lira.

The newspaper also reported that the Lebanese authorities have also contacted representatives of the "Iraq Petroleum Company" and the "Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company," which is entirely American capital, to discuss the revision of existing agreements.

Note: The "Iraq Petroleum Company" is located in Kirkuk, Iraq. British, American, French, and Dutch monopoly capital groups all own shares, but the power is in the hands of American oil companies. The company currently has three pipelines from the oil-producing areas of Iraq to the Mediterranean coast, all of which pass through Syrian territory, and two of which pass through Lebanese territory after passing through Syrian territory.

The "Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company" is entirely American capital. The company's pipeline runs from Saudi Arabia through Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon to the Mediterranean coast, with an annual oil throughput of 15 million tons.

    叙利亚和黎巴嫩政府要求美国石油公司增付利润
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特三日讯：叙利亚“旷野报”报道，叙利亚和黎巴嫩两国当局对于石油以及修订两国和外国石油公司所缔结的协定的共同政策，已经取得协议。
    报纸指出，叙利亚政府已经和主要由美国资本控制的“伊拉克石油公司”进行关于修订协定的谈判，但是由于“伊拉克石油公司”采取的立场和叙利亚副总理施舍克里提出的要求未能一致，谈判已经中断。施舍克里要求“伊拉克石油公司”把它的输油管通过叙利亚领土所取得的全部利润的百分之四十九，付给叙利亚政府。
    据叙利亚财政部估计，这种利润的数目每年达二亿里拉（叙利亚货币）。但据现有的协定，“伊拉克石油公司”每年只付给叙利亚十二万英镑，即一百万里拉，因此，叙利亚要求“伊拉克石油公司”付给它一亿里拉。
    报纸还报道，黎巴嫩当局也已经和“伊拉克石油公司”及全部是美国资本的“横贯阿拉伯油管公司”的代表接触，讨论修订现有协定的问题。
    按：“伊拉克石油公司”设在伊拉克的基尔库克，英、美、法、荷垄断资本集团都拥有股票，但大权操在美国石油公司手里。该公司现有三条从伊拉克产油地通往地中海岸的输油管，这三条油管都通过叙利亚的领土，其中两条在通过叙利亚领土之后又通过黎巴嫩领土。
    “横贯阿拉伯油管公司”全部是美国资本，该公司的油管从沙特阿拉伯经过外约旦、叙利亚和黎巴嫩通到地中海岸，每年输油量为一千五百万吨。
