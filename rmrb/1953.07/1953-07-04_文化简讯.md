	Guangxi Film Team Goes Deep into Mountainous Areas Inhabited by Ethnic Minorities to Tour and Screen Films

	The Guangxi Provincial People's Government Film Team has been touring and screening films in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, receiving a warm welcome from people of all ethnicities. From August of last year to May of this year, the film team dispatched a total of five sub-teams, carrying 23 films including "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," "The Victory of the Chinese People," "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," and the Soviet film "Soviet Agriculture." They traveled to remote mountainous areas such as the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous Region, giving a total of 335 screenings attended by over 1,670,000 viewers from various ethnic minorities. The film team overcame various difficulties such as inconvenient transportation to tour and screen films in ethnic minority areas. To make it easier for people of all ethnicities to understand the content of the films, staff members adapted the film content into mountain songs according to the preferences of the local masses, and asked young men and women of various ethnic groups to sing in their native languages while explaining the content as the films were being screened, achieving great results. To further meet the cultural needs of ethnic minority people, the film team has opened a film training class with 30 young men and women from seven ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Yao, and Miao, participating in the study. After graduation, they will participate in film screening work in various ethnic minority areas.
	Gansu Provincial Health Department Manufactures Large Quantities of Iodized Salt Tablets
	Distributed Free of Charge to Patients with Goiter

	The Gansu Provincial People's Government Health Department has manufactured a large number of iodized salt tablets and distributed them free of charge to patients with goiter.
	Goiter is a chronic endemic disease, known to the masses as "Ying Guagua" or "Big Neck." Because drinking water in mountainous areas lacks iodine, many residents in these areas suffer from this disease. More than 50 counties and cities in Gansu Province have such patients, and more ethnic minority areas have a higher incidence of goiter. It is estimated that there are more than one million patients in Gansu Province. The Gansu Provincial People's Government Health Department has issued more than 6 million iodized salt tablets, and plans to issue another 18 million tablets, which can supply 400,000 patients.

    甘肃省卫生厅制造大批含碘食盐片
    免费发给甲状腺肿大病患者服用
    甘肃省人民政府卫生厅制造了大批含碘食盐片，免费发给甲状腺肿大病患者服用。
    甲状腺肿大病是一种慢性的地方病，群众称为“瘿瓜瓜”或“大脖子”。山岳地带饮水中缺乏碘质，所以这些地方的居民患这病的很多。甘肃省五十多个县市都有这种病人，特别是少数民族地区患甲状腺肿大病的较多。估计全甘肃省的患者约有一百多万人。甘肃省人民政府卫生厅已发出六百多万片含碘食盐片，计划再发一千八百万片，可以供给四十万患者服用。
