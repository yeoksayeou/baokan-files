Experiences of Local Oil and Fat Companies in Expanding Tung Oil Domestic Sales
Zhang Bingqian

    Expanding the domestic sales of tung oil is one of the central tasks of the China Oil and Fat Company this year. Local oil and fat companies have already achieved great success in this work. The sales volume of this system in the first quarter of this year reached ten times the sales volume of the same period last year. In the past two years, various localities have created and accumulated a lot of experience in expanding the domestic sales of tung oil, which is now summarized and introduced as follows:

    I. Publicity is the primary step in expanding sales channels. The better the publicity, the greater the sales achievement. Newspapers, film advertisements, posters, leaflets, blackboards, radio broadcasts and street broadcasts, fairs, temple fairs, materials exchange meetings, agricultural tool exhibitions, and theatrical performances in rural areas can be used to publicize tung oil. However, avoid specifically convening mass meetings for publicity, as that would hinder mass production. It is best to carry tung oil samples and oiled samples for publicity, explaining the properties of tung oil and the effects after use to the masses, and demonstrating them to the masses face-to-face. Before publicity, one should have some understanding of the local masses' production situation and oil consumption habits, so as not to be aimless. Publicity should also take into account both urban and rural areas. The Qinhuangdao Branch focused on the countryside in its publicity, with the result that oil paint industry in the city did not know that the company sold tung oil, let alone the general public. Convening private business symposiums in cities to carry out publicity and mobilization also has a great impact on sales. Reversing the masses' habit of using substitute oils can also expand sales. In the coastal fishing areas of Hebei Province, soybean oil, artemisia oil, and bean oil have always been used for oiling boats. After in-depth publicity, many fishermen went to the cooperative to buy tung oil to oil their boats.

    II. Before publicity, goods should be distributed to sales points (such as cooperatives, trust companies, stores, etc.), because after publicity, some oil users will immediately go to buy them. In Dongchangshou area on the Beijing-Hankou line, no one cared when the company first transported tung oil there. After publicity, nearby farmers went to buy it, and the daily sales reached four to five hundred catties at most. The Beijing Branch did not arrange the supply work in advance. After publicity in the suburbs, farmers could not buy tung oil when they wanted to, which had a negative impact.

    III. Tung oil should be promoted through various different methods. Among them, supplying tung oil directly to the broad masses of urban and rural people and fishermen through cooperatives is the most basic method. The tung oil sold through cooperatives in various regions generally accounts for 60% of the total sales, and even more than 80% in Hebei Province. Combining tung oil sales with purchasing tasks is a good way. Last year, the East China District Company exchanged a large amount of tung oil with the Shandong Native Produce Company for the same value of soybean oil; the Shijiazhuang Branch, in coordination with the purchasing task in November last year, exchanged 60 large barrels of tung oil for cottonseed oil from Yuanshi, Gaoyi, and Ningjin County Cooperatives, and both parties were satisfied. It is also effective to go deep into the masses to understand their oil needs and organize sales accordingly. Staff of the Xinji Office went to the countryside to understand the oil needs of farmers, registered the amount of oil needed, and established agreements with village cadres, and then delivered the oil to the village, which was very convenient for the masses. The Baoding and Shijiazhuang branches have signed annual supply contracts with local state-owned construction companies, ensuring a steady supply of oil for projects.

    IV. Discovering new uses for tung oil is also an effective way to expand sales. Beijing State-owned Xindu Iron Factory used to use soybean oil or castor oil to mix sand to make cores for radiator sand casting. Since Ge Qixie of the Beijing Branch's sales department suggested using tung oil instead, the sand casting cost was reduced by 8%, the rejection rate was reduced from 5% to 3%, and the corrosion resistance was also increased. The Xindu Iron Factory alone purchased more than 10,000 catties of tung oil per month. After more than a year of research, Wang Jinhai, a painter at the Beijing No. 2 Construction Engineering Company, successfully used tung oil to boil varnish (i.e., varnish, which is the main material for preparing various colored enamel paints, anti-rust paints, anti-fouling paints, and blending paints). This not only improved paint production but also expanded the consumption of tung oil. A salesman at the Sichuan Daxian Office persuaded the local United Soap Factory to switch to using tung oil for soap making. The finished product was of excellent quality, with abundant foam, strong detergency, and a lower cost than using other oils. The group from the Qinhuangdao Branch who went to Linyu for publicity suggested that the local construction company use tung oil to make putty (used for priming paint), which was cheap and did not crack even after being exposed to wind, rain, and sun. In the producing areas, tung oil is a very good lamp oil, because tung oil is cheap, and one catty can be used as two catties of vegetable oil for lighting.

    V. In the process of promoting tung oil, out-of-stock situations should be prevented. For example, Wenzhou is a tung oil producing and selling area, but it is often out of stock due to insufficient supply. The opposite situation is the accumulation of unsold stock. The Hebei Provincial Company directly transferred tung oil from Hankou to Zhangjiakou. There was no local agency itself, nor did it entrust cooperatives to sell it. As a result, not a single catty was sold. Secondly, the oil allocation should be adapted to the oil consumption habits of the masses, and should not be blindly transferred. People in Tianjin are accustomed to light-colored tung oil, and the dark-colored tung oil transferred by the Tianjin Company is not easy to sell. Third, we must prevent insufficient quantity and impure quality, and we must achieve "genuine goods at fair prices, no deception to the old or the young."

    各地油脂公司扩大桐油内销的经验
    张秉谦
    扩大桐油内销是中国油脂公司今年的中心工作之一。各地油脂公司在这件工作上已经取得很大的成绩。今年该系统第一季度的销售总量达到去年同期销售总量的十倍。两年来，各地在扩大桐油内销方面，已经创造和积累了不少的经验，现综合介绍如下：
    一、宣传是扩大销路的首要步骤。宣传得愈好，推销成绩愈大。可利用报纸、电影广告、宣传画、传单、黑板报、电台和街头广播、赶集、庙会、物资交流会、农具展览会以及在农村中演出戏剧等方式和机会进行宣传。但要避免专门召集群众大会进行宣传，那会妨碍群众生产。宣传时最好携带桐油样品和擦油后的样板，一面向群众讲解桐油的性能和使用后的效果，一面当面表演给群众看。在宣传前，应对当地群众的生产情况和用油习惯有所了解，才不致无的放矢。作宣传也要城乡兼顾。秦皇岛支公司宣传时偏重了农村，结果城市中的油漆业还有不知道公司出售桐油的，更不用说一般市民了。在城市中召开私商座谈会，进行宣传动员，在推销上的作用也大。扭转群众使用代用油品的习惯，也能扩大销路。河北省海滨渔区一向使用苏子油、蒿子油和豆油油船，经过深入宣传以后，很多渔民便去合作社买了桐油去油船。
    二、在宣传前应先将货物分布到销售点（如合作社、信托公司、商店等），因为宣传后有些需油户便会立刻前往购买。京汉线上东长寿地方，公司刚运来桐油时无人过问，经过宣传，附近农民纷纷前往购买，最多时日销四、五百斤。北京分公司事先未布置供应工作，在郊区宣传后，农民要买桐油却买不到，造成不良影响。
    三、应通过各种不同的方式方法来进行推销。其中通过合作社直接对广大城乡人民和渔区人民供应桐油是一个最基本的方法。各地区通过合作社推销的桐油一般都占全部销量的百分之六十，河北省甚至达百分之八十以上。结合收购任务推销桐油是一个好办法。去年华东区公司曾用大量桐油和山东土产公司交换同等价值的豆油；石家庄支公司在去年十一月配合收购任务，用桐油六十大桶交换元氏、高邑、宁晋三个县社的棉籽油，双方都感觉满意。深入群众了解用油情况，针对需要组织推销，收效也大。辛集办事处职工下乡了解农民需油情况，登记了用油数量，并和村干部成立了协议，然后将油送到村里，群众感觉很方便。保定、石家庄两支公司都和当地公营建筑公司签订了全年的供应合同，保证了工程用油的源源供应。
    四、发现桐油的新用途，也是扩大销路的有效办法。北京国营新都铁工厂一向用豆油或蓖麻油调砂做暖气片的翻砂芯子，自从北京分公司门市部葛启綷建议改用桐油后，翻砂成本降低百分之八，次品率由百分之五降低到百分之三，防蚀力也增大了，仅新都铁工厂一家即月购桐油一万余斤。北京市第二建筑工程公司油漆工人王金海经过一年多的钻研，使用桐油熬炼清漆（即凡立水，是配制各色磁漆和防锈漆、防污漆、调和漆的主要用料）成功后，不但在油漆制炼上得到改进，同时也扩大了桐油的消费量。四川达县办事处业务员说服了当地联合制皂厂改用桐油制皂，成品质量极好，泡沫多，去垢力强，成本也比用别的油品低。秦皇岛支公司去临榆宣传的小组建议当地建筑公司使用桐油自制腻子（油漆打底用），价钱便宜，经风吹雨淋日晒也不破裂。在产区，桐油是很好的灯用油，因桐油价廉，一斤能当二斤菜油点。
    五、在推销桐油当中应该防止脱销现象。如温州是桐油产地也是销地，因供应不足，时常脱销。与这相反的情况是积压不销。河北省公司由汉口直接调桐油至张家口，那里既无本身机构，也未委托合作社销售，桐油一到即存入专区社，结果没有售出一斤。其次要适应群众用油习惯，不能盲目调拨。天津人民惯用浅色桐油，天津市公司调进深色桐油就不易销售。第三，要防止分量不足和质量不纯的现象发生，要作到“货真价实，童叟无欺”。
