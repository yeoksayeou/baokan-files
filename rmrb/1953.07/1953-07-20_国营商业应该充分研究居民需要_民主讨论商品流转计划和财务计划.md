    State-Owned Commerce Should Fully Study Residents' Needs
    Democratically Discuss Commodity Circulation Plans and Financial Plans
    The Fengcheng County Department Store in Liaodong Province conscientiously studied the advanced experience of the Soviet commercial sector in formulating commodity circulation plans and financial plans, mobilized all employees to start from studying the needs of various major classes for major commodities, discussed the commodity circulation plan, gave play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, corrected the subjective and conservative thinking of leading cadres, made the plan truly a powerful tool to guide business, improved business management, and improved the quality of work, ensuring the overfulfillment of the commodity circulation plan and financial plan for the second quarter.
    The experience of Fengcheng County Department Store in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in formulating commodity circulation plans proves that a serious study of consumer needs is the correct way to formulate commodity circulation plans. This requires strengthening the investigation of residents' needs. According to the Soviet experience, China's specific socio-economic situation, and the initial experience already gained by the Fengcheng County Department Store, the following methods can be adopted at present: First, calculate residents' purchasing power; second, analyze changes in the commodity composition of residents' needs; third, establish a shortage registration system and a registration system for buyers' feedback on the variety and quality of goods in retail institutions; fourth, sign supply and sales contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives and labor mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives.
    The Soviet Union's sales plan is based on precise scientific statistics. The calculation of residents' purchasing power and its uses is determined based on factors such as the number of people with independent incomes in different economic zones and major classes. Today, we cannot yet carry out such scientific statistics, and can only adopt some simple and feasible methods. The Fengcheng County Department Store's calculation of residents' purchasing power and its uses is based on a typical survey of three villages conducted by the Fengcheng County Finance and Economic Commission in the autumn of 1952 with relevant units. Although this cannot completely accurately judge the specific needs of people in various regions and classes for the quality and quantity of various commodities, it is an important basis for studying residents' needs and formulating commodity sales plans.
    Understanding the county's population structure (including the number of floating population) plays a significant role in formulating sales plans. The Fengcheng Department Store obtained these materials from the civil affairs, education, and finance and economic commissions. Under the existing conditions, having this figure makes it easy to calculate the total sales task based on the needs of each class for major commodities.
    When conducting surveys of residents' needs, the method of filling out general forms cannot be adopted, and only the method of typical surveys and holding forums with residents by category can be adopted. Attention must be paid to the different needs of people in different regions, different occupations, different ethnic groups, different ages, and different living standards. The content should not be too complicated, and efforts should only be concentrated on clarifying the needs of various residents for the variety and quantity of major commodities. We should not only pay attention to consumer goods, but also have a good understanding of farmers' demands for means of production. We should not only pay attention to products that the country lacks, but also study how to change the specifications and quality of products that are produced more and have slow sales, and adjust prices and remanufacture and refit them to meet the needs of the people so that existing production equipment can be fully utilized. Commodities should not be studied in isolation, and attention must be paid to major changes in residents' economic, cultural, and political lives.
    State-owned commerce must also pay attention to the proportion of public and private sectors when formulating commodity circulation plans. The Fengcheng County Department Store determined how to solve the problem of the proportion of public and private sectors based on the actual sales ratio in 1952 grasped by the Fengcheng County Finance and Economic Commission and the Industry and Commerce Section. The retail ratio of state-owned stores and cooperatives in towns is mainly determined based on the actual sales situation of each retail unit in 1952. At present, China not only has state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, but also private commerce. If the proportion operated by cooperative commerce and private commerce is not deducted, then the sales plan of state-owned commerce will not be realistic. When preparing for the discussion of the plan, the Fengcheng County Department Store also absorbed relevant personnel from the cooperative to jointly study the needs of residents, which not only made the plan more accurate, but also played a leading role in the state-owned economy.
    The experience of Fengcheng County Department Store in learning from the Soviet Union proves that financial plans can also be discussed among employees. The financial plan mentioned here does not refer to how to prepare credit, cash, and other plans, but to mobilize all employees to discuss how to reduce commodity circulation costs and how to accelerate the turnover of goods and funds. As long as all employees are informed of the significance of saving and accumulating funds for national construction, employees will enthusiastically expose losses, waste, and slow capital turnover caused by poor management, which is combined with the work of improving business management and the struggle against bureaucracy and supply-based management thinking.
    When the employees of Fengcheng County Department Store discussed the financial plan, they exposed many shortcomings in the work caused by poor business management. In order to solve these problems well, the leadership analyzed and summarized the opinions put forward by the employees, and launched a rationalization proposal campaign to solve these problems. According to the rationalization proposals put forward by the employees, the leadership formulated new responsibility systems or contact contracts after sorting and research. In order to comprehensively eliminate shortcomings in the work and further educate the employees, the employees were mobilized to deliberate and discuss the initially formulated system, and finally listened to the employees' opinions, added supplements and modifications, and used it as a system to be jointly observed by all employees. In this way, the problems exposed by the employees were reasonably solved, and the purpose of mobilizing the employees to further improve business management was achieved.
    The experience of Fengcheng County Department Store in learning from the Soviet Union proves that mobilizing employees to discuss national plans is an important method of running state-owned enterprises well by relying on all employees. State-owned commerce is an enterprise of a socialist nature. Employees are the masters of state-owned enterprises and the direct executors of national plans. After discussion by employees, advanced and practical plans can be formulated, and the completion and overfulfillment of plans can be effectively guaranteed. This is not only the right and obligation of employees, but also the responsibility of the leadership. Leading cadres of all state-owned commercial departments must firmly grasp the idea of relying on employees to run state-owned commerce well, overcome the bureaucratic work style of relying solely on administrative orders, and learn the leadership method of following the mass line.
    The above facts show that the basic practices of the Soviet commercial sector in mobilizing employees to democratically discuss plans and fully study residents' needs when formulating plans are what China's state-owned commerce should learn and can learn.

### 国营商业应该充分研究居民需要  民主讨论商品流转计划和财务计划

    国营商业应该充分研究居民需要
    民主讨论商品流转计划和财务计划
    辽东省凤城县百货公司认真地学习苏联商业部门制订商品流转计划和财务计划的先进经验，发动全体职工从研究各主要阶层对主要商品需要的情况着手，讨论商品流转计划，发挥了职工的积极性和创造性，纠正了领导干部的主观主义和保守思想，使计划真正成为指导业务的有力工具，改进了经营管理，提高了工作质量，保证超额完成了第二季度的商品流转计划和财务计划。
    凤城县百货公司学习苏联先进经验制订商品流转计划的经验证明：认真地研究消费者的需要是制订商品流转计划的正确途径。这就要加强居民需要的调查工作。根据苏联的经验，我国的具体社会经济情况和凤城县百货公司已取得的初步经验，目前可采用以下各种办法：一、计算居民的购买力；二、分析居民需要的商品构成的变化；三、在零售机构中建立缺货登记制度与买主对商品的品种、质量的反映的登记制度；四、和供销合作社和劳动互助组或农业生产合作社之间订立供销合同。
    苏联制订销售计划是以精密的科学统计做根据的，对居民的购买力及其用途的计算是根据不同的经济区和各主要阶层有独立收入的人口数等因素来确定的。我们今天还不可能进行这样的科学统计，还只能采取某些简而可行的办法。凤城县百货公司对居民购买力及其用途的计算，是根据一九五二年秋凤城县财政经济委员会组织有关单位进行的三个村的典型调查推算出来的，这虽然还不能完全准确地判断各地区和各阶层人民对各种商品的质和量的具体需求情况，但这却是研究居民需要和制订商品销售计划的重要依据。
    了解全县人口的结构情况（包括流动人口数）对制订销售计划有着很大的作用。这些材料，凤城百货公司是从民政、教育、财政经济委员会等部门取得的。在现有的条件下，有了这一数字，就便于根据各阶层对主要商品需要情况，推算出总的销售任务。
    在进行居民需要调查的时候，不能采取普遍填表的办法，只能采取典型调查与分类开居民座谈会的方式。必须注意到各地区、各种不同职业、不同民族、不同年龄、不同生活水平的人民的不同需要。内容不能过于繁杂，只能集中力量弄清各种居民对主要商品品种、数量的需要。不能只注意消费资料，必须很好地了解农民对生产资料的要求。不能只注意国家缺乏的产品，还必须同时研究如何改变生产较多，销路迟滞的产品的规格、质量，并调整价格与改制改装，以适应人民需要，使现有的生产设备能够充分发挥效率。不能孤立地研究商品，必须注意到居民的经济生活与文化生活以及政治生活上的重大变化。
    国营商业制订商品流转计划时还必须注意到公私比重。对于如何解决公私比重问题，凤城县百货公司是根据凤城县财政经济委员会、工商科所掌握的一九五二年实际销售比重来确定的。城镇国营商店与合作社的零售比重，主要是根据各零售单位一九五二年实际销售情况确定的。我国目前不仅有国营商业与合作社商业，而且还有私营商业，如果不扣除合作社商业与私营商业所经营的比重，那末，国营商业的销售计划就不切合实际了。凤城县百货公司在做讨论计划的准备工作时，还吸收合作社有关人员，共同研究居民的需要，这样不仅可把计划做得更准确一些，而且又起了国营经济的领导作用。
    凤城县百货公司学习苏联的经验证明：财务计划也可以在职工中进行讨论。这里所说的财务计划不是指的如何编制信贷、现金等计划，而是发动全体职工讨论如何降低商品流转费用，如何加速商品和资金的周转。只要向全体职工说明节约与积累资金对国家建设的意义，职工就会热情地揭发由于经营管理不善所造成的损失、浪费与资金周转迟缓的现象，这就和改善经营管理的工作，和反官僚主义、反供给制经营思想的斗争结合起来了。
    凤城县百货公司职工在讨论财务计划时，职工揭发了许多由于经营管理不善所造成的工作上的缺点。为了很好地解决这些问题，领导上把职工提出的意见做了分析，归纳，又发动全体职工开展合理化建议运动，来解决这些问题。领导上根据职工提出的合理化建议，经过整理研究，制订出新的责任制度或联系合同。为了全面地消除工作上的缺陷和更进一步地教育职工，又发动职工酝酿讨论初步制订出来的制度，最后听取职工的意见，加以补充修改，做为全体职工共同遵守的制度。这样就使职工揭发出来的问题，得到合理的解决，达到了发动职工进一步改善经营管理的目的。
    凤城县百货公司学习苏联的经验证明发动职工讨论国家计划，是依靠全体职工办好国营企业的重要方法。国营商业是社会主义性质的企业，职工是国营企业的主人，是国家计划的直接执行者，经过职工讨论，可以制订出先进的、切实可行的计划，切实保证完成与超额完成计划，这不仅是职工应有的权利和义务，而且也是领导的责任。各国营商业部门的领导干部都必须牢固地掌握依靠职工办好国营商业的思想，克服专靠行政命令办事的官僚主义的工作作风，学习走群众路线的领导方法。
    上述事实说明：苏联商业部门发动职工民主讨论计划并在制订计划时充分研究居民需要的基本作法，是我国国营商业应该学习和能够学会的。
