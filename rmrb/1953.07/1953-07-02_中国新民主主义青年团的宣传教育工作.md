The Propaganda and Education Work of the China New Democratic Youth League

For the past four years, the China New Democratic Youth League has become a powerful assistant to the Chinese Communist Party in publicizing the Party's various policies and conducting Marxist-Leninist education for young people.

In the successive political movements, the Youth League organizations at all levels, in conjunction with the Party's central work in each period, assisted the Party in conducting political and ideological education for League members and the broad masses of young people. During the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement, Youth League organizations in various places conducted education for young people to foster hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism, and to support the Korean people's struggle against aggression, promoting patriotism and internationalism, and extensively publicized the great significance of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle to the masses. After a series of educational campaigns, millions of young people responded to the call of the motherland and participated in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle. A large number of young people signed up to join military cadre schools; in the summer of 1951 alone, 330,000 intellectual youths signed up. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, League organizations at all levels assisted the Party in educating young people to stand firmly on the working-class position and draw a clear line of demarcation between the bourgeoisie and the working class. In the struggle, young people actively responded to the Party's call and became active elements in publicizing to the masses and reporting corruption and theft. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the broad masses of young people devoted themselves to the increase production and practice economy movement in the industrial sector and the patriotic bumper harvest movement in rural areas. Youth League organizations in various places promptly carried out propaganda and education related to production for young people, cultivating their patriotic labor attitude and labor enthusiasm, and mobilizing them to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production. In the summer of 1951, League organizations in various places systematically organized League members to participate in Party rectification studies, which played a significant role in improving League members' understanding of the nature and tasks of communism and the Communist Party, as well as improving League members' level of awareness. In addition, League committees in various places conducted relatively systematic education on the basic knowledge of the League to varying degrees for League members and the broad masses of young people, enabling them to understand the nature and tasks of the League and how to be a good League member.

In the process of carrying out propaganda and education on production for League members and the broad masses of young people, the League organizations assisted the Party in cultivating advanced figures among young people and educated the broad masses of young people through the publicity of these advanced figures, achieving the desired results. For example, the Youth League organization in the Northeast 53 Factory assisted the Party in cultivating advanced young people, summarizing and publicizing their advanced ideas and advanced experiences, which played a significant role in driving the broad masses of young people to reach a common level of ideological awareness. After the Third Plenary Session of the First National Congress of the Youth League, League committees in various places paid attention to commending good people and good deeds, exposing bad people and bad deeds, in order to cultivate the fine qualities and style of young people, and paid attention to overcoming the phenomenon of some League members and young people being divorced from the masses, not observing labor discipline, and not cherishing state property.

In conducting political and ideological education for young people, the League's newspapers and periodicals have become powerful weapons for League committees at all levels. The central organ newspapers and periodicals of the Youth League, "China Youth Daily" and "China Youth" bi-monthly, have now become reading materials loved by the broad masses of young people and League cadres. According to statistics, the circulation of the above two newspapers and periodicals has reached more than 400,000 copies. There are now 28 local League newspapers and periodicals targeting young workers and peasants. There are seven local newspapers and periodicals for children. "China Children's News," led by the Central Committee of the Youth League, has become the most beloved reading material for the broad masses of children. "China Youth Publishing House" (formerly known as "Youth Publishing House"), led by the Central Committee of the Youth League, has published 429 kinds of books, with a circulation of more than 36 million copies. Among them, "The Story of Zoya and Shura" has been issued 1.19 million copies, and "Basic Knowledge Textbook for the Youth League" has been issued 2.7 million copies. These books, newspapers and magazines have had a profound impact on Youth League members and the broad masses of young people.

In the past four years, some local League organizations have also adopted a variety of methods that are popular with the masses to conduct propaganda and education for young people. Many League organizations, according to specific conditions, have systematically organized League members and young people to listen to reports from advanced figures and heroic figures, read newspapers, watch movies, visit exhibitions, read literary works, attend League classes, and hold League Day activities, all of which have achieved great results. This educational method is currently being vigorously promoted by League committees in various places.

The Youth League has also achieved many successes in assisting the Party in establishing and consolidating the propaganda network. At the beginning of 1952, Youth League members serving as propagandists in Beijing accounted for 29 percent of the total number of propagandists in the city. In Henan Province, 43 percent of the propagandists were Youth League members. Among the 50 model propagandists in Jiangxi Province, 22 were Youth League members. League members are also active members in organizations such as reading groups and cultural centers in various places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国新民主主义青年团的宣传教育工作
    四年来，中国新民主主义青年团在宣传中国共产党的各项政策，对青年进行马克思、列宁主义教育方面，已成为党的有力助手。
    在历次政治运动中，各级团的组织结合党在每一时期的中心工作，协助党对团员和广大青年进行了政治思想教育。在抗美援朝运动中，各地青年团组织向青年进行了仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义、支援朝鲜人民反抗侵略斗争的爱国主义和国际主义的教育，并向群众广泛宣传了抗美援朝斗争的伟大意义。经过一系列的教育后，千百万青年响应了祖国的号召，参加了抗美援朝斗争，大批青年报名参加了军事干部学校，仅一九五一年夏季报名参加军事干部学校的知识青年就有三十三万人之多。在“三反”“五反”运动中，各级团组织协助党向青年进行了站稳工人阶级立场、划清资产阶级与工人阶级的思想界限的教育，青年们在斗争中积极响应了党的号召，成为向群众进行宣传的、和检举贪污、盗窃行为的积极分子。在“三反”“五反”运动以后，广大青年投入工业部门的增产节约运动和农村爱国丰产运动，各地团的组织又及时地向青年进行了有关生产的宣传教育，培养了青年的爱国主义的劳动态度和劳动热情，动员他们积极参加工农业生产。一九五一年夏，各地团组织有计划地组织了团员参加了整党学习，这在提高团员对共产主义与共产党的性质和任务的认识，以及提高团员的觉悟水平方面，起了很大作用。此外，各地团委并在不同程度上对团员和广大青年进行了比较系统的团的基本知识的教育，使他们认识了团的性质、任务以及如何做一个好团员。
    团的组织在向团员和广大青年进行生产的宣传教育的过程中，协助党培养青年中先进人物，并通过对这些先进人物的宣传来教育广大青年，收到了应有的效果。例如东北五三工厂中的青年团组织，协助党培养青年先进人物，总结和宣传他们的先进思想和先进经验，对带动广大青年达到共同的思想觉悟，起了很大作用。青年团一届三中全会以后，各地团委注意了表扬好人好事，揭发坏人坏事，以培养青年的优良品质和作风，并注意克服某些团员和青年中脱离群众、不遵守劳动纪律、不爱护国家财富的现象。
    在对青年进行政治思想教育中，团的报刊已成为各级团委的有力武器。青年团中央机关报刊“中国青年报”和“中国青年”半月刊现在已成为广大青年和团的干部所喜爱的读物。据统计，上述两种报刊发行量都已达到四十多万份。以青年工人、农民为对象的地方团报、团刊现在已有二十八种。地方少年儿童报刊计七种。青年团中央领导的“中国少年报”已成为广大少年儿童最喜爱的读物。团中央领导的“中国青年出版社”（原名“青年出版社”）已出版书籍四百二十九种，发行三千六百余万册。其中如“卓娅和舒拉的故事”已发行达一百一十九万册，“青年团的基本知识教材”已发行达二百七十万册。这些书报杂志在青年团员和广大青年中有了深刻的影响。
    四年来，有些地方团的组织还采用了群众喜闻乐见的、多种多样的方式对青年进行宣传教育。许多团的组织根据具体条件，有计划地组织团员和青年听先进人物和英雄人物的报告、读报、看电影、参观、读文艺作品和上团课、举行团日活动等，都收到了很大的效果。这种教育方法，目前各地团委正在大力推广。
    青年团在协助党建立和巩固宣传网的工作中也获得了很多成绩。在一九五二年初，北京市担任宣传员的青年团员已达全市宣传员总数的百分之二十九，河南省的宣传员中，百分之四十三都是青年团员。江西全省五十名模范宣传员中，有二十二名是青年团员。在各地读报组、文化馆等组织中，团员也是积极的活动分子。（新华社）
