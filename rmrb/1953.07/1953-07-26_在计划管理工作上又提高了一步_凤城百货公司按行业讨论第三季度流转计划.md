Another Step Forward in Planning Management
    Fengcheng Department Store Discusses Third Quarter Circulation Plan by Industry

    The Fengcheng County Department Store in Liaodong Province has taken another step forward in planning management. The third quarter commodity circulation plan was formulated through discussions by employees according to different industries. This resulted in a more accurate and reasonable plan, and also greatly increased the employees' confidence in completing the plan.

    In the past, the Fengcheng County Department Store discussed plans by company or by branch, wholesale department as a whole, with all employees participating in the discussion. As a result, the discussions took a long time, participation was not widespread, and the plans formulated were not detailed and accurate enough. Discussing plans by industry involved organizing employees by their specialty. For example, when discussing the fabric plan, all salespersons in charge of fabric were brought together to form a large group, which was then divided into smaller groups according to business type such as branch, wholesale department etc. to specifically discuss the fabric plan. After the small groups discussed, the results were submitted to the large group for approval. The main product plans approved by the large groups were then consolidated into the company's overall plan. This discussion method not only made the plan more accurate and shortened the discussion time (saving seven days compared to the discussion of the second quarter plan), but also more deeply mobilized the employees, who gained full confidence in completing the plan.

    Each branch formulated its plan based on the number of urban and rural households, population, and occupational distribution, the proportion of social material supply and retail sales in the county in 1952, the increase in purchasing power in the county in 1953, the sales situation in the first half of this year and the same period last year, and careful study of the people's needs in the third quarter. The target for the third sales department for the third quarter, assigned by the superior, was 1.54 billion yuan. Calculated on the basis of 79 business days, it had to sell more than 19 million yuan per day to complete the task. They first began to discuss the food group, which accounted for 70 percent of sales. The food group sold an average of 15 million yuan per day in the second quarter. The employees believed that the third quarter was the off-season, and the sales amount would not be greater than in the second quarter. The leadership then pointed out the basis of the plan and the favorable conditions for completing the third quarter plan: September 22 is the Mid-Autumn Festival, which will undoubtedly increase food sales; last year, 5,000 jin of mooncakes were not enough to sell for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the people's living standards have improved even more this year, so they will definitely sell more. Already, many cooperatives have come to the company to order mooncakes. In addition, a certain unit buys at least 10,000 jin of white sugar every month, and there are many other fixed customers like this.... With this inspiration, the employees began to discuss enthusiastically. One said: The third quarter is hot weather, and beer will definitely sell more than in the second quarter. Another said: Ice cream and popsicles are fast-selling items, so we can sell more white sugar... After careful calculation, the food group can sell at least an average of 15 million yuan per day. The general merchandise group also realized that the third quarter is the hot summer season, and soap, scented soap, towels, as well as children's clothing and floral fabrics, will also sell more than in the second quarter. After discussion, everyone suggested that there would be no problem selling an average of 5 million yuan per day. Calculated in this way, the third sales department's sales plan for the third quarter is fully guaranteed to be completed. Finally, the plan was confirmed by a general meeting of all employees of the sales department. The employees had both a goal to strive for and a reliable basis for completing the plan, and everyone was very satisfied.

    Discussing plans by industry makes the plans more accurate. For example, the annual plan for cotton cloth was 136,000 bolts, and 65,150 bolts had been completed in the first half of the year. After discussion and research by the professional group, it was proven that 72,335 bolts were needed in the second half of the year, so 1,500 bolts were added. The annual sales plan for soap was 85,000 dozen, but only 29,100 dozen were completed in the first half of the year. After the professional group studied the issue, they found that the reason was that when discussing the annual plan, they did not consider that some units were producing and supplying it themselves. In addition, the calculation of six bars per household in rural areas at that time was also high. This time, it was revised, and the plan for the second half of the year was set at 31,750 dozen.

    在计划管理工作上又提高了一步
    凤城百货公司按行业讨论第三季度流转计划
    辽东省凤城县百货公司在计划管理上又提高了一步。第三季度的商品流转计划是发动职工按照不同的行业讨论制订的，这样订的计划更加准确、合理，职工完成计划的信心也更增强了。
    过去，凤城县百货公司讨论计划都是以公司或门市部、批发部为单位，由全体职工在一起讨论，结果是时间长，发言不普遍，订出的计划不够细致和准确。按行业讨论计划是以专业组为单位，如讨论布匹计划时，把所有管布匹的营业员集中起来组成一个大组，再按门市部、批发部等业务性质划分成若干小组，专门讨论布匹计划。小组讨论完提交大组讨论通过，各大组讨论通过的主要品种计划，综合起来就是公司的全面计划。这种讨论方法不仅使计划比较更加准确，缩短了讨论的时间（比讨论第二季度计划节省了七天时间），而且更深入地发动了职工，职工对完成计划也有了充分的信心。
    各门市部都是根据城乡户数、人口、职业区分，一九五二年全县社会物资供应比重及零售比重，一九五三年全县购买力提高情况，今年上半年和去年同时期的销售情况，并仔细研究了第三季度人民需要情况来制订计划的。第三门市部第三季度卖钱任务，上级给的指标是十五亿四千万元，按营业七十九天计算，每天要卖一千九百多万元才能完成任务。他们先从占卖钱额百分之七十的食品组开始讨论。食品组第二季度平均每天卖钱一千五百万元，职工们认为第三季度是淡季，卖钱额不会比第二季度大。领导上就指出了计划的根据和完成第三季度计划的有利条件：九月二十二日是中秋节，无疑会多卖食品；去年中秋节准备了五千斤月饼不够卖，今年人民生活水平更加提高了，肯定要多卖，现在就已有不少合作社到公司来订购月饼。另外，某单位每月至少买一万斤白糖，像这样固定的主顾还有不少……。这样一启发，职工们就热烈地讨论开了，这个说：三季度正是热天，啤酒一定比二季度卖的多，那个说：冰淇凌、冰棍是畅销的东西，因此咱们的白糖也就能多卖了……。仔细一算，食品组每天平均最少也能卖一千五百万元。百货小组也认识到第三季度是夏令伏天，肥皂、香皂、毛巾以及小孩服装、花布等也要比第二季度多卖，大家讨论以后提出每天平均卖五百万元不成问题。这样一计算，第三门市部第三季度的卖钱计划完全有把握完成。最后由门市部全体职工大会讨论，把计划肯定了下来。职工们既有了奋斗目标，又有了完成计划的可靠依据，大家都很满意。
    按行业讨论计划，能使计划比较更趋于准确。如棉布，全年计划是十三万六千匹，上半年已完成六万五千一百五十匹，经过专业小组讨论研究，证明下半年需要七万二千三百三十五匹，于是就增订了一千五百匹。肥皂全年推销计划是八万五千打，上半年只完成二万九千一百打，经专业组研究找出了原因是：在讨论全年计划时未考虑到有一部分单位自己生产供应，另外当时农村按每户六块计算也高了，这次就做了修正，确定下半年计划为三万一千七百五十打。
