    The Linxiang County People's Government Should Stop the Waste of Saplings
    Lan Bo, of the CCP Linxiang County Seventh District Committee, Hunan Province, writes: The Linxiang County Nursery Garden does not understand the situation thoroughly and blindly distributes saplings, causing great waste. On April 13th, I went to work in Shimiao Township, Seventh District, and found a load of pine saplings (estimated to be more than 10,000) piled next to the stove in the township government, being used as kindling. I asked Comrade Deng Jinlian, the chairman of the township farmers' association, why the saplings were being burned as firewood. She said: "The county said it was to 'green the countryside,' and insisted on giving us the saplings a few days ago. Our township already has forests on the mountains, and we asked the village cadres to take the saplings to plant, but the villagers don't want them." The Linxiang County Nursery Garden's practice of forcibly distributing saplings without considering the actual situation is wrong, and the Shimiao Township People's Government's practice of burning saplings as firewood is also wrong; it is suggested that the Linxiang County People's Government quickly take effective measures to stop this intolerable waste.

    临湘县人民政府应制止浪费树苗的行为
    中共湖南省临湘县七区区委会蓝波来信：临湘县苗圃园不深入了解情况，就盲目分配树苗，造成很大浪费。四月十三日我到七区石庙乡去工作，发现该乡人民政府有一担松树苗（估计有一万余株）堆在火炉边，用来作引火柴。我问乡农民协会主任邓金莲同志为什么要把树苗当柴烧。她说：“县里说是要‘绿化农村’，前几天硬把树苗发给我们。我乡山上都有了树林，我们叫各村干部领树苗去栽，村里群众都不要。”临湘县苗圃园不根据实际情况硬派树苗的做法是错误的，石庙乡人民政府把树苗当柴火烧的做法也是错误的；建议临湘县人民政府迅速采取有效措施，制止这种令人不能容忍的浪费现象。
