    The Yunnan Provincial People's Government Establishes Malaria Prevention and Treatment Center in Simao County
    Simao County, Yunnan Province, is launching a campaign to eradicate malignant malaria (commonly known as miasma). The Yunnan Provincial People's Government has established a malaria prevention and treatment center in Simao County.
    Ethnic minorities account for more than 67 percent of the total population of Simao County, Yunnan Province. Malaria has historically been prevalent in the county, greatly impacting the health of the people. In recent years, through the patriotic health campaign, the incidence of malaria in urban areas has been significantly reduced. In order to achieve the goal of complete eradication, the malaria prevention and treatment center will systematically carry out focused treatment and prevention, help the local ethnic groups establish mass malaria prevention organizations, and train grassroots malaria prevention workers to lay the foundation for future prevention and treatment work. The center has now dispatched mobile prevention and treatment teams to help the ethnic groups carry out patriotic health campaigns and provide free treatment to them.

    云南省人民政府在思茅县成立疟疾防治所
    云南省思茅县正展开对恶性疟疾（俗称瘴气）的根治工作，云南省人民政府在思茅县成立了一个疟疾防治所。
    云南省思茅县的少数民族人民占全县人口的百分之六十七以上。该县历来疟疾流行，对人民健康影响很大。近年来，经过爱国卫生运动，城区疟疾发病率已显著减低。为了达到根治目的，疟疾防治所将有计划地进行重点治疗和预防；并帮助当地各族人民建立群众性的防疟组织，培养基层防疟工作人员，为今后防治工作打下基础。现在该所已派出巡回防治组，帮助各族人民开展爱国卫生运动，并免费为各族人民治疗。
