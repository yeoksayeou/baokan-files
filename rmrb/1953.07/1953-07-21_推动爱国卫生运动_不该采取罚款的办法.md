    Promoting the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Fines Should Not Be Used
    Su Duo from the Inner Mongolia Water Conservancy School writes: The patriotic health campaign in Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has made considerable progress thanks to the joint efforts of the broad masses of citizens and various organizations. However, the Tongliao branch processing plant of the China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation pays very little attention to hygiene. Despite repeated urgings from the city's Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, the situation has not changed. The factory's dormitories and kitchen are not cleaned for long periods, and cattle horns and beef are thrown all over the ground; the kitchen floor is covered with potato peels, and rice bowls are thrown around without being washed after use; flies fill the processing room, and dust flies everywhere; cow dung is piled up a foot deep in the yard. Therefore, the Tongliao City Patriotic Health Campaign Committee issued a notice on May 30, pointing out that the above situation violated public health regulations, caused a very bad influence among the masses, and hindered the development of industry health work in the city; the notice concluded by saying: The committee has decided to "impose a fine of RMB 500,000 on the Tongliao branch of the China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation... The fine will be paid by the cadres and is prohibited from being apportioned among the workers."
    I believe that the actions of the processing plant affiliated with the Tongliao branch of the China National Foodstuffs Export Corporation in neglecting hygiene are very wrong; it is entirely necessary for the Tongliao City Patriotic Health Campaign Committee to inspect, urge, and criticize the plant, but their attempt to promote the patriotic health campaign through fines is inappropriate. The patriotic health campaign should be promoted through publicity, education, and methods of criticism and commendation; if the Tongliao branch processing plant continues to neglect hygiene despite repeated criticisms, to the extent that it endangers public health, it may be necessary to request the government's public health department to impose certain penalties to punish past mistakes and prevent future ones.

    推动爱国卫生运动
    不该采取罚款的办法
    内蒙古水利学校苏铎来信称：内蒙古自治区通辽市的爱国卫生运动，在广大市民群众和各机关团体的共同努力下，有了不少成绩。但是中国食品出口公司通辽支公司加工厂对卫生工作却极不注意，虽经市爱国卫生运动委员会多次的督促，情况仍未改变。该厂宿舍、厨房长期不清扫，牛角牛肉扔得满地；厨房地面满是土豆皮，饭碗用后不洗就到处扔；加工室内蝇子满屋飞，尘土飞扬；院内牛粪堆积盈尺。于是，通辽市爱国卫生运动委员会在五月三十日发了一个通报，指出以上情况已违反了公共卫生条例，在群众中造成极坏影响，并对市内行业卫生工作的开展起了阻碍作用；通报在最后又说：委员会已决定“对食品出口公司通辽支公司给予罚款人民币五十万元的处分，……罚款由干部中出款，禁止从工友中均派。”
    我认为，中国食品出口公司通辽支公司所属加工厂不注意卫生的行动是十分错误的；通辽市爱国卫生运动委员会对该厂进行检查、督促和批评是完全必要的，但是他们想以罚款来推动爱国卫生运动的做法是不妥当的。推动爱国卫生运动应用宣传教育和批评表扬的方式；像通辽支公司加工厂这样屡经批评而仍不注意卫生，以致违害公众卫生的行为，在必要时可以提请政府公共卫生部门给以一定处分，以惩前毖后。
