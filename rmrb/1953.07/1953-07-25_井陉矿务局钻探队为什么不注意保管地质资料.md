Reader's Letters Summary

    Reader Wang Qingshu and Xie Deming write: On June 10th of this year, the drilling project of the No. 4 drill hole in the Second Mining Area of the Jingxing Mining Bureau was completed, and the drilling machine has been moved to a new construction site. The geological data (rock and coal cores) extracted from this drill hole should have been immediately sent to the geological department for proper preservation, but the Jingxing Mining Bureau Drilling Team still left these materials in the open air at the old drill hole, without any dedicated personnel responsible for guarding them. They didn't consider the risk of these geological materials being stolen or weathered at all. The geological department repeatedly urged them to move these materials into the warehouse, but the team's core recorder made excuses such as "small quantity, not worth moving" or "no time" and refused to send them. Later, the geological department directly approached the team leader, but the team leader did not pay attention to this either, and it was not until July 5th that these two boxes of rock and coal cores were transported to the team's office. However, after more than 20 days of wind and rain, the rock and coal cores were completely weathered; the rock cores had become碎块碎块碎块 broken pieces, and the coal cores had become rotten black mud, completely losing their value for geological research. It is hoped that the relevant personnel of the team will overcome the above shortcomings so that drilling work can provide reliable geological data for the country's large-scale economic construction.

### 井陉矿务局钻探队为什么不注意保管地质资料

    井陉矿务局钻探队为什么不注意保管地质资料
    读者王清戍、谢德明来信：今年六月十日，井陉矿务局第二矿区第四号钻眼的钻探工程已经完工，钻机已迁往新工地。在这个钻眼提取出的地质资料（岩、煤芯）本应马上送交地质部门妥为保存，但井陉矿务局钻探队却仍然把这些资料放在旧钻眼的露天地里，也无专人负责看管。他们根本不考虑到这些地质资料是否有被盗和风化的危险。地质部门曾多次催促他们把这些资料移送入库，但该队岩芯总记录员却藉口“数量较少，不值移送”或“没有时间”而不送。后来地质部门又直接找该队队长，但该队队长对此也未重视，拖到七月五日才把这两箱岩、煤芯运到该队办公室。但因为经过二十多天的风吹雨打，岩、煤芯完全风化，岩芯已成碎块，煤芯成烂黑泥状，完全丧失了地质研究的价值。希望该队有关人员对上述缺点加以克服，使钻探工作能给祖国大规模的经济建设提供可靠的地质资料。
