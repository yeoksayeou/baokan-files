A letter from reader Bei Da Ken: Summer has arrived, and the weather is hot. In the windows of the Huangshi City Department Store branch in Hubei Province, wool yarn, woolen fabrics, and other winter supplies are still displayed, while the various undershirts, mosquito nets, summer fashions, and summer hygiene products urgently needed by the working people are nowhere to be seen. Local citizens who enter the branch are invariably disappointed by this situation and walk out. Although this is a small matter, it reflects the fact that the business practices of some of our state-owned stores are divorced from the masses.

    黄石市百货公司门市部
    为什么不按季节备货
    读者北大垦来信：盛夏来了，气候炎热。湖北省黄石市百货公司门市部的橱窗里，还摆满着绒线、毛织品及其他冬季用品，而劳动人民迫切需要的各式汗衫、蚊帐、夏令时装，夏季卫生用品等却看不到。当地市民走进门市部，看到这种情况都不由扫兴地走出去。这虽是件小事，但却反映出我们某些国营商店的经营作风是脱离群众的。
