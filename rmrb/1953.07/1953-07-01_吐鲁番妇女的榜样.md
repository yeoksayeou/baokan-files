    Hailiqi Khan is the first Uygur woman in Turpan County, Xinjiang, to join the Chinese Communist Party. She is the women's director of the Second Administrative Village of the First Township of the Second District, and a standing committee member of the People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in Turpan County. Her actions in leading and helping women participate in agricultural production have moved women of all ethnic groups in the First Township of the Second District. When people talk about Hailiqi Khan, they all say with respect: She is our role model.
    Hailiqi Khan lost her father when she was very young. Before liberation, her grandmother and mother worked for landlords. The family had no house and no land.
    After the establishment of the people's government in Turpan County, Hailiqi Khan, like a bird out of a cage, enthusiastically threw herself into the struggle of the peasants to turn over. During the rent reduction movement, she investigated, publicized, and mobilized women to participate in rent reduction work day and night. At the same time, she joined the New Democratic Youth League. After the land reform, she, like other poor peasants, received land and livestock. Because she had been tempered in her work, she honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party after the land reform. When she stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to take the oath, she could not suppress the excitement in her heart. She was determined to dedicate all her strength to the Party and the people.
    Last July, the Turpan County People's Government mobilized peasants throughout the county to open up an irrigation canal at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains on the Gobi Desert to guide the snow water of the Tianshan Mountains. At the mobilization meeting, the men in the village signed up to participate, but no women signed up. Hailiqi Khan was the first to sign up and led other women to participate in the canal construction. At that time, the temperature in the Turpan Basin had risen to 47 degrees Celsius, and the sun on the Gobi Desert was like a raging fire. Hailiqi Khan led the women to the construction site more than 50 miles away to participate in the canal excavation. They carried the heavy stones they dug out to the shore. They did not rest when the men did not stop working. As a result, the project, which was expected to be completed in ten days, was completed in eight days. At the end of the project, Hailiqi Khan was named a model worker. Because the project was particularly difficult, only half of it was completed last year. At the end of May this year, the peasants in the county continued to excavate and repair the canal. This time, Hailiqi Khan was elected as the captain of the women's team. She helped the women overcome difficulties until the canal was completed and the canal was filled with rolling snow water, and then they went home.
    During the spring plowing this year, the men were very busy. Hailiqi Khan led the women of the entire administrative village to dig out the manure from the toilets and livestock pens of each household. Then the men loaded the manure into carts and transported it to the fields, and the women spread the manure. This year, the entire administrative village applied more than 23,000 carts of manure to wheat and cotton fields, exceeding the amount of fertilizer applied in previous years. The 1,600 mu of wheat fields in the village were weeded three times, all by the labor of women. Therefore, the wheat this year is growing better than in any previous year. It is estimated that the yield per mu will increase by more than 40 jin compared with last year. Everyone said: "The wheat is good this year, and half of the credit goes to the women."
    Hailiqi Khan is illiterate, so when she publicizes to the peasants, she often does not explain everything completely. Whenever this happens, Hailiqi Khan feels pain and says: I have caused losses to the Party again! This spring, after she started learning to read, she has been able to understand newspapers and write simple notes due to her active efforts.

    吐鲁番妇女的榜样
    新华社记者  韩文慧  王安
    海丽琪汗是新疆吐鲁番县第一个加入中国共产党的维吾尔族妇女。她是二区一乡二行政村的妇女主任、吐鲁番县各族各界人民代表会议的常务委员。她领导和帮助妇女参加农业生产的行动，感动着二区一乡的各族妇女。大家一谈起海丽琪汗，都以尊敬的口吻说：她是我们的榜样。
    海丽琪汗从小就失去了父亲。解放前，祖母和母亲都给地主家干活。家里没有房子，也没有一分土地。
    吐鲁番县人民政权建立后，海丽琪汗像一只出笼的鸟，热情地投入农民翻身的斗争中。在减租运动中，她不分日夜的调查、宣传并动员妇女参加减租工作。同时加入了新民主主义青年团。土地改革后，她和其他的贫苦农民一样分得了土地和耕畜。由于她在工作中经过了锻炼，土地改革结束后，她光荣地加入了中国共产党。当她站在毛主席像前宣誓时，不能抑住心头的激动，她下定决心：一定要把自己全部力量献给党和人民。
    去年七月间，吐鲁番县人民政府动员全县农民在天山脚下的戈壁上，开辟一条导引天山雪水的灌溉渠道。在动员会上，村里的男人纷纷报名参加，却不见妇女报名。海丽琪汗首先报名，并带动其他妇女参加修渠。当时，吐鲁番盆地的气温已上升到摄氏四十七度，戈壁上的太阳像烈火一样，海丽琪汗领着妇女到五十多里外的工地，参加挖渠工作。她们把挖出来的沉重石块往岸上抬，男人不停工，她们也不休息。这样，预计十天完成的工程，结果八天就完成了。工程结束，海丽琪汗被评为模范。由于这条渠道的工程特别艰巨，去年只完成了一半。今年五月底，全县农民又继续挖修，这一次，海丽琪汗被选为妇女队的队长，她帮助妇女们克服着困难，直到渠道修成，满渠流着滚滚的雪水后，她们才回家去。
    今年春耕时，男人们都很忙，海丽琪汗领导全行政村的妇女，把各家的厕所和牲畜圈里的粪都挖出来，然后由男人们把粪装车拉运到地里，又由妇女们把粪撒开。全行政村今年给麦田和棉田共上了两万三千多车粪土，超过了历年的施肥量。全村一千六百多亩麦田拔了三遍草，全部是妇女们的劳动。所以今年麦子长得比过去任何一年都好。估计每亩比去年可增产四十多斤，大家都说：“今年麦子好，有一半功劳是妇女的。”
    海丽琪汗不识字，所以向农民们宣传时，经常有些地方讲不完全。每逢发生这种情况，海丽琪汗就感到痛苦，她说：我又给党造成了损失！今年春天，她开始学文化后，由于积极努力，现在已能看懂报纸和写简单的笔记了。
