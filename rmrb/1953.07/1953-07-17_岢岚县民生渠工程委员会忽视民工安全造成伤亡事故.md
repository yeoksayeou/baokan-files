    The Kelan County People's Livelihood Canal Project Committee Neglects Worker Safety, Causing Casualties
    A letter from eight readers including Ding Jiuchou, Lu Picheng, and Yuan Wei of the Kelan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanxi Province: In August 1952, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau sent personnel to our county to build the People's Livelihood Irrigation Canal. Because of many problems in the design and construction, a section of the project that cost over 100 million yuan to build last year was scrapped this year. This spring, the bureau re-surveyed and decided to change the route. However, after the route change, the canal needed to pass through the Huangyaota Highlands northwest of the city. The soil of the highlands is loose and crumbly, and the canal is deep. During construction, the soil continuously collapsed. The leading cadres of the canal project committee turned a blind eye to this serious problem, resulting in continuous worker casualties.

    On May 30th, it rained and thundered, and workers ran into the more than four-zhang-deep canal to dig small caves to take shelter from the rain. As a result, the soil cliffs collapsed, killing three workers and injuring eight. The Provincial People's Government and the Special Commissioner's Office have sent inspection teams to investigate and deal with this accident. However, the leading cadres of the project committee still do not pay attention to the safety of the workers. From June 28th to 30th, it rained heavily for three consecutive days. After the rain, construction continued on this dangerous section. Workers discovered cracks in the top of the canal and immediately reported it to the cadres in charge of construction. However, these cadres did not consider the safety of the workers and insisted on continuing construction, resulting in a large amount of soil collapsing on the side of the canal on the afternoon of July 2nd, killing nine workers and injuring four.

    We believe that the Shanxi Provincial People's Government should immediately investigate this incident, give due punishment to those derelict personnel who caused serious worker casualties, and send technicians to Kelan to re-examine the entire design work of the People's Livelihood Canal.

### 岢岚县民生渠工程委员会忽视民工安全造成伤亡事故

专栏：读者来信摘要

    岢岚县民生渠工程委员会忽视民工安全造成伤亡事故
    中共山西省岢岚县委会丁九畴、路丕成、袁伟等八个读者来信：一九五二年八月，山西省水利局派员在我县修建民生灌溉渠。因为设计和施工中问题很多，去年花费一亿多元开凿的一段工程今年报废了。今春该局又重新进行了勘察，决定改变线路。但是，改线路后渠道需经过城西北黄鹞塔高地。高地土质松酥，而渠道又深，在施工中土块不断下陷，该渠工程委员会领导干部对这一严重的问题却熟视无睹，以致连续发生民工伤亡事故。
    今年五月三十日，天降雷雨，民工跑进四丈多深的渠内掏小窑避雨，结果土崖陷落，压死民工三人、压伤八人。这一事故已经省人民政府和专署派检查组进行检查处理。但工程委员会领导干部对民工安全问题还是不重视。六月二十八日至三十日，连下三天大雨。雨后这一有危险性的工段仍然继续开工。工人发现渠顶有裂缝，当即报告领导施工的干部。但这些干部们却毫不考虑民工安全，仍坚持继续施工，以致七月二日下午，渠侧土块大量下落，将正在挖土的工人压死九人，压伤四人。
    我们认为：山西省人民政府应该立即对这一事件进行检查，给造成民工严重伤亡事故的失职人员以应得处分；并派技术人员前来苛岚重新审查民生水渠的全部设计工作。
