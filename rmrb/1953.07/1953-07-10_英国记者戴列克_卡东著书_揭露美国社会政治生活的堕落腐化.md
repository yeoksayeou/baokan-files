(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The magazine "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published on June 26th, carried a book review introducing "America in 1953" by the famous British journalist Derek Kartun.

In the book, Kartun cites specific facts to illustrate the prevalence of crime in American society and the collusion between American monopoly capital and major gangster bosses. Kartun points out that the notorious gangs in the United States are all related to various monopoly capitals, or their leaders are themselves big capitalists. They are also in collusion with state and municipal officials, police, and judges, thus getting away with impunity. Under these circumstances, the United States has become the country with the most prevalent crime in the world. In 1952 alone, there were over two million recorded criminal cases nationwide. More than one million of these were committed by teenage boys and girls. Every year, 250,000 children are tried in American courts. In New York City alone, 1,500 students use drugs. In Chicago, 300 children were tried for drug use in one month of 1951.

Kartun explains the role played by so-called "comic strips" and television programs in this regard. According to survey results, two-thirds of the 300 types of comic strips endlessly depict death and destruction. A week's worth of television programs in Los Angeles included 127 homicide cases, 101 "justified" killing cases, 357 attempted murder cases, 93 abduction cases, and 3 cases of branding with red-hot irons.

The situation is no better for what is supplied to adults for their "cultural needs." Books promoting war and pornography flood the market and are hailed as "amazing achievements." Kartun quoted Pollock, one of the "Fifteen Americans" selected by the New York Museum of Modern Art, about his painting method. Pollock "paints by laying the canvas on the floor, walking on the cloth, and letting the paint drip from the bottle. He himself doesn't know what he will paint." Kartun cited another unbelievable thing in American social art. Pound, who was in an insane asylum, received the Library of Congress Poetry Prize for creating "obscure" poems. During World War II, this Pound was Mussolini's Fascist broadcaster.

The atmosphere of fear of communism artificially stirred up by the American ruling group has caused unbelievable situations. Even translators of the Bible have become suspicious. Kartun cited a report from the "Los Angeles Examiner": Because someone said that some translators had communist backgrounds, seven hundred Advent church representatives decided to temporarily disapprove the new Bible revision and passed a resolution to form a committee to investigate the backgrounds of the Bible translators.

The American ruling group is so afraid of the truth and progressive ideas in art that Robeson cannot sing his songs of freedom, Fast cannot write books, Chaplin cannot make films in Hollywood, and Trachtenberg, the president of International Publishers, is being tried for publishing Marxist-Leninist books.

In summarizing the nervousness and war hysteria that dominate the United States today, Kartun wrote: "Is it any wonder that 16,993 people committed suicide in the United States in 1950? Is it any wonder that 50,000 people use drugs, 3.8 million are drunkards, and 950,000 of them are insane with alcohol? Is it any wonder that one in four married couples gets divorced? Is it any wonder that 9 million people (6 percent of the total population) suffer from mental illness or other diseases?"

### 英国记者戴列克·卡东著书  揭露美国社会政治生活的堕落腐化

    英国记者戴列克·卡东著书
    揭露美国社会政治生活的堕落腐化
    据新华社讯：六月二十六日出版的“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”刊载了一篇书评，介绍英国名记者戴列克·卡东所著的“美国的一九五三年”一书。
    卡东在书中列举具体事实，说明美国社会中犯罪盛行和美国大垄断资本与大土匪流氓头子的勾结。卡东指出，美国的著名匪帮都和各种垄断资本有关系，或者其首领本人就是大资本家。他们又与州市官员、警察和法官有勾结，因此逍遥法外。在这种情形下，美国成为世界上犯罪最盛行的国家。在一九五二年内，全国有记录的犯罪案就超过二百万件。其中有一百多万件是十几岁的男女青年所犯的。每年有二十五万儿童在美国法庭受审。单在纽约一地，就有一千五百个学生吸食毒品，在芝加哥，一九五一年一个月中就有三百个吸食毒品的儿童受审。
    卡东说明所谓“连环图画”和电视节目在这一方面所起的作用。据调查结果，在三百种连环图画中，有三分之二是无穷无尽地描写死亡和破坏的。洛杉矶一周的电视节目中，有一百二十七件凶杀案，一○一件“有道理的”杀害案，三五七件谋杀未遂案，九十三件拐骗案，三件用烧红的铁烙人案。
    供给成人的“文化需要”的东西，情况也决不好一些。宣扬战争和色情的书充斥市场，被誉为“惊人的成就”。卡东引了纽约现代艺术博物馆所选的“十五个美国人”之一的波洛克的关于他自己绘画方法所讲的话。波洛克“绘画是把画布铺在地板上，在布上漫步行走，让油彩从瓶子里滴下。他自己也不知道他会画成个什么。”卡东举出美国社会文艺中另一件难以置信的事情。疯人院里的庞德因为创作了“含糊不清”的诗而得到了国会图书馆的诗歌奖。在第二次大战时，这个庞德曾是墨索里尼的法西斯广播员。
    美国统治集团人为地煽起的对共产主义的恐惧气氛，引起了难以置信的情况，连圣经的翻译者也成了可疑分子。卡东引了“洛杉矶考察报”报道的一件事：由于有人说某些翻译者有共产党背景，七百个降临节的教会代表决定暂不批准新的圣经订正版，他们通过成立一个委员会来调查圣经翻译者的背景。
    美国统治集团害怕真理和进步的思想艺术如此，所以罗伯逊不能唱他的自由歌曲，法斯特不能写书，卓别麟不能在好莱坞拍制影片，国际出版社的社长特拉腾堡因为出版马克思主义、列宁主义的书而受审。
    卡东在总结统治着今天的美国的神经质与战争歇斯底里时写道：“一九五○年在美国有一万六千九百九十三人自杀有什么奇怪吗？五万人吸食毒品、三百八十万人狂饮而其中九十五万人中了酒疯又有什么奇怪呢？每四对结婚的人中有一对离婚有什么奇怪吗？九百万人（全部人口的百分之六）害精神病或其他的病又有什么奇怪呢？”
