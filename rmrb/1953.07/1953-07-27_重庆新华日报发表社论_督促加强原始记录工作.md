The Chongqing Xinhua Daily published an editorial on July 15th regarding the work of rectifying original records in state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest Region. The editorial stated: Most major state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest Region have now established original records, and some have even been established for more than two years. However, very few have truly achieved comprehensiveness, accuracy, and timeliness. The current situation in factories and mines can be roughly divided into three types. The first type has relatively comprehensive, accurate, and timely indicators, allowing factory and mine leaders to promptly discover new creations of the masses and problems in production through original records, which can be used as the basis for quota management and operation plans. These factories and mines are few in number. The second type has records of major indicators and can report them in a timely manner, but they are not accurate enough. Although these records can enable factory and mine leaders to discover some problems in production, it is difficult to fully understand the specific situation of production and identify key problems based on the analysis of these records. Although these records can be used as an important reference for formulating quotas and compiling plans, they cannot be used as a reliable basis. These factories and mines are also few in number. The third type has incomplete, inaccurate, and untimely indicators. The original records of these factories and mines can be summarized as "incomplete personnel, inaccurate records, unclear to the masses, and unused by leaders."

The editorial pointed out that the most fundamental reason why the original records of the vast majority of factories and mines are not well done is that factory and mine leaders lack a comprehensive understanding of planning management. They only generally grasp the plan and cannot specifically grasp the operation plan. They also do not understand or do not fully understand what a correct plan should be based on. Therefore, they have not put the work of rectifying original records on the agenda and seriously studied and solved it. The editorial pointed out: The view that operation plans should be carried out after sound original records and average advanced quotas are established, or the practice of not focusing on the central link of operation plans and putting operation plans, quota management, and original records on the same level, are all wrong. However, neglecting the work of original records is also incorrect. Failing to rectify original records based on work needs around the operation plan will affect the correct formulation of the operation plan. Therefore, to strengthen the work of original records and effectively rectify the original records so that they can gradually meet the requirements of production, it is necessary to make the leaders of factories and mines comprehensively understand planning management, correctly understand the relationship between operation plans, original records, and quotas, and recognize that not only can the situation in production be promptly understood from the analysis and accounting of original records, the main problems in production be identified, and more advanced quotas and operation plans be formulated, so that plans are based on something, but also technical problems can be discovered and solved from the analysis of original records. It is also possible to find ways to improve product quality and reduce product costs from the analysis of original records.

The editorial pointed out that in order to do a good job in original record work, it is also necessary to fully mobilize the masses. It is necessary to use concrete examples to explain the importance of original records to the workers and masses. In order to truly mobilize the workers and masses to actively participate in planning work and attach importance to original records, repeated publicity and education should be carried out from top to bottom, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses. It is necessary to make comrades who do original record work feel at ease with their work and record carefully, and to make workers help recorders record, so that all kinds of records are detailed and accurate, and the records can play a guiding role in production. At the same time, the editorial pointed out the importance of equipping appropriate record personnel and educating existing record personnel. The editorial finally emphasized that once records are made, they must be used carefully. For the main problems in production that appear every day, solutions should be sought from a thorough analysis of the original records; when reviewing the implementation of the previous month's plan and discussing the next month's plan, the original records should be used as an important basis. In this way, on the one hand, problems in the original records themselves can be discovered and the original records can be further improved; on the other hand, the guiding role of the original records in production will be brought into play. Through vivid facts, the broad masses of workers and staff will further recognize the importance of original records, and the work of original records will be continuously enriched and improved on a solid mass basis.

    重庆新华日报发表社论
    督促加强原始记录工作
    七月十五日重庆新华日报对西南区国营厂矿整顿原始记录工作，发表了社论，社论中说：西南区各主要国营厂矿现在一般都已建立了原始记录，而且有的已经建立两年多了，但是真正做到全面、准确、及时的还是很少。目前各厂矿的情况大体上可以分为三种类型。第一种是指标比较全面、准确、及时，可以使厂矿领导干部通过原始记录及时发现群众的新创造和生产中的问题，能够作为定额管理和作业计划的依据的，这类厂矿为数很少。第二种是主要指标已有了记录而且能够及时报出，但还不够准确，这些记录虽然也能使厂矿领导干部通过它发现生产中的一些问题，但还很难依据对这些记录的分析就比较全面的弄清生产中的具体情况；找出生产中的关键问题。这些记录虽然可作为制订定额和编制计划的重要参考，但还不能作为可靠的依据。这类厂矿也是不多的。第三种是指标不全面、不准确、不及时。这类厂矿的原始记录概括的情况叫做“人员不全，记录不准，群众不明，领导不用”。
    社论指出，绝大多数厂矿原始记录作得不好的最根本的原因，是厂矿领导干部对于计划管理，缺乏全面的认识。只是一般地抓计划，还不能更具体地抓住作业计划，也不了解或不完全了解一个正确的计划所应依据的是什么，因此就没有将整顿原始记录的工作提到议事日程上来，认真地去研究它解决它。社论指出：那种认为有了健全的原始记录和平均先进定额后再搞作业计划的看法，或者不抓紧作业计划这一中心环节，把作业计划、定额管理、原始记录平列起来的做法都是错误的，但是忽视原始记录工作也是不对的。不围绕着作业计划从工作需要出发整顿原始记录就会影响正确地制订作业计划。因此要加强原始记录工作，将原始记录切实地整顿起来，使它逐渐能够满足生产上的要求，就必须使厂矿的领导干部全面地认识计划管理，正确认识作业计划、原始记录与定额的相互关系，认识从原始记录的分析核算中不仅可以及时了解生产中的情况，找出生产中的主要问题，制订比较先进的定额和作业计划，使计划有所依据，而且从原始记录的分析中也可以发现并解决技术上的问题；也可以从原始记录的分析中找到如何提高产品质量，降低产品成本的门路。
    社论指出，为了作好原始记录工作，还必须充分发动群众。要用具体的事例向职工群众说明原始记录的重要。为了确实地将职工群众发动起来，积极参加计划工作，重视原始记录，应该由上而下，由党内到党外，从干部到群众进行反复的宣传教育，要使做原始记录工作的同志安心于自己的工作并认真记录，要使工人帮助记录员记录，从而使各种记录都做到详细准确，使记录能在生产上起指导作用。同时，社论指出了必须配备适当的记录人员，并对现有记录人员进行教育的重要。社论最后强调指出：有了记录，还必须认真地使用。对于逐日出现的生产中的主要问题，应该从周密的分析原始记录中寻求解决的办法；在检查上月计划执行的情况和讨论下月的计划时，都应该把原始记录作为重要的依据。这样，才能一方面发现原始记录本身中的问题，进一步的提高原始记录；另一方面原始记录在生产上的指导作用就会发挥出来。通过活生生的事实，也就会使广大职工群众进一步的认识原始记录的重要，原始记录工作就会在一个雄厚的群众基础上不断地充实提高起来。
