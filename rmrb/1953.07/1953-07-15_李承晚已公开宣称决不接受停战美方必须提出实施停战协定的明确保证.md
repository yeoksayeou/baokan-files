(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 14th, Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) "How long is the U.S. government prepared to delay the Korean armistice?" – World opinion has ample reason to ask such a question. Because since the plenary session of the delegations of both sides resumed on the 10th, another five days have passed. As of today, there are no signs of an imminent armistice at Panmunjom, which indicates that the U.S. side has not yet been able to provide clear guarantees that Syngman Rhee will abide by the armistice agreement.

Since the Syngman Rhee group has publicly declared that it will never accept an armistice, whether the U.S. side can provide reliable guarantees for implementing the armistice agreement is the key to whether the current negotiations can make progress. However, the U.S. side is releasing more and more rumors, claiming that the U.S. has obtained assurances from Syngman Rhee that he will accept the armistice, and that Syngman Rhee has made "significant concessions." The "New York Herald Tribune" even shamelessly stated that the United Nations Command had "provided the Communist side with appropriate assurances that South Korea would abide by the agreement once it is signed." The sole purpose of these claims is clearly to distort the truth and absolve the U.S. side of responsibility for delaying the armistice.

Has Syngman Rhee really made "significant concessions" and given guarantees to accept the armistice? Let's look at the facts.

Syngman Rhee has consistently opposed the armistice, the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war. After Robertson's meetings with Syngman Rhee for more than half a month, has Syngman Rhee made any concessions on these issues he opposes? No!

Syngman Rhee still opposes the armistice. The joint statement by Robertson and Syngman Rhee does not mention Syngman Rhee's acceptance of the armistice at all. And Syngman Rhee declared on the same day that he had not accepted the armistice, but only agreed not to obstruct it for ninety days. To prove this statement, Syngman Rhee launched demonstrations in Busan yesterday demanding a "northward advance" and "opposing an armistice that does not achieve unification."

Syngman Rhee still opposes the Korean Armistice Agreement. The joint statement between Syngman Rhee and Robertson does not mention the armistice agreement at all. Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, said yesterday, "Our position remains opposed to concluding an armistice agreement based on the current armistice terms."

Syngman Rhee also still opposes the agreement on the prisoner of war issue. The statement by Syngman Rhee and Robertson does not mention the issue of recovering the more than 27,000 prisoners of war forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee. Instead, it attempts to further obstruct the implementation of the prisoner of war agreement by unilaterally claiming that all KPA prisoners of war not directly repatriated should be released in South Korea, and continues to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

It is clear that Syngman Rhee has not abandoned his arrogant demands to oppose the armistice and undermine the armistice. To enable his ambitious plans to be realized, Syngman Rhee has made many demands on the United States. Has Syngman Rhee abandoned these demands now? Or, as the American propaganda machine says, has he "made concessions"? No! Not only has he not, but the United States has given Syngman Rhee many things he did not originally ask for.

In early June, Syngman Rhee's demands on the United States were: 1. Sign a "mutual defense treaty"; 2. The United States increase its economic and military assistance to Syngman Rhee; 3. The United States guarantee not to prevent Syngman Rhee's actions to "unify Korea." In response to Syngman Rhee's demands, Eisenhower made three guarantees to Syngman Rhee on June 7: 1. To achieve "unified Korea" by all "peaceful means"; 2. To negotiate a "mutual defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee; 3. To continue to provide economic assistance to Syngman Rhee.

Now, after more than ten meetings, what has Robertson given Syngman Rhee? According to U.S. news agencies, Robertson has promised Syngman Rhee: 1. To sign a "mutual defense treaty"; 2. To re-equip four more divisions of the ROK army to reach a target of twenty divisions; 3. To provide large-scale military and economic assistance; 4. To not demand Syngman Rhee return the more than 27,000 prisoners of war who have been forcibly detained; 5. To limit the political conference to ninety days; 6. To take a consistent stance with Syngman Rhee at the political conference, advocating a UN-supervised plebiscite at the political conference, and if the political conference cannot achieve Syngman Rhee's goals within ninety days, the United States will withdraw from the political conference together with Syngman Rhee and "take all actions required by the situation."

It can be seen that what Robertson has promised to give Syngman Rhee has greatly exceeded what Syngman Rhee had requested, and greatly exceeded what Eisenhower had promised. No wonder Pyun Yung-tai said triumphantly that what Syngman Rhee had gained in his talks with Robertson was "sixty percent" more than they had originally hoped for. In fact, it is more than one hundred percent.

Not only that, but Robertson also had a large stack of bills opened by Syngman Rhee in his briefcase, ready to pay them in Washington. Three points have already been revealed: 1. The quantity of military and economic assistance the United States provides to Syngman Rhee; 2. The plan to withdraw from the political conference; 3. The details of the "mutual defense treaty."

Are there any more agreements? Syngman Rhee revealed one on the day Robertson left Korea, which is that he did not accept the armistice, but only promised not to obstruct the armistice for ninety days. At the time, Robertson said: "This is simply unbearable for us - we had an agreement." Robertson claimed that he and Syngman Rhee had reached a "broad agreement," which is undoubtedly the most important agreement besides the above six. This agreement shows that the U.S. government agreed to Syngman Rhee not being bound by the armistice agreement, and agreed that he could undermine the armistice. Apart from this, there is every reason to believe that they have more secret agreements. There is already news that the United States has promised to assist Syngman Rhee with its naval and air forces when he re-launches the war.

The United States has made so many guarantees to Syngman Rhee and undertaken so many obligations. And Syngman Rhee? Pyun Yung-tai said yesterday with great ease: "We have not burdened ourselves with any obligations, so if the political conference fails, we will be free to take action."

It is clear that due to a series of U.S. appeasement and encouragement, Syngman Rhee has not only not given up his arrogant plan to sabotage the armistice and continue the war, but is increasingly confident that he can do so.

In this situation, whether the U.S. side can clearly guarantee that Syngman Rhee will abide by all the terms of the armistice agreement and related agreements is obviously a decisive issue for the future of peace in Korea. If the United States is unwilling to make Syngman Rhee's government and army unconditionally abide by the armistice agreement, then one cannot imagine how Syngman Rhee, who has always insisted on sabotaging the armistice, would be willing not to sabotage the armistice after the armistice agreement is signed, or abandon his plan to "unify Korea" by force when the political conference cannot achieve his goals. People also cannot imagine how the United States, which has always condoned Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice, could not allow Syngman Rhee to continue the war at that time. In fact, the Robertson-Syngman Rhee agreement has opened the door for Syngman Rhee to undermine the armistice. The seriousness of the problem lies here.

### 李承晚已公开宣称决不接受停战美方必须提出实施停战协定的明确保证

    李承晚已公开宣称决不接受停战美方必须提出实施停战协定的明确保证
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者江南报道：“美国政府准备拖延朝鲜停战到什么时候”——世界舆论有充分的理由提出这样的问题。因为自从双方代表团大会在十日复会以来，又是五天过去了。到今天为止，板门店还没有停战即将实现的迹象，这说明美方还没有能够就李承晚遵守停战协定提出明确的保证。
    由于李承晚集团已公开宣称决不接受停战，美方能否提出实施停战协定的确实保证是目前谈判有无进展的关键。可是从美国方面却正在放出越来越多的空气，说什么美国已经从李承晚那里取得了接受停战的保证，还说什么李承晚已经“作了重大的让步”。“纽约先驱论坛报”甚至大言不惭地说：联合国军方面“已对共方提出了适当的保证，即：协定一旦签字后，南朝鲜一定遵守。”这些宣传的唯一目的，显然是企图歪曲事实真相，为美方解脱拖延停战的责任。
    李承晚真的已经“作了重大的让步”，并且对接受停战作出了保证吗？我们且来看看事实罢。
    李承晚一贯反对停战，反对朝鲜停战协定，反对关于战俘遣返问题的协议。在罗伯逊和李承晚作了半个多月会谈之后，李承晚在他反对的这几方面有没有让步呢？没有！
    李承晚还是反对停战。在罗伯逊和李承晚的联合声明中，根本没有提到李承晚要接受停战。而李承晚在当天宣称，他并没有接受停战，只不过同意在九十天之内不进行阻挠而已。为了证明他这句话，李承晚昨天又在釜山发动了要求“北进”、“反对得不到统一的停战”的示威游行。
    李承晚仍然反对朝鲜停战协定。在李承晚和罗伯逊的联合声明中根本没有提到停战协定。李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰在昨天说，“我们的立场仍然是反对按照目前的停战条款缔结停战协定。”
    李承晚也仍然反对关于战俘问题的协议。在李承晚和罗伯逊的声明中，根本没有提到追回被李承晚强迫扣留的二万七千多名战俘的问题，反而企图以凡不直接遣返的人民军战俘都应在南朝鲜释放的片面说法来进一步阻挠战俘问题协议的实施，并且继续强迫扣留战俘。
    由此可见，李承晚并没有放弃他反对停战、破坏停战的狂妄主张。为了使他的野心计划能够实现，李承晚曾向美国提出了许多要求。现在，李承晚放弃了这些要求没有？或者如美国宣传机器所说的，他“作了让步”没有呢？也没有！非但没有，美国还给了李承晚许多他原来并没有要求的东西。
    在六月初，李承晚向美国提出的要求是：一、签订一项“共同防御条约”；二、美国增加对李承晚的经济上和军事上的援助；三、美国保证不阻止李承晚“统一朝鲜”的行动。对李承晚的这些要求，艾森豪威尔在六月七日向李承晚提出三点保证：一、用一切“和平方法”实现“统一朝鲜”；二、和李承晚谈判一项“共同防御条约”；三、继续给予李承晚经济援助。
    现在，经过了十几次会谈，罗伯逊给了李承晚什么东西呢？据美国的通讯社透露，罗伯逊答应了李承晚的事情是：一、答应签订“共同防御条约”；二、答应再装备李伪军四个师以达到二十个师的目标；三、答应给予大规模的军事援助和经济援助；四、答应不向李承晚追回已被强迫扣留的二万七千多名战俘；五、答应将政治会议限期为九十天；六、答应和李承晚在政治会议上采取一致态度，在政治会议上主张由联合国主持公民投票，如果政治会议在九十天之内不能达到李承晚的目的，美国就和李承晚一起退出政治会议，并“采取局势所需要的一切行动”。
    可见，罗伯逊所答应给李承晚的已经大大超过了李承晚所要求的东西，并且大大超过了艾森豪威尔所答应的东西。无怪乎卞荣泰得意洋洋地说，李承晚在与罗伯逊会谈中所得到的东西，比他们原先所希望的多“百分之六十”。实际上，多百分之一百也不止。
    非但如此。罗伯逊还在他的公事皮包里面装了一大叠李承晚开的账单，准备到华盛顿去支付的。已经透露出来的有三点：一、美国给予李承晚军事和经济援助的数量问题；二、退出政治会议的计划；三、“共同防御条约”的细节问题。
    是不是还有更多的协议呢？李承晚在罗伯逊离开朝鲜那天已经透露了一个，这就是他并没有接受停战，他只答应在九十天之内不阻挠停战。当时罗伯逊说：“这使我们简直无法忍受——我们曾有过协议。”罗伯逊宣称他和李承晚达成了“广泛的协议”，无疑这是上述六点协议之外最重要的协议。这个协议表明，美国政府同意了李承晚不受停战协定约束，同意他可以破坏停战。除此以外，人们完全有理由相信，他们还有更多的不可告人的秘密协议。已经有消息说，美国答应在李承晚重新发动战争时用海空军援助他。
    美国向李承晚作了这么多保证，承担了这么多义务。而李承晚呢？卞荣泰昨天浑身轻松地说：“我们并没有使我们自己担负什么义务，因此，要是政治会议一旦失败的话，我们将有采取行动的自由。”
    很明显，由于美方一连串的纵容和鼓励，李承晚非但没有放弃他的破坏停战、继续战争的狂妄计划，反而越来越觉得有把握这样干了。
    在这样情况下，美方是否能明确保证李承晚遵守停战协定一切条款和有关协议，对于朝鲜和平的前途显然是一个决定性的问题。如果美国不愿使李承晚的政府和军队无条件地遵守停战协定，那末，人们不能想像，一直坚持破坏停战的李承晚，如何肯在停战协定假使签字以后，不再破坏停战或在政治会议不能达到他的目的时，放弃他的武力“统一朝鲜”的计划。人们也不能想像，一直纵容李承晚破坏停战的美国，到那时候如何能不让李承晚继续战争。事实上，罗伯逊和李承晚的协议，已为李承晚破坏停战开放了大门。问题的严重性就在这里。
