Column: A Letter to Soldiers

    Editor's Note: Starting with this issue, the "The Motherland is Advancing" column will be changed to "A Letter to Soldiers." This column reports on the new atmosphere in national construction and people's lives by writing letters to the heroic soldiers, reports on the close friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the peaceful and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, reports on the prosperous and happy scenes of the peaceful and democratic countries, reports on the struggles of the people of all countries for peace, and reports on the people's concern and love for their army. Through this column, we will conduct patriotism and internationalism education for soldiers. We hope to receive the constant care and support of our readers and gradually improve this column.
    My dear comrades, let me tell you the truth. At this moment, I really wish I could grow two wings, fly to Korea, fly to you, and express my heartfelt love for you. I love you, and the people of the whole country love you—love your loyalty to the motherland, your righteousness to the people, and the noble contributions you have made to the cause of peace for all mankind.
    We yearn for peace and are striving for peace at all times. Now, a ceasefire has finally been achieved in Korea. Today, in every factory, every village, every school, every piece of land in the motherland, and even in every corner of the entire earth, people are laughing from their hearts and shouting from their hearts: "Peace has won its first victory!"
    This victory was won jointly by all peace-loving people around the world. But more importantly, it was you—our heroic Chinese People's Volunteers—who, shoulder to shoulder and back to back with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, directly inflicted countless heavy blows on the enemy, beating the enemy to the point where they could not hold on and had to accept our peace talks and had to sign the armistice agreement. You directly created this victory. Every laugh today is given to us by you—obtained by you with blood, sweat, and even the most precious lives of thousands of heroic soldiers among you!
    Who can forget your contributions! Who can forget the glorious actions you have shown on the road to peace! I still remember the winter of 1950, when you had just crossed the Yalu River. At that time, the sky was full of wind and snow, and the ground was covered with burning fires. You charged forward against the wind and snow, against the fire, and against the enemy's artillery fire. One night, on the road to Seoul, I personally saw a soldier whose feet were swollen from frostbite and could not put on his shoes. He simply didn't wear shoes, wrapped his feet in rotten cotton, tied them with rags, and gritted his teeth and limped along with the team. When the instructor saw that he was in so much pain, he asked him to go back, but he refused to go back, saying, "My heels are on the back, not on the front. I only know how to move forward, I don't know how to retreat."
    I also saw another soldier lying on a stretcher with shrapnel wounds. He was an anti-tank hero. When the enemy's tank charged up, he did not retreat a step, but stood up to meet the tank and threw a bunch of grenades. The tank was destroyed, and he was also injured. Afterwards, he said to people, "I felt that the motherland was right behind me. If the tank rushed past, it would crush our motherland. How could I let the tank rush behind me?"
    It is precisely because of this love for the motherland and for peace that you can be so brave and so strong; that you can display such great brilliance and create today's history.
    When I think of these things, I think of more and more. Your contributions to the cause of human peace will always be remembered by the people of the motherland, remembered by the Korean people, and remembered by every peace-loving person in the world. When I was still on the front line, I met a Korean officer named Kim. He shook my hand several times and said, "Thank you for the great friendship of the Chinese people, thank you for the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Our Korean people will never forget the goodness of the Volunteers for generations to come. In the future, we must erect a monument for the Volunteers, right here." As he spoke, he pointed to his heart. No! Not in the future, but right now, this monument has already been erected in the hearts of the Korean people.
    In the hearts of the people of the motherland, your image has long been transformed into a golden and brilliant statue, standing tall. Whether in factories, mines, or in rural areas or schools, whenever our people encounter difficulties, they will encourage each other and say, "The Volunteers are braving ice and snow on the Korean front line, and they are not afraid of any difficulties. What do our little difficulties count for?" Thinking of you, they have strength and want to do things well. You have become a driving force that can push workers to increase production, push farmers to produce more grain, and push students to get higher scores. They respect you and love you. I know there is such a thing: last winter, there was heavy snow in Beijing. A student thought that there must be heavy snow on the Korean front line, and he could not forget you in his dreams. He wondered how cold you must be in the tunnels and said to others, "I wish I could use my love for the Volunteers to warm their hearts!"
    Not long ago, I went to the great Northwest of the motherland. In the very distant Gobi Desert, you can hardly imagine what the situation is like there, but every worker who is mining oil there is thinking of you. They are thinking of your lives, thinking of your health. An old worker named Li Wenshu, who is in his fifties, has worked hard for many years and saved more than a dozen silver dollars, which he immediately took out and donated to the front. Li Wenshu still felt very sorry and said, "The money is really too little, I can't bear to give it away. But it's my little bit of heart, to buy our children some tobacco to smoke."
    It can be seen how much the people of the motherland love you and care for you. We love you because you yourselves are the symbol of victory and the embodiment of peace. Today, after more than two years of heroic and arduous battles, you have finally defeated the enemy together with the Korean People's Army and planted the flag of peace on the Korean battlefield.
    This is naturally a victory. But we should also know! The enemy is cunning, and the warmongers in the United States and the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique are unwilling to accept their defeat. They are still playing tricks and trying to undermine the first step of the peace you have won.
    This is something we must be fully vigilant about. We should continue to exert our strength to defend peace and consolidate and expand the existing victory. Let those war peddlers who dare to touch us fall in front of us like mud pigs and toads!

### 敬礼，英雄的志愿军

专栏：寄战士

    敬礼，英雄的志愿军
  　杨朔
    编者按：从本期起，“祖国在前进”专栏改为“寄战士”专栏。这一专栏是通过给英勇的战士们写信的形式，报道国家建设和人民生活中的新气象，报道中国人民和以苏联为首的和平民主国家人民的亲密友谊，报道和平民主国家的繁荣幸福的景象，报道各国人民争取和平的斗争，报道人民对自己的军队的关怀和热爱，通过这个专栏对战士进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育。我们希望得到读者的经常关心和支持，逐渐把这个专栏办好。
    我的亲爱的好同志们，说句心里话吧，在这一刻，我真希望能长出两只翅膀，飞到朝鲜，飞到你们跟前，向你们表示出我对你们衷心的爱戴。我爱你们，整个祖国的人民都爱你们——爱你们对祖国的忠，对人民的义，对全人类和平事业所做的高贵的贡献。
    我们渴望和平，时时刻刻都在争取和平，现在到底在朝鲜实现了停战。今天在祖国的每个工厂，每个农村，每个学校，每片土地上，甚而在整个地球的每个角落里，人民都从心里发出欢笑，从心里喊出句话：“和平取得了第一个胜利。”
    这次胜利，是全世界爱好和平的人民大家一齐争来的。可是更重要的，是你们——我们英雄的人民志愿军，在朝鲜战场上和朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军，肩并着肩，膀靠着膀，直接给敌人无数次巨大的打击，打的敌人支持不住，不得不接受我们的和平谈判，不得不在停战协定上签了字。胜利是你们直接创造的。今天的每一声欢笑，都是你们给我们的——是你们用血，用汗，甚至于用了你们中间千万个英雄战士最宝贵的生命争来的呀！
    谁能忘记你们的功绩！谁能忘记你们在争取和平的道路上所表现的光辉的行动！还记得一九五零年冬天，你们刚过鸭绿江，那时候漫天风雪，漫地是燃烧的大火，你们就冲着风雪，冲着火光，冲着敌人的炮火冲向前去。有一天晚上，在到汉城的路上，我亲眼看见一个战士，脚冻肿了，鞋子穿不上去，他索性不穿鞋，用烂棉花包着脚，用破布绑着脚，咬着牙一拐一拐跟着队伍走。指导员见他痛的不行，叫他回来，他可怎么也不肯回来，还说：“我的脚后跟长在后边，也不是长在前边，我只知道往前走，我不知道往后退。”
    我也见过另一个战士挂花了躺在担架上。他是一个反坦克英雄，在敌人的坦克冲上来时，他一步不退，迎着坦克站起来，扔出一束手榴弹。坦克炸坏了，他也受伤了。事后他对人说：“我觉得祖国就在我的背后，要是坦克冲过去，就碾到我们祖国身上去了。我怎能让坦克冲到我的背后去呢？”
    正是由于这种对祖国对和平的热爱，你们才能那样勇敢，那样坚强；才能发挥出那样大的光芒，创造出今天的历史。
    我想起这些，我想到的更多更多。你们对人类和平事业的贡献将永远为祖国人民记着，为朝鲜人民记着，为全世界每个爱好和平的人民记着。还在前线时，我认识一位姓金的朝鲜校官，他好几次握着我的手说：“感谢中国人民伟大的友谊，感谢中国人民志愿军伟大的国际主义精神。我们朝鲜人民子子孙孙千秋万代永世也忘不了志愿军的好处。将来我们一定要替志愿军立块碑，就立在这儿。”说着，他指一指他的心窝。不！不是在将来，而是就在现在，这块碑早在朝鲜人民的心里立起来了。
    在祖国人民的心坎上，你们的形象也早变成一座金光灿烂的塑像，高高地竖起来了。不论是在工厂里，矿山上，也不论在农村里，学校里，只要我们的人民一遇到困难，他们就会互相鼓励说：“人家志愿军在朝鲜前线爬冰卧雪的，天大的困难都不怕，咱这点困难又算什么？”想起你们，他们就有了力量，就要把事情做好。你们已经变成一种动力，可以推动工人增加产量，推动农民多打粮食，也可以推动学生多考分数。他们敬你们，也爱你们。我知道有这样件事情：去年冬天北京下大雪，一个学生想起朝鲜前线一定也飘大雪了，睡里梦里也念念不忘你们，不知你们在坑道里多么冷呢，还对人说：“但愿我能用我对志愿军的热爱，去温暖温暖他们的心吧！”
    不久以前我到祖国的大西北去了一趟。在很远很远的戈壁滩上，你们想也不容易想得出那边是怎样的情形，可是每个在那边开采石油的工人都惦着你们。他们惦着你们的生活，惦着你们的身体。一个叫李文书的老工人五十多岁了，多年辛辛苦苦积攒了十几块白洋，一下子都拿出来捐给了前方。李文书还觉得怪过意不去说：“钱实在太少了，拿不出手来。多少总是我的一点心意，给咱们孩子买口黄烟抽吧。”
    可见祖国人民对你们是怎样地爱，怎样地关怀。我们爱你们，因为你们本身就是胜利的标志，就是和平的化身。到今天，经过两年多英雄的艰苦的战斗，你们到底和朝鲜人民军一起打败了敌人，把和平的旗子插到朝鲜战场上了。
    这自然是个胜利。可是，我们也该知道啊！敌人是狡猾的，美国的好战分子和李承晚反动集团，是不甘心他们的这场失败的，他们还在玩弄阴谋诡计，想破坏你们争得的和平的第一步。
    这是我们必须充分加以警惕的，我们应该继续发挥我们保卫和平的力量，巩固和扩大现有的胜利。让那些敢于碰我们的战争贩子像泥猪癞狗般地在我们面前倒下去吧！
