    International Adventures and the Defense of Peace
    Observer of the Soviet "Pravda"
    After the foreign mercenary elements' provocative actions in Berlin met with a shameful defeat, the American bourgeois newspapers, with the help of some British newspapers, started a smear campaign, trying to make as much of this adventure as possible. The reactionary newspapers of the United States openly demanded that the instigators of the fascist atrocities of June 17th conduct this kind of "experiment" again in the German Democratic Republic, and carry out this kind of "experiment" in other people's democratic countries.

    Some American political leaders and politicians enthusiastically participated in this provocative agitation. American Senators Humphrey, Ferguson, Mansfield, Monroney, and Wiley, in their loud and sensational speeches, suggested that the government immediately and with all possible means take advantage of the "valuable opportunity" that the Berlin provocation supposedly gave the United States. Senator Monroney advocated intensifying sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, saying: The United States should rub salt in the wound, regardless of where the wound is. Senator Wiley, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Dulles' policy aimed at large-scale organization of sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. He was so brazen as to come up with an absurd "demand" that he believed the United States should make to the Soviet Union.

    But it was not only the American bourgeois newspapers that were issuing provocative cries, but also those members of Congress who, although ignorant, were determined to invade. There is little difference between the remarks of American politicians and this kind of outcry. Secretary of State Dulles openly expressed his support for the newspapers' and Congress's slanderous lies and provocative remarks, and US President Eisenhower followed suit. On the one hand, Dulles openly advocated intensifying American sabotage activities against countries in the peace-loving democratic camp; on the other hand, Eisenhower used vague terms to conceal his clamor for blatant interference in the affairs of other countries. These two people naively underestimated the fact that all of this can easily be used to refute them, refute all those who incite riots, panic, and aggression.

    What are the reasons for the American newspapers' provocations, the American congressmen's defamatory and inflammatory speeches, and the politicians' speeches advocating strengthening American interference in democratic countries?

    Obviously, this is primarily due to the anxiety of the American rulers about the failure of their foreign policy - the notorious "policy of strength." Dulles' much-touted hard-line policy, aimed at unconditionally subordinating Western European countries to American leadership and isolating the Soviet Union, has suffered a disastrous defeat. Even some American bourgeois newspapers now openly admit this. Everyone knows that Dulles' ultimatum to Western European countries, limiting them to sign the "European Defense Community" treaty within seventy-five days - which this American Secretary of State brought with him during his first visit to Europe at the end of January and the beginning of February - has been rejected. The United States' attempt to blackmail the governments of Western European countries with the promise of so-called "foreign aid" funds has backfired. Some European countries refused this "aid," and some countries demanded that trade restrictions be relaxed instead of "aid," which American monopoly capital was unwilling to agree to. Dulles also failed to eliminate the differences between Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, in their Far East policy. In other words, not only has the policy of Western European countries not been subordinated to the interests of the United States, but we have instead seen greater friction between them. The cracks within the Anglo-American bloc are deepening.

    More importantly, all diplomatic attempts by the United States to isolate the Soviet Union have clearly been completely defeated. The Soviet government's statement in mid-March that there are currently no unresolved or unresolved issues that cannot be peacefully resolved on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned has been well received by the broadest sections of people in all countries. The Soviet initiative has even been well received among the ruling groups in Britain, France and other countries. The movement to resolve international disputes through consultation has spread widely in various places, so that the leaders of the American government, fearing their own isolation, also felt it necessary to express something about the Soviet initiative.

    In a speech to the American Newspaper Editors Association on April 16th, the US President said that the United States "is prepared to play the role it should play" in resolving international issues. However, it was at this point that Eisenhower hastily proposed some preconditions to the Soviet Union, which he believed should be fulfilled before the disputed issues could be resolved. In other words, the American ruling group is demanding major concessions from others, just to get them to agree to hold negotiations.

    The strategy of proposing so-called "preconditions" adopted by the American ruling group out of fear of the increasingly high tide of people in various countries demanding peace and demanding that governments conduct consultations has aroused condemnation from the broadest strata of people in various countries and politicians and political leaders in some Western European and Asian countries. The leaders of these countries are well aware that the continuation of international tensions will make these countries more economically and politically dependent on the United States, so they finally no longer hide their willingness to discuss resolving international problems.

    This desire is most clearly expressed in the well-known speech by British Prime Minister Churchill, in which he advocated consultations between major powers without mentioning any preconditions. As everyone knows, Churchill's initiative was widely welcomed. And as we have seen in the American newspapers, this speech has only aroused disappointment and hostile comments in Washington.

    It is now clear that there are serious differences between the United States and its main European partners on important international issues. Apparently, President Eisenhower suggested that the leaders of the British and French governments go to Bermuda to hold a meeting with him in the hope of resolving these differences and formulating a common policy to deal with the Soviet Union.

    The Bermuda conference, originally scheduled to be held in mid-June, has been postponed repeatedly. Now, due to Churchill's illness, many people doubt whether the conference will be held. According to American newspapers, the news that the plan to convene the conference failed to materialize reassured Washington, although everyone knows that the proposal to hold the conference was made by the American government. What is going on? This is because the differences between the United States, Britain, and France have developed to the point where they cannot be eliminated by a new meeting of government leaders.

    The meeting of heads of government did not take place, but the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France are to hold a meeting in Washington. The goals set for this meeting in resolving the differences between the Western partners are even more limited. From the news in the newspapers about the agenda of this meeting, there are many disputes among them. What is enough to illustrate the problem is that American diplomats hope to discuss the internal affairs of their European partners, which naturally aroused dissatisfaction from Britain and France. At the same time, the American ruling group, under the guise of establishing a "unified anti-Moscow front," is trying to disregard the fundamental national interests of Western European countries and completely control their foreign policy.

    This ambition has been opposed and continues to be opposed even by the ruling groups in Western Europe. In order to subdue their opposition, American diplomats are increasingly resorting to blackmail, threatening to stop "aid" and applying various political and economic pressures.

    At the same time, American diplomats are frantically spreading fabricated propaganda about the "Soviet threat," attempting to scare their allies. In this regard, the words of the American "Monthly Review" magazine are noteworthy. "Monthly Review" recently said that the Soviet Union's peace policy has caused panic among the American ruling group" because "what is most problematic now is the rule of their 'free world' (as everyone knows, the American propaganda machine deceptively calls the countries of the North Atlantic aggressive group the 'free world')." The magazine emphasized that the United States has consistently clamored about the "Soviet threat," attempting to prevent divisions in its camp. The American magazine wrote: "This so-called threat, carefully manufactured and propagandized using all modern communication technologies and high-pressure sales methods, has always been the cement that holds the US-led alliance together. If the people of the 'free world' at some point no longer believe in the existence of this threat, the political foundation of this alliance will disintegrate, and the entire framework of the American ruling class's policy will be in danger of collapse."

    Based on these explanations, it is possible to understand why so many new provocations organized by the American authorities have recently occurred, provocations that are obviously intended to further deteriorate the international situation.

    On the other hand, when organizing provocations such as the Berlin adventure, the American authorities attempted to show their allies that Dulles' so-called "hard-line" policy has begun to take effect. American diplomats are trying to convince their Western European partners that when dealing with the Soviet Union, adventurous actions and provocations, sabotage and subversion will prove more effective than peaceful negotiations.

    The failure of the foreign mercenaries' adventure in Berlin did not sober up the minds of their instigators. They are still talking about the need to provoke new riots in the German Democratic Republic and spread them to the people's democratic countries, while using these bandits and provocateurs to intensify pressure on the Soviet Union. How little and how incorrectly they understand the Soviet Union!

    It is difficult to determine which of the following two possibilities plays a major role: is it the brazenness that characterizes adventurers, or is it stupidity. One thing is clear: the people who formulated this plan completely failed to take into account the balance of power on the international stage. They have not seen that the Soviet Union's peace policy is receiving increasingly broad support around the world, while the American aggressive group's adventurous policy has been universally condemned, and even their Western European partners do not support it.

    Experience has proven that treating truly independent and peace-loving countries with a policy of domination will only bring failure to the formulators of this policy. British Prime Minister Churchill has apparently estimated this point, and in his well-known speech, he strongly advocated resolving international disputes immediately through consultation without proposing any preconditions to any country.

    As everyone knows, "Pravda" expressed its sincerity in its article on Churchill's speech because he did not propose any preconditions. "Pravda" also reminded them not to make fundamental mistakes, believing that in the current international situation, one party can propose preconditions to the other party, and especially to a party like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for reaching an agreement on international issues.

    The American ruling group has ignored this basic and fair requirement. They stick to their methods, creating the Berlin adventure in the center of Europe at one time, and instigating Syngman Rhee to take provocative actions in Korea at another time, and perhaps are preparing to take new adventures and provocative actions.

    The foolish believers in the "policy of strength" seem to believe that by instigating the agents they hire to take adventurous and provocative actions, or by launching a noisy campaign around provocative events by the American propaganda machine, they can more easily achieve their aggressive goals, or at least they can continue the international tension they have created themselves. Everyone who understands reason understands that this is a short-sighted plan that is doomed to failure.

    The Soviet Union has clearly expressed its sincerity in resolving international disputes. In the thirty-five years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, has anyone not known that the Soviet Union's international status has been greatly consolidated? The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are the truly powerful pillars of world peace.

    This shocked the imperialist camp, especially its aggressive group.

    They are preparing to create new adventures and provocations, and launch newspapers to conduct new propaganda around this point, attempting to hinder the easing of international tensions. However, this not only does not mean the consolidation of their position, but on the contrary. This makes the aforementioned aggressive group increasingly isolated internationally.

    As for the organizers of this comprehensive propaganda campaign, which shows obvious contempt for the people's efforts to strive for peace, their policies will lead them into a more difficult situation to escape.

    国际冒险行动与保卫和平
    苏联“真理报”观察家
    外国雇佣分子在柏林发动的挑衅行动遭到了可耻的失败以后，美国的资产阶级报纸在一部分英国报纸的帮腔下，开始了一阵大吵大嚷的诬蔑，尽量在这次冒险事件上做文章。美国的反动报纸公开要求六月十七日法西斯暴行的策动者在德意志民主共和国再来一次这种“试验”，而且在其他人民民主国家来进行这种“试验”。
    美国的一些政界领袖与政治家起劲地参加了这一阵挑衅性的煽动。美国参议员汉弗莱、福格森、曼斯菲尔德、蒙特、维利在他们的大吵大嚷的危言耸听的演说中，建议政府立刻并且尽一切可能来利用据说是柏林挑衅事件给予美国的“宝贵机会”。参议员蒙特主张加紧进行反对苏联和其他爱好和平国家的破坏活动，他说：美国应该在伤口上擦盐，不要管伤口是在甚么地方。参议院外交委员会主席维利称赞杜勒斯的旨在大规模组织反对苏联和各人民民主国家的破坏活动的政策，他竟厚颜无耻到了这样的地步，拟出了一个认为美国应该向苏联提出的荒谬的“要求”。
    但是发出挑衅叫嚣的不仅是美国资产阶级报纸，那些虽然无知，但一心想侵略的国会议员也在这样叫嚣。美国政治家的言论和这种叫嚣很少差别。国务卿杜勒斯公开表示他支持报纸和国会的诬蔑性的谎话和挑衅言论，美国总统艾森豪威尔继他之后也有这种表示。一方面杜勒斯公开主张加紧美国反对爱好和平的民主阵营国家的破坏活动；另一方面，艾森豪威尔又利用含糊的辞句来掩饰他的主张横蛮干涉其他国家事务的叫嚣。这两个人天真地过低估计了这一事实，就是：所有这些都能很容易地被用来驳斥他们，驳斥所有那些骚乱、恐慌和侵略的煽动者。
    美国报纸进行挑衅、美国国会议员发表诬蔑和煽动的演说、政治家发表鼓吹加强美国对民主国家的干涉的演说等等的原因何在呢？
    显然，这首先是由于美国统治者因为他们的外交政策——臭名远扬的“实力政策”——的失败感到忧虑。杜勒斯提出的被大肆鼓吹的旨在使西欧国家无条件地从属于美国领导，旨在孤立苏联的强硬政策，已遭到惨败。甚至一部分美国资产阶级报纸现在也公开承认了这一点。大家知道，杜勒斯向西欧国家提出的，限它们在七十五天内签订“欧洲防务集团”条约的最后通牒——这是一月底二月初这位美国国务卿第一次访问欧洲时带去的——已被拒绝。美国打算以所谓“援外”拨款的诺言来讹诈西欧国家政府的企图，反而使自己吃了亏。某些欧洲国家拒绝这种“援助”，有些国家要求以放宽贸易限制来代替“援助”，而这是美国垄断资本所不愿同意的。杜勒斯也没有能够消除西方国家，特别是美国与英国在远东政策方面的分歧。换句话说，不但西欧国家的政策没有从属美国的利益，我们反而看到它们之间的磨擦更加厉害了。英美集团内部的裂痕正日益加深。
    更重要的是，美国，想孤立苏联的一切外交企图显然已经遭到彻底的失败。苏联政府三月中旬所发表的声明说：目前没有任何争执不下的或未获解决的问题不能在有关国家的相互协议的基础上求得和平解决，苏联政府的声明得到世界各国最广泛的人士的良好反应。苏联的倡议甚至在英国、法国和其它国家统治集团中间也得到了良好的反应。要求以协商方式来解决争执中的国际问题的运动已在各地广泛展开，以致美国政府的领袖们由于担心自己陷于孤立，也认为有必要对苏联的倡议有所表示了。
    四月十六日美国总统在美国报纸编辑协会发表的演说中说：在解决国际问题的时候，美国“准备担任它应当担任的角色”。可是，也正是在这一点上，艾森豪威尔又仓促向苏联提出了一些先决条件，他认为应该先履行这些条件，然后再解决争执中的问题。换句话说，美国统治集团要求别人作重大的让步，仅仅为了求得他们答应举行谈判。
    美国统治集团由于惧怕各国人民要求和平、要求各国政府进行协商的愈来愈高涨的运动，而采取的提出所谓“先决条件”的策略，已经引起了各国最广泛阶层的人民和西欧及亚洲一些国家的政治家和政界领袖的谴责。这些国家的领袖们非常了解国际紧张局势继续下去会使这些国家在经济上和政治上更加依赖美国，因此他们终于不再隐瞒他们愿意讨论解决国际问题的愿望了。
        这一愿望最明晰地表现在英国首相邱吉尔的众所周知的演说中，他在演说中主张大国间进行协商，而不提任何先决条件。大家知道，邱吉尔的倡议受到了普遍的欢迎。又正如我们在美国报纸上所看到的，也只有在华盛顿，这篇演说才引起了失望和敌对的评论。
    现在已经很明显，美国和他们的主要欧洲伙计间在重要的国际问题上存在着严重的分歧。显然，艾森豪威尔总统是为了希望解决这些分歧，并拟定一个对付苏联的共同政策才建议英、法政府的领袖到百慕大去与他举行会议的。
        原来定于六月中旬举行的百慕大会议一再延期。现在，由于邱吉尔患病，许多人怀疑这次会议是否还会举行。据美国报纸报道，关于召开这次会议的计划未能实行的消息使华盛顿安心了，虽然，大家都知道，举行会议的建议是美国政府提出的。这是怎么一回事呢？这是因为美国、英国和法国的分歧已经发展到不能以政府领袖的新会议的方式来消除的地步了。
    政府首脑的会议没有举行，美、英、法的外长却要在华盛顿举行会议。这次会议所定的在解决西方伙计们之间的分歧方面的目标更加有限。从报纸关于这次会议议程的消息看来，它们中间有许多争执的问题。足以说明问题的就是美国外交家希望讨论关于他们的欧洲伙计的内政问题，这自然引起了英国和法国的不满。同时，美国统治集团在建立一个“反莫斯科统一战线”的幌子下，企图不顾西欧国家根本的民族利益，全部控制它们的外交政策。
    这种野心受到了并继续受到甚至西欧统治集团的反对。为了压服他们的反对，美国外交家一天比一天厉害地采取讹诈手段，扬言要停止“援助”并施用各种政治和经济压力。
    同时，美国外交家疯狂地散布无中生有的“苏维埃威胁”的宣传，企图恐吓它的盟国。关于这一点，美国“每月评论”杂志的话值得注意。“每月评论”最近说，苏联的和平政策在美国统治集团中引起了恐慌”，因为“现在最成问题的正是他们的‘自由世界’（大家都知道，美国宣传机关骗人地把北大西洋侵略集团的国家叫做‘自由世界’）的统治权”。杂志着重指出，美国一贯地叫嚷着“苏维埃威胁”，企图防止它的阵营的分歧。美国杂志写道：“用一切现代通讯技术和高压销售方法细心制造出来并加以宣传的这种所谓威胁一直就是把以美国为首的同盟凑合起来的水泥。如果‘自由世界’的人民在某一个时候不相信这种威胁的存在了，这个同盟的政治基础就会瓦解，美国统治阶级的政策的整个架子就有崩溃的危险。”
    根据这些解释，就可以明白最近为什么发生了美国当局所组织的这样多新的挑衅、显然是以使国际局势进一步恶化的挑衅。
    另一方面，在组织像柏林的冒险行动这样的挑衅时，美国当局企图向他们的同盟者表明，杜勒斯的所谓“强硬”政策已开始生效。美国外交家企图使他们的西欧伙计们相信，在对付苏联时，冒险行动和挑衅、破坏和颠覆活动将证明比和平谈判更有效。
    外国雇佣分子在柏林冒险行动的失败并没有使它们的煽动者的头脑清醒过来。他们现在还在谈什么需要在德意志民主共和国挑起新的骚乱并使它们蔓延到人民民主国家去，同时利用这些匪徒和挑衅者来加紧对苏联施以压力。他们对苏联的了解是多么少、多么不正确啊！
    很难以确定下面这两个可能性是哪一个占主要地位：是作为冒险分子的特征的厚颜无耻呢，还是愚蠢。有一点是清楚的：制订这种计划的人们完全没有考虑到国际舞台上的力量的对比。他们没有看到苏联的和平政策在全世界得到日益广泛的支持，而美国侵略集团的冒险政策已遭到普遍的谴责，甚至他们的西欧伙计们也不予以支持。
    经验证明，用支配政策对待真正独立的和爱好和平的国家只会给这个政策的制订者带来失败。英国的邱吉尔首相显然就估计到了这一点，他在他的大家都知道的演说中极力主张立即通过协商方式解决国际分歧，而不对任何国家提出任何先决条件。
    大家都知道，“真理报”在它的关于邱吉尔演说的文章中对这个倡议表示了诚意，就正是因为他没有提出任何先决条件。“真理报”还提醒他们不要犯根本性的错误，认为在目前的国际局势中一方可以向另一方、而且是向像苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟这样的一方提出就国际问题取得协议的先决条件。
    美国的统治集团却忽视这个基本的和公正的要求。他们固执他们的作法，一时在欧洲中心制造了柏林冒险行动，一时又在朝鲜教唆李承晚采取挑衅行动并且也许还在准备采取新的冒险和挑衅行动。
        “实力政策”的愚蠢的迷信者似乎认为，他们教唆他们所雇用的特务采取冒险和挑衅行动，或是叫美国的宣传机关围绕着挑衅事件发动一阵吵吵嚷嚷，就可以比较容易地达到他们的侵略目的，或者至少可以使他们自己造成的国际紧张局势继续下去。每一个懂道理的人都了解，这是短视的计划，是注定要失败的。
    苏联已经很清楚地表示了它的解决国际争端的诚意。在苏维埃政权建立后的三十五年中，苏联的国际地位已经大大巩固了，难道还有人不知道吗？苏联和中华人民共和国及人民民主国家是世界和平的真正强大支柱。
    这使帝国主义阵营特别是它的侵略集团震惊。
    他们准备制造新的冒险和挑衅，并且发动报纸围绕这点进行新的宣传，企图阻碍国际紧张局势的缓和。然而这不仅不意味着他们的地位的巩固，而正相反。这使得上述侵略集团在国际上越来越孤立。
    至于对人民争取和平的努力表现明显轻蔑的这一全盘宣传运动的组织者，他们的政策将使他们陷入更难脱身的绝境。
