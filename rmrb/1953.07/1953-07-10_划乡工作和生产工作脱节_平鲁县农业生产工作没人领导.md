The delineation of townships in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, has become disconnected from production work, and the agricultural production work in most villages has fallen into a serious state of being without leadership.

From May 24th, after the main cadres of the county, districts, and villages went to the county for a meeting, the county leadership organs did not understand the production situation at all until mid-June. There are a total of 205 administrative villages in the county. Except for the 101 administrative villages that are undergoing township delineation work, the remaining 104 administrative villages (including five townships and twelve administrative villages that have already been delineated) have at most six cadres in each district to lead production, or even only one person. This has greatly weakened the leadership of production work. There are 58 villages in the fifth district. Except for the 29 villages that are undergoing township delineation, the remaining 29 villages have only one cultural and educational assistant to lead production. There are only two cadres leading production in the seventh district. Whether the cadres from the county go to the countryside or the cadres from the district go to the countryside, few of them are leading production work. Originally, the delineation of townships should be completed while doing a good job in local production work, but some production and township delineation work groups do not do that after arriving in the village. The production and township delineation work group in Yuandun Village, sixth district, has nothing to do during the day, and does not mention production work in the evening meetings. Li Xigou Village, fifth district, reported to the district that hailstones more than three inches thick fell on June 5th, damaging more than 380 mu of crops; nearly ten days after this incident occurred, the district leading organs have not yet clarified the actual situation. In some villages in the sixth district, impoverished households were still unable to plant their land by mid-June. The district leading organs have repeatedly requested the county to send cadres to lead production, but the county has not been able to solve this problem because it has no cadres to send. At present, insect pests have occurred in some areas, and animal epidemics have also begun to spread, but because there are no cadres to lead, they cannot be extinguished in time.

### 划乡工作和生产工作脱节  平鲁县农业生产工作没人领导

    划乡工作和生产工作脱节
    平鲁县农业生产工作没人领导
    山西省平鲁县因划乡工作和领导生产脱了节，多数村庄的农业生产工作已陷于无人负责领导的严重状态。
    从五月二十四日起，县、区、村主要干部到县开会后，到六月中旬县领导机关连一点生产情况都不了解。全县共有二百零五个行政村，除一百零一个行政村正在进行划乡工作外，剩下的一百零四个行政村（包括已划过乡的五个乡、一十二个行政村在内）领导生产的干部各区顶多只有六个人，甚至只有一个人，这样就大大地减弱了对生产工作的领导。五区共有五十八个村，除了正在进行划乡的二十九个村外，其余二十九个村只有一个文教助理员领导生产。七区也只有两个干部领导生产。不论县里的干部下乡也好，区里的干部下乡也好，但都很少有人领导生产工作。本来应该是在搞好当地生产工作的情况下去完成划乡工作，可是有的生产划乡工作组到村后，就不那样去做。六区元墩村生产划乡工作组白天没有事情做，晚上开会也不提生产工作。五区李西沟村向区报告六月五日下冰雹三寸多厚，打坏庄稼三百八十多亩；这件事情发生将近十天了，区领导机关还没有弄清楚实际情况。六区有的村子的困难户到六月中旬还种不上地。区领导机关几次要求县里派干部领导生产，可是县里因为没有干部可派，到现在这个问题也没有解决。目前有些地区虫害又已发生，畜疫也开始蔓延起来了，但是因为没有干部去领导，不能及时扑灭。
