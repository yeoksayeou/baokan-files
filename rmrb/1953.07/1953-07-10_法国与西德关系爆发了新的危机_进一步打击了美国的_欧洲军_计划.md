Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, Paris dispatch: A new crisis has recently erupted in Franco-West German relations, making the U.S.'s European Army plan even more difficult to realize.

When the West German Federal Parliament discussed and approved the agreement signed in London in February this year regarding the repayment of post-war economic aid given to West Germany by the United States, Britain, and France, it uniquely refused to approve the repayment of $11.8 million owed to France. On the same day, the Federal Parliament also passed another resolution on the long-disputed Saar issue between France and West Germany, demanding that France hand over the Saar to West Germany. During the discussion of these two resolutions, members of the West German Federal Parliament made fierce revanchist and anti-French remarks.

The West German Federal Parliament's arrogant actions aroused anger among the French public. Right-wing newspapers representing the interests of the French bourgeoisie also published commentaries, strongly condemning it. The "Aurore" commented on the 3rd: This move by West Germany "is shameless and intolerable." "Aurore" said:
	"During the nearly five years that German troops occupied France, they inflicted all kinds of terror on the French people. They plundered France every day... and they dare to insult us today." "Le Figaro" said: "As long as there is a modicum of shame and the simplest sense of honor, members of the Federal Parliament should not have made such remarks." "Les Echos", the mouthpiece of French industry, said: "This will further worsen Franco-German relations."

West German "Chancellor" Adenauer, fearing that he had gone too far, had the Federal Parliament cancel its decision of the previous day on the 3rd and approve the repayment of the debt to France. However, according to Reuters, French diplomats pointed out: "The strong anti-German sentiment caused in France by Germany's earlier rejection of the debt repayment agreement is difficult to eliminate."

The deepening of the contradiction between France and West Germany is further undermining the "European Army" plan aimed at arming West Germany. In another dispatch, Reuters quoted French diplomats as saying that West Germany's move "will certainly hinder Franco-German relations and make France more opposed to the European Army Treaty." The U.S. Associated Press issued a telegram from Bonn on the 2nd, expressing concern about the impact of this incident, saying: This incident "may be a fatal blow to the European Army Treaty, which has long been on shaky ground, to the point that even among its most enthusiastic supporters, some have given up hope."

### 法国与西德关系爆发了新的危机  进一步打击了美国的“欧洲军”计划

    法国与西德关系爆发了新的危机
    进一步打击了美国的“欧洲军”计划
    【新华社九日讯】巴黎消息：最近法国与西德关系爆发了新的危机，使得美国的欧洲军计划更加难以实现。
    西德联邦议院二日在讨论批准今年二月在伦敦签订的关于偿还战后美、英、法三国给予西德的战后经济援款的协定时，独拒绝批准偿还亏欠法国的一千一百八十万美元。同一天，联邦议院还在法国与西德争执已久的萨尔问题上通过了另一项决议，要求法国把萨尔交给西德。在讨论这两项决议的过程中，西德联邦议院的议员们发表了激烈的复仇主义的反法言论。
    西德联邦议院的嚣张行动，激起法国公众的愤怒。代表法国资产阶级利益的右翼报纸也发表评论，痛加斥责。“震旦报”三日评论说：西德的这种举动“是不顾羞耻的，不能容忍的”。“震旦报”说：
    “在德国军队占领法国的将近五年的时间里，他们对法国人民施行了一切恐怖手段。他们每天都在掠夺法国……而他们今天竟敢侮辱我们。”“费加罗报”说：“只要有最起码的羞耻感与最简单的荣誉感，联邦议院的议员就应该不致发表这样的言论。”法国工业界的喉舌“回声报”说：“这将使法德关系更加恶化。”
    西德“总理”阿登纳担心做得太过分，在三日使联邦议院取消了前一天的决定并批准偿还法国的债务。但是，据路透社报道，法国外交人士指出：“法国对德国早先否决偿债协定一举所引起的强烈反德情绪，是很难消除的。”
    法国和西德矛盾的加深进一步打击着以武装西德为目的的“欧洲军”计划。路透社在另一条消息中引法国外交人士的话说：西德的举动“肯定地将妨害法德关系并使法国更加反对欧洲军条约”。美国的美联社二日从波恩发出电讯，对这次事件的影响表示忧虑说：这次事件“可能是对欧洲军条约的致命打击，这个条约长期以来基础就不稳固，以至于在它的最热心的支持者中间也有人放弃了希望”。
