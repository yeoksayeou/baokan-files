    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. The "Pravda" published on the 8th a commentary by V. Koryonov entitled "Who is Responsible for Provocative Actions?"
    The commentary exposed the attempts of the American reactionary group to shirk its responsibility for the provocative actions in Korea and Berlin. The commentary used powerful facts and logic to show that the American reactionary group cannot shirk its responsibility. The commentary said: "The Syngman Rhee gang is indeed afraid of the armistice, as afraid as of fire. This is understandable, because it can only maintain its regime because of the war, only because of the support of the American troops who broke into Korea to carry out the war of aggression. Who could truly believe, even for a minute, that the actual power in South Korea seems to be in the hands of this small group of puppets, and not in the hands of the American military command that calls itself the 'United Nations Command Headquarters'? Who can believe that the poor mercenary Syngman Rhee would allow himself to forcibly drive 27,000 prisoners of war out of the prisoner-of-war camps in order to further drive them into his own barracks, if the American military authorities controlling these prisoners of war opposed his actions? Who can believe that American generals and diplomats seem 'powerless' to calm down the presumptuous adventurers?" The commentary pointed out: The American command has announced more than once that it commands the army, navy, and air force in South Korea. The whole world knows that the South Korean puppet order is completely supported by the Americans, and now the American propaganda cannot deal with Syngman Rhee. This is a clumsy deception. The commentary pointed out: The "diplomatic negotiations" between the United States and this deadly enemy of the Korean people and a loyal pawn of the United States are a "despicable farce." The commentary said: "High-ranking representatives of the American military and government flew to him one after another. They pretended to be trying to persuade Syngman Rhee, but they could not persuade him." The commentary pointed out: "The American press revealed the fact that Robertson, the personal representative of the American president, and Syngman Rhee discussed plans to undermine the political conference that should be held after the conclusion of the armistice agreement and to resume military operations during the 'negotiations'." The commentary emphasized: "The clumsy attempts by the American aggressor groups to shirk their responsibility for their premeditated sabotage of the Korean armistice can only deceive those who are willing to be deceived." The commentary then proved that the American reactionary group cannot shirk its responsibility for the provocative actions in Berlin either. The commentary pointed out that those who hypocritically talk about peace while in fact spreading the seeds of military adventures and provocations are inevitably exposed as enemies of international peace and security.

    苏联“真理报”发表维·科里奥诺夫的评论指出
    美国推卸不了在朝鲜和柏林挑衅的责任
    【新华社莫斯科八日电】“真理报”八日发表了维·科里奥诺夫以“谁对挑衅行动负责？”为题的评论。
    评论揭发了美国反动集团推卸它在朝鲜和柏林的挑衅行动的责任的企图，评论以有力的事实和逻辑说明美国反动集团是推卸不了责任的。评论说：“李承晚匪帮的确害怕停战，像害怕火一样。这是可以理解的，因为它之能保持政权，只是由于战争，只是由于闯入朝鲜来进行侵略战争的美国军队的支持。谁能够那怕一分钟真正相信，南朝鲜的实际政权似乎在这一小伙傀儡手里，而不在自称为“联合国军总司令部”的美国军事指挥部手里呢？谁能够相信，可怜的雇佣分子李承晚会自己允许强把二万七千战俘赶出战俘营以便进一步把他们赶到自己的兵营，如果控制着这些战俘的美国军事当局反对他的行动的话？谁能够相信，美国将军和外交官似乎‘无力’使放肆的冒险分子安静下来？”评论指出：美国指挥部不止一次宣布它指挥着在南朝鲜的陆海空军，全世界知道南朝鲜傀儡秩序完全靠美国人支持，而现在美方宣传对付不了李承晚，这是一个笨拙的骗局。评论指出：美国同这个朝鲜人民死敌、美国忠实走卒的“外交谈判”是“卑鄙滑稽剧”。评论说：“美国军部和政府的高级代表一个又一个飞到他那里去。他们装做似乎去说服但是说服不了李承晚的样子”。评论指出：“美国报刊泄露这样的事实，美国总统私人代表罗伯逊和李承晚在‘谈判’过程中讨论破坏在停战协定缔结之后应该召开的政治会议并且恢复军事行动的计划。”评论强调说：“美国侵略集团推卸他们预谋的破坏朝鲜停战的责任的笨拙企图，只能欺骗那些愿意受骗的人。”评论接着证明美国反动集团也不能推卸掉在柏林的挑衅行动的责任。评论指出：那种虚伪地谈论和平而事实上在散布军事冒险和挑衅种子的人，不可避免地被揭露是国际和平和安全的敌人。
