    Urgent Notice from the North China Labor Bureau and Trade Union
    Pay Attention to Protecting Workers' Health in Summer
    The North China Administrative Committee Labor Bureau and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions North China Working Committee jointly issued an urgent notice on July 18 to all factories, mines, and construction sites in the region regarding summer protection of workers' health and improvement of working conditions.
    Since July 7, the climate in the North China region has suddenly turned hot, with temperatures in many factory's high-temperature workshops exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei Province, and Shanxi Province, many factories and construction sites have continuously experienced incidents of workers suffering from heatstroke and fainting in recent days. Some units have had to shorten or temporarily stop their machines, directly affecting the completion of production tasks. For example, the construction site of the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory stopped work for two hours on the afternoon of the 8th; after the 7th, the production plans of various workshops of the Tianjin Steel Plant could not be completed every day.
    In light of this situation, the North China Administrative Committee Labor Bureau and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions North China Working Committee, in their jointly issued urgent notice, demanded that all factories, mines, and construction sites in the region rapidly improve working conditions in high-temperature workshops and open-air construction sites. The urgent notice also put forward specific and practical measures: (1) According to the specific conditions of each unit, add equipment such as electric fans, exhaust fans, window holes, and sunshades, and use methods such as watering the roof, using large amounts of natural ice, and turning heating pipes into cold air pipes to lower the workshop temperature. (2) Without affecting production, adjust working hours and labor organization, extend the lunch break, or adopt a rotation break system; units where production cannot be interrupted can adopt a rotating shift system; strictly control leisure activity time and reduce summer activities. (3) Fully supply employees with drinks to relieve heat, add various heatstroke prevention medicines, organize doctors and health workers to go to the workshops, and strengthen heatstroke prevention work.

    华北劳动局和工会紧急通知
    注意夏季保护工人健康
    华北行政委员会劳动局和中华全国总工会华北工作委员会，在七月十八日联合向全区各厂矿和建筑工地，发出关于夏季保护工人健康和改进劳动条件的紧急通知。
    从七月七日开始，华北地区气候骤然转热，许多工厂高温车间的温度超过华氏百度以上。天津市、北京市、河北省和山西省的许多工厂和建筑工地，连日来曾不断发生工人中暑晕倒事故。有的单位已不得不缩短或暂时停开机器，直接影响到生产任务的完成。如唐山华新纺织厂建筑工地在八日下午就停工了两小时；天津钢厂各车间在七日以后，每天生产计划都不能完成。
    根据这种情况，华北行政委员会劳动局和中华全国总工会华北工作委员会在联合发出的紧急通知中，要求全区各厂矿和建筑工地迅速改进高温车间和露天工地的劳动条件。紧急通知并提出了具体的切实可行的办法：（一）根据各单位的具体条件，增添电扇、排气风扇、窗孔、凉棚等设备，用屋顶浇水、大量使用天然冰、把暖气管通冷水变冷汽管等办法降低车间温度。（二）在不影响生产的情况下，调整工作时间和劳动组织，延长中午休息时间或采用轮换休息的办法；生产不能中断的单位，可采用轮流插班制；严格控制业余活动时间，减少暑期活动。（三）充分供给职工解暑饮料，增添各种消暑药品，组织医生、保健员下车间，加强防暑工作。（新华社）
