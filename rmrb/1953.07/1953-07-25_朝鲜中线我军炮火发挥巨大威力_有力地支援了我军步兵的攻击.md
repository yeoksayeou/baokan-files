Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 24th: In the counterattack south of Kimhwa and west of the Pukhan River on the central Korean front, our powerful artillery fire displayed tremendous power, strongly supporting our infantry's attacks.

Before the battle for Namsan, northeast of Shangganling's Chuzidong, our artillery fire's destructive shooting at enemy fortifications inflicted a devastating blow on the enemy. A certain howitzer battalion of our army destroyed more than 100 enemy fortifications of various kinds in two firing sessions. When the counterattack began on the night of the 13th, our various artillery groups began a fierce bombardment of the enemy positions. A blaze of fire suddenly rose on Namsan of Chuzidong, turning the rainy night sky red. Compared with the continuous explosions of artillery shells, the flares fired by the enemy were as dim as phosphorescent light.

As our infantry bravely charged towards Namsan of Chuzidong, our fierce artillery fire immediately extended to the enemy's rear, suppressing all the enemy's howitzer fire. After our infantry rushed onto Namsan of Chuzidong, they saw that most of the enemy's chemical mortar groups and other short-range artillery groups had been destroyed by our artillery fire. Many heavy artillery and howitzer groups on the enemy's rear positions also hastily withdrew under the attack of our artillery fire. Many enemy artillerymen abandoned their cannons and fled in panic. With the coordination of powerful artillery fire, our infantry advanced rapidly and suffered very few casualties. A certain company of our infantry advanced three kilometers from the start of the charge until it penetrated the enemy's heart and captured another enemy position, with only four soldiers wounded. The infantrymen praised: Our artillery fire is like an iron broom, smashing the enemy to pieces and clearing the obstacles on our charging path.

Under the attack of our powerful artillery fire, enemy officers and soldiers were stunned and panicked. Although the enemy officers and soldiers captured in this battle have now been sent to our army's prisoner of war camp, their fearful expressions towards our powerful artillery fire have not yet completely disappeared. They described our artillery fire hitting their positions "like a volcanic eruption," collapsing and shaking down most of their bunkers and shelters, with many enemy soldiers being killed and stunned.

A ROK army platoon leader, who is still somewhat dazed from being hit by our artillery fire, said: "At that time, the company commander ordered me to lead the troops out to resist, but the artillery fire was so intense that I dared not crawl out of the bomb shelter. When the artillery fire subsided a little, I crawled out of the hole and saw corpses lying all over the hilltop. Just as I was about to turn around and run away, the artillery fire sounded again, and I was knocked unconscious."

A captured soldier, formerly a communications soldier in a ROK army howitzer battalion, said: "Shells kept exploding on our positions, making it impossible for the eighteen howitzers in our battalion to fire even a single shot. The commander was so anxious that he stomped his feet, then he crawled out of the tunnel and ran away. We immediately abandoned the cannons and scrambled down the mountain to save our lives."

A captured American tank soldier also talked about how their tank company was attacked by our artillery fire. He said: "Our tanks really couldn't stand such fierce artillery fire. Some were blown rolling down the hillside, and some burst into flames. The tracks of my tank were blown off. When I jumped out of the tank to escape, a shell knocked me to the ground."

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 24th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft artillery units, which are defending the railway line in northern Korea, continue to achieve new victories in fierce air combat.

In July, Korea entered the rainy season, and the river water levels rose. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the US invading air force frantically bombed our rear transportation lines and important bridges day and night. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft artillery units guarding the railway line, in coordination with other air defense units of the Korean and Chinese people's forces, used dense artillery fire to meet the invading enemy planes. From July 10th to 20th, in eleven days, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's anti-aircraft artillery units guarding the railway line shot down ten enemy planes and damaged twenty-one enemy planes, severely hitting the US air force's conspiracy to cut off our army's railway transportation line during the flood season.

On July 20th, the enemy dispatched 40 aircraft in three batches to bomb the ×× River Bridge. At 12:30 noon that day, eight enemy F-86 aircraft flew from the west coast to carry out a dive bombing of the ×× River Bridge. Our anti-aircraft artillery units immediately met the enemy planes head-on with fierce and accurate artillery fire. As a result of the battle, our army shot down three enemy planes and damaged three enemy planes. In one of the enemy planes shot down, the pilot hurriedly parachuted to escape, but fell to his death on the ×× River Bridge.

Under the heavy blows of our army's anti-aircraft artillery units, the enemy's conspiracy to destroy and cut off our army's railway transportation line failed. The railway transportation line in northern Korea has always been unimpeded.

    朝鲜中线我军炮火发挥巨大威力
    有力地支援了我军步兵的攻击
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】在朝鲜中线北汉江以西金城以南反击战中，我军强大的炮火发挥了巨大的威力，有力地支援了我军步兵的攻击。
    在上甘岭东北注字洞南山的战斗发起之前，我军炮火对敌人工事的破坏射击，给了敌人毁灭性的打击。我军某榴弹炮营在两次射击中即摧毁敌军各种工事一百多处。到十三日夜里反击开始的时候，我军各种炮群一齐开始对敌军阵地进行猛烈的轰击。注字洞南山上顿时腾起一片火光，映红了雨夜的天空。敌人放射的照明弹与连连爆炸的炮弹火光相比，宛如点点磷光那样的黯淡。
    当我军步兵奋勇冲向注字洞南山时，我军猛烈的炮火马上伸向敌人的纵深，把敌人的曲射炮火全部压住。我军步兵在冲上注字洞南山以后就看到敌人的化学迫击炮群和其他短距离炮群大部分被我炮火摧毁了。在敌人纵深阵地上的许多重炮和榴弹炮群也在我军炮火的打击下，仓皇的撤走了，许多敌人的炮兵丢了大炮就慌忙的向后奔逃了。我军步兵在强大炮火配合下进展神速，伤亡很小。我军步兵某连从冲锋开始到插入敌人心脏夺取了另一个敌人阵地时为止，前进三公里只有四人负伤。步兵们称赞说：我们的炮火简直是把铁扫帚，打得敌人七零八落，给我们扫清了冲锋道路上的障碍。
    敌军官兵在我军强大炮火的打击下，吓得目瞪口呆，惊慌失措。在这次战斗中被俘的敌军官兵目前虽然已被送到我军的俘虏收容所，但他们畏惧我军强大炮火的惊惧神色直到现在还没有完全消除。他们形容我军炮火打得他们的阵地“好像火山爆发一样”，把他们的地堡、掩蔽部大部分打塌和震塌了，许多敌军被炸死和震昏。
    有一个被我军炮火打得到现在还有些发呆的李伪军排长说：“当时连长命令我带部队出去抵抗，可是炮火打得我不敢爬出防炮洞。等到炮火稍减少一些，我爬出洞口一看山头上躺满了尸体。我正想扭转屁股逃跑，炮声又响了，这时我就被震昏过去了。”
    一个被俘士兵、原是李伪军榴弹炮营的通讯兵，他说：“炮弹不断在我们的阵地上爆炸，弄得我们营里十八门榴弹炮连一发都打不出去。指挥官急得跺脚，接着他爬出坑道就逃走了，我们马上丢了大炮，连滚带爬地向山下逃命。”
    一个被俘的美军坦克手也谈到了他们一个坦克连遭到我军炮火打击的情形。他说：“我们的坦克真受不了这样猛烈的炮火。有的被打得在山坡上滚，有的燃起了大火。我的那辆坦克被炸断了履带。当我跳出坦克准备逃跑时，一颗炮弹把我震倒在地上。”
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】保卫朝鲜北部铁道线的中国人民志愿军高射炮部队在激烈的对空作战中，继续取得新的胜利。
    七月份，朝鲜进入雨季，江河水位涨高。美国侵朝空军乘机对我后方交通线和重要桥梁日夜进行疯狂轰炸。守卫在铁道线上的中国人民志愿军高射炮部队在朝中人民部队其他防空部队的配合下，以密集的炮火迎击来犯的敌机。七月十日到二十日十一天中，守卫在铁道线上的中国人民志愿军高射炮部队某部就击落敌机十架，击伤敌机二十一架，严重地打击了美国空军妄图在洪水期间切断我军铁道运输线的阴谋。
    七月二十日，敌人先后出动飞机四十架次，分三批轰炸我××江大桥。当天中午十二时三十分，敌F—八十六型飞机八架由西海岸飞来向××江大桥进行俯冲轰炸。我高射炮部队立即以猛烈而准确的炮火迎头痛击敌机。战斗结果，我军击落敌机三架，击伤敌机三架。在击落的敌机中有一架敌机的驾驶员慌忙跳伞逃命，摔死在××江大桥上。
    在我军高射炮部队的沉重打击下，敌人妄图破坏和切断我军铁道运输线的阴谋失败了。朝鲜北部的铁道运输线始终畅通无阻。
