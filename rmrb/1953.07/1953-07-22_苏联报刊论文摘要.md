Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

Improve Party Leadership over Newspapers

The "People's Daily" published an editorial on July 1st entitled "Improve Party Leadership over Newspapers," pointing out the great significance of party leadership over newspapers and periodicals. The abstract is as follows:

Party committees should use newspapers and periodicals as a base for improving written and oral propaganda and should rely on newspapers and magazines to influence all aspects of ideological work.

The Party Central Committee requires the Party Central Committees of all the Union Republics, the border region committees, the state committees, the municipal committees, and district committees to concretely lead newspapers and to help them regularly.

Recently, many party committees have improved their leadership over newspapers. The party committees of many states have discussed the reports of the editors of the state newspapers in plenary sessions. Some Party Central Committees of the Union Republics have held meetings of the staff of the Republic newspapers. Many party committees have listened to the reports of the editorial staff at party committee meetings. All this will surely affect the improvement of the content of the newspapers.

Everyone knows that only politically mature and talented journalists can make newspapers into fighting newspapers. Party committees must carefully select journalistic cadres, cultivate them with care, educate them with a high degree of principle, and care about their Marxist-Leninist cultivation and the improvement of their professional level.

It is the duty of the Party Committee to regularly consolidate and expand the ties between newspapers and the masses, to regularly hold meetings of worker-peasant correspondents and active contributors, and to regularly hold reader meetings to discuss the reports of the editorial staff on the work of the newspaper and the plans of the editorial department. It is important that the Party Committee give effective support to the initiatives of production innovators reported in the newspaper. The Party Committee's newspaper should be a powerful weapon for promoting and expanding advanced experiences.

The strength of our newspapers and periodicals lies in the leadership of the Party and in its constant guiding influence. The Party Committee should pay attention to the continuous improvement of newspapers, the improvement of their ideological and cultural level, and the improvement of their organizational role.

Improving party leadership over newspapers is a necessary condition for enhancing the role of newspapers in the ideological and political education of the masses.

Enable newspapers and magazines to penetrate into the masses

The "People's Daily" published an editorial on June 26, discussing the importance of party committees in various places to attach importance to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The abstract is as follows:

While the Party is improving newspapers and periodicals and raising their level, it must also attach importance to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. In the most recent years alone, our country has added more than 4,000 newsstands and bookstores. The more deeply the opinions of newspapers and periodicals penetrate the broad masses, the greater the influence of our publishing industry on the socio-economic and cultural life of the Soviet Union.

However, there are still serious shortcomings in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. Some Party Central Committees of the Union Republics, border region and state party committees leave the distribution of periodicals and newspapers entirely to the local branches of the "Newspaper Distribution Association," abandoning their own supervision of newspaper distribution. These party committees forget that newspapers and periodicals are the sharpest weapons of the Party, and forget that it is the personal business and direct responsibility of the Party organizations, especially the propaganda departments of the Party committees, to promote newspapers and periodicals among the residents in a timely and effective manner.

The "Newspaper Distribution Association" has not done its job well in organizing the subscription of newspapers and periodicals, especially in the countryside. Many periodicals and newspapers are delivered to subscribers after a long delay. In the post and telecommunications branch of the Novosiliskaya District in the Orel State, newspapers from eight or nine days ago are often sent to subscribers in bundles. Newspapers and periodicals that have not been sold and are stockpiled there become waste paper. This phenomenon of retailing newspapers is extremely abnormal.

The distribution of newspapers and periodicals is a work of great political significance. The major shortcomings in this work must be resolutely eliminated. The state committees, border region committees, and central committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics should regularly discuss the issue of newspaper distribution among residents in the Party Committee, and pay regular attention to the circulation of each newspaper and magazine. It is necessary to regularly supervise the work of the organizations of the "Newspaper Distribution Association" and provide them with the necessary assistance in the selection and allocation of cadres, the organization of newspaper subscriptions, and the delivery of newspapers to readers. Party organizations should pay special attention to the distribution of state, municipal, district, and youth newspapers published in the languages of the nationalities.

The various organizations of the Soviet Ministry of Post and Telecommunications should thoroughly improve the distribution and delivery of newspapers and periodicals.

The demands made by the editorial departments of newspapers on TASS are justified, because the publication of newspapers is often delayed due to the latter's faults. The leadership of TASS must improve the supply of news content for newspapers, and avoid delays, and broadcast news in a timely manner and within the prescribed time limits.

The editorial departments and publishing departments of newspapers and magazines have a direct responsibility for the distribution of their own newspapers and periodicals. They must take all measures to improve the ideological and political level of newspapers and periodicals, and improve their printing and binding styles. They should publish newspapers and periodicals on time, publish articles on the distribution of newspapers and periodicals according to plan, and publish subscription advertisements.

Clubs, rural reading rooms, and libraries can do a lot in promoting and popularizing the work of newspapers and periodicals. At the same time, it is also very necessary to attract teachers, doctors, agronomists, activists of collective farms, and members of the Youth League to participate in this work more widely.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    改善党对报纸的领导
    “真理报”七月一日发表了以“改善党对报纸的领导”为题的社论，指出党对报刊领导的重大意义。摘要如下：
    党委会应当使用报刊作为改善文字宣传和口头宣传的基地，应当依靠报纸和杂志去影响思想工作的各个方面。
    党的中央委员会要求各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、边疆区委会、州委会、市委会和区委会去具体地领导报纸，并经常帮助它们。
    最近，许多党委会改善了对报纸的领导。许多州的党委会在全体会议上讨论了州报编辑的报告。有些加盟共和国共产党中央委员会进行了共和国报纸工作人员的会议。许多党委会听取了编辑人员在党委会上的报告。所有这些一定会影响到报纸内容的改善。
    谁都知道，只有政治上成熟的、具有才能的新闻干部才能使报纸成为战斗的报纸。党委会必须审慎地选拔新闻干部，爱惜地培养他们，用高度原则性的精神来教育他们，关心他们的马克思列宁主义修养和他们的业务水平的提高。
    党委会的职责，就是要经常巩固和扩大报纸与群众的联系，定期举行工农通讯员会议和积极撰稿者会议，并定期举办读者会议，讨论编辑人员关于报纸工作的报告和编辑部的计划。重要的是，党委会对报纸上所报道的生产革新者的倡议要予以有效的支持。党委会的报纸应当是宣传和扩大先进经验的强有力的武器。
    我们报刊的力量就在于党的领导，在于它的经常指导的影响。党委会应当注意报纸的不断的改善，报纸的思想和文化水平的提高，以及它们的组织作用的提高。
    改善党对报纸的领导，就是提高报纸在群众的思想政治教育中的作用的必要条件。
    使报纸和杂志深入到群众中去
        “真理报”六月二十六日发表社论，论述各地党委
    应重视报刊的发行工作。摘要如下：
    党在改进报刊和提高报刊水平的同时，也要重视报刊的发行。仅在最近数年中，我国增设了四千多个报摊和书店。报刊的言论愈深入广大群众，我们的出版事业对苏维埃社会经济和文化生活的影响也愈大。
    但是在报刊的发行工作中仍有严重的缺点。某些加盟共和国共产党中央委员会，边疆区和州的党委会，把期刊和报纸的发行工作让给“报刊发行联合会”地方分处全部包办，放弃了本身对报刊发行的监督。这些党委们忘记了报刊是党的最尖锐的武器，忘记了使报刊及时地、有效地在居民中推广乃是党组织的、特别是党委会宣传鼓动部的切身事业和直接职责。
    “报刊发行联合会”在组织报刊的订阅方面，没有做好自己的工作，特别是在农村中。很多期刊和报纸过了很多时候才送到订户手中，在奥勒尔州诺瓦西里斯卡娅区的邮电分局中，就常把八、九天的报纸成捆地送给订户。报刊没有推销出去，积压在那里，便成为废纸。这种零售报纸的现象是极不正常的。
    报刊的发行是一件具有重大政治意义的工作。必须坚决消灭这一工作中的重大缺点。各个州委、边疆区区委和各加盟共和国共产党的中央委员会，应当定期在党委会中讨论报刊在居民中的发行问题，经常注意每一种报纸和杂志的发行量。应当经常监督各个“报刊发行联合会”组织的工作，在选拔和分配干部、组织对报刊的订阅和把报刊送给读者方面给它们以必要的帮助。党组织应特别注意以各民族语言出版的州、市、区和青年的报纸的发行工作。
    苏联邮电部的各个组织应当彻底改善报刊的发行和递送工作。
    各报编辑部对塔斯社提出的要求是正当的，由于后者的过失，才常耽误了各报的出报时间。塔斯社的领导方面必须把供应报纸的新闻内容加以改进，并避免迟误，及时地、按照规定的时限播送新闻。
    报纸和杂志的编辑部和出版发行部对于自己报刊的发行工作负有直接的责任。它们必须采取一切办法来提高报刊的思想政治水平，和改进它的印刷装订样式。它们应当使报刊按时出版，有计划地刊登论述报刊发行工作的文章，并登载订阅启事。
    各俱乐部、农村阅览室和图书馆在宣传和推广报刊工作方面，可以做很多工作，同时，更广泛地吸引教师、医生、农学家、集体农庄积极分子和青年团员参加这一工作，也是很必要的。
