The Northeast Local Industry Bureau held a meeting of heads of provincial and municipal industry bureaus from June 30th to July 6th to study and resolve several major issues in the current local industry.

The meeting lasted seven days. After generally discussing and resolving issues such as the third-quarter work plan, product sales, cost and quota management, the meeting, following the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and in light of the actual situation of current local industry, focused on discussing the product quality of local industries.

The product quality of Northeast local industry has improved in recent years. Especially since the second quarter, in conjunction with the anti-bureaucracy struggle, local industrial departments in various provinces and cities, under the leadership of the Northeast Local Industry Bureau, have begun to pay attention to and inspect product quality, and have begun to improve it. For example, Anshan, Lüda, Songjiang, Fushun, and other places have conducted typical experiments to improve the quality of red bricks, oils, paper, and agricultural tools in several major industries, and the quality and quantity of products have significantly improved. Taking red bricks as an example: the average daily output after the typical experiment increased by 83.7% compared to 1952, and the quality of first-class bricks in 1952 only reached 59.49%, which increased to 70.9% after the typical experiment. However, this improvement is far from enough. At present, the following two situations exist relatively commonly in the product quality of Northeast local industry: one is that although the product quality has improved initially, it is extremely unstable. For example, the cement mixer produced by the Fushun Electromechanical Factory had a reject rate of 60%. Although it was later improved, it was always fluctuating and did not meet the standard. Lüda City conducted a survey of 100 major products produced locally and found that 59% of the products were often inconsistent in quality, and the masses had many opinions. The second situation is that the product quality is poor. For example, the reject rate of paper reels produced by the Songjiang Provincial Local State-owned Paper Mill in the first and second quarters was nearly 100%, and the lowest was more than 40%. In the first half of the year, products worth more than 20 billion yuan were stockpiled in Harbin due to poor product quality.

As a result of the discussion at the meeting, everyone unanimously believed that the fundamental reason for the poor product quality is that the technical management of local industries lags behind the development of production. Many factories still carry out production without operating procedures. Some factories have neither quality standards during production nor inspection systems upon delivery; the phenomenon of poor quality caused by non-compliance with operating procedures and the lack of a strict quality responsibility system is also extremely alarming. One of the reasons for this backward technical management is that the leading cadres of many local state-owned factories and mines have the view of simply pursuing quantity and not paying attention to quality. In order to rush tasks, they often not only ignore technical management, but even adopt methods of arbitrarily lowering quality standards to achieve "results" in completing quantity.

After discussion, the leading comrades of local industries in various provinces and cities clearly realized that strengthening technical management and continuing to improve product quality is the central task of current local industry.

Regarding the specific methods for strengthening technical management in the third quarter, Ju Kangjie, director of the Local Industry Bureau, pointed out in his summary of the meeting that various provinces and cities have made some innovations in specific methods for improving quality, such as organizing visits, holding product appraisal meetings, conducting investigations and research, visiting consumers, and contacting scientific and artistic departments to obtain their assistance. These methods can continue to be adopted, but the main link in improving quality at present lies in strengthening technical management. Therefore, in the third quarter, it is necessary to do the following: (1) Universally formulate or check and revise operating procedures. This is one of the prerequisites for improving quality. Local industrial departments in various provinces and cities must fully mobilize workers and technicians to combine technology with practical experience, concentrate on advanced operating methods for summarization and improvement, and then submit them to workers for discussion so that all workers can master them and implement them as factory rules and regulations; (2) Establish a quality responsibility system, formulate quality standards for major products, establish and improve inspection agencies, adhere to the implementation of the inspection system, and clarify the division of responsibilities of various departments. In this work, attention should be paid to fighting against backward and conservative tendencies; (3) Strengthen technical organization and technical measures in enterprises and improve old equipment; (4) Study and formulate various quality incentive systems.

Finally, regarding the leadership methods for strengthening technical management, Director Ju pointed out that it is necessary to prevent the shortcomings that often exist in past work, such as "grasping everything but grasping nothing well," resulting in repeated cycles without improvement. We should adapt to the characteristics of local industry, start with a few major industries (such as oils, red bricks, paper, agricultural tools, etc.), and leading cadres should go deep down and do a good job from point to area.

    东北地方工业局决定大力提高产品质量
    东北地方工业局于六月三十日至七月六日召开了各省市工业厅局长会议，研究解决当前地方工业中的几个主要问题。
    会议历时七天，在一般地讨论解决了第三季度工作、产品推销、成本与定额管理等问题后，遵照中共中央东北局的指示，针对当前地方工业的实际情况，着重讨论了地方工业的产品质量问题。
    东北地方工业的产品质量近年来是有改进的，特别是第二季度以来，结合反官僚主义斗争，各省市地方工业部门在东北地方工业局的领导下都开始重视和检查了产品质量，并着手注意改进。如鞍山、旅大、松江、抚顺等地在红砖、油脂、造纸、农具等几个主要行业进行了提高质量的典型试验，产品质量、数量都有显著提高。以红砖为例：典型试验后的平均日产量比一九五二年提高百分之八十三·七，质量一九五二年一等砖只达到百分之五十九·四九，典型试验后就提高到百分之七十·九。但这种改进还远远不够。目前在东北地方工业的产品质量上较普遍地存在如下两种情况：一种是产品质量虽有初步改进，但极不稳定。如抚顺机电厂生产的洋灰搅拌机，废品率曾达百分之六十，后来虽有改进，但始终是忽高忽低，达不到标准。旅大市曾就本地出产的一百种主要产品进行过调查，发现有百分之五十九的产品经常是时好时坏，群众意见纷纷。第二种情况是产品质量低劣。如松江省地方国营造纸厂第一季和第二季出的盘纸废品率几达百分之百，最低的时候也在百分之四十以上。哈尔滨市上半年因产品质量低劣而积压的产品，价值达二百多亿元。
    会上讨论的结果，大家一致认为：产品质量低劣的基本原因在于地方工业的技术管理落后于生产发展。很多工厂至今还是在没有操作规程的情况下进行生产的。有的工厂生产时既没有质量标准，出厂时又没有检验制度；由于不遵守操作规程、缺少严格的质量责任制而造成质量低劣的现象也异常惊人。造成这种技术管理落后的原因之一，是不少地方国营厂矿的领导干部存在着单纯追求数量，不重视质量的观点。他们往往为了赶任务，就不但忽略了技术管理，甚至采用随意降低质量标准的办法以取得完成数量的“成绩”。
    经过讨论，各省、市地方工业的领导同志明确认识到：加强技术管理，继续提高产品质量，是当前地方工业的中心任务。
    关于第三季度加强技术管理的具体作法，地方工业局鞠抗捷局长在会议总结中指出：改进质量的具体方法各省市曾有一些创造，如组织参观，开产品评奖会、进行调查研究、访问消费者、和科学、艺术部门联系取得他们的帮助等，这些方法都可以继续采用，但当前提高质量的主要环节在于加强技术管理。因此，在第三季度必须做好：（一）普遍制订或检查修订操作规程。这是改善质量的先决条件之一。各省、市地方工业部门必须充分发动工人和技术人员，使技术与实际经验相结合，集中先进操作方法加以总结提高，然后交付工人讨论，使所有的工人都能掌握，成为厂规厂法来贯彻执行；（二）建立质量责任制，制订主要产品的质量标准，建立和健全检查机构，坚持贯彻检查制度，明确各科室的责任分工，在这一工作中要注意向落后保守的倾向作斗争；（三）加强企业中的技术组织和技术措施，改进旧有设备；（四）研究制订各种质量奖励制度。
    最后，关于加强技术管理的领导方法，鞠局长指出：必须防止过去工作中常有的“样样都抓样样抓不好”，结果循环往复还是没有提高的缺点。应当适应地方工业的特点，先从几个主要行业着手（如油脂、红砖、造纸、农具等），领导干部深入下去由点到面把工作搞好。
