Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 30th: In accordance with the armistice order issued by Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, all armed forces of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have completely withdrawn all military forces from the Demilitarized Zone within seventy-two hours after the armistice agreement came into effect.

After 22:00 on July 27th, all armed forces of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the front line meticulously carried out various preparations for the withdrawal from the Demilitarized Zone. From dawn on the 28th, the front-line units began to withdraw in batches. The work of withdrawing from the Demilitarized Zone was successfully completed before 22:00 on July 30th.

During the withdrawal from the Demilitarized Zone, the infantry, artillery, tank, and engineering units of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were orderly and marched in mighty and neat formations. The Korean-Chinese People's transport units also retreated simultaneously, carrying large quantities of grain, ammunition, and supplies.

In compliance with the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean-Chinese People's Army uniformly retreated two kilometers from the already announced military demarcation line on both sides across the entire front, arriving at new positions along the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone. This new line is near the 38th parallel, starting four kilometers southeast of Kosong on the east coast, passing southwest one kilometer south of Yuhyun-san, approximately two and a half kilometers south of Mount Wu Sheng, two kilometers southwest of Western Mountain, seven and a half kilometers south of Saknyong, five and a half kilometers south of Guhwari, and approximately eight kilometers east of Kaesong, reaching the Imjin River estuary on the west coast.

Currently, the Korean-Chinese People's Army is vigilantly guarding its new positions, preventing any invasion or destructive actions from the other side. All commanders and fighters of the Korean-Chinese People's forces have unanimously stated that they will continue to strictly abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement and will never enter the Demilitarized Zone.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong Front, July 30th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units on the Kaesong front, along with their supplies and equipment, completely withdrew from the Demilitarized Zone at 21:30 (Korean time) on the 30th.

The withdrawal of the Volunteer Army units on the Kaesong front was carried out under the personal command and supervision of the unit command. On the first day of the ceasefire, a large amount of military supplies began to be withdrawn, some fortifications began to be leveled, and communication trenches were filled. Within hours of the ceasefire, the units hastily repaired a three-kilometer-long road, and tanks and some heavy artillery were withdrawn from the Demilitarized Zone on the first day. At 15:00 on the second day of the ceasefire, the Volunteer Army units on the Kaesong front began a large-scale withdrawal across the entire front. Trucks loaded with large quantities of ammunition and military supplies, vehicles and mules pulling various artillery pieces, and infantry units in magnificent formations withdrew in an orderly manner north of the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone. On the last day of the withdrawal, unit commanders spent the entire day directing and inspecting the withdrawal work in the Demilitarized Zone. With the exception of a very small number of personnel maintaining order who remained for the final withdrawal, all units, supplies, and equipment were withdrawn in batches from 18:30 in the afternoon.

Before withdrawing from the Demilitarized Zone, the Volunteer Army units strictly adhered to the Armistice Agreement, sending engineers to carefully clear explosive devices, minefields, barbed wire, and other dangerous materials that had been set up before the ceasefire. Between the military demarcation line and the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone, engineers have cleared necessary safe passages and areas for the staff of the Joint Observer Group of the Military Armistice Commission to pass through, and have placed obvious markers in all areas where dangerous materials are known to be present but cannot be cleared in the short term. The unit command marked the safe passages, safe areas, and dangerous areas on military maps and submitted a detailed report to our commander after withdrawing from the Demilitarized Zone in order to report to the Military Armistice Commission. By the time the units withdrew to the area north of the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone, the markers along the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone had been erected.

    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体武装部队遵照朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军发布的停战命令，已经在停战协定生效后的七十二小时内，将一切军事力量全部撤出了非军事区。
    七月二十七日二十二时后，在正面战线上的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的全体武装部队便认真周密地进行了撤出非军事区的各项准备工作。从二十八日黎明起，前线各部队即开始分批后撤。这项撤离非军事区的工作，到七月三十日二十二时前就已顺利完成。
    在撤离非军事区中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的步兵部队、炮兵部队、坦克部队、工兵部队秩序井然，行列威武整齐。朝中人民运输部队也载运着大量的粮弹物资同时后撤。
    朝中人民军队遵守朝鲜停战协定，在规定的时间内，全线一律自双方已经公布的军事分界线后撤二公里，到达非军事区北缘一线的新阵地上。这条新阵线是在三八线南北附近，东起东海岸高城东南四公里处向西南经过鱼隐山南一公里、五圣山南约二公里半、西方山西南二公里、朔宁南七公里半、九化里南五公里半和开城以东约八公里到达西海岸临津江口。
    目前，朝中人民军队正警惕地守卫在新阵地上，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和破坏行动。朝中人民部队全体指挥员战斗员一致表示：要继续切实遵守朝鲜停战协定，决不进入非军事区一步。
    【新华社开城前线三十日电】开城前线中国人民志愿军部队及其供应物资和装备，已于三十日二十一时三十分（朝鲜时间）全部撤离非军事区。
    开城前线志愿军部队的撤离工作，是在部队指挥机关亲自指挥监督之下进行的。停火后第一天，大批军用物资即开始撤离，部分工事开始平毁，交通沟被填平。在停火后数小时内，部队即突击修复了一条长三公里的公路，坦克及部分重炮在第一天即撤离了非军事区。停火后第二天下午三时，开城前线志愿军部队全线开始大规模撤离。装载着大批弹药、军用物资的卡车与牵引各种大炮的车辆和骡马，列成雄壮队伍的步兵部队，秩序井然地向非军事区北缘以北撤离。在撤离的最后一天，部队指挥员整日在非军事区指导和检查撤离工作。除极少数维持秩序的人员留待最后撤离外，所有一切部队、供应与装备自下午六时半起分批撤离。
    志愿军部队在撤离非军事区以前，曾严格遵照停战协定，派出工兵仔细地清除了在停火前所设置的爆破物、地雷阵地、铁丝网及其他危险物。在军事分界线和非军事区北缘之间，工兵们已清除出必要的安全通道和安全地区，供军事停战委员会联合观察小组的工作人员通行，并于所有知悉设有危险物而在短期内无法清除的地区，设立了明显的标志物。部队指挥机关将安全通道、安全地区和危险区标记于军事地图上，在撤离非军事区后，即向我军司令员提出详细报告，以便报告军事停战委员会。部队撤至非军事区北缘以北的地区时，非军事区北缘沿线的标志物已树立完毕。
