Several Questions Regarding Rural Amateur Theater Troupes

Recently, this newspaper received letters from over a dozen readers and correspondents, including Wang Qiang from the eastern suburbs of Beijing, Yang Zhenting and Ma Wenqing from Fuping, Hebei, Feng Haijin and Cui Zhiyou from Ping顺, Shanxi, Chen Jingwu from Xinyang, Henan, Zhang Shengyu from Hanchuan, Hubei, Chu Yi from Jiangyin, Jiangsu, Huang Nianbiao from Wukang, Zhejiang, Tu Yuchu from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, Sun Xianming from Tonglu, Anhui, Ren Tianhua from Jintang, Sichuan, and Zhao Chunhua from Longjiang, Heilongjiang, reflecting many problems existing in the activities of rural amateur theater troupes. We have summarized them into five questions and provide simple answers below:

(1) Can rural theater troupes develop towards professionalization?

Some letters reflect that some rural theater troupes, because of slight performance achievements, purchase large amounts of costumes and perform in other districts and counties. For example, the "Star Theater Troupe" in Zhou Dong Township, Zhouzhuang, Jiangyin, some of whose members belong to high-yield mutual aid teams that have won red flags, went to Changshu in April to perform. When the township asked them to return to set production plans, they said, "The red flag earned from performing is bigger and more beautiful, we don't want the one at home." The theater troupe in Lala Village, Twenty-first District, Jiutai County, Jilin, was praised in the past. From last summer's hoeing to this year's preparation for cultivation, they have been performing outside. In the county seat, they use hired horse-drawn carriages to create a brand image, selling tickets to perform large-scale plays such as "The Marriage of Little Erhei."

Rural theater troupes are mass amateur artistic organizations to satisfy rural cultural and recreational life. They engage in activities under the principle of voluntarism, based on subjective and objective conditions, using spare time, especially during slack farming seasons. Therefore, they should not only not hinder production but also promote and encourage it, to achieve the goals of developing production, promoting work, and enlivening rural cultural life. The primary task of the peasant masses is to do a good job in production. If rural amateur theater troupes, without considering subjective and objective conditions, regardless of the impact on production, blindly develop towards professionalization, purchase costumes, stage large plays, run the circuit, and tour everywhere, wasting time and manpower, they are bound to be extravagant and wasteful, hindering production. This violates the principles of "amateur, voluntary, serving production" and becomes detached from the masses.

(2) Can rural theater troupes perform large plays?

In many areas of Sichuan, rural theater troupes have performed large plays such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Liu Hulan," "Blood and Tears," and "Red Maid." Some places spend four or five months rehearsing large plays, collecting money from the masses, and even purchasing five or six sets of scenery and buying hand-cranked generators to provide electric lights. Large plays are labor-intensive, costly, and time-consuming, and generally speaking, are not suitable for the specific conditions of China's rural economy at present. All theater troupes that rehearse large plays and historical dramas based on the interests and wishes of a few people, without considering realistic conditions, hinder production and are bound to cause dissatisfaction among the masses. Our opinion is that rural theater troupes should mainly adopt methods that save money, effort, and manpower, focusing on reflecting rural life and struggles, and fully utilize the small and diverse art forms that the masses enjoy.

(3) How to solve the problem of performance materials?

Some rural theater troupes emphasize relying on the masses to "self-compile" to solve the problem of performance materials, which is worth studying. Whether the masses can create themselves depends on the specific situation. When new heroic figures and deeds emerge in the lives of the masses, if rural theater troupes have a certain creative force, it is possible to create. To create well, they should try to win the cooperation of local outstanding folk artists and the guidance of local propaganda, cultural, and educational leading organs. However, "self-compilation" should not be regarded as a direction, nor should it be universally required. If "self-compilation" is overemphasized, it is easy to form a phenomenon of random compilation and alteration. Things compiled in this way are prone to commit the faults of formulaic and conceptualization, and even the content violates policies. Propaganda and cultural and educational organs in various places should systematically organize and lead the supply of materials. Professional art workers should be required to strengthen contact with rural amateur theater troupes and create more short programs with strong artistic and ideological content to supply the needs of rural theater troupes. On the other hand, our motherland has extremely rich folk art heritage, which is loved by the vast masses. For example, lion dances popular throughout the country, Northeast Taiping drums, Anhui Flower Drum Lanterns, Hebei donkey runs, and other folk songs and dances, which are lively, healthy, and have a strong popular character, should be vigorously promoted.

(4) How should the funding problem of rural theater troupes be solved?

Regarding the funding problem of rural theater troupes, some local rural theater troupes adopt methods such as apportioning or disguised apportioning (such as mobilizing voluntary donations and forcing the sale of theater tickets) to ask for money from the masses, which is wrong and alienates the masses. The funding of rural theater troupes should be approved by the village government, and a small amount of fees should be collected from the masses based on actual needs such as lamp oil and makeup expenses and the ability of the masses to bear them during performances based on the principle of the masses being consciously willing. The leading departments in various places must properly control this.

### 关于农村业余剧团的几个问题

    关于农村业余剧团的几个问题
    最近本报收到北京东郊王强、河北阜平杨振庭、马文清，山西平顺冯海锦、崔志有，河南信阳陈景武，湖北汉川张声玉，江苏江阴褚易，浙江武康黄年标，浙江嘉兴屠余初，安徽桐庐孙显明，四川金堂任天华，黑龙江龙江赵春华等十余读者和通讯员的来信，反映农村业余剧团活动中存在着许多问题。我们把它们归纳为五个问题，简单解答如下：
    （一）农村剧团是否可向专业化发展？
    有些来信反映，有些农村剧团因为演出略有成绩，就大置衣箱，到外区外县演出。例如江阴周庄周东乡的明星剧团，其中有人属于得过红旗的丰产互助组，今年四月间到常熟去演戏，乡里找他们回来订生产计划，他们这时却说：“作戏得的红旗又大又漂亮，家里的不要了。”吉林九台县二十一区拉拉屯的剧团过去因为受到过表扬，自去年夏锄到今年备耕，一直在外面演戏，在县城里用雇马车创牌子的方式，卖票演出“小二黑结婚”等大型话剧。
    农村剧团是为满足农村文娱生活的群众业余性的文艺组织，它是在自愿的原则下，根据主客观条件利用业余时间特别是农闲时间从事活动的。因此不仅不能妨碍生产，而且应该对生产起推动和鼓舞作用，以达到发展生产、推动工作和活跃农村文化生活的目的。农民群众主要的工作就是搞好生产。如果农村业余剧团不考虑主客观条件，不顾对生产的影响，盲目地向专业化发展，置戏箱、排大戏、跑码头、到处巡回演出，误时，误工，势必铺张浪费，妨碍生产。这就违背了“业余、自愿、为生产服务”的原则而脱离群众。
    （二）农村剧团是否可以演大戏？
    四川很多地区的农村剧团演过“白毛女”、“刘胡兰”、“血泪仇”、“红娘子”等大戏，有的地方用四五个月时间排大戏，向群众派款，甚至置备五六套布景，买手摇发电机打电光。大戏费人、费钱、费时间，一般说来，不适合目前我国农村经济的具体条件。凡是不根据现实条件，凭着少数人的兴趣和愿望排演大戏、古装戏的剧团，妨碍生产，必然引起群众不满。我们的意见是：农村剧团主要应采取省钱，省事，省人的办法，以反映农村现实生活和斗争为主要内容，充分利用群众喜闻乐见的小型多样的艺术形式，比较适宜。
    （三）如何解决演唱材料问题？
    有的农村剧团强调依靠群众“自编”解决演唱材料问题，是值得研究的。群众自己可否进行创作，要看具体情况。当群众生活中涌现出一些新的英雄人物和事迹，农村剧团如有一定创作力量，进行创作是可以的。为了创作得好，应尽可能争取当地优秀的民间艺人合作和当地宣传文教领导机关的指导。但不能把“自编”做为一个方向，也不应普遍这样要求。如果过分强调“自编”，就很容易形成乱编乱改的现象，这样编出来的东西容易犯公式化、概念化的毛病，甚至内容违犯政策。各地宣传文教机关应该有计划地组织和领导材料供应工作。要求专业的文艺工作者们加强和农村业余剧团的联系，多创作一些艺术性思想性较强的短小节目，来供应农村剧团的需要。另一方面，我们祖国有极丰富的民间艺术遗产，为广大群众所喜爱。例如全国流行的狮舞、东北的太平鼓、安徽的花鼓灯、河北的跑驴等民间歌舞，活泼健康，具有很强的人民性，群众非常喜爱，就应大力推广。
    （四）农村剧团的经费问题怎样解决？
    关于农村剧团的经费问题，有的地方农村剧团采取摊派，或变相摊派（如动员乐捐，强迫推销戏票）等方式向群众要钱，这样做法是错误的，脱离群众的。农村剧团的经费应当经过乡村政府同意，在群众自觉自愿的基础上于演出时根据灯油、化装费等实际需要，和群众负担能力收取少量费用。各地领导部门必须加以适当掌握。
