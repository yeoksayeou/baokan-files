Xinhua News Agency, July 1st dispatch from New York: The famous scientist Einstein condemned the American reactionary forces for stifling freedom, and called on American intellectuals not to yield to them.

An American teacher, William Frauenglass, of Manhattan High School, was summoned by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee this April to explain his "Communist connections." He refused to answer the question, and is therefore in danger of being dismissed. He wrote to Einstein, telling him about his refusal to testify and the dangers he faced. Einstein recently wrote back to him, saying: "The problem now facing American intellectuals is an extremely serious one. American reactionary politicians are trying their best to clamor about external dangers in front of the public, making the public suspicious of all activities in the intellectual community. They have succeeded so far, and now they are going further to ban teaching freedom and deprive those who do not obey their orders of their positions."

Einstein went on to say that for the sake of America's "cultural interests," he believes that American intellectuals should deal with the summons of those congressional committees by means of "non-cooperation." He said, "Every intellectual who is summoned to testify before various committees should refuse to testify." He also said that if American intellectuals cannot do this, then they will only suffer "the slavery imposed on them."

Einstein's action immediately aroused attacks from American reactionaries. McCarthy, chairman of the Senate Permanent Investigation Subcommittee, cursed Einstein as "an enemy of the United States" at a press conference.

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st dispatch from TASS, New York, June 30th: According to the "New York Times," the annual meeting of the National Education Association of the United States opened in Miami. At the meeting, Danks, a pastor from Ohio, delivered a speech in which he criticized the Congressional committees for "investigating" the activities of American teachers. Danks said: What is worrisome is "the tyranny that cruelly restricts education." According to the newspaper, the meeting heard a report. The report said: Teachers across the United States are even afraid to discuss issues such as the establishment of social medical facilities, race relations, local politics, and United Nations activities in the classroom.

    号召美国知识分子不要对美国反动势力屈服
    【新华社一日讯】纽约消息：著名科学家爱因斯坦谴责美国反动势力扼杀自由，号召美国知识分子不要对它们屈服。
    美国曼哈顿高等学校的一位教师威廉·弗劳恩格拉斯今年四月间受到参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯，要他说明他的“共产党关系”。他拒绝回答这个问题，因而有被解职的危险。他曾写信给爱因斯坦，告诉他拒绝作证的事情和所面临的危险。爱因斯坦最近写信答复他说：“美国知识分子现在所面临的问题是极其严重的问题。美国的反动政客们极力在公众面前叫嚷外来的危险，使公众怀疑知识界的一切活动。他们迄今得逞，现在进而要取缔教学自由，剥夺那些不唯命是听的人的地位。”
    爱因斯坦接着说，为了美国的“文化利益”，他认为美国的知识分子应该以“不合作”的办法来对付那些国会委员会的传讯。他说：“每一个被召到各种委员会去作证的知识分子，都应当拒绝作证。”他并说，如果美国的知识分子不能这样做，那末他们就只有遭受“加给他们的奴役”。
    爱因斯坦的这一行动，立即引起了美国反动派的攻击。参议院常设调查小组委员会主席麦卡锡在记者招待会上大骂爱因斯坦是“美国的敌人”。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社纽约六月三十日讯，据“纽约时报”报道，美国全国教育协会年会在迈阿密开幕。会上俄亥俄州牧师邓克斯发表演说，他在演说中批评了国会委员会“调查”美国教师的活动。邓克斯说：值得担心的是“那种残酷地限制教育事业的暴政”。据报纸报道，会议听取了一个报告。报告中说：美国各地的教师甚至害怕在课堂上讨论像建立社会医疗设施、种族关系、地方政治、联合国活动等一类的问题。
