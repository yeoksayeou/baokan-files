Gao Jiashan and His Comrades
Yang Qi

I
In the days before the battle of "Old Baldy," the cadres of the third company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army were pestered by the bugler Gao Jiashan. This child was just seventeen years old, with a thin but sturdy build, not even as tall as a rifle from head to toe. But this child had the ambition of an adult. When all the comrades in the company were vying to write letters volunteering for combat, he also asked the clerk to write one for him and secretly placed it next to the company commander's pillow when no one was around. This day at dinner, Company Commander Li Zhitang said to Instructor Tao with a smile:
"This little devil, Gao Jiashan, wants to join the assault team too!"
Instructor Tao smiled, squinting his eyes as he sized up Gao Jiashan, who was busy helping them fetch hot water:
"You're not allowed to go!"
Like being doused with a bucket of cold water, Gao Jiashan felt extremely wronged, and he almost shouted:
"Why aren't you letting me go? Instructor!"
Company Commander Li, rubbing his eyes, which were dry from staying up late, said slowly:
"Why? For no reason. Because—you're still young! Understand? You're still young, and when the fighting starts, the company has to leave someone behind to guard the home."
"Guard the home? Always guard the home! No, I want to go!" He became stubborn.
"Not allowed."
"Company Commander, you're always afraid that I'm too small to keep up, but I can keep up! I'm already seventeen years old this year, and soon I'll be eighteen! I already know how to use seven or eight kinds of weapons: rifles, hand grenades, and also demolition charges, light machine guns... I know them all. Besides, I can do communication liaison work, I can blow the bugle."
Company Commander Li believed the child's words, because he had seen Gao Jiashan helping his comrades clean their weapons in peacetime more than once; when training came around, he was always around everyone, asking questions and being very enthusiastic. But now Company Commander Li was considering another problem: what task to assign him? This child was good in every way, the only problem was that he was a bit young. Well, never mind, he has courage, confidence, and drive. So—
"Alright! I'll agree to let you work with me on communication liaison, but you have to know: the battlefield is not as casual as being at home, you have to do whatever work you encounter, and you have to do it well even if you don't know how! Understand? ... Also, you can't 'cry' in difficult situations, you have to resolutely obey orders from above, even if only one person is left, you have to fight the enemy; fight to the end!"
Company Commander Li's words were like nails being driven into wood, one word at a time drilling straight into his heart. Gao Jiashan stood at attention to receive the order, his dark and bright eyes, hiding infinite joy, staring straight at Company Commander Li. The unexpected surprise left him speechless for a moment, he wanted to say "Understood" or "I know" to Company Commander Li, but he didn't say it after all, he stood there for a while, abruptly saluted Company Commander Li, and turned and ran out of the cave.

II
At 8:05 PM on March 23rd, we rained down artillery fire for five minutes, gradually shifting towards the depth of the enemy's Old Baldy position. Gao Jiashan's heart pounded with excitement. In a moment, several assault teams had already rushed up like arrows, following the artillery fire closely. Intense explosions immediately rang out on the front line. Gao Jiashan followed Company Commander Li up the mountain, the bitter and astringent smoke of the shells drilling straight into his lungs. But, just as they were approaching the enemy's front-line position, by the dim moonlight, they discovered that nearly a platoon of Colombian soldiers was swarming down from the hilltop. Company Commander Li looked back and saw that there were only four or five people beside him, so he quickly gave the order to soldier Song Deqing to crawl with hand grenades around the left flank of the enemy; he himself led the other comrades to assault the hilltop from the right flank. The enemy's firepower was getting fiercer and fiercer, the bullets "thudding" close to their feet. Gao Jiashan, following behind, saw that the enemy was getting closer and closer to them, and was about to seize the communication trench five or six meters away from them. At this moment, the little devil suddenly picked up the horn and blew the charge. This ear-piercing sound momentarily stunned the enemy, and the several enemies running in front quickly lay down on the spot to fire at Gao Jiashan, while those behind stood there dumbfounded like pieces of wood. Victory is often decided in the blink of an eye, Song Deqing's hand grenade exploded "boom" in the enemy ranks, and the comrades who had inserted themselves to the right also threw hand grenades one after another into the enemy's formation. A platoon of enemies died or were wounded in this sudden attack; the remaining four or five enemies were also forced down the mountain by our submachine guns and lost their lives in front of our second echelon comrades.

III
At this time, artillery shells were exploding "whoosh, whoosh" on the main peak of No. 16. Company Commander Li led Gao Jiashan and other comrades to continue the assault upwards. When they reached within ten meters of the main peak, Gao Jiashan saw his comrade Zhang Tianxiao in the light of the exploding shells. Both of his legs had been seriously injured, but he had never dropped the red flag that had been torn to shreds by shrapnel; this red flag was his life, his honor. Because when the company gave him this task, he had said to everyone - he must plant this victorious red flag on the main peak of No. 16; but now he was seriously injured and no longer had the strength to continue to complete this glorious task. When Gao Jiashan rushed to him, this tenacious soldier grabbed Gao Jiashan and said:
"Wait a minute - kid!" He pulled the red flag from under his body: "This task is entrusted to you. No matter how difficult the situation, you must plant it on the main peak!"
Gao Jiashan always wanted to find some appropriate words to comfort this wounded comrade, but time did not allow it. He took the red flag with both hands, shook his comrade's hand tightly, got up and rushed towards the hilltop.
Originally, in peacetime, he could cross this distance of a dozen meters in two or three leaps, but it was not so easy on the battlefield. Gao Jiashan had barely taken two steps when several machine guns in the enemy's bunker directly in front of him weaved a wall of fire, blocking his path. Gao Jiashan lay down on the ground with a "whoosh", lowered his body, and continued to crawl forward. Bullets "whizzed" over his head, Gao Jiashan crawled forward inch by inch, not only crawling, but whenever there was a break in the enemy's fire, he would seize the time to get up and dart forward two steps. In this way, after a short while, this clever kid crawled and hopped to the main peak of No. 16. The victorious red flag stood proudly in the smoke, and Gao Jiashan's signal flare also began to fire into the air, the dazzling signal flare, through the smoke and dust, cut through the night sky, telling that the main peak of No. 16 was under our control. A few minutes later, our artillery fire had extended along the ridge that sloped to the right front, turning the last commanding height occupied by the enemy - No. 15 - into a "Mountain of Flames."

IV
On a mountain ridge leading to the No. 15 position, Company Commander Li was suddenly wounded, the bullet coming from a bunker right next to the left side of the communication trench. Gao Jiashan, following behind Company Commander Li, was anxious and sad when he saw the company commander fall, so he straightened up and took advantage of the enemy's pause to dart past the firing port. But immediately afterwards, the enemy's machine gun shot Zhang Jizhu, who was following behind him to rescue the company commander. The shooting became increasingly frantic. At this time, Gao Jiashan, who was hiding under the breastwork of the bunker, could no longer suppress the fire of revenge in his heart. He reached out and pulled out the anti-tank grenade that he had just picked up from a wounded comrade, and crawled close to the entrance of this large bunker. Just then, Company Commander Li also crawled over, enduring the pain. Gao Jiashan first helped him retreat three or four steps behind him, and then returned, aiming at the enemy's entrance and throwing the grenade into it. There was a dull thud, and the large bunker was immediately engulfed in thick smoke and fire.
Soon, the little medic Wang Jinhua had also caught up from behind. Gao Jiashan left him to bandage Company Commander Li's wound together. Company Commander Li's injuries were too serious, and several first-aid kits could not stop the bleeding. Gao Jiashan stood by, staring in a daze at this beloved leader. Suddenly, Company Commander Li twisted his body and wanted to sit up, and the two children quickly helped him to sit up straight.
"Gao Jiashan! Help me stand up! Let me take a good look at No. 15!" Company Commander Li sternly issued the order. As he spoke, he pulled the two children up. At that time, Gao Jiashan had no choice but to support him.
At this time, the waist of No. 15 Mountain, immersed in the night mist, was flashing with explosions. Comrades from the first and third platoons had launched a fierce attack on the stubborn enemy. Gao Jiashan looked at Company Commander Li in the moonlight, only to see him clenching his lips, silently looking at the No. 15 position...
"Please rest assured, Company Commander! Sooner or later, No. 15 hilltop will be ours!" Gao Jiashan said loudly to Company Commander Li.
Company Commander Li nodded silently, and said in a gentle voice that he had never used before:
"Good boy, put me down!..."
Then he fell asleep unconscious on the ground.

V
Soon, the two children continued to attack the countless bunkers on the road to No. 15. In the beginning, Gao Jiashan could not figure out the enemy's weight, and he was always a little flustered in his heart in an emergency, but after they had overturned several enemy bunkers in a row, he really realized that the enemy was just a bunch of cowardly cowards. Now the two children were fighting better and better; they had already learned how to use maneuvering movements to avoid the enemy's firepower, and then how to use submachine guns to block the enemy's firing ports and how to use hand grenades to destroy the enemy's bunkers. But once, just as Wang Jinhua turned on his flashlight to search for ammunition in the communication trench, three foolish, big, dark, and thick Colombian soldiers secretly pounced on them from behind. But just as these three enemies were preparing to rush up to grab the two children, the guy rushing in front was the first to eat a submachine gun bullet from Gao Jiashan. The two behind turned around and ran away desperately, and Gao Jiashan and Wang Jinhua chased after them.
Suddenly, the two enemies disappeared at a turn in a section of the communication trench. Wang Jinhua rushed forward in large strides, and the enemy who had sneaked into a bunker on the left cut off Gao Jiashan and Wang Jinhua with a machine gun from the firing port. Gao Jiashan waited for the enemy to stop shooting, grabbed a hand grenade and threw it at the entrance, but the hand grenade hit the outside and exploded. What's going on? He took a closer look and found that the entrance of this bunker was fitted with a steel plate door. At this time, a black figure of the enemy appeared on top of the bunker; this enemy had climbed out of the bunker's skylight and was throwing hand grenades around. Gao Jiashan lay motionless under the enemy's fire, crawling close to the base of the bunker, thinking: "As long as I don't expose the target, I'll take care of you bastards no matter what."
Sure enough, after a while, the enemy went down into the bunker through the skylight again. Gao Jiashan followed him to the top of the bunker, and just as he was about to throw a hand grenade into the skylight, he heard a "clang" below the skylight and a steel plate cover was pulled over. This made Gao Jiashan anxious, so he quickly ran to the back of the bunker to look for another firing port, but the firing port was also blocked by a steel plate. What to do? Leave it for the comrades coming from behind to fight, but who knows how many more comrades will be injured or killed! But to blast from outside this large bunker, the two hand grenades in hand were not enough to solve the problem. No matter what, "Difficulties cannot defeat a Volunteer Army soldier!" Gao Jiashan suddenly remembered what the instructor usually told them, he crawled on top of the bunker and thought and thought, suddenly he had an idea, he deliberately rubbed the stones on the top rear of the bunker with his feet to make a rustling sound, and at the same time leaned down and tapped on the steel plate of the rear firing port with his hand. Sure enough, the machine gun that was firing in front suddenly stopped firing, and the rear firing port opened, and the machine gun poked out a gun barrel from inside and fired wildly. Gao Jiashan's heart was so happy that he almost jumped out, so he rushed to the front in three steps and threw two hand grenades into the firing port that had not had time to be covered. The machine gun in the bunker went silent with two bursts of explosions, and the several cunning enemies were finally blown to death in this turtle shell.

VI
That night, bugler Gao Jiashan used his brave and resourceful tactical movements to eliminate the enemy's seven bunkers one after another, wiping out nearly fifty enemies. It was not until all of "Old Baldy's" positions were occupied by us that this kid dragged his tired body and carried four submachine guns that he had picked up, withdrawing from the position on orders. At this time, it was almost dawn, and a touch of red was painted on the eastern sky. Gao Jiashan went back along the way he had come, checking in turn the bunkers that had been shattered by his hard fighting, these bunkers that the enemy had built for more than a year and boasted as "impregnable permanent fortifications", but under the attack of the Volunteer Army warriors, they were all destroyed in one night. Gao Jiashan tasted the happy feeling of a victor for the first time.

    高家善和他的战友们
    杨奇
    一
    “老秃山”战斗的前几天，志愿军某部三连的几个干部叫司号员高家善缠上了。这个孩子今年刚满十七岁，瘦瘦的但又是很结实的身材，齐头到脚也没有支步枪高。可是这孩子却有着一颗大人的雄心，在全连同志都争着写求战书的时候，他也请文书同志给代写了一张，趁没人的时候偷偷地放到连长的枕头旁边。这天吃晚饭的时候，连长李志堂笑着对陶指导员说：
    “高家善这小鬼也要参加突击队哩！”
     陶指导员笑了笑，眯起眼睛来端详着正在忙着替他们打开水的高家善：
    “不准你去！”
    像劈头浇了一瓢冷水似的，高家善觉得受了极大的委屈，他差点没大声喊出来：
    “为什么不让我去？指导员！”
    李连长揉着自己的那对因熬夜而干涩的眼睛，慢条斯理地说着：
    “为什么？不为什么。因为——你还小哩！懂吧！你年纪还轻，等打起仗来的时候，连里也得留人看家。”
    “看家？又是看家！不，我要去！”他执拗起来。
        “不准。”
    “连长，你老怕我人小跟不上，可是我能跟得上啊！我今年已经十七岁了，很快就是十八岁啦！我现在已经会用七、八种武器了：步枪、手榴弹，还有爆破筒、轻机枪……都会。另外，我还可以做通讯联络工作，我会吹号。”
    李连长相信这个孩子的话，因为在平时，他曾不止一次地看到高家善在班里帮同志们擦洗武器；赶上练兵，他总是在大家的身边转，问长问短，挺热心。可是现在李连长却考虑着另外一个问题：分配给他个什么任务呢？这孩子一切都好，唯一的问题是年纪小了点。唔，不要紧，他有勇气，有信心，有干劲儿。那么——
    “好吧！就答应你跟我做通讯连络工作，但你要知道：在战场上可不比在家里这么随便，碰上什么情况就要干什么工作，不会干的也要干，而且要干的好！明白吧？……还有，在困难情况下可不能
    ‘哭鼻子’，要坚决地服从上级的命令，就是剩下一个人也要跟敌人干；干到底！”
    李连长的话就像是钉子钉进了木头一样，一个字一个字地直往心眼里钻。高家善立正站着接受命令，那双乌黑晶亮的隐藏着无限喜悦的眼睛直盯着李连长。出乎意料外的惊喜一时使他说不出话来，他本想向李连长说句“明白了”或是“知道了”，但他终究没有说出来，他站着呆了一会，猛地向李连长行了个举手礼，一扭身子就朝洞子外面跑出去了。二
    三月二十三日下午八时五分，我们狂风暴雨似地打了五分钟的炮火，渐渐地移向了敌人老秃山阵地的纵深。高家善的心激动得一股劲儿地跳。一会儿，几个突击队已经像箭一样地紧跟着炮火冲上去了，前沿上顿时响起了一阵激烈的爆炸声。高家善跟着李连长往山上跑去，又苦又涩的炮弹烟子直往肺叶里钻。可是，正当他们刚刚接近敌人前沿阵地的时候，借着昏朦的月色，发现将近个把排的哥伦比亚兵正从山头上蜂拥着下来了。李连长回过头来看看，见身旁只有四、五个人了，他就连忙传命令给战士宋德清，要他抱手雷顺左翼往敌人的侧后摸；他自己就带上另外的几个同志从右翼往山头上突击。敌人的火力越来越凶了，子弹贴近他们几个人的脚底下直“秃噜”。高家善跟在后面，见敌人离他们越来越近了，而且眼看着就要抢占那条离他们五、六公尺远的交通沟了。就在这时，这个小鬼忽然拿起喇叭就向敌人吹起冲锋号来。这阵刺耳的号音一下子把敌人蒙住了，跑在前面的几个敌人就赶紧就地卧倒，朝高家善开枪，跟在后面的就像些木头一样地站在那里发愣。胜利往往就决定在这么一眨眼的功夫，宋德清的手雷“轰”地一声在敌群中爆炸了，顺右面插上去的同志们，也接二连三地把手榴弹投在敌人的队伍里。一个排的敌人就在这种突然的打击下死的死了，伤的伤了；剩下来的四、五个敌人，也被我们用冲锋枪压到山底下，在我们的第二梯队同志的面前丧了命。三
    这时，十六号主峰上正在“呼通”“呼通”地响着炮弹爆炸的声音。李连长带着高家善和其他几个同志继续往上突击。赶到离主峰十几公尺远的时候，高家善在炮弹爆炸起来的火光中，看到了战友张天孝，他的两条腿已负了重伤，但他却始终没有丢掉那面已被弹片撕成碎片的红旗；这面红旗就是他的生命，他的荣誉。因为在连上把这个任务交给他的时候，他曾经向大家表示过——一定要把这面胜利的红旗插上十六号主峰；可是现在他负了重伤，已经没有力量来继续完成这个光荣的任务了。当高家善冲到他跟前的时候，这个顽强的战士就一把拉住了高家善说：
    “等一等——小鬼！”他把红旗从身子底下抽出来：“这个任务就交给你了。不管情况怎样困难，你无论如何也要把它插上主峰！”
    高家善总想找些适当的话来安慰这个负了伤的战友，但时间不允许了，他双手接过这面红旗，紧紧地握了一下战友的手，爬起来就往山头冲过去了。
    本来，在平时，这十几公尺远的距离他连跳带蹦三两步就能跨到，可是在战场上却没这么容易。高家善刚走了两步不到，正前方敌人地堡里的几挺机枪，就织起了一道火墙，拦住了他的进路。高家善，“呼”地一声卧倒地上，压低身子，继续往前爬，子弹“丝丝”地掠过他的头顶，高家善一寸一寸地往前爬着，不仅爬着，每当敌人的火力间隙，他就抓紧时间爬起来往前窜两步。就这样，过了不大一会儿，这个机灵的小鬼就连爬带蹦地绕到十六号主峰上了。胜利的红旗在硝烟中骄傲地竖立起来了，高家善的信号枪也开始对空发射了，光彩夺目的信号弹，透过烟尘，划破夜空，告诉十六号主峰已经在我们的控制之下了。几分钟以后，我们的炮火已经沿着那条斜向右前方的山脊延伸，把敌人盘据着的最后的一个制高点——十五号打成了“火焰山”。四
    在攻向十五号阵地的一个山梁上，李连长突然负了伤，子弹从紧挨交通沟左侧的一个地堡里射来。跟在李连长身后的高家善见连长倒下来了，心里又急又难过，就一挺身子趁敌人愣下来的时候窜过那个射口。可是紧接着，敌人的机枪又把跟在他后面抢救连长的张继柱打挂彩了，射击也越来越疯狂了。这时在地堡胸墙下面隐蔽着的高家善，再也压不住那股复仇怒火，他就一伸手从腰上拉出来那颗刚刚从负伤战友身上捡来的反坦克用的手雷，贴地爬回了这个大地堡的洞口附近。正当这时，李连长也忍着疼痛爬过来了。高家善先帮他往身后撤了三、四步，然后又返回去，对准敌人的那个洞口把那颗手雷摔了进去。只听得一声沉闷的巨响，那座大地堡里顿时腾起了浓烟烈火。
    不一会儿，小卫生员王锦华也已经从后面赶上来了。高家善就留下他一块儿给李连长包伤口，李连长的伤势太重了，一连上了几个急救包都止不住血。高家善守在一旁望着这个令人敬爱的首长发怔。忽然，李连长一扭身子就想坐起来，两个小鬼就连忙把他扶得坐稳。
    “高家善！快扶我站起来！让我好好地看看十五号！”李连长严厉地下着命令。一面说一面就拉着这两个小鬼的身子往起站。当时，高家善只好把他架起来了。
    这时，沉浸在夜雾里的十五号山腰部，闪着一片爆炸的火光。一排和三排的同志已经对顽抗的敌人发起了猛攻，高家善在月光下看着李连长，只见他紧闭着嘴唇，一声不吭地向十五号阵地望着……
    “请连长放心吧！十五号山头早晚会是我们的！”高家善大声地对李连长说。
    李连长默默地点了点头，用着从来未有过的温和的声音说：
        “好孩子，放下我吧！……”
    接着他就昏迷不醒地睡在地上了。五
    不一会儿，这两个小鬼又继续在通向十五号的前进道路上，对那些数不清的地堡群施行攻击了。在开始，高家善还摸不透敌人的斤两，临到紧急的时候心里总是有点慌，可是当他们一连打翻了几个敌人的地堡以后，他才真正认识到敌人到底还是一些怕死的松包。现在这两个小鬼越打越出色了；他们已经懂得了怎样用迂回的动作来避开敌人的火力，然后又怎样用冲锋枪去封锁敌人的射口和怎样用手雷去炸毁敌人的地堡。可是有一次，正当王锦华打开手电筒在交通沟里搜寻弹药的时候，三个傻大黑粗的哥伦比亚兵就偷偷地从他们的背后扑过来了。可是就在这三个敌人准备冲上来抓这两个小鬼的时候，闯在前面的那个家伙就首先吃了高家善的一颗冲锋枪子弹，走在后面的两个扭回头拚命地跑开了，高家善和王锦华就跟着它们的屁股追。
    忽然，那两个敌人在一截交通沟的拐弯处不见了。王锦华大步流星地一路赶过去，钻进左侧一个地堡里去的敌人，就从射口里用机枪把高家善和王锦华两个切断了。高家善等敌人停止射击的时候，抓起个手榴弹来就往洞口里摔，可是手榴弹却一下子碰在外面爆炸了。怎回事呢？他仔细一看，才发现了这个地堡的洞洞里面安装着用钢板做成的门扇。这时，地堡顶上又出现了一个敌人的黑影子；这个敌人是从地堡的天窗上钻出来的，他正往周围丢手榴弹。高家善在敌人的火力下一动不动地贴地堡根子爬着，心想：“只要我不暴露目标，好歹我要把你们这伙王八蛋们收拾了的。”
    果然，过了不一会儿，那个敌人又顺天窗下到地堡里去了。高家善紧跟着他爬到地堡顶上，刚要往天窗里投手榴弹，就听到天窗下面又“噹啷”一声拉上了个钢板盖子。这一来可把高家善急坏了，他就连忙跑到地堡后面去找另外的射口，可是后面的射口也堵着钢板。怎么办呢？留下让后面来的同志打吧，那又不知道要增加多少同志的伤亡！但要从这个大地堡外面进行爆破，仅凭手里的这两颗手榴弹是不能解决问题的。不管怎样，“困难是难不倒一个志愿军的！”高家善忽然想起了指导员平时给他们讲的话，他爬在地堡顶上想了又想，忽然灵机一动，就故意用脚在地堡的顶后部擦弄得石头哗啦哗啦地响，一面又探下身子来用手往后面射口的钢板上敲。果然，正在前面射击的那挺机枪突然停止射击了，后面的射口一开，机枪就从里面探出个枪口来慌乱地射击。高家善的一颗心都高兴得要跳出来了，他就三脚两步地赶到前面去，从那个还没有来得及掩盖的射口里摔进了两颗手榴弹。地堡里的机枪随着两阵爆炸声哑下来了，几个狡猾的敌人也终于被炸死在这个乌龟壳里。六
    这一夜，司号员高家善用他的英勇机智的战术动作，先后破除了敌人的七个地堡，歼灭了将近五十个敌人。直到“老秃山”的阵地全部被我们占领以后，这个小鬼才拖着个疲乏的身子，背了四支捡来的冲锋枪奉命撤离阵地。这时，天色已经快要亮了，东方的天壁上已涂上了一抹红彩。高家善顺着来路往回返，挨次清查着那些经过自己的苦战而被炸得七零八落的地堡，这些地堡就是敌人修建了一年多并自夸做“攻不破的永久性工事”，但在志愿军勇士们的打击下，一晚上就全部毁灭了。高家善第一次尝到了胜利者的愉快心情。
