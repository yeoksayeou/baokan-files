The serious incident of Yang Maolin, a bad element in the Fourth District, Fourth Township of Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, usurping township political power, engaging in corruption and perverting the law, shielding landlords, and carrying out long-term terror rule over peasants, was exposed in this newspaper (April 13) and the Xi'an Mass Daily, arousing great indignation among the broad masses of people in various places. This newspaper successively received letters from several readers, all demanding that the People's Government severely punish class alien elements such as Yang Maolin and the personnel who violated the law and neglected their duties in connection with this case. At the same time, they unanimously considered the bureaucratic style of leadership in Liquan County to be extremely serious, and demanded that they be given the punishment they deserved. However, at the beginning of the exposure of this case, some county and district leaders in Liquan County still had incorrect understanding of the nature of this illegal landlord agent Yang Maolin and the bureaucratic style of leadership in the county. They believed that the mistakes in the leadership of Liquan County were only due to the general bureaucratic approach of not understanding the situation, and only listening to one-sided statements from lower-level cadres; they believed that "Yang Maolin is loyal and reliable, and works actively and responsibly, but has a bad temper and a bad style." In order to thoroughly clarify the facts, clarify the nature of the bureaucratic style of leadership in Liquan County and the responsibility for this case, and seriously deal with this problem to educate the broad masses of cadres and restore the adverse effects of this incident on the Party among the peasant masses in the township, the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee, together with relevant departments, organized a "Yang Maolin Case Investigation Team" and went to the county to conduct a serious investigation, and published the investigation results continuously in the Xi'an Mass Daily, using specific facts to thoroughly criticize the erroneous thoughts and understandings of these cadres. The investigation results proved that Yang Maolin was not only a lawless and undisciplined element who had consistently used his power to frequently hang, detain, and insult peasants (having beaten and scolded 22 peasants), but also a class enemy who had consistently shielded illegal landlords and maintained the interests of the landlord class; the investigation results proved that some leading cadres in Liquan County (such as Lei Zhaochun, deputy secretary of the county party committee) not only committed the bureaucratic error of not understanding the situation and listening to one-sided statements, but had also developed to the serious extent of losing their class stand and not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves due to blurred class viewpoints and listening to one-sided statements.

    How could a bad element like Yang Maolin, who had committed so many evils, usurp the Party and government leadership in the Fourth District, Fourth Township of Liquan County, and most of the party members in the township branch still support and shield Yang Maolin's crimes, calling him "the only good cadre"? The main reason is that the Party's organizational work in the county did not develop party members in accordance with the Party's organizational principles, and did not seriously examine their political history and ideological situation when party members joined the Party, so that bad elements like Yang Maolin could take the opportunity to infiltrate the Party, causing serious organizational and ideological impurity in the township party branch. For example, during the period when Yang Maolin controlled the leadership of this branch and acted recklessly, there were 22 party members, of whom 15 were old military, police, and baojia personnel before liberation (four had participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League, two had participated in the Kuomintang, and one was a follower of Yiguandao). These people had not undergone ideological transformation before joining the Party, and they all joined the Party with impure motives or even hostile thoughts. Among the township party branch, only five people were party members who truly came from poor peasant families. Secondly, the Party organization lacked regular political and ideological education for party members. The county Party organization had never conducted in-depth and specific inspections of the study of rural party members, and the study system was very unsound, which greatly affected the improvement of the political consciousness of peasant party members. The party members in the branch who had relatively pure thoughts and relatively upright work styles adopted the attitude of "not concerning themselves with matters and hanging high" because of their low political awareness. Although they did not approve of Yang Maolin's actions, they did not dare to directly express their opposition, which gave bad elements the opportunity to control the leadership of the party branch for a long time.

    After nearly two months of in-depth investigation by the inspection team, the details of the Yang Maolin case have been completely clarified. Now, the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee has made a decision on the punishment of the relevant party member cadres who have made mistakes, which has been approved by the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee. The main contents of this punishment decision are as follows:

    First, Yang Maolin: A native of the Fourth District, Fourth Township of Liquan County, from a hooligan background, he served as the deputy company commander of the Kuomintang bandit army for more than ten years before liberation. After the liberation of Liquan, he pretended to be progressive, fabricated his history, and usurped the position of township head of the Fourth District, Fourth Township, and joined the Communist Party in 1950. From then on, Yang Maolin used his power to openly shield landlords and undermine the peasant movement, so that although the township had undergone "land reform" and "land surveying and production determination," the peasants were still oppressed by the landlords. When the peasants automatically rose up to struggle, Yang Maolin tried his best to frame good people, and he personally tied up and tortured more than 20 peasants. He arrested and detained peasant activist Gao Yanxi for no reason on the charge of "falsely accusing the township head" and illegally struggled against Li Fengji and others who actively appealed. When the masses appealed one after another, he repeatedly deceived the leadership, falsely reported work achievements, falsely accused good people as "bad people," and openly obstructed and sabotaged the inspection of the higher-level work team. His actions fully show that he is actually an agent of the landlord class in the Party and the government, and a bad element who infiltrated the Party and opposes the Party and the people. Therefore, it is decided to expel him from the Party and recommend that the government severely punish him according to law. Second, Gou Jinghua: A native of Liquan County, currently the deputy secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the CCP Liquan County. Before liberation, he served as the deputy detachment leader of the pseudo-Three People's Principles Youth League. He consistently supported and shielded Yang Maolin's criminal activities, and participated in Yang Maolin's framing of Li Fengji and other peasants who exposed his crimes. When the higher authorities decided to punish Yang Maolin, Gou Jinghua also said that "the higher authorities support bad people and attack cadres." Gou Jinghua has consistently violated laws and disciplines and refused to mend his ways after repeated education, which fully shows that his character is extremely bad and he has lost the basic conditions of a Communist Party member. Therefore, it is decided to expel him from the Party. Third, Li Jingming: A native of Liquan County, who infiltrated the Communist Party in 1949, was recruited by Yang Maolin to serve as a primary school teacher, because his ideological and work performance has always been very bad, he has not yet been converted into a full party member. He is Yang Maolin's strong accomplice. After Yang Maolin was taken into custody by the government, he also instigated Li Zhizheng and others to steal the name of the party branch and personally draft a false certificate, attempting to deceive the higher authorities; at the same time, he spread rumors and threatened the masses. Li Jingming is a political opportunist who infiltrated the Party. It is decided to revoke his qualification as a probationary party member. Fourth, Ma Mingyu: A native of Liquan County, formerly a Kuomintang member and a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, who served as the secretary of the pseudo-police bureau in Hu County. He joined the Communist Party in the winter of 1949, and is now a primary school teacher. Because of his consistently poor performance, he has not yet been converted into a full party member. He has consistently protected Yang Maolin, and has repeatedly written false certificates to the CCP Liquan County Committee and the Liquan County People's Government, and forged documents under Yang Maolin's instructions to frame peasant Gao Chun. This person's character is extremely bad and cannot be reformed. It is decided to revoke his qualification as a probationary party member. Fifth, Yang Wenzhang: A native of Liquan County, who joined the Communist Party in 1949. Because of his bad ideological character, he has not yet been converted into a full party member. He participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Kuomintang before liberation and has not reported to the organization. He colluded with some illegal landlords and Yang Maolin to undermine land reform. He also colluded with bad cadres to frame peasant activist Yang Shifu, causing Yang Shifu to be unjustly detained for seven months. In order to purify the Party organization, it is decided to revoke his qualification as a probationary party member. Sixth, Lei Zhaochun: The current deputy secretary of the Liquan County Party Committee, with a blurred class stand, lacks a mass perspective, turns a blind eye to the sabotage of landlords and bad elements, and is indifferent to the suffering of the people. He has serious bureaucracy, listens to one-sided statements, and even loses his stand, mistakenly attacks the peasants, shields bad elements, and promotes Yang Maolin's illegal behavior, causing serious damage to the cause of the Party and the people. But he made a deep review of his mistakes in the end. It is decided to give him the punishment of removal from work within the Party. Seventh, Kou Banggui: A Communist Party member, the former deputy director of the Liquan County People's Court (now working in the Local Industry Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee). When he worked in Liquan County, due to serious bureaucracy and believing in bad elements such as Yang Wenzhang, he mistakenly detained peasants Yang Shifu, Gao Yanxi, etc., causing damage to the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. It is decided to give him a warning within the Party and recommend appropriate administrative punishment. Eighth, Duan Fuxing: A Communist Party member, the former district head of the Fourth District of Liquan County (now working in the Fenghui Canal Water Conservancy Office in Chang'an County). Due to bureaucracy and lack of a mass perspective, he personally beat peasant Gao Yanxi and sent him to the county for detention. He also arbitrarily sentenced peasant Wang Hengqing to three months of labor service, undermining the Party's policies and government decrees. It is decided to give him a public warning within the Party and recommend appropriate administrative punishment.

    In order to widely educate cadres and the masses, the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee, in late May, took advantage of the gap before the wheat harvest and held a cadres' conference in Liquan County, and also held small-scale mass meetings in various townships to announce the punishment decisions for the people involved in the "Yang Maolin Incident." Through the handling of the Yang Maolin incident, cadres at all levels and the broad masses of people in Liquan County were educated, and their ideological understanding was generally improved. The cadres and masses who participated in the conference all agreed that the handling of the "Yang Maolin Incident" by the higher-level Party was correct and expressed their sincere support. Now, the Party and government leading departments in Liquan County have generally attached importance to the handling of letters from the people, and all agencies and units have designated special personnel to be responsible for handling letters from the people. In order to grasp the situation in a timely manner, the leadership has also established a system of regular inspection, reporting, and summarizing to resolutely achieve "every letter must be answered" and "every case must have a result." Now the Secretariat of the County People's Government has organized two inspection teams to conduct key inspections in various districts and to sort out letters from the masses. In the Fifth District alone, more than 100 letters from the people were processed this time, and more than 30 cases were resolved. Because the county and district leaders attached importance to the work of letters from the people and solved some problems for the masses with a focus, the relationship between the Party organization and the People's Government and the broad masses has been initially improved in the county.

    中共陕西省委纪律检查委员会
    对坏分子杨茂林事件已作严肃处理
    陕西省醴泉县四区四乡坏分子杨茂林，篡夺乡政权，贪污枉法，包庇地主，对农民进行长期恐怖统治的严重事件，在本报（四月十三日）和西安群众日报上被揭发以后，曾激起各地广大人民群众的极大义愤。本报曾先后收到若干读者来信，一致要求人民政府严厉惩办杨茂林等阶级异己分子和与此案有关的违法失职人员，同时对醴泉县领导上的官僚主义作风，一致认为是十分严重的，要求给予应得的处分。但在此案被揭发之初，在醴泉县部分县、区领导同志中，对这一不法地主代理人杨茂林的本质和该县领导上的官僚主义作风，还存在着不正确的认识。认为醴泉县领导上的错误，只是属于一般的不了解下情、偏听偏信下级干部一面之词的官僚主义；认为“杨茂林忠诚可靠，工作积极负责，就是脾气太坏，作风不好”。为了彻底弄清事实真象，弄清醴泉县领导上官僚主义作风的性质和对此案应负的责任，严肃处理此一问题，以教育广大干部和挽回此事给党在该乡农民群众中所造成的不良影响，中共陕西省委纪律检查委员会曾和有关部门共同组织了“杨茂林案调查组”，前赴该县进行了认真的调查，并将调查的情况在西安群众日报上连续发表，用具体事实，彻底地批判了这些干部的错误思想和认识。调查结果证明，杨茂林不但是一个一贯利用职权经常吊打、关押和辱骂农民（曾先后打骂过二十二个农民）的违法乱纪分子，而且还是个一贯包庇不法地主，维护地主阶级利益的阶级敌人；调查结果证明，醴泉县的某些领导干部（如县委副书记雷兆春）不但犯了不了解下情、偏听偏信的官僚主义错误，而且已由阶级观点模糊，偏听偏信，而发展到丧失阶级立场和敌我不分的严重程度。
    像杨茂林这样作恶多端的坏分子，竟能篡夺醴泉县四区四乡的党、政领导，而该乡支部的多数党员，还多方支持和包庇杨茂林的罪行，把他说成为“唯一无二的好干部”，这究竟是什么原因呢？主要是由于该县党的组织工作，没有按照党的组织原则去发展党员，在党员入党时没有认真地审查他们的政治历史和思想情况，致使像杨茂林这样的坏分子能够乘机混进党内，造成该乡党支部存在着严重的组织不纯和思想不纯的现象。如杨茂林在把持这个支部领导、横行无忌时期，共有党员二十二人，其中解放前的旧军、警、保甲人员就有十五人（四人参加过三青团，二人参加过国民党，一人是一贯道徒），这些人在入党前都未经过思想改造，都是带着不纯动机甚至是敌对思想混进党内的。该乡党支部中，只有五个人是真正出身于贫苦农民家庭的党员。其次是党的组织对党员缺乏经常的政治思想教育，该县党组织对农村党员的学习，从未进行过深入具体的检查，学习制度很不健全，这样，大大影响了农民党员政治觉悟的提高。该支部思想比较纯正作风比较正派的党员，由于政治觉悟低，对党支部工作中的问题，多采取“事不关己，高高挂起”的态度，开会不发言，对坏分子杨茂林的所作所为虽不赞成，但也不敢直接提出反对意见，这也就给坏分子以长期把持党支部领导的机会。
    杨茂林案经过检查组将近两个月来的深入检查，案情已全部弄清。现在中共陕西省委纪律检查委员会对有关犯错误的党员干部，已作出处分决定，并经中共陕西省委会批准。这一处分决定的主要内容如下：
    第一，杨茂林：醴泉县四区四乡人，流氓出身，解放前曾任国民党匪军的副连长等职十余年。醴泉解放后，假装进步，伪造历史，窃取了四区四乡乡长职位，并于一九五○年混进共产党内。从此，杨茂林便利用职权公开包庇地主，破坏农民运动，致使该乡虽经“土地改革”、“查田定产”，但农民仍横遭地主压迫。当农民自动起来斗争时，杨茂林又千方百计陷害好人，被他亲手捆绑、拷打的农民即有二十余人。他曾以“诬告乡长”的罪名，将农民积极分子高彦秀无故逮捕扣押，并非法斗争积极上告的李逢吉等。当群众纷纷上告时，他又一再欺骗领导，假报工作成绩，诬好人为“坏人”，并公然阻挠和破坏上级工作组的检查。他的所作所为，充分表明，他实际上是地主阶级在党和政府中的代理人，是混入党内的反党反人民的坏分子，故决定开除其党籍，并建议政府依法严处。第二，苟靖华：醴泉县人，现任中共醴泉县四区区委副书记。解放前曾担任过伪三青团的区分队副。他一贯支持和包庇杨茂林的罪恶活动，并曾参与杨茂林陷害揭发其罪行的农民李逢吉等。当上级决定要处分杨茂林时，苟靖华还说是“上级支持坏人，打击干部。”苟靖华曾一贯违法乱纪，屡教不改，已充分说明他的品质是极端恶劣的，失去了共产党员的起码的条件，故决定开除其党籍。第三，李景明：醴泉县人，一九四九年混入共产党内，由杨茂林私人拉拢任小学教员，因其思想、工作表现一贯很坏，至今尚未转为正式党员。他是杨茂林的有力帮凶。在杨茂林被政府管押后，他还煽动李志正等人，盗用党支部的名义，亲笔起草写假证明信，企图欺蒙上级；同时散布谣言，威胁群众。李景明是混进党内的政治投机分子，决定取消其候补党员资格。第四，马明玉：醴泉县人，原系国民党员、三青团员，曾任鄠县伪警察局书记等职。一九四九年冬加入共产党，现任小学教员，因一贯表现不好，尚未转为正式党员。他一贯袒护杨茂林，曾数次给中共醴泉县委、醴泉县人民政府写假证明信，并在杨茂林的指示下伪造证件，设计陷害农民高纯。此人品质极为恶劣，不堪改造，决定取消其候补党员资格。第五，杨文章：醴泉县人，一九四九年加入共产党，因其思想品质恶劣，至今尚未转为正式党员。解放前参加过三青团、国民党，一直未向组织交代。他曾勾结、拉拢一些不法地主和杨茂林共同破坏土地改革。并勾通坏干部陷害农民积极分子杨世福，致使杨世福含冤被押七个月。为纯洁党的组织，决定取消其候补党员资格。第六，雷兆春：现任醴泉县县委副书记，阶级立场模糊，缺乏群众观点，对地主坏分子的破坏熟视无睹，对人民疾苦漠不关心。他有严重的官僚主义，偏听偏信，以致丧失立场，错误地打击了农民，庇护了坏分子，助长了杨茂林的非法行为，使党和人民的事业受到严重损失。但他最后对错误的检讨较深刻，决定党内予以撤销工作处分。第七，寇邦贵：共产党员，前任醴泉县人民法院副院长（现在西北行政委员会地方工业局工作）。他在醴泉县工作时，由于严重的官僚主义，偏信杨文章等坏分子，因而错误地扣押了农民杨世福、高彦秀等，使党与人民政府的威信受到损失。决定党内予以警告处分，并建议行政上予以适当处分。第八，段复兴：共产党员，前任醴泉县四区区长（现在长安县灃惠渠水利处工作）。由于官僚主义，缺乏群众观点，他曾亲自殴打农民高彦秀，并将他送县关押。他还擅自判处农民王恒清劳役三个月，破坏了党的政策与政府法令。决定党内给予当众警告处分，并建议行政上予以适当处分。
    中共陕西省委纪律检查委员会，为了广泛地教育干部和群众，在五月下旬，趁麦收以前的空隙，在醴泉县召开了干部大会，并在各乡分别召开了小型的群众大会，宣布了对“杨茂林事件”有关人员的处分决定。通过杨茂林事件的处理，教育了醴泉县各级干部和广大群众，普遍提高了思想认识。参加大会的干部和群众都一致认为上级党对“杨茂林事件”的处理是正确的，表示衷心拥护。现在，醴泉县的党、政领导部门，已普遍重视了对人民来信的处理工作，各机关、单位都指定专人负责处理人民来信。领导上为了及时掌握情况，还建立了定期检查汇报、总结等制度，坚决做到“每信必答”、“案案有结果”。现在该县人民政府秘书室已经组织了两个检查组，到各区进行重点检查，清理群众来信。仅在五区这次就处理了一百多件人民来信，解决了三十多件案子。由于县区领导同志重视了人民来信工作，有重点地给群众解决了一些问题，现已初步改善了该县党组织和人民政府与广大群众的联系。
