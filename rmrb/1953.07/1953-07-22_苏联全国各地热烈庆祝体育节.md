Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet Union celebrated Soviet Sports Day throughout the country on the 19th.

    A grand sports meet was held at the "Dynamo" Stadium in Moscow, with 70,000 spectators in attendance. The sports meet began with a review. More than a thousand athletes, representing millions of Soviet athletes, marched in neat formations. The white, red, blue, and green jerseys in the parade created a beautiful picture. The famous athletes at the front, their chests gleaming with medals won in sports competitions, were particularly eye-catching. Following them was a group of sun-tanned young athletes. Next came displays of precision movements, acrobatics, gymnastics, track and field events, ball games, model airplane performances, and other wonderful sports programs. At the same time, swimming, diving, water polo, cycling, motorcycle races, and other events were held at the Khimki swimming station and other sports fields and parks near Moscow. Athletes from the German Democratic Republic and Hungary, who participated in the recent international diving competition in Moscow, also gave excellent performances. During the Sports Day games, female relay runners set two new world records. In the four-person 800-meter relay, V. Kalashnikova and others achieved a time of 1 minute 39 seconds, 0.7 seconds faster than the world record set by Soviet athletes in 1951. In the three-person 2,400-meter relay, D. Barakhovich and others achieved a time of 6 minutes 35.6 seconds, 2.8 seconds faster than the previous world record set by the Soviet team. On the same day, Soviet athlete L. Shcherbakov set a world record of 16 meters 23 centimeters in the triple jump championship held in Moscow, one centimeter higher than the record set by Brazilian athlete Da Silva at the 15th International Olympic Games.

    The Leningrad Sports Day was held at the Kirov Stadium. After a grand sports review, mass competitions were held by precision athletes, track and field athletes, and cyclists, and jockeys and swordsmen also gave various performances.

    Celebrations for Sports Day were also held in the capitals of the Soviet Union's constituent republics. In Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, a grand review was held at the Khrushchev Stadium. This was followed by track and field events and traditional car races.
