This Is How a Hero Is Born
Zhao Zhongxin

I.

Lin Bingyuan joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in July 1951. Upon arriving in Korea, he was assigned as a messenger to a platoon in an artillery company. He was bright, clever, simple, and honest, and everyone in the company liked him.

One day, the company political instructor called Lin Bingyuan to the company headquarters and said to him, "Comrade Lin Bingyuan, our company only has one barber, and he's too busy with shaving and haircuts. The company has decided to send you to learn barbering. Do you have any objections?" Lin Bingyuan immediately replied, "Instructor, I came to resist America and aid Korea. I will do whatever the motherland needs me to do. I have no objections." The instructor was very happy to hear this cheerful answer from a new soldier who had just left his motherland and parents. He said to Lin Bingyuan, "Then you can go tomorrow. You must study hard. The soldiers are all hoping you'll learn quickly and come back to give them haircuts!"

Lin Bingyuan saluted the instructor and turned to leave. The instructor watched the back of this lovely new soldier, thinking silently, "He's a really good soldier. He's sure to be good in battle." The instructor particularly loved these new soldiers who had come from the motherland. Seeing them, he felt that the company was full of new strength. Once, he said to the company commander, "Commander, what do you think is the most precious thing the motherland has given us?" The company commander replied without hesitation, "Everything the motherland supports us with is precious!" The instructor said, "I agree with you, but I think the most precious thing is the loving sons the mothers of the motherland have sent – this batch of new soldiers who have come to our company." The company commander nodded slightly and smiled after hearing the instructor's words. Then he said to the instructor, "I deeply feel that these new soldiers are the most precious. Take Lin Bingyuan, for example. Once I asked him, 'You just left your parents and came to Korea. Don't you miss home?' He said, 'Commander, I volunteered to resist America and aid Korea. When I enlisted, I wanted to come, and my second brother wanted to come too. My father even helped my second brother speak up. Father said: You're young, your second brother knows the suffering our family endured in the past, and he also knows the happiness our family enjoys now, so let your second brother go!' 'Then what did you say to your father that made him let you come?' I asked. Lin Bingyuan said, 'I said to my father: Don't look at me as small, I know the suffering too, and I know the happiness even more. If I didn't know this, why would I be fighting to resist America and aid Korea!' So, my father had no choice but to let me come.'"

After the company commander told the instructor about these situations, he continued, "These new soldiers all know what honor is and who they should hate and love."

The instructor added, "It is precisely because of this that we can defeat the enemy and achieve victory in resisting America and aiding Korea."

Before long, Lin Bingyuan became a barber greatly loved by the soldiers.

However, soon after, due to needs, Lin Bingyuan was transferred to the infantry company to be a soldier. He excitedly accepted this transfer, feeling that his responsibility was even greater. In the construction of fortifications, he was willing to endure hardship and work hard. In learning to master weapons, he humbly asked veteran soldiers for advice and studied diligently. Before long, he learned to use rifles, submachine guns, grenades, hand mines, and demolition tubes.

After becoming an infantry soldier, two things kept him from being calm and made him have a strong desire to perform meritorious service for the motherland. One was shortly after he arrived in the infantry company, he happened to attend a celebration meeting. At the meeting, combat heroes Cui Jianguo and Miao ethnic hero Liu Xingwen gave reports on their heroic deeds. Lin Bingyuan listened, which made him admire these heroes from the bottom of his heart and yearn for the path of heroes. After attending this meeting, he thought at night, "Liu Xingwen is only eighteen years old, and he was able to make a special contribution to the motherland and become a hero. Why can't I do it? I definitely can!"

The other was: Last summer, Lin Bingyuan's second brother wrote to his younger brother saying, "Many heroes have come from Sichuan, and several people who went to Korea with you have also sent good news home. Our father and mother are hoping that you can send good news home soon." His brother's letter also asked him, "I joined the New Democratic Youth League in April. I wonder if you've joined the League yet?" After reading the letter, Lin Bingyuan thought, "You joined the League in April, and I joined in March. What about good news?..." Thinking of this, he felt a little uneasy, but then he thought, "I will definitely send it home."

II.

Late at night on November 3, 1952, the gunfire on the No. 2 position of the 597.9 Highland of Shangganling, which had been fiercely fought over all day, began to die down. In the reflection of the artillery fire, one could still see the undissipated plumes of smoke and the strangely shaped frontline land that had been turned over by the shelling. The Ninth Platoon of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, where Lin Bingyuan was located, had been defending the position here for the third day and night. Some of the comrades in the platoon had died heroically, and some had been seriously wounded. Only Lin Bingyuan and fire team leader Ma Zhenbin were able to continue fighting. At this time, taking advantage of the lull in the battle, Lin Bingyuan leaned against the position, stretching his extremely tired body. This kind of fatigue seemed to have not existed at all during the intense battle, and it only suddenly struck him now. However, he did not sleep. He was thinking, completely immersed in the memories of the past few days. The words of his beloved platoon leader Luo Qicai after he was seriously wounded rang in his ears: "Comrade Lin Bingyuan, I was seriously wounded before I could complete the task assigned by the superiors. You are a member of the Youth League, you must unite with the communist party member Huang Zhihui to unite all the soldiers of the platoon and complete the task of defending the position!" The image of the communist party member Huang Zhihui, who was always so amiable and kind to his comrades and so brave and fearless in fighting the enemy, reappeared before his eyes. He seemed to see again the moment when Huang Zhihui dug open the entrance of the tunnel destroyed by the enemy that morning and was the first to rush out. "Wherever it is difficult, communist party members and Youth League members should go there!" These words, which Huang Zhihui often used to encourage himself and others, once again stirred Lin Bingyuan's heart. Then, the scene when the instructor issued orders to their platoon; the scene when the instructor gave him the task of defending the tunnel; the scene when he was not calm during his first battle, and Ma Zhenbin guided him on how to eliminate more enemies; the scene when he was wounded in the head, Ma Zhenbin persuaded him to return to the tunnel to rest, and he insisted on not leaving the front line, as well as the battle scenes of the past few days, appeared in his mind one by one. Thinking of these things, his spirit became tense again, forgetting the hunger, fatigue, pain from his wounds, and the cold of the night. He watched the enemy's movements, preparing to meet a more intense battle.

On the morning of the 5th, the enemy gathered two regiments of troops and launched a counterattack on the 597.9 Highland, two platoons of which charged towards the No. 2 position. Lin Bingyuan and Ma Zhenbin were hidden in two shell craters on the mountain ridge, and the enemy's activities below the mountain could be seen clearly. He saw about two platoons of enemies crowded together at the foot of the mountain. The officers in the rear shouted, and the soldiers in the front crawled forward a step, crawling so slowly, and with each step they had to lift their heads to look around, sometimes tilting their helmets up a little, and sometimes quickly pulling them down again. Taking advantage of the enemy's approach, Lin Bingyuan threw two hand grenades. In the loud explosions, the enemy was immediately thrown into chaos, pushing and shoving, and turning into a mess. Then, Lin Bingyuan and Ma Zhenbin continued to throw grenades into the enemy ranks. The enemy died or fled, and the counterattack prepared for the whole day was thus defeated.

It was in this battle, in which more than half of the enemy's two platoons were annihilated, that Lin Bingyuan's comrade Ma Zhenbin was also wounded. Lin Bingyuan swore to Ma Zhenbin, "Team leader Ma, you taught me my combat experience. As long as I am here, the position is here. I must avenge you!"

As soon as the battle ended, Lin Bingyuan returned to the tunnel to report the situation to the instructor. After the instructor warmly encouraged him, he said to him seriously, "Comrade Lin Bingyuan, we have been defending here for almost four days and four nights. Our brotherly units supporting us will be here soon. Even if there is only one person left, we must fight on. The people of the motherland are watching us, the people of Korea are watching us, you must hold on to the end!" After speaking, the instructor handed Lin Bingyuan a pot of water that had been saved and an apple that the chief of staff had asked a comrade delivering ammunition to bring to him. Lin Bingyuan refused to take it, saying, "Instructor, we still rely on you to direct the battle! You should eat it!" The instructor said in a commanding tone, "You must eat it, because you still have more arduous tasks to complete."

Lin Bingyuan accepted the pot of water and the apple like accepting an order and returned to the tunnel entrance.

At noon, an enemy reinforced company, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a frantic counterattack again, stormed the mountain, occupied most of the surface position of No. 2, and detoured toward the only tunnel entrance that could launch an attack. At this critical moment of life and death, Lin Bingyuan threw several grenades in succession, braved the smoke and dust, rushed out of the tunnel entrance, and rolled into a shell crater to hide. At this time, two comrades from a brotherly unit also crawled over from the back mountain to support him. The enemy spotted them, and 60mm mortar shells were fired one after another, exploding near them. The dense smoke from the shell explosions made it difficult for them to breathe; the bullets from the enemy's automatic rifles and carbines were also fired densely. The shell crater was very shallow, making it difficult to hide, and one of his comrades who came to support him was wounded again. At this time, Lin Bingyuan thought, "In order to defend the position and protect the wounded comrades in the tunnel, I can't just huddle here." So, he lowered his voice and said to the comrade next to him, "Hiding is not a solution. I'm going to rush out and take back the position." The comrade said, "Okay! You rush! I'll cover you." Lin Bingyuan said, "If I have to sacrifice, you must resolutely hold the position!" Saying that, he stood up, waved his arms and threw out two grenades, and rushed towards the enemy ranks in the smoke. The enemy was stunned by this surprise attack. Lin Bingyuan quickly grabbed a single-person foxhole and threw grenades into the enemy ranks in front of him. Piles of enemies fell, and the rest desperately fled down the mountain. The enemy's supervising team in the rear did not allow those in front to retreat, so those in front waved their gun butts to hit those in the rear, and some jumped over the people behind them and retreated downwards. Looking at the cowardly and embarrassed appearance of the enemy, Lin Bingyuan felt as if all his strength was surging outwards. He couldn't relax, and taking advantage of the billowing smoke, he chased after them closely. When his own grenades ran out, he picked up the grenades thrown down by the enemy and threw them at the enemy one after another. The enemy surged to the left, and the left was a cliff, and some lost their footing and fell down; the enemy surged to the right again, and the machine guns on our No. 8 position on the right also started firing; when our artillery observers discovered that the enemy was in a chaotic mess, the artillery immediately opened fire to block the enemy's retreat. In this way, the enemy's reinforced company that vainly attempted to seize the No. 2 position was mostly buried in front of the heroic No. 2 position.

In the evening, the glow of the setting sun reflected the smoke of gunpowder, and the unyielding 597.9 Highland stood proudly. After fighting continuously with the enemy for four days and four nights and eliminating more than 140 enemies, the young soldier Lin Bingyuan, covered in mud, his eyes covered with bloodshot, and his face blackened by the smoke of gunpowder, but his spirit did not show any fatigue.

In the evening, when brotherly units came to reinforce them, Lin Bingyuan was ordered to leave the position.

III.

Not long ago, this special-class merit citation recipient, second-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, along with a group of young comrades-in-arms, came to Beijing from the Korean front to attend the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, recently held in Beijing. On June 26, when this young hero appeared on the rostrum of the conference and reported his heroic deeds to the comrades attending the conference, a storm of applause rang out from the stage. People welcomed this soldier who defended peace and defended the motherland with infinite joy and admiration. The "First-Class Soldier Honor Medal" on the chest of the young hero Lin Bingyuan shone with the brilliance of youth. This is the brilliance of victory, the eternal brilliance of the heroic Shangganling position.

    英雄是这样诞生的
    赵忠信
    一
    林炳远是一九五一年七月参加志愿军的。刚到朝鲜，他被分配到某炮兵连的一个排里当通讯员，他聪明伶俐，朴实本分，全连没有人不欢喜他。
    一天，连指导员把林炳远叫到连部，对他说：“林炳远同志，咱们连只有一个理发员，剃头刮脸忙不过来，连里决定让你去学理发，你有什么意见？”林炳远马上回答说：“指导员，我是为抗美援朝来的，祖国需要我干啥，我就干啥，啥意见也没有。”指导员听到这个刚离开祖国，离开父母的新战士的愉快的回答，心里真高兴，就对林炳远说：“那么你明天就去吧，去了要好好学，战士们都盼望着你快点学会，回来给他们理发哩！”
    林炳远向指导员敬了个礼，转身走了，指导员目送着这位可爱的新战士的背影，心里默默地想：“真是个好战士，打起仗来一定也错不了。”指导员特别喜爱这批新从祖国来的新战士，一看见他们，他就觉着连里充满着新生的力量。有一次他向连长说：“连长，你说祖国献给我们的什么最可贵？”连长毫不迟疑地说：“凡是祖国支援我们的东西都可贵！”指导员说：“我同意你的意见，但我觉得最可贵的还是：祖国的母亲们献出的她们的爱子——来到我们连的这批新战士。”连长听了指导员这番话，微微地点点头笑了。接着跟指导员说：“要说新战士最可贵，我也深深地体会这一点，拿林炳远来说吧，有一次我问他：‘你刚离开父母，来到朝鲜，你不想家吗！’他说：‘连长，我是争着抗美援朝来的，参军时，我要来，我二哥也要来，我父亲还帮着二哥说话，父亲说：你年纪小，你二哥知道咱家过去受的苦，也知道咱家现时享的福，还是让你二哥去吧！’‘那么你怎样跟父亲说，他又让你来了呢？’我问了一句，林炳远又说：‘我跟父亲说：不要看我小，苦我也知道，福我更知道，不知道这个，我为什么争着去抗美援朝啊！这样，父亲没办法，就让我来了。’”
    连长向指导员说了这些情况以后，接着说：“这些新战士们个个都知道什么是荣誉，应该恨谁、爱谁。”
    指导员补充说：“正因为这样，我们才能够打败敌人，取得抗美援朝的胜利。”
    没有多时，林炳远就成了战士们非常喜爱的理发员了。
    可是不久，由于需要，林炳远又被调到步兵连去当战士去。他兴奋地接受了这次调动，他感到自己的责任更重大了。在修筑工事中，他肯吃苦，卖力气；在学习掌握武器中，他虚心向老战士请教，苦学苦练，没多久，他就学会使用步枪、冲锋枪、手榴弹、手雷和爆破筒等几种武器了。
    他当了步兵战士以后，有两件事使他心里一直不能平静，使他产生了要为祖国立功的强烈愿望。一次是他刚到步兵连不久，正碰上参加庆功大会，会上战斗英雄崔建国和苗族英雄刘兴文作了关于自己英雄事迹的报告，林炳远听了，使他打心眼里敬佩这些英雄，向往英雄们的道路。参加了这次会，夜里他想：“刘兴文才十八岁，他能为祖国立了特功，当了英雄，我为什么不能做到呢，一定能！”
    另一次是：去年夏天，林炳远的二哥来信向他弟弟说：“我们四川出了不少的英雄，跟你一块去朝鲜的，也有好几个人捎了喜报回家了，咱父亲和母亲都望着你能早点寄个喜报来，”哥哥的信上还问他说：“我四月里已经加入了新民主主义青年团，不知你入了团没有？”林炳远看了信，心想：“你四月里入团的，我三月里就入团了。喜报呢？……”他想到这里，心里有些不安了，不过他又想：“我一定会寄回家去的。”
    二
    一九五二年十一月三日深夜时分，激战竟日的上甘岭五九七点九高地的二号阵地上的炮火稀落下来了。在炮火的反光中，还可以看到没有消散的卷卷烟尘和打得翻了过来的奇形怪状的阵地前沿的土地。林炳远所在的志愿军某部九连九班，坚守这里的阵地已经进入第三个昼夜。班里的同志有的壮烈牺牲，有的身负重伤，能够坚持作战的只有林炳远和火力班长马振斌了。这时，林炳远乘着战斗的空隙，斜依在阵地上舒展着十分疲困的身体，这种疲困在紧张的战斗中好像根本不曾存在，只有现在才突然袭来。不过，他并没有睡，他在想，他完全沉在几天来的回忆中了。他的亲爱的班长罗起才受了重伤以后的话在他的耳边鸣响：“林炳远同志，我没有完成上级交给的任务就受了重伤了，你是青年团员，你要和共产党员黄智辉一起团结全班战士，完成坚守阵地的任务！”对待同志总是那样和蔼亲切，打起敌人总是那样勇敢无畏的共产党员黄智辉的形象，又在他的眼前浮现了，他仿佛又看到当天早上黄智辉挖开敌人炸毁的坑道口，第一个冲了出去的那一刹那。“那里艰苦，共产党员和青年团员就应该到那里去！”这句黄智辉经常自勉而又勉人的话，又一次激动着林炳远的心。接着指导员给他们班发布命令时的情景；指导员交给他坚守坑道任务时的情景；自己初次作战不沉着，马振斌指导他如何更多地消灭敌人的情景；他头部受了伤，马振斌劝他回坑道休息，他坚持不离火线的情景以及连日来战斗的场面一幕一幕地在他脑海里出现了。想起这些，他的精神又紧张起来，忘记了饥饿、疲困、伤口的疼痛和深夜的寒冷，他注视着敌人阵地的动静，准备迎接更激烈的战斗。
    五日早晨，敌人纠集了两个团的兵力向五九七点九高地反扑，其中有两个排的兵力向二号阵地冲来。林炳远和马振斌分别隐蔽在山嘴上的两个炮弹坑里，山下敌人的活动，看得清清楚楚。他看到约两个排的敌人在山坡下挤作一团，后边的军官哇啦哇啦地叫一阵，前面的士兵就向前爬一步，爬的那样慢，每爬一步，又要抬起头来张望一下，一会把钢盔仰起一些，一会又赶紧拉下来。林炳远趁着敌人快爬近的时候，顺手投出两个手雷，在隆隆的爆炸声中，敌人马上乱了套，前挤后拥，搅成一个疙瘩，接着林炳远和马振斌又把手榴弹继续向敌群中扔去，敌人死的死，逃的逃，准备了一天的反扑，就这样被击溃了。
    就在这次歼灭敌人两个排的一大半的战斗里，林炳远的战友马振斌也负了伤。林炳远向马振斌宣誓似地说：“马班长，我的作战经验，是你教给我的，有我一人在，就有阵地在，我一定要为你报仇！”
    战斗刚结束，林炳远就回到坑道里去向指导员报告情况。指导员亲切地鼓励了他一番以后，又严肃地对他说：“林炳远同志，我们已经在这里快坚守了四天四夜，支援我们的兄弟部队很快就要来了，就是剩下一个人也要打下去，祖国人民在看着我们，朝鲜人民在看着我们，你要坚守到底！”说完，指导员把保存下来的一壶水，和营参谋长让送弹药的同志带给他的一个苹果递给林炳远，林炳远怎么也不肯接，他说：“指导员，我们还靠你指挥打仗哩！ 还是你吃了吧！”，指导员命令似地说：“你一定要吃了它，因为你还要完成更艰巨的任务。”
    林炳远像接受命令一样接受了那一壶水和一颗苹果，又回到了坑道口。
    中午时分，敌人一个加强连，在炮火掩护下，又发动了疯狂的反扑，攻上了山头，侵占了二号表面阵地的大部分，而且向唯一能出击的那个坑道口迂回冲击过来。在这生死关头，林炳远连续投出了几个手榴弹，冒着烟尘，纵身冲出了坑道口，滚到一个炮弹坑里隐蔽起来，这时，兄弟部队的两个战友也从后山爬过来支援他，敌人发觉了，六○炮弹一个紧接一个的打过来，在他们附近爆炸起来，炮弹爆炸的浓烟，使他们呼吸都感到困难；敌人的自动步枪、卡宾枪的子弹，也密集地射击过来，弹坑很浅，难以掩身，支援他的一个战友又负伤了。林炳远这时想：“为了守住阵地，为了保护坑道里负伤的战友，不能死蹬在这里。”于是，他就压低声音对身边另外一个战友说：“只隐蔽，不是办法，我要冲出去，把阵地夺回来。”那个战友说：“好！你冲！我来掩护你。”林炳远说：“如果我要牺牲了，你要坚决守住阵地！”说着，他挺起身来，挥臂打出两个手雷，冒着烟雾向敌群冲去。敌人被这个突袭吓昏了，林炳远迅速地抓住一个单人掩体，又把手雷向他跟前的敌人群中投去，敌人一堆堆地倒下去，剩下的没命地向山下逃。后面敌人的督战队，不让前面的退，前面的就抡起枪柄打后面的，有的就从后面人的身上跳过去向下退，林炳远看着敌人那种胆怯狼狈的样子，浑身的力气好像往外冒，那肯放松，乘着团团硝烟，脚跟脚地追了下去。自己的手雷扔完了，就拣起敌人扔下的手榴弹，一个紧接一个向敌人扔去。敌人向左面涌过去，左面是悬崖，有的失脚摔了下去；敌人又向右面涌了过去，右面我八号阵地上的机枪也叫起来了；当我军的炮兵观察员发现敌人乱成了一锅粥的时候，炮兵马上开炮拦阻敌人的退路。就这样，妄想夺取二号阵地的一个加强连的敌人，大部分被埋葬在英雄的二号阵地前沿了。
    傍晚，霞光映着硝烟，不屈的五九七点九高地傲然屹立着。跟敌人连续鏖战了四昼夜，消灭敌人一百四十多名的青年战士林炳远身上沾满了泥土，眼睛布满了血丝，脸上被硝烟薰得黧黑，但他的精神却一点也不显得疲倦。
    晚上，当兄弟部队增援上来时，林炳远才奉命离开了阵地。
    三
    不久以前，这位中国人民志愿军的特等功臣、二级战斗英雄和一批青年战友们一起，从朝鲜前线来到了北京，出席最近在北京举行的中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会。六月二十六日，当这位青年英雄出现在大会的主席台上，向参加大会的同志们报告他的英雄事迹的时候，台下响起了一阵暴风雨般的掌声。人们以无限喜悦和崇敬的目光，来欢迎这位保卫和平、保卫祖国的战士。青年英雄林炳远胸前的一枚“一级战士荣誉勋章”闪耀着青春的光辉，这是胜利的光辉，是英雄的上甘岭阵地上永世不灭的光辉。
