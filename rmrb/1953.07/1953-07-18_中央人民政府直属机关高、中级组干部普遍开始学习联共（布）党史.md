    Central People's Government Directly Subordinate Organs' High and Middle-Level Cadres Generally Begin Studying the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)
    [This Newspaper News] The high and middle-level study group cadres of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government began studying "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in early July. Before the start of the study, the Party Committee of the Central People's Government successively convened two meetings of full-time Party committee secretaries and Party committee office directors of subordinate units to arrange the preparatory work before the study and to check on the implementation situation. In addition to deciding to spend one month studying the first eight chapters of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," each unit also adopted necessary measures for lecturing, class assignments, etc. For example, eighteen units, including the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, began class assignments and lecturing for the middle-level groups in late June. The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Culture, and other units have also decided to invite specialists to explain the first eight chapters of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" to cadres.
    In May and June, the Party Committee of the Central People's Government focused on the following three tasks: First, running training classes for theoretical instructors and tutors. According to the planned schedule, the training class will conclude on July 18. The serious problem currently existing in this work is that the trainees generally show timidity about lecturing in their respective organs after graduation, fearing that they will not be able to do it well; the general cadres of each organ also have excessively high expectations of theoretical instructors and tutors. Therefore, the Party organizations of the organs must vigorously assist the theoretical instructors and tutors in their teaching work, regarding them as powerful assistants under the leadership of the Party committee to guide the theoretical study of the organ's cadres, and should encourage them to lecture boldly and strive to do a good job in teaching; the general cadres should be persuaded and explained that the requirements for theoretical instructors should not be too high, as they are only one step ahead of everyone in learning.
    Second, formulating a unified study plan. The study guidelines stipulated in the study plan are: 1. We should study the theories and experiences of economic construction from the perspective of the historical development of the Soviet Union; 2. We should proceed from the overall viewpoint and focus on key points in our study; 3. We should integrate theory with practice, inserting the study of relevant documents on China's economic construction and the Party's instructions in each chapter. Regarding the pace of study, the plan stipulates: spend one month in July to browse the first eight chapters of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)"; from August to November, spend four months to study Chapter 9 and related documents; from December to the end of April 1954, spend five months to study Chapter 10 and related documents; from May 1954 to the end of September, spend five months to study Chapter 11 and related documents; from October 1954 to the end of the year, spend three months to study Chapter 12 and related documents.
    Third, regarding the issue of class assignments for study. Currently, a common problem in class assignments is the inappropriate upgrading of some cadres' class assignments. According to preliminary statistics from twenty units, including the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government, among 16,984 people, 758 are in the advanced group, accounting for 4.4% of the total number; 13,103 are in the intermediate group, accounting for 77.2% of the total number; and only 3,123 are in the elementary group, accounting for 18.3% of the total number. It is understood that some of the people in the above statistics should have been assigned to the elementary group, but were inappropriately assigned to the intermediate group. In order to solve this problem in class assignments, the Party Committee of the Central People's Government, in addition to actively preparing to formulate a study plan for the elementary group to study "Elementary Knowledge of Economics" and urging each unit to quickly find theoretical instructors for the elementary group, also requires the leaders of each unit to mobilize everyone to adopt a realistic attitude in class assignments, opposing the idea of aiming too high, so as not to affect the effectiveness of the study. Some units, such as Xinhua News Agency, have adopted the method of testing to carry out class assignments.

### 中央人民政府直属机关高、中级组干部普遍开始学习联共（布）党史

    中央人民政府直属机关高、中级组干部普遍开始学习联共（布）党史
    【本报讯】中央人民政府直属机关高、中级学习组干部，七月初已普遍开始学习“联共（布）党史”。在开始学习之前，中共中央人民政府党委曾先后召开了两次所属各单位专职党委书记、党委办公室主任会议，布置学习前的准备工作，并检查执行的情况。各单位除决定先以一个月的时间进行“联共（布）党史”前八章的学习外，还对讲课、编级等采取了必要的措施。如中央人民政府财政经济委员会等十八个单位，在六月下旬就开始进行中级组的编级和讲课。中央建筑工程部、文化部等单位也都决定请专人给干部讲解“联共（布）党史”前八章。
    在五、六两月份中，中共中央人民政府党委曾着重抓紧了以下三件工作：第一、开办理论教员、辅导员训练班。按照预定计划，训练班将在七月十八日结业。这一工作目前存在的严重问题，是训练班的学员对毕业后回机关讲课，普遍表现胆怯，怕讲不了；各机关一般干部也有对理论教员、辅导员要求过高的情绪。因此，机关党的组织，必须大力协助理论教员、辅导员进行教学工作，把他们看成是在党委领导下，指导机关干部进行理论学习的有力助手，并应鼓励他们大胆讲课，努力做好教学工作；对一般干部则应进行说服解释，必须说明对理论教员的要求不能过高，他们仅仅是比大家先学一步。
    第二、拟定统一的学习计划。学习计划中规定的学习方针是：一、应当从苏联历史发展过程中研究经济建设的理论与经验；二、应当从全局的观点出发，有重点地进行学习；三、理论联系实际，在每章的学习中分别插入一些有关我国经济建设的文献和党的指示的学习。关于学习进度，计划中规定：以七月份一个月的时间，浏览“联共（布）党史”前八章；自八月份起至十一月份，以四个月的时间，学完第九章及有关文件；自十二月份起至一九五四年四月底，以五个月的时间，学完第十章及有关文件；自一九五四年五月份起至九月底，以五个月的时间，学完第十一章及有关文件；自一九五四年十月份起至年底，以三个月的时间，学完第十二章及有关文件。
    第三、关于学习编级问题。目前在编级中普遍存在的一个问题是不适当地把一些干部的编级提高了。根据中央第二机械工业部等二十个单位的初步统计，在一万六千九百八十四人中，高级组七百五十八人，占上述总人数百分之四点四；中级组一万三千一百零三人，占总数百分之七十七点二；初级组仅有三千一百二十三人，占总数百分之十八点三。据了解：上述统计中有一部分人本来应当编入初级组的，结果却不适当地编到中级组去了。为了解决编级中的这个问题，中共中央人民政府党委除一面积极准备拟定初级组学习“经济常识读本”的学习计划与督促各单位迅速物色初级组理论教员等工作外，一面要求各单位的领导进行动员，号召大家在学习编级上采取实事求是的态度，反对好高骛远的思想，以免影响学习的效果。有些单位，例如新华通讯社，已采用测验的办法来进行编级。
