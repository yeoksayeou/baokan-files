Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 6th: Imre Nagy, the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, reported the government's program to the National Assembly on the 4th.

In his report, Nagy focused on Hungary's achievements in laying the foundations for socialism and developing the national economy, pointed out the assistance given to the Hungarian people by the Soviet Union, and discussed economic policy issues. He emphasized that the government will continue to implement economic policies based on practical goals and the guiding principles of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

Nagy said, "We should see, and frankly tell the people of the whole country, that the goals of the expanded Five-Year Plan, in many respects, exceed the scope that our strength can reach. We must advance towards socialism along the path of people's democracy, along the path of socialist industrialization; while implementing socialist industrialization, we must strive to continuously improve the living standards of the working people, and better meet the social and cultural needs of the working people, especially the needs of the working class, the main force of socialist construction. The government will revise the national economic plan in terms of both production and investment, and will submit a draft to make corresponding reductions to the overall plan. We have no reason to implement excessive industrialization, no reason to pursue industrial self-sufficiency; especially when there are no necessary raw material reserves, we should not do so."

Speaking of agricultural issues, Nagy said that the government believes that greatly increasing agricultural investment in order to develop agriculture as quickly and comprehensively as possible is one of the government's main tasks. Guaranteeing that the principle of voluntary participation of farmers in agricultural production cooperatives is observed is the government's primary task. At the same time, the government will vigorously help and support the development of cooperatives, because the government believes that this is the most reliable way to develop agriculture.

Nagy then pointed out that the economic policies regarding private enterprises in retail trade and small-scale industry must be changed.

Nagy reiterated the basic principle of the government's economic policy, which is to ensure the continuous improvement of the people's living standards. He pointed out that the government has resolved to reduce the high cost of living. He said that after a bumper harvest is obtained and the industrial production plan is fully realized, it will be possible to reduce the prices of certain grains and manufactured goods that are still high. He went on to say that the government is determined to ensure the implementation of labor laws, and if anyone misappropriates funds for the health care of the working people, they will be severely punished by the government; the government will also make large investments to vigorously improve public utilities in urban and rural areas, and will also allocate large amounts of funds for the construction and repair of housing.

Nagy said, "The issues I have talked about above clearly show the path of economic development that the government wants to follow together with the people of the whole country—the path to the goal of socialism; initially, we may walk slower, but we are advancing with full confidence."

Speaking of the recent international situation, especially the fascist provocations in Berlin, Nagy pointed out that in the struggle for peace, the Hungarian people's guide to action is to unite with the peace-loving people of all countries, and to have sincere friendship with the vanguard of the world peace movement—the great Soviet Union. The basic principle of the foreign policy of the Hungarian People's Government is to strive for peace and economic cooperation between countries based on the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries.

Nagy finally said: "I am deeply convinced that the working people of our country—the working class, the peasants, and the intellectuals—who have a deep sense of responsibility for the motherland, will carry out the tasks we have set and achieve the goals we have set. I am deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, based on its suggestions and closely united with the people, we will move forward with greater confidence than before along the road to the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of the people, to a bright future and socialism."

    匈牙利新任部长会议主席纳吉
    在国民议会中报告政府施政纲领
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯六日讯：匈牙利人民共和国新任部长会议主席伊姆雷·纳吉，四日在国民议会中报告了政府的施政纲领。
    纳吉在报告中着重地叙述了匈牙利在奠定社会主义基础和发展国民经济方面所取得的成就，指出了苏联给与匈牙利人民的帮助，并谈到了经济政策问题。他强调：政府将继续执行以切实的目标和匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的指导原则为基础的经济政策。
    纳吉说，我们应该看到，并且坦白地告诉全国人民，扩大了的五年计划的目标，在许多方面是超出了我们的力量所能达到的范围的。我们必须沿着人民民主的道路，沿着社会主义工业化的道路，向社会主义前进；而在实行社会主义工业化的同时，必须设法不断提高劳动人民的生活水平，更好地满足劳动人民的社会和文化需要，首先是社会主义建设的主力——工人阶级的需要。政府将在生产和投资两方面修改国民经济计划，并将提出一个草案，以便把总的计划作相应的紧缩。我们没有理由实行过分的工业化，没有理由追求工业上的自给自足；在没有必要的原料贮备的情况下，尤其不应该这样做。
    纳吉在谈到农业问题的时候说，政府认为，大大增加农业投资以便尽可能迅速地、全面地发展农业，是政府的主要任务之一。保证农民加入农业生产合作社的自愿原则得到遵守，是政府的首要任务。同时，政府将大力帮助并支持合作社的发展，因为政府相信，这是发展农业的最可靠的办法。
    纳吉接着指出，关于零售贸易和小规模工业中的私人企业的经济政策必须加以变更。
    纳吉再度强调政府经济政策的基本原则，就是保证人民生活水平的不断提高。他指出，政府已经下定决心降低高昂的生活费用。他说，在获得了丰收和全部实现了工业生产计划后，就有可能减低目前仍然高的某些粮食和制成品的价格。他接着说，政府决心保证实行劳动法，如果有人挪用劳动人民保健的拨款，将受到政府的严惩；政府并将以大量投资，大力改进城乡的公用事业，还要拨出大笔经费作建筑和修缮住宅之用。
    纳吉说，上面我所谈到的问题，清楚地表明了政府要和全国人民一道遵循的发展经济的道路——走向社会主义目标的道路；最初，我们也许走得慢些，但是我们是满怀信心地前进的。
    在谈到最近的国际局势，尤其是柏林的法西斯挑衅行动时，纳吉指出，在争取和平的斗争中，匈牙利人民的行动指南，就是和各国爱好和平的人民团结一致，以及对世界和平运动的先锋——伟大的苏联——的真挚友谊。匈牙利人民政府的外交政策的基本原则，就是根据各国和平共处的可能性争取和平和各国间的经济合作。
    纳吉最后说：我深信，对祖国抱着深切责任感的我国劳动人民——工人阶级，农民和知识分子，会执行我们规定的任务，达到我们规定的目标。我深信，在匈牙利劳动人民党的领导下，根据它的建议并和人民紧密地团结在一起，我们将怀着比以前更大的信心，沿着通往祖国繁荣和人民幸福、通往光辉未来和社会主义的道路前进。
