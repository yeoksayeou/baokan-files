Xinhua News Agency, July 12th:

    Responding to the call from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sohyo") to oppose the anti-strike law, three million Japanese workers launched strikes and other forms of struggle again on the 11th, resolutely opposing the fascist anti-strike law.
    With the assistance of the Kaishinto Party, Yoshida's Liberal Party forcibly passed the anti-strike law in the House of Representatives on the 11th and immediately sent it to the House of Councillors for discussion. This bill deprives workers in Japan's major industrial sectors, primarily electricity and coal mine workers, of the right to strike. Prior to this, Yoshida's Minister of Justice, Ken Inukai, and Minister of Labor, Zentaro Kosaka, had successively issued threatening statements, warning workers not to strike in opposition to the anti-strike law.
    Despite this, the ongoing Fourth National Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sohyo") passed a resolution on the 10th, calling on three million workers from the thirty-seven unions affiliated with "Sohyo" to hold a second strike on the 11th to protest the anti-strike law. "Sohyo" pointed out that this bill is a direct threat to the Japanese labor movement. "Sohyo" also accused the Yoshida Cabinet of attempting to forcibly pass this measure as a preparatory step to accepting "aid" from the US "Mutual Security Agency."
    On the 11th, the second large-scale demonstration of the Japanese working class against the anti-strike law officially broke out. Two hundred forty-five thousand coal miners held a twenty-four-hour strike. The Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union implemented power outages in large factories. Workers in important industrial sectors such as metal mines, shipbuilding, chemical industry, steel, and automobile industry also held strikes. Many other employees protested the anti-strike law by holding meetings and refusing to work overtime.
    On the 11th, "Sohyo" once again announced that it would continue to fight against the unconstitutional anti-strike law by holding strikes in important industrial sectors.

    响应“总评”反对禁止罢工法的号召
    日本三百万工人再度展开大规模斗争
    【新华社十二日讯】继四日的大规模抗议运动之后，日本三百万工人在十一日再度举行罢工和其他方式的斗争，坚决反对法西斯的禁止罢工法。
    吉田自由党在改进党的协助之下，十一日在国会众议院强制通过了禁止罢工法，并立即送交参议院讨论。这个法案剥夺了日本主要工业部门、首先是电力和煤矿工人的罢工权利。在此以前，吉田政府法务相犬养健和劳动相小坂善太郎曾先后发表威胁性的谈话，警告工人不得举行罢工来反对禁止罢工法。
    尽管如此，正在举行中的日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）第四次全国大会，在十日通过决议，号召属于“总评”的三十七个工会的三百万工人，在十一日举行第二次罢工抗议禁止罢工法。“总评”指出，这个法案是对日本劳工运动的直接威胁。“总评”并指责吉田内阁正在企图强行通过这个措施，作为接受美国“共同安全署”“援助”的预备步骤。
    十一日，日本工人阶级第二次大规模抗议禁止罢工法的示威正式爆发。二十四万五千名煤矿工人举行了二十四小时的罢工。日本电气产业工会对大工厂实行停电。金属矿山、造船、化学工业、钢铁、汽车工业等重要产业部门的工人，也纷纷举行罢工。其他许多职工以集会、拒绝逾时工作等方式，抗议禁止罢工法。
    “总评”在十一日再度宣布，它将采取在重要产业部门举行罢工的方式，继续为反对违反宪法的禁止罢工法而斗争。
