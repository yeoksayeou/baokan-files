    Design Work of Shandong Construction Engineering Bureau Nears Completion
    The design work for new projects in Shandong Province this year is nearing completion.

    The total area of new construction projects in Shandong Province this year is estimated to be over 500,000 square meters, requiring design for over 64,000 square meters. Considering the weak design capabilities of the Shandong Construction Engineering Bureau, the East China Architectural Design Company dispatched some design personnel to provide support. All design personnel recognized the importance of this task and developed detailed design plans based on the assignments, actively engaging in this work in early May and early June. In their work, they demonstrated initiative and creativity, devising many methods to overcome difficulties. Of decisive significance was the adoption of simultaneous architectural and structural design. In the past, general engineering design was carried out in two steps, first architectural design, and then structural design based on the architectural design. This took a long time, making it difficult to ensure timely construction. After joint research by the design personnel, the method of simultaneous architectural and structural design was adopted, ensuring quality and accuracy while improving efficiency by more than twofold. At the same time, in order to save time, advanced Soviet standard designs were adopted in several aspects, such as unified door and window specifications. Due to the efforts of the design staff in various aspects, the design efficiency of the Shandong Construction Engineering Bureau rapidly increased nearly threefold, with the quota per person per hour increasing from 2.5 square meters to 9.55 square meters. The design work is therefore rapidly nearing completion.

    In the design process, the design personnel also established the idea of economic accounting and actively learned from advanced Soviet experience, such as the use of pre-fabricated hollow concrete floor slabs and pre-fabricated hollow concrete beams. This not only saves 20 to 30 percent of materials but also accelerates construction.

    Currently, the Shandong Construction Engineering Company, Qingdao Construction Engineering Company, Xuzhou Construction Company, and other units undertaking the above construction tasks are actively carrying out construction preparations, striving for timely construction.

    山东建筑工程局设计工作接近完成
    山东省今年新工程的设计工作已接近完成。
    山东省今年新工程任务约计在五十万平方公尺以上，需要设计的面积达六万四千多平方公尺，华东建筑设计公司鉴于山东省建筑工程局设计力量薄弱，曾抽调部分设计人员前往支援。全体设计人员认识到这一任务的重要性，根据任务制订了详细的设计计划，先后在五月上旬和六月上旬积极投入了这一工作。他们在工作中，发挥了积极性和创造性，想出很多办法来克服困难。其中有决定意义的是采用建筑设计和结构设计同时进行的办法。过去一般工程设计，分两个步骤进行，即首先进行建筑设计，然后根据建筑设计，进行结构设计。这样，所需时间很长，要争取及时施工就有很多困难。经设计人员共同研究，在保证质量和准确性的原则下，采取了建筑设计和结构设计同时进行的办法，提高效率一倍以上。同时，为了节省时间，并在若干方面采取了苏联的先进标准设计，如统一门窗规格等。由于设计工作人员在各方面的努力，山东省建筑工程局的设计效率迅速提高了近三倍，每人每小时定额由二点五平方公尺提高到九点五五平方公尺。设计工作因而迅速接近完成。
    在设计中，设计人员并树立了经济核算的思想，积极学习苏联的先进经验，如采用预制空心混凝土楼板、预制空心混凝土梁等经验，这样不但可以节省百分之二十到三十的材料，并且可以加速施工。
    现在，承建上述施工任务的山东建筑工程公司、青岛建筑工程公司、徐州建筑公司等单位，正积极进行施工准备工作，争取及时施工。
