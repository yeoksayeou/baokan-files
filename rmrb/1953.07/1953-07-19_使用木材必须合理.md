    Rational Use of Timber is Essential
    Timber is an important resource in national economic construction and people's lives. With the development of China's planned construction undertakings and the increasing improvement of people's living standards, the demand for timber is increasing unprecedentedly. In the past three years, the national timber felling volume has increased rapidly and will continue to increase in the future. However, on the other hand, China's forest resources are limited, and the timber production is far from meeting the country's long-term needs. These forests are mostly scattered in remote border areas, and the distribution areas of various tree species are extremely vast. Even if some good timber can be felled, it is not easy to transport it out of the forest area. To solve the problem of timber shortage, in addition to the forestry departments carrying out planned felling and rational timber production in the forests, the most important thing is for the timber-using departments to seriously save timber and use timber rationally. The State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions on saving timber in August 1951 stated: "All engineering constructions should strictly reduce the amount of timber required to the lowest standard: those not urgently needed should be used slowly or less; those that can be replaced by other materials such as bamboo, cement, bricks, and stones should not be used or used less." These instructions should become our long-term principles for using timber.
    Since the promulgation of the State Council's instructions on saving timber, some departments have begun to pay attention to saving timber and using timber rationally. The pit prop recovery implemented by the Beipiao Mining Bureau, the wooden board scheduling implemented by the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, the use of live board boxes instead of dead board boxes for packaging products implemented by the Fushun Mining Bureau, the use of bamboo materials instead of wooden boards for packaging goods by some enterprises, and the conversion of wooden floors to cement floors by some construction departments are all very good. However, it should be pointed out that the phenomenon of wasting timber and using timber irrationally still exists seriously and universally in many units. Many timber-using departments demand good timber from the state; and put forward many unrealistic requirements, such as requiring the timber to be "without knots," "without blemishes," and "without cracks." They do not base it on their own construction needs, but want good red pine for all purposes, and the thicker and longer the better. Even the wooden strips plastered inside the lime wall must be made of red pine, garbage bins must be made of red pine, and pickle buckets must be made of first-class red pine. This leads to a large waste of the country's limited good timber. There are also many departments that do not make plans when using timber, blindly demanding allocation, "rather more than less"; some allocation departments also blindly allocate to them without review. As a result, some departments receive too much, resulting in a large amount of surplus and waste of timber; but many important construction sites that need good materials cannot receive them in time. At the same time, the phenomenon of using good materials for inferior purposes, using long materials for short purposes, and using large materials for small purposes is also very common. Some construction sites' own timber mills, for their own convenience, do not receive short materials, but cut the long materials they receive into shorter pieces; do not want small materials, but receive large and extra-large materials and then cut them into smaller pieces; do not want inferior materials, but receive good materials and then saw them badly and let them rot. As for hardwood and miscellaneous wood, they are not used at all or rarely used.
    The reasons for the waste of timber and the irrational use of timber are that these people lack an overall concept and have serious departmentalism. They do not adopt the method of saving, saving, and saving again for things that the country is very short of, but try every means to demand and receive more. Secondly, they have not done a good job in studying the coordination of design, construction and material supply, or they only pay attention to design and construction and ignore the supply of materials. They do not understand what kind of timber should be used in what place, and therefore do not question the illegal and disciplinary behavior of material receiving personnel and timber using personnel; at the same time, the chaotic management of many construction sites and the lack of unified scheduling of material use are also a cause of waste.
    Due to the irrational use of timber, another phenomenon has also emerged. That is, on the one hand, everyone feels that timber is not enough and not good, but on the other hand, a large amount of timber is stored in many timber yards and timber mills. The reason is that this batch of timber is mostly considered "unqualified" or "not fully qualified." The forestry department is also "clueless" about this batch of timber, and at the same time has not thought of more ways to solve these problems. Allocation personnel do not understand the timber production situation, nor do they understand the timber demand situation, and only blindly respond to the requirements of the material receiving personnel. In this way, both funds are tied up and timber is wasted.
    The phenomenon of wasting timber and using timber irrationally must be stopped. The State Council's instructions on saving timber and using timber rationally must be adhered to. The method is to educate all employees in the timber-using departments, so that they know that China's timber is seriously insufficient; and that timber cannot be dispensed with in the further development of national economic construction and our future rich lives, so as to establish an overall concept of cherishing and saving the country's timber resources. In order to overcome the phenomenon of wasting timber and using timber irrationally, the forestry department should implement the principle of timber production near the mountains, process timber locally, and widely sign contracts with timber-using departments to overcome the blindness of processing and strive to implement planned production, so as to ensure that the processed timber can be allocated externally in a timely manner. Construction engineering departments should further formulate the specifications and saving methods for using timber in engineering. It must be strictly stipulated what to build and manufacture, what timber to use, and how much timber to use. Strict constraints should be placed on those who waste state property and those who engage in departmentalism in the use of timber.

### 使用木材必须合理

    使用木材必须合理
    木材是国家经济建设和人民生活中的一种重要资料。随着我国有计划的建设事业的开展和人民生活水平的日益提高，对木材的需要正空前的增加，最近三年来，全国木材采伐量迅速增加，今后还会继续增加。但是，问题的另一方面，却是我国的森林资源有限，木材的产量和国家长期的需要量相距甚远。这些森林又多散布在偏僻的边陲地带，各种树种分布的地区也极其广阔，即令能采伐一些很好的木材，也不易从林区搬运出来。要解决木材不足的问题，除林业部门应在森林里进行有计划的采伐和合理造材以外，最主要的还是使用木材的部门要认真节约木材和合理使用木材。一九五一年八月中央人民政府政务院关于节约木材的指示中说：“一切工程建筑，应将需用木材数量，切实核减至最低标准：非迫切需要的，应缓用或少用；可以其他材料如竹头、水泥、砖、石等代替的，应不用或减用”。这些指示，应该长期地成为我们使用木材的原则。
    政务院节约木材的指示颁布以来，有些部门已开始注意节约木材和合理使用木材。北票矿务局所实行的坑木收回，鞍山钢铁厂所实行的木板调度，抚顺矿务局所实行的以活板箱代替死板箱包装产品，还有一些企业单位用竹料代替木板包装商品，有的建筑部门把木板地改为水泥地等，都是很好的。但是应该指出，浪费木材和使用木材不合理的现象，在很多单位仍然严重而普遍地存在着。很多使用木材的部门，向国家要木材时都要好木材；并且提出许多脱离实际的要求，如要求木材“无疤”、“无节”、“不裂”等。他们不是根据自己建筑上的需要，而是不管什么用途都要好红松，并且是越粗越长越好。以至被抹在石灰墙里面的木条子也要用红松，做垃圾箱子也要用红松；做酱菜桶也用一等红松。这就使国家有限的好木材被大量浪费了。还有很多部门，在使用木材时不作计划，盲目地要求调拨，“宁多勿少”；有的调拨部门也就不加审核地盲目地给他们调拨。结果使有些部门多领了，造成木材的大量剩余和浪费；但很多需要好材的重要工地，却不能及时地领到。同时，优材劣用，长材短用和大材小用，也是很普遍的现象。某些建筑工地自设的制材厂，为了自己的方便，不领短材，而把领来的长材再锯短；不要小材，而把大材、特大材领来再锯小；不要次材，而把好材领来再锯坏和放坏。至于硬木、杂木，却根本不被利用或很少利用。
    产生浪费木材和使用木材不合理的原因，是这些人们缺乏整体观念，存在着严重的本位主义。他们对国家非常缺少的东西，不是采取节约、节约再节约的办法，而是想尽一切办法多要和多领。其次，他们没有很好地研究设计、施工和材料供应的配合，或者只注意设计、施工而忽略了材料的供应。他们不懂得什么地方应该用什么木材，因而也不过问领材人员和使用木材的人员违犯法纪的行为；同时，由于很多施工现场管理混乱，缺乏材料使用的统一调度，也是造成浪费的一种原因。
    由于木材使用的不合理，也产生了另外一种现象。这就是一方面大家都感到木材不够、不好，而另一方面在很多储木场里和制材厂里却储放着大批的木材。原因就是这批木材，多被认为“不合格”或“不完全合格”。林业部门对这批木材也“心中无数”，同时也没想出更多的办法去解决这些问题。调配人员不了解木材生产情况，也不了解需材情况，只是盲目应付领材人员的要求。这样，既积压了资金，也浪费了木材。
    浪费木材和不合理使用木材的现象必须停止。政务院指示的节约木材和合理使用木材的原则必须坚持。办法是要在一切使用木材部门的职工中进行教育，使他们知道我国木材的严重不足；而在国家经济建设进一步开展和我们未来的丰富的生活里，又不能缺少木材，从而建立起爱护和节约国家木材资源的整体观念。为了克服浪费木材和使用木材不合理的现象，林业部门应该实行靠山制材的原则，就地进行木材加工，并广泛地与使用木材的部门订立合同，克服加工的盲目性，努力实行计划生产，以保证加工后的木材能够及时向外调拨。建筑工程部门应进一步拟制工程上使用木材的规格和节约的办法。必须严格规定建筑和制造什么东西，用什么木材，用多少木材。给那些浪费国家财产的人，给那些使用木材上的本位主义者以严格的约束。
