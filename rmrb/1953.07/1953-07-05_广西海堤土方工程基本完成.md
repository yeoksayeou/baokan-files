Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 4th: The earthwork for the seawall project in the Qinzhou Special District of Guangxi Province has been basically completed, and stone revetment and culvert gate construction are now underway. After the completion of the seawall project, it will not only be able to withstand high tides and protect more than 66,000 mu of paddy fields, but also expand the cultivated area and transform many tidal fields that can only yield one crop a year into freshwater fields that can yield two crops a year.

The Qinzhou Special District is the region in China's South Sea coastal areas with the highest frequency of typhoon intrusion. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, many areas' seawalls were only equal to or even lower than the highest historical tide levels. In addition, the dikes were thin and had been in disrepair for many years. The great tides in May and October of the lunar calendar caused great damage to the lives and property of coastal residents every year. In order to ensure the safety of more than 100,000 farmers and fishermen along the coast, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government sent a survey team to conduct on-site surveys in 1951 and invested in key repairs to the old dikes. Last year, the tide level was the highest seen in 36 years, but the danger period was basically completely overcome. This year, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government invested another 3.5 billion yuan and started construction of the seawall in April, including repairing old dikes, building new dikes, stone revetment, and building culvert gates. Thanks to the active repair work of the laborers, the earthwork of the seawall project was basically completed in mid-June.

### 广西海堤土方工程基本完成

    广西海堤土方工程基本完成
    【新华社南宁四日电】广西省钦州专区海堤工程土方已基本完工，现正砌石护坡和修涵闸。海堤工程完工后，不仅可挡住大潮，保护六万六千多亩水田，并能扩大耕地面积，把很多每年只能收一季的潮水田变成收两季的淡水田。
    钦州专区是我国沿南海各地台风侵入频率最大的地区。但在国民党反动统治时代，由于当地很多地区的海堤只相等甚至低于历年最高潮水位，加之堤身单薄，年久失修，每年农历五月和十月大潮侵袭，危害沿海居民的生命财产甚大。为了保障沿海十多万农民和渔民的安全，广西省人民政府在一九五一年派测量队去实地勘测，投资重点培修旧堤。去年七月，海潮水位高度为三十六年来所未见，但仍基本上完全度过了险期。今年广西省人民政府又投资三十五亿元，在四月间开工修建海堤，包括培修旧堤、并筑新堤、砌石护坡、修涵闸等。由于民工们积极抢修，六月中旬已基本完成了海堤土方工程。
