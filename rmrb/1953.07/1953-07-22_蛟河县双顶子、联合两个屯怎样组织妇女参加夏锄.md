How Shuangdingzi and Lianhe Villages in Jiaohe County Organize Women to Participate in Summer Weeding
    Song Lin, En Gui, Zhi Qiang, Zhao Cai, Lin Kun
    Since June 9th, 53 of the 82 women in Shuangdingzi and Lianhe villages in the 15th District of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province (twice as many as last year) have participated in work such as thinning seedlings and accumulating manure. The Zou Fenglou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangdingzi has had over 20 women participating in thinning seedlings every day from June 9th to June 17th. The cooperative's 13 hectares of soybeans, which were widely sown, were all thinned in nine days, and met the quality standards. In Lianhe Village, the Gao Daichang mutual aid team even had four women with children actively participating in thinning seedlings. The four female members of the Han Kui mutual aid team took the initiative to participate in thinning soybeans in the Gao Daichang team when their own team's crops were not yet growing well, in order to learn the thinning techniques. They not only learned the thinning techniques, but also received wages. They happily said: "Earlier, we heard the cadres say that when thinning soybeans, you have to leave 'crutch seedlings' and 'chicken claw shapes,' and we were unsure how to start. After learning in the field in Gao Daichang team, we realized that thinning seedlings is not difficult. We will also thin our team's crops when we return to our team." Due to the active participation of women in summer weeding, the hoeing and thinning work in the two villages has progressed rapidly. Because of the participation of women in thinning work, the Gao Daichang team freed up 24 male laborers to specialize in hoeing. The team has already hoed the first time and is currently hoeing the second time. Team leader Gao Daichang said with satisfaction: "When the seedlings first emerged, I saw that the rows were so wide, how could we thin them? If women hadn't participated in production, we would have been overwhelmed with work." In order to do a good job in topdressing, the women in the two villages, in addition to actively participating in thinning seedlings, also actively prepared manure. Wang Shuyun and 15 other members of the Zou Fenglou Agricultural Production Cooperative alone accumulated 2,500 kilograms of small ash, 2,000 kilograms of chicken and duck manure, and other manure.
    The reason why women in these two villages can actively and extensively participate in summer weeding is mainly because the local village cadres solved the following problems when organizing and mobilizing women to participate in production:
    1. Reasonably calculate labor remuneration and implement the principle of equal pay for equal work. Last year, there were biases in the organization of women's participation in production in these two villages. Although women did the same work, they did not receive the same pay. Last year, women in the Zou Fengshan team only earned half a work point for weeding seedlings or hoeing for a day, and at most seven work points. However, when they weeded, the men couldn't keep up, which affected women's enthusiasm for participating in production. In order to enable women to actively participate in production, this year both villages have corrected the previous biases. Most mutual aid teams have formulated standard work points for the work that women can do (such as thinning seedlings) and contracted it to women. For example, the Gao Daichang team set 15 work points for thinning one hectare of soybeans, and the women distributed the money according to the rows. In order to ensure that the standard work points are accurate and that neither party suffers losses, each team and cooperative conducts experiments before thinning each crop. For example, the Zou Fenglou Cooperative originally stipulated 15 work points for thinning one hectare of soybeans, but because the land was barren and difficult to thin, 15 work points were not enough and 20 work points were needed. The cooperative leaders promptly changed it to 20 work points, which encouraged women's enthusiasm for participating in labor. Female cooperative members Wang Shuyun and Ju Zhongqiu earned ten work points every day when thinning soybeans, which was more than some male cooperative members earned.
    2. Solve the specific difficulties of women participating in production in many ways. Although the implementation of equal pay for equal work has stimulated women's enthusiasm for participating in production, women still cannot participate in production if they cannot solve the specific difficulties of women participating in production well. The biggest difficulty for women participating in production is having children. They asked: "If we have to work, cook, feed pigs and chickens, and breastfeed our children, how can we have time to work in the fields?" In order to solve this problem, the two villages organized eight elderly women to take care of the children when organizing women to participate in production, and mobilized women to use their relationships with relatives and mothers-in-law to take care of 14 children, allowing 11 women with children to free themselves up to participate in production. Each team and cooperative assigned women with breastfeeding children to work in places close to the village, so that women with breastfeeding children could breastfeed on time, eliminating their concerns about starving their children and allowing them to participate in production with peace of mind. The Zhang Lianbi mutual aid team, in order to take care of the few women in the family who feed pigs and chickens and do cooking and other odd jobs, allowed them to go home half an hour early at noon and in the evening. In order to take care of women's physical strength and health, each team stipulated that women should not go to the fields in the morning, should rest for an hour at noon, and should have longer breaks and time to go home to breastfeed their children. Therefore, women all reflected: This year's summer weeding is really a win-win situation for both people and wealth, and the more we work, the more energetic we become.
    3. Cultivate typical examples, set up role models, and promote the participation of the majority of women in production. In order to enable some women who are unwilling to participate in production to participate in production, the two villages found five female backbones, such as Wang Shuyun, Tang Fengzhen, and Ju Zhongqiu, who have prestige among the masses and can often participate in labor, as examples. When five women in the Gao Daichang mutual aid team participated in work for the first time, some of them were so tired that their backs and legs ached when they returned home in the evening because they were not used to it, and their emotions were a little low. Tang Fengzhen, the female production team leader of the team, encouraged them and said: "We will be a little tired on the first day of work, but we must persevere, and our bodies will become stronger. The female comrades in the Volunteer Army are fighting in Korea just like the male comrades. If we bow our heads after suffering a little bit of hardship in the rear, how can we fight for equality between men and women?" After her encouragement, they persisted in going to work in the fields the next day. They said: "Tang Fengzhen and Wang Shuyun can do it, and we can't fall behind!"
    4. In the process of production, teach women to learn production techniques. Although women have high enthusiasm for participating in production, they have a very poor grasp of agricultural techniques. Some members of mutual aid teams are unwilling to let women thin their own crops because they are afraid that women will not thin the seedlings well. In order to solve this problem, cadres organized women to learn thinning techniques before thinning seedlings. At the beginning of thinning seedlings, each team first had the thinning experts in the team set an example and teach women who did not know how to thin seedlings to learn. When the Gao Daichang team first started thinning seedlings, Tang Fengzhen, who had learned thinning techniques in the county, first thinned out a sample in the soybean field, thinning it into double seedling eyes, leaving one seedling every three or four inches apart. After the women learned the thinning techniques, their enthusiasm for participating in thinning seedlings also increased. The members of each mutual aid team were also relieved to let women thin their seedlings. In order to continuously improve and improve the production skills of women, the technical extension workers in each mutual aid team went deep into the fields to provide technical guidance. The technical extension worker of the Zou Fenglou Cooperative found that some female cooperative members were not thinning soybeans according to technical requirements in the field, and promptly told her to correct it.
    When a woman is found to have shortcomings in production, do not shout and yell, but patiently teach her how to correct them, and increase her confidence in learning agricultural techniques. When the Zou Fenglou Cooperative was thinning seedlings, some female cooperative members did not clean up some of the weeds when thinning seedlings because they had just learned to thin seedlings. After the cooperative leaders discovered this phenomenon, they individually told them to correct it.

    蛟河县双顶子、联合两个屯怎样组织妇女参加夏锄
    松林　恩贵　志强　兆才　林坤
    吉林省蛟河县第十五区双顶子、联合两个屯的八十二名妇女，从六月九日起，已有五十三名（比去年增加了二倍）参加了间苗、攒粪等工作。双顶子邹凤楼农业生产合作社，从六月九日到六月十七日，每天都有二十余名妇女参加间苗。该社宽播的十三垧大豆，九天工夫就全部间完了，并且合乎质量要求标准。联合屯高岱长互助组连有小孩的四名妇女也积极参加间苗；韩奎互助组的四名女组员在本组的庄稼苗还长得不大的时候，为了学会间苗技术，就主动地到高岱长组参加间大豆，她们不但学会了间苗技术，还得到了工资。她们高兴地说：早先听干部讲间大豆得留拐子苗、鸡爪形，我们心中就没底了，不知怎么下手好，这回到高岱长组实地学习，才知道间苗并不难，我们回到组里也要间我们组的庄稼。由于妇女积极参加夏锄，使两屯的铲?间苗工作进展得很快。高岱长组由于有妇女参加间苗工作，就腾出了二十四名男劳力专门铲地。该组目前已铲?完头遍，正在铲?二遍。组长高岱长很满意地说：“小苗刚出土时，我一看苗眼这么宽，怎么间？要不是妇女参加生产，活就够干的。”为了做好追肥工作，两屯的妇女除了积极参加间苗外，还积极准备粪肥，仅邹凤楼农业生产合作社的王淑云等十五名社员，就攒了小灰五千斤、鸡鸭粪和其他粪肥四千斤。
    这两个屯的妇女所以能积极地、大量地参加到夏锄工作中来，主要是当地区村干部在组织和发动妇女参加生产时解决了以下几个问题：
    一、合理计算劳动报酬，贯彻了同工同酬的原则。去年这两个屯在组织妇女参加生产中有偏向，妇女虽做了同样工作，但没有得到同样的报酬。去年邹凤山组的妇女，薅一天苗、铲一天地，只算半个工，最多的也只算七分工；但她们妇女薅地时，男人都赶不上，这就影响了妇女参加生产的积极性。为了使妇女能够积极参加生产，今年这两个屯都纠正了以前的偏向，多数互助组把妇女可能做的活计（间苗等），制定出标准工包给妇女。如高岱长组定出每间一垧大豆给十五个工，由妇女按垅分钱。为了使标准工能够订得准确，使双方都不吃亏，各组、社就在间每一样庄稼之前先做好试验。如邹凤楼社原先规定每间一垧大豆给十五个工，但因为地荒不好间，十五个工不够用，需要二十个工，社领导干部便及时改为二十个工，鼓励了妇女参加劳动的积极性，女社员王淑云、鞠忠秋间大豆时，每天都挣十分工，比有些男社员挣的还多。
    二、从多方面解决了妇女参加生产的具体困难。贯彻同工同酬虽刺激了妇女参加生产的积极性，但如果不能很好地解决妇女参加生产的具体困难，妇女仍然不能参加生产。妇女参加生产的最大困难是有孩子。她们提出：“又做活，又做饭，喂猪喂鸡再奶孩子，那还有功夫到地里去干活？”为了解决这个问题，这两个屯在组织妇女参加生产时，就组织了八名老太太看孩子，并动员妇女利用亲戚婆媳关系看管了十四名小孩，使十一名有孩子的妇女抽出身子参加了生产。各组、社都把有吃奶孩子的妇女分配在离屯近的地方做活，使有吃奶孩子的妇女能够按时奶孩子，消除了她们怕把小孩饿坏的顾虑，而安心参加生产。张连壁互助组为了照顾人手少的妇女家里喂猪喂鸡及做饭等零活，每天晌午、下晚都让她们提前半点钟回家。为了照顾妇女的体力和健康，各个组都规定了早晨妇女不下地，晌午休息一个钟头，歇气时和妇女回家奶孩子时的时间要长一点等等。因此，妇女都反映：今年夏锄可真是人财两旺，越干越有劲。
    三、培养典型，树立榜样，推动多数妇女参加生产。为了使一部分不愿参加生产的妇女也能参加生产，这两个屯找出了在群众中有威信、又能经常参加劳动的王淑云、唐凤珍、鞠忠秋等五名妇女骨干做样子。高岱长互助组有五名妇女第一次参加干活时，因为一时还不习惯，晚上回来后有的累得腰酸腿痛，情绪有些低落。该组的女生产组长唐凤珍就鼓励她们说：“我们头一天干活是累一点，可是我们要坚持干下去，身体就会壮起来。人家志愿军中的女同志和男同志一样在朝鲜战斗，我们在后方受这么一点累，就低头啦，那咱们怎能争取男女平等？”经她这一鼓励，她们第二天又坚持下地干活了。她们说：人家唐凤珍、王淑云都能干，我们也不能落后！
    四、在进行生产的过程中，要教妇女学会生产技术。妇女参加生产的热情虽高，但对农业技术掌握的很差，有些互助组的组员因为害怕妇女间不好苗，不愿叫妇女间自己的庄稼。为了解决这个问题，干部在间苗前就组织妇女学习了间苗技术；在开始间苗时，各组又都事先由组内的间苗能手做样子，教不会间苗的妇女学习。高岱长组在刚开始间苗时，由到县里学过间苗技术的唐凤珍，在大豆地中先间出样子，间成双苗眼，每隔三四寸远留一棵苗子。妇女们学会了间苗技术之后，参加间苗的积极性也就提高了；各个互助组的组员们也就放心让妇女给自己间苗。为了使妇女的生产技术水平不断地提高和改进，各互助组中的技术推广员，都深入到田间做技术指导。邹凤楼社的技术推广员在地里发现有的女社员间大豆不合技术要求，就及时地告诉她改正了。
    在生产中发现妇女有缺点时，不要大吵大嚷，要耐心地教给改正办法，要提高她们学会农业技术的信心。邹凤楼社在间苗时有的女社员因刚学间苗，在间苗时有的草没锄净，社领导干部发现这个现象之后，就个别地告诉她们纠正了。
