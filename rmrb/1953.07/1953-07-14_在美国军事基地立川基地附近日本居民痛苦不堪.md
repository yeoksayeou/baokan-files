Xinhua News Agency, 13th (Tokyo dispatch): Even Japan's reactionary newspapers occasionally reveal the extent to which US military bases seriously endanger the lives of the Japanese people. Recently, the "Japan Weekly" published an article entitled "Tachikawa Military Base," describing the painful lives of Japanese residents near the massive US Air Force base, Tachikawa, near Tokyo.

The article first makes a clear comparison between Tachikawa's past and present, writing: "Ten years ago, Tachikawa was a quiet city located on the Tama River, facing clear streams." But today, "apart from the base, there is simply no sense of modernity at all, presenting a colonial landscape, constantly subjected to the roar and vibration of aircraft from morning till night."

The article acknowledges that Tachikawa Base severely disrupts the lives of local people, and even the water necessary for daily life is contaminated by the US military. The article writes: "What distresses residents the most is the 'stinky well' problem, which is deeply related to daily life. Due to oil from the vast US Far East Air Force airfield seeping into the ground, all the well water has a petroleum odor. Although the citizens have been demanding water supply for a long time, not only does the well water remain smelly, but there have been incidents of wells catching fire and rivers burning. What is even more alarming is that a well digger, whose shovel hit a stone and caused a fire, was burned all over and eventually died."

Fires caused by water contaminated with oil from the US military are frequent. The article gives an example: "When heating water in the bathroom, if one is not careful, the fire in the stove will connect and burn with the water in the bathtub, and even the bathroom will be burned down. Such things happen from time to time." Not only that, "the Midori River (river name) that passes through the city is covered with waste oil flowing from the base. When pedestrians mistake it for river water and throw cigarette butts or matches into the river, a large fire will ignite on the surface of the water. As a result, the nearby markets and stalls have been burned down more than once."

Like other US military bases, Tachikawa Base is filled with the ugly and filthy traces of American soldiers, which have a serious negative impact on society. The article acknowledges that because "bars, brothels, and lewd theaters are lined up in rows on the streets," "problems of children's education and the enrollment of mixed-race children have arisen, causing many tragedies."

### 在美国军事基地立川基地附近日本居民痛苦不堪

    在美国军事基地立川基地附近日本居民痛苦不堪
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：关于美国军事基地严重地危害日本人民生活的情形，即使是日本的反动报刊也时有透露。最近“日本周报”上登载了一篇题为“立川军事基地”的文章，叙述了东京附近美国庞大空军基地立川基地附近日本居民的痛苦生活。
    文章首先对立川的今昔作了个显明的对比写道：“十年前，立川是位于多摩川上，面临着清流的安静城市”。可是今天，“除了基地以外，简直连一点近代的感觉也没有，呈现着殖民地的风光，从早到晚处在机声隆隆的震动下。”
    文章承认立川基地严重地破坏了当地人民的生活，甚至连日常所必需的用水也被美军所沾污。文章写道：“最使居民苦恼的是和日常生活有深切关系的‘臭水井’的问题。由于庞大的美国远东空军机场上的石油浸入地下，使所有的井水有了石油臭味。虽然很久以前市民们就要求供给饮水，可是不仅是井水仍然臭着，而且发生了井中起火、河川燃烧的事情。更使人惊心的是，有一个掘井工人，由于他的铁锹碰到石头而起了火，结果全身烧伤，终于丧命。”
    被美军石油沾污了的水引起火灾的事情，是经常发生的。文章举例说：“浴室烧水时，一不小心，灶里的火就会和浴池的水连烧起来，连浴室都一齐被烧光的事情，时有发生”。不仅如此，“穿过市内的绿川（河名），水面上浮满了从基地流下来的废油，行人以为是河水而把烟头或火柴扔到河里时，水面上就会燃起一片大火。因此，曾不止一次地烧毁了附近的市场和摊棚。”
    立川基地和其他美国军事基地一样，到处显现着美国兵的丑态秽迹，给社会以严重的不良影响。这篇文章承认：由于“街头上栉比鳞次的开设着酒吧、妓馆和淫乱的戏院”，“引起了儿童教育和混血儿入学的问题，造成很多悲剧。”
