    I Actively Find Ways to Ensure I Don't Miss Work
    Yang Yugui
    My name is Yang Yugui, and I am a female roving worker in the No. 2 Fine Spinning Workshop of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. During the rule of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we workers were beaten and scolded all day long in the factory, so we regarded working as suffering and a shameful thing. After getting married, I stopped working. After liberation, my mother-in-law urged me to go to work in the factory again. Because I remembered the suffering that workers endured before liberation, I was very reluctant to go. My mother also firmly opposed it, thinking that if a daughter-in-law still had to go to work in the factory, wasn't that enough suffering? At that time, I heard people living in the same courtyard say that working in the factory now is very different from the reactionary rule in the past. I thought I might as well try it first. So I went to work at the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. After starting work, I was worried all day long, fearing that I would be subjected to the same oppression as before. Who knew that after working for more than a month, not only was I not beaten, but I wasn't even scolded once. I thought to myself that working now is really different from before. I felt happy from the bottom of my heart, and I was full of energy when I worked. At first, my mother cried when she found out I had gone to work, thinking that I would definitely suffer again. Later, when she saw that not only was I not beaten or scolded after going to work, but my life had also improved and I was very energetic at work, she also changed her past ideas and no longer thought that working was a bad thing. I not only felt happy working, but I wouldn't let anyone stop me from working! From then on, I regarded the factory as my own home. Whenever I entered the workshop and saw those machines, I felt happy, and I was always thinking about how to find ways to produce well.
    In order to produce well, I overcame many special difficulties for women. In three years, I only missed one day of work (excluding maternity leave). I have three children, the oldest is seven years old this year, the second is four years old, and the youngest is two years old and still breastfeeding. Plus, there are a total of eight children in the same courtyard, so I often couldn't sleep well, and I dozed off during the night shift. So, I first discussed with the mothers of the children in the same courtyard, telling them that the children's noise kept me from sleeping well, and that I dozed off at work in the factory, which affected production and let down the country and the people. I asked them to take good care of the children. At the same time, I knew that my mother-in-law was also working very hard at home taking care of household chores. Older people don't know how to buy things themselves, so I often bought some food and brought it back when I came home. After returning home, I would also talk to her about the things in the factory, telling her what plans I had made in the factory, so that she could know how important production is. This way, my mother-in-law would take the initiative to take care of the children for me, let me sleep well, and enable me to work well. The youngest breastfeeding child used to be fed twice a day. When there was a lot of cotton lint from the leather rollers, I would only feed him once, and my mother-in-law would make milk powder for him the other time, so that I could sleep a little longer, be more energetic when I went to work at the factory, and not delay production.
    Last year, there was a period when the quality of raw cotton was not good, and a lot of cotton lint came out of the leather rollers. I also got an eye disease. People living in the same courtyard all said to me, "Take a few days off! You earn so much money, what does it matter if you take a day off!" I thought that wasn't right. If I took a day off, the factory would definitely ask someone else to take care of my machine, and that person wouldn't know my machine well, and wouldn't know where the problems were. There would definitely be more cotton lint, which would bring greater losses to the country. I knew that my eye disease was not a serious illness, so I did not take a day off and continued to work as usual. In addition, I used the time after work to go to the hospital for treatment. After a few days, my eye disease got better, and I did not take a day off.
    I know that my happiness today is entirely brought to me by liberation. Our workers can only turn over under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Now that we have become the masters of the country, we should redouble our efforts, increase production, and build the country well. Therefore, I must not be complacent in production in the future. I must study hard, better abide by labor discipline, overcome difficulties, and ensure the completion of the production plan. Now, I have applied to join the Youth League, and in the future, I will strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

    我主动想办法使自己不缺勤
    杨玉桂
    我叫杨玉桂，是国营天津第二棉纺厂第二细纱车间的女看车工。在日寇、国民党反动统治的时候，我们工人在工厂里做工整天挨打受骂，所以把做工看成是受罪、丢人的事情。结了婚我就歇工不干了。解放以后，我婆婆又动员我到工厂里去做工，我因为想到解放前工人所受的那种苦处，心里很不愿意去，我母亲也坚决反对，认为做了媳妇还要到工厂里去做工，以前受的罪还不够吗？当时我听到同院住的人说现在工厂里做工和从前反动统治时候是大不一样了，我想不妨先去试试看再说。我就在第二棉纺厂上了工。上工之后，我整天提心吊胆的，恐怕再受从前那种压迫。谁知干了一个多月，不要说没有挨人家打，连骂也没有被人家骂过一句。我心想现在做工真是和从前不一样了，打从心眼里就觉得高兴，干活也满带劲了。起初，我母亲知道我上工后就哭了，以为我去做工一定又得受罪。后来看到我上工之后非但没有挨打受骂，而且生活也提高了，工作很带劲。她也改变了过去的想法，不再认为做工是件坏事了。我自己不但觉得干活高兴，就是谁要叫我不干也不行啦！从此以后，我就把工厂看作了我自己的家一样，一进车间看到那些机器，就觉得高兴，心中也总是捉摸着如何想办法好好生产。
    为了好好生产，我克服了我们妇女的许多特殊困难，在三年中只缺勤一天（产假除外）。我有三个孩子，大孩子今年有七岁、第二个有四岁、最小的有二岁还在吃奶，加上同院的一共有八个小孩，因此，常闹得我睡不好觉，夜班工作时打盹。于是，我就先和同院孩子的妈妈商量，告诉她们小孩一闹我睡不好觉，到厂工作时打盹，影响了生产，对不起国家和人民。要求她们把孩子看好。同时我知道我婆婆在家中料理家事也是很辛苦的，年纪大的人自己又不会买东西，我回家时就经常买些吃的东西带回去，回家之后再和她谈谈厂里的事，告诉她我在厂中订了什么计划，使她能够知道生产是如何的重要，这样我婆婆就会主动地替我看好孩子，让我睡好觉，使我能够好好地工作。那个最小的吃奶孩子，原来是一天喂二次奶的，在皮辊花多的时候，我就只喂他一次奶，另外一次由我婆婆弄奶粉给他吃，这样可以让我多睡会儿觉，到厂工作精神好点，不会耽误生产。
    去年有一个时期，因为原棉质量不好，出皮辊花很多的时候，我又害了眼病，同院住的人都对我说：“你休息几天吧，赚那么多钱，歇个班又算嘛！”我想不对，我歇了班，厂里一定是叫别人代我看这部车，别人对我这部车也不了解，也不知道毛病在那儿，皮辊花一定会出得更多，给国家带来更大的损失。我知道我的眼病不是什么大病，所以没有歇班，还照常工作；另外我利用下班后的时间到医院去治疗，过了几天眼病也好了，我也没有歇班。
    我知道我今天的幸福完全是解放给我带来的。咱们工人只有在党和毛主席领导下才有翻身。现在我们成了国家的主人，正应该加倍努力，增加生产，把国家建设好。所以我今后一定要在生产上不自满、努力学习，更好地遵守劳动纪律，克服困难，保证完成生产计划。现在，我已经申请入团，将来我还要争取作个光荣的共产党员。
