Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th: The Yellow River Conservancy Commission held a flood control meeting for the lower reaches of the Yellow River from June 27th to 30th. Representatives from the People's Governments of Henan and Shandong provinces participated. The meeting emphasized the great significance of this year's flood control work for national economic construction, criticized various slack and complacent ideas, and required all localities to assign capable cadres to form flood control command organizations. During the flood season, levee should continue to be probed to eliminate hidden dangers.

Based on the current situation of the Yellow River, the meeting formulated the 1953 Yellow River Flood Control Work Plan. The meeting studied relevant issues regarding the use of flood detention areas and spillway weirs, and formulated a defense plan based on the current highest flood data of the Yellow River. The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters was established at the meeting. Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, was appointed as the director, and Wang Zhuoru, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, were appointed as deputy directors. The headquarters has now started working.

Xinhua News Agency: The flood season in the Yangtze River basin is approaching, and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government is strengthening flood control preparations. The Municipal Flood Control Headquarters recently studied the areas in Wuhan that are prone to accidents during the flood season in previous years, and decided to establish flood control sub-headquarters in various districts and flood control sections in suburban townships to strictly guard against them; and made appropriate arrangements for some houses and crops near the river embankments that may endanger the safety of the embankments. The Municipal Flood Control Headquarters called on all institutions, troops, factory workers, and residents of Wuhan to be a hundred times more vigilant and strive to avoid accidents during this year's flood season to protect the safety of people's lives and property.

Xinhua News Agency: The rivers in the Southwest Region have entered the flood season, and flood control organizations have been established in various places. From June 1st, hydrological stations, water level stations, and rainfall stations in various places have been reporting water level, flow, rainfall, wind direction, wind force and other conditions to the relevant flood control agencies on a daily basis; if the water level rises sharply, additional reports will be made at any time to ensure that upstream water conditions are quickly transmitted and downstream preparations can be timely and adequate. At present, twenty-two flood reporting stations have been established in important areas along the Minjiang, Jialing River, and Tuo River in Sichuan Province. Xikang Province has established six flood reporting stations along the Dadu River and Yalong River to implement key flood prevention measures.

This year, in addition to strengthening flood control for important rivers, the Southwest Region is also paying special attention to flood control in mountainous areas. Residents along rivers, streams, and mountain creeks in various places are responsible for flood control by sections. They have universally organized rescue teams to strengthen the inspection, repair, and protection of flood control embankments. Various places are also appropriately building water conservancy projects that benefit both irrigation and flood control. Sichuan Province has decided to build larger flood control projects in Qianjiang and Wanyuan.

    黄河长江两流域加紧防汛准备
    西南各河流进入汛期各地居民积极防洪
    【新华社开封四日电】黄河水利委员会在六月二十七日到三十日召开了黄河下游的防汛会议。河南、山东两省人民政府都派代表参加。会议强调指出今年防汛工作对国家经济建设的重大意义，批判了各种松懈麻痹思想，要求各地抽派得力干部组成防汛指挥机构。在汛期中间，堤防应继续进行锥探，以消灭隐患。
    依据黄河目前的情况，会议制定了一九五三年黄河防汛工作方案。会议对使用滞洪区、溢洪堰的有关问题都作了研究，并根据目前黄河最高洪水资料制定了防御计划。会上成立了黄河防汛总指挥部。由河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃担任主任，山东省人民政府副主席王卓如、黄河水利委员会主任王化云任副主任。现在，总指挥部已开始办公。
    【新华社讯】长江流域汛期已近，武汉市人民政府正加强防汛准备工作。市防汛指挥部最近研究了武汉市历年汛期容易出险的地区，决定在各区成立防汛分部，郊区各乡成立防汛段，严加防守；并对江河堤岸附近有碍堤身安全的部分房屋和农作物作了适当的处理。市防汛指挥部号召武汉市的所有机关、部队、工厂的工作人员和武汉市居民百倍地提高警惕，争取在今年洪水期不出险，以保障人民生命财产的安全。
    【新华社讯】西南区各河流已进入洪水季节，各地已建立防汛组织。从六月一日开始，各地水文站、水位站、雨量站，已逐日向各有关防汛机构报告水位、流量、雨量、风向、风力等情况；若遇水位骤涨，并随时加报，做到上游水情迅速传递，下游准备工作能及时充分。目前，四川省岷江、嘉陵江、沱江沿岸重要地区已建立二十二个报汛站。西康省在大渡河、雅砻江沿岸设立六个报汛站，实行重点防洪。
    今年西南区除注意加强对重要江河的防洪外，还特别注意山区防洪。各地沿江河、山溪一带的居民都分段负责防洪。他们普遍组织了抢险队，加强防洪堤埝的检查、补修和守护工作。各地并适当地修筑对灌溉、防洪两利的水利工程。四川省决定在黔江、万源两地修建较大的防洪工程。
