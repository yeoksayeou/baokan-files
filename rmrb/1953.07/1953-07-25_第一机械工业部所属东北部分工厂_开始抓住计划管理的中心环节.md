Northeast factories under the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, including most machinery, electrical engineering, and shipbuilding plants, have begun or are preparing to begin strengthening the planning management work around the formulation and implementation of work plans, to gradually achieve the goal of comprehensively and balancedly fulfilling the national production plan. In some enterprises, cadres are organized to study documents related to strengthening planning management, unify ideological understanding, and expose the main problems of the enterprise in the past in the preparation and implementation of work plans. At the same time, key pilot projects are carried out in workshops or work sections. Therefore, their work has progressed relatively quickly. For example, when Machinery Plant No. 1 was studying, it realized that the past monthly work plan preparation time was too long, and it was difficult to control during execution; the past management of work sections was too weak to control the flow of components and parts being processed on a daily and hourly basis. The processing of some components could not be completed according to the work plan. It was not until the components entered the warehouse that it was known that they were not completed. At this time, materials had to be re-invested, and rush processing had to be done, which disrupted balanced production. Therefore, starting in June, the plant formulated periodic work plans every ten days, and focused on the fourth work section of the second workshop to strengthen the work section plan management work. After three cycles of practice in June, the fourth work section has created a set of management methods that can control the flow of work-in-progress by the hour, achieving the goal of completing the plan in a balanced manner on a cycle-by-cycle basis. In the study of Machinery Plant No. 3, it was recognized that although the equilibrium rate of the assembly workshop in the past was very high, it was maintained by relying on excessive component reserves, which affected the company's capital turnover. The equilibrium rate of the processing workshop was very low, and there were often rush phenomena. Now, the plant is overcoming the complacency of some cadres who are unwilling to carry out balanced production by further strengthening the management of the enterprise, and is starting to improve the labor organization of the processing workshop and strengthen the management of the work section. At the beginning, Machinery Plant No. 5 decided to focus on strengthening original records, but in the key pilot project, it was found that strengthening original records in isolation could not organize the original records well, and even if they were organized well, it could not achieve the purpose of balanced production. Therefore, it focused on formulating and implementing work plans, organizing similar specialized work sections; equipped with a chief work section leader and a duty work section leader, and organized a work section leader training class to strengthen the leadership of the work section; established a three-level dispatching organization of the factory, workshop, and work section, and formulated and implemented a dispatching responsibility system to strengthen the dispatching work. As a result, the work plan was initially realized, and the balanced production rate was improved. Since the Shipbuilding Company formulated and implemented work plans in April, it has basically eliminated the rush phenomenon of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end.

However, judging from the situation of the Northeast factories under the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the strengthening of planning management in many factories is progressing relatively slowly. Many factories are still in the stage of unifying ideological understanding, investigating and researching the situation, and formulating and discussing action plans. Some factories are still stuck in the stage of studying documents and unifying ideological understanding. The main reason why the work of these factories is developing slowly is not that the leading cadres of these factories do not attach importance to planning management work, but that they hope to make the planning management work perfect all at once, instead of from point to surface, from rough to refined, from low-level to high-level, and gradually improve in practice. Therefore, they consider various conditions over and over again, and feel that this is not mature, and that is not mature. At the same time, they also hope to find the best specific method in the documents, so they hesitate to move forward. There are also a few factory cadres who have not yet realized that the formulation and implementation of work plans is the central link in strengthening planning management, and are still arguing about the question of "where to start." For example, the production section chiefs of Machinery Plant No. 9 and No. 13 believe that it is impossible to carry out work plans if problems such as untimely supply of raw materials, untimely equipment maintenance, poor quality, and slack labor discipline are not resolved. They do not want to gradually solve these problems through the preparation and implementation of work plans, but hope that others will do everything well before they carry out work plans. Some cadres in individual factories, such as Electrical Engineering Plant No. 7, do not seriously learn from the experience of other factories, and are still asking the higher authorities to clearly stipulate whether planning management "is the responsibility of the planning section or the production section." Electrical Engineering Plant No. 9 and No. 14 were still emphasizing the variability of production tasks in early July, waiting for the conditions for production specialization to arrive before starting. They did not know that planning management is particularly needed precisely because production tasks are variable. It was not until the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CPC deployed the work of strengthening planning management that the factory's leading cadres asked the section chiefs to "consider, consider." Electrical Engineering Plant No. 14 handed over the planning management work to a few people in the production section. When the production section came up with a plan and asked the leaders to "support" it, the leading cadres agreed to "support" it, but emphasized objective difficulties.

In strengthening planning management, most factories have not done a good job in carrying out political work around the preparation and implementation of work plans. In this regard, only Machinery Plant No. 2, No. 12, No. 18, No. 21, and the Shipbuilding Company have done a better job. Their main characteristic is to carry out labor competitions in workshops or offices around the preparation and implementation of work plans, and to promote advanced experience. For example, although the entire work of strengthening planning management in Machinery Plant No. 12 is still in the stage of investigating and researching the situation, the trade union has already organized workers to carry out competitions to improve the equilibrium rate, increase the attendance rate, and reduce the reject rate; the main content of the workers' competition organized by the trade union of the Shipbuilding Company is to complete and overfulfill the plan according to the work schedule, ensure quality, and ensure safe production at the same time. Other factories rarely combine political work with central work. Many factory trade unions organize competitions, but they put forward slogans such as "establish advanced thinking," "actively study," "strengthen unity," and "pay attention to hygiene" in an isolated and abstract way. Therefore, although the masses of employees have been mobilized enthusiastically, the role in implementing the central work is not great. This situation must be changed for planning management work to proceed smoothly.

    第一机械工业部所属东北部分工厂
    开始抓住计划管理的中心环节
    第一机械工业部所属东北大部分机械、电工及造船厂，都已开始或准备开始围绕着制订和贯彻作业计划，加强企业的计划管理工作，以便逐步地达到全面地均衡地完成国家生产计划的目的。在有些企业中，一面组织干部学习有关加强计划管理的文件，统一思想认识，揭发企业过去在编制和贯彻作业计划中的主要毛病，一面在车间或工段进行重点试办工作。因此，他们的工作进展得比较快。如机械一厂在学习时，认识到过去每月编一次作业计划的时间太长，在执行中不好掌握；过去工段管理太薄弱，不能按日按时控制在加工中的部件、零件的流动情况，有些部件的加工不能按作业计划完成，一直等到部件入库时，才知道没有完成，这时才不得不重新投料，突击加工，这就破坏了均衡生产。因此该厂从六月份起，就以每十天为一期编周期作业计划，并且以第二车间第四工段为重点，加强工段计划管理工作。经过了六月份三个周期的实践，第四工段已经创造了一套能按小时控制在制品流动情况的管理方法，达到了按周期均衡完成计划的目的。机械三厂在学习中认识了过去装配车间的均衡率虽然很高，但那是依靠过大的部件储备量来维持的，影响企业资金周转，加工车间的均衡率很低，时常有突击现象。现在，该厂正在克服一部分干部不愿以进一步加强企业的管理来进行均衡生产的自满情绪，着手改善加工车间的劳动组织，加强工段的管理工作。机械五厂在开始的时候，决定以加强原始记录为重点，但在重点试办中发现孤立地加强原始记录，不能把原始记录整理好，即使整理好了，也不能达到均衡生产的目的。因而又以制订和贯彻作业计划为中心，组织同类型专业化工段；配备总工段长和值班工段长，组织工段长训练班以加强工段领导；建立厂部、车间、工段三级调度组织，制订和贯彻调度责任制，以加强调度工作。于是，作业计划得以初步实现，均衡生产率有所提高。造船公司自四月份编制与贯彻作业计划以来，基本上消灭了前松后紧的突击现象。
    但是，从第一机械工业部所属东北各厂的情况来看，许多工厂加强计划管理工作进展得是比较慢的。有很多工厂还处在统一思想认识、调查和研究情况，制订和讨论行动计划的阶段。有些工厂还停留在学习文件，统一思想认识阶段。以上这些工厂的工作开展得慢的主要原因，并不在于这些厂的领导干部不重视计划管理工作，而在他们希望一下子就把计划管理工作做得十全十美，而不是由点到面，由粗而精，由低级到高级，在实践中逐步提高。因此，他们把各种条件考虑来考虑去，觉得这也不成熟，那也不成熟，同时又希望在文件中找到最好的具体办法，因此犹疑不前。也有少数工厂的干部，还没有认识制订和贯彻作业计划是加强计划管理的中心一环，现在还争论着“从何入手”的问题。如机械第九厂和十三厂的生产科长认为原材料供应不及时、设备检修不及时、质量不高、劳动纪律松弛等问题不解决，无法搞作业计划，他们不想通过编制和贯彻作业计划，来逐步解决这些问题，而希望别人把一切条件都做好了，自己才搞作业计划。个别的厂如电工七厂的一些干部，不认真学习其它工厂的经验，还在要求上级明确规定计划管理“到底是由计划科负责，还是由生产科负责。”电工第九厂和十四厂七月初还在强调生产任务多变，等待生产专业化的条件来临才动手。他们不知道正因为生产任务多变，才特别需要计划管理。等到中共中央东北局、中共沈阳市委向下布置加强计划管理工作以后，厂的领导干部才找科长来“考虑、考虑”。电工十四厂把计划管理工作交给生产科的少数人去做，生产科把方案做出来，要求领导方面“支持”时，领导干部一面答应“支持”，一面都强调客观困难。
    在加强计划管理中，大部分工厂都没有很好地围绕着编制与贯彻作业计划，开展政治工作。在这一方面，现在只有机械二厂、十二厂、十八厂、二十一厂和造船公司做得比较好，其主要特点是围绕着编制与贯彻作业计划开展车间或科室的劳动竞赛，推广先进经验。如机械十二厂，虽然整个加强计划管理工作还处在调查研究情况的阶段，但工会却已组织工人开展以提高均衡率、提高出勤率、降低废品率为内容的竞赛；造船公司工会组织工人竞赛的主要内容，是按作业进度完成与超额完成计划、保证质量，同时又要安全生产。其他各厂很少把政治工作与中心工作结合起来。很多工厂工会组织竞赛，但却孤立而抽象地提出“树立先进思想”，“积极学习”，“加强团结”，“注意卫生”等口号。因此，虽然也把职工群众轰轰烈烈地发动起来了，但对贯彻中心工作的作用却不大。这种情况必须改变，计划管理工作才能顺利进行。
