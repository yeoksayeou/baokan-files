    Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd. The Sanhe Sluice project on the lower reaches of the Huai River is undergoing intense final construction. More than 60,000 laborers are rushing to excavate the downstream diversion channel of the sluice and build the river-blocking earth dam. Once these projects are completed, the entire Sanhe Sluice project will be finished.

    The installation of the huge sluice's machinery was completed in mid-June. In order to remove the five hills, 23 meters above sea level, on the riverbed of the downstream diversion channel of the sluice, a total of 1.3 million cubic meters of earth needs to be excavated, of which one-half was completed by the end of June. The river-blocking earth dam is rapidly extending towards the center of the river. However, since June, the water level of Hongze Lake has gradually risen, and the construction period is becoming increasingly tight. The Sanhe Sluice Project Headquarters immediately organized all employees to join the battle against the flood. Each labor brigade launched a red flag competition, using the method of evaluation and rewards to promptly commend and reward more than 300 advanced units and more than 4,000 model individuals. More than 7,000 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the laborers took the initiative to unite the masses, overcoming difficulties such as narrow cross-sections, steep slopes, and long transportation distances, and labor efficiency has generally improved. At present, the work efficiency of the laborers is still continuously improving. Within a 500-meter transportation distance, more than 10,000 people have exceeded one cubic meter per day. In advanced units, each person has reached 1.8 cubic meters per day. On June 30, the Sanhe Sluice Project Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of representatives of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists at the construction site. More than 600 representatives expressed on the spot that they would fight against the flood with a fighting attitude, strive to basically complete the downstream diversion channel and river-blocking dam project within ten days, and ensure the successful release of water from the Sanhe Sluice.

    淮河下游三河闸工程正进行最后施工
    【新华社蚌埠三日电】淮河下游三河闸工程正进行紧张的最后施工。六万多民工正在突击开挖闸身下游引河和修筑拦河土坝。这些工程完成后，整个三河闸工程即告完工。
    巨大水闸的机件安装工作早在六月中旬完成。为了削除闸身下游引河河道上拔海二十三公尺高的五个丘陵，共需开挖一百三十万土方，到六月底已完成二分之一。拦河土坝正迅速向河心伸延。但是六月份以来洪泽湖水位逐渐上涨，工期日益紧迫。三河闸工程指挥部立即组织全体员工投入与洪水赛跑的战斗。各民工总队先后开展了红旗竞赛运动，采用边评边奖的方法及时表扬和奖励了三百多个先进单位和四千多个模范人物。民工中七千多个共产党员和青年团员主动团结群众，克服了断面窄、坡陡和运距远等困难，劳动效率普遍提高。目前，民工的工作效率仍在不断提高。在五百公尺运距内，有一万多人超过了日做一公方。在先进的单位，每人每天已达一点八公方。六月三十日，中共三河闸工程委员会召开了工地共产党员、青年团员和积极分子代表会议。六百多个代表当场表示以战斗姿态和洪水决赛，争取在十天内基本完成下游引河和拦河坝工程，使三河闸胜利放水。
