Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 25th: The Third World Youth Congress is scheduled to open in Bucharest on the 25th. Since the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council’s Prague meeting in February passed the resolution to convene this congress, youths from countries around the world have enthusiastically responded and supported this resolution, conducting extensive preparatory work for the congress over the past few months.

The youth of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies attach great importance to this congress. They have selected their outstanding representatives to participate in the congress. The Soviet delegation consists of thirty people, including young workers, collective farmers, engineers, writers, and actors. The Chinese delegation was elected at the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation. The youth of fighting Korea and Vietnam have also sent their delegations to participate in the congress. These countries' youth delegations will bring the belief in peace and friendship between the youth of the peace camp countries and the youth of other countries to the congress.

In the capitalist world, the youth of various countries actively carried out preparatory work. Youth organizations in various countries widely publicized the significance of the congress among the youth masses through meetings, leaflets, and other means. In order to welcome the congress, the French Republican Youth League held a national congress, Myanmar held the All-Burma Youth Congress, Ceylon held the Second Youth Congress, and youth in Italy, Iran, and other countries also held national youth gatherings. Many countries' youth held various mass gatherings to elect representatives to attend the congress.

Youth organizations and individuals from various strata, political views, religious beliefs, and occupations in capitalist countries participated in the work of preparing for the congress. In the process of preparation, the mass base of the youth movement in various countries has greatly expanded. The delegations selected by various countries to participate in the congress include representatives of youth from all strata. For example, the British delegation includes Labour Party members, Communist Youth League members, students, miners, and young Protestants. The French delegation includes youth representatives from the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. The Italian delegation includes youth from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Liberal Party. The Indian delegation includes farmer youth from farmers' associations, students from Calcutta, and representatives from the Krishan Kanska Youth League. The Indonesian delegation includes representatives of youth organizations with different political views, such as the People's Youth League and the Indonesian National Student League. Youth organizations from India, Ceylon, Sudan, Iran, Britain, France, and other countries that have not yet joined the World Federation of Democratic Youth have also sent representatives to participate in the congress.

These representatives attending the congress will bring to the congress the common wishes and demands of the youth of all strata in capitalist countries and colonial countries. In the process of preparing for the congress, youth from different strata and with different political views gathered together to discuss their own problems and put forward their common demands. Such discussions attracted a wider range of youth in various countries to participate in the struggle to defend peace and defend youth rights. Youth in Italy, France, and Britain widely discussed issues such as youth solidarity and the defense of youth rights at gatherings preparing for the congress. West German youth put forward a request demanding that the Adenauer government establish one hundred and ten vocational schools, trade schools, and student dormitories, and increase the budget allocated to youth from 20 million marks to 500 million marks. A delegation composed of youth has submitted this request to the Adenauer government. The Second Youth Congress of Ceylon also passed a resolution demanding that the social and political status of youth be raised.

The extensive preparatory work carried out by youth from all over the world has made the Third World Youth Congress the congress that best represents the will of youth from all strata around the world, and a congress of great unity among youth around the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 24th (TASS): The secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued a press release stating that the Third World Youth Congress will open on July 25th at the Floreasca Hall in Bucharest. A large number of telegrams and letters are received daily from all over the world, congratulating the congress.

World Peace Council Vice-Chairman D'Arboussier, International Democratic Women's Federation President Mrs. Gordon, famous American singer Paul Robeson, and many other prominent leaders have written to the congress, expressing their full belief that the congress will produce positive results and make a great contribution to world peace. D'Arboussier said in his letter: This congress of youth representatives from various countries will surely cause a huge response. The congress will show that all youth are full of confidence in the enormous power that their united action can produce. The congress will become an important factor in easing the international situation, and will become evidence of the people of all countries striving for greater understanding of each other.

    各国青年热烈支持世界青年代表大会
    达波赛、戈登夫人、罗伯逊等写信向大会祝贺
    【新华社二十五日讯】布加勒斯特消息：第三届世界青年代表大会定于二十五日在布加勒斯特开幕。自从今年二月世界民主青年联盟理事会布拉格会议通过关于召开这届大会的决议以后，全世界各国青年热烈地响应和支持这个决议，几个月来为大会进行了广泛的筹备工作。
    苏联、中国和人民民主国家的青年很重视这届大会。他们选派了他们优秀的代表参加大会。苏联代表团由青年工人、集体农民、工程师、作家、演员等三十人组成。中国代表团是在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上选出的。战斗中的朝鲜和越南青年也派遣了他们的代表团参加大会。这些国家的青年代表团将把和平阵营各国青年与其他国家青年和平友好的信念带到大会上去。
    在资本主义世界，各国青年积极进行了筹备工作。各国青年组织通过举行集会、印发传单等方式，在青年群众中广泛宣传了大会召开的意义。为了迎接大会，法兰西共和青年联盟举行了全国代表大会，缅甸举行了全缅青年代表大会，锡兰举行了第二届青年代表大会，意大利、伊朗及其他国家青年也举行了全国性的青年集会。许多国家青年举行了各种各样的群众性集会，选举参加大会的代表。
    资本主义国家各种不同阶层、不同政治见解和宗教信仰、不同职业的青年组织和个人参加了筹备大会的工作。在筹备过程中，各国青年运动的群众基础大大地扩大了。各国所选出的参加大会的代表团中，就有着各阶层青年的代表。例如，英国代表团中有工党党员、共产主义青年团团员、学生、矿工、青年新教徒。法国代表团中包括激进社会党、社会党和人民共和党的青年代表。意大利代表团中有共产党、社会党和自由党的青年。印度代表团中包括农民协会组织的农民青年、加尔各答的学生，克里山·康斯卡尔青年同盟代表等。印度尼西亚代表团中有人民青年团、印尼全国大学生联盟等不同政治见解的青年团体代表。印度、锡兰、苏丹、伊朗、英国、法国和其他国家中一些还没有加入世界民主青年联盟的青年组织也派遣代表来参加大会。
    这些参加大会的代表，将把资本主义国家及殖民地国家各阶层青年的共同愿望和要求带到大会上来。在筹备大会过程中，各国不同阶层、不同政治见解的青年聚集在一起，讨论了他们的切身问题，提出了他们的共同要求。这样的讨论吸引了各国更广泛的青年参加保卫和平与保卫青年权利的斗争。意大利、法国和英国青年在筹备大会的集会中，广泛讨论了青年团结以及保卫青年权利等问题。西德青年提出了一项要求书，要求阿登纳政府建立一百十所职业学校、贸易学校和学生宿舍，并把预算中用于青年的拨款从两千万马克增加到五亿马克，一个由青年组成的代表团已把这个要求书交给了阿登纳政府。锡兰第二届青年代表大会也通过了要求提高青年的社会和政治地位的决议。
    全世界各国青年所进行的这样广泛的筹备工作，使得第三届世界青年代表大会成为最能代表全世界各阶层青年意志的大会，成为全世界青年大团结的大会。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特二十四日讯：世界民主青年联盟书记处向报界发表了一个公报，公报说：第三届世界青年代表大会将于七月二十五日在布加勒斯特弗洛雷斯卡大厅开幕。每天都收到从世界各地来的大批电报和信件，向大会祝贺。
    世界和平理事会副主席达波赛、国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人、美国著名歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊以及其他许多著名领袖都写信给大会，表示他们完全相信大会将产生积极的成果，并对世界和平作出巨大贡献。达波赛在信中说：这个各国青年代表大会一定会引起巨大的反响。大会将显示出全体青年对于他们一致行动所能产生的巨大力量满怀信心。大会将成为缓和国际局势的重要因素，将成为各国人民争取彼此更加了解的证据。
