Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 5th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary session on July 2nd. Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting, pointing out the significant changes that have taken place in the domestic political situation and the people's democratic movement in the past year.

Togliatti said: During this period, the Communist Party, various democratic forces, and the Italian people were directly threatened by a coup d'état carried out by the ruling group of the Christian Democratic Party, supported by a few party leaders.

However, it is not difficult to see that hidden behind this group is an even more dangerous group composed of upper echelons of the Vatican and a number of people who pursue the policies of American imperialism. This handful of reactionaries attempted to tamper with the Italian Republic's constitution by relying on the electoral system "reform" law, thereby leading Italy's entire political life towards reaction. If this plan were realized, then Italy's democratic constitutional system based on parliament would be replaced by another system, and progressive forces would not be able to fight for the interests of the working people in the environment of a capitalist democratic system, but would have to struggle under a reactionary system of open oligarchy.

Togliatti continued: However, the election on June 7th powerfully and resolutely thwarted the clerical faction's plan to carry out a coup d'état. The democratic and people's forces, full of determination to defend the democratic and republican system established by the Italian people, have experienced a fierce upsurge, gaining new prestige and new strength.

Togliatti continued: The vast unemployed masses hope for a new economic policy that provides jobs for everyone; many workers, farmers, and government employees who have been punished for defending their rights through strikes hope to abolish unjust sanctions; people of all strata have an urgent need to improve their lives and uphold justice. It can be said that these are the most important facts revealed by the results of the June 7th election.

Togliatti continued: Our task is to maintain closer contact with all dissatisfied citizens, turning their just aspirations into new forces in the movement to reform our social life. Therefore, we should strive to bring all state power institutions back to the democratic track in accordance with the results of the election. It is obvious that even to achieve a part of this goal, we must extensively mobilize the masses and carry out vigorous activities and struggles inside and outside the parliament.

Togliatti then spoke about the policies of the right-wing parties and the government, pointing out that the right-wing parties and the government continue to regard the 9.5 million left-wing voters as "enemies of the motherland." He said, "We demand an end to such a dictatorial form of government against half of the Italian people."

Togliatti said: In order to approach those masses who demand social reform, namely the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the most progressive part of the Christian Democratic Party masses, it is first necessary to timely defend the unity of the working class and the working people. The manifestation of this unity is the covenant of unified action between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and the policies of the immensely powerful organization—the Italian General Confederation of Labor. The Communist Party, which fights to establish this broad front, is the center of Italian political life, because the main factor in the current situation is the need to implement democratic and socialist reforms, which cannot be achieved if the working class does not participate in the leading forces of the country.

Togliatti finally said that in the current historical stage, we are the main factor in Italy's political and social progress. We can advance, and we are advancing victoriously, so the whole of Italy will advance as well.

### 陶里亚蒂在意共中央全会上提出当前任务  争取国家政权回到民主轨道上来

    陶里亚蒂在意共中央全会上提出当前任务
    争取国家政权回到民主轨道上来
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议于七月二日举行。意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂在会上作了报告，指出最近一年来国内的政治形势和人民民主运动所发生的重大变化。
    陶里亚蒂说：在这一时期内，共产党、各种民主力量和意大利人民遭到了为一些少数党派党魁所支持的天主教民主党领导集团实行政变的直接威胁。
    然而不难看出，隐蔽在这一集团后面的是一个梵蒂冈上层分子和一批奉行美帝国主义政策的人所组成的更危险的集团。这一撮反动派，企图依靠选举制“改革”法来篡改意大利共和国宪法，从而使意大利的整个政治生活趋向于反动。如果这一计划实现了，那末意大利以议会为基础的民主宪法制度就要为另一种制度所代替，进步的力量就不可能在资本主义民主制度的环境下争取劳动人民的利益，而不得不在公开的寡头统治的反动制度下作斗争。
    陶里亚蒂继续说道：可是，六月七日的选举有力而坚决地使教权派进行政变的计划遭到了破产。满怀着用全力保卫意大利人民所建立起来的民主、共和制度决心的民主和人民的力量有了猛烈的高涨，有了新的威信和新的力量。
    陶里亚蒂继续说：广大的失业群众希望有一个使大家都有工作的新经济政策；因采取罢工方式保卫自己权利而被处罚的许多工人、农民和政府职员都希望取消不正义的制裁；各阶层的人民都有改善生活和主持正义的迫切要求。可以说，这些就是六月七日选举结果所表明的最重要的事实。
    陶里亚蒂继续说道：我们的任务就是：坚决与一切不满意的公民保持更密切的联系，使他们的正义愿望化为争取革新我们社会生活运动的新的力量。因此，我们应该争取一切国家政权机构随着选举的结果而回到民主的轨道上来。明显得很，即使要达到这个目标的一部分，我们也非去广泛地动员群众、在议会内外进行激烈的活动和斗争不可。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到右翼党派和政府的政策，指出右翼党派和政府继续坚持把九百五十万左翼的选民看作是“祖国的敌人”，他说：“我们要求结束这样一个反对半数意大利人民的独裁政府的形式”。
    陶里亚蒂说道：为了接近那些要求社会改革的群众，即共产党、社会党、社会民主党和最进步的一部分天主教民主党群众，首先必须及时地保卫工人阶级和劳动人民的团结一致，这种团结一致的表现就是共产党和社会党一致行动的公约和强大无比的组织——意大利全国总工会——的政策。为建立这一广大阵线而斗争的共产党是意大利政治生活的中心，因为目前局势的主要因素就是必须实行民主的和社会主义的改革，而如果工人阶级不参加到国家的领导力量中去，这种改革就无法实现。
    陶里亚蒂最后说道，在目前的历史阶段中，我们是意大利政治和社会进步的主要因素。我们能够前进，而且是在胜利地前进，所以整个意大利也会前进。
