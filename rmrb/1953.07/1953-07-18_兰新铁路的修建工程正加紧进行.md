Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 17th: Tens of thousands of railway employees and people of all ethnic groups building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are overcoming difficulties such as "June snowfall" and "flying sand and rocks," and are marching towards the Wushaoling Mountains, 3,000 meters above sea level, the Heihe Beach, which is six kilometers wide, and the uninhabited grasslands and Gobi Desert for hundreds of miles.

The construction project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is very large and arduous. There are about 1,900 bridges and culverts in the section from Lanzhou to Jiuquan (accounting for more than a quarter of the total length of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway), which is twice the number of all bridges and culverts on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. The Wushaoling construction area, which is under construction this year, requires enough soil to fill 120,000 train cars just to fill ten deep gullies. In the future, as the railway moves westward, it will also pass through three river beaches that are five kilometers wide and large areas of quicksand. Whether the temporary bridge over the dangerous Yellow River can be built according to plan is the key to whether the construction task west of the Yellow River can be completed. After accepting this task, the heroic workers of the Third Engineering Team of the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau often braved the severe cold of minus ten degrees Celsius to fight the turbulent river water and ice floes; the diving workers' steel helmets were filled with ice slag every time they came out of the water; their gloves turned into ice cubes, but they never flinched. When workers Tian Shulin, Xu Jiafu, and others erected steel cables on the Yellow River rapids, they were washed away by the water for more than one kilometer after their boat capsized. After being rescued, they immediately changed their clothes and continued to work, finally erecting the steel cables. The bridge builders adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and put forward many rationalization proposals, which finally enabled the Yellow River temporary bridge project to be completed one and a half days ahead of schedule. Trains carrying bulldozers, sleepers, steel rails, cranes, etc., passed through the temporary bridge to the construction site west of the river. At the foot of the Wushaoling Mountains, next to the snow-capped mountains, more than 40 bulldozers are rumbling. On the Heihe River beach, a famous wind tunnel, the drilling workers persisted in their work in the black wind where they could not see people on the opposite side. They created working methods such as the "mud slurry grouting pit wall method," which prevented the pit walls from collapsing and doubled efficiency. In the engineering section west of Yongdeng in Hexi, 4,000 workers set up tents along the Great Wall, and they are building a large bridge over the Zhuanglang River.

The construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is progressing rapidly. Now, trains are rolling on the newly laid tracks, and the oil produced by the Yumen Oil Mine has begun to be transported by train. The economic value of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is increasingly becoming apparent.

    兰新铁路的修建工程正加紧进行
    【新华社兰州十七日电】修筑兰新铁路的数万个铁路员工和各族民工，正在克服“六月降雪”和“飞砂走石”的困难，向拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭、宽达六公里的黑河滩以及百里无人烟的草滩和戈壁滩进军。
    兰新铁路的修建工程十分浩大而且艰巨。从兰州到酒泉一段（占兰新路全长四分之一强）的桥涵约有一千九百座，等于天兰铁路全部桥涵的两倍。今年施工的乌鞘岭工区，仅填塞十个深沟所需的泥土，就可装满十二万个火车皮。将来铁路西移，还要经过三处五公里宽的河滩和大片的流沙地带。在天险的黄河上能否按计划修好便桥，是黄河以西施工任务能否完成的关键。英勇的西北铁路干线工程局第三工程队的工人们，在接受了这个任务后，就经常冒着零下十多度的严寒，在湍急的河水里和冰块作搏斗；潜水工人每次从水里上来，钢帽里积满了冰渣；手套变成了冰块，但是他们从不畏缩；工人田树林、徐家富等七人在黄河急流上架钢丝绳时，因翻了船被水冲走一公里多远，他们被救起后，又立刻换上衣服继续工作，终于架好了钢丝绳。架桥工人们采用了苏联的先进经验，并提出了许多合理化建议，终于使黄河便桥工程提前一天半完成。一列一列的载着推土机、枕木、钢轨、吊车等的运料列车，就通过便桥运往河西工地。在乌鞘岭下，傍着终年积雪的大山，四十多部推土机在隆隆开动。在著名的风库——黑河河滩上，钻探工人就在对面看不见人影的黑风里坚持着工作，他们创造了“泥浆灌注坑壁法”等工作方法，使坑壁不致陷塌，效率提高一倍。在河西永登以西的工程段，四千个工人沿着长城架起篷帐来，他们正在庄浪河上架设大桥。
    兰新铁路的修建工程进展很快，现在，列车正滚动在新铺好的轨道上，玉门油矿出产的石油已开始改由火车运输。兰新铁路的经济价值正在日益地显现出来。
