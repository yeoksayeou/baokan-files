A Historic Party Congress
——Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party
Soviet Union A. A. Qixiang, En. Kiliayev

    Fifty years ago, on July 30, 1903, the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party opened, laying the foundation for the existence of a revolutionary democratic party of the Russian working class.

    The party's brilliant founder, Lenin, established the working-class party on the firm theoretical foundation of the teachings of Marx and Engels. As a representative of creative Marxism, Lenin instructed that Russian socialists must independently study Marx's doctrine, as it only provided general guiding principles that must be adapted to the characteristics of each country's development when specifically applied. The experience of the international revolutionary movement, as well as the experience of the Russian revolutionary movement, must be considered when establishing the Russian working-class party. Lenin also pointed out that the "processing" of all these materials should be carried out independently, because "we have nowhere to find ready-made examples."

    The various social parties of the Second International that existed at that time could not serve as examples of Marxist parties. These parties were founded under conditions of bourgeois democratic freedom and operated under conditions of relatively peaceful development of capitalism. They increasingly degenerated, adapting to peaceful parliamentary activities, and did not fundamentally propose the task of overthrowing capitalism.

    In Russia, the Marxist party was established in a different environment, under the conditions of the imperialist era, where the contradictions of capitalism had become extremely acute and the proletarian revolution had become a direct practical issue. Russia was on the eve of the 1905-1907 revolution – the first bourgeois democratic revolution in the era of imperialism. The vanguard of this revolution was the world's most revolutionary proletariat, with the serious ally of the numerous and oppressed peasantry.

    The Russian Marxist revolutionary party was established under conditions of brutal political terror. The outstanding elements of the working class were subjected to endless persecution by the Tsarist regime. Any expression of progressive thought was suppressed. Furthermore, the greater difficulty in establishing a Marxist party lay in the need to smash the ideology of the Populists, which affirmed that the masses were passive; to expose the "Legal Marxists," who attempted to distort Marxism and adapt it to the interests of the bourgeoisie; and to defeat the "Economists," who attempted to cultivate the ideas of international opportunism and Bernsteinism in Russia. Lenin pointed out that the "Economists," like their Western European partners, followed a line of rejecting revolutionary struggle, rejecting socialism, and rejecting the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    It was necessary to establish a new type of revolutionary Marxist party that, both in terms of its ideological armament and its fighting organization, would be able to lead the working class in its struggle, first to overthrow the Tsarist regime and then to strive for the victory of the socialist revolution. It was necessary to establish a party free from opportunistic influences, irreconcilable towards compromisers and speculators, and adopting revolutionary means against the bourgeoisie and its state power.

    The great Lenin established precisely such a party in Russia. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by the genius Lenin fifty years ago, has grown into a tremendous force, and under Lenin's leadership, and under the leadership of Lenin's student and successor – the great Stalin and his comrades-in-arms – this party has been tested and tempered in many battles.

    The First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, held in 1898, did not establish a party. It did not formulate a party program or party constitution, and the Central Committee of the party elected at that congress was also destroyed. Factionalism and organizational disorganization were dominant among the social democratic organizations in Russia at that time.

    The main task of the Second Congress was to establish a genuine Marxist party based on the program principles, organizational principles, and tactical principles put forward and formulated by Lenin's "Iskra" (Spark).

    At this congress, with great revolutionary enthusiasm and a deep conviction in the correctness of revolutionary Marxist ideas, with firm belief in the strength of the Russian working class, Lenin defended his plan to establish a revolutionary Marxist party. In the struggle against the opportunists, Lenin gave a very clear exposition of the revolutionary Marxist principles of the entire international workers' movement at that time.

    The most important issue of this congress was the adoption of the party program.

    During the discussion of the draft party program provided by the "Iskra," a dispute arose regarding the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The opportunists opposed the Marxist demand for the dictatorship of the proletariat, because they did not consider overthrowing capitalism as their task at all. At that time, they also used the excuse that no party in the Second International had put forward the item of the dictatorship of the proletariat in its party program. Lenin and his supporters defended the requirement for the dictatorship of the proletariat in the party program in the struggle against the opportunists.

    Another major programmatic issue was the question of the proletariat's allies in the revolution. The fate of the revolution depended on who the peasants would follow – the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. At the congress, the opportunists opposed the inclusion of the peasant question in the party program, because they did not want revolution at all, so they discriminated against the peasants, the working class's allies. Because they opposed the leadership of the proletariat in the bourgeois democratic revolution, they denied the revolutionary role of the peasants, and denied that the proletariat could lead the peasants. Contrary to them, Lenin pointed out that the proletariat would win the peasants over to the side of the revolution, and that the proletariat, under the leadership of its party, could also isolate the liberal bourgeoisie and seize the leadership of the revolution.

    A principled struggle unfolded when the national question was discussed at the congress. The Bundists put forward the opportunistic, bourgeois nationalist demand for national cultural autonomy, which ran counter to the Marxist demand for national self-determination. This demand advocated abandoning proletarian internationalism and fostered national oppression. The Russian Marxists, headed by Lenin, dealt a fatal blow to this bourgeois nationalist tendency.

    The congress adopted Lenin's program. This program was a truly scientific and revolutionary program, and under the banner of this program, the Bolsheviks led the victorious struggle of the working class and the laboring peasants against Tsarism and capitalism.

    The Second Congress adopted the party constitution. Lenin gave a report on this issue. The organizational principles of the Marxist party were clearly expressed in the draft party constitution. On the first article of the party constitution – regarding membership qualifications – a sharp division occurred between the Marxist, revolutionary part of the congress and the opportunistic part. The article proposed by Lenin stated that anyone who recognized the party program, materially helped the party, and participated in a party organization could be a party member. The opportunistic part of the congress did not recognize participation in a party organization as a condition for membership, and opened the door wide to those careerists and unprincipled non-proletarian elements.

    The struggle between the two different articles on membership qualifications was a struggle between the Marxist principles of proletarian centralism and discipline and the opportunistic principles of petty-bourgeois individualism and anarchistic disorganization.

    The party demanded by Lenin's supporters was a centralized, monolithic, unified organization of ideological and action unity. They regarded the party as an organized army in which individual members were not self-enrolled, but were accepted into the party by a party organization, and they had to obey the iron discipline of the party. At the same time, the party organization should guarantee practical supervision of the work of each party member.

    Due to the split among the Iskra supporters, the opportunistic article of Martov was passed by a majority vote when the first article of the party constitution was voted on at the congress.

    At the end of the congress, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party split into two factions. Those who supported Lenin, the truly revolutionary Marxists, gained a majority vote in the election of the central organs of the party and began to be called Bolsheviks, while those who opposed them received a minority vote and were called Mensheviks.

    The congress consolidated the victory of Marxism over the "Economists." After the congress passed the party program and party constitution, the Social Democratic Party was established and the unified party began to take shape. However, the congress failed to live up to its responsibility on organizational issues, because it did not thoroughly expose and smash the Mensheviks' opportunistic stance on organizational issues.

    After the congress closed, the struggle between the revolutionary and opportunistic factions within the party intensified. The opportunists wanted to pull the party backward, leading to organizational disorganization, factionalism, and handicraft methods. They carried out rampant propaganda against the idea of party spirit and party discipline. Under the conditions of the approaching revolution, this propaganda was intended to separate the working class from political leadership, thereby extinguishing the revolution.

    Lenin's supporters smashed the Mensheviks' opportunistic stance on organizational issues, defended the party spirit against factionalism, and defended the party against saboteurs.

    Lenin summarized the Second Congress in his book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," and gave a profound analysis of the struggle between the revolutionary and opportunistic factions within the party. In this work, the organizational basis of the Marxist party was formulated.

    Lenin taught that the Communist Party is the advanced, Marxist, and organized detachment of the working class, and is the highest form of all working-class organizations. The party is the embodiment of the link between the advanced detachment of the working class and the millions of masses of the working class. The party must be organized according to the principle of centralism, and must have a unified party constitution, unified party discipline, and a unified leadership core. To maintain the unity of its ranks, the party must implement a unified proletarian discipline, that is, a discipline that all party members – whether leaders or ordinary members – must equally abide by.

    For the first time in the history of Marxism, Lenin elucidated the theory of the party, explaining that the party is the leading organization of the proletariat, and is the main weapon in the hands of the proletariat, without which it is impossible to win victory in the socialist revolution.

    The norms of party life and the principles of party leadership formulated by Lenin are the basic principles of party work. Their vitality has been verified by the entire glorious history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Half a century has passed since the founding of the party, and during this period, the party has won the greatest victories of worldwide historical significance in the struggle for the cause of the working class. During this period, the party has gone through a long and glorious journey, from the initial Marxist groups and organizations to the great Communist Party that now leads the powerful socialist state of workers and peasants and guides the Soviet people in the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

    For decades, the working people of Russia have practically tested all the main parties that existed in Russia: the Constitutional Democrats, the Mensheviks, the Social Revolutionaries, and the Communist Party. In the course of the development of revolutionary events, the various nationalities of the country abandoned all bourgeois parties and supported the Communist Party, believing that the Communist Party was the only party that represented their fundamental interests. The Communist Party is the people's own close party. In half a century, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has won the love and trust of the people with its loyal service.

    The experience of the party's fifty-year history proves that the connection with the masses is the basis of the party's invincibility and party leadership. If the party represents the fundamental interests of the masses and relies on the masses in its activities, the party is invincible.

    A half-century of history teaches us that the Communist Party is a fighting alliance of like-minded communists. Without revolutionary theory, without the combination of scientific socialism and the workers' movement, the proletariat can only grope in the dark. The strength of the Communist Party lies in the fact that it is armed with the knowledge of the laws of social development and political struggle, with the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, and the science of the construction of a communist society. Marxist-Leninist theory reflects the mature needs of the development of the material life of society, reflecting the interests of the laboring masses.

    Marxist-Leninist theory is an eternally vigorous, developing, and creative science, which is different from dogmatism. It is constantly enriched by new experiences, new knowledge, new summaries, and conclusions adapted to the new historical environment.

    The reason why the Communist Party has gained and is gaining victory in its struggle for the cause of the working class is that it has always defended the unity of its ranks with the greatest firmness and thoroughness in the past and present. This unity is guaranteed on the basis of revolutionary policies and on the basis of a principled struggle for Leninist ideas. The steel-like unity of the party is the source of the party's strength and invincibility.

    The greatest strength of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies in the fact that it constantly and courageously exposes the shortcomings in its own work, drawing new strength in carrying out criticism and self-criticism and further struggling for the victory of communism.

    Under the conditions of the victory of socialism and the gradual transition to communism, criticism and self-criticism acquire special significance. Criticism and self-criticism are the true motive force of development, and are powerful tools in the hands of the Communist Party to overcome shortcomings in work and educate cadres. Criticism and self-criticism is a powerful tool that the party can use to eliminate the undesirable phenomena in Soviet social life and eliminate the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness.

    The most important conclusion drawn from the analysis of the party's half-century history is that the party's policy is correct. The policy of the Communist Party proceeds from the fundamental interests of the working people and is based on the objectively existing laws of social development.

    Due to its wise revolutionary policy, and due to the selfless struggle to realize these policies, the party has achieved achievements of worldwide historical significance in the struggle for the cause of the working class.

    The party once led the Russian working class in a heroic liberation struggle against Tsarism and capitalism, ensuring the victory of the Great October Revolution with its inspiring and organizational activities.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people created a new socialist industry with the greatest enthusiasm, established collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations armed with first-class machinery technology, and realized a cultural revolution in the Soviet Union. Due to the victory of socialism, the phenomenon of human exploitation of humans was eliminated in the Soviet Union. Under the guidance of Lenin-Stalin's national policy, the Communist Party liberated the nationalities of Russia from centuries of social and national oppression, overcame the economic and cultural backwardness of the previously oppressed nationalities, and united all the nationalities living in Russia into a fraternal family of Soviet nationalities. The party was the inspirer and organizer of the glorious historical victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, and is now victoriously leading the construction of communism.

    The Nineteenth Party Congress, which stipulated the main tasks of the party at the current stage, is a great landmark in the struggle for communism. The main tasks at present are to establish a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to continuously improve the material and cultural standards of society, to educate members of society with the spirit of internationalism and fraternal relations with the working people of all countries, and to strive to strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland to prevent enemy aggression.

    The recent July Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union particularly powerfully demonstrated the indestructible unity of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and demonstrated its combat readiness to complete the historical tasks in internal and external policy now facing the Soviet Union.

    The party's policy has been tested and tested in decades of struggle for the interests of the working people. It enjoys the infinite trust and active support of the people in the Soviet Union. The main concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government in domestic policy is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. The party mobilizes the creative forces of the Soviet people to struggle for the further prosperity of the Soviet Union, for new achievements in socialist industry and agriculture. The party relies on economic laws and utilizes the great superiority of the socialist system to accelerate the progress of Soviet society along the path of communism.

    The purpose of the Communist Party's policy is to further consolidate the alliance of workers and collective farm members and strengthen the friendship and unity of the Soviet nationalities. The party educates the masses with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and resolutely and irreconcilably struggles against any manifestation of bourgeois nationalism.

    The party is conducting communist education of the masses on a wider and more active scale. The Communist Party focuses on developing the masses' sense of social responsibility and a communist attitude towards labor and public property. The party educates the people with the spirit of Soviet patriotism and national friendship.

    In carrying out ideological work, the party starts from the following principle: Only the collective political experience and collective wisdom of the Party Central Committee, based on the scientific principles of Marxist-Leninist theory, can guarantee the correct leadership of the party and the state, guarantee the unwavering unity of the party ranks, and guarantee the victorious construction of communism in the Soviet Union.

    In our country, the highest principle of the leadership of the party and the state is its collectivity, unity, and consistency. Marxist-Leninism teaches us that the strictest observance of the principle of collectivity is the guarantee of correct leadership of the country, and is the most important condition for the Soviet state to advance towards communism.

    The party constantly leads the work of our state organs and social organs. The party follows the Leninist-Stalinist theory of the state, constantly consolidates the Soviet state, and raises the vigilance of the Soviet people in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies.

    The main concern of the Communist Party in foreign policy is to carry out a resolute and thorough struggle against the preparation and launching of new wars, and to struggle to maintain and consolidate peace. The party regards the protection and consolidation of the greatest achievements of all nations – the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, the continuous strengthening of the friendly relations between the Soviet people and the working people of other countries, and the strengthening of the permanent and unbreakable friendship with the great Chinese people and the working people of all people's democratic countries – as its duty.

            ×××

    The Second Party Congress, held half a century ago, was a turning point in the development of the Russian and international workers' movement. The advanced forces of the Russian working class, headed by the great Lenin, opened up a new path in history and set an example for the struggle for the revolutionary party of the working class. In the past half century, the party has accumulated the richest experience in struggle at all stages of the revolution. This experience and the great ideas of Marxist-Leninism are illuminating the reliable road for foreign working people to struggle for socialism and democracy, for the freedom and equality of all nations, and for lasting peace and fraternal mutual assistance among all nations.

    历史性的党代表大会
    ——纪念俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会五十周年
    苏联  阿·阿齐祥　恩·基列也夫
    五十年以前，一九○三年七月三十日，俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会开幕了，这次大会奠定了俄国工人阶级革命民主政党存在的基础。
    党的天才创始人列宁在稳固的马克思与恩格斯学说的理论基础上建立了工人阶级政党。作为创造的马克思主义的代表，列宁曾指示过，俄国社会主义者必须独立地研究马克思的学说，因为这种学说只提供了总的指导原则，在具体运用到每一个国家时须适应各国发展的特点。在建立俄国工人阶级政党时必须考虑到国际革命运动的经验，以及俄国革命运动的经验。列宁又指出，然而，“加工”所有这些材料时应该独立进行，因为“我们没有地方去找现成的例子”。
    当时曾存在的第二国际各社会党都不能作为马克思主义政党的范例。这些政党是在资产阶级民主自由的条件下成立的，是在资本主义较为和平发展的情况下进行活动的；它们日益蜕化，适应于和平的议会活动，根本不提出推翻资本主义的任务。
    在俄国，马克思主义政党是在另外一种环境下建立起来的，是在资本主义矛盾已极端尖锐化而无产阶级革命已成为直接实践问题的帝国主义时代的条件下建立的。在这种环境下需要一种新型的党，社会革命和无产阶级专政的党。
    二十世纪初由于工人运动的高涨，革命运动的中心由西方移向俄国，俄国当时成为帝国主义一切矛盾的集合点。俄国正处在一九○五—一九○七年革命——帝国主义时代第一次资产阶级民主革命的前夜。这次革命的前锋是世界上最革命的无产阶级，它有着人数众多并备受压迫的农民这个严正的同盟者。
    俄国马克思主义革命政党是在残酷的政治恐怖的条件下建立起来的。工人阶级的优秀分子遭到沙皇制度无尽的迫害。任何进步思想的表现都被镇压着。此外，建立马克思主义政党的更大困难还在于，要解决这一任务必须粉碎民粹派的思想，因为这种思想肯定群众是消极的；必须揭穿“合法马克思主义者”，他们企图歪曲马克思主义并使之适合于资产阶级的利益；还必须打垮“经济派”，因为他们企图在俄国培植国际机会主义与伯恩斯坦主义的思想。列宁曾指出，“经济派”也和他们西欧的伙伴们一样，他们的路线是拒绝革命斗争，拒绝社会主义和无产阶级专政。
    必须建立这样一个革命的马克思主义政党，它无论从自己的思想武装或战斗的组织性来说，都能够领导工人阶级起初为推翻沙皇制度，而后又为争取社会主义革命胜利的斗争。必须建立一个摆脱机会主义影响、同妥协者与投机家采取不调和态度、对资产阶级及其国家政权采取革命手段的政党。
    伟大的列宁在俄国所建立的正就是这样的党。天才的列宁在五十年前所创立的苏联共产党，已成长为一支巨大的力量，在列宁的领导下，在列宁的学生和继承者——伟大的斯大林及其战友的领导下，这个党已经过多次战斗的考验与锻炼了。
    一八九八年所举行的俄国社会民主工党第一次代表大会没有建立成政党，没有制订党纲和党章，这次大会所选出的党中央委员会，也被破获了。在俄国当时的社会民主组织间，小组习气和组织涣散的现象占居优势。
    第二次代表大会的主要任务，就是根据列宁的
    “火星报”所提出和制定的纲领原则，组织及策略原则来建立真正的马克思主义政党。
    列宁在这次代表大会上以伟大的革命热情和对革命的马克思主义思想的正确性的深信，以对俄国工人阶级力量的坚信卫护了自己建立革命的马克思主义政党的计划。在与机会主义者斗争中，列宁在代表大会上对当时整个国际工人运动的革命马克思原则，给予了极明确的表述。
    这次大会的最重要问题是通过了党纲。
    在讨论“火星报”所提供的党纲草案时，关于无产阶级专政问题曾发生了争论。机会主义者反对无产阶级专政的马克思主义要求，因为他们根本不把推翻资本主义当作自己的任务。当时他们还以第二国际没有一个政党曾在党纲中提出无产阶级专政一项为遁辞。列宁及其拥护者在与机会主义者斗争中捍卫了党纲中关于无产阶级专政的要求。
    另一个重大的纲领性的问题是关于无产阶级在革命中的同盟者问题。革命的命运取决于农民将跟着谁走——跟着资产阶级走还是跟着无产阶级走。机会主义者在大会上反对党纲中包括农民问题的要求，因为他们根本不想革命，所以他们对工人阶级同盟者的农民采取歧视态度。由于他们反对无产阶级在资产阶级民主革命中的领导权，他们便否认农民的革命作用，否认无产阶级能够引导农民。与他们相反，列宁指出，无产阶级将把农民争取到革命方面，无产阶级在其政党的领导下也能够孤立自由资产阶级并取得革命的领导权。
    在代表大会上讨论民族问题时展开了原则的斗争。崩得分子提出与马克思主义民族自决权的要求相对立的、机会主义的、资产阶级民族主义关于民族文化自治的要求，这个要求主张抛弃无产阶级的国际主义，而助长民族压迫。以列宁为首的俄国马克思主义者，对这种资产阶级民族主义的倾向给予了致命的打击。
    大会通过了列宁的纲领。这个纲领是真正科学和革命的纲领，在这一纲领的旗帜下布尔什维克领导了工人阶级与劳动农民反对沙皇制度及资本主义的胜利斗争。
    第二次代表大会通过了党章。列宁就这个问题作了报告。在党章草案中曾明确地表述了马克思主义政党的组织原则。关于党章第一项条文——关于党员资格——在大会的马克思主义的、革命的部分与机会主义部分之间发生了尖锐的分歧。列宁所提出的条文是说：凡承认党纲，在物质方面帮助党并参加党内某一组织者，皆得为党员。大会的机会主义部分不承认参加党内某一组织是党员的条件，而为那些野心家，无思想原则的非无产者分子大开入党之门。
    关于党员资格问题的两种不同的条文的斗争，是无产阶级的集中制和纪律性的马克思主义原则与小资产阶级个人主义及无政府主义涣散性的机会主义原则之间的斗争。
    列宁的拥护者所要求的党是集中的、一元的、统
    一思想和统一行动者的团结的组织。他们把党看作是有组织的部队，其中各个成员并不是自行列名入党，而是由党内某一组织接收入党，他们必须服从党的铁的纪律。同时党的组织应该保证对每个党员的工作进行实际的监督。
    由于火星派的分裂，大会表决党章第一项时以多数票通过了马尔托夫机会主义的条文。
    大会工作结束时，俄国社会民主工党分裂为两派。拥护列宁的人，即真正革命的马克思主义者在选举党中央机关时获得了多数选票而开始被称呼为布尔什维克，反对他们的人获得了少数选票而被称呼为孟什维克。
    代表大会巩固了马克思主义对“经济派”的胜利。大会通过了党纲党章之后，建立了社会民主党并使统一的政党初具规模。但是大会在组织问题上没能胜任，因为它没有彻底揭穿和粉碎孟什维克在组织问题上的机会主义立场。
    代表大会闭会后，党内革命派和机会主义者的斗争更加激烈了。机会主义者要把党拉向后退，引向组织上的涣散、小组习气和手工业方式。他们进行猖獗的宣传来反对党性思想和党内纪律。在革命行将来临的条件下，这种宣传就是要使工人阶级脱离政治领导，从而扑灭革命。
    拥护列宁的人粉碎了孟什维克在组织问题上的机会主义立场，反对小组习气而捍卫了党性，反对了捣乱派而捍卫了党。
    列宁在“进一步，退两步”一书中对第二次代表大会作了总结，并对党内革命派与机会主义的斗争给予了深刻的分析。在这一著作中制定了马克思主义政党的组织基础。
    列宁教导说，共产党是工人阶级先进的、马克思主义的、有组织的部队，是工人阶级一切组织的最高形式。党是工人阶级先进部队与工人阶级千百万群众联系的体现。党必须按集中制原则组织起来，并要有统一的党章、统一的党的纪律和统一的领导核心。党要保持自己队伍的统一就要实行统一的无产阶级纪律，即全体党员——无论是领导者或普通党员——都必须同样遵守的纪律。
    列宁在马克思主义历史上第一次地阐明了关于党的学说，说明党是无产阶级的领导组织，是无产阶级手中的主要武器，没有这个武器便无法在社会主义革命中取得胜利。
    列宁所制定的党内生活准则和党的领导原则，是党内工作的基本原则。它们的生命活力已为苏联共产党的全部光荣历史所验证过了。
    自从党成立以后已经过了半个世纪了，在这一时期里，党在为工人阶级的事业的斗争中获得了最伟大的全世界历史意义的胜利。党在这段期间内经历了长远光荣的途程，从最初的马克思主义小组和团体，发展成了现在领导着强大的工农社会主义国家并引导着苏联人民从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的伟大的共产党。
    在数十年期间内，俄国的劳动人民实际考验了在俄国存在过的一切主要的政党：立宪民主党，孟什维克，社会革命党，共产党。国内各民族在革命事变发展进程中抛弃了一切资产阶级政党而拥护共产党，认为共产党是代表他们的根本利益的唯一的政党。共产党是广大人民群众自己的亲近的政党。苏联共产党在半世纪中以自己忠实的服务赢得了人民的热爱和信任。
    党的五十年的历史的经验证明：与群众的联系是党的不可战胜性和党的领导的基础。如果党代表着人民群众的根本利益，在自己的活动中依靠群众，党就是不可战胜的。
    半世纪的历史教导我们：共产党是思想一致的共产主义者的战斗联盟，没有革命的理论，没有科学的社会主义与工人运动的结合，无产阶级就只能在黑暗中摸索。共产党的力量就在于：它是用社会发展和政治斗争的规律的知识，用关于自然和社会的发展规律的科学、关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学、关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，关于共产主义社会建设的科学武装起来的。马克思列宁主义理论反映着社会物质生活发展业经成熟的需要，反映着劳动群众的利益。
    马克思列宁主义理论是永远生气蓬勃的、发展着的、创造性的科学，它和教条主义是不同的。它不断由适应于新的历史环境的新的经验、新的知识、新的总结和结论所丰富起来。
    共产党在其为工人阶级的事业而进行的斗争中之所以获得了并正在获得着胜利，是因为它过去和现在都在以最大的坚定性和彻底性卫护着自己队伍的统一。这种统一是在革命的政策的基础上，在为列宁主义思想而进行的原则的斗争的基础上得到保证的。党的钢铁般的统一，是党的力量和不可战胜性的源泉。
    苏联共产党的最伟大的力量就在于：它经常勇敢地和坚决地揭发自己工作中的缺点，在开展批评和自我批评中汲取新的力量而进一步为争取共产主义的胜利而斗争。
    在社会主义胜利和逐步向共产主义过渡的条件下，批评和自我批评获得了特殊的意义。批评和自我批评是发展的真正动力，是共产党手中用以克服工作缺点和教育干部的强大工具。批评和自我批评是一个强有力的工具，党借助它可以消灭苏联社会生活中的不良现象和肃清人们意识中的资本主义残余。
    从分析党的半世纪历史所得出的最重要的结论是：党的政策是正确无误的。共产党的政策是从劳动者的根本利益出发和以客观存在的社会发展法则为依据的。
    由于自己的英明的革命政策，由于为实现这些政策而进行的忘我的斗争，党在为工人阶级的事业的斗争中取得了具有全世界历史意义的成就。
    党曾经领导了俄国工人阶级反对沙皇主义和资本主义的英勇的解放斗争，以自己的鼓舞的和组织的活动保证了伟大的十月革命的胜利。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下以最大的热情创建了新的社会主义工业，建立起用头等机器技术武装起来的集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站，在苏联国内实现了文化革命。由于社会主义的胜利，在苏联消灭了人剥削人的现象。在列宁—斯大林的民族政策的指导下，共产党把俄国各民族从许多世纪以来的社会的和民族的压迫中解放出来，克服了从前各被压迫民族在经济上和文化上的落后性，把居住在俄国的一切民族团结在一个苏联各民族的兄弟家庭中。党是苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中取得光荣的历史性的胜利的鼓舞者和组织者，现在正胜利地领导着共产主义的建设。
    规定了党在当前阶段的主要任务的第十九次党代表大会，是争取共产主义斗争中的伟大路标，当前的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，不断提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟般联系的精神来教育社会成员，竭力加强苏维埃祖国的积极防御以防止敌人的侵略行动。
    不久前召开的苏联共产党中央委员会七月全会特别有力地表明了伟大的苏联共产党的不可摧毁的统
    一，表明了它完成现在摆在苏联面前的对内政策和对外政策方面的历史任务的战斗准备。
    党的政策经过为争取劳动者的利益而斗争的数十年的检验和考验，它享有苏联国内人民群众的无穷的信任和积极的拥护，共产党和苏联政府在国内政策方面的主要关怀是：最大限度地满足苏联人民不断增长的物质和文化需要。党动员苏联人民的创造力量去为苏联的进一步繁荣、为争取社会主义工业和农业的新的成就而斗争。党依据于经济法则而利用社会主义制度的伟大优越性，以加速苏联社会循着共产主义的道路前进。
    共产党的政策的目的在于进一步巩固工人和集体农庄庄员的联盟和加强苏联各民族的友谊和统一。党以无产阶级国际主义精神教育群众，坚决地和不调和地为反对任何资产阶级民族主义的表现而斗争。
    党正在更加广泛和积极地开展对群众的共产主义教育。共产党集中注意于发展群众的社会义务感与对劳动和公共财产的共产主义态度，党以苏维埃爱国主义和各民族友好的精神教育人民。
    党在开展思想工作时是从以下一原则出发的：只有以马克思列宁主义理论的科学原理为基础的党中央委员会的集体政治经验和集体智慧，才能保证党和国家的正确领导，保证党队伍的不可动摇的团结一致，保证在苏联胜利地建设共产主义。
    在我国，党和国家的领导的最高原则是它的集体性、团结性和一致性。马克思列宁主义教导我们，最严格地遵守集体性的原则，是正确领导国家的保证，是苏维埃国家向共产主义前进的最重要条件。
    党经常领导着我国国家机关和社会机关的工作。党遵循着列宁斯大林的国家学说，不断地巩固苏维埃国家，提高苏联人民在对内外敌人的斗争中的警惕性。
    共产党在对外政策方面的主要关怀是：为反对准备和发动新战争而进行坚决和彻底的斗争，为保持和巩固和平而斗争。党把保护和巩固各民族的最伟大的胜利成果——和平、民主和社会主义阵营，把不断加强苏联人民和其他国家劳动人民的友好联系，以及加强同伟大的中国人民与一切人民民主国家劳动者的永久的和不可破坏的友谊，看作自己的义务。

    半世纪以前举行的第二次党代表大会，是俄国和国际工人运动发展中的转折点。以伟大的列宁为首的俄国工人阶级的先进力量，开辟了历史的新道路，树立了为争取工人阶级的革命政党而斗争的榜样。在过去的半世纪中，党积累了在革命各个阶段上的斗争的最丰富的经验，这一经验和马克思列宁主义的伟大思想，给外国劳动群众照亮着为争取社会主义和民主、争取各民族的自由和平等、争取各民族的持久和平和兄弟般的互助而斗争的可靠的道路。　（凡静译）
