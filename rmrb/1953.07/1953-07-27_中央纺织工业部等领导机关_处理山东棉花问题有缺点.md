    Central Textile Industry Ministry and other Leading Organs
    Have Shortcomings in Handling Shandong Cotton Issues
    Ding Jianlu of the Planning Department of the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau writes: The raw cotton needed by our bureau's factories is supplied by the Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. Starting in December of last year, this company actually transported raw cotton with a moisture content of more than 12% to Qingdao. According to central regulations, this kind of raw cotton is not allowed to be shipped or traded. After our bureau discovered this problem, we requested the Qingdao Municipal Finance and Economics Committee to resolve it. The Municipal Finance and Economics Committee convened a meeting between the two parties in January of this year. In order to take care of the company's difficulties and avoid waste, it was decided that the cotton already shipped would be accepted by our bureau and used as much as possible in combination with other cotton; the company would bear the cost of drying any cotton that could not be used in combination; and this kind of cotton would be resolutely prohibited from being shipped in the future. However, the company did not implement this resolution and continued to ship large quantities of this raw cotton afterwards. We repeatedly raised objections, but to no avail. At the same time, most of these cotton bales contained cotton that had been pulled from stalks or picked from unripe bolls. When we used it in combination with other cotton, it affected the quality of the products. Moreover, the rainy season was approaching, and although this cotton was being dried, it was still very susceptible to mildew. We reported these circumstances to the Central Textile Industry Ministry and the Qingdao Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, requesting them to handle the matter. The Municipal Finance and Economics Committee convened another meeting and decided on March 26: raw cotton with a moisture content of more than 13% would be transported back to the production area by the company to be unpacked and dried; cotton with a moisture content of 12% to 13% would still be used by our bureau as much as possible under the principle of not affecting product output and quality; in order to prevent the cotton from becoming mildewed and deteriorated, active drying work should be carried out, with the costs borne by the company. Based on the situation at the time, this decision was reasonable. Our bureau actively prepared to implement this decision.
    However, on March 28, our bureau received instructions from the Central Textile Industry Ministry, stating that the cotton already shipped to Qingdao should be handled by our bureau with emergency measures. In addition to frequent turning of the stacks, the cotton with a higher moisture content should be used as soon as possible (cotton with a moisture content of more than 14% should be taken away by the local company for processing). The Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company would be responsible for the losses suffered by the factory due to the use of this cotton after consultation. On April 1, they also forwarded instructions from the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, stipulating that the cotton with a moisture content of 13% to 14% should be used up by our bureau's factories within two months, during which time the Shandong Provincial Company would be responsible for any mildew. Our bureau would be entirely responsible for the cotton with a moisture content of 12% to 13%.
    I believe that the Central Textile Industry Ministry and the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company both have shortcomings in their handling of this issue. They both emphasized that our bureau should use the cotton with a higher moisture content first, but they did not mention the issue of product output and quality. Of course, since the problem has occurred, our bureau should use it as much as possible, but at the same time, we must pay attention to not affecting output and quality. According to the trial spinning results of the state-owned Qingdao No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory using this cotton, the black spots, neps, and impurities in the products increased by 60% to 90%; the strength decreased by 14.3%; and the breakage rate increased by 20% to 25%. In short, both output and quality were affected as a result. Although the Central Textile Industry Ministry's instructions stated that the losses incurred from using this cotton could be negotiated and borne by the Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, how would the Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company be responsible for the losses in output and quality? Even if the company bought back these poor-quality products, wouldn't the people still suffer the loss? The China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company said that the cotton with a moisture content of 13% to 14% should be used up by our bureau within two months, during which time the Shandong Provincial Company would be responsible for any mildew. Leaving aside whether our bureau can use up this cotton within two months, why not try to prevent mildew since this cotton may become mildewed? Isn't it a loss to the people if the Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company is responsible for it after it becomes mildewed? The above situation shows that the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company lacks an overall plan and the idea of serving production in the entire raw cotton supply issue. The Central Textile Industry Ministry's echoing of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company's approach also shows a lack of understanding of the importance of guaranteeing production. I hope they will re-examine this issue and earnestly improve the future raw cotton supply work.

### 中央纺织工业部等领导机关  处理山东棉花问题有缺点

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中央纺织工业部等领导机关
    处理山东棉花问题有缺点
    青岛纺织管理局计划处丁建洛来信：我局所属各厂需用的原棉，是由山东省花纱布公司供给的。去年十二月份开始，该公司竟把含水百分之十二以上的原棉运到青岛。这种原棉，根据中央的规定，是不准起运、不准买卖的。我局发现这个问题后，就提请青岛市财经委员会解决。市财委在今年一月召集双方开会，为了照顾该公司的困难和避免浪费，决定把已运来的棉花由我局收下，尽量搭配使用；无法搭用而需要翻晒的，费用由该公司负担；今后这种棉花坚决禁止起运。但是，该公司并没有执行这个决议，以后继续大量运来这种原棉。我们多次提出意见，仍无效果。同时，这些棉花大部夹有拔秆剥桃棉，我们搭用时就影响产品质量；且霉季将到，这些棉花虽在进行翻晒，但还是很容易霉烂。我们就把这些情况报告中央纺织工业部及青岛市财委，请求处理。市财委又召集会议，在三月二十六日决定：含水量百分之十三以上的原棉由公司运回产区拆包翻晒；百分之十二至十三者仍由我局设法在不影响产品产量与质量的原则下尽量搭配使用；为了防止棉花霉烂变质，应积极进行翻晒工作，费用由公司负担。根据当时情况来看，这个决定是合理的。我局就积极准备执行这一决定。
    但是，三月二十八日，我局接到中央纺织工业部的指示，说是已运青岛的这些棉花应由我局采取紧急措施处理，除应经常进行翻垛外，并尽量将含水分较大的棉花设法先行使用（含水百分之十四以上的棉花应由当地公司取去处理）。工厂因使用这些棉花而遭受之损失经协商后由山东省花纱布公司负责。四月一日，他们又转来中国花纱布公司的指示，规定含水量在百分之十三至十四的棉花要我局各厂在两个月内用掉，在此期间霉烂由山东省公司负担。含水百分之十二至十三的棉花则完全要我局负责。
    我认为中央纺织工业部与中国花纱布公司对这一问题的处理都是有缺点的。他们都强调要我局将含水量较大的棉花先行搭配使用，但是对产品产量与质量问题却一字不提。当然问题既然发生了，我局应尽量搭用，但是同时要注意不影响产量与质量。根据国营青岛第七棉纺织厂搭用这种棉花试纺结果，产品的黑点、棉结、杂质增加百分之六十到九十几；强力降低百分之十四点三；断头率增加百分之二十至二十五；总之，产量、质量都因此而受到影响。中央纺织工业部指示中虽然说因使用这种棉花而受的损失可协商由山东省花纱布公司负责；但产量和质量的损失山东省花纱布公司怎样负责呢？即使该公司把这些品质坏的产品收购下来，结果还不是人民受损失吗？中国花纱布公司说，含水百分之十三至十四的棉花要我局在两个月内用完，在此期间霉烂由山东省花纱布公司负责。先不说这些棉花我局能否在两个月内用掉；既然这种棉花可能霉烂，为什么不去设法防止呢？霉烂后由山东省花纱布公司负责难道不是人民的损失吗？以上情况说明花纱布公司在整个原棉供应问题上缺乏通盘计划和为生产服务的思想。中央纺织工业部对花纱布公司这种做法随声附和，也是对保证生产问题认识不足的。希望他们重新研究这个问题，并切实改进今后的原棉供应工作。
