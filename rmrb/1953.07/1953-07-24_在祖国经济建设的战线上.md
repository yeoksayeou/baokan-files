Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 14 Fully Supports the Construction of Anshan Iron and Steel

The Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 14, under the Electrical Industry Bureau of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building, completed the task of manufacturing electrical components for the seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company on schedule. For this, Anshan Iron and Steel Company sent a letter to the employees of Electrical Engineering Plant No. 14 to express their gratitude. This batch of orders included 44 types of components, such as control panels, nickel-chromium wire resistor boxes, and cast iron resistor boxes, totaling over 630 pieces. After accepting this order, they encountered many difficulties: the types of parts were numerous, they had never manufactured them before, some of the required materials were not immediately available, and they had to deliver the goods quickly, with the contract signed on June 3rd and delivery required by June 30th. After receiving the task, the leading cadres of Electrical Engineering Plant No. 14 held various meetings to study ways to complete it. Thanks to the attention of the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and the full mobilization of the masses, this batch of goods was successfully completed on June 30th. These components have now been transported to Anshan, and inspection has proved that the quality is fully up to standard and has been sent to the site for installation, ensuring the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel.

Eight Factories Under the East China Iron and Steel Company
Overfulfilled Production Tasks for the First Half of the Year

The main products of eight factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company, including Shanghai Iron and Steel Plants No. 1, 2, and 3, and Xinhua and Asia, have all overfulfilled the production tasks for the first half of the year. Among them, steelmaking averaged 106.49 percent completion, and steel rolling completed 107.32 percent. The main products of most factories have comprehensively completed and exceeded quality indicators. Labor productivity totaled 108.6 percent completion.

The main reason why the factories were able to complete the plan was because they strengthened planning management and improved and established relatively substantial work plans. For example, Xinhua Iron and Steel Plant established a production dispatching organization to supervise and inspect the implementation of work plans, ensuring the completion of production tasks.

Dali Farm in Shaanxi Improves Technology
Winter Wheat Achieves a Bumper Harvest

Dali Farm, a local state-owned farm in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, achieved a bumper harvest of winter wheat last year by using new-style agricultural tools and adopting close planting methods. As early as 1951, the farm borrowed money to purchase eight new-style walking plows. At that time, the agricultural workers thought that "the old plows were easier to use," and the farm's leading cadres did not seriously educate and break the workers' conservative ideas. Therefore, the new-style walking plows also became "idle plows" on the farm. Last spring, in the patriotic production increase competition movement, the farm's leading cadres realized the importance of using new-style agricultural tools to improve farming techniques and increase yields, and mobilized all workers to use them. At the same time, the farm director also conducted careful research with Li Hengchang, an activist and production team leader, came up with a method, and conducted field trials. When plowing the wheat fields last summer, the farm workers began to use new-style walking plows for cultivation. When sowing winter wheat in the autumn, the farm director again mobilized the workers to adopt narrow-row, evenly spaced close sowing, so that the number of sowing rows per mu increased by 60 percent compared with previous years, and the sowing amount also increased. After these technical reforms, all the more than 320 mu of winter wheat sown on the farm this year achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 300 jin of wheat per mu, more than twice as much as local farmers. Among them, 15.6 mu of high-yield fields harvested as much as 7,988 jin of wheat, with an average yield of more than 512 jin per mu. (Zhang Jie)

Preparatory Work for Basic Construction in the Bailong River Forest Area in Southern Gansu is Underway

Xinhua News Agency: The preparatory work for basic construction in the Bailong River Forest Area in southern Gansu Province is actively underway. The reconnaissance work for the forest railway line has already begun. The reconnaissance team set off from Liangshui Town (belonging to Wudu County) along the Bailong River in mid-June to conduct reconnaissance towards Wushan County. In order to facilitate the flow of timber, preparations are being stepped up for the blasting of stone reefs in the river channels of the Bailong River and Gongba River (a tributary of the Bailong River). This project is expected to officially start in late July. A large forest management survey team composed of more than 120 people will also depart at the end of July. Construction projects such as forest farm houses are expected to begin in mid-August.

The Bailong River Forest Area in southern Gansu is a virgin forest, mostly of spruce, fir and other tree species, and the timber quality is very high. This area is mostly inhabited by Tibetan people. The development of this forest area will greatly benefit the support of the country's various constructions, improve the economic life of the Tibetan people, and promote the development of various social undertakings in the area.

Xinhua News Agency: The Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station of China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is processing many new, large-patterned, dark-colored floral fabrics to meet the needs of the working people after the autumn. These floral fabrics, designed with patterns that are popular among the people, have been sold all over the country and have been welcomed by consumers. The most popular pattern in various regions is currently "Peacock Spreading its Tail." This fabric is printed with lifelike peacocks spreading their beautiful tail feathers on base colors such as dark red, purplish-red, dark blue, and dark green. Currently, 54,000 bolts of "Peacock Spreading its Tail" fabric have been sold, and it still cannot meet the needs of various regions. Xi'an and Xinjiang have each received 4,000 bolts and are requesting an additional 5,000 bolts. The Beijing Company of China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has sold 400 bolts and has sent a letter requesting another 1,500 bolts. "Hundred Children" is another new, dark-colored floral fabric that is widely welcomed. This floral fabric is designed and printed based on patterns from folk picture books and New Year pictures, with various lively and innocent children printed on various dark-colored fabrics, some playing gongs and drums, some playing ball beside bamboo fences, some setting off firecrackers, and some playing with goldfish, the patterns are very beautiful. In addition, lion flower baskets, peacock peony, phoenix, sparrow plum, and pine crane patterns have also been issued. These new dark-colored floral fabrics all have folk characteristics and are most popular among farmers in various regions. They are all sold out as soon as they leave the factory.

The peak season for sales of dark-colored floral fabrics is approaching. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station is mobilizing various factories to design more new dark-colored floral fabrics, including many small-patterned and medium-patterned dark-colored floral fabrics. A "Rural Happiness" dark-colored large-patterned floral fabric pattern with the theme of new rural life is being designed and will be processed and supplied soon.

Zhejiang Silk Company Improves Silk and Satin Products

Xinhua News Agency: The Zhejiang Provincial Company of China Silk Company is actively improving silk and satin products to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. In order to expand "domestic sales," 70 percent of Zhejiang's silk this year is being woven with native silk. These native silk fabrics, such as plain big silk (i.e., Hangzhou silk), floral big silk (i.e., thread spring), and mass crepe, are not only cheap but also very beautiful and are welcomed by people from all over the country. Recently, two sales teams from the company have been selling along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Zhejiang-Fujian lines. In just one month, they sold various silks and satins worth 1.7 billion yuan, of which about 80 percent will be sold to rural areas. State-owned department stores and cooperatives in Northeast, North, and Northwest China have also successively sent order forms. The "Rejuvenation Fabric" and "Improved Fabric" ordered by department stores in Shenyang and Harbin alone amounted to 4,500 bolts. In addition, "brocade satin," "georgette," "double crepe," and "heavenly silk," which are famous in foreign markets, are also being continuously improved. Teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts have designed very beautiful patterns with oriental national characteristics for the company. The problem of silk dyeing has also been raised to a very important position for research. After several improvements, light colors such as sky blue, ash gray, clean gray, and blood tooth have approached level three fastness and are generally free from fading.

Hangzhou is a famous "city of silk," with thousands of silk weaving factories and households, producing tens of thousands of bolts of silk and satin every year. These products are finely woven and beautifully colored, and have always been sold well in domestic and foreign markets.

    陕西大荔农场改进技术
    冬小麦获得丰收
    陕西省大荔县地方国营大荔农场，去年使用新式农具和采用密植方法播种的冬小麦获得丰收。该场早在一九五一年就贷购了八部新式步犁，当时农业工人认为“不如旧犁好使”，场的领导干部也没有认真进行教育，打破工人们的保守思想，因此，新式步犁在农场也变成了“挂犁”。去年春天，在爱国增产竞赛运动中，该场领导干部认识到使用新式农具对改进耕作技术和增加产量的重要意义，发动全场工人使用。同时，场长还与积极分子、生产组长李恒昌进行细心的研究，想出了办法，并进行了实地试验。到了去年夏季翻耕麦地时，农场工人就开始使用新式步犁耕作。秋季播种冬小麦时，农场场长又发动工人采用窄行均匀密播，使每亩播种行数比往年增加达百分之六十，播种量也增加了。经过这些技术改革，今年全场播种的三百二十多亩冬小麦，都得到了丰收，平均每亩收小麦三百斤，比当地农民多收一倍以上。其中有十五亩六分丰产田，竟收获小麦达七千九百八十八斤，平均每亩收麦五百一十二斤多。（张杰）
    甘肃南部白龙江林区基本建设的准备工作正在进行
    甘肃省南部白龙江林区基本建设的准备工作，正在积极进行中。森林铁道线路的踏勘工作已经开始。踏勘队在六月中旬从白龙江沿岸的两水镇（属武都县）出发向武山县踏勘。为了便利木材流送，正在加紧进行白龙江、拱坝河（白龙江支流）河道中石礁爆炸工程的准备工作。这一工程估计七月下旬可正式开工。还有一百二十多人组成的大型森林经理调查队也将在七月底出发。森林场房等建筑工程预计八月中旬可以动工。
    甘肃南部白龙江林区为原始森林，大多数都是云杉、冷杉等树种，木材质量很高。这里多半都是藏族人民聚居地区，这一林区的开发，对支援祖国各项建设，改善藏族人民的经济生活，促进当地各种社会事业的发展都有很大好处。（新华社）
