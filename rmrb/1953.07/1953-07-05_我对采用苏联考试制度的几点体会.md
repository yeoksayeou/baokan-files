    My Thoughts on Adopting the Soviet Examination System
    Wang Guangyuan, Deputy Director of the Architectural Mechanics Teaching and Research Section, Harbin Institute of Technology
    Examination is a continuation of the teaching process and an inseparable part of teaching work. Its purpose, on the one hand, is to allow students to consolidate what they have learned throughout the semester and make a comprehensive summary and review. On the other hand, it is to check the students' learning progress in the semester, discover the problems that exist in the students' learning and the teachers and teaching and research sections' work, so as to improve. Therefore, this is a very important task. Here, I would like to write about my experience under the guidance of Soviet experts, in the examination process of several courses in our teaching and research section, regarding the advantages of the Soviet examination system.
    First, examination is not simply to check teaching results, but to consolidate and develop them. According to the old examination system, examinations were conducted two days after classes were stopped, with two or three subjects examined each day, and could be completed in three days. But in such a short period of time, students simply could not review, let alone deeply understand and comprehensively summarize the courses they have learned. At the same time, teachers could not provide effective help to students. Therefore, some students adopted a "passing-the-test" attitude to cope with it, while more serious students had to start reviewing before the end of classes. However, because the past teaching lacked planning, teachers often had to rush through the syllabus before the end of the semester. Therefore, at this time, students had to learn a lot of new things while also reviewing old lessons. It is not difficult to imagine the predicament students were in and how difficult it was for them to accept the later part of the teaching material under such circumstances. Therefore, the old examination system not only failed to consolidate students' learning achievements, but also directly affected the quality of the later courses.
    But the Soviet examination system is completely different. According to the Soviet examination system, the school should formulate an examination schedule one month before the examination, with reference to the opinions put forward by the students. At the same time, when arranging the schedule, students must be given three to five days of review time for each subject. During this period, students should, with the help of teachers and the teaching and research section, conduct a serious review and summary of the subject. Generally speaking, in addition to making a comprehensive summary of all the courses learned in the semester at the end of the course, the teacher should also conduct two collective question-and-answer sessions, as well as individual question-and-answer sessions. The first collective question-and-answer session should be held one or two days after the students have reviewed the subject, because at this time, after preliminary review, some common problems will be discovered. When answering questions, teachers can adopt a lecture method or a classroom discussion method, in order to enable students to understand these problems more deeply. The second collective question-and-answer session is held the day before the examination in order to solve the problems that continue to be discovered. If a second collective question-and-answer session is not needed, it can be omitted. As for the teaching and research section, it should always understand the students' ideological situation during the examination period, promptly mobilize them, and provide guidance on review methods. Secondly, even during the oral examination, a teacher should not miss any opportunity to enable students to further understand the learning content they have not yet mastered. After such an examination, students can not only understand the learning content they failed to fully master in the learning process, but also comprehensively and systematically understand the entire course and consolidate the knowledge they have learned.
    In addition, for teachers and teaching and research sections, through question-and-answer sessions and examinations, they will not only understand the students' learning situation, but also inevitably discover some shortcomings in their teaching work through the examination. This creates favorable conditions for improving teaching work.
    Second, the Soviet examination system can comprehensively and deeply check students' achievements. According to the old examination system, teachers often only had contact with students on test papers, and the scope of the questions was often narrow. In this way, it was not only difficult to comprehensively check students' achievements, but it was also easy to cultivate students' mentality of speculation (such as guessing questions). Therefore, although the old score calculation could be accurate to the second decimal place, it could not truly reflect students' achievements.
    The Soviet examination system is completely different. During the examination, students enter the examination room in the order arranged by the class monitor. The number of students in the first batch is about three times the number of teachers participating in the examination (teaching assistants can also help with the examination if necessary), and the total number of people in the examination room generally does not exceed ten. People who are not directly related to the examination are not allowed to enter the examination room unless they have the permission of the principal. During the examination, students leave and enter the examination room in order until the entire class has finished the examination. After entering the examination room, students first hand in their grade records, draw examination slips (test questions), collect test papers, and sit in designated places to prepare. The preparation time does not exceed one hour. After the preparation is completed, they go to the teacher to take the examination. During the oral examination, students first defend their problem-solving methods and results to the teacher, and then the teacher conducts more extensive inquiries. The scope of the questions is very wide. If the student's answer is incorrect, the teacher will enlighten the student from various aspects in order to see the actual extent of the student's understanding of the problem. Finally, if the student really cannot answer, the teacher can order him to study after the examination or give specific help to the students after the examination. The oral examination also has another advantage, that is, because its form is more flexible, it can learn more about students' views on certain issues and the degree of proficiency in problem-solving. The oral examination time is about half an hour. After the oral examination is completed, the student's score is immediately filled in the grade registration form issued to the teacher by the department, and filled in the student's own grade record. If a student receives a passing grade but is not satisfied with his score, he can, with the approval of the principal, make an appointment with the original examiner at another time (during this examination period) to retake the examination. In short, it is necessary to ensure that students can get fair and reasonable scores. In this way, after the examination, students truly understand the problems that exist in their studies. Therefore, after the examination, many students often make specific plans to make up for their lessons.
    Third, the flexibility of the Soviet examination system. Because the nature of each course in the university is different, the examination methods and content are also diverse. For example, our "Elasticity and Plasticity Mechanics" only has oral examinations, and because this course has a relatively large theoretical component, the content of the examination focuses on students' understanding of theoretical aspects. At the same time, because many formulas in this course are relatively complex, difficult to remember, and there is no need to memorize them, students are allowed to read books or notes in the examination room when they prepare for the oral examination. This avoids the tendency of students to neglect theoretical understanding because of rote memorization of formulas, and eliminates unnecessary difficulties for students. Experience tells us that this examination method is very suitable. It will not allow lazy students to get a better score than they deserve, because when they do not have a good understanding of the theory, books or notes cannot help them answer the questions raised by the teacher well.
    But this is not the case for other courses, such as "Structural Mechanics" and "Material Mechanics." For these courses, students are strictly prohibited from carrying books or notes into the examination room. At the same time, because these courses focus on calculation, there is only one theoretical question and two calculation questions on each examination slip. If the student does not know how to calculate the questions at all, then even if he answers the theoretical questions very well, he will fail. In addition, because students should complete a series of homework assignments during the learning process of these courses, and "Material Mechanics" also has experiments, in addition to examinations, there are also quizzes for these courses. The quiz is when students should answer questions in front of the teacher in a timely manner after completing the homework or experiment. The content is only about these homework or experiment questions, and does not include theoretical questions. The purpose of the quiz is to check the degree of students' mastery of homework and experiments. The quiz only has the distinction between pass and fail, and is not graded. The quiz must be completed before the examination. Students who have not passed the quiz have no right to participate in the examination.
    In addition, some lower-grade courses, such as physics, mathematics, and "Theoretical Mechanics," have regular checks in addition to examinations and quizzes. The number of times and dates are approved by the department director at the beginning of the semester. The purpose is only to check students' regular and systematic learning at this stage and to encourage this systematic learning. For "Material Mechanics," this regular check can be carried out or not.
    The flexibility of the Soviet examination system is also reflected in another aspect, that is, each teacher is more flexible in handling examination problems. For example, at first we were surprised to see our Soviet advisor in the teaching and research section tell the students all the theoretical questions on the examination slips he had formulated directly in the classroom at the end of the course (calculation questions are absolutely kept secret). After the Soviet advisor's explanation, and several years of practical teaching experience told us: this is beneficial and harmless. Because these theoretical questions include all the content taught throughout the semester (this is very important), we are not afraid of students knowing, on the contrary, we hope that they are familiar with these questions and prepare as if he must draw these questions. In this way, students summarize each important question and leave a deep impression in their minds, more firmly and systematically mastering the entire course.
    Finally, it should be explained that the smooth progress and success of the examination, like other work, is inseparable from the correct leadership of the school administration, the Party, the League, the trade union, and the close cooperation of the student union.

    我对采用苏联考试制度的几点体会
    哈尔滨工业大学建筑力学教研室副主任  王光远
    考试是教学过程的继续，是教学工作不可分割的组成部分，它的目的，一方面是让学生把整个学期所学习的东西加以巩固，作一次全面的总结和复习；另一方面是检查一下学生一学期来的学习情况，发现学生在学习中和教师及教研室在工作中所存在的问题，以便改进。因此这是一件非常重要的工作。这里，我想写一写我在苏联专家指导下，在本教研室的几门课程的考试过程中对苏联考试制度优越性的几点体会。
    第一、考试不是单纯地检查教学成绩，而且是为了巩固和发扬它。按照旧的考试制度，在停课后两天便进行考试，每天考两三门，三天便可结束。但在这样短的时间中，学生根本无法进行复习，更谈不到深入了解和全面总结所学课程了。同时教师也无法对学生进行有效的帮助。因此有些学生便采取过关的态度，应付一下，而比较认真的学生，便不得不在停课之前就开始复习。但是又因为过去教学缺乏计划，学期结束前教师往往要赶功课，因而，在这时，学生一方面必须学习大量的新东西，同时又必须复习旧课；不难设想，在这种情况下，学生所处的窘境和学生对后面一部分教材接受的程度该是怎样的困难了。所以旧的考试制度不仅不能巩固学生的学习成绩，而且直接影响着后面所学功课的质量。
    但苏联的考试制度完全不是这样的。按照苏联的考试制度，在考试前一个月，学校便应参考学生所提出的意见，订出考试日程表；同时，在排定日程表时，又必须使学生对每一门功课有三天到五天的复习时间。在此期间，学生应在教师及教研室的帮助下，对该门功课进行认真的复习和总结。一般地说，教师除在功课结束时应对全学期所学课程进行全面总结外，还应作两次集体答疑，以及个别答疑。第一次集体答疑要在学生对该门功课复习一两天后举行，因为这时经过初步复习，将会发现一些共同存在的问题。教师解答问题时，可以采取讲解的方式，也可以采用课堂讨论的方式，总之要使学生更深入地认识这些问题。第二次的集体答疑是在考试的前一天举行，以便解决继续发现的问题。如果不需要第二次集体答疑，也可以不举行。至于教研室，则应随时了解在考试期中学生的思想情况，及时进行动员，并应在复习的方法上给以指导。其次，即使在口试的时候，一个教师也不应当放过任何一个机会，使学生对其尚未掌握的学习内容得到进一步的了解。经过这样的考试，学生不仅能够了解在学习过程中未能完全掌握的学习内容，而且也可以全面地、系统地认识全部课程，巩固自己所学到的知识。
    此外，对教师和教研室来说，经过答疑和考试，不仅会了解到学生的学习情况，同时，也必然会通过考试，发现自己在教学工作上的一些缺点。这样，便给改进教学工作创造了有利的条件。
    第二、苏联的考试制度能全面深入地检查学生的成绩。按照旧的考试制度，教师往往只能在试卷上和学生接触，题目的范围也往往是窄狭的，如此，便不但很难全面检查学生的成绩，而且也容易养成学生投机取巧（如猜题目等）的心理。所以，旧的分数计算虽然可以精确到小数点以后第二位，但它并不能真正反映学生的成绩。
    苏联的考试制度完全不是这样的。考试时，学生按照班长预先排好的次序入场，第一批入场人数约为参加考试教师（如果需要的话，助教也可以帮助进行考试）人数的三倍，而考场上总人数一般不超过十人，和考试无直接关系的人，除得到校长许可外，是不得进入考场的。考试进行中，学生是依照次序出场、入场，直到全班考完。学生在进入考场后，首先交出自己的成绩纪录册，抽取考签（试题），领取试卷，坐在指定的地方进行准备。准备时间不超过一小时，准备完毕后便到教师处去进行考试。口试时，学生首先向教师答辩自己解题的方法和结果，然后教师再进行更广泛的询问。问题范围很广，如学生回答不对时，教师便从各方面来启发学生，以便能看出学生对该问题了解的实际程度如何。最后，如果学生实在回答不出，教师可以令其在考试后进行钻研或在考试后给同学以具体帮助。口试还有另外一个好处，就是因为他的形式比较灵活，因而可以更多地了解学生对某些问题的见解，以及解题的熟练程度。口试时间约为半小时。口试完毕后，即将学生所得成绩当面填入系里发给教师的成绩登记表上，并填在学生自己的成绩纪录册上。如果学生得到及格的分数，但对自己的分数并不满意，则可在得到校长的批准后，再和原考试教师约定时间（在本考期中），另行重考。总之，务使学生能得到公平合理的分数。这样，经过考试，学生就真正了解了自己在学习上存在的问题；所以，在考试后常常有很多学生订出了自己补习功课的具体计划。
    第三、苏联考试制度的灵活性。由于大学中各门功课的性质不同，所以考试的方式和内容也是多种多样的。譬如，我们的“弹性力学及塑性力学”，便只有口试，而且，因为这门功课理论的成分比较大，所以检查内容便偏重于学生对理论方面的了解。同时又因为这门功课的许多公式比较复杂，难于记忆，也没有记忆的必要，所以在考场上当学生准备口试的时候，他们是可以看书或看笔记的。这样便避免了学生们因强记公式反而疏忽理论了解的偏向，并且消除了学生们不必要的困难。经验告诉我们，这样的考试方式很适宜，它并不会使偷懒的学生得到比他应得的更好的分数，因为当他对理论没有很好的了解时，书本或笔记并不能帮助他很好地回答教师所提出的问题。
    但对其他课程，如“结构力学”和“材料力学”等，便不是这样。对于这些课程，绝对禁止学生携带书籍或笔记进入试场。同时由于这些课程偏重于计算，所以在每个考签上只有一个理论题目，而有两个计算题目。如果学生根本不会计算题目，那么即使他的理论题目答得很好，也是不及格的。此外，由于这些课程在学习过程中，学生应该完成一系列的家庭作业，而且“材料力学”还有实验，所以对于这些课程除了考试以外，还有测验。测验就是当学生完成作业或实验以后，应及时地在教师面前进行答辩，其内容只是关于这些作业或实验的问题，而不包括理论问题。测验的目的是检查学生对作业及实验掌握的程度。测验只有通过和不通过的区别，不分等级。测验必须在考试前完成。没有通过测验的学生无权参加考试。
    此外，有些低年级的功课如物理、数学及“理论力学”等，除了考试和测验以外，还有平时检查。其次数及日期在学期开始时即经系主任批准，其目的只是检查该阶段学生经常的、有系统的学习，并鼓励这种有系统的学习。对于“材料力学”，可以进行这种平时检查，也可以不进行。
    苏联考试制度的灵活性还表现在另一方面，就是各个教师在处理考试问题的方法上比较灵活。譬如，最初我们看到我们教研室的苏联顾问，在结束功课时便把自己所拟定的考签上所有的理论题目全部直接在课堂上告诉了学生（计算题目是绝对保守秘密的），我们感到很惊奇。经过苏联顾问的解释，和几年来的实际教学经验告诉我们：这样是有百利而无一害的。因为这些理论题目包括了整个学期所讲授的全部内容（这一点非常重要），不但不怕学生知道，相反，正希望他们熟知这些问题，而且准备得就像他一定要抽到这些题目一样。这样，便使学生对每一个重要的问题作了总结，在脑筋里留下深刻的印象，更巩固地、系统地掌握了全部课程。
    最后应该说明，考试的顺利进行和达到成功，也和其他工作一样，是和学校行政、党、团、工会的正确领导和学生会的密切配合分不开的。
