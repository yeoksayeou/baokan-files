    The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, which has unfolded successively throughout the country, has already yielded considerable experience. The experience regarding this struggle, recently summarized by the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at an expanded meeting of cadres at or above the county-level Party secretaries, is among the better ones. According to this summary material, although the development of the struggle in the Shandong region is still very uneven, generally speaking, the style of work of leading organs and leading cadres at all levels has changed. Although this change is preliminary, it is indeed beginning to have relatively significant effects. This situation is, of course, not limited to the Shandong region and can represent the situation in many regions. Facts have proven that as long as the struggle against bureaucracy is carried out in depth, the correct ideology and work methods that are connected to reality and connected to the masses will emerge from all aspects. As many cadres in Shandong said: "The mass line is indeed good; it works smoothly, things are handled smoothly, cadres are satisfied, and the masses are happy." The masses there also reflected: "This year is good in five ways: timely cultivation, good technical research, good wheat growth, good meetings, and good cadre attitude." This can summarize the significant effects of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in practical work.

    The significant achievements of the anti-bureaucracy struggle are undoubtedly due to the correct leadership policy. This policy is one of being active and steady. We must recognize that the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline are serious. "If anything can cause our demise, it is bureaucracy." (Letter from Lenin to the People's Commissariat of Finance, February 22, 1922) Therefore, we must not take a passive attitude towards opposing this bureaucracy that can lead to our demise, and we must actively carry out this struggle. However, as the instructions of our Party Central Committee state, "Bureaucracy and commandism in our Party and government are not only a big problem at present but will continue to be a big problem for a very long time." Therefore, we must not imagine that we can eliminate this bureaucracy, which has long-term social roots, in a short period of time. We must carry it out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    The experience of the Shandong region is that while launching a struggle against bureaucracy that is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, they are vigilantly paying attention to preventing new deviations from arising in this struggle, and at the same time, they are establishing correct ideological work styles and work methods that are connected to reality and connected to the masses in the current leadership of work. This experience is worth paying attention to. In the past, we have conducted several struggles against undesirable tendencies, but some regions have experienced some deviations to varying degrees, which have affected the normal development of the struggle; in individual regions with serious deviations, it has even caused great harm. The Shandong region has deeply absorbed these lessons, and therefore, at the very beginning of this anti-bureaucracy struggle, the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee clearly pointed out: This struggle must be carried out step by step, with a plan and leadership; a realistic and truth-seeking approach must be taken to adopt a differentiated attitude with emphasis, priority, order, and varying degrees of severity according to the different nature and degree of various errors, to prevent serious deviations from occurring. At the same time, it was pointed out that this struggle must be closely integrated with the current work, must focus on criticizing errors and shortcomings that are closely related to the current work, and must use correct ideological work styles and work methods in the leadership of current work to prevent repeating the mistakes of bureaucracy and commandism. This means that we must neither deal with it passively nor advance blindly, but actively lead and advance steadily.

    In the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, the focus should be on opposing bureaucracy and opposing violations of law and discipline, thereby driving the struggle against commandism. This is also the experience summarized by the Shandong Branch. This further highlights the active and steady policy of having focus, steps, and moderation. Facts have proven that the bureaucratic work style of leading organs and leading cadres is an important reason for the commandism of grassroots cadres; and the crimes of violating laws and discipline often find shelter in bureaucracy and go unpunished. Therefore, we must first oppose bureaucracy in leading organs and leading cadres from top to bottom. But at the same time, we must see that the bureaucratic work style in many leading organs and leading cadres is currently linked to the decentralism of acting on one's own, and subjectivism divorced from reality. Therefore, while opposing bureaucracy in leading organs and leading cadres, we must also oppose decentralism and subjectivism. This is what the Shandong region did. They started by strengthening the Party committee system and strengthening the Party's unified leadership, correcting the decentralist phenomenon of acting on one's own; at the same time, they criticized subjectivism divorced from the actual situation of the small-peasant economy, earnestly implemented the idea of taking agricultural production as the overriding task in rural areas, implemented overall planning and unified arrangements, and resolutely overcame the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas; then, they dispatched a large number of responsible cadres to go deep into the grassroots, inspect work, inspect the bureaucracy in leadership from practical work, mobilize the masses and cadres to criticize the bureaucracy in leadership, and bring the correct ideological work style and work methods of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses to the grassroots, specifically helping grassroots cadres to overcome commandism. This was greatly welcomed by grassroots cadres, driving them to consciously carry out the struggle against commandism. Grassroots cadres generally reflected: "The leadership at the higher level has changed!" "If we had known that following the mass line was so good, who would have gone to command?" In this struggle, the broad masses were also mobilized to expose the phenomena of violating laws and discipline, and the more typical bad people and bad deeds that were of educational significance to the broad masses at that time and place were selected and dealt with in a big way. This further encouraged the spirit of criticism from the bottom up, attacked evil, promoted righteousness, and greatly improved the political and ideological level of the broad grassroots cadres.

    In leading this struggle, we must also commend and establish correct ideological work styles and work methods. Actively and appropriately commend good people and good deeds. The instructions given by the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee to various places on March 11 clearly stated: "We must first seize the more prominent typical bad people and bad deeds for handling, in order to attack evil, promote justice, boost morale, and pave the way for the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Then, we must select more typical good people and good deeds for commendation, in order to promote righteousness and set examples." It also pointed out: "Each county in the province must select a typical bad person and bad deed that is enough to serve as a warning and a typical good person and good deed that is enough to be emulated and publish them in the newspaper." They also convened three-level cadre meetings, Party representative meetings, people's representative meetings, and large and small-scale people's letter handling meetings and typical case handling meetings at the county, district, and township levels. At these meetings, bad people and bad deeds were dealt with, good people and good deeds were commended, and criticism and self-criticism combining top-down and bottom-up were carried out, encouraging the broad grassroots cadres to carry out their work with more confidence in accordance with the correct ideological work style. Many Party committees above the county level have also drawn out a number of responsible cadres to go deep into the grassroots for a relatively long period of time, establish work bases, learn from the masses together with grassroots cadres, and help them establish correct ideological work styles and work methods in various tasks. The Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and a number of prefectural and county Party committees have paid attention to using internal circulars and public reports in newspapers to disseminate and promote typical deeds and lessons learned in improving work styles in a timely manner.

    The experience of Shandong proves that the policy for leading the anti-bureaucracy struggle must be active and yet advance steadily. We must oppose these phenomena: calling for the launch of the anti-bureaucracy struggle, but in reality repeatedly postponing this struggle, believing that it will hinder the current work; calling for the launch of criticism and self-criticism, but then flying into a rage at critics; calling for everyone to advance steadily, but once they move, it is "fierce attack and fierce struggle"; calling for caution in treating cadres, but in fact using "caution" as a pretext for liberalism; sending many inspection teams to the grassroots to inspect work, but many inspection teams have in fact become "bureaucratic inspection teams." Under the active and steady policy, bad people and bad deeds must be dealt with seriously; criticism and self-criticism must be vigorously carried out within and outside the Party; good people and good deeds among cadres and the masses must be commended; and correct work styles must be seriously established in current work. At present, in order to better absorb the experiences and lessons of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the recent period, Party committees in various places should imitate Shandong's approach, earnestly summarize this work, adhere to the active and steady policy, in order to continue to implement the anti-bureaucracy struggle.

### 积极而稳步地领导反官僚主义的斗争

    积极而稳步地领导反官僚主义的斗争
    反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，在全国各地先后展开以后，已有不少经验。中共中央山东分局最近召开县委书记以上干部扩大会议所总结的关于这个斗争的经验，就是其中较好的。根据这个总结材料来看，山东地区斗争的发展虽然还很不平衡，但一般说来，各级领导机关和领导干部的作风都有所转变。这一转变虽然是初步的，但确实是已经开始有了比较显著的效果。这种情况当然不只是山东地区的，它可以代表许多地区的情况。事实证明，只要深入进行了反官僚主义的斗争，联系实际和联系群众的正确的思想作风和工作方法就从各方面涌现出来。正如山东的许多干部所说：“到底是群众路线好，一行就通，办事顺当，干部满意，群众欢喜。”又如那里的群众反映：“今年有五好：耕种适时好，技术研究好，小麦长的好，会议开得好，干部态度好。”这就可以概括说明反官僚主义斗争在实际工作中所表现出来的显著成效。
    反官僚主义斗争所以会有这样显著的成效，无疑地是由于领导方针的正确。这个方针就是积极而稳进的方针。我们必须看到官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象是严重的，“如果说有什么东西能够使我们灭亡的话，那就是官僚主义。”（列宁一九二二年二月二十二日给财政人民委员部的信）因而我们对于反对这一足以使我们灭亡的官僚主义，决不能抱消极态度，必须积极地开展这一斗争。但是也正如我们党中央的指示中所说的，“官僚主义和命令主义在我们的党和政府，不但在目前是一个大问题，就是在一个很长的时间内还将是一个大问题。”因而我们对于反对这种具有长期的社会根源的官僚主义，又决不能幻想在短时期内就可以清除，必须有计划有步骤地进行。
    山东地区的经验是一边开展反对脱离实际脱离群众的官僚主义的斗争，并警觉地注意防止在这一斗争中产生新的偏向，一边在当前的工作领导中建立联系实际联系群众的正确的思想作风和工作方法。这个经验是值得重视的。过去我们曾经进行过若干次反对不良倾向的斗争，但有若干地区曾在各种不同程度上发生过一些偏向，影响着斗争的正常开展；在偏向严重的个别地区甚至造成很大的恶果。山东地区深刻地吸取了这种经验教训，因而在这次反官僚主义斗争刚刚开始的时候，中共中央山东分局就明确地指出：对这个斗争必须有步骤有计划有领导地进行；必须实事求是地根据各种错误的不同性质、不同程度而采取有重点、有先后、有轻重的分别对待的态度，防止发生严重的偏差。同时指出这
    一斗争必须密切结合当前工作，必须着重批判与当前工作有密切关系的错误和缺点，必须在当前各项工作的领导中运用正确的思想作风和工作方法，防止重犯官僚主义和命令主义的毛病。这就是说，我们既不可消极应付，也不可盲目冒进，而要积极领导，稳步前进。
    在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争中，应该以反对官僚主义和反对违法乱纪为重点，由此带动反对命令主义的斗争。这也是山东分局所总结出来的经验。这就更加突出地表现了有重点、有步骤、有分寸的积极而稳进的方针。事实证明，领导机关和领导干部的官僚主义作风是造成基层干部强迫命令作风的重要原因；而违法乱纪的罪行也往往托庇于官僚主义而逍遥法外。所以首先要从上而下地反对领导机关和领导干部中的官僚主义。但同时必须看到，目前许多领导机关和领导干部中的官僚主义作风，又是和各自为政的分散主义、脱离实际的主观主义互相联系的。因此，在领导机关和领导干部中反对官僚主义的同时，还要反对分散主义和主观主义。山东地区就是这样做了。他们从加强党委制、加强党的统一领导入手，纠正各自为政的分散主义现象；同时批判了脱离小农经济实际情况的主观主义，切实贯彻以农业生产为农村中压倒一切的工作的思想，实行全盘筹划、统一布置，坚决克服农村中的“五多”现象；接着派遣大批负责干部深入基层，检查工作，从实际工作中检查领导上的官僚主义，发动群众和干部批评领导上的官僚主义，并且把联系实际联系群众的正确思想作风和工作方法带到基层去，具体帮助基层干部克服命令主义。这就大大受到基层干部的欢迎，带动了他们自觉地进行反对命令主义的斗争。一般基层干部反映：“上级领导变样了！”“早知道走群众路线这样好，谁还去强迫命令？”在这一斗争中，同时发动广大群众来揭发违法乱纪的现象，并且选择对当时当地广大群众有教育意义的比较典型的坏人坏事，大张旗鼓地进行处理。这就更加鼓舞了自下而上的批评精神，打击邪气，伸张正气，使广大基层干部的政治思想水平大大提高。
    在领导这一斗争中还必须表扬和树立正确的思想作风和工作方法。积极地适当地表扬好人好事。三月十一日中共中央山东分局给各地的指示中曾明确提出：“要先抓住比较突出的典型的坏人坏事加以处理，以打击邪气，伸张正义，振奋人心，为反对官僚主义、命令主义及违法乱纪斗争开辟道路。而后要选择比较典型的好人好事加以表扬，以发扬正气，树立榜样。”并指出：“全省每一县都要选择一个典型的足以令人警戒的坏人坏事和一个典型的足以令人仿效的好人好事登载报纸。”他们还召开了县区乡三级干部会、党代表会、人民代表会和大小规模的人民来信处理会和典型案件处理会。在这些会议上处理了坏人坏事，表扬了好人好事，开展了自上而下和自下而上相结合的批评和自我批评，鼓舞着广大基层干部更加有信心地按照正确的思想作风去开展工作。不少县以上的党委又抽出若干负责干部比较长期地深入基层，建立工作基点，和基层干部一起向群众学习，帮助他们在各项工作中建立正确的思想作风和工作方法。中共中央山东分局和若干地委、县委都注意运用了内部通报和报纸上的公开报道，来及时传播和推广改进工作作风的典型事迹和经验教训。
    山东的经验证明，领导反官僚主义斗争的方针，必须是积极的，而又是稳步前进的。我们要反对这些现象：号召开展反官僚主义斗争，实际上却把这一斗争向后一再推迟，认为它会妨害当前的工作；号召开展批评和自我批评，但又对批评者大发雷霆；号召大家要稳步前进，但一动起来就是“猛攻猛斗”；号召对待干部要慎重，事实上又把“慎重”作为自由主义的藉口；派了许多检查组到基层检查工作，而不少检查组在实际上又变成“官僚主义的检查组”。我们在积极稳进的方针下，对于坏人坏事必须予以严肃处理；在党内外必须大力开展批评和自我批评；对于干部和群众中的好人好事必须加以表扬，在当前各项工作中必须认真树立正确的工作作风。目前为了更好地吸取最近一个时期的反官僚主义斗争的经验教训，各地党委应该仿效山东的做法，认真地总结这个工作，坚持积极稳进的方针，以便继续贯彻反官僚主义的斗争。
