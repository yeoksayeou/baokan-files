Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 8th: Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai today replied to General Clark's letter of June 29th. Clark's letter was a response to the question raised by the Korean and Chinese side on June 19th regarding the Lee Seung-man's forced detention of prisoners of war.

As Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai pointed out in their letter, Clark's reply of June 29th is not entirely satisfactory. A careful study of Clark's reply reveals that this accusation by the Korean and Chinese side is entirely correct.

Clark admits that Lee Seung-man's forced detention of prisoners of war is a "serious incident" that does not help the early realization of the Korean armistice. However, on the other hand, he tries his best to shirk the responsibility that the American side should bear for this incident, and uses pretexts to refuse to seriously retrieve the prisoners of war detained by Lee Seung-man. Clark said that the United Nations Command has no right to command the Lee Seung-man regime because this regime is "an independent and sovereign country." Even Clark himself knows that his statement is inconsistent with the facts when he calls the Lee Seung-man regime "an independent and sovereign country." Who doesn't know that the Lee Seung-man regime is a puppet government fostered by the United States? Who doesn't know that without the support of the United States, the Lee Seung-man government would not be able to maintain itself for a single day? Clark also said that the armistice is a "military armistice between the military commanders of both sides." Doesn't the United Nations Command represent the governments, including the U.S. government and the Lee Seung-man government, that have troops participating in the Korean War to negotiate? Even if an armistice agreement is signed in the future, can the governments of the countries concerned arbitrarily refuse to implement it without being bound by it? Clark's attempt to shirk the serious responsibility of the United Nations Command in the "release" of prisoners of war is futile.

In his statement issued on June 21st, Clark admitted, "We certainly recognize that the South Korean government has the ability to take unilateral action to release prisoners of war. We also know that some elements in the South Korean government have privately and publicly advocated taking such action." Nevertheless, Clark did not take any measures to prevent this action from happening. Shouldn't the U.S. government be held responsible for this obvious attitude of condoning it?

After the Lee Seung-man "released" the prisoners of war, the U.S. government's connivance at Lee Seung-man's actions to undermine the prisoner of war agreement became even more obvious. Since Clark is the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command who commands the South Korean troops, has he taken any due military measures against the South Korean troops who openly defied his orders and scorned his authority by "releasing" prisoners of war? No!

Apart from saying empty words about "taking practical and feasible measures" to find the prisoners of war, has Clark seriously taken effective measures to recover the prisoners of war from Lee Seung-man? Has he ordered his military police to arrest the prisoners of war walking all over the streets? No!

Not only did Clark not take these necessary measures, but he continued to allow the South Korean troops to guard the prisoner of war camps, so that for five consecutive days, Lee Seung-man transferred large numbers of prisoners of war from the prisoner of war camps under Clark's jurisdiction without hindrance. Only when almost all the prisoner of war camps were empty did Clark send American troops to replace the South Korean troops. At the same time, Clark ordered the American military police not to pursue those "released" prisoners of war who were walking in the streets in one line after another under the escort of South Korean troops and police.

In his letter to Lee Seung-man on June 19th, Clark also said: "I cannot now estimate what consequences your sudden and surprising action will ultimately have, and I cannot now predict what impact this action will have on the common cause for which we have made such great sacrifices in the past few years." After a few days, what "consequences" were there? What "impact" was there? Naturally, the whole world can see, and Clark should also see, that the consequence and impact is that the realization of the Korean armistice is in danger of being undermined.

All these actions by the American side give people every reason to believe that Lee Seung-man dared to forcibly detain prisoners of war with the connivance and encouragement of the U.S. government.

Clark said, "To say that a considerable number of these prisoners of war can be recovered would be unrealistic and misleading, because they have disappeared into the population..." He also said that it is "impossible" to recover all these prisoners of war.

Why is it "unrealistic"? All the "released" prisoners of war are in the hands of the South Korean troops and South Korean police, and many have already gone to nearby South Korean military training locations with the assistance of South Korean military personnel. International News Service reporter Himaff reported on June 24th that the South Korean police are concentrating their efforts on carrying out "thorough roll calls and inspections" of all the "released" prisoners of war scattered throughout South Korea. Is it possible that the United Nations Command does not know what American reporters know?

What kind of "misunderstanding" is afraid of being caused? Is it the "misunderstanding" referred to in Clark's statement on June 21st that "makes people suspect that the South Korean government and the United Nations Command are in collusion"? If so, Clark has no other way to eliminate this "misunderstanding" unless he seriously recovers the "released" prisoners of war. If Clark does not do this, it will make people even more suspicious that the U.S. government and Lee Seung-man are "in collusion."

Clark should and could have recovered the prisoners of war detained by Lee Seung-man, but now he says: This is impossible. People cannot help but conclude that Lee Seung-man's actions to forcibly detain prisoners of war have been condoned and protected by the U.S. government.

In order to cover up the U.S. government's connivance at Lee Seung-man's attitude, Clark once again put forward the old accusation that the Korean and Chinese side had released 50,000 South Korean prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly made a thorough rebuttal of this kind of confusing right and wrong, so that the U.S. side has not dared to officially mention it at the negotiating table for a long time. Now Clark raises this point again. Does this imply that the U.S. government is also prepared to condone Lee Seung-man to "release" all the remaining prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camps?

Clark said that the Korean and Chinese side's accusations against the United Nations Command's connivance at Lee Seung-man's detention of prisoners of war "tend to hinder rather than promote the armistice agreement." But this statement is useless. World public opinion recognizes that it is not the Korean and Chinese side's accusations that hinder the conclusion of the armistice agreement, but the fact that Lee Seung-man detained prisoners of war.

On the other hand, Clark expressed his desire to strive for an early armistice in his reply and made guarantees. Clark said: "The fact that certain provisions in the armistice agreement require the cooperation of the authorities of the Republic of Korea is recognized. You are hereby assured that the United Nations Command and the governments of the countries concerned will do everything possible to obtain the cooperation of the government of the Republic of Korea. Where necessary, the United Nations Command will do everything in its power to establish military defense measures to ensure that the armistice terms will be observed."

These expressions and guarantees are necessary. But these expressions and guarantees are not completely certain, and the question of whether the armistice includes Lee Seung-man has not been clearly answered. If the United Nations Command does not take effective steps to make these "guarantees" come true, then how can the Korean armistice be prevented from being undermined?

What the world now needs is for the United States to responsibly handle the "release" of prisoners of war, not only to make guarantees in writing, but also to prove with actions that the United States can make Lee Seung-man abide by all the terms of the armistice. President Eisenhower himself said on April 16th: "The test of truth is very simple, only action is convincing." Although the Korean and Chinese side are not completely satisfied with Clark's reply, they still agreed to resume negotiations today to discuss the implementation of the armistice agreement and various preparations before the signing of the armistice agreement, which is a convincing action to prove the sincerity of the Korean and Chinese side towards the armistice. Now it depends on what convincing actions the U.S. side will take to prove their sincerity in making the Korean armistice a reality as soon as possible, and to guarantee that the armistice agreement will not be undermined after it is signed.

    新华社记者评克拉克的来信
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员今天答复了克拉克将军六月二十九日的来信。克拉克那封信，是答复朝中方面在六月十九日就李承晚强迫扣留战俘事件提出的质问的。
    正如金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员在信中所指出的，克拉克六月二十九日的答复是不能令人完全满意的，如果把克拉克的复信仔细研究一下，那就可以看出，朝中方面这个指责是十分正确的。
    克拉克承认，李承晚强迫扣留战俘是一个“严重的事件”，对于朝鲜停战的早日实现是没有助益的，但是另一方面却又极力推卸美国方面对于这个事件应负的责任，并且托词不肯认真追回被李承晚扣留的战俘。克拉克说，联合国军司令部无权指挥李承晚政权，因为这个政权是“一个独立自主的国家”。把李承晚政权称做是“一个独立自主的国家”，连克拉克自己也知道他这种说法是与事实不符的。谁不知道李承晚政权是美国一手扶植起来的傀儡政府？谁不知道如果没有美国的支持，李承晚政府一天也维持不下去呢？克拉克又说停战是“双方军事司令官之间的军事停战”，难道联合国军并不代表有军队参加朝鲜战争的包括美国政府和李承晚政府在内的政府来进行谈判么？难道即使将来停战协定签订了，各有关国家的政府可以不受约束而任意拒绝履行的吗？克拉克极力推卸联合国军司令部在“释放”战俘事件中应负的严重责任，这是徒劳的。
    克拉克在他六月二十一日发表的声明中承认，“我们当然认识到韩国政府有能力采取释放战俘的片面行动。我们也知道韩国政府中的某些分子曾私下和公开地鼓吹采取这种行动。”虽然如此，克拉克却没有采取任何措施来防止这种行动的发生，难道美国政府不应该对这种显然的纵容态度负责吗？
    在李承晚“释放”战俘事件发生以后，美国政府对李承晚破坏战俘协议的行动的纵容，就更加明显了。克拉克既然是指挥南朝鲜部队的联合国军总司令，可是他对于公然违抗他的命令，蔑视他的职权而“释放”战俘的南朝鲜部队，有没有采取任何理所应有的军法措施呢？没有！
    克拉克除了空口说要“采取实际可行的措施”把战俘找回来以外，有没有认真地采取有效措施向李承晚追回战俘呢？有没有下命令给他的宪兵，叫他们抓回满街走着的战俘呢？没有！
    克拉克非但没有采取这些应有的措施，反而继续让南朝鲜部队守卫战俘营，以致接连五天，李承晚毫无阻碍地将大批战俘从克拉克管辖下的战俘营中押走。只在所有战俘营几乎空了的时候，克拉克才派美国军队去代替南朝鲜军队。同时，克拉克下令给美国宪兵，不许他们去追回那些在南朝鲜部队和警察押解下一队又一队地在大街上走过的“被释放的”战俘。
    克拉克在六月十九日给李承晚的信中也曾说：“我现在不能估计你这种突然的令人吃惊的行动最后将产生什么后果，而且现在也不能预测这种行动将会给我们在过去几年中为之作了这么大的牺牲的共同事业带来了什么影响。”经过几天之后，有了什么“后果”呢？有了什么“影响”呢？自然，全世界都可以看见，克拉克也应该看见，后果和影响就是朝鲜停战的实现有被破坏了的危险。
    美国方面的这一切所作所为，使人完全有理由确信：李承晚是在美国政府的纵容和鼓励之下，才敢于强迫扣留战俘的。
    克拉克说，“如谓这些战俘可以追回相当的数目，则会是不现实的，而且会引起误解的，因为他们已经消失在居民中……。”他还说，要全部追回这些战俘是“不可能的”。
    为什么是“不现实的”呢？所有被“释放”的战俘都是在南朝鲜军队和南朝鲜警察手里，而且许多已经在南朝鲜军事人员的协助下到附近的南朝鲜军事训练地点去了。国际新闻社记者希马夫在六月二十四日曾经报道说，南朝鲜警察正在集中力量对散处在南朝鲜各地的全部被“释放”的战俘实行“彻底点名和检查”。难道美国记者们知道的事情，联合国军司令部竟然不知道？
    怕引起什么样的“误解”呢？是克拉克在六月二十一日的声明中所指的“使人怀疑韩国政府和联合国军司令部串通一气”的“误解”吗？如果是这样，克拉克没有别的办法来消除这种“误解”，除非他把被“释放”的战俘认真地追回来。如果克拉克不这样做，这就使人更加怀疑美国政府和李承晚是“串通一气”的。
    克拉克完全应该而且可能追回被李承晚扣留的战俘，可是现在他说：这是不可能的。人们不能不得出结论：李承晚强迫扣留战俘的行动，受到了美国政府的纵容和包庇。
    克拉克为了掩饰美国政府对李承晚的纵容态度，又提出了老一套的指责，说朝中方面曾经释放过五万名南朝鲜战俘。关于这种混淆是非的说法，朝中方面已经一再作过彻底的驳斥，以致好久以来美方在谈判中都不敢正式提到桌面上来。现在克拉克又提出这一点来，这是不是暗示着：美国政府还准备纵容李承晚把剩下在战俘营里的战俘也全部“释放”呢？
    克拉克说，朝中方面对于联合国军司令部纵容李承晚扣留战俘所提出的指责，“是趋于阻碍，而非促成停战协定的”。可是这种说法是没有用处的。全世界社会舆论都承认阻碍停战协定的达成的，并不是朝中方面的指责，而是李承晚扣留战俘这个事实。
    另一方面，克拉克在复信中表示了争取早日达成停战的愿望，并且提出了保证。克拉克说：“停战协定中某些规定需要大韩民国当局的合作，这一事实是被认识到的。兹向你们保证：联合国军与利害相关的各国政府将尽一切努力以取得大韩民国政府的合作。遇有必要之处，联合国军将尽其所能建立军事上的防卫措施，以保证停战条款将被遵守。”
    这种表示和这些保证都是必要的。但是这些表示和保证还不完全确定，停战究竟是否包括李承晚在内这个问题并没有得到明确的答复。如果联合国军不采取有效步骤来使这些“保证”兑现，那末如何能使朝鲜停战不遭受破坏。
    全世界现在需要的是美国负责地来处理“释放”战俘事件，不但在书面提出保证，而且用行动来证明美国能够使李承晚遵守全部停战条款。艾森豪威尔总统自己在四月十六日说过：“对于真理的考验很简单，只有行动才有说服力。”朝中方面虽然不能完全满意克拉克的答复，今天仍然同意恢复谈判，商谈有关停战协定的实施以及停战协定签字前的各种准备工作，这就是证明朝中方面对停战具有诚意的一个有说服力的行动。现在就要看美方拿出什么有说服力的行动，来证明他们诚意使朝鲜停战迅速实现，而且保证停战协定在签订以后不致遭受破坏。
