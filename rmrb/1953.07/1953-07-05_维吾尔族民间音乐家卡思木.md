Uyghur Folk Musician Qasmu
	Du Pengcheng, Wang Lichen

	Kashgar city is an ancient passage for east-west communication and a bridge for cultural exchange in our country. This ancient city on the frontier of the motherland is still the center of cultural and artistic activities for the Uyghur people in southern Xinjiang.

	Here, we visited Qasmu, a famous Uyghur musician. He is a sixty-eight-year-old man with graying temples, and one of the excellent successors to the Uyghur classical music art.

	Qasmu has lived in Kashgar city for generations and grew up in a family with a strong musical atmosphere. He began his musical career at the age of fourteen, following his father and famous artists in Xinjiang to learn the classical music that has been passed down among the Uyghur people for generations. He traveled throughout the cities and villages of southern Xinjiang. Although he was illiterate, he accumulated countless tunes and lyrics through his love of music and diligent study. The people of southern Xinjiang love this old artist. Wherever he went, after the news spread, people from dozens of miles away came to listen to his singing and playing.

	Qasmu's most outstanding performance in music is that he can play and sing all of the most famous Twelve Muqam of the Uyghur people. The Twelve Muqam are the most complex and content-rich classical music in Uyghur music. It is said that hundreds of years ago, in the Kashgar area, many Uyghur people could play and sing all of this piece of music. Later, some parts were slowly lost, and only fragments were passed down among the people. Currently, only a few people in the entire Xinjiang can play and sing it completely, one is Turdi, a seventy-three-year-old famous artist in Shache; and the other is Qasmu.

	When we visited Qasmu, he introduced the content and history of the Twelve Muqam in detail. Qasmu said: The Twelve Muqam are a treasure of Xinjiang people's music. This piece of music is divided into twelve major sections, including one hundred and sixty-seven minor sections. If it is played in its entirety from beginning to end, it will take nineteen hours. If it is played separately, each section will take two hours. In terms of content, the Twelve Muqam can be divided into three parts: the first part is "Qonghraqman", which was recorded by the great poet Navoi five hundred years ago; the second part is "Dastan", which was composed by the great folk artist Bo Ai Kengbo'er, and the lyrics were written by the brothers Yusufu and Animaiti four hundred years ago; the third part is "Moxilefu", the music and lyrics were written by the famous artist Moxilefu three hundred years ago, so the music and lyrics are named after him. The Twelve Muqam include descriptions of religious events, ancient wars, the struggles of working people, and the pain and love lives of the people; in terms of style, there are majestic and enthusiastic, light and cheerful, and so on. The Twelve Muqam are the crystallization of the collective wisdom of generations of music-loving people. They have continuously enriched this great work with their new creations, and with the collection, collation, and processing of musicians, it has become the complete art form it is today.

	When Qasmu talked about his experiences in the old society and his life in the new society, his weathered face twitched slightly, and his eyes moistened. He said: From the time I started my musical life at the age of fourteen until the liberation of the people of Xinjiang in 1949, hunger and poverty followed me like a shadow for more than fifty years. In the past, I wandered around southern Xinjiang, singing and playing for people when they got married, just to get a bowl of rice; sometimes in those deserted places, I endured hunger, walking and singing alone. When I was tired, I would just lie on the Gobi desert or grassland, using my musical instrument as a pillow, and endure the long, dark night full of wind and sand. Later, I often thought: I am an old man in my sixties and seventies, and the fire of my life will not burn for long. Perhaps the Twelve Muqam will be lost. After the liberation of Xinjiang, I no longer suffered from hunger, I joined the song and dance troupe and became younger. In 1950, the People's Government invited me to Dihua. During the seventy-five days in Dihua, many Han artists and I studied the Twelve Muqam. They often said to me: This is the wealth of the motherland's culture, and we hope that we can preserve it together. Later, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Cultural Undertakings Administration made a recording of the Twelve Muqam, and now the Communist Party and the People's Government have sent experts to collate and study it. This matter was widely spread among the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for a time. Many folk artists talked to me about this matter, and they all said: Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can our Uyghur culture and art live forever!

	Qasmu and his assistants enthusiastically played a part of the Twelve Muqam for us, the guests who had come from afar. One of Qasmu's assistants was playing the "Dap" (leather drum), another was playing the "Qiang" (a zither with forty-eight strings), and he was playing the "Sata" (similar to a sanxian with twelve strings). After playing an overture, they began to sing in unison. Among the sounds of various stringed instruments, sometimes it sounded like thousands of horses galloping and weapons clashing; sometimes like birds singing in the mountains and forests, and streams flowing gently; sometimes like wind sweeping the Gobi desert and camel bells jingling. During the intervals between playing and singing, I found that three or four hundred people were crowding downstairs listening, including young people, children, and old people with white beards. They were attracted by the music. When they played again, the audience danced to the light, cheerful, and rhythmic music.

    维吾尔族民间音乐家卡思木
    杜鹏程  王立忱
    喀什噶尔城是我国古代东西交通的孔道，文化交流的桥梁。这座祖国边疆的古城，至今仍是新疆南部维吾尔族人民文化艺术活动的中心。
    我们在这里访问了维吾尔族著名的音乐家卡思木。他是一位六十八岁鬓发斑白的老人，是维吾尔族古典音乐艺术的优秀的继承者之一。
    卡思木世代居住在喀什噶尔城，生长在一个音乐气氛浓厚的家庭里。他十四岁就开始了音乐生涯，跟随父亲和新疆有名的艺人，学习维吾尔族历代在民间流传的古典音乐。他走遍了南疆的城市和乡村，他虽然不识字，但是凭着自己对音乐的喜爱和勤学苦练，积累了无数的曲调和歌词。南疆各地人民，都热爱这位老艺人。他每到一处，消息传出后，几十里以外的人，都赶来听他的弹唱。
    卡思木在音乐上最出色的表现，是他能够全部弹奏和歌唱维吾尔族最著名的十二部玛卡姆曲。十二部玛卡姆，是维吾尔族音乐中曲调最复杂、内容最丰富的古典音乐。据说，百年前，在喀什噶尔一带，维吾尔族人民中有很多人都能全部弹唱这支乐曲，后来有些部分慢慢失传，只是片断地流传在民间。目前全疆只发现几个人能全部弹唱，一个是莎车的七十三岁的著名艺人吐尔的；一个就是卡思木。
    当我们访问卡思木时，他详细地向我们介绍了十二部玛卡姆曲的内容和历史。卡思木说：十二部玛卡姆，是新疆人民音乐的宝藏。这部乐曲共分十二部大曲，其中包括一百六十七个小曲，如果从头到尾全部演奏一次，要十九个小时，分开演奏，每部要演奏两小时。十二部玛卡姆曲从内容上讲，可分作三大部分：第一部分是“穷拉克曼”，是五百年前的大诗人那瓦依记载的；第二部分是“达斯坦”，是民间大艺人伯艾坑波儿作曲，歌词是四百年前的玉素甫和阿尼买提兄弟两人作的；第三部分是“莫希来甫”，曲词是三百年前著名艺人莫希来甫所作，故曲词冠以人名。十二部玛卡姆，有描述宗教事迹的，有描述古代战争的，有描述劳动人民斗争的，有描写人民痛苦和爱情生活的；从格调上说，有雄壮热烈的，有轻松愉快的等等。十二部玛卡姆是历代爱好音乐的人民集体智慧的结晶，他们不断以自己新的创作补充丰富了这个伟大的作品，再加上音乐家的采集、整理和加工，才有了现在这样完整的艺术形态。
    当卡思木谈到他在旧社会的遭遇和在新社会的生活时，饱经风霜的脸微微抽动，两眼湿润。他说：当我从十四岁开始音乐生活时起，到一九四九年新疆人民获得解放为止，五十多年的岁月中，饥饿和穷困像影子一样追随着我。过去，我流浪在南疆各地，当人家结婚时，我给人家弹弹唱唱，混一碗饭吃；有时在那些荒漠的地方，忍受着饥饿，独自个儿边走、边唱。走累了，就随便躺在戈壁上或草滩上，枕着乐器，熬过那风沙满天的漫长黑夜。后来我常想：我是六七十岁的老人了，生命的火已不会燃烧很久了，也许十二部玛卡姆要失传了。新疆解放后，我再不忍饥受饿了，我参加了歌舞团，变得年青了。一九五○年人民政府把我请到迪化，在迪化的七十五天生活中，很多汉族的艺术家和我研究十二部玛卡姆，他们经常向我说：这是祖国文化的财富，希望我们共同把它保存下来。后来新疆省人民政府文化事业管理处，把十二部玛卡姆作了录音，现在共产党和人民政府派了专家正在整理研究。这件事在我们新疆各族人民中，盛传一时。有许多民间艺人和我谈起这件事，都说：只有在共产党领导下，才使我们维吾尔族的文化艺术永生！
    卡思木和他的助手们，热情地为我们这远道而来的客人，演奏了十二部玛卡姆的一部分。卡思木的一位助手敲着“达泼”（皮鼓），另一个助手弹着“羌”（这是有四十八根弦的琴），他弹着“沙塔”（形似三弦有十二根弦）。他们奏了一个序曲以后，就同声歌唱起来。在各种弦乐声音中，有时像万马奔腾、兵器相击；有时像鸟鸣山林，泉水轻流；有时像风卷戈壁，驼铃叮当。在弹唱间歇时，我发现有三、四百人拥挤在楼下倾听，其中有青年人，有小孩，也有胡须苍白的老人。他们被音乐声吸引住了，当他们再次演奏时，听众都随着那轻松愉快而节奏明显的音乐声翩翩起舞了。
