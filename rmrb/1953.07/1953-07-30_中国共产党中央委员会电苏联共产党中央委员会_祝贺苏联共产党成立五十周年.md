    Telegram from the Central Committee, Communist Party of China, to the Central Committee, Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Congratulating the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on its Fiftieth Anniversary
    [This newspaper reports] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, congratulating the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on its fiftieth anniversary. The telegram reads as follows:
    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:
    On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends its warmest congratulations to you. The victory of Leninism at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party fifty years ago was a major event in the history of the entire international workers' movement. The formation and development of the Leninist party made the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 possible, made the emergence of the world's first socialist country possible, and made the rapid formation and development of communist parties in various countries possible. The glorious experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society proclaimed to all mankind for the first time that socialism is not only a beautiful ideal, but also a beautiful reality and the only way out for the working people of the world. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the Soviet people to defeat fascist aggression, thereby fundamentally changing the international situation. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has become a powerful leading core for the people of all countries in the world in their struggle for peace, democracy, and progress against war and reaction.
    The Communist Party of China was founded and developed by taking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an example. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the development of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the encouragement and assistance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people. The Communist Party of China deeply understands the great significance of the complete unity of the people of the Soviet Union and China for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism in the Soviet Union and China and the world, and firmly believes that the great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China will be increasingly consolidated.
    We wish the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people new victories in the struggle to build communism and defend world peace under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the most reliable successor to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中国共产党中央委员会电苏联共产党中央委员会
    祝贺苏联共产党成立五十周年
    【本报讯】中国共产党中央委员会致电苏联共产党中央委员会，祝贺苏联共产党成立五十周年。电文如下：苏联共产党中央委员会：在苏联共产党成立五十周年的时候，中国共产党中央委员会向你们谨致最热烈的祝贺。列宁主义在五十年前俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会上的胜利，是整个国际工人运动历史上的重大事件。列宁主义政党的形成和发展，使一九一七年伟大的十月社会主义革命成为可能，使世界上第一个社会主义国家的出现成为可能，使各国共产主义政党的迅速形成和发展成为可能。苏联共产党建成社会主义社会的光荣经验，第一次向全人类宣告了社会主义不仅是美好的理想，而且已经是美好的现实，是全世界劳动人民的唯一出路所在。苏联共产党领导苏联人民击败了法西斯侵略，从而根本改变了国际形势。苏联共产党已经成为全世界各国人民争取和平民主进步而反对战争和反动的强大的领导核心。
    中国共产党是以苏联共产党为榜样而成立和发展起来的。中国人民革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的发展，同苏联共产党、苏联政府、苏联人民的鼓舞和援助是分不开的。中国共产党深刻了解苏中两国人民的完全团结一致对于苏中两国和世界和平民主社会主义事业的重要意义，并且深信苏中两国人民之间的伟大友谊将日益巩固。
    谨祝苏联共产党和苏联人民在伟大的列宁斯大林事业的最可靠的继承者苏联共产党中央委员会领导之下，在建设共产主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中获得新的胜利。
    中国共产党中央委员会
         一九五三年七月三十日
