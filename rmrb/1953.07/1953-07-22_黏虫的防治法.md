    Editor's Note: This article introduces several relatively effective methods for preventing and controlling armyworms. When leading the masses in preventing and controlling armyworms, cadres in various regions can teach these methods to the masses and lead them in experiments and adoption. When using these methods to kill armyworms, be careful not to trample or break the crops, causing unnecessary damage to the masses. At the same time, attention should be paid to the severe toxicity of arsenic (i.e., arsenic trioxide) used in some insecticides to prevent accidental injury to people and livestock.
    This year, armyworms have occurred in many areas. This pest poses a great threat to autumn crops. According to reports from various regions, it is estimated that this pest will pose a risk of another large-scale outbreak from late July to early August. Now, several effective prevention and control methods used in various regions are introduced as follows:

    I. Predicting the Occurrence of Armyworm Moths. Based on the prevention and control experience in Northeast China this year, in areas where armyworms have occurred, key armyworm forecasting stations should be established to quickly detect armyworm moths, so that prevention and control work can be carried out early and proactively. According to the habit of armyworm moths loving to eat sugary liquid, use fermented liquid of kenaf seed cake, rotten melon juice, or sugar-vinegar water to attract them. Check every night. If you find that armyworm moths are gradually increasing, you should actively carry out prevention and control.

    II. Collecting Eggs and Catching Moths. This is an effective measure to suppress the large-scale occurrence of armyworms and is also the basic method of artificial control of armyworms at present. Armyworm eggs are laid on the upper end of the leaves of crops such as millet, wheat, and sorghum, near the edge of the underside of the leaves or on the leaf sheaths. If eggs are laid on millet leaves, the upper end of the millet leaves will be folded lengthwise, which is easy to find during inspection. Collect the eggs before they hatch, picking the leaves together and burning them centrally. Do not throw them in the farmland. Insect eggs should be checked every two to three days. And it is necessary to collect them as soon as they are found, so that the eggs laid successively can be basically collected.

    III. Methods for Killing Armyworm Moths: 1. Use iron wire or bamboo pieces (thin branches are also acceptable) and coarse gauze to make a net bag, install a handle of four to five feet long, and use the bag to kill moths at night when they are active. 2. Use rice straw or wheat straw to tie into grass bundles, apply attractant poison on them, insert them into the crop fields in the evening, about ten grass bundles per mu, to attract and kill armyworm moths. The attractant poison is prepared by using two parts of wine, two parts of vinegar, two to four parts of water, six parts of brown sugar (or honey), plus some arsenic trioxide (generally half a tael to one tael of arsenic trioxide powder is added to one jin of wine, vinegar, sugar, and water). First, completely dissolve the brown sugar in water, then mix it with arsenic trioxide powder, wine, and vinegar, and use it to coat the grass bundles.

    IV. Killing Larvae. There are many methods for killing larvae, and various regions should adopt them according to local conditions. The time for catching and beating should be in the morning and evening. The effect is greatest before 5:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m. On cloudy days, catching and beating can be done all day. 1. Sweeping method: Tie a dustpan with a rod two to three feet long, hold the broom in one hand and the dustpan in the other, sweep the armyworms into the dustpan, and kill them centrally. In fields with taller crops, the rod on the dustpan can be shortened or not tied. 2. Armyworm Net (see Figure 1). The armyworm net is a net with a frame, narrower at the front and wider at the back. When catching insects, wear the net on your body and hold a wooden stick of more than one foot long, walk along the crop rows and beat, so that the insects fall into the net. 3. Armyworm Cart (see Figure 2). The rope is套 (tao) around the neck and pushed forward, and the hands hold wooden sticks to beat along the rows, shaking the insects into the cloth net. 4. Armyworm Net (see Figure 3). When using this net to catch insects, hold the wooden handle and place the crops on both sides of the row in the gaps of the two cloth bags at both ends of the wooden stick, push forward along the row while shaking, so that the lower part of the net collides with the crop stalks and shakes the insects into the cloth bag.

    V. Digging Ditches for Blockade. In areas where armyworms occur seriously, the method of digging ditches for blockade can be used to prevent the migration of armyworm larvae, and they can be buried centrally. This ditch is one foot deep and wide, and the outer wall of the ditch should be vertical or inclined inward, so that the insects are not easy to climb up. Dig a small pit five inches to one foot deep every five feet at the bottom of the ditch, and sweep the larvae that fall into the ditch into the small pit for centralized burial.

    VI. Protecting Natural Enemies. Ground beetles ( *Carabus callosus*, *Eocanthecona furcellata*, hard-shelled beetles, and their larvae are also called scorpion-like knives), parasitic wasps, and parasitic flies are all natural enemies of armyworms. Adult or larvae of ground beetles eat armyworms, and larvae of parasitic wasps and parasitic flies parasitize in the body of armyworms, destroying the internal organs of armyworms. In some places, it is wrong to mistake the white cocoons of parasitic wasps for armyworm eggs and collect them. We should protect these natural enemies of armyworms and use them to help people kill armyworms.

    Note: Armyworms have many other names, some are called 粘虫 (nián chóng), 绵虫 (mián chóng), 虸蚄 (zī fāng), 五色虫 (wǔ sè chóng), 剃枝虫 (tì zhī chóng), and some are called 夜盗虫 (yè dào chóng) or 行军虫 (xíng jūn chóng). (Attached pictures)

    黏虫的防治法
    中央农业部植物保护司
    编者按：本文介绍了几种防治黏虫的比较有效的办法。各地干部在领导群众防治黏虫时，可以把这些办法教给群众，并带领群众试验采用。在采用这些方法捕杀黏虫时，注意不要踩坏了或碰断了庄稼，使群众遭受不应有的损害；同时应注意某些杀虫药剂内所用的信石（即砒霜）的剧烈毒性，严防误伤人畜。
    今年在不少地区发生了黏虫。这种害虫对秋庄稼的危害很大。根据各地报告估计，这种害虫在七月下旬至八月上旬有再一次大量发生的危险。现在把各地使用有效的几种防治办法介绍如下：
    一、预测黏虫蛾的发生。根据今年东北地区的防治经验，在发生过黏虫的地区，要重点建立黏虫预测站，迅速发现黏虫蛾，使防治工作提早和争取主动。可根据黏虫蛾爱吃糖味液汁的习性，用洋麻籽饼的醱酵液、烂瓜果汁或糖醋水等来诱集它。每晚检查，如果发现黏虫蛾逐渐增多，就应积极进行防治。
    二、采卵捕蛾。这是抑止黏虫大量发生的有效措施，也是目前人工除治黏虫的基本方法。黏虫的卵是产在谷子、麦子、高粱等庄稼的叶部上端，叶背近边缘处或叶鞘上。如产卵在谷叶上，谷叶的上端就会纵摺起来，检查时很易发现。采卵要在它没有孵化以前，连叶摘下，集中烧毁，不可把它扔在庄稼地内。虫卵要每隔两三天检查一次。并且要做到随查随采，这样就可把先后产下的卵基本采净。
    三、捕杀黏虫蛾的方法：1、用铁丝或竹片（细树枝也可）和粗纱布做成网兜，装上四五尺长的柄，在晚间蛾子活动时用兜捕杀。2、用谷草或麦秸等绑成草把，上面涂上诱杀剂，傍晚插到庄稼地里，一亩地插十来个草把，诱杀黏虫蛾子。诱杀剂的配法是用酒二份，醋二份，水二份至四份，红糖
    （或蜂蜜）六份，再加上些信石（一般的酒、醋、糖、水是一斤加信石粉半两至一两），先把红糖完全溶化在水里，再和信石粉、酒、醋调匀，用它涂在草把上。
    四、捕杀幼虫。捕杀幼虫的方法较多，各地应因地制宜，选择采用。捕打的时间应在早晨和傍晚，在早晨五时以前和下午五时以后效果最大，阴天则可全天捕打。1、扫落法：用簸箕绑上长二尺到三尺的棍棒，一手持扫帚，一手持簸箕将黏虫扫落簸箕里，集中杀死。在庄稼苗较高的田里，可把簸箕上的棍棒缩短一些，或不绑棍棒。2、黏虫兜（见附图一）。黏虫兜是一个带有架子的兜，前头窄些，后面宽些，捕虫时把兜佩带身上，手持一尺多长的木棍，在庄稼垅内边走边打，使虫子跌落在兜里。3、黏虫车（见附图二）。是把绳套在颈上，向前推进，两手持木棍顺垅拍打，将虫子震落在布网内。4、黏虫网（见附图三）。使用这种网捕虫时，手拿木柄，把行间两边的庄稼放在木棍两端的两个布袋夹缝中，顺垅向前推进，随走随摇，使网的下部碰撞庄稼秆，把虫震落到布袋里。
    五、挖沟封锁。在黏虫发生严重的地区可采用挖沟封锁的办法，阻止黏虫幼虫迁移，并可集中埋杀。这种沟深、宽各一尺，靠外面的沟壁要垂直或向内倾斜，这样虫子不易上爬。沟底每隔五尺挖一个深五寸到一尺的小坑，把掉在沟里的幼虫扫入小坑集中埋杀。
    六、保护天敌。步行虫（气不愤，铁柱蛄，硬盖虫，它的幼虫又叫蝎子留刀）、寄生蜂、寄生蝇都是黏虫的天敌。步行虫的成虫或幼虫都吃黏虫，寄生蜂，寄生蝇的幼虫寄生在黏虫体内，破坏黏虫的内脏。某些地方误把寄生蜂的白色茧子当成黏虫卵采下来是不对的。我们应该保护这些黏虫的天敌，利用它们帮助人们杀除黏虫。
    附注：黏虫的别名很多，有的叫?虫、绵虫、虸蚄、五色虫，剃枝虫，也有叫做夜盗虫或行军虫的。（附图片）
