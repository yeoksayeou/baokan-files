    Chongqing to have Eight Theatrical Troupes Go to Factories to Perform for Workers
    In the latter half of this year, Chongqing will have eight theatrical troupes go to factory areas to perform for workers and provide guidance for workers' cultural activities. The Southwest Sichuan Opera Institute Performance Team No. 1, the Experimental Sichuan Opera Institute, and the Chongqing Quyi Team have all gone to factories successively. The Southwest Sichuan Opera Institute Performance Team No. 1 went to Lijiatuo on July 1st to perform for factories such as the Shashi Yarn Factory and the China Woolen Mill, performing famous Sichuan operas such as "The Story of Willow Shade," "Autumn River," and "Judging Snow by Traces." In order to enable the troupes going to factories to perform better for the workers, the responsible comrades of the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles made a report to the troupes going to factories on how to learn from the workers. Before going to the factories, the Chongqing Quyi Team studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other documents.
    Xi'an Theatrical Troupes Stage Various New Plays in Succession
    Recently, various theatrical troupes in Xi'an have been staging various new plays in succession. The Northwest People's Drama Theatre began performing the famous Soviet drama "Dawn Over Moscow" on May 5th, and has now performed more than 30 shows, which have been warmly welcomed by workers, students, and cadres of government organizations. The Northwest People's Song and Dance Troupe began performing the opera "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" in early June, and in half a month, the audience has been close to 10,000 people. In May and June, the Qinqiang opera troupes in Xi'an staged classical song and dance dramas "The Tale of the White Snake," "The Romance of the West Chamber," and modern dramas "Luo Han Qian" and "The Young Son-in-Law." These Qinqiang operas have all been re-adapted or re-staged after the First National Opera Observation and Performance Conference.
    Recently, the theatrical troupes in Xi'an will continue to stage a batch of new plays, and the famous opera "The White Haired Girl," the drama "Women Representative," "Between Husband and Wife," and the Qinqiang opera "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" are being rehearsed.
