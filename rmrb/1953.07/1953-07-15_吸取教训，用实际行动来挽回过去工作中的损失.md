Learn from Lessons, Take Practical Actions to Recover Losses in Past Work
Ouyang Yi, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Highway Transportation Trade Union

Our Hunan Provincial Highway Transportation Trade Union, due to the long-standing presence of serious economism and guild-like thinking, neglected political and ideological education for workers, and failed to conduct due education and necessary struggle against behaviors that violated labor discipline, adopting instead a tailist attitude. Therefore, in many specific issues, we actually fostered the phenomenon of lax labor discipline among workers. It was only after studying the documents of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions that we recognized our mistakes.

These mistakes were primarily manifested in how we handled traffic accident cases. As early as 1951, Tang Guizhen, a driver from the Shaoyang Branch (now renamed Shaoyang General Station), had two accidents due to violating regulations and speeding. Our trade union did not educate him about this violation of operating procedures, believing that "since he had two accidents, he wouldn't make the same mistake again." However, in February 1952, Tang Guizhen again overturned a vehicle in Hongjiang, seriously injuring one person and slightly injuring eight others. The Hongjiang court sentenced him to two years in prison. At the time, the masses were very confused, with some saying, "Our drivers have lost their nerve!" Others said, "The moment you sit in the driver's seat, the prison door is open and waiting." In this situation, the trade union neither examined its past errors in handling this issue nor quickly clarified these confused thoughts. Instead, it believed that if the trade union didn't come forward to "rescue" him, it would "become detached from the masses and affect production." At the same time, it also believed that although Tang Guizhen had made a mistake, he was still one of "our own people," and "rescuing" him was precisely "representing the interests of the workers." Therefore, it publicly stated to the masses, "The trade union will be responsible for fighting this lawsuit to the end, everyone can rest assured." Subsequently, it sent documents to various levels of courts, the Provincial Supervisory Committee, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and other agencies to "appeal" for Tang Guizhen, with a total of fifteen official exchanges. In order to achieve his early release, it did not hesitate to exploit loopholes in the court's judgment and oppose the court. Within the trade union, a set of fallacious arguments formed in the handling of accident cases, namely, characterizing the court's sentencing of accident offenders as "punishment-ism"; describing accident casualties as "errors in labor, mistakes in production"; and using the term "education as the main focus" to shield certain people who did not abide by laws and regulations. Finally, the trade union simply created its own separate set of regulations, the so-called "Regulations on Handling Car Accidents," in which Article 9, Section 2 stipulated: "Due to special needs in production, with the guarantee of the administration and trade union, it may be changed to probation and reformed at work." Attempting to completely control the power of probation in the hands of the trade union. This was equivalent to telling employees that if an accident occurred, they would not be subject to the sanctions of national law (this "regulation" was later not approved by higher authorities).

Secondly, in dealing with the transfer of employees, our trade union has consistently adopted a tailist attitude. In December 1950, the Anshao line opened to traffic, and it was necessary to send a group of passenger cars to Anjiang, because the route was somewhat dangerous, and no one wanted to go. Logically, the trade union should have cooperated with the administration to persuade a group to take on this task. But the trade union did not do this. Instead, it accommodated the opinions of the backward masses and organized a lottery for them. The first group was drawn, but Shi Long, the driver of the first group who had originally advocated for the lottery, was unwilling to go, and made many excuses, at one moment saying that his wife was about to give birth, and at another moment saying that the car had problems, and he made a great fuss. At this time, the trade union did not educate Shi Long. Instead, it said that this was a "disadvantageous" matter, and asked the workers in the first group to accommodate him and not let him go. The group did not agree. The trade union then negotiated "prices" with Shi Long, spoke nicely, and promised that he would run a few more trips on the Changshao line in the future, run more mileage, and earn more money, and also lent him 400,000 yuan, which finally solved the problem. However, since then, it has often been impossible to dispatch cars to mountainous and dangerous routes. Some station managers said, "Currently, the biggest headache is not the lack of freight, but the inability to dispatch cars even when there is freight."

Because we have consistently failed to pay attention to educating workers and improving their awareness, but instead accommodated their backward thinking and condoned their failure to comply with labor discipline, workers' erroneous behaviors have developed day by day, causing great losses to the country's economic construction. For example, failure to comply with operating procedures and safety systems when driving has increased the damage rate of vehicles, so that the average perfect vehicle rate of the Transportation Bureau can only reach 65%, and the tire mileage in May only reached 85% of the quota at most, over-issuing 421 sets (worth 1.684 billion yuan), bringing serious threats to financial plans and cost plans. Accidents have also continued to increase. In the second quarter of 1952, an accident occurred every 130,000 kilometers. By the second quarter of this year, an accident occurred every 80,000 kilometers. The expenses for compensation for losses and medical and bereavement expenses alone amounted to more than 21 million yuan from January to May. As for the losses from vehicle downtime for repairs, it must be at least ten times greater than these expenses. The above situation seriously hinders the development of the transportation enterprise.

After studying the documents, we have initially recognized our mistakes. Comrade Lai Ruoyu said at the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions: "During the period of national construction, the most important and fundamental task of our trade union organization is, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to contact and educate the masses of workers, constantly improve the degree of awareness and organization of the masses of workers, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, unite the people of all strata, actively complete the national construction plan, and on the basis of developing production, gradually improve the material and cultural life of the working class and all working people, and strive to gradually realize the industrialization of the country and the transition to a socialist society." Our past work is far from this instruction. We have long existed in tailism and liberalism, and have not educated workers in the spirit of communism, improving the awareness of the masses of workers, and raising the backward to the advanced level. Instead, we have represented the backward demands of the workers, making the masses of workers fall into the quagmire of economism and extreme democracy, and unable to see the bright future of socialism.

Chairman Lai further instructed us: "Our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. This nature of our country stipulates that all measures of our country, in the final analysis, are to improve and protect the material and cultural welfare of the working class and all working people." However, our past view of this issue was extremely wrong. When dealing with traffic accident cases, we believed that the court was not guaranteeing the interests of the working class, and that only the trade union stood on the position of the working class and represented its interests. Therefore, when an accident occurred, we "litigated" with the court. During the wage reform, the workers regarded the administration as the object of struggle, and did not strictly criticize the trade union. We were complacent and thought that this was the result of "representing the interests of the workers" in the past.

The past lessons are painful, and we must recover the losses. We must resolutely implement the spirit of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's call, and under the unified leadership of the Party, conduct labor discipline education for all employees. The Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau and the Provincial Highway Transportation Trade Union have decided to conduct labor discipline education in the following steps:

First, in conjunction with summarizing the production of the previous quarter, examine the harm of lax labor discipline to the national plan and its root causes. At the same time, organize trade union cadres to study the documents of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and the First Provincial Congress of Trade Union Members, as well as newspaper editorials on rectifying labor discipline, to clearly establish the idea of doing a good job in production, and criticize the tailist tendencies adopted in the past towards the phenomenon of lax labor discipline;

Second, while compiling and mobilizing the masses to discuss and revise the third quarter plan and the July operation plan, conduct in-depth investigations, discover good examples of abiding by labor discipline, and commend them in order to set an example and drive the masses;

Third, organize the masses to study relevant documents, guide the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism, examine and expose the serious damage caused to the country by the phenomenon of lax labor discipline, and conduct self-education. On the basis of mass consciousness, mobilize the masses to incorporate compliance with labor discipline into patriotic covenants, making it one of the important contents of patriotic covenants.

    吸取教训，用实际行动来挽回过去工作中的损失
    湖南省公路运输工会主席  欧阳毅
    我们湖南省公路运输工会，由于长期存在严重的经济主义和工团主义思想，忽视对工人进行政治思想教育，对破坏劳动纪律的行为，没有进行应有的教育和必要的斗争，采取了尾巴主义的态度，所以，在许多具体问题上，反助长了工人劳动纪律松弛的现象。直到学习了中国工会第七次全国代表大会的文件后，我们才认识了自己的错误。
    这些错误，首先表现在对待行车肇事问题上。早在一九五一年，邵阳分公司（现改为邵阳总站）司机唐贵珍，曾因违反规章开快车，出事故两次。我们工会对他这种违反操作规程的行为，不进行教育，认为“他出了两次事故，以后不会再犯了”。但一九五二年二月，唐贵珍又在洪江翻车，重伤一人，轻伤八人，经洪江法院判刑两年。当时，群众思想很紊乱，有的说：“我们司机没有搞手了！”有的说：“人坐到驾驶室，班房门就打开在那里等。”在这种情况下，工会既不检查过去在处理这个问题上的错误，又不赶快抓紧澄清这些紊乱思想，反认为工会如不出面“援救”，会“脱离群众，影响生产”；同时，还认为唐贵珍虽是犯了错误，总是我们自己人，“援救”他正是“代表工人的利益”。于是，公开向群众表示说：“这个官司，工会负责打到底，大家放心。”随即向各级法院、省监委会、省总工会等机关去文，替唐贵珍“申冤”，和各机关公文往返达十五次之多。为了达到早日释放的目的，竟不惜钻法院判文上的空子，和法院对立起来。在工会内部，在处理肇事问题上，形成一套歪论调，即把法院对肇事犯的判刑说成是“惩办主义”；把事故伤亡说成是“劳动中的过失，生产中的差错”；用“教育为主”的名词来包庇某些不守法纪的人。最后，工会还索性另搞一套单行法规，即所谓“汽车肇事处理条例”，其中第九条第二款的规定是：“因生产上的特殊需要，经行政、工会保释，得改为缓刑，在工作中改造。”企图把缓刑权完全操在工会手里。这等于告诉职工，出了事故，可以不受国家法律的制裁（这个“法规”后来上级没有批准）。
    其次，在对待职工调派问题上，我们工会也是一贯采取尾巴主义的态度。一九五○年十二月安邵通车，需要派一组客车去安江，因为路线险峻一些，谁都不愿去。照理，工会应该配合行政说服一个组去担负这个任务。但工会不是这样做，而是迁就落后群众的意见，替他们主持抽签。签抽定了第一组去，但原先主张抽签的第一组的司机石隆，又不愿去了，并制造许多借口，一会说爱人要生小孩子，一会又说车子有毛病，并且大吵大闹。这时，工会还不教育石隆，反说这本是件“吃亏”的事，就去要求第一小组的工人迁就他，不要他去，小组不同意；工会又跟石隆去谈“价钱”，讲好话，答应他以后在长邵线上多跑几趟，多跑些里程，多挣些钱，另外还借给他四十万元，才算把问题解决。但是，自此以后，凡是山区险峻路线，就经常派不出车。有些车站的管理人员说：“目前最头痛的不是没有货运，而是有货派不出车。”
    由于我们一贯不注意教育工人，提高工人觉悟，反而迁就工人的落后思想，纵容工人不遵守劳动纪律，工人的错误行为便一天天发展，给国家经济建设事业造成了很大的损失。比如行车不遵守操作规程和安全制度，车子损坏率增大了，使运输局平均完好车率仅能达到百分之六十五，轮胎里程五月份最高仅达到定额的百分之八十五，超发四百二十一套（值十六亿八千四百万元），给财务计划、成本计划带来严重的威胁。事故也不断增加了，一九五二年第二季度，每十三万公里出一次事故，到今年第二季度，八万公里就出一次事故；单就赔偿损失、医疗抚恤费的支出，一月至五月份共计二千一百多万元。至于车辆停修的损失，起码要比这些支出大十倍。以上情况严重妨碍了运输企业的发展。
    学习了文件之后，我们初步认识了错误。赖若愚同志在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上说：“在国家建设时期，我们工会组织最重要最基本的任务，就是在中国共产党的领导下，联系并教育工人群众，不断地提高工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，巩固工农联盟，团结各阶层人民，积极地完成国家建设计划，并在发展生产的基础上，逐步地改善工人阶级和全体劳动人民的物质生活与文化生活，为逐步实现国家的工业化与过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。”我们过去的工作和这个指示有很大距离，我们长期存在尾巴主义与自由主义，没有以共产主义的精神去教育工人，提高工人群众的觉悟，把落后的提高到先进的水平上来，反而代表了工人的落后要求，使工人群众陷入经济主义与极端民主的泥潭，看不见社会主义的美好前途。
    赖主席又指示我们：“我们的国家是以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，我们国家的这个性质就规定了：我们国家的一切措施，归根结底都是为了提高和保护工人阶级以及全体劳动人民的物质和文化福利的。”然而，我们过去对这个问题的看法，是极端错误的。我们在处理行车肇事问题时，就认为法院不是保障工人阶级利益的，只有工会才是站在工人阶级的立场，代表工人阶级的利益，因此，出了事故，就和法院“打官司”。工资改革时，工人把行政作为斗争对象，没有严格批评工会，我们便沾沾自喜，反认为是过去“代表工人利益”的结果。
    过去的教训是沉痛的，我们必须挽回损失。我们要坚决贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会的精神和刘少奇同志的号召，在党的统一领导下，对全体职工进行一次劳动纪律教育。湖南省运输局及省公路运输工会决定按下面的步骤进行劳动纪律教育：
    一、结合总结上季度生产，检查劳动纪律松弛对国家计划的危害性及其产生的根源，同时，组织工会干部学习中国工会第七次全国代表大会和全省首届工会会员代表大会的文件及有关整顿劳动纪律的报纸社论，明确树立搞好生产思想，批判过去对待劳动纪律松弛现象所采取的尾巴主义倾向；
    二、在编制和发动群众讨论与修订第三季度计划和七月份作业计划的同时，深入进行调查，发现遵守劳动纪律的好典型，加以表扬，以树立榜样，带动群众；
    三、组织群众学习有关文件，引导群众开展批评与自我批评，检查与揭发劳动纪律松弛现象给国家带来的严重损害，进行自我教育。在群众自觉的基础上，发动群众把遵守劳动纪律订进爱国公约，成为爱国公约的重要内容之一。
