Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 9th: Our correspondent reports: The plenary session of both delegations will resume tomorrow morning. According to the suggestions of the Korean and Chinese sides, the plenary session of both delegations will discuss the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the preparatory work before the signing of the Armistice Agreement after the resumption.

Whether the U.S. side will guarantee that Syngman Rhee abides by the Armistice Agreement and all related agreements tomorrow is still unknown. However, as of today, Syngman Rhee has not given up his plan to undermine the armistice. This shows that if the U.S. side cannot make Syngman Rhee abide by the Armistice Agreement, the Korean armistice will inevitably be sabotaged.

Robertson and Clark, who flew to Seoul from Tokyo this morning, held another meeting with Syngman Rhee today. After returning to Tokyo in the afternoon, Clark said: "The United Nations Command intends to proceed with the armistice negotiations directly." On Syngman Rhee's side, a South Korean "senior official" told the Associated Press reporter tonight: Syngman Rhee "still insists on opposing the armistice, despite the U.S. suggestion to conclude a military security treaty, provide 'substantial' economic assistance, and re-equip four South Korean divisions." Syngman Rhee's henchmen are continuing to threaten to undermine the armistice. Choi Duk-shin, a South Korean representative who participated in the Panmunjom negotiations, threatened today that "Syngman Rhee believes that South Korea has a responsibility to refuse to sign the Armistice Agreement." He also said that his words were fully agreed upon by Syngman Rhee. South Korean Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai also declared yesterday that if there is an order from Syngman Rhee, "Korean troops will not withdraw from the front line after the armistice." He also cited Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war as an example to make people believe that Syngman Rhee would do such a thing. Syngman Rhee is obviously making a final struggle to obtain guarantees from the United States to restart the war before the armistice is realized.

The United States is continuing to condone and encourage Syngman Rhee's stubborn attitude. American officers in Tokyo continue to claim, "If Syngman Rhee decides to stick to his current attitude, we can't do anything about it." At the same time, news from Washington even said that the United States is preparing to ask Britain and France to also participate in "some form of security guarantee" to South Korea in order to satisfy Syngman Rhee. This means that Britain and France should also participate in the U.S.-Syngman Rhee military alliance, and tie the British and French people together with the American people to Syngman Rhee's broken chariot. The U.S. government's approach can only increase Syngman Rhee's capital to undermine the armistice, making him more daring to unscrupulously undermine the armistice.

The Korean Armistice Agreement is almost ready for signing. Clark said that the U.S. is prepared to proceed with negotiations "directly." People cannot help but ask: What effective measures is the U.S. prepared to take to ensure that the Armistice Agreement will not be undermined by Syngman Rhee? This is a question that U.S. negotiator Harrison must answer in the negotiation tent in Panmunjom tomorrow.

### 李承晚继续叫嚣要破坏朝鲜停战  试问美方将采取什么有效措施保证停战协定的实施

    李承晚继续叫嚣要破坏朝鲜停战
    试问美方将采取什么有效措施保证停战协定的实施
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者报道：双方代表团大会将在明天上午复会。根据朝中方面的建议，在复会以后的双方代表团大会上，将要商谈有关朝鲜停战协定的实施问题和停战协定签字前的准备工作问题。
    美方明天是否将保证李承晚遵守停战协定及其一切有关协议，现在还不知道。但是到今天为止，李承晚还没有放弃破坏停战的打算。这说明如果美方不能使李承晚遵守停战协定，那末朝鲜停战将必然要遭受破坏。
    罗伯逊和今天上午从东京飞到汉城的克拉克今天又去和李承晚举行会谈。克拉克在下午回到东京后说：“联合国军方面打算迳自进行停战谈判。”而在李承晚方面呢，一位南朝鲜“高级人士”今夜告诉美联社记者说：李承晚“仍然坚持反对停战，尽管美国建议订立军事安全条约，提供‘大量的’经济援助并且再装备四个韩国师”。李承晚的爪牙们正继续要挟破坏停战。曾参加板门店谈判的南朝鲜代表崔德新今天恫吓说，“李承晚认为南朝鲜有责任拒绝在停战协定上签字。”他并且说，他的话是得到李承晚的完全同意的。李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰在昨天也宣称，如果有李承晚的命令，“朝鲜军队在停战以后不会从前线撤退”。他还以李承晚“释放”战俘事件为例，叫人相信李承晚会干出这一手来的。李承晚显然要作最后的挣扎，来在停战实现以前从美国取得重新发动战争的保证。
    对于李承晚这种死硬态度，美国方面正在继续加以纵容和鼓励。在东京的美国军官继续宣称，“如果李承晚决定坚持他目前的态度，我们是无可奈何的。”同时，从华盛顿传出的消息甚至还说，美国准备要求英国和法国也参加给南朝鲜的“某种形式的安全保障”，以便使李承晚感到满意。这就是说，要英国和法国也参加美、李军事同盟，把英国和法国人民，跟美国人民一起缚在李承晚的破烂战车上。美国政府这样的做法显然只能增加李承晚破坏停战的本钱，使他更加敢于肆无忌惮地破坏停战。
    朝鲜停战协定差不多只待签字了。克拉克说美方准备“迳自”进行谈判。人们不免要问：美方准备采取什么有效的措施，来保证停战协定不致遭受李承晚的破坏呢？这是美方谈判代表哈利逊明天在板门店的谈判帐篷里必须回答的问题。
