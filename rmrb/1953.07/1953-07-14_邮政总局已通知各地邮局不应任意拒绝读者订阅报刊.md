The General Post Office Has Notified Local Post Offices That They Should Not Arbitrarily Refuse Readers to Subscribe to Newspapers and Magazines

    Letter from the General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government: Since the first quarter of this year, local post and telecommunications bureaus have often refused readers to subscribe to newspapers and magazines due to issues such as newspaper and magazine quotas and subscription times not being properly resolved, causing dissatisfaction and criticism from readers. In response to this, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications successively issued notices in late May: the vast majority of newspapers and magazines—especially the Beijing edition newspapers and magazines—can be subscribed to in excess of the quota, without being subject to quota restrictions; readers who have missed the newspaper and magazine subscription period should still be allowed to subscribe by using the method of partial month subscriptions for newspapers and partial quarter subscriptions for magazines, with cutoffs at the end of the month or quarter, in order to meet readers' needs for cultural nourishment.

    Recently, many readers have continued to write letters reflecting that they cannot subscribe to newspapers or magazines at their local post and telecommunications bureaus. The "Reader's Letters Summary" column of the People's Daily published quite a few readers' letters on July 1st and other occasions, which shows that we have not yet solved this problem very well. We have notified the relevant provincial postal and telecommunications administrations to inspect and deal with the situations reflected in the readers' letters, and to strengthen education and inspection of the postal and telecommunications bureaus under their jurisdiction, requiring that similar situations no longer occur.

    邮政总局已通知各地邮局不应任意拒绝读者订阅报刊
    中央人民政府邮电部邮政总局来信：自今年第一季度起，由于报刊定额和收订时间等问题尚未获得适当解决，各地邮电局常有拒绝读者订阅报刊的情况，引起读者的不满和责难。针对这点，邮电部已于五月下旬连续发出通知：绝大部分报刊——特别是北京版报刊可以超额收订，不受定额限制；对错过报刊收订期的读者仍得采取报纸破月、杂志破季，月底或季底截齐的办法进行收订，以满足读者对文化食粮的需要。
    近来仍有不少读者来信反映在当地邮电局订不到报纸或杂志的情况。人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏在七月一日等两次发表的不少读者来信，就说明我们对这问题还没有很好的解决。我们已通知有关各省的邮电管理局对读者来信中所反映的情况加以检查处理，并对所辖各邮电局加强教育检查，要求不再有类似情况发生。
