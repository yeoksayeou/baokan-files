    Liaoxi Iron Factory Should Improve Water Wheel Quality

    Liu Zizhen of the Central Ministry of Water Resources Irrigation Bureau writes: Recently, I went to Liaoxi Province and Rehe Province to understand the situation of farmland water conservancy work. I found that farmers in the above two provinces have many opinions on the water wheels produced by Liaoxi Iron Factory. They compared the water wheels produced by the factory with the water wheels produced by Shanxi Machinery Factory: The quality of the factory's water wheels is not good, the large gears often break, and they are not as durable as the water wheels of Shanxi Machinery Factory; the factory's water wheels do not come with installation tools, making installation inconvenient, while the water wheels of Shanxi Machinery Factory come with two wrenches and a drift pin; the factory's water wheels are more expensive, costing 1.63 million yuan per unit, while the water wheels of Shanxi Machinery Factory cost only 1.5 million yuan per unit. According to incomplete statistics from four counties in Rehe Province, namely Chengde, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, and Beipiao, seventeen large gears have already broken in the water wheels purchased by farmers from Liaoxi Iron Factory. After these water wheels are broken, they become useless because there is no place to repair them. This not only causes great losses to farmers but also directly affects this year's production. It is hoped that the factory can examine the problems in production, improve product quality, and find ways to repair the damaged water wheels for the farmers.

    辽西铁工厂应改进水车质量
    中央水利部灌溉总局刘自箴来信：最近我到辽西省和热河省了解农田水利工作的情况时，发现上述两省农民对辽西铁工厂出品的水车很有意见。他们拿该厂出产的水车和山西机器厂出产的水车来比较：该厂水车质量不好，大牙轮常断，不如山西机器厂的水车结实；该厂的水车没有附带装修工具，安装不便，山西机器厂的水车却带有两个搬子，一个解锥；该厂水车价格较贵，每架要一百六十三万元，山西机器厂的水车每架只要一百五十万元。据热河省承德、凌源、朝阳、北票等四个县不完全统计，农民购置的辽西铁工厂的水车中已有十七台大牙轮断了。这些水车坏后因为没处可修，就成了废物。这不但使农民受到很大损失，也直接影响了今年的生产。希望该厂能够检查生产中的问题，改进产品质量，并且设法为农民整修已损坏的水车。
