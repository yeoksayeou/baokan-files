    The Victory of the Korean and Chinese People's Anti-Aggression War
    Demonstrates the Immense Power of Peace
    Letter from the Beijing Medical College Correspondence Group: When the faculty and students of our school heard the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, they were very excited. Everyone believes that this is a great victory for the just war of the Korean and Chinese people against aggression and in defense of peace, and a tremendous victory for the people of the world in their struggle for peace. This is because the Korean and Chinese people possess an invincible force, because the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is incomparably powerful, and because the peace-loving people of the world have demonstrated immense peaceful power. This shows that our strength is growing stronger and stronger, and that we have the people of the world as our backing; all military adventures by imperialist warmongers are bound to fail. However, the full implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement is not without obstacles. The possibility of the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique sabotaging the armistice agreement still exists, and the US side's guarantee for the full implementation of the armistice agreement remains to be proven by facts. To resolutely ensure the realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to facilitate a further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, we must heighten our vigilance and prevent any activities by the other side to sabotage the armistice. We, the Korean and Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, are fully prepared and have sufficient strength to inflict devastating blows on any warmongers who dare to sabotage the armistice agreement.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    朝中人民反侵略战争的胜利
    显示了和平力量的无比强大
    北京医学院通讯组来信：当我们学校的教员和学生们听到关于朝鲜停战协定签字的消息时，都很兴奋。大家认为：这是朝中人民抵抗侵略、保卫和平的正义战争的伟大胜利，是全世界人民争取和平斗争的巨大胜利。这是由于朝中人民具有着不可战胜的力量，是由于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的无比强大，是由于全世界爱好和平的人民显示了巨大的和平威力。这说明：我们的力量愈来愈强大了，我们有全世界人民为后盾；帝国主义好战分子的一切军事冒险行动，是必定会遭到失败的。但是，朝鲜停战协定的完全实施并不是没有阻碍的。李承晚反动集团破坏停战协定的可能仍然存在，美国方面对全面实施停战协定的保证尚待事实证明。要坚决保证朝鲜停战协定的实现，并有利于进一步和平解决朝鲜问题，我们必须提高警惕，防止对方的任何破坏停战的活动。我们朝中人民和全世界爱好和平的人民有充分准备和足够力量，会给任何胆敢破坏停战协定的好战分子以毁灭性的打击。
