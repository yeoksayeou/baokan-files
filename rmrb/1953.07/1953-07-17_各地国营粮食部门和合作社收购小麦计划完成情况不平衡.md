Within the past two months, the national wheat procurement plan has been completed on schedule. June was the peak period for wheat entering the market, with the national monthly plan being completed at 151.46%. However, the completion of the plan varies greatly from region to region. Provinces with higher completion rates include Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other non-major wheat-producing provinces. However, in major wheat-producing provinces, especially Shaanxi, which had a bumper harvest this year, and Hebei and Shanxi, which had average harvests, the procurement plans have not yet been completed. The proportion of procurement by state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in these areas is very small compared to the amount of wheat entering the market. By the end of June, the procurement volume in 18 counties of the Weinan Special District in Shaanxi only accounted for 54.3%. Although Shandong and Henan provinces over-fulfilled their procurement plans in June, judging from the trend of wheat entering the market, they have not yet reached the expected peak.

Historically, the pattern of wheat entering the market in China's wheat-producing areas is roughly as follows: starting at the end of May, peaking in June, reaching its highest point in July, and declining after August. The procurement work reaches its peak successively from the southern to the central and then to the northern regions, continuing for more than four months across the country. Currently, the amount of wheat entering the market in the Yangtze River basin and provinces south of the Yangtze River is gradually decreasing, and some are about to pass the procurement season. In July, the focus of wheat procurement should be in the central regions of Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi. However, judging from the current wheat procurement situation in these regions, great efforts should be made in the coming period to continue to complete and strive to over-fulfill the procurement plans.

### 各地国营粮食部门和合作社收购小麦计划完成情况不平衡

    各地国营粮食部门和合作社收购小麦计划完成情况不平衡
    过去两个月内，全国收购小麦的计划都已按期完成，六月份是小麦上市的高潮期，全国完成月计划百分之一百五十一点四六。但是各地完成计划的情况很不平衡。完成计划较多的是四川、浙江、江苏、江西、湖北等非主要产麦省份。但在主要产麦省份，特别是今年丰收的陕西和有一般年成的河北、山西等地，还没有完成收购计划。国营粮食部门和合作社在这些地区的收购量占上市量的比重很小；六月底，陕西渭南专区十八个县份的收购量只占百分之五十四点三；山东和河南省虽在六月份超额完成了收购计划，但从小麦上市的趋势上看，还没有达到应有的高潮。
    历年来我国小麦产区上市的规律，大致是起于五月底，盛于六月，七月达最高峰，八月以后上市趋减，收购工作从南部到中部再到北部接连达到高潮，在全国延续四个多月。目前，长江流域及长江流域以南各省小麦上市量逐渐下降，有的将过收购季节，七月份收购小麦的重点应在中部地区山东、陕西、河南、河北、山西等地，但从这些地区目前小麦收购情况看来，今后一个时期应作极大努力，继续完成并争取超额完成收购计划。    （据新华社讯）
