    Strive to Do a Good Job in Production and Teach Young Workers Well
    Sheng Junqing, Technician of Wuhan Xin Sheng Machinery Factory
    I am a worker who lived through the old society, and I don't know how much oppression I suffered before. I started as an apprentice at the age of thirteen, working eighteen hours a day, and was often beaten and scolded. After three years of apprenticeship, I didn't get paid and helped the boss for another year. I have worked for more than thirty years, but I was always underfed and poorly clothed. It wasn't until after liberation that I finally turned over. I no longer work for capitalists to make a living as I did in the past. Although I am still working in a private factory, everything I produce is used for national construction because our factory is now repairing and processing for state-owned factories. I always think that if a machine is not made well, it will not only lose the factory's reputation and affect business, but most importantly, it will cause losses to the country. If the machine cannot be delivered on time, or it is not useful after it is taken out, it will make the country's production plan impossible to complete. Because I have this idea in mind, I always use as much strength as possible when I work. In the factory for several years, I have never been absent from work. When repairing machines on ships outside, I always don't come back until the work is finished. The factory eats at 5:30, and I have often finished my work hungry and returned to the factory at 8 or 9 o'clock to eat. Once, the factory sent me to Xinyang to install a machine. When I got there, it was inconvenient to eat and sleep, and it was really unbearable, but when I thought about installing a rice milling machine to supply the people with rice, and that the machine would affect the people's lives if it was not installed on time, I completed the work regardless of all difficulties. When there was no place to sleep, I slept on straw; when there was no place to eat, I bought food outside. After working like this for a month and two days, I finally installed the machine. Another time I went to Anlu County, Hubei Province, to install a diesel engine. That machine milled rice during the day and generated electricity at night, which the people needed for eating and lighting. When I arrived, I tried my best to rush the work, and I stayed up for three nights in a row. Because I was too tired, my foot was injured, but later I still worked with crutches for more than twenty days and rushed to install the machine.
    In addition to working hard myself, I also take good care of the young workers and try to teach them skills. When I go out to repair ships with the young workers, I help them when they move the eyebolts. When they lift the iron core, I help them because I see that the objects are too heavy and I am afraid of twisting their waists. When working on the ship, the young workers don't understand the principle of the steam engine, so I use the principle of boiling water on the stove to explain it to them, and explain the performance of the machine clearly. I believe that the young generation of today is the treasure of the country. We have experience, but our strength is poor. We must teach them the skills to build the country well, so that I can contribute to the construction of the country.

    努力搞好生产教好青工
    武汉新生机器厂技工  盛钧庆
    我是从旧社会里活出来的一个工人，以前不晓得受了多少压迫。我十三岁开始当学徒，一天做十八个钟头的工，时常挨打挨骂。当了三年学徒，出师之后，又不拿工钱白帮了老板一年。我一共做了三十几年的工，总是吃不饱穿不暖，到解放之后才算翻了身。我再不像从前那样在资本家的压迫下做工混饭吃了，虽说现在还是在私营厂里干，但干出的活，样样都是用在国家的建设上，因为我们厂里现在做的活都是代国营工厂修理加工。我总是想着，一部机器要是做得不好，不光是失了厂里的信用，影响营业，顶要紧的还是给国家造成了损失，因为机器不能按时候交出去，或者是拿出去不顶用，那都要使得国家的生产计划不能完成。因为我抱着这样的想法，所以平常干活的时候总是有多大的力量用多大的力量。在厂里几年，我没有旷过一回工，在外边修船上的机器的时候，总是活不做完不回来，厂里五点半钟吃饭，我好多次都是饿着肚子把活搞完了到八九点钟才回厂吃饭。有一回，厂里派我到信阳去安装一部机器。到了那里，吃饭睡觉都不方便，真是待不下去，但是我想到装的是供应人民吃米的碾米机，机器不按时装好，就要影响人民的生活时，我就不顾一切困难来完成工作。没地方睡，我就睡在稻草上，没有地方吃饭，就在外面买着吃，这样干了一个月零两天，终于把机器装好了。又一回到湖北省安陆县去装一部柴油机，那部机器白天里碾米，晚上带着发电，人民吃饭和点灯都需要它。我去了就尽力赶工，连熬了三个夜，因为太疲倦了脚被打了，但是后来还是扶着拐棍干了二十几天的活，赶着把机器装好了。
    除了自己努力干活外，对于青工，我也很爱护，并且尽量教给他们技术。和青工们一起出去修船的时候，他们搬眼子，我就给他们帮忙，他们抬铁心子，我看见东西太重了怕扭了他们的腰，就帮着去抬。在船上做活的时候，青工不懂得蒸气机的道理，我就把炉子上烧开水的道理比喻着讲给他们听，说清楚机器的性能。我认为今天青年的一代是国家的宝贝，我们经验是有，但是气力差了，要好好地把建设国家的本领教给他们，我才算对国家的建设出了一分力。
