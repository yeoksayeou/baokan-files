    Let the Spirit of Negotiation Triumph Over Force
    ——A Record of the World Peace Council Budapest Meeting
    Yan Biao
    We arrived in Budapest from the Soviet Union by plane on June 13th. Hungarians often say that Budapest is a microcosm of the whole of Hungary, a symbol of the whole of Hungary. One cannot truly appreciate the meaning of this sentence without having been to Budapest. Indeed, Budapest contains so many things that the Hungarian people are proud of: the Buda hills with the Statue of Liberty towering over them, the neat Pest city area and its architecture reflecting the Hungarian national style, and finally the Danube River, which the Hungarian people cherish most, and the Margaret Island, like a pearl inlaid on the river. Budapest is indeed a beautiful city, but more importantly, it is a city of labor and peace. After seven or eight years of hard work by the Hungarian people, this city, which was so severely damaged by Nazi Germany, shows no signs of war wounds today. People who are dedicated to building their own country are also bound to be peace-loving people. For the Hungarians, "Béke" (peace) has become as common a word in their lives as "Szabadság" (freedom). The representatives who participated in the World Peace Council were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Hungarian people as soon as they arrived in Budapest. No matter where your car drove, you would always encounter groups of Budapest residents smiling and waving at you, and young people and children vying to greet you and ask for your autograph. I believe that everyone who participated in the meeting would unhesitatingly admit that the success of this meeting was inseparable from the friendship and labor of the Hungarians.

    The meeting officially began on June 15th. Three hundred and ninety delegates attended. Including the delegates who arrived later, a total of 403 people participated in the meeting. The composition of the delegates was very broad: there were old warriors such as Tikhonov, Guo Moruo, Ehrenburg, and Mrs. Gordon, who have been fighting for the cause of peace for many years, as well as specially invited representatives who have not had direct contact with the World Peace Council; there were metalworkers such as Czech representative Bouček, as well as religious figures such as Pastor Niemöller and Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Saranankara, and old soldiers such as General Harra; there were communists, as well as British Labor Party members and Indian National Congress members. American delegates, including white and black people, also attended the meeting. Different religious beliefs and political views did not prevent these peace-loving people from gathering together to discuss issues of common concern to the people of all countries - peace. Their high degree of unity became a clear characteristic that ran through the meeting. Germans, Japanese, and Indians all pledged at the meeting that their people would never fight against the people of other countries, especially the people of the Soviet Union and China. When American delegate Mrs. Morgan stated that the cause of the American people was united with the cause of the people fighting for peace all over the world, the entire audience responded with warm applause. This spirit of unity was also manifested in the unanimous adoption of the meeting's declaration and various resolutions. Whether in the subcommittees or in the plenary sessions, these declarations and resolutions were passed completely unanimously, without
    a single vote against, without a single abstention.
    This meeting was convened under new circumstances. This new situation is that the idea of peace and consultation is gaining more and more support from the masses, and new hopes for easing international tensions have emerged. The greatest achievement of this meeting lies in the fact that it passed the World Peace Council Declaration and the Declaration on Launching a World Movement for Peace, thereby prescribing a program of action for the current peace struggle of the people of all countries. In these two declarations, the meeting accurately assessed the current situation, pointing out that "great hope has emerged. Now everyone sees that agreement is possible. The slaughter can end. The 'Cold War' can be stopped." It called on the people of all countries to launch a broad movement for consultation, demanding that their governments consult and reach agreements. On the other hand, the meeting also pointed out in the course of its discussions that the road to peace is difficult and tortuous, and it cannot be assumed that international disputes can be resolved completely overnight. Ehrenburg put it well,
    "Only simple-minded people would imagine that mankind could just wake up and look up to see a completely agreed-upon, cloudless sky." As Chinese delegate Guo Moruo pointed out, "There are many major and complex issues that must be resolved. It would be wrong and unrealistic to force others to accept preconditions for reaching agreement, or to attempt to resolve all of these issues at once. Only through consultations among major powers,
    resolving some of the outstanding issues one by one, can we effectively
    and practically gradually lead to the easing of the international situation and the elimination of the threat of war." As D'Astier said in his opening remarks, we have no preconditions, consultation has no ready-made methods or absolute rules, and we welcome any initiatives and negotiations to achieve this goal. In fact, any progress in resolving current international disputes, especially in resolving the most acute current issues such as the Korean issue or the German issue, will inevitably reduce the threat of war, thereby facilitating a comprehensive peaceful settlement.

    It is for this reason that the meeting warmly welcomed the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war by the two sides in the Korean negotiations, and earnestly hoped that the Korean armistice would be realized. The meeting's declaration stated: "The Korean armistice is the prelude to peace. The Korean armistice agreement must be signed immediately on the basis of the agreements already reached." This precisely represents the most urgent expectation of the people of all countries in the world. The respect and honor that the Chinese and Korean delegates received at the meeting was precisely the high esteem that the people of all countries expressed for the peaceful efforts of the Chinese and Korean people.

    In addition to the Korean issue, the meeting's declaration also called for a halt to all existing wars, the promotion of the peaceful reunification of Germany, the restoration of Japanese sovereignty, the development of economic and cultural exchanges between countries, and the adherence of the United Nations to the United Nations Charter, and so on.
    However, warmongers are afraid of peace, and they are using all their might to oppose the peaceful resolution of international disputes through consultation. Ehrenburg correctly pointed out in his speech: "The forces of war do not feel that they have completely failed at all, but only consider the imminent armistice in Korea as their first major setback. They have not given up, and still hope to recoup their losses elsewhere. ... Of course, I don't want to exaggerate anything, but it would be naive to close our eyes to the desperate struggle of those who want war - cold war or hot war." Ehrenburg also pointed out: "Let us not indulge in the preliminary victories of peace, in mutual congratulations and cheers, and in singing hymns of praise." Ehrenburg is right, peace-loving people must not be satisfied with the achievements they have already made, and slacken our efforts. In fact, the forces of war are already taking extreme actions to get rid of their so-called "peace crisis." The South Korean Syngman Rhee clique, with the connivance of the United States, forcibly detained prisoners of war; the US government is playing the conspiracy of concluding a "common defense treaty" with South Korea; the Adenauer government, under the instigation of the United States, carried out provocative actions in Berlin; on the last day of the World Peace Council meeting, the delegates learned with deep grief and anger of the illegal execution of peace fighters the Rosenbergs. All of this requires us to tirelessly raise our vigilance and further strengthen the struggle for peace. It is also for this reason that the call in the meeting's declaration that "we all have a responsibility to support every action to resolve disputes peacefully, regardless of which government such action may come from. We have a responsibility to frustrate the activities of those who obstruct and delay agreements" has particularly great significance.

    Another major achievement of this meeting was: reviewing the past achievements of the World Peace Council, clarifying the guiding principles and tasks of the World Peace Council, and expanding its understanding to make it more representative. In order to implement the program of action for the peace movement stipulated by this meeting under the new situation, it is necessary to further expand the ranks of peace, unite more forces, and fight for peace. In this regard, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to "attract those who, under the influence of recent events, have begun to realize that consultations must be carried out and that consultations are possible to participate in the actions to defend peace." At the same time, in order to fight more effectively, it is necessary to better organize the ranks of peace. In view of this, the meeting clearly stipulated that the task of the World Peace Council is to maintain constant and close contact with the peace forces of all countries and to inform them of major events in the world at any time. The World Peace Council has the responsibility to propose ways to strive for peace that should be adopted worldwide, but does not replace the peace struggles of the people of all countries, nor does it require the people of all countries to act in the same way. According to the new situation and tasks, the meeting also decided to expand the organization of the Council and include 129 representative figures from various countries who have not yet participated in the World Peace Council. As D'Astier said, "The composition of the World Peace Council, its gradual becoming universal, its past activities, the prestige brought to it by its achievements, its influence on the development of the situation, all of this proves that it is capable of completing its tasks."

    The meeting also passed a resolution on promoting cultural exchanges and decided to award peace prizes and medals to 22 cultural and scientific workers who have made outstanding contributions to the cause of peace. There is no doubt that this will greatly enhance mutual understanding and trust among the people of all countries, thereby facilitating the development of the consultation movement.

    The World Peace Council Budapest meeting has successfully completed its work. As the delegates are returning to their respective countries to work for the implementation of the declaration and resolutions of this meeting today, I would like to once again recall a moving scene at the last day of the meeting - the offering of flowers by Hungarian children. I believe that everyone present will never forget the infinite and enthusiastic expectations that the children expressed for them. Ehrenburg said near the end of his speech: "We must work harder to strive for peace, so that none of us will feel ashamed and blush when he sees his little child in Budapest, London, Moscow or New York." Ehrenburg's words should become the common determination of all peace-loving people.

    让协商的精神战胜武力
    ——记世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议
    言彪
    我们在六月十三日从苏联乘飞机到达了布达佩斯。匈牙利人常说，布达佩斯是整个匈牙利的缩影，是整个匈牙利的象征。没有到过布达佩斯的人，是无法体会到这句话的意义的。的确，布达佩斯包含了那样多匈牙利人民所引为自豪的东西：耸立着自由神像的布达山麓，整洁的佩斯市区及它那反映着匈牙利民族风格的建筑，最后还有匈牙利人民所最珍视的多瑙河和像珍珠一样嵌在河上的马尔基特岛。布达佩斯的确是一座美丽的城市，然而更重要的它是一座劳动的、和平的城市。经过匈牙利人民七八年来的辛勤劳动，这座曾经被纳粹德国破坏得那样厉害的城市，今天已经看不出什么战争的创伤了。埋头建设自己国家的人们，也必然是爱好和平的人们。对于匈牙利人来说，“别凯”（和平）已经和“萨巴查”（自由）一样，成为生活中最常用的字眼了。参加世界和平理事会的代表们一到布达佩斯，就受到了匈牙利人民的热烈欢迎和殷勤招待。不管你的车子开到那里，总会遇到一群群的布达佩斯的居民向你含笑招手，青年和儿童争着向你致意，请你签名。我相信每一个参加会议的人都会毫不犹豫地承认，这次会议的成功是和匈牙利人的友情和劳动分不开的。
    会议在六月十五日正式开始。到会代表三百九十人。如果加上后来赶到的代表，共有四百零三人参加了这次会议。代表们的成分是十分广泛的：有吉洪诺夫、郭沫若、爱伦堡、戈登夫人这些为和平事业奋斗多年的老战士，也有一直没有和世界和平理事会发生过直接关系的特邀代表们；有像捷克斯洛伐克代表鲍契克这样的五金工人，也有像尼穆勒牧师和锡兰佛教法师撒拉南卡拉这样的宗教界人士，也有像哈拉将军这样的老军人；有共产党员，也有英国的工党党员和印度的国大党员。包括白人和黑人在内的美国代表也出席了这次会议。不同的宗教信仰和政治见解并没有阻止这些爱好和平的人们聚首一堂，来讨论各国人民所共同关心的问题——和平。他们之间的高度的团结一致，成了贯穿这次会议的一个明显的特征。德国人、日本人和印度人都在会上保证，他们的人民决不对其他国家的人民、特别是苏联和中国的人民作战。当美国代表摩根夫人表示美国人民的事业是和全世界为和平而斗争的人民的事业结合在一起时，全场报以热烈的鼓掌。这种团结的精神，还表现在一致通过会议的宣言和各项决议上面，无论在小组委员会上还是在全体会议上，这些宣言和决议都是完全一致通过的，没有
    一票反对，没有一票弃权。
    这次会议是在新的形势之下召开的。这个新的形势就是和平和协商的思想正在掌握着越来越多的群众，缓和国际紧张局势出现了新的希望。这次会议的最大成就，在于它通过了世界和平理事会宣言和展开世界争取和平运动的宣言，从而给各国人民当前的和平斗争规定了行动纲领。会议在这两个宣言中确切地估计了当前的形势，指出“很大的希望已经出现了。现在每个人都看到协议是可能的。屠杀能够结束。‘冷战’能够制止。”并号召各国人民广泛开展争取协商的运动，要求他们的政府进行协商和达成协议。另一方面，会议也在讨论过程中指出了通往和平的道路是困难曲折的，不能设想国际争端能在一朝一夕全部解决。爱伦堡说得好，
    “只有头脑简单的人才会设想人类刚一醒来就能抬头看到完全协议的万里无云的天空”。正如中国代表郭沫若所指出的“必须解决的重大问题是很多很复杂的。要强迫别人接受取得协议的先决条件，或企图一下子把所有这些问题都全部解决，都会是错误的和不切合实际的。只有通过大国协商的方式，
    对悬而未决的一些问题逐个地加以解决，才能有效
    而实际地逐步导致国际局势的和缓和战争威胁的解
    除。”正如达斯迪埃在开幕词里所讲的，我们并没有先决条件，协商并没有现成的方式和绝对的成规，任何为达到这一目标的倡议和谈判，我们都是欢迎的。事实上在解决当前国际争端方面，特别是解决像朝鲜问题或德国问题这一类当前最尖锐的问题方面的任何进展，都必将减少战争的威胁，从而有利于全面的和平解决。
    正是因为这个缘故，会议热烈欢迎朝鲜谈判双方签订关于战俘遣返问题的协议，并热望朝鲜停战实现。会议的宣言中指出：“朝鲜停战是和平的序幕。必须在已经达成的协议的基础上立即签订朝鲜停战协定。”这正是代表了世界各国人民的最迫切的期望。而中国代表和朝鲜代表在会议上所受到的尊重和荣誉，也正是世界各国人民对于中朝人民和平努力所表示的崇高敬意。
    除了朝鲜问题以外，会议的宣言还号召停止一切现有战争，促成德国和平统一，恢复日本主权，发展各国间经济与文化的交流，使联合国忠实于联合国宪章等等。
    但是好战分子是害怕和平的，他们正在用尽一切力量反对以协商方式解决国际争端。爱伦堡在他的发言里正确地指出：“战争力量根本没有觉得他们已经完全失败，而只认为朝鲜即将停战是他们第一个巨大的挫折。它们还没有死心，还希望在其他地方捞回它的损失。……当然我不愿意夸张任何事情，但是闭起眼睛不看要战争——冷战或热战——的人的拼命挣扎，那也是幼稚的。”爱伦堡还指出：“我们不要使自己沉湎于和平的初步胜利，沉湎于相互道贺欢呼和唱赞美诗。”爱伦堡的话是对的，爱好和平的人们切不可满足于已得的成就，而松弛我们的努力。事实上战争势力已经在采取极端行动来摆脱他们所谓的“和平危机”了。南朝鲜李承晚集团在美方纵容下强迫扣留战俘的事件，美国政府正在玩弄与南朝鲜缔结“共同防御条约”的阴谋，阿登纳政府在美国指使下在柏林进行挑衅的行动，在世界和平理事会最后一天会议上代表们以深深的悲痛和愤怒获悉了和平战士罗森堡夫妇被非法处死的消息，所有这一切都要求我们不倦地提高警惕，进一步加强争取和平的斗争。也正是因为这个缘故，会议的宣言中所号召的“我们大家有责任支持用和平方式解决争端的每一个行动，不管这种行动可能来自那个政府。我们有责任挫败那些阻挠并拖延协议的人的活动”，就有着特别重大的意义。
    这次会议的另一个重大成就是：检阅了世界和平理事会的已往成就，明确了世界和平理事会的方针任务，并扩大了它的认识，使之具有更大的代表性，为了在新的形势下实现这次会议为和平运动所规定的行动纲领，就必须更加扩大和平的队伍，团结更多的力量，为和平而斗争。会议在这方面指出，必须“吸引那些在最近事件的影响下开始认识到必须进行协商和有可能进行协商的人们参加保卫和平的行动”。同时为了更有效地战斗，就必须把和平的队伍更好地组织起来。有鉴于此，这次会议明确规定了世界和平理事会的任务就是与各国和平力量保持经常密切的联系，随时把世界上的大事告诉他们。世界和平理事会有责任提出世界范围内应该采取的争取和平的方式，但不代替各国人民的和平斗争，也不要求各国人民用同样的方式活动。根据新的形势和任务，这次会议还决定扩大理事会的组织，把各国迄今没有参加世界和平理事会的一百二十九位具有代表性的人物包括进来。正如达斯迪埃所说的，“世界和平理事会的成分，它的逐渐成为世界性，它的以往的活动，它的成就给它带来的威望，它对事态发展的影响，所有这一切都证明了它是能够完成它的任务的。”
    这次会议还通过了关于促进文化交流的决议，并决定将和平奖金和奖章授给二十二位对和平事业有卓越贡献的文化、科学工作者。毫无疑问，这必将大大增进各国人民之间的相互了解和信任，从而有利于协商运动的展开。
    世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议已经胜利地完成了它的工作。当代表们正在返回他们各自的国家为实现这次会议的宣言和决议而努力的今天，我愿再次提起最后一天会议上一个动人的场面——匈牙利儿童的献花。我相信所有在场的人都永不会忘记孩子们对于他们所表示的无限热烈的期望。爱伦堡在快要结束他的发言时曾经说：“我们要更努力地来争取和平，使我们中间没有一个人在看到在布达佩斯、伦敦、莫斯科或纽约的他的小孩子的时候，会感到惭愧而脸红起来。”爱伦堡的这句话应该成为一切爱好和平人们的共同决心。
