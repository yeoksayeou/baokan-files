Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: According to TASS reports: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other countries have successively commented on the Soviet "Truth" editorial of July 23rd, "What the Washington Conference Tells Us."

	"Neues Deutschland" editorial emphasized: The Soviet Union is genuinely striving for a peaceful resolution of the German question in accordance with the vital interests of all German people, while Washington and Bonn are undermining all proposals for a genuine resolution of this issue. The participants of the Washington Conference only hoped to divide Germany and incorporate West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic Group.

	The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial titled "Striving for the Victory of the Thought of Negotiation," saying: The result of the Soviet peace initiative has created the possibility of easing international tensions. The Soviet peace initiative has been warmly welcomed by people all over the world, and even supported by many bourgeois political leaders. The result of the Korean armistice negotiations once again shows the world that no issue (even the most complex one) cannot be resolved through peaceful negotiations and agreements by the parties concerned. In this context, all those who sincerely and faithfully strive to ease international tensions are very disappointed with the results and communique of the Washington Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain and France.

	The Czechoslovak "Red Right Daily" published an editorial titled "The Strength of Soviet Peace Policy," saying: "The 'Truth' editorial critically analyzed the Washington Conference communique, pointing out that the Foreign Ministers' Conference without Soviet representatives did not bring the resolution of any of the most acute international issues any closer."

	The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" published an editorial saying: "The 'Truth' editorial rightly pointed out that the Western Three Foreign Ministers Conference itself means disregard for basic international rules and international law. It is very clear that those who are willing to engage in truly effective negotiations with other governments will not conspire behind the backs of those governments, nor will they put forward unilaterally formulated conditions. The Washington Conference proves that the important task at present is to eliminate obstacles that hinder the resolution of major international disputes through consultation."

Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: According to TASS Paris, 27th Dispatch: All French newspapers have published summaries of the "Truth" editorial of July 23rd: "What the Washington Conference Tells Us." "L'Humanité" reprinted the full text of the editorial.

	Pierre Goudard wrote in "L'Humanité": All French people, regardless of their political views or their opinions on the Soviet regime, can only endorse the Soviet policy of peacefully resolving the German question from the standpoint of national interests and the national interests of France. We know that this policy is to rebuild Germany into a unified, democratic and peace-loving country.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: According to TASS Moscow, 26th Dispatch: "Truth" published on the 26th a telegram from its Berlin correspondent Naumov titled "West German People Demand the Reunification of the Motherland," summarizing the West German newspapers' comments on the results of the Washington Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain and France.

	Naumov wrote that among the broad masses of the West German people, the decisions of the Washington Conference aroused extreme disappointment and severe condemnation. "Fulda People's News" said that the result of the Washington Conference was a "preparatory brake" invented by Dulles, the purpose of which was to prevent the upsurge of the world's movement to resolve disputes. Many newspapers pointed out that the proposal put forward by the Washington Conference to hold a Four Foreign Ministers Conference deviated from the past plan of holding a "highest-level" conference to resolve outstanding international issues. Some influential bourgeois newspapers, especially "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" and "Stuttgarter Zeitung," also expressed the same opinion.

	West German newspapers admitted that the decisions in Washington were intended to strengthen Adenauer's position in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Even the most reactionary newspapers, such as Augsburg's "Schwäbische Landeszeitung," openly admitted this.

	Many West German newspapers generally believe that the participants of the Washington Conference have sacrificed the hope of the German people for their country to be unified soon, in order to preserve the anti-popular Adenauer regime.

	Opposition to Adenauer's Social Democratic newspapers exposed the tricks played in Washington. Naumov pointed out: Because the Washington decision, which aims to support Adenauer, weakens the position of the Social Democrats in the upcoming elections, they want to expose it.

	Naumov concluded by writing: The people of West Germany are increasingly frequently demanding an end to the worthless verbal deceptions about German reunification and demanding effective steps to resolve the German question.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: TASS Washington, 27th Dispatch: A United Press reporter reported that it is believed here that the editorial published by "Truth" entitled "What the Washington Conference Tells Us" is tantamount to frankly demanding a Four-Power Peace Conference to discuss major issues in the Cold War. The reporter wrote: "Experts here say privately that this clearly shows that Russia is still pursuing a comprehensive peace conference."

    世界舆论重视“真理报”社论“华盛顿会议告诉我们什么”
    德、波、捷、匈等国报纸欢迎苏联和平倡议
    西德广大人民严厉谴责华盛顿会议的决定
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等国报纸，纷纷就苏联“真理报”七月二十三日社论“华盛顿会议告诉我们什么”发表评论。
    “新德意志报”社论强调指出：苏联在真正地争取按照全体德国人民的切身利益来和平解决德国问题，而华盛顿与波恩却在破坏要真正解决这个问题的一切建议。华盛顿会议参加者只希望分裂德国以及把西德并入侵略性的北大西洋集团。
    波兰“人民论坛报”以“争取协商思想获得胜利”为题发表社论说：苏联和平倡议的结果产生了缓和国际紧张局势的可能性。苏联的和平倡议受到全世界人民的热烈欢迎，甚至得到许多资产阶级政治领袖的支持。朝鲜停战谈判的结果再一次向全世界显示，没有任何问题（甚至最复杂的问题）不可能由有关各方的和平谈判与协议而得到解决。在这种情况下，一切真诚地和忠实地为缓和国际紧张局势而努力的人们对于美、英、法三国外长华盛顿会议的结果和公报感到很是失望。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”以“苏联和平政策的力量”为题发表社论说：“真理报”社论批判地分析了华盛顿会议公报，指出没有苏联代表参加的三国外长会议并没有使任何最尖锐的国际问题的解决更为接近。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”发表社论说：“真理报”社论正当地指出，西方三国外长会议本身就意味着无视基本的国际规则和国际法。非常清楚，凡愿意和他国政府进行真正有效的谈判的人们，不会背着他国政府而进行共谋，也不会提出片面拟就的条件。华盛顿会议证明，目前的重要任务是消除阻碍用协商方式解决主要国际争端的障碍。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：所有法国报纸都摘要刊载了“真理报”七月二十三日的社论：“华盛顿会议告诉我们什么”。“人道报”转载了社论全文。
    皮埃尔·古达德在“人道报”上写道：所有法国人，不管他们的政治见解如何，也不管他们对苏联政权的意见如何，他们从民族立场和法国的国家利益立场出发，都只能赞成苏联和平解决德国问题的政策。我们知道，这一政策就是把德国重建为一个统一的、民主的与爱好和平的国家。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：“真理报”二十六日刊载了驻柏林记者瑙莫夫题为“西德人民要求恢复祖国统一”的电讯，综述西德报纸对于美英法三国外长华盛顿会议结果的评论。
    瑙莫夫写道，在广大的西德人民中间，华盛顿会议的决定引起了极度的失望和严厉的谴责。“孚尔达人民新闻”说，华盛顿会议的结果是杜勒斯发明的一个“预备煞车”，目的是要阻止世界争取解决争执问题的运动的高涨。许多报纸指出，华盛顿会议提出的举行四国外长会议的建议背离了过去所提出的举行“最高级”会议来解决悬而未决的国际问题的计划。一些有影响的资产阶级报纸，特别是“法兰克福环球报”和“斯图加特报”也表示了同样的意见。
    西德报纸承认：华盛顿的决定是为了要加强阿登纳在未来议会选举中的地位。甚至最反动的报纸，譬如奥格斯堡的“施瓦本报”，也公开承认这一点。
    许多西德报纸普遍认为：华盛顿会议的参与者为了保留反人民的阿登纳政权，已经牺牲了德国人民要求他们的国家早日得到统一的希望。
    反对阿登纳的社会民主党报纸揭发了在华盛顿搞的花样。瑙莫夫指出：因为目的在支持阿登纳的华盛顿决定削弱了社会民主党人在未来选举中的地位，所以他们要揭发它。
    瑙莫夫最后写道：西德的人民正越来越频繁地要求停止没有价值的关于德国统一的口头欺骗，而要求采取有效的步骤来解决德国问题。
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十七日讯：合众社记者报道说，此间认为“真理报”所发表的题为“华盛顿会议告诉我们什么”的社论等于直率地要求举行四大国和平会议，讨论冷战中的重大问题。这个记者写道：“此间的专家在私下说，这显然表明俄国仍然在追求一个全面的和平会议。”
