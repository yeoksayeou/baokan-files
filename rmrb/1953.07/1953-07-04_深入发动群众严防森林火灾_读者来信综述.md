Thoroughly Mobilize the Masses to Strictly Prevent Forest Fires
—Summary of Readers' Letters

From April to June this year, we successively received letters from many readers in Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Anhui and other provinces, exposing the situation that the leading organs in some counties and districts relaxed forest protection work, resulting in continuous forest fires. Reader Li Xingbei wrote: According to statistics from the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau, from December last year to April this year, mountain fires occurred in 50 counties in Shanxi Province, with more than 190 mountain burning incidents; among them, Yuanqu, Jiaocheng, Fushan, Qinyuan and other counties had more than 10 consecutive mountain burning incidents. Xiang Rongnian of the Rural Production Office of Huizhou Prefecture, Anhui Province wrote: In the Huizhou Prefecture, nine counties had as many as 157 mountain burning incidents in more than 30 days from early March to April 6, destroying more than 20,000 mu of forest area. Wang Qingzhou of the CCP Tongbai County Committee, Yang Zhongzhen of the Tongbai County People's Government, and others wrote: Since the beginning of spring, more than 30 mountain fires have occurred continuously in the county up to early April, and it is estimated that more than 40,000 mu of mountain forest area have been burned. Readers in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province reflected: From January to April this year, 28 large and small mountain burning incidents occurred in the five counties of Linyu, Funing, Qian'an, Qianxi, and Zunhua in the district, and it is estimated that about 870 mu of young forests were destroyed. These mountain burning incidents have caused great losses to the motherland's forests, which is very detrimental to the country's construction work.

Why did mountain fires occur so frequently in these areas this year? Readers' letters pointed out: Last year, after various localities implemented the State Council's "Instructions on Strictly Preventing Forest Fires," mountain forest fire incidents decreased significantly; the leading organs in some areas developed complacency, believing that the problem of fire prevention and forest protection had been resolved, and no longer continued to attach importance to it. Therefore, this year, they only made general appeals for forest protection work without specific leadership, and did not lead or inspect the established fire prevention and forest protection organizations for a long time; as a result, the forest protection organizations existed in name only, no one cared about forest protection work, and forest fires occurred frequently. What is even more serious is that some county and district cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of protecting mountain forests, and do not actively rescue after mountain burning incidents occur, allowing national resources to be lost. For example, mountain burning incidents occurred frequently in Jixi County, Anhui Province this spring, but the leading comrades of the local People's Government turned a blind eye. On April 3, there were six mountain fires on the mountains opposite the county People's Government, and the leading cadres of the Public Security Bureau and the People's Armed Forces Department of the county People's Government did not care about the mountain fires that were close at hand; it was not until a serious incident occurred in which firefighters were burned that they ran out of the office to take a look. The county had 75 mountain burning incidents from January to April, burning 16,500 mu of mountain areas. In addition, the People's Governments in some areas have not dealt with the responsible persons who caused the mountain burning incidents in a timely and serious manner, which cannot effectively educate the masses, and also affects the enthusiasm of the masses in protecting forests.

In order to prevent forest fires and avoid losses to the country's valuable resources, it is necessary to carry out mass-based, regular forest protection and fire prevention work. The People's Governments in various mountain forest areas must attach importance to this work, correct the complacent thinking of being satisfied with existing achievements, regularly and conscientiously check the implementation of forest protection and fire prevention policies, improve the mass organizations for fire prevention and forest protection, and deeply publicize the great benefits of forests to industry and agriculture to the masses, so that forests will no longer continue to be damaged by fires.

### 深入发动群众严防森林火灾——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    深入发动群众严防森林火灾
    ——读者来信综述
    今年四月到六月，我们连续接到山西、河北、河南、安徽等省的许多读者来信，揭发部分县区领导机关放松护林工作，以致山林火灾不断发生的情况。读者李兴北来信：据山西省林业局统计，从去年十二月到今年四月，山西全省有五十个县份发生山火，烧山事件达一百九十余次；其中垣曲、交城、浮山、沁源等县连续发生烧山事件十次以上。安徽徽州专区农村生产办公室项荣年来信：徽州专区九个县在三月上旬到四月六日三十多天中竟发生烧山事件一百五十七次之多，被毁森林面积达二万多亩。中共河南省桐柏县委会王清洲、桐柏县人民政府杨忠震等来信：该县入春以来到四月上旬连续发生山火三十余次，估计烧毁山林面积达四万余亩。河北唐山专区读者反映：该区临榆、抚宁、迁安、迁西、遵化五县从今年一月至四月发生大小烧山事件二十八起，估计被毁幼林约八百七十余亩。这些烧山事件使祖国的森林受到很大损失，对国家建设工作是很不利的。
    为什么今年这些地区山火发生频繁呢？读者来信指出：去年各地执行政务院“关于严防森林火灾的指示”后，山林火灾事件显著减少；某些地区的领导机关就产生麻痹思想，认为防火护林问题已经解决，不再继续重视。因此，今年他们对护林工作只作一般号召而没有具体领导，对已成立的防火护林组织也长期不加领导、检查；于是护林组织形同虚设，护林工作无人过问，森林火灾也就经常发生。而更严重的是：有一部分县区干部对保护山林的重大意义认识不足，在烧山事件发生后不积极抢救，任凭国家资源遭受损失。像安徽绩溪县今春烧山事件发生频繁，当地人民政府领导同志却熟视无睹。四月三日县人民政府对面的山上有六处山头起火，该县人民政府公安局、人民武装部等机关的领导干部在山火发生近在咫尺的地方也都不闻不问；直到打火群众被烧伤的严重事件发生后，他们才跑出办公室去看看。该县今年一月到四月即发生七十五次烧山事件，烧山场一万六千五百多亩。此外，还有一些地区的人民政府对引起烧山事件的责任者没有及时严肃处理，这就不能有效地教育群众，也影响了群众护林的积极性。
    为了防止森林火灾，以免国家宝贵资源受到损失，必须开展群众性的经常性的护林防火工作。各山林地区的人民政府必须重视这个工作，纠正满足于既有成绩的麻痹思想，经常认真检查护林防火政策的执行情况，健全防火护林的群众组织，深入向群众宣传森林对工、农业的重大利益，使森林不再继续受到火灾的破坏。
