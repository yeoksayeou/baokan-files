Comrades, Friends:
    Today, we are here to welcome the remains of the anti-Japanese martyrs who were brutally murdered by Japanese militarists during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Our hearts are filled with infinite grief and anger.

    These anti-Japanese martyrs were outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. In order to win the liberation of the Chinese nation and to uphold justice and peace, they bravely resisted the barbaric aggression of the Japanese militarists. Unfortunately, some of them were captured by the Japanese imperialist army in the war, and some were captured by the Japanese imperialist army to be laborers. They were killed under the inhuman torture of Japanese militarists. Every Chinese people will always remember this blood debt and will never forget the bloody crimes of the Japanese militarists.

    Today, we can comfort the anti-Japanese martyrs who died in Japan: our motherland, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the wise leader Chairman Mao, has defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our motherland has embarked on the road of independence, democracy, peace, prosperity, and strength.

    At the same time, we can also comfort the martyrs: the peace-loving people of Japan are also increasingly aware of the crimes of the Japanese militarists. The peace-loving people of Japan are struggling for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy under the enslavement of American imperialism and the oppression of the Yoshida government, and are stubbornly fighting against the revival of Japanese militarist forces. We firmly believe that the peace-loving people of Japan will be able to smash the conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and play their role in the struggle to defend peace in the East and the world.

    As we welcome the remains of the anti-Japanese martyrs back to the motherland, we would like to thank the overseas Chinese in Japan and the peace-loving groups and people in Japan. They have made great efforts in the struggle against the obstruction of the Yoshida government and to bring the remains of the martyrs back to China.

    Today, with the feeling of turning grief into strength, we welcome the remains of the anti-Japanese martyrs who heroically sacrificed for the motherland. We will consolidate our victory, build our country, and commemorate our dear comrades who sacrificed under the Japanese soil in the resolute struggle to stabilize the motherland, peace in the East, and defend world peace.

    Eternal glory to the anti-Japanese martyrs!

    廖承志在迎接抗日烈士遗骨仪式上的致词各位同胞，各位朋友：
    今天我们在这里迎接在抗日战争期间，被日本军国主义分子残酷杀害的抗日烈士的遗骨，我们心里充满着无限的悲痛和愤怒。
    这些抗日烈士是中国民族的优秀儿女。他们为了争取中国民族的解放，为了维护正义与和平，曾英勇地反抗了日本军国主义者的野蛮侵略。不幸他们有的在战争中被日本帝国主义军队所俘掳，有的被日本帝国主义军队抓去当劳工。他们在日本军国主义分子惨无人道的百般折磨下，被杀害了。每个中国人民都将永远记得这笔血债，都永远不会忘记日本军国主义分子的血腥罪行。
    今天，我们可以向死难在日本的抗日烈士们告慰：我们的祖国在伟大的中国共产党和英明的领袖毛主席领导下，已经战胜了日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮。在中华人民共和国成立以来，我们的祖国已走上独立、民主、和平、繁荣、富强的大道。
    同时我们也可以向烈士们告慰：日本爱好和平的人民也日益认识日本军国主义分子的罪恶。爱好和平的日本人民正在美帝国主义的奴役和吉田政府的压迫下，为争取日本的独立、和平、民主而起来斗争，为反对日本军国主义势力复活而顽强地进行斗争。我们坚信日本爱好和平的人民一定能够粉碎复活日本军国主义的阴谋，在保卫东方和全世界的和平斗争中，发挥他们的力量。
    在我们迎接抗日烈士遗骨返抵祖国的时候，我们向留日华侨以及日本爱好和平的团体和人士致谢。他们在反对吉田政府的阻挠，争取烈士遗骨送回中国的斗争中，出了很大的力量。
    今天，我们以化悲痛为力量的心情迎接为祖国英勇牺牲的抗日烈士们的遗骨。我们将巩固我们的胜利，建设我们的国家，在祖国安定东方和平与保卫世界和平的坚决斗争中，纪念我们牺牲在日本地底下的亲爱的战友们。
    抗日烈士们永垂不朽！
