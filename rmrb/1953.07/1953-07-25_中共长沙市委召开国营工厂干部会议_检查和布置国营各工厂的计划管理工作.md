The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of cadres from state-owned factories in Changsha in late June. The meeting focused on reviewing the implementation of state plans by various factories since the production reform and identifying key issues, and it deployed the work for the third quarter of this year.

Over the past three years, the leading cadres of most factories in Changsha have begun to understand the characteristics of production in their respective factories, leverage the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, improve production, and gradually resolve key production issues. Since April, there has also been some improvement in fulfilling production plans and strengthening planning management. However, the most prominent problem in current work is that the work plans of most factories are still not accurate or comprehensive. For example, in the past, the work plan of Hunan Machinery Factory was only compiled by the progress section of the production department. The plan of the Fourth Line Engineering Team of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau was compiled based on the electricity consumption data of last year or the year before, resulting in some users exceeding the forecast by 66% in April, while others only reached 38%. The phenomenon of incomplete work plans is even more common. Generally, only the product name, quantity, and work-hour plans are included, without content related to quality specifications, raw material supply, labor allocation, equipment operation, and equipment maintenance. Therefore, they are not connected. After the work plan is compiled, it is not fully discussed by the masses, so the plan lacks a mass basis. In the past, when Hunan Machinery Factory discussed the plan every month, it only presented the numbers for everyone to distribute, and the work plan became a "work assignment sheet," and the discussion meeting became a "work division meeting." Furthermore, many factories have not grasped the implementation of the plan, no one is responsible for controlling the production progress, and the implementation of the plan cannot be reflected in time. Therefore, the serious phenomenon of overtime work before May and some weak links hindering production have occurred.

Secondly, due to the lack of regular production education and planning concept education for the workers, the phenomena of workers not caring about plans and lax labor discipline are quite common (there have been many improvements recently), which seriously hinders the implementation of the plan.

Based on the above situation, the meeting decided that the working principle for the third quarter is: resolutely complete the third-quarter plan and grasp the central link of planning management. It is required that all factories must improve the compilation, discussion, and implementation of work plans in accordance with specific circumstances. In order to ensure and supervise the implementation of the work plan, each factory must establish and improve a three-level organization and system for timely inspection and mastery of the plan's progress at the factory, workshop, and team levels. As for the dispatching organization, it should be gradually established based on the actual situation. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the basic recording work and initially establish the necessary responsibility systems, such as the production command responsibility system, the dispatching responsibility system, and the shift handover system. Furthermore, in conjunction with summarizing the production in the second quarter and discussing the production plans for the third quarter and July, each factory should conduct a relatively broad and in-depth ideological education on establishing planning and production concepts, so that workers understand the important significance of planning management and realize that lax labor discipline has serious harm to the interests of the country and the working class and is a major obstacle to completing the state plan.

In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, each factory is required to pay more attention to safety and health work, conduct regular inspections, improve living and environmental sanitation, and ensure that the attendance rate continues to increase.

    中共长沙市委召开国营工厂干部会议
    检查和布置国营各工厂的计划管理工作
    中共长沙市委于六月下旬召开了长沙市国营工厂干部会议，着重检查了生产改革以来各厂执行国家计划的情况和主要问题，布置了今年第三季度的工作。
    三年来，长沙市绝大多数工厂的领导干部，已开始能够从各该工厂生产的特点出发，发挥广大职工的生产积极性，改进了生产，并逐步解决生产上的关键问题。四月以后，在完成生产计划和加强计划管理方面，也都有了一些好转。但当前工作中的最突出的问题是大部分工厂的作业计划还不准确，也不全面。如过去湖南机械厂的作业计划只由生产科进度股编制。湘中电业局第四线路工区的计划是根据去年或前年的用电资料编制的，以致四月份有的用户用电超出预计百分之六十六，有的就只达到百分之三十八。作业计划不全面的现象更是普遍，一般只有产品名称、数量和工时计划，没有质量规格、原材料供应、劳动力调配、设备运转和设备检修等计划内容，因此互不衔接。在编制了作业计划以后，又没能充分发动群众讨论，因此，所订的计划就缺乏群众基础。湖南机械厂以前每月讨论计划时，只是把数字摆一下，大家来分配，作业计划成了“派工单”，讨论会成了“分工会”。再就是许多工厂都没有抓紧计划贯彻执行，生产进度无人负责掌握，计划执行情况不能及时反映上来，因此，就出现了五月以前严重的加班加点现象和阻碍生产的某些薄弱环节。
    其次，由于没有经常向职工群众进行生产教育和计划观念的教育，职工中不关心计划和劳动纪律松弛的现象相当普遍（目前已有不少改进），严重地妨害了计划的贯彻。
    会议根据以上情况，决定第三季度的工作方针是：坚决完成第三季度计划，抓住计划管理这个中心环节。要求各工厂必须按照具体情况，切实改进作业计划的编制、讨论和贯彻的工作。为了保证和监督作业计划的贯彻，各厂必须建立和健全厂、车间、小组三级的及时检查和掌握计划进度的组织和制度，至于调度组织，应从实际情况出发，逐步建立起来。同时，要健全基层记录工作，初步建立必要的责任制度，如生产指挥责任制、调度责任制和交接班制等。再就是，结合总结第二季度生产，讨论第三季度与七月份生产计划，各厂要进行一次比较广泛深入的有关树立计划和生产观念的思想教育，使职工明白计划管理的重要意义；认识到劳动纪律松弛对国家和工人阶级的利益有严重的危害性，是完成国家计划的重大障碍。
    为了保证计划的贯彻，要求各厂多注意安全卫生工作，要进行定期检查，改进生活和环境卫生，保证出勤率不断提高。
