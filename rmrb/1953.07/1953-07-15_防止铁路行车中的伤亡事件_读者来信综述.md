    Preventing Casualties in Railway Traffic
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting the serious situation of various accidents occurring frequently on railways across the country, causing casualties. Reader Li Derong's letter reflects: According to incomplete statistics, from January to early May this year, the Harbin Railway Bureau had a total of 28 unfortunate casualty incidents (excluding accidents for which the railway is primarily responsible), resulting in 26 deaths, 7 injuries, and even more livestock being crushed to death. Reader Li Chongshen's letter reflects: The Beijing Railway Bureau (excluding the Zhangjiakou branch) had a total of 34 death and injury incidents in the past year, resulting in 15 deaths, 16 injuries, 28 livestock crushed to death, and 17 carts damaged... Similar situations exist on other railway lines.
    Most of these accidents are caused by the public's lack of knowledge about railway traffic and their complacency. Some people try to cross the tracks before the train at level crossings, thus causing casualties. For example, on May 16, when train No. 485 was traveling between Wanghuabao and Handan Town on the Beijing-Hankou line, two farmers, Lü Zenglu and others, drove a cart across the level crossing, resulting in one death, one injury, and the livestock being crushed to death. On March 23, two farmers were driving a cart across the railway between Kuandian and Longzhaogou when the ox's hoof suddenly got stuck in the track gap. The two farmers got out of the cart to pull the ox's hoof, not paying attention to the train, and were both crushed to death. A more serious incident occurred in Shenyang, where a public bus broke down while crossing a level crossing. The bus driver did not take timely measures to push the bus off the railway, and the train could not stop in time, resulting in a tragic incident with 20 bus passengers injured or killed. Some farmers graze livestock along the railway lines, resulting in livestock being crushed to death by trains. Many readers' letters reflect this situation. Some parents allow children to play on the tracks without dissuasion, thus causing casualties. For example, the Zhangdian Station on the Jiaoji Line had two similar incidents in April and May alone. In addition, some passengers do not pay attention to safety when riding trains, boarding when the train is starting or alighting when the train has not stopped completely, resulting in falls and injuries; some passengers stand at the train door and may fall off the train due to vibrations if they are not careful. There are also many casualties caused by railway workers being irresponsible and violating labor discipline. For example, if drivers exceed the speed limit when driving, switchmen throw the wrong switches, or shunting operations lack sufficient communication, it is easy to cause major accidents such as head-on train collisions or derailments.
    It should be stated that since the national liberation, thanks to the efforts of the railway departments and the coordinated publicity of local governments and public security organs, the number of casualty incidents in railway traffic has decreased compared to the past; however, according to the situation reflected by readers, this is still a serious problem. In order to ensure traffic safety and completely eliminate casualty accidents, railway leading organs at all levels should educate employees to attach importance to traffic safety work ideologically and abide by technical management regulations and relevant rules and regulations. For example, drivers should pay attention to observation when the locomotive is running, and must sound the whistle when passing through tunnels, bridges, and level crossings, and should pay attention to reducing the speed when pedestrians or vehicles are found ahead. The railway department should properly repair level crossings and pedestrian paths that have been in disrepair for many years, and set up obvious signs at bridges, tunnels, level crossings, etc., and assign special personnel to guard important places. Local people's governments (especially district and township governments along the railway lines) should cooperate with local stations to widely publicize accident prevention to the masses, educate farmers not to graze livestock on railway lines and to hold gatherings near railways; not to rush across the road when passing through level crossings; and not to allow children to play near railways. Passengers should obey the instructions of the train staff and consciously abide by train discipline; train attendants should strengthen publicity to passengers about safety precautions when riding trains. As long as all parties pay attention to this issue and make the greatest efforts to do it, casualties in railway traffic can be avoided.

### 防止铁路行车中的伤亡事件——读者来信综述

    防止铁路行车中的伤亡事件
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们收到很多读者来信，反映各地铁路上经常发生各种事故，造成伤亡的严重情况。读者李德荣来信反映：据不完全的统计，今年一月到五月上旬，哈尔滨铁路管理局共发生不幸伤亡事件二十八起（不包括铁路负主要责任的事故），计死二十六人，伤七人，牲畜被轧死的更多。读者李崇申来信反映：北京铁路管理局（不包括张家口分局），在去年一年内共发生死伤事件三十四起，死十五人，伤十六人，轧死牲畜二十八匹，毁损大车十七辆……。在其它各铁路线上，也有类似的情况。
    这些事故，大部分是因为群众缺乏铁路行车常识和思想麻痹而造成的。有些人在通过道口时与火车抢行，因此造成伤亡事件。如五月十六日第四百八十五次列车行至京汉线王化堡与邯郸镇间时，农民吕增禄等二人赶大车抢过道口，结果被火车轧死一人、轧伤一人，牲口也被轧死了。三月二十三日，有农民二人赶大车通过宽甸与龙爪沟间的铁路时，牛蹄突然陷在轨缝内；这两个农民下车拔牛蹄，没有注意火车，结果都被轧死。比较严重的事件是：沈阳有一辆公共汽车在通过道口时发生故障，汽车司机没有及时设法把汽车推离铁路，火车通过时停车不及，发生了汽车乘客伤亡二十名的惨痛事件。有些农民在铁路沿线放牲畜，以致牲畜被火车轧死。不少读者来信反映了这种情况，有些家长任小孩在铁轨上玩耍不加劝阻，因此造成伤亡事件。如胶济线张店站在四、五两个月内就发生了两起同类事件。此外，有些旅客乘车时不注意安全，在火车开动时上车或者在火车未停稳时下车，因而被摔死摔伤；有的旅客乘车时站在车门口，一不小心也会被震动坠车。也有很多伤亡事件是因铁路职工工作不负责任、违反劳动纪律而造成的。如司机行车时超过限制速度，转辙员搬错道岔，调车时互相联系不够，就容易发生列车正面冲突、脱轨颠覆等重大事故。
    应该说明，全国解放以来，经过铁路部门的努力以及各地政府和公安机关的配合宣传，铁路行车中发生的伤亡事件已经比过去减少了；但是根据读者反映的情况来看，这在目前仍旧是一个严重的问题。为了保障行车安全、彻底消灭伤亡事故，各级铁路领导机关应该教育职工从思想上重视行车安全工作，遵守技术管理规程和有关章则制度。如司机在机车行驶时应注意瞭望，在通过山洞、桥梁、道口时必须鸣笛，发现前方有行人、车辆时应该注意减低行驶速度。铁路部门对年久失修的道口和行人便道应妥善修理，并在桥梁、山洞、道口等处设置明显标志，重要地方应派专人看守。各地人民政府（尤其是铁路沿线的区乡政府），应配合当地车站向群众广泛进行有关防止事故的宣传，教育农民不要在铁路线上牧放牲畜及在铁路附近举行集会；在通过道口时不要抢道；不要让儿童在铁路旁玩耍。乘车旅客应该服从列车人员的指挥，自觉遵守列车纪律；列车员对旅客加强有关乘车时注意安全的宣传。只要各方面都重视这个问题，并且尽最大的努力去作，铁路行车中的伤亡事件是可以避免的。
