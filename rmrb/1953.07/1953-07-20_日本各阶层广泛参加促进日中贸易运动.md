    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: With a further decline in export trade, increasingly broad sectors of Japanese society are participating in the movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade.
    One hundred and fifty Diet members from local assemblies across Japan who actively advocate for Sino-Japanese trade and twenty Diet members from the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade" held a national conference on June 20th at the House of Representatives Hall in Tokyo. The meeting resolved to establish a "National Council of Local Assembly Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade" to strengthen the movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade throughout the country. The meeting also made the following decisions: to request the Yoshida government to relax restrictions on the types of goods exported to China, to request the Yoshida government to grant freedom to travel abroad, and to have the Diet and local assemblies pass resolutions promoting Sino-Japanese trade.
    The movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade is also developing among local government officials in Japan. The National Mayors' Conference, held in Tokyo on June 23rd and 24th, unanimously passed a resolution promoting Sino-Japanese trade. The National Mayors' Conference also established a subcommittee based on this resolution to draft specific plans for promoting Sino-Japanese trade, requesting the Yoshida government, the Speakers of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, and various political parties to promote Sino-Japanese trade.

    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：在出口贸易进一步萎缩的情况下，越来越广泛的日本社会阶层正在参加到促进日中贸易的运动中来。
    日本全国各地方议会中积极主张日中贸易的一百五十名议员和“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”的二十名议员于六月二十日在东京众议院会馆举行了全国会议。会上决议成立“地方议员促进日中贸易联盟全国协议会”，以加强全国各地促进日中贸易的运动。会议并作出了：要求吉田政府放宽向中国输出货物的种类限制，要求吉田政府给予出国自由，使国会和地方议会通过促进日中贸易的决议等项决定。
    促进日中贸易的运动，也在日本地方政府官员间发展。六月二十三、二十四两天在东京举行的全国市长会议，全体一致通过了促进日中贸易的决议。全国市长会议并根据这一决议成立了小组委员会，草拟促进日中贸易的具体方案，要求吉田政府、国会参院和众院议长以及各政党促进日中贸易。
