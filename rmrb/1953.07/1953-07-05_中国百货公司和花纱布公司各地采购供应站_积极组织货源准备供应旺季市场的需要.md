China Department Store and Textile Company purchasing and supply stations across the country are stepping up their efforts to expand sources of goods in order to fully supply the upcoming peak season market.

The Shanghai purchasing and supply station of China Department Store and Textile Company has expanded processing orders to twenty-seven major industries in Shanghai, including private dyeing and weaving, knitting, wool spinning, enamel, and rubber. The preliminary purchase plan for the third quarter of the Shanghai Department Store purchasing and supply station increased by 28 percent compared to the same period last year. The third-quarter purchase plan of the Tianjin purchasing and supply station of China Department Store also increased by 44 percent compared to the original control figure. In early June, Northeast wholesale department stores at all levels signed third-quarter ordering contracts with state-owned and locally state-owned industrial departments in the Northeast region. The total value of orders increased by about 18 percent compared to the second quarter; the number of order categories doubled compared to the second quarter. Prior to this, Northeast wholesale department stores at all levels also signed procurement contracts with relevant departments outside the Northeast region, equivalent to two-thirds of the total value of this order. The total wholesale volume of the Xi'an purchasing, supply, and wholesale station of China Department Store in the third quarter increased by 42.8 percent compared to the original plan, and the variety of goods increased by one-third compared to the second quarter. The supply plan for the second half of the year of the Xi'an purchasing and supply station of China Textile Company also increased by 22 percent compared to the original plan. State-owned department stores and textile company purchasing and supply stations in Guangzhou, Wuhan, Handan and other regions also attach importance to the work of leading the market and are actively expanding the organization of goods.

This year, when organizing goods for the peak season, all regions have paid attention to investigating production and sales conditions and understanding the needs of residents, implementing the policy of serving the development of production and meeting the needs of the people.

In terms of understanding the needs of residents, various regions have created many new methods. The Shenyang Department Store held a "Winter Clothing Exhibition," displaying more than 300 kinds of cold-proof commodities that the Shenyang Department Store plans to supply this winter. Each commodity is marked with specifications, origin, and price. Visitors can write down their opinions and specific requirements regarding the variety, specifications, quality, and price of the displayed items. Residents of Shenyang are extremely interested in the "Winter Clothing Exhibition." Three days after the opening of the exhibition, there were more than 60,000 visitors, who put forward more than 2,600 opinions. The Shenyang Department Store will study several major winter supplies based on the opinions put forward by visitors as the main basis for formulating this year's winter clothing supply plan.

In terms of serving production, the Guangzhou Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station, based on the principle of supporting local industry, organized a cost accounting team to go deep into factories in cooperation with the Guangzhou Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce to help verify costs and reduce expenses. They carried out specific guidance and effective supervision on the variety, style, and specifications of processed and ordered goods, so that local industrial products can meet consumer needs in order to expand sales. The Shanghai Textile Company Purchasing and Supply Station established a sample selection team. Whenever new printed fabrics are processed, the sample selection team conducts careful research and selection of colors and patterns in advance. The team members often conduct investigations and research from the market, state-owned department stores, retail companies, cooperatives, and purchasing representatives from various regions. If they find that a certain printed fabric is not popular with consumers, they will notify the relevant factory to improve it or suggest that the factory pattern designers make new designs. Therefore, the summer printed fabrics supplied by the Shanghai Textile Company Purchasing and Supply Station are popular with the majority of consumers. Many new printed fabrics are sold out as soon as they are on the market and must be reprinted immediately. Among them, the No. 6014 worker-peasant-soldier plaid fabric has been reprinted nine times and is still being reprinted. Some new printed fabrics have been fully ordered before they leave the factory because the opinions of purchasing representatives from various regions were solicited in advance. At present, the station is trying to further strengthen its ties with sales units in various regions in order to frequently understand the needs of the people in various regions and help improve production; in the future, it also plans to notify sales units in various regions of samples of new printed fabrics for selection and purchase.

In the work of organizing goods for the peak season, all regions have taken into account the actual needs of different consumer groups and the balanced development of large, medium, and small cities and industries. The purchasing power of workers in large cities and industrial and mining areas is relatively high. They not only continue to need large quantities of cotton yarn fabrics such as coarse cloth and fine cloth, but also need more worsted, khaki, gabardine, corduroy and other thread fabrics than before; they are no longer satisfied with ordinary single-sided lined thread socks, but require wool socks suitable for autumn and winter wear. Therefore, the Shanghai purchasing and supply station of China Department Store and Textile Company paid special attention to leveraging the higher quality characteristics of Shanghai light industrial products in this expansion of processing orders. In terms of cotton cloth, it is preparing to process more thread fabrics and add more than ten kinds of high-quality cloths such as cretonne. In terms of wool yarn, the amount of processing orders has more than doubled compared to last autumn, in addition to increasing low-grade coarse wool, it will also increase high-grade coarse wool and fine wool by about 200,000 pounds. On the other hand, more attention has been paid to the purchasing level and actual needs of the vast rural areas and general residents, and local industrial products needed by the local people are purchased as much as possible. The total value of goods purchased by the Northeast department store system in the third quarter is equivalent to 90 percent of the total industrial output value of the region in the third quarter, while the total value of goods purchased within the region in the second quarter, including the additional order figures in May, only accounted for 78 percent of the total industrial output value. The Xi'an purchasing, supply, and wholesale station of China Department Store processed and ordered a large number of enamelware, thread blankets, towels, cloth shoes and other commodities in Xi'an. The Xi'an purchasing and supply station of China Textile Company plans to process 34 percent more cotton cloth locally in the third quarter than in the same period last year, and the dyed fabrics of various colors have increased by 86 percent, including blue cloth, Yuan Ke cloth and red cloth, which are most popular among the people of various ethnic groups in the Northwest. The Changsha purchasing and supply station of China Department Store has signed contracts with Changsha knitting, weaving and dyeing industries and various handicraft production cooperatives for a large number of processed bed sheets, winter socks, towels, stationery, rubber shoes and other industrial products. The station's purchase plan this year has more than doubled compared to last year, of which about 30 percent are processed and purchased locally.

    中国百货公司和花纱布公司各地采购供应站
    积极组织货源准备供应旺季市场的需要
    中国百货公司和花纱布公司各地采购供应站，正在加紧进行扩大货源的工作，以便充分供应即将到来的旺季市场。
    中国百货公司和花纱布公司上海采购供应站向上海市私营染织、针织、毛纺、搪瓷、橡胶等二十七个主要行业扩大了加工订货。上海百货采购供应站第三季度的初步采购计划，比去年同期增加了百分之二十八。中国百货公司天津采购供应站第三季度的采购计划也较原来控制数字增大了百分之四十四。东北各级百货批发站在六月上旬和东北区国营、地方国营工业部门签订了第三季度订货合同，订货总值比第二季度增加了百分之十八左右；订货品类比第二季度增加了一倍。在此以前，东北各级百货批发站并和东北区外有关部门签订了相当于这次订货总值三分之二的进货合同。中国百货公司西安采购供应批发站第三季度的批发总额，较原计划增加了百分之四十二点八，货物品种比第二季度增加了三分之一。中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站下半年的供应计划也比原计划增加了百分之二十二。广州、武汉、邯郸等地区的国营百货公司和花纱布公司采购供应站也都重视了领导市场的工作，正在积极扩大组织货源。
    今年各地在组织旺季货源的时候，都注意了调查产销情况、了解居民需要的工作，贯彻了为发展生产满足人民需要服务的方针。
    在了解居民需要方面，各地创造了许多新的办法。沈阳市百货公司举办了“冬装展览会”，陈列着沈阳市百货公司准备在今年冬季供应的防寒商品达三百多种，每种商品都标明规格、产地和价格。参观者可就陈列物品的品种、规格、质量、价格等方面写下自己的意见和具体要求。沈阳市的居民对“冬装展览会”极感兴趣，展览会开幕后三天，观众已有六万多人，共提出二千六百多条意见。沈阳市百货公司将根据参观者提出的意见，分别研究几种主要的冬季用品，做为制订今年冬装供应计划的主要依据。
    在为生产服务方面，广州市百货采购供应站根据扶植地方工业的原则，组织了成本核算小组，配合广州市工商局深入工厂，帮助核实成本，降低费用；对加工订货的商品品种、式样、规格，进行了具体的指导和有效的监督，使当地工业产品能适应消费者需要，以便扩大推销。上海花纱布采购供应站成立了选样小组，每当加工新花布时，选样小组都预先慎重研究和选择花色花样。小组人员经常从市场、国营百货公司、零售公司、合作社以及各地采购代表等方面进行调查研究，发现某种花布不受消费者欢迎，就通知有关工厂加以改进，或者建议工厂图案设计人员进行新的设计。因此，上海花纱布采购供应站供应的夏令花布受到广大消费者的欢迎，许多新花布一上市就销售完了，必须立即组织翻印。其中第六○一四号工农兵格子花布已翻印了九次，目前还在继续翻印中。有的新花布由于事先征求了各地采购代表的意见，成品尚未出厂就被全部订购了。目前，该站正设法进一步加强与各地销货单位的联系，以便经常了解各地人民需要，帮助改进生产；今后还准备把新花布的样品通知各地销售单位，以供各地选购。
    各地在组织旺季货源的工作中，根据不同消费阶层的实际需要，照顾了大中小城市工业平衡发展的问题。大城市和工矿地区职工的购买力是较高的，他们不仅继续需要大量的粗布、细布等棉纱织品，而且需要较前更多的哔叽、卡其、华达呢、灯芯绒等线织品；他们已经不满足于一般的单面夹底的线袜，而要求适宜于秋冬季穿的棉毛袜。因此，中国百货公司和花纱布公司的上海采购供应站在这次扩大加工订货中，就特别注意发挥上海轻工业品品质较高的特点，在棉布方面，准备多加工线织品和增添克罗丁等十多种上等布匹；在毛线方面，加工订货量比去年秋季增加了一倍以上，除增加低级粗绒外，并增加高级粗绒和细绒二十万磅左右。另一方面，更注意了广大农村和一般居民的购买水平和实际需要，尽量采购为当地人民所需要的地方工业品。东北百货系统第三季度在区内进货的总值，相当于本区工业第三季度生产总值的百分之九十，而第二季度区内进货总值加上五月份追加订货数字在内，仅占工业生产总值的百分之七十八。中国百货公司西安采购供应批发站在西安市加工订购了大批搪瓷、线毯、毛巾、布鞋等商品。中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站第三季度计划在当地加工的棉布，比去年同期增加百分之三十四，加染的各种色布增加了百分之八十六，其中包括为西北各族人民最喜爱的品质优良的蓝布、元科布和红布。中国百货公司长沙采购供应站已经和长沙市针织、织染等业与各手工业生产合作社签订了大量加工被单、冬袜、毛巾、文具、胶鞋等工业品的合同，该站今年进货计划比去年增加了一倍多，其中在本地加工采购的约占百分之三十。
