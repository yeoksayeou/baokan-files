To Do Rural Work Well, One Must Study the Three Documents Carefully
    ——Gains and Problems of County and District Cadres in Wuxiang County Studying the CCP Central Committee's Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation and Other Three Documents
    Li Chunren Chang Weihan
    Starting from early April, county and district cadres in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, studied the CCP Central Committee's Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation, the instructions to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production, and the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." During this study, the majority of cadres overcame their past thoughts of being too busy with work, lacking time, and being unable to study diligently. They regarded the three documents as a guide for rural work and studied them conscientiously. As a result, in the most tense and busy season of correcting the tendency of blind advance and fully leading spring plowing production, they managed to work and study simultaneously, achieving good results in improving work and raising cadres' thinking. To understand the achievements and existing problems of the two months of study, so as to further deepen the study, a test and inspection were conducted at an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres in early June.
    This study has yielded certain gains:
    First, the majority of cadres have recognized and acted upon the principle of making production the overriding central task in rural areas, and have initially overcome the previous practices of egalitarianism and decentralism. County-level leading cadres, on the one hand, strictly controlled various meetings, and on the other hand, improved their leadership style by going deep into various districts and villages to provide specific guidance, discover problems, and solve problems. During spring plowing, each district often had direct guidance from a county committee member, enabling problems to be solved in a timely manner. More than half of the cadres from various agencies regularly went to the countryside to do practical work, greatly changing the previous practice of only issuing instructions, sending forms, and requesting materials from the offices. The district committees of each district adopted a method of rotational inspection, with district cadres going deep into villages, cooperatives, and teams to understand the situation, discover problems, and help solve them, greatly reducing the phenomenon of village cadres and the broad masses of people delaying work. The broad masses of farmers reflected: "This is what it really means to do a good job in production! Like before, it was just talk." The masses and village cadres have become more trusting and supportive of county and district cadres.
    Second, the majority of leading cadres have begun to grasp the principle of proceeding from reality and from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy. Everyone correctly recognized that the previous assessment of the work foundation in Wuxiang County was too high and the demands were too high, thus causing a tendency of blind advance in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, resulting in a work style of coercion and command and the mistake of attacking and discriminating against individual farmers. After studying the central documents, the county committee, in light of the actual situation in Wuxiang County, actively and steadily corrected the tendency of blind advance in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Wuxiang County, reorganizing the original 166 agricultural production cooperatives into 148. Regarding the issue of pricing livestock, sheep, and farm tools for joining the cooperatives, with the exception of some livestock and farm tools that were still retained as the cooperative's public property under the principle of genuine voluntariness of the members, the vast majority have been returned to the members. The cadres of each district and village grasped the principle of starting from increasing grain production and increasing income, and changed the past practices of overemphasizing collectivity and blindly setting up large stalls within the cooperatives and teams. In many villages, methods of taking materials locally and promoting them locally were adopted, land was ranked, plant and ear counts were calculated, and local experience in high yields was summarized, which greatly educated the masses with examples and achieved great results, and reasonable close planting was done well. Cadres also mostly adopted a positive leadership, patient assistance, and educational attitude towards individual farmers.
    Third, in the past, many cadres did not dare to publicize the protection of farmers' ownership, especially the principle of voluntariness in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, fearing that the cooperatives and teams would disband. After studying, most county and district cadres began to recognize that the individual peasant economy will still be a large presence for a long time to come, recognized the importance of firmly consolidating the alliance with middle peasants, correctly and more completely publicized and implemented the social policies of protecting farmers' ownership and voluntariness and mutual benefit, and corrected the erroneous sayings that were circulating in the past, such as "Three years of cooperation, five years of collectivization, every household must join agricultural cooperatives"; in handling mutual aid and cooperation issues, they truly grasped the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, so that cooperative and team members truly made joining and leaving the cooperative and team voluntary. In the past, most people were not content with agricultural production and wanted to go outside; many farmers did not want land; now those who wanted to go outside no longer go, and some who had already gone outside have returned, and some who had given their land to others because of going outside are now asking for it back. The enthusiasm of the masses for production has been greatly improved.
    Fourth, all cadres have experienced the importance of learning to varying degrees. Some comrades found problems in their work and looked at documents to study solutions; they realized that they could not work without the documents. Even those who used to pay very little attention to learning have begun to change. Although most people failed this test, no one handed in a blank paper; even the new cadres who had just been transferred to work were able to answer one or two questions correctly. Therefore, there were fewer mistakes and deviations made by cadres in this work.
    In studying the central documents, there are still some serious problems:
    First, a portion of cadres, even individual department heads, have not seriously studied and delved into the three documents issued by the Central Committee as a guide for rural work. Judging from the 424 cadres who participated in the written and oral tests, the gains in learning are extremely unbalanced. In general, county-level agency cadres are better, district-level cadres are worse; key cadres are better, general cadres are worse; old cadres are better, new cadres are worse. Of the 380 cadres from 24 units who participated in the written test, only 94 passed. Calculated according to the average total score of each unit, only two units passed (one was the county committee, with an average score of 69.3; one was the county government, with an average score of 62.5); the remaining 22 units failed. None of the seven districts had an average score that passed; none of the cadres in the county armed forces department and the seventh district passed. Of the 39 cadres at the level of section chief and deputy section chief or above in county-level agencies, only 21 passed the written test. Of the 44 people who participated in the oral test, only about half answered correctly. Some responsible comrades are not as good as general cadres. For example, the deputy director of the county armed forces department failed, the director of the taxation bureau was not as good as the staff, and the head of the industry and commerce section was not as good as the staff member. This is a problem that should be solved in a timely manner.
    Second, judging from the test results, many comrades still have many mistakes in their understanding and viewpoints. For example, regarding the development prospects of the small-scale individual economy, some believe that farmers who do not participate in mutual aid and cooperation must be taking the capitalist road; some believe that individual farmers, even if they do not participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, will not take the capitalist road. Some believe that individual work is decentralism, creating disunity, not following the Communist Party, and should be restricted and attacked. Some believe that the rich peasant economy is not a capitalist economy. Some individual comrades even believe after studying the three documents that everything we did in the past was wrong. Some people believe that agricultural production cooperatives should not accumulate public property at all. Judging from these wrong answers, guiding cadres to comprehensively grasp the policies and overcome the one-sidedness of understanding problems in continuing study is also an important issue that should be paid attention to.
    Third, there are still many problems in the learning methods. A portion of cadres do not link their learning with their actual work and ideological realities. In learning, they always have one person read and everyone listen, or they just read individually, and after reading, they cannot raise any questions, let alone engage in discussion. Therefore, some people are not interested in learning. In particular, cadres in departments such as taxation, trade, and finance believe that these documents have little to do with their work, so they study extremely perfunctorily. In fact, these documents are very closely related to any cadres working in rural areas.
    Fourth, the county committee's propaganda department has not stipulated a regular system of tests, summaries, and inspections for learning, and sometimes it does not grasp it tightly enough, so some comrades are cold and hot in their learning, not frequent enough; especially cadres who go to the countryside cannot consistently adhere to the system of two hours of study per day, and learning is often in a free-flowing state.
    After conducting this test and inspection, in addition to posting a list of scores to express encouragement and criticism, the CCP Wuxiang County Committee has taken the following measures: (1) Stipulating that the three documents, including the Central Committee's Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation, will be used as documents for continuous and serious study in the future, combined with work. (2) After the enlarged cadre meeting, one day was set aside for the county committee to explain and organize discussions to help everyone correct wrong views and learn methods of comprehensively analyzing and studying problems. The county committee's propaganda department also formulated topics for research and discussion in future learning for everyone. (3) Stipulating that the learning method should be based on self-study, supplemented by organized group discussions; supplemented by necessary explanations. County committee members will be assigned to provide specific guidance in agencies and various districts, and help solve difficulties and problems in learning in a timely manner, and check the learning situation at any time. (4) Stipulating that regular summaries and tests will be conducted by season in the future; the county committee's propaganda department will conduct inspections, summaries, and exchanges of learning experience at any time.

    要做好农村工作就要好好学习三个文件
    ——武乡县县区干部学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等三个文件的收获和问题
    李纯仁  常维汉
    山西武乡县县区干部，从四月初开始学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示及人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键所在”。在这次学习中，多数干部克服了过去因为工作忙、没时间、不能认真钻研等思想，把三个文件作为指导农村工作的指南，认真地加以学习，因而在最紧张最繁忙的纠正盲目冒进偏向与全力领导春耕生产的季节，作到了一面工作、一面学习，在改进工作和提高干部思想上都收到了良好的效果。为了了解两个月来学习的成果和存在的问题，以便使学习再深入一步，在六月上旬县区扩大干部会议中，进行了一次测验和检查。
    这次学习是有一定的收获的：
    第一、多数干部认识了而且作到了把生产作为农村压倒一切的中心工作，初步克服了过去的平均主义、分散主义的作法。县委领导干部一方面严格控制了各种会议，另一方面改进了领导作风，深入到各区各村作具体指导，发现问题，解决问题。春耕中各区经常有一个县委直接指导，使问题能及时解决。各机关经常有一半以上干部下乡做实际工作，大大改变了以往单在机关里发指示、发表格、要材料的作法。各区区委采取了轮回检查的办法，区干部深入到村、社、组内了解情况，发现问题并帮助解决，大大减少了各村村干部与广大群众误工的现象。广大农民群众反映：“这才叫个真正搞好生产！像以前，就只是嘴上说说。”群众和村干部对县区干部更加信任、拥护了。第二、多数领导干部开始掌握了从实际出发，从小农经济特点出发的原则。大家正确地认识到过去对武乡县工作基础估计太高，要求太高，因而造成了合作互助运动中的盲目冒进偏向，产生了强迫命令的工作作风和打击歧视单干农民的错误。学习中央文件以后，县委结合武乡县的实际情况，积极稳当地纠正了武乡县互助合作运动中的盲目冒进倾向，把原有的一百六十六个农业生产合作社整顿为一百四十八个，对耕牛、羊群、农具等作价入社问题，除一部分耕牛农具在社员真正自愿的原则下仍保留为社的公有财产之外，绝大部分已经退给社员。各区村干部都抓住了一切从多打粮食增加收入出发的原则，改变了过去在社内组内过分强调集体和盲目摆大摊子的做法；在许多村采用了就地取材，就地推广的方法，进行了土地排队，算株算穗，总结出当地的丰产经验，用实例来教育群众，收效很大，合理密植做得较好。干部对待单干农民，也大都采取了积极领导、耐心帮助教育的态度。
    第三、过去不少干部不敢宣传保护农民所有权，特别是不敢宣传互助合作运动中的自愿原则，怕社、组散伙。经过学习，大部县区干部开始认识了农民个体经济在一个长时期内还将是大量存在的，认识了坚持巩固地联合中农的重要性，正确地并较完整地宣传贯彻了保护农民所有权及自愿两利等社会政策，纠正了过去流传的“三年合作化，五年集体化，家家都得入农业社”等错误说法；在处理互助合作问题上真正掌握了自愿两利原则，使社员组员真正作到了入社入组自愿，出社出组自由。过去多数人不安心农业生产，想到外边去；不少农民不要土地；现在要外出的不外出了，有些已经外出的也回来了，有些因外出把土地给了别人的，现在都往回要地。群众的生产积极性是大大提高了。
    第四、所有干部程度不同地都体会到了学习的重要性。有些同志在工作中发现问题，就看文件研究解决办法；认识到离开文件就无法工作。就是过去极不重视学习的人，也开始转变了。这次测验虽然有多数人不及格，但没有一个人交白卷子；就是刚调出来参加工作的新干部，也都能答对一题或两题。因此，在这段工作中干部犯错误与出偏差的较少。
    在学习中央文件中，还有一些严重的问题：
    第一、一部分干部，甚至有个别部门的负责同志，还没有把中央发布的三个文件当作农村工作的指南来认真地学习、钻研。从参加笔试和口试的四百二十四个干部看来，在学习收获上是极不平衡的。一般的是县级机关干部较好，区级干部较差；主要干部较好，一般干部较差；老干部较好，新干部较差。参加笔试的二十四个单位三百八十个干部中，及格的仅九十四人。按各单位总平均分数计算，及格的只有两个单位（一为县委会，平均分数六十九分点三；一为县政府，平均分数六十二分点五）；其余二十二个单位都不及格。七个区没有一个区平均分数及格；县武装部和第七区的干部连一个及格的都没有。县级机关正副科长级以上干部三十九人，笔试及格的只有二十一人。参加口试的四十四人，大部答对的约只一半。有些负责同志，还不如一般干部。如县武装部副部长不及格，税务局长不如股员，工商科长不如科员。这是应当及时解决的一个问题。
    第二、从测验结果来看，不少同志在认识上、观点上还有许多错误。如对小农个体经济的发展前途，有的认为不参加互助合作的农民就一定是走资本主义道路；有的认为个体农民虽不参加互助合作组织也走不到资本主义道路上去。有的认为单干就是分散主义、闹不团结，就是不跟上共产党走，应该加以限制、打击。有的认为富农经济不是资本主义经济。还有个别同志在学习三个文件后认为我们过去的工作一切都错了。有人认为农业生产合作社根本不应该积累公共财产。从这些错误的答案来看，在继续学习中引导干部全面地掌握方针政策，克服认识问题的片面性，也是应当注意的一个重要问题。
    第三、在学习方法上还有不少毛病。一部分干部在学习中不联系工作实际与思想实际，在学习中老是一人读大家听，或者只是个人念，读后也提不出什么问题，更展不开讨论。因此，就有些人对学习不感兴趣。尤其是税收、贸易、金融等部门的干部，自认为这些文件和他们的工作关系不大，所以学习得极为草率。其实这些文件和任何在农村作工作的干部都是有很密切的关系的。
    第四、县委宣传部门对于学习没有规定定期的测验、总结、检查制度，有时抓得不够紧，因而一些同志在学习上时冷时热，不够经常；尤其是下乡干部，始终不能坚持每天两小时学习的制度，学习时常处于自流状态。
    作了这次测验和检查之后，除按分数多少依次排列悬榜表示鼓励和批评以外，中共武乡县委采取了以下措施：（一）规定中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等三个文件为今后经常结合工作，认真继续学习的文件。（二）在扩大干部会议以后抽出了一天时间，由县委进行讲解，组织讨论，帮助大家纠正错误观点，学习全面地分析问题、研究问题的方法。县委宣传部并为大家拟定了今后学习中研究讨论的题目。（三）规定学习方法以自学为主，组织小组讨论；辅之以必要的讲解。由县委委员分工，在机关和各区具体指导，及时帮助解决学习中的困难和疑难问题，并随时检查学习情况。（四）规定今后按季节进行定期的总结测验；县委宣传部门随时进行检查，总结和交流学习经验。
