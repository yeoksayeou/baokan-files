    Consciously Abide by Labor Discipline, Always Thinking of Production
    Yang Maosen, Worker at the Wuhan LianGong Nail and Wire Factory
    In the old society, I had always worked as a cook in department stores. At that time, I was exhausted day and night, sweating buckets. After preparing the meals, I still had to serve the capitalists. In 1952, that department store transitioned into a nail and wire factory. When the transition first happened, I was still a cook. During the "Five-Anti" movement, I actively participated in the struggle. After the movement, everyone elected me as the director of the grassroots trade union, and my work was transferred from the kitchen to a production post, in charge of the chemical dipping vat. At this time, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions transferred me to a cadre school for a period of study. During this period, I received a great deal of education, which raised my class consciousness and made me understand many things I didn't understand before. Looking back at my work in the old society, I was always worried about losing my job, swallowing my anger and just trying to get by. Now, although I am still working in a private factory, our political status and living conditions are completely different. We no longer have to worry about unemployment. Moreover, the labor of us workers in private factories every day is also for increasing the wealth of the country, which is still a contribution to the country. After I returned to the factory from my studies, I focused on production in my own post. I am the director of the trade union, and I think that only if I play a model role in production can I motivate everyone to improve production. Usually, regardless of strong winds or heavy snow, I always come to the factory before work. I prepare everything myself first, get the tools ready, change my clothes, and start working hard as soon as work starts. When I get off work, I always let my comrades finish work before I go to wash my hands and rest. In the evening, I seize the time to handle some trade union affairs, or discuss issues with the work team and the capitalist, and discuss carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement in the factory. I always think: If the trade union work is not done well, production will not improve. I have never taken leave from production myself. Even when there are urgent matters at home, I am not willing to delay for a moment. Last winter, my sister-in-law (who is a widow) was critically ill in the countryside. Because she was single and had no one to take care of her, the rural peasant association wrote to me asking me to go back. However, I thought that the factory's production was tight and it would be bad to delay, so I asked my wife to go back. But she was not familiar with the route, so I had to take her to the boat early in the morning. I asked the factory for two hours' leave in advance. But in the evening, I thought it was still wrong. Even two hours of leave would delay production. My wife and I thought of a way. I sent her to Majia Lake in Hanyang at one o'clock in the morning to catch the boat. As a result, when I rushed back to the factory, it was not yet dawn, and the factory had not yet started work, so there was no delay at all. When the comrades in the factory saw me like this, many people were very moved and learned from my spirit of strictly abiding by labor discipline. Sometimes, if individual comrades had a bad work attitude or did not abide by labor discipline, I would criticize them. Once, a young worker was fine when he worked the day before, but he did not come to work the next day, and he did not ask for leave. When he came the third day, he said that he did not come because he was sick. I immediately educated him, asking him to ask for sick leave according to the regulations, and told him that not asking for leave was a violation of discipline. Later, that comrade accepted my opinion, made a self-criticism at the trade union membership meeting, and also made a guarantee. This also educated many other comrades in the factory. Everyone said that we are the leading class today, we should show some courage, consciously improve production, and not let the capitalists gossip.
    When the factory encounters difficulties in production, I always try my best to find ways to overcome them with my comrades, and unite the capitalists to overcome the difficulties together. Like this year after the Spring Festival, the factory had problems with the supply of raw materials. The capitalists were discouraged and disappointed, saying that they had encountered difficulties soon after the transition. They wanted to stop work and do nothing, simply sit and eat everything. A small number of worker comrades in the factory also wavered. When I saw that the situation was not right, I thought that sitting and eating everything would be very harmful to the country's production. I also believe that the government will still find ways to support this kind of private industry that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. I and several trade union members went to the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Municipal Government to inquire about the situation. As a result, we learned that the difficulties in our factory were short-term and could be overcome. After I had this in mind, I went back to call on all the comrades in the factory to work hard to increase production and reduce production costs to overcome the difficulties. In addition, I also discussed methods with the capitalist. The capitalist still said that the more he started work, the more he would lose money, and he would lose less money if he just sat and ate. So I went to the accountant to calculate a detailed account and showed it to the capitalist, and said that our workers would guarantee to increase production. If we started work, we could at least maintain expenses and would not lose money. As a result, the capitalist agreed. After the start of work, our output increased from 25 tons to 32 tons in March. Not only did we not lose money that month, but we also earned more than 30 million yuan, and we have had a surplus every month since then. This time, the capitalists were truly convinced by us. He said that the working class is really reliable. All the comrades in the factory also recognized their own strength. Everyone knows that only by working hard can we improve production and support the country's economic construction.

    自觉地遵守劳动纪律，处处为生产着想
    武汉联工钉丝厂工人  杨懋森
    在旧社会里我一直是在百货店里当厨工，那时候一天到晚累得黑汗直流，做了饭，还要服侍资本家。一九五二年那个百货店转业成了钉丝厂，刚转业时，我还是做厨工。在“五反”运动中我积极参加了斗争。运动结束后，大家把我选为基层工会的主任，我的工作也由厨房里调到生产岗位上担任浸药水缸的工作。这时，市总工会又把我调到干部学校去学习了一个时期，在这一段时间中，给我的教育很大，提高了我的阶级觉悟，使我懂得了许多以前自己不懂得的事情。回想以前在旧社会做工的时候，一天到晚耽心丢掉饭碗，忍气吞声混饭吃，现在虽然还是在私营工厂里做工，但我们的政治地位和生活条件就完全不同了，再也用不着耽心失业了。而且，我们私营工厂的工人每天劳动也是为了增加国家的财富，对国家还是有贡献的。我学习回厂后，在自己的岗位上，对生产抓得紧，我是工会主任，我想只有自己在生产上起模范作用，才能带动大伙把生产搞好。平常不管大风大雪，我总是在上工以前就到厂里来了，自己先做好准备工作，把工具弄好，衣服换好，一开工马上就紧张地干起来。下班的时候，我总是让同志们都收了工，才去洗手休息。晚上，我就抓紧时间去办工会的一些事情，或者和工作组及资方研究问题，商量在厂里开展增产节约运动的事。我时时都想到：要是工会工作不做好，生产还是搞不好的。我自己在生产上从来没有请过假，家里有紧急事情的时候，我也不肯耽搁一下。去年冬季，我的弟媳（是寡妇）在乡里病危了，因为她是单身一人，没有人照料，乡里农会写信来要我回去一下，但是我想着厂里生产很紧，不好耽搁，就叫我妻子回去。但她又不熟悉路径，要我清早送她去搭船，我就在事先向厂里请了两点钟的假。但是晚上我一想还是不对，就是两个钟头的假也要耽误生产的。我就和妻子想了一个法子，头一天半夜一点钟就送她到汉阳马家湖去搭船，结果赶回厂时天还没亮，厂里还没有上工，一点都没有耽误。厂里同志们看见我这样，好些人都很感动，都学习我严格遵守劳动纪律的精神。有时候个别同志劳动态度不好或者是不遵守劳动纪律，我就提出批评。有一次，一个青工头一天做工时人还好好的，第二天却没有来上工，也没有请假，第三天他来的时候说是因为害病没有来。我当时就教育他，要他按照规定请病假，并告诉他不请假是违犯纪律的。后来那个同志接受了我的意见，在工会会员大会上作了检讨，还提出了保证。这样也教育了厂里其他许多同志。大家都说，我们今天是领导阶级，应该拿点气魄出来，自觉地把生产搞好，不要让资方说闲话。
    厂里生产碰到困难的时候，我总是尽量想办法和同志们一起去克服，团结资本家来一起度过困难。像今年春节以后，厂里因为原料供应发生问题，资本家灰心失望，说转业不久就遇到难关，想停工不干，干脆坐着吃光了算事。厂里有少数工人同志们也动摇了。我一看情形不对，坐着吃光，对国家的生产该多有害。我也相信政府对这种于国计民生有利的私营工业还是要设法扶持的，就和几个工会委员们一路到工商局、市政府去打听情况，结果知道了我们厂的困难是短期的，可以克服。我心里有了底之后，就回去一面号召全厂同志们努力提高产量，降低生产成本，克服困难，另外又和资方商量办法。资方还是说越开工越赔本，坐着吃还少赔几个，于是我又去找会计算了个细账拿给资方看，并且说我们工人保证提高产量，开了工至少可以维持开支，不会赔本，结果资方同意了。开工之后，三月份我们的产量从二十五吨提高到了三十二吨，那个月不但没有赔本，还赚了三千多万元，以后月月有盈余。这一下，资方才真正信服了我们，他说，工人阶级硬是有板眼。全厂同志也认清了自己的力量。大家都晓得了只有努力干活，才能把生产搞好，才能支援国家的经济建设。
