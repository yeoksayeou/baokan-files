Strengthen Current Grain Storage Work
Technical Office of the Storage and Transportation Administration Bureau of the Central Grain Department

    Overview of Grain Storage Work in Various Regions

    With the arrival of the rainy season, grain storage work has entered a tense stage. This year, grain departments at all levels promoted the experience of checking warehouses to protect grain, and generally carried out warehouse checks, creating effective working methods and achieving considerable success in grain storage. However, the development of grain storage work varies greatly from place to place, and some grain insect infestation and mold spoilage incidents also occurred in the second quarter. Some places accumulated old grain or high-moisture grain for extended periods without handling them, leading to spoilage incidents. Some areas did not inspect grain storage conditions for a long time, and were unaware of grain molding. Some cooperatives and grain bureaus, knowing that grain had already become moldy, shirked responsibility and refused to turn and sun it, resulting in grain spoilage. In some places, due to dispatching units shipping high-moisture grain, or packing and shipping freshly processed hot rice, coupled with poor management during transportation and a lack of management experience on the part of the receiving units, or the reliance on sales units for temporary management, grain insect infestation and mold phenomena occurred.

    In addition, some grassroots grain depot cadres are not dedicated to their work, believing that "there is no future in grain work," some even saying: "Grain depot cadres have two paths: work actively, go to the hospital; work passively, go to court." These people are unwilling to delve into and strive to improve their work, whether in storage or transportation, which greatly affects the further development of the business.

    Three Characteristics of Current Grain Storage Work

    1.  Grain storage work is seasonal. The third quarter is the high-temperature season. The rainy season in East China, Southwest China, and other places has not yet passed. Coastal areas are subject to typhoons and heavy rains at any time, and there is a risk of mountain floods, river flooding, and tidal surges endangering grain depots. This intensifies the severity of the grain storage task.

    2.  This year, some wheat-producing areas suffered frost and hail damage. Although local Party and government organs mobilized the masses to vigorously salvage the crops, the grain kernel fullness is not as good as in previous years, and the moisture content of some wheat is also high. This grain is even more difficult to store.

    3.  To regulate market needs, a large amount of grain must be transported over long distances in the future. This requires breaking away from past regional storage experience and doing a good job in storage during long-distance transportation. When grain is transported from the Northeast to East China, or rice is transported from the South to the North, the storage methods must be different due to climate differences. New storage methods must be studied. In the past, some grain was not properly protected against heating, spoilage, and insect infestation during long-distance transportation. Therefore, although the grain was good when it was shipped, it had already become hot, caked, or infested with insects upon arrival at its destination. In the future, special attention must be paid to the storage of large quantities of grain during long-distance transportation.

    Several Points to Note for Current Grain Storage Work

    In view of the above situation, the following points should be noted in current grain storage work:

    1.  Actively handle old grain and high-moisture grain. During the high-temperature and humid season of the third quarter, old grain and high-moisture grain are prone to mold and insect infestation. On the basis of past grain quality surveys, various regions can conduct another detailed grain ranking, finding out how much old grain and high-moisture grain each depot, county, and province has, and quickly handle it. Old grain should be sold at price to promote the new and store the new. High-moisture grain should be vigorously dried.

    2.  In grain transfer and transportation work, it is necessary to overcome departmentalism, sort out insect-infested, moldy, and damp grain before transferring it out, and do a good job in preventing rain, leaks, moisture, and ventilation during transportation. High-moisture grain should be turned and dried in a timely manner before being transferred to cities. Insect-infested grain is usually found on the surface, around, and at the bottom of the grain pile. The dispatching unit should first remove and treat the insect-infested grain and not mix it with good grain when packing, which can basically avoid the spread of insect infestation.

    During long-distance transportation, attention must be paid to rain protection in train carriages, leak prevention in ship holds, and moisture protection during transshipment. A responsible and detailed inspection of loading and transportation tools should be carried out before shipment to eliminate all possibilities of rainwater intrusion. In the past, ventilation of grain piles in train carriages and ship holds generally did not receive enough attention. Grain work cadres and transportation work cadres in various regions should study this carefully, using the wind force when trains and ships are moving or docked to ventilate and exchange air in grain cars and grain ships as much as possible without affecting transportation and navigation safety, regulating grain temperature, and avoiding heating and mold.

    3.  When grain enters the warehouse, do a good job in cleaning, disinfecting, and storing by grade. This is the key to doing a good job in new grain storage. Although various regions have done cleaning and disinfection work in the past, most of them have not been thorough enough, so warehouse insects are still rampant this year. Some cadres lack confidence in eliminating insect pests because they believe that insect damage is a historical and universal phenomenon, which is wrong. The Zhejiang Provincial Grain Department has transformed a warehouse with poor conditions and severe insect damage into an "insect-free warehouse," which is a good example. In carrying out cleaning and disinfection work, various regions can also adopt this method, cultivate typical examples, conduct demonstrations, and expand influence.

    Inspecting grain before it enters the warehouse and storing it by grade can not only avoid the spread of insect and mold spoilage, but also promptly handle unsafe grain separately. Grain quality ranking must also be carried out on the basis of graded storage in order to be more effective.

    4.  Cooperatives are responsible for protecting the grain they manage on behalf of others, establishing a system of special personnel in charge and regular inspections, and strengthening storage operations. Grain departments should also establish an overall concept, eliminate the idea of relying on entrusted management contracts, actively assist cooperatives in carrying out grain protection operations, and provide specific guidance on grading storage, cleaning and disinfection before entering the warehouse, stacking methods, and inspection methods during the storage period. In grain transfer, processing, and handling, grain departments should consider cooperative grain storage as a whole, prioritize those in urgent need, and work together to store grain well.

    5.  Grain leading organs at all levels should attach importance to solving the ideological problems of grain depot cadres, listen to the opinions of lower-level, especially grassroots cadres, improve leadership methods, and improve the working, learning, and living conditions of grassroots grain depot cadres as much as possible; those who work hard and delve into their work should be commended and rewarded, so that every cadre can clearly see the future of grain work, so that grain depot cadres can establish professional thinking and do a better job in grain storage operations.

    加强当前的粮食保管工作
    中央粮食部储运管理局技术室
    各地粮食保管工作概况
    雨季到来，粮食保管工作进入紧张阶段。今年各级粮食部门推广查仓保粮的经验，比较普遍地开展了查仓工作，并创造了一些有效的工作方法，在粮食保管工作上取得不少成绩。但各地保管粮食工作发展很不平衡，第二季度也发生了一些粮食虫蚀霉变事故。有的地方把陈粮或高水分粮食积压起来，久不处理，造成霉烂事故。有些地区长期不检查储粮情况，粮食发霉还不知道。有些合作社和粮食局明知粮食已经霉变，但却互相推诿不肯翻晒，以致粮食霉烂了。有些地方因为发运单位调出高水分粮，或将刚加工的热机米装包发运，在运输途中又管理不善，加以接粮单位缺乏管理经验，或存在着依靠销售单位临时管理的观点，以致发生粮食虫霉现象。
    此外，有些基层粮库干部不安心工作，认为“粮食工作没有前途”，有的甚至说：“粮库干部两条路：积极干，进病院；消极干，进法院”。这些人不论在保管工作或运输工作上，都不肯深入钻研与力求改进，这就大大地影响了业务的进一步开展。
    目前粮食保管工作中的三个特点
    一、粮食保管工作是有季节性的。第三季度是高温季节，华东、西南等地的雨季尚未过去，沿海一带随时可能遭受台风暴雨的袭击，发生山洪暴发，江水泛滥，海潮倒灌危及粮仓的事故。这就加重了粮食保管任务的严重性。
    二、今年部分小麦产区曾遭受霜雹灾害，虽经当地党政机关发动群众大力挽救，但粮食籽粒的饱满程度已不如往年，部分小麦含水量也较大。这些粮食更加不易保管。
    三、为了调剂市场的需要，今后大量粮食必需实行长途运输，这就要打破过去区域性的保管经验，并做好长途运输中的保管工作。东北粮食运到华东，南方大米运到北方，由于气候不同，它们的保管方法也就不同，必须研究新的保管办法。过去有些粮食在长途运输中因为没有做好发热、变质、虫蚀的预防工作，所以虽然发运时粮食尚好，但到达目的地后，粮食已经发热、结块或虫蚀了。今后必须特别注意大量粮食在长途运输中的保管工作。
    目前粮食保管上应注意的几项
    工作
    从上述情况看来，目前粮食保管工作应注意下列几项工作：
    一、积极处理陈粮及高水分粮，在第三季度高温多湿的季节里，陈粮及高水分粮很容易霉变生虫，各地可在过去粮质普查的基础上，再进行一次细致的粮食排队，查出各库、各县、各省究竟有多少陈粮和高水分粮，迅速予以处理。陈粮应按价出售，以便推陈储新；高水分粮应大力曝晒。
    二、在粮食调运工作上，必须克服本位主义思想，将虫霉和潮湿粮加以整理然后外调，并做好运输途中的防雨、防漏、防潮、通风工作。高水分粮应在调往城市前及时翻晒。虫害粮普通均在粮堆表层或四周、底部，发运单位应把虫害粮先行取出处理，不要和好粮混合装包，这样即可基本上避免虫害的蔓延。
    长途运输中须注意车厢防雨，船舱防漏，转口防潮工作，发运前对装运工具应进行负责的、细致的检查，杜绝雨水侵入的一切可能。对于车厢、船舱中粮堆的通风工作，过去一般注意不够，各地粮食工作干部和运输工作干部要很好地进行钻研，利用车船前进或停泊时的风力，在不影响运输和航行安全的原则下，尽可能使粮车、粮船通风换气，调节粮温，避免发热霉变。
    三、粮食入库时，要做好清仓消毒和分等储存工作，这是做好新粮保管的关键。过去各地虽然作了清仓消毒工作，但大部作得不够彻底，以致今年的仓虫仍很猖獗。有些干部因仓虫为害系历史性的普遍现象，竟对消灭虫害缺乏信心，这是不对的。浙江省粮食厅曾把一个条件较差、虫害严重的仓库改变成为“无虫库”，就是一个很好的例子。各地在开展清仓消毒工作中，也可采用这一办法，培养典型，进行示范，扩大影响。
    粮食进仓前先行检验，分等储存，既可以避免虫害霉变的蔓延，又能及时分别处理不安全粮。粮质排队工作也须在分等储存的基础上进行，才能更加有效。
    四、合作社对于代管的粮食要负保护之责，建立专人负责与经常检查的制度，加强保管业务。粮食部门也应该树立整体观念，扫除依靠代管合约的思想，主动协助合作社开展保粮业务，对进仓前分等储存，清仓消毒，堆置方法及储藏期中的检查方法，都应予以具体指导。粮食部门在粮食的调运加工处理上，应把合作社存粮一并加以考虑，先处理急要者，共同为保管好粮食而努力。
    五、各级粮食领导机关要重视解决粮库干部的思想问题，要倾听下级特别是基层干部的意见，改进领导方法，并尽可能地改善基层粮库干部的工作、学习、生活条件；对埋头苦干，钻研业务的同志予以表扬和奖励，使每个干部都能明确地看到粮食工作的前途，使粮库干部树立专业化思想，把粮食保管业务做得更好。
