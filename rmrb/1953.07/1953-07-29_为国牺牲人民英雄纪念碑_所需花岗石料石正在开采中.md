    Granite Quarrying Underway

    The granite quarrying project in Fushan District, Qingdao, for the "Monument to the People's Heroes Who Sacrificed for the Country" to be built in Tiananmen Square in the capital, is underway. As of mid-July, 70% of the granite needed for the monument has been quarried, and the 125-ton stele body is nearing completion.

    The granite from Fushan District, Qingdao, has a soft and lustrous color and is durable after polishing. It is one of China's famous granite production areas. In June 1952, the Capital People's Heroes Monument Construction Committee sent investigation teams to various parts of the country to collect stone samples. After research, it was determined that all granite for the monument would be quarried in the Fushan area of Qingdao. In September of last year, all employees of the No. 1 Quarry of the state-owned Qingdao Building Materials Company accepted this glorious quarrying task and immediately started full-scale construction. In the process of quarrying, all employees of the No. 1 Quarry realized that their happy life today was bought with the lives and blood of countless heroic revolutionary martyrs. Therefore, everyone unanimously expressed their determination to inherit the heroic and striving revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, overcome all difficulties, and ensure the completion of the stone quarrying task.

    To date, a total of more than 600 square meters, weighing more than 1,600 tons, of stone for the monument's base, stele body, and part of the platform and railings have been quarried, initially processed, and transported to Beijing. The 125-ton large stone for the stele body is completing the final rough processing and is preparing for transport. The remaining stone is still being quarried.

    “为国牺牲人民英雄纪念碑”
    所需花岗石料石正在开采中
    在首都天安门前广场兴建“为国牺牲人民英雄纪念碑”所需用的花岗石料石开采工程，正在青岛浮山区进行中。到七月中旬为止，纪念碑所需百分之七十的花岗石料石已经开采完毕，其中重达一百二十五吨的碑身已接近完工。
    青岛浮山区的花岗石色泽柔和光润，磨光后质坚耐久，是我国著名的花岗石出产地之一。一九五二年六月间，首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会曾派出调查组分赴全国各地搜集石样，后经研究确定：纪念碑所用的花岗石料石都选定在青岛浮山地区开采。去年九月间，国营青岛建筑材料公司第一料石场全体职工接受了这一光荣的开采任务，并立即全面动工。在开采过程中，第一料石场全体职工认识到今天自己的幸福生活，是英勇牺牲的无数革命先烈用自己的生命和热血所换来的，因此，大家一致表示要继承烈士们英勇奋发的革命精神，战胜一切困难，保证料石开采任务的完成。
    到目前为止，纪念碑的碑座、碑身及一部分月台、栏杆等料石，共计六百多平方公尺，重一千六百多吨，已开采完毕并经初步加工运往北京；一百二十五吨的碑身大料石正在完成最后的荒料加工并准备进行运搬工作；其余的料石仍在继续开采中。
