Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. Under the intensified exploitation by Japanese monopoly capital, work-related accidents and deaths of Japanese workers are increasing year by year.

Even according to official statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Labor, work-related accidents and deaths of Japanese workers have greatly increased since the war. The number of workers who died in work-related accidents in 1948 was 2,870, which drastically increased to 4,361 in 1951. If the number of injuries is included, it has reached 550,000. According to statistics, in coal mines, an average of one and a half workers die every day due to work-related accidents.

Japanese monopoly capital has recently been even more forceful in launching the so-called "Industrial Safety Week" campaign in factories and mines, further exploiting workers' extra labor and reducing the living security for those injured in work-related accidents, leading to even more accidents and deaths. A worker at the Muroran factory of Japan Steel Corporation said, "The safety campaign has become increasingly intense recently. At its worst, there are three safety campaigns in a row. Workers are ordered to engage in labor outside of working hours such as cleaning corridors and installing frames around machines." Furthermore, "In the past, a scratch from a machine could be counted as a work-related injury, but now, unless the injury requires three days of rest to heal, it is difficult to be considered a work-related injury." Workers at the Kawasaki Iron Works of Japan Steel Pipe Company have no guarantee of safety in production either. If a worker is injured and receives treatment for a work-related injury, they will either not receive a bonus or their production performance will be lowered. Therefore, workers have to endure the injuries by applying some mercurochrome themselves. The workers at Kawasaki Iron Works said that due to the Korean War, military orders have increased, and workers are forced to intensify their labor, resulting in more and more injuries. They also pointed out that the company is using "safety competitions" to establish a wartime system in the factory.

### 在日本垄断资本加紧压榨下  日本工人伤亡事故逐年增加

    在日本垄断资本加紧压榨下
    日本工人伤亡事故逐年增加
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：在日本垄断资本的加紧压榨下，日本工人的劳动伤亡事故一年年增加。
    即使根据日本劳动省的官方统计，战后日本工人的劳动伤亡事故也大为增加。在工作中因意外事件而死亡的工人人数，一九四八年是二千八百七十人，一九五一年已激增到四千三百六十一人，如果加上负伤人数，已达到五十五万人。据统计，在煤矿里，平均每天有一个半工人因为劳动事故而丧命。
    日本垄断资本最近更强迫在工厂和矿场中发动所谓“产业安全周”的运动，进一步剥削工人的额外劳动，并减少因劳动事故负伤的生活保障，使伤亡事故更加增多。日本制钢公司室兰工厂的工人说：“安全运动最近越来越激烈了，最厉害的时候，连续来三个安全运动。命令工人在工作时间以外从事打扫走廊和在机器周围安装框子等劳动”。并且，“以前被机器擦伤就可以算做公伤，可是现在除非休息三天才能好的伤势，就很难算作公伤。”日本钢管公司川崎制铁所的工人，在生产安全方面同样没有保障。工人如果负伤后接受公伤治疗时，不是拿不到奖金就是生产成绩被压低，所以工人们负了伤也只好自己涂上点红药水忍受下去。川崎制铁所的工人们说：由于朝鲜战争，军事订货增加，工人被迫加强劳动，因此负伤越来越多。他们并指出，公司又利用“安全竞赛”，想在工厂里建立战时体制。
