    Many major state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region, upon entering the work of establishing and improving planned management, have successively mobilized the masses to conduct focused inspections and rectifications of original record-keeping work.
    Based on the situations revealed by the inspections in various factories and mines, with the exception of a small number of factories such as Factory 101 and Sichuan Cement Plant, where the original record-keeping work was done relatively well, the original records in most factories and mines were incomplete, inaccurate, and not comprehensive. The No. 1 Well of the 405 Coal Mine, based on material consumption statistics made at the end of March this year according to original records, concluded that 6,943 sections of timber should be in stock underground. The conclusion drawn from this was that material consumption in February and March had decreased significantly compared to previous months. However, after the materials department sent people down the well to check, it was found that only a few hundred sections of timber were actually in stock, and the remaining 6,000-plus sections of timber had already been used up in February and March. Another example is that the scales at the No. 4 workshop of Factory 102 were inaccurate, and a certain amount of steel ingots had undergone phenomena where, after blanking and rolling, the weight of the steel was more than the steel blank, and the steel blank more than the steel ingot. Yet another example is that in the No. 610 Cotton Mill, shift A spun more, had a low absentee rate, and less waste cotton, while shift B spun less, had the same absentee rate, and more waste cotton, but the output recorded in the original records was the same. Due to these shortcomings in the original records, problems in production and production management cannot be reflected comprehensively, promptly, and truthfully, and the original records in many factories and mines fail to play a positive role in production.
    Why is the chaotic state of original record-keeping work so serious? The main reason is that original record-keeping work is basically in a state of no one being responsible for it in most factories and mines. The leading cadres of these factories and mines have not recognized the significant role of original record-keeping work in production, and therefore adopt a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to original record-keeping work. From the mine level to the well level in the 405 Coal Mine, leading cadres have not conducted publicity and education among workers regarding original records, lack ideological and professional leadership for the original recorders; have not conducted supervision and inspection of original record-keeping work; and have not made efforts to solve the problem of necessary measuring tools and instruments. Original recorders are generally not content with their work, believing that doing this work "has no future," and are perfunctory and irresponsible in their work. Workers do not know what the significance of original records is. The relationship between original recorders and workers is also not normal enough. Some workers only like recorders to record achievements, do not like them to record shortcomings, and even distort the true situation, reporting false figures to original recorders; some recorders, in order to please individual backward workers, also do not record the true situation. In addition to this, other factors such as too many reports, overly complex content, lack of measuring tools and instruments, and only relying on estimated records are some of the reasons why original record-keeping work is not done well.
    These problems existing in original record-keeping work have begun to attract the attention of leaders in many factories and mines, and generally, in the second quarter of this year, they have successively mobilized the masses to conduct focused rectification of original record-keeping work. According to the preliminary experiences of a small number of factories that have done well, such as 102, 602, and Kunming Smelter, the primary link in rectifying and strengthening original record-keeping work is to conduct ideological education, solve the ideological problems of original recorders, and correct the understanding of leaders and the masses of original record-keeping work. And, through typical examples of the adverse consequences brought to production and production management by incomplete, untimely, and inaccurate original records in each factory, it is explained that if original record-keeping work is not done well, production will be seriously affected, and planned management cannot be implemented, arousing the attention of the broad masses of workers to this work. In the process of conducting ideological education, the leaders also combined it with criticizing the past mistakes of not paying attention to original record-keeping work, expressing that they will grasp this work firmly in the future. This has greatly changed the views of many people on original record-keeping work and encouraged the majority of original recorders. On this basis, rectification was carried out. Workers were mobilized to expose the problems existing in original record-keeping work, and various reports were collected for inspection, the inspection by the work team and the exposure by the masses were comprehensively analyzed and studied, and according to the needs of workshop production and the requirements of various functional departments, they were sorted out and adjusted, unnecessary items were reduced, and new items that were needed were added. After preliminary sorting, the No. 4 workshop of Factory 102 streamlined ten types of reports and established nine types of reports that were more adapted to production needs. In the No. 602 factory's rewinder production records, the loss column originally only had the total loss amount, and it was impossible to see the loss of papermaking waste and calendaring. After improvement, the new records can not only reflect the rewinder loss rate, but also find out which section is causing the most paper loss. The No. 4 workshop of Factory 102 stipulated the procedures and methods for original records, determined the responsibility system and working relationships of the "six members" of the workshop, determined the supply relationship and scope of information, and also formulated learning and reward and punishment systems. The No. 602 factory stipulates that the workshop economic accounting group will submit a summary report on the workshop's original record-keeping work to the factory's economic accounting center group every month; the entire factory holds a meeting of original recorders once a month to exchange work experience and carry out commendation and criticism. After such improvements in ideology, organization, working methods, systems, and equipment, a new atmosphere has begun to appear in the original record-keeping work in these factories. Many workers consciously demand to assist recorders in making original records accurate and complete. Original recorders have also settled down and begun to develop an interest in their work.
    However, at present, most state-owned factories and mines have not done the work of rectifying and strengthening original record-keeping deeply and practically enough. The leaders of many factories and mines still do not pay enough attention to this work and have not used enough strength to lead it; some factories and mines neglect ideological education and only focus on rectifying table systems, etc.; some do not emphasize the combination of workers and original recorders, and simply educate original record-keeping personnel. The leading cadres of these factories and mines must attach importance to this work and earnestly strengthen leadership so that original record-keeping work can play a role in promoting production.

    西南区许多主要的国营厂矿
    检查和整顿原始记录工作
    西南区许多主要国营厂矿，在进入建立和健全计划管理工作中，先后发动群众对原始记录工作有重点地进行了检查，并加以整顿。
    根据各厂矿所检查出的情况来看，除一零一厂、四川水泥厂等少数厂原始记录工作作得比较好外，多数厂矿原始记录都不全面、不完整、不准确。四零五煤矿一井在今年三月底依据原始记录所作的材料消耗统计数字，井下应结存六千九百四十三节木料，据此得出的结论是：二、三两月份的材料消耗比以前各月份大大降低；但是经过材料部门派人下井去检查的结果，实际上只结存数百节木料，其余的六千多节木料在二、三两月内早已用完了。又如一零二厂四场磅秤不准，曾经发生过一定数量的钢锭经过开胚、轧制后，钢材重量反多于钢胚、钢胚多于钢锭的现象。又如六一零纱厂甲班锭时做得多，出勤率不多，白花较少，乙班锭时做得少，出勤率一样，白花较多，而结果原始记录上的产量却是一样的。由于原始记录存在的这些缺点，生产和生产管理中的问题便不能全面地、及时地、如实地反映出来，原始记录在许多厂矿中起不到对生产的积极作用。
    原始记录工作中的混乱现象为什么会这样严重呢？主要是原始记录工作在多数厂矿中基本上处于无人负责的状态。这些厂矿的领导干部没有认识到原始记录工作对生产的重大作用，因而对原始记录工作采取不闻不问的官僚主义的态度。四零五煤矿从矿一级到井一级的领导干部，都没有向职工进行过有关原始记录的宣传教育工作，对原始记录员缺乏思想领导与业务领导；对原始记录工作没有进行过督促与检查；必需的量具仪器也不设法解决；原始记录员普遍不安心工作，认为作这一工作“没有前途”，工作时马虎从事，不负责任。工人不知道原始记录有什么意义。原始记录员和工人之间的关系也不够正常，有些工人只喜欢记录员记出成绩，不喜欢记出缺点，甚至歪曲真实情况，向原始记录员报告假数字；一些记录员为了讨好个别落后工人，也不记上真实情况。除此而外，其他如报表过多，内容过于繁杂；缺乏量具仪器，只凭估计记录等，都是原始记录工作作不好的一些原因。
    原始记录工作中存在的这些问题，已开始引起了许多厂矿领导上的注意，一般都在今年第二季中先后发动群众对原始记录工作进行了重点整顿。根据作得较好的少数厂如一零二、六零二、昆明冶炼厂等的初步经验，整顿和加强原始记录工作的首要环节，是进行思想教育工作，解决原始记录员的思想问题，端正领导上和群众对原始记录工作的认识。并通过各该厂由于原始记录不完整、不及时、不准确而给生产和生产管理带来恶果的典型事例，说明原始记录工作作得不好，生产就会受到严重影响，计划管理便不能贯彻实行，引起广大职工对这一工作的重视。在进行思想教育工作中，领导上也结合批判了过去对原始记录工作不重视的错误，表示今后要抓紧这一工作。这样，大大改变了许多人对原始记录工作的看法，鼓舞了大部分原始记录人员。在这个基础上进行了整顿。发动职工揭发原始记录工作中存在的问题，搜集各种报表进行检查，把工作组的检查和群众的揭发综合进行分析研究，根据车间生产的需要和各职能部门的要求，加以整理调整，减去不必要的项目，增加需要的新项目。一零二厂四场经过初步整理后精简了十种报表，建立了比较适应生产需要的九种报表。六零二厂重卷机生产记录中损失栏原来只有总损失量，不能看出抄造废纸及压光的损失，经改进后，新的记录不仅能反映重卷机损失率，并可据此找出损纸多是那一工段的毛病。一零二厂四场规定了原始记录的程序方法，确定车间“六员”的责任制和工作关系，确定资料的供给关系与范围，还订出学习和奖惩等制度。六零二厂规定车间经济核算小组每月将车间原始记录工作向厂经济核算中心小组做总结报告；全厂每月召开一次原始记录员会议，交流工作经验，并展开表扬与批评。经过这样从思想上、组织上、工作方法上、制度上以及设备上的改进，这些厂中原始记录工作已开始出现新的气象。不少工人都自觉要求协助记录员把原始记录做得精确、完整。原始记录员也安心下来，开始对工作发生兴趣。
    但是，目前大部分国营厂矿整顿和加强原始记录的工作还做得很不深入和踏实。许多厂矿领导上对这一工作还不够重视，没有用足够的力量去加以领导；有些厂矿忽略思想教育工作，只着重整顿表格制度等；有些则没有强调工人与原始记录员之间的结合，单纯教育原始记录人员。这些厂矿的领导干部，必须重视这一工作，切实加强领导，使原始记录工作能起到推动生产的作用。
