Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: TASS Moscow, July 14th: The Soviet chess team, which originally planned to hold a match with the American chess team in New York on July 15th, returned to Moscow from Paris on July 14th.

As reported in the newspapers, the American authorities insisted that the Soviet chess players accept the condition that they could not leave New York City. During the day, and each time with the permission of the immigration authorities, they could go to the country villa of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations in Glen Cove, but could not spend the night there.

Despite the protests from the Soviet Chess Federation and the Soviet chess players against these restrictions, the American authorities refused to lift them. Therefore, the Soviet chess players considered it impossible to go to New York to participate in the chess match.

    由于美当局拒绝取消无理的限制
    苏联象棋队自巴黎返莫斯科
    【新华社十六日讯】  塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：原拟于七月十五日在纽约与美国象棋队举行比赛的苏联象棋队七月十四日自巴黎回到了莫斯科。
    如报纸所报道的，美国当局强要苏联象棋选手接受，不得离开纽约城的条件。在白天，而且每一次要得到移民当局的许可，才能到格林克夫苏联驻联合国代表团的乡间别墅去，并且不得在那里过夜。
    不顾苏联象棋联合会和苏联象棋选手对这些限制的抗议，美国当局还是拒绝取消这些限制。因此，苏联象棋选手认为不可能到纽约去参加象棋比赛。
