Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 23rd: The German News Agency, Berlin, reported on the 22nd that the Soviet High Commissioner in Germany, V.S. Semyonov, wrote to the US High Commissioner in Germany, Conant, regarding the US government's so-called food transportation to Berlin issue.

The letter stated: In recent days, the US occupying authorities in West Berlin have opened special sales stations near the inter-district border, staffed by fascists as salespeople. Due to mass protests by the unemployed in West Berlin, the selling of goods to East Berliners had to be suspended. According to newspaper reports, preparations are now underway to open various new sales stations. This behavior cannot but be seen as a continued attempt, for provocative purposes, to buy off fascist mercenaries and criminals, who actively participated in the provocations of June 17th, arson, and looting of shops, etc.

Semyonov pointed out in the letter: The 1.3 million unemployed in West Germany and the nearly 200,000 unemployed in West Berlin live miserable lives. However, the US government does not care about them, nor about the millions who are starving and living on pensions or with only short-term jobs. The US government does not provide them with food. All this proves that the measures recently planned by the US occupying authorities in Berlin do not meet the minimum prerequisites for maintaining public order. It is not normal for the US occupying authorities to use all kinds of criminals to achieve their goals, not to mention that such behavior may ultimately be detrimental to these occupying authorities themselves.

Semyonov finally insisted that the US High Commissioner in Germany immediately take measures to avoid the recurrence of the above-mentioned illegal acts.

    美国故意在柏林区际边界地方开设旨在挑衅的特别售货站
    苏联驻德高级专员斥美国当局的非法行为
    【新华社二十三日讯】德意志通讯社柏林二十二日讯：苏联驻德高级专员维·斯·谢麦诺夫就美国政府的所谓运送食物给柏林问题写信给美国驻德高级专员康南特。
    信中说：最近几天以来，美国驻西柏林占领当局在靠近区际边界的地方开设了特别售货站，由法西斯分子充当售货员。由于西柏林失业者的群众性的抗议，卖东西给东柏林人的事情不得不中止。据报纸报道，现在又在准备着开设各种新的售货站。这种行为不能不被认为是继续企图为了挑衅的目的而收买法西斯雇佣分子和犯罪分子，这些人曾积极地参加了六月十七日的挑衅，纵火焚烧房屋和抢劫商店等等。
    谢麦诺夫在信中指出：西德的一百三十万失业者和西柏林的将近二十万失业者过着悲惨的生活。但是美国政府却不关心他们，也不关心成百万忍饥挨饿的依靠领取年金过活或只有短期工作做的人。美国政府不把食物供给他们。这一切证明，美国驻柏林占领当局最近所筹划的措施是不符合于维持公共秩序的最起码的前提的。美国占领当局为了达到他们的目的而使用形形色色的犯罪分子，这是不合乎正常情况的，姑且不说这种行为最终可能对这些占领当局本身也发生不利。
    谢麦诺夫最后坚持要求美国驻德高级专员立即采取措施避免再发生上述非法行为。
