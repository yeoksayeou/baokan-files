Xinhua News Agency, July 28th—The South Korean Syngman Rhee government has issued a statement claiming that it will not allow representatives from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission member states of India, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, Indian armed forces, Indian Red Cross personnel, and representatives and observers from the North Korean and Chinese side to enter South Korean territory to carry out the tasks assigned to them by the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," which was agreed upon and signed by the North Korean and Chinese side and the United Nations Command side. In response, the North Korean and Chinese side have issued the following two-point statement to the five neutral nations of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland: (1) The North Korean and Chinese side will absolutely not recognize the aforementioned statement made by the South Korean Syngman Rhee government, which completely violates the bilateral agreement; (2) The North Korean and Chinese side firmly believes that, in accordance with the agreement on the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," neutral nations personnel and representatives from the North Korean and Chinese side have the full right to enter and pass through South Korea in order to carry out the tasks stipulated in the "Scope of Authority," and have the right to be protected by the United Nations Command, including the South Korean army; therefore, the United Nations Command, including the South Korean army, must not shirk their responsibility to provide protection.

    朝中方面向五中立国作两点声明
    【新华社二十八日讯】南朝鲜李承晚政府曾发表声明称，它将不容许中立国遣返委员会成员印度、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克三国代表、印度武装力量、印度红十字会人员及朝中方面解释代表与观察代表进入南朝鲜境内，去执行朝中方面与联合国军方面业已协议并签字的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所交付给他们的任务。对此，朝中方面已向印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典与瑞士等五中立国提出如下的两点声明：（一）朝中方面对于南朝鲜李承晚政府所作的上述与双方协议完全违反的声明，绝不予以承认；（二）朝中方面坚决认为：按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议，中立国人员与朝中方面代表，为执行“职权范围”所规定的任务，完全有权进入和通过南朝鲜，并有权受到联合国军包括南朝鲜军队的保护；因此联合国军包括南朝鲜军队绝不能推卸其应负的保护责任。
