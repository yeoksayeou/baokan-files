    The Party and Victory
    ——A Combat Fragment of Cai Jintong, Second-Class Combat Hero of the Volunteer Army
    Yang Qi
    He—Scout Cai Jintong had already been wounded for the fourth time. An enemy “quick eight-grain” bullet exploded in his stomach, causing him to become dizzy and lose consciousness. Before this, he had sustained four other injuries while continuously repelling enemy counterattacks: a machine gun bullet grazed the top of his head from his left rear, cutting a deep groove through his hair and skin; two shrapnel fragments from a grenade shattered his right leg and left wrist; and another machine gun bullet pierced his left arm, breaking the bone.
    He didn't know how long it had been before he awoke from the intense pain. Opening his blood-caked eyes, he found himself still lying in the patch of weeds he had used for concealment and combat. His submachine gun, with only half a magazine of bullets left, had fallen four or five meters away from him on a small mound, and a mass of bloody, blurred intestines protruded from his left side.
    He used almost all of his strength. He pulled out his only available right hand from under his body and used it to prop himself up on the ground, propping himself up…. After sitting up, he crawled sideways to the front, first grabbing the gun in his hand. Then, he raised his head and looked around; it was very quiet, the sun had already set behind the mountains, and twilight was faintly rising from the depths of the valley.
    In an instant, he remembered the battle of the past half-day. At noon, the American devils had divided into so many routes to encircle our small and elite ambush team, and he—a scout who had temporarily accepted the task of covering the unit's withdrawal—had boldly seized this commanding height, which threatened the enemy's flank and rear, all alone in an extremely critical situation. He had used the crisp sound of his submachine gun to attract the enemy's attention. This was a fierce and skillful battle, deceiving the devils in the main attack direction into charging towards the hilltop he was guarding time and time again, as if attacking a position held by a large force. And Cai Jintong relied on his past rich combat experience, hiding and waiting… until the enemy was within a range that could not be closer, and then using sudden and intensive firepower to inflict fatal casualties on the enemy. As the battle reached the afternoon, the enemy's last charge was beaten back. Cai Jintong breathed a sigh of relief, but just as he had just gotten up and was about to shift targets, two enemies who had circled around to his flank and rear fired a cold shot at him from a small hill thirty or forty meters away.
    Regarding this point, this veteran, who believed that with him, no enemy could stand, felt a great sense of shame in his heart. At this moment, he sat on the ground, thinking bitterly:
    "You little bastards! You think you've killed me? I'm not dead yet! My right hand can still hold a gun and fight you!"
    A few minutes passed, and there was no movement all around. He began to tear off the triangular scarf tied on his head to bandage the wound on his stomach, where his intestines were protruding. To prevent the intestines from continuing to prolapse, he raised his broken left arm and tied it to his upper garment, using it to press against the wound. Taking advantage of the dimming light, he used the submachine gun to prop himself up and stood up.
    The surroundings became increasingly silent. The cold wind of the November evening blew up from the mountain valley, making Cai Jintong's mind much clearer. Now, he began to consider: The task of covering the retreat was completed, and almost all of the twenty or so enemies left behind had been annihilated by him. "I should return now!" he thought. He picked up his gun and followed the mountain valley down to the bottom of the gully.
    As he walked, he counted the enemy corpses lying scattered under the field ridges and next to the boulders, and he once again felt the joy after victory. But suddenly, from his left rear, a string of enemy automatic rifle bullets “patted” towards him again.
    Hastily, he immediately crawled forward and rolled into a shell crater half a person deep. He rested his head on a stone at the edge of the crater and opened his eyes to monitor the direction of the enemy's fire.
    A long period of silence. Apart from a few distant muffled explosions of hand grenades, there was no movement around. Cai Jintong suddenly felt a sense of fear, a fear of lacking bullets in battle. He thought: He now only had the last seven or eight bullets left in his gun. "What if a large number of enemies come to surround me?" If he had not been wounded, he would have smashed a few enemies with the butt of his gun when he ran out of bullets, and maybe he could have snatched one or two weapons from the enemy. But now, he could only lie here, and if the enemy rushed up to capture him, he could only punch them with his good right hand or bite them with his teeth. Be captured? He had never thought of this before! "At any rate, I will fight one or two of them to the death first! Like our platoon leader, Communist Party member Cai Qingrong, die with some backbone! Communist Party members die heroically, and I, this Youth League member who is often educated by the Party, cannot disgrace the Party!"
    Thinking of this, he began to calm down in his heart.
    At this moment, with a rustling sound of footsteps, the figures of two devils wearing steel helmets appeared twenty or thirty meters away. These two guys, one in front and one in the back, were hunching over and sneaking towards Cai Jintong’s direction. It was truly a case of enemies meeting, eyes blazing with hatred! Cai Jintong waited until the devil in front walked less than ten meters away from him, “Go to your mother’s!” He pulled the trigger, and with a “bang” the guy was knocked over; the devil behind him was like a frightened rabbit, turning around and running back the way he came. Cai Jintong hurriedly pulled the trigger again, but missed, thinking:
    "That's letting you off cheap, you little bastard! Go back and report to your officers!"
    After dark, he continued to crawl up and find his way back to our position. Although it was less than three li from our front line, for Cai Jintong, who had lost too much blood, this road was indeed long enough. At first, Cai Jintong barely managed to slowly walk with his trembling legs; later, he had to change his posture and crawl forward on the ground. This was a very arduous task. Every ditch, every earth ridge, which could have been stepped over in one stride in peacetime, was now like climbing a mountain; however, these "mountains" could not stop Cai Jintong, the strong scout! When he was exhausted, he used memories of the past to encourage himself to move forward. He would never forget that rainy night in August, when he and several Party members went behind enemy lines to scout the situation. On the way back, due to days and nights of climbing mountains and wading through water, his shoes were worn out, and sand and gravel, along with muddy water, poured into his shoes, creating several bloody holes on his feet. At that time, Cai Jintong was still just a member of the masses, and he kept asking for rest as he walked. Those Party members patiently comforted him and helped him walk back to his position. After arriving, everyone took off their shoes. When Cai Jintong looked, he saw that the feet of those Party members were simply unrecognisable, and the water in their shoes had all turned into blood. However, they had never uttered a word from beginning to end, and everyone was happily talking and laughing because they had completed the task…. Now, these exemplary actions of the Party members were resurrected in his mind, and he seemed to feel that those Party members were right by his side, and he seemed to hear the warm comfort of the Party members and the words encouraging him to move forward. He suddenly felt a new force filling his whole body, making him feel that he should stand up and walk back!… Soon after, the battered and bruised Cai Jintong was walking unsteadily on that desolate and rugged path; and he actually walked nearly half a li, and he even insisted on spending about half an hour crossing a cold, twenty-odd-meter-wide river. However, just as he stepped onto the opposite bank, a stone covered with ice and moss caused him to fall to the ground. A darkness came over him, and he lost consciousness.
    When Cai Jintong woke up, it was already the next morning. When the warm morning sun illuminated his eyelids, he realized that he was lying on a stretcher that was being carried by people. He turned his body and mumbled something in his throat, and immediately heard the voice of the Third Squad Leader shouting beside him: "He's alright! He's alive!" Then, several comrades-in-arms suddenly crowded over. They laughed and shouted, asking all sorts of questions; they told him how they had searched for him for most of the night without finding him, and then told him how they had found him on the ambulance stretcher of a friendly unit…. Cai Jintong couldn't say anything for a while, because he felt that there were too many things to say. He wanted to report his victory to his comrades, but he also felt that this victory was not his own; so whose victory was it? It was the Party's. Because yesterday, whether in a critical situation, or when encountering difficulties, as long as he thought of the Party, he had confidence in victory. He would feel that he had endless strength; of course, as long as he thought of the Party, he would also increase his courage to fight the enemy, he would even forget the possibility of death or dispel any negative or pessimistic thoughts, and he would also think of every way to defeat the enemy and overcome difficulties!

    党与胜利
    ——记志愿军二级战斗英雄蔡金同的一个战斗断片
    杨奇
    他——侦察员蔡金同已经是第四次负伤了。敌人的一颗“快八粒”子弹在他的肚子里爆炸了，使他昏昏沉沉地失掉了知觉。这以前，他在连续击退敌人的反扑中还负过四处伤：一颗机枪的子弹从他左后侧滑过头顶，连头发带皮肉地划了一条深沟；两块手榴弹的破片崩坏了他的右腿和左腕；另有一颗机枪子弹穿过他的左臂，把骨头打折了。
    不知道过了多久，他才从剧烈的疼痛中醒过来。睁开那双黏着血污的眼睛一看，发现自己仍然爬在那片用来隐蔽和进行战斗的荒草里，那支仅仅剩了半梭子弹的冲锋枪摔到离他前面四、五公尺的一个小土坡上，左胁下凸露出来一摊血肉模糊的肠子。
    他几乎把全身的力量都用出来了。抽出那只仅有的压在身子底下的右手，用它在地上撑着，撑着……。坐起来以后，他就侧着身子爬到前面，先把枪拿到手里，然后，他抬起头来看了看四周；四周很静，太阳已经压山了，暮色从山谷深处隐隐地升腾起来。
    一瞬间，他记起了这大半天来的战斗。中午，美国鬼子分那么多路来围击我们的一支短小精悍的伏击队，而他——一个临时接受了掩护部队转移任务的侦察员，在极度危急的情况下，就大胆地单身抢占了这个威胁敌人侧后的制高点，用清脆的冲锋枪声把敌人的注意力吸引过来。这是一场激烈而又技巧的战斗，迷惑了主攻方向的鬼子们一次又一次地向他扼守的这个山头冲锋，仿佛像进攻一个拥有大股兵力的阵地似的。而蔡金同靠着他过去的那些丰富的战斗经验，隐伏着，等待着……直到把敌人放到不能再近的范围以内，然后用突然的密集的火力给敌人以致命的杀伤。战斗到下午，敌人最后的一次冲锋被打下去了，蔡金同松了一口气，但就在他刚刚爬起来准备转移目标的时候，两个绕到他侧后的敌人，从一个离他三四十公尺的小山上打了他的冷枪。
    关于这一点，在这个有我无敌的老战士心里感到是个莫大的耻辱，此刻，他坐在地上恨恨地想着：
    “小子们！你满以为打死我了吧？我还没有死呢！我右手还可以拿枪跟你们干呢！”
    几分钟过去了，四下里毫无动静。他开始扯下扎在头上的那条三角巾，来动手包扎肠子都被打得突出来的肚皮上的伤口。为了防止肠子继续下坠，他又把那只打折了的左臂提起来绾在上衣上，用它来压着伤口。趁着微明的天色，他用冲锋枪撑着身子站起来了。
    四周越来越沉静了。十一月傍晚的寒风顺山洼吹上来，使蔡金同的头脑清醒了不少。现在，他开始考虑：掩护撤退的任务是完成了，留下来的二十多个敌人也差不多被他歼灭完了。“应该往回返啦！”他想着。就提起枪来，顺着山洼下到沟底。
    他一边走，一边清点着横七竖八地摆在田坎下面和乱石旁边的敌人的尸体，他又一次感到胜利后的快意。但是，突然间，在他的左后方，一串敌人的自动步枪子弹又朝他
    “拍拍”地打过来了。
    急忙地，他就势往前一爬，滚到一个半人深的炮弹坑里。把头枕在弹坑边的一块石头上，睁起眼睛来监视着敌人射击的方向。
    长时间的沉寂。除了远处几声隆然的手榴弹爆炸声外，周围没有任何一点动静。蔡金同忽然感到一阵恐惧，一种在战斗中缺乏子弹的恐惧。他想：他现在的枪里只剩下最后的七八发子弹了。“万一有大批的敌人来包围我，那怎么办？”假如他没有负伤，那他会在子弹打光了的时候拿枪托子砸倒几个敌人，说不定还可以从敌人手里捞它一两件武器。可是现在，他只能躺在这里，要是敌人冲上来俘掳他，他只能用那只完好的右手来捶它们或是用牙齿来咬它们。被俘吗？他过去从来也没有想到这一点！“好歹我要拚死它们一两个再说！像我们的排长、共产党员蔡庆荣同志一样。死要死的有点骨气！党员同志死得英雄，我这个经常受党教育的青年团员也不能给党丢脸！”
    想到这里，他心里开始镇定下来。
    也就在这个时候，随着一阵悉悉索索的脚步声，两个戴钢盔的鬼子的身影在他二三十公尺以外的地方出现了。这两个家伙一个在前，一个在后，哈着腰鬼鬼祟祟地朝着蔡金同这个方向走。真是仇人见面，分外眼红！蔡金同等前面的那个鬼子走到离他不上十公尺的地方，“去你妈的！”枪机一扳，“砰”地一声把那家伙打翻了；跟在后面的那个鬼子活像受了惊的兔子一样，扭转身子就往来路上回奔。蔡金同又赶着扣了一枪，没打中，心想：
    “便宜了你这小子！回去跟你的官长报信吧！”
    天黑下来以后，他又继续爬起来找路回我们的阵地了。这里离咱的前沿虽然不到三里，但对流血过多的蔡金同来说，这条路也的确够长了。开始，蔡金同还勉强支撑着用两条打颤的腿慢慢走着；赶到后来，他就不得不改变个姿势爬在地上往前移。这是一件非常艰苦的工作，每一条沟，每一个土坎，本来在平时是可以一步跨过去的地方，现在就等于爬一座山；可是，这些“山”是挡不住蔡金同这个坚强的侦察员的！当他筋疲力尽的时候，他就用回忆往事来鼓励自己前进。他永远忘不了八月间那个下着倾盆大雨的夜晚，那天，他随了几个党员同志到敌后去侦察情况。在往回走时，由于连夜的翻山涉水，鞋子磨烂了，砂石也随了泥水灌进鞋子里，把他的脚上磨了几个血窟窿。当时，蔡金同还是个群众，一边走，一边要求休息，那几个党员同志就耐心地安慰他，并扶着他走回自己的阵地。到家以后，大家都把鞋子脱下来。蔡金同一看，原来那几个党员同志的脚简直烂得不像话了，鞋子里的水也都变成了血水。可是，他们自始至终都没吭一声，每个人都因为完成任务而高兴地谈笑着……。现在，这些党员的模范行为又在他的脑子里复活了，他仿佛感到那几个党员同志就在他的身边，他仿佛又听到了党员同志们的那些热情的安慰和鼓励他前进的话，他猛然间感到了有一股新的力量充满了全身，使他觉得自己应该站起来走回去！……不久以后，遍体鳞伤的蔡金同就在那条荒凉而崎岖的小道上摇摇摆摆地走着了；而且他居然走了将近半里多路，他甚至会坚持着用了半个钟头左右的时间来渡过了一条二十来公尺宽的冰冷的小河。可是，正当他踏上对面河岸的时候，一块蒙着冰凌和青苔的石头使他一跤摔在地上，眼前一阵昏黑，他失去了知觉。
    蔡金同醒来的时候已经是第二天清晨，当温暖的朝阳照亮他的眼睑，他才发觉自己已经躺在一付正在由人抬着走动的担架上面。他转动了一下身子，喉咙里不知迷迷糊糊地喊了一声什么，马上就听见三班副的声音在他的身旁喊着：“好了！他活过来了！”接着，好几个战友的面孔就一下子凑了过来。他们又笑又叫，问长道短；他们告诉他怎样找了他大半夜没有找到，然后又告诉他怎样才在友邻部队的救护担架上发现了他……。蔡金同一时间什么话都说不上来了，因为他觉得要讲的话太多了。他想向战友们汇报一下他的胜利情况，但他又仿佛觉得这个胜利不是他自己的；那么胜利是谁的呢？是党。因为在昨天，不论是在情况危急的时候，不论是在碰到艰苦困难的时候，只要一想到党，他就对胜利有了信心。他就会感到自己有了无穷无尽的力量；当然，只要一想到党，他也就会增长了对敌人斗争的勇气，他甚至会忘掉了死的可能或是打消一切任何消极悲观的念头，他也会想出一切办法来战胜敌人，克服困难！（附图片）
