Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: According to TASS, Berlin, 15th, the High Commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany wrote a letter to the Soviet High Commissioner to Germany, Ambassador V.S. Semyonov, on June 27 regarding the issue of restoring normal life in Berlin.

On July 15, Berlin newspapers published the reply letter from Ambassador V.S. Semyonov to the U.S. High Commissioner to Germany, Conant, in which he pointed out: The occupation authorities of the three Western countries have so far not taken measures to dissolve the sinister organizations hiding within West Berlin that specialize in conducting sabotage activities against the German Democratic Republic, namely, the "Combat Group Against Inhumanity," the fascist "German Youth League," the Eastern Bureau of the Social Democratic Party, and the Eastern Department of the Christian Democratic Union, etc.

Semyonov's letter stated: Facts have proven that the arson, looting, and other disturbances that occurred in East Berlin on June 17 were indeed committed by provocateurs and criminals belonging to the aforementioned organizations.

Semyonov pointed out in the letter that the government of the German Democratic Republic has already issued an order to lift restrictions on crossing the demarcation line. He requested the Western occupation authorities to take effective measures to dissolve the aforementioned sinister organizations and to prohibit sending provocateurs and fascist spies from West Berlin to East Berlin.

Similar letters were also sent to British High Commissioner Kirkpatrick and French High Commissioner François-Poncet.

    苏联驻德高级专员致函西方三国高级专员要求解散西柏林法西斯特务组织
    【新华社十六日讯】    据塔斯社柏林十五日讯：美、英、法三国驻德高级专员于六月二十七日就恢复柏林正常生活的问题写信给苏联驻德高级专员维·斯·谢麦诺夫大使。
    七月十五日，柏林报纸公布了维·斯·谢麦诺夫大使给美国驻德高级专员康南特的复信，其中指出：三个西方国家的占领当局迄今尚未采取措施，解散藏身在西柏林境内的专事对德意志民主共和国进行破坏活动的罪恶组织——反对非人道主义斗争团、法西斯主义的“德国青年联盟”、社会民主党东方局、基督教民主联盟东方部等。
    谢麦诺夫的信说：事实已经证明，六月十七日柏林东部发生的纵火、抢劫和其他骚乱，是确实属于上述组织的挑拨者和犯罪者所干的事情。
    谢麦诺夫在信中指出德意志民主共和国政府已经下令取消对于通过分界线的限制，他要求西方占领当局采取有效措施，解散上述罪恶组织，并禁止把挑拨者和法西斯特务从西柏林派到东柏林来。
    同样的信也送给了英国高级专员柯克帕特里克和法国高级专员弗朗索瓦·庞赛。
