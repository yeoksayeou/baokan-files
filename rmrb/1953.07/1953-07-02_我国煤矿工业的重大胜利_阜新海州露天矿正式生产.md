    A Major Victory for China's Coal Mining Industry
    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Officially Starts Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 1st – The official handover and production commencement ceremony for the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine was held on the northern slope of the open-pit mine on the morning of July 1st. This modern open-pit mine, built over two years, has now officially entered production.
    Among those attending the ceremony were Xu Daben, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry; Li Huaji, Deputy Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau; Li Huang, Second Deputy Secretary of the CCP Liaoxi Provincial Committee; representatives from the National Committee and Northeast China Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union; representatives from fraternal factories and mines; Soviet experts; and over 12,000 people including responsible persons from Fuxin city organs, troops, workers, farmers, women, and students.
    After Zhang Xuewen, Director of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, delivered the opening address, Li Huaji, Chairman of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Acceptance Committee, presented the acceptance report to the assembly. The acceptance proved that the mine met the conditions for handover and production, and was completed half a year ahead of the original preliminary design. Subsequently, Xu Daben, Vice Minister of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, spoke, saying: With Soviet assistance, the active labor of all employees, and the support of the people of the whole country, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has overcome many difficulties and has victoriously completed the initial stage of construction and officially entered production. This is a major victory for China's coal mining industry. Li Huang said in his speech: The official handover of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine on the glorious festival of the 32nd anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party is a valuable gift to the Party's birthday. Soviet experts who helped build the open-pit mine, such as Comrade Goribkov, also spoke at the meeting. They all congratulated New China on embarking on a new victory in socialist construction.
    The assembly presented flags and flowers to the Soviet friends, and flowers to the labor models who built the open-pit mine. After Xu Daben cut the ribbon, Huang Yuzhong, Director of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, ordered the official start of production. Soviet-style electric shovels and automatic electric vehicles, decorated with colorful silks and flags, began to rotate and dig coal.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 1st – China's first newly built giant open-pit mine, the Fuxin Haizhou Mine, officially entered production today, offering a grand gift to the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party.
    After the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the handover to production, the Soviet-style electric shovels extended their long mouths to deposit chunks of shiny black coal into the carriages, which were then pulled by electric locomotives along a circular railway to the coal tipping bridge to unload the coal. The coal then adhered to conveyor belts and entered the coal storage bins, and after several mechanical processes, it was divided into fuel coal and oil refining raw materials. This is a powerful new force added to China's fuel industry. From now on, the Fuxin Haizhou Mine will supply large amounts of coal to industrial cities such as Anshan, Shenyang, Fushun, and Dalian, as well as railway systems such as Harbin, Jinzhou, and Andong, as industrial fuel for steelmaking, power generation, machinery, and transportation. It plays a significant role in China's industrial construction.
    The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine is 3.6 kilometers long from east to west and 1.5 kilometers wide from north to south. It is a mine with abundant reserves and excellent coal quality. If fully developed, the amount of earth and stone excavated would reach 563.3 million cubic meters, enough to build an earthen embankment one meter high and one meter wide that could circle the Earth fourteen times. If excavated by manpower, it would take 1,000 people digging every day for 514 years just to excavate the soil. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, predatory coal mining was carried out. After years of operation, besides six inclined shafts and an "open-pit mine" that was only one or two hundred meters long and wide and never saw coal, the rest was just barren yellow earth. In May 1951, with Soviet assistance, China officially began development using new machinery for earth removal, transportation, and other tasks. During the construction, management personnel and engineering personnel worked hard day and night, and the workers labored selflessly and created actively, resulting in many heroic deeds, as well as new records such as the Zhu Wei electric shovel team digging 7,842 cubic meters of earth and stone per day and the Song Yongkuan vehicle team operating safely for 71,000 kilometers. Mechanical efficiency was about doubled compared to Japan, Britain, and the United States. In just over two years, the complex projects of excavation, earth and stone works, railways, culverts, and wiring for the handover of production have been completed according to plan, and all preparations for production have been made, so that it can be smoothly transferred to production. In the future, construction will continue simultaneously with production to bring the mine facilities and coal production to the highest design requirements.
    Now, in the gourd-shaped mine, the coal and soil sections are cut very neatly, the railways meander and crisscross, and the power lines are densely distributed. In the field, in addition to a few workers operating machinery, the electric shovels digging soil and the operation of the electric locomotives form a harmonious rhythm, and the production process has been mechanized. From next year, track shifting, electricity metering, and signaling will also be fully mechanized and automated. The dispatch room will be the command center for open-pit operations, and dispatchers will sit in front of observation instruments to monitor the location of machinery. At the same time, they can use ultra-shortwave devices to talk to locomotive drivers and operate the buttons to switch tracks and control signal lights. As long as the locomotive sees a green light, it can proceed along the already switched track. In the event of an accident, the entire line can be stopped by pressing an electric bell, which ensures both smooth vehicle operation and safe operation. If the coal mining site is too far from the railway, the track can be moved section by section to a new location using a track-rocking machine and a crane, and continue to operate after it has been laid. In addition, the mine also has ultra-shortwave devices and automatic telephone equipment. The mine director can talk directly to production workers to understand the situation and direct the work. As a result of mechanization and automation, although the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine has only one-fifth of the employees of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine, it can produce more coal, and the cost of coal mining is extremely low.

    我国煤矿工业的重大胜利
    阜新海州露天矿正式生产
    【新华社阜新一日电】阜新海州露天煤矿正式移交生产大会于七月一日上午在露天矿北坡举行，经过二年多建设的现代化的露天矿从此正式转入生产。
    参加大会的有中央人民政府燃料工业部副部长徐达本，煤矿管理总局副局长李华楫，中共辽西省委员会第二副书记李荒，中国煤矿工会全国委员会和东北区委员会代表，各兄弟厂矿代表，苏联专家和阜新市机关负责人、部队、工人、农民、妇女、学生等一万二千多人。
    大会在阜新矿务局局长张学文致开会词后，海州露天矿验收委员会主任委员李华楫接着向大会作移交生产的验收报告。经过验收证明：该矿已具备了移交生产的条件，并比原来的初步设计提前半年完成。接着，中央燃料工业部副部长徐达本讲话，他说：海州露天矿在苏联帮助、在全体职工积极劳动和全国人民支援下，克服了重重困难，已胜利地完成了建设的初步阶段，正式转入生产。这是我国煤矿工业的重大胜利。李荒在讲话中称：在中国共产党诞生三十二周年的光荣节日里，海州露天矿正式移交生产，这是献给党的生日的可贵礼物。亲手帮助建设露天矿的苏联专家哥里布可夫等也在会上讲了话。他们一致祝贺新中国走上社会主义建设的新的胜利。
    大会向苏联友人献旗、献花，向建设露天矿的劳动模范献花。在徐达本剪彩后，海州露天矿矿长黄育中下令正式开始生产，排列在四周的扎满彩绸彩旗的苏联式电铲、自动电车，开始转动挖煤。
    【新华社阜新一日电】新中国新建第一座巨型露天矿——阜新海州矿今日正式进入生产，为中国共产党生日作了隆重献礼。
    当移交生产典礼剪彩后，苏联式电铲伸出长嘴将啃下的黑亮煤块吐进车厢，由电机车牵引沿着环状铁道将煤拉到翻煤桥向下倾倒，煤即附着皮带进入贮煤仓，再经几道机械加工被分成燃料用煤和炼油原料。这是中国燃料工业上新增加的一支强大力量。从此阜新海州矿将以大量煤源源供应鞍山、沈阳、抚顺、大连等工业城市以及哈尔滨、锦州、安东等铁路系统作炼钢、发电、机械、运输等工业燃料。对我国工业建设起着很大作用。
    海州露天矿东西长三点六公里，南北宽一点五公里，是埋藏量丰富、煤质优良的矿场。若全面开发，土石方即达到五亿六千三百三十万立方公尺，铺成高宽各一公尺厚的土堤可绕地球十四周。若用人力挖掘每天一千人光挖土即需五百一十四年。日伪统治时期曾进行掠夺式采煤，经营多年除了六个斜井和一个长宽不过一、二百公尺从来未见煤的“露天矿”外，其余尽是黄土荒原。一九五一年五月我国在苏联帮助下采用除土、运输等新式机械正式开发，建设中管理人员、工程人员日夜辛劳，工人们忘我的劳动和积极创造，出现了许多英雄业迹，以及朱伟电铲小组日挖土石方七八四二立方公尺、宋永宽包车组安全运转七万一千公里等新纪录。机械效率较日、英、美约提高一倍。仅两年多为移交生产而建设的庞杂的采掘土石方、铁道、涵洞、架线等工程都已按计划完成，并做好生产的一切准备工作，因而能顺利地转入生产。今后与生产同时将继续进行建设，使矿场设施和煤产量达到设计的最高要求。
    现在葫芦形的矿场里，煤土段层切削得十分整齐，铁道蜿蜒交错，电线密布，场内除少数工人操纵机械外，电铲削土和电机车运转形成合拍节奏的音调，生产过程已机械化了。明年起搬道、电计、信号亦将全部机械化自动化，调度室将是露天作业的指挥部，调度员坐在观测仪表前掌握机械位置，同时可用超短波装置和机车司机通话并掌握电钮拨道岔和控制信号灯，机车只要见绿灯即可沿已拨好的铁道前进。如发生事故，一按电铃即可全线停车，既使车辆运转流畅又保证安全作业。如采煤场子离铁道过远时，只要使用摇道机和起重机，就可使轨道逐节移动到新地段上铺设好继续作业。此外矿场内还有超短波装置，自动电话设备，矿长可直接和生产工人谈话了解情况，指挥工作。机械化自动化的结果，阜新露天煤矿的职工虽然只有抚顺露天矿职工的五分之一，却能生产更多的煤，采煤成本又极为低廉。
