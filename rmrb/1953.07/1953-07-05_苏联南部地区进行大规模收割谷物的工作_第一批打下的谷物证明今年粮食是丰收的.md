    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th — Large-scale grain harvesting is underway in the southern regions of the Soviet Union. In the Central Asian republics, in Moldova and the southern regions of the Ukrainian Republic, and in the North and South Caucasus and Crimea, hundreds and thousands of machine operators are driving various harvesting machines across the vast, golden fields. They have launched a socialist competition, guaranteeing the rapid and damage-free harvesting of grain. To date, these regions have harvested hundreds of thousands of hectares of grain (each hectare equals 15 Chinese mu). The Soviet "Agriculture Newspaper" said that the first batches of harvested grain from various regions prove that this year's grain harvest is a bumper one.
    This year, the level of mechanization in Soviet harvesting work is very high. In southern Ukraine, 90 to 95 percent of the grain is harvested using combine harvesters. Some collective farms have completely mechanized their grain harvesting with combine harvesters. The number of mechanized threshing grounds will increase by one to two times compared to last year; among them, electric threshing grounds will increase by 50 percent. Grain threshing machines will increase to 80 percent; the level of mechanization for cutting stubble and stacking straw will reach over 70 percent. In the Chu River valley, the "granary" of the Kyrgyz Republic, collective farms will use combine harvesters to harvest 98 percent of the grain. In regions such as Kuban, Stavropol Krai, and the Don River basin, the level of mechanization in grain harvesting is very high. Hundreds of harvesting machines are actively working in the large winter wheat fields of Kuban. Grain is flowing continuously to the threshing grounds. Each field work team has established mechanized threshing grounds that can save six-sevenths of the labor force. At the threshing ground of the third field work team of the Stalin Collective Farm in Kushchevsky District, a grain cleaning machine cleans 100 tons of grain per day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th — Soviet agricultural workers have begun the busy season of harvesting winter wheat. In the southern regions of the Uzbek Republic, wheat and barley are being harvested. Many combine operators in Kashkadarya Oblast are harvesting 18 to 20 hectares (each hectare equals 15 mu) of grain per day. Some collective farms are harvesting 2,500 to 2,600 kilograms of grain per hectare, and many collective farms are harvesting over 2,000 kilograms per hectare. The Kyrgyz Republic is harvesting barley. Harvesting work in Jambyl Oblast of the Kazakh Republic is in full swing. Combine operators have launched a socialist competition to harvest grain in a timely and lossless manner. Combine operator Liventsov, driving a "Stalin-6" combine harvester, harvested grain on 26 hectares of land in one day on the 25th. Astrakhan Oblast is harvesting rye and barley. Many districts in Dagestan of the Russian Federation are also harvesting wheat. Combine operators in the Buynaksk District have pledged that one machine will harvest 850 hectares of grain in 25 days. Grozny Oblast is harvesting barley. Harvesting has begun on the vast steppes of southeastern Stavropol Krai. Hundreds of harvesting machines are working intensely in the fields. Combine operators have launched a competition to increase machine utilization, shorten harvesting periods, and avoid losses. They are harvesting an average of 23 hectares of grain per day. Combine operator Golubev harvested 114 hectares of wheat in one day using two "Stalin-6" combine harvesters, and Zaika harvested 57 hectares of grain with one combine harvester. Krasnodar Krai has begun harvesting barley. The "Northern" Machine Tractor Station harvested 911 hectares of grain with 33 machines in four days. Kherson Oblast of the Ukrainian Republic has also begun harvesting. Some collective farms are threshing 2,300 to 2,500 kilograms of grain per hectare.
    Now, harvesting work is continuing to expand from the southern regions to other regions, and other areas are making intensive preparations to welcome the harvest. Collective farms that have already harvested grain are turning in high-quality grain to the state.

    苏联南部地区进行大规模收割谷物的工作
    第一批打下的谷物证明今年粮食是丰收的
    【新华社莫斯科四日电】苏联南部地区正在进行大规模收割谷物的工作。在中亚细亚各共和国，在摩尔达维亚和乌克兰共和国南部，在南、北高加索和克里米亚，成千成百的机器操使者，正在驾驶各种收割机器，奔驰在金黄色的、辽阔的田野上。他们展开了社会主义竞赛，保证要迅速无损地收割谷物。到目前为止，这些地区已收割了几十万公顷的谷物（每公顷合十五市亩）。苏联“农业报”说：各地第一批打下的谷物证明，今年粮食是丰收的。
    今年苏联收割工作的机械化水平很高。在乌克兰南部，百分之九十到九十五的谷物，都用收割联合机收割。有些集体农庄已全部用收割联合机收割谷物。机械化的打谷场的数目要比去年增加一、两倍；其中，电力打谷场将增加百分之五十。碎谷机器将增加到百分之八十；刈残根和堆麦秆的工作，机械化水平将达百分之七十以上。在吉尔吉斯共和国的“谷仓”——楚河流域，各集体农庄要用收割联合机收割百分之九十八的谷物。在库班、斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区和顿河流域等地，收割谷物的机械化水平非常高。库班的大片冬小麦田里，有几百台收割机活跃着。谷物川流不息地送到打谷场上。每一个田间工作队都建立了可以节省七分之六人力的机械化打谷场。在库晓夫区斯大林集体农庄的第三田间工作队的打谷场上，清谷机每天清谷一百吨。
    【新华社莫斯科六月三十日电】苏联农业劳动者开始了收割冬麦的农忙季节。乌兹别克共和国南部地区收割着小麦和大麦，卡什卡达林斯卡州的许多收割机手，每天收割十八到二十公顷（每公顷合十五亩）的谷物。有的集体农庄每公顷收获两千五、六百公斤谷物，很多集体农庄每公顷收获两千公斤以上。吉尔吉斯共和国正在收割大麦。哈萨克共和国江布尔州的收割工作正在紧张进行中。收割机手展开了及时和无损失地收割谷物的社会主义竞赛。收割机手李文佐夫驾驶“斯大林六”式收割联合机，在二十五日一天中收割了二十六公顷土地的谷物。阿斯特拉罕州正在收割着黑麦和大麦。俄罗斯联邦达吉斯坦的许多区也在收着麦子，布因拉克区的收割机手保证一台机器在二十五天内收割八百五十公顷谷物。格罗兹尼州收割着大麦。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区东南部的广大草原上已开始收割了。几百台收割机器在田间紧张地工作着。收割机手展开了提高机器利用率、缩短收割期限和避免损失的竞赛。他们每天平均收割二十三公顷土地的谷物。收割机手戈卢夫用两台“斯大林六”式收割联合机，一天收割了一百一十四公顷小麦，扎伊卡用一台收割了五十七公顷谷物。克拉斯诺达边疆区开始收割大麦。“北方”机器拖拉机站在四天中用三十三台机器收割了九百一十一公顷谷物。乌克兰共和国刻松州也开始收割了。有的集体农庄每公顷打谷二千三、五百公斤。
    现在，收割工作正从南部地区向其他地区继续扩展，其他各地已紧张地进行着迎接收割的准备工作。已经收割了谷物的集体农庄正在把上等谷物缴纳给国家。
