After achieving significant success in the patriotic health campaign in 1952, Nanjing launched the spring health campaign and focused on promoting hygiene in the food and beverage industry this year. It also comprehensively launched the summer health campaign, bringing the city's patriotic health work to a new stage. Starting this summer, the Nanjing Patriotic Health Committee also systematically trained health workers from factories, residential areas, various industries, government offices, and schools. They also used various forms of propaganda to widely educate the masses and improve their knowledge of health science. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, Nanjing successfully concluded the summer health campaign and is now systematically transitioning to regularized work to consolidate and develop the achievements made.

The children of the Wu Laocun Kindergarten are competing to see whose hands are the cleanest. This kindergarten was established during the patriotic health campaign. The children not only gain a lot of health knowledge here, but also motivate their parents to do a good job in hygiene.

Changping Road Primary School in the Sixth District of Nanjing is now a model school for hygiene. In addition to actively doing a good job in school hygiene, the students also organize propaganda teams to frequently publicize the importance of patriotic health work to nearby residents.

The street in Wu Laocun used to be a garbage ditch, but now it has been repaired into a flat pebble road. The residents also frequently sweep and maintain cleanliness. (Photo by Zhang Wenqin of this newspaper)

The residents of the Si Suo Village in the Sixth District organized mosquito and fly catching teams, often going around to catch mosquitoes in the evening.

The health inspection team, composed of the head of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government and health work model Auntie Lu, inspects the cleanliness and hygiene of the Nanjing Textile Factory's kitchen.

The health inspection team composed of citizens carefully inspects the patriotic health work of the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee.

The "Guangou" in the Third District is a stinking ditch as long as one thousand meters, which is a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies. Now, under the leadership of Lu Dama, a national health model, more than a thousand people have participated in the renovation work.

The elderly in the Nanjing Old and Disabled Nursing Home also actively participated in the patriotic health work, making the inside and outside of the courtyard clean and tidy, and won the honorary title of National Health Model.

In the city's key promotion of hygiene in the food and beverage industry, employees in various food and beverage industries have shown a high degree of enthusiasm. This is the scene of the workers of the Guanshengyuan Food Store carefully scrubbing the pastry models boiled in alkaline water.

The Qinhuai River is a stagnant river that endangers people's health. The Nanjing Municipal People's Government decided to thoroughly dredge this river so that it can be connected to the Yangtze River and Xuanwu Lake. This is the scene of the surveyors of the Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau carrying out survey work.

    南京市的爱国卫生运动在一九五二年取得重大成绩后，今年又进行了春季卫生运动和重点推动饮食卫生行业的卫生工作，并全面地展开了夏季卫生工作，使全市的爱国卫生工作进入了一个新的阶段。南京市爱国卫生委员会从今年夏季起，还有计划地进行了工厂、居民、各个行业、机关和学校等卫生骨干的训练工作，并运用各种宣传形式广泛教育群众，提高了群众的卫生科学知识。在党和政府的正确领导下，南京市胜利地结束了夏季卫生运动后，现正有计划地转入经常化工作，巩固和发展已取得的成绩。
