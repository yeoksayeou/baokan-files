Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the people of various provinces in Vietnam are enthusiastically launching a patriotic health campaign in response to the government's call.

The broad masses of farmers and students in Phu Tho, Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, Hoa Binh and other provinces have universally and on a large scale carried out work to eliminate garbage, eliminate flies, mosquitoes, and rats, dig new wells, and establish toilets, and have achieved good results. In Phu Tho province alone, 3,500 households were rated as model health households in the health campaign.

The people of Hoa Binh province first combined the patriotic health campaign with the work of increasing production and protecting crops. While killing rats, flies, and mosquitoes, they also went to the fields to kill insects. As a result, one township saved thirteen hectares of cornfields from insect pests.

    越南人民开展爱国卫生运动
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南各省人民响应政府的号召，正在热烈展开爱国卫生运动。
    富寿、南定、宁平、和平等省的广大农民和学生普遍大规模地进行扫除垃圾、扑灭苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、挖掘新井、设立厕所的工作，取得了良好成绩。仅在富寿省一个省，就有三千五百户人家在卫生运动中被评为卫生模范户。
    和平省人民首先把爱国卫生运动和增加生产、保护庄稼的工作结合起来。他们在捕杀老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子同时，还到田地里捕杀昆虫。有一个乡因此使十三公顷的玉米田免遭虫害。
