    Syngman Rhee Clamors for "Unilateral Policies"
    People Vigilantly Watch How the United States Will Fulfill Its Guarantees
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 24th] Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: In the past four days, Dulles and Syngman Rhee have been singing in chorus, displaying their performance vividly. On the 21st, Dulles said that if South Korea is "re-attacked," "the United States will retaliate against such action"; a day later, on the 22nd, Syngman Rhee said that he was not bound by the armistice agreement; later on the same day, Dulles added that Syngman Rhee "has the right" to retain his claim; then, a day later, on the 24th, Syngman Rhee hinted that he would "adopt unilateral policies."

    Syngman Rhee's statement issued today began like this: "We welcome and admire the sincere and friendly wording in Secretary of State Dulles' statement. I am particularly pleased because this statement gives me the opportunity to publicly explain my own views." What are Syngman Rhee's "views"? This is that he believes that the "concessions and promises made by the United States to him are being undermined by the agreement reached at Panmunjom." Therefore, he threatens to "adopt unilateral policies."

    Syngman Rhee listed the promises made by the United States during his meeting with Robertson. These promises are:

    (1) Sign a mutual security treaty.

    (2) Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated "will be released in South Korea." Chinese prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated "will be sent to the destination of their choice."

    (3) "The United States will, together with South Korea, set a time limit for the political conference." "If the political conference is fruitless," Syngman Rhee will be "completely free" to resume the war.

    (4) "Released Korean prisoners must not be arrested or re-detained," that is, not to recover the more than 27,000 prisoners of war who have been taken away by the Syngman Rhee gang.

    Syngman Rhee accused the United States of violating the promises Robertson made to him in the guarantees it made to the Korean and Chinese sides at Panmunjom. He clamored that he "will never allow" the prisoners of war to be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or sent to neutral countries. He opposed Harriman's guarantee that "the armistice has no time limit" and demanded that the United States refuse to discuss the issue of recovering the more than 27,000 prisoners of war who were forcibly detained at the political conference.

    Syngman Rhee said that he also demanded that the United States provide a guarantee as the "main basis" for his "reluctant postponement" of his plan to unify Korea by force. This requirement is: The United States guarantees him that if the political conference fails, the United States will rejoin the war with him, and if this cannot be done, the United States will provide "spiritual and material" support in addition to economic assistance. Syngman Rhee wants his "good friend" Robertson to "do his best" in Washington to realize this requirement for him.

    Syngman Rhee threatened that if the United States does not agree to all these demands, he will adopt the so-called "unilateral policies," that is to say, he will undermine the armistice.

    Syngman Rhee was originally a lackey of the United States, brought from the United States to Korea by the Americans and raised by them. Without the support of American guns and dollars, he would not be able to survive in South Korea for a single day. Syngman Rhee is increasingly clamoring against the armistice because he sees that Dulles has been encouraging him, he believes that his Washington masters will not abandon him, and it is said that Robertson also gave him a check for 1.6 billion US dollars while in Seoul. According to the July 15th "New York Post," Robertson promised: "The United States will establish a South Korean army of twenty-two divisions, and a sizable navy and air force. It costs 100 million US dollars to train and equip one division of the Korean army. The Korean army currently has sixteen divisions, which means that in addition to establishing some naval and air force units, six more army divisions must be established. The cost of such a military plan is estimated to be over 600 million US dollars. In the coming years, the United States will provide a large amount of economic and construction assistance, estimated to be worth about 1 billion US dollars."

    Now, Syngman Rhee is asking the United States to cash in. The Prime Minister of Syngman Rhee's government, Paik Too-chin, publicly stated on the 23rd that if the United States does not give money immediately, South Korea will be finished.

    Syngman Rhee is increasingly blatantly opposing the armistice precisely because he knows that the armistice is getting closer every day. Syngman Rhee once said that the armistice agreement was his "death sentence," and now he is making his final struggle. The Foreign Minister of the Syngman Rhee government, Pyun Yung-tai, openly demanded today that South Korea be notified three days before the signing of the armistice agreement, threatening that the Syngman Rhee group would take new destructive actions before the armistice is realized.

    Now, people are vigilantly watching what steps the US government will take to prevent Syngman Rhee's sabotage and to fulfill the guarantees made by the US representatives at the Panmunjom negotiation conference at this moment when the preparations for signing the armistice agreement are nearing completion.

### 李承晚叫嚣要采取“片面政策”  人们警惕地注视着美国如何履行它的保证

    李承晚叫嚣要采取“片面政策”
    人们警惕地注视着美国如何履行它的保证
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在过去四天中，杜勒斯和李承晚的一唱一和，可以说是表现得淋漓尽致了。二十一日，杜勒斯说，如果南朝鲜“重新受到侵略”，“美国将对这种行动予以还击”；过了一天，二十二日，李承晚就说，他不受停战协定的约束；同是这一天的较晚时间，杜勒斯又说，李承晚“有权利”保留他的主张；于是，隔了一天，二十四日，李承晚就来暗示他要“采取片面政策”了。
    李承晚今天发表的声明是这样开始的：“我们欢迎并且感佩国务卿杜勒斯声明中的诚挚友好的措词。我所以感到高兴特别是由于这个声明使我有机会公开解释我自己的见解。”李承晚的“见解”是什么呢？这就是他认为美国对他“所做的让步与诺言正受到板门店所达成的协议的破坏”。因此他威胁着要“采取片面政策”。
    李承晚列举了在他和罗伯逊会谈时美国方面所作的诺言。这些诺言就是：
    （一）签订共同安全条约。
    （二）不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘“将在南朝鲜予以释放”。不直接遣返的中国籍战俘“将被送到他们自己选择的目的地去”。
    （三）“美国将和韩国一起给政治会议规定一个时限”。“如果政治会议没有结果”，李承晚就能“完全自由地”恢复战争。
    （四）“不得逮捕或重新拘禁被释放的朝鲜俘虏”，就是说不追回已被李承晚匪帮押走的二万七千多名战俘。
    李承晚指责美国在板门店向朝中方面提出的保证违反了罗伯逊向他提出的诺言。他叫嚣说，他“绝不允许”将战俘交给中立国遣返委员会或把他们送到中立国去。他反对哈利逊所作的“停战没有时间限制”的保证，并且要求美国拒绝在政治会议上讨论追回被强迫扣留的二万七千多名战俘的问题。
    李承晚说，他还要求美国提出一个保证，作为他“勉强推迟”他的武力统一朝鲜计划的“主要基础”。这个要求是：美国向他保证：如果政治会议失败，美国就和他一起重新作战，如果这一点作不到，美国除了给予经济援助以外，还要“在精神上和物质上”予以支持。李承晚要他的“好朋友”罗伯逊在华盛顿替他为实现这个要求“尽力而为”。
    李承晚威胁说，如果美国不答应他所有这些要求，他就要采取所谓“片面政策”，也就是说，他要破坏停战。
    李承晚原本是美国的走狗，是美国人一手把他从美国牵到朝鲜来，并一手豢养起来的。没有美国的枪杆和金元的支持，他在南朝鲜一天也维持不了。李承晚日甚一日地叫嚣反对停战，是因为他看到了杜勒斯一直在鼓励他，他相信他的华盛顿的主人不会丢掉他，而且据说罗伯逊在汉城时还给他开了一张达十六亿美元的支票。据七月十五日的“纽约邮报”说，罗伯逊曾答应：“美国将建立包括二十二个师的南朝鲜陆军，和一支相当大的海军和空军。训练和装备韩军一个师就需要一亿美元。韩国陆军现有十六个师，这就是说，除去还要建立一些海空军部队以外，还要建立六个陆军师。这样一项军事计划所需要的费用，估计就达六亿美元以上。在今后几年中，美国将提供大量的经济和建设援助，估计约值十亿美元。”    现在，李承晚要求美国兑现。李承晚政府的总理白斗镇二十三日就公开说：如果美国不立刻给钱，南朝鲜就完蛋了。
    李承晚越来越嚣张地反对停战，正因为他知道停战一天比一天接近了。李承晚曾经说过停战协定是他的“死刑判决书”，现在他要作最后的挣扎了。李承晚政府的外务部长官卞荣泰今天就露骨地要求在签订停战协定前三天通知南朝鲜，要挟着李承晚集团要在停战实现之前采取新的破坏行动。
    现在，人们警惕地注视着，在这签订停战协定的准备工作接近完成的时刻，美国政府将采取什么步骤来防止李承晚的破坏行动，来履行美方代表在板门店谈判会议中所作的保证。
