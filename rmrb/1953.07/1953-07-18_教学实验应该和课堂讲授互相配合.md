Readers' Letters Abstract:

    Teaching Experiments Should Coordinate with Classroom Lectures
    Northwest University teaching assistants Liu Yilun and Lei Mingde wrote: In the chemistry department's professional teaching plan at our university, the first year has a course in general physics. According to the teaching plan: the content of this course in the first semester is mechanics in classroom lectures, while the teaching experiments are in electromagnetism and heat; and in the second semester, the classroom lectures are electromagnetism and heat, but the experiments are in mechanics. The result of this is that theory and practice cannot be unified, and students have difficulties understanding the teaching content and conducting experiments, thus affecting their learning enthusiasm. Teaching assistants also have difficulty guiding the experiments. Students and some teachers have raised many opinions to the Academic Affairs Office regarding this situation, but because the responsible comrades of the Academic Affairs Office and some teachers believe that "physics experiments have independence and do not need to coordinate with lectures" and use objective difficulties as an excuse, the problem has not been resolved until now.
    We believe that experiments themselves are an important method to deepen understanding of classroom lectures and consolidate memory, and also have the effect of checking teaching and improving teaching. Emphasizing that experiments do not need to coordinate with lectures is a wrong view.

### 教学实验应该和课堂讲授互相配合

    教学实验应该和课堂讲授互相配合
    西北大学助教刘翊纶、雷明德来信：我校化学系的专业教学计划中，一年级有普通物理学一课。根据教学计划规定：这一门课在上学期课堂讲授内容为力学，而教学实验则是电磁学、热学；而下学期课堂讲授为电磁学、热学，实验却为力学。这样做的结果，使理论和实践不能统一，同学们理解教学内容和进行实验都有困难，因而影响学习情绪。助教辅导实验也很困难。对于这种情况同学们和某些教师都向教务处提过很多意见，但是因为教务处负责同志和有的教师认为“物理实验有独立性，不必与讲课配合”和藉口客观困难，因此问题到现在还不能解决。
    我们认为实验本身是加深对课堂讲授的理解和巩固记忆的重要方法，同时并有检查教学和改进教学的作用。强调实验不必配合讲课这种看法是错误的。
