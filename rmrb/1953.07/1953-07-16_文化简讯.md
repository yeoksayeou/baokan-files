	Memorial Concert for the 18th Anniversary of Nie Er's Death to be Held by the All-China Music Workers Association and Other Organizations
	This year, July 17th marks the 18th anniversary of the death of the people's musician Nie Er. To commemorate this great realist composer and pioneer of the Chinese revolutionary music movement, the All-China Music Workers Association and the Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Bureau will hold a concert at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall in the capital. Participating units include the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, and other professional groups, as well as the Beijing New Song Chorus and the Beijing Middle School Music Teachers' Study Group Chorus. In addition to performing Nie Er's works, they will also perform other pieces.
	The Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast a commemorative program on the same day (July 17th) from 19:30 to 20:00 and from 21:30 to 21:50 during the art and literature program time. In addition to performances of Nie Er's posthumous works, the first program will also include a speech by Lü Ji, Chairman of the All-China Music Workers Association, commemorating Nie Er. The Beijing People's Broadcasting Station will also introduce Nie Er's life and broadcast his works in the student program from 8:45 to 9:15 on the same day.
	In addition, in order to promote creative activities and invigorate the musical life of the masses, the National Musicians Association has begun to systematically organize professional groups, singers, and instrumentalists in the capital to hold large-scale concerts. The first concert, held at the Palace of Culture of the Working People on June 24th, was attended by more than 6,000 people, including workers, cadres, and students. The program featured a variety of performances, including chorus, solo, rap, and ethnic instrumental music, all of which were warmly welcomed by the audience. This work is a good start to promoting future creative organization and mass music activities.
	General Association of the Chinese Medical Association Holds Expert Academic Discussion
	The General Association of the Chinese Medical Association held four expert academic discussions in Beijing from April 25th to June 20th to discuss the issue of hypertension. The meetings were presided over by Chairman Fu Lianzhang, and were attended by 15 medical experts in internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, neurology, physiology, and psychiatry. In addition, physicians from major hospitals and clinics in Beijing and traditional Chinese medicine students attended the lectures.
	The discussion began with one expert giving a general introduction to hypertension, followed by discussions and supplements by various experts on hypertension, and the widespread application of Pavlov's theory for analysis and research. For example, Professor Zhang Xijun not only used Pavlov's theory to explain the pathogenesis of hypertension, but also criticized his remarks published in 1949 that were inconsistent with Pavlov's theory. Professor Wu Yingkai also re-evaluated the treatment of hypertension with surgical sympathectomy based on Pavlov's theory. Mr. Zhu Yan of the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies School introduced the preliminary research on traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of hypertension at the meeting. The meeting called on everyone to pay attention to the excavation of the treasures of the old medicine of the motherland in the future, and to conduct research on traditional Chinese medicine with scientific methods.
	Participants in the meeting unanimously believed that such thematic discussions are of great help in strengthening academic research, improving academic standards, and uniting Chinese and Western medical personnel, and requested the General Association to continue to hold them in the future. According to everyone's requirements, the General Association of the Chinese Medical Association plans to continue to hold academic discussions on "diabetes," "peptic ulcer," and "neurasthenia," and prepare to publish these materials successively in the Chinese Medical Journal.
	Central-South China Establishes Writers Association
	The Central-South China Literary Workers Congress was held from June 26th to July 8th. The congress elected the Central-South China Writers Association Committee and formally established the Central-South China Writers Association.
	The congress heard the political report of Ye Jianying, Acting Secretary of the Central-South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Acting Chairman of the Central-South Administrative Committee, as well as reports on industrial construction and rural work; and heard the report on literary work by Yu Heiding, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Central-South China Writers Association.
	The meeting believed that in the past three years, the literary workers in Central-South China have gone deep into the masses, transformed themselves, and cooperated with the political movements in various periods of the motherland to carry out creation, and have achieved certain results. However, literary creation still lags behind the reality of the struggle and cannot meet the needs of the people. In order to fully reflect the reality of the struggle, serve the large-scale economic construction of the motherland, and educate the people with communist ideology, literary workers must better immerse themselves in life, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, and strive to create with the spirit of socialist realism.
	Through repeated study, the participants strengthened their understanding of the creative principles of socialist realism; recognized the importance of continuing to delve into life, strengthening learning, and conscientiously creating for the large-scale economic construction of the motherland; and unanimously decided to respond to the call of the congress with practical actions.
	In order to strengthen the specific leadership of creative activities, the congress decided to formally establish the Central-South China Writers Association; and elected the members of the Central-South China Writers Association and adopted the charter of the Central-South China Writers Association. Yu Heiding, Li Rui, Yu Lin and others were elected as chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Central-South China Writers Association among the members of the Central-South China Writers Association.

    聂耳逝世十八周年中华全国音乐工作者协会
    等单位将举行纪念音乐会
    今年七月十七日是我国人民音乐家聂耳逝世十八周年纪念日。中华全国音乐工作者协会及北京市文化事业管理处，为纪念这一位伟大的现实主义作曲家和中国革命音乐运动的开拓者，将在首都中山公园音乐堂举行音乐会。参加演出的单位，有：中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部文工团、中央实验歌剧院、中央歌舞团等专业团体，和北京市新歌合唱团、北京市中学音乐教师学习会合唱团等。他们除了演唱、演奏聂耳的作品外，还有其他作品。
    中央人民广播电台将在同日（七月十七日）晚上十九点三十分到二十点，和二十一点三十分至二十一点五十分的文艺节目时间播送纪念节目。除聂耳遗作的演唱外，在第一次节目里，并有中华全国音乐工作者协会主席吕骥为纪念聂耳发表的讲话。北京市人民广播电台亦将于同日八点四十五分到九点十五分的学生节目里，介绍聂耳的生平和播送聂耳的作品。
    又全国音协为了推动创作活动，活跃群众的音乐生活，已开始有计划地组织首都各专业团体和演唱家、演奏家，举行规模较大的音乐会。六月二十四日在劳动人民文化宫举行的第一次音乐会，到会的听众有工人、机关干部、学生等共六千余人。演出的节目多种多样，有合唱、独唱、说唱、和民族乐器演奏等，都受到听众热烈的欢迎。这一工作，是推动今后组织创作和开展群众音乐活动一个很好的开始。
    中华医学会总会举行专家学术讨论会
    中华医学会总会于四月二十五日至六月二十日期间，在北京举行了四次专家学术讨论会，研讨高血压症问题。会议由傅连暲理事长主持，参加的有内、外、眼、神经科以及生理学、精神病学等科医学专家十五人。此外并有北京市各大医院诊所医师及中医进修学校的中医参加听讲。
    讨论会首先由专家一人对高血压症作一概括介绍，然后由各专家分别就高血压症展开讨论与补充，并普遍地应用巴夫洛夫学说来进行分析研究。例如，张锡钧教授不但用巴夫洛夫学说阐明了高血压症的发病机转，还批判了他在一九四九年发表的与巴夫洛夫学说不符的言论。吴英恺教授也根据巴夫洛夫学说，对外科交感神经节切除术治疗高血压症的疗法作了重新的估价。北京中医进修学校朱颜先生在会上介绍了中药对治疗高血压症的初步研究。会议号召大家今后应重视发掘祖国旧有医药的宝藏，用科学的方法对中医中药进行研究。
    参加会议的一致认为这样的专题讨论会，对加强学术研究，提高学术水平及中西医务人员的团结，都有很大帮助，要求总会今后继续举办。根据大家要求，中华医学会总会计划继续举办“糖尿病”、
    “消化性溃疡”及“神经衰弱”等学术讨论会，并准备将这些材料陆续在中华医学杂志上发表。
    中南成立作家协会
    中南文学工作者代表大会于六月二十六日至七月八日举行。大会选出中南作家协会委员会，正式成立了中南作家协会。
    大会听取了中共中央中南局代书记、中南行政委员会代主席叶剑英的政治报告及有关工业建设、农村工作的报告；并听取了中南作家协会筹备委员会主任于黑丁关于文学工作的报告。
    会议认为三年来中南文学工作者深入群众、改造自己、配合祖国各个时期的政治运动进行创作，取得了一定的成绩。但文学创作依然落后于现实斗争，不能满足人民群众的要求。为了能充分地反映现实斗争，为祖国大规模的经济建设服务，和用共产主义思想教育人民，文学工作者就必须更好地深入生活，加强马克思、列宁主义学习，掌握社会主义现实主义创作精神努力进行创作。
    通过反复的研究学习，到会人员加强了对社会主义现实主义创作原则的理解；认识了继续深入生活，加强学习，认真创作为祖国大规模经济建设服务的重要性；并一致决定要以实际行动响应大会的号召。
    为加强对创作活动的具体领导，大会决议正式成立中南作家协会；并选出中南作家协会委员和通过了中南作家协会章程。中南作家协会委员中又选出于黑丁、李蕤、俞林等为正副主席。
