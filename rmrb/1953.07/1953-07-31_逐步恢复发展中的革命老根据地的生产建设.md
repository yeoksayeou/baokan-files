Gradually Restore the Production and Construction of Revolutionary Old Base Areas
National Old Revolutionary Base Areas Construction Committee Office

With the cordial care and strong support of the Party and the government, the people of the old revolutionary base areas have gradually restored production after two or three years of efforts, their lives are improving day by day, and the face of the old base areas has been initially changed.

The people of the old revolutionary base areas made great contributions of manpower and material resources in the long revolutionary struggle and established great achievements for the revolutionary cause. In the revolutionary struggle, the people of the old revolutionary base areas were also cruelly killed by the enemy, and production was severely destroyed. In order to comfort the people of the old revolutionary base areas and help them restore production and rebuild their homes, in 1951, the Central People's Government organized the North and South Old Revolutionary Base Areas Visiting Groups to visit the old areas and encourage the people of the old revolutionary base areas to build confidence in production and construction. In January 1952, the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on Strengthening the Work of Old Revolutionary Base Areas," pointing out that the people's governments at all levels with old revolutionary base areas under their jurisdiction should take the restoration and construction of old revolutionary base areas as one of the key tasks in 1952. The Central People's Government and local people's governments simultaneously supported the people of the old revolutionary base areas with great economic strength.

With the strong support of the Party and the government, the people of the old revolutionary base areas, after a series of political movements, and on the basis of obtaining land and other means of production, responded with unprecedented labor enthusiasm to Chairman Mao's great call to "get organized and develop production." In Longyan, Yongding, and Shanghang counties in Fujian Province, 70% of the 402 base villages participated in mutual aid teams; in Wu'an, Jianping, and other counties in Hebei Province, more than 70% of the total population participated in mutual aid teams. With the widespread development of the agricultural cooperative mutual aid movement, agricultural production in the old revolutionary base areas has been rapidly improved. In the 24 counties of the old revolutionary base areas in Hunan Province, grain production in 1952 increased by 50% compared with before liberation. In the old revolutionary base areas of Fujian Province, the unit area yield has been restored to the level of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. In the drought prevention and drought resistance movement, the old revolutionary base areas vigorously built water conservancy projects. In the past year, the old revolutionary base areas in northern Sichuan repaired more than 19,600 ponds and weirs, increasing the irrigated area by more than 209,000 mu. In the spring of last year, 80 counties in the old revolutionary base areas of North China expanded paddy fields by more than 910,000 mu. Many water conservancy projects that had not been repaired for a long time have also been repaired. Farmers in Gujiadong, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, wanted to build a weir 80 years ago, but it could not be realized because the landlord used the excuse that it would destroy "feng shui." Now, not only has the weir been built, but also the canal, turning thousands of acres of paddy fields that had "two disasters in three years" into good land with "three crops and three harvests." Animal husbandry in the old revolutionary base areas has also been greatly developed due to government loans, support, and technical guidance. The old areas of the former Chahar Province now have an average of one head of livestock and two sheep per household. The old revolutionary base areas of Shaanxi Province plan to increase the number of sheep to 650,000 by the end of this year, an increase of 44% over 1952, and the number of goats to 700,000, an increase of 27% over 1952. Veterinary stations and breeding stations have been generally established in mountainous areas to support the development of livestock. The plan of "herds of mules and horses, cattle and sheep all over the mountains" has been initially realized in many old revolutionary base areas.

Developing transportation and trade is the urgent requirement of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. The old revolutionary base areas are generally located in remote mountainous areas, where transportation is inconvenient and material exchanges are extremely difficult. The scissors difference between local agricultural and sideline products and industrial products from other places is very large, which has greatly affected the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. Therefore, various places have spent great efforts in building roads and developing transportation. Sichuan Province plans to build 800 kilometers of highways, 1,000 kilometers of post roads, and 2,470 kilometers of sidewalks in the old revolutionary base areas of northern Sichuan in three years starting in 1952. This plan is currently being implemented. Anhui Province has built 649 kilometers of highways in the Dabie Mountains. The development of roads has promoted material exchanges and improved people's lives. The situation that the people of many old revolutionary base areas have not eaten salt for many years has been changed. In some areas, 20 to 30 jin of rice could only be exchanged for one jin of salt before liberation, but now only 5 jin of rice are needed. Due to smooth sales channels, the papermaking industry in the old revolutionary base areas of Fujian Province has been able to restore 1,214 paper troughs. The silver ear, fungus, medicinal materials, and other special products of the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area have been unsalable for a long time before liberation. Now the price has increased by two to five times. The annual purchase volume of state-owned trading companies alone has increased farmers' income by more than 1.55 billion yuan. With the active economic market, cooperatives and trade purchasing stations have been generally established in the old revolutionary base areas, and a large number of private merchants have been organized to purchase local specialties, which has powerfully promoted the trade in the old revolutionary base areas and helped the restoration and development of production.

Cultural, educational, and health undertakings in the old revolutionary base areas have also made great progress during this period. Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces have all achieved one primary school per township. Not only do emancipated peasants actively send their children to school, but they also urgently demand to improve their culture. At present, the vast majority of old revolutionary base areas have generally established farmers' night schools and literacy classes to carry out literacy work. The sanitary conditions in general old revolutionary base areas are poor, people suffer from many diseases, and the infant mortality rate is also high. At present, various places are actively training new health workers, uniting and transforming traditional Chinese medicine, and gradually establishing health institutions. In Jiangxi Province, there is now a health center for every two districts. Hunan Province can achieve one health center per district this year. Various places have trained a large number of epidemic prevention personnel and carried out health and epidemic prevention work, so that the prevalence of smallpox, measles, and other diseases in many areas has been basically curbed. In the past winter and spring, Fujian Province sent nine mobile medical teams to the old revolutionary base areas to provide medical treatment for the people. The Minxi medical team treated more than 36,000 people free of charge in four months, and was welcomed by the people of the old revolutionary base areas.

With the restoration and development of production and construction, the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas have been greatly improved. In the 53 old revolutionary base counties of Fujian Province, more than 77,000 houses have been built in the past three years. In order to further improve the living standards of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, Shanxi Province put forward the slogan of "turning barren mountains into orchards" within three years. In 1952, the province planted more than 4 million fruit trees of various kinds, such as apples, pears, walnuts, and jujubes.

Although the work in the old revolutionary base areas has achieved considerable results in the past few years, the development is uneven. The old revolutionary base areas have suffered serious damage from the enemy. In addition, the leading departments in some areas have not paid enough attention to this work, lack longer-term restoration and construction plans, or the plans are unrealistic, and the coordination between the relevant departments is also poor, resulting in the lives of some people in the old revolutionary base areas not yet catching up with the living standards of the people in general areas, and there are still many difficulties in production and life that need to be helped to solve. Therefore, in the future, the old revolutionary base areas must earnestly implement the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Strengthening the Work of Old Revolutionary Base Areas," adhere to the principle of "combining solving the current livelihood difficulties of the masses with long-term construction," and first strengthen the leadership of the work in the old revolutionary base areas, give play to the political enthusiasm and potential strength of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, carry forward the fine revolutionary traditions, and always become an advanced area in work. At the same time, we must educate cadres to recognize the important significance of this work, and organize forces to conduct in-depth investigations and understand the restoration and construction of the old revolutionary base areas, and carry out work in a focused, step-by-step, and division-of-labor manner according to different regions, in order to gradually meet the requirements of the people in the old revolutionary base areas and further improve the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas.

At present, the provinces with old revolutionary base areas are summarizing past work, checking and correcting shortcomings, and formulating three- to five-year restoration and construction plans, focusing on supporting areas that have suffered too much damage from the enemy, so that the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas will gradually reach the living standards of the people in general areas. Now the people in the old revolutionary base areas are not satisfied with the existing achievements. They deeply remember Chairman Mao's call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" and are confidently moving towards a better and happier life.

    逐步恢复发展中的革命老根据地的生产建设
    全国老根据地建设委员会办公室
    革命老根据地人民在党和政府的亲切关怀与大力扶持下，经过两三年的努力，已逐步恢复生产，生活日益改善，使老根据地面貌初步改观。
    革命老根据地人民在长期革命斗争中，曾贡献了巨大的人力和物力，为革命事业建立了丰功伟绩。在革命斗争中，老根据地人民同时遭受到敌人残酷的杀害，生产受到严重的摧残。为了慰问老根据地人民，并帮助老根据地人民恢复生产，重建家园，一九五一年，中央人民政府组织了南北方老根据地访问团，深入老区访问，鼓舞了老根据地人民生产建设的信心。一九五二年一月，政务院又发布了
    “关于加强老根据地工作的指示”，指出凡辖区有老根据地的各级人民政府，要把老根据地的恢复与建设工作作为一九五二年的工作重点之一。中央人民政府及各地人民政府同时以极大的经济力量支援老根据地人民。
    老根据地人民在党和政府的大力支持下，经过一系列的政治运动，在获得土地和其他生产资料的基础上，以空前的劳动热忱响应了毛主席“组织起来，发展生产”的伟大号召。福建省龙岩、永定、上杭三个县四百零二个基点村参加互助组的农民占总户数的百分之七十，河北省武安、建屏等县参加互助组的人口占总人口的百分之七十以上。随着农业合作互助运动的广泛开展，老根据地的农业生产得到迅速提高。湖南省老根据地二十四个县，一九五二年粮食生产比解放前增加了百分之五十，福建省老根据地单位面积产量均已恢复到第二次国内革命战争时期的水平。在防旱抗旱运动中，各老根据地大力兴修水利。川北老根据地去年一年中整修塘堰一万九千六百余处，增加灌溉面积二十万九千余亩。华北老根据地八十个县在去年春天即扩大水田九十一万多亩。许多长久未能兴修的水利工程也得到兴修。湖南省平江县辜家洞农民早在八十年前即想修
    一条堰圳，但因地主藉口不能破坏“风水”而未能实现。现在不但修了堰而且修了圳，使“三年两灾”的几千亩水田，变成“三种三收”的好土地。老根据地的畜牧事业，由于政府贷款扶持和技术指导，也得到很大发展。原察哈尔省的老区县份，已平均每户有一头牲畜、两只羊。陕西省老根据地计划到今年年底，绵羊可增加到六十五万只，较一九五二年增加百分之四十四，山羊增加到七十万只，较一九五二年增加百分之二十七。各地在山区普遍设立了兽医站、配种站，扶助牲畜的发展。“骡马成群，牛羊满山”的计划，在许多老根据地已经初步实现了。
    开发交通、发展贸易是老根据地人民的迫切要求。老根据地一般是处在边远山区，交通不便，物资交流异常困难，当地农副业产品与外地工业产品的剪刀差很大，使老根据地人民生活受到很大的影响。因此，各地在修筑公路，开发交通方面花了很大力量。四川省计划从一九五二年起三年内在川北老根据地修筑公路八百公里、驿道一千公里、人行道二千四百七十公里，目前这一计划正在实现中。安徽省大别山区已修公路六百四十九公里。公路的开发，促进了物资交流，改善了人民的生活。许多老根据地人民长年吃不到盐的情况已经改变。有的地区，解放前二、三十斤大米才能换一斤盐，现在只要五斤大米。福建省老根据地造纸事业由于销路畅通，已有一千二百十四所纸槽得以恢复。川陕边区特产的银耳、木耳、药材等，解放前长期滞销，现在价格提高了两倍至五倍，仅国营贸易公司一年收购量即使农民增加收益十五亿五千多万元。随着经济市场的活跃，老根据地现已普遍建立起合作社、贸易收购站，并组织大批私商收购土特产，有力地推动了老根据地的贸易，帮助了生产的恢复与发展。
    老根据地的文化教育卫生事业，在这一时期也有了很大发展。江西、四川、湖南等省，均已达到每乡有一所小学。翻身农民不仅积极送子弟入学，自己也迫切要求提高文化。目前绝大多数老根据地已普遍设立了农民夜校和识字班，开展了扫盲工作。一般老根据地卫生条件较差，人民疾病较多，婴儿死亡率也高。目前各地正积极培养新的卫生工作人员，团结改造中医，逐步建立卫生机构。江西省每两个区已有一个卫生所。湖南省今年可以达到每一区有一个卫生所。各地曾训练了大批防疫人员，开展卫生防疫工作，使许多地区的天花、麻疹等流行疾病得以基本制止。福建省去冬今春派了九个巡回医疗队，到老根据地为人民医疗疾病。闽西医疗队在四个月时间内免费医疗了三万六千多人，受到老根据地人民的欢迎。
    随着生产建设的恢复与发展，老根据地人民的生活已得到很大改善。福建省五十三个老根据地县份三年来修盖房屋七万七千余间。为了进一步提高老根据地人民的生活水平，山西省提出了三年内“变荒山为果园”的口号，一九五二年全省已栽植苹果、梨、核桃、枣等各种果树四百万株以上。
    几年来老革命根据地的工作虽获得不小成绩，但发展是不平衡的。老根据地遭受敌人摧残严重，加之有些地区领导部门对这一工作还没有足够的重视，缺乏较长期的恢复建设计划或计划不切实际，各有关部门互相配合也较差，致部分老根据地人民的生活，还没有赶上一般地区人民的生活水平，并在生产和生活上仍有不少困难，需待帮助解决。因此，今后老根据地仍须切实贯彻政务院“关于加强老根据地工作的指示”，本着“解决群众当前生活困难与长期建设相结合”的方针，首先应加强老根据地工作的领导，发挥老根据地人民的政治积极性和潜在力量，发扬革命优良传统，永远成为工作上的先进地区。同时教育干部认识这一工作的重要意义，并组织力量深入调查了解老根据地恢复与建设情况，根据不同地区有重点有步骤有分工地进行工作，以期逐步达到老根据地人民的要求，进一步改善老根据地人民的生活。
    目前各革命老根据地省份，正在总结过去工作，检查纠正缺点，制订三、五年内的恢复建设计划，重点扶持遭受敌人摧残过重的地区，使老根据地人民生活逐步达到一般地区人民的生活水平。现在老根据地人民并不满足现有成绩，他们深深记得毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的号召，满怀信心地向着更美好更幸福的生活迈进。
