(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 7th) Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Another new plot by Syngman Rhee to sabotage the Korean armistice is brewing.

    News from Seoul indicates that Won Yong-duk, the South Korean Military Police Commander who was responsible for Syngman Rhee's "release" of more than 27,000 prisoners of war, stated through his spokesperson on the 5th that if an armistice agreement is signed, he would take "drastic action" to sabotage it.

    The reason why the Syngman Rhee gang dares to be so rampant is obviously because they see that every action they are preparing to take to undermine the armistice is being encouraged by the United States.

    One of the "drastic actions" Syngman Rhee is preparing to take is to once again kidnap all the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war. News from Seoul says that Syngman Rhee and his senior officers are preparing to "release" the North Korean prisoners of war still held in U.S. prisoner of war camps, and the non-directly repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Jeju Island. In order to realize this conspiracy, a large number of Rhee's puppet troops have been transferred to the Busan area, and Syngman Rhee's newly appointed Minister of National Defense, Son Won-il, has arrived in Busan. The collusion between Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang gang is also intensifying. Wang Dongyuan, Chiang Kai-shek's agent in South Korea, is active, and it is said that Syngman Rhee has promised to do his best to "release" the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. In this volatile situation, the United States has so far not expressed any intention to stop Syngman Rhee's sabotage activities, but has repeatedly emphasized that the United States has decided to avoid any conflict between the U.S. military and Syngman Rhee's army. This is clearly an extremely blatant encouragement of Syngman Rhee's provocative behavior.

    Another "drastic action" Syngman Rhee is preparing to take is to refuse to accept the armistice and refuse to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. A confidant of Syngman Rhee said yesterday that Syngman Rhee is prepared to order his troops to continue fighting. This confidant of Syngman Rhee also said, "In the initial stage, we may lose one or two divisions. But the United States will not be able to get away. They will have to fight with us."

    There is no doubt that Syngman Rhee is determined to sabotage the armistice. When Robertson came out after meeting with Syngman Rhee yesterday, he encountered a demonstration specifically arranged by Syngman Rhee of people who were "anti-armistice." The demonstrators shouted "March Northward" and "Unification" to Robertson.... But Robertson said: These demonstrators "did not have a hostile attitude." Does the United States want an armistice? Or is it determined to encourage Syngman Rhee to continue fighting? Now is the time for the United States to answer this question to the world.

### 李承晚破坏停战的阴谋继续受到美国鼓励

    李承晚破坏停战的阴谋继续受到美国鼓励
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者江南报道：李承晚又一个破坏朝鲜停战的新阴谋正在酝酿中。
    来自汉城的消息说，曾负责执行李承晚“释放”二万七千多战俘的南朝鲜宪兵司令元容德，在五日通过他的发言人表示，如果停战协定签订，他就要采取“剧烈行动”来加以破坏。
    李承晚匪帮之所以敢于如此猖狂，显然是因为他们看到：他们准备采取的破坏停战的每一个行动，都在受到美国方面的鼓励。
    李承晚准备采取的“剧烈行动”之一，就是再一次把剩下的不直接遣返的战俘全部架走。汉城方面的消息说，李承晚和他的高级军官们正在准备“释放”还留在美方战俘营中的北朝鲜战俘，和在济州岛上的不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。为了实现这一项阴谋，大批李伪军已经调到釜山地区，李承晚新任命的国防部长官孙元一已经到达釜山。李承晚和国民党匪帮之间的勾结也日益加紧。蒋匪在南朝鲜的代理人王东原活动频繁，据说李承晚已答应尽力把中国人民志愿军被俘人员“释放”。在这种一触即发的局势下面，美国方面迄今还没有制止李承晚这种破坏活动的表示，反而一再强调说，美国已经决定避免在美国军队和李承晚军队之间发生任何冲突。这显然是对李承晚的挑衅行为的一种极其露骨的鼓励。
    李承晚准备采取的另一个“剧烈行动”，就是拒绝接受停战，拒绝撤出非军事区。李承晚的一个亲信在昨天说，李承晚准备命令他的军队继续打下去。这个李承晚的亲信还说，“在初期，我们可能会损失一两个师的。但是美国就无法脱身。他们将不得不与我们一起作战。”
    李承晚决心要破坏停战，这是无可怀疑的了。昨天罗伯逊和李承晚会谈完毕走出来的时候，碰到了李承晚特地布置的一个“反停战”的示威，示威者向罗伯逊高喊“向北挺进”、“统一”……。而罗伯逊却说：这些示威的人“并没有敌对的态度”。究竟美国是要停战呢？还是决心鼓励李承晚打下去呢？现在是美国向全世界回答这个问题的时候了。
