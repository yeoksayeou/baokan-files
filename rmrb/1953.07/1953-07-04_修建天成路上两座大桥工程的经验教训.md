    Lessons Learned from the Construction of Two Bridges on the Tiancheng Railway
    Hong Liu

    Both the Shiting River Bridge and the Fu River Bridge on the Tiancheng Railway needed to be completed before the flood season. Both bridge construction areas had working groups with cadres from the Second Engineering Bureau's political department and the Communist Youth League as their backbone. The Shiting River Bridge was completed eleven days ahead of schedule, while the Fu River Bridge was still in a dangerous state just days before the flood season.

    Construction of the Shiting River Bridge began on November 12, 1952. It had sixteen bridge piers, seventeen spans, and a total length of 247 meters, making it a complex project. The construction area director, Sun Yixuan, looked down on the workers, often saying, "Workers are just muddy legs; they just accept orders and work!" and "With machines and materials, the bridge can be built!" The four foremen all had a bad attitude towards the workers. Foreman Luo Tianxi even scolded the workers, saying, "Why were you born so stupid! It doesn't matter if you work or not; it's no big deal if you're here or not." There were also deep divisions between the foremen, between the foremen and the squad leaders, technicians, and the construction area director. The foremen didn't know the plans made by the construction area director, and the foremen, squad leaders, and workers were all clueless about production. They said, "Sun the bureaucrat is leading us like blind mules!"

    "We're crossing the river on a blind donkey, just going wherever we go." Cement workers, mechanical workers, pile drivers, excavation workers, and carpenters all did their own work, blaming each other when they encountered difficulties. In mid-to-late November and December 1952, excavation only completed 32.5 percent of the plan, pile driving only completed 11.2 percent of the plan, and in January 1953, the project only completed 30 percent of the plan. Che Wenyi, the head of the working group sent to the Shiting River Bridge construction area and the organization minister of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Second Engineering Bureau, mobilized the masses, relied on the broad masses of workers, and united and improved the technical personnel led by Sun Yixuan. Sun Yixuan, who was scolded by the workers as "Sun the bureaucrat," gradually realized that "nothing can be done without relying on the workers." As a result, he went from not caring about the workers' lives, not issuing plans, and not making unit prices public, to promptly solving the difficulties in the workers' lives and work, making plans public, making unit prices public, and consulting with the masses about everything.

    However, the work of the Shiting River Bridge construction area working group did not go smoothly. When the working group comrades began to talk to Sun Yixuan about the work situation and reflect the workers' opinions about the leadership, Sun Yixuan concluded that "the working group is here specifically to find fault." Therefore, he avoided the working group members from a distance. When he couldn't avoid them, he was determined to "listen with one ear and let it out the other." Sometimes, when the working group comrades spoke urgently, he would say, "Comrade, let's forget it, don't do political work on me!" Sun Yixuan's unwillingness to approach the working group made it very difficult for the working group to carry out its work. Che Wenyi felt that it was no use being anxious, so he told the group members to humbly learn technology from Sun Yixuan, respect the technical personnel, sincerely help him, and mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals to make up for the shortcomings in his plans.

    In mid-February, the first engineering section held a staff and worker representative meeting, and Sun Yixuan attended. At the meeting, some people reported on the experience of relying on the worker masses to do a good job, and others reported on the lessons of failing to work by breaking away from the masses. After listening to these reports, Sun Yixuan began to feel that there was a problem with his work. Che Wenyi took the opportunity to talk to Sun Yixuan: "We have no objection to your enthusiasm for work, but what is the effect of you being so busy that you don't even have time to eat? You have exhausted your own strength, but everyone's strength cannot be used, and the production tasks are still not completed!" Then Che Wenyi brought up the masses' opinions about him one by one, helped him analyze the reasons why the tasks had not been completed in the past, and helped him convene a meeting of the heads of various units. Before the meeting, the working group cadres had already talked to the leaders of the mechanical group and the excavation team to get their ideas across, so this meeting was no longer about mutual complaints and grievances, but about each person examining the shortcomings in their work and proposing ways to cooperate with each other. The meeting was relatively successful. The task was 65 percent completed in February, which was an improvement over January.

    At this time, Sun Yixuan also gradually took the initiative to discuss problems with the comrades of the working group. The gap between the working group and the construction area leadership was broken. But Sun Yixuan still didn't believe in the power of the workers enough. The working group comrades went further to study the problems in production with the workers, and used the workers' many creative suggestions to further strengthen and consolidate Sun Yixuan's ideology of relying on the working class.

    At the beginning of March, when Sun Yixuan was making a plan to build concrete bridge piers, he didn't calculate the materials. As soon as the plan was announced, the carpenter Shi Youxu came to ask Sun Yixuan: "Director Sun, we have a plan, but I don't know if there are any other cement boards in the construction area?" Sun Yixuan replied: "It's just that pile of boards in the yard!" Shi Youxu said: "There are not enough boards!" Shi Youxu took Sun Yixuan to the carpentry shop, pointed to the cement board and gestured: "This piece is for the upper surface of the bridge pier, that piece is for the lower surface of the bridge pier, one bridge pier, two bridge piers, three bridge piers... there is a big difference!" Sun Yixuan couldn't answer when he heard this, and it took a while before he said: "I have never carefully considered the materials when making plans in the past, what should I do?" Shi Youxu pointed to the sleeper ends on the ground (the overlong ends cut off from the sleepers) and said: "Director Sun, there are so many sleeper ends here, it would be great to cut them into cement boards, so that we can make up for it." This rationalization proposal made Sun Yixuan smile.

    In mid-March, the excavation work of the Shiting River Bridge was proceeding to the deep water No. 1 and No. 2 bridge piers. Originally, Sun Yixuan planned to build the No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 bridge piers at the same time, but he didn't consider that the No. 1 and 2 bridge piers had three inches of clear water and five meters and two inches of dark water. How could they excavate with so much water? Several workers from the mechanical team were anxious. They made an appointment with the excavation foreman Chen Qihua to go to a place two kilometers upstream to observe. They saw that the local people had built old dams for diverting water to irrigate the fields. After consulting with the local people, they completely filled in the old dams, so that all the water flowed into the irrigation ditches, and then diverted the leaking water from between the No. 9 and No. 10 bridge piers. In this way, the No. 1 and No. 2 bridge piers had no clear water at all, and the dark water was also small. These two bridge piers could be completed on schedule, and a pumping fee was also saved. These rationalization proposals from the workers made Sun Yixuan realize: "It turns out that my plan was very rough. Without the rationalization proposals from the workers, the plan would have failed again!"

    Another incident was also very enlightening for Sun Yixuan. When building a deep-water bridge pier, sand was suddenly dug out from below. Therefore, the original design without pile driving had to be changed to driving twenty-four thick wooden piles. But when driving the twenty-first pile, three thin cracks were found in the pile driver's guide pipe, one centimeter vertical crack on the left root, two centimeters vertical crack on the right root, and two centimeters horizontal crack. If it was stopped for repairs, it would delay several days. The water was rising, and this delay would add great difficulties to the project. Sun Yixuan was very anxious and couldn't think of a solution. But this difficulty was solved by the workers' wisdom and collective strength. Crane workers Xu Si'an and Wu Fengwei suggested transferring the force on the guide pipe to the steel wire rope. Xu Si'an found a way to solve the problem of the pile hoisting end being straight. The foreman found a way to use iron wire to bind the垫子 to reduce the upper wear. Mechanical worker Xia Liangyao suggested that he stand on the gantry ladder behind the guide pipe to monitor whether the crack was expanding. If it expanded, he would tell the worker in charge of the oil gate to close the oil gate to ensure that the work could continue without danger. Mechanical team leader Lin Yinghua checked the machine at any time to keep it running normally. In this way, under the joint labor of various workers in good cooperation, all the last four piles were driven in that afternoon. At the end of work, Sun Yixuan said very moved: "Good methods were thought out by many workers together, I couldn't think of them in a month!" He also realized: "The working group comrades go deep into the workers not to collect my shortcomings and mobilize the workers to fight me, but to help me correct my shortcomings and complete the production tasks." He took the initiative to find the working group comrades more. After his own thinking changed, he went to influence the four foremen and persuaded them to rely on the workers. On April 9, the bridge project was completed eleven days ahead of schedule.

    However, the situation at the Fu River Bridge construction area was different.

    The Fu River Bridge has eighteen bridge piers, nineteen spans, and a total length of 371 meters. It was originally scheduled to start construction on November 15, 1952, but it was not officially started until December 4 due to insufficient preparation work. Because the design documents were late, open excavation was carried out before February 20, and on February 20, the open excavation was switched to the down-opening caisson, and fourteen pumps were concentrated on the caisson of the No. 14 bridge pier. In March, the caisson work of No. 11, 13, 15, and 16 bridge piers started one after another, but because the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers to pay attention to waterproofing were rejected by the leadership of the construction area, they only wanted to rely on the higher authorities to issue more pumps, resulting in very slow progress and wasting a lot of gasoline. For example, when the No. 16 bridge pier was caissoned, even concentrating thirteen pumps could not pump it dry. The leading cadres of the construction area emphasized that there were not enough pumps. The workers suggested one after another: "Let's carry out another surrounding masonry work!" Tang Shifu, the acting deputy director of the construction area, said: "What can this solve?" As a result, a lot of gasoline was wasted, and finally, the surrounding masonry work was carried out before the water in the No. 16 caisson was quickly pumped dry. Because the leading cadres did not rely on the working class and could not solve the problems existing among the workers in time, the construction plan of the bridge construction area from January to April all failed. In the first quarter, the plan was to excavate 14,461 cubic meters, but only 10,000 cubic meters were completed. The plan was to pour 663 cubic meters of cement, but only 451 cubic meters were completed. In April, the plan was to complete all five caissons of No. 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 bridge piers, but only two caissons of No. 15 and 16 were completed. The project was still in a dangerous state just days before the flood season. After the working group of the Fu River Bridge construction area came to the construction site, it failed to promptly save this danger. They engaged in political work divorced from production. The head of the working group did not go down the mountain for twenty-five consecutive days, and lived on the high hillside to lead the political study of the construction area. He was busy listening to reports every day, putting aside the major issues of the construction area leadership in the arduous bridge project that was racing against the flood, and how to complete the production tasks. When the good opportunity for construction was delayed, and the tense situation of fifty-nine pumps fighting against the flood was artificially created, the leading cadres of the working group did not mobilize the masses in connection with production, but used all the original party and youth league forces of the working group to engage in political study. With only a few days left before the flood season, the caisson of No. 14 bridge pier was still submerged in water, and the cement had not been poured. No. 12 bridge pier was still concentrating pumps to sink the caisson. On the river near the bridge, a layer of yellow gasoline was floating on the water. The workers said very painfully: "What kind of leadership is this, this is pouring our country's RMB into the water!"

    The Shiting River Bridge and the Fu River Bridge are two such obvious examples! It once again teaches us: In enterprises, all personnel must face production and must rely on the working class!

    修建天成路上两座大桥工程的经验教训
    洪流
    天成铁路石亭江大桥和涪江大桥都需要在洪水期前竣工，两个桥工区都派有以第二工程局政治部、青年团干部为骨干的工作组；石亭江桥较原计划提前十一天修成，涪江桥直至距洪水期仅有几天时，工程仍处在危险阶段。
    石亭江桥于一九五二年十一月十二日开工，共十六个桥墩、十七孔，全长二百四十七公尺，工程复杂。工区主任孙亦譞看不起工人，常说：“工人是泥巴腿子，接受命令作活就成了！”“有机器和材料就可把桥造起来！”四个领工员对工人的态度都很坏，领工员罗天喜甚至骂工人说：“你怎么生得这么笨！你干不干无所谓，有你不多，无你不少。”而领工员相互间，领工员与中队长、技术员、工区主任之间都有很深的隔阂。工区主任订的计划领工员不知道，领工员、中队长、工人都对生产心中无数，他们说：“孙官僚把我们当黑骡子牵着走！”
    “我们骑瞎毛驴过河，走到那里算那里吧。”水泥工、机械工、打桩工、挖基工、木工也都各干各的活，遇到困难，互相埋怨。一九五二年十一月中下旬和十二月份，挖基仅完成计划百分之三十二点五，打桩仅完成计划百分之十一点二，一九五三年一月份，工程仅完成计划百分之三十。派到石亭江桥工区的工作组组长第二工程局青年团工委组织部长车文义同志发动了群众，依靠广大工人，团结和提高了以孙亦譞为首的技术人员，使被工人骂为“孙官僚”的孙亦譞逐渐认识到“不依靠工人，啥事情都办不成”，因而从不关心工人生活，不下达计划，不公开单价，转变为及时解决工人生活及工作中的困难，公开计划，公开单价，有事和群众商量。
    但石亭江桥工区工作组在进行工作时，并不是一帆风顺的。当工作组同志开始和孙亦譞谈工作情况，反映工人们对领导的意见时，孙亦譞就认定“工作组是专来找岔子的”，因此一见着工作组的人就远远避开，在避不开时，他就抱定“你讲吧，我一只耳朵听进去，一只耳朵跑出去”的态度；有时工作组同志说急了，他就说：“同志，算了吧，你别对我作政治工作！”孙亦譞这种不愿和工作组接近的态度使工作组进行工作发生很大困难。车文义觉得急了不成，便告诉组员们要虚心向孙亦譞学技术，尊重技术人员，诚恳地帮助他，并发动群众提合理化建议来补他计划中的缺点。
    二月中旬一工程段开职工代表会议，孙亦譞去参加了。会上有人报告了依靠工人群众做好工作的经验，也有人报告了脱离群众工作失败的教训，孙亦譞听了这些报告，开始觉得自己的工作有问题。车文义就乘热打铁找孙亦譞谈：“我们对你的工作积极性一点没意见，但你忙得连吃饭的时间都没有，收到的是什么效果呢？你一个人力量出尽了，大家力量都使不出来，生产任务仍是完不成！”接着车文义把群众对他的意见一条一条提出来，帮助他分析过去任务完不成的原因，又帮助他召开了各单位负责人的会议。在开会前，工作组干部已分头和机械组、挖基班的领导人谈通了思想，所以在这次会议上，就不再是互相埋怨、诉苦，而是各人检查自己工作中的缺点，提出相互配合的办法，会议开得比较成功。二月份完成计划百分之六十五，较一月份提高了。
    孙亦譞这时也渐渐自动找工作组的同志商量问题。工作组与工区领导间的隔阂打破了。但孙亦譞对工人的力量还不够相信。工作组同志又进一步地去和工人研究生产中的问题，用工人的许多创造性的建议来进一步加强和巩固孙亦譞的依靠工人阶级的思想。
    三月初，孙亦譞订打水泥桥墩的计划时，没有把材料计算一下。计划一公布，木工石有绪来问孙亦譞：“孙主任，计划有了，但不知道工区另外还有水泥板子没有？”孙亦譞答说：“就是场子里那堆板子！”石有绪说：“板子不够！”石有绪带孙亦譞到木工场，指着水泥板比划着手势说：“这块作桥墩上层那一面，那块作桥墩下层那一面，一个桥墩，两个桥墩，三个桥墩……差得多呢！”孙亦譞一听，答不出话来，好一会才说：“过去订计划从没仔细考虑过材料，怎么办呢？”石有绪就指着地下的枕木头（枕木锯下的过长的头面）说：“孙主任，这里有这么多的枕木头子，把它截成水泥板多好，这样就补足了。”这个合理化建议把孙亦譞说得眉开眼笑了。
    三月中旬，石亭江大桥挖基工作正进行到深水第一号、第二号桥墩，原先孙亦譞计划一、二、三、四号桥墩同时作，但没有考虑到一、二号桥墩有三公寸明水，还有五公尺二公寸暗水，有这样大的水怎样挖法？机械队的几个工人着急了，他们约了挖基领工员陈齐华走到上流两公里的地方去察看，看见那里有老乡做好的分水灌田的老坝，他们商得老乡同意后，把老坝完全填死，使水都流到灌溉沟里去，再把漏水从第九号、第十号桥墩之间引过去。这样第一、二号桥墩完全没有明水，暗水也小了，这两个桥墩都能按计划如期完成，还节省了一笔抽水费。工人们的这些合理化建议使孙亦譞认识到：“原来自己的计划很粗糙，要没有工人同志的合理化建议，计划又失败了！”
    另外一件事对孙亦譞启发也很大。打一个深水桥墩时，突然下面挖出沙子，因此，原来不打桩的设计要改变为打二十四根粗桩木。但在打到第二十一根桩木时，打桩机导管发现了三条细裂纹，左根竖裂一公寸，右根竖裂二公分，又横裂二公分，如停下来修理，要耽误好几天。水正在上涨，这一耽误会给工程增加很大困难。孙亦譞很着急，想不出办法。但这个困难在工人的智慧和集体的力量下解决了。起重工徐思安、武凤维提议将导管承受力量转移到钢丝绳上，徐思安想法解决了桩吊端直，领工员想法用铁丝缚垫子，减轻上部磨耗；机械工人夏良耀建议他站在导管后面的龙门梯上监视裂纹是否扩大，如扩大，即告诉管油门的工人关闭油门，保证继续工作不出危险；机械组组长林英华随时检查机器，使它正常运转；这样在各种工人很好配合的联合劳动下，当天下午就把最后四根桩木全部打好。在收工的时候，孙亦譞很感动地说：“许多工人联合想出来的好办法，我一个人想一个月也想不出来！”他并认识到：“工作组同志深入工人中去，不是为了搜集我的缺点，发动工人来斗争我，而是帮助我改正缺点，完成生产任务。”他就更主动地找工作组同志了。他自己思想转变后，又去影响四个领工员，说服他们要依靠工人。四月九日，大桥工程较原计划提前十一天完成。
    但涪江桥工区，却是另一种情况。
    涪江桥共有十八个桥墩、十九孔，全长三百七十一公尺。原定一九五二年十一月十五日开工，由于准备工作未做好，到十二月四日才正式开工。因设计文件迟，二月二十日以前搞明挖，二月二十日才由明挖转到下开口沉箱，集中十四台抽水机下十四号桥墩的沉箱。三月份十一号、十三号、十五号、十六号桥墩沉箱工作相继开工，但由于工人提出的重视防水的合理化建议被工区领导方面挡了回去，他们光想依靠上级多发抽水机，结果工程进行得很迟缓，浪费了大量的汽油。如下十六号桥墩的沉箱时，集中十三台抽水机也抽不干，工区的领导干部强调抽水机不足。工人们纷纷提议：“再进行一次围砌工作吧！”工区代理副主任唐士福说：“这能解决什么问题？”结果浪费了很多汽油，最后还是进行了围砌工作，才把十六号沉箱的水很快抽干了。由于领导干部不依靠工人阶级，不能及时解决工人中存在的问题，自一月到四月，桥工区的施工计划全部落空。第一季度计划挖基一万四千四百六十一方，只完成一万方，计划打水泥六百六十三方，只完成四百五十一方。四月份计划要把十一号、十二号、十三号、十五号、十六号桥墩的五个沉箱全部落成，结果只完成了十五号、十六号两个沉箱，直到距洪水期仅有几天，工程仍处在危险阶段。涪江桥工区工作组来到工地后，没有能及时挽救这个危险。他们与生产脱节地搞政治工作，工作组长曾一连二十五天没有下山，住在高高的山坡上领导工区政治学习，每天忙于听汇报，把正在与洪水赛跑的艰巨的大桥工程中存在的工区领导问题和如何完成生产任务等重大问题搁在一旁。当延误了施工的良好时机，人工地造成了五十九部抽水机和洪水作斗争的紧张局面时，工作组领导干部还不结合生产发动群众，而把工作组与工区原有的党和青年团的力量全部用来搞政治学习。距洪水期仅有几天了，十四号桥墩的沉箱还淹没在水里，水泥还未打成，十二号桥墩还在集中抽水机下沉箱。在大桥附近的江水上，一层黄色的汽油在水面上漂流。工人们很沉痛地说：“这是啥子领导，这是在把我们国家的人民币往水里倒呀！”
    石亭江大桥和涪江大桥是两个多么明显的例子！它再次教育我们：在企业中，一切人员都必须面向生产，必须依靠工人阶级！
