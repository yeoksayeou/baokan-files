The people of the world are now happy about the Korean armistice, but the warmongers in the United States are showing an extremely helpless and awkward appearance. On the day before the armistice agreement was signed, Holles, vice president and Far East director of the Associated Press, who claimed to be a "longtime friend" of Syngman Rhee, made the absurd statement in a dispatch as usual: "The exhausted (American) negotiators today are willing to agree that the Korean armistice talks have given a profound lesson: if you want to end a war quickly, you have to win the war. The Second World War was not so troublesome. At that time, one side won, and the conditions for signing the armistice agreement were stipulated by the victor." This precisely reflects the helpless mood of the American warmongers who failed to set fire and burned themselves instead.

The initiators of the Korean War should have learned enough lessons from the three years of war.

They should flip through the newspapers of three years ago and think about their original arrogance and stupidity. Here is a dispatch from Washington on July 1, 1950, by the Associated Press under Holles: "Authoritative sources here say: They foresee the situation in Korea as similar to the situation in Greece in 1947. ...It will take weeks or months to occupy Korea." What a "prediction" from an authoritative source. This was still an estimate after the American troops participated in the war and suffered several defeats. So, how did they estimate it when they started the war? Look at the report from a reporter of the American "New York Herald Tribune": "Many American officers and soldiers originally thought that as long as the United States took action, the North Korean army would collapse immediately. Now they know that this is not so easy. ...The fact that the American army could not win a few battles at the beginning has discredited the American army. The war, which was originally thought to be low-cost, must now be dragged on for several months."

It's more than just dragging on for "several months"! One year, two years, more than three years have passed! The "war that was originally thought to be low-cost" has cost the United States about 400,000 troops and 20 billion US dollars in military spending, but the "few victories" they were hoping for have never appeared. Associated Press reporter Lambert had to admit: "We underestimated the North Koreans, which is admitted by both ordinary soldiers and generals alike, and will continue to be admitted in the future."

Although they admit that they "underestimated the North Koreans," they have not learned a lesson. They still refuse to admit that they "overestimated themselves." They thought that relying on the prestige of their paper tiger, they could still use intimidation and blackmail to obtain something that could not be seized by force. During the more than two years of armistice negotiations, people were tired of hearing the various shouts of American representatives and their generals and politicians inside and outside the meeting. Among them, the loudest was "military pressure," such as "air and sea superiority," "amphibious landing," "bombing China," "using atomic weapons"... All kinds of blackmail methods were exhausted, but what they couldn't get, they still couldn't get.

Until a few days before the negotiations were about to reach an agreement, Holles and his like still wanted to use a rumor to carry out false intimidation in order to cover up the embarrassing situation of the American negotiators. On July 17, this rumor-mongering expert said that the American negotiators had put forward a "final memorandum," and also said that it was a "final ultimatum." But what kind of stuff the "final ultimatum" is, Holles has not yet explained to his "readers." But in the few days before and after Holles fabricated the rumor, people read many "excellent" dispatches from American journalists as the "finale" of this three-year war: "Today, along the twenty-mile front of barren mountains... the largest battle in the Korean War in the past two years is taking place. The Chinese army is breaking through the South Korean lines by defeating one South Korean division after another, forcing four South Korean divisions to retreat along the Kim Sung salient in the eastern part of the central line" (Associated Press, 15th). "For thirty-six hours, South Korean soldiers, tanks, artillery and jeeps struggled to retreat south on roads made muddy by two days of heavy rain. (Among the retreating South Korean troops were also some American artillery and tanks). If the Chinese Communists had taken action at that time, they might have reached the Hwacheon Lake - the site of an important hydroelectric power plant many miles to the south. ...They would have been able to turn this several-mile stretch of road into a river of blood" (Associated Press, 21st). They should be thankful that the Chinese and Korean People's Armies did not take action to pursue them to Hwacheon Lake for the sake of the armistice.

At this moment, the American representative sat down in Panmunjom and signed the armistice agreement. However, it is not certain whether the warmongers who are accustomed to seizing profits from the bloodshed of others without shedding their own blood have really learned a lesson. They are already helpless at the moment. However, they are still the instigators and supporters of the Syngman Rhee group, which is preparing to take a breather and launch another war. Therefore, the peace-loving people of the world must increase their vigilance against them a hundredfold.

    我们还必须警惕
    李高
    全世界人民现在都为朝鲜停战而高兴，但美国的好战分子却显出了一副万分无可奈何的尴尬相。停战协定签字的前一天，美国合众社副社长兼远东分社社长、自称是李承晚的“多年挚友”的霍布雷奇特在一则电讯中照例荒谬绝伦地说：“疲惫不堪的（美国）谈判代表们今天都愿意同意朝鲜停战谈判给人深刻的教训：如果你要爽快地结束一场战争，你得打赢这场战争。第二次世界大战时，就不像这样麻烦。那时，有一方得胜，签订停战协定的条件就由战胜国来规定。”这恰恰反映了美国好战分子们放火不成反烧了手的那种无可奈何的心情。
    朝鲜战争的发动者本来应该是从三年的战争中得到足够的教训的。
    他们应该翻一翻三年前的报纸，想一想自己当初的狂妄和愚蠢。这里是霍布雷奇特手下的合众社在一九五○年七月一日从华盛顿发的一条电讯：“此间权威人士称：他们预见朝鲜情势和一九四七年希腊的情势相像。……要几个星期或几个月才能占领朝鲜。”好一个权威人士的“预见”，这还是在美国军队参战吃了几次败仗以后的估计，那么挑起战争时他们是怎样估计的呢？看看美国“纽约论坛报”记者的报道：“美国许多官兵，原先以为只要美国一动手，北朝鲜的军队便会立刻崩溃的。现在知道这并不是那样容易的事了。……美军不能一开始便打几场胜仗，已经使得美军威信扫地。原先以为代价很低的战争，现在必须拖至好几个月了。”
    岂止拖“好几个月”！一年，两年，三年多过去了！“原先以为代价很低的战争”，已经叫美国损失了约四十万兵员，花掉了两百亿美元军费，而他们所盼的“几场胜仗”却始终没有出现。美联社记者兰伯特不得不承认：“我们过低估计了北朝鲜人，这是不论大兵和将军都同样承认了，今后还会承认的。”
    他们虽然承认“过低估计了北朝鲜人”，但他们却没有得到教训，他们还不肯承认“过高估计了自己”。他们以为凭借自己的纸老虎威风，还可以用恫吓和讹诈取得一笔用武力所占取不了的东西。两年多的停战谈判过程中，人们听厌了美国代表和他们的将军、政客们在会内会外的各种叫嚣。其中叫得最响的就是“军事压力”，什么“海空优势”、“两栖登陆”、“轰炸中国”、“使用原子武器”……各色各样的讹诈手段都使尽了，但得不到的东西还是得不到。
    直到谈判快要达成协议的前几天，霍布雷奇特之流为了掩饰美国谈判代表的狼狈不堪的境地，还想用一个谣言来进行虚声恫吓。七月十七日，这个造谣专家说：美国谈判代表提出了一个什么
    “最后备忘录”，又说是一个什么“最后通牒”。但“最后通牒”究竟是个什么样的货色，霍布雷奇特至今还没有向他的“读者”交代。但就在霍布雷奇特造谣的前后几天，人们却读到了美国新闻记者们许多写得相当“出色”的电讯，作为这个三年战争的“尾声”：“今天沿着二十英里的荒山的前线……进行着两年来朝鲜战争中最大的一场战斗，中国军把南朝鲜军一师又一师地击溃而冲入南朝鲜阵线，迫使韩国四个师沿着中线东部金城突出地带后撤”（美联社十五日电）。“有三十六个小时的时间，韩国兵士、坦克、大炮和吉普车在被两天的大雨弄得泥泞不堪的公路上拚命往南退却。（在退却的韩军中间还夹杂一些美军的大炮和坦克）。要是中国共军那时采取行动的话，他们可能已经到达了华川湖——在南面许多英里的一个重要水力发电厂所在地。……他们就能够把公路上的这个长达数英里的地段变成一条血河”（美联社二十一日电）。他们真应该庆幸，因为中朝人民军队为了停战而没有采取追到华川湖的行动。
    就在这个时候，美国代表在板门店坐了下来在停战协定上签了字。可是，习惯于从别人的流血中攫取利润而又不必流自己身上的血的好战分子是否真的接受了教训也还未必。他们在目前是已经无可奈何了。但是，他们仍然是准备喘息一下再度发动战争的李承晚集团的煽动者和支持者。因此全世界的和平人民要百倍地提高对他们的警惕。
