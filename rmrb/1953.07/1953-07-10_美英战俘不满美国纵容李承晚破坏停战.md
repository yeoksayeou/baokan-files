(Xinhua News Agency, Bitong, 9th) American and British prisoners of war (POWs) detained in North Korea have, in the past two weeks, expressed increasing anger in numerous small gatherings and in letters and recordings to relatives and friends back home regarding Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the POW agreement with the tacit approval of the United States.

	A British POW named Borden said, "Syngman Rhee must be replaced to ensure a satisfactory solution to the Korean problem." An American POW of Mexican descent, Navarro, said, "Syngman Rhee wants war. Some of the things we say about him here can't be written down. The brothers here hope he dies soon."

	Another American POW of Mexican descent, Moreno, said, "Syngman Rhee is under the control of the United States. The Americans are responsible for the ‘release’ of the POWs. The Americans control all the other forces participating in the Korean War, and the Americans have the power to prevent Syngman Rhee's actions beforehand, and if they wanted to, they could order him to immediately hand over all the ‘released’ POWs." American POW Douglas expressed the same opinion, saying, "If the United States is sincere about the negotiations, it would be easy for them to recapture the ‘released’ POWs, because everyone knows that Syngman Rhee's army, navy, and air force are all under the control of the Allied Forces Command."

	Philippine POW Fajardo said, "The POW agreement was signed by the Americans, and they have a responsibility to ensure that the agreement is implemented."

	POW Barnhart said in a recording to his friends in the United States, "I originally thought I might get home in time for a few summer men's gatherings, but now I don't know what to think. As I see it, the United Nations Command should keep the South Korean government under good control, otherwise, the Korean peace talks here may be interrupted again. If what they want is not an interruption of the negotiations, then they are making fun of what millions of people consider most important. Most of us in this camp have been captured for more than two and a half years, and have been away from home for at least three years. We feel that the United Nations Command should now follow the wishes of the peace-loving people of the world and end the Korean War in a way that is satisfactory to all parties concerned."

	Puerto Rican POW Mendez said, "A few days ago, we were only a few miles from home, and now we are thousands of miles away again! You know, we all want to beat Syngman Rhee up. Without the support of the United States, he is nothing. I also think everyone will make a strong protest about what is happening. Now it is up to Washington to solve this problem."

	AP photographer Noel, who was captured, has been unable to sleep for several nights because his plan to spend a two-month "second honeymoon" with his wife is being postponed indefinitely. He said, "Without outside support, Syngman Rhee cannot do these things on his own. I guess he will be assassinated. I know he lived in the United States for about thirty years, and he doesn't love the South Korean people. He has no prestige among the people, and he relies entirely on force for support."

	POW Trevino said, "Syngman Rhee is not from South Korea, but from the United States… All his arms are made in the United States. Without American aid, he cannot wage war at all."

	American-French POW Brossard said, "Syngman Rhee boasts about 'marching to the Yalu River,' he is crazy to say that. Even the United Nations forces don't have that much strength, they have been fighting for three years, but now they are still stuck on the 38th parallel." British POW Williams continued, "It's easy for Syngman Rhee to say 'march to the Yalu River'; but if he really did that, he would be here with us POWs."

### 美英战俘不满美国纵容李承晚破坏停战

    美英战俘不满美国纵容李承晚破坏停战
    【新华社碧潼九日电】拘留在北朝鲜的美、英战俘，在以往两个星期中，在许多小型的集会上和给家乡亲友的信件与录音片中，对于李承晚在美国默许下破坏战俘协议一事，愈来愈表示愤怒。
    一个名叫勃登的英国战俘说：“必须撤换李承晚，以便保证朝鲜问题的满意解决。”一个美籍墨西哥战俘纳伐罗说：“李承晚要战争。我们在这里骂他的一些话，是写也写不出来的。这里的弟兄们希望他早些死掉。”
    另一个美籍墨西哥战俘莫里诺这样说：“李承晚是在美国控制之下的。美国人要对‘释放’战俘负责任。美国人控制了参加朝鲜战争的所有其他部队，美国人有力量事先制止李承晚的行动，并且只要他们愿意的话，他们可以命令他立即把一切‘释放了’的战俘交出来。”美国战俘道格拉斯表示了同样的意见，他说：“如果美国对谈判怀有诚意的话，他们要把‘释放了’的战俘抓回来，那是很容易的，因为每个人都知道，李承晚的陆海空军都是在联军司令部的控制之下的。”
    菲律宾战俘法雅多说：“战俘协议是美国人签订的，他们有责任使这个协议得到实施。”
    战俘班哈特在给他在美国的朋友们的录音片中说：“我起先认为我或许可能及时回家，赶上几个夏季男人聚会，但是我现在不知该如何想才好了。据我看，联合国军司令部应该好好地控制住南朝鲜政府，否则的话，这里的朝鲜和平谈判可能再度被打断。如果他们所希望的不是谈判中断，那末他们是在把千百万人民认为最重要的事情拿来开玩笑了。我们这个营房里的大多数人都被俘了两年半以上，离家起码已有三年。我们觉得联合国军司令部现在应该遵从世界爱好和平的人民的愿望，使朝鲜战争得以在有关各方面都认为满意的情况下结束。”
    波多黎各战俘孟德兹说：“几天前我们离家只有几英里，现在又是几千英里了！你知道，我们都想痛打李承晚一顿。如果没有美国的支持，他便算不了什么。我还认为每一个人都将对正在发生的事情提出强硬的抗议。现在要由华盛顿来负责解决这个问题了。”
    被俘的美联社摄影记者诺尔好几夜都睡不着觉，因为他的要和他的妻子过两个月的“第二次蜜月”的计划要无限期地延期了。他说，“如果没有外界的支持，光是李承晚自己是做不了这些事的。我猜他一定要遭暗杀。我知道他曾经在美国住了大约三十年，他并不爱南朝鲜人。他在人民中没有威望，他是全靠武力支持的。”
    战俘特里维诺说：“李承晚不是从南朝鲜来的而是从美国来的……所有他的军火都是美国造的。没有美国的援助，他根本无法进行战争。”
    美籍法国人布罗萨德说：“李承晚夸口要‘打到鸭绿江去’，他这么说简直是发疯。甚至联合国军都没有那么大的力量，他们已经打了三年仗了，可是现在他们仍然停留在三八线上。”英国战俘威廉斯接着说：“李承晚说说‘打到鸭绿江去’是容易的；但是如果他真的那么做了，他就要来这里和我们战俘在一起了。”
