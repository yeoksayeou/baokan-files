Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: North China region has achieved good results in improving rural leadership and clearing up the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas.

    Since the spring of this year, Party and government leading organs at all levels in the North China region have actively improved rural leadership and cleared up the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas. After studying documents and holding meetings for discussion, leading cadres at all levels have recognized the harm of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and decentralism. Therefore, when planning and arranging various tasks, they paid attention to distinguishing between priorities and making agricultural production the overriding center. At the same time, the working style of rural cadres in various places has also become more in-depth and practical than before. During the tense stage of drought resistance and sowing in Hebei Province, the vast majority of county and district cadres were able to devote themselves to leading production. In Handan County, thanks to the widespread presence of leaders at all levels in various districts and villages, leading farmers to check soil moisture, timely sowing was ensured, and the emergence rate of crops reached 80% to 90%. After appropriately controlling instructions, reports, and meetings in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, district cadres had more time to lead production; most of them were able to cooperate with village cadres to promote the general situation by cultivating typical examples. District cadres in Lucheng County's Third District helped farmers weigh seeds, measure land, and calculate the number of plants, effectively promoting the experience of close planting of millet. After carefully studying the working methods of the county, district, and village, Linhe County in Suiyuan Province unified the use of forces, overcoming the difficulties of having few and weak cadres, and improving the efficiency of cadres' work.

    Thanks to the proper arrangement of work by the higher-level leading organs in the North China region, rural grassroots cadres were able to free up time for production and further strengthen leadership over production. Before the clearing up of the "five excesses" phenomenon, the village head of Haojia Village in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, only spent one and a half days on his own production in three months; after the clearing up, he was able to engage in his own production for eighteen days in twenty days and lead the farmers in the village to study production issues. Cadres in Yinghaizhuang Village in the suburbs of Beijing used to be busy and chaotic and did not care about their own family production, but now they all have time to go to the fields for production. The village head of Yinghaizhuang said: "With order in work, things are easier to handle."

    The change in the leadership style of county and district cadres in the North China region, coupled with the correction of the rash and biased tendencies in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, has resulted in a new atmosphere of "simplified administration and diligent people" in many regions. Statistics from seventy-seven villages in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, show that 961 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have revised their production plans, expanded production investment, and actively participated in patriotic production competitions, completing spring plowing and sowing in a timely manner. In the past month, farmers in eighteen villages in four counties including Xiyang and Pingshun have added seventy head of livestock. Farmers in seventeen villages in Huguan and Huairen counties have added 128 pieces of agricultural implements, both large and small. With the increase in farmers' production enthusiasm, the primary market has also become active. Livestock transactions were the most numerous at the material exchange meeting in Chengguan, Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province.

    At present, Party and government leading organs at all levels in the North China region are further strengthening leadership over rural work, changing the situation in which some cadres are timid and production is left to flow freely, as well as the phenomenon in some areas where production is excessively emphasized as the overriding center, weakening and canceling departmental work.

    华北农村清理“五多”现象后加强领导生产
    不少地区出现“政简民勤”新气象
    【新华社四日讯】华北地区改进农村领导工作，清理农村“五多”现象，已得到较好的成绩。
    今春以来，华北地区各级党、政领导机关积极改进农村领导工作，清理农村“五多”现象。各级领导干部经过学习文件和开会讨论，认识了主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义的危害。因此，他们在计划、安排各项工作时，注意了分别轻重缓急，做到使农业生产为压倒一切的中心。同时，各地农村干部的工作作风也普遍较前深入踏实了。河北省在抗旱播种的紧张阶段，绝大部分县、区干部都能全力领导生产。邯郸县由于各级领导干部普遍深入各区、村，领导农民查墒验墒，保证了及时播种，并使作物出苗率达百分之八、九十。山西省临汾县对指示、表报和会议作了适当控制后，区干部就有较充裕的时间领导生产；他们大多能配合村干部以培养典型的方法，推动一般。潞城县第三区区干部帮助农民称量种籽，丈量土地，计算株数，有效地推广了谷子的密植经验。绥远省临河县仔细地研究县、区、村的工作方法后，统一使用力量，克服了干部少和弱的困难，并提高了干部的工作效率。
    华北地区由于上级领导机关妥善安排工作，使农村基层干部得以腾出时间进行生产，并进一步加强了对生产的领导。山西省武乡县郝家庄村长，在清理农村“五多”现象前，三个月内只有一天半进行自己的生产；清理后，二十天内就有十八天能够自己生产，并领导全村农民研究生产问题。北京市郊区瀛海庄村的干部过去工作忙乱，顾不得自己家里的生产，现在已都有时间下地生产。瀛海庄的村长说：“工作有了秩序，事情也好办了。”
    华北地区县、区干部领导作风的转变，加之互助合作运动中的冒进偏向得到纠正，不少地区都出现了“政简民勤”的新气象。山西省屯留县七十七个村统计，有九百六十一个农业生产合作社、互助组重新修订了生产计划，扩大了生产投资，并积极参加爱国生产竞赛，及时完成了春耕播种。昔阳、平顺等四县十八个村农民近一月来增添牲畜七十头。壶关、怀仁两县十七个村农民增置大小农具一百二十八件。随着农民生产情绪的提高，初级市场也活跃起来。山西省沁源县城关的物资交流会上，以牲畜成交为最多。
    现在，华北地区各级党、政领导机关正进一步加强对农村的领导工作，改变部分干部束手束脚，使生产陷于自流，以及部分地区过分强调以生产为压倒一切的中心而削弱和取消部门工作的现象。
