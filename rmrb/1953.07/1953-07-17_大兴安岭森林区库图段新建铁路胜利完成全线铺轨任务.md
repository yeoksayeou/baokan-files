The new railway section from Kutu to Turihé in the Greater Khingan Forest Area, which began construction on June 1, 1952, successfully completed the arduous task of laying tracks to Turihé three days ahead of schedule on June 27th this year.

The starting point of the Kutu section railway construction, Kutu’er, is the terminal station of the Ya'lin Line, located on the edge of the Sanhe Forestry Area. In order to develop the virgin forests of the Sanhe area to support the country's large-scale economic construction, under the direct guidance of the Central People's Government, the Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Administration began developing the Turihé Forestry Area, a corner of the Sanhe Forestry Area, in June last year. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government also decided at the same time to build a new railway from Kutu’er to Turihé (the confluence of the Turihé and Xiniqi River).

The construction of the Kutu section railway began after relatively thorough and careful surveys. As early as October 1951, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, in cooperation with the Inner Mongolia Forestry Bureau, jointly organized a survey team to survey the route of the Kutu section railway, initially determining the line of the Kutu section. In March last year, another surveying team was organized to conduct a re-survey, correcting a portion of the line. In order to achieve the requirements of being both good and economical, in mid-April last year, Comrade Wu Zongpeng, the director of the Kutu Section Engineering Office, personally led the office's engineers to conduct a final review, correcting all lines that could be improved, and finally determining the line that has now completed the track-laying task. Compared to the first determined line, it reduced more than 500,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work and a considerable number of bridge and culvert projects, saving more than 20 billion yuan compared to the construction cost estimated in the first survey.

The construction of the Kutu section railway began on June 1, 1952. The railway is 70 kilometers long and was constructed by the 10th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. A large number of railway construction workers and engineering technicians were drawn from all over the country to participate in the railway construction project. The project was carried out in two stages. First, the 39 kilometers between Kutu’er and Lingding were built. During the construction of this section, the military workers of a certain unit of the railway engineering team completed most of the engineering tasks, laying the tracks to 39 kilometers (from Kutu’er) in November last year and starting temporary operations. After November last year, winter construction continued, and construction of the Lingding to Turihé section began. By June 27th this year, the task of laying the tracks to Turihé had been completed ahead of schedule.

The construction area of ​​the Kutu section railway is in the forest, and it has to pass through many swampy areas. The mountain peaks blocking the roadbed must be chiseled open, and the valleys must be filled. Thanks to the efforts of the railway construction engineers, they overcame the above-mentioned difficulties and conquered the severe cold of the Greater Khingan Mountains. During the construction, the railway construction workers frequently put forward challenges and responses, launched patriotic labor competitions, and created many new railway construction and stone transportation tools such as aerial cable baskets.

The rapid success of the construction of this railway is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. Shortly after the start of construction, Soviet experts Troianov and Kaplanov personally inspected the engineering situation in the Kutu section construction area, pointed out methods for construction in permafrost areas, corrected errors in construction, and introduced the advanced experience of socialist Soviet Union in conducting winter construction when building railways, ensuring the smooth progress of the project and increasing the confidence of the railway construction engineers in carrying out winter construction. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Kutu section engineers carried out the first winter construction operation in the history of Chinese railway construction, shortening the project schedule. In thirteen months, the Kutu section engineers gloriously completed the arduous task of laying tracks to Turihé.

    大兴安岭森林区库图段新建铁路胜利完成全线铺轨任务
    去年六月一日开始施工的库都尔至图里河段新建铁路，已在今年六月二十七日提前三天完成了铺轨到图里河的艰巨任务。
    库图段筑路工程的起点库都尔，是牙林线的终点车站，位于三河林区的边缘。为了开发三河地区原始森林，以支援祖国大规模经济建设，在中央人民政府的直接指导下，去年六月，由内蒙古森林工业管理局着手开发三河林区一角的图里河林区。中央人民政府铁道部也同时决定在库都尔至图里河（图里河和西尼气河汇合点）修筑一条新铁路。
    库图段铁路的修建，是经过比较周密和慎重的勘测之后才开始施工的。早在一九五一年十月，中央人民政府铁道部配合内蒙古林务总局，曾共同组织勘测队，进行了库图段铁路路线的勘测，初步确定了库图段的线路。在去年三月，又组织了测量队进行复测，修正了一部分线路。为了达到又好、又省的要求，在去年四月中旬，库图段工程处处长吴宗鹏同志又亲自领导该处工程师进行了最后一次复查，把可以改得更好的线路全行更正，最后确定了现在已经完成铺轨任务的线路。比第一次确定的线路减少了五十余万土石方和不少桥涵工程，比第一次测定施工所需费用节省了二百余亿元。
    库图段筑路工程于去年六月一日开始施工。这条铁路共长七十公里，由中央人民政府铁道部第十工程局负责施工，并从全国各地抽调出大批筑路员工、工程技术人员参加筑路工程。工程共分两段进行，首先修筑了库都尔至岭顶间的三十九公里。在修筑这一段的工程中，铁路工程队某部的军工同志们完成了大部分的工程任务，在去年十一月就将路轨铺到三十九公里（自库都尔起），并开始了临时营业。去年十一月以后，又继续进行冬季施工，着手修筑岭顶至图里河段。到今年六月二十七日已经提前完成了铺轨至图里河的任务。
    库图段铁路的施工地区，是在森林里，要经过不少泥沼地带，要把挡住路基的山峰凿开，要把山谷填平。由于筑路工程人员的努力，克服了上述困难，战胜了大兴安岭的严寒，在施工中，筑路员工们经常提出挑战、应战，展开爱国主义劳动竞赛，并且创造了空中飞篮等很多新的筑路运石工具。
    这条铁路的迅速建筑成功，是和苏联专家的帮助分不开的。在施工开始不久，苏联专家特洛扬诺夫和卡普兰诺夫两位同志曾亲身到库图段工区巡视了工程情况，指给了在永久冻层地带施工的办法，纠正了施工中的错误，并且介绍了社会主义苏联在修筑铁路时进行冬季施工的先进经验，保证了工程的顺利进行，并且提高了筑路工程人员进行冬季施工的信心。在苏联专家的指导下，库图段工程人员进行了中国筑路史上的第一次冬季施工作业，缩短了工程日程。在十三个月的时间内，库图段工程人员光荣地完成了铺轨到图里河的艰巨任务。
