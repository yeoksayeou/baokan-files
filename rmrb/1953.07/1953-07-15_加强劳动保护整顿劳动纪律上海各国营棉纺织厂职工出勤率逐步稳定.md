To strengthen labor protection, rectify labor discipline, and Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories gradually stabilize employee attendance rates.

[Our Newspaper] The East China Textile Administration convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the administration and labor unions of Shanghai's textile factories, as well as labor protection and hygiene work cadres from each factory, on June 11th. The meeting arranged to strengthen and improve factory labor protection work, to ensure workers' safety and health, to rectify labor discipline, and to increase attendance rates. After the meeting, each factory implemented effective measures. State-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory paid attention to strengthening labor protection work, reducing workers' labor intensity, and constructing cold air equipment. To care for mothers nursing their babies and to reduce the workload of pregnant female workers, the state-owned No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory selected a certain number of female workers in each workshop to act as substitute workers. Trade union organizations in various factories universally strengthened education on consolidating labor discipline among workers. Many factory employees launched criticism and self-criticism in discussions about implementing production plans. Workers who observed labor discipline were universally respected.

The editorial department of Shanghai's Liberation Daily invited advanced workers from seven Shanghai state-owned cotton textile factories on June 16th to discuss and exchange experiences in strengthening labor discipline, in order to promote this work. On June 26th, the newspaper featured the model of consciously observing labor discipline, Hua Yanying, a female worker at the state-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, on its front page. Since the liberation of Shanghai four years prior, she had not been absent for a single day, had never been late or left early, and had received the highest attendance award from the administration every year.

In June, attendance rates at most of Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories gradually stabilized. Among the city's nineteen state-owned cotton textile factories, twelve factories saw attendance rates improve compared to May. The absentee rate at the state-owned No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory decreased from 11.01% in May to 8.37%. The state-owned No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory, which previously had a very high absentee rate, saw its absentee rate decrease from 30.83% in May to around 20% in June.

    【本报讯】华东纺织管理局在六月十一日召开了上海各纺织厂行政、工会负责干部和各厂劳动保护、卫生工作干部会议，布置加强和改进工厂的劳动保护工作，保障工人的安全和健康，整顿劳动纪律，提高出勤率。会后各厂都进行了有效措施，国营上海第六棉纺织厂注意了加强劳动保护工作，减轻工人劳动强度，修建了冷风设备。国营第七棉纺织厂为了照顾妈妈喂奶和减轻怀孕女工的工作负担，每个车间都选择一定数量的女工作代替工。各厂的工会组织普遍在工人中加强了巩固劳动纪律的教育。不少厂的职工在讨论贯彻生产计划中展开了批评与自我批评。遵守劳动纪律的工人普遍受到尊敬。
    上海解放日报编辑部，为了推动这个工作，在六月十六日，邀请了七个上海国营棉纺织厂的先进工人，座谈和交流了加强劳动纪律的经验。六月二十六日该报以头条地位，介绍了自觉遵守劳动纪律的模范、国营上海第六棉纺织厂女工华雁英的事迹。她从上海解放四年来，没有缺过一天勤，没有迟到早退过，每年都得到行政上最高的考勤奖。
