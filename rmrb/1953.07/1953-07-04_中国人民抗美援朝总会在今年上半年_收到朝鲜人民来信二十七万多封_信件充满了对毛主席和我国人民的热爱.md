Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea received more than 270,000 letters from the Korean people to the Chinese people in the first half of 1953. These letters came from the Korean People's Army troops at the front lines in Korea and from factories, schools, and rural areas in the rear. Some were addressed to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, some to Chinese workers, farmers, youth, women, students, and Young Pioneers, and many to the mothers of martyrs such as Luo Shengjiao, a first-class model of cherishing the people in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and special-class meritorious service winner, and Yang Gensi, a special-class hero. These letters were written on silk fabrics and silk paper, and decorated with various patterns. Some letters also contained souvenirs. One Korean People's Army soldier, whose parents were both killed by American planes, sent a part from an American plane shot down to the Chinese mother as a souvenir. These letters are full of the Korean people's love and respect for the leader of the Chinese people, as well as their heartfelt gratitude and deep friendship for the Chinese people. A Korean old woman in her sixties vividly described in a letter to Chinese women how she lovingly put the cold hands of the Volunteer Army comrades into her bosom and got up every night in the cold winter nights to cover the Volunteer Army soldiers living in her home with quilts. She said: "You sent your dearest husbands and sons to Korea. This selfless assistance is something we will never forget for generations to come." A Korean People's Army soldier said in a letter: "We deeply thank you for your assistance in all aspects. The blood shed by the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people on the Korean battlefield will forever shine in Korean history."

The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea wrote a letter on June 30th on behalf of the Chinese people to the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China to be forwarded to the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, expressing gratitude for the letters from the Korean people. The letter stated: "These enthusiastic letters we have received fully demonstrate the deep friendship of the Korean people towards our people, and will further consolidate the fighting unity of our two peoples against aggression." The committee has also forwarded these letters to people from all walks of life and the recipients.

    中国人民抗美援朝总会在今年上半年
    收到朝鲜人民来信二十七万多封
    信件充满了对毛主席和我国人民的热爱
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会在一九五三年上半年内收到朝鲜人民寄给中国人民的信件二十七万多封。这些信件来自朝鲜前线的朝鲜人民军部队和后方的工厂、学校、农村，其中有的寄给中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席，有的是寄给中国的工人、农民、青年、妇女、学生和少年先锋队员们，也有不少信件寄给中国人民志愿军一级爱民模范、特等功臣罗盛教和特级英雄杨根思等烈士们的母亲。这些信件，有用丝织品写的，有用绢纸写的，上面还饰有各色花纹。有的信件还装了一些纪念品，一个父母都被美国飞机炸死的朝鲜人民军战士把打下的一架美国飞机上的零件寄给中国的母亲作为纪念。这些信件充满着朝鲜人民对中国人民领袖的热爱和尊敬，以及他们对中国人民的衷心感激和深厚的友谊。一个六十多岁的朝鲜老大娘在给中国妇女的信中，生动地叙述了她是怎样慈爱地把志愿军同志冰冷的双手揣进她底怀里，在寒冷的冬夜里每晚起来为居住在她家里的志愿军战士们盖被子。她说：“你们派遣了自己最亲爱的丈夫和儿子来到朝鲜，这种无私的援助是我们千秋万代不能忘记的。”一个朝鲜人民军战士在信上说：“我们深深感谢你们各方面的援助。中国人民优秀的儿女在朝鲜战场上流出的鲜血，将在朝鲜历史上永远放射光芒。”
    中国人民抗美援朝总会已于六月三十日代表中国人民写信给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使馆转朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，对朝鲜人民的来信表示感谢。信中写道：“我们所收到的这些热情的信件，充分表现了朝鲜人民对我国人民的深厚友谊，它将更进一步地巩固我们两国人民反抗侵略的战斗团结。”该会并分别把这些信件转交到各界人民和受信者手中。
