Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, July 14th: The cooperative movement in the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is developing steadily. From the Hulunbuir Grassland in the northern border of Inner Mongolia to the pastoral areas of Xilin Gol and Chahar Leagues in the west, 57,000 Mongolian, Solon, and other ethnic herders have become members of cooperatives. Currently, more than 60 fixed or mobile supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in various leagues and banners, with continuously increasing share capital and expanding business operations.

The development of supply and marketing cooperatives in pastoral areas has greatly promoted the exchange of goods and improved the lives of various ethnic groups. The Hulunbuir League's pastoral area cooperative has purchased livestock (cattle and sheep) and wool worth a total of 26.2 billion yuan for state-owned trading companies over the past four years, powerfully supporting agricultural production and the needs of cities and industries. In the past two years, cooperatives in various banners of the Xilin Gol League organized Mongolian herders to collect cashmere, increasing their income by the equivalent of 56,000 sheep. Due to adhering to the principles of equivalent exchange and promoting production, cooperatives in various regions have raised the prices of livestock products to reasonable levels. In the past, herders could only exchange one brick of tea for a sheep when trading with unscrupulous merchants, but now they can exchange six or seven bricks of tea.

In addition to supplying various ethnic herders with a large amount of daily necessities, production tools, and marketing various livestock products, cooperatives in various leagues and banners have recently begun to run small-scale industries to meet the needs of herders. Cooperatives in the four pastoral banners of Hulunbuir League have all established milk processing plants, and some banner cooperatives are gradually establishing felt boot, leather making, and woodworking factories. The Hailar City Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union, in addition to already establishing a small food factory, has recently organized a group of handicraft workers to establish a shoe and boot production cooperative. This production cooperative will produce six to seven thousand pairs of men's and women's riding boots favored by herders this year.

    内蒙古自治区牧区合作事业稳步向前发展
    【新华社归绥十四日电】内蒙古自治区牧区的合作事业正在稳步发展中。从内蒙古北部边疆的呼伦贝尔草原到西部的锡林郭勒、察哈尔盟牧区，已有五万七千名蒙古、索伦等族牧民成为合作社的社员。现在，各盟旗已经建立了六十多个固定的或流动的供销合作社，股金不断增加，业务日益发展。
    牧区供销合作社的发展，大大促进了物资交流，改善了各族人民的生活。呼纳盟牧区合作社，成立四年来为国营贸易公司收购了总值二百六十二亿元的牲畜（牛、羊）和羊毛，有力地支持了农业生产和城市、工业的需要。锡林郭勒盟各旗合作社最近两年内组织蒙族牧民抓山羊绒，使他们增加了相等于五万六千只羊的收入。各地合作社由于坚持了等价交换、发展生产的方针，使畜产品已经提高到合理的价格。从前牧民和不法商人交易，一只羊只能换一块砖茶，如今能换六、七块砖茶了。
    各盟旗合作社除大量供应各族牧民所需要的生活消费品、生产工具和推销各种畜产品外，为满足牧民需要，最近还开始举办小型工业。呼纳盟四个牧业旗的合作社都已开办了牛奶加工厂，有的旗社正在逐步设立毡靴、制革、木工等工厂。海拉尔市供销合作社联合社，除已设立小型食品工厂，最近还组织了一批手工业工人，成立鞋靴生产合作社，这个生产合作社，今年将生产六、七千双男女牧民喜爱的马靴。
