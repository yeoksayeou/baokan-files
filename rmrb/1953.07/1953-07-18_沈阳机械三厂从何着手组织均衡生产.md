How Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 3 Organized Balanced Production
Song Zheng

Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as Factory No. 3) was originally a factory with a relatively good working foundation. In the New Record Creation Movement in Northeast China in 1949 and the subsequent movements to improve quality and establish responsibility systems, Factory No. 3 achieved excellent results. The workers had a strong sense of completing the plan. The factory's objective conditions were also not bad. Although there were often temporary emergency tasks, the production tasks were relatively simple and fixed, and the batches put into production each time were also relatively large. Compared with those machine tool factories with unfixed and small-batch production tasks, the planning and organization work here was relatively easy to carry out.

However, one problem often troubled the employees of Factory No. 3: no matter which month it was, the production situation was always relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end. To complete the task, they had to rely on a spurt. The spurt production disrupted the entire enterprise's production order, making it impossible for various innovations and improvements to show comprehensive and consolidated results here. By the first quarter of 1951, the situation of spurt production had become even more serious. In the first quarter, the employees used their highest enthusiasm to complete a batch of emergency tasks without sufficient preparation, exceeding the usual norms. This "major spurt" greatly depleted Factory No. 3's vitality, and after that, even with more spurts, they could not complete the tasks, and sometimes not even one machine tool could be produced in one or two months. Calculating the equipment capacity and the labor productivity of the workers, the task should have been able to be overfulfilled. However, the workers' working hours and equipment capacity were wasted on downtime waiting for materials.

The leading cadres and employees of Factory No. 3 could no longer tolerate this situation continuing to exist, and everyone urgently demanded to change the status quo!

However, where to start to reverse this chaotic situation?

The chaotic phenomenon of spurt production like that of Machine Tool Factory No. 3 was common in machine tool factories at that time. After the Northeast Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement began in 1951, the Machinery Industry Administration Bureau of the former Northeast Industrial Department proposed at a meeting that each factory should manage production with instruction charts to make production proceed rhythmically. At the same time, the former Northeast Industrial Department issued instructions to strengthen workshop work. In October, the Chinese translation of "Organizing Rhythmic Work According to Instruction Charts" by the Soviet Yuliev was published. The leading cadres of Factory No. 3 also organized all the factory's cadres to study in a planned and led manner. Under the supervision and guidance of higher-level leading organs, they earnestly improved their management work based on advanced Soviet experience.

How can we achieve rhythmic production according to instruction charts? A complex factory is like an orchestra. If production is to proceed rhythmically, we first need a score—an operation plan—that can specifically guide the production activities of each workshop, each section, each work section, each group, and even each worker every day or even every hour. At the same time, we need to train and organize each unit and each person to accurately and strictly implement this plan. Factory No. 3 did not have such an operation plan in the past. To change the chaotic situation, we must start from here to organize the entire factory's production activities. Therefore, Factory No. 3 carried out many necessary reforms and preparations according to its specific situation and the needs of compiling and executing operation plans.

First, it improved the workshop organization and initially clarified the responsibilities of the sections most closely related to organizing balanced production. Originally, Factory No. 3 was directly led by the production section. This not only prevented the workshops from solving problems independently and made them dependent on the production section in everything, but also the problems in workshop production often involved other sections. The production section neither understood the situation of other sections nor guided their work, so the problems often had to be taken to the factory director to be solved. According to the requirements of organizing balanced production, Factory No. 3 strengthened the workshop work and at the same time separated the workshops from the production section and put them directly under the leadership of the factory director. Both the Machinery Industry Bureau and Factory No. 3 organized work groups to first go to the most complex and chaotic processing workshop to clear the cadres' minds, help them analyze and understand the problems in the workshop work, help improve the workshop organization, transfer technicians to establish planning groups responsible for workshop operation plans, strengthen original records and statistics work, and set up technical security officers and mechanics. Tool rooms and material warehouses were also established for the workshops. In addition to the scheduling organization that the workshops already had, the workshops were no longer in the state of incomplete organization, unclear responsibilities, and many problems being no one's responsibility in the past. After the workshops were directly under the leadership of the factory director, the problems that occurred in production were also solved more promptly.

At the same time, Factory No. 3 also divided the scope of responsibilities of the production section and the planning section. Originally, both the production section and the planning section were in charge of the monthly plan, and there were often unclear responsibilities when problems occurred in production. At this time, Factory No. 3 determined that the planning section was only responsible for the annual and quarterly plans. The production section issued monthly plan targets based on the quarterly plan and grasped the entire factory's production scheduling work to ensure the realization of the monthly plan.

To compile an operation plan, it is also necessary to solve a problem in a machine tool factory: accurately calculate the production cycle and various turnover volumes. The management cadres of Factory No. 3 neither knew how long it took to produce a machine tool from the raw materials entering the factory, sand casting, forging, parts processing to final assembly, nor how much process occupation and reserve volume was needed to make production run normally. Without understanding these, it was impossible to comprehensively plan the entire factory's production. According to the instructions in the book "Organizing Rhythmic Work According to Instruction Charts," Factory No. 3 calculated the time required to produce a lathe in reverse order (that is, step by step from the needs of the assembly workshop), and at the same time calculated the process occupation and flow reserve volume according to the production cycle and cycle period of each part. This calculation greatly clarified the cadres' minds. In the past, plans were made at the end of this month, and they wanted to produce lathes next month. At this time, they realized that if they wanted to produce lathes this month, various raw materials had to reach the processing workshop two months ago, and the required materials had to be prepared one quarter in advance. Understanding this process provided a basis for compiling an operation plan.

Before compiling the operation plan, Factory No. 3 also took advantage of the production stop during holidays to thoroughly inventory the raw materials in the warehouse and the work-in-process and semi-finished products in the workshop. Without this number, there was no way to decide how to stipulate tasks for workshops and sections in the current month. In the past, Factory No. 3 had also continuously carried out inventory. However, in the past, it was always chaotic while inventorying. While this side was investigating, the other side was constantly putting raw materials into production and constantly assembling parts into machine tools, and the parts in progress were constantly flowing between processes. It was like chickens running around the yard, and it was impossible to count the number. After this inventory, Factory No. 3 made detailed charts of raw materials, parts, and those that had been partially assembled according to the needs of each unit, so that people could see at a glance which things were still disproportionate, and they should be balanced when making plans to avoid backlog and downtime waiting for materials in the future.

After carrying out certain reforms and preparations, Factory No. 3 focused on compiling the operation plan.

The operation plan was initially compiled by the production section, and the plan and progress of raw material collection, parts collection, partial assembly, and product assembly were grasped through charts. The production section and the factory's leading cadres initially had a clear understanding of the production situation, and the management work was also more proactive. However, the plan only stayed in the production section. Cadres below the work section chief and the workers could not grasp the plan, and the accuracy of the plan and the realization of the plan were greatly limited. Immediately afterwards, Factory No. 3 started to make an operation plan from the secondary processing workshop where the work group was located. The workshop planner took the original time quotas given by the production section and gave them to experienced workers to discuss and revise, specifically assigned the tasks to each work section, group, individual, and each machine tool, arranged the processes, and stipulated the daily progress. After the plan was discussed by the masses, various rationalization proposals of the masses were also organized into it. The workshop and work section schedulers checked the completion of the plan every day according to the progress stipulated in the operation plan and fought against various phenomena that hindered the realization of the plan to ensure the realization of the plan.

The operation plan can start from a main workshop, but it cannot only stay in one workshop. Without rhythm in the production of the entire factory, the rhythm of production in one workshop must be disrupted. After the processing workshop had an operation plan, other workshops in Factory No. 3, as well as the material supply and tool manufacturing departments, also began to compile monthly operation plans and establish charts one after another. The production section finally reviewed and revised the operation plans of each workshop and section to make them connect and cooperate with each other, and then handed them over to each unit for execution. The activities of the entire factory began to be organized according to the needs of production.

With an operation plan, it is easy to draw an instruction chart, make the operation plan into a chart form, use a blue line to indicate the planned progress, and draw a red line every day to indicate the actual completed progress. By comparing the red and blue lines, the production situation can be seen at a glance. In this way, not only the factory director and the production section, but even each work section chief, group leader, and each worker can know the problems in their production and even the impact it will have. The supply and marketing section also makes a separate signal chart for the parts that have not completed the progress, and uses different colors such as red, yellow, and white to mark the urgency of these problems and the date of resolution, so that it does not affect workshop production.

Having an operation plan in each link does not immediately mean that the production task can be completed balancedly on a daily basis. There is still a considerable distance in between. This distance requires the unremitting efforts of all the factory's employees to shorten it.

Although the initial operation plan of Factory No. 3 could not effectively control the workshop's production activities, it could continuously expose the problems in production by checking the implementation situation every week and every month. Not long after the operation plan started, problems such as poor preparation work before production, weak section work, tools not keeping up with the workshop's production needs, inaccurate material consumption quotas affecting material preparation work, material quality not meeting the requirements, poor warehouse management, random taking of low-quality materials to pretend to be replacements, and unreasonable workshop production organization affecting the compilation and execution of the plan were successively revealed. It is also easy to grasp which part of the production force is prominent and which part has become a weak link. The problems of the operation plan itself were also gradually discovered. From here, everyone can solve these problems step by step with different priorities and urgency, and can gradually eliminate the chaotic phenomenon of spurt production and downtime waiting for materials from the root. At this time, those employees who did not believe that the operation plan and instruction charts could solve the problems also became interested, and the mass base of the operation plan was slowly consolidated.

In a machine tool factory, to complete the task balancedly, there must be a normal occupation volume between processes. There are normal flow reserves and certain insurance reserves in the parts warehouse. When Factory No. 3 started to organize balanced production, it consciously adopted the method of increasing the strength of the processing workshop to accumulate the reserve volume little by little, so that the balanced production had a certain material guarantee. When the entire factory had an operation plan, the trade union launched a red flag competition, encouraging workers to ensure the completion of the daily progress.

After many efforts, by April 1952, the commodity balance rate of the entire factory had reached 70%, and the state plan had been overfulfilled by 10%. By the winter of 1952, the commodity balance rate continued to increase to about 90%, and the state plan could basically be completed on a daily basis.

However, the balance rate within each workshop of Factory No. 3 is still not high enough. The problem is that the preparation work before production still cannot keep up with the needs of the workshop, the organization and leadership work in the execution of the plan is not strong enough, and the original records are not accurate enough. At present, Factory No. 3 is further strengthening plan management and consolidating balanced production, and these problems should be solved in a timely manner.

    沈阳机械三厂从何着手组织均衡生产
    宋琤
    沈阳机械三厂（以下简称三厂）原来是一个工作基础相当好的工厂。在一九四九年东北创造新纪录运动以及以后的提高质量、建立责任制等运动中，三厂都做出了很好的成绩。工人们完成计划的观念很强。工厂的客观条件也不坏，虽然常有临时紧急任务，但生产任务比较单一、固定，每次投入生产的批量也较大，比起那些生产任务不固定的小批生产的机械厂来，这里的计划和组织工作都比较容易进行。
    但是，有一个问题常常苦恼着三厂的职工：不管那个月，生产情况总是前松后紧，要完成任务就得依靠突击，突击生产打乱了整个企业的生产秩序，使各种革新改进在这里都不能表现出全面的巩固的效果。到了一九五一年第一季，突击生产的情况更为严重了。第一季，职工们用最高的热情超越常规地突击完成了一批没有充分准备的紧急任务。这次“大突击”弄得三厂元气大伤，以后再突击也完不成任务了，甚至一两个月出不来一台机床。算算设备能力和工人的劳动生产率，任务应该是能够超额完成的。可是工人的工时和设备能力都被浪费在停工待料上面了。
    三厂的领导干部和职工群众再也不能容忍这种情况继续存在下去，大家迫切地要求改变现状！
    但是，从何着手来扭转这混乱局面呢？
    像机械三厂的这样突击生产的混乱现象在当时的机械厂中是普遍存在的。一九五一年东北增产节约运动开始后，原东北工业部机械工业管理局在一次会议上提出要各厂用指示图表管理生产，使生产有节奏地进行。同时，原东北工业部发出了加强车间工作的指示。十月中，苏联尤力也夫著的“按指示图表组织有节奏的工作”一书的中译本出版了。三厂的领导干部又有领导有计划地组织全厂干部学习。在上级领导机关的督促和指导下，他们认真地根据苏联先进经验来改进自己的管理工作。
    怎样才能做到按指示图表有节奏地生产呢？一个复杂的工厂也像一个乐队一样，要想生产进行得有节奏，首先需要一个能够具体指导每个车间、每个科股、每个工段、每个小组以至每个工人的每天乃至每小时的生产活动的乐谱——作业计划，同时训练并组织每个单位每个人都能准确地严格地执行这个计划。三厂过去是没有这样的作业计划的。要改变混乱状况必须从这里开始来组织全厂的生产活动。于是，三厂根据自己的具体情况，根据编制和执行作业计划的需要，进行了许多必要的改革和准备。
    首先健全了车间组织并初步划清和组织均衡生产关系最为密切的科室的职责。原来，三厂是由生产科直接领导车间。这样，不但使车间不能独立解决问题，处处依赖生产科；同时，车间生产中的问题，常常牵扯到其他科股。生产科既不了解其他科股情况，又不指导他们的工作，问题便常常要吵到厂长那里才能解决。三厂根据组织均衡生产的要求，加强了车间工作，同时使车间脱离生产科，直接归厂长领导。机械工业局和三厂都组织了工作组，首先到最为复杂最为混乱的加工车间，打通干部们的思想，帮助他们分析认识车间工作中的问题，帮助健全了车间组织，抽调了技术员来建立了负责车间作业计划的计划组，加强了原始记录和统计工作，设立了技术保安员和机械员，还为车间建立了工具室和材料库。加上原来车间已有的调度组织，车间已不是过去那种机构不健全、职责不清、许多问题无人负责的状况了。车间直接受厂长领导后，生产中发生的问题解决得也比较及时。
    与此同时，三厂还划分了生产科和计划科的职责范围。原来，生产科和计划科都管月度计划，生产有了问题常常两方面扯不清。这时，三厂确定计划科只负责年度和季度计划。生产科根据季度计划下月计划指标，掌握全厂的生产调度工作，以保证月计划的实现。
    要编制作业计划，在机械厂还需要解决一个问题：准确地计算生产周期和各种周转量。三厂的管理干部们既不知道生产一台机床从原材料进厂、翻砂、锻造、零件加工以至最后装配出来究竟需要多少时间，也不知道有多少工序占用量和储备量才能使生产正常进行。不懂得这些，就没法通盘计划全厂的生产。三厂根据“按指示图表组织有节奏工作”一书的指示，按照反顺序（即从装配车间的需要一步一步的向前推算）计算出生产一台车床所需要的时间，同时根据每种零件的生产周期和循环期计算出工序占用量和流动储备量。这一计算，大大地澄清了干部们的思想。过去，这月底做计划，下月就想出车床。这时才知道要想这月出车床，两个月前，各种原材料就得到达加工车间，所需材料在一季前就得准备好。懂得了这个过程，编制作业计划就有了根据。
    在编制作业计划之前，三厂还趁假日生产活动停止时，彻底地清点了仓库的原材料和车间的在制品半制品等。没有这个数目字，就没办法决定当月如何给车间、科股规定任务。过去，三厂也曾不断进行清点。但是，过去总是一边清一边乱，这边在清查，那边又不断把原材料投入生产，不断把部件装成车床，在制的零件又不断地在工序间流动，正像满院子乱跑的小鸡，怎么也数不清数目。经过这次清查，三厂把原材料、零件，和已经进行部分装配的都分别按台份需要做成明细的图表，使人一看就知道哪些东西还不成比例，做计划时应该把它们平衡起来，以免以后再一边积压一边停工待料。
    进行了一定的改革和准备以后，三厂就有重点地进行编制作业计划的工作。
    作业计划最初由生产科来编制，并且通过图表来掌握原材料搜集、零件搜集、部分装配和产品装配的计划与进度。生产科和厂里的领导干部对于生产情况的掌握初步做到心中有数，管理工作也比较主动了。但是，计划只停留在生产科，工段长以下干部和工人们不能掌握计划，计划的准确性和计划的实现都受到很大限制。紧接着，三厂就从工作组所在的二加工车间开始做作业计划。车间计划员根据生产科给的指标，把原来的工时定额拿来交给有经验的工人讨论修正，把任务具体地分配到各工段、小组、个人和每个机床上，排好工序、规定好每日的进度。这个计划经过群众讨论后，又把群众的各种合理化建议组织进去。车间和工段的调度人员就根据作业计划规定的进度，检查每天完成计划的情况，和各种阻碍计划实现的现象进行斗争，以保证计划的实现。
    作业计划可以从一个主要车间开始，但是不能只停留在一个车间。全厂的生产没有节奏，一个车间生产的节奏性一定要被破坏。加工车间有了作业计划后，三厂的其他车间以至材料供应和工具制造部门也都先后开始编制月度作业计划，建立图表。生产科把各车间、科股的作业计划最后再加以审查修正，使之互相衔接配合，而后交各单位执行。全厂的活动开始根据生产的需要组织起来了。
    有了作业计划，就容易绘制指示图表，把作业计划作成图表形式，用蓝线表示计划进度，每天划红线表示实际完成进度。红蓝线一对比，生产情况就可以一目了然。这样，不仅是厂长、生产科，甚至每个工段长、小组长和每个工人都可以知道自己生产中的问题，以至它将要发生的影响。供销科还把没有完成进度的部分，另外作一个信号表，用红黄白等不同颜色分别标志出这些问题的紧急程度和解决日期，使它不至影响车间生产。
    各个环节都有了作业计划，并不能立刻就均衡地按日完成生产任务。这中间还有一个相当的距离。这个距离需要全厂职工以不懈的努力来缩短它。
    三厂初期的作业计划虽然还不能有效地控制车间的生产活动，但是却能通过每周每月检查执行情况，不断暴露生产中的问题。作业计划开始不久，生产前的准备工作不好，科股工作薄弱，工具赶不上车间生产需要，材料消耗定额不准确，影响材料准备工作，材料质量不合要求，仓库管理不好，乱拿质量低劣的材料冒充顶替，车间生产组织不合理，影响计划的编制和执行等问题就先后显示出来。生产中那一部分力量突出了，那一部分成了薄弱环节，也都容易掌握。作业计划本身的问题也逐步被发现了。从这里，大家就可以分别轻重缓急有步骤地解决这些问题，就可以一步步地从根本上消除突击生产停工待料的混乱现象。这时候，那些不相信作业计划和指示图表可以解决问题的职工们也感到兴趣了，作业计划的群众基础慢慢地巩固了。
    在机械厂中，要均衡地完成任务，必须使工序间有正常的占用量。零件库中有正常的流动储备量，和一定的保险储备量。三厂在开始组织均衡生产时，就有意识地采取加大加工车间力量的办法，一点一点地积累储备量，使均衡生产有了一定的物质保证。在全厂都有作业计划时，工会发动群众展开了红旗竞赛，鼓动工人保证完成每天的进度。
    经过多方面的努力，到了一九五二年四月，全厂商品均衡率已达百分之七十，并且超额百分之十完成了国家计划。到了一九五二年冬，商品均衡率继续增高至百分之九十左右，基本上已经可以按天完成国家计划了。
    但是，三厂各车间内部的均衡率还不够高。问题在于生产前的准备工作仍然赶不上车间需要，执行计划中的组织领导工作还不够强，原始记录还不够准确。目前，三厂正在进一步加强计划管理，巩固均衡生产，这些问题应该得到及时解决。
