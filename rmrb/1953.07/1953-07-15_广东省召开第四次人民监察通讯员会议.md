The Guangdong Provincial People's Government Supervisory Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Second National Supervisory Work Conference, convened the Fourth People's Supervision Correspondents Meeting on June 25th this year to summarize and deploy the People's Supervision Correspondent work of the directly subordinate organs of Guangdong Province. Qu Mengjue, Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Supervisory Committee, delivered a summary report on the work of the People's Supervision Correspondents in the directly subordinate organs of the province at the meeting.

Since the second half of 1951, when the directly subordinate units of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government began to develop the work of People's Supervision Correspondents, there are now 306 correspondents in 63 units. Certain achievements have been made in the work. Many supervisory correspondents in various organs played an active role in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and in the current struggle against bureaucracy, they have also boldly exposed bad people and bad deeds. Many supervisory correspondents, in conjunction with their own work, have reflected problems existing in their work, thus helping leaders to improve their operations. For example, Wu Yuexuan, a supervisory correspondent from the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, discovered in his work that the flood diversion route of the Shilong Shitan Great Enclosure was incorrect and proposed changing the flood diversion route. This suggestion was approved by the leadership, resulting in the preservation of 300 lychee trees that were originally planned to be cut down and saving more than 200 million yuan in project costs for the state, taking care of the interests of the masses and saving state funds. In addition, considerable achievements have been made in exposing bureaucracy, violations of laws and regulations, reflecting the lives of the masses, and assisting administrative handling of people's letters and visits. Director Qu Mengjue pointed out in his summary that the reason why the People's Supervision Correspondence work has achieved success is due to: 1. People's Supervision Correspondents recognize the great significance of supervision work in national construction and the entire revolutionary cause, understand their tasks and responsibilities, have a high degree of work enthusiasm and responsibility, have a spirit of serving the people, hate bad people and bad deeds, can work automatically and consciously, do not care about personal gains or losses, are not afraid of retaliation, dare to boldly expose problems, and adhere to the truth, principles, and struggle. 2. Close contact with the masses, obtain the support of the broad masses, cultivate assistants, expand their ears and eyes, make supervision work a mass action, and rely on the masses to discover and solve problems. The reason they can do this is firstly because the list of supervisory correspondents is announced after they are selected, and their work can be carried out openly among the masses, gaining the consent and support of the masses. Secondly, they can often carry out propaganda work among the masses, improving the masses' understanding of supervision work. Finally, they actively support the opinions of the masses, and the problems reported by the masses are solved, gaining the trust of the masses. In short, it is because they have a mass viewpoint, can follow the mass line in their work, closely contact the masses, and rely on the strength of the masses to do their work well. 3. Combining business and combining the center. Many People's Supervision Correspondents can observe problems, discover problems, and promote leaders to improve their operations from their own business activities. Therefore, the work can be carried out smoothly. 4. Leadership support. On the one hand, leaders attach importance to the work of the People's Supervision Correspondents and can give them positive guidance and convenience in their work; on the other hand, the main reason is that the People's Supervision Correspondents can make achievements in their work, which has attracted the attention of the leaders and actively striven for the support of the leaders. For example, Wu Yuexuan, a People's Supervision Correspondent from the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, has played a role in actual work and can be an assistant to the leaders. Therefore, the responsible comrades of the bureau have ordered all departments to handle the problems reflected by the People's Supervision Correspondents quickly. In this way, the enthusiasm of the People's Supervision Correspondents has been improved, and they can play a greater role in their work.

The meeting pointed out that some People's Supervision Correspondents do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of the People's Supervision work, and therefore showed shortcomings such as a lack of responsibility, inability to contact the masses, and not actively doing supervision and correspondence work. Based on these circumstances, the meeting focused on solving the problem of understanding the importance of the People's Supervision Correspondence work, criticized the mercenary viewpoint that hindered supervision and correspondence work, the erroneous idea of personal gain and loss and not daring to adhere to principles, and the shortcomings of not contacting the masses and not actively seeking leadership assistance.

The meeting also corrected the thinking of the People's Supervision Correspondents and clarified their central tasks. In the past, many supervision correspondents were not clear enough about their central tasks. Some believed that the central task was only to supervise corruption and waste, while others only thought it was to supervise the democratic work style of leading cadres, etc. Therefore, they often lost their way in their work, causing confusion. At this meeting, it was determined that the main task of supervision work in the future is to supervise the correct implementation of national policies, laws, and construction plans, especially the correct implementation of economic construction plans, and to continue to fight against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and regulations. The supervision correspondents of various business departments should unify their steps under this general task and focus the center of supervision work on supervising the business of their own departments to ensure the completion of the business plans of various departments, thereby achieving the goal of ensuring the completion of the entire national construction plan.

    广东省召开第四次人民监察通讯员会议
    广东省人民政府监察委员会根据第二次全国监察工作会议精神，于今年六月二十五日召开了第四次人民监察通讯员会议，总结和布置了广东省直属机关的人民监察通讯工作。广东省人民政府监察委员会主任区梦觉在会上作了省直属机关人民监察通讯员工作的总结报告。
    广东省人民政府各直属单位于一九五一年下半年开始发展人民监察通讯员工作以来，目前在六十三个单位中已有通讯员三百零六名。在工作中已获得了一定的成绩。许多机关的监察通讯员在“三反”“五反”中曾起过积极的作用，在目前的反官僚主义斗争中也大胆地揭发了坏人坏事，有不少监察通讯员还结合自己的工作，反映了业务上存在的问题，因而帮助了领导改进了业务。如珠江水利局监察通讯员伍岳璇在工作中发现了石龙石滩大围分洪路线不正确，提出改变分洪路线的意见，取得领导的同意，结果保存了原来决定要砍除的三百枝荔枝树，并为国家节省工程费二亿多元，既照顾了群众利益，又节省了国家资金。此外，在揭发官僚主义、违法乱纪，反映群众生活，协助行政处理人民来信来访等方面也得到了不少成绩。区梦觉主任在总结中指出，人民监察通讯工作之所以能获得成绩的原因是由于：一、人民监察通讯员认识了监察工作在国家建设中和整个革命事业中的重大意义，明了自己的任务和职责。有高度的工作热情与责任心，有为人民服务的精神，能爱护人民利益，憎恨坏人坏事，能自动自觉地工作，不计较个人得失，不怕打击报复，敢大胆揭发问题，坚持真理，坚持原则，坚持斗争。二、密切联系群众，取得广大群众的支持，培养了助手，扩大了耳目，使监察工作变成了群众性的行动，依靠群众发现问题和解决问题。他们所以能够做到这点，首先是由于监察通讯员推选后把名单公布，他们的工作能公开在群众中进行，取得群众的同意与支持。其次是由于他们能经常在群众中进行宣传工作，提高了群众对监察工作的认识。最后是由于他们积极支持了群众的意见，群众揭发的问题得到了解决，取得了群众的信任。总之，是由于他们有群众观点，能在工作中走群众路线，与群众紧密联系，依靠群众力量做好工作。三、结合业务，结合中心。许多人民监察通讯员都能从自己的业务活动中观察问题，发现问题，并推动领导改进业务。因此，工作能顺利开展。四、领导方面的支持。一方面是领导人对人民监察通讯员工作较重视，能给予人民监察通讯员积极指导和工作上的方便；另方面，主要还是人民监察通讯员能在工作中做出成绩，引起了领导的重视，主动争取了领导的支持。如珠江水利局人民监察通讯员伍岳璇在实际工作中起了作用，能做领导的助手，因而，该局负责同志曾责成各部门凡人民监察通讯员反映的问题都应迅速处理。这样，就提高了人民监察通讯员的积极性，在工作中发挥更大的作用。
    会议中指出：还有部分人民监察通讯员对人民监察工作的重要性认识不够，因而表现了责任性不强，不能联系群众和不积极做监察通讯工作的缺点。根据这些情况，会议着重解决了关于人民监察通讯工作的重要性的认识问题，批判了妨碍监察通讯工作的雇佣观点、个人患得患失不敢坚持原则的错误思想和不联系群众不主动争取领导协助的缺点。
    会议还端正了人民监察通讯员的思想，明确了自己的中心任务。过去许多监察通讯员对自己的中心任务是不够明确的，有的认为中心任务仅仅是监督贪污、浪费，有的仅认为是监督领导干部的民主作风等等。因此，在工作中往往迷失方向，造成混乱现象。在这次会议上确定了今后监察工作的主要任务是监督国家政策、法令、建设计划的正确执行，特别是经济建设计划的正确执行为中心，继续与官僚主义、命令主义及违法乱纪现象作斗争。各个不同业务部门的监察通讯员，应在这一总的任务之下，统一步调，把监察工作的中心放在监督本部门的业务上，保证各部门业务计划的完成，从而达到保证整个国家建设计划完成的目的。
