Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch from London: The British Communist Party Political Committee issued a statement on the 23rd. The statement said: "Syngman Rhee's actions are a threat to peace and could lead to an expansion of the war in the Far East." The statement pointed out: "This American puppet, Syngman Rhee, would not survive a single day without the support, armaments, financial aid, and supplies from the United States." The statement said: "Syngman Rhee's loud clamoring for a fanciful 'sovereign independence' is obviously for ulterior motives, and the United States cannot escape responsibility for this. In June 1950, with the support of the United States, Syngman Rhee shouted 'March North' and launched the war. Now, he is obstructing the realization of peace for the same aggressive purposes as then." The statement concluded: "The secret deals between US representatives and Syngman Rhee must be exposed. The world has the right to know the truth. The United Nations General Assembly should be convened immediately to ensure peace in Korea and the Far East."
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th dispatch: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 21st entitled "Vigilance and Armistice," saying: "The news of progress in the Korean armistice negotiations is very gratifying." The editorial said: "We would have been even happier if the State Department had not adopted a 'cautiously optimistic attitude.' We remember several times when the armistice seemed about to be realized, the State Department also adopted this 'cautiously optimistic attitude.' And this kind of argument often leads to new delays." The editorial pointed out: "Strict adherence to the armistice terms and a sincere attitude at the political conference are necessary conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."
The editorial concluded: "During this period, the American people are best advised to remain vigilant, because unfortunately, as long as there are Dulles and McCarthy in Washington, and Syngman Rhee in Seoul, the possibility of provocative acts will always exist."
On the same day, the "Daily Worker" published the full text of General Nam Il's statement at the armistice talks on the 19th.

    英共政治委员会谴责美国纵容李承晚
    纽约“工人日报”号召美国人民保持警惕
    【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦消息：英国共产党政治委员会二十三日发表声明。声明说：“李承晚的行动是对和平的威胁，而且可能会促成远东战争的扩大。声明指出：李承晚这个美国傀儡如果不是得到了美国的支持、军火、财政援助和供应，那就连一天也活不下去。声明说：“李承晚大叫大嚷地要求空想的‘主权独立’实在别有用心，这是美国不能逃避责任的。一九五零年六月，李承晚在美国的支持下，高喊‘北进’，发动了战争，现在他又像那时一样，为了同样的侵略目的，而阻挠和平的实现。”声明最后说：“必须揭穿美国代表和李承晚之间的秘密交易。世界有权要求知道事情的真相。联合国大会应马上召开，以确保朝鲜和远东的和平。”
    【新华社柏林二十四日电】纽约“工人日报”二十一日以“警惕与停战”为题发表社论说：“朝鲜停战取得进展的消息，使人们感到非常高兴。”社论说：“如果国务院没有抱‘谨慎的乐观态度’的话，我们本来是会更加高兴的。我们还记得有好几次当停战似乎就要实现的时候，国务院也曾采取这种‘谨慎的乐观态度’。而这种论调往往带来新的拖延行动。”社论指出：“严格遵守停战条款和在政治会议上采取真诚的态度，是和平解决朝鲜问题的必要条件。”
    社论最后说：“在这一段时期内，美国人民最好是保持警惕，因为不幸得很，只要在华盛顿有杜勒斯和麦卡锡，在汉城有李承晚，那么发生挑衅行为的可能性就始终是存在着的。”
   “工人日报”在同一天刊载了南日大将十九日在停战谈判会议上的声明的全文。
