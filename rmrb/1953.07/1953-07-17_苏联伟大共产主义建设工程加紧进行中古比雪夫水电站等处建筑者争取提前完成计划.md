    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The construction of the Soviet Great Communist construction projects—the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station—continues. Construction workers are actively striving to complete the tasks stipulated by the national plan ahead of schedule.
    The builders of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station are intensifying their work. They are preparing to complete the plan eight months ahead of schedule to welcome the third anniversary on August 21st of the government's decision on the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. At the foot of Mount Mogutov—on the construction site of the power plant's foundation pit—engines roar day and night. Powerful excavators have dug the foundation pit more than twenty-five meters deep. In mid-June, many advanced workers, such as Borodin's excavator team, Myachev's team, and engineer Borisov, completed their tasks ahead of schedule. Now, large-scale concrete work is about to begin. Next to the foundation pit, an 800-meter-long trestle bridge spanning the entire foundation pit is being installed. Five gantry mobile cranes have been installed. On the lower revetment that bears the water flowing out of the turbines, 100,000 cubic meters of concrete work have been completed. At the Kazan Port construction site on the coast of the future artificial reservoir "Kuibyshev Sea," the steel sheet piles of the berthing place have stretched for more than two kilometers. Hundreds of metal piles have been driven into the ground. Dredgers have excavated and transported more than 400,000 cubic meters of soil from the port entrance and port. The reconstruction of the Kuibyshev Port has also begun. Several cargo terminals are being expanded on the upper breakwater. New railways are being laid here, and a batch of huge cranes and other machinery are being installed. Construction workers have piled tens of thousands of cubic meters of stones and sand on the breakwater. They guarantee to pile 50,000 cubic meters of soil on the breakwater over and above the plan by the end of this year.
    At the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station construction site on the Dnieper River, concrete has been poured into the lock chamber section for four months. Construction workers are launching a competition to complete tasks ahead of schedule. The construction of the overflow dam and power station is in full swing. The slopes and bottom of the foundation pit will be leveled. New roads to the foundation pit are being built. Construction workers guarantee to pour at least 450,000 cubic meters of concrete into the main hydroelectric power station building this year so that the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station can be completed ahead of schedule. On the right bank of the Dnieper River, preparations for using a particularly powerful dredger will be completed. This dredger will pile more than 2 million cubic meters of soil on the dam. In addition, a builder's city—New Kakhovka—is developing rapidly. Five hundred and fifty fully equipped houses, as well as medical institutions, shops, and kindergartens, have been built there. The construction of a cultural palace is nearing completion. Nearly 300,000 trees have been planted in parks, squares, and along streets.

    苏联伟大共产主义建设工程加紧进行中古比雪夫水电站等处建筑者争取提前完成计划
    【新华社十六日讯】  莫斯科消息：苏联伟大共产主义建设工程——古比雪夫水电站和卡霍夫卡水电站的建设工作继续进行。建筑工作者们积极争取提前完成国家计划所规定的任务。
    古比雪夫水电站的建筑者正在加紧工作。他们准备提前完成八个月的计划，来迎接八月二十一日政府颁布关于建筑古比雪夫水电站的决定的三周年纪念日。在摩古托夫山脚——电力厂基坑工地上，发动机日夜轰鸣。效力强大的挖泥机已把基坑挖了二十五公尺多深。六月中旬，许多先进工作者，如鲍罗金的挖掘机工作队、米亚切夫的工作队、工程师波里索夫等，都提前完成了自己的任务。现在，大规模混凝土工程即将展开。基坑旁边正在安装一座八百公尺长的横贯整个基坑的栈桥。五台高架移动起重机已经安装好了。在承受透平中流出的水的下护堤上，已完成了十万公方的混凝土工程。在未来的人工水库“古比雪夫海”海滨的喀山港工地上，泊船处的钢板桩伸展了两公里多长。几百根金属桩已打入地中。吸泥机已从入港处和港口中挖掘和运出了四十多万公方的泥土。古比雪夫港的改建工作也已开始了。在上防波堤上正在扩大几个运货码头。这里准备铺筑新铁路，安装一批巨大的起重机和其他机械。建筑工人已在防波堤上堆了几万公方的石头和砂子。他们保证到今年年底在防波堤上超计划堆土五万公方。
    在第聂伯河上卡霍夫卡水电站工地上，闸舱部分已经浇灌了四个月的混凝土。建筑工人正在展开提前完成任务的竞赛。建筑溢洪道大堤和电力站的工作正在全面展开。基坑的斜面和底面将要修平。到基坑去的新路正在修筑。建筑工人们保证在今年至少把四十五万公方的混凝土灌入主要的水电站建筑，以便能够提前使卡霍夫卡水电站落成。在第聂伯河右岸，使用一台效力特别强大的吸泥机的准备工作将要完成。这台吸泥机将把二百多万公方的泥土堆在堤坝上。此外，一个建筑者城——新卡霍夫卡——正在迅速地发展。五百五十所设备齐全的房屋以及医药机关、商店和幼儿园，已经在那里修建起来。有一个文化宫的建筑将要完成了。在公园、广场和街道两旁已经种上了将近三十万棵树。
