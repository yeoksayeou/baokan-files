Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 28th: General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, issued the following statement after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement:

    The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on July 27, 1953. All hostilities in Korea have completely ceased twelve hours after the signing of the agreement, and the Korean armistice, which the people of the world have longed for, has now been realized.

    Three years ago, the heroic Korean people, in order to defend their independence and freedom, bravely launched a glorious self-defense war to resist aggression and defend peace. For the past three years, the Korean people have resisted the United Nations forces headed by the United States with tremendous sacrifices, defending the land of their motherland. This war proves that an awakened, freedom-loving nation is invincible when it rises up to fight for the glory and independence of its motherland.

    Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Chinese people and the Chinese government have repeatedly put forward proposals and suggestions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the U.S. government disregarded the warnings of the Chinese people, ignored the peace aspirations of the people of the world, and stubbornly went its own way, not only occupying our Taiwan at the beginning of the Korean War, but also ordering its troops to cross the 38th parallel and attack the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on our northeastern border, posing a serious and direct threat to our security.

    Under these circumstances, in order to safeguard the security and peaceful construction of our motherland, to assist the just struggle of the Korean people, and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, the Chinese people resolutely carried out the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and formed their own volunteer forces—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army. After two years and nine months of heroic fighting, we not only repelled the enemy's invasion and stabilized the front line near the 38th parallel, but also launched many victorious counterattacks.

    The purpose of the anti-aggression war of the Korean and Chinese people was originally to strive for conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. Therefore, after the situation stabilized, the Korean and Chinese people and governments not only continued to propose a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but also fully accepted the peaceful proposal put forward by the Soviet government on June 23, 1951, regarding negotiations on a ceasefire and armistice, and began the Korean armistice negotiations with the United Nations forces on July 10, 1951. After two years of tortuous processes, the two sides finally reached a glorious agreement and signed the armistice agreement yesterday, thanks to the Korean and Chinese people's adherence to the policy of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the great efforts made by the peace-loving people of the world for the cause of peace.

    The most important issue at present is to strictly fulfill the obligations of the armistice agreement. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is willing to work with the Korean People's Army to ensure compliance with and fulfillment of all the provisions of the armistice agreement. However, the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world cannot but seriously note that some warmongers on the United Nations side, especially the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique, oppose the signing of the armistice agreement and have taken provocative actions to undermine the agreement even before it was signed. Therefore, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army will not forget the necessary vigilance and will fight resolutely with the utmost determination to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement.

    The armistice agreement now signed is of a military nature and is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The withdrawal of all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, from Korea, the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in the spirit of the Korean people handling their own affairs, and the establishment of a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent new Korea all remain to be negotiated at a higher-level political conference. The Chinese people have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, and the Chinese people are willing to be a strong backing for the peaceful resolution of international issues.

    Now, on behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, I pay tribute to the heroic Korean people and the

    彭德怀司令员发表谈话
    【新华社开城二十八日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在朝鲜停战协定签字后发表谈话如下：
    朝鲜停战协定已于一九五三年七月二十七日上午十时在板门店签字。自协定签字后十二小时起，在朝鲜的一切敌对行为已经完全停止，全世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战现在已经实现了。
    三年之前，英雄的朝鲜人民，为了捍卫自己的独立自由，英勇地展开了光荣的抵抗侵略、保卫和平的自卫战争。三年以来，朝鲜人民以巨大的牺牲，抗拒了以美国为首的联合国军，保卫了自己祖国的土地。这个战争证明，一个觉醒了的爱好自由的民族，当它为祖国的光荣和独立而奋起战斗的时候，是不可战胜的。
    自朝鲜战争爆发以来，中国人民和中国政府就再三提出和平解决朝鲜问题的主张和建议。但是，美国政府不顾中国人民的警告，无视世界人民的和平愿望，一意孤行，不仅在朝鲜战争爆发之初就侵占了我国台湾，而且命令它的军队越过了三八线，向我国东北边境的鸭绿江和图们江进攻，造成了对于我国安全的严重而直接的威胁。
    在这种情况下，中国人民为了保卫自己祖国的安全与和平建设，为了援助朝鲜人民的正义斗争，为了保卫远东及世界的和平，才毅然决然地进行了伟大的抗美援朝运动，组成了自己的志愿部队——中国人民志愿军，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。经过了两年零九个月的英勇战斗，我们不仅击退了敌人的进犯，稳定了三八线附近的战线，而且已经进行了多次的胜利的反击。
    朝中人民的反侵略战争，其目的原在于争取条件，使朝鲜问题得以在公平合理的基础上获致和平解决。所以，朝中人民和政府在战局稳定之后，不仅仍然继续提出以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的主张，而且完全接受一九五一年六月二十三日苏联政府所提出的关于谈判停火与休战的和平建议，于一九五
    一年七月十日与联合国军方面开始了朝鲜停战谈判。这个谈判经过了两年的迂回曲折的过程，由于朝中人民坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，由于世界爱好和平人民为了和平事业而作的巨大努力，谈判双方最后才达成了光荣协议，并在昨天签订了停战协定。
    当前最重要的问题是严格履行停战协定的义务。中国人民志愿军愿和朝鲜人民军一道，保证遵守并履行停战协定的一切规定。但是，朝中人民和世界人民不能不严重注意到联合国军方面还有一部分好战分子尤其是南朝鲜李承晚集团反对停战协定的签订，并且在协定签字之前已采取了破坏协定的挑衅行动。因此，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道将不会忘记应有的警惕，并将以最大的决心为保障停战协定的彻底实现而坚决奋斗。
    现在所签订的停战协定，是属军事性质的，还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。一切外国军队包括中国人民志愿军在内撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题在朝鲜人自己处理自己问题的精神下的和平解决，一个统一、民主、和平、独立的新朝鲜的建立，尚有待于高一级的政治会议去协商。中国人民是一贯主张以和平协商方式解决国际争端的，中国人民愿意为和平解决国际问题作坚强的后盾。
    现在，我代表中国人民志愿军向在金日成元帅领导下的英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军致敬。中国人民志愿军在朝作战的期间，受到了朝鲜人民衷心的爱护和热情的支援，这些爱护和支援使得我们两国人民和军队在同生死、共患难的高度国际主义精神之下，团结得更紧密了。祝我们两国人民在反侵略战斗中以鲜血结成的亲密友谊更加巩固和发展。
    现在，我代表中国人民志愿军向热烈支援前线的祖国同胞致谢。这些无限忠诚的物质的和精神的支援，大大地鼓舞了战士们的战斗意志，增强了我们的战斗力量。
    现在，我代表中国人民志愿军向以苏联为首的和平民主国家致敬。由于他们的屡次创议和不懈努力，朝鲜停战才终于实现。
    现在，我代表中国人民志愿军向全世界爱好和平的人民表示庆贺。显然，朝鲜停战的实现将促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，并有利于远东及世界的和平。任何好战分子，特别是南朝鲜李承晚集团如果敢于继续他们的破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶活动，他们的阴谋必将遭受世界爱好和平人民的坚强反对而归于可耻的失败。
    在抗美援朝战斗中光荣牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    和平胜利万岁！
