    Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: People's Democratic countries such as Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria are continuing to promote advanced Soviet experiences and have achieved remarkable results.
    In Poland, over 13,500 metallurgical workers are applying the work method of the advanced Soviet worker Zhandarova, and over 3,000 turners have adopted high-speed metal cutting methods. Forty-four metal processing factories have adopted Liga Kolabelnikova's comprehensive material-saving work experience. The renowned Kovalev work method has aroused great interest among Polish workers. Tens of thousands of workers and technicians in various industrial sectors are studying this work method. Many factories, such as the Stalin Machine Manufacturing Plant in Poznan and the Heavy-Duty Vehicle Factory in Starachowice, have even established training classes specifically for studying the Kovalev work method. Currently, over 13,000 workers in Polish cotton mills alone are studying the Kovalev work method. As a result of promoting the Kovalev work method, labor productivity in the cotton textile industry has increased by 11 percent, and labor productivity in the wool industry has increased by 12 percent. Recently, workers in factories such as the Warsaw Light Automobile Factory and the Waleski Factory, the Stalin Machine Manufacturing Plant in Poznan, and the Gdansk Shipyard have universally adopted Kolezov's powerful cutting method. After adopting new types of cutting tools, they frequently complete 1.5 to 2 quotas.
    In Romania, coal miners are promoting the advanced Soviet experience of one cycle per 24 hours of work according to instructed charts. Forty mining teams in the Jiu River basin have adopted this advanced work method. At the Lubeni No. 2 coal mine, the mining team led by Stakhanovite workers A. Ro and Dupe Shu Tojia, due to implementing this method, exceeded its production target by 2,000 tons of coal in May. In addition, Romanian construction workers are vigorously promoting the advanced work method of the Soviet construction worker Volov. Currently, there are over 360 bricklaying teams working using this method. Romanian agricultural workers are also paying attention to promoting advanced Soviet experiences. Currently, over 4,600 workers in state-owned farms are applying the farming methods of Soviet state-owned and collective farms.
    More and more workers in Bulgaria are learning from advanced Soviet work experiences. More than half of the workers at the National Parts Factory have become followers of Soviet innovators. Famous turners in the factory such as I. Verbanov, Bo. Panchev, and Ruo. Velkov, have been able to complete two to three quotas per day by adopting the Kolezov work method. The Red Star Machine Factory in Tyrnovo is also promoting powerful metal cutting methods. The advanced turner An. Panayotov, after mastering the advanced work method, frequently completes 700 to 750 percent of his task.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: According to TASS, Moscow: W. Klosewicz, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Poland, recently wrote an article in the Soviet "Pravda" discussing the struggle of the Polish people and government to build a new life.
    Klosewicz wrote that Poland has never been as strong as it is now, and the Polish working people have never been as united as they are today. Poland has never had such a constantly developing and growing industry as it does now. Poland is becoming an industrially developed and advanced country and is rapidly changing its face. In the past year alone, hundreds of medium and large new industrial enterprises have opened. National income has increased by one-tenth. Industrial output has tripled compared to pre-war levels. The income from socialist economic components accounts for three-quarters of the national income.
    The author pointed out that with the development of the national economy, the enthusiasm of the Polish working people is growing, and the socialist labor competition has become widespread. Last year, more than 75 percent of employees in state-owned industries participated in socialist competition. This year, more than 85 percent are participating, and workers in thousands of enterprises have put forward even greater production guarantees than in previous years. For example, workers at the Ursus Tractor Factory decided to manufacture 200 more tractors than planned this year using saved materials. The builders of the "Nowa Huta" metallurgical complex guaranteed to complete dozens of large production departments ahead of schedule. In conjunction with the labor competition, Polish workers are actively launching a rationalization proposal movement. Last year alone, they put forward 125,000 innovative proposals.
    Klosewicz emphasized that Poland's People's Government has consistently strived to improve the people's living standards. Concrete results can already be seen in the increase in food and manufactured goods consumption. Last year, sugar consumption per capita increased by one and a half times compared to pre-war levels, meat consumption almost doubled, wool fabrics doubled, and cotton fabrics increased by 63 percent compared to pre-war levels. The government allocated large amounts of funding for health services, labor protection, and for building sanatorium facilities and housing for the working people, as well as for training skilled workers. Last year, the state budget allocated 1,683 million zlotys for social and cultural undertakings. The government attaches great importance to the development of public health services. Last year, the number of health institutions was more than eleven times that of 1938. More than 111,000 new homes were built for the working people last year alone. Every year, Poland builds many kindergartens, nurseries, clubs, and cultural palaces, all of which are equipped with the latest facilities.
    Klosewicz pointed out that the average wages of employees in various departments have increased by 12 to 40 percent. Last year, the total wages paid were 185 percent of those in 1949. This year, the funds allocated for pensions and other social insurance benefits have increased by 46 percent. These measures have provided even more favorable conditions for further increasing industrial labor productivity, increasing agricultural production, and improving people's living standards.

    苏联“真理报”载文论述波兰建设的重大成就
    【新华社十九日讯】波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚等人民民主国家，继续推广苏联先进经验，取得显著成绩。
    在波兰，有一万三千五百多个冶金工人正在应用苏联先进工人让达罗娃的工作法，三千多个车工采用了高速金属切削法。四十四个金属加工工厂采用了丽佳·科拉别尔尼科娃的全面节省材料的工作经验。著名的郭瓦廖夫工作法引起了波兰工人的极大兴趣，各工业部门成千上万的工人、技术人员，都在学习这种工作法，许多工厂如波兹南的斯大林机器制造厂、斯塔拉霍维茨的载重汽车工厂等的生产车间，还专门成立了学习郭瓦廖夫工作法的训练班，目前单是波兰各棉织厂中学习郭瓦廖夫工作法的工作者就有一万三千多人。由于推广郭瓦廖夫工作法的结果，棉纺织工业的劳动生产率已提高百分之十一；羊毛工业的劳动生产率提高了百分之十二。最近，华沙的轻型汽车工厂和瓦勒斯基工厂，波兹南的斯大林机器制造厂、革但斯克的造船厂等工厂的工人们已普遍采用了科列索夫的强力切削法。他们采用新式车刀后，经常完成一个半到两个定额。
    在罗马尼亚，煤矿工人正在推广苏联的一昼夜一循环按指示图表工作的先进经验。久河流域煤矿有四十个矿工小组，采用了这种先进工作法。卢本尼二号煤矿，以斯大哈诺夫式工作者阿·罗和杜卑·殊·托佳为首的矿工小组，由于推行了这种方法，已在五月份超额生产了二千吨煤。此外，罗马尼亚的建筑工人还大力推广苏联建筑工人沃洛夫的先进工作法，现在利用这种方法进行工作的砌砖小组已有三百六十多个。罗马尼亚农业工作者也注意推广苏联先进经验，目前国营农场中就有四千六百多个工人，运用了苏联国营农场和集体农场的耕作法。
    保加利亚学习苏联先进工作经验的工人愈来愈多。单是国家零件工厂就已经有一半以上的工人成为苏联革新者的追随者，该厂著名车工伊·维尔邦诺夫、波·潘切夫、若·维尔科夫等，由于采用了科列索夫工作法，每天能完成两个到三个定额。第尔诺沃夫城的红星机器厂也在推广金属强力切削法，先进车工安·帕纳伊奥托夫，在掌握先进工作法后，经常完成任务百分之七百到七百五十。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：波兰工会中央理事会主席维·克沃谢维奇最近在苏联“真理报”上撰文，论述波兰人民和政府为建设新生活而斗争的情况。
    克沃谢维奇写道，波兰在以前从来没有像现在这样的强盛，波兰劳动人民在以前从来没有像今天这样的团结。波兰在过去从来没有像现在这样不断发展壮大的工业。波兰正在变成一个工业发达的先进国家，并且在迅速改变它的面貌。单在去年，就有几百个中等和巨型的新工业企业开了工。国民收入增加了十分之一。工业产量增为战前的三倍。在国民收入中，社会主义经济成分的收入占四分之三。
    作者指出：随着国家经济的发展，波兰劳动人民的积极性越来越大，社会主义劳动竞赛已经普遍展开。去年，国营工业中百分之七十五以上的职工参加了社会主义竞赛。今年参加竞赛的有百分之八十五以上，数千个企业的工人提出了比往年更大的生产保证。例如，乌尔苏斯拖拉机工厂的工人决定在今年要用节省下来的材料超计划多制造两百部拖拉机。“诺瓦—胡塔”冶金联合企业的建筑者保证提前建成几十个大生产部门。与劳动竞赛相结合，波兰工人积极展开合理化建议运动。单在去年，他们提出的革新建议就有十二万五千条。
    克沃谢维奇强调指出：波兰的人民政府始终不懈地为提高人民的生活水平而努力。从粮食和制成品消费量的增加中已经可以看出具体的结果。去年，按人口平均计算，糖的消费量增为战前的一倍半，肉类消费量差不多增为两倍，毛织品增为两倍，棉织品比战前增加了百分之六十三。政府拨出了大笔经费作为卫生事业、劳动保护、和为劳动人民建筑休养设备、建造住宅以及训练熟练工人之用。去年，国家预算中拨出了十六亿八千三百万兹罗提用于社会和文化事业方面。政府十分重视发展公共卫生事业。去年，卫生机构的数目已为一九三八年的十一倍多。单在去年为劳动人民建筑的新住宅就有十一万一千多间。每年，波兰修建许多幼儿园、托儿所、俱乐部和文化宫，这些机关都有最新式的设备。
    克沃谢维奇指出，各种不同部门职工的工资平均增加了百分之十二到百分之四十不等。去年，付出的工资总数为一九四九年的百分之一百八十五。今年，拨作养老金和其他社会保险津贴之用的款项增加了百分之四十六。这些措施又为进一步提高工业劳动生产率、增加农业生产和提高人民的生活水平提供了更多的有利条件。
