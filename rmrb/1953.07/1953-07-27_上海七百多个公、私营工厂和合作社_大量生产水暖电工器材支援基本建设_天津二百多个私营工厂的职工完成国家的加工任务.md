    Shanghai's 700+ Public and Private Factories and Cooperatives
    Mass-Produce Plumbing and Electrical Materials to Support Basic Construction
    Tianjin's 200+ Private Factories' Workers Complete National Processing Tasks
    Shanghai's over seven hundred public and private factories and cooperatives are producing large quantities of plumbing materials, electrical materials, tools and instruments, and various small hardware products to supply the needs of national basic construction. At least forty tons of these materials are shipped from Shanghai to all parts of the country every day. Among them, tools and instruments that must be used from the very beginning of basic construction, such as picks, shovels, steel hammers, angle rulers, inclinometers, and compasses, have been supplied in an amount of about one hundred tons in the first half of this year. Materials such as wires, electrical wire pipes, and plumbing fittings amounted to over three hundred tons shipped out in June. Small hardware products such as hinges, mortise locks, and window hooks also began to be supplied from mid-July.

    The production of these many factories and cooperatives is carried out under the unified organization of the Shanghai Branch of the China Hardware and Machinery Company and the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Communications Electrical Equipment Company. The production of these products is done to adapt as much as possible to the requirements of the various construction units, and special attention is paid to ensuring quality. For example, many construction units no longer like the porcelain and wooden electrical materials that were popular in the first half of the century, and require the supply of lightweight and beautiful bakelite products such as plugs and switches. Therefore, the thirty-odd private bakelite factories participating in the production are producing bakelite products in large quantities, with a monthly supply of about one million pieces. Many modern construction projects use electric welding instead of rivets for steel structures; after consultation, the relevant factories in Shanghai process and manufacture welding rods. The Longhua Production Cooperative alone can supply twenty tons of welding rods per month. Great importance is attached to the quality of various materials. For example, electric wires must all be made of electrolytic copper; copper valves (switches that control tap water or heating) are also all made of machine copper, not raw copper or mixed copper. After the wires are made, they must all undergo voltage and conductivity tests; after the copper valves are made, they must all undergo water pressure tests, and each one is engraved with the manufacturer's mark to show responsibility.

    With the start of national construction and the assistance of state-owned companies, the factories and enterprises in Shanghai that manufacture plumbing materials, electrical materials, and tools and instruments have developed considerably. For example, the number of factories manufacturing electrical wire pipes has increased from only three before liberation to thirty-two now, with a monthly output of 150,000 pieces. The number of factories manufacturing welding rods has increased from only two before liberation to eleven now, with a monthly output of 300 tons. Factories manufacturing electric wires, telephones, bakelite products, etc., have also developed similarly. Equipment such as pressure gauges, pyrometers, universal angle rulers, vernier calipers, small plane tables, compasses, meteorological instruments, lightning arresters, etc., which were not manufactured or rarely manufactured in the past, can now be produced in large quantities, and the quality generally meets the standards. For example, the electric display analytical balance manufactured by the Xinke Instrument Factory can accurately measure objects weighing one ten-thousandth of a gram (lighter than a hair); the thermocouple pyrometer manufactured by the Comprehensive Instrument Factory can measure temperatures up to 1,100 degrees Celsius. These two very precise new products have been well received after being supplied to newly built mines, factories, schools, and research institutions in Northeast China, North China, and other places. Among them, the electric display analytical balance was also exhibited at the "Exhibition of Industrial and Agricultural Achievements of the People's Republic of China" held in Moscow.

    The broad masses of workers in more than two hundred private machinery, wrought iron, cast iron, welding and plating, and model factories in Tianjin are actively supporting national basic construction and have successively completed the national processing tasks for the first half of the year.

    The more than two hundred factories processed more than one hundred kinds of parts in the first half of the year. Except for machines such as cranes and mud mixers, most of them were drilling tools such as drill bits and tubular drill bits. These parts were all things that the workers had not done before, but they demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, actively sought tricks and tapped potential, and successfully completed this production task. Workers at factories such as Tiantaixiang and Guangxing came up with a method of burying semi-finished products in lime to soften them, overcoming the difficulty of the raw materials being too hard when making plywood; Fan Xigui, an old technician at the Sentai factory, changed from single-handed welding to double-handed welding, overcoming the problem of sand holes being prone to appear when welding drill bits, ensuring product quality, and increasing the daily output from thirteen drill bits to thirty. Workers at the Defaxing factory adopted a multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method to turn drill bits, which saved man-hours and improved quality. When making the baffle of the seat pulley, the workers of the Xinbeihua factory changed the blanking method, so that one iron plate could only produce one baffle, but now it can produce three.

    The workers of each factory also often supervise the capitalists to make them carry out production in accordance with the provisions of the contract. For example, when the capitalist of the Zhisheng factory undertook to make core tubes, he welded a section onto it because the length was insufficient; the capitalist of the Sentai factory added iron rods to the welding of drill bits. These violations of the contract were exposed and corrected by the workers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海七百多个公、私营工厂和合作社
    大量生产水暖电工器材支援基本建设
    天津二百多个私营工厂的职工完成国家的加工任务
    上海市七百多个公、私营工厂和合作社生产大量的水暖器材、电工器材、工具仪器和各种小五金产品，供应国家基本建设的需要。这些器材每天至少有四十吨从上海运往全国各地。其中像镐、铁锹、钢郎头和角度尺、倾斜仪、罗盘仪等基本建设一开始就必须使用的工具仪器，今年上半年，已供应了约一百吨；电线、电线铁管和水管配件等器材，六月份运出了三百多吨；铰链、力锁、窗勾等小五金产品，也从七月中旬起开始供应。
    这许多工厂和合作社的生产，是在中国五金机械公司上海分公司和中国交通电工器材公司上海采购供应站的统一组织下进行的。这些产品的生产都尽量地适应各建设单位的要求，并特别注意保证质量。如插扑、开关等电工器材，许多建设单位已不喜欢前半个世纪流行的瓷质品和木质品，要求供应轻巧美观的胶木制品。因此，参加生产的三十几个私营胶木厂，都大批生产胶木制品，每月的供应数量约有一百万个。很多现代化建设工程的钢铁结构，已不用铆钉而用电焊；上海各有关工厂经过协商后，就加工制造电焊条，仅龙华生产合作社一家，每月就可供应电焊条二十吨。各种器材的质量都很被重视。比如电线，全部都要用电解铜做；铜阀（控制自来水或暖气的开关）也都全部用机器铜做，不用生铜和杂铜。电线制成后，要全部经过电压和导电率试验，铜阀制成后也全部做水压试验，每一只都刻上制造厂的记号，以示负责。
    随着国家建设的开始和国营公司的扶助，上海市制造水暖器材、电工器材和工具仪器的工厂企业有着相当的发展。如制造电线铁管的工厂，解放前只有三家，现在发展到三十二家，月产量达到十五万枝。制造电焊条的工厂，解放前只有两家，现在发展到十一家，月产量达到三百吨。制造电线、电话机和胶木制品等等的工厂也同样有了发展。过去没有制造过或很少制造过的压力表、火表、万能角度尺、游标卡尺、小平板仪、罗盘仪、气象仪器、避雷器等等器材，现在也已能大量生产，而且质量一般都合乎标准。如新科仪器厂制造的电示分析天平，能准确地衡量万分之一公分重（比一根头发还轻）的物体；综合仪器厂制造的热电偶高温计，能度量温度到摄氏一千一百度。这两种十分精密的新产品供应给东北、华北等地新建矿山、工厂、学校和研究机关后，很受赞誉。其中电示分析天平并在莫斯科举行的“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”上展出。（新华社）
    天津市二百多个私营机器、锻铁、铸铁、焊镀、模型等工厂的广大职工，积极支援国家基本建设，接连完成了上半年的国家加工任务。
    这二百多个工厂上半年接受加工的机件有一百多种，其中除起重机、泥浆搅拌机等机器外，大部分是钻粒钻头、筒状钻头等钻探用具。这些机件都是工人们过去没有做过的，但是他们发挥了高度爱国热情，积极找窍门、挖潜力，胜利地完成了这项生产任务。天泰祥、广兴等工厂的职工想出把半成品埋在白灰里变软的办法，克服了做夹板时原料太硬的困难；森泰工厂老技术工人范喜桂改变单手烧焊为双手烧焊，克服了烧焊钻头时容易出砂眼的毛病，保证了产品质量，并把日产量由十三个钻头提高到三十个。德发兴工厂的工人采用多刀多刃切削法来车钻头，既节省了工时又提高了质量。新北华工厂的工人在做座滑车的档板时，改变下料方法，原来一张铁板只能出一块档板，现在增加到出三块。
    各厂职工还经常监督资方，使他们按照合同规定来进行生产。如芝生工厂的资方在承做岩芯管时，接手长度不够，就用电焊焊上一段；森泰工厂的资方在焊制钻头中加上铁棍，这些违犯合同的行为，都被工人们揭发和纠正过来。（新华社）
