Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th (TASS): The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has issued the following statement:

    The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, together with the chairmen of all central trade union committees, unanimously, fully, and completely endorses the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "Regarding the Anti-Party and Anti-State Crimes of Beria," and will strictly follow and resolutely implement this decision.

    The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, representing millions of factory workers and office staff in the Soviet Union, expresses its heartfelt gratitude to the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Party for resolutely and promptly exposing and purging the most despicable traitor and adventurer, agent of international imperialism, and sworn enemy of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, Beria.

    The liquidation of Beria's criminal and adventurous actions once again proves that all anti-Soviet conspiracies of foreign imperialist forces have been and will be shattered by the indestructible strength and great unity of the Party, the government, and the people.

    The unity of our Party's ranks has been the decisive condition for achieving victory in the struggle to build socialism and against all enemies of the people at every stage.

    The unity of our Party's ranks has been the decisive condition for the Soviet people's victory in the most severe trials of the Great Patriotic War.

    The unity of our Party's ranks is now and will continue to be the greatest vitality of Soviet society, confidently advancing towards communism.

    The statement continues, noting that the working people of the Soviet Union see that, after the death of J.V. Stalin, the Central Committee of the Communist Party has ensured uninterrupted and correct leadership of all aspects of our country's life, guaranteed the strengthening of our motherland's economic and defense capabilities, ensured the continuous development of all sectors of the national economy, guaranteed the further improvement of the Soviet people's lives, and guaranteed the enhancement of the Soviet Union's international position and prestige.

    The statement continues by saying that the trade unions must draw the necessary conclusions from the decision of the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and draw political lessons from the Beria affair.

    The trade unions must improve their work, making it more perfect, mobilizing the creativity of the masses on a larger scale, to implement the historic resolutions of the 19th Party Congress, which stipulated the road for our country to build communism.

    To victoriously carry out these tasks, trade unions must constantly promote democracy, strictly adhere to the principle of collectivity in their work, strive to enhance revolutionary vigilance, further expand self-criticism, especially criticism from below regarding shortcomings in trade union and economic work, and constantly strengthen and expand their ties with the masses. The sacred task of all trade union organizations is to pay attention to the demands of the working people and constantly strive to improve their material well-being.

    The primary task of all trade union organizations is to improve their work among employees, to educate them in the spirit of believing in the invincibility of the great communist cause and selfless loyalty to our Party and the socialist motherland, and to educate them in the spirit of the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and proletarian internationalism.

    The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party that the trade unions have always been and will continue to be the loyal and reliable supporters of the Communist Party and its Central Committee.

    The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the workers, office staff, and intellectuals of our country will unite more closely around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee and the Soviet government, and under their long-tested leadership, will mobilize their creativity and all their strength to victoriously implement the magnificent plan of building communism.
