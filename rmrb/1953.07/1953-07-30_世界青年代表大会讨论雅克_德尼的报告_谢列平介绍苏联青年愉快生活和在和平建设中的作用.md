Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 28th. According to TASS: The Third World Youth Congress began discussing Jacques Denis' report at its meeting on the 26th.

The first speaker at the morning session was the Italian representative, Emo Egoli, the National Secretary of the Italian Socialist Youth Federation, who said: The Italian delegation includes representatives of various political organizations with different tendencies. The delegation fully agrees with Jacques Denis' report because it reflects the wishes of Italian youth. The recent elections in Italy proved the democratic trend of the Italian people and Italian youth. Italian youth are all saying, "No to war." Italian youth are working hard to implement the measures proposed by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Their struggle for their rights has been successful.

Brazilian and Chilean youth representatives then spoke about the struggles of youth in their respective countries. Raul Morales Adrias, a Chilean Radical Party youth representative, said in his speech that Chilean youth are fighting against the infiltration of foreign capital, mainly American capital, into the most important sectors of Chile's national economy. This struggle has intensified since the signing of the US-Chile military agreement.

Hubert Schwab, the head of the Austrian youth delegation, said: Austrian youth and the Austrian people hope to conclude an Austrian peace treaty. Austrian youth do not want war, nor do they want to join armies to fight with the youth of other countries. Austrian youth want to work and study.

After a speech by Petersen, a representative of the Norwegian secret temperance society, Ionica Marin, a young Romanian worker, extended warm and friendly congratulations to the World Youth Congress on behalf of the youth of the Romanian capital. Next, Mandel, the representative of the Women's International Democratic Federation, spoke, emphasizing that the World Youth Congress is of great significance for the struggle for peace and for the rights of youth. Youth play a huge role in the struggle to ease international tensions.

James Arnison, a British representative, expressed the views of the majority of British youth in his speech, saying: We are fighting for peace, for maintaining the idea of peaceful coexistence and peaceful negotiation. He said: We have had enough of the disasters of the arms race, and Britain has extended the length of military service under the orders of the United States. British youth demand the withdrawal of the 60,000 American troops stationed in Britain in order to safeguard Britain's national independence.

Representatives from Sweden, Iran, Australia, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Guatemala, and Nigeria also spoke at the morning session.

Canadian representative Wilmot spoke at the afternoon session. He accused the US government of preventing the Canadian Toronto basketball champions from attending the festival. He pointed out that within the Canadian religious community and religious youth, there are more and more people advocating peaceful negotiation. The Canadian youth attending the Congress pledged to do their utmost to promote peace and friendship throughout the world.

The Congress warmly welcomed the speech by Shelepin, the head of the Soviet delegation. On behalf of the Soviet youth, Shelepin congratulated the Congress, saying: We are all here because of our sincere desire for everyone to unite and work together to make every young person happy. Since in many countries, the majority of young people still do not have economic, social, and political rights, our primary responsibility is to defend the legitimate rights and interests of young people. The Soviet delegation believes that the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth are fully in line with the interests of the world's broadest youth and fully agrees with its lofty work for the benefit of the world's youth.

Shelepin then talked about the role of Soviet youth in peaceful construction and their happy lives. He said: Soviet youth lead a happy life and enjoy full opportunities to develop their minds and bodies. Our youth and all our people are united and firmly opposed to war. Soviet youth are convinced that different social systems can coexist peacefully. Soviet youth have done their utmost to develop contacts with the youth of all countries and are willing to discuss any concrete proposals for establishing or developing friendly contacts and mutual cooperation.

He pointed out that the World Federation of Democratic Youth and its organizations in various countries have achieved great successes. He called for strengthening youth solidarity in various ways.

Shelepin said: In order to effectively defend youth rights and meet the urgent needs of youth, peace is necessary. The Soviet delegation supports these proposals and calls on all youth to endorse the resolution of the Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council on launching a world movement for negotiation and to support the movement of the people and youth in colonial and dependent countries for self-determination. Soviet youth severely condemn the use of force against the national liberation movements of various countries.

Finally, Shelepin cheered for peace and world youth friendship. At this moment, the whole venue burst into cheers, and the participants sang the World Democratic Youth March in many languages.

Japanese youth representative, Anamura (transliteration), Secretary-General of the Japan Democratic Youth League, said that as a result of the imperialists' militarization of Japan, Japanese youth are living a miserable life, attacked by unemployment and poverty. Precisely because of this, the struggle of Japanese youth for peace and the defense of youth rights is developing day by day. Japanese young workers actively participated in the recent large-scale strikes. The struggle of Japanese students for peace and the freedom of their motherland is also on the rise. These struggles have strengthened the unity among Japanese youth, which is reflected in the Second National Youth Congress held in March this year. Representatives from 341 organizations with 1.35 million members attended the Congress. The Japanese representative finally expressed full support for Jacques Denis' report.

Stanley Gozele, head of the Ceylon youth delegation, said: Ceylonese youth stand at the forefront of the struggle for national independence. We will strive to more closely unite the youth of all strata in Ceylon to carry out the struggle for peace and national independence, so that Ceylon can achieve peace and Ceylon can develop its national economy and culture.

Representatives from Portugal, Denmark, Cuba, New Zealand, Poland, Burma, France, and other countries also spoke at the afternoon session.
