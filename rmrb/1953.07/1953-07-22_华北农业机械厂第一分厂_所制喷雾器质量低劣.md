A letter from Shi Zheqing of the United Cooperative of Yangxin County, Shandong Province: The Shandong Provincial Cooperative supplied our county with 800 spraying machines in May and June of this year. Our county inspected 200 of them, and the result was that 26 of them could not be used due to missing or damaged parts. Among them, three were missing switches, seven had bent water injection cylinders, five were missing copper balls, ten had broken air chamber cylinders, and one had a leaky spray pipe. Currently, insect plagues have been discovered in various districts of our county, and spraying machines are needed urgently. The above-mentioned spraying machines were produced by the First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory. This factory's practice of producing substandard pest control equipment not only wastes state resources but also harms the interests of farmers. We request that the First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory improve the quality of the spraying machines it produces in the future and conduct a thorough inspection of the spraying machines that have not yet left the factory. For spraying machines that have already been sold but cannot be used, the factory should quickly find ways to recall them or send people out to repair them.

    华北农业机械厂第一分厂
    所制喷雾器质量低劣
    山东省阳信县合作社联合社史哲青来信：山东省合作总社在今年五、六月份供应我县喷雾器八百部。我县检查了二百部，结果有二十六部因零件缺少或破坏而不能使用，其中没有开关的三部，唧水筒弯曲的七部，少铜球的五部，气室筒坏了的十部，喷水管漏水的一部。当前我县各区均发现虫灾，正需要喷雾器使用；以上情况就影响了我县治虫工作的开展。按这批喷雾器是华北农业机械厂第一分厂的出品。该厂这种对治虫器械粗制滥造的做法，不但浪费了国家资财，并且损害了农民利益。我们要求华北农业机械厂第一分厂今后提高所制喷雾器的质量，并对未出厂的喷雾器进行认真检查；对于已销出而不能使用的喷雾器，该厂应迅速设法收回或派人外出进行修理。
