Farmers in Many Regions Across the Country
    Begin to Pay Summer Grain Tax

    Currently, farmers in nineteen provinces and suburban areas of major cities across the country have begun to pay summer grain tax to the state. These regions include the main wheat-producing areas of Central South, East China, North China, as well as Southwest and Northwest China. A total of thirty provinces and suburban districts in our country have summer harvested crops, and the farmers in these areas pay summer grain tax to the state every year. At present, farmers in some areas with later harvests will begin to pay grain at the end of July or the beginning of August. Farmers in the Southwest and Northwest regions, who started earlier, have successively sent grain to state warehouses.

    This year, summer-harvested crops in some areas have suffered from varying degrees of disaster. Farmers in disaster areas are very concerned about "how to levy public grain this year and how to reduce it in disaster areas." People's governments at all levels, especially in disaster areas, have formulated reduction and exemption methods based on the actual local conditions and after soliciting the opinions of farmers, emphasizing the conscientious implementation of the policy of reduction and exemption according to law, correctly grasping the scale of reduction and exemption, and focusing on taking care of severely affected areas. The Henan Provincial People's Government stipulates that townships with less than 35% summer harvest will not be levied summer grain tax; those with 40% to 60% harvest will have 70% to 80% of the public grain payable reduced. The Anhui Provincial People's Government has also made similar provisions for severely affected areas in northern Anhui. In addition, local people's governments have also specifically stipulated methods for taking care of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, as well as the elderly, widowed, weak, and disabled households lacking labor, and impoverished areas. After democratic appraisal and implementation of the policy of reduction and exemption according to law during the summer levy in accordance with these regulations, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers and has played a significant role in stabilizing and improving the production enthusiasm of farmers.

    Before the summer levy this year, most rural areas carried out a struggle against "bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline." The work style of many cadres has been significantly improved. In the levy work, policies were clearly explained to the grain levy cadres, emphasizing the need to follow the mass line, seek truth from facts, and complete the levy task in accordance with policies. Appropriate arrangements have also been made for the summer levy in rural work. The directors of the finance departments of the Sichuan and Shaanxi Provincial People's Governments have led working groups to go deep into rural areas to inspect the implementation of the summer levy policy. The summer burden rates stipulated by various localities have also been further adapted to the local harvest conditions and the actual affordability of farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 全国许多地区的农民  开始缴纳夏季公粮

    全国许多地区的农民
    开始缴纳夏季公粮
    目前，全国已有十九个省和大城市的郊区农民先后开始向国家缴纳夏季公粮。这些地区包括中南、华东、华北以及西南和西北的主要产麦地区。我国有夏收作物的共三十个省份和市郊区，这些地方的农民每年都向国家缴纳夏季公粮；目前，有些收获较晚的地区，农民要在七月底或八月初才开始缴粮。而开始较早的西南区和西北区农民已陆续把粮食送入国家仓库。
    今年有一部分地区夏收作物曾受到不同程度的灾害，灾区农民对“今年公粮怎样征，灾区怎样减”非常关心。各地区特别是灾区的人民政府都根据当地实际情况并征求了农民的意见，制订了减免办法，强调认真贯彻依法减免政策，正确地掌握减免尺度，着重照顾了重灾区。河南省人民政府规定：以乡为单位，夏收不足三成五者，不征夏季公粮；收成在四成到六成者，减征应缴公粮的百分之七十到八十。安徽省人民政府对淮北重灾地区也作了类似的规定。此外，各地人民政府还具体规定了照顾烈属、军属、工属和孤寡老弱缺乏劳力的困难户以及贫瘠地区的负担办法。按照这些规定在夏征中进行民主评议、贯彻依法减免政策后，受到广大农民的热忱欢迎，对稳定并提高农民的生产积极性起了很大作用。
    今年大部分农村在夏征前，曾进行了“反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪”的斗争。许多干部的作风有了显著改进。各地在征收工作中，对征粮干部明确交代了政策，强调走群众路线实事求是的按政策完成征收任务。并将夏征在农村工作中作了适当安排。四川、陕西省人民政府财政厅长都带领了工作组，深入农村检查夏征政策的执行情况。各地规定的夏季负担率也进一步适应了当地收获情况和农民实际负担能力。（新华社）
