    Record of the Japanese People's Anti-American Military Base Congress

    On June 25th, over a hundred rallies for peace were held throughout Japan. On this day, three major gatherings took place in Tokyo alone: besides the "Japanese People's Rally to Promote the Korean Armistice" held in Sumida Park and the "Memorial Service for the Victims of the Korean War" held in Asakusa Honganji Temple, there was also the "Japanese People's Anti-American Military Base Congress" held at the "Shibuya Public Hall," marking the beginning of the Japanese people's "Peace Month" activities.

    In the past year, the Japanese people's struggle for peace has advanced significantly, and the people's strength has grown remarkably. Currently, the Japanese people are launching a struggle against American military bases throughout the country. To discuss further unifying and strengthening the national anti-military base struggle, 479 representatives from the people of 39 prefectures and local military base areas, as well as representatives from labor unions and democratic groups, convened this significant "Japanese People's Anti-American Military Base Congress."

    The congress lasted for two days. The venue displayed a startling large map of Japan with 733 military bases marked on it. On both sides of the map hung slogans such as "People of the whole country unite to oppose military bases."

    The congress opened at exactly 10:00 a.m. on the 25th. After Kuroda Hidetoshi, representative of the congress preparatory committee, reported on the preparations for the congress, Hirano Yoshitaro, Hasebe Hiroko, Yanagida Kenjuro, Hoshino Yoshiji (representative of Uchinada Village), Terashima Kenzo (representative of the Anti-Mount Asama Base Establishment Alliance), Okada Haruo, Hamano Kiyoshi, and Wada Jiro were elected to form the presidium.

    Hirano Yoshitaro delivered a general report. After explaining the high tide of the international peace movement and Japan's position in the struggle for peace, he spoke about the current situation of American military bases in Japan and the seriousness of the harm military bases inflict on the Japanese people. He said: The number of American military bases in Japan has increased from 603 to 733, and it is still increasing. From the current international situation, this is undoubtedly a serious problem. At the same time, not only are airfields and training areas becoming military bases, but Japan's entire industrial infrastructure, such as the construction of power dams, transportation facilities, and factories, is also moving towards militarization. American military bases in Japan have disrupted the entire lives of the Japanese people. The land occupied by military bases is almost equal to the entire area of Kyushu Island. Beautiful coastlines and rich fishing grounds have become training grounds for landing craft and gunboats. The presence of "jeep girls" is everywhere. Atrocities such as American soldiers raping Japanese women occur everywhere. The decline of morality has become a serious problem affecting children's education. Next, Hirano Yoshitaro pointed out: The Japanese people throughout the country have launched a struggle against American military bases and have formed a broad united front. This struggle is currently developing.

    Ozawa Masamoto, representative of the Japan-China Friendship Association, exposed the atrocities of the American military to the congress. Horiye Yuichi, representative of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, also exposed the conspiracy of American adventurers to create the Berlin incident, and he pointed out that any provocation against the forces of world peace is bound to fail.

    The congress began to hear reports from local representatives. Hoshino Yoshiji, representative of the anti-Uchinada Village base struggle who participated in the congress, reported on the recent struggle of the people of Uchinada Village. He said: Due to the persistent and heroic struggle of the people of Uchinada Village, the American military has not been able to fully use the Uchinada base. When the Yoshida Cabinet meeting decided on June 2 to hand over Uchinada to the American military for permanent use, the people of Uchinada Village angrily dismantled the 10,000-meter-long barbed wire fence erected by the American soldiers on the beach, built boat sheds on the beach, and launched fishing boats. Workers of the Hokuriku Railway also rose up to support them, and their union resolved to refuse to transport any military supplies to Uchinada Village. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Private Railway Workers' Union have successively issued statements supporting this resolution. Now, 300 to 400 people from Uchinada Village guard the impact area day and night, sleeping on the six-meter-wide "iron plate road" leading to the training base, and continue their struggle, many of them mothers holding nursing infants. His report was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

    The meeting continued at 1:00 p.m. After Kawatake Yoshio (Communist Party), Nakahara Kenji (Labor-Farmer Party), and Matsui Iwao (Socialist Party Reconstruction Faction) delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress, the congress read out congratulatory telegrams and letters, including those from the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee in Beijing, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Oyama Ikuo from Budapest, and Matsumoto Saneki, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, from prison. Then the congress announced that a liaison from the workers of the Japan Steel Works Akabane Factory, which is managed by the American military, said that their strike was still ongoing, and none of the 6,000 workers had gone to work today. This news was warmly welcomed by all the representatives. The congress immediately passed a resolution to write a letter encouraging the workers of the Japan Steel Works Akabane Factory to persist in their struggle. Next, the congress continued to hear reports from local representatives.

    The struggle against the establishment of a military base on Mount Asama is another major struggle following the struggle against the Uchinada Village base, and 29 representatives participated in the congress. Three of the representatives successively reported to the congress, expressing their determination to persist in the struggle and absolutely not allow the land reclaimed by the people of Mount Asama with their blood and sweat to fall into the hands of the American military.

    Oshiro Masao, a representative from Okinawa Island, reported on the heroic struggle of the people of Okinawa Island against American military bases. He said that Okinawa Island has become a large integrated base for the United States, and one-third of the island's land has been occupied and built into military bases, and residents have been driven into the valleys or beaches. However, American soldiers are still constantly occupying land. The islanders really cannot bear it anymore. Recently, in June, when the American military forcibly took over land, the farmers sat in the rice paddies to resist. Thanks to the support of the people throughout the island, they finally stopped the American military from taking over the land.

    Representatives from Kumamoto, Kagawa, Hiroshima, Kyoto City, Hokkaido, Kanagawa, Miyagi, Iwakuni City, Tachikawa, Yamagata Prefecture, Wakayama Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, and Gunma Prefecture successively reported on the situation of military bases in various places and the local people's struggle against military bases. Every report strongly aroused the hatred of the participating representatives for the American aggressors and increased their determination and confidence in the struggle.

    From 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on the second day of the congress, the congress split into four group meetings to discuss the impact of military bases on the Japanese economy, the impact of military bases on Japanese social customs and education, the impact of military bases on Japanese academics and culture, and the relationship between the labor movement and the anti-military base struggle.

    The speeches of the representatives at the first group meeting painfully described the serious harm of American military bases to the Japanese economy, especially the damage to the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen in military base areas, exposed the Yoshida government's deceptive means of forcibly requisitioning land to build American military bases, and pointed out that local feudal forces were accomplices in the establishment of military bases by the American and Japanese reactionaries. The conclusion of the group meeting pointed out: In the struggle against military bases, it is necessary to strengthen the struggle to overthrow local feudal forces; the struggle against military bases must be developed into a struggle of the people throughout the country; and the experience of the struggle against the military bases in Uchinada Village and Mount Asama should be learned, and a united front of people from all walks of life should be organized with the worker-peasant alliance as the core. The speeches of the representatives at the second group meeting condemned the adverse effects of American military bases on Japanese children's education and social customs. They unanimously believed that the problems of social customs and education could not be solved without the withdrawal of the American troops, and advocated launching a movement to protect women and children. The speeches of the representatives at the third group meeting exposed the damage of American military bases to Japanese historical relics and cultural facilities, as well as the direct and indirect impact on Japanese culture and academic research. The speeches of the representatives pointed out that even old scholars who bury themselves in academic research and do not care about politics have risen up to oppose military bases. The representatives unanimously believed that in order to protect Japanese culture and academics, it is necessary to launch a nationwide struggle against military bases. The group meeting decided to hold exhibitions nationwide to widely inform the Japanese people of the true situation of military bases destroying Japanese culture and academics. The speeches of the representatives at the fourth group meeting emphasized that workers should unite with farmers to jointly carry out the struggle against military bases. They unanimously advocated that the congress should request the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan to accept and implement the resolutions of the Japanese People's Anti-American Military Base Struggle Congress, strengthen the joint struggle of workers and peasants, and write letters to salute the Japan Steel Works Akabane Factory Union and the Hokuriku Railway Union, which are carrying out the struggle against military bases.

    The congress continued at 3:00 p.m. After reading out dozens of congratulatory telegrams from the National Peace Council of Hungary and others, Iwama Masao, chairman of the first group meeting, Ueda Shozaburo, chairman of the second group meeting, Kozai Yoshishige, chairman of the third group meeting, and Wada Jiro, chairman of the fourth group meeting, successively reported to the congress on the results of the discussions in each group, and the delegates to the congress unanimously expressed their agreement.

    In the midst of heated discussions, the congress passed the "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Struggle Policy and Organizational Policy," the "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Congress Resolution," the "Letter to the Japanese People," the "Letter to the People of the World," the "Resolution on Opposing the Military Bases in Uchinada Village and Mount Asama," and the "Resolution on Opposing the Okinawa Base," and resolved to establish a national preparatory committee for opposing military bases, and elected more than 220 people from all walks of life, local councils, and national assembly members as preparatory committee members.

    The "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Struggle Policy and Organizational Policy" is divided into two parts: basic policy and current policy. The basic policy has a total of thirteen articles, including preventing the establishment of new military bases, removing existing military bases, developing the struggle to remove military bases into a struggle of the people throughout the country, launching a movement to demand compensation for all losses of land, property, and life suffered due to the establishment of military bases, launching a movement to demand the abolition of the San Francisco Separate Peace Treaty, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," and all other treaties and laws related to military bases, and organizing all groups and individuals opposing military bases, establishing a national anti-military base conference organization, and establishing corresponding organizational structures in each prefecture and county, and contacting and supporting each other. The current policy has a total of six articles, including launching a signature campaign against military bases throughout the country, launching movements such as petitions, signatures, speeches, rallies, demonstrations, and strikes to remove military bases, and preparing to hold national conferences of representatives of farmers and fishermen, representatives of workers, and representatives of academic and cultural circles to demand the removal of military bases.

    The "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Congress Resolution" listed the harmfulness of American military bases in Japan to the Japanese people, and finally said: "We are determined to unite with all patriotic political parties, groups, and individuals, and further cooperate with the forces of peace throughout the world to launch a large-scale people's movement to remove military bases. To this end, we demand the complete removal of military bases in the name of the people throughout the country. We oppose the stationing of foreign troops that are inextricably linked to military bases, oppose rearmament, and refuse the U.S. Mutual Security Agency's assistance. We demand the rapid establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, promote free trade with all countries, and establish Japan's peaceful life and peaceful economy. We demand a swift end to the war in Korea. Consultations should be held by the five major powers, including China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, to establish peace. We demand the abolition of the San Francisco Separate Peace Treaty, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" that have plunged Japan into its current state, and hold the government responsible for signing these treaties accountable. This struggle is difficult and long-term, but we will carry out the struggle to the final victory regardless of any situation that may occur."

    During the discussion, the representative of the struggle committee of the Japan Steel Works Akabane Factory, which is managed by the American military - a young worker - reported to the congress on the process of their struggle and their determination to persevere to the end. A guest - Domon Koichi, vice-chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union - addressed the congress. Kushida Ruki, of the Japan Democratic Women's Club, handed over 766 signatures collected by students of Aoyama Gakuin against the Uchinada Village military base, and dozens of congratulatory letters written to the people of Uchinada Village by the staff of Kiyose Hospital, to the representative of Uchinada Village. The audience responded with warm applause.

    At around 9 o'clock, the congress, filled with the victorious confidence of the entire delegation in striving for Japan's peace and independence, shouted "Long live the Japanese people's opposition to military bases" and then declared its closing. (Attached picture)

    日本人民反对美国军事基地大会记
    六月二十五日，日本全国各地举行了一百多个争取和平的集会。在这一天，东京一地就举行了三个重大的集会：除了在隅田公园举行的“日本人民促进朝鲜停战大会”和在浅草本愿寺举行的“追悼朝鲜战争牺牲者大会”以外，还有在“涩谷公会堂”举行的标帜着日本人民“和平月”活动开端的“日本人民反对美国军事基地大会”。
    最近一年来，日本人民争取和平的斗争已经显著地前进了，人民的力量显著地增强了。目前在全国各地，日本人民正掀起了反对美国军事基地的斗争。为了讨论进一步统一和加强全国各地反对军事基地的斗争，日本全国三十九个都、道、府、县军事基地的人民代表和工会、民主团体等代表四百七十九人，召开了这个具有重大意义的“日本人民反对美国军事基地大会。”
    会期一共两天。会场悬挂着一幅怵目惊心的有着七百三十三个军事基地的日本大地图。地图两旁高挂着“全国人民团结起来反对军事基地”等标语。
    大会于二十五日上午十点正开幕。大会在黑田秀俊代表大会筹备委员会报告了大会筹备经过后，选出了平野义太郎、长谷部弘子、柳田谦十郎、星野义次（内滩村代表）、寺岛乾藏（反对浅间山设立基地同盟代表）、冈田春夫、滨野清、和田次郎等组成主席团。
    平野义太郎作了总报告。他在说明了国际和平运动的高涨、日本在争取和平斗争中的地位以后，谈到美国在日本军事基地的现状，和军事基地对日本人民危害的严重性。他说：美国在日本的军事基地，已经从六百零三处增加到七百三十三处，而且还在增加着。从当前的国际形势来看，这无疑是一个严重的问题。同时，不仅是飞机场、演习地区，其他如建设发电水闸、交通机构以及工厂等日本整个工业机构，都在走向军事基地化。美国在日本的军事基地已经破坏了日本人民的整个生活。军事基地所占的土地，几乎相等于九州岛的全部面积。美丽的海岸和富裕的渔场变成了登陆艇、炮舰的演习场。到处充斥着吉普女郎。到处发生美国兵奸污日本妇女的暴行。风化的堕落已经成为影响儿童教育的严重问题。接着，平野义太郎指出：日本全国人民已经掀起了反对美国军事基地的斗争，并结成了广泛的统一战线。目前这个斗争正在发展之中。
    日中友好协会代表小泽正元向大会揭发了美军的暴行。日苏亲善协会代表堀江邑一也揭露了美国冒险家制造柏林事件的阴谋，他指出，任何向世界和平力量的挑衅，都是必然要失败的。
    大会开始听取各地方代表的报告。参加大会的反对内滩村基地斗争代表星野义次报告了内滩村人民最近的斗争情况。他说：由于内滩村人民坚持英勇的斗争，美军一直不能充分使用内滩基地。当六月二日吉田内阁会议决定把内滩交给美军永久使用后，内滩人民愤怒地拆除了美国兵围在海滩上长达一万公尺长的铁丝网，并在海滩上盖起船棚，驶出捕渔船。北陆铁路的工人也起来支援，他们的工会决议拒绝向内滩村运输一切军用物资。日本工会总评议会和私营铁道工会也相继发表了支持这一决议的声明。现在，内滩村人民每天有三、四百人日以继夜地守在落弹地区、睡在通往演习基地的沙滩上铺着的六公尺宽的“铁板道路”上，继续进行斗争，其中很多是抱着哺乳婴儿的母亲们。他的报告一再被掌声所打断。
    下午一时继续开会。细川嘉六（共产党）、中原健次（劳农党）、松井岩夫（社会党再建派）相继向大会致祝词后，大会宣读了包括来自北京的亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，来自布达佩斯的大山郁夫以及发自监牢中的日共中央委员松本三益的贺电、贺信等。接着大会又宣布，美军管理的日本制钢所赤羽工厂工人派来连络的人说，他们的罢工仍在坚持，六千名工人中，今天依然没有一个工人上班。这个消息获得全体代表热烈欢迎。大会旋即通过决议，写信鼓励日本制钢所赤羽工厂工人坚持斗争。接着，大会继续听取各地方代表报告。
    反对浅间山设立军事基地的斗争，是继反对内滩村基地斗争后的另一个大斗争，并有二十九个代表参加大会。其中三个代表相继向大会作了报告，表示了他们决心坚持斗争，绝对不让浅间山人民用血汗开垦出来的土地落入美军之手。
    冲绳岛的代表大城昌夫报告了冲绳岛人民反对美国军事基地的英勇斗争。他说，冲绳岛已经成了美国的一个大的综合基地，全岛已经有三分之一的土地被霸占建成军事基地，居民被赶到山谷中或海滩上去，然而美国兵还不断在霸占土地，岛上居民实在忍无可忍，最近六月间，美军强迫接收土地时，农民们坐在田中进行反抗，由于全岛人民的支援，他们终于制止了美军接收土地。
    熊本、香川、广岛、京都市、北海道、神奈川、宫城、岩国市、立川、山形县，和歌山县、兵库县、爱知县、青森县、千叶县、群马县等地方代表先后报告了各地的军事基地情况和当地人民反对军事基地斗争的情况。每一个报告都强烈地激起了与会代表们对美国侵略者的仇恨，增加了他们斗争的决心和信心。
    大会第二天上午九时到下午二时，分成四个小组会，就军事基地对日本经济的影响问题、军事基地对日本社会风气和教育的影响问题、军事基地对日本学术和文化的影响问题，工人运动与反对军事基地斗争的关系问题，分别进行讨论。
    第一小组会上代表的发言，沉痛地叙述了美国军事基地对日本经济的严重危害，特别是对军事基地的农民和渔民生计的破坏，揭穿了吉田政府强制征收土地做美国军事基地的欺骗手段，指出了地方封建势力是协同美、日反动派建立军事基地的帮凶。小组会的结论指出：在反对军事基地斗争中要加强打倒地方封建势力的斗争；必须使反对军事基地的斗争发展为全国人民的斗争；以及学习反对内滩村及浅间山军事基地斗争的经验，以工农联盟为核心，组织各阶层人民的统一战线等等。第二小组会上代表们的发言控诉了美国军事基地对日本儿童教育和社会风气的恶劣影响，他们一致认为，不撤退美国军队，社会风气和教育问题都无法解决，并主张展开保卫妇女儿童的运动。第三小组会上代表们的发言揭露了美国军事基地对日本历史文物和文化设施的损害，以及直接间接给予日本文化、学术研究的影响。代表们的发言指出：现在甚至如埋头研究学术不问政治的老学者也已起来反对军事基地了。代表们一致认为：为了保卫日本的文化和学术，就需要展开全国反对军事基地的斗争。小组会决定要在全国范围内举行展览会，以广泛地使日本人民知道军事基地破坏日本文化学术的真实情况。第四小组会上代表们的发言强调指出工人应和农民结合起来共同进行反对军事基地的斗争，他们一致主张以大会名义要求日本工会总评议会接受并执行日本人民反对军事基地斗争大会的各项决议，加强工农的联合斗争，写信向进行反对军事基地斗争的日本制钢所赤羽工厂工会和北陆铁道工会致敬等等。
    大会在下午三时继续举行，在宣读来自匈牙利全国和平理事会等的数十封贺电后，即由第一小组会主席岩间正男、第二小组会主席上田庄三郎、第三小组会主席古在由重、第四小组会主席和田次郎相继向大会报告了各小组讨论的结果，大会代表一致表示同意。
    大会在热烈的讨论中，通过了“日本人民反对军事基地的斗争方针和组织方针”、“日本人民反对军事基地大会决议”、“告日本人民书”、“告全世界人民书”、“关于反对内滩村、浅间山军事基地的决议”、“关于反对冲绳基地的决议”，并决议成立全国反对军事基地筹备会，推举各阶层人民代表、地方议会和国会议员二百二十多人为筹备委员。
    “日本人民反对军事基地的斗争方针和组织方针”内容分为基本方针和当前方针两部分。基本方针共十三条，包括阻止新设军事基地、撤除原有军事基地，把撤除军事基地斗争发展为全国人民的斗争，展开要求赔偿由于设立军事基地而遭受的土地、财产、生命等一切损失的运动，展开要求废除旧金山单独和约、美日“安全条约”、美日“行政协定”及其他有关军事基地的一切条约和法律的运动，和把反对军事基地的一切团体和个人组织起来、建立全国性的反对军事基地会议的组织、并在各府各县成立相应的组织机构、互相联络支援等。当前方针共六条，包括在全国各地展开反对军事基地的签名运动，展开撤除军事基地的请愿、签名、演说会、集会、示威游行、罢工等运动，和筹备分别举行农民和渔民代表会议、工人代表会议、学术文化界代表会议等全国性的要求撤除军事基地大会等。
    “日本人民反对军事基地大会决议”历述了美国在日本的军事基地对日本人民危害的情况，最后说：“我们决心和一切爱国政党、团体、个人团结一致，进而和全世界和平力量合作，展开大规模的撤除军事基地的人民运动。为此，我们用全国人民的名义要求全面撤除军事基地。我们反对和军事基地有不可分的关系的外国军队的留驻，反对重整军备，拒绝美国“共同安全署”援助。我们要求迅速和中、苏两国建立邦交，促进和一切国家的自由贸易，确立日本的和平生活与和平经济。我们要求迅速结束朝鲜的战争。由包括中国在内的美、英、苏、法五大国进行协商以建立和平。我们要求取消使日本陷入目前状态的旧金山单独和约，美日“安全条约”，和美日“行政协定”，并追究签订这些条约的政府的责任。这个斗争是困难而且是长期的，但是，我们将不顾会发生任何事态，要把斗争进行到最后胜利。”
    在讨论过程中，美军管理的日本制钢所赤羽工厂工人斗争委员会的代表——一个年青的工人，向大会报告了他们这次斗争的经过和坚持到底的决心。来宾——国营铁道工会副主席土门幸一向大会致词。日本民主妇女俱乐部栉田蕗把青山学院学生征集的七百六十六个反对内滩村军事基地的签名，和清濑医院职工写给内滩村人民的几十封致敬信，交给了内滩村代表。全场报以热烈的掌声。
    九点多钟的时候，大会在全体代表充满了争取日本和平独立的胜利信心下，三呼“日本人民反对军事基地万岁”的口号后，宣告闭幕。（附图片）
