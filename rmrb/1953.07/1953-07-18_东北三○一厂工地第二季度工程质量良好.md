The engineering quality at the Northeast No. 301 Factory construction site has significantly improved after the quality education conducted in April, and the anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system campaign in May and June.

Last year, due to chaotic construction management and neglect of technical management, more than 600 quality accidents occurred at this project. The concrete quality was particularly poor. In the over 7,000 cubic meters of concrete already poured, there were 138 instances of voids, honeycombing, and pitted surfaces. The largest void had an area of 60 square centimeters. Out of 72 foundation projects, 10 required complete rework, 15 needed repairs, 6 needed to be leveled, and 34 had gaps at the bottom. The worst concrete strength only reached 30% to 50% of the designed strength. After conducting education on improving quality and launching the anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system campaign, the engineering quality has greatly improved. The over 1,000 cubic meters of concrete poured in April and May this year have basically eliminated honeycombing and pitted surfaces, and the strength has met the requirements. All 52 anchor bolt foundations installed this year meet the quality standards. The refractory brick masonry project was repeatedly reworked in the first quarter due to the brick joints not meeting quality requirements, delaying the project progress. Since May, the quality has fully met the requirements. The scrap rate for mechanical processing has also decreased from over 50% last year to just over 6% in May this year.

Last year, the leading cadres at this construction site did not pay attention to engineering quality, believing that poor quality was not a big deal and that honeycombing and pitted surfaces were unavoidable in concrete pouring. The general construction personnel juxtaposed progress against quality, only paying attention to speeding up progress and neglecting engineering quality. Workers generally did not understand the important meaning and methods of ensuring quality. When the construction organization was expanded into the Second Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau at the end of last year, the leadership had already learned from the lessons of poor quality and began to educate employees to establish the concept of "quality first, a project of vital and lasting importance." In April this year, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Northeast Branch of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration dispatched working groups to inspect the project and assist the construction site in using various forms of propaganda and mobilization to educate the masses on improving quality, mobilizing the masses to discuss methods of ensuring quality. In May and June, the construction site launched an anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system campaign, focusing on improving quality, mobilizing the masses to expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible for technical management, and discussing various measures to ensure quality. Now, for all projects, regardless of size, quality standards are first proposed before construction, and then operating procedures and construction methods are formulated based on these requirements. These procedures and methods must be discussed by the masses. This project has many new structures, and the employees initially did not master the operating techniques. In response to this situation, the construction site established a trial product system, stipulating that samples must be made before construction, and large-scale construction and production can only be carried out after the inspection personnel of both parties and Soviet experts deem them qualified. Before the trial production, technicians and workers must hold technical research meetings to study technical measures to ensure quality. The trial product system has been widely implemented since April. Since April, the construction site has also established a strict layer-by-layer inspection system. Now, each part of the project must first undergo inspection within the group, inspection by the team leader, and inspection by the project captain. Only after being deemed qualified can it be submitted to the company's quality inspection department for inspection. In this way, shortcomings can be corrected at any time during the construction process. The construction site strictly implements a reward and punishment system in terms of quality and guides the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism on quality issues.

    东北三○一厂工地第二季度工程质量良好
    东北三○一厂工程经过了四月份的质量教育，和五、六月份的反浪费和建立责任制运动，工程质量已经有了显著的改进。
    去年，由于工地施工管理混乱和忽视技术管理，这个工程曾经发生了六百多件质量事故。其中混凝土质量最为低劣，已经浇灌的七千多立方公尺混凝土工程中，共有狗洞、蜂窝、麻面一百三十八处。最大的狗洞面积达六十平方公分。七十二个基础工程有十个要全部返工、十五个要补修、六个要铲平、三十四个底部有空隙槽。混凝土强度最差的只达到设计强度的百分之三十至五十。经过进行关于改进质量的教育和反浪费建立责任制运动，工程质量已大大提高。今年四、五月份浇灌的一千多立方公尺混凝土，基本上消灭了蜂窝麻面，强度也都达到要求；今年安装的五十二个地脚螺丝基础，已全部合乎质量标准。砌耐火砖工程，第一季度因为砖缝达不到质量要求，曾经多次返工重砌，拖延了工程进度，从五月份起，质量已经完全达到要求。机械加工的废品率也由去年的百分之五十以上减至今年五月的百分之六强。
    去年这个工地的领导干部不重视工程质量，认为质量差些没啥，打混凝土就免不了蜂窝麻面。一般施工人员都把进度和质量对立起来，只注意赶进度，不重视工程质量。工人普遍不懂得保证质量的重要意义和方法。去年年底施工组织扩大为有色金属管理局第二工程公司时，领导方面已经接受了质量低劣的教训，开始教育职工树立“百年大计，质量第一”的观念。今年四月，中共中央东北局、中央重工业部、有色金属工业管理局东北分局等分别派工作组对工程进行检查，协助工地采用各种宣传鼓动方式对群众进行有关改进质量的教育，发动群众讨论保证质量的方法。五、六月份工地开展了反浪费和建立责任制运动，以改进质量为重点之一，发动群众揭发了技术管理上的无人负责现象。讨论了保证质量的各种措施。现在，无论大小工程，在施工前都首先提出质量标准，而后根据这个要求拟定操作规程和施工方法。这些规程和方法都要经过群众讨论。这个工程有很多新的结构，职工们最初掌握不了操作技术。根据这个情况，工地建立了试制品制度，规定在施工前要先做出样品，经甲、乙双方检查人员和苏联专家认为合格后，才能大量施工制作。在试制之前，技术人员和工人要开技术研究会，研究保证质量的技术措施。试制品制度四月份以后已普遍推行。四月份以后，工地还建立了严格的层层检查制度。现在，每一部分工程都要先经过组内检查、班长检查、工程队长检查，认为合格后，才交公司质量检查科检查。这样，施工过程中发现缺点时，随时就可以纠正。工地在质量方面严格地执行奖惩制度，并引导群众在质量问题上开展批评和自我批评。
