    Heighten Vigilance to Prevent Enemy Sabotage Activities
    Resolutely Ensure the Thorough Implementation of the Armistice Agreement
    Letter from all Comrades of the Dongdan Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau: The news of the official signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement filled every corner of our organization with excitement and joy. Some comrades even forgot to eat lunch in order to listen to the broadcast about the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. On the evening of July 27th, we held a symposium. Everyone unanimously agreed that the victory of the just anti-aggression war of the Chinese and Korean people and the striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are inseparable from the increasing strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the heroic war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side to resist aggression and defend peace. At the meeting, everyone unanimously expressed: We extend our highest respect to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    For more than two years, American imperialism has constantly tried every possible means to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations. Only because of the consistent struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the great efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean Armistice Agreement could be finally signed. However, whether the terms of the armistice agreement can be fully observed remains to be proven by facts on the American side. We should also be highly vigilant: Some warmongers on the American side, especially the Syngman Rhee clique, are stepping up their clamor against the armistice; we demand that the American side thoroughly change its attitude of condoning Syngman Rhee's deliberate sabotage of the armistice. We, the Chinese and Korean people, must fight to the end for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, in order to win a greater victory for world peace.

    In the process of resisting America and aiding Korea, our public security workers have shouldered the great task of eliminating spies and secret agents and safeguarding the security of the motherland. In the future, we are determined to continue to heighten our vigilance, stand tirelessly at our posts, fight against hidden enemies, and do a good job in defending the motherland.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    提高警惕防止对方破坏活动
    切实保证停战协定彻底实施
    北京市公安局东单分局全体同志来信：朝鲜停战协定正式签字的消息传来后，我们机关的每个角落里都洋溢着兴奋、愉快的气氛。有的同志为了收听关于朝鲜停战协定签字消息的广播，甚至忘记了吃午饭。七月二十七日晚间，我们召开了一个座谈会。大家一致认为：中朝人民正义的反侵略战争和争取和平解决朝鲜问题的胜利，是和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营日益强大，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩进行抵抗侵略、保卫和平的英勇战争分不开的。会上，大家一致表示：谨向英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军致崇高的敬礼！
    两年多来，美帝国主义曾经不断地千方百计地来阻挠朝鲜停战谈判。只是由于朝中人民一贯的坚持奋斗以及全世界爱好和平的人们的巨大努力，朝鲜停战协定才能最后签订。但停战协定的条款能否全面被遵守，仍然有待于美国方面用事实来证明。我们还应该高度警惕：美国方面一部分好战分子，特别是李承晚集团，正在加紧叫嚣反对停战；我们要求美国方面彻底改变纵容李承晚蓄意破坏停战的态度。我们中朝人民一定要为和平解决朝鲜问题奋斗到底，以争取世界和平的更大的胜利。
    在抗美援朝的过程中，我们公安工作者负起了肃清奸细、特务，保卫祖国安全的伟大任务。今后，我们决心继续提高警惕，紧张不懈地站在我们的工作岗位上，向隐蔽的敌人作斗争，作好保卫祖国的工作。
