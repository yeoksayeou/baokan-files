    The Communist Party is the organizing and inspiring force of Soviet society. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party, the Soviet people have achieved victories of world-historical significance in the cause of communist construction. In implementing the decisions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party ensures the further powerful upsurge of all sectors of the national economy and culture.

    The great strength of the Communist Party, which leads the Soviet people in construction activities, lies in the fact that the revolutionary theory of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin has been the foundation for formulating Party policies for many years. The Party has always believed and still believes that organizational work and improving the leadership methods in Party affairs, state work, economic and cultural construction are of great significance.

    The plenary sessions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various Union Republics, the Party's provincial, municipal, and district committees, held these days with the participation of Party activists to discuss the conclusions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, powerfully demonstrated the steel-like unity of the Party ranks and expressed the Party's close unity around its Central Committee. Those who participated in these plenary sessions expressed the will of the entire Party and all the Soviet people, angrily denouncing the crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Party and the people, the agent of international imperialism. These meetings fully supported the timely and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee to liquidate Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes, considering it the only correct course of action.

    In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on drawing political lessons from the Beria case and making necessary conclusions, the plenary sessions of Party committees at all levels criticized the shortcomings in the work of Party organizations and formulated measures to implement the tasks set by the Party Central Committee. The plenary sessions paid close attention to raising the level of the Party's organizational and political work, strengthening the Party's leadership in all links of the Party and state organs, and strictly adhering to the principles of Party leadership and the norms of Party life.

    The highest principle of our Party's leadership is the collectivity of leadership. The decision of one person is always, or almost always, a one-sided decision. The Party teaches us that only the collective political experience and collective wisdom of the Party Central Committee, based on the scientific foundation of Marxism-Leninism, can guarantee the correctness of the leadership of the Party and the state, ensure the consolidation and unity of the Party ranks, and guarantee the victorious construction of communism in our country.

    In every Party organization, the principle of collective leadership must be strictly observed. The plenary sessions of the Party committees of Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and other largest Party organizations pointed out that collectivity, as the most important principle of Party leadership, is often violated. Some Party organizations have not implemented the election system of Party organs stipulated in the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have not convened plenary sessions of Party committees within the prescribed time limits, have not regularly convened meetings of Party activists, and have not ensured the development of self-criticism, especially criticism from below.

    Some Party leaders imagine that there is no particularly great harm in not holding plenary sessions and meetings of Party activists, and that these meetings can be postponed and shelved. For example, Comrade Onuchin, secretary of the Party district committee in the Mikhailovsky district of the Primorsky Territory, holds this erroneous view. This district only held one plenary session in three months. In the Kirovabad and Kubyshev districts of the Tajik Republic, meetings of Party activists are rarely held. This means that the leaders of these district committees decide issues without obtaining the broad participation of the district committee members and Party activists, and do not use their experience and knowledge to improve work and achieve more efficient leadership of economic and cultural construction.

    The collectivity of leadership means that all fundamental decisions are made on the basis of in-depth research and comprehensive discussion. The greatest strength of Party leadership lies in collectivity. No matter how experienced the leaders are, they cannot replace the collective experience and knowledge. In any leading body, there are people with a lot of experience, and using this experience will help to make correct decisions and achieve efficient leadership.

    Violations of the collectivity of leadership often manifest in the fact that meetings of Party leading organs are held without sufficient quorum and necessary preparation. For example, meetings of the executive committee of the Khabarovsk Territory are often convened hastily. Members of the standing committee do not receive materials in advance and only learn about the draft decisions at the meeting. In such circumstances, one cannot expect an active discussion of the issues. Obviously, this kind of action hinders the realization of true collectivity of leadership.

    In many places, decisions on the most important work issues are sometimes made by soliciting opinions, without prior research and collective discussion in the Party's leading bodies. Comrade Chamatletdinov, the first secretary of the Party district committee in the Drozhzhanovsky district of the Tatar Autonomous Republic, adopts such an incorrect and erroneous method. He does not care about the regular role of the district committee's standing committee, often decides fundamental issues personally, and never even considers it necessary to inform the members of the district committee's standing committee and other secretaries of the decisions. Once, a plenary session of the Party district committee was held without the decision of the district standing committee. Apart from Comrade Chamatletdinov, the other secretaries of the district committee only learned about the plenary session half an hour before the meeting.

    This kind of working method diminishes the rights of Party committee members, weakens their sense of responsibility, and reduces the role of Party leading bodies. This is a crude violation of inner-Party democracy. This abnormal state sometimes leads Party committees to make unfounded decisions. Due to violations of collectivity, it is impossible to ensure due criticism and self-criticism in work – an important method for fighting shortcomings and defects.

    The principle of the collectivity of leadership requires that the leaders of Party organs consult with Party committee members, consult with Party activists, consult with Party members, listen to their opinions, and pay attention to their criticism and suggestions. For example, Comrade Stezhenko, secretary of the Chernivtsi city Party committee, prefers to decide many issues personally, does not pay attention to consulting with activists and Party members, and incorrectly understands criticism as damaging his prestige, which is intolerable. While leading a plenary session of the city committee, Comrade Stezhenko rudely interrupted city committee staff members who criticized him. Unfortunately, there are more than just one or two leaders who attempt not to criticize themselves and evade criticism. These leaders never think that there is no such thing as a Party member who is insured against criticism.

    The obligation of leaders is to set an example for Party members in dealing with criticism; to treat their own work self-critically, to do their best to promote the development of criticism and self-criticism, and to not only teach the masses but also constantly learn from them. Leaders, no matter what position they hold, should not bear criticism with a sense of grievance, and should not put their personal self-esteem above the interests of the Party and the state. Party workers should be the initiators of developing criticism, correctly welcome criticism, accept all valuable criticism and draw necessary conclusions from it.

    The Communist Party educates its cadres with a high spirit of principle, with the spirit of collective leadership, and with the ability to subordinate the opinions of individual leaders to the collective opinion. Comrade Stalin pointed out: The talent of acting collectively and the determination to subordinate individual comrades to the collective opinion are precisely what we call true Party courage. Without this courage, without subordinating one's own will to the will of the collective, without these qualities, there is no collective, no collective leadership.

    The duty of Party organizations is to actually and strictly observe the principle of collectivity of leadership, to observe the requirements of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the time limits for convening plenary sessions of Party committees and meetings of Party activists, and regarding the regularization of the work of all Party organs. Thoroughly realizing inner-Party democracy, observing the principles of Party leadership and the norms of Party life established by the Communist Party, this is the guarantee for further improving all Party work and enabling our country to advance smoothly along the road of building communism.

    最严格地遵守集体领导的原则
    ——苏联“真理报”七月十三日社论
    共产党是苏联社会的组织力量和鼓舞力量。由于党的英明领导，苏联人民在共产主义建设事业上取得了全世界历史意义的胜利。在实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决定中，党保证国民经济和文化所有部门的进一步的强大高涨。
    领导苏联人民建设活动的共产党的伟大力量在于：马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的革命理论是许多年来制订党的政策的基础。党过去认为现在仍认为：组织工作，改进党内事务、国家工作、经济和文化建设的领导方法，是有巨大意义的。
    这些天来，各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的州委员会、市委员会和区委员会，会同党的活动分子举行的讨论苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的结论的全体会议，强有力地表明了党队伍的钢铁般的团结，表示了党紧密地团结在自己的中央委员会的周围。参加这些全体会议的人们，表示了整个党和全体苏联人民的意志，愤怒地痛斥党和人民的死敌、国际帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的罪行。这些会议完全拥护党中央为清算贝利亚的反党和反国家罪行所采取的及时而坚决的措施，认为它是唯一正确的。
    根据苏联共产党中央委员会关于要从贝利亚事件吸取政治教训和做出必要的结论的指示，党各级委员会的全体会议批评了党组织的工作缺点，并拟定了执行党中央委员会规定的任务的措施。全体会议十分注意提高党的组织工作和政治工作的水平、加强党和国家机关一切环节中的党的领导、严格遵守党的领导原则和党的生活准则。
    我们党的领导的最高原则是领导的集体性。一个人的决定，从来是或者几乎从来是片面的决定。党教导我们说，只有根据马克思列宁主义的科学基础的党中央委员会底集体的政治经验、集体的英明性，才能保证党和国家的领导的正确，保证党队伍的巩固和团结，保证在我国胜利地建设共产主义。
    在每一个党的组织中必须最严格地遵守集体领导的原则。莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克及其他最大的党组织的党委员会的全体会议上都指出了，作为党的领导的最重要的原则的集体性，常常被违背。有些党的组织没有执行苏联共产党党章关于党机构的选举制度，没有按照规定期限召开党委员会全体会议，没有定规地召开党活动分子会议，没有保证展开自我批评特别是自下而上的批评。
    有些党的领导人员设想，没有全体会议和党活动分子的会议也没有特别大的害处，可以改移和搁置这些会议。例如，在滨海边疆区米海洛夫区，党区委员会书记俄努清同志就抱着这种错误观点。这个区三个月中只开一次全体会议。在塔吉克共和国的基洛夫巴德区和古比雪夫区，极少开党活动分子会议。这就是说，这些区委员会的领导人员不取得区委员会委员和党活动分子的广泛参加便决定问题，不使用他们的经验和知识来改善工作，来实现对于经济和文化建设的更干练的领导。
    领导的集体性就是说，一切原则性的决定，是在深刻的研究和全面的讨论的基础上作出的。党的领导的最伟大的力量就在于集体性。不论领导人员是怎样有经验，他们不能代替集体的经验和知识。在任何领导机构里都有人拥有很多经验，使用这些经验将有助于作出正确的决定，实现干练的领导。
    违背领导的集体性，常常表现在党的领导机构的会议没有足够的法定人数和必要准备就举行。例如，伯力边疆区常务委员会会议时常匆忙地召开。常委会委员事先没有接到材料，在会议上才知道决定的草案。在这样情形下不能希望积极地讨论问题。显然，这种行动阻碍实现真正的领导的集体性。
    许多地方最重要工作问题的决定有时用征询方法作出，没有在党的领导机构中预先研究和集体讨论。鞑靼自治共和国德罗赞诺夫区党区委员会第一书记查马列特知诺夫同志就是采取这样不正确的错误方法。他不关心区委常委会的经常作用，往往个人决定原则问题，甚至向来就不认为必须使区委会常务委员和其他书记知道决定。有一次党的区委全体会议没有经区常委会的决定便举行了，除了查马列特知诺夫同志以外，区委会其他书记在会前半小时才知道全体会议开会。
    这一类的工作方法，缩小了党委员会委员的权利，削弱了他们的责任心，减低了党领导机构的作用。这是粗鲁地违反党内民主制。这种不正常的状态使得有的党委员会有时会作出根据不足的决定。由于违背集体性，在工作中便不能保证应有的批评和自我批评——与缺点和毛病作斗争的重要方法。
    领导的集体性原则要求，党机构的领导人员同党委员会委员商量，同党活动分子商量，同共产党员商量，倾听他们的意见，注意他们的批评和建议。例如，契尔诺维茨克市党委员会书记斯捷曾科同志宁愿个人决定许多问题，不注意同活动分子及共产党员商量，不正确地把批评了解为损害自己威信，这是不可容忍的。在领导一次市委会全体会议时，斯捷曾科同志粗暴地截断市委会工作人员对他的批评。可惜的是，企图自己不批评并逃避批评的领导人员还不只一两个。这些领导人员从来不想，在党内不许有保险不受批评的老爷。
    领导者的义务——树立党员对待批评的榜样；自我批评地对待自己的工作，尽量促使批评和自我批评的发展，不但教导群众而且经常向群众学习。不论站在什么位置的领导人员，不应当以抱屈的情绪承受批评，不应当把个人的自尊心放在党和国家的利益之上。党的工作者应当是开展批评的发起者，正确地迎接批评，接受一切有价值的批评意见并且由此作出必要结论。
    共产党以高度原则性的精神，以集体领导、善于使个别领导人员的意见服从集体意见的精神，来教育自己的干部。斯大林同志曾指出：集体地行动的才干和使个别同志服从集体意见的决心，正是我们所说的真正的党的勇气。如果没有这种勇气，没有使自己的意志服从集体的意志，没有这些品质，也就没有集体，没有集体的领导。
    党的组织的职责在于：实际上最严格地遵守领导的集体性的原则，遵守苏联共产党党章关于召开党委员会全体会议、党活动分子会议的期限和关于一切党的机构正规化工作的要求。彻底实现党内民主、遵守共产党所制订的党的领导的原则和党的生活的准则，这是进一步提高全部党的工作，使我国顺利地循着建设共产主义的道路前进的保证。
