    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd—Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers fighting the enemy's counterattacks on the JinCheng front in Korea warmly congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army for annihilating more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits on Dongshan Island in Fujian Province.
    After the political organs of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army heard the broadcast of the victory news from Dongshan Island, they immediately printed it into a quick report and distributed it by motorcycle to the newly captured positions during the counterattack.
    In trenches concealed by trees, soldiers were reading the good news from the motherland in groups of three or five. They were encouraged by the double victory of themselves and their elder brothers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They said: How strong our motherland is! If the enemy dares to intrude, we will make them suffer a bloody nose!
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers originally wanted to write letters to congratulate the victory of their elder brothers in the People's Liberation Army, but they didn't have time. As soon as they finished reading the good news, they immediately picked up picks and shovels to dig fortifications in preparation for annihilating the enemy who came to counterattack. They asked the reporter to convey their warm congratulations to the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who won a major victory on Dongshan Island, and to convey the following words to them: We are very happy to hear this news. You have repelled the intrusion of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit troops on the coastal defense line of the motherland, and we are fighting the American aggressors and the Li pseudo-army in Korea. Let us work together to protect the great motherland that is undergoing peaceful construction, and jointly safeguard peace in the Far East and the world!

    解放军在东山岛歼灭蒋匪三千多名的胜利
    鼓舞了金城前线打击反扑敌人的志愿军
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】正在朝鲜金城前线打击反扑敌人的中国人民志愿军战士，向在祖国福建东山岛歼灭蒋介石残匪三千多名的中国人民解放军热烈祝贺。
    中国人民志愿军某部政治机关收听到东山岛的胜利消息的广播后，立即将它印成快报，用摩托车分送到反击中攻占的各处新阵地上去。
    在树丛掩盖着的战壕里，战士们三五成群地在阅读来自祖国的捷报。他们为自己的和中国人民解放军老大哥的双重胜利所鼓舞。他们说：咱们的祖国多强大啊！敌人敢来窜犯，就叫他碰得头破血流！
    中国人民志愿军战士们本想写信去祝贺解放军老大哥的胜利，但是他们没有时间，一读完捷报，都马上拿起洋镐、铁镐去挖工事，准备消灭前来反扑的敌人。他们要求记者替他们向警惕地保卫祖国海防的解放军老大哥表示热烈的祝贺，并且要记者把下面这些话转告在东山岛获得重大胜利的中国人民解放军某部的指挥员战斗员：我们听到这个胜利消息，非常高兴。你们在祖国海防线上打退了蒋介石残余匪军的窜犯，我们在朝鲜打击着美国侵略者和李伪军。我们共同努力，好好地保卫正在进行和平建设的伟大祖国，共同保卫远东和世界的和平！
