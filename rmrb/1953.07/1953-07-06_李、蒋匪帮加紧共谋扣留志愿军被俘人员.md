Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 5th: Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Just as news emerges that Syngman Rhee is preparing to continue forcibly detaining large numbers of prisoners of war, the Kuomintang bandit gang is also stepping up its collusion with Syngman Rhee to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

On the morning of the 4th, before holding talks with Robertson, Syngman Rhee held a meeting with Wang Dongyuan, the Kuomintang bandit gang's acting representative in South Korea. International News Service reported that they discussed the issue of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers detained on Jeju Island.

At the same time, Chinese People's Volunteers who have already been "released" by Syngman Rhee are still in the hands of Kuomintang bandit gang agents and Syngman Rhee's police in Busan. On the 4th, Kuomintang bandit gang agents, under the guise of Chinese People's Volunteers not directly repatriated on Jeju Island, wrote a letter to Syngman Rhee, requesting their release and transfer to Taiwan.

Sources here point out that one of Syngman Rhee's methods of undermining the Korean armistice is clearly to collude with the Kuomintang bandit gang to forcibly detain a large number of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The lenient attitude adopted by the U.S. towards Syngman Rhee's actions of forcibly detaining Chinese prisoners of war in the Busan area has greatly encouraged Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandit gang, emboldening them to act recklessly. The conspiracy of the Li and Chiang gangs to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers is now very clear, and the Korean and Chinese sides are closely watching whether the U.S. will take effective measures to stop the realization of this conspiracy.

    李、蒋匪帮加紧共谋扣留志愿军被俘人员
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者江南报道：正当有消息说李承晚准备继续强迫扣留大批战俘的时候，国民党匪帮也加紧和李承晚共谋强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    四日上午，李承晚在和罗伯逊举行会谈之前，曾经和国民党匪帮驻南朝鲜代理人王东原举行会议。国际新闻社报道，他们讨论的是关于被拘留在济州岛的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的问题。
    同时，已经被李承晚“释放”的志愿军被俘人员仍然在釜山国民党匪帮的特务分子和李承晚的警察手里。国民党匪帮的特务分子又在四日假借在济州岛的不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的名义，写信给李承晚，要求释放他们并把他们送到台湾去。
    此间人士指出，李承晚破坏朝鲜停战的手段之一，显然就是和国民党匪帮串通一气，强迫扣留大批中国人民志愿军被俘人员。美方对于李承晚在釜山地区强迫扣留中国战俘的行动所采取的纵容态度，已经大大鼓励了李承晚和国民党匪帮，使他们敢于胡作非为。李、蒋匪帮强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的阴谋现在已经很明显，朝中方面正在密切注视美方是否采取有效措施制止这个阴谋的实现。
