    Wòlóng Township Chief Yu Changlin Leads Peasants to Overcome Drought
    Yu Changlin is the township chief of Wolong Township in Nanyang County, Henan Province. In mid-May, he led the peasants of Zhangzhuang Village in the township to water and plant autumn crops, overcoming the threat of drought.
    In mid-April, after the wheat in Zhangzhuang Village suffered frost damage, all the villagers worried that the spring famine had not passed, and the summer famine was coming, and they were very panicked. After the People's Government led the peasants to rescue the wheat and lend grain, everyone calmed down and actively prepared to strive for a bumper autumn harvest to make up for the loss of the wheat harvest. However, it didn't rain for more than a month, and the ground was so dry that it cracked. The peasants watched as the autumn crops could not be sown, and they were restless. Yu Changlin was from this village. Seeing this situation, his heart was also heavy. He thought: "The wheat harvest will be reduced this summer, and the summer famine will closely follow the spring famine. Only by striving for a bumper autumn harvest can we overcome the disaster." So, he called on the masses to fight drought and plant, not relying on the heavens for rain. However, the peasants in this village had never had the habit of fighting drought and planting, and the ideological problem was not solved. Seeing that he couldn't push things forward by just talking, Changlin remembered leading the masses to control cotton pests last year. At that time, cotton aphids and spider mites were very serious, and the young cotton seedlings were severely damaged. In some cotton fields where spider mites were serious, at first glance, the cotton seedlings turned red. The township held one meeting after another, calling on the masses to catch and kill pests, but it was like a breeze in the ear, and it didn't work at all. Later, he borrowed a sprayer, filled it with lime-sulfur mixture, and went to his cotton field to do an experiment. Many people came to watch the fun at that time. Some people just said discouraging words: "Can this thing cure the red spider!" But after the medicine was sprayed on the cotton seedlings, the pests died immediately. Many peasants said, "This is really good, I also want to borrow a sprayer to control the pests." The movement to catch and kill cotton pests was launched in this way. Thinking of this, Changlin's confidence in leading the masses to fight drought and plant increased. He thought: "Just calling on people verbally is not enough, we must first open up a path for everyone." He and his family first carried water to plant 1.2 mu of cotton and 2 mu of sorghum. Three days later, the autumn seedlings emerged neatly. After the news spread, many peasants went to the fields to see, and everyone who saw it was envious. The peasant Zhao Fuyu saw that watering and planting really worked, and immediately asked Changlin for advice on watering and planting methods. Three or four days later, he saw Changlin and said with a smile: "Township chief, the autumn seedlings I watered have also come out!" Changlin used these facts to educate the peasants to fight drought, water, and plant. Faced with these vivid facts, the peasants in the village felt that the idea of relying on the heavens for food was wrong, and many people scrambled to carry water and plant.
    New problems came again. Some spring fields were not harrowed after plowing, and now there were mud clods of all sizes everywhere, making it impossible to water and plant. The new difficulties did not frighten Yu Changlin. He patiently carried out individual mobilization. One day, he ran to the house of the peasant Wang Wende and said with a smile: "Wende, why hasn't your spring field been planted?" Wende said coldly: "The ground is full of big mud clods, how can I plant it?" Changlin asked again: "Your family has ten people, and you planted six mu of wheat. This summer, each mu will produce at most two dou, a total of one shi and two dou of wheat. At most, you can eat for two months. What will you do if you can't get through to autumn after the wheat is finished?" Wende was speechless after being asked. Changlin continued: "If your family can put in some effort to plant two mu of sorghum now, you can get through two or three months, and you won't go hungry!" Wende's mother interjected, "Yes! Look how well the township chief plans, we should also plan for the future!" But Wende's thinking was still not clear, and he said impatiently: "I'll talk about it when my father comes back!" Wende's father's idea of waiting for rain was very serious. Seeing that the autumn seedlings planted by everyone had come out, he was very anxious and wanted to water and plant a little, but seeing that the mud clods were too big, he had no confidence. Changlin mobilized him and said, "Plant one tree is one tree, plant one fen is one fen," and proposed the method of breaking up the mud clods before planting. Later, with Changlin's personal help, he planted a few fen of autumn crops. The peasant Dai Qingshan's four mu of spring land was also not planted because the mud clods were too big. Changlin explained to him the benefits of "planting early and getting food early" and helped him go to the field to break up the mud clods. As a result, he carried water and planted 1.3 mu of cotton and 3 mu of sorghum. After the facts of Wang Wende's and Dai Qingshan's families breaking up mud clods and watering and planting spread, the peasants planted in the same way. All 120 mu of spring land in the village were planted with autumn crops. (Wang Zubei)

    卧龙乡乡长余长林领导农民战胜了旱荒
    余长林是河南南阳县卧龙乡的乡长。在五月中旬，他领导着该乡张庄村农民，浇水点种了早秋作物，战胜了旱荒的威胁。
    四月中旬，张庄村的小麦遭受霜灾以后，全村农民都担心春荒未过，夏荒又来，非常恐慌。经过人民政府领导农民抢救小麦和贷放粮食，大家才安下心来，积极准备争取秋季丰收，以弥补麦收的损失。但是，接着又是一个多月没有下雨，地里旱得裂了缝。农民们眼看着早秋作物播种不上，急得坐卧不安。余长林就是这个村里的人。他看到这个情况，心里也是沉甸甸的。他想：“今夏麦子减收了，夏荒紧跟着春荒来，只有争取秋季丰收，才能战胜灾荒。”于是就号召群众抗旱点种，不要靠天等雨。可是这村农民从来没有抗旱点种的习惯，思想问题没有解决。长林看到光推不动的情形，就想起去年领导群众治棉花害虫的事情来。那时，棉蚜、棉蜘蛛闹得很厉害，幼小的棉苗，受害很重，有些棉蜘蛛为害严重的棉田，猛一看去，棉苗变成了红色。乡里一个会接着一个会，号召群众捕灭虫害，可是都像耳旁风刮过去一样，没有起一点作用。后来，他借了个喷雾器，装上石灰硫磺合剂，到自己的棉田里去作试验。当时看热闹的人很多。有些人光说泄气话：“看这物件能把火龙（红蜘蛛）治下去啦！”可是药水喷撒到棉苗上以后，害虫立时就死了。很多农民都说：“这真美，我也要贷个喷雾器，把害虫治下去。”捕灭棉花害虫运动就这样展开了。长林想到这里，领导群众抗旱点种的信心增强了。他想：“光口头号召不顶事，必须先给大伙开条路。”他和家里人首先担水浇种上一亩二分棉花、二亩高粱。三天后，秋苗出得很齐整。消息传开后，许多农民都到地里去看，谁看看谁眼热。农民赵福玉看到浇种真顶事，当场就向长林讨教浇种的办法。隔了三四天，他见了长林笑着说：“乡长，我浇种的秋苗也出来了！”长林就拿这些事实教育农民抗旱浇水点种，全村农民在这活生生的事实面前，都感到靠天吃饭思想是错误的，很多人都争先恐后地担水点种。
    新的问题又来了。有些春地犁后没有耙，如今遍地都是盆大碗小的泥块块，无法浇种。新的困难并未吓倒余长林，他耐心地去进行个别发动。一天，他跑到农民王文德家，笑着说：“文德，你家的春地为啥还不种？”文德冷冷地说：“满地大泥块，怎样种法？”长林又问：“你家十口人，种那六亩麦，今夏每亩地顶多打二斗，共打一石二斗麦，最多能吃两个月，麦吃完接不住秋可咋办呢？”问得文德大张嘴没啥说。长林接着说：“眼下你家要是能出点力种上二亩高粱，有两、三个月就能接住嘴了，不也饿不着肚子啦！”文德妈插嘴说：“是呀！你看乡长多会打算，咱也应该往后打算打算呀！”可是文德思想还不通，不耐烦地说：“等我爹回来了再说吧！”文德爹等雨的思想很严重，看大伙种上的秋苗都出来了，心里很着急，也想浇种
    一点，但看到泥块太大，又没有信心。长林就动员他说：“种一棵是一棵，种一分是一分”，并提出打碎泥块再种的办法。随后，在长林亲手帮助下，种上了几分地早秋作物。农民代清山的四亩多春地，也是因为泥块大没种上，长林便对他说明“早种早接嘴”的好处，并帮助他下地打泥块，结果担水点种了一亩三分棉花、三亩高粱。当王文德、代清山两家打泥块浇种的事实传出去后，农民们都照样点种上了。全村一百二十亩春地，就这样全部种上了早秋作物。（王祖培）
