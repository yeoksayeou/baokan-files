Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 17th: Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The Panmunjom armistice negotiations are in recess today, but the U.S. propaganda machine is working hard. One cannot help but ask, what are the Americans afraid of?

The U.S. State Department's propaganda machine, United Press, has today cranked up its power, saying that the armistice negotiations have reached a "showdown" stage and are approaching a "breaking point." It is using the secret nature of the delegation plenary session to spread various rumors in an attempt to deceive world opinion. However, it seems that United Press's behind-the-scenes string-puller is pulling the strings too quickly, so that its reporters are incoherent and full of contradictions. A typical example is the notorious rumor-mongering expert, United Press Vice President and Asian Branch Manager Holbrecht, who shamelessly boasts everywhere that he is Syngman Rhee's "longtime friend." In a dispatch he sent from Seoul tonight, he first said that the United Nations forces had submitted a "final memorandum" yesterday, but then said that the United Nations forces were "preparing" to present an "ultimatum." Holbrecht seems to think that the U.S. side has been caught in an embarrassing situation by the repeated questions from the Korean and Chinese side about how the U.S. will guarantee that Syngman Rhee will abide by the armistice agreement. Therefore, his task is to try his best to gloss over the U.S.'s "embarrassing" appearance, and make it sound "very impressive" and "very tough." Thus, one "final memorandum" is not enough, let's have another "ultimatum."

Since the negotiations in Panmunjom are secret, people do not yet know what is happening. But since Holbrecht said that the U.S. is "preparing" to present a "final ultimatum," it is clear that no "final memorandum" was presented yesterday. Holbrecht's purpose in doing this is just like his underling, United Press Tokyo reporter Potts, who insisted that the recess was proposed by Harrison, trying to save face.

People know that since the resumption of the plenary session of the two delegations a week ago, the key issue has been: the U.S. must clarify whether the armistice includes Syngman Rhee's government and army; if it does, then how will the U.S. guarantee that Syngman Rhee's government and army will strictly abide by the armistice agreement. In the joint statement of the Robertson-Syngman Rhee meeting, the words Syngman Rhee "guarantees to abide by the armistice agreement" cannot be found at all. On the contrary, Syngman Rhee openly announced that he "does not accept the armistice." Even today, Choi Duk-shin, who represented Syngman Rhee in the Panmunjom negotiations, still declared his opposition to the armistice agreement. He said at a press conference in Seoul today: "As long as the current armistice terms are not changed, the South Korean government will continue to resist the armistice negotiations." All of this shows how important it is for the realization of the Korean armistice that the Korean and Chinese side insist that the U.S. must clearly answer the above questions.

Originally, the armistice agreement should have been signed long ago. The problem does not lie with the Korean and Chinese side, but only because Syngman Rhee of the U.S. destroyed the prisoner-of-war agreement a month ago, thereby interrupting the preparations for signing the armistice agreement. Similarly, the preparations for signing the agreement should have been restored long ago. The problem is not with the Korean and Chinese side, but only because the U.S. has been slow to provide complete guarantees, thereby delaying the current negotiations. Although the situation inside the Panmunjom conference tent for the past week is still kept secret, it is not difficult for people to see how the U.S. negotiator Harrison was questioned to the point of being speechless, so that he had to ask the State Department's propaganda machine for help. However, neither Potts nor Holbrecht, these rumor-mongering experts, not only cannot help Harrison, but instead helped him with the opposite effect.

### 妄图欺骗世界舆论  美国宣传机器对停战谈判制造种种谣言

    妄图欺骗世界舆论
    美国宣传机器对停战谈判制造种种谣言
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者江南报道：板门店的停战谈判今天休会，但美国的宣传机器倒忙碌起来了。人们不免要问，美国人害怕什么呢？
    美国务院的宣传机器合众社今天开足了马力，说什么停战谈判已到了“摊牌”的阶段，已经接近了“爆发点”。它利用停战谈判代表团大会的秘密性质，散播种种谣言，企图欺骗世界舆论。但是，看来合众社的幕后牵线人是把线拉得太急促了，以致它的记者语无伦次，矛盾百出。典型的例子是臭名远扬的造谣专家合众社副社长兼亚洲分社社长霍布雷奇特，他恬不知耻地到处吹嘘他是李承晚的“多年挚友”。他今晚自汉城发出的电讯中先是说，联合国军方面已在昨天提出了“最后备忘录”，但接着又说，联合国军“准备”提出一个“最后通牒”。霍布雷奇特似乎觉得，在朝中方面一再质询美方如何保证李承晚遵守停战协定的情况下，美方已陷于狼狈不堪的境地，因此他的任务是尽力粉饰美方的“尴尬”相，把它说成是“很神气”、“很强硬”，于是，一个“最后备忘录”还不够，再来一个“最后通牒”。
    由于板门店的谈判是秘密性的，人们还不知道内情怎样。但霍布雷奇特既然说美方“准备”提出一个“最后    通牒”，可见昨天没有提出什么“最后备忘录”。霍布雷奇特这样做的目的，只不过是像他的手下喽啰合众社驻东京记者波茨硬说休会是哈利逊提出的一样，打肿脸充胖子而已。
    人们知道，双方代表团大会自一个星期前重开以来，关键的问题是：美方必须澄清停战是否包括李承晚的政府和军队在内；如果包括在内，那末美方如何保证李承晚的政府和军队严格遵守停战协定。在罗伯逊和李承晚会谈的联合声明中，根本找不到李承晚“保证遵守停战协定”这些字，反之李承晚公开宣布他“不接受停战”。甚至直到今天，曾代表李承晚参加板门店谈判的崔德新还声明反对停战协定。他今天在汉城举行记者招待会时说：“只要目前的停战条款不改变，韩国政府就继续抵制停战谈判。”这一切都说明，朝中方面坚持美方必须明确回答上述的问题对朝鲜停战的实现具有多么重大的意义。
    本来，停战协定早该签订了，问题不在于朝中方面，而仅仅是因为美方的李承晚在一个月以前破坏了战俘协议，从而打断了有关签订停战协定的准备工作。同样的，签订协定的准备工作早该重新恢复了，问题也不在朝中方面，而仅仅是因为美方迟迟没有提出完全的保证，从而拖延了目前的谈判。虽然一周来板门店会议帐篷内的情形迄今还是秘而不宣，但人们不难看出美方谈判代表哈利逊被质询得怎样理屈词穷，以致他不得不向国务院的宣传机器求救。但是，不论波茨或者霍布雷奇特，这些造谣专家们非但不能帮助哈利逊，反而替他帮了倒忙。
