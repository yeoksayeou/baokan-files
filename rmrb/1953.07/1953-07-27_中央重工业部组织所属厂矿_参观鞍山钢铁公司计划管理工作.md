    Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Organizes Factories and Mines to Visit Anshan Iron and Steel Company to Study Planned Management Work

    The Production Technology Department of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, in order to promote the planned management work of its subordinate factories and mines, organized cadres from twenty-nine units to visit Anshan Iron and Steel Company from late May to early June. This visit has played a certain role in promoting the planned management work of various factories and mines.

    During the visit, Anshan Iron and Steel Company gave five reports on planned management to various factories and mines. At the same time, the Production Department systematically introduced operation planning and dispatch work, the Mechanical Department introduced planned maintenance work, the Medium-Sized Rolling Mill introduced the preparation method of operation plans, and the Chemical Plant introduced the method of maintenance according to instruction charts. Cadres from various factories and mines visited the company's central dispatch room and the dispatch rooms of ironmaking, steelmaking and other plants, and participated in the company's production dispatch telephone conference.

    Through visits and specific introductions to planned management experience, various units learned how to use scientific management methods to manage production, gained a relatively clear and systematic understanding of operation planning and dispatch work, and at the same time, discovered the shortcomings of their own factories and mines in carrying out these tasks. Yu Wen, director of the Fifth Cement Plant, after seeing the planned management work of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, felt that in his own plant only the lower levels were acting, and the upper levels were not paying attention. The dispatch organization had been established, and the work system and responsibilities had been formulated, but the leadership had not paid close attention. He expressed his determination to learn the methods of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, take action himself, and strengthen the leadership of dispatch work.

    Through the visit, some erroneous ideas were clarified. Zhao Bingran, deputy director of Hua Copper Mine, said that there had been a lot of debate in the past about whether mines could carry out dispatch work. Some people believed that mines were too scattered to carry out dispatch work, and he himself was not sure. This time, he personally saw that such a complex unit as Anshan Iron and Steel Company could also do a good job in dispatch work, and he had confidence in establishing dispatch work in the mine. Many units originally emphasized that there should be many conditions for planned management. Some people said that to do dispatch work, there must be engineers, or at least technicians. Some people said that to carry out operation planning, there must be enough cranes, pits, steel ladles, etc., otherwise the plan could not be executed even if it was prepared. The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company corrected these views. They realized that at the beginning, it was not required that the plan be 100% accurate, as long as it was established and adhered to, and constantly revised and constantly overcome the weak links in production, it could gradually become accurate.

    Through the visit, various units learned the specific practices of preparing operation plans and establishing dispatch organizations. The various bureaus have formulated some working regulations and drafts based on the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the opinions of various factories.

### 中央重工业部组织所属厂矿  参观鞍山钢铁公司计划管理工作

    中央重工业部组织所属厂矿
    参观鞍山钢铁公司计划管理工作
    中央重工业部生产技术司，为了推动所属各厂矿的计划管理工作，在五月下旬至六月初，组织二十九个单位的干部到鞍山钢铁公司参观。这次参观对于各厂矿的计划管理工作起了一定的推动作用。
    参观期间，鞍钢向各厂矿作了五个有关计划管理的报告，同时，生产处系统地介绍了作业计划和调度工作，机械处介绍了计划检修工作，中型轧钢厂介绍了作业计划的编制方法，化工总厂介绍了按指示图表进行检修的方法。各厂矿的干部参观了公司的总调度室和炼铁、炼钢等厂的调度室，参加了公司的生产调度电话会议。
    通过参观和具体地介绍计划管理经验，使各单位知道了应该如何运用科学管理方法来管理生产，对作业计划和调度工作有了比较明确比较系统的认识，同时，发现了自己厂矿在进行这些工作中的缺点。第五水泥厂厂长于文看了鞍钢的计划管理工作后，感到自己厂里只是下面动了，上面并没抓紧，调度组织建立起来了，工作制度和职责条例订出来了，但是领导方面却没有抓紧；表示一定学习鞍钢的方法，亲自动手，加强对调度工作的领导。
    通过参观，澄清了一些错误想法，华铜铜矿副矿长赵炳然说，矿山能不能搞调度，过去曾有很多争论。有人认为矿山分散，不能搞调度，自己也捉摸不定。这次亲眼看到鞍钢这样复杂的单位，也能搞好调度工作，对于在矿山建立调度工作有了信心。许多单位原来强调搞计划管理要有许多条件。有人说，搞调度要有工程师，至少也得技术员。有人说，要搞作业计划就得有足够的吊车、地坑、钢水罐等，否则编了计划也不能执行。鞍钢的经验纠正了这些看法，他们认识到开始时并不要求计划能百分之百的准确，只要建立起来坚持下去，不断修正、不断克服生产中的薄弱环节，就可能逐步准确起来。
    通过参观，各单位学到了编制作业计划和建立调度机构的具体作法。各局已根据鞍钢的经验和各厂的意见，拟定一些工作条例和草案。
