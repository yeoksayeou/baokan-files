The people who have experienced the disasters of war understand the value and loveliness of peace most deeply. When the days without the sound of airplanes and cannons began to arrive in Korea, what I saw was the joy of the people in the Kaesong area – a joy that is difficult to express in words. The people here like to express their happiness with dance. An old woman with half-white hair who lives next door to us now starts to sway and dance as she talks to people. Every family made large and small national flags on the first night without the sound of airplanes and cannons – the night of July 27th. Men, women, old and young, each had one flag, and they also hung one on the door. Some families hung many flags inside and outside the house. Those who had cloth used cloth, and those who didn't use paper. I don't know where all these colorful cloths and papers came from. The workers in the factories rushed to make models of their factories and products, and made carrying frames or trolleys. The farmers found tall poles with pheasant feathers tied to the top, which were the solemn flagpoles they had used since ancient times to carry large flags. The people from the ginseng cooperative rushed to make huge models of ginseng branches, leaves, and roots. Ancient Korean gongs, drums, and trumpets sounded, and male and female students and children prepared their neatest clothes, wreaths, colorful hats, stationery, and portraits of leaders overnight. Some women dressed up at night: applying powder, drawing their eyebrows, and wearing bright long skirts of pink, egg blue, and as colorful as peacock tails, which dragged from their chests all the way to the ground.

The next day – the morning of the 28th, the streets and alleys were crowded with people wearing new clothes. Farmers from Panmun County and Kaepung County gathered with the citizens of Kaesong on various roads and poured into a square. Everything prepared at night appeared on the roads and in the square. Behind the flags and models of the spinning factory, a gorgeously dressed female worker sat on a loom, followed by the cloth they produced. The workers at the shoe factory pushed a several-foot-long model of a leather shoe. The workers at the iron factory waved various farming tools such as sickles. At the front of the Yunheung-ri farmers' team, a boy wearing a woman's red skirt danced gracefully on the shoulders of an adult. The drum band wore large rain-hat-style festival hats made of straw or cardboard, adorned with large flowers or clusters of colored streamers, or stacks of large flower paper. Groups of farmers danced rhythmically.

When Premier Kim Il-sung's loud voice was transmitted from Pyongyang to Kaesong, it was 12:00 noon Korean time. The sun was scorching in the square, but people were still densely packed together listening, from time to time bursting out with mountain torrent-like roars of "Long live!", waving giant portraits of Kim Il-sung, Malenkov, Mao Zedong... and huge slogans paying tribute to these people's leaders, singing the songs of peace fighters, the song of Kim Il-sung...

Then, the parade of tens of thousands of people celebrating the armistice began. Turning to the Nandaemun Gate, the center point of the parade, and looking out along the street, there was an endless stream of people, flowers, and colorful flags. The children's teams performed various neat actions and sang the Young Pioneers' song loudly in unison. The women danced gracefully in the marching ranks, much like the Chinese Yangko dance. An old worker named Li Wanxing, with fourteen years of service at the power plant, explained their joy, saying: "This is not only because of the armistice, but also because Kaesong is no longer living under the feet of the Rhee Syngman army and the American invading army as it was three years ago. It is now a city of the people." He summarized his previous life by saying: "At that time, I was a servant who could be deprived of my livelihood at any time and who was called upon by others." And now? He said: "Under the leadership of the People's Government, for the first time in my life, I feel that I am the master of the factory. I am respected and loved." His narration reminded me of a citizen's recollection some time ago. This citizen said that when the negotiations began two years ago, the masses constantly stopped the cars of the Chinese and Korean negotiators, and with tears in their eyes, they told them: Never let Kaesong be handed over to the enemy. Now, their many years of wishes have finally become a reality, and the blood of thousands of martyrs who died in Kaesong has finally nurtured the flowers of victory. The families of guerrilla heroes are no longer persecuted, women will no longer be subjected to the humiliation of beasts, children will grow up like flowers after the rain under the beautiful red flag, farmers no longer have to hand over more than half of their harvests to the landlords, workers no longer have to worry about unemployment and hunger, and citizens no longer have to specially prepare unpaid night meals for Rhee Syngman's police and endure scolding and anger in the dead of night. How could they not be happy? How could they not dance and sing? An old woman holding two national flags in her hands danced and said: "Liberated, liberated, good days are coming!"

When night came, Li Wanxing and his power plant workers used their hands to make the streets and buildings emit light that had not been seen in three years. On the Nandaemun Gate, whose tower had been destroyed, rows of electric lights illuminated rows of flags, and also illuminated the large ancient bell that was hundreds of years old. In the fountain under the city gate, silvery-white water sprayed out. In various clubs and squares, films such as "The Road to Glory" began to be shown. The streets flowed with joyful crowds. The street lights illuminated people's smiling faces and festive clothes. For the people of Kaesong, what a lovely night this was! They will never forget it.

Today, the people of Kaesong, in response to Premier Kim Il-sung's call, have begun to plan to prosper their city and their motherland by restoring production and increasing production. The Kaesong City Committee of the Workers' Party and the City People's Committee are actively arranging and leading this movement. However, they have not lowered their political vigilance in the slightest because of this.

### 开城人民的喜悦

    开城人民的喜悦
    本报特派记者　林韦
    经受过战争灾祸的人民，最懂得和平之可贵与可爱。当没有飞机大炮声音的时日开始来到朝鲜的时候，我看到的是开城地区人民的喜悦——难于用言语表达的喜悦。这里的人民喜欢用舞蹈来表达自己的快乐。我们门边住着的一位头发半白的老太婆，现在和人说话时，说着说着就一摆一摆地舞起来了。所有的家庭，都在第一个没有了飞机大炮声的夜晚—七月二十七日的夜晚，做了大大小小的国旗。男女老少，每人一面，门上还要挂一面。有的人家屋里屋外挂了好多面。有布的用布做，没有布的用纸做。这许多各色的布和纸，不知是从那个角落里钻出来的。工厂的工人们，赶制了自己工厂的模型，产物的模型，赶制了抬架或推车。农民们找出了顶端系着野鸡毛的高竿，这是他们自古以来用以扛大旗的隆重的旗竿。人蔘组合的人们赶制了巨大的人蔘枝叶和根的模型。古代传下来的朝鲜式锣鼓和喇叭响了起来，男女学生们和孩子们，连夜准备了最整洁的衣服、花环、彩帽、文具和领袖像。妇女们有的在夜里就打扮起来：擦了粉，画了眉，着了粉红色、蛋青色和花得像孔雀尾一样的艳丽的长裙，从胸部一直拖到脚面上。
    第二天——二十八日的清晨，大街小巷都拥塞着穿新衣的人群。来自板门郡和开丰郡的农民，和开城的市民在各处道路上汇集起来，涌到一个广场。夜里准备好的一切，都出现在道路上和广场上。纺绳工厂的大旗和模型后面，织机上坐着一个衣着花丽的女工，后面拖着她们生产的布匹。鞋工厂的工人们推着几尺长的皮鞋模型。铁工厂的工人挥舞着镰刀之类的各式农具。云鹤里农民队伍的最前面是一个男孩子穿着女人的红裙站在大人肩上翩翩欢舞。鼓乐队戴着稻草或硬纸做成的大雨帽式的过节帽，上面缀着大朵的鲜花或一簇簇的彩色条纸，或一叠叠的大片花纸。一群一群的农民有节奏地跳着。
    金日成首相嘹亮的声音从平壤传到开城的时候，是朝鲜时间中午十二点。广场上炎阳烧灼着，人们还是那样密集在一起倾听，不时发出山洪一样“万岁”的巨响，挥动着金日成、马林科夫、毛泽东……的巨像和向这些人民领袖们致敬的巨幅标语，唱起和平斗士之歌，金日成之歌……。
    然后，庆祝停战的数万人的大游行开始了。转到游行的中心点南大门上，顺着大街望出去，是流不尽的人群、花丛和彩色的旗帜。小孩们的队伍，表演着各种整齐的动作，高声齐唱着少年团的歌。妇女们在行进的行列里翩翩地舞着，很像是中国的秧歌舞。发电厂一个名叫李万兴的工龄十四年的老工人解释他们的喜悦说：“这不仅是因为停战，而且因为开城已经不是像三年以前一样活在李伪军和美国侵略军的脚下，她现在是人民的城市了。”他概括他以前的生活说：“那时候我是一个随时可以被夺去饭眢的由人家呼唤的仆役。”现在呢？他说：“在人民政府领导下，我平生第一次感到我是工厂的主人。我受人尊敬，受人爱护。”他的叙述，使我联想起前些时一个市民的回忆。这个市民说，两年前谈判开始的时候，群众不断地拦住朝中方面谈判人员的车子，含着眼泪嘱咐他们：千万不能把开城让给敌人。如今，他们多少年的愿望终于变成了现实，开城数千死难烈士的血终于培育出胜利的鲜花。游击队英雄们的家属不再遭受迫害了，妇女们不会再遭受野兽们的凌辱了，孩子们将像雨后的花朵一样在美丽的红旗下成长，农民们不必再把一半以上的收获物交给地主，工人们不必再愁失业与饥饿，市民们也不必再在深夜里给李承晚的警察特备无报酬的夜餐和挨骂受气了。他们怎能不快乐？怎能不欢舞高歌？一个两手拿着两面国旗的老大娘一面欢舞，一面说：“解放了，解放了，好日子来了！”
    夜晚到来的时候，李万兴和他的电厂工友们的手使街道和建筑物上发出三年来没有过的亮光。被炸毁了城楼的南大门上，一排排的电灯照明了一排排的旗帜，也照明了那口数百年的大古钟。城门下的喷水池中，喷出银白色的水花。在各个俱乐部和各处广场上，“光荣之路”等影片开始放映。街头流动着欢乐的人群。街灯照耀着人们的笑脸和节日的衣裙。对于开城人民，这是一个多么可爱的夜晚呀！他们将永生不会遗忘。
    今天，开城人民响应金日成首相的号召，开始计划以恢复生产、增加生产来繁荣自己的城市和自己的祖国。劳动党开城市委和市人民委员会正积极布置和领导这一运动。但是，他们并没有因此而丝毫降低了政治的警惕性。
        一九五三年七月二十九日，开城
