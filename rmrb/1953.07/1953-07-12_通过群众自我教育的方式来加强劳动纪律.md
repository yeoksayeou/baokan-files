	Strengthening Labor Discipline Through Mass Self-Education

	In the worker masses, conducting criticism and self-criticism under leadership is an effective way to combine theory with practice in labor discipline education and strengthen labor discipline. The transformations of Tianjin workers Li Zhiping, Wang Xiuzhen, and Wang Shuqin fully illustrate this point. Reading their self-criticisms leaves a deep impression: enlightened workers are so courageous in self-criticism, daring to expose their shortcomings and erroneous thoughts, and resolutely correcting them once they recognize them. According to the Tianjin Daily, Wang Xiuzhen has already fulfilled the guarantees she made in her self-criticism. In June, she didn't take a single day off or miss work, and her output reached an average of 2,000 packs of cigarettes per day. For the first time in over a year, she consistently fulfilled her production plan daily. Yesterday, this newspaper published the exemplary deeds of Gong Wenfa and others in consciously abiding by labor discipline, which can encourage everyone to learn from them. Today's publication of the self-criticisms of Li Zhiping and others can encourage everyone to be brave in self-criticism and criticism, striving for common progress. Combining these two methods will more effectively promote and establish a solid, conscious labor discipline.

	Why should the development of self-criticism and criticism be led? What does it mean to be led?

	Some factory trade unions have already issued calls to workers to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Trade union groups have also held meetings. At these meetings, almost everyone engaged in self-criticism. But what did they criticize? One said, "In the past, I didn't pay enough attention to operating procedures, and I will correct this in the future." Another said, "Last time, I cursed Old Li during working hours, which was wrong." Yet another said, "I'm playful and like to take leave, which has delayed production. I hope everyone will help me correct me." It is obvious that such self-criticism lacks leadership, is undirected, and is merely a formality. Of course, if leadership is neglected, and only general calls for criticism and self-criticism are made, examining past violations of labor discipline, results even worse than the above generalization may occur. For example, getting entangled in trivial private life issues, or whoever boldly criticizes themselves first becomes the target of everyone's attack, becoming the object of struggle, unable to hold their head up, and becoming an outcast, hindering the development of criticism and self-criticism, allowing individuals who are unwilling to correct their mistakes and who more seriously violate labor discipline to slip through the cracks. Therefore, in order for criticism and self-criticism to achieve good results, there must be leadership.

	Having leadership is first reflected in the purposefulness of carrying out such criticism and self-criticism. It is necessary to educate workers on labor discipline and mobilize the consciousness of the worker masses. This requires the leadership to first clearly recognize that past laxity in labor discipline is not the fault of the workers, but mainly due to ideological problems among the leading cadres. Therefore, in the minds of our leading cadres, there should not be any contemptuous or punitive sentiments towards workers who generally violate labor discipline. We must believe that as long as they are educated, the vast majority of workers will consciously correct their shortcomings. Through mass criticism and self-criticism, each worker will not feel any shame or be punished. Instead, they will feel relieved, happy, more confident, more enthusiastic, and able to consciously correct their past shortcomings. This spirit must be understood by cadres above the group leader level, Party members, and Youth League members in order to carry out criticism and self-criticism under leadership in a healthy manner.

	The leadership we are talking about is not merely a general appeal, but requires thorough and meticulous work to cultivate typical figures, and through the criticism of the behavior and thoughts of typical figures, to educate all the masses. For example, Wang Xiuzhen's self-criticism can represent those who are content with the status quo, seek pleasure, and are influenced by the bourgeois idea of living without working. By unfolding discussions around their thinking, the problems of workers with this type of thinking can be profoundly resolved. If representative ideas of those who violate labor discipline are found among peasants or handicraft workers with the characteristics of small-scale producers, or among young workers, the ideological problems of the majority can be resolved through discussions of three, five, or more typical figures. In order to cultivate such typical figures, it is necessary to study the different situations among workers, discover suitable targets, analyze the thinking of the targets, patiently conduct individual education, help the targets recognize their mistakes, and have the courage to conduct thorough self-criticism, and have the determination and confidence to correct their shortcomings.

	To have leadership, it is necessary to give appropriate and enthusiastic encouragement to workers who bravely conduct self-criticism and boldly expose shortcomings, point out the direction of their efforts, and help them overcome their shortcomings. And it is necessary to be good at expanding their influence, studying the reactions of other workers in the whole group and workshop after hearing the self-criticisms of typical figures, promoting others to consciously participate in criticism and self-criticism, and gradually forming an atmosphere in which everyone is brave in criticism and self-criticism. For those who have made progress after self-criticism, even if it is very small progress, it should be encouraged in a timely manner.

	To have leadership, when the masses have already carried out criticism and self-criticism, it is necessary to carefully study and analyze the ideological problems exposed by the worker masses, find the ideological roots from many violations of labor discipline, and help everyone improve their understanding in a timely manner, so that criticism and self-criticism do not become repetitive and similar self-criticisms. For example, in discussing Wang Xiuzhen's self-criticism, it is necessary to focus on drawing a clear line between the working class's idea that labor is glorious and labor creates happiness, and the bourgeois idea of ​​seeking ease and avoiding work and living without working. Furthermore, it is necessary to link this to many specific labor discipline issues, such as strengthening organization, abiding by operating procedures, correctly treating cultural and entertainment activities, and opposing extreme democratization, and so on. If the leadership is not good, a typical example cannot exert its due educational role; if the leadership is good, it can become a vivid education. Leading cadres should also learn lessons from the materials that everyone criticizes, in order to improve political work and improve production management work.

	Some individuals who violate labor discipline, either have hooligan habits, or come from exploiting classes and have not been reformed, or even have mixed into the ranks of workers to deliberately sabotage production. After mass criticism and self-criticism is carried out, although some of these people will change under the pressure of the masses, not all of them will necessarily change. Therefore, the leadership should also be good at exposing their true faces, placing them under the supervision of the masses, so that they dare not act recklessly anymore and honestly transform themselves through labor. If they continue to disrupt labor discipline, they should be given necessary punishments.

### 通过群众自我教育的方式来加强劳动纪律

    通过群众自我教育的方式来加强劳动纪律
    在工人群众中，有领导地开展批评和自我批评，是结合实际进行劳动纪律教育，加强劳动纪律的有效办法。天津工人李志苹、王秀珍、王淑琴三个人的转变，充分说明了这一点。我们读了她们三人的自我检讨，都会留下一个深刻的印象：觉悟了的工人，是多么勇于自我批评，敢于暴露自己的缺点和错误思想，并且在认识到它之后，马上就坚决改正。据天津日报载，王秀珍已经实现了自己在检讨中所提出的保证，在六月份里，就没有请过一次假，没有旷过一次工，产量达到平均每天包两千包烟。一年多以来，她第一次做到了能够经常地每天完成生产计划。昨天本报发表的宫文发等自觉遵守劳动纪律的模范事迹，可以鼓励大家努力向他们学习；今天发表的李志苹等的检讨，又可以鼓励大家，勇于自我批评和批评，来求得共同的进步。两种方法结合起来，就会更有效地推动和树立起巩固的自觉的劳动纪律。
    为什么开展自我批评和批评要有领导呢？怎样才叫有领导呢？
    有的工厂工会，已经向工人发出过号召，要开展批评和自我批评。工会小组也开过会了。会上，几乎每个人都检讨过了。可是，检讨了些什么呢？这个说：“我过去注意操作规程不够，以后要改正”，那个说：“上次我在工作时间，骂了老李一句，太不应该”，另一个说：“我贪玩，好请假，耽误了生产，希望大家帮助我改正”。像这样的检讨，一望而知，是没有什么领导的，是自流的，是形式的。当然，如果不注意领导，只是泛泛地提出开展批评和自我批评，检查过去违犯劳动纪律的现象，还可能发生比上面这种一般化更糟糕的结果。比如纠缠到许多私生活的琐碎问题上去，或者谁先大胆检讨了，却成为众矢之的，成了斗争的对象，抬不起头来，见不得人，反而阻碍了批评和自我批评的开展，而使个别不愿改正错误的人、更严重地违犯劳动纪律的人，钻空子混了过去。所以为了使批评和自我批评能得到好的效果，必须有领导。
    有领导，首先表现在开展这种批评和自我批评的目的性上，要经过认真的劳动纪律的教育，发动工人群众的自觉性。这就必须在领导方面首先明确认识到，过去劳动纪律松懈，不怪工人，主要是由于领导干部有许多思想问题。所以我们领导干部的思想上，不能对一般违犯劳动纪律的工人，存在一点瞧不起或者打击的情绪。要相信，只要经过教育，绝大多数工人都会自觉地改正缺点。经过群众性的批评和自我批评，每个工人不但不会感到一点耻辱、打击；反而感到放下了包袱，痛快了，信心更足，热情更高，能自觉地去改正过去的缺点。这种精神，要使小组长以上的干部、党员、团员都能懂得，才会使开展批评和自我批评有领导地健康地开展起来。
    我们说的领导当然不是泛泛的一般号召，而是要经过深入细致的工作，培养出典型人物来，通过对典型人物的行为和思想的批判，去教育所有的群众。比如王秀珍的检讨，可以代表满足现状、贪图享受、受到资产阶级不劳而食的思想影响的人。围绕他的思想展开讨论，就可以深刻地解决带有这一类型思想的工人的问题。如果在具有小生产者思想特点的农民或手工业工人中，或者是青年工人中，找出代表他们违犯劳动纪律的思想，就可以通过三、五个典型人物的讨论，来解决大多数人的思想问题。为了培养这样的典型人物，就要研究工人中不同的情况，发现合适的对象，分析对象的思想，耐心地进行个别教育，帮助对象认识自己的错误，并有勇气进行彻底的自我批评，有决心和信心改正自己的缺点。
    要有领导，就要对于勇敢地进行自我批评、大胆暴露缺点的工人，进行适当的热诚的鼓励，给他指出努力的方向，帮助他克服缺点。并且要善于扩大他的影响，研究全组、全车间其他工人听了典型人物检讨之后的反映，推动别人自觉地参加批评和自我批评，逐渐形成大家都勇于批评和自我批评的风气。对于检讨之后有了进步的人，那怕是很小的进步，也要及时予以鼓励。
    要有领导，就要在群众已经开展批评和自我批评的时候，认真研究和分析工人群众所暴露出来的思想问题，从许多违犯劳动纪律的行为和思想里，找到思想根源，及时帮助大家提高认识，不要使批评和自我批评，变成重复彼此相似的检讨。比如，在讨论王秀珍的检讨中，要着重划清工人阶级劳动光荣、劳动创造幸福的思想和资产阶级好逸恶劳、不劳而食的思想界限，进一步联系到许多具体的劳动纪律问题，如加强组织性、遵守操作规程、正确对待文化娱乐、反对极端民主化，等等。如果领导不好，一个典型就不能发挥它的应有的教育作用；领导得好，就可能成为生动的教育。领导干部也要从大家检讨的材料中，找到教训，来改进政治工作，改进生产管理工作。
    有些个别违犯劳动纪律的人，或者是流氓成性的，或者是剥削阶级出身未经过改造的，甚至是混进工人队伍中来存心破坏生产的。当群众性的批评和自我批评开展之后，这些人虽则有的会在群众压力之下转变，但并不一定都会转变。所以领导方面也要善于揭发他们的真面目，把他们放在群众监督之下，使他们不敢再胡作非为，老老实实地从劳动中去改造自己。他们如果继续破坏劳动纪律，就要给予必要的处分。
