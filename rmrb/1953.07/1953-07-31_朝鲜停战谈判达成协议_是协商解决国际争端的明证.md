    The Korean Armistice Agreement is Clear Evidence of Negotiated Resolution of International Disputes

    Ma Changyi of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union writes: The staff of our bureau were very happy to hear the news that the Korean armistice negotiations had reached a full agreement. Everyone believes that the signing of the armistice agreement is the result of the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world and the persistent struggle of the heroic Korean and Chinese people. The conclusion of the armistice negotiations proves the infinite power of the forces of peace and democracy. However, everyone also expressed that whether the agreement can be effectively observed and implemented will depend on the future actions of the United States; therefore, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance.

    The conclusion of this agreement shows that the attempts of international adventurers to believe that force can rule everything cannot succeed, and only peaceful consultation is the way to resolve all international disputes. Although the armistice agreement has been signed, this is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean and Chinese people have made consistent and unwavering efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue in the past, and will continue to work tirelessly to the end until the Korean issue is resolved fairly and reasonably through peaceful means.

### 朝鲜停战谈判达成协议  是协商解决国际争端的明证

专栏：读者来信摘要

    朝鲜停战谈判达成协议
    是协商解决国际争端的明证
    北京电信局工会马昌仪来信：我局职工听到了朝鲜停战谈判完全达成协议的消息后，大家都感到很高兴。大家认为：停战协定的签订，是全世界爱好和平的人民的努力以及英勇的朝中人民坚持奋斗的结果。停战谈判达成协议证明了和平民主力量的无限强大。但是，大家都表示：协议是否能被切实遵守和执行，还要看美国方面今后的行动；因此，我们还必须要保持高度的警惕。
    这次协议的达成，说明了国际冒险家们迷信武力能统治一切的企图是不能得逞的，只有和平协商才是解决一切国际争端的办法。停战协定虽已签字，但这只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。我们朝中人民过去为和平解决朝鲜问题作了一贯的坚定不移的努力，今后仍旧要坚持不懈地努力到底，直到朝鲜问题达到公平合理的和平解决为止。
