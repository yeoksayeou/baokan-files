    This spring, in the Dongdi area of the Third District of Anshan City, during basic construction earthmoving and the building of workers' dormitories, a Han tomb complex and ancient kiln site totaling more than two hundred were discovered. The majority of the Han tombs are brick tombs, and there are also stone tombs of varying shapes. The brick tomb chambers are ingeniously constructed with different bricklaying methods; the bricklaying method of the tomb floor, in particular, has its own unique characteristics. In order to preserve the historical sites, the Cultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee organized archaeological personnel from various museums in May to assist the relevant departments of Anshan City in clearing the sites. Fifteen brick tombs and three stone tombs have now been cleared. Among the unearthed items are complete sets of Mingqi (ceramic stoves, ceramic pots, ceramic steamers, etc.) in perfect condition, as well as finely crafted ceramic bowls, ceramic urns, ear cups, ceramic houses, and women's ornaments such as glass earrings and copper finger rings. Almost every tomb contained Wushu coins and Huo Quan coins from the Wang Mang era. Recently, another ancient kiln site with a relatively complete form was discovered at the foot of Ling Mountain, east of the ancient tomb complex, and it has been preliminarily identified as a kiln site from before the Liao and Jin dynasties. This is the first kiln site discovered in Northeast China. The discovery of the ancient tomb complex and ancient kiln site provides valuable materials for studying the history of Northeast China and the development of production and culture and art of the ancient working people.

    鞍山市发现古窑址和汉墓群
    鞍山市第三区东地一带，今春在进行基本建设取土和建筑工人宿舍时，发现汉墓群和古窑址共二百余座，大部汉墓为砖墓，并有形制不同的石墓。砖墓墓室结构精巧，砌法不同，尤其墓底砖的砌法，各有特点。东北行政委员会文化局为了保存古迹，在五月间组织了各地博物馆考古人员协助鞍山市有关方面进行清理，现已清理出十五座砖墓和三座石墓。出土物中有保存完整的成套明器（陶灶、陶釜、陶甑等）及做工精细的陶钵、陶瓮、耳杯、陶房以及妇女的装饰品琉璃质的耳铛和铜指环等。每个墓里几乎都有五铢钱和王莽时代的货泉。古墓群东侧灵山下最近又发现古窑址一处，形制较完整，初步鉴定认为是辽金以前的窑址。这是东北第一次发现的窑址。古墓群和古代窑址的发现，对研究东北的历史和古代劳动人民生产与文化艺术发展情况提供了珍贵的资料。
