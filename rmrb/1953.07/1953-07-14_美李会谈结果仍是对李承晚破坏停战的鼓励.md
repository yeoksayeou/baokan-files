Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 13th (Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) - Today it is even clearer: The result of the Robertson-Rhee talks not only failed to provide a clear guarantee for the implementation of the armistice agreement, but also planted a time bomb for the Korean armistice.

Syngman Rhee declared today that his goal of "unifying Korea" "will never change." At the same time, Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, said it even more bluntly, saying, "Our position remains to oppose the conclusion of an armistice agreement under the current armistice terms," and "We cannot, in principle, accept an armistice that is so dangerous to us." He said that the Syngman Rhee government will never publicly declare its support for the armistice under any circumstances, nor will it participate in the signing ceremony of the armistice agreement in Panmunjom. He said that Syngman Rhee only conditionally agreed not to obstruct the armistice but still "retains the right to act independently."

People can see it no clearer than this. Robertson's so-called "assurance of Syngman Rhee's cooperation with the armistice" isn't even a worthless check. In fact, the words "armistice agreement" cannot be found at all in the joint statement of Robertson and Syngman Rhee, let alone Syngman Rhee's guarantee to abide by the armistice agreement.

Under the watchful eyes of the world, Robertson feels that Syngman Rhee has agreed not to obstruct the armistice within ninety days, and he can now report back. However, this is simply deceiving children, simply treating the armistice as child's play. The U.S. side itself also knows that the armistice is not a ninety-day truce, but a complete cessation of hostilities and all armed actions in Korea by both sides, pending the attainment of a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is clearly stipulated in the preamble to the draft armistice agreement that has already been agreed upon by both sides. Syngman Rhee only promised not to obstruct the armistice within ninety days, which shows that he not only does not intend to implement the armistice agreement, but also intends to undermine the armistice. The U.S. government agreed to Syngman Rhee's agreement not to obstruct the armistice within ninety days, which shows that it not only violates the provisions of the armistice agreement, but also agrees that Syngman Rhee can undermine the armistice after ninety days.

Syngman Rhee has declared that after ninety days, if the political conference has not made a decision to unify Korea that satisfies him, he will act alone. This means that Syngman Rhee has plotted to undermine the political conference, set a time limit for the political conference, so that the political conference is not a place for consultation among the parties concerned, but to force other parties to accept Syngman Rhee's ambitious plan. Syngman Rhee also knows that the Korean and Chinese sides will not accept his arrogant and unreasonable demands, and his purpose is to undermine the political conference in order to resume the war. The U.S. government agreed to Syngman Rhee's opinion and promised to consider any action to be taken at that time, which violates the provisions of the armistice agreement, because the agreement did not give the political conference a time limit. Now, Syngman Rhee only allows non-obstruction of the armistice within ninety days, then what will happen after ninety days, when Syngman Rhee's government and army "act alone"? Will the U.S. side not restrain them? If the U.S. side does not restrain them, how can Korea maintain the armistice? If restraint is to be added, what effective measures is the U.S. side prepared to take to make the Syngman Rhee government and army abide by the armistice agreement?

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 13th (Special Correspondent Wu Min) - The world's attention is focused on a major issue: What degree of assurance is the U.S. government prepared to offer that Syngman Rhee's government and troops will implement the terms of the armistice if the armistice agreement is signed? The joint communique of Robertson and Syngman Rhee contains no affirmative guarantee that the Syngman Rhee government will implement the terms of the armistice. This fact further increases the importance of this issue. This question must be answered in the conference room.

The contradictory statements of Syngman Rhee and Robertson indicate that there are other things in their communique, and explain why Harrison must answer some questions that are decisive for the implementation of the armistice agreement.

So far, actions, even words, are not enough. The Robertson-Rhee communique even further undermines the prisoner-of-war agreement, which states: "At the end of a certain period, all prisoners who wish to avoid returning to Communist rule should be released in South Korea."

People's doubts about whether the United States is sincere in fully implementing the terms of the armistice have been deepened by Syngman Rhee's statement. After the release of the Robertson-Rhee joint statement, Robertson tried his best to promote that he had obtained Syngman Rhee's guarantee to abide by the terms of the armistice. But Syngman Rhee's statement is equivalent to dropping a time bomb in the political conference. Syngman Rhee told American reporters that he had reached an understanding with Robertson that he would continue to obstruct the armistice after ninety days. His Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, said on the 11th: "We cannot in principle accept an armistice that is so dangerous to us." The "friendly understanding" between Robertson and Syngman Rhee is an ominous sign for the future of the armistice.

The so-called continuing to obstruct the armistice after ninety days proves that the U.S. government is still continuing to condone Syngman Rhee's undermining of the armistice agreement, because the armistice agreement does not place a time limit on the armistice. The preamble to the armistice agreement stipulates: The commanders of both sides "guarantee the cessation of hostilities and all armed actions in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is reached."

All these signs indicate that Syngman Rhee is still a serious threat to the armistice, because the United States' attitude towards strict adherence to all the terms of the armistice agreement is ambiguous and equivocal.

### 美李会谈结果仍是对李承晚破坏停战的鼓励

    美李会谈结果仍是对李承晚破坏停战的鼓励
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：今天已经可以看得更清楚：罗伯逊和李承晚会谈的结果，不但使停战协定的实施未得到明确保障，反而为朝鲜停战埋下了一颗定时炸弹。
    李承晚今天发表声明说，他的“统一朝鲜”的目标“决不改变”。同时，李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰说得更露骨，他说，“我们的立场仍然是反对按照目前的停战条款缔结停战协定”，“我们在原则上不能接受对我们这样危险的一种停战。”他说，李承晚政府在任何情况下决不公开声明支持停战，也不参加板门店的停战协定签字仪式，他说，李承晚只是有条件地同意不阻挠停战，但仍“保有独立行动的权利”。
    人们从这里看得再清楚也没有了，罗伯逊所说的李承晚“对停战合作的保证”，连一张空头支票也说不上。事实上，在罗伯逊和李承晚的联合声明中，根本找不到“停战协定”这几个字，更不用说李承晚遵守停战协定的保证了。
    在全世界众目睽睽之下，罗伯逊觉得李承晚已答应了九十天内不阻挠停战，他可以交账了。但是，这简直是哄骗小孩子，简直是把停战当作儿戏。美方自己也知道，停战并不是九十天的休战，而是双方保证在朝鲜的敌对行为和一切武装行动的完全停止，以待朝鲜问题的和平解决的达成，这是已经双方协议的停战协定草案中序言所明确规定了的。李承晚只答应九十天内不阻挠停战，这说明他不仅不准备履行停战协定，而且准备破坏停战。美国政府同意了李承晚在九十天内不阻挠停战，这说明它不仅违反了停战协定的规定，而且同意了李承晚在九十天以后可以破坏停战。
    李承晚已宣称，九十天后，如果政治会议还没有作出令他满意的统一朝鲜的决定，他就单独行动了。这就是说，李承晚已蓄谋破坏政治会议，给政治会议限定了时间，使政治会议不是有关方面协商的场所，而是强使其他方面接受李承晚的野心计划。李承晚也明知朝中方面不会接受他的狂妄无理的要求，他的目的是要破坏政治会议，以便恢复战争。美国政府同意了李承晚这个意见，并答应届时将考虑应采取的任何行动，这就违反了停战协定的规定，因为协定并没有给政治会议以时间限制。现在，李承晚只允在九十天内不阻挠停战，那末九十天以后，当李承晚的政府和军队“单独行动”时，美方是否不加约束？如果美方不加约束，朝鲜怎能保持停战？如果要加约束，美方准备采取什么有效措施使李承晚政府和军队遵守停战协定？
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：世界的注意力集中到一个主要的问题上：美国政府准备提出何种程度的关于李承晚的政府和部队将执行停战条件的保证，如果停战协定签字的话，罗伯逊和李承晚的联合公报中没有任何肯定保证，说明李承晚政府将执行停战条件。这个事实更增加了这个问题的重要性。这个问题是必须在会议室里获得答复的。
    李承晚和罗伯逊的矛盾的声明表明：在他们的公报中还有些别的文章，并且说明了为什么哈利逊必须答复对实行停战协定具有决定性意义的一些问题。
    到目前为止，行动，甚至言词，都还不够。罗伯逊和李承晚的公报甚至还进一步破坏战俘协议，这个公报说：“在一定的时期结束时，凡是希望避免回到共产党统治下的俘虏都应在南朝鲜释放”。
    人们对于美国是否有诚意完全执行停战条款的怀疑，因李承晚发表的声明而更加加深了。在罗李联合声明发表之后，罗伯逊极力渲染，说什么他已经得到李承晚遵守停战条款的保证。但是李承晚的声明等于是在政治会议中放下了一枚定时炸弹。李承晚对美国记者说，他已和罗伯逊取得谅解，他将在九十天之后继续阻挠停战。他的外务部长官卞荣泰在十一日说：“我们在原则上不能接受对我们这样危险的一种停战”。罗伯逊和李承晚的“友好谅解”对于停战的前途是一个凶兆。
    所谓九十天之后继续阻挠停战，证明美国政府仍在继续纵容李承晚破坏停战协定，因为停战协定对停战是没有加以时间限制的。停战协定的序言规定：双方司令官“保证在朝鲜的敌对行为与一切武装行动完全停止的停战，以待最后和平解决的达成”。
    这一切迹象都说明了，李承晚对于停战仍是一个严重的威胁，因为美国对于严格遵守停战协定所有条款的态度是含糊的和模棱的。
