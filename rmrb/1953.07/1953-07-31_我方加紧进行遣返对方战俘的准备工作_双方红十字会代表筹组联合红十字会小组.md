Xinhua News Agency, Bitong, July 30th: Our side is stepping up preparations for the repatriation of United Nations forces prisoners of war. Peaceful Bitong has become lively. Our side has increased the number of personnel to prepare the supplies needed by the POWs on their journey. Trucks loaded with goods rumble through the streets.

    Many doctors and nurses in the hospital have received orders to be ready to depart with the sick and wounded POWs at any time, in order to take care of them along the way. Medical personnel are now busy making preparations.

    The POWs are also making preparations for their departure. They are asking the staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers for photos and other souvenirs, and asking the Chinese People's Volunteers to write inscriptions in their notebooks as a souvenir.

    The POW camp authorities are preparing a farewell meal for the POWs, and have specially slaughtered cattle and sheep for the Turkish soldiers who do not eat pork.

    The POWs continue to happily engage in various recreational and sports activities. They say, "Get in shape and go home." The playground is still very wet after the rain, and black POWs, Filipino and Puerto Rican POWs are already playing basketball. British POWs also performed a play last night.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 30th: Representatives of the Red Cross Society from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Red Cross Society of the People's Republic of China, along with representatives of the Red Cross Societies from the countries of the United Nations forces, held a meeting in Panmunjom on July 30th to begin organizing the Joint Red Cross teams stipulated in Article 57 of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    At the meeting, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies first expressed their hope that the representatives of both sides of the Joint Red Cross teams could successfully complete their tasks in a cooperative and collaborative spirit. The representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies also notified the other side's Red Cross representatives that the seventy representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies participating in the Joint Red Cross teams, with the exception of individual representatives, had all arrived in Kaesong and could depart at any time to perform their duties.

    The Red Cross representatives of both sides have also agreed in principle to form a Joint Red Cross team coordination group consisting of four representatives from each side, responsible for negotiating and resolving any problems that may arise in the Joint Red Cross teams.

    【新华社碧潼三十日电】我方正在加紧进行遣返联合国军战俘的准备工作。平静的碧潼变得热闹起来了。我方增加了大批人员为战俘们筹备旅途上需要的供应品。装满物品的汽车川流不息地从街上隆隆地驶过。
    医院里的许多医生和护士已经接到命令，准备随时和病伤战俘一起出发，以便沿路照料。现在医务人员正在忙碌地作着准备。
    战俘们也在作着离别的准备。他们向中国人民志愿军的工作人员要照片和其他纪念品，并要求中国人民志愿军在他们的本子上题字留念。
    战俘营当局正在准备给战俘饯行，并且特别为不吃猪肉的土耳其士兵宰了牛羊。
    战俘们继续快乐地进行着各种文娱体育活动。他们说：“炼好身体回家去。”雨后运动场还很湿，黑人战俘、菲律宾以及波多黎各的战俘们已经在比赛篮球了。英国的战俘在昨晚还演了一场话剧。
    【新华社开城三十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国红十字会与中华人民共和国红十字会的代表与联合国军各国的红十字会代表，七月三十日在板门店举行会议，开始筹组朝鲜停战协定第五十七款所规定的联合红十字会小组。
