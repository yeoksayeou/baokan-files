Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th:

Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, issued a ceasefire order to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The full text of the order is as follows:

To all comrades of the Korean People's Army:
To all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

After three years of heroic war resisting aggression and defending peace, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have persisted in two years of armistice negotiations to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Now, we have achieved the glorious victory of the Korean armistice and signed the Korean Armistice Agreement with the United Nations Forces.

The signing of the Armistice Agreement is the first step in resolving the Korean issue peacefully, and is therefore beneficial to peace in the Far East and the world. It has been warmly supported by the people of Korea and China, and has greatly inspired peace-loving people all over the world. However, some warmongers on the United Nations Forces side, especially the Syngman Rhee group, are deeply dissatisfied with the realization of the Korean armistice and are therefore strongly opposed to the signing of the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, all comrades of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers must be highly vigilant.

As the Armistice Agreement comes into effect, in order to resolutely guarantee the realization of the Korean armistice and prevent its sabotage, and to facilitate the convening of a political conference for the further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, we issue the following orders:

One, All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' army, air force, navy, and coastal defense forces shall resolutely abide by the Armistice Agreement. Starting from 22:00 on July 27, 1953, that is, twelve hours after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, a complete ceasefire shall be implemented along the entire front. Within seventy-two hours starting from 22:00 on July 27, 1953, that is, seventy-two hours after the Armistice Agreement comes into effect, all forces along the entire front shall withdraw two kilometers behind the already announced military demarcation line and shall not enter the demilitarized zone again.

Two, All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' army, air force, navy, and coastal defense forces shall maintain high alert, hold their positions, and prevent any invasion or sabotage from the other side.

Three, All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers shall welcome the personnel of the Military Armistice Commission and its joint observation teams, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its affiliated personnel, and the Joint Red Cross teams who enter the areas under our control to implement the Armistice Agreement, and shall be responsible for protecting their safety and actively assisting them in their work.

Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
Marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim Il-sung

Peng Dehuai

    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军发布停战命令
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军发布停战命令。命令全文如下：朝鲜人民军全体同志们：中国人民志愿军全体同志们：
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，经过了三年抵抗侵略、保卫和平的英勇战争，坚持了两年争取和平解决朝鲜问题的停战谈判，现在已经获得了朝鲜停战的光荣胜利，与联合国军签订了朝鲜停战协定。
    停战协定的签订是以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的第一步，因而是有利于远东及世界和平的。它获得了朝中两国人民的热烈拥护，使全世界爱好和平人民受到了莫大的鼓舞。但是，在联合国军方面尚有一部分好战分子尤其是李承晚集团对朝鲜停战的实现深感不满，因而对停战协定的签订极表反对。为此，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体同志必须提高警惕。
    在停战协定开始生效之际，为了坚决保证朝鲜停战的实现和不遭破坏，并有利于政治会议的召开以便进一步和平解决朝鲜问题起见，我们发布命令如下：
    一、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的陆军、空军、海军、海防部队全体人员应坚决遵守停战协定，自一九五三年七月二十七日二十二时起，即停战协定签字后的十二小时起，全线完全停火；在一九五三年七月二十七日二十二时起的七十二小时内，即停战协定生效后的七十二小时内，全线一律自双方已经公布的军事分界线后撤二公里，并一律不得再进入非军事区一步。
    二、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的陆军、空军、海军、海防部队全体人员应保持高度戒备，坚守阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和破坏行动。
    三、凡为执行停战协定而进入我军控制地区的军事停战委员会及其联合观察小组所属人员、中立国委员会及其所属人员、以及联合红十字会小组所属人员，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体人员均应对之表示欢迎，负责保护其安全并在其工作上予以积极协助。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国元帅  金日成
    中国人民志愿军司令员  彭德怀
    一九五三年七月二十七日
