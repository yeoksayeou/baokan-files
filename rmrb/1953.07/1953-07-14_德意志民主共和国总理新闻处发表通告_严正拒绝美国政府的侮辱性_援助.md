Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th (TASS dispatch): The German News Agency reports: The Press Office of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic issued a communiqué regarding the United States government's note to the Soviet government on July 10th, suggesting supplying the residents of the German Democratic Republic with 15 million US dollars worth of food.

The communiqué said: Those forces who fear that the government of the German Democratic Republic will implement policies to improve the material conditions of the residents of the German Democratic Republic, and to restore the unification of our homeland in a peaceful manner, and who have plotted to sabotage these policies by means of the fascist adventurism of June 17th, after suffering a shameful and disastrous defeat, are now attempting to organize their espionage activities through "US aid"... The government of the German Democratic Republic announced several years ago that it was willing to sign an internal German trade agreement of 2 billion marks per year. The relevant American authorities and the Adenauer government have done everything possible to obstruct this effort, resulting in huge losses not only to the economy of eastern Germany, but also to the economy of western Germany. West German companies have been persecuted and punished by the Bonn government for engaging in trade relations with the German Democratic Republic, and the Americans have confiscated US dollars from the accounts of the German Democratic Republic; despite our repeated protests, they have not been returned to this day.

The communiqué pointed out that the American suggestion can only be regarded as a propaganda-motivated provocation, and said: If the US government is truly willing to help the German people, then it should first abolish all restrictions on internal German trade, support the freedom of domestic and foreign trade in Germany, and abolish the Schuman Plan.

If the US government abolishes the Paris and Bonn military treaties and agrees to convene a Four-Power conference to peacefully resolve the German issue, that would be the best help for Germany.

The communiqué emphasized: The residents of the German Democratic Republic consider the US government's suggestion an insult, and therefore reject this "US aid." If the United States and Adenauer abandon their hostile attitude towards the German Democratic Republic and return the US dollars on the German Democratic Republic's accounts, normal and mutually equal trade agreements can be concluded.

The communiqué exposed that American newspapers deliberately created the impression that the German Democratic Republic could not survive without American supplies. The communiqué emphasized: It is quite obvious that this is wishful thinking. The German Democratic Republic belongs to the countries of the democratic world market, and its government has already concluded favorable trade agreements with the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and is currently conducting negotiations on supplementary agreements regarding the Soviet Union's supply of goods to the German Democratic Republic.

    德意志民主共和国总理新闻处发表通告
    严正拒绝美国政府的侮辱性“援助”
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处就美国政府七月十日照会苏联政府、建议供给德意志民主共和国居民一千五百万美元的食物一事发表通告。
    通告说：那些害怕德意志民主共和国政府实行改善德意志民主共和国居民的物质状况，以和平方式恢复我们祖国统一的方针，并曾阴谋借助于六月十七日的法西斯冒险行动来破坏这一方针的势力，在遭到可耻的惨败之后，又企图通过“美援”组织自己的间谍活动……。德意志民主共和国政府早在几年前就宣布它愿意签订每年二十亿马克的德国内部贸易协定。有关的美国机关和阿登纳政府千方百计地阻挠这种努力，结果不但使德国东部的经济遭受了巨大的损失，也使德国西部的经济遭受了巨大的损失。西德的公司，由于与德意志民主共和国发生贸易关系，遭受到波恩政府的迫害和惩罚，美国人没收了德意志民主共和国账户上的美元；尽管我们几次提出抗议，直到今日还没有归还。
    通告指出，美国的建议只能被认为是以宣传为目的的挑衅，并说：假使美国政府真正愿意援助德国人民，那它就应当首先废除对于德国内部贸易的一切限制，赞同德国国内、对外贸易的自由，并取消舒曼计划。
    如果美国政府废除巴黎与波恩军事条约，赞成召开四国会议以和平解决德国问题，那就是对德国最好的帮助。
    通告强调说：德意志民主共和国的居民认为美国政府的建议是一种侮辱，因此拒绝这种“美援”。要是美国和阿登纳放弃对德意志民主共和国的敌视态度，发还德意志民主共和国账户上的美元，就可以缔结正常的互相平等的贸易协定。
    通告揭露美国报纸故意造成一种印象，仿佛德意志民主共和国离不了美国的供应。通告着重说：十分显然，这是痴人说梦。德意志民主共和国属于民主世界市场的国家之列，它的政府和苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚以及罗马尼亚已经缔结了有利的贸易协定，而且目前正进行关于苏联供应德意志民主共和国货物的补充协定的谈判。
