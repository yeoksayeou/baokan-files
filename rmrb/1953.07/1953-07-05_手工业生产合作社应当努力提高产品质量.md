    Handicraft Production Cooperatives Should Strive to Improve Product Quality

    Over the past three years, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, 2,600 handicraft production cooperatives have been established nationwide, with 260,000 members. They have played a certain role in meeting the production and living needs of the broad masses of urban and rural people. However, currently, many grassroots handicraft production cooperatives are experiencing serious product backlogs due to the low quality of their products, which fail to meet the needs of the people. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Ironware Production Cooperative has a backlog of 1,700 tons of wrought iron and iron goods; the Ganlin Town Ironware Production Cooperative in Sheng County, Zhejiang, has a backlog of agricultural tools worth 25 million yuan; the Beijing Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative has a backlog of cloth worth 1.5 billion yuan. Some grassroots cooperatives have been unable to sustain production due to product backlogs and sluggish capital turnover. These facts show that failure to improve product quality will seriously affect the development of handicraft production cooperatives.

    What are the reasons for the low quality of products from these handicraft production cooperatives?

    Some leading cadres in the cooperative system have adopted hasty and impetuous methods to organize and develop handicraft production cooperatives. They disregard the actual situation of backward handicraft production technology, decentralized production, and simple equipment, and prematurely demand that handicraft production cooperatives become mechanized and collectivized, mistakenly using methods for running state-owned factories to run handicraft production cooperatives. In the fourth quarter of last year, Beijing forcibly merged the Second, Fourth, and Eighth Cotton Weaving Production Cooperatives into one cotton weaving production cooperative, changing from manual production to electric motor production. Because workers could not master the technology immediately, and because the piece-rate wage system was adopted, workers simply pursued quantity, neglecting quality. As a result, the defective cloth rate rose from 21% to 70% (the defective cloth rate has now decreased). The development of handicraft production cooperatives must adopt a policy of steady progress. After handicraftsmen are organized through cooperatives, the concentrated use of funds and production management provides the possibility for handicraft production cooperatives to move towards modernization and mechanization. However, to achieve this goal, it is necessary to create the necessary conditions in terms of technology and ideology. Handicraft production cooperatives organized using blindly impetuous methods cannot be consolidated, and this is a lesson worth learning.

    Secondly, the work of integrating production and sales is not done well enough. On the one hand, cadres of handicraft production cooperatives have the idea of "emphasizing production and neglecting sales," failing to investigate and study the needs of the people, working behind closed doors, and even producing shoddy goods. On the other hand, some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives have the idea of "attending to sales and neglecting production," blindly guaranteeing the sale of products from handicraft production cooperatives without strictly implementing product inspections, urging them to improve production technology, and improve product quality. It is right for supply and marketing cooperatives to attach importance to promoting the products of handicraft production cooperatives. However, it is wrong to blindly guarantee sales without conducting investigations and research, without analyzing production and sales, and without supervising handicraft production cooperatives to improve product quality. Supply and marketing cooperatives should not only serve consumers, but also serve production. They should actively find sales channels for the products of handicraft production cooperatives, and at the same time inspect and supervise the products of handicraft production cooperatives, frequently reflecting consumers' opinions on product specifications and quality, and helping handicraft production cooperatives improve production. It can be seen that strengthening the integration of production and sales is an effective way to improve the product quality and expand the sales of handicraft production cooperatives.

    The main reason is that some handicraft production cooperatives have capitalist management ideas. Some grassroots cooperatives have one-sided profit-seeking views, cutting corners, producing shoddy goods, or arbitrarily breaking contracts and failing to keep their promises. This greatly affects the reputation and sales of handicraft production cooperative products. Obviously, this capitalist management idea that is irresponsible to consumers cannot be tolerated. Some grassroots cadres not only do not recognize the seriousness of this wrong thinking, but also think that this is a "historical habit" and that it does not matter, which is even more wrong. The so-called "historical habit" was formed when handicraft producers operated in a scattered manner before liberation. At that time, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the existence of anarchic production led to the seasonality of handicraft production. In peak seasons, even if the product quality was poor, it could be sold well, and in off-seasons, even if the goods were good, no one would want them. Therefore, the so-called "historical habit" of handicraft producers not paying attention to product quality and producing shoddy goods was formed. Today, many handicraft production cooperatives carry out planned production through processing orders from state-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. As long as the products are cheap, beautiful, and meet the needs of the people, there is no need to worry about sales, and the seasonality in production can be gradually overcome. Therefore, the "historical habit" before liberation should have been changed long ago. Handicraft production cooperatives are by no means purely for profit, but more importantly, they should develop production to serve the needs of national economic construction and people's lives. If capitalist management methods are adopted, not only will the role of serving production not be brought into play, but the handicraft production cooperatives themselves cannot be consolidated and improved. Therefore, this capitalist management thinking must be severely criticized.

    In order to overcome this erroneous thinking and correct the management policy of handicraft production cooperatives, local Party and government organs and higher-level cooperatives should strengthen the political and ideological leadership of grassroots cooperatives, gradually change the habits of small producers such as laxity, selfishness, and lack of foresight, educate members to establish new labor attitudes, and improve members' class consciousness to ensure continuous improvement of product quality.

    Handicraft production cooperatives must establish and improve production management systems. At present, the first thing to do is to gradually unify the specifications and standards of product quality, and strictly implement the product inspection system. Before manufacturing new products, handicraft production cooperatives can send samples to higher-level cooperatives and ordering units for negotiation to determine the grade standards of product quality. In the production process, strictly implement product quality supervision and inspection. A production responsibility system should be gradually established to enhance members' sense of responsibility for improving product quality. In addition, a regular technical exchange meeting system should also be established in grassroots cooperatives to gradually improve production technology and ensure product quality. The establishment of these systems must be based on existing equipment, technical level, and other conditions, and should not be too ambitious. The process of improving product quality is a process of continuous improvement of members' thinking. Consolidating the results of ideological education with systems can more effectively achieve the goal of improving product quality.

### 手工业生产合作社应当努力提高产品质量

    手工业生产合作社应当努力提高产品质量
    三年来，在人民政府的领导与扶植下，全国各地已经成立了两千六百个手工业生产合作社，拥有社员二十六万人，在满足城乡广大人民生产和生活的需要上，是有一定作用的。但目前有许多手工业生产合作社的基层社由于产品质量低劣，不合广大人民需要，造成产品严重积压的现象。例如，山西全省铁业生产合作社积压熟铁及铁货达一千七百吨；浙江嵊县甘霖镇铁业生产合作社积压了价值二千五百万元的农具；北京市棉织生产合作社积压的布匹价值达十五亿元。有些基层社已因产品积压、资金周转迟滞，无法维持生产。这些事实说明：产品质量如不提高，将严重影响到手工业生产合作社的发展。
    什么原因造成这些手工业生产合作社的产品质量这样低劣呢？
    有些合作社系统的领导干部采取急躁冒进的方法组织与发展手工业生产合作社。他们无视手工业生产技术落后，生产分散，设备简陋的实际情况，过早地要求手工业生产合作社机械化、集体化，错误地用办国营工厂的办法来办手工业生产合作社。北京市于去年第四季度，将第二、四、八棉织生产合作社硬性地合并为一个棉织生产合作社，由原来的手工业生产改为电机生产。由于工人一时掌握不了技术，加以采用计件工资制后，工人单纯追求数量，忽视质量，结果次布率由百分之二十一度上升到百分之七十（次布率现已下降）。手工业生产合作社的发展，必须采取稳步前进的方针。手工业者通过合作社方式组织起来以后，由于资金使用、生产管理较前集中，这仅给手工业生产合作社走向现代化、机械化提供了可能性，但要达到这个目的，还须创造技术、思想等方面的必要的条件。用盲目冒进的方法组织起来的手工业生产合作社绝不能巩固，这是值得引为教训的。
    其次，产销结合的工作做得不够。一方面是手工业生产合作社的干部存在“重产不重销”的思想，不调查研究人民的需要，闭门造车，甚至粗制滥造。另一方面是某些供销合作社的干部存在“顾销不顾产”思想，盲目包销手工业生产合作社的产品，但不严格实行产品检查，督促它改进生产技术，提高产品质量。供销合作社重视推销手工业生产合作社的产品，这是对的。但不进行调查研究，不分析产销情况，盲目包销，不监督手工业生产合作社提高产品质量，这就错了。供销合作社不仅要为消费者服务，而且还要为生产服务。它应该积极为手工业生产合作社的产品找销路，同时对手工业生产合作社的产品进行检查和监督，经常反映消费者对产品规格质量的意见，帮助手工业生产合作社改进生产。由此可见，加强产销的结合，是提高手工业生产合作社产品质量和扩大销路的有效方法。
    更主要的原因，是某些手工业生产合作社存在着资本主义的经营思想。有些基层社存在片面营利观点，偷工减料，粗制滥造，或任意破坏合同，不守信用。这就大大影响了手工业生产合作社产品的信誉和销路。非常显然，这种对消费者不负责任的资本主义经营思想是不能令人容忍的。有些基层社干部不但没有认识这种错误思想的严重性，反而以为这是“历史习惯”，没有什么关系，这就更加错误了。所谓“历史习惯”，乃是解放前手工业生产者分散经营的时候养成的。那时在国民党反动派的统治下，由于生产的无政府状态的存在，造成了手工业生产的季节性。旺季时产品质量虽差也能旺销，淡季时货物再好也没人要。因此造成手工业生产者不重视产品质量、粗制滥造的所谓“历史习惯”。今天许多手工业生产合作社通过国营贸易公司和供销合作社的加工订货，进行有计划的生产，只要产品价廉物美又合乎人民需要，就不愁没有销路，生产上的季节性可以逐步克服。因此，解放前那种“历史习惯”早已应该改变了。手工业生产合作社绝不是单纯营利，更重要的是发展生产为国家经济建设和人民生活需要服务。如果采取资本主义的经营方法，不但不能发挥为生产服务的作用，即手工业生产合作社自身也不能巩固和提高。因此，这种资本主义经营思想必须受到严正的批判。
    为克服这种错误思想，端正手工业生产合作社的经营方针，地方党、政机关和上级合作社应当加强对基层社的政治思想领导，逐渐改变小生产者的那种散漫、自私和缺乏远见等习气，教育社员树立新的劳动态度，提高社员的阶级觉悟，以保证产品质量的不断提高。
    手工业生产合作社必须建立与健全生产管理制度。目前首先要逐步统一产品质量的规格标准，严格执行产品检查制度。手工业生产合作社在制造新产品之前，可将样品送交上级社与订货单位洽商，定出产品质量的等级标准，在生产过程中，严格实行产品质量的监督与检查。要逐步建立生产责任制度，提高社员对改进产品质量的责任心。此外，还应在基层社建立定期技术交流会制度，以便逐步改进生产技术，保证产品质量。这些制度的建立，必须根据现有设备、技术水平等条件，不可好高骛远。产品质量提高的过程，就是社员思想不断提高的过程，用制度把思想教育的成果巩固起来，便可以更有效地达到提高产品质量的目的。
