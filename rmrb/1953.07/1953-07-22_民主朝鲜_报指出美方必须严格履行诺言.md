(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 21st) The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 20th entitled "The U.S. Must Strictly Abide by and Fulfill its Promises." The editorial pointed out that the current progress in the armistice negotiations is the result of our efforts. The editorial emphasized: The Syngman Rhee gang is still openly clamoring that it has the freedom to take action against the armistice. Although the U.S. has made some guarantees, it has not completely eliminated the danger of the Syngman Rhee gang undermining the armistice. Therefore, the key to the problem lies in whether the U.S. strictly fulfills the serious guarantees it has made to achieve the armistice. If the U.S. continues to adopt an irresponsible attitude and a policy of acquiescence, then the implementation of the armistice agreement, both before and after the armistice, may continue to be undermined. The editorial concluded: The armistice negotiations have progressed to the point of carrying out various preparations before the signing of the agreement due to the agreement of both parties, but the realization of the armistice and whether the various clauses can be implemented after the signing depend entirely on whether the U.S. strictly abides by and fulfills the various guarantees it has made.

    “民主朝鲜”报指出美方必须严格履行诺言
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】“民主朝鲜”报二十日以“美方必须严格遵守和履行自己的诺言”为题发表社论。社论指出，停战谈判所以有目前的进展，是由于我方努力的结果。社论强调指出：李承晚匪帮仍然在公开地叫嚣它有为反对停战而采取行动的自由。美方虽已作了一些保证，但还没有完全消除李承晚匪帮破坏停战的危险性。因此，问题的关键在于美方是否严格履行自己所作的为实现停战的严肃保证。如果美方继续采取不负责的态度和默许的政策，那末，不论在停战前后，停战协定条款的实施仍有继续遭到破坏的可能。社论最后说：停战谈判已经由于双方的同意而进展到进行协定签字前的各项准备工作的地步，但是，停战的实现和在签字以后各项条款能否被实施，完全系于美方是否严格遵守和履行它所作的各项保证。
