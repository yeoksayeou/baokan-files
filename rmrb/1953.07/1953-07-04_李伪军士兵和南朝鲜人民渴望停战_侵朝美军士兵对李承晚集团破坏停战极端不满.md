Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 3rd: The Syngman Rhee gang's actions to sabotage the armistice negotiations have been fiercely opposed by the Li pseudo-army soldiers and the vast South Korean people who yearn for an armistice. According to recently captured Li pseudo-army soldiers, when an agreement was reached on the issue of prisoner repatriation, the Li pseudo-army soldiers on the front lines jumped for joy. Soldiers who were repairing cannons immediately stopped working, and vehicles transporting ammunition also stopped on the road. Many soldiers were so happy that they even threw their helmets down the mountain. New recruits who were feigning illness due to war-weariness crawled out of their dark bunkers saying: The terrible war is about to stop.

However, when the news came that the Syngman Rhee gang opposed the armistice and frantically clamored to "fight alone," the mood of the Li pseudo-army soldiers, who longed for an armistice and to return home, immediately became depressed. Many people started feigning illness again. Some soldiers of the 28th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Li pseudo-army said angrily when they were sent to patrol the front lines: We don't want to die anymore. Some soldiers even broke their rifles in two, and then pulled out their bayonets and stabbed themselves in the thighs.

In mid-June, the Syngman Rhee gang's police forced the residents of Seoul to participate in "anti-armistice demonstrations," but many residents were unwilling to shout slogans "opposing the armistice." According to captured Li pseudo-army soldiers, during the demonstrations, the Syngman Rhee gang's police took the opportunity to tie up some physically fit men with ropes and send them to the Li pseudo-army to serve as cannon fodder. A Li pseudo-army soldier who was recently captured was taken away at that time. He was already thirty-eight years old, and his two younger brothers had been taken away by the Syngman Rhee gang as early as last year and had already lost their lives in the war. This Li pseudo-army soldier was captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the battlefield before he had even learned how to use a weapon. He said: "The suffering South Korean people no longer want to fight. Everyone hopes that peace will come soon."

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: American soldiers eager to realize an armistice in Korea are extremely dissatisfied with the increasingly rampant sabotage of the armistice by the Syngman Rhee group.

According to a United Press report from New York on the 2nd, a group of American soldiers who had recently returned home from Korea cursed Syngman Rhee as they disembarked. Corporal DeMait said, "I want to shoot Syngman Rhee." Corporal Kleinitz said, "I saw Syngman Rhee one day, and I deeply regret that I didn't give him a shot that day. All the soldiers on the ship hated him, and many people really didn't understand what they were doing in Korea." Sergeant Louis said, "Syngman Rhee destroyed the morale of every American soldier in Korea."

American soldiers on the front lines, eager to return home, are even more annoyed by Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice, and their morale is very low. According to a United Press reporter, when he spoke with American soldiers on the western front of Korea, Lieutenant John Wilcott said that when the prisoner agreement was signed in Panmunjom, the soldiers under his command "were indeed extremely excited." "After that, these soldiers simply didn't come out of the bunkers. They really just stayed in them." Later, after the incident of Syngman Rhee "releasing" prisoners of war, "the morale plummeted." Many soldiers cursed Syngman Rhee, saying: "Only one guy is causing trouble." The United Press report also said, "Several people said that Korean laborers and other Koreans belonging to the U.S. military units had voluntarily offered to go to Seoul to kill Syngman Rhee."

    李伪军士兵和南朝鲜人民渴望停战
    侵朝美军士兵对李承晚集团破坏停战极端不满
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】李承晚匪帮破坏停战谈判的行动，受到渴望停战的李伪军士兵和广大的南朝鲜人民激烈的反对。据新近被我军俘获的李伪军士兵说，当战俘遣返问题达成协议时，在阵地上的李伪军士兵欢乐得跳了起来，正在修理大炮的士兵马上停止了工作，运输弹药的汽车也在公路上停了下来，很多士兵甚至高兴得把钢盔丢到山下去。因厌战而装病的新兵们也钻出阴暗的地堡说：可怕的战争就要停止了。
    但当李承晚匪帮反对停战，疯狂叫嚣要“单独打下去”的消息传出以后，渴望停战回家的李伪军士兵们的情绪顿时消沉下来，有许多人就又装起病来。李伪军第九师二十八团有些士兵被派到前沿阵地去巡逻时都气愤地说：我们再也不愿送死了。有的士兵甚至将步枪砸成两段，然后拔出刺刀将自己的大腿刺伤。
    六月中旬，李承晚匪帮的警察强迫汉城居民参加“反停战游行”，但很多居民都不愿意喊“反对停战”的口号。据被俘的李伪军士兵说，在游行时，李承晚匪帮的警察就乘机将一些身体比较好的男子用绳子绑起来，送到李伪军中去充当炮灰。新近被俘的一个李伪军士兵就是在那时被抓走的。他已经三十八岁了，他的两个弟弟早在去年就被李承晚匪帮抓走，并且已经在战争中送掉了性命。这个李伪军士兵还没有学会使用武器就在战场上被中国人民志愿军俘掳了。他说：“苦难的南朝鲜人民是再也不愿打下去了，人人都希望和平早些到来”。
    【新华社三日讯】渴望实现朝鲜停战的美军士兵，对李承晚集团越来越猖狂的破坏停战行为极端不满。
    据合众社纽约二日电报道，最近轮换回国的一批侵朝美军士兵在下船登陆时，都痛骂李承晚。下士第麦说，“我要枪毙李承晚。”下士克莱尼兹说，“我曾经有一天看到过李承晚，我现在深悔那天没有请他吃一枪。船上所有士兵都讨厌他，许多人真不懂他们在朝鲜干吗。”中士路易说，“李承晚摧毁了在朝鲜的每个美国士兵的士气。”
    在战线上的归心如箭的美军士兵对李承晚破坏停战更加恼怒，士气十分低落。据合众社记者报道，他与朝鲜西线的美军士兵谈话时，中尉约翰·威尔柯脱说，当板门店签订战俘协议时，他手下的士兵“的确兴奋极了”。“在这以后，这些士兵简直就不出地堡。他们真的就死呆在里面”。后来，李承晚“释放”战俘的事件发生后，“这下子士气就一落千丈”。许多士兵痛骂李承晚说：“只有一个家伙在捣鬼。”合众社的报道还说，“有几个人说，朝鲜劳工和别的隶属于美军部队的朝鲜人，曾经自动表示要到汉城去杀死李承晚。”
