Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 23rd: TASS reported from Berlin on July 22nd: The German News Agency reported that the West German middle class, craftsman, small industrialist and businessman representatives' conference, presided over by the German Communist Party, was held on July 19th in Neu-Isenburg near Frankfurt. The meeting heard the German Communist Party's twelve-point plan to help the West German middle class.

The plan pointed out that the actions of the Bonn government over the past four years have been extremely unfortunate for the West German middle class. From 1950 to the end of 1952, the number of handicraft businesses in West Germany decreased by 59,494, equivalent to 7 percent of the total. Raw material prices continued to rise, and taxes and various compulsory burdens became heavier and heavier. Due to the reduction in people's purchasing power, the turnover of handicrafts and small businesses decreased. Due to the increasing power of West German monopoly capital, the number of West German small businesses going bankrupt is increasing.

The plan emphasized that the current Bonn government and the Bonn coalition parties, which obediently follow American orders, are responsible for the tragic situation of the West German middle class.

The Cold War has placed a heavy burden on the middle class, and they can no longer afford the restrictions, taxes, and compulsory burdens imposed on them by the re-militarization policy and huge occupation costs. The Bonn and Paris war treaties have further bankrupted the middle class.

The German Communist Party advocates changing the balance of political forces in the Federal Parliament in future elections, defeating the anti-national Adenauer government, and replacing it with a coalition government composed of German patriots. The immediate task of this government should be to reach an agreement between East and West Germany, and to utilize and develop all opportunities that can promote German reunification and conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

In its plan to aid the middle class, the German Communist Party put forward some specific proposals, demanding that the immediate demands of the West German middle class be met.

The German News Agency said that the West German middle class representatives' conference passed the German Communist Party's plan because this plan helps West German craftsmen and small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to escape their tragic situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 21st: TASS reported from Dusseldorf that the West German Committee of Peace Fighters held its tenth plenary meeting on July 18th and 19th, and passed a letter to the people of East and West Germany.

The letter to the people of East and West Germany said: The World Peace Council, at its Budapest meeting in June 1953, called for a campaign for peace negotiations to be launched worldwide. The Budapest Declaration of the World Peace Council instructed German peace fighters to call on all German people to demand that the governments of the two parts of Germany, and the four occupying authorities of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States, immediately begin unconditional peaceful settlement negotiations on the German question. The East and West have expressed their willingness to negotiate, and now the East German government has declared its agreement to start negotiations without prior conditions. Only negotiations can open the path to peaceful reunification and peace for Germany.

The letter to the people of East and West Germany called on citizens in West Germany to demand that all candidates for the Federal Parliament advocate immediate and unconditional negotiations in the upcoming elections.

    德共的主张获得西德各阶层拥护
    西德中产阶级代表会议通过德共帮助计划
    争取和平战士委员会号召促成东西德谈判
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：德意志通讯社报道说，德国共产党主持的西德中产阶级、手工业者、中小工商业者代表会议，于七月十九日在法兰克福附近的新伊森堡举行。会议听取了德国共产党帮助西德中产阶级的十二点计划。
    计划指出，波恩政府四年来所作所为的结果，对西德中产阶级是极为不幸的。从一九五○年到一九五二年年底，西德的手工业减少了五万九千四百九十四家，等于总数的百分之七。原料价格继续上涨，赋税和各种各样强迫负担越来越重。由于人民的购买力降低，手工业和小工商业的营业额减少了。由于西德垄断资本的日益强大，西德小企业倒闭的数目越来越多。
    计划着重指出，目前的波恩政府与千依百顺地服从美国命令的波恩各联合党派要为西德中产阶级的悲惨境况负责。
    冷战使中产阶级的负担很重，他们再也负担不起重新军国主义化政策和庞大的占领费用加于他们的限制、赋税和强迫负担了。波恩和巴黎战争条约使得中产阶级进一步地破产。
    德国共产党主张在未来的选举中改变联邦议院中的政治力量对比，击败反民族的阿登纳政府，而代之以一个德国爱国人士组成的联合政府。这个政府的当务之急应该是达成东西德之间的协议，利用并发展能促使德国重归统一，并缔结对德和约的一切机会。
    德国共产党在它的援助中产阶级计划中，提出了一些具体主张，要求满足西德中产阶级的切身要求。
    德意志通讯社说，西德中产阶级代表会议通过了德国共产党的计划，因为这个计划有助于西德手工业者与中小工商业者摆脱他们的悲惨处境。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：德意志通讯社自杜塞尔多夫报道，西德争取和平战士委员会在七月十八、十九两日举行了第十届全体会议，通过告东西德人民书。
    告东西德人民书说：世界和平理事会在一九五三年六月举行的布达佩斯会议上，号召在全世界范围内展开争取和平谈判的运动。世界和平理事会的布达佩斯宣言责成德国的和平战士号召全体德国人民要求德国东西两部分的政府，要求英国、法国、苏联和美国四国占领当局立即开始无条件地和平解决德国问题的谈判。东西两部已经表示愿意谈判，现在东德政府又声明同意在不事先提出任何条件的情况下开始谈判。只有谈判才能替德国打开和平统一与和平的道路。
    告东西德人民书号召，在即将到来的选举中，西德的公民们应当要求所有的联邦议院候选人主张立刻和无条件地举行谈判。
