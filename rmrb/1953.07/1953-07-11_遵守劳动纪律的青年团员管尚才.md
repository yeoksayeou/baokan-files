    Guan Shangcai, a Youth League Member Who Abides by Labor Discipline
    Youth League Committee of Jingxi Mining Bureau
    Guan Shangcai, a Youth League member and driller at Fangshan 1103 Active Site, has been consistently active in his work and has abided by labor discipline without a single absence since he started working at the Fangshan Mine a year and a half ago.

    Before June of last year, he was still a temporary worker. At that time, he was responsible for militia work in the village, having to return to the village for drill once a week (the village is five *li* from the mine) and having to take a turn at sentry duty every five days (after work). However, even under these circumstances, he still ensured he worked twenty-five days a month.

    Last June, he became a permanent worker and moved to the mine (his militia duties in the village have been lifted as per the regulations). He said: "Living at the mine allows me to attend meetings, classes, and listen to reports on time, learn more knowledge, and do more work." As a result, he worked even more actively. Last November, when it was his turn to go home for a break, there was a strong wind and heavy snow when he returned to the mine at the end of his leave. The road was very difficult to travel, but he still braved the wind and snow and groped his way back to the mine to start work. When the Youth League Branch Secretary asked him why he rushed back under these circumstances, he said: "It was really difficult to walk back, but I thought to myself that I am a Youth League member and cannot bow my head to these difficulties. If I am absent, it will bring a bad influence to the organization and cause losses to the country. What do these difficulties amount to when compared to the difficulties encountered by the volunteers fighting on the front lines?"

    He has never taken sick leave. In March of this year, there was a miscommunication during shift handover one day, and the blasting time for the 1601 Active Site was not clearly established. Guan Shangcai was operating when the blast went off, and he was knocked down and injured his leg. However, the next day, he insisted on going to work with a limp, unwilling to take a break. Not only does he not absent himself, but he also actively persuades others not to be absent. Shen Keling, a worker in his team, often took time off, so he patiently advised him, "If you don't come to work, our task will be affected, and it won't be good for you personally." Later, Shen Keling improved. When the team's attendance was insufficient, he took the initiative to stand in for others. He said, "I stand in not just for him personally, but to complete the plan and prevent production from being affected."

    Comrade Guan Shangcai not only has good attendance, but he has also never violated operating procedures or had any accidents. He attends all meetings and study sessions on time and participates in discussions and learning conscientiously.

    Because of his good production, diligent study, and rapid progress, he was promoted from a fourth-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker in March of this year.

    遵守劳动纪律的青年团员管尚才
    青年团京西矿务局委员会
    房山一一○三活地钻工、青年团员管尚才，到房山矿做工一年半以来，工作一贯积极，遵守劳动纪律，没旷过一次工。
    去年六月以前，他还是临时工。当时他担任着村里的民兵工作，每礼拜要回村练一次操（村子离矿五里地），每五天要轮班放一次哨（下班以后去），但在这种情况下他也保证了每月上二十五天班。
    去年六月他转为长期工人，就搬到矿上来住了（他在村里的民兵职务已按规定解除）。他说：“搬到矿上住可以按时参加会议、上课、听报告，多长些知识，工作也能多作些。”这样一来，他工作得更积极了。去年十一月间他轮休回家，期满回矿的时候，又刮大风，又下大雪，路很难走，但是他还是冒着风雪，摸着黑路，赶回矿上来上班。团支部书记问他为什么在这种情况下还赶回来，他说：“走回来真是困难，不过我想起自己是个青年团员，不能为这点困难就低头，我要是旷工，会给组织带来不好的影响，给国家带来损失。这一点困难和志愿军在前线打仗碰到的困难比起来，那又算得了什么？”
    他一直没有请过病假。今年三月里，有一天交接班没有联系好，没有搞清一六○一活地的响炮时间。管尚才正在操作时炮响了，他被震倒，碰伤了腿部，可是第二天他又一拐一拐地坚持着上了班，不愿歇工。他不但自己不旷工，还主动说服别人不要旷工。他同班的工人申克伶常歇班，他便耐心地劝他说：“你要不上班，咱们任务就要受影响，对你个人也没有好处。”后来申克伶变好了。小组出勤不够时，他就主动替别人出勤，他说：“我替班不只是替他个人，而是为了完成计划，使生产不受影响。”
    管尚才同志不但出勤好，也没有违反过操作规程，没有出过事故。所有的会议和学习他都准时参加，认真讨论和学习。
    由于他生产好，学习努力，进步快，今年三月，他由四级工升为五级工。
