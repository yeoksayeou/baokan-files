Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 12th: The "Message News" diplomatic observer, Mai. Mikhailov, wrote an article commenting on the US-UK-France Foreign Ministers' Meeting which began on the 10th in Washington.

The article said: This meeting was held after the indefinite postponement of the Bermuda meeting of the leaders of the governments of these three countries. The current difficulties in the relationship between the United States and its British and French partners overshadow this meeting. These difficulties have not been alleviated by changing the meeting place and participants. Correctly speaking, these difficulties, caused by the deepening divisions between Washington, London, and Paris, have made the US ruling clique feel that the failure of the Bermuda meeting was a welcome event. The United States recognized that the differences in methods for resolving various international issues are very serious, especially the differences between the US and the UK. Even a regular meeting between heads of government could not eliminate these differences, so it lost interest in the Bermuda meeting.

Washington politicians have had to note whether they can achieve the goals they set for the Bermuda meeting—to organize an anti-Soviet conspiracy of the Western three countries to maintain and exacerbate international tensions—is still a question. The United States wanted to weaken the Western European movement calling for the resolution of international issues in consultation with the Soviet Union, but it did not succeed. Washington had to admit that its attempts to set preconditions for holding a great power conference had been deemed impractical by the broad public and clear-headed politicians.

The failure of the Western three governments' plan to hold the Bermuda meeting once again proves the bankruptcy of the "policy of strength" that US diplomats, headed by Dulles, have been advocating.

Before the foreign ministers of the three countries held their meeting, British newspapers had openly expressed dissatisfaction with the US plan to hold this Washington meeting. For example, the "Sunday Times" pointed out: the Washington meeting will not be a meeting held by the three countries on an equal footing, but just the host receiving his two servants separately at home. The American ruling clique demands complete control over the foreign policies of Western European countries and forces these countries to adopt policies that further exacerbate the international situation. US Secretary of State Dulles specifically demanded that Britain and France participate in the United States' subversive activities against democratic camp countries, namely, preparing and carrying out new shameful activities of this kind after the provocations in Berlin and by Syngman Rhee. However, maintaining and further exacerbating international tensions can only make these countries more economically and politically dependent on the United States.

This is the international situation at the opening of the Western three foreign ministers' meeting, which proves that the policies of those who intend to disregard the people's desire for peace and the peaceful resolution of international issues are hopeless.

   “消息报”外交观察家评美英法三外长会议
    美英之间在解决各种国际问题的办法上的分歧非常厉害
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：“消息报”外交观察家麦·米哈伊洛夫著文评论十日开始在华盛顿举行的美、英、法三国外长会议。
    文章说：这次会议是在这三个国家政府领袖的百慕大会议无限期延期以后才举行的。美国和它的英、法伙伴关系中目前的困难笼罩着这次会议。这些困难并没有因为改变了开会地点和参与人而有所减轻。正确地说，由于华盛顿、伦敦与巴黎之间分歧加深而引起的这些困难，使得美国统治集团认为百慕大会议的没有开成是一件值得欢迎的事。美国认识到在解决各种国际问题的办法上分歧非常厉害，首先是美英之间的分歧非常厉害，即使举行一次政府首脑之间平常的会议也不能消除这些分歧，它便对百慕大会议失去了兴趣。
    华盛顿的政客们不得不注意到他们是否能达到他们为百慕大会议规定的目标——组织一个西方三国的反苏阴谋，以维持国际紧张局势，并使它恶化——还是疑问；美国想削弱西欧要求在与苏联协商的基础上解决国际问题的运动，但没有成功。华盛顿不得不承认，它为举行大国会议规定先决条件的企图，已被广大的公众和头脑清醒的政治家们认为是不切实际的。
    西方三国政府首脑举行百慕大会议计划的失败，又一次证明了以杜勒斯为首的美国外交官所一直鼓吹的“强权政策”的破产。
    在三国外长举行会议以前，英国报纸已经公开地表示不满意美国举行这次华盛顿会议的计划。譬如“星期日泰晤士报”指出：华盛顿会议并不会是一个三国以平等地位举行的会议，只不过是主人坐在家里分别接见他的两个仆从而已。美国统治集团要求对西欧国家的外交政策有完全的控制权，并强迫这些国家采取使国际局势更加恶化的政策。美国国务卿杜勒斯更特别要求英国和法国参加美国对民主阵营国家的破坏活动，即在柏林和李承晚的挑衅之后，准备并进行新的可耻的这种活动。但是，维持国际紧张局势并使它进一步恶化，只能使这些国家在经济和政治上更加依赖美国。
    这就是西方三国外长会议开幕时的国际形势，这证明那些打算不顾各国人民要求和平、要求和平解决国际问题的愿望的人的政策，是没有希望的。
