    Earnestly Strengthen Safety Technology Work in Factories and Mines

    Safety technology work is a very important task in factories and mines. Only by doing a good job in safety technology can we ensure production safety and the smooth completion of national production and basic construction plans. In recent years, we have made achievements in this regard. The overall trend of employee casualties has been declining year by year, and labor conditions have also been gradually improving. The problem of high temperatures in workshops, which has existed in the textile system for many years, has been basically resolved; the dangerous operations in the Anshan Small Steel Rolling Mill have been greatly improved. Since the beginning of this year, the coal mine system of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry and the units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, as well as Beijing, Tianjin, and other places, have convened special safety technology and labor protection conferences to arrange this year's work. However, from a national perspective, many safety accidents have still occurred, and in some units, safety accidents have even increased compared to last year. Safety technology work is still a weak link in enterprise management. This situation must attract the attention of all comrades in all factories and mines.

    Analyzing the causes of many accidents, the first is due to uneven production, due to the front-loaded and then relaxed nature of production and basic construction projects, fluctuating between tight and loose. This has led many units to violate operating procedures and safety regulations in the process of rushing to complete production tasks, causing employees to overwork, and leaders to neglect inspection, making many accidents that could have been avoided difficult to avoid. Secondly, it is due to a lack of safety education, lax labor discipline, and a failure to implement safety regulations and systems. According to statistics from several units, more than 40% of casualties are directly caused by these reasons. This situation has become a serious problem in safety technology work. As enterprises develop rapidly, the proportion of new workers increases rapidly, and there is a lack of necessary production and safety knowledge, this problem becomes even more serious. At the same time, many accidents are also caused by the fact that many enterprises have not taken necessary and feasible measures to improve dust, high temperatures, toxic substances, dangerous equipment, and dangerous areas. On the one hand, many units have not rationally used the state's investment in safety. For example, by the first quarter of this year, Benxi Coal and Iron Company had only used 2.1 billion yuan out of its 22.1 billion yuan safety fund; many factories and mines in Northeast and East China also have this situation. On the other hand, rationalization proposals related to mechanization, automation, and closed devices, as well as the advanced experiences of various factories, have not been well promoted. In addition, the safety technology organizations in enterprises are still very incomplete, and some have not even been established; those that have safety technology organizations are weak in strength, cadres are frequently transferred, work is not stable, they are not proficient in their business, and their responsibilities are not clear; safety technology departments also have many problems in their working methods, so safety technology professional organizations have not fully played their due role. These are also the causes of many accidents.

    In order to effectively improve the current safety technology situation in factories and mines and implement the policy of safe production, all enterprises must carry out safety production publicity and education work and establish correct ideas about safe production; on this basis, establish a safety technology responsibility system. As long as the party, administration, trade union, and youth league work together in the enterprise and do these tasks well, the safety situation of the enterprise can be changed. In order to effectively improve the current safety technology situation in factories and mines, we must do the following:

    First, establish an administrative leadership safety technology responsibility system. It should be affirmed that safety issues in enterprises should first be the responsibility of administrative leaders at all levels, namely factory directors, mine managers, workshop directors, pit leaders, and team leaders. The practice of entrusting safety work only to a few safety technology cadres is wrong. Facts have proven that where the main administrative cadres do not personally attend to safety technology work, safety technology work cannot be done well. Leading organs of enterprises at all levels should assist lower levels in establishing specific working systems in this regard and persist in them. For example, major cadres should regularly hold safety work meetings, conduct regular safety inspections, regularly report and report on safety conditions, and major administrative cadres at all levels should regularly handle safety issues. These should be stipulated as regular working systems.

    Second, formulate and implement safety technology regulations. Enterprises that do not yet have safety technology regulations should immediately start formulating them; enterprises that already have safety technology regulations should further revise them based on changes in production conditions. These regulations should be very specific, and after they are stipulated, thorough education and organization work must be carried out so that these regulations are effectively grasped by employees. Once these regulations are established, they should be regarded as the enterprise's laws and regulations to ensure their implementation. Rewards and punishments should be given promptly based on how well the regulations are implemented.

    Third, strengthen safety technology education. The safety technology organizations of each factory and mine should assign special personnel to be responsible for carrying out safety education work, and combine it with the personnel and attendance system to formulate a certain education system. After new workers enter the factory, they must undergo preliminary safety technology education, and only after obtaining proof that they have received education can the personnel department assign them work. After new workers arrive at the site, the workshop and pit leaders should teach them to pay attention to safety issues at their work posts and designate veteran workers to educate them, implementing a method of unity, mutual assistance, and comprehensive teaching and learning between new and old workers. In addition, regular safety education should also be promoted. Currently, some enterprises have adopted a 15-minute safety education system before work, and some set aside one day every ten days or half a month as a "safety activity day." These are simple and easy-to-implement methods and should be promoted. The Dalian Chemical Factory and other units have adopted a regular safety examination system, stipulating that those who fail the examination can be given one chance for a make-up examination, and if they still fail, their work will be transferred; no personnel without a safety operation certificate are allowed to enter the site for operation. This method is also practical and feasible.

    Fourth, establish and improve safety technology organizations. In all larger state-owned enterprises, safety technology functional organizations should be established without exception to be specifically responsible for safety technology work and conduct safety work inspections. This is one of the important guarantees for doing a good job in safety technology work. For enterprises that already have safety technology organizations, leading cadres should regularly check their work, solve the difficulties in their work, and clearly stipulate their responsibilities. In general, their work should be fixed so that they can delve into their business. Senior leading organs should hold training courses to gradually improve the professional level of safety technology personnel; in addition, they should also help safety technology responsible cadres overcome negative and impetuous emotions, improve the enterprise's safety work in a planned and step-by-step manner, and truly give play to their role.

    Fifth, promote the advanced experience of safety technology work. According to the conditions of each enterprise, the more common problems that endanger the safety of employees are nothing more than dust, high heat, toxic gases, toxic substances, roof falls and side collapses, blasting and drilling, and mechanical and electrical injuries. And it is precisely on these issues that we have accumulated some good experience in safety technology in recent years. For example, we have experience in the textile system in reducing workshop temperatures, the Anshan Small Steel Rolling Mill has created mechanicalization experience, as well as wet drilling experience, preventing high temperatures, insulation, ventilation experience, dust-proof and sealed experience, the experience of using safety belts for high-altitude operations, and so on. As long as we are good at grasping and promoting these experiences, continue to learn from the Soviet Union's experience, we may be able to solve many major safety problems and further improve the safety situation of enterprises.

    Doing a good job in safety technology work is an important guarantee for the smooth completion of our production and basic construction tasks. At the same time, we should take the quality of the enterprise's safety situation as one of the criteria for measuring the quality of enterprise management. Safety technology work is an organic component of the entire enterprise management work, and it will improve with the improvement of the entire enterprise management level. Therefore, safety technology work is a long-term and arduous task that must be carried out with leadership, planning, and step-by-step. If only a few safety tasks at hand are arranged and handled, or if a sudden effort is made only when accidents are serious, it is obviously impossible to solve the problem, and therefore it is also wrong. We should constantly improve our enterprise management level, first of all, consolidate the establishment of the production responsibility system, strengthen production planning, and achieve balanced production; constantly improve unreasonable and unsafe production methods, promote the mechanicalization method of Anshan Small Steel Rolling Mill, and gradually replace heavy and unsafe manual labor with the mechanization of various production activities; constantly strengthen the political work and education work of enterprises to gradually improve the political, scientific, cultural, and technical level of employees. This is the constant direction of our safety technology work. This is the glorious task of all our factory and mine workers.

    认真加强工厂矿山的安全技术工作
    安全技术工作是工厂矿山中一项十分重要的工作。只有做好安全技术工作才能保证生产安全和国家生产与基本建设计划的顺利完成。几年来在这一方面，我们的工作是有成绩的，职工伤亡事故总的趋势是逐年下降的，劳动条件也在逐步改善。纺织系统存在多年的车间高温问题已基本上获得解决；鞍山小型轧钢厂过去那种危险的作业已大为改善。今年以来，中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿系统和重工业部各单位以及北京天津等地，都曾召开了专门的安全技术和劳动保护会议，布置了今年的工作。但是，从全国范围来看，安全事故仍然发生了不少，有些单位的安全事故甚至比去年还增加了。安全技术工作仍然是企业管理工作中薄弱的一个环节。这种情况必须引起所有工厂矿山的全体同志们的注意。
    分析许多事故发生的原因，首先是由于生产不均衡，由于生产和基本建设工程前松后紧，忽松忽紧。这就使得不少单位在突击完成生产任务的过程中，大量发生违反操作规程和安全规程，职工操劳过度，领导疏于检查等现象，使得许多本来可以避免的事故也难于避免了。其次是由于缺乏安全教育，劳动纪律松懈，安全规程制度没有贯彻执行。根据若干单位统计，伤亡事故发生的直接原因百分之四十以上是由于以上这些原因。这种情况已成为安全技术工作中的一个严重问题。当着企业迅速发展，新工人比重迅速增加而又缺乏必要的生产与安全知识的今天，这个问题就显得更加严重。同时，有许多事故发生的原因还在于不少企业对于粉尘、高温、有毒物质、容易发生危险的设备、容易发生危险的地区，还没有采取必要和可行的办法加以改善。一方面是有不少单位没有合理使用国家在安全方面的投资。比如本溪煤铁公司截至今年第一季为止，在二百二十一亿元的安全经费中，只用去二十一亿元；东北、华东不少厂矿也都有这种情况。另一方面是对于有关机械化、自动化、密闭装置等合理化建议及各厂先进经验没有很好加以推广。此外，企业中的安全技术组织机构还很不健全，甚至有的还没有建立；已有安全技术组织的，力量也很薄弱，干部经常调换，工作不安心，业务不熟练，职责不明确；安全技术部门在工作方法上也还存在着许多问题，因而安全技术专业机构还没有充分发挥其应有的作用。这些也是许多事故发生的原因。
    为了切实改善目前工厂矿山的安全技术状况，贯彻安全生产的方针，各个企业必须开展安全生产的宣传教育工作，树立正确的安全生产的思想；在这个基础上建立安全技术责任制。只要企业中党的、行政的、工会的、青年团的各方面工作配合一致，把这些工作做好了，企业的安全状况就可以改观。为了切实改善目前工厂矿山的安全技术状况，我们必须做好下列几个方面的工作：
    第一，建立行政领导的安全技术责任制。应当肯定企业中的安全问题首先应由各级行政领导干部，即厂长、矿长、车间主任、坑长、班组长等负责。那种把安全工作只交给少数安全技术干部去负责的作法是错误的。事实证明，那里的主要行政干部不亲自过问安全技术工作，那里的安全技术工作就不可能做好。各级企业领导机关应当协助下级在这方面建立一些具体的工作制度，并坚持下去。比如由主要干部定期召开安全工作会议，定期进行安全检查，定期汇报与报告安全情况，各级主要行政干部定期专门处理安全问题，这些都应该规定为经常的工作制度。
    第二，制订和贯彻执行安全技术规程。凡是现在还没有安全技术规程的企业，应立即着手制订；过去已有安全技术规程的企业，应进一步根据生产情况的改变而加以修订。这种规程应该规定得很具体，规定之后就必须进行周密的教育和组织工作，使得这些规程切实为职工所掌握。这些规程一经订立就应该做为企业的法规，保证它的贯彻执行。规程执行得好坏，应及时进行奖惩。
    第三，加强安全技术教育。各工厂矿山的安全技术机构应设专人负责进行安全教育工作，并与人事及考勤制度相结合，订出一定的教育制度。新工人入厂后必须经过初步的安全技术教育，取得业已受了教育的证明之后，才能由人事部门分配工作。新工人到达现场以后，应由车间、坑口负责人教导他们注意工作岗位上的安全问题，并指定老工人对他们进行教育，实行新老工人团结互助、包教包学的办法。此外还应该推行定时的安全教育。目前有些企业采用上班前十五分钟的安全教育制，也有的每十天或半个月抽出一天做为“安全活动日”。这些都是简明易行的方法，应当提倡。大连化工厂等单位采取定期安全考试制度，规定凡考试不合格者可给
    一次补考机会，如仍不及格，则调动其工作；没有安全作业证明的任何人员不准进入现场操作。这种办法也是切实可行的。
    第四，建立和健全安全技术组织。在所有较大的国营企业里都应该毫无例外地建立起安全技术的职能机构，使它专门负责安全技术工作，进行安全工作检查。这是做好安全技术工作的重要保证条件之
    一。已经有了安全技术机构的企业，领导干部应经常检查他们的工作，解决他们工作中的困难，明确规定他们的职责。一般应把他们的工作固定下来，使他们能钻研业务。高级领导机关应举办训练班逐步提高安全技术人员的业务水平；此外还要帮助安全技术专责干部，克服消极和急躁情绪，有计划有步骤地改善企业的安全工作，真正发挥他们的作用。
    第五，推广安全技术工作的先进经验。根据各企业情况，目前危害职工安全的比较普遍的问题不外是粉尘、高热、有毒气体、有毒物质、冒顶片帮、放炮打眼以及机电造成的伤害。而正是在这些问题上，几年来我们已经积累了一些安全技术方面的良好经验。例如，我们在纺织系统中已经有了降低车间温度的经验，鞍山小型轧钢厂创造了机械化的经验，还有湿式凿岩的经验，防止高温、隔热、通风的经验，防尘密闭的经验，高空作业使用安全带的经验等等。只要我们善于抓住并推广这些经验，继续学习苏联的经验，我们就可能解决很多重大的安全问题，使企业的安全状况获得进一步的改善。
    作好安全技术工作，是我们的生产和基本建设任务顺利完成的重要保证。同时我们应该把企业安全状况的好坏作为测定企业管理好坏的标准之一。安全技术工作是整个企业管理工作的一个有机组成部分，它将随着整个企业管理水平的提高而提高。因此安全技术工作是一个长期的艰巨的任务，必须有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行。如果只把眼前的几项安全工作加以安排处理，或者只在事故严重时突击一下，显然是不能解决问题，因而也是不对的。我们应当经常不断地提高我们企业管理水平，首先是巩固地建立生产责任制，加强生产计划性，做到均衡生产；不断地改善不合理、不安全的生产方法，推广鞍山小型轧钢厂机械化的方法，逐渐以各种生产活动的机械化来代替笨重的不安全的体力劳动；不断地加强企业的政治工作和教育工作，以逐渐提高职工的政治、科学、文化和技术的水平。这是我们安全技术工作的经常努力方向。这是我们所有的工厂矿山的工作者的光荣任务。
