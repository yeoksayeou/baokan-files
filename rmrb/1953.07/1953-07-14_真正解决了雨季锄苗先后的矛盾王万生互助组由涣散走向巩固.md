    The Wang Wansheng Mutual Aid Team Truly Solved the Contradiction of Prioritizing Weeding in the Rainy Season, Transforming from Dispersed to Consolidated

    When weeding began this year, the members of the Wang Wansheng Mutual Aid Team in the third district of Xiyang County, Shanxi, all wanted to weed their own fields first, which led to disputes. Because the issue of weeding priorities could not be resolved, the team members began working independently.

    The district cadres were very concerned about this situation and inspired everyone to recall the summer of 1951. That summer, there were also continuous rains, and the weeds in the fields grew as tall as the seedlings. Everyone wanted to weed their own seedlings first, but because there were few people and limited strength, the weeding was scattered, and in the end, everyone's fields were overgrown. Afterwards, everyone regretted not organizing themselves and leveraging the power of collective labor. This year, there is also a lot of rain, and the weeds are very large. If they don't organize themselves again, it will be like 1951. The members of the Wang Wansheng Mutual Aid Team realized that only by doing a good job of mutual aid can they avoid wasting land, so they further展开民主讨论，解决先锄后锄的矛盾。 They first calculated that the team had twenty-three laborers in total and determined the task of weeding forty mu of corn seedlings and thirty mu of millet seedlings in five days. Based on five factors – planting order, land quality, crop size, amount of weeds, and soil moisture – they had each household report their situation and then democratically discussed and decided on the weeding priorities. At the same time, they stipulated that after rain, work should be done on "oily sand" land and "stony upland" land; if weeds were not killed during weeding, they must be killed during the next weeding. After such discussions and stipulations, not only was the issue of weeding priorities resolved, but also the confusion in labor utilization and the phenomenon of work stoppages were overcome. Everyone was very satisfied after the meeting. Team member Wang Liangke said, "It's really good to do it this way. If we had this method earlier, we wouldn't have fallen apart." On this basis, they also re-established reasonable scoring and work point recording methods. In this way, a dispersed mutual aid team was consolidated again.

    真正解决了雨季锄苗先后的矛盾王万生互助组由涣散走向巩固
    今年开始锄苗时，山西昔阳县三区王万生互助组的组员们都想先给自己锄，这样就发生了争执。锄苗先后的问题解决不了，这个组就各干各的了。
    区干部看到这种情况，很着急，便启发大家回忆一九五一年夏天的情况。那年夏天也是霪雨连绵，地里的草长的和苗一般高。大家都想先把自己的苗锄出来，结果因为人少力小，锄了这一块那一块就荒了，到头来大家都把地荒了。事后大家都后悔不该没有组织起来，发挥集体做活的力量。今年雨水也多，草也很大，如果再不组织起来，还会像一九五一年一样。王万生互助组的组员们认识到只有搞好互助才能不荒地的道理，就进一步展开民主讨论，解决先锄后锄的矛盾。他们首先计算，全组共有二十三个劳力，确定了五天锄玉米苗四十亩、谷苗三十亩的任务。他们根据播种先后、土地好坏、庄稼大小、杂草多少、土地干湿五个条件，让各户自报，然后民主评议，决定锄苗的先后。同时规定下雨后要到“油砂”地和“石渣上岗地”做活；锄苗时如果杂草没死掉，下次锄苗时就一定要锄死。经过这样的讨论和规定，既解决了锄苗先后问题，又克服了劳力使用混乱和窝工现象。会后大家都很满意。组员王良科说：“这样办真是好，早有这办法，咱们就不会散伙。”在这个基础上，他们又重新规定了合理的评分记工办法。这样一个涣散的互助组就又巩固起来了。
