Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 5th: The second phase of large-scale basic construction projects in Northeast China will commence one after another, with efforts to begin construction on over one million square meters of building projects in July. Currently, the preparatory work for various projects has entered its most intense phase. Staff at various design departments are working diligently to create design blueprints; the design of many projects has already been completed, and the blueprints have been sent to various construction units. Materials for various construction needs, such as cement, rebar, and steel, as well as construction machinery like mixers, vacuum pumps, electric welding machines, and hoists, are being transported to various construction sites. At many of the sites about to commence operations, brand new temporary facilities have been built successively.

The construction volume of the second phase of basic construction projects in Northeast China accounts for approximately one-half of the entire year's volume. Among them, in addition to general construction projects such as schools, hospitals, and dormitories, there are also many key national industrial construction projects such as cable factories, machine tool manufacturing plants, steel mills, power plants, and high-voltage power transmission lines. To ensure that these more important and complex projects meet the requirements of "good, fast, and economical," the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of construction engineering bureaus from various provinces and cities in mid-June. The meeting summarized the work of the first half of the year, stipulated the tasks for the third quarter, and pointed out that July and August are the most critical periods for completing the annual tasks. It required all affiliated companies to conduct in-depth inspections of construction preparations, to seize the design work, to strengthen material supply, and to properly allocate labor. The inspection team organized by the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration's First Engineering Company also recently went deep into various construction sites to inspect the construction preparation situation and assisted each construction site in specifically resolving existing problems and difficulties in materials, transportation, and temporary facilities, enabling some projects to start ahead of schedule. The carpentry processing factory of the Benxi First Engineering Office launched a responsibility system movement in conjunction with preparation work, reversing the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the work, thereby advancing the construction preparation work a step forward.

    东北第二期基本建设工程即将陆续开工
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北区第二期规模巨大的基本建设工程将要陆续开工，七月份即将争取一百多万平方公尺的建筑工程开工。目前各项工程的施工准备工作已进入最紧张的阶段，各个设计部门的工作人员正在加紧绘制设计图纸；很多工程的设计已经完成；设计图纸也已送到各施工单位。供各种建设用的水泥、铁筋、钢材等材料和搅拌机、真空泵、电焊机、卷扬机等施工机械，正陆续运往各个施工现场。在许多就要开工的工地上，一座座崭新的暂设工程都已先后修建起来。
    东北区第二期基本建设工程施工量约占全年的二分之一。其中除一般学校、医院、宿舍等建筑工程外，还有许多国家工业建设的重点工程如电缆厂、工作母机制造厂、炼钢厂、发电厂、高压送电线路等。为了保证这些更重要的复杂的工程达到“好、快、省”的要求，东北建筑工程局曾在六月中旬召开了各省、市建筑工程局局长会议，总结了上半年工作，规定了第三季度的任务，指出七、八月份是完成全年任务的最紧要时期，要求所属各公司在施工准备方面必须深入检查，抓紧设计工作，加强材料供应，做好劳动力的调配等。东北有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司组织的检查组，也于最近深入各个工地检查了施工准备情况，并协助各工地具体解决了在材料、运输、暂设工程等方面所存在的问题和困难，使一些工程得到提前开工。本溪第一工程处木制加工厂结合准备工作开展建立责任制运动，扭转了工作无人负责现象，从而把施工准备工作向前推进了一步。
