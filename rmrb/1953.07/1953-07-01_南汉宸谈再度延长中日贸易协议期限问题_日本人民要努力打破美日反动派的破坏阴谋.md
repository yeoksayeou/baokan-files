Xinhua News Agency, 30th.

Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, made the following statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the re-extension of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement:

The Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, signed in June 1952 and extended in December of the same year, expired on June 30th. Recently, we received a telegram from Mr. Suzuki Kazuo, Executive Director of the Sino-Japanese Trade Promotion Association, forwarded by the Tokyo Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference and the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, requesting an extension of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Mr. Kora Tomi, Mr. Hosoki Kei, and Mr. Miyakoshi Kisuke, who signed the original agreement, also sent telegrams requesting a further extension. After considering the requests from the Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference and the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, we have agreed to extend the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement signed in June 1952 for another six months, until the end of 1953.

People will inevitably ask: The Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has been in effect for a year since it was signed. The Chinese side has made great efforts to implement this agreement, and the vast majority of the Japanese people are extremely eager for Sino-Japanese trade. So, why is it that the volume of transactions concluded in the year since the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed is still far from the total amount stipulated in the agreement?

The facts are very clear. The reason for this is none other than the fact that US monopoly capital, in order to pursue maximum profits, is turning Japan into a US colony, monopolizing the Japanese market, and making Japan a US "arsenal" for preparing aggressive wars in the Far East. Therefore, it prohibits and sabotages trade between China and Japan. The Yoshida government of Japan, disregarding Japan's economic interests and the urgent demands of the Japanese people, submits to the dictates of its US masters and tries every possible means to obstruct trade between China and Japan. After some Japanese traders signed contracts with Chinese trading companies, the US-Japanese reactionaries did everything possible to prevent them from fulfilling the contracts and used intimidation against Japanese banks and manufacturers. The first trade contract signed by the Japanese Ba Shoji Company with our side is a clear example of how it was sabotaged, causing losses to the Chinese trading company. The Yoshida government, obeying the US and participating in the "embargo," limited the scope of Japanese exports to China, which greatly reduced the possibility of Sino-Japanese trade. All Class A materials and most of Class B materials stipulated in the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement for export from the Japanese side have been placed on the "embargo" list. This has made the range of Japanese export goods very narrow and impossible to fully implement the agreement. This is the biggest obstacle to the development of Sino-Japanese trade at present.

Although the Yoshida government has had to verbally beg its US masters to "relax" the export restrictions on some commodities in the face of the Japanese people's movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade, in an attempt to ease the emotions of the Japanese people, the "relaxed" materials are mostly not needed by China and are of no benefit to the realization of Sino-Japanese trade. Another conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries is to use Sino-Japanese trade to sabotage Sino-Japanese trade. That is to say, they prohibit the export to China of materials that China needs, and encourage the export to China of materials that China does not need and have little economic value, in an attempt to exchange them for imports of materials with high economic value, in order to create chaos among the Japanese people and in business circles and to sow discord between the Chinese and Japanese people. This should arouse serious vigilance among those in Japan who are enthusiastic about promoting Sino-Japanese trade.

We reiterate that the People's Republic of China has always been willing to establish normal trade relations with Japan and all countries on the basis of mutual benefit and equality. In the past three or four years, the foreign trade of the People's Republic of China has undergone unprecedented development, fundamentally changing the position of old China in foreign trade relations. Unequal trade relations that were not mutually beneficial in the past are gone forever. First of all, China has established close relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in the world democratic market. China has also signed trade agreements and trade contracts with Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Finland, France, and other countries, with relatively good results. A British industrial and commercial trade delegation has also recently arrived in China to conduct trade negotiations. The US "embargo" and "blockade" have not harmed China; on the contrary, they have harmed the capitalist countries themselves.

China and Japan are relatively close, and it was originally possible to rebuild post-war Sino-Japanese trade on a new basis of mutual benefit and equality. However, the facts of the past year have proved that without breaking the US-Japanese reactionaries' "embargo," "blockade," obstruction, sabotage, and conspiracies, Sino-Japanese trade cannot be developed smoothly. We believe that the peace-loving Japanese people will make further efforts to eliminate the above-mentioned obstacles to Sino-Japanese trade. Then, the future of Sino-Japanese trade is still promising.

### 南汉宸谈再度延长中日贸易协议期限问题  日本人民要努力打破美日反动派的破坏阴谋

    南汉宸谈再度延长中日贸易协议期限问题
    日本人民要努力打破美日反动派的破坏阴谋
    【新华社三十日讯】中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸，就中日贸易协议有效期限再度延长问题，对新华社记者发表谈话如下：
    一九五二年六月签订、同年十二月延期的中日贸易协议于六月三十日期满。最近我们接到中日贸易促进会常务理事铃木一雄先生转来东京日中贸易促进会议和日本中日贸易促进会电报，请求延长中日贸易协议的期限。原协议上签字的高良富、帆足计、宫腰喜助三先生也有电报来要求再延期。我们考虑了日本日中贸易促进会议和日本中日贸易促进会的请求后，同意将一九五二年六月签订的中日贸易协议再延长半年，至一九五三年年底为止。
    人们必然会问：中日贸易协议自签订以来，一年的时间已经过去了，中国方面为实现这一协议，曾作了很大的努力，而日本的广大人民要求中日贸易又极其殷切，那么，为什么在中日贸易协议签订后一年时间中，成交的数目仍然和协议所订的总额距离甚远呢？
    事实是很清楚的。其原因不是别的，而是由于美国垄断资本为了追求最高利润，变日本为美国的殖民地，垄断日本市场，并使日本成为美国在远东准备侵略战争的“兵工厂”，因此禁止和破坏中日间的贸易；而日本的吉田政府不顾日本经济利益和日本人民的迫切要求，听任美国主人的摆布，也千方百计地阻挠中日间贸易。在某些日本贸易商与中国的贸易公司签订合同后，美日反动派则百般阻挠其履行合同，并对日本的银行和厂商施行恫吓手段。日本巴商事公司与我方签订的第一个贸易合同，就是因此遭到破坏而使中国的贸易公司受到损失的一个明显例子。吉田政府听命美国参加“禁运”，限制日本对中国出口物资的范围，这样就大大缩小了中日贸易的可能。中日贸易协议中所规定的日方输出的全部甲类物资及极大部分的乙类物资，一直被放在“禁运”之列。这样就使日本出口物资的范围非常狭窄，而无法全面实现协议。这就是目前中日贸易发展道路上的最大障碍。
    吉田政府在日本人民促进中日贸易运动面前，虽然不得不口头上乞求美国主子“放宽”一些商品的出口限制，企图以此缓和日本人民的情绪。然而“放宽”的物资绝大多数是中国所不需要的，对实现中日贸易无所裨益。美日反动派的另一阴谋是借中日贸易来破坏中日贸易，这就是说他们禁止向中国输出中国所需要的物资，而鼓励将中国不需要的、没有什么经济价值的物资向中国出口，来企图换得经济价值很高的物资入口，以便在日本人民中、工商界中制造混乱和挑拨中日人民间的友谊。这一点应该引起日本热心于促进中日贸易的人士们严重警惕。
    我们再一次声明，中华人民共和国一向愿意在互利、平等的基础上与日本及一切国家建立正常的贸易关系。近三四年来中华人民共和国的对外贸易有了空前的发展，根本改变了过去旧中国在对外贸易关系中的地位，过去历史上不互利、不平等的贸易关系是一去不复返了。首先，就是中国与苏联及人民民主国家在世界民主市场中建立了密切的关系。中国又与锡兰、印度、巴基斯坦、芬兰、法国等等国家签订了贸易协议与贸易合同，得到较为良好的成绩。英国工商业贸易代表团最近也到达中国，进行贸易谈判。美国的“禁运”、“封锁”并没有损害中国，相反的，却损害了资本主义国家自己。
    中国与日本距离较近，本来可以在新的互利、平等的基础上重建战后的中日贸易。然而一年来的事实证明，不打破美日反动派的“禁运”、“封锁”、阻挠、破坏和阴谋，中日贸易是不可能顺利开展的。我们相信爱好和平的日本人民定会作更进一步的努力，消除上述中日贸易的障碍，那末，中日贸易的前途，还是有希望的。
