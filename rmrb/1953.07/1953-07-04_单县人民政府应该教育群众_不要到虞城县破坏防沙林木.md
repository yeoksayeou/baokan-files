Reader's Letters Abstract

    Shanxian People's Government Should Educate the Masses
    Not to Damage Sandbreak Forest in Yucheng County
    Reader Guo Lifei writes: The old Yellow River course on the northern border of Yucheng County, Henan Province, is more than 80 *li* long, with a sandy wasteland area of over 200,000 *mu*. In order to relieve farmers from wind and sand disasters, the Yucheng County People's Government mobilized the masses to plant windbreak and sand-fixing shelterbelts in the sandy wasteland. From the winter of 1951 to now, more than 1.8 million trees have been planted. Shanxian County in Shandong Province borders our county, but the Shanxian County People's Government does not pay enough attention to forest protection work. Some people in that county keep coming to our county to cut down trees, and according to statistics, more than 20,000 trees have been damaged. The forest protection personnel in Yucheng County have reported this to the district and township governments in Shanxian County, but no action or response has been seen. The Yucheng County People's Government has also sent official letters and dispatched cadres to contact the Shanxian County People's Government several times, but the Shanxian County People's Government has adopted a delaying and perfunctory attitude. I suggest that the Shanxian County People's Government should immediately pay attention to forest protection work and educate the masses to jointly protect the forests with the people of Yucheng County.

    单县人民政府应该教育群众
    不要到虞城县破坏防沙林木
    读者郭力飞来信：河南省虞城县北界旧黄河故道，长八十余里，沙荒面积达二十余万亩。为了解除农民风沙灾害，虞城县人民政府就发动群众在沙荒地带营造防风防沙保安林。自一九五一年冬到现在，已造林一百八十余万株。山东单县与我县接壤，该县人民政府对护林工作重视不够。该县有一些群众不断来我县砍伐林木，据统计已破坏两万余株。虞城县护林群众报告单县区乡政府，但未见一次处理与答复。虞城县人民政府亦曾几次去公函及派干部与单县人民政府联系，单县人民政府也采取推拖应付的态度。我建议单县人民政府应该立即重视护林工作，教育群众与虞城县人民共同保护森林。
