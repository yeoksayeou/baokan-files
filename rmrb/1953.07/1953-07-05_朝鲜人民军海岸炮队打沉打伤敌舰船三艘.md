Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th. According to the Korean Central News Agency, after sinking several enemy destroyers and minesweepers on June 14th, the Xu Lejiu coastal artillery sub-division of the Korean People's Army, which defends a certain coastline, sank and damaged three enemy ships on June 17th.

On the morning of June 17th, several enemy warships approached the coast defended by the Xu Lejiu coastal artillery sub-division and began to fire wildly at the shore. At this time, the well-prepared People's Army artillery commanders, Park Ya-jin and Li Wan-hee, directed their respective coastal guns to accurately fire at the enemy ships. Within a few minutes, they hit the enemy destroyers No. 785 and No. 794 and a transport ship. To cover these enemy ships, the enemy destroyers behind them intensified their shelling of the shore. The enemy also dispatched planes, attempting to help the enemy ships suppress the fire from the shore. However, the heroic People's Army coastal artillerymen, in coordination with the anti-aircraft machine gunners, continued to fiercely bombard the enemy ships, and another eight shells hit the enemy destroyer No. 785. This enemy ship immediately emitted thick smoke. The wounded enemy transport ship next to it could not escape and was sunk by the rain of shells. The enemy destroyer No. 794 was then hit by another three shells. The remaining enemy ships turned around and fled, narrowly escaping. The battle ended in just over an hour. The coastal artillerymen sank and damaged three enemy ships. At the same time, the anti-aircraft machine gunners bravely covered the coastal artillerymen in their operations, shooting down one enemy plane.

    朝鲜人民军海岸炮队打沉打伤敌舰船三艘
    【新华社平壤四日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：坚守某海岸线的朝鲜人民军许乐九海岸炮区分队，在六月十四日打沉敌驱逐舰和扫雷艇数艘之后，又在六月十七日打沉和打伤敌舰船三艘。
    六月十七日早晨，敌舰船多艘驶近许乐九海岸炮区分队防守的海岸，向岸上进行疯狂的射击。这时，早有准备的人民军朴雅镇、李琓熙两炮长便分别指挥各自的海岸炮，向敌舰准确地发射炮火，只几分钟就打中了敌七八五号和七九四号驱逐舰两艘和运输船一艘。在它们后面的几艘敌驱逐舰为了掩护这几艘敌舰船，加紧向岸上轰击。敌人还出动了飞机，企图帮助敌舰来压制岸上的火力。但英勇的人民军海岸炮兵们在高射机枪手们的配合下，继续向敌舰进行猛烈的轰击，又有八发炮弹打中了敌七八五号驱逐舰。这艘敌舰立刻冒出了浓烟。旁边的那艘受伤的敌运输船来不及逃跑，就被雨点似的炮弹打沉了。敌七九四号驱逐舰舰身上接着又中了三发炮弹。其余的敌舰掉头就跑，才侥幸逃脱。战斗只经过一个多小时就宣告结束。海岸炮兵们共打沉和打伤敌舰船三艘。同时，高射机枪手们英勇地掩护海岸炮兵们作战，打落了敌机一架。
