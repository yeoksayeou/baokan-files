Studying Stalin's "Speech at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League"

    Comrade Stalin's brilliant instructions on the youth movement are very close to the hearts of Chinese youth. As early as 1926, he made a profound analysis and instruction on the Chinese youth movement in his article "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution." He said, "No one has experienced the oppression of imperialism as deeply and vividly as Chinese youth, and no one has felt as acutely and painfully the need to fight against this oppression." Therefore, he believed that the Chinese "student youth (revolutionary students), worker youth, and peasant youth—all these can greatly promote the forces of the revolution." The Chinese youth, following the path he pointed out, under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, became "an important army" in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, just as he said. They stood at the forefront of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, advancing wave upon wave, heroically dedicating everything they had, thereby helping the Party achieve the great victory of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao also made a correct assessment of their cause when he received the Presidium of the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. He said: The worker-peasant youth, the intellectual youth, and the youth in the army are heroic, active, and very disciplined. Without them, the revolutionary and construction causes cannot be victorious.
    Now, our country has completed social reforms and entered a great new historical period, that is, the country has entered the period of planned construction of the national economy from the period of restoration of the national economy. Our entire Youth League members and youth, together with the people of the whole country, should, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, instructed at the Second National Congress of the Youth League, shoulder the new historical task of "gradually realizing the industrialization of the country and, on this basis, gradually transitioning our motherland from New Democracy to Socialism," unite around the Party, and "stand at the forefront of the struggle for the industrialization of the country."
    Stalin's "Speech at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League," although not a direct teaching to Chinese youth, its extremely profound thoughts will equally give us significant inspiration and help us push the youth movement to a new historical period.
    In this document, Comrade Stalin talked about three issues.
    The first issue is to strengthen the combat readiness of the working class. The raising of this issue was in the year when the Soviet Union had built for five years under the conditions of peaceful development, without fighting foreign enemies or internal war factors, that is, in the year when the Soviet Union began to implement the first five-year plan. Through this issue, Comrade Stalin issued a warning against the mood of "everything will go smoothly" that was prevalent after the victory of the revolution. He believed that the complacency and paralyzing thoughts of complacency that grew out of excessive confidence in one's own strength and underestimation of the enemy's strength would give the enemy an opportunity to rise up against us (such as the Shakhty Affair), which would greatly damage our economic construction. Today, the large-scale construction of our motherland is being carried out under the conditions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and hidden enemies are constantly plotting to sabotage our construction. We should firmly remember this teaching. Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Commander-in-Chief Zhu also made important instructions to our national Youth League members and youth in this regard at the Second National Congress of the Youth League. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "Closely link the great cause of defending the motherland and building the motherland with the great cause of defending world peace, learn from the glorious example of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League, and continue to unite with the youth of the countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, as well as the advanced youth of other countries in the world, and bravely advance to defend world peace and strive for a better future for mankind!" Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: "I hope that the youth will train themselves to become active and conscious defenders and builders of the motherland." This is an important task for our Youth League members and youth at present. Comrade Stalin said: "As long as there are still classes in our country, as long as we are still surrounded by capitalist countries, this task should run through our entire work." Only in this way can we "consolidate the strength of the working class, its vigilance, its revolutionary spirit, and its combat readiness to oppose these enemies." This is the significance of strengthening the combat readiness of the working class.
    The second issue is to organize mass criticism from below. The raising of this issue is also closely related to the economic construction of the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin believed that if bureaucracy on the road to national construction is not eliminated, then all revolutionary organizations will be corrupted by the enemy, and "shameful facts of moral corruption and depravity" will occur, and it will not be possible to "awaken the masses, expose our shortcomings, and point out ways to improve our construction." And "there is no and cannot be any other way to oppose this poison except to organize mass supervision from the bottom up by the Party and cultivate democracy within the Party." Comrade Stalin's sharp raising of this issue powerfully pushed the cause of socialist construction forward. For the sake of the construction of our motherland, Chairman Mao also made brilliant instructions on the issue of carrying out criticism and self-criticism and opposing bureaucracy at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and this struggle has been widely carried out throughout the country, achieving great results. This struggle against bureaucracy is undoubtedly of great significance for educating youth with principled spirit and cultivating their noble qualities of resolutely fighting against phenomena that endanger the interests of the Party and the people. Comrade Liu Shaoqi made clear instructions on this at the Second National Congress of the Youth League. He said: "Youth League members must learn to use the method of criticism and self-criticism to fight against all bad phenomena that damage the cause of the people and the cause of the Party." According to the instructions of the Party, Article 2, Section 6 of Chapter 1 of the Youth League Constitution stipulates: "Abide by national laws, cherish public property, and fight against behaviors that endanger the interests of the people." To this end, our youth should become models of abiding by national laws, cherishing public property, and maintaining revolutionary order. We should be brave in correcting our mistakes; we should actively and sincerely make criticisms of the shortcomings and mistakes of any comrades and leading organs; we should dare to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all behaviors that endanger the interests of the people.
    The third issue is that youth should master science. This issue was raised in order to adapt to the great task of transforming the entire national economy that the Soviet Union was facing at that time, which required the cultivation of new construction talents. Comrade Stalin said: "To build, one must have knowledge, one must master science. And to have knowledge, one must study. Study stubbornly and patiently." "We have a fortress in front of us. This fortress is called science, and it has many, many departments of knowledge. We must take down this fortress no matter what." "Mastering science, training Bolshevik experts in all departments of knowledge, studying, studying, studying most stubbornly—this is the task now." If our youth can complete this task well, then we can become builders of a new life and become true replacements for the old guards. Comrade Stalin's valuable teachings to the youth were well implemented in the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the First National Congress of the Youth League on the issue of learning, and were enthusiastically supported by the Youth League organizations, all Youth League members, and the broad masses of youth throughout the country. At the Second National Congress of the Youth League, Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed on the issue of learning: "As the Party's assistant and reserve force, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and improve their level of communist awareness. Youth League members must strive to study the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, study various scientific knowledge, especially the advanced scientific and technological knowledge of the Soviet Union, study the knowledge of various policies of the Party and the state, and study the knowledge of various production businesses and various work businesses. Youth League members must always remember Lenin's teaching: study, study, and study again. This is the major task of Youth League members." Commander-in-Chief Zhu instructed us at the conference: "Youth League members should not only have a high degree of political awareness and communist moral qualities, but also become people with specialized knowledge and skills. Our youth must have sufficient culture and must actively master science and technology, which is absolutely necessary for building and defending our motherland." These instructions are very important, and the Party has placed the glorious task of learning on our young people. However, we must know that political learning and professional learning are a unity. Only those who truly have a communist worldview and morality can make progress in the learning of specialized knowledge and specialized business; and only by mastering specialized knowledge and specialized business can we make real contributions in the struggle to realize the communist cause. At the same time, we must also recognize that learning and work are closely linked. Experience has proven that the principle of "doing what you do, learning what you do" and "learning while doing, gradually improving" is correct. We must be good at using these experiences to complete the learning tasks assigned to us by the Party well.
    Let us, in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the resolutions of the Second National Congress of the Youth League, conscientiously study this document of Comrade Stalin, and resolutely implement the great call of Chairman Mao to our youth: "Good health, good study, and good work."

    学习斯大林“在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上的演说”
    叶林
    斯大林同志关于青年运动的英明指示，对中国青年来讲，是非常亲切的。远在一九二六年，他就在“论中国革命底前途”一文中，对中国的青年运动作了深刻的分析与指示。他说：“没有谁像中国青年这样深刻和活生生地体验到帝国主义的压迫，没有谁像中国青年这样尖锐和沉痛地感到必须与这种压迫作斗争。”因此，他认为中国的“学生青年（革命学生）、工人青年、农民青年——所有这些都可以大大推进革命的力量”。中国的青年遵循了他所指示的道路，在中国共产党的直接领导下，正如他所说的那样，成为中国革命斗争中“一个重要的方面军”。他们站在中国革命斗争的前列，前仆后继，英勇地贡献了自己的一切，从而帮助党取得了中国革命的伟大胜利。毛主席这次在接见中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会主席团的时候，也对他们的事业作了正确的估价。他说：工农青年、知识青年和部队中的青年，他们英勇积极，很有纪律，没有他们，革命事业和建设事业就不能胜利。
    现在，我国已经完成了社会改革，而进入了一个伟大的新的历史时期，即国家已由国民经济的恢复时期开始进入国民经济有计划的建设时期。我国的全体青年团员和青年们，和全国人民一起，要像中国共产党中央委员会代表刘少奇同志在青年团第二次全国代表大会上所指示的那样，担负起“逐步地实现国家的工业化并在这个基础上使我们祖国由新民主主义逐步地过渡到社会主义”的新的历史任务，团结在党的周围，“站到为国家工业化而斗争的最前列”。
    斯大林“在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上的演说”这一重要的文献，虽然并不是对中国青年直接的教导，但它的极其深刻的思想，同样会给我们重大的启示，帮助我们将青年运动推向新的历史时期。
    在这一文献里，斯大林同志谈了三个问题。
    第一个问题是加强工人阶级底战斗准备。这一个问题的提出，是苏联在和平发展底条件下建设了五年，既没有与国外敌人作战，国内也没有内战因素的时候，也就是在苏联开始实行第一个五年计划的那一年。斯大林同志通过这一个问题，对当时革命胜利后充满“一切都将是一帆风顺”的情绪，发出了警号。他认为由于过分相信自己的力量和过于轻视敌人的力量而滋长起来的太平观念、打瞌睡的麻痹思想，就会使敌人有机可乘而起来反对我们（如发生沙赫亭事件），就会大大地损害了我们的经济建设事业。今天，我们祖国的大规模建设是在抗美援朝的条件下进行的，暗藏的敌人也无时无刻不在阴谋破坏我们的建设事业，我们是应该牢牢地记取这一教导的。刘少奇同志与朱总司令在这次青年团第二次全国代表大会上，在这一方面也对我们全国青年团员与青年作了重要的指示。刘少奇同志说：“把保卫祖国、建设祖国的伟大事业与保卫世界和平的伟大事业紧密地联系起来，学习苏联列宁共产主义青年团的光辉榜样，继续与和平、民主、社会主义阵营各国的青年以及世界其他国家的先进青年团结一心，为保卫世界和平、争取人类美好的将来而奋勇前进！”朱总司令说：“希望青年们把自己锻炼成为祖国的积极的自觉的保卫者和建设者”。这是当前我们青年团员与青年们一个重要的任务。斯大林同志说：“只要我们国家里还存在着阶级，只要我们还有资本主义国家的包围，就应该使这个任务贯串着我们的整个工作。”也必须这样，我们才能“巩固工人阶级的力量、它的警惕性、它的革命性、它的战斗准备，来反对这些敌人”。这就是加强工人阶级战斗准备的意义所在。
    第二个问题是组织自下而上的群众性批评。这一个问题的提出，也是与苏联的经济建设密切相关的。斯大林同志认为假使不把国家建设道路上的官僚主义铲除，那末一切革命组织将会被敌人腐蚀，而发生“道德败坏和沦丧的可耻事实”，也就不能“唤醒群众，揭露我们的缺点，指出改善我们建设的途径”。而这“除了组织党的自下而上的群众性监督以外，除了培植党内民主以外，是没有而且也不能有任何其他的办法来反对这个毒害的”。斯大林同志这样尖锐地提出这个问题，曾有力地把社会主义建设事业推向前进。为了我们祖国的建设，毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上，对开展批评与自我批评、反对官僚主义的问题，也英明地作了指示；并且这个斗争在全国范围内普遍地开展起来，获得巨大的成绩。这次反对官僚主义的斗争，对教育青年具有原则精神，培养他们坚决与危害党与人民利益的现象作斗争的高贵品质，无疑是有重大意义的。刘少奇同志在这次青年团第二次全国代表大会上为此特地作了明确的指示。他说：“青年团员要学会运用批评和自我批评的方法去和一切损害人民事业与党的事业的不良现象进行斗争。”根据党的指示，团章第一章第二条第六项规定：“遵守国家法令，爱护公共财产，与危害人民利益的行为作斗争。”为此，我们青年应当成为遵守国家法令、爱护公共财产、维护革命秩序的模范。应当勇于改正自己的错误；应当积极而诚恳地对于任何同志和领导机关的缺点和错误提出批评；应当敢于和一切危害人民利益的行为进行不调和的斗争。
    第三个问题是青年应当掌握科学。这个问题是为了适应当时苏联面临着改造整个国民经济的伟大任务必须培养新的建设人材而提出的。斯大林同志说：“要建设，就必须有知识，就必须掌握科学。而要有知识，就必须学习。顽强地、耐心地学习。”“我们面前有一个堡垒。这个堡垒叫作科学，它有许多许多的知识部门。这个堡垒我们不管怎样要把它拿下来。”“掌握科学，锻炼出一切知识部门的布尔什维克专家，学习、学习、最顽强地学习，——这便是现在的任务。”我们青年如能很好地完成这个任务，那末我们就能成为新生活的建设者，成为老近卫军底真正替换者。斯大林同志对青年这样宝贵的教诲，在我国青年团一届三中全会关于学习问题的决定中很好地被贯彻了，并受到了全国各地团的组织、全体团员和广大青年们的热烈拥护。在这次青年团第二次全国代表大会上，刘少奇同志对学习问题指示说：“作为党的助手和后备军，中国新民主主义青年团的全体团员就要努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的共产主义的觉悟程度。青年团员要努力学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的学说，学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习各种科学知识特别是苏联的先进科学和技术的知识，学习党和国家各种政策的知识，学习各种生产业务和各种工作业务的知识。青年团员要永远记住列宁的教导：学习、学习、再学习。这就是青年团员的重大任务。”朱总司令在大会上指示我们说：“青年团员就不仅要具有高度的政治觉悟和共产主义道德品质，而且应该成为具有专门知识和技术的人。我们的青年必须有充分的文化，必须积极掌握科学技术，这是建设和保卫我们的祖国所绝对必需的。”这些指示是非常重要的，党已把光荣的学习任务放在我们年轻人的身上了。但是，我们要知道，政治学习与业务学习乃是一个统一体，只有真正具有共产主义的人生观和道德观，才能够在专门知识和专门业务的学习上获得进步；而只有掌握专门知识和专门业务，才能够在为实现共产主义事业的斗争中作出真正的贡献。同时，我们还必须认识，学习与工作是紧密结合着的。经验证明，“做什么，学什么”“边做边学、逐步提高”的原则是正确的，我们必须善于运用这些经验，很好地完成党所交给我们的学习任务。
    让我们根据党的指示及青年团第二次全国代表大会的决议，认真学习斯大林同志这一篇文献，坚决执行毛主席向我们青年们提出的“身体好，学习好，工作好”的伟大号召。
