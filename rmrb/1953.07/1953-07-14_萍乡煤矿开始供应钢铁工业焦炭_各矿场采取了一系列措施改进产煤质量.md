Xinhua News Agency: The famous coking coal producing area, the Pingxiang Coal Mine, has begun supplying coke to China's steel industry. Trains loaded with the first few batches of coke have recently departed from the Pingxiang mining area.

	Pingxiang coal mines have low sulfur content and strong adhesion, making it excellent coking coal. To meet the large-scale needs of the iron and steel smelting industry, Pingxiang Coal Mine has, since this year, made fully supplying coking coal the general principle of the mine's production and capital construction, and has begun testing coke production. This year, employees of the Pingxiang Coal Mine received letters from employees of some steel mills, asking them to produce good coke to supply the steel mills to produce better steel for the country. This situation greatly encouraged the employees of the Pingxiang Coal Mine. Thanks to the creative work of the coking workers and the enthusiastic cooperation of the coal mining and washing workers, the first furnace of coke was successfully trial-produced before the "May Day" holiday, and coke began to be supplied to the steel industry in June of this year. Now, the coke production work of Pingxiang Coal Mine has begun to proceed regularly according to plan, and the amount of coke shipped from Pingxiang Coal Mine to steel mills will increase day by day in the future.

	During the Hanyeping Company era, the coking coal produced by the Pingxiang Coal Mine was entirely made into coke to serve the steel industry. However, this situation only accounted for a very short period in the history of Pingxiang Coal Mine. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang bandits caused the iron and steel industry in the Hanyang area to decline sharply. With no market for coke, the coal produced by the Pingxiang Coal Mine was used as ordinary industrial fuel for a long time, and even as cooking fuel, seriously wasting the country's valuable resources. Now, with the start of large-scale economic construction in our country, the steel industry needs a large amount of coke, which has enabled the high-quality coal of Pingxiang Coal Mine to play its due role.

Xinhua News Agency: Through a series of efforts by the leadership and the masses of workers, the quality of coal produced by the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine has improved, among which the improvement of the Longhu Mine and Wangjiayuan Mine No. 1 well is particularly significant. For example, comparing the first half of this year with the whole of last year: the average ash content of raw coal in the Longhu Mine decreased by 3.22 percent, and the average ash content of clean coal decreased by 0.96 percent; the average ash content of raw coal in Wangjiayuan Mine No. 1 well decreased by 1.78 percent, and the average ash content of clean coal decreased by 0.77 percent.

	Since the end of last year, the leaders of Pingxiang Coal Mine have taken a series of measures to improve coal quality. First, they used newspapers, radio stations and other propaganda tools to calculate in detail the serious losses caused to the country due to poor coal quality, and conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda and education for all employees, and promptly formulated reward measures to improve coal quality. Then, on this basis, a mass stone-picking movement was launched. Coal miners, coal loaders, car loaders, coal hopper unloaders, and cart pushers all actively participated in this movement. According to statistics, more than 3,000 workers have been rewarded in the first half of this year for their achievements in improving coal quality through picking stones or learning advanced experience.

	The coal and rocks in many coal seams in the Pingxiang Coal Mine are interlaced with each other. The leaders of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau used the method of offering rewards for research topics to call on everyone to create experience in separate mining and transportation of coal and rock; and regarded the experience of separate mining and transportation of coal and rock created by employees as one of the most important advanced experiences in the entire mine and promoted it universally. Because the Longhu Mine and Wangjiayuan Mine No. 1 well partially implemented separate mining and transportation of coal and rock, more than 50,000 tons of clean coal that did not need to be screened or washed were mined in the first half of this year. The ash content of this unscreened and unwashed coal is even lower than that of ordinary clean coal, which saves the country a lot of washing and transportation costs, and also plays a good role in reducing costs.

	At present, the work of improving coal quality in Pingxiang Coal Mine is continuing actively. The scale of the stone-picking movement and the scope of promotion of the experience of separate mining and transportation of coal and rock are being further expanded. The Longhu Mine plans to strive to fully implement the method of separate mining and transportation of coal and rock in all mining faces in the second half of this year in order to further improve the quality of coal.

    萍乡煤矿开始供应钢铁工业焦炭
    各矿场采取了一系列措施改进产煤质量
    【新华社讯】著名的炼焦煤产地——萍乡煤矿区已开始对我国钢铁工业供应焦炭。装载着最初几炉焦炭的列车最近已经从萍乡矿区里驶出。
    萍乡矿区的藏煤含硫率低，粘结性强，是很好的炼焦煤。为了供应钢铁冶炼工业的大量需要，萍乡煤矿从今年起就已经把充分供应炼焦煤作为全矿生产和基本建设的总方针，并着手作炼制焦炭的试验。今年，萍乡煤矿的职工们收到一些钢铁厂职工的来信，要求他们能炼出好焦炭，来供应钢铁厂为国家炼出更好的钢铁。这种情况大大鼓舞了萍乡煤矿的职工。由于炼焦工人们的创造性的劳动和采煤、洗选等工人的热情配合，第一炉焦炭在“五一”节前夕就试炼成功，并于今年六月开始向钢铁工业供应焦炭。现在，萍乡煤矿的炼焦工作已经开始正规地按计划进行，今后萍乡煤矿运往钢铁厂的焦炭将一天一天地增加。
    在汉冶萍公司时代，萍乡煤矿所产的炼焦煤是全部炼成焦炭为钢铁工业服务的。但是这种情况在萍乡煤矿的历史上只占一个很短的时期。国民党匪帮的反动统治，使汉阳地区的钢铁工业一蹶不振，焦炭没有销路，萍乡煤矿所产的煤就长期地被用作普通工业燃料，甚至当作做饭的燃料使用，严重地浪费了国家可贵的资源。现在，我国大规模经济建设开始，钢铁工业需要大量的焦炭，这使萍乡煤矿的优质煤开始起着它应有的作用。
    【新华社讯】国营萍乡煤矿经过领导方面和工人群众一系列的努力，产煤质量已有改善，其中龙虎矿场和王家源矿场一号井改善的情况尤为显著。如以今年上半年和去年全年比较：龙虎矿场原煤灰份平均降低了百分之三点二二，净煤灰份平均降低了百分之零点九六，王家源矿场一号井原煤灰份平均降低了百分之一点七八，净煤灰份平均降低了百分之零点七七。
    从去年年底以来，萍乡煤矿领导方面就采取一系列的措施来改善煤质。他们首先运用报纸、广播电台等各种宣传工具，用算细账的方法算出因煤质低劣而使国家遭受严重损失的情况，对全体职工进行了广泛深入的宣传教育，并及时制订出改善煤质的奖励办法。接着，就在此基础上开展了一个群众性的检石头运动。采煤、上煤、装车、下煤斗、推车等各工种工人都积极参加了这个运动。据统计，因检石头或学习先进经验改善煤质有成绩而受到奖励的工人，今年上半年就有三千多人。
    萍乡煤矿的许多煤层的煤和岩石是互相交错生成的。萍乡矿务局的领导方面用课题悬赏的办法，号召大家创造煤石分采分运的经验；并且把职工创造的煤石分采分运经验作为全矿最重要的先进经验之一，加以普遍推广。龙虎矿场和王家源矿场一号井由于部分实行了煤石分采分运，今年上半年采出原煤中，不筛不洗的净煤就有五万多吨。这种不筛不洗煤所含的灰份比一般净煤的灰份还低，给国家节省了不少洗选费和运费，对降低成本也起了很好的作用。
    目前，萍乡煤矿改善煤质的工作正在继续积极进行。检石运动的规模和煤石分采分运经验的推行范围还在进一步扩大中。龙虎矿场今年下半年计划争取在各个采煤工作面全部实行煤石分采分运的办法，以求进一步改善煤的质量。
