Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd - At the morning session of the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League on July 2nd, Comrade Hu Yaobang gave a summary of the discussion on the work report of the Central Committee of the League. He said that everyone enthusiastically discussed and unanimously supported the instructions given to our congress by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, representing the Party Central Committee, and everyone agreed with the work report submitted by the Central Committee of the League, so I will not say more.

Now, what I want to talk about is: Chairman Mao received the Presidium of the Congress the day before yesterday and gave us extremely important instructions. These instructions are a summary of the discussions at our congress.

Chairman Mao said: Under the leadership of the Party, the Youth League has mobilized millions of Youth League members and united the youth of the whole country to cooperate with the central work of the Party, and has achieved great results. He said that the working-class and peasant youth, intellectual youth, and youth in the army are heroic, active, and very disciplined. Without them, the revolutionary cause and the construction cause cannot be victorious.

Chairman Mao said: Now that social reform has been completed, a new period of construction has begun. In addition to continuing to cooperate with the central work of the Party, the Youth League should also have independent work suitable for the characteristics of youth. New China should think about the youth and care about the growth of the younger generation. Young people should study and work, but the youth period is a period of physical development. Therefore, we must fully take into account the two aspects of youth's work, study, entertainment, sports, and rest.

Chairman Mao was filled with deep love and care for our younger generation of youth, and he asked us to convey his congratulations to the youth and all members of the Youth League throughout the country. He congratulated everyone on being healthy, studying well, and working well.

Hu Yaobang then said, we, the youth and all members of the League throughout the country, sincerely thank Chairman Mao for his concern. We must achieve three goods. This is the direction of the Youth League's work in the future.

Hu Yaobang said that we thank the youth friends from various countries who have come to our congress to offer their congratulations. Our friendship with each other will be further consolidated and developed. We must earnestly absorb the experience of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League to improve our work. Let us unite more closely to welcome our better future.

After Hu Yaobang's summary report, all the delegates immediately adopted the "Election Method of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League" and the list of supervisors, and then elected the members and alternate members of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League.

    在接见青年团代表大会主席团时
    毛主席指示团的工作方向
    胡耀邦同志在青年团全国代表大会二日会议上作了传达
    【新华社二日讯】在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会二日上午的会议上，胡耀邦同志作了关于团中央工作报告讨论的总结。他说，大家热烈地讨论了并一致拥护党中央代表刘少奇同志对我们大会的指示，大家都同意团中央所提出的工作报告，我就不再多讲了。
    现在，我要讲的是：毛主席在前天接见了大会主席团，对我们作了极其重要的指示。这个指示，就是对我们大会讨论的总结。
    毛主席说：青年团在党的领导下，动员了几百万青年团员并团结了全国青年，配合了党的中心工作，成绩很大。他说，工农青年、知识青年和部队中的青年，他们英勇积极，很有纪律，没有他们，革命事业和建设事业就不能胜利。
    毛主席说：现在社会改革已经完成，新的建设时期开始了。青年团除了应继续配合党的中心工作以外，还要有适合青年特点的独立工作。新中国要为青年们着想，要关怀青年一代的成长。青年们要学习，要工作，但青年时期是长身体的时期。因此，要充分兼顾青年的工作、学习和娱乐、体育、休息两个方面。
    毛主席充满了对我们青年一代深切爱护的心情，要我们传达他对全国青年和全体青年团员的祝贺。他祝贺大家身体好，学习好，工作好。
    胡耀邦接着说，我们全国青年和全体团员衷心地感谢毛主席对我们的关怀。我们一定要做到三个好。这就是青年团今后工作的方向。
    胡耀邦说，我们感谢光临我们大会的各国青年朋友的祝贺，我们互相间的友谊将进一步地巩固和发展起来。我们要认真地吸收苏联列宁共产主义青年团的经验，以改进我们的工作。让我们更紧密地团结在一起，迎接我们更美好的将来。
    胡耀邦总结报告后，大会全体代表随即通过“中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会选举办法”和监选人名单，接着选举出中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会的委员和候补委员。
