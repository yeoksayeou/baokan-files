Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative

Corrects the Deviation of Blindly Putting Livestock Under Public Ownership

Last autumn, the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Aiguo Village (formerly Lüjia Village), Ju County, Shandong Province, reluctantly concentrated sixteen donkeys, along with other livestock, turning them into the "public" property of the cooperative. Soon after, problems arose. When members wanted to use the donkeys to grind flour, everyone chose the best ones. Later, although the donkeys were separated for fixed use, disputes still frequently occurred. The fodder for all twenty-three livestock (including cattle and horses) in the cooperative had to be collected temporarily from the members every day, and often it was impossible to collect enough. Due to the lack of feed and the excessive burden, all the donkeys, except for six well-fed cattle, had protruding ribs and raised rumps.

After the spring plowing and sowing this year, cadres from the Aiguo Village work team and the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative's Cooperative Affairs Committee held a meeting to review their errors of rash advance, setting up large stalls, and engaging in unrealistic planning. After full deliberation and discussion by the members, they re-stipulated that, apart from the six cattle being collectively raised, all donkeys would be valued and returned to their original households for feeding; when the cooperative needed to use donkeys, it would provide reasonable remuneration to the households owning the donkeys.

Now, it has been more than a month since the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative returned the livestock to their original households for feeding, and the results are very good. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    吕鸿宾农业生产合作社
    纠正盲目把牲畜归公的偏向
    去年秋季，山东省莒县爱国村（原吕家庄）吕鸿宾农业生产合作社，勉强把十六头驴子连同其他牲畜集中起来，成了社的“公共”财产。接着，问题就发生了。当社员要使驴子给自己推磨时，谁都拣好的使。后来虽然把驴子分开固定使用，但仍经常发生争执。全社二十三头牲口（包括牛和马）的饲料，每天都要向社员临时凑集，还往往无法凑齐。由于草料缺乏，负担过重，全社除六头牛养的较好外，所有驴子个个都肋骨突出，腚尖隆起。
    今年春耕播种结束后，爱国村工作组干部和吕鸿宾农业生产合作社社务委员会开会检讨了急躁冒进、摆大摊、打大谱的错误思想。经过社员充分酝酿讨论后，重新规定除六头牛伙养外，驴子全部作价退回原户饲养；社内要用驴子时，须给有驴户合理报酬。
    现在，吕鸿宾农业生产合作社牲畜退回原户饲养已经一个多月，效果很好。（据新华社讯）
