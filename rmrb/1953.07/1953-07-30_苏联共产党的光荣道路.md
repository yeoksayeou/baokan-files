    The Glorious Road of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    Today is the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a day of great significance in the history of the entire international revolutionary movement.
    At the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party held on this day fifty years ago, the foundation was laid for the first fighting, revolutionary Marxist party of the working class in world history, a new type of party that was fundamentally different from the reformist parties of the Second International.
    Founded by Lenin, the great successor to the doctrines of Marx and Engels, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has, over the past half-century, guided the Soviet people and the awakened working masses of all countries in fundamentally changing the face of the world.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the people of Russia in two bourgeois democratic revolutions in 1905 and February 1917, and the October Socialist Revolution in 1917, establishing a proletarian dictatorship in one-sixth of the world's landmass, thus opening up a new era of the demise of world capitalism and the victory of socialist revolution, and realizing a fundamental transformation of human history.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution awakened hundreds of millions of working people in all countries of the world, attracting them to the struggle for a new life. Advanced elements of the working class in various countries, with the help of the Communist International initiated by Lenin, formed and developed their own revolutionary headquarters of the working class—the Communist Party—according to the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Chinese Communist Party, the leader and organizer of the Chinese People's Revolution, was founded in this way. After the October Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary movement in Western capitalist countries and the national liberation movement in oppressed countries in the East—especially in China—not only experienced new upsurges, but also merged into a unified proletarian socialist revolutionary front against imperialism.
    Under the leadership of Lenin and the inheritor of Lenin's cause, the great Stalin and his comrades-in-arms, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people built the first socialist country in the world, and are continuing to advance on the road of gradually transitioning from a socialist society to a communist society. The people of all countries under the dark and reactionary rule of capitalism saw their bright future in the Soviet Union, and gained revolutionary confidence and strength from the Soviet Union.
    During World War II, the Soviet people led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the heroic and invincible Soviet army eliminated the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist aggressors, and liberated the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement. The people of China and many other countries were freed from the shackles of capitalism and established people's democratic systems. The victorious China, the people's democratic countries, and the Soviet Union together formed a united and powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp of over 800 million people, standing in opposition to the increasingly weakened reactionary capitalist camp. The world situation has fundamentally changed.
    Having undergone fifty years of glorious training, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is now leading the Soviet people in carrying out the great cause of communist construction, and is inspiring progressive mankind all over the world to fight for world peace, for people's democracy, and for the cause of socialism.
    The experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proves that the demise of capitalist imperialism is irreversible, while the victory of workers, peasants, and colonial peoples of all countries, and the victory of the socialist cause, are irresistible. The overthrow of the landlord-bourgeois rule in Russia, the failure of the intervention of fourteen countries against the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, and the annihilation of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist aggressors in World War II all prove this historical truth. The imperialist reactionaries, because they have no confidence in peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union and the peaceful democratic camp, try every means to undermine the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and carry out various kinds of terror against their own people and the colonial people in order to save their crisis. But the history of the past fifty years shows that this vicious attempt will absolutely not achieve its goal.
    The experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proves that workers and peasants can win and must win, but to achieve revolutionary victory, and to consolidate and develop this victory after the revolution, and to build a socialist and communist society, it is necessary to have a fighting, revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist party as its leading force. This party should be composed of the most outstanding, most conscious, and most experienced elements of the working class, armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and tactics, with unified organization and strict discipline, using the method of criticism and self-criticism, maintaining close ties with the masses of the people, and serving the people with absolute loyalty. Only under the leadership of such a party can the working class and the oppressed and exploited people of all countries find the correct path of struggle, unite themselves, and unify their strength and actions in order to achieve victory.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an example of such a party. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been continuously strengthened because it faithfully abides by the various principles of Lenin's doctrine on the party, because it relies on democratic centralism, on collective leadership, on unified organization and discipline, on criticism and self-criticism, and on constantly cleansing its ranks of opportunists, degenerates, and traitors. The death of the great Lenin and Stalin did not shake and weaken the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as the reactionaries had imagined, because the foundation of Lenin and Stalin's cause is not the individual, but the collective of the party connected with the broad masses; the reason why Leninism is invincible lies precisely in this.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People warmly celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union because its interests are closely linked and completely consistent with the interests of the Chinese working class and the Chinese People. The telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stated: "The Communist Party of China was established and developed by taking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an example. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the development of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the encouragement and assistance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet People. The Communist Party of China deeply understands the great significance of the complete unity of the people of the Soviet Union and China for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism in the Soviet Union, China, and the world, and firmly believes that the great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China will be increasingly consolidated." These words in the telegram accurately express the thoughts and feelings of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. The people of the Soviet Union and China are becoming more and more closely united in order to build a happy life, to strive for world peace and progress, and to oppose the sabotage of the imperialist reactionary forces. The 50 years of glorious experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union not only illuminate the path of advancement for the Soviet People, but also illuminate the path of advancement for the Chinese People and the people of other countries. To deeply study the historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and correctly apply it in the current struggle is the best way for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Soviet Communist Party.

    苏联共产党的光荣道路
    今天是苏联共产党五十周年纪念日，这是整个国际革命运动历史上的一个意义重大的日子。
    在五十年前的今天举行的俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会上，奠定了世界历史上第一个工人阶级的战斗的、革命的马克思主义的政党，即与第二国际各改良政党有原则区别的新型政党的基础。
    由马克思和恩格斯学说的继承者、伟大的列宁所创立的苏联共产党，在过去的半世纪之内，引导苏联人民和各国的觉悟的劳动群众，根本改变了世界的面貌。
    苏联共产党领导俄国的人民进行了一九○五年和一九一七年二月两次资产阶级民主革命和一九一七年十月社会主义革命，在全世界六分之一的土地上建立了无产阶级专政的国家，因而开辟了世界资本主义死亡和社会主义革命胜利的新纪元，实现了人类历史的根本转变。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，唤醒了世界各国的亿万劳动群众，吸引了他们走向争取新生活的斗争。各国工人阶级的先进分子在列宁所发起的共产国际的帮助之下，按照苏联共产党的榜样，组成了和发展了自己的工人阶级的革命司令部——共产党。中国人民革命的领导者和组织者中国共产党，就是这样成立起来的。在十月革命之后，西方资本主义国家的无产阶级革命运动和东方被压迫国家——首先是中国——的民族解放运动，不但都有了新的高涨，而且汇合成为一条统一的反帝国主义的无产阶级社会主义革命战线了。
    苏联共产党和苏联人民在列宁和列宁事业的继承者伟大的斯大林及其战友们的领导下，建成了世界上第一个社会主义国家，并正在由社会主义社会逐渐过渡到共产主义社会的道路上继续前进。在资本主义黑暗反动统治下的各国人民，从苏联看到了自己的光明的未来，从苏联获得了革命的信心和力量。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联共产党所领导的苏联人民和英勇无敌的苏军，消灭了德、意、日法西斯侵略者，从法西斯奴役的威胁下解救了欧亚两洲的人民。中国和其他许多国家的人民，摆脱了资本主义的枷锁，建立了人民民主制度。胜利了的中国、各人民民主国家和苏联在一起，组成了八万万人以上的、团结一致的、强大的和平民主社会主义阵营，而与日趋削弱的反动的资本主义阵营相对立。世界局势根本转变了。
    经历了五十年光荣锻炼的苏联共产党，现在正在领导苏联人民进行伟大的共产主义建设，并鼓舞着全世界的进步人类为世界和平、为人民民主和社会主义事业而斗争。
    苏联共产党的经验证明：资本主义帝国主义的死亡是不可挽救的，而各国工人农民和殖民地人民的胜利，社会主义事业的胜利，则是不可抗拒的。俄国的地主资产阶级统治的被推翻，十月革命以后十四个国家干涉苏联的失败，第二次大战中德、意、日法西斯侵略力量的被消灭，都证明了这个历史的真理。帝国主义反动派因为没有信心与苏联和和平民主阵营和平共处，千方百计地想要破坏苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家，并且对本国人民和殖民地人民施行各种恐怖，借以挽救自己的危机。但是过去五十年的历史表明这个恶毒的企图绝对达不到目的。
    苏联共产党的经验证明工人农民能够胜利并且必然胜利，但是要取得革命的胜利，在革命胜利之后要巩固和发展这个胜利，要建成社会主义和共产主义社会，就必须要有一个战斗的、革命的、马克思列宁主义的党作为自己的领导力量。这个党应当是由工人阶级的最优秀、最有觉悟、最有经验的分子组成的，用马克思列宁主义的理论和策略武装起来的，有统一的组织和严格的纪律的，使用批评和自我批评的方法的，与人民群众保持密切联系，绝对忠诚地为人民服务的。工人阶级和各国被压迫被剥削人民只有在这样的党的领导下，才能找到正确的斗争道路，并团结自己和统一自己的力量和行动，以便取得胜利。
    苏联共产党就是这样的党的榜样。苏联共产党由于忠实遵守列宁关于党的学说的各种原则，由于依靠民主集中制，依靠集体的领导，依靠统一的组织和纪律，依靠批评和自我批评，依靠不断地清洗自己队伍中的机会主义分子、蜕化分子和叛徒，而得到不断的加强。伟大的列宁和斯大林的逝世没有像反动分子所设想的动摇和削弱苏联共产党，因为列宁斯大林事业的基础不是个人，而是联系着广大群众的党的集体；列宁主义之所以不可战胜，其原因正在于此。
    中国共产党和中国人民热烈地庆祝苏联共产党的五十周年，因为苏联共产党的利益和中国工人阶级、中国人民的利益是密切联系着的，是完全一致的。中国共产党中央委员会给苏联共产党中央委员会的电文说：“中国共产党是以苏联共产党为榜样而成立和发展起来的。中国人民革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的发展，同苏联共产党、苏联政府、苏联人民的鼓舞和援助是分不开的。中国共产党深刻了解苏中两国人民的完全团结一致对于苏中两国和世界和平民主社会主义事业的重要意义，并且深信苏中两国人民之间的伟大友谊将日益巩固。”电文里的这段话准确地表达了几万万中国人民的思想和情感。苏中两国人民为了建设幸福的生活，为了争取世界的和平和进步，为了反对帝国主义反动势力的破坏，正在愈来愈亲密地结合在一起。苏联共产党的五十年的光荣经验不但照耀着苏联人民的前进道路，也照耀着中国人民和其他各国人民的前进道路。深刻地学习苏联共产党的历史经验，在当前的斗争中，正确地加以应用，这就是中国共产党和中国人民庆祝苏联共产党五十周年的最好的方法。
