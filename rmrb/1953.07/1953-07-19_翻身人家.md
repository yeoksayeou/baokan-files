	People Who Have Overturned Their Lives
	Mu Guangtian
	The sun had just begun to peek out redly when the train stopped at a small station in a valley. This was our destination – ×× County, Jilin Province.
	According to the assigned area, we walked towards the village south of the station. A little girl greeted us with a grin, as if she had known us in the past, saying without any restraint, "Comrades, stay at our house, my grandpa told me to pick you up." She happily skipped and hopped, leading us to her home. The family also acted as if they were welcoming long-separated relatives, wiping tables and sweeping the floor, busily cleaning up the house for us. I put down my backpack and looked outside. Ha! In the square courtyard, there were four large oxen, two gray horses, and two plump pigs swaying back and forth, as well as cats, dogs, chickens, and ducks, everything complete, looking like a small zoo. Plus, those two round and tall stacks of soybeans in the southeast corner – it was obviously a newly emancipated, prosperous farmer's home.
	In the evening, I returned from outside and happened to catch them holding a family meeting. In order not to disturb them, I quietly stood aside and listened. The whole family consisted of nine people: the elderly grandfather, three sons, three daughters-in-law, and two granddaughters. The eldest daughter-in-law, who was speaking, suddenly lowered her voice when she saw me come in, looking a little embarrassed. She was criticizing herself for making dinner late, which delayed going up the mountain. The third daughter-in-law then offered a suggestion to the grandfather, because he had crippled the duck's leg. Finally, the grandfather admitted his mistake, saying, "You're right, since the seedlings have already been eaten, we should drive the ducks out properly." Before long, the meeting ended happily.
	That night, it started raining heavily. I was in the middle of a dream when I suddenly heard the grandfather shout, "Xiao Hua's father, get up and go to the West River Cliff!..." I was a little puzzled. It was so dark and raining so hard. What did the grandfather want his son to go to the river cliff for? Then I heard again, "The mountain torrents have come down! Check if the wooden bridge has been washed away. If it’s bad, report to the district quickly." Just then, the neighborhood group leader ran over to inform everyone that each family should send one person to rush to repair the wooden bridge. As soon as the grandfather's three sons heard this, they all got up. All three of them were vying to go, but the grandfather said, "Don't make a fuss, the comrades are sleeping. If you're going, then all of you go!"
	It wasn't until dawn that the three sons returned, each soaked by the rain like a drowned chicken. As soon as they met, the grandfather anxiously asked, "How's the bridge? Is it washed away?" "No, it's not." The eldest son replied while taking off his clothes. At this moment, I said with emotion, "Grandfather, you are truly a person who has overturned your life, your awareness is high, and you are so enthusiastic about everyone's affairs." After hearing this, he smiled, put his black pipe on the kang, and started talking to me warmly, saying, "This area, from Dong Village to Xi Village, only has this one bridge. If it's washed away, it will be inconvenient to travel and will also affect production. But to tell you the truth, in the old society, we poor people had empty stomachs almost all the time, and couldn't even take care of our own bellies. Who would have the mind to care about any bridges? Speaking of which, I'm not afraid of the comrades laughing at me, but one winter, when the snow was sealing the doors, my family was so hungry that we had no choice. I secretly smashed a fat dog of a landlord to death, skinned it, and the whole family ate it for two days." Speaking to this point, he sighed with great emotion, and then said, "Since the Communist Party came, we have finally ended the poor days. The year before last, we struggled against the landlord Wu Dazui in the east of the village, and my family was divided into one field of land and two cows. Now there is land to cultivate on the mountains, and there are cows and horses in the yard. If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us poor people to overturn our lives, let alone raising cows and horses, we wouldn't even be able to feed ourselves! The kindness of Chairman Mao is something my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will never be able to repay!" Finally, the grandfather revealed a smile and said, "People who have overturned their lives must not forget their roots. We must produce well, and we must be even more enthusiastic about public affairs, and always follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao."

    翻身人家
    慕广田
    太阳刚冒红，火车就在山谷中的一个小站停下了。这里就是我们的目的地——吉林省××县。
    我们按指定的地区，向车站南面的庄子走去。一个小姑娘笑嘻嘻地迎着我们，她好像和我们过去就认识似的，一点也不拘束地说：“同志，你们住在俺家吧，我爷爷叫我来接你们的。”她乐得一蹦一跳地把我们领到家里。一家人也好像迎接久别的亲人一样，又擦桌子又扫地，忙着给我们收拾房子。我放下背包，到外边看了一下。哈！方方的大院子里，有四条大牛，两匹青马，肥肥的两只大猪也在院子里摇来摆去，还有猫、狗、鸡、鸭，样样齐全，看起来活像个动物园，再加上东南角那两堆又圆又高的大豆垛，一看，就是一个新翻身的富裕农家。
    傍晚我从外面回来，正巧他们一家人在开家务会。为了不打扰他们，我便悄悄地站在一边听着。全家共九口人，除老大爷以外，还有三个儿子三个儿媳妇和两个小孙女。正在发言的大媳妇，看到我一进去声音忽然小了，有点不好意思的样子。她检讨今天不该把饭做晚了，耽误上山。三媳妇接着给老大爷提了个意见，因为他把鸭子的腿打跛了。最后老大爷检讨说：“提的对，反正菜苗已经给吃了，把鸭子很好地赶出来就对啦。”不多时会议就愉快的结束了。
    晚上下起大雨，我正在睡梦中，忽然听到老大爷喊了一声：“小花她爸，起来到西河崖去！……”我有点奇怪，天这样黑，雨这么大，老大爷叫儿到河崖去干什么？接着又听到“山水已经下来啦！看看木桥是不是叫水冲坏了，要不行，就赶快到区上去报告。”正在这时，居民小组长跑来通知：每家出一个人去抢修木桥。老大爷的三个儿子一听说都起来了，他三人都抢着要去，老大爷说：“不要吵嚷，同志们都在睡觉，要去就都去吧！”
    直到天明，三个儿子才回来，个个被雨淋得像水鸡一样。一见面，老大爷就担心地问道：“桥怎么样？没冲坏吧？”“没有。”大儿子一边脱衣服一边回答。这时我感动地说：“老大爷，你真是翻了身的人，觉悟高，对大伙的事这样热心。”他听了以后，笑了笑，把那枝乌烟袋向炕上一放，便亲热地向我谈开了，他说：“这一带从东村到西村就这一座桥，如果冲坏了，来往不方便，还会影响生产。可是这话得说回来，如果在旧社会里，咱穷人一天到晚，三尺肠子空着二尺半，连自个的肚子都管不过来，谁还有心思管什么桥呢？说起来不怕同志们笑话，有一年冬天，正是大雪封门的时候，饿的我一家子实在没有办法，我偷偷的把财主家的一条大肥狗砸死，剥了剥，全家吃了两天。”说到这里他非常感慨地叹了一口气，又说：“自从共产党来了以后，总算把穷日子过完了。大前年斗争村东头地主吴大嘴，咱家分了一垧地，两头牛，这会山上有地种，院子里也有牛有马，如果不是毛主席领导咱穷人翻身，别说是养牛养马，就是连人的嘴还养不住哩！毛主席的恩情我子孙三代都报不完啊！”最后老大爷露出笑容，又说：“翻了身的人家，那会也不能忘了本，咱们得好好生产，凡是公家的事就更得热心，永远随着毛主席指出的道走。”
