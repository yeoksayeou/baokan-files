Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 22nd: According to a report from the German News Agency in Berlin on July 21st: Two weeks ago, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic requested the Soviet government to supply the German Democratic Republic with food and raw materials for manufacturing consumer goods, at the scale of past supplies.

The Soviet government has accepted this request. In the third and fourth quarters of 1953, the Soviet government will lend the German Democratic Republic an additional 231 million rubles worth of food and raw materials. Throughout 1953, the Soviet Union will supply the German Democratic Republic with 1.13 billion rubles worth of goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: According to a report from the German News Agency in Berlin: The news that the Soviet Union will lend the German Democratic Republic an additional 231 million rubles worth of food and raw materials in the second half of 1953 has been warmly commented on by democratic newspapers in Berlin.

"National Daily" wrote on July 22nd: "The Soviet government keeps its word. In the second half of this year, everyone will therefore receive an additional supply of nearly three pounds of butter, two and a half pounds of meat, one pound of cooking fat, 630 centimeters of cooking oil, and various other foods." The newspaper pointed out, regarding the so-called "aid" proposed by the United States, that this was nothing more than propaganda to make the German Democratic Republic submit to the rulers of Wall Street. The newspaper said: The 1953 trade agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union stipulates the supply of 935,000 tons of grain to the German Democratic Republic, while the United States wants to pretend to be a "benefactor" by distributing 2,000 tons of grain. It naturally expects to get a good price from this "generous action." For a small piece of dry bread, our people would have to give up the achievements they have achieved through such arduous efforts.

"Daily Review" published an editorial on July 22nd entitled "Comradely Help," discussing the prosperity of the world democratic market and the strengthening of economic cooperation. The newspaper pointed out that since 1947, the volume of foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic has increased twentyfold and exceeded the pre-war figures. According to the plan, this figure will increase by another third in 1953. The German Democratic Republic imports food, raw materials, semi-finished products, and large machines that are not manufactured in the German Democratic Republic or cannot be purchased from West Germany.

    接受民主德国部长会议的请求
    苏联今年将供应民主德国十一亿卢布的货物
    柏林民主报纸热烈欢迎苏联对民主德国的额外贸易供应
    【新华社二十二日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林二十一日讯：两星期以前，德意志民主共和国部长会议请求苏联政府按过去供应的规模，供应德意志民主共和国以食物和制造消费品的原料。
    苏联政府已经接受了这一请求。在一九五三年第三和第四季度，苏联政府将贷给民主德国以价值两亿三千一百万卢布的额外的食物和原料。在整个一九五三年，苏联将供应德意志民主共和国以价值十一亿三千万卢布的货物。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：苏联在一九五三年下半年将贷给德意志民主共和国以价值两亿三千一百万卢布额外的食物和原料的消息，已引起柏林民主报纸的热烈评论。
    “国民日报”七月二十二日写道：“苏联政府说到做到。今年下半年，每一个人将因此额外获得将近三磅牛油、两磅半肉、一磅烹调用脂油、六百三十公分食用油和各种其他食物的供应。”该报就美国建议的所谓“援助”指出，这不过是为了使民主德国服从于华尔街统治者而进行的宣传。该报说：民主德国与苏联签订的一九五三年贸易协定，规定以九十三万五千吨谷物供应民主德国，而美国却想靠分发两千吨谷物来冒充“恩人”。它自然是期待从这一“慷慨行动”中得到好价钱的。为了一小片干面包，我们的人民须得放弃他们自己这样艰苦努力才得来的成就。
    “每日评论报”七月二十二日以“同志般的帮助”为题发表社论，论述世界民主市场的繁荣与经济合作的加强。该报指出，自从一九四七年以来，民主德国的对外贸易数额已增加了二十倍，并超过了战前的数字。按照计划，在一九五三年这一数字还要增加三分之一。民主德国进口食物、原料、半制成品和在民主德国不制造也不能从西德购买到的大型机器。
