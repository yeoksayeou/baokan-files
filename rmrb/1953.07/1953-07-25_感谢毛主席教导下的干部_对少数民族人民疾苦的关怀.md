    Thanks to the cadres taught by Chairman Mao for their concern for the suffering of minority peoples

    A letter from Wang Deyi, a Hui farmer in Gansu Province: Last year, our crops were poor. This year, in order to engage in sideline production, I collected some local products and medicinal materials from my own and my relatives' homes and transported them to Zhengzhou for sale. I also bought two packages of peanuts in Zhengzhou and entrusted them to the railway to be transported to Xinyang. Because of errors in the work of the railway bureau, my peanuts were lost in transit. The price of peanuts in Xinyang also dropped, and even if they were transported later, I would lose half of my capital. I was trapped in Xinyang, with no way to make a living, and afraid of not being able to return home. In this state of sorrow and difficulty, I wrote a letter to the Party newspaper.

    Not long after my letter was published in the newspaper (Note: See the letter "Two packages of peanuts shipped from Zhengzhou disappeared after ten days or so" published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 28. Because Wang Deyi requested in his previous letter that his name not be mentioned when published, lest his family worry, the signature published in the newspaper was "A Hui farmer from Gansu Province"), the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government specially sent someone to investigate my problem. That comrade made a detailed understanding of my loss and current situation, comforted me, and said that he apologized to me on behalf of the Ministry of Railways. I had difficulty living at the time, and a section chief named Zhang at Xinyang Railway Station also asked me to eat at his place, and sometimes bought steamed buns for me to eat on the way to handle the procedures. He said: "We are all one family, your difficulties are everyone's business..." All these sincere concerns made me extremely grateful and extremely ashamed. What made me grateful was that the cadres taught by Chairman Mao cared for me more than my own brothers, and took care of our minority peoples more than anything else; what made me ashamed was that such a trivial matter as I encountered would not even be asked about by the reactionary government in the old society, but the People's Government sent someone from thousands of miles away to understand, and even apologized to me on behalf of the government, how could I feel at ease!

    On July 6th, I arrived in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau found me and told me that the government, out of consideration for me, exceptionally compensated me for all my losses. They had already remitted the 750,000 yuan for my compensation to Xinyang. Fearing that I would have to spend travel expenses to go to Xinyang to get the money, many comrades in the railway bureau first pooled 350,000 to 500,000 yuan of their salaries to advance me 750,000 yuan; they also said many words of apology to me. I was so grateful that I didn't know what to say in reply.

    When I returned to the mosque in Zhengzhou where I was staying, the Imam and all the Hui people were extremely happy when they learned about the above. They said in unison: Chairman Mao is too good to us Hui people, and he has given us such great care for such a small matter.

    I wanted to write a letter to thank the people who helped me solve the problem. But there were too many people who helped me, who should I write to? This troubled me for a long time. Later, I thought: In the final analysis, all good things are due to Chairman Mao's good leadership; I should write a letter to Chairman Mao. I also thought: Writing a letter to Chairman Mao is not an ordinary thing. I know that even the literate people I know can't write well, and I can't write even worse myself. But in order to thank our wise and great leader, my "conscience" does not allow me not to write; therefore, I boldly wrote it, expressing the gratitude of me and my whole family!

    I also want to tell our Muslims about the benefits Chairman Mao has given us, so that everyone knows Chairman Mao's concern for our minority peoples.

### 感谢毛主席教导下的干部  对少数民族人民疾苦的关怀

专栏：读者来信摘要

    感谢毛主席教导下的干部
    对少数民族人民疾苦的关怀
    甘肃省回族农民王德义来信：去年我们那里庄稼收成差，今年我为了搞副业生产，就将自己的和亲友家中的一些土产、药材收起来运到郑州卖了。我又在郑州买了两包花生米托铁路运到信阳。因为路局工作有差错，我的花生米在运输过程中不见了；信阳花生米的价钱又落了，就是以后运到也要亏一半本。我被困在信阳，生活没办法，并且怕回不了家。我在这种愁苦和困难的地步中，就给党报写了信。
    报上登了我的信后（按：见五月二十八日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊“两包花生米由郑州起运，过了十来天竟不知去向”一信。因为王德义在前次来信中提出了发表时不要写明名字、以免他的家属见了耽心的要求，所以报上发表的署名是“甘肃省一个回族农民”）不几天，中央铁道部就特地派了专人来调查我的问题。那位同志对我的损失情形和当时处境做了详细了解，对我进行安慰，还说代表铁道部向我道歉。我当时生活困难，信阳车站的一位姓张的科长还叫我到他那里吃饭，有时在陪我去办理手续的路上还买馍要我吃。他说：“我们都是一家人，你的困难就是我们大家的事……。”所有许多这样真切的关怀，使我感激极了，也使我惭愧极了。使我感激的是：在毛主席教导下的干部，对我比亲兄弟还关怀，对我们少数民族人民的照顾比什么都周到；使我惭愧的是：像我遇到的这种针尖大的事，在旧社会里反动政府是连问一声都不会的，而人民政府却从千里外派专人来了解，还代表政府向我道歉，这使我心里怎么过意得去呢！
    七月六日我到了郑州。郑州铁路局找到了我，告诉我说：政府因为照顾我，破格补偿我的全部损失。他们已将补偿我的七十五万元钱汇到信阳去了。为了怕我到信阳去取钱又要化路费，路局的好多同志们就先把他们的薪金三万五万凑起来，垫给我七十五万；还向我说了许多道歉的话。我真感激得不知道用什么话来回答才好。
    当我回到我在郑州寄住的清真寺后，寺里的教长和所有回民知道了以上这些事，都高兴极了。他们齐声说：毛主席对我们回民太好了，这样一点事竟给了那么大的照顾。
    我想写信向帮助我解决问题的人道谢。但帮助我的人太多了，我究竟该给谁写信呢？这使我为难了好久。后来我想到：一切好事，归根结底，都是毛主席领导得好；我应该给毛主席写封信。我又想到：写信给毛主席可不是一件平常的事，我知道我认得的识字人写信都写不好，我自己写得更不好。但是为了感激我们英明伟大的领袖，我的“良心”不允许我不写；因此就大胆写了，表示我和全家人的感激！
    我还要将毛主席给我们的好处告诉我们穆士林们，使大家都知道毛主席对我们少数民族人民的关怀。
