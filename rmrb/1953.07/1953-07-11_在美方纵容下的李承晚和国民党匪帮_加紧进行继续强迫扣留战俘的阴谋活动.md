Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 10th: This reporter reports: Many signs indicate that Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandit gangs are intensifying their conspiracy to continue forcibly detaining prisoners of war. They are even attempting to further forcibly detain our captured personnel who insist on repatriation, while the U.S. side continues to adopt a conniving and encouraging attitude towards them.

The Pan-Asia News Agency, which has close ties with the "Free Asia" conspiracy organization jointly run by the U.S. side and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, successively published two messages with ulterior motives yesterday. One message with a Busan dateline, quoting a so-called "person who has worked among prisoners of war"—actually a Kuomintang secret agent—fabricated that most of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who insisted on repatriation did not want to return home. This message absurdly demanded another bloody "screening" of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who insisted on repatriation. This message also revealed that the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities are forcibly conducting reactionary education to slander the Chinese people among these prisoners of war who insist on repatriation.

Another message from the Pan-Asia News Agency with a Tokyo dateline revealed that after the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was signed, in the prisoner-of-war camps on Jeju Island detaining captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were not directly repatriated, Kuomintang bandit gangs' secret agents had strengthened their control over the prisoners of war with the support of the U.S. side. This control includes intensifying so-called "educational work" and strengthening so-called "autonomous organizations." These Kuomintang secret agents are also forcing prisoners of war to write blood letters demanding to go to Taiwan. They also threatened to create so-called "collective suicides" to obstruct the implementation of the agreement on the prisoner-of-war issue after the armistice.

From these two messages, it can be clearly seen that the Kuomintang bandit gangs are now not only attempting to forcibly detain the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are not directly repatriated, but also want to forcibly detain the prisoners of war who insist on repatriation. They are attempting to use this provocative action to help Syngman Rhee further undermine the Korean armistice. The U.S. authorities directly responsible for administering the prisoner-of-war camps have not only failed to stop these outrageous acts by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, but are instead conniving at, encouraging, and even assisting them in persecuting prisoners of war.

In addition, the U.S. side is continuing to connive at the Syngman Rhee gang's forcible detention of prisoners of war. On July 6th, the U.S. side again allowed the Syngman Rhee gang to abduct twenty-six captured personnel of the Korean People's Army from the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, which was entirely guarded by the U.S. military. The U.S. guards allowed the Syngman Rhee gang to abduct these prisoners of war.

However, on the same day, the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities brutally attacked the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army on Geoje Island who insisted on repatriation. The U.S. side, on the pretext that the prisoners of war were holding a "demonstration," attacked the prisoners of war in three camp areas on Geoje Island with tear gas and concussion grenades. The U.S. side did not announce the number of prisoners of war killed or injured, only saying that eleven injured prisoners of war were sent to the hospital, one of whom was seriously injured. The so-called "demonstration" by the prisoners of war was merely a pretext for the U.S. side to massacre prisoners of war. In one camp area, when the U.S. side attacked the prisoners of war with tear gas and concussion grenades, the prisoners of war were still in their thatched huts. It was the U.S. side that attacked the thatched huts with grenades, driving the prisoners of war into the open space.

Sources here pointed out that the U.S. side is so vicious and cruel to the prisoners of war who insist on repatriation, but so conniving and encouraging to the secret agents of Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandit gangs. These two diametrically opposed attitudes are enough to explain the U.S. side's intentions. The U.S. side has already connived at Syngman Rhee's forcible detention of more than 27,000 prisoners of war, and is now still conniving at Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandit gangs' continued forcible detention of prisoners of war. Clark's reply to the Korean-Chinese side on June 29, in which he did not guarantee that "release" of prisoners of war would not occur again in the future, was clearly not accidental. The U.S. side must now immediately take effective measures to stop the rampant activities of Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandit gangs' secret agents in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. The U.S. side must be fully responsible for any "release" or "escape" incidents in the prisoner-of-war camps.

### 在美方纵容下的李承晚和国民党匪帮  加紧进行继续强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动

    在美方纵容下的李承晚和国民党匪帮
    加紧进行继续强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：许多迹象显示，李承晚和国民党匪帮正在加紧进行继续强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，他们甚至企图进一步强迫扣留坚持遣返的我方被俘人员，而美方却仍然对它们采取纵容和鼓励的态度。
    和美国方面以及国民党匪帮方面所一手包办的阴谋组织“自由亚洲”有密切关系的泛亚社，在昨天接连发表了两条别有用心消息。它的一条釜山电头的消息，引用一个所谓“曾在战俘中间工作过的人”——实际上就是国民党特务——的话，捏造说，在坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员中，有大部分是不愿回家的。这个消息荒谬绝伦地要求对坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员再进行一次血腥的“甄别”。这个消息还透露，美方战俘营当局正在对这些坚持遣返的战俘强迫进行污蔑中国人民的反动教育。
    泛亚社的另一条东京电头的消息透露，在关于战俘遣返问题的协议签订以后，在济州岛拘留不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营中，国民党匪帮的特务分子在美方支持下已加强对战俘的控制。这种控制包括加紧所谓“教育工作”，和加强所谓“自治组织”。这些国民党特务分子并且正在强迫战俘写要求到台湾去的血书。他们还威胁说要制造所谓“集体自杀”，来阻挠停战以后关于战俘问题协议的实施。
    从这两条消息中可以清楚地看到，国民党匪帮现在不但企图强迫扣留不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，而且还想强迫扣留坚持遣返的战俘。他们企图用这种挑衅行动，来帮助李承晚进一步破坏朝鲜停战。直接负责管辖战俘营的美方当局，不但没有制止国民党匪帮的这种胡作非为，反而正在纵容、鼓励甚至协助他们迫害战俘。
    除此之外，美方还在继续纵容李承晚匪帮强迫扣留战俘。七月六日，美方又听任李承晚匪帮从完全由美军看守的釜山战俘营中架走二十六名朝鲜人民军被俘人员。美方警卫人员听任李承晚匪帮架走了这些战俘。
    可是，就在这一天，美方战俘营当局却对巨济岛上坚持遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员下了毒手。美方藉口战俘举行“示威游行”，用催泪弹和震荡手榴弹进攻巨济岛上三个营场的战俘。美方没有宣布被打死或打伤的战俘的数目，仅仅说被送到医院的受伤战俘有十一名，其中一名重伤。所谓战俘举行“示威游行”仅是美方虐杀战俘的藉口。在有一个营场里，当美方用催泪弹和震荡手榴弹进攻战俘的时候，战俘们还在他们住的草屋里。是美方用手榴弹攻入草屋，把战俘们赶到旷地上去的。
    此间人士指出，美方对于坚持遣返的战俘是如此穷凶极恶，但是对于李承晚和国民党匪帮的特务分子，却是如此纵容鼓励。这两种截然相反的态度，已经足够说明美方的用心所在。美方已经纵容李承晚强迫扣留了二万七千多名战俘，现在仍然纵容李承晚和国民党匪帮继续强迫扣留战俘。克拉克在他六月二十九日给朝中方面的复信中，没有保证今后不再发生“释放”战俘的事件，这显然不是偶然的。美方现在必须立即采取有效措施，制止李承晚和国民党匪帮特务分子在美方战俘营中的猖狂活动。战俘营中的任何“释放”、“逃跑”事件，美方必须完全负责。
