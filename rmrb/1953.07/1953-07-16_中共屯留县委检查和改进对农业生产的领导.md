The CCP Tunliu County Committee in Shanxi Province organized all county cadres this spring to study the "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and the "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production to Party Committees at All Levels" issued by the CCP Central Committee, as well as the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." They conducted in-depth examination in connection with their own thinking and work. First, they found serious one-sidedness and blindness in formulating production plans. They had projected to develop 200,000 mu of ramie in the county within five years; the original plan for 1953 was to develop 80,000 mu, but in the end, less than 5,000 mu were planted. This plan violated the principle that "increasing grain production is the primary task on the agricultural production front" and did not meet the current needs of the peasants. They originally planned to promote 600 waterwheels in 1953, with 80% completed in the first quarter. However, only 110 were promoted; moreover, most of the waterwheels "promoted" last year had not yet been installed. This was because the formulation of the plan completely ignored the peasants' ideological awareness, production needs, and purchasing power, which led to the coercion of district and village cadres, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and turning good things into bad things. Especially in carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, they did not fully follow the Central Committee's instruction to advance steadily according to the needs of production development and possible conditions. Some mutual aid teams that did not meet the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee were forcibly transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. The livestock, flocks, and farm tools of 60 cooperatives were all or partially priced and entered into the cooperative, totaling 1,218 million yuan. The Li Village Cooperative in the Third District even priced the sheep herder's quilts and fur coats as assets of the cooperative. This caused ideological turmoil among the members. Livestock-owning households said: "Livestock being priced is one thing, but who knows when we'll get the money back." Households without livestock reflected: "It will take three years to pay off the debt, better to withdraw from the cooperative sooner." Some cooperatives that did not meet the conditions saw members not cherishing public property. Some people reflected: "People in agricultural production cooperatives age quickly, livestock die quickly, and furniture breaks quickly." The credibility of agricultural production cooperatives declined, and the masses outside the cooperatives also became ideologically unstable, passively waiting for "cooperation" and not being very enthusiastic about production.

The county committee led all county cadres to improve leadership over rural work during spring plowing production in accordance with the Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. The livestock, flocks, and farm tools of 46 cooperatives that had been priced and entered into the cooperative were handled correctly through discussions and democratic agreement by all members, adopting methods such as leasing, private co-use, pricing and interest payment, and raising funds for purchase within the economic capacity of the cooperative, in accordance with the principle of neither harming private property nor facilitating collective management. Fourteen agricultural production cooperatives that did not meet the conditions were reorganized into mutual aid teams based on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. The work style of cadres also began to change, emphasizing going deep among the masses, implementing policies, and using typical demonstration methods to guide agricultural production. Guo Yucheng, head of the water conservancy section, worked in Lucun Village, Second District, understanding the situation at all times, absorbing the experience of the masses, and summarizing the experience of Li Baochang in the village, who produced 1,000 jin of sorghum per mu in 1950, according to the principle of taking materials locally, summarizing locally, and promoting locally. He publicized this experience among the masses through the propaganda network. As a result, the whole village made significant achievements in accumulating fertilizer and close planting. Due to the implementation of policies and the improvement of the work style of cadres, the mood of the masses changed from turbulence to stability, and their enthusiasm for production increased. The masses actively prepared production materials. More than 1,400 head of livestock were purchased throughout the county this spring; 23,450 large and small farm tools were repaired. Blacksmiths and carpenters reflected: "There was no work to do last winter, and this spring we can't finish it." The amount of fertilizer applied exceeded last year by about one-seventh. Plowing, harrowing, and leveling were all done more carefully than last year. The county's 520,000 mu of autumn fields were all sown in a timely manner. From these works, the cadres of Tunliu County more deeply understood the great significance of correcting deviations, implementing policies, and improving work style. (Chen Mingguang)

    中共屯留县委检查和改进对农业生产的领导
    山西省屯留县委今春组织全县干部学习了中共中央发布的“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”和人民日报“领导农业生产的关键所在”的社论，联系思想和工作，进行了深入的检查。首先检查出在订生产计划中存在着严重的片面性和盲目性。他们曾预计五年内在全县发展麻田二十万亩；一九五三年原计划发展到八万亩，结果只种了不足五千亩。这个计划违背了“增产粮食是农业生产战线上的首要任务”的方针，也不符合农民当前的要求。他们原计划在一九五三年推广水车六百部，第一季度完成百分之八十。结果仅推广了一百一十部；而且去年“推”出去的大部水车还没有安装起来。这是因为在订计划时完全忽视了农民的思想觉悟、生产需要和购买能力，这就促成了区村干部的强迫命令，引起了群众的不满，把好事办成了坏事。特别是在开展互助合作运动中，没有完全按照中央指示的根据生产发展的需要与可能条件稳步前进的方针，把一些根本不够中央所规定的条件的互助组，硬改为农业生产合作社。又把六十个社的牲畜、羊群、农具全部或部分作价入社，共作价十二亿一千八百余万元。三区李村社甚至把羊工的被子、皮袄也作价归社了。这就引起社员的思想动荡。有牲口户说：“牲口作价是句话，还价不知在何年。”无牲口户反映：“动弹三年也还不完债，早点出社为正经。”有些不够条件的社，社员都不爱护公物。有的人反映：“农业生产合作社的人老得快，牲口死得快，家具坏得快。”农业生产合作社的信誉降低了，社外群众思想也动荡起来，消极地等待“合作化”，生产劲头不大。
    县委领导全县干部，在春耕生产中，按照中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议的文件，改进了对农村工作的领导。四十六个社作价归社的牲口、羊群、农具，实行全体社员讨论、民主议定的办法，采取租用、私有伙用、作价付息和在社内经济能力许可的条件下集资购买的办法，按照既不损害私有又便利集体经营的原则，作了正确的处理。不够条件的十四个农业生产合作社在群众自愿的原则下，重新改组为互助组。干部作风也开始转变了，重视了深入群众、贯彻政策，用典型示范的方法指导农业生产。水利科长郭玉城到二区路村工作，随时随地了解情况，吸取群众经验，按照就地取材，就地总结，就地推广的原则，总结了该村李保昌一九五○年每亩高粱产一千斤的经验，通过宣传网在群众中进行了宣传。结果，全村在积肥、密植方面都做出了显著成绩。由于政策的贯彻和干部作风的改进，群众情绪由动荡走向稳定，生产积极性提高了。群众积极准备生产资料，全县今春购买牲口一千四百多头；修大小农具二万三千四百五十件。铁匠木匠反映：“去冬没活干，今春干不完。”施肥量超过去年约七分之一。耕、耙、耢都比去年做得更细致了。全县五十二万亩秋田都做到了适时下种。从这些工作中，屯留县的干部们更深刻地体会到纠正偏向、贯彻政策、改进作风的重大意义。（陈明光）
