Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 8th (TASS dispatch): The German News Agency reported that on July 3rd, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement saying that the campaign being conducted by the Bonn government is one of terror and provocation.

The statement pointed out that for a long time, the Bonn government has been trying to ensure that the future Federal Parliament also adopts a pro-American stance. Therefore, it formulated an election law that is completely incompatible with the principles of free and democratic elections. Apparently, on the instructions of the Bonn government, local authorities have in recent days banned the German Communist Party from holding election rallies throughout West Germany.

Authorities in West Germany are increasingly preventing the German Communist Party from using public buildings to hold election rallies and are coercing owners of private halls not to rent their buildings for Communist Party meetings.

Incidents of fascist groups disrupting Communist Party election rallies are becoming more and more frequent. In the event of such incidents, the police always protect the fascist provocateurs.

The Bonn government, without any legal basis, obstructs the German Communist Party from propagating its election program, illegally confiscates Communist Party leaflets and explanatory pamphlets, and obstructs the Communist Party from distributing election-related documents among the people. The Communist Party has been almost completely deprived of the possibility of using radio stations for campaigning.

The statement pointed out that the Adenauer government is afraid that the German people will know the truth about the German situation and the path to peaceful reunification of Germany pointed out by the Communist Party. Therefore, they want to suppress freedom of speech and conduct the Federal Parliament elections in an atmosphere of police and fascist terror.

The Central Committee of the German Communist Party strongly protested against this election system of terror and provocation created from above. The statement emphasized that no one would consider the Federal Parliament elections held under these circumstances to be free and democratic elections.

    德国共产党中央委员会发表声明
    抗议波恩政府禁止德共进行竞选活动
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志通讯社报道，七月三日，德国共产党中央委员会发表声明说，波恩政府所进行的竞选是一个恐怖和挑衅的竞选。
    声明指出，很久以来，波恩政府就竭力想确保未来的联邦议院也采取亲美的方针。因此，它制订了一个与自由、民主的选举的原则毫不相容的选举法。显然是由于波恩政府的指示，各地方当局在最近几天中禁止德国共产党在西德各地举行竞选集会。
    西德各地当局越来越经常地不让德国共产党利用公共建筑物来举行竞选集会，并且威逼私人大厅的所有者，不许他们把房子租给共产党开会。
    利用法西斯团体来破坏共产党竞选集会的事件愈来愈多。在发生这种事件时，警察总是卫护法西斯挑衅者。
    波恩政府毫无法律根据地阻挠德国共产党宣传它的竞选纲领，非法地没收共产党的传单和解释性的小册子，并阻挠共产党在人民中散发有关选举的文件。共产党几乎完全被剥夺了利用广播电台进行竞选的可能性。
    声明指出，阿登纳政府害怕德国人民会知道德国形势的真相和共产党所指出的和平统一德国的道路。因此，他们要压制自由的言论，要在警察和法西斯恐怖中进行联邦议院的选举。
    德国共产党中央委员会坚决抗议这种自上而下制造恐怖和挑衅的选举制度。声明着重指出，没有人会认为在这种情形下举行的联邦议院选举是自由、民主的选举。
