    Learning from Pudovkin, the Outstanding Soviet Film Artist
    Cheng Jihua
    The death of the great Soviet film artist Vsevolod Illarionovich Pudovkin is a great loss to progressive film art worldwide.
    Pudovkin is a name well known to Chinese film audiences. As early as 1931, the film "Storm Over Asia" directed by him was screened in China, which was the first Soviet film to appear before the broad Chinese audience. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the films directed by Pudovkin became artistic treasures loved by the Chinese people even more. Studying and reviewing Pudovkin's artistic experience throughout his life is of great significance to Chinese film artists.
    Pudovkin was born in 1893. Just four months before his death, on February 28th of this year, a grand celebration was held at the "Cinema House" in Moscow to celebrate his 60th birthday. In order to celebrate his 60th birthday and commend his contributions to Soviet film art, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order to award him the Order of the Red Banner of Labor once again. Pudovkin had been awarded the Order of Lenin twice and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor twice, and had won the Stalin Prize three times. He was also awarded the title of "People's Artist of the Soviet Union."
    From the day it was born, Soviet film art has constantly struggled against various anti-realist artistic schools of the bourgeoisie. In this tense and acute struggle, Pudovkin made great contributions with his own creative practice and theoretical writings. Pudovkin's name is inseparable from the birth, formation, and development of Soviet film art.
    Pudovkin began his film production work as an actor. His first successful role was as a Red Army commander in the 1920 film "In the Days of Struggle." In 1921, he played the role of the farmhand Andrei in the film "The Sickle and the Hammer" directed by Gardin. His acting art was commented as "one of the earliest images of Bolshevik revolutionaries created in a realistic style." Even after becoming a famous director, Pudovkin never abandoned his acting activities and his interest in the work of actors. From 1920 to 1947, when he played the role of Prince Menshikov in his own film "Admiral Nakhimov," he played various roles in films directed by himself or others: Red Army soldiers, Tsarist police officers, German officers during World War I, German generals of fascist bandits, and historical figures from various eras. In playing all these roles, Pudovkin proved himself to be an extremely excellent and talented actor. He was an actor who could combine the external description of the image with the psychological portrayal of the character.
    Pudovkin began directing films independently in 1925. In this year, he completed a short comedy "Chess Fever." At the same time, he began preparing to produce another film, wanting to use his newly acquired artistic knowledge to serve the science he had long loved. Thus, at the end of the same year, he completed a film promoting the theory of the great physiologist Pavlov - "Mechanics of the Brain." Even now, this film is still one of the exemplary works in Soviet popular science films.
    After these two attempts at independent directing, Pudovkin began to prepare to direct a large feature film. At that time, many filmmakers were engrossed in the pursuit of formalist techniques, but Pudovkin was inspired by the novel "Mother" by Maxim Gorky, the founder of socialist realism literature and the great proletarian writer. He confidently used it as the theme for his first major feature film. The completion of the film "Mother" in 1926 was the first major victory of realism in film art, a huge victory for realism over formalism in the Soviet film art field at that time, and a major event in the Soviet and global progressive film industry, opening up a new path for the development of film art and raising film art to a new stage. The film "Mother" also won the greatest honor for Soviet films in the international film scene. Since then, Pudovkin has also been recognized as one of the world's most famous film directors. The creative principles that conform to the socialist realism laws in the creation of the film "Mother" were advocated by Pudovkin from the time he began his directing work: to respect the script and to respect the creativity of the actors. He especially valued the achievements of the Stanislavski acting system and attracted actors from the Moscow Art Theater to play important roles in the film. For example, the main characters in the film "Mother," the worker Pavel Vlasov and his mother, were played by Batalov and Baranovskaya from the Moscow Art Theater. The simplicity of the images they created and the richness of the characters' spirit improved and guaranteed the ideological and artistic quality of the film "Mother."
    In 1927, Pudovkin also directed "The End of St. Petersburg," which depicted the October Revolution, and in 1928, he directed "Storm Over Asia," which depicted the oppressed Asian people resisting colonial rulers. These two films were basically based on the creative principles of his direction of "Mother," so they were not only strong in ideology and had vivid characters, but also discovered many extremely important new laws in film performance methods and achieved a high degree of achievement.
    However, Pudovkin also took a tortuous path in the creation of film art. Once he deviated from the above-mentioned correct creative principles, he encountered errors and failures. In a paper he wrote about the film "Simple Case" directed by him from 1929 to 1932, he made such self-criticism of his mistakes: "Pudovkin also served formalism in 'Simple Case.' 'Simple Case' tells about special events in a person's life, about infidelity between husband and wife. When producing this film, the main attention was not placed on the characters, not on their behavior, but on how to place the camera during photography and how to connect the shots unusually during editing. Pudovkin's film is less like a story about the life of a Soviet person and more like a directory of directing techniques." The film "Deserter" directed by him in 1933 also had similar errors. But Pudovkin's interest was after all in portraying the inner lives of characters, and he has always been an artist who devoted himself to expressing the truth of life. Therefore, in 1938, when he produced the film "Victory," he overcame the errors of "Simple Case" and "Deserter" and returned to the realistic path of "Mother."
    After that, Pudovkin directed a series of magnificent historical biography films: "Minin and Pozharsky" (1939), "Suvorov" (1940), "Admiral Nakhimov" (1948), and "Zhukovsky" (1950). These films all praised the glorious history of the Russian people and their fighting heroism, and expressed the patriotism and creative labor of the Russian people. The historical events depicted in these films are substantial, they express the main and typical things, and do not fall into the trivial details of historical descriptions. These films all conform to the principle of truthfully expressing history. Therefore, these films are all heartwarming and make people feel the inseparable internal connection between the glorious past and the present life of the Russian people. At the same time, the actors in these films also showed a high degree of acting skills under the guidance of Pudovkin. Especially the image creation of Suvorov in the film "Suvorov" was praised as "one of the brilliant examples of creative use of the Stanislavski acting system in film art." Pudovkin's major achievements are mainly determined by his profound understanding and correct mastery of socialist realism, but we can also see that Pudovkin's long-term and multifaceted acting practice has also played a major role in the success of his directing work. It is precisely because Pudovkin, as a director, has a deep understanding of the art of acting that he is able to inspire actors, help actors, and create rich and colorful characters in films together with actors when cooperating with them. The brilliant achievements of the art of acting in films such as "Suvorov" and "Admiral Nakhimov" are the best evidence of this.
    Pudovkin's last film was adapted from G. Nikolayeva's famous novel "Harvest." After the film was released, it was unanimously praised by Soviet audiences. Soviet critics also praised Pudovkin's directing talent and skills, believing that the film "poetically expresses the purity of emotions and moral greatness of ordinary Soviet people."
    Pudovkin is very good at summarizing his own creative experience. He emerged in the Soviet film industry as a brave innovator and theoretical activist in film art. At the same time, it is his own multifaceted and rich creative practice that provides the best conditions and foundation for his theoretical writings. As early as when he was directing the film "Mother," he began to teach courses on filmmaking at the Soviet National Film University. His lecture notes "Film Directing and Screenwriting" were quickly translated into German, English, Japanese and other languages at that time, and were welcomed by the majority of film workers in various countries. China also published Pudovkin's book in 1933. This was the first book in China to introduce Soviet film art theory, and it played a significant role for progressive film workers in China at that time. Pudovkin also taught courses on film actors at the National Film University many times. His lecture notes "Film Actors" were later published in Russian, English, German, and Japanese at the same time as a memorial gift for the fifteenth anniversary of Soviet films.
    Just as our great real life requires film workers to strive to improve their political ideology and professional level, we should better study Pudovkin's high degree of consistency between artistic creative practice and theoretical research. We must learn from Pudovkin's spirit of continuous exploration and advancement along the socialist realism creative path, learn from his sincere use of self-criticism to continuously improve his artistic and creative thinking in the Bolshevik spirit, study his many excellent performances in film art, and learn from his good practice of regularly and timely systematizing and synthesizing his experience. In the past few years after the war, Pudovkin published many more mature theoretical articles. He richer and more profoundly developed some of the correct arguments in his early theoretical writings, involving all aspects of film art creation, vividly and repeatedly explaining that socialist realism is the basic, unique and correct creative method of Soviet artists. This creative method can guide artists to the people and make them active fighters in building a communist society. In an article, Pudovkin said: "The reason why we say 'realism' is because our art must grasp life in complex, rich, and advancing movements; the reason why we say 'socialist' is because our creative activities must conform to the highest goal expected by the people of building a socialist society." These few words are also the best explanation of his own creative life for more than 30 years.
    As a member of the Communist Party, Pudovkin was not only an outstanding artist, but also an active fighter for world peace and an excellent social activist. He was the chairman of the Moscow Oblast Peace Committee and a member of the Soviet Peace Committee. He represented the Soviet people at meetings to defend world peace on many occasions. When Pudovkin visited India in 1951, he said at a welcome rally in Calcutta: "I believe that the films I make must face the people and meet the requirements of creating world peace. Our films should be close to the people. The people need peace and oppose war. Therefore, our films should also record the facts of fighting for peace every day and every hour."
    Let our Chinese film workers move forward along this path!

    向苏联卓越的电影艺术家普多夫金学习
    程季华
    伟大的苏联电影艺术家弗谢沃洛德·伊拉里昂诺维奇·普多夫金的逝世，对全世界进步电影艺术都是一个巨大的损失。
    普多夫金是我国电影观众所熟知的名字。早在一九三一年，他所导演的影片“成吉斯汗的后代”就在中国放映了，这是第一部在中国广大观众面前出现的苏联影片。中华人民共和国成立后，普多夫金所导演的影片，更成为我国人民所喜爱的艺术珍品。研究与回顾普多夫金一生的艺术经历，对我国电影艺术工作者有着极重大的意义。
    普多夫金生于一八九三年，就在他逝世的前四个月，今年的二月二十八日，为了庆祝他的六十寿辰，曾在莫斯科的“电影之家”举行了盛大的祝寿晚会。苏联最高苏维埃主席团为了庆祝他的六十寿辰，和表彰他在苏联电影艺术上的功勋，特为发布命令，又一次授予他以劳动红旗勋章。普多夫金曾经两次获得列宁勋章和两次获得劳动红旗勋章，三次获得斯大林奖金，并曾荣获“苏联人民艺术家”的称号。
    苏联的电影艺术，从它诞生的那一天起，就不断地与资产阶级形形色色的反现实主义的艺术流派作斗争，在这个紧张而尖锐的斗争中，普多夫金以他自己的创作实践和理论著述作了巨大的贡献。普多夫金的名字是和苏联电影艺术的诞生、形成和发展分不开的。
    普多夫金参加电影摄制工作，是从演员工作开始的。他第一次成功地扮演了的角色，是一九二○年在影片“在斗争的日子里”扮演的红军指挥员。一九二一年，他在加尔金导演的影片“镰刀与锤子”中扮演雇农安得烈，他的表演艺术被评论为“按照现实主义风格创造的布尔什维克革命家最初的形象之一”。普多夫金就是在成了著名的导演后，也一直没有放弃他的演员的活动和他对演员工作的兴趣。从一九二○年开始，到一九四七年在他自己所导演的影片“海军上将纳希莫夫”中所扮演的缅希柯夫公爵为止，在这二十七年间，他在他自己导演的影片或别人导演的影片中，扮演过各式各样的角色：红军战士、沙皇时代的警官、第一次世界大战时的德国军官、法西斯匪徒的德国将军，以及各个不同时代的历史人物等。普多夫金在扮演这一切角色时，都证明了他是一个极为优秀的、有才能的演员。他是一个能够把形象的外部描写和人物性格的心理刻划相结合的演员。
    普多夫金独立导演影片开始于一九二五年。这一年他完成了一部短的喜剧片“棋迷”。同时，他开始准备摄制另外一部影片，他想用他新学得的艺术知识来服务于自己久已热爱的科学，于是他在同年年底摄制完成了一部宣传伟大的生理学家巴夫洛夫学说的影片——“脑的机能”。直到现在，这部影片仍然是苏联科学普及电影中的典范作品之一。
    普多夫金经过了这两次的独立导演工作的尝试后，他开始着手准备导演大型的艺术片。当时，很多的电影工作者正醉心于形式主义的技巧的追求，而普多夫金却被社会主义现实主义文学的奠基人、伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基的小说“母亲”所鼓舞，他满怀信心地以它来作为自己第一次导演大型艺术片的题材。一九二六年影片“母亲”的摄制完成，是现实主义在电影艺术方面最初的重大胜利，是当时苏联电影艺术领域中现实主义对形式主义斗争的巨大胜利，是苏联和全世界进步电影事业中的大事件，为电影艺术的发展开辟了新道路，把电影艺术提高到了一个新的阶段。影片“母亲”并为苏联电影在国际影坛上获得了最大的荣誉，从此，普多夫金亦被公认为世界最著名的电影导演之一。影片
    “母亲”创作中合乎社会主义现实主义规律的创作原则，是普多夫金从他开始从事导演工作时起所就主张的：要尊重剧本，要尊重演员的创造。他尤其重视史达尼斯拉夫斯基演剧体系的成就，并吸引莫斯科艺术剧院的演员来扮演影片中重要的角色。例如影片“母亲”中的主角，工人伯惠尔·符拉索夫和他的母亲，就都是由莫斯科艺术剧院的演员巴塔洛夫和巴拉诺夫斯卡娅来扮演的。他们所创造的形象的质朴和人物精神的充实，提高并保证了影片
    “母亲”的思想艺术质量。
    普多夫金在一九二七年又导演了表现十月革命的
    “圣彼得堡的末日”，一九二八年导演了描写被压迫的亚洲人民反抗殖民地统治者的“成吉斯汗的后代”。这两部影片基本上都是根据他导演“母亲”的创作原则来进行工作的，因而不仅思想性强，人物形象鲜明，而且在电影表现方法上，也发现了许多极其重要的新的规律，并有着高度的成就。
    可是普多夫金在电影艺术的创作上也走过曲折的道路。当他一旦背离上述正确的创作原则时，就招来了错误和失败。一九二九——一九三二年他所导演的影片“普通事件”，在他写的一篇论文中，曾对自己的错误作过这样的自我批评：“普多夫金在‘普通事件’一片里也为形式主义效劳过。‘普通事件’讲的是一个人生活中的特殊事件，讲到夫妇间的变节。在摄制这部影片的时候，主要的注意力不是放在人物上，不是放在他们的行为上，而是放在摄影时要怎样安放摄影机上，剪接时要怎样把一个个镜头不平常地接在一起。普多夫金的这部电影与其说是它像描写一个苏联人的生活故事，还不如说更像导演手法的目录。”一九三三年他所导演的“逃兵”也有相类似的错误。但普多夫金的兴趣毕竟是在于刻划人物的内心生活，而且一向是倾心于表现生活真实的艺术家，因此，一九三八年他在摄制影片“胜利”时，就克服了“普通事件”和“逃兵”两片的错误，重新回返到“母亲”的现实主义的道路上来。
    此后普多夫金导演了一系列规模宏伟的历史传记片：“米宁和波热尔斯基”（一九三九年）、“苏沃罗夫”（一九四○年）、“海军上将纳希莫夫”
    （一九四八年）、“俄罗斯航空之父儒科夫斯基”
    （一九五○年）。这些影片都歌颂着俄罗斯人民的光荣的历史和他们的战斗的英勇，表现了俄罗斯人民的爱国主义的精神和他们的创造性的劳动。这几部影片所描写的历史事件是实质的，它们表现主要的、典型的事物，而不落入历史的细故枝节的描写。这些影片，都是符合真实地表现历史的原则的。因此这些影片都令人感到亲切，感到俄罗斯人民光荣的过去和现在生活不可分割的内在联系。同时这些影片中的演员在普多夫金的指导下，也都表现出了高度的演员技巧。特别是在影片“苏沃罗夫”中的苏沃罗夫这一角色的形象创造，更被评为“在电影艺术中创造性的运用史达尼斯拉夫斯基演剧体系的光辉范例之一”。普多夫金的这些重大的成就，主要的当然是决定于他对社会主义现实主义的深湛理解和正确的掌握，但我们也可以看到，普多夫金长期的和多方面的演员工作的实践，对于他的导演工作的成就，也起了重大作用的。正是由于作为导演的普多夫金对演员艺术有着深刻的造诣，他才有可能在与演员合作时，启发演员，帮助演员，和演员共同创造出影片中的丰富多采的人物形象来。“苏沃罗夫”、“海军上将纳希莫夫”等片所获得的演员艺术的光辉成就，就是这方面的最好明证。
    普多夫金最后导演的一部影片，是根据格·尼古拉耶娃的著名小说“收获”改编的。影片放映后，受到苏联观众一致好评。苏联评论界也称赞普多夫金的导演才能和技巧，认为这部影片是“富有诗意地表现了普通苏维埃人的感情的纯洁和道德上的伟大”。
    普多夫金极善于总结他自己的创作经验，他是作为电影艺术中勇敢的革新者和理论活动家而出现于苏联电影界的。同时，正是他自己多方面的丰富的创作实践，也为他的理论著述提供了最好的条件和基础。还是在导演影片“母亲”的时候，他就开始在苏联国立电影大学讲授关于电影摄制方面的课程。他所编的讲义“电影编导论”在当时很快地就被译成了德、英、日等国文字，并受到各国广大电影工作者的欢迎。中国在一九三三年也出版了普多夫金的这本著作。这是中国介绍苏联电影艺术理论的第一本书，对当时中国的进步电影工作者是发生过很大作用的。普多夫金也曾多次在国立电影大学讲授关于电影演员方面的课程，他的讲稿“电影演员论”，后来是作为苏联电影十五周年的纪念献礼而用俄、英、德、日四种文字同时出版的。
    正当我国的伟大现实生活，要求电影工作者努力提高自己的政治思想与业务水平的时候，我们更应该很好地学习普多夫金的艺术创作实践与理论研究的高度一致性。我们要学习普多夫金不断地探索与沿着社会主义现实主义创作道路前进的精神，学习他诚恳地运用自我批评使自己在艺术创作思想上不断提高的布尔什维克的精神，研究他在电影艺术上的许多优异表现，学习他经常地、及时地将自己的经验条理化和加以综合的优良作风。普多夫金在战后数年来，发表了不少更为成熟的理论文章，他更丰富、更深刻地发展了他早期理论著述中的一些正确的论点，涉及到电影艺术创造的各个方面，极为生动地、一再反复地说明了社会主义现实主义是苏联艺术家基本的、唯一的、正确的创作方法，这种创作方法是能够引导艺术家走向人民，并使其成为建设共产主义社会的积极战士。普多夫金在一篇文章中说道：“我们之所以要说‘现实主义’，是因为我们的艺术要在复杂、丰富和前进的运动中来掌握生活；我们之所以要说‘社会主义’，是因为我们的创作活动，必须符合建设社会主义社会这样一个人民所期待的最高目的。”这几句话也正好是他自己三十余年来创作生活的最好说明。
    作为共产党党员的普多夫金，他不仅是杰出的艺术家，同时也是积极的保卫世界和平的战士和优秀的社会活动家。他是莫斯科州拥护和平委员会主席，苏联拥护和平委员会的委员，曾多次代表苏联人民出席保卫世界和平的会议。一九五一年普多夫金访问印度时，在加尔各答的欢迎大会上，他曾说：“我相信我自己制作的影片一定面向人民，符合着缔造世界和平的要求。我们的影片应该接近人民，人民需要和平，反对战争，因此，我们的影片也应该记载每天每时为和平而斗争的事实。”
    让我们中国的电影工作者，循着这条道路前进吧！（附图片）
