    On the Issue of Students Going to Factories for Internships
    Reply from the Central Higher Education Department
    The People's Letters Group of the Secretariat Office of the Central People's Government Higher Education Department wrote: The "Reader's Letters" column on March 27th published a letter of suggestion from all graduate students of the Chemistry Department of Tianjin University regarding the issue of "Factories and mines should actively guide students going to factories for internships." Because our inspection work was not thorough enough, this issue was delayed for a long time without a reply; in addition to ordering the relevant comrades to conduct a review, we will pay attention to correcting this in the future.
    Regarding the issue of students going to factories for internships, our department has already submitted the "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Strengthening Production Internship Work for Students in Universities and Secondary Technical Schools" to the State Council's Political Affairs Conference, which will be announced soon. At the same time, according to the information obtained from contacts between our department and responsible comrades from various business departments, they all attach great importance to students' production internships; this spirit has been conveyed to units under the jurisdiction of various business departments. The issue of students going to factories for internships will be properly resolved in the future.

    关于学生下厂实习问题
    中央高等教育部来信答复
    中央人民政府高等教育部办公厅秘书处人民来信组来信：三月二十七日“读者来信”栏刊载了天津大学化学系全体研究生关于“厂矿单位应该积极指导下厂学生进行实习”问题的建议信。因为我们的检查工作做得不够，以致这个问题拖了很长时间未作答复；我们除令有关同志检讨外，今后当注意纠正。
    关于学生下厂实习问题，我部已提请政务院政务会议通过“中央人民政府政务院关于加强高等学校与中等技术学校学生生产实习工作的决定”，最近即可公布。同时，根据我部和各业务部门负责同志接触所了解的情况，他们都很重视学生的生产实习；这种精神并已下达各业务部门所属单位。今后学生下厂实习问题是会得到适当解决的。
