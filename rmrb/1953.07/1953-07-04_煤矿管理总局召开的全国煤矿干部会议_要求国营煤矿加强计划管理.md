    The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened the Second National Coal Mine Cadre Conference from June 22nd to 29th. The conference requested that the leading cadres of 29 state-owned coal mining enterprises across the country further strengthen planned management to complete the state's production plan in a balanced and safe manner.
    At the meeting, Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and Xu Daben, Vice Minister, gave important instructions to the representatives. Sun Ran, Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, gave a report on the situation and tasks of coal mine industrial production and construction this year. In the first half of this year, the Coal Mine Management Bureau and the Mining Bureaus did not fully appreciate the new situation in large-scale economic construction in their guiding ideology, and lacked sufficient understanding that comprehensively completing the national plan was a serious political and economic task. Therefore, from a national perspective, the coal mining industry failed to comprehensively complete the state plan in terms of output, quality, efficiency, safety, and cost. In order to reverse this situation, the conference determined that the central task of coal mine production in the second half of this year is to strengthen planned management, establish a responsibility system, complete and over fulfill the state plan in a balanced and safe manner, and vigorously strengthen tunneling work to prepare for larger-scale production next year.
    Based on the current coal mine production situation and characteristics, the conference believes that strengthening planned management should start with the formulation and implementation of work assignments and strengthening production scheduling. The steps for formulating and implementing work assignments are to specifically stipulate the monthly plans (including indicators, engineering drawings, daily indicators, and instructions) for the entire mine and each production unit (including pit entrances, workshops, sections, and teams) based on the enterprise's overall plan and after discussion by all employees; and based on the monthly plan, assign daily work assignments in the shift handover instructions, and require all workshops to implement operating procedures and chart management. In order to ensure and supervise the implementation of work assignments and direct production based on work assignments, production scheduling must be strengthened. The conference also specifically requested that in July, except for certain Mining Bureaus and mines with particularly poor work foundations, each Mining Bureau should first conduct trials in one mine and one pit to gain experience, compile monthly plans and operating procedures, establish a scheduling system, solve the necessary communication equipment, and make good preparations. By September, 50% of the mines and pits are required to implement these measures, and by the end of the year, 80% of the mines and pits should be implementing them. At the same time, in order to better complete tasks in a balanced way, each Mining Bureau must vigorously carry out tunneling work, requiring that preparation work faces equivalent to one-quarter of the production work faces are always maintained.
    Regarding capital construction, the conference determined that the central task in the second half of the year is to strengthen construction site management, establish a responsibility system, improve quality, and ensure the completion of capital construction tasks. Specific regulations were also made for drilling, construction, and design work. In terms of drilling, it is required to ensure that the core recovery rate reaches 65% or more; the coal core recovery rate reaches 50% or more, and a geological report should be submitted within one month after the drilling is completed.
    In addition to asking everyone to more actively learn from Soviet advanced experience, strengthen planned management, and cultivate cadres, Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, called on leaders at all levels to lead all employees to increase production and conserve more wealth for the country, and over fulfill the state's capital accumulation plan. Vice Minister Xu Daben analyzed the political and economic significance of completing and over fulfilling the first year of the state plan in the large-scale economic construction, greatly inspiring the representatives and increasing their confidence and strength in completing the state plan.
    The conference also heard reports from Soviet experts.
    The conference conducted in-depth discussions in groups by Mining Bureau. Focusing on the characteristics and specific circumstances of each Mining Bureau, the conference studied the guidelines and tasks for production and construction in the second half of this year, and proposed specific work steps and leadership methods. Many representatives expressed their determination to learn from Soviet advanced experience with the most resolute attitude, strengthen planned management, establish a responsibility system, and tap the potential in production and capital construction to ensure the balanced and safe completion of this year's state plan. The coal mine management bureaus of various major regions have put forward preliminary struggle goals for increasing production and practicing economy, and are determined to lead all employees to fight for the realization of this glorious task.

    煤矿管理总局召开的全国煤矿干部会议
    要求国营煤矿加强计划管理
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局于六月二十二日到二十九日召开了第二次全国煤矿干部会议。这次会议要求全国二十九个国营煤矿企业的领导干部进一步加强计划管理工作，均衡地安全地完成国家的生产计划。
    会上，中央燃料工业部部长陈郁、副部长徐达本向到会代表作了重要的指示，煤矿管理总局局长孙然作了关于今年煤矿工业生产和建设的情况与任务的报告。今年上半年，由于煤矿管理总局和矿务局在领导思想上没有充分估计到大规模经济建设中的新情况，对全面地完成国家计划是严重的政治任务和经济任务一点认识不足，因而从全国来说，煤矿工业的产量、质量、效率、安全、成本等各方面，都没有能够全面地完成国家计划。为了扭转这种局面，会议确定今年下半年煤矿生产的中心任务是加强计划管理，建立责任制，均衡地安全地完成和超额完成国家计划，大力加强掘进工作，为明年更大规模的生产准备好条件。
    根据目前煤矿生产的情况和特点，会议认为加强计划管理应该从制订和贯彻作业任务、加强生产调度工作着手。制订和贯彻作业任务的步骤，是根据企业的整个计划，经过全体职工群众的讨论，具体地规定全矿以及各个生产单位（包括坑口、车间、区段、班组）的每月计划（包括指标、工程图、每日指标和说明书）；根据月计划，在交接班指示中分配日作业任务，并要求各车间必须贯彻作业规程与图表管理。为了保证和监督作业任务的执行，并根据作业任务指挥生产，必须加强生产调度工作。会议还具体要求在七月份，除工作基础特别差的某些矿务局和矿以外，各矿务局都应在一个矿一个坑首先试行，取得经验，编制出月计划和作业规程，建立调度制度，解决必需的通讯设备，并作好各项准备工作。到九月份，要求有百分之五十的矿、坑实行起来，到年底应有百分之八十的矿、坑实行起来。同时，为了更好地均衡完成任务，各矿务局必须大力进行掘进工作，要求经常保持有相当于生产工作面四分之一的准备工作面。
    关于基本建设，会议确定下半年中心工作是加强工地管理，建立责任制，提高质量，保证完成基本建设任务。对于钻探、施工、设计工作等任务也作了具体规定。在钻探方面，要求保证岩芯采取率达到百分之六十五以上；煤芯采取率达到百分之五十以上，打完钻眼后应保证在一个月内提出地质报告。
    中央燃料工业部陈郁部长除要求大家更积极地学习苏联先进经验，加强计划管理和培养干部以外，并号召各级领导干部带领全体职工群众为国家增产节约更多的财富，超额完成国家积累资金的计划。徐达本副部长分析了完成和超额完成国家大规模经济建设中第一年国家计划的政治意义和经济意义，给到会代表以极大的鼓舞，增加了完成国家计划的信心和力量。
    会议还听取了苏联专家的报告。
    会议以矿务局为单位分组进行了深入的讨论。针对着各矿务局的特点与具体情况，研究了今年下半年生产与建设的方针任务，提出了具体的工作步骤和领导方法。许多代表都表示要以最坚决的态度来学习苏联先进经验，加强计划管理，建立责任制，发掘生产与基本建设中的潜力，来保证均衡地安全地完成今年的国家计划。各大区的煤矿管理局已提出了增产节约的初步奋斗目标，决心带领全体职工为实现这一光荣任务而斗争。
