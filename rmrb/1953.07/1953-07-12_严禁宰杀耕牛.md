    Strictly Prohibit the Slaughter of Cattle
    Cattle are an important power source in our country's current agricultural production. The People's Government has always attached importance to protecting cattle and strictly prohibits the slaughter of cattle. However, according to reports from some areas recently, the phenomenon of illegal butchers slaughtering cattle continues to occur. In Pingxifu Village and Xiaoxinzhuang Village in Changping County, Hebei Province, butchers slaughtered 530 cattle from January to May, including 148 cattle that were eight years old. It is understood that the butchers in these two villages often go to Hebei, Henan, Anhui and other places to purchase a large number of cattle, feed them for a period of time, and then falsely report them as beef cattle for slaughter. Obviously, this illegal behavior will seriously affect agricultural production.
    Why can butchers disregard government decrees and arbitrarily slaughter cattle? This is mainly because the cadres of the industrial, commercial, health, and taxation departments in various places do not have enough understanding of the speculative behavior of butchers, neglect inspection work, or have low cattle inspection skills and cannot distinguish between beef cattle and cattle. Butchers take advantage of this loophole. Cattle are thinner and the purchase cost is lower than that of beef cattle, and cattle hides are more expensive. As long as they are fed for a short period of time, the unique nodules (commonly known as "tao hua") on the necks of cattle will disappear, and butchers will falsely report cattle as beef cattle for slaughter, seeking high profits. This situation should attract the attention of industrial, commercial, health, and taxation departments.
    In order to eliminate the phenomenon of slaughtering cattle, cadres of agriculture, industry, commerce, health, and taxation departments in various places should ideologically recognize the importance of protecting livestock, strengthen the management of slaughterhouses, continuously improve the technical level of inspection personnel, educate and appropriately deal with butchers who privately slaughter cattle, mobilize the masses and law-abiding butchers to report and fight against illegal butchers, and strictly prohibit the slaughter of cattle!

    严禁宰杀耕牛
    耕牛是我国当前农业生产中的重要动力，人民政府历来是重视保护耕牛，严禁屠宰耕牛的。但是，最近据若干地区反映，不法屠商宰杀耕牛的现象不断发生。河北省昌平县平西府村、小辛庄两村屠商，一月份至五月份宰杀耕牛五百三十只，其中八岁口的耕牛有一百四十八只。据了解，这两个村的屠商经常到河北、河南、安徽等地大量购买耕牛，喂养一个时期，便冒充菜牛报验宰杀。十分显然，这种非法行为必将严重地影响农业生产。
    为什么屠商竟能不顾政府法令，任意宰杀耕牛呢？这主要是因为各地工商、卫生及税务部门的干部对屠商的投机行为认识不足，疏于检验工作，或验牛技术低，不能把菜牛和耕牛加以区别，而屠商就钻了这个空子。耕牛较瘦，购进成本比菜牛低，耕牛皮张又较贵，只要喂上一个短的时期，耕牛的颈项上的特有疙瘩（俗称套花）就会消失，屠商就把耕牛冒充菜牛宰杀，谋取高额利润。这种情形是应该引起工商、卫生、税务部门注意的。
    为了杜绝宰杀耕牛现象，各地农业、工商、卫生和税务部门的干部应从思想上认识保护耕畜的重要意义，加强屠场管理工作；不断地提高检验人员的技术水平；对私宰耕牛的屠商应进行教育并适当加以处理；发动群众和守法的屠商进行检举，向不法屠商作斗争，严禁宰杀耕牛！
