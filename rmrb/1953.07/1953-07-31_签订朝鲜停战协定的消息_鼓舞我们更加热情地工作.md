    The News of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Encourages Us to Work More Enthusiastically
    A letter from Xie Binglin and nine others from the Beijing Branch Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union: When we heard the news on the radio that the Korean Armistice Agreement had been officially signed, everyone felt very happy. The Korean armistice negotiations, which lasted for more than two years, have finally reached an agreement. This is a great joy that everyone has been looking forward to day and night, and it is also the result of the joint efforts of the Chinese and Korean people in adhering to the anti-aggression struggle and the peace-loving people all over the world.
    Many units immediately held symposiums after listening to the broadcast. Fu Zhenxun, an old worker from the Beijing East Railway Station Telegraph Office, said happily: The success of the armistice negotiations proves the strength of our power. Wang 煃 continued: When we welcome the great victory of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, we must not relax our vigilance, because Syngman Rhee is still deliberately carrying out sabotage. Li Baotian from the Beijing Power Distribution Station said: Although the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, this is only the first step towards a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The Syngman Rhee clique and the belligerent elements of American imperialism are still clamoring. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance. Yin Shumin from the Anti-US and Aid Korea Committee Office of the Beijing Transportation Bureau said: The great victory of the Anti-US and Aid Korea struggle made me feel very excited. I will do my current work a hundred times more diligently and use practical actions to strive for the complete victory of the Korean issue. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, expressing their warm support for the complete agreement reached in the Korean armistice negotiations, and expressing their determination not to relax their vigilance and to continue fighting for the comprehensive realization of peace in Korea.
    After the discussions, the workers returned to their work posts and worked more enthusiastically and intensely. The Beijing Power Distribution Station's repair team decided to complete the year's production tasks two months ahead of schedule on the basis of consolidating labor discipline; the Beijing East Railway Station Telegraph Office team will celebrate the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in the movement to defend world peace by eliminating errors and completing the team's production and financial plan.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    签订朝鲜停战协定的消息
    鼓舞我们更加热情地工作
    中国铁路工会北京分区委员会谢炳琳等十人来信：当我们从收音机里听到朝鲜停战协定已经正式签字的消息后，每个人都感到十分高兴。历时两年多的朝鲜停战谈判终于达成了协议，这是大家朝夕盼望着的一件大喜事，也是朝中人民坚持反侵略斗争和全世界爱好和平人民共同努力的结果。
    很多单位在听完广播后立即举行座谈会。北京东站电报所老工人傅振勋高兴地说：停战谈判的成功，正说明咱们力量的强大。王煃接着说：我们在迎接朝鲜停战协定签订的伟大胜利时，决不能放松警惕，因为李承晚还在蓄意进行破坏。北京配电所李宝田说：朝鲜停战协定虽然已经签了字，但这不过是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，李承晚集团和美帝国主义的好战分子还在继续叫嚣，我们必须保持高度警惕性。北京运输分局抗美援朝委员会办公室殷淑敏表示：抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利使我感到万分兴奋，我要百倍努力地做好目前的工作，以实际行动来争取朝鲜问题的彻底胜利。大家发言都很热烈，一方面表示对朝鲜停战谈判全部达成协议表示热烈拥护，另一方面又表示了决不放松警惕，要为朝鲜和平的全面实现而继续斗争。
    讨论结束后，工人们回到工作岗位上更加热情、紧张地进行工作。北京配电所包修组决定在巩固劳动纪律的基础上提前两个月完成全年的生产任务；北京东站电报所小组要以消灭错误、完成小组生产财务计划来庆祝朝中人民在保卫世界和平运动中取得的伟大胜利。
