Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 14th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean and Chinese Delegation issued the following communique on July 14th:

    At approximately 9:10 PM on July 12th, a shell fired from the opposing side's position exploded approximately 150 meters within the perimeter of the Panmunjom conference area.

    Therefore, our Chief Liaison Officer sent a letter to the opposing side's Chief Liaison Officer on July 14th, drawing their serious attention to the matter; pointing out that the above incident not only constitutes a direct violation of the conference area safety agreement but also could lead to unfortunate consequences for both sides, requesting the other side to earnestly restrain their armed personnel so that similar incidents do not occur again.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 14th: At 9:10 PM on the evening of July 12th, a shell fired from the US military position along the Yuryong-ri Buksan line, southeast of Panmunjom, landed in the Panmunjom conference area, violating the agreement that the conference area should be free from all attacks.

    Security officers from both sides jointly went to the scene on the 12th to investigate and discovered numerous small bullet marks on a hillside approximately 150 meters inside the eighth marker along the edge of the conference area. The bullet mark area was approximately 20 meters in diameter, proving that it was a high-explosive shrapnel shell fired by the US military. When the investigators from both sides arrived at the point of impact, it was immediately apparent that a small tree trunk, severed by shrapnel, was lying diagonally on the hillside, with fresh green leaves still on the branches. In the presence of the US security officer, our security officer dug out pieces of shrapnel from various craters and handed them to him. The US security officer admitted on the spot that these fragments were indeed fragments of an exploded shell.

    When the security officers from both sides had just begun their investigation, shells from the US military position on the right bank of the Imjin River again exploded near the Panmunjom conference area. Two smoke shells landed on a hill about 200 meters east of the crater, with white smoke rising into the air.

    After the on-site investigation, the military police in the conference area, who witnessed the incident, presented evidence to the security officers from both sides. They proved that the shells were fired from the US military position. We have requested the US side to pay serious attention to this incident.

    我方首席联络官致函美方要求严重注意美方炮弹射入会场区事件
    【新华社开城十四日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团七月十四日发表公报如下：
    七月十二日晚九时十分左右，由对方阵地发射出的炮弹一颗，射入板门店会场区周界内大约一百五十公尺处爆炸。
    为此，我方首席联络官七月十四日致函对方首席联络官，提起对方严重注意；指出上述事件不仅构成了对会场区安全协议的直接违反，而且可能造成对双方来说都是不幸的后果，要求对方认真约束对方武装人员，使类似事件不再发生。
    【新华社开城十四日电】十二日晚上九点十分，从板门店东南鱼龙里北山一线美军阵地打来的炮弹一颗，落入板门店会场区，违反了会场区免受一切攻击的协议。
    双方安全军官在十二日共同赴现场调查，发现了在距离会场区边上第八号标志牌内约一百五十公尺的山坡上，有许多小弹痕，弹痕散布面积的直径约二十公尺，证明了这是美军打来的一颗空中爆炸的榴霰弹。当双方调查人员一到弹着点时，就很明显地看到一棵被弹片炸断了的小树干斜倒在山坡上，枝上的绿叶犹新。我方安全军官当着美方安全军官的面，从各个弹坑里把一块块小弹片扒出来交在他手里。美方安全军官当场承认了这些弹片确是炮弹爆炸的碎弹片。
    当双方安全军官刚一开始进行调查的时候，来自临津江右岸美军阵地上的炮弹，又在板门店会场地区附近隆隆地爆炸起来。两颗烟幕弹，正落在弹坑东面约二百公尺山头上，白色的烟硝，凌空而上。
    现场调查后，目睹这一事件的会场区军事警察向双方安全军官提出证据。他们证明了炮弹是从美军阵地打来的。对于这一事件，我方已要求美方严重注意。
