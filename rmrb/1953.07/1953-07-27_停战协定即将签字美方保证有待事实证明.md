Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 26th: Special Correspondent Wu Min reports: After two years and seventeen days of ceasefire negotiations, the Korean Armistice Agreement will be signed at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on July 27th. Twelve hours after the signing – that is, at 10:00 PM on July 27th – a full ceasefire will take effect in Korea. Full agreement has been reached on all clauses of the Armistice Agreement, and these clauses will take effect simultaneously with the ceasefire.

The liaison officers' meeting on July 26th agreed to announce the signing date of the Armistice Agreement and the signing method at 4:00 PM on the 26th.

The signing ceremony will take place in a new, spacious hall built specifically for the signing. The chief representatives of both sides, General Nam Il and Lieutenant General Harrison, will first sign the Armistice Agreement in Korean, Chinese, and English. Then, the Armistice Agreement will be sent to Marshal Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, for signature.

All military forces, supplies, and equipment will be withdrawn from the Demilitarized Zone within seventy-two hours after the Armistice Agreement takes effect at 10:00 PM on July 27th.

All peace-loving people around the world will welcome the signing of the Armistice Agreement with hope and vigilance. The Korean and Chinese side has already guaranteed that once the Armistice Agreement is signed and takes effect, they will implement all ceasefire terms. The US side's guarantee regarding the full implementation of the ceasefire terms remains to be proven by facts. As General Nam Il pointed out, if the United States' policy of indulgence continues, the implementation of the Armistice Agreement clauses, both before and after the ceasefire, may continue to be undermined.

When the Armistice Agreement is signed on the morning of July 27th, the first test of whether the United States will implement the ceasefire terms is whether all United Nations forces – including Syngman Rhee's troops – will cease fire and withdraw from the Demilitarized Zone within the prescribed time.

    停战协定即将签字美方保证有待事实证明
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：经过了两年零十七天的停战谈判之后，朝鲜停战协定将在七月二十七日上午十时（朝鲜时间）在板门店签字。在签字后十二小时——即在七月二十七日下午十时起在朝鲜将全面停火。双方在停战协定的一切条款上都已全面达成协议，这些条款将与停火同时生效。
    七月二十六日的联络官会议同意在二十六日下午四时公布停战协定签字日期以及签字方式。
    签字仪式将在专门为举行签字而建筑起来的新的宽敞的大厅中举行，届时双方首席代表南日大将和哈利逊中将将首先在朝鲜文、中文和英文的停战协定上签字。然后，停战协定将送交朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军以及联合国军总司令克拉克上将签字。
    一切军事力量、供应和装备将于停战协定在七月二十七日下午十时生效后七十二小时内从非军事区撤出。
    全世界一切爱好和平的人民将怀着希望和警惕的心情来欢迎停战协定签字的日子。朝中方面业已保证：一旦停战协定签字和生效后，他们将实施一切停战条款。美国方面关于全面实施停战条款的保证，仍然有待事实来证明。正如南日大将所指出的，如果美国的纵容政策继续下去，则不论在停战前后，停战协定条款的实施均有继续遭受破坏的可能。
    当停战协定在七月二十七日上午签字以后，美国是否实施停战条款的第一个考验就是：一切联合国军队——包括李承晚的军队在内——是否会在规定时间以内停火并从非军事区撤退。
