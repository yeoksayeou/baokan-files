    The Shanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration's Policy on Running an Amateur Troupe is Wrong
    Reader Hong Feng writes: The amateur troupe affiliated with the Shanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration borrowed the Taiyuan People's Theater and Heping Theater to perform Peking Opera publicly for six times from May 20th to 30th this year, selling tickets to the public. Approximately fifty employees participated in the performances, and they had to leave work two and a half hours early each day, and wouldn't finish until late at night. The actors suffered from lack of sleep, which affected their health; internal work within the bureau suffered as a result.
    The emergence of this situation is inseparable from the erroneous thinking and practices of certain leaders in the Postal and Telecommunications Administration who want to run the amateur troupe like a regular troupe. In order to make the troupe "presentable," the Postal and Telecommunications Administration violated financial regulations last year, misappropriating surplus funds that should have been turned over and sending someone to Hangzhou to purchase a very elaborate set of costumes for the amateur troupe; as a result, more money was spent, and it was impossible to get reimbursed, so the bureau decided to have the troupe perform publicly this year to make up for the income. The proceeds from ticket sales for this performance, after expenses, left a surplus, which was then used to purchase a beautiful large curtain for the troupe. In addition, in order to recruit performers, the bureau even pulled Huang Xianglan, a counselor from Taiyuan No. 2 Primary School who could sing opera, into the bureau to work.
    The Shanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration's policy on running an amateur troupe is wrong. It not only fails to achieve the goal of improving employees' health, but also affects production and employees' health. This erroneous practice should be corrected quickly.

### 山西邮电管理局办业余剧团的方针有错误

    山西邮电管理局办业余剧团的方针有错误
    读者红风来信：山西邮电管理局所属业余剧团在今年五月二十日到三十日借太原市人民剧院及和平剧院公开售票演出了六次京剧。参加演出的职工共约五十余人，每天都得提前两小时半下班，晚上要到深夜才能搞完。演员们睡眠不足影响健康；局内工作因而受到损失。
    这种情况的产生，是和邮电管理局某些领导同志想把业余剧团办得和正规剧团一样的错误思想和错误做法分不开的。邮电管理局为了使剧团“像样”，在去年竟违反财政制度，挪用应该上缴的结余款，派专人到杭州去为业余剧团置备了一箱很讲究的戏装；结果钱用多了，没法报销，局方就决定让剧团今年公开演出，以收入弥补。这次演戏售票所得除开支外还有剩余，于是又为剧团购置了一个漂亮的大帷幕。此外，局方为了网罗演剧人员，竟把会唱戏的太原市第二完全小学辅导员黄香兰拉到局内工作。
    山西邮电管理局这种办业余剧团的方针是错误的，不但不能达到增进职工健康的目的，反倒影响了生产和职工健康。这种错误做法应该赶快纠正。
