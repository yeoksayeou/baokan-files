Huanan County, Songjiang Province, experienced many deviations in policy implementation this spring. The County Party Committee neglected to grasp and publicize policies, and many district and village cadres secretly established agricultural production cooperatives without considering specific conditions. For example, there were five group horse-feeding teams in Beian Village, Eighth District. Some districts and villages blindly formed large groups and restricted small groups. For example, Democratic Village in the Ninth District merged all small groups into large groups. This phenomenon had a very negative impact in rural areas, causing many misunderstandings among the masses. In Beian Village, Eighth District, villagers disagreed with the cadres' organization of group horse-feeding teams, but the village cadres used various methods to force the masses to organize. Village cadres incorrectly promoted to the masses: "Join the cooperative early, join late, you'll have to join sooner or later; joining early is better than joining late." "Not wanting to collectively feed horses means not wanting communism." On the other hand, they used methods such as "pacts" and apportionments to force farmers to join the group. The Democratic Village branch in the Ninth District put forward the slogan "Don't cultivate too much land, exceeding five hectares is exploitation" among the farmers, causing many farmers with more than five hectares of land to hand over their land to the public. As a result, all eight mutual aid teams in the village had "public property," and the masses, not understanding the policies, became even more uneasy.

There were also many serious problems in lending, renting, hiring, and land sales, mainly the confusion of Party principles and social policies, and the inability to distinguish between well-off farmers and rich peasants. People with money and grain were afraid to lend it out, or lent it secretly. Some wealthy households in Democratic Village, Ninth District, secretly lent money to businessmen in Jiamusi, while complaining of "no money" in the village. Because rural lending was not active, some poor households could not solve the problem of food and seeds, expressing dissatisfaction with the government.

After learning about these problems, the CPC Huanan County Committee led the county and district cadres to seriously study the Central Committee's instructions and resolutions on spring plowing production and mutual aid and cooperation. It also organized county-level reporters to go deep into districts and villages. On the one hand, they taught policies to district and village reporters and propagandists, and on the other hand, they met directly with the masses to specifically and comprehensively explain the policies to them. The County Party Committee also held an enlarged meeting of district and village cadres to conduct in-depth and comprehensive policy education.

After the comprehensive and in-depth implementation of policies in various districts and villages, the thinking of party members, cadres, and the masses was clarified, and the enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. Lending in Sihe Village became active, and the difficulties of poor households were resolved. After policy education in Democratic Village, Ninth District, the masses generally felt enlightened. Wealthy household Gao Fenglin said: "This time, it feels like two doors have been opened in my heart, it's really a relief!" Xue Wanren said: "This time, I can really count on it, I have to work hard." Before the policy education, continuous heavy rains threatened to ruin the crops, and the masses in Democratic Village did not think of solutions while sleeping; after the policy education, the masses actively took action to drain water and dig trenches, and rush-planted large fields; in just half a day on the afternoon of May 24, they dug more than three li of water trenches and rescued more than 150 hectares of soybeans.

### 桦南县贯彻政策后提高了群众生产积极性

    桦南县贯彻政策后提高了群众生产积极性
    今年春天，松江省桦南县在执行政策方面发生了许多偏差。该县县委忽视了对政策的掌握和宣传教育，不少区村干部不根据具体条件，偷偷地搞起了农业生产合作社。第八区北安村就有五个伙喂马组。有些区村盲目地编大组、限制小组。如第九区民主村把小组都合并为大组。这种现象在农村中引起了极不良的影响，使群众有不少误解。八区北安村干部组织伙喂马组，群众不同意；村干部就采用各种方法，强使群众组织。村干部一面向群众错误地宣传：“早入社，晚入社，早晚得入；早入就比晚入强。”“不愿集体喂马就是不愿到共产主义。”另一方面采用“公约”、摊派等办法强制农民入组。九区民主村支部在农民中提出“不许多种地，超过五垧为剥削”的口号，因而使很多有五垧地以上的农民把自己的地拿出交公。这样，全村八个互助组就都有了“公共财产”，群众不了解政策，就更加不安。
    在借贷、租佃、雇佣、土地买卖等方面也存在着很多严重问题，主要的是把党内原则和社会政策混淆了，把富裕农民和富农分不清。群众有钱有粮不敢往外借，或者是明不借暗中借。九区民主村有些富裕户，暗中把钱借给佳木斯的商人，而自己在村中则吵“没有钱”。由于农村借贷不活跃，有些贫困户缺吃粮、籽种没法解决，对政府表示不满。
    中共桦南县委了解了这些问题，就领导县区干部认真学习中央关于春耕生产和互助合作的指示、决议；并组织县级报告员，深入区、村，一方面给区、村报告员、宣传员传授政策，一方面和群众直接见面，向群众具体地全面地交代政策。县委还召开了区、村干部扩大会议，深入地全面地进行了政策教育。
    各区、村全面地深入地贯彻政策以后，党员、干部和群众的思想澄清了，生产积极性大为提高。四合村借贷活跃了，贫困户的困难也解决了。九区民主村进行了政策教育以后，群众普遍感到心里亮堂了；富裕户郜凤林说：“这回心里像开了二扇门似的，可真痛快啦！”薛万仁说：“这回可托底了，得好好干了。”在进行政策教育以前，连绵大雨，庄稼要浸坏，民主村群众睡觉不想办法；进行政策教育以后，群众积极行动起来顺水挖壕，抢种大田；只在五月二十四日下午半天就挖了三里多长的水壕，抢救了一百五十多垧大豆。（马健）
