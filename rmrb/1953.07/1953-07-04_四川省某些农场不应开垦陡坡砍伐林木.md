    Certain Farms in Sichuan Province Should Not Reclaim Steep Slopes and Cut Down Trees
    Tu Zhebng, of the production section of the Xin Sheng Farm in Sichuan Province, writes: Xin Sheng Farm has opened up more than 7,000 mu of mountain land. About 40% of this mountain land is on steep slopes of over 20 degrees, and some slopes are as steep as 40 or 50 degrees. 80% of this land used to be lush forests or bamboo forests. The relevant leading organs of the Southwest Administrative Region and Sichuan Province have regulations prohibiting the opening of steep slopes above 20 degrees. Our farm's violation of this policy is very harmful to protecting national forest resources and promoting soil and water conservation. What is even more serious is that while farmers in the villages where our farm is located are carrying out afforestation and tree protection activities, our farm is reclaiming steep slopes and cutting down trees, which has a very bad impact on the farmers. For example, sometimes when farmers are planting trees in front of the mountains, our farm is opening up the mountains behind them, and the farmers say strangely: "They tell us to plant trees, but the farm is cutting down trees; what's the reason for this?" Some people are therefore beginning to doubt the policy of forest protection.
    I have raised this issue with the farm leadership several times, but it has not been accepted. Later, I reported this situation to the Southwest Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, but it was not taken seriously either. It should be pointed out that the farms of Wu Huan and Lei Ma Ping and certain county-level labor reform teams in Sichuan Province are also opening up steep slopes indiscriminately. I believe that the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy organs and public security organs of the Southwest Region and Sichuan Province should jointly inspect this issue in various places and correct the practice of farms of labor reform teams at all levels opening up steep slopes.

### 四川省某些农场不应开垦陡坡砍伐林木

    四川省某些农场不应开垦陡坡砍伐林木
    四川省新胜农场生产科屠者彬来信：新胜农场开了七千多亩山地。这些山地有百分之四十左右是二十度以上的陡坡，有的坡度高达四、五十度；其中百分之八十原来是很茂盛的树林或竹林。西南行政区和四川省的有关领导机关都有禁开二十度以上陡坡的规定。我场这种违反政策的行为，对保护国家森林资源和推行水土保持工作都是很有害的。而更严重的是，在我场所在地的各乡村农民正开展护林、造林运动的时候，我场却在开垦陡坡、砍伐林木，对农民影响很不好。如有时农民群众正在山前造林，我场却在后面开山，农民们奇怪地说：“叫我们造林，农场却在砍树；这是什么道理？”有的因而对护林政策发生怀疑。
    对于这个问题，我曾几次向农场领导方面提出意见；但都没有被接受。后来，我又曾向西南农林水利局反映这个情况，但也未被重视。应该指出，四川省巫缓、雷马坪和某些县级劳动改造队的农场也都有乱开陡坡的情况。我认为：西南区和四川省的农林水利机关和公安机关应该协同各地检查这个问题，纠正各级劳动改造队的农场这种开垦陡坡的做法。
