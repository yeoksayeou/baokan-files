Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The Hong Kong "New Evening News," published on the afternoon of the 27th, featured a front-page "Special Report" revealing that the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan are colluding with the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in South Korea, attempting to disrupt the armistice and forcibly detain more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. The New Evening News reports that, according to people who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Taiwan, Kuomintang special agents are intensifying their efforts to create new incidents among the non-directly repatriated Chinese prisoners of war held on Jeju Island, in an attempt to undermine the Korean armistice.

According to these individuals, there are more than 14,000 non-directly repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the third prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island. These prisoners of war are supposed to be handed over to neutral nations for custody after the armistice. Recently, in light of the impending signing of the armistice agreement, Kuomintang special agents are intensifying their activities to create incidents in which prisoners of war oppose the transfer, demand "on-the-spot release," and be sent to Taiwan. They are also preparing to force these prisoners of war to rush out of the prisoner-of-war camp through tunnels and wall holes dug by the special agents. Kuomintang special agents are operating in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp under the guise of U.S. military interpreters, one of whom is named Du Guangtai.

These individuals also stated that the Kuomintang, with the assistance of the U.S. military, began stationing special agents in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp around July 1951. At that time, Kuomintang special agents Wang Shunqing, Li Da'an, and others, after receiving special agent training in Tokyo by the U.S. military, returned to Geoje Island and established a special agent organization in the prisoner-of-war camp. Starting in April 1952, the U.S. military, with the assistance of Kuomintang special agents, conducted "screening," using methods such as withholding food, forced tattooing and writing blood letters, and on-the-spot beatings, executions, and disembowelment to coerce prisoners of war to "oppose repatriation."

These individuals pointed out that around the time an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was reached at the Panmunjom negotiations in early June, the Kuomintang colluded with Syngman Rhee to "release" prisoners of war. To carry out this plan, the Kuomintang sent a special agent leader named Chen Jianzhong to South Korea to conspire with Wang Dongyuan, the Kuomintang ambassador to South Korea, and jointly arrange the plan through Syngman Rhee's confidant, Zhang Xirun, and others. After Syngman Rhee ordered the "release" of 27,000 North Korean prisoners of war, Kuomintang special agents also escorted more than 100 Chinese prisoners of war from Dongnae (near Busan) and arranged for Kuomintang special agents in Busan disguised as "overseas Chinese leaders" to receive them, dispersing and hiding more than 50 of them in Busan, and providing them with assistance through Wang Dongyuan, the Kuomintang ambassador to South Korea. Subsequently, Kuomintang special agents further instigated the "release" of prisoners of war on Jeju Island, forging letters written in blood by prisoners of war to Eisenhower, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, demanding "on-the-spot release" and "to go to Taiwan." At the same time, Syngman Rhee also instructed his special agents on Jeju Island to cooperate and ordered the island's residents to prepare to "assist."

These individuals concluded that Kuomintang special agents are now intensifying this plan. If the U.S. continues to adopt a conniving attitude, even if Kuomintang special agents do not have time to realize their plan before the armistice, they will launch various sabotage actions after the armistice, when the prisoners of war are handed over to neutral nations, or while they are under the custody of neutral nations, or when representatives from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army explain to the prisoners of war.

    揭露蒋、李匪帮企图扣留志愿军战俘的阴谋
    【新华社广州二十七日电】香港“新晚报”二十七日下午出版的第三次版以头条地位刊载该报“特讯”，揭露台湾国民党残余匪帮正与南朝鲜李承晚匪帮勾结，企图破坏停战，强迫扣留不直接遣返的一万四千多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。新晚报的消息说：据最近自台湾抵港的人士今日透露：国民党特务现正在被囚于济州岛的不直接遣返的中国战俘中，加紧制造新的事件，企图破坏朝鲜停战。
    据此等人士称，在济州岛第三战俘营中，有不直接遣返的中国志愿军被俘人员一万四千多人。这些战俘应于停战后交给中立国看管。最近，鉴于停战协定签字期近，国民党特务正加紧活动，制造战俘反对移交、要求“就地释放”并送往台湾的事件，并准备强迫这些战俘从特务们挖好的地道和墙洞中冲出战俘营。国民党特务正以美军翻译员的名义在济州岛战俘营活动，有名为杜广泰者即为其中之一。
    此等人士又称，国民党在美军协助下在巨济岛战俘营中安置特务约始于一九五一年七月。当时，国民党特务王顺清、李大安等经美军在东京加以特务训练后回到巨济岛，就在战俘营中建立特务组织。从一九五二年四月起，美军在国民党特务的协助下进行“甄别”，用不给饭吃，强迫刺字和写血书，当场毒打和杀头、剖腹等办法，胁迫战俘“反对遣返”。
    此等人士指出，在六月上旬板门店谈判中关于战俘遣返问题达成协议前后，国民党就和李承晚合谋“释放”战俘。为了进行这一计划，国民党曾派了一名特务首脑陈建中前往南韩，和国民党驻南韩大使王东原一起策动，通过李承晚的亲信张锡润等共同布置。当李承晚下令“释放”两万七千名北朝鲜战俘后，国民党特务也就把在东莱（釜山附近）的中国战俘一百多名押走，并由在釜山的国民党特务伪装“侨领”接应，把其中五十多人分散隐藏在釜山，并由国民党驻南韩大使王东原予以接济。接着，国民党特务即进一步策动“释放”济州岛战俘，伪造战俘写血书给艾森豪威尔、李承晚、蒋介石，要求“就地释放”，“到台湾去”。同时，李承晚也布置他们在济州岛的特务进行策应，并命令岛上的居民准备“协助”。
    此等人士最后称，国民党特务现正加紧进行此项计划。如果美国方面继续采取纵容态度，国民党特务即使在停战前来不及实现他们的计划，也会在停战后战俘移交给中立国时，或在中立国看管时，或在朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军方面代表向战俘进行解释时，发动种种破坏行动。
