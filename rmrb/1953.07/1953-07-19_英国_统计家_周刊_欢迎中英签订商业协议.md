Xinhua News Agency, London, July 11th: The weekly "Statistician," in an editorial commenting on the commercial agreement reached by the British trade delegation of industrialists and businessmen visiting Beijing and the China National Import and Export Corporation, said that British industry should be delighted with this massive commercial agreement.

The magazine wrote: "A commercial agreement for 30 million pounds of imports and exports on each side is no small agreement." Britain will sell the goods that it needs to find new markets and new non-dollar customers for.

The editorial continued: "Although the British government feels it necessary to point out immediately that it is not responsible for this agreement, and that the strict embargo on many goods remains unchanged, business people, especially those in the Midlands, are very interested in the delegation's achievements."

    英国“统计家”周刊
    欢迎中英签订商业协议
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：“统计家”周刊在社论中评论前往北京的英国工商业贸易代表团与中国进出口公司谈定的商业协议说，英国工业理应为这个庞大的商业协议欢欣鼓舞。
    该杂志写道：“双方各进出口三千万英镑货物的商业协议不是一个小协议。”英国将卖出那些它需要为它找到新市场与新的非美元主顾的货物。
    社论继续说：“虽然英国政府认为有必要立刻指出它不为这个协议负责任，并指出许多货物的严格禁运现在仍然不变，但是企业界人士，尤其是密德兰的企业界人士对于代表团的成就有极浓厚的兴趣。”
