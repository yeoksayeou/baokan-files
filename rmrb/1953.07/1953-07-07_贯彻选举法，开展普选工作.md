Implement the Election Law, Carry Out Universal Suffrage

Xinhua News Agency: Two pilot townships in Linxia, Gansu, complete grassroots elections

Xinji and Gucheng, two pilot townships in Linxia County, Gansu Province, completed their grassroots elections and held their first township People's Congresses on June 20th and 21st respectively, electing township government members, a township head, a deputy township head, and representatives to the county People's Congress.

Voters of all ethnic groups in Xinji and Gucheng townships actively participated in the elections. In Gucheng Township, 89.9% of all voters, male and female, from all ethnic groups, cast their ballots. Xinji and Gucheng townships elected a total of 53 representatives to the township People's Congress. In the elections, both townships focused on ethnic unity, giving full consideration to the number of representatives from each ethnic group and social stratum. At the same time, attention was also paid to the quota of female representatives from all ethnic groups, with female representatives accounting for more than 20% of the total number of representatives in both townships.

Xinji and Gucheng townships were very serious about nominating candidates during the universal suffrage campaign, conducting thorough deliberation and discussion in advance. The candidates included outstanding cadres and activists from all ethnic groups who had emerged in various movements, hardworking women from all ethnic groups, as well as democratic figures and imams from the Islamic faith. At the same time, in conjunction with candidate nominations and the collection of proposals, voters of all ethnic groups were mobilized to seriously examine the work of the People's Government.

The universal suffrage work in these two townships was closely linked to production from beginning to end. All cadres participating in the universal suffrage campaign took the initiative to help farmers of all ethnic groups solve many difficulties in production. The election committees of the two townships led farmers in repairing irrigation canals, allowing more than 200 mu of wheat fields to be watered in time, and helped farmers rush to plant and replant more than 500 mu of summer and autumn fields, and helped key villages consolidate agricultural production mutual aid groups.

Chenliang Township in Guizhu County, Guizhou, with mixed ethnic groups, completes pilot work for grassroots elections

Chenliang Township, a township with mixed ethnic groups in Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, recently completed the pilot work for grassroots elections, making it the first township in the minority areas of Southwest China to complete universal suffrage.

The five electoral districts in the township held election meetings on June 20, 23, and 25. Voters from all ethnic groups actively participated in the election meetings, reaching 91.8% of the total number of voters. Voters of all ethnic groups wore clean clothes to the venue. Women of all ethnic groups also wore their traditional costumes to participate in the election meeting.

The township elected a total of 33 representatives from all ethnic groups according to the population ratio of each ethnic group, including 19 representatives from the Zhongjia ethnic group, 10 representatives from the Han ethnic group, and 4 representatives from the Miao ethnic group. All twelve villages in the township had their own representatives elected. Among the elected representatives, many are outstanding figures who are connected with the masses and loved by the masses. For example, Zhao Jiaxing, the head of Chenliang Township, is responsible in his daily work and has achieved remarkable results during his tenure. In the election, he received 407 votes, the most votes of any candidate in the Chenliang Township electoral district.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province hold election work conferences respectively

From early to mid-June, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province held election work conferences in Guihua City respectively.

The participants in the election work conference of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region included the heads of the Eastern Administrative Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the election committees of various leagues, banners, counties, and cities, and representatives of relevant agencies. The meeting focused on discussing various issues related to the implementation of the Election Law throughout the autonomous region.

The meeting believed that thanks to the autonomous region's correct implementation of the Party's ethnic policies, production movements and various social reform movements had been carried out in the past six years. People's representative conferences from all walks of life have been widely convened in various parts of the autonomous region, and people's representative conferences from all walks of life in some areas have exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses. People of all ethnic groups and all walks of life have been trained in democratic life and have gained election experience. These circumstances show that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is fully equipped to implement universal suffrage. Based on the specific conditions of the Inner Mongolia region and in accordance with the general spirit of the Election Law, the representatives determined the number of representatives to the people's congresses at all levels in the autonomous region on the basis of ethnic equality, friendship, and unity. In terms of timing, the steps of grassroots election work in agricultural and pastoral areas were determined according to the different production seasons in agricultural and pastoral areas.

In addition, the meeting also decided to further promote regional autonomy for other ethnic minorities within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region through universal suffrage.

The election work conference of Suiyuan Province, based on the spirit of the Election Law, conducted detailed and in-depth research on how to conduct universal suffrage work in light of the specific conditions of the province, which is characterized by mixed ethnic groups, vast areas, and scattered populations. Representatives of the Ulanqab League Autonomous Region and the Ik Zhao League Autonomous Region, based on the living conditions and population ratios of the Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups in each banner, repeatedly discussed the proportion of representatives for the entire league and each banner. The meeting also made supplementary regulations for carrying out universal suffrage work in the province.

Fushun City establishes a "notification system for investigating and registering out-of-town populations"

In its population investigation and registration work, Fushun City has established a "notification system for investigating and registering out-of-town populations" to prevent duplication or omission in registering out-of-town and permanent residents.

Before the population investigation and registration, the Fushun City Election Committee estimated that the mobility of the urban population was relatively high. For example, some workers and staff members sometimes lived at their workplaces and sometimes lived at home; some citizens lived in two places, and there was often population movement between the two places; and some elderly people were supported by their children in rotation and did not have a fixed address. These situations could easily lead to duplication or omission when registering out-of-town and permanent residents. Therefore, the City Election Committee proposed the implementation of a "notification system for investigating and registering out-of-town populations." When a registration station registers an "out-of-town population," it issues a notification to the registration station in the current residential area of the person being notified, stating that the station has registered him as an "out-of-town population," allowing the other station to register him as a "permanent resident." After this method proved to be practical in the pilot project of population investigation and registration, it began to be widely promoted throughout the city in mid-June. Every day, the district election committees took the notifications collected by each registration station to the office of the city election committee for exchange, and then distributed the exchanged notifications to each registration station. After receiving the notification, each registration station no longer spent time checking and could register the person being notified as a "permanent resident."

According to the experience of Fushun City, to implement the "notification system for investigating and registering out-of-town populations," the current address of the person being notified must be filled out clearly, otherwise, the notification cannot be transmitted. When the city first implemented this method, it wasted time due to the incomplete filling of the notification, which was later corrected.

Voters in Guancang Township, Jintang County, Sichuan, carefully examine representative candidates

Voters in Guancang Township, Jintang County, Sichuan Province, carefully examined the representative candidates, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

After completing the population investigation and voter registration work, Guancang Township began the nomination of representative candidates. Many township and village cadres made work summary reports and self-criticisms to the representatives at the township people's representative meetings or voter representative meetings. The representatives then communicated these reports to the broad masses of voters for their examination. Through this examination, many original village cadres who were loved by the masses were nominated as candidates. Liu Tongxing, the water conservancy committee member of the 13th village, has always been active in his work. Last year, he led the village in digging ponds and weirs, solving the water shortage problem for more than 70 mu of paddy fields in the village. Once, when the river flooded, more than 200 mu of fields in the village were submerged. He actively led the masses to dredge the ditches, saving half of the disaster-stricken fields from disaster. The masses said: We must vote for such a person who can do things for us. Some cadres with shortcomings, after making self-criticisms, were also nominated by the voters to the list of representative candidates. Li Shaoan, the village head of the 14th village, examined his shortcomings in forcing the masses to organize mutual aid groups, reorganized the four mutual aid groups that had been dissolved according to the principle of voluntariness, and took the lead in clearing work and settling accounts. Based on his consistent active work in the past and his willingness to correct shortcomings, the voters unanimously nominated him as a representative candidate. In addition, many new figures who emerged from the masses were also nominated as representatives this time. For example, Lin Dezhen, a member of the women's mutual aid group in the 7th village who actively helped others overcome production difficulties, and Lin Weixuan, a militia member who conscientiously protected the interests of the masses, were loved by the people of the whole village. In the final approved list of candidates, the original cadres accounted for 87%.

Twelve electoral districts in Changshan Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, elect township people's representatives

The twelve electoral districts in Changshan Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, have elected township people's representatives. During the few days from June 23rd to 27th, the villages in each electoral district were shrouded in a festive atmosphere. At dawn, the voters dressed neatly and flocked to the solemn and simple venue with their voter certificates. In the days before the election, most voter groups in each electoral district repeatedly discussed the glory and solemnity of the right to vote in a casual manner. The women in many villages automatically cleaned the roads in front of and behind the villages, and each electoral district mobilized young people under the age of 18 to take turns on sentry duty and take care of children. People attached such importance to their democratic rights that 95.6% of the total number of voters in the township participated in the election meeting and cast their votes. Yuan Caijin, a 78-year-old woman in the Tangjiabu electoral district, led her family of three generations and seven people into the venue and said to everyone she met: "This is a great event that has never happened before. The working people can elect their own heads of the family!"

Through the election, a total of 48 township people's representatives were elected in the township, including 14 women. These representatives had been fully discussed by each voter group in advance, and they were all outstanding model figures. When discussing representative candidates, the Lin Zhanggen voter group in Houshan Natural Village, Qianshan electoral district, first put forward four conditions as the criteria for selection. These four conditions were: firm stance, selfless, active work, and able to connect with the masses. They said: Representatives are the heads of the family, and we must be especially cautious when selecting representatives. When Hua Youxian, a young woman loved by the masses in this electoral district, was nominated at the election meeting, the entire audience raised their hands. The voters said that she was good at production, good at learning, good at work, and not afraid of difficulties. She actively publicized and played a leading role in any work and should be elected.

Yang Zhengshun, a young farmer in Shangxintiao electoral district who received the most votes, won the title of model four times in the three years from 1950 to 1952. In the winter of 1951, he led the villagers in repairing the embankment, actively took responsibility, patrolled the embankment back and forth in the middle of the night, and when the flood broke through the embankment, he twice took the lead in jumping into the water to plug the loopholes. For the sake of everyone's interests, he never considered personal gains or losses. When the voter group discussed him as a representative candidate, they all said: This is our good representative. Everyone voted for him at the election meeting.

The election meetings in each electoral district fully demonstrated an atmosphere of unity. The voters expressed their full love and trust in the representatives they elected. Lin Zhicheng, a voter in the Qianshan electoral district, spoke his mind on behalf of all the voters at the election meeting. He said: "We elected the people we love the most as representatives, and we must support them. We have handed over our rights to the representatives, and we require them to be selfless, deeply connect with the masses, and bring the opinions of the people to the township people's congress for discussion, and further lead us to do a good job in production." The cadres of each village also expressed their willingness to unite well with the representatives, strengthen contact, lead the masses, and do a good job. The elected township people's representatives all felt very honored. At the election meeting, Hua Xiangqing, a people's representative, said excitedly: "We must not forget everyone's expectations of the people's representatives, we must connect with the masses and cadres, not be afraid of difficulties, and faithfully serve the masses." After the election meeting, these 48 representatives, including farmers, small handicraftsmen, women, and elementary school teachers, are fulfilling their promises, going deep into the voter groups, soliciting opinions from the masses, and preparing to participate in the first township people's congress.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    甘肃临夏两个试办乡完成基层选举工作
    甘肃省临夏县新集、古城两个基层选举典型试办乡已在六月二十日和二十一日分别举行了第一次乡人民代表大会，选出了乡人民政府委员、乡长、副乡长和出席县人民代表大会的代表。
    新集、古城两乡的各族选民都踊跃参加了选举，古城乡参加投票的各族男女选民占全乡选民总数的百分之八十九点九。新集、古城两乡共选出五十三名乡人民代表大会的代表。两个乡在选举中都注意从民族团结出发，充分照顾到各民族和各阶层的代表人数。同时，还注意了各族妇女代表的名额，两个乡妇女代表的名额都占到全乡代表总数的百分之二十以上。
    新集、古城两乡在普选中对候选人的提名很认真，事先都经过充分酝酿讨论，候选人中有在各种运动中涌现的各族优秀干部和积极分子，有勤劳生产的各族妇女，还有各族中的民主人士和伊斯兰教的阿訇。同时，结合候选人提名和搜集提案等工作，发动各族选民认真检查了人民政府工作。
    这两个乡的普选工作从始到终都紧密结合着生产进行。所有参加普选工作的干部，主动地帮助各族农民解决了许多生产上的困难问题。这两个乡选举委员会在普选中领导农民整修水渠，使二百多亩麦田及时放上了水，并帮助农民抢种和补种了五百亩以上的夏田和秋田，帮助各村重点整顿了农业生产互助组。
    贵州贵筑县民族杂居的陈亮乡完成基层选举试办工作
    贵州省贵筑县民族杂居乡陈亮乡已在最近完成基层选举试办工作，这是西南区少数民族地区较早完成普选工作的第一个乡镇。
    该乡五个选区分别在六月二十、二十三、二十五日三天召开选举大会。各民族的选民踊跃参加选举大会，达到选民总数的百分之九十一点八。各族选民都穿上整洁的衣服赶到会场。各族妇女也都穿上本民族的盛装，参加选举大会。
    全乡按照各民族的人口比例共选出各民族的代表三十三人，计仲家族代表十九人，汉族代表十人，和苗族代表四人。全乡十二个村寨都有自己的代表当选。在选出的代表中，许多是联系群众为群众爱戴的优秀人物。如陈亮乡乡长赵家兴，平日工作负责，任职期间成绩显著，在选举中，获得四百零七票，是陈亮乡选区获票最多的候选人。
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省分别举行选举工作会议
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省自六月初旬到中旬，分别在归绥市举行选举工作会议。
    出席内蒙古自治区选举工作会议的有内蒙古自治区东部区行政公署及各盟、旗、县、市选举委员会负责人和有关机关代表。会议集中讨论了在全自治区贯彻选举法的各项问题。
    会议认为由于自治区正确贯彻了党的民族政策，六年来进行了生产运动和各种社会改革运动。自治区各地曾普遍召开了各界人民代表会议，部分地区的各界人民代表会议代行了人民代表大会的职权。各族各界人民受到民主生活的锻炼，已经有了选举经验。这些情况说明内蒙古自治区完全具备实行普选的条件。代表们根据内蒙古地区的具体情况，按照选举法的总精神，在民族平等、友爱、团结的基础上确定了自治区各级人民代表大会的代表名额。在时间上，按照农业区和牧业区的不同生产季节，确定了农、牧区的基层选举工作步骤。
    此外会议还决定通过普选进一步推行内蒙古自治区境内其他少数民族的区域自治工作。
    绥远省选举工作会议，根据选举法的精神，对全省民族杂居、地区辽阔、人口分散的具体情况如何进行普选工作，做了细致、深入的研究。乌兰察布盟自治区和伊克昭盟自治区的各旗代表，根据各旗蒙、汉等民族人民居住的情况和人口比例，对全盟和各旗的代表比例进行了反复讨论。会议还做出在本省进行普选工作的补充规定。
    抚顺市建立“在外人口调查登记通报”制度
    抚顺市在人口调查登记工作中，建立了“在外人口调查登记通报”制度，以防止在登记在外人口和常住人口时发生重复或遗漏现象。
    抚顺市选举委员会在人口调查登记前，估计到城市人口流动性较大，如有的工人和职员有时在工作地点住，有时回家住；还有的市民一家人分住两处，而两处人口又常有流动；还有些老年人，受子、女轮流供养，没有固定住址等等。这些情况，在登记在外与常住人口时，很容易发生重复或遗漏现象。因此市选举委员会研究提出实行“在外人口调查登记通报”的制度。登记站登记了“在外人口”就发通报给被通报人现住区的登记站，说明本站已将他登记为“在外人口”，让对方站登记为“常住人口”。这一办法在人口调查登记的典型试办中证明切实可行后，六月中旬已开始在全市普遍推行。每天，各区选举委员会把由各登记站集中起来的通报，拿到市选举委员会办公室进行交换，然后再将交换来的通报，分发到各登记站去。各登记站接到通报后，即可不再多费时间查对，将被通报人登记为“常住人口”。
    根据抚顺市的经验，实行“在外人口调查登记通报”的办法，必须将被通报人的现在住址填写清楚，否则无法传递通报。该市在开始实行这一办法时就因通报填写不详细而浪费了时间，随后才改正过来。
    四川金堂县官仓乡选民认真审查代表候选人
    四川省金堂县官仓乡选民认真审查代表候选人，进一步密切了干部与群众的关系。
    官仓乡完成人口调查和选民登记工作后，就开始代表候选人的提名。许多乡、村干部都在乡人民代表会议或选民代表会上，向代表们作了工作总结报告和自我检查。代表们并把这些报告分别传达到广大选民中去，让选民们审查。通过这次审查，很多为群众爱戴的原有乡村干部，都被提名为候选人。十三村水利委员刘同兴，工作一贯积极，去年领导全村挖塘堰，解决了村里七十多亩水田的缺水问题；有一次河水暴涨，村里有二百多亩田被淹没，他又积极领导群众疏通水沟，使二分之一的受灾田免于灾害。群众说：这样能为我们办事的人一定要投他的票。有些有缺点的干部，经过检讨后，选民们也把他们提到代表候选人的名单中。十四村村长黎少安，检查了自己强迫群众组织互助组的缺点，把已经解散的四个互助组重新按自愿原则整理起来，并带头清工结账。选民们根据他过去工作一贯积极和勇于改正缺点的精神，一致提出他为代表候选人。另外许多从群众中涌现出来的新人物，这次也被提名为代表候选人。如第七村积极帮助别人克服生产困难的妇女互助组员林德贞、认真保护群众利益的民兵林维宣等，都受到了全村人民的爱戴。在最后审定的候选人名单中，原有的干部即占百分之八十七。
    浙江省富阳县长山乡十二个选区选出乡人民代表
    浙江省富阳县长山乡十二个选区已分别选出乡人民代表。六月二十三日到二十七日的几天中，各个选区的村庄都笼罩着节日的气氛。天刚黎明，选民们就穿戴得整整齐齐，拿着选民证涌向装饰得又庄严又朴素的会场。在选举的前几天，各选区大部分选民小组采取了漫谈的方式反复讨论了选举权利的光荣和庄严性。许多村庄的妇女自动地把村前村后的大小道路打扫得干干净净，各选区还动员了十八岁以下的青年轮流放哨和带孩子。人们是这样重视自己的民主权利，全乡参加选举大会投了票的选民占选民总人数百分之九十五点六。汤家埠选区七十八岁的老婆婆袁彩金，领着全家子孙三代七口人走进会场时逢人就说：“这是从来没有过的大喜事，劳动人民可以自己选当家人了！”
    经过选举，全乡共选出乡人民代表四十八名，其中妇女十四名。这些代表在事前都经过各选民小组充分地讨论，他们都是一些优秀的模范人物。前山选区的后山自然村林章根选民小组，在讨论代表候选人时先提出了四个条件作为选择的标准。这四个条件是立场坚定、大公无私、工作积极、能够联系群众。他们说：代表是当家人，选代表要特别慎重。当这个选区为群众爱戴的青年妇女华友仙在选举大会上被提名时，全场都举起了手。选民们都说她生产好，学习好，工作好，不怕困难，在任何工作中都积极宣传，起带头作用，应该选她。
    上新眺选区获得票数最多的青年农民杨正顺，在一九五零年到一九五二年三年中，先后四次获得了模范的称号。一九五一年冬，他领导全村群众参加修堤，积极负责，半夜里在堤上来回巡查，大水冲破了堤防时，他两次带头跳进水里堵住漏洞。为了大家的利益，他从不考虑个人得失。选民小组在讨论他当代表候选人时，都说：这是我们的好代表。在选举大会上大家都投票选了他。
    各选区的选举大会上都充分显示了团结的气氛。选民们对自己选举出来的代表表示充分地爱戴和信任。前山选区选民林志诚在选举大会上代表全体选民说出了心里的话，他说：“我们选举了自己最爱戴的人当代表，就一定要拥护他。我们把权利交给了代表，就要求他们大公无私，深入联系群众，把人民的意见带到乡人民代表大会上去讨论，进一步领导我们搞好生产。”各个村的干部也都表示要和代表们很好团结，加强联系，带动群众，做好工作。被选举出来的乡人民代表都感到非常光荣。在选举会上，人民代表华祥庆激动的说：“我们一定不忘记大家对人民代表的希望，一定要联系群众和干部，不怕困难，忠实地为群众办事。”选举大会开过后，这些包括农民、小手工业者、妇女和小学教师的四十八名代表，正履行他们的诺言，深入选民小组，征求群众意见，准备参加第一届乡人民代表大会。
