The supply of production materials in Laiyang Special District, Shandong Province, this spring was carried out amid the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, through summarizing and inspecting work, exposing shortcomings and errors in past work, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and commending good people and good deeds. This year's material supply work not only promptly supplied farmers with a large number of production materials, directly promoting spring plowing, but also greatly changed the past erroneous practices of forced orders, administrative allocation, and "waiting for customers to come," further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, and improving the work of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the district. From January to April 20th, the entire district supplied farmers with a total of 9.23 million jin of chemical fertilizer, 1,922 walking plows, 547 waterwheels, over 14.15 million jin of cake fertilizer, 5.2 million jin of miscellaneous fertilizer, over 4,800 pieces of various small farm tools, 1.98 million jin of cotton seeds, 1.29 million jin of peanut cake, and 3,223 head of livestock purchased from other areas; in addition, a batch of pesticides and spraying equipment was also supplied. Except for a few materials whose supply was slightly reduced due to not being suitable for local conditions, the rest greatly exceeded the quantity supplied in the same period last year. For example, chemical fertilizer exceeded by 80 percent, and walking plows exceeded by 127 percent. Due to the strengthening of technical guidance, not only were the above materials directly used in spring plowing, but also waterwheels and walking plows that had been forcibly allocated to farmers over the years but had not been used were brought into play.

Laiyang Special District has gained the following experiences in this spring's material supply work:

First, Party committees at all levels strengthened ideological and policy leadership over supply and marketing cooperatives, and systematically conducted ideological education for supply and marketing cooperative cadres on "serving the agricultural production process"; at the same time, the entire Party was educated to regard doing a good job in material supply as an important step in leading agricultural production. When studying and arranging spring plowing work this year, the Laiyang Prefectural Party Committee specifically helped the Laiyang Special District Cooperative Branch organize cadres from cooperative societies in various counties to conduct focused inspections of last year's material supply work, and paid attention to collecting good and bad typical cases, and then convened a meeting of county cooperative directors and managers to carefully inspect and summarize last year's production material supply work, criticizing and exposing from the bottom up the shortcomings and errors in the supply work of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, and finding the root causes of the problems; the meeting also introduced the typical experiences of Zhaoyuan County in promoting new-style walking plows, where leading cadres took the lead in learning the technology and going deep into the fields to teach farmers how to use new farm tools, and of Pingdu County Zhanjia Township cadres in implementing the mass line to promote chemical fertilizers, specifically conducting ideological education for cadres on "cooperatives serving the agricultural production process." On the basis of improving cadres' understanding, the material supply work for this spring was discussed and arranged in a relatively practical manner, and policies and specific methods were explained. After the meeting, all counties convened meetings of directors and team leaders of grassroots cooperatives to implement the spirit of the meeting. After that, cadres were organized to study the instructions of the CPC Central Committee to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production, and the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." Through study and comparison of examples, the phenomenon of disconnection between cooperative supply and marketing work and production was further criticized, and it was clarified that doing a good job in material supply must be combined with mobilizing the masses and carrying out technical guidance, correcting the erroneous view of some cadres in the past that "mobilizing the masses to help farmers plan production is a matter for the Party committee, and material supply is a matter for the cooperative," and improving the enthusiasm of cooperative cadres to learn technology and production knowledge. Therefore, cooperative cadres generally believed that: this year's work arrangements from higher levels were clear in terms of principles, clear in policy boundaries, and specific in methods; they knew how to do things right and how to do things wrong.

In view of the serious mistakes of commandism and lack of technical guidance in last year's material supply work, which caused adverse effects among farmers, Party committees at all levels, after mobilizing and arranging spring plowing work, convened meetings of member representatives and township people's representatives with grassroots cooperatives as units, where relevant cadres made public self-criticisms to farmers; and guaranteed to the masses that the purchase of production materials was completely voluntary, not forcibly allocated, and were responsible for teaching how to use them, and that if there were problems with the farm tools themselves, they could be returned or replaced. For the walking plows and waterwheels that were forcibly allocated last year, measures were taken to ensure that those who could use them would be taught how to use them, those who needed repair would be responsible for repairing them, those who were not suitable would be replaced, and those who did not purchase voluntarily or had no conditions for use would be taken back and refunded, respectively. After the meeting, they started with teaching technology and handling outstanding cases, and carried out the promotion of new-style farm tools and other material supply work. Farmers responded well to this approach. Some farmers said: "It's not that the walking plow is not easy to use, but that we haven't learned how to use it." In the Jiangshan and Zekou districts of Laiyang County, which lacked the conditions for using waterwheels, the cooperative recovered 112 of the 157 waterwheels allocated last year, reversing the adverse effects.

Second, when supplying production materials, the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy were taken into account, and work was carried out according to local conditions and the actual needs of farmers, overcoming blindness and subjectivism. The reason why serious mistakes were made in last year's material supply work was mainly because the leaders did not proceed from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, and were eager for quick success and instant benefits, blindly promoting new-style walking plows, waterwheels, chemical fertilizers, and gas pumping machines; but they believed that the small farm tools needed by ordinary farmers were backward "toys," with many varieties and troublesome, and were unwilling to actively manage and supply them. As a result, many of the waterwheels and walking plows promoted could not be used, but the supply of small farm tools could not meet the needs of farmers. This year, attention was paid to this point in the material supply work, and the actual needs of farmers were met. Some areas lacked soybean cake, fertilizer, and livestock feed, and the problem could not be solved, and farmers were not accustomed to using chemical fertilizers. Cooperative cadres went deep into reality and discussed solutions to these problems with farmers, on the one hand, carrying out technical guidance and persuading farmers to use chemical fertilizers; on the other hand, purchasing cotton seeds and red hemp seeds scattered in the hands of farmers, and processing them into fertilizers; and mobilizing the masses to switch to using red sorghum, sweet potato dried, and peanut cake as livestock feed. This overcame the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer and livestock feed. In order to solve the problem of insufficient funds when adding production materials, some cooperatives appropriately reduced the scope of supply of living materials, and classified the department stores they currently operated into necessities and non-urgent items, appropriately reducing non-urgent items (at least 20 to 30 kinds, and up to hundreds of kinds), so that they could more centrally use funds to operate production materials urgently needed by farmers. When farmers in Liaolan County were digging wells, they urgently needed down-well tools, but a set of down-well tools cost nearly 2 million yuan, which farmers could not afford; even if they could afford it, they could not use it regularly. The cooperative withdrew a certain amount of funds to purchase down-well tools, and adopted a leasing method to supply farmers, solving this problem.

Third, the supply of production materials is combined with in-depth publicity and technical guidance in the fields. This is to use examples to carry out general publicity and education to farmers, cadres learn technology, go deep into the fields, teach technology to farmers, and earnestly correct the shortcomings of empty slogans of technical guidance in the past. After Dong Zidan, director of the Laixi County United Cooperative, learned the technology of using the new-style walking plow, he personally went to the Yuanshang Liancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative to provide technical guidance, promoting six grassroots cooperative cadres to learn the technology, and within more than a month, educating 90 farmers to learn how to use the walking plow. This method of combining example publicity and technical guidance, combining cadres and the masses, not only enabled the material supply work to truly serve production, but also changed the working style of cadres. When promoting new-style walking plows, it was generally proposed to: "Guarantee teaching, guarantee learning, and guarantee repair" and "Teach first, then sell, and do not sell if you don't know how to use it"; when promoting chemical fertilizers, it was proposed to: "Do not sell if the ideology is not clear, do not sell if there are no water conservancy conditions, and do not sell if you haven't taught the technology." Many cadres have demonstrated a spirit of responsibility to the end for farmers in technical guidance, overcoming the difficulty of not understanding technology. The work group of the Laiyang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Branch repeatedly tested the new-style walking plow in Fengtai Township, Pingdu County, and all failed. However, the comrades of the work group were not discouraged, and finally found the problems of the new-style walking plow, and corrected all these problems. In this way, the farmers in the township truly believed in the effectiveness of the new-style walking plow and learned the technology of using it, not only making the original 31 walking plows play a role in spring plowing production, but also selling two new-style walking plows. When promoting chemical fertilizers, the experience of local farmers in using chemical fertilizers to obtain bumper harvests in the past was first summarized, and methods such as visiting experienced old farmers, personally cultivating typical examples to make a model, and then organizing farmers to visit were adopted to popularize and promote it.

Fourth, the working method of creating base points and promoting the overall situation is universally applied. At the beginning of spring plowing, the Laiyang Prefectural Party Committee instructed the Party group of the Special District Cooperative Branch to draw out a certain number of cadres to set up base-point societies and cooperative branches. In order to implement this instruction, six section chiefs and 22 cadres were drawn out to form three work groups, which went to Laixi, Pingdu, and Laiyang counties to create typical experiences in production material supply work, and draw lessons from the base points to guide the overall situation. Cooperatives at all levels have drawn a large number of forces to participate in the base-point work of the county party committees and district party committees. There were 1,101 cooperative cadres in the whole district participating in base points, going to the countryside to inspect work, and dispersing in the countryside to teach technology, with a total of 236 base points. Cadres who went to the countryside were all working under the unified leadership of the local party committee. The cadres participating in the base-point work focused on the central work, and developed supply and marketing business by starting with the concrete help to farmers in production according to the needs of production. When the Party Committee put forward the task of hoeing wheat and topdressing, the cooperative's base-point work cadres combined it with the promotion of chemical fertilizers; when spring plowing was the focus, they generally went deep into checking the situation of farmers using new-style walking plows and promoting walking plows; when the Party Committee put forward the task of drought prevention and drought resistance, they combined it with the promotion of waterwheels. When farmers had difficulties in purchasing farm tools and chemical fertilizers, the bank provided loan support. Carrying out material supply work in this way made the material supply work truly serve the production process and promoted the smooth progress of the central work. Therefore, the cooperative cadres generally felt that: "This year's work has a base point, everything goes one step ahead, creating experience, having a model, and the work is easy to do."

    山东莱阳专区供应农民生产资料工作的经验
    中共莱阳地委
    山东莱阳专区今年春季的生产资料供应工作，是在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争中，通过总结检查工作，揭发过去工作中的缺点、错误，开展批评与自我批评，表扬好人好事的情况下进行的。今年的物资供应工作不仅及时地给农民供应了大批生产资料，直接推动了春耕生产，而且也大大地改变了过去供应工作中的强迫命令、行政摊派以及“等客上门”等错误作风，进一步密切了党与群众的联系，使全区各级供销合作社的工作提高了一步。全区从一月份到四月二十日止，供应到农民手里的化学肥料共有九百二十三万斤、步犁一千九百二十二部、水车五百四十七部、饼肥一千四百十五万余斤、杂肥五百二十万斤、各种小农具四千八百余件、棉籽一百九十八万斤、花生饼一百二十九万斤，以及从外地买入的牲口三千二百二十三头；此外，还供应了一批农药和药械。上述生产资料，除个别物资因不适合地区情况，供应量稍有减少外，其余都大大超过了去年同期供应的数量。如化学肥料超过了百分之八十，步犁超过了百分之一百二十七。由于加强了技术指导，不仅使上述物资能直接用于春耕生产，而且还使历年来强迫摊派到农民手里未能使用的水车、步犁发挥了作用。
    莱阳专区在今年春季的物资供应工作中，取得了如下几点经验。
    第一、各级党委加强了对供销合作社的思想领导与政策领导，有计划地对供销合作社干部进行了“为农业生产过程服务”的思想教育；同时教育全党把作好物资供应工作看成是领导农业生产的重要步骤。中共莱阳地委今年研究布置春耕生产工作时，具体地帮助莱阳专区合作分社，组织各县合作社的干部，有重点地深入检查了去年的物资供应工作，并注意搜集了好坏典型事例，然后召开县社主任、经理会议，认真地检查总结了去年的生产资料供应工作，由下而上地批评和揭发了各级供销合作社供应工作中存在的缺点与错误，并找出了问题的症结所在；会上还介绍了招远县在推广新式步犁时，领导干部带头学会技术，深入田间，教导农民使用新农具，和平度县战家乡干部贯彻群众路线推广化学肥料的典型经验，向干部具体地进行“合作社为农业生产过程服务”的思想教育。在提高干部认识的基础上，比较实际地讨论并布置了今春的物资供应工作，交代了政策与具体作法。会后，各县都召开了基层合作社主任、组长会议，贯彻这次会议的精神。此后，又组织干部学习了中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示，及人民日报“领导农业生产的关键所在”的社论。通过学习与实例对比，进一步批判了合作社供销工作与生产脱节的现象，明确了搞好物资供应工作必须和发动群众、进行技术指导相结合，纠正了过去某些干部认为“发动群众帮助农民打谱生产是党委的事，物资供应是合作社的事”的错误看法，并提高了合作社干部学习技术与生产知识的积极性。因此，合作社干部普遍认为：今年上级布置工作是方针明确、政策界限清楚、办法具体；知道怎样作对，怎样作不对。
    各级党委鉴于去年在物资供应工作中犯了严重的命令主义和缺乏技术指导的缺点和错误，在农民中造成了不良的影响，因此，在动员布置春耕工作之后，就以基层合作社为单位，召开了社员代表会议和乡人民代表会议，由有关干部向农民进行公开的检讨；并向群众保证购买者生产资料完全自愿，不强行摊派，负责教会使用方法，农具本身有毛病可以退回或更换。对去年强行摊派的步犁、水车，采取能使用者保证教会使用，须修理者负责修理，不适用者另换，非自愿购买或无使用条件者收回、退款等办法，分别进行处理。会后就从教技术和处理悬案入手，开展推广新式农具和其他物资供应工作。农民对于这种作法反映良好。有的农民说：
    “不是步犁不好使，而是咱没有学会使。”莱阳县姜山、泽口两区缺少使用水车的条件，合作社就把去年摊派的一百五十七部水车收回了一百一十二部，挽回了不良的影响。
    第二、在供应生产资料时，照顾小农经济的特点，根据地区条件和农民的实际需要进行工作，克服了盲目性和主观主义的作法。去年在物资供应工作上所以犯了严重的错误，主要是因为领导方面不从小农经济特点出发，好大喜功，盲目地推广新式步犁、水车、化学肥料、瓦斯抽水机；而对一般农民所需要的小农具，却认为是落后的“玩艺”，样数多，麻烦，不愿积极经营供应。结果推广的水车和步犁多不能应用，小农具的供应却不能满足农民的需要。今年在物资供应工作中注意了这一点，就满足了农民的实际需要。有些地区缺乏豆饼，肥料和牲畜饲料的问题无法解决，而农民又没有使用化学肥料的习惯。合作社干部就深入实际，和农民商量解决这些问题，一方面进行技术指导，劝说农民使用化学肥料；一方面收购散存在农民手中的棉籽、红麻籽，加工成为肥料；并动员群众改用红粮、地瓜干及花生饼作牲畜饲料。这就克服了肥料和牲畜饲料不足的困难。为了解决增添生产资料时资金不足的问题，有些合作社适当地缩小了生活资料供应的范围，把现在经营的百货加以排队，分为必需品和非急需品两类，适当地缩减非急需品（最少的减去二、三十种，多的减去百十种），这就能比较集中地把资金使用到经营农民所迫切需要的生产资料中去。蓼兰县农民打井时，迫切需用下泉工具，但一套下泉工具将近二百万元，农民买不起；即使买得起，也不能经常使用。合作社抽出一定数量的资金，购置了下泉工具，采取租赁办法供给农民使用，解决了这个问题。
    第三、供应生产资料和深入宣传、深入田间加强技术指导相结合。这就是运用实例向农民进行一般的宣传教育，干部学会技术，深入田间，向农民传授技术，切实纠正过去空喊技术指导的缺点。莱西县联合社主任董子丹学会使用新式步犁的技术后，亲自到院上联村供销合作社进行技术指导，推动六名基层合作社干部学会了技术，并在一个多月时间内，教育九十个农民学会使用步犁。这种实例宣传和技术指导相结合、干部和群众相结合的方法，不仅使物资供应工作能真正为生产服务，并且转变了干部的工作作风。在推广新式步犁时，各地普遍提出：“保教、保会，保修理”和“先教后卖，不会使用不卖”的口号；在推销化学肥料时提出：“思想不通不卖，没有水利条件不卖，未教会技术不卖”的口号。许多干部在技术指导上，都发挥了对农民负责到底的精神，克服了不懂技术的困难。莱阳专区供销合作社分社工作组在平度县凤台乡多次试验新式步犁，都失败了。但工作组的同志并不灰心，终于找出了新式步犁的毛病，并把这些毛病都改正了。这样，就使该乡的农民真正相信了新式步犁的效能，学会了使用的技术，不仅使原有的三十一部步犁在春耕生产中发挥了作用，同时又推销了两部新式步犁。在推广化学肥料时，首先总结当地农民过去使用化学肥料获得丰收的经验，采用访问有经验的老农，亲自培养典型作出样子再组织农民参观等方法，加以普及推广。
    第四、普遍地运用创设基点、推动全面的工作方法。春耕开始，莱阳地委就指示专区合作分社党组，抽出一定干部，设立基点社，合作分社。为了执行这一指示，抽出了六名科长、二十二名干部，组成三个工作组，分赴莱西、平度、莱阳三县，创造生产资料供应工作的典型经验，从基点中吸取经验指导全面。各级合作社都抽出大批力量，参加了县委和区委的基点工作。全区参加基点、下乡检查工作和分散在农村传授技术的合作社干部有一千一百零一人，共设基点二百三十六处。下乡干部都在当地党委统一领导下进行工作。参加基点工作的干部都以作中心工作为主，根据生产需要，从具体帮助农民搞生产入手去开展供销业务。在党委提出锄麦、追肥的任务时，合作社的基点工作干部就结合推广化学肥料；在以春耕为重点时，就普遍深入检查农民使用新式步犁的情况和推广步犁；在党委提出防旱抗旱时，就结合推广水车。农民购买农具、化学肥料有困难时，银行就进行贷款扶持。这样开展物资供应工作，使物资供应工作真正作到为生产过程服务，并促进了中心工作的顺利进行。因此，合作社干部普遍感觉到：“今年工作有了基点，事事先行一步，创造经验，有了样子，工作就好办了。”
