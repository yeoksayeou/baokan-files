Shandong University's Russian Professional Book Reading Crash Course Learning
Shandong University Russian Professional Book Reading Crash Course Teaching and Research Group

From January 26 to February 19, 1953 (with two and a half days of rest), our university held a Russian professional book reading crash course. A total of 153 people participated (mostly teachers from the university's College of Science). After twenty-two and a half days of study, the vast majority of students were able to master the basic Russian grammar and memorize more than 1,381 new words (the best students could memorize 1,846 new words, and the worst could memorize 581). The average total score for the first-stage grammar test was 88.2 points, and the average total score for the second-stage syntax test was 92.1 points. Now, the students have a preliminary reading ability.

Now we will write down our experience below:

Several Issues That Must Be Paid Attention to in Teaching

First, teachers must do a good job of preparation before teaching. Some teachers' Russian proficiency is not very high. However, because they prepared well and were able to use better teaching methods, they ensured the quality of classroom teaching. Some teachers have considerable professional skills, but because they did not prepare enough and failed to grasp the key points well, the effectiveness of classroom teaching was greatly affected. Therefore, we feel that in future crash course teaching, we must attach importance to the preparation stage. Before class, the lecturer must prepare well, try to conduct a trial lecture, and gradually improve the teaching content and teaching methods in the actual teaching process to ensure the teaching effect.

Second, pay attention to improving teaching methods.

一、Teachers must closely grasp the teaching objectives and requirements of each lesson when lecturing, the key points must be clear, the problems must be concentrated, and the examples must be simple and clear, without new words.

二、When teaching, we must pay attention to the purpose of crash course learning, which is to read professional Russian books, so we cannot teach everything. During the lectures, students often ask questions that deviate from the purpose of crash course learning, requiring teachers to answer them. Teachers can choose not to answer such questions.

三、Teachers must be good at using teaching aids: in the classroom, we must pay attention to the concentration of students' thoughts. The words on the blackboard should not be written too much or too messy, otherwise, it will distract the students' attention. Make full use of charts: charts are a good teaching aid that can clearly express complex grammar. For example, when explaining the changes in cases, use different colors to draw out the roots and endings of words, so that students can understand the rules of hard and soft correspondence at a glance, which is of great help in mastering the entire declension. However, too many charts should not be hung up, it is best to hang one up while lecturing, otherwise it will distract the students' attention.

四、In order to improve students' learning effectiveness, teaching methods must pay attention to diversity and flexibility. We used these methods in crash course teaching: mnemonic rhymes: after teaching a paragraph or a lesson, the teacher summarizes all the content. Some teachers compile the grammar points into five- or seven-character "rhymes" when explaining grammar and summarizing key points to facilitate students' memory. For example, when explaining the use of the six cases of nouns, they say: "The first case is the subject, the second is possessive, the third is indirect object, the fourth is direct object, the fifth case is instrument and method, and the sixth case (prepositional) must use OHaB." This not only makes it easier for students to remember, but also prevents students from being too nervous in class. Object teaching: teachers must fully estimate the students' difficulties before class, and disperse the difficulties of the problems during class. For example, students find it most difficult to understand perfective and imperfective aspects in grammar. Some teachers use a watch to calculate time as an example to help explain the changes in perfective and imperfective aspects, so that students quickly understand. Comparison method: teachers must be good at using the characteristics of students to help teaching. In our crash course, students generally understand English. When explaining grammar, use English to compare and explain the problem, the effect is very good. For example, compare the concept of case with the English Case, and compare the verbal adjective with the English Participle, which can deepen students' understanding of grammar.

Third, the teaching tasks of each stage should be clear, and the front and rear should be connected to each other. Although we proposed the central task of focusing on grammar in the first stage, the emphasis was not enough, resulting in focusing on vocabulary memorization in the first two days. It was only corrected after the leading comrades pointed it out. Although the tasks of each stage must be clearly stated, they must also be connected and linked to each other. For example, after explaining single words, you must spend a certain amount of time explaining syntax, so that students can read more smoothly after a large number of intensive vocabulary. This time we paid attention to the teaching of syntax and made it the central content of the first three days of the second stage. Therefore, students did not feel too much difficulty in analyzing sentences, which improved their reading ability. At the same time, when teaching single words in the first stage, we also paid attention to the connection with syntax, and told students simple syntax analysis symbols, which laid the foundation for syntax teaching.

Fourth, conduct regular checks and conduct regular tests. Usually, the counselors should regularly check the students' academic performance, and conduct tests at each stage to check the teaching effect and consolidate the students' learning confidence. The teaching and research group should pay attention to the preparation work before the test. When testing grammar, pay attention to the standards for grading; when testing reading speed, distinguish the scope of intensive reading and skimming; the final test should be longer. In addition, use various methods to consolidate vocabulary.

How to Conduct Tutoring Work

Tutoring is an indispensable part of Russian crash course teaching. In order to do a better job of tutoring, it is best to set up one organizer for each class (the organizer must have a certain political and professional level) to help solve the problems raised by individual students or counselors in a timely manner. Alternatively, the counselor team leader of each class does not concurrently work as a specific tutor for the student team, but concentrates on leading the work of the counselor team.

Counselors play a decisive role in tutoring. Therefore, counselors must be carefully selected. We feel that counselors should have the following conditions: a certain level of Russian; a correct understanding and full confidence in Russian crash course learning; a certain understanding of the characteristics of crash course learning and some basic links.

How do counselors carry out their work specifically?

First, they must be fully prepared for each day's course. Although they cannot be required to master the teaching materials as proficiently as teachers, they must strive to obtain the guidance of the lecturer before class; when listening to the class, they must pay attention to the main spirit of the teacher's lecture, and also pay attention to understanding the problems that students may encounter in the course, what is clear and what is not clear; what is easy to understand and what is not easy to understand. In this way, you can be targeted in tutoring.

Second, in tutoring, you must solve problems purposefully, inspire and help students to review on their own, so as to deepen their understanding of the course. Some counselors often repeat the key points subjectively, regardless of whether the students understand them or not, because they are not clear about the purpose of tutoring. Therefore, the effect is not great, and it affects the students' self-study time. The correct approach is: after class, give the students a certain amount of self-study time, let them raise questions first, and then the counselors will answer them individually or collectively.

Third, counselors must regularly understand and check all students in the group. The inspection does not have a fixed time and form, and the methods can be diverse. When checking classroom assignments, make a detailed understanding of each student and record the inspection results; especially for students who are "falling behind," remember more details.

How to help students who are "falling behind" in learning?

First, analyze the reasons for "falling behind," whether it is an ideological problem or a poor learning method. Then, focus on tutoring for the problems that occur. If it is a complex ideological problem, report to the organizer and work together to solve it; if it is a learning method problem, patiently help the students and ask them to change their learning methods, but do not be too hasty. Secondly, appropriately reduce their homework burden in learning. Provide special care for them in terms of learning conditions, and ensure that they have enough sleep time and a certain amount of extracurricular activity time every day.

Promotion of the Cyclic Memory Method

When memorizing new words at the beginning of the first stage, some students adopted the cyclic memory method. Students with better results could memorize about 80 new words per hour, and most students had poor results. Some students said: "Remember quickly, forget quickly." Some students have conservative ideas and are unwilling to use this method. The effect of using this method in the second stage was still not good. After a large number of intensive vocabulary memorization, various conservative ideas were criticized, and the effect was significantly improved. Students with good results could memorize 185 new words per hour, and generally could memorize 80 to 150 new words per hour. Memory efficiency has generally increased by more than doubled.

This shows that we have gone through a tortuous road in the process of using the cyclic memory method. The reasons are: first, everyone's understanding of the basic spirit and characteristics of the cyclic memory method is not enough. Some teachers still did not know the basic content of the cyclic memory method until the end. Because the teaching and research group failed to promote this new learning method well. After the second stage, the promotion work was carried out smoothly because the counselors further grasped the spirit of the cyclic memory method from actual learning. Second, the promotion was too early. In the first stage, students were not yet proficient in pronunciation and would not promote the work when analyzing new words, so the effect was not good. Third, because the students did not grasp the basic spirit of the cyclic memory method, the issue of the cycle period was not guaranteed organizationally. From the second half of the second stage, although a half-hour review time was stipulated every morning, students were not given sufficient review and inspection time at each stage.

In order to better promote the cyclic memory method, the teaching and research group must conduct mobilization before promotion. Teachers, counselors, and relevant staff must conduct serious study and experiments in order to master its spirit and characteristics. The cyclic period must be guaranteed organizationally, and a certain amount of time should be given for review and inspection every day, and sufficient time should be given for review at each stage.

    山东大学的俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习
    山东大学俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习班教研组
    自一九五三年一月二十六日至二月十九日（其中两天半是休息时间），我校举办了俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习班。参加人数共一百五十三人（大部分是我校理学院的教师）。经过二十二天半的学习，绝大部分的学员能掌握俄文的基本语法，记住生词一千三百八十一个以上（成绩最好的能记住生词一千八百四十六个，最差的能记住五百八十一个）。第一阶段文法测验总成绩平均为八十八点二分，第二阶段句法测验总成绩平均为九十二点一分。现在，学员都有了初步阅读能力。
    现在把我们的经验写在下面：
    教学中必须注意的几个问题
    第一，在教课以前教师必须做好课前的准备工作。有的教师虽然俄文水平不太高。但由于备课较好，加上能运用较好的教学方法，也就保证了课堂教学工作的质量。有的教师虽有相当业务水平，但由于备课不够充分，没有能很好地掌握重点，致使课堂教学效果受了很大影响。因此，我们感到在今后速成教学中，必须重视备课这一环，在上课以前，主讲教师必须好好备课，尽可能地进行试讲，并在实际教学过程中，逐渐改进教学内容和教学方法，以保证教学效果。
    第二，要注意改进教学方法。
    一、教师在讲课时必须紧紧掌握每课的教学目的和要求，重点要明确，问题要集中，举例时要选择简单、明了的，不要有生词。
    二、在讲授时必须注意速成学习的目的是阅读专业俄文书籍，因此，就不能什么都教。在讲授时学员往往会提出一些离开速成学习目的的问题，要求教师解答。对于这样的问题，教员可以不解答。
    三、教师必须善于利用教具：课堂中必须注意学员的思想集中，黑板字不宜写得太多，也不宜写得太乱，否则会分散学员的注意力。充分利用图表：图表是一种较好的教学辅助工具，它能够把复杂的文法清楚地表示出来。如在讲格的变化时，用不同的颜色把字根字尾画出来，学员一看就明白硬软对应的规律，对掌握整个变格有很大帮助。但图表不宜挂得太多，最好讲一张挂一张，否则会分散学员的注意力。
    四、为了提高学员的学习效果，教学方法必须注意多样性和灵活性。我们在速成教学中，利用了这些方法：口诀法：教员在讲授一段或一课后把全部内容总结一下，有的教员在讲文法、总结要领时，为了便于学员记忆，把文法要点编成五字或七字的 “顺口溜”。如讲名词六格用法时就说：“一格为主二为属，三为间接四为补，五格工具和方法，六格（前置）要用OHaB”。这样既使学员容易记忆，又可以使学员在课堂上的情绪不至太紧张。实物教学：教员在上课前必须充分估计到学员的困难，上课时应分散问题的难点。如文法中的完成体未完成体，学员最难理解，有的教员以用手表计算时间为例来帮助说明完成体和未完成体的变化，这样学员很快就明白了。比较法：教员必须善于利用学员的特点来帮助教学。在我们的速成学习班里面，学员一般是懂英文的，在讲文法时就用英文比较着来说明问题，效果很好。如在讲格的概念时和英文的Case（格）相比较，讲形动词时和英文的Participle（分词）相比较，这样可以加深学员对文法的理解。
    第三，各阶段的教学任务要明确，前后要互相联系。我们在第一阶段虽提出了以文法为主的中心任务，但由于强调得不够，结果在头两天偏重了生词记忆。经领导同志指出后才纠正。各阶段的任务虽然要提得明确，但也要互相联系、衔接。如在讲完单字以后，必须用一定的时间讲句法，这样学员在大量突击生词以后就能比较顺利地进行阅读。这次我们注意了句法的讲授，把它作为第二阶段前三天的中心内容，因此学员在分析句子时没有感到太大的困难，也就提高了他们的阅读能力。同时在第一阶段讲单字时也注意了和句法的联系，告诉学员简单的句法分析的记号，这就为句法讲授打下了基础。
    第四，经常进行检查，定期进行测验。平时辅导员对于学员的学习成绩要经常检查，每一阶段还要进行测验，检查教学效果，巩固学员的学习信心。教研组应该注意测验前的准备工作。在测验文法时，要注意成绩的评定标准；在测验阅读速度时，要把精读和略读的范围区别开来；最后的一次测验最好时间长一些。另外，要用各种方法巩固生词。
    怎样进行辅导工作
    辅导工作是俄文速成教学工作中不可缺少的一部分。为了把辅导工作做得更好，每班最好能设组织员一人（组织员须有一定的政治水平和业务水平），及时帮助解决个别学员或辅导员所提出的问题。或者，每班的辅导员小组长不兼学员小组的具体辅导工作，集中力量领导辅导员小组的工作。
    辅导员对辅导工作起着决定性的作用。因此，必须慎重地选择辅导员。我们觉得辅导员应具备这样的条件：一定的俄文水平；对于俄文速成学习有正确的认识和充分的信心；对速成学习的特点及一些基本环节有一定的了解。
    辅导员怎样具体地进行工作呢？
    第一，对于每天的课程必须有充分的准备。虽然不能要求他们和教员一样，能熟练地掌握教材，但在上课前必须多争取主讲教师的指导；在听课时，一方面要注意教员授课的主要精神，同时还须注意了解在教课中学员可能遇到的问题，哪些清楚，哪些不清楚；哪些易懂，哪些不易懂。这样在辅导时，才能有的放矢。
    第二，在辅导时，要有目的地解决问题，启发和帮助学员自行复习，这样才能使他们加深对课程的理解。有的辅导员由于对辅导的目的不明确，往往不管学员懂不懂，主观地根据重点重复讲一遍。因此，效果不大，而且影响了学员的自学时间。正确的作法是：在下课以后，要给学员一定的自学时间，先由他们提出问题，然后由辅导员来个别解答或集体解答。
    第三，辅导员对全组学员必须经常进行了解和检查。检查时不拘一定的时间和形式，方式可以多样。检查课堂作业时，要对每个学员作详细的了解，并把检查结果记录下来；尤其是对于“掉队”的学员，要记得更具体些。
    怎样帮助在学习中“掉队”的学员？
    首先分析“掉队”的原因，是思想问题还是学习方法不好。然后针对发生的问题，进行重点辅导。如果是复杂的思想问题，就要汇报组织员，协同解决；如果是学习方法问题，应耐心地帮助学员，要他们改变学习方法，但不能操之过急。其次，在学习中要适当减轻他们的功课负担。在学习条件上也要特别照顾他们，每天使他们保持足够的睡眠时间和一定的课外活动时间。
    循环记忆法的推广
    在第一阶段开始记生词时，有一部分学员采用了循环记忆法，效果较好的学员每小时能记八十个左右的生词，大部分效果很差。有的学员说：“记得快，忘得快。”有的学员有保守思想，不愿用这种方法。在第二阶段运用这种方法的效果仍然不好。大量突击生词以后，批判了各种保守思想，效果才有显著提高。成绩好的每小时能记一百八十五个生词，一般每小时能记住八十到一百五十个生词。记忆效率普遍提高了一倍以上。
    这就说明，我们在运用循环记忆法的过程中，是走过一段弯路的，原因是：第一，大家对循环记忆法的基本精神和特点了解得不够。有的教师直到最后还不知道循环记忆法的基本内容。因为教研组未能很好地推广这一新的学习方法。第二阶段后由于辅导员从实际学习中进一步掌握了循环记忆法的精神，才顺利进行了推广工作。第二，推广得过早。在第一阶段学员对发音还不熟练，还不会在分析生词时进行了推广工作，因此效果不好。第三，由于学员对循环记忆法的基本精神掌握得不够，循环周期的问题，更未能从组织上予以保证。从第二阶段后半期开始，每天早晨虽然规定半小时的复习时间，但每一阶段并未给予学员以较充分的复习检查时间。
    为了更好地推广循环记忆法，教研组必须在推广前进行动员。教员、辅导员和有关的工作人员必须进行认真的学习和实验，以便掌握其精神和特点。必须从组织上保证循环周期，每天应给予一定的时间进行复习检查，每一阶段应给予较充分的时间进行复习。
