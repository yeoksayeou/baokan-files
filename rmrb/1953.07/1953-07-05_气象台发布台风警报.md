Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Central Meteorological Observatory issued an emergency typhoon warning at 6:00 PM on the 4th, stating:

The strong typhoon that made landfall at Xinghua Bay, Fujian, at 2:00 PM on the 4th has rapidly weakened. Currently, the typhoon's center is moving in a west direction at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour. It is expected that the moving speed will slow down, and the intensity will continue to weaken.

Within the next 12 hours, wind speeds in Fujian Province may reach 14 to 24 meters per second (Force 7 to 9), with heavy rain. Southern Jiangsu, southeastern Anhui, all of Zhejiang, eastern Guangdong, eastern Jiangxi, the Poyang Lake estuary, and both banks of the Gan River may experience strong winds of 10 to 14 meters per second (Force 6 to 7). The East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea east of the Pearl River Estuary may experience strong winds of 14 to 20 meters per second (Force 7 to 8), with southerly winds and giant waves. The coast south of the Yangtze River Estuary and north of the Min River Estuary may experience high tides. All the above areas must take emergency precautions.

Within the next 24 hours, wind speeds in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, as well as southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, and eastern and northern Guangdong, will reach 10 to 15 meters per second (Force 5 to 7). Wind speeds in the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait may reach 12 to 20 meters per second (Force 6 to 8), with southeasterly winds and heavy rain. The coasts of the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait may experience high tides. Wind speeds in Poyang Lake and along the Gan River may reach 10 to 17 meters per second (Force 5 to 7). All the above areas still need to take precautions.

The threat posed by this typhoon to the Yellow Sea north of Lianyungang, the Bohai Strait, and the Shandong Peninsula has been reduced.
