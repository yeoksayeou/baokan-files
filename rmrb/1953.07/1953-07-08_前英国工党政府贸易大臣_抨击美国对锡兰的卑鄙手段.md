Xinhua News Agency, London, July 7th: TASS reports that former Labour government Trade Minister Harold Wilson criticized on the 4th the United States' decision to deal with Ceylon as "an insidious, extremely despicable act of desperate revenge." Wilson said: The United States' decision reveals that its loudly touted talk of eliminating world poverty is a lie. "The United States has announced that Ceylon will not be allowed to purchase U.S. helicopters unless it guarantees that the helicopters will not be used to eliminate pests in rubber plantations. The United States has banned the supply of sulfur to Ceylon for the elimination of rubber plantation pests for two years. Why? Because Ceylon ships a portion of its rubber to China in exchange for rice. Due to the hysteria stirred up by the Cold War, the United States is prohibiting the supply of equipment to Ceylon for eliminating agricultural pests, and is doing everything possible to prevent Ceylon from obtaining urgently needed rice."

    前英国工党政府贸易大臣
    抨击美国对锡兰的卑鄙手段
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：据报纸报道，前工党政府贸易大臣哈罗德·威尔逊四日批评美国作出对付锡兰的“阴险的、极其卑鄙地进行绝望报复的”决定。威尔逊说：美国的决定显露了它高唱的什么它在消除世界贫穷这种大话是骗人的。“美国宣布：如果不保证直升飞机不用来消灭橡胶园的害虫的话，就不准锡兰购进美国直升飞机。美国禁止供给锡兰消灭橡胶园害虫用的硫磺已经有两年了。原因何在？因为锡兰把一部分橡胶运到中国交换大米。由于冷战中煽动起来的歇斯底里，美国禁止供给锡兰消除农业虫害的器材，竭力阻挠锡兰得到迫切需要的大米。”
