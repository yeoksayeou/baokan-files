Reader's Letters Summary

    Welcoming the Signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Striving for Greater Victories on the Production Front
    Letter from the Grassroots Trade Union Correspondence Group of the Beijing General Machinery Plant: On July 27th, to ensure that employees learned about the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement as soon as possible, the leadership of our Beijing General Machinery Plant decided to end the lunch break half an hour early and organized employees to collectively listen to the broadcast about the event. Workers from various workshops gathered under the loudspeakers to listen quietly. Everyone unanimously supported the agreement reached in the Korean Armistice negotiations, expressed the need to remain vigilant and continue to work hard for the implementation of the agreement, and resolved to strive for greater victories on the production front.
    Comrade Liu Yuming, a worker at the plant and a model worker of Beijing, said after listening to the broadcast: "The signing of the armistice agreement is the result of the persistent efforts of the Chinese and Korean people; this fully proves that the world peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union are incomparably powerful." Veteran worker Liu Fengshu said: "We are extremely happy about the agreement reached in the armistice negotiations and will continue to be vigilant and make a hundredfold effort to achieve a complete and peaceful settlement of the Korean issue." Comrade Tian Yuan, director of the tool workshop, proposed: "We should use the enthusiasm for celebrating the signing of the Korean Armistice negotiations in production, and complete the tasks assigned to us by the state ahead of schedule." He expressed that he would combine this with the current production policy of the plant, lead the workers in his workshop to earnestly discuss the production plan for the second half of the year, overcome weak links and the difficulties of manufacturing special tools, and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule. Workers in the scraping group of the assembly workshop said: "Although the Korean armistice has been successfully agreed upon, we must remain vigilant and closely monitor whether the US warmongers and the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique will abide by the armistice agreement in the future." Young workers unanimously expressed that they would use the practical action of completing their apprenticeship contracts ahead of schedule to welcome the victory of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. They promised to study technology diligently, and on the basis of specialized division of labor, each person would guarantee to be able to take on a working procedure at the end of this apprenticeship contract, adding a strength to the construction of the motherland.
    The Signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Proves the Infinite Power of World Peace Forces
    Letter from the Correspondence Group of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau: After our bureau's employees heard the news of the agreement reached in the Korean Armistice Agreement, everyone was very happy. Some groups spontaneously organized discussions after listening to the broadcast, and everyone discussed it with great enthusiasm.
    Li Yongtai, a labor model of the Line Engineering Team of the Capital Construction Department, said at their team's group meeting: "The fact that this Korean Armistice Agreement can be signed shows that the strength of the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world is very strong. But we should not forget to be vigilant. We must redouble our efforts in our work to ensure the quality of the project and complete the tasks assigned to us by the state." Young worker Ding Weiqin said: "I am very happy to hear this news. The Korean Armistice negotiations have been going on for more than two years, and finally the armistice agreement was signed, which is the wish of the people of the world. But in the past, the US warmongers repeatedly delayed and obstructed the negotiations, and recently the US warmongers continued to condone Syngman Rhee's clamor against the armistice; this requires us to be extra vigilant." Huang Bangxu, a female employee of the business office, said: "The people of the world are concerned about and support the realization of the Korean armistice. If the US warmongers and the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique do not earnestly abide by the terms of the armistice agreement, they will suffer even greater defeats!"
    All Conspiracies to Sabotage the Korean Armistice
    Will Surely Be Completely Smashed by the Korean and Chinese People
    Letter from Ye Zufu, Shi Ming, Zhang Junqiang, Hu Lingshu, Yang Zhi, Li Yintan, Zhang Qingsheng, and Yu Jikui of the Qianmen District People's Government of Beijing: The Korean Armistice Agreement, due to the unremitting efforts of the Korean and Chinese people over the past two years, and after all kinds of twists and turns, has finally been fully agreed upon. This is another great victory for the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world!
    The complete agreement on the armistice is only the first step in a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Now Syngman Rhee is still clamoring against the armistice, and whether the armistice agreement can be effectively observed and implemented depends on whether the US side changes its attitude of condoning Syngman Rhee. Therefore, we must never be careless and must be extra vigilant to prevent all acts of sabotage of the armistice.
    We unanimously support the Korean Armistice Agreement and are determined to work and study harder to contribute the greatest strength to the construction of the motherland and world peace. At the same time, we want to warn the Syngman Rhee clique and the US warmongers that any conspiracy to obstruct and sabotage the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue will continue to be completely smashed in the face of the growing strength of the Korean and Chinese people and the world's peace forces!
    The Korean and Chinese People Must Continue to Work Hard
    To Strive for a Peaceful Solution to the Entire Korean Issue
    Letter from students of the Beijing Institute of Technology, etc.: The Korean Armistice negotiations, which lasted for more than two years, have finally reached a comprehensive agreement. All of our students realize that the agreement reached in the Korean Armistice negotiations proves the strength of the world's peace forces. Since the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique and the US warmongers colluded to launch the Korean War, they have been severely hit by the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the United States had to agree to hold armistice negotiations; during the negotiations, the US warmongers repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged the negotiations, only due to the firm efforts of the Korean and Chinese people, the Korean Armistice negotiations were finally agreed upon.
    The Korean and Chinese people have always advocated peace. Therefore, firmly implementing the armistice agreement is undoubtedly the case for the Korean and Chinese side; whether the armistice agreement can be implemented depends entirely on the attitude of the US side. Recently, Syngman Rhee
    has been clamoring to destroy the armistice, and some warmongers in the United States have publicly supported Syngman Rhee's clamor. We must be a hundred times more vigilant to prevent any provocative acts by the Syngman Rhee clique and all warmongers.
    The complete agreement reached in the Korean Armistice negotiations shows that any international dispute can be resolved through consultation on an equal footing. Of course, the Korean issue can only be completely resolved peacefully if it is discussed at a higher-level political conference. As long as this conference is convened on the basis of equal consultation, it can be resolved. We must continue to work tirelessly for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and resolutely oppose all acts of sabotage.
    The Korean and Chinese People Resolutely Abide by the Armistice Agreement
    Absolutely Will Not Allow the Other Side to Carry Out Sabotage Activities
    Letter from Zhang Yun, Director of the Department of Anatomy, Chinese Union Medical College: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people and a great victory for the cause of world peace. This victory is the result of the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers for three years to oppose aggression and defend peace, the result of the firm and unremitting efforts of the Korean and Chinese people to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue over the past two years, and the result of the active struggle of all peace-loving people in the world to strive for peace. When I participated in the delegation to Korea last year to express our condolences, I saw that every volunteer soldier deeply realized: The purpose of our anti-aggression war is to strive for a fair and reasonable peaceful solution to the Korean issue; our heroic attack on the aggressors will bring the Korean War to an end as soon as possible. Today, our most beloved people - the volunteer soldiers - have used their heroic fighting to promote the complete agreement reached in the Korean Armistice negotiations and the signing of the armistice agreement.
    However, the signing of the armistice agreement is only the first step in a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The Syngman Rhee clique is dissatisfied with the armistice, and some warmongers in the United States still openly support Syngman Rhee. We must be vigilant and closely monitor whether the United States continues to condone the Syngman Rhee clique's obstruction of the armistice. We, the Korean and Chinese side, are determined to abide by and implement the armistice agreement
    all the terms; but also will never allow the other side to have any actions that undermine the armistice. We will continue to work hard to strive for a peaceful solution to the entire Korean issue, and any warmongers who dare to carry out sabotage activities will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat as they did in the past.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    欢迎朝鲜停战协定签字
    要争取生产战线上更大胜利
    北京机器总厂基层工会通讯组来信：七月二十七日，我们北京机器总厂领导方面，为了使职工及早知道朝鲜停战协定签字的消息，决定中午提前半小时下班，组织职工集体收听有关这事的广播。各车间的工人都聚集在喇叭下边肃静地收听，大家一致拥护朝鲜停战谈判达成协议；表示要提高警惕，为协定的实施而继续努力；并决心在生产战线上争取更大的胜利。
    本厂工人、北京市劳动模范刘玉明同志听到广播后说：“停战协定的签订，是中朝人民坚持努力的结果；这完全证明了以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量是无比强大的。”老工人刘凤书说：“我们为停战谈判达成协议而感到无比高兴，并将继续提高警惕，百倍努力地争取朝鲜问题的完全和平解决。”工具车间主任田元同志提出：“我们应当把庆祝朝鲜停战谈判签字的热情用到生产中去，提前完成国家交给我们的任务。”他表示要结合目前本厂的生产方针，带动本车间工人认真讨论下半年的生产计划，克服薄弱环节和制造专用工具的困难，争取提前完成任务。装配车间刮研小组工人们说：“朝鲜停战虽然胜利地达成协议了，我们还必须提高警惕，密切注意美国好战分子和李承晚反动集团今后是否遵守停战协定。”青工同志们一致表示要用提前完成师徒合同的实际行动来迎接朝鲜停战协定签字这个胜利。他们保证要认真学习技术，在专业化分工的基础上，每个人保证在本期师徒合同结束时能担任起一道工作程序，为建设祖国增加一分力量。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订
    证明世界和平力量无限强大
    北京电业局通讯组来信：我局职工听到朝鲜停战协定达成协议的消息后，大家都很高兴。有的小组听完广播后就自动组织起来漫谈，大家讨论得都很带劲。
    基本建设处线路工程队的劳动模范李永泰在他们班的小组会上说：“这次朝鲜停战协定能够签字，正说明朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民的力量是非常强大的。但是我们不应忘掉提高警惕。我们在工作上更要加倍努力，保证工程的质量，来完成国家交给我们的任务。”青工丁维琴说：“我听了这个消息很高兴。朝鲜停战谈判进行了两年多，最后终于签订了停战协定，这是全世界人民的愿望。但是过去在谈判中，美国好战分子一再拖延阻挠，最近美国好战分子还继续纵容李承晚反对停战的叫嚣；这需要我们加倍警惕。”营业所的女职员黄邦序说：“全世界人民都关心和拥护朝鲜停战的实现，如果美国好战分子和李承晚反动集团不切实遵守停战协定的条款，它们就会遭到更大的失败！”
    一切破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋
    必将被朝中人民彻底粉碎
    北京市前门区人民政府叶祖孚、石铭、张俊强、胡灵书、杨志、李荫檀、张庆生、俞季逵来信：朝鲜停战协定，由于朝中两国人民两年来不懈的努力，经过种种的曲折，终于完全达成协议了。这是中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的又一巨大胜利！
    停战协定的完全达成协议，还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。现在李承晚还在叫嚣反对停战，停战协定是否能被切实遵守和执行，就要看美方是否改变纵容李承晚的态度。因此我们绝不能麻痹大意，必须加倍提高警惕，防止一切破坏停战的行为。
    我们一致拥护朝鲜停战协定，并决心加倍努力地工作和学习，为祖国建设和世界和平献出最大的力量。同时，我们要警告李承晚集团和美国好战分子，任何阻挠和破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋，都将继续在日益壮大的朝中人民和世界和平力量的面前被彻底粉碎！
    朝中人民要继续努力
    争取和平解决整个朝鲜问题
    北京工业学院等同学来信：历时两年多的朝鲜停战谈判，终于达成全面协议了。我们全体同学都认识到：朝鲜停战谈判的达成协议，正说明了全世界和平力量的强大。自从李承晚反动集团和美国好战分子相勾结，发动了朝鲜战争以来，遭到了英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军沉重的打击，美国才不得不同意举行停战谈判；在谈判过程中，美国好战分子一再阻挠并破坏谈判，只是由于朝中人民的坚定努力，朝鲜停战谈判才最后终于达成了协议。
    朝中人民一贯是主张和平的。因此，坚决地执行停战协定，对朝中方面来说是没有疑义的；停战协定能否贯彻执行完全要看美方的态度。最近李承晚
    一直叫嚣要破坏停战，美国一部分好战分子还对李承晚这种叫嚣公开支持。我们一定要百倍提高警惕，以防止李承晚集团及一切好战分子的任何挑衅行为。
    朝鲜停战谈判全部达成协议说明了任何国际纠纷都是可以在平等的基础上用协商的办法来解决的。当然朝鲜问题要能够完全达到和平解决，还需要在高一级的政治会议中去讨论。这个会议只要是在平等协商的基础上召开，就一定可以解决的。我们一定要为和平解决朝鲜问题而继续不懈地努力，并坚决反对一切破坏活动。
    朝中人民坚决遵守停战协定
    决不允许对方进行破坏活动
    中国协和医学院解剖学系主任张鋆来信：朝鲜停战协定的签订是朝中人民的一个伟大胜利，是世界和平事业的一个伟大胜利。这个胜利，是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军三年来为反对侵略、保卫和平而英勇作战的成果，是朝中人民两年来为争取和平解决朝鲜问题而坚定不懈地努力协商的成果，是全世界爱好和平人民积极为争取和平而进行斗争的成果。在去年我参加赴朝慰问团到朝鲜去的时候，看到每一个志愿军战士都深刻地认识：我们进行反侵略战争的目的，就是争取朝鲜问题能够公平合理地得到和平解决；我们英勇地打击侵略者，就将使朝鲜战争早日结束。今天，我们最可爱的人——志愿军战士们已经用他们的英勇战斗，促使朝鲜停战谈判全部达成协议而签订了停战协定。
    但是，停战协定的签订只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。李承晚集团是对停战不满的，美国方面仍有一部分好战分子公然支持李承晚。我们必须提高警惕，密切注视美国是否继续纵容李承晚集团阻挠停战。我们朝中方面是坚决遵守和执行停战协定的
    一切条款的；但也决不允许对方有任何破坏停战的行动。我们将继续努力争取整个朝鲜问题的和平解决，任何好战分子如果胆敢进行破坏活动，它们必将像过去一样遭到可耻的失败。
