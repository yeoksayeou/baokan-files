The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in the Shandong area has achieved relatively significant results. The enlarged cadre meeting of county committee secretaries and above, convened by the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee in early June, summarized the spring work and also summarized the experiences of this struggle. The anti-bureaucracy struggle in the Shandong area, adhering to the principle of "active leadership and steady progress," closely integrated with the current work to gradually deepen. In the spring production work, the bureaucratic and commandist ideology and work methods of being detached from reality and the masses have been overcome relatively universally. The ideology and work methods of linking with reality and the masses have gradually taken a dominant position in some areas, enabling spring production work and other work closely integrated with production to achieve greater success. The cadres who participated in this enlarged meeting unanimously believed that although this shift in ideology and work methods was still preliminary and the development was extremely uneven, it was indeed a relatively significant shift. The conclusion of the grassroots cadres on this significant shift was: "The mass line is indeed good, it works smoothly, things go smoothly, the cadres are satisfied, and the masses are happy." The masses' conclusion was: "This year there are five goods: timely planting is good, technical research is good, wheat grows well, meetings are well held, and the attitude of the cadres is good."

This meeting focused on summarizing the transformation of this ideology and work method in the spring work. The main achievements and experiences are as follows:

First, party committees at all levels paid attention to grasping spring plowing and production as the overriding central task, strengthened the unified leadership of the party, and initially overcame the serious phenomenon of decentralization, thereby reducing the prominent "five-more" phenomenon in grassroots organizations.

Since the enlarged meeting of the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee in December last year, party committees from the province to the counties and cities have examined the leadership of the party committees to varying degrees; carried out criticism and self-criticism, and criticized decentralism, thereby beginning to improve the party committee system and initially strengthening the party's unified leadership. On the basis of improving the party committee system, the work of unifying the ideology of the whole party was carried out, and the cadres were repeatedly explained the principle of taking spring plowing and production as the overriding central task, and the interrelationship between the central work and other tasks. According to the instructions of higher authorities and in combination with the actual local conditions, arrangements were made according to the season and stage, distinguishing between priorities and urgency, and strict control was exercised. The system of requesting instructions and making reports was strictly implemented for major issues concerning guidelines and policies. For the work deployment of certain business departments at higher levels, if it violated the unified plan of the central government and the higher party committee, hindered the implementation of the central work, or did not conform to the actual situation, resulting in damage to the interests of the masses, the situation was reported in a timely manner, and a request was made to postpone or stop the work, implementing supervision by the lower levels. In this way, the unified leadership of the party committees in some areas has been strengthened, the working principle of taking spring plowing and production as the overriding task has been implemented, and the "five-more" phenomenon in grassroots organizations has been reduced. The cadres below reflected: "This year the center is clear, and the work is smooth." The masses reflected: "Life is better, production is easier, and the higher-ups don't make trouble." Not only the center of spring plowing and production has been clarified, but other related work has also been driven forward.

Second, leading cadres at all levels went deep into the grassroots and strengthened specific leadership, initially overcoming the serious bureaucratic style and reducing the general commandist style.

In strengthening specific leadership and overcoming bureaucracy and commandism, the following three links were mainly grasped: First, throughout the entire work process, it was emphasized that the situation at the lower levels should be analyzed and studied, and the tasks, policies, and methods should be specifically explained. This spring, under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels from the province to the county, more than 14,000 cadres were organized to go to the countryside to help and inspect work; to summarize the experience of implementing policies and implementing the mass line, and pay attention to correcting the past erroneous practice of judging the merits and demerits only from the superficial phenomenon of completing the task numbers. The county party committee adopted the method of holding meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels to summarize the work, carry out criticism, and implement the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. At these meetings, the leading side first examined the bureaucratic style, promoted democracy, carried out criticism, and guided the cadres below to examine the commandist style and expose violations of law and discipline; then, good people and good deeds were commended, and the working methods of the mass line were introduced. Second, grasp the base points at all levels, create experience, and guide various tasks. This is an important key to overcoming the generalized leadership style and realizing specific guidance. At present, at the prefectural and county party committee levels alone, 587 base points have been set up throughout the province, and 2,932 full-time cadres have participated in the base point work. Many district party committees and township branches have also set up base points. For example, in Junan County, the base point work was generally grasped in each district and township. Many district, township, and village cadres have learned to use typical methods to guide the work. When carrying out various tasks, party committees at all levels also made the base point work take the lead, set an example, and promoted others. Many advanced experiences were also successfully tested in the base points before being promoted. In this way, in some areas, not only the "mass movement" and coercive command style were avoided, but also various tasks could be carried out quickly and steadily. Third, use the method of typical demonstration to promote work. At present, many districts and townships pay attention to doing a good job in typical cases first when carrying out various tasks, making a model, and then driving them at all levels, demonstrating them specifically, leading by cadres, and gradually promoting them. When guiding the masses to use "watching wells" (referring to the wells dug by coercive commands last year) to irrigate the land, the Junan Sixth District Committee adopted the method of typical demonstration, so that 123 of the 229 "watching wells" in the district were used. Some areas have begun to pay attention to cultivating various types of typical cases according to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and the uneven development of work, in order to guide the work in different areas. Some county party committees have begun to summarize typical cases first when holding meetings, and make models before carrying out work. Therefore, cadres said: With models, there are methods, and there is no need for coercive commands. The masses said: In the past, cadres said before doing, but now they do before saying.

Third, the key to increasing agricultural production has been grasped, and the method of combining technical guidance with the mass line has been implemented.

This spring, leading cadres at all levels, in leading agricultural production, have paid attention to increasing the actual income of farmers as the goal, and strived to find different key to increasing production according to different regions, different conditions, and different crops. For example, Junan County, according to the conditions of the mountainous areas, found the key to increasing production of "preparing the land and protecting seedlings." Guangrao County, according to the conditions of saline-alkali land, found the key to increasing production of "anti-alkali, drought prevention, and seedling protection." In agricultural technical guidance, some areas have adopted the method of combining technical guidance with the mass line, and combining political work with economic work, so that political work cadres, economic work cadres, technicians, labor models and activists are combined to learn from each other. And seize the link of holding agricultural technology seminars at all levels to impart and promote technology. This meeting implemented the leadership method of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." In this way, after cadres learned several necessary technologies, they brought the technology to the countryside, implemented small-scale lectures at night, on-site guidance during the day, and at the same time called on the masses to ask questions at any time, and immediately solve various technical problems, which made various technical experiences rapidly promoted.

Fourth, the policy of serving agricultural production with material supply and credit work has been implemented.

This year, the material supply and credit work in various places have undergone great changes in serving production. In some areas, under the resolute implementation of the policy of serving agricultural production with material supply and credit work, a large number of bank cadres and supply and marketing cooperative cadres were organized to go to the countryside to participate in spring plowing and production. These cadres, in the process of going deep into rural production, understood the production needs of the masses through production activities, and then organized material supply realistically according to this need. In this way, many supply and marketing cooperative cadres initially reversed the purely profit-making point of view under the premise of serving spring plowing and production, and learned to use several simple technologies such as step plows, waterwheels, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, thereby strengthening the technical guidance in material supply and expanding the supply and marketing business. This proves that the best way to supply materials is to combine them with technical guidance, and it is best to help the cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives learn a few simple technologies and bring the technology to the countryside. Then, there will be a way to promote new agricultural tools, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers. So some cadres said: "This year there is no need for coercive commands. We have the capital to talk to the masses, and the business is easy to do." For example, the supply and marketing cooperative of Wendeng Prefecture, due to the adoption of the method of combining material supply with technical guidance, not only made the past "sleeping cars" (waterwheels) and "hanging plows" (step plows) active, but also sold 135 waterwheels and 1,802 step plows in the entire region this spring, an increase of 254% compared with the same period last year.

Fifth, starting from the current situation of the small-scale peasant economy, the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been strengthened, and the tendency of blind and rash advancement is being vigorously corrected.

This spring, from the branch bureau, party committees at all levels established base points at all levels, grasped typical mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and gained some experience. These base point experiences have played a certain role in implementing the policy of "steady progress", correcting the tendency of blind and rash advancement, and guiding the normal development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Since the Central Committee issued three documents on spring plowing and production to party committees at all levels, the branch bureau has successively issued instructions and notices, requiring leading cadres above the county level to study seriously and improve their level of awareness, so as to deeply criticize bureaucracy, commandism, subjectivism and other errors, and further recognize the harm of blind and rash advancement. When formulating patriotic production increase plans, some regions paid attention to starting from reality and finding the key to production increase according to local conditions, so the production increase plans of many mutual aid teams and cooperatives this year are more practical and feasible than last year. When sorting out mutual aid and cooperation organizations, some regions began to pay attention to starting from the actual income that is beneficial to production and increasing farmers' income, and gradually improving the methods of operation and management according to the specific conditions within the team and the society. Therefore, the peasants said: "We have taken the right path, but we are walking too fast. If we fall down, we will get up and walk slowly." This sentence reflects that many masses have explored the correct views and practices to correct the tendency of blind and rash advancement.

In addition, various types of mutual aid groups and cooperatives have begun to pay attention to uniting individual farmers in all aspects. For example, Guangrao County invited individual farmers to participate in introducing production increase experience in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, so that they have the opportunity to learn advanced production technology. Mutual aid groups and cooperatives actively help individual farmers with production difficulties to solve their difficulties.

Sixth, the mass line method is used to carry out disaster relief and preparedness, and to fight against various natural disasters.

Due to the anti-bureaucracy, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of law and discipline struggles carried out from top to bottom, leading cadres at all levels generally paid attention to and strengthened the leadership of disaster relief work in disaster areas, and took various effective measures to carry out mass production and self-relief movements. Therefore, they initially overcame the famine, stabilized the emotions of the masses, and basically ensured that the disaster victims had food to eat and land to plant. In leading the masses to fight against various natural disasters, some areas have achieved more significant results. In the former Tengxian Prefecture, 36.8% of the wheat suffered various degrees of disaster, but after rescue, the average yield per mu of wheat in the entire region still reached 98 jin, exceeding the level of 83 jin per mu of the total average yield of the province. The achievement of this result is due to the fact that the party committees at all levels in those areas resolutely implemented the "taking production for disaster relief as the overriding center" in the disaster areas, and deeply mobilized the masses to implement the policy of production for self-relief, and sent cadres to the disaster areas to hold meetings of activists, symposiums with old farmers, and meetings of disaster victims, etc., to effectively grasp the disaster situation, correctly publicize the party's lending policy, study ways to overcome the famine, and carry out the education of "mutual assistance between neighbors" and "unity to overcome the famine", and carry out free lending and social mutual assistance.

The above achievements and experiences were explored in the spring work of the province. The Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee pointed out in its summary that this transformation is only a good start, and there are still some shortcomings in some work. For example, some comrades in some departments still hold various erroneous ideas and attitudes towards strengthening the unified leadership of the party committee, such as saying: "Now it is good, unified leadership, let's give everything to it (referring to the party committee)!" Some said: "During the spring plowing and production period, you overwhelmed me. When spring plowing is over, I will overwhelm you again (meaning to engage in business in isolation)." After opposing bureaucracy and commandism, a few rural cadres still hold a negative attitude in their work. There is still blindness in the allocation of materials by the supply and marketing cooperatives, and not enough attention is paid to the supply of small agricultural tools, resulting in a great shortage of small agricultural tools. There is still formalism in the base point work of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline has only been initially deepened throughout the province, and the development of this struggle is still extremely uneven. The branch bureau summary also pointed out: The main reasons for the slow progress in regions and departments are that the ideological awareness of leading cadres is not high, there are ideological obstacles, some are complacent and paralyzed, and the vigilance is not enough, some are afraid of side effects, some are afraid of self-criticism, some think there is a contradiction with the work, some are indulgent and tolerant to mistakes, and even some cadres retaliate against critics. These are the resistances from the right. On the other hand, in a few cadres, there are deviations from the "left", such as excessively high and urgent demands, excessively broad scope of attack, and excessively heavy and numerous punishments. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate these two aspects of ideological obstacles, carry out the struggle on two fronts, and in continuing to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, implement the correct policies and methods, fully promote democracy, implement self-criticism, and further change the style of cadres.

According to the party central committee's guidelines, line, and east china bureau's instructions, according to the actual work situation of shandong, according to the experience in the spring work, the ccp central committee shandong branch decided in the meeting summary that the specific policies of the shandong work before the autumn harvest are: continue to implement the leading of agricultural production as the overriding central task of the rural areas, be good at adapting to the agricultural season and agricultural situation, adapt to local conditions in a timely manner, grasp the key to increasing production, implement the agricultural technology guidance of the mass line, strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, continue to improve supply and marketing and credit work, make it truly serve agricultural production, and pay special attention to the struggle against various natural disasters, implement the principle of leading the masses to produce self-relief in the disaster-stricken areas supplemented by the government's active support, and effectively do a good job in production and disaster relief. In short, we must do everything possible to overcome various natural disasters and overcome famine, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest. At the same time, the working policy after the autumn harvest was determined. And under this policy, the work of carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, as well as party rectification, general election and other items were specifically arranged.

This enlarged cadre meeting convened by the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee and the enlarged meeting of the Branch Bureau in December last year are of basic construction significance and serious historical significance for the party organizations in Shandong and the work in Shandong. Since this meeting was attended by county party secretaries from all over the province, the spirit of the meeting can be more easily directly implemented to the county. This will ensure that the party central committee's guidelines and line are better realized in Shandong.

    中共中央山东分局春季工作总结表明
    反官僚主义斗争成效显著
    【本报讯】反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，在山东地区已获得比较显著的成效。六月初中共中央山东分局所召开的县委书记以上的扩大干部会议总结春季工作时，也总结了这一斗争的经验。山东地区反官僚主义斗争本着“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，密切结合当前工作逐步深入，在春季生产的各项工作中，比较普遍地克服了脱离实际脱离群众的官僚主义与命令主义的思想作风和工作方法，联系实际联系群众的思想作风和工作方法在若干地区逐渐占了主导地位，已使春季生产工作和与生产密切结合进行的其他工作得到较大的成绩。参加这次扩大会议的干部一致认为这种思想作风和工作方法的转变虽然还是初步的，发展也是极不平衡的，但确实是比较显著的转变。对这一显著的转变，基层干部的结论是：“到底是群众路线好，一行就通，办事顺当，干部满意，群众欢喜。”群众的结论是：“今年有五好：耕种适时好，技术研究好，小麦长的好，会议开得好，干部态度好。”
    这次会议着重总结了春季工作中这种思想作风和工作方法的转变，主要的成绩和经验有以下几点：
    第一，各级党委都注意掌握了以春耕生产为压倒一切的中心任务，加强了党的统一领导，初步克服了严重的分散现象，从而减少了基层组织中突出的
    “五多”现象。
    自去年十二月中共中央山东分局扩大会议以后，从省到各县市委都深度不同地检查了党委的领导；开展了批评和自我批评，批判了分散主义，从而开始健全党委制，初步地加强了党的统一领导。在健全党委制的基础上，进而进行统一全党的思想的工作，向干部反复讲明以春耕生产为压倒一切的中心任务的道理，和中心工作与其他各项工作的相互关系。并根据上级指示，结合当地实际情况，按季节、按阶段，分别轻重缓急，统一安排，严格控制。对有关方针、政策的重大问题，严格执行了请示报告制度。对于上级某些业务部门的工作部署，如违背中央和上级党委的统一计划，妨害中心工作的贯彻，或者不符合实际情况，以致损害群众利益的，就及时反映情况，请求推迟或停止进行，实行下级的监督。这样，若干地区党委的统一领导加强了，以春耕生产为压倒一切的工作方针贯彻了，基层组织中的“五多”现象减少了。下面干部反映：“今年中心明确了，工作顺劲了。”群众反映：“日子好过了，生产好搞了，上级不闹蹩扭了。”不仅春耕生产中心明确了，而且其他各项结合工作也被带动起来了。
    第二，各级领导干部深入下层，加强了具体领导，初步克服了严重的官僚主义作风，减少了一般的命令主义作风。
    在加强具体领导、克服官僚主义和命令主义方面，主要是掌握了以下三个环节：第一，在整个工作过程中，强调要分析研究下情，具体交代任务、政策、做法等。今年春季，从省到县，在各级党委的统一领导下，共组织了一万四千余名干部下乡帮助和检查工作；总结执行政策和贯彻群众路线的经验，注意纠正过去那种只从完成任务数字的表面现象来评定优劣的错误做法。县委则采取召开县、区、乡三级干部会议的办法，总结工作，开展批评，贯彻反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争。在这些会议上，首先由领导方面检讨官僚主义作风，发扬民主，开展批评，引导下面干部检讨命令主义作风与揭发违法乱纪现象；再进一步表扬好人好事，介绍群众路线的工作方法。第二，层层掌握基点，创造经验，指导各种工作。这是克服一般化领导作风、实现具体指导的重要关键。目前，全省仅地委、县委两级，已设置基点五百八十七个，参加基点工作的专职干部已有二千九百三十二名。许多区委和乡支部也设立了基点。例如莒南县，各区、乡一般都掌握了基点工作。许多区、乡、村干部都学会了运用典型指导工作的方法。各级党委在进行各项工作时，也大都使基点工作先行一步，作出样子，推动其他。许多先进经验也都先在基点内试验成功之后，再行推广。这样，在若干地区不仅避免了“大呼隆”和强迫命令的作风，而且使各种工作能够迅速而稳步地开展起来。第三，采用典型示范的方法，推动工作。现在许多区、乡在进行各项工作时都注意了首先搞好典型，作出样子，再层层带动、具体示范、干部带头、逐步推广。郓城六区区委在指导群众使用“看井”（指去年强迫命令打下的井）浇地时，采用了典型示范的方法，使全区二百二十九眼“看井”中有一百二十三眼被运用起来了。有的地区已开始注意根据小农经济特点和工作发展的不平衡等特点，有意识地培养各种不同种类的典型，用以指导不同地区的工作。有的县委已开始作到了召开会议先总结典型，开展工作先作出样子。因此，干部说：有了样子就有了办法，再不用强迫命令了。群众说：过去干部是先说后作，现在是先作后说。
    第三，掌握了农业的增产关键，贯彻了技术指导和群众路线相结合的方法。
    今年春季，各级领导干部在领导农业生产上，已经注意到以增加农民实际收入为目的，并努力按照不同地区、不同条件、不同作物，找出不同的增产关键。例如，莒南县根据山岭地区的条件，找出
    “整地保苗”的增产关键。广饶县根据碱地的条件，找出了“抗碱、防旱、保苗”的增产关键。在农业技术指导上，若干地区都采取了技术指导与群众路线相结合、政治工作与经济工作相结合的方法，使政治工作干部、经济工作干部、技术人员和劳动模范、积极分子，四者结合起来互相学习。并抓住开好各级农业技术座谈会这一环节，来传授和推广技术。这种会议贯彻了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的领导方法。这样，干部学会了几种必需的技术之后，就带了技术下乡，实行夜间开小会传授，白天到现场指导，同时号召群众随时来问，当即解决各种技术问题，这就使各种技术经验得到迅速推广。
    第四，贯彻了物资供应和信贷工作为农业生产服务的方针。
    今年各地的物资供应和信贷工作，在为生产服务方面有了很大的转变。若干地区在坚决贯彻物资供应和信贷工作为农业生产服务的方针下，组织了大批的银行干部、供销社干部下乡，参加春耕生产。这些干部在深入农村生产过程中，通过生产活动了解群众的生产需要，然后根据这种需要，切合实际地组织物资供应。这样，许多供销社干部在服务于春耕生产的前提下初步地扭转了单纯营利观点，学会了使用步犁、水车、化学肥料、农药等几项简单的技术，从而加强了物资供应中的技术指导，扩大了供销业务。由此证明物资供应最好与技术指导相结合，最好帮助供销社干部学习几项简单的技术，带技术下乡，那么，推销新式农具和农药、化学肥料时就有了办法。所以有的干部说：“今年不用强迫命令了，和群众说话有本钱了，业务工作也好搞了。”如文登专区供销社由于采用了物资供应与技术指导相结合的方法，不仅使过去的“睡车”（水车）、“挂犁”（步犁）都活动起来了，而且全区今春又推销了水车一百三十五部，步犁一千八百零二张，比去年同期增加了百分之二百五十四。
    第五，从小农经济的现状出发，加强了对互助合作运动的领导，有力地纠正着盲目冒进偏向。
    今年春季，从分局起，各级党委都层层建立了基点，掌握了典型互助组和农业生产合作社，并取得了一些经验。这些基点经验，对于贯彻“稳步前进”的方针，纠正盲目冒进的偏向和指导互助合作运动的正常发展，都起了一定的作用。自中央发出关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示等三个文件以后，分局即连续发出了指示和通知，要求县以上领导干部认真学习，提高觉悟水平，以便深入地批判官僚主义、命令主义、主观主义等错误，进一步认识盲目冒进的危害性。有的地区在制订爱国增产计划时，注意了从实际出发，根据当地条件，因地制宜地找增产关键，因而今年许多互助组和合作社的增产计划比去年切实可行。有的地区在整理互助合作组织时，开始注意了从有利于生产和增加农民的实际收入出发，根据组内、社内的具体条件，逐步地改进经营管理的方法。因此，农民说：“咱们路是走对了，就是走的太急了，跌倒了爬起来慢慢走就是了。”这句话反映了不少群众已摸索到纠正盲目冒进偏向的正确看法和做法。
    此外，各类互助组和合作社已开始注意从各方面团结单干农民。例如，广饶县在互助合作组织内介绍增产经验时，邀请单干农民参加，使他们有机会学习先进生产技术。对生产有困难的单干农民，互助组和合作社就主动地帮助他们解决困难。
    第六，采用群众路线的方法进行救灾备荒，并与各种自然灾害作斗争。
    由于自上而下地开展了反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，各级领导干部一般都重视和加强了对灾区的生产救灾工作的领导，采取了各项有效措施，开展了群众性的生产自救运动。因而，初步地战胜了灾荒，稳定了群众情绪，基本上保证了灾民吃上饭种上地。在领导群众与各种自然灾害进行斗争中，若干地区成绩更为显著。前滕县专区曾有百分之三十六点八的小麦遭受各种不同程度的灾害，但经过抢救，全区小麦每亩的平均产量仍达到九十八斤，超过全省总平均产量每亩八十三斤的水平。这个成绩的获得，是由于那些地区的各级党委在灾区坚决贯彻了“以生产救灾为压倒一切的中心”和深入发动群众实行生产自救的方针，并派遣干部深入灾区，召开积极分子会、老农座谈会和灾民会等，切实掌握灾情，正确宣传党的借贷政策，研究渡荒办法，进行“亲邻互助”、“团结渡荒”的教育，开展了自由借贷和社会互助。
    上述这些成绩和经验是在全省春季工作中摸索出来的。中共中央山东分局总结中指出这个转变只是良好的开端，有些工作还存在一些缺点，如某些部门同志对加强党委统一领导还抱着各种不同的错误思想和态度，如说：“现在好了，统一领导了，什么事都拥给它（指党委）吧！”有的说：“春耕生产期间你压倒了我，到春耕过去，我就再压过来（意即孤立地搞业务）。”少数乡村干部在反官僚主义命令主义之后，工作上还抱着消极态度。供销社在物资调拨上还存在盲目性，在小农具的供应上还注意不够，致使小农具十分缺乏。互助合作运动的基点工作方面还有形式主义的毛病。反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争只是在全省范围内初步深入，而且这一斗争的发展还极不平衡。分局总结还指出：进展迟缓的地区、部门，主要原因是领导干部思想觉悟不高，存有思想障碍，有的是自满麻痹、警惕不够，有的是害怕副作用，有的是害怕自我批评，有的是认为与工作有矛盾，有的是对犯错误的纵容姑息，甚至有的干部对批评者打击报复。这些是来自右面的阻力。另方面，在少数干部中，则有来自“左”面的偏向，如要求过高过急，打击面过广，处分过重、过多。因此，必须扫除这两方面的思想障碍，开展两条战线的斗争，在继续深入开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争中，执行正确的方针政策和方法，充分发扬民主，实行自我批评，进一步地转变干部的作风。
    根据党中央的方针、路线和华东局的指示，根据山东的实际工作情况，根据春季工作中的经验，中共中央山东分局在会议总结中决定了在秋收前山东工作的具体方针是：继续贯彻以领导农业生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务，善于适应农时农情，因时因地制宜，掌握增产关键，贯彻群众路线的农业技术指导，加强对互助合作组织的领导，继续改善供销、信贷工作，使之切实为农业生产服务，并特别注意与各种自然灾害作斗争，在有灾地区贯彻以领导群众生产自救为主加以政府积极扶持的方针，切实做好生产救灾工作。总之，要为战胜各种自然灾害克服灾荒，争取秋季丰收而竭尽一切努力。同时确定了秋收以后的工作方针。并在这一方针下，具体地安排了开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，以及整党、普选等项工作。
    这次中共中央山东分局召开的扩大干部会议与去年十二月的分局扩大会议，对于山东地区的党组织与山东地区的工作，都具有基本建设的意义，具有严重的历史意义。由于这次会议有全省县委书记参加，因而会议的精神就比较容易直接贯彻到县。这将保证党中央的方针、路线在山东地区更好地实现。
