    Correcting the Practice of Randomly Copying Documents
    A letter from Liu Xijiu of the Central Ministry of Commerce: The current situation of certain organizations randomly copying documents is very serious. For example, recently, some problems arose between the Hei Shan County Cotton Company of Liaoxi Province and the Liaoyang Textile Factory in cotton inspection work. They wrote to the Northeast Textile Industry Administration for handling. However, this letter was copied to eleven organizations, including the Central Ministry of Commerce, the Central Ministry of Textile Industry, the Northeast Administrative Committee, the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee, and the Northeast People's Supervisory Committee. A cotton processing factory in Chaoyang County, under the Rehe Province Cotton Company, had a dispute with the Liaoyang Textile Factory in the execution of a contract, and wrote to the Northeast Textile Industry Administration requesting resolution. This letter was copied to nineteen units, including the Central Ministry of Textile Industry, the Central Ministry of Commerce, the Northeast Administrative Committee, the Northeast Regional Fiber Inspection Institute, the Rehe Province People's Government Commercial Department, the CCP Liaoyang Municipal Committee, the CCP Chaoyang County Committee, and the Liaoyang Cotton Company. The Central Ministry of Textile Industry wrote to the Central and Southern Finance and Economics Committee regarding finding office space for the Central and Southern Region Cotton Grade Standard Imitation Committee (which, in principle, should be resolved locally in Wuhan). However, the personnel handling this matter copied this letter to four organizations, including the Central Finance and Economics Committee and the Central Ministry of Commerce. Soon after, the Central and Southern Finance and Economics Committee replied to the Central Ministry of Textile Industry saying that the office space had been found, and also copied it to these four organizations.
    This practice of randomly copying documents not only wastes manpower and resources but also makes work more difficult. For some specific problems in the work of local organizations, such as the problems in the work of the Hei Shan County Cotton Company and the Chaoyang County Cotton Processing Factory mentioned earlier, the central leading organs do not understand the specific situation and it is difficult to handle the documents even after receiving them. Furthermore, its direct superior leading organ may wait for instructions because it sees that the document has been copied to the central leading organs, which prevents the problem from being resolved in a timely manner. Therefore, I suggest that each organization must carefully consider the role that the document can play after it is copied to the other party when copying documents to an organization.

### 纠正随便抄送文件的做法

专栏：读者来信摘要

    纠正随便抄送文件的做法
    中央商业部刘锡九来信：目前某些机关随便抄送文件的情况很严重。如最近辽西省黑山县棉花公司与辽阳纺织厂在棉花检验工作中发生了一些问题，写信要求东北纺织工业管理局处理；而这一信件竟抄送给中央商业部、中央纺织工业部、东北行政委员会、东北财政经济委员会、东北人民监察委员会等十一个机关。热河省棉花公司所属朝阳县一个棉花加工厂与辽阳纺织厂在执行合同中发生纠纷，写信给东北纺织工业管理局请求解决；而这封信竟抄给中央纺织工业部、中央商业部、东北行政委员会、东北区纤维检验所、热河省人民政府商业厅、中共辽阳市委、中共朝阳县委、辽阳棉花公司等十九个单位。中央纺织工业部为中南区棉花品级标准仿制委员会找办公房屋问题，写信给中南财政经济委员会
    （按理应在武汉就地解决），但经办此事的人员却将这封信抄给中央财政经济委员会、中央商业部等四个机关；不久中南财政经济委员会复信给中央纺织工业部说房子已找到了，也抄送给这四个机关。
    这种随便抄送文件的做法，不但浪费人力物力，同时也使工作增加了困难。地方机关工作中的某些具体问题，像前面所举的黑山县棉花公司和朝阳县棉花加工厂工作中的问题，中央领导机关不了解具体情况，接到文件也很难处理；而它的直属上级领导机关又可能因为看到这个文件已抄送中央领导机关而等候指示，反使问题不能及时解决。因此，我建议各机关抄送文件给一个机关时，必须慎重考虑这个文件抄送给对方以后所能发生的作用。
