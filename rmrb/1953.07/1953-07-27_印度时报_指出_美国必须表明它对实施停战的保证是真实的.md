    "The Times of India" Points Out
    The United States Must Show That Its Guarantee for Implementing a Ceasefire is Genuine
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] New Delhi Dispatch: "The Times of India" pointed out on the 25th: In his recent statement, Syngman Rhee accused the United States of violating the promises made to him by Walter Robertson with the guarantees offered to the Korean and Chinese sides. The U.S. government must clarify its position on this issue. The newspaper stated, "In order to save the reputation of the United Nations (if not to save the ceasefire), the U.S. government must prove to the world that Syngman Rhee's words are untrue and explain that, in fact, there is no contradiction between the guarantees given by the Allied forces to North Korea and the promises given to South Korea."
    The newspaper said: Syngman Rhee's accusations inevitably raise doubts as to whether the guarantees given by the United States to the Korean and Chinese side "are as straightforward and clear as they should be." The newspaper said that the world has "rarely seen such a pathetic display of public stupidity as that demonstrated by the U.S. government."

    “印度时报”指出
    美国必须表明它对实施停战的保证是真实的
    【新华社二十六日讯】新德里消息：“印度时报”二十五日指出：李承晚在最近的声明中指责美国向朝中方面提出的保证违反了华尔特·罗伯逊向他提出的诺言。美国政府必须在这个问题上表明态度。该报说，“为了挽救联合国的名誉（如果不是为了挽救停战的话），美国政府必须向全世界证明，李承晚所说的话都是不真实的，并说明事实上联军方面给予北朝鲜的保证，和给予南朝鲜的许诺并没有矛盾的地方。”
    该报说：李承晚的指责，不免使人怀疑美国给朝中方面的保证，“是否像它应当表现的那么干脆明白”。该报说，世界上“很少看到过像美国政府所表现的那么可悲的公开愚蠢的表现”。
