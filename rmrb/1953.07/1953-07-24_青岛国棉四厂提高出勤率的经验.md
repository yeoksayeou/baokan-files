Editor's Note: The attendance rate of Qingdao State-Owned Fourth Cotton Textile Factory has consistently remained above 93% in the first five months of this year. The factory's equipment conditions are similar to other factories, and it added 20% new workers in the first half of this year. More than half of the factory's workers are women. The factory's experience in ensuring attendance rate is worth learning from.

    **Pay Attention to Health Education**

    Qingdao State-Owned Fourth Cotton Textile Factory conscientiously implemented the central government's medical policy of "prevention first, treatment second." The factory's Communist Party General Branch attached great importance to the leadership of the medical clinic, stipulating that the clinic's doctors should give workers in each shift an hour of health lessons every week, and helped the clinic's three doctors to divide the work. In the past, the factory's health propaganda was mainly aimed at workers, supplemented by family members, and the time for giving lessons to workers was limited. Now it has been changed to mainly aimed at family members, supplemented by workers, which not only maintained the time for giving lessons to workers, but also increased the time for giving lessons to family members. In the past, the content of the lessons was based on what diseases the workers had, but now it is based on the seasonal epidemic diseases, and propaganda is carried out in advance, which truly played a preventive role.

    Dr. Sun Hongzhang, who is responsible for health propaganda, is very serious. In addition to giving health lessons to male and female workers separately, he also gives special lectures to pregnant women. He gives the nursery's childcare workers a lecture on the common sense of infant care once a month, and often takes the opportunity of female workers feeding their children to give them health knowledge. When he lectured the cooks on the nutritional and hygienic knowledge of food, he also inspected the hygiene work of the canteen.

    Because he cares about the health of the workers, the workers respect him. Dr. Sun can also talk to the workers, ask them about their health, and the workers listen to Dr. Sun very much. For example, workers have developed a habit of paying attention to wearing clothes when leaving the workshop, so few people suffer from colds due to not paying attention to wearing clothes.

    Many textile workers suffer from gastrointestinal diseases, which have their roots. In the past, workers lived under reactionary rule for a long time, and were not allowed to turn off the machines when eating, so they ate sweet potato chips while watching the machines. Gradually, some workers simply didn't eat during working hours. As a result, many workers got gastrointestinal diseases. Even now, some workers have developed the habit of not wanting to eat during breaks in the shift. In addition, the factory's poor food service also affected the workers' eating. The factory's leadership focused on solving the problem of eating.

    First, the food service was rectified, and various inspection teams were established to help the food service improve its work. As a result, the workers gradually became satisfied with the food service. In addition, the trade union and the labor insurance and welfare department borrowed money from the family committee to set up a snack bar. This snack bar is located across from the factory gate, selling more than a dozen kinds of things such as sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, soy milk, wontons, noodles, and steamed buns, which are 20% cheaper than the market price. This solved the problem of workers eating when going to and from work. After solving this specific problem, the workers' eating became normal, which is of great benefit to their health.

    In addition, the doctor also told the workers about the harm of eating raw and cold things, so the workers no longer eat raw and cold things.

    **Ensure Workers' Rest and Do a Good Job in Mutual Assistance**

    Some workers did not get enough rest time, could not sleep well at night, and had no energy when they went to work the next day. They could not eat, and some even got sick from exhaustion.

    On the one hand, the factory's Party General Branch uniformly allocated after-work activity time, stipulating that after-work activities should not exceed two hours a day. On the other hand, the doctors were asked to analyze the importance of rest and sleep from the perspective of human physiology when giving health lessons. It was explained that textile workers have many tasks for work and study, so they must rest and sleep well in order to recover from fatigue. Insufficient sleep will increase the acid in the stomach, so they will not want to eat, and the body will not be able to support it. The workers were willing to listen to and easily accept this kind of explanation.

    The group's mutual assistance team also played a great role in protecting workers' health. If some workers were delayed in sleeping because of something at night, or if they were on their menstrual period, they only had to tell the group leader when they went to work, and the group leader would ask others to help her and reduce her work. Most of the workshops in this factory have such mutual assistance groups. For example, the fine spinning workshop's Huang Dejie group has established four mutual assistance groups. One rover who was pregnant, used to rove in the outer file, but everyone was afraid of touching her, so they let her rove in the inner file and removed a few less spindles. Worker Chen Keqing often dozed off when she was at work. When others asked her, she always said that the child made her unable to sleep. Later, after the mutual assistance group went to understand, her mother took good care of the child. It turned out that she was greedy to play and did not pay attention to sleeping. The mutual assistance group helped her with her thoughts, and when she went out to feed the child, everyone took special care of her machines. She was moved and never dozed off again when she was at work.

    The factory's dormitory is not enough now, and some workers live far away from the factory, so rainy and snowy days will affect their attendance. After research by the trade union and the administration, in this situation, they will send cars to pick them up or let them stay in the factory for a day to avoid workers from getting wet in the rain. Although this is only a temporary solution, it does solve some of the workers' difficulties and avoids workers' absenteeism.

    **Establish a Safety and Health Inspection Group**

    In addition to establishing a safety and health inspection committee, the factory also established a safety and health inspection group under the personal leadership of Deputy Director Li Xuezheng. The group includes representatives from the trade union, the engineer's office, the labor insurance and welfare department, the security department, the general affairs department, the carpentry shop, the ironwork department, and relevant departments. The problems found during the inspection belong to that department, and the representative of that department is responsible for urging the person in charge to solve them. Each workshop has also set up safety and health supervisors to be responsible for inspecting the safety and health work of their workshop.

    The inspection group is responsible for publicizing, inspecting, and solving safety and health problems. In the past, safety and health work was often done by holding large meetings and posting slogans everywhere, but it was over after a gust of wind. Now, with the safety and health inspection group, the work has become regular.

    The inspection group has studied the problems found in each inspection. If the problem can be solved in the workshop, it will notify the workshop director to solve it on the one hand, and write a note and paste it in the workshop director's office on the other hand, for the next inspection.

    The inspection group focused on helping the cleaning workshop, the power department, and the raw cotton finished product section to discuss and revise the safety operation procedures, and established a health regional system, so that everyone is responsible for health work in every place, maintaining safety and health, and reducing the causes of worker absenteeism.

    **Conduct Education on Labor Discipline**

    When formulating the production plan for the first quarter of this year, the factory's leadership combined it with education on strengthening labor discipline for the workers. It was explained to the workers the close relationship between completing the state production plan and completing the factory's, workshop's, group's, and individual's production plans. It was also explained that to complete the production plan, it is necessary to abide by labor discipline and ensure attendance rate. Female worker Sun Meixiang used to take frequent breaks. After this education on strengthening labor discipline, she said: "In the past, I didn't take breaks seriously, but now I know that the impact of taking a break is great. Not only is the individual production plan not guaranteed, but it will also affect the production plans of the group, the workshop, and even the country." Since then, she has not taken a single break.

    In the first half of this year, the factory added 20% new workers. These new workers were originally unemployed workers, farmers, and urban poor. Their thinking was very chaotic. Some were not accustomed to collective labor life, and some even thought that labor was "suffering." The factory leadership specially organized people, stipulated time, and conducted education for them, explaining the organization and discipline of the working class, talking about the beautiful future of national economic construction, the nature of state-owned enterprises, and the truth that labor creates the world. This gradually cleared up some of the chaotic thinking and stabilized the production mood.

    However, they were still not used to abiding by labor discipline. For example, during shift handover, the old workers entered the workshop 20 minutes early to check the machines, but some new workers saw that the old workers went to work early, so they left work early. Later, the factory leadership mobilized the old workers to sign apprenticeship contracts with them, and transferred some old workers to teach them the technology of watching machines. With the help of the old workers, they quickly improved their technical level and political awareness. Some new workers said: "The factory is really a united and friendly big family, and the working class is really a selfless class. We must work hard to create a happy life." So there were fewer people absent.

    **Improve Other Work and Improve Attendance Rate**

    If the nursery work is done well, it will play a great role in ensuring the attendance rate of mothers. The factory's Party General Branch appointed the organization committee member of the external workshop branch and the production committee member of the Communist Youth League to strengthen the ideological leadership of the nursery. Now the mothers are very satisfied with the nursery, and feel that putting their children in the nursery is better than taking care of them themselves. Sometimes when the children do not come to the nursery, the childcare workers will visit them at their homes.

    In the past, workers had to wait a long time to see a doctor at the clinic. Now a pre-registration method has been implemented to enable treatment work to be carried out in a planned manner. This way, workers don't have to wait a long time to see a doctor. The clinic has added eight beds, so workers with mild illnesses can rest quietly and recover quickly.

    In addition, the factory also pays attention to doing the work of comforting the sick, so that the sick can rest assured and recover as soon as possible. This also ensures the attendance rate.

### 青岛国棉四厂提高出勤率的经验

    青岛国棉四厂提高出勤率的经验
    编者按：国营青岛第四棉纺织厂今年头五个月的出勤率一直保持在百分之九十三以上。这个厂的各种设备条件，和别的厂差不多，今年上半年又增添了百分之二十的新工人，全厂有一半以上是女工。该厂保证出勤率的经验是值得学习的。
    注意进行卫生教育
    国营青岛第四棉纺织厂认真贯彻了中央关于“预防为主，治疗为辅”的医务方针。该厂共产党总支十分重视对医务室的领导，规定医务室大夫每星期要给各班工人讲一小时卫生课，并且帮助医务室的三个大夫分了工。过去，厂里进行卫生宣传的对象是以工人为主，家属为辅，而给工人讲课的时间是要受限制的；现在改变成以家属为主，工人为辅，就既保持了给工人讲课的时间，又增加了给家属讲课的时间。过去讲课的内容是工人生了甚么病就讲甚么，现在是根据季节的流行病，预先进行宣传，真正起了预防的作用。
    负责卫生宣传的孙鸿章大夫很认真，他除了给男工、女工分别讲卫生课外，还专门给怀孕的女工讲。他每月给托儿所的保育员讲一次护理婴儿的常识，又经常趁女工给孩子喂奶的机会，给她们讲卫生常识。他在给炊事员讲饮食的营养和卫生常识的时候，同时就检查食堂的卫生工作。
    因为他关心工人的健康，所以工人都尊敬他，孙大夫也跟工人谈得来，向工人问长问短，工人都很听孙大夫的话。如工人们对出车间注意穿衣服这点，已经都养成了一种习惯，所以很少有人因穿衣服不注意而患感冒的。
    纺织工人中有很多患肠胃病的，这种病是有它的根源的。过去，工人长期在反动统治下，吃饭的时候根本不准关车，一边吃地瓜干一边看着车，慢慢的有些工人在工作时间干脆就不吃饭了。这样，许多工人就得了肠胃病。直到现在，有些工人养成了习惯，在班上休息时间还是不愿意吃饭。另外，厂里伙食团搞得不好，也影响了工人吃饭。这个厂的领导方面就抓紧了解决吃饭的问题。
    首先整顿了伙食团，成立了各种检查组，帮助伙食团改进工作，这样，工人对伙食团渐渐满意了。此外，工会和劳保福利科又借钱给家属委员会，办了一个小吃部。这个小吃部就设在工厂大门的对过，卖烧饼、油条、豆浆、馄饨、面条、包子等十多种东西，价钱比市上便宜百分之二十，这样工人上班下班的吃饭问题就解决了。解决这个具体问题以后，工人吃饭正常了，对工人健康有很大好处。
    除此以外，大夫又对工人讲吃生凉东西的坏处，所以工人们也都不吃生凉的东西了。
        保证工人休息，搞好生活互助
    有些工人因为得不到充分的休息时间，晚上睡不好觉，第二天上班没有精神，饭也吃不下，有的甚至累病了。
    该厂党总支一方面统一分配了业余的活动时间，规定每天的业余活动不得超过两个钟头。另一方面，又请大夫在讲卫生课时，从人的生理上来分析休息和睡觉的重要性。说明纺织工人工作和学习的任务都很多，所以要好好休息和睡觉，才能恢复疲劳。睡觉不足，胃里的酸水增多了，就不爱吃饭，身体也支持不了。这样讲法工人愿意听，也容易接受。
    小组生活互助组，对保护工人身体健康也起了很大作用。有的工人因为晚上有事耽误了睡觉，或者是到了月经期，上班的时候只要向组长说一说，组长就会叫别人帮助她，减轻她的工作。这个厂大部分车间都有这样的互助组。像细纱车间黄德洁小组，就成立了四个互助小组。有一个落纱工怀孕了，她原来在外档落纱，大家怕碰着她，就让她到里档去落纱，并且少拔几个纱管。工人陈可卿上班时候常打盹，别人问她，她总说是孩子累的她睡不着觉，后来经过互助组去了解，她的母亲把孩子照顾得很好，原来是她自己贪玩不注意睡觉。互助组针对她的思想帮助她，并且在她出去奶孩子的时候，大家把她的车子看得特别好，她受了感动，从此上班再不打盹了。
    这个厂的宿舍现在还不够用，有些工人的家离厂比较远，下雨落雪天就会影响他们的出勤。经过工会和行政研究，碰到这种情况就派汽车接送，或者是留他们在厂里住一天，不叫工人淋雨。虽然这只是一个暂时解决问题的办法，但确实也解决了工人的一些困难，避免了工人缺勤。
    建立安全卫生检查小组
    这个厂除成立了安全卫生检查委员会以外，并且在副厂长李学正的亲自领导下，成立了安全卫生检查小组。参加这个小组的有：工会、工程师室、劳保福利科、保卫科、总务科、木工间、铁工部和有关部门的代表。检查出来的问题属于那个部门，就由那个部门的代表负责催促主管人解决。各车间也都设立了安全卫生干事，负责检查本车间的安全卫生工作。
    检查小组负责宣传、检查和解决安全卫生问题。过去搞安全卫生工作，经常是开大会，到处贴标语，但一阵风过去就完事了。现在有了安全卫生检查小组，就使工作经常化了。
    检查小组对每次检查出来的问题，都进行了研究。如果是车间里可以解决的问题，就一方面通知车间主任解决，一方面写一张纸条贴在车间主任的办公室里，以便下一次检查。
    检查小组重点帮助清花车间、原动部、原棉成品科三个部门，讨论和修订了安全操作规程，并建立了卫生区域制，使每个地方都有人负责卫生工作，保持了安全卫生，减少了造成工人缺勤的原因。
    进行劳动纪律的教育
    在制订今年第一季度生产计划时，这个厂的领导方面就结合着对工人进行了加强劳动纪律的教育。向工人说明完成国家生产计划和完成全厂的、车间的、小组的和个人的生产计划的密切关系。并且说明要完成生产计划，就要遵守劳动纪律，保证出勤率。女工孙美香过去常歇工，经过这次加强劳动纪律的教育以后，她说：“过去我不拿歇工当回事，现在才知道歇一个工的影响可大啦，不但个人生产计划没保证，还会影响小组、车间甚至国家的生产计划。”从此，她一个工再没歇。
    今年上半年，厂里增加了百分之二十的新工人。这些新工人，原来有的是失业工人，有的是农民，有的是城市贫民。他们的思想很混乱。有的不习惯集体的劳动生活，有的甚至认为劳动是“遭罪”。厂领导方面专门组织了人，规定了时间，向他们进行教育，说明工人阶级的组织性和纪律性，讲国家经济建设的美好前途，讲国营企业的性质，讲劳动创造世界的道理。这样渐渐地清除了一部分混乱思想，安定了生产情绪。
    但是，他们对遵守劳动纪律还是不习惯。例如交接班的时候，老工人提前二十分钟进车间检查机器，可是有些新工人看见老工人提前上班了，他就提前下班。后来，厂领导上发动老工人和他们订师徒合同，抽调一部分老工人专门教他们看车的技术。在老工人的帮助下，他们很快地提高了技术水平和政治觉悟。有的新工人就说：“工厂真是团结友爱的大家庭，工人阶级真是大公无私的阶级，我们一定要好好的干活，创造幸福的生活。”所以缺勤的人也就少了。
    改进其他工作，提高出勤率
    托儿所工作如果做得好，对保证母亲们的出勤率会起很大作用。这个厂党总支指定了外部车间支部的组织委员，和青年团的生产委员，加强托儿所的思想领导。现在母亲们对托儿所都很满意，觉得把孩子放在托儿所里比自己照顾的还好。有时候孩子没到托儿所来，保育员就到她们家里去访问。
    过去工人上医务室治病，要等很长时间。现在实行了预先挂号的办法，使治疗工作能有计划的进行。这样工人看病就不用等很长时间了。医务室增加了八张病床，轻病的工人可以安静地休息，很快就能恢复健康。
    另外，厂里也注意做慰问病号的工作，使病号安心休养，早日恢复健康。这样也保证了出勤率。
