    "Translation" Inaugural Issue Published
    The inaugural issue of "Translation" magazine, one of the publications of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers, was published in Beijing on July 1st.
    "Translation" is a magazine dedicated to publishing translations of literary works from various countries. The inaugural issue featured a foreword by the magazine's editor-in-chief, Mao Dun. He said: Twenty years ago, under the leadership of Mr. Lu Xun, a monthly magazine entitled "Translation" first appeared in China's literary world, and it had a tremendous impact on the revolutionary and progressive literary movements of the time. To commemorate Mr. Lu Xun's arduous establishment of "Translation" and to inherit its spirit, this newly published magazine is named "Translation." This publication will allow Chinese readers to feel more intimately from literary works the vigor and joy displayed by the working people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in building their beautiful lives and engaging in creative labor; it will also allow them to see more clearly how the people of capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries are bravely and firmly fighting for peace and democracy.
    The inaugural issue of "Translation" published excellent works by famous writers from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, India, Turkey, and other countries.

    PLA Troops stationed in Guangdong Assist People's Government in Establishing Seven Fishermen's Children Schools
    A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army guarding the frontline of coastal defense in a certain area of Guangdong Province has, in recent years, assisted the People's Government in establishing seven fishermen's children schools, with a total of more than 250 students. The unit has transferred a group of cultural instructors and soldiers with higher educational levels to serve as teachers. Unit cadres, soldiers, and fishermen worked together to find broken ship planks and rotten masts on the seashore to nail into desks, climbed high mountains to cut trees and harvest thatch to build schoolhouses, and used bamboo to weave benches. Lacking textbooks, the teachers cut steel plates and mimeographed them; some teachers copied the texts with brushes and distributed them to the students. The gales of the island often blew down the schoolhouses, and the soldiers rebuilt them again and again.
    In the beginning, the children by the sea were not used to sitting in school to study, and their parents often went out to sea to fish day and night and could not take care of them. The teachers would patiently mobilize the children to attend school together with the local People's Government, singing songs, telling stories, and dancing for them, slowly guiding the children to love attending school. The teachers also went to the fishing villages and boats during lunch and evening breaks to tutor the students, holding their hands and teaching them to write. Some teachers corrected homework late into the night.
    The students' academic performance is also very good. In the beginning, many people failed, but now the vast majority of students score above 70. They can sing many new songs and hold joint evening parties with the People's Liberation Army every Sunday. Some students in the third and fourth grades can already read newspapers and write letters. The students' parents are very grateful to the People's Liberation Army.
    Now, the residents of various islands are actively rebuilding school buildings and enriching school equipment, and the local People's Government is also transferring teachers from various places to strengthen the teaching work of these schools.

    Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, Trains Large Numbers of Midwives
    Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, has achieved good results in training midwives by using model practice and demonstration methods. Before the promotion of new midwifery methods in rural areas of Jieyang County, the infant mortality rate was very high. The county People's Government Health Institute and the county Democratic Women's Federation have jointly trained 1,192 midwives in 16 sessions from January last year to March this year, vigorously promoting new midwifery methods. In training midwives, in addition to explaining general physiological knowledge, they also used model practice and demonstrations to explain the new midwifery methods. The demonstration was performed by three instructors familiar with midwifery, playing the roles of midwife, pregnant woman, and family member, combining local customs to demonstrate the process of midwifery from the pregnant woman experiencing labor pains, the midwife preparing and disinfecting utensils, comforting the pregnant woman, explaining the benefits of the new midwifery method to the family, all the way to wrapping the baby's umbilical cord. After several performances, the trainees took turns rehearsing in groups. Using this method to train midwives, the trainees can master the basic techniques of new-method midwifery in seven or eight days. Because Jieyang County has trained a large number of midwives using new methods, the new midwifery method has been widely promoted in rural areas. According to statistics from February to the end of 1952, more than 6,900 babies were delivered using the new method in the county, and the mortality rate dropped to 2 per thousand, most of which were caused by premature birth or other reasons.

    Gansu Province Attaches Importance to Medical Work in Ethnic Minority Areas
    The Health Department of the Gansu Provincial People's Government attaches importance to health and medical work in ethnic minority areas. Recently, 15 health work teams have been successively dispatched to tour ethnic minority settlements and mixed-residence areas to treat diseases for the people of all ethnic groups. In addition to treating various diseases, the health work teams will also carry out medical and prevention work such as venereal disease prevention and treatment, and maternal and child health. The work teams carried a large number of medicines, instruments, and propaganda materials such as slides and health posters. The work teams will also train junior health personnel in ethnic minority areas and help local health departments establish prevention and treatment stations, midwifery stations, etc. Grassroots health institutions in various ethnic minority areas of Gansu Province are also gradually being established. At present, health institutes have been generally established in counties in ethnic minority areas, and health institutions below the county level have begun to be established since last year. This year, 107 health stations, midwifery stations, and district health clinics will continue to be established in various places. The medical personnel of these grassroots health institutions are being intensively trained by the Gansu Provincial People's Government Health Department and relevant health departments. Gansu Province has also decided to provide free medical treatment to ethnic minorities in pastoral and semi-pastoral areas this year, and to increase the number of free treatments in agricultural areas with ethnic minority settlements.

    “译文”创刊号出版
    中华全国文学工作者协会的机关刊物之一——“译文”杂志创刊号七月一日在北京出版。
    “译文”是专门刊载各国文学作品译文的刊物。创刊号上发表了该刊主编茅盾的发刊词。他说：二十年前，在鲁迅先生的领导下，题名为“译文”的月刊首次出现于我国文坛，它对于当时的革命的和进步的文学运动曾发生巨大影响。为了纪念鲁迅先生当年艰苦创办的“译文”并继承其精神，这新出的刊物即以“译文”命名。这刊物将使我国读者从文艺作品上更亲切地感受到苏联和人民民主国家的劳动人民在建设他们的美好生活，从事于创造性劳动时所表现的奋发和喜悦；也更真切地看到资本主义国家的和殖民地半殖民地的人民如何英勇而坚定地为和平为民主而斗争。
    “译文”这一期刊登了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、土耳其等著名作家的优秀作品。
    驻广东解放军协助人民政府举办了七所渔民子弟学校
    守卫在广东省某地海防前线的中国人民解放军某部，近年来协助人民政府先后举办了七所渔民子弟学校，共有学生二百五十多人。部队抽调了一批文化教员和文化水平较高的战士当教员。部队干部、战士和渔民一起到海滨寻找破船板、烂船桅，用来钉成书桌，攀上高山砍树木、割茅草搭成校舍，用竹子编织凳子。缺乏课本，教员就刻钢板、油印，有的教员用毛笔把课文抄下来发给学生。海岛的狂风常把校舍刮倒，战士们一次又一次地把它重搭起来。
    开始时，海边的孩子不习惯坐在学校里读书，他们的父母常日夜出海捕鱼无法照管，教员们就会同当地人民政府耐心地动员孩子入学，唱歌、讲故事给他们听，跳舞给他们看，慢慢地引导孩子喜爱入校读书。教员还在中午和黄昏等休息时间，分头到渔村、到船上给学生补习功课，把着孩子的手教孩子写字。有的教员修改作业到深夜。
    学生们的学习成绩也很好，开始有很多人不及格，现在绝大部分学生成绩都在七十分以上了。他们会唱许多新歌，每逢星期天就和解放军一起开联欢晚会。三、四年级的部分学生已能看报和写信。学生们的家长很感谢解放军。
    现在，各海岛居民正积极改建校舍和充实学校设备，当地人民政府也正从各地调派教员来加强这些学校的教学工作。
    广东省揭阳县训练大批接生员
    广东省揭阳县在训练接生员中运用模型实习和表演的方法，效果良好。揭阳县农村在推广新接生法以前，婴儿死亡率很高，该县人民政府卫生院和该县民主妇女联合会自去年一月到今年三月，联合训练了十六次接生员共一千一百九十二人，大力推广新接生法。在训练接生员中，他们除讲解一般生理常识外，还用模型实习和表演来讲解新接生法。表演是由三个熟悉接生业务的辅导员分演接生员、产妇和家人，结合当地风俗习惯，表演孕妇发生阵痛后，接生员从准备和消毒用具、安慰产妇、向家属讲解新接生法的好处，一直到包扎婴儿脐带等接生的过程。表演几次后，学员们分组轮流演习。用这种方法训练接生员，学员们七八天就可掌握新法接生的基本技术。揭阳县由于采用新的方法训练了大批接生员，在农村中普遍推行新接生法。据一九五二年二月到年底的统计，该县用新法接生的婴儿有六千九百多个，死亡率降至千分之二，且大部分是早产或其他原因造成。
    甘肃省重视少数民族地区的医疗工作
    甘肃省人民政府卫生厅重视少数民族地区的卫生医疗工作。最近陆续派出十五个卫生工作队，前往少数民族聚居地区和杂居地区巡回，给各族人民治疗疾病。卫生工作队除治疗各种疾病外，并将进行性病防治、妇幼卫生等医防工作。工作队携带了大量药品、器械和幻灯片、卫生挂图等宣传品。工作队还将在少数民族地区训练初级卫生人员和帮助当地卫生工作部门建立防治站、接生站等。甘肃省各少数民族地区的基层卫生机构，也逐步在建立中。现在，少数民族地区各县的卫生院已普遍建立，县以下的卫生机构，从去年起已开始建立。今年各地将继续建立一百零七处保健站、接生站和区卫生所。这些基层卫生机构的医务人员，甘肃省人民政府卫生厅和有关卫生部门正在加紧培养中。甘肃省还决定今年在牧区、半牧区，全部免费给少数民族人民治病，在少数民族聚居的农业区也要增加免费人数。
