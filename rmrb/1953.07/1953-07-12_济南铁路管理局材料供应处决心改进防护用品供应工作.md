Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    A letter from Wan Hai, Deputy Director of the Materials Supply Department of the Jinan Railway Bureau: The report on June 8th published readers' criticism of our department for not actively supplying protective equipment to employees. After our review, we found that we did indeed treat this work with a bureaucratic attitude.

    In the past, labor protection equipment was not within the scope of material supply. This year, when this task was to be handed down, our leadership lacked an overall perspective, neglected safety in production, and was unwilling to accept it. After various units raised their opinions, the Bureau consulted with the Ministry of Railways and only then decided that it would be under our department's responsibility from the second quarter onwards, and application and supply methods were announced in late February. Because the decision was made late, it affected planning and material preparation.

    After accepting this task, we did not thoroughly study how to complete it. For example, raincoats and work clothes, among the labor protection equipment, were needed in large quantities and should have been handled by our department in a unified manner; however, we did not consider this issue. First, we assigned the task to the factories, then entrusted the general factory to handle it on our behalf, and finally let the factories handle it themselves or request the units to handle it on their behalf. This unclear division of labor, with no one specifically responsible, affected the time for material preparation. In addition, we lacked supervision and inspection after assigning the work, and some entrusted orders were held up for a month before being returned, which further affected the supply work.

    The above situation is the reason for the untimely supply of labor protection equipment by our department. We are determined to accept this lesson. In addition to urging the factories to complete the unfinished supply work for the second quarter and sending personnel to conduct in-depth inspections to urge the factories to prepare for the supply work for the third quarter, we must strengthen the planning of supply work in the future.

### 济南铁路管理局材料供应处决心改进防护用品供应工作

    济南铁路管理局材料供应处决心改进防护用品供应工作
    济南铁路管理局材料供应处副处长万海来信：六月八日报上刊载了读者批评我处不积极供应职工防护用品。经我们检查，我们确是以官僚主义态度对待这一工作的。
    过去，劳动保护用品不属于材料供应范围。今年这个任务要交下时，我们的领导方面缺乏整体观点，忽视安全生产，不愿接受。经各单位提出意见，管理局请示铁道部后才确定自第二季度起划归我处负责，于二月下旬公布了申请和供应办法。因决定较迟，就影响了计划和备料工作。
    我们在接受了这个任务后，并没有切实研究怎样完成这一任务。如劳动保护用品中雨衣和工作服等需要数量较多，应由我处统筹办理；但我们却没有考虑这个问题，先是交各厂去办，后又委托总厂代办，最后又让各厂自办或洽请各单位代办。这样分工不明，各无专责，就影响了备料工作的时间。加上我们布置工作后缺乏督促和检查，有些委托单积压了一月之久又退了回来，更影响了供应工作。
    以上情况，就是我处劳动保护用品供应不及时的原因。我们决心接受这一教训，除督促各厂抓紧完成第二季度未完成的供应工作并派员深入检查督促各厂作好第三季度的供应准备工作外，更要在今后加强供应工作的计划性。
