    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 28th: At 22:00 on July 27th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army armed forces faithfully carried out the armistice order of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, and completely ceased all military actions on the more than 240-kilometer front line in Korea.
    In the area south of JinCheng, there was still a fierce battle at dusk. But by 22:00, the front was completely silent in the hazy moonlight. The fierce sounds of gunfire suddenly stopped, and the fire from artillery shell explosions and gunshots disappeared. On our army's positions, soldiers, wearing the "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative badge and various medals and honors awarded by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, came out of their fortifications. With joy and excitement, they welcomed the arrival of the glorious armistice.
    In the Shangganling area of the Korean central front, the enemy and our side were still firing fiercely at each other five minutes before the ceasefire. At 22:00, the gunfire suddenly died down. Our army was the first to comply with the effective time of the ceasefire and stopped all combat operations. Gunners ceased firing. Snipers under "Sniper Ridge" emerged from their shooting platforms. Infantry soldiers came out of the tunnels, and in the glare of the flashlights, they raised their weapons and cheered, "Long live peace!"
    As soon as our army's combat operations ceased, the enemy's searchlights immediately went out. Then, enemy soldiers boldly crawled out of their dark bunkers and lit torches. From the light of the torches, our soldiers could clearly see many enemy soldiers throwing away their rifles and tank crew members climbing out of their turrets. They laughed together, congratulating each other that they would no longer lose their lives in this meaningless war for them.
    On the "Heartbreak Ridge" positions on the eastern front, the rumbling of artillery fire and the crisp sound of gunfire had been echoing only two hours earlier. At 22:00, the oral order was issued level by level from the telephones in our army's organizations: "Ceasefire!" "Ceasefire!" Then, loud bugle calls and joyful cheers from the soldiers echoed across the battlefield. But they still held their weapons and did not relax their vigilance against the enemy in the slightest.

    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 28th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are strictly abiding by the Korean Armistice Agreement and rapidly carrying out the work of withdrawing from the demilitarized zone. The command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops on the JinCheng front, after receiving the armistice order from Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on the 27th, began to formulate a plan for withdrawing from the demilitarized zone, carefully arranged the withdrawal time for each unit, and planned the rearward transportation of grain, ammunition, and supplies in order to withdraw from the demilitarized zone on time. At the same time, the command ordered all commanders and fighters to maintain a high degree of vigilance to prevent the other side from taking any possible destructive actions. Although our army's positions on the JinCheng front had not been occupied for long, due to our army's sufficient supplies, the amount of grain, ammunition, and various items in storage was still very large. The logistics department is organizing various means of transportation to move these supplies out of the demilitarized zone in succession.
    The commanders of our army on the Shangganling front went to the front-line positions after receiving the ceasefire order to personally direct the troops in preparing to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. This area of ​​positions was only occupied in the recent counterattack, and it was full of ammunition and various supplies discarded by the enemy. The soldiers are actively cleaning up, preparing for rearward transportation. At the same time, the soldiers have begun to clear dangerous objects and obstacles in the demilitarized zone, and loud explosions are heard from the positions from time to time. On the edge of the demilitarized zone, many soldiers are busy setting up signs written in both Korean and Chinese.
    Our army troops on the western front are also making preparations for withdrawal in full swing. Our army has stored several months' worth of grain and ammunition on the positions in front of Maliang Mountain, but thanks to careful organization, these supplies can all be withdrawn from the demilitarized zone within twenty hours.
    On the "Heartbreak Ridge" front, the commanders of the Korean People's Army held a meeting at 10:00 PM on the 27th after the ceasefire to study the troop withdrawal, so as to withdraw from the demilitarized zone on time. The soldiers raised the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on "Heartbreak Ridge" and nearby positions and erected huge banners with the words "Resolutely implement the Armistice Agreement." The soldiers are busily preparing for the withdrawal. The unit has established more than a dozen command posts on the planned withdrawal route to direct the troops to withdraw in succession.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 28th: The command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army front-line troops in Kaesong is strictly abiding by the Korean Armistice Agreement and is rapidly carrying out various tasks for withdrawing from the demilitarized zone. The command of the Kaesong front-line troops has dispatched many staff officers to the front-line positions to assist commanders at all levels in carrying out the withdrawal work. The sound of explosives is heard all day long on our army's positions that are about to be withdrawn from the demilitarized zone, and many fortifications have been leveled. Today, from 11:00 to 18:00, our army completed all the work of setting up markers on the northern edge of the demilitarized zone along the west bank of the Sajiawan River on both sides of Panmunjom in accordance with the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The markers are T-shaped wooden signs, the sign body is one meter long and half a meter wide, the pillar is one and a half meters high and half a meter is buried in the ground, and the words "Northern Edge of the Demilitarized Zone" are written on the sign in Korean and Chinese. One is set up every 250 meters.
    At the same time, in order to facilitate and safely conduct the work of the Military Armistice Commission's Joint Observation Team in the demilitarized zone, the Kaesong front-line troops repaired a three-kilometer-long highway within a few hours after the ceasefire. Combat engineers cleared many dangerous objects in the demilitarized zone and set up markers around some dangerous areas that could not be cleared temporarily.

    朝中人民部队严格遵守朝鲜停战协定
    迅速进行撤离非军事区的工作
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】七月二十七日二十二时正，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军武装部队切实执行了金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的停战命令，在朝鲜前线二百四十多公里长的正面战线上完全停止了一切军事行动。
    在金城以南地区，黄昏时还有过一场激烈的战斗。但到二十二时正，在朦胧的月光下前线完全处在静寂中。猛烈的枪炮声骤然停止了，炮弹爆炸和枪弹出口的火光消失了。在我军的阵地上，战士们佩带起抗美援朝纪念章、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府赠予的各种奖章和勋章走出工事来。他们怀着愉快、喜悦的心情，迎接光荣停战的到来。
    朝鲜中线上甘岭地区在停火前五分钟，敌我双方还相互发射着猛烈的炮火。二十二时正，枪炮声突然沉寂下来。我军首先遵守停火生效时间停止了一切战斗行动。炮手们停止了射击。“狙击兵岭”下的狙击手们走出射击台。步兵战士们走出坑道，在一道道手电筒光的闪耀中，高举武器欢呼“和平万岁！”
    在我军的战斗行动刚停止的时候，敌军的探照灯立即熄灭了。接着，敌军士兵就大胆地钻出了阴暗的地堡，点燃起火把。从火把的光亮中，我军战士们可以清楚地看到许多敌军的士兵扔掉了步枪，坦克手们钻出了炮塔。他们在一起欢笑，相互庆幸他们不会再在这个对他们毫无意义的战争中丧失生命了。
    东线“伤心岭”阵地上在两小时以前还响着隆隆的炮声和清脆的枪声。二十二时正，我军各级组织逐级从电话里下达了口头命令：“停火！”“停火！”接着，战场上响起了嘹亮的号声和战士们愉快的欢呼声。但他们仍握着武器，没有丝毫放松对敌人的警惕。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军严格遵守朝鲜停战协定，迅速进行撤出非军事区的工作。金城前线中国人民志愿军部队的指挥机关，在二十七日接到金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的停战命令以后，就着手制订撤出非军事区的方案，周密地安排了各部队撤离的时间，筹划了粮弹物资的后运，以便准时撤出非军事区。同时，该指挥机关命令全体指战员保持高度的警惕，以防对方采取任何可能的破坏行为。金城前线我军阵地虽然占领未久，但是由于我军供应充足，积存的粮食、弹药和各种物品的数目仍很庞大。后勤部门正在组织各种运输工具，把这些物资陆续运出非军事区。
    上甘岭前线的我军指挥员们接到停战命令后，就到前线阵地亲自指挥部队进行撤出非军事区前的准备工作。这一带阵地是在最近的反击战中才占领的，到处是敌人丢弃的弹药和各种物资，战士们正在积极进行清理，准备后运。与此同时，战士们已开始清除非军事区内的危险物和障碍物，阵地上不时发出一声声爆炸的巨响。在非军事区的边缘，许多战士正在忙着设置写着朝中两国文字的标志。
    西线我军部队也在紧张地进行撤离的准备工作。我军在马良山前线阵地上储存了几个月的粮食和弹药，但是由于组织周密，这些物资在二十个小时内就可以全部撤出非军事区。
    在“伤心岭”前线，朝鲜人民军各部指挥员在二十七日下午十时停火以后就举行会议，研究部队后撤事宜，以便准时撤出非军事区。战士们在“伤心岭”及附近阵地上升起朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗，和竖立了写着“坚决执行停战协定”字样的巨幅标语。战士们正在忙碌地进行后撤的准备工作。该部在预定后撤的道路上已设立了十多个指挥站，指挥部队陆续后撤。
    【新华社开城二十八日电】中国人民志愿军开城前线部队指挥机关正严格遵守朝鲜停战协定，迅速进行撤离非军事区的各项工作。开城前线部队指挥机关已派出了许多参谋人员前往前沿阵地协助各级指挥员进行撤离工作。即将撤离非军事区的我军阵地上整日轰响着炸药的爆破声，许多工事已被平毁。今天从十一时到十八时，我军按照朝鲜停战协定的规定，全部完成了在板门店中立区两侧沿砂川河西岸的非军事区北缘设置标志物的工作。标志物是丁字形木牌，牌身横长一公尺、宽半公尺，立柱一公尺半、下埋入土半公尺，牌上用朝鲜文和中文写着“非军事区北缘”字样。每隔二百五十公尺设置一个。
    同时，为了使军事停战委员会联合观察小组在非军事区内方便而且安全地进行工作，开城前线部队在停火后数小时内修复了一条长三公里的公路。工兵们在非军事区内清除了许多危险物，在一些暂时未能清除的危险地区的周围设置了标志。
