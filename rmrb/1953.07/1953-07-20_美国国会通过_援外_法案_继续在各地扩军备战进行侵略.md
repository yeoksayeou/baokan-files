    U.S. Congress Passes "Foreign Aid" Bill
    Continuing to Expand Armaments and Prepare for War and Conduct Aggression in Various Regions
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] The U.S. Congress finally passed a "foreign aid" bill on the 13th. This bill is a compromise of the bills previously passed by the two houses, authorizing the government to spend more than $5,157 million in foreign "aid" funds in the new fiscal year beginning July 1 this year.
    This fund will mainly be used to continue expanding armaments and preparing for war in Europe and the Far East, and to intensify France's colonial war in Vietnam.
    During the discussion of the "foreign aid" bill, there were fierce debates in both houses of Congress. Some congressmen demanded a reduction in the amount of "foreign aid" appropriations, expressing disappointment with the results of U.S. "foreign aid" to date and concerns about the large government budget deficit; but most congressmen believed that, despite the huge budget deficit, any large reduction in "foreign aid" appropriations would affect the United States' global expansion of armaments and war preparations plans, so they supported Eisenhower's request to maintain a large amount of "foreign aid" funds.

    美国国会通过“援外”法案
    继续在各地扩军备战进行侵略
    【新华社十八日讯】美国国会两院于十三日最后通过一个“援外”法案。这个法案是两院前此分别通过的法案的折衷，授权政府在今年七月一日开始的新财政年度内开支五十一亿五千七百多万美元的对外“援助”款项。
    这笔款项主要将用于在欧洲和远东继续进行扩军备战并加紧法国在越南的殖民战争。
    国会两院在讨论“援外”法案时，曾发生激烈的辩论。一部分议员要求削减“援外”拨款数目，他们表示了对美国“援外”迄今的收获的失望，并担忧政府预算赤字的庞大；但大部分议员认为，尽管预算已有巨大赤字，但任何“援外”款项的大量削减，将会使得美国全球性的扩军备战计划受到影响，因此他们支持艾森豪威尔保持大量“援外”款项的要求。
