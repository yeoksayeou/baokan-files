    Battle Friendship Dam
    Xiao Qiufēi, Lián Xiángzhōu
    In May of this year, a water dam appeared on the Gǔshān River in Lóngyán Village, Gǔshān County, northern Korea. On the dam stands a monument with the words "Battle Friendship Dam" engraved in both Korean and Chinese on the front. On the back is engraved: "In memory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's meritorious service in building the dam, this monument is erected as a commemoration." Among the Korean people in this area, a song called "Flower of Friendship" praising this dam is circulating:
    "Rolling water, high dam;
    Green seedlings, joyful home.
    Large wooden stakes stained with the blood pierced by your hands,"
    A magnificent dam blossoms with the flowers of friendship.
    …
    Our dear ones, the Volunteer Army,
    The monument is inscribed with "Battle Friendship Dam."
    Our descendants will engrave it in their hearts for generations,
    Pine trees and flowing water will sing your deeds year after year!"
    The Gǔshān River is a tributary of the Dàtóng River, flowing from Dōngshān Village in Gǔshān County through Lóngyán Village and Bǐngqiú Village into the Dàtóng River. It is one of the larger rivers within Gǔshān County. Its current is very rapid, with an average flow rate of four meters per second. For decades, the people of Lóngyán Village had hoped to build a dam to divert the water of the Gǔshān River to the fields for irrigation. Eighty-four-year-old farmer Jīn Xìnglóng said, "When I was a child, I heard that if a dam were built there, our lives would be better." However, due to the long period of national liberation struggle for the Korean people, and when they began to live a happy life after the liberation of northern Korea, the American invaders launched the Korean War. Therefore, this dam could never be built. Local farmers could only勉力build a temporary dam to block water for irrigation during spring plowing. But when the rainy season came, mountain torrents erupted, and the temporary dam was washed away without a trace. Last year, the people of Lóngyán Village had to convert 20,000 píng of rice paddy into dry land due to lack of water.
    In the spring of 1953, the people of Lóngyán Village encountered water shortage difficulties again. Some people were planning to painfully convert other rice paddies into dry land.
    At this time, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came to the vicinity of Lóngyán Village. The soldiers were very concerned about this major issue related to the lives of the Korean people and were determined to help the Korean people solve the problem of water shortage. They jointly conducted surveys and designs with the local Korean government and decided to build a 36-meter-long dam to reduce the impact of the rapid current; a 65-meter-long overflow dam, so that when mountain torrents erupted during the rainy season, the water could overflow the dam and avoid flooding; a 10-meter-long diversion dam to allow the water to flow obediently into the canal for irrigation; and a sluice gate to control the water volume; and dredge a 650-meter-long canal. After the completion of these projects, not only would the existing 20,000 píng of rice paddy in Lóngyán Village be fully irrigated, and the 20,000 píng of rice paddy converted into dry land last year be restored, but also 60,000 to 70,000 píng of dry land could be converted into rice paddy in the next three years. To carry out this project, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the local Korean government jointly organized a special construction headquarters, installed telephones, and started work on International Labor Day "May 1" this year.
    On the day the work started, the people of the five villages along the Gǔshān River were stirred up. The elderly with crutches, women carrying children, and children holding flowers all flocked to the construction site. Jīn Xìnglóng, who was eighty-four years old, had not been out for three years. Hearing that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was building a dam, he happily got up early in the morning and went to the construction site with his crutches. He said:
    "I must go and see the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Because of his age and weakness, he walked one and a half lǐ in five hours, resting seventy-two times in between. After arriving at the construction site, he patted a Volunteer Army soldier on the shoulder and said with infinite joy, "Our decades of hope have been realized by you. This is the happiness of our future generations."
    At the construction site, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers were working selflessly under the slogan "Commemorate 'May 1' and benefit the Korean people." They braved the heavy rain and worked in shifts day and night. The shoulders of those carrying stones were swollen, and their hands and feet were broken, but they still sang the songs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Yáng Xiùmíng, a second-class merit recipient, had malaria and, after just a bout of chills and fever, rushed to move stones. The mornings in northern Korea in May were still very cold, but the soldiers jumped into the one-meter-deep icy river water to work in order to build the overflow dam. Soldier Chén Ziliáng said, "Luo Shengjiao jumped into an ice hole in winter to save the Korean boy Cui Ying, I want to learn from him!" He was the first to take off his clothes and jump into the water. Then, many soldiers followed suit. Their bodies were numb with cold in the water, but they still insisted on working. During the construction, the soldiers made 290 carrying baskets, eight large rammers, fifteen wooden hammers, and ninety shoulder poles, and found ways to improve the efficiency of transporting and sawing wood.
    Groups of Korean women also participated in carrying stones at the construction site, and the children followed behind their mothers, happily running with a small stone on their heads. They sometimes also offered flowers to the soldiers who were working hard in the water. Many elderly people also voluntarily participated in building the dam. The chairmen of the People's Committee of Gǔshān County and Lóngyán Village also often came to the construction site. Male and female students from the Eleventh Middle School of Gǔshān County and Lóngyán Village Elementary School also sang songs and performed dances for the soldiers during their rest time. Sixty-nine-year-old Jiāng Wényīng went to fish upstream every morning. He fried the fish he caught and gave them to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers who were building the dam.
    The dam construction was quickly completed. At twelve noon on May 9, a ceremony was held to celebrate the completion of the dam. Amid thunderous applause, the chairman of the People's Committee of Gǔshān County cut the colored silk, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers opened the wooden sluice gate. The clear water of the Gǔshān River flowed quietly through the canal into the dry rice fields. Immediately, cheers resounded through the valley, and people shouted in Korean and Chinese: "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live the solidarity of the Chinese and Korean people!" Then, many Korean women took flowers and presented them to every Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier who built the dam. Eighty-four-year-old Korean elder Jiāng Jīsūn danced with excitement. He said, "I haven't danced for many years, but this matter is really too happy." The old women also started dancing, and the Volunteer Army soldiers also started dancing. Everyone danced and sang to their heart's content, celebrating the completion of the dam! Praising the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    战斗友谊坝
    肖秋非  廉详周
    今年五月，在朝鲜北部谷山郡龙岩里的谷山川上，出现了一条下水坝，水坝上立有一座纪念碑，碑的正面用朝中两国文字刻着“战斗友谊坝”五个字，碑的背面刻着：“为纪念中国人民志愿军兴修水坝的功勋，特立此碑，以志纪念”。在这一带的朝鲜人民中流传着一支名叫“友谊之花”的颂扬这条水坝的歌子：
    “滚滚的流水，高高的坝；
    青青的秧苗，欢笑的家。
    大木桩上染着你们双手刺破的血，”
    雄壮的坝上开出了友谊的花。
    ……
    我们的亲人志愿军哪，
    纪念碑上刻着“战斗友谊坝”。
    我们子孙万代还要刻在心坎上，
    松柏流水要把你们的事迹年年歌唱！”
    谷山川是大同江的支流，从谷山郡东山里经龙岩里，炳逑里流入大同江，是谷山郡境内较大的河流之一。它的水流很急，流速平均每秒钟四公尺。几十年来，龙岩里人民就希望能修筑一道水坝，使谷山川的水流向田野，灌溉土地。八十四岁的老农民金兴龙说：“我小时候就听说，如果在那里修道水坝，我们的日子就会好些。”但是，由于朝鲜人民长时期的处于民族解放斗争中，当朝鲜北部解放以后，他们开始过着幸福生活的时候，美国侵略者又发动了侵朝战争，因此，这条水坝始终未能修成。当地的农民只能在春耕时勉力修一个临时水坝拦水灌田。但一到雨季，山洪爆发，临时水坝就被冲得没有影子了。去年，龙岩里人民就因为缺水，把两万坪水稻田改成了旱田。
    一九五三年的春天，龙岩里人民又遇到了缺水的困难。有些人又打算忍痛把其他的水稻田改成旱田。
    这时，中国人民志愿军某部来到了龙岩里附近。战士们都很关心这个有关朝鲜人民生活的重大问题，决心帮助朝鲜人民解决缺水的困难。他们与当地朝鲜政府共同进行勘测和设计，决定修一条三十六公尺长的拦水坝，以减弱急流的冲击力量；修一条六十五公尺长的漫水坝，雨季山洪爆发时大水可漫坝而过，不致造成涝灾；修一条十公尺长的顺坝，使水驯服地流入渠道，灌溉田地；另外还要修一座控制水量的水闸；疏浚一条六百五十公尺长的水渠。这些工程完成以后，不仅使龙岩里现有的两万坪水稻田能得到充分的灌溉，使去年因缺水改成旱田的两万坪水稻田复原，并且能在今后三年内将六、七万坪旱田改为水稻田。为进行这个工程，中国人民志愿军与当地朝鲜政府共同组织了专门的施工指挥所，架上电话，在今年“五一”国际劳动节开工。
    开工的那天，谷山川沿岸五个村庄的人民都轰动起来了。扶着拐杖的老年人，背着孩子的妇女和抱着鲜花的儿童都拥向了工地。八十四岁的金兴龙已经三年没有出门了，听说中国人民志愿军修水坝，高兴得一清早起来就拄着拐杖到工地去。他说：
    “我一定要去看看中国人民志愿军。”他因为年迈体弱，一里半的路程走了五个钟头，中间休息了七十二次。到工地以后，他拍拍一个志愿军战士的肩膀无限欣喜地说：“我们几十年来的愿望由你们给实现了。这是我们子孙万代的幸福。”
    工地上，中国人民志愿军战士们在“纪念‘五一’，为朝鲜人民造福”的口号下，忘我地劳动着。他们冒着大雨，日夜轮班地干。抬石头的人肩头压肿了，手脚碰破了，还高唱着中国人民志愿军战歌。二等功臣杨秀明患疟疾，刚发过一阵寒热，就抢着去搬石头。五月朝鲜北部的早晨还是很冷的，但战士们为了修漫水坝，便跳进一公尺深的冰凉的河水里去工作。战士陈子良说：“罗盛教为了抢救朝鲜少年崔?，冬天还往冰窟窿里跳呢，我要向他学习！”他第一个脱掉衣服跳下水去，接着，许多战士也跟着跳下水去。他们在水里身子都冻得发麻了，还坚持工作。在修建中，战士们制作了二百九十个抬筐，八个大夯，十五个木锤，九十根扁担，并想办法提高了运木材和锯木材的效率。
    成群结队的朝鲜妇女也在工地上参加搬石头的工作，小孩子们便跟在他们的母亲的后面，顶着一块小石头快活地跑着。他们有时还给在水里紧张工作的战士们献花。许多老人也自动参加修坝。谷山郡和龙岩里的人民委员会委员长也常到工地上来。谷山郡第十一中学和龙岩里小学的男女学生们也趁战士们休息的时间为他们演唱歌曲和表演舞蹈。六十九岁的老人姜文英，每天早晨到河的上游去钓鱼，他把钓来的鱼煎好，送给修坝的中国人民志愿军战士吃。
    筑坝工程很快地完成了。五月九日中午十二点钟，举行水坝落成典礼。在雷鸣般的掌声里，谷山郡人民委员会委员长剪断了彩绸、中国人民志愿军战士打开了木制的水闸，谷山川的清水通过水渠静静地流进了干涸的稻田里。顿时欢呼声响彻山谷，人们用朝鲜话和中国话高喊：“金日成元帅万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”“中朝人民团结万岁！”接着，许多朝鲜妇女拿着鲜花献给修筑水坝的每一个中国人民志愿军战士。八十四岁的朝鲜老人姜基淳兴奋得跳起舞来。他说：“我已经多年不跳舞了，但这件事实在叫人太高兴了。”老大娘们也跳起舞来了，志愿军战士也跳起舞来了。大家尽情地跳啊，唱啊，庆祝水坝的落成！歌颂中国人民和朝鲜人民之间的深厚友谊。　（新华社）
