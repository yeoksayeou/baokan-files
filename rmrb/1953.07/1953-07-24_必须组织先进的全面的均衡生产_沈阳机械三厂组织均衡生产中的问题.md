    Must Organize Advanced, Comprehensive, and Balanced Production
    ——Problems in Organizing Balanced Production at Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant
    Song Zheng

    Since the third quarter of 1951, the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant has been learning from Soviet advanced experiences and organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts. Over the past year, it has achieved significant results. In 1952, the plant's output increased more than twofold compared to 1951, product quality and labor productivity significantly improved, and costs decreased. By the end of the fourth quarter of 1952, the plant was basically able to complete the daily production of lathes, with the equilibrium rate of the assembly workshop reaching around 90%. However, this does not mean that the plant's planning and management are perfect. The plant's plans often have a certain degree of conservatism; although the equilibrium rate of commodity production is very high, the equilibrium rate of parts production is not high enough, the processing workshops do not complete their daily plans well enough, and some problems that occur in production and management are not resolved quickly enough. All of this prevents the plant's potential from being more fully realized. The failure to overcome these shortcomings in a timely manner is related to the fact that the plant, from top to bottom (including the Party organization and the trade union), has begun to consciously or unconsciously develop a certain degree of complacency and conservatism.

    The Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant's complacency is first manifested in its lack of sensitivity to the problems that occur in balanced production. It is satisfied to a certain extent with the higher equilibrium rate of the assembly workshop, without paying attention to the overall equilibrium of production. Last year, the plant experienced an excessive and unbalanced accumulation of reserves and in-process inventory. By the end of October last year, the parts, materials, and semi-finished products accumulated in the second and third workshops amounted to about 200 sets (by the end of last year, the plant's lathe production only reached about 100 sets per month). Moreover, the stocked parts and the semi-finished products in the workshops were very unbalanced. The second workshop had to process 205 types of parts. At that time, 50 types had not reached the target, including 2 types that were short by 200 sets, 11 types that were short by more than 100 sets, and 139 types that exceeded the target, including 7 types that exceeded by more than 100 sets, with the difference between the maximum and minimum reaching 404 sets. The same was true for the third workshop, where the difference between the maximum and minimum reached more than 570 sets. There was also an excessive and unbalanced accumulation of semi-finished products circulating within the processing workshops. At that time, the number of parts accumulated in the processes in the second and third processing workshops ranged from 50 sets to more than 200 sets. The workers called this situation "big belly." That is to say, during this period, although the equilibrium rate of the assembly workshop was very high, the equilibrium was not advanced enough or comprehensive enough. The accumulation and imbalance of parts and work in process resulted in a waste of production capacity and an accumulation of funds. Just calculated on the basis of material costs, more than 1.3 billion yuan of funds were accumulated at that time, which was a manifestation of insufficient planning in production management.

    There were many reasons for this situation. In addition to the large number of lathe repairs due to quality remediation, which relatively weakened the strength of the assembly workshop, and the increased difficulty of tool supply due to higher quality requirements, the main reasons were as follows: First, the strength of the processing workshops gradually grew, exceeding that of the assembly workshop, but the leadership did not take effective measures in time to break through this weak link in the assembly workshop. It was not until the problem of parts accumulation had become quite serious that the assembly workshop adopted the method of specialized division of labor to improve labor productivity. Second, when the production section determined the monthly operation plan targets, it only issued the targets in terms of complete sets, resulting in more and more parts that exceeded the target last month, and parts that did not complete the task last month becoming even more difficult to complete. At the same time, the production section always invested more materials and requested fewer tasks. On the one hand, this was because the scrap rate could not be controlled, and on the other hand, it was also due to the mistaken belief that doing so could prevent the processing workshops from being "threatened" by the assembly workshop, so as to avoid breaking the equilibrium. In October of last year, the cumulative number of materials invested and the cumulative number of tasks requested differed by as much as 70 sets. Third, the internal production organization of the processing workshops could not adapt to the needs of plan management, which also brought great difficulties to the workshops in preparing and executing operation plans. When starting to organize rhythmic production, the plant had fixed machine tools, fixed workers, and fixed workpieces in the processing workshops. Later, it divided the groups according to the type of workpiece, and organized the same type of workpiece to be produced in one group. After these improvements, the workers' operations became specialized, saving tools and templates, and the technology became easier to master, increasing labor productivity by about 30%. However, at this time, the sections in the processing workshops were still organized according to the nature of the machine tools. Almost every part needed to go through several sections such as turning, planing, milling, etc. to be completely processed. The road traveled by the parts was very long, and the auxiliary production time took up too much. At the same time, one section only managed one process, and the processes could not be connected. The section chief was not responsible for the entire production process of the parts. This kind of production organization made it necessary for the planners in the workshop to organize hundreds of parts and hundreds of processes to each machine tool and each worker from beginning to end when preparing the operation plan. Therefore, the time for preparing the plan was very long. At the same time, it was difficult to ensure that there would be no mistakes when such a huge and complicated task was concentrated on one person. In the process of executing the plan, it was also difficult for the dispatchers to grasp the flow of parts between the processes, which weakened the role of the dispatching work in ensuring the realization of the operation plan. The plant sometimes did not learn from the advanced experiences of other plants humbly enough. The specialized sections in the processing workshops and the specialized division of labor in the assembly workshops were advanced experiences that other factories had already created. The plant did not organize learning for quite a long time, and individual leaders even doubted the effectiveness of these advanced experiences. The plant was also not sensitive enough to these problems in production at that time. This situation did not change until the Northeast Bureau Working Group of the CPC Central Committee made a proposal and Soviet experts made suggestions in October of last year, after which the plant began to experiment with organizing specialized sections in the processing workshops. The transfer of all machine tools in the processing workshops was not carried out until the Spring Festival of this year. The method of issuing operation plan targets by the production section was not changed until the end of last year.

    This year, the situation of excessive parts reserves and unbalanced production in the processing workshops still exists. At the end of May, more than 400 of the 580 types of parts managed by the semi-finished product warehouse had reached or exceeded the needs of the entire month of June, and the stored parts were still not in complete sets, with the difference between the maximum and minimum being about 300 pieces. Because the production of the processing workshops is not balanced enough, the equilibrium rates of the processing workshops in March and April were only around 30%. There are many reasons for the unbalanced production in the processing workshops: the organization of the transition between new and old products is not well done and cannot be carried out according to plan; the scrap rate of sand casting is very high and fluctuates greatly, often disrupting the operation plans of the processing workshops; the supply of tools and fixtures is not timely and the quality cannot be guaranteed, and the production of the tool workshop is in a state of no plan, which is a major factor affecting the production of the processing workshops. In addition, some grassroots cadres and workers in the workshops are not at ease with their work, which also affects production. However, the leaders of the plant have not realized that the high assembly equilibrium rate and the low equilibrium rate of the processing workshops are abnormal phenomena that rely on excessive reserves to maintain the equilibrium of the assembly workshop's production. Therefore, they have not taken effective measures to solve the various weak links that affect the operation plan of the processing workshops in order to improve the equilibrium rate of parts production, so that the equilibrium of assembly workshop production is established on the comprehensive equilibrium of the entire plant's production, thereby appropriately reducing the amount of parts reserves to speed up the turnover of funds. On the contrary, they believe that this year's reserves are too small, fearing that this will affect the equilibrium of assembly workshop production. Therefore, they once advocated lowering the plans for April and May in order to replenish reserves. Recently, Huang Jing, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, pointed out in a letter to the plant director: "A certain degree of satisfaction with the equilibrium of the assembly workshop is an ideological obstacle to your (referring to the plant) organization of comprehensive equilibrium production"; "Relying on increasing the amount of reserves to maintain the equilibrium of assembly not only accumulates more working capital, but more importantly, it easily makes people feel inertia and relax the struggle against weak links." The plant should correct some wrong views on balanced production according to this instruction, quickly overcome the above-mentioned weak links, and promote day and night operation plans according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, and strive to achieve comprehensive equilibrium.

    Secondly, the plant often shows conservatism when preparing plans.

    Last year, when discussing the increase production and practice economy plan, the targets determined by the leadership were lower than the figures discussed by the workers. The administrative side emphasized that the large planer in the processing workshop was a weak link, saying that the plan should not be based solely on the outstanding links. However, it did not vigorously mobilize the masses to break through this weak link. The administrative side said that the targets proposed by the workers were not realistic because they did not consider the various unexpected unfavorable factors, but it did not mobilize the masses to use everyone's wisdom to prevent or reduce the impact of various unfavorable factors. The plant does not pay enough attention to relying on the masses, which is also reflected in the issue of promoting advanced experiences. After organizing rhythmic production, the plant's administrative leadership criticized the past method of promoting advanced experiences in a general way without grasping the key problems, and advocated focusing the leadership on weak links. This was completely correct and has achieved great results. However, when the weak links have gradually become prominent links, the plant has not only relaxed the leadership of promoting advanced experiences and finding shortcuts in this part, but even dared not promote advanced experiences. Last year, after the processing workshop became stronger, many rationalization proposals of the workers could not be technically identified in time. Shen Dezhang of the No. 6 Machine Tool Plant created the experience of transforming belt lathes, but the plant did not learn from it. They were afraid that the processing workshop would become stronger after learning it. This is a conservative tendency. Since organizing balanced production, the plant has continuously broken through weak links and made continuous progress in production. However, if this tendency develops, it may cause the leadership to not overcome weak links and suppress advanced factors when production is unbalanced.

    When preparing plans, the plant often considers the factors of increasing production only after it has absolute certainty. Sometimes, the targets proposed by the production section include some factors that should be strived for or factors that are expected to improve, such as the improvement of workers' labor proficiency, etc., but the leadership often disagrees. The comrades of the plant are always afraid of encountering more difficulties in the implementation of the plan. The plant and the higher-level leading organs had a dispute over the plan for May of this year. The plant believed that if the targets of this plan were followed, it would disrupt the equilibrium of production, cause rushes, and make it impossible to complete the subsequent plans. In fact, by the end of May, the plant not only completed the plan, but also had more progress in the equilibrium situation than in the past few months. The situation of insufficient reserves caused by various reasons in the past has also begun to change. However, some comrades in the plant still believe that although this month is good, there will be difficulties in the future. This fear of difficulties and fear of breaking the equilibrium is a major obstacle to the plant's organization of advanced balanced production.

    In the past, criticisms have been made about the conservatism of the plant's plans. However, the administrative leaders of the plant disagreed. In addition to the above-mentioned reasons, the plant's failure to humbly accept criticism and recognize shortcomings is also a major obstacle to organizing advanced balanced production. Some comrades in the plant have such a mood that they always feel that some plants often fail to complete their tasks; the plant overfulfills its tasks every month, but is criticized for being conservative, and they cannot understand it. It should be admitted that compared with other machine tool plants, the plant's production has indeed grown rapidly in the past year, and the face of management has also undergone fundamental changes. However, the problem is that the plant should demand itself with higher and more advanced standards, and should not compare itself with those units whose planning and management are not yet sound. Being satisfied with overfulfilling the task, being satisfied with an equilibrium rate of more than 90%, and fearing that the amount of reserves will be broken, it is impossible to formulate advanced plans, so that the plans cannot fully play a role in promoting production; nor is it possible to keenly discover the imbalances that are constantly occurring in production, so that balanced production cannot always maintain an advanced level. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "There are many things that may become our burdens and burdens as long as we fall into blindness to them and lack awareness." The comrades of the plant should well review these teachings, summarize and check their work soberly and seriously, affirm their achievements, and recognize their shortcomings, so as to continue to move forward.

    必须组织先进的全面的均衡生产
    ——沈阳机械三厂组织均衡生产中的问题
    宋琤
    沈阳机械三厂从一九五一年第三季度开始学习苏联先进经验，按指示图表组织有节奏生产，一年多来，已经获得了显著的成绩。一九五二年三厂的产量已比一九五一年提高了二倍多，产品质量、劳动生产率显著提高，成本降低。到一九五二年第四季末，已基本上能够按日完成车床的生产，装配车间的均衡率达到百分之九十左右。但这并不是说三厂的计划管理已经尽美尽善了。三厂的计划常常有一定程度的保守；商品生产的均衡率虽然很高，但零件生产的均衡率还不够高，加工车间按日完成计划的情况还不够好，生产和管理工作中发生的问题有些还解决得不够快。这些，都使三厂的潜在能力不能得到更充分的发挥。这些缺点不能及时得到克服，是与三厂从上（包括党组织和工会）到下开始自觉或不自觉地滋长了一定程度的自满和保守情绪有关的。
    三厂的自满情绪首先表现在对均衡生产中发生的问题感觉不锐敏，在一定程度上满足于装配车间的较高的均衡率，而不注意生产的全面的均衡。去年三厂曾经发生储备量和工序占用量过大而不平衡的现象。到去年十月末，加工车间的零件、材料、半成品等在二、三车间积压的约有二百台份左右（到去年年底，该厂车床生产每月才达到一百台左右）。而且，库存的零件和车间的半成品又很不平衡。二车间要加工二百零五种零件。当时就有五十种没达到指标，其中差二百台份的两种，差一百台份以上的十一种，超过指标的有一百三十九种，其中超过一百台份以上的有七种，最多和最少相差到四百零四台份。三车间也是这样，最多和最少相差五百七十多台份。加工车间内部周转的半成品也有过多和不平衡的现象。当时二、三两个加工车间积在工序中的零件少的有五十台份，多的达二百台份以上。职工们把这种情况叫做“大肚子”。就是说，在这个期间，虽然装配车间的均衡率很高，但是，均衡是不够先进也不够全面的。零件和在制品的积压和不平衡造成生产能力的浪费和资金的积压。只就材料成本计算，当时已积压资金十三亿元多，这是生产管理计划性不够的表现。
    产生这种情况的原因很多，除了当时质量补课大批车床退修，相对地削弱了装配车间的力量，同时质量要求提高，更加重了工具供应的困难以外，主要的原因有以下几种：一、加工车间的力量逐步生长起来，超过了装配车间，但是领导上却没有及时地采取有效的措施，来突破装配车间这个薄弱环节。直到零件积压问题已经相当严重以后，装配车间才采用专业化分工的办法去提高劳动生产率。二、生产科每月确定作业计划指标时，只是笼统地整台份地下指标，结果上月超额完成任务的零件越积越多，上月完不成任务的零件，更加完不成任务。同时生产科下指标时总是多投料，少要任务。这一方面是因为对废品率还控制不住，另一方面也由于错误地认为这样做可以使加工车间不受装配车间的“威胁”，以免打破均衡。去年十月时，投料的累积数字和要任务的累积数字相差竟达七十台份。三、加工车间内部的生产组织不能适应计划管理的需要，也给车间编制作业计划和执行作业计划带来很大困难。在开始组织有节奏生产时，三厂曾经在加工车间进行了固定机床、固定工人、固定工作物的工作，以后，又根据工作物的类型来划分小组，把同一类型的工作物组织在一个小组内生产。经过这些改进，工人的操作专门化了，节省了工具样板，技术容易熟练，劳动生产率提高约百分之三十左右。但是，这时加工车间的工段仍是按机床性质组织的。每种零件，差不多都需要经过车工、刨工、铣工……等几个工段才能加工完毕。零件旅行的道路很长，辅助生产时间占得太多。同时，一个工段只管一个工序，工序之间无法衔接，那一个工段长对于零件的整个生产过程都不负责任。这样的生产组织，使车间编制作业计划时，须由计划员一个人从头到尾把数百个零件、数百道工序组织到每个机床每个工人身上，因而编制计划的时间拖得很长，同时，这样庞大繁杂的工作集中在一个人身上，就很难保证不出差错。在执行计划过程中，调度员也很难掌握零件在工序间的流动情况，削弱了调度工作保证作业计划实现的作用。三厂对于其他厂的先进经验有时学习得不够虚心。加工车间的专业化工段和装配车间的劳动分工专业化是别的工厂早已创造出来的先进经验。三厂在相当长的时间内却没有组织学习，个别领导干部甚至怀疑这些先进经验的效果。三厂对当时生产中的这些问题也感觉得不够锐敏，这种情况，直到去年十月，经中共中央东北局工作组提出、苏联专家建议后，三厂才开始试验在加工车间组织专业化工段。加工车间全部机床的调动，直到今年春节时才进行。生产科下作业计划指标的办法也直到去年年底才开始改变。
    今年，零件储备过多，加工车间生产不均衡的情况仍然存在，五月底，半成品库所掌管的五百八十多种零件，已有四百多种达到或超过了六月份全月的需要，储存的零件仍然不是整台份的，多少相差在三百件左右。因为，加工车间的生产是不够均衡的，三、四月份，加工车间的均衡率都只在百分之三十上下。加工车间生产的不均衡原因很多：新旧产品交替工作组织得不好，不能按计划进行；翻砂废品率很高，并且波动很大，经常打乱加工车间的作业计划；工具、卡具供应不及时，而且质量不能保证，工具车间的生产处于无计划状态，这是影响加工车间生产的重大因素。另外，车间的一些基层干部和工人不安心工作，也使生产受到影响。但是，三厂的领导方面并没有认识到装配均衡率高，加工等车间均衡率低，依靠过多的储备量来保持装配车间生产的均衡是一种不正常的现象。因而他们也没有采取有效措施来解决影响加工车间作业计划的各种薄弱环节，以提高零件生产的均衡率，使装配车间生产的均衡建立在全厂生产的全面的均衡上，从而适当减少零件储备量，以加快资金的周转。相反地，他们反而认为今年的储备量太少了，害怕因此而影响装配车间生产的均衡，因此，曾经主张把四、五月份的计划压低，以便补充储备量。最近，第一机械部黄敬部长在给三厂厂长的信中已经指出：“某种程度的满足于装配车间的均衡，是你们（指三厂）组织全面均衡生产的一个思想障碍”；“依靠加大储备量来保持装配的均衡，不仅会积压较多的流动资金，更重要的是它很容易使人们产生惰性，放松对薄弱环节的斗争。”三厂应该根据这个指示，纠正对均衡生产的一些错误看法，迅速克服上述薄弱环节，并根据苏联专家的建议，推行昼夜作业计划，争取实现全面的均衡。
    其次，在编制计划时，三厂也常常表现出保守情绪。
    去年，讨论增产节约计划时，领导方面确定的指标低于工人讨论的数字。行政方面强调加工车间的大刨床是薄弱环节，说订计划不能只根据突出的环节。但是却没有大力发动群众去突破这个薄弱环节。行政方面说工人提出的指标不切合实际，因为没有考虑各种意外的不利的因素，但是，却没有发动群众运用大家的智慧来防止或减少各种不利因素的影响。三厂不够重视依靠群众，还表现在对待推广先进经验的问题上。在组织有节奏生产以后，三厂的行政领导方面批判了过去那种泛泛地抓不住关键问题的推广先进经验的方法，主张把领导重点放在薄弱环节方面，这是完全正确的，也收到了很大的效果。但是，当薄弱环节已经逐渐成为突出的环节时，三厂不但放松了对这一部分推广先进经验、找窍门工作的领导，甚至不敢去推广先进经验。去年，加工车间力量大了以后，工人的许多合理化建议都不能及时地得到技术上的鉴定。机械六厂沈德彰创造了改造皮带车床的经验，三厂也没有学习，他们怕学习了以后加工车间的力量更大了。这是一种保守的倾向。三厂在组织均衡生产以来，曾经不断地突破薄弱环节，使生产不断前进。但是，如果这种倾向发展下去，就有可能使领导方面在生产不均衡时，不去克服薄弱环节，而去抑制先进因素。
    在编制计划时，对于提高生产的因素，三厂常常是要有了绝对把握以后才肯考虑在内。有时，生产科提的指标内包括一些应该争取的因素或者预计可以提高的因素，比如工人劳动熟练程度的提高等，领导方面常常是不同意的。三厂的同志们总怕执行计划中会遇到较多的困难。今年五月份的计划，三厂和上级领导机关曾经发生争论。三厂认为，如果按照这个计划的指标，将会破坏了生产的均衡，引起突击，使以后的计划完不成。实际上到了五月底，三厂不但完成了计划，而且均衡的情况比过去几个月有了进步。过去，因为种种原因而造成的储备量不足的情况也开始改变了。但是，三厂有些同志仍然认为这月虽然好了，以后还会有困难。这种害怕困难，害怕均衡被打破的情绪，是三厂组织先进均衡生产的一大障碍。
    过去，各方面对三厂计划的保守曾经提出过批评。但是，三厂的行政领导干部是不同意的。除了上述几种原因外，三厂不能虚心接受批评、认识缺点也是组织先进的均衡生产的一大障碍。三厂有些同志有这样一种情绪，他们总觉得有的厂经常完不成任务；三厂月月超额完成任务，反而被批评为保守，心里想不通。应该承认，三厂和其他的机械厂相比，这一年多来生产的增长确是迅速的，管理工作的面貌也有了根本的改变。但是，问题在于，三厂应该拿更高更先进的水平来要求自己，而不应该和那些计划管理还不健全的单位相比。满足于超额完成任务，满足于百分之九十以上的均衡率，害怕储备量被打破，就不可能制订先进的计划，使计划不能充分发挥对生产的推动作用；也不可能锐敏地发现生产中不断发生的失调现象，使均衡生产不能经常保持先进的水平。毛泽东同志教导我们：“有许多的东西，只要我们对他们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。”三厂的同志们应该很好地重温这些教诲，清醒地、认真地来总结和检查自己的工作，肯定成绩、认识缺点，以便继续前进。
