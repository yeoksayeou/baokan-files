    Currently, Shandong has entered the rainy season, and some of the stored coarse grains and newly harvested wheat have high moisture content. Coupled with the hot weather, spoilage has occurred. The Shandong Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau recently issued an urgent notice to grain departments in various regions to strengthen the storage of coarse grains and new wheat. In Ziyang County, Tengxian Special District, 120,000 jin out of 590,000 jin of sorghum and corn transferred from Inner Mongolia have already become moldy and deteriorated. In Huimin Special District, 21,000 jin of moldy wheat were discovered in fifteen warehouses in six days. Grain infestation is also occurring in many areas; for example, the worm infestation rate of 300,000 jin of corn in Putai County has reached 17 percent. The Shandong Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau recently issued a notice, pointing out that grain departments at all levels must be vigilant, strengthen the education of storage personnel, establish a long-term grain storage concept, and overcome the mentality of complacency and waiting for external transfer. Responsibilities should be assigned at each level, and specialized personnel should be organized to regularly inspect warehouses and stacks. If leaks, dampness, or other problems are found, repairs and handling should be carried out promptly. The newly harvested wheat and coarse grains with high moisture content should be exposed to the sun during good weather to reduce the moisture content to standard levels. The notice instructed grain departments in various regions to effectively carry out pest control work in warehouses. For grains collected and purchased, warehousing, sun exposure, and sealing should be carried out simultaneously, and attention should be paid to timely ventilation. Grains that have already been infested with insects should be sprayed with (pesticide) powder and sieved in a timely manner, to achieve "early treatment and thorough cure." Chen grains that are prone to mold and grain stored in low-lying areas should be transferred and sold as soon as possible. In order to do a good job in flood and wind prevention, grain departments in various regions should strengthen contact with flood prevention, water conservancy, and meteorological departments.

    山东省粮食厅通报所属粮食部门加强粗粮和新小麦保管工作
    目前山东已到阴雨季节，部分库存粗粮和收购的新麦水分较大，加上天气炎热，已发生霉烂现象。山东省人民政府粮食厅在最近发出紧急通报，要各地粮食部门加强库存粗粮和新小麦的保管工作。滕县专区滋阳县由内蒙调进之高粱、玉米五十九万斤中有十二万斤已霉烂变质；惠民专区六天中就发现十五处仓库霉烂小麦二万一千斤。粮食被虫蚀现象也在不少地区发生，如蒲台县的三十万斤玉米虫蚀率已达百分之十七。山东省人民政府粮食厅最近发出通报，指出：各级粮食部门要提高警惕，加强对保管人员的教育，树立长期保粮观念，克服麻痹大意等待外调的思想；逐级交代责任，经常组织专人检查仓房、囤垛，发现漏雨、反潮等情况要迅速修补、处理。对收进的新小麦和水分较大的粗粮，要抓紧好天出晒，使其水分降至标准水平。通报指示各地粮食部门要切实做好防治仓虫工作。凡征收与收购的粮食，要作到边入库、边曝晒、边密闭，并注意适时的通风。已经发生虫蚀的粮食，要及时喷（药）粉过筛，作到“治早治了”。对易霉烂的陈粮和低洼处的存粮，要尽先调运和出售。为作好防汛、防风，并要各地粮食部门与防汛、水利、气象等部门加强联系。    （新华社）
