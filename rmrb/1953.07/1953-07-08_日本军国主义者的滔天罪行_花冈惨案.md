The remains of 560 Chinese prisoners of war and forced laborers who were murdered by Japanese militarists at the Hanaoka Mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan, and other locations during the Anti-Japanese War have finally returned to their homeland. This is the result of a long struggle by overseas Chinese in Japan and peace-loving Japanese people, and a concrete manifestation of the friendly unity between the Chinese and Japanese people against the revival of Japanese militarism. The "Hanaoka Massacre" is just one of many atrocities committed by Japanese militarists against the Chinese people during the war in Japan. The truth of this incident once again exposes the extremely brutal face of Japanese militarists. During the war, a total of three batches of more than 900 captured Chinese soldiers and civilians who were forced to work as laborers at the Hanaoka Mine in Japan. The first batch of approximately 300 people, sent from China at the end of July 1944, were all captured soldiers, anti-Japanese farmers, and conscripted laborers, the vast majority of whom were young men.

After the Japanese militarists sent the first batch of approximately 300 people to the Hanaoka Mine in Akita Prefecture, they forced them to do back-breaking labor. They worked from before dawn until dark every day, and they were beaten by the overseers whenever they stopped working or straightened their backs. People were beaten to death or crippled almost every day. They ate only one steamed bun and a raw, hard black radish per meal. Driven by hunger, they had to climb mountains to find wild grass to eat. Although two of their companions were poisoned to death by wild grass, they had to continue searching for wild grass to satisfy their unbearable hunger.

Later, when they could no longer endure it, they sent representatives to request more food rations. However, the Japanese "dormitory chiefs" and supervisors responded with more insults and beatings. Not only that, but the inhumane Japanese militarists further reduced their rations and intensified their labor. Under the name of "Construction Week," their labor became even more arduous, and they not only had to work at night but also be beaten and punished. Under such cruel torture, by the end of 1944, there were fewer than 100 people left, excluding those who had died, were injured, or had fallen ill.

In mid-April 1945, the second batch of more than 500 Chinese prisoners of war was sent from Qingdao to Hanaoka. About ten days later, a third batch of more than 80 people arrived.

As the number of prisoners increased, the cruelty of the supervisors also intensified. In June, a prisoner, unable to bear the hunger, secretly went up the mountain at night to find wild grass to eat. The supervisor discovered this, caught him, and brought him back. The supervisor then gathered all the prisoners and publicly announced the "crime" of this prisoner, then handed a wooden stick to the other prisoners and ordered them to beat him. The other prisoners firmly refused this order. The supervisors were furious, beating the prisoner black and blue with fists and kicks. This was not enough; they inhumanely placed a red-hot iron rail between the prisoner's legs, immediately scorching the flesh. At this time, some supervisors actually smoked cigarettes and watched the torture with amusement, even using cigarette butts to burn the victim's neck.

This inhuman torture burned the victim's flesh and bones and ignited the anger of all the captured soldiers and civilians. They could no longer endure it. On the night of June 30, 1945, they raised shovels and spades and, after killing three Japanese supervisors, one Japanese translator, and one traitor, fled to the nearby mountains.

The Japanese militarists mobilized military police from all over Akita Prefecture to surround and capture the Chinese prisoners of war and civilians who had escaped into the mountains. As a result, all those who had escaped were gradually arrested again.

The arrested Chinese prisoners of war and civilians were subjected to even more brutal torture and murder. They were all forced to kneel in the open square in front of the Hanaoka Theater under the scorching summer sun. Japanese police patrolled among them, grabbing those they suspected and taking them to the torture chamber prepared in advance in the theater. There, they interrogated them with appalling torture such as beatings, pouring cold water, and hanging people in the air by tying their thumbs with iron wires. Many people were tortured to the point of near death and then taken to the police station to be imprisoned. Those kneeling in the open square were not allowed to move even slightly or given any food for four consecutive days. They knelt under the hot sun, and the Japanese police constantly beat them with bamboo swords, bamboo spears, and clubs. Those who could not support themselves and leaned on others or fainted on the ground were beaten to death or injured by the police. In these four days, a total of ninety-seven people were beaten to death on the spot or died after being injured. Many days after this brutal massacre, the Japanese militarists finally had people dig two large pits in the mountains to bury the dead.

According to investigations by overseas Chinese groups in Japan and others after the war, as many as 561 victims of such abuse and murder among the Chinese civilians who were sent to the Hanaoka Mine during the war have had their remains discovered.

The Japanese military blocked the news of this tragedy. After Japan's surrender, the Yokohama Military Tribunal of the US occupation headquarters delayed until March 1, 1948, before sentencing a few minor perpetrators. However, Kamada, the chief of the Akita Prefecture Special Higher Police Department, who was in charge of the massacre on the spot, as well as Akita Prefecture Governor Hisayasu and Prefectural Police Chief Takeoka Kenichi, who should have been directly responsible, were not sentenced. Takeoka Kenichi even served as the Akita Prefecture General Affairs Minister after the war. Moreover, the US occupation authorities, the Japanese government, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's delegation to Japan colluded with each other to cover up the truth of this crime by the Japanese militarists. These criminal acts by the US, Japan, and Chiang reactionaries exposed their deliberate attempt to revive Japanese militarism.

Through the joint efforts of the Overseas Chinese Democratic Promotion Association in Japan, Japanese democratic groups, and the Japanese people, the truth of the "Hanaoka Massacre" finally broke through the cover of the US, Japanese, and Chiang reactionaries and came to light. Along with it were also revealed many wartime incidents of Japanese militarists murdering our compatriots, such as the Kisoya Massacre, the Nanao Massacre, and the Kosaka Massacre. Overseas Chinese groups in Japan and Japanese democratic groups have been making continuous efforts to collect the remains of these martyrs and escort them back to China.

The remains of the 560 martyrs who died in the "Hanaoka Massacre" and other incidents have returned to the liberated land of the motherland. The crimes of Japanese militarism must be settled. Although the US and Japanese reactionaries are doing their best to actively revive Japanese militarism, under the resolute struggle of the Japanese people and the friendly unity of the Chinese and Japanese people and other countries, all their conspiracies against peace will be met with shameful failure.

Rest in peace, martyrs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    日本军国主义者的滔天罪行—“花冈惨案”
    鲁荣新
    抗日战争中在日本秋田县花冈矿山以及其他地方被日本军国主义者虐杀的中国被俘士兵和被强征的工人的遗骨五百六十具终于回到了自己祖国的故土。这是旅日华侨和爱好和平的日本人民长期斗争的结果，是中日两国人民友好团结、反对日本军国主义复活的具体表现。 “花冈惨案”仅仅是战时在日本发生的日本军国主义分子虐杀中国人民的许多暴行中的一件。这次事件的真相再一次揭露了日本军国主义者无比残暴的面目。战时被押送到日本花冈矿山作苦工的被俘和被强征的中国军民前后一共三批，有九百多人。一九四四年七月底从中国送往日本的第一批约三百人，都是抗日战争中被俘的战士、抗日的农民和被强征的劳动人民，其中绝大多数是青年男子。
    日本军国主义者把第一批约三百人押到秋田县花冈矿山后，就强迫他们做牛马不如的苦役。他们每天从天不亮劳动到天黑，工作中只要一停手或伸直腰就要遭到监工的毒打，被打死或打残废的人几乎无日不有。他们吃的是每顿一个馒头和一根又生又硬的黑萝卜。为饥饿所逼，他们只得爬山找野草吃。虽然有两个同伴被野草毒死，他们还是不得不继续找野草来解决难忍的饥饿。
    后来，他们实在无法忍受了，便派代表要求增加口粮。但是管理他们的日本“寮长”和监工的回答是给他们更多的辱骂和拳棒。不仅如此，毫无人性的日本军国主义分子反而进一步减少他们的口粮和加重他们的劳动。在“建设周”的名义下，他们的劳动更加加倍地沉重，他们不但连在黑夜都要工作，而且要挨打受罚。在这样残酷的折磨下，到一九四四年底，除去死的、伤的和病倒的以外，剩下已不足一百人。
    一九四五年四月中旬，第二批中国战俘五百多人从青岛押送到花冈。十天左右，又送来第三批八十多人。
    随着俘虏人数的增多，监工的残暴也越来越厉害。在六月里，有一个俘虏因饥饿不堪而乘着黑夜偷跑上山去找野草吃，被监工查出抓了回来。监工接着召集了全体俘虏，当众宣布了这个俘虏的“罪状”，然后把木棒交给其他的俘虏拷打他。其他的俘虏都坚决拒绝了这个命令。监工们暴跳如雷，他们拳脚交加地把这个俘虏打得遍体鳞伤。这还不够，他们又绝灭人性地把一根烧得通红的铁轨挟在这个俘虏的两腿之间，腿上的肉立刻烧得焦黑。这时，一些监工居然抽着香烟在旁边看着取乐，而且用烟头去烧受刑者的脖子。
    这种惨无人道的酷刑烧烂了受刑者的骨肉，也烧起了全体被俘军民的怒火。他们再也无法忍耐下去了。一九四五年六月三十日夜里，他们举起铁锹和铁铲，在打死了三个日本监工、一个日本翻译和一个汉奸之后逃到附近山上去了。
    日本军国主义者动员了秋田县全县的军警去围捕逃入山中的中国被俘军民，结果逃跑的人又全部陆续被逮捕。
    被捕回的中国被俘军民遭到了更加残暴的虐杀。他们全部被迫令在夏天的烈日之下跪在花冈剧院前面的空场上，日本警察在他们中间来回巡视，把认为有嫌疑的人抓到剧院里事先准备好的刑场里去，在那里，用毒打、灌凉水、用铁丝绑住拇指把人吊在空中等等惨不忍睹的酷刑来审问。许多人被拷问得奄奄一息之后又押到警察局去坐牢。跪在空场上的人则连续四天不准稍微移动，也不给一点食物。他们在暑天的烈日下一直跪着，日本警察不断用竹刀、竹枪和棍棒加以毒打。其中因体力不能支持而斜靠着别人或晕倒在地上的人便被警察当头一棒打死或打伤。在这四天中，当场被打死和打伤后死去的一共有九十七人。这场残暴屠杀过后许多天，日本军国主义者才让人在山中挖了两个大坑把死者埋葬。
    根据战后旅日华侨团体等的调查，战时被送到花冈矿山去的中国军民遭到这样虐杀的，仅遗骨已被发现者就有五百六十一人。
    日本军部封锁了这一惨案的消息。日本投降后，美国占领军总部的横滨军事法庭拖延到一九四八年三月一日才判处了少数几个次要人犯。而虐杀案的当场指挥者、秋田县特高课课长鎌田以及应负直接责任的秋田县知事久安和县警察部长武冈宪一等却一个也未判刑，武冈宪一居然在战后还任秋田县总务部长。不仅如此，美国占领当局、日本政府和蒋匪帮驻日代表团还互相勾结，掩盖日本军国主义者这一罪行的真相。美、日、蒋反动派这种罪恶行径暴露了他们蓄意复活日本军国主义的用心。
    在旅日华侨民主促进会、日本民主团体和日本人民的共同努力下，“花冈惨案”的真相终于冲破美、日、蒋反动派的遮盖，大白于天下了。随着被揭发出来的还有木曾谷惨案、七尾惨案、小坂惨案等许多战时日本军国主义者虐杀我国同胞的事件。旅日华侨团体和日本民主团体并为了收集这些烈士的遗骨和护送遗骨回中国而进行了不断的努力。
    在“花冈惨案”等事件中殉难的五百六十位烈士的遗骨回到解放了的祖国土地上来了。日本军国主义的罪行是必须要清算的。美、日反动派虽竭力在积极复活日本军国主义，但是在日本人民的坚决斗争和中日两国人民和其他各国人民的友好团结下，他们一切反对和平的阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。
    安息吧！烈士们。（新华社）
