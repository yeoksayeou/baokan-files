Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan with three million members, held its Fourth National Congress in Tokyo from July 8th to 11th. The congress was attended by 282 official representatives from 37 unions affiliated with Sohyo. The congress defeated the sabotage conspiracy of right-wing splittists and successfully decided on Sohyo's future direction and tasks.

    Right-wing splittists, centered on the so-called "National Liaison Council for Democratic Labor Movement," tried their best to split Sohyo at the meeting, plotting to turn Sohyo into a tool of American and Japanese monopoly capital. They demanded that Sohyo's activities should "involve less politics." Representatives of the left and right wings engaged in fierce struggle at the meeting. With the support of the broad masses of grassroots members, the left-wing representatives defeated the right-wing elements. The congress first passed a resolution to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet on the 9th. On the last day (the 11th), the congress crushed the opposition of the right-wing elements and passed Sohyo's future working principles with an overwhelming majority. This policy supports the peace movement. Resolutions passed by the congress on this day also included: opposing Japan's acceptance of U.S. "Mutual Security Agency" "aid"; holding a "Peace Month"; opposing "enterprise rationalization" which strengthens military production; and promoting the struggle against the establishment of military bases in Uchinada Village and other places. The congress also announced its firm opposition to the anti-strike law.

    The congress elected a new leadership of Sohyo in which the left wing held the majority. Fujita Tohtaro, chairman of the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union, was elected chairman of Sohyo. The vice-chairmen are: Sadamitsu Miyahara (Japan Teachers' Union), Yoshitaka Morotomi (Vice Chairman of the Japan Coal Miners' Union), Utaro Okamoto (Chairman of the Japan Municipal Transportation Workers' Union League), and Minoru Takano continues as Secretary-General of Sohyo.

    日本工会总评议会举行第四次全国大会
    击败了右翼分子破坏阴谋、决定了工作方针、选出领导机构
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：拥有会员三百万人的日本最大工会组织日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”），已于七月八日到十一日在东京举行了第四次全国大会。出席大会的正式代表有“总评”所属三十七个工会的代表二百八十二人。大会击败了右翼分裂分子的破坏阴谋，胜利地决定了“总评”今后的方针任务。
    以所谓“全国民主主义劳工运动联络协议会”为中心的右翼分裂分子，在会中极力要分裂“总评”，阴谋把“总评”变成美、日垄断资本的御用工具。他们要求“总评”的活动要“少牵涉政治”。左派和右派的代表在会上展开了激烈的斗争。在广大基层会员的支持下，左派的代表战胜了右翼分子。大会首先在九日通过了打倒吉田内阁的决议。大会在最后一天（十一日），粉碎了右翼分子的反对，以压倒多数通过了“总评”今后的工作方针。这个方针支持和平运动。这一天大会通过的决议还有：反对日本接受美国“共同安全署”“援助”；举行“和平月”；反对加强军事生产的“企业合理化”；推进反对在内滩村和其他各地设立军事基地的斗争。大会并宣布坚决反对禁止罢工法。
    大会选出了左派占优势的“总评”的新的领导机构。日本私营铁道工会总联合会主席藤田藤太郎担任“总评”主席，副主席是：宫原贞光（日本教职员工会）、诸富义高（译音）（日本煤矿工会副主席）、冈本丑太郎（日本都市交通工会同盟主席），高野实继任“总评”事务局局长。
