    Heavy Rainfall in Most of Northwest China
    Autumn Crop Planting in Qinghai and Ningxia
    Since late June, most areas of Northwest China have experienced rainfall. The most arid areas, including parts of Tongxin County in Ningxia Province and most parts of Weiyuan, Datong, and Huzhu counties in Qinghai Province, have received soaking rains. The majority of autumn fields are being sown. Qinghai Province plans to sow 4.93 million mu of autumn fields this year, and 4.6 million mu have already been sown while the soil moisture is good. Autumn crops planted earlier have already emerged. The above-mentioned areas are now continuing to rush to plant buckwheat and millet. In Gansu Province, after heavy rains in Guyuan, Haiyuan, and other counties, early autumn crops such as millet, sorghum, and naked oats are growing vigorously, and farmers are planting late autumn crops such as buckwheat. Dingxi, Yongdeng, Yuzhong and other counties have transferred 80,000 jin of buckwheat seeds from Guyuan County and are sowing while the soil moisture is good.
    The rainfall in Xi'an was the heaviest, with 96 millimeters falling in just three days from June 30 to July 2. During these three days, Yan'an County in Shaanxi Province received 68 millimeters of rainfall, and Nanzheng County received 57 millimeters. Pingliang area in Gansu Province received 54 millimeters of rain, and Tianshui received 42 millimeters. These areas, where cotton is beginning to bud and autumn seedlings are developing, have benefited the most. Rainfall in Lanzhou was relatively light, but due to the rising water level of the Yellow River, waterwheels on the riverbanks are turning to irrigate fields. The water volume in various canals in the Pingchuan area of Ningxia Province is also constantly increasing due to the rising water level of the Yellow River.

    西北大部地区降雨
    青海宁夏秋田下种
    西北从六月下旬以来大部地区降雨。最旱的宁夏省同心县部分地区和青海省亹源、大通、互助等县大部地区已得透雨。秋田大部下种。青海省今年计划播种秋田四百九十三万亩，先后已趁墒播种四百六十万亩。播种较早的秋田已经出苗。现在上述各地正继续抢种荞麦、糜子。甘肃省固原、海原等县降透雨后，糜、谷、莜麦等早秋作物生长健旺，农民们正在播种荞麦等晚秋作物；定西、永登、榆中等县已从固原县调运荞麦种籽八万斤，正趁墒播种。
    这次降雨以西安雨量最大，仅六月三十日到七月二日三天内就降雨九十六公厘。这三天内，陕西省延安县雨量达六十八公厘，南郑县达五十七公厘。甘肃省平凉地区下雨五十四公厘，天水四十二公厘。这些地区棉花开始结蕾，秋苗正在发育，获益最大。兰州雨量较小，但由于黄河水位上升，河岸的筒车已经转动灌田。宁夏省平川地区各渠的水量也因黄河水位上升而不断增加。（新华社）
