Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: Since June 25th, northern Kyushu, Japan, has experienced continuous heavy rainfall for five days, causing severe flooding and extensive damage. According to statistics from the National Rural Police Headquarters of Japan as of noon on the 4th, the losses caused by the floods are as follows: more than 2,840 people dead, injured, and missing; more than 14,900 houses destroyed; and more than 1.26 million people displaced. According to the Japanese Ministry of Construction, the losses caused by the floods exceed 100 billion yen, nearly 200,000 hectares of cultivated land have been flooded, and 128 mines have been affected by the floods.

The floods in Kyushu have aroused close concern among the people of Japan. The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the Japan Teachers' Union and other labor unions have begun to work on relief for the victims. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo") held a board meeting on June 30 to discuss the issue of relief for the Kyushu floods. "Sohyo" called on its three million members to donate ten yen each for disaster relief, and demanded that the Yoshida government reduce military spending and allocate military funds to the disaster area for reconstruction and exempt the disaster area people from taxes for three years, etc.

The All Construction Ministry Union and the National Federation of Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Unions issued a statement pointing out that this kind of flood is due to the Yoshida government greatly reducing riverbank construction fees and public works fees, and allocating the budget to military expenses.

    日本九州北部发生严重水灾
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：自六月二十五日起，九州北部接连下降暴雨五天，洪水成灾，灾情十分严重。据日本国家地方警察本部截至四日中午的统计，水灾造成的损失如下：死伤和失踪者共二千八百四十多人；毁坏房屋一万四千九百多幢；流离失所者一百二十六万多人。据日本建设省统计，洪水所造成的损失超过一千亿日元，被洪水淹没的耕地将近二十万公顷，受到水灾的矿场一百二十八个。
    九州的水灾已引起日本全国人民的密切关怀。全日本产业别工会会议、日本教职员工会等工会已开始在进行救济灾民的工作。日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）曾在六月三十日举行干事会会议，讨论救济九州水灾的问题。“总评”号召它的三百万会员每人捐款十日元救灾，并要求吉田政府减少军费，把军费款项拨充灾区的复兴事业费和对灾区人民免税三年等等。
    全建设省工会和全国自治团体工会协议会发表声明指出：这种水灾是由于吉田政府大大削减了河堤修筑费和公共事业费，把预算拨充军事费的缘故。
