Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: Reports from TASS indicate that the decisions of the Plenary Session the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR concerning the anti-Party and anti-state conspiracy of Beria have provoked extensive reactions in Western European countries. Progressive public opinion in various countries has issued comments, unanimously considering this a major victory for the Soviet people and progressive humanity worldwide.

French newspapers and radio stations have published the decision of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the July 10th editorial of the Soviet newspaper "Pravda," and related news. The French Communist Party's official newspaper, "l'Humanité," published a commentary by Courtaud. In discussing the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peaceful diplomacy, he pointed out: The Soviet Union's peace policy is the policy of the entire party formulated by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is also the policy of the Soviet people. The exposure of Beria's crimes is a victory for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and a victory for the cause of peace. At the same time, it is a failure for those who spare no effort and futilely attempt to split the camp of peace-loving countries.

The Italian Communist Party's official newspaper, "l'Unità," published news and commentary about Beria's crimes. "Paese Sera" commenting on the exposure of Beria's evil actions said: The socialist system has defended itself. The Soviet Union has strengthened itself by preventing that chauvinist and foreign agent who attempted economic sabotage from doing harm.

British newspapers and radio stations have published news and commentaries about the Beria affair. The British Communist Party's official newspaper, the "Daily Worker," published an editorial stating: The fact that Beria has been purged proves that the Soviet Union does not allow any policy, does not allow anyone to use any means to harm the cause of peace and democracy, and to hinder the implementation of the plan of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to improve the people's living standards.

In Austria, Vienna's newspapers have published news about the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union purging Beria's anti-Party and anti-state conspiracy. The Central Organ of the Austrian Communist Party, "Volksstimme," published the relevant news, announcements, and the Soviet "Pravda" editorial on its front page. The newspaper pointed out that the indestructible unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people is a devastating blow to all imperialists.

The Danish Communist Party's official newspaper, "Land og Folk," published an editorial pointing out that the exposure of Beria's anti-Party and anti-state conspiracy will further strengthen the Soviet Union. The Soviet people are time-tested, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they have completed the cause of building a socialist society of world historical significance. Now they are equally capable of uniting their ranks around the party of Lenin and Stalin, which led the great Soviet people away from oppression and enslavement toward freedom, happiness, and socialism.

In addition, progressive newspapers in Finland, Sweden, and other countries have also published announcements, news, and commentaries about Beria's crimes.

    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚反党、反国家阴谋的决定，在西欧各国引起了广泛反应。各国进步舆论界纷纷发表评论，一致认为这是苏联人民和全世界进步人类的重大胜利。
    法国的报纸和电台纷纷发表苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决定、苏联“真理报”十日社论及有关消息。法国共产党机关报“人道报”发表了库尔达德的评论。他在谈到苏联一贯的和平外交政策时指出：苏联的和平政策是苏联共产党第十九次代表大会制订的全党的政策，也就是苏联人民的政策。贝利亚罪行的被揭发，是苏联共产党和苏联人民的胜利，和平事业的胜利。但同时，它却是那些不惜采取任何手段、徒劳无益地企图分裂爱好和平国家的阵营的人的失败。
    意大利共产党机关报“团结报”刊载了有关贝利亚罪行的新闻和评论。“国家报”在评论贝利亚的罪恶行动被揭发一事说：社会主义制度保卫住了。苏联已使那个企图进行经济破坏的沙文主义者和外国的代理人不能为害，从而加强了自己。
    英国的报纸和电台都发表了有关贝利亚事件的消息和评论。英国共产党机关报“工人日报”发表社论说：贝利亚被清算的事实证明，苏联不容许任何政策、不容许任何人使用任何手段来损害和平民主事业，来阻碍苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于提高人民生活水平的计划的实现。
    在奥地利，维也纳各报都刊载了关于苏联共产党中央委员会清算贝利亚反党、反国家阴谋的消息。奥地利共产党中央机关报“奥地利人民之声报”，以头版地位刊载了有关的消息、公告和苏联“真理报”社论。该报指出，苏联共产党、苏维埃政府、苏联人民的不可摧毁的团结，对一切帝国主义分子是一个毁灭性的打击。
    丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民报”发表社论指出，贝利亚反党、反国家阴谋的被揭发，将使苏联进一步加强。苏联人民是久经考验的，他们在苏联共产党领导下完成了具有世界历史意义的建设社会主义社会的事业。现在他们同样能够把自己的队伍，团结在领导伟大的苏联人民脱离被压迫和奴役的地位而走向自由、幸福和社会主义的列宁斯大林的党的周围。
    此外，芬兰、瑞典等国的进步报纸也发表了关于贝利亚罪行的公告、新闻和评论。
