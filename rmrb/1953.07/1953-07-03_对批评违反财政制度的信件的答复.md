Column: Responses to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    The "Letters from Readers" page published several letters in April exposing violations of financial regulations. Here is a summary of the replies from the relevant units:

    The Central Broadcasting Administration sent a letter accepting the criticism from readers Lin Faxian and the Financial Inspection Department of the Ministry of Finance (the original letters of criticism were published in this newspaper on April 21st). The bureau has combined the anti-bureaucracy struggle to investigate the backlog of equipment and violations of financial regulations, decided to thoroughly carry out asset clearing work and establish an equipment management system, and reviewed the violations of financial discipline.

    The Emei County People's Government of Sichuan Province sent a letter reporting on the investigation of the Emei County Culture and Education Section's violation of financial regulations. At the end of last year, Cheng Zhong, head of the county's Culture and Education Section, with the connivance and support of Liu Wanwen, the former head of the Finance Section, used surplus funds that should have been turned over to purchase bicycles, radios, dancing clothes, sportswear, and other large quantities of currently useless items in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places. Some of these items are still stored in department stores and have not been collected, some have been damaged, some are being used privately, and most have been sent to various elementary schools, but they are all stockpiled because they are not needed. Teachers in elementary schools throughout the county have expressed their opinions. More seriously, before the incident was exposed, Cheng Zhong and others refused to accept opinions raised by some cadres. After the incident was exposed, they resisted criticism and did not humbly examine their mistakes, and scolded the correspondents who reported the situation to the newspaper. The county government is now dealing with this issue.

    In addition, after this newspaper published a letter from a reader on April 16 criticizing the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance for protecting violations of financial discipline, the department sent a letter on May 11 stating: "This criticism is correct, and we are conducting an investigation. Because the issue involves a wide range of aspects, it will take some time to send you the complete materials." We hope that they will complete the investigation and handling of this issue as soon as possible and inform us of the results.

### 对批评违反财政制度的信件的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对批评违反财政制度的信件的答复
    “读者来信专页”在四月份曾发表了几封揭发违反财政制度行为的读者来信，现将各有关单位的答复简述如下：
    中央广播事业局来信，接受读者蔺法先和中央财政部财政检察司的批评（原批评信刊四月二十一日本报）。该局已结合反官僚主义斗争检查了积压器材和违反财政制度的行为，决定彻底进行清理资产工作和建立器材管理制度，并对违反财政纪律行为作了检讨。
    四川省峨眉县人民政府来信，报告对该县文教科违反财政制度事件的检查情况。去年年底，该县文教科科长程众在前财政科科长刘万文同志的包庇和支持下，把应该上缴的结余款项拿到重庆、成都等地买了自行车、收音机和跳舞衣、运动衣等大批目前用不着的东西。现在这批东西有些还存在百货公司没取，有些已经损坏，有些被私人用着，大部分虽发往各小学，但因用不着都积压起来。全县各小学教师们纷纷提出意见。更严重的是，程众等在事件被揭发前，对某些干部提出的意见拒不接受，在事件被揭发后，又抗拒批评不虚心检查错误，谩骂向报纸反映情况的通讯员。现在县人民政府正在处理这个问题。
    此外，四月十六日本报发表了读者批评福建省财政厅包庇违反财政纪律行为的来信后，该厅在五月十一日来信说：“这个批评是正确的，我们正进行检查。因为问题牵涉面较广，需迟延一些时间才能把全面材料寄给你们。”希望他们尽速把这个问题检查处理完毕，将结果告诉我们。
