Serious Waste in Material Supply and Storage at Kailuan Coal Mine

    The material supply departments and other units of Kailuan Coal Mine are irresponsible, have chaotic systems, blindly purchase, and improperly store materials, resulting in the accumulation and damage of a large number of materials. The scattered and unmanaged off-book materials (i.e., materials without records) alone amount to four to five thousand types, with an initial estimated value of 85 billion yuan.

    The work of the material supply department of Kailuan Coal Mine has a great deal of blindness. They often purchase blindly without asking about the actual needs of production or knowing the actual number in stock. Last year, Kailuan Coal Mine carried out a comprehensive production reform, and the proportion of mechanized coal mining in the entire production increased rapidly. The small-diameter pit props originally used were no longer suitable for the needs of mechanized coal mining underground operations, but the material supply department did not ask about the actual situation and still purchased small-diameter pit props. By the end of March this year, 12,000 cubic meters, about 700,000 props, worth 7.8 billion yuan, had been accumulated; some of them had already rotted. For example, the material supply department did not know that there were still five tons of spring steel in stock, and last year they confusedly purchased another twenty tons. Kailuan Coal Mine only needs about one-third of a ton of spring steel per year, and this batch of spring steel is enough for sixty years. In addition, as a result of not knowing the inventory, they purchased enough carbon brushes for twenty years at once.

    The chaos in the material supply of Kailuan Coal Mine is also due to the fact that the capital construction office and other units could not confirm their plans for a long time. The capital construction plan changed six times this year. When the originally requested materials were shipped, the plan had already changed, and they could not be used. Last year, the civil engineering office successively requested a large number of 8 cm small-diameter purlins, a large amount of steel, and nails. After the purlins worth 1.2 billion yuan, 85 tons of steel worth 900 million yuan, and 283 barrels of foreign nails worth 200 million yuan were successively shipped, some could not be used due to plan changes, or were sent to the warehouse because of so-called "unclear projects, no consideration," resulting in a large backlog of materials.

    The chaos in the request and purchase system of Kailuan Coal Mine and the lack of responsibility are important reasons for the accumulation of materials. In 1951, the chief engineer of Kailuan Coal Mine and other technical personnel held a meeting in the Beijing Guesthouse. Without strictly reviewing and investigating the needs of production, they submitted a foreign order form of more than 100 billion yuan to the Ministry of Fuel Industry. In this staggering foreign order form, there were thirteen tons of aluminum alloy that were seen in British and American magazines but were not needed for current production; some people who were eager for quick success put forward an order form for all the machine tools that attempted to transform the mechanical repair factory into a mechanical manufacturing factory all at once; and there were two mercury distillation devices worth 7 billion yuan that were not needed at all at that time. After paying a 30% deposit, the orders were successively delivered to the mine. Thirteen tons of aluminum alloy worth more than 4 billion yuan, safety lamps worth more than 800 million yuan, and a large number of lathes and boiler steel pipes were all sent to the warehouse because they were not practical. The most absurd thing is that after the orders arrived at the mine, a large number of them did not know which production unit had requested them. There was no request form and no original voucher, and the owner of the goods could not be found.

    While a large number of materials were being accumulated, the entire material storage was also irresponsible, resulting in a large number of materials being damaged. The main warehouse put cables worth 50 billion yuan in a broken shed, letting them be exposed to wind and sun without anyone caring about them. If this continues, they will all be damaged. There are 500 kVA transformers and 500 horsepower electric winch parts dumped in the "scrap iron yard." The seamless steel pipes and five-and-a-half-ton thick steel plates placed in the scrap iron pile are covered with yellow rust after being exposed to wind and rain for a long time, and more than four tons of iron plates have been placed in the open air all year round and have been so corroded that they can no longer be distinguished from the soil.

    The waste situation at Kailuan Coal Mine is very serious, and the mine leaders should quickly find ways to improve it. The relevant leaders should also take necessary measures to deal with this serious situation at Kailuan Coal Mine. (Li Zhuo)

    开滦煤矿器材供应和保管工作中有严重浪费
    开滦煤矿器材供应部门及其它单位，在采购、请购器材工作中无人负责，制度混乱，盲目购进，保管不当，以致积压和损毁了大量器材。仅各处丢散的无人管理的账外物资（即没有账的物资）一项，就有四、五千种，初步估价为八百五十亿元。
    开滦煤矿器材供应部门的工作存在很大的盲目性，往往不问生产实际需要，不知库里实存数目，就盲目采购。去年开滦煤矿进行了全面的生产改革，机械采煤在全部生产中的比重迅速增大，原先使用的小径坑木已不适用机械化采煤井下作业的需要，可是器材供应部门不问实际情况，依然采购小径坑木，到今年三月底，就先后积压了一万二千立方公尺，约有七十万根，价值七十八亿元；其中有一批已经腐朽。又如器材供应部门不知库存尚有五吨弹簧钢，在去年又糊里糊涂购进了二十吨，而开滦煤矿全年只需弹簧钢约三分之一吨，这批弹簧钢足足可用六十年。此外，不知库存的结果，一下子就购进足可用二十年的炭精刷子。
    开滦煤矿器材供应的混乱，也由于该处基本建设处等单位，计划长期不能肯定，基本建设计划今年改变了六次。等到原请购的器材运到后，计划已经更改，就无法应用。去年土木工程处先后提出请购大批八公分小径檩木，大批钢材及钉子，等到价值十二亿元的檩木、价值九亿元的八十五吨钢材、价值二亿的二百八十三桶洋钉陆续运到后，有的因计划变更不能应用，或因所谓“工程不明，不作考虑”，全部送进库房，造成大批器材积压。
    开滦煤矿请购、采购制度的混乱及无人负责是造成器材积压的重要原因之一。一九五一年，开滦煤矿总工程师及其他一些技术人员在北京招待所里开了一个碰头会，他们没有严格地审核和考察生产的需要，就向燃料工业部提出了一张一千亿元以上的国外订货单，在这笔惊人数目的国外订货单里，有从英美杂志上看来，却不是当前生产上需要的十三吨铝合金；有些好大喜功的人提出了企图一下子把机械制修厂改装为机械制造厂的全部机床的订货单；有当时没有任何需要的二台价值七十亿的水银蒸溜器。在付了百分之三十的保证金以后，订货陆续到矿，价值四十多亿元的十三吨铝合金，价值八亿多元的安全灯，大批车床和锅炉钢管，都因为不合实用送进仓库。最荒谬的是订货到了矿里以后，其中有一大批订货竟不知道是那一个生产单位请购的，既无请购书，又无原始凭证，始终找不着货主。
    与大批器材被积压的同时，整个器材保管也是无人负责的，致使大量的器材遭受损毁。总库房把价值五百亿元的电缆放在一个破席棚里，任其风吹日晒没人理会，长此下去，必将全部损毁。被丢在“乱铁院”里有五百伏安的变压器，五百马力电力卷扬机零件。被放在乱铁堆里的无缝钢管和五吨五分厚的钢板经风吹雨打长满了黄锈，四吨多铁板整年放在露天里，被腐朽得已经和泥土分不出来了。
    开滦煤矿浪费的情况是十分严重的，该矿领导方面应速设法加以改进。有关领导方面对开滦煤矿这种严重情况，也应作必要的处置。（李卓）
