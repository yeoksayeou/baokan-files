    In order to ease the quarrels and contradictions between master and slave
    France attempts to win over the three Indochinese puppets with "independence"
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch] The French government issued a statement in Paris on the 3rd, saying that the French government is prepared to "transfer" the powers it still retains to the governments of the member states of the Indochina Federation (i.e., the three puppet governments of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) in order to enable them to "obtain complete independence and sovereignty." To this end, the French government has decided to hold negotiations with the three puppet regimes. However, the statement indicated that France still hopes that the three puppet regimes will "unite within the French Federation" with France. The day before the French government made this decision, French Prime Minister Laniel and Deputy Prime Minister Paul Reynaud held talks with the U.S. Ambassador to France. While the French cabinet was discussing this issue, many U.S. congressmen clamored for the U.S. Congress to amend the "foreign aid" bill, stipulating that the U.S. should not allocate the $400 million in "aid" to France if France does not provide "specific guarantees" of "independence" to the three Indochinese puppet regimes. According to the Associated Press, the French government's adoption of this measure is a way to "appease the United States and the increasingly restless Indochinese countries."
    Although the French government has made a "new" gesture, according to UPI, the capitals of the three member states of the federation "still have reservations" about the French statement. The news said: "Unofficial sources believe that the proposal is not very complete, because the proposal seems to still advocate maintaining ties with France within the French Federation."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch] According to TASS, Paris, 5th dispatch: "L'Humanité" commented on the French government's statement on the 3rd to the three puppet governments of Indochina regarding giving them "complete independence and sovereignty," saying: "The French government is trying to consolidate its rule over the Indochinese puppets. To this end, it proposed 'negotiations' to them. The French government 'promised' them to hold negotiations only to facilitate the puppet's efforts to win them over. The French government hopes to use this method to eliminate mutual quarrels and ease the difficulties between master and slave."

    为了缓和主奴之间的争吵和矛盾
    法国企图用“独立”来笼络印度支那三傀儡
    【新华社七日讯】法国政府三日在巴黎发表声明说：法国政府准备把迄今还保留的职权“移交”给印度支那联邦成员国政府（即越南、寮国、高棉三个傀儡政府），以便使它们“获得完整的独立和主权”。为此目的，法国政府已决定和三个傀儡政权进行谈判。虽然如此，声明表示，法国仍然希望三个傀儡政权和法国“团结在法兰西联邦之内”。在法国政府做出这个决定的前一天，法国总理拉尼埃和副总理保罗·雷诺曾和美国驻法大使举行会谈。而在法国内阁讨论这个问题期间，美国的许多议员就发出叫嚷，要求美国国会修正“援外”法案，规定如果法国不“具体保证”给印度支那三个傀儡政权“独立”，美国就不应拨给法国的四亿美元“援”款。据美联社说：法国政府采取这一措施是想用来“讨好美国和愈来愈不安宁的印度支那国家”的一个方法。
    虽然法国政府已经做出了“新”的姿态，但据合众社说：三个联邦成员国的首都对于法国的声明“还持保留态度”。消息说：“非官方人士认为，这个建议并不十分完备，因为这个建议似乎还主张与法国保持法兰西联邦的联系。”
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎五日讯：“人道报”评论法国政府三日给印度支那三个傀儡政府关于给它们“完整的独立和主权”的声明说：“法国政府力图巩固自己对印度支那傀儡们的统治。为了这个目的，它向他们提议举行‘谈判’。法国政府‘答应’他们进行谈判，只是为了便于傀儡们进行笼络活动。法国政府希望用这种办法消除相互间的争吵和缓和主奴之间发生的困难。”
