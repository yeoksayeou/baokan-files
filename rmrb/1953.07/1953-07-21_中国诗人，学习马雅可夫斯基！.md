Chinese Poets, Learn from Mayakovsky!
	Yuan Shuipai

The great Mayakovsky, "the most outstanding and talented poet of the Soviet era," was the founder of Soviet socialist realism poetry; for the world, this singer of the socialist revolution also influenced the development of revolutionary poetry in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, France, and other countries with his poems of "bombs and banners." Today, the internationally renowned peace warrior and poet, Neruda of Chile, once said that he was stirred by Mayakovsky's voice when he was young; Hikmet of Turkey also proudly called Mayakovsky his teacher. We can say that Mayakovsky's appearance opened a new era for poetry worldwide. China is no exception; Mayakovsky also had a significant influence on the development of new poetry in China.

China's new poetry was born in the May Fourth Movement of 1919. It broke the rigid forms of classical Chinese poetry, pioneered the field of vernacular poetry, and promoted revolutionary democratic ideas. However, due to the oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, the revolution encountered setbacks, which were reflected in poetry, so that at that time, feudalism and bourgeois decadent ideas, and the tendencies of decadent Western European aestheticism and symbolism, still occupied a certain position in Chinese poetry. It was not until the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars that, due to the sharpness of class struggle, the awakening of the people, the growth of revolutionary forces, and the introduction of Soviet literature and poetry, especially the works of Mayakovsky, into China, the budding of Chinese proletarian revolutionary poetry began to grow.

The first to translate Mayakovsky's works into China was the famous poet Guo Moruo, who translated poems such as "Our March," "The Story of How the Fat Man Learned About the Ordinance Protecting Workers," and "Vladimir Mayakovsky's Extraordinary Adventure at the Dacha," in 1929. Afterwards, there were continuous translations and introductions. As for the first person to make Chinese readers know Mayakovsky's name and recognize him as the most important poet after the Russian Revolution who "fully understood the revolution and regarded the revolution as his own cause" among many contemporary poets, it was Qu Qiubai, an outstanding Chinese literary critic and one of the earliest members and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. He visited Mayakovsky in Moscow in 1921 and then reported this to China.

During China's Second Revolutionary Civil War, the revolutionary poetry movement gradually developed. This kind of poetry, which combined with the revolutionary masses and publicized revolutionary ideas, was further developed around the time of the Anti-Japanese War, and poets such as Pu Feng, Ai Qing, Tian Jian, and Ke Zhongping emerged. In their works, we can see the influence they received from Mayakovsky. Ai Qing said in the preface to his "Selected Poems" that he loved Mayakovsky. When he was abroad, he read "A Cloud in Trousers" and other poems from French translations. Tian Jian mentioned in the preface to his collection of poems "To the Fighters" in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War that the Chinese people needed a poet like Mayakovsky. In his own works, there is Mayakovsky-style fighting passion and short, tense rhythm.

In the Anti-Japanese revolutionary base areas, poets such as Tian Jian and Ke Zhongping even wrote "street poems" and "cliff poems" for the revolutionary peasants in the Anti-Japanese revolutionary base areas, just like Mayakovsky wrote poems for "ROSTA Windows." This kind of poetry creation activity closely combined with the revolutionary struggle, with the expansion and deepening of the mass revolutionary struggle, further developed into a mass poetry movement. In the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, soldiers wrote their own poems on their weapons, called "gun poems," which became a sharp weapon of political education in the army. In the campaigns for joining the army, production, and land reform, various forms of poetry—clappers, ditties, ballads…—also played an active role in propaganda and mobilization. At the same time, in the areas under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, in the vigorous "anti-civil war, anti-persecution, anti-hunger" movements launched by workers and students in many cities, many poets created a large number of political satirical poems to expose and satirize the Kuomintang's anti-people atrocities and secret service rule. In strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations, the masses also wrote many political satirical poems, ballad-style slogans, poetry leaflets, recitation poems… They all once played a role in breaking through the enemy's ideological blockade, exposing the reactionaries' conspiracies, and encouraging the people to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule.

Just as Mayakovsky did, our poetry also became
	"bayonets," "rifles," and "cannons," becoming tools to unite ourselves and strike at the enemy. This vigorous development of new poetry serving the revolution swept away the garbage of decadent poetry that imitated Western Europe and was "for art's sake."

The development of Chinese revolutionary literature has been greatly influenced by Soviet literature, and this is also the case in the field of poetry. It can be said that the far-reaching thunder of the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky, after reaching the East, also resonated with the bells and drums of China, making Chinese poetry also have a fighting style. With the process of revolutionary victory, under the personal leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, Chinese poetry, like all Chinese literature and art, has been further developed and has achieved many successes, and is serving national construction and the struggle to resist the United States and aid Korea.

But this does not mean that Chinese poets have learned enough from Mayakovsky. Our learning is very poor. Our efforts in creation are very insufficient. Poetry lags far behind the needs of reality. We lack inspiring works that are widely circulated among the people.

The significant national discussion of Mayakovsky's creation organized by the Soviet Writers' Association at the beginning of this year has aroused strong interest and close attention from Chinese poetry workers. In June, poetry workers in Beijing and researchers and translators of Mayakovsky's works held a symposium. At the meeting, everyone unanimously emphasized the need to learn from the poet and strengthen the translation of his works. We believe that with the holding of the birth anniversary of this world-class great poet, Chinese poets will further strengthen their study of socialist realism poetry and Mayakovsky's traditions.

What should we learn from Mayakovsky?

The production of Mayakovsky's fighting poetry is inseparable from the poet's revolutionary spirit burning like a flame, pure class qualities, and high degree of Party spirit. To create poetry full of fighting power that is needed by the people, we should take Mayakovsky as our example, learn from his close connection with the Party, the working class, and his own people, and contribute all his strength to the Party and to the "attacking class" like him. Mayakovsky both declared this in his works and did so in his actual actions. Only this high degree of integration can give us an unshakable belief in the victory of the cause of the working class and the cause of peace and democracy, and a perspective on the future.

Indifference to life and to the world, even to a slight extent, is a deadly enemy that is incompatible with poetry. Mayakovsky was by no means an indifferent bystander to the revolution, nor was he an observer who "commented" on the revolution from the sidelines, or even a third party who objectively praised it with a sense of obligation. He was a participant in the revolution, an agitator and revolutionary who led the masses to fight. He fought in the course of the revolution, experiencing all the twists, joys, and pains that the revolution experienced, and paid his own blood and sweat for overcoming all the obstacles encountered by the revolution. Only the practice of revolution can generate revolutionary enthusiasm. Only in this way can he feel every breath of the revolution and utter his sincere cry with "the full resounding power of the poet," like a bugle call to inspire the people to move forward. Only in this way can his praise of the revolution, his praise of the Party and Lenin, be filled with ardent love, without the slightest reluctance or pretense. Only in this way can the spiritual beauty of the Soviet people, their noble qualities, and heroism, be embodied through the lyrical protagonist in his works—often the poet himself—and the typical representatives of the new era can be created in general. Only in this way can he mercilessly lash out at the bourgeois enemies and imperialist armed interventionists at home and abroad, and can he warmly sympathize with the world working class, and vividly portray the patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet people in his works.

The Chinese people also need such militant poetry, and definitely do not need poetry that is low or poor in thought, weak in enthusiasm, formulaic in concept, and unable to play a fighting role. To achieve this goal, we must learn from Mayakovsky, improve our political awareness, and, as Stalin said to Demyan Bedny, should complete the "task of rising to become an advanced proletarian singer," must go to the forefront of the struggle of the revolutionary people, instead of falling behind, let alone standing by. We must eliminate any trace of indifferent, bystander, gray emotions—the remnants of non-working-class ideology—from our hearts like expelling poison.

Because it is obvious that only the ideas of the working class, the ideas of communism, and definitely not the ideas of the non-working class, which will only make the pace of historical progress stagnate and regress, can clearly illuminate the path of our progress. If the poet himself lacks the advanced ideas of the working class and retains non-working-class ideas, then how can he inspire and educate the people? Perhaps due to a kind of forced political sense of responsibility, or perhaps writing for impure purposes, then he can only resort to a list of nouns and adjectives, which is filled with words expressing the ideas, feelings, morals, and qualities of the working class, as well as political terms that are correct but have not been transformed into his own flesh and blood, and his job is to match and arrange them to become a poem—what? A slogan-style or formulaic poem. In this poem, the author tries his best to hide his real mental state and adorns the work with beautiful words. Because these words do not truly come from his own life and struggle, and because he himself lacks confidence, the result is bound to lack a sense of reality, and dishonesty, and will never be able to move others.

This kind of creative attitude, this kind of mental state, is not similar to Mayakovsky's creative attitude and ideological position in the slightest, and it also violates Chairman Mao's instructions to literary and art workers in the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to change our original petty-bourgeois standpoint, thoughts, and feelings, to "thoroughly solve the problem of the relationship between the individual and the masses," to "completely integrate" with the "masses of the people," to "become one," to participate in "the fiery struggle," and to be vigilant that all revolutionary workers should not "stand" "behind" the revolutionary masses "pointing fingers and criticizing," but should "stand in front of them and lead them" ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"). To practice according to Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings is always the direction of our work. We must practice in this way in order to hope to obtain a keen sense of response and clear judgment on life and politics like Mayakovsky, and have a high degree of political enthusiasm, so as to quickly reflect the face of the life of the times, spread advanced thoughts and feelings, and guide the people to bravely advance.

In the past, our understanding of Mayakovsky's complete integration with the revolution was insufficient. We did not correctly understand the stage of development of his creation, and in our minds, there was always the impression of a poet with eccentricities, how he got involved with the Futurists in his early years, wearing a yellow shirt... We did not know how, under the influence of the October Revolution, under the education of the Party, and in the revolutionary training, he overcame his early immature thoughts, and how he finally reached the peak of a revolutionary writer who could embody the Party's ideas in his own works.

Mayakovsky's close daily contact with the masses also illustrates his fusion with the revolution. He often worked for newspapers and magazines. In his memorial hall in Moscow, his "Komsomolskaya Pravda" press card is still preserved. His work on "ROSTA Windows" during the civil war is famous. He often traveled at home and abroad to meet with the masses. In the four years from 1926 to 1930, he spent nearly a year on the road. He recited everywhere to workers, peasants, and soldiers. Sometimes he recited or spoke several times a day. He claimed to inherit the tradition of ancient minstrel poets that had been interrupted. In an article, he said: "I don't know if any poet in the past has had this kind of connection with the masses of readers?" He certainly had the full right to say this. On the advertisements for recitations and reports, he often added the program of "talks," answering questions from the audience on the spot and arguing with them.

Mayakovsky stipulated that the poet's duty is "the leader of the people and the servant of the people," which is completely correct. We Chinese poets should take him as an example, learn from his spirit of serving the people. Kalinin once praised him as an "outstanding example of serving the Soviet people." We learn from him, that is, we implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction to serve the people wholeheartedly. We must not blur the revolutionary purpose of poetry at any moment. Work for the Party like Mayakovsky! Do not dislike even the so-called humble work, and use the tool of poetry to serve the people! We know that the poet once wrote poems for the collection of winter clothes needed by the front line, and he also wrote poems for the promotion of products including cigarettes by the national trade authorities. What the Soviet state needed also became what he personally wanted.

Precisely because he had a flesh-and-blood connection with the revolution, he often launched fierce struggles against imperialists, enemies of the revolution, and all phenomena that harmed the interests of the revolution. He said in his poem, "The class enemy is also my enemy." His incomparably sharp political satirical poems, such as "Meeting Mania," are still fresh and powerful even today.

We should take Mayakovsky as an example, learn his talent for satire, and wage a relentless struggle against imperialist warmongers, decadent bourgeois ideas, bureaucracy, and all phenomena that harm the interests of the people.

Mayakovsky wrote: "The main work, the main struggle, that writers must now carry out... is the common struggle to improve quality." Striving to improve the quality of poetry art is also an important task for us today. We strictly demand ourselves, rather than shoddy workmanship, creating every line of poetry "like mining radium," as he said. In the past, we had an incorrect understanding of the form of Mayakovsky's poetry. We once thought that he wrote "prose in lines" and was "completely free," thus fueling our neglect of the regularity of poetry, and even advocating prose style. Now we know that although Mayakovsky had his new creations in poetry art, he was by no means as misunderstood as we did in the past: he "abandoned" all the poetry rules of Russia, on the contrary, he was the inheritor of the national poetry traditions of Pushkin, Lermontov, and Nekrasov. He was able to recite thousands of lines of poems by past poets, and could recite "Eugene Onegin." It was only that he developed this tradition under new historical conditions and created the form most suitable for expressing what he wanted to express. He was very particular about rhythm. He opposed the absence of rhythm. He once drafted sixty times for the rhyme of a few words. He has his innovations and originality in rhythm, which we should also study.

In his article "How to Write Poetry," Mayakovsky mentioned his emphasis on rhyme: "If the rhyme is discordant, the verses will fall apart... The rhyme sends us back to the previous line, forcing us to remember it, keeping all the verses that form an idea together."

On the one hand, we must emphasize the improvement of quality, and on the other hand, we must also emphasize the increase in quantity. Mayakovsky said: "The poet's working day is not eight hours, but sixteen hours, eighteen hours. The poet has a huge work task to the country." The poet wrote more than a dozen volumes of poetry and prose in his short life. In his words, his "pen is constantly working every day and every hour." But this is by no means a hasty and indiscriminate writing. His experience is that he can only write eight to ten lines a day, which is so rigorous!

What we want to learn from Mayakovsky is this. Of course, this learning cannot be understood as formal imitation. It is still useless to deviate from China's reality, not to first familiarize ourselves with and study the life and struggle of the Chinese people, and not to develop our own creativity.

We must cherish and learn from the realistic poetry traditions of our own nation, just as Mayakovsky inherited the Russian classical poetry tradition and the traditions of Gogol and Shchedrin. China has a proud and glorious history of poetry, and we have rich folk ballads living in the mouths of the people. Chinese new poets are not nihilists of national culture, but legal inheritors of the immortal tradition of Qu Yuan and Du Fu, the tradition of revolutionary poetry since the May Fourth Movement, and the tradition of folk ballads.

At the same time, we must also learn from the world's classical realistic poetry and modern revolutionary poetry, and what is more urgent is to learn from the Soviet Union and learn from Mayakovsky. We must improve and strengthen the translation, publication, and research of Mayakovsky's works.

    中国诗人，学习马雅可夫斯基！
    袁水拍
    “苏维埃时代最优秀、最有才能的诗人”伟大的马雅可夫斯基是苏联社会主义现实主义诗歌的奠基人；对世界来说，这位社会主义革命的歌手也以他的“炸弹和旗帜”的诗篇，影响了波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、法国等国家的革命诗歌的发展。今天国际著名的和平战士和诗人，智利的聂鲁达曾说，当他在年青的时候，就被马雅可夫斯基的声音所激动了；土耳其的希克梅特也骄傲地把马雅可夫斯基称为自己的老师。我们可以这样说，马雅可夫斯基的出现使全世界的诗歌开辟了一个新的时代。中国也不例外，马雅可夫斯基也给中国新诗歌的发展以重要的影响。
    中国的新的诗歌是在一九一九年五四运动中诞生的。它打破了文言诗的僵化了的形式，开创了白话诗的园地，宣扬革命民主主义的思想。但由于帝国主义和国内反动势力的压迫，革命遭遇挫折，反映在诗歌上，就使当时中国的诗歌中，封建主义和资产阶级的颓废思想、腐朽的西欧的唯美主义、象征主义的倾向，仍然占着一定的地位。直到第一次和第二次国内革命战争时期，由于阶级斗争的尖锐、人民的觉醒和革命力量的增长，以及苏维埃文学和诗歌特别是马雅可夫斯基的作品的开始介绍到中国来，中国无产阶级革命诗歌的萌芽才获得成长。
    最初翻译马雅可夫斯基作品到中国来的是著名诗人郭沫若，他翻译了“我们的进行曲”、“关于法台如何了解保卫工人的法令的故事”、“符拉其米尔·马雅可夫斯基在别庄中遇到的不平凡的事”等诗，那是在一九二九年。其后不断有人翻译介绍。至于说最先使中国读者知道马雅可夫斯基这名字、认识他是“在许多现在诗人中，只有他是全部理解革命，把革命当作自己的事业”的俄罗斯革命后最重要诗人的人，是中国的杰出文学评论家和中国共产党最早的党员和领导人之一瞿秋白，他曾经在一九二一年在莫斯科访问了马雅可夫斯基，接着就把这件事向中国国内作了报道。
    在中国第二次国内革命战争时期，革命诗歌运动逐渐开展。这种与革命群众结合、宣传革命思想的诗歌，到了抗日战争时期前后，有了更大的发展，出现了蒲风、艾青、田间、柯仲平等诗人。在他们的作品里，我们可以看到他们所受到的马雅可夫斯基的影响。艾青在他的“诗选”的序文中说，他是爱好马雅可夫斯基的。当他在国外的时候，他从法文译本中读到了“穿裤子的云”和其他的诗。田间在他的“给战斗者”这一抗战初期的诗集的序文中说到，中国人民需要有马雅可夫斯基那样的诗人。在他自己的作品中，就有着马雅可夫斯基式的战斗的激情和短促紧张的节奏。
    在抗日革命根据地，田间和柯仲平等诗人甚至像马雅可夫斯基为“罗斯塔之窗”写诗那样，在抗日革命根据地为革命的农民写了“街头诗”“岩壁诗”。这一种和革命斗争相紧密结合起来的诗歌创作活动，随着群众革命斗争的扩大和深入，更进一步地发展为群众性的诗歌运动。在八路军、新四军中，战士们把自己创作的诗歌写在自己的武器上，叫做“枪杆诗”，成为军队中政治教育的犀利武器。在参军运动、生产运动、土地改革运动当中，各种形式的诗歌——快板、小调、歌谣……也同样发挥了积极的宣传鼓动作用。同时，在国民党反动派统治下的地区，在许多城市的工人、学生群众蓬勃展开“反内战、反迫害、反饥饿”运动中，不少诗人创作了大量的政治讽刺诗来暴露和讽刺国民党的反人民的暴行和特务统治。在罢工、罢课和示威游行中，群众也自己写了许多政治讽刺诗、歌谣体的标语、诗传单、朗诵诗……它们都曾经起了冲破敌人的思想封锁，揭露反动派阴谋，鼓励人民向蒋介石法西斯统治进行斗争的作用。
    正像马雅可夫斯基所做的，我们的诗歌也成为
    “刺刀”“长枪”和“大炮”，成为团结自己，打击敌人的工具，这种新的为革命服务的诗歌的蓬勃发展，扫清了模拟西欧的、“为艺术而艺术”的颓废派诗歌的垃圾。
    中国革命文学的发展曾经受到苏联文学的极大影响，在诗歌这领域里也是这样，可以这样说：伟大的苏联诗人马雅可夫斯基的无远弗届的雷声，传到了东方后，也激响了中国的钟和鼓，使中国的诗歌也具有了战斗的风格。随着革命的胜利的进程，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志亲自的领导下，中国诗歌和中国所有文艺一样得到了更进一步的发展，得到了不少成绩，正在为国家建设和抗美援朝斗争服务。
    但这并不是说中国的诗人已经向马雅可夫斯基学习得很够。我们的学习是很差的。我们在创作上的努力是很不够的。诗歌远远地落后于现实的需要。我们缺少激动人心的、在人民中间广泛传诵的作品。
    今年年初苏联作家协会组织的、意义重大的马雅可夫斯基创作的全国性的讨论，已经引起了中国诗歌工作者的浓厚兴趣和密切的注意。六月间北京的诗歌工作者和马雅可夫斯基作品的研究和翻译者举行了一次座谈会。在会上，大家一致强调必须向诗人学习，并加强他的作品的翻译工作。我们相信，随着这位具有世界性的伟大诗人的诞生纪念的举行，中国诗人将进一步加强对社会主义现实主义的诗歌、对马雅可夫斯基传统的学习。
    我们应该向马雅可夫斯基学习什么呢？
    马雅可夫斯基的战斗的诗歌的产生，是和诗人的火焰一样燃烧着的革命精神、纯洁的阶级品质和高度的党性分不开的。我们要创造为人民所需要的充满战斗力量的诗歌，就应该以马雅可夫斯基为我们的榜样，学习他和党、和工人阶级、和自己人民的血肉相联的紧密的结合，像他一样把自己的一切力量贡献给党、贡献给“进攻的阶级”。马雅可夫斯基既在他的作品中这样宣告，也在他的实际行动中这样做。只有这种高度的结合，才能使我们产生对工人阶级的事业、和平民主的事业充满不可动摇的胜利的信念和对未来远景的透视力。
    对生活、对世界的冷淡，即使仅属些微的程度，也是和诗歌不能相容的死敌。马雅可夫斯基对革命决不是一个冷淡的旁观者，也不是一个站在旁边对革命“评头品足”的观察者，甚至也不是一个置身事外、带着义务的心情客观地加以歌颂的第三者。他是革命的参加者，是领导群众走向战斗的鼓动家和革命家。他在革命的进行中作战，体验着革命所经历的一切波折、欢乐和痛苦，并为战胜革命所遭遇的一切阻碍付出自己的血汗。只有革命的实践，才能产生革命的热情。只有这样，他才能感受革命的每一呼吸，以“全部的诗人的响亮的力量”发出自己的真诚的呼喊来，像号角一样鼓舞人民前进。只有这样，他对革命的歌颂、对党和列宁的歌颂，才充满着炽热的爱，而没有丝毫勉强或作伪。只有这样，才能够通过他的作品里的抒情的主人公——时常是诗人本人，体现出苏维埃人的精神的美，他们的高贵品质和英雄气概，概括地创造出新时代人的典型。只有这样，才使他能够无情地鞭挞国内外的资产阶级敌人和帝国主义者武装干涉者，才能热烈同情世界工人阶级，而在他的作品中，把苏联人民的爱国主义和国际主义精神生气勃勃地刻划出来。
    中国人民也需要这样的战斗性的诗歌，而决不是需要思想低下或贫乏的、热情稀薄的、公式概念化的、不能起战斗作用的诗歌。要达到这个目的，就必须学习马雅可夫斯基，提高自己的政治觉悟程度，像斯大林对杰米扬·别德内依所说的，应该完成“上升到先进无产阶级歌手的任务”，必须走到革命人民的斗争的前列去，而不是落在后面，更不是站在旁边。我们要像驱逐毒物一样，清除我们心中任何一丝冷淡的、旁观的、灰色的情绪——非工人阶级的思想残余。
    因为很明显，能够清楚地照亮我们前进的道路的，只有工人阶级的思想、共产主义的思想、而决不是非工人阶级的思想，它们只会使历史前进的脚步停滞、倒退。如果诗人自己缺乏工人阶级先进思想，而残留着非工人阶级思想，那末他怎样去鼓舞和教育人民呢？也许由于一种勉强的政治责任感，也许为了不纯洁的目的而写作，那么他就只能求助于一张名词和形容词的单子，其中列满了表现工人阶级思想、感情、道德、品质的字眼，以及虽然正确却并未化为他自己血肉的政治术语，而自己的工作便是把它们搭配排列起来而成为一首——什么呢？一首标语口号式的，或公式化的诗。在这首诗里，作者千方百计地掩盖了自己的实在的精神状态，而用美丽的字眼把作品披挂起来。由于这些字句并不是真正来自他自己的生活和战斗，由于他自己也缺乏信心，其结果必然缺少真实感，不诚实，也就决不能感动别人了。
    这种创作态度，这种精神状态，是和马雅可夫斯基的创作态度和思想立场，没有丝毫相同之处的，也是违反了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中给文艺工作者的指示的。毛泽东同志教导我们要改变我们原来的小资产阶级的立场思想感情，要“彻底解决个人和群众的关系问题”，要和“人民群众完全结合”，“打成一片”，要参加“到火热的斗争中去”，并警惕所有的革命工作者不要“站在”革命群众的“后头指手画脚地批评”，而要
    “站在他们的前头领导他们”（“湖南农民运动考察报告”）。遵照毛泽东同志的教导去实践，永远是我们工作的方向。我们必须这样实践，才有希望获得像马雅可夫斯基那样的对生活对政治的敏锐的感应力和清楚的判断力，具有高度的政治热情，来迅速反映时代生活的面貌，传布先进的思想感情，引导人民奋勇前进。
    对马雅可夫斯基和革命的完全结合，过去我们的认识是不足的，我们没有正确认识他所经历的创作的发展的阶段，在我们脑子里总存在着一个具有怪癖的诗人的印象，他怎样在早期和未来派们搞在一起，穿着黄上衣……我们不知道他怎样在十月革命的影响下，在党的教育下，在革命锻炼中，怎样克服了早期的不成熟的思想，怎样最后达到了能够在自己作品中体现党的思想的革命文学家的峰顶。
    马雅可夫斯基和群众的亲密的日常的联系也说明了他和革命的熔合一致的关系。他经常为报纸、刊物工作。在莫斯科他的纪念馆中，至今还保存着他的“共青真理报”记者证。在内战时他的“罗斯塔之窗”的工作是有名的。他经常在国内和国外旅行，和群众见面。在一九二六年到一九三○年这四年当中，有将近一年的时间是在路上过的。他到处向工人、农民和兵士朗诵。有时每天朗诵或是演讲几次。他自称要继承已经中断的古代行吟诗人的传统。在一篇文章里他说：“我不知道，过去任何一个诗人有没有过这种同读者群众的联系？”他的确有充分的权利这样讲。在朗诵和报告会的广告上，他还时常加上“谈话”这节目，当场解答听众的问题并和他们争论。
    马雅可夫斯基规定诗人的职责是“人民的领导者和人民的仆人”，这是完全正确的。我们中国诗人要以他为榜样，学习他为人民服务的精神，加里宁曾经赞美他是“为苏维埃人民服务的卓越的典范”。我们学习他，也就是实行毛泽东同志要全心全意为人民服务的指示。我们不能有任何时刻模糊了诗歌的革命目的性。像马雅可夫斯基那样为党工作吧！不嫌厌即使所谓低微的工作，运用诗歌的工具来为人民服务吧！我们知道，诗人曾经为前线需要收集御寒衣服而写诗，也曾经为国家贸易机关的产品推销包括香烟在内而写诗。苏维埃国家所需要的，也变成了他个人所愿望的。
    正因为他和革命有血肉的联系，他对帝国主义者、对革命的敌人和一切损害革命的利益的现象，经常展开着激烈的斗争。他在诗中这样说，“阶级的仇敌也就是我的仇敌”。他的锋利无比的政治讽刺诗像“开会迷”等，即使在今天也还是新鲜而有力的。
    我们要以马雅可夫斯基为榜样，学习他的讽刺的才能，对帝国主义战争贩子，对资产阶级腐朽思想，官僚主义，一切损害人民利益的现象作无情的斗争。
    马雅可夫斯基写道：“作家现在必须进行的主要工作、主要斗争……是提高质量的共同斗争。”努力提高诗歌艺术的质量，也是今天我们的重要任务，我们严格地要求自己，而不是粗制滥造，像他所说的“像开采镭一样”，创作每一行诗。过去我们对马雅可夫斯基的诗歌的形式是有不正确的认识的，我们曾以为他写的是“分行的散文”，是“完全自由的”，因此助长了我们对诗歌的规律性的特点的忽视，甚至提倡散文化。现在我们知道马雅可夫斯基虽则在诗歌艺术上有他的新的创造，但决不如过去我们所误解的那样：他“毁弃”了俄罗斯的一切诗歌规律，正相反，他是普希金、莱蒙托夫、涅克拉索夫的民族诗歌传统的承继者。他能够背诵过去诗人的数千行诗，能背出“欧根尼·奥尼金”。只是他在新的历史条件下发展了这个传统，创造了最适合于表现自己所要表达的内容的形式。他在韵律方面是很讲究的，他反对没有韵律，他曾经有一次为几个字的押韵而打了六十次草稿。他在韵律方面有他的革新和独创，这也是我们所应该研究的。
    马雅可夫斯基在“怎样写诗”一文中，提到他对韵律的重视：“假使不协韵，诗句便要零落散乱……韵律把我们送回到前一行，逼使我们记起它，使形成一个观念的所有的诗行保持在一起。”
    一方面我们要强调质的提高，一方面也要强调量的增加。马雅可夫斯基说：“诗人的劳动日不是八小时，而是十六小时，十八小时。诗人对国家负有巨大的工作任务。”诗人短短的一生共写了十几卷诗文集，用他的话说，他的“笔是不断地每日每时工作的。”但这决不是草率地滥写。他的经验是每天只能写八行到十行，这又是何等的谨严！
    我们所要学习马雅可夫斯基就是这些。这个学习当然决不能理解为形式上的模仿。脱离中国的实际，不首先去熟悉、研究中国人民的生活和斗争，不去发挥自己的创造力，那还是没有用的。
    我们要像马雅可夫斯基承继俄罗斯古典诗歌传统、果戈里和谢德林的传统一样，重视并学习自己民族的现实主义诗歌传统。中国有着值得自豪的辉煌的悠久的诗歌史，我们有丰富的活在人民口头的民间歌谣，中国新诗人不是民族文化的虚无主义者，而是屈原杜甫的不朽传统、五四以来革命诗歌传统和民间歌谣传统的合法承继者。
    我们同时也要向世界古典现实主义诗歌和现代的革命诗歌学习，更迫切需要的是向苏联学习，向马雅可夫斯基学习。我们要改进和加强马雅可夫斯基作品的翻译出版和研究工作。
