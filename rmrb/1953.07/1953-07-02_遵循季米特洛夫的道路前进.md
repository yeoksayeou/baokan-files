    Advance Following Dimitrov's Path
    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Mingqiao Nieichev
    Four years ago, Georgi Dimitrov, the leader and publicly recognized beloved mentor of the Bulgarian working people, the organizer and leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the founder of the Fatherland Front, an outstanding activist in the international workers' movement, a staunch fighter against Fascism and against war, and the standard-bearer of the eternal and unbreakable friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, passed away.
    The death of Georgi Dimitrov meant an irreplaceable loss for the Bulgarian Communist Party, losing a great organizer, leader, and inspirer. Over the course of fifty years, Dimitrov dedicated his life, his profound intelligence as a staunch revolutionary, and his passionate heart to organizing the struggle of the Bulgarian working class, to the work of creating the party of the working class, aiming to make it a brand-new Marxist-Leninist party, adept at uniting the working people under its banner, guiding them to fight against capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression, until the complete victory of socialism and communism. "In the history of the working class struggle, there is no important event in our country's socialist and communist movement in the past fifty years that is not closely linked to the great name of Comrade Georgi Dimitrov and his active organizational and leading activities," the obituary issued by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party et al. wrote upon his death.
    The death of Georgi Dimitrov deprived the Bulgarian people of their most loyal son and leader, who had led them in the arduous struggle against the royal-fascist reactionaries and German imperialism. Comrade Georgi Dimitrov, the initiator and founder of the Fatherland Front, established great merit in the cause of uniting all progressive and democratic forces of the Bulgarian people. Thanks to the glorious victory of the Soviet army over the Hitlerite bandits, the Bulgarian people, inspired and led by the Bulgarian Communist Party, overthrew the royal-fascist regime and, for the first time in history, took their destiny into their own hands. The great event of September 9 (note: referring to Bulgaria's Liberation Day), like the dawn of a new life for the Bulgarian people, will forever be closely linked to the brilliant name of Georgi Dimitrov.
    The honor and merit of Georgi Dimitrov far exceeded the borders of Bulgaria. The obituary regarding Dimitrov's death, issued by the great Stalin and sixteen other Soviet party and government leaders, stated: "The working people of the world have lost in the death of Dimitrov a fervent fighter who devoted his entire heroic life to the cause of the working class—the cause of communism—in selfless struggle. The death of Dimitrov is a major loss for the entire international working class and communist movement, and for all fighters for lasting peace and people's democracy. His selfless fighting spirit in the ranks of the working class movement, his boundless loyalty to the great doctrine of Lenin-Stalin, earned him the love of the working people of the world."
    Georgi Dimitrov's heroism and brilliant victory in the Leipzig Trial showed the people of the world that he was a true revolutionary of the Lenin-Stalin type. He inflicted the first moral and political fatal blow to the savage Hitlerism. In the Leipzig Trial, the German fascists attempted to place the international communist movement in the position of the accused. Georgi Dimitrov, with his fearless actions, turned the trial into an indictment of German fascism. He exposed the mask of the fascist provocateurs, and he denounced their despicable shamelessness before a shocked humanity. "Comrade Georgi Dimitrov's speech"—"Pravda" wrote—"occupies an important place in the history of the international proletariat's struggle against the filthy crimes of the ruling class. This is not only an accusation that makes the provocateurs infamous, but also a passionate call to struggle."
    After being elected General Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in 1935, Georgi Dimitrov became Stalin's closest assistant in organizing all the democratic and progressive forces in the world to fight against fascism. "He waged an unyielding struggle to establish and consolidate the united front of the proletariat and the people against fascism, and against the war that was being prepared by the heads of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists. He tirelessly called on the working people of all countries to unite around the Communist Party in order to block the path of the fascist aggressors.
    Dimitrov carried out tremendous work in the ranks of the international communist movement, teaching the leading cadres of the communist parties of various countries to be loyal to the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and loyal to the cause of defending the interests of the masses of their own people."
    (Excerpt from the obituary of Dimitrov issued by the Soviet party and government leaders)
    Many leaders of the communist parties of various countries recall with gratitude the time they spent with Georgi Dimitrov when they sought his advice.
    "All those who know Georgi Dimitrov well (and I have enjoyed this privilege for twenty-five years)," said Maurice Thorez, the leader of the French Communist Party, "will cherish the characteristics of this great warrior and revolutionary: kindness, patience, boundless energy, and unwavering confidence in the working class."
    "We have learned a lot from this great man," said Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, "We have learned to believe in our principles, the logic and accuracy of our ideas, to learn tenacious resistance, love for progress, love for the people, and infinite loyalty to the cause of the proletariat and the socialist revolution; the Soviet Union today is precisely the steadfast defender of this revolution."
    This is how the leaders of the international communist movement spoke of Georgi Dimitrov, they listened to his historical report at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, and were honored to work and struggle together with him.
    After many years of exile, Georgi Dimitrov returned to his motherland in November 1945. At his first meeting with the working people after returning to the country, he gave a speech that was permeated with a true spirit of patriotism: "Twenty-two years have passed since I left the territory of Bulgaria. You will not doubt me if I tell you that, throughout this period, wherever I was, whatever I was doing, I never ceased for a minute to care about the Bulgarian people, about its future, about its happiness and well-being, and I never ceased for a minute to fight for these."
    After returning to Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov, with his characteristic energy and Bolshevik tenacity, immediately began to consolidate and complete the work of the September 9th victory. Under his strong leadership, the internal and external reactionaries who attempted to hinder the consolidation of the young people's regime suffered a fatal blow.
    Thanks to his far-sightedness on national politics and the great assistance given to Bulgaria by the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian state was able to reliably extricate itself from difficult circumstances in the complex issues of successively signing the armistice agreement and the peace treaty. Due to the traitorous policies of the fascist rulers, Bulgaria, on the verge of extreme and terrible destruction, broke out of the international isolation in which she had fallen on the eve of September 9th, and signed a peace treaty; according to this treaty, she preserved the integrity of her borders and established national independence. In those difficult days for Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov demonstrated the noble qualities of an enlightened statesman: he made a profound analysis of the specific circumstances in which the political movement was being conducted at that time, and skillfully combined the Marxist revolutionary principles with this analysis.
    The People's Republic of Bulgaria was established under the direct leadership of Georgi Dimitrov. On September 7, 1946, in his speech to the Bulgarian people on the eve of the national referendum on the issue of Bulgaria's state system, he pointed out that one of the most fundamental characteristics of people's democracy is the active participation of the masses in the management of state affairs. He said: "What is being said here is how to prepare the masses of the people to realize the idea of the republic, because without the conscious and active participation of the masses of the people, it is simply impossible to build a People's Republic."
    The drafting and repeated revisions of the draft constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, until it was finally passed by the National Assembly, were carried out with the direct participation of Georgi Dimitrov. The constitution in fact not only reflected the achievements that the Bulgarian people had made in struggle over the years, but also reflected the characteristics of Bulgaria's gradual transition from capitalism to socialist society. Therefore, after this perfect constitution was passed, Dimitrov called it a product that was connected by blood to the Bulgarian people, and it was correctly named the Dimitrov Constitution by the Bulgarian people.
    In the political report of the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Georgi Dimitrov provided the most important theoretical basis for the essence and role of the people's democratic state, pointing out that this is one of the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said: "The system of people's democracy embodies the rule of the workers under the leadership of the working class, and this system, under the existing historical conditions, as experience has already proven, can and must successfully play the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat in eliminating capitalist components and organizing the socialist economy."
    This theoretical analysis, which fully conforms to the Lenin-Stalin doctrine on state building, is a major and valuable contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. Georgi Dimitrov was an enthusiastic and unwavering fighter and standard-bearer for the friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. He taught the Bulgarian people to constantly strengthen and consolidate the friendship with the great Soviet people, which is an important condition for guaranteeing Bulgaria's national independence and the prosperous development of the national economy and culture. He said at the Fifth Party Congress: "Any tendency to weaken cooperation with the Soviet Union leads to opposition to the foundations of people's democracy within our country."
    The Soviet Union today is the mainstay of all progressive movements. Without the Soviet Union, the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism would not be possible. As early as 1937, Georgi Dimitrov said: "In the current international environment, there is no and cannot be a second correct standard other than the relationship with the Soviet Union to determine who is a friend of the working class and socialism, and who is an enemy; who is a supporter of democracy and peace, and who is an opponent." To break away from the Soviet Union is to inevitably walk into the camp of the reactionaries and imperialism.
    The Tito-Rankovic gang is the most prominent example of this, this group was revealed to be actually the running dogs of Anglo-American imperialism. Tito and his servants, pretending to be communists and intending to build socialism in their own country, cannot deceive anyone, let alone the people of Yugoslavia. The Tito elements have never been sincere in their attitude towards the Soviet Union, and since breaking off relations with the Soviet Union, they have immediately become open tools of international reaction and enemies of the working class and their own people.
    Georgi Dimitrov was a staunch and consistent fighter who upheld proletarian internationalism and opposed corrupt bourgeois nationalism. He firmly believed that without internationalism, there could be no genuine proletarian revolutionary movement.
    Georgi Dimitrov taught that, according to the great doctrines of Lenin and Stalin on state building and economic construction under the system of proletarian dictatorship, if the people's regime cannot establish its own economic foundation in time, then the political achievements won by the working class will be in vain; if the economic foundation of capitalism is not eliminated in advance, then the people's democratic regime cannot be thoroughly consolidated.
    "Only by tirelessly advancing along the socialist road can the people's democratic countries be consolidated and fulfill their historical tasks. If the people's democratic regimes once cease their struggle against the exploiting classes and no longer exclude and suppress capitalist elements, then they will inevitably gain the upper hand, and they will not only undermine the foundations of the new democracy, but will also overthrow the people's democratic regimes."
    It was precisely from this fundamental principle that Georgi Dimitrov, with the clarity of Lenin and Stalin, delineated the basic line of Bulgaria's economic development after the establishment and consolidation of the people's democratic regime, which leads to the complete construction of socialism and even communism through the construction of domestic socialist economic and cultural foundations.
    Georgi Dimitrov told the Bulgarian people to rely on friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, to constantly learn from the experience of the Soviet Communist Party, and to advance smoothly along the path of Bulgaria's complete socialist victory.
    Four years have passed since Georgi Dimitrov's death. If the Bulgarian people were to summarize their work achievements during this period, they could say: it has been done very well. The Bulgarian people have achieved great success in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.
    This shows that the path taken by the Bulgarian people is correct, and this is precisely the path indicated by Georgi Dimitrov.
    In the past four years, the Bulgarian people have proved that they can bravely and confidently follow Dimitrov's path. This is the guarantee of their future victory.
    Comrade Chervenkov said in his oath speech at Georgi Dimitrov's funeral: "The death of Georgi Dimitrov is an extremely serious loss for our people. All honest hearts in our country feel and experience this loss... But his cause is alive. It lives in the strong ranks of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which he founded and educated, which is strong, united, and as solid as a rock. It lives in our glorious working class, laboring peasants, people's intellectuals, and their unbreakable unity as embodied in the Fatherland Front. This cause lives in the youth of the people, it lives in the hearts of the workers who are loyal to their motherland."
    The sincerely grateful Bulgarian people have built many commemorative statues to commemorate Georgi Dimitrov's immortal honor. But the greatest monument that the people have built for their leader, which does not fear any storms, will be tomorrow's happy socialist Bulgaria. This monument will embody Georgi Dimitrov's ideal—the ideal for which he dedicated his rich and beautiful life. In his words, this ideal was the meaning and content of his entire life.

    遵循季米特洛夫的道路前进
    保加利亚人民共和国外交部部长  明乔·涅伊切夫
    保加利亚劳动人民的领袖和公认的亲爱导师、保加利亚共产党的组织者和领导者、祖国阵线的创始人、国际工人运动的杰出活动家、反对法西斯主义和反对战争的坚强战士、保苏两国永远牢不可破的友谊的旗手——乔治·季米特洛夫于四年前与世长辞了。
    乔治·季米特洛夫的逝世，使得保加利亚共产党不可弥补地丧失了一位伟大的组织者、领导者和鼓舞者。在五十年的岁月中，季米特洛夫把自己的毕生精力，坚强革命家所具有的深远才智和一颗炽热的心，都奉献给保加利亚工人阶级斗争的组织工作，奉献给创建工人阶级政党的工作上了。作为列宁和斯大林的忠实的学生，他在新的环境中，进行了党的改造和重建工作，旨在使它成为崭新的马克思列宁主义的政党，使它善于把劳动人民团结在自己的旗帜之下，引导他们为反抗资本主义剥削和帝国主义压迫而进行斗争，直到社会主义和共产主义的完全胜利。“工人阶级斗争的历史中，我国近五十年来社会主义和共产主义运动中，没有一个重要事件不同乔治·季米特洛夫同志的伟大名字和他积极的组织和领导活动紧密地联系着的”，保加利亚共产党中央委员会等在他逝世的讣闻中这样写道。
    乔治·季米特洛夫的逝世，使保加利亚人民失去了曾经领导他们进行反对保皇法西斯反动势力和德国帝国主义的艰苦斗争的他们的最忠实的儿子和领导者。祖国阵线的倡议人和创始者乔治·季米特洛夫同志在团结保加利亚人民一切进步和民主力量的事业中，建立了伟大的功绩。由于光荣的苏联军队对希特勒匪军的辉煌胜利，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的鼓舞和领导之下，推翻了保皇法西斯政权，并且在历史上第一次把自己的命运掌握在自己手中。九月九日（按系保加利亚的解放日）的伟大事件，正像是保加利亚人民新生命的曙光一般，将永远同乔治·季米特洛夫的光辉名字紧密地联结在一起。
    乔治·季米特洛夫的荣誉和功绩，是远远地超越了保加利亚的国境的。由伟大的斯大林和其他十六位苏联党政领袖发布的关于季米特洛夫逝世的讣闻中写道：“全世界劳动人民因季米特洛夫的逝世而丧失了一个把全部英雄的生命为工人阶级的事业——共产主义的事业而作无我奋斗的热诚斗士。季米特洛夫的逝世，是整个国际工人阶级与共产主义运动，是一切争取持久和平与人民民主的斗士的重大损失。他在工人阶级运动行列中的大公无私的斗争精神，他对于列宁—斯大林伟大学说的无限忠诚，使他博得了全世界劳动人民的热爱。”
    乔治·季米特洛夫在来比锡审讯中所表现的英雄气概和所得到的光辉胜利，向全世界人民表明了他是列宁斯大林型的真正革命家。他使野蛮的希特勒主义遭受了第一个道义上和政治上的致命打击。在来比锡审讯中，德国法西斯分子企图把国际共产主义运动置于被告的地位。乔治·季米特洛夫用自己大无畏的行动把审讯转变为对德国法西斯主义的控告。他揭破了法西斯挑拨者的假面具，他在受震动的全人类面前痛斥他们的卑鄙无耻。“乔治·季米特洛夫同志的演说”——“真理报”写道——“在国际无产阶级同统治阶级卑污的罪恶行为的斗争历史上，占着重要的位置。这不仅是使得挑拨者臭名远扬的控诉，而且是号召斗争的热情召唤。”
    一九三五年当选为共产国际执行委员会总书记之后，乔治·季米特洛夫在组织世界上一切民主进步力量进行反法西斯斗争的工作中，成了斯大林的最亲密的助手。“他曾为建立与巩固无产阶级与人民反法西斯主义的统一阵线，和反对德、日、意法西斯魁首所正准备的战争而进行不屈不挠的斗争，他曾毫不厌倦地号召一切国家的劳动人民团结在共产党的周围，以便堵塞法西斯侵略者的道路。
    季米特洛夫曾在国际共产主义运动的行列中执行巨大的工作，教导各国共产党的领导干部忠于马克思—列宁主义的伟大学说，忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则、忠于保卫他们本国人民群众利益的事业。”
    （摘自苏联党政领袖关于季米特洛夫逝世的讣闻）
    各国共产党的许多领袖们，都怀着感激的心情，回忆着当他们向乔治·季米特洛夫求教的时候，同他在一起所度过的时光。
    “凡是深知乔治·季米特洛夫的人们（而我在二十五年的时期中一直享有着这种殊遇）”，法国共产党领袖莫里斯·多列士说，“都会珍视这位伟大战士和革命家的特性：和善，耐性，无限充沛的精力，对工人阶级毫不动摇的信心。”
    “我们向这位伟人学会了很多的东西”意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂说，“我们学会了相信我们的原则、思想的逻辑性和精确性，学会了顽强的抵抗、对进步的热爱、对人民的热爱和对无产阶级及社会主义革命事业的无限忠诚；今天的苏联正是这个革命的坚定不移的捍卫者。”
    国际共产主义的领导人就是这样地谈论乔治·季米特洛夫的，他们在共产国际第七次代表大会上听取了他的历史性的报告，并且很荣幸地同他在一起工作和共同斗争。
    过了许多年的流亡生活之后，乔治·季米特洛夫于一九四五年十一月回到了祖国。回国后初次同劳动人民会面时，他发表了一篇渗透着真正的爱国主义精神的演说：“从我离开保加利亚的国土的时候起，已经过去二十二年了。你们不会怀疑，如果我向你们说，在这整个时期，无论我在什么地方，无论我干什么，我从来一分钟也没有停止关心保加利亚人民，关心它的将来、关心它的幸福与美满生活，而且一分钟也没有停止为争取这些而斗争。”
    回到保加利亚之后，乔治·季米特洛夫带着自己素有的精力和布尔什维克的顽强性。马上着手进行巩固和完成九月九日胜利的工作。在他坚强的领导之下，使企图阻挠年轻的人民政权的巩固的内外反动派，受到了致命的打击。
    由于他对国家政治的远见和苏联给予保加利亚的巨大援助，保加利亚国家在先后签订停战协定与和约的错综复杂的问题上，得以可靠地摆脱了困难的境遇。由于法西斯统治者的卖国政策，在面临极端可怕的覆灭前夕，保加利亚却冲出了九月九日前夜她所陷入的国际孤立的罗网，并且签订了和约；根据这个和约，她保全了自己边境的完整，确立了民族独立。在保加利亚那些困难的日子里，乔治·季米特洛夫表现了英明的国家活动家的崇高品质：他对当时进行政治运动所处的具体情况作了深刻的分析，并把马克思主义的革命原则性同这种分析巧妙地结合起来。
    保加利亚人民共和国是在乔治·季米特洛夫直接领导之下建立的。一九四六年九月七日，他在关于保加利亚国家政体问题全民投票前夕对保加利亚人民的演说中指出，人民民主最基本的特征之一——就是群众积极参加国家的管理工作。他说：“这里所说的是如何准备人民群众去实现共和国的思想，因为，如果没有人民群众自觉地和积极地参加，简直不可能建设人民共和国。”
    保加利亚人民共和国宪法草案的拟定、多次修改，直到最后经国民议会通过，都是在乔治·季米特洛夫直接参加之下进行的。宪法事实上不仅反映了保加利亚人民多年来在斗争中所取得的成就，而且也反映了保加利亚由资本主义逐渐过渡到社会主义社会的特点。因此，这个完善的宪法在通过之后，季米特洛夫便称它为与保加利亚人民有血肉联系的产物，并被保加利亚人民正确地命名为季米特洛夫宪法。
    在保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会的政治报告里，乔治·季米特洛夫提供了关于人民民主国家的实质和作用的最重要的理论基础，指出这就是无产阶级专政的形式之一。他说：“人民民主制度体现着在工人阶级领导底下的劳动者的统治，这个制度在现存的历史诸条件下，如像经验已经证明的，能够而且必须在消灭资本主义成份和组织社会主义经济上成功地起着无产阶级专政的作用。”
    这一理论分析，完全符合列宁、斯大林关于国家建设的学说，是对马克思—列宁主义宝库的一个重大和珍贵的贡献。乔治·季米特洛夫是保苏两国友谊的热烈的、始终不渝的斗士和旗手。他教导保加利亚人民不断地去加强和巩固同伟大的苏联人民的友谊，这是保证保加利亚民族独立和国家经济文化繁荣发展的重要条件。他在第五次党代表大会上说道：“任何削弱同苏联合作的倾向，都是导向反对我们的国家内人民民主的基础的。”
    苏联在今天是一切进步运动的支柱。没有苏联，争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争就没有可能。远在一九三七年，乔治·季米特洛夫就曾说过：“在现今的国际环境中，除了对苏联的关系之外，没有也不可能有第二种正确的标准，来判定谁是工人阶级、社会主义的朋友，谁是敌人；谁是民主、和平的拥护者，谁是反对者。”脱离苏联，就不可避免地要走进反动派和帝国主义的阵营。
    铁托—兰科维奇匪帮就是这种最显著的例子，这个集团被揭发出来实际是英美帝国主义的走狗。铁托和他的仆从们，诡称是共产党人，并且打算在自己国内建设社会主义，是骗不了任何人的，更毋须说南斯拉夫的人民了。铁托分子对苏联的态度从来不是真诚的，自从与苏联断绝关系之后，他们马上变成了国际反动派的公开工具，变成了工人阶级和本国人民的敌人。
    乔治·季米特洛夫是拥护无产阶级国际主义，反对腐朽的资产阶级的民族主义底坚决的和始终如一的战士。他深信：没有国际主义，就不可能有真正的无产阶级革命运动。
    乔治·季米特洛夫教导说：根据列宁、斯大林关于无产阶级专政制度下国家建设和经济建设的伟大学说，如果人民政权不能及时地建立自己的经济基础，那么工人阶级所争得的政治成果即将化为乌有；如果不事先消灭资本主义的经济基础，那么就不能够彻底地巩固人民民主政权。
    “只有不倦地沿着社会主义的道路前进，人民民主国家才能巩固起来，才能完成历史的任务。如果人民民主政权一旦停止了同剥削阶级的斗争，不再排除和压制资本主义成分，那么它们必然要占上风，它们不仅要破坏新民主的基础，而且会使人民民主政权覆灭。”
    正是从这个基本原理出发，乔治·季米特洛夫具有列宁、斯大林那样的明确性，描画出了在人民民主政权建立和巩固之后保加利亚经济发展的基本路线，这个基本路线是通过国内社会主义的经济基础和文化基础的建成，引向社会主义乃至共产主义的完全建成。
    乔治·季米特洛夫告诉保加利亚人民，要依靠与苏联和各人民民主国家的友好合作，经常地学习苏联共产党的经验，沿着保加利亚社会主义彻底胜利的途径，顺利地前进。
    自从乔治·季米特洛夫逝世以来，四年过去了。如果对这一时期内自己的工作成绩作一总结的话，保加利亚人民可以说：工作得很好。保加利亚人民在政治生活、经济生活和文化生活各方面，都获得了很大的成就。
    这表明了保加利亚人民所走的道路是正确的，而这正是乔治·季米特洛夫所指示的道路。
    在过去四年中，保加利亚人民证明了：它能够勇敢地和满怀信心地遵循着季米特洛夫的道路前进。这就是它今后的胜利的保证。
    契尔文科夫同志在乔治·季米特洛夫葬礼上的宣誓演说中说道：“乔治·季米特洛夫的逝世，对于我国人民是一种异常严重的损失。我国一切正直的心灵都感觉到并体验到这个损失。……但他的事业是活着的。它活在他所创立和教育的、强大而统一的、坚如磐石的保加利亚共产党的坚强的队伍中。它活在我国光荣的工人阶级、劳动农民、人民知识分子以及体现为祖国阵线的他们牢不可破的团结之中。这个事业活在人民的青年之中，它活在忠诚于自己祖国的劳动者的心中。”
    衷心感念的保加利亚人民建立了许多纪念像，来纪念乔治·季米特洛夫永垂不朽的荣誉。但是人民给自己的领袖所建立的最伟大的，不惧怕任何暴风雨的纪念碑，将是明天幸福的社会主义的保加利亚。这个纪念碑将体现乔治·季米特洛夫的理想——为了这个理想，他献出了自己丰富美丽的生命。照他的话来说，这个理想就是他自己全部生命的意义和内容。
