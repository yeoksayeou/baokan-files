Let Electric Machines Replace Them
—A Record of Improved Tools at the Jiawang Engineering Company Carpentry Shop
Ding Shude

In a corner of the Jiawang mining area, there were originally several dilapidated thatched sheds, housing many carpenters who, for over forty years, had been using heavy hand tools, doing arduous manual labor. Sawing, planing, chopping, all relied on human power. Whether making a window sash or repairing a door panel, it required a great deal of effort. Two workers, sawing eighty feet of round timber in ten hours, would return home with aching backs and sore limbs, unable even to eat their meals. Wu Shuian, the head of the carpentry shop, had been working in this condition for a full twenty years.

With the beginning of the great construction of the motherland, this workshop has taken on a brand-new appearance. The original thatched sheds have been replaced with large tile-roofed buildings. Upon entering, one can hear the deafening sound of motors. Inside, many electric machines are set up. A thick piece of wood, when placed on them, is cut into two sections in less than a second or two. A window lattice, when placed on them, has a small groove cut in less than a second. In particular, the newly installed electric tenon-cutting machine has almost replaced 70 percent of the manual operations in the entire shop. But these machines were not bought from the outside, but created by the workers with their own wisdom; they are also the achievements of the recent mass mechanization movement. The rapid construction of these machines is inseparable from the leadership of Wu Shuian, the shop foreman.

Wu Shuian is a skilled worker with more than twenty years of experience. He has a high level of skill in making wooden products. Because of his active production, he was promoted to foreman of the carpentry shop in 1950. At that time, he was very reluctant to do it. He thought, how can I be a foreman without any education? But the masses supported him, and he had no choice but to accept. So he made up his mind: If I'm going to do it, I'll do it! Initially, he was busy on the construction site all day long. When the leadership assigned tasks to the carpentry shop, he would call everyone together for a meeting, read out the superior's instructions, and immediately pick up his tools and start working. Later, he joined a political study class and received communist education, which made him more aware of his heavy responsibilities and the need to lead the workshop in production effectively. At that time, he felt that the carpentry shop's production tools were too backward. How great it would be if all the work could be done by machines, but he didn't know where to start.

In August of last year, the capital construction tasks in the mining area increased. The carpentry shop, with a total of only a hundred people, was responsible for supplying doors, windows and other building materials to four work areas. Although the workers had high enthusiasm for labor, the tools were backward. It took four workers to make a window sash, and the carpenters always lagged behind the bricklayers. Wu Shuian and the workers were very anxious. At that time, they had to cooperate with the trade union to mobilize the masses to find solutions and promote advanced experiences. This improved work efficiency, but the workers were very tired every day, which was obviously not sustainable. Wu Shuian was even more anxious, so he discussed with the veteran workers in several carpentry groups to see if they could use their brains to improve the tools. So the workers automatically held meetings after work to study and improve the tools. Wu Shuian also attended the workers' research meetings after work every day. The young worker Luo Zhaofa noticed that the most difficult part of making doors and windows was mortising, so he spent several days drawing a blueprint for a double mortising machine. He planned to use a wooden frame with two saw blades suspended above it, which could be rotated up and down to cut the mortises for the windows. Wu Shuian carefully studied his blueprint, provided some suggestions, and asked Luo Zhaofa to make it. The model was made and tested in the shop, and the workers said, "It works!" Two days later, the veteran worker Cai Bingshen also created a grooving tool, because grooving on doors and windows was also a very laborious task. To cut a groove, you first had to chisel it out, and then plane it. He created a grooving saw, using a shaft with a circular saw blade on top. When the shaft rotated, the blade would also rotate, and the wood could be placed on it to cut the groove. Wu Shuian carefully examined the two models and felt that they were good, but they still relied on manual labor. It would be best to convert them into electric machines.

At the end of December last year, Wu Shuian went to Jinan to visit a large-scale woodworking factory. He was greatly inspired and bought a saw blade from a hardware store to bring back to the mine, preparing to further improve the production tools.

However, parts were scarce. The foreman and several active backbones used Sundays to make belt pulleys and spindles out of wood. Without screws, they went to the scrap iron pile in the electromechanical shop to scavenge. The next day, the electric tool was installed. That night, the machine could only pull. After continuous improvement, now it can do mortising, tenoning, material pulling, and reduction. The efficiency of reduction was immediately increased twenty times. Tenoning used to require one piece at a time, which was very slow. Now thirty pieces can be tenoned at once. After the successful installation of this first electric tool, it inspired other workers in the carpentry shop to continuously create another five types of electric tools. In this way, what was originally a backward carpentry shop has become a semi-mechanized workshop.

    让电动机器来代替它们
    ——记贾汪工程公司木工场的改进工具
    丁淑德
    在贾汪矿区的一角，原来有几座破旧的茅草棚，里面住着很多木工，四十多年以来他们用的都是笨重的手工工具，做着沉重的苦活，拉、锯、刨、砍，全靠人工。不论是造扇窗子，或是修一块门板，都得费很大的力气。两个工人在十小时拉好八十尺的圆木头，回到家里，腰酸骨痛，连饭都吃不下。木场场长吴水安，就在这种情况下，整整的干了二十多年。
    随着祖国大建设的开始，这个场房也有了崭新的面目。原来的茅草棚变成了大瓦房，一走进门，就听得见震耳的马达响声，里面架设着很多电动的机器，一块粗壮的木头放上去，不到一两秒钟，就截成两段。一个窗户的格子放上去，不到一秒钟的时间，就拉出一个小槽。特别是他们新近安装起来的电动削楞大剪口，几乎代替了全场百分之七十的人力操作。但这些机器都不是从外面买来的，而是工人用自己的智慧创造出来的；也是他们最近开展的群众性机械化运动中所获得的成果。这些机器能够很快的造成和该场的场长吴水安的领导是分不开的。
    吴水安是一个有二十多年工龄的技术工人，他在制造木器上有很高的技艺。因为他生产积极，一九五○年被提升为木场的场长。当时，他很不愿意干，他想没有文化怎么能够当场长呢？但是群众拥护他，不干又不行，他就打定主意：干就干吧！当初他成天在工地上忙碌着，领导上向木场分配了任务，他就召集大家开个会，把上级的任务宣读一遍，立即拿起家伙干活去了。以后他加入了政治学习班，受到了共产主义的教育，才更加觉悟到自己责任很重，要很好的领导工场生产。那时他感觉到木场的生产工具太落后了，要是干活都靠机器，该多么好，可就是不晓得从何处下手。
    去年八月间，矿区的基本建设任务加重了，木场总共只有一百多人，要负责供应四个工区的门窗等建筑器材；工人的劳动热情虽高，但因为工具落后，造一扇窗户就要花费四个工，木工老是赶不上瓦工。吴水安和工人都很着急。当时只得配合工会，发动群众找窍门，推广先进经验。这样工作效率是提高了，但是工人每天都很疲劳，显见是不能持久的。吴水安心里更加焦急，他就和几个木工小组的老年工人研究，看能不能在工具上动点脑筋。于是工人们就自动的在下班后开会研究，改进工具。吴水安每天下班后，也去参加工人的研究会。青年工人罗兆发，看见在制造门窗时，顶费力的就是开榫，他就花了好几天的工夫，画了一个双条开榫机的图样，他准备用一个木架子，上面吊两个锯条，上下一转动就可以开出窗户的榫来。吴水安把他的图样仔细的研究了一番，又提供了些意见，叫罗兆发去做。模型造好了，拿到场里试验，工人都说：“管！”过了两天，老年工人蔡炳臣也创造了一个拉槽的工具，因为在门窗上拉槽也是个非常费力的事，拉一个槽先得用凿子凿好了后，还得用刨子刨，他就创造了一个拉槽锯，用一个轴，上面放一个圆的锯刃，轴一转，刃子也就跟着转，木头放上去，就能拉出槽来。吴水安把两个模型拿来仔细察看，总觉得好是好，但还得靠人力，最好是把它改为电动的机器。
    去年十二月底，吴水安等到济南去参观大型木工厂，受到了很大的启示，他就向五金店里买了一个锯片回到矿上，准备把生产工具更进一步加以改进。
    但是零件很缺乏，场长和几个积极骨干，又利用星期天用木头做皮带轮、地轴，没有螺丝，就到机电场废铁堆里拣，第二天，电动工具就安好了。当天晚上实验，这机器还只能拉，经过不断改进，现在，开榫、腰肩、拉料、减口都行了。减口的效率一下就提高二十倍，腰肩从前要一根根的腰，很慢，现在一下子可以腰三十根。这第一座电动工具安装成功后，又鼓舞着木场其他工人连续创造出另外五种电动的工具。这样，本来是一个落后的木场，就变为一个半机械化的工场了。
