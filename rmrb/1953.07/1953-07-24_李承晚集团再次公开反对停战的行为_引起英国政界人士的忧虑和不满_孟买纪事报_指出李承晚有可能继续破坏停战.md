Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd Dispatch: London News: The Syngman Rhee group's renewed public opposition to the armistice has caused concern and dissatisfaction among British politicians.

    Members of the British House of Commons questioned Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler, who is acting as British Prime Minister, on this matter on the 22nd. Former Labor government Prime Minister Attlee asked: "Does this latest regrettable news indicate the urgent need to convene a United Nations General Assembly as soon as possible, because currently—I say this without exaggeration—Syngman Rhee and his government have a tendency to disregard their promises?" Former Labor government Deputy Foreign Minister Younger said: It is "very unfortunate" that the Korean Armistice Agreement is being threatened by Syngman Rhee's "arrogant behavior" on the eve of its signing. He said that the anxiety that war will break out again after the armistice is mainly due to the attitude of South Korea, not due to the Korean-Chinese side. He believes that it is reasonable for the Korean-Chinese side to ask for certain guarantees. He said: "Whether these guarantees will take effect depends on what we, the United Nations, are prepared to do, and not on whether we think we have received written guarantees or other guarantees from Syngman Rhee." Former Labor government Secretary of State for War Strachey said: Everything should be done to prevent Syngman Rhee from "undermining the realization of the armistice," which is "absolutely necessary." Labor MP Wyatt asked: "Shouldn't we make it clear to South Korea that if South Korea does not comply with the armistice terms, British troops and UN troops can no longer stay in Korea to help the South Koreans. Isn't now the time to say these things?" He also asked:
    "What guarantees and safeguards has Syngman Rhee given to the Allied forces to ensure that he will abide by the terms of the armistice agreement signed by the Allied forces with North Korea and the Chinese Communist forces?"
    Butler said in response to these inquiries that the consequences of the Syngman Rhee government's renewed public opposition to the armistice could be "obviously very serious." He said: "When I entered the House of Commons, I felt that I should report this news to everyone, and I think I would be wrong if I did not immediately notify the House of Commons of this news." He said that the British government will "use its full influence" to prevent Syngman Rhee from undermining the conclusion of the armistice agreement.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd Dispatch: New Delhi News: The Indian "Bombay Chronicle" pointed out on the 22nd that Syngman Rhee may continue to sabotage the armistice. The newspaper said: "We earnestly hope that the armistice will finally be formally realized. But the difficulties will not disappear with the signing of the armistice. Even in the transition period from armistice to final peace, there are still things to worry about. For example, Syngman Rhee is said to be opposed to Indian troops setting foot on the 'sovereign' territory of South Korea, and even opposed to members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission going to South Korea." The newspaper said, "There is nothing to guarantee that he will accept, for example, a solution regarding the future of prisoners of war. And there is certainly nothing to guarantee that Syngman Rhee will accept any political agreement reached between the Allied forces and the Communist side, nor can it be guaranteed that he will continue to 'obey' in the future."

    李承晚集团再次公开反对停战的行为
    引起英国政界人士的忧虑和不满
    “孟买纪事报”指出李承晚有可能继续破坏停战
    【新华社二十三日讯】伦敦消息：李承晚集团再次公开反对停战的行为，引起了英国政界人士的忧虑和不满。
    英国下议院议员二十二日纷纷就此事向代理英国首相职务的财政大臣巴特勒提出质询。前工党政府首相艾德礼问道：“这个最新的令人遗憾的消息，是否表示有尽速召开联合国大会的迫切需要，因为目前——我说得并不过分——李承晚与他的政府有不遵守他们的诺言的趋势。”前工党政府外交副大臣杨格说：朝鲜停战协定于签字之际竟将因李承晚的“狂妄行为”而遭到威胁，这是“非常不幸”的事情。他说，人们担心停战后再度发生战争的忧虑心情，主要是由于南朝鲜的态度而产生的，而不是由于朝中方面产生的。他认为，朝中方面要求给予某些保证，是很合理的。他说：“这些保证能不能生效决定于我们联合国准备怎么办，而不决定于我们认为我们已经得到李承晚的书面保证或其他保证。”前工党政府陆军大臣斯特拉彻说：应该采取一切措施来防止李承晚“破坏停战的实现”，这是“绝对必要的”。工党议员怀阿特问道：“我们应该向南朝鲜清楚说明，如果南朝鲜不遵守停战条款，英国军队与联合国军队不能再留在朝鲜帮助南朝鲜人。现在难道不是说这些话的时候了吗？”他又问道：
    “李承晚究竟向联军提出了什么样的保证与保障，来担保他会遵守联军与北朝鲜和中共军队签订的停战协定的条款？”
    巴特勒在答复这些质询时说，李承晚政府再次公开反对停战的消息可能产生的后果，“显然是很严重的”。他说：“当我进入下议院的时候，我便感到我应该把我看到的这个消息报告给大家，而且我认为，假使我不立即把这个消息通知下议院，我便错了。”他说，英国政府将“运用其全部影响”来防止李承晚破坏停战协定的缔结。
    【新华社二十三日讯】新德里消息：印度“孟买纪事报”二十二日指出：李承晚有可能继续破坏停战。该报说：“我们热切希望，停战终于会正式实现。但是困难将不会随着停战的签订而消失。甚至于在停战到最后和平这个过渡期间，也并不是没有令人焦虑的事。例如，据说李承晚就在反对印度军队踏上南朝鲜的‘有主权的’国土，甚至反对中立国委员会的委员到南朝鲜去。”该报说，“并没有东西保证他一定接受譬如说关于战俘的前途的解决办法。并且肯定地没有东西保证李承晚将接受联军方面和共方之间达成的任何政治协议，也不能保证他以后会继续‘听话’。”
