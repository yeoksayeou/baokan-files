Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 26th: Since the beginning of July, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front have defeated numerous enemy incursions and harassments, and launched counter-attacks in many areas, achieving significant victories. From July 1st to July 18th, the Korean-Chinese People's forces annihilated over 34,000 Rhee Syngman puppet troops and over 6,000 American aggressor troops who constantly provoked our forces.

In early July, the Rhee Syngman gang arrogantly clamored for a "Northward March," and the Rhee puppet troops constantly intruded into our positions. The Rhee puppet troops entrenched on Bai Ling Island in the West Sea carried out three landing incursions towards Hailongli and W鹊 Island, 15 kilometers southeast of Mengjinpu. The enemy troops on both banks of the North Han River constantly invaded our forces. Under the heavy blows of our army, the enemy troops all collapsed and retreated.

Our forces launched many counter-attacks in various areas of the front. On the night of the 13th, our forces launched a powerful counter-attack south of Kim Sung, east of Kimhwa, and west of the North Han River. In one day and night, our forces broke through the heavily fortified positions of the Rhee puppet troops, bravely pursued and encircled the fleeing enemy, expanding the occupied area by 170 square kilometers, and annihilating 26,089 enemy troops. The enemy then painstakingly reorganized its remnants, and, adding several divisions drawn from other fronts, launched counter-attacks against our forces. Under the staunch resistance of our forces, the enemy continued to increase its casualties significantly, but still could not cross our new defensive line by even one step. Our forces are now continuing to strike back at the counter-attacking enemy in the newly occupied positions.

Our forces also carried out more than 20 counter-attacks in other areas of the front, eliminating a large number of enemy troops and capturing ten enemy positions. In one counter-attack on the night of the 16th, east of Hill 811.7 southwest of Mundengli on the eastern front, our forces completely annihilated three complete companies and most of another company of the 12th Division of the Rhee puppet troops defending the area. In addition, our forces also carried out several victorious counter-attacks south of Gao Cheng, south of Yu Yin Mountain on the eastern front, near Shi Xiandong in the central sector, and near Gao Yangdai in the western sector.

According to preliminary statistics, the results of the Korean-Chinese People's forces from July 1st to July 18th are as follows:

One, a total of 40,874 enemy troops were annihilated, including more than 34,000 puppet troops and more than 6,000 American troops. Enemy troops annihilated by our forces in their entirety include: one complete regiment (the 1st Regiment of the Capital Division) of the Rhee puppet troops, six complete battalions, twelve complete companies, eleven complete platoons, and most of eight battalions and three companies; and all of one howitzer battalion and one rocket artillery platoon, and all of two infantry companies and five infantry platoons of the US military.

Two, 44 tanks, 1 armored vehicle, 273 howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, and other large and small artillery pieces, 4,549 various machine guns and automatic rifles, etc., 416 pieces of various important communication equipment were captured, in addition to 274 vehicles, 1 aircraft, and 30 ammunition depots.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 26th: Our frontline reporter reported the heroic breakthrough of our army's assault team into the defense line of the elite Capital Division of the Rhee puppet troops in the counter-attack launched on the central Korean front.

In a tunnel on the Shangganling front, only 200 meters from the enemy's position, the soldiers of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers excitedly accepted the assault mission - to break into the defense line of the Capital Division of the Rhee puppet troops southwest of Kim Sung. Before their departure, they held a solemn oath-taking ceremony, and the brave assault team members eagerly put forward their combat merit plans. At the end of the oath-taking ceremony, the political instructor of a certain company took out carefully preserved apples from a cloth bag, and each member of the assault team took a bite. These apples were sent by a Korean mother living near the front line. The deep affection of the Korean mother further inspired the fighting spirit of the assault team members.

On the evening of July 13th, the sound of "Fight to the Yalu River" came from the loudspeakers on the enemy's position. It was at this moment that the assault team members of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers quietly walked out of the tunnel with their submachine guns. At 9 o'clock, the commander's order was simultaneously transmitted to various artillery positions through dozens of telephone lines, and countless tons of artillery shells immediately poured down on the enemy positions in the Zhuzi Dongnan Mountain and Xingting Xishan area southwest of Kim Sung. In the earth-shattering explosion of artillery shells, the position of the Capital Division of the Rhee puppet troops turned into a sea of ​​fire.

The infantry attack began, and the assault team members of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers subdued the stubborn enemy with an overwhelming spirit of bravery. In the battle to attack Zhuzi Dongnan Mountain, Cao Jialin shot down more than a dozen enemies with a machine gun. After his right hand and machine gun were damaged by a grenade thrown by the enemy, he still used his injured right hand to fire two grenades, killing five more enemies. Then he picked up a submachine gun from the enemy's corpse and swept at the enemy. Explosives expert Li Shuhe continuously destroyed seven bunkers that had survived our artillery fire. When he was blasting the eighth bunker, his abdomen and legs were injured. He still crawled as close as he could to the enemy's bunker and stuffed a package of explosives into the firing port, but it was pushed out by the enemy with a rifle butt. Li Shuhe immediately swept the firing port of the bunker with a submachine gun, and then stuffed the explosives back in.

With a loud noise, the bunker was finally destroyed. The heroic Li Shuhe also gloriously sacrificed at this time. The assault team members rushed into the gap opened by Li Shuhe, and the stubborn enemy was beaten into a chaotic retreat.

When our army occupied Zhuzi Dongnan Mountain, our troops attacking Xingting Xishan also sent out signals that they had occupied the position.

At this time, another assault team inserted from the west of Zhuzi Dongnan Mountain to the rear of the enemy and occupied the commanding height of 424.2 Hill, the high point on the enemy's retreat route. When the enemies who had been defeated from Zhuzi Dongnan Mountain and Xingting Xishan fled here, our army met them with machine guns. Then, our troops attacking from the front also chased over, attacking from both sides, compressing the remnants into a mountain depression of less than one square kilometer. More than 2,600 soldiers of the 26th Regiment of the Capital Division of the Rhee puppet troops were completely annihilated here. Our army completely broke through the enemy's five-kilometer-wide defense line from Zhuzi Dongnan Mountain to Xingting and advanced six kilometers to the south.

    朝中部队十八天歼敌四万余名
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】七月初以来，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线击败了敌军的许多次进犯和窜扰，并在许多地区展开了反击战，得到了重大胜利。从七月一日到七月十八日为止，朝中人民部队歼灭了不断向我寻衅的李承晚伪军三万四千多名，歼灭了美国侵略军六千多名。
    七月上旬，李承晚匪帮狂妄地高叫“北进”，李伪军不断地窜犯我军阵地。盘据在西海面白翎岛上的李伪军，曾三次向梦金浦东南十五公里海陇里、鸟鹊岛进行登陆窜犯，北汉江两岸敌军更不断向我军侵犯。在我军的沉重打击下，敌军都溃退了。
    我军在前线各个地区发起了许多次反击作战。十三日夜间，我军在金城以南、金化以东、北汉江以西发起了强大的反击战。我军在一昼夜之间就突破了李伪军坚固设防的阵地，勇猛追歼和包围溃逃的敌人，扩展阵地面积一百七十平方公里，歼灭敌人二万六千零八十九名。敌军又费尽力气收拾残部，加上从其他战线上抽调来的几个师，向我军进行反扑。在我军的坚强阻击下，敌人继续增加了大量的伤亡，但是仍旧无法超越我军新防线一步。现在我军正在新占领的阵地上继续打击反扑敌人。
    我军在战线的其他地区亦进行了二十多次反击战，消灭了大批敌人，攻占了敌军阵地十处。仅在十六日夜间东线文登里西南八一一点七高地以东的一次反击战中，我军即全歼守敌李伪军十二师三个整连另一个连的大部。另外，在东线高城以南、鱼隐山以南、中线石岘洞和西线高阳岱附近各地，我军也进行了多次胜利的反击战。
    据初步统计，朝中人民部队七月一日至十八日战果如下：
    一、共歼灭敌军四万零八百七十四名，内伪军三万四千多名，美国军队六千多名。成建制被我军歼灭的敌军有：李伪军一个整团（即首都师第一团）、六个整营、十二个整连、十一个整排及八个营、三个连的大部；有美军一个榴弹炮营、一个火箭炮连全部和两个步兵连、五个步兵排全部。
    二、缴获坦克四十四辆、装甲车一辆、榴弹炮、多管火箭炮及其他各种大小炮二百七十三门，各种机枪、自动步枪等四千五百四十九挺（枝），各种重要通讯器材四百一十六件，另外缴获汽车二百七十四辆、飞机一架、弹药库三十座。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者报道在朝鲜中线展开的反击战中，我军突击队英勇突入李伪军精锐首都师防线的情形。
    上甘岭前线离敌军阵地只有二百公尺的一条坑道里，中国人民志愿军某部战士兴奋地接受了突击任务——突入金城西南李伪军首都师的防线。他们在出发之前，举行一个庄严的出征宣誓大会，勇敢的突击队员们争着提出了自己的战斗立功计划。宣誓大会结束的时候，某连的政治指导员从布袋里拿出小心保存着的苹果，突击队员每人吃了一口，这些苹果是住在战线附近的一位朝鲜母亲送来的。朝鲜母亲的深情密意更加鼓舞了突击队员们的斗志。
    七月十三日傍晚，敌军阵地上的广播器里传来“打到鸭绿江去”的叫喊声，中国人民志愿军某部的突击队员们就在这时提着冲锋枪悄悄地走出了坑道。到九点钟，指挥员的命令从几十条电话线同时传到各个炮兵阵地，无数吨炮弹马上倾泻到金城西南的注字洞南山和杏亭西山一带的敌人阵地上。在炮弹的惊天动地的爆炸声里，李伪军首都师的阵地变成了一片火海。
    步兵进攻开始了，中国人民志愿军某部的突击队员们以压倒一切的勇敢精神制服了顽抗的敌人。在攻击注字洞南山的战斗中，曹家林用机关枪击倒了十多个敌人以后，自己的右手和机枪被敌人扔过来的手榴弹炸坏了，但他仍然用受伤的右手打出了两个手榴弹，又炸死了五个敌人，而后他又拿起敌人尸体上的冲锋枪猛扫敌人。爆破手李树和连续炸毁了七个在我军炮火下残存的地堡。当他爆破第八个地堡的时候，他的腹部和两腿都负伤了。他仍用尽力气爬近敌人的地堡，将一包炸药从枪眼塞进去，但却被敌人用枪托推出来了。李树和立即用冲锋枪朝地堡的枪眼猛扫了一阵，然后再将炸药塞了进去。
    一声巨响，这个地堡终于被炸毁了。英勇的李树和也在这时光荣牺牲了。突击队员们奋勇冲入李树和打开的缺口，顽抗的敌人被打得慌乱地向后逃窜。
    当我军占领注字洞南山的时候，攻击杏亭西山的我军部队也发出了占领阵地的讯号。
    这时另外一支突击队从注字洞南山的西边插到敌军背后，攻占了敌人退路上的制高点四二四点二高地。当自注字洞南山和杏亭西山溃败下来的敌人逃到这里的时候，我军用机关枪迎击了他们。接着，从正面攻击的我军部队也追了过来，前后夹击，将残敌压缩在不到一平方公里的山凹里。李伪军首都师第二十六团的二千六百多人到这里被全部歼灭。我军完全突破敌军从注字洞南山到杏亭五公里宽的防线，并向南推进了六公里。
