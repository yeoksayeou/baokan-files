    Moscow Stores Strive to Meet People's Needs (Part Two)
    Li He
    To truly understand Moscow's stores, one must visit the bustling Central Department Store and Gorky Street.

    The Central Department Store is located in the central district at the intersection of Petrovka Street, adjacent to the Bolshoi Theatre and the Maly Theatre. It has branches for cosmetics, hats, bicycles and motorcycles, furniture, and others located nearby. Before opening in the morning, a large crowd usually gathers around the Central Department Store, waiting to enter and join the ranks of shoppers. Once open, they disperse into the 115 departments across the store's four floors. Every day, tens of thousands of people from Moscow and across the country visit this largest of stores. Inside, activity begins long before opening time. First, the counters and floors are scrubbed clean. Then, the warehouse distributes goods based on requests from each department from the previous evening. After that, the sales staff take their positions. The fabric department is always the most crowded, mostly with women selecting light-colored silks and bright floral prints. The female shop assistants swiftly present various fabrics, patiently advising the customers. The custom-made clothing department is also very lively, with people ordering the latest styles. Any fabric sold in this large store can be used for custom orders. The clothing department subcontracts orders to dozens of the best tailors. In the shoe department, many people are trying on fashionable leather shoes, choosing from over a hundred styles of men's, women's, and children's shoes. About a train carload of shoes is sold here every day. In the photography equipment department, many are buying "Sharp" brand cameras with their telephoto and wide-angle lenses. The radio and phonograph department resounds with symphonies. The children's toy department displays automated train sets. The four telephones at the information desk ring constantly throughout the day. No fewer than 7,500 inquiries are made daily, either by phone or in person. Before opening, the information desk staff visit each department to check and record the goods available that day, allowing them to accurately answer customer questions. Now, from nine in the morning to nine in the evening, the Central Department Store bustles with crowds of people, because it provides the widest variety of daily necessities. This May, the Central Department Store supplied 22,000 kinds of goods, compared to 15,000 in 1948 and only 9,000 in 1945.

    From Red Square, heading northwest past the Hotel Moscow and Manezhnaya Square, you reach Moscow's most beautiful Gorky Street. Wide and orderly, Gorky Street runs straight northwest, through Soviet Square and Pushkin Square, extending to Belorussky Railway Station Square, and then connects to Leningrad Avenue. Along both sides of this street, about five or six li in length, stand one hundred and twenty multi-story buildings. The ground floors of most of these buildings house shops.

    At the entrance of Gorky Street is the "Moscow Store," which sells a variety of daily necessities. In its fabric department, many people are buying silk. Many women choose Chinese silk, admiring its wide width, fineness, and beauty. This year, many young women on the street are wearing blouses, shirts, and jackets made of Chinese silk. In the women's clothing department of this store, there is a full array of fashionable, patterned, and colored ready-made dresses, with two mannequins wearing dresses rotating automatically, allowing customers to see the dresses from all angles. In the men's clothing department, rayon and linen suits are on display. This store supplies complete sets of items for newborns – shirts, diapers, hats, blankets. Many husbands buy these items here as gifts for their wives in maternity hospitals.

    Across from the "Moscow Store" is a food store, divided into two sections. In the grocery department, people are buying hulled grains, macaroni, candies, biscuits, bagels, pies, coffee, and tea. In the food department, people are buying sausages, cheeses, butter, meat, eggs, wine, and brandy. Some are also buying Chinese peanuts (which are also sold at stalls on the street and bought by many). Soviet people are very interested in Chinese peanuts. They eat them raw and find them delicious. This store has an ordering service, delivering food to customers' homes.

    On Gorky Street, there are large food emporiums, grocery stores, candy stores, fruit stores, milk stores, fish stores, ice cream stores, and juice bars; there are three stores specializing in Armenian, Ukrainian, and Georgian wines, fruits, and other foods, and a store specializing in Tajik wines; there are Baku restaurants, Kiev restaurants, and many cafeterias, as well as food stores and cafeterias serving people with stomach ailments. On this street, there are large industrial goods emporiums, children's goods emporiums, clothing stores, fabric stores, shoe stores, cosmetic stores, fur stores, electrical appliance stores, photography equipment and radio equipment stores, kitchenware stores, as well as millineries, jewelry stores, and stores that sell used goods on consignment. On this street, there are the famous Children's Bookstore, the Dynamo sporting goods store, as well as bookstores, music stores, stationery stores, and flower shops. On this street, there are also some pharmacies, barbershops, tailors, and even watch repair shops. On this street also stand the famous Tchaikovsky Concert Hall, the historic theater named after the Russian actress Yermolova, the puppet theater led by Obraztsov, as well as the Central and Moscow cinemas, and the State Museum of the Soviet Revolution. Therefore, Gorky Street, with its sidewalks canopied by linden trees, is not only where Muscovites buy goods, but also where they stroll, relax, and enjoy themselves.

    Like other streets in Moscow, the shop windows on Gorky Street display what is sold inside. In the windows of fabric stores, mannequins are draped with light-colored silks. In the windows of fruit stores, lifelike fruit models are displayed. At night, the store lights are not glaring. The signs above the store entrances simply indicate the type of store and its number. Authenticity – this is the advertising characteristic of Soviet stores. Any exaggerated, dazzling, or even deceptive or salacious capitalist-style advertising is not seen here.

    Whether it is the Central Department Store, the stores on Gorky Street, or the stores in the various districts of Moscow, the trade network and trade volume are constantly growing. The trade volume of the city of Moscow last year increased by 24 percent compared to 1950. There are 235 stores in the Sherbakov District, of which 119 are food stores, and another eight stores will be added this year; all the stores in the district sold 754,867,000 rubles worth of goods in the first five months of this year; the trade volume of the district's department stores in June this year increased by 23 percent compared to the same month last year.

    Moscow not only serves its residents with a vast trade network and more and better goods, but the store staff in Moscow are also engaged in widespread socialist competition. There are 3,500 shop assistants in the city who provide excellent service to customers. Stores constantly study the needs of residents, and the Central Department Store and other large stores regularly hold customer representative meetings. (Xinhua News Agency)

    努力满足人民需要的莫斯科商店（下）
    李何
    为了具体地认识莫斯科商店，那么到最热闹的中央百货商店和高尔基大街去看看吧。
    中央百货商店在中心区彼得罗夫卡街口，与大剧院和小剧院为邻。它分出了化妆品店、帽店、自行车和摩托车店、家具店等在附近各处。上午开市前，中央百货商店周围通常就绕了一大圈人。他们是等候进入中央百货商店的购买者行列。开市后，他们便分散到中央百货商店四层楼一百十五个部里去了。每天好几万人从莫斯科本地和全国各地来访顾这个最大的商店。商店里面在开市以前许久就开始活动了。首先是擦洗柜台和地板，接着是仓库根据前一天晚上各部的申请分发货物，往后，店员们便进入工作岗位。到布匹部的顾客总是最多，绝大部分是妇女。她们挑选着浅色的丝绸和鲜艳的花布。女店员们敏捷地拿出各种布匹，耐心地给购买者作顾问。定做服装的部门也是最热闹的。人们定做着最新式样的服装。凡是这个大商店经售的任何布料都可以定做。服装部把定货交给几十家最好的成衣店去做。在鞋类部里，许多人在试穿时式皮鞋。他们从一百多种式样的男、女、儿童鞋子中随意选择。这里每天出售约一车厢的鞋。在照相器材部，不少人在买“敏锐”牌照相机和它的望远镜头、广角镜头。收音机部和留声机部传出交响曲。儿童玩具部摆着自动的火车列车。问询处的四部电话机整天不停地响着。每天打电话或直接向问询处打听的不下七千五百起。问询处工作人员在开市前就到各部调查和记下了当天备售的货物，所以能够准确地答复顾客的问题。现在，中央百货商店从上午九点到下午九点，川流着拥挤的人群，因为那里供给着最多样的日用必需品。今年五月，中央百货商店供应着二万二千种货物，而一九四八年只有一万五千种，一九四五年只有九千种。
    从红场往西北，经过莫斯科旅馆和“练马广场”，便到莫斯科最漂亮的高尔基大街。宽阔整齐的高尔基大街笔直向西北，通过苏维埃广场、普希金广场，伸展到白俄罗斯火车站广场，然后和列宁格勒大道衔接起来。在这条长约五、六华里的大街两旁，排列着一百二十座多层楼房。楼房的第一层绝大部分开设着商店。
    高尔基大街街口是“莫斯科商店”，经售着各色日用品。在它的布匹部里，很多人在买绸子。不少妇女选了中国绸子。她们爱中国绸子幅宽、细薄、漂亮。今年街上不少年青妇女穿着中国绸子做的洋衫、衬衣和罩衣。在这个商店的女子服装部里，排满各种时式、花样和颜色的现成洋衫，有两个穿好洋衫的假人儿自动旋转着，让顾客把洋衫前后左右看个仔细。在男子服装部，挂着人造丝和夏布的西装。这个商店供应着直到初生婴儿的成套用品——衬衫、尿片、帽子、毯子。不少当丈夫的人在这里买了这些用品送给在产科医院的妻子。
    “莫斯科商店”对过，是一个食品商店，它分作两部。在食品杂货部里，人们在购买去皮谷物、通心粉、糖果、饼干、面包圈、馅饼、咖啡、茶叶等。在食品百货部里，人们在购买香肠、干酪、奶油、肉、鸡蛋、葡萄酒、白兰地酒等。也有人在买中国花生（中国花生也在街上摊子上出售，很多人买）。苏联人对中国花生很感兴趣。他们拿着生的花生吃，觉得味道很好。这个商店里有订货处，代送食品到购买者家里。
    在高尔基大街上，有大的食品百货店、食品杂货店、糖果店、水果店、牛乳店、鱼店、冰淇淋店、果汁店；有专售亚美尼亚、乌克兰、格鲁吉亚的酒、水果和其他食品的三个店，有专售塔吉克酒的店；有巴库饭馆、基辅饭馆和许多食堂，也有为肠胃病人服务的食品店和食堂。在这条大街上，有大的工业品百货店、儿童用品百货店、服装店、布匹店、鞋店、化妆品店、皮货店、电气用具店、照相器材和无线电器材店、厨房用具店以至服饰店、珠宝店和委托经售旧货的商店。在这条大街上，有出名的儿童书屋、狄纳莫运动器材店以及书店、乐谱店、文具店、花店。在这条大街上，也有一些药房、理发店、成衣店，以至钟表修理店。在这条大街上还有着著名的柴可夫斯基音乐厅、以俄罗斯女演员叶尔莫洛娃命名的历史悠久的话剧院，由奥布拉兹卓夫领导的木偶戏院，以及中央和莫斯科电影院、国立苏联革命博物馆。所以高尔基大街和它两旁菩提树宛如华盖的行人道，不仅是莫斯科人购买物品的所在，也是他们散步、休息和娱乐的去处。
    高尔基大街和莫斯科其他街道一样，商店的橱窗都是经售什么就陈列什么。布匹店的橱窗里，假人儿身上披挂着浅色绸子。水果店的橱窗里摆着逼真的水果模型。夜间商店的灯光不刺人的眼睛。商店门口的招牌朴素地标明那一类商店的第几号店。真实——这是苏联商店的广告特点。任何夸张、眩目以至骗人或色情的资本主义式广告，在这里是看不见的。
    不论中央百货商店，不论高尔基大街上的商店或莫斯科各区的商店，贸易网和贸易额都在不断增长着。莫斯科市的贸易额去年比一九五零年增长了百分之二十四。谢尔巴科夫区内有二百三十五个商店，其中一百十九个是食品店，今年还要增设八个商店；全区所有商店在今年头五个月出售了七亿五千四百八十六万七千卢布货物；区百货商店今年六月的贸易额，比去年同月增加了百分之二十三。
    莫斯科不仅以广大的贸易网、以更多更好的货物为居民服务，在莫斯科商店工作人员还进行着广泛的社会主义竞赛。全市有三千五百个为顾客很好地服务的店员。商店经常研究居民的需要，中央百货商店和其他大商店不时举行顾客代表会议。（新华社）
