    President Pieck Issues Statement
    Advocating for All-German Conference for Peaceful Reunification
    German People Support Holding East-West German Representative Conference as Soon as Possible
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 22nd] TASS Berlin, July 21st dispatch: On July 20th, Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, issued a statement regarding the declaration of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic on July 15, 1953. The President's statement said:
    "The experience of the past eight years has shown our people that only through joint action by the people of East and West Germany can a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany be established, and the reactionary, fascist, and aggressive forces that are rising in Germany be suppressed.
    The enemies of peace and German unity dare to say that the German question can be resolved without consulting the German people and without an agreement between the people of East and West Germany. This is completely wrong. Establishing a truly peaceful government and a unified, democratic Germany is primarily a matter for the German people themselves. As a result of imperialist rule, our people have been dragged into two bloody and devastating world wars. These two wars were also the result of conspiracies by warmongers across the Atlantic, who hoped that the European people, especially the German people, would shed blood so that the major monopolies of America and Europe could amass huge profits. The fascist provocations of June 17th are a continuation of this imperialist policy, which aims to launch new wars and deepen the divide between the east and west of our homeland. But our people want peace. They will bridge this divide and end the division of Germany through an all-German agreement.
    The all-German conference between representatives of East and West Germany must decide on the practical measures necessary for holding free and unified elections throughout Germany, discuss the establishment of an all-German government, and take effective measures to ensure that a just peace treaty with Germany can be concluded as soon as possible and that the occupying forces in Germany can be withdrawn as soon as possible."
    The statement also pointed out that holding an all-German conference would also help the Four Powers reach an agreement on the German question. Therefore, negotiations must be held between Germans.
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd] TASS Moscow, July 20th dispatch: "Pravda" published a Berlin dispatch by P. Naumov, commenting on the West German reaction to the German Democratic Republic's declaration on July 15th proposing to hold an all-German conference as soon as possible.
    Naumov wrote: The people of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany warmly support the peaceful reunification of Germany on the basis of establishing a peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany. They believe that convening a conference of representatives from East and West Germany is a practical step towards achieving national unity.
    However, the Bonn clique opposes this. The Adenauer faction says that there is no question of negotiating with Grotewohl. The West German bourgeois newspapers have been ordered to use all means to make the initiative of the German Democratic Republic "forgotten." This is because the new proposal of the German Democratic Republic government has shattered the election conspiracy widely prepared by the Bonn senior ruling clique. Naumov pointed out: Recently, they have also talked a lot about "unifying Germany." The Adenauer group hypocritically caters to the German people's desire for the reunification of their motherland in an attempt to win the trust of voters.
    Naumov reminded everyone to pay attention to the direct connection between the Bonn group's election conspiracy and the recent decision of the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting on the issue of convening a Four Powers conference. He also pointed out that not only Bonn, but also the American aggressive bloc, is wearing a false mask of "caring about German unity" and carrying out insidious conspiracies in an attempt to save the fate of the Adenauer group in the upcoming elections, continue to maintain the division of Germany, and create conditions for accelerating the revival of the German Wehrmacht under the name of the "European Army."
    Naumov said: The German patriotic forces demand the restoration of German unity and warmly support the declaration of the German Democratic Republic government and the many measures it has recently implemented to end the division of Germany. The Bonn group's refusal to hold negotiations between representatives of East and West Germany once again proves that they were and still are the mortal enemies of German unity.

    皮克总统发表声明
    主张举行全德会议和平统一德国
    德国人民拥护尽快召开东西德代表会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：七月二十日，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克就德意志民主共和国部长会议一九五三年七月十五日的声明发表声明。总统的声明说：
    “过去八年的经验向我国人民说明，只有东德和西德的人民采取联合行动，才能成立一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国，并抑止正在德国抬头的反动的、法西斯主义的和侵略的势力。
    和平与德国统一的敌人居然敢说，无须通过德国人民、无须东西德人民之间的协议，就可以解决德国问题。这是完全不对的。建立一个真正和平的政权和统一、民主的德国，首先是德国人民自己的事情。帝国主义统治的结果，我国人民曾被卷入了两次血腥的、毁灭性的世界大战。那两次战争也是大西洋彼岸的战争制造者的阴谋的结果，这些战争制造者希望欧洲人民、首先是德国人民流血，使美洲和欧洲的大垄断资本能够敛聚巨额利润。六月十七日的法西斯挑衅，是这种帝国主义政策的继续，它的目的是想发动新的战争和加深我们祖国东西部之间的鸿沟。但是我们的人民要和平。他们将要通过全德协议的方式填平这道鸿沟，结束德国的分裂局面。
    东西德代表之间的全德会议必须决定为了在全德举行统一的自由选举所必需的实际措施，必须讨论成立一个全德政府的问题，必须采取有效措施，使公正的对德和约可以早日缔结，驻德占领军可以早日撤退。”
    声明并指出，举行全德会议也会对四大国在德国问题上取得协议有所帮助。所以，德国人之间必须举行谈判。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”刊载了普·瑙莫夫的一则柏林电讯，评论西德方面对德意志民主共和国部长会议七月十五日建议尽快举行全德会议声明的反应。
    瑙莫夫写道：德意志民主共和国和西德人民热烈拥护在建立一个爱好和平的、民主的、独立的德国的基础上和平统一德国。他们认为，召开东西德代表会议是走向实现全国统一的一个实际步骤。
    但是，波恩集团反对这样做。阿登纳分子说：根本谈不上与格罗提渥举行谈判。西德资产阶级报纸已经奉命用一切办法使德意志民主共和国的倡议“被人遗忘”。这是由于德意志民主共和国政府的新建议粉碎了波恩高级统治集团广泛地准备的选举阴谋。瑙莫夫指出：近来，他们也大谈其“统一德国”。阿登纳集团虚伪地迎合德国人要求祖国统一的愿望，企图以此赢得选民的信任。
    瑙莫夫提醒大家注意波恩集团的选举阴谋与最近美、英、法外长会议关于召开四大国会议问题的决定之间的直接关系。他并指出，不仅波恩，就是美国侵略集团也戴着“关怀德国统一”的假面具在进行奸险的阴谋，企图在不久后的选举中拯救阿登纳集团的命运，继续维持德国的分裂局面，并为在
    “欧洲军”的名义下加速复活德国国防军创造条件。
    瑙莫夫说：德国爱国力量要求恢复德国的统一，并热烈地拥护德意志民主共和国政府的声明和它最近为了终止德国的分裂局面而实行的许多措施。波恩集团拒绝东西德代表举行谈判，就再度证明了他们过去是，现在仍然是德国统一的死敌。
