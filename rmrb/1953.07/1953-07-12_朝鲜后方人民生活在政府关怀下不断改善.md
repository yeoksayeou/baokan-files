Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 11th: The wartime lives of the people in the rear areas of North Korea are constantly improving and being elevated under the regular care of the Republic's government.

    In this year's supply plan for workers, staff, and university students, the Republic's government stipulated that each person be supplied with 16 to 18 meters of fabric, three pairs of shoes, and 36 kilograms of aquatic food products. In addition, a large quantity of daily necessities such as soybean oil, soy sauce, paste, edible salt, soap, and socks are supplied. The supply plan for the first half of the year has been successfully completed before the end of June.

    Since the beginning of April, the amount of grain rations for public servants and their families has been increased. The government has also distributed blankets, leather shoes, and summer clothing materials to workers, staff, and university students at very low ration prices through consumer cooperatives in organs and factories and state-owned stores. In the first half of this year, various organs, factories, and schools, under the care of the Republic's government, have also successively carried out welfare work such as building bathhouses and laundries.

    【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜后方人民的战时生活，在共和国政府的经常关怀下，正不断改善和提高。
    共和国政府在今年对工人、职员和大学生的供给计划中规定：供给每人以织物十六到十八公尺，鞋子三双，水产食品三十六公斤。此外，还大量供给豆油、酱油、酱、食盐、肥皂、袜子等生活日用品。上半年供给计划已经在六月底以前顺利完成。
    从四月初起，公务人员和家属的粮食配给数量已经增加。政府并通过机关工厂的消费合作社和国营商店以很低的配给价格，先后将毛毯、皮鞋和夏季衣料配售给工人、职员和大学生。在今年上半年，各机关、工厂、学校在共和国政府关怀下，还陆续进行了修建浴室、洗衣房等福利工作。
