What is a Socio-Economic Formation?
Soviet Union F. P. Nodotekov and S. Zidarenenko

Comrade M. T. Kovalevko (Kiev), a reader of "Pravda," asks: What is a socio-economic formation?

Socio-economic formation is one of the basic concepts in Marxist-Leninist social science.

A socio-economic formation is a historically specific mode of production, which embodies the unity of productive forces and relations of production, as well as the political, legal, religious, artistic, philosophical viewpoints and social system adapted to these relations.

Therefore, the concept of socio-economic formation includes both social relations of production, that is, people's economic relations, and the entire spiritual life of society.

Before the advent of Marxism, all historians and social scientists generally applied the concept of "society," viewing it as something unchanging, something that once determined, would remain forever. They sought the key to studying society from various viewpoints, ideas, and theories, reducing the entire history of society to the actions of emperors, generals, and outstanding figures. Marxism pointed out the groundlessness of such subjective idealist views of society and for the first time created the only scientific, materialist view of history.

Historical materialism holds that society is an active organism, constantly developing and always possessing its own specific historical form. The development of society is a process of natural history, which is subject to objective economic laws that do not depend on people's will and consciousness. Adapting to these laws, one socio-economic formation replaces another.

Historically, there have been five socio-economic formations: primitive communal, slave, feudal, capitalist, and communist. The first stage of the communist socio-economic formation, namely socialism, has already been established in our country.

The mode of production of material necessities (food, clothing, shoes, housing, fuel, and production tools) necessary for the survival and development of society is the foundation of any socio-economic formation. The mode of production of material necessities determines the nature of the social system, the economic, political, and spiritual life of the people. The way of production is, so will the society itself be in its basics; so will the society’s ideas and theories, political views and political systems be.

The mode of production has two inseparable aspects: productive forces, which manifest people's relationship with nature, and relations of production, which manifest people's mutual relations in the process of producing material necessities. Belonging to the social productive forces are the tools of production, and the people who use the tools of production and realize the production of material necessities because they have certain production experience and labor skills.

Relations of production are people's economic relations, the foundation of which is based on a certain form of ownership of the means of production. The sum total of the relations of production that are adapted to a certain level of development of the productive forces forms the economic structure of society.

People's relations of production, that is, the economic base of society, are the fundamental things that determine all other social, political, and ideological relations.

Different social relations between people are formed depending on the form of ownership of the means of production that occupies a dominant position in a certain society. In exploitative societies based on private ownership of the means of production, antagonistic classes arise and develop, and the irreconcilable struggle between these classes encompasses all aspects of social life. Conversely, socio-economic formations based on public ownership of the means of production do not have social antagonism or class conflict.

The economic base generates its own superstructure: that is, society's viewpoints on politics, law, religion, art, and philosophy, as well as the political and legal systems suitable for these viewpoints. Marxist-Leninism teaches that the capitalist economic base has its own superstructure, and the socialist economic base also has its own superstructure. The class that dominates economically also dominates politically and spiritually.

The ideas and viewpoints of this class are the ruling ideas and ruling viewpoints in that society.

As mentioned above, the superstructure is organically included in the concept of socio-economic formation. V. I. Lenin pointed out: K. Marx "...while explaining the structure and development of this social formation exclusively in terms of relations of production, he nevertheless always investigated the superstructure corresponding to these relations of production, covering the skeleton with flesh and blood." ("What are the 'Friends of the People' and How Do They Attack the Social Democrats?", Selected Works of Lenin, Two-Volume Edition, Volume 1, page 99.)

Socio-economic formations are not forever unchanging. After any socio-economic formation arises under certain historical conditions, it develops due to the improvement of productive forces and gives way to another, more advanced socio-economic formation. The thinkers of reactionary and decadent classes always try to portray the exploitative system as eternal and unchanging. However, history refutes such views. In Europe, in three thousand years, after the primitive communal system, the slave system and the feudal system have been replaced; and in Eastern Europe, even the capitalist system has been replaced. In the Soviet Union, the socialist system has replaced the capitalist system. In various people's democratic countries in Europe, new socialist systems are also being established.

The development of new productive forces that conflict with the obsolete relations of production is the economic basis for the transition from one socio-economic formation to another. This transition occurs due to fierce class struggle, which reaches its most intense state in social revolution.

Marx called revolution the locomotive of history. It is precisely in the period of social revolution that the creative energy and initiative of the advanced classes, the broadest masses of the people, who are the true creators of history, are particularly powerfully expressed. Adapting to the mature requirements of social development, the revolutionary classes and their parties forcefully overthrow the old system, eliminate the obsolete economic base and superstructure, and create new social systems, thereby opening up broad spaces for the further development of social productive forces.

Modern capitalist society is the last antagonistic and exploitative socio-economic formation. The productive forces of this socio-economic formation have entered into an irreconcilable conflict with the bourgeois relations of production. The contradiction between the social nature of production and the form of private ownership is the basic contradiction of capitalism; it has reached extreme acuteness in the era of imperialism, especially during the general crisis of capitalism.

In order to seek a way out of the insurmountable contradictions of the capitalist system, the bourgeoisie has embarked on the road of unscrupulous exploitation and plunder of the working masses, and on the road of launching bloody aggressive wars and enslaving weak nations. All this is bound to cause the class and national contradictions in capitalist society to become more acute, and the economic and political turmoil to intensify.

The transition from capitalism to socialism is an objective inevitability of historical development, which is generated by the requirement that the relations of production must be suitable to the nature of the productive forces. Only socialism can liberate mankind from exploitation, crises, unemployment, poverty, and war.

The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union was the first powerful blow to the entire world capitalist system. This victory ushered in a new era in human history: the era of the demise of capitalism and the victory of communism. Because the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carried out economic and social transformation, a new, communist socio-economic formation has been established in our country.

The defining feature of this new socio-economic formation is the dominant position of public ownership of the means of production and the elimination of exploitative classes and the phenomenon of man exploiting man. The working class, peasants, and intellectuals who make up Soviet society live and work on the principles of fraternal cooperation. On the basis of the common interests of various social groups in the Soviet Union, the spiritual and political unity of society, the friendship of the Soviet nationalities, and Soviet patriotism have been launched as the driving force.

The new socialist superstructure is suitable for the socialist economic base, and it plays a huge role in the development of Soviet society.

Socialism has opened up boundless spaces for the development of productive forces and for genuine progress in all areas of life. In socialist society, the basic economic law of socialism is in effect, the main characteristic and requirement of this basic economic law is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of continuously increasing and improving socialist production on a highly technical basis. The purpose of socialist production is the person and his material and cultural needs. This is a lofty and noble goal that has never been found in any previous socio-economic formation.

The Communist Party is guiding Soviet society along the path of gradual transition from socialism to communism. In the era of communism, society will be able to realize the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

    什么是社会经济形态
    苏联  弗·普挪特科夫斯基  斯·季达列宁科
    “真理报”读者姆·特·柯凡列科同志（基辅）问：什么是社会经济形态？
    社会经济形态是马克思列宁主义社会科学中基本概念之一。
    社会经济形态是历史上一定的生产方式，这种生产方式本身体现着生产力和生产关系以及与这些关系相适应的政治、法律、宗教、艺术、哲学观点和社会制度的统一。
    因此，社会经济形态这一概念既包括社会生产关系，即人们的经济关系，也包括社会的全部精神生活。
    在马克思主义出现以前，所有的历史学者和社会学者都把“社会”这一概念一般地加以应用，视它为某种不变的，一经确定便永远如此的东西。他们从各种观点、思想和理论中去探求研究社会的关键，而把社会的全部历史归结为帝王将相和卓越人物的行动。马克思主义指出了这类对社会的主观唯心主义观点的毫无根据，并第一次创立了唯一的科学的唯物主义历史观。
    历史唯物主义认为社会是活动的、处在经常发展中的、和永远具有自己一定具体历史形式的有机体。社会的发展是自然历史的过程，这种过程是服从于客观的，不以人们的意志和意识为转移的经济法则。适应着这些法则，一种社会经济形态更替着另外一种社会经济形态。
    历史上有五种社会经济形态：原始公社制的，奴隶制的，封建制的，资本主义的，共产主义的。共产主义社会经济形态的第一阶段，即社会主义，已经在我国建立。
    为社会生存和发展所必需的物质资料（食品、衣服、靴鞋、住屋、燃料和生产工具）的生产方式，是任何一种社会经济形态的基础。物质资料的生产方式决定社会制度的性质，人们的经济、政治和精神生活。生产方式怎样，社会本身在基本上也就会怎样，社会的思想和理论、政治观点和政治制度也就会怎样。
    生产方式具有不可分割的两面：表现出人们对自然关系的生产力，和表现出人们在生产物质资料过程中的相互关系的生产关系。属于社会生产力的，是生产工具，和因有一定生产经验和劳动技能而运用生产工具并实现物质资料生产的人。
    生产关系是人们的经济关系，这种经济关系的基础建立在生产资料所有制的一定形式上。适应于生产力的一定发展的水平的那种生产关系的总和，形成了社会的经济结构。
    人们的生产关系，即社会的经济基础，是决定所有其他一切社会、政治和思想关系的基本东西。
    以在某个社会中占统治地位的生产资料所有制的形式为转移，形成了人们之间不同的社会关系。在以生产资料私有制为基础的剥削社会中，产生和发展着敌对阶级，这些阶级间的不可调和的斗争囊括了社会生活的各个方面。相反地，以生产资料公有制为基础的社会经济形态却没有社会敌对现象，没有阶级冲突。
    经济基础产生自己的上层建筑：即社会对于政治、法律、宗教、艺术、哲学的观点，以及适合于这些观点的政治法律等制度。马克思列宁主义教导说，资本主义的经济基础有它自己的上层建筑，社会主义的经济基础也有它自己的上层建筑。经济上统治着的阶级，在政治上和精神上也占统治地位。
    这个阶级的思想和观点是该社会中的统治思想和统治观点。
    如上所述，上层建筑是有机地包括在社会经济形态这一概念中的。乌·伊·列宁指出：卡·马克思“……虽专以生产关系来说明该社会形态底结构和发展，但他又随时随地考察相当于这些生产关系的上层建筑物，以肉和血把骨干包裹起来。”（“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主党人？”，列宁文选，两卷集第一卷，第九九页。）
    社会经济形态并不是永远不变的。任何社会经济形态在一定的历史条件中产生后，由于生产力的提高而获得发展，并让位给另一个更高级的社会经济形态。反动腐朽阶级的思想家总是企图把剥削制度说成是永恒的和不变的。然而，历史驳斥了这类观点。欧洲在三千年中，继原始公社制之后，已更换过奴隶制和封建制；而在东欧，甚至资本主义制度也已被更换。在苏联，社会主义制度已代替了资本主义制度。在欧洲各人民民主国家，新的社会主义制度亦正在建立。
    与陈旧了的生产关系发生冲突的新的生产力的发展，是一个社会经济形态过渡到另一个社会经济形态的经济基础。这种过渡之发生是由于残酷的阶级斗争，这种阶级斗争在社会革命中达到最紧张的状态。
    马克思把革命叫作历史的火车头。正是在社会革命的时期，作为历史的真正创造者的先进阶级、最广大的人民群众的创造精力和主动精神，特别有力地表现出来。革命阶级及其政党适应着社会发展中已成熟的要求，以强力推翻旧的制度，消灭陈旧的经济基础和上层建筑；创造新的社会制度，从而为社会生产力的进一步发展开辟了广阔的场所。
    现代资本主义社会是最后一个敌对的剥削的社会经济形态。这个社会经济形态的生产力已同资产阶级的生产关系发生了不可调和的冲突。生产的社会性与私人占有形式间的矛盾是资本主义的基本矛盾；它在帝国主义时代、特别是在资本主义总危机时期，已达到极端尖锐化。
    为了从资本主义体系不可克服的矛盾中寻求出路，资产阶级走上了肆无忌惮地剥削和掠夺劳动群众的道路，走上了发动血腥侵略战争和奴役弱小民族的道路。这一切必然会引起资本主义社会中阶级和民族矛盾的更趋尖锐化，经济和政治动荡的加剧。
    从资本主义到社会主义的过渡是历史发展的一个客观必然性，这个必然性是由生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个法则的要求所产生的。只有社会主义才能使人类摆脱剥削、危机、失业、贫困和战争。
    苏联的伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，是对于整个世界资本主义体系的第一个强大的打击，这个胜利揭开了人类历史上的新时代：资本主义灭亡和共产主义胜利的时代。由于苏维埃人民在共产党领导下实行了经济和社会的改造，在我们国家内已建立了新的、共产主义的社会经济形态。
    这一新社会经济形态的具有决定意义的特点，是生产资料公有制的占统治地位，剥削阶级和人剥削人的现象的消灭。组成苏维埃社会的工人阶级、农民和知识分子，在友爱合作的原则下生活和工作。在苏联各个社会集团的共同利益的基础上，发动了社会在精神和政治上的一致、苏联各民族的友谊和苏维埃爱国主义这样的动力。
    新的社会主义的上层建筑适合于社会主义的经济基础，它在苏维埃社会的发展中起着巨大的作用。
    社会主义为生产力的发展、为生活的各个领域中的真正进步，开辟了漫无涯际的广阔场所。在社会主义社会中，社会主义的基本经济法则在发生作用，这一基本经济法则的主要特点和要求就是要用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。社会主义生产的目的是人及其物质的和文化的需求。这是一个崇高的、高尚的目的，为以前任何社会经济形态所未有过。
    共产党正在指导着苏维埃社会沿着从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路发展。到了共产主义时代，社会就将能实现“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则。
