The thirty-second anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution falls on July 11th. In these thirty-two years, the Mongolian people have achieved great successes in the struggle for the independence, freedom, and happiness of their motherland. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in his congratulatory telegram to Marshal Choibalsan: "For several years, the Mongolian people, through diligent labor, have eliminated the legacy of the old era—centuries of backwardness—and have achieved great successes in improving the welfare and culture of their country."

Thirty-two years ago, Mongolia was one of the most backward countries in Asia. It had no industry or agriculture of its own, nor did it have its own trade; it was a country completely bound by the nets of foreign usury. The feudal forces of princes and lamas held absolute dominance. The laboring herdsmen were enslaved by a small number of princes and monastery owners, cruelly subjected to the double exploitation of domestic feudal lords and foreign capital, living in extreme poverty with very backward culture.

Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution and with the decisive assistance of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the glorious Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party headed by Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan, the Mongolian people finally overthrew the brutal rule of domestic and foreign oppressors and established a people's democratic republic. Land and pastures were nationalized, and livestock belonged to free laboring herdsmen. This created all possibilities for the free development of the Mongolian people's own country and domestic economic and cultural construction. As a result, in thirty-two years, the Mongolian people have made their country advance from a state of extreme poverty and backwardness towards the infinitely happy and infinitely beautiful road of socialism.

Due to the further consolidation of the people's democratic system, the Ninth Great People's Hural in 1949 announced the implementation of a completely democratic election system. The new election system guaranteed equal, direct, and universal suffrage through secret ballot. In the elections of the Great People's Hural held in 1951 in accordance with the new election system, 99.92 percent of all voters participated; 99.67 percent of the voters cast their ballots for the candidates nominated by the People's Revolutionary Party and the Non-Party People's Alliance. This is a clear demonstration of the Mongolian people's exceptional trust in the People's Revolutionary Party and the government, and of the high degree of political and ideological unity of the Mongolian people.

While the domestic people's democratic system was being consolidated and developed, the Mongolian people actively launched the work of national economic and cultural construction. After the 11th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in December 1947 adopted the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture (from 1948 to 1952), the economic and cultural construction of the Mongolian People's Republic entered a new stage of development. Thanks to the diligent labor of the Mongolian people, the correct leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people have achieved significant successes during the First Five-Year Plan.

The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has also instructed the Political Bureau of the Central Committee to formulate the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic for 1953-1957.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government vigorously develop animal husbandry, which is the main part of the national economy. Since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, up to 1951, the number of livestock had already increased two and a half times. All livestock now belongs to the laboring herdsmen. The average number of livestock owned by each Mongolian resident ranks first in the world. During the First Five-Year Plan, animal husbandry achieved significant development. The number of livestock in 1952 increased by 8.7 percent compared to 1947. The plan for 1953 will further develop animal husbandry, with livestock on state-owned farms increasing by 41 percent and livestock in herdsmen's production cooperatives increasing by 17.9 percent compared to 1952.

Agriculture is also developing rapidly. There are now many large state-owned farms using agricultural machinery such as tractors, combines, and automatic mowers. During the Five-Year Plan, the plan to increase the cultivated area of state-owned farms was completed by 151.1 percent, the grain harvest plan was completed by 112.5 percent, and the area of mowing fields was expanded by 105.5 percent.

State-owned industry is developing rapidly. There are now many large enterprises, such as the Choibalsan Joint Industrial Factory, the Stalin Meat Joint Factory, the Sukhe-Bator Power Joint Factory, the Nalaikha Coal Mine, and the Khatkhul Wool Washing Factory. Between 1940 and 1945, the total output value of Mongolia's state-owned industry increased by 280 percent. During the First Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output increased by an average of 9.8 percent per year. Calculated at the constant prices of 1943, the total industrial output value in 1952 increased by 151 percent compared to 1947. The national industrial production plan for 1953 stipulates that industrial production should increase by 10 percent compared to 1952.

The Mongolian people have also made great achievements in the development of culture and education in the past thirty-two years. Before the People's Revolution, there was only one non-religious school for the children of officials, and only one newspaper with a very small circulation. Only 0.7 percent of the residents were literate. But now Mongolia has 377 primary schools, 31 seven-year middle schools, 21 ten-year middle schools, 14 specialized schools, and 3 institutions of higher learning. More than 80,000 students are studying in these schools. The task of eliminating illiteracy was basically solved during the First Five-Year Plan, and 99 percent of the adult population is now literate. Mongolia now has 25 newspapers and 16 magazines.

The Mongolian people have also made great achievements in other cultural construction. During the First Five-Year Plan alone, the number of theaters increased by 150 percent, the number of cinemas increased by 125 percent, the number of mobile film projection teams increased by 100 percent, the number of clubs increased by 116.3 percent, and the number of libraries increased by 104.8 percent.

During the Five-Year Plan, the plan to expand the hospital network and clinic network was completed by 110.2 percent, the number of doctors increased threefold, large hospitals increased by 59 percent, small hospitals increased by 30.8 percent, nurseries increased by 25 percent, and maternity hospitals increased by 16 percent.

The achievements made by the Mongolian people in the past thirty-two years are inseparable from the constant, selfless, and fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union. The achievements of the Mongolian people are a brilliant example of the victory of the great Lenin-Stalin doctrine in backward countries. It inspires the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations.

The Chinese and Mongolian peoples have a long history of relations and a profound friendship. The Chinese people have always been deeply concerned and sincerely rejoiced at the tremendous achievements made by the Mongolian people in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the struggle for the freedom, happiness, and independence of their motherland since the founding of their country. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have also made the Mongolian people particularly happy and encouraged. Since then, the friendly relations between China and Mongolia, these two close neighbors, have developed rapidly. Especially last year, through the "Mongolia-China Friendship Week" sponsored by the Mongolian government, and through the conclusion of the Sino-Mongolian economic and cultural cooperation agreement, the cooperation and friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia have been further consolidated and developed. The revolutionary victories and construction achievements of the Chinese and Mongolian peoples have strengthened the common peace cause of the two peoples and strengthened the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union against imperialism. It is for this reason that the Chinese people warmly cheer the great achievements made by the Mongolian people in the past thirty-two years. (Xinhua News Agency)

    蒙古人民共和国的伟大成就
    戈更夫
    七月十一日是蒙古人民革命胜利的三十二周年。在这三十二年当中，蒙古人民在为自己祖国的独立和自由幸福的斗争中获得了巨大的成就。正如斯大林同志曾在给乔巴山元帅的贺电中所指出的：“若干年来，蒙古人民以勤勉的劳动，消灭旧时代的遗产——许多世纪来的落后状态，并在提高他们国家的福利和文化方面，获得了伟大的成就。”
    三十二年前的蒙古是亚洲最落后的国家之一。它没有自己的工业和农业，也没有自己的贸易，它是完全被外国高利贷奴役网束缚着的国家。王公和喇嘛的封建势力占着绝对的统治地位。劳动牧民被少数王公和寺院主奴役，残酷地遭受本国俗僧封建主和外国资本的双重剥削，过着极端贫困的生活，文化非常落后。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命的影响和苏联的决定性的帮助下，在以苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山为首的光荣的蒙古人民革命党的领导下，蒙古人民终于推翻了国内外压迫者的残暴统治，建立了人民民主共和国。土地和牧场收归国有，牲畜属于自由的劳动牧民。这样就给蒙古人民自己祖国的自由发展和国内经济文化建设创造了一切可能性。结果是，蒙古人民在三十二年当中，使自己的国家从极端贫困落后的境地，大踏步地向无限幸福、无限美好的社会主义道路迈进。
    由于人民民主制度的进一步巩固，一九四九年第九届大人民呼拉尔宣布实行完全民主的选举制度，新的选举制度保证以秘密投票方式进行平等的直接的普选。在依照新选举制度于一九五一年所举行的大人民呼拉尔的选举中，全体选民的百分之九十九点九二都参加了；投票选民的百分之九十九点六七都投了人民革命党和非党人民联盟所提候选人的票。这是蒙古人民对人民革命党和政府异常信任和蒙古人民在政治上和思想上高度团结的明证。
    和国内人民民主制度日益巩固和发展的同时，蒙古人民积极地展开了国民经济和文化建设工作。一九四七年十二月，蒙古人民革命党第十一届代表大会，通过了发展国民经济和文化的第一个五年计划（自一九四八年到一九五二年）以后，蒙古人民共和国的经济和文化建设更进入了新的发展阶段。由于蒙古人民的辛勤的劳动、蒙古人民革命党的正确领导和苏联的无私帮助，蒙古人民已在第一个五年计划期间获得了重大的成就。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会并已责成中央委员会政治局拟订一九五三——一九五七年发展蒙古人民共和国国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划。
    蒙古人民革命党和人民政府大力发展占国民经济主要部分的畜牧业。自从蒙古人民共和国建国以来，截至一九五一年止，牲畜的数目就已经增加了两倍半。所有牲畜已都归劳动牧民所有。每个蒙古居民所有的平均牲畜头数已占世界第一位。在第一个五年计划期间，畜牧业获得了显著的发展，一九五二年牲畜头数比一九四七年增加了百分之八点七。一九五三年的计划将使畜牧业得到更进一步的发展，其中国营牧场牲畜将比一九五二年增加百分之四十一，牧民生产合作社的牲畜将增加百分之十七点九。
    农业也正在迅速发展着，现在已有不少大的国营农场，使用着拖拉机、联合机、自动割草机等农业机器。在五年计划期间，在增加国营农场耕地面积方面完成了五年计划的百分之一百五十一点一，谷物收成计划完成了百分之一百一十二点五，割草场的面积扩大了百分之一百零五点五。
    国营工业发展得很快，现在已有不少的大企业，如乔巴山联合工业工厂、斯大林肉类联合工厂、苏赫—巴托尔动力联合工厂、那莱哈煤矿和哈特呼尔机器洗毛厂等。在一九四零年到一九四五年间，蒙古国营工业的生产总值增加了百分之二百八十。在第一个五年计划期间，工业生产总量平均每年增加百分之九点八。如以一九四三年的不变价格计算，那么一九五二年的工业生产总值比一九四七年增加了百分之一百五十一。一九五三年的国家工业生产计划规定工业生产量要比一九五二年增加百分之十。
    蒙古人民三十二年来在发展文化教育方面同样取得了巨大的成就。人民革命前，全国只有一所为官僚子弟设立的非宗教学校，只有一家销路很小的报纸，识字的人在居民中只占百分之零点七。但是现在蒙古已有小学三百七十七所，七年制中学三十一所，十年制中学二十一所，专科学校十四所，高等学校三所。八万名以上的学生在这些学校中学习。扫除文盲的任务，在第一个五年计划期间基本上解决了，国内百分之九十九的成年人都识字了。现在蒙古共有二十五种报纸和十六种杂志。
    蒙古人民在其他文化建设方面也取得很大的成绩。单单在第一个五年计划期间，剧院数目就增加了百分之一百五十，电影院增加了百分之一百二十五，流动电影放映队增加了百分之一百，俱乐部增加了百分之一百一十六点三，图书馆增加了百分之一百零四点八。
    在五年计划期间，扩大医院网和诊疗站网的计划完成了百分之一百一十点二，医生的数目增加了两倍，大医院增加了百分之五十九，小医院增加了百分之三十点八，托儿所增加了百分之二十五，产科医院增加了百分之十六。
    蒙古人民三十二年来所获得的成就，是和伟大苏联的经常不断的、大公无私的、兄弟般的援助分不开的。蒙古人民的成就，是伟大列宁—斯大林学说在落后国家中获得胜利的光辉榜样。它鼓舞着一切被压迫民族的解放斗争。
    中国人民和蒙古人民具有悠久的历史关系和深厚的友谊。中国人民对蒙古人民自从建国以来，为自己祖国的自由幸福和独立的斗争中在政治、经济和文化各方面所获得的巨大成就，无时不寄以深切的关怀和由衷的欣喜。中国人民革命胜利并建立了中华人民共和国，也使蒙古人民特别感到欢欣鼓舞。从这以来，中国和蒙古这两个亲密的邻邦的友善关系，更是突飞猛进。特别是在去年，通过蒙古政府主办的“蒙中友好旬”，通过中蒙经济及文化合作协定的缔结，中蒙两国人民的合作与友谊，得到了进一步的巩固和发展。中蒙两国人民的革命胜利和建设成就，加强了两国人民的共同和平事业，加强了以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的和平民主阵营。也就是为了这个原因，中国人民热烈地为蒙古人民三十二年来所取得的巨大成就欢呼。    （新华社）
