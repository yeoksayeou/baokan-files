The exhibition will allow the Soviet people to further understand how the labor-loving and peace-loving Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and their great leader Mao Zedong, and with the loyal, selfless, and fraternal assistance of the Soviet government and people, have achieved great victories in rapidly restoring and developing industry and agriculture over the past three years. He expressed his hope that the opening of the exhibition would greatly contribute to the mutual understanding, friendship, unity, and further strengthening of economic cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people.
