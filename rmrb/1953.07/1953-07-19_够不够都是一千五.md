Title: Whether it's enough or not, it's always 1,500

    The sales team is constantly complaining: Afraid of tigers when going up the mountain, and finding a host for meals is difficult;
    Reimburse travel expenses, 1,500, whether it's enough or not, it's still 1,500.
    This is a doggerel describing the life of salesmen at the Chenxian Store of the Hunan Provincial Department Store.
    Chenxian is surrounded by mountains, and there are tigers in the mountains, and transportation is inconvenient. Fifty to sixty percent of the sales tasks of the Chenxian Department Store are completed by the sales team taking goods to the countryside and selling them to rural merchants. Salesmen often carry goods on their backs and travel over mountains and ridges to find customers. Because the mountain roads are rugged and villages are sparse, it is difficult to find places to eat. They often carry a few hard cakes, walk for a day, and only find food when they stop to rest in the evening. When farmers have difficulty with food during the spring and summer famines, eating requires paying a high price. However, according to the regulations stipulated by the higher authorities, each person can only reimburse 1,500 yuan for travel expenses per day, and the reimbursement must be approved by the local government. Sometimes they are very tired from walking and are far away from the local government agencies, so they simply do not apply for reimbursement. Salesmen often calculate how much of the sales task has been completed and how much travel expenses have been spent. If the travel expenses are too high and the task is almost completed, they will stay down, save money and live frugally for a few days, accumulate some travel expenses, and then go to the countryside. But staying down for a few days will not complete the task, so they have to carry hard cakes and go to the countryside to make a blitz sale. Insufficient travel expenses affect the enthusiasm of salesmen and prevent them from exerting their potential. Although the salesmen repeatedly pointed out to the leadership that 1,500 yuan per day for travel expenses was not enough, the leaders never solved the problem for them. When the salesmen return from the countryside, the accountant urges them to report and pay the money. The salesmen feel that the work tasks are not light, but the store leaders do not take care of their lives.
    Obviously, the practice of the leaders of the Chenxian Department Store of simply using cadres without caring about their lives is wrong. They place a heavy burden on the salesmen, but rarely understand the actual difficulties in the work and life of the salesmen, and provide appropriate solutions within the possible range. This, of course, affects the work enthusiasm of the salesmen, and thus also affects the completion of sales tasks. Similar situations can still be seen at any time. For example, it often rains in Hunan, and the Provincial Department of Commerce agreed that the Changsha Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station should buy raincoats for salesmen, but the leaders of the supply station did not even give them an umbrella. The warehouse keepers move goods all day long, and their hands get very dirty, but the leaders do not even issue soap for washing hands.
    Leaders at all levels must correct the bureaucratic style of only using staff without caring about their hardships. Only by sincerely caring about the hardships of the staff can the leaders give play to their enthusiasm and better complete the work tasks.

### 够不够都是一千五

    够不够都是一千五
    沈文英
    推销组，直叫苦，上山怕老虎，吃饭难找主；
    报旅费，一千五，不管够不够，还是一千五。
    这是描绘湖南省百货公司郴县商店推销员的生活的一首打油诗。
    郴县周围多山，山上有虎，交通不便。郴县百货商店的推销任务，有百分之五十至六十是依靠推销组带货下乡推销给农村商贩来完成的。推销员常常背着货，翻山越岭去找顾主。因为山路崎岖，村庄稀少，很难找到吃饭的地方。他们常常揣了几块硬饼，走上一天，到傍晚歇脚时才搞饭吃，逢到春荒、夏荒农民食粮困难时，要吃饭就要付很高的代价。可是，按照上级规定的制度，每天每人只能报旅费一千五百元，并且要经当地政府批过才能报账。有时他们走得很累，离开当地政府机关又远，就索性不报销了。推销员常常算算推销任务完成了多少？旅费花了多少？如果旅费花多了，任务完成的差不多了，就住下来省吃俭用过几天，积下一点旅费再下乡。可是住下几天就完不成任务了，只得揣着硬饼再下乡突击推销。旅费不够用，影响了推销员的积极性，不能发挥他们的潜在力。虽然推销员一再向领导方面提出每天一千五百元旅费实在不够用，但领导干部一直没有给他们解决。推销员下乡回来，会计就催着报账交钱。推销员感到工作任务不轻，但商店领导干部却不照顾他们的生活。
    很显然，郴县百货商店领导干部这种单纯使用而不关心干部生活的作法是错误的。他们把推销员的任务压得很重，却很少深入了解推销员工作上生活上的实际困难，并在可能范围内给以适当解决。这当然影响了推销员的工作积极性，因而也影响了推销任务的完成。类似这样的情况还可随时看到。如湖南经常下雨，省商业厅同意长沙百货采购供应站给推销员买雨衣，但供应站领导干部却连一把伞也不给。仓库保管员整天搬运货物，两手搞得很脏，但领导干部连洗手的肥皂也不发给。
    各级领导干部必须纠正只使用工作人员而不关心其疾苦的官僚主义作风。领导干部只有真心诚意地关心工作人员的疾苦，才能发挥他们的积极性，才能更好地完成工作任务。
