Reader's Letter Summary:

    Pulaski County Baishun Township Election Working Group:
    Too Many Meetings Affect Farmers' Production
    Readers Ning Xiangqi, Shu Yi, Zhang Xuefu wrote: The pilot project of general election in Baishun Township, Fourth District, Pulaski County, Sichuan Province, was led by Comrade Bai Zhongshan, Deputy Section Chief of the Statistics Section of Pulaski Prefectural Commissioner's Office. He did not take into account the farmers' production and held meetings every day to busy himself with the election, which made cadres and the masses very dissatisfied. On June 2nd, Comrade Bai Zhongshan led the working group to Baishun Township. From June 6th to 15th, Comrade Bai Zhongshan held a total of 18 meetings of various sizes in Bao'an Village, such as village cadre meetings, activist meetings, militia meetings, women's committee meetings, women's group leader meetings, mutual aid group meetings, old people's meetings, resident group meetings, and villager meetings. Most of these meetings were unnecessary; many meetings lacked preparation, were lengthy and repetitive, and took a long time. On the evening of June 12th, Bao'an Village held a meeting of all cadres, and Comrade Bai Zhongshan arranged a series of 15 tasks at the meeting, including general election publicity, population survey, voter registration, rectification of mutual aid groups, formulation of short-term production plans, and launching competitions. Each task was discussed in detail, which made the cadres very tired. These tasks were not prioritized, and they were all arranged at once, leaving the cadres at a loss. Although production work was also arranged, production was not actually put in the first place. On the morning of the 13th, a women's committee meeting was held. Due to lack of preparation, the time spent waiting for people was longer than the meeting itself. At the meeting, Comrade Tang Shaohua, director of the township women's association, made a report on mobilizing women to participate in the general election, and other comrades made supplements. In this way, the issues to be explained were already clear. However, Comrade Bai Zhongshan made a lengthy speech, repeating what others had said. Many people couldn't listen and some fell asleep. The next day, Comrade Bai Zhongshan assigned cadres to hold women's group meetings separately to mobilize women to participate in the general election. In this way, everything was solved by holding meetings, one after another day and night, which seriously hindered production, and the masses were unwilling to participate in the meetings any more. On the 13th, Comrade Bai Zhongshan wanted to hold a meeting of the elderly to talk about the general election, but as a result, no one came to participate. The meeting was postponed again and again, and finally only a few people reluctantly came to participate. Comrade Bai Zhongshan often took coercive measures when gathering the masses for meetings. For example, sometimes the meeting was held until 12 o'clock at night, and the farmers were afraid of affecting the production the next day, so they withdrew midway. When Comrade Bai Zhongshan saw this, he shouted them back sternly and did not let them leave. The farmers were very dissatisfied with this situation. The working group cadres and village cadres had criticized Comrade Bai Zhongshan, but he not only did not accept it, but also forced the critics to examine their ideological motives. When summarizing the experience of the first stage of the general election pilot project in Baishun Township, Comrade Bai Zhongshan also regarded holding a series of meetings as a valuable experience and wanted to promote it to all villages in the township. We feel that this practice is very wrong and hope that the higher-level election committee will check and correct it.

### 涪陵县百胜乡普选工作组  开会太多影响农民生产

    涪陵县百胜乡普选工作组
    开会太多影响农民生产
    读者宁相琦、束义、张学富来信：四川省涪陵县第四区百胜乡的普选典型试办工作，是由涪陵专署统计科副科长白仲山同志领导进行的，他不照顾农民的生产，天天开会忙选举，使干部、群众都很不满意。六月二日，白仲山领导工作组到了百胜乡。从六月六日到十五日的十天内，白仲山同志在该乡保安村召开了大小会议共十八次，如：村干部会、积极分子会、民兵会、妇女委员会、妇女小组长会、互助组会、老人会、居民小组会、村民大会等。这些会议大部分是不必要开的；很多会议事先缺乏准备，内容冗长、重复，时间拖得很长。十二日晚上，保安村召开了全体干部会议，白仲山同志在会上一连串布置了普选宣传、人口调查、选民登记、整顿互助组、订短期生产计划、开展竞赛等十五项任务，对每项任务都讨论一遍，弄得干部们非常疲劳。这些任务不分轻重缓急，一齐布置下来，使干部不知从何着手；其中虽然也布置了生产工作，但实际上没有把生产放在首要地位。十三日上午，召开了妇女委员会，因为缺乏准备，等人的时间比开会的时间还长。会上，乡妇女会主任汤绍华同志作了动员妇女参加普选的报告，别的同志作了补充，这样，要说明的问题已经明白了。但白仲山同志却又作了长篇大论的发言，把别人说过的意思重复了一遍，许多人听不下去，有的就睡着了。第二天，白仲山同志又布置工作干部分别召开妇女小组会，动员妇女参加普选。这样，什么事情都用开会来解决，白天黑夜一个会接着一个会，严重地妨碍了生产，群众也都不愿意再参加会了。十三日，白仲山同志要召开老人会谈普选，结果大家都不来参加，会期一延再延，最后开会时也只有一部分人勉强来参加。白仲山同志在召集群众开会时还常采取强迫手段。如有时夜里开会到十二点钟，农民怕影响第二天生产就中途退席；白仲山同志看见了便声色俱厉地把他们喊回来，不让走。农民们对这种情况十分不满。工作组干部和村干部都曾向白仲山同志提出过批评，但是他不但不接受，还逼着批评者检查思想动机。在百胜乡总结第一阶段普选试办工作经验时，白仲山同志还把开一系列的会议当作宝贵的经验，要全乡各村加以推广。我们觉得这种作法是十分错误的，希望上级选举委员会加以检查纠正。
