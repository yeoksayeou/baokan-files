Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: The U.S. government continues to borrow heavily to cope with the financial straits caused by its frantic military spending. According to figures released by the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. federal government's national debt had risen to over $272.36 billion by mid-July, reaching an unprecedented peak for government borrowing in peacetime. This amount is more than $9.2 billion higher than at the end of July last year, and about $15 billion higher than when the Korean War first broke out.

Currently, the phenomenon of expenditure exceeding income in the United States is still very serious. In addition to the deficit of more than $9.38 billion in the last fiscal year, since the beginning of the 1954 fiscal year, from July 1st to the 22nd, in less than a month, expenditures have exceeded income by about $1.5 billion.

According to U.S. news agencies, because the amount of debt currently borrowed by the U.S. government is already close to the maximum limit of $275 billion stipulated by the U.S. Congress, the Eisenhower administration is preparing to ask Congress to raise this limit in order to further support the huge military expenditure by borrowing more money.

    美国政府疯狂的军事开支使国债惊人增加
    【新华社二十六日讯】华盛顿消息：美国政府继续大量举债，来应付因疯狂的军事开支而造成的财政拮据的局面。根据美国财政部公布的数字，美国联邦政府的国债到七月中已增至二千七百二十三亿六千多万美元，达到了和平年代政府借债空前未有的最高峰。这个数目比去年七月底增加了九十二亿多美元，而比朝鲜战争刚爆发时增加了约一百五十亿美元。
    目前，美国财政上入不敷出的现象仍十分严重。除了上一财政年度的九十三亿八千多万美元的赤字以外，一九五四财政年度开始以来，从七月一日到二十二日不到一个月期间，支出又超过收入约十五亿美元。
    据美国通讯社透露，由于美国政府目前借债的数目已经接近美国国会规定的二千七百五十亿美元的最高限额，因此艾森豪威尔政府已准备要求国会提高这个限额，以便进一步靠借债来支持庞大的军事性开支。
