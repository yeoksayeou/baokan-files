    Work Rhythmically to Improve Production Levels
    By Ma. Shmakarov, Director of the Kuibyshev Gas Appliance Factory, Leningrad
    The directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan are a fighting program for workers in all sectors of our national economy. In order to continuously increase and improve socialist production on a highly technical basis, it is required that every enterprise ensures continuous improvement in labor productivity, implements an extremely strict system of thrift, and increases the profitability of the enterprise.

    The directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan point out: "Economic workers should seek, discover, and utilize the internal potential of production, maximize the use of existing production capacity, continuously improve production methods, reduce production costs, and implement economic accounting."

    In the practical implementation of these tasks, organizing enterprises for rhythmic work, ensuring they produce products evenly each month, plays an extremely important role. This is a correct and reliable path to fully utilizing the advanced technology that equips socialist enterprises. A rhythmic production process can greatly improve product quality, drastically reduce the generation of waste products, and create conditions for high labor productivity for all personnel in the enterprise.

    The round-the-clock schedule chart, which includes all aspects of the production process, is the foundation for rhythmic work. Only a strictly enforced round-the-clock schedule chart can guarantee the balanced production of products, prevent disruption of production, and avoid shock work. For example, many factories in Leningrad now consider the round-the-clock schedule chart to be a production decree. Such enterprises include the Molotov Steel Rolling and Cable Factory, a machinery factory of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and many other factories.

    Our Kuibyshev Gas Appliance Factory is also producing according to a round-the-clock schedule chart. But this was not always the case. As late as 1949, the factory's production was often uneven and highly volatile. As a result, the task of improving labor productivity was often unfulfilled, and the capacity of the equipment was not fully utilized. In this situation, the issue of transforming the enterprise to production according to a round-the-clock schedule chart was very sharply presented to all the factory's staff.

    Under the initiative of the Party organization, all the factory's staff concentrated their efforts on solving this task. A wide range of workers, foremen, engineers, technicians, and staff were absorbed into participating in the formulation of various technical organizational measures related to turning the enterprise to production according to a round-the-clock schedule chart.

    At that time, we considered that our intention to implement rhythmic work would be futile and would fail if not only the activities of the main workshops but also the "rear" – auxiliary workshops, material supply departments, and other factory management departments – were precisely organized. Therefore, we paid great attention to the "rear" of production. In order to enable the iron foundry and die-casting workshops to work in a new way, nearly half a year of preparatory work was carried out. At that time, it was necessary to supplement the main workshops with tools, die-casting molds, and fixtures. Therefore, the production capacity of the tool workshop was increased. Not only that, but tool and equipment repair groups were also established in each workshop.

    The work of the factory supply department was also reorganized. The staff of this department worked more enthusiastically to maintain the proper level of material carry-over reserves and to receive materials from suppliers on a timely basis according to quotas.

    But this is only one aspect of the problem. In order to accurately comply with the schedule chart, the most important thing is to ensure that the workshop maximizes savings in the use of materials and ensures a high degree of perfection in technical operating procedures. The Party organization and economic workers paid special attention to this aspect. Now the factory staff has played an active role in saving materials and has saved a large amount of non-ferrous metals. Therefore, the factory is able to produce surplus products with the materials saved, that is, to overfulfill the plan. The activities of the comprehensive groups for creative cooperation have achieved great results. They have helped to eliminate many of the "weak links" in production.

    This is how we prepared for production according to a round-the-clock schedule chart. At the same time, socialist competition was also activated. When summarizing the competition, each workshop paid close attention to the extent to which each workshop, section, and group was working rhythmically.

    The work of converting to production according to a round-the-clock schedule chart was not only carried out from top to bottom from the factory administration, but it was first and foremost carried out from bottom to top from each section, absorbing many people to participate. In order to prepare production well, the plan was sent to the workshops, sections, and groups five to ten days before the start of the next month. In addition to the monthly plan, there was also a ten-day output schedule chart. This ten-day output schedule chart clearly stipulates the names and values ​​of the products for each day.

    From the first few days of implementing the factory-wide schedule chart, a system was established to regularly check the completion of the tasks of each section for one day and night. At the adjuster's meeting chaired by the production director, the completion of the schedule chart was monitored daily. Participants in the socialist competition paid close attention to the implementation of the schedule chart - timely signals from the sections can help to quickly turn the situation around.

    The work results of the day were quickly reflected in the specially established summary report form for recording the completion of the plan, and were publicized to all. The factory Party committee closely monitored the completion of the schedule chart and submitted every serious violation of the schedule chart to the Party organization for discussion.

    The balanced work of each workshop each month quickly affected the economic indicators of the factory. A decisive change took place in 1950. The ensuing 1951-1952 achieved even better results: the factory has exceeded the 1949 production level by more than double. The average output per worker has increased by almost 60 percent, and the output per unit of equipment has also increased by so much.

    Working according to the schedule chart enables the machinery and equipment to be operated evenly. For example, the die-casting workshop, whose equipment quantity is almost the same as before, has increased its casting output by nearly double.

    Rhythmic work has improved product quality. This is evidenced by the reduction in the return of the factory's finished products and claims for compensation. If, in 1949, the return of goods and claims for compensation we received accounted for 0.83 percent of the total output, then in 1952 it was only 0.05 percent. The finished products produced by seven workshops were all of excellent quality.

    The implementation of the round-the-clock schedule chart has had a positive impact on product costs - product costs have been greatly reduced. In 1950, product costs were reduced by 23.5 percent, in 1951 they were reduced by another 19.6 percent, and finally, last year they were reduced by 17.4 percent.

    The round-the-clock schedule chart has been firmly implemented in production. But it would be incorrect to think that the factory's staff can now easily obtain the fruits of their efforts. The work of implementing the schedule chart itself requires unremitting efforts, and there can be no complacency here. The matter of working according to the schedule chart places high demands on the leadership of the production process in all sections.

    In order to ensure rhythmic work, all production leaders must work creatively and proactively. Many things depend on the workshop director, deputy director, and foreman, on their ability to prevent all possible problems in a timely manner, and on their ability to quickly and correctly find solutions when the schedule chart is threatened with disruption. Unfortunately, not all leaders do this. Once, a message was received from the die-casting workshop saying that the phenomenon of stagnation was expanding and the amount of waste products was increasing. The inspection confirmed this fact. At that time, it was suggested that the workshop leaders formulate and implement the necessary various technical organizational measures. However, the workshop only implemented a part of the measures, which made it impossible to quickly and thoroughly overcome the backward phenomenon.

    Working according to the schedule chart does not allow for miscalculations and omissions. This is equally impermissible both in organizational matters and in technical operations. Not long ago, a workshop disrupted the pace of work. Why did this happen? It turned out that Comrade Guoli, the factory's production director, and Comrade Ivanov, the head of the workshop's production distribution office, disregarded the instructions of the technical supervision department and did not pay attention to supplying production with the necessary quantity of hard stainless steel in a timely manner.

    In other cases, the disruption of the schedule chart is caused by erroneous decisions on technical issues. Here is one of many examples. It is necessary to propose some changes to the design and technical operating process for manufacturing filters. The chief designer's office promptly produced the necessary drawings. However, the staff of the chief smelting technician's office treated this work in a formalistic manner. They changed the technical operating process without considering that the workshop did not have the appropriate equipment and the necessary tools had not been made. As a result, the production of finished products had to be temporarily suspended for a week, which naturally affected the rhythm of the workshop's work.

    However, in individual cases, the disruption of the pace of work is also due to circumstances that should not be attributed to the factory. Among them, the shortcomings in the equipment supply plan are the first. The current system of stipulating the next year's quota based on the material balance at the beginning of the fourth quarter does not assist the balanced work of the enterprise, especially in the first quarter. Under this system, the inevitable changes in material supply between October and December are not taken into account.

    Unfortunately, the Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry is not always able to meet our advance requests in a timely manner. For example, due to not receiving several tons of special steel (the factory requested these steels from July 1952), the diesel equipment workshop disrupted the schedule chart for a long time in January this year.

    The major tasks assigned to our factory by the Fifth Five-Year Plan charge all our staff to stubbornly seek new ways to improve and improve production. The work done in implementing the schedule chart is only the first step. This is the factory's evaluation of the achievements it has obtained. We need to continue to raise production technology to a higher level. There is still great potential in each workshop. For example, when analyzing the completion of the round-the-clock schedule chart, it can be found that the productivity of any work shift is usually greater in the second half of the shift than in the first half of the shift. This raises the issue of balanced labor in each work position during the work process of each shift, that is, it raises the task of changing to production according to an hourly schedule chart. Our factory intends to proceed in this direction.

    More efforts need to be made to further improve the level of production technology. Especially at present, it is necessary to promote new technical operating procedures for processing quenched steel with automatic machines and high-speed cutting on automatic lathes. At present, these work methods have not been widely adopted in the machine manufacturing industry. Efforts should be made to improve the structure of products, reduce the production processes for making these products, and designers and technicians, together with worker innovators, should find new ways to further reduce the amount of labor required for products. A great deal of work should be done in the mechanization of inspection and packaging processes.

    The new growth of socialist competition reflects the high political upsurge and labor upsurge in the factory's workshops, which is a patriotic response to J.V. Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress. The rich experience accumulated in working according to the schedule chart is a guarantee that all the factory's staff will be able to gloriously complete the major tasks assigned in the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan.

    有节奏地进行工作，提高生产水平
    列宁格勒古比雪夫气化器制造厂厂长　马·什马卡洛夫
    第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的各项指示，是我国国民经济各部门工作人员战斗的行动纲领。为了在高度技术的基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和改进，要求在每一企业中保证不断地提高劳动生产率、施行极严格的节约制度和增加企业的赢利。
    第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示指出：“经济工作人员应寻找、发掘和利用生产内部的潜力，最大限度地利用现有的生产能力，不断地改进生产方法，减低生产成本，实行经济核算制。”
    在实际执行这些任务时，组织各企业的有节奏的工作，使它们每月均衡地生产产品，起着极为重要的作用。这是充分地利用那装备社会主义企业的先进技术的正确而可靠的途径。有节奏的生产过程能够大大改进产品质量，急剧减少废品的产生，为企业全体人员高度的劳动生产率创造条件。
    包括生产过程一切环节的昼夜指示图表就是有节奏地进行工作的基础。正是被坚决执行了的昼夜指示图表才能保证均衡地生产产品，预防生产的不受破坏和不实行突击。例如，列宁格勒现在已有不少这样的工厂，对它们来说昼夜指示图表已成为生产法令。这类企业有：莫洛托夫钢材压延和钢索工厂，石油工业部的一个机械厂及其他许多工厂。
    我们古比雪夫气化器制造厂也在按昼夜指示图表进行生产。但并非向来就是这样的。还在一九四九年的时候，工厂的生产经常不均衡，波动性大。结果，提高劳动生产率的任务常常完不成，设备的能力没有被充分利用。在这种情况下，把企业转为按昼夜指示图表进行生产的问题，就非常尖锐地摆在全厂工作人员的面前。
    在党组织的倡议下，全厂工作人员都集中力量解决这一任务。广大的工人、工长、工程师、技师和职员都被吸收来参加制定为把企业转向按昼夜指示图表进行生产有关的各种技术组织措施。
    当时我们考虑到，不仅主要车间的活动而且“后方”——辅助车间、材料供给处和其他工厂管理部门的活动如果没有精确地组织起来，我们实行有节奏地进行工作的意图将会是徒劳无益的，会遭到失败的。因此，我们非常注意生产的“后方”。为了使铸铁车间和压力铸造车间按新方式进行工作，几乎进行了半年的准备工作。当时，需要有补充主要车间的工具、压榨模子和卡具。因此便增加了工具车间的生产能力。不仅如此，在各个车间还建立了工具、设备修理组。
    工厂供给处的工作也进行了改组。该处的工作人员更加热烈地努力保持材料跨期储备量应有的水平，及时地从供给者那里按基数领取材料。
    但这仅是问题的一方面。对准确地遵守指示图表说来，最重要的是要保证车间在使用材料上作最大限度的节约，保证技术操作规程的高度完善。党组织和经济工作人员特别注意了这一方面。现在工厂工作人员在节省材料方面发挥了积极性，节省了大量的有色金属。因此，工厂便有可能用节省下来的材料出产多余的产品，即超额完成计划。进行创造性合作的综合小组的活动获得了很大的效果。它们帮助消除了生产中许多的“薄弱环节”。
    我们就这样进行了按昼夜指示图表进行生产的准备工作。同时还活跃了社会主义竞赛。在总结竞赛时，各个车间都非常注意每一车间、工段、小组有节奏地工作进行到怎样的程度。
    转为按昼夜指示图表进行生产的工作，不仅是从上而下地从工厂行政上进行，它首先是从下而上地从各工段，吸收许多人来进行。为了很好地准备生产，在下月开始前的五天至十天之间，计划就送到了车间、工段和小组。除月份计划外，还有每旬产量指示图表。在这种每旬产量指示图表中明确规定每日产品的名目和价值。
    从实行全厂指示图表的头几天起，就规定了定期检查各工段完成一昼夜任务的情况的制度。在生产主任主持的调整员碰头会议上，每日监督指示图表的完成情况。社会主义竞赛的参加者非常注意执行指示图表的情形——来自工段的及时的信号，可以帮助迅速地扭转情况。
    当日的工作成绩很快就反映在记载计划完成情况的专设的总汇报表中，并予以公布周知。工厂党委会密切注意着指示图表的完成情况，对违反指示图表的每一严重情况都提交党组织来进行讨论。
    各车间每个月的均衡的工作很快地影响了工厂的经济指标。一九五○年发生了决定性的转变。接着而来的一九五一——一九五二年达到了更好的效果：工厂已超过一九四九年的生产水平一倍以上。平均每一工人的总产量几乎增加了百分之六十，每一设备单位的产量也增加了这么多。
    按指示图表进行工作能使机器设备均匀地开动。例如压力铸造车间，其设备数量几乎和以前一样，而铸造产量却提高了将近一倍。
    有节奏的工作使产品质量提高了。对工厂成品的退货和赔偿损失的要求的减少便证明了这一点。如果说，一九四九年我们所接到的退货和赔偿损失的要求占出品总产量的百分之零点八三，那么一九五二年只有百分之零点零五。七个车间所出的成品全都是优等质量的。
    实行昼夜指示图表对产品成本有了良好的影响——产品成本大大地降低了。一九五○年产品成本降低了百分之二十三点五，一九五一年又降低了百分之十九点六，最后，去年降低了百分之十七点四。
    昼夜指示图表已牢固地贯彻在生产中了。但认为现在工厂的工作人员能够不费力地获得努力的成果，这也是不正确的。实现指示图表这一工作本身要求不能松劲，这里不可能有任何泰然自安的余地。按指示图表进行工作这件事，对所有工段的生产过程的领导，提出了高度要求。
    为了保证有节奏的工作，一切生产领导者必须创造性地、主动地进行工作。许多事情都取决于车间主任、副主任和工长的，取决于他们善于及时地防止一切可能产生的毛病，当指示图表有受到破坏的威胁时，善于迅速而正确地找到解救的办法。可惜，还并非所有的领导者都是这样做的。有一次从压力铸造车间得到了这样的消息，说那里停歇现象在扩大，废品在增多。检查结果证实了这一事实。当时人们曾建议车间的领导者们拟定并实行必要的各种技术组织措施。可是这个车间却只实行了措施的一部分，这就使落后现象没有能被迅速而彻底的克服。
    按指示图表进行工作不容有计算错误和遗漏的现象。无论是在组织问题上或是在技术操作问题上这都是同样不容许的。不久前，有一个车间破坏了工作步调。为什么有这种情况呢？原来工厂生产主任果利同志和车间生产分配处处长伊万诺夫同志，不顾技术监督处的指示，没有及时地关心于供给生产以必要数量的硬质不锈钢。
    在其他场合下，指示图表的破坏是由于对技术问题的错误决定而发生的。这里就是许多例子中的一个。需要对制造滤过器的设计及其技术操作过程提出某些改变。总设计师处及时地做出了必要的草图。但总冶炼技师处的工作人员却以形式主义对待这一工作。他们没有考虑车间里没有适当的设备，必需的工具还没有做好，就改变了技术操作过程。结果，成品的生产不得不暂时停止一个星期，自然，这就影响了车间工作的节奏性。
    可是，在个别场合下，工作步调的破坏也有不应归咎于工厂的情形。其中首先是器材供给计划中的缺点。根据第四季度初的材料结存规定下一年的限额的现行制度，对企业的均衡工作没有起协助作用，特别是在第一季度。在这一制度之下，没有估计到在十——十二月间在材料供应上不可避免地要产生的变化。
    很可惜，汽车与拖拉机工业部并不是常常能及时地满足我们预先提出的请求。例如，由于没有得到若干吨的特种钢（工厂从一九五二年七月起就提出了对这些钢的请求），柴油器械车间于今年一月间长久地破坏了指示图表。
    第五个五年计划向本厂提出的重大任务，责成我们全体人员必须顽强地寻找提高和改进生产的新途径。在实施指示图表方面所做的工作——仅是第一步。这是工厂对已获得的成绩的评价。我们需要继续把生产技术提得更高一些。在各车间里还有巨大的潜力。例如，在分析昼夜指示图表的完成情况时，可以发现这种情况，即通常任何一个工作班在下半班的生产率总比上半班大些。这便提出了在每一班的工作过程中每一工作位置的均衡劳动的问题，即提出了改变为按小时计的指示图表进行工作的任务。我们厂打算向这一方向进行。
    为进一步提高生产技术水平，需要作更多的努力。特别是在目前需要推行用自动器加工淬钢的新技术操作规程和自动车床快速切削的时候。现在这些工作法在机器制造业中还没有被广泛采用。要全力改进产品的结构，减少制作这些产品的生产工序，设计师和技师同工人革新者一起要找出进一步降低产品所需劳动量的新方法。在检查和包装工序机械化方面应进行巨大的工作。
    社会主义竞赛的新增长反映了工厂各车间高度的政治高涨与劳动高涨，这是对约·维·斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和第十九次党代表大会各项决议的爱国主义的响应。按指示图表进行工作方面积累的丰富经验，乃是工厂全体工作人员能够光荣地完成在第五个斯大林五年计划中所负重大任务的保证。
