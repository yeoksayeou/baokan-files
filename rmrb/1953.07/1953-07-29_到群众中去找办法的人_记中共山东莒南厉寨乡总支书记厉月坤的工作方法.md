　　A Person Who Goes to the Masses to Find Solutions
　　——On the Working Methods of Li Yuekun, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Lizhai Township, Junan, Shandong
　　Jian Yun
　　In the spring of 1952, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Lizhai Township, Junan, Shandong, held several meetings in a row to discuss the formulation of a production plan, but despite the many meetings, a good plan was not formulated.
　　All the land in Lizhai Township is mountainous. The soil layer in these mountainous areas is generally only five or six finger-widths deep. Underneath the soil layer is either gravel or stone slag. The usual land yield is very low. Many farmers believed regarding the call for increased production from the Party and the government: "The soil quality is good in the plains. Deep plowing and careful cultivation can increase grain yield. But in these thin mountain lands, no matter how deep the plowing and how careful the cultivation, it is impossible to increase production." "In the past, the land was cultivated to a depth of four finger-widths, and now it has been cultivated to five or six finger-widths. In the past, the seedlings were hoed twice, and now they have been hoed six times. Deep plowing and more hoeing are useless." Increasing production was a major task placed before the Party General Branch. However, after several discussions, the General Branch Committee was still unable to come up with a solution. Some said: "How can farmers have good solutions? They rely on the above to provide solutions." Others said: "Relying on the above to provide solutions is not feasible. Even if they plan to hold a meeting only one day a month, what about the remaining twenty-nine days?" Although Li Yuekun, the Secretary of the General Branch, understood that it was impossible for everything to rely on the above to provide solutions, how to lead agricultural production was a problem that he had been unable to solve for a long time. At that time, he could only say to everyone: "Learn a little, do a little, and improve step by step!"
　　That summer, there was a drought, and the sorghum leaves curled up, and the millet could not sprout ears. The branch committee members were very anxious, and Li Yuekun ran back and forth in the fields because of this. He thought: "Mountain land is thin and cannot withstand drought, but what method can be used to make this mountain slab land drought-resistant?" One day, Li Yuekun discovered that the millet in Li Yongchi's field was growing green and leafy, and had already sprouted ears. Li Yuekun thought: "This land is so drought-resistant. If we can find the reason why this land is drought-resistant, we will definitely be able to solve the problem of drought resistance in mountain land."
　　Soon, a heavy rain fell, and the crops were no longer short of water, so they no longer paid attention to drought prevention. However, when the millet was flowering and drying, it rained every day, and the millet was soaked in water and turned yellow. Li Yuekun walked back and forth on the edge of the field again for flood prevention. He found that Li Yongchi's millet field was still growing very well. This land was both drought-resistant and flood-resistant. Li Yuekun thought: "Li Yongchi must have good experience in farming." He immediately turned back to Li Yongchi. When Li Yongchi said that the reason why the millet in this field grew well was only because it had been deeply plowed once, Li Yuekun thought, this was indeed a good way to increase the land's ability to resist drought and flood. The plowed land was to turn up the ripe soil and dig the stone slag four or five inches deep below the ripe soil, and then cover the ripe soil on top. In this way, when there is a lot of rain, it can seep into the yellow stone slag, and when it is dry, it can retain moisture, so that it can achieve the purpose of both drought resistance and flood prevention.
　　Li Yuekun introduced this experience to the branch, and everyone unanimously affirmed that this was a good experience. The General Branch Committee immediately decided to launch a land-plowing campaign throughout the township during the winter leisure period. In order to make ideological preparations for the land-plowing work in winter, the masses of the whole township were organized to visit Li Yongchi's millet field. The visiting masses watched and talked at the edge of the field. Some said:
　　"Today they call for increasing production, tomorrow they call for increasing production, but they haven't found the way to increase production. It won't help even if you shout yourself hoarse. But now it's good!" Some said: "This winter, we will give it a good plowing." Li Yueju's mutual aid team had 11.9 mu of peanut land that had been plowed, and they also planned to harvest and thresh separately to see how much peanuts could be increased. In autumn, these 11.9 mu of peanut land harvested 732 jin more peanut kernels, with an average increase of 61.5 jin per mu. The General Branch publicized the fact that this land-plowing increased production to the whole township.
　　In winter, a large-scale land-plowing movement began in the village. However, before long, Li Yueju's mutual aid team suddenly lost its enthusiasm and stopped after plowing three fen of land. Other mutual aid teams also stopped. "The benefits of plowing are so great, why is everyone not enthusiastic?" After Li Yuekun talked with several Party members and the masses, he found that there were still many specific problems in the mutual aid team that had not been resolved, which hindered the land-plowing work. For example: the work points calculation in the mutual aid team was still unreasonable; the contradiction between plowing and picking firewood had not been resolved; there was a lack of technical guidance. After these problems were raised to the General Branch Committee for research, it was determined that the mutual aid teams should be reorganized through land-plowing to improve the management methods of the mutual aid teams. They first tried plowing 2.5 mu of land in Li Yueju's team, and calculated that it took an average of 14 workdays to plow one mu of land. Based on this standard, they tried to implement the standard workday calculation method, overcoming the team members' concerns about using too many workdays for plowing and not being able to afford wages, which greatly increased the enthusiasm for plowing. The whole team originally planned to plow 15 mu of land, but as a result, all 39 mu of land that could be plowed were plowed. The branch introduced and promoted Li Yueju's team's trial experience to all the mutual aid teams in the township. Then, the branch went deep into the masses to summarize the local farmers' land-plowing techniques, and found out various soil preparation methods for different soil qualities in the process of plowing and research. For example, yellow mud sandy bottom land has half a foot of yellow soil on top, and yellow stone slag underneath. The plowing method for this type of land is to first hoe the half a foot of yellow soil to the side, then dig the yellow stone slag half a foot deep, and then put the ripe soil on top, and then deeply plow another five inches underneath. In this way, when there is a lot of rain, the moisture seeps into the yellow stone slag, which can retain moisture. The plowing method for sandy ridge stone soil is different. The four-finger ripe soil and five-finger gravel should be turned up and mixed together, and then the gravel underneath should be deeply dug one foot, and then the mixed raw and ripe soil should be placed on top. In this way, after weathering, the layer of soil on top will thicken and store moisture. Other plowing methods, such as half-soil half-sand land, sticky yellow soil head land, sandy beach land, and waterlogged land, were all studied with special soil preparation methods, and then organized visits and evaluations to promote the feasible experiences. In this way, the farmers in the whole township mastered the land-plowing techniques. In terms of labor allocation, 505 women and older children were mobilized to participate in picking firewood, so as to free up male labor to plow the land. In order to solve the difficulties of women with children, 38 mutual aid teams established temporary childcare groups.
　　That winter, the people of Lizhai Township were as busy and happy as when they were digging peanuts in autumn. Men, women, old and young, worked hard all winter. The whole township originally planned to plow 325 mu of land, but as a result, 817 mu of land were plowed, greatly exceeding the original plan. In addition, 760,000 jin of firewood were picked.
　　How did Comrade Li Yuekun and the comrades of the General Branch of Lizhai Township learn this mass line working method? After Comrade Li Yuekun studied in the county committee's Party member training class in 1951, he made up his mind: "We must learn to take the mass line and lead agricultural production well." As for how to take the mass line and how to lead agricultural production, he only heard some nouns and terms such as "mass line," "mass concept," and "from the masses, to the masses" in the report in the Party member training class, and he could not connect them with practical work. That winter, Sun Chengyun, the secretary of the district committee, came to Lizhai Township to lead the winter plowing work. Although the local farmers did not have the habit of winter plowing, the winter plowing task was successfully completed after Sun Chengyun carried out a series of persuasion and education work. Sun Chengyun's work was not to first hold a large meeting to make a long report, but to first hold a symposium with old farmers to ask everyone to study whether winter plowing was good or not. At the meeting, old farmers Li Yuehua and Li Yuerui introduced the benefits of winter plowing, and everyone said that winter plowing was good. In a few days, the masses of the whole township were mobilized. The original plan was to winter plow 500 mu, but 550 mu were completed. Li Yuekun observed this matter from beginning to end, and thought that his work was not done in this way, but adopted another working method. In the spring, when planting sorghum and millet, the higher authorities called for warm water soaking of seeds. The masses did not have the habit of soaking seeds, and they had not been taught the soaking technology. He did not understand these things and did not consider them, so he kept holding Party member meetings, Communist Youth League member meetings, mutual aid team leader meetings, and villager meetings, and handed down the tasks from the township to the village and from the village to the team level by level. After the meetings were over, few households in the whole township soaked seeds. Li Yuekun affirmed that the working method of the district committee secretary was the method of "from the masses, to the masses," but the understanding was not deep. After this land-plowing work, he deeply realized the content and significance of the working method of "from the masses, to the masses." He said at the General Branch Committee: "In the past, we were always troubled by the lack of solutions for production, and we hoped that the higher authorities would come up with good solutions. In fact, the masses have many solutions. Land-plowing is a good solution, but no one went to find it."
　　When the higher Party committee put forward the working method of grasping typical examples, setting good examples, and proceeding from points to areas, the General Branch Committee of Lizhai Township quickly accepted this working method. Everyone believed that setting an example was a good way. The land-plowing in Lizhai was first done by Li Yongchi and Li Yueju, and then everyone learned to do it. Because Li Yueju's mutual aid team was united and produced relatively well, the General Branch Committee decided to use this team as a typical team for the whole township, and various production tasks would first be done here and then promoted to other teams. Because the whole township was scattered over a distance of five li, and there were 80 mutual aid teams, it was still difficult to drive the whole township by relying on this team alone. Therefore, three more mutual aid teams were cultivated as base point teams. After adopting this working method, the coercive command style of cadres was further prevented, and the method of mobilizing farmers by educating them with facts was advocated.
　　In the autumn of 1952, the General Branch decided to have Li Yuekun participate in the leadership of Li Yueju's mutual aid team in order to strengthen the work of the typical team. In order to increase grain production even more, Li Yuekun first started a high-yield wheat field in this team. There was a sandy soil washout land in Nanheya Village, Lijiazhai. This land originally belonged to Li Yueshen, and he always complained that this land did not produce crops when he handed in public grain, and said that he wanted to return the land registration book (meaning he did not want this land). Later, Li Yueju exchanged it for another piece of land. This time, they used it to cultivate a high-yield field. At that time, some people reflected: "If this land can produce a high yield, then there will be no land in Lijiazhai that does not produce grain." Li Yuekun ignored these remarks. He first helped Li Yueju's mutual aid team to reorganize. Because there were still some problems in this team in terms of leadership style and carrying out criticism and self-criticism: such as Li Yueju's democratic style was not good enough, he was impatient, and he was subjective, etc. After the reorganization, Li Yueju's mutual aid team improved in all aspects. Team member Li Fuli used to be relatively lazy, and some people were impatient and advocated holding a meeting immediately to criticize him. However, Li Yueju decided to talk to Li Fuli individually first and educate him individually. Li Yueju and Li Fuli started by talking about how many mu of land a person should plant to harvest enough grain to eat, and gradually talked about Li Fuli himself: "You don't have more people than others, and you don't have less land than others. Why are you short of food every year?" Li Yueju helped Li Fuli find the reason calmly. Li Fuli was stunned for a long time and said, "Yes! Why am I short of grain every year?!" His face looked embarrassed. From beginning to end, Li Yueju did not directly criticize him with the word "lazy," but used the facts of how much fertilizer other families applied, how many times they hoed the seedlings, and how many times they weeded the land to enlighten and educate him. Then, Li Yueju helped Li Fuli build a manure pit next to his land, and also went to Beishan to cut some green grass and pressed half a pit of fertilizer. He also said to Li Fuli: "Don't just talk about difficulties, look at the land. The difficulties of farmers should be overcome by harvesting grain from the land." Later, Li Fuli became an active member of the mutual aid team who worked hard and earned a lot of points. The branch committee timely summarized the experience of the typical team in reorganizing and improving the mutual aid team, and the working method of Li Yueju's patient persuasion of Li Fuli, and spread it from point to area.
　　This high-yield field encountered many difficulties. When sowing, a heavy rain made it impossible for people to enter the field, and it was sown seven or eight days late. Less than two days after sowing, another rain came and it was stuffy, and the germination rate of the wheat was reduced. That winter, the wind and snow came early. Several inches of snow fell before the winter solstice. The wheat had not yet settled down and could not withstand such cold. Half of it was frozen to death. Around the Qingming Festival, it was hit by drought again. However, after replanting seedlings where there were missing seedlings, watering where there was a shortage of water, and catching insects where there were insects, the wheat was still dense when it sprouted ears, and even snakes could not get in. People who came and went on the road said: "There is no wheat better than this field within a radius of dozens of miles." The team members of the 80 mutual aid teams in the whole township all said: "Li Yueju has set a good example, and we have a goal to strive for!" This high-yield field achieved the purpose of high yield.
　　After the summer harvest, Sun Xueyan, the propaganda committee member of the district committee, summarized the work of this stage in Lizhai Township, and especially summarized the working method of Li Yuekun, the secretary of the General Branch. After Li Yuekun reported the above situation, when he talked about his experience, he said: The first important thing is to believe in the masses, believe that the masses have many good experiences and good working methods; only in this way will we ask the masses for advice and learn from them, and find the good solutions needed for production work.

    到群众中去找办法的人
    ——记中共山东莒南厉寨乡总支书记厉月坤的工作方法
    剑韵
    一九五二年春天，山东莒南中共厉寨乡总支委员会接连开了好几个会讨论制订生产计划的问题，会议开的虽多，但仍然没有订出个好计划来。
    厉寨乡的土地全部是山地；这些山岭地带的土层一般只有五、六指深，土层下面不是沙砾就是石渣子，通常土地的产量是很低的。党与政府提出的增产号召，许多农民认为：“平原地区土质好，深耕细作能多打粮食，这山岭薄地，再深耕细作也没法增产。”“从前耕地四指深，现在已耕五、六指深；以前大苗锄两遍，现在已锄到六遍，深耕多锄也不管用。”增加产量，这是摆在党总支面前的一大任务。可是，总支委员会讨论过几次，始终是拿不出个办法来。有的说：庄稼人那来个好办法，就是靠上面给办法；也有的说：靠上面给办法，那不行，就打算他一个月开一天会吧也只有一天，其余二十九天怎么办呢？总支书记厉月坤虽然懂得什么事情都要上面给办法是不可能的，但怎样领导农业生产呢？这正是自己好久解决不了的问题。当时他只得对大家说：“学点做点、步步提高吧！”
    这年夏天天旱，旱的高粱卷了叶子，谷子吐不出穗来。支部委员们很着急，厉月坤为这件事来回的在地里跑。他想：“山地土薄不耐旱，但是用什么办法可以使这山板子地耐旱呢？”有一天，厉月坤发现厉永池有一块地的谷子长的青枝绿叶，已吐穗子了；厉月坤想：这块地这样耐旱，要是找到这块地的耐旱原因，准能解决山地的抗旱问题了。
    不久下了场透汤雨，庄稼已不缺水，就不再注意防旱问题了。但是到谷子扬花晒米的时候，天天下雨，谷子被水浸的发了黄。厉月坤又为防涝的事在地头走来走去，他发现厉永池的谷子地仍旧长得很好。这块地既耐旱又防涝；厉月坤想：厉永池种地
    一定有好经验。他马上折回去找厉永池，当厉永池说出这块地谷子长得好的原因只是深翻过一次。厉月坤一想，这确是使土地增加抗旱和防涝能力的好办法。翻过的地，是将熟土翻起，将熟土下面的石渣子深刨四五寸深，然后将熟土盖在上面；这样雨水多的时候可以渗入黄石渣子，旱了又可以保持水分，就可以达到既抗旱又防涝的目的。
    厉月坤就把这个经验向支部作了介绍，大家也一致肯定了这是一个好经验。总支委员会当即决定在冬闲期间发动全乡翻地。为了给冬天的翻地工作做好思想准备，便组织了全乡群众下地参观了厉永池的谷子地。参观的群众在地头边看边谈，有的说：
    “今天叫增产，明天叫增产，没有摸上增产的门道，喉咙喊哑了也不治事；这下可好了！”有的说：“今年冬天要狠狠地翻他一番。”厉月举互助组有十一亩九分花生地都是翻过的，也准备单收单打，看看能够增产多少花生。秋天，这十一亩九分地的花生，多收了七百三十二斤花生米，平均每亩增产了六十一斤半。总支就把这一翻地增产的事实向全乡作了宣传。
    冬天，全村的大规模翻地运动开始了。但是，不久厉月举互助组的劲头突然不大了，翻了三分地就停了下来；其他互助组也有停了的。“翻地的好处这么大，为什么大家提不起劲来呢？”厉月坤和几个党员群众交谈后，发觉互助组中还有许多具体问题没有得到解决，因而阻碍了翻地工作。例如：互助组内的计工还不合理；翻地与拾柴的矛盾没解决；缺乏技术指导。这些问题提到总支委员会上研究后，确定通过翻地来整理互助组，改善互助组的经营管理方法。在厉月举组内首先试翻了二亩五分地，算出平均翻地一亩用工十四个。他们就根据这一标准试着实行了标准工的计工算账法，克服了组员怕翻地用工多找不起工资的思想顾虑，大大提高了翻地的积极性。全组原计划翻地十五亩，结果把全组三十九亩可翻的地全部翻了。支部就将厉月举组的试办经验向全乡各个互助组作了介绍和推广。接着支部又深入群众总结当地农民的翻地技术，在边翻边研究中找出各种不同土质的整地方法，如黄泥沙底地上面有半尺深的黄土，底下就是黄石渣子，这类地的翻法，先将半尺黄土锄到一边，然后再将黄石渣子刨半尺深，再将熟土放在顶上，底下再深翻五寸；这样雨水多的时候，水分渗入黄石渣子，可以保持水分。而沙岗石土的翻法就不一样，应先将四指熟土和五指沙砾翻起拌在一起，再将底下的沙砾深刨一尺，然后将拌过的生熟土放在顶上；这样经过风化后，上面的一层土壤增厚了，就可以蓄存水分。其他如半土半沙地、黏黄土头地、沙滩地、涝地的翻法都研究特殊的整地办法，然后组织参观评比，把可行的经验予以推广。就这样，使全乡农民掌握了翻地技术。在劳动力的调配方面，又发动了五百零五名妇女和年龄稍大的儿童参加了拾柴，以便抽出男劳动力来翻地。为了解决有小孩的妇女的困难，有三十八个互助组成立了临时托儿小组。
    这年冬天，厉寨乡的人，像秋天刨花生一样又忙又欢喜，男、女、老、少忙了一冬。全乡原计划翻地三百二十五亩，结果却翻了八百一十七亩，大大超过了原订的计划；并且还拾了七十六万斤柴草。
    厉月坤同志和厉寨乡总支部的同志们怎样学会这种群众路线的工作方法的呢？一九五一年厉月坤同志在县委会党员训练班学习后，就下了决心：“要学会走群众路线，把农业生产领导好。”至于如何走群众路线，如何领导农业生产，也只是在党员训练班听报告时听到的：“群众路线”、“群众观念”、
    “从群众中来到群众中去”一些名词术语，和实际工作就联系不起来。这年冬天，区委书记孙成运到厉寨乡来领导冬耕工作，虽然当地农民没有冬耕习惯，可是经过孙成运进行了一系列的说服教育工作后，是顺利地完成了冬耕任务。孙成运做工作，不是首先开大会做长报告，而是先召开老农座谈会，叫大家来研究冬耕好不好；会上老农厉月华、厉月瑞他们把冬耕的好处作了介绍，大家都说冬耕就是好。不几天全乡群众都发动起来了，原计划冬耕五百亩，结果完成了五百五十亩。厉月坤自头至尾观察了这件事，又想想自己的工作恰恰不是这样作的，而是采用了另一种工作方法；春天种高粱谷子的时候，上级号召进行温汤浸种，群众没有浸种的习惯，又没有传授过浸种技术，这些自己都不了解也不加以考虑，就一个劲地开党员会、团员会、互助组长会、村民大会，把任务从乡到村从村到组一级一级交下去，会开完了，全乡没有几户浸种的。厉月坤肯定了区委书记的工作方法就是
    “从群众中来到群众中去”的方法，但体会还不深刻。经过这次翻地工作后，就深刻地体会了“从群众中来到群众中去”的工作方法的内容和意义。他在总支委员会上说：“过去整天在闹生产上没办法，指望上级拿出好办法来，其实群众中有的是办法；翻地是个好办法，可是就是没人去找它。”
    当上级党委提出掌握典型、做好样子，由点到面的工作方法时，厉寨乡总支委员会很快接受了这个工作方法。大家认为做样子就是个好办法，厉寨的翻地就是厉永池、厉月举先做出了样子，然后大家学着干的。由于厉月举互助组团结、生产较好，总支委员会便决定以这个组为全乡的典型组，各种生产工作先在这里做出样子来再推广到其他组去。因全乡分散居住有五里路长，有八十个互助组，如果仅靠这个组来带动全乡还是有困难的，因此又培养了三个互助组作为基点组。采取这个工作方法后，进一步防止了干部的强迫命令作风，提倡了用事实来教育农民的动员方法。
    一九五二年秋季，总支决定厉月坤参加厉月举互助组的领导，以加强对典型组的工作。为了更多地增产粮食，厉月坤先在这个组内搞一块小麦丰产田。厉家寨村南河涯有块沙土冲地，这块地原来是厉月申的，他每年拿公粮时总要埋怨这块地不出庄稼，并表示要把地册子退掉（意思不要这块地）。后来厉月举用另一块地把它换了过来。这回他们就用它来搞丰产田。当时有些群众反映：“这块地要能丰产，那厉家寨就没有不收粮食的地了。”厉月坤没有理会这些议论，他首先帮助厉月举互助组作了一次整理。因为这个组在领导作风和开展批评与自我批评方面还存在着一些问题：如厉月举的民主作风还不够好，性子急，主观性强等等。经过整理后的厉月举互助组各方面都有了起色。组员厉福利过去比较懒散，就有些人性急，主张马上开会批评；但是，厉月举决定先同厉福利个别谈话，个别教育。厉月举和厉福利就从一个人种几亩地收多少粮食够吃谈起，渐渐谈到厉福利自己身上：“论人口你不多于人家，论地亩你不少于人家，为什么年年不够吃的。”厉月举心平气和地帮助厉福利找原因。厉福利呆了半天说：“是啊！就是年年缺粮?！”他的脸上显得难以为情。自始至终厉月举并没有正面批评他一个“懒”字，而是用别人家施多少肥，锄几遍苗，耪几遍地的事实对他进行启发教育。接着，厉月举帮助厉福利在自己的地边上整了个沤粪坑，还到北山上去割了些青草压了半坑肥，他还对厉福利说：“困难，不要光放在嘴上讲，要往地里看；庄稼人的困难，要指望地里打下粮食来克服。”以后，厉福利就变成互助组里劳动好、挣分多的积极分子。支委会及时总结了典型组整理、提高互助组的经验，和厉月举耐心说服厉福利的工作方法，由点到面地进行了传播。
    这块丰产地遇到的困难也真多，在播种时一场大雨，地里进不去人，晚种了七、八天；播种不到两天，又下了一场雨一闷，麦子的出芽率打了折扣。这年冬天，风雪来的早，冬至没到就下了几寸雪，麦子还没有盘棵，经不了这样的寒冷，一冻又冻死了一半，清明前后又遭到了天旱。可是经过缺苗补苗、缺水浇水、有虫捉虫，结果这块麦子在吐穗时仍然是密密的，蛇头都钻不进去；大路上来回赶集的人都说：方圆几十里，没有看到比这块地的麦子更好的。全乡八十个互助组的组员都说：“厉月举的样子做的好，咱向前奔有目标了！”这块丰产地达到了丰产的目的。
    夏收结束以后，区委宣传委员孙学彦在厉寨乡总结了这一阶段的工作，其中特别总结了总支书记厉月坤的工作方法。厉月坤在汇报了上述情况后，在他谈到自己的体会时，他说：头一件大事就是要相信群众，相信群众中有许多好的经验、好的工作办法；只有这样，咱们才会向群众请教学习，找出生产工作上所需要的好办法来。
