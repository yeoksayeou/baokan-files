Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Workers in various regions greet "July 1st" with achievements in competition.

    In Chongqing, workers in many state-owned factories and mines have completed their work plans for the first ten days of June during the labor emulation drive to welcome "July 1st," and have created many new records. Workers in Workshop No. 1 of Factory 101 found ways to shorten the repair time of the steel soaking furnace and the time to change rolling wheels, and steel rail production exceeded the plan for the first ten days of June by 30 percent. Workshops No. 2 and No. 6 of Factory 101, Workshop No. 4 of Factory 102, and Workshop No. 2 of Factory 104 also exceeded their targets for the main products in the first ten days of June. Li Yunhua's team in the raw material workshop of Sichuan Cement Plant created five new records in the first half of the month, and the maximum hourly output of raw material exceeded the plan by 32 percent. Wu Xian'en's steelmaking team in Workshop No. 2 of Factory 102 created new records for steel chemical specifications reaching 100 percent and external shape inspection reaching 98 percent. Now, the factories have begun to discuss production plans for the second half of the year. They all guarantee to further unleash production potential and formulate advanced production plans as a gift to the Party's birthday.

    Workers at the Hankou Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory launched a labor competition to welcome "July 1st." After the competition started, the mechanical workshop began supplying various parts two days ahead of schedule, overcoming the past phenomenon where delays in supply affected the completion of plans in the passenger car workshop. After the riveting, paneling, and dismantling teams in the passenger car workshop signed a contact agreement, their work efficiency also greatly improved. In the past, it took the riveting team 25 days to overhaul a passenger car, but now it can be completed in only 15 days.

    Li Zixin: Workers at the Datong Coal Mine have already achieved many successes in the labor competition to welcome "July 1st." The nationally renowned Ma Liuhai rapid tunneling team has been completing its plans evenly every day since June. Workers in the 847 recovery area have strengthened the connection between work types and strictly enforced various systems in the competition, and have fully completed their production tasks every day since May 8th. In launching the workers' competition, the Datong Coal Mine paid special attention to educating workers on labor discipline. As a result, the attendance rate of the entire mine reached more than 93 percent every day in June. The model electromechanical repair team of the Third Ventilation Shaft conscientiously implemented the chart operation and regular maintenance responsibility system, reducing electromechanical accidents in the first half of June by 61.62 percent compared to May. After the combined coal mining machine from the No. 6 Mine was moved to the 822 recovery area on June 8th, they quickly successfully tested the double-cycle coal mining method and created a record of 831 trucks of coal on the 14th.

    Since strengthening planning management in April, the state-owned Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has been completing its work plans on a ten-day basis. On this basis, all factory employees launched a labor competition to welcome "July 1st." The vehicle workshop completed the repair tasks of locomotives and rolling stock for the middle ten days of June on June 16th, and completed the repair tasks of freight cars for the middle ten days of June on June 17th, and also repaired four more freight cars.

    The workers building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway launched a red flag competition to welcome "July 1st." The workers in the rarefied air of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are finding ways to overcome various difficulties in their work and rush to repair the four difficult projects of Daheba, Shabotan, Daheihe, and Chalaping. Road-building workers at the Chalaping construction site also collectively created a working method for blasting wetlands, overcoming the construction difficulties in the wetland area that is still frozen at minus 15 degrees Celsius. Cheng Xinghe, a worker at the Shabotan construction site, created a tamping machine that can rotate freely in all directions. Zheng Fude, a mountain opening worker, designed a hand-cranked punching machine. These new creations have accelerated the road construction progress.

    The six cement plants under the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau completed their tasks for the first half of the year ahead of schedule.

    The No. 1, No. 3, No. 4, No. 6, No. 7, and Sichuan Cement Plants under the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department all completed and overfulfilled the production plans for the first half of 1953 ahead of schedule. Among them, the No. 1 Cement Plant completed its production task for the first half of the year 16 days ahead of schedule, the No. 3 Cement Plant completed its production task for the first half of the year 15 days ahead of schedule, the No. 4 Cement Plant completed its production task for the first half of the year 5 days ahead of schedule, the No. 6 Cement Plant completed its production task for the first half of the year 8 days ahead of schedule, and the No. 7 Cement Plant and Sichuan Cement Plant completed their production tasks for the first half of the year 6 days ahead of schedule.

    The main reason why these factories were able to complete their tasks ahead of schedule was that they fully mobilized the masses to find tricks and tap potential during the discussion of national plans, and put forward creative technical improvement opinions. As a result, accidents were greatly reduced, and the operating rate of machinery and technical and economic quotas were improved. For example, in May, the finished product workshop of the No. 6 Cement Plant eliminated accidental shutdowns, improved equipment utilization rate, and increased cement production by 276 tons. At the same time, it improved technical and economic quotas and increased cement production by 836 tons. The original planned shutdown time for the No. 3 Cement Plant in March was 21 hours, but the actual shutdown time was only 4 hours, and the operating time completed 106 percent of the plan. Due to the above reasons, the No. 1, No. 3, and No. 6 Cement Plants were able to complete their production plans evenly on a monthly basis.

    New Record for Coal Core Sampling

    In the past, the coal core sampling rate of the Fushun Mining Bureau Drilling Company was very low, and sometimes even no coal core could be obtained. After technician Zhang Yongbo participated in the National Drilling Conference, he realized the importance of drilling quality and was determined to improve the method of coal core sampling. After repeated tests, he finally successfully tested the "ball-type spring inner tube coal core tube" for coal core sampling on May 24.

    After the Second Drilling Team used this type of coal core tube, it drilled 1.5 meters on May 28 and sampled 1.48 meters of coal core. The coal core sampling rate reached more than 99 percent, creating an unprecedented new record for coal core sampling rate. (Fushun Mining Bureau)

    China's Largest Span Shanghu Stone Arch Bridge Successfully Completed

    China's largest span stone arch bridge - the Shanghu Stone Arch Bridge on the Shi (Shijiazhuang) Tai (Taiyuan) line has been successfully completed.

    The Shanghu Stone Arch Bridge was designed under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Gikhnov. In order to reduce costs and ensure durability, Comrade Gikhnov proposed using local materials to build a stone arch bridge. The bridge has three arches, the middle arch spanning 36 meters, and the arches on both sides spanning 10 meters each. Advanced methods such as hydraulic jacks to adjust stress, laying waterproof layers, and segmented simultaneous construction of the arch ring were used. This ensured the timely completion and excellent quality of the stone arch bridge.

    The workers building the Shanghu Stone Arch Bridge demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. When dismantling the arch frame used for building the arch, the arch frame weighed 300 tons. If it was dismantled little by little, it would take a long time, and if a flood came, the arch frame would be washed away and the stone arch would be damaged. They came up with a way to drag the entire arch frame out at once, and then dismantle it. As a result, the demolition time only took one and a half hours, which not only avoided the impact of the flood, but also saved manpower and material resources.

    After the Shanghu Stone Arch Bridge is completed, large locomotives on the Shi-Tai line will no longer need to move slowly when crossing the bridge. The engineering team is working hard to prepare for the opening to traffic and decided to officially open to traffic on "July 1st" as a gift to the birthday of the Communist Party of China.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    各地职工迎接“七一”竞赛有成绩
    重庆市各国营厂矿许多车间和小组的职工，在迎接“七一”的劳动竞赛中完成了六月上旬的作业计划，并创造了许多新纪录。一零一厂第一场工人找出缩短烘钢炉检修时间和换轧辊时间的窍门，钢轨产量超过了上旬作业计划百分之三十。一零一厂第二场、第六场、一零二厂第四场和一零四厂第二场，也都超额完成了六月上旬主要产品的作业计划。四川水泥厂生料车间李云华小组上半月内连续创造了五个新纪录，每小时生料的最高产量已超过计划百分之三十二。一零二厂第二场吴先恩炼钢小组，创造了钢的化学规格达到百分之百和外形检验达到百分之九十八的新纪录。现在各厂已先后开始讨论下半年的生产计划。他们都保证进一步发挥生产潜力，制订出先进的生产计划，作为党的生日的献礼。（据新华社讯）
    汉口江岸机车车辆修理工厂职工开展了迎接“七一”的劳动竞赛。竞赛展开后，机械车间已经提前两天开始供应各种配件，克服了过去由于供应不及时，影响客车车间完成计划的现象。客车车间的铆工、墙板、拆车各小组之间订立了联系合同后，工作效率也有了很大提高。过去铆工组大修一辆客车时需用二十五天，现在只用十五天就可以完成。

    大同煤矿职工迎接“七一”的劳动竞赛已有不少成绩。全国闻名的马六孩快速掘进组，六月份以来天天都均衡地完成了计划。八四七回采区的工人们，在竞赛中因为加强了工种联系，严格了各种制度，从五月八日开始到现在，每天都全面完成了生产任务。大同煤矿在发动职工竞赛中，特别注意了对职工劳动纪律的教育，因此，六月份全矿的出勤率每日都达到了百分之九十三以上。三风井模范机电检修组，认真执行了图表作业和定期检修责任制，使六月份上半月机电事故较五月份减少了百分之六十一点六二。六号井康拜因联合采煤机在六月八日，搬到八二二回采区后，他们很快就将双循环采煤法试验成功了，在十四日并创造了出煤八百三十一车的纪录。（李自新）
    国营戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂自四月份加强计划管理以来，已做到按旬完成作业计划。在这一基础上，全厂职工开展了迎接“七一”的劳动竞赛。车辆车间已于六月十六日完成了中旬机车车辆的修理任务，十七日完成了中旬货车车辆的修理任务，还多修理了四辆货车车辆。
    修筑青藏公路的工人们，开展了迎接“七一”的红旗竞赛。工人们在空气稀薄的青藏高原上，想办法克服工作中的各种困难，赶修大河坝、沙泊滩、大黑河、查拉坪四个艰巨工程。在查拉坪工地的筑路工人，还集体创造了爆破沮洳地的工作方法，克服了目前尚在零下十五度冻结的沮洳地带的施工困难。在沙泊滩工地的工人程兴和创造了可以前后左右运转自如的打夯机。开山工人郑福德设计了手摇式冲眼机。这些新的创造，都加速了筑路进度。（新华社）
    建筑材料工业管理局所属六个水泥厂提前完成上半年的任务
    中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局所属第一、三、四、六、七水泥厂及四川水泥厂均提前并超额完成了一九五三年上半年的生产计划。其中，第一水泥厂提前十六天完成了上半年的生产任务，第三水泥厂提前十五天完成上半年的生产任务，第四水泥厂提前五天完成上半年的生产任务，第六水泥厂提前八天完成上半年的生产任务，第七水泥厂及四川水泥厂提前六天完成上半年的生产任务。
    这些厂所以能够提前完成任务，主要是由于在讨论国家计划的工作中，充分发动群众找窍门、挖潜力，提出创造性的技术改进的意见。因而，大大地减少了事故，提高了机械的运转率与技术经济定额。如五月份第六水泥厂制成车间，消灭事故停车，提高设备运用率，增产水泥二百七十六吨，同时提高技术经济定额，增产水泥八百三十六吨。第三水泥厂三月份原定停车时间二十一小时，实际仅四小时，运转时间完成计划百分之一百零六。由于以上几种原因，使第一、第三、第六等水泥厂均能按月均衡地完成生产计划。

    采取煤芯的新纪录
    抚顺矿务局钻探公司，过去的煤芯采取率是很低的，有时甚至一点煤芯都取不上来。技术员张永波参加全国钻探会议以后，认识了钻探质量的重要，就下决心改进煤芯采取的办法，经过反复试验终于五月二十四日，用“滚珠式弹簧内管煤芯管”采取煤芯试验成功。
    第二钻探队使用这种煤芯管以后，在五月二十八日钻进一点五公尺，采取煤芯一点四八公尺，煤芯采取率达百分之九十九以上，创造了煤芯采取率空前新纪录。（抚顺矿务局）
    我国跨度最大的上湖石拱桥胜利竣工
    我国跨度最大的一座石拱桥——石（石家庄）太（太原）线上的上湖石拱桥已经胜利完工。
    上湖石拱桥是由苏联专家吉赫诺夫同志主持设计的。为了降低成本和坚固耐久，吉赫诺夫同志提议就地取材，做石拱桥。桥有三个孔，中间一孔跨度三十六公尺，两边的桥孔各为十公尺。并使用了油压千斤顶调整应力法、铺设防水层、拱圈分段同时砌筑等先进方法。这样，保证了石拱桥及时完成和优良的质量。
    修建上湖石拱桥的工人们，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。在拆除砌拱用的拱架时，因拱架有三百吨重，如果一点一点拆，时间很长，洪水一来拱架被冲，石拱就要损伤。他们想出办法把拱架一次整个拖出，再拆开。结果拆除时间仅用了一小时半，不但避免了洪水的冲击，还节省了人力和物力。
    上湖石拱桥完成后，石太线上的大型机车在过这座桥时就不用徐行了。工程队紧张地进行了通车工作，决定“七一”正式通车，作为对中国共产党的生日的献礼。
