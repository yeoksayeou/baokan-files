    In order to better serve production and construction through literary and artistic work, many regions have been planning to organize local theater troupes or cultural service teams to go to basic construction sites for touring performances and to provide guidance for workers' amateur cultural and recreational activities. Among them, the Northeast region started the work earlier and has achieved certain results and experience.
    From June to November this year, various theater troupes in the Central and North China regions will go to more than 50 basic construction sites in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Yangquan, Datong, Jingxing, Xingang, Baotou, Guanting Reservoir, Fengfeng Coal Mine, etc., to give touring performances to hundreds of thousands of workers, preparing to perform more than 400 shows. The theater troupes participating in this tour include the China Youth Art Theater, the China Peking Opera Troupe, the China Pingju Opera Troupe, the China Quyi Troupe, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the North China Drama Troupe, the China Youth Art Theater Affiliated China Children's Theater and Puppet Theater, the North China Henan Opera Troupe, the Beijing People's Art Theater, the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe, the Tianjin Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe, the Tianjin Pingju Opera Troupe, the Hebei Peking Opera Troupe, the Hebei Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe, the Shanxi Drama Troupe, and the Suiyuan Drama Troupe. These theater troupes are preparing to perform various short and pithy songs, dances, dramas, quyi, acrobatics and other programs that can inspire workers' production enthusiasm, or the excellent repertoire of each theater troupe, such as the dramas "The Dawn Shines on Moscow", "Forty Years of Wishes", Peking Opera "Yandang Mountain", "Black Whirlwind Li Kui" and so on. When performing at the construction site, they will undertake the guidance of workers' amateur cultural and recreational activities.
    According to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on "organizing the cultural and artistic forces of cities and strengthening cultural service activities at basic construction sites," and with reference to the experience of Harbin City last year in organizing social cultural and artistic forces to go deep into construction sites for publicity activities, combined with the specific conditions of various places, the cultural and art departments of various places in Northeast China have successively organized cultural service teams for basic construction to carry out cultural publicity activities at construction sites. At present, the cities in the Northeast region that have formed cultural service teams are: Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Lushun-Dalian five directly-administered cities; Harbin, Changchun, Siping, Jinzhou, Tonghua, Yingkou, Liaoyuan, Liaoyang, Andong, Mudanjiang, Qiqihar and other eleven provinces and cities and Haicheng County. These cultural service teams are organized by extensively mobilizing social cultural and artistic forces under the unified leadership of the local party committees and the active support of the government's cultural departments. Many places have established specialized leading institutions at the city level, and some have even established offices to be responsible for leading the daily work of the cultural service teams. Many of these cultural service teams have implemented the policy of "delivering to the door" and "reclaiming wasteland on the spot", and have appropriately solved the combination of service and guidance work. That is, after the service work is carried out normally, they concentrate their efforts on grasping the guidance work and cultivating activists at the construction site to become the backbone for carrying out workers' cultural and recreational activities. Their activities have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of basic construction workers; the personnel participating in the work have also received great education through service activities. The Culture and Education Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions also held a conference on publicity work at basic construction sites in Shenyang City in early June to understand the current situation of publicity work at basic construction sites, and to study the problems in organizing cultural service teams for basic construction, and to exchange work experience, in order to further strengthen publicity work at construction sites.
    Other provinces and cities, such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an, also attach great importance to this work.

    中央和华北、东北等地区组织当地剧团或文化服务队到基本建设工地巡回演出和进行辅导工作
    为了使文艺工作更好地为生产建设服务，很多地区已经有计划地组织当地的剧团，或组织文化服务队，出发到基本建设工地作巡回演出和进行工人业余文娱活动的辅导工作。其中东北地区的工作开始得较早，并已获得一定的成绩和经验。
    中央和华北区的各个剧团从今年六月起至十一月，将分别前往北京、天津、唐山、秦皇岛、石家庄、太原、阳泉、大同、井陉、新港、包头、官厅水库、峰峰煤矿等五十多处基本建设工地，对数十万工人作巡回演出，准备演四百多场。参加这次巡回演出的剧团有中国青年艺术剧院、中国京剧团、中国评剧团、中国曲艺团、中国杂技团、华北话剧团、中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团和木偶剧团、华北豫剧团、北京人民艺术剧院、天津歌舞团、天津河北梆子剧团、天津评剧团、河北省京剧团、河北省河北梆子剧团、山西话剧团、绥远省话剧团等。这些剧团准备演出的，包括各种短小精悍、能够鼓舞工人生产情绪的歌舞、戏剧、曲艺、杂技等节目，或是各剧团优良的保留节目，如话剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”、“四十年的愿望”、京剧“雁荡山”、“黑旋风李逵”等。他们在工地演出时，将负担工人业余文娱活动的辅导工作。
    东北各地文化艺术部门，根据中共中央东北局“组织城市的文化艺术力量，加强基本建设工地的文化服务活动”的指示，并参照去年哈尔滨市组织社会文化艺术力量深入工地进行宣传活动的经验，结合各地具体情况，已先后组织了基本建设文化服务队，到工地开展文化宣传活动。目前东北区已组成文化服务队的有：沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、旅大五直属市；哈尔滨、长春、四平、锦州、通化、营口、辽源、辽阳、安东、牡丹江、齐齐哈尔等十一个省市和海城县。这些文化服务队是在当地党委的统一领导和政府文化主管部门的积极支持下，比较广泛地发动了社会文化艺术力量组织成的。不少地方都建立了全市的专门领导机构，有的并建立了办公室，负责领导文化服务队的日常工作。其中很多文化服务队，贯彻了“送上门去”和“就地开荒”的方针，较为适当地解决了服务与辅导工作的结合问题。即服务工作正常开展以后，就集中精力抓紧进行辅导工作，培养工地的积极分子成为开展工人文娱活动的骨干。他们的活动大大鼓舞了基本建设工人的积极性；参加工作的人员，通过服务活动也受到了很大的教育。东北总工会文教部并于六月初在沈阳市召开了基本建设工地宣传工作会议，了解目前基本建设工地宣传工作的情况，并研究了组织基本建设文化服务队工作中的问题，和交流工作经验，来进一步加强工地的宣传工作。
    其他如江西、湖南、武汉、重庆、西安等省、市，也都非常重视这一工作。
