    Dezhou Prefecture Cooperatives Simplify Wheat Purchase Procedures to Care for Farmers Selling Grain
    A letter from Liu Hao of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province: In this year's wheat purchase work, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Dezhou Prefecture, in addition to conducting in-depth and extensive publicity and education among farmers and correctly grasping price policies, have also paid special attention to strengthening services for the masses selling grain. This has played a significant role in smoothly carrying out the purchase work, further strengthening ties with farmers, and enhancing the prestige of cooperatives among the people.
    The vast majority of the 239 fixed purchase points in the entire prefecture have built cool sheds with reed mats and straw mats, and prepared boiled water so that the masses selling grain will not be thirsty or exposed to the sun after arriving at the purchase points in the hot summer. In order to adapt to the characteristics of rural areas and the habits of farmers, many purchase points do not mechanically implement work schedules. For example, the De County Chengguan Cooperative starts purchasing in the morning and postpones study time to the afternoon or evening, because many farmers are willing to sell grain in the morning (it is cool in the morning, and getting up early does not delay production). At the same time, many purchase points have automatically increased working hours to ensure that farmers can sell their grain as soon as they arrive. The staff at the purchase points can treat the masses selling grain with a kind attitude and warm hospitality. Many staff members (such as those at the purchase points in Renfeng District, En County, and Jiyang County) take special care of the elderly, weak, women, and families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers who come to the cooperative to sell grain, and take their wheat from a distance and carry it to the cooperative on their behalf. In addition, some purchase points have paid attention to simplifying procedures as much as possible and constantly researching and improving purchase methods to save farmers' time. In the past, the masses waiting for inspection and weighing lined up in order and could not move around casually (for fear that others would take their place). Now, many purchase points in Jiyang and other counties have adopted the method of numbering with paper cards and weighing according to the numbers, so farmers can move freely after receiving the paper cards. At the same time, the procedures from inspection to payment have also been greatly simplified, thereby overcoming congestion and the phenomenon of the masses waiting for too long. In the past, farmers selling grain had to wait for almost four or five hours to finish after arriving at the purchase point, but now they wait for at most one or two hours, and some only wait for twenty or thirty minutes.
    Because the cooperatives correctly grasp the policy of "pricing according to quality" and "better price for better wheat," the weighing is fair when purchasing wheat, and coupled with the above-mentioned work of serving farmers selling grain, the masses are very happy to sell wheat to the state. Many farmers reflected: In the past, when they went to the cooperative to sell grain, they could not even drink cold water; this year, the cooperative built cool sheds and boiled water, and the management style has really improved. Some farmers also reflected: "There are four benefits to selling wheat to the cooperative this year: reasonable prices, fair weighing, simple procedures, and warm hospitality. Who would not want to come to the cooperative to sell wheat like this!" I think this approach is very good and should be promoted.

### 德州专区合作社收购小麦时简化收购手续照顾售麦农民

专栏：读者来信摘要

    德州专区合作社收购小麦时简化收购手续照顾售麦农民
    山东省德州专署财经委员会刘浩来信：德州专区各基层供销合作社在今年收购小麦工作中，除深入、广泛地向农民进行宣传教育和正确掌握价格政策外，还特别注意加强为售麦群众服务的工作。这对顺利开展收购工作，进一步密切与农民的联系，提高合作社在人民群众中的威信都起了重大作用。
    全专区二百三十九个固定收购点，绝大部分都用苇箔、席子等搭了凉棚，并准备了开水，使售麦群众在炎热的夏天赶到收购点以后渴不着，晒不着。许多收购点为适应农村特点和农民习惯，都不机械地执行作息时间。如德县城关合作社从早晨起开始收购，把学习时间推迟到下午或晚上，因为许多农民愿意在早晨的时间去售麦（早晨凉爽，而且起早可以不耽误生产）。同时，许多收购点都自动增加了工作时间，保证农民随送随收。收购点的工作人员对售麦群众都能做到态度和蔼，热情招待。有不少的工作人员（如恩县、济阳县仁风区等地收购点）对到合作社售粮的老弱妇孺以及烈、军、工属特别照顾，在很远的地方就把他们的小麦接过来代为背到合作社。此外，有些收购点还注意了尽量简化手续，不断研究改善收购方法，以节省农民的时间。过去，等待验级、过秤的群众，顺序排队，不能随便走动（恐怕一走别人就占去了自己的地位）。现在济阳等县许多收购点采用了纸牌编号、按号过磅的办法，农民拿了纸牌以后可以自由活动；同时从检验等级到付款的手续也大大简化了，从而克服了拥挤和使群众等待过久的现象。过去售麦农民到收购点后差不多要等上四、五小时才能完事，现在最多等一两个小时，有的等二、三十分钟就行了。
    因为合作社正确地掌握“以质论价”、“优麦优价”的政策，收麦时秤头公道，再加上做好了上述种种为售麦农民服务的工作，使群众都十分高兴地向国家出售小麦。许多农民反映：过去到合作社卖粮食，连凉水都喝不上；今年合作社又搭凉棚又烧开水，经营作风真是改进了。也有的农民反映：“今年到合作社卖麦子有四个好处：价格合理，秤头公道，手续简便，招待殷勤。这样谁还不愿到合作社来卖麦子！”我觉得这样做法很好，应该推广。
