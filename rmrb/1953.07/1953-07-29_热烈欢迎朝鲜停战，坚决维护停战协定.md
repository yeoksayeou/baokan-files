    Warmly Welcome the Korean Armistice, Resolutely Safeguard the Armistice Agreement
    Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    On July 27, 1953, the chief representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation and the chief representative of the United Nations Command delegation officially signed the Korean Armistice Agreement in Panmunjom, ending the Korean War, which had lasted for three years and thirty-three days, and realizing the peaceful aspirations of hundreds of millions of people around the world. All peace-loving people around the world are encouraged by the realization of the Korean armistice and cheer for another major victory in the cause of peace. Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, has contributed its great strength in this great struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, and therefore we feel incomparably honored and gratified.

    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement marks the victory of the brilliant policy of peace and the failure of the war policy of American imperialism. When the enemy launched the Korean War, the Soviet government immediately proposed a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The governments and people of Korea and China also repeatedly expressed the same desire and subsequently made unremitting efforts to realize this peaceful aspiration. However, the United States disregarded the peaceful aspirations of the good people of the world, disregarded the consistent proposition of the Soviet Union and the governments and people of Korea and China for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and was determined to occupy all of Korea and extend the flames of war to the northeastern border of China. Only when the warmongers suffered serious military blows from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, were forced back to the place where they started the war, and were unable to move forward, did they accept the suggestion of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, to negotiate an armistice with us. Since the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations on July 10, 1951, the path of negotiation has been long, tortuous, and complex. The reason for this is that the other party, with aggressive intentions, wanted to obtain through negotiation what they could not obtain on the battlefield. Of course, the development of the negotiations over the past two years has proved that this idea of the other party has no realistic basis at all and is therefore completely futile. All peace-loving people around the world do not like this idea and practice of the United States. The United States could not but realize that what they could not get from the battlefield, they would never get from negotiations. The Korean-Chinese side shattered the other party's delusions on the battlefield and insisted on resolving the issue through consultation in the negotiations. In this way, the armistice negotiations could reach an agreement on the issue of prisoners of war on the basis of the proposal put forward by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supported by the Soviet government on March 30 and 31 regarding a reasonable solution to the issue of prisoners of war, and the Korean armistice, which the people of the world had longed for, could be realized. From this, it can be seen that although the road to peace is difficult and tortuous, and it is not easy for the policy of peace to defeat the policy of war, as long as we adhere to a firm and unwavering policy of peace and insist on resolving issues through consultation, peace can be won. Peace is the unanimous aspiration of the people of the world, so the policy of peace is sincerely supported by the people of the world, while the policy of war that violates the will of the people of the world is doomed to failure.

    The Korean armistice has opened up a new situation in the peace movement. As everyone knows, since launching the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism has used the Korean War as an excuse to desperately expand its armaments, actively arm Japan and West Germany, organize aggressive blocs, clamor for anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments, create world tension, and promote new wars, thereby undermining beneficial international cooperation and seriously threatening world peace. The Korean issue has become the focus of world issues. The realization of the Korean armistice is the beginning of resolving international disputes by peaceful means and has greatly promoted the development of the world peace movement. As the Soviet "Pravda" editorial on May 24 pointed out, "Any step forward in resolving disputes will reduce the danger of war, help end the devastating arms race in various countries, and relieve the minds of millions of people." The Korean armistice will make it possible for countries to gradually resolve international disputes through negotiations. It provides conditions for further striving for international peace and security. Therefore, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is not only a victory for the Korean and Chinese people, but also a victory for the cause of peace of the people of the world. It has greatly encouraged the world's people's confidence in defending peace. There is no doubt that after the Korean armistice, the world's people's peace movement will have new upsurges and new developments.

    The glorious victory of the Korean armistice should be attributed to the great unity and heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people and to the strong assistance of the peace-loving people of the world to the Korean and Chinese people. As we celebrate the victory, we should pay tribute to all the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who fought heroically on the Korean front! Pay tribute to the heroic Korean people who endured all difficulties and contributed all their strength for the victory of the front! Pay tribute to Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people! Pay tribute to the people of the motherland who fully supported our operations in Korea! Pay tribute to our leader, Chairman Mao Zedong! Pay tribute to the peace-loving people of the world headed by the Soviet Union who have persisted in their struggle for the cause of peace! At the same time, we should extend our cordial greetings to the wounded and sick personnel and disabled personnel who have shown lofty patriotism and internationalism in the Korean War and devoted themselves to victory, and deeply mourn the martyrs who have contributed their precious lives for the sacred cause of peace!

    We warmly welcome the Korean armistice. We firmly support the Korean Armistice Agreement because it was signed after our continuous efforts. It fully conforms to the peaceful aspirations and interests of the Korean and Chinese people and is necessary for striving for world peace. This solemn agreement will take full effect twelve hours after it is signed. Every commander and fighter of our army must faithfully implement all the provisions stipulated in the Armistice Agreement and resolutely fight against any acts of the enemy that violate the Armistice Agreement to ensure the complete realization of the Armistice Agreement. We should understand that the Korean armistice is only the first step in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and only the beginning of the peaceful resolution of international disputes. The future task of our army is to work with the peace-loving people of the world to continue to strive unremittingly for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, for the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, and for the consolidation and lasting peace.

    While celebrating the Korean armistice, we should not forget that some warmongers in the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique have always opposed the Korean armistice. Syngman Rhee is still clamoring against the signing of the Armistice Agreement and is carrying out various conspiracies to undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and there is even the possibility of resorting to rogue tactics to break faith and disrupt the agreement again. This requires all commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army to, on the one hand, abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement and ensure the implementation of all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement; at the same time, they must be vigilant and not relax in the slightest, and there should be no thought of peace paralysis, and they must always prevent the provocations of the warmongers who oppose the armistice. If the implementation of the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement is undermined by the enemy, the Korean-Chinese side has the right to take self-defense actions against aggression in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and the guarantees provided by the United Nations Command to ensure the implementation of the Armistice provisions. Only in this way can we strive for a relatively stable armistice so that the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully. The Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world love peace and welcome peace. In the future, they will unite more closely and resolutely strive against aggression and defend peace.

### 热烈欢迎朝鲜停战，坚决维护停战协定

    热烈欢迎朝鲜停战，坚决维护停战协定
    中国人民志愿军政治部副主任　杜平
    一九五三年七月二十七日，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表与联合国军代表团首席代表在板门店正式签订了朝鲜停战协定，停止了打了三年零三十三天的朝鲜战争，实现了世界亿万人民的和平愿望。全世界爱好和平的人民都在为朝鲜停战的实现而鼓舞，为和平事业的又一次重大胜利而欢呼。我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，在这一反抗侵略、保卫和平的伟大斗争中贡献了自己的巨大力量，因此我们更感到无比的光荣与欣慰。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，标志着光辉的和平政策的胜利和美帝国主义战争政策的失败。当敌人发动朝鲜战争之初，苏联政府即倡议以和平方式解决朝鲜问题，朝中两国的政府和人民也屡次表示了同样的愿望，随后又为实现这个和平愿望作了不断的努力。但是美国方面不顾全世界善良人民的和平愿望，不顾苏联和朝中两国政府和人民和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张，一心想侵占全部朝鲜，并把战火燃烧到中国东北边境。只是在玩火者在军事上遭受了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的严重打击、被逼退回到他们发动战争的老地方、寸步不能前进的时候，他们才接受了当时苏联驻联合国代表马立克的建议，来和我们谈判停战。从一九五一年七月十日朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，谈判的道路是漫长的、曲折而复杂的，其原因就在于抱有侵略目的的对方想经过谈判来取得他们在战场上所得不到的东西。当然，两年多来的谈判发展证明对方的这种想法完全没有任何现实基础，因而是完全落空了的。全世界爱好和平人民都不欢喜美国的这种想法和做法。美国方面也不能不发觉他们从战场上所得不到的东西，从谈判中也是绝对得不到的。朝中方面在战场上击破了对方的妄想，在谈判中坚持了以协商精神来解决问题的办法。这样，停战谈判才能在今年三月三十、三十一日由中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所倡议而为苏联政府所支持的关于合理解决战俘问题的建议的基础上将战俘问题达成协议，全世界人民渴望已久的朝鲜停战才得以实现。由此可见虽然走向和平的道路是艰难曲折的，和平政策要战胜战争政策是不容易的，但是只要我们坚持坚定不移的和平政策，坚持以协商精神解决问题，和平是可以争取的。和平是全世界人民一致的愿望，因而和平政策得到全世界人民衷心的拥护，而违反世界人民意志的战争政策是注定要失败的。
    朝鲜停战打开了和平运动的新局面。人所共知，美帝国主义自发动侵朝战争以来，即以朝鲜战争为藉口，拚命扩充军备，积极武装日本，武装西德，组织侵略集团，叫嚣反苏反共，制造世界紧张局势，宣传新的战争，因而使国际间有益的合作被破坏，使世界和平受到严重的威胁。朝鲜问题成了世界问题的焦点。朝鲜停战的实现，是以和平方式解决国际纠纷的一个开端，大大地推动了世界和平运动的发展。正如苏联“真理报”五月二十四日社论中所指出的“在解决争端方面的任何一个前进的步骤，都会减少战争的危险，有助于终止使各国招致毁灭的扩张军备运动，并宽慰千百万人的心情。”朝鲜的停战将使各国之间用谈判方式逐步解决国际争端成为可能。为进一步争取国际间的和平与安全的斗争提供了条件。因此，朝鲜停战协定的签订不仅是朝中人民的胜利，也是全世界人民和平事业的胜利，它极大地鼓舞了全世界人民保卫和平的胜利信心。毫无疑问，朝鲜停战之后，世界人民的和平运动将有新的高涨和新的发展。
    朝鲜停战的光荣胜利应该归功于朝中人民的伟大团结和英勇斗争，归功于全世界爱好和平的人民对朝中人民的有力援助。当着我们庆祝胜利的时候，我们应该向在朝鲜前线英勇作战的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军全体指战员致敬！向为了前线的胜利而忍受一切困难，贡献了一切力量的英雄的朝鲜人民致敬！向朝鲜人民的领袖金日成元帅致敬！向以全力支援我们在朝鲜作战的祖国人民致敬！向我们的领袖毛泽东主席致敬！向为和平事业而坚持奋斗的以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民致敬！同时我们应该向在朝鲜战争中表现了崇高的爱国主义与国际主义精神，为了胜利而奋不顾身的伤病员，残废人员致以亲切的慰问，向为了神圣的和平事业而贡献了自己宝贵生命的烈士们致深切的悼念！
    我们热烈地欢迎朝鲜停战。我们坚决拥护朝鲜停战协定，因为它是经过我方不断努力而签订的。它完全符合朝中人民的和平愿望和利益，是争取世界和平所必需的。这个庄严的协定在签字以后十二小时起即全部生效。我军的每一个指战员必须忠实地执行停战协定中所规定的一切条款，并坚决地与敌人任何违反停战协定的行为作斗争，以保证停战协定的完全实现。我们应该懂得：朝鲜停战还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，还只是和平解决国际争端的开始。我军今后的任务是要与全世界爱好和平的人民一道为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为争取一切国际争端的和平解决，为争取巩固与持久的和平而继续奋斗不懈。
    在我们庆祝朝鲜停战的同时，我们不应该忘记美国的一部分好战分子和李承晚集团始终反对朝鲜停战，李承晚还在狂妄地叫嚣着反对签订停战协定，并且正在进行破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的种种预谋，甚至还有再度采取无赖手段背信弃义破坏协议的可能。这就要求我志愿军全体指战员，一方面要信守朝鲜停战协定，保证实施停战协定的全部条款；同时又要提高警惕，不应有丝毫松劲，更不应有和平麻痹思想，而必须时刻防止反停战的好战分子的挑衅。如果朝鲜停战协定条款的实施，一旦遭受敌人的破坏时，朝中方面有权根据停战协定以及联合国军所提供的保证，采取反侵略的自卫行动来保障停战条款的实施。只有这样才能争取一个比较稳定的停战使朝鲜问题得到和平解决的可能。朝中人民和全世界人民是热爱和平、欢迎和平的，今后更将团结一致坚决地为反对侵略、保卫和平而努力奋斗。（新华社）
