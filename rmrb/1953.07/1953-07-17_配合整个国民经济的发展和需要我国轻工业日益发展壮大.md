(Reported by this newspaper) During the new period of economic construction, the state is not only vigorously developing heavy industry, but also, based on the principle of fully improving and utilizing existing production equipment, is focusing on and planning the construction of light industry to coordinate with the development and needs of the entire national economy.

During the past three years of economic recovery, light industry, like other industries, has achieved rapid recovery and development. Last year, the main products of light industry exceeded the highest production levels in history. For example, cotton yarn exceeded the highest historical output by 51%, cotton cloth by 57%, paper by 123%, and automobile tires by 458%. These increases are mainly the result of improving the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment. Over the past three years, while improving the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment, some new factories have been added and old factories expanded according to the needs of national economic development. Many products that China has never been able to manufacture or unable to manufacture in large quantities can now be manufactured. For example, newsprint rolls, cement paper bags, automobile tires, ephedrine, penicillin, glucose, ultra-shortwave electrotherapy devices, and precision balances can all be manufactured using domestic raw materials, and some can already be produced in large quantities.

This year, there are a total of 137 new construction and expansion projects in the light industry system, of which eight are relatively large in scale. Some of these construction projects have already started, while others are still in the design or preparation stage. As of the end of June, the light industry system had completed 33.65% of the total basic construction workload for this year.

In the paper industry, in order to expand the supply of cultural and industrial paper, thirteen paper mills will be newly built and renovated this year. Among them, the larger ones are the expansion project of the Guangdong Paper Mill and the new construction project of the Jiamusi Paper Mill. The Guangdong Paper Mill is currently the best-equipped newsprint manufacturer in China. The expansion task this year is to install another sophisticated paper machine, restore the chemical wood pulp digester, and add a large wood grinder to double the output of newsprint compared to the current level. The entire expansion project of the factory will be completed in 1956, and the production capacity after the expansion will be increased four times. The Jiamusi Paper Mill has already started construction. The task this year is to build some dormitories and prepare for the project. The entire factory construction project is planned to be completed in 1957. At that time, it will become a large-scale comprehensive factory producing industrial paper.

In the rubber industry, starting this year, the two tire manufacturing plants in Northeast and East China will be expanded to increase their production capacity by more than double. This year, it is also planned to prepare for the construction of a large-scale automobile tire factory and a rubber parts and accessories factory to coordinate with the development of the transportation industry. After the completion of these expansion and new construction projects, China's automobile tires can basically achieve self-sufficiency, and the needs of the countryside for horse-drawn carriage tires can also be met.

The state has paid great attention to the pharmaceutical industry, which is closely related to the medical and healthcare of the people across the country. This year, the state has decided to build and expand a total of ten pharmaceutical factories, with the focus of construction being those that can manufacture special medicines. The sulfonamide factory to be established in a certain location is one of this year's key projects. The technical design of this factory is about to be completed, and construction can begin in the third quarter. It is expected to be completed by the end of next year. Sulfonamide is a widely effective anti-inflammatory drug. Currently, there is only a small amount of domestic production, and the cost is very high. Therefore, after this factory is completed, it will make a great contribution to China's medical undertakings. The state-owned Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory, which manufactures penicillin, has been expanded this year, and its production capacity can be increased by 7.7 times within the year. Another larger-scale antibiotic joint pharmaceutical factory is also under active preparation. This factory will take several years to complete, and it will produce a large amount of penicillin and streptomycin (a medicine for treating lung diseases), bringing good news to patients. In terms of medical equipment, a precision medical equipment manufacturing plant is currently being planned for construction. The Shanghai Equipment No. 2 Factory has successfully trial-produced X-ray machines. This year, the first batch of large X-ray machines will be supplied to hospitals, and a new factory will be built before 1956 to expand production.

In the food industry, the current focus of construction is the sugar industry. In the sugarcane production area of ​​the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, a new large-scale sugarcane sugar factory has appeared this year, which can be put into production in November. By the end of this year, two local state-owned beet sugar factories in Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces in Northeast China will also be completed. At that time, the number of large machine-made sugar factories in my country will increase to more than ten, and the output of machine-made sugar will also increase greatly.

In the textile industry, it is planned to add one million spindles in the next few years. Currently, complete sets of textile machinery can be self-made, cotton for textiles is self-sufficient and there is a surplus, and the expansion and new construction projects of textile factories are also starting this year. In addition, in the light industry system, there are also some basic construction projects in salt, tobacco, alcohol, and other aspects, which are also under construction and preparation.

With the further development of light industry, the colonial nature of light industry in old China will be fundamentally transformed. The equipment and raw materials of light industry in old China all depended on imports from abroad. Since the liberation of the whole country, self-sufficiency in raw materials and equipment has been gradually achieved. Due to the great development of basic industries in light industry, the appearance of the semi-finished product processing industry, which used to serve the surplus goods of imperialism, will also be changed. The deformed state of light industry concentrated in a few coastal cities far away from raw materials and sales areas will also be changed. Many areas that never had or had very little industry in the past have established or are about to establish modern large-scale light industrial factories.

    配合整个国民经济的发展和需要我国轻工业日益发展壮大
    【本报讯】在经济建设的新时期中，国家不仅大力发展重工业，而且在充分地改进和利用现有生产设备的原则下，配合整个国民经济的发展和需要，有重点有计划地建设轻工业。
    在过去三年经济恢复时期中，轻工业和其它工业一样得到了迅速的恢复与发展。去年轻工业的各项主要产品超过了历史上的最高生产水平。如棉纱已超过历史上最高产量百分之五十一，棉布超过百分之五十七，纸张超过百分之一百二十三，汽车轮胎超过百分之四百五十八。这些产品的增长，主要是提高现有的机器设备利用率的结果。三年来，与提高现有机器设备利用率同时，根据发展国民经济的需要，增加了一些新厂和扩建了旧厂。许多我国历来不能制造或无法大量制造的产品，都能制造了，如卷筒新闻纸、水泥纸袋、汽车轮胎、麻黄素、盘尼西林、葡萄糖、超短波电疗器、精密天平等，都能用国产原料制造，有的已能大量生产。
    今年，轻工业系统的新建和扩建工程共计一百三十七个，其中规模较大的有八个。这些建设工程有的已经动工，有的还在设计或筹备阶段。到六月底为止，轻工业系统已完成今年基本建设工作总量的百分之三十三点六五。
    在造纸工业方面，为了扩大文化用纸和工业用纸的供应量，今年将新建和改建十三个造纸厂。其中规模较大的有广东造纸厂的扩建工程和佳木斯造纸厂的新建工程。广东造纸厂是目前我国设备最好的新闻纸制造厂，今年的扩建任务就是要安装好另一部精良的造纸机，并恢复化学木浆蒸煮锅和增设大型磨木机，使新闻纸的产量比目前提高一倍。该厂整个的扩建工程将在一九五六年完成，扩建后的生产能力将提高四倍。佳木斯造纸厂已开始施工，今年的任务是建设一部分宿舍和准备工程，全部建厂工程计划在一九五七年完成，到那时候，它将成为
    一个规模宏大的生产工业用纸的综合工厂。
    在橡胶工业方面，今年起将扩建东北、华东的两个轮胎制造厂，把它们的生产能力提高一倍以上。今年还计划筹建一个大规模的汽车轮胎厂和橡胶配件杂品工厂，以配合交通运输事业的发展。这些扩建和新建工程完成后，我国的汽车轮胎基本上可以做到自给，农村对马车轮胎的需要也可得到满足。
    国家对于和全国人民的医疗保健事业有密切关系的制药工业，给予了极大的注意。今年国家决定新建和扩建的药厂共有十个，其中建设的重点是那些能制造特效药品的药厂。将设立在某地的磺胺工厂就是今年的重点工程之一，这个工厂的技术设计即将完成，第三季度可以施工，预定到明年年底建成。磺胺是消炎的一种效能很广的药物，目前国内只有少量生产，而且成本很高，所以这个工厂建成以后，对于我国的医疗事业将有很大贡献。制造青霉素（即盘尼西林）的国营上海药厂今年已进行了扩建，生产能力在年内就可提高七点七倍。另外一座规模更大的抗生素联合药厂也正在积极筹建中，这座工厂需几年时间建成，它将生产大量的青霉素、链霉素（这是医治肺病的一种药剂），为病患者带来福音。在医疗器械方面，目前有一个精密医疗器械制造厂正在计划建设中。上海器材二厂试制X光机已经成功，今年将有第一批大型X光机供应给医院，并将在一九五六年前建设新厂，扩大生产。
    在食品工业方面，目前的建设重点是制糖工业，在广东珠江三角洲的甘蔗产区，今年又出现了一座新的大型甘蔗糖厂，它在十一月间就可以投入生产。今年年底，在东北松江和黑龙江两省，有两座地方国营的甜菜糖厂也将建设完成，到那时候，我国的大型机器制糖厂就将增加到十座以上，机制糖的产量也将大大增加。
    在纺织工业方面，今后几年内计划增加一百万纱锭。目前全套纺织机械已能自制，纺织用棉自给且有盈余，纺织厂的扩建和新建工程今年也在开始进行。此外，在轻工业系统中，还有食盐、烟、酒和其他方面的一些基本建设工程，也在建设和筹建中。
    随着轻工业的进一步发展，旧中国轻工业的殖民地性将获得根本改造。旧中国轻工业的设备与原料都依赖国外输入，全国解放以来，才逐步做到了原料、设备自给。由于轻工业中的基本工业的壮大发展，过去为帝国主义剩余商品服务半制品的改装工业面貌也将为之改观。过去轻工业集中于远离原料与销售区的沿海少数城市的畸形状态，也将得到改变，许多过去从来没有或只有很少工业的地区都已建立或即将建立现代化的大规模的轻工业工厂。
