    Joy and Vigilance
    ——On the Signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    By Our Special Correspondent Lin Wei

    The world-瞩目 Korean armistice negotiations, in the Korean classical-style hall newly built in Panmunjom specifically for holding the signing ceremony, both sides formally signed the armistice agreement. The time was 10:00 a.m. on July 27, 1953. The people of all countries involved in the Korean War, and even the people of the whole world, will not forget this memorable day and memorable moment. If the agreement is not violated again, then this most brutal war, launched by the American aggressors and lasting for more than three years, will come to a halt. By 10:00 p.m. on the 30th, the armies of both sides will withdraw two kilometers from the front line to establish a demilitarized zone. Immediately afterwards, the prisoners of war will also return home and reunite with their parents, wives, and children. American soldiers may really have the chance to go back to America for Christmas.

    Although the Syngman Rhee clique and their backers have insisted that opposition to the armistice is the will of the people, and continue to clamor for the continuation of the war after some time, the true will of the people is completely opposed to the clamor of the warmongers. More than a month ago, when the second military demarcation line was just drawn, the people here began to prepare for celebrations. How upright, honest, and kind the people are! How much they desire peace and love peace! But at this time, the Syngman Rhee clique's tearing up of the prisoner of war repatriation agreement and forced detention of more than 27,000 of our captured personnel poured a bucket of ice water on the people's enthusiasm for peace. Hundreds of workers in Panmunjom, who were sweating to build the signing hall, put down their tools and stopped working. Everyone said in unison with indignation: "Punish Syngman Rhee!"

    After the negotiations restarted in mid-July under our efforts to save the situation, the U.S. side made guarantees to abide by the agreement, and the South Korean army suffered a serious blow on the eastern front at the same time. People's hopes emerged once again. When the Korean and Chinese workers resumed construction of the signing hall on the 20th, their morale was high. They worked day and night, completing the work on schedule in four days with amazing speed. From the roof to the doors and windows, steps, floors, and ceilings, from the style to the details, no one was perfunctory because it was a temporary building. During the same period, many workers also rushed to repair the bridge near Panmunjom. Some Chinese workers gave a thumbs up and said, "For peace, we'll be as fast as possible, as good as possible!" To express their love for peace, they installed beautiful doves at the entrance of the signing hall. But the U.S. side insisted on opposing it, saying that it was a one-sided symbol.

    Yesterday (the 26th) afternoon, when the loudspeakers in Kaesong and Panmunjom suddenly broadcast the news that the signing ceremony would be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th, the crowd boiled once again. Many hats were thrown into the sky; many children shouted and ran to tell each other. People quickly gathered in large numbers in front of the blackboard newspapers, and the sounds of laughter emanating from their hearts were overflowing. Until late at night, the loudspeakers were still broadcasting bright voices and songs. At five o'clock in the morning, it woke people up again. However, people have learned from experience that whether the Syngman Rhee gang, which belongs to the U.S. side, will abide by the armistice agreement and whether it will not be destroyed again will depend on the situation later.

    Inside the signing hall, everything was completely equal. The flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the flag of the United Nations, flown by the sixteen countries headed by the United States, stood side by side on the signing table. The number of personnel on both sides of the table was equal. There was no chairman of the meeting, and both sides had exactly the same rights. The same is true of the provisions of the agreement: no one can seize an inch of anyone's land, and no one can interfere in anyone's sovereignty... The imperialist prestige and privileged status have been swept away here in every respect.

    The representatives of the "United Nations" sat almost silently, without saying a word, in the positions they should have been in. They pursed their lips, and there was not a trace of a smile on their faces. Before the signing, they looked at their watches from time to time, and then at the United Nations flag that had been desecrated by them and dulled by three years of sinful war, and then turned their faces elsewhere or lowered their heads. From beginning to end, they were silent until the signing, until they got up and walked out of the doors they were supposed to walk out of... This cannot but remind people of the scene when they first came to negotiate two years ago. At that time, they did not seem to be coming to negotiate at all. They repeatedly said that they wanted to "let the bombs speak," "let the bombs argue," and "let the bombs solve the problem." But, a full two years have passed, and planes and artillery have not helped them achieve anything, and the front line has always been moving south step by step. The voices of dissatisfaction from the people all over the world and the noises inside them are increasing day by day. Finally, they discovered that the best option was still to sit down and negotiate, and to sign the armistice agreement.

    The personnel on the Korean and Chinese side, as always, were serious and calm. They were excited and gratified by today's progress, and at the same time vigilantly watched out for all possible sabotage from the other side. How about the people? The same is true. The only thing they care about today is whether Syngman Rhee will destroy the agreement again, and whether the United States will earnestly fulfill its guarantees for the implementation of the agreement. The workers who rushed to build the signing hall and repair the bridges in Panmunjom, the farmers who stopped farming to celebrate the armistice, the adult and underage male and female students, are all exploring and closely watching this issue. They have a desire for peace and a strong will to defend peace. When talking about her feelings about the armistice, 21-year-old Li Lian-shu said: "I want an armistice, but Syngman Rhee and the American aggressors have different hearts from me. They may create some incidents at any time to undermine the armistice. I used to be in the fifth grade at Mingde Girls' High School, and I was unable to graduate in a year because the enemy launched a war of aggression. My father died in the war due to poverty and malnutrition. If the enemy wants to launch another war, I will fight them!" Huang Shang-shun, a 64-year-old poor peasant, has two sons in the People's Army. He said: "If the enemy comes again, I, an old man, will go and do it. It's worth it to fight one of them!"

    If the person playing with fire hasn't played enough, let him listen to the voice of the people.

### 欢乐和警惕——记板门店停战协定的签字

    欢乐和警惕
    ——记板门店停战协定的签字
    本报特派记者  林韦
    举世注目的朝鲜停战谈判，在板门店专为举行签字仪式而新建的朝鲜古典式大厅中，双方在停战协定上正式签字了。时间是一九五三年七月二十七日上午十时。朝鲜交战双方有关各国的人民以至全世界人民，将不会忘记这个可纪念的日子和可纪念的时刻。如果协定不再遭受破坏的话，那么，这个由美国侵略者发动的延续了三年多的最残酷的战争就要停火了。到三十日下午十时止，双方军队就要从火线各向后撤退二公里而建立非军事区了。紧接着，战俘们也要回家和他们的父母妻儿欢聚了。美国的兵士们，也真的有可能回美国去过圣诞节了。
    尽管李承晚集团和他的后台老板硬把反对停战说成是人民的要求，继续嚷叫着要在若干时日之后继续战争，但真实的人民意志和好战者们的嚷叫是完全敌对的。还在一个多月以前，第二次军事分界线刚刚划定的时候，这里的人民就开始准备庆祝了。人民是多么正直、诚实和善良啊！他们多么希望和平、热爱和平啊！但是，这时候，李承晚集团撕毁遣返战俘协议、强迫扣留二万七千多名我方被俘人员的事件，像一瓢冰水一样把人民的和平热情浇冷了。板门店正在淌着大汗赶建签字大厅的数百工人，收起了工具，停止工作了。所有的人同声愤慨地说：“惩罚李承晚！”
    七月中旬谈判在我方挽救之下重新开始以后，美方对于遵守协定提出了保证，南朝鲜军队同时在东线遭到严重打击。人们的希望再一次浮现上来。朝中工人们在二十日复工兴建签字厅时，情绪是高昂的。他们日夜不息地劳作着，以惊人的速度在四天内按期完工。从屋顶到门窗、台阶、地板、天花板，从式样到细工，没有人因为它是临时用的建筑而马虎从事。同一期间，许多工人把板门店附近的大桥也突击修好了。一些中国来的工人翘起大姆指说：“为了和平，要多快有多快，要多好有多好！”为了表示对和平的热爱，他们在签字厅门首装了美丽的鸽子。但美方坚持反对，硬说那是一方面的标志。
    昨天（二十六日）下午扩音器在开城、板门店突然播送出二十七日早晨十点举行签字仪式的消息时，人群又一次沸腾起来。许多帽子抛向天空；许多孩子大喊起来，奔走相告。人们在黑板报前大堆地迅速聚集着，从内心发散出来的笑语声洋溢着，直至深夜，扩音器仍在发出朗朗的话声与歌声。清晨五点，它又把人们唤醒了。但是，人们已经从经验中得知：属于美方的李承晚匪帮是否会遵守停战协定，是否不会再破坏，是要看一看以后的情形才能知道的。
    签字厅内，所有一切都是完全对等的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜和以美国为首的十六个国家所打的联合国的旗帜，并立在签字桌上。桌子两旁，双方人员的数目是相等的。会议没有主席，双方有完全相同的权利。协定的条文也是如此：谁也不能割取谁的一寸土地，谁也不能干涉谁的任何主权……。帝国主义的威风和特权地位，在这里从一切方面被扫除净尽了。
    “联合国”的代表们，几乎是一声不响、一言不发地坐在他们应该坐的位置上。他们紧扣着嘴，脸上没有一丝笑容。签字之前，他们不时地看看手表，又看看那只被他们奸污了的、被三年来的罪恶战争涂抹得黯然无光了的联合国旗，然后又把脸转向别处，或低下头去。一直到签字，一直到起身走出他们应该走的门……自始至终默默无言。这使人不能不联想到二年前他们开始来谈判的情景。那时节，他们根本不像是来作谈判，他们口口声声要“让炸弹发言”，“让炸弹争辩”，“让炸弹解决问题”。但是，整整二年过去了，飞机大炮没有帮助他们取得什么，而且战线总在步步南移。全世界人民对他们不满的呼声和他们内部的吵闹声都在逐日增高。最后，他们发现了最好的选择仍然是坐下来协商，并且在停战协定上签字。
    朝中方面的人员和往常一样，神色是严谨的，冷静的。他们为今天的进展而感到兴奋和欣慰，同时警惕地注视着对方的一切可能的破坏。人民呢？也是如此。他们今天唯一关怀的事情，是李承晚会不会再破坏协定，美国会不会认真履行自己对于实施协定的保证。在板门店赶造签字厅和赶修桥梁的工人们，停止了耕作来庆祝停战的农民们，成年的和未成年的男女学生们，都在探询并密切注视着这一问题。他们有对于和平的渴望，也有保卫和平的强烈意志。二十一岁的姑娘李怜淑在谈述她对停战的感想时说：“我愿意停战，可是李承晚和美国侵略者的心跟我不一样。他们也许在什么时候还会制造一些什么事件来破坏停战的。我以前在明德女中念五年级，因为敌人发动侵略战争，差一年没有能毕业。我的父亲在战争中因穷困和营养不良死去了。如果敌人还要发动战争，我要和他们拚！”六十四岁的贫农黄上顺，有两个儿子在人民军中。他说：“敌人要再来，我这个老头子也要去干了。拚他一个也合算！”
    玩火的人如果还没有玩够，请他听听人民的声音吧。
        一九五三年七月二十七日于开城
