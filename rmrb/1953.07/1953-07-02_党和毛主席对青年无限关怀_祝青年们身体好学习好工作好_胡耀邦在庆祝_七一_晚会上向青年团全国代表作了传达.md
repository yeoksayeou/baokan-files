We, the representatives of the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, representing all Youth League members and the youth of the whole country, extend warm congratulations to our organizers and leaders - the glorious, great, and correct Communist Party of China, and to our most beloved mentor, the genius leader of the Party and the people, Comrade Mao Zedong! He said that with the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, our youth have the happy life we have now and a better future. He then said: The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong show exceptional care for the youth. Just yesterday, Comrade Mao Zedong asked us to convey to everyone: He celebrates the youth's good health, good studies, and good work. He kindly taught the youth: In order to work better for the motherland, we must first grow in body and knowledge. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong care so lovingly for the growth of the youth, and are constantly paying attention to guiding the youth towards an infinitely bright future. His words aroused a storm of applause and cheers from the audience.

Centered on the Altar of Land and Grain, south to the entrance, north to Zhongshan Hall; west to the Children's Sports Field, east to the Music Hall; everywhere were revelers. Among them, the Altar of Land and Grain was the most eye-catching, with shining colored lights forming a huge and brilliant five-pointed star. As the radio broadcast music, soldiers, workers, peasants, students, government cadres, and Young Pioneers formed countless crowds, singing and dancing enthusiastically. Foreign guests also participated in the dancing.

In the past four years, the China New Democratic Youth League has assisted the Party in achieving great achievements on all fronts.
