    In order to popularize track and field and gymnastics, improve technical levels, and promote cycling, the All-China Sports Federation has decided to hold the “1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Sports Meet” in Beijing from October 2nd to 5th this year. The units participating in the meet include: North China Region, Northeast Region, Northwest Region, East China Region, Central South Region, Southwest Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chinese People's Liberation Army, China Railway Sports Association, and other nine units. Competition events: (1) Track and field – men's events include 21 items, and women's events include 13 items; (2) Gymnastics – men's competition events include: horizontal bar, parallel bars, vaulting horse, free exercise (including calisthenics, balance movements, floor exercises, etc.) and other four items, women's competition events include: parallel bars, side horse, free exercise (including rhythmic calisthenics, balance movements, floor exercises, etc.) and other three items. In gymnastics, there will also be men's rings and pommel horse performances, and women's balance beam and uneven bars performances; (3) Cycling competition events – men's events include 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters; women's events include 1,500 meters, 3,000 meters, 5,000 meters.
    After the All-China Sports Federation issued notices to various regions, many provinces and cities have successively held sports meets and conducted selection competitions.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army held a selection meet for apparatus exercises and weightlifting in Guangzhou in early June. On July 10th, 13th, and 16th, the army also held track and field selection meets in Beijing and Nanjing. The results of these selection meets showed significant progress compared to the 1952 "August 1st" All-Army Sports Meet. For example, the grades of weightlifting in each level have exceeded last year’s levels, and each weightlifter can lift 30 to 45 kilograms more than last year; apparatus exercises have also become more skillful than last year, and all-around events have become common.
    The 4th Qingdao People's Sports Meet was held from July 5th to 9th. More than 2,000 athletes from workers, students, farmers, government cadres, and street laborers participated in the meet. The meet included track and field, tug-of-war, apparatus exercises, cycling, boxing, and weightlifting competitions. As a result of the competitions, five track and field results broke national records; and the results of 45 events of 149 people broke the highest records of Shandong Province or Qingdao City. For example, in the men's 5,000-meter long-distance race, construction worker You Yunting completed the entire distance in only 15 minutes and 48.2 seconds. This result broke the national highest record of 15 minutes and 56.2 seconds at the National Excellent Track and Field Athletes Selection Meet held in Beijing this year.
    The 1953 Zhejiang Provincial Track and Field, Gymnastics, Weightlifting, and National Form Sports Selection Meet was held on July 15th and 16th. Many excellent athletes emerged in this meet. For example, in the men’s 200-meter low hurdles, Yu Zhangyan broke the national record of 28.8 seconds from last year with a time of 28.1 seconds. He also broke the national highest record of 1 minute and 2.4 seconds for the 400-meter intermediate hurdles from last year with a time of 1 minute and 1.8 seconds. In the women’s hand grenade throw, Zong Rujing broke the national highest record of 39.81 meters from last year with a score of 41.20 meters.
    Changchun City also held the 5th People's Sports Meet from June 18th to 21st. The number of worker and women athletes participating in the meet increased unprecedentedly. Wuhan City also held a city-wide track and field competition in June. The 1953 Guangzhou Apparatus Gymnastics Performance was held on July 19th, and outstanding athletes were selected to participate in the Central South Region Apparatus Gymnastics Sports Competition.
    The Beijing Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Athlete Selection Meet is scheduled to be held separately in Beijing from late July to early August. The boxing selection competition was held on the 15th and 16th. The gymnastics selection competition was also held on the 19th. The 1953 Shanghai Weightlifting and Boxing Selection Competition is scheduled to be held in Shanghai in early August. North China Region and East China Region will both hold regional sports meets in August, and outstanding athletes will be selected at the meets to participate in the “1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Sports Meet."
