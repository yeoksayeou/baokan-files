    The recovery of Zhejiang's silk industry
    Qian Zhuting
    Silkworm production is the main sideline production for approximately 530,000 farmers in 32 silk-producing counties and cities in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas of Zhejiang, as well as parts of eastern Zhejiang. Silk farmers in the Jiahu area have a saying: "Rely on silkworms in the first half of the year, and rely on the fields in the second half." In counties such as Deqing, Wuxing, Chongde, and Haining, silkworm production accounts for about 30% of the total annual agricultural production income. The success of silkworm cocoon harvests is closely related to the lives and production of farmers in silk-producing areas. Based on the spring cocoon income last year, the provincial average income per sericultural household was more than 450 kilograms of rice, which could sustain a family of four for nearly three months.
    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the mulberry garden area in Zhejiang reached more than 2.6 million mu, and the silkworm area covered 58 counties (cities), with more than 950,000 sericultural households. It once produced 1 million dan of fresh cocoons (including native cocoons). However, from the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan to before liberation, the mulberry gardens suffered severe damage from Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the price of silk cocoons plummeted. Half of the original mulberry gardens were lost. In 1949, the output of improved fresh cocoons was only about 150,000 dan. In the four years since liberation, the People's Government has implemented the correct policy of vigorously supporting and steadily restoring production, adopting planned distribution of silkworm eggs and reasonable cocoon price policies, and implementing comprehensive forced hatching and organizing joint rearing, and other positive technical guidance, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses for production. In 1952, the output of improved fresh cocoons increased by 50.26% compared with 1950, and the number of silkworm eggs distributed increased by 47.66%. On the basis of three consecutive years of bumper harvests, this year further mobilized silkworm farmers to organize and strengthen technical guidance, thus achieving even greater bumper harvests than in the past.
    This spring, the province distributed more than 870,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs. From early to mid-April, silkworm farmers began to hatch. The eastern Zhejiang area harvested cocoons in late May, generally entering the peak cocoon harvesting period in early June, and the purchase ended in mid-June. The province initially estimates a total output of 418,000 dan of fresh cocoons, an increase of 8% over last year. The quality of cocoons has also improved significantly this year. Among the fresh cocoons purchased throughout the province, the first to sixth grades accounted for 84.7% of the total purchase volume. Due to the bumper harvest of spring cocoons, the rural economy in silkworm areas has become active, and the purchasing power of silkworm farmers has increased. Taking the silkworm farmers near Ximiao Bridge in Deqing County as an example, from May 31 to June 7, in eight days, farmers purchased 4,500 chi of cotton cloth, 13,200 jin of bean cake, 440 jin of flour, 21,000 jin of rice, and other means of production and living materials from the local grassroots cooperatives.
    Last winter and this spring, counties and districts universally convened meetings of sericultural farmer representatives. These meetings clarified the role of sericultural production in national economic construction to the sericultural farmers, changing the past idea of valuing silkworms over mulberry trees. After the meeting, the mulberry garden cultivation work in various places was strengthened, and the amount of fertilizer applied to mulberry gardens increased more than in previous years. For example, in Changsha Township, Fuyang, in addition to the 432 mu of new sandy land, the remaining 918 mu of old mulberry land applied 20,851 jin of bean cake, 286,960 jin of stable manure, and 161,300 jin of human manure, an increase of 28.5 times in stable manure and 5.9 times in human manure compared with last year. In order to solve the difficulties of poor sericultural farmers in purchasing mulberry garden fertilizer, the People's Government lent 6.9 billion yuan in mulberry garden fertilizer loans throughout the province, solving the fertilizer problem for more than 70,000 mu of mulberry gardens. The fertilizer application area of mulberry gardens in Deqing County reached 98% of the total mulberry land area. Although the mulberry trees in some areas suffered from late frost, evening snow and long-term low temperatures before and after sprouting, and several major silkworm areas such as Hangzhou City, Zhuji, Haining, Haiyan, Deqing, Chongde, Tongxiang, and Wuxing suffered from hail in early May, which greatly affected the mulberry buds, the province's mulberry leaf production still increased by about 10% compared with the spring of 1952.
    This year, various places have strengthened technical guidance for sericultural farmers and guided them to further organize. In mid-February, common rearing farmer training was universally held in various places, training 30,383 sericultural activists throughout the province. Through common rearing training, the province sorted out and organized about 16,000 young silkworm common rearing rooms, with 521,172 sheets of silkworm eggs participating in the common rearing rooms, accounting for 59.77% of the total distribution, an increase of 31.61% compared with 1952. The number of strong silkworm common rearing rooms also increased compared with last year. In areas with a relatively solid foundation for the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the common rearing rooms have been preliminarily combined with year-round mutual aid groups, achieving a division of labor between agricultural and sideline industries, which not only guarantees the bumper harvest of sericultural production but also ensures that agricultural production is not delayed. In terms of improving silkworm rearing technology, the first is to absorb advanced Soviet experience, reduce the silkworm egg hatching temperature, and ensure the strength of the ant silkworms. The second is thorough disinfection to prevent silkworm diseases. The masses in the silkworm area universally washed and dried the sericultural tools and cleaned the silkworm houses before rearing silkworms. The common rearing rooms generally used medicines for disinfection. The use of scientific sericultural tools was also more than last year. For example, the number of small silkworm nets in Hangzhou County increased by 558% compared with last year, and the number of hygrometers and thermometers increased by 235% compared with last year. This overcame various unfavorable natural conditions, reduced the invasion of diseases, and provided a major guarantee for the bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons.
    This year's silkworm cocoon purchase price implemented the policy of "maintaining the current situation and steadily developing in the future." Although the purchase price was appropriately lowered, due to the universal bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons this spring, the income from selling cocoons for silkworm farmers is still not lower than in 1951, and some high-yield common rearing rooms have even exceeded 1952. For example, in Xubaorong Common Rearing Room, 12th Village, Nanri Township, Tudian District, Tongxiang, each dan of fresh cocoons sold for 830,000 yuan last year, with an average income of 335,700 yuan per sheet of silkworm eggs; this year, each dan sold for 750,000 yuan, but due to the increase in output and quality, the average income per sheet of silkworm eggs was 390,040 yuan, an increase of more than 54,000 yuan compared with last year. This year, sericultural farmers throughout the province have pre-ordered 150,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs for 1953, accounting for 65% of the total distribution, actively preparing for autumn silkworm production.
    Due to the continuous bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons in the past four years, some leading organs have developed a tendency of blind advancement in silkworm production. For example, pursuing quantity in common rearing organizations, seeking more and bigger; blindly supporting the development of mulberry seedling production; neglecting the agricultural regionality and the production status of the small peasant economy in the promotion of science and technology, and not considering the production costs and acceptance level of the masses, thus deviating from the actual requirements of the masses; providing technical guidance only for common rearing rooms and neglecting individual households, etc. In order to improve its work, the provincial leading organs are preparing to summarize and check the leadership style through sericultural work, and on this basis, deploy the autumn silkworm production work.

    恢复中的浙江蚕桑事业
    钱竹亭
    蚕桑生产是浙江杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）一带以及浙东部分地区三十二个蚕区县市约五十三万农民主要的副业生产。嘉湖地区的蚕农有“上半年靠蚕，下半年靠田”的俗语。德清、吴兴、崇德、海宁等县蚕桑生产的比重都占全年农业生产总收入的百分之三十左右。蚕茧的丰收与否，和蚕区农民的生活与生产有很大关系。根据去年春茧收入的情况来看，全省平均每户蚕农收入大米在四百五十斤以上，可以维持一家四口近三个月的口粮。
    在抗战以前，浙江桑园面积曾达二百六十余万亩，蚕桑区域遍及五十八县（市），养蚕农民有九十五万余户，曾产鲜茧一百万担（包括土茧）。但从抗日战争开始到解放以前，桑园受到日本帝国主义及国民党反动派的惨重破坏，丝茧跌价，原有桑园损失了一半。一九四九年改良鲜茧产量仅有十五万担左右。解放四年来，人民政府实行了大力扶植与稳步恢复的正确方针，采取了蚕种计划配销及合理的茧价政策，并实行全面催青，组织共育等积极的技术指导，群众的生产积极性大为提高。一九五二年改良鲜茧产量比一九五○年增产百分之五十点二六，蚕种配发数增多了百分之四十七点六六。在连续三年丰收的基础上，今年进一步发动蚕农组织起来，加强了技术指导，因此取得了较以往更大的丰收。
    今春全省配发改良蚕种八十七万多张。自四月初、中旬起，蚕农即陆续开始催青。浙东地区于五月下旬采茧，一般在六月上旬进入采茧旺期，至中旬收购结束。全省初步估计共产鲜茧四十一万八千担，比去年增产百分之八。今年茧质也有显著提高，全省收购的鲜茧中，第一级至第六级的占总收购量百分之八十四点七。由于春茧丰收，蚕区农村经济活跃了，蚕农的购买力提高了。以德清县西庙桥附近蚕农为例，自五月三十一日至六月七日八天中，农民在当地基层合作社购买了棉布四千五百尺，豆饼一万三千二百斤，面粉四百四十斤，大米二万一千斤，以及其他的生产资料与生活资料。
    去冬今春，各地普遍地召开了县区蚕农代表会议，这些会议使蚕农们明确了蚕桑生产对国家经济建设的作用，改变了过去重蚕轻桑的思想。会后，各地的桑园培育工作加强了，桑园施肥的数量比历年都增加了。如富阳长沙乡除四百三十二亩的新沙地外，其余九百十八亩老桑地施了豆饼二万零八百五十一斤，厩肥二十八万六千九百六十斤，人粪十六万一千三百斤，比去年增施厩肥二十八倍半，人粪五点九倍。人民政府为了解决贫苦蚕农购买桑园肥料的困难，在全省范围内贷放了桑园肥料贷款六十九亿元，使七万多亩桑园施肥的问题获得解决。德清全县的桑园施肥面积达桑地总面积的百分之九十八。虽然部分地区的桑树在发芽前后遭受了晚霜暮雪与长期低温的侵害，五月上旬杭市、诸暨、海宁、海盐、德清、崇德、桐乡、吴兴等几个主要蚕区又遭受了冰雹侵袭，桑芽受到很大影响，但全省桑叶产量仍比一九五二年春期增产一成左右。
    今年各地对蚕农加强了技术指导，并引导蚕农进一步组织起来。二月中旬，各地普遍举办了共育蚕农的训练，全省训练了养蚕积极分子三万零三百八十三人，通过共育训练，全省整理与组织的稚蚕共育室约有一万六千个，参加共育室的蚕种有五十二万一千一百七十二张，占总配发数的百分之五十九·七七，比一九五二年增加百分之三十一·六一。壮蚕共育室也比去年增加了。在互助合作运动较有基础地区，共育室已初步与常年互助组结合，做到农副业分工，不但保证了养蚕生产的丰收，也保证了农业生产不误农时。在改进养蚕技术方面，首先是吸收了苏联先进经验，减低了蚕种催青温度，保障了蚁体的强健。其次是彻底消毒，预防蚕病。蚕区群众在养蚕前普遍洗晒了蚕具，打扫了蚕室。共育室一般做到用药品消毒。科学养蚕用具的使用也比去年为多，如杭县的小蚕网比去年增加百分之五百五十八，干湿计与寒暑表比去年增加百分之二百三十五。这就克服了各种不利的自然条件，减少了病害的侵袭，使蚕茧丰收有了重大的保证。
    今年的蚕茧收购价格，贯彻了“目前维持，将来稳步发展”的方针，虽然适当调低了收价，但由于今春蚕茧普遍丰收，蚕农售茧收入仍不低于一九五一年，部分丰产共育室还超过了一九五二年。如桐乡屠甸区南日乡十二村许宝荣共育室，去年每担鲜茧卖八十三万元，每张蚕种平均收入三十三万五千七百元；今年每担卖七十五万元，由于产量与质量的提高，每张蚕种平均收入三十九万零四十元，比去年多收入五万四千余元。今年全省蚕农预订一九五三年秋蚕种已有十五万张，占配发总数的百分之六五，积极为秋蚕生产作准备。
    由于四年来蚕茧连续丰收，某些领导机关在蚕茧生产上滋长了盲目冒进的倾向。如在共育组织上追求数量，贪多求大；在桑苗生产上盲目扶持发展；在科学技术的推广上忽视农业的地域性与小农经济的生产现状，不考虑群众的生产成本与接受程度，因而与群众的实际要求脱节；技术指导上单纯照顾共育室，忽视单干户，等等。省的领导机关为了改进工作，准备通过养蚕工作，总结检查领导作风，在这一基础上布置秋蚕生产工作。
