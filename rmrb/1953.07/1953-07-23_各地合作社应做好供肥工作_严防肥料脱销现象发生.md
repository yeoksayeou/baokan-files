    Cooperatives in Various Regions Should Do a Good Job in Supplying Fertilizer; Strictly Prevent Fertilizer Stockouts

    Li Zhuoyun of the Yutian County Cooperative Union in Hebei Province writes: The Yutian County Cooperative Union, in its recent inspection of fertilizer supply work in various primary-level cooperatives, has successively discovered fertilizer stockouts in five distribution stores and one sales department of three primary-level cooperatives. Among them, the Meng Dazhuang and Xu Jia Hutong distribution stores of the Shijiwo Cooperative, due to a lack of prior preparation and only having two to three thousand jin of chemical fertilizer in stock, were completely bought out by the masses in two days after the rain, resulting in a one-day suspension of sales and a shortage of six to seven hundred jin of chemical fertilizer. Two distribution stores and one sales department of the Hongqiao Cooperative also suspended sales for half a day due to insufficient chemical fertilizer, resulting in a shortage of more than five thousand jin of chemical fertilizer. In particular, the sales department of this cooperative ran out of supply at twelve o'clock on the day of the market (June 27th), and the masses complained: Isn't the cooperative supposed to serve production? Why doesn't it prepare enough fertilizer when the masses need topdressing? Isn't this affecting production?

    According to the inspection results, the reasons for the fertilizer stockouts are:

    I. The primary-level cooperatives lack ideological leadership over the distribution stores, resulting in a spontaneous flow in the fertilizer supply work. For example, the Meng Dazhuang and Xu Jia Hutong distribution stores of the Shijiwo Cooperative underestimated the needs of the masses in the fertilizer supply work, mistakenly believing that in this low-lying area, the masses have neither money nor the habit of applying fertilizer, and even during the topdressing season, not much fertilizer would be sold. Therefore, they didn't even have a fertilizer supply plan and instead requested more from the cooperative after they sold out, resulting in a serious fertilizer stockout.

    II. The leading cadres of the primary-level cooperatives lack a high sense of responsibility. For example, regarding the soybean cake supply issue at the Shenguantun distribution store, the leaders of the town cooperative had long known that the soybean cake inventory was insufficient and that the source of soybean cake was scarce, but they did not promptly think of ways to purchase cottonseed cake as a substitute. Although a batch was purchased in the end, some staff members locked the cottonseed cake in the warehouse because they were afraid of trouble, resulting in a situation where fertilizer was both out of stock and overstocked.

    III. Due to the serious conservative thinking of the cadres, the fertilizer supply plan was divorced from reality and could not meet the objective development requirements. For example, when the Hongqiao Cooperative was making the fertilizer supply plan, it ignored the improvement of the masses' ideological awareness and purchasing power, mistakenly estimating the amount of fertilizer needed this year based on the figure of just over 130,000 jin of fertilizer supplied last year. As a result, they only planned for 100,000 jin when making the topdressing plan in June, and the fertilizer prepared for one month was sold out in just twenty-seven days.

    Currently, it is the topdressing season. It is hoped that cooperatives in various regions will learn from the lessons of fertilizer stockouts in the primary-level cooperatives under the Yutian County Cooperative Union, do a good job in fertilizer supply, and ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops.

### 各地合作社应做好供肥工作  严防肥料脱销现象发生

专栏：读者来信摘要

    各地合作社应做好供肥工作
    严防肥料脱销现象发生
    河北省玉田县合作社联合社李卓云来信：玉田县合作社联合社在最近检查各基层社供应肥料工作中，先后发现三个基层社的五个分销店和一个门市部发生了肥料脱销现象。其中石旧窝社的孟大庄与徐家胡同分销店，因事先没有准备，只存化学肥料二、三千斤，雨后两天，这批化学肥料就被群众抢购一空，致停售一天，少供化学肥料六、七百斤。虹桥社的两个分销店和一个门市部也因化学肥料不足，停售半天，少供化学肥料五千多斤。特别是该社的门市部，正在集期的那天（六月二十七日），只卖到十二点钟就供应不上了，群众纷纷反映：合作社不是为生产服务吗？为什么群众要追肥时，不准备足够的肥料呢？这不是影响了生产吗？
    据检查结果，造成肥料脱销的原因是：
    一、基层社对分销店缺乏思想领导，形成供肥工作中的自流现象。如石旧窝社的孟大庄与徐家胡同分销店，在供肥工作中对群众的需要估计不足，错误地认为在这个水洼地，群众施肥一没有钱，二没有习惯，就是到了追肥季节，也卖不了多少，因此，连个供肥计划都没有，而是卖完了再向社里要，致造成肥料严重脱销现象。
    二、基层社的领导干部缺乏高度的责任心。如沈官屯分销店的豆饼供应问题，城镇社领导方面早就知道豆饼的存量不足，并知道豆饼货源缺少，但并没有及时想办法购进棉仁饼来代替。最后虽然购进了一批，但因领导干部没有很好教育工作人员和及时检查工作，一些工作人员竟因为怕麻烦而将棉仁饼锁在仓库里，造成肥料一面脱销而一面积压的现象。
    三、由于干部存在严重的保守思想，致使供肥计划脱离了实际，不能满足客观的发展要求。如虹桥社在做供肥计划时，忽视了群众思想觉悟和购买力的提高，错误地按照去年只供肥十三万多斤的数字估计今年所需肥料，因而在六月份做追肥计划时只做十万斤，结果准备一个月卖的肥料只二十七天就卖光了。
    目前，正是追肥季节，希望各地合作社记取玉田县联社所属各基层社肥料脱销的教训，做好肥料供应工作，以保证大秋作物丰产。
