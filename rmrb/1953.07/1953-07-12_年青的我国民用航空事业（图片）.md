In our vast country, the expansion of civil aviation can greatly shorten the distances between regions in terms of transportation. Now, major cities such as Beijing, Xi'an, Wuhan, Chongqing, Kunming, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanning, and Zhanjiang are directly connected by scheduled flights.

China's civil aviation serves the people. The majority of passengers are national construction workers, and the air cargo consists mainly of industrial equipment, agricultural seeds, medical instruments, newspapers, magazines, and daily necessities closely related to national construction and people's lives, playing a significant role in national construction and promoting cultural exchange. China's civil aviation also undertakes tasks such as forest protection, aerial surveying, and locust control, which are of great importance to China's forestry construction and agricultural production.

    Before each flight, mechanical personnel carefully inspect all the aircraft's components to ensure flight safety.

    Before each flight, the captain convenes a flight crew meeting to discuss matters to be noted during the flight.

    在幅圆广大的我国，由于民用航空事业的扩展，在交通运输方面就可以大大地缩短了地区间的距离。现在北京、西安、武汉、重庆、昆明、上海、广州、南宁和湛江等主要城市，都由定期飞机保持着直接的交通联系。
    我国的民用航空事业是为人民服务的。大部分乘客都是国家建设工作人员，空运物资也都是与国家建设和人民生活有着密切关系的工业器材、农业种籽、医药器械、书报和日用品等，对于国家建设和促进文化交流起了很大的作用。我国民用航空事业还担任了护林、航空测量和灭蝗等工作，对于我国的林业建设和农业生产也有着极重大的意义。    （本期画刊照片除署名者外均为人民画报郑光华摄）
