    Our Great Motherland
    The project of Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River, the largest reservoir in terms of volume in our country, has been fully completed before the flood season.

This is a panoramic view of the three main projects of the Guanting Reservoir: the dam, the water diversion tunnel, and the spillway.
