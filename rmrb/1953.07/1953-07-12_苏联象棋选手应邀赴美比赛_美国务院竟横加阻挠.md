Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: TASS Moscow, July 7th dispatch: At the request of the U.S. Chess Federation, the President of the International Chess Federation, Folke Rogard, suggested to the Soviet Chess Federation that a Soviet-American chess match be held in New York in July.

    The Soviet Chess Federation accepted the invitation. On July 6th, the Soviet chess team departed from Moscow by plane for New York. The chess team includes Grandmasters Botvinnik, Keres, Smyslov, Boleslavsky, Kotov, Geller, Taimanov, Tolush, and reserve players Petrosian and Averbakh. The head of the Soviet delegation is Kemanov; the captain of the chess team is Grandmaster Ragozin, and the coach is Grandmaster Bondarevsky.

    The Soviet and American chess teams will compete in four rounds, with each participant playing four games. The first round is scheduled to begin on July 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: TASS Moscow, July 9th dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the chess match between the Soviet Union and the United States is scheduled to be held in New York on July 15th this year.

    The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky, made a statement to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, O'Shaughnessy, on July 8th regarding this matter.

    The statement said: The U.S. Chess Federation formally invited the Soviet Chess Federation to hold a chess match with the U.S. Chess Federation in July this year.

    However, when the U.S. Embassy issued U.S. entry visas to the Soviet chess players, it claimed, under the instruction of the U.S. State Department, that the issuance of entry visas was conditional: Soviet chess players were only allowed to stay within the city limits of New York City and were not allowed to leave New York City.

    In subsequent negotiations between the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union on this issue, it was learned that the restriction prohibiting members of the Soviet chess team from leaving New York City also extended to whether the players could travel to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations' villa in Glen Cove, about twelve miles from New York City, which was allocated to the Soviet chess players for normal rest during the competition.

    On July 7th, after the Soviet chess players had left the Soviet Union en route to the United States, the Embassy notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the State Department had issued a negative response to the question of whether the Soviet chess players could leave New York City to go to the Soviet Mission villa in Glen Cove.

    The measure of depriving the Soviet chess players of the right to go to Glen Cove will place their stay in the United States for the purpose of participating in the chess match in an abnormal state; this does not conform to the basic requirements of international etiquette that should be accorded to Soviet chess players who are invited to the United States, and is completely unacceptable to the Soviet chess players.

    The statement concluded: The Soviet Chess Federation and the Soviet chess players believe that unless the aforementioned conditions regarding the stay of the Soviet chess players in the United States are modified, they will not be able to participate in the chess match.

    苏联象棋选手应邀赴美比赛
    美国务院竟横加阻挠
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：国际象棋联合会主席弗·罗加德应美国象棋联合会之请，向苏联象棋联合会建议于七月间在纽约举行苏美象棋比赛。
    苏联象棋联合会接受了邀请。七月六日苏联象棋队已由莫斯科乘飞机赴纽约。象棋队包括特级象棋大师波特维尼克、凯列斯、斯米斯洛夫、鲍列夫拉夫斯基、科托夫、盖列尔、塔伊曼诺夫、托卢希和后备棋手彼得罗斯扬、阿维巴赫等人。苏联代表团团长是凯曼诺夫；象棋队队长是特级象棋大师拉戈辛，教练是特级象棋大师波邦达列夫斯基。
    苏联和美国象棋队的比赛将分四轮，每一参加者走四盘棋，第一轮定于七月十五日举行。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：据报纸消息：苏联与美国的象棋比赛订于今年七月十五日在纽约举行。
    苏联外交部副部长安·扬·维辛斯基于七月八日就这件事向美国驻苏联临时代办奥绍尼西发表了声明。
    声明说：美国象棋联合会正式邀请苏联象棋联合会与美国象棋联合会在今年七月举行象棋比赛。
    但是美国大使馆在发美国入境签证给苏联象棋选手时却奉美国国务院的指示声称发给入境签证有一个条件，就是：苏联象棋选手只许停留在纽约市内，不得离开纽约市境。
    在随后苏联外交部与美国驻苏联大使馆就这个问题举行的谈判中，又得知禁止苏联象棋队队员离开纽约市的规定，还涉及选手们是否可以前往离纽约市约十二哩的格林克夫镇苏联驻联合国代表团的别墅的问题，而这个别墅是拨给苏联棋手们在比赛期间作正常休息之用的。
    七月七日，在苏联象棋选手已离开苏联首途赴美国后，大使馆通知外交部说：国务院对苏联象棋选手是否可以离开纽约市到格林克夫苏联代表团别墅的问题作了否定的答复。
    剥夺苏联象棋选手前往格林克夫的权利的措施将使他们为参加象棋比赛而在美国的停留处于一种不正常的状态；这是不符合于对应邀到美国去的苏联棋手应有的国际礼貌的起码要求的，并且是苏联棋手们完全不能接受的。
    声明最后说：苏联象棋联合会与苏联棋手们认为除非把上述关于苏联棋手在美国停留的条件加以修改，否则他们将不能参加象棋比赛。
