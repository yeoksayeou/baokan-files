The Fengfeng Mining Bureau Geological Exploration Office establishes responsibility system; completely overfulfills drilling tasks in June.

    The Fengfeng Mining Bureau Geological Exploration Office, in the past due to a lack of scientific management systems, was in a backward state of low quality, low efficiency, many accidents, and high costs for a long time. From January to May of this year, there were a total of 252 accidents of all sizes, occupying 37% of the total working time. Because there was no clear division of labor in the work, the drilling site operations were chaotic. Some machine operators did not know their responsibilities, some apprentices did not know what they should do when they went to work, some drilling equipment was idle, and some drilling rigs were waiting for this type of equipment but could not find it. The material supply work was even worse. The required materials were not available, resulting in work stoppages waiting for materials; a large amount of unnecessary materials were stockpiled, and the total value of the stockpiled equipment exposed during the anti-waste campaign amounted to over 1 billion yuan. The backwardness of geological work also affected the drilling work. A drilling rig often had to be changed several times from moving to starting drilling.

    In order to completely reverse this situation, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau Geological Exploration Office carried out an anti-waste, anti-no-one-in-charge, and establishment of responsibility system campaign in June. By exposing past waste and no-one-in-charge phenomena, and by carefully calculating accounts, the workers recognized the harm of not having a responsibility system and the necessity of establishing one. On this basis, they formulated various special responsibility systems, and began to achieve "everything is managed by someone, and everyone has a specific job", initially correcting the chaotic situation in the work and thoroughly changing the backward state of geological drilling work. In June, the drilling tasks were comprehensively overfulfilled (completing 117% of the planned figures), and the core extraction rate reached almost 80% (the state requires 75%). The morale of the employees was high, and laughter filled the air. The workers said: "June is the month when our drilling work underwent a complete transformation. It is the first time for Fengfeng drilling work to comprehensively complete the production tasks. This is the beginning of our victory." (Wang Yunfei)

    峰峰矿务局地质勘察处建立责任制度
    六月份全面超额完成钻探任务
    峰峰矿务局地质勘察处，过去由于缺乏科学的管理制度，工作长期陷于质量低、效率低、事故多、成本高的落后状况。今年一月份至五月份共出大小事故二百五十二次，占用时间占总工作时间的百分之三十七。因为工作中没有明确的分工，造成钻场操作混乱，有的机长不知道自己的职责，有的徒工上了班还不知自己应干点啥，有的钻机器材闲着，有的钻机却等着这类器材用而找不到。材料供应工作更差，需用的材料没有，造成停工待料；不需用的材料则大批积压，反浪费运动中揭发出来的积压器材的总值达十亿元之多。地质工作的落后也影响了钻探工作，一个钻机从搬家到开钻，往往要更改几次。
    峰峰矿务局地质勘察处为了彻底扭转这种局面，在六月份开展了反浪费反无人负责建立责任制运动，通过揭发过去的浪费及无人负责现象，又通过算细账的方式使工人们认清了没有责任制的危害和建立责任制的必要。在这一基础上，他们制定了各种专责制，开始做到了“事事有人管，人人有专职”，初步纠正了工作中的纷乱状况。彻底改变了地质钻探工作的落后状态。六月份全面地超额完成了钻探任务（完成计划数字的百分之一百十七），岩心提取率达百分之八十弱（国家要求百分之七十五）。职工情绪饱满，到处充满了胜利的笑声，工人们说：“六月份是我们钻探工作改头换面的一个月，全面地完成生产任务在峰峰钻探工作来说还是头一回，这是我们胜利的开始。”（王云飞）
