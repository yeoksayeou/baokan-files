Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 30th: Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Vice Foreign Minister Li Dong-gun sent reply telegrams on July 29th to Chairman G.M. Malenkov of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov respectively.

    Premier Kim Il-sung's Reply Telegram to Chairman Malenkov
    To Comrade Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Moscow:

    On behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people, I extend my heartfelt and profound gratitude to you, dear Chairman, and through you to the Soviet government and the entire Soviet people, for the warm congratulations from the government of the Soviet Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and yourself on the historic victory achieved by the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War of bloodshed provoked by the American aggressors against the Korean people.

    I am convinced that the enormous and selfless assistance and support given by the Soviet Union to the Korean people is one of the important factors for the Korean people to achieve victory in the three-year arduous war against American imperialist aggression and in defense of the freedom and independence of their motherland; at the same time, it is a reliable guarantee for the Korean people to successfully complete the important tasks facing them after the armistice—completing the unification of the motherland and rapidly restoring the national economy destroyed by the war.

    The Soviet government's stated intention to provide various assistance to the Korean people who are embarking on the cause of reunification and peaceful construction of their motherland further inspires our Korean people to advance towards victory and strengthens our confidence and courage in pursuing our sacred and great cause.

    Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    July 29, 1953, Pyongyang

    Vice Foreign Minister Li Dong-gun's Reply Telegram to Minister Molotov
    To Comrade Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Moscow:

    I extend my deep gratitude for the warm congratulations you have given on the signing of the armistice agreement in the Korean War provoked by the American imperialist armed aggressors.

    During the war, the active support and solidarity of the great Soviet Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the fraternal people's democratic countries gave the Korean people unwavering confidence in victory and became a strong guarantee of our victory.

    With the signing of the armistice agreement in the Korean War, the active support and assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries to the Korean people, who are rising up to complete the great cause of peaceful reunification and independence of their motherland and to fight for the restoration and development of the post-war national economy, inspires the Korean people to move towards new and greater victories and strengthens the Korean people's confidence in victory.

    Li Dong-gun, Vice Foreign Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    July 29, 1953, Pyongyang
