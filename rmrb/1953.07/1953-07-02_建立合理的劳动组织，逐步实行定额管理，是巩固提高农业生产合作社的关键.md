    Establishing a Reasonable Labor Organization and Gradually Implementing Quota Management is Key to Consolidating and Improving Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Zhang Qingtai
    Based on the experience of trial agricultural production cooperatives in Northeast China last year, establishing a reasonable labor organization and gradually implementing quota management to achieve reasonable distribution is key to consolidating and improving agricultural production cooperatives. In the early spring of last year, due to a lack of experience in establishing cooperatives, the old methods of mutual aid teams were still followed for labor and work point recording, resulting in widespread phenomena such as loose organization, "working in a rush," "loafing on the job," and "dragging one's feet," which wasted labor and resulted in no one being responsible for production. After paying attention to establishing a labor organization suitable for agricultural production cooperatives and starting to implement quota management, the labor efficiency of production cooperatives greatly increased (according to inspections, generally by 20% to 30% compared to mutual aid teams), thus guaranteeing improved technology and increased output. According to statistics from ninety-one cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province, the average yield per hectare was 3,641 jin (standard grain), an increase of more than 20% compared to local mutual aid teams. After labor efficiency improved, the surplus labor was used to develop sideline production, further increasing the income of cooperative members. The sideline income of many production cooperatives was two or three times, or even five or six times, more than that of mutual aid teams. Some cooperatives also used surplus labor to improve the soil, build water conservancy projects, and plant trees, laying the foundation for further improving agricultural productivity.
    The Form of Labor Organization Should be Determined According to the Actual Needs of the Cooperative
    According to the experience of various regions, the form of labor organization must be determined according to the specific conditions of the size of the agricultural production cooperative, the different content of production, and other factors. It can be roughly divided into the following types:
    (1) Permanent fixed grouping (teams) – Based on the specific conditions of the total land area, management scale, labor, livestock, and production tools of the cooperative, all labor and leading personnel within the cooperative are organized into several fixed production groups (or teams). Each group is rationally divided according to the members' strengths and has a fixed group leader. The size and number of groups should be adapted to a certain number of production tools. Vehicles, horses, and farm tools are all allocated to the groups. In this way, a certain production plan and task can be assigned to each group, so that each group can carry out continuous operations from spring plowing preparation to autumn harvest and even the production preparation for the following year. The use and management of vehicles, horses, and farm tools are also subject to a permanent responsibility system. Within the production group, some tasks can also adopt a personal responsibility system, such as managing crops, driving vehicles, feeding horses, and managing and using certain farm tools.
    Permanent fixed grouping requires the permanent fixed division of cultivated areas. The division of cultivated areas should be based on the principle of maintaining centralized and contiguous operation. This is even more necessary under the conditions of using new agricultural tools. Some areas emphasize the convenience of comparison and competition between groups and adopt the method of simply dividing cultivated areas equally according to crop types or land quantity and quality, making the land more fragmented and dispersed. This method is inappropriate. The advantage of permanent fixed grouping is that it is easy for leaders to grasp, it is suitable for implementing permanent contract work and output quota systems in production, and it is easy to improve production technology and give play to labor enthusiasm. According to the current situation, this organizational form is suitable for key promotion in agricultural production cooperatives with a larger scale (generally around 30 households, more than 100 hectares of land), more labor (generally around 30 laborers), and stronger leadership.
    (2) Seasonal labor organization – According to the specific conditions of the strength and weakness of the cooperative's labor force, the level of technology, and the vehicles, horses, and farm tools, appropriate combinations are made. According to the production needs of each season, short-term seasonal production teams are formed. Each group is responsible for a certain production task or operation in a certain section of land in a certain season. For example, in the summer weeding season, groups are divided according to land sections or crops, or groups are divided according to operations such as weeding, hoeing, and cultivating. Within a season, the members and leaders of the team remain basically unchanged. The characteristic of this organizational form is that it is relatively flexible and can adapt to the production needs of each season, give play to labor enthusiasm, and overcome the phenomenon of "working in a rush" and wasting labor. It can be widely used in cooperatives with a certain scale (generally around 20 households).
    (3) Temporary grouping – Usually, there is no grouping. According to work needs, a temporary allocation of labor is adopted, and cooperative members are temporarily organized into teams. Each group is responsible according to the division of labor in the overall plan of the cooperative and completes a certain task within a certain period. This organizational form can be adopted in cooperatives with a smaller scale (generally around 10 households), less labor, and inconvenient fixed grouping by season.
    (4) Regarding the organization of female labor. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions mostly flexibly organize female labor according to specific conditions and production needs. In cooperatives that adopt a permanent fixed labor organization form, women's teams should be grouped and fixed together with men's teams, because at present, women generally cannot be solely responsible for a cultivated area. Some cooperatives that are grouped by season also adopt mixed grouping of men and women. Mixed grouping can meet the needs of various operations and is conducive to improving women's production technology and production enthusiasm. In the case of mixed grouping, labor can also be used flexibly according to specific operations. For example, men and women are together when hoeing, and women are grouped separately when weeding seedlings.
    One year of experience has proved that regardless of what form of labor organization is adopted, it must be based on the specific situation and production needs of each cooperative, decided by the members through democratic discussion, and be good at closely combining the division of labor and work with the unified allocation of labor.
    The Formulation of Work Quotas Should be Based on the Habits of the Masses
    After the labor organization is established, gradually implementing quota management in production and distributing the results of labor according to the principle of "to each according to his work" can guarantee that the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members is fully utilized. Agricultural production cooperatives in Northeast China mostly use the labor day as the unit for calculating labor, gradually formulate work quotas, and implement a piece-rate system.
    The labor day is determined based on the quantity and quality of each cooperative member's labor. At present, the calculation of labor days in various regions is mostly based on the work quotas that the masses are accustomed to, such as how much work is required for sowing, hoeing, or harvesting different crops. Due to different farming conditions and different habits of the masses in various regions, the content of labor days in each cooperative should not be forced to be the same. In some areas, the masses do not distinguish between seasons, but determine labor days according to the type and nature of the operation and based on the work quotas that they are accustomed to. In some areas, the masses pay attention to seasonal differences, taking one day of hoeing as one labor day, and all operations during autumn harvest and spring plowing are based on the hoeing work as a standard, stipulating a certain conversion ratio, and determining labor days according to this ratio. When determining labor days, the standard is mostly based on medium-strength labor, which has a positive effect on improving labor efficiency.
    There are two methods for evaluating the specific labor days of each cooperative member: one is to democratically evaluate each person's labor performance and work effect after completing a task by the team. The other is to have a fixed score and a flexible evaluation, that is, to first set a fixed score based on each person's labor strength and technical level, and then make a flexible evaluation based on actual performance and work effect, and increase or decrease it as appropriate.
    Gradually improving and streamlining the work quotas that the masses are accustomed to is the direction of our future efforts. The Han En Cooperative in Jilin has begun to divide quotas into three levels according to the different degrees of labor, complexity, and technical requirements of various operations: a second-level operation is one labor day, a first-level operation is 1.2 labor days, and a third-level operation is 0.8 labor days. This can be tested as a priority. However, the trial implementation of work quotas should currently be based on the principle of simplicity and ease of implementation; being too complicated will not work.
    With work quotas, a collective piece-rate system, commonly known as contract work, can be implemented. Some cooperatives put forward requirements for fixed quality, quantity, and time for a certain land area, or a certain crop, or a certain operation in a season, reasonably evaluate the number of labor days, and contract it to a certain production team to complete. The labor days saved by improving labor efficiency are used as an excess reward for the team. After each piece of work is completed, the team should carefully do a good job of individual scoring. This method is flexible and easy to implement and can be widely promoted for trial implementation in agricultural production cooperatives in various regions.
    With work quotas, implementing a personal piece-rate system is even more effective. The personal piece-rate system evaluates the work quota and pays according to the number of pieces completed by individuals. At present, it is generally applicable to operations that are easy to calculate on an individual basis, such as picking manure, tilling stubble, thinning seedlings, cutting large fields, peeling corn, digging sorghum, picking cotton, and collecting firewood. Its advantage is that it can better implement the principle of "to each according to his work" and "equal pay for equal work," and encourage women and semi-laborers to participate in production extensively. When implementing it, appropriate quota standards must be set. Being too high or too low will affect the implementation of quota management. At the same time, the quota should be increased at regular intervals with the improvement of labor efficiency; and an inspection system should be established to continuously carry out quality inspection, because the phenomenon of greed for more and faster is very easy to occur after the implementation of contract work and piece-rate work.
    With work quotas, the cooperative can implement an excess reward system according to specific conditions. If the agricultural or sideline production exceeds the production plan, a certain amount can be extracted from the excess part and awarded to the cooperative members or teams engaged in this production. It is also possible to contract work according to the number of labor days required for a certain work as budgeted by the production plan. If cooperative members and team members complete the task in excess due to production efforts or the creation of advanced production methods, they will still be given the budgeted number of labor days, and the labor days saved will be used as a reward. At the same time, the reward method of "adding a certain percentage to the member's labor days or work points if the excess is a certain percentage" can also be gradually implemented, which can continuously improve labor efficiency and agricultural productivity.
    One year of experience has proved that gradually implementing quota management has great benefits for production: First, it can implement a responsibility system, overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and ensure that the cooperative carries out production in an organized and planned manner. Second, cooperative members can teach and learn from each other, overcome conservative and backward thinking, improve labor enthusiasm and creativity, give play to labor efficiency, and continuously improve farming techniques, ensuring the completion and over-completion of production tasks. As the masses in various regions have reflected: fixed points are only a retreat, not an advance; while contract work and piecework are only an advance, not a retreat. Third, it can carry out competitions, so that the collective interests of the cooperative and the individual interests of the cooperative members are closely linked. As the masses in various regions have also reflected: if you have the ability to do more work and improve the quality, not only will you get more work points, but if the whole cooperative's land is taken care of well and more grain is harvested, everyone will have a share.
    Organizational Leadership and Ideological Leadership Must be Strengthened
    In order to ensure that the labor organization of the agricultural production cooperative is effectively established and consolidated, and that the quota management system is conscientiously adhered to, organizational leadership and ideological leadership must be strengthened.
    In terms of organizational leadership: First of all, the planning of operations must be strengthened. This is an important condition for establishing and improving the labor organization and implementing quota management. The production cooperative should formulate annual, seasonal, and stage-by-stage operation plans according to the production plan, so as to allocate labor organizations, contract work, and determine quota standards based on the plan through democratic discussion of the members. Some cooperatives have adopted the method of signing contracts between the cooperative and the team. The cooperative is responsible for supplying the means of production, and the team guarantees to work on time and complete the task. The labor self-reporting system of the Jin Shilong Cooperative is based on the production team as a unit. According to the cooperative's production plan and operation plan, land conditions, technical measures, etc., through careful calculation, the number of labor days required for each team in each season of spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest is determined. Finally, the members report the number of work days in each period, and after democratic evaluation, a specific operation plan with fixed time, quantity, and quality for the whole team is formulated. This not only facilitates the adjustment of labor between teams, but also specifically implements the overall plan of the cooperative on each cooperative member, and can give full play to individual technical strengths and production responsibility.
    Secondly, the number of labor days used for various production activities and the number of labor days of each cooperative member should be recorded by day and by category. Some cooperatives use cooperative member labor manuals or labor cards, and the team leader registers the number of labor days every day, submits them to the accountant for recording work accounts, and then keeps them by the cooperative members themselves for reference. Some cooperatives also implement a work ticket system, issuing work tickets according to the number of labor day points for each cooperative member every day. Both of these methods facilitate the accurate calculation and summary of labor days. In addition, the democratic formulation of labor discipline that everyone abides by, the development of labor competitions, and the encouragement of cooperative members to put forward rationalization proposals are all issues that should be paid attention to and resolved in consolidating labor organizations and implementing quota management.
    In terms of ideological leadership, ideological education must be continuously carried out and various concerns of cooperative members must be resolved in a timely manner. The main ideological obstacles encountered by agricultural production cooperatives in various regions when promoting contract quotas are: the good laborers initially do not believe it, fearing that the regulations will not work, or will not be counted, and will be in vain; the poor laborers passively resist; the general laborers think that "contract work or no contract work is the same, anyway, the meat is rotten in the pot," and express indifference; committee members and team leaders are afraid of trouble and afraid of offending people. Before implementing the contract work system, the Yushu He Fengshan Cooperative first conducted more than ten days of brewing and discussion in the party, league, activists, and council meetings, launched criticism and self-criticism, and conducted a small contract work experiment by key members and women before the contract work system was initially determined. In order to dispel the concerns of cooperative members who feared that "doing more work would be in vain," some agricultural production cooperatives first issued work tickets to the team leader according to the number of contract work, and issued work tickets to cooperative members according to the number of work days on the same day, which the cooperative members were very satisfied with.
    Two Deviations That Must Be Prevented
    At present, there are two deviations in the establishment of labor organizations and the implementation of quota management in agricultural production cooperatives: one is that, without taking into account the specific conditions, without asking about the acceptance of the masses, and without considering the necessity and possibility, they attempt to set up a complete and advanced labor organization at once and implement strict quota management. This is a manifestation of hasty and rash emotions in labor organization. The result is formalism. The other is that they do not realize that a more advanced production organization like an agricultural production cooperative must have a labor organization form and quota management method that are compatible with it. Therefore, they take a laissez-faire attitude towards the work of establishing a labor organization and implementing quota management, resulting in the failure to give play to the advantages of the agricultural production cooperative. Both of these deviations must be paid attention to and overcome.

    建立合理的劳动组织，逐步实行定额管理，是巩固提高农业生产合作社的关键
    本报特约记者　张庆泰
    根据东北地区去年一年试办农业生产合作社的经验，建立合理的劳动组织、逐步实行定额管理以实现合理的分配，是巩固提高农业生产合作社的关键。去年春初，各地因办社没有经验，仍然因袭互助组的一套办法来进行劳动和评工记分，结果普遍产生组织松懈、“干活一窝蜂”、“混日头”、“磨洋工”等浪费劳动力及生产无人负责的现象。在注意建立适合农业生产合作社的劳动组织和开始实行定额管理以后，各地生产合作社的劳动效率大大提高（根据检查，一般的比互助组提高百分之二十到三十），因而保证了改进技术、增加产量。据黑龙江省九十一个社统计，每垧平均产量三千六百四十一斤（标准粮），比当地互助组提高百分之二十以上。劳动效率提高以后，剩余的劳力用于发展副业生产，更增加了社员的收入。许多生产合作社的副业收入比互助组多两、三倍甚至五、六倍。有些社并利用剩余劳力改良土壤、兴修水利、植树造林等农业建设，为进一步提高农业生产力打下了基础。
    劳动组织形式要根据社的实际需要来确定
    根据各地经验，劳动组织的形式必须根据农业生产合作社的规模大小、生产内容的不同等具体条件而定，大体可分为下列几种：
    （1）常年固定编组（队）——根据全社土地数量、经营规模、劳力畜力及生产工具等具体情况，将社内所有劳力和领导骨干，编成若干固定的生产组（或队）。每组按照组员特长进行合理分工，有固定的组长。分组大小、多少，和一定的生产工具相适应。车马和农具都按组分配。这样，即可按组规定一定的生产计划和任务，使各组从春耕准备直到秋收以至第二年的生产准备，进行连续性的作业。车马农具的使用、保管也实行常年负责制。在生产组内，有些工作并可采取个人负责制，如管理农作物、赶车、喂马、管理和使用一定的农具等。
    要常年固定编组，就要求常年固定划分耕作区。耕作区的划分，应以保持集中和连片经营为原则。在使用新农具的条件下更需要如此。某些地区强调便于组与组间的对比竞赛，而采取单纯按作物种类平分或按土地数量质量平分的办法划分耕作区，使土地更加割裂、分散。这种办法是不适当的。常年固定编组的好处是领导上便于掌握，在生产上宜于实行常年包工和产量定额制，便于提高生产技术，发挥劳动积极性。根据目前情况，这种组织形式适合在规模较大（一般在三十户左右，土地百垧以上）、劳力较多（一般有三十个左右劳力）、领导骨干较强的农业生产合作社重点推行。
    （2）季节性的劳动组织——根据全社劳力强弱、技术高低及车马农具的具体情况作适当搭配，按照各个季节的生产需要，编成短期的季节的生产小组。每组负责一个季节某一地段的生产任务或某项作业。如夏锄季节，按地段或作物分成若干组，或按薅草、铲地、趟地等作业分组。在一个季节内，小组成员和组长基本不变。这种组织形式的特点是比较机动灵活，可以适应每个季节的生产需要，发挥劳动积极性，克服干活“一窝蜂”和浪费劳力的现象；在具有一定规模（一般在二十户左右）的社，可以广泛采用。
    （3）临时分组——平时不分组，根据工作需要，采用临时拨工办法，把社员临时编成小组。各组按照全社计划分工负责，在一定时期内完成一定任务。这种组织形式在规模较小（一般在十户左右）、劳力较少、不便于按季节固定分组的社都可采用。
    （4）关于妇女劳力的组织。各地农业生产合作社对于妇女劳力，多根据具体情况和生产需要灵活编组。在采用常年固定劳动组织形式的社，妇女小组应随男子组编组并固定起来，因为在目前一般妇女不能单独负责一个耕作区。有些按季节编组的社，也有采取男女混合编组的。混合编组可配合各项作业的需要，便于提高妇女的生产技术和生产积极性。在混合编组的情况下，亦可根据具体作业，灵活运用劳力。如铲地时男女在一起，薅苗时妇女又单独编组。
    一年来的经验证明，无论采取何种劳动组织形式，都必须从每个合作社的具体情况和生产需要出发，由社员民主讨论决定，并要善于把分工分业与劳力统一调配紧密结合起来。
    制订工作定额要以群众的习惯为依据
    劳动组织建立以后，在生产上逐步实行定额管理、按劳取酬的原则分配劳动的成果，才能保证充分发挥社员的劳动积极性。东北各地的农业生产合作社大都以劳动日为计算劳动的单位，逐步制定工作定额，实行计件制。
    劳动日是根据每个社员劳动的量与质而定的。目前各地计算劳动日多是以群众习惯上的工作定额为依据，如播种、铲趟或收割不同作物各需要多少工等。由于各地耕作条件不同、群众习惯不同，各社劳动日的内容，不应强求一致。有的地区群众不分季节，而是按作业的种类和性质，并根据习惯上的工作定额来确定劳动日。有的地区群众重视季节性的差别，以一个铲地工为一个劳动日，秋收春耕时的各项作业均以铲地工为标准，规定出一定的折合比例，按照这比例来确定劳动日。在确定劳动日时，多以上中等劳动力为标准，这样就具有提高劳动效率的积极作用。
    每个社员的具体劳动日的评定，有两种方法：一种是在完成一件工作之后，根据每人的劳动表现和工作效果，由小组民主评定。另一种是死分活评，即根据每人劳力强弱、技术高低，先定出死分，然后按照实际表现、工作效果，进行活评，酌予增减。
    把群众习惯上的工作定额，逐步加以提高使之条理化，是我们今后努力的方向。吉林韩恩社已开始根据各种作业的轻重、繁简和技术要求高低的不同，分为三级定额：二级作业为一个劳动日，一级作业为一点二个劳动日，三级作业为零点八个劳动日。这是可以重点试行的。但目前试行工作定额应以简而易行为原则，过于繁琐就会行不通。
    有了工作定额，就可以实行集体计件制，即通常所说的包工。有些合作社在一个季节中，对一定的土地面积，或某种作物、某项作业，提出定质、定量、定时的要求，合理评出劳动日数，包给某一生产小组完成。因提高劳动效率所节省的劳动日，即做为对小组的超额奖励。在每件工作完成之后，组内再认真做好个人评分。这种办法灵活易行，可以广泛提倡在各地农业生产合作社内试行。
    有了工作定额，实行个人计件制就更为有效。个人计件制是把工作评出定额，按个人完成的件数计工取酬。目前一般适用于拣粪、打茬子、间苗、割大田、扒苞米、掏高粱、摘棉花、打柴等容易按个人计算的作业。它的好处是更能贯彻按劳取酬与同工同酬的原则，鼓励妇女、半劳力广泛参加生产。在实行时，必须适当规定定额标准，过高过低都会影响到定额管理的贯彻实行。同时还须随着劳动效率的提高，在一定时期提高定额；并应建立检查制度，不断进行质量检查，因为在实行包工计件之后，贪多图快的现象极易发生。
    有了工作定额，合作社就可以根据具体条件，实行超额奖励制度。凡农业副业超过生产计划的，可从超额部分抽出一定数量，奖给从事这项生产的社员或小组。也可以按生产计划预算某种工作所需劳动日数进行包工。社员和小组人员因为生产努力，或创造了先进的生产方法而超额完成任务的，仍照给预算的劳动日数，其少用的劳动日数即作为奖励。同时，也可以逐步地实行“超额百分之几就在社员的劳动日或工数上附加百分之几”的奖励办法，这样更可不断地提高劳动效率和农业生产力。
    一年来的经验证明，逐步实行定额管理，对生产的好处很大：第一、可以贯彻责任制，克服无人负责现象，保证合作社有组织有计划地进行生产。第二、社员间可以互教互学，克服保守落后思想，提高劳动积极性和创造性，发挥劳动效率，不断改进耕作技术，保证生产任务完成和超额完成。正如各地群众反映的：定死分是只有后退，不会前进；而包工计件，是只有前进，不会后退的。第三、可以开展竞赛，使合作社的集体利益和社员个人利益紧密地结合起来。也正如各地群众反映的：你有能力多干活并把质量提高，不但你自己多得工分，全社的地侍弄好了，粮打多了，大家都有一份儿。
    必须加强组织领导和思想领导
    为使农业生产合作社的劳动组织切实地建立并巩固起来，把定额管理制度认真地坚持下去，必须加强组织领导与思想领导。
    在组织领导方面：首先必须加强作业计划性，这是建立与健全劳动组织实行定额管理的重要条件。生产合作社应根据生产计划，分别制订全年的、季节的和每个阶段的作业计划，以便根据计划，通过社员民主讨论，调配劳动组织，进行包工和确定定额标准。有些社采取了社和小组订合同的办法，社里负责供应生产资料，小组保证按时出工，完成任务。金时龙社的劳动自报制，就是以生产组为单位，根据全社生产计划和作业计划、土地条件、技术措施等，通过精打细算，订出各组的春耕、夏锄、秋收各个季节所需的劳动日数，最后由社员自报在每个时期的出工数，经过民主评议，订出全组的定时、定量、定质的具体作业计划。这样不仅便于调剂组与组间的劳动力，而且把全社的计划具体贯彻到每个社员身上，可以充分发挥个人的技术特长和生产责任心。
    其次，要按日分类记载全社用于各种生产活动的劳动日数和每个社员的劳动日数。有些社采用了社员劳动手册或劳动卡片，每天由小组长登记劳动日数，交会计员记载工账后，由社员本人保管备查。也有些社实行工票制，按每个社员每天劳动日分数发给工票。这两种办法都便于精确计算和总结劳动日。此外，由社员民主制定大家共同遵守的劳动纪律，开展劳动竞赛，鼓励社员提合理化建议等，都是巩固劳动组织和实行定额管理所应当注意解决的问题。
    在思想领导方面，必须不断地进行思想教育，及时解除社员的各种顾虑。各地农业生产合作社在推行包工定额时碰到的主要思想障碍是：劳动好的开始不相信，怕规定了行不通，或说了不算，白费劲；劳动差的消极抵抗；一般的认为“包工不包工一样干，反正肉烂在锅里”，表示漠不关心；委员、组长怕麻烦、怕得罪人。榆树何凤山社在实行包工之前，先在党、团、积极分子、理事会上做了十几天的酝酿讨论，展开了批评和自我批评，并由骨干分子和妇女进行了一次小包工试验，才初步把包工制确定下来。有些农业生产合作社为了打消社员怕“多干活白搭”的思想顾虑，事先按包工数把工票发给组长，当天按工数发给工票，社员很满意。
    必须注意防止的两种偏向
    目前农业生产合作社在建立劳动组织和实行定额管理当中，有两种偏向：一种是不根据具体条件，不问群众的接受程度，不根据必要与可能，企图一下子就搞起一套完整的高级的劳动组织，实行严密的定额管理。这是急躁冒进情绪在劳动组织方面的表现。其结果是流于形式主义。另一种是没有认识到农业生产合作社这样较高级的生产组织，必须有与之相适应的劳动组织形式和定额管理办法，因而对于建立劳动组织实行定额管理工作采取放任自流的态度，结果使农业生产合作社的优越性不能发挥。这两种偏向都是必须注意加以克服的。
