Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 26th: The Third World Youth Congress opened on the 25th in Bucharest, the capital of Romania.

Bucharest warmly welcomed the youth representatives who have already arrived from more than eighty countries (delegations from some countries are still on their way). The city is adorned in festive attire, appearing, as the residents say, younger than usual. Every household displays the feelings and hopes of the Bucharest residents and the entire Romanian people in their struggle for peace and international peaceful cooperation. All buildings, streets, and squares are decorated with colorful flags, posters, slogans, and the emblems of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, and the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

Peace and Friendship – this slogan of the World Federation of Democratic Youth is vividly expressed in Bucharest's festive decorations. This phrase is the slogan of the World Youth Congress, which opened on July 25th.

Young men and women of various opinions, races, nationalities, and social backgrounds are participating in this congress, making it a truly grand gathering of young people who hope to maintain peace and their own rights.

Guests attending the opening ceremony of the congress included: Dr. Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic; Academician Con. Parhon; Ikuo Oyama; Elisa Branco; Mrs. Candelaria Rodriguez; and Emil Otto, representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, delivered a brief opening speech.

The congress unanimously adopted the following agenda:

Activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth since the Second World Youth Congress, and the tasks of youth in the struggle for peace and their rights. Traian Săvulescu, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Romanian People's Republic, delivered a congratulatory speech. He said that the Romanian people gladly welcome the representatives of the Third World Youth Congress. Săvulescu expressed his deep conviction that the ideas and feelings embodied in the slogan of peace and friendship, which brought the congress delegates to the Romanian People's Republic, would spread throughout the world. Today, mutual understanding and unity between people, countries, and nations are more important than ever.

The July 25th meeting was chaired by Renato Tesi (Italy), Bill Vihermet (Canada), and Solanke Drogende (Nigeria).

Jacques Denis, on behalf of the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, delivered a report on the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth since the Second World Youth Congress and the tasks of youth in the struggle for peace and their rights.

Jacques Denis said: The World Federation of Democratic Youth, which convened this congress, hopes that this congress will become a grand gathering of youth forces striving for peace and the rights of the rising generation. The World Federation of Democratic Youth believes that only in a spirit of mutual trust, only with everyone united, can the aspirations of youth be realized. Therefore, it issues a comradely appeal to all international, national, and local organizations, to all young men and women—regardless of their opinions, race, nationality, and social background—to actively participate in the preparation work of the congress and to participate in the congress. The World Federation of Democratic Youth, therefore, once again demonstrates its desire to promote mutual understanding among youth and cooperation with various youth organizations.

Today, we welcome here many friends who have not cooperated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth in the past. Everyone will have every opportunity to express the most important issues in his mind and participate in the work of making congress resolutions.

We must make resolutions that are beneficial to all of us because we will not discuss issues that divide us, but rather issues that unite us, issues that are of vital importance to us: the rights of youth; their desire for a perfect and happy life; their desire for peace and national independence of all peoples.

Jacques Denis pointed out: The World Federation of Democratic Youth, which unites seventy-seven million youths from eighty-eight countries, is the most representative international youth organization. He said: Only in a peaceful world where all peoples are friends can the ideals of youth—the ideals about their future, the ideals of gaining knowledge, the ideals of living a healthy, cultured, and free life in an independent motherland—become a reality.

But today, the hearts of millions of young men and women are not only filled with beautiful ideals but also filled with anxiety about tomorrow.

The suffering of youth caused by the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya is a tragic reality. Youth in many countries are worried about tomorrow.

Youth need work, but in many countries, there are millions of unemployed young men and women, some of whom have never had any job. Millions of youths only have part-time work. Millions of unemployed youth do not receive relief and wander around hungry, seeking a livelihood. In Japan alone, there are ten million unemployed people, of whom about fifty percent are youth. According to statistics published by the National Labor Exchange, there are more than 600,000 unemployed young men and women in Italy.

In many countries, youth are subjected to racial discrimination in addition to low wages. The injustice suffered by young women is particularly shocking; they are doubly discriminated against as young workers and female workers.

In the countryside, millions of youths have no land. They have to work as hired laborers, farming the land for others and barely maintaining their lives, or as tenant farmers, handing over most of their harvest to others.

For youth, education is very important. However, a large number of young people in many countries have no access to education. For example, in Italy, hundreds of thousands of young people (mostly in the south) cannot go to school, while there are nearly 100,000 unemployed teachers.

Youth need to live a healthy and happy life. However, millions of people live in conditions that are prone to disease and cannot afford medical treatment. Due to the low standard of living, the average life expectancy of Brazilians does not exceed twenty-seven years. Millions of youths live in slums.

In colonies and dependent countries, governments usually do not allocate funds for education and sports.

Jacques Denis said that youth need to live in free and independent homelands. But in many countries, democratic rights are violated. Many youth groups are persecuted and even declared illegal. Their leaders are thrown into prison for defending the interests of youth and are often killed. Their newspapers are censored, persecuted, and closed down. This often happens, for example, in Iraq, France, Turkey, the United States, West Germany, and many other countries.

Millions of young men and women do not have the right to raise their country's flag, and they do not have the right to speak and read in their country's language.

Fertile fields have been turned into military bases, and ominous bomb depots are everywhere near peaceful villages.

This is the answer that the younger generation receives for their ideals.

Why is this happening? Because in many countries, everything, including the fate of youth, is subject to the policy of preparing for a new war.

In these countries, youth are no longer regarded as the hope of mankind but as cheap slaves or cannon fodder in a future destructive war.

This is why so many factories are closing down, inflation and taxes are swallowing up most of the wages, and the demands of youth are not being met.

The situation is completely different in countries where most of the budget is used for peaceful construction—such as Romania, where we are gathered.

Youth see that there are two paths before them: one path leads to disaster and war, and the other is the bright road to peace, where every effort brings a better life and development.

The choice of youth is clear: they choose the path of struggling for happiness, for peace, and for independence.

Jacques Denis said that the characteristic of the international situation in the past few years is the irresistible development of the worldwide peace movement. This movement of people of all countries illustrates all the great changes that have taken place in the international situation.

This spring, youth paid close attention, with great hope, to the new efforts made to achieve a peaceful resolution of outstanding issues. Soviet politicians drew people's attention to the peaceful principles of Soviet foreign policy and expressed their deep conviction that no outstanding issues cannot be resolved through mutual consultation between the countries concerned. Youth saw the concrete actions repeatedly taken by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to end the Korean War.

Youth hate the South Korean dictator for arbitrarily and brutally violating the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, and hate the Nazis, supported by certain groups, for trying to create a new hotbed of war in Berlin. Youth believe that this proves that the reactionary forces want to prolong and expand the bloody war now underway and make the international situation even more tense.

The outcome of the Korean negotiations proves that the vigilance and calmness of peace fighters can shatter all provocations.

The recent Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council, convened under the slogan of hope and vigilance, decided to organize a huge mass movement to strive for negotiation and peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues. Under the slogan of hope and vigilance, youth unite to strengthen the struggle for peace and national independence to open up a bright future.

When talking about the struggle of youth for a better life and peace and their tasks in expanding the struggle, Jacques Denis emphasized that one of the main tasks is to unite the young generation who are struggling for the rights of youth, the happy life of youth, for peace and national independence. The unity of youth is one of the main conditions for their victory. He pointed out that there have been tremendous changes in the thinking of youth members of various organizations, in youth relations, and in the relations between youth organizations.

More and more young men and women, driven by the same desires and interests, unite, reach agreements, and take concerted action. Millions of young people know from their own experience that unity is possible, necessary, and effective. Jacques Denis cited many examples to illustrate this.

Unity is the main spirit of all the preparations for the World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

The desire of youth for unity is reflected in the will of the people of all countries to resolve differences through consultation. At the same time, this is also the result of the efforts of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which has been committed to this cause since its establishment. In the years since the Second World Youth Congress, the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth with the aim of achieving the broadest possible unity have been unprecedentedly strengthened.

The federation tirelessly calls on youth to unite and cooperate. Many organizations cooperate in various ways. We salute them and will strive to develop this cooperation for the benefit of youth.

However, some organizations stubbornly refuse to respond to the suggestions of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Among them are the International Youth Conference, the International Union of Socialist Youth, and the Christian Labor Youth Federation. We suggest to them again that cooperation is not for being rejected and using this rejection. We suggest cooperation to them because it is a way to greatly advance the activities of youth in the struggle to realize their legitimate hopes.

Youth are becoming more and more united, but our achievements are still small. Today, when the fate of countries and our entire future are at stake, all youth must try to make their voices heard.

Undoubtedly, the congress, which speaks for the entire young generation, must instruct the World Federation of Democratic Youth to once again suggest cooperation to various youth organizations in order to carry out practical cooperation in the name of peace, for the economic and social rights of youth, and for jointly conducting cultural and sports activities.

We want to promote sincere concerted action, and we are prepared to do our best. Besides the desire for cooperation and mutual loyalty, we do not stipulate any other conditions.

In any case, it is necessary for youth to take concerted action, and there can be great flexibility in the choice of the form of activity. For example, it may be suggested that the youth of factories and schools jointly formulate a plan listing their specific requirements and then try their best to meet these requirements. National committees can be greatly expanded, and they must do important work.

Every action of youth to fight for the right to work must immediately receive the full support of all youth organizations.

We believe that it is very important to organize new activities among different strata of youth, such as young farmers, civil servants, and women. The suggestion of organizing an international youth farmers congress next year is noteworthy. Initiatives like this will receive our full support, just as it should receive the support of all organizations that care about the plight of young farmers.

In every country, special attention should be paid to organizing local, regional, and national conferences.

Jacques Denis then described in detail the situation of youth fighting for the right to education and education in their native language, the situation of developing cultural and sports activities among youth, as well as developing international exchanges, and the situation of youth fighting for the right to vacations and improving living conditions.

Youth are launching an unprecedentedly broad struggle for peace and national independence, which will make it possible for their wishes to be fulfilled.

The struggle for peace has become the sacred responsibility of youth. It is combined with the struggle for survival.

Jacques Denis then cited many examples to illustrate the struggle that youth in capitalist countries are waging against the current war and against war preparations.

Jacques Denis asked: So what are our current tasks in the struggle for peace and national independence? First of all, we must step up the recruitment of youth into the struggle of the people of all countries for peace.

The current task is to step up the great movement for negotiation. The idea of holding consultations and discussions in order to reach an agreement is not just a matter for the governments of various countries. If it penetrates the minds of the people of all countries, it will be victorious. And the youth who have friendly feelings and a desire to get close to each other can make this idea their own and vigorously promote its realization.

The World Peace Council emphasized that the people of all countries should carry out these activities in accordance with the current conditions in various places. This means: it is necessary to strengthen the connection between youth organizations and the peace movement in various places. In this regard, taking into account the specific conditions of each country, it is necessary to launch activities that can promote the resolution of all disputes. In this way, a common agreement can be reached, which can be expressed in a peace convention; strive for peace in Korea, strive to end all ongoing wars, strive for a peaceful settlement of the German issue and the Japanese issue, strive for the right of self-determination of every nation, oppose foreign occupation and dependent status, stop the arms race, strive for disarmament, increase peaceful construction appropriations, oppose the extension of military service, and strive to expand international economic and cultural exchanges. We especially need to constantly strengthen our solidarity with the youth of colonies and dependent countries.

Denis called for further expansion of the work of the World Federation of Democratic Youth—the indomitable fighter for the unity of the young generation.

In recent months, dozens more organizations have expressed their willingness to join the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Among them are organizations containing the most diverse political tendencies, cultural and sports organizations, youth amateur activity groups and scouting groups, committees to protect youth, and trade union youth responsible cadre groups, as well as local, regional, and national organizations. If they agree with the World Federation of Democratic Youth's propositions of peace and friendship, there is a place for them in the ranks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

Jacques Denis finally said: We believe that uniting all youth is our main task. All youth must enthusiastically contribute their infinite youth combat strength and new efforts to the cause of defending peace. They must strengthen the brotherly friendship and mutual respect between countries, develop and consolidate cultural and sports relations. In order to carry out their struggle for rights, they must save the hundreds of billions of money that are now used for military expenditures but are necessary to meet the needs of the people and their development. Youth organizations must hold meetings, reach agreements, and make the government feel in the negotiations how great is the will of the growing generation to fight for peace.

We call on youth to devote themselves to this great cause. Forward, for our future, for peace, for friendship and happiness!

Cheers resounded throughout the hall. Everyone stood up.

### 争取和平和青年的权利  世界青年代表大会开幕

    争取和平和青年的权利
    世界青年代表大会开幕
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布加勒斯特二十六日电：第三届世界青年代表大会于二十五日在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特开幕。
    布加勒斯特殷勤地接待已经到达的八十多个国家的青年代表（有些国家的代表团还在路上）。城市披上了节日的盛装，正如城内的居民所说的，比平常显得年轻了。家家户户都显示出布加勒斯特居民和全体罗马尼亚人民为和平、为国际和平合作而斗争的感情和希望。所有的建筑物、街道和广场上都装饰着五色缤纷的旗帜、画版、标语以及世界民主青年联盟、国际学生联合会和第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的标帜。
    和平与友谊——世界民主青年联盟的这句口号生动地表现在布加勒斯特的节日装饰中。这句话是七月二十五日开幕的世界青年代表大会的口号。
    各种不同见解、种族、国籍和社会出身的男女青年参加这次代表大会，使大会成了一个希望维护和平和切身权利的青年的真正的盛大集会。
    出席代表大会开幕仪式的来宾中有：罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团主席彼得鲁·格罗查博士、康·巴洪院士、大山郁夫、埃利萨·布兰柯、坎德拉里亚·罗德里格斯夫人和世界工会联合会代表埃米尔·奥托。
    世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼致简短的开幕词。
    大会一致通过了以下议程：
    世界民主青年联盟自第二届世界青年代表大会以来的活动，以及青年在争取和平与他们的权利的斗争中的任务。罗马尼亚人民共和国科学院院长特拉扬·萨伏列斯库致祝辞。他说，罗马尼亚人民欣然地欢迎第三届世界青年代表大会的代表们。萨伏列斯库表示他深深相信：表现在和平与友好这一句口号中的、使得大会代表到罗马尼亚人民共和国来的思想与感情会传布到世界各地去。今天，人民、各国与各民族之间的相互了解和团结一致比以前任何时候都重要。
    七月二十五日的会议由雷纳托·特齐（意大利）、毕尔·魏尔麦特（加拿大）、和索兰凯·德罗建德
    （尼日利亚）担任主席。
    雅克·德尼代表世界民主青年联盟理事会作了关于世界民主青年联盟自第二届世界青年代表大会以来的活动以及青年在争取和平与他们的权利的斗争中的任务的报告。
    雅克·德尼说：召集这次大会的世界民主青年联盟希望这次大会成为一个争取和平，争取成长中的一代的权利的青年力量的盛会。世界民主青年联盟认为，只有以互相信任的精神，只有大家团结一致，才能实现青年的愿望，因此它向一切国际性的、全国性的、地方性的组织，向所有青年男女——不论他们的见解、种族、民族与社会出身如何——发出同志的呼吁，要求他们积极参加大会的筹备工作、参加大会。世界民主青年联盟因此再一次地表现它促进青年之间的互相了解，以及与各种青年组织合作的愿望。
    今天，我们在这里欢迎许多在过去没有与世界民主青年联盟合作的朋友。每一个人都将有一切机会说出他的思想中的最重要的问题，并参加作出大会决议的工作。
    我们一定要作出对我们大家都有利的决议，因为我们将不讨论使我们分裂的问题，而是要讨论使我们团结起来的问题、对我们至关紧要的问题：青年的权利；他们要求一个完美的、愉快的生活的愿望；他们的争取和平和各国人民民族独立的愿望。
    雅克·德尼指出：团结了八十八个国家的七千五百万青年的世界民主青年联盟是最有代表性的国际青年组织。他说：只有在一个和平的，各国人民都是朋友的世界里，青年的理想——关于他们的前途的理想，获得知识的理想，在一个独立的祖国过健康的、有文化的、自由的生活的理想——才能成为事实。
    但是今天在千百万青年男女的心里不仅是充满了美丽的理想，也充满了对明天的忧虑。
    朝鲜、越南和马来亚战争使青年遭受的痛苦是一个悲惨的现实。许多国家中的青年对明天感到忧虑。
    青年需要工作，但是，在许多国家中有千百万男女青年失业，其中有些人从来就不曾有过任何职业。千百万青年只有部分时间有工作。千百万青年失业者领不到救济金，饿着肚子到处流浪着寻找生计。在日本一个国家就有一千万失业者，其中大约百分之五十是青年。根据国家劳工介绍所公布的统计数字，意大利有六十多万失业的男女青年。
    在许多国家中，青年除了工资很低之外，还受到种族歧视。女青年所受到的不公正待遇尤其惊人，她们作为青年工人和女工而受到双重歧视。
    在乡村中，千百万青年没有土地。他们不得不当雇工，替别人种地，勉强维持生活，或者是当佃农，把大部分收成交给人家。
    对青年说来，求学是十分重要的。但是，许多国家广大的青年群众没有可能受到教育。例如在意大利，数十万青年（大部在南部）不能进学校，同时又有将近十万失业教师。
    青年需要过健康愉快的生活。但是，千百万人民生活在容易染病、而又无钱治病的处境中。由于生活水平低，巴西人的平均寿命不超过二十七岁。千百万青年住在贫民窟中。
    在殖民地和附属国中，政府通常不拨出款项，作为教育和体育费用。
    雅克·德尼说，青年需要在自由、独立的祖国生活。但是在许多国家中，民主权利受到侵犯。许多青年团体受到迫害，甚至被宣布非法。他们的领袖因为维护青年的利益而被投入狱中，并且常常遭到杀害。他们的报纸遭到检查、迫害、封闭。这种事件常常发生，例如像在伊拉克、法国、土耳其、美国、西德以及其他许多国家中。
    千百万男女青年没有权利升起祖国的国旗，没有权利用祖国的语文说话，读书。
    肥沃的田野变成了军事基地，和平村庄附近到处都是不祥的炸弹仓库。
    这就是年青一代的理想所得到的答复。
    为什么会这样呢？因为在许多国家中，包括青年的命运在内的每一样东西都服从于准备新战争的政策。
    在这些国家中，青年不再被认为是人类的希望，而被认为是廉价的奴隶，或是将来毁灭性战争中的炮灰。
    这就是为什么这样多工厂倒闭、通货膨胀和税款吞噬了大部分工资、青年的要求得不到满足的道理。
    在大部分预算是用于和平建设的各国——例如我们聚会的所在地罗马尼亚——的情况就完全不同。
    青年们看到，在他们面前有两条路：一条路引向灾难和战争，另一条是引向和平的光明大道，在那里，每一个努力都带来更好的生活和发展。
    青年们的选择是明显的：他们选择为幸福、为和平、为独立而斗争的道路。
    雅克·德尼说，过去几年中的国际形势的特点是全世界和平运动的不可抵抗的发展。各国人民的这个运动说明了国际形势中发生的一切巨大的变化。
    今年春天，青年们怀着极大的希望，注意着为使悬而未决的问题能得到和平解决而作的新的努力。苏联政治家提请人们注意苏联外交政策的和平原则，并表示他们深信，没有任何悬而未决的问题不能通过有关国家互相协商的方式解决。青年们看到了中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国两国政府为结束朝鲜战争而一再采取的具体行动。
    青年们痛恨南朝鲜独裁者擅自粗暴地破坏关于遣返战俘协议，痛恨受到某些集团支持的纳粹分子企图在柏林制造一个新的战争温床。青年们认为，这证明了反动势力想延长并扩大现在正在进行的血腥战争，使国际局势更加紧张。
    朝鲜谈判的结果证明和平战士的警惕和镇静能够粉碎一切挑衅。
    最近在希望和警惕的口号下召开的世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议决定组织一个巨大的群众运动来争取协商和和平解决一切悬而未决的问题。青年们在希望和警惕的口号下团结起来，加强开辟走向光明的将来的争取和平和民族独立的斗争。
    雅克·德尼在谈到青年为争取更好的生活和和平而进行的斗争以及他们在扩大斗争中的任务时着重指出：主要的任务之一是团结正在为青年的权利、青年的幸福生活、为和平和民族独立而斗争的年青一代。青年的团结是他们获得胜利的主要条件之一。他指出，各组织的青年成员的思想、青年的关系和青年组织间的关系有了巨大的变化。
    越来越多的青年男女在同样的愿望和利益的推动下，团结起来，达成了协议并采取了一致行动。千百万青年人从他们切身的经验中知道团结是可能、必要而有效的。雅克·德尼举出了许多例子来说明这一点。
    团结一致是世界青年代表大会和第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的一切筹备工作的主要精神。
    青年们要求团结的愿望反映在各国人民希望协商解决分歧的意志上。同时，这也是自从建立以来一直致力于这一事业的世界民主青年联盟努力的结果。从第二届世界青年代表大会举行以来的这些年中，世界民主青年联盟的目的在达成尽可能最广泛的团结的活动已经空前地加强了。
    联盟不倦地号召青年团结一致实行合作。许多组织以种种方式实行合作。我们向它们致敬，并将努力使这种合作为了青年的利益而发展下去。
    但是某些组织顽固地拒绝答复世界民主青年联盟的建议。其中有国际青年大会、国际社会主义青年联盟和基督教劳动青年联合会。我们再度向它们建议合作不是为了被拒绝和利用这种拒绝。我们向它们建议合作是因为这是一个能使青年在争取实现他们的合法希望的斗争中的活动得到巨大进展的办法。
    青年正越来越团结一致，但是我们的成就还是很小。今天，当各国的命运和我们整个的前途处于危险境地的时候，所有青年必须设法让他们的声音被听到。
    无疑的，代表整个年青一代发言的大会必须责成世界民主青年联盟再次向各青年组织建议合作，这是为了要在和平的名义下进行实际的合作，为了青年的经济和社会权利，为了共同进行文化和体育活动。
    我们要促进真诚的一致行动，我们准备尽最大的力量，除了合作与相互忠诚的愿望以外，我们不规定任何其他的条件。
    在任何场合，青年采取一致行动都是必要的，在选择活动的形式方面，可以有极大的伸缩性。譬如说，不妨建议工厂、学校的青年联合拟订一个列出他们具体要求的计划，然后尽力使这些要求得到满足。全国性的委员会可以大大地扩大，它们必须做重要的工作。
    青年们争取工作权利的每一个行动必须立即得到所有青年组织的全力支持。
    我们认为在不同阶层的青年，譬如青年农民、公务员与妇女等之间组织新的活动是十分重要的。关于在明年组织国际青年农民大会的建议是值得注意的。像这样的倡议将得到我们的全力支持，正如它应该得到所有关心青年农民的困苦生活的组织的支持一样。
    在每一个国家都应该特别注意组织地方性的、区域性的和全国性的会议。
    雅克·德尼然后详细叙述了青年争取受教育、受本民族语言教育的权利的斗争的情况，叙述了在青年中间发展文化与体育活动的情况，以及发展国际交流，青年争取休假权利与改善居住条件的斗争的情况。
    青年正在展开一个空前广泛的争取和平与民族独立的斗争，这将使得他们的愿望有可能得到满足。
    争取和平的斗争已经成了青年们的神圣责任。它是与生存的斗争结合在一起的。
    雅克·德尼然后举出了许多例子来说明资本主义国家的青年正在进行的反对现行战争和反对备战的斗争。
    雅克·德尼问道：那么在争取和平与民族独立的斗争中，我们当前的任务是什么呢？首先我们必须加紧吸收青年加入世界各国人民争取和平的斗争。
    目前的任务是加紧进行伟大的争取协商的运动。举行协商和讨论以便得出协议的思想，并不单是各国政府的事。它如果深入了各国人民的思想，它就会取得胜利。而怀着友好感情与彼此接近的愿望的青年可以使这个思想成为他们自己的思想，并大力促其实现。
    世界和平理事会强调指出，各国人民应该按照目前各地的条件，进行这些活动。这意味着：必须在各地加强青年组织与和平运动的联系。在这方面，考虑到每个国家的具体条件，必须展开可以促成一切争执问题的解决的活动。这样就可以得出共同协议，这个协议可以用一个和平公约表达出来；争取朝鲜和平，争取结束所有正在进行的战争，争取和平解决德国问题和日本问题，争取每个民族的自决权利，反对外国占领和附属地位，停止军备竞赛，争取裁减军备，增加和平建设拨款，反对延长兵役期限，争取扩大国际经济与文化交流。我们特别需要不断地加强与殖民地和附属国青年的团结一致。
    德尼要求进一步展开世界民主青年联盟——争取年青一代团结一致的不屈不挠的战士——的工作。
    在最近几个月里面，又有了几十个组织表示愿意加入世界民主青年联盟。其中有包含最不相同的政治倾向的组织、文化和体育组织、组织青年业余活动的团体和童子军团体、保卫青年的委员会和工会青年负责干部的团体，以及地方性的、区域性的和全国性的组织。假如它们同意世界民主青年联盟的和平与友好的主张的话，在世界民主青年联盟的队伍中是有它们的地位的。
    雅克·德尼最后说：我们认为使所有青年团结一致是我们的主要任务。所有青年必须把他们的无限的青年战斗力量与新的努力热烈贡献给保卫和平的事业。他们必须加强各国之间兄弟般的友好关系与相互尊重，发展并巩固文化与体育关系。为了开展他们的争取权利的斗争，他们必须拯救现在用于军事开支的，但是为满足人民的需要和他们的发展所必需的数百亿金钱。青年组织必须举行会议，达成协议，并使得政府在谈判中感觉到成长中的一代争取和平的意志是多么伟大。
    我们号召青年投身于这个伟大的事业。前进，为了我们的将来，为了和平，为了友谊与幸福！
    欢呼声响彻大厅。全体起立。
