A Letter to Hero Battalion Commander Hao Zhongyun

Battalion Commander:
    As we were about to launch an attack on the enemy's position on "Old Baldy Hill," I was not far from you. In the light of the enemy's flares, I saw you standing in the middle of the assault platoon, encouraging every heroic soldier around you with a cheerful look. When our artillery began to fire, the shells flew over like a torrential rain, exploding on "Old Baldy Hill," the comrades became even more excited and nervous. At this moment, I saw that your eyes never left the watch in your hand. Suddenly, I heard you shout "Charge!" I left you with this sound and charged towards the enemy's position with my comrades.
    The battle ended victoriously, and the red flag was planted on "Old Baldy Hill." I was gloriously wounded and returned to the motherland for recuperation, while you went to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao with even greater honor.
    After leaving you, we often talked about the battle. One day, in the ward, a comrade took out a study notebook with many pictures of combat heroes cut from pictorial magazines. Everyone gathered around, flipping through them one by one. "Hey! So many commemorative medals!" one comrade said enviously, pointing to the photo. "See what the name is?" another comrade said, pointing to the words on the photo and reading: "Combat Hero Battalion Commander, First-Class Merit Citation, Hao Zhongyun."
    "He is our battalion commander!" your soldier He Xicheng said excitedly.
    "He's your battalion commander?" one comrade asked with great admiration.
    "Yes! He personally led our troops to capture 'Old Baldy Hill' and even carried back a captured heavy machine gun."
    "He's really something!"
    "Then he'll be awarded again this time?"
    "Of course! Now he has returned to the motherland and gone to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao."
    From then on, the comrades recuperating here seemed to respect and be closer to us, calling us the glorious soldiers of the hero battalion commander. They often asked us to tell them about your situation in the army and your heroic deeds.
    One night, it was raining outside, and the electric lights illuminated the ward as bright as day. Many comrades were lying in bed reading comic books and newspapers. At this time, I was also looking at a "Northeast Daily" newspaper. When I saw the words "Old Baldy Hill" on the newspaper, I excitedly said to everyone, "Old Baldy Hill! Good news!" "Read it to us, teacher!" everyone requested. "Okay! Listen!" I began to read. When I read, "Pioneer battalion commander, Hao Zhongyun, a first-class meritorious man with his chest full of medals, awards, and commemorative medals, he personally led his troops to fight on 'Old Baldy Hill'..." the comrades applauded. A comrade named Cui Mingde, who was not far from my bed, was our company's cultural worker. He hurriedly lifted the quilt and jumped out of bed without even putting on his shoes. "Let me see!" He snatched the newspaper from my hand. At this time, the ward was filled with a joyful atmosphere. Comrades from other units were very envious of our full and happy emotions, which were inspired by a high sense of honor.
    Battalion Commander: Think about it, we are all soldiers under your command. When we saw your name and such news, how excited and proud we were!
    Comrade Wu Dehai of the Third Company, his left hand had two fingers blown off. After being admitted to the hospital, he asked me to write three letters back to the company, expressing his determination to the company leaders that he would recuperate in peace and return to the company resolutely after his injury healed. I asked him, "Can you still shoot a gun with that hand?" "What's wrong with this hand! This hand can still shoot a gun!" He answered me very seriously, making a shooting motion.
    Battalion Commander: Your soldiers recuperating here all have such determination. We all feel honored to be soldiers of a hero battalion commander. Therefore, we are recuperating with peace of mind, studying actively, and also taking the lead in helping the nurses with their work. Everyone is looking forward to and striving to recover their health as soon as possible, to return to the Korean front to see you, to live and fight with you.
    Battalion Commander: Rest assured! Our fighting spirit is always strong. Under your education, help, and influence, we know how our glory comes from, and we know even more why the people of the motherland call us "the most beloved people." Today, we are recuperating here with peace of mind. When our injuries are healed, we will return to the Korean front and continue to fight to defend the safety of Korea and the motherland, and to defend the peace of the East and the world.
    Dear Battalion Commander, see you again in Korea!
    Wishing you good health!
    Your soldier Zou Dagang, recuperating in Northeast China

### 给英雄营长郝忠云的信

专栏：

    给英雄营长郝忠云的信营长：
    在我们就要向“老秃山”敌人的阵地发起冲锋的时候，我离你不远，在敌人的照明弹的光亮下，我看见你站在突击排的中间，用愉快的眼光，鼓励着你周围的每一个英雄的战士。当我们大炮一开始发射，炮火排山倒海地飞过来，像暴雨一般落在“老秃山”上爆炸着，同志们更加高兴和紧张起来了，这时，我看见你的眼睛一直没有离开过你手上的表。猛听你喊了一声“冲！”我就随着这声音离开了你，和战友们一起冲向敌人的阵地。
    战斗胜利地结束了，红旗插上了“老秃山”，我光荣地负了伤，回祖国休养，你却带着更大的荣誉，到北京去见毛主席了。
    离开你以后，我们常常谈论这次战斗的经过。有一天，在病房里，一位同志拿出了一个学习本子，上面贴着很多从画报上剪下来的战斗英雄的照片，大家都围在一起，一篇一篇地翻着看。“咦！好多纪念章！”一位同志很羡慕地指着照片说。“看看叫什么名字？”另一位同志边说边指着照片上的字念道：“战斗英雄营长、一等功臣郝忠云。”
    “他就是我们营的营长！”你的战士何喜成兴奋地说。
    “是你们营长？”一个同志十分敬佩地这样问。
    “是的！他亲自带领我们部队攻下了‘老秃山’，并且还扛了一挺缴获的重机枪回来呢。”
    “真有两下子！”
    “那这回他又得立功了？”
    “当然啰！现在他已经回祖国，到北京见毛主席去了。”
    从此，休养的同志对我们好像更尊敬和更亲近了，都称呼我们是英雄营长的光荣战士；并且常常要我们讲述你在部队的情形和你的英雄事迹。
    有一天晚上，外面下着小雨，电灯光照耀的病房里，像白天一样地明亮。很多同志都躺在床上看连环图画和报纸。这时，我也在看着一张“东北日报”。当我一下看见报纸上有“老秃山”三个字的时候，我就很兴奋地对大家说：“老秃山！好消息！”“给念念吧，教员！”大家要求着。“好！听着吧！”我开始念了。当我念到“先锋营长，胸前挂满勋章、奖章和纪念章的一等功臣郝忠云，他曾亲自率领他的部队打上‘老秃山’……”的时候，同志们鼓起掌来了。离我床位不远有一个叫做崔明德的同志，是咱连的文化工作员，他急忙掀开被窝，连鞋都没来及穿就从床上跳过来，“给我看！”“呼拉”一声就把我手里的报纸抢去了。这时，病房里充满了喜悦的气氛。其他单位的同志，都十分羡慕我们这种被高度的荣誉感激发起来的饱满而快乐的情绪。
    营长：你想想，我们都是在你率领下的战士，当我们看到了你的名字和这样的消息时，我们是多么兴奋，而且感到多么光荣啊！
    三连吴德海同志，他的左手被炸断了两个指头。入院以后，就请我给他写了三封信回连队，向连首长下决心，说他一定要安心休养，伤好后，坚决回连队。我问他：“你那只手还能打枪吗？”“这只手有啥！这只手还能打枪嘛！”他比着打枪的动作，很严肃地回答我。
    营长：在这里休养的你的战士们，都有这样的决心。我们都感到作为一个英雄营长的战士的光荣。因此，我们休养也很安心，学习也很积极，并且还带头帮助护士们工作。大家都盼望着、争取着早日恢复健康，早日回到朝鲜前线看你，和你在一块儿生活，一块儿战斗。
    营长：你放心吧！我们的战斗情绪是永远旺盛的。在你的教育、帮助和影响下面，我们知道我们的光荣是怎样得来的，我们更知道祖国人民为什么称呼我们是“最可爱的人”。今天，我们在这里安心地休养，伤好了，我们重返朝鲜前线，继续为保卫朝鲜和祖国的安全、为保卫东方和世界的和平而战斗。
    敬爱的营长，回到朝鲜再见吧！
    祝你身体健康！
    你在祖国东北休养的战士邹大刚
    一九五三年五月二十日
