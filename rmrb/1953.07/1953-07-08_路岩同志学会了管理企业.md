    Comrade Lu Yan Learns to Manage Enterprises
    Yin Qin, Xiao Te
    On the economic construction front in our country, many Communist Party members have worked hard to learn the methods of managing enterprises. Comrade Lu Yan, Director of Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Director of Tangshan Power Plant, is one of them.
    Comrade Lu Yan came to the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau in 1950, but she had never worked in a factory, let alone a power plant. Therefore, when she first came to this factory, she knew nothing. At that time, she thought: How can I lead this? Study! It's so complicated, when will I ever learn it? But she also remembered what Chairman Mao said: “We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we don’t understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). We should take them as teachers, learn respectfully and honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. ... Get in, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, you can always learn.” In this way, she had the confidence to learn how to manage an enterprise. The fact is that, after two years of hard work, she finally became a relatively skilled enterprise manager.
    In such a short period of time, how did Comrade Lu Yan become a relatively skilled enterprise manager? Even people in the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant were surprised. In fact, it is very simple, she just followed Chairman Mao's instructions and learned from all the experts: learning from engineering and technical personnel, learning from workers, and learning from colleagues who came before her. For example, every time there was a major overhaul or minor repair, she would go into the machines with the workers and engineering technicians to work and study. In this way, Lu Yan quickly understood the structure of some machines and the function of each part, understood where accidents were likely to occur, and how to prevent and deal with them. In addition, she also worked hard to study the theory of economic construction and related business publications. Stalin's "Problems of Leninism" and "People's Electric Power" were books she often read. This kind of learning not only made Lu Yan familiar with the business, but also increased her sensitivity to new things. Therefore, she was able to first pay attention to promoting various advanced experiences. When the Tangshan Power Plant decided to test burning low-value coal, she personally led the work. Before the test burning, she made various estimates of the test burning situation, estimated that the boiler pressure might drop, and made necessary preparations. After the test burning started, the pressure did drop, falling from 19,000 kilowatts to 12,000 kilowatts at the worst, greatly reducing power generation. At this time, some people panicked, some said: "This is not burning low-value coal, it's simply burning stones." Others said:
    "It won't work, why bother with this effort?" Although Lu Yan was also very anxious, she knew that this was an advanced experience, and the Shijingshan Power Plant had already successfully tested it. Therefore, on the one hand, she stabilized the emotions of the workers, and on the other hand, she held a forum for worker representatives to study the problem. At the meeting, everyone proposed that finding ways to control the drop in pressure was the main problem at present.
    Comrade Lu Yan accepted this suggestion and called on all employees of the plant to "think of ways and act as advisors" to solve the problem of pressure drop. This call immediately became a mass movement. Engineer Ning Zhirong first suggested installing a pulverized coal injector to supplement combustion and control the pressure. Comrade Lu Yan immediately supported this suggestion and mobilized other engineering and technical personnel to assist. With the efforts of technicians and workers, the pulverized coal injector was quickly installed, and pulverized coal was injected to assist combustion, controlling the pressure. Then, research was conducted to improve the technology of burning low-value coal. After continuous efforts, the test burning of low-value coal was finally successful.
    The thermal efficiency of the boiler workshop in the Tangshan Power Plant fluctuated, affecting coal consumption. Therefore, after the advanced experience of counterbalancing thermal efficiency was published in "People's Electric Power," Comrade Lu Yan immediately organized technicians and cadres to study it, and asked engineer Wang Shuzeng to give her lectures and study it carefully. Under the leadership of Comrade Lu Yan, other colleagues in the trade union also began to study, so that most of the leading cadres mastered this advanced experience. Then, engineer Wang Shuzeng was invited to explain to the workers and give demonstrations. Therefore, the workers quickly mastered this advanced experience. Since then, the boiler thermal efficiency has steadily increased. The combustibles in the ash and slag have now been reduced from about 22 percent last year to about 9 percent, greatly helping to reduce coal consumption.
    The national plan is the law. Therefore, Comrade Lu Yan did everything possible to mobilize the vast number of employees to complete the national plan. When revising the 1953 plan, the North China Electric Power Administration gave the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau the task of increasing electricity sales by 4 percent over last year and keeping the line loss rate below 7.5 percent. After mobilizing and communicating the national plan indicators, some cadres said: The leadership should not accept such a large task. Comrade Lu Yan patiently explained to the cadres: "The motherland has begun large-scale economic construction, and we should find ways to create more wealth and accumulate funds for the country. Completing this task is difficult, but we must overcome these difficulties, and we will definitely be able to overcome these difficulties." In order to better complete the task, Comrade Lu Yan organized cadres and employees to go to various factories and mines to understand the situation and calculate the amount of electricity used in various places. According to understanding, the Tangshan Steel Plant alone can increase electricity consumption by 500,000 kilowatt-hours. In this way, not only can the sales task proposed by the higher authorities be completed, but it can also exceed 700,000 kilowatt-hours, which has increased the unlimited confidence of the employees.
    Comrade Lu Yan knew that to manage an enterprise well, it is also necessary to consult with workers frequently and listen to their opinions. Therefore, she often educated cadres by saying, "If you want to comprehensively complete various plans, you must mobilize the workers; otherwise, the plan will not be easy to complete." She often criticized those who did not rely on workers and did not pay attention to workers' rationalization proposals. Last summer, the condensing water temperature of the turbine rose sharply, the turbine vacuum decreased significantly, and the thermal efficiency of the boiler workshop could not be improved, seriously affecting the completion of the coal consumption plan indicators. At this time, Liu Zhonglin, director of the turbine workshop, and worker Li Xiushan, etc., suggested building a dam at the outlet to lower the water temperature. However, some technicians looked down on this suggestion and ignored it. After Comrade Lu Yan learned about it, she said to these people, "Rationalization proposals should not be judged by their size in form, especially since lowering the water temperature is currently related to the completion of the production plan." She immediately mobilized technicians to study this rationalization proposal, and personally went to measure and test with engineering technicians. The results showed that adopting this rationalization proposal could reduce the water temperature by three degrees, helping the boiler workshop to complete the coal consumption plan indicators and ensuring the completion of the turbine workshop's technical indicator plan. Lu Yan immediately commended Liu Zhonglin and Li Xiushan.
    Because Comrade Lu Yan was able to solve problems in a timely manner, employees would go to her whenever they had a problem that could not be solved. In March of this year, the Tangshan Power Plant wanted to promote the advanced experience of Soviet wind pressure layered combustion. To learn from this advanced experience, it was necessary to modify some equipment. When designing the wind duct for wind pressure layered combustion, engineers Yu Shubin and Xu Chengzhi had different opinions. According to Yu Shubin's opinion, the wind duct should be larger, while Xu Chengzhi's opinion was that it should be smaller (the size of the wind duct has a great relationship with whether it is convenient to disassemble and install during future equipment maintenance). The two argued endlessly, and even the chief engineer could not make a conclusion. Engineer Xu Chengzhi said: "Let's go to Director Lu!" After listening to their opinions, Comrade Lu Yan learned about the situation from the employees, and held a meeting to discuss the characteristics of the two designs. After understanding and discussion, Comrade Lu Yan understood that Engineer Xu's design was still better. However, in order to make a more complete conclusion, she sent technicians to Beijing to consult experts and to the Xiahuayuan Power Plant to visit. After such a series of research work, Engineer Yu finally agreed to Engineer Xu's design. Not only was Engineer Xu satisfied, but Engineer Yu was also very satisfied, praising Lu Yan's method of handling problems.
    In order to do a good job, Comrade Lu Yan cherished her body very much, but she cherished the state's property even more. During the flood season last year, the water in the Douhe River rose sharply, and the power plant was surrounded by water on three sides, and the situation was very serious; the director and the secretary of the trade union were not in the plant (at that time, Lu Yan was the Deputy Secretary of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Deputy Director of the Tangshan Power Plant). In order to protect the factory, Comrade Lu Yan mobilized and led the employees to build river embankments and patrol day and night. During the most tense days, Comrade Lu Yan did not sleep for several nights in a row, personally went to the embankment, and closed her eyes on the embankment when she was sleepy. The flood prevention work was victorious, and she was thinner than before.
    Caring for the lives of employees is one of the characteristics of Comrade Lu Yan's work. She often goes to the homes of employees' families to understand their living conditions. When there is a problem, she helps to solve it. When she learned that engineer Wang Shuzeng's child was scalded by boiling water, she inquired about the treatment as if she cared for her own child. Liang Tiancheng, a student in the business science department of the Electric Power Bureau, burned his eyes while testing electric meters. After Lu Yan learned about it, she immediately went to the hospital to see him and told him to take a good rest. This made the employees feel very warm when they were with her, so they were willing to approach her and talk to her about production problems. Sometimes Lu Yan knew about problems that even the workshop director did not know. For example, the fact that individual workers in the boiler workshop did not seriously implement the operation methods was told to her by the workers. When she asked the workshop cadres, the workshop cadres said that they were implementing them very well. She educated the workshop cadres to go deep into the masses and seriously check their work.
    Comrade Lu Yan understands that with the development of the country's large-scale economic construction, new problems are constantly emerging, which requires her to be more familiar with the business and do a good job in enterprise management. Therefore, she strictly requires herself not to be overwhelmed by her existing achievements, but to be alert to herself by the mistakes of the heroine female factory director Kabitelina in the drama "Dawn Shines on Moscow", and to require herself to work harder to study business knowledge, study economic construction theory, strengthen party spirit training, overcome her shortcomings, and adapt to the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction.

    路岩同志学会了管理企业
    殷勤  萧特
    在我国经济建设战线上，已有许多共产党员刻苦努力地学会了管理企业的方法。唐山电业局局长兼唐山发电厂厂长路岩同志就是其中的一个。
    路岩同志是一九五○年到唐山电业局工作的，可是她从来没有在工厂里工作过，更没有在发电厂中工作过。因此，她初到这个工厂时，什么也不懂。当时，她曾这样想过：这怎么领导呢？学吧！这样复杂，什么时候能学会呢？但是，她又记着毛主席的话：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。……钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”这样，她就有了信心来学会管理企业。事实就是如此，经过两年来的刻苦努力，她终于成为了一个比较熟练的企业管理人员。
    在这样短短的时期内，路岩同志究竟怎样成为一个比较熟练的企业管理人员的呢？连唐山电业局和发电厂里的人也感到惊奇。其实很简单，她只是按照毛主席所指示的，向一切内行的人学习：向工程技术人员学习，向工人学习，向比她先来的工作人员学习。例如每次大修和小修时，她和工人、工程技术人员一起钻到机器里去工作、学习。这样，路岩就很快地懂得了一些机器的构造和各个机件的作用，懂得了什么地方容易出事故，怎样防止和处理事故。此外，她还努力学习经济建设的理论和有关业务的书刊，斯大林的“列宁主义问题”及“人民电业”都是她经常阅读的书刊。这种学习，不仅使路岩熟悉了业务，又使她增加了对新鲜事物的敏感。因而她能首先注意推广各种先进经验。当唐山发电厂决定试烧低值煤时，她就亲自领导这一工作。在没有试烧以前，对试烧的情况作了各种估计，估计到锅炉气压可能下降，并做了必要的准备。试烧开始后，气压果然下降了，最严重时由一万九千瓩落到一万二千瓩，大大减少了发电量。这时有些人慌了，有的说：“这不是烧低值煤，简直烧石头。”有的说：
    “闹不成，干脆甭费这个劲了。”路岩虽然也很着急，但是她知道这是先进经验，石景山发电厂已经试烧成功。因此，她一方面稳定工人的情绪，另一方面召开工人代表座谈会，研究这一问题。会上，大家提出了设法控制落气压是目前的主要问题。
    路岩同志接受了这个建议，号召全厂职工“想办法，当军师”来解决落气压的问题。这一号召立刻成为群众性的运动。工程师宁枝荣首先建议安装喷煤粉器，以补助燃烧，控制气压。路岩同志马上支持这个建议，并动员其他工程技术人员协助。在技术人员和工人努力之下，很快安装起喷煤粉器，喷煤粉辅助燃烧，控制了气压。接着又研究提高烧低值煤的技术。经过不断的努力，试烧低值煤终于成功了。
    唐山发电厂的锅炉车间的热效率忽高忽低，影响煤耗，因此在“人民电业”上登出了反平衡热效率的先进经验后，路岩同志立即组织技术人员和干部学习，并请工程师王树增给自己讲课，认真学习。在路岩同志的带动下，其他工委同志也开始学习起来，使大部分领导干部都掌握了这一先进经验。随后又请王树增工程师给工人们讲解，举行表演。因此工人们也很快掌握了这个先进经验。从此，锅炉热效率就稳步提高。现在的灰碴可燃物已由去年的百分之二十二降到百分之九左右，大大帮助了降低煤耗。
    国家计划就是法律。因此路岩同志尽一切力量动员广大职工去完成国家计划。在修订一九五三年计划时，华北电业管理局给唐山电业局的任务是：售电量比去年提高百分之四，线路损失率不超过百分之七点五。经过动员和传达了国家计划指标以后，有的干部说：领导上不应当接受这样大的任务。路岩同志就耐心地向干部解释：“祖国开始了大规模的经济建设，我们就应当想办法给国家更多地创造财富和积累资金。完成这个任务是有困难的，但我们一定要战胜这些困难，也一定能战胜这些困难。”为了更好地完成任务，路岩同志组织干部职员分赴各厂矿去了解情况，计算各处用电量。据了解，仅唐山钢厂就可增加用电量五十万度。这样，不仅能够完成上级提出的售电任务，而且可以超过七十多万度，这就使职工增加了无限的信心。
    路岩同志知道，要把企业管理好，还必须经常和工人商量，听取工人意见。因此她经常教育干部说：“要想全面完成各种计划，就必须发动工人；否则计划是不容易完成的。”她经常批评那些不依靠工人和不重视工人合理化建议的人。去年夏季汽机凝结水温大大上升，汽机真空显著下降，锅炉车间热效率不能提高，严重地影响了煤耗计划指标的完成。这时，汽机车间主任刘钟麟和工人李秀山等建议在出水口打一席坝，以降低水温。但是有些技术人员瞧不起这个建议，置之不理。路岩同志知道以后，便对这些人说：“合理化建议不能从形式上去看大小，何况目前降低水温已关系到生产计划的完成。”她立即动员技术人员研究这一合理化建议，并亲自和工程技术人员去测量、试验。结果证明，采用这个合理化建议后，就可以使水温下降三度，帮助锅炉车间煤耗计划指标的完成，保证汽机车间技术指标计划的完成。路岩立即表扬了刘钟麟和李秀山。
    因为路岩同志能够及时解决问题，所以职工一有了不能解决的问题就去找她。今年三月里，唐山发电厂要推广苏联风压分层燃烧的先进经验，学习这个先进经验，需要改装一部分设备。在设计风压分层燃烧风筒时，于树彬和徐承志两位工程师有了不同的意见。按照于树彬的意见风筒要大些，而徐承志的意见则要小些（风筒大小对将来设备检修时拆装方便不方便有很大关系）。两人争执不下，连总工程师也不好作结论了。徐承志工程师就说：“咱们去找路局长吧！”路岩同志听取他们的意见后，就向职工了解情况，并开会座谈两种设计的特点。经过了解和座谈，路岩同志懂得了徐工程师设计还是比较好的。但是为了作出更完善的结论，又派技术人员到北京去请示专家，到下花园发电厂去参观。经过这样一系列的研究工作，于工程师最后同意了徐工程师的设计了。这不仅徐工程师满意，就是于工程师也很满意，称赞路岩处理问题的方法。
    为了做好工作，路岩同志很爱护自己的身体，但她更爱护国家的资财。去年汛期，陡河的水汹涌上涨，发电厂三面被水包围着，情况非常严重；厂长和工委书记又都不在厂（当时路岩是中共唐山电业局工作委员会副书记、唐山发电厂副厂长）。为了保护工厂，路岩同志昼夜不停地动员和领导职工修筑河堤和巡逻。在情况最紧张的几天，路岩同志连上几夜没有睡觉，亲自上堤，困了就坐在堤上合一下眼。防汛工作胜利了，她也比以前消瘦了。
    关心职工的生活，是路岩同志工作特点之一。她经常到职工家属中去了解职工的生活情况。有了问题，她就帮助解决。当她知道工程师王树增的小孩被开水烫伤后，就像关心自己的孩子一样打听治疗的情形。电业局营业科学员梁天成，因试验电表烧坏了眼睛。路岩知道以后，立刻到医院去看他，嘱咐他好好休养。这就使职工们感到和她在一起非常温暖，因此都愿接近她，和她谈生产中的问题。有时连车间主任还不知道的问题，路岩就知道了。例如锅炉车间个别工人不认真执行操作方法的事情，就是工人告诉她的。当她问到车间干部时，车间干部还说执行得很好。她就教育车间干部，要深入群众，认真检查工作。
    路岩同志懂得，随着国家大规模经济建设工作的展开，新的问题正在不断产生着，这就要求自己更加熟悉业务，做好企业管理工作。因此她严格要求自己不能因已有的成绩冲昏头脑，要以“曙光照耀着莫斯科”剧中的主角女厂长卡碧特丽娜的错误来警惕自己，要求自己更加努力地学习业务知识，学习经济建设理论，加强党性锻炼，克服自己缺点，适应国家大规模经济建设的需要。
