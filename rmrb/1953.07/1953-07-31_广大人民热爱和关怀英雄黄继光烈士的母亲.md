The mother of Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Deng Fangzhi, is receiving the love and care of people across the country.

For more than half a year, people of all ethnic groups from all over the motherland, including overseas Chinese living in countries such as Indonesia, have sent a total of more than six thousand eight hundred and ninety letters to the hero's mother, along with various gifts and photos. These letters and gifts unanimously expressed people's infinite admiration and love for the hero and the hero's mother.

A thirteen-year-old Chinese child named Li Ruilian from Bandung, Java, Indonesia, wrote a letter to the hero's mother, innocently expressing his desire to learn from the hero. He said: "When I saw Uncle Jiguang gloriously sacrifice himself by blocking the enemy's machine-gun nest with his body to eliminate the enemy, I made up my mind to study hard so that I can serve the motherland when I grow up."

During the Spring Festival this year, the hero's mother was invited by the Sichuan Military Region to Chengdu to celebrate the festival. Various agencies, organizations, schools, and street residents in Chengdu competed to invite the hero's mother to spend the New Year with them. At the gatherings held by many cadres, students, and citizens, the hero's mother carefully reported on how the Communist Party and she herself nurtured the hero Huang Jiguang, which powerfully encouraged the people's patriotic enthusiasm. In just over ten days around the Spring Festival, more than two thousand four hundred people personally or wrote letters requesting to be the hero's mother's children, willing to learn from Huang Jiguang's spirit and dedicate themselves to the construction of the motherland.

In April this year, the hero's mother went to Beijing to attend the Second National Women's Congress of China, and groups of students came to see her every day. Young students held radio forums and grand welcoming meetings to welcome Mother Huang. They all reported their academic achievements and determination to learn from hero Huang Jiguang to Mother Huang, striving to name their class the Huang Jiguang Class. Many school representatives also presented the most meaningful gifts to Mother Huang.

The warm concern and condolences of people at home and abroad for Mother Huang have further inspired Mother Huang's political enthusiasm. When she returned to her hometown from Beijing, she said enthusiastically at a welcoming meeting of more than two thousand people: "I am sixty-two years old this year, and I will continue to study hard, do a good job in production, and strive to be a model propagandist, and work together with everyone to build our new country." Mother Huang participated in the village's patriotic production increase campaign this year and is currently stepping up summer farming work, striving for a bumper harvest this year.

After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the hero's mother specially wrote a letter to all the comrades of the Volunteer Army. The letter said: "When I heard the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, I thought: the peace that our common people have been hoping for has finally been realized. Jiguang's blood was not shed in vain, and the blood of many other comrades was not shed in vain. I want to congratulate you, congratulate you on the victory of your struggle for peace; I want to thank you, thank you for realizing the people's desire for peace. But American imperialism is cunning. On their side, there are still a small group of bad guys who do not want peace. The South Korean Syngman Rhee gang will do everything possible to sabotage it. Therefore, you must be vigilant." The letter also expressed the hope that the Volunteer Army comrades would do their best to help the Korean people build their homes before returning to their motherland, and the people of the motherland would also continue to support the Korean people in various ways.

    广大人民热爱和关怀英雄黄继光烈士的母亲
    中国人民志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝，受到全国人民的热爱和关怀。
    半年多来，祖国各地各族人民，包括旅居在海外的印尼等国家的华侨，给英雄母亲寄来的信件共达六千八百九十多封，并附寄了各种礼物和照片。这些信件和礼品一致表现了人们对英雄和英雄母亲无限敬仰和爱慕的心情。
    印尼爪哇万隆市一个年仅十三岁的华侨小朋友李瑞联给英雄妈妈来信，天真地说出了他学习英雄的心愿。他说：我看到继光叔叔为消灭敌人用身体堵住敌人机枪眼而光荣牺牲，我就下定决心要努力读书，好在长大后为祖国服务。
    今年春节，英雄母亲被四川军区邀请到成都欢庆春节，成都市各机关、团体、学校和街道居民，争着请英雄母亲去过年。在好多机关干部、学生和市民举行的联欢会上，英雄母亲都仔细地报告了共产党和她自己培养英雄黄继光的经过，有力地鼓舞了人民的爱国热情。仅仅在春节前后十多天中，就有二千四百多人亲自或写信请求当英雄母亲的儿女，愿意学习黄继光的精神，献身于祖国的建设。
    今年四月间，英雄母亲曾到北京出席了中国第二次全国妇女代表大会，每天都有成群结队的学生来看望她。青年学生们为欢迎黄妈妈，召开了广播座谈会和盛大的欢迎会。他们都向黄妈妈报告了自己的学习成绩和向黄继光烈士学习的决心，争取将他们的班命名为黄继光班。许多学校代表还把最有意义的礼物献给黄妈妈。
    国内外人民对黄妈妈的热情关怀和慰问，更加鼓舞了黄妈妈的政治热情。当她从北京回到家乡后，她在二千多人的欢迎会上热情洋溢地说：“我今年六十二岁了，我还要努力学习，搞好生产，争取做一个模范宣传员，和大家一起，努力建设我们的新国家。”黄妈妈今年参加了村里的爱国增产竞赛运动，目前，正加紧进行夏季农事工作，争取今年庄稼的丰收。
    在朝鲜停战协定签字后，英雄母亲特地写信给志愿军全体同志。信中说：当我听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息后，我想：我们老百姓盼望的和平到底实现了。继光的血没有白流，其他许多同志们的血也没有白流。我要向你们祝贺，祝贺你们为和平而斗争的胜利；要感谢你们，感谢你们实现了老百姓的和平愿望。但是美帝国主义是狡猾的，在他们那边，还有一小群不愿和平的坏家伙，南朝鲜李承晚匪帮还会千方百计地进行破坏。因此，你们还要提高警惕。信中并表示希望志愿军同志们在回到祖国以前，要尽力帮助朝鲜人民建设他们的家园，祖国的人民也同样会用各种方法来继续支援朝鲜人民。　（新华社）
