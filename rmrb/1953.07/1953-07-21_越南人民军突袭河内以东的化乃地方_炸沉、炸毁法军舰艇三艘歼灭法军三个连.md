Xinhua News Agency, 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 19th: The Vietnamese People's Army, in mid-June, raided French warships anchored in Hoa Nai, about 35 kilometers east of Hanoi, sinking and destroying three French warships and annihilating nearly three companies of French troops.

    The events unfolded as follows: On June 15th, the French military headquarters in Haiphong dispatched a gunboat and four motorboats, fully loaded with troops, to Hoa Nai, preparing to launch a "mopping-up" operation towards An Dong region in Bac Giang province.

    That night, the People's Army soldiers launched a surprise attack on the newly arrived French troops. They cleverly bypassed the French army's cordon, avoided the French patrols and searchlight beams, and approached the French gunboat to detonate explosives.

    On the morning of June 16th, a terrifying explosion shook Hoa Nai. The French gunboat was sunk, and two naval platoons and one infantry company on board were all killed in the explosion. Two other motorboats were destroyed, and all the sailors were killed or wounded. Two French squads and more than forty French sailors on shore were also killed or wounded.

    The People's Army also destroyed two French observation towers, a three-story ammunition depot, and a grain depot on the shore. The destroyed French weapons included three cannons and twenty-three machine guns.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: While the French colonial authorities are trying their best to expand the Bao Dai puppet army and boasting that they have established some puppet army "commando battalions," more and more puppet army soldiers are defecting to the Vietnamese People's Army or deserting.

    According to Vietnam News Agency reports: Since the beginning of this year, several thousand puppet army soldiers from all over Vietnam have defected to the People's Army. In the Red River Delta and the central region of North Vietnam alone, more than 2,600 puppet army soldiers have surrendered. In South Vietnam, a company and a platoon of puppet troops in Gia Dinh and Ben Tre near Saigon defected to the People's Army with their weapons in February.

    Desertion among puppet troops is becoming increasingly collective. For example, in Hung Yen province in North Vietnam, a whole battalion of Muong ethnic minority puppet troops recently mutinied, injuring the French commanding officer and burning a large amount of ammunition. More than 100 of them threw down their guns and went home, and two other platoons ran away with their weapons.

    Two hundred and fifty puppet troops in Quang Nam province in central Vietnam deserted. In Nha Trang, five hundred young people who were forcibly conscripted into the puppet army refused to wear uniforms and held a hunger strike.

    In South Vietnam, five hundred puppet troops stationed along the canal abandoned their strongholds and fled at the end of June.

    越南人民军突袭河内以东的化乃地方
    炸沉、炸毁法军舰艇三艘歼灭法军三个连
    【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南人民军在六月中旬突袭停泊在河内以东约三十五公里的化乃地方的法军舰艇，炸沉和炸毁法军舰艇三艘，并歼灭法军近三个连。
    事情经过如下：六月十五日，海防的法军司令部派了一艘炮舰和四艘汽艇满载军队开到了化乃，准备向北江省的安东地区发动“扫荡”。
    当天夜里，人民军战士对新开到的法军进行了突袭，他们机智地越过法军的警戒线，避开了法军的巡逻队和探照灯光，逼近法军炮舰利用炸药进行爆炸。
    六月十六日清晨，可怕的爆炸声震撼了化乃。法军的炮舰被炸沉了，舰上的海军两个排和步兵一个连全被炸死。另有汽艇两艘被炸毁，水手们全被炸死炸伤。被炸死炸伤的还有岸上的法军两个班和法国水手四十多人。
    人民军还炸毁了岸上的法军了望塔两座、三层楼的军火库一座和粮食库一座。被炸毁的法军武器中包括大炮三门和机枪二十三挺。
    【新华社二十日讯】与法国殖民当局竭力要扩充保大伪军并吹嘘他们已经建立了一些伪军“突击营”的同时，越来越多的伪军士兵向越南人民军投诚或开小差。
    据越南通讯社消息：今年以来，越南各地伪军投奔人民军的有好几千人，仅在北越红河三角洲和中部地区，伪军归顺的就有二千六百多人。在南越，西贡附近的嘉定和槟椥两地有伪军一个连和一个排在二月间分别带着武器投奔人民军。
    伪军开小差越来越带有集体性。例如在北越的兴安省，最近有一整营芒族伪军暴动，他们将法军指挥官打伤，并烧掉了许多弹药。他们中间有一百多人丢掉枪杆回家，另两个排带了枪逃跑。
    中越广南省的伪军有二百五十人开了小差。在芽庄，被强抓去充当伪军的五百个青年拒绝穿上军服，并举行绝食。
    在南越，沿运河驻扎的伪军五百人于六月底放弃据点逃跑。
