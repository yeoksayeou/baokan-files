    Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture Holds Conference on Opera Work to Review and Summarize Creative and Performance Work in the First Half of the Year
    To review Shanghai's opera reform work and summarize the creative and performance work of the opera community in the first half of this year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture held a conference on opera creation and performance work from June 2nd to 27th. More than 700 people attended, including heads of various opera genres and troupes, leading actors, and major playwrights and directors from across the city's opera community. The conference adopted the methods of plenary reports and group discussions to analyze and discuss the problems existing in the creation and performance of the Shanghai opera community in the past six months and conducted bottom-up criticism. The main directors, playwrights, and actors of various opera genres and troupes also made preliminary reviews of the work of individuals and troupes, and the groups also put forward some suggestions to the leadership on improving future work.
    At the concluding meeting on June 26th, Liu Housheng, Deputy Director of the Art Division of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture, delivered a concluding report. After affirming the achievements, he pointed out that due to the lack of strong artistic and ideological leadership of private opera troupes, the weakness of organizational leadership, and the lack of attention to ideological work for a long period after the liberation of Shanghai, the central government's opera reform policy was not well implemented, resulting in shortcomings such as theory being divorced from reality, leaders being divorced from the masses, state-owned opera troupes being divorced from private opera troupes, and the literary and artistic thought of serving the people failing to overcome incorrect or even anti-people literary and artistic thought.
    After the rectification campaign last year, the ideological level of opera reform cadres and opera performers improved, and the opera community created and performed many excellent and relatively good plays, many of which were awarded and praised at the First National Opera Festival in October last year, as well as newly created plays. However, some troupes, due to the formulaic and conceptual nature of the plays they performed, were not welcomed by the audience. Instead of researching and improving this situation artistically, they mistakenly reverted to the path of formalism and sensationalism. After the National Festival, some artists even used the guise of "accepting national heritage" to perform many old plays containing feudal, pornographic, and superstitious toxins; this chaotic situation was particularly serious in the period before the Spring Festival this year. After the first opera creation and performance work conference held in late January this year, due to the recommendation by the leadership of the opera reform work of the National Festival repertoire and the repertoire related to marriage issues and the promotion of the Marriage Law recommended by the Ministry of Culture, the performance activities during the period after the Spring Festival were able to maintain a normal and healthy state. However, this progressive trend was not solid enough. Due to the relaxation of leadership and the insufficient understanding of the rapid development of the current situation and their own tasks by opera workers, this unstable phenomenon has become more prominent in the past two months.
    Finally, he expressed that the leadership will, in accordance with the requirements of the city's opera performers, organize performers to study and sort out old repertoires and organize creations, improve performance art, strengthen the leadership of opera criticism, and strengthen administrative management; at the same time, they will improve and enhance the quality of existing opera reform work cadres to further improve leadership and opera creation and performance work.

    上海市文化事业管理局召开戏曲工作会议
    检查总结今年上半年度的创作和演出工作
    上海市人民政府文化事业管理局为了检查上海市戏曲改革工作和总结戏曲界今年上半年度的创作和演出，从六月二日到二十七日召开戏曲创作演出工作会议，参加的有全市戏曲界各剧种、剧团负责人、主要演员和主要编剧、导演共七百多人。会议采取大会报告和小组讨论的方式，对上海市戏曲界半年来的创作和演出中存在的问题，作了分析和讨论，进行了自下而上的批评。各剧种、剧团主要编导和演员，也初步检查了个人和剧团的工作，各小组也向领导方面提出一些改进今后工作的建议。
    在六月二十六日的总结大会上，上海市人民政府文化事业管理局艺术事业管理处副处长刘厚生作了总结报告。他在肯定成绩之后指出：由于戏曲改革工作领导方面对私营剧团艺术思想领导不强，组织领导力量薄弱，在上海解放以后的一个长时期中，没有重视思想工作，没有很好地贯彻中央的戏曲改革政策，因此在进展中发生了：理论脱离实际、领导脱离群众、国营剧团脱离私营剧团、为人民服务的文艺思想不能战胜不正确的、甚至反人民的文艺思想等缺点。
    去年文艺整风后，戏曲改革工作干部和戏曲艺人思想水平提高了一步，戏曲界创作和演出了许多优秀的和较好的剧目，其中有许多是去年十月第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会上受到奖励、称赞的剧目和新创作的剧目。但是也有一些剧团，由于演出的戏公式化、概念化，不受观众欢迎。对这种情况又没有在艺术上进行研究、改进，却错误地回复到形式主义、噱头主义的道路上去。全国会演后，更有一些艺人打着“接受民族遗产”的幌子，演出许多含有封建、色情、迷信等毒素的旧戏；这种混乱情况在今年春节以前一个时期特别严重。今年一月下旬，戏曲界举行第一次戏曲创作演出工作会议后，由于戏曲改革工作领导方面推荐了全国会演剧目和中央文化部所推荐的有关婚姻问题和宣传婚姻法的剧目，使春节后一个时期的演出活动，得以保持正常健康状态。但这种进步的趋向是不够巩固的，由于领导松懈，戏曲工作者对目前形势的迅速发展和本身任务认识不足，在最近两个月来，这种不稳现象更为显著。
    最后，他表示领导方面将根据全市戏曲艺人的要求，组织艺人学习、整理旧剧目与组织创作，提高表演艺术，加强戏曲批评工作的领导，加强行政管理；同时将改进和提高现有戏曲改革工作干部的质量，为进一步改善领导和戏曲创作演出工作而努力。
