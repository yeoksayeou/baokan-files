Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Moscow Dispatch: Soviet industrial enterprises are striving to reduce production costs, saving a significant amount of funds for the state and the people. The achievements and experiences of the cost reduction campaign at the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City serve as a good example.

    The Molotov Automobile Factory is one of the largest automobile factories in the Soviet Union, producing the famous Pobeda (Victory) passenger car and the GAZ-51 truck. According to a report in Pravda, the factory has achieved remarkable reductions in production costs. Compared to 1949, the cost of the Pobeda passenger car in the first four months of this year has been reduced by 49.3 percent, and the GAZ-51 truck by 42.7 percent. From the beginning of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) to April of this year, the factory has saved 37 million rubles through over-plan savings alone. The time required to produce one GAZ-51 truck in 1948 now allows for the production of two in the first quarter of this year; the working time for producing the Pobeda passenger car has also been reduced by 28 percent.

    The work of reducing costs at the Molotov Automobile Factory has become a mass movement in the factory. Personnel from all major and auxiliary workshops, as well as supply and sales management departments, have participated in this movement. All factory staff have actively demonstrated their creativity and innovation enthusiasm during the movement, and have adopted many effective measures to promote technological innovation and save raw materials. Currently, the factory has a considerable number of workers who have achieved savings of up to one million rubles. During this Five-Year Plan, workers have submitted more than 55,000 important invention and innovation proposals related to cost reduction.

    The factory's practical experience proves that to organize the large number of departments and all workers into cost reduction activities, it is necessary to systematically implement the economic accounting system. The factory has carried out very detailed and in-depth organizational preparations for implementing the economic accounting system, and has established detailed accounting systems, measurement methods, and quota targets. Each workshop has planned tasks for improving labor productivity and reducing raw material consumption. The central purpose of these systems is to promote each department to explore ways to save in production and reduce non-productive consumption. Secondly, the factory not only implements economic accounting in each workshop but also in each work section within the workshop. All factors that constitute product costs within the work section are the responsibility of the work section. This makes the work section leader not only a technical leader but also a leader in implementing savings. In addition, the factory also implements individual and production team economic accounting, which is a mass form of ensuring that every worker participates in above-plan savings. Last year alone, workers implementing individual and production team economic accounting saved a total of 15 million rubles.

    To ensure the smooth implementation of the cost reduction plan, the factory attaches great importance to improving workers' economic knowledge. The factory has specifically established an "Economic School" to teach workers economic knowledge related to production savings. 13,700 workers have studied at the "Economic School."

    苏联莫洛托夫汽车工厂减低成本运动获得了显著的成就
    【新华社七日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联各工业企业努力降低生产成本，为国家和人民节省大量资财。高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂减低成本运动的成就和经验，就是一个很好的例子。
    莫洛托夫汽车工厂是苏联最大的汽车工厂之一，出产有名的胜利牌小轿车和“加兹五一”式载重汽车。据真理报报道：这个厂的生产成本降低得非常显著。和一九四九年相比，胜利牌轿车今年头四个月的成本，降低了百分之四十九点三，“加兹五一”式汽车降低了百分之四十二点七。从第五个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）开始实施到今年四月止，该厂仅超计划节约一项就有三千七百万卢布。以一九四八年生产一部“加兹五一”式汽车的时间，今年第一季可以出产两部；生产胜利牌轿车的工作时间也减低了百分之二十八。
    莫洛托夫汽车工厂降低成本的工作已经成为该厂的群众性运动之一。该厂所有主要车间和辅助车间，乃至供应和销售等管理部门的人员，都参加了这个运动。全厂工作人员在运动中积极发挥创造和革新热情，并采取了推广技术革新和节约原材料的许多有效措施。现在，全厂拥有不少节约达一百万卢布的工人。在这次五年计划内，工人们提出有关降低成本的重要发明和革新建议，已达五万五千多件。
    该厂的实际经验证明：要把数量众多的各部门和全体工人组织到降低成本的活动中，必须有系统地执行经济核算制。该厂执行经济核算制的组织准备工作很细致深入，详细订立了各种核算制度、测量办法和定额指标。每个车间都有关于提高劳动生产率、降低原料消耗的计划任务。这些制度的中心目的是促进各部门去发掘生产中的节约方法，减少非生产的消耗。其次，该厂不仅每个车间，而且车间内部的各个工段都同样实行了经济核算。凡是属于工段内的构成产品成本的各项因素都由工段负责。这样就使工段领班不仅是技术方面的领导，而且也是实行节约的领导。此外，该厂还实行了个人的和生产组的经济核算，这是保证每个工人都参加超计划节约的群众性的形式。去年一年，实行个人和生产组经济核算的工人，共节约一千五百万卢布。
    为保证降低成本计划的顺利实施，该厂很重视提高工人的经济知识水平。厂内已专门创办了“经济学校”，教授工人有关生产节约的经济知识。已有一万三千七百个工人先后在“经济学校”学习。
