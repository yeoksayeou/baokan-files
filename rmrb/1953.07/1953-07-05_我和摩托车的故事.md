My Story with Motorcycles
        Zhang Xinyi

	In July 1950, I was a soldier in a certain regiment. The company decided to transfer me to the general team's motorcycle training class for study. Before I left, the instructor said to me: "Comrade Zhang Xinyi, this time you are going to learn to drive a motorcycle, which means learning to master modern military technology. You must study hard. The conditions for the general team to transfer students this time are very strict, and the leadership decided to send you. Speaking of which, you are short of one condition, that is, you have little education, but you are young and have a good memory, and you are not afraid of difficulties. The leadership hopes you will complete the study task!" I said: "Okay, please rest assured, instructor, if others can learn it, so can I!" At that time, I didn't expect that learning machinery without education would have so many difficulties.

	The next day I arrived at the motorcycle training class. Among the more than forty students in the class, only I and two others had the lowest level of education. In class, the instructor drove in a three-wheeled motorcycle. I thought: "This thing is not difficult to drive. I can ride a bicycle with two wheels very fast, so isn't three wheels even easier? As long as I learn to move the buttons, I will immediately become a motorcyclist!"

	But things weren't that simple. After the instructor finished talking about the motorcycle's speed, maintenance, and its role in military operations and security, he immediately talked about the principles of the machine parts, and proposed: "Three points driving, seven points repair." A driver who cannot troubleshoot is equivalent to not knowing how to drive. As soon as I heard this, I was dumbfounded.

	The instructor disassembled the parts while explaining. The blackboard was filled with mechanical terms, such as "gearbox," "clutch," "mixed gas," etc., and my brain was always confused. Sometimes it's called "gearbox," sometimes it's called "gear housing," and sometimes it's called "gear speed box." In the end, I couldn't remember anything.

	I was so anxious that I was sweating. I thought: The higher-ups sent me here to study. If I can't learn it, how can I face the instructor when I go back, how can I complete the new task? The instructor asked the comrades in the group to help me learn culture. At first, I learned ten characters a day, and only remembered thirty-five characters in the first week. I said to the group leader, Wang Wen: "Don't just teach, please help me copy a notebook, and I'll look at it after my culture improves!"

	A month and a half of study passed. During the final test, driving - 65 points; disassembly - 48 points; inspection - 25 points. My grades were the worst. Comrade Wang Wen gave me a copy of his notes, and I packed it securely in my saddlebag.

	After the training class ended, the organization transferred me to the motorcycle company to work.

	The first time I received a task, the company commander ordered me to drive a motorcycle to inspect duty with the operations section chief. The section chief gave the route and asked me to return to the garrison within an hour. I agreed.

	After driving for five miles, suddenly a burst of "tut-tut-tut..." The motorcycle broke down. I jumped out of the car and removed the cover plate. After checking: the oil circuit and wiring were normal; the machine parts and screws were also fine, but it just wouldn't start. I was so anxious that I was covered in sweat. I checked for forty-five minutes, but still couldn't find the cause. The section chief saw that there was no hope and had to walk away. In the end, I had no choice but to borrow a rope from a fellow villager, pull the motorcycle back to the company, and report it to the deputy company commander.

	After the deputy company commander checked the machine parts, he smiled and said, "It's not a big problem. The bakelite at the joint of the high-voltage wire is cracked, just wrap it with a piece of tape." After repair, it was indeed able to run. The deputy company commander said: "Comrade Zhang Xinyi, didn't you learn how to troubleshoot general faults?" I said: "I probably learned it, but I don't remember it very well." "If you don't remember it clearly, it won't work. It will be difficult to complete the task if you continue like this." The deputy company commander criticized me seriously. I felt very ashamed and really realized the difficulty of mastering modern military technology without education.

	Soon, the company started cultural studies. From May 1952 to January 1953, I had already become a student who had improved from illiteracy to nearly a high school graduate level.

	One day, I suddenly remembered the notebook that Comrade Wang Wen had copied for me. I found it and opened it, and I was so happy that I jumped up. The names of the machine parts that I had forgotten were now clearly jumping into my eyes. Turning to page ten, it said "Faults Caused by Bakelite Cracks." These words suddenly startled me. Looking down, it was exactly talking about the root cause of the last failure to complete the task. I immediately felt that this notebook had become my priceless treasure, so I read it over and over again.

	On March 9th this year, I was ordered to drive a motorcycle with the operations staff to carry out an urgent task. When the car reached Xizhimen, it suddenly broke down again. The staff was afraid of delaying the work, so he immediately went to a store to make a phone call to negotiate for a car. After carefully checking the machine parts, I found a layer of black smoke on the "platinum contact point." I immediately thought of a note in the notebook that talked about this problem. The method of repair was to wipe off the black smoke and adjust the gap. According to this method, I wrapped a piece of paper around it, wiped off the black smoke on the platinum contact point, and adjusted the gap appropriately. In less than ten minutes, the car was able to start immediately. When the staff came back and saw it, he was very happy. He went back and made another phone call to the company headquarters, explained the situation, and then we went to work smoothly.

	In the evening, when I returned to the company headquarters, the deputy company commander greeted me with a smile. I said, "Report to the Deputy Company Commander, the mission has been successfully completed!" The deputy company commander said, "How did you learn to repair it?" I took out my notebook and replied, "Relying on it, relying on us having culture!"

    我和摩托车的故事
    张新义
    一九五○年七月，我正在某团当战士，连里决定调我去总队摩托训练班学习。临走，指导员对我说：“张新义同志，这次你去学习开摩托，就是学习掌握现代化军事技术，你一定要认真学习。这次总队调学员的条件很严格，领导上决定派你去。说起来你还差一个条件，没点文化，可是你年轻记性好，不怕困难，领导上希望你完成学习任务！”我说：“好，请指导员放心，别人能学会，咱也能学会！”当时可就没想到没有文化学习机械有许多困难。
    第二天我到了摩托训练班。全班四十多个学员中，只有我和另外两个人文化程度最低。上课的时候，教员开来了一架三个轮子的摩托。我想：“这玩艺儿不难开，自行车两个轱辘我可以骑着飞跑，三个轱辘不是更没问题吗？只要学会搬动机纽，马上就成了摩托手啦！”
    原来事情不是这样简单。教员讲完了摩托车的行速、保养和在军用作战警备方面的作用之后，紧接着就讲机件原理，并且提出：“三分驾驶七分修理”，驾驶员不会排除故障就等于不会开车。——这一听，我就傻眼了。
    教员一面分解零件，一面讲解。黑板上写了许多机械名词，什么“变速箱”、“离合器”、“混合瓦斯”……等等名称，脑瓜子总是纠缠不清。一会叫“变速箱”，一会叫“变住箱”，一会又叫“变度箱”，到后来竟是什么也没记住。
    我急得直冒火，心想：上级派咱来学习，学不会回去后怎么见指导员，怎么完成新任务。教员让组里同志们帮助我学文化。起初每天学十个字，第一个星期只记住三十五个字。我对小组长王文说：“你别只管教，请帮我抄本笔记吧，等文化提高了再看！”
    一个半月的学习过去了，终结测验时，驾驶—六十五分；分解—四十八分；修检—二十五分，我的成绩最差。王文同志送给我一份笔记，我把它严严实实地装在挂包里。
    训练班结束以后，组织上把我调到摩托连工作。
    第一次接受任务，是连长命令我驾驶摩托，同作战科长一块去检查勤务。科长指示了路线。让我在一小时内返回驻地。我答应了。
    车行了五里路，突然一阵“突—突—突……”摩托出了故障。我跳下车来，卸开了盖板。一检查：油路、线路正常；机件螺丝也没有毛病，就是再也开不走了。我急得出了满身大汗，检查了四十五分钟，仍是找不出原因来。科长看着无希望，只好步行走了。末了，实在没办法，我只好借了老乡一条绳子，把摩托车拉回连部，并报告给副连长。
    副连长检查过机件以后，笑了笑说：“没大毛病，高压线接合部的电木裂了，包上块胶布就行了。”经过修理，果然能开了。副连长说：“张新义同志，排除一般的故障你不是学过吗？”我说：“大概学过，记不太清了。”“记不清还行吗？这样下去就很难完成任务。”副连长严肃地批评了我。我感到非常惭愧，并且确实体会到没有文化掌握现代化军事技术的困难。
    不久，连里开始了文化学习。从一九五二年五月到一九五三年一月，我已经是一个由文盲提高到接近高小毕业程度的学员了。
    一天，我突然想起了王文同志给我抄的笔记本，找出来打开一看，我乐得直跳。原来我早已忘了的机件名称，现在都清清楚楚地跳进我的眼睛里来。翻到第十页，上面写着“电木破裂引起的故障”。这几个字突地吓我一跳。看下去，正是讲的上次没有完成任务的病根。我马上觉得这本笔记成了我的无价宝，于是翻来覆去地阅读。
    今年三月九号，我奉令驾驶摩托同作战参谋去执行紧要任务。车行至西直门，突然又发生了故障。参谋怕耽误工作，马上到商店里去挂电话，交涉要车。我仔细地检查了机件以后，发现“白金接触点”部位熏上了一层黑烟。我立刻想到笔记本上有一条是讲到这个问题的，修理的方法是擦去黑烟，调整间隙。按照这个方法，我缠好了一片纸，擦净白金接触点上的黑烟，适当调整了间隙。没用十分钟，车子马上能开动了。参谋回来一看，心里很高兴，返回去又给连部打了一次电话，说明情况之后，我们就顺利地去进行工作。
    晚上，回到连部的时候，副连长笑着迎出来。我说：“报告副连长，胜利完成任务！”副连长说：“你怎么会修理了？”我一面掏出了笔记本，一面回答说：“凭着它，凭着咱有了文化！”
