    Moscow Stores Strive to Meet People's Needs (Part 1)
    Li He
    I recently walked around the streets of Moscow and found that the number of shops in Moscow, the quantity and variety of goods in the shops, have greatly increased, the quality and styles have been greatly improved, and the purchasing power and needs of customers have also greatly increased. I noticed that this situation started after the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it has been particularly significant since the sixth postwar reduction of prices in the Soviet Union.
    In Moscow, as in other cities in the Soviet Union, it can be seen that the trade network is composed of three trade systems: state-owned stores, cooperative-run stores, and collective farm markets, and state-owned commerce is the largest and most numerous longitude and latitude line in the trade network. Moscow is the most populous Soviet capital, so the trading characteristics of this socialist city are even more prominent.
    There are dozens of permanent collective farm markets in Moscow (and five more will be added soon). There are also temporary fairs. In the turn of spring and summer this year, fairs were held in the suburbs of Moscow, which played a significant role in promoting the exchange of products between urban and rural areas. At the permanent markets and temporary fairs, collective farms and collective farmers mainly sell their surplus agricultural products. State-owned and cooperative-run stores also promote industrial products needed by farmers there. The collective farm market is composed of large glass-roofed pavilions, corridor-style sheds, warehouses, storage rooms, etc. These facilities, refrigerators, and scales belong to the market and are rented out by the market. The market also helps collective farms transport agricultural products, and the collective farms guarantee to sell a certain amount of agricultural products in the market. The agricultural products in the market not only come from collective farms in Moscow, but also from collective farms in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and other places. Fresh milk, dairy products, meat, poultry, eggs, flour, honey, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural products can be bought in the market. Recently, cherries and strawberries from collective farms in Ukraine and the Caucasus have arrived in the market, and are sold by the tons every day. The prices of agricultural products in the market are higher than in the shops. The goods in the shops are sold at prescribed prices, while the agricultural products in the market are sold at prices formed according to demand relationships.
    Moscow has various shops run by cooperatives. Some sewing shops, barber shops, and repair shops are run by handicraft cooperatives. Some fish and meat shops, meat, egg and poultry shops, fruit and vegetable shops, mushroom and berry shops, clothing and shirt shops, leather bag and hat shops, haberdashery shops, shoe shops, knitwear shops, chemical shops, furniture shops, and tableware shops are run by consumer cooperatives. The main trade network of Soviet consumer cooperatives is located in rural areas, focusing on serving rural residents. Cooperative shops, stores, stalls, and kiosks sell handicrafts and agricultural products; because cooperatives can purchase some raw materials such as hemp and wool, as well as dairy products, meat, vegetables, and other agricultural products from collective farms and farmers who have fulfilled their obligations to the state and state procurement plans.
    The vast majority of shops in Moscow that supply residents with food and daily necessities are state-owned. Many large shops are specially built, and more shops are opened on the first floors of buildings facing the street. One hundred and twenty-six large shops and twenty-four canteens have been opened on the first floors of buildings newly built in Moscow in the past two years, and seventy shops and seventeen canteens will be opened this year. A total of three hundred and fifty shops and one hundred and twenty-five canteens, cafes, and restaurants will be set up during this five-year plan. Last year, several hundred small shops were merged into one hundred and forty-five large specialized shops, and nearly one hundred small shops will be merged this year.
    The food trade network is very dense. Various shops that supply food are close to buyers. Moscow residents can buy the food they need everywhere. There are specialized bakeries, meat shops, fish shops, milk shops, fruit and vegetable shops, tobacco shops, and liquor stores everywhere; there are shops that sell bread and sweets together, fish, meat and vegetables together, and tobacco and alcohol together; there are grocery stores that sell a variety of foods; there are food department stores - "delicatessens". The largest "delicatessen" in the Soviet Union will be opened in the "Uprising Square" building. Food department stores and grocery stores are located on the streets, complementing bakeries, fish and meat shops, etc.
    The quantity and variety of food for Moscow residents are constantly increasing, and the quality is constantly improving. Compared to 1950, Muscovites ate 91 percent more meat products, 82 percent more oil, and 23 percent more fish last year. Compared to April of this year, they ate 34.5 percent more meat and poultry, 40 percent more sausages, and 24.5 percent more oil than in April of last year. Last year, the consumption of wheat flour bread accounted for 70 percent of all bread, while it only accounted for 50 percent before the war. In bakeries, there are as many as 35 to 40 kinds of baked goods such as bagels. Bread factories add vitamins when making white bread.
    The industrial products trade network is even denser. There are five or six hundred daily necessities shops in the city. There are specialized clothing stores, fabric stores, haberdashery stores (selling needles, threads, lace, ties, women's handbags, etc.), shoe stores, and furniture stores. There are mixed clothing, shoe, hat, and haberdashery stores, knitwear, haberdashery, and cosmetics stores, women's clothing stores, and children's goods stores. There are also many shops that supply cultural and recreational products; there are school stationery stores, sports equipment stores, photographic equipment and radio equipment stores, music instrument stores, children's toy stores, and art goods stores. There are pharmacies that sell medicines, medical equipment, and cosmetics. The most attractive to buyers are department stores. There are several department stores in Moscow, with the Central Department Store in the central area, and other large department stores in other districts. In addition, four large department stores are being built, one of which is three or four times the size of the Central Department Store.
    The industrial products consumed by Moscow residents have undergone tremendous development in quantity, variety, and quality. Compared to 1950, Muscovites bought 58 percent more silk fabrics, 45 percent more knitwear, and 39 percent more sewn products last year. Compared to April of this year, they bought 20 percent more wool fabrics, 38 percent more sewn products, and 36.5 percent more knitwear than in April of last year. Taking textiles alone, there are now forty-six specialized shops supplying residents with various kinds of silk and cotton fabrics, six of which have attached tailoring departments. There is a fashion exhibition hall on Kuznetsky Most Street, displaying various styles of clothing for men, women, and children. Muscovites are very particular about clothing styles. Many of their clothes are not bought ready-made but made to order. There are more than four hundred sewing shops in Moscow. The sewing shops belonging to the "Moscow Individual Clothing" Trust accept 500,000 orders every year. This year, the orders accepted will be 40 percent more than last year. This trust has a fashion design organization, employing more than three hundred top-notch clothing technicians to participate. Seven hundred styles of men's and women's fashions were designed for this spring and summer.
    Since July 1, more than 12,000 large and small trade and public catering enterprises in Moscow have extended their service hours for residents. General food stores are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Among them, food department stores, snack shops, liquor and soda shops, tobacco shops, fruit shops, and canned food shops are open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Seven hundred duty food stores are open from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and some work around the clock. Specialized shops selling clothing, fabrics, shoes, haberdashery, household goods, furniture, stationery, electrical equipment, chemicals, and sports equipment are open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and are also open on rest days. Department stores are also open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and are closed on Mondays. Small retail networks selling food are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and those selling industrial products are open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Canteens are open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and duty canteens are open from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. On the first day of extended service hours, the Central Department Store had 120,000 buyers, and the trade volume increased by hundreds of thousands of rubles.
    A characteristic of Moscow's trade network is the large number of bookstores. These bookstores that supply residents with spiritual food are often lined up side by side with shops that supply residents with material food. There are more than eighty bookstores and more than two hundred newspaper kiosks in the city. Some bookstores sell books in all categories, and some sell specialized books, such as technology, medicine, etc. There is a bookstore on Kuznetsky Most Street that specializes in selling books published in foreign languages, and there is a bookstore on Gorky Street that specializes in selling children's books. There are also second-hand bookstores that sell second-hand books. In addition, several fairs are held every year to promote books. Last year, residents of Moscow City and the Moscow Region bought about 55 million copies of political, scientific, technical, and literary books. Bookstores and newspaper kiosks in Moscow sell an average of 250,000 books every day.
    On the sidewalks of Moscow, you can find fixed newspaper kiosks, flower kiosks, medicine and cosmetics kiosks, clothing kiosks, and mobile ice cream carts, soda carts, fruit stalls, vegetable stalls, tobacco stalls, etc. There are also book kiosks, medicine and cosmetics kiosks, and soda stations in the upper outer hall of the subway. These lightweight and compact retail stalls are closer to buyers and assist shops in serving residents. They are all state-owned and cooperative-run, and have great flexibility and seasonality. This summer, the Moscow City Soviet and the Moscow Region Consumer Cooperative organized a very wide small retail network in parks and suburban recreation areas.
    This is the general picture of Moscow stores as I know it.

    努力满足人民需要的莫斯科商店（上）
    李何
    我最近到莫斯科街上走走，发现莫斯科商店的数目、商店里货物的数量和品种大大增加了，质量和样式大大改进了，顾客的购买力和需要也大大提高了。我注意到这种情形从苏联共产党第十九次代表大会后就已经开始，而苏联战后第六次减低物价以来特别显著。
    在莫斯科，和在苏联其他城市一样，可以看到，贸易网是由国营商店、合作社经营的商店和集体农庄的市场三种贸易系统构成的，而国营商业是贸易网中最大最多的经纬线。莫斯科是居民最多的苏联首都，所以这个社会主义社会的城市贸易特点也更突出。
    莫斯科市经常性的集体农庄的市场有几十个（不久还要添设五个）。还有临时性的市集。在今年春夏之交，莫斯科市郊举办过市集，它们对于促进城乡产品的交流起了不小作用。在经常性的市场和临时性的市集上，主要是集体农庄和集体农民出售他们剩余的农产品。在那里国营和合作社经营的商店也推销农民所需要的工业品。集体农庄的市场是由玻璃顶的大亭子、走廊式的棚台、仓库、贮藏室等等组成的。这些设备、冷藏器、秤都属于市场，由市场出租。市场还帮助集体农庄运输农产品，集体农庄则保证在市场上出售一定数量的农产品。市场上的农产品不但来自莫斯科的集体农庄，也来自乌克兰、高加索等地的集体农庄。市场上可以买到新鲜的牛乳、乳制品、肉类、家禽、鸡蛋、面粉、蜂蜜、蔬菜、水果等农产品。最近市场新到了从乌克兰、高加索集体农庄来的樱桃和草莓，每天成吨地销售出去。市场上的农产品价格比商店要高些。商店里的货物是按规定的价格出售的，而市场上的农产品却按照需求关系所形成的价格出售。
    莫斯科市有合作社经营的各种商店。有些缝纫店、理发店、修理店是由手工业者合作社经营的。有些鱼和肉店、肉类和鸡蛋和家禽店、水果和蔬菜店、蘑菇和莓果店、服装和衬衣店、皮袋和帽子店、服饰杂货店、鞋店、针织品店、化学品店、家具店、食具店，是由消费合作社经营的。苏联消费合作社的主要贸易网设在农村，集中力量为农村居民服务。合作社的店、铺、摊、亭出售着手工业产品，也出售着农产品；因为合作社可以在已完成对国家的义务和国家采购计划的集体农庄和农民手中收购一些麻、毛等原料和乳制品、肉类、蔬菜等农产品。
    在莫斯科供给居民以食品和日用必需品的绝大多数商店是国营的。许多大的商店是专门建筑的，更多的商店开设在朝街房屋的第一层里。两年来在莫斯科新建的房屋的第一层，开设了一百二十六个大商店和二十四个食堂，今年将开设七十个商店和十七个食堂，在这个五年计划内总共将设三百五十个商店和一百二十五个食堂、咖啡馆和饭馆。去年有几百个小商店合并成一百四十五个大的专业化商店，今年还有近百个小商店合并。
    食品贸易网很密。各种供给食品的商店靠近着购买者。莫斯科居民随处可以买到所需的食品。到处有专业化的面包店、肉店、鱼店、牛乳店、蔬菜水果店、烟店、酒店；有把面包和糖果合在一起、鱼和肉和蔬菜合在一起、烟和酒合在一起经售的商店；有经售多种食品的食品杂货店；有食品百货店——“美食店”。在“起义广场”大厦中将开设全苏联最大的“美食店”。食品百货店和食品杂货店设在大街上，它和面包店、鱼肉店等互相补充。
    莫斯科居民食品的数量、品种不断增加，质量不断地提高。以去年比一九五零年，莫斯科人多吃肉制品百分之九十一，油脂百分之八十二，鱼百分之二十三。以今年四月比去年四月，多吃了肉类和家禽百分之三十四点五，香肠百分之四十，油脂百分之二十四点五。去年小麦粉面包的消费量占全部面包的百分之七十，而战前只占百分之五十。在面包店里，面包圈等烤面制品多至三十五种到四十种。面包厂在制造白面包时加进了维他命。
    工业品贸易网更密。全市开设着五六百个日用必需品商店。有专业化的服装店、布匹店、服饰店
    （卖针线、花边、领带、女用提包等等）、鞋店、家具店。有混合经营的衣着、鞋帽和服饰品商店，针织品、服饰品和化妆品商店，女用服装品商店，儿童用品商店。供给文娱用品的商店也不少；有学校文具店、运动器具店、照像器材和无线电器材店、乐器店、儿童玩具店、艺术品店。有经售药品、医疗用具和化妆品的药房。吸引着购买者最多的是百货商店。莫斯科市有好些百货商店，在中心区有中央百货商店，其他区也有很大的百货商店。此外，还正在建筑四个大百货商店，其中一个有中央百货商店三、四倍大。
    莫斯科居民所消费的工业品，在数量、品种和质量上都有巨大的发展。以去年比一九五零年，莫斯科人多买了百分之五十八丝织品、百分之四十五针织品、百分之三十九缝纫品。以今年四月比去年四月，多买了百分之二十毛织品，百分之三十八缝纫品，百分之三十六点五针织品。仅以纺织品来说，现有四十六个专业化的商店供应居民各种各色的丝织品和棉织品，其中六个商店附设着代裁部。在铁匠桥街上有时装展览所，陈列着男女和儿童的各式时装，莫斯科人很讲究服装样式。他们的许多服装都不是买现成的而是定做的。莫斯科有四百多个缝纫店。属于“莫斯科单人服装”托辣斯的缝纫店每年接受五十万件定货。今年接受的定货将比去年多百分之四十。这个托辣斯设有设计时装的机构，聘请三百多个头等成衣技术人员参加。今年春夏季设计了七百种男女时装样式。
    自七月一日起莫斯科一万二千多个贸易和公共饮食的大小企业延长为居民服务的时间。一般食品店从上午七点开到下午八点。其中食品百货店、点心店、酒和汽水店、香烟店、水果店、罐头店从上午九点开到下午十点。七百个值班的食品店从上午九点开到晚间十二点，有的昼夜工作。经售服装、布匹、鞋、服饰、家庭用具、家具、文具、电气器材、化学品、运动器具的专业化商店从上午九点开到下午九点，休息日也开市。百货商店也是从上午九点开到下午九点，星期一休息。小零售网经售食品的从上午八点开到下午八点，经售工业品的从上午九点到下午八点。食堂从上午九点开到下午九点，值班食堂从上午七点到晚间十二点。延长服务的第一天，中央百货商店购买者达十二万人，贸易额增加几十万卢布。
    莫斯科贸易网的一个特色是书店多。这些供给居民以精神食粮的书店常常和供给居民以物质食粮的商店并肩排列着。全市有八十多个书店和二百多个书亭。有的书店经售各门书籍，有的经售专门书籍，如技术、医学等。铁匠桥街上有专门经售用外国文出版的书籍的书店，高尔基大街上有专门经售儿童书籍的书店。还有代售旧书的旧书店。此外，每年还举行几次推销书籍的市集。去年莫斯科市和州的居民买了约五千五百万册政治、科学、技术、文学书籍。莫斯科市的书店和书亭平均每天售出二十五万册书籍。
    在莫斯科行人道上可以遇到固定的书报亭、花亭、药品化妆品亭、服饰亭，和活动的冰琪淋车子、汽水车子、水果摊子、蔬菜摊子、香烟摊子等。在地下铁道上层外厅也设着书亭、药品化妆品亭、汽水台。这种轻便小巧的零售摊亭更接近购买者，辅助着商店为居民服务，它们都是国营和合作社经营的，有很大的伸缩性和季节性。今年夏天莫斯科市苏维埃和莫斯科州消费合作社在公园和郊外休息地方组织了很广的小零售网。
    这就是我所知道的莫斯科商店的一般面貌。
