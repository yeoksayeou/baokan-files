    Central Ministry of Foreign Trade and Affiliated Professional Companies
    Over 3,000 Cadres Participate in "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" Study

    The Central People's Government Ministry of Foreign Trade and its affiliated professional companies have begun studying the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." A total of 3,254 people are participating in this study. The Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, based on the "Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954" and the plan of the Work Committee of the Organs Directly Under the Central People's Government on the theoretical study of cadres, discussed the issue of the ministry's cadre theoretical study and made specific regulations. On the morning of the 11th of this month, Li Zheren, Vice Minister of the ministry, gave a mobilization report to all cadres participating in the study. Vice Minister Li first pointed out that the enthusiasm of cadres in various units of the Ministry of Foreign Trade for study in the first half of the year was very high, and they had gained a lot, but there was a problem of being tight at the beginning and slackening later in leadership, and similar situations must be prevented in the future. He then briefly described the main points of study for each chapter from Chapter Nine to Chapter Twelve of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," and gave a detailed explanation of the purpose, requirements, and important significance of this study.

    At the same time, he also talked about the Soviet Union's methods of building socialism, the issue of funds, especially the issue of cadres. He said that attaching importance to talent and cadres is one of the important experiences of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. As Comrade Stalin said, "Cadres decide everything." To meet the needs of the high tide of national construction, we need many cadres who understand the theory of socialist economic construction and are proficient in business. This requires us to intensify our study and improve our knowledge level. He called on all cadres, especially when the motherland is entering a large-scale economic construction, to be more strict with themselves to learn new things that they do not know and do not understand, and on the basis of existing revolutionary experience and knowledge, to learn the skills of economic construction and become the backbone force on the economic construction front, so as to play a greater role in the economic construction of the motherland. He also called on all Communist Party members of the ministry to play an exemplary role in the study of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)."

    Vice Minister Li also gave some important instructions on learning attitude and learning methods, and criticized the erroneous views of some cadres who undervalued theoretical study and the dependent thinking of simply waiting for theoretical teachers to give lectures. He said: Theoretical teachers can only play a guiding role in learning, but cannot replace one's own learning. Therefore, he emphasized that in future study, we must defeat two enemies—laziness and complacency; we must use our brains, connect with reality, and understand the position, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism in solving problems.

    In order to ensure the successful completion of the study task, the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade decided that the senior group would be directly led by the Party Leadership Group; the middle-level group would be led by the Party Committee. The senior group will focus on self-study supplemented by discussion; the middle-level group will adopt a method that combines self-study, discussion, and lectures, and the Party Committee will invite comrades participating in the senior group to give large lectures to the middle-level group.

    In order to assist and promote learning, the Party Leadership Group also decided to publish an irregular learning newsletter to exchange learning experiences and conduct commendations and criticisms. (Mi Xinzhi)

    中央对外贸易部及所属各专业公司
    三千余干部参加“联共（布）党史”学习
    中央人民政府对外贸易部及其所属各专业公司已开始进行“联共（布）党史”的学习。参加这次学习的共有三千二百五十四人。对外贸易部党组根据“中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”以及中共中央人民政府直属机关委员会关于干部理论学习的计划，结合本部情况，讨论了该部干部理论学习的问题，并作出了具体的规定。本月十一日上午，该部李哲人副部长向参加学习的全体干部作了动员报告。李副部长首先指出，上半年对外贸易部各单位干部学习的积极性是很高的，有了不少的收获，但在领导上却有前紧后松的毛病，今后必须防止类似情形发生。接着他简述了“联共（布）党史”第九章到十二章每章的学习重点，并对这一次学习的目的、要求和重要意义作了详尽的说明。
    同时还讲述了苏联建设社会主义的方法问题，资金问题，特别是干部问题。他说，重视人材、干部是苏联共产党的重要经验之一，正如斯大林同志所说“干部决定一切”，为适应祖国建设高潮的需要，我们需要有许多懂得社会主义经济建设理论和精通业务的干部，这就需要我们加紧学习，提高自己的知识水平。他号召全体干部，特别是在祖国转入大规模经济建设当中，要更加严格要求自己去学会不知道和不懂得的新鲜事物，在已有的革命经验和知识的基础上，学会经济建设的本领，成为经济建设战线上的中坚力量，以便能够对祖国的经济建设发挥更大作用，他还号召该部全体共产党员要在“联共（布）党史”的学习中起模范作用。
    李副部长还对学习态度和学习方法作了若干重要指示，批判了某些干部轻视理论学习的错误观点和单纯等待理论教员上课的依赖思想。他说：理论教员只能起辅导学习的作用，而不能代替自己学习。因此，他强调指出在今后学习中，必须打倒两个敌人——懒惰和自满；必须开动脑筋，联系实际，领会马克思列宁主义解决问题的立场、观点和方法。
    对外贸易部党组为保证学习任务的胜利完成，决定高级组由党组直接领导；中级组由党委会领导。高级组以自学为主讨论为辅；中级组采用自学、讨论、上课三者并重的方法，由党委会约请参加高级组的同志给中级组上大课。
    为辅助和推动学习，党组还决定出刊一种不定期的活页的学习小报，以交流学习心得和经验，并进行表扬与批评。（米心之）
