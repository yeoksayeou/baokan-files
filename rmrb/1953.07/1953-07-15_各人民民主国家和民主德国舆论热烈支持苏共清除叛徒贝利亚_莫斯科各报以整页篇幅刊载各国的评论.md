Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The public opinion in Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the German Democratic Republic attaches great importance to the decision of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's anti-Party and anti-state conspiracy. Newspapers in various countries have published relevant news and editorials, and reported on the rallies held by working people in various places to support the Soviet people's victorious struggle against Beria, the enemy of the Party and the state.

Many newspapers in Poland have published editorials on Beria's crimes. The "People's Tribune," the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, published an editorial stating: The exposure and liquidation of the anti-Party and anti-state crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Soviet people, is a heavy blow to the reactionary forces of imperialism. It further consolidates the strength of the Soviet Communist Party and the camp of peace and socialism. The Polish people have always regarded the Soviet Union as an indestructible socialist fortress and a reliable pillar of all progressive mankind. The Polish United Workers' Party believes that the Soviet Communist Party and its Central Committee are the embodiment of the historical experience of the international workers' movement and the experience of victorious socialist construction, and the embodiment of the brilliant theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Our Polish United Workers' Party, together with the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world, expresses fraternal support to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, and great satisfaction at the timely exposure and liquidation of the criminal sabotage activities of Beria, the enemy of the people.

All central-level newspapers in Czechoslovakia published the decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the resolutions of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The "Red Right Newspaper," the organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, stated in its editorial: The Czechoslovak people express their deepest respect for the Soviet Communist Party's resolute elimination of the hostile activities of the agents of imperialism, and express righteous anger at Beria's despicable betrayal. The Czechoslovak people believe that the resolute liquidation of Beria's conspiracy is a manifestation of the ever-increasing strength of the peace-loving Soviet Union, and it once again sends a warning to imperialism that any anti-Soviet conspiracy is bound to fail. The Communist Party members of Czechoslovakia, like their comrades in the Soviet Union, must enhance their vigilance and comprehensively improve the Party's political and ideological work and its connection with the masses.

Hungary's "Free People's Newspaper" reported on the rallies held by the working people to denounce Beria's betrayal. At a rally of workers at a machine tool and metal products factory, foreman Laszlo Suda of the planer workshop said: "For us, the Beria incident is a wake-up call. Like the Soviet people, we must more vigilantly protect our achievements and be ready to respond with powerful blows to any provocation by the enemies who threaten our freedom, our peace, and our creative labor." Members of the "Chervenkof Cooperative" in Yurem Village also held a meeting to condemn Beria's criminal activities with indignation. Speakers at the meeting said that the enemy of the Soviet people is also our enemy. Whoever opposes the Soviet state and the Soviet Communist Party is also infringing upon our freedom. The Hungarian working peasants and all working people are advancing with full confidence together with the world's first socialist country—the great Soviet Union.

Romania's "Spark Newspaper" and "Free Romania Newspaper" both published editorials commenting on the decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The "Spark Newspaper's" editorial pointed out the great significance of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet Presidium's decision to purge the traitor Beria for intensifying communist construction. The editorial stated: While indignantly denouncing the traitor Beria, the Romanian people express their warm welcome to the correct and resolute measures taken by the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet Presidium. On this incident, our Workers' Party members and all working people have once again seen how the glorious Soviet Communist Party and its Central Committee of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government are defending the cause of peace with such high vigilance, and how they are unswervingly struggling to build a communist society.

Bulgarian newspapers also attached great importance to the decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's crimes. The Bulgarian Communist Party organ "Workers' Cause Newspaper" reprinted the July 11th editorial of the Soviet "Truth Newspaper" and TASS news about party organizations and laboring people throughout the Soviet Union denouncing Beria's crimes, under the title "The Whole Party, the Entire Soviet People Unanimously Support the Decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union". Various newspapers also carried the statement of the Presidium of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union.

Albania's "People's Voice Newspaper" published an editorial saying: The liquidation of Beria's treasonous crimes once again proves the great strength of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people. Under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the Albanian Labor Party will further strengthen the unity of its ranks. Due to the consolidation of our democratic system, the unity of the people, the increase in revolutionary vigilance, and the strengthening of our love for the Soviet people, any conspiracy of imperialism against Albania is bound to fail.

In the German Democratic Republic, the "New Germany Newspaper," "Youth World Newspaper," "Forum Newspaper," and "Berlin Daily Newspaper" all published the decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's crimes. Various newspapers also reprinted the full text of the Soviet "Truth Newspaper" editorial of July 10th. The "New Germany Newspaper" also published the news of the joint plenary meeting of the Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Soviet Communist Party condemning Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th: The Korean "Labor News" and "Democratic Korea Daily" published the news of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes. The newspapers also prominently reprinted the Soviet "Truth Newspaper's" July 10th editorial: "The Indestructible Unity of the Party, the Government, and the Soviet People."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: Moscow newspapers continued to report on July 14th that Party committees and working people in various parts of the Soviet Union held plenary meetings and rallies to discuss the decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's crimes. The newspapers also published full-page coverage of comments from the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the German Democratic Republic, as well as the United States, Britain, France, Italy, India, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, and Finland on the decisions of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The reaction of the People's Republic of China was the longest and was placed in the first article. TASS, in its Beijing dispatch of July 13th, said: "Chinese newspapers are paying great attention to the exposure of Beria's criminal anti-Party and anti-state activities, pointing out that this exposure is the strengthening of the power and prestige of the Soviet state." TASS reported on the publication situation in the newspapers of the Chinese capital and the summary of the Beijing "People's Daily" editorial "The Unity and Consolidation of the Soviet Communist Party is in the Interests of the Working People of the World." TASS reported from Shanghai on July 13th on the publication situation in Shanghai newspapers, saying: "Shanghai public opinion and newspapers evaluate the exposure of Beria's crimes and the resolute actions of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet as a factor in strengthening the power and prestige of the Soviet state." TASS extracted the comments of Shanghai's "Wenhui Daily" and "News Daily."

The "News" newspaper also published an editorial on July 14th, calling on Communist Party members and all working people to enhance revolutionary vigilance, saying that facts have proven that international reactionary forces are becoming increasingly rampant, and the spies they send to democratic camp countries are also becoming increasingly rampant. The incident of Beria, the despicable degenerate and traitor, the enemy of the Party and the people, and the agent of international imperialism, proves this point. Vigilance must be maintained in all aspects and in all circumstances. We must remember that paralysis, complacency, and credulity will create conditions for the hostile and destructive activities of imperialist agents. "News" also said that the decisions of the Central Committee Plenum of the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have been unanimously supported by brotherly workers' parties, communist parties, and progressive people in various countries. Newspapers of fraternal Communist and Workers' parties pointed out that political lessons must be drawn from the Beria incident, and called for enhancing revolutionary vigilance, expanding ideological and political work among the masses, and strengthening ties with the masses. These newspapers also called for ruthlessly exposing and smashing the criminal activities of the hired agents of imperialism.

    各人民民主国家和民主德国舆论热烈支持苏共清除叛徒贝利亚
    莫斯科各报以整页篇幅刊载各国的评论
    【新华社十四日讯】东欧人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的舆论，十分重视苏联共产党中央全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚反党、反国家阴谋的决定。各国的报纸纷纷发表了有关的新闻和社论，并报道了各地劳动人民举行集会，支持苏联人民反对党和国家的敌人贝利亚的胜利斗争的情况。
    波兰的许多报纸都发表了关于贝利亚罪行的社论。波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”发表社论说：苏联人民的敌人贝利亚的反党、反国家罪行的被揭发和清算，是给予帝国主义反动势力的一个沉重的打击。它进一步巩固了苏联共产党及和平与社会主义阵营的力量。波兰人民一直认为苏联是一个不可摧毁的社会主义堡垒，是全体进步人类的可靠的支柱。波兰统一工人党认为苏联共产党和它的中央委员会，是国际工人运动的历史经验和胜利建设社会主义经验的化身，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的光辉学说的化身。我们波兰统一工人党，同全世界的共产党和工人党一道，对苏共中央表示兄弟般的支援，对人民的敌人贝利亚罪恶的破坏活动之及时被揭发和清算一事，表示极大的欣慰。
    捷克斯洛伐克所有中央一级报纸都刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决定和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议。捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”社论说：捷克斯洛伐克人民对苏联共产党如此坚决地消灭了帝国主义代理人的敌对活动，表示最深切的敬意，并对贝利亚卑鄙的叛变行为表示正义的愤怒。捷克斯洛伐克人民认为：坚决地清算贝利亚的阴谋活动，是爱好和平的苏联不断强大的表现，它再一次向帝国主义发出警告，任何的反苏阴谋都一定是要失败的。捷克斯洛伐克的共产党员也和苏联的同志们一样，要提高自己的警惕性，并且要全面地改进党的政治思想工作和联系群众的工作。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”报道了劳动人民集会痛斥贝利亚背叛行为的情况。在一个母机和金属品制造厂工人的集会上、刨床车间领班拉斯洛·素达尔发言说：“对于我们来说，贝利亚事件是一声警钟。我们要像苏联人民一样，更加警惕地保护我们的成就，随时准备以有力的打击，来回答任何威胁我们自由、威胁我们和平和创造性劳动的敌人的一切挑衅。”尤雷姆村“契尔文科夫合作社”社员也举行会议，愤慨地斥责贝利亚的罪恶活动。在会上发言的人说，苏联人民的敌人，也就是我们的敌人。谁要是反对苏维埃国家和苏联共产党，那他也就是侵犯我们的自由。匈牙利劳动农民和全体劳动人民满怀信心地和世界上第一个社会主义国家——伟大的苏联一道前进。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”和“自由罗马尼亚报”都发表社论，评论苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决定。“火花报”的社论指出了苏共中央和最高苏维埃主席团清除叛徒贝利亚的决定，对于加紧进行共产主义建设的重大意义。社论说：罗马尼亚人民在忿怒地痛斥叛徒贝利亚的同时，对苏共中央和苏联最高苏维埃主席团所采取的正确而坚决的措施，表示热烈的欢迎。我国工人党党员和全体劳动人民，在这一事件上又看到了：光荣的苏联共产党及其列宁、斯大林的中央委员会和苏联政府，是以怎样高度的警惕性捍卫着和平事业，和如何不屈不挠地为建设共产主义社会而奋斗。
    保加利亚报纸也很重视苏共中央全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚的罪行的决定。保加利亚共产党机关报“工人事业报”以“全党、全体苏联人民一致拥护苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决定”为标题，转载了七月十一日苏联“真理报”社论和塔斯社关于苏联各地党组织和劳动人民痛斥贝利亚罪行的消息。各报也刊载了全苏工会中央理事会主席团的声明。
    阿尔巴尼亚的“人民之声报”发表社论说：贝利亚叛国罪行的被清算，再一次证明了苏联共产党和苏联人民的伟大力量。在马克思列宁主义学说指导下的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，将更加紧密地团结自己的队伍。由于我国民主制度的巩固、人民的团结一致、革命警惕性的提高、和我们对苏联人民的热爱的加强，帝国主义反对阿尔巴尼亚的任何阴谋，也一定遭到失败。
    在德意志民主共和国，“新德意志报”、“青年世界报”、“论坛报”、“柏林日报”等都刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚罪行的决定。各报还转载了七月十日苏联“真理报”社论的全文。“新德意志报”还刊载了苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会联合全体会议斥责贝利亚反党反国家罪行的消息。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社平壤十四日讯：朝鲜“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚反党、反国家罪行的决定的消息。各报并以显著地位转载了苏联“真理报”七月十日的社论：“党、政府、苏联人民的不可摧毁的团结”。
    【新华社莫斯科十四日电】莫斯科各报在十四日继续报道苏联共产党各地党委员会和劳动人民举行全体会议和集会，讨论苏共中央全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚罪行的决定。各报并以整页篇幅，刊载了中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、德意志民主共和国以及美国、英国、法国、意大利、印度、瑞典、奥地利、丹麦和芬兰等国舆论对苏联共产党中央委员会及苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决定的评论。中华人民共和国的反应最长，放在第一条。塔斯社在它的北京十三日电说：“中国报纸非常注意贝利亚的罪恶的反党和反国家的活动的揭发，指出这个揭发是苏维埃国家的力量和威力的加强。”塔斯社报道了中国首都报纸的刊载情形和北京“人民日报”社论“苏联共产党的统一和巩固是全世界劳动人民的利益”的摘要。塔斯社十三日上海电中报道了上海报纸刊载的情形，说：“上海舆论和报纸评价贝利亚的罪行的揭露和苏联共产党中央委员会与苏联最高苏维埃主席团的坚决行动，是加强苏维埃国家力量和威力的因素。”塔斯社摘了上海“文汇报”和“新闻日报”的评论。
    “消息报”十四日并发表社论，号召共产党员和全体劳动人民提高革命警惕性说，事实证明，国际反动势力日益猖獗，他们派往民主阵营国家的特务也跟着猖獗起来了。卑鄙的堕落分子和叛徒、党和人民的敌人、国际帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的事件，就证明了这一点。在各方面、在各种情况下，都必须保持警惕性。我们必须记住，麻痹、自满和轻信，就会给帝国主义代理人的敌对和破坏活动创造条件。“消息报”又说，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决定，已得到了各国兄弟工人党、共产党及进步人士的一致拥护。兄弟共产党和工人党的报纸指出，必须从贝利亚事件吸取政治教训，并号召提高革命警惕性、扩大在群众中间的思想和政治工作，加强与群众的联系。这些报纸并号召无情地揭露和粉碎帝国主义雇佣分子的罪恶活动。
