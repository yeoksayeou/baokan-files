The United States has fixed the price of gold at $35 per ounce since the devaluation of the dollar in 1934, and it has not changed for twenty years. After World War II, especially after the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the purchasing power of the dollar continued to decline, and the dollar price of gold has actually changed. Therefore, major gold-producing countries such as those in the sterling area have demanded an increase in the price of gold. However, the United States, for its selfish purpose of harming others and benefiting itself, has resolutely opposed raising the official price of gold. This has created a sharp contradiction between the United States and Britain on the issue of gold prices.

Why does the United States want to suppress the official price of gold?

First, the United States purchases or obtains large amounts of gold at low prices as one of the tools to control the finances of the capitalist world. Although capitalist countries had successively abolished the gold standard and adopted a non-convertible paper currency system before World War II, gold is still the final means of payment in international payments. The United States is a creditor country, and as a result of frequent surpluses in international payments, its satellite countries must transport large amounts of gold to the United States every year. At the beginning of 1934, the United States owned gold worth 4 billion US dollars, accounting for 34 percent of the gold reserves of central banks in the capitalist world. By the end of 1952, U.S. gold reserves had increased to 23.2 billion US dollars, accounting for 64 percent of the capitalist world. From 1934 to 1952, the net gold inflow to the United States was approximately 20 billion US dollars. After the collapse of the gold standard in capitalist countries, the external value of gold has become even more important. The purpose of the United States in holding large amounts of gold is to seize and consolidate the dominant position of the dollar. Conversely, the reduction of gold reserves in other capitalist countries means that the status of their currencies is deteriorating. After the war, other capitalist countries generally experienced a dollar shortage with trade deficits with the United States of around 3 billion US dollars per year, and had to use limited gold to pay international debts. However, payment in gold must be accepted by the United States at the official price of $35 per ounce. If the official price is raised, it will increase the payment capacity of other capitalist countries. Therefore, the increased monetary value of gold held by other capitalist countries means that the United States' control over these countries is weakened.

Second, the damage caused by raising the price of gold to the United States is directly reflected in the devaluation of the dollar, because the dollar is a non-convertible paper currency, it is merely a symbol of gold. If the price of gold changes, the value of the dollar will also change. Raising the price of gold means raising the dollar price of gold, which results in the devaluation of the dollar. The instability of the dollar's value will cause the capitalist world to distrust the dollar and will convert dollar holdings into gold at any time, greatly reducing the monetary status of the United States. At the same time, raising the official price of gold means that the gold value of U.S. foreign claims will be reduced, and their interest income will also be reduced. This is extremely unfavorable to U.S. monopoly capitalists.

On the other hand, suppressing the price of gold causes great harm to gold-producing countries. The gold production of the sterling area accounted for 56 percent of the capitalist world in 1946-1952. This shows that the issue of gold prices is more important to the sterling area than to any other region. Sterling area countries produce large amounts of gold, but the price is very low, so they cannot increase their international payment capacity, nor can they significantly improve their increasingly serious international balance of payments deficits and gold reserve situation. At the same time, after the war, prices in the capitalist world rose sharply, and the cost of gold production increased, but the price of gold produced remained unchanged, resulting in a sharp decline in gold production. In 1952, the total value of gold production in the capitalist world decreased by 27 percent compared with 1940, and gold production in the sterling area decreased by 20 percent during the same period. Therefore, raising the official price of gold is becoming increasingly urgent for sterling area countries. As Lord Beryl, chairman of the Rhodes Bank of England said: "The current (capitalist) world gold reserves are about 36 billion U.S. dollars, only one-third more than before World War II, while the United States owns two-thirds, but (capitalist) world trade has increased three times compared with before the war. Therefore, the resulting gold shortage cannot be filled. There are two solutions: either redistribute the existing gold in the United States, but this is not easy to achieve; then raising the official price of gold is the only solution."

This is the reason why there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the United States and Britain on the issue of gold prices.

In the early stages of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, gold flowed out in large quantities. Due to the U.S. inflation policy, countries distrusted the dollar. In addition, the United States rushed to purchase strategic materials, and countries improved their international balance of payments, vying to withdraw deposits in the United States to purchase gold. Therefore, the struggle between the United States and Britain over the issue of gold prices became even more acute at that time. In September 1951, the United States had to admit that gold-producing countries could sell gold for industrial use on the free market at prices higher than the official price. The "International Monetary Fund Committee" announced: "The original hope that all member states would take uniform measures to prevent the premium sale of gold, now it seems that this goal is impossible to achieve." After this, Canada, Australia, Southern Rhodesia, and West Africa successively sold gold on the "free market" at prices higher than the official price. However, despite making some concessions, the United States has always opposed raising the official price of gold.

In August and September 1952, capitalist countries widely rumored that the dollar would be devalued and the price of gold might increase. In order to counter the U.S. coercion to implement the free convertibility of the pound sterling, Britain once again proposed raising the price of gold as a counterproposal to the conditions for implementing the free convertibility of the pound sterling after 1949. However, at the annual meeting of the "International Monetary Fund" held in September, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder said arbitrarily: "The United States has no reason to raise the gold price of thirty-five dollars an ounce at present. Our policy of maintaining the gold price unchanged is known to the world."

At the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference at the end of November, South African Finance Minister Havenga said: "Restoring the free convertibility of the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar without raising the price of gold will be extremely harmful to the gold and U.S. dollar reserves of the sterling area." Therefore, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference decided to request the United States to raise the price of gold as one of the conditions for implementing the free convertibility of the pound sterling.

In late February 1953, when British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler went to Washington to negotiate this issue with the United States, the United States showed a cold attitude. The South African Finance Minister said: "Britain did raise the issue of raising the price of gold to the United States." However, the communique of the meeting did not mention a word, which is enough to show that the United States and Britain did not reach any agreement on this issue.

In July 1952, U.S. gold flowed out again. The reason for this gold outflow seemed to be due to the possibility of a rise in gold prices, so Britain, the Netherlands and other countries rushed to buy gold, but basically it was due to the reduction of the U.S. trade surplus, and other capitalist countries increased their gold and U.S. dollar reserves. If the U.S. exports in 1952 excluded items related to military supplies, the third quarter decreased by 26 percent compared with the first quarter, and the surplus of goods and intangible income items decreased from 1.0052 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter to only 150 million U.S. dollars in the third quarter. Agricultural product exports in the second half of 1952 decreased by 30 percent compared with the same period in 1951.

When the U.S. trade surplus decreased sharply, and other capitalist countries increased their gold and U.S. dollar reserves as a result, and had the ability to compete for gold, other capitalist countries demanded even more to raise the price of gold and devalue the U.S. dollar. However, the United States will not raise the price of gold unless it is attacked by an economic storm and forced to implement a dollar devaluation.

The Citibank, which belongs to the Morgan Consortium, warned Britain in its "Monthly Newsletter" in January 1953 not to dream of raising the price of gold. The publication said: "Any method other than tightly grasping the current gold price and the dollar price should be excluded from our thinking." However, the "Gold and Silver Yearbook" of London's Sharm Muntega Company in 1952 said: "We believe that it is difficult to exclude this idea. The idea of ​​raising the price of gold is growing in most parts of the world, and this idea will continue to grow in the years to come."

From this, it seems that although the United States is currently desperately maintaining the low price of gold as one of the tools to enslave its satellite countries, Britain and other capitalist countries are always trying to break this shackle. At the same time, economic crisis factors are growing in the United States, and the actual value of the dollar has been reduced by 43 percent. Undoubtedly, the future struggle between the United States and Britain on the issue of gold prices will intensify with their struggle for markets, for raw materials, and for financial hegemony.

    美英在黄金价格问题上的斗争
    栗思提
    美国自一九三四年美元贬值以来，就把黄金价格钉定在每盎斯三十五美元的水平上，迄今二十年没有变动。第二次世界大战后，特别是美国发动侵朝战争后，美元购买力不断下降，以美元计算的黄金价格实际上已有变动，因此，主要产金国家如英镑区国家都提出了提高金价的要求。但美国为了损人利己的自私目的，却坚决反对提高黄金官价。这就造成了美英在黄金价格问题上的尖锐矛盾。
    美国为什么要压低黄金官价呢？
    首先，美国以低价购进或获得大量黄金作为控制资本主义世界金融的工具之一。资本主义国家虽然在第二次世界大战前都已经先后取消了金本位，采用不兑换纸币制，但在国际支付上黄金仍然是最后的支付手段。美国是一个债权国家，国际收支经常顺差的结果，仆从国家每年都要运送大量黄金给美国。一九三四年初美国拥有黄金价值四十亿美元，占资本主义世界各国中央银行存金百分之三十四。一九五二年底美国存金增加至二百三十二亿美元，占资本主义世界的百分之六十四。自一九三四——一九五二年美国黄金净输入约值二百亿美元。在资本主义国家金本位崩溃之后，黄金的对外价值具有更为重要的意义。美国持有大量黄金的目的就是为了夺取和巩固美元的统治地位。与此相反，其他资本主义国家黄金存量减少就意味着它们的货币地位愈趋恶化。战后其他资本主义国家每年对美国贸易逆差在三十亿美元左右，普遍感到美元荒，不得不以有限的黄金来支付国际债务。但以黄金支付必须按照每盎斯三十五美元的官价美国才能接受，如果提高官价就等于增强其他资本主义国家的支付能力。因此，其他资本主义国家持有的黄金货币价值增加，对于美国来说就是削弱了自己对这些国家的控制力量。
    其次，提高金价对于美国的损害直接表现在美元贬值上，因为美元是不兑换纸币，它不过是黄金的符号，黄金价格有了变化，美元的价值也就跟着要起变化。黄金价格提高是指黄金的美元价格提高，其结果就是美元价值贬低，美元价值不稳定，使得资本主义世界不信任美元，而会随时将美元头寸变成黄金，美国的货币地位就要大为降低。同时，提高黄金官价，就意味着美国的国外债权的黄金价值将要减低，他们的利息收入也要减少。这对美国垄断资本家来说是极为不利的。
    另一方面，压低黄金价格却给产金国家带来莫大的损害。英镑区的黄金产量在一九四六——一九五二年占资本主义世界的百分之五十六。这说明黄金价格问题，对于英镑区比对其他任何地区更为重要。英镑区国家生产大量黄金，但是价格很低，它们就不能提高国际上的支付能力，也就不能对于它的日益严重的国际收支逆差和黄金储备情况有重要的改善。同时战后资本主义世界物价剧烈上涨，黄金生产成本增加而生产出来的黄金价格未变，以致黄金生产大减。一九五二年资本主义世界黄金生产总值比一九四○年下降百分之二十七，同期英镑区黄金生产下降百分之二十。因此提高黄金官价，这对于英镑区国家是越来越迫切了。英国以罗德银行董事长伯莱说：“目前（资本主义）世界黄金存量约有三百六十亿美元，比较二次大战前只增加三分之一，而美国却拥有三分之二，但（资本主义）世界贸易则较战前增加了三倍，因此造成的黄金不足的缺口无法弥补，解决的办法有二：或者是重新分配美国现有的黄金，但这不易达到；那末只有提高黄金官价才是唯一的办法。”
    这就是美英两国在黄金价格问题上存在着不可调和的矛盾的原因所在。
    美国发动侵朝战争的初期，黄金大量外流。由于美国实行通货膨胀政策，各国对美元不信任；加以美国抢购战略物资，各国国际收支改善，争相提取在美存款抢购黄金。因此，那时美英在黄金价格问题上的斗争就更加尖锐化了。一九五一年九月，美国不得不承认产金国家得以高于官价的价格在自由市场上出售工业用黄金。“国际货币基金委员会”宣布：“原来希望所有会员国采取一律措施，防止溢价出售黄金，现在看来这个目的是不可能达到的”。在这以后加拿大、澳洲、南罗得西亚以及西非都相继在“自由市场”以高于官价的价格出售黄金。不过，美国尽管作了些让步，它还是始终反对提高黄金官价。
    一九五二年八、九月间，资本主义国家盛传美元贬值，金价有提高可能。英国为对抗美国强迫它实行英镑自由兑换，继一九四九年之后，再度提出提高金价作为实行英镑自由兑换的条件的对案。但在九月举行的“国际货币基金”年会上，美国前财长斯奈德蛮横地说：“美国没有任何理由在现在提高三十五元一盎斯的黄金价格。我们维持金价不变的政策是举世皆知的”。
    十一月底，在英联邦总理会议上，南非联邦财政部长哈文甲说：“恢复英镑与美元的自由兑换而不将金价提高，对于英镑区的黄金美元储备将有莫大的危害性”。于是，联邦总理会议决定向美国要求提高金价，作为实行英镑自由兑换的条件之一。
    一九五三年二月底，英外长艾登和财政大臣巴特勒到华盛顿和美国谈判这个问题时，美国态度冷淡。南非财长说：“英国确曾向美国提出提高金价问题”。但会谈公报上只字未提，足以说明美英在这个问题上没有取得任何协议。
        一九五二年七月，美国黄金再度外流。这次黄金外流的原因表面上似乎是由于黄金有涨价的可能，因而英国、荷兰等国争购黄金，但基本上是由于美国贸易顺差减少，其他资本主义国家黄金美元储备增加。美国一九五二年的出口如果去掉与军火有关项目，则第三季较第一季下降百分之二十六，商品及无形收支项目顺差由第一季十亿零五千二百万美元下降至第三季只有一亿五千万美元。农业品出口一九五二年下半年比一九五一年同期减少百分之三十。
    在美国贸易顺差剧减，其他资本主义国家因之增加了黄金美元准备，有了争购黄金的能力的时候，其他资本主义国家就更加要求提高金价，要求美元贬值。但是美国除了遭受经济风暴袭击而被迫实行美元贬值以外，是不肯提高金价的。
    属于摩根财团的花旗银行一九五三年一月在其“每月通讯”上警告英国不要作提高金价的迷梦。该刊说：“除了紧紧地掌握目前的黄金价格和美元价格以外的任何办法，都应该从我们的思想中排除出去”。但伦敦撤姆·蒙泰加公司一九五二年“金银年报”却说：“我们相信排除这种思想是困难的，提高金价的思想在世界大部地区都在增长着，在未来的年月中这种思想将继续增长着”。
    由此看来，美国目前虽然死命维持黄金低价作为奴役其仆从国家的工具之一，但是英国及其他资本主义国家随时都在想打破美国的这种桎梏。同时，经济危机因素正在美国增长着，美元的实际价值已降低百分之四十三。无疑地，美英今后在黄金价格问题上的斗争，将随着它们争夺市场，争夺原料，争夺金融霸权的斗争而日益加剧。
