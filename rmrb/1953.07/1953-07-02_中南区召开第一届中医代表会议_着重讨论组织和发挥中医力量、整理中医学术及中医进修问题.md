The Central South Administrative Committee Health Bureau convened the first Conference of Traditional Chinese Medicine Representatives of the Central South Region from June 10th to 14th. Present at the meeting were 108 representatives from the Traditional Chinese Medicine and traditional Chinese medicine pharmacy fields from six provinces and two municipalities in the region, eight Western medicine representatives, and sixteen responsible cadres from the health departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities. Also participating in the meeting were Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, and cadres from the health bureaus of major administrative regions across the country.

The meeting conveyed the spirit of the Second National Health Conference, reviewed the implementation of traditional Chinese medicine policies in the Central South Region over the past three years, and focused on discussing issues such as organizing and developing the strength of traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese medicine advanced studies, and sorting out traditional Chinese medicine academics, pointing out the direction of efforts for traditional Chinese medicine work in the region in the future.

Over the past three years, more than 10,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the Central South Region have participated in traditional Chinese medicine advanced study classes or advanced study schools, and more than 9,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have joined traditional Chinese medicine associations. They have all made some progress in terms of political awareness and health science knowledge. Many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have actively participated in vaccination, patriotic health campaigns, and health work for some basic construction projects. In addition, more than 3,000 traditional Chinese medicine joint clinics or integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine clinics have been organized throughout the region. However, the strength of traditional Chinese medicine has not been fully utilized in various regions, and the work of uniting and educating traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has not been done sufficiently. Chen Mingshu, Vice Chairman of the Central South Administrative Committee, Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, and Qi Zhonghuan, Director of the Central South Administrative Committee Health Bureau, all emphasized at the meeting: Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history and rich experience, and traditional Chinese medicine academics also have certain scientific content. Health administrative cadres at all levels should conscientiously strengthen the work of uniting traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, help traditional Chinese medicine practitioners study hard, and further improve their academic level. Pan Zinian, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central South Administrative Committee, said: "We must treat traditional Chinese medicine with the attitude of treating the precious heritage of the motherland, seriously treat traditional Chinese medicine, and help the sorting out and improvement of traditional Chinese medicine academics."

The representatives attending the meeting discussed and approved the three working drafts proposed by the Central South Administrative Committee Health Bureau on organizing and developing the strength of traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese medicine advanced studies, and sorting out traditional Chinese medicine academics. Qi Zhonghuan said in his report that organizing and developing the strength of traditional Chinese medicine is the focus of this year's traditional Chinese medicine work in the Central South Region. In this regard, the best way is to organize joint clinics. This year, we should consolidate the existing joint clinics and focus on organizing new joint clinics in areas where medical resources are particularly scarce. The principle of democracy and voluntarism should be implemented in organizing joint clinics. Health administrative departments and medical institutions may also absorb traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in the work, depending on the circumstances. Regarding the issue of traditional Chinese medicine advanced studies, the focus should be on consolidating and consolidating the existing advanced study classes and advanced study schools. The purpose of traditional Chinese medicine advanced studies is: to study politics, establish the concept of serving the people, correct work attitudes, and on this basis, strengthen the unity of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and the unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners. In addition, it is necessary to study basic medicine and preventive medicine, and in advanced study classes with better conditions, one can also study traditional Chinese medicine clinical medicine and traditional Chinese medicine pharmacy, in order to sort out traditional Chinese medicine academics and clinical experience, and organize the masses to carry out health campaigns. On the issue of sorting out traditional Chinese medicine academics, we should start with sorting out traditional Chinese medicine experience and affirming experience, and on this basis, conduct further research. The Central South Region will only conduct preparation and planning work this year.

The meeting fully promoted democracy. The representatives attending the meeting put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the traditional Chinese medicine work in the Central South Region. Traditional Chinese medicine representatives raised many opinions and difficulties on the status, treatment, and living problems of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and the issue of organizing joint clinics, especially reflecting the deviations in the implementation of traditional Chinese medicine policies at the lower levels. In his concluding report, Qi Zhonghuan criticized some cadres' wrong understanding of traditional Chinese medicine, and demanded that health cadres at all levels correctly implement traditional Chinese medicine policies. He called on traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to establish the concept of serving the people, strengthen the unity between traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and between traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, correct some prejudices and conservative ideas, and constantly absorb new things, so that they can continue to move forward. Qi Zhonghuan also asked the representatives to strengthen contact with the Central South Administrative Committee Health Bureau in the future, report situations at any time, and put forward criticisms and suggestions. Qi Zhonghuan announced at the meeting that the Traditional Chinese Medicine Committee of the Central South Administrative Committee Health Bureau was established on June 8th. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Committee has a total of sixteen members, and it is a consulting agency of the Central South Administrative Committee Health Bureau on traditional Chinese medicine work.

    中南区召开第一届中医代表会议
    着重讨论组织和发挥中医力量、整理中医学术及中医进修问题
    中南行政委员会卫生局在六月十日到十四日召开了中南区第一届中医代表会议。到会的有全区六省二市的中医、中药界代表一百零八人，西医代表八人及各省市人民政府卫生厅、局负责干部十六人。参加会议的还有中央人民政府卫生部副部长徐运北及全国各大行政区卫生局的干部。
    会议传达了第二届全国卫生会议的精神，检查了三年来中南区执行中医政策的情况，并着重讨论了关于组织发挥中医力量、中医进修及整理中医学术等问题，为今后全区中医工作指出了努力方向。
    三年来，中南区有一万多个中医参加了中医进修班或进修学校，并有九千多个中医参加了中医学会。他们在政治觉悟和卫生科学知识方面，都有一定程度的提高。在种痘、爱国卫生运动及一些基本建设工程的卫生工作中，都有不少中医积极参加。另外，全区还组织了三千多个中医联合诊所或中西医联合诊所。但各地还没有充分发挥中医的力量，对中医的团结、教育工作也作得不够。中南行政委员会副主席陈铭枢、中央人民政府卫生部副部长徐运北、中南行政委员会卫生局局长齐仲桓在会上都着重指出：中医有悠久的历史，丰富的经验，中医学术也有一定的科学内容。各地卫生行政干部应认真地加强团结中医工作，帮助中医努力学习，进一步提高学术水平。中南行政委员会文化教育委员会副主任潘梓年说：“我们要以对待祖国宝贵遗产的态度，严肃地对待中医医学，帮助中医学术的整理和提高。”
    到会代表讨论并同意了中南行政委员会卫生局提出的关于组织发挥中医力量、中医进修、中医学术整理问题的三个工作草案。齐仲桓在报告中说，组织发挥中医力量，是中南区今年中医工作的重点。在这个问题上，最好的方式是组织联合诊所。今年应巩固原有的联合诊所，在医疗力量特别缺乏的地区，重点地组织新的联合诊所。组织联合诊所，应贯彻民主自愿的原则。卫生行政部门和医疗机构，也可酌量情况吸收中医参加工作。关于中医进修问题，应以整顿巩固现有的进修班及进修学校为主。中医进修的目的是：学习政治，树立为人民服务的观点，端正工作态度，并在此基础上加强中医团结及中西医团结。另外是学习基础医学、预防医学，在条件较好的进修班中还可学习中医临床学、中药药学，以便整理中医学术及临床经验，组织群众开展卫生运动。在整理中医学术问题上，应从整理中医经验，肯定经验入手，在这个基础上，再作进一步研究，中南区今年只进行准备和计划工作。
    会议充分发扬了民主。到会各代表对中南区的中医工作提出了不少批评和建议。中医代表对中医的地位、待遇问题、生活问题和组织联合诊所问题提出了不少意见和困难，特别反映了下面在执行中医政策上的偏向。齐仲桓在总结报告中批判了某些干部对中医的错误认识，要求各级卫生干部正确贯彻中医政策。他号召中医要树立为人民服务的观点，加强中医之间和中西医之间的团结，纠正某些偏见和保守思想，不断地吸取新事物，使自己不断前进。齐仲桓也要求各代表今后与中南行政委员会卫生局加强联系，随时反映情况，提出批评和建议。齐仲桓在会上宣布了中南行政委员会卫生局中医委员会已在六月八日成立。中医委员会共有委员十六人，它是中南行政委员会卫生局关于中医工作的谘询机构。（新华社）
