Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th. According to TASS, party organizations in various parts of the Soviet Ukraine, together with party activists, held plenary sessions on the 11th to discuss the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's anti-party and anti-state crimes.

The joint plenary session of the Rovno Oblast Committee and the Rovno City Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, with party activists, was held in Rovno. Serdyuk, the secretary of the Rovno Oblast Committee of the Communist Party, made a report at the meeting. Subsequently, Academician Hytokalo of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences said in his speech: The Ukrainian people condemn the despicable provocateur, the vile double-dealer, and the turncoat bourgeois element Beria. This despicable running dog of foreign capital, the odious enemy of the Soviet people, attempted to incite disputes between the Ukrainian and Russian peoples and undermine the permanent friendship between our nationalities. But this scoundrel did not succeed. Liashuk, the party organization secretary of the Rovno Institute of Technology, spoke on behalf of the students and professors of the institute, saying that our anger and contempt for this degenerate of humanity are beyond description. He used deceptive means to climb to leadership positions and prepared to put shackles on us. He insidiously wanted to alienate our nationalities. But the working people of the western regions of Ukraine know that they owe their happiness and free and joyful life to the great Russian nation. Scoundrels like Beria can never destroy the sacred friendship between our fraternal nationalities. Flvarochny, the secretary of the Rovno Oblast Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that the members of the Communist Youth League and the youth in Rovno City and Rovno Oblast are infinitely loyal to the great Communist Party and are closely united around the Central Committee of the Party. Speakers at the meeting also pointed out some serious shortcomings in the work of the Party, Soviet, and economic organs, especially in ideological and cadre work. Finally, the joint plenary session unanimously adopted a resolution expressing full support for the decision of the plenary session of the Party Central Committee and implementing this resolution as an unwavering guide.

Party organizations in other parts of Ukraine also held gatherings with party activists. The plenary session of the Kursk Oblast Party Committee and the Kursk City Party Committee was held with high political enthusiasm. In a joint resolution, the Novgorod Oblast Party Committee and the Novgorod City Party Committee assured the Party Central Committee that the party organizations throughout the oblast will vigilantly defend the unity of the Party in the future. At the plenary sessions of the Orlov Oblast and City Party Committees, all speakers thanked the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee for the vigilance and determination it showed in exposing Beria, the enemy of the Party and the people. In addition, joint plenary sessions were also held by the party committees of Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, Uman, and Belozerka, etc. These meetings powerfully demonstrated the steel-like unity of the Party ranks. Those present at the meeting assured the Party Central Committee that they would contribute all their strength to the cause of the communist construction of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th. According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Estonian Republic held a plenary session on the 11th to discuss the summary of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the traitor Beria. Party activists of the republic also participated in the plenary session. Kebin, the secretary of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party, made a report at the meeting, and he and those who spoke in the discussion unanimously pointed out that the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great significance to the Party and all Soviet people. They warmly supported the timely and resolute measures taken by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to liquidate the crimes of Beria, the agent of international imperialism.

Ilissan, chairman of the Republic Trade Union Council, said in his speech that the working class and all working people of the republic should unite their ranks more closely around the Communist Party. They will spare no effort to fight for the victorious realization of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Kusk, a planer at the Tallinn Volt Motor Factory, said that all the staff of our factory unanimously support the measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union against Beria, the enemy of the people, and pledge to redouble our efforts to further strengthen the national strength of our Soviet socialist motherland and to fight for the construction of communism. I guarantee to complete at least two and a half production quotas myself.

Those who attended the plenary session listened very carefully to the speech of Tank, the chairman of the "Tamiku" collective farm in the Johviski District. He said that all our collective farm members unanimously support the decision made by the plenary session of our Party Central Committee on the Beria incident, the despicable enemy of the collective farm system. Only in the collective farm can we get a happy life, so we will continue to strengthen it in the future. When the members of the farm knew that I was going to attend the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party, they said to me: "Comrade Tank, please tell the Party that we all support it like one person, and we will not let anyone pull us back to capitalism and make us slaves of landlords and rich peasants."

Estonia, during the period of bourgeois rule, was a semi-colony of imperialist countries. But since breaking away from this rule and joining the brotherly family of the Soviet Union's nationalities, Estonia has become a prosperous industrial and collective farm socialist republic in the past thirteen years. Academician Heili, Secretary of the Estonian Republic Academy of Sciences, Lentsman, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party, and Grin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Estonian Republic, all spoke about this in their speeches. Grin said: Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union's nationalities, especially the Russian nationality, the working people of our republic have achieved economic and cultural prosperity. The despicable enemy Beria attempted to steal this precious achievement of our nationalities and destroy our friendship. But the enemy's despicable conspiracy went bankrupt. The strength of the Estonian people and the guarantee of their free and happy life lies in the friendship of the Soviet Union's nationalities.

Pusep, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Republic Supreme Soviet, Palm, Secretary of the Maryamaski District Party Committee, and Ilives, Secretary of the Haryuski District Party Committee, criticized the shortcomings of the Party, Soviet, trade union, youth league, and economic institutions of the republic. Those present particularly pointed out the shortcomings in ideological work.

The plenary session passed a resolution in an atmosphere of complete unity. The resolution said: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party, with the participation of a wide range of Party activists, assured the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of its infinite loyalty to the cause of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The party organization and working people of Soviet Estonia will sacredly consolidate their friendship with the great Russian nationality and other fraternal nationalities of our country, unite their ranks more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, and dedicate all their strength to the cause of constantly strengthening the growth of their socialist motherland and to the cause of building a communist society in our country.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th. According to TASS, the Almaty Oblast and Almaty City Committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Kazakh Republic, together with party activists from the city and oblast, held a joint plenary session on the 11th. More than 1,200 people attended the meeting. Shayakhmetov, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kazakh Communist Party, made a report on the summary of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the meeting. Those present supported the decision of the Party Central Committee plenary session on the traitor Beria with great satisfaction. All speakers expressed the unanimous opinion of the Almaty Oblast Party organization.

Babin, a worker at the Almaty Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Factory, said: All the workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of our factory unanimously and warmly support the decision of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee. The despicable activities of Beria, the running dog of international imperialism, have aroused the anger of all the working people of Kazakhstan.

Didekovsky, the chairman of the "Eastern Light" Collective Farm, condemned the crimes of Beria, the vicious enemy of the Party and the people, in his speech. He said that the crimes of this bourgeois degenerate aroused the indignation of all the members of the farm. The collective farmers believe that no one will ever be able to destroy our collective farm system.

All those who spoke at the plenary session very indignantly denounced Beria's rebellious behavior aimed at undermining the friendship of the Soviet nationalities and expressed their concern for further consolidating the friendship of the Soviet nationalities. Kosunov, the secretary of the Almaty Frunze District Party Committee, and Sauranbayev, the deputy director of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences, and others called for thoroughly eliminating the errors of bourgeois nationalism and constantly educating all working people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism and friendship between nationalities.

Yesmagambetov, the deputy director in charge of political work at the Iliya Machine Tractor Station, Omarov, the secretary of the Kazakh Writers Association, and Roslyakov, a doctor of biology, and others pointed out in their speeches that all the working people of Kazakhstan are united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They said that under the long-tested leadership of the Party and the Party Central Committee, the working people of Kazakhstan will devote all their strength to the cause of building communism.

Those present exposed and severely criticized the shortcomings in the work of the Party and Soviet organizations. They pointed out that some district committees do not consistently adhere to the principle of collectivism when solving problems. The plenary sessions of the district committees often fail to ensure the widespread development of criticism and self-criticism. Some Party organizations do not convene Party member meetings regularly. The meeting paid great attention to the tasks of the Party organization in improving ideological work.

The joint plenary session finally unanimously supported the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and expressed its intention to implement it as an unwavering guide. The plenary session assured the CPSU Central Committee that the Almaty Party organization will continue to be a faithful and reliable pillar of the Party Central Committee, and that the Kazakh communists will unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and, under its firm and long-tested leadership, guide the working people to struggle for the implementation of the policies formulated by the Party.

    苏联共产党队伍的钢铁般团结
    乌克兰、爱沙尼亚、哈萨克等地党组织拥护苏共中央决定
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联乌克兰各地党组织会同党活动分子，在十一日举行全体会议，讨论苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于贝利亚反党、反国家罪行的决定。
    乌克兰加盟共和国共产党罗夫州委员会和罗夫市委员会，与党活动分子联合举行的全体会议，在罗夫市举行。共产党罗夫州委员会书记谢尔久克在会上做了报告。接着，乌克兰科学院院士希托卡洛在发言中说：乌克兰人民痛斥卑鄙的挑拨者、下流的两面分子、变节的资产阶级分子贝利亚。这个外国资本的卑鄙的走狗，苏联人民可恶的敌人，企图煽动乌克兰人民和俄罗斯人民之间的纠纷，破坏我国各民族之间的永久的友谊。但是，这个败类并没有成功。罗夫工艺学院的党组织书记利亚舒克代表工艺学院的学生和教授讲话，他说，我们对人类的败类的愤怒和鄙弃，是无法形容的，他用欺骗的手段爬上了领导地位，并准备给我们套上枷锁。他阴险地想离间我国各民族。但乌克兰西部各州的劳动人民知道，他们所以获得幸福和自由愉快的生活，要归功于伟大的俄罗斯民族。贝利亚之流的败类是永远不能破坏我国各兄弟民族之间的神圣的友谊的。共产主义青年团罗夫州委员会书记弗尔瓦罗契奈说，罗夫市和罗夫州的青年团团员和青年们，无限忠诚于伟大的共产党，紧密团结在党的中央委员会周围。在会上发言的人还指出了党、苏维埃和经济机关的一些严重缺点，特别是思想工作和干部工作的缺点。联合全体会议最后在一致通过的决议中表示完全拥护党中央委员会全体会议的决定，并把这个决议作为坚定不移的指针加以执行。
    乌克兰其他各地的党组织也和党的活动分子举行了集会。库尔斯克州党委员会和库尔斯克市党委员会的全体会议，是在高涨的政治积极性中举行的。诺夫哥罗德州党委员会和诺夫哥罗德市党委员会，在联合决议中向党中央保证，全州的党组织今后将警觉地保卫党的团结。在奥尔洛夫州和市的党委员会全体会议上，所有的发言人都感谢苏共中央主席团在揭穿党和人民的敌人贝利亚上所表现的警惕性和坚定性。此外，在哈尔科夫、萨坡罗什、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、乌曼和别罗泽尔科等州和市的党委员会，也举行了联合全体会议。这些会议有力地显示了党队伍的钢铁般的团结。到会的人都向党中央委员会保证，要把自己的一切力量贡献给祖国的共产主义建设事业。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联爱沙尼亚加盟共和国共产党中央委员会，在十一日举行全体会议，讨论了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于叛徒贝利亚的总结。共和国的党活动分子也参加了全体会议。爱沙尼亚共产党中央委员会书记凯宾在会上作了报告，他和在讨论中发言的人一致指出，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决定，对党和全体苏联人民都具有重大的意义。他们热烈地拥护苏联共产党中央委员会主席团为清算国际帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的罪行而采取的及时而坚决的措施。
    共和国工会理事会主席伊利桑在发言时说，共和国的工人阶级和全体劳动人民，要把自己队伍更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围。他们要不遗余力地为胜利实现第五个五年计划而奋斗。塔林伏特电机工厂的刨工库斯克说，我们全厂工作人员都一致拥护苏联共产党中央委员会对人民的敌人贝利亚所采取的措施，并保证要加倍努力，为进一步加强自己的苏维埃社会主义祖国的国力、为建设共产主义而奋斗。我保证自己至少完成两个半的生产定额。
    参加全体会议的人都很注意地倾听了约赫维斯克区“塔米库”集体农庄主席汤克的发言。他说，我们全体集体农庄庄员，完全一致地拥护我们党中央委员会全体会议对集体农庄制度的卑鄙敌人贝利亚的事件所作出的决定。只有在集体农庄中我们才能得到幸福的生活，所以我们今后仍然要加强它。当庄员们知道我要出席爱沙尼亚共产党中央委员会全体会议时，他们对我说：“汤克同志，请你转告给党，就说我们大家好像一个人一样地在支持它，我们不让任何人把我们拉回到资本主义，使我们受地主和富农的奴役。”
    爱沙尼亚在资产阶级统治时期，曾是帝国主义国家的半殖民地。但自从脱离了这种统治加入苏联各民族的兄弟大家庭以后，爱沙尼亚十三年来，已经变成一个繁荣的工业化和集体农庄的社会主义共和国。爱沙尼亚共和国科学院秘书海伊利院士、爱沙尼亚共产党中央委员会书记伦次曼、爱沙尼亚共和国部长会议副主席格林等人，在他们的发言中都谈到了这一点。格林说：由于苏联各兄弟民族的帮助、首先是由于俄罗斯民族的帮助，我们共和国的劳动人民获得了经济上和文化上的繁荣。卑鄙的敌人贝利亚企图盗窃我们各民族的这一宝贵的成果，破坏我们的友谊。但敌人的卑鄙阴谋破产了。爱沙尼亚人民的力量以及他们的自由和幸福生活的保障，就在于苏联各民族的友谊。
    共和国最高苏维埃主席团副主席普塞普、马尔雅马斯克区党委会书记帕尔姆、哈尔尤斯克区党委会书记伊利维斯等，对共和国的党、苏维埃、工会、青年团和经济机构的缺点都提出了批评。到会者特别指出了思想工作中的缺点。
    全体会议在完全团结一致的气氛中，通过了一项决议。决议说：爱沙尼亚共产党中央委员会吸收广泛的党的活动分子参加的全体会议，向苏联共产党中央委员会保证自己对苏联共产党的事业的无限忠诚。苏维埃爱沙尼亚的党组织和劳动人民，将神圣地巩固自己与伟大俄罗斯民族以及我国其他各兄弟民族的友谊，要更紧密地把自己的队伍团结在苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围，把自己的全部力量献给不断加强自己社会主义祖国的壮大的事业，献给我国建设共产主义社会的事业。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：哈萨克加盟共和国共产党阿拉木图州和阿拉木图市委员会，联合市和州的党活动分子，在十一日举行了联合全体会议。参加会议的有一千二百余人。哈萨克共产党中央委员会书记夏亚赫麦托夫，在会上做了关于苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的总结的报告。到会者十分满意地拥护党中央委员会全体会议关于叛徒贝利亚的决定。所有发言的人都表示出阿拉木图州党组织的一致的意见。
    阿拉木图重型机器制造厂的工人巴宾说：我们全厂的工人、工程师、技术人员和职员，一致热烈地拥护苏共中央委员会全体会议的决定。国际帝国主义的走狗贝利亚的卑鄙的活动，引起了全体哈萨克劳动人民的愤怒。
    “东方之光”集体农庄主席迪德科夫斯基，在发言中谴责党和人民的凶恶敌人贝利亚的罪行。他说，这个资产阶级蜕化分子的罪行，激起全体庄员的愤慨。集体农民认为，任何人不论在什么时候也破坏不了我国的集体农庄制度。
    所有在全体会议上发言的人都非常愤慨地痛斥贝利亚旨在破坏苏联各族人民友谊的叛逆行为，并表示对于进一步巩固苏联各民族的友谊的关心。阿拉木图伏龙芝区党委会书记科苏诺夫、哈萨克科学院副院长萨乌兰巴耶夫等人，号召彻底肃清资产阶级民族主义的错误，不断地用无产阶级国际主义和民族间友好的精神来教育全体劳动人民。
    伊里雅机器拖拉机站负责政治工作的副站长叶斯马甘别托夫、哈萨克作家协会书记奥马罗夫、生物学博士罗斯里雅科夫等在发言时，指出了哈萨克全体劳动人民一致团结在苏联共产党的周围。他们说，哈萨克的劳动人民在党和党的中央委员会的久经考验的领导下，将把全部力量用于建设共产主义的事业。
    到会者揭露并严厉地批评了党和苏维埃组织的工作中的缺点。他们指出，有的区党委在解决问题时不是一贯地遵守集体原则的。在区委会的全体会议上常常不能保证广泛地展开批评和自我批评。有些党的组织不常召开党员大会。会议非常注意党组织在改进思想工作方面的任务。
    联合全体会议最后一致拥护苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决定，并表示要将它作为坚定不移的指针加以执行。全体会议向苏共中央委员会保证：阿拉木图的党组织今后仍将是党中央委员会忠实可靠的支柱，哈萨克的共产党员要更紧密地团结在党中央委员会的周围，在它的坚定和久经考验的领导下，引导劳动人民为实现党所制订的政策而奋斗。
