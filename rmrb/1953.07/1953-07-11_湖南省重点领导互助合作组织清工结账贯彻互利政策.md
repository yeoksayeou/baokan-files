    Hunan Province is focusing on leading mutual aid and cooperative organizations to implement mutually beneficial policies, starting with clearing work and settling accounts. Hunan Province's mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed rapidly in the past three years, with farmers participating in mutual aid teams (mainly temporary mutual aid teams) accounting for more than 30% of the total number of farming households in the province. However, because some mutual aid teams infringed on farmers' ownership rights and prematurely and hastily expanded public property, such as the free public use of farm tools and draft cattle, it affected farmers' enthusiasm for production. After studying the CCP Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and the instructions to Party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing production, rural cadres in various localities began to rectify mutual aid teams with a focus. During the rectification, they mostly started by summarizing production achievements, mobilizing team members to compare and recall the benefits of organizing, and then clearing work and settling accounts. Farmers are very satisfied with this approach. Wang Benli's mutual aid team in Xiadong Township, Linwu County, did not clear work and settle accounts from April last year to April this year, and the mutual aid team virtually disbanded. The working cadres then helped this team to clear work and settle accounts. Team member Wang Kaigui should have paid 50 jin of wage grain and paid it on the spot; some, after both parties volunteered, wrote promissory notes and paid them off with interest in the autumn harvest. A system of clearing work and settling accounts every ten days was also established. Wang Bangding, a middle peasant who had previously requested to withdraw from the team, no longer withdrew; the team's more than 30 mu of rice fields were universally top-dressed with fertilizer, and the seedlings grew particularly well. In the process of clearing work and settling accounts, mutual aid teams in various localities re-evaluated and recorded work points for the past centralized use of farm tools and draft cattle that had not been evaluated and recorded, and settled them clearly. Some mutual aid teams have also further resolved the issue of equal pay for equal work for men and women. As the problems of these mutual aid teams have been better resolved, under their influence, many temporary mutual aid teams and perennial mutual aid teams have been further developed and consolidated.

    湖南省重点领导互助合作组织清工结账贯彻互利政策
    湖南省互助合作组织正有重点地从清工结账着手，贯彻互利政策。湖南省三年来互助合作运动发展很快，参加互助组（主要是临时互助组）的农民占全省总农户百分之三十以上。但因为有些互助组发生了侵犯农民所有权和过早过急地扩大公共财产，把农具、耕牛无代价地公共使用等，影响了农民生产的积极性。各地农村干部经过学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示等文件后，开始有重点地整顿互助组。整顿时，多从总结生产成绩入手，发动组员对比回忆组织起来的好处，然后进行清工结账。农民对这种做法很满意。临武县下洞乡王本理互助组从去年四月到今年四月没有清工结账，互助组无形散伙。工作干部就帮助这个组进行清工结账，组员王开桂应出五十斤工资谷，当场就出了；有的经过双方自愿，写好借条，秋收时加息还清。并订出十天清工结账的制度。以前要求退组的中农王邦定也不退组了；全组三十多亩稻田普遍追施了肥料，禾苗长得特别好。各地互助组在清工结账中，对于过去集中使用农具、耕牛没有评分记工的，重新作了补评记工，结算清楚。有些互助组还进一步解决了男女同工同酬问题。由于这部分互助组的问题得到较好的解决，在它们的影响下，许多临时互助组和常年互助组都获得进一步的发展和巩固。
