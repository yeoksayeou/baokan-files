    Nanjing Film Projector Factory Mass-Producing Small Film Projectors

    The Nanjing Film Projector Factory, under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, was gradually expanded and developed from a repair section of a film studio. Initially, it could only repair film machinery and only imitate a small number of film projector accessories or parts. Later, after experimentation and overcoming many difficulties in the work, it has now begun to mass-produce sixteen-millimeter small sound film projectors to meet the needs of the country's growing mobile film projection teams. From June to December of last year, the factory produced 149 film projectors. In the first half of this year, it has already produced 271 units, and in the second half of this year, it will produce another 479 units.

    南京电影机制造厂大量制造小型电影放映机
    中央人民政府文化部电影局所属南京电影机制造厂，是由原来一个电影制片厂修理科的一个部分逐步扩充发展而成的，最初只能修理电影机械，只能仿制少量的电影放映机的附属机件或零件。后来经过试验摸索和克服了工作中许多困难，现在已开始大量制造十六毫米的小型有声电影放映机，以供应全国日益发展的电影流动放映队的需要。该厂去年六月到十二月，生产了电影放映机一百四十九台，今年上半年已经生产了二百七十一台，今年下半年还要生产四百七十九台。
