Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th: "Pravda" published an observer's commentary on July 6th entitled "On International Adventurist Actions and Defending Peace." The commentary analyzed the purpose of the provocative propaganda in the American bourgeois press and the slanderous and instigating remarks by congressmen and government officials after the failure of the foreign mercenary's adventurist actions in Berlin. The commentary pointed out that this is primarily because the American ruling circles are clearly uneasy about the bankruptcy of their notorious policy of strength in foreign policy. The clear fact that all attempts by American diplomats to isolate the Soviet Union have completely failed is of even greater significance. Serious differences exist between the United States and its major European partners on the most important international issues. American diplomats, on the one hand, are threatening their allies with the cessation of "aid" and economic and political pressure and the frenzied propaganda of the "Soviet threat;" on the other hand, they are taking adventurous actions like those in Berlin to show that Dulles' so-called "tough policy" is beginning to bear fruit.

The commentary said: It is difficult to say whether the adventurers are more arrogant or more stupid. One thing is clear: the people who created the adventurous plan completely underestimated the realistic balance of power on the international stage. They did not see that the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy is receiving increasingly widespread support around the world; at the same time, the adventurous policy of the American aggressive bloc is being universally condemned, and even its Western European partners do not support it. Experience has proven that such instigators who treat truly independent and freedom-loving countries with a policy of domination will gain nothing but failure. The American ruling circles ignore this. They stubbornly stick to their ways, organizing the Berlin adventure in the heart of Europe one moment, and the Syngman Rhee provocation in Korea the next, and are probably preparing new adventures and provocations.

The commentary said: The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and the People's Democracies are the truly strong pillars of world peace. This shocks the imperialist camp, especially the aggressive bloc, which is preparing to organize new adventures and provocations, and inciting newspapers to carry out new propaganda around this point, attempting to hinder the relaxation of international tensions. However, this not only does not mean the consolidation of their positions, but on the contrary proves that this makes the aforementioned aggressive bloc increasingly isolated internationally. As for all the organizers of this propaganda that clearly shows contempt for the people's will for peace, they will fall into an even more difficult and inescapable predicament with their policies.

    “真理报”发表观察家评论“关于国际冒险行动和保卫和平”
    美国冒险家的行动使自己越来越孤立
    【新华社莫斯科六日电】“真理报”六日发表观察家“关于国际冒险行动和保卫和平”的评论。评论分析了外国雇佣分子在柏林冒险行动失败之后，美国资产阶级报刊的挑衅宣传及众议员和政府人员的诬蔑和教唆言论的目的。评论指出：这首先是因为美国统治集团对自己的对外政策臭名昭彰的强力政策的破产明显地不安。美国外交家所有孤立苏联的企图完全破产的清楚事实，具有更重大意义。美国和它的欧洲主要伙伴之间，在最重要的国际问题上存在着严重分歧。美国外交家一方面以停止“援助”与经济的政治的压力和“苏维埃的威胁”的疯狂宣传来恐吓它的同盟国；另一方面采取像在柏林那样的冒险行动，来表示杜勒斯的所谓“强硬政策”开始有结果。
    评论说：很难说冒险家蛮横多些还是愚蠢多些。有一件事是明显的：制造冒险计划的人完全不估计国际舞台上现实的力量对比。他们没有看到苏联爱好和平政策受到全世界日益广泛的支持；同时，美国侵略集团的冒险政策受到普遍的谴责，甚至它的西欧伙伴也不支持。经验证明，用支配政策对待真正独立的爱好自由的国家，这种怂恿者除了失败以外不会得到别的。美国统治集团是无视这个的。它固执自己的作法，一忽在欧洲中心组织了柏林冒险行动，一忽在朝鲜组织了李承晚挑衅行动，并且大概在准备新的冒险和挑衅。
    评论说：苏联和中华人民共和国及人民民主国家是世界和平的真正强大支柱。这使帝国主义阵营特别是侵略集团震惊，它们准备组织新的冒险和挑衅，并且煽起报纸围绕这点进行新的宣传，企图阻碍国际紧张形势的缓和。然而，这不仅不意味它们阵地的巩固，而相反地证明，这使得上述侵略集团在国际上越来越孤立。至于所有这些对人民和平的意志表现明显的轻蔑的宣传的组织者，他们将和自己的政策陷入更困难脱身的绝境。
