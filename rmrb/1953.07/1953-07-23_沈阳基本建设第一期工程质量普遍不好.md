    Poor Quality of First Phase of Basic Construction Projects in Shenyang

    [This newspaper reported] (this newspaper is 本报讯） As Shenyang's basic construction projects enter the most intense construction season, the first phase of projects is about to be completed successively. However, judging from the construction situation of most construction sites, the phenomenon of poor project quality is still relatively common, and accidents continue to occur.

    According to incomplete statistics, the three construction companies under the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have experienced 226 quality accidents from the start of construction to the present. The situation at various construction sites of the Third Construction Company is the most serious. The 316 construction site of this company had 38 quality accidents in just over a month after construction started. In May and June, this construction site failed to complete the schedule due to accidents. The foundation project is the most important part of the entire civil engineering construction, but the quality of the foundation project at the 310 and other four construction sites of this company is very poor. For example, the 311 construction site used the center line as the edge line, and the foundation was offset by 75 centimeters; the western foundation angle of the 313 construction site was incorrect, and the outer wall and the seven partition walls were inclined by 44 centimeters; the foundation of the front door lintel of the 312 construction site was inclined by 43 centimeters; the foundation of the basement of the 310 construction site was made narrower, so the original plan to build a one-brick-thick waterproof protective layer had to be changed to a half-brick-thick one. Other phenomena such as uneven wall surfaces, non-right-angled wall corners, incomplete grouting, pitting, and exposed reinforcing bars are even more common. The quality of some construction sites under the Shenyang Construction Engineering Company of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building Industry is also quite poor. In a certain project contracted by the company for the Second Machine Tool Plant, there were no operating procedures or inspection systems, and the construction personnel did not carefully compare the drawings during construction. After completing more than 30 meters of foundation, they could not match the joints when laying bricks. It turned out that one end of the foundation was offset by 30 centimeters.

    The main reasons for the poor project quality are that the leading cadres of the construction units lack correct ideological and technical leadership, and rarely conduct quality education for employees. In addition, the technical personnel and workers have no idea about the project progress, and sometimes they ignore quality when rushing progress. Many construction sites are very weak in technical management, and various technical responsibility systems have not been established and implemented seriously, so problems cannot be discovered and solved in time, but are discovered when the partial and sub-item projects are about to end, causing great losses.

    In order to change the above situation, the Industry Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all units to conduct a quality inspection with leadership and emphasis, requiring all units to strengthen the education of employees on "quality first," and to earnestly clarify the main problems in the project quality of their units, and then guide all employees to discuss around the center with a clear understanding. Units that have not yet formulated quality standards, technical operating procedures, and technical responsibility systems should formulate them as soon as possible, and at the same time, establish and improve the regular independent inspection agencies.

### 沈阳基本建设第一期工程质量普遍不好

    沈阳基本建设第一期工程质量普遍不好
    【本报讯】沈阳市基本建设工程进入最紧张的施工季度，第一期工程快要相继完工。但是从大部分工地施工情况来看，工程质量不好的现象还比较普遍，事故也不断发生。
    据不完全的统计，沈阳市建筑工程局所属的三个工程公司，从开工到现在，发生了质量事故二百二十六件。第三工程公司各工地的情况最严重。这个公司的三一六工地开工一个多月，质量事故就达三十八件。五、六月份这个工地因为事故没有完成进度计划。基础工程是整个土木建筑工程中最重要的部分，但这个公司的三一○等四个工地，基础工程的质量都很不好。如三一一工地拿中线当作边线，把基础打偏了七十五公分；三一三工地西部基础角度不对，外墙和七道间壁斜了四十四公分；三一二工地的正门门斗基础打斜了四十三公分；三一○工地因地下室的基础作窄了，只得将原计划砌一砖厚的防水保护层改砌半砖厚。其他像墙面不平、墙角不直、灌浆不饱满、麻面、露筋等现象更是到处可见。中央第一机械工业部沈阳建筑工程公司所属的一些工地质量也相当低劣。该公司承包的机械二厂某项工程，既无操作规程又无检查制度，施工中施工人员也不认真对照图纸，打完了三十多公尺长的基础，砌砖时却对不上槎，原来地基的一头打偏了三十公分。
    工程质量不好的主要原因是施工单位的领导干部缺乏正确的思想领导和技术领导，平时很少向职工进行质量教育，加以技术人员和工人对于工程进度心中无数，有时一赶进度就忽略了质量。许多工地在技术管理上非常薄弱，没有认真建立与贯彻各种技术责任制，因此不能及时发现问题，解决问题，而是等到分部分项工程要结束时才发现有问题，造成了很大的损失。
    为了改变以上情况，中共沈阳市委工业部指示各单位要有领导有重点地进行一次质量检查，要求各单位加强对职工进行“质量第一”的教育，并切实弄清本单位工程质量上的主要问题，然后心中有数地引导全体职工围绕中心来讨论。凡是尚未制订质量标准、技术操作规程、技术责任制的单位，应从速制订，同时要把经常性的独立检查机构建立和健全起来。
