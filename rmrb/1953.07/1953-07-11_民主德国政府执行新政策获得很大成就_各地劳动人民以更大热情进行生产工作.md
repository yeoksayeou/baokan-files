Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 10th: According to "Pravda's" Berlin correspondent Naumov, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are rallying more closely around their government to respond to the adventures of fascist hired agents. They are achieving more in production and working harmoniously and in an organized manner.

Naumov pointed out that the working people are practically feeling the results of the new policies followed by the government of the German Democratic Republic. Trade has become more active, and the work of supplying the people with food has improved. Local government institutions have largely completed the work of formulating plans on how to implement government decisions. In the major cities of the republic, new plans have been adopted for housing and public utilities construction, as well as increasing the production of consumer goods. Various industrial sectors of the republic are drafting plans to further improve working conditions and better supply employees with work clothes, manufactured goods, and food. Workers are actively participating in the formulation of these plans.

Naumov continued, saying that the working people of the republic are more clearly feeling that the people's government is not just making empty talk. They are responding to the Party's concern for the people's welfare with greater labor enthusiasm.

The miners of the republic have recently achieved great success. Many coal mines have completed their semi-annual plans ahead of schedule. On June 17th, the day the fascists carried out provocations, not a single miner left their post at the Zwickau-Oelsnitz coal mine. On that day, some coal mines and briquette factories exceeded their production plans.

The slogan of the farmers of the German Democratic Republic during the grain harvest is: "The first batch of new harvest is paid to the state." In some areas, the first batch of new grain has already been paid to the grain collection agencies. To show their loyalty to the government, farmers in some agricultural areas voluntarily over-fulfilled their plans and paid a large amount of products to the state.

Working people in villages and towns across the republic have held rallies, which have become grand meetings where the working people express their loyalty to the government and their determination to contribute all their energy to building a happy, free, and unified Germany.

    民主德国政府执行新政策获得很大成就
    各地劳动人民以更大热情进行生产工作
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：“真理报”驻柏林记者瑙莫夫说，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民正更紧密地团结在他们的政府的周围，来答复法西斯雇用特务的冒险行动。他们在生产上正得到更多的成就，正和谐地有组织地进行工作。
    瑙莫夫指出劳动人民实际地感觉到了德意志民主共和国政府所遵循的新政策的结果。贸易活跃起来了，供应人民粮食的工作改善了。地方政府机构大体已经完成拟订如何执行政府决定的计划的工作。在共和国的大城市里，已经通过了房屋与公用事业建筑以及提高消费品产量的新计划。共和国各工业部门正在拟定计划，来进一步改善劳动条件，更好地供应职工以工作服、制成品和粮食。工人们积极参加这些计划的拟定工作。
    瑙莫夫继续说，共和国的劳动人民更清楚地感觉到人民政府不是专事空谈的。他们以更大的劳动热情来答复党对于人民福利的关怀。
    共和国的矿工最近获得了巨大的成就。许多煤矿提前完成了半年计划。在六月十七日，就是法西斯进行挑衅的那一天，兹维考奥尔斯涅兹煤矿没有一个矿工离开工作岗位。在一些煤矿和煤球工厂里，那一天都超额完成了生产计划。
    德意志民主共和国的农民在收割谷物时候的口号是：“第一批新收成缴纳给国家。”在有些地区，第一批新谷物已经缴纳给了收粮机构。为表示对政府的忠诚，有一些农业地区的农民自愿超计划地缴纳给国家大量产品。
    共和国各地村镇的劳动人民纷纷举行集会，这些集会成了劳动人民表示对政府的忠诚，表示他们决心贡献全部精力来建设一个幸福、自由、统一的德国的大会。
