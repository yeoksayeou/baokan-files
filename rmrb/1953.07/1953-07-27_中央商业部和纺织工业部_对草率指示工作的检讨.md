Central Ministry of Commerce and Central Ministry of Textile Industry Letter: Comrade Ding Jianlu’s opinion is basically correct. When handling the issue of excess moisture in raw cotton transported to Qingdao, we indeed exhibited a bureaucratic work style of issuing instructions hastily without understanding the situation.

Regarding the Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company's acceptance of cotton with moisture content exceeding the legal limit from cooperatives and its transportation to Qingdao, we initially paid great attention to it. The Central Textile Industry Department, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company sent cadres to the cotton-producing areas of Shandong to investigate the causes and try to stop it at the root. Regarding the existing large quantity of cotton with excessive moisture, we instructed factories to use it as much as possible from the perspective of the overall national interest, to avoid it being shelved and deteriorating, which was correct. However, we vaguely stipulated that the losses caused by using this cotton would be the responsibility of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. In terms of the scope of use, we accommodated the established facts and objective difficulties, only hoping that the factories would finish processing it, without considering that this would increase production difficulties for the factories and affect the quality of the finished products. At the same time, our understanding of the actual situation was very poor at that time. We did not recognize the seriousness of the problem, nor did we know that the local Financial and Economic Committee already had a solution. We hastily issued a decision with different standards, which caused difficulties for lower-level organizations and delayed the solution to the problem. We also failed to inspect the handling situation afterward. These bureaucratic work styles brought great losses to the work.

We are now prepared to take the following two steps to prevent similar incidents from happening:

	One, according to the investigation, the main reasons for the increased moisture content of cotton in Shandong are: One is that some cotton farmers pluck cotton stalks and strip cotton bolls when the cotton has not yet matured and opened. This not only increases the moisture content in seed cotton but also seriously affects the strength of the cotton fiber, affecting the use-value of the cotton. Most of the raw cotton with excessive moisture transported to Qingdao was plucked stalk and stripped boll cotton. The other is that the cotton purchasing agencies in Shandong Province did not strictly implement the scale-up system for cotton with low moisture content; there was no benefit for cotton farmers to sell dry cotton, so they sold it without drying. In addition, the storage conditions of cotton warehouses were not good, and a lot of cotton was stored in the open air. We will contact relevant departments to educate farmers to change the habit of plucking stalks and stripping bolls, and to advocate selling cotton after it has been dried; purchasing departments should strictly implement the method of scaling up or deducting scales according to the amount of moisture in the cotton in the future.

	Two, correct the shortcomings in the raw cotton supply work. At present, there are indeed many shortcomings in the work of trade departments in supplying raw materials in a planned way according to industrial needs. Although this is due to some practical difficulties in the work (mainly that agricultural products cannot be fully adapted to the planned specifications of textile industry raw materials), we should make every effort to improve in the future. The textile department should also strengthen contact with the trade department, deepen its understanding of the actual situation of cotton supply, and try its best to overcome difficulties in the production process.

### 中央商业部和纺织工业部  对草率指示工作的检讨

    中央商业部和纺织工业部
    对草率指示工作的检讨
    中央商业部、中央纺织工业部来信：丁建洛同志的意见基本上是正确的。我们在处理运到青岛的超水分原棉问题时，的确有着不了解情况而草率指示工作的官僚主义作风。
    对于山东省花纱布公司接收合作社含水量超过法定限度的棉花运送青岛的问题，我们开始时也很重视，曾由中央纺织部、全国合作总社、中国花纱布公司派出干部共同去山东棉产区检查发生原因，设法从根本上加以制止。对于已有的大量含水的棉花，我们从国家整体利益出发，指示工厂尽量使用，以免搁置变质，这是正确的。但是，我们对使用这些棉花所造成的损失只含混规定由花纱布公司负责；在使用范围上也迁就既成事实与客观困难，只希望工厂处理完毕，而没有考虑到这会使工厂增加生产困难与影响成品质量。同时我们当时对实际情况了解很差，没有认识问题的严重性，也不知道当地财委已经有了解决办法，就草率下达一个尺度不同的决定，使下级机构工作发生困难，使问题拖延不能解决，而我们事后也没有去检查处理情形。这些官僚主义作风，给工作带来了很大的损失。
    我们现在准备采取以下两个步骤来防止发生同类事件：
        一、据调查，山东棉花水分增加的主要原因：一个是有些棉农在棉花没有成熟吐絮时，就拔棉秆剥棉桃。这不但使籽棉中含水量增加，而且严重影响了棉纤维的强力，影响了棉花的使用价值。运到青岛的含水过多的原棉大部分是拔秆剥桃棉。另一个是山东省的棉花收购机构对含水量少的棉花没有严格执行升秤制度；棉农出售干燥棉花没有好处，因此不晒花就出售。再加上储棉仓库条件不好，很多棉花露天堆存。我们将和有关部门联系，教育农民改变拔秆剥桃的习惯，提倡棉花晒后再卖；收购部门今后应严格执行按棉花含水量多寡而升秤或扣秤的办法。
    二、改正原棉供应工作中的缺点。目前贸易部门在有计划地按照工业需要供应原料的工作中，的确有不少缺点，这虽然是因为工作中有些实际困难（主要是农业产品不能完全和纺织工业原料的计划规格相适应），但是今后应该尽一切可能力求改进。纺织部门亦应和贸易部门加强联系，深入了解棉花供应的实际情况，尽力克服生产过程中的困难。
