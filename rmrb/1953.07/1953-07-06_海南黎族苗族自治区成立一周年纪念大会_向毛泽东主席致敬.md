    Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region Celebrates First Anniversary; Salutes Chairman Mao Zedong

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The People's Government of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Guangdong Province held a celebration meeting for the first anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region on July 3rd in Buyou City, Ledong County.

    Hu Guozhen (Li nationality), member of the People's Government of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region and chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening speech. He outlined the achievements made in the fields of politics, economy, culture, and health since the establishment of the autonomous region a year ago. He called on all Li and Miao people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, to continue to advance towards a better future together with their brothers of all ethnic groups.

    The masses present warmly welcomed Vice Chairman Feng Baiju, who led the people of all ethnic groups on Hainan Island in more than 20 years of revolutionary struggle, to speak. Feng Baiju conveyed the care of the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government of Guangdong Province for the Li and Miao people, and praised the revolutionary spirit of the Li and Miao people and the various achievements of the autonomous region over the past year. He said that the face of the autonomous region has gradually changed, and the people of all ethnic groups have begun a happy life. This is inseparable from Chairman Mao's concern and the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups.

    Feng Baiju and Tan Tiandu, head of the working group of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, presented a large number of gifts such as towels and soap to the Li and Miao people present on behalf of the People's Government of Guangdong Province.

    The commemoration meeting ended in cheers after passing a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The text of the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, we, on behalf of the 270,000 Li and Miao people in the entire region, would like to extend our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to you—our most beloved leader and mentor.

    Over the past year, thanks to your and the Central People's Government's infinite care and the patient assistance of Han cadres, the poor and backward historical appearance of the autonomous region has been greatly changed. At present, social order in the entire region is unprecedentedly stable, ethnic unity is increasing day by day, and agriculture production, cultural education, health and other undertakings have all developed rapidly. As a result, the lives of people of all ethnic groups have been generally improved, and a new and prosperous atmosphere is emerging everywhere in the region. We can never forget the monstrous crimes of the reactionary ruling classes of the past. They drove us to the remote mountains and uninhabited poor villages, making us live in hunger and cold for generations. The Kuomintang reactionaries slaughtered tens of millions of our compatriots with savage and inhumane means. They attempted to subdue us with slaughter. However, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after a long period of struggle, victory was finally achieved, thus ushering in a new era in the history of the Li and Miao people.

    Respected Chairman Mao: We deeply feel that our happiness today is inseparable from your name and your great and brilliant ethnic policy. Your name is an inexhaustible force that inspires us to move forward. We firmly guarantee to you: We will continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition in the future, always unite around you and the Communist Party, and work unremittingly to consolidate the national defense of the motherland and build a bright and splendid motherland.

    Finally, we wish you a long life.

    海南黎族苗族自治区成立一周年纪念大会
    向毛泽东主席致敬
    据新华社讯：广东省海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府于七月三日在乐东县布由市举行自治区成立一周年纪念大会。
    大会主席海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府委员胡国珍（黎族）致开会词。他概述了自治区成立一年来在政治、经济、文化、卫生等方面所获得的成绩。他要求全体黎族、苗族人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，和各族兄弟一道向着美好的未来继续前进。
    到会群众热烈欢迎领导海南岛各族人民进行二十多年革命斗争的冯白驹副主席讲话。冯白驹传达了中共中央华南分局和广东省人民政府对黎族苗族人民的关怀，并赞扬黎族、苗族人民的革命精神和自治区一年来的各项成就。他说，自治区的面貌已逐步改观了，各族人民已开始了幸福的生活，这是和毛主席的关怀、各族人民的努力分不开的。
    冯白驹和广东省人民政府工作团团长谭天度代表广东省人民政府赠送大批毛巾、肥皂等礼物给到会的黎族、苗族人民。
    纪念大会在欢呼声中通过了向毛主席、中国人民志愿军的致敬电后结束。
    大会向毛主席致敬电的电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在海南黎族苗族自治区成立一周年的日子，我们谨代表全区二十七万黎族、苗族人民向您——我们最敬爱的领袖和导师致以最崇高的敬礼和衷心的感激。
    一年来，由于您和中央人民政府的无限关怀和汉族干部的耐心帮助，自治区贫穷落后的历史面貌已大为改观。目前，全区社会秩序空前安定，民族团结日益加强，农业生产、文化教育、卫生等事业都获得迅速发展。因而各族人民的生活已普遍改善，全区到处呈现一片欣欣向荣的新气象。我们永远不能忘记历代反动统治阶级的滔天罪恶。他们把我们赶到深山峻岭，荒无人烟的穷乡僻壤，使我们世世代代过着饥寒交迫的日子。国民党反动派以灭绝人性的野蛮手段，屠杀了我们数以千万计的同胞。他们企图以屠杀来制服我们。但是在中国共产党的英明领导下，经过长期斗争，终于取得了胜利，从而开始了黎族、苗族人民历史的新纪元。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们深深地感到我们今天的幸福，是和您的名字分不开的，是和您伟大光辉的民族政策分不开的。您的名字是鼓舞我们前进的无穷力量。我们坚决向您保证：我们今后将继续发扬革命传统，永远团结在您和共产党的周围，为巩固祖国的国防和建设光辉灿烂的祖国而努力不懈。
    最后，祝您万寿无疆。
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治区成立一周年纪念大会一九五三年七月三日
