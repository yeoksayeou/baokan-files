With the rising tide of the world peace movement, the friendship and cultural and economic relations between the Chinese and Indian people have undergone new development. This time, the All-India Peace Council has organized an Indian Art Delegation, including outstanding Indian writers, poets, artists, dancers, and musicians, to come to our country. This is proof of the further development of peace and friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. We believe that the visit and performances of the Indian Art Delegation in China will further deepen the understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. The deepening of friendship between the Chinese and Indian people and the common desire and concerted efforts of the two major nations for peace will make a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world."

    Sachin Sengupta, the head of the delegation, then delivered a speech, expressing his joy at being able to visit New China. He said, "The Chinese people have now obtained a free and beautiful life. We have been paying attention to China's progress and have been wondering why China has had such amazing changes in just three short years. After arriving in China and seeing the spirit of Chinese young men and women serving the people, we have begun to discover where the great strength of your country lies." Sachin Sengupta praised China's contributions and excellent traditions in culture and art. He finally expressed his desire to exchange the culture of the Chinese and Indian peoples to promote world peace.

    Among the delegation, the famous old Indian poet Vallathol Narayana Menon also spoke at the meeting. He passionately expressed the Indian people's desire for peace. He said: "We must unite to make war forever a noun that can only exist in dictionaries." He also presented two of his own works to the China People's Committee for World Peace.

    The banquet proceeded throughout in a friendly atmosphere.
