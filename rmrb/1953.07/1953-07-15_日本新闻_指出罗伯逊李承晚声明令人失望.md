    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 14th: The "Japan News" pointed out on the 14th that the joint statement by Robertson and Rhee Syngman was "vague and disappointing." The newspaper said: "Regardless of whether they made verbal assurances in private, the explicit and implicit reservations made in the official joint statement issued by these two negotiators will obviously arouse suspicion and criticism." The newspaper said: "Undoubtedly, nothing in this statement formally makes President Rhee Syngman concede much on his consistent claims, demands, and threats, let alone deny them."

    “日本新闻”指出罗伯逊李承晚声明令人失望
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：“日本新闻”十四日指出：罗伯逊和李承晚的联合声明是“含糊的和令人失望的”。该报说：“不管他们私下有没有提出口头的保证，在这两位谈判代表所发表的正式联合声明中所作的公开的和不公开的保留，显然是会引起猜疑和批评的。”该报说：“无疑，在这个声明中并没有说过任何的话会正式使李承晚总统对他一贯提出的主张、要求和威胁作多大的让步，更不必说否认它们了。”
