    Chickens and Ducks Should Not Be Transported on Baggage-Postal Cars
    A letter from the Shanghai Post Office Transportation Department Committee of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union: Currently, on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Nanjing-Wuhu, and Beijing-Shanghai lines, it is frequently found that railway bureaus are using the spare space in baggage-postal cars to transport poultry such as chickens and ducks. This not only makes the carriages noisy, but also the urine and feces are all over the floor, and the stench is unbearable, which is extremely unhygienic. The postal escorts on the train suffer greatly. The relevant railway bureaus also do not pay attention to cleaning these postal cars that have been used to transport poultry. The cars still have a foul smell the next time they transport mail. The Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin post offices have repeatedly contacted the relevant railway bureaus to request improvements in the carriage hygiene of baggage-postal cars, and have even submitted requests to the Ministry of Railways through higher authorities, but the problem has not been resolved. It is currently summer, and it is hoped that the Ministry of Railways will quickly pay attention to this issue and promptly take effective measures to prohibit the transportation of poultry in baggage-postal cars.

    行李邮政车上不应装运鸡鸭
    中国邮电工会上海邮局运输处委员会来信：目前在沪宁线、宁芜线、京沪线上，经常发现铁路局利用行李邮政车的空余地位来装运鸡鸭等家禽。这样，车厢内不但声音嘈杂，而且尿屎满地、恶臭难闻，极不卫生。邮局的押运员在车上很不好受。有关路局对这些曾经装过家禽的邮车也不注意打扫，在下一次运送邮件时，车内仍有臭气。上海、南京和天津邮局曾一再与有关路局联系，要求改善行李邮政车的车间卫生，并曾通过上级向铁道部提出，但问题一直没有解决。目前正是夏季，希望铁道部赶快重视这个问题，迅速采取有效措施，禁止在行李邮政车内运送家禽。
