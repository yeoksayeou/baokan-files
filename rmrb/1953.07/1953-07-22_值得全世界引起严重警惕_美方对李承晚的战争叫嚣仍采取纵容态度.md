Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 21st. (Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) As the Korean armistice is filled with renewed hope due to the firm efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, the reactions of Syngman Rhee and the United States deserve serious vigilance from the whole world.

    Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, declared for the second consecutive day that the United States had agreed that if the political conference failed to achieve Syngman Rhee's goal of "unifying Korea" after ninety days, the United States would withdraw from the political conference. Pyun Yung-tai said that if the United States did not keep this promise, "the South Korean government feels no obligation not to obstruct the armistice." At the same time, news came that Syngman Rhee was preparing to issue a statement overturning Harrison's guarantee to the Korean and Chinese sides that "the armistice has no time limit." The news said that Syngman Rhee was waiting for the United States to provide concrete guarantees on how to "unify Korea" after the failure of the political conference.

    The United States State Department's propaganda machine is chiming in for Syngman Rhee. United Press Vice President Kingsbury Smith, on the one hand, admitted that "the United Nations forces have been defeated in the propaganda war in Panmunjom" and that "billions of people around the world only see the communist side's views"; but at the same time, he took on a Don Quixote-like task, attempting to reverse the defeat. Kingsbury Smith knew he lacked the capital, and his only way was to spread rumors. He tried to give the impression that Harrison had not said the phrase "the armistice has no time limit" at the conference table. Kingsbury Smith tried to make people believe that Harrison's guarantee was merely "propaganda" from the Korean and Chinese sides. But Kingsbury Smith's efforts were in vain. U.S. delegation spokesman Hull had already admitted on the 19th that the words of Harrison quoted in General Nam Il's statement were all correct and "extracted from official secret records." Obviously, it is impossible to overturn the guarantees already made by Harrison and recorded.

    The Syngman Rhee clique is now openly denying that they had such a "guarantee," but the United States has not come out to say a word, and is continuing to adopt a tolerant and permissive attitude toward Syngman Rhee's clamoring. The whole world now clearly sees the huge danger hidden behind this attitude of the United States. The British "Manchester Guardian" said on the 20th: "What Syngman Rhee will do in the next few months remains a question." The "Manchester Guardian's" suspicion is completely justified. The whole world is now closely watching the United States to prove with actions whether they will abandon the guarantees they made at the negotiating table and continue to tolerate Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice, or strictly implement these guarantees so that all the terms of the armistice agreement are fully implemented.

### 值得全世界引起严重警惕  美方对李承晚的战争叫嚣仍采取纵容态度

    值得全世界引起严重警惕
    美方对李承晚的战争叫嚣仍采取纵容态度
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在这朝鲜停战由于朝中方面的坚定努力而重新充满了希望的时候，李承晚和美国方面的反应是值得全世界严重警惕的。
    李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰接连第二天宣称，美国已经同意：如果政治会议在九十天之后还不能使李承晚达到他的“统一朝鲜”的目的，美国就退出政治会议。卞荣泰说，如果美国不遵守这个诺言，“韩国政府觉得没有不阻挠停战的义务”。同时有消息说，李承晚准备发表一个声明，推翻哈利逊向朝中方面提供的“停战没有时间限制”的保证。消息说，李承晚正在等待美国方面对于政治会议失败后如何使李承晚“统一朝鲜”提出具体保证。
    美国国务院的宣传机器正为李承晚帮腔。合众社的副社长霍布雷奇特一方面承认“在板门店的宣传战中联合国军方面打了败仗”，“世界上亿万人民都只看到共方的意见”；但同时，他又负担起唐·吉诃德式的任务，企图扭转败局。霍布雷奇特明知他缺乏本钱，他唯一的办法就是大肆造谣。他企图给人一种印象，好像哈利逊并没有在会议桌上说过“停战没有时间限制”这句话。霍布雷奇特企图使人相信，哈利逊提出的这个保证只不过是朝中方面的“宣传”。可是霍布雷奇特的这种努力是枉然的。美方代表团发言人赫尔在十九日就已经承认，南日大将声明中所引的哈利逊的话都是正确的，“都是官方秘密记录中摘录下来的”。很明显，要想推翻记录在案的哈利逊已经提出的保证，是不可能的。
    李承晚集团现在公开否认他们有过这样的“保证”，而美方却没有出来讲一句话，而且正在对李承晚这种叫嚣继续采取纵容听任的态度。全世界现在都已经清楚地看到了隐藏在美国这种态度后面的巨大危险性。英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”在二十日说：“李承晚在今后几个月中要做些什么仍然是个疑问。”“曼彻斯特卫报”的这种怀疑是完全有理由的。全世界现在正在密切注视着美方用行动来证明：他们将要背弃他们在谈判桌上所作的保证，继续纵容李承晚破坏停战呢？还是严格执行这些保证，使停战协定条款全部得到实施呢？
