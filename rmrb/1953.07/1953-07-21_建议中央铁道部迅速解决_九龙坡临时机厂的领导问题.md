    Suggest the Central Ministry of Railways Swiftly Resolve the Leadership Problem at the Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory
    A letter from Pan Liang, Cui Dong'an, and six other workers at the Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway: Our factory was originally the Jiulonggang Factory under the Jinan Railway Administration. In August 1951, we were ordered to relocate to the Southwest to participate in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Because the factory buildings in Chengdu had not been built, we merged with the Jiulongpo Locomotive Repair Team of the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau to form the "Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory." After the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was completed, the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau was abolished, and our factory was placed under the administration of the Chongqing Railway Management Sub-bureau (now the Chongqing Railway Bureau). However, the bureau is unwilling to lead our factory. When the bureau made the 1953 production and financial plan, they did not include our factory in the plan. Vice Factory Director Chai Lantian has repeatedly approached the bureau leaders to request the assignment of tasks and clarification of leadership relations, but the bureau said that they would not manage our factory's business plan and that we should solicit business ourselves or ask the Ministry of Railways to resolve the issue. In May of this year, comrades Luo Gang, Pan Liang, and Chen Jusheng went to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Railways replied that they would issue an official letter to instruct us later. However, by the end of June, the problem still had not been resolved. Fortunately, Factory 507 recently signed a batch of roof beam processing contracts with our factory, so our factory can barely maintain operations.
    Because our factory is in a state of no leadership and the higher authorities do not assign tasks, 40% of the workers have no work to do, and many machines are piled up in the machine shed; only 60% of the installed machines are in use.
    Our country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and this kind of waste of machinery and manpower cannot be allowed. It is suggested that the Central Ministry of Railways conduct a prompt inspection to correct this phenomenon that harms national interests.

### 建议中央铁道部迅速解决  九龙坡临时机厂的领导问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建议中央铁道部迅速解决
    九龙坡临时机厂的领导问题
    成渝铁路九龙坡临时机厂职工潘亮、崔东安等八人来信：我厂原来是济南铁路管理局九龙岗工厂，一九五一年八月奉命迁厂到西南参加成渝铁路的建设。因为成都的厂房一直没有盖好，当时我们就与西南铁路工程局九龙坡机车装修大队合并成立“九龙坡临时机厂”。成渝铁路建设完成后，西南铁路工程局撤销，我厂改由重庆铁路管理分局（即现在的重庆铁路局）代管。但该局不愿领导我们这个厂。该局做一九五三年生产财务计划时，就没有把我们厂列在计划内。我厂柴兰田副厂长为此曾多次找局首长要求布置任务和明确领导关系，该局却说他们不管我厂经营计划，要我们自行承揽生意或请示铁道部解决。今年五月间，我厂罗岗、潘亮、陈菊生三位同志曾到北京去向铁道部请示。铁道部的答复是：以后会有公函指示我们。但是直到六月底，问题仍旧没有解决。最近幸有五○七厂和我厂订立了一批房梁加工合同，我厂才勉强维持下去。
    由于我们厂处在无人领导的状态中，上级也不给予任务，以致有百分之四十的工人没有工作做，很多部机器被积压在机器棚里；已经安装好的机器也只有百分之六十在使用。
    我们国家正在进行大规模经济建设，这种浪费机器和人力的现象是不能允许的。建议中央铁道部迅速进行检查，纠正这种损害国家利益的现象。
