Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 18th: The Syngman Rhee gang's action of searching for cannon fodder in various parts of South Korea to expand the puppet army has met with strong resistance from the South Korean people, and is therefore proceeding extremely poorly. News from Seoul says that the Syngman Rhee gang has racked its brains to capture "strong men," but has still failed to reach even one-third of the originally planned number. Therefore, the puppet Ministry of National Defense and the puppet Ministry of Internal Affairs have added "special search teams" to search everywhere for people evading military service and forcibly grabbing men. According to the Seoul "Chosun Ilbo" report: In Seoul, the number of men captured by the "special search team" has reached 9,476, but even so, the plan to collect cannon fodder still cannot be completed.

In order to expand the army for war, the Rhee gang ferociously grabbed teenagers and old people to use as cannon fodder. On April 8 this year, the puppet government issued a so-called "voluntary military service order," to grab all "strong men" between the ages of seventeen and fifty-five to form "labor service divisions" and send them to the front line to serve as cannon fodder. To this end, every puppet policeman was ordered to capture a certain number of "strong men." As a result, many white-haired old men were also arrested. According to the "Chosun Ilbo," in June alone, in the Dongnae area of ​​Gyeongsangnam-do, there were 276 old people over the age of 60 who were arrested and sent to the "replenishment team."

Young people throughout South Korea generally resist the Syngman Rhee gang's conscription by running away, concealing their age, changing their names, or not registering their household. According to statistics from the Seoul puppet "District Court," cases of violating the puppet "Military Service Law" account for 20 percent of the total number of cases.

    李承晚匪帮强征炮灰的行动受到南朝鲜人民的强烈抵抗
    【新华社平壤十八日电】李承晚匪帮在南朝鲜各地搜罗炮灰以扩大伪军的行动，受到南朝鲜人民强烈的抵抗，因而进行得极不顺利。来自汉城的消息说，李承晚匪帮费尽心机抓捕“壮丁”，但仍未能达到原计划数字的三分之一。因此，伪国防部和伪内务部增编“特别搜索队”，到处搜索逃避兵役的人和强抓壮丁。据汉城的“朝鲜日报”报道：在汉城市，被“特别搜索队”抓去的壮丁已有九千四百七十六名，虽然如此，搜罗炮灰的计划仍然无法完成。
    李匪帮为了扩充军队进行战争，穷凶极恶地把少年和老人也都抓去当炮灰。今年四月八日，伪政府颁布了一项所谓“志愿兵役命令”，要把十七岁到五十五岁的“壮丁”全部抓去，组成“劳务师团”，送到前线去充当炮灰。为此，每个伪警察奉命必须抓到若干“壮丁”。结果，许多白发老翁也被抓去。据“朝鲜日报”透露：在六月份，仅庆尚南道东莱地区，被抓到“补充队”的六十岁以上的老人就有二百七十六名。
    南朝鲜各地青年普遍地用逃跑、隐瞒年龄、改换姓名或不登记户口的办法来抵抗李匪帮的征兵。据汉城伪“地方法院”的统计，违犯伪“兵役法”的案件，占案件总数的百分之二十。
