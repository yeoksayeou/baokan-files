    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 6th: French newspapers report that Mr. Depla, the head of the French Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, which recently signed a trade agreement with the China National Import and Export Corporation in Beijing, held a press conference upon returning to Paris. At the press conference, Depla pointed out the broad representation of the French Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, which included representatives from various industrial and commercial sectors that could greatly benefit from expanding relations with China.
    Depla, when discussing the issue of obtaining export licenses for goods in the contract, pointed out that the American embargo policy caused difficulties for French exporters. He said, "I believe that France, as a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, would be dishonorable if it yielded to the United States and prohibited the export of medicines, especially antibacterial drugs, to China."
    When talking about the prospects of Franco-Chinese trade, Depla emphasized: Trade agreements concluded with China on an equal basis are of great benefit to the French economy. He said, "Such agreements allow us to export goods that have no outlets elsewhere, and can greatly save US dollars. China buys goods from us that we cannot sell in the dollar area, and it supplies us with goods that we need, and are actually goods that we must buy with US dollars or pounds sterling."
    Depla said that because China is carrying out its first five-year economic construction plan, the needs of the Chinese people provide great opportunities for the development of certain French industries.
    Depla also spoke about the impressions gained from the delegation's visit to China. He said that the delegation members were very satisfied with the trip. They personally witnessed the enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people. They also noted the measures taken by the Chinese authorities to promote national culture and preserve Chinese historical relics.

    法国工商业贸易代表团团长在巴黎对记者谈
    中法贸易对法国经济有巨大利益
    【新华社布拉格六日电】法国报纸报道，最近在北京和中国进出口公司签订了贸易协定的法国工商业贸易代表团团长德普拉，在回到巴黎后举行了记者招待会。德普拉在记者招待会上指出法国工商业贸易代表团的广泛代表性，它包括了从扩展对中国的关系中可以获得巨大利益的各方面工商界代表。
    德普拉谈到怎样获得合同中的货物出口许可证问题时指出，美国的禁运政策使法国出口商遇到困难。他说：“我认为作为日内瓦公约签字国的法国，如果屈从美国而禁止向中国输出药品，特别是抗菌药品，那是不光荣的。”
    德普拉谈到法、中贸易的前景时强调：与中国在平等基础上缔结的贸易协定，对法国经济有巨大利益。他说：“这种协定使那些在其他地方没有销路的货物可以输出，并且可以大大节省美元。中国购买我们无法在美元区出售的货物，它供应我们的，是我们必需的货物，而且实际上是我们必须用美元或英镑购买的货物。”
    德普拉说：由于中国正在进行第一个五年经济建设计划，中国人民的需要使某些法国工业有很大发展的机会。
    德普拉还谈到代表团这次访问中国所得的印象。他说，代表团人员对于这次旅行感到非常满意。他们亲眼看到中国人民所表现的热情。他们还注意到中国当局为发扬民族文化和保存中国历代文物而采取的措施。
