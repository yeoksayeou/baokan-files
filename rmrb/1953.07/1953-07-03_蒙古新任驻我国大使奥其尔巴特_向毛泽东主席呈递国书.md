Dorji, First Secretary Purbuzhal, Second Secretary Ailing Qingsu Nuomu, and Third Secretary Gursd, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government at 7:00 PM on the 2nd. Present at the ceremony were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Huang Kecheng, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; Chen Jiakang, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department. When Ambassador Ochirbat presented his credentials, he delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a response.

    Ambassador Ochirbat's Eulogy:
    Respected Chairman,

    I am extremely honored to present to you the credentials from the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China.

    Chairman, as I present my credentials, please allow me to convey to you, and through you to the great Chinese people and their government, the most sincere, friendly greetings and heartfelt congratulations of the Mongolian people and their government.

    The victory of the great Chinese people over the Kuomintang bandit troops and their protectors, a victory of world-historical significance, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, have opened a new era of fraternal friendship and close cooperation in the history of relations between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples, a friendship based on the Leninist-Stalinist principles of friendship among peoples.

    The tremendous achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong in all aspects of building a new people's democratic China are achievements for the entire democratic camp, headed by the great Soviet Union—our common friend. These achievements of great Chinese people and the ever-strengthening friendship and cooperation between our two peoples have always evoked deep, sincere, and joyous feelings in the hearts of the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic, both in the past and present.

    I feel very honored to represent my government in our friendly People's Republic of China. I assure you that all my activities will be devoted to further and fully consolidating and developing the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Mongolian people and the great Chinese people—a powerful force for safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world.

    I firmly believe that in carrying out this noble and honorable mission, I will receive your assistance and support from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

    For the welfare and happiness of the great Chinese people, for the great cause of consolidating world peace, I heartily wish you, Chairman, good health and longevity.

    Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply:
    Ambassador,

    I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by you from the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.

    Over the past three years, the friendly cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic have achieved great development and consolidation. The Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed last year by the governments of China and Mongolia has not only further strengthened this friendly cooperative relationship between our two countries, but has also greatly promoted the friendship and happiness of our two peoples.

    The Mongolian people have already made tremendous achievements in construction. These achievements have always been deeply cared for and praised by the Chinese people. I firmly believe that the increasingly close unity between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples will inevitably strengthen our forces for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, and make the world peace, democracy, and socialism camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, even more consolidated.

    Ambassador, I warmly welcome you as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Mongolian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China. In your work to consolidate the friendly cooperation between China and Mongolia, you will receive my full support and the full support of the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    I wish you complete success in your work.
