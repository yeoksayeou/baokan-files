    "The Great Citizen" is an excellent film filled with a fighting spirit from beginning to end and is profoundly educational for us. It profoundly reflects how the Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik) waged a sharp struggle against the people's enemies, the Trotskyite and Zinovievite gangs, during the period from 1925 to 1934. We know that after the end of the domestic war, the Soviet state began to implement the New Economic Policy in the spring of 1921. The purpose of the New Economic Policy was not only to restore the national economy of Russia, which had been devastated by seven years of war, but also to maintain and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, so as to defeat the capitalist elements in urban and rural areas and build a socialist society. The Trotskyites and other opposition factions fundamentally did not understand the essence of the New Economic Policy, believing that the New Economic Policy was only a "retreat" and a "return to capitalism." They did not believe in the prospects of socialist construction. They ridiculed the policy of national industrialization and fundamentally denied the possibility of achieving victory in socialist construction in a single country. They tried every possible means to sabotage this great construction undertaking, gradually degenerating from a political faction within the working class into a gang of unprincipled assassins, spies, and murderers. However, under the wise leadership of Stalin, the Soviet people waged a resolute struggle against these reactionary elements until they were completely eliminated, and successfully built a socialist society.

    On the screen, we see the implementers of the Party line, represented by Shakhov, engaged in an irreconcilable struggle with the Trotskyite elements represented by Kartashov, Borovsky, and others. The film gradually unfolds and deepens this struggle through many dramatic and tense scenes of debates, speeches, and meetings. Generally speaking, films with so many scenes of speeches and meetings can easily become tedious if not handled well. However, due to the film's great and moving content and the power of its vivid language, audiences develop a special interest in it. The struggle between revolution and counterrevolution, the struggle between creative activity and destructive activity, runs through the entire film like a red thread. Every meeting, every speech, every debate is filled with the atmosphere of fiery struggle. For example, the scene of Shakhov arguing with Kartashov late at night is very interesting. Shakhov sharply refuted Kartashov's absurd remarks, exposed the reactionary essence of the Trotskyite elements, and promoted the great idea that socialism can be built in one country. This is not empty preaching, but a true portrayal of the fiery struggle of reality. At the beginning, the enemy wanted to use the name of inner-Party struggle to engage in sophistry, seize the masses, oppose the Party, oppose the Party Central Committee, and achieve their despicable aims. They wanted to use the trick of "luring the tiger away from the mountain" to send Nikov away to "study," insisting that this was what "the Party thought should be done." They openly slandered Shakhov's uncompromising spirit in upholding the Party's principles as "an act against the Party," "dissatisfaction with the Party," and "factionalism against the organization." But their actual conspiracy, as Kartashov said in private, was: "To achieve our goals under their slogans." However, under the wise perception of Shakhov and others, and under the resolute rebuttal of Maxim, the representative of the Central Supervisory Committee, their ugly features were exposed. Their attempt to overthrow Shakhov, who resolutely fought for the line of Lenin and Stalin, resulted in their failure. Shakhov's mother's speech at the Party congress in defense of the Party's interests is extremely moving. "Everyone has his own ideal, and everyone hopes to have a happy family. However, our family had nothing but looms, hardship, and anger... Therefore, I understood that there must be a revolution. And we must fight to the end. Some people here know that I have handed over three people—my husband and two sons. I only have one Shakhov left. He hasn't read much, but he has heard the sound of shackles and handcuffs; he has heard how the gendarmes came to knock on the door at night; he has heard the screams of people before they died on the guillotine. I rarely told him these things, but he knows how his brothers died; he knows why his father went to serve in the army... He knows about my hatred and pain as a mother! Now I am very happy, my son, my Shakhov is fighting for the cause of his working class, and is fighting for a communist society at all costs!" This voice not only represents the feelings of a great mother, but also represents the feelings of the entire Russian working class. She depicts the revolutionary Shakhov, and also depicts the entire Russian working class who had been in the arduous struggle.

    Of course, the film is not limited to speeches, meetings, and debates, and does not simplify the struggle. Instead, it combines the Party's leadership with the actions of the masses from the broad social struggle, and constantly expands and deepens the conflicts in the drama, thoroughly exposing the criminal activities of the Trotskyite reactionary elements, and portraying the correctness and victory of the Party's policy line. We see that the Party resolutely supports the rationalization proposals and new operation methods of advanced workers, the Party leads the Red Metallurgical Factory to complete the first domestic tractor, the Party leads the great and magnificent canal construction project, and the Party carries out criticism of conservative and complacent elements. But on the other hand, the Trotskyite reactionary elements tried every means to sabotage the Party, betray the motherland and the people, sabotage the country's economic construction, and assassinate leading Party cadres... What is the result of this struggle? As Shakhov once said: They can deceive one person, and they can threaten one person, but they cannot deceive tens of thousands of Bolsheviks. This is never possible. The Bolshevik Party has established a new life and realized the ideals of mankind for centuries. Whoever wants to block its path and try to stop our work will be eliminated by the people, and resolutely eliminated by the victorious people.

    The reason why this film is particularly educational is that the authors have created living, positive typical characters worthy of learning from. The protagonist, Shakhov, this great citizen, has infinite loyalty to the cause of communism, consistently adheres to the principles of Leninism, and resolutely implements the Party's policies. He has great ideals and firm beliefs, clear love and hate, keen senses, and profound thoughts. He maintains close contact with the masses, and he resolutely supports the creativity of the masses. He is a thinker, a seasoned organizer, and a brilliant propagandist and mobilizer; he actively leads the cause of socialist construction, and wages an irreconcilable struggle against the reactionary elements, until he dedicates his precious life. Comrade Stalin once said that communists are people "made of special material," and the various characteristics possessed by such people are concentratedly manifested in the perfect image of Shakhov. We see on the screen the debate between Shakhov and Kartashov about the future of socialism late at night. From Kartashov's slandering of the Party's current political line, Shakhov concluded that Kartashov and others' opposition to the rationalization proposals of the workers was rooted. He saw clearly that what Kartashov was vehemently opposing was not just Shakhov alone, but that he was engaged in a series of heinous anti-Party activities. In another scene, when Shakhov dismissed the chief engineer Avdeyev, who had been bought over by the Trotskyite elements, Shakhov keenly and vigilantly judged that the enemy was operating secretly, and was attacking the Party in a planned way. He was distressed, pondered deeply, and wanted to find out what the enemy's intentions were, and the facts proved that his judgment was correct.

    Due to the leakage of the news of the forester Ivan's surrender, and the destruction of part of the canal project, the Trotskyite element and spy Chemirov, who was buried deepest, had infiltrated the core of the Party's leadership, and served as the second secretary of the District Committee, was finally exposed. Shakhov gradually matured in the sharp political struggle. He cleverly, keenly, and resolutely dug out the enemy from the deepest places. The film made a detailed and moving portrayal of this complex struggle. The actor Bogolyubov, who played Shakhov, made a successful performance of the complex thoughts and emotional changes of the characters in this struggle, so that the great image of the living Bolshevik will always remain in our hearts.

    Surrounding Shakhov, the film's authors also made realistic and vivid descriptions of the characters of Nikov, Katz, Nadya, Dubok, and other positive characters. Dubok gradually became the director of the Red Metallurgical Factory from an ordinary worker under the Party's education and training, and through training and improvement in actual struggle. Nadya is a young female worker who gradually grew up under Shakhov's tutelage and became a vigorous new fighting force. The noble qualities of the Soviet younger generation are reflected in her. She bravely put forward new proposals for the construction of the canal project, fought against the conservative and complacent Dubok, and finally replaced Dubok as the director of the Red Metallurgical Factory. The scene in the film where Dubok could not conduct self-criticism and pretended to be sick at home, and Nadya went to see Dubok, is very humane and principled. When Nadya repeatedly called "Uncle Dubok" and wanted to discuss with him how to make a report on the factory's work, but Dubok wanted to drive Nadya away, Nadya seriously criticized Dubok and conveyed what Shakhov had said to him: "So-called self-criticism is the basic spirit of the Soviet people. It is a shame for anyone who cannot overcome their selfishness and complacency. Such a person is not a Bolshevik." Dubok finally repented and received her kindly. Nadya's spirit of creative labor has had a profound and widespread impact among young workers and has become a model for young people to follow. Why is she like this? Let's listen to her speech at the shock worker conference: "The basic principles taught to us by the Party, the basic principles taught to us by Comrade Stalin, and the basic principles we learned in the Red Metallurgical Factory are: Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid of technology, don't be afraid of going beyond the prescribed scope, don't be afraid of breaking off relations with the leaders if they are wrong! For true Bolsheviks, self-criticism will not harm feelings!" She is such a person!

    In contrast to these glorious images, the image of the counterrevolutionary gang appears ugly and small. From the images of Kartashov and Borovsky, we can see that the author's exposure of the enemy is very profound and detailed. The ugly prototype of the Trotskyite elements and their despicable and vicious destructive activities are vividly expressed. The authors achieved great success in the artistic description of these two representative figures of the enemies of the Party and the people, and in the portrayal of different personalities. Kartashov argues with people, gives speeches at meetings, and engages in destructive activities; Borovsky looks more sinister and vicious, and is good at finding contradictions, exploiting loopholes, and plotting conspiracies. But whether Kartashov shouts and gesticulates, or Borovsky walks around the room like a ghost, swallowing pills, or looks coldly, their spiritual collapse, the filth of their souls, and the essence of the murderous criminals are fully revealed, arousing the deep hatred of the audience. The actor Berseniev, who played Kartashov, and the actor Chakov, who played Borovsky, successfully created the image of the enemy with mature acting skills and a profound sense of Party spirit.

    This film is of great educational significance to our country's audiences. Although the current situation in our country is different from that in the Soviet Union at that time, the film is of great inspiration and encouragement to us. We must be vigilant against the sabotage of our country's economic construction by imperialism and its running dogs. Let us learn from Shakhov, the "Great Citizen," learn from his noble Bolshevik qualities, learn from his fighting spirit in adhering to the Party's policy line, and learn from his revolutionary optimism that is not afraid of all difficulties.

    为列宁、斯大林的路线而斗争
    ——推荐苏联影片“伟大的公民”

    编剧：勃利依马那、鲍耳欣卓伐、爱尔姆列尔
    导演：爱尔姆列尔  副导演：密那凯尔  翻译：陈  涓
    苏联列宁电影制片厂出品上海电影制片厂配音复制
    “伟大的公民”是一部自始至终充满着战斗精神的、对我们富有深刻教育意义的优秀影片，曾荣获一九四一年斯大林奖金。这部影片深刻地反映了苏联共产党（布）在一九二五年至一九三四年这一时期，怎样跟人民公敌托洛茨基、季诺维也夫等匪帮进行了尖锐的斗争。我们知道，苏维埃国家在国内战争结束后，于一九二一年春季开始实行了新经济政策。新经济政策的目的，不仅是为了恢复当时俄国被七年战争弄得破烂不堪的国民经济，而且是为了保持和巩固在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，以战胜城乡中的资本主义成分和建成社会主义社会。托洛茨基分子及其他反对派分子则根本不了解新经济政策的实质，认为新经济政策只是一种“退却”，是“回复到资本主义”。他们不相信社会主义建设的前途。他们讥笑国家工业化的政策，根本否认在单独一个国家内取得社会主义建设胜利的可能。他们千方百计地破坏这种伟大的建设事业，逐渐由工人阶级中的一个政派而蜕变为一小伙毫无原则的暗害者、间谍和杀人凶手的匪帮。然而苏联人民却在斯大林的英明领导下，同这些反动分子进行了坚决的斗争，直至彻底将他们消灭，并胜利地建成了社会主义社会。
    在银幕上，我们看到以沙霍夫为代表的党的路线的执行者，同以卡尔塔萧夫、鲍罗夫斯基等为代表的托派分子之间进行了不调和的斗争。影片通过许多争辩、演讲、会议等等富有戏剧性的紧张场面，把这种斗争逐渐展开与深化了。一般地说，演讲、会议场面这样多的影片，如果处理不好，那是很容易使人感到枯燥的。但是由于这部影片的伟大而动人的内容，以及它的生动的语言的力量，反而使观众对它发生特有的兴趣。革命与反革命的斗争，创造活动与破坏活动的斗争，像一根红线一样贯串在全部影片中，每一个会议，每一个演讲，每一次争辩，都充满了火热的斗争气息。例如沙霍夫同卡尔塔萧夫在深夜争辩的场面，就使人发生很大的兴趣。沙霍夫尖锐地驳斥了卡尔塔萧夫的荒谬言论，揭露了托派分子的反动本质，宣扬了在一个国家内可以建成社会主义的伟大思想。这不是空洞的说教，而是现实的火热斗争的真实写照。敌人在开头，原想假借党内斗争的名义进行巧辩，夺取群众，反对党，反对党中央，达到他们的卑鄙企图。他们想用“调虎离山”的办法，把尼柯夫派去“学习”，硬说这是 “党认为要那样做。”他们公开诬蔑沙霍夫坚持党的原则的不妥协的精神是“反对党的行为”，是“对党不满意”，是“跟组织上闹宗派”。而他们的实际阴谋，则如卡尔塔萧夫私下说的：“在他们的口号下，达到我们的目的。”但，在沙霍夫等人明智的觉察下，在中央监察委员会代表马克西姆的坚决回击下，他们的丑态显露了。他们企图打倒为列宁、斯大林路线而坚决斗争的沙霍夫，结果是他们失败了。沙霍夫的母亲为维护党的利益，在党的代表会议上的一段讲话是极其动人的。“每个人都有他自己的理想，谁都希望有个美满的家庭。可是，我们一家人除了织布机，就只有困苦和愤怒……因此我懂得，必须革命。而且要奋斗到底。这里有些人知道，我交出了三个人——丈夫和两个儿子。我只留下了一个沙霍夫。他读书不多，但脚镣手铐的声音，听过；宪兵怎样在晚上来敲门，听过；断头台上人们临死前的喊叫，听过。这些我很少告诉他，但他的兄弟们是怎样死的，他知道；父亲是为什么赶去充军的，他知道……他知道关于我做母亲的仇恨和痛苦！现在我很快乐，我的儿子，我的沙霍夫为自己的工人阶级的事业在斗争，不惜一切牺牲为共产主义社会在斗争！”这声音，不仅代表了一位伟大母亲的感情，而且代表了整个俄国工人阶级的感情，她描绘出了革命的沙霍夫，也描绘出了曾经在艰苦斗争中的整个俄国工人阶级。
    当然，影片没有局限在演讲、会议和争辩之中，没有把斗争简单化，而是从广阔的社会斗争中，将党的领导和群众的行动结合起来，并不断扩大和深化戏剧中的冲突，彻底暴露托派反动分子的罪恶活动，描绘党的政策路线的正确和胜利。我们看到：党坚决支持先进工人的合理化建议和新操作法，党领导赤色冶金工厂完成了第一部国产拖拉机，党领导了伟大壮丽的运河建设工程，党对保守自满的分子开展了批评。可是在另一方面，托派反动分子则千方百计地破坏党，出卖祖国与人民，破坏国家的经济建设，谋杀党的领导干部……。这种斗争结果怎样呢？正如沙霍夫曾经说过的：他们可以欺骗一个人，也可以威胁一个人，但欺骗不了千千万万布尔什维克。这是永远不可能的。布尔什维克党建立了新的生活，实现了几世纪来人类的理想，谁想阻挡它的道路，企图阻止我们的工作，谁就被人民所消灭，被胜利了的人民所坚决消灭。
    这部影片所以特别富有教育意义，就因为作者塑造了值得人们学习的活生生的正面典型人物。主角沙霍夫，这个伟大的公民，对共产主义事业有无限的忠心，一贯坚持列宁主义的原则，坚决执行党的政策。他有伟大的理想和坚强的信念，爱憎分明，感觉敏锐，思想深刻。他和群众保持密切的联系，他坚决支持群众的创造。他是一个思想家、老练的组织家和天才的宣传鼓动家；他积极领导社会主义的建设事业，跟反动分子作了不调和的斗争，直至献出自己宝贵的生命。斯大林同志曾说过，共产党员是“由特殊材料制成的”人，这种人所具有的种种特征，都在沙霍夫的完美的形象中集中地表现出来了。我们在银幕上看到在深夜里沙霍夫和卡尔塔萧夫关于社会主义前途的争辩。沙霍夫从卡尔塔萧夫对当前党的政治路线的污蔑，断定了卡尔塔萧夫等反对工人的合理化建议是有根源的。他看清了卡尔塔萧夫激烈反对的并不是他沙霍夫一个人，而是在做着一系列罪恶的反党活动。在另一场戏里，沙霍夫辞退被托洛茨基分子收买了的总工程师阿符杰叶夫时，沙霍夫敏锐地警觉地，判断敌人是在暗中活动，有计划地在向党进攻。他苦恼着，深思着，想弄清敌人的企图到底是什么，事实证明他的判断是正确的。
    由于看林人伊凡自首的消息被走漏，和部分运河工程的被破坏，埋藏最深的、混进党的领导核心，担任地委会第二书记的托洛茨基分子，间谍捷米卓夫也终于被揭露。沙霍夫在尖锐的政治斗争中逐渐成熟。他机智地、敏锐地、坚决地把敌人从最深的处所挖掘出来。影片对于这种复杂的斗争作了细致、动人的描写。扮演沙霍夫的演员鲍高柳鲍夫，对于在此斗争中人物复杂的思想、感情的变化作了成功的表演，使活生生的布尔什维克的伟大形象，永远留在我们心里。
    环绕着沙霍夫，影片作者对于尼柯夫、卡茨、娜佳、杜鲍克等几个正面人物的性格，也作了真实、生动的描写。杜鲍克由一个普通工人逐渐在党的教育、培养下，在实际的斗争中得到锻炼和提高，最后成为赤色冶金工厂的厂长。娜佳，是一个年轻的女工，在沙霍夫的一手教养下，逐渐成长起来，成为生气勃勃的新的战斗力量。在她身上体现了苏维埃年青一代的高尚品质。她勇敢地提出关于修建运河工程的新的建议，与保守、骄傲自满的杜鲍克斗争，最后代替杜鲍克成为赤色冶金工厂的厂长。影片描写杜鲍克不能进行自我批评，装病在家，娜佳去看杜鲍克的那场戏，是很富有人情味和原则性的。当娜佳连声叫“杜鲍克叔叔”，想与他商量如何作关于该厂的工作报告，而杜鲍克却要赶娜佳走开时，娜佳严肃地批评杜鲍克，把沙霍夫曾经讲过的话转达给他：“所谓自我批评，这是苏联人民的基本精神，谁不会克服自己的自私和自满，是耻辱的，那种人不是布尔什维克。”杜鲍克终于悔悟，友善地接待了她。娜佳的劳动创造精神在青年工人中已起了深刻、广泛的影响，成为青年人效法的榜样。她为什么会这样呢？我们听听她在突击手大会上的演说吧：“党所教导我们的基本法则，斯大林同志所教导我们的基本法则，我们在赤色冶金工厂所学习的基本法则是：不要惧怕！不要惧怕技术，不要惧怕超出了规定的范围，不要惧怕和首长破裂感情，倘使他是错误的话！对于真正的布尔什维克来讲，是不会因为自我批评而损伤感情的！”她便是一个这样的人！
    在这些光辉形象的对照下，反革命匪帮的形象显得丑恶而渺小。从卡尔塔萧夫和鲍罗夫斯基两人的形象中，我们可以看到作者对敌人的揭露是十分深刻而细致的。托派分子的丑恶原形及其卑鄙、毒辣的破坏活动，都被唯妙唯肖地表现出来。作者在处理这两个党和人民的敌人的代表人物时，在艺术的描写，不同性格的刻划上，达到了很大成功。卡尔塔萧夫与人争辩，在会议上演说，进行破坏活动；鲍罗夫斯基看起来更阴狠、毒辣，善于找矛盾、钻空子、策划阴谋。但无论卡尔塔萧夫张牙舞爪地喊叫时，或鲍罗夫斯基像游魂似的在屋里走来走去，吞吃着药丸，或冷冷地望着时，他们精神的溃败，灵魂的龌龊，杀人凶犯的本质都充分地显露出来，唤起了观众的深刻憎恨。扮演卡尔塔萧夫的演员别尔谢聂夫，和扮演鲍罗夫斯基的演员查柯夫，都以成熟的表演技巧和深刻的党性精神，成功地创造了敌人的形象。
    这部影片对于我国的观众有极大的教育意义。虽然我国目前的情况和当时苏联的情况并不相同，但是影片对我们是有很大的启发和鼓舞作用的。我们要警惕帝国主义及其走狗对我国经济建设的破坏。让我们向“伟大的公民”沙霍夫学习吧，学习他的崇高的布尔什维克品质，学习他坚持党的政策路线的战斗精神，学习他不怕一切困难的革命乐观主义。（附图片）
