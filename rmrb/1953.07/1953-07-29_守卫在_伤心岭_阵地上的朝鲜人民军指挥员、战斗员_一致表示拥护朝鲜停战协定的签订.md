Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 28th: Korean People's Army commanders and fighters guarding the "Heartbreak Ridge" position on the eastern front of Korea have expressed unanimous support for the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    Huang Hu, a lieutenant colonel regimental commander of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, who has been guarding the "Heartbreak Ridge" front line for a long time, said after hearing the news of the signing of the armistice agreement on the phone, "The Korean armistice that we have fought for heroically for a long time has finally arrived!"

    For three years, Huang Hu led his troops through hundreds of battles in Yongcheon east of Daegu, the Goseong coast, Bonghwa Peak, Height 845.1, and the heroic "Heartbreak Ridge," annihilating many enemies. After recalling these difficult and glorious days, he said, "Our People's Army, in close cooperation with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, waged an extremely heroic and tenacious struggle against the aggressors, and finally achieved the realization of the Korean armistice with the support of the world's peace forces headed by the Soviet Union. This fact shows that the tenacious and unyielding Korean people cannot be conquered. The US imperialist's evil plan of armed aggression has failed."

    In a stone cave on the front line, Korean People's Army officers sat around a small table, talking about the great achievements of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung in leading the Korean people to build the country and fight back against the American aggressors after the Soviet army liberated northern Korea, thereby achieving the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. They unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely implement the armistice order of Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, strictly abide by the various provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and continue to strive for the peace, democracy, independence, and unification of the motherland.

    Due to the recent frantic opposition to the armistice by the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, the Korean People's Army commanders and fighters here have maintained a high degree of vigilance. Park Kwan-young, a heavy machine gunner and Hero of the Republic who has killed and wounded more than 900 enemies, said: "If the Syngman Rhee puppet army dares to undermine the armistice and carry out provocative incursions, we will resolutely take self-defense actions to ensure the implementation of the various provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement."

    守卫在“伤心岭”阵地上的朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员
    一致表示拥护朝鲜停战协定的签订
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】守卫在朝鲜东线“伤心岭”阵地上的朝鲜人民军指挥员和战斗员们，对朝鲜停战协定的签订表示一致拥护。
    长期守卫在“伤心岭”前线的朝鲜人民军某部中校联队长黄虎从电话中听到停战协定签字的消息以后放下听筒就说：“我们长期英勇奋战所争取的朝鲜停战，终于到来了！”
    三年来黄虎带领着部队，经历过大邱以东的永川、高城海岸、烽火峰、八四五点一高地以及英雄的“伤心岭”等几百次战斗，歼灭了许多敌人。他在回溯这些艰苦而光辉的日子以后说：“我们人民军在兄弟般的中国人民志愿军的密切配合下，对侵略者进行了极其英勇顽强的斗争，终于在以苏联为首的世界和平力量的支援下取得了朝鲜停战的实现。这个事实表明顽强不屈的朝鲜人民是不可被征服的。美帝国主义武装侵略的罪恶计划失败了。”
    在前沿阵地上一个石洞里，朝鲜人民军军官们围坐在一张小桌旁，谈着苏联军队解放了朝鲜北部以后，朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成元帅在领导朝鲜人民建设国家、打退美国侵略者的斗争中的伟大成就，并从而取得了和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步胜利。他们一致表示要坚决执行金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的停战命令，严格遵守朝鲜停战协定的各项条款，继续为祖国的和平、民主、独立和统一而奋斗。
    由于最近李承晚反动集团疯狂叫喊反对停战，这里的朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员们都保持着高度的警惕。曾经打死打伤了九百多敌人的重机枪射手、共和国英雄朴观永说：“如果李承晚伪军敢于破坏停战，进行挑衅进犯，我们将坚决采取自卫的行动，来保障朝鲜停战协定中各项条款的实施。”
