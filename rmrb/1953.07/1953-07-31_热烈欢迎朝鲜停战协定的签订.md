    Warmly Welcome the Signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Czechoslovakia
    On the 28th, all Czechoslovak newspapers published the communique issued by the Korean-Chinese delegation regarding the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the ceasefire orders issued by Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, and the congratulatory telegram from Chairman Malenkov of the Soviet Council of Ministers to Marshal Kim Il-sung. The newspapers also published editorials. "Rude Pravo" stated in its editorial that the Korean armistice was a significant victory for the forces of world peace. The editorial said: "All peace-loving people, millions of peace fighters, are jubilantly welcoming the signing of the armistice agreement, considering it an important step in strengthening world peace and international security. This step also requires us to more actively engage in the struggle to ease international tensions and resolve all disputes through consultation, as in the case of Korea." The editorial expressed respect for the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The editorial pointed out that the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers was an important factor in thwarting the aggression plans and restoring peace in Korea. The editorial, in discussing the need to be vigilant, said: "All peace-loving humanity needs to be vigilant in ensuring that all the terms of the armistice agreement are fulfilled. Today, it remains to be seen whether the American side can fulfill their guarantees for implementing the armistice agreement. At the same time, the US military command must ensure that the armistice agreement is not violated by any of its puppets, regardless of the pretext they use." "People's Defense" stated that the struggle waged by the Korean people, with the fraternal assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are highly praised by peace-loving people all over the world, will be immortalized in history. All those who attempt to infringe upon justice with the crudest and most barbaric actions will receive a warning and a convincing lesson from this historical fact.
     Bulgaria
    In Bulgaria, when the news of the Korean armistice quickly spread through factories and enterprises, Bulgarian workers happily congratulated each other on this great victory for the peace camp. In their enthusiastic discussions, they expressed gratitude for the Soviet Union's peace policy and the heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people. In Sofia, workers at the Telman factory spontaneously held a meeting. Shock worker V. Chenkova said excitedly at the meeting: The people united in the peace camp have achieved a great victory. The American aggressors were forced to end the Korean massacre and sign the armistice agreement. Emini Kotcheva, a Dimitrov Prize winner at a silk factory, said: The signing of the armistice agreement shows that the people's will to fight for peace is invincible. Ilya Pannev, a shock worker at the Georgi Dimitrov Machine Manufacturing Factory, said: This victory opens the door to the peaceful resolution of international disputes. On the 28th, "Otechestven Front" and "Trud" both published editorials on this matter. "Otechestven Front" wrote: The signing of the Korean armistice agreement is a major victory for the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and it also conforms to the vital interests of the people of all countries. This is why all peace-loving people who sincerely hope to stop the threat of new wars are welcoming this news of peace so joyously; this victory has cleared the way for easing international tensions and resolving outstanding international disputes through negotiations. "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial entitled "A Great Victory for Peace and Democracy," saying: The Bulgarian people and all progressive humanity welcome the signing of the Korean armistice agreement with joy. The Bulgarian working people wholeheartedly congratulate the Korean people on the great victory of their just struggle, with the help of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, and wholeheartedly hope that the fraternal Korean people will achieve victory in the work of realizing the reunification of their motherland and rebuilding the country destroyed by barbaric interventionists.
    Romania
    The Romanian newspaper "Scînteia" published an editorial on the 28th, saying: The Korean War is the most direct manifestation of the so-called "policy of strength" advocated by the American aggressive bloc. This bloody war has been contained. Obviously, other contentious issues can and must be resolved through consultation. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a remarkable victory for the forces of peace, and it has ignited the hope of people of all countries for resolving disputes through consultation. The Romanian newspaper "Munca" said in its editorial: The Romanian people pledge to further support the battle-tested Korean people and help them rebuild their war-torn country.
    Aurora Rapun, a Stakhanovite female worker in Bucharest, wrote: We female workers, together with women all over the world, firmly support any proposal that can promote world peace. The female poet Veronica Porumbacu wrote to the famous Korean artist Ahn Sung-hee, describing how joyous the delegates to the World Youth Congress were when they heard the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Academician Stefan Vencov and Horia Hulubei, director of the Institute of Physics of the Romanian People's Republic Academy of Sciences, have published articles welcoming the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    Hungary

"Szabad Nép" wrote: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the peace camp. The newspaper said that since the issue of the Korean armistice can be resolved through negotiations, other disputes can also be resolved in the same way. Workers sent many telegrams to the National Peace Council, expressing their joy upon hearing the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The workers pledged in the telegrams to celebrate this great victory with new production achievements. Factories held meetings one after another to celebrate. At a meeting held on the 28th at the Kliment Gottwald Electrical Equipment Factory in Budapest, twenty-one workers spoke. At the Lenin Metallurgical Plant, Kossuth Prize winner Magas Miszloczki said: The Korean armistice makes Hungarian workers feel gratified, because it proves once again that the strength of the people who uphold peace will surely be victorious. Hungarian writer, Stalin Prize and Kossuth Prize winner Tamás Aczél stated: "No honest person will feel satisfied if he does not do his best with perseverance and dedication to make the sunshine of peace shine again on Korea." The Hungarian Democratic Women's League sent a telegram to the Korean Democratic Women's League congratulating them on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    Albania
    In Albania, "Zëri i Popullit" wrote that the Albanian people welcomed the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with great satisfaction, considering it a most important event, a victory for the forces of peace, and conducive to the easing of international tensions. The Albanian people warmly congratulated the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers on their victory in signing the armistice agreement. In Tirana, the capital of Albania, workers at the Enver Hoxha Machine Factory held a meeting on the 28th. Young worker Ozha Katraguyoni said: The Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers' three years of indomitable and victorious struggle against the imperialists proved that the people who fight for a just cause are invincible.
     Mongolia
    The Mongolian people greeted the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with great satisfaction. The Mongolian newspaper "Ünen" wrote: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the cessation of the flames of war in Korea primarily mean that the forces of peace have gained a major victory over the forces of war. However, this should not make us relax our vigilance."
        The German People and Berlin Democratic Newspapers
    The German people greeted the news of the Korean armistice with hope and relief.
    Rolf Lansa, Deputy Director of the Leipzig Trade Fair, said: "The world peace movement has won another new victory. This shows that when good will prevails, international tensions can be eliminated through consultation, and the voice of the people can drown out the clamor of war. In our Germany, Germans in the east and the west urgently need to sit down at a table and hold an all-German conference in order to unify our country."
    Hosinger, Vice Chairman of the Erfurt District Council, said: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the forces of peace, especially a victory for the Soviet Union's strong peace initiatives. We salute the brave sons and daughters of the Korean people who have won this great victory with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers."
    On the 28th, Berlin's democratic newspapers all published the communique of the Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations announcing the signing of the armistice agreement in the most prominent positions, as well as the ceasefire orders issued by Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai. They also published commentaries, believing that the realization of the Korean armistice was a great victory for peace and consultation over war and provocation.
    The "Neues Deutschland" wrote in an editorial on the 28th entitled "A Great Victory for the Forces of Peace": "The forces of peace have achieved a great victory. Now they will work to ensure that no one dares to disrupt the armistice again." The editorial said: "The realization of the Korean armistice is a crushing defeat for the American warmongers: First, despite their enormous expenditure of manpower and material resources, they still cannot defeat the heroic Korean people and their Chinese brothers. The course of the Korean War is a warning to all aggressors, and it tells the world that people who fight resolutely for a just cause will never be defeated. Second, the United States has been exposed as an aggressor and an enemy of peaceful consultation, and has therefore become completely isolated. During the Korean War and the Panmunjom negotiations, more and more people in various countries were won over by us, and they joined us in advocating a peaceful resolution of international tensions." The newspaper concluded by saying: The results of the Panmunjom armistice negotiations show all the German people that understanding can be reached through consultation, all differences and disputes can be overcome, and we can have a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany - this method is realistic."
        The "Daily Review" editorial said: "The Korean armistice is not only a victory for the consistent desire of the forces of peace to seek understanding, but also encourages peace-loving people in all countries to resist imperialists and protect their own interests. The events in Korea encourage the increasingly broad masses of the German people to fight even more closely for unification, independence, democracy, and peace. At the same time, the victory won by the Korean people in such difficult circumstances of the United States's frenzied aggression will strengthen the confidence of the German patriotic people in victory."
        "Berliner Zeitung" paid tribute to the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers in its editorial. The editorial said: "The great and invincible morale of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the pressure of world public opinion, and the low morale of the American soldiers and their lackeys - these were the decisive factors that forced the United States to let go."
    The "Junge Welt," the organ of the Free German Youth League, pointed out: Although the barbaric American aggressors dropped countless bombs on Korea, "the Korean people are more powerful than bombs and terror. The support of peace-loving people, especially the support of the Chinese people, is more powerful than bombs and terror."
    New York "Daily Worker"
    The New York "Daily Worker" commented on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on the 27th: "Although the propaganda of the anti-peace groups continues to attempt to belittle the significance of the armistice, the world's peace forces hail the current armistice as a great victory for the people everywhere against the Washington bosses and their stooge Syngman Rhee, who attempted to launch a war in all of Asia through the 1950-53 Korean War."
    The newspaper said: "The armistice ends the most heinous war of modern times. This war has brought huge profits to large Wall Street corporations, which profit the most from the billions of dollars spent on armaments. The war has brought unnecessary casualties to the American people, which is the painful price paid by the American people. In the past few weeks alone, since Syngman Rhee sabotaged what appeared to be the final armistice agreement last month, several thousand more people have been killed or wounded."
    The newspaper condemned the obstruction and provocative actions of the US military and its puppet Syngman Rhee during the armistice negotiations over the past two years. The newspaper pointed out: "Syngman Rhee's threats to sabotage the armistice make it clear that he has powerful behind-the-scenes bosses in Washington who do not want peace under any circumstances. McCarthy arrogantly encouraged Syngman Rhee to continue his criminal activities against the armistice."
    Indian and Pakistani Newspapers
    Major Indian newspapers all published the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on the front page under banner headlines, and published the full text of the agreement. Major newspapers all published editorials on this matter. The Indian "Free Press," "New Age," and Pakistan's "Pakistan Times" pointed out in their editorials that this was a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people in resisting aggression and defending peace.
    The "Free Press" wrote in its editorial on the 29th: "The end of the war, which was conducted for three years and thirty-three days under the direct and indirect instigation and command of the American warmongers, will make all honest peace-loving people in the world happy, especially the people of Asia, colonial and dependent countries." The editorial said: "This is a victory for the peace policies of the people of all countries and the Chinese and Korean governments. It proves once again that there is no and cannot be any dispute or problem that cannot be resolved through consultation. Therefore, world public opinion must express its need for a great power conference including the Soviet Union with increasing determination, in order to ease world tensions." The editorial also said: "Even after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, there will still be many conspiracies to sabotage the armistice agreement. The old stooge of the American warmongers, Syngman Rhee's group, openly advocates sabotaging the armistice. Needless to say, the responsibility for Syngman Rhee's various crimes of sabotaging the armistice agreement should be borne entirely by the American rulers."
        The "Pakistan Times" said in its editorial on the 28th: The Korean armistice is first and foremost a great victory for the heroic Korean people, who, with the selfless assistance of the Chinese people, shattered Washington's vicious plan to place the entire Korean under Syngman Rhee's fascist dictatorship. The fact that they successfully resisted the combined aggression of several of the largest imperialist countries in the West is of great significance militarily, politically and morally. The editorial pointed out: The reluctance expressed by the most powerful people within the American ruling circles and their Korean puppets in accepting the armistice is further proof that they were responsible for the long Korean war of bloodshed.
    Citizens of Delhi, India
    The people of Delhi warmly welcomed the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    The Delhi Subzi Mandi District Peace Committee organized a torchlight procession on the evening of July 28. The 450 Delhi workers and citizens who participated in the procession carried torches and marched while shouting slogans with placards with slogans such as "Peace in Korea is a victory for the people!" "Imperialists must withdraw from Asia!" "Consultation is the road to peace!"
    Along the streets the procession passed, many men, women, old and young, shouted slogans along with the marchers. People standing on the roofs cheered the marchers, and passengers on passing streetcars joined the marchers in spreading the news that the Korean armistice had been achieved.
    After the parade, a rally was held outside the Birla Factory. Approximately 700 people attended the rally. B.D. Joshi, a member of the Delhi State Legislative Assembly and chairman of the Delhi Labor Association, Khaduta Sharma, assistant editor of the "New India Times," and Ram Chandra Sharma, general secretary of the Textile Workers' Union, all spoke at the meeting, welcoming the Korean armistice, calling for peaceful resolution of all international disputes, and demanding the holding of a great power conference.
    British Mass Organizations and People from All Walks of Life
    The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 28th: British mass organizations and people from all walks of life welcomed the Korean armistice, considering it an indicator of a comprehensive easing of world tensions.
    The British Peace Committee said: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement proves that it is possible to resolve disputes through consultation. The British Peace Committee called on public opinion to urge the government to propose a date and venue for a meeting of heads of state of great powers as soon as possible without any preconditions.
    The Britain-China Friendship Association said: "This event proves that all issues concerning the Far East can be effectively resolved through consultation. Peace in the Far East can bring great benefits to Britain."
    The National Women's Assembly said: "It must now be ensured that all the terms of the armistice agreement are implemented without delay and that all British troops are withdrawn quickly."
    World-renowned nutritionist Boyd Orr said: "I am very happy because the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, and I hope this armistice will lead to world peace."
    Putrill, the vicar of the Essex Tackted Parish, said: "We feel that this armistice is a big step towards world peace. Everything is fine, and tonight we will ring the bells of thanksgiving with our bells. We feel that people should now redouble their efforts to strive for peace."
        The "Daily Worker's" parliamentary correspondent wrote that most members of the House of Commons hoped that the Korean armistice might be a turning point in promoting the improvement of the situation in the Far East and world peace. Labour backbenchers called for immediate action to improve relations with China.
    Labour MP Joseph Reeves said: "The British public hopes that the armistice concluded in Korea is the beginning of a broader movement towards world understanding." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

        德国人民和柏林民主报纸
    德国人民以满怀希望和欣慰的心情迎接朝鲜停战的消息。
    来比锡博览会副主任罗尔夫·兰萨说：“世界和平运动又获得了一个新的胜利。这说明当善良的意志占优势时，国际紧张局势是能够用协商的办法来消除的，人民的声音是可以盖过战争叫嚣的。在我们德国，东部和西部的德国人迫切地需要在一张桌子前坐下来举行全德会议，以便统一我们的国家。”

    二十八日的“新德意志报”在题为“和平力量的巨大胜利”的社论中写道：“和平的力量取得了一个伟大的胜利。现在他们将努力使没有人敢重新破坏停战”。社论说：“朝鲜停战实现对美国战争贩子是一个惨败：第一，尽管他们耗费了巨大的人力和物力，还是不能战胜英勇的朝鲜人民和他们的中国兄弟。朝鲜战争的过程，是对所有侵略者的警告，它向全世界说明，为正义事业而坚决地战斗的人民是永远不会被战胜的。第二，美国被揭发为侵略者与和平协商的敌人，因而完全陷于孤立。在朝鲜战争期间和板门店谈判期间，在各国有愈来愈多的人被我们争取过来，和我们一起主张和平解决国际紧张局势。”该报最后说：板门店停战谈判结果向全德国人民说明：通过协商达到了解、使所有分歧和争执能够克服、使我们能得到统一、民主与爱好和平的德国——这种方法是现实的。”
        “每日评论”的社论说：“朝鲜停战不仅是和平力量争取了解的一贯愿望的胜利，同时它也鼓舞了各国爱好和平的人民抵抗帝国主义者，保护他们自己的利益。朝鲜的事情鼓舞着日益广泛的德国人民，使他们更加紧为争取统一、独立、民主与和平而斗争，同时，朝鲜人民在美国疯狂侵略的、这样艰苦的环境下所获得的胜利，将加强德国爱国人民对胜利的信心。”
        “柏林日报”在社论中向朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军致敬。社论说：“朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军伟大的不可战胜的士气、世界舆论的压力以及美国士兵和仆从们的士气低落——这都是使得美国不得不撒手的决定性的因素。”
    自由德国青年联盟机关报“青年世界”指出：虽然野蛮的美国侵略者在朝鲜投了无数炸弹，“但是朝鲜人民比炸弹和恐怖更有力量。爱好和平人民的支援，特别是中国人民的支援比炸弹和恐怖更有力量。”
    纽约“工人日报”
    纽约“工人日报”二十七日就朝鲜停战协定签字评论说：“尽管反和平集团的宣传继续企图贬低停战的意义，世界和平力量却欢呼目前的停战，认为这是世界各地反对华盛顿的头子和他们的走狗李承晚的人民的巨大胜利。华盛顿的头子和他们的走狗李承晚曾经企图通过一九五零—五三年的朝鲜战争，发动全亚洲的战争。”
    该报说：“停战结束了现代最令人憎恶的战争。这个战争给华尔街的大公司带来了巨额利润。它们从花在军备方面的亿万美元上得利最多。战争给美国人民带来了不必要的伤亡，这就是美国人民付出的痛苦的代价。在李承晚在上月份破坏了看来最后将达成的停战以后，仅在过去几个星期中，又有好几千人伤亡。”
    该报谴责美国军方及其傀儡李承晚在过去两年的停战谈判中的阻挠和挑衅行动。该报指出：“从李承晚扬言要破坏停战的举动中，可以清楚地看出，他在华盛顿有着在任何情况下都不要和平的有力的后台老板。麦卡锡狂妄地鼓励李承晚继续进行他反对停战的罪恶活动。”
    印度和巴基斯坦报纸
    印度各大报都在第一版上以通栏标题刊载了朝鲜停战协定签字的消息，并且刊载了这个协定的全文。各大报都就此事发表了社论。印度“自由报”、“新世纪报”和巴基斯坦的“巴基斯坦时报”在社论中指出这是朝中人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的巨大胜利。
    “自由报”二十九日的社论写道：“在美国战争贩子的直接和间接煽动和指挥下进行了三年零三十三天的战争的终止，将使世界上所有正直的爱好和平的人们感到高兴，特别高兴的是亚洲、殖民地和附属国家的人民。”社论说：“这是各国人民和中朝政府的和平政策的胜利，它又一次证明没有而且也不可能有任何争执或问题是不能够通过协商方式来解决的。因此，世界舆论必须越来越坚决地表示需要举行包括苏联在内的大国会议，以缓和世界紧张局势。”社论还说：“甚至在朝鲜停战协定签订后，仍然会有不少破坏停战协定的阴谋。美国战争贩子的老走狗李承晚的集团公然主张破坏停战。不用说，李承晚破坏停战协定的各种罪行的责任完全应由美国统治者来负。”
        “巴基斯坦时报”在二十八日的社论中说：朝鲜停战首先是英雄的朝鲜人民的巨大胜利，他们在中国人民的无私的援助下，击破了华盛顿把整个朝鲜置于李承晚法西斯独裁制度下的恶毒计划。他们成功地抵抗了西方几个最大帝国主义国家的联合侵略，这一事实不论在军事上、政治上和道义上都具有重大的意义。社论指出：美国统治集团中最有势力的一部分人士和他们的朝鲜傀儡在接受停战时明白表示的不情愿的态度又一次证明他们应对长期的朝鲜流血战争负责。
    印度德里市民
    德里人民热烈欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签字。

    英国群众团体和各界人民
    伦敦“工人日报”二十八日报道：英国的群众团体和各界人民欢迎朝鲜停战，认为它是全面缓和世界紧张局势的指标。
