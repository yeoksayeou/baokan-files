Joint Notice from the Central Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor to Strengthen Factory and Mine Sanitation Work in the Summer and Autumn Seasons

    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Health and Ministry of Labor issued a joint notice on July 4th to local health and labor departments regarding strengthening factory and mine sanitation work in the summer and autumn seasons. The full text is as follows:

    During the summer and autumn seasons, factories and mines are prone to diseases such as malaria, dysentery, typhoid fever, epidemic encephalitis B, and heatstroke, especially gastroenteritis. To ensure the completion of economic construction plans and the health of employees, local factories and mines are required to earnestly do the following:

    (1) Strengthen the management of food hygiene, and strictly prohibit the purchase of rotten and unclean food items. Health workers should assist food management personnel in inspecting the sanitation of canteens, kitchens, and drinking water, and establish various regular hygiene inspection systems based on specific circumstances.

    (2) Thoroughly carry out sanitation work in production sites and living environments, and establish a regular cleaning responsibility system. Pay special attention to eliminating flies and mosquitoes, thoroughly inspect sewers and ditches, fill in depressions, to prevent sewage accumulation, and pay attention to the cleaning of garbage and toilets.

    (3) The water sources of basic construction sites and highway projects should be strictly managed. In areas lacking water sources and without tap water, drinking water must be separated from other water. Untested raw water must be tested or disinfected before drinking.

    (4) Establish a strict reporting system for infectious diseases and food poisoning. If cases of infectious diseases or food poisoning are discovered, the factory or mine administration or capitalists should be immediately notified, and the local health administrative authority should also be notified for early treatment and isolation. Disinfection and treatment of the source of the epidemic must be emphasized.

    (5) High-temperature workshops (such as forging, steaming, etc.) and underground operations should improve ventilation. Existing ventilation equipment should be used to its fullest extent. Those without ventilation equipment must make every effort to improve it within permissible conditions, such as building sunshades, spraying water on roofs, and installing exhaust fans. Mechanical ventilation equipment that has already been included in the work plan should be installed as soon as possible. In addition, employees should be provided with sufficient special beverages (salt, licorice, mung bean boiled water, etc.).

    (6) Change the work method of neglecting prevention and emphasizing treatment. Health workers should regularly go deep among the masses to understand the working and living conditions of workers, grasp morbidity figures, analyze the causes of diseases, actively study prevention methods, and be responsible for conducting summer and autumn hygiene education for employees and their families so that employees universally pay attention to hygiene. In order to make hygiene education work regular, a regular hygiene education system should be established.

    It is hoped that local health administrative organs and labor administrative organs will cooperate with relevant departments to assist factories and mines in doing this work well.

    中央卫生部和劳动部联合通知各地加强厂矿夏秋季节卫生工作
    中央人民政府卫生部和劳动部于七月四日向各地卫生、劳动部门发出了关于加强厂矿夏秋季节卫生工作的联合通知，全文如下：
    夏秋季节，厂矿中容易发生疟疾、赤痢、伤寒、流行性乙型脑炎、热射病，特别是肠胃炎等疾病，为了保证经济建设计划的完成和职工身体的健康，要求各地厂矿切实做好以下工作：
    （一）加强饮食卫生的管理，严禁采购腐烂和不清洁的饮食物品。卫生工作人员要协助伙食管理人员进行食堂、厨房、饮水卫生情况的检查，根据具体情况，建立各种定期的卫生检查制度。
    （二）彻底做好生产场所、生活环境卫生工作，建立经常的清扫责任制度。特别注意灭蝇、灭蚊，彻底检查下水道和水沟，填垫坑洼，以防污水淤积，并注意垃圾和厕所的清理。
    （三）基本建设工地、公路工程的水源，应严加管理。在水源缺乏没有自来水地区，须把饮食用水和其他水分开，未经化验的生水，必须经过化验或消毒，才能饮用。
    （四）建立严格的传染病及食物中毒的报告制度。发现患传染病、食物中毒者，应立即报告本厂矿行政或资方，同时向当地卫生行政主管机关报告，以便进行早期治疗、隔离；并须重视疫源的消毒和处理。
    （五）高温车间（如熔锻、蒸煮等）和井下作业，应改善通风情况。现有通风设备，应尽量发挥其效用；没有通风设备者，须根据许可条件，尽力改善，如搭凉棚、屋顶喷水、加装排气风扇等；已列入作业计划的机械通风设备，应尽速安装；此外，并应供给职工足够的特殊饮料（食盐、甘草、绿豆开水等）。
    （六）改变不重视预防偏重治疗的工作方法。卫生工作人员，应经常深入群众，了解工人劳动和生活情况，掌握发病数字，分析疾病原因，主动研究预防的办法，并负责向职工及其家属进行夏秋季卫生教育，使职工普遍重视卫生。为了使卫生教育工作能经常化，应订立定期的卫生教育制度。
    希各地卫生行政机关和劳动行政机关，配合有关部门，协助厂矿作好这一工作。
