Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: After eight days of meetings, the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League victoriously concluded on the afternoon of July 2nd. From today onwards, the outstanding young generation of the motherland from all over the country will rush to various fronts, making heroic advances in building our great motherland.

This congress was a meeting for the motherland to review the strength of its youth, and it was also a mobilization meeting for all Youth League members as the country enters a period of planned construction. At the congress, the outstanding young generation of the motherland, with the courage and enthusiasm unique to young people, responded to the motherland's call to advance towards industrialization. They said that under the glorious and victorious banner of Mao Zedong, we are prepared to overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and, together with the broad masses of young people, complete all the tasks entrusted to us by the motherland.

At this congress, the delegates listened to, discussed, and adopted the work report given by Hu Yaobang, "Unite the Youth of the Whole Country and Advance Courageously in the Great Ranks of Building the Motherland." This report summarized the work experience of the Youth League over the past four years and stipulated the work principles and tasks of the Youth League during the period when the country entered a period of planned economic construction. The delegates listened to the report given by Comrade Li Chang on the revision of the Constitution of the China New Democratic Youth League, discussed and adopted the new Constitution, which will further consolidate the organization of the Youth League and improve its work. The delegates elected 143 people as members of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and 56 people as alternate members of the Central Committee, forming the Second Central Committee of the Youth League, strengthening the leadership of the Youth League.

This congress also fully demonstrated the friendship and unity of Chinese youth and youth from all countries. During the meeting, representatives from the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League and youth representatives from North Korea, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Mongolia, India, Japan, Indonesia, France, Italy, Britain, and Australia extended congratulations to the congress. At the same time, the congress also received congratulatory telegrams from youth organizations in many countries. All these warm congratulations greatly encouraged Chinese youth and expressed the common desire of Chinese youth and youth from all countries to strive for lasting world peace and a better future for youth.

Today, the delegates' mood is excited and agitated, and they are reluctantly saying goodbye to their comrades-in-arms. The crowds in the backyard lawns of Huairen Hall and under the lush grape trellises have increased compared to usual. Some are enthusiastically talking, some are shaking hands tightly, some are exchanging souvenirs, some are still taking group photos, and some are staring intently at the solemn, magnificent, and splendid Huairen Hall for the last time. Many delegates repeated Chairman Mao's words of wishing the youth good health, good studies, and good work, encouraging each other.

The congress unanimously adopted, amidst warm applause, the resolution on Comrade Hu Yaobang's work report on "Uniting the Youth of the Whole Country and Advancing Courageously in the Great Ranks of Building the Motherland," and the resolution on strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship, learning from the Soviet Union, and participating in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as a group member.

When the congress passed the telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, the entire audience stood up and cheered thunderously. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the mentor of youth, Chairman Mao!" resounded throughout the hall.

Biren Paluk, representative of the All-India Students' Federation and Secretary-General of the Calcutta University Student Union, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress and presented valuable gifts to the congress.

At 6:30 PM, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De arrived at the venue, at which time the entire audience stood up and cheered thunderously, with storm-like applause lasting for a long time. The delegates were deeply moved by the care and love given to them by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Before the meeting, the Party Central Committee continuously guided and helped the congress to prepare; on the eve of the meeting, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee gave extremely important instructions on the work of the Youth League; at the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Liu Shaoqi gave valuable instructions to the congress on behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, followed by important reports to the congress by Comrades Li Fuchun, Deng Zihui, and Qian Junrui. Today, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De arrived at the congress and gave important instructions to the congress, especially on June 30, when Chairman Mao personally received the presidium of the congress and gave extremely important instructions to the congress, encouraging the youth to be healthy, study well, and work well. These instructions and reports greatly helped the delegates to further clarify their understanding of the current situation and their tasks. The delegates unanimously assured the Party and Chairman Mao that they would take the Party's instructions as their direction forward, so that the organization of the Youth League could fully play the role of the Party's close assistant and reliable reserve force.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu De addressed the congress amidst warm applause. He said, "Your congress has been very fruitful. After the discussions at this congress, you have reached a unanimous understanding of the work principles and tasks of the Youth League. I believe that this congress will greatly promote the work of the Youth League in the future and will enable the Youth League to better fulfill its glorious task as the Party's assistant and reserve force in the future national construction period."

He continued, "The expectation that our great motherland places on the youth is to hope that the youth will train themselves to become active and conscious defenders and builders of the motherland. This requires you, the China New Democratic Youth League, to undertake, under the leadership of the Party, one of the fundamental undertakings of our Party – the task of cultivating youth. I believe you will certainly not fail the motherland's expectations of you."

Then, the delegates – the young and outstanding generation cultivated by the Party – presented flowers to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De to express their gratitude.

Next, all the foreign guests attending the congress, at the invitation of the presidium, stepped onto the rostrum amidst warm applause. Young Pioneers from Beijing presented flowers to them. The military music of "People of the World are of One Heart" sounded, and the audience shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the great unity of the youth of the world!"

Kang Nai'er, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported that the congress had received a total of 599 congratulatory telegrams and letters, as well as many gifts.

Finally, Liao Chengzhi delivered the closing speech. He said, "Our task in the future is to implement the valuable instructions given to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and to implement the resolutions and spirit of the congress into the actual actions of all Youth League members and youth. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the China New Democratic Youth League will certainly be able to unite the youth of the whole country, engage in creative labor, persevere in learning, closely connect with the masses, and complete the glorious tasks submitted to us by the Party and Chairman Mao in the great cause of defending and building the motherland."

The solemn military music of "The Internationale" sounded, and the entire audience stood in solemn silence. Thus, the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League victoriously concluded.

In the evening, the China New Democratic Youth League held separate banquets to entertain all the delegates and foreign guests.
