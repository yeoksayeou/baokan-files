Comrades at the No. 3 Plant told of the following incident: Once, a lathe operator in the machining workshop suddenly produced a lot of scrap. This worker's skills were no lower than other lathe operators, and the lathe he used was no worse than others, so why did he suddenly produce so much scrap? Everyone was very puzzled. After investigation, it became clear. It turned out that: the worker's wife was sick, and the treatment cost a lot of money; he planned to work harder and earn more wages to make up for the deficit. Anxious for quick results, he did a sloppy job. Because this lathe operator produced too much scrap, the planing operator below experienced downtime waiting for materials, which affected many processes such as milling, drilling, and grinding.

Similar "accidental" phenomena are common in the workshop. Today, this worker has something going on at home, or is sick himself, and needs to take a few days off; tomorrow, that worker is in a bad mood due to salary issues or other unsatisfactory things, and his work is not as energetic as usual. The production of a factory is organized by so many links, and every day, several links may experience some problems, big or small, for various reasons.

The workers have high labor enthusiasm, and they are constantly finding tricks and proposing rationalization suggestions. Today, this person improves the operation method, and tomorrow, that person improves the tools... A planing operator finds a trick and works faster, but the lathe operator still maintains the original pace. As a result, the person who found the trick ends up with nothing to do, wasting labor and equipment capacity.

The plan is fixed, but the production situation is alive and developing and changing every moment. These changes are difficult to predict one by one when formulating the plan. The plan itself often has inaccurate aspects that need to be corrected during execution. Any change in any link will affect the implementation of the plan. Therefore, having a plan does not mean that plan management has been achieved. To ensure the plan's implementation, there must also be a sound scheduling mechanism to solve these problems.

× × ×

At the No. 3 Plant, two types of scheduling meetings are held every day. One is the scheduling meeting held by each workshop, and the other is the plant-wide production scheduling meeting held by the production section. Through these two types of scheduling meetings and daily scheduling work, necessary adjustments are made to the disconnections in the execution of the plan, constantly seeking balance from imbalance, and using the method of changing partial plans to ensure the realization of the entire plan.

From 10:30 to 11:30 every morning, each workshop holds a scheduling meeting to check the progress of the previous day's plan, analyze the reasons for not completing the progress, and propose solutions. At the scheduling meeting, the factory and workshop schedulers must correctly analyze the reasons for the uncoordinated phenomena in the workshop. If it is found that the failure to complete the task is due to the worker's insufficient subjective effort, they should be helped and urged; if it is due to objective reasons, such as the plan is not accurate, the worker's technical ability has not yet reached this requirement, or a temporary accident has occurred, or it is affected by other links, then the task, equipment, and labor force should be appropriately adjusted. If a worker's efficiency has improved and exceeded the originally stipulated progress, new tasks must be assigned in a timely manner. Some problems cannot be solved within a workshop, for example, the progress of the previous workshop is slow, and the supply of raw materials and tools cannot keep up, affecting the workshop's progress; or, because one's own scrap production is too high, the supply and marketing section needs to supply more materials than the quota, and one's own plan is adjusted, requiring the relevant workshops and sections to revise their plans accordingly. These issues are submitted by the scheduler to the scheduling meeting held by the production section for resolution.

At the scheduling meeting held by the production section from 12:30 to 1:30 every day, the production section not only checks whether the lathe production completes the daily progress and whether the parts that should be put into storage are put into storage on time, but also mainly solves the problems that need to be solved in the parts production process but cannot be solved within each workshop. The production section can resolve the adjustment of tasks between workshops. If the indicators of each workshop need to be changed, or the tasks of relevant departments need to be changed (such as requiring more material to be supplied or supplied in advance), it needs to be approved by the factory director. For those units that fail to complete the task effectively, whether it is a section or workshop, the production section has the right to conduct inspections and supervision.

× × ×

In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, the scheduling workers must fight against all phenomena that hinder the implementation of the plan in the entire factory, supervise and inspect the implementation of the plan in all links of the factory, analyze all the reasons for the failure to complete the plan, and propose solutions. This task is extremely heavy. To do it well, the following issues need to be resolved:

First, there must be a relatively accurate operation plan. Before organizing rhythmic production, the No. 3 Plant actually had no operation plan, and the workshop had no daily progress plan, so the scheduler could not check the plan's execution and ensure the plan's implementation. When the operation plan deviates from reality, the scheduling work cannot guarantee its implementation. This was the case in the third workshop in the first quarter of this year. Due to various subjective and objective reasons, the parts reserve situation was very unbalanced at that time. The production section and the workshop did not grasp this situation enough when compiling the operation plan, and the assembly workshop constantly temporarily requested the third workshop to rush the required parts. The processing workshop had to meet the needs of the assembly workshop, and the scheduler had no way to ensure the implementation of the operation plan through scheduling. In addition, the workshop's capacity was weak at that time, and the third workshop failed to complete the plan for several months in a row.

Second, to do a good job in scheduling, it is necessary to educate employees on the overall concept of obeying scheduling. In order to ensure the completion of the plan, schedulers often have to change the tasks of some units or workers, or adjust equipment, labor, raw materials, etc. In making these adjustments, the following resistance is often encountered: the workers are doing the work they are already proficient in, and the scheduler suddenly adds a new task. The new work is not skilled, or the original task has loose quotas, and the new task has tight quotas, affecting wage income; sometimes a worker is originally supposed to be on the day shift, and the scheduler suddenly wants to transfer him to the night shift, and the worker is unwilling to obey the transfer. Some people emphasize that they have charts and work according to the charts, and are unwilling to accept new tasks; some people reluctantly accept them, but they are not very energetic when they work. Schedulers often have to assign these tasks to party members or members of the Communist Youth League. The production section often encounters departmentalism obstacles when it needs to change the tasks of other sections. In order to overcome these obstacles, on the one hand, leading cadres must strongly support the opinions of the scheduling system, and on the other hand, more importantly, they must educate employees on the overall concept.

Third, to do a good job in scheduling, the scheduler also needs to be familiar with all aspects of production and treat work with a high degree of responsibility. Otherwise, the progress cannot be accurately grasped, and the reasons for the failure to complete the task cannot be correctly analyzed. In this way, not only can the implementation of the plan not be guaranteed, but it often affects the compilation of the plan. The schedulers of the workshop sections in the third workshop were several apprentices. They were neither familiar with the business nor at ease with their work. They sat with the section chief every day, crossed out the progress on the work ticket, and refused to go deep into the site to understand the flow of parts. The process progress they mastered was often inaccurate. They often did not discover the problem until the end when the task was not completed, affecting the next process. Because the process progress could not be grasped, the numbers of work-in-progress and finished parts they provided to the planners every month were often inaccurate. In January of this year, the scheduler submitted to the planning section that the workshop's output value for the month was actually 280 million yuan less than the actual completed number. After it was discovered, this "false report" had been reported level by level to the higher-level leading organs. Some schedulers in the No. 3 Plant have made wrong scheduling suggestions because they are not familiar with the production situation. Stopping production that should not have been stopped, or transferring labor that could not be transferred, resulted in new disconnections. This not only fails to guarantee the implementation of the plan, but also affects the masses' support and trust in the schedulers. For schedulers, the most difficult and most important thing is to correctly analyze the reasons for the failure to complete the plan. Last spring, the drilling process on the gear box in the second workshop always failed to complete the progress. The scheduler could not analyze the reason, and the problem dragged on for two or three months without being resolved, because this process could only be done on this one lathe. Finally, the deputy director of the workshop discovered the problem. It turned out that the working hour quota for this process was too low, and the workers did not dare to exceed the quota too much, fearing that this would increase the quota. The workshop cadres persuaded the workers to increase the quota when revising the quota, and this link quickly caught up with the progress. It is difficult for a scheduler to fully adapt to the requirements of the job in a short period of time. However, if the scheduler goes deep into the site and establishes close contact with the masses, the masses (including technicians, mechanics, section chiefs, etc.) will help him analyze the problem, which will greatly make up for his own lack of ability. In the past, there was a scheduler in the second workshop who was not particularly proficient in the business, but because he was good at following the mass line and discussing problems with the masses, his scheduling work was done relatively well.

    沈阳机械三厂的调度工作
    宋琤
    三厂的同志讲起这样一件事情：有一次，加工车间的一个车工忽然出了很多废品。这个工人的技术并不比其他车工低，用的车床也不比别人的坏，为什么忽然出了很多废品呢？大家都很奇怪。经过调查，才弄清楚了。原来是：这位工人的妻子生了病，治病用了不少钱；他打算加点劲，多干点活，多挣点工资，好弥补一下亏空。心急贪快，活便干得粗糙了。这位车工废品出多了，下面的刨工便发生了停工待料的现象，从而影响到铣工、钻工、磨工等很多工序。
    类似的“偶然”现象车间里是很多的。今天这个工人家里有了事，或者是自己生了病，要请上几天假；明天那个工人因为工资问题或者其他不如意的事情情绪不大好，干起活来不像平常那么带劲。一个工厂的生产是由这么许多环节组织的，每一天，都可能有几个环节因为这样那样的缘故发生一些大大小小的故障。
    工人们的劳动热情很高，他们不停地在找窍门提合理化建议。今天这个人改进了操作方法，明天那个人又改善了工具……。一个刨工找了窍门，干活干得快了，可是车工还是按原来的进度。于是找了窍门的人反而弄得没活干，浪费劳动力和设备能力。
    计划是死的，生产的情况是活的，每时每刻都在发展着变化着。这些变化，在编制计划时，很难一一预料得到。计划本身也经常有不准确的地方，需要在执行中进行修正。任何一个环节发生了变化，都会影响到计划的实现。因而，有了计划，并不等于已经实现了计划管理，要保证计划实现，还要有健全的调度机构来解决这些问题。
    ×    ×    ×
    在三厂，每天要开两种调度会议。一种是各车间召开的调度会议，一种是生产科召开的全厂的生产调度会议。通过这两种调度会议和日常调度工作，对于执行计划中的脱节现象进行必要的调整，不断地从不平衡中寻求平衡，用变动局部计划的办法来保证全部计划的实现。
    在每天上午十时半至十一时半，各车间分别召开的调度会议上要检查前一天计划进度完成的情况，分析完不成进度的原因，提出解决问题的办法。在调度会议上，工厂和车间的调度员必须对车间中产生不协调现象的原因进行正确分析。如果发现完不成任务是由于工人的主观努力不够，就要对他进行帮助和督促；如果属于客观原因，比如计划确定的不准确，工人的技术能力一时还达不到这个要求，或者是临时发生了意外情况、或者是受其他环节的影响，这时，便要对任务、设备、劳动力进行适当的调整。如果那个工人的效率提高了，超过了原来规定的进度，也必须及时派给新的任务。有些问题不是一个车间内部可以解决的，比如，上个车间的进度慢了，原材料、工具供应不上了，影响了车间的进度；或者是，因为自己的废品出多了，需要供销科超过指标多投料，自己的计划调整了，需要有关车间科股相应修正他们的计划等。这些问题，就由调度员提交生产科召开的调度会议解决。
    在生产科每天十二时半至一时半召开的调度会议上，生产科不但要检查车床生产是否按日完成进度，应该入库的零件是否按时入库，主要地还要解决零件生产过程中需要解决而又为各车间内部所解决不了的问题。各车间之间的任务的调整，生产科可以解决。如果各车间的指标需要变动，或者是变动有关科室的任务（比如要求多投料或提前供应），就需要经过厂长批准。对于那些完成任务不力的单位，不管是科室车间，生产科都有权进行检查督促。
        ×    ×    ×
    为了保证计划的实现，调度工作者要向全厂一切障碍计划实现的现象进行斗争，要对全厂各个环节执行计划的情况进行督促检查，分析一切完不成计划的原因，提出解决的办法。这个任务是极其繁重的。要做得好，需要解决以下的问题：
    首先，必须要有比较准确的作业计划。在组织有节奏生产前，三厂实际上没有作业计划，车间没有每天的进度计划，调度员也就无所谓检查计划执行情况和保证计划的实现。当作业计划脱离了现实时，调度工作也就无法保证它实现。今年第一季度中，三车间就是这种情况。由于各种主观、客观的原因，当时零件储备情况很不平衡。生产科和车间编制作业计划时对于这种情况掌握不够，装配车间便不断临时要求三车间突击所需要的零件。加工车间又必须满足装配车间的需要，调度人员便没有办法通过调度保证作业计划的实现。加上当时车间能力薄弱，三车间一连几个月没有完成计划。
    第二，要做好调度工作，必须对职工进行服从调度的整体观念的教育。为了保证计划的完成，调度人员经常要变动一些单位或工人的任务，或者进行设备、劳动力、原材料等的调整。在进行这些调整时会经常遇到下面这些抵抗：工人们正干着自己已经熟练了的活，调度人员突然给增加了一个新任务，新工作物干起来不熟练，或者是原来的活定额松，新任务定额紧，影响工资收入；有时候某一工人本来是该白天班的，调度人员突然要把他调到夜班，这时候工人就不乐意服从调动。有些人强调说有了图表，就按图表干活，不肯接受新任务；有些人虽然勉强接受了，但是干起来总是不大带劲。调度员常常只有把这些任务派给党员或团员。生产科有时需要变动其他科室的任务，也常遇到本位主义的障碍。为了克服这些障碍，一方面领导干部固然要对调度系统的意见予以大力支持，另一方面，更重要的还是要对职工进行整体观念的教育。
    第三，要做好调度工作，还需要调度人员熟悉有关生产的各方面的问题，并以高度的责任心对待工作。否则，就不能准确地掌握进度，就不能正确地分析完不成任务的原因。这样，不但无法保证计划的实现，而且常常影响计划的编制。三车间工段的调度员是几位徒工担任的，他们既不熟悉业务，又不安心工作，每天坐在工段长那里，靠工作票划划进度，不肯深入现场去了解零件的流动情况。他们所掌握的工序进度，经常是不准确的，他们常常要到最后完不成任务影响到下道工序时才发现问题。由于工序进度掌握不了，每月他们提供给计划员的在制品和零件成品数字经常不准确。今年一月，调度员提给计划科的车间当月产值竟然比实际完成数字少了二亿八千万元。等到发觉后，这个“假报告”已经逐级上报到上级领导机关去了。三厂有些调度员由于不熟悉生产情况，也曾提出过错误的调度意见。把不该停止的生产给停止了，或者把不能调动的劳动力给调动了，结果造成了新的脱节现象。这样不但不能保证计划实现，同时也会影响了群众对调度员的支持和信赖。对于调度人员来说，最困难而又最为重要的是正确的分析完不成计划的原因。去年春天，二车间牙轮箱在?床上钻孔这道工序总是完不成进度，调度员分析不出原因，问题一直拖了两三个月不得解决，因为这道工序只能在这一个?床上做。最后，还是车间副主任发现了问题，原来是这道工序的工时定额太低了，工人不敢超过定额太多，怕这样会提高定额。车间干部在修改定额时说服工人提高了定额，这个环节很快就赶上了进度。一个调度员，在短时期内，能够完全适应工作的要求是有困难的。但是，如果调度人员深入现场和群众取得密切联系，群众（包括技术人员、机械员、工段长等）就会帮助他分析问题，就会大大地弥补自己能力不够的缺陷。过去，二车间有个调度员，业务水平并不特别高，就是因为他善于走群众路线，有问题多和群众商量，他的调度工作就作得比较好。
