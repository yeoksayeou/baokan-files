    A Large Number of Saplings Destroyed in Afforestation Areas of Fengtan, Dangshan County
    Wu Jingyun and Jiang Mingzhao of the Forestry Bureau of Teng County, Shandong Province, wrote: Gaozhai District, Fanzhai District, Tangzhai District, and other places in Dangshan County, Jiangsu Province, along the old course of the Yellow River and both banks of the Dasha River, are sandy wasteland areas where afforestation has already been carried out in Fengtan. Since March of this year, many local people have been digging up grass roots here, severely damaging the planted seedlings in the afforestation areas. According to preliminary statistics, more than 40,000 seedlings of tamarisk and locust trees have been dug up (not counting wild seedlings), covering an area of more than 10,000 mu. After the Dangshan County Forestry Station discovered this situation, it reported it to the county government seven times in a row. The county government only sent one cadre to the area for a cursory inspection, but the problem has not been dealt with yet. Zhang Qingyu, the forestry committee member of Xiaowu Village, Gaozhai District, carried more than 400 seedlings he picked up along the road to the county to explain the situation of the seedlings being destroyed to the Construction Section and requested that measures be taken to stop it, but it did not attract the attention of the Construction Section.
    What is particularly serious is that, under the influence of the Dangshan County People's Government's neglect of forestry construction, many district and township cadres lack the necessary understanding of afforestation and forest protection work, and use a one-sided mass viewpoint to condone actions that destroy trees. For example, Cao Faqi, a civil affairs assistant in Gaozhai District, not only did not conduct forest protection education for the masses, but instead said to the masses: "The Forestry Station is bureaucratic, and forest protection work does not conform to the interests of the masses..."
    We believe that Dangshan County's neglect of forestry construction is wrong, and we suggest that the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government urge the county to check and correct the above situation.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    砀山县封滩造林地区大量树苗遭到破坏
    山东省滕县专区林业局武景云、蒋明昭来信：沿黄河故道及大沙河两岸的江苏省砀山县高寨区、范寨区、唐寨区等地，是已经封滩造林的沙荒地区。今年三月，当地不少群众在这里大刨草根，严重地破坏了造林地区所植的苗木。据初步统计，被刨掉的枰柳、洋槐等树苗在四万株以上（野生树苗尚不计算在内），面积达一万多亩。砀山县林业所发现这个情况后，向该县人民政府连续作了七次报告，县人民政府才派了一个干部到当地潦潦草草地检查了一次，但至今还没处理这个问题。该县高寨区小武庄村林业委员张庆语，带着沿路拾到的树苗四百多株到县里去，向建设科说明树苗被破坏的情况，请求设法制止，也未引起建设科的重视。
    特别严重的是：在该县人民政府忽视林业建设的思想影响下，不少区、乡干部对造林、护林工作缺乏应有的认识，用片面群众观点纵容破坏林木的行动。如高寨区民政助理员曹法启同志不但不向群众进行护林教育，反而向群众说：“林业所官僚主义，护林工作不合群众利益……。”
    我们认为：砀山县忽视林业建设是不对的，建议江苏省人民政府督促该县检查、纠正以上情况。
