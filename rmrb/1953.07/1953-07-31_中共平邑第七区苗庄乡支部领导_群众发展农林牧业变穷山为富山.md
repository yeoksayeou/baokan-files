CCP Pingyi Seventh District Miaozhuang Township Branch Leads Masses to Develop Farming, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry, Transforming Poor Mountains into Rich Mountains
The CCP Shandong Tengxian District Committee

The CCP Miaozhuang Township Branch in the Seventh District of Pingyi County, Shandong Province, based on the township's objective environment of being near mountains and water, mobilized the masses to close off mountains for afforestation in a way that suited local conditions. They developed animal husbandry, built mountain dams, and transformed terraced fields into paddy fields, comprehensively developing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. This provided a correct path for mountain farmers to change their impoverished lives and transform poor mountains into rich ones. Consequently, the township successively won the honorary titles of county-level model for closing off mountains for afforestation and model for mutual aid and cooperation in achieving bumper harvests.

Miaozhuang Township, Pingyi County, is located in the Tianbao Mountain valley, mostly consisting of mountainous and barren land. The township has over 3,300 mu of cultivated land, with terraced fields accounting for nearly 3,000 mu. This type of land is both drought-prone and often subject to severe flooding due to torrential rains during the rainy season, causing serious disasters. Therefore, the masses have always lived in extreme poverty. Before liberation, the township had 185 households, of which only 7 landlord households and 9 rich peasant households lived relatively well. 55 households frequently fled famine to beg for food, 46 households were tenants or hired laborers, and 40 poor peasant households subsisted on bran and vegetables for half the year. Only 28 households could be considered middle peasants. After liberation in 1940, although the lives of the masses improved somewhat through rent reduction and interest rate cuts and land reform, the looting and destruction by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in 1947 caused great losses to the masses, resulting in a serious disaster. For example, in the spring of 1948, the entire township had only 90 head of livestock, and farmland and fruit trees were laid waste. At that time, out of 263 households, 186 were without food. In Yangjia Village, where the disaster was most severe, 23 out of 24 households were without food.

Based on the above situation, the township party branch, in addition to actively leading the masses to overcome the serious disaster, in order to further develop production and completely change the township's historical poverty situation, earnestly studied and discussed the government's instructions on closing off mountains for afforestation and developing animal husbandry. Combining these instructions with the local specific conditions and the demands of the masses, they believed that focusing on closing off mountains for afforestation, developing fruit trees, and promoting animal husbandry, so that agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry combined to comprehensively develop production, was the key to improving the lives of the masses and transforming poor mountains into rich ones. Therefore, they first convened party and Youth League member meetings to mobilize and discuss, specifically analyzing the conditions and prospects for developing forestry and animal husbandry in the township. During the discussion, it was revealed that some party members and the masses still had many ideological concerns about closing off mountains for afforestation and developing animal husbandry. Generally, they believed that "good things are good, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." Some said, "Such a large mountain, where do we start? Where do we get the seedlings?" They felt that there were many difficulties and it would be difficult to solve them. Some believed that "If we close off the mountains, we are afraid that people from other villages who graze cattle and collect firewood will damage them." Some worried about not doing a good job, saying, "Everyone has their own affairs, and people's hearts are not aligned. It will be difficult to handle the benefits of closing off mountains for afforestation." Households with cattle and sheep were also afraid that they would have nowhere to graze their sheep and cattle after the mountains were closed off. After mobilization and specific analysis and discussion, the above ideological concerns were first resolved among party members, Youth League members, and activists. Then, with party members, Youth League members, and activists taking the lead in demonstrating, and with typical examples of people who had become wealthy through afforestation, the masses were patiently mobilized. A township afforestation committee was established, and cooperatives for closing off mountains for afforestation were formed at the village level, absorbing masses on a voluntary basis. Thus, the broad masses were united and mobilized, overcoming various difficulties and smoothly completing the preparatory work for closing off mountains for afforestation. After the establishment of township and village organizations for closing off mountains for afforestation, agreements were made with neighboring townships to demarcate mountain boundaries, and boundaries were also demarcated according to the size of each village in the township and the area it should be allocated. This prevented disputes caused by random mountain closures and afforestation. A forest protection covenant and a method of recording work points based on labor and distributing dividends based on work points were democratically discussed and formulated by the masses participating in afforestation. Forest farms and grasslands were rationally divided, pastures and grazing routes were reserved, and contact was established with the state-owned Tianbao Mountain Forest Farm, which helped solve the technical problems of seedlings and seedling cultivation. At the same time, according to the new production situation of closing off mountains for afforestation, the existing mutual aid teams were reorganized, new content for mutual aid production was added, and accounting of work and income began to be implemented within the teams, making the mutual aid organizations more active.

In this way, various ideological concerns among the masses were dispelled, and some specific problems were solved. As a result, the work of closing off mountains for afforestation in the township rapidly unfolded, forming a mass movement. In 1950, more than 50,000 trees were planted in the township. By 1952, this had reached more than 287,000 trees (including approximately 55,000 fruit trees), with more than 3,700 mu of mountains closed off and more than 20 mu of seedlings cultivated. This spring, another 54,700 trees were planted (including more than 7,000 fruit trees), and 6.5 mu of seedlings were cultivated, along with 3,700 honeysuckle mounds. Now, whenever it rains, many people go up the mountains to plant trees, not only mobilizing male laborers but also women. For example, in 1950, 126 women participated in the cooperative for closing off mountains for afforestation.

With the development of the movement to close off mountains for afforestation, the township also paid attention to the development of animal husbandry. In 1949, the township had 90 head of cattle and donkeys each, and less than 100 sheep. By 1952, the number of cattle had increased to 170, donkeys to 280, and sheep to 580. When closing off mountains for afforestation, pastures and grazing routes were specifically reserved, which not only solved the contradiction between grazing and animal husbandry but also encouraged the masses to increase livestock. This year, the township plans to increase livestock by 45 head and sheep by 119.

In order to combat drought and prevent seedlings from being washed away by mountain floods, the township has vigorously carried out the renovation of small dams and the construction of new dams in recent years, as well as the work of damming mountain gullies and digging wells, so that many terraced fields have been transformed into paddy fields. By the end of 1952, the township had dammed 16 mountain gullies and built 14 wells (diverting water to the fields, making half-wells), irrigating 103 mu of land. This spring, more than 8,400 zhang of new dams were built, and it is planned to dam 25 mountain gullies and dig 6 wells this year, striving to irrigate 452 mu of land. In addition, great achievements have also been made in increasing fertilizer application, promoting superior varieties, improving agricultural technology, and preventing pests and diseases. For example, technical research groups have been established in each village to promote superior varieties such as 438 wheat, 811 millet, Sizi cotton, and Shengli Baihao sweet potatoes. The old habit of not plowing in winter has been changed. When various insect pests occurred last year, they were promptly exterminated, resulting in a significant increase in agricultural output. The 3,357 mu of cultivated land in the township produced more than 69,000 jin more of grains and sweet potatoes in the autumn of 1952 than in the autumn of 1951 (an increase of 15%).

The township's ability to achieve the above remarkable achievements in production is mainly due to the township party branch's ability to utilize local specific conditions, adapt to the needs of the masses, find methods for developing production, and organize the masses to participate in mutual aid and cooperation on a voluntary basis to carry out collective production. After the township launched a mass movement to close off mountains for afforestation and increase livestock, the content of production became more complex. Various "tasks" often crowded together. For example, spring plowing, building mountain dams, and pruning fruit trees required a lot of labor. Summer harvesting, summer planting, and collecting honeysuckle and catching pear weevils (pests) crowded together. Autumn harvesting and autumn plowing had to be carried out at the same time as picking pears and cutting mountain grass. Therefore, if each household were to work alone, there would certainly be many difficulties. In the past, although there were some temporary habits of helping each other with work among the masses, they were not frequent and could not meet the needs of the current comprehensive development of production. Based on this situation, the township branch, with the forward development of production, promptly led the villages to consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations. By this spring, 240 households of farmers in the township had been organized, accounting for 91.2% of the total number of households. Only 23 individual farmers were not organized. The members of the mutual aid and cooperative teams also participated in the forestry cooperatives. They carried out production on the basis of mutual aid teams, achieving reasonable arrangements for various "tasks" and comprehensively developing production.

Due to the combination of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and the comprehensive development of production, the actual income of farmers in the township has greatly increased in recent years, and their lives have been significantly improved. In terms of income, in addition to agriculture, the township has earned a total of 240,000 jin of mountain grass in the past three years, which is equivalent to about 30,000 jin of grain. The pear trees that have already borne fruit yielded 190,000 jin of yellow pears in 1952 alone, which can be exchanged for about 190,000 jin of grain. The total income from the above two items can be exchanged for about 220,000 jin of grain. The entire township of 1,321 people has an average of about 170 jin of grain per person. If the income from honeysuckle, hawthorn, walnuts, and other fruit trees is added, the average is about 200 jin of grain per person. In terms of living, 61 households in the township had surplus grain in 1952, and 185 households had enough to eat and use. Only 17 households were still short of some grain due to special circumstances. For example, Li Chengyu's family of seven used to beg for food all year round, but now they have enough to eat and use, and have even taken in a daughter-in-law. Zhang Fengqi's family of five has eight mu of land and planted 50 fruit trees. In 1952, they harvested 500 jin of mountain fruit, 50 jin of honeysuckle, plus 2,500 jin of grain from agricultural production, for a total income of more than 3,950 jin of grain. They also harvested 7,000 jin of mountain grass. The whole family has enough to eat and surplus. Now they feed one head of cattle and one donkey each, and have built seven new houses in the past three years.

The masses in the township, due to the increase in actual income and the improvement of production, have deeply realized that it is possible and necessary to do a good job in agricultural production in mountainous areas while also doing a good job in forestry and animal husbandry. This is the best way to change the poor conditions in mountainous areas. If the township's plans for repairing terraced fields and developing forestry and animal husbandry are all realized in the future, the lives of the masses will be further improved. Therefore, in addition to repairing terraced fields and developing forestry and animal husbandry, they also pay attention to technical research. For example, most of the young and middle-aged people in the township have now learned how to scrape the bark of pear trees and catch pests. In short, the production enthusiasm of the masses in the township is rising day by day, and they are actively developing production in order to further change the basic situation of poverty in mountainous areas.

    中共平邑第七区苗庄乡支部领导  群众发展农林牧业变穷山为富山
    中共山东滕县地委会
    中共山东省平邑县第七区苗庄乡党支部，根据该乡靠山邻水的客观环境，因地制宜地发动群众封山造林；发展牧畜业，修筑山坝，改梯田为水田，全面发展了农林牧业生产，为山地农民找到了改变贫困生活变穷山为富山的正确道路。因而该乡曾先后获得了全县的封山造林模范和互助合作丰产模范的光荣称号。
    平邑县苗庄乡位于天宝山的山峪中，多是山岭薄地，全乡共有三千三百余亩耕地，梯田即占近三千亩，这种耕地既不耐旱，又常因雨季山洪暴发田苗被淹而造成严重灾荒，所以群众历来生活就极为贫苦。在解放前，全乡有一百八十五户人口，其中除七户地主、九户富农生活较好外，有五十五户经常逃荒要饭，当佃户或当雇工的有四十六户，糠、菜半年粮的贫农四十户，能够用的中农仅二十八户。一九四○年解放后，经过减租减息和土地改革群众生活虽然已有些改善，但是由于一九四七年蒋匪军的抢掠和破坏，使群众遭受很大损失，造成了严重的灾荒。如一九四八年春，全乡仅剩有大小牲口九十头，农田荒芜、果树被毁，当时在二百六十三户中，断粮的达一百八十六户，灾荒最严重的杨家庄，共有二十四户，其中断粮者即达二十三户。
    该乡党支部根据上述情况，除积极领导群众战胜了严重的灾荒以外，为了进一步地发展生产，彻底改变该乡历来的贫困局面，他们曾认真地学习和讨论了政府关于封山造林和发展畜牧业的指示，并结合当地具体情况和群众要求，认为有重点地封山造林，发展果树，提倡牧养家畜，使农林牧业相结合全面的发展生产，是改善群众生活，变穷山为富山的关键。因此，他们首先召开了党、团员会议，进行动员和讨论，具体分析了该乡发展林牧业的条件和前途。在讨论中，反映了某些党员和群众对封山造林，发展牧畜业还存在着许多思想顾虑，一般的认为“好事是好事，只是远水不解近渴”，有的说“这样大片的山，从什么地方下手呢？树苗子到那里去弄呢？”他们感到困难很多，不易解决；有的认为“咱封了山，怕外乡放牛的和拾柴的给破坏了”；有的担心怕办不好，如说：“众家众事，人多心不齐，封山造林的收益不好处理”；有牛羊的户，也怕封了山后无处放羊放牛。以上思想顾虑经过动员和具体的分析讨论，在党、团员和群众积极分子中首先得到了解决，然后以党、团员和群众积极分子带头示范，以原有造林发家的典型实例，耐心地向群众进行了宣传动员，并成立了乡封山造林委员会，以村为单位，吸收群众自愿参加封山造林合作社，因而就团结和发动了广大群众，克服了各种困难，顺利地完成了封山造林的准备工作。在成立乡、村封山造林的组织以后，接着就和邻乡协议划分了山界，按该乡各村大小和应摊地区也划开了界限，这样就可防止因乱封山，乱造林而引起纠纷；并由参加封山造林的群众民主讨论制订了护林公约和按劳记分、按工分红的办法，合理地划分了林场、草场，留出了牧场、牧道，又与公营天宝山林场建立了联系，由林场帮助解决了树苗与植树育苗的技术问题，同时根据封山造林的新的生产情况，整顿了已有的互助组，增加了互助生产的新内容，并开始在组内实行计工算账，使互助组织更加活跃起来。
    这样就既解除了群众中的各种思想顾虑，又解决了一些具体问题，因之，该乡封山造林工作迅速展开，形成了群众性的运动。一九五零年全乡种树五万余株，至一九五二年即达二十八万七千余株（其中各种果树约五万五千余株），封山三千七百余亩，育苗二十余亩；今年春季又植树五万四千七百余株
    （其中果树七千余株），育苗六亩半，并栽银花三千七百余墩。现在该乡每逢下雨以后，就有很多人上山栽树，不仅发动了男劳动力，而且还有妇女参加。如在一九五零年时，妇女参加封山造林合作社的即达一百二十六人。
    随着封山造林运动的开展，该乡同时注意了畜牧业的发展。一九四九年全乡牛、驴各有九十头，羊不足百只；至一九五二年，牛增至一百七十头，驴增至二百八十头，羊增到五百八十头，他们在封山造林时，专门留出了牧场、牧道，因而不仅解决了养草和畜牧的矛盾，而且鼓励了群众增添了牲畜，今年该乡还计划再增加牲口四十五头，羊一百一十九只。
    为了抗旱和防止禾苗被山洪冲毁，该乡几年来除大力进行整修小坝，建筑新坝外，并进行了闸山沟、打井等工作，使许多梯田变成了水田。到一九五二年底，该乡共闸山沟十六处，做井（把水引到地头上，作半边井）十四眼，可浇地一百零三亩，今年春季又修新坝八千四百余丈，计划今年再闸山沟二十五处，打井六眼，争取浇地四百五十二亩。此外，在增施肥料、推广优良品种、改进农业技术、防止病虫害方面，也获得了很大成绩。如各村都建立了技术研究小组，推广了四三八小麦、八一一谷子、斯字棉和胜利百号地瓜等良种；改变了群众不冬耕的旧习惯；去年发生了各种虫害时，均作到了及时捕灭，因而农业产量有很大提高。全乡三千三百五十七亩耕地，仅一九五二年秋季比一九五一年秋季即多增产谷物、地瓜等六万九千余斤（增产百分之十五）。
    该乡在生产上，所以能够获得以上的显著成绩，主要是由于该乡党的支部善于利用当地具体条件，适应群众要求找出发展生产的方法，并在群众自愿的基础上组织群众参加互助合作，集体进行生产的结果。该乡在发动群众性的封山育林和增加牧畜之后，生产内容更加复杂，往往各种“活路”挤在一起，如春耕和修筑山坝、修果木树等活，都须用很多劳力，夏收、夏种和采银花、捉梨狗子（害虫）挤在一起，秋收、秋耕又得和下梨、割山草等同时进行，因此如果一家一户地去单干，困难一定很多，过去群众间虽然有些临时互相帮工干活的习惯，但很不经常，还不能满足目前全面发展生产的需要。该乡支部根据这一情况，随着生产的向前发展，及时领导各村整顿与发展了互助合作组织，至今年春，全乡组织起来的农民已达二百四十户，占总户数的百分之九十一点二，未组织起来的单干农民仅有二十三户，互助合作组的组员还参加了林业合作社，他们以互助组的基础进行生产，作到了各种“活路”合理安排，全面发展了生产。
    由于农林牧畜业互相结合，全面地发展生产，几年来该乡农民的实际收入大大增加，生活上已有了显著的改善。在收入上除农业外，三年来全乡共收入山草二十四万斤，约换粮三万斤，已结果的梨树，仅一九五二年就收黄梨十九万斤，约可换粮十九万斤，以上两项收入合计约可换粮二十二万斤左右，全乡一千三百二十一人，平均每人合粮一百七十斤左右，如再加上银花、山楂、核桃等其他果树收入，每人平均约合粮二百斤左右。在生活上，一九五二年全乡有余粮者六十一户，够吃够用者一百八十五户，仅有十七户因特殊情况尚缺一部分粮食。如李成玉全家七口人，过去终年讨饭，现已有吃有用，并娶上了儿媳妇。张凤岐全家五口人，八亩地，栽果树五十棵，一九五二年收山果五百斤，银花五十斤，再加农业产粮二千五百斤，共计收入粮三千九百五十余斤，另收山草七千斤，全家有吃有余，现在喂牛、驴各一头，三年来新盖房子七间。
    该乡群众由于实际收入的增加，生产的改善，已深刻地认识到：在山区搞好农业生产，同时搞好林业和牧畜业是可能的，而且是应该的，这是改变山区贫困状况的最好方法。该乡如将来修整梯田和发展林、牧业的计划全部实现，群众生活将还会得到更大的提高。因此，他们除修整梯田，发展林、牧业外，还注意了技术上的研究，如全乡青壮年现在已大部学会了梨树刮皮和捉害虫的办法。总之，该乡群众生产情绪日益高涨，正在为进一步地改变山区贫困的基本情况而积极地发展生产。
