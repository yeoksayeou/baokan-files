    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th—Although Syngman Rhee clamors to go it alone, the South Korean people and the Rhee puppet soldiers are unwilling to sell their lives for this political gambler. According to a reporter from the American International News Service, quoting "a very qualified observer of Korean affairs" in South Korea, this is the sentiment of the South Korean people.
    This "observer" said that the South Korean people lack enthusiasm for Syngman Rhee's do-or-die fanaticism. This is primarily manifested in the widespread phenomenon of draft evasion among South Korean youth. He said that South Korean government officials admit that in a recent conscription, 73 percent of eligible young men did not register. Draft evasion is even more common in cities because it is easier there. Korean newspapers often denounce "rich men's sons" for evading military service. In Seoul, Koreans can "buy" exemption from military service for 25 to 100 US dollars. The South Korean government has ordered searches for draft evaders and deserters. This shows that the people lack enthusiasm for military adventures. In Busan, military police wearing black helmets ride around in trucks searching the streets for suspicious young men.
    He said: South Korean farmers are unwilling to pay more sacrifices for Syngman Rhee's ambitions. They are "well aware of the cost of unilateral action and feel that it is not worth it. I am quite sure that the vast majority of the Korean people feel the same way."
    The officers and soldiers of the Rhee puppet army are also unwilling to continue fighting. This "observer" quoted a senior officer of the Rhee puppet army in a recent conversation: "At least 80 percent of the Korean soldiers just want to go home." Some junior officers and soldiers simply say: "The best thing is not to fight anymore."
    Recently, when the Syngman Rhee gang launched a "march north" demonstration in Gwangju, puppet soldiers clashed with the demonstrators. Enraged soldiers shouted at the demonstrators: "My carbine is here. If you are so willing to march north, go yourselves, but don't ask us to go north to die."

### 南朝鲜人民反对继续进行战争

    南朝鲜人民反对继续进行战争
    【新华社开城五日电】虽然李承晚叫嚣着要单独干下去，但是南朝鲜人民和李伪军士兵们却都不愿意为了这个政治赌棍卖命。美国的国际新闻社的记者根据在南朝鲜的“一个非常有资格的朝鲜问题观察家”的话，报道了南朝鲜人民的这种情绪。
    这个“观察家”说，南朝鲜人民对李承晚的不成功毋宁死的狂热手段缺乏热情。这首先表现在南朝鲜青年中普遍存在着逃避兵役的现象。他说，南朝鲜政府官员承认，在今年的一次征兵中，合格的青年中有百分之七十三没有来登记。在城市中，逃避兵役的现象更是普遍，因为在那里比较容易些。朝鲜的报纸常常斥责“富家子弟”逃避兵役，在汉城，朝鲜人用二十五到一百美元就可以“买到”免除兵役。南朝鲜政府曾经下令搜捕逃避兵役的人和逃兵。这说明人民对军事冒险缺乏热情。在釜山，头戴黑色钢盔的宪兵乘着卡车在街道上来去地搜捕可疑的青年人。
    他说：南朝鲜农民都不愿意为了李承晚的野心而付出更多的牺牲。他们“深知单独行动的代价，并感到这是得不偿失的。我完全肯定，绝大多数朝鲜人民有同样的感觉。”
    李伪军的官兵们也不愿意继续打下去。这位“观察家”援引了李伪军一个高级军官在最近的谈话：“至少有百分之八十的朝鲜士兵只是想回家，”一些下级军官和士兵干脆说：“最好的事情是不要再打仗。”
    最近李承晚匪帮在光州发动“向北进军”的示威时，伪军士兵曾和示威者发生冲突。被激怒的士兵们对示威者喊道：“我的卡宾枪在这里，如果你们那么愿意向北进军，你们自己去好了，但是别叫我们到北方送死去。”
