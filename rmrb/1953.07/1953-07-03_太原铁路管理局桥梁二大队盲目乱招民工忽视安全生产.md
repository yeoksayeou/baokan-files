    Taiyuan Railway Bureau Bridge No. 2 Brigade Blindly and Recklessly Recruits Laborers, Neglecting Safety in Production
    Zhao Zhiyi of the CPC Zhuozi County Committee writes: This year, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Bridge No. 2 Brigade, in its work on constructing the Yifeng Bridge spillway dam in Zhuozi County, Suiyuan Province, violated labor policies by privately hiring hundreds of farmers from the Badicun village area in the county to break stones for ballast without contacting the labor department of the Zhuozi County government. This brigade's practice of blindly and recklessly recruiting laborers seriously hindered local agricultural production. For example, out of 244 laborers in Badicun village, 170 were hired to break stones. The natural villages of Magaitu and Hulan Hada even completely stopped agricultural production for two days as a result.
    In addition, the brigade also entered into unreasonable "contracting agreements" with the farmers, which stipulated that "the contractor shall be responsible for any accidents that occur during work." In this way, the brigade did not provide any leadership to the quarry or the stone-breaking laborers, did not oversee safety equipment on site, and did not conduct safety education for the laborers. On the afternoon of May 5th, a serious accident occurred in the quarry when a 500-jin stone rolled down the mountain and knocked the laborer Yan Tiande unconscious. After the laborers administered first aid to him, they requested treatment from the brigade. However, the person in charge of the brigade ignored them and even said: "The contract stipulates that we don't care even if someone is crushed to death." The laborers had no choice but to pool some money and send Yan Tiande to the Zhuozi County Health Clinic for treatment. Yan Tiande's injuries were severe, and he has not yet recovered; but the brigade has never reported such a serious accident to the government labor department, attempting to cover it up.
    The Taiyuan Railway Bureau Bridge No. 2 Brigade's erroneous behavior of randomly recruiting laborers in rural areas, neglecting the safety of laborers' lives, and concealing and failing to report personal injury accidents should be promptly inspected and corrected by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau.

### 太原铁路管理局桥梁二大队盲目乱招民工忽视安全生产

    太原铁路管理局桥梁二大队盲目乱招民工忽视安全生产
    中共卓资县委会赵志毅来信：太原铁路管理局桥梁第二大队今年在绥远省卓资县修建义丰桥梁顺水坝工作中违反劳动政策，不和卓资县政府劳动部门联系，就私自在该县坝底村一带雇用几百个农民打石碴。该队这种盲目乱招民工的做法，严重地妨碍了当地的农业生产。如坝底村共有劳动力二百四十四名，被雇去打石碴的竟达一百七十名。马盖图和忽阑哈达两个自然村，竟因此有两天完全停止农业生产。
    此外，该队又和农民们订立了不合理的“包工合同”，合同中规定“在工作中发生任何事故，均由承包人负责”。这样，该队对于采石场和采石民工根本不加领导，对现场的安全设备也不过问，更不向民工进行安全教育。五月五日下午，采石场发生了五百斤重的石头从山上滚下来，把民工阎天德砸昏的严重事故。民工们对他施行急救后，要求队上予以治疗。但该队负责人置之不理，竟说：“合同上订的就是砸死人我们也不管。”民工们没法，只好大家凑点钱把阎天德送往卓资县卫生院治疗。阎天德伤势很重，迄今还未痊愈；而该队对于这样的严重事故，竟始终不向政府劳动部门报告，企图掩盖过去了事。
    太原铁路管理局桥梁第二大队在农村乱招民工以及不关心民工生命安全、隐匿人身事故不报的错误行为，太原铁路管理局应该迅速进行检查并加以纠正。
