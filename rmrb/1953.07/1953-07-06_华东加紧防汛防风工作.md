Xinhua News Agency Report: East China is currently in the flood season and typhoon season, and the local people are stepping up their prevention work.

The provinces and most special districts in East China have successively established flood control agencies, and flood control organizations at the county, district, and township levels are also being established one after another. This year, all localities are paying special attention to strengthening the forecast of flood conditions and wind direction. So far, the provinces have established more than 290 flood reporting stations in areas along the Yangtze River, along the coast, along the Huai River, and in important river areas. The Shanghai and local meteorological stations provide weather information to flood control agencies above the provincial level every day. Since June, East China and provincial people's broadcasting stations have been broadcasting the direction and force of typhoon attacks at any time.
