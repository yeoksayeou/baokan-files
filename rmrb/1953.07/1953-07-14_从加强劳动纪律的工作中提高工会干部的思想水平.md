    Raising the Ideological Level of Trade Union Cadres Through Strengthening Labor Discipline
    Today, our newspaper publishes articles by Comrade Xing Shengfu and other grassroots trade union cadres. In the process of educating workers on labor discipline, they have gained new understandings of many issues. The questions and thoughts they raise in their articles are representative of the ideological and working conditions of the majority of our grassroots trade union cadres.
    In recent years, the broad masses of grassroots trade union cadres have worked diligently and enthusiastically, accomplishing a great deal. However, on what ideological foundation is this work enthusiasm built? They instinctively feel that they were elected by the workers and should work for the welfare of the workers. However, many of them, due to their limited political level, do not have a clear understanding of the nature and tasks of the trade union. Therefore, on many issues, such as how to truly safeguard the fundamental interests of the working class, how to firmly stand on the position of the working class, how to improve the welfare of the workers, why the trade union is also responsible for production, and what the correct relationship between the trade union and administration is, they have developed one-sided views. As Li Shisen and Sun Keting have confessed, their understanding is incomplete and their vision is short-sighted.
    Why have they neglected or even abandoned conducting communist education among the workers in the past? This is because their understanding of the trade union as a "school of communism" is vague. Therefore, when they see the relaxation of labor discipline and the existence of selfishness, laziness, disorganization, and indiscipline among some workers, influenced by bourgeois ideology, they do not know how to actively solve these problems through communist education, feeling helpless, or even pretending not to see these phenomena.
    Why are they so busy working for the welfare of the workers all day long, yet they are still detached from the masses? This is because their vision is short-sighted; they only see the immediate and personal interests of the workers, and not the long-term and overall interests of the entire working class. Thus, they are busy all day buying bicycles, yarn, and socks for the workers, looking for cheap things everywhere, turning the "school of communism" into a "welfare department" and a "cooperative." They fail to see the major issues related to production. In addition, influenced by the erroneous idea that the trade union has a "specific position," they regard production as the responsibility of the administration, so they do not pay attention to the serious phenomenon of relaxed labor discipline. When someone raises this issue, they even say that the workers' level of awareness is low, and they cannot be asked to be too strict. They do not educate the workers, but instead cater to backwardness. Even when the administration proposes to punish individuals who seriously violate labor discipline, they stubbornly disagree in order to "safeguard the interests of the working class."
    In this process of educating on labor discipline, they educated the worker masses; and the worker masses, in turn, profoundly educated them through their own actions. As Xing Shengfu, Hu Yuzhen, and many other comrades have said, many problems that could not be solved in the past have now been solved; many "backward" workers in the past have now transformed, and have made significant achievements in production. This has greatly moved them. From this, they have realized that the reason for the relaxation of labor discipline, which has not been corrected for a long time, lies in the thinking of the cadres and in the work of the trade union. In the past, they did not dare to educate the worker masses, did not educate them, did not educate them sufficiently, or did not educate them appropriately. Now they recognize the importance of conducting communist education among the workers, have raised their ideological level, and have further criticized their past erroneous understandings.
    The articles by Xing Shengfu and other comrades also serve as a very practical education for the Party organizations and trade union leaders in various enterprises. We must seize the rich materials exposed in the process of strengthening labor discipline, analyze and study them, and use them purposefully and with emphasis to educate the broad masses of grassroots cadres. This kind of education, which combines theory with practice and has lively content, can more effectively help grassroots trade union cadres improve their ideological level, thereby thoroughly eliminating the influence of the erroneous idea of "trade union's specific position" on grassroots trade union cadres, recognizing the harm of economism and tailism, establishing the idea that living standards can only be improved on the basis of developing production, and clearly recognizing the consistency between the long-term and overall interests of the working class and the immediate and personal interests of the workers, so that the broad masses of grassroots trade union cadres truly understand that the trade union is a school of communism.
    We believe that if the ideological level of the broad masses of grassroots trade union cadres is raised, their work enthusiasm and initiative will certainly be brought into fuller play, and they will certainly be able to smoothly implement the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union of China, and play the trade union's due role of mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of workers, uniting them closely around the Party, and bravely advancing towards the great task of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to socialism.

### 从加强劳动纪律的工作中提高工会干部的思想水平

    从加强劳动纪律的工作中提高工会干部的思想水平
    今天本报发表了邢生福同志等几个工会基层干部的文章。他们在对职工进行劳动纪律的教育过程中，对于许多问题有了新的认识。他们在文章中所提出的问题和思想情况，是可以代表我们工会广大基层干部中的思想和工作状况的。
    几年来，工会的广大基层干部，在工作中勤勤恳恳，很热情地做了很多事情。但是，他们这种工作热情，是建立在什么思想基础之上的呢？他们直感地认为自己是工人选举出来的，应该为工人谋福利。但是，他们之中很多人对工会的性质和任务，都由于自己政治水平的限制，认识还不清楚，所以在许多问题上，如究竟怎样才是维护工人阶级的根本利益，怎样才是站稳了工人阶级的立场，怎样才能搞好工人的福利，为什么工会对生产也要负责，工会和行政的正确关系如何，等等，都产生了片面的看法。正像李世森、孙克庭所检讨的，他们的认识不全面，眼光短浅。
    为什么他们过去放松甚至放弃了对工人进行共产主义教育呢？这是由于他们对工会是“共产主义的学校”这一点，认识模糊，所以眼看着劳动纪律松弛，某些工人中存在着自私自利，怠惰散漫，无组织无纪律，受到了资产阶级思想的侵袭，他们也不知道应该积极地用共产主义教育的方法去解决，而感到束手无策，甚至看见了那些现象，只好装着没有看见。
    为什么他们辛辛苦苦地整天为工人谋福利，结果还是脱离了群众呢？这是由于他们眼光短浅，只看见工人眼前的、个人的利益，看不见整个工人阶级长远的、整体的利益。于是他们整天忙着给工人买自行车、买毛线、买袜子，到处打听买便宜的东西，把“共产主义的学校”办成了“福利部”和“合作社”。他们看不到对于生产有关的大问题。加上他们受到所谓工会有“具体立场”错误思想的影响，他们把生产看成是行政上的事，以致对于劳动纪律松弛的严重现象，不去过问。当有人提出了这个问题，他们还说工人觉悟程度低，不能要求太严格了。他们不去对工人进行教育，而一味迁就落后。甚至于行政上提出对于个别严重破坏劳动纪律的分子，要给予处分，他们却为了“维护工人阶级利益”，硬不同意。
    在这次进行劳动纪律的教育过程中，他们教育了工人群众；工人群众又以自己的实际行动，深刻地教育了他们。正如邢生福、胡玉珍等许多同志所说的那样，过去许多解决不了的问题现在解决了；许多过去“落后”的工人现在转变了，并且在生产上有了显著的成绩。这使得他们很受感动。他们由此认识到，影响劳动纪律松弛，长期未能纠正，问题就在于干部的思想，在于工会的工作。过去他们对工人群众不敢进行教育，没有教育，教育得不充分以及教育得不适当。现在他们认识了对工人进行共产主义教育的重要性，提高了思想水平，进一步批判了过去的错误认识。
    邢生福以及其他同志的文章，对于各企业中党的组织和工会的领导干部来说，也是一种很实际的教育。我们要抓紧加强劳动纪律过程中所暴露出来的丰富的材料，加以分析研究，有目的、有重点地用来教育广大基层干部。这种结合实际，有生动内容的教育，更能有效地帮助工会基层干部提高思想水平，借以彻底肃清“工会具体立场”的错误思想对工会基层干部的影响，认清经济主义、尾巴主义的危害性，树立在发展生产的基础上才能改善生活的思想，明确认识工人阶级长远的整体的利益与工人眼前的个人的利益的一致性，使广大工会基层干部，真正懂得工会是共产主义的学校。
    我们相信，广大工会基层干部如果思想提高了，他们的工作热情和积极性，一定能得到更充分的发挥，一定能够顺利地贯彻执行中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议，发挥工会应有的动员和组织的作用，把广大工人群众，紧紧地团结在党的周围，为实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义的伟大任务而奋勇前进。
