(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 30) The Korean Military Armistice Commission held its third meeting on July 30.

    At the meeting, the chief delegate of the Korean and Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, notified the United Nations Command side that the advance personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from Poland and Czechoslovakia had entered Korea and were on their way to Panmunjom. It was estimated that they would be able to meet with the representatives of Switzerland and Sweden of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee in Panmunjom within two or three days.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho also notified United Nations Command side that the Korean and Chinese side had appointed Colonel Kim Moo-ji and Colonel Park Yong-pal as members of the Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians in Returning Home. The United Nations Command side stated that it would also appoint representatives of the United Nations Command to attend the Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians in Returning Home as soon as possible. According to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, the Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians in Returning Home, under the overall supervision of the Military Armistice Commission, will be responsible for assisting civilians displaced during the war to return to their homes after the armistice.

    At the Military Armistice Commission on July 30, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho also brought to the attention of the United Nations Command the incident in which a military aircraft of the United Nations Command violated the Armistice Agreement by intruding into the airspace over the Yuhyun Mountain position and the Ganmu Peak position on the Korean and Chinese side for about ten minutes around 3:00 AM on July 29, and again from 4:15 AM to 4:20 AM on the same day, circling for reconnaissance. On the same day, the chief delegates of both sides approved the agreement reached by the staff officers of both sides on July 29 on several specific issues regarding how the Joint Observer Teams would carry out their tasks. All ten Joint Observer Teams departed on July 30 to carry out their tasks.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 30) The members of the Joint Observer Teams of the Military Armistice Commission on the Korean and Chinese side have been jointly appointed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Our team members of the fourth to tenth groups departed from Kaesong on the morning of the 30th and proceeded to their designated work areas through our area. They will meet with the US team members at the designated locations on July 31 and August 2, respectively, to begin their duties. The third group of the Joint Observer Teams assigned to the Kaesong area has agreed to meet in Panmunjom at any time. Our team members of the first and second groups of the Joint Observer Teams assigned to the Han River estuary are on standby for departure.

    According to the agreement between the two sides, each team consists of four to six members, with each side appointing half of the team members and appointing the chief team member. The chief team members appointed by the Korean and Chinese side are: First Team: Colonel Lu Yin-hee of the Korean People's Army; Second Team: Colonel Kim Yeon-sung of the Korean People's Army; Third Team: Colonel Hu Xu of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Fourth Team: Colonel Li Shengtang of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Fifth Team: Colonel Xie Changhua of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Sixth Team: Colonel Wang Xinqun of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Seventh Team: Colonel Bai Bingxun of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Eighth Team: Colonel Yao Xiaocheng of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Ninth Team: Colonel Yao Zhangxian of the Korean People's Army; Tenth Team: Colonel Kim Doo-hong of the Korean People's Army.

    Relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement stipulate that the task of the Joint Observer Teams is to assist the Military Armistice Commission in supervising the execution of the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the Demilitarized Zone and the Han River estuary. The Joint Observer Teams are dispatched by the Military Armistice Commission or the chief delegate of either side to investigate reported violations of the agreement. The Joint Observer Teams submit periodic reports required by the Military Armistice Commission and submit special reports that the Joint Observer Teams deem necessary or that the Military Armistice Commission requires. In the early stages of the armistice, the specific task of the Joint Observer Teams is to supervise the establishment of markers along the military demarcation line and the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone, as well as the withdrawal of all armed forces, equipment, and supplies from the demilitarized zone, and the removal of dangerous materials in the demilitarized zone, in order to establish a demilitarized zone that prevents the recurrence of incidents that may lead to the resumption of hostilities as a buffer zone between the opposing sides. The two sides have agreed in principle to divide the demilitarized zone, along with the Han River estuary, into ten sections, each approximately 20 to 30 kilometers wide, for inspection by ten Joint Observer Teams.
