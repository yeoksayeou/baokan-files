Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, July 25th (By our special correspondent Wu Min) - The spacious T-shaped hall has been built and is ready to be used as the site for the signing of the armistice agreement in Panmunjom. However, the date for the signing of the armistice agreement is yet to be determined and announced by the liaison officers' meeting.

This yellow T-shaped hall has now become a prominent feature in the rice paddies and rolling hills of Panmunjom. When entering this conference area from Kaesong, the first thing that catches the eye is this newly built hall with its beautiful Korean-style roof and eaves, overlooking many tents and the current conference room, which was once the largest building in Panmunjom. This spacious hall has latticed windows and wooden floors, and it was built by Korean and Chinese workers at top speed in just five days.

Over the past seven days, liaison officers and staff have been meeting daily to complete the necessary preparations for the signing of the armistice agreement. These include: demarcating the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, finalizing the full text of the armistice agreement, and arranging the signing of the armistice agreement. In Panmunjom, as the meetings have accelerated, the duration and frequency of the meetings have gradually decreased. This indicates that preparations for the signing of the armistice agreement are nearing completion.

Today, staff assistants were seen taking maps into the conference room, apparently to make a final check of the northern and southern boundaries of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. They have not met for several days since the staff worked in front of the maps until after midnight on July 22nd. The interpreters have also not met for three days and are scheduled to meet this afternoon to make a final check of the documents.

If the Syngman Rhee government does not disrupt the preparations for the signing of the armistice agreement again at the last minute, then the signing of the armistice agreement is imminent.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 25th (By our special correspondent Jiang Nan) - After Syngman Rhee threatened to adopt a "unilateral policy" yesterday, his Washington master quickly opened his purse again. The U.S. government has promised to give Syngman Rhee $200 million soon as the first batch of appropriations for the so-called "revival of South Korea." The Associated Press reported that this was to "appease Syngman Rhee's anger" and to show "America's sincerity in assisting him."

On the surface, it seems a bit comical, as if Syngman Rhee is leading his master by the nose. However, it would be a big mistake to think that Syngman Rhee can dance without following the tune of the dollar. Today, Dulles gave Syngman Rhee another letter. People do not know what tune is being sung in this letter, but it is certainly more ear-splitting than the tunes Dulles has been openly singing in the past few days to encourage Syngman Rhee. The evidence is: Syngman Rhee's American spokesman, Vice President of United Press International, Kingsbury Smith, said that Syngman Rhee was "very pleased" after reading the letter; Syngman Rhee's Korean spokesman, his Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai, also said that Syngman Rhee's statement yesterday "remains valid" and "has not changed his anti-armistice attitude."

The fact is as the Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" editorial said today: "It is no longer a secret that the lackeys in the Eisenhower administration are secretly trying to encourage Syngman Rhee to carry out his sabotage activities. Influential Republicans such as Senators McCarthy and Taft are engaged in activities to break off the armistice negotiations." These warmongers in the U.S. ruling class do not care about the pockets of American taxpayers; they promise to give Syngman Rhee $200 million first when he asks for more than $1 billion. These people also do not value the lives of American youth; they promise to provide military support when Syngman Rhee clamors for continuing the war. What these people care about is making war profits, so they encourage Syngman Rhee to disrupt the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom; even if it cannot be done now, they will not give up this attempt after the armistice.

From many signs, the negotiations in Panmunjom are nearing completion, and the signing of the armistice agreement is in sight. But it would be too naive to think that American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee clique do not want to disrupt the armistice at the last minute. On the eve of these historically significant days, people must maintain a higher degree of vigilance to make the possibility of a Korean armistice a reality, and after the armistice agreement is signed, continue to work hard to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 签订朝鲜停战协定的准备工作将告完成  仍须警惕美国好战分子和李承晚破坏停战

    签订朝鲜停战协定的准备工作将告完成
    仍须警惕美国好战分子和李承晚破坏停战
    【新华社板门店二十五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：宽敞的丁字形大厅已经建筑好，准备用作在板门店签订停战协定的地点。但签订停战协定的日期尚待联络官会议确定并公布。
    这个黄色的丁字形大厅现在已成了板门店稻田与起伏的山丘中的一个特出的景物。从开城进入这个会场区时，第一个引人注目的东西就是这座有着朝鲜式屋顶和屋檐的优美的线条的新建的大厅，?瞰着许多帐篷和目前的会议室。目前的会议室曾经一度是板门店的最大的建筑物。这座宽敞的大厅有格子窗，有木嵌的地板，它是朝中工人在短短的五天内以最快的速度建筑起来的。
    在过去七天中，联络官和参谋人员一直每天开会，以完成必要的准备工作，使停战协定得以签订。其中包括：划定军事分界线和非军事区，停战协定全文最后定稿和布置停战协定签字事宜。在板门店，会议加速进行后，会议的时间和次数已逐渐减少。这就说明了，签订停战协定的准备工作将告完竣。
    今天看见参谋助理人员带了地图进入会议室，他们显然要把军事分界线与非军事区的南沿和北沿的地图作最后的核对。自从七月二十二日参谋人员在地图面前工作直至半夜以后，他们已经有几天没有开会了。译员也已有三天没有开会，他们定于今天下午开会，把文件作最后的核对。
    如果李承晚政府不在最后一刻再度打断签订停战协定的准备工作的话，那末，签订停战协定已迫在眉睫了。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在李承晚昨天要挟着要采取“片面政策”后，他的华盛顿主人很快又打开他的钱袋了。美国政府已答应不久就可以给李承晚两亿美元，作为所谓“复兴南朝鲜”的第一批拨款。美联社的消息说，这是为了“平平李承晚的怒火”，并且表示“美国具有诚意协助他”。
    表面看来有些滑稽，似乎是李承晚牵着他的主人的鼻子走。但是，如果谁以为李承晚可以不按美元的调子跳舞，那他就大错特错了。今天杜勒斯又给了李承晚一封信。人们不知道这封信里面唱的是什么调子，但可以肯定它比杜勒斯过去几天中公开唱的鼓励李承晚的调子更刺耳。证据是：李承晚的美国代言人——合众社副社长霍布雷奇特说，李承晚看了这封信后“非常高兴”；李承晚的朝鲜代言人——他的外务部长官卞荣泰也说，李承晚昨天的声明“仍然有效”，“并没有改变反停战的态度”。
    事实正如印度“甘露市场报”今天的社论所说的：“艾森豪威尔政府中的僚属正在暗地尽力鼓励李承晚进行其破坏活动，这已不再是秘密了。有势力的共和党人如参议员麦卡锡和塔夫脱，正从事活动要使停战谈判破裂。”美国统治阶级中这些好战分子并不关心美国纳税人的口袋，李承晚要十多亿美元，他们就答应先给二亿美元。这些人也不把美国青年的生命放在眼里，李承晚叫嚣继续战争，他们就答应将给予军事支援。这些人关心的是他们要发战争财，所以他们鼓励李承晚破坏板门店停战谈判；即使现在办不到，就在停战以后也不会放弃这种企图。
    从许多迹象看来，板门店的谈判已近于完成，停战协定的签订在望。但如果以为美国好战分子和李承晚集团不想在最后一刻破坏停战，那就太天真了。在这有历史意义的日子的前夕，人们必须保持更高度的警惕，使朝鲜停战的可能性成为现实，而在停战协定签订之后，更要继续努力，使朝鲜问题获得和平解决。
