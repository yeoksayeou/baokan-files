The General Branch of the Bunan Township, Junan County, Shandong Province
Organized and Promoted Spring Production Through the Propaganda Network
Xi Xingjia

    In order to further strengthen the Party's propaganda work on rural production, the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Bunan Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, reorganized the organization of the propaganda network in conjunction with spring plowing production, thereby strengthening the political and ideological leadership of the mutual aid groups and widely promoting production technology, which promoted spring plowing production work.

    Propaganda Network Organization With No One in Charge

    Bunan Township is a township in District One of Junan County with a relatively good work foundation. Since the establishment of the propaganda network in June 1951, propagandists have played a certain role in various campaigns. However, due to the lack of serious leadership from the Party organizations at the district and township levels, there are still many problems in this work, mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, there is no distinction between the Party's propagandists and the mass propaganda team, so propagandists are not selected according to the prescribed conditions, resulting in lower quality of the selected propagandists. Most of the propagandists in the township are young women from literacy classes. They are capable of general political propaganda, but appear to be "laymen" in agricultural production propaganda. Second, propagandists are not selected through branch review and approval by the higher-level Party committee, but are elected at mass meetings. The tasks of the propagandists and the purpose of establishing the propaganda network organization are not explained during the election, so a group of propagandists are elected in a "muddled" way. Some propagandists still do not understand how they should work. Sometimes, when the county and district hold meetings of propagandist representatives, township and village cadres often send a "representative" to deal with the matter, regardless of whether they are propagandists. The "representative" does not make a serious transmission and deployment after returning from the meeting. As a result, most propagandists cannot play a regular role, or do not play a role at all. Third, the branch's leadership and use of propagandists is only for the purpose of carrying out a specific work task, and no regular propagandist meeting system has been established. As Wang Lianman, a propagandist from Xinglongdian Village, reflected: "When needed, they are grabbed for a meeting; when not needed, no one asks for months." Therefore, the propaganda network organization in this township appears to be "nominal" and does not play a significant role.

    Why is the propaganda network work in Bunan Township not well done? The main reason is that the Party organizations at the district, township, and village levels do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance and role of establishing the propaganda network, lack specific leadership, and no one has been responsible for it for a long time. From June of last year to March of this year, the district committee only held one meeting of propagandist representatives and imparted knowledge in batches once. After the district committee's propaganda committee member participated in the Party rectification work last June, no one was responsible for the propaganda work in this district. Most of the district committee members participated in Party rectification last winter and this spring. During the Party rectification, they did not pay attention to combining Party rectification to reorganize and improve the organization of the propaganda network. The township and village branches saw that the higher-ups were not in charge, so they relaxed their leadership. Therefore, some propagandists suspected "whether the propaganda network has been cancelled." This is the general situation before the reorganization of the propaganda network organization.

    Starting With Production, Inspect the Propaganda Network Work

    In order to strive to increase the yield per unit area, in early March, under the guidance and assistance of the county and district committees, the Bunan Township General Branch promoted Pan Yushan's experience in land preparation for high yield from Caogou Village, as well as the spring plowing and seedling protection experience of checking the number of seedlings, weighing the ears of grain, and calculating the yield from Guandi Village. After promoting these advanced experiences, many advanced figures and advanced mutual aid groups emerged in various townships, but some farmers still held a wait-and-see attitude and were unwilling to accept the new farming methods. At this time, district and township cadres studied how to solve this problem. Everyone believed that in order to transform the experience of increasing production into the actual actions of the broad masses, two tasks must be done well: one is that Party members take the lead and set an example; the other is ideological mobilization and good propaganda and education work. Because no matter what work is completed, it cannot be separated from propaganda. Without propaganda, one will commit coercion and commandism, and will turn good things into bad things. In this way, on the basis of the idea that to do a good job in production work, one must do a good job in propaganda work, and that rural propaganda work must serve production, the reorganization of the propaganda network organization began.

    The work of reorganizing the propaganda network organization started in Xinglongdian Village of this township. Zhang Chenglin, secretary of the township general branch, used his evening time to convene an enlarged meeting of the branch committee in this village. First, starting with the inspection of production, he reviewed the shortcomings of the general branch's leadership in the propaganda network work, and focused on explaining that one of the important reasons for committing coercion and commandism in the past was that the propaganda work was not done well, and the Party's policies were not brought to the masses in a timely manner. Zhang Chenglin also cited the example of using reading groups and blackboard newspapers to carry out propaganda and promote work when planting wheat last year, so that everyone further realized the importance of doing a good job in propaganda work. Then, the branch committee members also consciously examined the idea of ​​underestimating propaganda work in the past, and expressed that they would strengthen the propaganda network work. The next day, taking advantage of the idle time after the rain, the branch held a meeting of Party members. In addition to mobilizing Party members to take the lead in launching a seedling protection campaign, the meeting focused on explaining the important significance of establishing a propaganda network and the conditions for propagandists. This make-up lesson was very necessary. It not only made all Party members realize that doing a good job in propaganda work can promote production, but also realized that the propaganda network is a bridge for the Party to closely connect with the masses, and an effective method to overcome coercion and commandism.

    Adapt to Production Organization, Reorganize the Propaganda Network

    In the discussion of reorganizing the propaganda network work in the Xinglongdian Village Branch, the branch committee members felt that the method of establishing the propaganda network organization according to the system and according to the residential situation in the past was no longer suitable for the current situation and requirements of a large number of farmers being organized. In order to make the propaganda organization adapt to the needs of production, it was decided to set up propagandists with mutual aid groups as the unit. Propagandists who have already participated in the mutual aid group can be fixed in their group. In mutual aid groups without propagandists, propagandists must be re-established. Propagandists who do not meet the conditions should be mobilized to participate in reading groups or engage in blackboard newspapers. This is how the principle of reorganizing the propaganda network was determined. In order to maintain the political quality of propagandists and strengthen the propaganda of production technology, the Xinglongdian Village Branch selected propagandists according to the conditions of having the necessary political consciousness, setting an example in production labor and other work, being able to connect with the masses, and having the appropriate ability to undertake propaganda work. It also absorbed a group of non-Party activists and experienced old farmers who were more qualified as propagandists to serve as propagandists. Old farmers have prestige among the masses, and the masses are more likely to accept advanced production experience through their propaganda. The method of developing propagandists adopted the method of branch nomination, mutual aid group deliberation and discussion, township general branch review and approval, and mass meeting announcement. This strengthened the propagandists' sense of responsibility and increased their enthusiasm for work. Many propagandists encouraged each other and said: "This is nominated by the branch and recognized by everyone, so we must use as much effort as possible." After the reorganization of the propaganda network organization in Xinglongdian Village, each of the 19 mutual aid groups in the village, except for one temporary group that did not have the conditions to establish a propagandist, was equipped with one propagandist, and six others were responsible for running the blackboard newspaper. Among these 24 propagandists, there were 9 Party members, 8 League members, and 7 non-Party activists.

    Propaganda Work Promoted Production

    In order to make the propagandists immediately put into the spring plowing production propaganda, the Xinglongdian Village Branch convened a propagandist meeting. The meeting reviewed and summarized the past propaganda work, affirmed the achievements, and commended Wang Ximin and other three propagandists who have always been active in their work. At the same time, it arranged several major propaganda tasks regarding spring plowing and spring planting. In order to prevent the propaganda work from failing, it was stipulated after discussion at the meeting that in addition to establishing the necessary propagandist meeting system, the scope of activities and propaganda objects were determined according to the propagandists' activity ability. Wang Lianmi, deputy secretary of the branch, Wang Lianman, the branch's organization committee member, and Zhang Jirong, the propaganda committee member, in addition to doing a good job in the propaganda of their own groups, were also responsible for convening propagandist meetings and leading propagandists to study. In addition, every time work was deployed and inspected, the branch invited comrades from the work team to educate the propagandists on the basic knowledge of propagandists, so that the propagandists could understand the basic tasks of propagandists, the basic methods of propaganda work, and some relevant advanced production experiences, which effectively improved the propagandists' understanding of propaganda work and their ability to work.

    After the reorganization of the propaganda network in Bunan Township, generally speaking, the propagandists have become active. When mobilizing the masses to find fertilizers, the propagandists widely publicized the slogan "Open up fertilizer sources, solve difficulties, realize plans, and ensure increased production," which greatly increased the enthusiasm of the peasants for accumulating fertilizer. There are two blackboard newspapers in the village. During the spring plowing period, a total of 17 issues were published. Whenever good people and good deeds appeared in the village and township, the blackboard newspaper published them in a timely manner, and the propagandists used this as propaganda content and widely carried out propaganda. In particular, after propagating Pan Yushan's land preparation for high yield and the seedling protection experience of Guandi Village, it aroused everyone's interest in earnestly studying production technology. Some people measured their yards and calculated how many plants should be planted per mu and how much grain could be harvested. In this situation, the propagandists focused on seedling protection and carried out propaganda on a number of agricultural technology reforms, such as seed soaking, seed selection, equidistant spacing, wide sowing, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. This spring, the village has cultivated more than 600 mu of land, and built more than 100 ditches and embankments. In order to widen the sowing width and appropriately densely plant, the village transformed nine seed drills, so that 70% of the farmers improved their sowing methods, thus successfully completing the spring plowing production work. These are inseparable from the active activities of the propagandists.

    Summarize Experience, Promote Throughout the Township

    After summarizing the experience of Xinglongdian Village in reorganizing the propaganda network, the Bunan Township Party General Branch convened village branch committee meetings to make an introduction. Each village also reorganized the organization of the propaganda network. According to needs and possibilities, 85 of the 106 mutual aid groups in the township have set up propagandists, and the mutual aid groups without propagandists are actively cultivating and preparing to set up.

    Experience has proved that the advantage of establishing a propaganda network organization that adapts to the production organization is that propagandists can use the convenience of producing with mutual aid group members to carry out propaganda anytime and anywhere. This can not only solve the contradiction between the propagandists' propaganda activities and the production of group members, but also overcome the phenomenon that the propagandists do not understand the specific situation in the group, so that the propaganda is not in-depth and not specific. At the same time, since the propagandists have a fixed position for production and propaganda, it is also more convenient to implement the "contract system" of propaganda. The propaganda network work in Bunan Township is carried out through mutual aid organizations, focusing on the patriotic production increase campaign, thus promoting the central work and enriching the content of propaganda work at the same time.

    山东莒南县埠南乡总支部
    整理宣传网推动了春季生产
    席星加
    山东省莒南县中共埠南乡总支部为进一步加强党对农村生产的宣传工作，结合春耕生产整理了宣传网的组织，从而加强了对互助组的政治思想领导，普遍宣传了生产技术。推动了春耕生产工作。
    无人负责的宣传网组织
    埠南乡是莒南县一区工作基础较好的一个乡。一九五一年六月建立宣传网以来，宣传员在各种运动中曾起了一定的作用。但由于区、乡党的组织缺乏认真领导，所以这一工作还存在着许多问题，主要表现在以下几个方面：第一，没有把党的宣传员和群众宣传队伍加以区别，因而没有按照规定的条件去选拔宣传员，以致选拔出来的宣传员的质量较低。全乡大部分宣传员都是识字班的青年妇女，她们作一般性的政治宣传还可以，但对于农业生产的宣传就显得“外行”。第二，选拔宣传员时，不是经过支部审查通过，上一级党委批准，而是在群众大会上选举的。选举时没有说明宣传员的任务和建立宣传网组织的目的，就“糊里糊涂”地选出了一批宣传员。有的宣传员直到现在还不明白自己应该怎样去工作。有时，县、区召开宣传员代表会，而乡村干部往往不管是否宣传员就随便派一“代表”应付了事。“代表”开会回来，也不作认真的传达和布置。这样，大部分宣传员不能经常起作用，或根本不起作用。第三，支部对宣传员的领导和使用，只是为了突击某一工作任务，没有建立定期的宣传员会议制度。正如兴隆店村宣传员王连满反映的：“用得着时抓过来开个会，用不着时几个月没人问。”因此这个乡的宣传网组织显得“有名无实”，作用不大。
    埠南乡的宣传网工作为什么没有搞好呢？主要是由于区、乡、村各级党组织对建立宣传网的意义和作用认识不足，缺乏具体领导，长期无人负责所致。从去年六月到今年三月，区委只开过一次宣传员代表会，分片传授过一次。去年六月区委宣传委员参加了整党工作后，这个区的宣传工作就无人负责。去冬今春，区委委员大都参加了整党，在整党期间，也没注意结合整党来整理和提高宣传网的组织。乡、村支部看到上边不管，也就放松了领导。因此有的宣传员怀疑“是不是取消了宣传网”。这就是整理宣传网组织以前的大体情况。
    从生产入手，检查宣传网工作
    为了争取提高单位面积产量，三月初埠南乡总支在县委和区委的指示和帮助下，推广了草沟村潘玉善的整地丰产经验，以及官地村查棵数、称穗头、算产量的春耕保苗经验。经过推广这些先进经验之后，各乡都涌现了不少先进人物和先进的互助组，但也有部分农民还抱着观望态度，不肯接受新耕作法。这时区、乡干部就研究如何解决这个问题。大家认为：要把增产经验变成广大群众的实际行动，还必须作好两件工作：一件是党员带头，典型示范，作出样子；一件是思想动员，搞好宣传教育工作。因为不论完成一件什么工作都离不开宣传，不宣传就会犯强迫命令，就会把好事变成坏事。这样，就在干部一致认识了要搞好生产工作，必须作好宣传工作，而农村宣传工作又必须在为生产服务的思想基础上，开始着手整理宣传网组织。
    整理宣传网组织的工作是从这个乡的兴隆店村作起的。乡总支书记张成林利用晚上时间，在这个村召开了支委扩大会，首先从检查生产入手，联系检讨了总支领导宣传网工作中的缺点，并着重说明了过去犯强迫命令的重要原因之一，就是没有把宣传工作作好，没有把党的政策及时和群众见面。张成林又引用了去年种小麦时运用读报组、黑板报进行宣传、推动工作的实例，使大家进一步认识了作好宣传工作的重要性。接着支部委员们也都自觉地检查了过去轻视宣传工作的思想，表示要加强宣传网工作。第二天，趁雨后农闲空隙，支部召开了一次党员大会。会上除动员党员以身作则展开保苗运动外，并着重讲解了建立宣传网的重要意义和宣传员的条件。这一补课是十分必要的，它不仅使全体党员认识了作好宣传工作能推动生产，而且也体会到宣传网是党密切联系群众的桥梁，是克服强迫命令的有效方法。
    适应生产组织，整理宣传网
    兴隆店村支部在讨论整理宣传网工作中，支部委员们感到过去按系统、按居住情况建立宣传网组织的办法，已不适合目前农民大量组织起来的情况和要求。为使宣传组织适应生产需要，确定按互助组为单位设立宣传员。已参加互助组的宣传员，可固定到所在组，没有宣传员的互助组里，必须重新建立宣传员，对原有不够条件的宣传员则动员其参加读报组或搞黑板报。就这样确定了整理宣传网的原则。为了保持宣传员的政治质量，加强对生产技术的宣传，兴隆店村支部按照具有必要的政治觉悟，在生产劳动和其他工作中以身作则、能联系群众、并有担任宣传工作的适当能力等条件选择了宣传员，还吸收了一批比较够宣传员条件的非党积极分子和有生产经验的老农民来担任宣传员。老农民在群众中有威信，通过他们宣传先进生产经验，群众易于接受。发展宣传员的方法，采取了支部提名，互助组酝酿讨论，乡总支审查批准，群众大会公布的办法。这样加强了宣传员的责任感，提高了工作积极性。不少宣传员互相勉励说：“这是支部提名，大家公认的，有多大劲就得使多大劲。”兴隆店村的宣传网组织经过整理以后，全村十九个互助组，除一个临时组因为条件还不具备没有建立宣传员外，每组都设立了宣传员一人，另有六人负责办黑板报。在这二十四名宣传员中，有党员九人，团员八人，非党积极分子七人。
    宣传工作推动了生产
    为使宣传员立即投入春耕生产宣传，兴隆店村支部召开了宣传员大会。会上检查总结了过去的宣传工作，肯定了成绩，表扬了工作一贯积极的宣传员王希敏等三人。同时布置了关于春耕春种的几项主要宣传工作。为使宣传工作不落空，经大会讨论规定，除建立了必要的宣传员会议制度外，又按照宣传员的活动能力，确定了活动范围和宣传对象。支部副书记王连密，支部组织委员王连满，宣传委员张继荣三人，除作好本组宣传外，并负责召集宣传员会议，领导宣传员学习。另外，在每逢布置、检查工作的同时，支部都邀请工作组的同志向宣传员进行宣传员基本知识的教育，使宣传员了解宣传员的基本任务、宣传工作的基本方法，和一些有关先进生产经验等，这就有效地提高了宣传员对宣传工作的认识和工作能力。
    埠南乡的宣传网经过整理以后，一般说来宣传员都积极地活动起来了。在发动群众找肥料时，宣传员广泛地宣传了“开辟肥源，解决困难、实现计划，保证增产”的口号，大大提高了农民群众积肥的积极性。全村有两块黑板报，在春耕期间，共出版了十七期，每逢本村、本乡出现了好人好事，黑板报便及时刊登出来，宣传员也就以此作为宣传内容，广泛地进行宣传。特别在宣传了潘玉善整地丰产和官地村保苗经验后，引起了大家认真研究生产技术的兴趣。有的人步量着自己的院子，计算每亩应种植多少棵，能打多少粮食。在此情况下，宣传员又以保苗为重点，开展了若干农作技术改革的宣传，如浸种、选种、等距、宽播、防除病虫害等。今春该村共整地六百余亩，打堑、叠堰一百余道。为了加宽播幅，适当密植，全村改造耩子九把，使百分之七十的农户改善了播种方法，因而胜利地完成了春耕生产工作。这些都是和宣传员的积极活动分不开的。
    总结经验，全乡推广
    埠南乡党总支总结了兴隆店村整理宣传网的经验后，便分头召开了村支委会议作了介绍。各村也整理了宣传网的组织。根据需要与可能的情况，现全乡一百零六个互助组中已有八十五个组设立了宣传员，没有宣传员的互助组，正积极地培养和准备设立。
    经验证明：这种适应生产组织建立宣传网组织的好处是：宣传员可利用和互助组员一块生产的方便，随时随地进行宣传。这样既可解决宣传员的宣传活动和组员生产的矛盾，又可克服宣传员不了解组内具体情况，以致宣传不深入不具体的现象。同时，由于宣传员有了生产和宣传的固定阵地，也更便于实行宣传“包干制”。埠南乡的宣传网工作，就是通过互助组织，围绕着爱国增产运动而展开活动的，因而推动了中心工作，同时也丰富了宣传工作的内容。
