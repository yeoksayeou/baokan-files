The US and Soviet Union are hastily plotting new intrigues to invade Arab countries. Johnson's call for a "ceasefire" is just the beginning, and the Soviet revisionists want the United Nations to further intervene in the Middle East situation.

After supporting Israel's invasion of Arab countries, US imperialism is now, on one hand, directing Israel and, on the other, colluding with the Soviet revisionist clique through the United Nations to exert further pressure on Arab countries. They aim to force Arab countries to accept many humiliating conditions, paving the way for US expansion of neo-colonialist aggression in the Middle East.

After US Secretary of State Rusk reported on the Middle East situation in a secret meeting with senators on the 8th, Senator Symington gleefully said, "This may be the most favorable improvement in the world situation for the United States, because Israel is our best friend in the Middle East." According to the senators, Rusk gave them the impression that in the Middle East, "relations between each other are about to undergo a tremendous change."

The aggressive intentions of US imperialism have been fully exposed. On the 8th, US President Johnson wrote in a letter to Senator Mansfield, "The ceasefire is only the beginning. If this region is to have genuine stability, many fundamental issues must be resolved immediately." On the same day, US Representative to the United Nations Goldberg proposed a draft resolution in the Security Council, insidiously demanding that "the relevant parties" engage in "prompt discussions" after the "ceasefire," linking the implementation of the ceasefire with longer-term discussions, and including "all outstanding issues."

Before Israel launched its aggression, Canadian Prime Minister Pearson, who had held secret talks with Johnson, put forward a so-called "six-point plan" in accordance with the intentions of US imperialism on the 8th. Pearson demanded that the resolution of the Middle East issue be handled through the United Nations and that the four so-called major powers—US, Soviet Union, Britain, and France—assume "primary responsibility." His "six-point plan" includes making the Gulf of Aqaba in the United Arab Republic a "free international waterway"; dispatching a large "UN force" to be stationed in Israel and Arab countries; establishing a "demilitarized zone" between Israel and Arab countries; guaranteeing the navigation of Israeli ships in the Gulf of Aqaba; allowing Israel to obtain the right to navigate the Suez Canal; and having the United Nations handle the problem of Arab refugees expelled from Israel. This is actually to allow Israel to expand its aggression in the Arab region.

According to a report by the US *Christian Science Monitor* on the 7th, the US imperialist plan also includes preventing Arab countries from obtaining the weapons needed to resist Israeli aggression. The US government is also drafting a so-called "regional economic development system" to take advantage of the situation and further push neo-colonialism in the Middle East. Moreover, US imperialism will cooperate with the Soviet revisionist clique in this regard. According to the newspaper, "the economic and political plans provided by the two superpowers and their allies to the Middle East can proceed peacefully."

With the support and direction of US imperialism, the Zionist aggressors in Israel are extremely arrogant. On the 8th, when Israeli Foreign Minister Eban left New York to return home, he echoed Goldberg's tone in the United Nations, demanding that "peace conditions" in the Middle East be discussed under "direct negotiations" between Israel and Arab countries. This is actually to force Arab countries to recognize Israel. After returning to Israel on the 9th, Eban even more blatantly expressed his arrogant ambition to occupy Arab territories. He boasted, "Israel will not miss its opportunity. It will turn this opportunity into a new national and regional reality."

In the face of US imperialism's new savage attacks on Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique continues to collude closely with US imperialism, using further betrayals of the interests of the Arab people to engage in political deals with US imperialism.

After the US and Soviet Union manipulated the UN Security Council to pass two "resolutions" for "immediate ceasefire" and "ceasefire within a deadline," on the 9th, they passed another "resolution" for "immediate ceasefire" between Syria and Israel. Following this, at the initiative of the Soviet revisionist representative Fedlin, the Security Council adopted a motion for the relevant countries in the Middle East to "provide all possible cooperation to UN observers and allow them to act freely."

The Soviet revisionists' initiative directly responds to the demands of US imperialism. The US itself has already proposed a draft resolution in the Security Council to further extend UN influence into the Middle East. The US draft resolution demands that the relevant parties utilize "UN assistance," that the UN Secretary-General "immediately take steps" to provide "necessary assistance" to "ensure the ceasefire is observed." Meanwhile, according to a report by the United Press International on the 9th based on information from a "British authoritative diplomatic source," after "urgent correspondence at the highest level" between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union, "the initial outline of a preliminary plan for US-Soviet cooperation is taking shape," which will first involve "an agreement between the two superpowers to maintain a balance in Europe and the Middle East." Additionally, between the Arabs and Israelis, new guarantees and assurances will be made by the great powers and the United Nations with treaty approval, international supervision will be implemented for a period of time, and arms embargoes will be strengthened in the region.

However, no matter how closely US imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique cooperate, they will never be able to make the Arab people surrender. The era of great powers manipulating the Middle East situation has passed. The Arab people will surely smash all the intrigues and tricks of US imperialism and its accomplices, take control of their own destiny, and become the inviolable masters of the Middle East region.

### 美苏加紧策划侵略阿拉伯国家的新阴谋  约翰逊叫嚷“停火”只是“开端”，苏修要让联合国进一步干涉中东局势

    美苏加紧策划侵略阿拉伯国家的新阴谋
    约翰逊叫嚷“停火”只是“开端”，苏修要让联合国进一步干涉中东局势
    美帝国主义在支持以色列侵入阿拉伯国家以后，正在一方面指使以色列，同时勾结苏修集团通过联合国，对阿拉伯国家进一步施加压力，企图迫使阿拉伯国家接受许多屈辱的条件，为美国在中东地区扩张新殖民主义的侵略势力打开道路。
    美国国务卿腊斯克八日在秘密会议上向参议员们汇报中东局势以后，参议员赛明顿兴高采烈地说，“这也许是世界局势最有利于美国的一次改善，因为以色列是我们在中东最好的朋友。”据参议员们说，腊斯克给他们一种印象：在中东，“相互之间的关系即将发生巨大的变化”。
    美帝国主义的这种侵略意图，已经十分清楚地暴露。美国总统约翰逊八日在给参议员曼斯菲尔德的一封信中说，“停火只不过是一个开端，如果这个地区要有真正稳定的局面，必须立即解决许多基本问题。”美国驻联合国代表戈德堡八日在安理会提出了一项提案，别有用心地叫嚷“要求有关方面”在“停火”以后“迅速进行讨论”，“把实现停火同进行更长期的讨论联系起来”，“一切悬而未决的问题都应当包括进去”。
    在以色列发动侵略以前曾经同约翰逊进行过密谈的加拿大总理皮尔逊，按照美帝国主义的意图，在八日端出了一个所谓“六点计划”。皮尔逊要求有关中东问题的解决必须经过联合国，并且由美苏英法四个所谓大国承担“主要责任”。他的“六点计划”包括把阿联领海亚喀巴湾作为“自由国际航道”；派遣一支庞大的“联合国部队”驻在以色列和阿拉伯国家境内；在以色列和阿拉伯国家之间建立“非军事区”；保证以色列船只在亚喀巴湾航行；允许以色列得到在苏伊士运河中航行的权利；由联合国处理迁出以色列的阿拉伯难民问题。这实际上就是要让以色列对阿拉伯地区进行大肆的扩张侵略。
    据美国《基督教科学箴言报》在七日报道，美帝国主义的计划还包括制止阿拉伯国家获得抵抗以色列侵略所需要的军火武器。美国政府还在起草一个所谓“地区性的经济发展制度”，来乘机加紧在中东推行新殖民主义。而且美帝国主义将同苏修集团在这方面进行合作。据这家报纸说，美苏“两大国及其盟国向中东提供的经济和政治计划可以和平地并进”。
    在美帝国主义的支持和指使下，以色列犹太复国主义者气焰十分嚣张。以色列外长埃班八日离纽约回国时，就按照戈德堡在联合国里的腔调，叫嚷必须“在以色列和阿拉伯国家的直接谈判下”商讨中东的所谓“和平条件”。这实际上就是要迫使阿拉伯国家承认以色列。埃班在九日回到以色列以后，更是露骨地表示了侵占阿拉伯国家领土的狂妄野心。他叫嚣说：“以色列决不放过它的机会。它将要把这个机会变成新的国家和地区性的现实。”
    在美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家发动新的猖狂进攻中，苏修集团仍然同美帝国主义密切勾结，用进一步出卖阿拉伯人民的利益来同美帝国主义大做政治交易。
    美苏操纵联合国安全理事会接连通过“立即停火”、“限期停火”的两个“决议”以后，九日又通过了要叙利亚和以色列之间“立即停火”的“决议”。接着，就在苏修代表费德林的倡议下，安理会通过了一项动议，要中东地区有关国家“向联合国观察员提供一切可能的合作，并且让他们自由行动”。
    苏修的这个倡议，直接响应了美帝国主义的要求。美国自己也已经在安理会提出提案，要进一步把联合国势力伸进中东去。美国的提案里，要有关各方利用“联合国的援助”，要联合国秘书长“立即采取步骤”，提供“必要的援助”，“以保证停火得到遵守”。与此同时，据合众国际社九日根据英国“权威外交人士”的消息报道说，美英苏之间经过“最高一级”“来往紧急的函电”，一项美苏合作的“初步方案的最初轮廓正在形成中”，“它首先将涉及俄美两国间的一项在欧洲和中东保持均势的协议”。此外，在阿拉伯人和以色列人之间，还要作出大国和联合国以条约赞同的新保障和保证，在今后一段时间里实行国际监督，并用对该地区的军火禁运来予以加强”。
    但是，不管美帝国主义和苏修集团怎样通力合作，狼狈为奸，他们决不能使阿拉伯人民屈膝投降。大国操纵中东局势的时代已经一去不复返了。阿拉伯人民必将粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶们的一切阴谋诡计，掌握自己的命运，成为中东地区的不容侵犯的主人。
