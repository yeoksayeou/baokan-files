The "Common Market," also known as the European Economic Community, was established on January 1, 1958. It is an economic bloc formed by six Western European countries to control and monopolize the Western European market and to resist American infiltration. It is a customs union in nature. The official members are: Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.

These six countries, in order to monopolize the production of coal and steel in Western Europe, established the European Coal and Steel Community as early as 1951. They also established the European Atomic Energy Community to jointly develop research on atomic energy. According to a resolution in February 1964, these three organizations have now been completely merged into one. The headquarters is located in Brussels, Belgium.

The establishment of the "Common Market," the "Coal and Steel Community," and the "Atomic Energy Community" has clear political objectives. This is to unite, strengthen their forces, and break away from American control. The strengthening of relations among the six countries in various aspects enables them to adopt a common stance on many issues to deal with the United States. For example, the six countries of the "Common Market" currently have a basically consistent stance on tariff issues, capitalist world currency reform issues, and the prevention of nuclear proliferation, which has caused the United States considerable headaches.

Although the six countries of the "Common Market" have common interests in resisting the United States, they are also riddled with internal contradictions. Since the establishment of the "Common Market," the struggle among the six countries has been intense. In particular, the two largest countries, France and West Germany, have not been able to reach an agreement on the issue of agricultural integration and the establishment of a political alliance.

    “共同市场”
    “共同市场”又名欧洲经济集团，成立于一九五八年一月，是西欧大陆六个国家为控制和垄断西欧市场，抵制美国渗透，而建立的关税同盟性质的经济集团。它的正式成员是：比利时、法国、西德、意、大利、卢森堡和荷兰。
    这六个国家为了垄断西欧大陆煤钢的生产，早在一九五一年就成立了欧洲“煤钢联营”。它们为了共同发展对原子能的研究，还建立了欧洲“原子能联营”机构。根据一九六四年二月的一项决议，现在这三个机构已经完全合并为一个。总部设在比利时的布鲁塞尔。
    “共同市场”、“煤钢联营”、“原子能联营”这三个组织的建立，带有明显的政治目的。这就是联合起来，加强实力，以摆脱美国的控制。六国之间在各方面关系的加强，使它们在许多问题上都可以用共同态度对付美国。例如，目前“共同市场”六国在关税问题上、资本主义世界货币改革问题上以及防止核扩散问题上，都是立场基本一致。使美国感到十分头痛。
    “共同市场”六国虽然在抵抗美国方面有共同利益，但是它们内部也是矛盾重重。从“共同市场”成立以来，六国之间的斗争就十分激烈。特别是它们中最大的两个国家法国和西德在农业一体化问题和建立政治联盟问题上始终达不成协议。
