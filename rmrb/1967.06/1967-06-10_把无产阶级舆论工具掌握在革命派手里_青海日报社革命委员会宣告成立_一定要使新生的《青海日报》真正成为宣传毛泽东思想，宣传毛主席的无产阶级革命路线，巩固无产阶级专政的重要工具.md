The means of mass media for the proletariat must be seized by the revolutionary faction. The Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily has been established. We must ensure that the newly born Qinghai Daily truly becomes an important tool for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, June 9th: The Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily has been formally established amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a new triumphant song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a new victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

On June 1st, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of Qinghai Daily, representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction from Xining region and some prefectures and counties in Qinghai Province, Red Guards, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives of the Beijing Red Guard Delegation to Qinghai gathered to celebrate the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily. They joyfully shouted that the power of Qinghai Daily is now in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. They pointed out that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily is the result of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the newspaper, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, and with the great support of the proletarian revolutionary factions such as the "August 18th" in Qinghai Province and the Red Guards from other places. They have shown the great fearless spirit of daring to think, dare to do, dare to venture, and dare to revolutionize, and have firmly fought against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. It is a major victory won by the proletarian revolutionary faction after breaking through numerous difficulties and overcoming waves of storms.

The celebration of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily began with the majestic melody of "The East is Red." The proletarian revolutionary faction and the PLA soldiers present, with hearts full of excitement, expressed their common sentiment: Long live our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, forever and ever! Wish Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, good health and eternal health!

Program Guanguan, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily, addressed the meeting. On behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily, the Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Command, and all revolutionary workers, he extended a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to the representatives of the Qinghai Provincial Military Control Commission and the People's Liberation Army, to the close comrades-in-arms of the proletarian revolutionary factions such as the "August 18th," and to the representatives of the Beijing Red Guard Delegation to Qinghai and other proletarian revolutionary factions from outside.

Liu Xianquan, Commander of the Qinghai Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Qinghai Military Region and the stationed troops, extended the warmest congratulations and firm support to the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily. He also hoped that the newly born Qinghai Daily, at this critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary factions are launching a great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and at the handful of power-holders within the Qinghai Province who are taking the capitalist road. He hoped that they would be overthrown and exposed politically, ideologically, and theoretically, promoting the great unity of the revolution and the "three-in-one combination," and striving for the victory of the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai Province. Liu Xianquan also hoped that the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions would, in the struggle, study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, work hard on the use of words, break with the self, establish the public, and promote the thought revolutionization, sparing no effort to run the newly born Qinghai Daily well, making Qinghai Daily truly an important tool for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, propagating the Party's policies, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, letting Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy the newspaper battlefield.

Dai Yanshun, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily, reported on the summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Qinghai Daily over the past year on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Daily and the Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Command.

The representatives of the Beijing Red Guard Delegation to Qinghai, representatives of a certain unit of the stationed troops, and representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions such as the "August 18th" Revolutionary Rebel Joint Committee of Qinghai Province, the Revolutionary Committee of Qinghai Radio Station (Station), the "August 18th" Red Guard Combat Team, the Red Propaganda Soldiers of Qinghai, the Joint Command of the Red Rebels of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee, the Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Public Security Line of Qinghai, and the Joint Command of the Revolutionary Rebels of the Public Security of Qinghai spoke one after another at the meeting. The meeting also received more than forty congratulatory letters and words from various units of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The speeches at the meeting and the congratulatory letters and words received all expressed that the proletarian revolutionary factions must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly grasp the proletarian throat in their own hands, making the newly born Qinghai Daily truly a red stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The meeting finally unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.
