Arab revolutionary people highly praise Chairman Mao as the greatest genius, the most outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time, and the greatest leader and teacher of the people of the world today.

A Palestinian worker, facing a portrait of Chairman Mao, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao, you are our beloved leader. In today's world, Chairman Mao, you are the one who understands our sufferings the most and supports our struggle the most. I will forever be your loyal soldier!" Palestinian friend Ahmad said, "I have read some of Chairman Mao's works and have increasingly come to realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for all oppressed peoples of the world to achieve liberation, and it is also our guide for Palestinian refugees to liberate our homeland and return home. We Palestinian refugees will use the spirit of moving mountains taught by Chairman Mao to remove the great mountains of imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries that weigh on our heads."

A progressive person from Syria recently wrote, "Chairman Mao is the most outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism and world capitalism are heading towards collapse and the socialist revolution is heading towards global victory." Some Syrian friends also pointed out that Chairman Mao leads not only the 700 million people of China but also the people of the world in revolutionary struggle.

A young person from Iraq said, "Chairman Mao is indeed the greatest genius and revolutionary teacher of our time. The revolutionary people of the world place their hopes in Chairman Mao—the red sun in the hearts of the people in struggle."

An old taxi driver from Lebanon said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is too great. It is Mao Zedong and the 700 million Chinese people under his leadership who resolutely support the Vietnamese people, the Palestinian people, and other oppressed peoples in their struggle against imperialism. Mao Zedong is the great leader of our time." Another young taxi driver asked the reporter for a Chairman Mao badge, and after receiving it, he immediately pinned it to his chest and shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the People's Republic of China!"

A Lebanese journalist said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. We greatly admire him and thank him for his tremendous contributions to the anti-imperialist cause of the Asian and African peoples."

A Lebanese friend who has read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of revolution. 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is the crystallization of the precious experience of the great Chinese revolution. Through reading this precious book, we have been greatly inspired."

A Lebanese friend who had visited China said, "Without Mao Zedong, there would be no great victory of the Chinese revolution and all the great achievements of China. You have the atomic bomb because you have Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is stronger than any atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb. We, like you, feel very fortunate to have Chairman Mao as our great leader."

    阿拉伯人民颂扬毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖
    毛主席最支持我们的反帝斗争
    据新华社讯　阿拉伯革命人民高度颂扬毛主席是当代最伟大的天才、最杰出的马克思列宁主义者，是当代世界人民最伟大的领袖和导师。
    一位巴勒斯坦工人对着毛主席像激动地说：“毛主席啊，您是我们敬爱的领袖。在今天的世界上，毛主席，是您最了解我们的疾苦，最支持我们的斗争。我要永远作您的忠诚战士！”巴勒斯坦朋友艾哈迈德说：“我读过毛主席的一些著作，越来越认识到，毛泽东思想是全世界被压迫人民走向解放道路的指南，也是我们巴勒斯坦难民解放自己祖国、重返家园的指南。我们巴勒斯坦难民要用毛主席教导的愚公移山的精神来搬掉压在我们头上的帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派的大山。”
    叙利亚一位进步人士不久前著文说：“毛主席是当代最杰出的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想是帝国主义和世界资本主义势力走向崩溃、社会主义革命走向全世界胜利的时代的最高最活的马克思列宁主义。”有些叙利亚朋友还指出，毛主席不仅领导着七亿中国人民而且也领导着全世界人民进行革命斗争。
    伊拉克一位青年说：“毛主席的确是当代最伟大的天才和革命的导师。世界革命人民把希望寄托于毛主席——斗争中的人民的心中的红太阳。”
    黎巴嫩一位老出租汽车司机说：“毛泽东主席太伟大了。正是毛泽东和在他领导下的七亿中国人民坚决地支持了越南人民、巴勒斯坦人民和其他被压迫人民反对帝国主义的斗争。毛泽东是当代的伟大领袖。”另一位年轻的出租汽车司机向记者索取毛主席像章，他拿到后立即别在自己的胸前，并高呼：“毛泽东万岁！人民中国万岁！”
    一位黎巴嫩新闻工作者说：“毛主席是中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖。我们非常敬佩他，感谢他对亚非人民反帝事业作出的巨大贡献。”
    一位读过《毛主席语录》的黎巴嫩朋友说：“毛泽东思想是革命的真理。《毛主席语录》是伟大的中国革命的宝贵经验的结晶。通过阅读这本宝书，我们受到了极大的鼓舞。”
    一位曾经访问过中国的黎巴嫩朋友说：“没有毛泽东，就不会有中国革命的伟大胜利和中国的一切伟大成就。你们拥有原子弹，就是因为你们有毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想比起任何原子弹和核弹都强大。我们同你们一样，以有毛主席这样伟大的领袖而感到非常幸运。”
