Khrushchev Eager to Meet Johnson
Soviet and American Foreign Ministers Hold Secret Talks Again at the United Nations

	New York, June 22 (Xinhua) — Following the public statements by Khrushchev and Johnson indicating a desire for global cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, the foreign ministers of the two countries have held consecutive secret talks. On June 20, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk met directly with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at the United Nations. Later that evening, they had dinner together and engaged in over three hours of secret discussions. Earlier that day, the U.S. State Department announced that Rusk might meet with Khrushchev.

	After the meeting between Rusk and Gromyko, a U.S. official spokesperson announced that they had discussed the Middle East situation and "several other issues of mutual interest" in a "serious" atmosphere. The spokesperson also revealed that they briefly discussed arrangements for a meeting between Johnson and Khrushchev.

	According to Western news agencies, the main topics of Rusk and Gromyko's meeting included the Vietnam issue, nuclear disarmament, and the Middle East situation. This meeting was intended to "lay the groundwork" for a meeting between Johnson and Khrushchev.

	Western news agencies also reported that both Johnson and Khrushchev are "eager" to hold talks, and high-level officials from both governments have been in frequent contact. The veteran American diplomat Averell Harriman has been specifically dispatched to New York to engage in activities. Although Gromyko remains evasive, "most representatives at the United Nations believe that Khrushchev is eager to meet with Johnson."

    柯西金急于求见约翰逊
    苏美两国外长在联合国再次密谈
    新华社二十二日讯　华盛顿消息：在柯西金和约翰逊公开表明苏美要进行全球性大勾结以后，苏美两国外长接连进行秘密会谈。美国国务卿腊斯克同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯二十日在联合国直接进行了会谈，二十一日晚间又在一起共进晚餐，进行了长达三个多小时的密谋。同一天早些时候，美国国务院还宣布，腊斯克可能会见柯西金。
    在腊斯克同葛罗米柯会谈后，美国官方发言人宣布，他们在“认真的”气氛中讨论了中东局势以及“共同感到兴趣的其他若干问题”。这个发言人还透露，他们也“简短地”谈到了安排约翰逊同柯西金会谈的问题。
    据西方通讯社报道，腊斯克同葛罗米柯这次会谈主要内容包括越南问题、“核裁军”问题及中东问题等，这次会谈是为约翰逊同柯西金会谈“奠定基础”。
    西方通讯社还报道说，约翰逊和柯西金都“热衷于”举行会谈，两国政府的高级官员也在就此进行“频繁接触”。美国进行美苏勾结的老手哈里曼已经特地被派到纽约进行活动。尽管葛罗米柯还在闪烁其词，然而联合国的“多数代表都相信，柯西金是急于会见约翰逊的”。
