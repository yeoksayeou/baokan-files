While the head of the Soviet revisionist clique, Kosygin, was in the United States conspiring with the head of American imperialism, Johnson, and preparing to further use the United Nations to tighten the counter-revolutionary global collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States, another head of the Soviet revisionist clique, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Podgorny, arrived in Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic, on the afternoon of June 21 for activities.

After the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist clique was fully exposed in the recent aggression by the United States, Britain, and Israel against Arab countries, they hurriedly demanded an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, putting on a show of "condemning" Israeli aggression and "supporting" Arab countries, attempting to cover up their ugly role as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Podgorny's activities in the United Arab Republic are taking place against this background. According to Western news agencies, Podgorny is expected to assure President Nasser of continued Soviet economic and military aid. This visit was decided before the Soviet revisionist head, Kosygin, left Moscow to attend the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.

On his way to the United Arab Republic, Podgorny specially stopped in Yugoslavia on June 20 to hold talks with the traitor Tito. The Agence France-Presse reported from Belgrade on June 20 that Podgorny had arrived in Yugoslavia, saying that Podgorny would inform Tito of the Soviet revisionists' handling of the Middle East situation. Both sides issued a joint statement after the talks, saying that they held talks in a "friendly and cordial atmosphere" and "exchanged views on the new developments in the Middle East and other issues of common concern."

When Podgorny arrived in Cairo, Nasser and other high-ranking officials of the United Arab Republic went to the airport to welcome him.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Nasser will hold talks with Podgorny on "issues of cooperation between the two countries in the current Middle East conflict." The agency said that a military delegation led by the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy, Zakharov, arrived in Cairo on June 20. Zakharov will participate in the talks between Nasser and Podgorny.

    柯西金在美国同约翰逊勾搭
    波德戈尔内到阿联活动
    新华社二十一日讯　正当苏修领导集团头目柯西金在美国同美帝国主义头子约翰逊勾勾搭搭，准备进一步利用联合国加紧苏美反革命全球性大勾结的时候，苏修领导集团的另一个头子、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内二十一日下午到阿联首都开罗进行活动。
    苏修领导集团在最近美英以侵略阿拉伯国家中出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒面目彻底大暴露后，急急忙忙要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，装出一副“谴责”以色列侵略、“支持”阿拉伯国家的姿态，企图掩盖它充当美帝头号帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。波德戈尔内就是在这个背景下到阿联进行活动的。据西方通讯社透露，波德戈尔内“预料将向纳赛尔总统作出关于苏联继续提供经济和军事援助的保证”，这次“访问”是在苏修头目柯西金“离开莫斯科出席在纽约的联合国大会会议之前决定的”。
    波德戈尔内在去阿联途中，二十日曾特地到南斯拉夫同叛徒铁托举行会谈。法新社二十日从贝尔格莱德报道波德戈尔内到达南斯拉夫的消息时说，波德戈尔内将把苏修对中东局势的做法告诉给铁托。双方在会谈后发表公报说，他们在“友好和亲切的气氛中”举行会谈，“就中东局势的新发展和共同关心的其他问题交换了意见”。
    在波德戈尔内到达开罗时，纳赛尔和阿联其他高级官员到机场欢迎。
    据中东通讯社报道，纳赛尔将同波德戈尔内就“目前中东冲突中两国进行合作的问题”进行会谈。这家通讯社说，以苏联陆海军总参谋长扎哈罗夫为首的一个军事代表团已在二十日到达开罗。扎哈罗夫将参加纳赛尔和波德戈尔内的会谈。
