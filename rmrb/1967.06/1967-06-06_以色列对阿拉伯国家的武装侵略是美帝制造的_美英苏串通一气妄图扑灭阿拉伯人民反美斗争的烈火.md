The U.S. imperialist's tool of aggression in the Middle East, Israel, launched a large-scale air and ground attack on the United Arab Republic (UAR) on the morning of June 5, thus initiating a war of aggression against Arab countries.

This is an aggression that Israel has long planned, and it is a serious crime of aggression against Arab countries orchestrated by U.S. imperialism.

A few days earlier, the U.S. propaganda machine advocated that Israel should take "quick and decisive action" to launch a "surprise attack" on Arab countries. Following this, on June 1, Israel reorganized its cabinet, strengthening its military deployment for aggression. The Israeli military commander, Dayan, who led the invasion of Egypt in 1956, was appointed as the Minister of Defense. Upon taking office, he loudly proclaimed that Israel would "defeat the Arabs." On June 4, the new Israeli cabinet held an emergency meeting. The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. specially brought back a secret letter from Johnson to participate in the cabinet meeting and hurriedly returned to the U.S. the same night. The next day, Israel launched this "surprise attack" on Arab countries. These circumstances clearly indicate that Israel's aggressive actions were entirely manufactured by U.S. imperialism.

Israel is the U.S. imperialist's watchdog in the Middle East

Israel is a watchdog for U.S. imperialism in maintaining its neo-colonialist interests in the Middle East, and it is a tool of aggression for suppressing the national liberation movements of Arab countries. In recent times, with the support and encouragement of U.S. imperialism, the Israeli reactionaries have repeatedly issued war cries to "use force against Syria" and "overthrow the Syrian government." After Syria, the UAR, and other Arab countries mobilized to take self-defense measures against aggression, U.S. imperialism and Israel intensified their collusion, plotting aggression against Arab countries.

Israel, on the one hand, mobilized most of its 110,000 troops, deploying 80,000 of them near the borders of the UAR and Syria, preparing for an attack; on the other hand, it sent its Foreign Minister Eban to the U.S. and other Western countries to seek aid. According to Israeli sources, Eban had "obtained a guarantee of action from the U.S., not just vague support." U.S. imperialism also rushed to deliver military supplies, strengthening Israel's military aggression capabilities.

The U.S. deliberately antagonizes Arab countries

While the Johnson administration was vigorously instigating and supporting Israel to provoke war, it simultaneously applied intense political and military pressure on Arab countries and colluded with the Soviet revisionists and Britain to conspire to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel.

After the UAR government announced the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba to counter Israel's threat of aggression, the Johnson administration immediately applied pressure from all sides on the UAR. On May 23, Johnson issued a statement attacking the UAR's just action of blocking the Gulf of Aqaba to counter Israeli aggression, calling it "illegal" and saying it "could bring disaster to the cause of peace." The next day, according to the Associated Press, the U.S. ambassador to the UAR arrogantly warned the UAR that, "if necessary," the U.S. would "use force to reopen the Gulf of Aqaba." At the same time, Johnson instructed UN Secretary-General U Thant to rush to Cairo, attempting to force the UAR government to change its decision to blockade the Gulf of Aqaba, but this was met with a stern rejection by the UAR.

The Soviet revisionist clique acted as the U.S. imperialist's accomplice

The Soviet revisionist leadership completely played the role of an accomplice to U.S. imperialism on the issue of the Middle East situation. According to Western news agencies, in recent times, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been in frequent secret contacts on the Middle East issue. British newspapers reported that Johnson had sent an "urgent, secret appeal" to the Soviet revisionist leaders, requesting "joint diplomatic action." The U.S. had "received assurances from Russia that it would positively care about maintaining peace."

On the same day Johnson issued his statement, the Soviet revisionist clique also issued a statement of fake support for Arab countries. It did not mention U.S. aggression at all but instead insidiously said that the Soviet Union would "do its utmost to prevent the disruption of peace and security in the Near East." It is noteworthy that after this, the Soviet revisionist clique, whether officially or in the press, avoided expressing positive support for the UAR's just action of blocking the Gulf of Aqaba. It is no wonder that the Associated Press reporter Hansley reported on June 1 that, "despite the Soviet Union's extensive propaganda," U.S. officials felt, after private talks with Moscow, that the Kremlin did not want to go too far as to get involved in direct military action.

At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Brown rushed to the Soviet Union, and the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Thomson, went to the U.S., separately holding secret consultations with the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Middle East situation. Brown said after his talks with the Soviet revisionist leaders on May 26 that his discussions with the Soviet revisionist clique on the Middle East situation were "very thorough, very detailed, extremely friendly, and I think constructive." The British Daily Mirror reported that Brown had obtained a "secret guarantee of assistance in pacifying the Middle East crisis" from the Soviet revisionist clique.

The facts prove that the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Britain are completely in collusion and acting in concert on the Middle East issue, with the common goal of tying the hands of Arab countries in countering Israeli aggression and suppressing the Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle.

Military threats cannot intimidate the Arab people

At the same time, warships from the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union gathered in the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, preparing for armed intervention. The "U.S. Sixth Fleet," specially used to suppress the anti-imperialist struggles of the Asian and African peoples, also intensified its military aggression deployment in the Middle East. On May 30, the commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, Martin, openly boasted that the U.S. would break the UAR's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba and had already drafted a military plan. There were numerous reports from the U.S. and Britain about the U.S. and British plans to organize naval task forces to "escort" Israeli ships to break through the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, openly threatening the UAR with military force. The Soviet revisionist clique not only remained completely silent about the U.S. and British military deployments but also shamefully greeted the U.S. warships when Soviet warships encountered them in the Mediterranean.

On June 2, British Prime Minister Wilson, after talks with Canadian Prime Minister Pearson, rushed to the U.S. to hold secret talks with Johnson on the Middle East situation. According to Western media reports, they "reached an agreement on the need to take emergency steps to resolve the Middle East crisis." These "emergency steps" include using various channels within and outside the United Nations to apply strong political and economic pressure on Arab countries, and even rallying the so-called maritime countries to form an international fleet to escort Israeli ships to forcibly pass through the Gulf of Aqaba, and to force the "United Nations Peacekeeping Forces" to return to the Middle East. It was after this meeting that the Washington Post released the news that the possibility of using force against Arab countries was "increasingly likely." Following this, Israel launched its aggression against Arab countries.

The U.S. imperialist's collusion with the Soviet revisionists and Britain to support Israeli aggression, Arab countries see this clearly. UAR President Nasser recently pointed out, "Without U.S. economic and military aid, Israel could not exist for a single day," "Our enemies are Israel, the U.S., and Britain." However, the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel, cannot intimidate the Arab people. Now, the people of various Arab countries have launched a courageous counterattack. They will not only be able to defeat the Israeli aggressors but will also be able to smash the U.S. and British imperialists' plots of aggression against Arab countries.

### 以色列对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略是美帝制造的  美英苏串通一气妄图扑灭阿拉伯人民反美斗争的烈火

    以色列对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略是美帝制造的
    美英苏串通一气妄图扑灭阿拉伯人民反美斗争的烈火
    美帝国主义在中东的侵略工具以色列，五日上午悍然对阿联进行大规模的空中和地面袭击，从而发动了侵略阿拉伯国家的战争。
    这是以色列蓄谋已久的侵略行动，这是美帝国主义策划制造的侵略阿拉伯国家的一个严重罪行。
    几天之前，美国的宣传机器就鼓吹以色列“采用迅速和果断的行动”，对阿拉伯国家发动“突然袭击”。接着，六月一日，以色列改组内阁，加强了军事侵略部署。曾经在一九五六年指挥入侵埃及的以色列侵略军司令达扬被任命为国防部长。他一上台就狂叫以色列要“打败阿拉伯人”。六月四日，以色列新内阁举行紧急会议。以色列驻美国大使特地从华盛顿带回约翰逊的一封密信参加内阁会议，并于当晚匆匆赶回美国。下一天，以色列就对阿拉伯国家发动了这一场“突然袭击”。这种情况清楚地说明，以色列的这个侵略行动，完全是美帝国主义一手制造的。
    以色列是美帝在中东的看门狗
    以色列是美帝国主义维护它在中东地区新殖民主义利益的一只看门狗，是美帝国主义镇压阿拉伯国家民族解放运动的侵略工具。最近一个时期以来，在美帝国主义的支持和纵容下，以色列反动派不断地发出“要对叙利亚使用武力”、“推翻叙利亚政府”的战争叫嚣。在叙利亚、阿联和其他阿拉伯国家纷纷动员起来，采取反击侵略的自卫措施以后，美帝国主义和以色列更是加紧勾结，策划对阿拉伯国家的侵略阴谋。
    以色列一方面把它全部兵力十一万多人中的八万多人集结到靠近阿联、叙利亚的边境，准备发动进攻；另一方面又派出它的外交部长埃班前往美国和其他西方国家求援。据以色列方面透露，埃班已“得到了美国采取行动的保证，而不是含糊的支持的保证”。美帝国主义还加紧运送军火，加强以色列的军事侵略力量。
      美帝蓄意与阿拉伯国家为敌
    约翰逊政府在竭力怂恿、支持以色列挑起战争的同时，一面对阿拉伯国家疯狂施加政治军事压力，一面又勾结苏修和英国，阴谋扑灭阿拉伯人民反对美帝及其走狗以色列的斗争的烈火。
    在阿联政府为了反击以色列的侵略威胁，宣布封锁亚喀巴湾以后，约翰逊政府马上从各方面对阿联施加压力。五月二十三日，约翰逊发表声明，攻击阿联为了反击以色列侵略而封锁亚喀巴湾的正义行动“是非法的，对和平事业可能带来灾难”。第二天，据合众国际社报道，美国驻阿联大使又狂妄地向阿联提出“警告”说，“如有必要”，美国“将使用武力，使亚喀巴湾开放”。同时，约翰逊还指使联合国秘书长吴丹赶往开罗，企图迫使阿联政府改变封锁亚喀巴湾的决定，但是遭到了阿联的严正拒绝。
      苏修集团充当了美帝的帮凶
    苏修领导集团在中东局势的问题上，完全充当了美帝国主义帮凶的角色。据西方通讯社透露，最近一个时期以来，苏美之间在中东问题上一直在进行频繁的秘密接触。英国报纸报道，约翰逊曾经向苏修头目发出了一个“紧急的、秘密的呼吁”，要求“采取联合外交行动”。而美国“已经接到俄国的保证，表示肯定地关心维护和平”。
    就在约翰逊发表声明这一天，苏修集团也发表了一个对阿拉伯国家假支持的声明。它根本不提美帝侵略，却别有用心地说什么苏联将“竭尽所能防止破坏近东的和平和安全”。值得注意的是，在此以后，苏修集团无论官方或报纸，都对阿联封锁亚喀巴湾的正义行动避免表示肯定的支持。这就难怪美国合众国际社记者汉斯莱六月一日的报道说，“尽管苏联大肆宣传”，“美国官员经同莫斯科举行的私下会谈中感到，克里姆林宫并不想走得很远，以致于卷入直接的军事行动。”
    与此同时，英国外交大臣布朗也赶往苏联，外交国务大臣汤姆森前往美国，分头同苏美就中东局势进行密商。布朗五月二十六日在同苏修头目会谈后满意地说，他同苏修集团就中东局势的讨论是“十分充分、十分详尽、极为友好，而且我认为是建设性的”。英国《每日镜报》报道说，布朗得到了苏修集团“协助平息中东危机的秘密保证”。
    事实证明，美苏英在中东问题上完全是串通一气、联合行动的，其共同的目的是要束缚阿拉伯国家反击以色列侵略的手脚，遏制阿拉伯人民的反美斗争。
      武力威胁吓不倒阿拉伯人民
    同时，美、英、苏的军舰纷纷集结于东地中海和红海一带，摆开一副要进行武装干涉的架式。专门用来镇压亚非人民反帝斗争的“美国进击司令部”也加紧进行对中东的军事侵略部署。美国第六舰队司令马丁在五月三十日公开叫嚷说，美国要破坏阿联对亚喀巴湾的封锁，并且已经拟订了军事计划。从美国和英国传出了大量关于美英策划组织海军特遣队“护送”以色列船只冲破亚喀巴湾封锁的消息，对阿联进行公开的武力威胁。苏修集团对于美英军事部署不但完全保持沉默，而且苏联军舰在地中海上同美舰相遇时还无耻地向美国军舰招呼致意。
    六月二日，英国首相威尔逊在同加拿大总理皮尔逊会谈以后赶到美国，同约翰逊就中东局势进行密谈。据西方报界透露，他们“就需要采取紧急步骤解决中东危机”达成了协议，这些“紧急步骤”包括利用联合国内外各种途径，对阿拉伯国家施加强大的政治、经济压力，甚至纠集所谓海运国家组织国际舰队为强行通过亚喀巴湾的以色列船只护航，并且使“联合国维持和平部队”强行返回中东。正是在这次会谈以后，《华盛顿邮报》放出了对阿拉伯国家使用武力“可能性越来越大”的空气。接着，以色列就发动了对阿拉伯国家的侵略战争。
    美帝国主义勾结苏修和英国支持以色列侵略的这种行动，阿拉伯国家是看得很清楚的。阿联总统纳赛尔最近曾经指出，“没有美国的经济与军事援助，以色列就一天也存在不下去”，“我们的敌人是以色列、美国和英国”。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略吓不倒阿拉伯人民。现在，阿拉伯各国人民已经展开了英勇反击。他们不但一定能够打败以色列侵略者，而且也一定能够粉碎美英帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的侵略阴谋。
