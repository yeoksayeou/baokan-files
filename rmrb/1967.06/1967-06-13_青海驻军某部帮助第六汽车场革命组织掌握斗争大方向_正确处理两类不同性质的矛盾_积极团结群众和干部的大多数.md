The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Qinghai garrison of the People's Liberation Army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly assisted the revolutionary organization "August 18" of the Sixth Automobile Depot of Qinghai Province. They strove to unite the masses and cadres who had been deceived and those who had made mistakes, concentrating their efforts to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This has powerfully promoted the advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After entering the Sixth Automobile Depot, the soldiers and officers of this unit clearly and unambiguously expressed their support for "August 18," using various opportunities to emphasize that the direction of "August 18" has always been correct and pointing out the various errors of the conservative organizations. To help the proletarian revolutionary masses grow stronger, the soldiers and officers first patiently educated the members of "August 18" to correctly handle the masses who had been deceived and the cadres who had made mistakes, enabling them to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and march forward.

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for revolution." The soldiers and officers used Chairman Mao's teachings to guide "August 18" in seriously distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions, uniting the majority of the masses. A part of the masses in this depot, under the deception and manipulation of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, joined the conservative organizations. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the proletarian revolutionary masses did not discriminate against these masses but warmly united and educated them. They pointed out their mistakes and also explained that they too were victims of the reactionary bourgeois line. Through big-character posters, denunciation meetings, and other forms, they launched activities across the entire depot to expose the bitterness of the old society and the harm caused by the reactionary bourgeois line; to discuss Chairman Mao's kindness and the sweetness of the new society; and to express their determination to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Through these activities, they thoroughly exposed the plot of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to use the conservative organizations to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They awakened the deceived masses to recognize the harm of the reactionary bourgeois line, effectively educating and winning over the deceived masses. Some people, who had participated in persecuting the proletarian revolutionary masses, through education, raised their consciousness, recognized their mistakes, and felt very heavy-hearted. The soldiers and officers and the members of "August 18" actively sought them out for heart-to-heart talks, seriously and warmly pointing out: this account must be settled, but it should be settled with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the revisionist elements in this region and department. They encouraged them to expose problems and welcomed them back to the revolutionary ranks. Through arduous and in-depth ideological work, the deeply deceived masses awakened one after another, turning back to the revolutionary side. Many deceived masses, after awakening, requested to join "August 18." "August 18" supported their revolutionary actions. Every time a new batch of members was recruited, they held a welcome meeting for new comrades and conducted initiation ceremonies, giving each person a copy of the "Three Constantly Read Articles," which was a great education for both old and new members and the masses.

For cadres who had made general mistakes or even serious mistakes, the soldiers and officers actively had heart-to-heart talks with them, studied Chairman Mao's relevant statements and the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together, awakened their class consciousness, overcame selfish thoughts, and helped them quickly recognize and correct their mistakes. At the same time, they armed the revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, enabling the revolutionary masses to correctly handle cadres with a class analysis perspective. Many cadres voluntarily examined their mistakes, thoroughly exposed the crimes of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, making revolution together with "August 18," thereby completely isolating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The soldiers and officers of the unit, in their role of supporting the left, regarded cherishing and assisting the revolutionary masses as a great political task. They said, infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the revolutionary masses and turning it into their conscious actions is the greatest and deepest form of love. They assisted the comrades of "August 18" in studying Chairman Mao's relevant works according to their current thoughts, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, making "August 18" more powerful and more respected among the masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the depot presented a thriving and lively scene.

    青海驻军某部帮助第六汽车场革命组织掌握斗争大方向
    正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾
    积极团结群众和干部的大多数
    新华社西宁十日电　人民解放军青海驻军某部指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，满腔热情地帮助青海省第六汽车场的无产阶级革命派组织“八·一八”，争取团结受蒙蔽的群众和犯有错误的干部，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，有力地推动了无产阶级文化大革命向前发展。
    这个部队的指战员进入第六汽车场以后，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地表示支持“八·一八”，利用各种场合大讲“八·一八”的大方向始终是正确的，指出保守组织的种种错误。为了帮助无产阶级革命派的发展壮大，指战员们首先耐心教育“八·一八”成员正确对待受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部，使他们牢牢掌握斗争的大方向阔步前进。
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”指战员们运用毛主席的教导，引导“八·一八”认真区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，团结群众的大多数。这个场一部分群众在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派欺骗和蒙蔽下参加了保守组织。在解放军的帮助下，无产阶级革命派对这部分群众没有歧视，而是满腔热情地团结教育他们。既指出他们的错误，又说明他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。通过大字报、控诉会等形式，在全场范围内展开了大诉旧社会的苦，大诉受资产阶级反动路线的害；大谈毛主席的恩情，大谈新社会的甜；表达永远跟着毛主席闹革命，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心等项活动。通过这些活动，狠揭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派利用保守组织破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋，启发受蒙蔽的群众认识资产阶级反动路线的危害性，有效地教育、争取了受蒙蔽的群众。有的人，曾参与迫害无产阶级革命派的活动，通过教育，觉悟提高了，认识到错误，心情十分沉重。指战员和“八·一八”成员就主动找他们谈心，严肃而热情地指出：这笔账是要算的，但要算在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和本地区、本部门的反革命修正主义分子身上。鼓励他们揭发问题，欢迎他们回到革命队伍中来。通过艰苦深入的思想工作，使受蒙蔽较深的群众纷纷觉醒，大杀“回马枪”。许多受蒙蔽的群众觉悟后，要求参加“八·一八”。“八·一八”对他们的革命行动都及时给以支持。每吸收一批新队员，都召开欢迎新战友大会，举行入队仪式，每人发给一本“老三篇”，对新老队员和群众都是一个很大的教育。
    对于犯有一般错误甚至是犯有严重错误的干部，指战员们一面主动地和他们谈心，一起学习毛主席有关干部的论述和“老三篇”，启发他们的阶级觉悟，克服私心杂念，帮助他们迅速认识错误，改正错误；一面用毛主席的干部政策武装广大革命群众，使革命群众用阶级分析的观点正确对待干部。许多干部纷纷主动检查自己的错误，狠揭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，坚决地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同“八·一八”一起闹革命，从而彻底孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    部队指战员在支左中，把爱护和帮助革命派当作一项伟大的政治任务。他们说，把毛泽东思想灌输到革命群众中去，变成革命群众的自觉行动，就是最大最深的爱。他们帮助“八·一八”的同志针对活思想学习毛主席有关著作，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，使“八·一八”的战斗力更强，在群众中威信更高。全场无产阶级文化大革命出现了一片轰轰烈烈的大好局面。
