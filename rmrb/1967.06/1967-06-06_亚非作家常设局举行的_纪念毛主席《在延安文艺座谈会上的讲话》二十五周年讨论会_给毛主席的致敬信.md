The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau held a symposium to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The symposium sent a letter of tribute to Chairman Mao.

June 6, 1967, 2nd Edition

	We, the revolutionary, progressive, and patriotic writers from Asia, Africa, and other countries around the world, under the initiative of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, gathered in Beijing—the capital of the great red fortress of the world revolution, China—from May 31 to June 5, 1967, to hold a symposium commemorating the 25th anniversary of your "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." We discussed how to apply your great and brilliant work to our struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, the reactionaries of various countries, and the modern revisionism led by the Soviet ruling clique.

	Greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao:

	We, who participated in the symposium, express our belief:

	Your "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has great, epoch-making significance worldwide. Based on revolutionary Marxism-Leninism, it provides the most correct political guidance for revolutionary and progressive literary and artistic workers around the world. In this brilliant work, you brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory. It is the most systematic, complete, and thorough program for the proletarian cultural revolution and the revolutionary literary line of the proletariat. Your great work is the beacon for the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the cultural revolution of the people of the world.

	Our great helmsman, Chairman Mao:

	In your "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," you deeply, systematically, and successfully resolved the great direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	We believe, as you pointed out: "The question of for whom literature and art serve is a fundamental and principled question." Only by clarifying for whom our literary and artistic creations serve, can we fulfill the historical and revolutionary tasks assigned to us by our people and the people of the world. Only in this way can we become cultural warriors fighting shoulder to shoulder with armed warriors, under your correct guidance, directing our pens and guns at the enemies of the people and the revolution—imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries.

	We believe this is the dividing line between proletarian literature and art and bourgeois literature and art. This is the focal point of the struggle between the Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought literary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line.

	Our great teacher, Chairman Mao:

	You taught us that literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and armed people is serving the needs and fundamental interests of the armed struggle of the workers and peasants. We fully recognize that serving the needs and fundamental interests of the armed struggle of the workers and peasants can only be achieved through the political guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly believe in the great truth you taught: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they in turn exert a great influence on politics. Revolutionary literature and art are a part of the entire revolutionary cause, they are cogs and screws." Therefore, we believe that serving the armed struggle of the workers and peasants is serving the political struggle of the workers and peasants. We oppose the counter-revolutionaries and their spokesmen, the Soviet modern revisionists, who conspire to separate literature and art from politics. This is a deception because they are using literature and art to suppress the revolutionary people's struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries. They are implementing a wicked policy against the revolution and the revolutionary people. They shout about "humanitarian" literature and art. In fact, they create inhuman literature and art and bow down to inhuman people and inhuman deeds, just like the counter-revolutionary literary and artistic workers in the Soviet Union. You correctly pointed out: "In class society, there is only class-based humanity, not some super-class humanity." The so-called super-class humanitarianism does not exist. Our own experiences prove that only through armed struggle can the people achieve liberation and overthrow the reactionary rule. This is in line with your teaching of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." We should indeed use our pens to promote armed revolutionary struggle. Our literature and art should become the charcoal and firewood that ignite the flames of armed struggle.

	Our most beloved Chairman Mao:

	According to your instructions on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we revolutionary literary and artistic workers should resolutely stand on the revolutionary political stance of Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically sing the praises of the people, the workers, peasants, and armed people, and their revolutionary struggles; mercilessly expose the ugly faces and crimes of the enemies of the people—imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, starting from this stance, fully create works that awaken the people, the workers, peasants, and armed people to smash their enemies. Our works should make the workers, peasants, and armed people firmly believe that imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries are completely "paper tigers" that can be defeated by the great power of the revolutionary masses. Our works, inspired and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, should become "powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

	Our great leader, Chairman Mao:

	We have seen with our own eyes the great role played by your "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in guiding the current proletarian cultural revolution in China. This great proletarian cultural revolution, which is shaking the world, is uprooting revisionism, overthrowing the reactionaries and the authorities who are taking the capitalist road, thus preventing the restoration of capitalism and ensuring that socialist China, as a stronghold of the world revolution, will never change color. This proletarian cultural revolution has made imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries tremble with fear, but for the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and the world, it is an unprecedentedly inspiring force that arouses their spirit of struggle and rebellion to break the shackles of oppression and exploitation and strive for a bright future.

	We see that the revolutionary literary and artistic workers in China, armed with your "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," have successfully created literary and artistic works such as the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," the opera "The Red Detachment of Women," the opera "The Red Lantern," the symphony "The Battle of Shajing," and the novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai." These works are models of applying Mao Zedong Thought to literary creation. Chairman Mao, you have set an example for us with your poetry.

	In these works, we can clearly see the harmonious combination of literature and art with politics. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, this is the fruit of the proletarian cultural revolution.

	We believe, as you pointed out, to create literature and art that serve the armed workers and peasants, revolutionary literary and artistic workers must wholeheartedly devote themselves to the workers, peasants, and armed masses, learn Mao Zedong Thought and society in the fiery struggle, reform themselves, and gradually shift their stance "to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers." We believe that changing one's worldview is the key to correctly solving the problem of for whom literature and art serve.

	Revolutionary helmsman, Chairman Mao:

	Your literary line is a completely revolutionary line. With this line, you have pointed out the only correct path for the development of revolutionary literature and art. The 25-year history from the birth of your "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to the present has proven that following the direction you indicated will promote the prosperity and development of revolutionary literature and art and the revolutionary literary and artistic movement, making our literary creation a powerful weapon for preparing public opinion and ideology for the revolutionary struggle, striving for national liberation and consolidating revolutionary achievements.

	Through learning Mao Zedong Thought, we express from the bottom of our hearts our deep respect and gratitude to Chairman Mao. When we truly apply your great teachings to our daily work and struggle, this gratitude will be more meaningful.

	Finally, we want to say that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for us to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries. Under the inspiration and guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary literary and artistic movement, especially the Afro-Asian writers' movement, will definitely achieve the sacred goal of serving the revolutionary people and the revolutionary struggle of Asia, Africa, and the world. We place all our hopes in you, Chairman Mao, to lead our revolutionary struggle. We swear to forever learn from you and follow your teachings. We believe that deviating from your teachings will bring failure and darkness; following your teachings will bring success and light.

	Long live the great and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought! May it shine forever!

	Glory to the Communist Party of China! Glory to the Chinese people!

	Long live the great red fortress of the world revolution, the People's Republic of China!

	Long live the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"!

	Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution that is shaking the world!

	Long live the eternal unity of the people of Asia and Africa against imperialism, reactionaries, and revisionism!

	May the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, under the inspiration and guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, advance from victory to victory!

	Long live the great teacher, great helmsman, great leader, great revolutionary, great poet, and the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao! May you live ten thousand years!

    亚非作家常设局举行的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会”
    给毛主席的致敬信我们最敬爱的毛主席：
    我们，亚洲、非洲以及全世界其他国家的革命、进步、爱国的作家，在亚非作家常设局执行书记处的发起下，于一九六七年五月三十一日至六月五日聚集在北京——世界革命伟大红色堡垒中国的首都，举行纪念您的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年的讨论会，讨论了如何把您的这部伟大而光辉的著作活学活用到我们反对以美国为首的帝国主义，各国反动派，苏联统治集团领导下的现代修正主义的斗争中去。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席：
    参加座谈会的我们表示我们的信念：
    您的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》具有伟大的划时代的世界意义。它在革命的马克思列宁主义的基础上给予了全世界革命的进步的文艺工作者以最正确的政治指导。在这部光辉的著作中，您天才地，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的世界观和文艺理论，它是最系统，最完整，最彻底的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领和无产阶级的革命文艺路线。您的这部伟大的著作，是亚非作家运动和全世界人民文化革命的指路明灯。
    我们伟大的舵手毛主席：
    在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，您深刻、系统、成功地解决了文学艺术为工农兵服务的伟大方向问题。
    我们认为，正如您指出的：文艺“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”只有明确了我们创作的文艺是为什么人服务的，我们才能完成本国人民和世界人民赋予我们的历史任务和革命任务。只有这样，我们才能成为与武装战士并肩战斗的文化战士，在您的正确思想指导下，把我们的笔和枪都射向人民的敌人，革命的敌人——帝国主义，现代修正主义和反动派的心脏。
    我们认为，这是无产阶级文艺与资产阶级文艺的分界线。这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想文艺路线与反革命修正主义文艺路线斗争的焦点。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席：
    您教导我们，文艺为工农和人民武装服务，就是为工农和人民武装的斗争需要和根本利益服务。我们充分认识到：为工农和人民武装的斗争需要和根本利益服务，只有通过毛泽东思想鼓舞和指导下的政治，才能得到集中的表现。我们坚信您所教导的“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治。革命文艺是整个革命事业的一部分，是齿轮和螺丝钉”这一伟大真理。因此，我们认为，为工农和人民武装服务，就是为工农和人民武装的政治斗争服务。我们反对反革命分子以及他们的代言人苏联现代修正主义者把文艺与政治割裂开来的阴谋。这是一个骗局，因为他们正在利用文艺压制革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的斗争，他们正在执行一个反对革命和革命人民的罪恶政策。他们大嚷“人道主义”文艺。事实上他们创作非人道的文艺并拜倒在非人道的人们和非人道的行为之下，这就象是苏联反革命文学艺术家所做的。您正确地指出：“在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。”所谓超阶级的人道主义根本就不存在。我们自己的切身体会，证明了只能通过武装斗争才能得到人民的解放和推翻反动统治。这符合您的“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导。我们恰恰应该用我们的笔推动革命武装斗争。我们的文学艺术应该成为燃烧起武装斗争烈火的木炭和柴火。
    我们最敬爱的毛主席：
    根据您的文艺为工农兵服务的指示，我们革命的文学艺术家应该坚决地站在毛泽东思想革命的政治立场上，热情地歌唱人民，歌唱工农和人民武装，歌唱他们的革命斗争；无情地揭露人民敌人——帝国主义，现代修正主义和反动派的丑恶面貌及罪行。革命的文学、艺术家从这个立场出发，充分创作出唤醒人民，唤醒工人、农民和人民武装去粉碎他们的敌人的作品。我们的这些作品应该使工农和人民武装坚信：帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派是完全可以用伟大的革命的人民群众的力量来打败的“纸老虎”。我们这些受到毛泽东思想鼓舞和指导的作品，应该成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席：
    我们亲眼看到了您的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》在指导目前正在中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命方面所起的伟大的作用。这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，正在挖掉修正主义的根子，打倒反动派和走资本主义道路的当权派，这样就能防止资本主义复辟，使作为世界革命强大堡垒的社会主义中国永不变色。这场无产阶级文化大革命已使得帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派发抖、害怕得要死，但对亚非以及全世界革命人民来说它是唤起他们打破被压迫剥削的枷锁和争取光明灿烂前途的斗争精神和造反精神的无比鼓舞力量。
    我们看到，用《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》武装起来的中国的革命文学艺术家，极为成功地创作出象芭蕾舞《白毛女》，《红色娘子军》，京剧《红灯记》，交响乐《沙家浜》以及小说《欧阳海之歌》等文艺作品。这些作品是把毛泽东思想运用到文艺创作中去的样板。毛主席，您用您的诗词，为我们树立了文艺创作的典范。
    在这些作品里，我们可以清楚地看到文艺与政治和谐地结合。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。
    我们认为，正如您所指出的，要创作出为工农和人民武装服务的文艺，革命的文学艺术家必须全身心地投身到工农和人民武装群众中去，在火热的斗争中学习毛泽东思想，学习社会，改造自己，逐渐把立场“移到工农兵这方面来”。我们相信，世界观的改变，是我们正确解决文艺为谁服务的钥匙。
    革命的舵手毛主席：
    您的文艺路线是完全革命的路线，您用这个路线为革命文艺的发展指出了唯一正确的道路。从《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》诞生到现在的二十五年历史，证明了按照您指引的方向去做，就推动革命的文学艺术和革命的文学艺术家运动繁荣发展，使我们的文艺创作成为为革命斗争作舆论准备和思想准备，争取民族解放和巩固革命成果的强大武器。
    我们通过学习毛泽东思想，从心灵深处表示我们对毛主席充满崇敬的感激之情。当我们真正把您的伟大教导运用到我们经常的工作和斗争中时，我们这种感谢才更有意义。
    最后我们想说，毛泽东思想是我们反对帝国主义，现代修正主义和反动派的强大的思想武器。在毛泽东思想的鼓舞和指导下，革命文学艺术家运动，特别是亚非作家运动一定能够达到为亚非以及全世界革命人民和革命斗争服务的神圣目的。我们对您——毛主席，寄予领导我们革命斗争的一切希望。我们宣誓，永远向您学习和遵循您的教导。我们相信，背离您的教导就会带来失败和黑暗；遵循您的教导，就会带来成功和光明。
    伟大、光辉的毛泽东思想万岁！永放光芒！
    光荣归于中国共产党！光荣归于中国人民！
    世界革命的伟大红色堡垒中华人民共和国万岁！
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》万岁！
    震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    亚非人民反对帝国主义、反动派和修正主义的永恒团结万岁！
    祝毛泽东思想鼓舞和指导下的亚非作家常设局从胜利走向胜利！
    伟大的导师，伟大的舵手，伟大的领袖，伟大的革命家，伟大的诗人，世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！
