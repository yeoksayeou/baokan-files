Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the triumphant call of the revolution in Peking Opera, the revolutionary symphonic work *The Red Detachment of Women* has broken through countless obstacles and emerged from the old bastions of bourgeoisie and foreign dead men!

The birth of *The Red Detachment of Women* has pronounced the failure of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, opening up a broad and new path for proletarian symphonic music.

We cheer for the revolutionary symphonic work *The Red Detachment of Women*!

I

The birth of *The Red Detachment of Women* is a great victory for the proletariat in the ideological sphere in their struggle against the bourgeoisie for power!

The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power.

Whichever class holds the leadership in literature and art, that literature and art serves that class. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "What is truly of the people today must be led by the proletariat. What is led by the bourgeoisie cannot belong to the people."

For more than a decade since the founding of the nation, the leadership of the literary and artistic realm has been usurped by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, and Xia Yan. With the support and protection of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, they have promoted a revisionist literary and artistic black line that opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. They have turned the literary and artistic realm into an important stronghold for their attacks on proletarian dictatorship and their attempts to restore capitalism in China.

Under the control of this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, for more than a decade, our symphonic music stage has been filled with the works of foreign bourgeoisie and modern revisionists. Didn't that Chinese Khrushchev say, "Reflecting modern life cannot be forced"? Didn't he say, "Foreign things should be imported in large quantities, and reformist things can also be included"? Thus, those foreign dead men have all come to our socialist China's symphonic music stage to act arrogantly.

Of course, those counter-revolutionary revisionists also created some "national" symphonies, but these "national" symphonies were nothing more than making you cry for the landlord's daughter Qiu Yingtai, cheer for the "loyal ministers and generals" of the "Song Dynasty" like Mu Guiying, or enter the realm of "Spring River and Flower Moon Night," forgetting about class struggle.

These things serve the bourgeoisie and serve the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. This small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, using their power, has seized control of the symphonic music stage!

In 1962, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a great call to the entire Party and the people of the nation: "Never forget class struggle!"

With Comrade Jiang Qing as the representative, the proletarian revolutionaries have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a life-and-death class struggle against a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic realm. They have launched a fierce attack on feudalism, capitalism, and modern revisionist literature and art.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." In a short period, Peking Opera, the most tightly controlled stronghold of bourgeoisie forces, was the first to be breached. The revolutionary comrades of the Central Orchestra, inspired by the revolution in Peking Opera, made a firm decision to create a symphony truly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The symphonic music also began to revolutionize. They followed Comrade Jiang Qing's suggestion to use revolutionary modern Peking Opera as the foundation and began to create *The Red Detachment of Women*.

Those counter-revolutionary revisionists hated the revolution in symphonic music to death. At first, they used their power to obstruct and sabotage the creation of *The Red Detachment of Women*, not providing the creators with the necessary personnel, time, or orchestra rehearsals, attempting to strangle *The Red Detachment of Women* in its cradle.

The revolutionary comrades of the Central Orchestra stood firm against the enemy's harassment and overcame numerous difficulties, completing the draft of *The Red Detachment of Women*.

That small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists saw *The Red Detachment of Women* as a thorn in their side. At this time, they on one hand pieced together and collected opposing opinions, attempting to fundamentally negate it, and on the other hand, they tried to seize the leadership of *The Red Detachment of Women*, then lead it astray, making it degenerate.

However, our revolutionary literary and artistic warriors saw through the enemy's tricks. They firmly held the leadership of creation in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, smashing the plot of this small clique of scoundrels to sabotage the revolutionary symphony *The Red Detachment of Women*.

In September 1965, the first truly proletarian symphony serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in human history was finally born!

Chairman Mao said: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is detached from the people) the people have become dregs, ruled by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring the true face of history. Thus, old drama has opened a new horizon, which is worth celebrating."

The birth of *The Red Detachment of Women* proclaims that those bourgeoisie masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies have been kicked off the symphonic music stage. It opens a new horizon for symphonic music serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Guo Jian'guang, Ah Qing, and Grandma Sha, representing millions of revolutionary heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have taken big strides onto the symphonic music stage.

II

Chairman Mao said: "All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised. This is the basic task of revolutionary literary and artistic workers."

Don't those counter-revolutionary revisionists want to abandon the "revolutionary script" and betray the "path of war"? Don't they want to oppose the "smell of gunpowder"? Our *The Red Detachment of Women* directly confronts them, writing in large letters about revolutionary war, filling the symphonic music stage with the "smell of gunpowder," and praising Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war.

Don't those counter-revolutionary revisionists want us to write only about those "neither good nor bad, both good and bad, mediocre masses"? Our *The Red Detachment of Women* directly confronts them, creating the towering proletarian heroic figures of Guo Jian'guang, Ah Qing, and Grandma Sha.

Don't those counter-revolutionary revisionists want "realism"? In fact, they are using "realism" as a cover to beautify the class enemies and uglify the revolutionary people. Our *The Red Detachment of Women* directly confronts them, praising the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought as not only brave and steadfast, daring to struggle, but also clever, resourceful, and good at struggling. It ruthlessly exposes that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

*The Red Detachment of Women* thus praises the revolutionary struggles of the people and exposes the dark forces harming the people. Its expressed thoughts and created heroic figures are great.

Symphonic music in Europe has a history of several hundred years. In the rising period of the bourgeoisie, their symphonic music reached its peak. Foreign bourgeoisie and modern revisionists consider this an "unreachable peak," and a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in our literary and artistic realm say: "The peak of European music is Mount Everest, and if we can create a Xixabangma, that would be fine." This is pure nonsense! Standing on the peak of our proletarian symphonic music and looking at bourgeoisie things, what peak is it? It is just a small mound.

That "peak" praises the bourgeoisie revolution, which is merely a revolution replacing one exploitative system with another. Can it compare with the people's revolutionary war led by the proletariat that we praise in *The Red Detachment of Women*?

That "peak" beautifies the heroes, who are merely representatives of the bourgeoisie sucking the blood and sweat of millions of laboring people. Can they compare with the proletarian revolutionaries Guo Jian'guang, Ah Qing, and Grandma Sha that we create in *The Red Detachment of Women*?

That "peak" praises the highest ideal, which is merely the reactionary slogan of "freedom, equality, fraternity" used by the bourgeoisie to deceive the people. Can it compare with the ideal we praise in *The Red Detachment of Women*: "Bury all imperialist reactionaries, victory belongs to the revolutionary people"?

"All past glories are gone, the number of heroes is still counted today."

III

*The Red Detachment of Women* is a brilliant model of literary and artistic revolution following Chairman Mao's guidelines of making the past serve the present, making foreign things serve China, and innovating.

We, the proletariat, are the most advanced class in human history, and our literature and art should also be the most brilliant in human history. Therefore, when we create our own literature and art, we should absorb all that is useful from the literary and artistic heritage of human history. "All that is useful to us today should be absorbed. It should be divided into essence and dregs, then discard the dregs and absorb the essence."

Regarding how to absorb these literary and artistic heritages, those capitalist-roaders within the Party are fundamentally different from us.

They, starting from the goal of undermining socialism and restoring capitalism, bring all the things of feudalism, capitalism, and modern revisionism onto our stage. In creation, they also rigidly imitate and copy the things of dead people and foreigners. For more than a decade since liberation, symphonic music has been created according to the old path of foreigners' so-called "pure music," "four movements," and so-called "sonata form structure."

In fact, this kind of thing is hardly understood by many people. Most of the bourgeoisie masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies are also pretending to understand, feigning civilization. Many authors of symphonies do not even prepare for their works to be understood by people. A bourgeoisie musician admitted that this kind of symphonic music "you can think of it this way, or you can think of it that way."

They bring this kind of foreign goods to market and also hold a "Symphonic Music Popularization Month," which, as Chairman Mao described, is "simply the cawing of crows, yet they insist on cawing to the people. The common people do not know what nonsense they are talking, and they blame the common people for having no 'culture.' They say: 'My works can only be appreciated by people fifty years later.' In fact, this is just the thing that Chairman Mao sharply criticized, wanting to 'raise the workers, peasants, and soldiers to the 'height' of the feudal class, bourgeoisie, and petty bourgeoisie intellectuals.'"

In the creation process of *The Red Detachment of Women*, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists tried their best to pull this work towards this path.

They said: "You can't keep doing this! You should create some decent symphonies and concertos." "Your thing is neither a finished product nor a waste product, but a trial product.... In the future, you still have to create 'pure music' things." Someone even said: "If you want it foreign, then be foreign all the way." Lin Moquan more maliciously proposed to "first rely on, then develop." His so-called "first rely on" is to rely on the traditional Peking Opera of feudalism; "then develop" is to develop into the old style of bourgeoisie symphonic music.

The revolutionary comrades of the Central Orchestra firmly fought against this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They knew that to create something truly "needed and easily accepted by the workers, peasants, and soldiers," they must follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "base on the actual needs of the Chinese people and critically absorb foreign culture."

They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, using the Peking Opera music familiar to the Chinese people as the foundation, adding chorus, solo, recitation, and costume performance to the symphonic music. In structure, it follows the development of the story as the thread, completely breaking the framework of foreign symphonic music structure.

The role of the symphony orchestra is also fully utilized here. It not only vividly helps the chorus and solo to shape images and express content but also plays to its strengths in some pure music segments interspersed throughout the plot, expressing specific emotions and images. For example, the "sweeping" segment vividly depicts the brutality of the Japanese invaders and the people's anger. An old worker said: "Listening to this music segment makes me recall the situation of the bandits' sweeping at that time."

Chairman Mao said: "Regarding the literary and artistic forms of the past, we do not reject using them, but these old forms, once in our hands, are transformed, adding new content, thus becoming revolutionary things serving the people."

This is the path our proletarian symphonic music should take. Not only should we in China take this path, but all proletarians in the world developing their own revolutionary national symphonic music art should also take this path. A revolutionary friend from Latin America, after listening to the symphonic music *The Red Detachment of Women*, said: "Take the Chinese path, and there will be national art; take the Western path, and there will be no national art."

"We are doing the extremely glorious and great business that our ancestors have never done.

Our goal must be achieved.

Our goal must be achieved."

Proletarian revolutionary literature and art will bloom under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, blooming across all of China, blooming across the world!

    交响音乐的新生面
    中央音乐学院　毛泽东思想战斗团　红岩兵团
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在京剧革命的胜利号角声中，革命的交响音乐《沙家浜》冲破重重阻力，从资产阶级洋人死人的旧营垒中杀出来了！
      《沙家浜》的诞生，宣判了反革命修正主义文艺路线的破产，为无产阶级的交响音乐开辟了一条广阔的崭新的道路。
    我们为革命的交响音乐《沙家浜》拍手叫好！
                              一
    《沙家浜》的诞生，是在意识形态领域里无产阶级向资产阶级进行夺权斗争的伟大胜利！
    革命的根本问题就是政权问题。
    文艺的领导权掌握在哪个阶级的手里，文艺就为哪一个阶级服务。正象毛主席指出的：“真正人民大众的东西，现在一定是无产阶级领导的。资产阶级领导的东西，不可能属于人民大众。”
    建国十几年来，文艺界的领导权，被周扬、林默涵、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子所篡夺，他们在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持和包庇下，推行了一条同毛主席的革命文艺路线相对抗的修正主义文艺黑线，他们把文艺界当成他们进攻无产阶级专政，在中国复辟资本主义的重要阵地。
    在这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的控制下，十几年来，在我们的交响音乐舞台上充满了外国资产阶级和现代修正主义的东西。那个中国的赫鲁晓夫不是说“反映现代生活不能勉强”吗？不是说“外国的东西要大量进口，改良主义的也可以”吗？于是，那些洋人死人，都跑到我们社会主义中国的交响音乐舞台上来作威作福了。
    当然，那些反革命修正主义分子也搞了一些“民族的”交响乐，但这些“民族的”交响乐，也无非是让你为地主小姐祝英台哭鼻子，为“大宋朝”的“忠臣良将”穆桂英叫好，或者叫你进入“春江花月夜”的境地，忘掉阶级斗争。
    这些东西，是为资产阶级服务，是为地富反坏右服务的。这一小撮反革命修正主义分子利用他们把持着的大权，在交响音乐舞台上专了我们的政！
    一九六二年，在党的八届十中全会上，我们伟大的领袖毛主席向全党和全国人民发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。
    以江青同志为代表的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子展开了一场你死我活的阶级斗争，向封建主义、资本主义和现代修正主义的文艺发动了猛烈的总攻击。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”在很短的时间内，京剧这个资产阶级顽固势力控制最严密的堡垒首先被攻破了。中央乐团的革命的同志们，在京剧革命的鼓舞下，下定决心，要搞出真正为工农兵服务的交响乐来。交响音乐也开始革命了。他们按照江青同志的建议，以革命现代京剧做基础，开始创作《沙家浜》了。
    那些反革命修正主义分子对交响乐的革命恨得要死，他们开始是利用他们手里的权，阻挠和破坏《沙家浜》的创作，不给创作人员，不给创作时间，不给乐队试奏，妄图把《沙家浜》扼死在摇篮里。
    中央乐团的革命的同志们顶住了阶级敌人的刁难，克服了重重困难，完成了《沙家浜》的初稿。
    那一小撮反革命修正主义分子把《沙家浜》看成眼中钉、肉中刺。这时，他们一方面东拼西凑，搜集反对意见，想从根本上否定它，一方面他们又企图把《沙家浜》的领导权揽到自己手里，然后把它引入歧途，使它变质。
    但是，我们的革命文艺战士识破了敌人的诡计，他们把创作的领导权紧紧地掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里，粉碎了这一小撮坏蛋破坏革命交响乐《沙家浜》的阴谋。
    一九六五年九月，人类历史上第一部真正为工农兵服务的无产阶级交响乐终于诞生了！
    毛主席说：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，由此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。”
    《沙家浜》的诞生，宣告了那些资产阶级的老爷太太少爷小姐们从交响音乐的舞台上滚蛋了，它使交响音乐开了为工农兵服务的新生面。郭建光、阿庆嫂、沙奶奶代表着千百万用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命英雄人物大踏步地登上了交响音乐的舞台。
                            二
    毛主席说：“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。”
    那些反革命修正主义分子不是要离“革命经”，叛“战争道”吗？不是要反“火药味”吗？我们的《沙家浜》就针锋相对，大写特写革命战争，让“火药味”充满交响音乐的舞台，歌颂了毛主席的人民战争的光辉思想。
    那些反革命修正主义分子不是要我们专写那些“不好不坏，亦好亦坏，中不溜儿的芸芸众生”吗？我们的《沙家浜》就针锋相对，塑造起了郭建光、阿庆嫂、沙奶奶这些高大的无产阶级英雄形象。
    那些反革命修正主义分子不是要“写真实”吗？其实，他们不过是打着“写真实”的幌子，美化阶级敌人，丑化革命人民。我们的《沙家浜》就针锋相对，歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民不仅勇敢，坚定，敢于斗争，而且机智，多谋，善于斗争。它无情地暴露了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。
    《沙家浜》就是这样歌颂了人民群众的革命斗争，暴露了危害人民的黑暗势力的。它所表现的思想，它所塑造的英雄形象，是伟大的。
    交响乐在欧洲已经有几百年的历史了，在资产阶级的上升时期出现了他们的交响乐高峰。外国的资产阶级和现代修正主义者认为这是“不可企及的高峰”，我国文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子也说：“欧洲音乐的高峰是珠穆朗玛峰，我们能搞个希夏邦马就不错了。”这纯粹是扯淡！站在我们无产阶级交响乐的山峰上看资产阶级的东西，它哪里是什么“高峰”，不过是小土堆而已。
    那个“高峰”所歌颂的资产阶级革命，不过是以一个剥削制度代替另一个剥削制度的革命，它能和我们在《沙家浜》里歌颂的无产阶级领导的人民革命战争相比吗？
    那个“高峰”所美化的英雄，不过是吸吮着千百万劳动人民血汗的资产阶级的代表人物，他们能和我们在《沙家浜》里所塑造的无产阶级的革命者郭建光、阿庆嫂、沙奶奶相比吗？
    那个“高峰”所歌颂的最高理想，不过是“全世界都变成兄弟，大家欢乐地拥抱在一起”这个资产阶级用以欺骗人民的“自由、平等、博爱”的反动口号，它能和我们在《沙家浜》里歌颂的“把帝国主义反动派全埋葬，胜利属于革命人民”这个理想相比吗？
    “俱往矣，数风流人物，还看今朝。”
                            三
    《沙家浜》是按照毛主席关于古为今用，洋为中用，推陈出新的方针进行文艺革命的一个光辉样板。
    我们无产阶级是人类历史上最先进的阶级，我们的文艺也应该是人类历史上最光辉灿烂的文艺。因此，我们在创造自己的文艺的时候，对于人类历史上一切文学艺术遗产，“凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收。”“把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，然后排泄其糟粕，吸收其精华”。
    对于如何吸收这些文学艺术遗产，那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派同我们是根本不同的。
    他们从瓦解社会主义、复辟资本主义的目的出发，把封建主义、资本主义和现代修正主义的东西全盘端上我们的舞台，在创作上也是硬搬和模仿这些死人和外国人的东西。解放十几年来的交响乐，就是按照洋人的一套所谓“纯音乐”、“四乐章”和所谓“奏鸣曲式结构”的老路进行创作的。
    实在，这类东西没有多少人可以听懂，那些资产阶级老爷太太少爷小姐多数也是不懂装懂，假文明。许多交响乐的作者，也根本就不准备使自己的作品被人听懂的。一位资产阶级的音乐家承认，这种交响乐“你如此去想也可，如彼去想也可”。
    他们拿着这类洋货上市，还搞什么“交响乐普及月”，这就象毛主席形容的“简直是老鸦声调，却偏要向人民群众哇哇地叫。”老百姓不知道他在胡言乱语些什么，他还埋怨老百姓“没水平”。他们说：“我的作品要五十年以后的人才能欣赏。”其实，这不过就是毛主席尖锐地批评过的那种要“把工农兵提到封建阶级、资产阶级、小资产阶级知识分子的‘高度’去”的东西。
    在《沙家浜》的创作过程中，一小撮反革命修正主义分子就极力想把这个作品拉向这条道路。
    他们说：“你们这样搞下去不行！应该搞些象样的交响乐、协奏曲。”“你们这个东西既不是成品，也不是废品，而是个试制品。……以后还是要搞成‘纯音乐’的东西。”有人还说：“要洋嘛！就一洋到底。”林默涵更别有用心地提出要“先依靠，后发展”。他的所谓“先依靠”，就是依靠封建主义的传统京剧；“后发展”，就是发展成资产阶级交响乐的老样子。
    中央乐团革命的同志们向这一小撮反革命修正主义分子进行了坚决的斗争。他们知道，要想创造出真正“工农兵自己所需要、所便于接受的东西”，就必须按照毛主席的指示“以中国人民的实际需要为基础，批判地吸收外国文化。”
    他们遵照毛主席的指示，以中国人民熟悉的京剧音乐为基础，在交响音乐里加进了合唱、独唱、朗诵，加进了化装表演。在结构上，它按照故事的发展为线索，完全打碎了洋人的交响乐结构框框。
    交响乐队的作用在这里也得到了充分的发挥，它不仅鲜明地帮助合唱和独唱塑造形象，表达内容，而且也在一些贯穿在整个情节中的纯音乐段落里发挥了它的特长，表现了特定的情绪和形象。例如“扫荡”一段，就形象地刻划了日寇的残暴和人民的愤怒。一位老工人说：“听了这段音乐，使我想起了当时鬼子扫荡的情形。”
    毛主席说：“对于过去时代的文艺形式，我们也并不拒绝利用，但这些旧形式到了我们手里，给了改造，加进了新内容，也就变成革命的为人民服务的东西了。”
    这就是我们无产阶级交响音乐要走的路，不仅我们中国要走这一条路，全世界无产阶级要发展自己革命的民族的交响音乐艺术都要走这一条路。一位拉丁美洲革命朋友在听了交响音乐《沙家浜》以后说：“走中国的路，就有本国的艺术；走西方的路，就没有本国的艺术。”
    “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。”
    无产阶级革命文艺的百花必将在毛泽东思想的哺育下，盛开于全中国，盛开于全世界！
