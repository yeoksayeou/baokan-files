The Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Chahardoh, held a reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the successful conclusion of the fifth plenary session of the Association's Secretariat.

The reception was filled with a revolutionary and united atmosphere. The Chinese and foreign friends attending, along with the representatives from various countries who participated in the fifth plenary session of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat, repeatedly raised their glasses to toast the success of the meeting, which was held under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their heartfelt congratulations and wished the Asian and African peoples and journalists continued victories in their struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Chahardoh solemnly announced in his speech that the fifth plenary session of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat had successfully adopted a new revolutionary line as the basis for the Association's activities. This line is to take Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding principle, and all our activities will be conducted according to Mao Zedong Thought.

Chahardoh said, "Mao Zedong Thought summarizes the experiences of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought guides the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China."

Chahardoh reviewed the development of the revolutionary line of the Asian-African Journalists' Association since its first conference. He said that through continuous struggles, the Association has gradually clarified its program and revolutionary line to oppose imperialism led by the United States and to oppose Soviet modern revisionism, which is the main accomplice of U.S. imperialism. He said that a small group of reactionaries oppose us, but we believe that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing. We will resolutely advance together with the revolutionary peoples of the world, and victory will surely be ours.

Vice Chairman Mu Xin and Tang Pingzhuo of the All-China Journalists' Association attended the reception. Mu Xin said in his speech, "The fifth plenary session of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat is a meeting held under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The general report and resolutions adopted at the meeting are a powerful blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and a great encouragement and inspiration to the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa."

He said, "The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association has taken Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and powerful ideological weapon for the Asian and African peoples and journalists in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary struggles. This has brought the progressive movement of journalists to a new stage and laid a solid political and organizational foundation for the second Asian-African Journalists' Conference."

Mu Xin said when talking about the second Asian-African Journalists' Conference to be held in China, "We are very happy to take on the honorable responsibility of being the host and will actively work to ensure the successful convening of the second Asian-African Journalists' Conference in China."

Invited to attend the reception were responsible persons from various relevant sectors in China and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Also in attendance were the Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of the Asian-African Writers' Association, Senanayake, and anti-imperialist revolutionary fighters and international friends from various countries in Beijing.

As the reception came to an end, Chinese and foreign friends sang "The East Is Red" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
