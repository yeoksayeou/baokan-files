Mao Zedong's good soldier, Lü Xiangbi, sacrificed his life to protect the safety of the Red Guards. His lofty image as a communist warrior, like that of Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and others, will forever live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, forever inspiring and encouraging them.

The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has nurtured millions of young people under the great thought of Mao Zedong, guided by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and tempered in the storms of class struggle, rapidly growing into a new generation of communists. Lü Xiangbi is a prominent representative of this new generation.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "To consolidate the socialist system, both economically and politically, we must advocate the idea of serving the public, that is, to shape new people to build a new society, to shape people with communist spirit." "Such people are what Chairman Mao calls those who are fully and thoroughly dedicated to the people." Therefore, Comrade Lin Biao calls on us: "We must establish the authority of the proletariat, establish the new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. In a word, we must establish the authority of Mao Zedong Thought."

In the struggle, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, eliminating bourgeois ideas and promoting proletarian ones, and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, this is precisely why Lü Xiangbi, in just over a year since enlisting, rapidly grew into a communist warrior. He was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. His lofty thoughts and actions set an example for us in establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

To establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we must establish the authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and establish the authority of the proletarian worldview taught by Chairman Mao, which is fully and thoroughly dedicated to the people. This is a matter of the utmost importance in determining whether each of us is revolutionary or not; it is a matter of the utmost importance in determining whether our country will change color or not; and it is also a matter of the utmost importance in relation to the future of the world revolution. Just as Lü Xiangbi said: Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Lü Xiangbi; without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China; without Chairman Mao, there would be no red new world. Every revolutionary comrade must, like Lü Xiangbi, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The invincible great thought of Mao Zedong is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our time, and the most powerful weapon to defeat all old ideas. Only by establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought can we thoroughly eliminate the ideological basis for the restoration of capitalism and use the proletarian worldview to transform the world. The overthrown bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, in order to seize back the power they have lost and restore the capitalist system, will inevitably launch a fierce attack on Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to establish the authority of bourgeois thought and counter-revolutionary revisionism, and use the bourgeois worldview to transform the world. For a long time, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has been continuously using his poisonous weeds like "Self-Cultivation" to spread the rotten bourgeois individualism, the reactionary bourgeois idealist philosophy, the theory of the extinction of class struggle, the theory of class reconciliation, and other revisionist thoughts, launching a fierce attack on the great thought of Mao Zedong, paving the way for his conspiracy to restore capitalism. It is precisely because we have Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the hundreds of millions of people armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong that we have thoroughly exposed his conspiracy and achieved great victory in our proletarian cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." In the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, our minds will often be invaded by bourgeois ideas. It is either the proletarian ideas overcoming the bourgeois ideas or the bourgeois ideas overcoming the proletarian ideas, there is no middle ground. Therefore, we must, like Lü Xiangbi, consciously establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, constantly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideas, repel the attacks of bourgeois ideas, and always firmly follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, following Chairman Mao on the socialist path.

Under the impetus of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the whole country has launched a new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the masses, and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong has been more widely and deeply spread among hundreds of millions of people. In this favorable situation, every revolutionary must redouble their efforts to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds.

### 大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威

    大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    毛主席的好战士吕祥璧，为保卫红卫兵的安全，英勇地献出了自己的生命。他崇高的共产主义战士的英雄形象，象雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥等同志一样，永远活在亿万人民的心里，永远激励和鼓舞着亿万人民。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，使亿万青年，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在阶级斗争的大风浪中，迅速成长为共产主义一代新人。吕祥璧同志就是这一代新人的突出代表之一。
    林彪同志说：“我们要巩固社会主义制度，经济上的制度，政治上的制度，就必须提倡为公的观念，就是要塑造新的人来建设新的社会，塑造共产主义精神的人。”“这种人是毛主席所说的全心全意为人民的，完全彻底为人民的人。”因此，林彪同志号召：“我们要大立无产阶级的权威，要大立无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。”
    在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，灭资兴无，破私立公，在头脑里树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威，这正是吕祥璧同志所以能够在入伍后短短一年多的时间里，迅速地成长为共产主义战士的最根本的原因。他无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他的崇高的思想和言行，为我们作出了树立毛泽东思想绝对权威的榜样。
    在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，就要树立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的权威，就要树立毛主席教导我们的全心全意、完全彻底为人民的无产阶级世界观的权威。这是决定着我们每个人是革命还是不革命的头等大事；是决定着我们国家变不变颜色的头等大事；也是关系到世界革命前途的头等大事。正象吕祥璧同志所说：有了毛主席，才有我吕祥璧；有了毛主席，才有新中国；有了毛主席，才能有红彤彤的新世界。我们每个革命同志，都要象吕祥璧那样，在自己的头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是战胜一切旧思想的最锐利的武器。只有大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，才能把产生资本主义复辟的思想基础，彻底地扫除，用无产阶级世界观来改造世界。而被推翻了的资产阶级和其他剥削阶级，为了夺回失去的政权，恢复资本主义制度，也必然要竭力向毛泽东思想进行猖狂的进攻，妄图树立资产阶级思想、反革命修正主义的权威，用资产阶级世界观来改造世界。长期以来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是不断地用其《修养》等毒草，大肆宣扬腐朽的资产阶级个人主义，宣扬反动的资产阶级唯心哲学，宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论、阶级调和论等等修正主义思想，向伟大的毛泽东思想进行猖狂的进攻，来为他复辟资本主义的阴谋鸣锣开道。正是由于我们有毛主席的英明领导，有用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了的亿万人民，才彻底地揭穿了他的阴谋，才使我们的无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”在两个阶级的你死我活的大搏斗中，我们的头脑，会经常遭受资产阶级思想的侵袭，不是无产阶级思想克服资产阶级思想，就是资产阶级思想克服无产阶级思想，中间道路是决然没有的。所以，我们必须象吕祥璧同志那样，自觉地在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，不断地肃清资产阶级思想的影响，打退资产阶级思想的进攻，使自己永远坚定地紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席走社会主义的道路。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，全国已经掀起了一个群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加广泛地深入亿万群众。在这样大好的形势下，每一个革命者，都必须再接再厉，在自己头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
                            （五月三十一日）
