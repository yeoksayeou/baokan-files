Khrushchev's Traitor Logic

The head of the Soviet revisionist clique, Khrushchev, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting, extensively propagated the so-called "necessity of preventing war disasters," claiming that even "small incidents" could escalate into large-scale military conflicts, and that if a new world war were to break out, it would inevitably be a "devastating" nuclear war.

Khrushchev's rhetoric is nothing new; it is merely the stale, old junk of the late Khrushchev. Why is he now picking it up and shouting it out? The reason is clear. Khrushchev wants to use this to defend the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the Arab people at a critical moment when U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel are invading Arab countries. Khrushchev wants the Arab people and the people of the world to believe that the Soviet revisionist clique's failure to support the Arab people in their fight against the aggressors is to avoid a nuclear war, to prevent the Arab people from being "destroyed" in such a war. In other words, the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the Arab people is out of good intentions to protect them. This is sheer traitor logic!

Not only that, Khrushchev also wants to use this line to create a theoretical basis for the Soviet revisionist clique's further betrayal. Khrushchev wants the Arab people and the people of the world to believe that the Soviet revisionist clique is now using the interests of the Arab people and the people of the world to make deals with U.S. imperialism to prevent the outbreak of a "devastating" nuclear war and to eliminate the "source of war." In other words, to avoid the world being "destroyed," not only should the Arab people endure humiliation and submit to the manipulations of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, but the Vietnamese people and the people of other countries should also wholeheartedly support their global deals. This is even more sheer traitor logic!

Khrushchev's "nuclear destruction" theory is actually in collusion with U.S. imperialism, engaging in shameless nuclear blackmail against the Arab people and the people of the world. According to Khrushchev's argument, all peoples who have not yet gained independence must endure the oppression and slavery of imperialism and colonialism. Anyone who takes up arms to engage in revolutionary armed struggle faces the danger of being destroyed by the nuclear weapons of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists. All peoples who have already gained independence must not resist the aggression of imperialism and its lackeys. Anyone who rises up to wage an anti-aggression war also faces the danger of being destroyed by the nuclear weapons of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists. What is this if not thorough and complete nuclear blackmail?

However, Khrushchev and his ilk are dreaming in broad daylight. Your and U.S. imperialism's nuclear monopoly have long been bankrupt. In the days when the U.S. and the Soviet Union maintained nuclear monopoly, the peoples of many countries were not frightened by your nuclear weapons and rose up in revolution, achieving one victory after another. Now that the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists has been broken, Khrushchev actually wants to brandish nuclear weapons to intimidate the peoples of the world revolution. Isn't this utterly foolish?

Khrushchev's rhetoric is a mixture of deception and intimidation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialism's threats." The same applies to modern revisionism. The revolutionary peoples of the world are increasingly understanding this truth. No matter how much Khrushchev talks big and puts on a show, he cannot fool anyone. The peoples of various countries will rely on their own strength to wage unyielding struggles and thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    柯西金的叛徒逻辑	 本报评论员
    苏修集团头目柯西金在联合国大会紧急会议上的演说中，大肆宣传所谓“防止战争灾难的必要性”，胡说什么“不大的事件”“都可能转为大规模的军事冲突”，而“新的世界战争一旦爆发，就不可避免是一场”“毁灭性”的核战争。
    柯西金的这一套，并不是什么新鲜玩意儿，而是早已发霉的赫鲁晓夫的破烂货。他现在把它重新捡起来，高声叫卖，是何缘故呢？
    事情很清楚，柯西金是想借此来为苏修集团在美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的紧要关头出卖阿拉伯人民的罪行辩护。柯西金要阿拉伯人民和全世界人民相信，苏修集团之所以不支持阿拉伯人民抗击侵略者，是为了避免爆发一场核战争，避免使阿拉伯人民在这样一场核战争中遭到“毁灭”。这就是说，苏修集团出卖阿拉伯人民，竟是出于保护阿拉伯人民的一片好心的。这是地地道道的叛徒逻辑！
    不但这样，柯西金还想用这一套来为苏修集团正在进行的进一步叛卖勾当制造理论根据。柯西金要阿拉伯人民和全世界人民相信，苏修集团现在拿着阿拉伯人民和世界人民的利益，同美帝国主义大搞交易，是为了防止爆发“毁灭性”的核战争，是为了消灭“战争策源地”。这就是说，为了避免世界遭到“毁灭”，不仅阿拉伯人民应当忍辱负重，乖乖地听从美帝国主义和苏修集团的摆布，越南人民，以及其他各国人民也该双手拥护他们的全球性交易。这更是地地道道的叛徒逻辑！
    柯西金的“核毁灭”论，实际上也就是在配合美帝国主义，对阿拉伯人民和全世界人民进行无耻的核讹诈。按照柯西金的论调，一切还没有取得独立的各国人民，必须忍受帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫和奴役。谁要是拿起武器进行革命的武装斗争，就有毁灭于美帝苏修手上的核武器的危险。一切已经取得独立的各国人民，不得抵抗帝国主义及其走狗的侵略。谁要是起来进行反侵略的战争，也就有毁灭于美帝苏修手上的核武器的危险。这不是彻头彻尾的核讹诈是什么？
    但是，柯西金之流是在白日做梦。你们和美帝国主义的核垄断，都早已破产了。在美苏两个核霸王保持核垄断的年代，许多国家的人民就没有被你们的核武器吓倒，照样起来革命，并取得了一个又一个的胜利。现在，美帝、苏修的核垄断已经被打破，柯西金居然还要挥舞核武器，来恫吓世界革命的人民，这不是愚蠢透顶吗？
    柯西金的这一套，是欺骗和恐吓的混和物。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”对待帝国主义是这样，对待现代修正主义也是这样。全世界革命人民已经越来越懂得这个道理。不管柯西金怎样讲大话，装鬼脸，都唬不了人。各国人民将依靠自己的力量，进行不屈不挠的斗争，彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗。
