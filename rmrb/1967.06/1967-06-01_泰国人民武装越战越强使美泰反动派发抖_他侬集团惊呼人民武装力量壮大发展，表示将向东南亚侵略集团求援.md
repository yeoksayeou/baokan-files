The Thai people's armed forces have recently been actively engaging in guerrilla warfare, delivering heavy blows to the U.S. imperialist invaders and their lackeys, the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique.

According to "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station, preliminary statistics show that in the first 21 days of May, the people's armed forces clashed with American invaders and the reactionary military and police of the Thanom-Baibo clique 30 times. The people's armed forces surrounded eight villages, conducted propaganda among the local people, and exposed the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's invasion of Thailand and the Thanom-Baibo clique's treasonous acts. In these battles, the people's armed forces annihilated a large number of enemies, including killing one American invader.

In the village of Lang Hin in Nakhon Phanom Province, the people's armed forces recently annihilated 87 U.S.-Thai reactionary soldiers and police in an anti-"encirclement" battle.

According to another report from "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the Meo people in Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand recently ignited the flames of armed struggle, strongly supporting the armed struggles of other regions and setting a brilliant example for the struggle of ethnic minorities for complete liberation.

The report said that from May 8 to 11, the armed forces of the people in Tho District, Chiang Rai Province, ambushed the enemy six times, attacked an enemy stronghold once, killing and wounding many enemies, and capturing three alive.

On May 8, the Thanom-Baibo traitorous clique sent 60 armed police and local officials to the village of Chon Pu to suppress the Meo people. The Meo people's armed forces ambushed these reactionaries about 100 meters outside Chon Pu village, killing and wounding many police and officials, and capturing three alive.

On May 9, the Thanom-Baibo clique dispatched helicopters carrying 40 police to reinforce, with the governor of Chiang Rai Province and local police chiefs personally directing the operation. However, they were again met with a head-on attack by the Meo people's armed forces. After more than two hours of intense battle, the enemy was routed.

The increasingly defeated Thanom-Baibo clique, unwilling to accept its failures, frantically dispatched more reactionary police to suppress the people and established a "command center" in the village to suppress the people. The Meo people's armed forces, fearless of violence, continued to strike the enemy and attacked the enemy's "command center."

"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station said that with the strong support of the people nationwide, the Thai people's armed struggle will continue to develop and grow stronger, and no force can stop it.

The rapid development of the Thai people's armed struggle has made the Thanom traitorous clique panic-stricken and become a startled bird. According to reports, the Thanom clique, when sending troops to "suppress" the people's armed forces in the east, is afraid of being attacked and dares not operate in small units. Instead, it often uses tanks and aircraft to cover thousands of infantry in tentative "searches." Even so, they often suffer significant casualties.

According to the Associated Press, Thai reactionary government Vice Premier and Defense Minister Praphas Charusathien recently admitted that there are already thousands of people's armed forces in northeastern Thailand, while the number of people nationwide supporting the people's armed forces has reached several million. To intensify the suppression of the people's armed struggle, Praphas said he would seek aid from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization controlled by the United States to obtain weapons, ammunition, aircraft, ships, and other equipment to strengthen the Thai reactionary military and police. This shows that the Thai reactionaries are increasingly unable to rely on their own strength to deal with the growing and developing Thai people's armed forces.

    泰国人民武装越战越强使美泰反动派发抖
    他侬集团惊呼人民武装力量壮大发展，表示将向东南亚侵略集团求援
    本报讯　泰国人民武装最近积极展开游击战，给了美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗他侬集团沉重的打击。
    据“泰国人民之声”电台报道，据不完全统计，在今年五月份的头二十一天里，人民武装同美国侵略者和他侬—巴博集团的反动军警交锋三十一次。人民武装八次包围村庄，向当地群众进行宣传，揭露美帝国主义侵略泰国和他侬—巴博集团卖国的滔天罪行。人民武装在这些战斗中歼灭了一大批敌人，包括打死一名美国侵略者。
    在那空拍侬府廊希南村，人民武装不久前还在一次反“围剿”战斗中歼灭了美泰反动军警八十七人。
    另据“泰国人民之声”电台报道，泰国北部清莱府苗族人民最近在泰国北部点燃起新的武装斗争的火种，有力地支援了其他地区人民的武装斗争，并为少数民族人民争取彻底解放树立了光辉榜样。
    报道说，清莱府廷县人民武装力量从五月八日到十一日共伏击敌人六次，袭击敌人据点一次，打死打伤敌人多人，活捉三人。
    五月八日，他侬—巴博卖国集团派遣六十名武装警察和地方官员前往春蒲村，企图镇压苗族人民。苗族人民武装力量埋伏在春蒲村外面约一百米的地方，痛击这些反动家伙，打死打伤警察和官员多人，活捉三人。
    五月九日，他侬—巴博集团又出动直升飞机运载四十名警察前往增援，并由清莱府府尹和地方警察头目亲自指挥。但是，他们再次遭到苗族人民武装力量的迎头打击。经过两个多小时激战，敌人被打得落花流水。
    越败越惨的他侬—巴博集团，不甘心于它的失败，又疯狂地增派反动警察前往镇压，并在村里设立镇压人民的“指挥部”。苗族人民武装力量不畏强暴，再接再厉地打击了敌人，并袭击了敌人的“指挥部”。
    “泰国人民之声”电台说，泰国人民武装斗争在全国人民的大力支持下，将日益发展壮大，这是任何力量都阻挡不了的。
    泰国人民武装斗争的迅速发展，已使他侬卖国集团惊慌失措，成为惊弓之鸟。据报道，现在他侬集团在东部出兵“围剿”人民武装时，由于害怕遭到袭击，不敢以小股部队进行活动，往往以坦克飞机掩护成千步兵进行试探“搜索”。即使如此，也常常会遭到不小的伤亡。
    据美联社报道，泰国反动政府的副总理兼国防部长巴博最近承认，泰国东北部的人民武装已有成千人，而全国支持人民武装的群众则达数百万人。为了加紧镇压人民武装斗争，巴博表示将向美国控制下的东南亚条约集团求援，以便得到武器、弹药、飞机、船只和其他装备来加强泰国的反动军警。这就表明，泰国反动派是越来越无法依靠它自己的力量来对付日益壮大发展的泰国人民武装了。
