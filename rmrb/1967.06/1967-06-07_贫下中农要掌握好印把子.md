After studying the "Notice" personally drafted by our dearest and most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, and reflecting on the great practice of the Cultural Revolution in our country over the past year, we poor and lower-middle peasants cannot help but shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: "Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer!" It is he who has given us the theory, line, policy, and guidelines for the Cultural Revolution, and it is he who has personally initiated and led this unprecedented Cultural Revolution. The great victories achieved by the people of our country in this great revolution are the triumph of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

Through studying this "Notice," we have further understood that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the central issue of class struggle is still the question of power, that is, the proletariat must consolidate its power, while the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. In this life-and-death struggle, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are precisely our main targets of revolution. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The struggles of the past year have proven how correct and wise Chairman Mao's teachings are!

The greatest victory of the Cultural Revolution in our country over the past year is that we have exposed the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and we have exposed the Khrushchev of China who has been sleeping beside us. This is a matter of great significance for the future generations of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants!

In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered cruel oppression and exploitation from the landlords and rich peasants. Whenever we think of the past, deep hatred wells up in our hearts. Take our village of Nan Gao as an example: more than 70% of the land was seized by the landlords and rich peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants worked for the landlords for a year, but in the end, they couldn't even afford clothes to wear. How many people were oppressed by them to the point of family separation and ruin! At that time, in the eyes of the landlords, the poor and lower-middle peasants were not even as valuable as a dog in their household!

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the workers and peasants rose up in revolution, overthrowing the three great mountains that had been weighing us down, seizing the seal of power, and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

The Khrushchev of China is determined to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, allowing the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists to ride roughshod over the laboring people once again. Ten years ago, he shouted: "The landlords are gone, and the capitalists are just a few remnants," "The organs of state dictatorship can be reduced," and so on. His reactionary fallacies show that he is indeed an agent of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will never be fooled by him! In this Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards have exposed countless shocking plots of restoration by the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Just take our village as an example: the Red Guard cadres exposed a landlord's plot to change the regime. He photographed the land deeds, wrote a book of regime change, and hid them along with Nationalist Party identity cards, pictures with the Nationalist Party flag, and US dollars from the Nationalist Party rule period until now. Even more seriously, he planned to assassinate our cadres. We held an exhibition with his evidence, which is a resounding slap in the face of the Khrushchev of China!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the Khrushchev of China advocates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle" and opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, the more we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and the more we must never forget class struggle and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat!

    贫下中农要掌握好印把子

    学习了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》，回想一年来我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，我们贫下中农不禁要一千遍一万遍地高呼：“爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲！”是他老人家给我们提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，又是他老人家亲自发动和领导了这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。我国人民在这场伟大的革命中所取得的伟大胜利，就是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们学习了这个《通知》，进一步懂得了在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争的中心问题仍然是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，资产阶级则要推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。在这一场你死我活的斗争中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派正是我们革命的主要对象。毛主席指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”一年来的斗争实践，证明了毛主席的这一教导是多么正确、英明啊！
    一年来，我国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的最大胜利，就是揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把睡在我们身旁的中国的赫鲁晓夫揪了出来。这是关系到广大贫下中农子孙万代的大事！
    在旧社会，我们贫下中农受尽了地主、富农残酷的压迫和剥削。一提起过去，深仇大恨就会涌上心来。拿我们南皋村来说，百分之七十以上的土地都被地主、富农霸占了去。贫下中农给地主扛一年活，到头来连遮身的衣裳也穿不上。有多少人被他们压榨得妻离子散、家破人亡啊！那时，在地主眼里，贫下中农简直不如他家里的一条狗！
    在毛主席领导下，工农群众起来闹革命，才推翻了压在我们身上的三座大山，掌握了印把子，建立起无产阶级专政。有了政权，就有了一切；没有政权，就丧失一切。无产阶级专政是我们贫下中农的命根子。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫一心要推翻无产阶级专政，建立资产阶级专政，使地主、富农、资本家重新骑在劳动人民头上。他在十年前就叫嚷：“地主没有了，资本家也剩下一点尾巴了”，“国家专政的机构可以缩小了”，等等。他这些反动谬论，说明了他的确是地主、资产阶级的代理人，我们贫下中农是决不会上他的当的！在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，揭露了地、富、反、坏、右多少令人触目惊心的阴谋复辟的罪行。就拿我们村来说，红卫兵小将就揭露出一个地主妄图变天的阴谋。他把地契拍成照片，写下一本变天账，连同国民党统治时期的身分证、印有国民党旗的图片以及美金等等，一直隐藏到现在。更严重的是，他还策划暗杀咱们的干部。我们用他的这些罪证举办了个展览会，这是对中国的赫鲁晓夫的一记响亮的耳光！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国的赫鲁晓夫越是宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，越是反对无产阶级专政，我们就越要提高革命警惕，越要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政！
