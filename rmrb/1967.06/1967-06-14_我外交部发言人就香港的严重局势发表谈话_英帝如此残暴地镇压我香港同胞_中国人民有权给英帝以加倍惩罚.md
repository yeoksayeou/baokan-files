The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China made a statement on June 13 regarding the new crimes committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong on June 8 and 9, where they brutally suppressed Chinese compatriots. The spokesperson issued a serious warning to the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong. The statement is as follows:

The British authorities in Hong Kong once again carried out a new wave of fascist suppression against Chinese compatriots on June 8 and 9. The scale and brutality of this suppression exceeded the previous incidents on May 6, 11, and 22. During this new wave of suppression, the British authorities in Hong Kong once again deployed large numbers of military police and "riot control teams," using tear gas and poisonous gas. They savagely beat Chinese compatriots. According to reports, at least two people were beaten to death, dozens were seriously injured, and over five hundred were arrested, resulting in a serious bloodshed. What is even more intolerable is that the British authorities in Hong Kong, in a premeditated attack on the Silver Theatre in Kowloon, viciously smashed the statue of our great leader Chairman Mao and tore down posters and big-character posters promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This is a serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people. We strongly protest against the British government.

Before this new wave of fascist suppression, the British authorities in Hong Kong, in order to intensify their persecution of our patriotic compatriots, made a series of evil arrangements. They issued a series of so-called "emergency decrees" in an attempt to create a "legal basis" for their fascist atrocities. They used tactics such as demotion, dismissal, beating, arrest, kidnapping, sentencing, and deportation to intimidate our patriotic compatriots, attempting to extinguish the great anti-imperialist flames burning in the hearts of Hong Kong compatriots. They brought in several old warships to conduct exercises at the doorstep of our country, provoking the Chinese people. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong appear fierce but are actually terrified. The British imperialists have discovered that they are sitting on a volcano of patriotic anti-imperialist struggles in Hong Kong! Therefore, they are panic-stricken, struggling desperately, and acting like mad dogs, biting and attacking indiscriminately, and suppressing ruthlessly, fully exposing the paper tiger nature of British imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that "all the oppression inflicted on the revolutionary people by the reactionaries of all countries will, in the long run, only serve to promote the more extensive and more violent revolution of the people." The British imperialists, blinded by greed and stupidity, have completely misjudged the situation. The Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, with a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, cannot tolerate the bullying and oppression of imperialism. The seven hundred million great Chinese people, who are in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, cannot stand idly by. Now, the Hong Kong Chinese compatriots have taken further action, and a magnificent revolutionary mass movement is sweeping through Hong Kong and Kowloon. The revolutionary masses' struggle is surging, fiercely striking at the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong patriotic compatriots, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and backed by a great motherland, are united in their hatred of the enemy and their fighting spirit is soaring. They are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, launching a larger-scale counterattack against British imperialism, smashing the reactionary rule of British imperialism to smithereens, and throwing it into the dustbin of history. The great people of the motherland are also fully prepared to support the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots with actual actions until the struggle achieves complete victory.

On May 15, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement, lodging the strongest protest and making five serious demands to the British government. However, the British government has not only refused to admit its crimes but has instead intensified its suppression. We must seriously warn the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong that the current situation in Hong Kong is entirely of your own making. Chairman Mao said: "If someone does not offend me, I will not offend them; if someone offends me, I will offend them." Since you have brutally and bloodily suppressed our Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, pushing the situation to a very serious level, then the Chinese people and the Hong Kong Chinese compatriots have the right to give you a fierce counterattack and a double punishment.

The heinous crimes of British imperialism must be settled. The blood debts of British imperialism must be repaid. The days of British imperialism's arbitrary rule in Hong Kong must end. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong will be victorious! The Chinese people will be victorious! British imperialism will be defeated!

    我外交部发言人就香港的严重局势发表谈话
    英帝如此残暴地镇压我香港同胞
    中国人民有权给英帝以加倍惩罚
    新华社十三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人六月十三日就香港英国当局于六月八、九两日血腥镇压中国同胞的新罪行，对英国政府和香港英国当局提出严重警告。外交部发言人谈话如下：
    香港英国当局在六月八日和九日又对香港中国同胞进行了新的法西斯镇压，其规模之大，手段之残暴，超过了五月六日、十一日和二十二日的几次迫害事件。在这次新的镇压中，香港英国当局再一次出动了大批军警和“防暴队”，使用了催泪弹和毒瓦斯，野蛮毒打中国同胞，据查，至少已有两人惨遭打死，重伤了几十人，逮捕了五百多人，造成了严重的流血惨案。更加令人不能容忍的是，香港英国当局在对九龙银都戏院的一次事先策划的袭击中，竟然丧心病狂地打碎了我们最伟大领袖毛主席的塑像，撕毁了宣传毛泽东思想的图片和大字报。这是对七亿中国人民的严重的政治挑衅。我们向英国政府提出最严重最强烈的抗议。
    在这次新的法西斯镇压之前，香港英国当局为了加紧迫害我爱国同胞，进行了一系列的罪恶部署。它颁布了一连串的所谓“紧急法令”，妄图为它的法西斯暴行制造什么“法律根据”。它用停职、解雇、殴打、逮捕、绑架、判刑、递解出境等卑劣手法来恫吓我爱国同胞，妄图把香港同胞燃烧起来的伟大反帝烈火扑灭。它调来几艘破军舰，在我国的大门口进行演习，对中国人民进行挑衅。英国政府和香港英国当局表面上气势汹汹，实际上怕得要死。英帝国主义发现它自己坐在香港爱国同胞反帝抗暴斗争的火山上了！因此，它惊惶失措，拚命挣扎，象疯狗一样，乱冲乱咬，大肆镇压，这就充分暴露了英帝国主义的纸老虎的本质。
    我们最伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”英帝国主义利令智昏，愚蠢透顶，它完全错误估计了形势。有着反帝斗争传统的香港中国同胞绝不能容忍帝国主义的欺凌和压迫。正在进行着无产阶级文化大革命的七亿伟大的中国人民更不能坐视不顾。现在，香港中国同胞已经进一步行动起来了，一个波澜壮阔的革命群众运动正席卷着港九，革命群众斗争的怒潮猛烈冲击着英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。用毛泽东思想武装起来的，有伟大祖国作为坚强后盾的香港爱国同胞，同仇敌忾，斗志昂扬，表现出了革命人民一往无前，压倒一切的英雄气概。他们准备随时响应祖国的号召，向英帝国主义发起更大规模的反击，把英帝国主义的反动统治打个落花流水，扔进历史的垃圾堆。伟大的祖国人民也已经作好了充分准备，随时以实际行动来支持香港爱国同胞，直到斗争取得彻底胜利。
    中华人民共和国外交部五月十五日发表了声明，向英国政府提出最强烈的抗议和五项严正要求。但是英国政府迄今不仅没有低头认罪，反而变本加厉地扩大镇压。我们要严重警告英国政府和香港英国当局，目前的香港局势完全是你们一手造成的。毛主席说：“人不犯我，我不犯人；人若犯我，我必犯人。”既然你们如此残暴凶狠地血腥镇压我香港中国同胞，如此不计后果地把局势推到一个十分严重的地步，那么，中国人民和香港中国同胞就有权给你们以狠狠的反击，给你们以加倍的惩罚。
    英帝国主义的滔天罪行必须清算。英帝国主义的累累血债必须偿还。英帝国主义在香港为所欲为的局面必须结束。香港爱国同胞必胜！中国人民必胜！英帝国主义必败！
