Two Attitudes, Two Effects

An Fucun

At the Huabei Metal Structure Factory, two incidents occurred:

One incident: The revolutionary organization in the machine shop issued a copy of the "Reference Book for Studying Chairman Mao's Works" to each member of the organization. A young worker who had participated in a conservative organization also wanted a copy. The person distributing the books said to him, "You want a book? No way!" This comrade heard this and sadly said, "Can't I even study Mao Zedong Thought?" The surrounding masses also felt resentful. Some said, "If you've made a mistake, you need to study Mao Zedong Thought to correct it. Why not encourage him to study?"

Another incident: During a mass meeting, our propaganda team exposed to all the workers in the factory the crimes of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who manufactured stop-work incidents and incited the masses to fight each other. A series of ironclad facts educated the deceived masses. On the spot, two workers who had participated in the conservative organization went up on the stage, tore off their armbands, and declared their withdrawal from the conservative organization to join the revolutionary organization. The revolutionary organization immediately posted a big-character poster welcoming them. Who would have thought that one of the workers, after going back, faced pressure from some people in the conservative organization and his thoughts wavered again. That night, he posted another big-character poster saying, "I tore off my armband in a moment of impulse. Don't think you can gain anything from me."

How should these two incidents be handled? We and the revolutionary organization comrades studied Chairman Mao's works together and had a lively discussion. Some said, "We are a large organization of over a thousand people. We don't need one or two people." Most comrades believed: This is not a matter of one or two people, but of how to treat the deceived masses. If we handle the matter of one or two people well, we can unite hundreds and thousands of people; if we handle it poorly, we will not only lose one or two people, but a broad mass of people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The attitude of the Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone realized: Towards the deceived masses, we should adopt an attitude of warm help, actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and propagate the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Towards their every desire to progress, we should express welcome. Whether to issue a book or not seems like a small matter, but it reflects whether we proletarian revolutionaries can truly act according to Mao Zedong Thought.

Correct the mistake immediately. The revolutionary organization decided: From now on, no matter what is distributed, it will be treated equally, and an apology will be made to the comrade who originally wanted a book but was rebuffed, and the error will be rectified. This way, many people were moved. An old worker said, "Young people make mistakes, which is common. Correcting the mistake is commendable."

How to treat the worker who had already declared to stand on the side of the revolutionary organization but then wavered? At the beginning, there were also different opinions. Some comrades were very angry and wanted to write a big-character poster to mock him. More comrades believed: A person's change in awareness takes a process and cannot be achieved by just one talk or one meeting. Therefore, it is understandable that there is a relapse. Just as Chairman Mao teaches us: "The work of ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and detailed work. One cannot expect to change people's ideological consciousness, which has been formed over decades of life, by just a few classes or meetings." This comrade's relapse shows that our ideological work is not deep enough and detailed enough. We absolutely cannot adopt a mocking and attacking attitude because of his relapse; on the contrary, we should be more active and more enthusiastic towards him. After discussion, the revolutionary faction decided to post another big-character poster, pointing out that this comrade's wavering must not be out of his own will, but due to pressure from the conservative organization. It was clearly stated: The revolutionary faction firmly believes that he will stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Whenever he comes back, he will be welcomed. This way, the effect was very good. Many deceived masses saw that the revolutionary faction was sincerely uniting and helping them, and they withdrew from the conservative organization and joined the revolutionary organization one after another, further developing and strengthening the revolutionary organization's forces, and making the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road even more isolated.

    两种态度　两种效果
    安福存
    在华北金属结构厂，发生过这样两件事：
    一件：机制车间的革命组织，发给本组织的成员每人一本学习毛主席著作参考书。一个参加过保守组织的青年工人也很想要一本。发书的同志冲着他说：“你也想要书，办不到！”这个同志听了，很难过地说：“难道我想学习毛泽东思想也不行吗？”对发书的同志这种做法，周围的群众也有反感。有的说：“犯了错误，正需要学习毛泽东思想，才能改正错误，为什么不去鼓励人家学习呢？”
    一件：在一次大会上，我们宣传队的同志，向全厂职工揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派制造停工事件、挑动群众斗群众的罪恶活动。一系列铁的事实教育了受蒙蔽的群众，当场就有两个参加保守组织的工人登上讲台，撕下袖章，声明退出保守组织，参加革命组织。革命组织当即贴出大字报表示欢迎。谁知道，其中一个工人回去以后，受到保守组织里一些人的压力，思想又动摇了。当晚又贴出一张大字报说：“我撕下袖章，是一时的冲动，你们不要打算在我身上捞稻草。”
    这两件事，应该怎样处理？我们和革命组织的同志一起学习了毛主席著作，展开了热烈的讨论。有的说：“我们是掌了权的一千多人的大组织，不稀罕一两个人。”多数同志认为：这不是一两个人的问题，而是用什么态度对待受蒙蔽群众的问题。一两个人的问题解决好了，就能团结成百上千的人；如果处理不好，失掉的决不只是一两个人，而是广大的群众。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”根据毛主席的教导，大家认识到：对于受蒙蔽的群众，应该采取热情帮助的态度，积极地向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。对于他们每一点要求进步的愿望，都应该表示欢迎。一本书发不发看来是件小事，也反映了我们无产阶级革命派能不能真正按照毛泽东思想办事。
    错了马上就改。革命组织决定：今后不论发什么东西，全都一视同仁，并且向原来要书而碰了钉子的那位同志道歉，检讨了错误。这样做的结果，很多人受到感动。有的老工人说：“青年人做错了事，是常有的。错了就改，就是好样的。”
    怎样对待那位已经表示站到革命组织一边来以后又有反复的工人？开始也有不同的意见。有的同志很气愤，想写张大字报挖苦他一下。更多的同志认为：一个人认识上的转变，要有个过程，不是谈一次话，开一次会就能马上奏效的。因此，出现反复是可以理解的。正象毛主席教导我们的：“思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”这个同志所以出现反复，正说明了我们的思想工作还做得不深入，不细致。绝不能因为他出现反复就采取讽刺、打击的态度；相反地，应该更积极、更热情地对待他。经过研究，革命派决定再贴出一张大字报，指出这个同志的动摇，一定不是出于本意，而是受到保守组织的压力。明确表示：革命派坚信他会站到毛主席的革命路线上来。什么时候回来，什么时候欢迎。这样做，效果很好。很多受蒙蔽的群众认清了革命派是真心诚意地团结他们、帮助他们的，纷纷退出保守组织，参加了革命组织，使革命组织的力量进一步发展壮大，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派更加孤立。
