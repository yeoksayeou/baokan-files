Believing in the masses and the majority of cadres is a consistent thought of Chairman Mao and an important principle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We must firmly believe in and support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat because they are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, what attitude should we adopt towards the masses who have participated in conservative organizations?

We should believe that the majority of the masses who have participated in conservative organizations are our class brothers and are revolutionary. The contradiction between the revolutionary masses and the conservative organization masses is a contradiction within the people. Some of the masses who have participated in conservative organizations have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and are temporarily misled. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for educating and winning over the misled masses. As long as we patiently and carefully do political and ideological work among them, unite with them, and be close to them, this part of the masses will, sooner or later, stand on the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao's proletariat.

Therefore, we must not discriminate against or alienate the masses of conservative organizations. Not associating with them and not listening to their opinions is wrong. As stated in the letter from Comrade Zhu Shitian, the squad leader, published in today's issue: we should widely contact the masses and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses from all sides.

The proletariat has a great and magnificent heart and spirit to liberate all mankind. What is always on their mind is the tens of millions of the masses. Only by uniting with tens of millions of revolutionary masses and uniting with all forces that can be united, can we form a vast revolutionary army and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

We must believe in and rely on the masses and the majority of cadres. All revolutionary masses and cadres who are willing to revolutionize should, on the basis of a consistent revolutionary direction of struggle, achieve a great alliance of revolution. This is the need of today's revolutionary struggle against counter-revolutionary struggle.

    要相信群众的大多数	红　雨
    相信群众和干部的大多数，这是毛主席的一贯思想，也是无产阶级文化大革命的一条重要原则。
    我们应当坚定地相信和支持无产阶级革命派，因为他们是无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。但是，对于参加过保守组织的群众，我们应当采取什么态度呢？
    我们应当相信，参加保守组织的群众，绝大多数是我们的阶级弟兄，是要革命的。革命派和保守组织群众之间的矛盾，属于人民内部矛盾。参加保守组织的群众，有一些是上了资产阶级反动路线的当，暂时受了蒙蔽。战无不胜的毛泽东思想是教育和争取受蒙蔽群众的强大武器。只要我们耐心地细心地向他们做政治思想工作，团结他们，亲近他们，这一部分群众，或早或迟，是会站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的。
    因此，我们切切不可歧视、疏远保守组织的群众。不同他们来往，不听他们的意见是不对的。要象今天本版发表的班长朱士田同志的来信中所说的那样：要广泛地接触群众，虚心听取各方面群众的意见。
    无产阶级具有解放全人类的伟大的胸怀和气魄，头脑中时时想到的是千千万万的人民群众。只有联合亿万的革命群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，才能组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，才能打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    我们一定要相信和依靠群众和干部的大多数。一切革命的和愿意革命的群众和干部，应当在斗争大方向一致的基础上，实行革命的大联合，这是今天的革命向反革命斗争的需要。
