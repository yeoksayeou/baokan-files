On May 30, after this newspaper published the letter from readers titled "Suggestion for Revolutionary Youth to Go to the Countryside to Support the Summer Harvest," we received letters from revolutionary youth, PLA soldiers, and factory workers. They enthusiastically responded to this initiative, expressing their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, actively support the front lines of agricultural production, and stand shoulder to shoulder with poor and lower-middle peasants to fight the summer harvest battle.

Revolutionary youth from the Hebei Agricultural Machinery Institute in Xincheng County, Hebei Province, wrote in a letter: The wheat in the Hebei Plain is about to ripen, and this year's wheat is particularly good, a rare harvest scene in many years. This is a great victory for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production" with practical actions. It is a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside! Doing a good job in this year's summer harvest, ensuring that the abundant grain is stored in the granary, is of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," supporting China's socialist construction, and supporting the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. Therefore, supporting the summer harvest is a glorious duty that we revolutionary youth cannot shirk. We have made full preparations and are ready to march to the wheat harvesting front, fighting side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasant comrades to win this summer harvest battle. The initiative by the readers of the People's Daily is timely and good. We resolutely respond to this initiative!

The entire squad of the Central Institute of Finance and Economics wrote in support of this initiative. They said: Over the past year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and have finally achieved this summer's bumper harvest of crops. Every revolutionary fighter heard this news and was thrilled. The summer harvest is a tense battle of "snatching grain from the dragon's mouth." We, the entire squad, are determined to respond to this initiative, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and participate in this battle. The letter also said: Participating in the summer harvest battle is not only a good opportunity for us to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and change our worldview but also a good opportunity for us to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. We must not miss this opportunity.

PLA soldiers in their letters proposed that supporting the summer harvest is not only about providing manpower and material support to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants but, more importantly, about providing political and ideological support to the poor and lower-middle peasants. This means bringing the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to the countryside and widely spreading it among the class brothers in the countryside. Soldiers from the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison of the PLA expressed in their letter that they have made all preparations to support the summer harvest. The letter said: This year's support for the summer harvest has its unusual significance. It is a precious opportunity for us to concretely implement Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people." In this summer harvest, our unit must take the lead, set an example everywhere, harvest meticulously, and store every grain. We will treat it as an important political task to complete. We will also widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside, propagate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and let Mao Zedong Thought better occupy the countryside.

Workers from the Anhui Ma'anshan Power Plant and other units also wrote in support of this initiative, expressing their willingness to support the countryside in various ways to ensure a good summer harvest without affecting the revolution and production of their own enterprises. They also suggested that literary and artistic workers should go to the countryside to carry out literary and artistic activities to propagate Mao Zedong Thought; commercial workers should also take immediate action to support the summer harvest by doing a good job in supplying production materials and daily necessities.

    坚决和贫下中农并肩打好夏收仗
    ——读者来信综述
    五月三十日，本报发表了“建议革命小将下乡支援夏收”的读者来信以后，陆续收到革命小将、解放军战士和厂矿职工的来信。他们热烈响应这个倡议，表示一定要坚决响应毛主席抓革命、促生产的号召，积极支援农业生产第一线，和贫下中农并肩打好夏收仗。
    河北新城县河北农业机械化学院的革命小将来信说：河北平原上的小麦即将黄熟，今年的小麦长得特别好，是多年来少见的丰收景象。这是广大贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，用实际行动响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命在农村的丰硕成果！搞好今年的夏收，使丰产的粮食颗粒还仓，这对贯彻毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针，支援我国社会主义建设，支援世界人民的革命斗争，都有重要意义。因此，支援夏收是我们革命小将义不容辞的光荣责任。我们已经做好了充分的准备，开赴麦收前线，和贫下中农社员并肩战斗，打好夏收这一仗。人民日报读者的倡议提得及时，提得好，我们坚决响应这个倡议！
    中央财经学院一个战斗队的全体战士来信支持这个倡议。他们说：一年来，广大贫下中农坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，终于获得了今年夏季作物的丰收。每一个革命派战士听了这个消息，无不为之欢欣鼓舞。夏收是“龙口夺粮”的一场紧张战斗，我们全体战士决心响应这个倡议，发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，去参加这场战斗。来信又说：参加夏收的战斗，既是我们向贫下中农学习，改造自己世界观的一个好机会，也是我们向广大贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想的一个好机会。我们一定不放过这个机会。
    解放军战士在来信里提出，支援夏收，不但要在人力物力上支援广大贫下中农，尤其重要的，是要在政治思想上支援贫下中农，这就是要把光焰无际的毛泽东思想带到农村，广泛传播给农村的阶级兄弟。解放军驻北京部队某部八连的战士，在来信中表示，他们已作好一切准备，去支援夏收。信中说：今年支援夏收有它不平常的意义，这是我们具体地执行毛主席“拥军爱民”伟大号召的宝贵时机。在这次夏收中，我们部队一定要走在最前头，处处作出模范，要精打细收，颗粒归仓，把它作为一项重要的政治任务来完成，我们还要在农村中广泛宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命和毛主席的革命路线，让毛泽东思想更好地占领农村阵地。
    安徽马鞍山发电厂等单位的工人，也来信支持这个倡议，表示要在不影响本企业的革命和生产的前提下，以各种不同的方式，支援农村搞好夏收。他们还建议文艺工作者也下乡去，开展文艺活动，宣传毛泽东思想；商业工作者也要迅速行动起来，用做好生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，来支援夏收。
