	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	We must always keep in mind that our country is a large socialist country, but also a poor country with a backward economy. This is a great contradiction. To make our country prosperous and strong, we need several decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposing waste in the construction of our country.

		From "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"

    毛主席语录
    要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。
