Revolutionary writers and friends from various countries participating in the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference warmly acclaim Chairman Mao as the great helmsman of the world revolutionary ship.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from June 2nd, "Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time, the great teacher of all revolutionary people in the world. All revolutionary literary and artistic workers in the world should be good students of Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, make literature and art an integral part of the entire revolutionary machine, serve proletarian politics, serve the revolutionary struggle, and become a sharp weapon to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries." At the conference held by the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," various countries' revolutionary writers and friends expressed their revolutionary resolve in such resolute and powerful language.

At the beginning of today's discussion, writers and friends from the six continents, full of revolutionary passion, read Chairman Mao's quotations in different languages and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on revolutionary literature and art. In their speeches, various countries' friends once again enthusiastically praised the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and once again expressed their most sincere revolutionary feelings for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. They exclaimed:

"Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time!"

"Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of the world revolutionary ship!"

"Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people, the leader of the world's revolutionary people, the red sun in our hearts!"

"Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun, shining in every corner of the earth!"

"Mao Zedong Thought is a sturdy pine standing tall in the snowstorm, a coral reef unyielding to the waves, a sharp sword to defeat the enemy!"

The friends from various countries said: The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will never change!

Today, those who spoke at the conference included: Indonesian writer Risagoda, Somali friend Beker, Congolese (Kinshasa) friend Miu Kangge Dedona, Sudanese writer Kail, and the Filipino writer invited to participate in the discussion.

Indonesian writer Risagoda, representing the Indonesian friends participating in the discussion, spoke on the topic "Let the Great Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought Fly Over the World." He said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is the highest achievement in the literary and artistic field in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. It is the magic weapon for the Indonesian people and all oppressed people in the world to win revolutionary victories. He said that the Indonesian people and revolutionary writers have come to realize from their own struggles that Mao Zedong Thought is the only guiding ideology for the victory of the Indonesian revolution. Our revolution will follow the path of armed revolution under the leadership of our great teacher, Chairman Mao. If we deviate from the teachings of our great teacher, Chairman Mao, the revolution will suffer setbacks.

Risagoda said, Chairman Mao taught us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. However, having only this kind of army is not enough. We must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Chairman Mao's teachings have made us Indonesian writers deeply realize that without a revolutionary armed force directly led by the proletariat of our own country, even if the influence of the cultural force is great, it will not make our revolution victorious. This is our experience. He said, to seize power, we need a revolutionary army, and we also need to prepare ideologically. Literature and art are an important link in creating public opinion among the people and overthrowing the reactionary regime.

Risagoda said, the Indonesian people and Indonesian revolutionary writers are full of revolutionary confidence and are determined to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and turn the Indonesian revolution into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the only way out for the Indonesian revolution. Only Mao Zedong Thought can bring victory to the Indonesian people's revolution.

Somali friend Beker said in his speech that the world is now entering a new era under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's "Talks" is like the dawn, telling revolutionary artists and writers that literature and art should become a powerful weapon and force in the political struggle of the proletariat.

He said, Chairman Mao said: "The question of people is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Is literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or a small group of exploiters? Is it serving the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? This is the dividing line between proletarian literature and art and bourgeois literature and art, between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism.

He enthusiastically said that under the leadership of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a red lighthouse guiding all revolutionaries to victory. This revolution has helped the liberation movements in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world. Revolutionary people in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have found the correct solutions to the issues they face in their cause.

Beker finally said with deep emotion, Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people, the leader of all revolutionary people in the world. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We Africans, as long as we correctly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, can drive imperialism and its running dogs out of our land and become the masters of our country.

"Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" This was the first sentence in the speech by Congolese (Kinshasa) friend Miu Kangge Dedona. His speech expressed the boundless love of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people, who are fighting against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, for the great leader, Chairman Mao. He said that the peoples of various countries in their struggles are armed with the brilliant thoughts of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, and are fighting under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, we arm ourselves with guns to engage in armed struggle against imperialism, and we also arm ourselves with pens to engage in ideological struggle against imperialism. We are able to fight on both the military and ideological fronts because Mao Zedong Thought has taught us.

Sudanese writer Kail said in his speech that Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general revolutionary front." We Sudanese people are now in the stage of national democratic revolution. Our main enemies are imperialism led by the United States, the semi-feudal class, and the comprador class. Our revolutionary literary and artistic workers must "resolutely overcome difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and strive for victory," making literature and art truly a powerful weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

He said, in Sudan, modern revisionists have openly betrayed Marxism and the revolution. They have become open traitors to the Sudanese people's revolutionary cause and pitiful running dogs of Soviet modern revisionists. We believe that the fate of such scum will not be better than that of all traitors and running dogs.

Kail said that since the true revolutionaries of Sudan came into contact with Mao Zedong Thought, our literary and artistic workers have been nourished by Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts, realizing that literature and art must become a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike the enemy, and annihilate the enemy. This is a major change in the revolutionary history of our people, which will have a decisive influence on the future of our people.

He said, now, the revolutionary literary and artistic workers of Sudan have taken Chairman Mao's "Talks" as the guiding direction for their revolutionary literary and artistic activities, using this powerful weapon of literature and art to call on the people to unite and fight against the enemy, to oppose imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, and to strive for the victory of the national democratic revolution.

The Filipino writer invited to participate in the discussion visited the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an on May 23rd, the day Chairman Mao concluded his "Talks" 25 years ago. Today, he said excitedly at the discussion that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a programmatic document of great and far-reaching significance. It is a powerful ideological weapon for revolutionary people to struggle for liberation and a powerful ideological weapon for revolutionary people to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat in a socialist society.

In his speech, he warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has strengthened the ideological revolution of the people, ensuring that China will never change color politically and will always be a stronghold of the world revolution.

Today, the various countries' writers and friends present at the conference applauded enthusiastically for the speakers' ability to combine their own countries' revolutionary practices and actively apply Mao Zedong Thought. When the conference adjourned, everyone once again shouted "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!" After the various countries' writers and friends left the venue, they still shook hands warmly and encouraged each other, expressing their determination to advance victoriously on the revolutionary road under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    参加亚非作家常设局讨论会的各国革命作家和朋友热烈欢呼
    毛主席是世界革命航船的伟大舵手
    据新华社二日讯　“毛主席是当代的列宁，是全世界革命人民的伟大导师。全世界革命的文艺工作者要做毛主席的好学生，按照毛主席的教导，把文艺作为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，使文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为革命斗争服务，成为战胜帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的锐利武器。”在亚非作家常设局举行的纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会今天的大会上，各国革命作家和朋友在发言中，用这种金石般铿锵有力的语言，表达了他们的革命的决心。
    今天的讨论会开始时，来自世界六大洲的作家和朋友，满怀革命激情，用不同的语言，齐声朗读毛主席语录，学习毛主席关于革命文艺问题的教导。各国朋友在发言中再一次热情洋溢地赞颂光焰无际的毛泽东思想，再一次倾吐了对世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席最真挚的革命感情。他们欢呼：
    “毛主席是当代的列宁！”
    “毛主席是世界革命航船的伟大舵手！”
    “毛主席是中国人民的领袖，是世界革命人民的领袖，是我们心中的红太阳！”
    “毛泽东思想象红太阳，照射地球的每一个角落！”
    “毛泽东思想是巍然屹立在雪山风暴中的劲松，是不怕狂风巨浪冲击的珊瑚岩，是战胜敌人的利剑！”
    各国朋友们说：海可枯，石可烂，我们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的忠诚之心永远不变！
    今天，在讨论会上发言的有：印度尼西亚作家里莎戈达、索马里朋友贝克尔、刚果（金）朋友谬康格·德多纳、苏丹作家凯尔和应邀参加讨论会的菲律宾作家。
    印度尼西亚作家里莎戈达代表参加讨论会的印度尼西亚朋友，以《让毛泽东思想伟大红旗飘扬全世界》为题发言。他说，毛主席的《讲话》这一光辉著作，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利时代在文艺领域里的最高成果，是印度尼西亚人民和全世界被压迫人民赢得革命胜利的法宝。他说，印度尼西亚人民和革命作家从自己斗争中认识到，毛泽东思想是使印尼革命取得胜利的唯一指导思想，我国革命将走毛泽东武装革命的道路，如果背离我们伟大导师毛主席的教导，革命就会遭到挫折。
    里莎戈达说，毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”毛主席的教导，使我们印尼作家深深认识到，没有本国无产阶级直接领导下的革命武装部队，即使文化队伍的影响再大，它也不会使自己的革命取得胜利。这是我们的经验。他说，为了夺取政权，就需要有一支革命的军队，还要在意识形态上做准备，而文学艺术是在人民群众当中制造舆论，推翻反动政权的最重要的一个环节。
    里莎戈达说，印尼人民和印尼革命作家充满革命信心，决心高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把印尼革命变成毛泽东思想的大学校。这是印尼革命的唯一出路。只有毛泽东思想才能给印尼人民的革命带来胜利。
    索马里朋友贝克尔在发言中说，现在世界正进入一个崭新的以毛泽东思想为旗帜的伟大时代。毛主席的《讲话》象黎明的曙光，它告诉革命的艺术家和文学家，文艺应该成为无产阶级政治斗争的有力武器和强大力量。
    他说，毛主席说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”文艺是为工农兵服务，还是为一小撮剥削者服务，是为无产阶级服务，还是为资产阶级服务？这就是无产阶级文艺和资产阶级文艺之间，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和修正主义之间的一个分界线。
    他热情地说，在我们心中的红太阳毛主席领导下进行的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是引导一切革命者胜利前进的红色灯塔。这场革命，帮助了亚非拉及全世界其他各地的解放运动。革命人民在这场史无前例的文化大革命中为他们所进行的事业和面临的问题找到了正确解决的方法。
    贝克尔最后满怀深情地说，毛主席是中国人民的领袖，是世界所有革命人民的领袖。毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。我们非洲人只要正确地学习和运用毛主席著作，就能够把帝国主义及其走狗从我们的土地上赶出去，就能够成为我们国家的主人。
    “毛泽东思想万岁！”这是刚果（金）朋友谬康格·德多纳在致词中的第一句话。他的致词表达了正在同美帝国主义及其走狗斗争的刚果（金）人民，对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。他说，我们斗争中的各国人民，是以当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的光辉思想武装起来，并在毛泽东思想的指引下进行着斗争。他说，我们用枪武装起来同帝国主义进行武装斗争，我们也用笔武装起来同帝国主义进行论战。我们能够在文武两条战线上进行斗争，都是因为毛泽东思想教导了我们。
    苏丹作家凯尔在发言中说，毛主席教导我们：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”我们苏丹人民现在正处在民族民主革命阶段，我们的主要敌人是以美国为首的帝国主义、半封建阶级和买办阶级。我们革命的文艺工作者，一定要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，使文艺真正成为反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的有力武器。
    他说，在苏丹，现代修正主义者已公开背叛了马克思主义，背叛了革命。他们已经变成了苏丹人民革命事业的公开叛徒，成了苏联现代修正主义者的可怜走狗。我们相信，这类渣滓的命运决不会比所有的叛徒和走狗的命运好一些。
    凯尔说，自从苏丹真正的革命战士接触到毛泽东思想以后，我们的文艺工作者才从毛主席的文艺思想中得到滋养，认识到文艺必须成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。这是我国人民革命历史上的一个重大变化，它将对我国人民的未来发生决定性的影响。
    他说，现在，苏丹革命的文艺工作者已经把毛主席的《讲话》，作为自己进行革命文艺活动的指导方向，通过文艺这个有力的武器，号召人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争，以反对美国为首的帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派，为争取民族民主革命的胜利而奋斗。
    应邀参加讨论会的菲律宾作家，在五月二十三日——二十五年前毛主席发表《讲话》结论部分的这一天，访问了革命圣地延安。今天他在讨论会上激动地说，毛主席的《讲话》是一个具有十分深远意义的纲领性文件。它是革命人民争取解放斗争的强大思想武器，又是革命人民在社会主义社会里巩固无产阶级专政的强大思想武器。
    他在发言中热烈赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，加强了人的思想革命化，保证中国在政治上永远不会改变颜色，始终是世界革命的坚强堡垒。
    今天到会的各国作家和朋友，为发言者能够结合各自国家的革命实践，活学活用毛泽东思想，发出一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。大会休会时，大家再一次高呼“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”各国作家和朋友走出会场以后，还互相亲切握手，共同勉励，表示要在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，在革命的大道上胜利前进。
