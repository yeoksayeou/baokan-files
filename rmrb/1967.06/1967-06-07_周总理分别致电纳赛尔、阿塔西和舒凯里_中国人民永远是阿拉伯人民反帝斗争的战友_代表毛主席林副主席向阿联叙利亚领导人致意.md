Premier Zhou sent telegrams to Nasser, Atassi, and Shukairy on June 6, expressing that the Chinese people will always stand with the Arab people in their anti-imperialist struggle. He conveyed greetings and respect from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to the leaders of the United Arab Republic and Syria.

	New China News Agency, June 6 - Premier Zhou sent a telegram to President Nasser of the United Arab Republic on June 6, expressing that the Chinese government and people firmly stand with the people of the United Arab Republic and all Arab peoples in their struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel. He also conveyed greetings and respect from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to President Nasser. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To His Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic, Cairo:

	On June 5, 1967, Israel, instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism, launched a treacherous surprise attack on your capital Cairo, the Suez Canal, and the Gaza Strip, initiating an aggressive war against the entire Arab nation and people. The United Arab Republic, with its anti-imperialist tradition, and all Arab peoples, fearless of violence, united in their hatred of the enemy, have dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors, winning the sympathy and praise of the anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

	Israel's aggression was long-planned and launched with the political and military support of U.S. President Johnson. The facts once again prove that U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit supporting Israel's aggression against Arab countries and the most vicious enemy of the Arab peoples. The Chinese people and government fully agree with President Nasser's statement on May 2 that U.S. imperialism is the "head of world counter-revolutionary forces."

	Currently, the global anti-imperialist struggle is in a favorable situation. U.S. imperialism is surrounded by the peoples of the world. The war adventure of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, can only provoke more resolute resistance from the Arab peoples, accelerating its own downfall. In 1956, the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt ended badly, and today, U.S. imperialism's instigation and support of Israel's aggression against Arab countries will also end badly.

	The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." The Chinese government and people have always highly valued the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab peoples, regarding their struggle as our own, and their victories as our victories. Now, I wish to reiterate to Your Excellency that in the struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, the Chinese government and people will firmly stand with the United Arab Republic and all Arab peoples, forever being their loyal and reliable comrades-in-arms.

	Finally, please allow me, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and in my personal capacity, to extend heartfelt greetings and respect to Your Excellency.

	Beijing, June 6, 1967

	New China News Agency, June 6 - Premier Zhou sent a telegram to President Atassi of Syria on June 6, expressing that the Chinese government and the 700 million Chinese people will, as always, firmly stand with the Syrian people and the peoples of all Arab countries, fully supporting their just struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel. He also conveyed greetings and respect from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to President Atassi. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To His Excellency President Nuruddin Atassi of the Syrian Arab Republic, Damascus:

	On June 5, Israel, instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism, launched a military aggression against your country. This is a new and serious war provocation against Syria and all Arab peoples.

	Facing imperialist aggression, the government and people of the Syrian Arab Republic have engaged in a resolute and powerful counterattack.

	Your just actions express the firm will of the Syrian people and all Arab peoples to resist U.S. imperialism and Israeli aggression, winning the sympathy and praise of the anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. The Chinese government and the 700 million Chinese people will, as always, firmly stand with the Syrian people and the peoples of all Arab countries, fully supporting your just struggle against aggression.

	The facts once again show that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Syrian people and the peoples of all Arab countries, the root of all disasters for the Arab peoples. The aggression launched by U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, does not indicate its strength but rather its desperation and death throes. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has long pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." I am deeply convinced that the Syrian people and the peoples of all Arab countries, with their glorious anti-imperialist traditions and courage, will, in this anti-aggression struggle, achieve final victory as long as they strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, with the sympathy and support of the peoples of the world.

	Finally, please allow me, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and in my personal capacity, to extend heartfelt greetings and respect to Your Excellency.

	Premier Zhou Enlai
	Beijing, June 6, 1967

	New China News Agency, June 6 - Premier Zhou sent a telegram to Chairman Shukairy of the Palestine Liberation Organization on June 6, expressing that the Chinese government and people firmly support the Palestinian people and the peoples of all Arab countries in their just struggle against U.S. and British imperialism and their lackey, Israel. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To His Excellency Chairman Ahmad Shukairy of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Cairo:

	Israel, instigated and supported by U.S. and British imperialism, has launched a large-scale armed attack on Arab countries and peoples.

	The Arab peoples, united as one, are waging a just anti-aggression war. The Palestinian Arab people and the Palestine Liberation Army have taken up their battle positions, fighting alongside all Arab soldiers and civilians, displaying a spirit of bravery and fearlessness in the face of sacrifice, dealing a heavy blow to the aggressors.

	Israel is a product of the aggressive policies of U.S. and British imperialism. Nineteen years ago, with the support of U.S. and British imperialism, Israel occupied the homeland of the Palestinian Arab people, forcing millions of Palestinians into exile and becoming refugees.

	Today, the oppressed Arab peoples and the long-suffering Palestinians have risen up. Where there is oppression, there is resistance; where there is aggression, there is anti-aggression. I believe that once the revolutionary Palestinian Arab people and all Arab peoples take up arms, they will not lay them down, fighting tenaciously and unyieldingly like the heroic Vietnamese people, until they achieve final victory.

	Currently, the global anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle is in a favorable situation. U.S. imperialism is surrounded by the Vietnamese people, the Arab peoples, and the revolutionary peoples of the world. You have repeatedly stated that only armed struggle can liberate Palestine. I highly appreciate Your Excellency's clear vision. Today, the just war of the Arab countries and peoples against U.S. and British imperialism and Israel is a good beginning for the struggle to liberate Palestine.

	The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." The revolutionary struggle of the Palestinian Arab people will once again prove this unshakable truth.

	The Chinese people will forever be the anti-imperialist comrades-in-arms of the Palestinian people and the peoples of all Arab countries. The Chinese government and people will, as always, stand with you, firmly supporting your just struggle against U.S. and British imperialism and their lackey, Israel, to the end.

	Please accept my greetings and respect.

	Premier Zhou Enlai
	Beijing, June 6, 1967

    周总理分别致电纳赛尔、阿塔西和舒凯里
    中国人民永远是阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的战友
    代表毛主席林副主席向阿联叙利亚领导人致意
    新华社六日讯　周恩来总理六日打电报给阿联总统纳赛尔，表示在阿联人民和全体阿拉伯人民反击美帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略的斗争中，中国政府和人民坚决站在阿联和全体阿拉伯人民一边；并代表毛主席和林副主席向纳赛尔致以衷心的问候和敬意。电报全文如下：开罗尊敬的阿拉伯联合共和国总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔阁下：
    一九六七年六月五日，以色列在美帝国主义的策动和支持下，对贵国首都开罗、苏伊士运河和加沙等地区发动卑劣的突然袭击，对整个阿拉伯国家和人民挑起了一场侵略战争。具有反帝传统的阿联和全体阿拉伯人民，不畏强暴，同仇敌忾，沉重地打击了侵略者的凶焰，赢得了亚洲、非洲和全世界一切反帝革命人民的同情和赞扬。
    以色列这次侵略行径是蓄谋已久的，是在得到美国总统约翰逊的政治和军事支持的保证后发动的。事实再次表明，美帝国主义是支持以色列对阿拉伯国家进行侵略的罪魁祸首，是阿拉伯各国人民最凶恶的敌人。中国人民和中国政府完全同意总统阁下五月二日所说的美帝国主义是“世界反革命势力的头子”这个正确的论断。
    当前，全世界反帝斗争形势大好。美帝国主义已经陷入全世界人民重重包围之中。美帝国主义及其工具以色列的战争冒险，只能激起阿拉伯人民更加坚决的反抗，加速它自己的灭亡。一九五六年英、法、以三国侵略埃及没有好下场，今天美帝策动和支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家，也决不会有好下场。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”中国政府和人民一向对阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争给予高度的评价，把他们的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看作是自己的胜利。现在我愿再次向阁下表示，在反击美帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略的斗争中，中国政府和人民坚决站在阿联和全体阿拉伯人民一边，永远作阿拉伯人民忠实可靠的战友。
    最后，请允许我代表毛泽东主席、林彪副主席，并以我本人的名义，向阁下致以衷心的问候和敬意。
                           中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                                   一九六七年六月六日于北京
    新华社六日讯　周恩来总理六日打电报给叙利亚国家元首阿塔西，表示中国政府和七亿中国人民将一如既往地、坚定地站在叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民一边，全力支持他们反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略的正义斗争，并代表毛主席和林副主席向阿塔西致以衷心的问候和敬意。电报全文如下：大马士革尊敬的阿拉伯叙利亚共和国国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西阁下：
    六月五日，以色列在美帝国主义的策动和支持下悍然对贵国进行了军事侵略。这是对叙利亚和全体阿拉伯人民的一次新的、严重的战争挑衅。
    面对帝国主义的侵略，阿拉伯叙利亚共和国政府和人民进行了针锋相对的斗争，给侵略者以坚决、有力的回击。
    你们这种正义的行动，表达了叙利亚人民和全体阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略的坚强意志，赢得了亚洲、非洲和全世界一切反帝革命人民的同情和赞扬。中国政府和七亿中国人民将一如既往地、坚定地站在叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民一边，全力支持你们反对侵略的正义斗争。
    事实再一次表明，美帝国主义是叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民的头号敌人，是阿拉伯人民一切灾难的根源。美帝国主义和它的工具以色列发动这场侵略战争，绝不表明它的强大，恰恰相反，是它走投无路，垂死挣扎的表现。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”我深信，具有光荣反帝传统的、英勇的叙利亚和阿拉伯各国人民，在这场反侵略的斗争中，只要加强团结，坚持斗争，在全世界人民的同情和支持下，必将取得最后的胜利。
    最后，请允许我代表毛泽东主席、林彪副主席，并以我个人的名义，向阁下致以衷心的问候和敬意。
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来
                                               一九六七年六
                                                月六日于北京
    新华社六日讯　周恩来总理六日打电报给巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里，表示中国政府和人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民把反对美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列的正义斗争进行到底。电报全文如下：开罗巴勒斯坦解放组织主席艾
  哈迈德·舒凯里阁下：
    以色列在美英帝国主义的策动和支持下，悍然对阿拉伯国家和人民发动了大规模的武装进攻。
    阿拉伯人民团结一致，正在进行着一场正义的反侵略战争。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和巴勒斯坦解放军已经走上战斗岗位，同全体阿拉伯军民一道，发扬英勇战斗不怕牺牲的精神，给予侵略者以迎头痛击。
    以色列是美英帝国主义侵略政策的产物。十九年前，以色列在美英帝国主义的支持下，霸占了巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的家园，迫使成百万巴勒斯坦人流离失所，沦为难民。
    今天，被压迫的阿拉伯人民和饱经忧患的巴勒斯坦人站起来了。有压迫就有反抗，有侵略就有反侵略。我相信，革命的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和全体阿拉伯人民一旦拿起武器，就不会再放下武器，就会象英雄的越南人民那样，不屈不挠，坚决顽强地斗争下去，直到最后胜利。
    目前，全世界反帝革命斗争的形势大好。美帝国主义已处在越南人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民的重重包围之中。阁下曾经多次表示，只有武装斗争才能解放巴勒斯坦。我很钦佩阁下这种明确的见解。今天阿拉伯国家和阿拉伯人民反对美英帝国主义和以色列侵略的正义战争，就是解放巴勒斯坦斗争的良好开端。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的革命斗争实践，将再次证实这个颠扑不破的真理。
    中国人民永远是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民的反帝战友。中国政府和人民将一如既往地站在你们一边，坚决支持你们把反对美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列的正义斗争进行到底。
    请接受我的问候和致意。
　　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来
　　一九六七年六月六日于北京
