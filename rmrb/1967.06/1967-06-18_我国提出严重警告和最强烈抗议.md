	On the Indian Government's Plot to Attack the Chinese Embassy and Cut Off Telecommunications with the Domestic Government
	China Issues Severe Warning and Strongest Protest
	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announces: Effective Immediately, All Indian Staff at the Indian Embassy in China Must Not Leave the Embassy Without Permission from the Relevant Chinese Authorities

	New China News Agency, June 17th: This morning, a responsible official from the First Asian Division of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Indian Embassy in China, Sathe, and handed him a note. The note expresses a severe warning and the strongest protest to the Indian government for orchestrating the serious atrocity of attacking the Chinese Embassy in India. The full text of the note is as follows:

	To the Indian Embassy in China:

	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sends this note to the Indian Embassy in China and states the following:

	According to foreign news reports, on June 16th, a large mob of Indian rioters stormed the Chinese Embassy in India, severely beating embassy staff, damaging buildings, and burning cars. These rioters publicly tore down and destroyed the solemn national flag of the People's Republic of China from the flagpole and brutally beat the Chinese embassy staff who were protecting the Chinese flag, injuring eight people seriously. What is even more intolerable is that the Indian rioters dared to insult the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. This is a great provocation to the 700 million Chinese people. These serious acts of violating international relations norms are entirely orchestrated by the Indian government, which has aroused the great indignation of the Chinese people. The Chinese government issues a severe warning and the strongest protest to the Indian government.

	It must also be pointed out that the Indian government has trampled on the most basic norms of international relations and vilely cut off telecommunications between the Chinese Embassy in India and the Chinese government, resulting in the Chinese government not yet receiving a report from the Chinese Embassy on this incident. The Chinese government reserves the right to make further demands and negotiations upon receiving the official report.

	At present, the Chinese government deems it necessary to take emergency measures: Effective immediately, all Indian staff at the Indian Embassy in China must not leave the embassy without permission from the relevant Chinese authorities. Otherwise, the Indian side will bear all consequences.

	Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

    对印度政府策划袭击我使馆并中断我使馆与国内电报联系
    我国提出严重警告和最强烈抗议
    我外交部照会严正宣布：自即时起，印度驻华使馆全体印籍人员，未经中国有关当局许可，一律不许离开大使馆
    新华社十七日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人，今天上午召见了印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，交给他一件照会，就印度政府一手策划的袭击我国驻印度大使馆的严重暴行，向印度政府提出严重警告和最强烈抗议。照会全文如下：印度驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部照会印度驻华大使馆，并申述如下：
    据外电报道，六月十六日，大批印度暴徒冲进中国驻印度大使馆，大肆殴打大使馆人员，破坏建筑物，焚毁汽车。这些暴徒公然从旗杆上扯下和撕毁庄严的中华人民共和国国旗，并且毒打保护中国国旗的中国大使馆人员，使八人重伤。尤其令人不能容忍的是，印度暴徒竟敢侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。这是对七亿中国人民的极大的挑衅。这些破坏国际关系准则的严重暴行，完全是印度政府一手策划的，激起了中国人民的极大愤怒。中国政府向印度政府提出严重警告和最强烈抗议。
    还必须指出，印度政府竟践踏最起码的国际关系准则，卑鄙地中断了中国驻印度大使馆同中国政府的电报联系，致使中国政府迄今未接到中国大使馆对这一事件的报告。中国政府保留在得到正式报告后作进一步交涉和提出要求的权利。
    现在，中国政府认为有必要采取紧急措施：自即时起，印度驻华大使馆全体印籍人员，未经中国有关当局的许可，一律不许离开大使馆。否则，一切后果由印度方面自己承担。
                            中华人民共和国外交部
