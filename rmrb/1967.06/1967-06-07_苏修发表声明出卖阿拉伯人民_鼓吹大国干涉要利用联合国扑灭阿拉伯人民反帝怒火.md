In the activities of the U.S. imperialists inciting Israel to launch an aggression against the Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leadership group has, from the very beginning, colluded with the U.S. side in every possible way to extinguish the Arab people's fury against the aggression. On the very day after Israel launched its aggression, the Soviet revisionist group issued another statement that pretends to support but actually betrays the Arab people. This statement, like the one issued on May 23, does not condemn the U.S. imperialists, the chief culprits behind this war of aggression, but instead more blatantly calls for "eliminating military conflicts," "extinguishing the flames of war in the Middle East," and "restoring peace," making every effort to exonerate the U.S. imperialists' aggressive actions.

In the statement, the Soviet revisionists vigorously advocate that "other countries, including the great powers, should also do everything in their power to extinguish the flames of war in the Middle East and restore peace"; they falsely claim that "the United Nations should fulfill its direct responsibilities" and "quickly take the necessary measures to restore peace in the Middle East." This fully shows that the Soviet revisionists intend to further collude with U.S. and British imperialism to use the United Nations to promote "power politics," demanding that the Arab people meekly submit to the arbitrary manipulation and slaughter of these few bullies.

    苏修发表声明出卖阿拉伯人民
    鼓吹大国干涉要利用联合国扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝怒火
    据新华社六日讯　在美帝国主义唆使以色列对阿拉伯国家发动侵略的活动中，苏修领导集团自始至终同美方串通一气，千方百计地来扑灭阿拉伯人民的反抗侵略的怒火。就在以色列发动侵略的第二天，苏修集团又发表一个对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的声明。这个声明同五月二十三日的第一个声明一样，对发动这场侵略战争的罪魁祸首美帝国主义只字不加谴责，却更加露骨地叫嚷“消除军事冲突”、“熄灭近东的战火”、“恢复和平”，极力为美帝的侵略行为开脱罪责。
    苏修在声明中竭力鼓吹“包括大国在内的其他国家政府也从自己方面尽一切努力来熄灭近东的战火和恢复和平”；胡说什么“联合国应当履行自己的直接职责”，“火速采取恢复近东和平所必要的措施”。这充分表明，苏修企图进一步勾结美英帝国主义利用联合国，推行“强权政治”，要阿拉伯人民俯首贴耳地听从它们这几个恶霸的任意摆布和宰割。
