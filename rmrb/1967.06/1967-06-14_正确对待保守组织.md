Chairman Mao says: "Organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries." How to correctly handle conservative forces is an important issue in uniting the majority of the masses, organizing a vast cultural revolution army, and isolating and striking at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

How should the revolutionary forces correctly handle conservative forces? Our main experience is as follows:

1. **Grasp the Main Contradiction, Identify the Enemy, and Maintain the Direction of Struggle.**

Chairman Mao says: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." This year, the seventh issue of *Red Flag* states: "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the main contradiction we need to resolve is the contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." We have acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings. We have always grasped the main contradiction, identified the main enemy, directed the spearhead of struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and firmly grasped the direction of struggle. We have never directed the spearhead at conservative forces but have, in the course of struggle, united, educated, and won them over to jointly fight the enemy.

Our understanding of this issue has been gradually deepening and clarifying. At the beginning of this year, when the bourgeois reactionary line was launching a new counterattack and spreading the poisonous wind of counter-revolutionary economism, the political department of our Food Company was paralyzed. At this moment, the revolutionary forces of the company, driven by the great storm of the "January Revolution," took over the political department through struggle and bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. At that time, some comrades in the revolutionary forces deeply felt the serious harm caused by the bourgeois reactionary line to the Party, the state, and the people, and were very dissatisfied with the conservatives who had not yet risen up to rebel, saying, "They are die-hard conservatives," and so on. Several responsible comrades in the revolutionary forces, together with revolutionary leading cadres, studied *On Contradiction*, *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, and relevant editorials from *Red Flag* with problems in mind, gradually unified their thinking. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving more than two contradictions, we must concentrate all our efforts on finding the principal contradiction. Once we grasp this principal contradiction, everything else will fall into place." Everyone realized: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the contradiction between us and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the principal contradiction, a question of enemy and us; the contradiction with conservative forces is a contradiction among the people, a secondary question. Subsequently, everyone conducted a class analysis of the relatively conservative masses in the political department at that time, believing that they generally came from the working people, had always performed well in the past, and loved the Party and Chairman Mao. However, due to being deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, they joined conservative organizations. We should help them raise their consciousness and urge them to rise up in revolution. We must see their progress with a developmental perspective and cannot regard conservative forces as fixed and unchanging. As long as they truly rise up in revolution, we should encourage and welcome them and never adopt an attitude of punishment or exclusion.

The leadership's thinking was unified, and then the entire committee was organized to study relevant documents. Through discussion, the majority of the committee members agreed with the above views, but some comrades' thinking was not yet clear. Therefore, we convened expanded committee meetings and general meetings of all members, seriously studied the works of Chairman Mao, fully carried out great democracy, and engaged in a two-day mass debate, finally unifying our thinking and correctly handling the relationship with the deceived masses in the political department.

Chairman Mao says: "In general, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic. However, if they are not handled properly, or if one loses vigilance and becomes complacent, antagonism may arise." We conducted a serious and concrete analysis of the masses' organizations that had made mistakes or held erroneous views, and treated them differently. For the masses' organizations that were deeply poisoned by economism and put forward unreasonable economic welfare demands, the revolutionary forces firmly resisted them, debated with them, and educated them to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, grasping the direction of struggle; for their active participation in all revolutionary activities to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, we firmly supported them. Some masses' organizations, due to not understanding the truth, had previously associated with illegal organizations in society. We did not indiscriminately condemn them but dealt with them according to the actual situation. We strictly distinguished this type of organization from illegal organizations and distinguished the few leaders who insisted on their errors from the vast majority of deceived masses. Even for the leaders of this type of organization, as long as they did not insist on and repeatedly make their errors, we still allowed them to correct their errors through criticism and encouraged them to make amends. For the broad masses who were deceived, we always adopted the method of persuasion and education. The revolutionary forces of the cattle and mutton sales department of the company once insisted on smashing a conservative organization. Later, through studying the works of Chairman Mao, they realized: the more you smash, the more you suppress, the more you create opposition. Smashing only causes state property to be damaged and does not smash the "selfishness" in people's minds. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. For erroneous thoughts, one must adopt the method of persuasion and debate to solve them. Later, through debate and education, many members of this organization truly realized that their organization's direction was wrong and voluntarily withdrew, actively joined the revolution, and many joined the revolutionary forces, thus strengthening the leftist forces.

2. **Firmly Believe in the Masses, Persist in Persuasion and Education, and Inspire Conservative Forces to Educate and Liberate Themselves in Struggle.**

We have come to understand that to correctly handle conservative forces, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings about believing in the majority of the masses. Practice has proven that the masses who were temporarily deceived and joined conservative organizations can educate and liberate themselves in struggle.

The revolutionary forces of the company helped the masses who joined conservative organizations repeatedly study the beginning of Chairman Mao's *On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas*: "There are various non-proletarian ideas within the Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line." Everyone linked this to their thoughts and examined what non-proletarian ideas they had that hindered the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Later, through repeated study of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and relevant editorials from *Red Flag*, their understanding gradually deepened. An old worker in the cooked meat sales department was initially deceived and joined the Workers' Militia, even becoming a cadre. Later, through exposing and criticizing the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Shanghai in suppressing the masses and harming the revolution, he was greatly shocked and realized he had been deceived. He withdrew from the Workers' Militia and resolutely stood up to rebel, even joining the revolutionary forces' organization.

For those who had more concerns and did not yet understand, we also paid attention to doing painstaking and detailed political and ideological work, patiently inspiring them to consciously rebel. There was a newly admitted Party member and demobilized soldier in the company who had always performed well in the past but was deceived and joined a conservative organization during this movement, even becoming one of the main responsible persons. Later, he went to Beijing to "link up" and received deep education. Upon his return, he wanted to stand up to rebel but was afraid that the revolutionary forces would not believe him, afraid that handing over the "important records" prepared for settling accounts later would lead to struggle, and so on, making him very troubled. Revolutionary comrades and revolutionary leading cadres had several heart-to-heart talks with him, studied the works of Chairman Mao together, helped him raise his understanding of the struggle between the two lines, raise his class consciousness, inspire him to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and consciously rebel. Seeing the revolutionary masses and revolutionary leading cadres' patient help filled with class feelings, he was so moved that he cried. He stood up to rebel and even voluntarily handed over the "important records." But when he was approved to join the revolutionary forces' organization, someone spread cold rumors behind his back, saying his confession was "fake," his transformation was too sudden, and so on. He heard this and his thoughts wavered again, his spirits sank, and he wanted to transfer his job. The revolutionary forces educated him to "face the wind and rain, see the world," endure tests, encouraged him to continue advancing and thoroughly rebel. Later, in several meetings to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, he launched a "counterattack," exposing many behind-the-scenes situations of the power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road in suppressing the revolution and directing the spearhead of struggle at the revolutionary forces, making many masses who were deceived and joined conservative organizations realize their mistakes, firmly draw a clear line with conservative organizations, and stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

3. **The Proletarian Revolutionary Forces Must Have the Great Bearing of "Liberating All Mankind" and Unite the Majority of the Masses in the Great Criticism of the Revolution.**

Chairman Mao teaches us: We must pay attention to uniting all those who can be united. We must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself. We believe that correctly handling conservative forces and uniting the majority is also a process in which the revolutionary forces actively study and apply the works of Chairman Mao, a process of thoroughly criticizing selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, realizing ideological transformation, and establishing the proletarian worldview of "liberating all mankind."

On the issue of how to correctly handle conservative forces, there was once fierce ideological struggle within the revolutionary forces. Some comrades were afraid of committing "rightist" errors and wanted to "long-term test" the masses who joined conservative organizations; some were afraid of getting close to them and being accused of "blurring class lines"; some, as soon as they heard their opinions, thought they were "attacks" and "counterattacks"; some comrades were afraid that after they were "liberated" and gained power, they would strike back at them in a few years and label them "counter-revolutionaries." In short, some revolutionary masses and cadres who had suffered persecution had not yet overcome their antagonistic feelings towards conservative forces. Later, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant works with problems in mind, gradually solved their ideological problems, and clearly realized that they should be good at uniting those who had opposed them and had been proven by practice to have made mistakes. The errors made by the masses who were deceived and joined conservative organizations are issues of understanding. A true proletarian revolutionary should have the great bearing of "liberating all mankind," actively approach them, and unite them. A worker from Beixinjing Farm who had suffered persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line said: "In the past, I hated those who had persecuted me, and I also wanted to persecute them to let them taste it. Now I realize that we are all class brothers and victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We should direct our greatest hatred at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and together settle accounts with this arch-criminal!"

Due to the continuous improvement of ideological understanding, correctly handling conservative organizations, the revolutionary forces gradually united the majority of the masses in the great criticism of the revolution. When the members of the Workers' Militia of Dongfeng Meat Factory realized their mistakes and stood up to rebel, the revolutionary forces posted big-character posters warmly welcoming them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Most of the comrades in the political department had participated in conservative organizations. They broke with the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the great criticism of the revolution and regained the trust of the revolutionary masses. In actual struggle, 70% of the masses in the political department were absorbed into the revolutionary forces' organization, strengthening the leftist forces and further isolating and striking at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

    正确对待保守组织
    上海工人革命造反总司令部市食品公司联络站
    毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”如何正确对待保守派，是团结群众大多数，组织起浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，孤立、打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一个重要问题。
    革命派应该如何正确对待保守派呢？我们的主要体会是：
    一、抓住主要矛盾，认清敌人，坚持斗争大方向。
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”今年《红旗》第七期评论员文章指出：“在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要解决的主要矛盾就是，无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。”我们正是按照毛主席的教导做的。我们始终抓住主要矛盾，认清主要敌人，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。我们始终没有把矛头指向保守派，而是在斗争中团结、教育、争取他们，共同对敌。
    在对待这个问题上，我们的认识是不断提高，不断明确的。今年初，正当资产阶级反动路线进行新反扑，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，我们食品公司的政治部门陷于瘫痪的时刻，公司革命派在伟大的“一月革命”风暴的推动下，通过针锋相对的斗争，接管了政治部门，勇敢地挑起了革命、生产两副重担。当时，革命派有些同志深切感受到资产阶级反动路线对党对国家对人民所造成的严重危害，对迟迟不起来造反的保守派非常不满，说“他们是铁杆老保”等等。革命派的几个负责同志同革命领导干部带着问题活学活用了《矛盾论》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》以及《红旗》有关社论，逐步统一了认识。毛主席教导我们：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”大家认识到：在文化大革命中，我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是主要矛盾，是敌我问题；同保守派的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，是次要问题。随后，大家又对当时政治部门比较保守的群众进行了阶级分析，认为他们一般都是出身于劳动人民，过去表现一贯较好，是热爱党，热爱毛主席的，但是由于他们受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，参加了保守组织。我们应该帮助他们提高觉悟，促使他们站起来革命。一定要用发展的眼光看到他们的进步，不能把保守派看成是固定不变的；只要他们真正起来革命，就应该鼓励，应该欢迎，决不能采取惩罚、排斥的态度。
    领导核心的思想统一了，就组织全体队委学习有关文件，通过讨论，大多数队委同意上述看法，但有的同志思想还不通。于是我们又先后召开了队委扩大会、全体队员大会，认真学习毛主席著作，充分发扬大民主，连续两天展开了群众性的大辩论，终于统一了认识，正确地处理了同政治部门受蒙蔽群众的关系。
    毛主席说：“在一般情况下，人民内部的矛盾不是对抗性的。但是如果处理得不适当，或者失去警觉，麻痹大意，也可能发生对抗。”我们对犯过错误的群众组织，或坚持错误观点的保守组织，认真地进行了具体分析，区别对待。对受经济主义毒害比较深的群众组织提出不合理的经济福利要求，革命派坚决予以抵制，同他们辩论，教育他们破“私”立“公”，掌握斗争大方向；对他们积极参与揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的一切革命活动，则坚决加以支持。某些群众组织当时因不明真相，同社会上的非法组织挂过钩，我们不是不加分析一律打倒，而是根据实际情况，分别对待。我们把这类组织同非法组织严格区别开来，把极少数坚持错误的“头头”，同绝大多数受蒙蔽的群众区别开来。即使是这类组织的“头头”，只要他们对自己的错误不是坚持不改和屡教不改，也还是通过批判，允许他们改正错误，鼓励他们将功补过。对广大受蒙蔽的群众，则始终采取说服教育的方法。公司所属牛羊肉经营部的革命派，曾坚持要砸掉一个保守组织，后来通过学习毛主席著作，认识到：越砸越压，越加对立，砸来砸去只是国家财产受损失，砸不掉头脑里的“私”字。文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，对于错误的思想，必须采取说服的方法、辩论的方法才能解决。以后通过辩论、教育，这个组织的不少队员真正明白了自己组织的大方向错了，就自觉退出，主动起来革命，不少人还参加了革命派组织，从而壮大了左派队伍。
    二、坚定相信群众，坚持说服教育，启发保守派在斗争中自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    我们体会到，要正确对待保守派，必须牢记毛主席关于相信群众大多数的教导。实践证明，一时受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众，在斗争中能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    公司的革命派帮助参加保守组织的群众反复学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》开头的一段话：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”大家就联系思想，检查自己究竟存在哪些妨碍执行毛主席革命路线的非无产阶级思想。以后又通过反复学习“老三篇”和《红旗》有关社论，认识逐步提高了。熟肉经营部有位老工人开始受蒙蔽参加了赤卫队，还当了骨干。后来通过揭发批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人镇压群众、危害革命的滔天罪行，才大吃一惊，知道自己上了当。他退出了赤卫队，坚决站起来造反，还参加了革命派组织。
    对于那些顾虑较多，一时认识不清的群众，我们还注意做艰苦、细致的政治思想工作，耐心地启发他们自觉革命。公司里有个新入党的复员军人，过去一贯表现较好，这次运动中因受蒙蔽参加了保守组织，并且是主要负责人之一。后来他去北京“串连”，受到很深的教育，回来后想站起来造反，又怕革命派不相信，怕交出准备秋后算账的“大事记”要挨斗，等等，思想很苦闷。革命派战士和革命领导干部同他多次谈心，一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他提高对两条路线斗争的认识，提高阶级觉悟，启发他破“私”立“公”，自觉革命。他看到革命群众和革命领导干部充满阶级感情的耐心帮助，激动得痛哭了一场。他站起来造反了，而且主动交出了“大事记”。但当他被批准参加革命派组织的时候，有人背后刮冷风，说他的交代是“假的”，转变很突然等等，他听了思想上又有动摇，情绪低落，想调动工作。革命派又教育他要“经风雨，见世面”，经受考验，鼓励他继续前进、彻底革命。后来，他在几次揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的大会上杀了个“回马枪”，揭发了党内走资本主义道路当权派压制革命，把斗争矛头指向革命派的不少内幕情况，使很多受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众觉悟过来，坚决同保守组织划清界限，站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。
    三、无产阶级革命派要有“解放全人类”的伟大胸怀，在革命的大批判中团结群众大多数。
    毛主席教导我们：要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。我们认为正确对待保守派，团结大多数的过程，也就是革命派活学活用毛主席著作的过程，是大破“私”字，大立“公”字，实现思想革命化，树立“解放全人类”的无产阶级世界观的过程。
    在如何正确对待保守派的问题上，我们革命派内部曾有过激烈的思想斗争。有的同志怕犯“右倾”错误，对参加保守组织的群众要“长期考验”；有的怕接近他们后，被说是“阶级界限不清”；有的一听到他们提意见，就认为是“攻击”、“反扑”；有的同志怕他们“解放”了，得了势，过两年又会把自己打成“反革命”。总之有些受过迫害的革命群众、革命干部同保守派的对立情绪一时扭不过来。后来带着问题活学活用毛主席的有关著作，思想问题逐步解决，明确地认识到要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众所犯的错误，是认识问题。一个真正的无产阶级革命者，应该有“解放全人类”的伟大胸怀，主动接近他们，团结他们。北新泾饲养场的一个受过资产阶级反动路线迫害的工人说：“过去对整过自己的人，心中很恨，本来也想整整他们，让他们尝尝味道。现在认识到我们都是阶级兄弟，都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，我们应当把最大的仇恨集中到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上，一起向这个罪魁祸首算账！”
    由于思想认识的不断提高，正确对待保守组织，革命派在大批判中逐步团结了群众大多数。东风肉类厂的赤卫队队员认识到自己的错误，站起来革命的时候，革命派贴出大字报热烈欢迎他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。公司政治部门的同志绝大部分参加过保守组织，他们在革命的大批判中同资产阶级反动路线决裂，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派决裂，重新得到了革命群众的信任。在实际斗争中，政治部门有百分之七十的群众被吸收参加了革命派组织，壮大了左派队伍，进一步孤立和打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
