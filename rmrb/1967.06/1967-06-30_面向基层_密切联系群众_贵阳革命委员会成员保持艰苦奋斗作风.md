Members of the Guiyang Municipal Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings to be "servants of the people," have maintained the character of ordinary laborers. They have stepped out of their offices, maintained close ties with the masses, and gone deep into the revolutionary and production front lines. They have adopted a face-to-face leadership method, which has been warmly welcomed by everyone.

From the day the Guiyang Municipal Revolutionary Committee was established, its members have been determined to thoroughly eliminate all habits of being high and mighty, detached from the masses, and acting like officials and lords. They have truly become "servants of the people" who serve wholeheartedly and never leave the masses. Leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, after becoming committee members, have not left their original posts. Revolutionary leading cadres and military representatives often go deep into the masses and maintain close ties with them.

They have abolished the old habits of sitting in offices, making phone calls, reading documents, listening to reports, and signing documents that were prevalent in municipal organs in the past. When various offices report work to the Revolutionary Committee, except for a small number of thematic and typical materials, they all use oral forms. When the Revolutionary Committee assigns work to lower levels, it also avoids using document forms as much as possible.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee, except for leaving one or two people to handle daily work, all go directly to grassroots units. The staff of various offices do the same. After going down, they discover problems and use Chairman Mao's method of "holding investigation meetings" to listen to various opinions, carefully analyze and study them. When solving problems, they start from political and ideological aspects. If they can solve them, they solve them immediately; if they cannot solve them, they bring them back to the Revolutionary Committee for joint research and resolution. Some units under the financial and commercial system seized power, and many people reflected that it was a rightist seizure of power. At this time, the office staff immediately went down to understand the situation from various aspects and obtained a large amount of first-hand materials. After analysis, it was not a rightist seizure of power. The Revolutionary Committee, after hearing their report, sent committee members down to understand the situation. In the end, it was confirmed that it was a leftist seizure of power. Those who said it was a rightist seizure of power were mostly masses deceived by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. The Revolutionary Committee did patient political and ideological work for them, and most of them quickly woke up, thus strongly supporting the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. When solving problems, the comrades who went down insisted on consulting with the masses on every matter and following the mass line. When the Cultural Bureau established a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership group, the comrades who went down had different opinions from the revolutionary mass organizations in the bureau. They did not adopt the method of packaging and replacing everything themselves but let everyone fully express their opinions, engage in debates, and solve problems together. As a result, they reached a consensus, and the revolutionary masses also trusted this leadership group more. Because the comrades who went down faced the grassroots and served the grassroots, they thus strengthened their ties with the masses, promoted their own ideological revolutionization, and the Revolutionary Committee's prestige among the masses was even higher.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee do not seek luxury in their lives, do not compare wealth, and do not act like officials. They walk to and from work and do not ride in cars. When they go out to work, they walk or take public transportation as much as possible. The chairmen and vice-chairmen and committee members work with ordinary staff and do not occupy separate offices. When revolutionary masses have something to discuss with them, regardless of the time, they will respond as long as there is no special reason. They are with the masses, laughing and chatting, and addressing each other as "comrades." The old way of addressing with official titles has disappeared. No matter what activities are held in the organ, they actively participate. Because the members of the Revolutionary Committee have maintained a spirit of hard work and self-denial, the upper and lower levels, cadres and masses have become one.

The reason why this Revolutionary Committee can do this is fundamentally because they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taken the People's Liberation Army as an example, and actively applied Chairman Mao's works to promote ideological revolutionization. They have established a learning system. No matter whether it is a big or small meeting, they first study Chairman Mao's relevant statements. They insist on the "Daily Reading" institution for the first hour of the morning shift every day, ensuring that learning is not squeezed out even when work is busy and tasks are tight.

### 面向基层　密切联系群众  贵阳革命委员会成员保持艰苦奋斗作风

    面向基层　密切联系群众
    贵阳革命委员会成员保持艰苦奋斗作风
    本报讯　贵阳市革命委员会成员，遵循着毛主席做“人民的勤务员”的教导，保持普通劳动者的本色，走出办公室，密切联系群众，深入革命、生产第一线，采取面对面的领导方法，深受大家欢迎。
    贵阳市革委会成员从革委会成立那天起，就决心彻底扫除一切高高在上、脱离群众、做官当老爷的坏作风，真正成为“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的勤务员。革命群众组织负责人当了委员以后，一直没有脱离原来岗位。革命领导干部、军代表，经常深入下去，和广大群众保持密切联系。
    他们废除了过去市的机关那种光坐在办公室打电话、看文件、听汇报、批公文等老爷习气。各办公室向革委会汇报工作，除少量的专题和典型材料外，都采用口头形式。革委会向下布置工作，也尽量避免采用文件形式。
    革委会成员，每天除留下一两个人处理日常工作外，其他成员都直接到基层单位去。各办公室的工作人员也是一样。他们下去以后，发现问题，就运用毛主席的“开调查会”的方法，倾听各种意见，仔细分析研究。处理问题，首先从政治思想入手，能解决的，就及时解决；解决不了的，带回革委会共同研究解决。财贸系统所属有些单位夺权以后，许多人反映是右派夺权。这时，办公室的同志立即下去，从各方面了解情况，获得了大量的第一手材料，经过分析，并非右派夺权。革委会听了他们的汇报以后，又派委员下去了解情况，最后肯定是左派夺权。那些说是右派夺权的人，绝大多数是受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派蒙蔽的群众。革委会向他们进行了耐心的政治思想工作，使绝大多数的人迅速醒悟过来，从而有力地支持了无产阶级革命派。在解决问题时，下去的同志坚持遇事同群众商量，走群众路线。文化局建立革命的“三结合”班子时，下去的同志同局里的革命群众组织意见有了分歧。他们不是采取自己说了算的包办代替的做法，而是让大家充分发表意见，展开辩论，共同解决。结果，统一了认识，革命群众对这个班子也更加信任。由于下去的同志面向基层，为基层服务，因而密切了同群众的关系，促进了自己的思想革命化，革委会在群众中的威信也更高。
    革委会成员在生活上不讲排场，不比阔气，不摆官架子。他们步行上下班，不坐小汽车。外出工作，也尽量步行或乘公共汽车。正副主任和委员同一般工作人员一起办公，不单独占用办公室。革命群众有事要向他们面谈，不管什么时候，如无特殊原因，都有求必应。他们和群众在一起，有说有笑，彼此以“同志”相称，过去带官衔的称呼没有了。机关里不管有什么活动，他们都积极主动参加。由于革委会成员保持了艰苦奋斗作风，因而上级和下级、干部和群众打成了一片。
    这个革委会所以能够做到这样，最根本的原因是他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。他们建立了学习制度，不管开大小会，都先学习毛主席有关论述；坚持每天上午上班的第一个小时的“天天读”制度，做到了工作再忙、任务再紧，学习也挤不掉。
