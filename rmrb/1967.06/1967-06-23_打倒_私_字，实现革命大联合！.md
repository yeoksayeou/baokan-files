	"In June, the heavenly troops march to vanquish evil, with a ten-thousand-foot rope to bind the roc." Today, amidst the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the revolutionary masses of the capital's institutions of higher learning, have gathered to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." This is a significant event of great importance, a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	In his great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao teaches us: "Before us are two types of social contradictions: those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people. These are contradictions of a completely different nature." "The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic contradictions." "Generally speaking, contradictions among the people are contradictions in the midst of fundamental common interests." Therefore, in dealing with these two types of contradictions, we must not confuse contradictions between ourselves and the enemy with those among the people, nor turn contradictions among the people into those between ourselves and the enemy. Without this understanding, one deviates from Mao Zedong Thought; without this understanding, one deviates from the direction of the struggle.

	Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved decisive victories. However, serious class struggles still lie before us. We must thoroughly criticize, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. At the same time, we must gradually proceed with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our own units. The task is arduous. Renmin University has been one of the units directly controlled by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the Peng Zhen anti-revolutionary revisionist clique. For more than a decade, it has not truly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line but has instead implemented the reactionary bourgeois line of the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, becoming a stronghold for the spread of bourgeois and revisionist ideas.

	During the Cultural Revolution, for a period of time, due to our failure to study Chairman Mao's works well, the two revolutionary organizations in our school have not yet united well. Recently, through studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work, the broad masses of the two revolutionary organizations—Ren Da Sanhong and Xin Ren Da Gongshe—have deeply understood that at this stage of the movement, whether or not the revolutionary masses unite is a crucial indicator of whether an organization acts according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Achieving the great unity of the revolutionary masses and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle is the greatest "yes," otherwise, it is the greatest "no." Through the active efforts of the broad masses of Ren Da Sanhong and Xin Ren Da Gongshe, a good beginning has been made in the Renmin University campus for the two revolutionary organizations to unite against the enemy. We have jointly struggled against the power-holders taking the capitalist road within our school on two occasions. On June 19, we jointly held a "Most Solemn Commemoration Meeting for the Tenth Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Brilliant Work 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'." The broad masses of the two revolutionary organizations are increasingly eager and determined to unite immediately and jointly fight against the enemy! The situation for united struggle is getting better and better!

	We will definitely unite because we have a common guiding ideology, which is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	We will definitely unite because our direction is the same, and our struggle targets are common!

	Although we still have some differences now, this is a normal phenomenon, and these contradictions are all among the people. Chairman Mao said: "All contradictions of a ideological nature and all contradictions among the people should be resolved by democratic methods, by the method of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not by the method of compulsion or of suppressing one side." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to correctly resolve the differences among us!

	To achieve the great unity of the two revolutionary organizations in our school—Ren Da Sanhong and Xin Ren Da Gongshe—we must thoroughly study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work, overthrow the "self" character, and carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation. At present, most intellectuals cannot be said to have completed this transformation." Therefore, we need to conduct rectification frequently, carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome sectarianism, overcome anarchism, overcome small-groupism, overcome individualism, and other non-proletarian thoughts.

	We believe that as long as we firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles we encounter on the road ahead, we will definitely unite, make our due contributions in the great criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own units!

    打倒“私”字，实现革命大联合！
    中国人民大学  人大三红  新人大公社
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”今天，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，我们，首都大专院校的无产阶级革命派聚集一堂，纪念毛主席的伟大著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年，这是一件有重大意义的大事情，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部伟大的著作中，教导我们：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”“敌我之间的矛盾是对抗性的矛盾。”“一般说来，人民内部的矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾。”因此，在对待两类不同性质的矛盾问题上，决不能把敌我矛盾当成人民内部矛盾，也决不能把人民内部矛盾搞成敌我矛盾。离开了这一点，就违背了毛泽东思想，离开了这一点，就违背了斗争大方向。
    现在，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是，严重的阶级斗争还摆在面前。我们要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。与此同时，还要逐步地转入本单位的斗批改。任务是艰巨的。我们人民大学是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团直接插手控制的单位之一。十几年来，一直没有真正贯彻、执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，而执行了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线，成了贩卖资产阶级思想、修正主义思想的一个阵地。
    在文化大革命中，在一段时间内，由于我们没有学好毛主席著作，我校两大革命组织至今还没有很好地联合起来。最近，我校两大革命组织——人大三红和新人大公社的广大战士，通过学习毛主席这一光辉著作，深深懂得了运动发展到今天，要不要革命派的大联合，是衡量一个组织能不能按照毛主席教导办事的一个重要标志。实现革命派的大联合，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，就是最大的“是”，否则，就是最大的“非”。经过人大三红和新人大公社广大战士的积极努力，在人大校园已经出现了两大革命组织联合对敌的良好开端，我们先后两次联合斗争了我校党内走资本主义道路当权派。我们又在六月十九日，联合召开了“最最隆重纪念毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年大会”。两大革命组织的广大战士要求立即联合起来，共同对敌的愿望越来越迫切，越来越强烈！联合对敌的形势越来越好！
    我们一定能够联合起来，因为我们有着共同的指导思想，这就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    我们一定能够联合起来，因为我们的方向是一致的，斗争目标是共同的！
    尽管我们现在还存在着这样或那样的分歧，但是，这是正常的现象，这些矛盾都是属于人民内部矛盾。毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”我们一定按照毛主席的教导，用“团结——批评——团结”的公式来正确消除我们之间存在的分歧！
    为了实现我校两大革命组织——人大三红和新人大公社的大联合，我们一定要活学活用毛主席这篇光辉著作，打倒“私”字，在灵魂深处闹革命。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。”因此，我们需要经常整风，进行批评和自我批评，打倒宗派主义，打倒无政府主义，打倒小团体主义，打倒个人主义等各种非无产阶级思想。
    我们相信，只要我们坚定不移地按照毛主席的教导办事，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，不管在前进的道路上遇到多少艰难险阻、惊涛骇浪，我们一定能够联合起来，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，在完成本单位的斗、批、改的任务中作出我们应有的贡献！
