The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram today to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Unions Council, addressed to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Organizations' Committee Against British Oppression, extending the highest revolutionary combat salute and warmest, most heartfelt greetings to the heroic patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon and the working-class brothers. The telegram also announced the remittance of HK$10 million to support the patriotic struggle against oppression in Hong Kong.

The telegram stated that British imperialism has recently carried out large-scale, bloody fascist atrocities against the patriotic people of Hong Kong. The working-class brothers across the nation will not stand idly by as our class brothers suffer from the brutal oppression of British imperialism. The working-class brothers across the nation vow to be your steadfast backbone, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fighting the anti-imperialist, anti-oppression struggle to the end.

The telegram further stated, "Patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, working-class brothers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, engage in resolute struggle against the stubborn and decaying British imperialism, and make them suffer a crushing defeat in the face of your counterattack!"
