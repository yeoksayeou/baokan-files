In the midst of the nationwide celebration by revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people of the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and at the crucial moment of launching a general offensive against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the book "Five Documents by Chairman Mao on Literature and Art" will be published in the capital starting June 1. This is a joyous event that inspires the people.

Our great, great, and truly great leader Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art are: "Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe After Watching 'The Story of the Forced Marriage,'" "We Should Pay Attention to the Discussion on the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" "Letter on the Question of Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" and "Two Directives on Literature and Art." These five documents creatively develop Marxist-Leninist literary theory and creatively develop Marxist-Leninist theory on class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They serve as a guide to defeating the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes' ideology, developing socialist literature and art, preventing revisionist elements from usurping the Party and the state, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are programmatic documents of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents on literature and art in newspapers, revolutionary masses, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary literary and art workers across the country were all inspired and enthusiastic. With boundless love, admiration, respect, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they eagerly awaited the publication of these five documents in booklet form.

To meet the demands of the broad revolutionary masses, the People's Publishing House and the revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Plant jointly organized the printing and publication. They regarded the publication of "Five Documents by Chairman Mao on Literature and Art" as the most glorious and great political task. They displayed a spirit of bravery, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting, working and fighting minute by minute, second by second. In just a few days, they printed a large number of red booklets. This book will soon be published in various places across the country.
