	Editor's Note: The following are two letters from readers that raise important issues for the current summer harvest.

	This year, the summer grain crops across the country are expected to yield a bumper harvest. At this time of plenty, some people might not care about losing a grain or two, thinking it is a trivial matter. They do not understand the principle of accumulation. Dropping a few grains per ear means losing several pounds per acre, and for a production team, this can amount to several hundred pounds. Therefore, this is not a small matter but a big deal related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." It is a matter of great significance for the Cultural Revolution.

	Revolutionary masses and cadres in rural areas across the country should, during the current summer harvest, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and "practice thrift and oppose waste." The more bountiful the harvest, the more we must practice thrift, ensuring that every grain is collected and stored.

### 要节约闹革命

    要节约闹革命
    编者按：下面发表的两封读者来信，提出了当前夏收中值得重视的问题。
      今年全国夏粮作物将是一个大丰收。在丰收之际，有些人可能对丢掉一粒两粒粮食满不在乎，认为是小事。他们不知道聚少成多的道理。一棵穗丢几粒粮，一亩地就是几斤粮，一个生产队就是几百斤粮。因此这决不是小事，而是关系“备战、备荒、为人民”的大事，关系到文化大革命的大事。
      各地农村的广大革命群众和革命干部，在当前夏收中，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，“厉行节约，反对浪费”。越是丰收，越要节约，把快要到手的粮食，全部收回来，颗粒归仓。
