The Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin held talks with the U.S. imperialist head Johnson on the 23rd in Glassboro, New Jersey. This is the third time in recent years that the U.S. imperialist and Soviet revisionist leaders have sat together to directly plot a global counter-revolutionary conspiracy.

The Davos Camp Talks

The infamous Davos Camp talks were the first meeting between Khrushchev and the U.S. imperialist leader. Khrushchev visited the United States from September 15 to 27, 1959, for thirteen days. During this period, from the 25th to the 27th, Khrushchev and then U.S. imperialist head Eisenhower held three days of talks at the U.S. presidential retreat, Davos Camp, about 100 kilometers from Washington. During this period, Khrushchev extensively praised the war-mongering Eisenhower, applying lipstick to the U.S. imperialists. He praised Eisenhower as "wise," "absolutely trusted by his own people," and "concerned about maintaining peace." In the Davos Camp talks, he actively promoted the revisionist foreign policy line of "peaceful coexistence," betraying the interests of the Soviet people and the world's revolutionary people. He and Eisenhower conducted a series of political deals on issues such as Germany, Berlin, disarmament, and Soviet-U.S. relations.

The Davos Camp talks were also a major step in the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with the U.S. to oppose China. Before Khrushchev's visit to the U.S., the Soviet revisionist leadership unilaterally tore up the Sino-Soviet agreement on defense technology in June 1959; then, on September 9, they issued a Tass statement on the Sino-Indian border incident, siding with the Indian reactionaries. These were all gifts from the Soviet revisionist leadership to Eisenhower to create the so-called "Davos spirit" to curry favor with U.S. imperialism.

After this meeting, the Soviet revisionist leadership's pace of collusion with U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the revolutionary interests of the world's people accelerated greatly.

The Vienna Talks

On June 3 and 4, 1961, Khrushchev held talks with Kennedy, who had succeeded Eisenhower as U.S. President, in Vienna, the capital of Austria.

Since Kennedy succeeded Eisenhower as U.S. President, Khrushchev, in order to push for "U.S.-Soviet cooperation," even more enthusiastically praised U.S. imperialism, praising Kennedy as someone who could better shoulder the responsibility of "maintaining world peace" than Eisenhower. He shamelessly praised this U.S. imperialist head as "showing concern for maintaining peace," claiming that one could expect Kennedy to "create reliable conditions for peaceful life and creative labor on Earth." In the Vienna talks, Khrushchev and Kennedy conducted even larger global political deals, "broadly discussing issues related to Soviet-U.S. relations and the world situation," and in a joint statement, they announced that they decided to "maintain contact on all issues concerning the two countries and the entire world." At that time, the expanded Geneva Conference on Laos was in session, and Khrushchev, in the talks, betrayed the revolutionary interests of the Lao people, openly supporting U.S. imperialism's plot to sabotage the Geneva Conference and intensify its interference in Laos, acknowledging the importance of an "effective ceasefire" in Laos.

The Vienna talks further accelerated U.S.-Soviet "cooperation," intensifying their evil collusion to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

"The U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" is the core of Khrushchev's revisionist line. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they have been even more ruthlessly pushing this counter-revolutionary line. Now Kosygin is holding talks with Johnson, conducting unprecedented large-scale global political deals. This will further expose the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

    美帝苏修头目的两次反革命勾搭
    苏修头目柯西金二十三日同美帝国主义头子约翰逊在美国新泽西州的葛拉斯堡罗举行会谈。这是近几年来美帝苏修头目第三次坐在一起直接密谋全球性的反革命大勾结。
    戴维营会谈
    臭名远扬的戴维营会谈，是赫鲁晓夫与美帝国主义头目举行的第一次会谈。赫鲁晓夫在一九五九年九月十五日到二十七日到美国访问了十三天。其间，从二十五日到二十七日，赫鲁晓夫和当时的美帝头子艾森豪威尔在离华盛顿一百公里的美国总统别墅戴维营，举行了三天的会谈。赫鲁晓夫在这个期间，大肆美化战争贩子艾森豪威尔，为美帝国主义者涂脂抹粉。他吹捧艾森豪威尔“明智”，“得到本国人民绝对信任”，“为保障和平而操心”。在戴维营会谈中，他积极推行“和平共处”的修正主义对外政策总路线，叛卖苏联人民和世界革命人民的利益。他和艾森豪威尔就德国问题、柏林问题、裁军问题和苏美关系等问题，进行了一系列的政治交易。
    戴维营会谈也是苏联修正主义领导集团联美反华的一个重大步骤。在赫鲁晓夫访美前夕，苏修领导集团在一九五九年六月片面撕毁中苏关于国防技术方面的协定；随后在九月九日，又发表了塔斯社关于中印边境事件的声明，偏袒印度反动派。这些都是苏修领导集团为了讨好美帝国主义，创造所谓“戴维营精神”，送给艾森豪威尔的见面礼。
    在这次会谈后，苏修领导集团同美帝国主义勾结，出卖世界人民革命利益的步伐便大大地加快了。
    维也纳会谈
    一九六一年六月三日和四日，赫鲁晓夫又在奥地利首都维也纳，同接替艾森豪威尔的美帝总统肯尼迪举行了会谈。
    自从肯尼迪继艾森豪威尔当上美国总统以后，赫鲁晓夫为了大搞“美苏合作”，更加起劲地美化美帝国主义，把肯尼迪吹捧成比艾森豪威尔更能承担起“维持世界和平”的责任的人，无耻吹捧这个美帝头子“表现出对维护和平的关怀”，胡说什么可以期待肯尼迪“来为地球上的和平生活和创造性劳动保证可靠的条件”。在维也纳会谈中，赫鲁晓夫和肯尼迪进行了更大的全球性的政治交易，“广泛地讨论了有关苏美关系和世界局势的问题”，并且在联合声明中宣布，他们决定就“两国以及同全世界有关的一切问题保持接触”。当时，关于老挝问题的扩大的日内瓦会议正在举行，赫鲁晓夫在会谈中叛卖老挝人民的革命利益，公然在联合声明中支持美帝国主义破坏日内瓦会议、加紧干涉老挝的所谓实现“有效停火”的阴谋，“承认在老挝有效停火的重要性”。
    维也纳会谈进一步加速了美苏的“合作”，加紧了它们扼杀各国人民革命斗争的罪恶勾当。
    “苏美合作主宰世界”是赫鲁晓夫修正主义总路线的核心。勃列日涅夫和柯西金上台之后，一直在变本加厉地推行这条反革命路线。现在柯西金又同约翰逊会谈，搞空前规模的全球性政治交易。这必将更加彻底地暴露苏联修正主义领导集团的叛徒嘴脸。　（据新华社讯）
