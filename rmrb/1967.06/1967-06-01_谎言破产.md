The storm of the "January Revolution" swept through Shanghai along the Huangpu River, surging and roaring, sweeping across the nation and shaking the world. We, the proletarian revolutionaries, riding the cultural revolution's east wind, bravely battled against the black waves of counter-revolutionary economism, fighting fiercely and sweeping away all obstacles. We firmly seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that had been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

We proletarian revolutionaries resolutely respond to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, and vigorously promote revolution and production. The situation on both the revolutionary and production fronts is excellent!

"Joy in a thousand homes, sorrow in a few!" The revolutionary people of the world are celebrating the victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, however, are terrified and wailing in despair. The mouthpiece of American imperialism, the *New York Times*, and the propaganda machine of the Soviet revisionists, *Izvestia*, sing in unison, spreading lies that China's Cultural Revolution "seriously damages production efficiency," that China is facing "even greater difficulties," and so on. The head of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Kosygin, can't hold back any longer and jumps into the fray, shouting that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution "inevitably leads to economic collapse," and so forth. What nonsense!

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed and formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to revolutionize people's ideology, thereby making all work done better, faster, and more economically. ... The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country."

"A drop of water reflects the sun." Look at our factory! Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant is an old factory with a history of decades of anti-imperialist struggle. Although the factory has undergone significant changes since liberation over a decade ago, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line in certain areas, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad revolutionary masses have not been fully unleashed. Suddenly, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept through with unparalleled speed. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers in our factory, with "daring" as our motto, launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, seized their power, and bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. We broke through the various foreign frameworks and dogmas of capitalism and revisionism, one by one, and "killed" our way to a new path. We quickly established a series of more rational and scientific new parameters for electrical equipment. The wisdom and creativity of the workers were fully unleashed, and the potential of the old equipment was greatly enhanced. As a result, the main production indicators of the entire factory have reached new heights, surpassing the highest levels since the factory was established. In a short period, our factory's power generation capacity increased by 10% compared to the original level. The coal consumption in the first quarter also dropped to the lowest level in history. Due to the spirit of revolutionary rebellion and the spirit of communism, we have successfully completed the electric machine overhaul task two and a half days ahead of schedule, providing strong support for Shanghai's industrial and agricultural power needs.

Listen, gentlemen of the American and Soviet revisionists, you will never understand the hearts of the proletarian revolutionaries. In your minds, money is the root of all things. Human factors and roles are entirely determined by dollars and rubles. For you, it is unimaginable to develop production without "material incentives." However, contrary to the capitalist road you take, we rely on the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, on the revolutionization of people's ideology, and on maximizing the role of human factors.

You, the Soviet revisionist gentlemen, who sing in unison with the Americans, actually, the ones who "seriously damage production efficiency," "exhaust the state," and "inevitably lead to economic collapse," making "life worse and worse," are none other than yourselves. No matter how much you rely on "material incentives" or the ruble, it will not make your predicament any better. In recent years, the Soviet revisionists, in order to accelerate the restoration of capitalism, have vigorously promoted the so-called "new economic system" with profits and rubles as the banner, resulting in the gradual dismantling of the socialist collective economy in the Soviet Union, and the productive forces being increasingly damaged. Look at your own official documents—the report by the Soviet Central Statistical Bureau on the results of the 1966 national plan execution. This self-deceiving report, after puffing itself up, still has to admit, stammering, that in the Soviet Union, "11% of enterprises did not complete the tasks set by the plan." In fact, your problems go far beyond this.

Soviet revisionist gentlemen: You, along with American imperialism, maliciously attack our Cultural Revolution, distorting right and wrong, spreading lies, and deceiving the people, precisely because you are extremely afraid of the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, inspiring the Soviet people to rebel against you. You cannot erase the glorious example of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, so you create the myth of "China's production efficiency declining" to deceive and frighten the Soviet people. But lies are bound to collapse. Once the people know the truth and see the light, your "throne" will surely crumble faster.

The wheels of history are rolling forward. You traitors, who rely on lies to get by, are doomed to complete failure!

    谎言破产
    上海杨树浦发电厂革命造反队战士
    “一月革命”的风暴，在上海黄浦江边掀起，奔腾澎湃，席卷全国，震动世界。我们无产阶级革命派，乘文化大革命的东风，破反革命经济主义的黑浪，勇猛奋战，摧枯拉朽，把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所篡夺了的党政财文大权，牢牢夺回自己手里。
    我们无产阶级革命派坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命、生产两条战线，形势一片大好！
    “万家欢乐几家愁”！全世界革命人民为我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展而欢呼。帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派却惊恐万状，怕得要死，发出一片咒骂和哀鸣。美帝国主义的喉舌《纽约时报》和苏修的宣传机器《消息报》等，一唱一和，大肆造谣，说什么中国的文化大革命“使生产效率受到严重破坏”啦，中国面临“更严重的困难”啦。苏修领导集团的头头柯西金也按捺不住，赤膊上阵，叫嚷中国的无产阶级文化大革命“不可避免地要导致经济破产”，等等。这真是一派胡言！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持和制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。……无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”
    “一滴水可以反映出太阳”。看看我们工厂吧！我们上海杨树浦发电厂是一个有几十年反帝斗争历史的老厂。尽管解放十多年来，全厂面貌有了很大的改变，但是，由于某些方面仍然受到资产阶级反动路线的影响，广大革命职工的积极性和创造性，依然没有得到充分的发挥。平地一声雷。无产阶级文化大革命，以无比迅猛之势展开了。我厂无产阶级革命派和革命职工，“敢”字当头，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，夺了他们的权，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，把资本主义、修正主义的各种洋框框、洋教条，一个个冲破，“杀”出了一条新路，迅速地建立了一系列更加合理、更加科学的发电设备的新参数。工人的聪明才智充分发挥出来了，老设备的潜力大大地提高了，从而使全厂主要生产指标出现了新的高涨，分别达到或超过了建厂以来的最高水平。在短短时间内，我厂发电能力就比原有水平提高了百分之十。第一季度煤耗量也下降到历史最低水平。由于发扬了革命造反精神，发扬了一心为公的共产主义精神，我们终于在高质量的基础上，提前两天半出色地完成了电机检修任务，有力地支援了上海市工农业用电的需要。
    美帝和苏修的老爷们听着，我们无产阶级革命派的胸怀，你们是绝对理解不了的。在你们的脑袋里，钱，是命根子。人的因素和作用，完全为美元和卢布来决定。对于你们来说，不靠“物质刺激”而想使生产获得发展，是无法想象的。但是，与你们所走的资本主义的道路相反，我们依靠的是光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是人的思想革命化，是最大程度地发挥人的因素的作用。
    与美帝一唱一和的苏修老爷们，其实，真正“使生产效率受到严重破坏”，“使国家衰竭不堪”，“不可避免地要导致经济破产”，“日子愈来愈不好过的”不是别人，正是你们自己。不管你们“物质刺激”也好，卢布挂帅也好，丝毫不能使你们面临的困境更好一些。几年来苏修为了加快资本主义复辟，大力推行了以利润、卢布挂帅的所谓“新经济体制”，结果已使苏联的社会主义集体经济一步步瓦解，生产力受到愈来愈大的破坏。翻翻你们自己的官样文章——苏联中央统计局关于一九六六年国家计划执行结果的公报吧！这份自欺欺人的公报，在打肿了脸充胖子之后，也不得不吞吞吐吐地承认，在苏联“有百分之十一的企业没有完成计划所规定的任务”。其实，你们的问题何止这些。
    苏修老爷们：你们跟美帝国主义一个腔调，对我国文化大革命进行恶毒攻击，颠倒黑白，造谣惑众，正是因为你们极端害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，鼓舞苏联人民起来造你们的反。你们抹杀不了我国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉范例，于是就制造出中国“生产效率下降”这类神话来蒙骗和吓唬苏联人民。但是，谎言终究是要破产的。一旦人民了解了真相，认清了真理，你们的“宝座”，肯定只会加快地倒塌。
    历史的车轮在飞奔向前。你们这些依靠撒谎来混日子的叛徒注定要彻底完蛋！
