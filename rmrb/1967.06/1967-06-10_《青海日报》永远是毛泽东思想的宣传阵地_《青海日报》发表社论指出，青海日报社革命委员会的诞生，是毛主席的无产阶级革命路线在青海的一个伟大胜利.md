To celebrate the birth of the Qinghai Daily Revolutionary Committee, the Qinghai Daily published an editorial on June 2 titled "Make the Qinghai Daily a Strong Bastion for the Propagation of Mao Zedong Thought."

The editorial pointed out that the birth of the Qinghai Daily Revolutionary Committee is a triumphant song of the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in Qinghai, and a significant achievement of the Qinghai proletarian revolutionary faction in raising the banner of revolution, uniting and fighting, and persevering in the struggle!

The editorial said: The establishment of the Qinghai Daily Revolutionary Committee is an important sign of the decisive victory in the struggle against the restoration of capitalism under the dictatorship of the proletariat in Qinghai Province, and an important sign of the entry of the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province into the stage of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination for seizing power.

The editorial said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a government, public opinion must first be created, and ideological work must first be done. This is true for revolutionary classes and counter-revolutionary classes alike." This is a scientific summary of the history of class struggle at home and abroad, ancient and modern, and an unbreakable truth.

The editorial went on to say that for a long time, a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the newspaper have been trying to control the Qinghai Daily, attempting to change its nature as a proletarian newspaper and turn it into a tool for preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Under the control of this small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, the Qinghai Daily once degenerated into a frontline position for demons and monsters to launch savage attacks on the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Especially after Chairman Mao personally ignited the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the struggle for the Qinghai Daily intensified. The Provincial Party Committee and the newspaper's handful of authorities taking the capitalist road, in order to save their doomed fate, adopted the tactic of attacking to defend, sparing no effort to tighten their control over the Qinghai Daily, and ruthlessly suppressing the revolutionary mass movement within the newspaper. They attempted to extinguish the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat sweeping across the province and reverse the historical wheel of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. When the red storm of the "January Revolution" swept across the country, the struggle for seizing power and counter-seizing power at the Qinghai Daily became extremely sharp and intense. This struggle was not just about the gain or loss of this position, but also about who would win or lose in the struggle between restoration and anti-restoration across the province. In this struggle, the August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai, under the intimate care and strong support of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, defeated the counter-revolutionary restorationist tide of the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly seized back the Qinghai Daily from the hands of the handful of authorities taking the capitalist road within the Party, firmly grasping this important propaganda position.

The editorial said: Now, the Qinghai Daily is firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The Qinghai Daily has become a revolutionary and fighting propaganda position of the proletariat. We—the revolutionary staff of the Qinghai Daily—will forever defend this position and contribute everything we have to defending and strengthening this position. We—the revolutionary staff of the Qinghai Daily—will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and make the Qinghai Daily a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and a powerful weapon for the proletariat to engage in political struggle and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    《青海日报》永远是毛泽东思想的宣传阵地
    《青海日报》发表社论指出，青海日报社革命委员会的诞生，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在青海的一个伟大胜利
    新华社西宁九日电  为庆祝青海日报社革命委员会诞生，《青海日报》六月二日发表了题为《把〈青海日报〉办成宣传毛泽东思想的坚强阵地》的社论。
    社论指出，青海日报社革命委员会的诞生，是光焰无际、威力无穷的毛泽东思想的一曲振奋人心的凯歌，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在青海的一个伟大胜利，是青海省无产阶级革命派高举革命造反大旗，团结战斗、坚持斗争所获得的重大成果！
    社论说：青海日报社革命委员会的成立，是青海省在无产阶级专政下，在反对资本主义复辟的斗争中取得决定性胜利的重要标志之一，是青海省无产阶级文化大革命进入革命大联合、革命“三结合”的夺权阶段的重要标志之一。
    社论说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”这是中外古今一切阶级斗争的科学的历史总结，是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    社论接着谈到，长期以来，青海省委和报社内部的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，竭力控制《青海日报》，企图改变它的无产阶级报纸的性质，把它变成为复辟资本主义准备舆论的工具。在这一小撮反革命修正主义分子把持下，《青海日报》一度堕落成牛鬼蛇神向党、向社会主义、向毛泽东思想猖狂进攻的前哨阵地。特别是在毛主席亲自点燃无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火以后，争夺《青海日报》的斗争，空前加剧了。省委和报社内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了挽救他们彻底覆灭的命运，采取了以攻为守的手段，不遗余力地加紧对《青海日报》的控制，残酷地镇压报社内部革命的群众运动。他们妄图通过对报纸的控制，扑灭席卷全省无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，扭转无产阶级文化大革命的历史车轮。当“一月革命”的红色风暴席卷全国的时候，《青海日报》的夺权和反夺权的斗争，十分尖锐、十分剧烈地开展起来了。这场斗争，不光是《青海日报》这个阵地的得失问题，而且是全省范围内复辟和反复辟斗争中谁胜谁负的关键。在这场斗争中，青海省“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派，在毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀和大力支持下，打垮了资产阶级反革命复辟的逆流，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里彻底夺回了《青海日报》，牢牢地掌握了这个重要的宣传阵地。
    社论说：现在，《青海日报》已牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，《青海日报》已成为无产阶级的革命的战斗的宣传阵地。我们——青海日报社的革命职工，将永远坚守阵地，为捍卫和强化这个阵地贡献出我们的一切。我们——青海日报社的革命职工，将永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把《青海日报》办成毛泽东思想的大学校，办成无产阶级进行政治斗争、加强无产阶级专政的强有力的武器。
