Arab and African countries' masses and public opinion strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique for openly colluding with American and British imperialism to concoct a "ceasefire resolution" at the United Nations to extinguish the Arab people's anger against aggression, and for their shameful act of betraying the Arab people's anti-imperialist cause.

The people of Yemen are extremely indignant at the Soviet revisionists' crime of betraying the Arab people's anti-imperialist cause. They point out that the Arab people have come to realize through the Middle East events: the Soviet Union is not a friend of the Arab people; it has betrayed the Arab people. A Yemeni youth said, "The Soviet Union is a traitor who sells out the interests of the Arab people."

A Yemeni friend named Hassan Muhammad angrily told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "At the critical moment when the Arab people are facing aggression by the U.S.-Israel, the Soviet Union not only does not support us, but instead stabs us in the back. The Soviet Union is truly despicable. Now we have seen clearly that the Soviet Union is playing double-dealing tricks, pretending to support us while actually selling us out."

Another Yemeni friend said: "The Soviet Union is the same as the United States. Now we do not need such 'friends' as the Soviet Union. We want the Soviet Union and the United States to both get out!"

An Arab friend residing in Yemen said: "The Soviet Union is not our friend, but the friend of our enemies."

He pointed out: "When the United States and Israel launched aggression against the Arab people, the Soviet Union did not support us, but instead, colluded with the United States to pressure Arab countries and push for a 'ceasefire'..."

The Iraqi newspaper *Voice of the Arabs* on the 9th exposed the Soviet revisionist clique's treachery against the Arab people, stating: "This country, which people thought was a friend, had promised to aid the Arab people, but when it was time to fulfill its obligations, it acted like an enemy." The newspaper angrily told the Soviet revisionist clique: "We will no longer ask you for anything. The struggle against Israel is a struggle of one hundred million people... You have given us a lesson we will never forget."

The editor of the Egyptian weekly *Today's News*, Muhammad Tabi, published an article on the 10th condemning the Soviet revisionists' refusal to aid the Arab people in resisting the military aggression of American and British imperialism and their lackey Israel against Arab countries. The article said: "A certain great power is considered our friend and should have supported us in resisting the new tripartite aggression." However, "the leaders of this country are satisfied only with holding talks with the Tel Aviv government..."

The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Ra'y Al-Amm* on the 9th published a commentary stating that the "ceasefire resolution" plotted by the Soviet revisionist clique in collusion with American and British imperialism is aimed at putting the Arab people to death. It said: "We will not lay down our arms, whether Khrushchev likes it or not."

The newspaper *New Sudan* in an article condemned the Soviet revisionist clique, saying: "Your position is shameful... Those who run away at the time of crisis are our enemies... The worst enemies."

The radio station "Voice of the Revolution" in Guinea and the newspaper *Nationalist* in Tanzania published commentaries on the 7th and 9th, respectively, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the Arab people's anti-imperialist cause. They emphasized that the only way out for the Arab people is to carry the just war of resistance to the end!

    阿拉伯和非洲公众舆论怒斥苏修集团假支持真出卖的叛卖行为
    美帝苏修一起滚出中东去！
    据新华社十日讯　阿拉伯和非洲国家群众和舆论强烈谴责苏修统治集团，公然同美英帝国主义串通一气，在联合国炮制“停火决议”来扑灭阿拉伯人民反抗侵略的怒火，出卖阿拉伯人民反帝事业的可耻行径。
    也门人民对苏修叛卖阿拉伯人民反帝事业的罪恶行为感到极大的愤慨。他们指出，阿拉伯人民通过中东事件认识到：苏联不是阿拉伯人民的朋友，它已经背叛了阿拉伯人民。一位也门青年说，苏联是出卖阿拉伯人民利益的叛徒。
    一位名叫哈桑·穆罕默德的也门朋友愤慨地对新华社记者说：“正当阿拉伯人民遭到美—以侵略的关键时刻，苏联不但不支持我们，反而从我们的背后给了我们一刀。苏联真是可恶。现在我们已经看清楚了苏联玩弄的全是两面派手段，对我们阿拉伯人民是假支持、真出卖。”
    另一位也门朋友说：“苏联和美国一样。现在我们不需要象苏联这样的‘朋友’。要苏联和美国一样滚出去！”
    一位居住在也门的阿拉伯朋友说：“苏联不是我们的朋友，而是我们的敌人的朋友。”
    他指出：“当美国和以色列向阿拉伯人民发动侵略时，苏联不支持我们，相反，却伙同美国向阿拉伯国家施加压力，搞‘停火’……”
    伊拉克《阿拉伯之声报》九日揭露苏修统治集团对阿拉伯人民背信弃义的罪行时指出：“人们认为是友好的这个国家曾经答应给阿拉伯人民以援助，但是，当它需要履行义务的时候，它却象敌人那样行事。”这家报纸愤怒地对苏修统治集团说：“我们将不再向你们要任何东西。反对以色列的战斗是一亿人的战斗……你们已经给了我们一个永远不会忘记的教训。”
    阿联《今日消息》周刊主编穆罕默德·塔比十日发表文章，谴责苏修拒绝向阿拉伯人民提供援助来反击美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家的军事侵略。文章说：“某一大国被认为是我们的朋友，并且本应该支持我们来抗击新的三国侵略的”。但是，“这个国家的领导人只满足于同
  （以色列）特拉维夫政府会谈……”
    苏丹《国民报》九日发表评论指出，苏修统治集团伙同美英帝国主义策划的“停火决议”，是为了把阿拉伯人民置于死地。它说：“我们将不放下武器，不管柯西金愿意不愿意。”
    《新苏丹报》在一篇文章中谴责苏修统治集团说：“你们的立场是可耻的……那些在危机的时候逃跑的人是我们的敌人……最坏的敌人。”
    几内亚“革命之声电台”和坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》七日和九日先后发表评论，强烈谴责苏修统治集团出卖阿拉伯人民的反帝事业，并且强调指出，阿拉伯人民的唯一出路，是把这场反侵略的正义战争进行到底！
