The editorial board notes: After the publication of the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the editorial by the Red Flag Magazine titled "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology," the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee immediately convened an expanded meeting for serious discussion and made a decision. The Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily published editorials on this matter. This revolutionary spirit of swift and decisive action is commendable.

The editorial of the Wenhui Daily points out: "After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, the struggle against the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the counter-restoration by the proletariat still exists. The main feature of this struggle is the bourgeoisie's corruption and infiltration of the proletarian revolutionary faction, especially the leadership core, attempting a 'peaceful evolution.' In this situation, all levels of revolutionary committees and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations face new and severe tests."

It must be understood that after the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, their position changes. Some comrades' bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies can easily grow and manifest, while the dust of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie from society comes at them head-on. We must be highly conscious and constantly use the weapons given to us by Chairman Mao to transform our thoughts and resolutely resist all ideological styles of the exploiting classes. At the dawn of national victory in 1949, Chairman Mao taught us to be highly vigilant against the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction must remember Chairman Mao's teachings. Striving for power and profit, extravagance and waste, corruption and decadence, and the attitude of a young master are all sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. Only by firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds can we not only win the battle under the suppression of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party but also win the battle against the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets.

As pointed out by the editorial of the Liberation Daily, those in power must stay close to the masses and "must mobilize the masses to supervise the members of various levels of revolutionary committees and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations." The revolutionary supervision from below by the hundreds of millions of people armed with great Mao Zedong Thought is the most reliable guarantee for preventing the emergence of revisionism. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought should be supported and implemented, and whatever is not should be opposed and resisted. This extremely important principle must be strictly followed after the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power and must not be violated. Those in power should criticize themselves for any speech or action that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, should genuinely correct it, and should allow and welcome others to criticize, resist, and oppose, and to supervise. Only in this way can errors be corrected in time, major errors and errors in direction and line be avoided, and degeneration and change of nature be prevented, truly holding power for the proletariat and using it well.

Resolutely Study and Implement the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee
—Decision of the Expanded Meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee on June 23, 1967

(1) The "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee on June 7, 1967, is an excellent document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and has extremely important universal significance. As pointed out by the editorial of the Red Flag Magazine: "These ten measures are very necessary. The regulations they make are not trivial matters of daily life but major political principles, relating to the establishment of a proletarian, revolutionary leadership cadre, relating to whether Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line can be executed, and whether proletarian character can be maintained." These regulations and the editorial of the Red Flag Magazine reflect our great leader Chairman Mao's consistent teachings to our party cadres. They are not only completely applicable to Shanghai but also urgently needed. All members of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee and leaders of various levels of revolutionary mass organizations must study them seriously with the spirit of rectification and implement them resolutely and without compromise.

(2) The key to seriously changing work styles is to stay close to the masses and blend with them, wholeheartedly serving as the masses' servants. All members of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a commoner," never separating from the masses, frequently participating in physical labor, and placing themselves under the supervision of the masses. All members of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee sincerely request all revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary masses to supervise and criticize all our words and deeds according to the requirements of Mao Zedong Thought; to constantly supervise and inspect our implementation of the regulations of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. It is wrong to vaguely consider criticism of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee or any of its members as "shelling the proletarian headquarters." Humble acceptance of criticism from the masses is an important guarantee for the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

(3) The fundamental issue in seriously changing work styles is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. All members of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to learn the "Three Articles" as a motto, constantly overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, and forever maintain revolutionary youth. During the period before and after the party's birthday on July 1, special attention should be paid to concentrating on studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Report on the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," and "The Working Methods of Party Committees," and comparing them with the regulations of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee to check our implementation, further carrying out rectification. Members of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee must conduct criticism and self-criticism seriously according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

The above decisions should be checked at regular intervals to ensure implementation.

### 坚决学习和贯彻《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》——上海市革命委员会一九六七年六月二十三日扩大会议决定

专栏：

    编者按：《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》发表之后，上海市革命委员会立即召开扩大会议，认真讨论，并作了决定；《文汇报》和《解放日报》为此发表了社论。这种雷厉风行的革命精神，值得提倡。
    《文汇报》社论指出：“无产阶级革命派掌了权以后，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争依然存在。这场斗争的主要特点就是资产阶级对无产阶级革命派，特别是对领导核心，进行腐蚀侵袭，搞‘和平演变’。”在这种形势下，各级革命委员会，各个革命群众组织的负责人，都面临着新的严峻考验。
    必须懂得，无产阶级革命派当权以后，地位发生了变化，有些同志头脑里的资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想很容易滋长和发作，而社会上的资产阶级、小资产阶级的灰尘也迎面扑来。我们必须高度自觉，不断地用毛主席交给我们的武器，改造自己的思想，坚决抵制一切剥削阶级的思想作风。在一九四九年，全国胜利的前夕，毛主席就教导我们，必须高度警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击。无产阶级革命派同志们要牢记毛主席的这个教导。争权夺利，铺张浪费，腐化堕落，大少爷作风，就是资产阶级的糖衣炮弹。我们只有在自己头脑中牢牢树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，才能不仅在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的镇压下打胜仗，而且能在资产阶级糖衣炮弹面前打胜仗。
    正如《解放日报》社论所指出的，当权的同志要密切联系群众，“必须发动群众对各级革命委员会成员和各级革命群众组织负责人进行监督。”用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万群众的自下而上的革命监督，这是我们防止出修正主义的最可靠的保证。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就拥护，就照办，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就反对，就抵制。这个极其重要的原则，在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，也必须坚决执行，而绝不能违反。当权的同志自己的一切不符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动，都应当作自我批评，应当切实改正，并且应当允许和欢迎别人批评、别人抵制、别人反对，允许和欢迎别人监督。只有这样，才能及时改正错误，不犯大错误，不犯方向路线错误，才能不蜕化变质，真正为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。
    坚决学习和贯彻《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》
    ——上海市革命委员会一九六七年六月二十三日扩大会议决定
    （一）山东省革命委员会一九六七年六月七日发出的《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、具有极其重要的普遍意义的好文件。正如《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》所指出的：“这十条措施是十分必要的。它们所作的规定，绝不是生活小节，而是重大的政治性的原则问题，是关系到建立一个无产阶级的、革命化的领导班子的问题，关系到能不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，能不能保持无产阶级本色的问题。”这些规定和《红旗》杂志评论员的文章，体现了我们伟大领袖毛主席对我们党的干部的一贯教导，对我们上海不仅完全适用，而且迫切需要。我们上海市革命委员会全体成员和各级革命群众组织负责人，必须以整风精神认认真真地学习，以雷厉风行态度不折不扣地执行。
    （二）认真转变作风的关键问题，是密切联系群众，和群众打成一片，全心全意地做人民群众的勤务员。上海市革命委员会全体成员和革命群众组织负责人必须坚决执行毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的指示，永远不脱离群众，经常参加体力劳动，把自己置于群众的监督之下。市革命委员会全体成员，诚恳地要求各革命群众组织和广大革命群众，对我们的一切言行，按照毛泽东思想的要求，实行严格的监督和批评；对我们学习贯彻山东省革命委员会规定的情况，进行经常的督促和检查。笼统地认为批评市革命委员会或她的某个成员就是“炮打无产阶级司令部”，这种不作阶级分析的说法，是错误的。虚心地听取来自群众的批评，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线能够得到正确贯彻的重要保证。
    （三）认真转变作风的根本问题，是活学活用毛主席著作，在自己头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。市革命委员会全体成员和革命群众组织的负责人，必须坚决响应林彪同志的号召：要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。不断破私立公，永葆革命青春。在党的诞生纪念日“七一”前后的一段时期，特别要集中学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和《党委会的工作方法》等光辉著作，并对照山东省革命委员会的规定，检查我们的执行情况，进一步开展整风。市革命委员会成员之间一定要按照毛主席的教导，认真地开展批评与自我批评。
    以上决定，每过一段时间检查一次，以保证贯彻执行。
