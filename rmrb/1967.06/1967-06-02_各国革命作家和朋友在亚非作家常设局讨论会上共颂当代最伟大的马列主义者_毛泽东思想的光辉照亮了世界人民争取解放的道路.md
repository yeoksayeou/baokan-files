Revolutionary writers and friends from various countries at the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau conference praised the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao. They emphasized that the luminous Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path for the world's peoples in their struggle for liberation.

They stressed that the current battle task for revolutionary writers is to awaken the world's peoples to struggle using Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries.

New China News Agency, June 1st: The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau held a conference to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The conference began today with discussions. Revolutionary writers and friends from various countries spoke passionately, praising the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, as the brightest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary peoples and writers. They enthusiastically hailed the luminous Mao Zedong Thought shining across the globe, illuminating the path for the world's peoples in their struggle for liberation.

Four revolutionary and progressive writers and friends—Malaya's Shalmar, Palestine's Samir Hakim, Yemen's Salah Dahhan, and North Kalimantan's Wen Mingquan—made lengthy speeches at today's conference. They emphasized that revolutionary writers must never forget class struggle and must use literature and art as important weapons to seize power, serving the revolutionary cause of the proletariat and the masses. Revolutionary writers must use their pens as guns, using Mao Zedong Thought to awaken the world's peoples to struggle, opposing imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries. This is the current noble battle task of revolutionary writers.

The revolutionary writers also enthusiastically hailed the brilliant victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and hailed the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in Beijing University, which Chairman Mao personally decided to circulate one year ago. They pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is not only a mass cultural revolution but also a great struggle by the proletariat to consolidate proletarian dictatorship. This struggle has made China a stronger bastion of world proletarian revolution and a more glorious vanguard for oppressed nations and peoples.

At the beginning of today's conference, revolutionary writers and friends from various countries, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," read passionately in unison: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general revolutionary front."

Malayan writer Shalmar pointed out in his speech that Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks," is a systematic and scientific historical summary of the struggle between the two lines on the literary and artistic front, a ideological weapon for the oppressed classes and peoples to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a declaration for preventing capitalist restoration and consolidating proletarian dictatorship under proletarian dictatorship.

Shalmar said that 25 years ago, Chairman Mao delivered the epoch-making "Talks," lighting a guiding lamp for all revolutionary literary and artistic workers from the caves of Yan'an. That is, "to make literature and art a good part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind."

He said, we must use "Talks" to build and strengthen the cultural army of the proletariat, use revolutionary violence to overthrow the exploiting classes, and after the exploiting classes are overthrown, immediately eliminate the remnants of old ideas, strike down the revisionist thoughts that may grow in the new society, and prevent capitalist restoration.

He stressed that every revolutionary literary and artistic worker must serve the masses, not the exploiters and oppressors. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must never forget class struggle and must never forget that class struggle is for the establishment and consolidation of proletarian dictatorship.

Shalmar happily recounted the great victories achieved by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line worldwide. He said that progressive and revolutionary writers, journalists, and other freedom fighters worldwide are using their pens and guns to fight against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries, achieving great victories.

He enthusiastically praised the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shattered the beautiful dreams of counter-revolutionary revisionists in China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. This made China a stronger bastion of world proletarian revolution and a more glorious vanguard for oppressed nations and peoples. He said that the most inspiring achievement of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the complete exposure and defeat of China's Khrushchev. He said that the Malayan people enthusiastically hailed these historic victories and regarded these victories as their own.

Shalmar introduced in his speech how revolutionary and progressive writers in Malaya combined Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts with Malayan revolutionary practices to engage in revolutionary struggles. He said that since Chairman Mao lit a guiding lamp for proletarian literature and art from the caves of Yan'an, Malayan revolutionary writers and progressive writers have been fighting continuously with progressive writers from Asia, Africa, and the world against British and American imperialism and their lackeys for the national liberation of Malaya.

He strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionists for engaging in dirty cultural infiltration and betraying Marxism-Leninism, splitting the revolutionary movement of Afro-Asian writers. He pointed out that Soviet modern revisionists have completely stood on the side of imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.

Shalmar finally stressed that revolutionary and progressive writers in Asia and Africa must firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, must use Mao Zedong Thought and the principles in "Talks," and enter the revolutionary struggle of our people, using pens as guns to serve the cause of proletarian revolution.

North Kalimantan writer Wen Mingquan said in his speech that the current era is the era of Mao Zedong, an era of new epoch opened by Mao Zedong Thought, an era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner! He enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts, which pointed out the direction for all revolutionary literary and artistic workers and all revolutionary practitioners worldwide. Wen Mingquan pointed out that Chairman Mao's "Talks," this brilliant work, is a programmatic document guiding revolutionary peoples and writers to grasp literature and art as a weapon to engage in class struggle, national liberation struggle, and struggle to seize power.

He said that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism led by the United States is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards comprehensive victory, a science of class struggle, a guarantee for the victory of world proletarian revolution, a guarantee for the proletarian state to never change color, and a powerful spiritual atomic bomb to defeat imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys. Wen Mingquan called on all revolutionaries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Wen Mingquan said, Chairman Mao said: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." In North Kalimantan, where the war of national liberation has not yet been won, the enemy always creates reactionary public opinion to numb the people's fighting will and extinguish the flames of national liberation struggle. Therefore, revolutionary literary and artistic workers must, under the leadership of the proletarian party, use all artistic forms that the masses like and easily accept to engage in a struggle of countering each other, making literature and art a powerful weapon to unite and educate the people, making literature and art a thought front army to seize power.

He said that in the current national liberation war in North Kalimantan, revolutionary literary and artistic workers in North Kalimantan must sing the praises of the hardworking and simple-minded thoughts of the laboring people of North Kalimantan, sing the praises of their fearless fighting spirit, and sing the praises of their great contributions and roles in the national liberation war.

Palestinian writer Samir Hakim said in his speech that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a powerful ideological weapon for the world's oppressed peoples to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. Palestinian writers regard the revolutionary literary line proposed by Chairman Mao in "Talks" as a lighthouse that forever shines, guiding all literary and artistic workers worldwide. It illuminates the path of struggle for revolutionary peoples.

He said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" creatively and brilliantly analyzed a series of major issues in Marxist literature, developed contemporary Marxist literary theory, and is the steering wheel for revolutionary peoples and writers in sharp and complex class struggles, helping us distinguish between true revolution and counter-revolution.

Samir said that Palestinian literary and artistic workers must study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly enter the fiery struggle, writing works that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the laboring masses, and fight against American imperialism.

Yemeni writer Salah Dahhan said in his speech that Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual food for the revolutionary peoples of all countries determined to defeat imperialism, capitalism, and reactionaries, and "Talks" is Chairman Mao's outstanding, great, creative, and complete contribution to the international communist movement and Marxist-Leninist literary theory.

Dahhan said that Chairman Mao pointed out in "Talks": "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. However, having only this army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." He said that the current situation in Arab countries confirms the truth that Chairman Mao said 25 years ago. If Arab writers had grasped Chairman Mao's literary thoughts in "Talks," we would now have a progressive cultural army that can blow the charge and rally Arab peoples to unite and fight the enemy with one heart and one mind.

Dahhan said that Yemeni revolutionary writers will definitely grasp Mao Zedong Thought, spiritually inspire the people to unite and fight the enemy, and oppose imperialism, capitalism, feudalism, and reactionaries.

Their speeches at the conference received enthusiastic applause from revolutionary writers and friends from various countries. When the conference adjourned, friends from various countries once again shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao's brilliant work, 'Talks'!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

    各国革命作家和朋友在亚非作家常设局讨论会上共颂当代最伟大的马列主义者
    毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了世界人民争取解放的道路
    他们强调指出：革命作家当前的战斗任务，是用毛泽东思想唤醒世界人民进行战斗，反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派
    新华社一日讯　由亚非作家常设局举行的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会”，今天开始大会讨论。各国革命作家和朋友在发言中热情地赞颂当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，是世界革命人民和革命作家心中最红最红的红太阳，热烈欢呼伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照全球，照亮了世界人民争取解放的道路。
    四位革命的、进步的作家和朋友，马来亚的沙尔玛、巴勒斯坦的赛米尔·哈克姆、也门的萨利赫·达汉、北加里曼丹的文铭权，在今天的讨论会上作了长篇发言。他们在发言中强调指出，革命的作家任何时候都不能忘记阶级斗争，不能忘记文学艺术必须作为夺取政权的重要武器，为无产阶级和人民大众的革命事业服务。革命的作家必须以笔为枪，用毛泽东思想唤醒世界人民进行战斗，反对以美国为首的帝国主义，反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，这是革命作家当前崇高的战斗任务。
    革命作家们在发言中还热烈欢呼一年来中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利，热烈欢呼当代最伟大的马列主义者毛主席亲自决定播发北京大学的全国第一张马列主义大字报发表一周年。他们指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅是一个群众性的文化革命运动，而且是无产阶级为巩固无产阶级专政而进行的一场伟大的斗争。这场斗争，使中国成为世界无产阶级革命更坚强的堡垒，成为被压迫民族和被压迫人民的更光荣的开路先锋。
    今天的讨论会开始时，各国革命作家和朋友们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，满怀激情地齐声朗读：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”
    马来亚作家沙尔玛在发言中指出，毛主席的光辉著作《讲话》，是一部文艺战线上两条路线斗争的系统的、科学的历史总结，是被压迫阶级和被压迫人民对帝、修、反进行斗争的思想武器，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，是在无产阶级专政下，防止资本主义复辟和巩固无产阶级专政的宣言书。
    沙尔玛说，二十五年前毛主席发表了具有划时代意义的《讲话》，从此，从延安的窑洞里向一切革命的文艺工作者点燃了指路明灯。那就是“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
    他说，我们要用《讲话》来建设和加强无产阶级文化大军，用革命的暴力来推翻剥削阶级，并在剥削阶级被推翻之后，紧接着去消灭旧思想的残余，打击在新社会中可能滋长起来的修正主义思想，防止资本主义复辟。
    他强调说，每个革命文艺工作者必须为人民大众服务，而不是为剥削者和压迫者服务。革命的文艺工作者任何时候都不能忘记阶级斗争，都不能忘记阶级斗争是为建立和巩固无产阶级专政服务的。
    沙尔玛在讲话中高兴地叙述了毛泽东主席的无产阶级革命路线在全世界所取得的伟大胜利。他说，全世界进步的和革命的作家、记者和其他的自由战士正在以笔杆子和枪杆子，同以美国为首的帝国主义，同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者及各国反动派，进行了一场又一场的斗争，并且取得了伟大胜利。
    他在讲话中热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命打破了中国、苏联和其他国家的反革命修正主义分子的美梦。这使中国成为世界无产阶级革命更坚强的堡垒，成为被压迫民族和被压迫人民的更光荣的开路先锋。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的所有成就中，最鼓舞人心的是中国的赫鲁晓夫被彻底揭露和完全击败。他说，马来亚人民热烈欢呼这些具有历史意义的胜利，并把这些胜利看作是自己的胜利。
    沙尔玛在发言中介绍了马来亚革命的和进步的作家把毛主席的文艺思想与马来亚的革命具体实践结合起来进行革命斗争的情况。他说，自从毛主席在延安为无产阶级文艺点燃指路明灯以来，马来亚的革命作家和进步作家就和亚非以及全世界进步作家一起，为反对英、美帝国主义及其走狗，为马来亚的民族解放，进行了不断的斗争。
    他在发言中强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者搞肮脏的文化渗透，谴责苏联现代修正主义者背叛马列主义，分裂亚非作家革命运动。他指出，苏联现代修正主义者已完全站到帝国主义和各国反动派一边。
    沙尔玛最后强调说，亚洲和非洲的革命的和进步的作家，必须坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，必须运用毛泽东思想和《讲话》中的原则，投入我们人民的革命斗争中，以笔为枪，为无产阶级革命事业服务。
    北加里曼丹作家文铭权在发言中，热情欢呼现在的时代是毛泽东的时代，是毛泽东思想开创新纪元的时代，是一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代！热烈欢呼毛主席的文艺思想为全世界一切革命的文艺工作者和一切革命的实践者指出了前进的道路和斗争的方向。文铭权指出，毛主席的《讲话》这部光辉著作，是指引革命人民和革命作家掌握文艺这个武器进行阶级斗争，进行民族解放斗争，进行夺取政权斗争的纲领性文件。
    他说，毛泽东思想是在以美帝为首的帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全面胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰的一门阶级斗争的科学，是保证全世界无产阶级革命胜利的最锐利武器，是保证无产阶级江山永不变色的最锐利的武器，是打败以美帝为首的帝国主义、以苏修为首的修正主义及其走狗的最强大的精神原子弹。文铭权号召亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切革命者认真地活学活用毛主席的一切著作。
    文铭权说，毛主席说过：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”在民族解放战争还没有取得胜利的北加里曼丹，敌人总是制造反动舆论，企图来麻痹人民的斗争意志，扑灭民族解放斗争的火焰。因此，革命的文艺工作者就有必要在无产阶级政党领导下，用群众喜闻乐见的，最容易接受的一切艺术形式，进行针锋相对的斗争，使文艺成为团结人民、教育人民的有力武器，使文艺成为夺取政权的一支思想战线的军队。
    他说，在当前北加里曼丹民族解放战争中，北加里曼丹革命的文艺工作者要歌颂北加里曼丹劳动人民勤劳朴素的思想作风，歌颂他们敢于斗争的大无畏精神，歌颂他们在民族解放战争中的伟大贡献和作用。
    巴勒斯坦作家赛米尔·哈克姆在发言中说，毛主席的《讲话》，是世界被压迫人民反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器。巴勒斯坦作家把毛主席在《讲话》中所提出的革命文艺路线，看作是为全世界所有的文学艺术家指引道路的永放光芒的灯塔，它照耀着革命人民斗争的道路。
    他说，毛主席的《讲话》创造性地、天才地分析了马克思主义文艺方面的一系列重大问题，发展了当代马克思主义文艺理论，它是革命人民和革命作家在尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中的方向盘，它帮助我们区别真革命和反革命。
    赛米尔说，巴勒斯坦文艺工作者应当更刻苦地学习毛泽东思想，应当按照毛主席的教导长期地、无条件地全心全意地投入火热的斗争中去，写出为工农兵和劳动人民大众服务，为揭露美帝国主义，反对美帝国主义而斗争的作品。
    也门作家萨利赫·达汉在发言中说，毛泽东思想是决心战胜帝国主义、资本主义、反动派的世界各国革命人民的精神食粮，《讲话》是毛主席对国际共产主义运动、对马列主义文艺理论的一个杰出的、伟大的、创造性的、完整的贡献。
    达汉说，毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”他说，阿拉伯国家当前的形势证实了毛主席二十五年前所说的真理。如果阿拉伯的作家们掌握了毛主席在《讲话》中的文艺思想，那么，我们现在就会有一支进步的文化军队，这支军队可以吹起进军号，促使阿拉伯人民团结一致，同心同德地和敌人作战。
    达汉说，也门革命作家们一定会掌握毛泽东思想，从精神上鼓舞人民同心同德地对敌斗争，反对帝国主义、资本主义、封建主义和反动派。
    他们在讨论会上的发言，博得了各国革命作家和朋友的热烈掌声。讨论会休会时，各国朋友再一次高呼：“毛主席的光辉著作《讲话》万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
