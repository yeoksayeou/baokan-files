In the midst of the triumphant march of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary forces on the publishing and printing front have brought a highly encouraging piece of news to the 700 million people of our country: In the first five months of this year, 29 million copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have been published nationwide. This figure exceeds the total number of copies published in the fifteen years before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by more than one and a half times; it is nearly 6 million copies more than the total number published in the whole of last year.

The unprecedented large-scale printing and publishing of Chairman Mao's works in our country is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It signifies that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high in the publishing and printing industry, and that the proletarian revolutionary forces have become the true masters of publishing and printing Chairman Mao's works.

The large-scale publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is the result of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao defeating the bourgeois reactionary line. The former Propaganda Department and Cultural Department, with a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, under the support of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought and were terrified of the revolutionary people mastering Mao Zedong Thought. They used their control over publishing power to block the publication of Chairman Mao's works in every possible way. On the contrary, this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists printed millions of copies of "Self-Cultivation" for their masters, peddling their black goods. According to statistics, the revolutionary treasure "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," which the broad revolutionary people love so much, was first published in 1951 and by June 1966, in fifteen years, only 11 million copies were published in total. However, the top capitalist-roader's poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," according to incomplete statistics from 1949 to 1953 and from 1962 to 1966, was published in twelve languages and various editions totaling 20.5 million copies and distributed to more than 80 countries and regions, spreading poison throughout the world. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary forces exposed the heinous crimes of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Propaganda Department and Cultural Department, who were supported by the top capitalist-roader in the Party. They were dragged out, overthrown, and their power was seized. From then on, the publishing power was truly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary forces. This is a brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and this victory provides favorable conditions for the large-scale printing of Chairman Mao's works and the more extensive spread of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary forces in the publishing industry, with boundless love and faith in the great leader Chairman Mao, proudly declare: "Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of the world's revolutionary people, they are spiritual atomic bombs. We must print Chairman Mao's books in large quantities, generation after generation! Let the boundless Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout China and the world!" In the first five months of this year, they concentrated their efforts on printing the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" while also publishing hundreds of millions of copies of Chairman Mao's individual works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." To meet the urgent needs of the broad revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's works, the publishing and distribution departments increased the number of distributors and distribution points, improved door-to-door services, and sent people to the countryside and factories to deliver books, ensuring that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can quickly obtain the works of the great leader Chairman Mao.

In just five months, printing such a large number of Chairman Mao's works was a great challenge. The proletarian revolutionary forces in the publishing industry, together with the broad revolutionary workers on the paper, ink, machinery, and transportation fronts, overcame various difficulties. The revolutionary workers on the paper front encountered a severe drought this year, a situation that had not been seen in many years, which brought great difficulties to production. However, the revolutionary forces were not deterred by the difficulties. In the cold winter, they broke through the ice layers of rivers, deepened the water channels, ensured water supply, and maintained normal production. Some small paper mills that had never produced paper for printing Chairman Mao's works successfully experimented with and produced high-quality paper using sugarcane pulp under poor technical conditions. The revolutionary workers on the machinery and ink production fronts also produced the various printing machines and inks needed for printing Chairman Mao's works with the fastest speed and the best quality. The transportation troops, to ensure the timely transportation of paper and meet the printing needs, would rather not eat or sleep, but they would never delay the transportation time for the paper used to print Chairman Mao's works. The broad revolutionary workers on the printing front also joined the battle with the spirit of "seizing the day." From large factories to small ones, they all participated in the printing of Chairman Mao's works. The workers supported and helped each other, their revolutionary enthusiasm grew stronger, and they extensively carried out technological innovations, reformed high-speed printing machines, and successfully experimented with wire-free binding methods under the conditions of no blueprints and poor equipment, ensuring the printing quality and greatly accelerating the printing of Chairman Mao's works.

Now, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country are rising up to criticize the top capitalist-roader in the Party. The broad revolutionary workers on the publishing and printing front, together with the people of the whole country, have joined this great struggle of criticism. They denounce with both pen and sword, severely exposing and accusing the top capitalist-roader in the Party of opposing Mao Zedong Thought and fiercely resisting the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. The proletarian revolutionary forces firmly declare: "We will never let the top capitalist-roader in the Party's plot succeed. We will definitely rise up with a thousand-pound hammer, thoroughly settle the accounts with the poison of 'Self-Cultivation,' print Chairman Mao's works in large quantities, propagate Mao Zedong Thought for life, let the boundless red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly throughout China and the world, let the iron-clad state of the proletariat remain unchanged for thousands of generations." The broad revolutionary workers, through the practical struggle of criticism, have received profound class education, further igniting their boundless love for the red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao, and further mobilizing their enthusiasm and creativity for production. They carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and do, and are printing more, faster, and better the treasured books of Chairman Mao that the world's revolutionary people yearn for day and night.

    让光焰无际的毛泽东思想红遍全中国红遍全世界
    《毛泽东选集》今年已出版两千九百多万部
    同时出版了毛主席著作单行本和《毛主席语录》数亿册今年头五个月出版的《选集》超过文化大革命前十五年出版数量总和的一倍半以上
    新华社十一日讯　在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，我国出版、印刷战线上的无产阶级革命派向全国七亿人民送来了一个十分振奋人心的好消息：今年头五个月，全国已出版《毛泽东选集》两千九百多万部。这个数字超过了无产阶级文化大革命前十五年出版数量总和的一倍半以上；比去年全年出版的数量还多近六百万部。
    我国出现这样空前未有的、大量地印刷出版毛主席著作的新局面，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。它标志着毛泽东思想伟大红旗已在我国出版印刷界的阵地上高高飘扬，无产阶级革命派已成为出版印制毛主席著作的真正的主人。
    《毛泽东选集》的大量出版，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的结果。旧中宣部、旧文化部内一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，对革命人民掌握毛泽东思想怕得要死。他们利用他们所把持的出版大权，千方百计地抵制出版毛主席著作。相反地，这一小撮反革命修正主义分子，却为他们的主子大印《修养》，兜售他们的黑货。据统计，广大革命人民无限热爱的革命宝书《毛泽东选集》，从一九五一年开始出版，到一九六六年六月，在十五年的时间内，总共才出版了一千一百多万部。而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》，根据从一九四九年到一九五三年、一九六二年到一九六六年短短几年的不完全统计，就用十二种文字和各种版本出版了两千零五十多万册，发行到八十多个国家和地区，流毒全世界。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派奋起揭露了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持的旧中宣部、旧文化部内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的滔天罪行，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子揪了出来，造了他们的反，夺了他们的权。从此，出版大权真正掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里。这是无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，这个胜利为大量印制毛主席著作，更加广泛地传播光焰无际的毛泽东思想提供了有利的条件。
    出版界的无产阶级革命派怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰的心情豪迈地说：“毛主席的宝书是世界革命人民的命根子，是精神原子弹。我们就是要大印特印毛主席的书，世世代代印！让光焰无际的毛泽东思想红遍全中国，红遍全世界！”今年头五个月中，他们在集中力量大印《毛泽东选集》的同时，还出版了数亿册毛主席著作单行本和《毛主席语录》。为了满足广大革命群众学习毛主席著作的迫切要求，出版发行部门增加了发行人员和发行网点，改进了门市供应工作，并派人下乡下厂，送书上门，使广大的工农兵尽快地得到伟大领袖毛主席的著作。
    在短短五个月中印制出这样多的毛主席著作，困难是很大的。出版界无产阶级革命派同造纸、油墨、机械、运输等各条战线上的广大革命职工共同协作，战胜了各种困难。造纸战线上的革命职工，今年遇到了多年来从未有过的供水严重不足的天旱季节，给生产带来了很大困难。但是革命派没有被困难吓倒，他们在天寒地冻的季节里，刨开河流的冰层，加深引水沟，保证了供水，坚持了正常生产。有些从未生产过印制毛主席著作用纸的小型纸厂，在设备技术条件差的情况下，经过反复试验，用甘蔗渣试制成功了印制毛主席著作用的好纸。机械系统和油墨生产战线上的革命职工，也以最快的速度，最好的质量，生产出印制毛主席著作所需要的各种印刷机械和油墨。运输战线的交通兵们，为了及时运输纸张，保证印刷的需要，宁可不吃饭，不睡觉，也决不耽误印制毛主席著作用纸的运输时间。印刷战线上的广大革命职工，更是以“只争朝夕”的精神投入战斗。从大厂到小厂都投入了毛主席著作的印制工作。职工们互相支援，互相帮助，革命干劲越来越足，并且广泛开展技术革新，改革高速印刷机，并在无图纸、设备差的条件下，试制成功了无线装订法，保证了印制质量，大大加速了毛主席著作的印制。
    现在，全国亿万革命群众正在奋起批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。出版、印刷战线上的广大革命职工，同全国人民一起投入了这场大批判战斗。他们口诛笔伐，狠狠地揭露和控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反对毛泽东思想、极力抵制出版和发行毛主席著作的滔天罪行。无产阶级革命派坚定地表示：“决不能让党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋得逞，我们一定要奋起千钧棒，彻底清算《修养》的流毒，大印特印毛主席著作，一辈子宣传毛泽东思想，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想红旗插遍全中国，插遍全世界，让无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。”广大革命职工在大批判的斗争实践中，受到了深刻的阶级教育，更加激发出对心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的无限热爱，进一步调动了生产积极性和创造性。他们发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，正在更多、更快、更好地印制世界革命人民日夜盼望的毛主席的宝书。
