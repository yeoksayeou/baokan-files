The "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Propaganda of Chairman Mao's 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'" points out: "This era-making work creatively develops the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and the theory of class struggle and dictatorship of the proletariat. It first expounds on the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, laying the theoretical foundation for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a great contribution to the international communist cause. It is an extremely important guide for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country."

They must focus on studying: the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, preventing capitalist restoration, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat; correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions of different natures. Through study, deeply understand the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, recognize the problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, to further raise the class consciousness of officers and soldiers, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and better complete the various tasks undertaken by our army.

    Officers and soldiers participating in the "three supports, two military" work must, through the study of this document, seriously summarize experiences, correctly distinguish and handle two types of contradictions of different natures, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, oppose the bourgeois reactionary line, more firmly support the revolutionary leftists, promote the great alliance of revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and better complete the "three supports, two military" tasks.

    Military organs, academies, and cultural and sports units currently carrying out the "four greats" should use this document as a weapon to rectify the work, summarize the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, carry forward achievements, correct shortcomings, reform worldviews, raise revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and according to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," correctly handle contradictions among revolutionary organizations, oppose "fighting internal wars," correctly treat cadres, correctly treat the masses who were deceived into joining conservative organizations, oppose anarchism, individualism, subjectivism, factionalism, cliquism, and bourgeois style, achieve the great alliance of revolution, and better complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

    新华社十八日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部于六月十八日发出通知，号召全军干部、战士认真学习毛主席的伟大著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。通知中说：
    今年六月十九日，是毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一划时代的伟大著作发表十周年。《中共中央关于宣传毛主席〈关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题〉的通知》指出：“这部划时代的著作，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的唯物辩证法和阶级斗争、无产阶级专政的学说。它第一次阐明了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，为在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命奠定了理论基础。它是对于国际共产主义事业的伟大贡献。它是当前我国进行的无产阶级文化大革命的极为重要的指南。”
    中央决定重新发表这一伟大著作，并大张旗鼓地深入细致地展开宣传活动。这将对当前无产阶级文化大革命运动发生极其伟大的指导作用。各部队应坚决贯彻执行中央的通知。要组织干部战士认真学习这一伟大著作，把两条路线斗争的教育深入一步。要着重学习：社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政；正确区别和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。要通过学习，深刻领会无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，认识在无产阶级专政条件下的革命问题，和如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，以进一步提高干部战士的阶级觉悟，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，更好地完成我军所担负的各项任务。
    参加“三支”、“两军”工作的干部战士，要通过这一文件的学习，认真总结经验，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，牢牢把握斗争的大方向，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对资产阶级反动路线，更坚定地支持革命左派，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，更好地完成“三支”、“两军”的任务。
    正在开展“四大”的军队机关、院校和文艺体育单位的革命群众，要以这一文件为武器，进行整风，总结一年来无产阶级文化大革命的经验，发扬成绩，纠正缺点，改造世界观，提高革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，按照“团结——批评——团结”的方针，正确处理各革命组织之间的矛盾，反对“打内战”，正确对待干部，正确对待受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众，反对无政府主义、个人主义、主观主义、小团体主义、山头主义和资产阶级作风，实现革命的大联合，更好地完成本单位的斗、批、改。
