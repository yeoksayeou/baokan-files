We workers at Tianjin's Third Woolen Mill (formerly Dongya Woolen Mill) were infuriated after watching the poisonous film "City That Never Sleeps"!

This film does not praise the proletariat and working people; instead, it stands on the reactionary bourgeoisie's side, viciously defaming the working class and trying to whitewash the sinister capitalists.

From the very beginning, the film portrays Zhang Bokhan as a great "patriot." When foreign monopoly capital began to flood into China, he created a "patriotic" trademark to show that he is a "patriot." After this makeover by the film, the reactionary capitalist Zhang Bokhan becomes a "red capitalist"!

This is a blatant fabrication!

Capitalists always put on a show, claiming to be patriots. In reality, if you look at their bloody histories of getting rich, you can find countless connections with foreign monopoly capitalism and their treacherous acts of selling out the country. Take the capitalists of our mill (formerly Dongya Woolen Mill), Song Qiqing, for example. When the Japanese invaders were ravaging China, the Chinese people despised imperialism and boycotted foreign goods everywhere. At that time, the fraudulent Song Qiqing exploited the Chinese people's patriotic sentiments and created a trademark that claimed to be anti-imperialist, "Yi Yang Brand." The trademark had sixteen large characters: "The only domestic product, completely domestic, specially approved by the National Government, exempt from all taxes and duties." This way, the product sold nationwide, and Song Qiqing made a fortune. Later, to intensify exploitation, Song Qiqing played many new tricks with the "Yang" (foreign) character: things like "Riding the Sheep," "Double Sheep," "Herald of the Sheep," and "Su Wu Herding Sheep," showing his contempt for foreigners and his true patriotism. But behind this respectable patriotic trademark, there were dirty deals with foreign monopoly capitalism. The raw materials Song Qiqing used were all imported from Britain and Japan. His factory was a genuine colonial processing plant, completely serving imperialist colonial policies, not "Yi Yang (resist foreign)" at all!

Look at the Song family's background, and the problem becomes even clearer. Song Qiqing's grandfather was involved with the bloodless foreign missionaries, committing countless crimes against the country and the people. Song Qiqing's father recognized the enemy as his father, worshipping a British missionary as his godfather. The Song family relied on foreign power to oppress and exploit the working people. They were loyal servants of imperialism, with not a trace of being Chinese.

Ironclad facts prove that these capitalists, under the guise of "patriotism," colluded with imperialism, stripping the people of their wealth. Their "patriotism" was not for the proletariat and working people's country but for the kingdom of the exploiting class. Their so-called "patriotism" was actually a convenient way to exploit the people and make money. However, the authors of the film "City That Never Sleeps" turned black into white, trying to glorify the capitalists.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party once shamelessly praised the reactionary capitalist Song Qiqing, and the author of "City That Never Sleeps" fabricated a "patriotic" "red capitalist" Zhang Bokhan, serving the reactionary political line of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party.

We, the working class, are the sworn enemies of the reactionary capitalists. We see through their true faces the clearest and know them the best. The biggest capitalist-roader in the party and his yes-men defame the working class, dressing up the reactionary bourgeoisie as "red capitalists," aiming to restore capitalism. However, history is merciless; their beautification of the bourgeoisie cannot save the bourgeoisie from its doom. On the contrary, their fate will be the same as that of the reactionary bourgeoisie, swept into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people.

    不许往资本家脸上贴金

    看了毒草影片《不夜城》，把我们工人的肺都气炸了！
    这部影片不是歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民，而是站在反动的资产阶级立场上，恶毒地丑化工人阶级，极力为罪恶累累的资本家涂脂抹粉。
    影片一开始，就写张伯韩大搞“爱国”事业。当外国垄断资本大量侵入中国的时候，他搞什么“爱国牌”商标，表示自己是“爱国”的。经过影片这一番乔装打扮，反动的资本家张伯韩就成了一个爱国的“红色资本家”了。
    这完全是别有用心的捏造！
    资本家总是装模作样，标榜自己爱国。其实，只要翻开他们血淋淋的发家史，处处都可以找到他们与外国垄断资本主义的千丝万缕的联系，找到他们卖国致富的罪恶事实。拿我们厂（前东亚毛纺厂）的资本家宋棐卿来说，日本鬼子侵略中国的时候，因为中国人民恨透了帝国主义，所以处处抵制洋货。当时，惯于招摇撞骗的宋棐卿就利用中国人民的爱国心理，搞了个标榜反帝的商标“羝羊牌”。商标上写着十六个大字：“唯一国产、完全国货、国府特许、概免税厘”。这样一来，商品畅销全国，宋棐卿大发了横财。后来，宋棐卿为了加紧剥削，就在这个“羊”（洋）字上大作文章，耍了许多新花招：什么“骑羊”啦，“双羊”啦，“群羊”啦，“苏武牧羊”啦，表明自己蔑视洋人，真正爱国的。但是在这冠冕堂皇的爱国商标背后，隐藏着与外国垄断资本主义的肮脏交易。宋棐卿所用的原料都是从英国、日本进口的，他办的工厂是个不折不扣的殖民地性质的加工厂，完全是为帝国主义的殖民主义政策效劳的，根本不是什么“羝羊（抵洋）”！
    再看宋家的家底，问题就更清楚了。宋棐卿的爷爷跟杀人不见血的外国传教士勾勾搭搭，干尽了祸国殃民的罪恶勾当。宋棐卿的爹认贼作父，拜英国传教士做干爹。宋家就是倚仗洋人势力来压榨和剥削劳动人民的。他们是帝国主义的忠实奴才，没有一丝一毫中国人的味道。
    铁的事实证明，这些资本家在所谓“爱国”的招牌下，勾结帝国主义，刮尽了民脂民膏。他们的“爱国”，爱的不是无产阶级和劳动人民之国，而是剥削阶级的王国。他们标榜的“爱国主义”，实际上是更便于剥削人民的发财之道。但是，影片《不夜城》的作者却颠倒黑白，极力往资本家脸上贴金。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派曾经无耻地吹捧过反动资本家宋棐卿，而《不夜城》的作者就捏造了一个“爱国”的“红色资本家”张伯韩，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动政治路线服务。
    我们工人阶级是反动资本家的死对头。我们对资本家的面目看得最明，认得最清。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的应声虫们丑化工人阶级，把反动的资产阶级打扮成“红色资本家”，就是想复辟资本主义。但是历史是无情的，他们美化资产阶级，绝不能挽救资产阶级灭亡的命运。相反，他们的下场也只能和反动的资产阶级一样，被我们革命人民扫进历史的垃圾堆。
