Mountains are boiling, seas are roaring. Amidst the triumphant songs of the decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the moment when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are uniting to launch a decisive attack against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our country's first hydrogen bomb has successfully exploded!

Let us shout and sing with all our hearts!

When the radio broadcast this heart-stirring news, the campus of Beijing Aeronautical Institute was illuminated with red lanterns, drums were beating, and the entire campus was filled with songs and dances. The Red Flag warriors and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff enthusiastically celebrated another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the further strengthening and consolidation of our country's national defense forces, and the complete collapse of the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and modern revisionism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as June 1958: "To develop a few atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is completely possible in ten years."

With high morale and fighting spirit, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and with boundless energy, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, promoting revolution and production, we have overcome one difficulty after another and finally blazed a trail of our own.

"Ten thousand years is too long, we must strive for every moment."

In just two years and eight months, we have developed the atomic bomb, missiles, and now the hydrogen bomb. Chairman Mao's wise prediction has come true!

The successful explosion of our country's hydrogen bomb is a heavy blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, a great encouragement and support to the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting the anti-American national salvation war, to the Arab people who are resisting the aggression of American and British imperialism and their lackey Israel, to the revolutionary people of the world, and to our Hong Kong compatriots who are fighting against British oppression and violence.

We, all the Red Flag warriors and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Aeronautical Institute, firmly support the repeated declarations of our government's principled stand. China's necessary and limited nuclear tests and the development of nuclear weapons are purely for defense, and the ultimate goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons.

Riding the east wind and breaking through ten thousand waves, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, let us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, unite closely and launch a fierce attack against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and strive to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation!

    美帝苏修的核垄断彻底破产了
    北京航空学院革命委员会
    北京航空学院红旗战斗队
    山在沸腾，海在呼啸。在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击的决战时刻，我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！
    让我们尽情地欢呼，尽情地歌唱吧！
    当广播中传出这一振奋人心的喜讯时，北京航空学院的校园里红灯高照，锣鼓喧天，满园歌声满园舞。红旗战士和革命师生员工们热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的又一辉煌成果，欢呼我国国防力量更加坚强巩固，欢呼帝国主义、现代修正主义的核垄断走向彻底的破产。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早在一九五八年六月就指出：搞一点原子弹、氢弹，我看有十年功夫完全可能。
    我国人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，满怀革命的豪情，拿出冲天的干劲，在党中央、毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，抓革命，促生产，越过了一条条鸿沟，克服了一个个困难，终于闯出一条自己的道路。
    “一万年太久，只争朝夕。”
    在短短的两年零八个月的时间内，我们有了原子弹，有了导弹，现在又有了氢弹。毛主席的英明预言实现了！
    我国氢弹爆炸成功，是对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的当头一棒，是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的沉重打击，对正在英勇地进行抗美救国战争的越南人民，对正在反抗美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略的阿拉伯人民，对全世界革命人民，对正在进行反英抗暴斗争的我香港爱国同胞，都是极大的鼓舞和支持。
    我们北京航空学院全体红旗战士和全院革命师生员工坚决拥护我国政府的一再声明的严正立场。中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，完全是为了防御，其最终目的就是为了消灭核武器。
    乘东风，破万里浪。在毛主席革命路线的指引下，让我们无产阶级革命派紧密地团结在一起，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，为完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务而奋斗！
