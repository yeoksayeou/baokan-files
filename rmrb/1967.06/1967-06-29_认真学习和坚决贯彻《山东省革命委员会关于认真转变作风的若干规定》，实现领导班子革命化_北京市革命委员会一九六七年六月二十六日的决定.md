The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee's Decision of June 26, 1967

	(1) The "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee on June 7, 1967, and the editorial by the "Red Flag" magazine titled "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology" are extremely important documents that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The ten measures proposed by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are not trivial matters of personal conduct but are major political principles. They are related to whether we can implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and maintain our proletarian character. They are also related to whether we can prevent "peaceful evolution" and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. These ten measures are not only fully applicable to Beijing but are also urgently needed. All members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee must resolutely and unconditionally implement and execute them.

	(2) All members of the Revolutionary Committee must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses" and "ensuring that comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried style, and ensuring that comrades continue to maintain a style of hard struggle." They must frequently go deep among the masses, care about the masses' concerns, understand the masses' needs, listen to the masses' voices, and accept the masses' criticisms and supervision.

	(3) The Revolutionary Committee must implement the principle of democratic centralism. All members of the Revolutionary Committee must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, take the lead in implementing the policies, laws, notices, and decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and not allow any violation of discipline. The Revolutionary Committee must regularly check the implementation of the central government's various policies across the city.

	(4) Study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind. This is the fundamental key to seriously changing work styles and is also the fundamental guarantee to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and prevent capitalist restoration. We must establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao in all aspects and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. All our words and actions must be measured by whether they conform to Mao Zedong Thought. All members of the Revolutionary Committee must take the lead in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, achieving daily study and daily application. We must study the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and carry out ideological revolutionization. Members of the Revolutionary Committee must put politics in command, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and carry out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. At present, all members of the Revolutionary Committee must, based on the study of Chairman Mao's works, compare with the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, further carry out rectification, conduct criticism and self-criticism among themselves, and especially welcome criticisms from revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations across the city regarding the members of the Revolutionary Committee.

	(5) This decision also applies to all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations across the city. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations across the city must mobilize the masses to study and discuss the "Regulations" of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and based on the situation of their own units, propose specific measures to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and seriously change work styles, and resolutely implement them.

    认真学习和坚决贯彻《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，实现领导班子革命化
    北京市革命委员会一九六七年六月二十六日的决定
      （一）山东省革命委员会一九六七年六月七日发出的《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的极其重要的文件。山东省革命委员会提出的十条措施，绝不是生活小节，而是重大的政治性的原则问题，是关系到能不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，能不能保持无产阶级本色的问题，也是关系到能不能防止“和平演变”，巩固无产阶级专政的问题。这十条措施对于我们北京不仅完全适用，而且迫切需要。北京市革命委员会全体成员必须坚决地不折不扣地贯彻执行。
      （二）革命委员会的全体成员必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”和“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大指示，经常深入群众，关心群众的痛痒，体察群众的需要，倾听群众的呼声，接受群众的批评和监督。
      （三）革命委员会实行民主集中制的原则。革命委员会的全体成员要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，带头贯彻执行中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组以及北京市革命委员会的各项政策、法令、通知和决定，不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。革命委员会要经常检查全市贯彻执行中央各项政策的情况。
      （四）活学活用毛主席著作，在自己的头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这是认真转变作风的根本关键，也是抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀，防止资本主义复辟的根本保证。我们必须在各个方面树立毛主席的绝对权威，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们的一切言论行动都必须以是否符合毛泽东思想为最高准则。革命委员会的全体成员必须带头活学活用毛主席著作，做到天天学，天天用。要把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞好思想革命化。革命委员会的成员要政治挂帅，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，进行深入细致的思想政治工作。在当前，革命委员会的全体成员要在学习毛主席著作的基础上，对照《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，进一步开展整风，互相之间开展批评和自我批评，特别欢迎全市革命群众和革命群众组织对革命委员会的成员提出批评意见。
      （五）本决定也适用于全市各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织。全市各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织都要发动群众学习和讨论山东省革命委员会的《规定》，并结合本单位的情况，提出关于防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，认真转变作风的具体措施，并且坚决执行。
