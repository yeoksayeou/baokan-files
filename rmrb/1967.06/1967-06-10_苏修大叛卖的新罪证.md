In this round of the Arab people's struggle against the aggression of the U.S. and Israel, the Soviet revisionist leadership conspired with U.S. and British imperialism, acting as the executioners to suppress the Arab national liberation movement. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like shamelessly betrayed the interests of the Arab people, yet still pretended to be on the side of the Arab people. They are truly shameless.

The evidence is clear; the Soviet revisionist traitors want to hide their blood-stained hands behind their backs and slip away. This is absolutely impossible.

Why, when Israel was threatening war against the Arab countries, did the Soviet revisionist clique insist on telling the Arab people to "restrain themselves," thereby lulling them into complacency?

Why did the Soviet revisionists swear to support the Arab people, but when Israel launched a surprise attack on the Arab countries, they stood by and did nothing as the Arab countries were invaded?

Why, when it was clearly the U.S. imperialists directing Israel to carry out armed aggression and later directly participating in the aggression, did the Soviet revisionist clique not dare to touch the United States even a little?

Why did the Soviet revisionist clique, after expressing opposition to "an immediate ceasefire by all parties" in the Security Council, immediately vote in favor of the "immediate ceasefire" resolution together with the United States, and then hastily put forward a proposal for a "limited ceasefire"?

Why did the Soviet revisionist clique hypocritically denounce Israel, but after Israel controlled the Gulf of Aqaba, Soviet ships were the first to pass through the Strait of Tiran and were saluted by the Israeli invading army?

And so on. Now all these questions have clear answers.

The White House spokesman on the 8th openly announced that Johnson and Kosygin had recently used the "hotline" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union multiple times to discuss the Middle East situation. The "hotline" established by Kennedy and Khrushchev for counter-revolutionary collusion, which they did not have the chance to use, was this time put to use by their successors to conspire counter-revolutionary activities. This completely confirms that the plot of Israel's aggression against the Arab countries was orchestrated by the counter-revolutionary black line connecting Washington and Moscow.

The Soviet revisionist clique has been involved from the beginning in the U.S. imperialists' sinister plan to invade the Arab countries. They colluded with U.S. imperialism to force the Arab people to submit. All those high-sounding declarations and serious speeches were nothing but tricks. They used these tricks to deceive the Arab people together with U.S. imperialism, aiming to jointly dominate the Arab world.

People can clearly see that the Soviet revisionist clique has completely degenerated into a bunch of bourgeois politicians. To please U.S. imperialism, they betrayed the Arab people and shamelessly used the political tricks of imperialism. They specialized in backroom deals, playing both sides, sweet-talking while stabbing in the back, and being two-faced. They are utterly despicable.

The Soviet revisionists' great betrayal has caused great harm to the Arab people's just cause of resisting aggression, but at the same time, it has given the Arab people a good lesson. Although the Arab people have paid a price, they have learned a great deal from the Soviet revisionist clique, this negative teacher. They not only can see the true face of the Soviet revisionist clique, this false friend, but will also understand that to oppose imperialism, they must oppose the Soviet revisionist clique, these accomplices of imperialism.

    苏修大叛卖的新罪证
    在这一次阿拉伯人民反抗美以侵略者的斗争中，苏修领导集团同美英帝国主义合谋，充当了镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动的刽子手。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流无耻地出卖阿拉伯人民的利益，居然还在装模作样，要人相信他们是站在阿拉伯人民一边的。真是死不要脸。
    罪证俱在，苏修叛徒们想把沾满血迹的双手藏在背后，蒙混过关，这是绝对办不到的。
    为什么在以色列剑拔弩张地对阿拉伯国家进行战争威胁的时候，苏修集团却一股劲地要阿拉伯人民“克制”，麻痹他们的警惕性呢？
    为什么苏修指天发誓说是要支持阿拉伯人民，而当以色列对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击以后，他们却眼看着阿拉伯国家遭受侵略而袖手旁观呢？
    为什么明明是美帝国主义指挥以色列进行武装侵略，而且后来直接参加了侵略行动，苏修集团却一丝一毫也不敢碰美国呢？
    为什么苏修集团在安理会刚刚表示反对“各方立即停火”，语音未落就同美国一起举手赞成“立即停火”的决议，而且自己又迫不及待地提出主张“限期停火”的提案呢？
    为什么苏修集团装腔作势地指责以色列，而在以色列控制亚喀巴湾以后，苏修的船只最先通过蒂朗海峡并且受到以色列侵略军敬礼呢？
    如此等等，现在都可以得到清楚的答案了。
    白宫发言人八日就毫不隐讳地宣布，约翰逊和柯西金最近多次使用美苏之间的“热线”，就中东局势通话。肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫为了进行反革命勾结建立起来而没来得及使用的“热线”，这一回却由他们的两个继承人启用来密谋反革命的勾当。这就完全证实了以色列侵略阿拉伯国家这一个大阴谋，是由华盛顿和莫斯科之间的这条名为“热线”的反革命黑线贯穿起来的。
    苏修集团自始至终参与了美帝国主义策划的侵略阿拉伯国家罪恶计划。他们同美帝国主义串通一气来迫使阿拉伯人民就范。所有那些冠冕堂皇的声明、一本正经的发言，都统统不过是骗人的把戏。他们就是用这一套来伙同美帝国主义愚弄阿拉伯人民，以达到共同主宰阿拉伯世界的目的。
    人们可以清楚地看到，苏修集团已完全堕落成为一伙资产阶级政客。他们为了迎合美帝国主义，出卖阿拉伯人民，竟然大肆玩弄帝国主义所惯用的政治手腕，专门在幕后搞肮脏的交易，阴一套，阳一套，口蜜腹剑，两面三刀。简直是卑鄙到了极点。
    苏修的大叛卖，给阿拉伯人民反侵略的正义事业造成了很大的损害，但是同时也给阿拉伯人民上了很好的一课。阿拉伯人民虽然付出了代价，却从苏修集团这个反面教员得到了很大的教益。他们不仅可以看清苏修集团这个假朋友的真面目，而且将会懂得，要反对帝国主义，就必须反对苏修集团这伙帝国主义的帮凶。
