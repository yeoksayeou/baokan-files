The article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" published by Chairman Mao ten years ago is a brilliant document marking an epoch in the development of Marxism. In this brilliant document, Chairman Mao brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and the theory of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. This document is a great program for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and an important milestone in the development of Marxism to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

This brilliant document comprehensively summarizes the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat at home and abroad. It uses the proletarian dialectical materialist worldview to observe and solve various problems in socialist society. For the first time in the history of Marxism, it scientifically, systematically, and profoundly analyzes the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, elucidates the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and proposes the theory, policies, and guidelines for distinguishing between contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people and correctly handling these two types of contradictions.

Currently, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing triumphantly against the wind and waves. Now, studying Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," in conjunction with studying the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" personally drafted by Chairman Mao and the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" dated May 16, 1966, and studying Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and guidelines on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is of extreme importance for achieving the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, achieving the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, carrying out a thorough criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In a socialist society, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, whether or not to acknowledge the continued existence of classes and class struggle, whether or not to acknowledge that class struggle is ultimately a struggle for state power, whether or not to acknowledge that it is a struggle between the proletariat to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, is the key to determining the fate of socialism.

The greatest betrayal of Marxism-Leninism by the Khrushchev revisionist clique is the creation of the "theory" of the "whole people's state" and the "whole people's party." According to this "theory," contradictions disappear in a socialist society, classes vanish, class struggle vanishes, and they talk about achieving "communism with potato stew and beef." As the representatives of the new and old bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union, they use this "theory" to deceive the people, attack the proletariat, turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, turn the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a bourgeois party, and carry out the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road in China sings the same tune as the Khrushchevs in the Soviet Union. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production in our country, this biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road completely opposes Comrade Mao Zedong, advocating the theory of the extinction of class struggle, saying that "the domestic enemies have basically been eliminated," "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended, or has basically been resolved, that is, the contradictions between the enemy and us have basically been resolved." "There will be no more revolutionary struggles, no more socialist transformations." "The question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism has now been resolved," "the most important task of the state is to organize social life." All his political activities are permeated with this black line. His goal, like that of the Khrushchevs in the Soviet Union, is to attempt to turn our proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship, turn the Communist Party of China into a bourgeois party, and carry out the restoration of capitalism in China.

Chairman Mao's theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, and his theory on revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, are precisely developed in the struggle against international and domestic revisionism.

In our country, immediately after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, Chairman Mao pointed out in his great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere, is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." "The question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism in the ideological sphere in our country will take a considerable amount of time to resolve."

Chairman Mao also pointed out: "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there is still a part of society that dreams of restoring the capitalist system. They will struggle against the working class from all sides, including the ideological struggle."

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the representatives of those who dream of restoring the capitalist system. During the three years of natural disasters in our country, they collaborated with the anti-China chorus of U.S. imperialism and the Khrushchev revisionists, instigating a comprehensive counterrevolutionary restoration movement from top to bottom. Various anti-Party and anti-socialist works such as "three freedoms and one contract," "three harmonies and one reduction," the theory of "merging two into one," and "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," emerged one after another, and the ghosts and monsters came out in droves, stirring up a wind of individual farming, rehabilitation, capitulation, and freedom.

At the Central Work Conference in Beidaihe in August 1962 and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in September, Chairman Mao made two speeches of great historical significance, which were the products of the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These speeches corrected the right-opportunist line and stopped the black wind of capitalist counterrevolutionary restoration. In these two speeches, Chairman Mao continued to expound the Marxist-Leninist points in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," clearly pointing out: "Socialist society is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exists the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration. We must recognize the long-term and complex nature of this struggle. We must be vigilant. We must carry out socialist education. We must correctly understand and handle the problems of class contradictions and class struggle, correctly distinguish and handle the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people. Otherwise, our socialist state will go to the opposite side, will change its nature, and will result in a restoration. From now on, we must talk about this issue year after year, month after month, day after day, so that we have a relatively clear understanding of this issue and have a Marxist-Leninist line."

In May 1963, Chairman Mao personally presided over the drafting of the "Draft Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Current Problems in Rural Work," also known as the "First Ten Points," issuing a great call to launch the socialist education movement. In this extremely important document, Chairman Mao put forward to the whole Party and the people of the whole country that if we forget about classes and class struggle in a socialist society, "then in a short time, a few years or a dozen years, or in a longer time, a few decades, it will be inevitable to have a nationwide counterrevolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color. Think about it, comrades, what a dangerous situation this is!"

On June 14, 1963, the brilliant Marxist-Leninist document "Suggestions on the General Line of the International Communist Movement," also known as the "Twenty-Five Points," was published. This is the great program of the international communist movement in contemporary times, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. In this document, which Chairman Mao personally presided over the drafting of, it is pointed out:

"In a very long historical period after the proletariat seizes power, the continuation of class struggle is an objective law that does not change with people's will, only the form of class struggle is different from before the proletariat seizes power.

After the October Revolution, Lenin repeatedly pointed out:

1. The overthrown exploiters will always try every means to restore their 'paradise.'
2. The spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie constantly produce new capitalist elements.
3. In the ranks of the working class, in the personnel of state organs, due to the influence of the bourgeoisie and the encirclement and corruption of the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie, there will also be some degenerate elements, new bourgeois elements.
4. The encirclement of international capitalism, the threat of imperialist armed intervention, and the conspiracy of peaceful disintegration are the external conditions for the continuation of class struggle in socialist countries.

Actual life has confirmed Lenin's above points.

In any socialist country, even after decades, or even longer, of achieving socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, it cannot be said that there are no elements like the bourgeois parasites, leeches, speculators, swindlers, idlers, hooligans, and thieves of the state treasury that Lenin repeatedly denounced; nor can it be said that socialist countries no longer need or can abandon the task of 'cleansing these infectious diseases, epidemics, and ulcers left by capitalism to socialism' proposed by Lenin.

In socialist countries, the question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism needs a very long historical period to gradually resolve. The struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism runs through the entire historical period. This struggle is wave-like, sometimes even very fierce. The forms of struggle are varied.

The 1957 Declaration says well: 'For the working class, seizing power is only the beginning of the revolution, not the end of the revolution.'

To deny the class struggle in the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to deny the necessity of thoroughly completing the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, is wrong, does not conform to objective facts, and goes against Marxism-Leninism."

In July 1964, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "In the realm of politics and ideology, the struggle between socialism and capitalism over who will defeat whom will take a very long time to resolve. It will not be enough in a few decades; it will take a hundred to several hundred years to succeed. In terms of time, it is better to prepare for a longer period; in terms of work, it is better to see it as more difficult. This way of thinking and acting is more beneficial and less harmful."

It is under the guidance of this great theory proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong that the vast rural and urban areas of our country have carried out extensive socialist education movements. This movement has achieved brilliant results, solving a number of problems in practice and providing valuable experience for the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

However, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road used the pseudo-leftist, rightist bourgeois reactionary line to oppose Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist line. He distorted the proletarian nature of the socialist education movement, turning it into a struggle between "four cleanses and four uncleanses," shifting the target of struggle, striking a large number of people, and protecting a small number of people, protecting the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, protecting the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, protecting the social base for the restoration of capitalism. He peddled this revisionist goods all over the country, openly attacking Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, attacking Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist mass line and method of investigation and study.

In January 1965, Chairman Mao personally presided over the drafting of the "Some Current Problems in the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside," also known as the "Twenty-Three Points," which is a very important Marxist-Leninist document. This great document smashed the pseudo-leftist, rightist bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the Chinese Khrushchev, scientifically summarized the experience of the socialist education movement, and further enriched and developed the theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In the "Twenty-Three Points," Chairman Mao, for the first time, proposed a very important principle: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

"Those who are taking the capitalist road are in the foreground and in the background." Those who support these power-holders "include those who work in the communes, districts, counties, regions, and even in the provincial and central departments, who oppose the implementation of socialism."

On the basis of the socialist education movement and in the continued struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our great teacher Chairman Mao personally initiated and led an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, systematically solving the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in theory and practice, and reaching the highest peak in the history of Marxism.

"On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" laid the theoretical foundation for the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. After a full ten years of summarizing the experience of class struggle, especially after the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has turned the world upside down this year, Comrade Mao Zedong has contributed the invincible theoretical weapon for the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, contributed the proletarian revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism, contributed a series of correct policies and guidelines, and contributed the correct methods for carrying out this great revolution.

In the great historical document "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" dated May 16, 1966, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counterrevolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." "The Central Committee and the various departments of the Central Committee, the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, all have such a group of bourgeois representatives."

This means that within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is a small handful of bourgeois representatives, a small handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, and it is necessary to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to overthrow them. If this revolution is not carried out, they cannot be overthrown, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, the danger of capitalist restoration cannot be effectively prevented, and the fate of the Soviet Union, where the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the Party and the state, will be repeated.

Our country is a great country of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our Party is a great, glorious, and correct Party. For the past seventeen years, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been dominant within our Party, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, not the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, has been dominant in our country. This is also the case in recent years. This must be firmly affirmed. The power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are only a small handful of people. The dictatorship of the proletariat turning into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is only a problem in some parts, not the whole. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to partially improve the dictatorship of the proletariat and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Some people have raised the slogan of "thoroughly improving the dictatorship of the proletariat," which is wrong. Some people with ulterior motives want to thoroughly negate everything in the past and thoroughly overthrow everything in the past. Their purpose is to use this to lead to the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the implementation of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a revolution under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. All our words and actions must be judged by the standard of Mao Zedong Thought to determine what is correct and what is wrong. Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is the sharp theoretical weapon for the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and is the compass for us to navigate in the great ocean of revolution.

In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao proposed six political criteria for judging various speeches and actions in our political life. Chairman Mao said: "These criteria can be roughly defined as follows: (1) It is beneficial to the unity of all nationalities in the country, not to the division of the people; (2) It is beneficial to the socialist transformation and socialist construction, not detrimental to the socialist transformation and socialist construction; (3) It is beneficial to the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, not to the destruction or weakening of this dictatorship; (4) It is beneficial to the consolidation of democratic centralism, not to the destruction or weakening of this system; (5) It is beneficial to the consolidation of the leadership of the Communist Party, not to the abandonment or weakening of this leadership; (6) It is beneficial to the international unity of socialism and the international unity of all peace-loving peoples in the world, not detrimental to these unities." These six criteria have important guiding significance for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are also the criteria for judging whether all speeches and actions are revolutionary in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The most important of these six criteria are the two criteria of the socialist road and the leadership of the Party." The most important of the great revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is also these two criteria. We must firmly support the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, overthrow the bourgeois headquarters within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly walk the socialist road, and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is precisely to strengthen the leadership of the Party, not to weaken the leadership of the Party. These people, under the pretext of the leadership of the Party, maintain their own bourgeois rule, which is absolutely impossible. They must be overthrown to truly achieve the consolidation of the leadership of the Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong Thought.

To successfully carry out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is necessary to strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of contradictions of different natures. Chairman Mao pointed out: "In front of us, there are two types of social contradictions, namely, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people. These are two types of contradictions of completely different natures." "The methods of solving the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people are different. Simply put, the former is the question of distinguishing between the enemy and us, and the latter is the question of distinguishing between right and wrong."

Chairman Mao's theory of the two types of contradictions is the theoretical foundation of the strategic and tactical thinking of the proletariat defeating the bourgeoisie. Only by correctly distinguishing and handling the two types of contradictions of different natures can we gradually achieve the unity of more than 95% of the masses, the unity of more than 95% of the cadres, and the maximum isolation and attack on a small handful of enemies, and prevent both rightist and "leftist" errors.

The contradictions between the enemy and us are antagonistic contradictions, life-and-death struggles. The overthrown landlord bourgeoisie, unwilling to perish, always try to restore their rule. They place their hopes for restoration on the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into our Party and government organs. The contradictions between the proletariat and this small handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road are the main contradictions that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution needs to solve. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to concentrate forces to attack the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, seize back the power they have usurped into the hands of the proletariat, and thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. This is the direction of the struggle.

The contradictions among the people are generally non-antagonistic, contradictions based on the fundamental unity of the interests of the people. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of complex contradictions among the people have emerged, many of which are essentially contradictions between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, contradictions between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought, petty-bourgeois thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some cadres and leaders of mass organizations, in some issues, have individualism, small-groupism, anarchism, which are manifestations of bourgeois thought, petty-bourgeois thought.

These erroneous thoughts hinder the grasp of the direction of the struggle, hinder the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, hinder the implementation of the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution to seize power, and hinder the direction of the struggle towards the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao criticizes those who have such thoughts as: "It seems that the fewer people, the better, the smaller the circle, the better." Those who hold such small-circleism are opposed to such a thought: "Mobilize all positive factors, unite all possible people, and turn as many negative factors as possible into positive factors."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The ideology of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will definitely be reflected. They will definitely use various means to stubbornly express themselves in political and ideological issues."

Some cadres and some leaders of mass organizations, their positions have changed from being oppressed in the past to being in power. Among them, many people still work hard, diligently, and follow Chairman Mao's instructions to seriously reform their thoughts. However, some people do not pay attention to seizing the power of the "self" in their minds, do not pay attention to constantly using proletarian thought to overcome bourgeois thought and petty-bourgeois thought in their minds, which is very dangerous. Because retaining and even developing bourgeois thought, petty-bourgeois thought, it is absolutely impossible to correctly implement the proletarian revolutionary line, it is inevitable to transform the world according to one's own image, and it is possible to implement the bourgeois reactionary line again.

No matter how complex, the contradictions among the people must be resolved through ideological struggle. This struggle can only be carried out according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." Here, it is first necessary to start from the desire for unity. To overthrow the common enemy, to overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, everyone should unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Only from this desire to unite against the enemy can there be a realistic, benevolent criticism, only then can there be a serious self-criticism, only then can thoughts be clarified, right and wrong be distinguished, and new unity be achieved.

The masses who originally participated in conservative organizations should resolutely draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat should do meticulous political and ideological work on the masses who were deceived into participating in conservative organizations. For those who have corrected their mistakes or are in the process of correcting their mistakes and have participated in conservative organizations, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should welcome them, help them, unite with them, and work together to do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation according to the principle that revolution does not distinguish between early and late comers.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All issues of an ideological nature, all issues of disputes among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, can only be resolved by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive, forceful methods." In handling contradictions among the people, one must persuade with reason, absolutely not with force, with power, absolutely not with the methods of handling contradictions between the enemy and us. When contradictions arise among revolutionary mass organizations, both sides should first seriously and sincerely engage in self-criticism, seek common ground while reserving differences, grasp the direction of the struggle, and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Do not be eager to engage in "internal wars," attack each other, use curses, fists, or smashing, looting, and arson to resolve contradictions among the people. Otherwise, it will inevitably deepen the contradictions, give the enemy an opportunity, and make friends sad and enemies happy. It should be seen that the class enemies are using the contradictions among the people to sow discord, stir up trouble, and attempt to achieve their conspiracies. All revolutionary masses must pay full attention and not be deceived.

The fundamental way to resolve various contradictions among the people is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out rectification movements, rectify thoughts, rectify styles, and rectify organizations. We must carry out self-criticism, break down the "self," establish the "public," use the proletarian worldview to transform thoughts, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and transform everything.

Currently, the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is uneven. Therefore, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in various regions and units should, according to the situation of struggle in their own places and the main problems that exist there, focus on studying Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," summarize work, guide future actions, resolutely achieve and consolidate the great alliance of the revolution, achieve and consolidate the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论武器
    ——纪念《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十期社论
    毛主席在十年前发表的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，是马克思主义发展史上的一篇划时代的光辉文献。
    毛主席在这个光辉文献中，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的唯物辩证法和阶级斗争、无产阶级专政学说。这个文献是无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大纲领，是马克思主义发展到毛泽东思想阶段的一个重要标志。
    这个光辉文献，全面地总结了国内和国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，用无产阶级的辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，来观察和解决社会主义社会的各种问题，在马克思主义发展史上第一次科学地、系统地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，阐明了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，提出了区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，正确处理这两类矛盾的理论、方针和政策。
    当前我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正在乘风破浪胜利前进。现在，学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇伟大著作，结合学习毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和八月八日《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，学习毛主席提出的关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，对于实现无产阶级革命派大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，完成斗批改的任务，具有极其重要的意义。
    在社会主义社会里，生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，实际上承认或否认还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，承认或否认阶级斗争归根到底是争夺政权，是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政而资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政的斗争，这是决定社会主义命运的关键问题。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团对马克思列宁主义最大的背叛，就是制造了“全民国家”、“全民党”的“理论”。按照这种“理论”，在社会主义社会里，矛盾消失了，阶级不见了，阶级斗争不见了，要搞什么“土豆烧牛肉的共产主义”了。他们作为苏联新旧资产阶级的总代表，正是用这种“理论”欺骗人民，向无产阶级进攻，把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，把苏联共产党变成资产阶级政党，在苏联实行资本主义复辟。
    中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，同苏联的赫鲁晓夫们，唱的是一个调子。在我国生产资料的社会主义改造基本完成以后，这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，完全同毛泽东同志唱反调，宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论，说什么“国内敌人已经基本上被消灭”，“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了，或者说基本上解决了，那就是说敌我矛盾已经基本上解决”。
  “以后，革命斗争也没有了，社会主义改造也没有了”。“社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了”，“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”。他的一切政治活动，都贯穿着这一条黑线。他的目的，同苏联的赫鲁晓夫们一样，就是妄图把我国的无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，把中国共产党变成资产阶级政党，在中国实行资本主义复辟。
    毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的学说，正是在同国际的和国内的修正主义进行斗争中发展起来的。
    在我国，生产资料所有制的社会主义改造刚刚基本上完成以后，毛主席就在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇伟大著作中指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”
    毛主席还指出：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就是梦想恢复资本主义制度的总代表。在我国遭受三年自然灾害的时候，他们配合美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的反华大合唱，策动了自上而下的全面的反革命复辟活动。什么“三自一包”，什么“三和一少”，什么合二而一论，什么《海瑞罢官》之类反党反社会主义的作品，纷纷出笼，牛鬼蛇神，一齐跑了出来，刮起一股单干风、翻案风、投降风、自由风。
    一九六二年八月北戴河中央工作会议和九月党的八届十中全会上，毛主席两次具有伟大历史意义的讲话，就是同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的产物，纠正了右倾机会主义路线，刹住了这股资本主义反革命复辟的黑风。在这两次讲话中，毛主席继续发挥了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中的马克思列宁主义的论点，明确地指出：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。要认识这种斗争的长期性和复杂性。要提高警惕。要进行社会主义教育。要正确理解和处理阶级矛盾和阶级斗争问题，正确区别和处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。不然的话，我们这样的社会主义国家，就会走向反面，就会变质，就会出现复辟。我们从现在起，必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，使我们对这个问题，有比较清醒的认识，有一条马克思列宁主义的路线。”
    一九六三年五月，毛主席亲自主持制定了《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》，即第一个十条，提出了开展社会主义教育运动的伟大号召。在这个极其重要的文件中，毛主席向全党和全国人民提出，如果忘记了社会主义社会里的阶级和阶级斗争的话，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。请同志们想一想，这是一种多么危险的情景啊！”
    一九六三年六月十四日，《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》，即二十五条，这个光辉灿烂的马克思列宁主义的文件发表了。这是当代国际共产主义运动的伟大纲领，通篇闪耀着毛泽东思想的光芒。在毛主席亲自主持制定的这个文件中指出：
    “在无产阶级获得政权以后的一个很长的历史时期中，阶级斗争的继续，仍然是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律，只是阶级斗争的形式不同于无产阶级取得政权以前。
    在十月革命以后，列宁多次指出：
    1．被推翻的剥削者，总是千方百计地企图恢复他们被夺去的‘天堂’。
    2．小资产阶级自发势力经常产生新的资本主义分子。
    3．在工人阶级队伍中，在国家机关职员中，由于资产阶级的影响和小资产阶级自发势力的包围和腐蚀作用，也会产生一些蜕化变质分子，新的资产阶级分子。
    4．国际资本主义的包围，帝国主义武装干涉的威胁以及和平瓦解的阴谋活动，是社会主义国家里阶级斗争继续存在的外部条件。
    实际生活证实了列宁以上的论断。
    任何一个社会主义国家，即使在实现了社会主义工业化和农业集体化以后的几十年，甚至更长的时间，都不能说，那里已经完全没有象列宁所反复痛斥过的资产阶级食客、寄生虫、投机倒把者、骗子、懒汉、流氓、盗窃国库者这类分子；也不能说，社会主义国家已经不需要或者可以放弃列宁所提出的‘清除这些由资本主义遗留给社会主义的传染病、瘟疫和溃疡’的任务。
    在社会主义国家里，社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，需要一个很长的历史时期才能逐步解决。社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，贯穿着整个历史时期。这种斗争时起时伏，是波浪式的，有时甚至是很激烈的。斗争的形式是多种多样的。
    一九五七年宣言说得好：‘对于工人阶级说来，取得政权只是革命的开始，而不是革命的终结。’
    否认无产阶级专政时期中的阶级斗争，否认在经济战线上、政治战线上和思想战线上彻底完成社会主义革命的必要性是错误的，不符合客观事实的，违背马克思列宁主义的。”
    一九六四年七月，我们伟大领袖毛主席又教导我们说：“在政治思想领域内，社会主义同资本主义之间谁胜谁负的斗争，需要一个很长的时间才能解决。几十年内是不行的，需要一百年到几百年的时间才能成功。在时间问题上，与其准备短些，宁可准备长些；在工作问题上，与其看得容易些，宁可看得困难些。这样想，这样做，较为有益，而较少受害。”
    正是在毛泽东同志提出的这个伟大的理论指导下，我国广大乡村和城市，开展了广阔的社会主义教育运动。这个运动，取得了辉煌的成果，从实践上解决了一批问题，为无产阶级专政下的革命提供了宝贵的经验。
    可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却用形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，来对抗毛主席的马克思列宁主义路线。他抹煞了社会主义教育运动的无产阶级同资产阶级斗争的性质，把社会主义教育运动歪曲为“四清和四不清的矛盾”，转移斗争目标，打击一大片，保护一小撮，保护党内走资本主义道路的当权派，保护地富反坏右，保护复辟资本主义的社会基础。他在全国到处贩卖这套修正主义货色，公然攻击毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，攻击毛主席的马克思列宁主义的群众路线和调查研究方法。
    一九六五年一月，毛主席亲自主持制定的《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》，即二十三条，是一个非常重要的马克思列宁主义的文件。这个伟大的文件，粉碎了中国的赫鲁晓夫提出的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，科学地总结了社会主义教育运动的经验，进一步丰富和发展了无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论。
    毛主席在二十三条中，第一次提出了一个极其重要的原理：
    “这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。
    “那些走资本主义道路的当权派，有在幕前的，有在幕后的。”支持这些当权派的，“在上面的，有在社、区、县、地、甚至有在省和中央部门工作的一些反对搞社会主义的人。”
    在社会主义教育运动的基础上，在继续同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的针锋相对的斗争中，我们的伟大导师毛主席亲自发动和领导了一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从理论上和实践上系统地解决了无产阶级专政下进行革命的问题，攀登了马克思主义发展史上最新的高峰。
    《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，奠定了无产阶级专政下革命的理论基础，经过整整十年对阶级斗争经验的总结，特别是经过这一年天翻地覆的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，毛泽东同志为无产阶级专政下的革命，贡献了战无不胜的理论武器，贡献了马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命路线，贡献了一系列正确的方针和政策，贡献了正确进行这场大革命的方法。
    毛主席在一九六六年五月十六日中共中央《通知》这个伟大的历史文件中指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”“中央和中央各机关，各省、市、自治区，都有这样一批资产阶级代表人物”。
    这就是说，在无产阶级专政机构内部，有一小撮资产阶级代表人物，有一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，必须发动亿万群众起来革他们的命。如果不进行这个革命，就不能把他们打倒，就不能巩固无产阶级专政，就不能有效地防止资本主义复辟，就会重蹈苏联发生赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡党篡政的覆辙。
    我们国家是伟大的无产阶级专政的国家。我们的党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。十七年来，在我们党内占统治地位的，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，在我国占统治地位的，是无产阶级专政，不是资产阶级专政。近几年来也是这样。这是完全必须肯定的。党内走资本主义道路的当权派，只是一小撮人。无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政的，只是某些部分的问题，而决不是全体。我国无产阶级文化大革命，就是要部分改善无产阶级专政，加强无产阶级专政。有人提出“彻底改善无产阶级专政”的口号，这是错误的。有些别有用心的人，要彻底否定过去的一切，彻底打倒过去的一切，他们的目的，就是要由此导致推翻无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政。
    无产阶级专政下的革命，是在毛泽东思想统帅下的革命。我们的一切言论和行动，都必须以毛泽东思想为标准，来判明那些是正确的，那些是错误的。毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，就是无产阶级专政下革命的锐利的理论武器，就是我们在大革命海洋中航行的方向盘。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中，提出了在我国政治生活中判断各种言论和行动的六条政治标准。毛主席说：“这种标准可以大致规定如下：（一）有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；（二）有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；（三）有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；（四）有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；（五）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；（六）有利于社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。”这六条标准，对于无产阶级文化大革命，具有重要的指导作用，也是在无产阶级文化大革命中判断一切言论、行动是不是革命的标准。
    毛主席教导我们，“这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。”无产阶级专政下的大革命，最重要的也是这两条，必须坚决拥护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，打倒无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部，必须坚决走社会主义道路，打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，正是加强党的领导，而不是削弱党的领导。这些家伙，假借党的领导的名义，来维护他们自己的资产阶级统治，这是绝对办不到的。必须打倒他们，才能真正做到巩固以毛泽东思想为指南的共产党的领导。
    要胜利地进行无产阶级专政下的革命，必须严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾。毛主席指出：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”
    毛主席关于两类矛盾的理论，是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的战略思想和策略思想的理论基础。只有正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，才能逐步达到团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部，最大限度地孤立和打击一小撮敌人，才能防止右的和“左”的错误。
    敌我之间的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾，是你死我活的斗争。被推翻的地主资产阶级，不甘心于灭亡，他们总是企图复辟。他们把复辟的希望，寄托在混入我们党和政权机关内部的资产阶级代表人物身上。无产阶级同这一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是无产阶级文化大革命要解决的主要矛盾。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们篡夺的权力夺回到无产阶级手中，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭。这是斗争的大方向。
    人民内部矛盾，一般说来是非对抗性的，是在人民利益根本一致基础上的矛盾。在无产阶级文化大革命中，出现的大量的错综复杂的人民内部的矛盾，有许多实质上是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的矛盾，无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想的矛盾。在无产阶级文化大革命中，某些干部和群众组织的某些负责人，在一些问题上闹个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义，这些都是资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想的表现。
    这些错误思想，妨碍掌握斗争的大方向，妨碍无产阶级革命派大联合，妨碍实行革命的“三结合”的夺权斗争，妨碍把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    毛主席批评具有这种思想的人是：“似乎人越少越好，圈子紧缩得越小越好。抱有这种小圈子主义的人们，对于这样一种思想是抵触的：调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素”。
    毛主席教导我们：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。”
    某些干部和某些群众组织的负责人，他们的地位发生了变化，从过去受压制的地位，变成当权的地位。其中有许多人仍然埋头苦干，兢兢业业，照毛主席的指示办事，认真改造自己的思想。但是，也有人不注意夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，不注意不断地用无产阶级思想克服自己头脑中的资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想，这是很危险的。因为保存甚至发展资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想，就绝不能正确地执行无产阶级革命路线，就必然要按照自己的面貌来改造世界，就有可能重新执行资产阶级反动路线。
    不管怎样错综复杂，解决人民内部矛盾，要通过思想斗争。这种斗争，只能按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式来进行。在这里，首先需要从团结的愿望出发。为了打倒共同的敌人，打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大家应该在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来，团结起来。只有从这种团结对敌的愿望出发，才会有实事求是的、与人为善的批评，才能有认真的自我批评，才能弄清思想，分清是非，达到新的团结。
    原来参加保守组织的群众，应该坚决和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。无产阶级革命派，对于受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众，要进行细致的政治思想工作。对于已经改正错误或正在改正错误的参加过保守组织的群众，无产阶级革命派应该按照革命不分先后的原则，欢迎他们，帮助他们，团结他们，共同搞好斗、批、改。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”在处理人民内部矛盾时，要以理服人，绝对不能以力服人，以势压人，绝对不能采用处理敌我矛盾的方法。革命群众组织之间，在发生矛盾的时候，双方首先应该认真地诚恳地作自我批评，求大同，存小异，掌握斗争的大方向，在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来。不要热衷于打“内战”，互相攻击，用咒骂，用拳头，用打砸抢来解决人民内部矛盾。那样，势必使矛盾加深，给敌人以可乘之机，为亲者所痛，为仇者所快。应该看到，阶级敌人正在利用人民内部矛盾，挑拨离间，兴风作浪，企图实现他们的阴谋。一切革命群众，务必充分注意，不要上当。
    解决各种人民内部矛盾的最根本办法，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，开展整风运动，整顿思想，整顿作风，整顿组织。要开展自我批评，大破私字，大立公字，用无产阶级世界观改造思想，用毛泽东思想来统帅一切，改造一切。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命的发展是不平衡的。因此，各地区、各单位的无产阶级革命派，要根据自己那里的斗争形势，那里存在的主要问题，有重点地学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇伟大著作，总结工作，指导今后的行动，坚决实现和巩固革命的大联合，实现和巩固革命的“三结合”，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，搞好本单位的斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
