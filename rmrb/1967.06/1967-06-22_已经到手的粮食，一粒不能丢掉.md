The wheat harvested by the second brigade of Mao Fang Production Brigade in Dongyu People's Commune, Nantong County, Jiangsu, has achieved a bumper harvest this year. Recently, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the brigade have studied once again Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and his teaching on "practicing strict economy." Based on the improvement of the masses' ideological level, they inspected the threshed wheat straw in the granary and on the field. At first glance, most of it was threshed clean; upon closer inspection, a few grains of wheat were found embedded in some of the empty husks. This does not conform to Chairman Mao's spirit of "frugality in revolution." They said: The grains that have already been harvested, not a single grain should be wasted. Each grain of rice, each grain of wheat, is a fruit of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some said: The number one capitalist-roader in the Party opposes us poor and lower-middle peasants following Chairman Mao's words, but we must follow Chairman Mao's words and make the quality of the summer harvest better and better.

Thus, everyone took immediate action. After a second round of threshing, they harvested more than four hundred jin of shiny wheat, truly achieving the goal of "every grain to the granary."

The production office of the Nantong County People's Armed Forces accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai entered the banquet hall.

    已经到手的粮食，一粒不能丢掉
    江苏南通县东余公社茂芳大队第二队的麦子，今年获得了大丰收。最近队里的贫下中农和革命干部，又一次学习了毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针和“厉行节约”的教导。在群众思想提高的基础上，他们到仓库和场上检查已经脱粒的麦秸。粗粗一看，绝大部分脱得干干净净；仔细一查，在少数空穗中还嵌着几粒麦子。这不符合毛主席“要节约闹革命”的精神。他们说：已经到手的粮食，一粒也不能丢掉。一颗粮食、一粒麦子，都是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利果实。有的说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反对我们贫下中农听毛主席的话，我们就是要听毛主席的话，要把夏收质量搞得好上加好。
    于是，大家立即行动。经过第二次脱粒，又收了四百多斤金光闪闪的麦子，真正做到了颗粒归仓。
