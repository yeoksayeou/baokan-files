By 1958, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial enterprises in our country, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan hurriedly came out to adapt the script of "Lin Family Shop." Why did he dig up the corpse of Boss Lin from the historical garbage heap? The purpose was clear.

The biggest capitalist-road traitor within the Party, Hu Qiaomu, claimed that the bourgeoisie is not out for profit but "serves the people." Xia Yan faithfully carried out his master's orders, doing everything possible to dress up Boss Lin as a capitalist who "serves the people." To praise this reactionary capitalist's "achievements," he specially had the poor peasant Lao Tongbao sing praises for Boss Lin, saying, "If he opened a grain shop, I would have been saved!" Look, the capitalist has become the savior of the working people!

The biggest capitalist-road traitor within the Party loudly advocated the "unity" of the interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Xia Yan understood his master's intentions and tried every means to depict Boss Lin's shop as a harmonious picture without class struggle, oppression, and resistance: Boss Lin was so caring towards his employees and apprentices; the employees and workers were so obedient to Boss Lin, working hard for him. They shared joys and sorrows, living in harmony.

The biggest capitalist-road traitor within the Party lamented the inevitable failure of the bourgeoisie, saying, "Now many capitalists are feeling uneasy, ... they cannot control their own fate, this is a big problem." Xia Yan followed his master's lead, vividly describing Boss Lin's so-called "misfortunes" and "bankruptcy tragedy" in the film: extortion by Nationalist soldiers, sabotage by competitors, disruption of supply chains, etc. This fully expressed the bourgeoisie's "unease" and "inability to control their own fate," aiming to arouse people's sympathy for the "pitiful" Boss Lins.

Obviously, the Boss Lin in the film "Lin Family Shop" has been given a new political mission by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan. Xia Yan used the "borrowed corpse to return to life" method, through the "bankruptcy tragedy" of Boss Lin in the early 1930s, to express the "suffering" and "misfortune" of the capitalists being transformed in the socialist era; through Boss Lin's mouth, to vent the bourgeoisie's hatred and dissatisfaction with the socialist revolutionary reality under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1958, our country was in a period of profound revolutionary change. We had basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist and commercial enterprises. At this time, who would feel the sense of "bankruptcy" and "tragedy"? The bourgeoisie! They were deeply pained by the loss of their past "paradise." They would seize any opportunity to stir up trouble, attempting to restore capitalism. Listen, the Boss Lin in the film is indignant, complaining about the inability to freely develop capitalism, repeatedly shouting, "There's no way, can't make it," "The money is gone, the shop is empty, it's a dead end!" "What will happen next? How will the shop be run? How will the family live?" etc. Isn't this the voice of the reactionary bourgeoisie who fiercely resisted the socialist transformation at that time?! The hatred and anger of Boss Lins are obviously directed at the proletariat, at the dictatorship of the proletariat. The film so blatantly exaggerates this bourgeois hatred and anger, what does it mean? It is to incite the bourgeoisie to launch a counterattack, to initiate a new attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat. But the wheel of history has crushed their resistance to pieces. They can only place their hopes of restoration on their faithful dog Shou Sheng, to inherit the bourgeois cause, and one day rise again. Xia Yan and his master, the Khrushchev of China, are using the corpse of Boss Lin to boost the morale of the bourgeoisie's counterattack and restoration activities!

With the support of his master, Xia Yan attempted to use the corpse of Boss Lin as a stone to block the historical wheel of socialism advancing on the great road, and make it slide onto the capitalist wrong path. Their dreams have already been shattered. Chairman Mao said: "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism, this is an objective law that does not change with people's will." The fate of China can only be decided by the proletariat and the working people. The wheel of history is not something that a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists can turn around.

    抬出林老板这具僵尸要干什么？
    ——评影片《林家铺子》
    文红兵
    一九五八年，我国资本主义工商业在所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成之后，反革命修正主义分子夏衍急急忙忙跳出来改编《林家铺子》。从历史的垃圾堆里抬出林老板这具僵尸，这是为了什么呢？
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派胡说资产阶级不是唯利是图，而是“为人民服务”的。夏衍忠实地按照主子的意旨办事，千方百计地把林老板打扮成一个“为人民服务”的资本家。为了颂扬这个反动资本家的“功绩”，他特地让贫苦农民老通宝为林老板高唱赞歌，说什么“要是他开粮食店，我早就阿弥陀佛了！”看，资本家简直成了劳动人民的救命菩萨！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大肆宣扬资产阶级与无产阶级利益的“一致性”。夏衍心领神会，在影片中想方设法把林老板的商店描写成没有阶级矛盾，没有压迫和反抗的一幅阶级调和的图画：林老板对店员、学徒是那么关怀备至；店员工人对林老板则俯首贴耳，一心一意替林老板效劳卖力。他们共忧患，同哀乐，和平共处。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为资产阶级必然失败的命运鸣冤叫苦，说什么“现在资本家很多情绪不安，……不能掌握命运，这是个很大的问题。”夏衍紧跟着他的主子跳舞，在影片中淋漓尽致地描写了林老板的所谓“不幸”遭遇和“破产”悲剧：国民党官兵敲诈勒索、同业中伤、货源断绝等等，充分地发泄了资产阶级的“不安”和“不能掌握命运”的“情绪”，以引起人们对“可怜的”林老板们的同情。
    显然，影片《林家铺子》里的林老板已经被反革命修正主义分子夏衍赋予了新的政治使命。夏衍使用“借尸还魂”的手法，通过三十年代初期林老板的“破产悲剧”，来表现社会主义时代正在被改造中的资本家的“苦难”和“不幸”；借林老板之口，来发泄资产阶级对无产阶级专政下的社会主义革命现实的仇视和不满。一九五八年，我国社会正处在一个深刻的革命的大变动时期，我们基本上完成了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。这时候，什么人才有“破产”之感、“悲剧”之痛呢？资产阶级！他们为失去了过去的“天堂”而深感痛苦。他们一有机会就会兴风作浪，妄图复辟资本主义。你听，影片上的林老板愤愤不平，他大诉不能自由发展资本主义之苦，连声叫嚷“没办法，混不下去”，“钱也完了，店也空了，还不是死路一条！”“这以后怎么办？店怎么开？一家人的日子怎么过？”等等。这不正是当时死命抗拒社会主义改造的反动资产阶级的声音吗？！林老板们的仇恨和愤怒显然是针对无产阶级的，针对无产阶级专政的。影片如此露骨地渲染这种资产阶级的愤怒和仇恨，是什么意思呢？就是鼓动资产阶级进行反攻倒算，对无产阶级专政发起新的攻击。但是历史的车轮把他们的反抗轧得粉碎，他们只得把复辟的希望寄托在他们的忠实走狗寿生身上，要他继承资产阶级的事业，有朝一日重整旗鼓，东山再起。夏衍和他的主子中国的赫鲁晓夫就是这样借林老板这具僵尸为资产阶级的反攻倒算和复辟活动鼓劲打气的！
    夏衍在他的主子的支持下，妄图把林老板这具僵尸当作一块石头抛出来，阻挡在社会主义大道上隆隆前进的历史车轮，并使它滑到资本主义的邪道上去。他们的梦想已经落空了。毛主席说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”中国的命运只能由无产阶级和劳动人民来决定，历史的车轮决不是一小撮反革命修正主义分子所能扭转的。
