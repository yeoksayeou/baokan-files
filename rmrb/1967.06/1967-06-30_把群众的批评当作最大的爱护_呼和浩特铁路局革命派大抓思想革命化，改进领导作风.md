The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Hohhot Railway Bureau in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has, since taking power in April, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the ideological transformation of people, seriously improving their leadership style, humbly accepting the opinions of the masses, closely linking with the masses, avoiding special treatment, and not engaging in wasteful spending. They have set an example for all revolutionary staff in the bureau.

In the early days of taking power, the leaders of this organization spent a lot of time in meetings, and the masses criticized them sharply: "You spend all day in meetings, rarely participating in the activities of the masses. If you continue like this, you will become more and more detached from the masses and will eventually be overthrown." The leaders of this organization carefully studied this opinion and found that although the criticism from the masses sounded harsh, it was very reasonable. They then went among the masses to listen to their opinions and found that the masses urgently wanted to know about the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the city. They immediately invited the responsible comrades of the military control committee to give a report on the situation. To regularly and widely listen to the opinions of revolutionary masses, they took turns on duty, allowing other comrades to have more time to participate in activities in their respective departments. In this way, most of the non-full-time comrades were able to balance revolutionary and work duties, strengthening their connection with the masses.

Because the revolutionary faction in power humbly accepted opinions, the revolutionary masses spoke without reservation. Sometimes, the masses' opinions were not entirely appropriate or did not fully align with reality, but they did not rush to explain; they always patiently listened to the end. For example, two leaders of revolutionary organizations returned from outside and walked to the door. A worker outside mistook the car parked there as theirs and criticized them. Although this was a misunderstanding, they took the masses' opinion very seriously, seeing it as a warning bell for the leaders of the revolutionary organization. Some leaders felt deeply that the revolutionary masses dared to criticize and give opinions to them frankly and sharply, which was a good thing. It showed that the masses had strict requirements for their every word and deed, which was the greatest concern. If the comrades in leadership positions did not want to listen to the opinions of the masses and did not actively accept the supervision of the masses, they would gradually become deaf and blind, and would walk the dangerous path of detaching from the masses.

The proletarian revolutionary faction remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses" and, in their work and life, paid attention to blending with the masses and resolutely avoided special treatment. In the previous period, the bureau organized several trips for staff to participate in production in the suburbs. Revolutionary leaders and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations took turns participating. Revolutionary leaders and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations never rode in a car for personal reasons; when going out for meetings or business, they also tried not to ride in a car. The railway bureau organized several get-togethers, and the leaders always gave their tickets to the staff; when there were not enough tickets, they did not watch.

The leaders of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Hohhot Railway Bureau used Mao Zedong Thought to educate revolutionary masses to establish a frugal and plain style. Some staff in the units under the Engineering Department wanted to buy a tape recorder for the convenience of listening to reports and studying. The leaders of the revolutionary group of the Engineering Department used Chairman Mao's thought of "being thrifty to make revolution" to persuade everyone, making them change their original idea.

    把群众的批评当作最大的爱护
    呼和浩特铁路局革命派大抓思想革命化，改进领导作风
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区呼和浩特铁路局的无产阶级革命派，自从四月份掌权以来，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，大抓人的思想革命化，认真改进领导思想作风，虚心听取群众意见，密切联系群众，不搞特殊化，不铺张浪费，为全局广大革命职工树立了榜样。
    这个局的无产阶级革命派领导成员，在掌权初期，开会占时间多了一些，群众对他们提出了尖锐的批评：“你们整天关在屋子里开会，群众的活动你们很少参加。这样下去，你们越来越脱离群众，将来也会被打倒。”这个组织的领导成员认真研究了这个意见，认为群众的批评虽然听起来刺耳，但是很有道理。于是，他们就分头到群众中听取意见，发现群众迫切要求了解当前本市无产阶级文化大革命的情况。他们立即邀请军管会的负责同志作了一次形势报告。他们为了经常普遍地听取革命群众的意见，由委员轮流值班，以便让另一些委员能够多抽出时间回到本部门参加活动。这样，大部分不脱产的委员做到革命和业务工作两不误，密切了同群众的联系。
    由于掌权的革命派虚心听取意见，革命群众更是知无不言。有时有的群众提意见不够恰当，或者不完全符合实际，他们也不急于解释，总是耐心地听完。例如，两个革命组织的负责人从外面回来，走到门口，门外正好停放一辆小轿车。在场的一个职工误认为小轿车是他们乘坐的，就对他们提出了意见。这虽然是误会，但他们十分重视群众的这个意见，认为是给革命组织负责人敲了警钟。有的领导成员深有感受地说：革命群众敢于对我们直率、尖锐地提出批评和意见，这是好事，这说明群众对我们的一言一行，要求都是严格的，这是一种最大的爱护。如果在领导岗位上的同志不愿倾听群众的意见，不主动接受群众的监督，那就会逐渐变成聋子、瞎子，就要走上脱离群众的危险道路。
    无产阶级革命派，牢记毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，在工作和生活上也注意和群众打成一片，坚决不特殊化。前一段时期，局里曾经先后组织几次职工到郊区参加生产劳动。革命领导干部和革命群众组织的负责人，都轮流参加。革命领导干部和革命群众组织的领导成员，从来没有因私事乘坐过一次小汽车；出去开会、办事，也都尽量不乘坐小汽车。铁路局曾经组织过几次联欢会，领导成员总是把票让给职工群众；票少时，他们就不看。
    呼和浩特铁路局无产阶级革命派的领导成员，用毛泽东思想，教育革命群众树立艰苦朴素的作风。这个局工务处所属单位有些职工，为了听报告、学习方便，提出要买录音机。工务处革命小组的负责人就用毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的思想，向大家进行说服教育，使他们改变了原来的想法。
