An important task currently lies before us revolutionary cadres of the proletariat: to conduct extensive, meticulous, and patient ideological and political work among the masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations.

However, some of our revolutionary cadres of the proletariat do not yet fully understand this point. Some even think, "This kind of polite and gentle approach doesn't seem like the behavior of a revolutionary cadre."

What does it mean to act like a revolutionary cadre of the proletariat? Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must not be "polite and gentle" towards the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionists. However, towards our comrades and friends, and towards the masses who have been temporarily deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line, we must not adopt the same attitude we use towards the enemy.

Regarding the ideological problems of our comrades, Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is not effective to vent one's anger and beat someone up." Instead, "we must adopt the attitude of 'curing the sickness to save the patient,' which is the correct and effective method." Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must sit down and persuade those among the masses who have been deceived, doing so sincerely, patiently, and meticulously. If this is also considered "polite and gentle," then this "polite and gentle" attitude is precisely what is needed to "cure the sickness to save the patient." Otherwise, it will lead to "venting one's anger and beating someone up," confusing two different types of contradictions, and pushing our own people to the enemy's side.

Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must have a clear class stance. The clarity of this stance is first and foremost reflected in the strict distinction and handling of two different types of contradictions. On the one hand, we must be ruthless towards the enemy; on the other hand, we must be lenient towards ourselves. By "ruthless towards the enemy," we mean thoroughly exposing them, deeply criticizing them, and resolutely defeating them politically and ideologically, without any leniency. By "lenient towards ourselves," we mean handling matters according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," not engaging in "ruthless struggle and merciless blows," but rather through meticulous and patient persuasive and educational work, helping the deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by being lenient towards ourselves and uniting with all who can be united, can we truly be ruthless towards the enemy, isolating the enemy to the greatest extent and delivering a fatal blow.

When exposing and fighting the enemy, we must be unyielding in our verbal and written attacks; this is what it means to act like a revolutionary cadre of the proletariat. When conducting ideological and political work among our comrades and friends, we must be sincere, enthusiastic, meticulous, and patient; this is also what it means to act like a revolutionary cadre of the proletariat.

Learning to correctly handle contradictions within the people and conducting meticulous and patient persuasive and educational work is an important issue at present. Some revolutionary cadres are not yet familiar with or accustomed to this new problem. "If you don't know how to persuade, then you must learn." Chairman Mao teaches us thus. Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat have always learned to swim while swimming. We can learn how to strike a handful of class enemies, and we can certainly learn how to unite the majority of the masses.

### 对己和，对敌狠

    对己和，对敌狠
    白辛
    目前一个重要的任务，摆在我们无产阶级革命派的面前：对受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众，要进行大量细致耐心的思想政治工作。
    但是，有的无产阶级革命派同志对这一点还不大理解，甚至认为：“这样文质彬彬的，不象个革命派的样子。”
    怎样才象一个无产阶级革命派的样子呢？无产阶级革命派对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和反革命修正主义分子决不能“文质彬彬”；可是对自己的同志和朋友，对一时受了资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，却不能采取同对待敌人一样的态度。
    对待同志的思想上的毛病，毛主席教导我们：“决不是痛快一时，乱打一顿，所能奏效的”。“必须采用‘治病救人’的态度，才是正确有效的方法”。无产阶级革命派对受蒙蔽的群众做思想政治工作，就得要坐下来，说服人家，而且应当是诚恳的，耐心的，细致的。如果说，这也叫“文质彬彬”，那末，这种“文质彬彬”的态度，却正是“治病救人”所需要的。否则，就会“痛快一时，乱打一顿”，就会混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，就会把自己人也推到敌人那边去。
    无产阶级革命派应该有鲜明的阶级立场，这种立场的鲜明性，首先就表现在严格区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。一方面要对敌狠，另一方面还要对己和。所谓对敌狠，就是要彻底揭露他们，深刻批判他们，坚决把他们从政治上、思想上打倒，决不行“宽恕”之道。所谓对己和，就是要按照团结——批评——团结的公式办事，决不搞那种“残酷斗争，无情打击”，而是通过细致耐心的说服教育工作，帮助受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来。只有对己和，团结一切可以团结的人，才能真正做到对敌狠，最大限度地孤立敌人，给以致命的打击。
    在揭露和斗争敌人的时候，口诛笔伐，决不留情，这才象个无产阶级革命派的样子；在对同志和朋友做思想政治工作的时候，诚恳热情，细致耐心，这也才象个无产阶级革命派的样子。
    学会正确处理人民内部矛盾，做细致耐心的说服教育工作，这是当前的一个重要问题。有的革命派同志，对这一新问题还不熟悉，不习惯。“不会说服怎么办？这就要学习。”毛主席这样教导我们。无产阶级革命派从来是在游泳中学习游泳的，我们能够学会如何打击一小撮阶级敌人，也一定能够学会如何团结大多数群众。
