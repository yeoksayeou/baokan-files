	On the eve of the summer harvest, the fields of the Sixth Brigade of Wujie Commune in Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, are filled with a scene of bumper harvest, and everyone is joyous. The militia organization, based on past experiences that during busy seasons, precise harvesting and threshing are often neglected, timely organized all the commune members to study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. At the sharing meeting, everyone unified their thoughts, raised their awareness, and unanimously agreed that to fight a good summer harvest battle this year, we must first fight a good ideological battle.

	The head of the Poor Peasants' Association, Fan Xueyi, said: Although the wheat this year is in good condition, we must learn from last year's lesson of rough harvesting and threshing. Last year, due to incomplete threshing, a lot of wheat rotted, causing considerable losses. This kind of not cherishing the fruits of labor is actually a manifestation of fear of hard work and fear of trouble, which ultimately boils down to the "self" character. This year, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." We must overcome the idea of fearing hard work and trouble, get rid of the "self" character, and let the "public" character take root. We must seize the important link of "precise harvesting and fine threshing," and not waste anything, achieving increased production and income.

	The militia squad leader, Fan Kejian, said: In previous years, during the harvest season, everyone had a big appetite and did not mind losing a bit of grain, thinking it was a small matter. This is very wrong. This is not a small matter; it is a big deal related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." It is related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is related to the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is related to supporting Vietnam and fighting against American imperialism and modern revisionism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In making plans, doing work, and thinking over problems, we must proceed from the fact that China has a population of 600 million." We must firmly remember this teaching. He expressed that in this year's summer harvest, he must ensure that the wheat sheaves are not dragged on the ground when carrying them, regardless of whether the path is far or near, and strive to carry the wheat on the shoulder and not rest on the way. His speech immediately received the approval and support of all the commune members.

	The 65-year-old poor peasant woman, Tao Laotai, followed with her speech. She said: "In the past, during the harvest season, a little waste here and there, a little loss here and there, and a little loss on the way, all added up to a big number. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Embezzlement and waste are grave crimes.' It is not good to let the harvested grain not be brought home. We must understand: every extra pound of grain harvested is equivalent to an extra bit of strength to fight against American imperialism and modern revisionism, and it is equivalent to making an extra contribution to the world revolution." She firmly expressed her determination to lead the elderly and children to pick up wheat stalks in the fields, on the threshing floor, and on the road, and not let a single wheat stalk be lost, ensuring that every grain is stored.

	At the sharing meeting, everyone expressed that during the busy season, we must especially study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. The busier we are, the more we must study, so that we can work on the right points and achieve results.

    南通五接公社六大队夏收前先作思想准备
    保证精打细收颗粒归仓
    本报讯　夏收前夕，江苏省南通县五接公社六大队一片丰收景象，人人喜气洋洋。民兵组织根据以往大忙季节往往容易忽视精收细打的经验教训，及时组织全体社员学习毛主席的有关教导。在讲用会上，大家统一了思想，提高了认识，一致认为：今年要打好夏收这一仗，必须首先打好思想这一仗。
    贫协组长范学礼说：麦子今年长势虽然好，但是必须吸取去年粗收粗打的教训。去年由于脱粒不干净，结果烂掉了很多麦子，造成了不少损失。这样不爱惜劳动成果，实际上是怕吃苦、怕麻烦的表现，归根到底还是一个“私”字作怪。今年我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，一定要克服怕吃苦、怕麻烦的思想，去掉“私”字，让“公”字安家落户。一定要抓住“精收细打”这个重要环节，决不浪费，做到增产增收。
    民兵班长范克俭说：往年到收获季节，大家眼眶大，损失点儿粮食不在乎，认为是小事。这是很不对的，这决不是小事，这是关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”的大事。这是关系到无产阶级文化大革命的大事。是关系到无产阶级专政的大事，是关系到援越抗美，支援世界人民反帝反修的大事。毛主席教导我们：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”，我们一定要牢牢记住这个教导。他表示，在今年的夏收中一定要做到挑麦担尽量不让麦穗在地上拖，不论路远路近，努力做到麦担上肩，途中不休息。他的发言立即得到了全体社员的赞成和支持。
    六十五岁的贫农女社员陶老太接着讲开了。她说：“以往在收获季节，场头场脑浪费一点儿，田里落一点儿，路上损失一点儿，东一点儿，西一点儿，这样合并起来数字就很大了。毛主席教导我们说：‘贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪’。象这样到手的田禾不收到家是很不好的。必须明白：多收一斤粮食就等于多一分跟美帝国主义和现代修正主义作斗争的力量，就等于对世界革命多作一分贡献。”她坚决表示要带领老人、小孩，在场头，在田里，在路上拾麦穗，决不让丢掉一个麦穗，定要做到颗粒归仓。
    在讲用会上，人人表示在大忙季节，特别要活学活用毛主席著作，越忙越要学，这样才能忙到点子上，忙出成绩来。　（钱树森）
