In the midst of the nationwide high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary organizations in the direct organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy held a lively and spirited lecture meeting. Using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they focused on discussing how, after their status has changed, the proletarian revolutionaries can strengthen the transformation of their worldviews and prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology.

Participants included the first political commissar of the Navy, Li Zuopeng, the second political commissar, Wang Hongkun, and the director of the Political Department, Zhang Xiuquan, along with nearly a hundred revolutionary cadres and leaders from the "Red Alliance General Headquarters" and various departments of the Navy's direct organs.

Since the Cultural Revolution, these revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary organizations have united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought together, and achieved victory together. Now, they have gathered again to praise the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively. This lecture meeting was held at a moment when the Navy's Cultural Revolution had achieved decisive victories. Although they had made great achievements in the past struggles, they were not satisfied. In their speeches, they compared themselves to Mao Zedong Thought, self-critically exposed their thoughts, dug out their selfish desires, and fought against arrogance, demonstrating a high level of revolutionary spirit.

Everyone first used Chairman Mao's great theory on correctly handling contradictions among the people to analyze the various contradictions faced by the proletarian revolutionaries after their status had changed. They unanimously agreed that after exposing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the proletarian revolutionaries had changed from a minority to a majority, from a suppressed position to an unoppressed position, which was a tremendous change. However, class struggle had not ended, and the contradiction between us and the enemy remained the principal contradiction, with the possibility of various reversals still existing. At the same time, with the realization of revolutionary great unity, the revolutionary ranks had expanded, and the masses' demands on the proletarian revolutionaries had increased. In this new situation, whether or not to correctly handle the two different types of contradictions, consolidate the great unity, and do well in the struggle-criticism-transformation, the key lies in responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, strengthen the transformation of one's worldview, and further promote the revolutionization of thought.

In the new situation, how to accelerate the revolutionization of thought? Everyone seriously analyzed the specific circumstances of their unit and unanimously agreed that they should start by eliminating the character "arrogance." The leaders of the "Red Alliance General Headquarters" and its affiliated organizations in the direct organs of the Navy had, after their status changed, basically maintained a good style of diligent work, hard work, and connection with the masses. However, some people, with the change in status, also showed some signs of arrogance and self-satisfaction. Some people's sense of superiority emerged, their spirit of investigation and research was not as good as before, their democratic style was poor, their sense of organizational discipline was weak, phenomena of extravagance appeared, their voices became louder when speaking, and thoughts of fame and gain emerged. Some combat organizations began to have some tense relationships, and the atmosphere of unity was not as strong as before. They believed that the arrogant mood currently emerging in the revolutionary ranks, although still in its infancy, was a plague. If not paid attention to, it would spread and cause endless harm. The mood of arrogance and self-satisfaction born out of victory, and the mood of considering oneself a meritorious person, were tendencies that the proletarian revolutionaries should pay attention to, and were great enemies harming the revolution. Whether or not to overthrow the character "arrogance" was a major issue of whether or not to consolidate and expand the achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and whether or not to continue to maintain the bright red color of the proletarian revolutionaries.

Everyone, using the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, seriously analyzed the harmfulness of the character "arrogance" and pointed out:

	Not overthrowing the character "arrogance" would lead to forgetting class struggle, self-satisfaction, and losing vigilance. This would inevitably result in complacency, demoralization, treating live tigers as dead tigers, and treating smiling tigers as good people.

	Not overthrowing the character "arrogance" would lead to deviating from the Party's leadership. With the character "arrogance," one would become self-righteous and act on their own, ignoring the overall situation and lacking a sense of the big picture. They would haggle over and discount Mao Zedong's teachings and the Party's policies and guidelines, supporting what they agree with and resisting what they disagree with. They would execute the correct instructions from their superiors if they agree with them, but "rebel" if they disagree. In this way, they would foster ultra-democracy and anarchism.

	Not overthrowing the character "arrogance" would lead to deviating from the masses. Believing oneself to be the sole revolutionary, the sole leftist, the sole meritorious person, and considering oneself the greatest, treating oneself as Zhuge Liang and the masses as Liu Bei, would suppress different opinions and not listen to the masses' criticisms.

	Not overthrowing the character "arrogance" would lead to deviating from reality. Working in an aloof manner and floating above the ground would develop subjectivism, replacing policies with emotions, replacing scientific analysis with subjective guesses, and replacing revolutionary goals with personal interests.

	Not overthrowing the character "arrogance" would destroy unity. Within revolutionary organizations, practicing one-person rule and blind command would destroy democratic centralism; between revolutionary organizations, creating factions and engaging in internal strife, treating neighbors as enemies, and recognizing friends as enemies.

	Not overthrowing the character "arrogance" would lead to degeneration and transformation. It would lead to seeking power and fame, wanting to show off in every matter, always wanting others to give them a "sweet date." It would lead to appreciating others' flattery, pursuing personal enjoyment, completely forgetting the revolutionary tradition of hard work and struggle, and completely ignoring the principle of "frugality for revolution."

	In summary, if the character "arrogance" is not overthrown, individualism, parochialism, small-groupism, commandism, dispersism, sectarianism, and anarchism, and other bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts would greatly develop. As a result, the proletarian revolutionaries would not only fail to maintain their revolutionary nature but might even turn to their opposite; they would not only fail to continue to consolidate and expand their victories but might even lose the victories they had already achieved.

Everyone believed that in the face of victory, the proletarian revolutionaries still faced two prospects: one prospect was to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, maintain a clear mind and a humble, prudent, and hardworking style, and carry the revolution through to the end; the other prospect was to be intoxicated by victory, become arrogant due to merit, stagnate, and take the wrong path.

Everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's earnest teachings on the eve of national victory. Chairman Mao said: "Because of victory, there may be arrogance within the Party, the mood of considering oneself a meritorious person, the mood of stagnation and not seeking progress, the mood of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life. Because of victory, the people will thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery, however, may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be such communists who have not been conquered by the enemy with guns, who are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." Everyone unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's important instruction deeply summarized the historical lessons of the past and present, both at home and abroad, and is forever the motto of revolutionary soldiers. The proletarian revolutionaries, especially those in the situation of victory, must always use Chairman Mao's instructions to warn themselves. They must resolutely avoid repeating the mistakes of some people in the past who, due to arrogance and self-satisfaction, degenerated and transformed, and strive not to make mistakes, to make fewer mistakes, and to avoid making big mistakes.

Everyone believed that the mood of arrogance and self-satisfaction was a manifestation of the bourgeois worldview and a manifestation of the infiltration of bourgeois ideology into the revolutionary ranks. Its root was still the character "selfishness." The character "selfishness" was a "chameleon," a "white-boned demon," and the character "arrogance" was its fox tail revealed under the current conditions. They must seize the character "arrogance" as a live target, fiercely fight against selfish desires, and fiercely dig out the roots of selfishness. The fight against selfishness must be a thorough one, not a superficial one. The proletarian revolutionaries, since they dared to stand up and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, must also dare to fiercely touch their souls and overthrow various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds. Only by overthrowing various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds can they raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, emphasize proletarian politics, and better grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly complete the great task of struggle-criticism-transformation. Everyone decided to advance in the high tide of studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," deepen the rectification movement, and launch a decisive battle against selfishness and public-mindedness.

In his concluding speech, the first political commissar of the Navy, Li Zuopeng, emphasized: The Navy's Cultural Revolution has achieved significant victories, but it is only an initial victory. Winning the victory was not easy, and consolidating and expanding the victory is even more difficult. Whether or not we can consolidate and expand the victory, whether or not we can ensure that the leadership of the proletariat will not be snatched away by the bourgeoisie, depends on whether we truly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and whether we truly use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our thoughts. He called on everyone, in the process of deeply studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and carrying out rectification, to use Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause with five conditions, and Comrade Lin Biao's three instructions on raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and having revolutionary spirit, to strictly demand of themselves, compare and examine themselves, and put them into practice. They should learn from the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, regard the problems mentioned there as major political principles, resolutely eliminate the character "arrogance," resolutely overcome the character "selfishness," and become good successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, advancing bravely along the revolutionary path opened up by Chairman Mao!

    把伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作作为武器  加强改造世界观防止资产阶级思想侵蚀
    海军革命领导干部和革命组织负责人等举行《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》讲用会
    据新华社二十六日讯  在全国大学大用毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的高潮中，中国人民解放军海军直属机关无产阶级革命派，举行了一次生动活泼的讲用会。革命领导干部、革命组织负责人等以毛主席这部光辉著作为武器，针对着海军文化大革命的大好形势，着重畅述了无产阶级革命派在地位发生变化后，如何加强世界观的改造，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的问题。
    参加讲用会的有海军第一政治委员李作鹏，第二政治委员王宏坤和政治部主任张秀川等革命领导干部，海军直属机关“红联总”所属组织的负责人和各部门革命干部近百人。
    自文化大革命以来，这些革命领导干部和革命组织的领导骨干，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。现在，他们又欢聚一堂，一起颂扬光焰无际的毛泽东思想，一起大学大讲大用毛主席著作。这次讲用会是在海军无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利时刻召开的，他们在过去的斗争中虽然作出了很大成绩，但是并不满足。他们在发言中对照毛泽东思想，以严格的自我批评精神，主动亮思想，挖“私”心，斗“骄”字，表现了很高的革命风格。
    大家首先运用毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的伟大学说，分析了无产阶级革命派的地位发生变化后所面临的各种矛盾。一致认为，从揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以后，无产阶级革命派从少数变成多数、从受压制的地位变成了不受压制的地位，这是天翻地覆的大变化。但是阶级斗争并未因此结束，敌我矛盾仍然是主要矛盾，出现各种反复的可能性仍然存在。同时，由于实现了革命的大联合，革命的队伍扩大了，群众对无产阶级革命派的要求更高了。在这种新形势下，能否正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，巩固大联合，搞好斗批改，决定的关键是响应林副主席的号召，提高革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，加强自己的世界观的改造，进一步促进思想革命化。
    在新形势下，加速思想革命化，究竟从哪里下手？大家认真分析了本单位的具体情况，一致认为，要从打掉“骄”字下手。海军直属机关“红联总”及所属组织的负责人，在地位发生变化后，基本上保持了兢兢业业、埋头苦干、联系群众的好作风。但是有些人随着地位的变化也流露出了一些骄傲自满情绪。有的优越感出来了，调查研究精神不如以前了，民主作风差了，组织纪律观念薄弱了，大手大脚的现象出现了，说话嗓门高了，名利思想露头了，有的战斗组织开始有些关系紧张，团结的空气不如以前浓了。他们认为，目前在革命队伍中流露出来的骄傲情绪，尽管还处于萌芽状态，但是它是一种瘟疫，稍不注意，它就会滋长蔓延，祸害无穷。因为胜利而产生的骄傲自满、功臣自居的情绪，是当前无产阶级革命派值得注意的一种倾向，是危害革命的大敌。要不要打倒“骄”字，是要不要巩固和扩大文化大革命胜利成果的大问题，是能不能继续保持无产阶级革命派的鲜红颜色的大问题。
    大家以光焰无际的毛泽东思想为武器，认真分析了“骄”字的危害性，指出：
    不打倒“骄”字，就会忘记阶级斗争，沾沾自喜，丧失警惕。这就必然出现麻痹轻敌，涣散军心，把活老虎当死老虎，把笑面虎当好人。
    不打倒“骄”字，就会脱离党的领导。有了“骄”字，就会自以为是，自作主张，就会不顾大局，不识大体，对毛主席的教导，对党的方针政策讲价钱、打折扣，合意的就拥护，不合意的就违抗，对上级的正确指示，合意的就执行，不合意的就“造反”，这样，就会滋长极端民主化和无政府主义。
    不打倒“骄”字，就会脱离群众。唯我独革、唯我独左，以“老左派”、“老正确”、“老功臣”自居，“老子天下第一”，把自己当“诸葛亮”，把群众当“阿斗”，就会压制不同意见，听不得群众的批评。
    不打倒“骄”字，就会脱离实际。高高在上，工作飘浮，就会发展主观主义，以感情代替政策，以主观臆断代替科学分析，以个人利益模糊革命目标。
    不打倒“骄”字，就会破坏团结。在革命组织内部搞“一言堂”，“瞎指挥”，破坏民主集中制；在革命组织之间闹意气，闹宗派，打“内战”，以邻为壑，认友作敌。
    不打倒“骄”字，就会蜕化变质。就会争权位，出风头，遇事总想“露”一手，总想人家给个“甜枣吃”。就会欣赏人家的捧场，追求个人的享受，把艰苦奋斗的革命传统忘得一干二净，把“节约闹革命”的原则完全置之脑后。
    总之，如果不打倒“骄”字，就会使个人主义、本位主义、小团体主义、命令主义、分散主义、宗派主义、无政府主义等资产阶级、小资产阶级思想大大发展起来。其结果，无产阶级革命派不仅不能保持革命的本色，反而可能走向自己的反面；不仅不能继续巩固和扩大胜利，而且有丢失已经取得的胜利的危险。
    大家认为，在胜利的形势下，无产阶级革命派仍然面临着两个前途：一个前途是，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续保持清醒的头脑和谦虚谨慎、艰苦奋斗的作风，把革命进行到底；一个前途是胜利冲昏头脑，居功骄傲，停顿不前，走上错误的道路。
    大家重温了毛主席在全国胜利前夕的谆谆教导。毛主席说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”大家一致认为，毛主席的这个重要指示最深刻地概括了古今中外的历史教训，永远是革命战士的座右铭。处在胜利形势下的无产阶级革命派，尤其要时刻用毛主席的指示给自己敲警钟。坚决避免重蹈过去某些人由骄傲自满走向蜕化变质的覆辙，力争不犯错误、少犯错误，避免犯大错误。
    大家认为，骄傲自满情绪，是资产阶级世界观的表现，是资产阶级思想侵蚀革命队伍的表现。它的根子，还是一个“私”字。“私”字是“变色龙”，是“白骨精”，“骄”字就是它在当前条件下露出来的狐狸尾巴。一定要抓住“骄”字这个活靶子，狠斗私心，狠挖私根。对私字的斗争，要“拔萝卜”，不能“割韭菜”。无产阶级革命派，既然敢于挺身而出打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，也一定要敢于狠触灵魂，打倒自己头脑中的各种非无产阶级思想。只有打倒自己头脑中的各种非无产阶级思想，才能更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席无产阶级革命路线，突出无产阶级政治，才能更好地掌握斗争大方向，彻底完成一斗二批三改的伟大任务。大家决心在学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的革命高潮中，乘胜前进，深入开展整风活动，打一场破私立公的歼灭战。
    海军第一政治委员李作鹏在会上作了总结性发言。他强调指出：海军的文化大革命，已经取得了重大胜利，但又是初步的胜利，夺取胜利不容易，巩固和扩大胜利更不容易。能不能巩固和扩大胜利，能不能保证无产阶级的领导权不再被资产阶级夺过去，就看我们是不是真正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是不是真正用毛泽东思想来统一自己的思想。他号召大家，在深入学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、开展整风的过程中，还要用毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人五个条件的指示，林副主席关于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，有革命干劲的三条指示，严格要求自己，对照检查自己，并身体力行。要学习《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，把那里所说的问题，看作是重大政治原则问题。坚决去掉“骄”字，坚决克服“私”字，当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
