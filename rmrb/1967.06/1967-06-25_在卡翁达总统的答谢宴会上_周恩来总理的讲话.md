Your Excellency President Kenneth David Kaunda and Mrs. Kaunda, Distinguished Guests from Zambia, Friends, Comrades:

Please allow me to express my gratitude, on behalf of my colleagues and in my personal capacity, for inviting us to this grand farewell banquet.

Tomorrow, Your Excellency President Kaunda and Mrs. Kaunda, along with the entire delegation from Zambia, will depart Beijing to visit other parts of our country. Although your stay in our capital has been brief, just four days, your visit has been fruitful. We have exchanged views on international issues of mutual concern, which has greatly enhanced our mutual understanding. We have conducted friendly and sincere discussions on further developing bilateral relations, achieving satisfactory results. We have signed an economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Zambia. All these indicate that Your Excellency's visit has not only opened a new chapter in the friendly cooperative relations between China and Zambia but has also made a new contribution to the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

I appreciate the many friendly words you spoke just now. We believe that although China and Zambia are separated by vast distances, we have always supported and encouraged each other in our common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. For several years, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to the "Five Principles for China's Relations with African Countries" and the "Eight Principles for China's Foreign Economic and Technical Aid," developing friendly relations with Zambia and other African countries. We are delighted to see that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, especially after Your Excellency's visit, our friendly cooperative relations have developed significantly on the basis of these principles.

During your stay in Beijing, Your Excellency and the distinguished guests from Zambia have visited people's communes, schools, and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. You have not only witnessed the development of our production but have also personally interacted with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the Red Guards, who are vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, taken an active interest in state affairs, and thrown themselves into this magnificent cultural revolution to prevent the restoration of capitalism in our country. They have launched a great criticism movement against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. In the revolutionary struggle, they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, further realizing the revolutionization of their thinking. A new high tide of the nationwide movement to study Chairman Mao's works is surging forward. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution marks that our socialist revolution has entered a new, deeper, and broader stage. It is the most reliable guarantee that our Party and state will never change color. Our billion people, especially the younger generation, after being tempered in this revolutionary storm and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have greatly enhanced their ability to resist the infiltration of revisionist ideology. They will be educated to be even better than our generation, possessing more proletarian internationalism. They will become the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in our country. They will definitely build our country into an even more prosperous socialist state, thereby further strengthening our support for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

For this reason, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are terrified and hateful of the progress of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the tremendous influence of Mao Zedong Thought. They have used every means to try to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. The recent brutal suppression by British imperialism in Hong Kong against our patriotic compatriots is a major exposure of this plot.

Everyone knows that under the influence and impetus of the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have launched a high tide of learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. To sabotage and obstruct the mass movement of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong to learn and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have carried out a series of large-scale brutal suppressions against our patriotic compatriots. Just yesterday, they shot and killed a worker and illegally arrested dozens of people. All this has inevitably provoked the strong resistance of our patriotic compatriots. Our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely fought against the British imperialists, and launched a magnificent mass movement of hatred, contempt, and scorn towards British imperialism, thoroughly exposing the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong over more than a hundred years. The working class, youth students, farmers, fishermen, and other patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are further uniting and organizing, forming a vast anti-imperialist and anti-violence army. Today, they have begun a grand-scale anti-imperialist and anti-violence strike, and we express our resolute support.

Hong Kong and Kowloon have always been Chinese territory. The legitimate rights of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, especially their sacred right to learn and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, must not be infringed upon by anyone. The Chinese people, who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is shaking the world, will absolutely not tolerate the brutal persecution of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong by British imperialism. The Chinese people are determined to provide all possible support to our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong according to the needs of the situation until final victory is achieved. The fate of Hong Kong depends on the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people, and not on a handful of British imperialists. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must wake up. If the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong persist in their delusion, ignore the warnings of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, and continue to brutally suppress our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, insisting on making enemies with the Chinese people to the end, then they will inevitably face greater punishment and must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

Your Excellency, distinguished guests from Zambia, before concluding my speech, I would like to express my gratitude once again for the friendship you have brought from the people of Zambia. At the same time, please convey the fighting friendship and good wishes of the 700 million Chinese people to all the people of Zambia.

To the friendship between China and Zambia,
To the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa,
To the health of President Kenneth David Kaunda and Mrs. Kaunda,
To the health of all distinguished guests from Zambia,
To the health of the ambassadors and their spouses present,
To the health of comrades and friends,

Cheers!

    在卡翁达总统的答谢宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达总统阁下和夫人，尊敬的赞比亚全体贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    请允许我代表我的同事们，并且以我自己的名义，感谢你们邀请我们参加今天这个盛大的告别宴会。
    明天，卡翁达总统阁下和夫人以及全体赞比亚贵宾们就要离开北京到外地去访问了。总统阁下和贵宾们这次在我国的首都虽然只有短短四天的逗留，但是，你们的访问是富有成效的。我们双方就共同关心的国际问题交换了意见，大大增进了我们的相互了解。我们双方就进一步发展两国关系的问题，进行了友好诚挚的会谈，取得了圆满的结果。我们双方签订了一项中国赞比亚经济技术合作协定。这一切都充分说明，总统阁下的这次访问，不仅为中赞两国友好合作关系的发展开创了一个新的阶段，而且为亚非人民团结事业作出了新的贡献。
    感谢总统阁下刚才讲的许多友好的话。我们认为，中国和赞比亚虽然远隔万里，但是，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，我们从来是相互支援、相互鼓舞的。几年以来，中国政府一直坚持不渝地根据“中国处理同非洲国家相互关系的五项原则”和“中国政府对外提供经济技术援助的八项原则”，发展中国同赞比亚和非洲国家的友好关系。我们很高兴地看到，自从我们两国建交以来，特别是在总统阁下这次访问以后，我们的友好合作关系在上述原则的基础上有了重大发展。
    总统阁下和全体赞比亚贵宾们在北京期间，参观了人民公社、学校和中国人民解放军的部队。你们不仅看到了我们生产发展的景象，而且亲自接触了正在胜利地进行着文化大革命的广大工农兵群众和红卫兵。他们热烈响应毛主席的号召，关心国家大事，为防止资本主义在我国复辟，积极投入了这场轰轰烈烈的文化大革命，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开展了大批判运动。在革命斗争中，他们活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，进一步实现了思想的革命化。一个全国人民大学毛主席著作运动的新高潮正在掀起。这场无产阶级文化大革命，标志着我国社会主义革命已经发展到了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。它是使我们党和国家永不变色的最可靠保证。我国亿万群众，特别是青年一代，经过了这场革命风浪的锻炼，有了毛泽东思想为武器，大大增强了抵抗修正主义思想的侵蚀的能力，他们将会被教育得比我们这一代还要好，更具有无产阶级国际主义精神。他们将成为我国无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。他们一定能把我国建设成为一个更加富强的社会主义国家，从而更加增强我国支援亚非人民反帝革命斗争的力量。
    正是因为这个缘故，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对我国无产阶级文化大革命的进展和毛泽东思想的巨大影响，怕得要命，恨得要死。他们用尽各种方法，妄图阻遏毛泽东思想的传播。最近英帝国主义在香港对我爱国同胞的残暴镇压，就是这种阴谋的大暴露。
    大家都知道，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的影响和推动下，香港爱国同胞掀起了一个学习和宣传毛泽东思想的高潮。为了破坏和阻止香港爱国同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想的群众运动，英国政府和香港英国当局对我爱国同胞进行了一系列大规模的残酷镇压。就在昨天，又开枪打死了一名工人，非法逮捕了数十人。所有这些，不能不激起我爱国同胞的强烈反抗。香港爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同英帝国主义者英勇搏斗，并且发动了一场轰轰烈烈的仇视、鄙视和蔑视英帝国主义的群众运动，彻底揭露英帝国主义一百多年来在香港所犯下的滔天罪行。香港的工人阶级、青年学生、农民、渔民以及其他爱国同胞正在进一步团结起来，组织起来，结成浩浩荡荡的反帝抗暴大军。今天，他们开始了一场规模宏伟的反帝抗暴大罢工，我们表示坚决的支持。
    香港和九龙历来就是中国的领土。香港爱国同胞的一切正当权利，特别是他们学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，绝对不容许任何人侵犯。在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，取得了伟大胜利的中国人民，绝对不能容忍英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞的残酷迫害。中国人民决心根据形势的需要，给予香港爱国同胞以一切支援，直到取得最后胜利。香港的命运取决于香港的爱国同胞和七亿中国人民，而绝不取决于一小撮英帝国主义者。英国政府和香港英国当局必须放清醒些。如果英国政府和香港英国当局执迷不悟，不顾中国人民和中国政府的警告，继续对香港爱国同胞进行残暴镇压，硬要同中国人民为敌到底，那么，他们就必然要受到更大的惩罚，他们应当承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    尊敬的总统阁下，赞比亚的贵宾们，在结束我的讲话之前，我再一次感谢您带来的赞比亚人民的友谊，同时，请您也把七亿中国人民的战斗友谊和友好祝愿带给全体赞比亚人民。
    为中赞两国的友谊，
    为亚非各国人民的团结，
    为肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达总统阁下和夫人的健康，
    为全体赞比亚贵宾们的健康，
    为在座的各位使节和夫人的健康，
    为同志们和朋友们的健康，
    干杯！（附图片）
