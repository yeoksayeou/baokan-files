Edition: 2

Our great leader Chairman Mao said as early as June 1958: "To produce a few atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is entirely possible in ten years."

The clock of history has struck according to the wise and great prophecy of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!

A moment that shook the world has arrived!

A new chapter in China's nuclear tests has opened!

This is a great triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the clouds!

The Earth-Shaking Roar

As the sun rose and the sky was filled with radiant light, on the morning of June 17, 1967, a solemn and vibrant red flag with five stars was hoisted high in the sky over a western region of our great motherland! Following this, four large red balloons soared swiftly into the blue sky, each carrying banners with red characters:

"Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"
"Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"
"Long live the great Communist Party of China!"
"Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The test site was adorned with plaques bearing quotations from Chairman Mao, red flags fluttering, forming a vast red sea. Above the red sea, a giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao was prominently displayed, flanked by large-character banners: "Chairman Mao, the reddest sun in our hearts, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Our military personnel, workers, engineering and technical staff, scientists, and all participants in the test, in this crucial moment before the test, repeatedly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "We need a passionate yet calm mood, and tense yet orderly work." "Our responsibility is to the people." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, suppressing their intense excitement, and worked accurately according to the predetermined operational sequence. The personnel at the main control station conducted a final check on all instruments, rigorously inspecting every screw, every electronic component, every wire, and every solder joint, ensuring that the equipment was completely reliable.

These instruments placed on-site could accurately record various data during the test. This test not only measured the situation of the hydrogen bomb explosion with various instruments and equipment but also arranged a large number of test items.

All preparations were complete. The personnel at the main control station opened the control panel, signals flashed, machines operated, the protective squad soldiers donned protective clothing and masks, observers entered the observation platform, and the announcer began broadcasting...

The moment that shook the world had arrived.

Suddenly, a blinding flash filled the sky, and a fiery ball of flames surged. A deafening roar echoed, and the fireball disappeared, replaced by a mushroom-shaped cloud rising into the sky. China's first self-designed and self-manufactured hydrogen bomb had successfully exploded!

Instantly, the entire test site erupted in joy. People, filled with immense joy and excitement, sang and danced! With tears of excitement, they waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" They sang "The East Is Red" and songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Sing out in joy! Sing out in triumph! The resounding shouts of victory, the reading of quotations, and revolutionary songs intertwined into a grand triumphant song.

This hydrogen bomb test was conducted under the deep concern of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao.

The success of this hydrogen bomb test is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao on the scientific front. This victory shatters the revisionist line pursued by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road on the scientific front.

The success of this hydrogen bomb test is the great achievement of our military personnel, workers, engineering and technical staff, and scientists, who actively responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, and put Mao Zedong's works into practice! It is the result of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," self-reliance, striving for progress, collective wisdom, and great cooperation!

The success of this hydrogen bomb test once again proves that the Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are the bravest and most intelligent. With the spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought, we can create material atomic and hydrogen bombs, achieve any miracle on earth, and be invincible forever!

The success of this hydrogen bomb test is a heavy blow to the attempts by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to collude and implement nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. For the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, for the Arab people who are resisting the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism and their tool Israel, and for all revolutionary people around the world, it is a great encouragement and support.

Leaping Steps

While the revolutionary people of the world are cheering our great achievements, imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are raging and cursing maliciously. They hate every one of our achievements and try to belittle every one of our victories.

But the enemy's attempts are like a grasshopper blocking a chariot, destined to perish. We will not slow down our steps because of the enemy's curses. Instead, because the great Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly grasped by the broad revolutionary masses, our national defense science and technology are advancing by leaps and bounds.

A soldier who participated in the hydrogen bomb test said well: "As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we can produce atomic and hydrogen bombs."

All the victories of China's national defense science and technology research have been achieved under the care and guidance of Chairman Mao.

To produce a few atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is entirely possible in ten years.

This was the great call to action issued by our great leader Chairman Mao in 1958 regarding national defense science and technology research.

This great battle cry, like a spring thunder, quickly spread to our military personnel, workers, engineering and technical staff, scientists, and all relevant personnel engaged in nuclear weapon research and testing. They posted Chairman Mao's wise instructions on the walls of their workplaces, wrote them in their diaries, and engraved them in their hearts.

They said: "Chairman Mao's great call expresses the wishes of 700 million Chinese people and speaks for our hearts. With the great Mao Zedong Thought and the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome, no scientific and technological fortress we cannot conquer."

They said: "Chairman Mao's great call is a severe blow to the right-opportunist line of capitulationism, crawling, and revisionism pushed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These people, yielding to the pressure of imperialism and revisionism, have been constantly blowing cold winds, pouring cold water, and spreading the wind of demobilization on our national defense science and technology research, trying every means to restrict and cancel national defense science and technology research. With Chairman Mao's great call, we can better fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and against various conservative thoughts, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Chairman Mao's great call is a battle mobilization order, rallying the millions of soldiers on the scientific front to march towards the forefront of world science. The broad masses have displayed boundless wisdom and strength, displaying high courage and fighting spirit, and have launched the "attack on the peak."

The atomic bomb containing thermonuclear materials exploded successfully!

The missile nuclear weapon was launched successfully!

Nuclear weapon tests succeeded one after another!

After our fifth nuclear test succeeded, the struggle between two lines on the speed of nuclear weapon tests became more prominent. Some people were afraid, lacked ambition, and could not see the revolutionary enthusiasm and pioneering spirit unleashed by the broad revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They hesitated and wavered in the face of certain difficulties, trying to postpone this test. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses said: "Chairman Mao calls on us to grasp the revolution and promote production. Can we still crawl slowly like this? No! A million times no!"

They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions. They said:

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your words are shining with golden light, giving us limitless confidence and strength. We proletarian revolutionaries will follow your words word for word and sentence for sentence, and we will stand firm even in the face of the greatest difficulties!"

They held the Little Red Book tightly, confidently refuted various wrong thoughts, and loudly proposed the slogan: "Conduct the hydrogen bomb test ahead of schedule and dedicate it to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The speed of theoretical design relates to the progress of the entire work. At that time, someone said in a discouraged tone: "To conduct it ahead of schedule? It's not that simple." The young rebels replied firmly: "Theoretical design, model design, whenever you need it, we will complete it." The young rebels worked day and night, rushed to complete the theoretical design a month ahead of schedule.

To speed up, we must first remove the obstacles on the path forward. At that time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road were pushing economicism, creating contradictions among workers and technicians, and exerting various pressures on the revolutionary rebels. The revolutionary rebels in the bomb-making unit remembered Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to be "pioneers in grasping the revolution and models in promoting production," stood tall, and took on the heavy responsibility of manufacturing hydrogen weapons ahead of schedule, striding forward to face the difficulties.

According to the old methods, one had to wait for the complete design to be finished before starting construction. The young rebels learned from Chairman Mao's teachings about "having discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," summarized the experiences of past technical finalizations, broke free from foreign frameworks, old frameworks, and rigid frameworks, dared to innovate; designed and constructed simultaneously, closely combining theory with practice, greatly accelerating the speed. China's first hydrogen bomb was manufactured and successfully completed according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

The bomb-making workers and technicians were racing against time, and all participants in the test were also racing against time.

A certain technical unit, to save time, broke the convention of relying on factories to assemble instruments and assembled the required instruments themselves, saving more than twice the time compared to the past. The engineering troops fully utilized the collective wisdom, creating more than ten machines, greatly improving work efficiency and accelerating the progress of the project. A certain unit had a technician who was given a highly demanding and urgent task by the leadership. He remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, worked and researched with the workers during the design and construction, and completed the task ahead of schedule. They followed the requirements of Vice Chairman Lin to strive for revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. Fast, but not hasty, not careless, not reckless, as they put it, everything in scientific experiments must be "stable and reliable, foolproof."

"Countless things are urgent; the earth turns, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment."

Countless test participants were racing against time.

Countless machines were spinning rapidly.

Every department, every post, every person's spirit of "striving for every moment" merged into a great achievement—we successfully conducted the hydrogen bomb test.

From October 1964, when China successfully detonated its first atomic bomb, to this successful hydrogen bomb test, it took only two years and eight months. In comparison, the United States took seven years and four months, the Soviet Union took four years, and Britain took four years and seven months. Our speed is the fastest in the world.

No force in the world can stop the great Chinese people from advancing.

A Broad Path

A young scientist in our military firmly and proudly said: "Climbing the peak of science and technology, although it is winding and dangerous, as long as we remember Chairman Mao's teachings, be self-reliant and strive for progress, we can blaze our own trail. The success of our atomic and hydrogen bomb tests is the most powerful proof."

This young scientist spoke for everyone. Self-reliance and striving for progress are words shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, containing immense spiritual power and boundless creative force.

Chairman Mao said: "Our policy should be based on what? Based on our own strength, that is self-reliance." He also said: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We rely on our own efforts, rely on the creativity of all military and civilian personnel." Our military personnel, workers, engineering and technical staff, and scientists followed Chairman Mao's great instructions, set ambitious goals, dared to tread paths where others had not, and dared to scale peaks where others had not. Starting from scratch, they created everything from nothing. How much labor we had to pay to advance every step! How much arduous struggle we had to endure! We had to fight against the revisionist line pushed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road on the scientific front; we also had to fight against the blockade, obstruction, and sabotage by U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Scientists and workers, with a spirit of defiance, followed Chairman Mao's instructions of self-reliance and striving for progress, adopting the method of "three-in-one combination" of scientific and technical personnel, workers, and leaders, daring to think and act. Yes, the Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future.

We not only have our own atomic bombs and missiles but also successfully detonated our own hydrogen bomb in just two years and eight months.

Our self-designed and self-manufactured hydrogen bomb is completely successful.

To successfully complete this large-scale cutting-edge scientific test, our military personnel, workers, engineering and technical staff, and scientists displayed the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, manufacturing a large number of instruments and equipment. Special mention should be made of the young scientific and technical personnel and workers of the unit responsible for the entire field automatic control system, known as the "nerve center" of the test site, who designed, manufactured, installed, and debugged new and advanced automatic control equipment. For several months, they denounced and criticized the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road while conducting design research, experiments, and trials. Work! Work! They forgot sleep and food, spending countless sleepless nights!

In the trial process, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, using the perspective of dialectical materialism, summarizing and improving with each step of practice. They firmly believed that knowledge comes from practice, and practice is the only criterion for testing truth, daring to conduct multiple repeated experiments, finally achieving success.

In this hydrogen bomb test, this set of new and advanced automatic control equipment, in the instant of the hydrogen bomb explosion, drove thousands of testing instruments to act according to the predetermined plan without a second's delay; it connected all lines in the field into an organic whole, meeting the requirement of "stable and reliable, foolproof," successfully playing the role of the "nerve center."

When the leadership and the masses praised their technical prowess, they said: "People listen to Chairman Mao's words, and machines listen to people's words. Chairman Mao's works have given us direction, brought wisdom, and added boundless strength."

Collective Creation

The creative power of the masses is boundless, and the masses are the masters of science and technology. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao instructed: "We must cooperate greatly and do this work well." The success of China's hydrogen bomb explosion is precisely the brilliant achievement of great cooperation and collective creation, the brilliant achievement of mass movement.

"Rushing forward, ten thousand horses still in battle."

The birth of the hydrogen bomb drove thousands of households, producing a chain reaction. The hydrogen bomb had to explode, and the test project was the first to be affected. The project had to rush for time and speed up the progress, taking two steps at once. Blueprints? Not a single one, wait for others to send the blueprints before starting work? No! No! Absolutely not! In today's fierce class struggle at home and abroad, time is victory. The engineering troops displayed revolutionary initiative, sending people to relevant units to coordinate; if they couldn't get the full set of blueprints at once, they would draw some and get some. Technical personnel emphasized politics, went deep into the construction sites, and cooperated with the engineering troops, designing and constructing simultaneously. They finally arranged the site for the hydrogen bomb explosion.

The activities of various departments at the test site were interlocked, striving for high speed, high standards, and high quality in the test work. There was a research room where the theoretical guidance personnel for the effect were a group of fresh university graduates. How to serve the effect unit well? Chairman Mao's instruction to cooperate greatly opened their minds. They spent the day under the scorching summer sun, walking on the hot sand, going to the effect units, sitting with the masses, exchanging information, and formulating plans. At night, they returned to their tents, savoring the sweetness of cooperation with the masses—what they gave to the masses was theoretical data, and what they learned from the masses was practical data. With practical data as the foundation, formulating plans was indeed accurate and swift. The young theoretical workers thus improved their service level and efficiency.

At the test site, people guarded their posts while keeping the overall situation in mind. Everyone wanted to contribute to the explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb. Exploding the hydrogen bomb put higher demands on meteorological work. The meteorological soldiers understood the weight of this responsibility. For the revolution, they would rather take on a hundred and one than ninety-nine. "Cultivating clouds and rain, ruling the sky," they would satisfy the meteorological requirements of various units, no matter how difficult the exploration of a data point was, no matter how much brainpower and sweat it took, they would always find a way to meet the requirements.

China's hydrogen bomb test also recorded the merits of the protective squad's personnel, who were not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty, and not afraid of death. After the hydrogen bomb exploded, these warriors in protective clothing leaped out of their fortifications like tigers, with the flash as the command, the roar as the charge, and the smoke as the target. They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and rushed towards the explosion center, "Thinking of Zhang Zide, working selflessly; 'completely, thoroughly' in mind, broad-minded and spirited." The protective squad's personnel had only one thought: "In the shortest time and at the fastest speed, get the test results into our hands, paving the way for the rapid development of China's cutting-edge science."

At the test site, serving China's nuclear tests were also those drivers, cooks, doctors, and other logistics personnel. They were respectable nameless heroes, diligent and dedicated practitioners. No matter how much difficulty natural conditions brought to the work, they always found ways to arrange the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the test participants well. The logistics personnel were contributing their strength to China's nuclear weapon tests at their respective posts.

A lofty ideal and a common goal composed a symphony of charging towards the peak of science and technology. This orchestra was a vast army, including the great seven hundred million people of China. A commander said well: "The test is the place where China's cutting-edge science and technology research finally shows results and displays power. The real massive work is outside the site. All military personnel, the national proletarian revolutionary factions, and the broad revolutionary masses have contributed their strength to China's cutting-edge science and technology."

Look! Thousands of precision instruments, mountains of equipment, each piece condensed with the heartblood of the Chinese people. Even a bag of cement, a battery, a piece of wood, or a nail, from the factories and mines that produced them to the test site, all had a long journey, infused with the hard work of thousands of people.

On the nine million six hundred thousand square kilometers of China's land, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for our great leader Chairman Mao, contributed their strength and wisdom to the manufacture and explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb. What a magnificent and grand cooperative action! What a magnificent and grand mass movement!

China's first hydrogen bomb exploded successfully.

A roar shook the world.

Revolutionary people were overjoyed, while the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries were terrified.

The Chinese people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought have no peak they cannot climb.

They can reach the moon in the ninth heaven and catch turtles in the five oceans.

In the field of nuclear weapons, the Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass all countries. China will, with the rolling thunder of spring, let the solemn and beautiful five-star red flag rise higher and higher, reaching the peak of science and technology.

"We are doing what our predecessors have never done, a very glorious and great cause.

Our goal must be achieved.

Our goal will definitely be achieved."

    响彻云霄的毛泽东思想凯歌
    ——记我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早在一九五八年六月就说：“搞一点原子弹、氢弹，我看有十年功夫完全可能。”
    历史的时钟按照我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的英明的伟大的预言敲响了！
    一个震动世界的时刻来到了！
    我国核试验崭新的一页揭开了！
    这是一支响彻云霄的伟大的毛泽东思想的凯歌！
    震动世界的巨响
    旭日东升，霞光万丈，一九六七年六月十七日这个光辉灿烂的早晨，一面庄严鲜艳的五星红旗在我们伟大祖国的西部地区上空高高地升起了！接着，四个红色大气球轻疾地飞向蓝天，气球下飘扬着一幅幅红字标语：
    “伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    “伟大的中国共产党万岁！”
    “无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    试验场区，毛主席语录牌林立，红旗招展，汇成一片红色的海洋。红色的海洋上面高高烘托出我们的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，画像两旁排列着大字标语：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！”“祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”
    我军指战员和工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者以及一切参加试验的人员，在试验前的关键时刻，一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。”“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，抑制着万分激动的心情，按着预定的操作顺序，准确无误地工作着。总控制站人员对各种仪器进行了最后一次检查，对于每一个螺丝，每一个电子元件，每一根导线，每一个焊点，都作了严格的检验，证明设备完全可靠。
    这些安置在现场的仪器，能把试验中的各种数据准确地记录下来。这次试验，不仅以各种各样的仪器、设备测量氢弹爆炸的情况，而且，还安排了大量的试验项目。
    一切准备就绪。总控制站的人员打开控制台，信号在闪动，机器在运转，防护分队战士穿上防护衣，戴上防护面具，参观人员进入了参观台，广播员开始了广播……。
    震动世界的时刻来到了。
    骤然间，闪光万丈，碧蓝天空涌现出一个烈焰翻腾的大火球，只听一声天崩地裂的巨响，火球消失，一个蘑菇形状烟云上升。我国自己设计、自己制造的第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！
    顿时，整个试验场区沸腾了。人们怀着无比喜悦、无比兴奋的革命激情，唱啊，跳啊！含着激动的热泪，挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千遍万遍地高呼：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌。尽情地欢呼吧！纵情地歌唱吧！这响彻云霄的欢天喜地的口号声，朗读语录声和革命歌曲声，交织成一支巨大的胜利凯歌。
    这次氢弹试验，是在我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志深切关怀下进行的。
    这次氢弹试验成功，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在科学战线上的伟大胜利。这个胜利粉碎了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在科学战线上所推行的修正主义路线。
    这次氢弹试验成功，是我军指战员、工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者，积极响应林彪同志的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的伟大成果！是“抓革命，促生产”，自力更生，奋发图强，群策群力，大力协同的成果！
    这次氢弹试验成功，又一次证明，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民最勇敢、最聪明。有了毛泽东思想的精神原子弹，就能造出物质上的原子弹、氢弹，就能创造出任何人间奇迹，就能永远无敌于天下！
    这次氢弹试验成功，是对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义相互勾结妄图实行核垄断、核讹诈的更加沉重的打击。对于正在进行抗美救国战争的英雄的越南人民，对于正在反抗美英帝国主义及其工具以色列侵略的阿拉伯人民，对于全世界的革命人民，都是极大的鼓舞和支持。
    飞跃的步伐
    在全世界革命人民欢呼我们伟大成就的同时，帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，又在那里疯狂地叫嚣，恶毒地咒骂。他们仇恨我们的每一个成就，竭力贬低我们的每一个胜利。
    但是，敌人螳臂挡车，只会自取灭亡。我们不仅不会因敌人的咒骂而放慢自己的脚步，相反，由于伟大的毛泽东思想越来越被广大的革命群众所掌握，我们的国防科学技术更一日千里地向前跃进了。
    一位参加氢弹试验的战士说得好：“只要我们头脑里有了毛泽东思想，什么原子弹、氢弹都能造出来。”
    我国国防科学研究事业的一切胜利，都是在毛主席的关怀和教导下取得的。
    搞一点原子弹、氢弹，我看有十年功夫完全可能。
    这是一九五八年我们伟大的领袖毛主席对国防科学研究事业发出的具有伟大历史意义的号召。
    这个伟大的战斗号召象一声春雷，迅速传到了从事核武器研制和试验工作的我军指战员、工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者以及一切有关人员中去。他们把伟大领袖毛主席的英明指示贴在工作室的墙壁上，记在自己的日记本上，铭刻在自己的心坎上。
    他们说：“毛主席的这个伟大号召，表达了七亿中国人民的愿望，说出了我们的心里话。我们有伟大的毛泽东思想，有伟大领袖毛主席的教导，就没有战胜不了的困难，没有攻不破的科学技术堡垒。”
    他们说：“毛主席的这个伟大号召，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行的奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的右倾机会主义路线是一个狠狠的打击。这些家伙，屈服于帝国主义、修正主义的压力，对我们国防科研事业，不断地吹阴风，泼冷水，大刮下马风，千方百计地限制、取消国防科研事业。我们有了毛主席的伟大号召，就能更好地和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，和各种保守思想作斗争，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    毛主席的伟大号召是战斗的动员令，调动了科研战线上的万马千军，向世界科学的尖端进军。广大群众发挥了无穷无尽的智慧和力量，发扬了高度的勇敢战斗精神，投入了“攻尖战”。
    含有热核材料的原子弹爆炸成功了！
    导弹核武器发射成功了！
    一次又一次的核武器试验成功了！
    我们第五次核试验成功后，在核武器试验快慢的问题上两种思想的斗争更突出了。有的人“怕”字当头，胸无大志，他们看不到广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中迸发出来的革命热情和首创精神，在某些困难面前犹豫徘徊，企图把这次试验推迟。广大的无产阶级革命派和革命群众说：“毛主席号召我们抓革命，促生产，我们还能这样慢腾腾地爬行吗？不能！一万个不能！”
    他们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的指示。他们说：
    “毛主席啊，毛主席！您的话句句闪金光，给我们无限信心和力量，我们无产阶级革命派，对您的话字字照办，句句照办，就是有天大的困难我们也能顶住！”
    他们手捧着宝书，理直气壮地驳斥了这样或那样的错误思想，响亮地提出“提前进行氢弹试验，为无产阶级文化大革命献礼”的口号。
    理论设计的快慢，关系到整个工作的进度。这时，有人说泄气话：“想提前，哪有那么简单。”小将们斩钉截铁地回答：“理论设计，模型设计，什么时候要，我们什么时候赶出来。”小将们昼夜加班，突击制作，提前一个月完成了理论设计。
    要快，先要搬掉前进道路上的拦路虎。当时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大搞经济主义，在工人、技术人员之间制造矛盾，向革命造反派施加种种压力。制弹单位的革命造反派牢记毛主席、党中央的要做“抓革命的先锋，促生产的模范”的号召，挺起腰杆，挑起提前制作氢武器的重担，昂首阔步迎着困难走。
    按照老办法，要等全部设计结束，才能投入施工。革命小将们学习了毛主席关于“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，总结了历次技术定案的经验，打破洋框框、旧框框、死框框，大胆创新；边设计边施工，理论与实验紧密结合，大大加快了速度。我国第一颗氢弹制造，就是按照毛主席的指示胜利完成的。
    制弹工人和技术人员，在争分夺秒地战斗，一切参试人员也同样在争分夺秒地战斗。
    某技术单位为了争取时间，打破历次靠工厂装配仪器的常规，自己装配了所需的仪器，时间比过去快一倍以上。工程部队充分发挥了群众智慧，创造了十多部机械，大大地提高了工作效率，加快了工程进度。某单位有一位技术员，领导上交给他一项要求很高很急的任务。他牢记毛主席的教导，在设计施工中，同工人一起劳动，一起研究，提前完成了这项任务。他们按照林副主席所要求的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性努力去做。快，但是不草率，不马虎，不蛮干，用他们自己的说法，就是一切科学试验都要做到“稳妥可靠，万无一失”。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”
    无数参试人员在争分夺秒地战斗着。
    无数台机器在飞快地旋转着。
    每个部门，各个岗位，每个人“只争朝夕”的革命精神，汇合成一个巨大的成果——我们成功地进行了氢弹试验。
    我国从一九六四年十月成功地爆炸了第一颗原子弹起，到这次成功地进行氢弹试验，只用了两年零八个月的时间。而美国用了七年零四个月，苏联用了四年，英国用了四年零七个月。我们的速度是世界上最快的。
    世界上没有任何力量，能够阻挡伟大的中国人民前进的步伐。
    广阔的道路
    我军一位年青的科学工作者，坚定而自豪地说：“攀登科学技术高峰，尽管曲折艰险，只要我们牢记毛主席的教导，自力更生，奋发图强，就能闯出自己的一条路来。我们的原子弹、氢弹试验成功，就是最有力的证明。”这位年青的科学工作者，说出了大家要说的话。自力更生，奋发图强，这是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的字眼，它蕴藏着强大的精神威力和无比旺盛的创造力。
    毛主席说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”又说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”我军指战员、广大职工、工程技术人员、科学工作者，按照毛主席的这一伟大指示，树雄心，立壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，从“零”开始，白手创业。我们每前进一步要付出多么巨大的劳动啊！进行多么艰苦的斗争啊！我们要和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在科技战线所推行的修正主义路线作斗争；我们还要和美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和一切反动派的封锁、阻挠、破坏作斗争。科学技术人员和工人们憋着一口气，按照毛主席自力更生、奋发图强的指示，采取科学技术人员、工人、领导“三结合”的方法，自己动手，敢想敢干。
    是的，中国人民有志气有能力，一定要在不远的将来赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    我们不但有了自己的原子弹，有了自己的导弹，而且只用短短的两年零八个月的时间成功地爆炸了自己的氢弹。
    我们自己设计、制造的氢弹是完全成功的。
    为了成功地完成这次大规模的尖端科学的试验任务，我军指战员、工人、工程技术人员和科学工作者，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，制造了大批的仪器和设备。这里特别要提到的是，担负全场自动控制系统任务的、被称为试验场区的“神经中枢”单位的年青的科学技术人员和工人，自己设计、制造、安装、调试的新的先进的自动控制设备的动人事迹。几个月来，他们一边控诉、批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的滔天罪行，一边进行设计研究、试验和试制。干啊！干啊！废寝忘食，度过了多少不眠之夜啊！
    在试制的实践过程中，他们按照毛主席的教导，运用辩证唯物论的观点，每实践一步，就总结一次，提高一步。他们坚信认识来源于实践，实践是检查真理的唯一标准，大胆地进行了多次反复的试验，终于获得了成功。
    这次氢弹试验中，这一套新的先进的自动控制设备，在氢弹爆炸的一瞬间，带动几千台测试仪器，分秒不差地按着预定的计划动作；它把全场区各个战线联结成一个有机的整体，达到“稳妥可靠，万无一失”的要求，成功地发挥了“神经中枢”的作用。
    当领导和群众称赞他们的技术过得硬时，他们说：“人听毛主席的话，机器就听人的话。毛主席著作给我们指示了方向，带来了智慧，增添了无穷的力量。”
    集体的创作
    群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，群众是科学技术的主人。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席指示：要大力协同，做好这件工作。我国氢弹爆炸的成功，正是大力协同集体创作的光辉成果，群众运动的光辉成果。
    “奔腾急，万马战犹酣。”
    氢弹的出世带动了千门万户，产生了连锁反应。氢弹要爆炸，试验工程首当其冲。工程要抢时间、赶进度，两步并作一步走。图纸呢？一张没有，等别人把图纸送到手里再开工吗？不行！不行！万万不行！在国内国外阶级斗争激烈进行的今天，时间就是胜利。工程兵指战员，发挥了革命的主动精神，派人到有关单位联系；一时取不到全套图纸，那就绘一批取一批。技术人员突出政治，深入工地和工程兵协同作战，边设计边施工，他们终于为氢弹的爆炸安排好了场地。
    试验场各部门的活动环环相扣，力争试验工作的高速度、高标准、高质量。有一个研究室，效应物的理论指导工作人员，是一伙刚毕业的大学生。怎样为效应单位服好务呢？毛主席要大力协同的指示，使得这伙年青人开了脑筋。他们白天头顶盛夏的骄阳，脚踏滚烫的沙滩，到效应的单位去，同群众一起促膝谈心，交流情况，制定方案。晚上，他们回到帐篷里，回味着和群众协同配合的甜头——送给群众的是理论数据，从群众那里学来的是实践数据，有了实践数据作基础，制定起方案来，真是又准确又迅速。年青的理论工作者，就这样提高了自己的服务水平和效率。
    在试验场地，人们各守岗位，而又胸怀全局。人人都想为我国第一颗氢弹的爆炸多出一分力。爆炸氢弹，对气象工作提出了更高的要求。气象战士懂得这份担子的重量。为了革命，他们宁挑一百一，不挑九十九。“耕云播雨管老天，万里长空我当家。”对于各单位提出的气象要求，不管难度多大，也不管探索一个数据用多少脑子，流多少汗水，他们总是千方百计地给予满足。
    我国氢弹试验成功，也记载了防护分队的指战员的功绩，他们不怕苦，不怕难，不怕死。在氢弹爆炸之后，这些身穿防护衣的勇士，猛虎般地跃出工事，闪光是命令，巨响是冲锋号，烟云是目标，他们喊着“毛主席万岁！”扑向爆炸的中心，“想到张思德，工作起来全忘我；‘完全、彻底’心里装，心界开阔斗志昂。”防护分队的指战员们，一不为名二不为利，只有一个念头：“在最短的时间，以最快的速度，把试验成果拿到手，为我国尖端科学的飞速发展架桥铺路。”
    在试验场上，为我国核试验服务的，还有那些汽车司机、炊事员、医生等后勤工作人员，他们都是可敬的无名英雄，勤勤恳恳、任劳任怨的实干家。无论自然条件给工作带来多大困难，他们总是想方设法，把参试人员的衣食住行安排得很好。后勤人员正是在各自的岗位上，为我国核武器试验，贡献出自己的力量。
    崇高的理想，共同的目的，谱成了向科学技术高峰冲击的交响曲。这支乐队是一支浩浩荡荡的大军，包括了我国伟大的七亿人民。有一位指挥员说得好：“试验是我国尖端科学技术研究最后显示成果、检阅威力的地方，真正大量的工作是在场外。全体指战员，全国无产阶级革命派，广大革命群众，都为我国尖端科学技术贡献了自己的力量。”
    请看！千台万部精密仪器，堆积如山的装备器材，件件凝结着全国人民的心血。即便是一袋水泥、一节电池、一根木料，以至一颗铁钉，从生产它们的厂矿车间来到试验场内，都有一段长途跋涉的里程，灌注着千百万人的辛勤劳动。
    在我国九百六十万平方公里的土地上，无产阶级革命派和革命群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的感情，为我国第一颗氢弹的制造和爆炸，努力贡献自己的力量和智慧，这是何等宏伟壮阔的协同动作，这是何等宏伟壮阔的群众运动啊！
    我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了。
    一声巨响，举世震动。
    革命人民欢欣鼓舞，帝、修、反惊恐万状。
    毛泽东思想哺育的中国人民没有不可攀登的高峰。
    可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖。
    在核武器方面，我国人民有志气有能力赶上一切国家，超过一切国家，我国将伴着春雷滚滚的巨响，让庄严美丽的五星红旗高升高升再高升，直升上科学技术的最高峰。
    “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。”
