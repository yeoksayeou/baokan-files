According to a Xinhua News Agency report, under the guidance of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Soviet stage is overrun with poisonous weeds, and a host of demons and monsters have emerged.

For many years, whether it was Khrushchev or his successors, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, they have spared no effort in using the stage to corrupt the Soviet people and the younger generation. Under the reactionary cultural policy of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Soviet stage has become a world of smoke and stench.

To numb the revolutionary will of the people, plays that promote the decadent lifestyle of the high-salaried class in the Soviet Union and spread the poison of bourgeois individualism are being performed on the Soviet stage. The Soviet Cultural News acknowledged that "figures of doubt, wavering, self-reflection, and 'wise' pessimists who are essentially calculating petty bourgeois" are rampant on the Soviet stage. Another article in the same newspaper revealed that plays with content such as "ferocity, evil, curiosity about others' pain, lack of genuine emotion, lewdness..." are being performed on the Soviet stage. This type of play is widely performed in the Soviet Union and has a broad impact. For example, a play titled "One Hundred and Four Pages of Love," which primarily promotes the bourgeois individualist view of life of enjoying the moment, was performed simultaneously in Moscow and Leningrad as soon as it was released. In Dnipropetrovsk, four touring theaters performed this play in one season.

"Following" the purpose and tasks of the Soviet revisionist clique to spread war terror and peddle the philosophy of survival, the Soviet stage has performed a large number of plays filled with pacifist poison. According to the Soviet Cultural News, Simonov's novel "The Living and the Dead," which defames the Soviet people's anti-Fascist war and defames Soviet soldiers, was further strengthened in its war terror content when adapted for the stage, "focusing on the physical and mental suffering of the people in the war."

On the Soviet stage, there have also appeared a large number of plays that target the dictatorship of the proletariat, supposedly against "Stalin's personality cult." The New York Times, in commenting on a play that was once popular in the Soviet Union, "A Man's Life," especially applauded the play's content attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, saying that the play "through the experience of a person from the Stalin era, frankly discussed the dark side of Russia."

In 1964, the Soviet revisionist leaders publicly declared at an "ideological" meeting that the "most important task" of the Soviet literary and artistic circle was to "conduct irreconcilable struggle" with the "concepts" of "Chinese splitters," openly calling for revisionist writers to launch a fierce anti-China campaign. Since then, a batch of vicious anti-China plays have begun to emerge.

Following the "purpose and tasks" of the Soviet revisionist leadership to restore capitalism, they have not hesitated to bring back onto the stage plays that had been criticized and banned during the period when Stalin led the Soviet Union. These include the play "The Blizzard," which was criticized soon after its release in the 1940s and fiercely attacked the rectification campaigns, and Shostakovich's yellow opera "Katerina Izmailova," which was criticized and banned in the 1930s. They stage ghost plays, bringing onto the stage figures like the "disheveled" Grim Reaper and "clever and seductive" demons.

The Soviet revisionist clique believes that relying solely on domestic plays is not enough to achieve their "purpose and tasks." They also performed a large number of plays by Western bourgeois writers and greatly praised and promoted them. According to the Soviet Pravda, "the majority of the plays on the (Soviet) theater program are by foreign writers," and these plays "promote the lifestyle of bourgeois society." The Soviet leaders use the stage to spread poison, thinking they are successful, but this exposes their traitorous nature to the broad masses of the Soviet people.

    宣扬西方生活方式麻痹人民革命意志攻击无产阶级专政
    苏修舞台乌烟瘴气牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼
    据新华社讯　在苏修领导集团的倡导下，苏联戏剧舞台上，毒草丛生，牛鬼蛇神大批出笼。
    多年来，不论是赫鲁晓夫还是他的继承者勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团，都不遗余力地利用戏剧舞台来腐蚀苏联人民和青年一代。在苏修领导集团反动的文化方针指导下，苏联舞台成了一片乌烟瘴气的世界。
    为了麻痹人民革命意志，宣扬苏修国内高薪阶层的老爷太太少爷小姐们的颓废生活方式和散布资产阶级个人主义毒素的戏剧，在苏联舞台上纷纷上演。《苏维埃文化报》的一篇文章承认，“怀疑、动摇、反省型的失败者和‘由于饱经世故而练达’的悲观主义者——从实质上讲是动脑筋的市侩”的形象，充斥苏联舞台。这家报纸的另一篇文章中透露，苏联舞台上演出了这样一些内容的戏剧：“凶狠、邪恶、对别人的痛苦感到好奇、缺乏诚挚的感情、淫荡……”。这类戏剧在苏联大量上演，流毒极广。例如，一出以宣扬及时行乐等等资产阶级个人主义人生观为主要内容的话剧《一百零四页爱情》，刚一抛出，就同时在莫斯科和列宁格勒上演。在德聂伯尔彼得罗夫斯克，在一个演出季中，就有四个巡回演出剧院先后去演这出戏。
    “遵循”苏修集团散布战争恐怖、兜售活命哲学的“目的和任务”，苏联舞台上演出了大量充满和平主义毒素的戏剧。据《苏维埃文化报》报道，西蒙诺夫一部丑化苏联人民反法西斯战争、丑化苏军战士的小说《生者与死者》，在被搬上舞台时，进一步加强了战争恐怖内容，“把重点放在人民战争中遭到的肉体痛苦和精神痛苦上。”
    在苏联舞台上还出现了大量矛头指向无产阶级专政的所谓反“斯大林个人迷信”的戏剧。《纽约时报》在评论曾在苏联风行一时的话剧《人活着》时，特别为这出戏攻击无产阶级专政的内容喝采，说什么这出戏“通过一个斯大林时代的人的经历，直言无讳地谈到了俄国的阴暗面。”
    一九六四年，苏修集团头目在一次“意识形态”会议上还公然叫嚷，苏联文艺界“最重要的任务”是同“中国分裂主义者”的“概念”“进行不调和的斗争”，公开号召修正主义文人大肆反华。自此以后，一批恶毒反华的剧目开始出笼。
    苏修戏剧界“遵循”苏修领导集团复辟资本主义的“目的和任务”，不惜把那些早已被苏联人民唾弃的、在斯大林领导苏联时期被禁演的戏剧，重新搬上舞台。其中包括四十年代刚一出笼即被批判、猖狂攻击肃反的话剧《暴风雪》，三十年代受到批判和被禁演的肖斯塔科维奇的黄色歌剧《卡捷琳娜·伊兹玛洛娃》等等。他们大演鬼戏，把什么“披头散发”型的死神、“巧妙的和媚惑的”恶鬼等等搬上了舞台。
    苏修集团认为，仅仅靠本国创作的戏剧，还不足以完成自己的“目的和任务”，他们还上演了大量的西方资产阶级作家的剧本，并且大加吹捧宣扬。据苏联《真理报》承认，“在（苏联）剧院的节目单上，绝大多数是外国作家的剧本”，这些剧本“宣扬的是资产阶级社会的生活方式”。苏修头目利用戏剧舞台大肆放毒，自以为得意，但这却使苏联广大群众日益识破他们叛徒的真面目。
