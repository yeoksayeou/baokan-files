In the midst of the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary herdsmen of various ethnic groups in Qinghai have welcomed the peak season for the birth of large livestock. This year, the production of large livestock on the Qinghai grasslands is a bumper year. By the end of May, the province had already produced 55,700 foals, calves, and camel colts, with a survival rate of 97%.

In the unprecedented Cultural Revolution, the herdsmen of various ethnic groups in Qinghai, through the exposure and criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, have launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of herdsmen study the "Three Articles" as their "guiding principles," breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," further promoting the revolutionization of thought. In the peak season of large livestock production, while firmly grasping the revolution, they work selflessly in various pastures, carefully grazing the mother animals and meticulously raising the young animals. Many herdsmen have expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" and to strive for a bumper harvest in large livestock production.

Shangcheng County Achieves Bumper Harvest of Wheat

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shangcheng County, Henan Province, have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production." This year, 560,000 mu of wheat have been harvested. Currently, the wheat in the entire county has been harvested. From the actual yields of some production teams, it can be seen that this year's wheat yield has increased by about 20% compared to last year's highest yield.

When sowing wheat last year, Shangcheng County had not seen a heavy rain for half a year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," overcoming the difficulties brought by severe drought and sowing wheat on time.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this county are, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," rushing to sow late-season crops while strengthening the field management of early-season crops, continuing to strive for an even greater bumper harvest in the autumn.

Guiyang County's Tobacco Planting Progresses Rapidly with High Quality

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Guiding County, a famous tobacco-producing area in Guizhou Province, have grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production. This year, the progress of tobacco planting is rapid and the quality is high. By June 6, the county had already transplanted 22,000 mu of early tobacco, accounting for 73% of the tobacco planting plan. The communes of Dexin, Dingnan, and Gusa have already completed their tobacco planting tasks ahead of schedule.

Planting more early tobacco is the key to ensuring high-quality and high-yield tobacco leaves. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with class hatred towards the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, have used revolution to lead production, overcoming various difficulties, and completing the tobacco planting plan with high quality. According to inspections from various places, the tobacco fields have all been deeply plowed or deeply dug, with deep ridge planting, and more than 2,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. After transplanting, a clear manure water was promptly applied, and the survival rate of the transplanted tobacco seedlings is high.

    去年种麦时，襄城县已经有半年没有下过透雨。广大贫下中农和革命干部遵循毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，战胜了严重干旱带来的困难，适时种上了小麦。
