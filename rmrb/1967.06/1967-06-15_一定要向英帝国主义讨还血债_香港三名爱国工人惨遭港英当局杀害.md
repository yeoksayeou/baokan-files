It has now been confirmed that in the series of bloody suppressions carried out by the British authorities in Hong Kong against our Hong Kong compatriots, at least three patriotic workers have been brutally murdered by the British authorities. This bloody crime committed by the British fascist thugs has aroused the indignation of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, who unanimously shout in anger: "Blood for blood! We absolutely cannot tolerate British imperialism bullying us like this! We must give the crazy enemy a merciless blow!"

The three patriotic workers who were murdered are: Xu Tianbo, a worker in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Department of the British "Public Works Department"; Li Song, a worker at the Hong Kong Chinese Gas Company; and Chen Guangsheng, a young apprentice in a barbershop.

Li Song's body was discovered on the 11th. During the "June 8" massacre by British fascist thugs at the Chinese Gas Company, gas worker Li Song put up a resolute struggle against the British fascist thugs and subsequently went missing. It was not until the morning of the 11th that workers at the gas plant discovered Li Song's body at the outlet of the coal hopper. According to the gas workers, after killing Li Song, the British authorities inhumanely threw his body into the coal hopper of the gas plant, covering it with coal in an attempt to destroy the body and eliminate evidence by sending Li Song along with the coal into a gasifier with temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees. After the gas plant workers discovered Li Song's body, they exposed the British authorities' evil plot. On the same day, the British authorities quickly dispatched several British police officers to the scene, directing their subordinates to secretly remove the body away from the crowd, appearing very nervous and panicked. Li Song's family members rushed to identify the body upon hearing the news and found that the deceased's tongue was protruding, the forehead bone was fractured, the skin was peeling off, and the left eyeball had burst.

Hong Kong workers also exposed the situation in which the British authorities murdered the worker Xu Tianbo from the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Department. In the afternoon of the 9th, the British authorities sent a hearse to the Wong Tai Sin Police Station. The driver of the car was a patriotic worker who had previously known Xu Tianbo. When the body was brought out, he immediately recognized it as Xu Tianbo's corpse. At that time, the deceased's entire body was bruised and covered with mud.

Another young victim named Chen Guangsheng was 13 years old and an apprentice in a barbershop. On the evening of May 12, he was beaten in the head by British thugs in the Wong Tai Sin resettlement area in Kowloon and died in the hospital on the morning of the 13th.

In addition, according to reports from Hong Kong newspapers, after the "June 8" massacre, it was also discovered that gas worker Zeng Ming had gone missing.

The atrocities of the British authorities have sparked deep hatred among Hong Kong compatriots. Patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the families of the victims expressed their indignation, vowing to demand blood debt from the British authorities.

    一定要向英帝国主义讨还血债
    香港三名爱国工人惨遭港英当局杀害
    据新华社香港十四日电　现已证实，在港英当局对我香港同胞进行的一连串血腥镇压中，至少已有三名爱国工人惨遭港英当局杀害。港英法西斯暴徒的这一血腥罪行，激起了我香港爱国同胞的同仇敌忾，人们愤怒地齐声高呼：“血债血偿！”“绝不能容忍英帝国主义这样欺负我们！一定要给疯狂的敌人以无情的痛击！”
    被杀害的三名爱国工人是：港英“工务局”电器机械工程部工人徐田波，香港中华煤气有限公司工人黎松，理发店少年学徒工陈广生。
    黎松的尸体是在十一日发现的。港英法西斯暴徒“六·八”血洗中华煤气有限公司时，煤气工人黎松同港英法西斯暴徒进行了坚决的斗争，事后黎松即告失踪。直到十一日上午，煤气厂工人才在煤斗的出口处发现黎松的尸体。据煤气工人揭露，港英当局杀害黎松后，竟灭绝人性地把他的尸体丢进煤气厂的煤斗内，用煤盖住，阴谋把黎松连同煤块一起送进温度高达一千度以上的化气炉毁尸灭迹。煤气厂工人发现黎松的尸体后，揭露了港英当局的罪恶阴谋。当天，港英当局连忙派出英籍警官多人到现场，指挥手下鹰犬躲着群众鬼鬼祟祟地把尸体运走，显得十分紧张、惊慌。黎松的家属闻讯后立即赶去认尸，发现死者舌头突出，额骨破裂，皮肤脱落，左眼珠已经爆裂。
    香港工人还揭露了港英当局杀害电器机械工程部工人徐田波的情况。九日下午四时，港英当局派了一辆运尸车去黄大仙警署，开车的司机是一个爱国工人，过去认识徐田波。尸体运出来时，他立即认出是徐田波的遗体，当时只见死者全身淤黑，沾满泥沙。
    另一名被杀害的少年名叫陈广生，今年十三岁，是一家理发店的学徒工，他于五月十二日晚上在九龙黄大仙徙置区内被港英暴徒打伤头部，十三日晨在医院里不治惨死。
    此外，据香港报纸报道，“六·八”血案后，还发现煤气工人曾明失踪。
    港英当局的暴行，引起香港同胞的切齿痛恨。香港爱国同胞和死难者的家属悲愤地表示，一定要向港英讨还血债。
