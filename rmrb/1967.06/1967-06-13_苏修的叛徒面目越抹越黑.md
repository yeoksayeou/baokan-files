The Soviet revisionist leadership, in an attempt to cover up their treacherous actions against the Arab people, rallied the Tito revisionist clique and others to issue a joint statement on the Middle East situation on June 9. They tried to use a worthless piece of paper pretending to support the Arab people as a fig leaf to once again deceive the Arab people. However, this clumsy trick by the Soviet revisionist clique only further exposed their shameless hypocrisy of pretending to support while actually betraying the Arab people.

Everyone knows that U.S. imperialism is the mastermind behind Israel's aggression. It not only instigated, supported, and directed Israel's surprise attack on Arab countries but also directly deployed its air force to participate in Israel's aggression. However, the Soviet revisionists' so-called "joint statement" did not condemn U.S. imperialism even once. Apart from indicating that the Soviet revisionists intend to exonerate U.S. imperialism and continue to "cooperate" with it, what other explanation can there be?

The Soviet revisionists' "joint statement" hypocritically claims that they "fully support" the just struggle of Arab countries and will "make every necessary effort to help the Arab people resolutely repel the aggressors." Such worthless rhetoric only makes one nauseous!

In your statement on May 23, you pretended to say that those who "initiated the aggression" would face "resolute anti-aggression actions" from the Soviet Union. But after Israel launched its aggression, what "actions" did you actually take? You stood idly by as Israel attacked Arab countries. Your actions were clear: in the United Nations, you collaborated with U.S. imperialism to shield Israel and pressure Arab countries; in Moscow, you protected the U.S. and British embassies and obstructed protests by Arab and Asian-African students. These actions of yours, are they not actions of conniving and supporting U.S. imperialism and Israel's aggression, rather than "anti-aggression actions"? You have done nothing but betray the Arab people in the most despicable ways, yet you shamelessly boast about being "faithful to your internationalist duties." Isn't your face too thick?

Even more laughable is that after issuing the "joint statement," the Soviet revisionists solemnly announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Israel. When Israel threatened war against Arab countries, you did not sever ties. After Israel launched a surprise attack on Arab countries, you still did not sever ties. Instead, you have been secretly colluding with this running dog of U.S. imperialism. Now, you think you can use this trick to appease the Arab people's anger? How can that be possible? Moreover, your reason for severing ties with Israel is not because Israel invaded Arab countries, but because Israel "ignored" the so-called "Security Council resolution" that you and U.S. imperialism jointly concocted. This only shows that what you are trying to protect is not the interests of Arab countries, but rather, you are protecting the United Nations, which you and U.S. imperialism jointly manipulate. You intend to use this tool to force Arab countries to submit. No wonder the Israeli aggressors "laughed off" your "severance of ties."

The Soviet revisionists collude with U.S. imperialism and betray the Arab people, adding another debt to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. You are a bunch of old traitors. For many years, wherever there is a revolution, wherever there is an anti-aggression struggle, you engage in treacherous activities there, acting as henchmen for U.S. imperialism.

You repeatedly voted in the Security Council to support U.S. imperialism's use of the "UN forces" to suppress the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese people.

You knuckled under to U.S. imperialism's war threats, openly betraying the Cuban people.

You supported U.S. imperialism's use of the United Nations to interfere in Cyprus' internal affairs.

In the struggle against Indian aggressors, you sided with the Indian reactionaries, forcing Pakistan to accept a "ceasefire" favorable to India.

When U.S. imperialism used armed force to suppress the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Dominican people, you supported U.S. imperialism's further interference through the United Nations.

In the Vietnam issue, you worked tirelessly to serve U.S. imperialism's plot of "using war to force peace" and "bombing to force negotiations," attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

All these treacherous acts, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will surely settle accounts with you one day. No matter how many tricks you play, you will never escape historical punishment.

The treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionists have aroused the great indignation of the Arab people. They shouted slogans such as "Down with Kosygin!" and "Soviet Union out of the Middle East!" during their demonstrations. The Arab people now see that the Soviet revisionists are false friends with honeyed words and poisonous hearts, and faithful henchmen of the Anglo-American imperialists.

Chairman Mao said, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for revolution." In this anti-aggression war, the Arab people have further distinguished between friends and enemies. They will surely rely on their own strength, unite with true friends, and carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its henchmen to the end, achieving a thorough victory.

    苏修的叛徒面目越抹越黑
    本报评论员
    苏修领导集团为了掩饰自己出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒行径，纠集铁托叛徒集团等一伙，在六月九日发表了一个七国关于中东局势的“联合声明”，妄图用假装支持阿拉伯人民的一纸空文作为遮羞布，再一次欺骗阿拉伯人民。但是，苏修集团这出拙劣的把戏，却更加暴露了他们对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的无耻嘴脸。
    谁都知道，美帝国主义是指使以色列发动侵略战争的罪魁祸首。它不仅策动、支持、指挥以色列对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击，而且直接出动空军参预了以色列的侵略行动。但是，苏修集团的所谓“联合声明”却一如既往，根本没有用一个字谴责美帝国主义。这除了说明苏修集团力图替美帝国主义开脱罪责，并且打算继续同美帝国主义进行“合作”以外，还能作什么别的解释呢？
    苏修集团的“联合声明”虚情假意地说什么他们“完全支持”阿拉伯国家的正义斗争，并“将作出一切必要的努力来帮助阿拉伯人民坚决击退侵略者”。这种一文不值的废话只能使人作呕！
    你们在五月二十三日的声明里，不是就装模作样地说过什么“发动侵略的人”会受到苏联的“坚决的反侵略行动”吗？可是在以色列发动侵略以后，你们究竟采取了什么“行动”呢？你们对以色列进攻阿拉伯国家完全袖手旁观。你们的行动是有的，那就是在联合国里同美帝国主义通力合作，庇护以色列，对阿拉伯国家施加压力；那就是在莫斯科替美英大使馆保驾，阻挠阿拉伯和亚非拉留学生的抗议示威。你们的这些行动，难道不是纵容和支持美帝国主义和以色列侵略的行动，而是什么“反侵略行动”吗？你们干尽了出卖阿拉伯人民的卑鄙勾当，居然毫不脸红地大肆吹嘘什么“忠于自己的国际主义义务”。你们的脸皮不是太厚了吗？
    尤其可笑的是，苏修集团在发表“联合声明”以后，又煞有介事地宣布同以色列断绝外交关系。在以色列对阿拉伯国家进行战争威胁的时候，你们不同它断交。在以色列对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击以后，你们也不同它断交。相反的，你们一直同美帝国主义的这条走狗眉来眼去，暗中勾搭。现在，你们想用这样一手花招来平息阿拉伯人民对你们的愤慨，这又怎么能办得到呢？况且你们宣布同以色列断交的理由，并不是因为以色列侵略了阿拉伯国家，而是因为以色列“无视”你们同美帝国主义合伙炮制的所谓“安理会决议”。这只能表明你们所要维护的，根本不是阿拉伯国家的利益，而是恰恰相反，你们要维护的是你们同美帝国主义共同操纵的工具联合国。你们企图利用这个工具来迫使阿拉伯国家就范。难怪以色列侵略者对你们的“断交”决定“一笑置之”了。
    苏修集团勾结美帝国主义、出卖阿拉伯人民，对亚非拉人民欠下了又一笔新债。你们是一帮老叛徒了。多年来，哪里有革命，哪里有反侵略斗争，你们就在哪里进行叛卖活动，给美帝国主义充当帮凶。
    你们在安理会一再投票支持美帝国主义利用“联合国军”镇压刚果（金）人民的革命斗争。
    你们在美帝国主义的战争威胁面前屈膝投降，公开出卖古巴人民。
    你们支持美帝国主义利用联合国干涉塞浦路斯内部事务。
    你们在巴基斯坦反击印度侵略者的斗争中，偏袒印度反动派，强迫巴基斯坦接受有利于印度的“停火”。
    你们在美帝国主义武装镇压多米尼加人民反美爱国斗争的时候，支持美帝国主义利用联合国进一步进行干涉。
    你们在越南问题上竭力为美帝国主义“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋奔走效劳，企图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。
    你们这一切叛卖行为，亚非拉人民迟早总要同你们算账的。不管你们玩弄多少花招，你们也绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。
    苏修集团的叛卖行径，已激起了阿拉伯人民的极大愤慨。他们在示威游行中纷纷高呼“打倒柯西金！”“苏联滚出中东去！”的口号。阿拉伯人民现在看清楚了苏修集团是口蜜腹剑的假朋友，美英帝国主义的忠实帮凶。
    毛主席说，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”阿拉伯人民在这次反侵略战争中进一步分清了敌友，他们一定能够依靠自己的力量，团结真正的朋友，把反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争进行到底，取得彻底的胜利。
