Chairman Mao recently instructed us that the current Cultural Revolution is only the first one, and there will necessarily be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, the restoration of capitalism could happen at any time. All Party members and the people of the entire nation should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will ensure eternal peace. We must always be vigilant and never let our guard down.

This is a great strategic thought.

Under the new situation of the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat, it is of particular and great practical significance to deeply understand and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great strategic thought.

The proletarian revolution is the greatest and most thorough revolution in human history. The bourgeoisie seizing power means the end of the revolution. But the proletariat seizing power is "only the first step in a journey of ten thousand miles."

Proletarian dictatorship is not the end of class struggle but the continuation of class struggle under new conditions. The proletariat must, over a long period, continuously strengthen its dictatorship, continue to hold high the banner of revolution, thoroughly criticize the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left by the exploiting classes, thoroughly reform all superstructures that do not correspond to the socialist economic base, and always be on guard against the restoration of capitalism. To achieve this goal, we must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, with the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, carry out many major and minor battles of the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat.

To carry the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat to the end, the most important and fundamental thing is to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, aiming at the main target of the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship—the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The contradiction between this handful of people and the broad revolutionary masses is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. The current criticism and struggle by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is aimed at resolving this principal contradiction.

The bourgeoisie and their representatives will never willingly accept their own demise and will never voluntarily leave the historical stage. At the critical moment of the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat entering the struggle for power, they will always play various tricks, attempting to shake our proletarian headquarters from the right and the ultra-"left," opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and diverting our direction of struggle. Various anarchist, factionalist, cliquist, and individualist bourgeois ideologies within our revolutionary ranks can often be utilized by class enemies to weaken and even sabotage proletarian dictatorship. Those with serious non-proletarian thoughts always quarrel over personal and petty interests, forgetting the real enemy, and directing the spearhead of struggle at their own allies or even comrades-in-arms. In this way, they may commit errors in direction and line.

We must see that the ideas, concepts, habits, and traditions of the exploiting classes are extremely stubborn and will not easily withdraw from the historical stage. The struggle of the proletariat against them will never be a one-time solution. At the same time, we should see that throughout the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship, the petty bourgeoisie will constantly, every day and every moment, spontaneously and in large numbers, produce capitalists and new bourgeois elements, threatening proletarian dictatorship. The wavering nature of the petty bourgeoisie seriously exists. This wavering nature can often be utilized to create favorable conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

Lenin profoundly pointed out: "Some people, like small proprietors, view the victory over the capitalists, saying: 'The capitalists have had their turn, now it's my turn.' Clearly, each of them is the source of the emergence of a new generation of bourgeois."

In a socialist society, the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie spontaneously surround the proletariat from all sides, infiltrate the proletariat, and corrupt the proletariat, seeking their agents within the proletarian revolutionary ranks. At the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao warned us that we must be on guard against attacks by sugar-coated bullets. Over the past seventeen years, the vast majority of people have withstood this test, but a few have been hit by the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and have degenerated into representatives of the bourgeoisie. This is a serious historical lesson. If we proletarian revolutionaries forget this serious historical lesson and lack the long-term class struggle mindset and determination for self-reform, we may waver at the critical moment of class struggle and become captives of the bourgeois worldview centered on the individual.

In the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat, some people, when oppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line, can stand up and revolt, becoming pioneers. However, when their positions change and external pressures lessen, especially when they hold a portion of power, the non-proletarian thoughts in their minds surface. They feel superior and look down on the masses and those comrades-in-arms who have shared hardships with them. They think they have revolutionized to the core and thus stop, not advancing further, which is extremely dangerous. If such people do not remain vigilant, they may become, as Lu Xun said, those who were once "pulling the cart forward" but later became those "pulling the cart backward."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Anything reactionary that you do not attack will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; where the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear on its own." Digging out the representatives of the bourgeoisie does not mean eliminating their influence; digging out the old representatives of the bourgeoisie will produce new representatives of the bourgeoisie. We must deeply understand this law of class struggle and not forget class struggle.

The proletarian revolutionaries must bravely take up the revolutionary broom, thoroughly sweep away the remnants of capitalism and revisionism in all fields, and in this great revolutionary struggle, deeply touch their souls, reform their souls, and thoroughly smash the kingdoms of bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie within their souls. If we do not do this, some people in our ranks may, under the infiltration of bourgeois and petty bourgeois thoughts, gradually "peacefully evolve" and slide onto the path of revisionism, and may even become new representatives of the bourgeoisie, following the dialectical law of history, turning to their opposite.

We should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and constantly revolutionize, always marching forward.

    不断革命，永远前进
    任立新
    毛主席最近教导我们说，现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了，千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
    这是一个伟大的战略思想。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，深刻领会和坚决贯彻毛主席的这个伟大的战略思想，具有特别重大的现实意义。
    无产阶级革命是人类历史上最伟大、也是最彻底的革命。资产阶级取得政权，意味着革命的结束。而无产阶级取得政权，则“只是万里长征走完了第一步”。
    无产阶级专政不是阶级斗争的结束，而是阶级斗争在新形势下的继续。无产阶级必须在长时期内不断强化自己的专政，继续高举革命的旗帜，彻底批判剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，彻底改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，随时防止资本主义复辟。而要达到这个目的，就必须按照毛主席的教导，以不断革命和彻底革命的精神，进行无产阶级文化大革命的许多次大战役和小战役。
    要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，最重要、最根本的是要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把目标对准无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这一小撮人和广大革命人民的矛盾是主要矛盾，是对抗性矛盾。当前亿万革命群众对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行的大批判、大斗争，就是为了解决这个主要的矛盾。
    资产阶级和他们的代表人物，决不会甘心自己的死亡，决不会自行退出历史舞台。在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，他们总是要玩弄各种阴谋，妄图从右的方面和极“左”的方面来动摇我们的无产阶级司令部，对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，转移我们的斗争大方向。而我们革命队伍中形形色色的无政府主义，小团体主义，宗派主义，个人主义等资产阶级思潮，就往往有可能被阶级敌人所利用，削弱甚至破坏无产阶级专政。非无产阶级思想严重的人，他们斤斤计较的是个人和小山头的利益，而忘记了真正的敌人，把斗争的矛头指向自己的同盟者甚至战友。这样，他们就有可能犯方向和路线的错误。
    必须看到，剥削阶级和他们的思想、观念、习惯、传统是异常顽固的，它们决不会轻易地退出历史舞台。无产阶级同他们的斗争，决不可能一劳永逸。同时还应该看到，在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期内，小资产阶级还会经常不断地、每日每时地、自发地和大批地生长出资本主义和新的资产阶级分子，威胁着无产阶级专政。小资产阶级的动摇性严重地存在着。而这种动摇性，往往会被利用来为资本主义复辟制造便利。
    列宁深刻地指出：“有些人象小私有者一样看待对资本家的胜利，他们说：‘资本家已经捞了一把，现在该轮到我了。’可见他们每一个人都是产生新的一代资产者的根源。”
    在社会主义社会中，资产阶级和小资产阶级自发势力从各方面包围着无产阶级，浸染着无产阶级，腐蚀着无产阶级，在无产阶级革命队伍内部寻找它们的代理人。毛主席在党的七届二中全会上就告诫我们，必须警惕人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击。十七年来，绝大多数人经受住了这种考验，但是也有少数人被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹击中了，堕落成资产阶级代表人物。这是严重的历史教训。我们无产阶级革命派如果忘记了这个严重的历史教训，如果缺乏长期的阶级斗争的思想准备和自我改造的决心，就有可能在阶级斗争的关键时刻发生动摇，成为以个人为轴心的资产阶级世界观的俘虏。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，有些人在受资产阶级反动路线压迫时，也能够站出来革命，当闯将。但是，当他们所处的地位发生了改变，外界压力小了，特别是当他们掌握了一部分权力的时候，他们头脑中的非无产阶级思想就发作起来了。他们觉得自己高人一等，也就看不起群众，看不起那些和自己共过患难的战友。他们以为自己革命到了底，于是就停顿下来，不再前进，这是异常危险的。这种人如果再不警惕，他们就可能成为鲁迅所说的，曾经是“拉车前进的”，可是后来却变成了“拉车屁股向后”的人。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”挖出了资产阶级的代表人物，并不等于肃清了他们的影响；挖掉了旧的资产阶级代表人物，还会产生新的资产阶级代表人物。我们应当深刻认识这个阶级斗争的规律，不要忘记阶级斗争。
    无产阶级革命派，要勇敢地拿起革命的铁扫帚，彻底清除各个领域里的资本主义和修正主义的遗毒，并且在这次伟大的革命斗争中，深刻地触及自己的灵魂，改造自己的灵魂，大破自己灵魂深处的资产阶级和小资产阶级的王国。如果我们不这样做，我们队伍中有的人就可能在资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的侵蚀下，逐渐“和平演变”，滑到修正主义的邪路上去，甚至有可能成为新的资产阶级代表人物，按照历史无情的辩证法，走向自己的反面。
    我们应当遵照毛主席的教导，不断革命，永远前进。
