A new bourgeois privileged class in the Soviet countryside is wielding power and oppressing the people. The broad masses of Soviet peasants are suffering severe exploitation.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Moscow, the Soviet revisionist leading clique is pushing for a comprehensive restoration of capitalism, forming a new bourgeois privileged class in the Soviet countryside. Soviet peasants are suffering severe exploitation at their hands.

According to Soviet publications, in the Soviet "collective farms," the farm chairmen, experts, and other leading personnel have formed a privileged class. They exploit the fruits of the peasants' labor, earning incomes ten to several dozen times higher than ordinary peasants, and enjoy "unreasonably high" remuneration. In the "Baku Worker" collective farm in the Azerbaijan Republic, the average monthly remuneration for leading personnel in 1965 was: farm chairman 1,076 rubles, chief accountant 756 rubles, chief agronomist and chief livestock specialist each 391 rubles. However, the remuneration for farm members was less than 38 rubles.

Due to such severe exploitation of the peasants, members have no interest in so-called "collective production." In the western regions of the Belarus and Ukrainian Republics, peasants work less than 160 days a year. In the Brest region, the average number of days each person participated in "collective production" was only 138 days per year.

Soviet peasants, especially the youth, cannot bear the exploitation and oppression, and are flocking to the cities in large numbers.

    农村中新的资产阶级特权阶层作威作福  
    苏联广大农民遭受严重剥削
    据新华社讯　莫斯科消息：苏修领导集团推行全面复辟资本主义的步骤，在苏联农村里形成了一个新的资产阶级特权阶层，苏联农民备受他们的剥削。
    据苏联报刊透露，在苏联的“集体农庄”里，农庄主席、专家以及其他居领导地位的人员，已经形成一个特权阶层。他们剥削农民的劳动成果，占有比一般农民高十倍到几十倍的收入，享受着“不合理的过高的”报酬。在阿塞拜疆共和国“巴库工人”集体农庄，一九六五年领导人员的平均每月报酬是：农庄主席一千零七十六卢布，总会计七百五十六卢布，总农艺师和总畜牧师各为三百九十一卢布。而农庄庄员的报酬却不到三十八卢布。
    由于农民受到这样惨重的剥削，庄员对所谓的“集体生产”根本没有兴趣。在白俄罗斯共和国和乌克兰共和国西部各州，农民劳动天数一年不到一百六十天。在布列斯特州平均每个人一年只参加了一百三十八天的“集体生产”。
    苏联农民、特别是青年不堪剥削和压榨，大批地流入城市。
