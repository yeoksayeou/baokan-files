The editorial board of *Hongqi* magazine: *Wenhui Daily* has published three editorials on how the proletarian revolutionary faction should hold and use power properly. These three editorials are well-written, raise timely and sharp issues, explain the principles correctly, and are very powerful. This journal is reprinting one of them for readers to study.

Currently, a major issue facing various levels of revolutionary committees (including grassroots revolutionary committees, such as those in universities, colleges, and factories) is how to hold and use power for the proletariat. This issue is about strictly following Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, correctly recognize and handle contradictions between the enemy and us and those within the people, continuously accumulate experience, summarize experience, and ensure that the revolutionary committees always remain red.

In the current situation, the key issue is whether power is held for the proletariat or for individuals and small groups. This reflects the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview within the people. As long as power is held wholeheartedly for the proletariat, experience can be accumulated from little to more, and things can be done from not very well to very well. One can learn things that are not familiar and make great strides on the path of Mao Zedong Thought. If power is sought for personal gain or for small groups, one will be misled by ghosts, unable to listen to Chairman Mao's words or the Party Central Committee's words, and act arbitrarily, forgetting the class enemy and directing the cannon at one's own class brothers. This will lead to errors in direction and line. Various levels of revolutionary committees must seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism among members who have selfish thoughts, helping them to quickly correct their mistakes.

*Wenhui Daily* points out: "We absolutely do not allow power struggles for personal gain. This evil thought must not be allowed even a little. If the character for 'power' and the character for 'self' become in-laws, thinking only about 'my' small group's power or 'my' power, it is like having a blindfold over one's eyes, seeing nothing, and falling flat on one's face. Those bewitched by 'self' often easily label opponents with hats like 'old conservative,' 'countercurrent,' 'restoration,' and without distinguishing right from wrong, propose to seize power again. If this continues, they may even seize the power of the proletarian revolutionary faction and direct the struggle spearhead at the proletarian headquarters." This is said so profoundly and well! Whether in places where revolutionary committees have been established or in places where they are being prepared, revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must be highly vigilant and not be bewitched by the ghost of 'self.' This is a new severe test for people in the process of the proletarian revolutionary faction seizing power and after seizing power.

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction still faces the issue of firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. Only by firmly grasping the direction of the struggle can power be held and used properly.

After seizing power, the main contradiction facing us is still between the proletariat and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Now, although the "devil king" has been overthrown, he has not been completely overthrown; although the "little devils" have been liberated, they have not been completely liberated. The "devil king" hates it to the core that the "little devils" hold great power and grinds his teeth at night. They are not willing to step down. They are not reconciled, not convinced, and will use every means to have the final showdown with us. The enemy is sharpening his knife, can we lower our flags and stop fighting? No! We must direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, criticize them deeply, thoroughly, overthrow them, and expose their crimes. We must never forget this direction of the struggle.

However, in some places, some comrades have not yet realized this. After seizing power, they almost forget the class enemy and the direction of the struggle. They are not interested in struggling against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party but are eager to engage in "internal wars." Some are even used by class enemies, either from the right or the ultra-"left," to pressure the young revolutionary committees, weakening proletarian dictatorship. Some comrades have even developed to the dangerous point of despising the authority of the proletariat and not listening to anyone.

Whose power is in our hands? It is given by the proletariat, by the people. The people have entrusted power to us, the proletarian revolutionary faction. We have only the duty to use this power to thoroughly destroy an old world, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, build a new world in great criticism and great struggle, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and absolutely no right to use this power to oppress our comrades or to create factionalism, cause splits, and damage unity.

We must always remember that we hold power for the revolution, for the proletariat, not for a small group or for 'self.' Holding power for the revolution, we must always think of the responsibility on our shoulders, always remember the entrustment of the entire proletariat, always study the new manifestations of class struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought as the compass, distinguish between enemies and friends, grasp the direction; unite the majority and strike at the handful. In this way, even if there are various contradictions within the revolutionary faction during the process of holding power, we can sit down calmly and solve them through serious criticism and self-criticism.

We absolutely do not allow power struggles for personal gain. This evil thought must not be allowed even a little. If the character for 'power' and the character for 'self' become in-laws, thinking only about 'my' small group's power or 'my' power, it is like having a blindfold over one's eyes, seeing nothing, and falling flat on one's face. Those bewitched by 'self' often easily label opponents with hats like 'old conservative,' 'countercurrent,' 'restoration,' and without distinguishing right from wrong, propose to seize power again. If this continues, they may even seize the power of the proletarian revolutionary faction and direct the struggle spearhead at the proletarian headquarters. Is this not enough to alert us! We hope these comrades quickly get rid of 'self' and replace it with 'public,' establishing the correct thought of seizing power for the revolution and holding power for the revolution.

To grasp the direction of the struggle, within the revolutionary faction, we must implement the correct policy of "upholding principles and strengthening unity," and resolutely oppose the wrong attitude of arbitrarily creating splits. Currently, the biggest political issue is to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This is our principle of unity. Without this principle, engaging in "internal wars" and creating splits will only cause pain to friends and joy to enemies, bringing great harm to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The revolutionary ranks should be increasingly consolidated, strengthened, and developed. Some people propose, "Within the revolutionary faction, there should still be great chaos." This is a splitist slogan, a reactionary fallacy. In places where the proletarian revolutionary faction has seized and held power, whoever proposes that there should still be "great chaos" is either ignorant or has ulterior motives. This slogan can only have the vicious effect of shaking military morale, dispersing fighting spirit, and providing conditions for class enemies to sabotage revolutionary forces. True revolutionaries should prioritize the overall situation, direct their guns at the enemy, and fight unitedly. Never be eager to study the "strategy and tactics" of "internal wars," engage in mutual intelligence gathering, and make secret moves behind the scenes. Never engage in beating, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting. Because doing so, "treating comrades as enemies, is to stand on the enemy's side." Whoever insists on doing so is actually consciously or unconsciously implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. We are confident that true proletarian revolutionaries will not do such things.

Currently, the struggle between the two lines has not ended, and the Cultural Revolution has not ended. We must remain sober-minded and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Otherwise, if we are not careful, we may fall into the enemy's trap, possibly committing directional and line errors, and even leading to the restoration of capitalism. Then, a revolutionary will become a fleeting figure.

With the development of the revolutionary situation, the task of the proletarian revolutionary faction to transform their worldview has become increasingly urgent. It should be seen that around us, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas are like poison gas, constantly attacking us. If we do not strengthen our ideological transformation and become conservatives of 'self' in our minds, then in no time, we will lose our way and lose our revolutionary nature. Therefore, we must continuously carry out the ideological revolution of eliminating 'self' and establishing 'public,' resolutely seizing the power of 'self' in our minds. Only in this way can we always follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and revolutionize to the end.

    念念不忘斗争大方向
    ——三论无产阶级革命派怎样掌好权用好权
    《文汇报》六月十一日社论
    《红旗》杂志编者按：《文汇报》连续发表了三篇论无产阶级革命派怎样掌好权用好权的社论。这三篇社论写得很好，问题提得及时、尖锐，道理讲得正确，也很有“杀劲”。本刊特转载其中的一篇，供读者学习。
    现在，摆在各级革命委员会（包括基层的革命委员会，例如大专院校的革命委员会、工厂的革命委员会）面前的一个重大问题，就是为无产阶级掌好权用好权的问题。这个问题，就是坚决照毛主席的指示办事，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们必须以毛泽东思想为指南，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，正确地认识和处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，不断地积累经验，总结经验，使革命委员会永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    就当前情况来说，关键性的问题是为无产阶级掌权还是为个人、为小团体争权、掌权。这是在人民内部反映出来的无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争。只要是全心全意地为无产阶级掌权，就能从经验不多到经验较多，就能从事情办得不太好到办得很好，就能学会不熟悉的东西，就能在毛泽东思想的道路上大踏步前进。如果是为个人争权，为小团体掌权，那就会被鬼迷了心窍，毛主席的话、党中央的话听不进去，而一意孤行，忘记阶级敌人，而把炮口对准自己的阶级弟兄。这样下去，就会犯方向路线的错误。各级革命委员会对自己的成员中有私心杂念的同志，必须认真地开展批评自我批评，帮助他们切实地迅速地改正错误。
    《文汇报》指出：“我们绝对不允许为个人争权。这个罪恶的念头一分也不能有。如果‘权’字与
  ‘私’字攀上了亲家，一门心思想着‘我’这一小团体的‘权’，或者‘我’的‘权’，这就等于眼睛蒙上了黑布，什么也看不见，就要栽跟斗。‘私’字迷了心窍的人，往往在碰到不同意见时，就轻易地给对方扣上‘老保’、‘逆流’、‘复辟’等大帽子，并且不分青红皂白地提出要再夺权。发展下去，甚至会去夺无产阶级革命派的权，会把斗争矛头指向无产阶级司令部。”这说得何等深刻，何等好呵！无论建立了革命委员会的地方，还是正在筹备建立革命委员会的地方，革命干部和革命群众组织的负责人，都要高度警惕，不要被“私”字这个鬼缠住。这一点，是在无产阶级革命派夺权过程中和夺权以后，对人们的新的严峻考验。
    无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，仍然有一个紧紧掌握斗争大方向的问题。只有紧紧掌握斗争大方向，才能掌好权、用好权。
    夺权以后，摆在我们面前的主要矛盾仍然是无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。现在，“阎王”虽已打倒，但未彻底打倒；“小鬼”虽已解放，尚未完全解放。“阎王”对于“小鬼”们掌握大权恨得要命，每天晚上躺在床上把牙齿磨得格格作响。他们是不甘心自己就此下台的。他们心不死，口不服，会想尽一切办法来和我们作最后的较量。敌人在磨刀，我们能偃旗息鼓吗？不能！我们必须把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们批深、批透、批倒、批臭，念念不忘这个斗争大方向。
    但是，在有些地区，有些同志还没有认识到这一点。他们在掌权以后，几乎忘记了阶级敌人，忘记了斗争大方向。他们对斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的兴趣不大，而是热衷于打“内战”，甚至被阶级敌人所利用，从右的方面，或者从极“左”的方面，对年轻的革命委员会施加压力，削弱了无产阶级专政。有的同志甚至发展到了藐视无产阶级的权威，什么人的话也不听的危险地步。
    我们手里的权是谁给的？是无产阶级给的，是人民给的。人民把权交给了我们无产阶级革命派，我们只有义务用这个权去彻底破坏一个旧世界，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在大批判、大斗争中建设一个新世界，巩固无产阶级专政，而绝没有资格用这个权去压自己的同志，或者以此闹山头主义，制造分裂，破坏团结。
    必须时刻记住，我们是为革命而掌权，为无产阶级而掌权，而不是为一个小团体掌权，为“私”掌权。为革命而掌权，我们就要时刻想到自己肩上的责任，时刻记住整个无产阶级的委托，时刻研究阶级斗争的新的表现形态，用毛泽东思想为指针，分清敌我友，掌握大方向；团结大多数，打击一小撮。这样，即使在掌权的过程中，革命派内部发生了这样那样的矛盾，也能心平气和地坐下来，通过认真的批评与自我批评，加以解决。
    我们绝对不允许为个人争权。这个罪恶的念头一分也不能有。如果“权”字与“私”字攀上了亲家，一门心思想着“我”这一小团体的“权”，或者“我”的“权”，这就等于眼睛蒙上了黑布，什么也看不见，就要栽跟斗。“私”字迷了心窍的人，往往在碰到不同意见时，就轻易地给对方扣上“老保”、“逆流”、“复辟”等大帽子，并且不分青红皂白地提出要再夺权。发展下去，甚至会去夺无产阶级革命派的权，会把斗争矛头指向无产阶级司令部。这难道不足以引起警惕吗！我们希望这些同志赶快丢掉“私”字，换上“公”字，树立为革命夺权，为革命掌权的正确思想。
    为了掌握斗争大方向，在革命派内部必须实行“坚持原则，加强团结”的正确方针，坚决反对随意制造分裂的错误态度。当前，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，这是最大的政治，也是我们团结的原则。离开了这个原则，打“内战”，闹分裂，只会使亲者痛，仇者快，对无产阶级革命事业带来莫大的损失。革命的队伍应该日益巩固、壮大和发展。有人提出，“革命派内部还要大乱特乱”。这是一个分裂主义的口号，是反动的谬论。在无产阶级革命派已经夺了权、掌了权的地方，谁提出还要“大乱特乱”，他不是无知，便是别有用心。这个口号只能起动摇军心、涣散斗志的恶劣作用，给阶级敌人破坏革命力量提供条件。真正的革命派应该以大局为重，枪口对敌，团结战斗。千万不要去热衷于研究“内战”的“战略战术”，互搞情报，背后做小动作。更不准打、砸、抢、抄、抓。因为那样做，“把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”谁要坚持那样做，实际上就是自觉或不自觉地贯彻资产阶级反动路线。我们坚信，真正的无产阶级革命派是不会那样干的。
    当前，两条路线的斗争并没有结束，文化大革命并没有结束。我们必须保持清醒的头脑，牢牢地把握斗争的大方向。否则，弄得不好，就会上敌人的当，就有可能重犯方向性路线性的错误，甚至导致资本主义复辟。那么，一个革命者，就会变成昙花一现的人物。
    随着革命形势的发展，无产阶级革命派改造自己的世界观的任务，越来越迫切了。应该看到，在我们的周围，资产阶级、小资产阶级思想象毒气那样，时刻在向我们喷袭过来。如果我们不加强思想改造，做头脑里“私”字的保守派，那么，不要多久，就会迷失方向，丧失革命性。因此，我们必须不断开展破“私”立“公”的思想革命，坚决夺头脑里“私”字的权。只有这样，才能永远沿着毛主席的革命路线，革命到底。
