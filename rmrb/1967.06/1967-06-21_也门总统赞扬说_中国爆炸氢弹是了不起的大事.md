Yemeni President Praises China's Hydrogen Bomb Test as a Great Event

SANA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Abdullah al-Sallal, on June 19, visited the Sana'a Textile Mill, which was built with Chinese aid. He said, "China's successful hydrogen bomb test is a great event. It is a significant support for the Vietnamese people and the Arab people who are fighting against U.S. imperialism."

Accompanied by Chinese Charge d'Affaires Zheng Kangping and Chinese experts, President Sallal praised the Sana'a Textile Mill, which was built with Chinese assistance, saying, "It is very well constructed." When Zheng Kangping mentioned that Chinese experts in Yemen are serving the Yemeni people wholeheartedly according to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, President Sallal pointed to the gleaming Mao badge on the Chinese friends' chests and said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world."

    也门总统赞扬说
    中国爆炸氢弹是了不起的大事
    新华社萨那十九日电　也门总统萨拉勒十九日参观由中国援助建成的萨那纺织厂时说：“中国氢弹爆炸成功是了不起的大事。它对正在同美帝国主义进行斗争的越南人民和阿拉伯人民是一个重大支持。”
    萨拉勒在中国临时代办郑康平和中国专家的陪同下参观这家纺织厂时，盛赞这家由中国帮助建成的萨那纺织厂“建筑得很好”。当郑康平谈到在也门的中国专家正按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导全心全意为也门人民服务时，萨拉勒指着别在中国朋友衣襟上金光闪闪的毛主席像章说：“毛主席是全世界的伟大领袖。”
