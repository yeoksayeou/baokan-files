Recently, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "be frugal and make revolution," Linxian County in Shanxi Province has enthusiastically launched a mass campaign to gather scattered wheat grains while simultaneously rushing to thresh the wheat. All 1,581 production brigades in the county have collected 1.82 million jin of wheat from the fields and roads, increasing the average yield per mu by 2.5 jin.

Linxian has had a bumper wheat harvest this year. Because of the bumper harvest, some people have developed the following thoughts: "Since we have a bumper harvest, losing a bit doesn't matter," and "The harvesting quality this year is better than in previous years, so there's not much to gain from gathering scattered wheat grains." In response to these active thoughts, the Linxian County Revolutionary Committee's Frontline Command Headquarters has launched a campaign to promote frugality and revolution across the county. The standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee have taken the lead in implementing the directives, going deep into the fields, and studying Chairman Mao's works with the community members while gathering wheat and propagating the political significance of gathering scattered wheat grains. Through propaganda and education, the community's awareness has been raised, and they have actively participated in the campaign to gather scattered wheat grains. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shandong Village Production Brigade said, "This year's wheat harvest is a result of Chairman Mao leading us in the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the Party. We must not waste a single grain."

    复拾小麦聚少成多
    最近，山西临猗县热烈响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，在突击碾打小麦的同时，积极开展了群众性的复拾小麦活动。全县一千五百八十一个生产队，已经从田间、路上拾回小麦一百八十二万余斤，每亩平均增收两斤半。
    临猗今年小麦获得丰收。由于丰收，有的群众产生了这样的思想：“丰收了，丢失一点没有啥”，“今年收割质量比往年好，复拾小麦油水不大”。针对这些活思想，临猗县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，在全县开展了“要节约闹革命”的宣传教育活动。县革命委员会的常委们，带头执行指示，深入田间，和社员一起学习毛主席著作，边拾麦边宣传复拾小麦的政治意义。通过宣传教育，群众认识提高，积极参加复拾小麦活动。山东庄生产大队贫下中农说：“今年小麦丰收了，这是毛主席领导我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的结果，我们决不能任意丢撒。”
