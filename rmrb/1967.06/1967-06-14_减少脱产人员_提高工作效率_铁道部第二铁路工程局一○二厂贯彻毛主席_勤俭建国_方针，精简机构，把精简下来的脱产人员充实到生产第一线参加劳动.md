The revolutionary workers of the 102nd Factory of the Second Railway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have responded to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call for reducing non-production personnel in industrial and mining enterprises and significantly improving work efficiency. They have reformed the irrational management system, promoting the revolutionization of management personnel's thinking and the development of production.

This repair and maintenance factory with over 500 workers had, under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, implemented a set of revisionist management methods that were detached from the masses and production. The bureaucracy was bloated, with multiple layers of management, and there were too many non-production personnel, which greatly constrained the workers' enthusiasm and hindered production development. After the revolutionary masses of this factory seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they proposed to streamline the organization and promote the revolutionization of enterprise management in conjunction with the factory's struggle, criticism, and transformation. After thoroughly studying the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country," and after extensive discussion and deliberation, they further proposed specific measures to streamline the organization and reform the management system.

In late March, the revolutionary committee of this factory, in response to the urgent demands of the majority of workers, officially announced the abolition of the original nine departments and the workshop dispatch level. Under the factory revolutionary committee, three offices were established to manage the revolution and production work across the factory: the Cultural Revolution Office, the Administrative Office, and the Production Office. The non-production personnel who were streamlined were all sent to the production front lines to participate in labor. After the workshop dispatch was abolished, production tasks were directly assigned to the work teams by the factory, and implemented by individuals. This reduced unnecessary approval and reporting procedures, saved manpower, and enhanced the workers' sense of responsibility and initiative as masters of the factory. Workers said, "Previously, it was 'production managing people,' but now it is 'people managing production.' The management of production reflects the primacy of human factors."

After the reform of the management system, the number of non-production personnel was reduced by half, accounting for only about 6% of the total workforce. Now, these personnel, following the principle of "concentrating at the factory level and serving at the work team level," participate in labor as ordinary workers, study Chairman Mao's works with the workers, assist the workers in carrying out the revolution, and arrange and manage the production of the work teams. They also help workers solve problems encountered in production. This further promoted the revolutionization of the thinking of management personnel.

After cadres and technicians participated in the work of the teams, they obtained firsthand materials and truly gained the right to command production, reducing or eliminating the past phenomenon of blind command and mutual shifting of responsibilities. The long-standing issue of workshops and teams not communicating with each other, and the phenomenon of downstream processes waiting for upstream processes to deliver goods, have gradually been eliminated. The relationship between cadres and the masses has also significantly improved.

Since the reform of the management system, due to the strengthening of production management work, the past phenomenon of slack production at the beginning of the month and rushed production at the end of the month to meet deadlines has been overcome. The factory's production plans for these few months have been completed relatively well.

    减少脱产人员  提高工作效率
    铁道部第二铁路工程局一○二厂贯彻毛主席“勤俭建国”方针，精简机构，把精简下来的脱产人员充实到生产第一线参加劳动
    新华社贵州十一日电　铁道部第二铁路工程局一○二厂的革命职工，响应毛主席和党中央关于工矿企业“既要大大减少脱离生产的人员，又要大大提高工作的效率”的号召，改革不合理的管理体制，促进了管理人员的思想革命化和生产的发展。
    这个有五百多名职工的修配厂，过去在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，推行一套脱离群众、脱离生产的修正主义管理办法，机构臃肿，层次重叠，非生产人员多，大大束缚了工人的积极性和阻碍了生产的发展。这个厂的无产阶级革命派从厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺取了领导权之后，他们就提出要结合本厂的斗批改精简机构，促进企业管理的革命化。他们认真学习了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》以后，经过充分的酝酿和讨论，进一步提出了精简机构、改革管理制度的具体措施。
    三月下旬，这个厂的革命委员会根据广大职工的迫切要求，正式宣布取消原有的九个股室和车间调度这一级的机构，在厂革命委员会下设立文化革命、行政和生产三个办公室分管全厂的革命和生产工作，精简下来的脱产人员一律充实到生产第一线参加劳动。车间调度取消后，生产任务由厂部直接布置到班组，落实到人。这样，就减少了不必要的批转、呈报手续，节约了人力，又增强了工人当家作主的高度责任感，调动了职工的生产积极性。工人们说，过去是“生产管人”，现在才是“人管生产”，生产管理上体现了人的因素第一。
    管理体制改革以后，非生产人员比原来减少了一半，只占全厂职工总数的百分之六左右。现在，这些人员也本着“集中在厂部，服务到班组”的原则，以一个普通劳动者的身份，到车间顶班劳动，同工人一起学习毛主席著作，协助工人抓好革命，安排和管理好班组生产，随时帮助工人解决生产中遇到的问题。这样，也进一步促进了管理人员的思想革命化。
    干部和技术员参加班组劳动以后，掌握了第一手材料，真正获得了指挥生产的发言权，减少或消除了过去那种瞎指挥和互相推卸责任的现象。过去长期存在的车间与车间、班组与班组、生产与后勤互不通气的局面，下道工序坐等上道工序交货的现象，现在逐步消除了。干部与群众的关系，也得到了很大改善。
    管理体制改革以来，由于生产管理工作得到进一步加强，过去那种月初生产松松垮垮、月底加班赶任务的现象已得到克服，全厂这几个月的生产计划都完成得比较好。
