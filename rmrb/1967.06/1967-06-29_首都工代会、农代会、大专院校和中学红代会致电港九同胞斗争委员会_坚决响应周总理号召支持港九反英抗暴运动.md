Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, the Red Guards' Congress of Capital Universities and Colleges, and the Red Guards' Congress of Capital Middle Schools all sent telegrams to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee today. They resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on June 24, firmly support the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots' anti-British and anti-violence struggle, and strongly condemn the series of fascist atrocities committed by British imperialism in persecuting Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots.

The Workers' Congress in its telegram of support said, "We, the workers of the capital, shout that the magnificent anti-British and anti-violence mass movement led by the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon is excellent! We fully support you, stand together with you, fight together with you, and win together with you! The telegram said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: 'Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore our lost territories on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand tall among the nations of the world.' Comrades, the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, who are at the forefront of the anti-British and anti-violence struggle, have, in this struggle, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely and tenaciously to defend national dignity, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and to counter the provocations of British imperialism. You have shown the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation and the backbone of the working class. You are truly the good sons and daughters of the motherland and the good examples of the working class. We salute you with the highest combat respect!"

The Peasants' Congress in its telegram of support expressed, "We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the capital, are filled with indignation and strongly denounce the heinous crimes of British imperialism! The old accounts that British imperialism owes to the Chinese people and the compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon must be settled, and the new debts must be repaid! Every drop of blood debt must be settled and repaid! The telegram said, "Premier Zhou pointed out in his speech: 'The legitimate rights of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, especially their sacred right to learn and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, must not be infringed upon by anyone.' British imperialism's attempt to prevent the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon from learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely impossible. Comrades, the peasants of Hong Kong and Kowloon, together with the workers, students, and patriotic compatriots of all walks of life, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and will surely defeat the paper tiger of British imperialism! We pledge to be your strong and reliable rear support!"

The Red Guards' Congress of Capital Universities and Colleges in its telegram of support warmly praised the patriotic compatriots of various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and waging a fierce struggle against British imperialism. The telegram said, "Your fearless, self-sacrificing, daring-to-fight, and daring-to-win great revolutionary spirit is excellent! We, the Red Guards of the capital, salute you with the highest combat respect! We firmly support all your actions and pledge to be your strong rear support! The telegram said, "Premier Zhou's speech has issued a combat call to the 700 million people of China and has sounded the death knell for British imperialism! We Red Guards will resolutely respond to Premier Zhou's call: 'We are determined, according to the needs of the situation, to give every support to the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong until final victory is achieved.'"

The Red Guards' Congress of Capital Middle Schools in its telegram of support pointed out, "British imperialism is the evil colonial ruler of Hong Kong, the mortal enemy of the 4 million compatriots of Hong Kong, the mortal enemy of the 700 million people of China, and the mortal enemy of tens of millions of Red Guards! British imperialism's fascist repression of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon has made us Red Guards extremely indignant. Listen, Hong Kong British authorities, don't be too arrogant! The Chinese people are not afraid of heaven or earth, let alone your few batons, a few decrees, and a few broken warships! The telegram said, "The Red Guards of Chairman Mao, who have achieved brilliant achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will never tolerate the bloody atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities on Chinese territory! We are prepared, and as soon as our red commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the front line of the struggle and fight side by side with the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon! Fight bravely, patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon! Fight bravely, patriotic youth of Hong Kong and Kowloon! The Chinese people support you, and Chairman Mao's Red Guards support you!"
