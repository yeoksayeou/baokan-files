Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mehmet Shehu send their warmest and most sincere congratulations on China's successful hydrogen bomb test.

The hydrogen bomb in the hands of the Chinese people is a historic victory for all revolutionary peoples of the world and a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

New China News Agency, June 19th report: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China received a telegram on the 18th from Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, and Comrade Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, congratulating China on the successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
To Vice Chairman Lin Biao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
To Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,

The Albanian people are extremely pleased and excited to learn that the People's Republic of China successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb on June 17, 1967, thus entering a very important new stage in the further development of nuclear weapons. The remarkable achievement of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the outstanding Chinese workers, engineers, technicians, and scientists in such a short period of time is a glorious victory for the glorious Communist Party of China and the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong in strengthening the national defense of the People's Republic of China and enhancing its international prestige.

Dear comrades, we are very pleased to represent the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and all the Albanian people, and in our personal capacity, to extend our warmest and most sincere congratulations to you, and through you to the great Chinese people, for this brilliant achievement in the field of nuclear science and technology.

Since its establishment to this day, the People's Republic of China has achieved brilliant successes in the socialist construction of the country and in the continuous strengthening of its national defense, conducting five nuclear weapon tests in less than three years, manufacturing atomic bombs, missiles, and now it also has its own hydrogen bomb.

The faithful and inseparable friends and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, the Albanian people, regard the detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb as their own achievement and as a great victory for all progressive and freedom-loving humanity. China's hydrogen bomb is a powerful weapon in the hands of the peoples of all countries against the aggressive policy and war policy of imperialism headed by the United States; it inspires the peoples of all countries who are fighting for national freedom and independence, against the pressures, threats, coercive policies, and nuclear monopoly of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and gives them strength and courage. The hydrogen weapon in the hands of the Chinese people is a historic victory for all revolutionary peoples of the world.

At this critical moment when the common enemies of humanity, the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionists, are hatching new plots against the heroic Vietnamese people, the freedom-loving Arab people, and the peoples of all countries, the glorious victory of China in successfully detonating its first hydrogen bomb is an incalculable and fatal blow to the enemies of peace and the freedom and independence of all peoples. Let the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and their accomplices tremble and lose their souls before this magnificent victory, their doom is certain, and the peoples of all countries will be victorious.

The victories of the Chinese people in building socialism and strengthening the national defense of their country, and the great victories of the ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, are the results of the correct leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, and the result of resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and opposing the bourgeois revisionist line that is hostile to revolution and Marxism-Leninism.

Dear comrades, we once again extend our most sincere fraternal congratulations on the great victory of the detonation of the first hydrogen bomb, and we sincerely wish the People's Republic of China, under the brilliant leadership of the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, greater and greater achievements in the socialist construction of the motherland and in strengthening the national defense of the motherland, for the benefit of the great Chinese people and all revolutionary peoples of the world.

    霍查谢胡同志致电毛主席林副主席周总理
    最热烈最衷心地祝贺我国氢弹爆炸成功
    中国人民手中掌握氢武器是世界一切革命人民具有历史意义的胜利，是对美帝苏修的致命打击
    新华社十九日讯　中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志、副主席林彪同志，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志今天收到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志十八日发来的祝贺中国成功地爆炸第一颗氢弹的电报。电报全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志，
    阿尔巴尼亚人民极其愉快和振奋地获悉中华人民共和国于一九六七年六月十七日成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹，因而在进一步发展核武器方面进入了一个十分重要的新阶段。中国人民解放军、杰出的中国工人、工程师、技术人员和科学家在短短的期间内所取得的这一惊人的成就，是光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想在加强中华人民共和国的国防力量和提高它的国际威望方面的又一辉煌胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，我们十分高兴地代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，并以我们个人的名义向你们，并通过你们向伟大的中国人民对在核科学技术领域内所取得的这一辉煌成就表示最热烈和最衷心的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国从它成立起到今天，在国家的社会主义建设和不断加强国防力量方面取得了辉煌成就，在不到三年的时间内进行了五次核武器试验，制造了原子弹，导弹，现在它又有了自己的氢弹。
    兄弟中国人民的忠实的和不可分离的朋友和战友阿尔巴尼亚人民，把中国第一颗氢弹的爆炸当作是自己的成就，当作是一切进步和爱好自由的人类的伟大胜利。中国的氢弹是世界各国人民手中反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的强大武器；它鼓舞着为争取民族自由和独立而进行斗争、反对美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的压力、恫吓、强权政策和核垄断的各国人民，并给他们以力量和勇气。中国人民手中的氢武器是世界一切革命人民的具有历史意义的胜利。
    在人类的死敌美帝国主义者及其帮凶苏联修正主义者对英雄的越南人民、爱好自由的阿拉伯人民和世界各国人民策划新阴谋的这一严重时刻，光荣的中国胜利地爆炸了第一颗氢弹，是对和平和各国人民自由、独立的敌人的不可估量的致命打击。让美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者及其帮凶在这宏伟的胜利面前丧魂落魄和发抖吧，他们的末日一定要到来，各国人民一定胜利。
    兄弟中国人民在建设社会主义和加强自己祖国国防力量方面所取得的胜利，正在中国胜利开展的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是光荣的中国共产党正确领导的结果，是坚决执行以伟大领袖毛泽东主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线、反对革命和马克思列宁主义的敌人的资产阶级修正主义路线的结果。
    亲爱的同志们，对第一颗氢弹爆炸的伟大胜利我们再一次向你们表示最真挚的兄弟祝贺，并衷心地预祝中华人民共和国在毛泽东同志的光辉思想的英明领导下，在祖国的社会主义建设、在加强祖国的国防力量方面取得越来越大的成就，以造福于伟大中国人民和世界一切革命人民。
      阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记
