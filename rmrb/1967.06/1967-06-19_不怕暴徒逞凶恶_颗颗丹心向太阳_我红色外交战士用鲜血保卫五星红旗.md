On June 16, the reactionary Indian government organized and planned to instigate a mob to attack the Chinese Embassy. This incident fully exposed the fascist nature of the Indian reactionaries. Our red diplomats' heroic performance in this anti-violence struggle radiated the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Thousands of Mobsters Gathered, Armed Police Cheering

Starting at 5 PM on June 16, batches of mobsters gathered at the gate of the Chinese Embassy in India. Initially, there were a few hundred, but later the number increased to over a thousand. These thugs, trained and organized by the Indian reactionary government, carried iron bars, stones, and glass shards. They were well-prepared and planned to destroy the Chinese Embassy and commit violence.

After shouting anti-China slogans, the mobsters began their attack. Some climbed over the north wall of the embassy, trampling on the international norms that prohibit entering foreign embassy premises. They then rampaged through the embassy grounds, causing destruction.

Notably, in the past few days, the Indian reactionary government had deployed a large number of armed police to surround the Chinese Embassy, obstructing the normal diplomatic activities of the embassy staff. Before the mob arrived at the Chinese Embassy on the 16th, the Indian government had sent two hundred police officers. However, when the mobsters invaded the embassy and committed violence, instead of stopping them, some police officers even directed and participated in the atrocities. This fully exposed that this incident was orchestrated and condoned by the Indian reactionary government.

Brows Furrowed, Facing the Criminals, Bravely Defending the National Flag

Some of the mobsters began throwing stones at the embassy's doors and windows, shattering the glass from north to south. The display cases and the ground-floor doors and windows of the Ambassador's residence, the Cultural Section office, and two other buildings were all smashed. At this moment, they saw the glorious Five-Star Red Flag flying high on the flagpole.

The reactionary class instincts of these criminals made them even more frenzied. They rushed forward to tear down our solemn national flag. Our eight comrades at the embassy, to maintain the dignity of the motherland, immediately rushed to the flagpole to defend the flag. A fierce battle ensued.

Our comrades stood tall and firm against the mob, undeterred by their shouts and threats, fearless of the stones thrown at them. Ten minutes passed, and all eight comrades had been injured, their clothes soaked in blood. However, they continued to stand and fight, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory!"

At this time, someone outside the embassy gate gave an order, and a large mob broke down the gate and rushed in, savagely beating our eight comrades who were bravely defending the flag.

Li Siheng was injured in the battle but continued to fight. He used his body to protect the First Secretary of the Embassy, Chen Luzhi. Later, Li Siheng fainted due to severe injuries, but as soon as he regained consciousness, he picked up the blood-stained "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read the chapter on "Revolutionary Heroism." Liu Zhongfu, while unconscious, opened his eyes and shouted, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice." He also told the party organization, "If I die, give the 300 rupees in my box as party dues." Zhang Delian, with blood continuously flowing from his head, repeatedly asked his comrades to take care of other seriously injured comrades and encouraged his comrades, saying, "Persistence is victory!" Chen Luzhi, during the mob's attack on the flag, led some comrades to provide support. In the intense battle, his head and body were injured, but he continued to direct the battle.

Other comrades who were seriously injured included Wang Liren, Hong Chuanjia, Shen Ganbei, and Li Zhaojian. Each of the eight comrades had more than ten injuries, with their heads broken and blood covering their faces as they lay on the ground. However, as Chairman Mao said, "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies," they continued to recite Chairman Mao's quotations, encouraging each other.

Persistence is Victory, the Five-Star Red Flag Flies High

The mobsters stole one of our Five-Star Red Flags, but another Five-Star Red Flag immediately rose high on another flagpole on the roof of the embassy office building! It shone brightly, fluttering in the wind.

When the mobsters were committing violence, the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy, Chen Zhaoyuan, was negotiating with the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Joint Secretary Meda. The embassy staff repeatedly called Meda to inform the Chinese Charge d'Affaires, but Meda's secretary refused to relay the message. The embassy staff also repeatedly called the Acting Director of the East Asia Division of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Secretary to the Prime Minister, strongly protesting this unprecedented atrocity in the history of international diplomacy. However, those who answered the phone all claimed that they could not find the person. It was not until after 7 PM that the embassy staff managed to contact Chen Zhaoyuan. Chen Zhaoyuan immediately lodged the strongest protest to Meda, denouncing his attempt to shirk responsibility, and demanded that he go to the scene. Meda, unable to escape, accompanied Chen Zhaoyuan to the back door of the embassy but then cowardly made an excuse and fled.

The mobsters also set fire to the Chinese Embassy's garage. The Indian fire brigade came, but they did not put out the fire; they just looked for five minutes and then left.

All signs clearly indicate that the Indian reactionary government is the direct organizer and mastermind behind this atrocity. The Indian reactionary government's spy sent to China was caught in the act by the Chinese people, but in a fit of anger, they publicly disregarded international norms, fabricated excuses, and carried out revenge, truly reaching the depths of despicability.

Maintaining Vigilance, Ready to Resist Violence at Any Time

The staff of the Chinese Embassy in India are now maintaining vigilance, boosting their morale, and preparing to counter any attacks by the Indian reactionaries. Their hearts are with our great leader Chairman Mao and the distant motherland. The seven hundred million people of the motherland are their strong support. Although they are few in number, they are not alone. "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." No matter how crazy and cunning the enemy is, no matter what difficulties and obstacles there are, our red diplomats are determined to continue to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

### 不怕暴徒逞凶恶　颗颗丹心向太阳  我红色外交战士用鲜血保卫五星红旗

    不怕暴徒逞凶恶　颗颗丹心向太阳
    我红色外交战士用鲜血保卫五星红旗
    六月十六日印度反动政府有组织、有计划地指使暴徒袭击中国大使馆，这个事件充分暴露了印度反动派的法西斯面目。我们的红色外交战士在这场抗暴斗争中的英勇表现，放射出伟大的毛泽东思想的万丈光芒。
    上千暴徒麕集　武装军警助威
    六月十六日下午五时起，一批批暴徒来到中国驻印度大使馆门口，起初几百人，后来陆续增加到一千几百人。这些印度反动政府豢养的便衣特务和纠集的流氓，带着铁棍、石块、玻璃片等凶器。他们是有准备、有计划地来破坏中国大使馆和行凶的。
    暴徒们在疯狂地叫喊了一阵反华口号以后，就开始动手。一些暴徒爬过使馆北面的围墙，野蛮地践踏了不得侵入外国使馆范围的国际关系准则，到使馆院内疯狂破坏。
    值得注意的是，这几天，印度反动政府出动了大批武装军警，包围中国大使馆，阻碍使馆人员的正常外交活动。在十六日暴徒到达中国大使馆以前，印度政府先派来了两百名警察，但是当暴徒侵入使馆行凶时，他们不但不加阻拦，有些人还亲自指挥和参与了暴行。这就完全暴露出这个事件是在印度反动政府的指使和纵容下发生的。
    横眉怒对凶犯　英勇保卫国旗
    部分暴徒开始用石块砸使馆的门窗玻璃，从北到南，使馆的展览橱窗和大使楼、文化处办公楼等和另外两座楼房等建筑物的底层门窗全部被砸破。这时候，他们看到了飘扬在高高的旗杆上的光辉灿烂的五星红旗。
    反动的阶级本能使这些凶犯更加疯狂了。他们扑上去，要扯我们庄严的国旗。我们使馆的八位同志为了维护祖国的尊严，立即跑到旗杆下，英勇地卫护国旗。一场激烈的战斗展开了。
    我们的同志横眉冷对大批暴徒，不顾他们的吼叫和胁迫，不怕他们投来的石块，威严地挺立着。十分钟过去了，八位同志已经先后受伤，血染衣衫，但是他们继续挺立着，坚持着，一面战斗，一面高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    这时候，使馆门外有人发出命令，大批暴徒撞开了大门，蜂拥而来，疯狂地毒打我们英勇护旗的八位同志。
    李思衡同志在战斗中已经负伤，但他仍然坚持着，并且以身体卫护大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直同志。后来李思衡同志因为伤重昏迷过去，但他一清醒就拿起被血染红的《毛主席语录》，阅读“革命英雄主义”那一章。刘忠富同志在昏迷状态下睁开眼睛，高呼“下定决心，不怕牺牲”。他还向党组织表示说：“万一我牺牲了，箱子里的三百卢比交作党费吧。”章德良同志自己头部不断流血，但是他一再要同志们去照顾其他重伤的同志，并且鼓励战友们说：“坚持下去就是胜利！”陈鲁直同志在暴徒围攻国旗时，带领一些同志前往支援，在激烈的战斗中，他的头部和身体都被打伤，但是仍然坚持指挥战斗。
    同时受重伤的同志，还有王里仁、洪传家、沈干北、李兆乾。八位同志每人受伤都在十处以上，头部都被打破，血流满面，躺在地上。但是，正象毛主席所说，“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”，他们继续朗诵毛主席语录，互相鼓舞。
    坚持就是胜利　五星红旗飘扬
    暴徒们抢走了我们的一面五星红旗，但是，另一面五星红旗马上在使馆办公楼顶上另一根旗杆上高高升起！它光辉灿烂，迎风飘扬。
    暴徒行凶时，中国大使馆临时代办陈肇源正在向印度外交部联合秘书梅达交涉事宜。使馆的同志多次打电话给梅达，要中国代办听电话，但是梅达的秘书始终拒不肯转告。使馆同志还多次打电话给印度外交部东亚司代理司长、外交部部长秘书、总理秘书，强烈抗议这件世界外交史上骇人听闻的暴行，但接电话的人都推脱说找不到人。直到晚上七点多钟，使馆同志才设法与陈肇源代办联系上。陈肇源立即向梅达提出最强烈的抗议，痛斥他企图推卸罪责的谬论，并要他同赴现场。梅达不得已陪陈肇源到使馆后门口，又卑怯地托辞溜走。
    暴徒又放火烧中国大使馆的车库，印度消防队装模作样地来了，但是它根本不去灭火，看了五分钟就溜了。
    各种迹象都很清楚地表明：印度反动政府是这场暴行的直接组织者和幕后牵线人。印度反动政府派到中国去的间谍分子在作案时被中国人民当场拿获，却恼羞成怒，公开无视国际关系准则，捏造借口，进行报复，真是卑鄙到了极点。
    继续保持警惕　随时准备抗暴
    中国驻印度大使馆的同志，现在继续保持警惕，提高斗志，随时准备迎击印度反动派的进攻。他们颗颗红心向着我们伟大的领袖毛主席，向着遥远的祖国。祖国的七亿人民是他们的坚强后盾，他们人数虽少，却毫不孤单。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”不管敌人怎样疯狂和狡猾，不管有什么困难和障碍，我国的红色外交战士决心继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进！　新华社
