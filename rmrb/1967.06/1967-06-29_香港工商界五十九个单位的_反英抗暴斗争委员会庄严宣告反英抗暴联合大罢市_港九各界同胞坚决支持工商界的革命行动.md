Hong Kong, June 28 — The Anti-British Struggle Committee of fifty-nine business units in Hong Kong, including small traders, department stores, grain and oil, food, seafood, local products, herbal medicines, building materials, and publishing and printing, solemnly declared today that starting from June 29, they will hold a united strike against British oppression for four days.

The declaration said, "The great motherland calls on the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon to take all possible actions politically, economically, and culturally to launch a powerful counterattack against the colonial rule of British imperialism. Our united strike is a practical action taken under this call!"

The declaration said, "The purpose of our united strike is the same as the united strike of the workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is to safeguard the dignity of the Chinese nation, to defend our sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and to intensify our struggle against the brutal national oppression of British imperialism, especially the recent bloody suppression and savage massacre of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Our struggle is directly aimed at the British imperialists who rule Hong Kong."

The declaration called on the patriotic compatriots of the business community in Hong Kong and Kowloon to take unified action and participate in the united strike, making the British imperialists taste the iron fist of the patriotic compatriots.

The declaration said, "We hope that our united strike will receive the broad support and active cooperation of the business community in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Chairman Mao teaches us, 'We Chinese people have dignity.' We must carry forward the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation. We hope that the business community compatriots who have not yet joined the united strike will support us in every way, so that we can successfully complete the task of the united strike and give the British imperialists the punishment they deserve!"

The declaration said, "We also hope that our united strike will receive the sympathy and assistance of the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. British imperialism has oppressed us for more than a hundred years in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and now it is pressing down on us with unbearable national oppression. Apart from uniting to overthrow British imperialism, we have no other way out. We should make joint efforts and take all possible actions and effective measures from all sides to strive for the thorough victory of the anti-oppression struggle!"

The declaration said, "The current situation of the anti-British struggle of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon is very good and getting better! Premier Zhou Enlai solemnly declared in his speech on June 24: 'The Chinese people are determined to support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong in every way, according to the needs of the situation, until the final victory is achieved.' The strong support of the motherland has greatly boosted the fighting spirit of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We must not disappoint the great expectations of the motherland. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite and organize ourselves, form a surging anti-imperialist and anti-oppression army, and give a severe blow to the evil British imperialism!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 28 — The Anti-British Struggle Committee of various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Anti-British Struggle Committee of the business community in Hong Kong and Kowloon issued statements, warmly praising and firmly supporting the four-day united strike against British oppression by the Anti-British Struggle Committee of fifty-nine business units in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The statement by the Anti-British Struggle Committee of various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon said: The business community's united strike is an active response to the call of the great motherland, a powerful support for the general strike of workers in various industries, and another heavy blow to British imperialism. The statement by the Anti-British Struggle Committee of the business community in Hong Kong and Kowloon said: The action of the fifty-nine business units' struggle committee to hold a united strike is excellent! It sets a good example for us in the business community of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    香港工商界五十九个单位的
    反英抗暴斗争委员会庄严宣告反英抗暴联合大罢市
    港九各界同胞坚决支持工商界的革命行动
    新华社香港二十八日电　香港工商界小贩、百货、粮油、食品、水产、土产山货、南北药材、建筑材料、出版印刷等行业五十九个单位的反英抗暴斗争委员会，二十八日发表联合宣言，庄严宣告：从六月二十九日起，将举行反英抗暴联合罢市四天。
    宣言说，伟大的祖国号召港九爱国同胞从政治上、经济上和文化上采取一切可能的行动，向英帝国主义的殖民统治发动强大的反击。我们的联合罢市，就是在这个号召下所采取的实际行动！
    宣言说，我们联合罢市的目的，同港九工人的联合大罢工一样，是为了维护中华民族的尊严，是为了捍卫我们学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，是为了加倍反击英帝国主义残酷的民族压迫，特别是最近对我港九爱国同胞的血腥镇压和野蛮屠杀。我们斗争的矛头直接指向统治香港的英帝国主义。
    宣言呼吁港九工商界爱国同胞采取一致行动，参加联合罢市，让港英尝尝爱国同胞铁拳的滋味。
    宣言说，我们希望，我们的联合罢市，将会获得港九工商界同胞的广泛支持和积极合作。毛主席教导说：“我们中国人是有骨气的。”我们就是要发扬中华民族的英雄气概。我们希望目前尚未参加联合罢市的工商界同胞，从各方面配合我们，使我们得以胜利完成联合罢市的任务，使港英帝国主义受到应有的惩罚！
    宣言说，我们也希望，我们的联合罢市，同样获得港九广大同胞的同情和协助。英帝国主义在港九压迫我们一百多年，现在又以不能忍受的民族迫害压在我们头上，我们除了团结起来打倒英帝国主义之外，再无其他出路。我们应当共同努力，从各个方面采取一切可能的行动和有效的手段，争取反迫害斗争的彻底胜利！
    宣言说，目前港九同胞反英抗暴斗争的形势很好，越来越好！周恩来总理在六月二十四日的讲话中严正宣告：“中国人民决心根据形势的需要，给予香港爱国同胞以一切支援，直到取得最后胜利。”祖国的强有力支援，大大鼓舞了港九爱国同胞的斗志。我们一定不辜负伟大祖国的期望，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步团结起来，组织起来，结成浩浩荡荡的反帝抗暴大军，狠狠地打击万恶的英帝国主义！
    据新华社香港二十八日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和港九工商界反对港英迫害斗争委员会发表声明，热烈赞扬和坚决支持港九工商界五十九个单位反对港英迫害斗争委员会举行联合大罢市四天的反英抗暴行动。港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会声明说：工商界联合罢市，是积极响应伟大祖国的号召，是对各业工人大罢工的有力配合，也是对港英帝国主义的又一沉重打击。港九工商界反对港英迫害斗争委员会声明说：工商界五十九个单位斗委会联合罢市的行动，好得很！给我们港九工商界作出了良好的榜样。
