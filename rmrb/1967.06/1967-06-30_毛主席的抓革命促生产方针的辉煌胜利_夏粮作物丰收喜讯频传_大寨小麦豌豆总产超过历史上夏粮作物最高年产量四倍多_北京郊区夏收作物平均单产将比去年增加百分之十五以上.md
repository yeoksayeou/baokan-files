The glorious victory of Chairman Mao's policy of revolution and production
Good news of summer grain harvests is pouring in
Da Zhai's total production of wheat and peas exceeds the highest historical yield of summer grains by more than four times
The average yield of summer crops in the suburbs of Beijing will increase by more than fifteen percent compared to last year

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taoyuan, June 28th: The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought shining on the agricultural front of our country—Da Zhai Brigade of Da Zhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province—has once again transmitted a thrilling report of production victory amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: This year's summer grain crops have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with the total yield of wheat and peas exceeding the highest historical yield of summer grains by more than four times. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are filled with the joy of harvest, enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!"

Da Zhai Brigade's bumper harvest of summer grains this year is a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary masses, gives a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev, and sets a brilliant example of "revolution and production" for the vast rural areas of the country.

The revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Da Zhai Brigade have put revolution in the first place, used revolution to lead production, and actively participated in the struggle to seize power from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee. They have actively engaged in the great criticism movement. The great criticism has become a powerful driving force for production.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary cadres and members of Da Zhai Brigade enthusiastically responded to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position that is prior to everything, higher than everything, heavier than everything, and greater than everything. Everyone studies and applies, using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie, using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against nature, and using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and dedicate themselves to the revolution. This has effectively promoted the field management of summer crops.

On the May 1st International Labor Day this year, our great leader Chairman Mao received Comrade Chen Yonggui, which gave great encouragement to the members of Da Zhai. To live up to the warm concern and expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao, they continued to carry forward the spirit of bravely fighting, fearing no fatigue, and engaging in continuous battles. They timely strengthened the field management of summer grain crops. Before the wheat harvest, the members of Da Zhai overcame the hail disaster and ensured a bumper harvest of summer grains.

According to Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: Amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the summer harvest in the suburbs of Beijing has entered its peak. Recently, reporters visited many poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres on the front lines of the summer harvest. They spoke joyfully about the excellent situation of this year's summer harvest in the suburbs of Beijing and unanimously pointed out: This is a glorious victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to lead agricultural production.

Wherever the reporters went, they saw and heard a scene of bumper harvests. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, in the fields with waving red flags and rolling wheat, talked about how this year's summer crops were sown on time, managed carefully, harvested cleanly, and had a higher yield than in previous years. Deng Wantian, the head of the core group of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Representatives Congress and the head of Zhai Li Brigade, Songzhuang Commune, Tongxian County, excitedly said: The summer harvest situation in the suburbs is unprecedentedly good. For example, in our Zhai Li Brigade, the yield per mu and the total yield of more than 3,000 mu of wheat have far exceeded last year's. This season's harvest almost caught up with the grain production of the entire year in the past. We plan to hand in the state-purchased grain as soon as the summer harvest is completed and ensure the overfulfillment of the task.

From the harvesting situation in various places in the suburbs of Beijing, it can be seen that this year's summer grains have achieved a bumper harvest. According to preliminary estimates by relevant departments, the average yield per unit area of summer crops will increase by more than fifteen percent compared to last year.

While celebrating the harvest, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with numerous examples, once again explained a great truth—good production relies on Mao Zedong Thought. This summer's crops, from sowing to harvesting, were all carried out in the midst of the fervor of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Zhang Fenglan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Representatives Congress and a member of Ta Bay Brigade, Chengguan Commune, Fangshan County, recalled the well-digging of their brigade last winter during the harvest. At that time, it was the coldest days of the year, digging wells on rocks, and the north wind blew so hard that people could hardly breathe. At this difficult moment, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," studying while digging wells. Under the great inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, they fought for three months and completed the well. Together with the original two wells, it ensured that the wheat fields were adequately irrigated during the drought and achieved a bumper harvest.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres deeply felt from the summer harvest that: studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to lead production, first of all, is to seize the revolution and class struggle. During the summer harvest, many brigades and teams turned the wheat fields, threshing floors, and kang beds into battlefields. During rest times, they held small-scale criticism meetings and bitter-sweet remembrance meetings, criticizing the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the party, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. When reporters visited Zhao Zhixi, the secretary of the branch of Nan Gao Production Team, Zhong Al Friendship Commune, Chaoyang District, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Representatives Congress, he talked about how since the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this team have always insisted on production during the day and revolution at night, with revolution greatly promoting production.

Students and teachers from the capital are harvesting the bumper wheat with the community members in Dongwang Commune, Haidian District.

    毛主席的抓革命促生产方针的辉煌胜利
    夏粮作物丰收喜讯频传
    大寨小麦豌豆总产超过历史上夏粮作物最高年产量四倍多  北京郊区夏收作物平均单产将比去年增加百分之十五以上
    据新华社太原二十八日电　我国农业战线上闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的红旗——山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队，在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，又传出令人振奋的生产捷报：今年夏粮作物获得空前大丰收，小麦和豌豆的总产量超过历史上夏粮作物最高年产量的四倍多。广大贫下中农和革命干部满怀丰收的喜悦，纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    大寨大队今年夏粮大丰收，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！它大长无产阶级革命派的志气，给中国的赫鲁晓夫当头一棒，为全国广大农村树立了“抓革命，促生产”的光辉榜样。
    大寨大队的革命干部和广大贫下中农，把革命放在首位，以革命统帅生产，积极参加了向原山西省委、晋中地委和昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，积极投入革命的大批判运动。革命的大批判成为推动生产的强大动力。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，大寨大队的革命干部和社员热烈响应林彪副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作放在先于一切，高于一切，重于一切，大于一切的位置，人人学，人人用，用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级，用毛泽东思想战天斗地，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，破私立公，一心为革命，有力地促进了夏收作物的田间管理。
    今年“五一”国际劳动节，我们伟大领袖毛主席接见了陈永贵同志，给大寨社员以巨大的鼓舞力量。为了不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和希望，他们继续发扬勇敢战斗，不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，及时地加强了对夏粮作物的田间管理工作。在小麦收获前，大寨社员又战胜了冰雹灾害，保证了夏粮大丰收。
    据新华社二十九日讯在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，北京郊区夏收已经进入高潮。记者最近访问了战斗在夏收第一线的许多贫下中农和革命干部，他们怀着喜悦的心情，畅谈了今年京郊夏收的大好形势，一致指出：这是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，是活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅农业生产的成果。
    记者所到之处，耳闻目见，一片丰收景象。贫下中农和革命干部，在红旗飘扬、麦浪翻滚的田野中，谈到了今年的夏收作物种得及时，管得细致，收得干净，产量比往年高。北京市农代会核心组组长、通县宋庄公社翟里大队队长邓万田激动地说：市郊夏收形势是空前大好。比如我们翟里大队，三千多亩小麦，亩产量、总产量都大大超过了去年。这一季的收成几乎追上了过去全年的粮食产量。我们准备夏收一完，就交售征购粮，保证超额完成任务。
    从京郊各地收打的情况来看，今年郊区夏粮获得了大丰收。据有关方面初步估计，夏收作物平均单位面积产量将比去年增加百分之十五以上。
    在欢庆丰收的时候，广大贫下中农和革命干部用无数事例，再次说明了一个伟大的真理——搞好生产靠的是毛泽东思想。今年夏收作物从种到收，都是在活学活用毛主席著作的热潮中进行的。北京市农代会常委、房山县城关公社塔湾大队社员张凤兰在丰收中回忆起他们大队去冬打井的情形。那时，正是数九寒天，在石头上打井，北风刮得人气都透不过来。在这困难的时刻，贫下中农和革命干部翻开了红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一面打井一面学习。在伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞下，他们奋战三个月，把水井修成了。它和原先的两口井一起保证了麦田在干旱时得到充分浇灌，夺得了丰收。
    广大贫下中农和革命干部从夏季丰收中深深体会到：活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，首先就要抓革命，抓阶级斗争。夏收中，许多社队把麦地、场院、炕头当战场，在休息时间，召开小型批判会、忆苦思甜会，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，对旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和地、富、反、坏、右分子开展批判斗争。记者访问北京市农代会常委、朝阳区中阿友好公社南皋生产队支部书记赵志玺时，他谈到从文化大革命以来，这个队的贫下中农和革命干部一直坚持白天搞生产，晚上闹革命，革命大大促进了生产。（附图片）
