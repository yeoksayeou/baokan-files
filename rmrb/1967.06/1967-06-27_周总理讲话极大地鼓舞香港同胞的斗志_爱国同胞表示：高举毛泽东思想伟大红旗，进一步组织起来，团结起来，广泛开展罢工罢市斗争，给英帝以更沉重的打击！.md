Premier Zhou's speech has greatly inspired the fighting spirit of Hong Kong compatriots. Patriotic compatriots have expressed: "Hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, organize and unite further, launch extensive strikes and boycotts, and deal a heavier blow to the British imperialists!"

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, June 26 — When Premier Zhou Enlai's strongest condemnation of British imperialism and firm support for the Hong Kong patriots' anti-British and anti-violence struggle reached Hong Kong, the workers of various industries and other patriotic compatriots on the front lines of the anti-British and anti-violence struggle felt immense joy and inspiration. With hearts full of excitement, they sincerely thanked the great leader Chairman Mao and the 700 million people of the motherland for their boundless concern and greatest support, and unanimously expressed that they would resolutely follow Premier Zhou's instructions, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, organize and unite further, form a vast anti-British and anti-violence army, and deal a more severe blow to British imperialism!

Workers who began a joint strike on June 24, after reading Premier Zhou's powerful speech in the newspapers, cheered and became even more determined. They held meetings. The dock and warehouse workers, who paralyzed the harbor transportation during the joint strike, said: "From the beginning of our joint strike, we heard Premier Zhou's strongest voice representing Chairman Mao and the 700 million people supporting us, which greatly inspired and gave us endless strength. We will definitely respond to the motherland's call and, with resolute actions in the great strike, give a double blowback to British imperialism!" The workers said: "Hong Kong and Kowloon have always been Chinese territory. Learning and propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a sacred right of Hong Kong patriots that cannot be infringed upon. However, the Hong Kong authorities, fearing and hating Mao Zedong Thought to death, used bloody suppression to infringe upon our sacred rights, which is absolutely intolerable. We must give a double blowback to the British imperialists' mad provocations!"

The public bus workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon, participating in the great strike, excitedly expressed at a meeting: "Premier Zhou's speech is the strongest and most inspiring voice, which has given us boundless courage. We will more bravely counterattack British imperialism and will not rest until we achieve complete victory!"

The oil workers and tugboat workers participating in the joint strike held a joint meeting today. The workers read Premier Zhou's speech at the meeting and unanimously expressed: "Premier Zhou's speech expresses the boundless concern and strong support of the 700 million people of the motherland for Hong Kong compatriots. The fate of Hong Kong depends on the Hong Kong patriots and the 700 million Chinese people, not on British imperialism. If the Hong Kong authorities insist on being enemies of the Hong Kong compatriots, we will, at any time, respond to the motherland's call and resolutely and thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism!"

The workers of Hong Kong Electric and Telephone, who control the lifelines of Hong Kong's public utilities, sincerely thanked Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for their support. The electric workers said: "Premier Zhou's speech gave us strong support, making us full of confidence. We will definitely unite further, form an even larger anti-British and anti-violence army, launch a magnificent movement to despise, scorn, and ridicule British imperialism, launch a stronger counterattack, and fight British imperialism to the end!" Many telephone workers expressed: "The motherland has given us such great support, we will definitely not disappoint the motherland's expectations, and we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the anti-persecution struggle to the end."

The shipyard workers who resolutely participated in the joint strike said: "Premier Zhou's speech filled us with confidence in victory. We workers are people with backbone. We are not afraid of the enemy's suppression, nor are we tempted by the enemy's bribes. We have made up our minds, fearing no sacrifices, to fight the dying British imperialism to the end!"

The Hong Kong rubber and plastic workers, who were brutally suppressed by the Hong Kong authorities on June 23, excitedly expressed: "When we were subjected to British imperialism's bloody persecution, Premier Zhou immediately issued a stern warning to British imperialism and firmly supported our anti-British and anti-violence struggle. We express a thousand and ten thousand thanks for the motherland's boundless concern and support! We have made up our minds, fearing no sacrifices, to tread on the bloodstains of the anti-violence martyrs, resolutely fight to the end with the evil British imperialism, make it pay the blood debt, and avenge our class brothers who were killed!"

The responsible persons and spokespersons of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British and Anti-Violence Struggle Committee also issued statements one after another. They excitedly said: "Premier Zhou's speech expresses the great leader Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland's intimate care and great support for us. We fully support it and sincerely thank them. They said, the fate of Hong Kong depends on the 400,000 compatriots of Hong Kong and the 700 million people of the motherland, and absolutely not on a handful of British imperialists."

The spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee said, we should actively respond to the motherland's call: launch a magnificent movement to despise, scorn, and ridicule British imperialism, thoroughly expose the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong for more than a hundred years; mobilize and organize further, launch extensive strikes and boycotts, and use all effective means to strike at British imperialism.

The spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee said in a speech: The great support from the motherland has given us great inspiration and boundless courage. We must make up our minds to strive for the final victory of the anti-persecution struggle. He said: Now the workers' main force has blown the new advance signal, we young students should also take immediate action. To support the workers' joint strike, we 32 patriotic schools have decided to jointly suspend classes for one day to express the strongest protest against British imperialism's even more brutal persecution of our patriotic workers and compatriots!

The spokespersons of the Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committees of the Hong Kong and Kowloon publishing and printing industry, South China film workers, Hong Kong and Kowloon business community, as well as education, banking, trade, hawkers, and various industries also issued statements. They resolutely expressed: We must respond to the motherland's call, launch a magnificent movement to despise, scorn, and ridicule British imperialism, and in the political, economic, and cultural fields, launch a stronger counterattack against British imperialism, making the dying British imperialism smash into pieces against the iron wall of Hong Kong patriots!
