Chinese Red Guards delegation head Yao Wenyuan, on the afternoon of the 26th, on behalf of all Red Guards in China, delivered a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League, which is currently being held here. The speech was received with extremely enthusiastic applause by all the delegates present.

The beloved great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, attended the afternoon session of the congress.

When Yao Wenyuan began his speech by mentioning that the Chinese Red Guards delegation had brought greetings from our great leader Mao Zedong to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League, the entire hall erupted in cheers. All the delegates stood up and applauded enthusiastically and continuously, shouting "Enver—Mao Zedong!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" This fully expressed the Albanian youth's boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao.

After Yao Wenyuan's speech, accompanied by the first secretary of the Albanian Labor Youth League Central Committee, Meho, he walked to Hoxha's side. Hoxha warmly shook hands and embraced Yao Wenyuan, and together they raised their hands, joining the delegates in shouting slogans of revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Albania. At this moment, applause and shouts of "Enver—Mao Zedong!" blended together, lasting for about ten minutes. After the afternoon session ended, Hoxha walked down from the podium and warmly shook hands and embraced the members of the Chinese Red Guards delegation. The hall was once again filled with a scene of intense excitement. Shouts of "Enver—Mao Zedong!" "Long live the friendship between China and Albania!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" echoed through the air!

After Yao Wenyuan's speech, on behalf of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, he presented a banner to the congress. The banner read:

	Albanian Labor Youth League Fifth Congress

	The peoples and youth of China and Albania must unite closely, overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of all countries, and strive to create a world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation!

	Chinese Red Guards Delegation
	June 1967

Yao Wenyuan also, on behalf of the Chinese Red Guards, presented the most precious gift of the Red Guards—an embroidered portrait of our great leader Mao Zedong wearing the Red Guards armband for the first time last year on August 18—to the congress. The first secretary of the Albanian Labor Youth League Central Committee, Meho, accepted the delegation's gift on behalf of the Albanian youth and warmly shook hands and embraced Yao Wenyuan. At this moment, the entire hall stood up and enthusiastically cheered for the combat friendship between the youth of China and Albania.

When the afternoon session ended, amidst a chorus of cheers, the Albanian and other international delegates present had warm conversations with the Chinese Red Guards. Many Albanian delegates gave the Chinese Red Guards scarves they had received while participating in the construction of the Logarzi-Fieri railway, which featured a design symbolizing the Albanian people fighting with a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other. The Chinese Red Guards pinned glowing Mao badges and "Long live China-Albania friendship!" commemorative badges, symbolizing the great friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Albania, onto the delegates' chests, and they embraced each other tightly, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" and "Long live China-Albania friendship!"
