The joint performance by the revolutionary art soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Beijing was excellent, truly excellent! This comment reflects the sentiments of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This performance was indeed excellent. It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, and a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This performance was excellent. It dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism, boosting the morale of China's revolutionary proletariat, and vindicating the honor of China's revolutionary literary and art workers. This successful performance gave the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries a heavy blow, refuting their slander against China's Cultural Revolution with living facts. This successful performance also gave the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their cohorts a heavy blow, overturning the distorted history with revolutionary rebellion, allowing workers, peasants, and soldiers to truly occupy the stage of literature and art. This successful performance also gave a heavy blow to those who stubbornly pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, achieving great unity in the great criticism through practical actions. The revolutionary art soldiers participating in the joint performance of the three services held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, beat the drums of revolution, and marched onto the stage of literature and art in a grand manner!

The performance began with the solemn and uplifting song "The East Is Red." As the curtain slowly rose, the audience was immediately transported into a world of red. The first item was a large-scale song and dance performance titled "Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Brilliant Work 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,'" featuring over 300 participants. It vividly portrayed the spirit of the "Talks" on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the combat role of literature and art, and the immersion of literary and art workers among the masses through three quotations and rich dance movements. It showcased the resolute will and magnificent spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries occupying the stage of literature and art. The entire performance was filled with a fighting spirit. The top capitalist-roader within the Party vehemently opposed playing drums and performing the Yangge dance, attempting to strangle the fine revolutionary traditions. This item began with playing drums and performing the Yangge dance, jumping, twisting, and singing loudly. At the same time, the entire performance used vivid contrast to depict the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries in destroying the old and establishing the new. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary literary and art workers, brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, smashing the remnants of the old society to pieces! They drove off all the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, and the dead from the stage, allowing the heroic figures of workers and peasants, who create history, to stand tall on the socialist stage. They let the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought shine with a million rays of light, illuminating the world and making it red.

"The Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art" is a large-scale song and dance performance created to commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of the "Summary of the Forum on Army Literature and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing." The performers, with hearts full of joy, excitement, and happiness, sang and danced enthusiastically, celebrating the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art. The performance also vividly depicted Jiang Qing's outstanding contributions to the cultural revolution through excerpts from the symphony "Shajiabang," the Beijing opera "The Red Lantern," and the ballet "The White-Haired Girl."

"The Performance of Revolutionary Historical Songs" is a large-scale song and dance performance that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. This item was created by collecting revolutionary songs from several historical periods in China's revolution. Its creation and performance also went through a struggle. At that time, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary academic "authorities" within and outside the military had slandered this item as a "four-not-like," "lacking artistic value," and "saluting, handshaking, and marching in unison," among other things. This time, the proletarian revolutionary soldiers of the three services re-arranged and performed this item, achieving a great victory! This revision more prominently highlighted the red line of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the scene "Victory Song of Anti-Surrounding," they added a song and dance praising the "Gutian Meeting," and in the scene "Long March," they added a scene of the "Zunyi Meeting," enthusiastically praising the historical significance of these two meetings and expressing their respect and love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The one-act, two-scene song and dance drama "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Ship" vividly expressed the longing of the broad cadres and soldiers of the Navy for Chairman Mao through moving artistic performances. Additionally, the military band's performance was powerful and majestic, filled with revolutionary fighting spirit. The solo performances by Zhang Yingzhe and Jia Shijun were also distinctive. They sang Chairman Mao's poems and quotation songs with deep faith and love for Chairman Mao, moving the audience deeply.

These performances were resounding, red, and bright. The performers used their fiery revolutionary emotions, magnificent revolutionary language, clear revolutionary songs, and powerful revolutionary dances to enthusiastically praise the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and propagate the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They prominently depicted the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the literary and art front, truly using literature and art "as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind." Therefore, they could inspire the audience's revolutionary spirit, give the audience great strength, and also arouse the audience's strong hatred for the top capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Why could the revolutionary art soldiers of the three services perform such excellent items? Firstly, they love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, accelerating their own ideological revolutionization and tempering themselves in the fiery revolutionary mass movement of great struggle and great criticism. Therefore, they had a clear direction and bright eyes in the fierce and complex struggle between the two classes and two lines, stood firm, and fought fiercely. They were not afraid of difficulties or being besieged, steadfastly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, and resolutely acting according to the Party's policies. Secondly, this creation and performance were the voices from the hearts of every revolutionary art soldier, the result of creating according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin on army literature and art work. The revolutionary literary and art workers of the three services had long harbored a strong desire and enthusiasm to create the best items, using practical actions to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," expressing their love for Chairman Mao. When the "Summary of the Forum on Army Literature and Art Work" was published, they were so excited that they shouted with joy, immediately creating and rehearsing the item "The Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art" with deep revolutionary feelings for Vice Chairman Lin, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, and Comrade Jiang Qing. Their slogan was: "Design the plan tonight, rehearse tomorrow, and perform the day after tomorrow." They said it and did it. In the process of creation, they seriously implemented the "three-in-one" combination of revolutionary leading cadres, professional creators, and revolutionary masses, pooling their wisdom, dividing their labor, and working together with high spirits and fighting spirit. They demonstrated the spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous fighting, creating, rehearsing, and performing these items in the shortest time and at the fastest speed. To complete this creation and performance task, the band members copied and practiced scores day and night, the chorus members sang lyrics tirelessly, the dancers rehearsed despite fatigue and injuries, and the stage workers also actively cooperated, with good deeds emerging one after another. This was the result of Mao Zedong Thought nurturing, the great power of spirit turning into matter.

The success of this performance also had another very important reason: it truly achieved great unity in revolution. For the common goal of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary art soldiers of the three services united and worked together in solidarity. They fought their way out in the fierce struggle between the two lines and formed a powerful propaganda army. The revolutionary art soldiers of the joint performance of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Beijing were doing revolutionary work, performing revolutionary plays, and walking the revolutionary path. On the political stage, they shouted loudly to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and on the literary and art stage, they sang and danced loudly to propagate Mao Zedong Thought! They set a good example for revolutionary literary and art workers across the country.

    做革命人　演革命戏　走革命路
    ——评驻京陆海空三军革命文艺战士联合演出		齐学青
    “三军文艺战士联合演出好得很，硬是好得很！”这句评语，说出了广大工农兵观众的心里话。这次演出就是好，它是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。这次演出就是好，它大灭了帝国主义和现代修正主义的威风，大长了我国无产阶级革命派的斗志，为我国革命的文艺工作者争了气。这次成功的演出，给帝、修、反当头一棒，以活生生的事实有力地驳斥了他们对我国文化大革命的污蔑；这次成功的演出，给我国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其同伙当头一棒，以革命造反的精神，把颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来，让工农兵真正占领了文艺舞台；这次成功的演出，给少数顽固推行资产阶级反动路线的人当头一棒，以实际行动在革命的大批判中实现了革命的大联合。参加三军联合演出的革命文艺战士高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，擂动革命的战鼓，浩浩荡荡地“杀”上了文艺舞台！
    演出是在庄严而嘹亮的《东方红》歌声中开始的，当大幕徐徐升起之后，立即把观众引进了一个红彤彤的天地。头一个节目就是由三百多人参加演出的大型歌舞《欢庆毛主席的光辉著作〈在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话〉发表二十五周年》。它以《我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的》、《要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分》和《到群众中去》这三支语录歌曲和丰富的舞蹈动作，突出地表现了《讲话》中关于文艺为工农兵服务，文艺的战斗作用，文艺工作者深入工农兵群众的光辉思想；表现了无产阶级革命派占领文艺舞台的坚定意志和豪迈气魄。整个节目充满着战斗的气息。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，竭力反对打腰鼓，扭秧歌，妄图扼杀优良的革命传统。这个节目一开始就出现打腰鼓、扭秧歌，大跳、大扭、大唱。同时，整个节目又以鲜明的对比手法，表现了无产阶级革命派大破大立的革命精神。广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把旧社会遗留下来的残渣余孽统统砸个稀巴烂！把什么帝王将相、才子佳人、死人，统统赶下了舞台，让创造历史的工农兵英雄形象屹立在社会主义舞台上，让光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想放射万道霞光，普照大地，把全世界照得红彤彤的。这个节目也表现了革命文艺战士永远捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，全心全意地为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的决心。
    《毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁》是为纪念《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》发表一周年而创作的大歌舞。演员们怀着无限喜悦、激动和幸福的心情，载歌载舞，热烈地欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线的胜利。歌舞还通过交响音乐《沙家浜》、京剧《红灯记》和芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》中三段精彩的场面，形象地表现了江青同志在文化革命中的卓越贡献。
    《革命历史歌曲表演唱》是一部闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的大歌舞。这个节目是广泛地收集了我国几个革命历史时期的革命歌曲而编写成的。它的创作和演出也经历过一番斗争。当时，军内外一小撮反革命修正主义分子和反动学术“权威”曾污蔑这个节目是“四不象”，“没有艺术性”，是“敬礼、握手加个齐步走”等等。这次三军的无产阶级革命派的战士们，重新改排上演了这个节目，这是一个巨大的胜利！这次修改，更加突出了毛主席的革命路线的红线。在《反围攻凯歌》这场戏中加进了歌颂“古田会议”的歌舞，在《长征》一幕戏中加进了一场“遵义会议”，热情地颂扬了这两次会议光辉的历史意义，表达了对伟大领袖毛主席的崇敬和热爱。
    《毛主席来到我们军舰上》这个一幕两场的歌舞剧，通过生动感人的艺术表演，表达出了海军广大指战员日夜想念毛主席的心情。此外，军乐演奏雄壮有力，气势磅礴，充满着革命的战斗的豪情。张映哲、贾世骏同志的独唱也各具特色，他们怀着对毛主席无限信仰、无限热爱的深情，放开雄浑有力、热情豪迈的歌喉，大唱毛主席诗词和毛主席语录歌曲，观众深受感动。
    这些节目，都是响当当、红彤彤、亮堂堂的。演员们用火热的革命感情，豪迈的革命语言，嘹亮的革命歌声，雄壮的革命舞蹈，热情地歌颂了全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，宣传了光焰无际的毛泽东思想；突出地表现了文艺战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，真正把文艺“作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”所以能够鼓舞观众的革命斗志，给观众以巨大的力量，也能够激发起观众对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的强烈仇恨。
    三军的革命文艺战士们，为什么能演出这样好的节目呢？首先是他们最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，他们活学活用毛主席著作，加速自己的思想革命化，在大斗争、大批判的火热的革命群众运动中得到了锻炼。正因为如此，所以他们在激烈复杂的两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，方向明，眼睛亮，站得稳，干得猛。他们不怕困难，不怕受围攻，坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，牢记毛主席的教导，紧紧地掌握住了斗争的大方向，坚决按照党的政策办事。其次，这次创作和演出都是出自每个革命文艺战士内心的呼声，是遵循毛主席的革命文艺路线，遵循林副主席对部队文艺工作指示进行创作实践的结果。三军的革命文艺工作者早就怀着强烈的愿望和满腔的热情，要创作出一些最好的节目，用实际行动纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，以表达对毛主席的热爱。当《部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》公开发表的时候，他们激动得欢呼起来，怀着对毛主席的亲密战友林副主席和对江青同志的最深厚的革命感情，马上突击创作、排演《毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁》这一节目。他们的口号是：“今晚设计方案，明天排练，后天台上见”。他们是这样说的，也是这样做的。在创作的过程中，他们认真地执行了革命的领导干部、专业创作人员和革命群众“三结合”的创作方法，群策群力，分工合作，个个意气风发，斗志昂扬，发扬了不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，在最短的时间里，用最快的速度，创作、排练和演出了这些节目。为了完成这次创作和演出的任务，乐队队员不分昼夜地抄谱练习，合唱队员们废寝忘食地背唱歌词，舞蹈演员不怕劳累带病带伤坚持排练，舞台工作人员们也积极配合，好人好事层出不穷。这是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，这是精神化为物质的巨大威力。
    这次演出的成功，还有一个很重要的原因这就是真正实现了革命的大联合。为了宣传毛泽东思想这个共同的目的，三军的革命文艺战士联合起来了，团结一致，共同努力。他们在两条路线的激烈斗争中杀出来了，而且形成了一支强有力的宣传大军。驻京陆海空三军联合演出的革命文艺战士们，做的是革命人，演的是革命戏，走的是革命路。在政治舞台上，他们为捍卫毛泽东思想而大喊大叫，在文艺舞台上，他们为宣传毛泽东思想而大唱大跳！他们为全国革命文艺工作者树立了一个好榜样。
