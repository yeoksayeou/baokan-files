Angry Shouts of "Down with American Imperialism!" "Down with Soviet Revisionism!"
Arab People's Demonstrations Target American Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism
Masses in Various Countries Attack American and British Institutions and Storm Soviet Embassies

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, facing the mad aggression of the United States and Israel and the "ceasefire" conspiracy plotted by the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, the people of various Arab countries have been in high spirits and united in their hatred of the enemy. They have continued to hold massive demonstrations and take actions to severely punish the aggressors.

In the large Yemeni city of Taiz, 5,000 people held a demonstration on the 10th against the armed aggression of the U.S. and Israel on Arab countries. The demonstrators shouted, "We want Palestine, down with American imperialism!" Angry demonstrators threw stones at the Soviet Embassy in Taiz and shouted, "The Soviet revisionists are traitors, China is our true friend!"

On the same day, in the important Yemeni city of Hodeidah, thousands of workers also held a march and demonstration, denouncing the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the interests of the Arab people. The indignant workers stormed the Soviet consulate and smashed the doors and windows. The workers shouted, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the traitor Kosygin!"

All Yemeni workers in the Soviet revisionist factory in Hodeidah went on strike to protest the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the interests of the Arab people.

In recent days, people in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a have heard angry protests against the Soviet revisionists everywhere. They almost unanimously said, "The Soviet Union is the biggest accomplice of American imperialism! The Soviet Union is the biggest traitor to the Arab people!"

In the capital of the United Arab Republic, Cairo, the angry people of the UAR held a demonstration near the Soviet Embassy on the 10th, shouting slogans to overthrow Soviet revisionism. The staff of the Soviet Embassy were so scared that they hid inside and dared not come out.

On the 10th, the people of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, held a grand demonstration and march against the aggression of the U.S. and Israel on Arab countries. Thousands of angry masses also demonstrated in front of the Soviet Embassy. They pointed at the Soviet Embassy and shouted, "The Soviet revisionists are cowards!" "We will fight together with our brothers in Syria until the final victory!"

Following this, the demonstrators marched in order to the Chinese Embassy, expressing their thanks to China for its sincere support of the Arab people's anti-aggression war. The demonstrators continuously shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" They excitedly said, "The People's Republic of China is our sincere brother. The People's Republic of China firmly supports us, while the Soviet Union is revisionism and a traitor. It has betrayed us. Its crimes will be recorded in history. They will be punished!"

On the same day, the Executive Committee of the Iraqi Trade Union Federation wrote a letter to the Soviet Ambassador to Iraq, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people. The letter pointed out, "The stance of the Soviet government is capitulationist, a clear surrender to the forces of world imperialism."

The letter said, "The workers of Iraq clearly and frankly believe that the Soviet Union must be held responsible for the imperialist aggression caused by its capitulationist behavior."

In Algeria, demonstrations continued on the 10th, with demonstrators continuously shouting slogans such as "We will fight."

In recent days, several anti-Soviet revisionist demonstrations have also been held in Sudan. On the 10th, Sudanese youth attacked the American Cultural Center in Khartoum with incendiary bombs, causing the American library to be destroyed.

In Aden, under British colonial rule, the people on the 10th attacked a British cotton plantation 40 miles east of Aden, destroying the plantation's office.

    据新华社十二日讯　阿拉伯各国人民，面对着美国、以色列的疯狂侵略和美、英、苏串通一气策划的“停火”阴谋，近日来，群情激昂，同仇敌忾，继续举行声势浩大的示威，并采取行动，严惩侵略者。
    在也门大城市塔伊兹，五千群众十日举行反对美、以武装侵略阿拉伯国家的大示威。示威者高呼：“我们要巴勒斯坦，打倒美帝国主义！”愤怒的示威者向塔伊兹的苏联大使馆扔石块，并高呼：“苏修是背叛者，中国是我们的真正朋友！”
    同一天，在也门重要城市荷台达，数千工人也举行了游行示威，声讨苏修出卖阿拉伯人民的利益的罪行。示威工人义愤填膺地冲进苏联领事馆，并砸碎了门窗玻璃。工人们高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒叛徒柯西金！”
    在荷台达苏联修配厂内工作的全体也门工人，为了抗议苏修出卖阿拉伯人民的利益，举行了罢工。
    在也门首都萨那，这些天来，人们到处听到抗议苏修、谴责苏修的愤怒的呼声。他们几乎异口同声地说：“苏联是美帝国主义的大帮凶！苏联是阿拉伯人民的大叛徒！”
    在阿联首都开罗，愤怒的阿联人民十日在苏联大使馆附近举行示威，高呼打倒苏联修正主义的口号。苏联大使馆人员吓得躲在屋里不敢出来。
    伊拉克首都巴格达人民十日举行盛大示威游行，反对美帝和以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略。数千名愤怒的群众还到苏联大使馆门前示威。他们指着苏联大使馆喊道：“苏修是胆小鬼！”“我们要同叙利亚的兄弟们共同战斗，直到最后胜利！”
    接着，这些示威者又列队来到中国大使馆门前，感谢中国对阿拉伯人民反侵略战争的真诚支持。示威者不断高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“人民中国万岁！”激动地说：“人民中国是我们真诚的弟兄。人民中国坚决支持我们，而苏联是修正主义和叛徒。它出卖了我们。它的罪行将载入史册。他们将受到惩罚！”
    同一天，伊拉克工会总联合会执行局写信给苏联驻伊拉克大使，强烈谴责苏修领导集团背叛阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争。信件指出：“苏联政府的立场是投降主义的，是向世界帝国主义势力的明显的投降。”
    信件说：伊拉克的工人明确坦率地认为，苏联必须对由于它的投降行为而导致帝国主义的侵略负责。
    在阿尔及利亚，十日继续举行群众示威，示威者不断高呼：“我们要战斗”等口号。
    数日来，在苏丹也举行了好几次反对苏修的示威。苏丹青年十日用燃烧弹袭击了美国在喀土穆的文化中心，使美国图书馆遭到了破坏。
    在英国殖民主义者统治下的亚丁，人民十日袭击了亚丁以东四十英里的一个英国棉花种植园，捣毁了种植园的办公室。
