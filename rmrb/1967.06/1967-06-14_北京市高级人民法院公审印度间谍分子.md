Beijing High People's Court Publicly Trials Indian Spy

Over ten thousand people attended the trial. The trial declared: Lu Guannan is guilty of espionage and is sentenced to expulsion from the country, to be executed immediately.

The Chinese people are good at distinguishing between friends and enemies. We have always provided conveniences for foreign missions and personnel in China who respect China's sovereignty and abide by the laws of the Chinese government. However, for those with ulterior motives, for those who dare to infringe upon our sovereignty and endanger our security, regardless of the guise they wear, we will thoroughly expose them, resolutely strike them down, and show no mercy!

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: The Beijing High People's Court held a public trial today for Lu Guannan, an Indian spy disguised as a diplomat at the Indian Embassy in China. The trial declared: Lu Guannan is guilty of espionage and is sentenced to expulsion from the country, to be executed immediately.

Today's public trial reflects the high revolutionary vigilance and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It also reflects the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. It once again shows that imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries who attempt to carry out conspiracies in China will inevitably fall into the Chinese people's net and will surely receive the punishment they deserve.

The public trial was held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. Over fifteen thousand revolutionary masses from various sectors of the capital attended the trial to expose and condemn the crimes of the spy Lu Guannan. The entire venue was filled with angry shouts: "Down with the Indian reactionaries! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Severely punish the Indian spy Lu Guannan! Resolutely purge all imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary spies in China! All spies will not escape the Chinese people's net!"

At 3 PM, the public trial began. Attendees from the capital, including workers, commune members, People's Liberation Army soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, sang "The East Is Red" loudly and reviewed the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "We must never relax our vigilance against the desperate revenge plots of the imperialists and their running dogs just because we have achieved victory. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position."

The representative of the Beijing High People's Court announced that the Indian spy Lu Guannan from the Indian Embassy in China, fearing the judgment of the Chinese people, dared not appear in court. The trial proceeded in absentia. At this moment, the entire audience of revolutionaries angrily raised their fists and shouted: "Severely punish the Indian spy Lu Guannan! Down with the Indian reactionaries!"

The representative of the Beijing People's Procuratorate read the indictment at the public trial. The indictment stated that it has been established: the defendant, former Second Secretary of the Indian Embassy in China, Lu Guannan, committed espionage in our country. On the afternoon of June 4, 1967, the defendant Lu Guannan, together with the Third Secretary of the Indian Embassy in China, Vijay, drove to a certain location in the western suburbs of Beijing to spy on and photograph our military restricted area, taking more than ten clear photographs of the terrain of the restricted area and its surrounding regions, which formed a complete map of the area. Lu Guannan was caught in the act by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

The indictment stated that before this, the defendant Lu Guannan violated Chinese laws, taking advantage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to engage in extensive espionage activities. He had repeatedly infiltrated the internal areas of our party and government agencies and the reception station of the Central Cultural Revolution Group of the Communist Party of China, collecting our political and military intelligence. Lu Guannan also disguised himself as a diplomat or student from a friendly Asian-African country to steal our intelligence and was repeatedly caught or driven away by Red Guards and revolutionary masses.

The indictment stated that the defendant Lu Guannan had long been engaged in espionage activities under the guise of a diplomat, stealing our political and military intelligence, seriously endangering our national security. The indictment demanded that the spy Lu Guannan be punished according to the law.

Witness, Li Wenjie of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, then spoke. He angrily exposed the espionage activities of the Indian Embassy personnel and introduced the situation of Lu Guannan and Vijay being caught red-handed while spying on and photographing our military restricted area on June 4th. He said, "Our country is a proletarian dictatorship. Those who engage in espionage activities and firmly oppose the Chinese people must be punished accordingly."

He said, "The Indian reactionaries have long followed the Americans and Soviets in adopting a hostile attitude towards our country, acting as the clowns in the anti-China chorus. Under the instigation of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, they have repeatedly provoked incidents in the China-India border region and even launched armed invasions against our country. They have openly colluded with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his gang, and together with the Chiang spies, they have brutally persecuted our compatriots in India. They have raised the traitor Dalai Lama, attempting to return to Tibet and let this slave owner ride on the heads of the Tibetan people again, and so on. To safeguard the sacred territory and sovereignty of our country, we have repeatedly given the Indian reactionaries resolute rebuffs and exposures. However, the Indian reactionaries are unrepentant. At the crucial moment of the two-class, two-line struggle in our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, driven by their class instincts and with the support of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, they used their legal status as diplomatic personnel in China to engage in espionage activities, collecting and stealing our intelligence, committing another heinous crime against the Chinese people."

He said, "We solemnly warn American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. Your every attempt at sabotage will not succeed and will inevitably end in shameful failure."

Li Wenjie said, "The People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally created and led by Chairman Mao. We remember Chairman Mao's teachings, holding our guns tightly, and resolutely striking down all domestic and foreign class enemies who sabotage our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and endanger our national security, safeguarding our sacred territory from any invasion, and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Next, representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, the Beijing Farmers' Congress, and the Red Guards spoke at the public trial. With deep hatred for the class enemies, they expressed great indignation at Lu Guannan's heinous crimes and demanded severe punishment for the spy Lu Guannan. They also lodged the strongest protest against the Indian Embassy in China. They said:

"The Indian reactionaries have long collaborated with the Americans and Soviets, acting as anti-China clowns, consistently opposing the great Chinese people. The espionage activities of the Indian Embassy personnel are part of the Indian reactionaries' anti-China criminal activities. The spy Lu Guannan has been exposed by the Chinese people, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

"Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will never deviate from this logic.' Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries are terrified of our magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are trying every means to sabotage and disrupt it, steal our intelligence, and engage in espionage activities. We sternly warn you: the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have sharp eyes. All the ghosts and snakes engaging in espionage activities in China will not escape the grasp of the Chinese people. If you insist on your ways, you will not have a good ending!"

"We Red Guards solemnly warn spies like Lu Guannan that under the proletarian dictatorship, great democracy is for the people. For you and all the ghosts and snakes at home and abroad, there is no democracy, not even half of it! We only allow you to behave properly and honestly, not to talk or act recklessly! If you don't believe it, try our Red Guards' iron fists! We Red Guards must have high vigilance. We must expose and parade all the international spies disguised as diplomats like Lu Guannan who engage in illegal activities on our territory!"

"Currently, international class struggle is sharp and complex. The enemy is constantly sabotaging and disrupting us. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and strengthen our awareness of international class struggle. We must act according to the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin Biao: always remember class struggle, always remember the proletarian dictatorship, always remember to emphasize politics, and always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Let us, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, build our country into an iron fortress of socialism that will never change color for thousands of generations, and make the plots of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to restore capitalism in China completely fail!"

The presiding judge of the Beijing High People's Court Special People's Court read the verdict. The verdict listed Lu Guannan's various espionage activities in our country and stated that Lu Guannan's espionage activities had ample evidence and could not be denied. The facts fully proved that the defendant Lu Guannan had long been engaged in espionage activities under the guise of a diplomat, blatantly disregarding the laws of the People's Republic of China, and openly engaging in espionage activities on Chinese territory, seriously endangering our national security and must be punished according to the law. The Special People's Court, in accordance with the laws of the People's Republic of China, sentenced the defendant Lu Guannan to expulsion from the country, to be executed immediately. The evidence, including the photographic negatives, will be confiscated. The verdict takes effect immediately.

After the verdict was read, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, strongly supporting this just verdict. People continuously shouted: "Long live the proletarian dictatorship! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Heighten revolutionary vigilance and safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Fan Pujun, member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and head of the Political and Legal Affairs Group, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, announcing the final doom of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries. People around the world are overjoyed, but imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries are terrified and enraged. On one hand, they are using their propaganda machines to slander our country, and on the other hand, they are trying every means to steal our political, military, and economic intelligence. They instruct their personnel and journalists in China to sneak around, deceive, and engage in a series of evil schemes."

He pointed out that the frenzied activities of international class enemies precisely show that the closer they are to their end, the more frantically they struggle to the death.

Fan Pujun said, "We revolutionary people and Red Guards must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, be ready at any time to smash the enemies' plots and tricks, and resolutely defend our country's security and interests, and defend the proletarian dictatorship!"

Fan Pujun said, "The Chinese people are good at distinguishing between friends and enemies. We have always distinguished between the people of various countries and the reactionaries of various countries, and between our friendly countries and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. For our friends, we have always acted in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, being friendly, supportive, and helpful to each other. We actively help them understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction in our country. For foreign missions and personnel in China who respect China's sovereignty and abide by the laws of the Chinese government, we have always provided them with conveniences for their work. However, for those with ulterior motives, for those who dare to infringe upon our sovereignty and endanger our security, regardless of the guise they wear, we will thoroughly expose them, resolutely strike them down, and show no mercy! This is our policy, and this is our attitude."

After the public trial, the revolutionary masses cheered, and everyone was full of fighting spirit, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and prevent all sabotage activities by class enemies to safeguard the great proletarian dictatorship.

The shameful espionage activities of the Indian Embassy personnel enraged the revolutionary masses from all sectors. Today, the Red Guards and revolutionary masses from the capital, holding up Chairman Mao's portraits and waving banners, marched in batches to the gates of the Indian Embassy in China, posting banners and big-character posters, strongly protesting against the espionage activities of the Indian Embassy personnel in Beijing.

This morning, all Chinese staff of the Indian Embassy in China walked out of the gates of the Indian Embassy and handed a letter of protest to the acting head of the Indian Embassy in China, Shati. The Chinese staff strongly condemned the serious crimes of the Indian Embassy personnel engaging in espionage activities in the letter of protest.

In front of the gates of the Indian Embassy in China, people angrily shouted: "Resolutely purge all imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary spies in China! Severely punish the Indian spy Lu Guannan! Down with the Indian reactionaries! Down with American and British imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism!"

Beijing High People's Court held a public trial on June 13th for Lu Guannan, an Indian spy disguised as a diplomat at the Indian Embassy in China.

    保卫无产阶级文化大革命　保卫伟大的无产阶级专政
    北京市高级人民法院公审印度间谍分子
    一万多人参加大会。公审大会上宣判：鲁冠南犯间谍罪，判处驱逐出境，立即执行
    中国人民是善于区别敌友的。凡是尊重中国主权，遵守中国政府法令的外国驻华机构和人员，我们一向给予他们工作上的便利。但是，对于那些别有用心的分子，那些敢于侵犯我国主权、危害我国安全的帝、修、反间谍分子，不管他们披着什么外衣，我们一定要彻底揭露，坚决打击，决不留情！
    新华社十三日讯　北京市高级人民法院今天举行公审大会，公审披着外交官外衣的印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南。公审大会上宣判：鲁冠南犯间谍罪，判处驱逐出境，立即执行。
    今天的公审大会，体现了取得无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的中国人民所具有的高度革命警惕性和革命精神，体现了我国无产阶级专政的强大威力。它再一次说明：帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派要在中国进行阴谋活动，就一定逃不出中国人民的天罗地网，一定要受到应得的惩罚。
    公审大会在北京工人体育馆举行。首都各界革命群众一万五千多人参加公审大会，审判、揭发和声讨间谍分子鲁冠南的罪行。全场群情激愤，“打倒印度反动派！打倒美帝国主义！打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“严惩印度间谍分子鲁冠南！”“坚决肃清一切帝修反在华的间谍分子！”“一切间谍分子休想逃出中国人民的天罗地网！”的愤怒口号声此起彼伏，响彻会场。
    下午三时，公审大会开始。参加大会的首都工人、公社社员、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将和革命干部，高声齐唱《东方红》，并重温伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    北京市高级人民法院代表宣布，印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南，因害怕中国人民的审判，不敢出庭，现在进行缺席审判。这时，全场革命群众愤怒地振臂高呼：“严惩印度间谍分子鲁冠南！”“打倒印度反动派！”
    北京市人民检察院代表在公审大会上宣读公诉书。公诉书中说，已经查明：被告、原印度驻华大使馆二等秘书鲁冠南在我国犯有间谍罪行。被告鲁冠南于一九六七年六月四日下午，伙同印度驻华大使馆三等秘书维杰，驾车至北京西郊某地，向我军事禁区进行窥测，并偷摄该禁区及其附近区域的地形照片十余张，这些照片清楚地构成该地区完整的地形图。鲁冠南在进行上述活动时被中国人民解放军战士当场拿获。
    公诉书说，在此以前，被告鲁冠南违犯中国法律，乘中国进行无产阶级文化大革命的机会，大肆进行间谍活动，曾多次潜入我国党政机关和中共中央文化革命小组接待站等处内部，搜集我国政治、军事情报。鲁冠南还冒充亚非友好国家驻华人员或留学生，窃取我国情报，曾多次被红卫兵和革命群众抓住或赶走。
    公诉书说，被告鲁冠南，长期以来披着外交官外衣进行间谍活动，窃取我国政治、军事情报，严重地危害了我国安全。公诉书要求依照国家法律对间谍分子鲁冠南予以惩办。
    证人、中国人民解放军驻北京部队李文杰接着讲话。他愤怒地揭发了印度驻华大使馆人员从事间谍活动的罪行，介绍了他们六月四日在现场拿获对我军事禁区进行窥测和偷摄禁区照片的鲁冠南和维杰的情况。他说，我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，对于那些进行间谍活动、坚决与中国人民为敌的分子，一定要给予他们应得的惩罚。
    他说，印度反动派长期以来一直追随美帝和苏修对我国采取敌对的态度，充当了反华大合唱的小丑；它在美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的怂恿下，不断在中印边界地区进行挑衅，并公然对我国进行武装侵略；它公开同人民公敌蒋介石匪帮互相勾结，并伙同蒋特分子对我旅印华侨进行残酷的迫害；它豢养着西藏叛匪达赖，妄图卷土重来，让这个奴隶主重新骑在西藏人民的头上，等等。为了维护我国的神圣的领土和主权，我们曾不断地给了印度反动派以坚决的回击和揭露。但是印度反动派贼心不死，正当我国无产阶级文化大革命进入了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战时刻，基于他们的阶级本能，在美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的支持下，利用他们驻华外交人员的合法身份，疯狂地进行搜集、盗窃我国情报的间谍活动，再一次对中国人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    他说，我们严正警告美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，心最红，眼最亮，你们的任何破坏活动都是决不会得逞的，都必将遭到可耻的失败。
    李文杰说，中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的人民军队，我们牢记毛主席的教导，握紧枪杆子，对于那些破坏我国无产阶级文化大革命和危害祖国安全的一切国内外阶级敌人，都要坚决地予以打击，保卫我们祖国神圣领土不受任何侵犯，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    接着，北京市工代会、农代会的代表和红卫兵的代表在公审大会上讲话，他们怀着对阶级敌人的强烈仇恨，对鲁冠南的滔天罪行表示极大的愤慨，要求严惩间谍分子鲁冠南，并向印度驻华大使馆提出最强烈的抗议。他们说：
    “印度反动派长期以来配合美帝和苏修，充当反华小丑，一贯敌视伟大的中国人民。印度驻华大使馆人员从事间谍活动，是印度反动派从事反华罪恶活动的一部分。鲁冠南这个间谍分子被中国人民揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”
    “毛主席教导我们：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对我国轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱，刺探我国的情报，搞间谍活动。我们严厉警告你们：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，眼睛是雪亮的，一切在中国从事间谍活动的牛鬼蛇神决逃不出中国人民的巨掌，你们如果一意孤行，决不会有好下场！”
    “我们红卫兵严正警告鲁冠南这一类间谍分子，我国无产阶级专政下的大民主，是给人民的，对你们，对国内外的一切牛鬼蛇神，一点民主也不给，半点也不给！我们只许你们规规矩矩，老老实实，不许你们乱说乱动！如若不信，请你们尝尝我们红卫兵的铁拳头！我们红卫兵必须有高度的警惕性，我们要把伪装外交官的鲁冠南之类在我国领土上进行非法活动的国际间谍，一个个地揪出来示众！”
    “当前国际阶级斗争是尖锐的，复杂的，敌人时时刻刻都在对我们进行破坏和捣乱，我们要提高革命警惕性，加强国际阶级斗争的观念。要按林彪副主席的教导去做：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。让我们在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把我们的祖国建成社会主义的铁打江山，让它千秋万代永不变色！使帝修反企图在中国复辟的阴谋彻底破产！”
    北京市高级人民法院特别人民法庭审判长，宣读判决书，判决书中历数了间谍分子鲁冠南在我国进行间谍活动的种种罪行后说，鲁冠南窃取我国情报的犯罪活动，有大量罪证在案，不容抵赖。事实充分证明，被告鲁冠南长期以来披着外交官外衣，无视中华人民共和国的国家法律，在中国领土上明目张胆地进行间谍活动，严重地危害了我国的国家安全，必须依法惩处。特别人民法庭特依据中华人民共和国法律，判决被告鲁冠南犯间谍罪，判处驱逐出境，立即执行。罪证照像底片予以没收。判决自即日起立即生效。
    宣读判决书以后，全场响起雷鸣般的掌声，热烈拥护这一严正判决。人们不断地高呼：“无产阶级专政万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“提高革命警惕性，保卫无产阶级文化大革命！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    北京市革命委员会常委兼政法组组长范普权在大会上讲话。他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，宣告了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最后灭亡。世界人民为此欢欣鼓舞，但是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派则怕得要死，恨得要命。他们一方面开动宣传机器，对我国大肆造谣诽谤，另一方面，千方百计地窃取我国的政治、军事、经济情报。他们指使其驻华人员和记者到处乱钻，偷偷摸摸，招摇撞骗，进行了一系列的罪恶勾当。　
    他们利用我国开展无产阶级大民主的机会，到处偷抄、偷摄我革命群众的大字报，不择手段地搜罗窃取我革命组织出版的报刊、传单和各种内部材料，有的甚至冒充同我友好的国家的人员，混入我党政机关、团体、学校、企业单位搜集情报，或者向革命群众刺探我国内部情况。他指出，国际阶级敌人这些疯狂的活动，恰恰说明他们越是临近末日，就越要以十倍的疯狂作垂死的挣扎。
    范普权说，我们革命的人民，红卫兵小将们，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，百倍提高警惕，随时准备粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计，坚决捍卫我国的安全和利益，捍卫无产阶级专政！
    范普权说，中国人民是善于区别敌友的。我们一贯把各国人民同各国反动派区别开来，把同我们友好的国家同帝、修、反区别开来。对于我们的朋友，我们一贯本着无产阶级国际主义精神，热情友好，互相支持，互相帮助。我们积极帮助他们了解我国的无产阶级文化大革命和我国社会主义建设的情况。凡是尊重中国主权，遵守中国政府法令的外国驻华机构和人员，我们一向给予他们工作上的便利。但是，对于那些别有用心的分子，对于那些敢于侵犯我国主权、危害我国安全的间谍分子，不管他们披着什么外衣，我们一定要彻底揭露，坚决打击，决不留情！这就是我们的方针，这就是我们的态度。
    公审大会结束以后，革命群众拍手称快，大家斗志昂扬，表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，提高革命警惕性，严防一切阶级敌人的破坏活动，保卫伟大的无产阶级专政。
    印度驻华大使馆人员无耻地从事间谍活动，激起了各界革命群众的极大愤怒。今天，首都红卫兵小将和各界革命群众，高举着毛主席像，挥动着标语旗，一批一批地涌向印度驻华大使馆门前，张贴标语和大字报，强烈抗议印度驻华大使馆人员在北京从事间谍活动。
    今天上午，印度驻华大使馆的全体中国职工，走出印度大使馆大门，向印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯递交了一份抗议信。中国职工在抗议信中最强烈地谴责印度驻华大使馆人员从事间谍活动的严重罪行。
    在印度驻华大使馆门前，人们愤怒地高呼：“坚决肃清一切帝、修、反在华的间谍分子！”“严惩印度间谍分子鲁冠南！”“打倒印度反动派！打倒美英帝国主义！打倒苏联现代修正主义！”（附图片）
