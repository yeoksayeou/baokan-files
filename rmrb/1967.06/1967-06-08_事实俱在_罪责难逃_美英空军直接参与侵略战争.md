Facts Are Clear: Responsibility Cannot Be Escaped
U.S. and British Air Forces Directly Involved in Aggressive War

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 7th, U.S. imperialism not only supports Israel's armed aggression against Arab countries but also, in collusion with British imperialism, dispatched air forces to directly participate in Israel's aggressive war.

Egyptian President Nasser sent a telegram on the 6th to the leaders of seven Arab countries, including Syria and Iraq, calling for Arab countries to adopt a unified stance to deal with the serious situation caused by the aggression of Arab enemies and condemning U.S. and British imperialism for "conducting military and air interventions to support Israel's aggression."

The Supreme Command of the Egyptian Armed Forces also issued a statement on the 6th, pointing out that it has been fully confirmed that U.S. and British aircraft, based on aircraft carriers, have participated in battles on the Egyptian and Jordanian fronts. According to a report from Cairo's Al-Ahram newspaper on the 7th, the U.S. and Britain have also provided pilots to Israel under the guise of volunteers.

According to Al-Ahram, quoting a well-informed source from the United Nations, U.S. imperialism and Israel have reached an agreement whereby Israel, under the air cover provided by U.S. aircraft carriers, will launch aggressive attacks; if the war develops in a way unfavorable to Israel, the U.S. will intervene with marines based on its guarantee to protect Israel.

Britain has redeployed its navy and decided to dispatch a fast ship commanded by Navy Captain Castles from the Mediterranean to the waters off Aden. At the same time, Britain has also gathered various types of bombers and attack aircraft in Cyprus and the Bahrain Islands, preparing to participate in Israel's aggressive war.

    事实俱在  罪责难逃
    美英空军直接参与侵略战争
    据新华社七日讯　美帝国主义不仅支持以色列对阿拉伯国家发动武装侵略，而且伙同英帝国主义派遣空军直接参与以色列的侵略战争。
    阿联总统纳赛尔六日打电报给叙利亚、伊拉克等七位阿拉伯国家领导人，呼吁阿拉伯国家要采取一致的立场，来对付阿拉伯敌人发动的侵略战争所造成的严重局势，并谴责美英帝国主义“进行军事和空中干涉来支持以色列侵略。”
    阿联武装部队最高司令部也在六日发表声明指出，已经充分证实，以航空母舰为基地的美国和英国飞机在阿联和约旦战线上都参加了战斗。据开罗《金字塔报》七日报道，美国和英国还以志愿人员的名义向以色列提供驾驶员。
    据《金字塔报》援引联合国消息灵通人士的话说，美帝国主义和以色列已达成如下协议，即以色列在美国第六舰队航空母舰提供的空中掩护下，发动侵略攻击；如果战争的发展变得对以色列不利，美国将根据它关于保护以色列的保证，用海军陆战队进行干涉。
    英国已重新部署它的海军，并决定增派由海军中校卡斯尔斯指挥的快速舰由地中海去亚丁海面，同时英国又在塞浦路斯、巴林群岛等地集结有各种类型的轰炸机和攻击机，准备参与以色列发动的侵略战争。
