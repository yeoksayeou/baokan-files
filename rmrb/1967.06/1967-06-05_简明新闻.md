	U.S.-Italy Civil Aviation Agreement Talks Collapse
	The negotiations between the United States and Italy on revising the civil aviation agreement between the two countries, which had been going on for four months, finally collapsed in Washington on May 31 due to the U.S. government's arrogant insistence on unequal terms.

	Statements issued by both sides after the breakdown announced that the original aviation agreement between the two countries was formally abrogated on May 31.

	On the eve of the breakdown of the talks, the head of the Italian delegation participating in the negotiations revealed to the press that if a new civil aviation agreement could not be signed, Italy was prepared to "stop all flights between the two countries to face off with the United States" if necessary.

	U.S. Imperialism Uses Japan for Bacteriological Weapons Research
	In an attempt to salvage its losing war in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is hastening the use of Japanese universities and research institutions to conduct inhuman chemical and bacteriological weapons experiments and research. According to the _Asahi Shimbun_, the U.S. Army Far East Research and Development Laboratory has already provided $1,070,000 in "research funds" to Japanese institutions participating in this work. These institutions include 25 universities, 9 research institutes, 2 academic societies, and 1 hospital in Japan.

	Soviet Revisionists Frantically Pumping Blood into Indian Reactionaries
	Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai said that so far, the Soviet Union has provided India with eight loans totaling 1,253,600,000 rubles. The interest rate is 2.5 percent per annum. By the end of March this year, India had repaid the Soviet Union 120 million rubles in principal and 45.26 million rubles in interest.

	U.S. Imperialism Eases Export Restrictions on Eastern European Countries
	The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on June 2 that it would again ease restrictions on the export of various so-called "non-strategic materials" to Eastern European countries, including dairy products, grains, flour, meat, fertilizers, and oils.

	This is another step by U.S. imperialism to economically infiltrate Eastern Europe and promote the "peaceful evolution" of Eastern European countries.
