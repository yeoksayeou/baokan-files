The great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" scientifically summarizes the experiences and lessons of the world proletarian revolutionary movement, and brilliantly develops the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism, class struggle, and proletarian dictatorship theory. It is a programmatic document guiding the proletariat to carry the socialist revolution to the end after seizing power.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this great work is the most powerful weapon guiding us to see the big picture, distinguish between friends and enemies, unite the majority, mobilize all positive factors, and strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Political Department of the Air Force Cultural Troupe, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao in this work, have studied, practiced, and summarized in the struggle. With the standpoint of class struggle and the method of class analysis, we strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and have launched a resolute struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At the same time, we have launched a powerful political offensive, through patient and meticulous political and ideological work, to win over, educate, and unite the majority of the deceived masses in the conservative organizations, achieving revolutionary unity, and seizing the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. According to the revolutionary principle of "three-in-one combination," we have established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative revolutionary committee of the proletariat. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our troupe is advancing victoriously along the course opened by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. The contradiction between the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and us is an antagonistic contradiction, while the contradiction between the more than ninety-five percent of the masses and cadres and us is a contradiction among the people. These are two types of contradictions of different nature.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres must firmly remember what the "Sixteen Points" point out, "The focus of this movement is to criticize those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road," "Do not turn contradictions among the people into antagonistic contradictions, and do not turn antagonistic contradictions into contradictions among the people." Those deceived masses, although they have taken the wrong side and done wrong things in the Cultural Revolution, are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We are persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, and they are poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line. We must not direct the spearhead of the struggle at them or use the methods of dealing with enemies to deal with them. We must follow the principle of revolution without distinction of the first and the last, understand them, cherish them, care for them, and patiently help them return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only in this way can we achieve revolutionary unity and form an iron fist to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

To fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and at the same time achieve the goal of educating the deceived masses, we must present facts, reason, insist on political struggle, and oppose physical struggle. We are proletarian revolutionary cadres, and the truth is in our hands. Political struggle can completely defeat the enemy. To present facts and reason, we must master the factual materials and do a large amount of painstaking investigation and research work. During the days when the bourgeois reactionary line persecuted us, the young rebels of the revolutionary rebel corps, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, often had to struggle, break through the siege, shake off the tail, brave the cold wind, go hungry, and walk tens of miles back and forth to conduct detailed investigations and research, mastering the criminal facts of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary rebel corps used a large amount of facts to expose their anti-Party crimes, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were at a loss. Many deceived masses awakened, saw the big picture, and withdrew from the conservative organizations.

In just one month, our revolutionary rebel corps of only about twenty people, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, insisted on the method of presenting facts and reasoning, launched a political offensive combining big-character posters and individual talks, exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, won over, educated, and united the majority of the deceived masses, and expanded and strengthened the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary cadres.

In the work of winning over, educating, and uniting the deceived masses, the proletarian revolutionary cadres must first solve the attitude problem and start from the desire for unity.

Due to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road pushing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number," inciting the masses to fight the masses and the masses to fight the cadres, a serious confrontation has been created among the masses. We proletarian revolutionary cadres, who have fought our way out of the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line and have also taken the upper hand in politics and organization, can we approach those deceived masses who have attacked and besieged us with a comradely attitude, actively help them, unite them, and help them quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? This is a serious test for the proletarian revolutionary cadres.

When solving this attitude problem, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and put the overall situation first, absolutely not calculating personal grievances.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not only unite with those who agree with us but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us. We must also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." There is a party branch committee member in the orchestra who was once attacked and struggled against by some deceived masses. Later, the proletarian revolutionary cadres seized power, and he was elected as a member of the revolutionary committee. At this time, some comrades who had participated in the attack on him did not dare to meet him. This party branch committee member understood that as a true proletarian revolutionary cadre, he must not start from personal grievances to deal with those comrades. He actively sought out those comrades for heart-to-heart talks, quickly eliminated emotional barriers, and opened up the situation for unity.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." We must not replace policy with emotion when dealing with the deceived masses.

After seizing power, some comrades had hostile feelings towards those deceived masses who had attacked them, saying: "In the past, you struggled against me, and today I can struggle against you, but there is no place for you in the revolutionary unity." "Our unit is special, and we cannot unite ninety-five percent." In response to these active thoughts, we conducted a rectification campaign and seriously studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Everyone realized that achieving revolutionary unity is mainly the responsibility of the proletarian revolutionary cadres. We must not replace policy with emotion and must not retaliate against class brothers. If we only think about venting our own anger and do not go to win over, educate, and unite the deceived masses, we will push our comrades to the enemy's side, and this will fall into the trap of the class enemy. Through study, we proletarian revolutionary cadres have improved our policy level, put revolution first, put the overall situation first, and firmly act according to the Party's policy. Many comrades who have come out of the conservative organizations said: "I have been observing how you implement the policy towards us, whether it is true unity or false unity. Looking and looking, you are truly acting according to the Party's policy, and you are proletarian revolutionary cadres."

The practice of struggle tells us that for any matter, we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and act according to the Party's policy. For Chairman Mao's instructions, we must firmly execute those we understand, and we must also firmly execute those we do not yet understand, gradually understanding them in the process of execution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All issues of an ideological nature and all issues of debate among the people can only be resolved through democratic methods, only through the methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not through coercion and suppression." To win over, educate, and unite the deceived masses, we must insist on the four firsts and do meticulous political and ideological work, patiently helping them.

To do political and ideological work, we must be good at grasping active thoughts and treating them symptomatically. Some deceived masses have heavy ideological burdens, especially some older comrades, who feel that they have been educated by the Party for many years, and in this critical moment of the Cultural Revolution, they have taken the wrong side, feeling guilty towards the Party, not daring to go out, and not daring to see comrades. These comrades feel this way because they have already realized their mistakes, feeling the burden and pressure. At this time, we must not let them do any "self-reflection" or allow them to do any "confession," but encourage them to change direction and actively join the battle, educating themselves in the struggle. In this way, these comrades quickly shed their burdens and turn against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

After the collapse of the conservative organization in our troupe, some masses still could not turn around for a long time. Although they have left the conservative organization, they still have a barrier with the proletarian revolutionary cadres. In response to this situation, we carefully studied, found the root of the problem, and untied the ideological knots of these comrades. A comrade, after withdrawing from the conservative organization, had a bad mood, neither contacting the conservative organization nor communicating with the revolutionary rebel corps. This comrade wanted to actively participate in the movement during the Cultural Revolution but, due to low political and ideological level and lack of class standpoint, participated in the conservative organization. After the conservative organization collapsed, he was still not convinced of the comrades who joined the revolutionary organization. In response to this ideological situation, we patiently helped him see clearly the evil deeds done by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road through the conservative organization, and then inspired him to recall bitterness and sweetness, helping this comrade who was originally a cowherd to quickly raise his awareness and change his stance.

The work of uniting the masses and winning over the masses will often have setbacks. Some comrades, who originally agreed with our views, joined the conservative organization after they seized power. The revolutionary rebel corps came out, and they leaned towards the revolutionary rebel corps but later leaned towards the conservative organization. Some of our comrades were disgusted with such people, thinking they were opportunists, weathercocks, and untrustworthy. After studying, we believe that the reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted. When the proletarian revolutionary cadres rise up, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road still want to continue to deceive the masses of the conservative organization to protect themselves. They spread rumors and create chaos, increasing the hostility of the deceived masses towards us. Some people fell into the trap of the bad guys, or due to their own selfish motives, began to waver. Among them, opportunists are only a very small number, and the vast majority of comrades are still a matter of understanding. For such comrades, we should more enthusiastically approach them, expose the tricks of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, help them identify the enemy, and draw a clear line with that handful. When they have not yet awakened, we should patiently wait. The practice has proven that as long as we sincerely help them, they will learn from the struggle, clarify the direction, and ultimately stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao said: "Organizing tens of thousands and millions of people, mobilizing a surging revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a mass revolutionary movement, and only by mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses can we successfully carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. For those who have been deceived and have corrected their mistakes or are correcting their mistakes, we trust them politically, boldly use them, give them work, and give them tasks. Some have even taken on the role of sub-team leadership groups. Currently, many comrades who have come out of the conservative organizations are playing a good role in the struggle.

We deeply understand that in this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every victory we have achieved is a victory of the great, invincible, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we deeply feel that the victories we have achieved so far are only the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march, and the work ahead will be even more arduous. We have not yet studied Chairman Mao's works well, and we have not yet worked hard enough on the "use" aspect. In the work of winning over, educating, and uniting the deceived masses, we still have many shortcomings. Today, on the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," we are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, correctly handle contradictions among the people, further unite the majority, closely combine the great criticism of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾正确对待受蒙蔽的群众
    中国人民解放军空军政治部文工团革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，科学地总结了世界无产阶级革命运动的经验和教训，天才地发展了马克思列宁主义的唯物辩证法、阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说。它是指导无产阶级在夺取政权以后，将社会主义革命进行到底的纲领性文件。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这篇伟大的著作，是指导我们认清大方向，辨别敌友我，团结大多数，调动一切积极因素，打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的最强有力的武器。
    我们空军政治部文工团的无产阶级革命派，遵循伟大领袖毛主席在这篇著作中的教导，在斗争中边学习，边实践，边总结，以阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析的方法，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了坚决的斗争。同时，发动强大的政治攻势，通过耐心细致的政治思想工作，争取、教育和团结了保守组织的大多数受蒙蔽的群众，实现了革命的大联合，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺回了党、政、财、文大权，按照革命的“三结合”的原则，建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的革命委员会。目前，我团的无产阶级文化大革命，正沿着毛主席开辟的航道胜利前进。			一
    毛主席教导我们：谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。
    无产阶级文化大革命是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的一场大决战。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派同我们之间的矛盾是敌我矛盾，而占百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，是我们的同志和朋友。保守组织受蒙蔽的广大群众同我们之间的矛盾，属于人民内部矛盾。这是两类不同性质的矛盾。
    无产阶级革命派必须牢记十六条中指出的，“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”，“不要把人民内部矛盾搞成敌我矛盾，也不要把敌我矛盾当成人民内部矛盾”。那些受蒙蔽的群众，虽然在文化大革命运动中，站错了队，做了错事，但他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。我们是受资产阶级反动路线的迫害，他们是受资产阶级反动路线的毒害。我们决不能把斗争的矛头指向他们，用对付敌人的方法去对付他们。我们要按照革命不分先后的原则，体谅他们，爱护他们，关心他们，耐心地帮助他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。只有这样，才能实现革命的大联合，形成一个钢铁的拳头，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    要斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同时达到教育受蒙蔽群众的目的，必须摆事实，讲道理，坚持文斗，反对武斗。我们是无产阶级革命派，真理掌握在我们手里，文斗是完全可以制胜敌人的。要摆事实、讲道理，就必须掌握事实材料，必须做大量的、艰苦的调查研究工作。在资产阶级反动路线对我们进行迫害的日子里，革命造反队的小将们，怀着无限热爱毛主席的红心，常常要经过斗争，冲破围攻，摆脱盯梢，冒着寒风，饿着肚子，徒步往返几十里路，进行细致的调查研究，掌握了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶事实。革命造反队用大量的事实，揭发他们的反党罪行之后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派慌了手脚。许多受蒙蔽的群众觉悟了，他们看清了大方向，退出了保守组织。
    在短短一个月的时间内，我们仅有二十余人的革命造反队，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，坚持摆事实、讲道理的方法，发动了大字报和个别交谈相结合的政治攻势，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，争取、教育和团结了大多数受蒙蔽的群众，发展壮大了无产阶级革命派的队伍。			二
    无产阶级革命派在争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽群众的工作中，首先要解决态度问题，要从团结的愿望出发。
    由于我团内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，群众斗干部，造成了群众之间的严重对立。我们无产阶级革命派，从资产阶级反动路线的迫害中冲杀出来，并且，在政治上、组织上占了优势之后，对那些曾经打击、围攻过自己的受蒙蔽的群众，能不能用同志式的态度，主动地去接近他们，帮助他们，团结他们，使他们尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，这是对无产阶级革命派的一个严重考验。
    在解决这个态度问题的时候，我们必须遵循毛主席的教导，要以大局为重，绝对不能计较个人恩怨。
    毛主席教导我们：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”乐队有一个党支部委员，曾经被一些受蒙蔽的群众围攻、斗争。后来，无产阶级革命派夺回了大权，他当选为革命委员会的委员。这时，一些参加过围攻他的同志，不好意思和他见面。这个党支部委员懂得，作为一个真正的无产阶级革命派，决不能从个人恩怨出发去对待那些同志。他主动去找那些同志谈心，很快地消除了感情上的隔阂，打开了团结的局面。
    毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命”。我们对待受蒙蔽的群众，绝不能以感情代替政策。
    我们夺权之后，有的同志对那些打击过自己的受蒙蔽的群众有对立情绪，说：“过去你斗我，今天我可以不斗你，但是，革命大联合没你的份。”“我们单位特殊，团结不了百分之九十五。”针对这些活思想，我们通过整风，认真学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。大家认识到，实现革命的大联合，主要责任在我们无产阶级革命派肩上。我们决不能以感情代替政策，决不能对阶级兄弟以牙还牙。如果只想自己出气，而不去争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众，就会把自己的同志推到敌人方面去，这就上了阶级敌人的当。通过学习，我们无产阶级革命派提高了政策水平，以革命为怀，以大局为重，坚决按党的政策办事。许多从保守组织中退出来的同志说：“我一直在观察你们对我们实行什么政策，是真联合还是假联合。看来看去，你们是真正按党的政策办事，是无产阶级革命派。”
    斗争的实践告诉我们，对任何一件事情，都必须按照毛主席的指示办，按照党的政策办。对毛主席的指示，理解了的要坚决执行，暂时还没有理解的，也要坚决执行，在执行的过程中去逐步理解。			三
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众，一定要坚持四个第一，进行细致的政治思想工作，耐心地帮助他们。
    进行政治思想工作，要善于抓活思想，对症下药。一部分受蒙蔽的群众，思想包袱很重，尤其是一些比较老的同志，觉得自己受党教育多年，在这次文化大革命的关键时刻，站错了队，感到对不起党，抬不起头来，不愿出门，不愿见同志。这些同志之所以这样，是因为他们已经认识到自己错了，才感到有包袱，有压力。在这种时候，绝不能要他们搞什么“闭门思过”，更绝不能允许要他们搞什么“请罪”，而要鼓励他们扭转方向，积极投入战斗，在斗争中自己教育自己。这样，这些同志就很快地卸掉包袱，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派反戈一击。
    我团的保守组织垮台之后，还有一部分群众迟迟转不过弯来，他们虽然脱离了保守组织，可是，同无产阶级革命派还有隔阂。针对这种情况，我们仔细地进行了研究，找出了问题的症结所在，解开了这些同志的思想疙瘩。有个同志，退出保守组织之后，情绪不太好，既不和保守组织联系，也不和革命造反队串连。这个同志在文化大革命中，一直想积极参加运动，只是由于政治思想水平不高，缺乏阶级观点，这次参加了保守组织。保守组织垮台之后，对参加革命组织的同志还有些不服气。针对这个思想情况，我们耐心地帮助他看清了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派利用保守组织所干的坏事，进而启发他忆苦思甜，帮助这个放牛娃出身的同志很快地提高了觉悟，改变了立场。
    团结群众、争取群众的工作，也常常会有反复。有的同志，本来和我们观点一致，保守组织夺权以后，他们参加了保守组织。革命造反队杀出来了，他们又靠拢革命造反队，但后来又倒向了保守组织。我们的一些同志对这样的人很反感，认为他们是投机，是随风倒，是不可信任的。经过研究，我们认为造成这种现象的原因是多方面的。当无产阶级革命派起来之后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派还想继续蒙蔽保守组织的群众来保他们自己。他们散布谣言、制造混乱，增加受蒙蔽群众同我们的对立情绪。有的人上了坏人的当，或者由于自己的私心杂念作怪，便左右摇摆起来。在他们中间，投机的人只是极个别的，绝大多数同志仍然是认识问题。对这样的同志，我们应当更加热情地去接近他们，揭穿党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋诡计，帮助他们认准敌人，同那一小撮划清界限。在他们还没有觉悟过来的时候，我们应当耐心等待。事实证明，只要我们真心帮助他们，他们就会在斗争中吸取教训，辨明方向，最终站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来的。
    毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”无产阶级文化大革命是群众性的革命运动，只有调动广大群众的革命积极性，才能胜利地将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。对那些受了蒙蔽而又改正了错误或正在改正错误的同志，我们在政治上信任他们，大胆地使用，给工作，给任务，有的还担任了分团领导小组的成员。目前，有许多从保守组织退出来的同志，在斗争中很好地发挥了自己的作用。
    我们深深地懂得，在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们所取得的每一个胜利，都是伟大的、战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想的胜利。同时，我们也深深地感到，目前我们所取得的胜利，不过是万里长征走完了第一步，往后的工作还将更加艰苦。我们对毛主席著作学得还不好，在“用”字上狠下功夫还很不够。我们在争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众的工作中还存在不少缺点。今天，在纪念毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年的时候，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步活学活用毛主席这篇光辉著作，遵循毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确处理人民内部矛盾，进一步团结大多数，把对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
