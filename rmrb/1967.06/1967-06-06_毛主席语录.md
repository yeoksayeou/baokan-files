	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line. Art for art's sake, art that is above classes, and art that is apolitical or politically neutral, do not exist in fact. Literature and art of the proletariat are a component part of the whole revolutionary cause of the proletariat, just as Lenin said, they are "cogs and wheels" in the whole revolutionary machine.

    毛主席语录
    在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的“齿轮和螺丝钉”。
