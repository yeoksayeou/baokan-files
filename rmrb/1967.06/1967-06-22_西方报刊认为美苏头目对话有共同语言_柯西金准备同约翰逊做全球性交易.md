Western bourgeois newspapers, in commenting on the speech made by the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin at the UN on the 19th, believe that Kosygin's speech indicates that the Soviet revisionist leadership is prepared to engage in global deals with U.S. imperialism.

The British newspaper *The Guardian* published an article on the 20th titled "The Kremlin is Ready to Make a Deal." The article states that although Kosygin "did not lack words of condemnation for Israel's 'atrocities' and 'aggression,'" his attitude towards the U.S. and Britain was "notably mild" and "restrained." "This means that Mr. Kosygin wants to make a deal with the West, and therefore he carefully avoids confrontation with the Western leaders."

*The Guardian* said that in this regard, Kosygin "has done his best, even at the risk of further offending the Arabs." The newspaper revealed some aspects of Kosygin's alignment with Johnson on the Middle East issue: they both acknowledge the "right to exist" of the U.S.-sponsored aggressor Israel; Johnson, in order to deprive Arab countries of the right to self-defense, once mentioned the need to avoid an "arms race" in the Middle East, while Kosygin "made the same point on this issue, indicating that" the Soviet Union might eventually be willing to participate in an arms embargo on the Middle East; Johnson wants to force Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions through negotiations, and Kosygin "has not closed the door on negotiations anywhere, and during the negotiations, (the withdrawal of Israeli aggressors) and the resolution of other issues can be combined into a package deal."

The editorial in *The Times* of London on the 20th said that Kosygin emphasized that the great powers should find "common ground," and his speech touched on many regions—Cuba, Germany, the Congo. "He raised these regional issues, which may indicate that if he wants to negotiate with the Americans, it would involve all issues, not just the Middle East."

The French newspaper *Le Figaro* said, "After making the expected condemnation of Israel, Kosygin told the United Nations: the great powers should find common ground to achieve a peaceful resolution."

The Swiss newspaper *La Tribune de Lausanne* also said that Johnson and Kosygin's speeches had a "common basis," and both parties placed the Middle East issue in a global context. Johnson and Kosygin "both mentioned Vietnam, Europe, the primary responsibilities of the great powers, and their readiness to cooperate."

### 西方报刊认为美苏头目对话有共同语言  柯西金准备同约翰逊做全球性交易

    西方报刊认为美苏头目对话有共同语言
    柯西金准备同约翰逊做全球性交易
    新华社二十一日讯  英国和法国资产阶级报纸在评论苏修头目柯西金十九日在联大讲话时认为，柯西金这个讲话表明，苏修领导集团准备同美帝国主义进行全球性交易。
    英国《卫报》二十日发表题目是《克里姆林宫准备做交易》的一篇评论说，虽然柯西金“在讲话中不乏指责以色列犯了‘暴行’和进行‘侵略’的词句”，可是他对美英的态度“突出温和”、“克制”。“这就意味着，柯西金先生想同西方做交易，因此小心地避免同西方的领导人造成对立。”
    《卫报》说，在这方面，柯西金“尽了他的力量，甚至不惜以进一步得罪阿拉伯人的代价这样做”。这家报纸透露了柯西金同约翰逊在中东问题上亦步亦趋的一些方面：他们都承认美帝侵略工具以色列的“生存权利”；约翰逊为了剥夺阿拉伯国家反侵略自卫武装的权利，曾讲到需要在中东避免“军备竞赛”，而柯西金“在这个问题上提出了同样的论点表明”，“苏联可能最后乐意参加对中东实行军火禁运”；约翰逊要通过谈判来迫使阿拉伯国家接受屈辱条件，而柯西金“没有在任何地方封住谈判的道路，在谈判过程中，（以色列侵略者）撤军和其他问题的解决可以结合在一起而成一笔一揽子交易。”
    英国《泰晤士报》二十日的社论说，柯西金强调大国要找到“共同语言”，“他的讲话中涉及了许多地区——古巴、德国、刚果”，“他提出这些地区的问题很可能是表示，如果他要同美国人谈判，那就要涉及一切问题，而不单单是中东问题。”
    法国《费加罗报》说，“柯西金在作了如所预料对以色列的一番谴责以后，告诉联合国：大国应该找到共同语言来达成和平解决。”
    瑞士《洛桑日报》也说，约翰逊和柯西金的讲话有着“共同的基础”，“双方都把中东问题放在全球背景上”，约翰逊和柯西金“都讲到越南、欧洲，大国的首要责任以及准备进行合作”。
