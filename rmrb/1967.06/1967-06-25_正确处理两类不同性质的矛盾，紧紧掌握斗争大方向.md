The brilliant work of our great leader Chairman Mao, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," is like a lighthouse guiding our forward path; it is like a bright lamp illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, we in the PLA Navy Headquarters have successfully launched the Cultural Revolution. In this struggle, under the direct leadership of the Navy Party Committee and revolutionary cadres, we have expanded the ranks of the leftists and gradually united the majority of cadres and the masses, forming a mighty army of cultural revolutionaries. We have severely struck down a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This is another great victory of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!

From the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, we deeply feel the truth that Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out: the fundamental issue in the struggle between the two classes and the two roads is the issue of power. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and ensure that the ironclad mountains of the proletariat will never change color, we must grasp and apply Chairman Mao's great theory on correctly handling the two types of contradictions, distinguish between friends and enemies, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct the spearhead against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Using the great theory of correctly handling the two types of contradictions to grasp the main contradiction and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In front of us, there are two types of social contradictions: the contradictions between the enemy and us, and the contradictions among the people. These are two types of contradictions with completely different natures." "To correctly recognize the two types of different contradictions between the enemy and us and among the people, we must first clarify what is the people and what is the enemy." Chairman Mao tells us: "All social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are the enemies of the people." Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, who is our main enemy? Chairman Mao teaches us that the main target of the revolution is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are the agents of the domestic and foreign class enemies within the Party. Their contradictions with the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are the main contradictions, antagonistic contradictions, and contradictions between the enemy and us.

Whether or not one acknowledges that the contradiction between the proletariat and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the main contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must solve, and whether or not one dares to always direct the spearhead of the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, is a prominent mark distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones.

We have felt that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from beginning to end, it is not an easy task to clearly recognize that the contradiction between the proletariat and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the main contradiction, and in practice, to truly grasp this main contradiction. The process of grasping this main contradiction is actually the process of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. At the same time, it is the process of grasping and applying Chairman Mao's great theory on correctly handling the two types of contradictions.

When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution just began, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party Navy were buried, and to protect themselves, they stubbornly pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, confusing the two types of different contradictions, and vigorously advocated the theory of the "special" nature of the army and the theory of the extinction of class struggle, misleading some of the masses and thus blurring the main contradiction. Facing this situation, we studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's instruction cleared the fog for us, brightened our eyes, and cleared our minds, making us realize that class struggle also exists within the army and that there are capitalist-roaders within the army. A handful of capitalist-roaders buried within the army are the most dangerous time bombs.

How to identify these handful of enemies? Chairman Mao pointed out that the method of class analysis is the most fundamental method for understanding the situation and analyzing friends and enemies. Vice Chairman Lin said: Class and class struggle are the total source of social phenomena in class society. If we observe social phenomena without this total source, we will confuse things, invert right and wrong, and make mistakes in observation. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, we analyzed a large number of phenomena in real life and gradually understood that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are a handful of revisionists who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. To identify these people, we cannot look at their qualifications or positions, nor can we look at their origins. We must distinguish whether they are people of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters or the bourgeois headquarters, and whether they support or oppose Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Based on this understanding, we further analyzed many phenomena in the Cultural Revolution of the Navy Headquarters: Why were revolutionary leftist cadres who had always held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought suppressed, while a few bad people could run rampant? Why were the revolutionary big-character posters of the masses attacked? Why did some people say that our unit did not have a reactionary line as soon as the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line began? All these questions aroused our deep thoughts and made us realize that there is also a struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines here. Based on a large amount of conclusive evidence, we gradually exposed the true face of a handful of capitalist-roaders hidden within the Navy. Under the wise leadership and personal guidance of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, in the revolutionary high tide of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, we revolutionary communists broke through numerous obstacles and finally exposed the deeply hidden handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

After the bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated into the Party were exposed, should the revolutionary communists continue to direct the spearhead of the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party?

Some people think that after the bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated into the Party were exposed, the contradiction between the enemy and us has been basically resolved, and the enemy has become a "dead tiger." Dealing with their problems is just a "case," and there is no need to continue to mobilize troops to engage in a head-on struggle with them. We believe that this view is wrong. Exposing a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party does not mean the end of the struggle between the enemy and us, but rather marks the beginning of a new stage in the struggle between the enemy and us. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must not relax our vigilance." The facts are exactly like this. The exposed handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They have repeatedly counterattacked, trying to regain their lost "paradise." They are not "dead tigers." Only by thoroughly defeating, overthrowing, and exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and by thoroughly uprooting their black line and eliminating their influence, can we prevent the restoration of capitalism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. A true revolutionary communist must have the spirit of beating a fallen dog and be willing to work hard in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is a concrete manifestation of our unlimited love for Chairman Mao and our high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people. Those who think that "there is no oil in beating a dead tiger" and that "the enemy has been defeated, and the contradiction between the enemy and us has become secondary," and therefore do not want to sit down and do meticulous and painstaking criticism work, but are eager to engage in "internal warfare," running around and visiting everywhere, and neglecting the important enemy, are completely wrong. This will divert the direction of the struggle and only make the enemy happy.

Experience tells us: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the contradiction between the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is always the main contradiction. The main method to resolve this contradiction is to carry out the "four greats," that is, great criticism and great struggle. Revolutionary communists must firmly grasp this main contradiction, grasp the line of great criticism, and unshakably direct the spearhead of the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Using the great theory of correctly handling the two types of contradictions to strictly distinguish between the two types of leaders and the two headquarters

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, using the method of class analysis to correctly distinguish and deal with proletarian leaders and capitalist-roaders, and the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, is a very important issue related to whether the direction of the struggle can be correctly grasped.

Chairman Mao teaches us to strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, adopt different attitudes and methods, and correctly deal with the two types of different contradictions. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party deliberately confuse the boundaries between proletarian leaders and bourgeois leaders, and between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, inciting the masses to divert the direction of the struggle. We are in sharp opposition to them, firmly defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. For revolutionary leftist leaders who have been highly praised by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and who have been tested through long-term struggle, we unite with them and fight together, and firmly support their leadership, supporting them in seizing power and using power for the proletariat, and firmly establishing the revolutionary authority of the proletariat. We believe that this is in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on distinguishing between the two types of different contradictions, in accordance with the needs of the development of the Cultural Revolution, in accordance with the fundamental interests of the Party and the people, and is the duty of revolutionary communists.

However, when we defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and unite with revolutionary leftist leaders, we encounter strong opposition from some people. They slander us as "tools of the authorities." We say that in a class society, any social organization and political faction are tools of class struggle and political struggle. The question is whether to be a tool of the proletariat or a tool of the bourgeoisie. There is no such thing as a classless organization or faction. We are not tools of the bourgeois headquarters, but firmly smash it to pieces. We openly declare that we are willing to be tools of the proletariat, tools of the dictatorship of the proletariat, tools of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and tools of defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We feel honored to be such tools.

Some people who oppose us also slander us as "ironclad conservatives." We refute such slander. Chairman Mao once pointed out: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Love and hatred are class-based. In our organization, there are bourgeois leaders and proletarian leaders; there are good cadres and bad cadres. Cadres cannot be judged without distinguishing between good and bad. There is love, there is hatred; there is revolution, there is conservation. How can there be only love without hatred, or only hatred without love? How can there be only revolution without conservation, or only conservation without revolution? For bourgeois leaders and bad cadres, we must hate them, oppose them, and oppose them to the end without mercy. But for proletarian leaders and good cadres, and relatively good cadres, and revolutionary leading cadres, we not only do not hate them, but love them; not only do not oppose them, but support them. They have shortcomings, and we also criticize them. We love them and support them, which does not mean indulging and shielding their shortcomings. However, this criticism is carried out according to the method of handling contradictions among the people. This is completely different from the individual malicious people who want to "burn, seize, and overthrow" them, and put them to death. Those individuals who were instigated by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and went from "overthrowing everything and denying everything" to the road of attacking the proletarian headquarters, if they insist on their mistakes and do not turn back, they are likely to become loyal servants of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, genuine conservatives.

Some people who oppose us also slander us as the "nodding revolutionary faction" and "new slavery." We say that these hats do not fit us. We have never been submissive and subservient to the so-called leadership of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. On the contrary, we dare to struggle and dare to rebel against them. Many comrades in our ranks have struggled against them at the risk of being labeled as counter-revolutionaries. However, for the people in the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, for the proletarian leaders, we must maintain their prestige and obey their correct leadership. We want proletarian democratic centralism, not bourgeois liberalization and anarchism. Chairman Mao teaches us: In the people's internal affairs, democracy and centralism are united, freedom and discipline are united. "This freedom is a freedom under leadership, this democracy is a democracy under centralized guidance, not an anarchic state. An anarchic state does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people." We must consciously obey and defend the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, consciously obey and defend the discipline of the Party and the army, and consciously accept the correct leadership of revolutionary leading cadres. This is not the "nodding revolutionary faction" or "new slavery," but the organizational discipline that a revolutionary communist should have.

True revolutionary communists do not hide their political views. We believe that the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly smash the bourgeois black headquarters, defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whether or not one dares to firmly smash the bourgeois black headquarters, whether or not one dares to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, whether or not one dares to firmly struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and whether or not one dares to enthusiastically support and defend the correct leadership of revolutionary leading cadres, is a major mark distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones, Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought armed fighters from shameful opportunists, and is a severe test for revolutionary communists.

Using the great theory of correctly handling the two types of contradictions to correctly deal with cadres who have made mistakes and the masses who have been deceived

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To mobilize all positive factors, unite all possible people, and as far as possible turn negative factors into positive factors, to serve the great cause of building a socialist society." He also said: We must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tells us: To always grasp the direction of the struggle, unite all possible people to fight against the enemy, and severely strike down a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must correctly deal with cadres who have made mistakes and the masses who have been deceived.

The People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. The vast majority of our cadres are good and relatively good. Many of our old cadres have been cultivated and educated by Chairman Mao for a long time and have been tempered and tested through long-term revolutionary wars. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and are the backbone of the construction of the army. The handful of degenerate elements who have infiltrated into our cadre ranks are only "a few." However, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have reversed right and wrong, confused black and white, and vigorously pushed the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," maliciously spreading the reactionary fallacies of doubting everything, denying everything, and "everyone has a share of the mistake." Under the direct influence of their reactionary line and reactionary ideology, some of our units, for a period of time, did not distinguish between right and wrong and made all cadres stand aside. As a result, the "few" who should have been struck down were protected, providing them with "air-raid shelters," allowing them to fish in troubled waters and stir up trouble. The practice of struggle has made us deeply understand: Whether or not to unite the majority while striking down a few is actually a fundamental issue of distinguishing between friends and enemies. Without actively uniting the majority, one cannot truly isolate a few, but will let the enemy escape. We realized this and quickly took up the work of uniting and winning over the majority of cadres, quickly forming a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and putting a handful of class enemies in a situation of being surrounded on all sides and beaten everywhere.

Chairman Mao said: "We must always remember to draw a clear line between these two boundaries when looking at problems: the boundary between revolution and counter-revolution, and the boundary between achievements and shortcomings. Remembering these two boundaries, things will be easy to handle, otherwise, the nature of the problem will be confused." Some people also draw lines, but they only distinguish between "leaders" and "masses," or above and below a certain level, without class analysis and without talking about line struggle, resulting in the confusion of the two types of contradictions. From the facts of a large number of struggles, we see that in the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines, everyone is consciously or unconsciously taking sides, either standing on the side of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line, or standing on the side of the bourgeois headquarters and the bourgeois reactionary line. Based on this fact, we took Vice Chairman Lin's three criteria for cadres as the basis, and conducted a class analysis of the cadre ranks, realizing that true bad people are only a few, good people are the majority, and a part of those who are half good and half bad and have made mistakes in the struggle can still be won over and saved. Based on this analysis, we took striking down a few bad people and uniting a few good people, and saving a few half good and half bad people as important indicators of whether Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is implemented, and as important indicators of the size of the achievements of struggle, criticism, and transformation in a unit.

Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that we should adopt an analytical attitude towards any problem and not deny everything, we paid attention to distinguishing between a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those who have made mistakes due to work relations; between those who have always been anti-Party and anti-socialist and those who have said or done wrong things at a certain time; between those who have infiltrated into the cadre ranks to engage in conspiratorial restoration activities and those who have stood on the wrong side in the great struggle between the two headquarters at a certain time. In the specific analysis of each person's problem, we paid attention to looking at both minor and major issues, but mainly at major issues; looking at both a specific time and a specific matter, but mainly at their overall performance. As a result, under the premise of not letting the bad people go, we minimized the scope of the strike to the lowest limit.

For cadres who have made mistakes, we took Chairman Mao's teaching of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the person" as our guideline. On the one hand, we enthusiastically unite and save them, do patient and meticulous ideological work for them, and actively help them "come out," and do not adopt the attitude of dealing with the enemy to hold on to them. On the other hand, we seriously expose and criticize their mistakes, go through the struggle, clarify right and wrong, and make them truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, without showing mercy and without "muddling through." In this way, we promote cadres who have made mistakes to gradually recognize and correct their mistakes in the fiery struggle against the enemy, in the serious self-criticism and criticism, and under the care and supervision of the masses, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Whether or not to correctly handle the contradictions among the masses, unite all possible masses, and jointly fight against the enemy, is also an important issue related to whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can achieve final victory.

The vast majority of our masses are daring to revolutionize and dare to struggle. However, due to different levels of awareness, some people showed some conservative ideas at the beginning; a very small number of people, under the deception of the bourgeois reactionary line, maliciously attacked revolutionary leftist leaders and revolutionary rebels.

We revolutionary rebels stand on the revolutionary position of the proletariat, follow Chairman Mao's teaching on correctly handling the two types of different contradictions, and strictly distinguish between friends and enemies. We have a different view of the contradictions between revolution and conservation among the masses from the conservatives. On the one hand, we believe that the contradictions between revolution and conservation among the masses, as a specific reflection of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, are antagonistic and irreconcilable; but on the other hand, we also believe that the vast majority of conservatives are still revolutionary, they are just temporarily deceived and stood on the wrong side, and their contradictions with us are generally still contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao warned us: "Many people cannot distinguish between the two types of different contradictions between the enemy and us and among the people, and easily confuse them." We always strictly distinguish between the contradictions with the deceived masses and the contradictions with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and never allow the two types of different contradictions to be confused, and never allow the spearhead of the struggle to be directed at the masses.

To help the deceived masses quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism or struggle, clarifying right and wrong, and achieving new unity on a new basis," and used the "democratic, that is, persuasive method" to do a large amount of ideological work for the deceived masses. We focused on helping them study and apply Chairman Mao's works, making them truly distinguish themselves from those wrong things in their minds, and summarize their experiences and lessons. The result of our strict distinction between the two types of contradictions and correct handling of the two types of contradictions is that we quickly eliminated the estrangement of the deceived masses towards us, and in the revolutionary great criticism, gradually achieved revolutionary great unity, maximally isolated a handful of enemies, and greatly promoted the revolutionary great criticism and great struggle.

Through the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, we are even more convinced of the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and even more convinced that following Chairman Mao's instructions is victory. With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we fear nothing and can "dare to be skinned alive and dare to pull the emperor off his horse." With Mao Zedong Thought as our support, we can stand tall and unyielding, and dare to brave the twelve-level typhoon, the mountain of knives, and the sea of fire. With Mao Zedong Thought as our navigation, we can avoid getting lost and "seasick" in any stormy waves and misty fog. Looking back at the past year's battle journey, we love our great leader Chairman Mao even more, and love the great Mao Zedong Thought even more. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever advance along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争大方向	中国人民解放军海军直属机关　红联总
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，象一座灯塔，指引着我们前进的航向；象一盏明灯，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的前进道路。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，在毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的领导下，我们海军直属机关胜利地开展了文化大革命。在这场斗争中，我们在海军党委和革命领导干部的直接领导下，壮大了左派队伍，并逐步团结了干部的大多数和群众的大多数，组成了浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，狠狠地打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！
    我们从一年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践中，深深体会到毛主席一再指出的这一真理：两个阶级、两条道路斗争的根本问题是政权问题。要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色，就必须掌握和运用毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的伟大学说，分清敌我，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，始终把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    运用正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的伟大学说，抓住主要矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    毛主席指出：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”“为了正确地认识敌我之间和人民内部这两类不同的矛盾，应该首先弄清楚什么是人民，什么是敌人。”毛主席告诉我们：“一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”在无产阶级专政条件下，谁是我们的主要敌人呢？毛主席又教导我们，革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是国内外阶级敌人在党内的代理人，他们同广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。
    承不承认无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要矛盾，敢不敢把斗争矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是区别真革命和假革命的显著标志。
    我们体会到，在无产阶级文化大革命中，从始至终能明确认识无产阶级和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是主要矛盾，而在实践中又能真正抓住这个主要矛盾，并不是一件轻而易举的简单事情。抓住这个主要矛盾的过程，实际上也就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的过程，同时，也是掌握和运用毛主席关于正确处理两类矛盾伟大学说的过程。
    无产阶级文化大革命刚开始，埋藏在海军党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了保护自己，蒙混过关，顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，极力鼓吹军队“特殊”论和阶级斗争熄灭论，使部分群众一度受蒙蔽，从而模糊了主要矛盾。针对这个情况，我们带着问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”毛主席的这一指示，为我们拨开了迷雾，擦亮了眼睛，清醒了头脑，使我们认识到军队内部同样存在着阶级斗争，同样有走资本主义道路的当权派。埋藏在军队内部的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是最危险的定时炸弹。
    怎样识别这一小撮敌人呢？毛主席指出，阶级分析的方法是了解情况、分析敌我的最根本的方法。林副主席说：阶级和阶级斗争是阶级社会现象的总根源。离开了这个总根源去观察社会现象，就会把事情混淆起来，是非颠倒起来，就会观察错了。根据毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，我们分析了现实生活中的大量现象，逐步懂得了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是一小撮打着“红旗”反红旗的修正主义分子。识别这些人既不能看资格、地位，也不能单看出身，一定要分清他是毛主席的无产阶级司令部的人，还是资产阶级司令部的人，看他对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线是拥护还是反对。根据这个认识，我们进一步分析了海直机关文化大革命以来的许多现象：为什么一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命左派干部受到打击而极少数坏人却能够横行无阻？为什么群众的革命大字报受到围攻？为什么刚一开始批判资产阶级反动路线就有人出来说我们单位不存在反动路线？所有这些问题，引起了我们的深思，使我们认识到，我们这里同样有两个司令部、两条路线的斗争；并且根据大量确凿的材料，逐步识破了隐藏在海军内部的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的真面目。在毛主席、林副主席的英明领导和亲自指引下，在批判资产阶级反动路线的革命高潮中，我们无产阶级革命派，冲破了重重阻力，终于把隐藏很深的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来。
    在混进党内的资产阶级代表人物被揪出之后，无产阶级革命派还要不要把斗争矛头继续指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派？
    有人认为，混进党内的资产阶级代表人物揪出来了，敌我矛盾已经基本解决了，敌人已经是“死老虎”，处理他们的问题只不过是一桩“案件”，无须继续兴师动众去同他们进行针锋相对的斗争了。我们认为，这种意见是错误的。揪出了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，这并不意味着敌我斗争的结束，而是标志着敌我斗争开始了一个新阶段。毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”事实正是这样，被揪出来的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，人还在，心不死，他们一次又一次地进行反扑，妄想夺回他们失去的“天堂”。他们决不是“死老虎”。只有把他们彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们的那一套修正主义货色彻底批深批透批臭；只有把他们的黑线连根拔掉，把他们的影响彻底肃清，才能防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政。真正的无产阶级革命派，一定要有痛打“落水狗”的精神，要肯在斗、批、改上狠下功夫。这是无限热爱毛主席，对党对人民高度负责的具体表现。认为“打死老虎没油水”，“敌人已经打倒了，敌我矛盾变成次要了”，因而不愿坐下来做艰苦细致的批判工作，热衷于打“内战”，到处跑跑串串，丢下重要的敌人不搞，是完全错误的。这样做，转移了斗争大方向，只能使敌人高兴。
    经验告诉我们：在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众、革命干部和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的矛盾始终是主要矛盾，解决这个矛盾的主要方法就是要开展“四大”，就是大批判、大斗争。无产阶级革命派一定要紧紧抓住这个主要矛盾，抓住大批判这个纲，坚定不移地把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    运用正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的伟大学说，严格区分两种当权派和两个司令部
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，运用阶级分析方法，正确地区分与对待无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路的当权派、无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部，这是关系到能否正确掌握斗争大方向的一个非常重要的问题。
    毛主席教导我们，要严格区分两类矛盾，采取不同的态度和方法，正确对待和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派故意混淆无产阶级当权派和资产阶级当权派的界限，故意混淆无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部的界限，煽动群众转移斗争大方向。我们就和他们针锋相对，坚决保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。对于毛主席、林副主席高度评价的、经过长期斗争考验的革命左派领导干部，我们就同他们结合起来，共同战斗，并坚决拥护他们的领导，支持他们为无产阶级掌权、用权，大树无产阶级的革命权威。我们认为，这样做，是符合毛主席关于区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导的，是符合文化大革命发展需要的，是符合党和人民的根本的利益的，也是无产阶级革命战士应尽的义务。
    可是，在我们保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部、同革命左派领导干部实行结合的时候，却遭到某些人的激烈反对。他们诬蔑我们是“御用工具”。我们说，在有阶级的社会里，任何社会组织、政治派别都是阶级斗争和政治斗争的“工具”。问题在于，不当无产阶级的“工具”，就当资产阶级的“工具”，超阶级的组织和派别是没有的。我们对于资产阶级司令部，不仅不当它的“工具”，而且坚决把它彻底砸烂。我们公开申明，我们就是要自觉地当无产阶级的“工具”，当无产阶级专政的“工具”，当贯彻毛主席的革命路线的“工具”，当保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的“工具”。能当好这样的“工具”，我们感到光荣。
    某些反对我们的人，还诬蔑我们是“铁杆老保”。我们顶回了对方的这种诬蔑。毛主席曾经指出：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”爱与恨是有阶级性的。在我们机关内部，有资产阶级的当权派，也有无产阶级的当权派；有好干部，也有坏干部。对于干部不能不分好坏。有爱才有恨，有反才有“保”。怎么会有只爱不恨，或者只恨不爱呢？怎么会有只反不“保”，或者只“保”不反呢？对资产阶级当权派，对坏干部，我们就是要恨，就是要反，而且要一反到底，决不留情。但是对无产阶级当权派，对好干部和比较好的干部，对革命的领导干部，我们不仅不恨，而且要爱；不仅不反，而且要“保”。他们有缺点，我们也要批评。我们爱他们，“保”他们，决不意味着姑息和包庇他们的缺点。但是这种批评是按照处理人民内部矛盾的方法进行的。这同个别别有用心的人要对他们实行“一烧二揪三打倒”，要把他们置于死地，那是截然不同的。那些受党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑唆的个别人，由“打倒一切，否定一切”，走上炮打无产阶级司令部的道路，如果坚持错误、死不回头的话，他们倒是可能变成为党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派忠实效劳的、地地道道的保守派。
    某些反对我们的人，还诬蔑我们是“点头革命派”、“新奴隶主义”。我们说，这些帽子戴不到我们头上。我们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的所谓领导，从来没有唯唯诺诺，卑躬屈膝。相反地，对他们是敢于斗争，敢于造反。在我们队伍中的不少同志冒着被打成“反革命”的风险，同他们作了坚决的斗争。但是，对于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部里的人，对于无产阶级当权派，我们就是要维护他们的威信，服从他们的正确领导。我们要的是无产阶级民主集中制，绝不要资产阶级的自由化和无政府主义。毛主席教导我们：在人民内部，民主和集中是统一的，自由和纪律是统一的，“这个自由是有领导的自由，这个民主是集中指导下的民主，不是无政府状态。无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”我们就是要自觉地服从和维护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，就是要自觉地服从和维护党和军队的纪律，就是要自觉地接受革命领导干部的正确领导。这不是什么“点头革命派”、“新奴隶主义”，而是一个无产阶级革命战士应有的组织纪律性。
    真正的无产阶级革命派是不隐讳自己的政治观点的。我们认为，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了彻底砸烂资产阶级黑司令部，保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，保卫无产阶级专政。敢不敢坚决砸烂资产阶级黑司令部，敢不敢保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，敢不敢坚决斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，敢不敢热情支持和维护革命领导干部的正确领导，这是区别真革命和假革命，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装的战士和可耻的机会主义者的主要标志之一，是对无产阶级革命派的一个严峻的考验。
    运用正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的伟大学说，正确对待犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众
    毛主席教导我们：要“调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义社会这个伟大的事业服务”。还说：必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。
    无产阶级文化大革命的实践经验告诉我们：要始终掌握斗争大方向，团结一切可以团结的人共同对敌，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，还必须正确对待犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众。
    人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导、林彪副主席亲自指挥的人民军队。我军绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的。他们之中的许多老干部更是在毛主席的长期培养教导下，经过长期革命战争的锻炼和考验的好同志。他们无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于无产阶级革命事业，是军队建设的领导骨干。混进我军干部队伍的蜕化变质分子只是“一小撮”。但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，却颠倒是非，混淆黑白，极力推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，恶毒地散布怀疑一切、否定一切和“错误人人有份”的反动谬论。在他们的反动路线和反动思潮的直接影响下，我们有个别单位，在一个时期曾经不分青红皂白地让干部统统靠边站，结果是把应该打击的“一小撮”保护起来，给他们提供了“防空洞”，使他们得以浑水摸鱼，兴风作浪。斗争实践使我们深深懂得：要不要在打击一小撮的同时，坚决团结大多数，实际上是一个要不要分清敌我的根本问题。不去主动团结大多数，就不能真正孤立一小撮，反而会把敌人放走。我们认识到这一点，迅速把团结争取大多数干部的工作抓起来，很快就形成了斗批改的高潮，使一小撮阶级敌人陷入四面包围、处处挨打的境地。
    毛主席说：“我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。记着这两条界限，事情就好办，否则就会把问题的性质弄混淆了。”有些人也划线，但是他们只分“当权派”、“群众”，或者多少级以上，多少级以下，不作阶级分析，不讲路线斗争，结果还是混淆两类矛盾。我们从斗争的大量事实中看出，在两个阶级、两条路线的大搏斗中，每一个人都在自觉不自觉地站队，不是站在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部和无产阶级革命路线一边，就是站在资产阶级司令部和资产阶级反动路线一边。根据这个事实，我们以对待毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线的态度以及林副主席指示的干部的三条标准为依据，对干部队伍进行了阶级分析，认识到真正的坏人只是一小撮，好人是大多数，一部分半好半坏，在斗争中犯过错误的干部，还是可以争取挽救的。根据这个分析，我们把打击了多少坏人，结合了多少好人，挽救了多少半好半坏的人，作为衡量是否贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线的重要标志，作为衡量一个单位搞斗批改成绩大小的重要标志。
    我们根据毛主席对任何问题应采取分析态度，不要否定一切的教导，注意了把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，同由于工作关系跟着犯了错误的人加以区别；把一贯反党、反社会主义分子，同一时说错话、做错事的人加以区别；把混入干部队伍搞阴谋复辟活动的人，同在两个司令部的大搏斗中一时站错了队的人加以区别。在具体分析每一个人的问题时，我们注意了既看小节，又看大节，而主要是看大节；既看一时一事，又看一贯表现，而主要是看一贯表现。这样做的结果，就在不放走坏人的前提下，把打击面缩小到了最低限度。
    对犯错误的干部，我们以毛主席关于“惩前毖后、治病救人”的教导为指针，一方面满腔热情地团结挽救他们，对他们进行耐心而细致的思想工作，主动帮助他们“亮相”，决不采取对待敌人的态度揪住不放；另一方面，又严肃地揭发批判他们的错误，经过斗争，分清是非，使他们真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来，决不讲情面，决不“和稀泥”。这样，就促使犯错误的干部在火热的对敌斗争中，在严肃的批评和自我批评中，在群众的关怀和监督中，逐步认识和改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    能否正确处理群众之间的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的群众，以共同对敌，也是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否夺取最后胜利的一个重要问题。
    我军绝大多数群众都是敢于革命、敢于斗争的。但是，由于人们的觉悟水平不同，在开始时有一部分人表现了某些保守思想；有极少数人在资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽下，对革命左派领导干部和革命造反派进行了恶意的攻击。
    我们革命造反派站在无产阶级革命的立场上，遵循毛主席正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的学说，严格区分敌我。我们对群众中革与保的矛盾，有着和保守派完全不同的看法。一方面我们认为，群众中革与保的矛盾，作为两个阶级、两条路线斗争的具体反映，它是对抗性的，不可调和的；但另一方面我们又认为，保守派中的绝大多数群众还是要革命的，他们只是一时受蒙蔽而站错了队，因而和我们的矛盾总起来看还是属于人民内部的矛盾。毛主席告诫我们：“许多人对于敌我之间的和人民内部的这两类性质不同的矛盾分辨不清，容易混淆在一起。”我们始终严格地把同受蒙蔽群众的矛盾与同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾区别开来，绝不允许把这两类不同性质的矛盾混淆起来，绝不允许把斗争的矛头指向群众。
    为了帮助受蒙蔽的群众尽快地回到毛主席的革命路线上来，我们按照毛主席“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，分清是非，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的教导，用“民主的即说服的方法”，对受蒙蔽的群众进行了大量的思想工作。着重是帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，使他们从思想上真正同那些错误的东西划清界限，总结经验教训。我们严格区分两类矛盾、正确处理两类矛盾的结果，很快消除了受蒙蔽群众对我们的隔阂，在革命的大批判中，逐步实现了革命的大联合，最大限度地孤立了一小撮敌人，大大地促进了革命的大批判和大斗争。
    通过一年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，使我们更加坚信光焰无际的毛泽东思想威力无穷，更加坚信照毛主席的指示办事就是胜利。有毛泽东思想武装，我们什么都不怕，就能“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”。有毛泽东思想撑腰，我们就能顶天立地，十二级台风刮不倒，刀山火海也敢闯。有毛泽东思想导航，我们就能在任何险风恶浪、乌云迷雾的条件下，不迷航，不“晕船”。回顾一年来战斗的历程，我们更加无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，更加无限热爱伟大的毛泽东思想。我们要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
