Stone Gate Middle School's revolutionary teachers and students, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Through a thorough criticism of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, they achieved revolutionary unity, established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, and ushered in a new era of resuming classes and making revolution.

In the process of achieving unity, Stone Gate Middle School's revolutionary teachers and students carried out a rectification campaign with the themes of learning, helping, and exchanging hearts. First, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and focused on criticizing and rectifying selfishness. Second, they conducted criticism and self-criticism and widely assisted each other in thought. Third, based on heightened awareness, various mass organizations, teachers and students, and comrades who had been persecuted or deceived held unity and heart-to-heart meetings to resolve ideological knots and unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The experience of Stone Gate Middle School once again tells us that the proletarian revolutionaries must unite and can unite. We have a common enemy. We must direct all our hatred towards the capitalist-roaders within the Party. We must unite all forces to form a mighty revolutionary army and fight to overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist-roaders within the Party.

We have a common guiding ideology, which is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we can unite as one and fight the enemy together. Even if there are differences and disagreements among revolutionary organizations, we should completely resolve them through democratic discussion, criticism, and self-criticism.

At the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionaries launched a general offensive against the capitalist-roaders within the Party, the 8729 Unit, following Chairman Mao's instructions on military training, came to Stone Gate Middle School in Beijing to assist with military and political training. Under the guidance of the PLA, the school's revolutionary teachers and students raised the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on class analysis, distinguished between two types of contradictions, clarified the enemy and friend, and firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. Through the criticism of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, they achieved revolutionary unity with the proletarian revolutionaries as the core and the teaching classes as the foundation, unified the Red Guard organizations, and established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ—the Cultural Revolution Committee. On April 11, they began "resuming classes and making revolution," pushing the proletarian cultural revolution in the school to a new stage.

All hatred directed towards the capitalist-roaders within the Party

Stone Gate Middle School is a junior middle school with 1,013 students, most of whom are children of workers and poor peasants. There are 64 faculty and staff members. In the early days of the proletarian cultural revolution, their direction was correct, and their revolutionary spirit was high. However, the work team that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line led the vigorous movement astray. They incited students to fight each other, students to fight teachers, and teachers to suppress students, causing serious rifts among teachers, students, and classmates. Even when the military comrades came to the school to assist with military and political training, the bourgeois reactionary line had not been seriously criticized.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." To help the revolutionary teachers and students use class analysis to clarify the enemy and friend, the military comrades organized everyone to study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and visited more than 700 student families, talking with parents and students, recalling the suffering of being oppressed by the exploiting classes in the old society, recognizing the great significance of the current proletarian cultural revolution, and exposing the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Yang Cuilan, a student in Class 6, Grade 2, is the daughter of an old worker from the Capital Iron and Steel Company. Her uncles were killed by the Japanese devils, and her father herded sheep and carried goods for the landlords, enduring immense suffering. The great leader Chairman Mao liberated her family from the misery of the old society. During the cultural revolution, Yang Cuilan suffered severe persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line, was falsely accused, and was driven to despair. Again, it was the great leader Chairman Mao who saved her. This ordinary worker's family, from their personal experiences, recognized the evil of the bourgeois reactionary line formulated by the capitalist-roaders within the Party, aroused strong class hatred, and decided to join all the revolutionary teachers and students to overthrow and expose the bourgeois reactionary line, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death! Yang Cuilan and her father, at the school-wide teachers and students meeting, angrily exposed the persecution of their family by the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang, and the capitalist-roaders within the Party. Their exposure moved many to tears. Some students who had been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line regretted falling for the tricks of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, hurting their class brothers and sisters, and voluntarily made soul-searching examinations. Thus, a mass movement of recalling bitterness and exposing crimes quickly spread throughout the school. Revolutionary teachers and students took action, listing crimes, analyzing dangers, tracing roots, and vowing to uproot the bourgeois reactionary line. Through recalling bitterness and exposing crimes, the revolutionary rebels realized that the serious rifts and oppositions among the masses were completely caused by the bourgeois reactionary line. They helped the deceived students break free from the control of the bourgeois reactionary line, return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and direct all their hatred towards the capitalist-roaders within the Party who formulated this bourgeois reactionary line.

After clarifying the main target of the proletarian cultural revolution, the military comrades, in response to the situation where the leading cadres had not come forward and the class lines were not clear, guided everyone to use class analysis to expose the class struggle in the school and draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. The class lines among the leading cadres and the teaching staff became clear. The military comrades then organized everyone to study "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and helped the students correctly treat cadres who had made mistakes, encouraging cadres to overcome selfishness, discard the fear, and bravely come forward to the masses. Some leading cadres made relatively sincere examinations, which were welcomed by the broad revolutionary teachers and students, laying a good foundation for establishing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Chairman Mao taught us: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a mighty revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution."

Stone Gate Middle School has more than 20 revolutionary teacher and student mass organizations that cross classes and teaching research groups. These organizations played an active role in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. However, these mass organizations, to varying degrees, had non-proletarian ideological tendencies such as factionalism, individualism, and anarchism, hindering the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. Some thought, "I can make a name for myself, my contributions are great, unity should come to me." Some who had not joined any organization thought that unity had nothing to do with them and that not uniting was more free.

The military comrades believed that these thoughts ultimately stemmed from an "ego." They mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students to adopt the methods of learning, helping, and exchanging hearts to carry out a mass rectification campaign. Learning involved studying Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Three Constantly Read Articles," and other brilliant works, focusing on criticizing and rectifying selfishness. Helping involved conducting criticism and self-criticism and widely assisting each other in thought. Exchanging hearts involved, based on heightened awareness, holding unity and heart-to-heart meetings among various mass organizations, teachers and students, and those who had been persecuted or deceived, resolving ideological knots, and uniting under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In Class 6, Grade 3, members of three mass organizations, through study and discussion, gradually clarified that they must be self-critical, and also be critical of other organizations. Revolution does not distinguish between early and late, and organizations do not distinguish between big and small. As long as they stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the direction is the same, they are all proletarian revolutionaries, and they should prioritize the revolutionary cause, seek common ground while reserving differences, and quickly unite to fight together. This class was the first in the school to achieve revolutionary unity with the proletarian revolutionaries as the core and the teaching classes as the foundation.

The unity of Class 6, Grade 3, caused a strong reaction among the entire school's teachers and students. Two mass organizations that had previously been in severe opposition compared themselves with Class 6, Grade 3, and realized: eliminating the "ego," uniting to fight the enemy, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest public service; conversely, starting from personal and small group interests, forgetting class struggle, forgetting the struggle between the two lines, and being eager to "fight internal wars" is the greatest selfishness, which is to reverse the direction of the movement and fall for the tricks of the capitalist-roaders within the Party. They discarded the "ego" and achieved revolutionary unity.

In the drumbeat of unity, members of various revolutionary organizations returned to their classes, achieving the unity of revolutionary organizations and uniting the majority. Each class established cultural revolution small groups and Red Guard service groups, and the entire school achieved revolutionary unity with the proletarian revolutionaries as the core and the teaching classes as the foundation. The Red Guard headquarters was established. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ was established. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line achieved a great victory in Stone Gate Middle School.

The struggle needs unity, and unity is for better struggle. The revolutionary teachers and students of Stone Gate Middle School, after achieving revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to resume classes and make revolution, pushing the proletarian cultural revolution to a new stage.

Some people had worried that resuming classes and making revolution would cause the cultural revolution to "abort." The military comrades assisted the school's cultural revolution committee in organizing everyone to study the "Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Middle Schools" and related editorials in the newspapers, helping the broad revolutionary teachers and students to clarify: resuming classes and making revolution is to resume the classes of Mao Zedong Thought; it is to take the struggle between the two lines as the key, to further criticize the capitalist-roaders within the Party and their poisonous weed "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation," to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to deepen and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

On April 11, Stone Gate Middle School held a rally to resume classes and make revolution, launching a general offensive against the capitalist-roaders within the Party. After the rally, in just a few days, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students wrote more than 3,000 articles criticizing the capitalist-roaders within the Party and their poisonous weed "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation." The momentum was overwhelming, the target was clear, the firepower was fierce, and they fought a brilliant "people's war" that the school had never seen before.

In the great criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students strengthened their class and class struggle perspective, heightened their understanding of the struggle between the two lines, further aroused their limitless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and quickly launched a new high tide of mass study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The entire school established 96 Mao Zedong Thought study small groups, with the vast majority of teachers and students and many parents participating, studying together, helping each other, and improving together. They insisted on one hour of daily reading, come rain or shine. The masses also created a new form of studying Chairman Mao's works, "morning report, evening summary," which is to take the problems in the struggle between the two lines to Chairman Mao's works for guidance in the morning; in the evening, to summarize the day's progress and problems in thought, and conduct self-criticism in light of Chairman Mao's teachings. The school was filled with a strong political atmosphere. Good deeds of mutual care and helping others became more and more common. Revolution promoted science and organizational discipline. Class 6, Grade 2, was originally a class with poor discipline and frequent arguments. After unity, they clarified the direction of the struggle, and the vast majority of students formed a united, disciplined, and strong fighting collective.

Currently, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students have already broken the situation where bourgeois intellectuals dominated the school with their actual actions and begun to establish a new type of teacher-student relationship. In the classroom, teachers and students study together, teach each other, and learn from each other. When Liu Qingping and other students from Class 3, Grade 3, gave a lecture on the "Three Constantly Read Articles," they openly shared their thoughts and fought selfishness, deeply educating both students and teachers. Revolutionary teachers gradually changed their previous state of lecturing without touching the soul and fought side by side with the students, turning the classroom into a battlefield for eliminating bourgeois ideas and promoting proletarian ideas.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The birth of a new social system is always accompanied by a great shout, which is to propagate the superiority of the new system and criticize the backwardness of the old system." The revolutionary teachers and students of Stone Gate Middle School, in the great shout, braved the waves and took the first step. They are determined to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, consolidate revolutionary unity, better resume classes and make revolution, deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the school, and turn Stone Gate Middle School into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    石景山中学是怎样在解放军帮助下复课闹革命的？
    在革命的大批判中实现革命大联合
    编者按：石景山中学的革命师生，在人民解放军的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，通过对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，实现了革命的大联合，建立起革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，出现了复课闹革命的新气象。
    石景山中学的革命师生，在实现大联合的过程中，开展了一学、二帮、三交心的整风运动。一是学习毛主席的有关著作，狠抓破私立公。二是开展批评和自我批评，广泛进行思想互助。三是在提高认识的基础上，各个群众组织之间，师生之间，受迫害和受蒙蔽的同志之间，举行团结交心会，解开思想疙瘩，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下团结起来。
    石景山中学的经验又一次告诉我们，无产阶级革命派必须联合起来，而且可以联合起来。
    因为我们有共同的敌人，我们要把千仇万恨，集中到党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的身上。我们要团结一切力量，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    因为我们有共同的指导思想，这就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想作武器，我们就可以团结一致，共同对敌。即使革命组织之间产生了不同的意见和分歧，也完全应该采取民主讨论、批评和自我批评等方法加以解决。
    在无产阶级革命派向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的关键时刻，8729部队遵照毛主席关于军训的指示，来到北京石景山中学帮助进行军政训练。石景山中学的革命师生高举无产阶级革命的批判大旗，牢记毛主席关于阶级分析的教导，注意区分两类不同性质的矛盾，分清敌我友，紧紧掌握斗争大方向。在解放军的帮助下，在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，实现了以无产阶级革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的革命大联合，统一了红卫兵组织，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——文化革命委员会，于四月十一日开始“复课闹革命”，把学校的无产阶级文化大革命推向了一个新的阶段。
    千仇万恨，对准党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派
    石景山中学是一所初级中学，有一千零十三名学生，大多数是工人和贫下中农的子女。教职员工有六十四人。无产阶级文化大革命初期，他们的大方向正确，斗志昂扬，革命的烈火迅速燃起。可是，执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组，把朝气蓬勃的运动引入了歧途。他们挑动群众斗群众，群众斗干部，干部整群众，造成师生之间、同学之间、教师之间严重的隔阂。直到部队同志来校帮助军政训练的时候，这里对资产阶级反动路线还没有认真批判。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”为了帮助革命师生用阶级分析的方法认清敌我友，部队同志组织大家学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》，又走访了七百多个学生的家庭，同家长和学生们谈心，一道回忆在旧社会受剥削阶级压迫的痛苦，认识当前无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，控诉资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。二年级六班学生杨翠兰是首都钢铁公司一个老工人的女儿。她的伯父、叔叔都被日本鬼子杀害，她的父亲给地主放羊、扛活，受尽了折磨。伟大的领袖毛主席把他们一家从旧社会的苦难中解放了出来。在文化大革命运动中，杨翠兰遭到资产阶级反动路线的严重迫害，被安上莫须有的罪名，逼得走投无路，又是伟大的领袖毛主席把她救了出来。这个普通工人的一家，从切身体会中认清了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所制定的资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，激起强烈的阶级仇恨，决心同全校革命师生一起把资产阶级反动路线批倒、批臭，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！杨翠兰和她的父亲在石景山中学全校师生大会上，愤怒控诉了日本强盗、国民党和党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派对他们一家的迫害。他们的控诉，感动得不少人流下了热泪。一些受过资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同学，悔恨自己上了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的当，伤害了阶级兄弟姐妹，主动作了触及灵魂的检查。于是，群众性的忆苦控诉活动迅速在全校展开。革命师生积极行动起来，列罪状，论危害，挖根源，誓把资产阶级反动路线连根拔掉。通过忆苦控诉，使革命造反派认识到，群众之间的严重隔阂和对立，完全是资产阶级反动路线造成的，他们帮助受蒙蔽的同学从资产阶级反动路线的控制下解放出来，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，把千仇万恨集中到制定这条资产阶级反动路线的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的身上。
    明确了无产阶级文化大革命的主要对象之后，部队同志针对当时领导干部没有亮相、阶级阵线不清的情况，引导大家运用阶级分析的方法，大揭学校阶级斗争的盖子，划清革命和反革命、无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的界限。领导干部和教师队伍的阶级阵线明朗了。部队同志又组织大家学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，帮助学生正确对待犯了错误的干部，鼓励干部克服私心，丢掉“怕”字，勇敢地到群众中来亮相。有的领导干部做了比较诚恳的检查，受到广大革命师生的欢迎，为建立革命的“三结合”打下良好的基础。破私立公，促进革命大联合
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”
    石景山中学有二十多个跨班、跨教研组的革命师生群众组织。这些组织是从去年十一月以来陆续成立的。他们在批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中起了积极的作用。但是，这些群众组织内部，程度不同地存在山头主义、风头主义、无政府主义等非无产阶级思想倾向，妨碍着无产阶级革命派的大联合。有的认为“我能闯，贡献大，要联合得向我靠拢”。一些没有参加组织的人，认为大联合与己无关，不联合更自由。
    部队同志认为，这些思想归根结底是一个“私”字。他们发动革命师生采取一学、二帮、三交心的方法，展开群众性的整风学习运动。一学，是学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、“老三篇”等光辉著作，狠抓破私立公。二帮，是开展批评和自我批评，广泛进行思想互助。三交心，是在提高认识的基础上，各群众组织之间，师生之间，受迫害和受蒙蔽的人之间，举行团结交心会，解开思想疙瘩，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下团结起来。三年级六班有三个群众组织的成员，在学习讨论中，逐步明确对自己必须一分为二，对别的组织也要一分为二。革命不分先后，组织不分大小，只要站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，大方向一致，都是无产阶级革命派，就要以革命大局为重，求大同存小异，迅速联合起来，共同战斗。这个班在全校第一个实现了以无产阶级革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的大联合。
    三年级六班的联合，引起了全校师生的强烈反响。有两个过去对立比较严重的群众组织，对照三年级六班找差距，认识到：破除“私”字，联合对敌，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这就是最大的为公；相反，从个人和小团体利益出发，忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了两条路线斗争，热中于“打内战”，这就是最大的为私，是扭转运动的大方向，上了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的当。他们抛掉“私”字，实现了革命的大联合。
    在大联合的战鼓声中，各革命组织的成员回到班级，实行革命组织的大联合，团结大多数。各班成立了文化革命小组和红卫兵勤务组，全校实现了以无产阶级革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的革命大联合。红卫兵总部成立了。革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构建立起来了。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在石景山中学取得了重大的胜利。
    复课闹革命，把无产阶级文化大革命推向新阶段
    斗争需要联合，联合是为了更好地斗争。石景山中学的革命师生，在实现革命的大联合，革命的“三结合”之后，热烈响应毛主席提出的复课闹革命的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命推向新阶段。
    有人曾经担心复课闹革命会使文化大革命“夭折”。部队同志协助校文化革命委员会组织大家学习了《中共中央关于中学无产阶级文化大革命的意见》和报纸有关社论，帮助广大革命师生明确：复课闹革命，是复毛泽东思想的课；是以两条路线斗争为纲，更深入地批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的《修养》，批判资产阶级反动路线，把本单位的斗批改搞深搞透。
    四月十一日，石景山中学召开了复课闹革命、向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的誓师大会。会后，短短几天之内，全校革命师生就写了三千多篇批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他的大毒草《修养》的文章。声势浩大，目标集中，火力猛烈，打了一场这个学校前所未有的漂亮的“人民战争”。
    在大批判中，革命师生增强了阶级和阶级斗争的观点，提高了对两条路线斗争的认识，进一步激发了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚，迅速掀起一个群众性活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。全校成立了九十六个毛主席著作学习小组，绝大部分师生和许多家长都参加进来，一起学习，互相帮助，共同提高。每天坚持一小时天天读，做到雷打不动。群众还创造了“早请示，晚汇报”的学习毛主席著作的新形式，就是早晨带着两条路线斗争中的问题，向毛主席著作请示；晚上，把一天来思想上的进步和问题，对照毛主席的教导进行自我批评。校内校外充满了浓厚的政治空气。互相关心、助人为乐的好人好事一天比一天多。革命性带动了科学性和组织纪律性。二年级六班原是个纪律涣散、经常吵架的班级，大联合以后，认清了斗争的大方向，全班绝大多数学生结成了一支思想统一、有无产阶级组织纪律的、坚强的战斗集体。
    目前，全校革命师生已经以自己的实际行动打破了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的局面，开始建立新型的师生关系。课堂上，师生共同研究，互教互学，教学相长。三年级三班学生刘庆平等讲“老三篇”辅导课时，亮思想不怕丑，斗私心不怕疼，使同学和老师都受到深刻的教育。革命教师逐步改变着过去那种讲课不触及灵魂的状态，和同学们并肩战斗，把课堂当成灭资兴无的战场。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个新的社会制度的诞生，总是要伴随一场大喊大叫的，这就是宣传新制度的优越性，批判旧制度的落后性。”石景山中学的革命师生在大喊大叫中顶着风浪迈出了第一步。他们决心牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，巩固革命的大联合，更好地复课闹革命，深入开展本单位的斗批改，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，把石景山中学办成一所红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
