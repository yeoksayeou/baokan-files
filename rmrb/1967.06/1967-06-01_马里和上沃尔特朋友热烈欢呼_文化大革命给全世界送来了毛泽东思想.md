Friends from Mali and Upper Volta Warmly Hail the Cultural Revolution Bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the World

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bamako: Recently, friends from Mali and Upper Volta spoke with Xinhua News Agency reporters, enthusiastically praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently unfolding in China. A Malian engineer said excitedly: "Chairman Mao once said, 'The October Revolution sent its reverberations around the world, bringing us Marxism-Leninism.' Now, it is China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that brings us contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the invincible weapon of all revolutionaries—Mao Zedong Thought."

A Malian teacher said: "The storm of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has shaken the world, bringing revolutionary spirit to the oppressed peoples of all countries."

A Malian friend said: "In the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao have exposed the Chinese Khrushchev, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

Another Malian friend said: "We place our hopes in China and Chairman Mao." "The victory of the Chinese people is our guarantee of victory."

A friend from Upper Volta said:

"After the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists, the peoples of all countries now look to China." He added, "If Chairman Mao had not launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, then, like the current situation in the Soviet Union, the bourgeois elements would have surrounded the revolutionaries, and the Chinese revolution would have been strangled. Therefore, Chairman Mao's launching of the Cultural Revolution is extremely wise and timely. This is a great thing for the revolutionary peoples of all countries."

    马里和上沃尔特朋友热烈欢呼
    文化大革命给全世界送来了毛泽东思想
    据新华社巴马科电　马里和上沃尔特的朋友最近在同新华社记者谈话时，热烈赞扬正在中国深入开展的无产阶级文化大革命。一位马里工程师十分激动地说：毛主席曾说，“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”现在是中国的无产阶级文化大革命，给全世界送来了当代的马克思列宁主义、一切革命者的战无不胜的武器——毛泽东思想。
    一位马里教员说：“中国文化大革命的风暴震撼了世界，它给各国被压迫人民带来了革命精神。”
    一位马里朋友说：“在文化大革命中，由毛主席领导的中国人民把中国的赫鲁晓夫揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”
    另一位马里朋友说：“我们把希望寄托在中国和毛主席的身上。”“中国人民的胜利是我们胜利的保证。”
    一位上沃尔特朋友说：
  “在苏联修正主义者背叛革命以后，现在各国人民都眼望着中国。”他还说，“如果不是毛主席发动无产阶级文化大革命，那末象苏联现在的情况一样，资产阶级分子就会围剿革命者，中国的革命就会被扼杀。因此，毛主席发动文化大革命是非常英明及时的。这对各国革命人民是一件大好事。”
