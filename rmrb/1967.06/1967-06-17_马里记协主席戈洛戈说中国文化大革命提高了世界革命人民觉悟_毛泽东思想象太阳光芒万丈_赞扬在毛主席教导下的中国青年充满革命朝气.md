Mamadou Gologo, Chairman of the Malian Journalists' Association, member of the Political Bureau of the Malian Union Party, and Minister of Information and Tourism of Mali, who is currently in Beijing attending the fifth plenary meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, spoke to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency. He enthusiastically praised the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao's personal initiation and leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Gologo said, "Chairman Mao has devoted all his energy to defending the cause of the proletariat and laboring masses both in his own country and around the world." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is like a blazing red sun, shining with boundless rays, illuminating the revolutionary path for the people of the world."

Gologo spoke of his impressions from this visit to China, saying, "I have been deeply moved by the ideological and political struggle of the Chinese working masses, a stormy and irresistible struggle. The Chinese working masses have always been loyal to their victorious proletarian revolutionary traditions and loyal to the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought."

He said, "As long as one is a firm revolutionary, a steadfast fighter for the proletarian cause, and firmly supports and is loyal to the masses of the people, anyone in any country can understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, regardless of where they live outside of China."

Gologo said, "After experiencing the atmosphere of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what I feel most deeply is that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is truly a people's movement." "The surging waves of the Cultural Revolution, with the boundless brilliance of the thought of Chairman Mao Zedong as their inexhaustible source, are raising the fearless revolutionary consciousness of the great Chinese people."

Gologo went on to say, "This Cultural Revolution makes the Chinese people and revolutionaries around the world strongly feel the meaning of life." "Life is not just about existence; life first and foremost means struggle, means daring to continuously improve society. To live bravely is to live with the spirit of revolutionaries and proletarians, to be good at struggle, and to always ask: how was it in the past, how is it now, and how will it be in the future?"

Gologo refuted the fallacy that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is supposedly a "pure power struggle" among leaders.

He pointed out, "In fact, this is a revolution to universally raise the revolutionary consciousness of the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world. The enemies of the proletarian cultural revolution harbor illusions about this, but they are mistaken."

He said, "It is rare to see a party or mass organization that dares to allow the people to publicly criticize its policies and actions. The Cultural Revolution allows every Chinese person to express their opinions to the Party and any leader and to publicly express their views through big-character posters." "Clearly, fighting against one's own shortcomings is a sign of courage and the best proof." He expressed his respectful salute to the Chinese people who have set a brave example.

Gologo emphasized that in China, everything depends on the people. Therefore, China is not afraid of the imperialists and other reactionaries who are madly opposing the people of various countries.

Gologo also praised the Chinese youth, who are full of revolutionary vigor under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Chinese youth are the only youth in the world who dare to erect a barrier against the corrupting tide of Western society that is rampant around the world. Therefore, I am convinced that the Cultural Revolution and political mission have been entrusted to reliable people."

    马里记协主席戈洛戈说中国文化大革命提高了世界革命人民觉悟
    毛泽东思想象太阳光芒万丈
    赞扬在毛主席教导下的中国青年充满革命朝气
    新华社十五日讯　正在北京出席亚非新闻工作者协会第五次书记处全体会议的马里记协主席、马里苏丹联盟党政治局委员、马里新闻、游览部部长马马杜·戈洛戈对新华社记者发表谈话，热情赞扬光焰无际的毛泽东思想和伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。
    戈洛戈说，毛泽东主席把全部精力献给保卫本国和全世界无产阶级和劳动群众的事业。他说：“毛泽东思想犹如火热的红太阳，放射出万丈光芒，照亮了世界人民的革命道路。”
    戈洛戈谈到他这次访问中国的观感时说：“我被中国劳动群众的这场意识形态和政治方面的势不可挡的、暴风雨般的巨大斗争吸引住了，中国劳动群众始终忠于他们无产阶级革命的胜利传统，始终忠于光焰无际的毛泽东思想。”
    他说：“只要是一个坚定的革命者，只要是无产阶级事业的坚定战士，只要坚定地支持和忠于人民群众，任何国家的任何人都能了解无产阶级文化大革命，不论他生活在中国之外的什么地方。”
    戈洛戈说：“接触了无产阶级文化大革命的气氛之后，使我感受最深的是无产阶级文化大革命具有真正的人民性。”“以天才的毛泽东主席思想为取之不尽的源泉的文化大革命的汹涌澎湃的浪潮，正在提高伟大的中国人民的无所畏惧的革命觉悟。”
    戈洛戈接着说：“这场文化大革命使得中国人民和全世界革命者强烈地感受到生活的意义。”“生活不仅仅意味着生存，生活首先意味着斗争，意味着敢于不断使社会得到改进。勇敢地生活，就是按革命者和无产阶级的气概生活，就是善于斗争，善于随时问一个过去怎样，现在怎样，又要变成怎样。”
    戈洛戈驳斥那些蓄意把中国文化大革命歪曲为所谓领导人之间的“纯系争权夺利的斗争”的谬论。
    他指出：“事实上，这是普遍提高中国人民和世界各国革命人民的革命觉悟的一场革命。无产阶级文化革命的敌人对此抱有幻想，是打错了算盘。”
    他说：“敢于让人民公开批评自己的方针和行动的政党或群众组织是少见的。而文化大革命使每一个中国人都能向党和任何一个领导人提出和用大字报公开表示自己的意见。”“很明显，同自己的缺点作斗争，是有勇气的和最好的证明。”他表示，向树立了勇敢榜样的中国人民致以战斗的敬礼。
    戈洛戈强调说，在中国，一切都依靠人民。因此，中国是不怕正在疯狂地反对各国人民的帝国主义者和其他反动派的。
    戈洛戈还赞扬在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国青年充满革命的青春朝气。他说：“中国青年是世界上唯一敢于同在世界上泛滥着的西方社会腐化的逆流之间树立起一道屏障的青年。因此，我确信，文化大革命和政治使命交给了可靠的人。”
