In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the suburbs of Shanghai have made significant strides forward. Wheat and rapeseed are now generally ripe, and the yield is expected to be 10 to 30 percent higher than last year.

Currently, the revolutionary criticism movement is deeply unfolding in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs. This has become the strongest political driving force for the "three summers" battle. The broad masses of peasants and cadres are full of vigor and high morale. The progress of summer harvesting and the quality of the harvest are unprecedented in previous years.

The Shanghai suburbs have a high rate of double cropping and dense crop rotation. While intensively carrying out summer harvesting, people are also racing against time to plant summer crops and manage autumn crops. Fields that have been harvested for double-cropping rice are immediately flooded and plowed, and early rice is transplanted. The fields present a moving scene of "yellow in the morning and green in the evening."

The natural conditions in the Shanghai suburbs are relatively good. However, this year's summer crops encountered prolonged low temperatures, heavy rain, and strong winds, as well as pests and diseases, which are rare in many years. The broad masses of peasants and cadres in the suburbs, armed with the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong, bravely faced the challenges of nature and finally achieved the first summer harvest in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last autumn, the broad masses of peasants and cadres in the suburbs enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In February of this year, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai went to the countryside to support agriculture. Under the specific help and leadership of this propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the suburban countryside has developed more broadly and deeply. The broad masses of peasants regard Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest criterion for their words and deeds, which fundamentally guarantees the victory of the revolution and production in the suburban countryside.

    上海郊区夺得夏季丰收
    比去年增产一至三成。广大农民争分夺秒进行夏种和精管秋熟作物
    据新华社上海四日电  在文化大革命中阔步前进的上海郊区，大、元麦已经普遍登场。从十个县传来的喜讯表明，一般要比去年增产一成到三成。小麦、油菜相继黄熟，结实累累。
    当前正在上海郊区农村深入开展的革命的大批判运动，成了推动农村“三夏”战斗的最强大的政治动力。广大农民和干部意气风发，斗志昂扬，夏收进度之快，收获质量之高，是往年所少见的。
    上海郊区复种指数很高，茬口很密。人们在紧张地进行夏收的同时，又争分夺秒地进行夏种和精管秋熟作物。后茬种稻的麦田，收完一块，马上放水犁田，栽上早稻，田间出现“早晨一片黄，晚上一片青”的动人景象。
    上海郊区自然条件较好。但是，今年这里的夏熟作物，在生长过程中遇到了多年未见的长时期的低温多雨和暴风，并且遇到了病虫害。郊区广大农民和干部，以光焰无际的毛泽东思想为武器，勇敢地迎击了大自然的挑战，终于夺得了文化大革命中的第一个夏季丰收。
    去年秋天，郊区广大农民和干部热烈响应林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的号召，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。今年二月间，驻上海的解放军指战员下乡支援农业。在这一支毛泽东思想宣传队的具体帮助和带动下，郊区农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，更广泛、更深入地向前发展。广大农民把毛主席指示作为自己言论和行动的最高准则，从根本上保证了郊区农村革命和生产的胜利前进。
