The Malayan National Liberation League's Delegation in China issued a statement on May 30, representing the people of Malaya (including Singapore), strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong against Chinese workers and other Chinese residents. The delegation fully supports the five demands proposed in the statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the four demands of the Chinese residents in Hong Kong.

The statement points out that the fascist atrocities of British imperialism are a serious provocation against the seven hundred million great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, against all oppressed nations and peoples, and especially against the Malayan people, who are guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and share a common enemy with the Chinese people.

The statement says that Chairman Mao teaches us that hoping to persuade imperialists and all reactionaries to "have a change of heart and turn over a new leaf" is impossible. The only way is to organize forces and struggle against them. The Chinese people in Hong Kong are putting Chairman Mao's teachings into action. We firmly support them. We believe that victory belongs to them.

The statement concludes by calling on the people of Malaya (including Singapore) to unite and intensify their struggle against British imperialism and its puppet regime in Malaya. This struggle will be a direct support for the Chinese residents in Hong Kong in their fight against the British imperialists' bloody suppression.

    谴责英帝血腥镇压香港中国居民
    据新华社讯　马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团五月三十日发表声明，代表马来亚（包括新加坡）全体人民，强烈谴责香港英国当局继续对中国工人和其他中国居民的法西斯暴行，全力支持中国外交部声明中提出的五项要求，以及香港中国居民的四项要求。
    声明指出，英帝国主义者的法西斯暴行，是对用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿伟大中国人民、对一切被压迫的国家和人民，特别是对受战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导的、和中国人民有着共同敌人的马来亚人民的严重挑衅。
    声明说，毛泽东主席教导我们，希望劝说帝国主义者和一切反动派“发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。香港的中国人民正在把毛泽东主席的这一教导付诸行动。我们最坚决地支持他们。我们相信，胜利是属于他们的。
    声明最后说，马来亚民族解放同盟代表团号召马来亚（包括新加坡）人民团结起来，加紧对英帝国主义及其傀儡马来亚的斗争，这一斗争将是对香港中国居民反对英帝国主义血腥镇压的斗争的直接支持。
