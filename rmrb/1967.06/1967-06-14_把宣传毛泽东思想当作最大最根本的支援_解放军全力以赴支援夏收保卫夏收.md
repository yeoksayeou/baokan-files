The People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces have resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have formed labor armies and marched to the forefront of agricultural production to support and protect the summer harvest.

Various units regard supporting the local summer harvest as a major political task. Many units' party committees have conducted thorough studies and made specific arrangements for supporting the summer harvest. They have also organized the broad ranks of officers and soldiers to further study Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." Some units have organized cadres and soldiers who work in rural areas to return to the unit and report on the revolutionary and production situations in the countryside. Through their studies, the officers and soldiers have come to understand that the bumper harvest of summer crops this year is the result of the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" during the Cultural Revolution. It is the result of the revolutionary masses studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It is a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers are determined to carry forward the glorious tradition of the army being both a fighting force and a work force and a production force. They will devote all their efforts to support and protect the summer harvest. When the summer crops in various places begin to be harvested, the units stationed in rural areas immediately provide support on the spot. Units not stationed in rural areas also spring into action, leaving their offices and barracks to join the summer harvest battle.

The Nanjing forces, during the busy summer harvesting and planting season, send tens of thousands of laborers to the agricultural front lines every day. The Jinan forces currently have tens of thousands of officers and soldiers dispatched to rural areas to participate in the rush harvesting and planting. A certain unit of the Chengdu forces has, up to now, contributed over 27,000 labor days to support the local summer harvest. In places like Guangdong and Fujian, where the agricultural season starts early, the units have all established new merits in the summer harvest work. The officers and soldiers stationed on Hainan Island, together with the broad masses of commune members, have rushed to harvest early rice in the scorching sun and pouring rain, achieving fine harvesting and clean threshing, ensuring that every grain is collected and stored, and achieving a bumper harvest. The soldiers sent to support the summer harvest in Longxi Plain, the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, and the Minzhong region of Fujian have, with the spirit of "seizing the day," fought continuously, helping the rural people's communes to achieve their first good summer harvest since the Cultural Revolution. The officers and soldiers stationed in the Awa Mountains of Yunnan, holding sickles, carrying backpacks, and carrying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," have marched to the agricultural front lines. They have faced difficulties head-on, tackled the heaviest tasks, and ensured a comprehensive victory in the local summer harvest and planting. The officers and soldiers of the East China Sea Fleet's 322 ship, who have just completed the task of supporting local transportation and returned to the port, immediately set out for the countryside to support the summer harvest upon hearing that the local summer harvest has begun. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praise them as the people's excellent sons and daughters.

In supporting the summer harvest, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers regard promoting Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest and most fundamental support for the revolutionary masses and cadres. They work and study Mao Zedong's works with the masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the fields and courtyards. They propagate the party's policies and guidelines to the masses and propagate the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some units have also organized performance teams and propaganda teams to use various artistic forms to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; they expose the heinous crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. The officers and soldiers of a certain artillery unit of the Jinan forces, while working in the countryside, closely combine the actual situation of the summer harvest with the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. When they find that some people do not harvest thoroughly, they study Chairman Mao's teachings on frugality with the commune members; when the work is tiring, they sing with the commune members, "Determine to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and other quotations from Chairman Mao. Some platoons of officers and soldiers use their rest time to hold study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works in the fields with the commune members and revolutionary youngsters, exchange learning experiences, and introduce learning methods, thereby greatly inspiring the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the commune members.

In supporting the summer harvest, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance at all times to prevent class enemies from sabotaging the summer harvest. They use their labor rest time to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle with the commune members and militiamen, enhancing the revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses and militiamen. Many units also coordinate with local militiamen to strengthen patrols and protect the summer harvest.

The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Beijing, while supporting the summer harvest of the production team in their stationed area, enthusiastically help the revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

    把宣传毛泽东思想当作最大最根本的支援
    解放军全力以赴支援夏收保卫夏收
    据新华社十三日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，组成了一支支劳动大军，浩浩荡荡，开赴农业生产第一线，支援夏收，保卫夏收。
    各部队把支援地方夏收当作一项重大的政治任务。许多部队党委对支援夏收工作都认真作了研究，进行了具体部署，并组织广大指战员进一步学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示。有的部队还组织了在农村担任支农工作的干部战士回部队介绍农村革命和生产的情况。指战员们通过学习，认识到今年夏熟作物大丰收，是农村广大社员和革命干部，在文化大革命中贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果，是革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是无产阶级文化大革命又一丰硕果实，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。广大指战员决心发扬我军既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的光荣传统，全力以赴，支援夏收，保卫夏收。当各地夏熟作物开始收割时，正在农村的部队，立即就地支援；不在农村的部队，也闻风而动，纷纷走出机关、营房，投入夏收战斗。
    南京部队在夏收、夏种大忙季节，每天投入农业战线的劳动力数以万计。济南部队目前派往农村参加抢收、抢种的指战员成千上万。成都部队某部到目前为止，支援地方夏收的劳动日达二万七千多个。在农事季节较早的广东、福建等地，部队在夏收工作中都创立了新的功勋。驻海南岛某部指战员，和广大社员一起在时而烈日炙人，时而暴雨倾盆的日子里，抢收早稻，作到收细打净，颗粒归仓，丰产丰收。到福建龙溪平原、闽江上游和闽中地区支援夏收的战士，以“只争朝夕”的精神，连续作战，帮助农村人民公社夺得文化革命以来第一个好夏收。驻云南阿佤山区的某部指战员手持镰刀，背上背包，怀揣《毛主席语录》，开赴农业第一线以来，处处迎着困难，专抢重活干，使当地夏收、夏种取得全面胜利。刚完成支援地方运输任务返港的东海舰队三二二舰指战员，一靠码头，听说当地夏收已经开始，就不顾劳累，又开赴农村，支援夏收，广大贫下中农称赞他们不愧为人民的优秀子弟兵。
    广大指战员在支援夏收中，把宣传毛泽东思想当作对革命群众和干部最大、最根本的支援。他们在田头场地，同贫下中农和革命干部一起劳动，一起活学活用毛主席著作，向群众宣传党的方针政策，宣传无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利。有的部队还组织了演唱组、宣传队，运用各种文艺形式，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线；揭露党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。济南部队炮兵某部指战员，在农村劳动时，密切结合夏收中的实际情况，向群众宣传毛泽东思想。当发现有的人收割不够干净，就和社员一起学习毛主席有关勤俭建国的教导；当劳动较累的时候，就和社员一起高唱：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等毛主席语录歌。有的连队指战员，利用休息时间，在田头和社员、革命小将一起开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，交流学习心得，介绍学习经验，从而大大鼓舞了社员群众的革命积极性和生产积极性。
    在支援夏收中，广大指战员时刻保持高度的革命警惕，严防阶级敌人破坏夏收。他们利用劳动休息时间，同社员和民兵一起学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，提高广大群众和民兵的革命警惕性。许多部队还协同当地民兵，加强巡逻，保卫夏收。（附图片）
