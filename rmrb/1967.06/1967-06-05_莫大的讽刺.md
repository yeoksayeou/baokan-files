	The Great Irony

	“Let there be some vegetables on the table of the working people!”
	“There are no potatoes or pasta in the workers’ canteens; no meat and no canned fish….”
	These are the complaints of the Soviet people that have leaked out from the Soviet newspapers strictly controlled by the revisionist leadership. In recent years, the supply of agricultural products in the Soviet Union has been quite grim. The broad masses of the Soviet people not only rarely get to taste meat but also cannot even eat potatoes. This is a great irony for the so-called “communism of potatoes and beef” advocated by the Khrushchev revisionist clique!

	Who is to blame for this?

	This is the result of the full-scale restoration of capitalism in agriculture by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	The Soviet agriculture has taken the capitalist road of free operation, free competition, and profit-seeking, which has turned the “state farms” and “collective farms” into capitalist agricultural enterprises and kulak economies. The socialist planned economy is in name only, and the decline in production is inevitable. Take potatoes, for example. According to a recent report in the *Soviet Russia* newspaper, in the distribution plan for Russia, state farms only completed 85 percent, and collective farms only completed 74 percent. Another report states that last year's total potato production in the country only reached 59 percent of the 1965 target set in the seven-year plan. If calculated per capita, the ratio is even lower. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Soviet people often cannot eat potatoes.

	Of course, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk, along with the privileged stratum they represent, will not suffer such hardships. They live a life of extravagance and indulgence, having long grown tired of potatoes and beef. Their tables are filled with Australian turkeys, Italian asparagus, Scottish whisky... Whether the broad masses of the Soviet people can eat potatoes and vegetables is of no concern to them.

	In today's Soviet Union, class differentiation is accelerating, and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The “communism” boasted by the Soviet revisionist leadership is a “heaven” for a small handful of privileged strata and a “hell” for the broad masses of the Soviet people. The crux of the matter lies here.

    莫大的讽刺
    “让劳动人民的桌子上有些蔬菜吧！”
    “工人的食堂里没有土豆和通心粉；没有肉和罐头鱼……。”
    这是苏修领导集团严格控制的苏联报纸上泄漏出来的苏联劳动人民的几声怨言。近几年来，苏联农产品的供应情况十分不妙。广大的苏联人民不仅难以闻到肉味，而且连土豆也吃不上了。这对于赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团鼓吹的所谓“土豆烧牛肉的共产主义”，真是一个莫大的讽刺！
    孰令为之，孰令致之呢？
    这是苏修领导集团在农业中全面复辟资本主义的一个恶果。
    苏联农业走上自由经营、自由竞争、唯利是图的资本主义道路，这使“国营农场”和“集体农庄”蜕化为资本主义的农业企业和富农经济，社会主义的计划经济名存实亡，而生产下降，也就势所必然。就拿土豆来说，据《苏维埃俄罗斯报》不久以前报道说，在俄罗斯的分配计划，国营农场只完成了百分之八十五，集体农庄只完成了百分之七十四。另据报道，去年全国的土豆总产量，只达到七年计划中一九六五年的指标的百分之五十九。如按人口平均计算，则比率还要低得多。因此，苏联人民经常吃不上土豆，又有什么奇怪呢？
    当然，勃列日?夫、柯西金之流，以及他们所代表的特权阶层，是不会尝到这种苦头的。他们过着穷奢极欲的资产阶级生活，土豆烧牛肉早就吃厌了，他们的餐桌上有的是澳大利亚的火鸡、意大利的龙须菜、苏格兰的威士忌酒……苏联广大劳动人民吃不吃得上土豆和蔬菜，又同他们有什么相干？
    在今日之苏联，阶级加速分化，贫富悬殊的鸿沟日益加深。苏修领导集团所吹嘘的就是这样一种“共产主义”，它对一小撮特权阶层是“天堂”，对广大苏联人民则是地狱。问题的实质就在这里。
