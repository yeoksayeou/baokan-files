A Japanese youth begins a long march to protest Sato government's anti-China policy

A progressive Japanese youth, Hasegawa Tetsu, began a 1,100-kilometer march from Tokyo to Shimonoseki on June 10 to protest the Sato government's policy of following U.S. imperialism's "containment" of China and its refusal to issue travel permits for Japanese youth to participate in the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival scheduled to be held in China. In his call for the march, he strongly condemned the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and their followers, the Japan Communist Party revisionists, for colluding to oppose socialist China and undermine friendly relations between the youth and people of China and Japan.

Hasegawa Tetsu set out from Tokyo in the rain. A portrait of Chairman Mao was hung on his bicycle.

Boston blacks wage heroic struggle against police brutality

Early in June, some black women in Boston took to the streets to protest the city government's actions that harmed their welfare. However, the city government sent a large number of police to brutally suppress and arrest them and the black supporters.

Boston's blacks fought back heroically against the suppression. Over a thousand blacks, night after night, from rooftops, behind doors, and from alleyways, used stones, bricks, and bottles as weapons to engage in fierce battles with the police who came to suppress them. Some blacks also fired back at the police. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
