Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: We must conduct meticulous political and ideological work even with groups of the masses that are conservative, and even with reactionary organizations. This is the glorious task entrusted by Chairman Mao to the proletarian revolutionary masses, embodying the great leader's affectionate concern and boundless trust for the broad masses. Every proletarian revolutionary cadre must resolutely and unconditionally execute this great directive.

One of the consequences of the capitalist roaders in power within the Party pushing the reactionary bourgeois line is the severe antagonism it has created among the masses. They incite a portion of the misled masses to oppose the proletarian revolutionary masses, hoping that the two sides will fight each other more fiercely, thus resisting the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle to seize power. To overthrow the capitalist roaders in power within the Party and to achieve the broadest revolutionary alliance with the leftists as the core, the proletarian revolutionary masses must liberate the misled masses from the spiritual shackles of the reactionary bourgeois line. Contesting with the bourgeoisie for the masses is an important task in the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle to seize and hold power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all of humanity. This fundamental Marxist principle is our starting point for correctly handling the misled masses.

To correctly handle the misled masses, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in and relying on the masses. Chairman Mao has always taught us: We must firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good, and that the bad elements are very few. We must not only believe in the masses who support us but also in those who have opposed us and who, as proven by practice, have been wrong in their opposition. We must believe that the vast majority of the misled masses are also revolutionary, that their fundamental interests are the same as ours, and that our common enemy is the same. As long as we persist in the policy of "unity—criticism—unity" and persist in conducting meticulous political and ideological work, we will surely complete the arduous task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao of uniting with the majority and striking at the few. Whether the proletarian revolutionary masses are in a position of strength or in a temporary position of weakness, they should actively undertake this important work, winning over the misled masses to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and learning to master the solid skills of mass work.

To this end, the proletarian revolutionary masses should do the following: grasp the direction of the struggle, fully promote democracy, learn to address living thoughts, and dare to engage in self-criticism.

First, grasp the direction of the struggle. The decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao, the "Sixteen Points," points out: "The key to this movement is to criticize those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." We must recognize this main enemy and grasp this principal contradiction, absolutely not directing the spearhead of the struggle against the misled masses.

Currently, in some places, there is indeed a small handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party who are secretly plotting and inciting a portion of the conservative masses to oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, oppose the proletarian headquarters, and even resort to armed struggle, attacking the proletarian revolutionary masses. However, in such cases, we must also distinguish between the vast majority of the misled masses and the few bad elements, thoroughly exposing the crimes of the few bad elements and their behind-the-scenes manipulators, and educating and winning over the misled masses. Experience has shown that wherever this is done, it greatly accelerates the victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle to seize power.

Second, fully promote democracy. In places where the proletarian revolutionary masses are in power, for the masses who hold different opinions, including the misled masses, we must treat them equally and give them full democratic rights. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must learn to overcome various erroneous ideas through the method of debate and reasoning." We must allow people to make mistakes and also allow them to correct their mistakes. We must allow people to make mistakes again and also allow them to correct their mistakes again. If we do not allow people to speak, arbitrarily label them, and suppress them with force, we will deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and will not be able to unite with the vast majority of the masses.

Third, learn to address living thoughts. We must learn through various methods to bring the warmth of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to the misled masses. We must deeply understand their living thoughts, speak to their hearts, and make them convinced and enlightened. Chairman Mao recently pointed out that conducting heart-to-heart talks is a very good method. Proactively seeking out the misled masses for heart-to-heart talks, arousing their class consciousness, is not "rightist" or "lowly," but a manifestation of adhering to the principles of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Lenin said well: "Where there are masses, we must go to work there." If we refuse to do meticulous political and ideological work for our class brothers, abandoning the important position of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, this is an unprincipled act.

Fourth, dare to engage in self-criticism. Chairman Mao said: "Whether or not there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent features that distinguish us from other parties." True proletarian revolutionaries welcome criticism from all sides, dare to publicly admit and correct their shortcomings and mistakes, and set an example everywhere, strictly demanding of themselves. In this way, they will gain the trust and support of the broad masses. Affirming everything and covering up mistakes is not the scientific attitude of a proletarian revolutionary.

We must thoroughly implement the important principle of "revolution has no precedence." The view that only those who "revolted first" are true revolutionaries and that those who "revolted later" are opportunists, and the view that the misled masses are all "old conservatives" and "cultivationists," are all idealistic and metaphysical and are wrong. The glory of "revolting first" lies in their greater responsibility to unite with and educate the backward masses. As long as the misled masses in the originally conservative organizations revolt, change their political direction, turn their weapons against the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party, we must welcome them, not discriminate against them; support them, not oppose them; unite with them, not exclude them.

The misled masses should not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for you. You should humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionary masses, actively align yourselves with the proletarian revolutionary masses, and change your stance. If you remain unyielding and even insist on your mistakes when our Party emphasizes correctly handling the misled masses, denying the correct direction of the proletarian revolutionary masses, you will sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the reactionary bourgeois line, which is very dangerous. If you are wrong, you are wrong. You must dare to admit your mistakes, dare to touch your soul, and dare to revolt against the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party.

It should also be pointed out that in some places, the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party are spreading rumors and maliciously sowing discord among the misled masses, saying, "You have been labeled as counter-revolutionaries and must fight to the death with them." Their purpose is to incite these masses to continue opposing the proletarian revolutionary masses. Be very careful, do not be deceived. Bowing to the truth and admitting defeat may be cursed by some as "betrayal," but from the standpoint of the proletarian revolutionary cause, this is glory, not disgrace, progress, not retreat. Lenin said, "A slave who is aware of his slave status and struggles against it is a revolutionary." Comrades who are still misled should thoroughly smash the ideology of slavery and all become such revolutionaries.

The proletarian revolutionary masses correctly handling the misled masses has made the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party and the few leaders of conservative organizations greatly panic. They cry out: "You are undermining our foundations." Gentlemen, you are right, we are indeed undermining your foundations. Once the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the hearts of the masses temporarily misled by you, your "walls" built on lies and deception will collapse completely, and your doomsday will arrive!

    正确对待受蒙蔽的群众	任立新
    最近，我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：对有群众的保守组织，甚至反动组织，也要进行细致的政治思想工作。这是毛主席交给无产阶级革命派的光荣任务，体现了伟大领袖对广大群众的亲切关怀和无限信赖。每一个无产阶级革命派战士，都要坚决地、不折不扣地执行这一伟大指示。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行资产阶级反动路线的恶果之一，就是造成群众之间的严重对立。他们挑动一部分受蒙蔽的群众同无产阶级革命派对抗，而且希望两派之间打得越凶越好，以抗拒无产阶级革命派向他们夺权的斗争。无产阶级革命派要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，要实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，就必须把受蒙蔽的群众从资产阶级反动路线的精神枷锁下解放出来。同资产阶级争夺群众，是无产阶级革命派夺权和掌权斗争中的重要任务。
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己。这个马克思主义的根本原理，是我们正确对待受蒙蔽群众的出发点。
    正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，就要牢记毛主席关于相信和依靠群众的教导。毛主席历来教导我们：要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数。我们不仅要相信那些拥护自己的群众，还要相信那些反对过自己，并且已被实践证明是反对错了的群众。要相信受蒙蔽的群众的绝大多数也是要革命的，他们和我们的根本利益是一致的，敌人是共同的。只要我们坚持“团结——批评——团结”的方针，坚持进行细致的政治思想工作，我们就一定能胜利完成毛主席交给我们的团结大多数，打击一小撮的艰巨任务。无产阶级革命派，无论处于优势的地位，还是处于暂时劣势的地位，都应该主动地进行这项重要工作，把受蒙蔽的群众争取到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，学会做群众工作的过硬本领。
    为此，无产阶级革命派应当做到：掌握斗争方向，充分发扬民主，学会抓活思想，勇于自我批评。
    第一，掌握斗争方向。毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，即“十六条”指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”我们必须认清这个主要敌人，抓住这个主要矛盾，绝不能把斗争的矛头指向受蒙蔽的群众。
      目前，在有些地方，确实还有一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派幕后策划，挑动一部分保守派的群众，对抗无产阶级文化大革命，对抗无产阶级司令部，甚至不惜挑起武斗，打击无产阶级革命派。但是，对于这种情况，我们也一定要把其中绝大多数受蒙蔽的群众和极少数坏人区别开来，彻底揭露极少数坏人及其幕后操纵者的罪行，教育和争取受蒙蔽的群众。经验证明，凡是这样做的地方，都大大加速了无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利。
    第二，充分发扬民主。在无产阶级革命派掌权的地方，对持有不同意见的群众，包括受蒙蔽的群众，要一视同仁，给予充分的民主权利。要遵照毛主席的教导：“我们一定要学会通过辩论的方法、说理的方法，来克服各种错误思想。”允许人家犯错误，也允许人家改正错误。允许人家再犯错误，也还要允许人家再改正错误。如果不让人家讲话，动不动就“无限上纲”，乱扣帽子，以势压人，那就会背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不可能团结最大多数的群众。
    第三，学会抓活思想。我们一定要学会通过各种方法，把毛泽东思想，把党的政策的温暖，带给受蒙蔽的群众。要深入了解他们的活思想，把话说到他们的心坎上，使他们心服口服，一通百通。毛主席最近指出，开展谈心活动，这个方法很好。主动找受蒙蔽的群众谈心，启发他们的阶级觉悟，这样做，并不是“右倾”，不是“低三下四”，而是坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线原则性的表现。列宁说得好：“哪里有群众，就一定到哪里去工作。”如果，拒绝对自己的阶级弟兄做细致的政治思想工作，放弃宣传毛泽东思想的重要阵地，这才是无原则的表现。
    第四，勇于自我批评。毛主席说：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”真正的无产阶级革命派，最欢迎来自各方面的批评，勇于公开承认和改正自己的缺点和错误，处处以身作则，严格要求自己。这样，就更赢得了广大群众的信任和拥护。肯定一切，文过饰非，绝不是无产阶级革命者的科学态度。
    我们必须切实贯彻“革命不分先后”这个重要的原则。那种认为只有“先革命”才是真革命，“后造反”就是“投机”的观点，那种认为受蒙蔽的群众都是“老保”“修养派”的观点，都是唯心主义和形而上学的，是错误的。“先革命”的光荣，正在于他们负有团结和教育落后群众的更大责任。原来保守的组织，只要受蒙蔽的群众起来造反，扭转了政治方向，反戈一击，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们就要欢迎，不应歧视；就要支持，不应反对；就要联合，不应排斥。
    受蒙蔽的群众，不应当辜负毛主席对你们的期望。要虚心向无产阶级革命派学习，主动地向无产阶级革命派靠拢，把立场转过来。如果总是不服气，甚至在我们党强调正确对待受蒙蔽群众的时候，还坚持错误，否定无产阶级革命派的大方向，那就会在资产阶级反动路线的泥坑里越陷越深，这是很危险的。自己大方向错了就是错了，要勇于认错，勇于触及灵魂，勇于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。
    还应当指出，有些地方，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派正在受蒙蔽的群众当中散布流言蜚语，恶毒地挑拨离间，说什么“你们被打成反革命了，必须同他们拚到底”。其目的，就是要挑动这些群众继续同无产阶级革命派相对抗。千万注意，不要上当。向真理低头服输，也许会被某些人骂为“背叛”，但是，站在无产阶级革命立场上来看，这是光荣而不是耻辱，是前进而不是倒退。列宁说过，“意识到自己的奴隶地位而与之作斗争的奴隶，是革命家。”还在受蒙蔽的同志，应当彻底粉碎奴隶主义，都来做这样的革命家。
    无产阶级革命派正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和极少数保守组织的头头大为恐慌。他们惊呼：“你们挖墙脚。”先生们，你们说对了，我们就是要挖你们的墙脚。毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光一旦照亮被你们暂时蒙蔽的群众的心坎，你们那建筑在谎言和欺骗基础上的“墙”，就会彻底坍塌，你们的末日就要到来！
