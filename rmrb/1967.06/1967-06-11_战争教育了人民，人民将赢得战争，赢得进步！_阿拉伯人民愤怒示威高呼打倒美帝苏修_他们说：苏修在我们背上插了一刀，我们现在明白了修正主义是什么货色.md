War educates the people, the people will win the war and achieve progress!

Arab people take to the streets in anger, shouting down the American and Soviet revisionists

They say: The Soviet revisionists stabbed us in the back, now we know what revisionism is!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, the broad masses of the Arab countries, who have suffered aggression from the United States, Britain, and Israel and been betrayed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, are filled with indignation and fighting spirit. In recent days, they have held increasingly large-scale demonstrations, denouncing American and British imperialism and Soviet revisionism, expressing the Arab people's determination to continue the anti-aggression struggle to the end.

In the capital of the United Arab Republic, Cairo, the streets are filled with demonstrators. People angrily shout: "Down with Johnson!" "Down with Wilson!" "Down with Kosygin!" "We demand to go to the front!" "We want to fight!" The entire city has become a roaring sea. Workers and students from the suburbs of Cairo and other cities flock to Cairo in batches, either by car or on foot, to participate in the demonstrations. They express their firm resolve to resist aggression in various ways. Amidst the anti-imperialist cries, Americans residing in Cairo are hurriedly leaving. The tide of opposition to the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the Arab people is surging in Cairo. Batch after batch of demonstrators gather in front of the Soviet embassy. On the night of the 9th alone, three groups of demonstrators attempted to break through the walls of the Soviet embassy and rush into the embassy.

In the heroic city of Port Said, the masses held another large-scale demonstration on the 10th, condemning the aggressive war in which the American imperialists participated. They once again set fire to the British consulate and the American library there.

In Algeria, many places across the country held spirited rallies and demonstrations on the 9th. In the capital, Algiers, several thousand demonstrators spontaneously gathered and marched to the Soviet cultural center in Algiers, angrily and rhythmically shouting slogans: "Down with American imperialism!" "Johnson is a murderer!" "The Soviet Union is a traitor!" "Kosygin, go to the garbage dump!" Thousands more marched to the location of the Algerian Ministry of Defense, demanding that the government issue weapons and shouting: "The war has just begun!" "We will fight to the last drop of blood!" A group of demonstrators, as they passed by the gate of the Chinese Embassy in Algeria, eagerly asked the embassy staff for "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao badges, and Mao photographs. They repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese people!" "China is with us!"

Since the exposure of the Soviet revisionists' despicable conspiracy with the United States and Britain in the Security Council to draft a "ceasefire resolution," more and more Algerian people have recognized the true face of the Soviet revisionists' fake support and real betrayal. Some people said: "Now we know what revisionism is! The Soviet revisionists are just as much a bunch of scoundrels as the Americans. They issued eloquent statements, saying they would support the Arabs, but when the American imperialists and Israel launched the aggression, they did not move a muscle. They not only did not help us, but they also forced the Arabs to stop fighting. They stabbed us in the back!"

An old warrior's words expressed the Algerian people's determination to fight to the end. He said: "For me, the war has just begun. We will fight to the last person! We Arabs have one hundred million people, we can win this war. Fighting is not about weapons, but about the will of the people and their confidence."

In the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, about three thousand people held a grand demonstration on the 9th. When the procession reached the gate of the United Arab Republic embassy, people shouted slogans: "Down with America!" "Down with Kosygin!" "Break off relations with the Soviet Union!" A UAR diplomatic official received the demonstrators and told them that the Soviet revisionist leadership had betrayed the UAR. At this, the demonstrators angrily shouted: "Down with the traitor Kosygin!" "Smash the Soviet embassy!"

In the capital of Lebanon, Beirut, thousands of Lebanese residents held a demonstration on the 10th, shouting slogans against imperialist aggression and the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of Arab people's interests. The angry crowd set fire to some shops run by Americans and British in Beirut and attacked the Soviet embassy in Beirut.

In Mauritania, the people held demonstrations in front of the Soviet embassy in Nouakchott on the 9th and 10th, with demonstrators shouting slogans against Soviet revisionism.

    战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争，赢得进步！
    阿拉伯人民愤怒示威高呼打倒美帝苏修
    他们说：苏修在我们背上插了一刀，我们现在明白了修正主义是什么货色
    据新华社十日讯　遭到美、英、以三国侵略和被苏修领导集团叛卖的阿拉伯国家广大人民，群情激愤，斗志昂扬，连日来举行了规模愈来愈大的示威，声讨美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义，表达了阿拉伯人民要把反侵略斗争进行到底的决心。
    在阿联首都开罗，大街小巷，到处是示威的人群，人们愤怒地高呼：“打倒约翰逊！”“打倒威尔逊！”“打倒柯西金！”“我们要求到前线去！”“我们要战斗！”整个城市已经成了咆啸的海洋。居住在开罗郊区和其它城市的工人、学生成批成批地坐车或步行赶到开罗，参加示威游行。他们用各种方式表达他们坚决反抗侵略的决心。在一片反帝声中，居住在阿联的美国人正在紧张地撤离开罗。反对苏修领导集团出卖阿拉伯人民的浪潮在开罗也空前地高涨。大批大批的示威群众到苏联大使馆前示威。仅九日晚，就有三批示威者想要突破苏联大使馆的围墙，冲进使馆。
    在英雄的塞得港，群众在十日再次举行大规模示威，谴责美帝国主义参与的侵略战争。他们再次放火烧了那里的英国领事馆和美国图书馆。
    在阿尔及利亚，全国许多地方在九日都举行了斗志昂扬的集会和示威游行。在首都阿尔及尔，有好几千名示威者，自发地集合在一起，游行到苏联设在阿尔及尔的文化中心愤怒地和有节奏地高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义！”“约翰逊是杀人犯！”“苏联是叛徒！”“柯西金滚进垃圾堆里去！”还有数以千计的人游行到阿尔及利亚国防部所在地，他们要求政府发给武器，并且高呼：“战争只是刚开始！”“我们将斗争到流尽最后一滴血！”有一批游行示威的队伍在走过中国驻阿尔及利亚大使馆旁门的时候，争先恐后地向大使馆工作人员要《毛主席语录》、毛主席像章和毛主席照片。他们不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”“中国同我们在一起！”
    自苏修伙同美英在安理会炮制“停火决议”的卑鄙阴谋暴露后，愈来愈多的阿尔及利亚人民认识到苏修假支持、真出卖的面目。有的人说：“我们现在明白了修正主义是什么货色！苏联修正主义者同美国佬一样是一群混蛋。他们发表了娓娓动听的声明，说什么要支持阿拉伯人，但是一旦美帝国主义者和以色列发动侵略，他们却一动也不动了。他们非但不援助我们，反而强迫我们阿拉伯人停火。他们在我们背上插了一刀！”
    一位老战士说的话表达了阿尔及利亚人民把斗争进行到底的意志。他说：“对于我来说，战争刚刚开始。我们要战斗到最后一个人！我们阿拉伯有一亿人口，我们能够打赢这场战争。打仗不是靠武器，而是取决于人心所向和信心。”
    在苏丹首都喀土穆，约有三千人在九日举行了盛大的示威游行。当游行队伍到达阿联大使馆门前时，人们高呼口号：“打倒美国！”“打倒柯西金！”“同苏联绝交！”一名阿联外交官员接见了示威的群众，并且告诉他们，苏联修正主义领导集团出卖了阿联。这时，示威群众激愤地高呼：“打倒柯西金这个叛徒！”“砸掉苏联大使馆！”
    在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特，数千名黎巴嫩居民十日举行示威游行，高呼反对帝国主义侵略和苏修出卖阿拉伯人民利益的口号。愤怒的群众放火焚烧美国人和英国人在贝鲁特经营的一些商店，并且袭击了苏联驻贝鲁特的大使馆。
    在毛里塔尼亚，人民九日和十日接连在苏联驻努瓦克肖特大使馆面前举行示威游行，示威者高呼反对苏联修正主义的口号。
