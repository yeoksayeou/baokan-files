	The great victory of Mao Zedong Thought: The splendid achievements of the Cultural Revolution

	China's mastery of the hydrogen bomb inspires the revolutionary people of the world and makes the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries extremely fearful

	New China News Agency, June 24th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China received a telegram from the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party congratulating the successful explosion of our hydrogen bomb. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Dear Comrades:

	The People's Republic of China successfully exploded its first hydrogen bomb on June 17, 1967. The Burmese Communist Party and all the people of Burma express their warm congratulations on this victory.

	This victory is a leap forward in China's development of nuclear weapons, marking the beginning of a completely new stage.

	This victory, which makes the Chinese people and people all over the world feel especially proud, is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, another brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fruit of the victory over the revisionist line of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, by firmly adhering to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

	The People's Republic of China's mastery of the hydrogen bomb greatly inspires the revolutionary people of the world, while the imperialists headed by U.S. imperialism, the modern revisionists headed by Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are extremely fearful.

	The success of China's hydrogen bomb test has once again broken the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

	This victory is a great support for the Vietnamese people in their heroic and glorious struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for national liberation and people's democracy, for the Arab people who are fighting against the aggression of U.S.-British imperialism and its lackey, the Israeli reactionary regime, and for the people of the world.

	The outcome of a war is determined not by weapons but by people. The People's Republic of China, based on this view, has conducted necessary and limited nuclear tests and developed nuclear weapons. China does this only to defend its country, and the ultimate goal is to destroy nuclear weapons. The Chinese people possess nuclear weapons not for military aggression but to ensure genuine world peace. Therefore, we fully support China's actions.

	Comrades, for this great achievement, the Burmese Communist Party extends warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the soldiers, workers, technicians, scientists, and all relevant personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who participated in the hydrogen bomb explosion test.

	For the benefit of the Chinese people and the people of the world, we wish you new achievements.

	Long live the great Communist Party of China!

	Long live Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Down with modern revisionism! Long live the unity of our two parties and our two peoples!

	With communist greetings!

	Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party
	June 18, 1967

    缅共中央致电中共中央热烈祝贺我氢弹爆炸成功
    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利  文化大革命的辉煌成果
    中国掌握氢弹鼓舞全世界革命人民使帝修反非常恐惧
    新华社二十四日讯　中共中央收到了缅甸共产党中央委员会发来的祝贺我国氢弹爆炸成功的电报。贺电全文如下：北京中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    中华人民共和国在一九六七年六月十七日成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹，缅甸共产党和全体缅甸人民对此表示热烈祝贺。
    这个胜利是中国发展核武器的一个飞跃，标志着它已经进入到完全崭新的阶段。
    中国人民和全世界人民都感到特别自豪的这个胜利，是毛泽东思想的又一个伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一个光辉的胜利，是坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对和战胜党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义路线的胜利果实。
    中华人民共和国掌握氢弹，全世界革命人民都感到非常鼓舞，以美帝为首的帝国主义者、以苏联修正主义为首的现代修正主义者和各国反动派却感到非常恐惧。
    中国氢弹试验的成功，再一次打破了美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的核垄断。
    这个胜利，对于越南人民正在进行的英勇的光荣的抗美救国战争，对于正在为民族解放和人民民主而斗争的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，对于正在为反对美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列反动派的侵略而进行斗争的阿拉伯人民，对于全世界人民是一个极为巨大的支持。
    决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是人。中华人民共和国根据这个观点，进行了必要的和有限制的核试验，发展了核武器。中国这样做，仅仅是为了保卫国家，最终目的是为了销毁核武器。中国人民拥有核武器，不是为了进行军事侵略，而是为了保证真正的世界和平。因此，我们完全支持中国的行动。
    同志们，为了这个伟大的成就，缅甸共产党向你们，并通过你们向参加氢弹爆炸试验的中国人民解放军指战员、工人、技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员致以热烈的祝贺。
    为了中国人民和世界人民的利益，祝你们取得更新的成绩。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万岁！打倒现代修正主义！我们两党和两国人民的团结万岁！
    致以共产主义敬礼！缅甸共产党中央委员会
  一九六七年六月十八日
