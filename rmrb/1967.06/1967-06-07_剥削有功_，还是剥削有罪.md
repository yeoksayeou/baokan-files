Whether it is the workers who create social wealth and support the capitalists, or the capitalists who exploit and oppress the workers to amass wealth, this is a question that the founders of Marxism have long resolved. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, driven by the reactionary need to restore capitalism, has once again dug up the rotten goods from the reactionary theoretical arsenal of the bourgeoisie, vigorously promoting the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is a merit." The reactionary films "City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" were made in accordance with the intentions of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. These two films blatantly stand on the reactionary bourgeois stance, maliciously distort history, and vigorously glorify the bourgeoisie, openly advocating for the unification of workers and capitalists, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Marx said: "Capital comes into the world dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt." "Without killing the poor, one cannot make a fortune," this is the way the bourgeoisie amasses wealth. The reactionary films "Lin's Shop" and "City That Never Sleeps" vigorously glorify the bourgeoisie, covering up their savage exploitative nature. The former emphasizes Lin's hard work, thrift, and hard-earned business; the latter openly uses the words of Zhang Bo Han's father and son to describe their bloody history of amassing wealth as a result of apprentices "enduring hardships for decades" and "spending half their lives" to "build up this little business." They create these lies to make people believe: capitalists become capitalists, and their capital grows from nothing to something, not because of exploitation, but because they are "hardworking" and "thrifty." In short, capitalists are said to have "started from hard work and thrift."

"City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" further vigorously promote the shameless lie of "capitalists supporting workers." When workers rise up to struggle against capitalists, the directors of the reactionary film "City That Never Sleeps" actually let the capitalists threaten the workers not to "drive the factory to bankruptcy," which would be bad for everyone. In "Lin's Shop," as long as the shop can continue to operate, the employees and workers like Zhang's widow follow Lin's lead and live well. Once Lin's Shop goes bankrupt and Lin collapses, "when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter," they all have no way to live. Even more vile is that "Lin's Shop" actually lets the poor farmer Lao Tongbao, with gratitude, say to the capitalist: "If you talk about how Lin treats me, there is nothing to say," "If he opens a grain shop, I would have already been in heaven." It seems that the capitalist's prosperous days are the days when the working people ascend to heaven. These two reactionary films unify the interests of the two opposing classes, dress up the capitalists as representatives of the "people's interests," and attribute the workers' suffering to the factory's decline and the shop's bankruptcy, blatantly covering up the fact that the evil system of exploitation is the true source of the workers' miserable lives, thus preparing revolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The roots of the reactionary films "City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" selling the revolutionary black goods of "capitalists supporting workers" are all from the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, before and after liberation, spread the fallacies of "exploitation is a merit" and "exploitation is serving the people" everywhere. He maliciously distorts the great image of the working class, using the most servile tone, begging the capitalists: "Capitalist sir, we ask you to exploit us a bit... exploit us a bit, and I will have food to eat, and my wife and children will be able to live. If you don't exploit... then it will be terrible." In his view, capitalists are the "saviors" of workers, and without capitalists, workers cannot live for a single day. Look, how shameless and arrogant the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is in glorifying capitalists and promoting "exploitation is a merit"!

"City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" vigorously glorify the bourgeoisie, openly plead for the bourgeoisie, and madly call for the restoration of the bourgeoisie who have been deprived of the means of production. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan clearly states in the "Editor's Note" of "Lin's Shop": his purpose of rewriting is to let the capitalists use the method of "comparing the past and present" and "remembering bitterness and thinking sweetness" to recall the "bitter era" thirty years ago when "they could not control their own destiny." What a good "comparison of the past and present," this is not calling the capitalists to yearn for the "heaven" they have lost! What a good era of capitalists "controlling their own destiny," this is not calling the capitalists to restore the old society!

"City That Never Sleeps" uses the mouth of the filial and virtuous son of the exploiting class, Zhang Wenxuan, to lament: "You don't know, the word 'exploiting class' weighs heavily on one's heart." Zhang Bo Han is even more madly shouting: "Are we to bear this stigma of the exploiting class forever?" As if the stigma of the "exploiting class" has caused the capitalists great injustice. This is not hatred for the dictatorship of the proletariat, what is it! The filmmakers and who are breathing from the same nostril, speaking for which class, is it not very clear?

What is clearly ruthless exploitation is said to be "enduring hardships" and "hard work and thrift"; what is clearly a bloody history of exploitation is called "starting from hard work"; what is clearly workers supporting capitalists is said to be capitalists supporting workers. The capitalist blowhards—the makers of "City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" and the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party who supports them behind the scenes—have gone mad in their efforts to restore capitalism, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, and glorifying the bourgeoisie and the capitalist exploitation system in every possible way.

### “剥削有功”，还是剥削有罪

    “剥削有功”，还是剥削有罪
    师红潮
    究竟是创造社会财富的工人养活资本家，还是靠压迫、剥削工人发家致富的资本家养活工人，这是马克思主义创始人早已解决了的问题。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派出于复辟资本主义的反动需要，重新搬出了资产阶级反动理论武库中“资本家养活工人”的破烂货色，大肆宣扬“剥削有功”的反动谬论。反动影片《不夜城》、《林家铺子》，就是秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的意旨拍制的。这两部影片公然站在反动的资产阶级立场上，恶意歪曲历史，极力美化资产阶级，明目张胆地鼓吹工人与资本家“合二而一”，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。
    马克思说：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”“杀不了穷人发不了家”，这就是资产阶级的发家之道。反动影片《林家铺子》、《不夜城》却极力美化资产阶级，掩盖他们凶残的剥削阶级本质。前者大力渲染林老板的勤劳节俭，惨淡经营；后者公开借张伯韩父子之口，把他们血腥的发家史，说成是由学徒“吃辛吃苦几十年”，“花了半生的心血”，“才撑起了这点家业”。它们制造这些谎言，企图使人们相信：资本家之所以成为资本家，他们的资本之所以能从无到有，从小到大，不是由于剥削，而是因为他们能“勤劳”、会“节俭”。一句话，资本家是靠所谓“勤俭起家”的。
    《不夜城》和《林家铺子》还进一步大肆宣扬“资本家养活工人”的无耻谰言。当工人起来向资本家斗争的时候，反动影片《不夜城》的编导者竟然让资本家用威胁的口吻警告工人不要“逼倒了”这个厂，这对“大家都没有好处”。在《林家铺子》里，当这家铺子还能经营下去时，店员工人与张寡妇们都跟随林老板生活得很好，一旦林家铺子倒闭了，林老板垮台了，“树倒猢狲散”，他们都没有办法活下去了。更恶毒的是《林家铺子》竟借贫苦农民老通宝之口对资本家感恩戴德地说：“要说林老板待我呀，那可真是没有说的”，“他要是开粮店，我早就阿弥陀佛了”。仿佛资本家的升平之日，就是劳动人民登天堂之时。这两部反动影片把两个敌对阶级的利益“合二而一”，把资本家打扮成“全民利益”的代表，把工人的痛苦归结为工厂的不景气、铺子的倒闭造成的，公然掩盖万恶的剥削制度是造成工人阶级痛苦生活的真正根源，从而为实现资本主义复辟准备反革命的舆论。
    树有根水有源。反动影片《不夜城》、《林家铺子》所贩卖的“资本家养活工人”的反革命黑货，正是从党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派那里批发来的。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在解放前后，到处散布“剥削有功”、“剥削就是为人民服务”的谬论。他恶毒歪曲工人阶级的伟大形象，用十足的奴才腔调，向资本家摇尾乞怜：“资本家先生，我们请你剥削一下……剥削一下，我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去。如果不剥削……那就不得了。”在他看来，资本家是工人的“救命恩人”，没有资本家，工人一天也活不下去。请看，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派美化资本家，鼓吹“剥削有功”，是何等的无耻，何等的嚣张！
    《不夜城》、《林家铺子》极力美化资产阶级，公然为资产阶级鸣冤叫屈，疯狂为被剥夺了生产资料的资产阶级呼喊复辟。反革命修正主义分子夏衍在《林家铺子》“改编者言”里说得很清楚，他改编的目的就是要让资本家用“今昔对比”、“忆苦思甜”的方法，去回忆三十年前“自己不能掌握自己命运”的“苦难时代”。好一个“今昔对比”，这不是叫资本家留恋他们失去的“天堂”又是什么！好一个资本家“掌握自己命运”的时代，这不是叫资本家搞复辟又是什么！
    《不夜城》借剥削阶级的孝子贤孙张文琤之口悲愤哭诉：“你不知道，剥削阶级这个字眼压在人心里有多沉。”张伯韩更是发疯般地狂叫：“难道我们就永远背着这个剥削阶级的臭名声吗？”好象“剥削阶级”的臭名声使资本家受到了天大的委屈。这不是对无产阶级专政的仇恨是什么！影片的炮制者和谁一个鼻孔出气，在为那个阶级说话，难道还不十分清楚吗？
    明明是残酷的剥削，却说成是“吃辛吃苦”、“勤劳节俭”；明明是一部血淋淋的剥削罪恶史，却美其名曰“勤劳起家”；明明是工人养活了资本家，却说成是资本家养活了工人。资本主义的吹鼓手们——《不夜城》、《林家铺子》的炮制者以及背后支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，为了复辟资本主义，极力制造反革命舆论，百般美化资产阶级和资本主义剥削制度，已到了丧心病狂的地步。
