According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 9th. According to the June 8th report from the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," the representative of the East China branch of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Matsuoka Takeichiro, the leader of the Japan-China Friendship Trade Delegation, spoke to reporters from the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" at Kai Tak Airport on the afternoon of June 7th before departing for Japan. He praised and supported the Hong Kong compatriots who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely counterattacking the provocations of British imperialism. He said that the fearless, self-sacrificing, and unyielding revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people in Hong Kong has shaken the world.

Matsuoka Takeichiro said that the brave struggle of the Chinese people in Hong Kong has great significance for the revolutionary struggles of the people in Asia and other parts of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. It plays a tremendous inspiring role in the liberation struggle of oppressed nations and peoples. He firmly believes that the Chinese people will be victorious, and the British authorities in Hong Kong will surely meet a miserable end.

He pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong's bloody suppression of the Chinese people is a major exposure of the anti-China conspiracy between British imperialism and American imperialism. British imperialism has turned Hong Kong into a military base for American imperialism to expand the Vietnam War and attack China. Today, China is no longer the China of 17 years ago; the Chinese people have long since stood up. The Chinese people will absolutely not allow British imperialism to do as it pleases at China's southern gate. If British imperialism misjudges the situation in China, it will surely reap what it sows.

    松冈武一郎赞扬我港胞反迫害斗争
    香港中国人民的革命精神震动全世界
    据新华社香港九日电  据香港《大公报》八日报道，日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局访华友好商社代表团团长松冈武一郎，七日下午过港回国前，在香港启德机场对香港《大公报》记者发表谈话，赞扬和支持我香港爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅。他说，香港中国人民不怕牺牲，前赴后继的革命精神，已震动全世界。
    松冈武一郎说，香港中国人民这一场英勇斗争，对亚洲及世界各地革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的革命斗争具有重大意义，对被压迫民族和被压迫人民翻身求解放起着极大的鼓舞作用。他坚信，中国人民必胜，香港英国当局一定要落个悲惨的下场。
    他指出，香港英国当局对中国人民的血腥镇压，是英帝国主义勾结美帝国主义进行反华阴谋的大暴露。英帝国主义竟把香港作为美帝国主义扩大侵越战争和进攻中国的军事基地。今天，中国已不是十七年前的中国，中国人民早已站起来了，中国人民绝对不容许英帝国主义在中国的南方大门为所欲为。如果英帝国主义对中国形势作出错误的估计，英帝国主义必将自食恶果。
