Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not only unite with those who agree with us, but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us. Furthermore, we must be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice."

The proletarian revolutionary faction must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and be good at uniting the majority of the masses. Within the revolutionary ranks, even those who have opposed us, we must be good at uniting with them to work together.

In our school, there is a story that has been circulating: There was a student who was once a leader of the Jinggangshan Red Guards. Due to his severe anarchism, he once withdrew from Jinggangshan. After criticism and self-criticism, he recognized his errors and returned to Jinggangshan, and was accepted to participate in the work. Recently, the main leaders of Jinggangshan even proposed to include him in the revolutionary committee.

The matter is quite ordinary, but to do this is not an easy thing. Some comrades cannot understand: This student made mistakes, and yet we want him to return to the revolutionary organization, where is the principle? Isn't this a case of merging two into one?

In fact, the opposite is true. This action precisely embodies an important principle.

Just like any other matter in the world, there are contradictions and struggles within the revolutionary ranks. This is a normal phenomenon. As long as there are contradictions and struggles, there will be those who support us and those who oppose us.

However, our principle is not based on whether someone supports or opposes us. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All words and actions of a Communist must conform to the highest interests of the broadest masses of the people and must be approved by them." Only the fundamental interests of the proletarian revolution are the highest criterion for all our actions. If we deviate from this, even for those who supposedly "support" us, we cannot talk about unity with them. On the contrary, as long as it does not violate the fundamental interests of the proletarian revolution, we should unite with those who have opposed us to work together. Although this student opposed Jinggangshan in some aspects, it was a mistake, but he is not an enemy of Jinggangshan. Fundamentally, he is in agreement with Jinggangshan. He shares a common enemy with Jinggangshan—the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Uniting to overthrow the common enemy is the fundamental interest of the proletarian revolution, and this is the principle.

Principles have always been class principles. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the highest embodiment of the interests of the Chinese proletariat and the laboring people. To support Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the highest principle of the revolution. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line requires us to believe in the majority of the masses at all times. We must see that the vast majority of the masses support Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Some comrades, due to being temporarily deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, joined the wrong side and made mistakes, but after education, they can become enlightened and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Merely seeing that someone has opposed us and not believing that they are revolutionary, treating them as enemies, and excluding them from the revolutionary ranks, this goes against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and fundamentally deviates from the proletarian revolutionary principle. Allowing this student to return to Jinggangshan, uniting with him to work together, giving him the opportunity to correct his mistakes, and allowing him to be revolutionary, this is precisely a manifestation of believing in the masses, which is what Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line requires, and a manifestation of upholding the proletarian revolutionary principle.

Some comrades cannot bear to hear opposing opinions. As soon as they hear opposing opinions, they turn hostile, and even roll up their sleeves and clench their fists, let alone unite with those who have opposed us to work together. This is wrong. These comrades do not understand that we ourselves are not one hundred percent correct, not one hundred percent in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. Can our mistakes not be opposed? Even if others are wrong in their opposition, we cannot simply suppress them. We must use facts and reasoning to help them recognize and correct their mistakes with enthusiasm.

Uniting with those who have opposed us to work together is not about compromising or merging two into one. We have not and will not forcibly combine two fundamentally opposed things. Just as we have contradictions and struggles with this student, but these are internal contradictions and struggles among the people, we are fundamentally in agreement with him. How can this be compromising or merging two into one? We also do not negate ideological struggle. Chairman Mao says: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon to achieve unity within the party and revolutionary organizations, making them more effective in battle." We unite with this student to work together, while also criticizing his mistakes. This is precisely seeking unity through struggle, not abandoning struggle.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary youths have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, daring to revolutionize and rebel, defeating the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, making them fall flat on their faces. It is in this great revolution that touches people's souls that revolutionary youths, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have learned to widely connect with the masses and unite with the majority of the masses. At the same time, they have also learned to unite with those who have opposed them.

    善于团结反对过自己的同志
    北京师范大学井冈山公社雷达兵
    毛主席教导我们：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”
    无产阶级革命派要遵循毛主席的教导，善于团结群众的大多数，在革命队伍内部，就是对那些反对过自己的人，也要善于团结他们一道工作。
    在我们学校流传着这样一个故事：有一个同学，曾是井冈山红卫兵负责人，由于他有比较严重的无政府主义，一度退出井冈山。经过批评和自我批评，他对错误有了认识，重新回到井冈山来，并被吸收参加工作。在不久前，井冈山主要负责人还提出吸收他参加革命委员会。
    事情很平常，但要这样做又不是一件容易的事。有的同志就想不通：这个同学犯了错误，还要他回到革命组织中来，原则哪里去了！这不是合二而一吗？
    其实，同这些同志想的完全相反，这样做，正好体现了一个重要的原则。
    同世界上任何事物一样，革命队伍内部，也存在着矛盾和斗争。这是正常现象。只要有矛盾，有斗争，就有拥护自己的人，也会有反对自己的人。
    但是，我们的原则不是以反对或者拥护自己为依据。毛主席教导我们：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”只有无产阶级革命的根本利益，才是我们一切行动的最高准则，如果背离了这一点，即使对那些所谓“拥护”自己的人，也不能同他们讲团结。相反，只要不是违背无产阶级革命根本利益的，对于那些反对过自己的人，我们也应该团结他们一道工作。这个同学虽然在某些方面反对过井冈山，是错误的，但他不是井冈山的敌人。从根本上说，他同井冈山是一致的，他同井冈山有一个共同的敌人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。团结起来打倒共同敌人，这就是无产阶级革命的根本利益，这就是原则。
    原则，从来就是阶级的原则。毛主席的革命路线是我国无产阶级和劳动人民利益的最高体现。拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是革命的最高原则。毛主席的革命路线要求我们任何时候，都要相信群众的大多数。我们要看到，群众的绝大多数是拥护毛主席的革命路线的。有些同志由于一时受资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，站错了队，犯了错误，但经过教育，是能够觉悟过来回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的。仅仅看到别人反对过自己，就不相信他是要革命的，把他当作敌人看待，排斥在革命队伍的大门之外，这就违背了毛主席的革命路线，从根本上背离了无产阶级的革命原则。让这个同学重回井冈山来，团结他一道工作，给他改正错误的机会，允许他革命，这正是相信群众的表现，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线所要求的，是坚持无产阶级革命原则的表现。
    有的同志听不得反对意见，一听到反对意见就翻脸不认人，甚至挽袖子伸拳头，更谈不到团结反对过自己的同志一道工作。这是错误的。对待自己的同志说不服，难道用压的办法就能压服吗？这些同志不懂得，我们自己并不是百分之百的正确，百分之百的符合毛泽东思想。难道我们的错误不可以反对吗？即使别人反对错了，也不能一压了事，也要用摆事实讲道理的方法，满腔热情地帮助他认识和改正错误。
    团结反对过自己的人一道工作，决不是和稀泥，搞合二而一。我们没有也不会把两个根本对立的事物硬拉扯在一起。正象我们同这个同学有矛盾，有斗争，但这是人民内部的矛盾和斗争，我们同他在根本上还是一致的，怎么是和稀泥、搞合二而一呢？我们也不是不要思想斗争。毛主席说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”我们团结这个同学一道工作，同时又批评他的错误，这正是通过斗争求团结，决不是放弃斗争。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命小将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢革命，敢造反，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打了个人仰马翻，一败涂地。正是在这场触及人们灵魂的伟大革命中，革命小将按照毛主席的教导学会了广泛地联系群众，团结群众大多数，同时也学会了团结反对过自己的人。
