An elderly African seaman shouted: Now we have our own ships! To hell with the Americans, the British, and other imperialists!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, June 22: Tanzanian President Nyerere announced the official establishment of the China-Tanzania Joint Shipping Company at Dar es Salaam port this afternoon. At the ceremony for the establishment of this joint company, President Nyerere highly praised the friendship between Tanzania and China.

Tanzania's first ocean-going cargo ship, the Ushirikiano (Cooperation) No. 1, slowly raised the blue, black, and green tricolor flag of Tanzania to the sound of the Tanzanian national anthem.

In the midst of warm applause, President Nyerere handed the registration certificate of the "Ushirikiano No. 1" ship to Chinese captain Hu Zhen.

In his speech at the ceremony, the acting head of the Chinese Embassy in Tanzania, Zhou Boqing, said: "The purpose of establishing this joint shipping company is to promote economic cooperation between China and Tanzania and to develop the maritime industry." He expressed gratitude to President Nyerere and the Tanzanian government for their care and support in establishing the joint company.

In his speech, Tanzanian Minister of Transport, Labor, and Engineering Lusinde thanked the Chinese government and people for their selfless assistance in establishing the joint shipping company. The minister also said that operating this shipping company would greatly help Tanzania implement the policy of self-reliance in developing its national economy. He expressed his belief that friendly cooperation between Tanzania and China would continue to develop.

Tanzanian people from all walks of life were thrilled about the development of maritime cooperation between China and Tanzania. A member of parliament said: "This is a historic event. From now on, we have broken the monopoly of imperialist countries on maritime transportation." An elderly African seaman shouted: "Now we have our own ships! To hell with the Americans, the British, and other imperialists! You can no longer strangle us!" Many African dock workers asked Chinese sailors for Chairman Mao badges. They gave a thumbs up and repeatedly said in Swahili: "Chairman Mao is great!"

    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十二日电　坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔二十二日下午在达累斯萨拉姆港口宣布中国—坦桑尼亚联合航运公司正式成立。在这个联合公司的成立仪式上，尼雷尔总统高度赞扬坦桑尼亚和中国之间的友谊。
    坦桑尼亚第一艘远洋货轮——乌希里卡（合作）号在坦桑尼亚的国歌声中，徐徐升起了蓝、黑、绿三色的坦桑尼亚国旗。
    尼雷尔总统在热烈的掌声中把“乌希里卡号”轮船的登记证书交给了中国船长胡峥。
    中国驻坦桑尼亚大使馆临时代办周伯萍在仪式上讲话时说：“成立这家联合航运公司的目的是促进中国与坦桑尼亚之间的经济合作，发展海运事业。”他表示感谢尼雷尔总统和坦桑尼亚政府对建立联合公司的关怀和支持。
    坦桑尼亚交通劳动和工程部长卢辛德在讲话中感谢中国政府和人民在建立联合航运公司方面所给予的无私援助。这位部长又说，开办这一航运公司将大大地帮助坦桑尼亚在发展民族经济方面贯彻自力更生的政策。他表示相信，坦桑尼亚和中国之间的友好合作将日益发展。
    坦桑尼亚各界人士对中坦合作发展海运事业表现兴高采烈。一位议员说：“这是一件有历史意义的事情，从此以后，我们打破了帝国主义国家对海运的垄断。”一位非洲老海员高呼：“现在我们有自己的轮船了！美国人、英国人和其他帝国主义者见鬼去吧，你们再也不能卡住我们的喉咙了！”许多非洲码头工人向中国海员要毛主席像章。他们翘起大拇指，一再用斯瓦希利语说：“毛主席真好！”
