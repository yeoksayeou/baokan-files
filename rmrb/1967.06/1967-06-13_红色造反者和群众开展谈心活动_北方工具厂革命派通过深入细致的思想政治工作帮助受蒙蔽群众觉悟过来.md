The Red Rebels and the masses in the Northern Tool Factory have engaged in heart-to-heart talks. The revolutionary faction of the Northern Tool Factory, through meticulous ideological and political work, has helped the deceived masses to become enlightened.

After the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team from a certain unit in Heilongjiang arrived at the Northern Tool Factory, they discovered that some members of the revolutionary organization "Red Rebels" had adopted a discriminatory attitude towards those who had been deceived into joining conservative organizations. Some of the masses who had previously participated in conservative organizations were also filled with apprehension. To address this situation, the propaganda team first helped the "Red Rebels" repeatedly study "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and Chairman Mao's teachings on how the proletariat can only ultimately liberate itself by liberating all of humanity. They organized discussions on why it is necessary to win over and unite the deceived masses, helping them to understand through these discussions that uniting the deceived masses is a necessity for the revolution and for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Educating and uniting the deceived masses is a process of using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to overcome the bourgeois reactionary line, and a process of continuously establishing a communist worldview of liberating all of humanity. The proletarian revolutionary faction has the responsibility to use Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian class feelings to help them, so that they can quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

How exactly should the broad masses who have been deceived be won over and united? The propaganda team helped the Red Rebels study Chairman Mao's instructions that politics is the commander, the soul, and that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They made it clear that the most important aspect of winning over and uniting the broad masses who have been deceived is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take class struggle as the key link, and to conduct thorough and meticulous ideological and political work among them. They first focused on class education, launching various forms of reminiscence and comparison activities throughout the factory. They mobilized the masses to recount the history of the working class being exploited and oppressed in the old society, to contrast it with the happy life they now enjoy under Chairman Mao's leadership; to expose the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and all the ghosts and monsters attempting to restore capitalism, and to see the profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; to see the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to understand the position and role of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Old worker Yu Hongxiang, with a deep sense of bitterness and hatred, recalled his miserable family history in the old society, tears streaming down his face as he said, "The number one power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road wants us to go back on our path, to suffer twice, which is absolutely not allowed. In the past, I was deceived by them and helped them, but this time I have seen clearly that following these people is a dead end, while following Chairman Mao is the path to brightness."

Chairman Mao instructs us: to carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team also helped the "Red Rebels" use the method of heart-to-heart talks to conduct mass ideological mutual aid activities with the deceived masses. They patiently, sincerely, actively, and enthusiastically studied the "Three Articles" together with the deceived masses, shared their thoughts, fought against selfishness, and helped the deceived masses to educate and liberate themselves. A core member of a conservative organization, after the dissolution of the conservative organization, still could not turn around. A member of the "Red Rebels" took the initiative to have heart-to-heart talks with her several times, but due to differing viewpoints, the talks ended unhappily each time. This revolutionary comrade was feeling discouraged when the propaganda team's comrades studied Chairman Mao's teachings with him: "Our comrades must understand that ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and detailed task. It is not possible to change someone's ideological consciousness, which has been formed over decades of life, by giving a few lectures or holding a few meetings." They also analyzed the ideological situation of this core member of the conservative organization with this revolutionary comrade. She was a child with deep bitterness and hatred, who lost her parents at a young age and lived a vagrant life. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved her from the pit of fire. She indeed loves the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of her heart. This time, she was deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and joined the wrong side. As long as her consciousness is raised and she sees the correct direction, she will definitely return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Thus, this revolutionary comrade went to help her with full enthusiasm, studying the "Three Articles," the "Sixteen Points," and Chairman Mao's relevant discussions on class and class struggle with her, and helping her recall her family history. In this way, after one, two, three times, up to eleven times, she finally became enlightened.

As a result of correctly handling the masses who participated in conservative organizations, more than 95% of the masses have now united around the "Red Rebels."

    红色造反者和群众开展谈心活动
    北方工具厂革命派通过深入细致的思想政治工作帮助受蒙蔽群众觉悟过来
    人民解放军黑龙江驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队来到北方工具厂以后，发现这个厂的革命组织“红色造反者”中的有的同志，对因受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众，采取歧视的态度；曾参加过保守组织的一些群众也顾虑重重。针对这种情况，宣传队的同志首先帮助“红色造反者”反复学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和毛主席关于无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己等教导，组织他们讨论：为什么要争取、团结受蒙蔽的群众？使他们通过讨论认识到，团结受蒙蔽的群众是革命的需要，是无产阶级文化大革命的需要。教育、团结受蒙蔽的群众的过程，就是用毛主席无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的过程，就是自己不断树立解放全人类的共产主义世界观的过程。无产阶级革命派有责任用毛泽东思想、用无产阶级的阶级感情去帮助他们，使他们尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    究竟怎样去争取团结广大受蒙蔽的群众呢？宣传队的同志们帮助红色造反者又学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的指示，明确争取团结广大受蒙蔽群众的工作，最重要的就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，向他们进行深入细致的思想政治工作。他们首先抓了阶级教育，在全厂开展了形式多样的回忆对比活动，发动群众摆工人阶级在旧社会受剥削、受压迫的血泪史，看今天在毛主席领导下过的幸福生活；摆党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶事实，看无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义；摆无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，看革命工人、革命干部在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的地位和作用。苦大仇深的老工人于洪祥回忆了自己在旧社会的苦难家史，热泪满眶地说：“党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，想让我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，这是万万不能的。过去，我上了他们的当，帮了他们的忙，这回我可看清了，跟着这帮家伙走是死路一条，跟着毛主席走才是阳关大道。”
    毛主席指示我们：开展谈心活动，这个方法很好。毛泽东思想宣传队还帮助“红色造反者”运用谈心的方法，向受蒙蔽的群众开展群众性的思想互助活动，耐心诚恳地、积极热忱地和受蒙蔽的群众一起学习“老三篇”，一起亮思想，斗私心，帮助受蒙蔽群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。有个保守组织的核心成员，在保守组织解散以后，仍转不过弯来。“红色造反者”的一个成员，就多次主动和她谈心，但因观点不一致，谈了几次，都不欢而散。这个革命派战士正在灰心的时候，宣传队的同志和他一起学习了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”并和这个革命派战士一起详细分析了这个保守组织核心成员的思想情况。她是个苦大仇深的孩子，小的时候失去了父母，过着流浪生活。是党和毛主席把她从火坑里救出来的，她的确从心眼里热爱党，热爱毛主席。这次她是上了资产阶级反动路线的当，站错了队，只要提高了觉悟，认清了大方向，一定会回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。于是，这个革命派的战士又满腔热情地去帮助她，同她一起学习“老三篇”、《十六条》和毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，并帮助她回忆自己的家史。这样，一次，两次，三次，一直谈了十一次，终于使她觉悟过来。
    正确地对待参加保守组织的群众的结果，现在百分之九十五以上的群众都团结到了“红色造反者”的周围。
