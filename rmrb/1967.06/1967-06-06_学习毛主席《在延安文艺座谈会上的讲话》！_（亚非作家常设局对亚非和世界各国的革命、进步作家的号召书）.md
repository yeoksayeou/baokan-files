The red flag is flying, and the thunder is roaring. At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers invited friends from 34 countries and regions around the world to hold a grand study and discussion meeting in Beijing, the heart of the world revolution. This fully expresses our boundless respect for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people—the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao—and our shared resolve to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art.

Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a landmark work of Marxism-Leninism, the most complete, thorough, correct, and revolutionary proletarian literary program in human history. It is a powerful ideological weapon for revolutionaries to transform their subjective and objective worlds in the image of the proletariat. It is the battle cry for the oppressed nations and peoples of the world to wage political and ideological struggles against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

During the period of the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression and the War of Liberation, this great work guided a vast number of revolutionary literary and art workers to join the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, turning literature and art into a powerful weapon to support the revolutionary armed struggle for seizing political power. They made great contributions to the annihilation of the ferocious Japanese invaders and the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Today, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this great work has become the battle program for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in China, and the Red Guards to smash all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. This great revolution marks a new stage in the development of Marxism. It is sweeping away all the filth in society, uprooting the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line that has been buried in the Chinese literary and art circles, and shattering the beautiful dream of the capitalist roaders within the Chinese Communist Party to restore capitalism. It has greatly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, consolidated the base of the world revolution, and powerfully supported the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and the world revolution. It has dealt a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries.

The "Talks" profoundly points out: Literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers ("soldiers" refer to the armed forces). The workers and peasants are the most numerous and powerful. They create and defend the material and spiritual wealth of human society with their labor and wisdom. They are the true masters of the world. However, in a society ruled by the exploiting classes, they are oppressed at the bottom of society, living in poverty and hardship, worse than cattle. They have the deepest hatred for the exploiting classes and the strongest fighting spirit. They are the main force of the revolution. Serving the workers and peasants means serving the fundamental interests of the workers and peasants, serving their revolutionary struggle to seize and consolidate political power; in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, it is currently mainly serving the revolutionary struggle and people's revolutionary wars against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Asian, African, and world peoples. It supports reactionary forces everywhere, engages in mad plunder, cruel persecution, and bloody suppression. In Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is slaughtering revolutionary people, expanding the war of aggression, and carrying out a new and serious war "escalation"; in Palestine, in the Middle East, the U.S. and its accomplices are sharpening their knives, using the dagger stuck in the heart of the Arab world—Israel—to provoke armed provocations and war threats against the Arab people; in the Congo (Kinshasa), in Indonesia, and around the world, they have committed heinous crimes.

The Soviet modern revisionists are the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Now they are further betraying the revolutionary cause of the world's peoples, using every means to sabotage the revolutionary struggles and national liberation movements of the world's peoples, and are wholeheartedly serving the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism. They also carry out cultural infiltration against the Asian, African, and world peoples, poisoning and numbing the revolutionary people with extremely reactionary and decadent revisionist literature and art, advocating that exploitation is guiltless and rebellion is unjust, attempting to spiritually conquer the revolutionary people. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance; the more oppressive, the stronger the resistance. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the current world revolutionary situation is excellent. Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the center of the world revolutionary storm. There, the oppressed peoples have taken up arms and are fighting bravely, one after another. The flames of the national liberation movement are burning across the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are like a herd of wild bulls charging into a fire, getting burned and frantically struggling to their deaths.

Chairman Mao said: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. But having only this kind of army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." To achieve the thorough victory of the world revolution and the complete liberation of all humanity, we must build a revolutionary cultural army to cooperate with the revolutionary military front in smashing the enemy's armed suppression and cultural aggression. For this purpose, the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers issues a battle call to the revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia, Africa, and the world:

We must strive to study Chairman Mao's great works, study "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Chairman Mao's most revolutionary poems. Study with reverence for Chairman Mao, with a thirst for truth and a desire for revolutionary victory; study in the storms of class struggle and in the fires of national liberation struggles; study seriously and repeatedly; study and apply, combining learning with practice. We must be like the pioneers of China's Cultural Revolution, taking Mao Zedong Thought as our guide for all actions, engraving it in our minds, dissolving it in our blood, and implementing it in our actions.

As pointed out in the "Talks," we must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, mobilize hundreds of millions of people to denounce and attack imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary literature and art, stripping off their various disguises, and thoroughly exposing the evil purposes of "humanitarianism," "people's literature and art," "art for art's sake," traitor literature, decadent literature, and yellow literature that deceive and poison the people. Let the people recognize that U.S. imperialism's cultural aggression and the Soviet revisionist counter-revolutionary literary line serve their reactionary political purpose of enslaving the world's peoples. Revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia, Africa, and the world, let us, together with the people of the world, wield the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the spirit of the bravest warrior on the revolutionary cultural front, Lu Xun, give a thorough beating to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, the reactionaries of various countries, and their running dogs. We must organize and temper a vast revolutionary literary and art army in the midst of criticism and struggle, and establish a new literature and art that is anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist, and for the people and the nation.

We must study and apply the "Talks" and other works of Chairman Mao, taking Chairman Mao's poems as an example of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. We must hoist high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, taking the new literature and art born in the storm of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as an example, making literature and art serve the current revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, serve the workers, peasants, and people's armed forces, turning literature and art into daggers, spears, drums, and trumpets, enthusiastically singing the praises of their revolutionary struggles, sculpting the great images of revolutionary heroes, mercilessly exposing the enemy's ferocity, brutality, and weakness, exposing the cultural aggression and infiltration of imperialism and modern revisionism; let the voice of "revolution is guiltless, rebellion is just" resound through the clouds; awaken more workers and peasants, take up arms, and join the ranks of the struggle, making more warriors fight with doubled courage against the enemy; make the flames of battle burn brighter, make the news of victory more frequent, and turn history, which has been turned upside down, right side up again.

We must remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually unite with the workers and peasants." We must resolutely go to the factories, go to the countryside, go to the battlefields filled with gunpowder, share weal and woe with the workers and peasants, and fight shoulder to shoulder. In the great struggle between the revolutionary class and the reactionary class, with guns against guns, we must increase our hatred for the enemy and deepen our love for the workers and peasants. Through long-term arduous tempering, we must gradually shift our standpoint to the side of the workers and peasants, to the side of the proletariat. Truly achieve hating what the workers and peasants hate, loving what the workers and peasants love; stand at the forefront of the struggle, shout the strongest voice of the times, and create the great images of workers, peasants, and people's armed forces loved by the Asian and African peoples, opening up a brilliant new era for Asian and African revolutionary literature and art.

Revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia, Africa, and the world, today the world is entering a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest commander of the world's revolutionary people in their revolutionary struggles. "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the guiding light, action guide, and battle cry for the world's revolutionary people, especially all revolutionary and progressive writers. With it, no matter how dark the sky or how thick the fog, we can discern the direction; with it, no matter how fierce the wind or how high the waves, we can stand firm; with it, we will increase our revolutionary wisdom, fighting courage, and the power to turn the world upside down. We must strive to study it, faithfully carry it out, enthusiastically propagate it, and bravely defend it. Following the revolutionary line pointed out by the great commander Chairman Mao, we will march forward, forward, and bravely forward to a more brilliant future.

Our study and discussion meeting to commemorate the 25th anniversary of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has laid the ideological foundation for the "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" to be held in Beijing, the capital of China. The "Third Conference" will be a conference that raises the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, pushing the movement to study Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The "Third Conference" will also be a conference to further use the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize and organize Afro-Asian revolutionary and progressive writers and people to fight against U.S.-led imperialism, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries. It will be a fighting conference, a united conference, and a victorious conference. We are confident that under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, through everyone's joint efforts, the "Third Conference" will definitely be successful.

Dawn is just ahead. Revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia, Africa, and the world, and heroic peoples, fight more bravely. Victory will surely be ours.

    学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》！
    （亚非作家常设局对亚非和世界各国的革命、进步作家的号召书）
    一九六七年六月五日亚非和世界各国的革命、进步作家们：
    红旗翻滚，风雷激荡。在中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大胜利的时刻，为了纪念毛泽东主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年，亚非作家常设局邀请了世界三十四个国家和地区的朋友，在世界革命的心脏北京，举办了一次盛大的学习讨论会，充分表达了我们对世界革命人民的伟大领袖——我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的无限崇敬的心情，表达了我们忠于毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的共同意志。
    毛主席的《讲话》是一部划时代的马克思列宁主义的伟大著作，是人类历史上最完整、最彻底、最正确、最革命的无产阶级文艺纲领，是革命者按照无产阶级的面貌，改造主观世界与客观世界的强大思想武器，是世界上被压迫民族和被压迫人民同帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派进行政治上、思想上大搏斗的进军号。
    在中国人民反抗日本帝国主义侵略战争时期和解放战争时期，《讲话》这部伟大著作，指引着广大的革命文艺工作者投身到工农兵群众中去，使文艺成为配合革命武装夺取政权的有力武器，为消灭穷凶极恶的日本侵略者和暗无天日的蒋家王朝而建立了功勋；今天，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，《讲话》这部伟大著作，又成为中国广大的工农兵群众和红卫兵小将摧毁一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的战斗纲领。这一场大革命，标志着马克思主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，它正涤荡着社会上一切污泥浊水，挖出了埋伏在中国文艺界的一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，粉碎了中国共产党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。它极大地巩固了中国的无产阶级专政，巩固了世界革命的根据地，有力地支援了被压迫民族的解放斗争和世界革命，给以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派以致命的打击。这一系列震撼世界的伟大胜利，雄辩地证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众一往无前，所向披靡。
    《讲话》深刻地指出：文艺为工农兵服务（“兵”指武装队伍），是无产阶级文艺的根本方向。工农大众，人数最多，力量最大。他们用自己的勤劳和智慧创造着和捍卫着人类社会的物质财富和精神财富，他们是世界的真正主人，但是在剥削阶级专政的社会里，他们却被压在社会的最底层，过着饥寒交迫、牛马不如的生活。他们对剥削阶级仇恨最深，斗争性最强。他们是革命的主力军。文艺为工农兵服务就是为工农大众的根本利益服务，为他们夺取政权和巩固政权的革命斗争服务；在亚非拉，目前主要是为反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命斗争和人民革命战争服务。
    美帝国主义是亚非人民和全世界人民的死敌。它到处扶植反动势力，进行疯狂的掠夺，残酷的迫害，血腥的镇压。在越南，美帝国主义正在疯狂地屠杀革命人民，扩大侵略战争，进行新的严重的战争“升级”；在巴勒斯坦，在中东，美帝和它的同伙正在磨刀霍霍，假手它们插在阿拉伯心脏的一把尖刀——以色列，向阿拉伯人民进行武装挑衅和战争威胁；在刚果（金），在印度尼西亚，在世界各地，他们欠下了累累血债。
    苏联现代修正主义者是美帝的头号帮凶，现在它进一步背叛世界人民的革命事业，千方百计地破坏世界人民的革命斗争和民族解放运动，死心塌地地为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。它还对亚非和世界人民疯狂地进行文化渗透，用极端反动、腐朽的修正主义文艺毒害和麻痹革命人民，宣扬剥削无罪，造反无理，企图从精神上征服革命人民，这是我们断断不能容忍的。
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗；压迫越凶，反抗越强。在毛泽东思想的照耀下，目前世界革命形势大好，亚非拉是世界革命风暴的中心地区。在那里，被压迫人民拿起武器，正在进行前赴后继的英勇战斗，民族解放运动的熊熊烈火正燃烧着亚非拉大陆。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，象一群冲入火阵的野牛，被烧得焦头烂额，疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。
    毛主席说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”为了争取世界革命的彻底胜利，和全人类的彻底解放，必须建立一支革命的文化大军，配合革命军事战线去粉碎敌人的武装镇压和文化侵略。为此，我们亚非作家常设局向亚非和世界各国的革命进步作家发出战斗号召：
    我们要努力学习毛主席的伟大著作，学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛主席最富有革命性的诗词。带着对毛主席的敬仰之心去学，带着渴求真理，追求革命胜利的热望去学；在阶级斗争的风浪中学，在民族解放斗争的烈火中学；认真地学，反复地学；活学活用，学用结合。要象中国文化大革命中的闯将们一样，把毛泽东思想作为我们一切行动的指南，铭刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    我们要象《讲话》指出的那样，高举革命的批判的大旗，动员亿万群众口诛笔伐，向帝国主义、修正主义和反动文艺发动勇猛的进攻，剥下它们形形色色的伪装，彻底揭露“人道主义”、“全民文艺”、“为艺术而艺术”、叛徒文学、颓废文艺、黄色文艺等欺骗人民、毒害人民的罪恶目的，使人民群众认识到美帝国主义的文化侵略和苏修反革命修正主义文艺路线是为他们奴役世界人民的反动政治目的服务的。亚非和世界各国的革命进步作家，让我们和全世界人民一道，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬革命文化战线上最勇敢的战士鲁迅痛打落水狗的精神，对准美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派和它们的走狗，坚决地打，狠狠地打。我们要在批判和斗争中组织和锻炼浩浩荡荡的革命文艺大军，建立反帝反修的、人民大众的、民族的革命新文艺。
    我们必须活学活用《讲话》和其他毛主席著作，以毛主席的诗词作为革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的典范。我们要高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗，以在中国无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中诞生的革命新文艺为榜样，使文艺为当前各国人民的革命斗争服务，为工人、农民和人民武装服务，把文艺作为匕首、投枪、战鼓和号角，去热情地歌颂他们的革命斗争、塑造革命英雄的伟大形象，无情地揭露敌人的凶恶、残暴和虚弱，揭露帝国主义和现代修正主义的文化侵略和渗透；让“革命无罪，造反有理”的声音响彻云霄；使更多的工农大众觉悟起来，拿起刀枪，投入战斗的行列，使更多的战士感奋起来，英勇百倍地向敌人冲杀；使战斗的烈火更旺，胜利的捷报更多，把被颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来。
    我们要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”我们一定要下定决心到工厂去，到农村去，到硝烟滚滚的战场上去，与工农群众同甘共苦、并肩战斗，在刀对刀、枪对枪的革命阶级与反动阶级大搏斗中，增强我们对敌人的憎恨，加深我们对工农的感情，经过长期的艰苦的锻炼，逐渐地把立足点移到工农大众这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。真正做到恨工农之所恨，爱工农之所爱；站在斗争的最前线，喊出时代的最强音，塑造出亚非人民所喜爱的、高大的工农大众和人民武装的英雄形象，开辟亚非革命文艺的光辉灿烂的新纪元。
    亚非和世界各国的革命、进步作家们，今天，世界正在进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。毛泽东主席是全世界革命人民进行革命斗争的最最伟大的统帅，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是世界革命人民特别是一切革命、进步作家的指路明灯、行动指南和战斗的号角。有了它，天再黑，雾再大，我们能明辨方向；有了它，风再狂，浪再高，我们能站稳脚跟；有了它，我们就会增添革命的智慧、战斗的勇气和翻江倒海的力量。我们一定要努力地学习它，忠实地执行它，热情地宣传它，勇敢地捍卫它，沿着伟大统帅毛主席指出的革命路线，朝着更加光辉灿烂的未来，前进，前进，奋勇前进。
    我们这次纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年学习讨论会，为将在中国首都北京举行的“亚非作家第三届大会”奠定了思想基础。“三大”将是一个更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把学习毛主席著作运动推向更高阶段的大会，“三大”也将是进一步运用毛泽东思想这一强大无比的武器，动员、组织亚非革命、进步作家和人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派的战斗的大会、团结的大会、胜利的大会。我们坚信在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，经过大家共同努力，“三大”一定会获得成功。
    曙光就在前头。亚非和世界各国的革命、进步作家和英雄的人民更英勇地战斗吧。胜利一定属于我们。
