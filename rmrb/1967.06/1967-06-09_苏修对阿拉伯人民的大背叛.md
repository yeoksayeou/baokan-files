In the grand conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to invade Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leadership has played a shameful role as an accomplice to the aggression. As the situation in the Middle East develops, the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist traitors is becoming increasingly clear to the people of the world.

When U.S. imperialism instigated Israel to threaten war against Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique neither condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression plot nor supported the Arab countries in taking decisive self-defense countermeasures. Instead, they urged the Arab countries to "restrain" themselves and wait for their "mediation," lulling the Arab countries into complacency. By doing so, you intended to tie the hands of the Arab countries, leaving them unprepared for Israel's sudden attack.

After U.S. imperialism directed Israel to launch a large-scale invasion of Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique neither condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression nor supported the Arab people's anti-aggression war. Instead, they colluded with the Arab people's vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, and completely in accordance with the wishes of the United States, manufactured a "ceasefire immediately" resolution in the Security Council. Immediately afterward, the Soviet revisionist clique pushed even harder, presenting a "ceasefire within a specified time" proposal, increasing the pressure on the Arab countries. By doing so, you intended to force the Arab people to tolerate the armed invasion of U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel, placing the Arab people in an extremely difficult position.

This is the most shameless betrayal and sellout by the Soviet revisionist clique to the Arab people.

The Soviet revisionist clique claims to be friends of the Arab people. However, when the Arab people face difficulties, you collude with the Arab people's mortal enemies, harming the Arab people in secret, and at the crucial moment when the Arab people are fighting to the death against the U.S.-Israeli invaders, you stab them in the back. The Soviet revisionist clique here plays a role that U.S. imperialism itself cannot play, doing a great favor for U.S. imperialism.

To extinguish the anti-imperialist fury of the Arab people, the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism have cooperated so closely. Washington is deeply satisfied with the Soviet revisionists' efforts. The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mansfield, openly boasted that this time "the Soviet Union and the United States were able to coordinate their efforts," which is "encouraging," and expressed the hope that this situation "will continue." These words clearly expose the accomplice nature of the Soviet revisionists.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In addition to remembering our friends, we must firmly remember our enemies and the friends of our enemies." Through this war, the Arab people have seen through the true nature of U.S. imperialism, this mortal enemy, and they will never forget the evil deeds of the Soviet revisionist clique, this "friend of the enemy."

    苏修对阿拉伯人民的大背叛
    在美帝国主义及其走狗侵略阿拉伯国家的大阴谋中，苏修领导集团完全是扮演了一个侵略帮凶的可耻角色。随着中东局势的发展，苏修叛徒的丑恶嘴脸越来越清楚地暴露在全世界人民的面前。
    当美帝国主义策动以色列对阿拉伯国家进行战争威胁时，苏修集团一不谴责美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，二不支持阿拉伯国家采取坚决的自卫反击行动，而是极力要阿拉伯国家“克制”，等待它的“调解”，麻痹阿拉伯国家的警惕性。你们这样做，无非是要捆住阿拉伯国家的手脚，使它们在以色列的突然袭击面前措手不及。
    当美帝国主义指使以色列对阿拉伯国家发动了大规模侵略战争以后，苏修集团又是一不谴责美帝国主义的侵略，二不支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争，而是同阿拉伯人民的凶恶敌人美帝国主义勾结一起，完全按照美国的意旨，在安理会制造了一个“立即停火”的决议。紧接着，苏修集团自己又再加一把劲儿，端出了一个“限期停火”的提案，加重对阿拉伯国家施加的压力。你们这样做，无非是要迫使阿拉伯人民容忍美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的武装侵略，把阿拉伯人民置于极为困难的地位。
    这是苏修集团对阿拉伯人民最无耻的大背叛、大出卖。
    苏修集团口口声声说是阿拉伯人民的朋友。但是当阿拉伯人民遇到患难的时候，你们却同阿拉伯人民的死敌串通一气，对阿拉伯人民进行暗害，在阿拉伯人民同美以侵略者进行殊死斗争的紧要关头，从背后给他们来一刀。苏修集团在这里起了美帝国主义自己所不能起的作用，给美帝国主义帮了大忙。
    为了扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝怒火，苏修和美帝合作得真是紧密极了。华盛顿对于苏修如此卖力，也深表满意。美国参议院外交委员会主席曼斯菲尔德就公开宣扬，这一次“苏联和美国能够协调地”合作，是“令人鼓舞的”，而且表示希望这种情况“将继续下去”。这几句话不就把苏修的帮凶面目活活地勾画出来了吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“除了记住自己的朋友以外，还应当牢牢地记住自己的敌人和敌人的朋友。”通过这一场战争，阿拉伯人民已经看清了美帝国主义这个不共戴天的敌人的本质，他们也决不会忘记苏修集团这个“敌人的朋友”所干的罪恶勾当。
