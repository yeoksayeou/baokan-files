	China's Chargé d'Affaires Strongly Protests Myanmar Authorities' Fascist Atrocities Against Overseas Chinese
	China to Take Corresponding Measures Based on Situation Development

	New China News Agency, June 29th: Yangon News: On the 28th, China's Chargé d'Affaires to Myanmar, Xiao Ming, went to the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strongly protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Myanmar government, which incited mobs to kill overseas Chinese, illegally arrest overseas Chinese, and loot their property on the 27th.

	The Executive Secretary of the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Ohn Kyin, did not dare to show his face, and the First Political Affairs Director, U Laung, received the visit.

	Xiao Ming sternly pointed out that on the afternoon of the 27th, about 300 Myanmar mobs crazily attacked the Overseas Chinese Teachers' Association, killing 27 people. A female overseas Chinese was brutally and inhumanely murdered. The office of the Overseas Chinese Teachers' Association was burned down. This shocking fascist atrocity occurred after the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar repeatedly requested the Myanmar government to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese. For this, Xiao Ming, on behalf of the Chinese government, strongly protested to the Myanmar government.

	Xiao Ming demanded that the Myanmar government must immediately take the following measures: first, severely punish the culprits; second, compensate the families of the victims; third, compensate for all losses; fourth, the Myanmar government has no right to handle the bodies of the murdered overseas Chinese before the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires sees them. If the Myanmar government handles them arbitrarily, it must bear all serious consequences that may arise; fifth, the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs should immediately send high-level officials to inspect the bodies of the murdered overseas Chinese and the burned office with the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires.

	Xiao Ming pointed out that in the past two days, more than 50 overseas Chinese have been killed by mobs organized by the Myanmar government, many overseas Chinese shops have been burned, and dozens of cars have been destroyed. For this, the Chinese government reserves the right to demand compensation for all losses of life and property.

	Xiao Ming demanded that the Myanmar government immediately release the more than 600 innocent overseas Chinese students and their parents who were illegally arrested. Before that, the Myanmar government should accompany the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to visit them.

	Xiao Ming formally notified the Myanmar government: The People's Republic of China government, 700 million Chinese people, and overseas Chinese patriots are closely watching the development of the anti-China situation in Myanmar. The Chinese government will take corresponding measures based on the situation.

	Xiao Ming finally pointed out that the Myanmar government must immediately give a satisfactory response to the above demands.

	However, U Laung tried to evade responsibility, delay time, and did not give a direct response. After Xiao Ming expressed his determination that U Laung would not leave the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs without a direct response, U Laung agreed to respond by 12 o'clock.

	Xiao Ming went to the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs again at 12 o'clock. U Laung attempted to shirk responsibility, saying: regarding the punishment of the culprits, compensation for the families of the victims, and compensation for losses, it is under investigation and will be handled according to the law; the students are now in a safe place and it is not convenient to visit them to avoid exposure, which may endanger their lives; regarding the dead and injured overseas Chinese, it is under investigation, etc.

	Xiao Ming immediately refuted this, pointing out that this is the Myanmar government's attempt to shirk responsibility after plotting to kill overseas Chinese. The Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot tolerate this.

    我临时代办最最强烈抗议缅甸当局残杀华侨的法西斯暴行
    中国政府将视局势发展采取相应措施
    新华社二十九日讯仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明二十八日前往缅甸外交部，就二十七日缅甸政府怂恿暴徒打死华侨，非法逮捕华侨和抢劫华侨财产的法西斯暴行，向缅甸政府提出最最强烈，最最紧急的抗议。
    缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦畏罪不敢露面，由第一政治司司长吴拉昂接见。
    肖明严正指出，二十七日下午四时，缅甸暴徒三百多人疯狂袭击华侨教师联合会，打死二十七人，一华侨女同胞遭到惨无人道的、灭绝人性的杀害。华侨教师联合会办公处被烧。这一骇人听闻的法西斯暴行是在中国驻缅甸大使馆多次要求缅甸政府保护华侨生命财产的安全以后发生的。对此，肖明代表中国政府向缅甸政府提出最最强烈、最最紧急的抗议。
    肖明要求缅甸政府必须立即采取如下措施：一，严惩凶手；二，抚恤受难者家属；三，赔偿一切损失；四，在中国临时代办看到被害华侨尸体以前，缅甸政府无权处理，如缅甸政府擅自处理，必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果；五，缅甸外交部派高级官员立即与中国临时代办一道察验被害华侨尸体及被烧办公处。
    肖明指出，两天来，已有五十多名华侨被缅甸政府组织的暴徒杀害，华侨店铺多家被烧，几十部汽车被毁，对此，中国政府保留提出赔偿一切生命财产损失的权利。
    肖明要求缅甸政府立即释放被非法逮捕的六百多名无辜华侨学生及家长，在这以前，要求缅甸政府陪同中国临时代办看望他们。
    肖明正式通知缅甸政府：中华人民共和国政府，七亿中国人民和广大海外爱国华侨正密切注视缅甸反华局势的发展，中国政府将视情况采取相应措施。
    肖明最后指出，缅甸政府必须对上述要求立即做出满意的答复。
    但是，吴拉昂竭力诡辩，拖延时间，不予正面答复。在肖明表示吴拉昂不正面答复决不离开缅甸外交部的决心后，吴拉昂约定十二时答复。
    肖明十二时再度去缅甸外交部。吴拉昂妄图推卸责任，胡说：关于惩办凶手，抚恤受难者家属，赔偿损失问题，正在调查，按法律办理；学生现在放在安全的地方，不便去探望，以免暴露，危及他们的生命安全；关于死伤华侨，正在调查，等等。
    肖明当即据理驳斥，指出，这是缅甸政府在预谋残杀华侨之后妄图推脱罪责。中国政府和中国人民决不能容忍。
