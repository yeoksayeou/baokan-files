The six political criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" serve as a microscope to distinguish between enemies and friends, discerning the finest details. With this microscope, it is clear who are the monsters and who are comrades and friends. By mastering the use of this microscope, our vision will be clear, our direction will be accurate, and we will be able to unite with true friends and strike down real enemies.

Revisiting Lenin's Teachings

Lenin said: "Only those who acknowledge class struggle and also acknowledge the dictatorship of the proletariat are Marxists." Revisiting this teaching by Lenin is also meaningful for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, some comrades confuse proletarian democracy with bourgeois liberalization, and anarchist thoughts are quite severe. These comrades should be reminded that anarchist thoughts are thoughts that do not recognize the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is actually a denial of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it goes against Lenin's teachings.

Never "Requesting Leave"

Comrade Lü Xiangbi has a steadfast rule: reading Chairman Mao's books every day, never "requesting leave" from studying Chairman Mao's works. This is something that revolutionary comrades of the proletariat should learn from. Some comrades, after achieving victory in struggle, are busy with administrative tasks every day and often "request leave" from studying Chairman Mao's works. As a result, the more "leave" they request, the more problems they encounter in their work and thoughts. Only by reading Chairman Mao's books every day, like Lü Xiangbi, never "requesting leave," can one maintain a clear mind and advance victoriously in the great storms of revolution.

Thoroughly, Resolutely, and Constantly Break

Revolutionary youngsters should not be content with minor or moderate "breakings of private interests and establishment of public interests." They should thoroughly and resolutely break, not occasionally but constantly and daily. Only by thoroughly, resolutely, constantly, and daily breaking bourgeois thoughts such as individualism, factionalism, and cliquism can these thoughts have no place in one's mind. Only by thoroughly, resolutely, constantly, and daily breaking bourgeois thoughts can one firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can grasp the correct direction of struggle.

    区分敌我的显微镜
    毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中提出的六条政治标准，是区分敌我，明察秋毫的显微镜。用这个显微镜一照，谁是牛鬼蛇神，谁是同志朋友，一清二楚。学会运用这架显微镜，我们的眼睛就明，方向就准，就能团结真正的朋友，打击真正的敌人。　 			高允明
    重温列宁的教导
    列宁说：“只有承认阶级斗争，同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”重温列宁的这一教导对无产阶级文化大革命也有实际意义。
    目前在一些同志的头脑里，混淆了无产阶级大民主和资产阶级自由化的界限，无政府主义思想相当严重。应当提醒这些同志，无政府主义思想，就是眼里没有无产阶级专政的思想，实际上也就是不承认无产阶级专政的思想，是违背了列宁的遗训啊！　陈华
    从不“请假”
    吕祥璧同志有条雷打不散的制度：天天读毛主席的书，从来“不向学习毛主席著作请假”。这点非常值得无产阶级革命派战士学习。有些同志在取得斗争胜利以后，就整天忙于事务，在学习毛主席著作方面经常“请假”，结果“假”愈“请”得多，工作上和思想上的问题也就愈多。只有象吕祥璧那样天天读毛主席的书，从不“请假”，他才能永远保持清醒的头脑，在革命的大风浪中胜利前进。　红星
    大破、狠破、经常破
    革命小将“破私立公”，进行思想革命，不应当满足于小破、中破，而应当大破、狠破。不应当时而破，时而不破，而应当经常破、天天破。这样，那些个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义等等资产阶级思想，才可能在自己的脑子里无存身之地。只有这样大破、狠破、经常破、天天破资产阶级思想，才能大立毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，才能掌握斗争的大方向。　徐明
