The brigade of Xiaosan in Hongqiao People's Commune, Shanghai County, has earnestly implemented the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and driven by the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the brigade has achieved remarkable results in summer harvesting, planting, and management. The work has seen high attendance, enthusiasm, speed, and quality.

Before the busy summer season, the brigade held a meaningful discussion on how to win the battle of the three summers. A minority believed that during the busy season, production comes first, and the study of Chairman Mao's works and criticism can be relaxed. The majority disagreed with this view. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on political work being the lifeline of all economic work and his great teachings on criticizing the bourgeoisie among the peasantry of the commune. They unanimously recognized that whether or not to insist on political leadership, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry out revolutionary criticism is a major issue concerning whether to follow the socialist or capitalist road, and whether the country will change color. Comrade Zhou Jinying, the party branch secretary who was once a child bride, said: "The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road advocates production first, material incentives, and work points as the key, leading us peasants down the dead-end of capitalism. We must not be deceived. We cannot go back to the days of 'no firewood at the stove and no rice in the bowl' or 'wheat in the field, people starving to death in bed.' In the three summers, we must definitely follow Mao Zedong Thought, grasp living thoughts, and mobilize people's enthusiasm." Comrade Gu Binggen, the political instructor of the third production team, was once known as the "production commander" in name but in reality. After studying, he deeply felt: "During the autumn harvest and planting last year, the members actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, braved the heat, and created a new record of high-quality and fast late rice planting in one week. Thinking it over, it is still the human factor that is first. Production relies on people, and on their consciousness."

On the basis of reaching a consensus, various study organizations were promptly established. Thus, the entire brigade presented a moving scene of studying, lecturing, and applying Chairman Mao's works extensively.

Ideological revolutionization opens the way for production. Under the guidance of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, the community members' sense of ownership has been greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for labor has reached an unprecedented height. The scene of community members fighting in the three summers is: before the work bell rings, the labor enthusiasm is strong; after the work bell rings, the enthusiasm does not slacken, and they still want to launch an attack. The first production team of fourteen community members sang the quotations song in the field, chasing each other, and carried forward the spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous fighting. They planted five mu of early rice seedlings in one day, improving work efficiency by half. The community members said, Mao Zedong Thought has armed our minds, and we do not know what hardship and fatigue are.

The community members followed Chairman Mao's teachings of practicing thrift and opposing waste, insisting on quality first, and cherishing the fruits of labor. They universally ensured that the cutting was even, the bundling was tight, the carrying was stable, the threshing was clean, and the picking was thorough. The entire brigade picked up more than 1,200 jin of wheat. The wheat fields that have been harvested have increased production by about six jin per mu on average. The community members said, grain is the most precious treasure, and high yield and high production are very important. Chairman Mao's thought comes to arm us, and every grain returns to the barn with high yield.

At present, the brigade's 240 mu of wheat and barley have been completely harvested, most of the rapeseed has been harvested, and most of the early rice planting tasks have been completed. The cotton has been loosened once, and the late rice seedling fields have been fully sown. The progress is one week ahead of last year's three summers, and the quality has surpassed any previous year.

    思想革命化生产开红花
    虹桥公社小三大队以大批判为动力，三夏工作出现了出勤多、干劲高、进度快、质量好的崭新景象。
    本报讯　上海川沙县虹桥公社小三大队认真贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以毛泽东思想为指南，以对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判为动力，在夏收夏种夏管的活动中，促进了人的思想革命化，三夏工作出现了出勤多、干劲高、进度快、质量好的崭新景象。
    三夏大忙到来之前，这个大队进行了一场很有意义的讨论，中心是怎样打好三夏这一仗。少数人认为，大忙季节，生产第一，毛主席著作的学习可以松一松，大批判可以搁一搁。大多数人不同意这种看法。大家学习了毛主席关于政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线的光辉思想，学习了毛主席关于公社农民也要批判资产阶级的伟大教导，一致认识到：能不能坚持政治挂帅，活学活用毛主席著作，开展革命的大批判，是关系到走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题，是关系到我们国家变不变颜色的大问题。童养媳出身的支部书记周金英说：“党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，搞什么生产第一，物质刺激，工分挂帅，是把我们农民往资本主义的死胡同里引。我们千万不能上当。‘脚踏灶前无柴烧，手拿饭箩没米淘’的苦日子，不能再过。‘麦在场上，人饿死在床上’的回头路，不能再走。在三夏中，一定要用毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓活思想，调动人的积极因素。”第三生产队政治指导员顾炳根，群众说他过去名义上叫政治指导员，实际是
  “生产指挥员”。他学习后，深有体会地说：“去年秋收秋种时，社员活学活用毛主席著作好，冒着炎热，突击一周，创造了保质保量快速插晚稻新纪录。想来想去，还是人的因素第一。生产靠人，靠人觉悟高。”
    在统一认识的基础上，及时建立了各种学习组织，于是，整个大队出现了大学大讲大用毛主席著作的动人景象。
    思想革命化，生产开红花。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，社员们的主人翁精神大大发扬，劳动热情空前高涨。社员奋战三夏的情景是：上工未敲钟
  （上工钟），劳动劲头猛；敲钟（收工钟）劲没松，还要打冲锋。第一生产队十四个社员，在田里高唱语录歌，你追我赶，发扬不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，一天插好五亩早稻秧苗，提高工效半倍。社员们说，毛泽东思想武装了头脑，就不知道什么叫苦叫累。
    广大社员遵循毛主席厉行节约，反对浪费的教导，坚持好字当头，质量第一，人人珍惜劳动果实，队队坚持颗粒归仓。普遍做到割得齐，束得紧，挑得稳，打得净，拾得清。全大队共拾麦一千二百多斤，已收割的麦田，平均每亩增收六斤左右。社员们说，粮食是宝中宝，丰产丰收很重要。主席思想来武装，颗粒归仓产量高。
    目前，这个大队二百四十亩元麦、大麦已全部收割完毕，油菜大部收割，早稻插秧任务已经大部完成。棉花全部松土一次，晚稻秧田已全部落谷，进度比去年三夏提前一周，质量超过以往任何一年。
