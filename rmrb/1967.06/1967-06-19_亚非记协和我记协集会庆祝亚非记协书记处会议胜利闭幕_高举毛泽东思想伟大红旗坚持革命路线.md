The Asian-African Journalists' Association and the All-China Journalists' Association held a grand meeting in Beijing today to celebrate the successful conclusion of the fifth full meeting of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat.

More than a thousand friends from various countries and representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions of the capital's news units participated in the celebration. They warmly congratulated the Asian-African Journalists' Association for hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the progressive movement of journalists in Asia and Africa to a new stage.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liu Ningyi, and relevant officials Zhang Ziyu, Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, and Tang Pingzhu attended the celebration. Representatives of liberation organizations from some countries also attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Qia Huaduo. In his speech, he said that the fifth full meeting of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat was successfully concluded on the day China successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb. He warmly congratulated the Chinese people on this brilliant achievement. Qia Huaduo said that the meeting decided to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all our activities, and to make Mao Zedong Thought the guiding ideology for the struggle of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries.

The stage was adorned with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, flanked by eight red flags. The hall was decorated with banners in Chinese, English, Arabic, and French reading: "Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains! You have a world to win!" "Oppose imperialism, and you must oppose modern revisionism!" "Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The representative from Sri Lanka, Manuvila, read the "Resolution on the Current International Political Situation" adopted by the meeting.

Japanese representative Kobayashi Yuichi, representative from Azania, Gora Ibrahim, Sudanese friend Osman, and representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions of the capital's news units spoke at the meeting.

Kobayashi Yuichi, in his speech, talked about the development of the revolutionary journalists' movement in Asia and Africa. He pointed out that the success of the fifth full meeting of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat is a new development in the revolutionary journalists' movement in Asia and Africa. This meeting clearly proposed to oppose American imperialism, oppose Soviet modern revisionism, support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and decided to take Mao Zedong Thought as the ideological weapon to advance our movement.

Gora Ibrahim said that the Asian-African Journalists' Association has become a revolutionary international organization guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which is a new victory in the Asian-African revolution.

Sudanese friend Osman said in his speech that the fifth full meeting of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat has determined a new revolutionary line of action based on Mao Zedong Thought, which is a great leap forward in the history of the journalists' movement in Asia and Africa. He said that the world is entering a new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible weapon in the hands of the oppressed people. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the paper tiger of American imperialism will surely be burned to ashes in the flames of people's war. The number one accomplice of American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, is also just a paper tiger. The day when the revolutionary people throw them into the garbage bin is not far away.

The representative of the proletarian revolutionary factions of the capital's news units said in his speech that the fifth full meeting of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat is a meeting that hoists the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and a meeting that hoists the revolutionary banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. He said that Chinese revolutionary journalists must, together with revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa, strive to learn, master, and defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, and together with revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa, spread the sharpest ideological weapon of our times—the Mao Zedong Thought—to the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa and the world.

The meeting ended with the entire audience singing "The Internationale."

After the celebration, the revolutionary songs and dances performed by the cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing were presented.
