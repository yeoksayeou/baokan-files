    The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has achieved a new victory. The leader of the Danish Communist Working Group, Gottfried Appel, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 17 to express his warmest congratulations on the successful test of China's first hydrogen bomb. He said: "This is new evidence of the liberation of the creative power of the Chinese people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is a new victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

    In his telegram, Appel mentioned that imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are doing their utmost to oppose China's development of nuclear weapons. He emphasized: "The great leader of the world's proletariat and revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.'"

    He said: "Those who genuinely hope for the freedom and independence of the people and struggle for it, and those who genuinely want peace and socialism and struggle for it, all regard China's nuclear weapons as a significant contribution to their struggle. It strengthens the united front against U.S.-led imperialism and is a new contribution by the Chinese people to the defense of world peace and the prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons."

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利
    丹麦共产主义工作小组负责人热烈祝贺我氢弹试验成功
    新华社十八日讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产主义工作小组负责人戈特弗雷德·阿佩尔十七日打电报给中国共产党中央委员会，最热烈地祝贺中国第一颗氢弹试验成功。他说：“这是无产阶级文化大革命解放中国人民创造力的新的证据，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利”。
    阿佩尔在电报中提到帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派都竭力反对中国发展核武器时着重指出：全世界无产阶级和革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    他说：“凡是真心希望人民获得自由和独立并为此而斗争的人，真心要和平和社会主义并为此而斗争的人，都把中国的核武器看作是对他们的斗争的卓有成效的贡献。它加强了反对以美国为首的帝国主义的联合阵线，是中国人民对保卫世界和平、对禁止和销毁核武器作出的新的贡献。”
