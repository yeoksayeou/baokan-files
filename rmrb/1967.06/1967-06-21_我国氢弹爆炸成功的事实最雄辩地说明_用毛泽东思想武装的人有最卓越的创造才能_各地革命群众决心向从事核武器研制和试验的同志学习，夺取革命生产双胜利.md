The successful explosion of our country's hydrogen bomb most eloquently proves that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the most excellent creative abilities. Revolutionary masses across the country are determined to learn from comrades engaged in nuclear weapon research and testing, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 20th, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from all over the country continue to enthusiastically celebrate the successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb, and enthusiastically acclaim it as a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

	Members of the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of the Capital, Xu Kai, expressed that they would definitely learn from comrades who participated in the research and testing of the hydrogen bomb, and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially deeply study Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at present, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution. Representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Beijing, Deng Wantian and Luo Ruihua, said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants extend our warmest congratulations to all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientific workers, and all relevant personnel engaged in nuclear weapon research and testing. We will definitely seriously learn from their spirit of diligently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, daring to scale the peaks of science and technology, and grasp revolution and promote production to achieve double victories in revolution and production."

	Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary scientific and technical workers in Shanghai's scientific and technological circles enthusiastically said in a discussion, "Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. With this spiritual atomic bomb, we can create material atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs, and create any miracle in the world." They expressed their determination to learn from all comrades engaged in nuclear weapon research and testing, to lead scientific and technological work with Mao Zedong Thought, and to make new contributions to the development of China's science and technology and socialist construction.

	Chen Yonggui, a member of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and secretary of the Dazhai Party Branch, and Jie Yue, a member of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and a fine-spinning worker from the Taiyuan No. 126 Textile Mill, both wrote articles full of revolutionary spirit, enthusiastically acclaiming the successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb.

	Chen Yonggui said, "The rapid development of our country's nuclear weapons declares the complete bankruptcy of the revisionist line pushed by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party on the scientific front. It once again proves with facts that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, possessing the greatest wisdom, courage, and the most excellent creative abilities. We Dazhai people will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp revolution and promote production, achieve double victories in revolution and production, and strive to make greater contributions to the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution." Jie Yue said, "We must always remember Comrade Lin Biao's teachings, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, achieve the revolutionization of thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, grasp revolution and promote production, and make revolution and production better and better."

	Gu Altao, a famous activist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works from Hongjin Village, Shaxi Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, excitedly said, "Our country has created atomic bombs, missiles, and now hydrogen bombs in a short period of time. What is this reliance on? It relies on the great Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb in the world. The sky is big, the earth is big, but the power of Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest. Those who master Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and most resourceful. No matter what strange things there are, they can all be created. We poor and lower-middle peasants must truly master Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production struggles, and achieve double victories in revolution and production."

	Famous national advanced producers, Fu Shengchang, a worker engineer from Jinan Heavy Machinery Factory, and Sun Maosong, a famous industrial labor model from Heilongjiang Province, a lathe operator from Harbin Oxygen Machine Factory, and others, when celebrating the news of the successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb, all excitedly expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution and promote production," strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, be both revolutionary vanguards and production models, and with the spirit of "seizing the day," strive in every possible way to complete the state plan, and achieve double victories in revolution and production with the revolutionary masses.
