In a previous period, within the revolutionary organizations of the Huabei Metal Structure Factory, some comrades believed that in dealing with the masses who had been misled by conservative organizations, only struggle and applying pressure to the opposing side would work. They would not allow them to speak or give them any room to maneuver, ultimately forcing them to completely submit to the revolutionary faction, thus achieving great unity. The result of this approach was that, on the surface, conservative organizations seemed to dare not act openly; in reality, the issue of ideology was not resolved, and their activities did not stop. Because they were dissatisfied with this method of coercion, some even withdrew from the revolutionary organization.

What was the problem? We, together with the revolutionary faction, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao teaches us: "In dealing with ideological issues among the people, with issues of the spiritual world, using simple methods to handle them not only will not be effective but is also very harmful." He also said: "To make someone submit, one can only persuade, not coerce. The result of coercion is always coercion without submission. Using force to subdue people is not acceptable. This method can be used against enemies, but not against comrades or friends."

Chairman Mao's teachings are so profound! Everyone felt that it was as if he were speaking directly to the situation in our factory. The matter is clear: in dealing with the masses who participate in conservative organizations, using coercive methods will only result in coercion without submission. This approach not only fails to win over and unite the misled masses to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line but also causes the revolutionary faction to alienate the masses and isolate themselves. The contradictions between the revolutionary faction and the misled masses, ultimately, are contradictions among the people. They can only be resolved using the method of "unity-criticism-unity."

The proletarian revolutionary faction listens to Chairman Mao's words the most. Recognizing their mistakes, they immediately corrected them. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they, with full enthusiasm, actively helped the misled class brothers return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They took some specific measures to ease the antagonistic sentiments between themselves and the misled masses. For example, they proactively provided them with paper and pens for writing big-character posters and yielded the auditorium for meetings. They adhered to the principle of "not yielding on major issues, not arguing over minor ones" and actively carried out group discussions, proactively visiting homes and sincerely exchanging hearts. During these discussions, they first examined their own shortcomings and mistakes in attitude and methods, while also clearly pointing out that the misled masses had chosen the wrong side and taken the wrong path. Some revolutionary workers, when discussing with their misled class brothers, recalled the bitterness of the old society and cried together, saying: "We are all bitter gourds on the same vine. It was the reactionary bourgeois line that separated us. We must unite under Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to make the revolution." The sincere and patient help from the revolutionary faction deeply moved the misled masses. Some said: "You strictly demand of yourselves and patiently help us, truly like a revolutionary!"

In dealing with contradictions among the people, the revolutionary faction did not use coercion but persuasion. As a result, in a short time, the misled masses quickly awakened, the conservative organizations completely disintegrated, and the revolutionary organization rapidly grew stronger. Revolutionary comrades deeply felt: "In the past, we ordered the conservative organizations to disband and tried every means to crush them, but we did not crush them; now, we no longer pressure them, and they voluntarily disbanded. This is entirely the power of Mao Zedong Thought."

    只能说服　不能压服
    杨培德
    前一个时期，在华北金属结构厂的革命组织里，有的同志认为：对待保守组织里受蒙蔽的群众，只有斗争，向对方施加压力，不让他们说话，不给他们活动的余地，最后把他们压得完全屈服于革命派，才能实现大联合。这样做的结果，从表面上看，保守组织似乎不敢公开活动了；实际上，思想没有解决问题，活动也没有停止。由于对这种压服的办法看不惯，甚至还有一些人退出了革命组织。
    这是怎么回事呢？我们同革命派一起，学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作。毛主席教导我们：“对待人民内部的思想问题，对待精神世界的问题，用简单的方法去处理，不但不会收效，而且非常有害。”又说：“要人家服，只能说服，不能压服。压服的结果总是压而不服。以力服人是不行的。对付敌人可以这样，对付同志，对付朋友，绝不能用这个方法。”
    毛主席的教导是多么深刻呵！大家感到，就象针对着我们厂的情况说的一样。事情明摆着，对待参加保守组织的群众，采取压服的手段，结果只能是压而不服。这样做，不但不能争取和团结受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线一边，反而会使革命派脱离了群众，孤立了自己。革命派和受蒙蔽的群众之间的矛盾，归根到底，是人民内部矛盾。只能用“团结——批评——团结”的方法去解决。
    无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，认识到自己做错了，马上就改正。他们在毛泽东思想指导下，带着满腔的热情，积极帮助受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄回到毛主席的革命路线上来。他们采取了一些具体措施，缓和同受蒙蔽群众之间的对立情绪。如：主动送给他们写大字报的纸、笔；让出开会用的礼堂。他们掌握“原则问题不让，枝节问题不争”的原则，积极开展群众性的谈心活动，主动上门，诚恳地交心。在谈心时，首先检查自己在态度、方法上的缺点错误，同时也明确指出受蒙蔽的群众站错了队，走错了路。有的革命派工人在和受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄谈心的时候，回忆起旧社会的苦，两个人抱头大哭说：“我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，是资产阶级反动路线使我们分了家。我们一定要在毛主席的革命路线下面，团结起来干革命。”革命派同志诚恳、耐心的帮助，使受蒙蔽的群众很受感动。有的说：“你们这样严格地要求自己，耐心地帮助我们，象个革命派的样子！”
    革命派在处理人民内部矛盾的问题上，不用压服而用说服的办法。结果，在很短的时间里，受蒙蔽的群众迅速觉醒，保守组织彻底分化瓦解，革命组织迅速发展壮大。革命派的同志深有感触地说：“过去我们勒令保守组织解散，千方百计想压垮他们，并没有把他们压垮；现在，我们不再压他们了，他们却自动解散了。这完全是毛泽东思想的威力。”
