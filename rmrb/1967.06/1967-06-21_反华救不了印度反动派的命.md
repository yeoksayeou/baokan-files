The Indian reactionary government has organized and planned to incite a large number of thugs to insult the great leader of the Chinese people, attack the Chinese Embassy, tear up the national flag of the People's Republic of China, and brutally beat the staff of the Chinese Embassy. This unprecedented outrage in the history of international relations has infuriated the 700 million Chinese people.

The Indian reactionary government is shameless to the extreme, using the expulsion of the Indian spy Lu Guannan by China as an excuse to launch a frenzied anti-China campaign. Lu Guannan wore the disguise of an Indian diplomat but engaged in the dirty business of international espionage. Such a scoundrel, caught red-handed, deserves to be punished by law. The Chinese government will certainly deal with him according to the law. No matter who it is, no matter how many people the Indian reactionary government sends to China, as long as they engage in espionage activities, the Chinese government will handle them in the same way. No one can stop the Chinese government from exercising its right to maintain national sovereignty and security.

The Indian reactionary government, in a fit of shame and anger, not only falsely accused Chinese diplomats but also brazenly trampled on the basic norms of international relations by organizing thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy, committing heinous crimes. Such despicable acts are beyond what any government with a modicum of decency would do.

It is clear that the Indian reactionary government is deliberately stirring up a new wave of anti-China sentiment to meet its domestic and foreign policy needs.

Since this Indian reactionary government came to power more than three months ago, it has, in order to deal with the serious economic crisis and the Indian people's struggle against oppression and for survival, increasingly relied on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism abroad and intensified the suppression of the people at home. This has further sharpened the class contradictions within India. The broad masses of the Indian people hate the criminal rule of the Indian reactionaries even more. In some places, revolutionary people have taken up arms and launched armed struggles. The great thoughts of Mao Zedong and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are having an increasingly profound influence among the Indian people.

Facing the rapidly developing revolutionary situation in India, the Indian ruling clique is in a state of panic. They foolishly think that by opposing China, they can divert the attention of the Indian people, use anti-China sentiment to resist the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in India and the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and use anti-China sentiment to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to beg for money. In short, they use anti-China sentiment to maintain their extremely rotten reactionary rule.

However, the Indian reactionary government's frenzied anti-China actions absolutely do not threaten the great Chinese people. Even U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, such gigantic entities, are no match for the Chinese people, let alone their lackeys, the Indian reactionaries? The red diplomatic warriors of our embassy in India remained calm and composed in the face of the savage attack by Indian thugs, bravely defending the dignity and honor of the nation. They expressed the will of the 700 million Chinese people, showing the utmost contempt for the Indian reactionaries, and issued the sternest warning to the Indian reactionaries: The Chinese people are not to be trifled with!

The Indian reactionary government's anti-China actions also absolutely cannot divert the Indian people's struggle. The vast majority of the Indian people want to be friendly with the Chinese people. They know very well from personal experience that it is not China but U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and their lackeys, a handful of Indian reactionaries, who oppress, exploit, and enslave them. The ones who are frenziedly anti-China are this handful of big landlords, big bureaucrats, big warlords, and compradors who ride on the backs of the Indian people. Their interests are inseparable from those of imperialism. They are a bunch of traitors, agents of imperialism, and enemies of the Indian people. The more frenziedly the Indian reactionaries are anti-China, the more thoroughly they expose their counter-revolutionary faces, and the more they will be opposed by the Indian people.

Chairman Mao said, "Currently, the biggest imperialist in the world is U.S. imperialism, and in many countries, it has its lackeys. The people whom imperialism supports are precisely the people whom the broad masses despise." These lackeys either have already been overthrown by the people or will be overthrown by the people. The Indian reactionaries are such a handful of people despised by the broad masses of the Indian people. Their frenzied anti-China actions absolutely cannot save their fate but will only hasten the day of their overthrow.

    反华救不了印度反动派的命
    本报评论员
    印度反动政府有组织、有计划地指使大批暴徒侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖，袭击中国大使馆，撕毁中华人民共和国国旗，毒打中国大使馆人员，蓄意制造国际关系史上罕见的暴行。七亿中国人民对于印度反动政府这种疯狂反华的挑衅行为无比愤慨。
    印度反动政府无耻透顶，竟然以中国驱逐印度间谍分子鲁冠南为借口，疯狂反华。鲁冠南披的是印度外交官的外衣，干的是国际间谍的肮脏勾当。这样一个家伙，作案落网，人赃俱获，中国政府当然要依法惩处。不管什么人，不管印度反动政府再派什么人到中国来，只要进行间谍活动，中国政府都要照此办理，任何人都不能阻止中国政府行使这种维护国家主权和安全的权利。
    印度反动政府老羞成怒，不仅把莫须有的罪名加到中国外交官头上，而且悍然践踏国际关系的起码准则，组织暴徒袭击中国大使馆，干下了骇人听闻的罪行。这种无耻的行径，岂是任何一个稍顾体面的政府所能干得出来的吗？
    很清楚，印度反动政府蓄意掀起新的反华浪潮，完全是为了适应它内政外交的需要。
    这一届印度反动政府上台三个多月以来，为了对付严重的经济危机和印度人民的反暴政、争生存的斗争，对外更加投靠美帝苏修，对内加紧压迫人民。这使印度国内的阶级矛盾进一步尖锐化。广大印度人民更加痛恨印度反动派的罪恶统治。一些地方，革命人民已经揭竿而起，展开了武装斗争。伟大的毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化大革命，在印度人民中间产生了越来越深远的影响。
    面对着印度国内迅猛发展的革命形势，印度统治集团惊慌失措。它妄想用反华来转移印度人民的注意，用反华来抵制毛泽东思想在印度的传播和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，用反华来向美帝苏修请功邀赏，要钱讨饭。一句话，用反华来维持它的极端腐朽的反动统治。
    但是，印度反动政府这种疯狂的反华暴行，绝对威胁不了伟大的中国人民。美帝苏修这样的庞然大物都不在中国人民的话下，它们的走卒印度反动派又算得了什么？我国驻印度大使馆的红色外交战士，在印度暴徒的野蛮袭击面前脸不改色心不跳，英勇地捍卫国家的尊严和荣誉。他们表达了七亿中国人民的意志，对印度反动派表示极度的蔑视，并且向印度反动派提出了最严厉的警告：中国人民不可侮！
    印度反动政府的反华暴行，也绝对转移不了印度人民的斗争方向。占印度人口绝大多数的人民是要同中国人民友好的。他们从亲身感受知道得很清楚，压迫他们，剥削他们，奴役他们的并不是中国，而是美帝苏修和它们的走狗一小撮印度反动派。疯狂反华的就是这一小撮骑在印度人民头上的大地主、大官僚、大军阀、大买办，他们的利益是同帝国主义的利益分不开的。他们是一伙卖国贼，是帝国主义的代理人，是印度人民的死敌。印度反动派反华越猖狂，就把自己的反革命嘴脸暴露得越彻底，他们就将越加遭到印度人民的反对。
    毛主席说，“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。”这些走狗或者已经被人民所推翻，或者将要被人民所推翻。印度反动派就是这样一小撮被广大印度人民所唾弃的家伙。他们疯狂反华，绝对挽救不了他们的命运，而只能使他们被推翻的日子更快地到来。
