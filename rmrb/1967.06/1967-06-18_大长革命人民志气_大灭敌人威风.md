Exciting news has come: China's first hydrogen bomb has successfully exploded! This is another great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought! This is another brilliant achievement of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! The revolutionary rebel workers of Shanghai enthusiastically celebrate this great victory!

Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao said: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, and do not evade problems but solve them with a positive attitude, any difficulty in the world can be overcome." It is under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that we have finally overcome all difficulties in manufacturing the hydrogen bomb and have realized ahead of schedule our great leader Chairman Mao's call to develop atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and has greatly crushed the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. This great victory strongly supports the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting the anti-American, national salvation war, and supports the Arab people who are resisting the aggression of American and British imperialism and their tool, Israel. This great victory is a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is entering its decisive battle, the successful explosion of the first hydrogen bomb has greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses nationwide and has dealt a heavy blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The successful explosion of the first hydrogen bomb has also greatly strengthened China's national defense and further consolidated China's proletarian dictatorship.

The hydrogen bomb is the most powerful weapon among nuclear weapons, and now the Chinese people have mastered it. However, we have an even more powerful spiritual weapon, which is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao said: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force and an incredibly powerful spiritual atomic bomb." With such a spiritual atomic bomb in our hands, we can defeat all enemies and create all miracles in the world!

In this favorable situation, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is guiding the cultural revolution in Shanghai to a new situation. We Shanghai revolutionary workers are actively implementing the decision of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee "To Struggle for the Strengthening of the Proletarian Dictatorship," holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carrying out the revolutionary criticism, promoting revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units. On this joyous day of national celebration, we are determined to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses nationwide, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    大长革命人民志气　大灭敌人威风
    上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人　王洪文
    激动人心的消息传来：我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！这是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的又一辉煌成果！上海的工人革命造反派最最热烈地欢呼这一伟大胜利！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难都是可以解决的。”正是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，我们终于克服了制造氢弹的各种困难，提前实现了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于发展原子弹、氢弹的伟大号召。
    我国第一颗氢弹的爆炸成功，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的威风。这一伟大胜利，有力地支持了正在英勇进行抗美救国战争的越南人民，支持了正在反抗美英帝国主义及其工具以色列侵略的阿拉伯人民。这一伟大胜利，对于帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派是一个沉重的打击。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命进入总决战的关键时刻，第一颗氢弹的爆炸成功，对于全国无产阶级革命派是极大的鼓舞，对于党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是狠狠的当头一棒。第一颗氢弹的爆炸成功，还大大加强了我国的国防，进一步巩固了我国的无产阶级专政。
    氢弹是核武器当中最厉害的武器，现在，中国人民已经掌握了。但是，我们有更厉害的精神武器，这就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。林副主席说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”我们掌握了这样的精神原子弹，就能战胜一切敌人，就能创造出一切人间的奇迹！
    上海的无产阶级革命派在大好形势下，兴起了一个更大的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。毛泽东思想指引着上海的文化大革命出现了新局面。我们上海的工人革命派正积极贯彻执行市革命委员会《为加强无产阶级专政而斗争》的决议，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步搞好革命的大批判，促进革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，开展本单位的斗批改。在这举国欢庆的日子里，我们决心进一步活学活用毛主席著作，和全国无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，为争取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而奋斗！
