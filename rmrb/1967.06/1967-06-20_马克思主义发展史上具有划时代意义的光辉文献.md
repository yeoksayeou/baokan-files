The nation's military and civilians solemnly commemorate the 10th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

Billions of revolutionary masses and broad cadres and soldiers express their determination to study and apply this brilliant work, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, achieve great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in the great criticism, and carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is the most powerful ideological weapon guiding the nation's billions of revolutionary masses in the unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution. Revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary groups in Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shanxi, Shandong, and other places have held memorial meetings, experience-sharing sessions, and extensive learning activities to solemnly commemorate the 10th anniversary of Chairman Mao's great work and enthusiastically welcome the re-publication of this great work.

Revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary groups in various places pointed out that Chairman Mao's great work, which has epoch-making significance in the development of Marxism, is an important milestone in the development of Marxism to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought, and is a great program for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They expressed their determination to seriously study Chairman Mao's great work and the theories, lines, policies, and guidelines proposed by Chairman Mao on the great proletarian cultural revolution, to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to deepen the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to achieve the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the "three-in-one combination," and to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee today solemnly held a meeting to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work. Over ten thousand revolutionary masses from various fronts exchanged experiences in studying and applying this great work. Zhou Jingfang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, said in his speech at the meeting that various revolutionary mass organizations should, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, take Chairman Mao's work as a guide, combine it with the study of the May 16th Circular of the Central Committee, carry out rectification, summarize the experience of the great proletarian cultural revolution over the past year, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, better grasp the direction of the struggle, transform the objective world while transforming their subjective world, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Nearly three thousand revolutionary masses from the central directly-affiliated cultural system, who have united in the great criticism, also held a solemn meeting today. The broad revolutionary cultural warriors present expressed their determination to study and apply this brilliant work, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and clearly and unambiguously direct the spearhead of the struggle towards the counter-revolutionary revisionist heads of the cultural circle such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Moquan, Qi Yanming, and Xiao Wangdong, and their ultimate backer—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At the meeting, representatives from some units shared their experiences and feelings of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and achieving great unity among revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought using the method of "unity-criticism-unity."

More than ten thousand revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and military cadres and soldiers from various fronts in Shanghai held a solemn memorial meeting today with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao. Xu Jingxian of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee gave a long speech at the meeting. He said that Chairman Mao's great work creatively developed the dialectical materialism and the theories of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat of Marxism-Leninism. It is the first time in the history of proletarian revolution that it expounded the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, laying the theoretical foundation for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a great milestone in the third stage of the development of Marxism, namely the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. This brilliant work is also an important guide for the current great proletarian cultural revolution in our country. Xu Jingxian said that we must better study and apply this great historical document, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, better achieve great unity, promote the great criticism and the "three-in-one combination," and advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Representatives of the revolutionary masses of workers and peasants in Shanghai introduced at the meeting their experiences and feelings of distinguishing between enemies and friends through studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and other brilliant works of Chairman Mao, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, carrying forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and promoting great unity.

In Harbin, a solemn memorial meeting was held today by the broad Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and military cadres and soldiers. Pan Fusheng, the chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that through a year of struggle and combined with the study of Chairman Mao's great work, it is necessary to correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions in the great proletarian cultural revolution, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate on solving the main contradiction—the contradiction between the broad revolutionary masses and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and not be distracted by various secondary contradictions, which would divert the direction of the struggle. If the direction is wrong, then everything is wrong. Pan Fusheng also said that our policy is a policy of "a million soldiers and horses," not a policy of "a lone individual." We must take the leftists as the core, unite all forces that can be united, form a vast revolutionary army, and more concentratedly and powerfully strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Representatives of the revolutionary masses from various fronts in Harbin shared their experiences and feelings of studying and applying this great work at the meeting. They expressed their determination to take this great work as a guide, carry out rectification, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, overcome various bourgeois ideas and styles such as anarchism, individualism, factionalism, and mountainism, and strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary ranks.

More than ten thousand revolutionary masses and military cadres and soldiers from the Guizhou region held a solemn gathering on the evening of the 18th. Li Zaichan, the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, vice political commissar of the Kunming Military Region, and first political commissar of the Guizhou Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He said that Chairman Mao's epoch-making work is the guiding principle for our country's great socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it has practical guiding significance for the great proletarian cultural revolution that is currently underway. Li Zaichan called on the revolutionary masses and revolutionary groups throughout the province to seriously study, deeply understand, and correctly apply Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," this most sharp ideological weapon, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Representatives of workers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres also spoke at the meeting. The meeting also read out the notice from the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee on studying Chairman Mao's epoch-making work.

In recent days, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary groups from Shanxi, Shandong, and other places have also held experience-sharing sessions and discussion meetings to solemnly commemorate the 10th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work. Li Shunda, a famous labor model in the country and the chairman of the Pingxian County Revolutionary Committee, said that reviewing the revolutionary struggles we have personally experienced over the past ten years, it has been completely proven that the scientific propositions put forward by Chairman Mao in this brilliant work are extremely wise and correct. In the future, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's great work, and push socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new high. The revolutionary youngsters of the Shandong Red Guard Command said that by studying Chairman Mao's great work, we must grasp the main contradiction, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At the same time, we must take Chairman Mao's brilliant work as a guide, strengthen our revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the brilliant document "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" published by our great leader Chairman Mao ten years ago has caused a great stir among the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China after its re-publication today. The entire army unanimously pointed out that this brilliant document is a great program for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, an important milestone in the development of Marxism to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought, and has extremely important significance for achieving the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, achieving the "three-in-one combination," carrying out the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the current stage of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Air Force, Navy, Railway Corps, Engineering Corps, Artillery Corps, and the military units in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Guizhou, Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia have held celebration meetings, memorial meetings, discussion meetings, and experience-sharing sessions today. Air Force leaders Wu Fazheng, Yu Lijin, and seven thousand cadres and soldiers together recited Chairman Mao's quotations at the celebration meeting. Yu Lijin spoke at the meeting, calling on the Air Force cadres and soldiers to immediately launch a high tide of studying and propagating this brilliant work, closely combine it with the practical struggle of the current cultural revolution, study to a new level, and apply to a new level. The Navy cadres and soldiers also passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao at the celebration meeting, pledging to Chairman Mao: to better study and apply this brilliant work, correctly handle the two types of contradictions, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end. The broad cadres and soldiers of the military units in the Guizhou region expressed their determination at the memorial meetings, discussion meetings, and experience-sharing sessions to more seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work and contribute their greatest efforts to carrying the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The broad cadres and soldiers, while celebrating the 10th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," have a particularly deep understanding of the great epoch-making significance of this brilliant work. Beijing Military Region leader Huang Zhenchang pointed out at the celebration meeting that Chairman Mao's brilliant work is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism with epoch-making significance, an extremely important guide for us to successfully carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution, and a powerful ideological weapon to oppose modern revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Cadres and soldiers fighting on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant work is our compass of revolution. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, more firmly support the revolutionary leftists, more powerfully promote the great unity and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, and better complete the glorious tasks of "three supports" and "two militaries." The broad cadres and soldiers of the Three Services stationed in Shanghai also encouraged each other at the memorial meeting with the local revolutionary masses: we must firmly hold the gun and the pen, and swear to defend the proletarian state for eternity. They said: "This brilliant work is our guiding light for supporting the left, and the golden key to solving all problems in the work of supporting the left."

Revolutionary masses in military academies and cultural and sports units, which are vigorously carrying out the great proletarian cultural revolution, expressed their determination to strictly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and forever advance along the revolutionary direction indicated by Chairman Mao, to strive for new victories in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

The cadres and soldiers of the Four Good Company Guard Platoon of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region recently held an experience-sharing session to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and invited the left-support personnel to share their learning experiences and feelings.
