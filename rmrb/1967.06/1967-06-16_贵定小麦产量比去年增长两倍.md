The ethnic minority poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Guiding County, Guizhou Province, have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have used Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and have achieved a bumper harvest of summer grain. According to preliminary verification, this year's wheat production in the entire county has doubled compared to last year, and the yield per unit area has also increased.

This year, wheat production in this county has increased in both flat fields and mountainous areas. The eight communes in the remote mountainous area of Xinchang District have increased their total wheat production by more than three times compared to last year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically say: This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    贵定小麦产量比去年增长两倍
    贵州省贵定县各族贫下中农和革命干部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，获得了夏粮大丰收。据初步核实，今年全县的小麦产量比去年增长两倍，单位面积产量也有所提高。
    今年这个县的小麦，不论是田坝或是山区，普遍增产。地处边远山区的新场区八个公社，今年小麦总产量比去年增长三倍多。广大贫下中农兴奋地说：这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。　（据新华社讯）
