More than 20,000 construction workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon stop work to protest British oppression

	According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 15th, more than 20,000 workers from eleven construction industries, including plastering, carpentry, and painting in Hong Kong and Kowloon, stopped work for a day on the 14th to protest the British imperialists' bloody suppression of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots' fascist atrocities.

	The British authorities, in order to sabotage the construction workers' strike, shamelessly colluded with the employers and sent agents to threaten the workers with dismissal and arrest. Workers armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought foiled the British authorities' plots. Chinese workers, including those working in British military camps, British ships, and American enterprises, successfully carried out the strike.

	Workers participating in the strike held denunciation meetings in their unions on the 14th to condemn the British atrocities. They expressed their determination to firmly respond to the call of the great motherland, to further mobilize and organize, and to launch a revolutionary mass movement to hate, despise, and scorn British imperialism, resolutely countering the oppression and provocation of British imperialism.

	According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 15th, the heinous British imperialists' brutal murder of the patriotic workers Xu Tianbo and Li Song in the "June 8" massacre has aroused the extreme indignation of the Chinese workers and compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. People are seething with hatred and roaring with anger: We vow to avenge Xu Tianbo and Li Song! We vow to fight and overthrow British imperialism!

	Gas workers and workers and family members of the political and military medical institutions under the British authorities held denunciation meetings on the 13th to condemn the British authorities' murder of Li Song and Xu Tianbo. They, together with workers from various industries and representatives from various circles who attended the meeting, strongly denounced the British authorities' heinous crimes.

    香港同胞反迫害斗争烈火越烧越旺
    两万多建筑行业工人联合停工
    据新华社香港十五日电　港九泥水、木工、油漆等十一个建筑行业的二万多名工人，十四日联合停工一天，抗议港英帝国主义血腥镇压香港中国同胞的法西斯暴行。
    港英当局为了破坏建筑行业工人的停工斗争，无耻地勾结资方和派出特务，以解雇和逮捕来对工人进行威胁。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国工人，粉碎了港英当局的阴谋诡计。包括在英军军营、英国货船以及美资企业内工作的中国工人都胜利地举行了停工。
    参加停工斗争的工人，十四日在工会分别举行了控诉港英暴行的誓师大会。他们表示要坚决响应伟大祖国的号召，进一步动员起来，组织起来，开展仇视、鄙视、蔑视英帝国主义的革命群众运动，坚决反击港英帝国主义的迫害和挑衅。
    据新华社香港十五日电　万恶的港英帝国主义在“六·八”大血案中残暴杀害我爱国工人徐田波和黎松的法西斯血腥暴行，激起了港九中国工人和各界爱国同胞的无比愤慨。人们切齿痛恨，振臂怒吼：誓为徐田波、黎松报仇！誓把港英帝国主义斗垮，斗臭！
    煤气工人和港英所属政军医机构的工人和家属，十三日就港英当局杀害黎松、徐田波分别举行控诉大会。他们和参加大会的各业工人、各界同胞代表一起，强烈控诉港英当局的滔天罪行。
