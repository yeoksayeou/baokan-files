Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Chinese military and people, sends a telegram to Comrade Vo Nguyen Giap to warmly congratulate the glorious achievement of the Vietnamese people in shooting down 2,000 U.S. aircraft.

New China News Agency, June 9th: Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao today sent a telegram to General Vo Nguyen Giap, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to congratulate the Vietnamese military and people on the glorious achievement of shooting down 2,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To General Vo Nguyen Giap,
	Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,

	Dear Comrade Minister:

	In the great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the fraternal Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army have, by June 5th, achieved the glorious feat of shooting down 2,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft. On behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and in my personal capacity, I extend my warmest congratulations and highest respect to you and the heroic Vietnamese military and people for this achievement!

	The Vietnamese people in the north, by sending 2,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft to their doom, and the Vietnamese people in the south, by achieving significant victories in the dry-season campaigns, have greatly dampened the arrogance of the U.S. aggressors and greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary people around the world. This is a brilliant victory for people's war and a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' efforts to escalate the war.

	At present, the Vietnamese people have firmly grasped the initiative in the war, while the U.S. aggressors are everywhere on the defensive and in a very precarious situation. Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "What is the real steel wall? It is the people, the hundreds of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution." "Mobilizing the entire population creates a vast ocean that can drown the enemy." The continuous victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation demonstrate that people's war is the most effective weapon for defeating U.S. imperialism, this gigantic monster.

	The U.S. imperialists vainly hope to find a way out by escalating the war, but their delusions will never be realized. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army, under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, will respond to any military adventures by the U.S. aggressors and their accomplices with even heavier blows. The final victory will surely belong to the indomitable Vietnamese people.

	The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation as our sacred internationalist duty. We will closely monitor the developments in Vietnam and be ready to take necessary actions at any time, as requested by the Vietnamese government and people. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists escalate the war or how far they expand the war, the Chinese people are determined to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the very end!

	We wish the fraternal Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army continued new and greater victories in their great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!

	Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China,
	Lin Biao

	June 9, 1967, Beijing

    林彪同志代表中国军民致电武元甲同志
    热烈祝贺越南击落美机二千架的辉煌战绩
    新华社九日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪今天打电报给越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，祝贺越南军民取得击落美国强盗飞机二千架的辉煌战绩。电报的全文如下：越南民主共和国副总理兼
    国防部长武元甲大将亲爱的部长同志：
    兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军战友们，在伟大的抗美救国斗争中，到六月五日，已经取得了击落美国强盗飞机二千架的辉煌战绩。对此，我谨代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，并以我个人的名义，向你和英雄的越南军民表示最热烈的祝贺和致以最崇高的敬意！
    越南北方军民把二千架美国强盗飞机葬身火海和越南南方军民旱季作战中接连取得的重大战果，大灭了美国侵略者的威风，大长了各国革命人民的志气。这是人民战争的光辉胜利，是对美帝国主义加紧战争“升级”行动的沉重打击。
    目前，越南人民已经牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权，美国侵略军则处处被动挨打，处境十分狼狈。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”。全体越南人民在抗美救国斗争中接连取得的辉煌胜利表明，人民战争，是置美帝国主义这个庞然大物于死地的最有效的法宝。
    美帝国主义妄图通过加紧战争“升级”行动来寻找一条出路，它的这种痴心妄想，是永远不会得逞的。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民和越南人民军战友们，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的正确领导下，必将以加倍的沉重打击来回答美国侵略者及其帮凶的任何军事冒险。最后胜利，必定属于英勇不屈的越南人民。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己神圣的国际主义义务，并将密切注视越南形势的发展，随时准备根据越南政府和人民的要求，采取必要的行动。不论美帝国主义把侵略战争升多少级，把侵略战火扩大到多大范围，中国人民都决心把支持越南人民的伟大抗美救国斗争进行到底！
    祝兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军战友们在伟大的抗美救国斗争中继续取得新的更大胜利！
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长
                                    林彪
                一九六七年六月九日　于北京
