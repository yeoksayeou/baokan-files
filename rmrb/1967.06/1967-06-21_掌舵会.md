In early April, when we were resuming classes and making revolution, concentrating our efforts to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, a few misled masses spread rumors and slandered the revolutionary faction. At that time, the Red Guards Brigade Committee of our school held an emergency meeting and decided to give a resolute counterattack in all classes throughout the school.

Just at this moment, the deputy battalion commander of the People's Liberation Army, who was conducting military and political training in our school, came. After understanding the situation, he, as usual, kindly said to us, "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and the growth of all things relies on the sun. Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought! We must never leave Mao Zedong Thought, the helm! Let's have a steering meeting together!"

The deputy battalion commander first led us to study the editorial "Firmly Grasp the General Direction of the Struggle" from the *People's Liberation Army Daily*, and then said, "Compare what you are doing with the general direction proposed in the editorial. Is it appropriate?" At this time, we all spoke at once, "To achieve the great alliance of the revolution and thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the general direction of the current struggle." The deputy battalion commander then said, "Based on this analysis, how do you think your decision is?" Everyone said, "It is not appropriate." The deputy battalion commander then asked, "So, what should we do?" Everyone unanimously said, "Study Chairman Mao's works!" We opened the *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and loudly read:

"In any process where there are multiple contradictions, there must be one that is principal, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are secondary and subordinate. Therefore, when studying any process where there are two or more contradictions, one must use all efforts to find the principal contradiction. Once the principal contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved."

Chairman Mao's teachings made us see clearly. We enthusiastically discussed what the principal contradiction is at present. The result was that everyone agreed that the principal contradiction at present is between us and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. There is also a contradiction between us and the misled masses, but it is a contradiction within the people and is subordinate to the principal contradiction. We should grasp the principal contradiction and firmly hold the general direction of the struggle.

The deputy battalion commander, seeing that we had unified our thinking, happily said, "Today's steering meeting was well done! Everyone actively learns and applies Mao Zedong Thought, educates oneself, and liberates oneself. I firmly support you! I hope you will have more such steering meetings in the future and always keep Mao Zedong Thought, the helm, steady."

From then on, holding steering meetings became one of our regular practices. Whenever new problems or difficulties arose on our forward march, we held steering meetings, firmly grasping the criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and combining this great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our school, truly realizing Chairman Mao's great call to "resume classes and make revolution."

### “掌舵会”

    “掌舵会”
    四月初，正当我们复课闹革命，集中力量向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火的时候，少数受蒙蔽的群众散布流言蜚语，攻击革命派。当时，我校红卫兵大队委员会召开了紧急会议，决定要在全校各班全面给予坚决的回击。
    就在这个时候，在我校进行军政训练的解放军的副营长来了，他了解一下情况，就象往常一样，亲切地对我们说：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想！我们任何时候也不能离开毛泽东思想这个舵！我们在一起开个掌舵会吧！”
    副营长先领着我们学习了《解放军报》社论《紧紧掌握斗争的大方向》，然后说：“你们对照社论上提出的大方向，好好考虑一下，你们这样做合适不合适？”这时，我们七嘴八舌地说：“实现革命的大联合，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是当前斗争的大方向。”这时，副营长说：“根据这种分析，你们再看一看你们的决定怎么样？”大家都说：“不合适。”副营长又问：“那我们应该怎么办呢？”大家异口同声地说：“请教毛主席著作！”我们打开了《毛主席语录》，高声念道：
    “任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    毛主席的教导，使我们豁然开朗。我们热烈地讨论什么是当前的主要矛盾？结果，大家一致认为，当前的主要矛盾是我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，我们同受蒙蔽的群众之间也有矛盾，但是属于人民内部矛盾，而且是从属于主要矛盾的。我们应当抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
    副营长看到我们统一了思想认识，非常高兴地说：“今天这个掌舵会开得好！大家活学活用毛泽东思想，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，我坚决支持你们！希望你们今后多开这样的掌舵会，时刻把稳毛泽东思想这个舵。”
    从此，开掌舵会就成了我们的一项制度，每当在前进的道路上出现新的问题、遇到困难，我们就开掌舵会，紧紧地抓住对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的批判，并把这场大批判同我校的斗批改结合起来，真正实现毛主席发出的“复课闹革命”的伟大号召。
