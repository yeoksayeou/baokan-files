As the nation solemnly commemorates the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, pushing the revolutionary criticism and struggle to new heights, we are delighted to see that the revolutionary rebels of the capital's colleges and universities have further united and joined forces.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "National unity, unity of the people, and unity among the various nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the success of our cause." Achieving the broadest possible revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core is the basic guarantee for the success of the Cultural Revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

A common struggle objective is the prerequisite for revolutionary unity. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists entrenched in certain places, departments, and units, are the common enemies of the broad masses of revolutionary rebels and revolutionary people. With the enemy at our doorstep, we must fight. This is the big principle. All small principles should be subordinate to this big principle. We should prioritize the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, uphold the spirit of selflessness of the proletariat, and unite and join forces with all revolutionary forces that can be united to fiercely strike at the handful of most important and dangerous enemies under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Is it necessary to have "identical views and no contradictions" to unite? No. Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no such thing as something that does not contain contradictions, and without contradictions there is no world." It is not surprising that revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary masses have different views and contradictions on certain issues. Experience shows that these contradictions, if handled properly, will not affect the realization of revolutionary unity on the premise of common struggle against the enemy. We can completely solve these contradictions step by step through the method of "unity-criticism-unity." In this process, we can continuously consolidate, develop, and perfect the revolutionary unity. If we hope to unify all different opinions by 100% before uniting, that is metaphysical and would never achieve unity.

Small-groupism, anarchism, sectarianism, and individualism in the revolutionary ranks are the main obstacles to achieving the broadest possible revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core. These must be overcome.

The key issue is guiding the masses. We must use Mao Zedong Thought and the worldview of the proletarian revolution to guide our ranks and transform our ranks. Every revolutionary cadre and leader of revolutionary mass organizations should be fully aware of this issue. If we mistakenly regard small-bourgeois thoughts and behaviors as proletarian revolutionary nature, if we allow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts to spread freely in our ranks, and are keen on "forming factions," "fighting internal wars," and "splitting" within and between revolutionary organizations, while ignoring the revolutionary direction, that is very dangerous. It would mean committing errors in direction and line, being exploited by class enemies, and leading the revolutionary ranks astray.

We believe that the proletarian revolutionaries who have grown up under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely achieve the broadest possible revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core, definitely grasp the direction of the struggle, seize the "private" in our minds, achieve ideological revolutionization, and advance the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

    联合起来，共同对敌
    本报评论员
    在全国人民隆重纪念毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把革命的大批判、大斗争推向新的高潮的时候，我们高兴地看到，首都大专院校的无产阶级革命派进一步团结起来，联合起来了。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，就是无产阶级文化大革命必定要胜利的基本保证。
    共同的斗争目标是革命的大联合的前提。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和盘踞在某些地方、某些部门、某些单位的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，他们是广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的共同敌人。大敌当前，需要我们去斗争。这就是大道理，大原则。一切小道理，小原则都应当服从这个大道理、大原则。我们应当以无产阶级的革命事业为重，发扬无产阶级大公无私的精神，把一切可以团结的革命力量都团结起来，联合起来，狠狠打击无产阶级专政下这一小撮最主要、最危险的敌人。
    是不是“观点一致，没有矛盾，才能联合”呢？不是。毛主席教导我们：“没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界。”革命群众组织之间，革命群众之间在某些问题上有不同的看法，存在着分歧，是并不奇怪的。经验证明，这些分歧如果处理得当，并不会影响在共同对敌的前提下，实现革命的大联合。我们完全可以通过“团结——批评——团结”的方式，使矛盾逐步地得到解决。并且在这个过程中，使革命的大联合不断巩固，不断发展，不断完善。如果希望把所有的不同意见百分之百地统一起来再联合，那是形而上学的，那就永远也实现不了大联合。
    革命队伍中的小团体主义，无政府主义，宗派主义，个人主义等非无产阶级思想，是实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合的主要障碍。这些东西，必须克服。
    重要的问题在于引导群众。我们必须用毛泽东思想，用无产阶级革命的世界观来引导我们的队伍，改造我们的队伍。每一个革命干部，革命群众组织的负责人，对这个问题都应该有充分的自觉。如果错误地把小资产阶级的思想和行为，当作无产阶级革命性，如果听任资产阶级、小资产阶级思想在我们队伍中自由泛滥，热中于革命组织内部和革命组织之间“拉山头”，“打内战”，“搞分裂”，而置革命的大方向于不顾，那是很危险的，那就可能重犯方向和路线的错误，就可能被阶级敌人所利用，就会把革命的队伍带到邪路上去。
    我们相信，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下成长起来的无产阶级革命派，一定能够实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，一定能够紧紧掌握斗争大方向，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，实现思想革命化，把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进！
