Editor's Note: The revolutionary masses of the leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have used the method of class analysis to correctly handle cadres. This experience is very important.

Chairman Mao teaches us to use the perspective of class and class struggle, and the method of class analysis to view and analyze everything. When dealing with leading cadres, it should also be this way. We cannot use a simple method of rejecting everything and denying everything, and generally direct the spearhead of the struggle towards cadres who bear more responsibility and manage more affairs, towards the "number one in command." Ultimately, there are only two kinds of those in power: either they are in Chairman Mao's command or in the black command of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party; either they are proletarian leaders or capitalist-roaders in power. There are no super-class leaders.

How do we distinguish between these two kinds of leaders in power? We must look at whether they support Chairman Mao, whether they support Mao Zedong Thought, and look at their entire history and all their work, especially at critical junctures, to see if they stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In short, we must look at the big picture, look at the main trend.

The revolutionary masses of the Air Force leadership organs have decisively acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thereby distinguishing between friends and enemies and grasping the direction of the struggle. They dare to rebel, dare to make revolution, and dare to fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to disgrace the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. Towards the proletarian leaders, they dare to trust, dare to support, and dare to protect. Proletarian leaders also have various shortcomings and mistakes, which need to be criticized, but this is an internal contradiction among the people, and they cannot be treated like enemies and overthrown.

The revolutionary masses of the leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have decisively responded to the call of Vice Commander Lin Biao to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the struggle, they have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use" aspect, and have decisively acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, achieving major victories in the cultural revolution of the Air Force leadership organs. Not long ago, they held a meeting to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, summarizing and exchanging new experiences of learning in the struggle and using in the struggle. They unanimously felt that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought and the best battlefield for using Mao Zedong Thought to fight. In the complex and sharp struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, there are thousands of things, tens of thousands of things, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the top priority; it is the most important thing among thousands and tens of thousands of things to strive to learn, resolutely implement, actively propagate, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "Mao Zedong Thought in the heart, the direction is correct and there are many methods; Mao Zedong Thought in the chest, endless power comes rolling in. As long as we decisively act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will always move from victory to victory."

Learning Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle, distinguishing between friends and enemies, and clarifying the direction of the struggle

The revolutionary masses of the Air Force leadership organs said that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the first problem we encountered was how to distinguish between friends and enemies. Whose lives are we really trying to change? Whose rebellion are we really trying to make? Where should the spearhead of the struggle be directed? Some people directed the spearhead at cadres who were good in major matters but had shortcomings in minor matters; some people directed the spearhead at the so-called "power holders," that is, cadres who bore more responsibility and managed more affairs; some people advocated directing the spearhead at the "number one in command" of their own unit, saying that these cadres were the "real power holders," with the "most potential." Some people said, "The spearhead of the struggle should be directed at those in power," and they "suspected everything, overthrew everything," saying that "there were no good ones among those in power," and that "as long as we fight those in power, the general direction will not be wrong." Are these actions and statements correct? We brought these questions to Chairman Mao's works for consultation. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." The "Sixteen Points" clearly stipulated: "The focus of this movement is to criticize and repudiate those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." Chairman Mao teaches us to use the perspective of class and class struggle, and the method of class analysis to view and analyze everything. We use this political microscope to look at problems, and we quickly exposed the "suspect everything, overthrow everything" proposal as the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, as the conspiracy of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, who attempted to "strike a large area and protect a small area," deliberately muddy the waters to protect the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, teaches us that class and class struggle are the total root of all class society phenomena. If we observe social phenomena without this total root, we will not be able to observe them correctly, and we will observe them wrongly. There are various kinds of those in power, but from the perspective of class, ultimately there are only two kinds: either they are in Chairman Mao's command or in the black command of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party; either they are proletarian leaders or capitalist-roaders in power. There are no super-class leaders. We must use the method of class analysis to distinguish between the two kinds of leaders in power and direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. How do we distinguish between the two kinds of leaders in power? We must look at the big picture, use politics as the standard, see if they support Chairman Mao, see if they emphasize proletarian politics, and see if they have revolutionary spirit. Among the proletarian leaders, some are good in both the big picture and minor matters; some are good in the big picture but have shortcomings and mistakes in minor matters. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party are very bad in the big picture, and most of them are also very bad in minor matters; but there are also some who have few minor problems, and these people are hypocrites, false gentlemen, and two-faced people, who sometimes can deceive some of the masses. If we do not focus on the big picture but focus on minor matters, we may let this kind of enemy escape, while mistakenly injuring our own people, and be used by the class enemy. Only by focusing on the big picture can we correctly distinguish between the two commands, unite true friends, attack true enemies, grasp the direction of the struggle, and concentrate our efforts to fight the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

Learning Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, daring to rebel and "protect," and insisting on the direction of the struggle

The revolutionary masses of the Air Force leadership organs said that the development of the movement, as pointed out in the "Sixteen Points," is that "since the cultural revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance." This resistance is still quite strong in a certain period. The revolutionary masses, in using the perspective of class and class struggle to expose the conspiracy of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to "strike a large area and protect a small area," and clarifying the direction of the struggle, can we break through the resistance, withstand the backlash, and insist on the direction of the struggle? This depends on whether we have the spirit of "daring." We must dare to make revolution, dare to rebel, and dare to insist on the truth. We must dare to rebel and dare to "protect." Towards the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, we dare to make revolution; towards the proletarian leaders who insist on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we dare to protect. We dare to "strike a small area" and dare to "liberate a large area," uniting the majority. That is to say, towards the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, no matter how high their position is or how powerful they are, we must decisively fight them, decisively fight them down, fight them to ruin, and fight them to disgrace; but towards the proletarian leaders, we decisively trust them and support them. They are people in Chairman Mao's command, political representatives of the proletariat, and precious assets of the Party and the people. We support their correct aspects, not their shortcomings and mistakes. We also expose and criticize their shortcomings and mistakes. But we pay special attention to strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions. Towards the shortcomings and mistakes of the proletarian leaders, we insist on handling them according to Chairman Mao's correct principles for handling internal contradictions among the people. We are not like dealing with enemies, wanting to overthrow them. So we both "burn" and "protect" them, or first "burn" and then "protect" them. When we do this, some people who oppose us call us "royalists." We still dare to "protect." The hat of "royalist" cannot be put on our heads. Because we protect the people in Chairman Mao's command, we protect Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and we protect Chairman Mao's correct policy of "uniting the majority and striking a small area."

The spirit of "daring" comes from "public interest," and only by being selfless can we be fearless. To be daring, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," break private interests and establish public interests. While fighting the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, we must strive to fight the "private" in our own minds; while fighting down the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, these enemies, we must also fight down the "private" enemy in our own minds. When we rise up to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, they bring out "Cultivation" and ask us to "bend over backwards to accommodate." We learn the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and reply: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." To defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we fear neither heaven nor earth, we fear neither life nor death, we fear nothing, and we must "struggle to be complete." We seek the completeness of Mao Zedong Thought! When the struggle is at its most difficult, we have heard some "advice" from some quarters, such as "a good man does not take immediate losses" and "don't be too stubborn." We reply: We think of Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, with a heart for the public, and whether it is a loss or not, if it is a loss, a good man is not afraid of taking "immediate losses." "A thorough materialist is fearless!" "Even if we are skinned alive, we dare to pull the emperor off his horse!"

To insist on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must be willing to take even the biggest losses. Defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means being stubborn. We feel that as long as the "public" is in command in our minds, we will definitely have true courage. Individualism, seeking fame, and anarchism's "daring" is not true courage. It is not standing on the side of "public interest" to rebel, but standing on the side of "private interest" to rebel, which will make the more we rebel, the more we will be "rebelled against," and we will be used by counter-revolutionaries, and may even become counter-revolutionaries. Only by faithfully listening to Chairman Mao's words, "everything from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups," can we insist on the direction of the struggle and become brave warriors loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Learning Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts, insisting on uniting the majority, insisting on struggle through words, and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle

The revolutionary masses of the Air Force leadership organs said that after identifying the enemy and daring to struggle against the enemy, if we do not grasp the correct policies and strategies, and do not have the correct methods of struggle, we still cannot fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to disgrace the enemy. Chairman Mao said: "Our task is to cross the river, but without a bridge or a boat, we cannot cross. If we do not solve the problem of the bridge or the boat, crossing the river is just empty talk." To fight down the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, we must have correct strategies and methods of struggle. We brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's works and related editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and "Liberation Army Daily," and constantly improved our policy level. Only by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to pay attention to uniting all those who can be united, uniting the broadest masses, can we complete the glorious tasks of one fight, two criticisms, and three reforms. In the struggle, the awakening of the masses is fast and slow, the masses rise up in revolution early and late, and some masses are still deceived by the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie for a certain period. Towards this situation, we insist on "revolution without distinction between early and late," do not discriminate against or strike the deceived masses, but warmly help them, believe that the masses can educate themselves and liberate themselves. In the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, the awakening of the masses is rapidly improved, and the deceived masses quickly awaken, thus uniting an even broader mass of people and forming a surging revolutionary force.

To unite the broadest mass of people, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and implement the Party's policies. We must use struggle through words and not struggle through violence, which is an important policy proposed by Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We resolutely implement this policy, fully using the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big speeches, and big discussions, presenting facts, explaining reasons, and not using corporal punishment or disguised corporal punishment. We strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and never use the methods of dealing with enemies to handle internal contradictions among the people. We did this and were opposed by some people, but we gained the support of the broad masses. We insist on using struggle through words and not struggle through violence because we rely on the masses, trust the masses, because the truth is in the hands of us, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and we believe that the method of struggle through words is completely sufficient to defeat the enemy. The facts have proven that only struggle through words can touch the soul and truly fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to disgrace the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, while achieving the goal of educating the masses.

The fundamental issue is the unlimited love for Chairman Mao and the unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought

The revolutionary masses of the Air Force leadership organs said that we are soldiers of Chairman Mao and fighters, propagandists, and guards of Mao Zedong Thought. We have unlimited love, unlimited faith, unlimited loyalty, and unlimited admiration for the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. At any time, we have only one belief and one determination: unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and resolute defense of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by unlimitedly loving Chairman Mao and being unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and by establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, can we stand firm, see clearly, and fight accurately and fiercely in the stormy waves of the cultural revolution. Only by unlimitedly loving Chairman Mao can we unlimitedly strive to study Chairman Mao's works, study them seriously, diligently, sincerely, and wholeheartedly, without any private thoughts. The more difficult the struggle, the more we must grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works. Only by unlimitedly loving Chairman Mao can we be unlimitedly loyal to acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, implementing and following them sentence by sentence, implementing those we understand and also implementing those we do not understand for the time being. Only by unlimitedly loving Chairman Mao can we vow to defend Chairman Mao, vow to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and vow to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Some comrades said with great emotion that if someone scolds or beats us, we can bear it; but if someone attacks our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, we will not agree a thousand times, we will not agree ten thousand times! We will definitely fight to the end!

The revolutionary masses of the Air Force leadership organs said that the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Because Mao Zedong Thought has the strongest class nature, Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat. We unlimitedly love Chairman Mao, and we find Chairman Mao's every word and every letter comfortable to hear, and we can learn, understand, and apply Chairman Mao's works, and they are effective and victorious in every use and every battle. This is a fundamental issue of class stance and class feelings. Some people can also recite Chairman Mao's quotations, but they make mistakes as soon as they do something, because their fundamental stance is wrong. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party deeply hate Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and they use sticks such as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism" to maliciously oppose the study of Chairman Mao's works, which is also a reflection of their class instincts. Two stances, two attitudes, this is the most fundamental difference in the current struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We must thoroughly settle the accounts of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party's crimes of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary masses of the leadership organs of the Air Force unanimously said that our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is the most brilliant example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Every one of us, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, must learn from the brilliant example of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions, study with questions, study and apply actively, learn and use together, learn first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, focus on the "use" aspect, thoroughly smash the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party's vicious conspiracy to oppose the study of Chairman Mao's works, and strive to achieve new levels of study and application, and strive for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The sky is big, the earth is big, but the determination to follow Chairman Mao to make revolution is even bigger! The mountains move, the seas move, but the red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never move!

    坚决照毛主席指示办事　紧紧地掌握斗争大方向
    ——空军领导机关革命群众交流在文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作的经验
    编者按：人民解放军空军领导机关的革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，采取阶级分析的方法，正确对待干部。这个经验，十分重要。
    毛主席教导我们，要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切、分析一切。对待领导干部，也应当是这样。不能采取排斥一切、否定一切的简单方法，笼统地把斗争矛头指向负责任多、管事多的干部，指向“第一把手”。当权派归根结底，只有两种，或者是毛主席司令部里的，或者是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派那个黑司令部里的；或者是无产阶级当权派，或者是走资本主义道路的当权派。超阶级的当权派是没有的。
    怎样区分这两种当权派呢？就是要看他拥护不拥护毛主席，拥护不拥护毛泽东思想，要看他的全部历史和全部工作，特别是在重要的关节上，看他是不是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一边。总之，要看大节，看主流。
    空军领导机关的革命群众，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，因而分清了敌我，掌握了斗争大方向。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，敢于造反，敢于革命，敢于把他们斗倒斗垮斗臭。对于无产阶级当权派，敢于信任，敢于支持，敢于保护。无产阶级当权派也会有这样那样的缺点错误，需要批评，但这是人民内部矛盾，不能象对待敌人那样，把他们打倒。
    中国人民解放军空军领导机关的革命群众，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，坚决响应林彪副统帅把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，取得了空军领导机关文化大革命的重大胜利。不久以前，他们召开了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用大会，总结、交流了在斗争中学在斗争中用的新经验，一致感到，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是学习毛泽东思想的最好的课堂，是运用毛泽东思想进行战斗的最好的战场。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线复杂尖锐的斗争中，有千件事，万件事，活学活用毛主席著作是头等大事；千重要，万重要，努力学习、坚决贯彻、积极宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想最重要。他们说，毛泽东思想入心窝，方向正确办法多；毛泽东思想在胸怀，无穷力量滚滚来。只要坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，就会永远从胜利走向胜利。
    学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，分清敌我，明确斗争大方向
    空军领导机关的革命群众说，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们首先遇到的是怎样分清敌我的问题。文化大革命到底是革谁的命？造谁的反？斗争矛头究竟应该指向哪里？有人把矛头指向在大节方面很好但是小节方面有缺点的干部；有人把矛头指向所谓“实力派”，即负责任多、管事多的干部；有人主张把矛头指向本单位的第一把手，说这些干部是“真正的当权派”，“最有搞头”。有人说：“斗争矛头就是要指向当权派”，他们“怀疑一切，打倒一切”，说“当权派没有一个好的”，“只要是斗争当权派，大方向就没有错”。这些做法和说法对不对？我们带着问题向毛主席著作请教。毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中明确规定：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”毛主席教导我们，要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法来看待一切，分析一切。我们用这个政治显微镜去看问题，就迅速地识破了“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的主张是资产阶级反动路线，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派搞的阴谋，他们企图“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，故意把水搞浑，以保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派过关。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席教导我们，阶级和阶级斗争是所有阶级社会现象的总的根源。离开了这个总根源去观察社会现象，就观察不出来，就会观察错了。当权派有各种各样，但用阶级观点来看，归根结底是两种：或者是毛主席司令部里的，或者是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派那个黑司令部里的；或者是无产阶级当权派，或者是走资本主义道路的当权派。超阶级的当权派是没有的。我们就是要用阶级分析的方法区分两种当权派，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。如何区分两种当权派？要根据毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件以及林副主席的指示，看大节，要以政治作标准，看他拥护不拥护毛主席，突出不突出无产阶级政治，有没有革命干劲。在无产阶级当权派中，有的大节好，小节也好；有的大节好，小节方面有缺点错误。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大节很坏，绝大多数小节也很坏；但也有的小节问题不多，这种人是笑面虎、伪君子、两面派，有时很能迷惑一些群众。如果不着重看大节而着重看小节，就可能放跑了这一类的敌人，而误伤了自己人，被阶级敌人所利用。只有着重看大节，才能正确地分清两个司令部的人，才能团结真正的朋友，以攻击真正的敌人，掌握斗争的大方向，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    学习毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，破私立公，敢革敢“保”，坚持斗争大方向
    空军领导机关的革命群众说，运动的发展，正如“十六条”中所指出的：“文化革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。”这种阻力，在一定的时期内还是相当大的。革命群众在运用阶级和阶级斗争观点识破了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的阴谋，认清了斗争大方向之后，能不能冲破阻力，顶住逆流，坚持斗争的大方向，这就看有没有一个“敢”字。敢于革命，敢于造反，敢于坚持真理。既敢于革，又敢于“保”，对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，敢于革命，对于坚持毛主席革命路线的无产阶级当权派，敢于保护。既敢于“打击一小撮”，又敢于“解放一大片”，团结大多数。就是说，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不管他职位多高，有多么厉害，都坚决地斗，坚决把他斗倒、斗垮、斗臭；而对无产阶级当权派，我们坚决地信任他们，支持他们。他们是毛主席司令部里的人，是无产阶级的政治代表，是党和人民的宝贵财富。我们支持的是他们的正确方面，而不是他们的缺点错误。对他们的缺点错误，也同样要揭发，要批判。但我们十分注意严格区分两类矛盾。对无产阶级当权派的缺点、错误，我们坚持按照毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则办事。绝不是象对敌人那样，要把他们打倒。所以我们对他们是又烧又“保”，或者是先烧后“保”。当我们这样做的时候，一些反对我们的人骂我们是“保皇派”。我们仍然敢“保”。“保皇派”的帽子是戴不到我们头上的。因为我们保的是毛主席司令部的人，保的是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保的是毛主席“团结大多数，打击一小撮”的正确政策。　
    “敢”字来源于“公”字，无私才能无畏。要做到敢，就要活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公。在斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的同时，努力斗自己头脑里的“私”字；在打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派这些敌人的同时，打倒自己头脑里“私”字这个敌人。当我们起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反的时候，他们捧出《修养》来，要我们“委曲求全”。我们学了“老三篇”，就回答说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”为了保卫毛主席，为了保卫毛泽东思想，为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，我们天不怕，地不怕，死不怕，什么都不怕，就是要“斗争求全”。求毛泽东思想的全！当我们斗争最艰苦的时候，曾听到来自某些方面的一些“劝告”，什么“好汉不吃眼前亏”啦，什么“心眼儿别太死”啦。我们回答说：我们想的是毛主席教导的“完全”、“彻底”为人民，一心为公，什么亏不亏，要说亏，好汉就是不怕吃“眼前亏”，“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”！“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”！
    为了坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是再大的亏也要吃。保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要死心眼。我们体会到，只要脑子里“公”字挂了帅，就一定会有真正的勇敢。个人主义、风头主义、无政府主义的“敢”，不是真正的勇敢。不是站在“公”字的立场上去造反，而是站在“私”字的立场上去造反，就会越造越“反”，就会被反革命分子所利用，甚至可能成为反革命分子。只有忠实地听毛主席的话，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，才能坚持斗争大方向，成为忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的英勇战士。
    学习毛主席的战略策略思想，坚持团结大多数，坚持文斗，紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    空军领导机关的革命群众说，识别了敌人，又敢于和敌人斗争，如果不掌握正确的政策和策略，没有正确的斗争方法，还是不能把敌人斗倒，斗垮，斗臭。毛主席说：“我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。”要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，必须有正确的斗争策略和方法。我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》的有关社论，不断提高政策水平。只有坚决执行毛主席关于要注意团结一切可以团结的人们的指示，团结最广大的群众，才能完成一斗、二批、三改的光荣任务。在斗争中，群众觉悟程度的提高有快有慢，群众起来革命有先有后，有些群众在一定的时期内还受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽。对这种情况，我们坚持“革命不分先后”，对受蒙蔽的群众不歧视，不打击，而是热情帮助，相信群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，群众觉悟得到迅速的提高，受蒙蔽的群众迅速醒悟，这就团结了更广大的群众，形成了浩浩荡荡的革命队伍。
    要团结最广大的群众，就要坚决执行毛主席的指示，执行党的政策。要用文斗，不用武斗，是毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命中的一项重要政策。我们坚决地执行这一政策，充分运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，摆事实，讲道理，不搞体罚或变相体罚。严格区别两类矛盾，决不用对待敌人的方法来处理人民内部矛盾。我们这样做，曾被一些人反对，却得到了广大群众的支持。我们坚持用文斗，不用武斗，是因为我们依靠群众，信任群众，是因为真理掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手里，我们相信文斗的办法完全足以制胜敌人。事实证明，只有文斗，才能触及灵魂，才能真正把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，同时达到教育群众的目的。
    根本问题在于无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想
    空军领导机关的革命群众说，我们是毛主席的战士，是毛泽东思想的战斗员，宣传员，警卫员。我们对心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席怀着无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚，无限崇拜的深厚的阶级感情。我们在任何时刻都只有一个信念，一个决心：无限忠于毛主席，坚决捍卫毛泽东思想。只有无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想在头脑中树立绝对权威，才能在文化大革命的狂风巨浪中站得稳，看得清，打得准，打得狠。无限热爱毛主席，才能无限努力地去学习毛主席著作，认真地学，刻苦地学，诚心诚意地学，全心全意地学，不带任何私心杂念去学。斗争再艰苦，《毛主席语录》不离手；斗争越紧张，越是抓紧学习毛主席著作。无限热爱毛主席，才能无限忠诚地去照毛主席指示办事，句句执行、句句照办，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行。无限热爱毛主席，才能誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。有的同志怀着无比激动的感情说，谁要是打我骂我，我都可以不计较；但是，谁要是攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们坚决和他拚！
    空军领导机关的革命群众说，对待毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的分水岭。因为毛泽东思想具有最强烈的阶级性，毛泽东思想是我们无产阶级革命战士的命根子。我们无限热爱毛主席，对毛主席的每句话、每个字都听得舒服，对毛主席著作就会一学就懂，一学就通，一学就用，一用就灵，百用百效，百战百胜。这是根本的阶级立场、阶级感情问题。有的人虽然也能背诵毛主席语录，但是他们一做就错，就是因为他们的根本立场不对。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派刻骨地仇恨毛主席、仇视毛泽东思想，他们用“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”等棍子恶毒地反对学习毛主席著作，也是他们的阶级本能的反映。两种立场，两种态度，这是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的一个最根本的分歧。我们必须在无产阶级文化大革命中彻底清算党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的罪行。
    空军领导机关的革命群众一致地说，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，是活学活用毛主席著作的最光辉的榜样。我们每一个无产阶级革命战士，一定要学习林彪副主席的光辉榜样，坚决贯彻林彪副主席的指示，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫，彻底粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派恶毒反对学习毛主席著作的阴谋，决心学出新水平，用出新水平，为争取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而努力奋斗。天大地大，跟着毛主席干革命的决心更大！山移海移，忠于毛主席的红心永远不移！　（新华社九日讯）
