Indian Embassy Personnel in Beijing Engage in Illegal Espionage Activities
The Chinese Government Lodges Strongest Protest with the Indian Government

The Chinese Foreign Ministry, in a note, solemnly notified the Indian Embassy that, effective immediately, the Chinese government no longer recognizes Lu Guan Nan's diplomatic status, and before the Chinese judicial authorities impose legal sanctions on his crimes, Lu Guan Nan is not allowed to leave China.

New China News Agency, June 12th: A responsible official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned the Indian Charge d'Affaires to the Embassy, Sathe, this afternoon and handed him a note. Regarding the illegal espionage activities of Indian Embassy personnel in Beijing, the Chinese government lodged the strongest protest with the Indian government. The note solemnly notified the Indian Embassy in China that, effective immediately, the Chinese government no longer recognizes Lu Guan Nan's diplomatic status, and before the Chinese judicial authorities impose legal sanctions on his crimes, Lu Guan Nan is not allowed to leave China. The full text of the note is as follows:

Indian Embassy in China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sends a note to the Indian Embassy in China and states the following regarding the illegal espionage activities of the Embassy personnel in Beijing:

On the afternoon of June 4, 1967, the Second Secretary of the Indian Embassy, Lu Guan Nan, and the Third Secretary, Wei Jie, drove to a certain location in the western suburbs of Beijing. They blatantly violated well-known Chinese laws by surveilling and photographing a military restricted area. The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers responsible for local security immediately approached them and ordered them to leave. However, Lu Guan Nan and Wei Jie ignored the warnings and continued to linger around the restricted area and secretly photograph it. The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers found their behavior suspicious and detained them, handing them over to the public security authorities for interrogation. The public security personnel ordered them to hand over the film, but Lu and Wei were defiant and lied. Only after being sternly rebuked did they reluctantly hand it over. Upon developing the film on the spot, it was found that the more than ten photographs clearly constituted a complete topographic map of the restricted area and its surrounding areas. In the face of overwhelming evidence, Lu and Wei could not deny the facts and had to admit them, signing the interrogation record.

Investigations revealed that Lu Guan Nan has not been the first time engaging in illegal intelligence activities on Chinese soil. Since the beginning of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Lu Guan Nan has taken advantage of the situation, brazenly violating Chinese laws, and collecting Chinese political and military intelligence everywhere, with particularly serious circumstances. Based on the materials provided by the revolutionary masses in Beijing, Lu Guan Nan has repeatedly infiltrated high-level Party and government agencies in China and even mixed into the reception station of the Central Cultural Revolution Group of the Communist Party of China. To cover up his identity, Lu has shamelessly impersonated personnel from friendly countries such as Pakistan and Nepal stationed in China or students. During his espionage activities, Lu has been caught by the Red Guards several times or driven away by the revolutionary masses. He has also been handed over to the public security authorities and admitted his mistakes. However, Lu Guan Nan not only did not mend his ways but instead became even more brazen, disregarding the interference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and stealing military intelligence. The facts prove that Lu Guan Nan is completely a spy disguised as a diplomat, committing serious crimes against the Chinese people.

The Chinese government is extremely indignant at the blatant espionage activities of Indian Embassy personnel and lodges the strongest protest with the Indian government. The Chinese Foreign Ministry solemnly notifies the Indian Embassy in China that, effective immediately, the Chinese government no longer recognizes Lu Guan Nan's diplomatic status, and before the Chinese judicial authorities impose legal sanctions on his crimes, Lu Guan Nan is not allowed to leave China.

    印度驻华使馆人员在北京非法从事间谍活动
    我政府向印政府提出最强烈抗议
    我外交部在照会中严正通知印度使馆，自即刻起，中国政府不再承认鲁冠南的外交官身份，而且在中国司法机关对其罪行进行法律制裁前，鲁冠南不得离开中国
    新华社十二日讯　中国外交部负责人员今天下午召见印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，向他递交了一份照会。就印度驻华使馆人员在北京非法从事间谍活动一事，向印度政府提出最强烈的抗议。严正通知印度驻华大使馆：自即刻起，中国政府不再承认鲁冠南的外交官身份，而且在中国司法机关对其罪行进行法律制裁以前，鲁冠南不得离开中国。照会全文如下：印度驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部照会印度驻华大使馆，并就大使馆人员在北京非法从事间谍活动一事申述如下：
    一九六七年六月四日下午，印度大使馆二等秘书鲁冠南和三等秘书维杰驾车至北京西郊某地。他们公然破坏众所周知的中国法令，对在该地的军事禁区进行窥测和拍摄照片。负责当地警卫的中国人民解放军战士在发现他们后，曾立即上前劝阻并要他们离去。但是，鲁冠南和维杰根本置之不理，继续在禁区周围逗留和偷摄禁区照片。中国人民解放军战士认为鲁、维二人形迹可疑，遂将他们扣留，交公安部门查问。公安人员命令他们交出胶卷，但鲁、维二人态度恶劣，竭力狡赖，在公安人员的严正驳斥下，才被迫交出。经当场冲洗，发现所摄十余张照片清楚地构成该禁区及其附近区域的完整地形图。在人赃俱全的情况下，鲁、维二人无法抵赖，不得不承认事实，并在查问记录上签字。
    据调查，鲁冠南在中国领土上进行非法的情报活动，这已经不是第一次。自中国无产阶级文化大革命以来，鲁冠南认为有机可乘，肆无忌惮地违犯中国法令，到处搜集中国政治、军事情报，情节十分严重。单凭北京市革命群众检举的材料，鲁冠南就曾多次潜入中国高级党政机关，并混入中共中央文化革命小组接待站。为了掩盖其身份，鲁还不止一次极为无耻地冒充巴基斯坦和尼泊尔等友好国家的驻华使馆人员或留学生。鲁在进行窃取情报活动中，曾多次被红卫兵抓住，或被革命群众赶走。并且还被扭送过公安部门，承认错误。但是，鲁冠南不仅不有所收敛，反而变本加厉，竟然不顾中国人民解放军战士的干预，窃取有关军事禁区的情报。事实证明，鲁冠南完完全全是一个披着外交官外衣的间谍分子，对中国人民犯下了严重罪行。
    中国政府对于印度驻华使馆人员这种明目张胆的间谍活动，极为愤慨，并向印度政府提出最强烈的抗议。中国外交部严正通知印度驻华大使馆，自即刻起，中国政府不再承认鲁冠南的外交官身份，而且在中国司法机关对其罪行进行法律制裁以前，鲁冠南不得离开中国。中华人民共和国外交部
    一九六七年六月十二日  于北京
