The running dogs of U.S. imperialism, Israel, under the cover of the United Nations' "ceasefire resolution," continue to launch savage attacks on Arab countries. This further exposes the vicious face of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, colludes with British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique to concoct one "ceasefire resolution" after another in the United Nations, and on the other hand, directs Israel to step up its aggression. With this set of counter-revolutionary two-pronged tactics, it is pushing forward its plan for new colonialist expansion in the Middle East.

The big and small bosses in Washington have already eagerly revealed the cards of U.S. imperialism. Johnson threatened that "if this region is to have a truly stable situation, many fundamental issues must be resolved immediately." The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, even more blatantly shouted that "the implementation of the ceasefire must be linked to a longer-term discussion," and that "all outstanding issues" must be resolved.

What are these "fundamental issues" and "outstanding issues"? The fundamental issue that remains unresolved in the Middle East is for U.S. imperialism to completely withdraw from this region, for all old and new colonialist aggressors to withdraw from this region, and to eliminate the threat posed by Israel, the dagger of imperialism, to Arab countries. At present, the most urgent task is to resolutely stop the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel, and to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Arab countries. Johnson and his ilk deliberately avoid this substantive issue, while at the same time inciting Israel to intensify its military attacks, proposing so-called "fundamental issues" and "outstanding issues." This is clearly an attempt to use Israel's advantageous military position, through the intervention of big powers, to force Arab countries to accept various humiliating conditions. The true intentions of U.S. imperialism are indeed too vicious.

The wolfish ambitions of U.S. imperialism can be seen from the so-called "six-point plan" proposed by the Canadian Prime Minister. This plan, concocted according to Johnson's intentions, imposes a series of unreasonable demands on Arab countries. It not only seeks to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United Arab Republic over the Gulf of Aqaba, to guarantee Israel's unimpeded passage through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal, and to deprive the Palestinian people of their legitimate right to return to their homeland, but also demands that Arab countries accept the deployment of "United Nations forces." It is obvious that U.S. imperialism intends to use this to consolidate and expand Israel's position of aggression, strengthen its control over the Middle East, and realize Eisenhower's "Eisenhower Doctrine" which he failed to achieve in 1958.

Hunting dogs are the ones who understand their master's intentions best. After returning from the United Nations, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban boasted that "Israel will not casually squander its opportunities" and that "Israel will advance towards greater and deeper security." Is it not clear that the criminal plots of U.S. imperialism are exposed?

Now, it is clear to everyone that from Israel's opening of fire, to the United Nations' call for a "ceasefire," from the so-called "mediation" by a few big powers, to Israel's expansion of aggression, all are part of a grand conspiracy meticulously planned by the U.S. and British imperialists in collusion with the Soviet revisionist clique. This is a plan of action by U.S. imperialism to further push its new colonialism in the Middle East. U.S. imperialism is scheming to carve up Arab countries, enslave the Arab people, and return imperialist forces to the Suez Canal and the Arab world. U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Arab people, and the contradiction between it and the Arab people is irreconcilable. The struggle between the Arab people and U.S. imperialism and its accomplices is a life-and-death struggle. The Arab people must fight this anti-aggression struggle to the end.

Chairman Mao said: "A characteristic of our times is the surging tide of national independence movements in Asia and Africa. The colonialists are trying every means to reverse this trend. However, ... all the plots and provocations of the colonialists will certainly meet with the most miserable failure."

U.S. imperialism's attempt to place Arab countries under its colonial rule is sheer fantasy. Through this recent struggle, the peoples of the Arab countries have further seen through the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. They understand more clearly that they must not believe U.S. imperialism's "sweet talk," nor be afraid of its threats, and must engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with it. Although the Arab people are facing a vicious enemy and the struggle is arduous, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "In times of difficulty, we must see achievements, see the light, and raise our spirits." We are confident that the Arab people, drawing lessons from this anti-aggression struggle, raising their awareness, strengthening their unity, and persevering in a long-term struggle, will certainly be able to thoroughly smash the new colonialist plan of U.S. imperialism and achieve the final victory in the anti-aggression struggle.

    坚决粉碎美帝的新殖民主义
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义的走狗以色列，在联合国的“停火决议”掩护下，继续向阿拉伯国家发动猖狂进攻。这就更进一步暴露了美帝国主义的凶恶面目。美帝国主义一方面伙同英帝国主义和苏修集团在联合国搞出一个又一个所谓“停火决议”，一方面指使以色列一步又一步扩大侵略，用这样一套反革命的两手策略，来推行它在中东地区的新殖民主义扩张计划。
    华盛顿的大小头目已经迫不及待地把美帝国主义的底牌亮出来了。约翰逊以威胁的口吻扬言“如果这个地区要有真正稳定的局面，必须立即解决许多基本问题”。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡则更露骨地叫嚷，要“把实现停火同进行更长期的讨论联系起来”，要解决“一切悬而未决的问题”。
    什么“基本问题”、“悬而未决的问题”？中东地区的悬而未决的基本问题，就是美帝国主义彻底从这个地区滚出去，就是一切新老殖民主义的侵略势力从这个地区滚出去，就是消除以色列这一把帝国主义的尖刀对阿拉伯国家的威胁。在当前来说，最迫切的就是坚决制止美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略行动，保证阿拉伯国家的主权和领土完整。约翰逊之流故意回避这个实质问题，而却在怂恿以色列加紧军事进攻的同时，提出所谓“基本问题”和“悬而未决的问题”，这分明是要利用以色列在军事上取得的有利地位，通过大国干涉，迫使阿拉伯国家接受各种屈辱条件。图穷匕现，美帝国主义的手段实在太狠毒了。
    美帝国主义的狼子野心，从加拿大总理提出的所谓“六点计划”中就可见端倪。这一个按照约翰逊的意图炮制的方案，向阿拉伯国家提出了一大堆无理要求。它不仅要侵犯阿联对亚喀巴湾的主权，保证以色列在亚喀巴湾和苏伊士运河通行无阻，剥夺巴勒斯坦人民重返家园的合法权利，而且要阿拉伯国家接受“联合国部队”进驻。很显然，美帝国主义就是要借此巩固和扩大以色列的侵略地位，加强它对中东地区的控制，实现艾森豪威尔在一九五八年所未能实现的“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    猎犬是最懂得主子的意图的。以色列外长埃班从联合国回去以后，就气焰万丈地叫嚣什么“以色列决不会随便糟塌它的机会”，“以色列将朝着更广和更深的安全前进”。美帝国主义的罪恶图谋不是昭然若揭了吗？
    现在，人们可以看得很清楚，从以色列的开火，到联合国的呼吁“停火”，从几个大国的所谓“调停”，到以色列的扩大侵略，都是美英帝国主义伙同苏修集团精心策划的大阴谋。这是美帝国主义在中东进一步推行新殖民主义的一个行动计划。美帝国主义处心积虑要宰割阿拉伯国家，奴役阿拉伯人民，使帝国主义势力重返苏伊士运河，重返阿拉伯世界。美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民不共戴天的死敌，它和阿拉伯人民之间的矛盾是不可调和的。阿拉伯人民同美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争，是一场你死我活的斗争。阿拉伯人民必须把这场反侵略的斗争进行到底。
    毛主席说：“我们这个时代的一个特点是亚非各国民族独立运动的高涨。殖民主义者想尽一切办法企图扭转这个形势。但是，……殖民主义者的一切阴谋和挑衅一定会遭到最惨重的失败。”
    美帝国主义企图把阿拉伯国家置于它的殖民统治之下，这完全是痴心妄想。阿拉伯各国人民通过最近的这场斗争，进一步看清了美帝国主义的侵略本质，他们更加懂得，决不能相信美帝国主义的“好话”，也不能害怕美帝国主义的恐吓，必须同它进行针锋相对的斗争。虽然阿拉伯人民面对着凶恶的敌人，斗争是艰巨的，但是正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我们坚信，阿拉伯人民从这场反侵略斗争中吸取教训，提高觉悟，加强团结，坚持长期斗争，就一定能够彻底粉碎美帝国主义的新殖民主义计划，取得反侵略斗争的最后胜利。
