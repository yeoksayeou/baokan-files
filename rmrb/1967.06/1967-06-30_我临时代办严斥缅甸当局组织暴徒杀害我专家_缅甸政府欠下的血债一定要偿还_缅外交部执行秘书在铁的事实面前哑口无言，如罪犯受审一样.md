	New York Times, June 29th - Comrade Xiao Ming, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Myanmar, strongly condemned the Myanmar government for organizing thugs to kill Chinese experts. He declared that the blood debt owed by the Myanmar government must be repaid.

	The Myanmar Foreign Ministry's Executive Secretary, U Ohn Kyin, was forced to visit the Chinese Embassy in Yangon to inspect the body of the Chinese expert Liu Yi, who was brutally murdered by thugs on the same day. Faced with the ironclad facts, U Ohn Kyin had nothing to say and was rebuked like a criminal by the Chinese embassy staff.

	On June 28th in the afternoon, while Comrade Xiao Ming was lodging the strongest and most urgent protest with the Myanmar Foreign Ministry over the murder of a Chinese woman by over 300 Myanmar thugs and the savage attack on the Chinese Teachers' Association, the Myanmar government once again organized thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy, killing the Chinese expert Liu Yi on the spot. Upon receiving the news, Xiao Ming immediately lodged a protest with the Myanmar government and demanded to see U Ohn Kyin to inspect the scene. However, while Xiao Ming was denouncing and exposing the fascist atrocities of the Myanmar authorities in the courtyard of the Myanmar Foreign Ministry, more than ten thugs gathered at the gate of the Foreign Ministry, shouting wildly and throwing stones at Xiao Ming and others. Xiao Ming lodged the strongest and most urgent protest against the Myanmar authorities for this.

	At 4:30 PM, after Xiao Ming's persistent struggle, U Ohn Kyin was forced to lead two diplomats, two policemen, a forensic doctor, and a photographer to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.

	Xiao Ming, pointing to the body of Liu Yi, who had been stabbed twice in the head and ear and fatally wounded in the waist, asked U Ohn Kyin sternly: The Myanmar government has repeatedly claimed to protect the safety of the Chinese Embassy and maintain Sino-Myanmar friendship. Is this how you "protect" and "maintain friendship"? Xiao Ming pointed out that blood debts must be repaid! This fascist atrocity is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government and people. At this time, the Chinese comrades present continuously shouted: "Oppose the fascist atrocities of the Myanmar government! The great Chinese people are not to be insulted! All anti-China elements will meet a bad end! The Myanmar government must stop the fascist atrocities!"

	Some comrades also questioned U Ohn Kyin on the spot: "Liu Yi, the Chinese expert, came to help Myanmar build its country, but you instigated thugs to kill him. You are too cruel!" Comrade Cao Dalin, who was injured in four places, came out to denounce the fascist atrocities of the Myanmar government and lodged the strongest protest against the Myanmar government.

	The murderer, Jin Mao, who stabbed Comrade Cao Dalin, was captured on the spot by the Chinese embassy staff. This thug admitted in front of U Ohn Kyin that he was sent by someone with ulterior motives to climb over the wall into the Chinese Embassy compound and stab the Chinese messenger with a knife. The Chinese Embassy demanded that the Myanmar side sign the confession of Jin Mao and then handed over the murderer and the murder weapon to the Myanmar side. At this time, the Chinese embassy staff repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Severely punish the murderer!"

	U Ohn Kyin and others were forced to admit the facts and promised to take measures to prevent such incidents from happening again.

	Finally, Comrade Xiao Ming demanded that the Myanmar government severely punish the murderer, compensate the families of the victims, publicly apologize to the Chinese government and people, guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy and its personnel, and immediately stop the fascist atrocities against the Chinese people.

    我临时代办严斥缅甸当局组织暴徒杀害我专家
    缅甸政府欠下的血债一定要偿还
    缅外交部执行秘书在铁的事实面前哑口无言，如罪犯受审一样
    新华社二十九日讯　仰光消息：缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦二十八日下午四时半被迫前往中国驻缅甸大使馆，察验当天被暴徒野蛮残杀的中国专家刘逸的遗体。吴翁钦在铁的事实面前无话可讲，象罪犯一样受到中国使馆人员的严厉谴责。
    二十八日下午，正当中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明在缅甸外交部就二十七日三百多名缅甸暴徒杀害我华侨女同胞，疯狂袭击华侨教师联合会向缅甸政府提出最最强烈、最最紧急的抗议时，缅甸政府再次组织暴徒袭击我大使馆，当场杀害中国专家刘逸。肖明接到电话后，当即向缅甸政府提出抗议，并坚决要求见吴翁钦，要他到使馆现场察验。但是，正当肖明在缅甸外交部院内控诉和揭露缅甸当局的法西斯暴行时，十多名暴徒来到外交部门前狂叫，并野蛮地向肖明等投掷石块。肖明为此向缅甸当局提出最最强烈、最最紧急的抗议。
    下午四时半，经过肖明的坚决斗争，吴翁钦被迫带领两名外交官员、两名警察、一名法医和一名摄影人员来到中国驻缅甸大使馆。
    肖明指着头部和耳部受两刀刺伤，腰部受致命伤，壮烈牺牲的中国专家刘逸的尸体，向吴翁钦严正质问：缅甸政府一再声称要保护中国使馆的安全，要保持中缅友好，难道你们就是要用杀人放火、暴徒袭击来“保护”？难道你们就是要用这种法西斯暴行来“保持友好”？肖明指出，血债一定要偿还！这一法西斯暴行，中国政府、中国人民绝不能容忍。这时，在场的中国同志们不断高呼：“反对缅甸政府的法西斯暴行！”“伟大的中国人民是不可侮的！”“所有反华的人都没有好下场！”“缅甸政府必须制止法西斯暴行！”有的同志还当场质问吴翁钦：“中国专家刘逸是来帮助缅甸建设的，你们却指使暴徒残杀了他，你们太残忍！”身受四处刺伤的信使曹达林同志当场出来控诉缅甸政府的法西斯暴行，并向缅甸政府提出最最强烈的抗议。
    刺伤信使曹达林同志的凶手金貌当场被我使馆人员捕获。这个暴徒在吴翁钦面前承认，他受别有用心的人的差遣，翻墙进入中国大使馆院内用刀刺伤我信使。中国使馆要缅方在金貌供词上签字后，当场把凶手、凶器交给缅方。这时，中国使馆的同志们一再高呼：“严办凶手！”等口号。
    吴翁钦等被迫承认事实，并保证采取措施，不再发生这类事件。
    临时代办肖明最后要求缅甸政府严惩凶手，抚恤受难家属，向中国政府和人民公开道歉，保证中国使馆和人员的安全，立即停止对华侨的法西斯暴行。
