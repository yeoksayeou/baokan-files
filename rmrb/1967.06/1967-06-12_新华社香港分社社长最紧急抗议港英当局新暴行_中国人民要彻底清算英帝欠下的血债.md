The Chief of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Liang Weilin, has made an urgent and strong protest against the recent brutal and fascist acts of suppression carried out by the British authorities in Hong Kong against patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The British authorities have also insanely insulted our great leader Chairman Mao, in a grave political provocation. On the night of the 10th, Liang Weilin sent the most serious, strongest, and most urgent protest to the British "Governor" David Trench.

The protest stated: "In recent days, the British authorities in Hong Kong have dispatched large numbers of police and 'riot squads' to carry out brutal and fascist suppression against patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They have attempted to ban the posting of slogans, big-character posters, and pictures that propagate Mao Zedong Thought and expose the fascist atrocities of the British authorities. They have also attempted to suppress the struggle of our patriotic compatriots against suppression. On June 8, the British 'riot squad' launched a savage attack on workers at the Kowloon branch of the Public Works Department's Electrical Engineering Division and the Gas Company in the To Kwa Wan district. Dozens were severely beaten, over five hundred were arrested, and dozens are still being illegally detained, including Xu Tianbo from the Electrical Engineering Division who was beaten to death by the British police. On the night of June 9, British police and special agents launched a planned and premeditated attack on the Silver Theatre in Kwun Tong, beating up the staff and illegally arresting more than twenty staff members, including the manager, and seizing property. What is even more serious is that the British police and special agents dared to smash a statue of Chairman Mao and tear down big-character posters and pictures that propagate Mao Zedong Thought. This is a grave insult to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and a grave political provocation. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Chinese people cannot tolerate such brutal acts and insane provocations by the British authorities. I once again strongly protest in the most serious, strongest, and most urgent terms."

Liang Weilin pointed out in the protest: "The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the Chinese people, fully understand how to deal with you fascist bandits. Your reckless behavior in Hong Kong will not save you from your impending doom. The blood debt that British imperialism owes to the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon must be repaid in full; the aggression that British imperialism has committed against China for over a hundred years, especially the occupation of Hong Kong, the annexation of Kowloon, and the seizure of the New Territories, must be thoroughly settled. If you do not repent and insist on being enemies of the Chinese people, you will have no other fate than to be smashed to pieces by the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Chinese people."

    新华社香港分社社长最紧急抗议港英当局新暴行
    中国人民要彻底清算英帝欠下的血债
    新华社香港十一日电　新华社香港分社社长梁威林就香港英国当局连日来对我港九爱国同胞施行强盗式的极端残暴的法西斯迫害，并极其疯狂地侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席的极端严重的政治挑衅事件，十日深夜向港英“总督”戴麟趾提出最严重、最强烈、最紧急的抗议。
    抗议说：“连日来，港英当局出动大批警察和‘防暴队’，对我港九爱国同胞施行强盗式的极端残暴的法西斯迫害，妄图禁止我爱国同胞张贴宣传毛泽东思想、揭露港英法西斯暴行的标语、大字报和图片，妄图镇压我爱国同胞的反迫害斗争。六月八日，港英‘防暴队’在土瓜湾区向工务局电机部九龙分厂和煤气公司的工人进行野蛮的袭击，当场被毒打受伤的有数十人，逮捕五百多人，至今仍被无理监禁的有数十人，其中电机部工人徐田波竟被港英警察活活打死。六月九日深夜，港英警察和特务又对官塘银都戏院进行有计划有预谋的袭击，毒打戏院职工，无理逮捕该院经理和职工二十多人，抢走物件。尤其严重的是，港英警察和特务竟敢把毛主席塑像打碎，并且撕毁宣传毛泽东思想的大字报和图片。这是对中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的严重侮辱，这是极端严重的政治挑衅。我港九爱国同胞和中国人民对港英当局这种残暴的行径和疯狂的挑衅，是绝对不能容忍的。我向你再一次提出最严重、最强烈、最紧急的抗议。”
    梁威林在抗议中指出：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九爱国同胞和中国人民，是完全懂得怎样收拾你们这些法西斯强盗的。你们在香港的胡作非为，绝对不能挽救你们即将灭亡的命运。英帝国主义对港九同胞所欠下的血债，一定要逐笔偿还；英帝国主义一百多年来对中国的侵略，特别是霸占香港、侵吞九龙、攫取新界的滔天罪行，一定要彻底清算。如果你们不低头认罪，坚持与中国人民为敌，除了被港九爱国同胞和中国人民打得粉身碎骨之外，绝不会有别的下场。”
