Boumedienne, Chairman of the Algerian National Revolutionary Council, returned to Algiers in the early hours of June 14 after talks in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

Boumedienne left for Moscow on June 12. He held eight hours of talks with Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, Podgorny, and others on the same day and the morning of June 13. According to a report by TASS, the talks ended in a "friendly and comradely atmosphere."

Boumedienne passed through Belgrade twice on his way to Moscow and back to Algiers, and held talks with Tito on both occasions. According to a joint communiqué issued after the talks, the two sides had "similar and consistent" views on the situation in the Middle East.
