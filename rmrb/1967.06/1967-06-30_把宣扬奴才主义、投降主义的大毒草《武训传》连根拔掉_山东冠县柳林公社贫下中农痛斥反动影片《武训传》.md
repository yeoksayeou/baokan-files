	Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper publishes the minutes of a discussion by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Liu Lin Commune, Guan County, Shandong, criticizing the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun." In 1951, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, a criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun," which advocates serfdom and capitulation, was launched. In 1954, Chairman Mao solemnly pointed out: "Although 'The Life of Wu Xun' has been criticized, no lessons have been drawn from it to this day."

	Today, in the midst of the great struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we must re-examine Chairman Mao's teachings from more than ten years ago and re-criticize the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun." What lessons should we draw from this?

	The sharp and complex class struggle over the past decade tells us that in a socialist society, the focus of class struggle is still on the issue of power. The bourgeoisie aims to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism, always starting by creating public opinion and seizing the ideological front. Art is a very powerful weapon and an important ideological battlefield. Every time class struggle becomes intense and sharp, the bourgeoisie and their representatives always seize this weapon and use this battlefield to launch a ferocious attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat. The emergence of "The Palace Secrets" was like this, and the emergence of "The Life of Wu Xun" was also like this. The intense class struggle on the cultural front has made us realize: we must never underestimate the weapon of art and the battlefield of art. We must firmly grasp the pen and firmly occupy the stage of art. Every inch of ground must be fought for, and every inch of power must be seized. If we do not recognize the problem in this way, we will make a great mistake.

	The sharp and complex class struggle over the past decade, especially through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has made us clearly realize: such extremely reactionary films as "The Life of Wu Xun" could emerge in socialist China, and the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" initiated and led by Chairman Mao encountered so many obstacles. The root cause lies in those "self-proclaimed Marxists" who have infiltrated the Party and those "big shots" who have usurped power within the Party. These agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party have long hidden within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, and using their power to usurp the power of the proletariat. The fortress is most easily breached from within. This small handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road are our main enemies. The contradiction between us, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, and this small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backers, the top power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, is the principal contradiction and an antagonistic contradiction. We must firmly grasp this direction of struggle and never be confused by internal differences or lose sight of the direction of struggle due to minor issues.

	Chairman Mao said: "A discussion should be launched on the film 'The Life of Wu Xun' and other works and articles related to Wu Xun to thoroughly clarify the confused thinking on this issue."

	Sun Zhikang (poor peasant, revolutionary cadre):
	"The Life of Wu Xun" is a reactionary film that fervently praises the landlord class and their running dogs, fervently advocates serfdom and capitulation, fervently advocates bourgeois reformism, and grossly defames the peasant revolutionary struggle. Its essence and nature are the same as "Self-Cultivation," which is to oppose the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must thoroughly criticize it!

	Wu Xun is from Wuzhuang in our Liu Lin Town. We are most familiar with his disgusting behavior as a serf. Under the banner of "begging for education," he feigned madness, swindled, and deceived. He is a despicable swindler, a big hooligan, a big debtor, and a big landlord, a faithful running dog who wholeheartedly serves the reactionary ruling class.

	Historically, reactionary rulers have always maliciously praised Wu Xun and used him for reactionary propaganda. Representatives of the bourgeoisie inside and outside the Party have also shamelessly praised him. In 1950, when New China was founded and the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries were in full swing, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, in accordance with the political needs of the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, released the poisonous weed "The Life of Wu Xun." Their goal was to make the proletariat bow down to the landlord class and bourgeoisie, to achieve a counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism in China.

	Now, by re-criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun," we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly bury serfdom and capitulation, thoroughly overthrow China's Khrushchev, and never forget class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, ensuring that the proletarian state of China remains red forever!

	Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

	Guo Yingfang (female teacher at Liu Lin Primary School, poor peasant):
	The reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" falsely claims that Wu Xun's schooling was for the poor children and that the suffering of the laboring people is because they are illiterate. This is all deceitful nonsense. Wu Xun's first "public school" was in Liu Lin. When I was young, I wanted to go to school. As I climbed the hill to pick wild vegetables and gather firewood, I often peeked into "Wu Xun Primary School" (originally "Chongxian Public School") from outside the wall. Inside, all the students were children of a few big landlords, not a single one from poor families like ours. Poor children like us could only look in from outside the wall. The landlords' children would throw bricks and stones at us, let alone let us go in to study. Besides, can literacy change the status of suffering and oppression? It absolutely cannot. Chairman Mao teaches us: the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Wu Xun's "public schools" in Liu Lin did not change the status of the poor and lower-middle peasants being exploited and oppressed for those years. It was not until 1943, when the Eighth Route Army came to Liu Lin Town and overthrew the landlords who were oppressing the poor and lower-middle peasants, that we were liberated, and the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants had the opportunity to receive education. I only started school after liberation, and I was already thirteen years old that year. These are ironclad facts. Why does the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" insist on distorting and fabricating, using all means to praise Wu Xun? Looking at the situation of class struggle at that time, we can understand. At that time, the country had just been liberated, and class struggle was extremely sharp and complex. The land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries were in full swing, and our Liu Lin Town was no exception. The question was whether to persist in class struggle and carry the revolution through to the end, or to capitulate and compromise, and half-heartedly give up. This was the big question facing all revolutionary people. At this critical moment, under the protection of the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, the ringleader of the black line in the cultural world, Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, released this reactionary film. As Chairman Mao pointed out, they were trying "to make every effort to preserve the old things and prevent them from dying." They wanted to use the reactionary propaganda of "The Life of Wu Xun" to lead the sharp and complex class struggle to "education saves the country," to protect the remnants of capitalism and feudalism in cities and countryside, and to achieve their evil goal of opposing the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, dreaming of restoring capitalism. It was our great leader Chairman Mao who timely sounded the alarm for us, smashing the evil plot of the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to drag history backward. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the principle of serving proletarian politics with education and combining education with productive labor, thoroughly criticize the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun," thoroughly criticize the reactionary fallacy of "education saves the country," and expose the backstage of the cultural black line—the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road!

	Chen Zhanying (Red Guard of Guan County No. 2 Middle School, from a poor peasant family):
	Chairman Mao said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." The film "The Life of Wu Xun" blatantly advocates that reading can prevent the poor from being deceived and that reading can make the poor have a good life. The film distorts facts, reverses black and white, and vilifies the peasant uprisings to the utmost. Look, the film portrays the peasant uprising army as brutal and savage, killing and burning everywhere, like a band of bandits and robbers, severely alienating the masses, and completely losing popular support, ultimately suffering a complete failure. But Wu Xun's schooling was successful. This is a very vicious attack on the peasant revolution, advocating capitulationism and reformism.

	The film "The Life of Wu Xun" fiercely opposes armed revolution and advocates reformism, fully meeting the needs of the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, aiming to prevent us from revolting, to make us lay down our guns, and give up power, so that he can restore capitalism. We are the loyal little red guards of Chairman Mao. We believe in Chairman Mao's truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The red political power of China was won by the gun, and we must use the gun to defend it. The top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road wants us to lay down our weapons, not to revolt, and not to seize power. His intentions are extremely sinister. We will never listen to his nonsense. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, and keep the iron-clad state of the proletariat forever red.

	Zhao Tongshen (poor peasant, militiaman) and Wang Shangzeng (militia company commander of Liu Lin Commune, Wuzhuang Brigade):
	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The gun is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. In the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, we militiamen followed the words of Chairman Mao, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army, using the gun to drive out imperialism and annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's eight hundred thousand troops, overthrowing the three big mountains that had been oppressing the poor. Today, we militiamen hold our guns tightly, protecting the good days of the poor and lower-middle peasants, defending the socialist state, and are ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade. We truly achieve "call us and we come, come and we can fight, fight and we can win."

	The film "The Life of Wu Xun" deliberately erases the class struggle of the peasant class against the landlords, peddling the philosophy of serfdom, capitulation, and betrayal, trying to make us throw away our guns. Look, Wu Xun is such a coward, with no backbone at all, shaking with fear at the sight of landlords. Yet the film falsely claims he is the "son of the laboring people." This is truly breathing the same air as the landlords! We poor and lower-middle peasants have never been such cowards! The film also writes about Wu Xun and Zhou Da's "literary and martial arts," that is, the two paths of schooling and armed struggle. Later, the martial path "failed," and the literary path "succeeded." Isn't this blatantly telling us not to fight the landlords and not to seize the gun? Isn't this trying to make us all learn from Wu Xun and become the slaves and running dogs of the landlords?

	What is even more infuriating is that the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the film "The Life of Wu Xun" are singing the same tune. He also tries every means to prevent us from seizing the gun, falsely claiming that the poor will not be exploited if they do not eat, and falsely claiming that there is no class struggle now. Isn't this trying to lull us into not resisting and not seizing the gun? He says all this completely to serve his plot to restore capitalism!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." In the past, we relied on the gun to kill enemies and seize power. Today, we still rely on the gun to defend our power. We militiamen will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and will not be fooled by the enemy. The more the enemy hates and fears our guns, the more we must tightly grasp our guns! The top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road wants to rebel, so we must overthrow him! We militiamen will never allow the state won by the revolutionary martyrs with their blood and lives to change color, and we will never allow the poor and lower-middle peasants to suffer again. We must follow Chairman Mao's words, forever hold our guns, and with actual actions, overthrow the "spirit of Wu Xun" and bury serfdom!

	Chairman Mao said: "Communist Party members must question everything, must think it over carefully in their own minds, and consider whether it is in accordance with reality and whether it is reasonable. They must never blindly follow and must never advocate serfdom."

	Yang Shiyuan (poor peasant, 63 years old):
	Chairman Mao said that Wu Xun is a "serf who surrenders to the reactionary feudal rulers," and this is absolutely true! Look at Wu Xun, what kind of person is he! He is completely subservient to the landlords: if the landlord tells him to go east, he dares not go west; if the landlord tells him to beat the dog, he dares not chase the chicken. He sees a landlord and immediately kneels down, with no backbone at all. The landlord class likes such serfs like Wu Xun. The Qing emperor awarded him a yellow horse coat, officials invited him to banquets and drink wine, the governor of Shandong Province under the Kuomintang, Han Fuju, sent him a lot of wood to build a house to commemorate him; the director of the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Education Department personally arranged for his tomb to be built and a stele to be erected. These big and small reactionaries, praising Wu Xun in every way, just want the poor and lower-middle peasants to learn from Wu Xun's example, wholeheartedly become slaves, not struggle, not resist, and be slaves to the landlords generation after generation, suffering exploitation and oppression from the landlords. Their hearts are so poisonous!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must never advocate serfdom." The reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" is a blatant advocate of serfdom and must be uprooted!

	Mu Qirui (poor peasant, former teacher at Liu Lin Primary School):
	In the past, big landlords and big officials all praised Wu Xun, falsely claiming that the West had Jesus, and China had Wu Xun, two great saints who could save the world and save China. This is all deceitful nonsense! Wu Xun's "begging for education" was completely a means of making money. Landlords and officials supported Wu Xun, giving him an official seal of "begging for education," and he used it to swindle everywhere, plundering the people's property. Wu Xun also used the power of the landlords to rent out his school land to farmers and lend money to farmers, carrying out ruthless land rent and usury exploitation on the poor and lower-middle peasants. He himself became a big debtor and a big landlord.

	Wu Xun always said he was "begging for education" for the poor, but in his so-called "public school," the majority of students were the sons of officials and landlords. Even those with two or three hundred mu of land could not go to school, let alone the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. The teaching content was all about Confucius and Mencius, advocating the feudal morality of "three cardinal guides and five constant virtues," advocating serfdom. At that time, the Qing Dynasty was about to collapse, and there were peasant uprisings everywhere. Wu Xun's trick was to make the poor and lower-middle peasants willingly become slaves and not revolt. Wu Xun's education was for the reactionary ruling class, serving the reactionary ruling class. Wu Xun was a big villain who killed people without shedding blood and a wolf in sheep's clothing!

	In the past, Wu Xun received praise from the Qing Dynasty feudal ruling class and the Kuomintang reactionaries; after liberation, he was also fervently praised by the ringleaders of counter-revolutionary revisionism in the cultural world, Zhou Yang and Xia Yan. The enemy praises Wu Xun because Wu Xun's serfdom completely meets their needs. The "tamed tool" theory, betrayal philosophy, and "class struggle extinction" theory advocated by the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road are of the same kind as Wu Xun's serfdom, capitulationism, and reformism, all serving the exploiting class. These counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backstage—the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road—want to use Wu Xun's serfdom to poison the broad masses of people and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We revolutionary people will never let their plot succeed! We must follow Chairman Mao's words, thoroughly criticize "The Life of Wu Xun," overthrow serfdom, and overthrow the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high!

	Yang Guoyu (young female community member of Nan Street Brigade, Liu Lin Commune, from a poor peasant family):
	"The Life of Wu Xun" is a thoroughly reactionary film. It beautifies Wu Xun as the "son of the laboring people" and the "savior of the poor," claiming that Wu Xun "possesses the diligence, bravery, and wisdom of the laboring people." This is all nonsense. I am a native of Liu Lin, and my elders have seen Wu Xun with their own eyes and know what kind of person he is.

	Wu Xun was originally from a poor peasant family. However, he shamefully betrayed our peasant class and became a running dog of the landlord class. He used various despicable means to swindle money. As long as someone gave him money, he could be humiliated by anyone, could lie on the ground and let people ride him like a horse, could drink dirty water, swallow tiles, and eat other people's snot. Relying on these despicable means and the support of the reactionary government and the landlord class, he transformed from a beggar into a big landlord with more than three hundred mu of land. With money, he started lending money. Wu Xun's lending methods were very cunning and ruthless. He said: "The poor can be used, the rich can be guaranteed." Without a rich person as a guarantor, Wu Xun would not lend money. He also had a restriction: those who did not have "three generations" of wealth could not borrow. In this way, if the debtor died, he could still find the next generation to repay the debt. In the past, on the Grand Canal in Linqing, there were two poor lock keepers who built a small house and were tortured to death because they could not repay the high-interest loan from Wu Xun. Wu Xun's tricks of using hooligan methods are infamous in our area. The elderly know that he is a despicable clown who has made many women his so-called "dry mothers."

	Wu Xun has been dead for decades. However, those spokesmen of Wu Xun's serfdom—the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They use Wu Xun's corpse to stir up trouble and poison the people. We poor and lower-middle peasants must settle accounts with this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists!

	Chairman Mao said: "The essence of Marxism is a single sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'"

	Wang Bocheng (Red Guard of Guan County No. 2 Middle School, from a poor peasant family):
	The feudal rulers and the Kuomintang reactionaries fiercely praised Wu Xun, memorialized him, erected stone tablets for him, built tombs for him, and advocated the "spirit of Wu Xun" to deceive the people and maintain their rule.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The essence of Marxism is a single sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Red Guards responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, raised the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and revolted. We smashed the Four Olds, destroyed the stone tablets praising Wu Xun, leveled his tomb, held a meeting of several thousand people, angrily denounced Wu Xun's crimes, thoroughly criticized the "spirit of Wu Xun," and eliminated the poison of Wu Xun.

	Just as we Red Guards were rising up to overthrow Wu Xun and put forward the battle slogan of "smashing Wu Xun's tomb and overthrowing the 'spirit of Wu Xun,'" the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were terrified and tried every means to suppress us, not allowing us to revolt, falsely claiming that "Wu Xun's tomb is a famous historical site" and is a "cultural relic to be protected," and so on. However, we did not listen to that nonsense. We must revolt against Wu Xun, and we must revolt against this big landlord, big hooligan, and big swindler! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt to the end, and victory is ours! We finally broke through the obstacles and revolted against Wu Xun, achieving revolutionary victory. Our revolutionary actions were very good and received the support and praise of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao proposed criticizing the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" in 1951. However, the small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road as their backstage, tried every means to resist and sabotage Chairman Mao's great instructions. In Liu Lin, Wu Xun's stinking tomb has been preserved intact for more than a decade, emitting reactionary stench! Today, we must not only smash a "Wu Xun's tomb" but also thoroughly smash the serfdom of Wu Xun! Let the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his ancestor Wu Xun go to hell!

	Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely."

	Chang Baoping (young female community member of Xi Street Brigade, Liu Lin Commune, from a poor peasant family):
	After watching the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun," I was so angry that I was about to explode. This film has two black hands: one hand smears Wu Xun's face with makeup, making him look like a god from the clouds and mist, who even after death did not forget the poor; the other hand smears the faces of the laboring people with dirt, trying every means to vilify the peasant revolutionary movement, making the laboring people give up armed struggle and walk the path of Wu Xun, becoming slaves generation after generation.

	The film praises Wu Xun as a man with a head full of sores and feet full of pus. The "path of Wu Xun" praised by the film is a path of surrendering to the reactionary feudal rulers. Wu Xun is a serf and at the same time a big landlord who exploits peasants, a parasite who lends money at high interest. He hates the peasants who rise up to overthrow the rule of the landlord class with deep hatred. Under the banner of "public school," he undermines the fighting spirit of the revolutionary masses. The film praises the "path of Wu Xun" as the path to save the country and the people, deceiving people not to engage in armed struggle, not to seize power, but only to read books to have a good life and not be bullied. This is a very vicious scheme to maintain reactionary rule!

	The film also deliberately vilifies the laboring people and vilifies the peasant revolutionary movement. It arranges Zhou Da, who leads horses and carriages for the landlords, as the leader of the peasant revolution, and then smears his face with dirt, portraying the peasant revolutionary army led by Zhou Da as knowing only how to kill and burn, fleeing east and west like bandits, vilifying armed struggle as unpopular. It also vilifies armed struggle as unable to solve the problem of the poor being bullied, advocating that peasants want to have a good life, they must walk the "path of Wu Xun." The film wants everyone to take Wu Xun as an example, not to revolt, kneel on the ground and beg for mercy from the landlord ruling class; not to engage in armed struggle, wholeheartedly "accumulate virtue"; not to seize power, bury one's head in books.

	This villain Wu Xun used special despicable means to help the reactionary ruling class, and therefore received awards from the reactionary leaders. This is also the root reason why the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang and Xia Yan and their backstage praise Wu Xun.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is an error, it must be criticized; if there is a poisonous weed, it must be fought against." We must uproot the big poisonous weed of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," overthrow the "spirit of Wu Xun," and eliminate all the reactionary poison of "The Life of Wu Xun"!

### 把宣扬奴才主义、投降主义的大毒草《武训传》连根拔掉——山东冠县柳林公社贫下中农痛斥反动影片《武训传》

    把宣扬奴才主义、投降主义的大毒草《武训传》连根拔掉
    ——山东冠县柳林公社贫下中农痛斥反动影片《武训传》
    编者按：今天，本报发表了武训的家乡——山东冠县柳林公社贫下中农批判反动影片《武训传》的座谈纪要。
    一九五一年，在毛主席的亲自发动和领导下，对宣扬奴才主义、投降主义的反动影片《武训传》展开了批判。一九五四年，毛主席严正地指出：“《武训传》虽然批判了，却至今没有引出教训”。
    今天，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，重温毛主席十多年前的教导，重新批判反动影片《武训传》，我们要引出什么教训呢？
    十多年来尖锐复杂的阶级斗争告诉我们，在社会主义社会里，阶级斗争的焦点，仍然集中在政权问题上。资产阶级要颠覆无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义，总要先造舆论，总要先抓意识形态方面的工作。文艺是个非常厉害的武器，是个非常重要的舆论阵地。每当阶级斗争激烈尖锐的时候，资产阶级及其代表人物总是竭力抓住这个武器，利用这个阵地，向无产阶级专政发动猖狂的进攻。《清宫秘史》的出笼是这样，《武训传》的出笼也是这样。文艺战线上惊心动魄的阶级斗争使我们懂得：决不能小看文艺这个武器，决不能轻视文艺这个阵地。我们一定要牢牢掌握笔杆子，牢牢占领文艺舞台。寸土必争，寸权必夺。如果我们现在不是这样地认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。
    十多年来尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，特别是通过这次无产阶级文化大革命，我们清楚地认识到：《武训传》这样极端反动的影片能够在社会主义的中国出笼，毛主席亲自发动和领导的对《武训传》的批判所以受到重重阻拦，其根子在于那些“号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员”，混进党内的那些自封的“大人物”。这些资产阶级在党内的代理人，长期隐藏在无产阶级专政机构的内部，打着“红旗”反红旗，利用职权专了无产阶级的政。堡垒最容易从内部攻破，这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是我们最主要的敌人。我们广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子，同这一小撮反革命修正主义分子及背后支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。我们一定要紧紧掌握这个斗争大方向，千万不要被一些内部的分歧扰乱了阵脚，千万不要因为一些枝节性的问题而迷失了斗争的大方向。
    毛主席说：“应当展开关于电影《武训传》及其他有关武训的著作和论文的讨论，求得彻底地澄清在这个问题上的混乱思想。”
    孙仲康（贫农，革命干部）：
    《武训传》是一部狂热地歌颂地主阶级及其走狗，狂热地宣扬奴才主义、投降主义，狂热地宣扬资产阶级改良主义，大肆诬蔑农民革命斗争的反革命影片。它的要害和实质同《修养》一样，就是反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。我们必须对它进行彻底的批判！
    武训是俺们柳林镇武庄人，他那套令人作呕的奴才言行，俺们最摸底。他打着“行乞兴学”的旗号，装疯卖傻，招摇撞骗。他是一个卑鄙无耻的大骗子、大流氓、大债主和大地主，是一个死心塌地为反动统治阶级效劳的忠实走狗。
    历来的反动统治者都别有用心地歌颂武训，利用他进行反动宣传。党内外资产阶级代表人物也对他进行无耻的吹捧。一九五○年，正当新中国成立，土地改革和镇压反革命运动轰轰烈烈地展开的时候，反革命修正主义分子周扬、夏衍一伙，根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的政治需要，抛出了大毒草《武训传》。他们的目的是要无产阶级象武训那样向地主阶级和资产阶级屈膝投降，在中国实现资产阶级的反革命复辟。
    现在，我们开展对《武训传》的再批判，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底埋葬奴才主义、投降主义，彻底打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，保证我国无产阶级江山千秋万代永不变色！
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    郭迎芳（柳林完小女教师，贫农）：
    反动电影《武训传》胡吹武训办学是为了穷孩子，胡说劳动人民吃苦遭罪都是因为不识字，这全是骗人的鬼话。武训办的第一个“义学”就在柳林。俺小时候很想上学，上坡挖野菜拾柴禾从“义学”旁边走过时，常趴在围子墙上往“武训小学”（原“崇贤义塾”）里瞧，里边念书的全是几户大地主家的孩子，根本没俺穷人家的孩子。穷人家孩子隔着墙往里看，地主的孩子就扔砖头土块打，别说进去上学了。再说，识了字能改变受苦遭罪的地位吗？根本不能。毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。武训在柳林办了那些年“义学”，柳林贫下中农受剥削受压迫的地位丝毫没有改变。直到一九四三年，八路军来到柳林镇，把骑在贫下中农头上的地主老财斗倒了，俺们才得到了解放，贫下中农的子女也才有了受教育的机会。俺就是解放后才上的学，那年俺已经十三岁了。这些都是铁的事实，为什么反动电影《武训传》偏偏要颠倒黑白，歪曲捏造，不择手段地吹捧武训呢？看看当时阶级斗争的形势就能明白。当时，全国刚刚解放，阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂，轰轰烈烈的土地改革、镇压反革命运动正在进行，俺们柳林镇也和全国一样。是坚持搞阶级斗争，把革命进行到底，还是投降妥协，半途而废？这是摆在所有革命人民面前的大问题。就在这样一个关键时刻，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的庇护之下，文艺界的黑线总头目周扬、夏衍抛出了这部反动电影。正如毛主席一针见血地指出的，他们是想“以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡”。他们妄想通过《武训传》的反动宣传，把尖锐复杂的阶级斗争引导到“教育救国”上去，以便保护城乡资本主义和封建主义残余，达到他们反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，梦想复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。是我们伟大领袖毛主席及时给我们敲起了警钟，粉碎了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图拉着历史倒退的罪恶阴谋。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的原则，彻底批判反动电影《武训传》，彻底批判“教育救国”的反动谬论，并且要将文艺黑线的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭！
    陈占英（冠县二中红卫兵，贫农出身）：
    毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”电影《武训传》却明目张胆地宣扬读书能使穷人不受骗，读书能使穷人有好日子过。电影歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，对农民起义极尽丑化污蔑之能事。你看，电影把农民起义军写成蛮横残暴，到处杀人放火，象一群土匪强盗，严重地脱离群众，一点也不得人心，最后遭到了彻底的失败。但是武训办学胜利了。这是十分恶毒地攻击农民革命，鼓吹投降主义、改良主义。
    电影《武训传》猖狂地反对武装革命，提倡改良主义，是完全适合党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派需要的，目的是不让我们革命，叫我们放下枪杆子，放弃政权，以便他复辟资本主义。我们是毛主席忠实的红小兵，我们就是相信毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，中国的红色政权就是枪杆子打出来的，还要用枪杆子来保卫。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派让我们放下武器，不要革命，不要政权，其用心十分恶毒。我们坚决不听他那一套鬼话。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远跟毛主席闹革命，让无产阶级的铁打江山永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    赵同申（贫农社员，民兵）、王尚增（柳林公社武庄大队民兵连长）：
    毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权。”枪杆子是俺贫下中农的命根子，俺民兵在抗日战争和解放战争中，听毛主席他老人家的话，配合人民子弟兵，用枪杆子赶跑了帝国主义，消灭了蒋介石的八百万军队，推翻了压在穷人头上的三座大山。今天，俺民兵紧握枪杆子，保护贫下中农的好日子，保卫社会主义的江山，随时准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人，真正做到“召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜。”
    电影《武训传》却极力抹煞农民阶级对地主老财的阶级斗争，贩卖奴才哲学、投降哲学、叛徒哲学，妄想让我们扔掉手中的枪杆子。你看，就武豆沫（武训）那个熊样，浑身没一点骨头，一见地主老财就吓得打哆嗦，可电影却胡说他是“劳动人民的儿子”，这真是和地主老财一个鼻孔出气！俺贫下中农啥时候也没当过那样的孬种！电影里还写了武训和周大的“一文一武”，即上学识字和武装斗争两条道路。后来武的“败”了，文的“胜”了，这不是明目张胆地不叫我们跟地主斗，不叫我们抓枪杆子吗？这不是想叫我们都去学武豆沫，当地主的奴才和走狗吗？
    气人的是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和电影《武训传》唱一个调子。他也千方百计地不让我们抓枪杆子，胡说什么穷人不受剥削就没饭吃，还胡说现在没有阶级斗争了，这不是想麻痹我们，叫我们不要反抗，不要抓枪杆子吗？他这样说，完全是为他搞资本主义复辟服务的！
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”过去我们靠枪杆子杀敌人，打江山，今天我们还得靠枪杆子守江山。俺民兵坚决按毛主席的话办事，决不上坏人的当，受敌人的骗。敌人越是仇视、害怕我们手中的枪杆子，我们越是要紧握枪杆子！党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派想翻天，我们就要打倒他！我们民兵决不允许革命先烈用鲜血和生命换来的江山变颜色，决不能眼看着贫下中农再受二茬罪。我们一定听毛主席的话，永远紧握手中枪，用实际行动打倒“武训精神”，埋葬奴隶主义！
    毛主席说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”
    杨士源（贫农，六十三岁）：
    毛主席说，武训是个“向反动的封建统治者投降”的奴才，这是千真万确！你看，武训是个什么玩意儿！他对地主百依百顺：地主叫他向东，他不敢向西；地主叫他打狗，他不敢?鸡。他看到地主就磕头，就下跪，没一点骨头。地主阶级就喜欢武训这样的奴才。清朝皇帝赏他黄马褂，官老爷请他赴宴喝酒，国民党的山东省主席韩复榘运了很多木材来，准备修房子纪念他；伪山东省教育厅厅长亲自安排为他修坟，为他立碑写传。这些大大小小的反动派，千说武训好，万说武训好，就是想让贫下中农学武训的样子，一心当奴隶，不斗争，不反抗，世世代代给地主当牛作马，受地主的剥削压迫。他们的心有多毒！
    毛主席教导我们说：“绝对不应提倡奴隶主义”。反动影片《武训传》就是露骨地宣扬奴隶主义的大毒草，必须连根铲除！
    穆其瑞（贫农，前柳林小学教师）：
    过去大地主、大官僚都是吹捧武训的，他们胡说什么西方出了个耶稣，中国出了个武训，是两大圣人，能救世界，救中国。这全是骗人的鬼话！武训的“行乞兴学”，完全是一种发财的门路。地主、官府给武训撑腰，发给他官封的“化缘簿”，他就拿着到处招摇撞骗，搜刮民财。武训还借地主的权势把学地出租给农民，把钱放给农民，对贫下中农进行残酷的地租剥削和高利贷剥削。他自己成了大债主、大地主。
    武训口口声声说他为了穷人“行乞兴学”，但是在他开办的所谓“义学”里，念书的绝大多数是官僚地主家的少爷，一般有二、三十亩地的人家也上不了学，更别说是贫下中农家的孩子。教学的内容全是孔、孟那一套，宣扬“三纲五常”的封建道德，宣扬奴隶主义。当时，清朝眼看要灭亡了，到处是农民造反，武训的那一套就是叫贫下中农甘心当奴隶，不要革命。武训兴的是反动统治阶级的学，是为反动统治阶级服务的，武训是一个杀人不见血的大坏蛋和披着羊皮的狼！
    过去，武训得到了清朝封建统治阶级以及国民党反动派的吹捧；解放后，他又受到把持文艺界的反革命修正主义头目周扬、夏衍的狂热吹捧。敌人这样吹捧武训，就因为武训的奴隶主义，完完全全适合他们的需要。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所提倡的“驯服工具”论、叛徒哲学和“阶级斗争熄灭”论，与武训的奴隶主义、投降主义、改良主义是一类货色，都是为剥削阶级服务的。这些反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是想借武训的奴隶主义，毒害广大人民，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。我们革命人民决不能让他们的阴谋得逞！我们一定听毛主席的话，彻底批判《武训传》，打倒奴隶主义，大造党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反，巩固无产阶级专政，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远飘扬！
    杨国玉（柳林公社南街大队青年女社员，贫农）：
    《武训传》是一部彻头彻尾的反革命影片。它把武训美化成“劳动人民的儿子”“穷苦人的救星”，说什么武训“具有劳动人民的勤劳、勇敢和智慧”，这完全是胡说八道。俺是柳林人，俺的老人们亲眼看见过武训，知道武训是个什么货色。
    武训本来出身于贫农家庭。但是，他可耻地背叛了俺们农民阶级，当了地主阶级的走狗。他采用各种各样下流的手段，骗取钱财。只要别人给他钱，他可以任人污辱，可以趴在地上让人当马骑，可以喝脏水，吞瓦块，吃别人的鼻涕。凭着这种下流手段，以及反动政府和地主阶级的支持，他由一个叫化子变成了有三百多亩地的大地主。有了钱财，他就放债。武训放债的手段是很阴险和刻薄的。他说：“穷的使，富的保”。没有富人作保，武训是不放债的。他还有一条限制：不够“三辈”的人家不放。这样，如果债务人死了，他还可以找下一代还账。当年，在临清运河上，有两名穷苦的闸夫，盖了一所小屋，就因为欠武训的高利贷，无法还清，小屋被没收抵债，后来这两个闸夫被活活折磨死了。武训耍弄流氓手段，在俺们这一带是臭名远扬的。上了年纪的人都知道，他是拜了许多妇女做所谓“干娘”的卑鄙下流的小丑。
    武训已经死了几十年了。但是，那些武训的奴隶主义的代言人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，人还在，心不死。他们借武训这具僵尸兴风作浪，毒害人民。俺们贫下中农一定要和这伙反革命修正主义分子算这笔账！
    毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”
    王伯成（冠县二中红卫兵，贫农出身）：
    武训这个坏家伙，封建统治者和国民党反动派拚命吹捧他，纪念他，为他立石碑，修坟墓，宣扬“武训精神”，麻痹人民，以维护他们的统治。
    毛主席教导我们说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们红卫兵小将响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，起来革命造反了。我们大破四旧，捣毁了颂扬武训的石碑，砸平了武训的坟墓，召开了几千人的大会，愤怒声讨武训的罪行，彻底批判“武训精神”，肃清武训的流毒。
    正当我们红卫兵小将起来大造武训的反，提出“砸烂武训坟墓，打倒‘武训精神’”的战斗口号时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派怕得要死，千方百计压制我们，不准我们造反，胡说什么“武训墓是名胜古迹”，是要“保护的文物”，等等。但是我们不听那一套，我们就是要造武训的反，非造武训这个大地主、大流氓、大骗子的反不可，反！反！反！造反到底，就是胜利！我们终于冲破了阻力，造了武训的反，取得了革命的胜利。我们造反的革命行动好得很，得到了广大贫下中农的支持和赞扬。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在一九五一年就提出批判反动影片《武训传》。但是，以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为总后台的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，千方百计抵制和破坏毛主席的伟大指示。在柳林，武训的臭坟墓十几年来还原封不动地保存着，散发着反动的臭气！我们今天要砸烂的不只是一个“武训墓”，而是彻底砸烂武训的奴隶主义！让党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他们的祖宗武训一起见鬼去吧！
    毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”
    常宝萍（柳林公社西街大队青年女社员，贫农）：
    看了反动影片《武训传》，俺心里气得火冒三丈。这部电影伸出了两只黑手，一手向武训脸上擦脂抹粉，把他打扮成云里来、雾里去，死了也没忘记“穷人”的活神仙；一手又往劳动人民脸上抹灰，千方百计地污蔑农民革命运动，要劳动人民取消武装斗争，走武训的道路，世世代代做奴隶。
    影片吹捧的武训，是个头顶长疮，脚底流脓的坏家伙。影片吹捧的“武训道路”，是一条向反动的封建统治者投降的道路。武训是个奴才，同时又是剥削农民的大地主，是放高利贷的寄生虫。他对农民起来打翻地主阶级的统治直翻白眼，怀着刻骨的仇恨。他打着办“义学”的旗号，瓦解革命群众的斗志。影片把“武训道路”吹捧成救国救民的道路，欺骗人们不要武装斗争，不要夺取政权，只要读书“就有好日子过”，“就不会被别人欺负”。这是一个很毒辣的维护反动统治的骗局！
    影片还极力丑化劳动人民，污蔑农民革命运动。它把为地主牵马赶车的周大安排作为农民革命的领袖，然后又往他脸上抹灰，把以周大为代表的农民革命大军，写成只知杀人放火东奔西窜的流寇，污蔑武装斗争不得人心。它还污蔑武装斗争不能解决“穷人”“受欺负”的问题，鼓吹农民要过“好日子”，就得走“武训道路”。影片要大家以武训为榜样，不要革命造反，跪在地上向地主统治阶级求饶；不要武装斗争，一心“修善积德”；不要夺取政权，埋头苦读诗书。
    武训这个坏蛋使用特殊的卑鄙手段，帮了反动统治阶级的忙，因而得到了反动头子们的嘉奖。这也是反革命修正主义分子周扬、夏衍及其总后台所以吹捧武训的根本所在。
    毛主席教导我们：“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”我们一定要把电影《武训传》这棵大毒草连根刨掉，打倒“武训精神”，清除《武训传》的一切反革命流毒！
