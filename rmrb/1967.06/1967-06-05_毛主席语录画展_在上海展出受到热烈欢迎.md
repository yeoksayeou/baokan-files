The "Quotations from Chairman Mao Exhibition" in Shanghai is warmly welcomed. The exhibition, themed around praising the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao and promoting the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, recently opened at the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace. This exhibition is held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The "Quotations from Chairman Mao Exhibition" is divided into eight sections: praising the great leader Chairman Mao, praising the great Chinese Communist Party; praising the "January Revolution"; praising the People's Liberation Army of China; literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers; promoting revolution and production; cultivating revolutionary successors; overthrowing the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road; and carrying the world revolution through to the end. The exhibition features over 400 works, with 70% of them created by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary art workers who participated in the creation of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Exhibition" hold boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, our red sun, and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They went deep into factories, rural areas, and military units, studying Chairman Mao's works with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, working and fighting alongside them, and creating and revising works together. To better reflect Mao Zedong Thought in the quotations paintings, both workers, peasants, and soldiers and professional authors emphasized studying Chairman Mao's works during the creation process. They studied and painted simultaneously, and many works are the fruits of their active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works.

The pioneering "Quotations from Chairman Mao Exhibition" has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards.
