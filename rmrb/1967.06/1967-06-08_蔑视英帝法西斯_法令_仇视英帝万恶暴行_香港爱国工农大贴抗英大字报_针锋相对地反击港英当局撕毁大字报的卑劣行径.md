Hong Kong patriotic workers and peasants respond to the call of the motherland, further mobilizing and organizing to resolutely counter the heinous British imperialism.

Following the transportation workers on land and water, workers at Kai Tak Airport, under the strict control of the British authorities, have also taken action. At 7:30 AM on the 5th, they posted anti-British big-character posters and propaganda posters inside and outside the repair shop of the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company at the airport, as well as the editorial from the People's Daily, "Resolutely Countering British Imperialist Provocations." The airport workers expressed that they are prepared to resolutely respond to the motherland's call to action and take even greater measures to counter British imperialist provocations at any time.

Fishermen have also taken action. Following the fishermen of Cheung Chau and Hong Kong Island, the fishermen of Tsing Yi have also established an anti-British oppression struggle committee on the 4th and passed a resolution expressing their firm support for the editorial from the People's Daily, "Resolutely Countering British Imperialist Provocations," and their readiness to respond to the call of the great motherland at any time to smash British imperialist reactionary rule. The fishermen of Hong Kong Island have also defied the British authorities' fascist "laws" and recently wrote slogans such as "All Hong Kong fishermen stand up!" and "Down with imperialism!" on the breakwater with bright red paint.

The cowardly British authorities have recently dispatched police at night to tear down the anti-British big-character posters of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots. The workers of Kowloon have resolutely taken countermeasures. On the 5th, all 1,000 day-shift workers from the Engineering Department of the Kowloon Motor Bus Company's factories in Green Mountain Road, Lai Chi Kok, To Kwa Wan, and Ngau Tau Kok stopped work for a day, strongly protesting the British authorities' dispatch of "riot control vehicles" and police cars, totaling more than 70, to surround the four factories in the early hours of the 4th, to tear down and deface the anti-British big-character posters posted by the Kowloon Motor Bus workers in the dark, and to point guns at the Engineering Department workers in provocative actions. In the morning of the 5th, the workers also held an anti-violence oath-taking rally, vowing to carry the struggle against British imperialist mad provocations to the end.

The "Star Ferry" workers marched in an orderly queue to the company office on the morning of the 5th, strongly protesting the British authorities' dispatch of a large number of police to board the ship and tear down big-character posters in the early hours of the 4th.

The Joint Struggle Committee of Hong Kong and Kowloon Bus Workers issued a joint statement on the 4th, protesting the British authorities' dispatch of a large number of "riot control teams" and plainclothes agents into the two factories in the early hours of that day to stealthily tear down big-character posters. The statement said that Dai Linzhi's continuous escalation of violence has caused us great indignation. We solemnly declare: our anti-violence big-character posters must be posted again, and we will post even more! We, the public bus workers, will resolutely escalate the anti-oppression struggle and, together with all the compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, be ready to respond to the motherland's call to action at any time to fight to the end to smash the British reactionary rule! The Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of various circles in Sai Kung, New Territories, was established on the 4th. At the founding meeting, the farmers angrily denounced that the British authorities owe us a blood debt, which must be repaid in blood. More than a hundred years of old and new grudges must be settled. After the meeting, the youths took to the streets and wrote large slogans such as "The Chinese people are not to be insulted," "British imperialism must fail, we must win," and "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand!" on the roads with paint. Their actions were met with enthusiastic cheers from nearby villagers.

The compatriots of Sha Tin District formed the Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee on the 4th and issued a statement, calling on the people of Sha Tin District to stand up and bravely advance in the struggle against British oppression. The statement particularly pointed out that since 1961, the British have implemented the so-called "long-term development plan," conducting multiple large-scale demolitions in the villages of Sha Tin, destroying the homes of countless villagers, causing them to be displaced, and causing countless villagers to lose their land and livelihood, unable to live and work in peace. The statement said, we, the villagers of Sha Tin District, harbor deep hatred for the British and their running dogs, which our descendants will never forget. Today, the fascist butchers of the British have brought their slaughter to our compatriots, adding more blood debts, old grudges as heavy as mountains, and new hatreds as deep as the sea. We must settle accounts with the British!

    继陆上和水上交通工人之后，在港英当局严密控制下的启德机场的中国工人也行动了起来。五日晨七时半，他们在香港飞机工程公司设在机场内的修理厂内外，首次贴出了抗议和揭露港英当局血腥暴行的大字报和宣传画，以及《人民日报》社论《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》。机场工人表示，他们已作好准备，要坚决响应祖国的战斗号召，随时采取更大的行动，反击英帝国主义的挑衅。
    渔民们也行动了起来。继长洲、香港仔之后，青山湾的渔民也在四日成立了反对港英迫害斗争委员会，并通过决议，表示坚决拥护《人民日报》社论《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》，随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，粉碎英帝国主义的反动统治。香港仔的渔民还藐视港英当局的法西斯“法令”，最近在防波堤上用鲜红的油漆写上“全港渔民站起来！”“打倒帝国主义！”等标语。
    卑鄙怯懦的港英当局，最近连续在夜里出动警察去撕毁香港爱国同胞的抗英大字报，港九工人针锋相对地坚决采取了对抗行动。九龙公共汽车公司工程部青山道厂、荔枝角厂、土瓜湾厂、角塘厂等日班全体工人一千人，五日停工一天，强烈抗议港英当局四日凌晨二时许出动“防暴车”、警车等七十多辆，武装包围上述四厂，摸黑撕毁及涂污九龙公共汽车工人张贴的抗英大字报，并用枪指吓工程部工人等挑衅行为。五日早上，工人们还举行了抗暴誓师大会，表示誓把反击英帝国主义疯狂挑衅的斗争进行到底。
    “天星”渡轮工人五日上午列着整齐的队伍，前往公司办公处，强烈抗议港英当局在四日凌晨三时许派出大批警察上船撕大字报的挑衅行为。
    香港、九龙公共汽车工人斗委会四日发表联合声明，抗议港英当局当天凌晨派出大批“防暴队”和便衣特务进入两厂，偷偷摸摸地撕去大字报的卑劣行径。声明说，戴麟趾不断把暴行升级，我们表示极大愤慨。我们严正宣布：我们的抗暴大字报，一定要再贴上去，并且要贴得更多！我们公共汽车工人，一定针锋相对地把反迫害斗争升级，誓与全港九同胞一起，随时准备响应祖国的战斗号召，为粉碎港英的反动统治而奋斗到底！新界西贡区各界反对港英迫害斗争委员会四日宣告成立。农民们在成立大会上愤怒地控诉说，港英当局欠下我们的血债，一定要用血来还，百多年来的新仇旧恨，一定要清算。大会结束后，青年们走上街头，用油漆在马路上写上“中国人民不可侮”、“英帝必败，我们必胜”、“毛主席万岁、万万岁”等大标语。他们的行动获得附近村民的热烈欢呼。
    沙田区各界同胞四日组成了反对港英迫害斗争委员会，并发表声明，号召沙田区同胞站起来，在反对港英当局迫害的斗争中奋勇向前。声明特别指出，自从一九六一年以来，港英推行所谓“长期发展计划”，在沙田各村进行多次大拆迁，多少乡民家园被毁，流离失所，多少乡民失地失耕，无以为生；多少乡民饱受欺骗、讹诈、恐吓、勒索，既不能安居，也不能乐业。声明说，我们沙田区乡民对港英及其走狗怀有刻骨仇恨，子子孙孙也忘不了。今天，港英法西斯强盗的屠刀杀到我们同胞的头上，又欠下我们一笔笔血债，旧恨重如山，新仇深似海，我们一定要和港英彻底清算！
