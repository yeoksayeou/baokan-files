Premier Zhou Enlai cables Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho

Representing Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and the Chinese people, we warmly congratulate the people of South Vietnam on their victory over the U.S. imperialists' second "dry season offensive."

New China News Agency, June 12th: Premier Zhou Enlai sent a cable on June 12th to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, representing Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and the Chinese people, to express the warmest congratulations to the people of South Vietnam for defeating the U.S. imperialists' second "dry season offensive" and achieving a great victory of significant strategic importance. The full text of the cable is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam,
Respected Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho:

The heroic people of South Vietnam, in their battles last winter and this spring, have fully demonstrated the immense power of people's war, defeating the U.S. imperialists' second "dry season offensive," annihilating a large number of American aggressor forces, and inflicting an unprecedented defeat on the enemy. This is a great victory of significant strategic importance. On behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and the Chinese people, I extend our warmest congratulations to you and all the people of South Vietnam!

The people of Vietnam are heroes standing tall and firm. Fourteen million people in South Vietnam, on seventeen thousand square kilometers of land, have fought against more than a million American and puppet troops, defeating them thoroughly. This is a miracle in the history of human liberation wars and a source of pride for all revolutionary people around the world!

The people of North Vietnam are also growing stronger in battle, with high morale, achieving the glorious feat of shooting down two thousand American aggressor planes. The great victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation have greatly encouraged the Chinese people, who are advancing victoriously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; and have set a brilliant example for the people of the Arab countries who are bravely fighting against the aggression of U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Mao said: "Create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the cause of the people. They will not deviate from this logic." No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists struggle, they will inevitably meet their final defeat in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people.

The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought stand firmly with our Vietnamese brothers, providing full support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, and thoroughly defeating the American aggressors. We are confident that in the near future, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation will achieve even more glorious and great victories.

Zhou Enlai

    周恩来总理致电阮友寿主席
    代表毛泽东主席林彪副主席和中国人民热烈祝贺南越人民打败美帝新的“旱季攻势”
    新华社十二日讯　周恩来总理十二日打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席，代表毛泽东主席、林彪副主席和中国人民，最热烈地祝贺越南南方人民打败了美帝国主义的第二个“旱季攻势”，取得了具有重大战略意义的伟大胜利。贺电全文如下：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团尊敬的阮友寿主席：
    英雄的越南南方人民，在去冬今春的战斗中，高度发扬了人民战争的无比威力，打败了美帝国主义的第二个“旱季攻势”，歼灭了美国侵略军大量有生力量，使敌人遭受了空前未有的惨败。这是一个具有重大战略意义的伟大胜利。我代表毛泽东主席、林彪副主席和中国人民，向您和全体越南南方人民，表示最热烈的祝贺！
    越南人民是顶天立地的英雄。一千四百万越南南方人民，在十七万平方公里的土地上，抗击着一百多万美、伪军，把他们打得落花流水，这是人类解放战争史上的奇迹，是全世界革命人民的骄傲！
    越南北方人民也愈战愈强，斗志昂扬，取得了击落美国强盗飞机二千架的辉煌战果。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，大大鼓舞了正在胜利地进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民；并且为正在进行反对美帝国主义的侵略而英勇斗争的阿拉伯各国人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”无论美帝国主义怎样进行垂死的挣扎，在英雄的越南人民面前，绝对逃脱不了最后失败的命运。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决地同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，彻底打败美国侵略者。我们坚信，在不久的将来，越南人民的抗美救国战争，还要取得更加辉煌伟大的胜利。
                              周恩来
                      一九六七年六月十二日
