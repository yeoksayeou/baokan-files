The Soviet revisionists' empty words cannot conceal their traitorous faces

The Central Committee of the Soviet revisionists passed a resolution at their plenary session to continue playing tricks of false support and real betrayal against the Arab people

They dare not condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression but shamelessly slander China's principled stand in support of the Arab people

New China News Agency, June 25: Moscow - The Soviet revisionist leaders convened a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on June 20 and 21, attempting to cover up their traitorous acts of serving as the U.S. imperialists' accomplices and betraying the interests of the Arab people, and in a fit of rage, they launched a vicious anti-China campaign.

The Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev delivered a report titled "On the Policy of the Soviet Union Toward Israeli Aggression in the Near East" at this plenary session. The session, based on his report, produced a "Resolution on the Policy of the Soviet Union Toward Israeli Aggression in the Near East."

This resolution claims that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "fully endorses the political line and practical actions of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee aimed at stopping Israeli aggression, supporting the Arab countries of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other Arab countries that have been attacked, and preventing the dangerous consequences of aggression for the cause of universal peace." This shows that the Soviet revisionist leadership continues to adhere to their counter-revolutionary line of colluding with U.S. imperialism to betray the Arab people.

Although the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pretends to "strongly condemn" Israeli aggression, it still, like the two statements issued by the Soviet government in the past, does not dare to condemn and expose the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism directly instigating and participating in the armed aggression against the Arab countries, nor does it support the struggle of the Arab countries and people against aggression.

The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists serving as the U.S. imperialists' accomplices and betraying the interests of the Arab people has been fully exposed before the Arab people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world. However, the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union absurdly claims that the Soviet revisionist leadership "stands on the side of the Arab people in their just struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, and for the right to solve all problems of their domestic life and foreign policy without interference."

The Soviet revisionists are doing everything they can to fuel the armed aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel against the Arab countries and to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's struggle against aggression. However, the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union shamelessly boasts about the crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership as "achievements," claiming that the "prompt, decisive, and joint actions" of the Soviet revisionist leadership and its followers "have played an important role in stopping military actions in the Near East."

The Soviet revisionist leadership is infuriated by the Chinese people's resolute support for the Arab people in their struggle against the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel, and their resolute exposure of the Soviet revisionist group's traitorous acts of false support and real betrayal on the Middle East issue. In this resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they shamelessly slander the principled stand of the Chinese people, which has been widely praised by the Arab people and revolutionary people of the world, as a "campaign of slander and divisive actions aimed at dispersing anti-imperialist forces and undermining the trust between the peoples of the Arab countries and the socialist countries."

In this resolution, the Soviet revisionist leadership once again raised the already bankrupt banner of so-called "united action," shouting that the "events in the Near East have once again forcefully emphasized the necessity for the communist and workers' parties, the international workers' movement, the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, all peace-loving forces and progressive forces, and all those who cherish the cause of freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries and the cause of universal peace to act in unison."

Through the recent savage aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel against the Arab countries, the Arab people and the people of the world have further recognized that U.S. imperialism is their number one enemy, and the Soviet revisionists are the U.S. imperialists' faithful accomplices. They have also further experienced that the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are their true friends.

The Soviet revisionists' resolution of false support and real betrayal can never cover up their heinous crimes; the Soviet leaders' anti-China incantations can only further expose their traitorous faces.

    苏修一纸空文掩不住叛徒嘴脸
    苏修中央全会通过决议继续玩弄对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的花招
    不敢谴责美帝侵略罪行却无耻污蔑中国支持阿拉伯人民的严正立场
    新华社二十五日讯莫斯科消息：苏修领导二十日和二十一日召开苏共中央全会，妄图掩饰他们充当美帝帮凶、出卖阿拉伯人民利益的叛徒行径，并气急败坏地恶毒反华。
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫，在这次全会上作了一个所谓“关于苏联对以色列在近东侵略的政策”的报告。会议根据他的报告炮制了“关于苏联对以色列在近东侵略的政策的决议”。
    这个决议宣称，苏共中央“完全赞同中央政治局旨在制止以色列侵略，支持遭到进攻的阿联、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家，为了普遍和平的事业而防止侵略的危险后果所执行的政治路线和实际活动。”这就表明了苏修领导集团仍然坚持他们勾结美帝国主义出卖阿拉伯人民的反革命路线。
    苏共中央的这个决议，虽然装模作样地表示“坚决谴责”以色列的侵略，但是仍然和苏联政府过去发表的两次声明一样，不敢谴责和揭露美帝国主义直接策动并参与对阿拉伯国家进行武装侵略的滔天罪行，也不支持阿拉伯国家和人民反侵略的斗争。
    苏修充当美帝帮凶出卖阿拉伯人民利益的叛徒面目，在阿拉伯人民、苏联人民和全世界人民面前已经暴露无遗。但是苏共中央的这个决议，却胡说什么苏修领导集团“在阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义和新殖民主义、争取自己解决自己国内生活和对外政策的所有问题的不可剥夺的权利的正义斗争中，站在他们一边”。
    苏修竭力助长美英以对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略，并千方百计扑灭阿拉伯人民的反侵略烈火。但是苏共中央决议却恬不知耻地把苏修领导集团的罪行当作“功绩”来吹嘘，不分黑白地说什么苏修领导集团及其追随者“迅速、果断和共同的行动，在停止近东军事行动方面起了重要作用”。
    苏修领导集团对中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美英以侵略、坚决揭露苏修集团在中东问题上假支持、真出卖的叛徒行径，大为恼火。这次苏共中央的决议中，竟无耻地把中国人民这种受到阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民普遍赞扬的严正立场，污蔑为“旨在涣散反帝力量、破坏阿拉伯国家人民和社会主义国家人民之间信任的诽谤运动和分裂行动”。
    苏修领导集团在这个决议中，又一次打出早已破产了的所谓“一致行动”的破旗，叫嚷什么“近东事件再次有力地强调说明共产党和工人党、国际工人运动和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民民族解放运动，一切爱好和平的力量和进步力量，所有珍视各国人民的自由和独立事业、珍视争取普遍和平事业的人行动一致的必要性”。
    阿拉伯人民和全世界人民，通过最近美英以对阿拉伯国家发动的野蛮侵略，已经进一步认清了美帝国主义是他们的头号敌人，苏修是美帝的忠实帮凶。他们也从这次事件中进一步体验到用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是他们的真正朋友。
    苏修领导集团那一张假支持、真出卖的“决议”，绝对掩盖不了他们的滔天罪行；苏修头头们的反华咒语，只能进一步暴露他们的叛徒嘴脸。
