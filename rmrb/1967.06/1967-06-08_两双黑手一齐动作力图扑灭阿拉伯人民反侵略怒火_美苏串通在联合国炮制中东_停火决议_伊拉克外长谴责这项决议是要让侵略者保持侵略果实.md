Two black hands are working together to extinguish the anger of the Arab people against aggression. The U.S. and the Soviet Union collude in the United Nations to draft a Middle East "ceasefire resolution." The Iraqi Foreign Minister denounces this resolution as allowing the aggressors to retain the fruits of their aggression.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) — The Soviet revisionist leadership clique openly collaborated with U.S. imperialism in the United Nations on June 6 to draft a "ceasefire resolution" on the Middle East issue, attempting to extinguish the Arab countries' struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, with their two black hands.

After Soviet revisionist representative Fedelin and U.S. representative Goldberg held two secret bilateral meetings on June 6 and reached an agreement, they manipulated the United Nations Security Council to hastily pass a "resolution" demanding that the governments concerned in the Middle East "immediately achieve a ceasefire." Western news agencies reported that this "ceasefire resolution" was a "victory for Western diplomacy," and the content of the "resolution" was "exactly what the U.S. and Britain had been striving for from the beginning." The Soviet representative, after directly consulting Moscow, "obediently voted" in the Security Council.

U.S. Senate Democratic leader Mansfield, after meeting with U.S. President Johnson on June 6, also openly stated that the U.S. and the Soviet Union were "closely cooperating" and "working together" on the Middle East situation.

U.S. imperialism publicly propagandizes the "joint action" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union because it has already figured out the Soviet revisionists' bottom line and obtained their "guarantee." The U.S. Christian Science Monitor reported that Washington and Moscow had "exchanged important, highly secret opinions," and Johnson had sent an urgent letter to Kosygin around mid-May, to which Kosygin promptly replied. The Agence France-Presse in Washington reported on June 6 that Washington and Moscow had already had "official diplomatic exchanges" on the Middle East issue, and direct contacts had begun between the U.S. and Soviet representatives in the United Nations. "The Soviet Union has assured the United States that it is eager to prevent the war from escalating."

The U.S.-Soviet colluded "immediate ceasefire" United Nations "resolution" is completely in favor of U.S. imperialism and the Israeli aggressors, and blatantly opposes the Arab countries' just war against aggression. After the U.S. and the Soviet Union manipulated the United Nations Security Council to pass the "ceasefire resolution," the Syrian representative spoke out, denouncing the U.S. and Britain's participation in Israel's aggressive war against the Arab countries, pointing out that this "ceasefire resolution" was "recognizing the status quo created by Israel." Iraqi Foreign Minister Pachachi denounced this "resolution" as "completely surrendering to Israel," allowing "the aggressor to retain its fruits of aggression."

The New York Times acknowledged on June 7 that the United Nations' "ceasefire resolution" was beneficial for Israel to realize its aggressive ambitions. This U.S. newspaper said that after the United Nations passed the "ceasefire resolution," "Israeli forces obviously did not stop advancing, nor would they retreat unless they were guaranteed the opening of the Gulf of Aqaba." The New York Times also openly urged the Soviet revisionists to work further with the United States to "solve the problem."

The so-called United Nations "ceasefire resolution" colluded by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is essentially the same as the Soviet revisionist clique's government statement on June 5, which advocated for the United Nations to "immediately take necessary measures to restore peace in the Near East" and for the "great powers" to "extinguish the war in the Near East and restore peace." Its essence is to extinguish the Arab people's anti-aggression flames. This clearly shows that the Soviet revisionist clique, which verbally "supports" the Arab countries, is actually working hard to sell out the fundamental interests of the Arab people and is everywhere acting as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

    两双黑手一齐动作力图扑灭阿拉伯人民反侵略怒火
    美苏串通在联合国炮制中东“停火决议”
    伊拉克外长谴责这项决议是要让侵略者保持侵略果实
    新华社七日讯　苏联修正主义领导集团六日在联合国公开同美帝国主义采取联合行动，就中东问题串通一气炮制出一项“停火决议”，企图用它们两双黑手活生生地把阿拉伯国家反对美帝及其工具以色列侵略的斗争怒火扑灭下去。
    苏修驻联合国代表费德林和美国代表戈德堡在六日接连举行两次秘密双边会谈达成协议以后，就操纵联合国安全理事会马上匆匆一致通过了一项“决议”，要中东各有关政府“立即实现停火”。西方通讯社的消息说，这项“停火决议”是“西方外交的胜利”，“决议”的内容“正是美英从一开始就竭力要求的”，苏联代表在直接请示莫斯科以后，在安理会里“顺从地投了票”。
    美国参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德六日在同美国总统约翰逊会谈后，也毫不掩饰地说，苏美两国在中东局势中正在“密切地共同努力”和“合作”。
    美帝国主义这样公开宣传苏美“联合行动”，是因为它已经摸透了苏修的底，得到了苏修的“保证”。美国《基督教科学箴言报》报道，华盛顿和莫斯科已经“交换重要的、高度秘密的意见”，约翰逊大约在五月中旬“送给柯西金一封紧急信件”，柯西金跟着就给了约翰逊回信。法新社华盛顿六日消息也说，华盛顿同莫斯科之间在中东问题上已经有“正式的外交来往”，在纽约已经开始了美苏驻联合国代表之间“直接的接触”，“苏联已向美国保证说苏联很想尽力防止战争扩大”。
    美苏合谋的“立即实现停火”的联合国“决议”，是完全有利于美帝及以色列侵略者，而露骨反对反侵略的正义战争的阿拉伯国家的。在美苏操纵联合国安理会通过“停火决议”以后，叙利亚代表发言谴责美英参与了以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略战争行动，指出这项“停火决议”是“承认以色列所造成的现状”。伊拉克外交部长帕查奇谴责这项“决议”是“完全向以色列投降”，是允许“侵略者保持它的侵略果实”。
    《纽约时报》七日也承认，联合国这项“停火决议”是有利于以色列实现其侵略野心的。这家美国报纸说，在联合国通过“停火决议”以后，“以色列部队显然并没有停止前进，更不会撤退，除非它获得（亚喀巴）海湾将予开放的保证”。《纽约时报》还公开要苏修进一步同美国“一道工作”来求得问题的“解决”。
    美苏合谋的所谓联合国的“停火决议”，说穿了就是苏修集团在五日的政府声明中所极力鼓吹的要联合国来“火速采取恢复近东和平所必要的措施”、要“大国”来“熄灭近东的战火和恢复和平”的再版，其实质就是要扑灭阿拉伯人民的反侵略的战火。这清楚地表明，口头上“支持”阿拉伯国家的苏修集团，实际上正在竭力出卖阿拉伯人民的根本利益，处处为美帝国主义充当头号帮凶。
