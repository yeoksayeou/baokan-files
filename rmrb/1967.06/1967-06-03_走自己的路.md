For more than a decade, our symphonic music stage has been flooded with decadent and declining music from the 18th century in the West. A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, represented by Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo Han, have elevated bourgeois symphonic music to the heavens. They have praised to the skies those symphonic works that extol the decadent lives and ugly souls of masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies, describing them as having "sad themes," "dreamlike movements," "the masterful techniques of artistic giants," "exquisite artistic achievements," and so on. They slander that "workers, peasants, and soldiers have no culture, do not understand art, and cannot appreciate symphonic music." The class enemies attempt to corrupt the people and intimidate the masses into bowing down to the dead foreigners, thereby creating public opinion for their goal of restoring capitalism.

History is merciless. New forces will ultimately triumph over decay. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution smashed the headquarters of the biggest clique of capital roaders within the Party. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has given symphonic music a revolutionary new life. "We must not follow the foreigners to their deaths; we must walk our own path." "The White-Haired Girl" opened up the broad highway for symphonic music to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to serve proletarian politics.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the personal direction of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolutionary comrades of the Central Philharmonic have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of making the past serve the present and making foreign things serve China. They have stormed the stronghold of symphonic music and successfully created symphonic music that the workers, peasants, and soldiers love to hear and see. They have created towering images of heroes such as Guo Jian Guang, the commander of the New Fourth Army, and A Qing, the underground liaison officer. The birth of the symphonic music "The White-Haired Girl" has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampened the spirits of the bourgeoisie.

The symphonic music "The White-Haired Girl" vividly and symbolically represents the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao's people's war. It establishes the newness of socialism and the uniqueness of the proletariat. Those counter-revolutionary revisionists say: "This is a 'monster.'" The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love this "monster." Because it serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serves proletarian politics, it is our proletarian symphonic music. Such a "monster" is good, is good!

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "In form, one must dare to create, be unique, and innovate. One must dare to think and act, not fear being called novel, and must be creative, captivating, thought-provoking, and truly infectious, loved by the people." The symphonic music "The White-Haired Girl," guided by Mao Zedong Thought, is such a good model.

The revolutionary symphonic music "The White-Haired Girl" has written a new, epoch-making page in the history of symphonic music. Its appearance will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact worldwide. All those "sad themes," "dreamlike movements," and all the old bourgeois symphonic music, go to hell!

    走自己的路

    十多年来，我们的交响音乐舞台上泛滥着西方十八世纪的腐朽没落的音乐。以周扬、夏衍、林默涵为代表的文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子把资产阶级的交响音乐捧上了天，把那些宣扬老爷太太少爷小姐的腐朽生活及其丑恶灵魂的交响音乐说得神乎其神，什么“悲伤的主题”，“梦幻的乐章”，“艺术大师的高超手法”，“绝妙的艺术造诣”，等等，等等。他们污蔑“工农兵没有文化，不懂得艺术，听不懂交响音乐”。阶级敌人妄图以此来腐蚀人民，吓唬群众拜倒于洋人死人的脚下，以达到他们为复辟资本主义制造舆论的目的。
    历史是无情的。新生的力量终究要战胜腐朽的东西。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，砸烂了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阎王殿。战无不胜的毛泽东思想使交响音乐获得了革命的新生。“不能跟着洋人去死，一定要走自己的路。”《沙家浜》开辟了交响音乐为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的康庄大道。
    中央乐团革命的同志们，在毛泽东思想的指引下，在江青同志的亲自指导下，贯彻执行了毛主席的古为今用、洋为中用的方针，攻克了交响音乐这个顽固堡垒，成功地创造了工农兵喜闻乐见的交响音乐，塑造了新四军指导员郭建光、地下联络员阿庆嫂等高大的英雄形象。交响音乐《沙家浜》的诞生，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》生动地、形象地表现了毛主席的人民战争的光辉思想。它标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。那些反革命修正主义分子说：这是个“怪物”，广大工农兵群众就是喜欢这个“怪物”。因为它是为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的，它是我们无产阶级自己的交响音乐。这样的“怪物”就是好，就是好！
    林彪副主席说：“在形式上要大胆创造、别出心裁、花样翻新，要敢想敢干，不要怕人说标新立异，要有创造性，要引人入胜，发人深思，要真正感染人，为人民所热爱。”以毛泽东思想为指针的交响音乐《沙家浜》，就是这种好样板。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，在交响乐的历史上写下了新的具有划时代意义的一页。它的出现，必将在全世界产生巨大的影响。什么“悲伤的主题”，什么“梦幻的乐章”，一切旧的资产阶级的交响乐，统统见鬼去吧！
