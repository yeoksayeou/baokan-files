Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power, consolidating power." This great teaching points the proletariat in the right direction and inspires their fighting spirit. The proletariat must adhere to the principle of violent revolution, overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie, and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. After seizing power, they must defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, prevent the restoration of capitalism, build socialism, and ultimately achieve communism. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the lifeline of the revolutionary people.

The historical experience of the proletarian revolution tells us that all revisionists, as long as they do not touch the reactionary regime, also talk about class struggle, but once they guide the class struggle to the dictatorship of the proletariat, they fall silent. The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party, in the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," also abstractly talks about some phrases of class struggle, but when it comes to the issue of state power, it says: "It must be through the hands of the Communist Parties and the people of each country to transform their own countries."

On the issue of the state, genuine Marxist-Leninists believe that it is necessary to seize power by force, overthrow the reactionary rule, smash the bourgeois state machine, and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party does not discuss the issue of seizing power, does not discuss the issue of smashing the old state machine, but abstractly and vaguely talks about using "one's own hands to transform one's own country." This is a trick used by all revisionists. They always deliberately castrate the soul of Marxism-Leninism and avoid the key issue of armed seizure of power and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao summed up the experience of the proletarian revolution and put forward the famous thesis that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Chairman Mao pointed out: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, without which one cannot complete the leap in social development, overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and enable the people to seize power."

History has proven that it was under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao that the Chinese people, after a long and arduous armed struggle, won the victory of the people's revolution and established New China, a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

After overthrowing the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people faced a serious problem: whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road? Whether to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." "The bourgeois republic, which other countries have had, China cannot have, because China is a country oppressed by imperialism." "Summing up our experience, it boils down to this: the dictatorship of the proletariat (through the Communist Party) led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants."

However, the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party goes against this. "Self-Cultivation," revised and published in 1949 just as the Chinese people were about to seize national power, still does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat but vaguely talks about "transforming the world into a communist world." This is a big conspiracy. "Self-Cultivation" talks about "transforming the world into a communist world" is a lie, opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat is the truth.

Lenin pointed out: "The development towards communism must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot go through any other path." Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is impossible to talk about realizing communism, but only about developing capitalism. The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is precisely to prepare public opinion for his implementation of capitalism in China.

The facts are exactly like this. The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party has been enthusiastically advocating the bourgeoisie's "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation is glorious." He blathers on about: "The exploitative system of capitalism cannot be abolished today. Some people say that it is better to have someone exploit than to have no one exploit. Without exploitation, workers will be unemployed. Therefore, it is not that there are too many capitalists, but that there are too few capitalists. Therefore, capitalism should be allowed to develop a little more, that is, to develop capitalist exploitation." He also advocates "long-term preservation of the rich peasant economy," promotes "four freedoms," and loudly proclaims "consolidating the new democratic order," attempting to make capitalism eternal in China. The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party is a figure who represents the reactionary bourgeoisie in picking "peaches." He attempts to steal the fruits that the Chinese people have gained under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party after decades of struggle, trying to drag China back to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. This is sheer fantasy.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have resolutely implemented the Party's general line for the transitional period and successfully completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.

However, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation in terms of ownership, class struggle is far from over. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere are long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense."

At this very moment, the biggest careerist within the Party, in order to realize his dream of capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration in China, has been spreading the theory of "extinction of class struggle" and opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat. He rants on about: "Class struggle has passed"; "Now there are no landlords, the bourgeoisie has been eliminated by us"; "After the public-private partnership, the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved." In 1962, at the very moment when our country suffered three consecutive years of natural disasters and domestic and foreign class enemies launched wave after wave of anti-China and anti-communist counter-revolutionary reversals, he threw out the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" again, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In "Self-Cultivation," he says: "After victory, one must patiently and for a long time carry out the transformation of social economy and thought culture, in order to eliminate the influence and traditional habits of the exploiting class among the people, and to establish a new social economic system, a new communist culture, and social morals." Here, he still does not talk about the dictatorship of the proletariat but sings high about communism, which is all deceitful talk. Ask: Without class struggle, without the dictatorship of the proletariat, how can one transform the social economy? How can one transform thought culture? How can one eliminate the influence of the exploiting class among the people? How can one establish a new communist culture? This is not a shameless betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat tells us that socialist society is still built on the basis of class antagonism. The exploiting class has been overthrown, but it has not been completely eliminated. We have confiscated their material possessions, but we cannot confiscate the reactionary thoughts in their minds. They are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They are always trying to restore capitalism in China and dream of returning to their past "paradise." Although they occupy a very small proportion of the population, their political energy is great, and they still occupy a considerable advantage in the ideological and cultural front.

Therefore, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Only in this way can we prevent the restoration of capitalism and ensure that our country will never change color.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a sharp class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie's conspiracy to restore power. It is a matter of the first importance concerning the fate and future of the Party and the state, and it is also a matter of the first importance concerning the world revolution. Chairman Mao has creatively solved the theoretical and practical problems of carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. This is a tremendously great development and contribution of Chairman Mao to Marxism-Leninism.

In this extremely sharp and intense class struggle, the author of "Self-Cultivation," who does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat, has put forward a bourgeois reactionary line, distorting right and wrong, confusing black and white, encircling the revolutionary faction, and implementing white terror, attempting to suppress the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He maliciously and cunningly implements the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number" on the issue of cadres. This completely exposes this "Self-Cultivation" expert, who does not mention the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as a great conspirator who is engaged in activities to restore bourgeois dictatorship and capitalist restoration!

"Self-Cultivation" does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is a betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The top careerist is a traitor to the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    头号野心家背叛无产阶级专政
    上海社会科学院　革命造反兵团巨浪战斗队
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”这一伟大的教导，给无产阶级指明了方向，鼓舞了斗志。无产阶级必须坚持暴力革命的原则，推翻资产阶级的反动统治，建立无产阶级专政；而在取得政权以后，必须保卫和巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，才能防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，并在将来实现共产主义。无产阶级专政是革命人民的命根子。
    无产阶级革命的历史经验告诉我们，一切修正主义者只要不触动反动政权，也讲一些阶级斗争的骗人鬼话，但是一旦把阶级斗争引导到无产阶级专政，他们就噤若寒蝉了。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》这株大毒草中，也抽象地讲了一些阶级斗争的词句，而在谈到国家政权问题时，却说什么：“要经过各国共产党和各国人民自己的手，去改造自己的国家”。
    在国家问题上，真正的马克思列宁主义者认为，必须要用暴力夺取政权，推翻反动统治，打碎资产阶级的国家机器，建立无产阶级专政。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，根本不谈夺取政权的问题，根本不谈打碎旧的国家机器的问题，而抽象地笼统地说什么要用“自己的手，去改造自己的国家”。这就是一切修正主义者惯用的伎俩。他们总是处心积虑地阉割马克思列宁主义的灵魂，极力回避武装夺取政权、建立无产阶级专政这个要害问题。
    毛主席总结了无产阶级革命的经验，提出了“枪杆子里面出政权”的著名论断。毛主席指出：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    历史证明，我国人民正是在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，经过了长期的艰苦的武装斗争，才取得了人民革命的胜利，建立了无产阶级专政的新中国。
    中国人民在推翻了蒋介石反动统治以后，面临着一个严重的问题：是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？是建立无产阶级专政，还是建立资产阶级专政？
    毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”“资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有，因为中国是受帝国主义压迫的国家。”“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。”
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却反其道而行之。《修养》在一九四九年我国人民即将夺得全国政权的时候修改出笼，仍然闭口不谈无产阶级专政，却含糊其词地说什么“要把世界改造成为共产主义的世界”。这是一个大阴谋。《修养》大谈“改造成为共产主义的世界”是假，反对无产阶级专政是真。
    列宁指出：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路”。离开无产阶级专政，就根本谈不上实现共产主义，而只能发展资本主义。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派闭口不谈无产阶级专政，正是为他在中国实行资本主义制造舆论准备的。
    事实正是这样。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，到处狂热地宣扬资产阶级“剥削有功”、“剥削光荣”。他胡说什么：“资本主义的剥削制度今天还不能废除，有人说，有人剥削比没有人剥削好，没有人剥削，工人就会失业，所以不是资本家太多了，而是资本家太少了，所以还应使资本主义有若干发展，即是要发展资本主义剥削。”他还主张“长期保存富农经济”，提倡“四大自由”，大肆叫嚷“巩固新民主主义秩序”，妄图使资本主义在中国永世长存。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是代表反动资产阶级来摘“桃子”的人物。他妄图窃取中国人民在毛主席和共产党领导下，经过几十年斗争所取得的成果，把中国拉回到半封建、半殖民地的老路上去。这完全是痴心妄想。
    中国人民在毛主席的领导下，坚决地贯彻了党的过渡时期总路线，胜利地完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    但是，在所有制方面基本完成社会主义改造以后，阶级斗争远未结束。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    就在这个时候，党内最大的野心家为了在中国实现其资本主义反革命复辟的美梦，极力散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，反对无产阶级专政。他胡说什么：“阶级斗争已经过去了”；“现在再没有地主阶级，资产阶级被我们消灭了”；“公私合营以后，无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”。一九六二年，正当我国连续三年遭受自然灾害，国内外阶级敌人掀起了一股又一股反华反共的反革命逆流的时刻，他又把《修养》这株大毒草重新修改抛出来，为复辟资本主义作舆论准备。他在《修养》中说：“在取得胜利以后，还要长期地耐心地进行社会经济的改造和思想文化的改造，才能肃清剥削阶级在人民中的一切影响和传统习惯等，并且建立新的社会经济制度、新的共产主义的文化和社会道德。”在这里，他仍然不谈无产阶级专政，却高唱什么共产主义，这完全是骗人的鬼话。试问：离开阶级斗争，离开无产阶级专政，怎样去改造社会经济？怎样去改造思想文化？怎样去肃清剥削阶级在人民中的一切影响？又怎样去建立新的共产主义文化？这不是无耻地背叛无产阶级专政又是什么！
    无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，社会主义社会还是建立在阶级对立的基础上。剥削阶级是打倒了，但是没有完全消灭。我们没收了他们的物质，但是不能没收他们头脑中的反动思想。他们人还在，心不死。他们每日每时总是企图在中国实现资本主义复辟，梦想恢复他们过去的“天堂”。尽管他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但他们的政治能量很大，在思想文化阵地上还占相当的优势。
    因此，我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的教导，巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底。只有这样，才能防止资本主义复辟，使我们的国家永不变色。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级反对资产阶级阴谋复辟的尖锐的阶级斗争。它是关系到党和国家的命运、前途的头等大事，也是关系到世界革命的头等大事。毛主席创造性地解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的一个极其伟大的发展和贡献。
    在这一场极其尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争中，闭口不谈无产阶级专政的《修养》的炮制者，却抛出了资产阶级反动路线，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，实行白色恐怖，妄想将轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。他用心险恶、诡计多端地在干部问题上推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。这就完全暴露出这个闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题的“修养家”，原来是一个搞资产阶级专政、搞资本主义复辟活动的大阴谋家！
    《修养》闭口不谈无产阶级专政，就是背叛无产阶级专政。
    头号野心家是无产阶级专政的叛徒。
