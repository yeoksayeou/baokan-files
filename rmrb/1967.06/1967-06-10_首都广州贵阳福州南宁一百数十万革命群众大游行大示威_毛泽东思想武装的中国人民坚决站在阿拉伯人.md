Massive demonstrations and rallies were held in Beijing, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Fuzhou, and Nanning, with hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses participating. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stand with the Arab people.

The people of Beijing, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Fuzhou, and Nanning have held massive demonstrations and rallies in recent days, condemning the criminal actions of U.S. and British imperialism in instigating and manipulating Israel to launch an aggressive war. They have also strongly condemned the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionists in encouraging aggression and colluding with U.S. imperialism to force Arab countries to stop their resistance.

The people firmly believe that the Arab people will definitely strengthen their unity, fight to the end, overcome all difficulties, and achieve victory.

The New China News Agency reported on the 9th that the revolutionary masses of the capital continued to hold demonstrations and rallies today, firmly supporting the Arab people's just struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression. Over the past three days, more than 120 million people in the city have participated in demonstrations and rallies.

Today's demonstrations in the capital reached their peak. From morning to night, crowds from factories, offices, schools, neighborhoods, and rural communes poured into the streets like a tide, heading towards the embassies of the United Arab Republic and other Arab countries in China, as well as the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing. They expressed that the Chinese people stand firmly with the one billion Arab people, supporting their just struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression to the end. The demonstrators strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism in proposing a "ceasefire within a specified time" at the United Nations, forcing Arab countries to stop their resistance.

The powerful demonstration crowds surged towards the British consulate, their anger boiling over. People waved their fists in the air, shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" The demonstrators strongly condemned the fascist atrocities of British imperialism and firmly supported the heroic struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.

Since the 7th, the people of the capital have carried portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, held up red flags, banners, various cartoons, and copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marching to the gates of the embassies of the United Arab Republic and other Arab countries in China to hold grand demonstrations. At the gates of the embassies, people read aloud the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The revolutionary masses of the capital used the most powerful weapon—the great Mao Zedong Thought—to strongly support the Arab people's struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression.

The revolutionary workers from various industries in the capital, including steel, machinery, chemical, light industry, transportation, and commerce, stood firmly with the Arab people. The revolutionary workers from the "East Is Red" headquarters and the "Smash Privileges, Establish Public Ownership" combat headquarters of the Capital Steel Company marched from their factory, 25 kilometers away, to participate in the demonstration. In their letter of support to the Arab people, they said: U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Arab people. The Chinese working class, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, stands firmly with the Arab people, vowing to be their strong backbone.

The male and female commune members from the suburbs of Beijing, such as Xinghuo, Pingfang, Nanmashi, and Gaobeidian, who rushed from the summer harvest front to participate in the demonstration, expressed the support of the 500 million Chinese peasants for the heroic Arab people. Their representative read aloud a letter of support at the Syrian embassy, stating that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, these paper tigers, are most afraid of the Arab people's just struggle. As long as the Arab people strengthen their unity and persist in their long-term struggle, overcoming all difficulties, they will definitely achieve ultimate victory.

The vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital, the Red Guards, have held demonstrations and rallies over the past few days, filled with intense hatred for the enemy and deep affection for their friends. They angrily condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism, British imperialism, and Soviet revisionism. The Red Guards pointed out that the purpose of U.S. imperialism in instigating this aggressive war is to try to suppress the Arab people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, in order to control and enslave the people of various Arab countries. British imperialism is a co-conspirator in this war. The Soviet revisionist leadership has once again played the shameful role of the chief accomplice. They collude to try to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's just struggle. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly with the Arab people, supporting the Arab people's anti-aggression war. U.S. imperialism will be defeated! The Arab people will be victorious!

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing, Jalib, received the revolutionary masses of the capital who came to support the Arab people's just struggle several times. He said: The support of the Chinese people has strengthened our confidence in the struggle, making our struggle more resolute and determined to achieve greater victories. The Palestinian people and the Arab people will continue to study the works of Chairman Mao. We believe that Chairman Mao's works are the most powerful weapons against imperialism and Zionism. The Palestinian people believe that the Chinese people are their most intimate friends.

In front of the British consulate, the protests reached their peak. The angry crowds from all directions filled the wide streets, and the sky-shaking slogans and countless protest letters, big-character posters, propaganda paintings, and large banners, as well as street performances, expressed the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to support the Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle and their strong protest against the Hong Kong authorities' persecution of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The rural commune members who came to demonstrate pointed out in anger that British imperialism has been brutally oppressing and exploiting our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong for many years, owing us a mountain of blood debts. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, warn British imperialism: The days of your rampage on Chinese soil are gone forever. All the old and new debts you owe the Chinese people, we will definitely settle them completely.

Many foreign experts in Beijing also demonstrated at the British consulate, protesting against British imperialism's aggression against the Arab people.

The New China News Agency reported on the 9th that in recent days, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses in Guangzhou, Guiyang, Fuzhou, and Nanning held meetings and demonstrations, angrily condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel in launching armed aggression against the Arab people, and expressing their resolute support for the Arab people's just struggle.

The revolutionary people of Guangzhou formed a vast anti-imperialist army on the 8th, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao and banners firmly supporting the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle, and held a demonstration. The revolutionary masses participating in the demonstration pointed out that U.S. imperialism has committed heinous crimes in Vietnam. British imperialism recently carried out bloody suppression against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, and the blood debt has not been settled. Now, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, it instigated Israel to brazenly invade Arab countries, owing the world people another new blood debt. We must join the people of Arab countries and revolutionary people around the world to fight them head-on and definitely defeat them.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Red Guards, and People's Liberation Army soldiers in the mountain city of Guiyang held a grand rally and demonstration on the 8th, with more than 100,000 people participating. The representative of the Guiyang Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Proletariat pointed out in his speech that Chairman Mao taught us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel will definitely not escape destruction. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Guizhou, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically support the statement of our government, firmly support the Arab people's just struggle, and vow to be their strong backbone.

Nearly 40,000 revolutionary workers, peasants, office staff, and Red Guards in the coastal defense city of Fuzhou held a rally and a grand demonstration on the evening of the 8th. The people at the rally and demonstration angrily pointed out that the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel against the Arab people is a serious provocation to the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. U.S., British, and Soviet revisionists collude to openly use the United Nations to play the "ceasefire" trick, trying to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. The seven hundred million Chinese people and Red Guards, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, stand firmly with the Arab people.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Red Guards, revolutionary students, teachers, and cadres in Nanning held a rally and demonstration today to support the Arab people's just struggle. In their speeches, they angrily condemned U.S. imperialism as the mastermind behind instigating and manipulating Israel to launch this aggressive war, the most vicious enemy of the Arab people, and the number one enemy of the world people. They condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for once again exposing its ugly face of betraying the Arab people in this incident. They expressed their belief that all revolutionary people around the world stand with the Arab people, and the final victory will definitely belong to the Arab people.

    山城贵阳无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将、人民解放军指战员十万多人八日举行盛大集会和示威游行。贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部的代表在会上讲话说，毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义及其走狗以色列也决逃不脱灭亡的命运。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的贵州无产阶级革命派热烈拥护我国政府的声明，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，誓作他们的坚强后盾。
