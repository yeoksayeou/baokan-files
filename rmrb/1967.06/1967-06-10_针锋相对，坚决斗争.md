A revolutionary mass movement that hates, despises, and scorns British imperialism is deeply developing in Hong Kong. This magnificent mass movement, like the surging waves of the sea, is rising higher and higher, striking at the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

As Chairman Mao teaches us, "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause." Currently, British imperialism is still stubbornly resisting in Hong Kong, making desperate struggles. It not only refuses to admit its guilt but also has carried out new persecutions against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, creating new bloody suppression incidents. This is another blood debt that British imperialism owes to the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The more imperialism and reactionaries face death, the more frantic and brutal they become. British imperialism is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It tries to cover up its cowardice with doubled brutality and its weakness with doubled madness. This precisely reflects its panic-stricken mentality of not knowing whether it can survive the day.

British imperialism is a bunch of utterly stupid fools. They always misjudge the situation and underestimate the power and determination of the people. With the mentality of robbers and gamblers, they continue to act recklessly, taking desperate measures, foolishly thinking they can suppress the great anti-British and anti-violence struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and foolishly thinking that the Chinese people will stop and tolerate their rampant behavior in Hong Kong. We must solemnly warn British imperialism that this is absolutely impossible. You insist on being enemies of the Chinese people, and you will only meet your doom like moths flying into a flame.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that in dealing with imperialism and all reactionaries, our policy is to stand firm and fight resolutely. British imperialism is provoking our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Chinese people in a mad frenzy. We must definitely give a resolute counterattack to every aggression of the enemy until we completely smash it!

The enemy oppresses, we resist, and we resist to the end.

The enemy provokes, we counterattack, and we counterattack doubly.

The enemy implements fascist decrees, we must adopt various forms of struggle to fight against the enemy.

The enemy conducts illegal trials, we must turn the enemy's court into a platform to expose British imperialism and conduct a people's just trial against British imperialism.

The enemy engages in political deception, we must resolutely expose it, resolutely mobilize the masses to accuse British imperialism of its bloody crimes, and widely and deeply carry out a mass movement to hate, despise, and scorn British imperialism, making it known to every household.

The enemy bans the propagation of the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong, we must propagandize the thoughts of Mao Zedong loudly and clearly, making the enemy tremble before the great thoughts of Mao Zedong!

The enemy is sharpening its knife, and we must also sharpen our knife. We, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, must seriously deal with the new threats and provocations of British imperialism. We must thoroughly settle accounts with the heinous crimes of British imperialism over more than a hundred years of invading China, seizing Hong Kong, annexing Kowloon, and plundering the New Territories. We, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, must be fully prepared to launch a new high tide of anti-British and anti-violence struggle, and launch a more powerful counterattack against the enemy. Workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and all revolutionary masses across the country must be fully prepared to support the struggle of the Hong Kong compatriots with practical actions.

Compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, let us unite more closely, fight resolutely, and definitely tear this paper tiger of British imperialism to shreds!

    针锋相对，坚决斗争
    本报评论员
    一场仇视、鄙视、蔑视英帝国主义的革命群众运动，正在香港深入地发展。这个波澜壮阔的革命群众运动，象大海的怒潮一样，一浪高过一浪地冲击着英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。
    正如毛主席教导我们的那样，“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”。目前，英帝国主义还在香港负隅顽抗，进行着疯狂的挣扎。它不仅没有低头认罪，而且还对我港九爱国同胞进行了新的迫害，制造了新的血腥镇压事件。这是英帝国主义对港九同胞欠下的又一笔血债。
    帝国主义和反动派，越是面临死亡，就越是疯狂，越是残暴。英帝国主义是外强中干、色厉内荏的纸老虎。它力图用加倍的残暴来掩盖它的怯懦，用加倍的疯狂来掩盖它的虚弱。这恰恰反映了它的那种朝不保夕的恐慌心理。
    英帝国主义是一批愚蠢透顶的家伙。他们总是错误地估计形势，错误地估计人民的力量和决心。他们抱着强盗和赌徒的心理，继续蛮干，孤注一掷，妄想把港九爱国同胞这一场伟大的反英抗暴斗争压下去，妄想中国人民会就此罢休，容忍他们在香港胡作非为。我们要严正警告英帝国主义，这是绝对办不到的。你们坚持与中国人民为敌，只能是飞蛾扑火，自取灭亡。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，对付帝国主义和一切反动派，我们的方针是针锋相对，坚决斗争。英帝国主义向我港九爱国同胞和中国人民进行疯狂挑衅，我们就一定要给予敌人的每一个进攻以坚决的回击，直至把它彻底粉碎！
    敌人压迫，我们就反抗，而且要一反到底。
    敌人挑衅，我们就回击，而且要加倍地回击。
    敌人搞法西斯法令，我们就要采取各种斗争形式，同敌人作斗争。
    敌人搞非法审讯，我们就要把敌人的法庭变为揭露英帝国主义的讲坛，对英帝国主义进行人民的正义的审判。
    敌人搞政治欺骗，我们就坚决揭露，坚决发动群众控诉英帝国主义的血腥罪行，普遍地、深入地开展仇视、鄙视、蔑视英帝国主义的群众运动，做到家喻户晓。
    敌人禁止宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想，我们一定要大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想，使敌人在伟大的毛泽东思想面前发抖！
    敌人在磨刀，我们也要磨刀。对于英帝国主义的新的威胁和新的挑衅，我港九爱国同胞是要认真对付的。我们一定要对英帝国主义一百多年来侵略中国的滔天罪行，霸占香港、侵吞九龙、攫取新界的滔天罪行，进行彻底的清算。我港九爱国同胞要做好一切准备，掀起一个反英抗暴斗争的新高潮，向敌人展开更强大的反击。全国的工人、农民、人民解放军战士和一切革命群众，都要做好充分的准备，用实际行动来支援香港同胞的斗争。
    港九爱国同胞们，让我们更加紧密地团结起来，坚决斗争，一定要把英帝国主义这只纸老虎戳它个稀巴烂！
