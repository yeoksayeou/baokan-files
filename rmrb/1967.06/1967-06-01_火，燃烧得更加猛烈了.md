The fire of the armed struggle of the Thai people is burning more intensely.

Recently, the Thai people's armed forces achieved a victory in a counter-"encirclement" battle in Nakhon Phanom Province. The Hmong people in Chiang Rai Province in the north have also risen up in rebellion, giving the reactionary military and police a severe beating. These are two powerful signals indicating that the armed forces of the Thai people are growing stronger and developing, and the situation of armed struggle is becoming better and better.

In order to prevent Thailand from becoming a "second Vietnam," the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, the Thanom-Praphat clique, have recently repeatedly dispatched large numbers of troops to "sweep" and "encircle" the Thai people's armed forces. However, they are completely helpless in the face of the brave and tenacious Thai people's armed forces.

The armed struggle between counter-revolutionary forces and revolutionary forces will, for a considerable period, repeatedly take the form of "encirclement" and counter-"encirclement." The enemy always tries to rely on its superior forces to surround and "exterminate" the relatively weaker people's armed forces. However, as long as the people's armed forces use flexible and mobile strategies and tactics to break the enemy's "encirclement," annihilate the enemy's fighting forces, and continuously grow and develop their own forces, they can gradually change the balance of power between the enemy and themselves.

Of course, today's Thai reactionaries have more than ten thousand mercenary troops, as well as various modern weapons supplied by U.S. imperialism. However, they lack the support of the people. This is their most fatal weakness. Chairman Mao said: "The balance of forces is not only a comparison of military and economic strength, but also a comparison of manpower and popular support." The Thai people's armed forces are gaining the support of an increasingly broad mass of people. As long as they fully mobilize and highly utilize the strength of tens of millions of people to fight against the enemy, they will definitely be able to smash the enemy's "encirclement," achieve one victory after another, and thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

### 火，燃烧得更加猛烈了

    火，燃烧得更加猛烈了
    泰国人民武装斗争的烽火燃烧得更加猛烈了。
    最近，泰国人民武装在那空拍侬府的一次反“围剿”中打了一个胜仗。北部清莱府的苗族人民也揭竿而起，给了反动军警一顿狠揍。这是两个有力的信号，说明泰国人民武装力量日益壮大发展，武装斗争的形势越来越好。
    美帝国主义和它的走狗他侬—巴博集团，为了防止泰国成为“第二个南越”，最近一再出动大批兵力对泰国人民武装进行“扫荡”和“围剿”。但是，他们在英勇顽强的泰国人民武装面前，完全无能为力。
    反革命势力和革命力量之间的武装斗争，在相当长的时期内，总是反复采取“围剿”和反“围剿”的形式。敌人总是想要依靠它的优势兵力，把比较弱小的人民武装包围而“剿灭”之。而人民武装，只要运用机动灵活的战略战术，打破敌人的“围剿”，歼灭敌人的有生力量，不断壮大发展自己的力量，建立和巩固革命根据地，就能逐步改变敌我力量的对比。
    当然，今天泰国反动派拥有十多万雇佣军队，还有美帝国主义供应的各种各样新式武器。但是，他们没有人民的支持。这是他们最致命的弱点。毛主席说：“力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。”泰国人民武装正在得到越来越广大的人民的拥护。他们只要充分动员和高度发挥千百万人民群众的力量，去同敌人进行斗争，就一定能够粉碎敌人的“围剿”，取得一个又一个的胜利，彻底打败美帝国主义和它的走狗。
