In the face of the sudden large-scale armed aggression launched by the U.S.-Israeli aggressors and the pressure exerted by the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union on the Arab countries, the governments of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan have been forced to accept the United Nations Security Council's "ceasefire resolution." However, the U.S. imperialists' lackey, Israel, is still continuing its massive attacks on Syria under the cover of the UN "ceasefire resolution." The struggle of the Arab peoples against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is at a critical juncture.

The Arab peoples' struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has suffered only a temporary setback. The flames of struggle have not been extinguished and will not be extinguished.

Since the U.S. and Israel launched their aggression, a widespread anti-U.S. struggle has surged across the Arab world, demonstrating the unprecedented awakening of the Arab peoples. Although a "ceasefire" has been announced, the peoples of the Arab countries are still indignant and continue to strike back at U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various ways, determined to fight the aggressors to the end.

For many years, the Arab peoples have been waging a heroic struggle to win and defend their national independence. Despite repeated setbacks, they have achieved great victories. The defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the 1950 "Three-Power Declaration" by the U.S., Britain, and France interfering in Arab affairs, did not stop the Arab national liberation struggle. The establishment of the Baghdad Pact in 1955, the temporary arrogance of imperialism, did not deter the Arab peoples from pressing forward. In 1956, when imperialism launched the Suez Canal aggression, the Arab peoples united to give a resolute rebuff to the imperialist aggressors. In 1957, when imperialism plotted to invade Syria, and in 1958, when U.S. imperialism directly intervened in Lebanon and Iraq, the Arab peoples were not intimidated. The facts prove that the great Arab peoples possess an indomitable fighting spirit. Temporary setbacks only serve to further inspire their resolve.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "Struggle, failure, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people." This is a law of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people's revolution has followed this law. The national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have followed this law. The Arab peoples' struggle against imperialism and its lackeys will inevitably follow this law.

Throughout the Middle East events, especially in the face of the Arab peoples' just war of resistance against aggression, all political forces in the world have been put to the test. The imperialists led by the United States, the Soviet modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries have spared no effort to plot, encourage, and support Israel's aggression and suppress the Arab peoples' anti-aggression struggle. The Chinese people and the people of the world have stood firmly on the side of the Arab peoples, thoroughly exposing the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, and fully supporting the Arab peoples' anti-aggression struggle. The two camps are clearly distinct. This fact has greatly enlightened the Arab peoples, deeply educated them, and enabled them to further see who the treacherous and evil enemy is and who the loyal and reliable comrades are.

The ugly face of U.S. imperialism has been fully exposed. The facts vividly show that U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit behind this aggression, the arch-criminal suppressing the Arab peoples, the biggest aggressor promoting neo-colonialism in the Arab world, and the number one enemy of the one hundred million Arab peoples.

The aggressive face of British imperialism has also been fully exposed. Britain, in collusion with the United States, instigated and supported Israel's armed attacks on the Arab countries and used its cunning political maneuvers to pressure the Arab countries. This declining and decaying old imperialist power, in order to maintain its shaky colonial position in Asia and Africa, has shown extreme madness in pursuing neo-colonialism.

In this Middle East event, French imperialism has claimed "neutrality," but in reality, it is also engaging in "big power" politics with the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, standing on the side of the U.S.-Israeli aggressors.

One of the major lessons the Arab peoples have learned from this Middle East event is gradually recognizing the treacherous and poisonous true face of the Soviet revisionist clique. Israel's armed aggression is essentially a joint plot by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to launch a savage attack on the Arab peoples, and it is also a political trap set by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to harm the Arab countries. Look! The Soviet revisionist clique, on the one hand, "guarantees" that Israel will not attack, and on the other hand, colludes with the United States to incite Israel to launch a surprise attack, catching the Arab countries off guard. Today, it expresses "support" for the Arab peoples, and tomorrow, it makes backroom deals with the United States to pass the so-called "ceasefire" resolution in the United Nations Security Council, betraying the Arab peoples. It publicly issues statements and notes, "condemning" Israel, but secretly colludes with Israel. After Israel controlled the Strait of Tiran, the first ship to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba was a Soviet ship. The Soviet revisionist clique is a two-faced, big liar, a traitor who betrays the Arab peoples, and a butcher who, in collusion with U.S. and British imperialism, suppresses the Arab peoples' anti-aggression struggle.

The Arab peoples' struggle against imperialist aggression is a long-term struggle. From a long-term perspective, from an essential perspective, the true strength lies with the Arab peoples. Whether it is U.S. imperialism, British imperialism, Soviet revisionism, or Israel, they are all paper tigers. Israel, with the help of U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, has armed itself and occupied some territories of the Arab countries. This is only a temporary phenomenon. The Arab peoples will ultimately liberate all the territories occupied by imperialism and its lackeys. The debt that imperialism owes the Arab peoples will surely be settled. No force in the world can prevent the Arab peoples from exercising this sacred right!

The current world situation is full of revolutionary fervor. Anti-U.S. struggles are flourishing around the world. The heroic Vietnamese people have demonstrated the boundless power of people's war, driving nearly five hundred thousand U.S. aggressors into a state of panic. In the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the flames of anti-imperialist revolution are burning more fiercely, and people's awareness has reached unprecedented heights. The imperialist bloc is heading towards disintegration. The modern revisionist bloc is also facing numerous difficulties. The world situation is extremely unfavorable for imperialism but favorable for the revolutionary peoples of all countries and for the Arab peoples in their struggle against aggression. No matter how desperately the imperialists led by the United States struggle, or how shamelessly the Soviet modern revisionists betray, they cannot change the overall situation of the world. The twists and turns that the Arab peoples encounter in their anti-imperialist struggle will not stop them from moving forward.

"The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." The Arab peoples are the creators of Arab history. The Arab lands will never allow imperialism and its lackeys to trample and desecrate them. As long as the one hundred million Arab peoples raise their awareness, adopt correct policies, and persevere in struggle, they will surely be able to drive out all the old and new colonialists led by the United States and annihilate all the aggressors!

Arab peoples, unite and persevere, engage in long-term, fiery struggles! Seven hundred million Chinese people support you, and revolutionary peoples around the world support you. The final victory will surely belong to the heroic Arab peoples!

### 阿拉伯人民团结起来再接再厉，同帝国主义斗争到底！

    阿拉伯人民团结起来再接再厉，同帝国主义斗争到底！
    在美以侵略者突然发动大规模的武装侵略，美英苏又串通一气对阿拉伯国家施加压力的情况下，阿联、叙利亚和约旦政府已被迫宣布接受联合国安理会的“停火决议”。但是，美帝国主义的走狗以色列，依靠联合国“停火决议”为掩护，还在对叙利亚继续大举进攻。阿拉伯各国人民反抗美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，正处在一个紧要的关头。
    阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，只是遭到了一次暂时的挫折。斗争的火焰并没有熄灭，也不会熄灭。
    自从美以发动侵略战争以后，阿拉伯世界就兴起一个广泛的群众性的反美斗争浪潮，表现了阿拉伯人民的空前觉醒。现在，虽然宣布了“停火”，但阿拉伯各国人民群情激昂，继续用各种方式打击美帝国主义及其走狗，决心同侵略者斗争到底。
    多少年来，阿拉伯人民为了争取和维护民族独立，一直进行着英勇的斗争。他们的斗争，尽管多次遭受挫折，但仍然取得了很大的胜利。一九四八年阿拉伯—以色列战争的失利，一九五○年美英法合伙干涉阿拉伯事务的“三国宣言”，并未能阻止阿拉伯民族解放斗争的发展。一九五五年巴格达军事条约集团成立，帝国主义嚣张一时，阿拉伯人民却继续奋勇前进。一九五六年帝国主义发动苏伊士运河的侵略战争，阿拉伯人民团结起来，给帝国主义侵略者以坚决的反击。一九五七年帝国主义策划侵略叙利亚的阴谋，一九五八年美帝国主义直接出兵黎巴嫩，武装干涉伊拉克革命，都没有吓倒阿拉伯人民。事实证明，伟大的阿拉伯人民具有不屈不挠的斗争精神，暂时的挫折，只是更加激励了他们的斗志。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”。这是一条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的定律。中国人民的革命依照了这条定律。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放斗争依照了这条定律。阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，也必然要依照这条定律。
    在中东事件的整个过程中，特别是在阿拉伯人民反侵略的正义战争面前，世界上一切政治力量都经受了检验。以美国为首的帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，千方百计地策划、鼓励以色列的侵略，镇压阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争。中国人民和全世界人民，则坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，彻底揭露美英苏的反革命大阴谋，全力支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争。两个营垒，泾渭分明。这个事实，大大擦亮了阿拉伯人民的眼睛，深刻地教育了阿拉伯人民，使他们进一步认清谁是阴险凶恶的敌人，谁是忠实可靠的战友。
    美帝国主义的狰狞面目彻底地暴露出来了。活生生的事实证明，美帝国主义是制造这次侵略战争的罪魁，是镇压阿拉伯人民的元凶，是在阿拉伯世界推行新殖民主义的最大的侵略者，是一亿阿拉伯人民不共戴天的头号敌人。
    英帝国主义的侵略面目也彻底地暴露出来了。英国同美国共同策动和支持以色列向阿拉伯国家发动的武装进攻，并大肆玩弄其老奸巨滑的政治手腕，向阿拉伯国家施加压力。这个衰败没落的老牌帝国主义，为了维持它在亚非的风雨飘摇的殖民地位，推行新殖民主义，表现了极大的疯狂性。
    法帝国主义在这次事件中标榜“中立”，但实际上它也是同美英苏一起搞“大国”强权政治，也是站在美以侵略者一边的。
    在这次中东事件中，阿拉伯人民得到的一个重大的教训，就是逐步地认清了苏修集团这个假朋友的阴险毒辣的真面目。以色列的武装侵略，实质上是美苏合谋向阿拉伯人民举行的一次猖狂进攻，也是美苏串通一气安排的一个坑害阿拉伯国家的政治圈套。看吧！苏修集团一边“保证”以色列不会进攻，一边同美国互相勾结，怂恿以色列发动突然袭击，使阿拉伯国家措手不及。它今天表示“支持”阿拉伯人民，明天就同美国大做幕后交易，在联合国安理会炮制所谓“停火”决议，对阿拉伯人民实行大叛卖。它明里是左一个声明，右一个照会，“谴责”以色列，暗里却同以色列勾勾搭搭。当以色列控制了蒂朗海峡以后，第一艘通过亚喀巴湾的船只就是苏联的。苏修集团是两面三刀的大骗子，是出卖阿拉伯人民的大叛徒，是伙同美英帝国主义镇压阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的刽子手。　
    阿拉伯人民反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争，是长期的斗争。从长远的观点看，从本质上看，真正有力量的是阿拉伯人民。什么美帝，什么英帝，什么苏修，什么以色列，都是纸老虎。以色列靠着美英帝国主义和苏修的帮助，武装占领了阿拉伯国家的一些领土，这只是暂时的现象。阿拉伯人民终究要解放被帝国主义和它的走狗所强占的全部领土。帝国主义对阿拉伯人民所欠下的债，总是要清算的。世界上任何力量都阻止不了阿拉伯人民行使这一神圣的权利！
    当前世界，是一片大好的革命形势。世界各地反美斗争正在蓬勃开展。英勇的越南人民发挥了人民战争的无限威力，把近五十万美国侵略军打得焦头烂额。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲广大地区，反帝革命的怒火越烧越旺，人民觉悟空前提高。帝国主义集团正在走向四分五裂。现代修正主义集团也是困难重重。世界形势十分不利于帝国主义，而有利于各国革命人民，有利于阿拉伯人民坚持反侵略斗争。不管以美国为首的帝国主义进行多么疯狂的挣扎，苏联现代修正主义进行多么无耻的叛卖活动，都改变不了世界形势的这个大局。阿拉伯人民在自己的反帝斗争的道路上遇到的某些曲折，绝不能阻挡他们继续前进。
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”阿拉伯人民是阿拉伯历史的创造者。阿拉伯的大地，绝不容许帝国主义及其走狗践踏和蹂躏。只要一亿阿拉伯人民提高觉悟，采取正确的政策，坚持斗争，就一定能够把以美国为首的新老殖民主义统统赶走，把侵略强盗统统消灭干净！
    阿拉伯人民，团结起来，再接再厉，投入长期的、火热的斗争吧！七亿中国人民支持着你们，全世界革命人民支持着你们。最后胜利一定属于英勇的阿伯拉人民！
