Yemeni newspaper *Al-Thawra* published an article on the 16th stating: "If one believes that the United Nations Security Council can solve the Middle East problem, that is extremely foolish. Because the United Nations is controlled by Western colonialism led by the United States. The United Nations has become a tool for colonialists to oppose the Arab cause." The article said: "We Arab people will never forget that Israel's aggression against Arab countries was supported by American and British aircraft. No one will forget the dirty crimes committed by the United States against the Arab people. The people of the world all call Johnson a war criminal."

The same day, the newspaper published an editorial stating: "The existence of Israel is the result of American imperialist expansion. The Arab people must currently engage in a struggle against the ugly face of colonialism."

The editorial said, "Facing such realities, the Arab people must unite their ranks, take up arms, and prepare for battle, eliminate the bases of colonialism, and achieve victory."

    也门报纸表示不相信联合国能解决中东问题
    阿拉伯人民必须拿起武器准备战斗
    新华社萨那十七日电  也门《革命报》十六日发表文章说：如果相信联合国安全理事会能够解决中东问题，那是极为愚蠢的。因为“联合国被以美国为首的西方殖民主义所控制。联合国成了殖民主义者反对阿拉伯事业的工具”。文章说：“我们阿拉伯人民决不会忘记，以色列对阿拉伯国家发动的侵略，靠的是美国和英国的飞机。”“没有人会忘记美国对阿拉伯人民所犯下的肮脏罪行。全世界人民都把约翰逊叫做战争罪犯。”
    这家报纸同一天发表社论指出：以色列的存在，是美帝国主义扩张的结果。阿拉伯人民当前必须进行反对面目狰狞的殖民主义的斗争。
    社论说，面对这样的实际，阿拉伯人民必须团结自己的队伍，拿起武器准备战斗，清除殖民主义的基地，并赢得胜利。
