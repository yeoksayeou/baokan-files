The proletarian revolutionary forces at the Datong Locomotive Factory, with the assistance of the propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism. They have directed their struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, achieving a bottom-up unity by workshop and department. This has consolidated and developed the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The factory has completed its state plan ahead of schedule or overfulfilled it for the months of February, March, April, and May, achieving a double harvest of revolution and production.

The revolutionary organization "January 31" at the Datong Locomotive Factory, after winning the power struggle at the end of January, did not do enough to win over and unite the masses who had been deceived within the conservative organizations. Some people lacked understanding of the need for a great alliance throughout the factory. A few people in the conservative organizations took advantage of this to spread rumors and slander, attempting to topple the revolutionary forces. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party fanned the flames of evil, trying to seize power back from the proletarian revolutionary forces. The propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in response to this situation, first stood firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces, helping them to rectify their mistakes and study Chairman Mao's works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," the "Three Articles," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They armed the proletarian revolutionary forces with ideological weapons. The comrades in the proletarian revolutionary forces realized that, in dealing with comrades who have been deceived and made mistakes, they must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "to clarify thoughts and unite comrades," in order to continuously expand the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces. At the same time, only by achieving a great alliance of revolution, especially a bottom-up unity by workshop and department, can they concentrate their firepower to overthrow and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

After arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary forces in this factory firmly grasped the key issue of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, directing their struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In the great criticism of the revolution, they united the majority of the masses and promoted the great alliance of the revolution. Shortly after the proletarian revolutionary forces seized power, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party incited a part of the deceived masses to slander the People's Liberation Army for "supporting a hodgepodge," directly pointing the spearhead at the army. The proletarian revolutionary forces used the methods of great exposure, great debate, and great criticism to smash this countercurrent. Then, this handful of people directed the deceived masses not to go to work, attempting to sabotage production and the Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary forces, on the one hand, shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, and on the other hand, vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution and promote production" within the factory, educating the deceived masses to grasp revolution and promote production, thus foiling another plot by this handful of people. Later, the proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses smashed the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who directed their spearhead at the revolutionary leading cadres who had come forward, attempting to sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and collude with class enemies in society to operate conservative organizations and plot a counter-coup. Through these several sharp and intense class struggles, the deceived masses woke up one after another, turned back to strike, and exposed the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At this time, the factory held successive meetings to expose, criticize, and struggle against the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. A common struggle target promoted the gradual unity of the broad revolutionary masses, and some conservative organizations dissolved themselves as the masses woke up one after another, and the deceived masses stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Now, the Datong Locomotive Factory has established a unified revolutionary organization—the Red Combat Corps of Mao Zedong Thought. More than 80% of the revolutionary workers in the entire factory have joined this revolutionary organization. Combat brigades have been established in each workshop and department, combat teams in each work section, and combat squads in each work group. Recently, the entire factory held a representative meeting of revolutionary organizations and elected to establish the revolutionary provisional power organ—the Datong Locomotive Factory Revolutionary Committee.

    把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    在大批判中实现革命的大联合
    大同机车厂革命派团结群众大多数，百分之八十以上革命职工参加统一的革命组织
    据新华社太原五日电　大同机车工厂的无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，高举革命的批判大旗，把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，实现了自下而上的按车间、按部门的大联合，巩固和发展了革命的“三结合”。这个厂二、三、四、五月份都提前或超额完成了国家计划，夺得了革命、生产双丰收。
    大同机车工厂的革命组织“一·三一”，一月底取得夺权斗争的胜利以后，开始对于保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众，争取和团结工作做得不够；对于全厂实现大联合，有些人思想认识不足。保守组织中的少数人就趁机造谣诬蔑，企图攻垮革命派。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派又煽阴风，点邪火，企图把权从无产阶级革命派手里反夺回去。人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队针对这种情况，首先旗帜鲜明地站在无产阶级革命派一边，帮助他们整风，帮助他们学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、“老三篇”、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，从思想上武装无产阶级革命派。无产阶级革命派同志认识到：对待受蒙蔽的、犯过错误的同志，一定要按照毛主席的教导去做，“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”，以达到不断壮大无产阶级革命派队伍的目的；同时，只有实现革命的大联合，特别是按车间、按部门的大联合，才能集中火力把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗臭。
    这个工厂的无产阶级革命派，用毛泽东思想武装起来以后，就紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，高举革命的批判旗帜，把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在革命的大批判中，团结群众的大多数，促进革命的大联合。在无产阶级革命派刚刚夺权之后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就挑动一部分受蒙蔽的群众，诬蔑人民解放军“支持了大杂烩”，把矛头直接指向解放军。无产阶级革命派采取大揭露、大辩论、大批判的方法，粉碎了这一股逆流。接着，这一小撮人又指使受蒙蔽的群众不上班，妄图破坏生产，破坏文化大革命。无产阶级革命派一方面挑起革命、生产两副重担，同时，在厂内大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，教育受欺骗的群众抓革命，促生产，又一次挫败了一小撮人的阴谋。后来，无产阶级革命派和革命群众，又接连粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把矛头指向站出来的革命领导干部，妄图破坏革命的“三结合”和勾结社会上的阶级敌人，操纵保守组织，妄图进行反夺权的阴谋。经过这几次尖锐的激烈的阶级斗争，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉悟过来，狠杀回马枪，揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。这时，厂里连续召开大会，揭发、批判、斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。共同的斗争目标促使广大革命群众逐步联合起来，一些保守组织在群众纷纷觉悟的情况下自行解散了，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    现在，大同机车工厂已经成立了统一的革命组织——毛泽东思想红色战斗兵团，全厂百分之八十几的革命职工都参加了这个革命组织，各车间、部门成立了战斗分团，工段成立了战斗队，作业小组成立了战斗小组。不久前，全厂召开革命组织代表会议，选举成立了革命的临时权力机构——大同机车工厂革命委员会。
