The workers and people from various sectors in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories have formed an anti-persecution struggle army, continuing to launch attacks against the British authorities in Hong Kong for their bloody suppression of the Hong Kong people. They are organizing and taking action, strengthening unity, and engaging in a tenacious struggle.

On the morning of the 30th, 1,000 Chinese workers from the Hong Kong British "Waterworks Department" simultaneously stopped work for two hours in Hong Kong and Kowloon. During the stoppage, waterworks workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon held meetings inside the "Waterworks Factory" to denounce the fascist bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. They sternly warned the Hong Kong British authorities: If you continue to be obstinate and persist in opposing the 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, daring to ignore our solemn demands, we waterworks workers will take further action.

The Hong Kong British authorities are terrified of the just struggle of the waterworks workers and hurriedly brought out a set of so-called "Civil Service Conduct and Discipline" regulations to threaten the workers. The waterworks workers stood united, broke through numerous obstacles, and despite the Hong Kong British authorities' intimidation, insisted on stopping work as originally planned, achieving victory.

On the 29th, more than 3,000 Shanghai garment industry workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon also stopped work for a day to protest against the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. The workers pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities had organized, planned, and premeditated the "May 6," "May 11," and "May 22" massacres, using brutal beatings, illegal arrests, illegal kidnappings, and unreasonable sentencing—fascist methods—to savagely persecute and oppress our compatriots, plunging Hong Kong and Kowloon into a white terror. They solemnly declared that the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately and unconditionally accept all five demands of our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the four demands of the people of various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon; otherwise, the Hong Kong British authorities will not have a good end.

On the evening of the 29th, all workers at the Kowloon Whampoa Dockyard refused to work the night shift. The workers said, "We fear neither heaven nor earth. No matter how many broken warships the British government brings in, they cannot intimidate the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. British imperialism is just a paper tiger, nothing to be afraid of." They emphasized: The heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong must be thoroughly settled and must receive the punishment they deserve.

In recent days, the anti-British atrocities wave has swept across all of Hong Kong. Farmers in the New Territories have also taken action. On the morning of the 30th, patriotic compatriots in the Tai Po district of the New Territories pasted protest slogans all over the Hong Kong British "police post" and notice boards in Tai Po Market to protest against the fascist bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and distributed anti-atrocity leaflets. Local farmers wrote large-character slogans on the roads of Tai Po's 17 streets and various villages: "The Chinese people cannot be insulted!" "Protest against the bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Blood for blood!"

On the evening of the 29th, the entire village of Lung Wei and Lau Chi Tin in the Tai Po district held denunciation meetings for all villagers. The farmers were indignant about the bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and unanimously expressed their resolute support for the five solemn demands of our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the four demands of the people of various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They said, "We must, together with all the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, demand blood debt from the Hong Kong British authorities and carry the anti-persecution struggle through to the end."

The compatriots in the Hong Kong publishing industry, in the face of the Hong Kong British fascist military police, stood tall and unyielding, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    中国人民不可侮！抗议港英当局血腥暴行！
    香港农民奋起投入反迫害斗争
    水务、缝衣、船坞工人和各界同胞组成抗暴大军，进行顽强斗争
    新华社香港三十一日电　港九、新界各业工人、各界同胞组成的反迫害斗争大军，继续向血腥镇压香港同胞的港英当局发动冲击，他们纷纷组织起来，行动起来，加强团结，进行顽强不屈的斗争。
    三十日上午，港英“水务局”一千名中国工人，在香港和九龙同时进行了两个小时的停工斗争。在停工时间内，港九水务工人分别在“水务局工厂”内举行了控诉港英当局法西斯血腥暴行的大会，严厉警告港英当局：如果你们仍然冥顽不灵，继续与七亿中国人民为敌，继续与港九中国同胞为敌，胆敢无视我们的严正要求，我们水务工人将进一步行动起来。
    港英当局对于水务工人的正义斗争怕得要死，慌忙搬出一套什么“公务员行为及纪律”的“奉公守则”，对工人进行威胁。水务工人团结一致，冲破重重阻挠，不顾港英当局的恐吓，坚持按原计划停工，取得了胜利。
    二十九日，港九三千多名上海缝衣业工人也停工一天抗议港英当局的暴行。工人们指出，港英当局有组织、有计划、有预谋地炮制了“五·六”、“五·一一”和“五·二二”血案，使用残酷殴打、非法拘捕、非法绑架和无理判刑等法西斯手段，疯狂地摧残和迫害我同胞，使港九陷入一片白色恐怖。他们严正指出，港英当局必须迅速无条件地全部接受我国外交部的五项要求和港九各界同胞的四项要求，否则，港英当局决不会有好下场。
    九龙黄埔船坞工人二十九日晚全部拒绝开夜工。工人们说，我们天不怕，地不怕，不管英国政府调来多少破军舰，绝对吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，英帝国主义不过是纸老虎，没有什么了不起。他们强调指出：英帝国主义在香港犯下的滔天罪行一定要彻底的清算，一定要受到应有的惩罚。
    这几天，反对港英当局迫害的抗暴怒潮席卷全香港，郊区新界农民也已行动起来。新界大埔区爱国同胞为抗议港英当局的法西斯血腥暴行，三十日早晨在大埔墟港英的“警岗”和告示牌上贴满了抗议标语，并散发抗暴传单。当地农民在大埔的十七条街和各村的马路上用油漆写上大字标语：“中国人民不可侮！”“抗议港英血腥暴行！”“血债血偿！”
    二十九日晚上，大埔区龙尾村、芦慈田村分别举行了全体村民声讨大会，农民们对港英当局的血腥暴行无不咬牙切齿，一致表示坚决支持我国外交部的五项严正要求和港九各界同胞的四项要求。他们说，一定要和全港九同胞一道，向港英当局讨还血债，把反迫害斗争进行到底。
