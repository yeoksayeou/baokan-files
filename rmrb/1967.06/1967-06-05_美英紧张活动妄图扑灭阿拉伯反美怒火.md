The U.S. and British imperialists are engaged in frantic activities, plotting to take collective measures to exert pressure on Arab countries from political, military, and economic angles, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of Arab people's anti-American struggle.

To break through the blockade imposed by the United Arab Republic (UAR) on the Gulf of Aqaba, the U.S. government announced on June 2 that it is "consulting with other maritime nations" to issue a declaration stating that the Gulf of Aqaba must be an "international waterway" with "free passage." The British government also declared on May 31 that it is in negotiations with "maritime nations of the world" for the same purpose.

The United Press International reported from Washington that, "The proposed declaration by maritime nations is only the first step in a three-step plan agreed upon by the U.S. and Britain. The aim of this plan is to gradually increase pressure on UAR President Nasser if he refuses to lift the blockade he has declared." The report added that the other two steps are: "Maritime nations will take various measures to exert specific political, economic, and financial pressure on Egypt (i.e., UAR) and other countries"; "Establish an international naval task force to ensure free passage through the Straits of Tiran into the Gulf of Aqaba."

The U.S. imperialists are particularly intensifying military threats against Arab countries.

The U.S. and Britain have already dispatched large fleets to the Middle East. They are also rallying other countries to form an "international naval task force." Senator McCarthy revealed that on June 1, U.S. Vice President Humphrey, Secretary of State Rusk, and Secretary of Defense McNamara proposed in a secret session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee "to use a joint naval force to break through the blockade."

At the same time, U.S. imperialism is colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to continue its conspiratorial activities through the United Nations.

To buy more time for secret dealings with the Soviet revisionists, the U.S. proposed a resolution on May 31 at the UN Security Council, calling for "all parties to exercise special restraint," to allow a "breathing space" for "immediate international diplomatic activities."

This so-called "international diplomatic activity" includes the aforementioned U.S. and British efforts to exert pressure on Arab countries from political, military, and economic angles. The U.S. and British imperialists are also attempting to strengthen the UN's intervention in the Middle East, even planning to send another form of UN forces after the "UN Emergency Force" was forced to withdraw.

    美英紧张活动妄图扑灭阿拉伯反美怒火
    据新华社三日讯  美英帝国主义正在进行紧张的活动，策划采取集体措施，从政治、军事和经济各个方面，对阿拉伯国家施加压力，阴谋扑灭阿拉伯人民反美斗争的怒火。
    为了冲破阿联对亚喀巴湾的封锁，美国政府在二日宣布，美国正在“同其他海运国家进行磋商”，准备发表一项宣言，宣称亚喀巴湾必须是一条得以“自由通过”的“国际航道”。英国政府在五月三十一日也声称，英国正在同“世界海运国家”进行这样的谈判。
    合众国际社华盛顿消息说，“拟议中的由海运国家发表宣言，不过是美英一致同意的一个三步骤方案中的第一个步骤。这个方案的目的是要逐渐增加对阿联总统纳赛尔的压力，如果他拒绝取消他所宣布的封锁的话”。消息还说，另外两个步骤是：由“海运国家”采取“各种手段，对埃及（即阿联）和其他国家施加具体的政治、经济和财政压力”；“建立一支国际海军特混部队，来保证经过蒂朗海峡进入亚喀巴湾的通行自由”。
    美帝国主义特别在加紧对阿拉伯国家实行武力威胁。
    美国和英国已经把大批军舰调集到中东地区。它们还要纠集其他国家，来组成一支“国际海军特混部队”。美国参议员麦卡锡透露，美国副总统汉弗莱、国务卿腊斯克和国防部长麦克纳马拉一日在参议院外交委员会秘密会议上，提出了“关于用一支联合海军力量来硬冲封锁的建议”。
    同时，美帝国主义勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，正在继续通过联合国来进行阴谋活动。
    美国为了争取更多时间，便于同苏修大搞幕后的秘密交易，五月三十一日在联合国安全理事会上提出一项提案，要“有关各方特别克制”，使得有“一个喘息时间”，以便“立即进行国际外交活动”。
    这种所谓“国际外交活动”，就是包括上述美英从政治、军事和经济各方面对阿拉伯国家施加压力的种种活动。美英帝国主义还在企图加强联合国干涉中东的权力，甚至在“联合国紧急部队”被迫撤走以后，再派遣另外一种形式的联合国部队进去。
