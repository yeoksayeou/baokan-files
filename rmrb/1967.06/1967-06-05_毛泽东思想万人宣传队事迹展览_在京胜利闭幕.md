The exhibition on the deeds of the People's Liberation Army's "Mao Zedong Thought Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team" successfully concluded in Beijing today after welcoming over 2.9 million domestic and international visitors.

This exhibition, which introduced the deeds of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region in propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the Tangshan earthquake-stricken area, provided a profound education for the broad masses of viewers.

Over the course of seven months, more than 100,000 viewers wrote enthusiastic comments in over 400 guest books, praising the exhibition as a grand classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought, a living model for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and a training ground for propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically sang the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, of the great leader Chairman Mao, and of the People's Liberation Army, which was personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin.

This exhibition greatly aroused the consciousness and sense of responsibility of the broad masses of viewers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone recognized that propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most fundamental service to the people and is the lifelong battle duty of revolutionaries, and they resolved to be lifelong propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

The basic experiences of the Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team in propagating Mao Zedong Thought—using Chairman Mao's words to propagate to the masses has the greatest power; setting an example according to Chairman Mao's teachings has the deepest influence; and starting from class education to propagate has the best effect—provided great inspiration to the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses. They unanimously praised the PLA as an excellent example of studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "This is the most precious spiritual wealth that the PLA has left for us." Many Red Guards who had visited the exhibition and left Beijing wrote letters to the exhibition, sharing their experiences and insights on using the three experiences to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, expressing their resolve to forever be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad cadres and soldiers fighting on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military training, and military control learned and applied these three experiences, receiving warm welcome from the broad leftist masses.

The exhibits of this exhibition have been replicated into more than 30 sets and will soon be on display in various places across the country.
