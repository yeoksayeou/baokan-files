Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible spiritual atomic bomb.

Chairman Mao pointed out as early as June 1958: "To make a few atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is entirely possible in ten years." Now, Chairman Mao's wise prediction and great call have been realized ahead of schedule. On June 17, 1967, our country successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb! This is another resounding victory song of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, and another glorious achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

This great victory of the successful detonation of the hydrogen bomb has once again greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. It has further broken the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, causing their nuclear blackmail policy to completely collapse. This is a great support and encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and revolutionary people all over the world who are bravely fighting. This is a heavy blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

The successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb once again proves that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb. The heroic Chinese people, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, have blazed a trail in developing nuclear weapons and dared to scale peaks that no one has ever climbed before. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions. We must resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and push the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units to new heights. We must seize the revolution and promote production, carry forward the spirit of the proletarian revolution that dares to overcome difficulties. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought all over China and all over the world.

    毛泽东思想是战无不胜的精神原子弹
    黑龙江省革命委员会常委　范正美
    毛主席早在一九五八年六月就指出：搞一点原子弹、氢弹，我看有十年功夫完全可能。现在，毛主席的这个英明预言和伟大号召已经提前实现了，一九六七年六月十七日，我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想又一响彻云霄的凯歌，这是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的又一辉煌成果。
    这次氢弹爆炸成功的伟大胜利，又一次大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风，进一步打破了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义核垄断的地位，使它们的核讹诈政策全面破产了。这是对英勇斗争中的越南人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。这是对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的沉重打击，是对无产阶级革命派的巨大鼓舞。
    我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，再一次证明战无不胜的毛泽东思想是威力最大的精神原子弹。英雄的中国人民就是靠毛泽东思想闯出了一条自己发展核武器的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们一定要彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改推向新的高潮；一定要抓革命、促生产，发扬敢于克服困难的无产阶级革命精神。我们要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全中国，插遍全世界。
