Nasser Condemns U.S. and British Support for Israeli Aggression

He Says Soviet Government Insisted UAR Not to Fire First During Israeli Attack

CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) — Egyptian President Nasser condemned the imperialist support of the United States and Britain for Israel's aggression on the night of June 9. He said that American and British planes participated in the air raids on Egypt and Syria.

In recounting the course of Israel's aggressive war, he said: "On May 26, (U.S. President) Johnson sent a telegram through our ambassador in Washington, urging us to control ourselves and exercise restraint, not to fire first, otherwise we would face dangerous consequences. On the same night, the Soviet ambassador to Egypt had an emergency meeting with me at 3:30 a.m. and told me that the Soviet government insisted that we not fire first." Nasser then pointed out that under these circumstances, the Israeli army launched a surprise attack on Egypt on June 5, causing Egypt to suffer heavy losses.

Nasser made these remarks in a television broadcast.

He pointed out that from the Israeli air raids on all of Egypt's military and civilian airports, it could be seen that "the enemy relied on forces beyond its own to protect its airspace, so that it would not be subjected to any attacks from our side." He said that the enemy, with the support from elsewhere, attacked other Arab countries.

Nasser said that he "could not conceal the fact that Egypt has suffered a severe setback." He said that the Egyptian people should learn a lesson from this setback, which includes: eliminating imperialism to isolate Israel; fully utilizing Arab resources for the rights of the Arabs, which will be the main guarantee of Arab security; and strengthening the unity of the Arab people.

In his June 9 television broadcast, Nasser announced his decision to "resign from all official posts and not to engage in any political work."

After Nasser announced his resignation, the Egyptian public held demonstrations, condemning U.S. and British imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and chanting slogans such as "Homeland!" and "Give us weapons!"

At the same time, the Egyptian cabinet and the National Assembly passed a resolution urging Nasser to reconsider his resignation.

On June 10, the National Assembly held a special meeting. President Anwar Sadat read a letter from Nasser, in which Nasser announced his decision to continue serving as president.

    阿联总统谴责美英支持以色列侵略
    他谈到以色列突然袭击时说：苏联政府坚持要阿联不首先开火
    据新华社开罗十日电  阿联总统纳赛尔九日晚上谴责美、英帝国主义支持以色列进行侵略。他说，美国和英国的飞机参加了对阿联和叙利亚的空袭。
    他在追述以色列发动侵略战争的经过时说：“五月二十六日，（美国总统）约翰逊通过我们驻华盛顿的大使打电报来要我们控制自己和表现克制，不要首先开枪，否则我们将面临危险的后果。同一天夜里，苏联驻阿联大使在清晨三点三十分同我紧急会晤，并告诉我说，苏联政府坚持要求我们不要首先开火。”纳赛尔接着指出，在这种情况下，以色列军队在六月五日对阿联发动了突然袭击，使阿联遭受重大损失。
    纳赛尔是在一次电视广播中说这番话的。
    他指出，从以色列对阿联的所有军用和民用机场的空袭中就可看出，“敌人依靠了它本身力量以外的力量来保护它的领空，使它不致遭到我们方面的任何攻击。”他说，敌人利用来自别处的支持，攻击了其他阿拉伯国家。
    纳赛尔说，他“不能掩饰埃及遭到严重挫折的事实”。他说，阿联人民应当从这次挫折中得出教训，这包括：清除帝国主义，以便使以色列孤立；充分利用阿拉伯的资源为阿拉伯的权利服务，这将是阿拉伯安全的主要保证；阿拉伯人民加强团结。
    纳赛尔在九日的电视广播中宣布，他决定“放弃一切官职和不担任一切政治工作”。
    在纳赛尔宣布辞职以后，阿联公众曾举行示威游行，谴责美、英帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义，并且高呼“祖国！”“给我们武器！”等口号。
    同时，阿联内阁和国民议会通过决议，要求纳赛尔重新考虑他的辞职。
    六月十日，国民议会举行特别会议，议长萨达特宣读了纳赛尔给他的一封信，纳赛尔在信中宣布决定继续担任总统。
