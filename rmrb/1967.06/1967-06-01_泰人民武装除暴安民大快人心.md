According to a report from the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the Thai people's armed forces recently surrounded a village in Sakhon Nakhon Province. With the assistance of the local populace, they captured two notorious local tyrants and spies. At the request of the people, the armed forces held a public trial and executed these two criminals who had opposed the people. The actions of the people's armed forces in punishing the tyrants and spies were warmly welcomed by the populace, who saw more clearly the strength of the people's armed forces and thus supported them even more wholeheartedly.
