Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, Hong Kong Compatriots Fight Stronger and Stronger. They Struggle Resolutely with the Fascist Police in the Enemy's Prison and Bravely Defend the Red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the Shiny Mao Badges.

Hong Kong, June 1 (Xinhua) — In the "May 22" incident orchestrated by the Hong Kong British authorities, Hong Kong patriots who were illegally beaten and arrested by the Hong Kong British fascist police have, in the enemy's dark prisons, fought resolutely with great heroism to defend the boundless great Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined, fearless of sacrifice, and bravely struggle against the Hong Kong British fascist police.

The arrested patriots were already severely injured by the Hong Kong British "riot control squad" on the streets. When they were dragged onto the police cars, they continued to be brutally beaten. From the moment they were dragged onto the cars to the moment they reached the prison, the compatriots had to endure at least five or six brutal beatings from the Hong Kong British fascist police. However, they fear no violence, stand tall, and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, shouting "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" This terrified the fascist police.

In the prison, the Hong Kong British authorities' fascist police's persecution of the patriots is even more horrifying. The beasts beat the arrested compatriots with sticks, kick them with feet, and punch them with fists. They are extremely hostile towards Mao Zedong Thought and beat those carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" especially hard, making sure there are no visible injuries or blood. These criminals also fear that the patriots will recognize their brutal faces, so they maliciously use sacks to cover the compatriots and beat them in turns. Therefore, most of the arrested compatriots have internal injuries, and some are even fractured.

The brave arrested compatriots in the prison repeatedly recall Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person left, that person will continue to fight on." In the dark prison, they have fought resolutely against the enemy. Through the small holes in the prison, they tell their visiting relatives, "Please rest assured, we will all hold on!" "You know we did not plead guilty in the 'court'!" "We are not afraid of their beatings!" This is not ordinary language; it is the voice of steel-hard warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, bullets aimed at the Hong Kong British fascist criminals!

The patriots imprisoned by the Hong Kong British authorities, though all severely tortured, listen to Chairman Mao's words, care for each other, and help each other. They care more about their comrades than themselves. They also encourage their visiting relatives to continue the struggle resolutely. A very young female comrade, when seeing her mother, said, "I can endure it, don't worry about me. You must continue the struggle and carry on the anti-persecution struggle to the end!"

The executioners are terrified of Mao badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." As soon as they enter the prison, they order the compatriots to remove the Mao badges from their chests, shouting, "Remove them or we will beat you until you do." Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the compatriots. They resolutely reply, "We will not remove them even if you beat us to death!" Thus, several comrades were beaten unconscious on the spot. Some female fascist police also used the same brutal beating methods on female compatriots, even kicking their feet and lower bodies with their hard-soled shoes. However, our female compatriots always despise the enemy's "orders" and not one of them voluntarily removed the Mao badges.

What power makes these injured compatriots so strong? It is the support of the seven hundred million people of the great socialist motherland, the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and because they have Chairman Mao to rely on.

A worker, on May 22, stood up to protect his comrade, using his body to block the riot control squad's batons, resulting in severe injuries and arrest. This worker, who loves Chairman Mao dearly, under the fascist police's brutal beating and thorough body search, risked everything and vowed to defend a shiny Mao badge. This Mao badge inspired him to fight and gave him the strength to endure the enemy's severe torture. Later, he bravely and cleverly handed this extraordinary Mao badge to his comrades outside the prison. When the comrades received this extraordinary Mao badge, they couldn't help but shed tears of joy. They carefully stored this Mao badge.

The Hong Kong British authorities foolishly think they can suppress the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Hong Kong through bloody suppression. However, contrary to the enemy's wishes, the boundless Mao Zedong Thought is inspiring Hong Kong compatriots to fight bravely. To defend Mao Zedong Thought and the dignity of the Chinese nation, they vow to carry on the struggle against the persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities to the end, and will not retreat until they achieve complete victory.

To "Governor's House" to protest, representatives from various circles in Hong Kong loudly read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" outside the "Governor's House," determined to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and will not rest until victory is achieved!

    下定决心　不怕牺牲　排除万难　去争取胜利
    毛泽东思想武装的香港同胞越战越强
    他们在敌人的监牢里同港英法西斯警察坚决斗争，英勇地保卫红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和金光闪闪的毛主席像章
    新华社香港三十一日电　在港英当局一手制造的“五·二二”血案中，被港英法西斯警察非法殴打和无理逮捕的香港爱国同胞，在敌人暗无天日的监牢里，为保卫光焰无际的伟大的毛泽东思想，以大无畏的英雄气概，下定决心，不怕牺牲，英勇地同港英法西斯警察进行着坚决的斗争。
    被捕的爱国同胞，在街头本来就被港英“防暴队”打得遍体鳞伤，被拉上警车时又继续遭到灭绝人性的毒打。从被拉上车到监牢这短短的时间内，同胞们起码要遭受到港英法西斯警察的五、六次毒打。但是，他们不畏强暴，昂首挺胸，高唱毛主席语录歌，齐呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”把法西斯警察吓得心惊胆战。
    在监牢里，港英当局法西斯警察对爱国同胞的迫害，更是令人发指。野兽们对被捕同胞用棍击，用脚踹，用拳殴。他们对毛泽东思想极端仇视，对带有《毛主席语录》的同胞打得特别厉害，而且不让受害者有外伤、见血。这些暴徒还害怕爱国同胞认清他们凶残的面孔，就丧心病狂地用麻布袋包裹着同胞们轮番毒打。因此，被捕的同胞大部分都有内伤，有些被打得骨折。
    英勇的被捕同胞在监牢里不断重温毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”他们在黑牢中同敌人进行了坚决的斗争。他们通过监牢的小洞，对前来探望的亲人说，“请家里兄弟姊妹们放心，我们全体一定坚持下去！”“你们知道我们在‘法庭’上没有认罪吧！”“我们是不怕他们毒打的！”这不是普普通通的言语，这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头战士的声音，是射击港英法西斯暴徒的子弹！
    关在港英监牢中的爱国同胞虽然个个身受残酷的折磨，但是他们听毛主席的话，互相爱护，互相帮助，关心战友比关心自己为重。他们还鼓励前来探望的亲人一定要坚决斗争下去。一位年纪很轻的女青年见到自己的妈妈时说，“我顶得住，不要为我担心，你要坚持斗争，一定要把反迫害斗争进行到底！”
    刽子手们对毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》怕得要死，一进监狱就命令同胞们除下胸前的毛主席像章，叫嚷“不除就打到除。”毛主席是同胞们心中最红最红的红太阳，同胞们坚决地回答说：“打死都不除！”就这样，当场就有几位同胞被打得不能动弹。一些法西斯女警对女同胞也采取了同样残酷的毒打手段，甚至用她们的硬皮鞋猛踹女同胞的脚背，乱踢女同胞的下身。但是，我们的女同胞始终蔑视敌人的“命令”，没有一个自动除下毛主席像章的。
    是什么力量使这些身负重伤的同胞表现得如此坚强呢？是伟大的社会主义祖国七亿人民的支持，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是因为有毛主席他老人家撑腰。
    一位职工，在“五·二二”那天为了保护自己的战友，挺身而出，以自己的身体挡住“防暴队”的警棍，结果身受重伤而被捕。这位无限热爱毛主席的职工，在法西斯警察疯狂毒打和彻底搜身的情况下，豁出一切，誓死保卫一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章。这枚毛主席像章鼓舞着他去战斗，给了他巨大的力量去顶住敌人的严刑拷打。后来他又勇敢机智地把这枚毛主席像章交到狱外战友的手中。当战友们接到这枚不平凡的毛主席像章时，忍不住涌出了热泪。他们小心地把这枚毛主席像章珍藏起来。
    港英当局妄想以血腥镇压来遏制毛泽东思想在香港的传播，可是，同敌人的愿望相反，光焰无际的毛泽东思想正在激励着香港同胞奋勇战斗。为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了捍卫中华民族的尊严，他们誓把反对港英当局迫害的斗争进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
