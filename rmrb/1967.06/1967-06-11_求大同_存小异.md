Title: Seek Common Ground While Reserving Differences

Currently, regarding the issue of revolutionary unity, some people believe that unity is only possible if there is "unanimity of views." Otherwise, unity is not possible.

If unanimity of views is required in the general direction, this is completely correct and beyond doubt. However, requiring all revolutionary organizations to have completely unanimous views on many specific issues is practically impossible.

Chairman Mao said: "The interdependence and struggle between the contradictory aspects within all things determine the life of all things and push the development of all things. There is no such thing that does not contain contradictions, and without contradictions, there would be no world."

Under the premise of unanimity in the general direction, it is normal and inevitable for various revolutionary organizations to have differing views on specific issues. This difference in views on specific issues not only universally exists between various revolutionary organizations but also universally exists within a single revolutionary organization. Not only does it exist now, but it will also exist in the future. Because if views are unanimous in one period, new situations will arise over time, leading to differences.

Differing views on specific issues are not only objectively existent but also not necessarily bad. Among many differing views, some are more correct, and some are incorrect. In one issue, the view of this organization is correct, and in another issue, the view of that organization is correct. Therefore, as long as the general direction is unanimous, unity should be sought. Even if there are differing views on some specific issues, or even on certain principled issues, these can be resolved through exchanging views, presenting various opinions, discussing and comparing, and through criticism and self-criticism, arriving at the correct conclusion. This is beneficial for every revolutionary organization and for the current struggle.

Using differing views as an excuse to exclude other revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses, rather than uniting with them; not uniting the majority, but forming small cliques. As a result, sectarianism and factionalism are not overcome but will become even more severe. Therefore, emphasizing that "unanimity of views" is required for unity actually means wanting only the small unity of sectarianism, not the great unity of the revolution.

To achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, one must seek common ground while reserving differences, seeking unanimity in views on major directional issues, and reserving differences in views on minor issues. If complete unanimity of views is required, not even allowing for minor differences, one day it will inevitably lead to abandoning the common ground and focusing on minor differences. The reason why some units' revolutionary organizations do not fight and criticize those in power who are taking the capitalist road, but instead engage in unprincipled "internal warfare," lies partly here.

All proletarian revolutionary forces must, under the premise of unanimity in the general direction, promote revolutionary unity and not allow differing views on non-principled issues to hinder revolutionary unity.

    求大同　存小异
    陈裕文
    目前，在对待革命的大联合的问题上，有人认为，必须“观点一致”才能联合，否则就不能联合。
    如果要求在大方向上观点一致，这是完全正确的，毫无疑问的。但是，要求各个革命组织在许多具体问题上观点完全一致，实际上是办不到的。
    毛主席说：“一切事物中包含的矛盾方面的相互依赖和相互斗争，决定一切事物的生命，推动一切事物的发展。没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界。”
    各个革命组织之间，在大方向一致的前提下，在一些具体问题上观点不一致，是正常的，不可避免的。这种在具体问题上的观点不一致，不仅普遍存在于各革命组织之间，而且也普遍存在于一个革命组织内部；不仅现在存在，将来还会存在。因为一个时期观点一致了，过些时出现了新情况，又会发生不一致。
    在具体问题上观点不一致，不仅是客观存在，而且并非坏事。在许多不一致的观点中，总是有一些比较正确，有一些不正确。在这一个问题上，这个组织的意见是正确的，在另一个问题上，那一个组织的意见是正确的。所以，只要大方向一致，就应当联合起来，有些具体问题上观点不一致，甚至在某些原则问题上观点不一致，都可以通过交换意见的方式，把各种意见摆出来，经过讨论、比较，经过批评和自我批评，得出正确的结论。这对于每个革命组织，对于当前的斗争，都大有好处。
    借口观点不一致，对其他革命组织和革命群众，不是联合，而是排斥；不是团结大多数，而是搞小圈子。结果，山头主义、小团体主义不是克服了，而会发展得更加严重。所以强调“观点一致”才能联合，实际上是只要山头主义的小联合，不要革命的大联合。
    要实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，必须求大同存小异，求大方向问题上的观点之同，存枝节问题上的认识之异。如果要求观点完全一致，连小异也不准存，总有一天势必会抛弃大同，专攻小异。一些单位的革命组织把走资本主义道路当权派放在一边不斗争，不批判，全力打无原则的“内战”，原因之一就在这里。
    一切无产阶级革命派，一定要在大方向一致的前提下，促进革命的大联合，而不要由于非原则问题上观点不一致，妨碍革命的大联合。
