The recent "International Exhibition of Food Industry Equipment" held in Moscow by the Soviet revisionist leadership is a grand exhibition of the traitorous face of the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique.

This exhibition clearly displays the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist clique's worship of capitalism. You boast about "building communism," yet you invite a large number of American and other capitalist countries' monopolies to come and loudly promote Western "material civilization" and "lifestyle." This shows that you so-called "communists" are nothing more than salesmen for American canned goods and Coca-Cola. Your actions are aimed at corrupting the Soviet people so that you can fully restore capitalism in the Soviet Union. This is yet another piece of evidence of your betrayal of the October Revolution.

This exhibition also reveals the slavish attitude of the Soviet revisionist clique in their fervent pursuit of "full cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union." You actively respond to the "bridge-building" initiative of the American imperialist Johnson, opening the doors of the Soviet Union wide for American monopolies, and now you are currying favor with the American imperialists in Moscow, eager to throw your entire body into the embrace of American imperialism. Your few hoarse anti-American cries can hardly cover up your flattering smiles to American imperialism!

This exhibition also exposes the Soviet revisionist clique's evil deeds of pretending to support while actually betraying the revolutionary people of the world. Just as American imperialism brazenly invaded the demilitarized zone in Vietnam, you are getting along so warmly with American imperialism, once again exposing your complete hypocrisy in your so-called "support for Vietnam." At a time when the Arab people are facing the threat of invasion by American imperialism and its lackey Israel, you actually put on makeup for Israel. On the same day, you issue a government statement, hypocritically expressing support for the Arab people, while at the same time holding a so-called "Israel Day" at the exhibition. This farce fully exposes your treacherous and despicable methods towards the Arab people.

The most absurd thing is that the Soviet revisionist clique loudly promotes the slogan "Man, everything for you!" at the exhibition. This is truly a "creative" development of Khrushchev's "theory" of the "whole people's state." In the eyes of the Brezhnev clique, a "whole people's world" has already appeared. This is sheer nonsense. "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position." People either belong to this class or that class; where is there an abstract "man"? To erase the class nature of people is to erase class and class struggle, to betray the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. This is the essence of modern revisionism. The Soviet revisionist clique's so-called "everything for everyone" is a lie. All your actions are only for the benefit of your clique of Soviet privileged classes and your international cronies.

    苏修叛徒面目的大展览
    苏修领导集团最近在莫斯科搞的“食品工业装备国际展览会”，是勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的叛徒面目的一个大展览。
    这个展览会，向人们展示了苏修集团向资本主义顶礼膜拜的丑恶嘴脸。你们大吹大擂在“建设共产主义”，却招来大批美国和其他资本主义国家的垄断企业，让它们大肆宣扬西方的“物质文明”和“生活方式”。这说明，你们这些所谓“共产主义者”，不过是美国罐头和可口可乐的推销员罢了。你们这种做法，目的就是要腐蚀苏联人民，以便于你们在苏联全面复辟资本主义。这是你们背叛十月革命的又一罪证。
    这个展览会，也向人们展示了苏修集团狂热地追求“美苏全面合作”的奴才相。你们积极响应美帝头子约翰逊“搭桥”的“倡议”，不惜为美国的垄断资本打开苏联的门户，现在又在莫斯科向美帝大献殷勤，恨不得把整个身子都投进美帝国主义的怀抱。你们几声嘶哑的反美叫喊，岂能掩盖得住你们向美帝国主义的谄言媚笑？
    这个展览会，还向人们展示了苏修集团对世界革命人民假支持、真出卖的罪恶行径。正当美帝国主义在越南悍然入侵非军事区的前后，你们同美帝国主义打得这样火热，再次暴露了你们所谓“支援越南”的十足虚伪。正在阿拉伯人民面对着美帝及其走狗以色列侵略威胁的当儿，你们竟然为以色列涂脂抹粉。在同一天里，你们一方面发表政府声明，假惺惺地表示支持阿拉伯人民，另一方面却在展览会上举行所谓“以色列日”。这出丑剧，可算把你们对阿拉伯人民两面三刀的卑鄙手段暴露得淋漓尽致了。
    最荒唐的是，苏修集团竟在展览会上大肆宣扬“人，一切为了你！”的口号。这真是赫鲁晓夫的“全民国家”“理论”的“创造性”发展。在勃列日涅夫之流看来，已经出现一个“全民世界”了。这纯粹是鬼话。“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活”。人不是属于这个阶级就是属于那个阶级，哪有什么抽象的“人”？抹煞人的阶级性，就是抹煞阶级和阶级斗争，背叛无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，这正是现代修正主义的“精粹”所在。苏修集团所谓为了一切人，是骗人的。你们的一切所作所为，都只是为了你们这一伙苏联的特权阶层以及你们在国际上的狐朋狗友罢了。
