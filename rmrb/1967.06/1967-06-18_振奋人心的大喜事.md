	Heartening Great News
	Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works, Commander of a Certain Regiment in the Guangzhou Military Region, Zhang Ticheng

	At the moment when the people of the entire nation are launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, amidst the triumphant songs of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, another piece of heartening great news has arrived: our country's first hydrogen bomb has exploded successfully. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! It is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! It is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the clouds!

	The news of victory has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses, and has greatly dampened the spirits of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The news of victory has greatly inspired us to complete the tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, and military control and military training assigned to us by the great leader Chairman Mao. It has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of our country to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. It has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of the world to fight against imperialism and revisionism. The successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb has further declared the complete failure of the imperialists' and modern revisionists' dream of monopolizing nuclear weapons. It signifies that once the seven hundred million Chinese people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can create any miracle in the world.

	Looking up, I see the Big Dipper, and day and night I think of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you, the venerable, who have guided us from one victory to another. The People's Liberation Army is the army you, the venerable, have personally created, the most obedient to your words, and the most loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We pledge to you: we will resolutely unite with the revolutionary masses, fight with them, and win with them. We are determined to create new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    振奋人心的大喜事
    广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部团长　张体成
    当全国人民向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击的时候，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线节节胜利的凯歌声中，又传来了振奋人心的大喜讯：我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    胜利的喜讯，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风。胜利的喜讯，极大地鼓舞我们去胜利完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的支左、支工、支农和军管、军训任务，极大地鼓舞了我国革命人民誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，极大地鼓舞了世界革命人民反帝反修的勇气和信心。我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，进一步宣布了帝国主义和现代修正主义垄断核武器美梦的彻底破产。它标志着七亿中国人民一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。
    抬头看见北斗星，日夜想念毛主席。毛主席呀！毛主席！是您老人家引导我们从胜利走向胜利。人民解放军是您老人家亲手缔造的军队，最听您的话，最忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。我们向您宣誓：我们要坚决和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，决心在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民创立新功。
