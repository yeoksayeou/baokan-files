After a period of intense preparation, the White House announced on the 22nd that U.S. President Johnson and the head of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Kosygin, will hold talks on the 23rd in Glassboro, New Jersey.

U.S. officials revealed that this meeting will "primarily discuss substantive issues." Johnson will raise issues such as the Middle East, Vietnam, Southeast Asia, the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation," and the "anti-ballistic missile system." It is reported that further collusion against China is also an important agenda item for them. Especially after China's recent successful hydrogen bomb test, they will focus on discussing this issue.

This is the first time Kosygin has sat down with the U.S. imperialist leader to directly plot global-scale collusion since taking office. Since the new Soviet revisionist leadership took power, they have intensified the policy of surrender and betrayal formulated by Khrushchev, greatly tightening their collusion with U.S. imperialism. On the other hand, U.S. imperialism's global counter-revolutionary strategy has been repeatedly thwarted, and their days are getting harder. They urgently need the Soviet revisionist leadership to serve them further. This meeting is held against this background.

Kosygin is leading a large delegation to the United States, ostensibly to attend an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, but in reality, to meet the needs of the U.S. empire, he will have direct secret talks with Johnson to discuss the criminal collusion of selling out the interests of the Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, due to concerns about global public opinion condemnation, both sides have been evasive and secretive beforehand, even arranging the meeting place with great care. Johnson originally proposed to meet Kosygin in Washington or Camp David, but Kosygin was afraid of appearing too eager and proactive, which would further expose his traitorous face seeking Soviet-U.S. collusion. Therefore, he hesitated and was reluctant to agree. Finally, it was arranged to meet at a location midway between New York and Washington.

In fact, his pretenses are all for show. After arriving in the United States, Kosygin and Johnson have already given speeches on the 19th, singing in unison, both expressing eagerness to conduct a global-scale deal. Johnson openly declared that he wants to "expand the scope of joint action with the Soviet Union" on issues such as Vietnam and the Middle East. Kosygin, on the other hand, openly guaranteed that he is willing to "find common ground" with U.S. imperialism on these issues. Western newspapers and news agencies have already revealed that although Kosygin is "concerned" about being condemned by the people of the world, he is still "eager to meet Johnson" and have extensive "substantive discussions" with him.

In fact, while Kosygin is putting on a show, claiming he will "soon" return to Moscow, high-level officials from both sides have been in close contact, preparing for this meeting. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held three consecutive meetings from the 20th to the 22nd. On the 22nd, Rusk also met with Kosygin. Before this, Johnson had ordered the postponement of the original plan for U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler to "inspect" Saigon, in order to consult.

In addition, Johnson and Kosygin have recently held extensive talks with UN Secretary-General U Thant, British Foreign Secretary Brown, and other government leaders attending this emergency session of the UN General Assembly. All of this indicates that a large-scale political deal is brewing.

### 约翰逊招降纳叛　柯西金登门求见  美苏头目反革命黑会鸣锣开场

    约翰逊招降纳叛　柯西金登门求见
    美苏头目反革命黑会鸣锣开场
    新华社二十三日讯  华盛顿消息：经过了一番紧张的准备之后，美国白宫二十二日宣布，美国总统约翰逊同苏联修正主义领导集团头目柯西金，定于二十三日在美国新泽西州葛拉斯堡罗举行会谈。
    美国官员透露，这次会谈“将主要讨论实质性问题”，约翰逊将提出讨论的问题有中东、越南、东南亚、所谓“防止核扩散”和“反弹道导弹系统”等问题。据报道，双方进一步勾结反华，也是他们的重要议题之一。特别是在中国最近成功地爆炸氢弹之后，他们将着重讨论这个问题。
    这是柯西金上台后第一次同美帝国主义头目坐在一起直接策划全球性的大勾结。苏修新领导上台以来，变本加厉地推行赫鲁晓夫制定的投降、叛卖政策，大大加紧了同美帝国主义的勾结；而另一方面，美帝国主义的反革命全球战略不断遭到挫败，日子越来越不好过，急需苏修领导集团进一步为它效劳。这次会谈就是在这样一种背景下举行的。
    柯西金这次率领一个庞大的代表团到美国去，名义上是参加联合国大会紧急会议，实际上是适应美帝的需要，同约翰逊直接密谈出卖越南人民、阿拉伯人民和亚非拉人民革命利益的罪恶勾当。但是，由于担心世界舆论的谴责，事前双方一直遮遮掩掩，密而不宣，甚至连会谈地点也经过了一番煞费苦心的安排。约翰逊原来表示要在华盛顿或戴维营同柯西金会谈，但是，柯西金害怕显得过于热心、主动，会更加暴露其追求苏美勾结的叛徒面目，因而忸怩作态，迟迟不敢答应。最后，才安排了在纽约和华盛顿中途的一个地点举行会晤。
    其实，他的这番做作完全是掩耳盗铃。柯西金在到美国以后，已经同约翰逊一先一后在十九日发表演说，此唱彼和，一致表示急于进行全球性大交易。约翰逊公开声称，要在越南、中东等一系列问题上，“扩大同苏联采取共同行动的领域”；柯西金则公开保证，愿意在这些问题上，同美帝国主义“找到共同语言”。西方报刊通讯社早已纷纷透露，柯西金虽然“担心”受到世界人民的谴责，但还是“渴望会见约翰逊”，同约翰逊进行广泛的“实质性讨论”。
    事实上，在柯西金装模作样，口口声声“很快”就要回莫斯科的同时，双方高级官员一直在密切接触，为这次会谈进行准备。美国国务卿腊斯克同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯从二十日到二十二日，一连三次会谈。二十二日，腊斯克还会见了柯西金。在此以前，约翰逊为了这次会谈还下令推迟了美国国防部长麦克纳马拉、参谋长联席会议主席惠勒等人原定去西贡“视察”的计划，以备咨询。
    此外，约翰逊、柯西金最近几天还分别同联合国秘书长吴丹、英国外交大臣布朗及出席这次联大紧急会议的其他一些政府首脑进行了广泛的会谈。这一切都表明，一场大规模的政治交易正在酝酿之中。
