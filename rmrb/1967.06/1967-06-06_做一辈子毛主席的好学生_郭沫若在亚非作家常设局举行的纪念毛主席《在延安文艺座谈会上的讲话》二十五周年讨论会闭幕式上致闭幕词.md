Dear students and comrades!

We are all students of Chairman Mao. Over the past six days, we have collectively studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." We have studied it very seriously, truly with reverence and sincerity.

We have already written our reflections in the form of a "Letter of Salutation to Chairman Mao" and a "Call to Arms" for revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa. These can be considered our "graduation theses." Therefore, tonight's closing ceremony can also be seen as our "graduation ceremony."

We are very pleased that the leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and other relevant departments—Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Xie Fuzhi, Jiang Qing, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Mu Xin, Ye Qun, and Wang Dongxing, as well as other comrades—have taken the time to personally attend our graduation ceremony. Comrade Chen Boda also gave us an inspiring report. This has greatly encouraged us, and we cannot help but express our heartfelt thanks.

At the same time, we must also congratulate each other on the great success of our study and discussion of Chairman Mao's works.

Comrades and students!

Although our discussion meeting has ended, our learning has not. We must not only learn but also practice. Learning is endless; it never stops.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is a correct theory, but it is only talked about and not put into practice, then no matter how good the theory is, it is meaningless."

Chairman Mao also says: "Reading is learning, and using what you have learned is also learning, and it is even more important learning. ... Often, it is not about learning first and then doing, but about doing and then learning. Doing is learning."

Emphasizing practice and ensuring that words match deeds is an important characteristic of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao himself is the practitioner of this great thought. Chairman Mao, through continuous practice and struggle, has greatly advanced the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, developing Marxism-Leninism to its current new stage.

Therefore, to be good students of Chairman Mao, we must learn from Chairman Mao's spirit of practice and action. This spirit can be called the "Shaoshan Spirit," the "Yan'an Spirit," the "Long March Spirit," and the "Jinggangshan Spirit." We must practice this spirit, popularize this spirit, and deeply understand this spirit. We must be doers, not just talkers. We must learn and then apply what we have learned, and learn quickly when applying. Only then can we achieve active learning and application.

These insights are already mentioned in our "Letter of Salutation" and "Call to Arms." I am particularly emphasizing them here to encourage myself. I am an old student of Chairman Mao, but I have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works poorly; I have not learned actively, and I have applied even less actively. I hope that my fellow students will continually encourage me to keep up with their progress and move forward!

Comrades and students!

In the six days of study and discussion, and in the speeches of more than thirty fellow students, everything that needed to be said has been said, and there is nothing left for me to add. In summary, our discussion meeting was the first international conference to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and it was a successful conference. This is worth commemorating. Last night, I wrote a poem to express my deep feelings of remembrance. Please allow me to recite my rough poem, dedicating it to Comrade Jiang Qing present here, as well as to all comrades and fellow students.

Thirty-four countries, more than eighty students of Chairman Mao,
From six continents, holding high the boundless beacon of light,
That is Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,"
Illuminating the souls of each of us students,
Illuminating the path of revolutionary literature and art in Asia and Africa.
We will wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao's instructions,
Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, transforming both the subjective and objective worlds.
We will overthrow the American imperialists, overthrow the Soviet revisionists, and overthrow all reactionaries,
And restore the history of humanity that has been turned upside down.
We will not disappoint the great red era of Mao Zedong!
Dear Comrade Jiang Qing, you are our excellent example of learning,
You are skilled in actively applying the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.
You bravely charge forward on the literary and artistic front,
Filling the Chinese stage with the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers;
We will also fill the world stage with the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers!
China's yesterday is the today of most countries in Asia and Africa,
China's today is the tomorrow of most countries in Asia and Africa.
We will strive for the great liberation of oppressed nations and peoples,
And plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought throughout Asia and Africa,
And plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the six continents and four seas!
Chairman Mao's brilliant works are our eternal spiritual nourishment.
We will be selfless and dedicated, learning from the noble example of Norman Bethune;
We will be new Yu Gong, casting the three mountains of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries into the ocean!
Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts,
We wish you eternal life, eternal life, eternal eternal life!
Comrades and students! My poem recitation is over. Our discussion meeting has concluded successfully. Let us work together to ensure that the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers, to be held in Beijing in November, achieves even greater success!

Long live the unity of revolutionary writers and peoples of Asia and Africa!
Long live the great unity of revolutionary writers and peoples of the world!
Long live the great liberation of all oppressed nations and peoples of the world!
Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great era of Mao Zedong!
Long live the great teacher, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

### 做一辈子毛主席的好学生  郭沫若在亚非作家常设局举行的纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会闭幕式上致闭幕词

    做一辈子毛主席的好学生
    郭沫若在亚非作家常设局举行的纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会闭幕式上致闭幕词
    新华社五日讯　中国作家代表团团长郭沫若今天在亚非作家常设局举行的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会”闭幕式上致闭幕词。全文如下：亲爱的同学们！同志们！
    我们都是毛主席的学生，用了六天功夫共同学习了毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。我们学习得非常认真，的的确确是恭恭敬敬地在学，老老实实地在学。
    我们已经把我们的心得写成了《给毛主席的致敬信》和对亚非革命进步作家的《号召书》，这就是我们的“毕业”论文。因此，今晚的闭幕式也可以说就是我们的“毕业”典礼了。
    我们非常高兴中共中央的领导同志和中央文化革命小组以及其他有关方面的领导同志——周恩来同志、陈伯达同志、康生同志、谢富治同志、江青同志、萧华同志、杨成武同志、王力同志、关锋同志、戚本禹同志、穆欣同志、叶群同志、汪东兴同志，还有其他同志，在百忙当中亲自来参加了我们的毕业典礼，戚本禹同志还为我们作了富于启发性的报告。这使我们受到很大的鼓舞，我们不能不表示衷心的感谢。
    同时我们也不能不相互庆贺，庆贺我们的学习毛主席著作的讨论会，获得了很大的成功。
    同志们，同学们！
    我们的讨论会虽然结束了，但我们的学习并没有结束。学了还要用，还要实践。学习是没有尽境的，一辈子也不能结束。
    毛主席教导我们：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”
    毛主席又说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。……常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”
    着重实践，着重言行一致，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的一个重要的特征。毛主席自己也就是这种伟大思想的实践躬行者。毛主席是在不断地实践中，不断地战斗中，把中国革命和世界革命大力推进了，把马克思列宁主义发展到了目前的崭新的阶段。
    因此，我们要做毛主席的好学生，就要向毛主席的实践躬行的精神好好地学习。这种精神可以称为“韶山精神”、“延安精神”、“长征精神”、“井冈山精神”。我们就是要实践这种精神，普及这种精神，深入这种精神。我们要做实行家，不要做空谈家。学了就用，用时急学，这样才能够做到活学活用。
    这些体会，我们在《致敬信》中和《号召书》中都已经讲到了。我现在特别提出来，主要的用意是在鞭策我自己。我自己是一位毛主席的老学生，但是对于毛主席的著作学得很差，用得也很差；学得不活，用得更不活。我希望同学们对于我要不断地加以鞭策，使我能够跟得上同学们的步伐不断前进！
    同志们，同学们！
    在六天的学习讨论中，在三十多位同学们的发言中，把所有应该说的话都说尽了，没有什么可以让我来补充的了。总之，我们的讨论会是第一次宣扬毛泽东思想的国际会议，而且是一次成功的会议。这是值得我们纪念的。昨天晚上我做了一首诗来表达我深刻的纪念情绪，请允许我把我的粗糙的诗朗诵出来，献给在座的江青同志，也献给各位同志和各位同学。
    三十四个国家的八十多位毛主席的学生，
    来自六大洲，高擎着光焰无际的指路明灯，
    那就是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，
    照亮了我们每一位同学的灵魂深处，
    照亮了亚非革命文艺的前进的路途。
    我们要全心全意地照着毛主席的指示办事，
    一生为工农兵服务，改造主观世界和客观世界。
    要打倒美帝、打倒苏修、打倒一切的反动派，
    要把被颠倒了的人类历史重新颠倒过来。
    我们决不辜负伟大的红彤彤的毛泽东时代！
    亲爱的江青同志，你是我们学习的好榜样，
    你善于活学活用战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    你奋不顾身地在文艺战线上陷阵冲锋，
    使中国舞台充满了工农兵的英雄形象；
    我们要使世界舞台也充满着工农兵的英雄形象！
    中国的昨天是亚非多数国家的今天，
    中国的今天是亚非多数国家的明天。
    我们要争取被压迫民族和人民的大解放，
    要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗向亚非各国插遍，
    要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗向六洲四海插遍！
    毛主席的光辉著作是我们永远的精神食粮。
    我们要毫不利己、专门利人，学白求恩那样高尚；
    我们要做新愚公，把帝修反三座大山投入海洋！
    毛主席啊，你是我们心中的最红最红的红太阳，
    我们祝愿你万寿无疆，万寿无疆，万万寿无疆！
    同志们，同学们！我的诗朗诵完了。我们的讨论会胜利闭幕了。祝我们共同努力，使十一月将在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会获得更大的胜利！
    亚非革命作家和革命人民团结万岁！
    世界革命作家和革命人民大团结万岁！
    全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民大解放万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东时代万岁！
    伟大的导师毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
