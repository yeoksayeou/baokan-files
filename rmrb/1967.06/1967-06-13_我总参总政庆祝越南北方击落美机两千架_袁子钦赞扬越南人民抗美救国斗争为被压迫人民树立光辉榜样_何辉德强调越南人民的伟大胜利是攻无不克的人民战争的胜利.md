The Chinese People's Liberation Army General Staff and General Political Department held a grand meeting today to celebrate the great victory of the Vietnamese people and military in the North in shooting down 2,000 US imperialist aircraft.

Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Vu Minh Quynh, was invited to attend the meeting.

Vice Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yuan Ziqin, and Deputy Military Attaché of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Embassy in China, He Huide, spoke at the meeting. Yuan Ziqin said, the heroic Vietnamese people and their army, under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have made outstanding contributions to the anti-US struggle of the people of the world in the war of resistance against US aggression for national salvation. They have set a brilliant example for all oppressed, invaded, and enslaved nations and peoples in the world with their courageous struggle.

Yuan Ziqin pointed out that the US imperialists thought that by relying on their so-called "air superiority" to carry out indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam, they could subdue the Vietnamese people and achieve their despicable goal of "bombing to force surrender." However, their calculations were completely wrong; the more they bombed, the more powerful the counterattacks by the Vietnamese people and military; the higher the level of their aggression, the higher the level of their failure.

He said, the great victory of the Vietnamese people in the war of resistance against US aggression for national salvation tells us that people's war is the most effective weapon to defeat US imperialism. Whether in South Vietnam or North Vietnam, US imperialism is always surrounded and attacked by the people. As our great leader Chairman Mao said, "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we must be able to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." US imperialism has already fallen into the vast sea of people's war in the Vietnam battlefield and is facing imminent doom!

Yuan Ziqin exposed and strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionists for actively colluding with US imperialism to play various tricks of so-called "peace talks," attempting to force the heroic Vietnamese people to abandon their hard-won victories and surrender to the US aggressors. He said, the enemy's tricks have been smashed and exposed time and time again by the Vietnamese people who dare to struggle and are good at struggling. The ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in pretending to support but actually betraying the Vietnamese people under the guise of "joint action" has been seen through by more and more people. The heinous crimes committed by US imperialism and modern revisionism against the Vietnamese people will one day be settled.

He said, our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The fact that the Vietnamese brothers have fought the US imperialists to the point of exhaustion completely proves that US imperialism is a decaying force heading towards extinction, a paper tiger!

Yuan Ziqin said, the Chinese people have always regarded supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world as their sacred internationalist duty. To support the Vietnamese brothers in thoroughly defeating the US aggressors, the Chinese people are willing to make the greatest national sacrifices. The seven hundred million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will, according to the requirements of the Vietnamese government and people, be ready to take all necessary actions at any time. The Chinese people always keep their word. No matter how high a level the US imperialists raise the war to, or how wide a range they expand the war, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will be determined to support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their just struggle of resistance against US aggression for national salvation to the end.

He Huide detailed the brilliant achievements of the Vietnamese people and military in the war of resistance against US aggression for national salvation and pointed out that the US imperialists have been continuously escalating the war, but the higher they climb, the harder they fall. He said, bombs cannot intimidate the Vietnamese people; instead, they have aroused even greater hatred among the people of the North, making them strongly support their fellow countrymen in the South. Similarly, the US imperialists' escalation of the war cannot stop the revolutionary storm in the South from rising higher and higher, achieving one great victory after another.

He said, the more the Vietnamese people fight, the greater their victories. This great victory is a victory of the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party led by Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, a victory of the iron will of the hardworking, brave, and intelligent heroic Vietnamese people, a victory of the Vietnamese people's ability to fully mobilize the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, high class consciousness, and true internationalism to promote the victory of the Vietnamese revolution. It is a victory of the people's war that has reached the highest level of invincibility. It is also a victory of the support of the people of the world for us.

He Huide strongly condemned the US imperialists for continuously escalating the war of aggression and desperately peddling the "peace talks" deception.

He Huide praised the Chinese people for achieving great victories in building a socialist power under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the respected Chairman Mao. He also thanked the Chinese people for their continuous and resolute support for the Vietnamese people.

Those invited to attend the meeting also included Secretary Nguyen Thuan of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China. Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Peng Shaohui, Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department, Zhang Xianyue, and responsible personnel from various military branches and services, as well as representatives of more than 700 ground, naval, and air force officers and soldiers, attended the meeting.

    我总参总政庆祝越南北方击落美机两千架
    袁子钦赞扬越南人民抗美救国斗争为被压迫人民树立光辉榜样
    何辉德强调越南人民的伟大胜利是攻无不克的人民战争的胜利
    据新华社十二日讯  中国人民解放军总参谋部和总政治部今天隆重集会，庆祝越南北方军民击落美帝国主义飞机两千架的伟大胜利。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾应邀出席了大会。
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任袁子钦和越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆副武官何辉德在大会上先后讲话。袁子钦说，英雄的越南人民及其军队，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明领导下，在抗美救国战争中，不怕牺牲，艰苦奋战，对世界各国人民的反美斗争作出了卓越的贡献。他们用自己的英勇斗争，为世界一切被压迫、被侵略、被奴役的国家和民族，树立了光辉的榜样。
    袁子钦指出，美帝国主义满以为凭借它的所谓“空中优势”，对越南北方进行狂轰滥炸，就可以把越南人民压倒，实现它“以炸迫和”、“以炸迫降”的卑鄙目的。然而它的如意算盘完全打错了，它越是炸得凶，越南军民给予的回击越加有力；它的侵略战争每升一级，它的失败也随着上升一级。
    他说，越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利雄辩地告诉我们：人民战争是置美帝国主义于死地的最有效的法宝。不管在越南南方，还是在越南北方，美帝国主义无时无刻不在人民的包围和痛击之中。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗”。美帝国主义在越南战场，已陷入人民战争的汪洋大海之中，已面临着灭顶之灾！
    袁子钦揭露和强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者积极配合美帝国主义玩弄各种各样的所谓“和谈”阴谋，企图胁迫英雄的越南人民放弃已经取得的胜利，向美国侵略者屈服。他说，敌人的这些阴谋诡计，都被敢于斗争，善于斗争的越南人民一次又一次地粉碎了，戳穿了。苏联修正主义领导集团在所谓“联合行动”的幌子下，对越南人民假支持、真出卖的丑恶嘴脸，已被越来越多的人所识破。美帝国主义和现代修正主义者对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行，总有一天会得到清算。
    他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”兄弟的越南军民把美帝国主义打得焦头烂额的事实，完全证明美帝国主义是正在走向灭亡的腐朽势力，是纸老虎！
    袁子钦说，中国人民一贯把支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，当作自己神圣的国际主义义务。为了支持越南兄弟彻底打败美国侵略者，中国人民不惜作出最大的民族牺牲。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军，将根据越南政府和人民的要求，随时准备采取一切必要的行动。中国人民从来是说了话算数的。不论美帝国主义把战争升到那一级，把战火扩大到多大范围，中国人民和中国人民解放军，都决心支持越南人民把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底。
    何辉德详细介绍了越南军民在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌战绩后指出，美帝国主义不断地扩大战争升级，但是它们爬得越高，摔得就越痛，他说，炸弹吓不倒越南人民，相反地它更激起了北方人民的仇恨，使他们大力支援南方同胞。同样地，美帝国主义的战争升级也阻挡不了南方革命暴风雨般地不断高涨，取得一个又一个的巨大胜利。
    他说，越南人民越战越勇，胜利就越大。这一伟大的胜利是以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导和越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导的胜利，是勤劳而勇敢的英雄的聪明的越南人民钢铁般的决心的胜利，是越南人民善于充分发扬工人阶级的彻底革命精神、高度的阶级觉悟和真正的国际主义精神来促进越南革命取得全胜的胜利。是发展到最大高度的攻无不克的人民战争的胜利。这也是世界人民对我们的支持的胜利。
    何辉德强烈谴责美帝国主义不断扩大侵略战争升级，并且竭力兜售“和谈”骗局。
    何辉德赞扬中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在建设社会主义强国中所取得的巨大胜利。他还感谢中国人民一直给予越南人民以巨大而坚决的支持。
    应邀出席大会的，还有越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团秘书阮顺和等。中国人民解放军副总参谋长彭绍辉、总后勤部副部长张贤约，以及各军种、兵种的负责人和陆海空军指战员代表七百多人出席了大会。
