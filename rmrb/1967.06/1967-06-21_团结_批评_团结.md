In his epoch-making work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao teaches us that to resolve contradictions among the people, we must adopt the method of "unity – criticism – unity." "To put it more concretely, it means starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism or struggle to resolve contradictions, and thus achieving new unity on a new basis."

As early as 1945, Chairman Mao pointed out in his great work "On Coalition Government": "The Chinese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, has produced a new style of work among the Chinese people. This mainly consists of the style of combining theory with practice, of close ties with the masses, and of self-criticism."

Chairman Mao further pointed out: "Whether or not there is serious self-criticism is also a prominent feature that distinguishes us from other parties."

Currently, there are still people who do not understand the importance of criticism and self-criticism. They do not understand that "unity – criticism – unity" is the method that Chairman Mao has always advocated, the only correct method for resolving contradictions among the people. They do not understand that there is no other method besides this one.

Some comrades think that they are perfect. When they have shortcomings and errors, they do not engage in serious self-criticism and do not allow others to criticize them, posing the danger of creating a "one-man show." This is metaphysical and does not conform to the epistemology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

In his novel "The True Story of Ah Q," Lu Xun wrote about a backward peasant who was most afraid of being criticized and would fight with others at the slightest criticism. He had several scabby sores on his head, which he did not want to talk about and was afraid others would mention. The more he tried to hide them, the more others talked about them, ultimately putting him in a very passive position. As advanced and awakened proletarians, can we be like Ah Q?

Comrades in positions of power, in particular, must promote democracy, encourage others to criticize, listen to others' criticisms, and be able to withstand criticism. For one's own mistakes, one should take the initiative and first engage in self-criticism. If one has already been passive, one must seriously listen to everyone's criticisms, sit down calmly, and sincerely reflect. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you let people speak, the sky will not fall, and you will not collapse. If you do not let people speak, you will inevitably collapse one day. This is an unshakable truth."

There are also some comrades who often go from one extreme to another. When it comes to criticizing their comrades or dealing with contradictions within the people, if there is no criticism, it seems that others have no shortcomings or errors; but once criticism begins, or if there is any "rumor," they think that others are "deserving of death" and must be "overthrown." Our comrades are not enemies; if they make mistakes in their work, correcting them is good. Why not allow others to correct their mistakes and allow them to revolutionize themselves?

In the same novel, "The True Story of Ah Q," Lu Xun specially wrote a chapter titled "Not Allowing Revolution," describing a landlord's son who had studied in Japan, who did not allow Ah Q to join the "revolutionary party." Ah Q wanted to join the "revolutionary party" at the landlord's son's place but was driven away with a wailing stick. Ah Q's so-called revolution was merely to steal some things. Yet, even such a revolution was not allowed. As revolutionary proletarians, can we be like this landlord's son?

For comrades who have made mistakes, our party's policy is "to punish past mistakes and prevent future ones, to cure the sickness and save the patient," "to look first and help second," and "unity – criticism – unity."

Chairman Mao said: "To carry out criticism, one must first start with the desire for unity. Because if one does not have the subjective desire for unity, once a struggle begins, it will inevitably make things chaotic and uncontrollable. That would not be 'ruthless struggle and merciless blows'? Where would there be party unity?"

Chairman Mao said: "Whether to adopt an antagonistic attitude or a helping attitude towards comrades who have made mistakes is a criterion for distinguishing whether a person has good intentions or bad intentions."

Within the people, if one strikes a comrade who has made a mistake with a single blow, it blurs the line between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and in fact, it also denies the formula of "unity – criticism – unity." Doing so is metaphysical and goes against the epistemology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

It should be pointed out that those who cannot correctly use the weapon of criticism to help comrades who have made mistakes often cannot seriously engage in self-criticism either.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls. Without "correct and not distorted, serious and not perfunctory criticism and self-criticism," it is impossible to touch people's souls.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, within the masses, within the revolutionary teachers and students, all kinds of contradictions among the people must be handled correctly and effectively according to the formula of "unity – criticism – unity"; all must fully use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to work better and rectify styles.

By doing so, we will be able to unite all those who can be united, concentrate our forces to severely strike the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and raise our struggle to a higher level.

### 团结——批评——团结

    团结——批评——团结
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部划时代的光辉著作中教导我们，解决人民内部矛盾，必须采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法。“讲详细一点，就是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。”
    早在一九四五年，毛主席在《论联合政府》这部伟大著作中就指出：“以马克思列宁主义的理论思想武装起来的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要的就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。”
    毛主席又指出：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”
    目前，还有人不懂得批评和自我批评的重要。他们不懂得团结——批评——团结，是毛主席历来教导的方法，是解决人民内部矛盾唯一正确的方法。他们不懂得除了这个方法以外，没有别的方法。
    有些同志，认为自己是完美无缺的。有了缺点错误，不作认真的自我批评，也不许人家批评，存在着搞“一言堂”的危险。这是形而上学的，是不符合马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的认识论的。
    鲁迅在《阿Q正传》这篇小说里写了一个落后的农民，最怕人家批评，一批评就和人家打架。他头皮上长了几处癞疮疤，自己不愿说，也怕人家说，愈是这样，人家说得愈厉害，结果闹得很被动。我们先进而觉悟了的无产阶级，难道能够象阿Q那样吗？
    处在当权地位的同志，特别要发扬民主，要启发人家批评，要听人家的批评，要经得起批评。对于自己的错误，应当采取主动，首先作自我批评。如果已经被动了，就更要认真听取大家的批评，自己坐下来冷静地想一想，诚诚恳恳地作检讨。毛主席教导我们：让人讲话，天不会塌下来，自己也不会垮台。不让人讲话呢？那就难免有一天要垮台。这是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    还有一些同志，往往从一个极端走到另一个极端。对待自己的同志，对待人民内部性质的问题，没有开展批评的时候，好象人家什么缺点错误都没有；而一开展批评，或者听到什么“风声”，就认为人家“罪该万死”，必须“打倒”。我们的同志，不是敌人，在工作中如果有错误，改了就好。为什么不允许人家改正错误，不允许人家革命呢？
    还是在那篇《阿Q正传》里，鲁迅专门写了“不准革命”一章，说有个留过东洋的地主少爷叫假洋鬼子，他不准阿Q革命。阿Q想到假洋鬼子那里参加“革命党”，却被他扬起哭丧棒赶了出来。其实，阿Q的所谓革命，不过是想抢点东西而已。可是，这样的革命也还是不准。我们革命的无产阶级，难道能够象假洋鬼子那样吗？
    对犯了错误的同志，我们党的政策是“惩前毖后，治病救人”，“一看二帮”，“团结——批评——团结”。
    毛主席说：开展批评，“首先需要从团结的愿望出发。因为如果在主观上没有团结的愿望，一斗势必把事情斗乱，不可收拾，那还不是‘残酷斗争，无情打击’？那还有什么党的团结？”
    毛主席说过：对待犯错误的同志，究竟是采取敌视态度还是采取帮助态度，这是区别一个人是好心还是坏心的一个标准。
    在人民内部，对犯错误的同志一棍子打死，就混淆了人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的界限，实际上也是否认了团结——批评——团结这个公式。这样做，也是形而上学的，是违反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的认识论的。
    应当指出，不能正确地运用批评的武器去帮助犯错误同志的人，往往也不能认真地开展自我批评。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。没有“正确的而不是歪曲的、认真的而不是敷衍的批评和自我批评”，也就不可能触及人们的灵魂。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，在群众内部，在革命师生内部，都要按照团结——批评——团结这个公式，正确地、有成效地处理各种人民内部的矛盾；都要充分地运用批评和自我批评的武器，来更好地进行工作，整顿作风。
    我们这样做，才有利于团结一切可以团结的人们，集中力量狠狠地打击党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把我们的斗争提到更高的水平。
