According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Madrid: The Spanish Marxist-Leninist journal "Workers' World" recently published a special issue on the Chinese Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. It warmly applauds China's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards.

The special issue, in an article titled "The Chinese Cultural Revolution," wrote passionately: "Mao Zedong is 'the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.' Mao Zedong Thought is 'the Marxism-Leninism of today.' To acknowledge it or resist it, to support it or oppose it, to love it or hate it, is the dividing line and touchstone between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, Marxism-Leninism and revisionism."

The article states: "The fact that the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the party, the government, and the military in the Soviet Union is a serious lesson for the proletariat of the whole world. The Chinese Party and the broad revolutionary masses have well absorbed this lesson and will never allow those anti-party, anti-socialist revisionist elements to change the great color of China."

Another article in the special issue states: "Many who call themselves communists believe that once the proletariat seizes power, everything is fine. The Soviet revisionist clique says that in their countries, class struggle no longer exists. This is a betrayal of Marxist-Leninist principles."

The article points out: "The Chinese people are helping the people of the whole world to gain liberation through their struggle against bourgeois and revisionist thought."

The article concludes by saying, "In the name of all the people of Spain, Spanish communists pay tribute to the people of China, the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong."

    西班牙革命刊物盛赞我文化大革命推动世界反修斗争
    苏修的阶级斗争熄灭论是叛徒理论
    据新华社讯　马德里消息：西班牙马列主义刊物《工人的世界》最近出版了关于中国无产阶级文化大革命的特刊，热情地歌颂毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想，热烈地赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵。
    特刊在一篇题为《中国无产阶级文化大革命》的文章中热情洋溢地写道：毛泽东是“我们当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”。毛泽东思想是“当代的马克思列宁主义”“承认它还是抵制它，赞成它还是反对它，热爱它还是仇视它，是区别革命和反革命，真革命和假革命，马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分界线和试金石。”
    文章说：“赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团在苏联篡党、篡政、篡军的事实，对全世界无产阶级是一个严重的教训。中国党和广大的革命群众很好地吸收了这一教训，绝不让那些反党反社会主义的修正主义分子改变伟大的中国的颜色。”
    特刊的另一篇文章写道：“许多自称为共产党人的人认为，无产阶级夺取了政权，一切都万事大吉了，苏联修正主义集团就说，在它们国家里，已经不存在阶级斗争了。这是对马克思列宁主义原则的背叛。”
    文章指出：“中国人民正在以他们的反对资产阶级和修正主义思想的斗争帮助全世界人民获得解放。”
    文章最后说，西班牙共产党人“以全体西班牙人民的名义，向中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东同志致敬。”
