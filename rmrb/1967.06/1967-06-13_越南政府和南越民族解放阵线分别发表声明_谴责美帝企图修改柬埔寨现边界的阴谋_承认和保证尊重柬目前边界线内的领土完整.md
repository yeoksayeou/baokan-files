The statement acknowledges and guarantees respect for Cambodia's territorial integrity within its current borders and acknowledges and guarantees respect for the current border line between South Vietnam and Cambodia.

The statement strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist and its puppets in South Vietnam and Thailand for their plots and actions of aggression against the Kingdom of Cambodia; it firmly opposes all plots aimed at altering Cambodia's current borders.

The statement says: "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's policy on the Cambodian border and its entire policy towards the Kingdom of Cambodia are in line with the current interests of the two peoples in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and in the defense of each country's sacred national rights. At the same time, it is in line with the long-term interests of each country's people in building their lives in all aspects according to their own wishes. This policy is an active contribution to the cause of defending peace and security in this region."

The Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam recently published a commentary stating that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's statement on the Cambodian border issue is a new and beautiful development in the friendly relations and combat unity between the people of South Vietnam and the brotherly people of Cambodia.
