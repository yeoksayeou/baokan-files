The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association today issued a statement warmly hailing the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb and extending warm congratulations to the Chinese government and people on this magnificent achievement. The statement pointed out that China's first hydrogen bomb was exploded during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. This is another victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The successful explosion of the Chinese hydrogen bomb is a great inspiration to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who bravely resist U.S. imperialism and oppose modern revisionism, as well as to the people of the whole world.

The statement said, In less than three years, the Chinese people have shattered the illusions of U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists and successfully exploded their first hydrogen bomb. This shows what great things a truly liberated country that implements socialist policies and is armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought can accomplish in a short period of time. This successful explosion also proves that China's achievements in the development of science and technology are unprecedented.

The statement said, The successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb not only strengthens the defense forces of the world's revolutionary base—China—but also gives great encouragement and boosts the confidence of the people of the world who are fighting for national liberation, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Revolutionary fighters around the world now know that they also have the hydrogen bomb.

The statement said, The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association warmly welcomes the declaration of the Chinese government and people: They conduct nuclear tests and develop nuclear weapons ultimately and completely for the purpose of eliminating nuclear weapons. Under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons.

The statement concluded with the following slogans: "Smash the nuclear blackmail of imperialism and modern revisionism!" "Long live the revolutionary people of China, the close comrades-in-arms of the people of the world!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought, the guiding principle and spiritual atom bomb of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!"

This statement was read at the closing ceremony of the fifth plenary meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association, which was held this afternoon along with the Chinese Journalists Association. Representatives from various countries spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically hailing China's successful explosion of the first hydrogen bomb.

During the reading of the message from the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association about the successful explosion of the Chinese hydrogen bomb, and when various friends mentioned China's great achievement, there were continuous bursts of warm applause and shouts of "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao!"

    声明说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处热烈欢迎中国政府和人民的声明：他们进行核试验和发展核武器，最终完全是为了消灭核武器。在任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。
    声明最后以这样一些口号作结束：“粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义的核讹诈！”“世界人民的亲密战友、革命的中国人民万岁！”“亚、非、拉人民的指导原则和精神原子弹——毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    这个声明，是在亚非记协和中国记协今天下午举行的庆祝亚非记协书记处第五次全体会议胜利闭幕的大会上宣读的。各国代表在会上发言的时候也热烈欢呼中国成功地爆炸第一颗氢弹。
    大会在宣读亚非记协书记处关于欢呼中国氢弹爆炸成功的消息的时候，在各国朋友谈到中国的这一巨大成就的时候，不断爆发出热烈的掌声和“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”“世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。
