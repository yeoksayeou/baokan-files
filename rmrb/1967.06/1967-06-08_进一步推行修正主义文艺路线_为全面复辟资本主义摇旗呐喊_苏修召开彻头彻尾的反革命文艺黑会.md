The Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique meticulously orchestrated the so-called Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers, which recently concluded in Moscow. This was a black meeting that desperately pushed the revisionist literary line to its bitter end; it was a thoroughly counter-revolutionary, anti-Marxist-Leninist, and anti-Chinese black meeting.

At the opening of this six-day conference, the Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others attended and delivered a "congratulatory message," urging Soviet revisionist writers to further strive for the implementation of the revisionist line. The Soviet revisionist writers, in turn, extolled the "20th, 22nd, and 23rd Congresses of the CPSU" at the meeting, praising the revisionist leadership's line of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union as a "highly effective line."

This conference brazenly opposed the great revolutionary teacher Lenin's proposal that proletarian literature should "serve the millions and millions of laboring people" and should become "a part of the general cause of the proletariat." The various documents, reports, and speeches at the conference obliterated class struggle, opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and instead advocated for being the "mouthpiece of the ideas of peace, creative labor, friendship among peoples, and struggle for human happiness." They talked about "humanism," "modernity," "victory for humanity," "saving humanity from the threat of total annihilation," and "sowing seeds of goodness and love," and so on. Under the black banner of "national culture," they promoted Soviet revisionist literature to further serve the counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique.

To encourage Soviet revisionist writers to continue down the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary path, this conference elevated some notorious capitalism restoration propagandists like Sholokhov and Simonov, along with their works, as "examples."

This conference also disgustingly praised the decadent poet Yesenin, Akhmatova, and the traitor Pasternak, who were criticized during Stalin's leadership of the Soviet Union, once again rehabilitating these individuals.

This so-called Congress of Soviet Writers was decided to be held as early as 1964, but due to various contradictions that could not be resolved, it had to be postponed again and again until now, when it was barely managed to be held. Despite this, some people "refused to attend," and some people "skipped the meeting." The conference was chaotic and did not look like a proper event at all. To entice Soviet revisionist writers to work harder for the full restoration of capitalism, the Soviet revisionist leadership at this conference heavily promoted material incentives, further elevating the privileged status of the revisionist writers, and strengthened the control of revisionists over the literary front.

The administrative report of the Writers' Union presented at this conference proposed to build "ivory tower" style "creative homes," stating that "on the one hand, they should be more convenient, more comfortable, and more popular, and on the other hand, they should be more profitable." The organizational report of the conference officially announced: "The CPSU Central Committee and the government have agreed to the Writers' Union's request," and plan to build writers' hotels and hospitals in Moscow for them...

This conference also stipulated that in the future, only "professional writers" could join the Soviet Writers' Union. This is to completely exclude all worker and peasant writers, making the Soviet Writers' Union a thoroughly privileged clique that faithfully serves the Soviet revisionist clique.

Through this conference, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique filled the leadership of the Soviet Writers' Union with their most loyal literary lackeys, such as Sholokhov, Simonov, Ehrenburg, Tvardovsky, Voznesensky, Yevtushenko, and others, further strengthening the control of revisionism in the literary circle.

The so-called Congress of Soviet Writers by Soviet revisionist writers was held at a time when the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, which shook the world, had achieved tremendous victories. The Soviet revisionist leadership and a small group of demons in the literary circle were terrified and extremely afraid that the Soviet people would rise up in revolution under the influence of this revolution. At this conference, they let out a few sobs and a few shrill anti-Chinese shouts.

The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in China is awakening new consciousness among the Soviet people and people all over the world, tolling the death knell for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. The flames of proletarian revolution will surely burn fiercely on the soil of the Soviet Union.

    进一步推行修正主义文艺路线　为全面复辟资本主义摇旗呐喊
    苏修召开彻头彻尾的反革命文艺黑会
    据新华社讯　莫斯科消息：勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团精心炮制的所谓苏联作家第四次代表大会，最近已在莫斯科收场。这是一次拚命推行穷途末路的修正主义文艺路线的黑会；是一次彻头彻尾的反革命、反马克思列宁主义、反华的黑会。
    在这次为期六天的大会开幕时，苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金等到场给了大会一份“贺词”，要苏修作家们进一步为贯彻修正主义路线而卖力。苏修御用作家们则在会上大吹苏共“二十大”，“二十二大”和“二十三大”，把苏修领导集团在苏联国内实行资本主义复辟的路线吹作是什么“卓有成效的路线”。
    这次大会猖狂地反对伟大的革命导师列宁所提出的关于无产阶级文学应当“为千千万万劳动人民服务”，应当成为“无产阶级总的事业的一部分”的基本原则。大会的各种文件、报告和发言，抹杀阶级斗争，反对无产阶级专政，而宣扬什么要做“和平、创造性劳动、各国人民之间的友谊和为人类幸福而斗争的思想的喉舌”，大谈什么“人道主义”、“现代性”、“争取人性的胜利”、“使人类免遭总毁灭的威胁”、“播种善良与爱情的种子”等等。他们打着“全民文化”的黑旗，推动苏修文学进一步为勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团的反革命资本主义复辟效劳。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团为了鼓励苏修作家继续沿着反革命修正主义文艺路线滚下去，在这次大会上把一些臭名昭著的资本主义复辟的吹鼓手肖洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫之流及其作品捧出来作“表率”。
    这次大会还肉麻地吹捧在斯大林领导苏联时期曾经受到批判的颓废派诗人叶赛宁、阿赫马托娃和叛徒帕斯捷尔纳克等，再一次为这些人翻案。
    这次所谓苏联作家代表大会是早在一九六四年就决定要召开的，但由于各种矛盾无法处理，不得不一拖再拖，一延再延，直到现在才勉强凑合举行的。尽管如此，对于这次大会，有的人“拒绝参加”，有的人“逃会”。大会开得乱七八糟，根本不象个样子。为了拉拢苏修作家们更卖力地为全面复辟资本主义服务，苏修领导集团在这次会上大搞物质刺激，进一步抬高修正主义作家们养尊处优的特权阶层地位，并加强修正主义者对文艺阵地的控制。
    这次大会上所作的作协行政工作报告，提出要大搞“象牙之塔”式的“创作之家”，要“一方面要使得它们更方便、更舒服，更受欢迎，另一方面也要使之更有利可图”。大会组织工作报告中正式宣布：“苏共中央和政府已答应了作家协会的请求”，准备在莫斯科为作协大兴土木，为他们盖作家旅馆、作家医院……
    这次大会还规定，今后参加苏联作协的，只能是“职业文学家”。这是要把一切工农作家彻底排除在外，使苏联作协成为忠实地为苏修集团服务的彻头彻尾的特权阶层小团体。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团并通过这次大会，把自己的最忠实的御用文人肖洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫、爱伦堡、特瓦尔多夫斯基、沃滋涅克斯基、叶夫图申科之流塞满了苏联作协的领导机构，以进一步加强修正主义在文艺界的统治。
    苏联修正主义文人的这次所谓代表大会，是在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得巨大胜利的情况下召开的。苏修领导集团和文艺界的一小撮牛鬼蛇神胆战心惊，非常害怕苏联人民在这场革命的影响下起来造他们的反。在这次大会上他们发出了几声抽泣、几声凄厉的反华叫嚣。
    史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，正在唤起苏联人民和全世界人民新的觉醒，敲响了帝修反的丧钟。无产阶级革命的烈火，必将在苏联的大地上猛烈燃烧起来。
