The Chinese people are holding high the great red banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, giving us an excellent lesson in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

I have always been concerned about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Although the Brazilian press, directed by American imperialism, has tried every means to slander this great mass movement, they will certainly fail. A proletarian dictatorship country must educate the people, make them proletarian, and carry out a proletarian cultural revolution to consolidate it. I think this great mass movement should continue so that the bourgeois ideology and old habits of the exploiting classes can be eliminated from China.

    中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    中国人民高举马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的红旗，给我们上了出色的马列主义和毛泽东思想课。
    我一直关心中国的无产阶级文化大革命。尽管由美帝国主义指挥的巴西报刊千方百计污蔑这一伟大的群众运动，但他们一定会失败的。一个无产阶级专政的国家，要通过教育人民群众，使他们无产阶级化，并进行无产阶级文化大革命才能巩固。我认为这一伟大的群众运动应该进行下去，以便能够从中国消除资产阶级意识形态和剥削阶级的旧习惯。
