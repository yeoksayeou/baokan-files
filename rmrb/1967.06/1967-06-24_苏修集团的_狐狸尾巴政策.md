The Soviet revisionist clique has revealed its true colors in the recent Middle East events, becoming infamous. Its days are getting harder, so it has to hurriedly patch things up.

In the past few days, it has issued statements like the "Seven-Nation Declaration" and proposed convening emergency sessions of the United Nations. Today, it announces a break in diplomatic relations with Israel, and tomorrow it expresses its willingness to provide military aid to Arab countries. The Soviet revisionist leaders, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny, are running around busily. This group of traitors is putting on these performances merely to cover up their crimes of betraying the Arab people and the people of the world, to maintain their shaky positions, and to prepare for further schemes.

Lenin once pointed out that reactionaries, after committing counter-revolutionary acts, often adopt a "fox-tail policy." That is, like a fox, they use their tails to cover their tracks. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique is also playing this trick.

However, it is impossible to erase the Soviet revisionists' betrayal. At the critical moment when the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys launched an attack, when the Arab people were facing difficulties, what did you do? You were the accomplices of the invaders, the traitors who betrayed the Arab people. The crimes you committed in the Middle East are beyond the reach of the waters of the Mediterranean. Now, you raise your voices, shouting, "I am against the aggressors," "I support the Arab people," thinking that you can play the hero with such cheap performances. How disgusting!

In fact, even now, the Soviet revisionists' farce of fake support is not well-acted. The reactionary nature of the Soviet revisionist clique determines that it always lives in contradiction. To deceive the people, it wants to sing a few popular tunes to increase the stage effect; but it also fears that if it sings too seriously, it will offend the U.S. imperialists and ruin the beautiful dream of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. It talks about being friends with the Arab people, but it thinks about having a honeymoon with Johnson. Therefore, the fox tail is always exposed.

Regarding the various performances of the Soviet revisionist clique, people should not think it is merely ridiculous, nor should they think it is simply despicable. It is beneficial for the Arab people and the people of the world to have a deeper understanding of the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists' fake support is to cover up their true betrayal. After their betrayal is exposed, they need more fake support to carry out greater betrayals. Now, they are putting on a show of friendship with Arab countries and preparing to "aid" Arab countries, all for the purpose of exchanging political capital for dirty deals with U.S. imperialism. Kosygin's recent activities in the United States are new evidence of the global collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To understand the reactionaries, look at their past to know their present; look at their past and present to know their future." For the Soviet revisionist clique, it is the same. Therefore, people must recognize its essence, be vigilant, and not be deceived by it.

### 苏修集团的“狐狸尾巴政策”

    苏修集团的“狐狸尾巴政策”
    在这次中东事件中，苏修叛徒集团原形毕露，声名狼藉。它的日子越来越不好混了，于是不得不急急忙忙地做一番修补的工作。
    十几天来，它一会儿发表什么“七国声明”，一会儿出主意召开什么联合国紧急会议。它今天宣布同以色列“断交”，明天表示要给阿拉伯国家军事“援助”。苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金和波德戈尔内之流，东奔西跑，忙得不可开交。这一伙叛徒，搞了这么一些表演，无非是为了掩盖他们叛卖阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的罪行，维持他们摇摇晃晃的宝座，以便于他们重整旧业，准备再干。
    列宁曾经指出，反动派在干了反革命勾当之后，往往采取“狐狸尾巴政策”。就是说，象狐狸那样用它的尾巴抹平自己的足迹。现在苏修集团，也是在耍弄这一套把戏。
    然而，要想抹掉苏修集团的叛卖行径，这是办不到的。在美帝国主义及其走狗发动进攻的紧要关头，在阿拉伯人民面临困难的时刻，你们干的是什么？你们是彻头彻尾的侵略者的大帮凶，是出卖阿拉伯人民的大叛徒。你们在中东事件中犯下的罪行，是倾地中海之水也冲刷不掉的。现在你们提高嗓门，喊几句“我是反对侵略者的呀”，“我是支持阿拉伯人民的呀”，想用这样廉价的表演来装“好人”，充“好汉”，岂不令人作呕！
    其实，即使在现在，苏修集团这场假支持的丑剧，也是演的不象样子。苏修集团的反动本质决定了，它总是生活在自相矛盾之中。为了欺骗人民，它也想唱几句叫座的台词，增加一点舞台效果；但是又唯恐把这场戏唱得太认真，触犯了美帝国主义，破坏了美苏合作的好梦。它口里讲的是同阿拉伯人民做朋友，心里想的是跟约翰逊度蜜月。因此，狐狸尾巴总是藏不住的。
    对于苏修集团的上述种种表演，人们不要以为未免滑稽，也不要以为实在可恶。须知这对于阿拉伯人民和全世界人民更深刻地认识苏修的反革命面目是有益处的。苏修集团搞假支持，就是为了掩饰它的真出卖。当它的叛卖行径暴露以后，它就需要搞更多的假支持，以便于进行更大的叛卖。它现在装腔作势地向阿拉伯国家表示“友谊”，准备“援助”阿拉伯国家一些东西，仍然是为了换取同美帝国主义进行肮脏交易的政治资本。柯西金最近在美国的活动，就是苏美进行全球性大勾结的新罪证。
    毛主席教导我们：对于反动派，“看它的过去，就可以知道它的现在；看它的过去和现在，就可以知道它的将来。”对苏修集团说来，也正是这样。因此，人们必须认清它的本质，提高警惕，不要上它的当。
