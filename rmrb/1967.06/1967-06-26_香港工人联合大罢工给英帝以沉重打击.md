The Hong Kong Workers' United Strike Deals a Heavy Blow to British Imperialism

The Hong Kong British institutions are in disarray, with many departments paralyzed; the arrogance of British colonial rule has been thoroughly exposed, and the patriotic struggle against British rule has reached a new high.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 25th, the strike by Chinese workers in Hong Kong British institutions and some British-owned enterprises, which began on June 10, has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities. In the 14 days of the united strike up to the 23rd, many Hong Kong British institutions and British-owned enterprises were in chaos, with command and control failing. Economically, British-owned enterprises suffered heavy losses, and the financial situation of the Hong Kong British authorities was also affected. Politically, the strike has greatly undermined the prestige of imperialism and boosted the morale of the patriotic people, dealing a significant blow to the foundations of British reactionary rule and bringing the anti-British struggle to a new height.

This strike by tens of thousands of workers is a new high point in the patriotic struggle of the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon against British rule. The Chinese workers in the Hong Kong British institutions such as the Marine Department, Post Office, Waterworks Department, Public Works Department, and Municipal Hygiene Department, as well as major British-owned enterprises like the Dairy Company, Gas Company, and Star Ferry, have, with their brave and tenacious fighting spirit, launched a new powerful counterattack against British imperialism from within the enemy's ranks. This has caused many Hong Kong British departments to become paralyzed or semi-paralyzed. More than 60 so-called "anti-smuggling ships" and transport ships of the Marine Department have more than 50 ships that have stopped operating, paralyzing the Hong Kong British authorities' maritime transport. The Post Office has a mountain of undelivered mail. The Waterworks Department's repair work has encountered difficulties, and many of the Hong Kong British authorities' water supply restrictions for citizens have been disrupted. The Public Works Department and the Municipal Hygiene Department's electrical and mechanical repairs, road, drainage, and street cleaning work have also been greatly affected, with some completely stopping work. The Dairy Company workers stopped delivering milk and meat to British officials, British capitalists, the U.S. Consulate, British military and police, and Hong Kong British police from the start of the strike. Even the "Governor" David Trench and the "Colonial Secretary" John Cowperthwaite, top officials of the Hong Kong British authorities, could not get milk delivered by workers. The company's three large restaurants also had to stop operating due to the workers' strike. The gas plant can no longer produce gas, and now only uses low-quality oil residue to make up for the shortage. The Star Ferry has ten small ferries that have stopped operating. Despite the Hong Kong British authorities using armed police to escort some of the crew to operate the ships, only three or four small ferries are sluggishly moving back and forth on the water. Internal chaos reigns in all the striking units, with managers blaming each other and at a loss for what to do.

The strike by tens of thousands of workers has caused partial British-owned enterprises to suffer severe economic losses. The Dairy Company has 17,000 pounds of spoiled milk, which the capitalists had to dump into the gutters. 80% of the refrigerated meat worth 20 million dollars has spoiled, with foul-smelling water seeping out. The Star Ferry's daily income has decreased by more than 80% compared to usual. All the striking British-owned enterprises are currently suffering significant losses.

Under the heavy blow of the united strike, the Hong Kong economic crisis has further deepened. Since early May, foreign-owned banks have had deposits withdrawn amounting to more than 10 billion Hong Kong dollars, with the supposedly "most stable" British-owned HSBC seeing more than 8 billion Hong Kong dollars withdrawn. The stock market has repeatedly closed, and even when it reluctantly reopens, despite repeated price drops, there are still very few buyers. The average price of 20 major stocks has fallen by 18%, with a total depreciation of 760 million dollars. Due to residents' lack of confidence in the Hong Kong dollar, the price of gold has soared, with daily sales being four times the usual amount. Real estate, which is a major pillar of Hong Kong British financial income, is currently in a dead market. Capital is flowing out severely, with the current outflow reaching 1 billion dollars. The tourism industry is also in a state of decline, with few tourists, and the Hong Kong British authorities' income has sharply decreased. On the other hand, the Hong Kong British authorities have allocated a large amount of "special allowances" to bribe the police and other "public servants" to fight for them, causing expenditures to increase significantly, and the Hong Kong British financial situation is in disarray. If the strike continues, there may be a financial crisis.

Politically, the arrogance of British colonial rule has been thoroughly exposed, and the true face of the paper tiger has been revealed. Recently, anti-oppression big-character posters, slogans, and leaflets have appeared everywhere in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, in urban and rural areas, on streets and buildings, and even in police stations and barracks. The "Governor" David Trench is cursed every day as an executioner, British officials are called "white pigs," and the crowd shouts "down with the running dogs" when they see the police. The Hong Kong British authorities' "courts" have become platforms for patriotic people to protest and expose the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. The "emergency regulations" issued by the Hong Kong British authorities have been despised, hated, and ridiculed by the patriotic people.

On the other hand, the strike by tens of thousands of workers has brought about new developments in the patriotic struggle against British rule. On the fourth and fifth days of the strike, 20,000 fishermen held a large-scale sea protest march. More than 20 markets in the Hong Kong district, involving five industries such as vegetable, meat, and fruit vendors, held a united strike. More than 20,000 workers in 11 construction industries stopped work for a day. Anti-oppression struggle committees have been established in various industries and regions. The struggle against oppression by farmers, fishermen, and young students has made significant progress. Recently, many anti-oppression struggle committees or combat groups have been established within institutions and schools controlled by the U.S., Britain, and the Kuomintang. The spontaneous anti-oppression donations initiated by the people have currently reached more than 10 million dollars. The broad patriotic people have been further mobilized and organized. A powerful anti-British and anti-oppression army, with the working class as the main force and the participation of various strata of patriotic people, is taking shape. They are following the strategic and tactical thoughts of Chairman Mao on people's war, and are flexibly launching powerful offensives against the Hong Kong British fascist authorities in various regions of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, from political, economic, and cultural aspects.

The working class has been tempered and tested in this sharp struggle, with revolutionary awareness reaching unprecedented heights and combat effectiveness greatly enhanced.

The strike by tens of thousands of workers has fired the first shot in the counterattack against the bloody crimes of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities' suppression of patriotic people in Hong Kong. It has struck down the enemy's arrogance. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of thousands and millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries." The people of Hong Kong are following Chairman Mao's teachings, further organizing and mobilizing themselves. They want to settle accounts with British imperialism's heinous crimes in Hong Kong over more than a hundred years and are ready at any time to respond to the call of the great motherland, to thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism.

    香港工人联合大罢工给英帝以沉重打击
    港英机构指挥失灵，许多部门陷于瘫痪；港英殖民统治的威风被打得落花流水，爱国同胞反英斗争出现新高潮。
    据新华社香港二十五日电　从六月十日开始的港英机构和部分英资企业中国工人举行的万人大罢工，沉重地打击了港英法西斯当局的反动统治。在到二十三日止的十四天联合大罢工中，不少港英机构和英资企业秩序混乱，指挥失灵。经济上，英资企业损失很重，港英当局财政收支也受到影响。政治上，大灭帝国主义威风，大长爱国同胞志气，港英反动统治基础受到重大冲击，反英抗暴斗争出现了新的高涨。
    这次万人联合大罢工，是港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的新高潮。参加这次罢工的海事处、邮政局、水务局、工务局、市政卫生局等港英机构，以及牛奶公司、煤气公司和天星渡轮等主要英资企业的中国工人，以英勇、顽强的战斗精神，从敌人的内部发动对英帝国主义新的强大反击，使得许多港英部门陷于瘫痪或半瘫痪的状态。海事处的六十多艘所谓“缉私船”、运输船，有五十多艘停驶，使港英当局的海上运输陷入瘫痪状态。邮政局积存的邮件堆积如山，送不出去。水务局的维修工程发生困难，港英当局对市民限制供水的许多措施，已被打乱。工务局和市政卫生局所属的电器机械修理、马路、渠务和清道工作也受到很大影响，有些完全停工。牛奶公司工人，在罢工一开始就停止给英国官员、英国资本家、美国领事馆和英国陆、海军官兵、港英警察送牛奶、肉食，连“总督”戴麟趾、“辅政司”祁济时等港英当局数一数二的头子，也喝不上工人送的牛奶。公司所属的三个大餐厅也因工人罢工，被迫停止营业。煤气厂已生产不出煤气，现在只以气质污浊的油渣气滥竽充数。天星渡轮有十艘渡海小轮停航，尽管港英用武装警察押送部分船务人员开船，也只有三、四艘小轮懒洋洋地在海面上来回晃荡。各罢工单位内部一片混乱，主管官员互相埋怨，一筹莫展。
    万人联合大罢工使部分英资企业经济上受到严重的损失。牛奶公司一万七千磅牛奶变坏，资本家只好把它倒到沟渠里，价值两千万元的冷藏肉食已有八成变坏，臭水涔涔外溢。天星渡轮每天的收入，比平常减少八成以上。所有罢工的英资企业，目前都亏损甚大。
    在联合大罢工的沉重打击下，香港经济危机进一步发展。从五月初以来，外资银行被提存款高达十余亿港元，其中被认为“最稳固”的英资汇丰银行就被提取了八亿多港元。股票市场一再停市，勉强开市后尽管一再落价，但买进的仍极少。二十种主要股票平均价下跌百分之十八，共贬值七亿六千万元。由于居民对港币不信任，黄金价格猛涨，日销量为平常的四倍。作为港英财政收入主要支柱的房地产业，目前已成死市。资金外流严重，目前外流资金已达十亿元。旅游业也呈现萧条现象，游客稀少，港英当局的收入锐减。另一方面，港英为了拉拢警察及其他“公务人员”替它卖命，拨出巨额的“特别津贴”，使支出大大增加，港英财政收支计划紊乱，大罢工持续下去，就有可能出现财政上的危机。
    政治上，港英殖民统治的“威风”已被打得落花流水，纸老虎真面目大暴露。港九和新界，市区和农村，街道和建筑物，甚至警署和兵营，最近都普遍出现抗暴大字报、抗暴标语和抗暴传单。“总督”戴麟趾天天被臭骂为刽子手，英国官员被骂为“白皮猪”，群众见到警察就大叫“打倒走狗”。港英当局的“法庭”，成了爱国同胞抗议、揭露港英暴行的讲坛。港英当局颁布的“紧急法令”受到了爱国同胞的蔑视、仇视和鄙视。
    另一方面，万人联合大罢工带动了爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的新发展。在大罢工的第四天和第五天，两万渔民举行了海上大示威游行，香港区二十多个市场的蔬菜、肉类、水果等五种行业的小贩举行了联合大罢市。十一个建筑行业的两万多名工人联合停工一天。各行各业和各地区的反迫害斗争委员会纷纷成立，农民、渔民和青年学生的抗暴斗争有了重大的发展。最近，在一些美、英、蒋匪控制的机构、学校内部，也成立了许多反迫害斗争委员会或战斗小组。群众自动发起的抗暴捐款，数字目前已达一千多万元。广大爱国同胞已经进一步动员起来，组织起来。一支以工人阶级为主力军，有广泛阶层的爱国同胞参加的、浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴大军，正在形成。他们按照伟大领袖毛主席关于人民战争的战略、战术思想，从政治、经济和文化等方面，在香港、九龙、新界的各个地区，机动灵活地对港英法西斯当局发动强大的攻势。
    工人阶级在这场尖锐的斗争中，受到了严峻的锻炼和考验，革命觉悟空前提高，战斗力大大加强。
    万人联合大罢工打响了反击港英法西斯当局镇压香港爱国同胞血腥罪行的第一炮，煞下了敌人的“威风”。我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”香港同胞正按照毛主席的教导，进一步组织起来，动员起来，他们要清算英帝国主义在香港百多年来的滔天罪行，随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，彻底粉碎英帝国主义的反动统治。
