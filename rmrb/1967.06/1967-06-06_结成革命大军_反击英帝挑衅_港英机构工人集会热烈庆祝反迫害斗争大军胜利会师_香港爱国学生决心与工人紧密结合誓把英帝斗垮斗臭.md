Workers from various Hong Kong British institutions, including the "Marine Department Chinese Staff Union," "Civil and Military Medical Workers Union," "Hong Kong Postal Workers Union," and "Water Supplies Department Chinese Staff Union," held a meeting on the evening of June 4 to celebrate the victory of the united front of workers from Hong Kong British institutions in their struggle against persecution. Representatives at the meeting expressed their determination to respond to the call of the great motherland, to mobilize and organize, and to be prepared at any time to smash any provocations by British imperialism.

Representatives spoke passionately about the editorial "Resolutely Counter British Imperialist Provocations" published in the People's Daily on June 3, saying it was the voice of Chairman Mao, a manifestation of the concern and support of the people of the motherland for their compatriots in Hong Kong who are fighting against persecution. With Chairman Mao as our backbone, our struggle against persecution will surely achieve final victory.

Representatives angrily denounced the brutal exploitation and oppression of British imperialism against workers in Hong Kong British institutions, including arbitrary beatings, unjust dismissals, and denial of sick leave. They also condemned the recent series of fascist bloody suppression incidents orchestrated by the Hong Kong British authorities. They said: This is a matter of national hatred and class resentment. Workers in Hong Kong British institutions can no longer endure it. We will join our compatriots in Hong Kong to fight back.

Representatives said: Our compatriots in Hong Kong have already shattered the intimidating aura of the "courts" and prisons of the Hong Kong British authorities in this heroic struggle against persecution. Now, they are trying to suppress the struggle against persecution of our compatriots in Hong Kong and workers in Hong Kong British institutions through a series of fascist "orders" and so-called "civil service discipline." This is absolutely impossible. Let the "orders" and "discipline" of the Hong Kong British authorities go to hell! We workers are armed with Mao Zedong Thought today, and all imperialists are paper tigers in our eyes. The persecution crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities will ultimately backfire.

On June 3, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched armed police in an attempt to remove displays of Mao Zedong Thought and exposés of the bloody suppression crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities from the windows of bookstores, banks, national product companies, cinemas, and other venues in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and to tear down posted big-character posters, slogans, and newspapers. Representatives pointed out that these fascist measures by the Hong Kong British authorities show their determination to be enemies of the Chinese people and our compatriots in Hong Kong to the end. If they want to escalate their persecution of our compatriots in Hong Kong, we will definitely stand firm to the end. Workers in Hong Kong British institutions are already prepared, and as soon as the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of Various Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon gives the order, we will immediately rush to the front lines to resolutely counter any provocations by British imperialism.

The chairman of the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of Various Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon, Yang Guang, called on workers from all sectors to be fully prepared to counter the persecution measures of the Hong Kong British authorities at any time.

The worker representatives present at the meeting were full of spirit and fighting determination. They repeatedly raised their fists and shouted: "Determine to overcome all difficulties and win victory!" "The Hong Kong British will surely fail, and we will surely win!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our great leader Chairman Mao!" The meeting ended victoriously with the majestic song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on June 5, Hong Kong patriotic students held a meeting on June 4, expressing their determination to respond to the call of the motherland, to closely unite with the working class in Hong Kong, and to resolutely fight to overthrow and expose British imperialism!

Students first pointed out that patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, "organize tens of millions of people and mobilize a surging revolutionary army, which is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolutionaries." Currently, the working class has risen, the farmers in the New Territories have risen, and the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of Students in Hong Kong and Kowloon was solemnly established on June 1. Revolutionary students who have long been subjected to the colonial education of the Hong Kong British authorities have achieved great unity, and the anti-British army is growing stronger.

The meeting read the editorial "Resolutely Counter British Imperialist Provocations" published in the People's Daily on June 3. Students enthusiastically cheered, saying, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you have timely provided us with the guidelines for action and the call to battle. You are our closest kin. You support us. Your great thoughts give us boundless strength. All demons and ghosts will be defeated by us. British imperialists have long oppressed our compatriots in Hong Kong to the point of unbearability. Old and new grievances surge in our hearts. As soon as the motherland gives the order, we are willing to contribute everything and vow to make British imperialism smash into pieces against the copper-walled iron fortress of our compatriots in Hong Kong!"

Students at the meeting exposed the heinous crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in long-term colonial education of young students. They said, British imperialists hate patriotic schools that actively spread Mao Zedong Thought and have long been closing, forcing the relocation of, or imposing various restrictions on patriotic schools, attempting to strangle our patriotic education cause and replace it with colonial education of slavery. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: We should care about state affairs. We will follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, take the lead, settle accounts with the heinous crimes committed by British imperialists in Hong Kong for over a hundred years, and smash the reactionary colonial education system of the Hong Kong British authorities. Of all the rules, learning Mao Zedong Thought is the first!

Students also spoke about the heroic deeds of their classmates, alumni, and relatives in fighting against the enemy. Students said, British imperialists thought that the more bloody suppression they carried out, the more our compatriots would be afraid. In fact, the more the Hong Kong British suppress, the more compatriots stand up and become stronger. We will not be intimidated by their fascist suppression. British imperialists will not defy the logic of "creating chaos, failing, creating more chaos, failing more, until they perish."

Students said, the working class has realized their vow in the struggle: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned, and national dignity cannot be insulted." We should learn from them, unite with them, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, conduct more extensive propaganda and mobilization among the masses, create a strong anti-British sentiment, and resolutely counter any provocations by the British. Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely fight this battle to a thorough victory.

On May 21, the Hong Kong British "riot police" beat up tram workers at the North Point Tram Depot in Hong Kong. Tram workers fought back against the enemy and finally drove away the "riot police."

    结成革命大军　反击英帝挑衅
    港英机构工人集会热烈庆祝反迫害斗争大军胜利会师
    香港爱国学生决心与工人紧密结合誓把英帝斗垮斗臭
    新华社香港五日电  港英机构“海事处华员职工会”、“政军医工会”、“香港邮务职工会”和“水务局华人职工会”的工人代表四日晚举行集会，热烈庆祝港英机构工人反迫害斗争大军的胜利会师。会上工人代表纷纷表示，坚决响应伟大祖国的号召，进一步动员起来，组织起来，随时准备粉碎英帝国主义的任何挑衅。
    代表们在谈到三日《人民日报》《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》的社论时激动地说，这是毛主席的声音，是祖国人民对正在坚持反迫害斗争的香港同胞的无限关怀和大力支持。我们有毛主席他老人家作我们的靠山，我们的反迫害斗争一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    代表们怀着无比愤怒的心情控诉了英帝国主义对港英机构工人任意拳打脚踢、无理开除、有病不准请假等残酷剥削和压迫的罪行；控诉了港英当局最近精心炮制的一连串法西斯血腥镇压事件。他们说：这是民族仇，阶级恨，港英机构工人已经忍无可忍，我们要同香港同胞一起造它的反。
    代表们说：香港同胞在这次英勇的反迫害斗争中，早已把港英当局的“法庭”、监狱的吓人威风打掉。现在，它又想通过左一条法西斯“法令”，右一条法西斯“法令”，并用所谓“公务员纪律”来压制香港同胞和港英机构的工人的反迫害斗争，这是一千个办不到，一万个办不到的。让港英当局的“法令”、“纪律”统统见鬼去吧！我们工人今天用毛泽东思想武装起来，所有帝国主义在我们眼里都是纸老虎。港英当局的迫害罪行最终只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    港英当局三日派出武装警察，企图拆除港九爱国书店、银行、国货公司、电影院和其他场合宣传毛泽东思想以及展示揭露港英血腥镇压罪行的图片和文字的橱窗，撕去张贴的大字报、标语和报纸。代表们指出，港英当局这种法西斯措施，是决心与中国人民为敌、与香港同胞为敌到底。它要把对香港同胞的迫害再“升级”，我们就要坚决奉陪到底。港英机构工人已经准备好了，只要港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会一声令下，我们就立即奔赴前线，坚决反击英帝国主义的任何挑衅。
    港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会主任杨光在讲话中号召各业工人作好一切准备，随时准备反击港英当局的迫害措施。
    出席大会的工人代表意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“港英必败，我们必胜！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”大会在雄壮的《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
    据新华社香港五日电香港爱国学生四日举行大会，表示坚决响应祖国的号召，与香港工人阶级紧密地结合起来，誓把英帝国主义斗垮，斗臭！
    同学们首先指出，港九爱国同胞遵照毛主席的教导：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”目前，工人阶级起来了，新界的农民起来了，港九学生界反迫害斗争委员会也于六月一日庄严宣告成立，长期以来受港英当局施行奴化教育的革命同学实行了大联合，抗英的大军日益壮大了。
    大会宣读了《人民日报》三日社论《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》，同学们热烈欢呼，他们说，毛主席呀毛主席，您给我们及时送来了行动的纲领，战斗的号召，您是我们最亲的亲人。您为我们撑腰。您的伟大思想给了我们无穷的力量，一切妖魔鬼怪都将被我们斗得威风扫地。英帝国主义者长期以来对香港同胞的压迫已经到了忍无可忍的地步，新仇旧恨，涌上心头，只要祖国一声令下，我们愿意贡献出一切，誓叫英帝国主义在香港同胞的铜墙铁壁面前碰得粉身碎骨！
    同学们在大会上揭露了港英当局长期以来对青少年学生施行奴化教育的滔天罪行。他们说，英帝国主义对积极传播毛泽东思想的爱国学校恨之入骨，多年来不断对爱国学校进行封闭、逼迁或诸多限制，妄图扼杀我爱国教育事业，而代之以殖民统治的奴化教育。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：要关心国家大事。我们要遵照毛主席的教导，一马当先，清算英帝国主义一百多年来在香港犯下的滔天罪行，砸烂港英当局反动的奴化教育制度。千条万条，学习毛泽东思想是第一条！
    同学们还纷纷发言谈到他们的同学、校友、亲人同敌人作斗争的英勇事迹。同学们说，英帝国主义以为越是血腥镇压，我们的同胞就越害怕，其实港英越是镇压，站起来的同胞也就越多，越坚强，我们决不会被他们的法西斯镇压所吓倒。英帝国主义决不会违背“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”这个逻辑的。
    同学们说，工人阶级在斗争中用自己的行动实现了他们的誓言：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢，民族尊严不可侮。我们要向他们学习，和他们结合起来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，向群众进行更广泛的宣传和动员，大造英帝国主义的反，坚决反击英帝的任何挑衅。用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九同胞一定要把这一场斗争进行到彻底胜利。
