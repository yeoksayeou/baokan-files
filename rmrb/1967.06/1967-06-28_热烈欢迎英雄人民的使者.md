In the midst of the decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, we warmly welcome our close comrades from the Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe who have come to visit and perform in China. We extend our heartiest greetings to you.

Dear comrades! You come from the front lines of the fierce anti-American struggle in Vietnam. There, 14 million people in the 170,000 square kilometers of South Vietnam are fighting against more than a million American aggressors and their puppet forces, achieving greater and greater victories. This has set a brilliant example for all oppressed peoples and revolutionary people around the world in their struggle against American imperialism. You are the envoys of the heroic people, bringing us the fighting friendship and the unshakable belief in victory against the American aggressors from the people of South Vietnam.

Now, the American aggressors in South Vietnam are already mired in the vast ocean of people's war. Meanwhile, the Soviet revisionist clique is acting as an accomplice to American imperialism, conspiring to betray the Vietnamese people, fully exposing their traitorous nature, and making the revolutionary people of the world more clearly see the truth that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism.

China and Vietnam are friendly neighbors connected by mountains and rivers. The Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are close brothers. The powerful People's Liberation Army of China and the brave Vietnam People's Army and South Vietnam Liberation Army are forever comrades-in-arms fighting side by side. We will forever stand together with our heroic Vietnamese comrades, fight together, and win together!

Comrades of the Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe! The flames of the anti-American struggle have solidified your proletarian revolutionary stance and honed your exquisite artistry; the fiery battle life is your inexhaustible source of creation. Your visit and performance are a rare opportunity for us to learn. We will learn from your brilliant performance the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, learn your heroic demeanor of firmly fighting on the front lines of the struggle, and learn your revolutionary actions of deeply integrating with the masses to serve the just war of anti-American and national salvation.

At present, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a critical moment of decisive battle. We will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, thoroughly defeat them, and thoroughly eliminate their poison in the literary and artistic circles and sports circles. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time and unconditionally, throw ourselves into the fiery struggle, reform our thoughts, and strive to create new proletarian literature and art that is worthy of the great era of Mao Zedong, so that the glorious images of workers, peasants, and soldiers will forever occupy the revolutionary stage of the proletariat.

    热烈欢迎英雄人民的使者
    陆海空驻京部队无产阶级革命派  文体战士联合演出委员会
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，我们亲密的越南南方解放军歌舞团的战友们前来我国访问演出，我们表示最热烈的欢迎。
    亲爱的战友们！你们来自战火纷飞的抗美斗争最前线。在那里，一千四百万越南南方人民，在十七万平方公里的土地上，抗击着一百多万美国侵略军及其傀儡军，取得了越来越大的胜利，对于一切被压迫民族和全世界革命人民的反美斗争，树立了光辉的榜样。你们是英雄人民的使者，给我们带来了越南南方人民的战斗友谊和抗击美国侵略者的必胜信念。
    现在，美国侵略者在越南南方战场上，已经陷入人民战争的汪洋大海。而苏修集团却充当美帝国主义的帮凶，阴谋出卖越南人民，彻底暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸，使全世界革命人民更加认清了反帝必须反修的真理。
    中国和越南是山水相连的友好邻邦。中国人民和越南人民是亲密的兄弟。强大的中国人民解放军和英勇的越南人民军、南越解放军，永远是并肩战斗的战友。我们永远和英雄的越南战友们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    越南南方解放军歌舞团的同志们！抗美救国斗争的战火，坚定了你们的无产阶级的革命立场，锤炼了你们的精湛的艺术；火热的战斗生活，正是你们取之不尽的创作源泉。你们的访问演出，是我们的一次难得的学习机会。我们将从你们的精彩演出中，学习越南南方人民和解放军战士敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，学习你们坚定地战斗在斗争第一线的英雄气概，学习你们深入群众，为抗美救国的正义战争服务的革命行动。
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命进入大决战的关键时刻，我们一定更高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，彻底打倒他们，彻底肃清他们在文艺界、体育界的流毒。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，长期地无条件地到工农兵群众中去，投入到火热的斗争中去，改造思想，努力创作无愧于伟大的毛泽东时代的无产阶级新文艺，让光辉的工农兵形象永远占领无产阶级的革命舞台。
