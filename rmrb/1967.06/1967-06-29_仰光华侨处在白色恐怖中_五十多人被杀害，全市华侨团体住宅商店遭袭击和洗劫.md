Rangoon, June 28 (New China News Agency) — The reactionary government of Burma continues to incite mobs to carry out fascist atrocities against the Chinese, plunging the city of Rangoon into a reign of white terror. Armed mobs are rampaging through the streets, attacking and looting Chinese residences and businesses. According to incomplete statistics, from the evening of June 26 to June 27, more than fifty Chinese and students were killed by the mobs, with countless others injured. This is yet another bloody debt owed by the Burmese reactionary government to the Chinese people.

At 4 PM on June 27, approximately 300 mobsters armed with iron-studded clubs, knives, and other weapons attacked the Chinese Teachers' Association. Twenty-seven Chinese teachers and students (nine men and eighteen women) were brutally beaten to death on the spot.

Currently, Rangoon remains under white terror, with the lives and property of the Chinese having no guarantee of safety. Under the incitement and connivance of the Burmese reactionary government, mobs are attacking and beating any Chinese they see wearing long pants or carrying Chairman Mao's portrait. Chinese organizations, residences, and shops continue to be targeted for attacks and looting. On June 25, 391 former Chinese middle school students, who were allegedly moved to a so-called "safe area" by the Burmese reactionary government, have remained missing to this day.

The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, are the strong backing of the overseas Chinese. Blood debts must be repaid in blood! The Burmese reactionary government has gone too far. In the end, they will only end up "lifting a rock to drop it on their own feet."

    仰光华侨处在白色恐怖中
    五十多人被杀害，全市华侨团体住宅商店遭袭击和洗劫
    新华社二十八日讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府继续唆使暴徒疯狂地进行反华排华的法西斯暴行，仰光市内笼罩着一片白色恐怖，大批暴徒到处对华侨行凶和洗劫。据不完全的统计，从二十六日晚到二十七日止，有五十多名华侨和学生被暴徒杀害，被打伤的不计其数。这是缅甸反动当局欠下中国人民的又一笔血债。
    二十七日下午四时，约三百名暴徒手拿带有铁钉的木棍、匕首、铁器等凶器，袭击华侨教师联合会。华侨教师、学生二十七人（其中男九人，女十八人）当场被活活地打死。
    现在，仰光仍处在白色恐怖中，华侨的生命财产，已经完全没有保障。在缅甸反动政府的唆使和纵容下，暴徒们在全市见到穿长裤、佩带毛主席像章的华侨就行凶、殴打。华侨团体、住宅、店铺继续遭到袭击和洗劫。二十五日，被缅甸反动当局在转移到所谓“安全地带”的借口下逮捕的三百九十一名原华侨中学学生，至今下落不明。
    中国人民不是好惹的，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是华侨的强大靠山。血债必须用血来偿还！缅甸反动政府已经走得够远了，到头来，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
