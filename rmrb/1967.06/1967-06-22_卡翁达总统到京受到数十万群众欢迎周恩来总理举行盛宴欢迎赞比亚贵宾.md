According to a Xinhua News Agency report on June 21, President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Beijing today by special plane. He was greeted by tens of thousands of revolutionary masses from various sectors of the capital, who lined the streets to welcome him. Premier Zhou Enlai and other leading comrades, including Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Deng Yingchao, Guo Moruo, and Liu Ningyi, went to the airport to welcome him and attended the banquet.

Today, Beijing was filled with a spirit of unity and struggle between Asian and African peoples. The skies over the capital airport and the East and West Chang'an Streets were adorned with the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Zambia, along with countless red flags waving in the wind. Slogans and revolutionary songs echoed through the air. The revolutionary masses of the capital held up red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, raised portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, and held up portraits of President Kaunda, welcoming their friends from Zambia, who are on the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle in Central and Southern Africa.

At 5:30 PM, President Kaunda and his wife stepped off the special plane to the sound of drums and gongs. Premier Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, and other responsible comrades walked forward to extend a warm welcome to their Zambian friends. A group of Red Guards rushed forward to present President Kaunda and all the Zambian friends with copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations and recited Mao's words: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories and extend warm sympathy and support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles."

Accompanying President Kaunda on his visit to China were Zambia's Minister of Agriculture Mudenda, Minister of Co-operation, Youth, and Social Development Haydon Banda, Minister of State for Central Province Monga, Assistant Minister of State for Western Province Chalikulima, Permanent Secretary of the Office of the President and Vice Secretary of the Cabinet Simbomji, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jona, Chief Private Secretary to the President Ngoma, and Under Secretary of the Ministry of Co-operation, Youth, and Social Development Chisanga, among others. The delegation consisted of 34 people in total.

After the national anthems of Zambia and China were played, President Kaunda, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, inspected a guard of honor composed of soldiers from the army, navy, air force, militia, and Red Guards.

When President Kaunda appeared before the welcoming crowd, cheers erupted from the crowd. People waved copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations and shouted: "Welcome, President Kaunda!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia!" "Firmly support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist struggles of the African peoples!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live the unity of Asian and African peoples!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" This demonstrated the high political enthusiasm and lofty internationalism of the Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the airport, President Kaunda met with responsible comrades from relevant departments of the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and people's organizations, including Luo Guibo, Wang Shusheng, Zhang Zhirou, Lin Haiyun, Nie Yuanzi, and others. The Zambian friends also met with representatives from various revolutionary organizations: Xia Yishan from the Foreign Ministry Revolutionary Liaison Station, Zhang Ben from the State Science and Technology Commission Revolutionary Committee, Wang Laomin from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Deng Wanti from the Farmers' Congress, Han Aijing from the Red Guards of colleges and universities, and Li Dongmin from the Red Guards of middle schools. Various foreign envoys in China also welcomed President Kaunda at the airport.

After receiving flowers at the airport, President Kaunda and his entourage, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, boarded a car and entered the city. The streets were lined with red flags, countless red Mao Zedong Quotations boards, and red banners hanging across the streets, creating a vast red river that stretched from Dongdan to the western suburbs, nearly twenty miles long, leading to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

President Kaunda, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, rode in an open car to Tiananmen Square, where a large group of revolutionary performers from the PLA's cultural troops in Beijing, the Red Guards of middle schools, and other revolutionary cultural groups performed new revolutionary songs and dances created during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

As President Kaunda, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, rode through the streets to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, cheers, slogans, and drumbeats echoed wherever they went. The revolutionary masses of the capital expressed their ardent support for the fighting peoples of Africa and their fighting friendship with the Zambian people.

The Zambian government economic and technical cooperation delegation, led by Finance Minister Arthur Wina, who is currently visiting China, also went to the airport to welcome President Kaunda. China's Ambassador to Zambia, Qin Lize, and the responsible comrade from the Protocol Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied President Kaunda to Beijing today.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Rawalpindi on June 21, President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia and his entourage concluded their four-day visit to Pakistan and departed from there in the morning on June 21 to Beijing for a state visit.

Pakistan's President Ayub Khan, high-ranking military and political officials, prominent figures from various sectors, and foreign diplomats went to the airport to see off the Zambian president. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, Xu Ying, also went to the airport to see off the delegation.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on June 21, Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia and his wife, as well as the entire Zambian delegation.

He said that at a time when our country's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, President Kaunda and his wife have come to China for a friendly visit, bringing new friendship from the people of Zambia and Africa. Premier Zhou, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and in his personal capacity, expressed heartfelt thanks and warm welcome to President Kaunda and his wife, as well as all the Zambian friends.

Premier Zhou pointed out that since the establishment of the Republic of Zambia, it has achieved remarkable results in consolidating national independence; in international affairs, Zambia pursues a non-aligned foreign policy, opposes imperialism, old and new colonialism, and racism, opposes the colonial regime of Rhodesia, and supports the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe and their African brothers to maintain national independence.

Premier Zhou solemnly declared: The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggles of the people of Zambia and Zimbabwe. He said, We are convinced that the colonial regime of Rhodesia, which is backed by U.S. and British imperialism, will definitely be overthrown, and the final victory will belong to the people of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

In his speech, Premier Zhou strongly condemned U.S. imperialism colluding with British imperialism and Soviet revisionism to instigate and support Israel's large-scale aggression against the Arab countries of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan. He said, The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people. We believe that as long as the Arab people unite and persevere in their long-term struggle, victory will belong to the Arab people.

Premier Zhou enthusiastically praised the great victories of strategic significance achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that can be defeated. He said, No matter how many levels of aggression the U.S. imperialists raise their war of aggression to, and no matter how wide a scope they expand it to, the Chinese people are determined to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end.

In his speech, Premier Zhou enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia.

President Kaunda spoke at the banquet (full text to be published separately). He expressed his deep and sincere thanks for the grand reception given to the delegation by the Chinese people.

President Kaunda warmly congratulated China on the success of its hydrogen bomb test. He said, The great success of China's hydrogen bomb test is a great achievement of a great country, and it has brought China's role in maintaining world peace and security into a new era.

When talking about the Vietnam issue, President Kaunda said, We strongly believe that just as Zambia belongs to us, Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people. No powerful country in the world can expect to conquer the Vietnamese people. Those who wage war in Vietnam to oppress the Vietnamese people must know that the Vietnamese people, like the Chinese people, have a long history of resisting all imperialist and colonialist exploitation. He said, The Vietnamese people will definitely win.

When talking about the Middle East issue, he said, There is no doubt that the Arab people will ultimately win a decisive victory.

President Kaunda concluded by saying, Although China and Zambia are separated by vast land, seas, and skies, our two peoples are getting to know each other.

Attending the banquet were also Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin and Li Siguang, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo and Xu Yixin, responsible comrades from other government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary mass organizations, and representatives from various sectors.

Invited to the banquet were also envoys from various countries in China and friends from African countries working in Beijing.
