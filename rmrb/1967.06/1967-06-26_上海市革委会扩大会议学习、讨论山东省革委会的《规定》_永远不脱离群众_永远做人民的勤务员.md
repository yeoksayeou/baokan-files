On June 23, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an enlarged meeting to enthusiastically discuss and study the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee." The meeting also passed the decision to "Resolutely Study and Implement the 'Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee.'"

After the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" was published in the newspaper, it sparked a strong response in Shanghai. Many revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations immediately organized to read the newspaper carefully and conducted heated discussions. The municipal revolutionary committee specially convened an enlarged meeting for study and discussion. Many revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations unanimously agreed during the study that this is a document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The ten measures proposed in the document are not minor matters of personal conduct but major political principles. It timely proposes measures to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. These regulations and the article by the commentator of the "Red Flag" magazine embody Chairman Mao's consistent teachings to the Party cadres. They are not only completely applicable to Shanghai but also urgently needed. Many comrades in their speeches firmly stated that they must study earnestly with the spirit of rectification and implement these regulations without any compromise.

At the enlarged meeting that day, all attendees used the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" to compare with the actual situation of the municipal revolutionary committee and its subordinate revolutionary mass organizations. They conducted criticism and self-criticism on issues such as connecting with the masses, collective leadership, participating in physical labor, and saving for the revolution.

Through the discussion, the gaps were identified. The members of the municipal revolutionary committee and the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations expressed their confidence and determination: they must catch up with the trend, seriously lead the way in studying the "Several Regulations" of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the article by the commentator of the "Red Flag" magazine, and implement the regulations and instructions of these two documents without any compromise. They will also combine the study of these two documents with the active application of Chairman Mao's works, determined to make new contributions in the new situation and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from one victory to another.

Everyone expressed that they must always maintain the fine style of hard work and simplicity, always not leave labor, always not leave the masses, and resolutely build the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee into a highly revolutionary and combat-ready proletarian command center. The attendees also expressed that they must not only set an example by studying and implementing these two documents earnestly but also actively promote the leaders of revolutionary committees or revolutionary mass organizations at various departments and grassroots units to study and implement these two documents. They must link the spirit of these two documents to carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote their own revolutionization in ideology, work, style, and life, and become loyal servants of the people. They must continuously make new contributions and achievements for the proletarian revolutionary cause and the people.

Timely study, rapid implementation, and resolute action have become the common wish and unanimous requirement of everyone. The meeting finally unanimously passed the decision of the municipal revolutionary committee to "Resolutely Study and Implement the 'Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee.'"
