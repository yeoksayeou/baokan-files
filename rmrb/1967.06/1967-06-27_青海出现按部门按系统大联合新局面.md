	Mao Zedong Thought as the Foundation, Revolutionary Leftists as the Core
	Qinghai Sees a New Phase of Great Unity by Department and System

	In the critical moment of the decisive struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and in the high tide of criticizing the top party personnel who are taking the capitalist road, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Qinghai, with "August 18" as the main body, have achieved a new phase of revolutionary great unity by department and system under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In recent days, the Red Rebel Command Headquarters of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, the "August 18" Red Guards Combat Team of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee, and ten other revolutionary mass organizations have jointly established the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebel Joint Committee of the Party, Government, and Masses Systems in Qinghai Province. More than forty revolutionary mass organizations from the public security, court, and procuratorate systems of Qinghai Province and Xining City have jointly established the Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Political and Legal Front in Qinghai Province. Eleven revolutionary mass organizations from the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and meteorological systems have jointly established the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebel Joint Committee of the Agricultural and Pastoral Systems in Qinghai Province. Seven units from the commercial, foreign trade, grain, and banking systems have jointly established the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebel Joint Committee of the Financial and Commercial Systems in Qinghai Province. The realization of these systemic revolutionary great unities is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It sets an example for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in other systems and has greatly promoted the great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" of the proletarian revolutionaries throughout the province in the great criticism.

	These systemic great unities are revolutionary great unities united under Mao Zedong Thought and are revolutionary great unities with the leftists as the core. Therefore, they have received strong support from the local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army. Responsible comrades from the Qinghai Military Region and the garrison troops attended their joint conferences, firmly supporting them and vowing to be their strong rear guard. The army also participated in their parade celebrating the victory of the great unity. Their great unity has also received strong support and praise from the proletarian revolutionaries in various systems.

	The proletarian revolutionaries in the Party, Government, and Masses Systems, the Political and Legal Front, the Agricultural and Pastoral Systems, and the Financial and Commercial Systems in Qinghai Province, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao to "organize tens of millions of people and mobilize a surging revolutionary army, which is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution," deeply feel that the proletarian revolutionaries have come together for a common revolutionary goal, and the top party personnel who are taking the capitalist road are the common enemy of the proletarian revolutionaries. They said: "To overthrow the Khrushchev of China, to cut off his claws reaching Qinghai, and to root out all the big and small party personnel taking the capitalist road, we must unite all possible forces and achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries." Therefore, before the great unity, they used the method of open rectification to resolutely launch an attack on the "private" character that hinders the great unity, strongly opposing and criticizing anarchism, individualism, small-groupism, sectarianism, and factionalism, and not allowing non-proletarian thoughts to hinder the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." In this way, various revolutionary mass organizations adopted an equal attitude and consultative methods, prioritizing revolutionary interests, seeking common ground while reserving differences, solving specific problems in the great unity, removing ideological obstacles, and successfully achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries by department and system.

	After these systemic proletarian revolutionaries united, they more concentratedly, accurately, and powerfully launched a great exposure, accusation, criticism, and struggle against the top party personnel who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Qinghai. They held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, took up the pen as a sword, and directly struck at the handful of party personnel who are taking the capitalist road, exposing one by one the class enemies hidden in these systems and departments, and thoroughly criticizing them politically, theoretically, and ideologically. In this way, they raised the revolutionary struggle to a higher level, fully demonstrating the great power of the proletarian revolutionaries uniting to fight.

    毛泽东思想为基础  革命左派为核心
    青海出现按部门按系统大联合新局面
    革命派在大联合前开门整风，向妨碍大联合的“私”字开火；大联合后，更有力地对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人展开大批判。
    新华社西宁二十六日电　在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判的高潮中，青海省以“八·一八”为主体的无产阶级革命派各路大军，在毛泽东思想的基础上，出现了按部门、按系统实行革命大联合的新局面。
    最近以来，已由青海省委机关红色造反者联合指挥部、青海省人委“八·一八”红卫战斗团等十个革命群众组织，联合成立了青海省党政群系统“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会；由青海省、西宁市公安、法院、检察院系统四十多个革命群众组织，联合成立了青海省政法战线革命造反派委员会；由青海省农林、牧畜、水利、气象等十一个革命群众组织，联合成立了青海省农牧系统“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会；由青海省商业、外贸、粮食、银行等七个单位的各革命群众组织，联合成立了青海省财贸系统“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会。这些系统革命大联合的实现，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！它给其他系统无产阶级革命派的大联合作出了榜样，对全省无产阶级革命派在大批判中实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”起了很大的促进作用。
    这些系统的大联合，是用毛泽东思想统一起来的革命大联合，是以左派为核心的革命大联合。因此，得到了人民解放军当地驻军的大力支持。青海省军区和驻军负责人参加了他们的联合大会，毫不含糊地坚决支持，誓作他们的坚强后盾。解放军还参加了他们庆祝大联合胜利的游行。他们的大联合，也得到了各系统无产阶级革命派的大力支持和赞扬。
    青海省党政群、政法、农牧、财贸系统的无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”的伟大教导，深刻感到，无产阶级革命派是为了一个共同的革命目标走到一起来的，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是无产阶级革命派的共同敌人。他们说：“要打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，斩断他伸向青海的魔爪，把党内大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，就必须团结一切可以团结的力量，实行无产阶级革命派的大联合”。因此，他们在大联合以前，用开门整风的方法，坚决向妨碍大联合的“私”字开火，大反特反无政府主义，个人主义，小团体主义，山头主义和宗派主义，决不让非无产阶级的思想，妨碍革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。这样，各革命群众组织就采取平等的态度，协商的方法，以革命利益为重，求大同、存小异，解决大联合中的具体问题，扫清了思想障碍，胜利地实现了按部门、按系统的无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    这些系统的无产阶级革命派联合起来以后，更集中、更准确、更有力地对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的代理人，展开了大揭露、大控诉、大批判、大斗争。他们高举革命的批判的旗帜，拿起笔作刀枪，直刺党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把隐藏在这些系统、这些部门的阶级敌人，一个个揪出来，一个个从政治上、理论上、思想上批深、批透、批倒，从而把革命斗争提高到一个更高的水平，充分显示了无产阶级革命派联合起来进行斗争的巨大威力。
