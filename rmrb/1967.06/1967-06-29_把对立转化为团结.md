One day, during a celebration held by the revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Flour Mill and the People's Liberation Army, some students who were not clear about the facts were incited to rush into the venue and even took away the signboard of the "Revolutionary Committee" of the factory. Some workers were very angry and wanted to seize the signboard back, and it seemed that both sides were about to engage in a fight. At this moment, the responsible comrades from the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary committee of the factory immediately went to stop it. They told the revolutionary workers: "We cannot use fists to forcibly seize the signboard back. We should use Mao Zedong Thought to help them, so that they will return the signboard themselves."

Later, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army patiently persuaded and educated the group of deceived students, and together they studied Chairman Mao's teachings. The next day, they indeed came with drums and gongs to return the signboard, and also wrote big-character posters to criticize their own mistakes and expose the people who had instigated them from behind the scenes.

This is a good example of correctly handling internal contradictions among the people with Mao Zedong Thought. On the first day, both sides were about to fight over the signboard, but on the second day, it turned into a scene of unity with drums and gongs returning the signboard.

The reason opposition could be turned into unity is that the responsible comrades of the factory's revolutionary committee and the comrades from the People's Liberation Army were first concerned not with the signboard, but with the deceived masses; they did not use the power of fists to seize the signboard, but used the power of Mao Zedong Thought to win over the masses. As a result, a fight was avoided, the deceived masses awakened, and the signboard was returned.

If the revolutionary committee had only seized the signboard back and not won over the deceived masses, then the deceived masses might have seized the signboard back again. This way of seizing and counter-seizing, causing a big commotion, would harm the masses, and the instigators behind the scenes would be pleased. We must not fall for this trick.

We should learn from the revolutionary committee of the Shanghai Flour Mill and insist on using the method of persuasion and education to handle contradictions with the deceived masses, so that they return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the fundamental method to stop fighting, and it is also the fundamental method to turn opposition into unity.

### 把对立转化为团结

    把对立转化为团结
    一天，上海面粉厂的无产阶级革命派和解放军举行联欢会，有人挑动了一些不明真相的学生去冲会场，把工厂“革命委员会”的牌子也扛走了。有些工人很气愤，要把牌子夺回来，眼看双方就要发生武斗。这时，解放军和这个厂革命派的负责人立即前去制止，对革命派的工人说：我们不能用拳头去硬把牌子夺回来，我们要用毛泽东思想去帮助他们，让他们自己把牌子送回来。
    之后，解放军同志对这群受蒙蔽的学生进行了耐心的说服教育，共同学习了毛主席的教导。第二天，他们果然敲锣打鼓地把牌子送回来了，还写大字报检查了自己的错误，揭发了在背后挑动他们的人。
    这是一个用毛泽东思想正确处理人民内部矛盾的好例。头一天，眼看双方为争夺牌子就要发生武斗，第二天却变成了敲锣打鼓送回牌子的团结场面。
    对立所以能够化为团结，是因为这个工厂革命派的负责同志和解放军同志首先关心的不是那块牌子，而是受蒙蔽的群众；不是用拳头的威力去争夺牌子，而是用毛泽东思想的威力去争取群众。结果，一场武斗避免了，受蒙蔽的群众醒悟了，牌子也送回来了。
    如果革命派只是把牌子争夺过来，不是把受蒙蔽的群众争取过来，那末，受蒙蔽的群众还可能把牌子再争夺过去。这样夺来夺去，大动干戈，吃亏的是群众，高兴的却是那些背后挑动的坏人。我们千万不要上当。
    我们应该象上海面粉厂的革命派那样，坚持用说服教育的方法处理同受蒙蔽群众的矛盾，使他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。这是制止武斗的根本方法，也就是把对立转化为团结的根本方法。
