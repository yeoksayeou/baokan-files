In the wake of the US and UK imperialists colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to support Israel's armed aggression against Arab countries, these three imperialist-revisionist powers are now conspiring behind the scenes to enable Israel to use its occupation of Arab territories as a fait accompli to realize its expansionist ambitions.

According to a report from New York on the 11th, Israeli Defense Minister Dayan, in a speech broadcast on the 11th through the American Columbia Broadcasting Company, arrogantly proposed territorial and other demands: to occupy the entire city of Jerusalem, which was jointly administered by Jordan and Israel before the aggression, as well as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River; to obtain the right to pass through the Suez Canal and the Straits of Tiran. Dayan threatened, "If the Arab countries refuse Israel's demands, it will stay in 'the places it is now in.'"

Israeli Information Minister Gallili even boasted in Jerusalem on the 10th, "Israel cannot return to the armistice agreements of 1949, cannot return to the borders stipulated by those agreements."

According to reports, to seize the territories occupied in the war of aggression, the Israeli cabinet announced on the 11th the establishment of a ministerial-level committee to manage the occupied regions. Ships flying the Israeli flag have begun to pass through the Straits of Tiran. Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities are expelling large numbers of Palestinians from the newly occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.

It must be pointed out that Israel's ability to occupy Arab territories in the war of aggression and to adopt such arrogant and brutal attitudes today is entirely the result of the US and UK imperialists' strong support and the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the Arab countries.

According to a Reuters report from London on the 11th, US and UK imperialists have begun drafting a nine-point plan to support Israel. This plan not only supports Israel's "adjustment" of borders and other demands but also openly stipulates forcing Arab countries to "recognize the existence of the State of Israel" and other provisions to foment Zionism. The plan also lays the groundwork for US and UK imperialists to intervene in Middle Eastern affairs under the banner of the United Nations.

At the same time, the Soviet revisionist leadership is currently closely coordinating with the above-mentioned conspiracies of US and UK imperialists, brewing further betrayals. According to a Western news agency report from London on the 9th, the US, UK, and USSR are engaged in "frequent high-level consultations" on the conspiracy to suppress Arab countries to satisfy Israel's expansionist ambitions. The report states: "There is urgent correspondence at the 'highest level' between Washington, London, and Moscow to pave the way for international actions to be taken after the end of the Middle East fighting." It also says: "The Soviet attitude is 'not uncooperative.'" The facts once again show that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a great traitor to the Arab people and the number one accomplice of US imperialism's aggression against Arab countries.

### 美英苏纵容以色列实现扩张野心  以色列在美英指使和苏修怂恿下提出狂妄要求

    美英苏纵容以色列实现扩张野心
    以色列在美英指使和苏修怂恿下提出狂妄要求
    据新华社十二日讯　在美英帝国主义勾结苏修领导集团，支持以色列发动对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略以后，这三个帝修大国正在幕后进一步勾搭，纵容以色列凭借它在侵略战争中侵入阿拉伯国家领土的既成事实，来实现其扩张主义的野心。
    据纽约十一日消息，以色列国防部长达扬在当天通过美国哥伦比亚电视广播公司发表的讲话中，极为嚣张地提出领土和其它要求：占领在它发动这次侵略前由约旦和以色列分管的整个耶路撒冷城以及加沙地区和约旦西部；取得通过苏伊士运河和蒂朗海峡的权利。达扬威胁说：如果阿拉伯国家拒绝以色列的要求，它就要呆在“现在所呆的地方”。
    以色列新闻部长加利利十日在耶路撒冷甚至跋扈地扬言，“以色列不能回到一九四九年的停战协定上去，不能回到这些协定所规定的边界上去”。
    据报道，为了霸占在侵略战争中侵占的阿拉伯国家领土，以色列内阁已经在十一日宣布成立一个部长级的管理占领地区的委员会。悬着以色列国旗的船只已经开始通过蒂朗海峡。同时，以色列当局在它新占领的约旦河西岸地区大批驱逐巴勒斯坦人。
    必须指出，以色列所以能在侵略战争中侵占阿拉伯国家领土，并在当前采取这种傲慢蛮横的态度，完全是美英帝国主义对它提供大力支持、苏修领导集团出卖阿拉伯国家的结果。
    据合众国际社十一日发自伦敦的一则消息透露，美英帝国主义已经着手拟订一项支持以色列的九点计划。这项计划不仅支持以色列的“调整”边界领土和其它各项要求，还公开作出了强使阿拉伯国家“承认以色列国家的存在”等助长犹太复国主义的规定。计划还为美英帝国主义重新打着联合国的旗号干预中东事务埋下伏笔。
    与此同时，苏修领导集团目前正在紧密配合美英帝国主义的上述阴谋活动酝酿着进一步的大出卖。据西方通讯社九日发自伦敦的一则消息透露，美英苏正在就当前的压迫阿拉伯国家来满足以色列扩张主义的阴谋“进行频繁的最高级磋商”。消息说：“华盛顿、伦敦、莫斯科之间正在‘最高一级’来往紧急的函电，以便为中东战斗结束后要采取的国际行动铺平道路。”又说：苏联的态度“不是不合作的”。事实再一次表明，苏修领导集团是出卖阿拉伯人民的大叛徒，是美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的头号帮凶。
