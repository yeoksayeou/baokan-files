Japanese renowned philosopher Matsumura spoke to Chinese journalists recently with revolutionary fervor to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Chairman Mao's epoch-making Marxist-Leninist masterpiece "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." He said: Marx and Engels founded the theory of scientific socialism, Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, and Chairman Mao developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to an entirely new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Matsumura highly praised Chairman Mao for brilliantly and creatively developing Marxism-Leninism in various fields. He was the first to comprehensively, systematically, and deeply analyze the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society. He proposed the wise judgment of correctly distinguishing and correctly handling the two types of contradictions of different natures, and pointed out that contradictions of different natures should be resolved by different methods.

Matsumura said that Chairman Mao's pointing out of this is very important. If enemy contradictions are mistakenly handled as contradictions among the people, the error of right opportunism will be committed; if contradictions among the people are handled as enemy contradictions, the error of "left" opportunism will be committed.

Matsumura said that Chairman Mao taught us that if we cannot correctly handle contradictions among the people, we will not be able to effectively fight the enemy. Matsumura said that Chairman Mao pointed out the principles for handling contradictions among the people, which is Chairman Mao's major contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism theory.

Matsumura said that Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is the development of the viewpoint that Chairman Mao insisted on in "On Contradiction" under new historical conditions. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, Chairman Mao further developed this viewpoint.

Matsumura pointed out that Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" brilliantly, creatively defended, inherited, and developed the Marxism-Leninism theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. It clearly pointed out how the proletariat, after seizing power, can prevent the emergence of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and thus victoriously reach communism. In a word, it clearly pointed out the correct path for the proletariat to transition from socialism to communism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao not only solved this problem in theory but also in practice. This is Chairman Mao's great contribution to Marxism-Leninism theory. Matsumura pointed out that Chairman Mao's work powerfully refuted the attacks of imperialism and proletarian traitors on the socialist system, clarified some erroneous notions that have long existed in the international communist movement, and became a programmatic document for uniting all revolutionary people to oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership and to advance the international communist movement.

Matsumura reviewed the international background of Chairman Mao's publication of the brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and pointed out that when Khrushchev was stirring up an anti-communist, anti-Marxist-Leninist countercurrent, Chairman Mao published this great work, making a comprehensive, detailed, and scientific analysis of various contradictions in socialist society. Chairman Mao emphasized that under the conditions of socialist society, "the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce." He also said, "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological realm over who will win and who will lose will take a considerable amount of time to resolve." Matsumura pointed out that Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Chairman Mao's other great works are a comprehensive summary of the criticism and struggle against the revisionist line represented by Khrushchev, and a comprehensive summary of the lessons learned from the Soviet Union's transformation from a socialist state under proletarian dictatorship to a state under bourgeois dictatorship.

Matsumura enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao. He said, Chairman Mao is the great leader of the international communist movement, Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and it is increasingly winning the hearts of people around the world.

    毛主席光辉著作发表十周年发表谈话毛主席把马列主义提高到完全崭新的阶段
    文化大革命在理论和实践上解决了无产阶级怎样经过社会主义过渡到共产主义的问题
    据新华社东京二十一日电　日本著名哲学家松村一人为纪念毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义光辉著作发表十周年，最近怀着革命激情向中国记者发表谈话说：马克思和恩格斯创立了科学社会主义的理论，列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，而毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个完全崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    松村高度赞扬毛主席在各个领域中都天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，第一次全面地、系统地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，提出了正确区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的英明论断，并且指出，不同性质的矛盾应当用不同的方法去解决。
    松村说，毛主席指出这一点非常重要。如果把敌我矛盾错误地当作人民内部矛盾处理，就要犯右倾机会主义的错误；如果把人民内部矛盾当作敌我矛盾处理，就要犯“左”倾机会主义的错误。
    松村说，毛主席教导我们，如果不能正确地处理人民内部矛盾，就不可能同敌人进行有效的斗争。松村说，毛主席指出处理人民内部矛盾的原则，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义理论宝库的重大贡献。
    松村说，毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作，是毛主席在《矛盾论》中所坚持的观点在新的历史条件下的发展，而在中国无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席又进一步发展了这一观点。
    松村指出，毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部伟大著作天才地、创造性地捍卫、继承和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，明确地指出了无产阶级在取得政权以后怎样防止产生修正主义、防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，从而胜利地到达共产主义的道路，一句话，就是明确地指出了无产阶级怎样经过社会主义过渡到共产主义的正确道路。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅在理论上，而且在实践上解决了这一问题，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义学说的伟大贡献。松村指出，毛主席的这部著作，有力地粉碎了帝国主义和无产阶级的叛徒们对社会主义制度的攻击，澄清了国际共产主义运动中长期以来存在的一些错误观念，成为团结一切革命人民，反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义，推进国际共产主义运动的纲领性文件。
    松村回顾了毛主席发表《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作的国际背景时指出，正当赫鲁晓夫掀起一股反共、反马克思列宁主义的逆流的时候，毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一伟大著作，对社会主义社会的各种矛盾作了全面地、详尽地、科学地分析。毛主席强调指出，在社会主义社会的条件下，“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”还说，“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”松村指出，毛主席的伟大著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》以及毛主席的其他伟大著作是对以赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义路线的批判和斗争的全面总结，是对苏联从一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家蜕变为资产阶级专政的国家的经验教训的全面总结。
    松村热情称颂伟大的领袖毛主席。他说，毛主席是国际共产主义运动的伟大领袖，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，并且已经在全世界规模越来越深入人心。
