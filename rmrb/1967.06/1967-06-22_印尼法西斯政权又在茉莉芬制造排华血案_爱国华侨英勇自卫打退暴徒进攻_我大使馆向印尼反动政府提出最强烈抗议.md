The Indonesian fascist regime again manufactured a bloody incident against the Chinese in Mojokerto, East Java, on June 13. Armed military police and hooligans attacked the Chinese community, injuring and stabbing more than eighty people. The Chinese community, unarmed, bravely defended themselves and fought back against the armed military police and hooligans for two hours, successfully repelling the fascist attack.

On the morning of June 12, more than a hundred Chinese in Mojokerto went to the local military base to protest the unjust arrest of four innocent Chinese, including Chen Jiabi, on May 22. The base commander, Kasdani, avoided them and sent dozens of fully armed soldiers to threaten and intimidate the protesters with bayonets, attempting to disperse them by force. The Chinese, whose legitimate demands were brutally rejected, remained in the square in front of the base commander's office to continue their protest. By the next morning, the number of protesters had increased to more than three hundred. Despite the threats and deception from the right-wing military police, they read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao, sang revolutionary songs, and chanted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia!" They firmly demanded that base commander Kasdani respond to their demands.

The Mojokerto military authorities not only refused to address the Chinese community's legitimate demands but also, on June 13, mobilized a large number of armed military police to tightly seal off the streets around the base commander's office. They also brought in more than a hundred fully armed soldiers from outside the city to surround the Chinese community. That night, the hooligans hiding around the base commander's office launched a sudden attack on the unarmed Chinese, throwing a large number of stones at them. At this point, the fascist soldiers surrounding the Chinese went berserk, savagely attacking the Chinese with bayonets, gun butts, and military batons. Even a thirteen-year-old child was beaten until he was covered in wounds. The broad masses of patriotic Chinese, unable to bear it any longer, bravely defended themselves and fought back against these fascist thugs.

According to a June 21 report from the New China News Agency, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on June 20, strongly protesting the severe bloodshed incident in Mojokerto, East Java, where more than eighty Chinese were injured and stabbed on June 13, following the brutal persecution of Chinese in Yogyakarta on June 3.

The Chinese Embassy's note pointed out: "The Indonesian government, despite repeated strong protests and serious demands from the Chinese Embassy, has wantonly trampled on international norms and has persecuted the Chinese community to such a cruel extent. Such barbaric persecution of the Chinese community is rarely seen in the history of international relations. We must warn the Indonesian government: the broad masses of Chinese, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are absolutely not to be intimidated or subdued. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The more brutal your racist persecution of the Chinese, the stronger their resistance will be. The seven hundred million Chinese people, who are triumphantly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the just struggle of the broad masses of Chinese against persecution. If you persist in your madness and continue your frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese policies, you will only be 'lifting a rock to drop on your own feet.'"

The note said: "The Chinese Embassy firmly demands that the Indonesian government: immediately publicly apologize for this serious incident; severely punish the perpetrators and instigators; immediately release all detained Chinese; take responsibility for all medical expenses of the injured Chinese; and stop all anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese racist persecutions. Otherwise, the Indonesian government will bear full responsibility for all serious consequences that may arise."

The Chinese Embassy reiterated in the note that it would dispatch a consular official with the necessary personnel to immediately go to Mojokerto to comfort the suffering Chinese and inspect the situation of the Chinese community in various parts of East Java. The Indonesian government should make arrangements for this as soon as possible.

    印尼法西斯政权又在茉莉芬制造排华血案
    爱国华侨英勇自卫打退暴徒进攻
    我大使馆向印尼反动政府提出最强烈抗议
    据新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚法西斯政权十三日在东爪哇茉莉芬市，又制造了一起出动大批武装军警和暴徒袭击华侨，打伤和用刺刀刺伤华侨八十多人的血腥事件。赤手空拳的华侨在受到袭击时，英勇地进行自卫，同全副武装的军警暴徒搏斗两小时之久，打退了法西斯匪徒的进攻。
    十二日上午，茉莉芬市的华侨一百多人，到该市基地司令部进行说理斗争，要求释放在五月二十二日被无理逮捕的无辜华侨陈家碧等四人。基地司令卡斯丹理亏心虚，不敢照面，并且出动数十名全副武装的军人，用刺刀对准华侨，百般恫吓，企图用武力驱散他们。华侨由于他们的正当要求遭到蛮横拒绝，留在基地司令部前面的广场上坚持斗争。到第二天上午，参加斗争的人数增加到三百多人。他们不顾右派武装军警的威吓欺骗，齐声朗读毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲，高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国印尼两国人民友好万岁！”等口号，坚决要求基地司令卡斯丹出来答复他们的要求。
    茉莉芬军事当局不仅顽固地拒不答复华侨的正当要求，在十三日中午竟然出动大批荷枪实弹的军警，严密封锁了基地司令部附近的大街小巷，还从外地调来一百多名全副武装的军人，把华侨层层包围。到当天深夜，埋伏在司令部周围的暴徒疯狂地向手无寸铁的华侨发动突然袭击，向华侨大量投掷石块。这时包围华侨的法西斯军人兽性大发，疯狂地用刺刀、枪托和军棍向华侨发动野蛮进攻，连十三岁的小孩子也被打得遍体鳞伤。广大爱国华侨忍无可忍，英勇地进行自卫反击，同这些法西斯匪徒进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    据新华社二十一日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十日照会印尼外交部，对东爪哇军政当局继六月三日在岩望市制造残酷迫害华侨的暴行之后，十三日又在茉莉芬制造了打伤和刺伤华侨八十多人的严重流血事件，向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国大使馆的照会指出：“印度尼西亚政府不顾中国大使馆一再提出的强烈抗议和严正要求，恣意践踏国际关系准则，对华侨竟蹂躏到如此残酷的地步，迫害华侨竟达到如此野蛮的程度，在国际关系史上实在是罕见的。我们要正告印度尼西亚政府：用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨是绝对吓不倒、压不服的。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。你们对华侨的种族主义迫害愈残暴，他们的反抗就必然愈强烈。正在胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民坚决支持广大华侨反迫害的正义斗争。如果你们一意孤行，继续疯狂反华、排华，只能是‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
    照会说：“中国大使馆坚决要求印度尼西亚政府：就此严重事件立即公开道歉；严惩肇事者和主使人；立即释放全部被捕的华侨；负责受伤华侨的一切医疗费用；停止一切反华、排华的种族主义迫害。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由印度尼西亚政府全部承担。”
    中国大使馆在照会中再次重申，将派领事偕同必要的工作人员，立即前往茉莉芬慰问受难华侨，并到东爪哇各地视察侨情。印尼政府应迅速就此作出安排。
