The Red Guards of our school and all revolutionary teachers and students have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "return to classes and make revolution." In the midst of the revolutionary big criticism, we have achieved a revolutionary great alliance from the bottom up, with revolutionary factions as the core and teaching classes as the foundation, and established the school revolutionary committee.

When we started to return to classes and make revolution, because the bourgeois reactionary line had not been thoroughly criticized, there were deep rifts and strong antagonistic sentiments among students, between teachers and students, and among teachers. Faced with this situation, we first organized revolutionary faction students to study Chairman Mao's works and relevant editorials in newspapers, making everyone realize that the antagonism among the masses was entirely caused by the bourgeois reactionary line. Most of the students who had participated in conservative organizations were our class brothers, and they were also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We should approach them with deep class feelings to win them over and unite with them to jointly attack the bourgeois reactionary line. We held large and small criticism and denunciation meetings, denouncing and criticizing the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party who ruthlessly suppressed the revolution, and criticizing works like "Cultivation of Moral Character." Through the big criticism, the ideological awareness of teachers and students was greatly raised, and many deceived students also stood up to denounce the harm caused by the bourgeois reactionary line. To further unite the majority of comrades ideologically, we also did a lot of painstaking and detailed ideological work. Some revolutionary faction students had mistakenly thought that doing detailed ideological work was "sentimentalism." We organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "The attitude of the Communist Party members towards backward people is not to look down upon them, despise them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." Revolutionary faction students, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively sought out students who had made mistakes, had heart-to-heart talks with them, and studied Chairman Mao's works together. As a result, students who had been deceived and participated in conservative organizations returned to their classes one after another and joined the tide of big criticism.

The rifts and antagonism between students and teachers, as well as among teachers, also hindered the revolutionary great alliance. Revolutionary faction students took the lead in doing work among the teachers. However, some teachers were afraid and did not want to go to the classes. Some teachers had made mistakes in the past and were afraid that the students would not let go of them. Revolutionary faction students, in response to the teachers' active thoughts, sent them Chairman Mao's quotations and held heart-to-heart talks, improving the relationship between revolutionary teachers and students, and gradually establishing revolutionary feelings in the course of joint struggle.

    开展革命大批判　推动复课闹革命
    我校红卫兵和全校革命师生积极响应毛主席“复课闹革命”的伟大号召，在革命的大批判中实现了以革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的自下而上的革命大联合，成立了校革命委员会。
    我们开始复课闹革命时，由于资产阶级反动路线没有得到彻底的批判，学生之间、师生之间、教师之间，隔阂很深，对立情绪还很大。针对这种情况，我们首先组织革命派同学学习毛主席著作和报刊上有关的社论，使大家认识到群众之间的对立完全是资产阶级反动路线造成的，参加过保守组织的同学大多数是自己的阶级兄弟，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，应当带着深厚的阶级感情去争取和团结他们，一道向资产阶级反动路线开火。我们连续召开了大大小小的批判、控诉会，控诉和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂镇压革命的罪行，批判《修养》等。通过大批判，师生们的思想觉悟有了很大提高，许多受蒙蔽的同学也纷纷起来控诉资产阶级反动路线对他们的毒害。为了进一步从思想上把大多数同志团结起来，我们还做了许多艰苦细致的思想工作。革命派同学中有些人曾错误地认为做细致的思想工作是“温情主义”。我们就组织大家带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”革命派同学遵照毛主席的教导，主动地找犯错误的同学，和他们一起谈心，一起学习毛主席著作。结果，受蒙蔽参加保守组织的同学纷纷回到班级，投入到大批判的洪流中。
    同学与教师之间，以及教师之间的隔阂和对立，也妨碍了革命的大联合。革命派同学带头做教师的工作。可是有些教师“怕”字当头，不愿到班级去。有的教师过去有错误，怕同学揪住不放。革命派同学针对教师的活思想，给他们送毛主席语录，和教师开谈心会，使革命师生的关系得到了改善，并逐渐在共同斗争中建立起革命的感情。
