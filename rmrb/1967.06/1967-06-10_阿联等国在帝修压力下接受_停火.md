Egypt and Syria announced on the evening of the 8th and the early morning of the 9th respectively that they accept the United Nations Security Council's "ceasefire resolution." According to reports from Cairo newspapers, the Egyptian representative to the United Nations met with U.N. Secretary-General U Thant in the afternoon of the 8th, delivering a letter from the Egyptian government. The letter stated that the Egyptian government had decided to accept the ceasefire appeal as stipulated in the Security Council's resolutions of June 5 and 6, 1967, on the condition that the other side also ceases fire.

Following Egypt's announcement of accepting the ceasefire, Syria also declared its agreement to the ceasefire. According to a broadcast by Damascus Radio on the morning of the 9th, the Syrian Arab Republic, considering the current situation, had notified U Thant of its acceptance of the ceasefire, with the condition that the other side does the same.

Jordan had already announced its acceptance of the ceasefire on the 7th.

    阿联等国在帝修压力下接受“停火”
    新华社九日讯　阿联和叙利亚在八日晚间和九日凌晨相继宣布接受联合国安全理事会的“停火决议”。据开罗报纸报道，阿联驻联合国代表八日下午奉阿联政府的指示，会见了联合国秘书长吴丹，并交给他一封信。信中说，阿联政府已决定在对方停火的条件下接受安理会在一九六七年六月五日和六日的决议所规定的“停火呼吁”。
    在阿联宣布接受“停火”后数小时，叙利亚也宣布同意“停火”。据大马士革电台九日晨广播说，阿拉伯叙利亚共和国考虑到当前的局势，已经通知吴丹接受“停火”，条件是对方也要这样做。
    约旦早在七日就已经首先宣布接受“停火”。
