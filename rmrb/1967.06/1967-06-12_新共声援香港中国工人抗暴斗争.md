The recent meeting of the National Committee of the New Zealand Communist Party passed a resolution to support the just struggle of Hong Kong Chinese workers against the fascist atrocities of British imperialism.

The resolution states, "Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings, the Hong Kong workers will never be intimidated by the fascist suppression of British imperialism. Their struggle is a common struggle of the oppressed and exploited peoples of all countries against imperialism. Their victory will advance the cause of workers everywhere, including the working class of New Zealand." The resolution emphasizes: "This National Committee meeting calls on all New Zealand workers and democrats to fully support the just struggle of Hong Kong workers against the brutal suppression by the British authorities."
