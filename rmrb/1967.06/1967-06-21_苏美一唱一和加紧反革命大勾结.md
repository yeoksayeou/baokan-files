The Soviet Union and the United States sing the same tune and tighten their counter-revolutionary collusion. Kosygin engages in "direct dialogue" with Johnson at the United Nations, cheering for the U.S. imperialists' "bombing to coerce and stop bombing to deceive" plot. He advocates that the big powers "find a common language" to force Arab countries to accept a humiliating "solution."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 20, New York: On June 19, after the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, delivered a speech in Washington, the head of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Kosygin, immediately followed suit by speaking first at the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting in New York. Kosygin's speech, in harmony with Johnson's, indicates that the Soviet revisionists want to collude with U.S. imperialism on a global scale and help the U.S. continue its plot to further invade Arab countries.

The U.S. television and radio networks had made elaborate arrangements in advance, first broadcasting Johnson's speech and then Kosygin's address, "to start a direct dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States." This "direct dialogue" further proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Kosygin is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and a great traitor to the interests of the people of all countries.

In his speech on June 19, Johnson openly declared that he wanted to "expand the areas of common action with the Soviet Union" on a series of issues including Vietnam, the Middle East, and the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation," and to engage in global-scale deals with the Soviet revisionists. Kosygin immediately responded enthusiastically.

When talking about the Vietnam issue, Kosygin shouted that the continuation of the Vietnam War "breeds the serious danger of turning this conflict into a broad military conflict among the big powers," emphasizing that what the United States "should do first" is to "immediately stop the bombing of North Vietnam," blatantly helping U.S. imperialism to carry out its "bomb to coerce, stop bombing to deceive" plot. Kosygin also promised that the Soviet revisionists would "maintain European peace" to "stabilize" Europe, allowing U.S. imperialism to transfer forces to deal with the people's revolutionary movements in Asia, the Middle East, and other regions.

In his speech, Kosygin extensively propagated Khrushchev's nonsense about how even a "spark" could lead to "nuclear annihilation." Kosygin said that the "nuclear age" has given the issues of war and peace new reality, and the "most worrying problem" is to "prevent war disasters." He claimed that even small incidents or so-called "local wars" could escalate into large-scale military conflicts. Kosygin shouted that every country and government should not only avoid provoking conflicts with their actions but should also make every effort to prevent any escalation of the situation. They must "stop the dangerous development of events" in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and any region where peace is disrupted. Kosygin came out to peddle these black goods of Khrushchev revisionism, which is in line with the global collusion of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, attempting to force the people of all countries to accept "world peace" under the domination of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, allowing U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to run rampant, and not allowing the people of various countries to engage in anti-imperialist struggles, especially not allowing revolutionary armed struggles.

On the Middle East issue, due to the recent exposure of the Soviet revisionists' traitorous face in betraying the interests of the Arab people, the Soviet revisionists hurriedly requested this emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to cover up their actions. However, the speech carefully crafted by Kosygin only made their traitorous face more apparent.

In his speech, Kosygin devoted a large portion to feigning a stance of "condemning" Israeli aggression and wanting to "eliminate" the consequences of Israeli aggression. However, he deliberately avoided mentioning the culprits behind the instigation and participation in the Israeli aggression war, the U.S. and British imperialists.

Kosygin hypocritically expressed "support" for Arab countries, but he did not support Arab countries in their anti-aggression war, nor did he support the measures currently being taken by Arab countries to resist the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel. Kosygin said that the Soviet revisionists had already received information that Israel would launch a sudden attack on Arab countries. What Kosygin did not dare to mention was that it was precisely the Soviet revisionists, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, who, after knowing this situation, used arguments like "restraint" to lull the Arab countries and did not allow them to take anti-aggression self-defense actions. In his speech, Kosygin also openly boasted about how the U.S. and the Soviet Union manipulated the United Nations Security Council to force Arab countries to stop the anti-aggression war and achieve a "ceasefire," claiming it as their "achievement" and "merit."

On the issue of solving the Middle East problem, Kosygin, in step with Johnson, emphasized that Israel has the right to exist as a country, that Israel's demands on its neighboring countries can be resolved through the United Nations in a peaceful manner, and that the important international waterway, the Suez Canal, should be restored to its normal state. Arab countries can "rely on the United Nations for protection" and should not "expand their military forces."

Kosygin also echoed Johnson in advocating that the big powers should "find a common language" and take measures through the United Nations, attempting to impose this humiliating "solution" on Arab countries.

After Kosygin's speech, which fully colluded with U.S. imperialism, it immediately received the approval of U.S. and British imperialism. The U.S. representative Goldberg reiterated Johnson's words at the United Nations General Assembly, wanting to expand common actions with the Soviet revisionists. The British representative Carradyne said that Kosygin's speech showed a "cooperative tendency." The U.S. news agency also said that Kosygin's speech was similar to Johnson's, and Kosygin's tone towards the United States was "mild." This restrained attitude seemed to be clearly aimed at opening the door for a summit meeting with President Johnson.

    苏美一唱一和加紧反革命大勾结
    柯西金在联大同约翰逊“直接对话”，为美帝“停炸诱和”阴谋摇旗呐喊
    鼓吹大国“找到共同语言”迫使阿拉伯国家接受屈辱的“解决方案”
    据新华社二十日讯  纽约消息：六月十九日，美帝国主义头子约翰逊在华盛顿发表演说之后，苏修领导集团头目柯西金紧跟着在纽约联合国大会紧急会议上第一个讲话。柯西金的讲话，同约翰逊一唱一和，表明苏修要同美帝加紧进行全球性的大勾结，要帮助美帝继续推行进一步侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋。
    美国的电视广播网事先特意进行了精心的安排，先转播约翰逊的演说，接着转播柯西金的讲话，“使苏美开始直接对话”。这个“直接对话”更加证明，柯西金之流的苏修领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是叛卖各国人民利益的大叛徒。
    约翰逊在十九日演说中，公开声称要在越南、中东和所谓“防止核扩散”等一系列问题上，“扩大同苏联采取共同行动的领域”，同苏修进行全球性大交易。柯西金马上积极响应。
    柯西金在谈到越南问题时，叫嚷什么“越南战争的继续”“孕育着把这一冲突变成各大国广泛军事冲突的严重危险”，强调美国“首先”要做的仅仅是“立即停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸”，赤裸裸地帮助美帝国主义来推行“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。柯西金还保证苏修要“维护欧洲和平”，以便“稳定”欧洲，让美帝国主义能够转移出力量来对付亚洲、中东及其他地区的人民革命运动。
    柯西金在讲话中大肆宣扬赫鲁晓夫那套“星星之火”都会引起“核毁灭”的战争恫吓滥调。柯西金说什么，“核世纪使战争与和平的问题有了新的现实性”，“最为不安的问题”是“防止战争灾难”，“看来小的事件或是所谓‘局部战争’都可能转为大规模的军事冲突”。柯西金叫嚷，“每个国家和各国政府不仅不应该用自己的行动引起纠葛，而且应该尽一切努力，不让局势有任何尖锐化”，必须“制止在近东、在东南亚、在和平遭到破坏的任何地区的事态的危险发展”。柯西金又出来拚命贩卖赫鲁晓夫修正主义的这些黑货，就是配合美苏全球性的大勾结，企图迫使各国人民接受美苏主宰下的“世界和平”，听任美帝国主义及其走狗横行霸道，而不许各国人民进行反帝斗争，特别不许进行革命武装斗争。
    在中东问题上，由于最近苏修出卖阿拉伯人民利益的叛徒面目大暴露，苏修急急忙忙要求召开这次联大紧急会议，来进行遮掩。但是，柯西金苦心炮制出来的讲话，也只能使得其叛徒面目欲盖弥彰。
    柯西金在讲话中用大量篇幅，装出一副“谴责”以色列侵略、要“消除”以色列侵略后果的姿态，但是他竭力避免提到策动和参与以色列侵略战争的罪魁祸首美英帝国主义。
    柯西金假惺惺地表示“支持”阿拉伯国家，但是他根本不支持阿拉伯国家进行反侵略战争，也不支持阿拉伯国家目前继续抗击美英和以色列侵略者的措施。柯西金说，苏修早就得到消息，以色列要对阿拉伯国家进行突然袭击。而柯西金所不敢提到的是，正是苏修，同美帝国主义串通一气，在知道这个情况后，还配合以色列用“克制”之类的论调来麻痹阿拉伯国家，并且不许阿拉伯国家采取反侵略自卫行动。柯西金在讲话中还公然吹嘘美苏操纵联合国安理会迫使阿拉伯国家停止反侵略战争，实现“停火”，是它们的“成就”和“功劳”。
    在解决中东问题的方案上，柯西金同约翰逊亦步亦趋地强调，以色列“有权”“作为一个国家”存在，“以色列对其邻邦有所要求”可以“到联合国来”“通过和平方式谋求解决”，要改变“重要国际航道”苏伊士运河的“瘫痪”状态，阿拉伯国家可以“指望联合国来保卫”而不要“扩充军备”。
    柯西金还同约翰逊一个腔调，鼓吹要由大国“找到共同语言”，通过联合国“采取措施”，企图把这套使阿拉伯国家丧权辱国的“解决方案”强加于阿拉伯国家身上。
    柯西金这篇同美帝国主义全面勾搭的讲话发表以后，立即得到了美英帝国主义的赞许。美国代表戈德堡在联大会议上重申约翰逊的话，要扩大同苏修采取“共同行动”。英国代表卡拉登说，柯西金讲话显示出“合作的倾向”。美国通讯社也说，柯西金同约翰逊的讲话有“近似之处”，柯西金对美国语气“温和”，“这种克制态度似乎是明显地在为同约翰逊总统举行最高级会谈敞开大门而努力”。
