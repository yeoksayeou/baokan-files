	Never Leave the Masses for a Moment
	*People's Daily* June 24 Editorial

	“Serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses for a moment.” Whether the revolution can succeed and whether it can be consolidated after victory depends, among other things, on whether we follow Chairman Mao’s teaching and maintain close ties with the masses.

	In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai’s revolutionary masses have closely studied Chairman Mao’s works, maintained close ties with the broad revolutionary masses, and achieved great victories in the struggle for power. The current revolutionary situation in Shanghai is excellent. We must cherish this excellent situation. However, we must not be complacent and satisfied with the status quo. Cherishing the excellent situation means further carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion and making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	At present, an important task facing us is how to further study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, maintain close ties with the masses, exercise power well, and use power well to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The class enemy, unwilling to die, is trying every means to corrupt our cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations with bourgeois ideology and style, attempting to disrupt the ties between cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and the masses. This is an important aspect of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. The *Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee’s Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Style* has timely raised this issue and made specific regulations. This document and the editorial in *Red Flag* magazine, *Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology*, are sharp weapons for us to maintain close ties with the masses and fight against the class enemy. They are well worth studying by Shanghai’s revolutionary masses, especially members of various levels of revolutionary committees and leaders of various levels of revolutionary mass organizations. The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee has made a decision on this, and members of various levels of revolutionary committees and leaders of various levels of revolutionary mass organizations should take immediate action to achieve outstanding results in transforming work style and maintaining close ties with the masses.

	To maintain close ties with the masses, we must first unite with them in thought, thinking what they think and worrying about what they worry about. At present, through criticism, promoting revolutionary great unity and the “three-in-one combination,” and doing a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end is the urgent wish of the broad revolutionary masses. A comrade in power who wants to maintain close ties with the masses must fully reflect the revolutionary masses’ continuous revolutionary demands, stand in front of the masses, and lead the masses to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. If we put aside the current struggle tasks and busy ourselves with “internal wars,” personalism, and factionalism, we will inevitably become detached from the masses. We should often go among the masses, struggle with the masses, and be infected with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The masses have boundless enthusiasm for socialism.” Often going among the masses, listening to the masses’ opinions, setting aside some time to personally receive visitors from the masses, personally handling letters from the people, and working with the masses are not minor matters that can be done or not done; they are important ways to unite with the masses in thought.

	To maintain close ties with the masses, we must correctly view the relationship between the individual and the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history.” This is the most fundamental principle of historical materialism. If members of revolutionary committees or leaders of revolutionary mass organizations exaggerate their own role and do not stop others from using large-character posters, photographs, and newspaper reports to praise themselves, but instead feel at ease, it shows that they do not understand this fundamental principle of historical materialism, and if this trend develops, it will inevitably lead to detachment from the masses.

	To maintain close ties with the masses, we must be modest and prudent and be good at listening to different opinions. A revolutionary, after achieving initial revolutionary victories, especially after taking power, if not self-aware, will become arrogant and think he is always right. Some comrades find flattering words pleasant to hear, but find critical opinions unpleasant, and some even find it difficult to be close to comrades who insist on revolutionary rebellion. This is a dangerous sign.

	To maintain close ties with the masses, we must also unite with them in life. Life problems are not minor matters. The bourgeoisie often corrupts revolutionaries starting with life. Once a revolutionary is opened up in life, politics will inevitably follow the wrong path. Shanghai is a city with relatively good material conditions, so it is particularly important to pay attention to hard work and simplicity in life. If one is fond of cars, leather sofas, and the like, there is a danger of being peacefully transformed. In the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries, some leaders lack long-term labor tempering, and some are still fresh out of school, intellectuals who cannot deeply understand the hardships of labor and the difficulty of obtaining food and clothing. These comrades need to pay special attention to guarding this life point and fighting against the class enemy head-on.

	To maintain close ties with the masses, it is necessary to make some regulations in work and life. However, having these regulations alone is not enough; we must also mobilize the masses to supervise members of various levels of revolutionary committees and leaders of various levels of revolutionary mass organizations. Big-character posters, big debates, big speeches, and big criticism are not only weapons for struggling against those in power within the Party who take the capitalist road but also weapons for supervising those in power and preventing the emergence and growth of revisionism. Some units have few big-character posters after seizing power, which is an abnormal phenomenon. We must invigorate our spirits, continue to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, use the four weapons, supervise and help those in power. Those in power should study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, humbly accept the masses’ criticism and supervision, and constantly transform their worldview. Only in this way can those in power and the masses maintain close ties and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    一刻也不脱离群众
    《解放日报》六月二十四日社论
    “全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。革命能不能胜利，胜利了能不能巩固，其关键之一就在于我们能不能遵循毛主席这一教导，紧密地联系群众。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，上海的无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，密切联系广大革命群众，取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。当前，上海的革命形势大好。我们应当十分珍惜这样大好的形势。但是，绝不能沾沾自喜，满足现状。珍惜大好形势，意味着发扬更加旺盛的革命造反精神，为无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
    现在，摆在我们面前的一个重要课题就是如何进一步活学活用毛主席著作，继续密切联系群众，掌好权，用好权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。不甘心死亡的阶级敌人，为了阻挡文化大革命的前进，就千方百计地用资产阶级的思想和作风来腐蚀我们的干部和革命群众组织负责人，企图破坏干部和革命群众组织负责人与群众的联系。这是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个重要方面。《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，及时地提出了这个问题，并作了具体的规定。这个文件和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》，是当前促进我们密切联系群众，与阶级敌人进行斗争的一个锐利武器，很值得上海的无产阶级革命派，特别是各级革命委员会成员和各级革命群众组织负责人认真学习。上海市革命委员会对此已作出决定，各级革命委员会成员和各级革命群众组织负责人，都应该立即行动起来，在转变作风、密切联系群众方面作出显著的成绩。
    要密切联系群众，首先要在思想上和群众打成一片，想群众之所想，急群众之所急。目前，通过大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，是广大革命群众的迫切愿望。一个当权的同志要密切联系群众，就必须充分反映革命群众的这种不断革命的要求，站在群众前面，带领群众把文化大革命进行到底。如果我们把当前的斗争任务放在一边，忙于打“内战”，闹个人主义、小山头主义，那就必然要脱离群众。我们应该经常到群众中去，与群众同斗争，感染群众的革命热情。毛主席教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”经常到群众中去，倾听群众的意见，拿出一定的时间，亲自接待群众来访，亲自处理人民来信，和群众一起参加劳动，这些都不是可做可不做的小事，而是实现在思想上与群众打成一片的重要途径。
    要密切联系群众，必须正确看待个人与群众的关系。毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是历史唯物主义的最根本的原理。革命委员会的领导成员或革命群众组织的负责人如果夸大自己个人的作用，见到别人用大字标语、拍照、登报等办法来宣扬自己也不去劝阻，反而心安理得，那就表明他还不懂得这条历史唯物主义的根本原理，这种风气发展下去，也就必然会造成脱离群众的恶果。
    要密切联系群众，必须谦虚谨慎，善于倾听各种不同的意见。一个革命者在取得革命初步胜利后，特别是当权以后，如果不自觉，那就会骄傲起来，处处自以为是。有的同志对于奉承的话，听起来很舒服，对于那些批评的意见，却感到刺耳，有的甚至对于那些坚持革命造反精神的战友也感到不可亲了，这是很危险的苗头。
    要密切联系群众，还必须在生活上与群众打成一片。生活上的问题，决不是小事。资产阶级腐蚀革命者，往往从生活着手。一个革命者一旦在生活上被打开缺口，政治上就必然要跟着走上歧途。上海是一个物质条件较好的大城市，生活上注意艰苦朴素尤其重要。如果热衷于小汽车、皮沙发之类的东西，那就有被和平演变过去的危险。在无产阶级革命派的队伍中，有部分负责人缺乏长期劳动锻炼，有的还是刚从学校出来的知识分子，他们还不能深刻体会劳动的艰苦和一衣一食的来之不易，这部分同志特别需要注意，把住生活这个关口，和阶级敌人作针锋相对的斗争。
    为了密切联系群众，在工作和生活方面作出若干规定是必要的。但是，单有这些规定还是不够的，还必须发动群众对各级革命委员会成员和各级革命群众组织负责人进行监督。大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，不仅是与党内走资本主义道路当权派作斗争的武器，也是监督当权的同志，防止修正主义产生和滋长的武器。有些单位在夺权后，大字报零零落落，这是一种不正常的现象。我们必须振作精神，继续发扬不断革命的精神，运用四大武器，监督和帮助当权的同志。而当权的同志自己则应该活学活用毛主席著作，虚心接受群众的批评和监督，不断改造自己的世界观。只有这样，才能使当权的同志和群众始终保持密切联系，才能将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
