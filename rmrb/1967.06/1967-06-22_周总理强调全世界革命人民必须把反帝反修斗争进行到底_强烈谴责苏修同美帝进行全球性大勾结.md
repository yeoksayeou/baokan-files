Premier Zhou today strongly denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for actively plotting through the United Nations to engage in a global collusion with the American imperialist bosses, attempting to sell out the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Premier Zhou said, in the process of the American imperialist counter-revolutionary global strategy accelerating its collapse, Soviet revisionism, adapting to the needs of American imperialism, has come forward to give it a big helping hand. Johnson said on June 19 at the National Education Association's foreign policy conference that the United States has made great progress in expanding the scope of joint action with the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been actively working for the American imperialists' "peace talks" plot on the Vietnam issue. In this war of resistance against aggression by the Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has further exposed its true colors of false support and real betrayal of the Arab people.

He said, now, many signs indicate that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is actively plotting through the United Nations to engage in a global collusion with the American imperialist bosses, attempting to sell out the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which must arouse people's serious vigilance.

Premier Zhou emphasized, the practice of struggle has educated the revolutionary people of the world: to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. We must carry out the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States to the end, and we must carry out the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists to the end.

Premier Zhou made these remarks at a banquet welcoming the President of Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda.

    周总理强调全世界革命人民必须把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    强烈谴责苏修同美帝进行全球性大勾结
    新华社二十一日讯  周恩来总理今天强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团正在通过联合国积极策划同美帝国主义头子进行全球性的大勾结，企图出卖越南人民、阿拉伯人民和亚非拉人民的革命利益。
    周总理说，在美帝国主义反革命全球战略加速破产的过程中，苏联修正主义适应美帝国主义的需要，起来大帮其忙，约翰逊六月十九日在全美教育工作者对外政策会议上说，美国扩大同苏联共同行动的领域，已取得了巨大进展。大家知道，苏联修正主义领导集团一直在越南问题上为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。在这次阿拉伯国家的反侵略战争中，苏联修正主义领导集团进一步暴露了它对阿拉伯人民假支持、真出卖的真面目。
    他说，现在，许多迹象表明，苏联修正主义领导集团正在通过联合国积极策划同美帝国主义的头子进行全球性的大勾结，企图出卖越南人民、阿拉伯人民和亚非拉人民的革命利益，必须引起人们的严重警惕。
    周总理强调说，斗争的实践教育了全世界革命人民：反帝必须反修。我们一定要把反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争进行到底，一定要把反对以苏修为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    周总理是在欢迎赞比亚共和国总统卡翁达的宴会上讲这些话的。
