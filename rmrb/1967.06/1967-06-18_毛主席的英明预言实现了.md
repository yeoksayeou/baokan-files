Chairman Mao's wise prediction has come true. The first hydrogen bomb of our country has successfully detonated. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great joy for the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire nation, the people of the entire nation, and the revolutionary people of the entire world. Let us shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever! Let us sincerely wish our most beloved and most red red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

The successful detonation of our country's first hydrogen bomb is another heavy blow to the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and a powerful support to the revolutionary people of the entire world. This great victory greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people of the entire world and greatly dampens the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries.

The revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and broad poor and lower-middle peasants of the suburbs of Beijing have been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought for revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party for several months. The great revolutionary criticism has raised the consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and promoted the development of production. This year, Beijing's wheat has achieved a bumper harvest. Now, our country's hydrogen bomb has also successfully detonated! This is indeed joy upon joy! We poor and lower-middle peasants must implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and strive for greater victories in both revolution and production. We must use the actual actions of producing more grain to celebrate the successful detonation of our country's first hydrogen bomb, to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to consolidate our great socialist motherland.

We are determined to turn the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the rural areas of Beijing. Let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the entire China, shine over the entire world.

    毛主席的英明预言实现了
    北京市革命委员会委员
    北京市贫下中农代表会常委  康淑芬
    我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了，我们的伟大领袖毛主席的预言已经实现了。这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一辉煌成果。这是我们全国贫下中农、全国人民以及全世界革命人民的特大喜事。让我们千遍万遍地高呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！让我们最衷心地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，是对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义核垄断的又一沉重的打击，是对全世界革命人民非常有力的支持。这一伟大胜利，大大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。
    北京市郊区的无产阶级革命派、革命干部和广大贫下中农，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判已经好几个月了。革命的大批判，提高了广大贫下中农的觉悟，促进了生产的发展。今年北京的小麦获得了大丰收。现在我国氢弹又爆炸成功了！这真是喜上加喜！我们贫下中农一定要贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，争取革命和生产的更大胜利。我们一定要用多打粮食的实际行动来庆祝我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，来支援无产阶级文化大革命，来巩固我们伟大的社会主义祖国。
    我们决心把北京郊区农村办成毛泽东思想的大学校，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在北京农村永远高高飘扬。让光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光芒照耀全中国，照耀全世界。
