A Revolting Anti-Revolutionary Farce

Recently, the so-called Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers held in Moscow was a revolting anti-revolutionary farce staged and manufactured by the Soviet revisionist leadership. At this congress, the literary and academic lackeys of the Soviet revisionist clique danced wildly, peddling black-market revisionist goods. This is another piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionist leadership using literature to maintain their anti-revolutionary revisionist rule and fully restore capitalism.

The central slogan openly proposed at this congress, "Long live the alliance of life and creation, art and revolution!" is a thoroughly anti-revolutionary slogan. Everyone knows that this slogan is not a new invention of the Soviet revisionist clique. As early as the period before and after the October Revolution, the reactionary idealist philosophers like Bogdanov, who were condemned by Lenin, had advocated "Soviet power and proletarian art coexist" to achieve the goal of opposing the proletarian revolution. Later, in the 1920s, Trotsky proposed the reactionary view of "politics—Marxist; art—bourgeois" dualism or pluralism to oppose art serving proletarian politics. The purpose was also to oppose Marxism-Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The "Long live the alliance of life and creation, art and revolution!" advocated by the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers is actually a rehashed version of the reactionary slogans of Bogdanov and Trotsky.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." The Soviet revisionist clique denies that art belongs to a certain class and a certain political line, and completely equates art and revolution, calling for them to shout "Long live!" together. This itself is evidence that the embers of capitalism have completely reignited in the Soviet Union, and it also shows that they are of the same ilk as the reactionary bourgeois politicians like Bogdanov and Trotsky, traitors to Marxism-Leninism, and sworn enemies of the proletarian revolution!

One of the main features of the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers is the frenzied anti-China sentiment.

The Soviet revisionists, in collusion with imperialism and reactionary forces in various countries, frenziedly attack the Communist Party of China, slander our great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and defame our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, just as a mad dog barks at the sun, they cannot harm a single hair of the Chinese people, nor can they tarnish the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought. Their frenzied attacks and vile abuse only further expose their reactionary and politically weak faces.

Another main feature of this congress is the shameless glorification of American imperialism, openly acting as the most despicable accomplice of the number one enemy of the people of the world. The congress passed a so-called "resolution in support of the Vietnamese brothers," and after hypocritically expressing "support for the sacred struggle of the Vietnamese people," it humbly "requested" the U.S. government to "stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam," completely betraying the interests of the heroic Vietnamese people and serving the "bomb to force peace" and "bomb to lure peace" conspiracies of Johnson and his ilk.

Many reports and speeches at this congress boast that since the Third Congress, great achievements have been made in all aspects. What are the so-called achievements of Soviet literature in the past seven years? They have further degenerated into tools for the Soviet revisionist clique to spiritually enslave the Soviet people, completely becoming reactionary propaganda for the class will, class demands, and class interests of the Soviet bourgeois privileged class. The so-called "masterpieces" published in large quantities by the Soviet revisionists in the past seven years are mainly content that more viciously attacks the dictatorship of the proletariat, more fervently advocates bourgeois individualism, humanitarianism, and humanism, more frenziedly curses revolution and revolutionary war, more despicably defames the great image of Lenin, slanders the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, and more extensively promotes bourgeois liberalization.

In summary, this is a gathering of traitors, scabs, literary lackeys of the Soviet bourgeois privileged class, and imperialist running dogs, a public congress openly opposing Marxism-Leninism, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the people, and revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the historical wheel, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly achieve victory." Today, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has already sounded the death knell for you. The day when the Soviet people will settle accounts with the Soviet revisionist leadership and their literary lackeys for their heinous crimes will not be long in coming.

    一出群魔乱舞的反革命丑剧
    樊秀文
    最近在莫斯科举行的所谓苏联作家第四次代表大会，是苏修领导集团策划和制造的一出反革命丑剧。在这个会上，苏修集团御用的文人学者群魔乱舞，大肆贩卖修正主义的黑货。这是苏修领导集团利用文艺来维持他们的反革命修正主义统治、全面复辟资本主义的又一个罪证。
    这次大会公开提出的中心口号“生活和创作、艺术和革命的联盟万岁！”就是一个彻头彻尾的反革命口号。大家知道，这个口号并不是苏修集团的新发明。早在十月革命前后遭到过列宁痛斥的波格丹诺夫之流的反动唯心主义哲学家，就曾经鼓吹“苏维埃政权和无产阶级艺术并行”，以达到反对无产阶级革命的目的。后来到了二十年代，托洛茨基又提出所谓“政治——马克思主义的；艺术——资产阶级的”二元论或多元论的反动观点，来反对艺术为无产阶级政治服务，其目的也是为了反对马克思列宁主义和无产阶级专政。苏修第四次作家代表大会所鼓吹的“生活和创作、艺术和革命的联盟万岁”，实际上就是波格丹诺夫、托洛茨基之流的反动口号的改头换面的翻版。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在的世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”苏修集团否定艺术属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线，完全平列的提出艺术和革命，为它们同呼“万岁”，这本身就是资本主义的死灰已经在苏联公开地完全复燃的例证，同时也表明他们同波格丹诺夫、托洛茨基之流的反动资产阶级政客完全是一丘之貉，是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，是无产阶级革命的死敌！
    苏修第四次作家代表大会的一个主要特点，就是疯狂地反华。
    苏修伙同帝国主义和各国反动派，疯狂攻击中国共产党，诽谤我们的伟大领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想，诬蔑我国无产阶级文化大革命。然而，正象狂犬吠日一样，他们根本动不了中国人民的半根毫毛，丝毫也损害不了伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。他们的疯狂攻击和无耻谩骂，只能更进一步暴露他们反革命狰狞面目和政治上的虚弱。
    这次大会的另一个主要特点，是百般美化美帝国主义，公然充当这个全世界人民头号敌人的最卑鄙的帮凶。大会通过一项所谓“声援越南兄弟”的决议，在假惺惺地表示“支持越南人民的神圣斗争”之后，就低声下气地“要求”美国政府“停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸”，完全背叛英雄的越南人民的利益，为约翰逊之流“以炸迫和”、“以炸诱和”的阴谋效劳。
    这次大会的许多报告和发言，都自吹自擂，宣称自第三次代表大会以来各方面都“取得了巨大的成就”。近七年来，苏修文学的“成就”究竟是些什么货色呢？那就是更进一步堕落成为苏修集团对苏联人民实行精神奴役的工具，完完全全地沦为苏联资产阶级特权阶层的阶级意志、阶级要求和阶级利益的反动宣传品罢了。苏修近七年来大量出版的种种所谓的“文坛杰作”，其主要内容无非更加恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政，更加狂热地宣扬资产阶级个人主义、人道主义和人性论，更加疯狂地诅咒革命和革命战争，更加卑鄙地丑化伟大列宁的形象，诽谤伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林，更大规模地鼓吹资产阶级自由化。
    总之，这是一个叛徒、工贼、苏联资产阶级特权阶层的御用文人和帝国主义走狗的集会，是一次公开反对马克思列宁主义、反对无产阶级专政、反对人民、反对革命的大会。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”今天，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，已经敲响了你们的丧钟。苏联人民起来清算苏修领导集团以及他们的文坛走卒们的滔天罪行的日子，不会太长久了。
