Arab friends in Beijing held a rally this afternoon to strongly condemn the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism, which instigated its tool, Israel, to launch armed attacks on Arab countries. They also strongly denounced the shameful behavior of the Soviet revisionist leadership in pretending to support while actually betraying the Arab people.

Friends from some Asian and African countries, as well as from England, the U.S., and other countries, and representatives from various revolutionary groups in the capital also attended the meeting. They unanimously expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the people of various Arab countries against U.S. and British imperialism and Israel.

The meeting was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere. Slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!", "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!", "Down with the tool of U.S. imperialism, Israel!", "The Arab people will surely win!", "U.S. imperialism and its tool Israel will surely fail!", "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!", and "Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout the venue.

The meeting began with Sudanese friend Osman leading everyone to recall Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true strength does not lie with the reactionaries but with the people."

The chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing, Jabir, spoke first at the meeting. He said that the aggression launched by the Zionist elements of Israel against Arab countries is essentially a joint aggression by the U.S., Britain, and Israel.

Jabir denounced the Soviet revisionists' capitulationist stance on the Middle East issue. He said that the Arab people are determined to fight to the end, and the Palestinian people will never lay down their weapons. They will reorganize their forces and, together with the Arab people's forces, continue the struggle to the end. Palestine will surely be liberated, and imperialism will surely be destroyed. Jabir said: The Arab people will seriously study the works of Chairman Mao because Chairman Mao's works are the beacon lighting the path of the Arab people's struggle.

The secretary-general of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau, Senanayake, pointed out at the meeting: In the aggression by U.S. and British imperialism and their running dog Israel against Arab countries, Soviet modern revisionism played the role of a traitor. He said, this completely and thoroughly exposed the hypocrisy, evil plots, and capitulationist policies of Soviet modern revisionism.

An Arab friend working in Beijing, Jalad, pointed out at the meeting that imperialism led by the U.S. and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Union are the number one enemies of the Arab people and all people of the world. Jalad said, the role played by Soviet revisionism is one that the warships, airplanes, and atomic bombs of historical imperialism could not play. The Arab people's opposition to U.S. imperialism must also be directed against Soviet modern revisionism.

Jalad pointed out that for the Arab people to achieve victory against aggression and complete liberation, they must follow the path taken by China. He expressed that Arab friends in Beijing are determined to study the works of Chairman Mao, to be good students of Chairman Mao, and to struggle for the national liberation of the Arab people.

The secretary of the Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Yang Jue, said at the meeting that the 700 million Chinese people, who are currently victorious in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to be a strong rear guard for the Arab people.

American friend Adler strongly condemned in his speech the U.S. imperialism's instigation of Israel to massacre the Arab people and the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the revolutionary interests of the Arab people.

An Azanian liberation fighter expressed at the meeting resolute support for the just struggle of the people of various Arab countries against U.S. and British imperialism and Israel. He pointed out that as long as the Arab people unite and persist in the struggle, victory will surely belong to the Arab people.

The meeting concluded with thunderous applause as the appeal to the people of the world and the letter of thanks to the Chinese people from the Arabs working in Beijing were passed. The letter of thanks stated that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the 700 million Chinese people are the most loyal comrades and strongest rear guard of the Arab people. The letter of thanks expressed that the Arab people are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to carry the national liberation struggle of the Arab people to the end.

    在京的阿拉伯朋友集会声讨美英以侵略罪行
    美帝苏修是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人
    据新华社十五日讯  在北京的阿拉伯朋友今天下午集会，愤怒声讨美英帝国主义唆使其工具以色列武装侵略阿拉伯国家的罪行，强烈谴责苏修领导集团对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的可耻行为。
    在北京的一些亚非国家和英、美等国家朋友以及首都各界革命群众的代表也出席了大会。他们一致表示坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民以及阿拉伯各国人民反对美、英帝国主义和以色列的正义斗争。
    会场充满着强烈的革命气氛。“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒美帝国主义的工具以色列！”“阿拉伯人民必胜！”“美帝国主义及其工具以色列必败！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声响彻会场。
    大会开始，苏丹朋友奥斯曼领着大家重温毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻京办事处主任加尔布在大会上首先讲话。他说，以色列犹太复国主义分子对阿拉伯国家所发动的侵略，实质上是美英以的联合侵略。
    加尔布谴责苏修在中东问题上的投降主义立场。他说，阿拉伯人民决心斗争到底，巴勒斯坦人民决不会放下武器。他们将重新组织自己的队伍，同阿拉伯人民的队伍一起，把斗争进行到底。巴勒斯坦必将获得解放，帝国主义一定被消灭。加尔布说：阿拉伯人民将认真地学习毛主席著作，因为毛主席的著作是照亮阿拉伯人民斗争道路的灯塔。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在大会上指出：在美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略中，苏联现代修正主义扮演了叛徒角色。他说，这就完全、彻底地暴露了苏联现代修正主义的伪善、罪恶的阴谋和投降主义的政策。
    在北京工作的阿拉伯朋友代表加拉德在大会上指出，以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏修为中心的现代修正主义是阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的头号敌人。加拉德说，苏联修正主义所起的作用，是历史上帝国主义的军舰、飞机和原子弹所不能起的作用。阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义，必须反对苏联现代修正主义。
    加拉德指出，阿拉伯人民要争取反侵略的胜利和彻底的解放，必须走中国所走的道路。他表示阿拉伯在北京的朋友，决心学习毛主席著作，做毛主席的好学生，为阿拉伯人民的民族解放而斗争。
    中国亚非团结委员会书记处书记杨骥在大会上说，正在胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓作阿拉伯人民的坚强后盾。
    美国朋友艾德勒在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义唆使以色列屠杀阿拉伯人民，强烈谴责苏修领导集团出卖阿拉伯人民的革命利益。
    阿扎尼亚解放战士在大会上表示坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美英帝国主义和以色列的正义斗争。他指出，只要阿拉伯人民团结一致，坚持斗争，胜利一定属于阿拉伯人民。
    大会最后在雷鸣般的掌声中通过了在北京工作的阿拉伯人给全世界人民的呼吁书和给中国人民的感谢信。感谢信中说，在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的七亿中国人民，是阿拉伯人民最忠诚的战友和最坚强的后盾。感谢信中表示阿拉伯人民决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把阿拉伯人民的民族解放斗争进行到底。
