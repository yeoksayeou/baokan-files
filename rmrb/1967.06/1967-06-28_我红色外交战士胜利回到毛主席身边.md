Highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they braved through the Indian reactionaries' numerous obstacles. Our red diplomats triumphantly returned to the side of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao.

Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian, on behalf of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, went to the airport to warmly welcome the red diplomats who had returned from India.

Thousands of revolutionary masses from the proletariat of the capital, along with soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and Red Guards, gathered at the airport to welcome the red diplomats. They vehemently denounced the heinous crimes of the Indian reactionaries.

On June 27, the New China News Agency reported that our red diplomats, who were severely beaten by mobs instigated by the Indian reactionary government, fought unyieldingly against the Indian reactionaries. They braved through numerous obstacles and returned to Beijing on a special plane this morning, triumphantly returning to the side of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao.

Central leaders Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian, on behalf of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, went to the capital airport to warmly welcome the red diplomats who had returned from India. They praised their brave and tenacious struggle against the Indian reactionaries.

Today, the capital airport was adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums. Thousands of revolutionary masses from the proletariat of the capital, soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards gathered at the airport to welcome the red diplomats. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with his quotations, expressing their deep concern for our injured diplomats. The welcoming crowd excitedly said that our diplomats, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless red diplomats. They bravely foiled the Indian reactionaries' various plots, defended the Five-Star Red Flag with their blood, and upheld the dignity of our socialist motherland. Their victory is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

At the airport, the welcoming crowd repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and read quotations about how imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They strongly condemned and vehemently denounced the Indian reactionaries' heinous crimes of bloodily persecuting our diplomats. They solemnly pointed out that the Indian government, willing to serve the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, has been crazily provoking China. In the end, they will meet a bad fate and will one day be thrown into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people of India.

At 10 a.m., the special plane carrying the red diplomats landed at the airport. Amidst a chorus of slogans, the first secretary of our embassy in India, Chen Luzhi, the third secretary, Xie Chenghao, and other diplomats, Zhang Deliang, Li Zhaoqian, Shen Ganbei, Hong Chuanjia, and Liu Zhongfu, stepped out of the plane. They held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and, with tears of joy, shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The most severely injured comrades, Wang Liren and Li Siheng, were carried off the plane on stretchers. Despite their severe injuries, they held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and, with tears in their eyes, shouted, "The Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with its enemies!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, and Li Xiannian walked to the plane and shook hands with Chen Luzhi and the others, warmly greeting them. The central leaders also stayed by the stretchers of Wang Liren and Li Siheng for a long time. Chen Luzhi and the others, with tears of joy, repeatedly said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, the Party Central Committee!"

Diplomats from the Albanian and Vietnamese embassies in China, as well as representatives from the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's permanent mission in China, also went to the airport to welcome the red diplomats. They expressed their greetings and highly praised their brave fighting spirit. The acting head of the Albanian embassy in China, Baba Ni, said to our red diplomats, "In the face of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, imperialism and all reactionaries will be smashed to pieces."

The red diplomats, Yao Denshan, Xu Ren, Shi Xinren, and Zhao Xiaoshou, who had bravely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries, met with Chen Luzhi and the others at the airport. They warmly shook hands, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight to the end against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses went forward and presented "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the returning diplomats. They pinned Mao badges and quotation placards on the red diplomats' chests. At this moment, the thousands of welcoming crowds at the airport continuously shouted, "Salute to the comrades who returned after being persecuted by the Indian government!" "Salute to the brave diplomats of our embassy in India!" "Learn from the brave fighting red diplomats!"

Then, the red diplomats, accompanied by central leaders and representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses, circled the airport to meet with revolutionary comrades from all walks of life. At this time, the crowd continuously shouted, "Strongly protest the Indian government's persecution of our diplomats!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" "Down with U.S. and British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Those who went to the airport to welcome the diplomats included leaders from relevant departments, Luo Guibo, Han Nianlong, Hao Deqing, Xie Huai'de, Chu Tunan, Wang Weizhen, and others.

This morning, when the red diplomats boarded the special plane in Kunming, leaders of the People's Liberation Army in Kunming, revolutionary masses from the proletariat of Kunming, Red Guards, and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, numbering in the hundreds, went to the airport to warmly see them off.

    在机场上，欢迎的群众一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的教导，朗读关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的语录，强烈谴责和愤怒声讨印度反动派血腥迫害我外交人员的滔天罪行。他们严正地指出，印度政府甘心为美帝、苏修效劳，不断疯狂地进行反华挑衅，到头来决没有好下场，总有一天要被印度革命人民抛进历史的垃圾箱。
    上午十时，红色外交战士们乘坐的专机在机场降落。在一片口号声中，我驻印度大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直、三等秘书谢承浩，以及其他外交人员章德良、李兆乾、沈干北、洪传家、刘忠富，走出机舱。他们高举伟大领袖毛主席像，向着祖国亲人和革命战友，激动地连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”受伤最重的王里仁同志和李思衡同志躺在担架上，被医护人员抬下飞机。他们伤重辗转困难，仍然拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，噙着热泪，一字一字地呼道：“中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”！“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    李富春、陈毅和李先念等负责同志，走到飞机前，同陈鲁直等同志一一握手，亲切地向他们问候。中央负责同志还在王里仁同志和李思衡同志的担架旁，长时间地看望他们。陈鲁直等同志脸上挂着泪花，激动地连说道：“感谢毛主席！感谢党中央！”“感谢毛主席！感谢党中央！”
    阿尔巴尼亚、越南驻中国大使馆外交官员和越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表，也到机场迎接，向我红色外交战士表示问候，并热烈赞扬他们的英勇斗争精神。阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办巴巴尼向我红色外交战士们说：“在用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民面前，帝国主义和一切反动派都将被碰得头破血流。”
    同印尼反动派进行过英勇斗争的姚登山、徐仁、时心仁和赵小寿等红色外交战士，同陈鲁直等红色外交战士，有着共同斗争的经历，他们在机场相会的时候，亲切地紧紧地握手，表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派斗争到底。
    无产阶级革命派代表走上前去，向光荣归来的外交战士赠送《毛主席语录》，把毛主席像章和毛主席语录牌戴在红色外交战士的胸前。这时，机场上的数千欢迎群众不断高呼：“向受印度政府迫害回国的同志致敬！”“向英勇斗争的我驻印度大使馆全体同志致敬！”“向英勇斗争的红色外交战士学习！”
    接着红色外交战士们由中央负责同志和无产阶级革命派代表陪同，绕场一周，同各界革命同志见面。这时，人们连续高呼：“强烈抗议印度政府迫害我外交人员的暴行！”“打倒印度反动派！”“打倒美、英帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“中国共产党万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”口号声响彻首都机场上空。
    到机场欢迎的，还有各有关方面负责人罗贵波、韩念龙、郝德青、谢怀德、楚图南、王唯真等同志。
    今天清晨红色外交战士乘专机离开昆明时，中国人民解放军驻昆明部队负责人，昆明无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和解放军战士共数百人，到机场热烈欢送。
