	New World Born in Great Criticism

	Over a hundred years ago, Marx called on the proletariat and laboring people of the world to "discover a new world in the criticism of the old world."

	The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is revolutionary and critical, born and developed in the midst of revolutionary great criticism. Every step forward requires struggle.

	The revolutionary great criticism movement currently underway among the hundreds of millions of people in our country is a movement to popularize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a movement to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in the realm of ideology.

	The old world of the exploiting classes is perishing in the revolutionary great criticism, and the new world of communism is being born in the revolutionary great criticism!

	The Line Between the People and the Enemy

	The line between the people and the enemy is concentrated in one point: their attitude toward Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary people love our socialist country in every way, and what they love most is the great Mao Zedong Thought. Class enemies hate everything about our socialist country, but they always direct their hatred toward the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	One loves, the other hates; two completely different class standpoints, two completely different emotions, dividing two completely different kinds of people: revolutionary people and class enemies.

    群言集
    新世界在大批判中诞生
    早在一百多年前，马克思就向全世界无产阶级和劳动人民发出了“在批判旧世界中发现新世界”的战斗号召。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质是革命的、批判的，是在革命的大批判中产生的和发展的。它每前进一步，都要经过战斗。
    我国目前在亿万群众中开展的革命的大批判运动，就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想大普及的运动，就是在意识形态领域内的灭资兴无运动。
    剥削阶级的旧世界正在革命的大批判中灭亡，共产主义的新世界正在革命的大批判中诞生！				王永福
    人民和敌人的分界线
    人民和敌人的分界线，集中到一点，就是对毛泽东思想的态度。革命的人民对我们这个社会主义国家千爱万爱，最爱的是伟大的毛泽东思想。阶级敌人对我们这个社会主义国家这也恨，那也恨，但他们总是把仇恨集中指向伟大的毛泽东思想。
    一个是爱，一个是恨，两种截然不同的阶级立场，两种截然不同的感情，划分出两种截然不同的人：革命人民和阶级敌人。		　鲁未升
