    Hong Kong Compatriots Defy "Emergency Regulations" and Intensify Anti-Violence Actions
    Hong Kong Compatriots Post Big-Character Posters to Expose British Imperialist Crimes

    According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 21st, the brave and tenacious Hong Kong compatriots, in their struggle against British imperialism and violence, have defied the so-called "emergency regulations" imposed by the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong. They have widely used big-character posters, slogans, and leaflets to engage in a head-on struggle against the evil British imperialists.

    Over the past month, workers, farmers, fishermen, young students, artists, peddlers, shop assistants, and the broad masses of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "big-character posters are a very useful new weapon," have extensively used anti-violence big-character posters, slogans, and leaflets. They have fully exposed the heinous crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities and boosted the morale of the broad masses of patriotic compatriots. They have posted anti-violence big-character posters in the central districts, suburbs, rural areas, and fishing villages, as well as on public squares, roads, sea walls, and hilltops. Some have even posted them on the buildings of the British authorities' police stations, "magistrates' courts," fire departments, post offices, government-run schools, hospitals, airports, and train stations. These posters have exposed the British authorities' bloody suppression of our Chinese compatriots and the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong over more than a hundred years. They have propagated the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and praised our great leader Chairman Mao.

    The workers of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory were the first to use big-character posters and slogans to fight against the British authorities in Hong Kong. On May 9th, they strongly protested the British authorities' creation of the "San Po Kong Bloodshed" by posting a big-character poster outside the factory that read, "Indict the British authorities for interfering in labor-management disputes." Subsequently, the workers of the Qingzhou Cement Factory also posted big-character posters in support of the artificial flower factory workers' struggle against oppression. On May 22nd, the employees of the Kowloon Public Bus Company held a rally at the Tsim Sha Tsui bus station, and within two days, they posted anti-violence slogans on nearly a thousand buses in Kowloon. Some British-owned enterprises, such as the Hong Kong Electric Company, the China Light and Power Company, the Dairy Company, the Gas Company, and the Star Ferry Company, also had their factory premises and ferries covered with anti-violence big-character posters and slogans by the workers.

    The farmers and fishermen in the New Territories and the suburbs of Hong Kong also widely posted anti-violence big-character posters and slogans in rural areas, towns, and fishing villages. In Shatoujiao Town, near our Ba'an County, Hong Kong compatriots bravely surrounded the local British police station and covered the walls around it with anti-violence big-character posters. In Sheung Shui, fearless farmer comrades cleverly and bravely posted anti-violence big-character posters on the British military barracks.

    The most severe blow to the enemy was the big-character posters posted outside the gates of the British authorities' highest ruling body, the "Government House." Because the British "Governor" David Trench repeatedly refused to accept the representatives of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Struggle Committee against British Oppression, the patriotic compatriots were filled with indignation. Starting from May 18th, for four consecutive days, batches of anti-violence big-character posters and slogans were posted outside the gates and walls of the "Government House," even covering the sentry boxes.

    The British authorities in Hong Kong were terrified and enraged by the anti-violence big-character posters, slogans, leaflets, cartoons, and pictures that exposed their heinous crimes. On May 31st, the British authorities hastily issued a so-called "emergency regulation" banning the posting of inflammatory slogans.

    The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong paid no heed to the "emergency regulations" and resolutely engaged in a head-on struggle with the British authorities in Hong Kong. The more the British authorities banned, the more they posted. For every poster the British tore down, the patriotic compatriots posted ten more. They said, "You have your emergency regulations, and I have my anti-violence actions." The workers of the Star Ferry Company, the Hong Kong Electric Company, and the China Light and Power Company, on the day after the British authorities forcibly tore down the big-character posters, reposted the anti-violence big-character posters on the ferries and inside and outside the factory premises, and even more than before.

    The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong defied the so-called "emergency regulations" of the British authorities in Hong Kong, making the British authorities extremely embarrassed. The anti-violence big-character posters greatly boosted the morale of the Hong Kong compatriots and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of British imperialism. The broad masses of patriotic compatriots expressed that in the future, they would more extensively use this "new weapon" to bring down and disgrace the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong!

    蔑视“紧急法令”　加强抗暴行动
    香港同胞大贴大字报揭露英帝罪行
    据新华社香港二十一日电　英勇顽强的香港爱国同胞在反英抗暴斗争中，蔑视港英法西斯当局的所谓“紧急法令”，广泛使用大字报、标语和传单，向万恶的英帝国主义展开针锋相对的斗争。
    一个多月来，香港的工人、农民、渔民、青年学生、艺术工作者、小贩、店员和广大的爱国同胞，遵照毛主席的“大字报是一种极其有用的新式武器”的教导，广泛地使用抗暴大字报、抗暴标语和抗暴传单，充分揭露港英当局的滔天罪行，鼓舞广大爱国同胞的斗志。他们把抗暴大字报贴在市中心区、郊区、农村和渔区的公共场所、马路、海堤和山头上，有的还贴在港英当局的警署、“裁判署”、消防局、邮政局、官立学校、医院、飞机场、火车站等的建筑物上。这些大字报，揭露了港英当局血腥镇压我中国同胞和英帝国主义一百多年在香港犯下的滔天罪行，宣传了光焰无际的毛泽东思想，歌颂了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。
    香港人造塑胶花厂工人首先使用大字报和标语同港英当局进行斗争。五月九日，他们为强烈抗议港英当局制造“新蒲岗血案”，在这家工厂的厂房外贴出了“控诉港英当局插手干预劳资纠纷”的大字报。接着，青洲英坭厂工人也贴出支援塑胶花工厂工人反迫害斗争的大字报。五月二十二日，九龙公共汽车公司职工在尖沙咀车站举行誓师大会，他们两天内就在九龙近千辆公共汽车上全部贴上了抗暴标语。一些英资企业如香港电灯公司、中华电力公司、牛奶公司、煤气公司的厂房内外和天星小轮公司的渡海小轮上，也都被工人贴满了抗暴大字报和抗暴标语。
    新界各区和香港郊区的农民和渔民，也广泛地在农村、城镇、渔区张贴抗暴大字报和抗暴标语。在邻近我宝安县的沙头角镇，香港同胞英勇地包围了当地的英国警署，在警署四周的墙上贴满了抗暴大字报。在上水，无所畏惧的农民兄弟，勇敢而又机智地把抗暴大字报贴到英军兵营去。
    对敌人打击最沉重的，是贴在港英最高统治机关“总督府”门外的大字报。由于港英“总督”戴麟趾一再拒绝接受港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会代表的抗议，爱国同胞无不义愤填膺，从五月十八日起，一连四天，大批大批的抗暴大字报和抗暴标语，贴到“总督府”的大门外、围墙上，连卫兵的岗亭都贴满了。
    港英当局对揭露它的滔天罪行的抗暴大字报、标语、传单、漫画、图片，怕得要死，恨得要命。五月三十一日，港英当局急急忙忙抛出一个所谓“禁贴煽动性标语”的“紧急法令”。
    香港爱国同胞根本就不顾什么“紧急法令”，坚决同港英当局展开了针锋相对的斗争。港英当局越是禁止，他们越是要贴，港英撕一张，爱国同胞就贴十张。他们说：“你有你的紧急法令，我有我的抗暴行动。”天星小轮公司、香港电灯公司、中华电力公司的工人，在港英当局强行撕毁大字报的第二天，就把抗暴大字报重新贴在渡轮上和厂房内外，而且比以前贴得更多。
    香港爱国同胞就是蔑视港英当局的所谓“紧急法令”，使港英当局狼狈万分。抗暴大字报大长了香港同胞的志气，大灭了英帝国主义的威风。广大爱国同胞表示，今后还要更广泛地使用这种“新式武器”，把港英法西斯当局搞垮、搞臭！
