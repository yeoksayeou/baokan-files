In Tianjin, the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition Team held a rally and march.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 1: Over 200 Japanese friends from the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition Team in Tianjin held a rally and march today, strongly protesting the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government in sabotaging the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition and Sino-Japanese trade.

The Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition was originally scheduled to open today in Tianjin. However, due to the unreasonable obstruction by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese Sato reactionary government, part of the exhibition items could not be transported to China, and the opening could not be held as scheduled.

Representatives from Japanese friendly trading companies stationed in Beijing and the friendly delegation from the East China branch of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, totaling over 100 Japanese friends, also formed a support team and rushed from Beijing to Tianjin to participate in today's rally and march.

At the beginning of the meeting, the Japanese friends wore Mao Zedong badges on their chests and collectively read Mao Zedong's quote: "All the peoples of the world, unite! Overthrow the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world should unite and defeat the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs! The people of the whole world should have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, dare to win, and dare to sacrifice. That is the only way to win victory. All the ghosts and monsters will be buried by the people." The secretary-general of the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition Team, Morita Takamaru, reported on the struggle to bring all the exhibition items to China. Deputy Secretary-General Kobayashi Takaharu spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade is in the interests of the peoples of both countries and is the common wish of the peoples of both countries. U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists can absolutely not obstruct it or destroy it.

The meeting unanimously passed a declaration. The declaration condemned the Sato government for unreasonably obstructing the timely opening of the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition and called on the units participating in the exhibition, related industries, and the broad masses of people in Japan to unite and strive for the successful holding of the exhibition.

Representatives from the Tianjin branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and representatives from all Chinese staff of the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition also spoke at the meeting, firmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese friends.

The meeting read a message of support from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. The message said, as long as the friendly trade and industrial circles in Japan, together with the broad masses of the Japanese people, dare to struggle and fear no difficulties, the final victory will belong to the Japanese people. Seven hundred million Chinese people will forever support the just struggles of the Japanese people. After the meeting, the Japanese friends held a march, carrying portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao. They held self-made placards and shouted slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with the Japanese Sato reactionary government! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Down with the Japanese Communist Party revisionists!" "Resolutely oppose the embargo policy hostile to China!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" The Japanese friends' march was warmly welcomed and supported by the revolutionary masses of Tianjin.

    强烈抗议美日反动派和日修破坏展览会和中日贸易的罪行
    日本科学仪器展览团在天津集会游行
    据新华社天津一日电　在天津的日本科学仪器展览团的二百多名日本朋友，今天举行了集会和游行，强烈抗议美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府破坏日本科学仪器展览会和中日贸易的罪行。
    日本科学仪器展览会原定今天在天津开幕，但是由于美帝国主义和日本佐藤反动政府无理阻挠其中一部分展览品运来中国，没有能够如期举行。
    常驻北京的日本友好商社的代表和正在北京访问的日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局友好代表团共一百多名日本朋友，也组成了支援团，专程从北京赶到天津，参加了今天的集会和游行。
    大会开始时，日本朋友胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，集体朗读了毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”日本科学仪器展览团事务局局长森田尧丸在会上介绍了为争取全部展览品运来中国的斗争经过。展览团副团长小林隆治在会上讲话指出，日中友好和贸易的发展，完全符合日中两国人民的利益，是两国人民的共同愿望。美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义、日共修正主义分子都绝对阻挠不了它，破坏不了它。
    大会一致通过了一项宣言。宣言谴责佐藤政府无理阻挠日本科学仪器展览会的如期开幕，并号召在日本国内的参加展出的单位、有关行业和广大人民，团结一致，为展览会的胜利举行而奋斗。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会天津分会的代表和日本科学仪器展览会全体中国方面的工作人员的代表也分别在大会上发言，坚决支持日本朋友的正义斗争。
    会上宣读了中国国际贸易促进委员会给大会的支持电。支持电说，只要日本友好贸易界和产业界的朋友们，同日本广大人民一道，不畏强暴，勇于斗争，最后胜利一定是属于日本人民的。七亿中国人民永远支持日本人民的一切正义斗争。大会结束以后，日本朋友们高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，举行了游行。他们手持自己制作的标语牌，高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义！打倒日本佐藤反动政府！打倒苏联现代修正主义！打倒日共修正主义分子！”“坚决反对敌视中国的禁运政策！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”日本朋友的游行，受到天津革命群众的热烈欢迎和支持。
