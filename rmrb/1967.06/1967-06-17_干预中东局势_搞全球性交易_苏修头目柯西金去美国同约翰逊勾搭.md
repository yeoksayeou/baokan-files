	Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin today left Moscow with a large delegation to the United States to hold talks with the head of American imperialism, Johnson, directly engaging in global collusion.

	Kosygin's trip is ostensibly to attend the United Nations to participate in the special emergency session of the General Assembly, hastily convened at the request of the Soviet revisionists to discuss the Middle East situation. In reality, it is a measure to cover up the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership after their betrayal of the Arab people has been exposed. According to reports from Western news agencies, more importantly, the Soviet revisionists want to hold direct high-level talks with American imperialism.

	The Americans are not hiding this at all. After the news of Kosygin's planned trip to the U.S. was released on the 15th, the White House spokesman Christian immediately stated the official attitude of the U.S. at that day's press conference: "If the United Nations General Assembly is convened, if he wishes to meet the President, the President will certainly be happy to meet him." He also said: Johnson's previous expression of his welcome to Kosygin to go to the United States remains valid.

	The United Press International correspondent Hansley reported from Washington on the 15th that one of the factors in Kosygin's trip to the United States is the hope of holding such a face-to-face discussion (with Johnson). This correspondent, when discussing the farce of Kosygin possibly denouncing the U.S.-Israeli aggression against Arab countries at the special emergency session of the General Assembly while conducting backroom deals with Johnson, wrote: "Despite the need for public denunciation, this does not prevent the Soviet leaders from calmly and seriously discussing some 'serious issues' privately with the head of American imperialism." He believes that such backroom deals "are much more important than anything that happens at the United Nations."

	This high-level U.S.-Soviet talk will be the first direct talk between the new Soviet revisionist leadership and the head of American imperialism since Khrushchev held talks with Eisenhower at Camp David in 1959 and with Kennedy in Vienna in 1961. In the 1959 Camp David talks, Khrushchev made a major betrayal of the world's revolutionary cause under the cover of the so-called "Camp David spirit"; in the 1961 Vienna talks, Khrushchev made another major betrayal on a series of major issues. Currently, the Kosygin clique is engaged in a global betrayal that surpasses Khrushchev. According to reports in American newspapers, the U.S.-Soviet leaders in the upcoming backroom talks will not only continue to closely collude in the aggression against Arab countries but will also conduct a "package deal." The New York Times said on the 16th, "A meeting between Johnson and Kosygin will provide an opportunity to study the Vietnam issue," "Progress made through Soviet-American cooperation in resolving one conflict will clearly contribute to creating a better atmosphere for resolving another conflict." American newspapers believe that in addition to the Vietnam issue, this talk may also involve backroom deals on the "non-proliferation treaty" and "freezing anti-ballistic missile systems."

	Kosygin arrived in Paris today on his way to the United States. There, he first held talks with French President de Gaulle.

### 干预中东局势　搞全球性交易  苏修头目柯西金去美国同约翰逊勾搭

    干预中东局势　搞全球性交易
    苏修头目柯西金去美国同约翰逊勾搭
    新华社十六日讯　苏联修正主义领导集团头目柯西金今天率领一个庞大的代表团离开莫斯科，前往美国，同美帝国主义头子约翰逊会谈，直接进行全球性的大勾结。
    柯西金此行，名义上是去联合国，参加由苏修自己急急忙忙要求召开的讨论中东局势的联大特别紧急会议，其实是它在出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒面目大暴露以后作出的又一掩饰措施而已。据西方通讯社报道，更加重要的是，苏修要同美帝国主义直接举行最高级会谈。
    对于这一点，美帝是毫不隐讳的。在柯西金准备去美的消息于十五日传出以后，美国白宫发言人克里斯琴立即在当天的记者招待会上表示美国的官方态度说：“如果召开联合国大会，如果他希望会见总统的话，总统当然乐于会见他。”他还说：约翰逊过去表示的他欢迎柯西金去美国的邀请依然有效。
    合众国际社记者汉斯莱在十五日发自华盛顿的一则消息说，柯西金的美国之行，“其因素之一是希望举行这样一次（同约翰逊的）面对面的讨论”。这个记者在谈到柯西金可能一面在联大特别紧急会议上就美以侵略阿拉伯国家问题捶胸顿足地“谴责”一番，同时却同约翰逊进行幕后交易的丑剧时写道：“尽管需要进行公开谩骂，但是这并不妨碍苏联领导人（同美帝头子）平静地、认真地私下讨论一些”“严重问题”。他认为，这种幕后交易“要比联合国发生的任何事情重要得多。”
    这次美苏最高级会谈，将是赫鲁晓夫一九五九年在美国的戴维营同艾森豪威尔举行会谈以及一九六一年在奥地利首都维也纳同肯尼迪举行会谈后，新的苏修领导集团头目同美帝国主义首脑举行的第一次直接会谈。在一九五九年的戴维营会谈中，赫鲁晓夫在所谓“戴维营精神”的烟幕下对世界人民的革命事业作了大出卖；在一九六一年的维也纳会谈中，赫鲁晓夫又在一系列重大问题上作了另一次大出卖。目前，柯西金之流正在进行超过赫鲁晓夫的全球性的大出卖。据美国报刊透露，美苏头子在即将举行的幕后会谈，不仅要继续在侵略阿拉伯国家方面紧密勾结，而且要进行“一揽子”交易。《纽约时报》十六日说，“约翰逊和柯西金的一次会谈将要提供一个研究越南问题的机会”，“通过苏美合作就解决一个（中东）冲突取得的进展将明显地为解决另一个冲突创造较好气氛作出贡献”。美国报刊认为，除了越南问题以外，这次会谈还可能就“防止核扩散”条约以及“冻结反导弹导弹系统”等问题进行幕后交易。
    柯西金今天在前往美国途中到达巴黎。他在那里先同法国总统戴高乐举行会谈。
