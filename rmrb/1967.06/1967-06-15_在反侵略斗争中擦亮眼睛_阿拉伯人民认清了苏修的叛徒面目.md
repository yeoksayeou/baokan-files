In the struggle against aggression, the Arab people have opened their eyes and seen through the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 14th, our correspondent reports: The Soviet revisionist leadership has long been creating the illusion in the Arab world that it is a "friend of the Arab people," portraying itself as a protector of Arab interests and deceiving people everywhere. However, in this recent war of aggression by the U.S., Britain, and Israel, because the Soviet revisionists have acted as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, their carefully crafted false image has been shattered in a few days by the awakened Arab people.

In the past few days, from Iraq in the north to Sudan in the south, from Kuwait in the east to Algeria in the west, thousands of angry crowds have demonstrated in front of Soviet embassies. Many people have also been discussing national affairs in public places, cursing the Soviet revisionists for betraying the interests of the Arab people.

The Arab people unanimously condemn the Soviet revisionists as "big traitors," "big accomplices," "the worst enemies," "friends of the enemy," "stabbing the Arab people in the back," and "owing the Arab people a blood debt." They demand that "the Soviet Union and the United States both get out," and "Kosygin should go to the garbage dump."

In this aggression by U.S. and British imperialism and their lackey Israel against Arab countries, the Soviet revisionists have served as a negative example for the Arab people, teaching them a vivid lesson. In the Arab region, the Soviet revisionists have been playing a role that U.S. imperialism cannot play. They have donned the cloak of "socialism" and used every means to serve U.S. imperialism. Through this incident, the Arab people have seen through the Soviet revisionists as their false friends and true accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

The Arab people have exposed the various deceptive tactics used by the Soviet revisionists in recent times to betray the interests of the Arab people. An Algerian said well: "Now we understand what revisionism is! The Soviet revisionists are just as bad as the Americans. They issued beautiful statements saying they support the Arabs, but when the U.S. imperialists and Israel launched the aggression, they did nothing. Not only did they not help us, but they also stabbed us in the back." The Arab people also linked the past crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership, pointing out that their betrayal of the revolutionary interests of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is consistent. A driver from the United Arab Republic said that the Soviet Union this time "did what it did during the Cuban Missile Crisis." The Arab people also pointed out that the government statements and the severance of diplomatic relations with Israel by the Soviet revisionists are all deceptive tricks.

The Soviet revisionists, in order to pose as friends of the Arab people, have maliciously slandered and defamed the sincere friends of the Arab people—the Chinese people. However, through this anti-aggression struggle, the Arab people have more clearly distinguished who their true friends are and who their false friends are. In the demonstrations condemning "the Soviet revisionists as traitors," when passing by the Chinese embassy, they always enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" An Arab journalist said well: "We begin to understand everything China has said about Soviet revisionism, and China's stance towards them is correct."

Chairman Mao taught us: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results." The Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Arab people in their anti-aggression struggle is a bad thing. However, because the true face of the Soviet revisionist traitors has been thoroughly exposed, the Arab people have a clearer understanding that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism, so that the Arab people will no longer be deceived. This is a good thing for the Arab people to successfully carry out their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and Zionism.

The exposure of the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists has made U.S. imperialism anxious. The Christian Science Monitor on the 9th lamented: "The Soviet Union has suffered a crushing blow in the entire Arab world," and "the Soviet policy seems to have been tragically crushed in the entire (Middle East) region."

### 在反侵略斗争中擦亮眼睛  阿拉伯人民认清了苏修的叛徒面目

    在反侵略斗争中擦亮眼睛
    阿拉伯人民认清了苏修的叛徒面目
    据新华社十四日讯  本社记者报道：苏修领导集团长期以来一直在阿拉伯世界制造一种所谓它是“阿拉伯人民朋友”的舆论，把自己打扮成阿拉伯人民利益的卫护者，到处招摇撞骗。但是，在这次美英以侵略战争中，由于苏修充当了美帝头号帮凶，它多年苦心经营的假形象，在几天之中，就被觉醒的阿拉伯人民打得稀巴烂。
    过去几天中，在阿拉伯世界，北起伊拉克南到苏丹，从东面的科威特到西面的阿尔及利亚，数以千计的愤怒群众到苏修大使馆前面示威，还有许多人在公共场所谈论国家大事时纷纷怒骂苏修叛卖阿拉伯人民的利益。
    阿拉伯人民异口同声地痛斥苏修是“大叛徒”，“大帮凶”，“最坏的敌人”，“敌人的朋友”，“在阿拉伯人民背上插了一刀”，“欠下了阿拉伯人民的血债”。他们要“苏联和美国一样滚出去”，“柯西金滚进垃圾堆里去”。
    在这次美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略中，苏修作为反面教员给阿拉伯人民上了生动的一课。在阿拉伯地区，苏修一直在起着美帝所不能起的作用，它披着“社会主义”的外衣，千方百计地为美帝国主义效劳。经过这次事件，阿拉伯人民看清了苏修是他们的假朋友，是美帝的真帮凶。
    阿拉伯人民一针见血地戳穿了苏修最近出卖阿拉伯人民利益所用的各种欺骗手法。一个阿尔及利亚人说得好：“我们现在明白了修正主义是什么货色！苏联修正主义者和美国佬一样是一群混蛋。他们发表了娓娓动听的声明，说什么支持阿拉伯人，但是一旦美帝国主义者和以色列发动侵略，他们却一动也不动了。他们非但不援助我们，反而在我们背上插了一刀。”阿拉伯人民还联系苏修领导集团过去的罪行，指出它叛卖亚非拉人民的革命利益是一贯的。阿联一位司机说，苏联这一次“干了在古巴危机期间所干的事”。阿拉伯人民也指出苏修的政府声明和同以色列断交都是欺骗花招。
    苏修为了冒充阿拉伯人民的朋友，大肆诬蔑诽谤阿拉伯人民的真诚朋友——中国人民。但是，阿拉伯人民通过这次反侵略斗争更清楚地分清了谁是他们真正的朋友，谁是他们的假朋友。阿拉伯人民在痛骂“苏修是叛徒”的示威中，当走过中国大使馆时，总是热情高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“人民中国万岁！”一位阿拉伯新闻工作者说得好：“我们开始懂得中国所说的关于苏联修正主义的一切，中国对他们采取的立场是正确的。”
    毛主席教导我们：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果”。苏修这次在阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争中叛卖了阿拉伯人民，这是件大坏事。但是由于苏修叛徒真面目的彻底暴露，使阿拉伯人民更清楚地认识到，反帝必须反修，使阿拉伯人民不再受骗，这对于阿拉伯人民胜利地进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争，却成为一件大好事。
    苏修叛徒面目的大暴露使美帝国主义惶惶不安。美国《基督教科学箴言报》九日社论哀叹说：苏联在“整个阿拉伯世界受到了粉碎性的打击”，“苏联的政策似乎在整个（中东）地区悲惨地粉碎了”。
