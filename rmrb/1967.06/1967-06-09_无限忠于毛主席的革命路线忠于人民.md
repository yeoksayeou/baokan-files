Our great leader Chairman Mao has recently issued a call to support the army and love the people. This is the latest directive, the highest requirement, and the greatest concern for our army's current leftist support work. It is also the highest summary of our leftist support work over the past period. We have carefully studied Chairman Mao's call, repeatedly compared it with our actual leftist support work, and have increasingly deeply realized that: leftist support work, despite its complexity and the various problems encountered, can all be resolved as long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and correctly handle our relationship with the people.

Consciously standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and closely uniting with the people

Our army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao, and it is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and the people. In the past, during the war, wherever Chairman Mao pointed, our army fought, and victory was there. Today, in the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao instructs us to support the leftists, and our army will definitely complete the task as victoriously as in the past battles.

In the course of struggle, we deeply feel that today's battle is different from the past battles against the Americans and the Nationalists, or against the landlords, where the enemy was clear and the battle was straightforward. Instead, it is a very complex and sharp class struggle on the political and ideological front. We must maintain a clear mind and a firm proletarian revolutionary stance on this new battlefield. No matter how complex the situation, we must consciously stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is a matter of utmost importance.

At the beginning, I did not understand this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's teachings in the course of struggle, I gradually came to understand the new situation and characteristics of the current class struggle: the two sides of the battle are the proletariat, with our great leader Chairman Mao representing the proletarian revolutionary line on one side, and the bourgeoisie, with the capitalist-roaders within the party representing the reactionary bourgeois line on the other side. The capitalist-roaders within the party, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, are our most dangerous and principal enemies. The struggle between these two sides forces everyone in society, consciously or unconsciously, to stand on one of the two lines, thus producing completely opposite viewpoints, emotions, and even standards for judging good and bad.

In our leftist support work, when observing anyone or listening to anyone's opinion, we must use the viewpoint of two classes and two lines to see which line they stand on and which class's demands they reflect. The struggle in Qinghai Province is complicated, with various factions and viewpoints. However, no matter how many factions and viewpoints there are, they ultimately boil down to two factions and two viewpoints. One is the "August 18" Red Guards Headquarters and the "August 18" Red Guards Combat Team and other mass organizations standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, upholding the revolutionary viewpoint; the other is the "Red Guards" Headquarters standing on the reactionary bourgeois line, upholding the conservative viewpoint. One wants revolution, and the other wants to preserve the status quo. This is the essence of all their struggles. If we do not recognize the problem in this way, we will confuse right and wrong, mix up truth and falsehood, and make big mistakes. Comrade Lin Biao instructs us: "Without a class standpoint, one cannot see the political situation clearly, cannot decide on policies, cannot correctly implement the policies decided by the Party Central Committee, cannot judge right from wrong, and cannot serve the people."

All the big and small problems we encounter in our leftist support work confirm that Comrade Lin Biao's instruction is absolutely correct. Without the viewpoint of the struggle between the two lines, when looking at leftist organizations and conservative organizations, we will see them as equally good, each with its advantages and disadvantages, and even reverse the situation, seeing the leftist organizations as bad and the conservative organizations as good. Without the viewpoint of the struggle between the two lines, when looking at leading cadres, we will not be able to distinguish which are firm proletarian elements and which are reactionary bourgeois elements. When we analyzed the leading cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, we did not look at their positions or length of party membership, but rather at whether they stood on the side of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and socialism, or on the side opposing the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and socialism. This way, the problem became clear very quickly. From a large number of facts, we discovered that within the Provincial Party Committee, there is a small clique of capitalist-roaders who have a close relationship with the principal capitalist-roader within the party and are their loyal henchmen. Since the Cultural Revolution, these people have obstinately pursued the reactionary bourgeois line, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and ruthlessly suppressed the revolutionary masses, labeling many revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists." If these people's plot to restore capitalism succeeds, the people will once again suffer the life of cattle and horses in the old society. This is a life-and-death class struggle. If you do not overthrow them, they will overthrow you. They are the time bombs buried within us, the tigers sleeping by our side, and our most dangerous enemies, that is, our principal targets of struggle today. We saw through their counter-revolutionary nature and were not deceived by their disguises as "old cadres" and "old party members." We have extreme hatred for this small clique of class enemies and infinite love for the people. This clear distinction between love and hate enabled us to share the same feelings and language with the people and the "August 18" proletarian revolutionaries. We could understand and support their revolutionary actions. For the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, no matter how cunning they are or what tricks they play, we, together with the masses, exposed their plots and tricks in time.

In our leftist support work, we often encounter a situation where some comrades, when handling specific problems, easily take the wrong side and unconsciously stand on the opposite side of the proletarian revolutionary line. Why is this? Through positive experiences and negative lessons, we realized that this is mainly a matter of worldview and feelings for the people. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is completely incompatible with the bourgeois worldview. If proletarian thoughts dominate our minds, we will be close to the proletarian revolutionaries, and when we hear the revolutionary voices of the people, we will feel particularly on point, and our stance will be firm and our banner clear. No matter what problems we encounter, after investigation and study, we will be able to distinguish right from wrong. If bourgeois thoughts dominate our minds, we will easily accept the opinions of the conservatives, feeling that the conservatives' opinions are to our liking, and unconsciously stand on the same line as the conservatives, reversing right and wrong when observing problems.

Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." This is an absolutely true statement. To consciously stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the complex class struggle and in handling every problem, we must transform our worldview and consciously use the great thought of Mao Zedong to transform our thoughts, expelling, overcoming, and eliminating the bourgeois ideological influences from society and the family.

We must pay attention to the influence of the family. One's spouse and children, if they take the wrong side in the struggle between the two classes and two lines, must be strictly educated politically and cannot "coexist peacefully." If you do not help them return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they will pull you over to their side. The struggle within the family is a reflection of the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines in society. It is impossible to "coexist peacefully" at home and wage class struggle in leftist support work at the same time.

Many facts show that we must overthrow the bourgeois ideology in our minds and in our families, making ourselves firm proletarian revolutionary leftists, in order to better complete the leftist support task.

Breathing and sharing fate with the proletarian revolutionaries is the greatest love for the people

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries are the loyal executors of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the representatives of the interests of the broad laboring people, and the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. We love them, support them, and this is the greatest love for the people.

In the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai, there are many factions and complex viewpoints among the mass organizations. Through investigation and study among the masses and actual observation in the struggle, we decided to support the "August 18" proletarian revolutionaries. This organization was born in the midst of great storms. They firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, were the first to rebel against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, and posted the first revolutionary big-character poster; they were the first to launch a fierce attack on the reactionary bourgeois line; they were the most resolute in repelling the counter-revolutionary economic wind; they were the bravest in smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration tide. Their struggle targets have always been aimed at the principal capitalist-roader within the party and his henchmen in Qinghai.

Our support for the "August 18" is completely correct, but there are those who oppose it.

Some say, "The 'August 18' is a proletarian revolutionary organization, but why do they have such and such flaws and errors?" We say, proletarian revolutionaries are allowed to make mistakes and have flaws. There is no one in the world who is perfect, and there is no perfect proletarian revolutionary organization. The idea of demanding that proletarian revolutionaries be perfect and make no mistakes or have no flaws is metaphysical and incorrect.

Some say, "The 'August 18' has good points, and other organizations also have good points. They are all mass organizations, so why support only the 'August 18'?" We say, the "August 18" is good in every way, but the most fundamental thing is that their direction is correct; the conservative organizations are wrong in every way, but the most fundamental thing is that their direction is wrong. If we separate from the fundamental struggle between the two lines and compare who has more advantages and who has fewer flaws, we will sit on the wrong side and make a big mistake.

Some say, "The 'August 18' is a proletarian revolutionary organization, but why is their organization impure?" We say, there is no absolutely pure thing in the world. Purity is relative. The "August 18" organization has some impure elements, but compared to the conservative organizations, which are under the control of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and execute a reactionary bourgeois line, they are the most impure.

Some say, "The 'August 18' is a proletarian revolutionary organization, but why have they also 'cannonaded' revolutionary cadres? Isn't this also a problem of direction?" We say, they have always targeted the small clique. As for the past big-character posters and cannonades against some revolutionary cadres and serious errant cadres who are not capitalist-roaders, it was completely to help and save these cadres, making them firm revolutionary leftists.

The "August 18" has made important contributions in this regard. This is fundamentally different from and has a principled difference with the conservative organizations controlled by the small clique of capitalist-roaders, who, to protect the small clique, indiscriminately cannonade and strike a large area. They cannot be treated equally or mixed up.

It is in this way that we, through struggle and criticism, have increasingly firmly supported the "August 18." In the past few months, we have had experiences and lessons in our leftist support work. From these experiences and lessons, we have realized that to do a good job in leftist support work, we must grasp three fundamentals: the fundamental task, the fundamental principle, and the fundamental attitude.

Our fundamental task in leftist support is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and first of all support the leftists politically. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle." We must help the proletarian revolutionaries to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, raise their revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and march forward from victory to victory along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We are not involved in everything, grabbing everything, and taking it all in one go. If we get bogged down in trivial matters, we will easily lose our way, abandon the fundamentals, and restrict the masses' hands and feet, producing a phenomenon of doing things for others. Our initial experience in grasping the fundamentals is: firmly grasp the struggle between the two lines as the key, raise all kinds of thoughts to the level of the key, and solve them fundamentally through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively; focus on studying the situation and policies, the deeper the struggle, the better the situation, the higher the requirements for the proletarian revolutionaries, and we must keep up with the situation, grasp the policies well, and use Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various active thoughts in the implementation of policies; fully use active teaching materials and methods, popularize and promote the advanced experience of the masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively in the struggle, turning it into a common experience of the revolutionary masses; mobilize the masses, with everyone doing ideological work, the masses' ideological work cannot be done by a few people, we must mobilize the masses, with everyone propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies, timely discovering and praising comrades who implement the policies well, and criticizing phenomena that violate the party's policies; the cadres and soldiers in our leftist support work must set an example, highlight politics, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, spread the glorious traditions of our army in upholding the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, and help the proletarian revolutionaries learn the political and ideological work experience of our army.

The fundamental principle of leftist support is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. Chairman Mao teaches us: "First be a student, then be a teacher." In the great Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters and the proletarian revolutionaries are the true heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and laughable. Their revolutionary and pioneering spirit is excellent! They have deep insights and rich experience in the struggle between the two lines. Although we old soldiers are older and have more experience than the revolutionary youngsters, we may not be able to catch up with what they do and say. We must take our great leader Chairman Mao as an example and, like him, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. The Red Guards and the big link-up are creations of the masses and were also first discovered and supported by our great leader Chairman Mao. In our leftist support work, every word and deed must first consider whether it protects or restricts the revolutionary and pioneering spirit of the revolutionary youngsters. Whether arranging work, handling problems, or even when they make mistakes, we must pay attention to protecting their revolutionary and pioneering spirit. If we consciously or unconsciously restrict the development of their revolutionary and pioneering spirit, we may turn the revolution into a cold and desolate affair. We must pay attention to the fact that the more the masses trust us, the more we must respect the masses and be very humble and cautious, and never be arrogant, imposing our subjective wishes and "old experiences" on the masses.

The fundamental attitude of leftist support is to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the people's interests." Leftist support is a new subject and a new task, and the struggle is sharp and complex. We must not be afraid of making mistakes and dare to take risks, and display a fearless spirit. No matter how complex and serious the situation, we must firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionaries, sharing their breath and fate. In February this year, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, in collusion with counter-revolutionary conspirators, launched another counter-revolutionary restoration tide, brutally suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries. In such a serious situation, we once again publicly and clearly expressed our resolute support for the "August 18." The cadres and soldiers wrote letter after letter full of fighting spirit, encouraging the proletarian revolutionaries who were under attack to resolutely counter the counter-revolutionary restoration tide. Comrades Yin Huashan, Zhang Kaiming, and eleven others publicly published articles in the newspapers, affirming that the revolutionary direction of the "August 18" is correct, and resolutely supported the "August 18" in their struggle against the counter-revolutionary tide. Our support for the "August 18" directly struck at the counter-revolutionary restoration tide. The class enemies, in order to save their doomed fate, incited some uninformed masses to surround and beat us and Vice Commander Zhang Jianglin, fabricating various charges and imposing them on us. They attempted to use despicable means and high-pressure policies to force us to surrender to the counter-revolutionary tide and shake our support for the proletarian revolutionaries. We believe that at this crucial moment of life-and-death class struggle, and at this crucial moment when the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai is facing extinction, to waver is to betray, to be disloyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to be disloyal to the people. Therefore, I said: "You can kill me, you can label me a 'counter-revolutionary,' you can label my entire family 'counter-revolutionaries.' But I will never stop supporting the proletarian revolutionaries, I will never forget the people of the entire province." Our hearts are always with the "August 18," and the fighters of the "August 18" are also thinking of us. Our hearts are tightly connected with the comrades of the "August 18" revolutionary faction. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, and through the arduous struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries, we quickly smashed this heart-rending counter-revolutionary restoration tide. The proletarian revolutionaries said: "This is because Chairman Mao is standing high and looking far. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, we have gained a second life." Now, the situation of the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai is excellent and getting better. The proletarian revolutionaries have taken an absolute advantage politically and are also developing and growing stronger organizationally.

In our leftist support struggle, it is impossible not to have shortcomings and mistakes. However, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "As long as we persist in what is good for the people and correct what is wrong for the people, our army will definitely prosper." If there are mistakes, we must courageously take responsibility and resolutely correct them. The proletarian revolutionaries will definitely understand us and trust us more; not only will it not damage our army's honor, but it is precisely the maintenance of our army's honor.

Being responsible to the people, striving to unite the deceived masses and return them to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

Striving to unite the deceived masses within the conservative organizations and helping them quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is an extremely important task in the army's leftist support work. It directly relates to the implementation of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and it also relates to the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a magnificent mass movement. We need "thousands of troops and tens of thousands of horses," and we must not pursue a "lone wolf" policy. Our great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly calls on the proletarian revolutionaries to strive to unite with all those who can be united. This is the great call issued by Chairman Mao and is also the latest requirement of the reality of revolutionary struggle for the proletarian revolutionaries. The proletarian revolutionaries must unite the vast majority of the masses around them, forming a vast revolutionary army, in order to complete the historical mission of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The more deceived masses we educate and the more deceived masses we win over, the more strength we add to the revolution, the more good deeds we do for the people, the more we are responsible to the people, and the more we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

How do we strive to unite the deceived masses? We believe we must pay attention to distinguishing and solving the following three relationships:

First, the relationship between the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and the deceived masses. The proletarian revolutionaries in Qinghai Province have long been severely suppressed and persecuted by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee. These persecuted comrades harbor deep class hatred for the reactionary bourgeois line. In this situation, they often only see the masses who directly suppress them and are deceived, and do not see the backers and roots of the deceived masses. Therefore, they may produce phenomena of revenge and retaliation. We must timely guide the proletarian revolutionaries to firmly grasp the direction of struggle, use the class standpoint, see through the phenomenon of the class enemy using the masses to suppress them, see the essence of things, distinguish who is our true enemy and who is our true friend. The deceived masses are our class brothers. Although they have done this or that wrong thing, they are innocent, and they are also victims. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party is the common enemy of the proletarian revolutionaries and the deceived masses. We must help unite our class brothers and strike at the common enemy. Countless crimes, countless crimes, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party is the culprit. Countless accounts, countless accounts, all should be charged to the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. If we direct the struggle at the deceived masses, conduct collective criticism and retaliation, and engage in armed struggle, we will fall into the enemy's trap. The class enemies have long dreamed of shifting their heinous crimes to the deceived masses, making them bear the responsibility, and using them as scapegoats. We must not fall for this.

Second, the relationship between unprincipled unity and unity on a political principle basis. We help the proletarian revolutionaries strive to educate and unite the deceived masses, seeking political unity, achieving unity through struggle, and not pursuing unprincipled unity. Chairman Mao says: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon for achieving unity within the party and revolutionary organizations, making them beneficial for struggle." There have been various arguments and disagreements between the proletarian revolutionaries and the deceived masses. All these arguments and disagreements are political disagreements caused by their standing on different lines. Before the deceived masses eliminate the influence of the reactionary bourgeois line and truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, there cannot be true unity between the revolutionary masses and them. Therefore, we believe that the process of uniting the deceived masses is the process of helping the deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The deceived masses have returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and that is true unity. This is the fundamental criterion for judging whether we have united the deceived masses. If we do not recognize and handle this problem in this way, but regard the political disagreements between the proletarian revolutionaries and the deceived masses as personal grudges and general disagreements in opinion, treating the revolutionary faction and the conservative faction equally, and matching them together, we will make big mistakes. We must take the revolutionary faction as the backbone and strive to help the deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In this regard, we have had lessons. In a grassroots unit, without taking the revolutionary faction as the backbone and not paying attention to political unity, they absorbed a large number of deceived masses who had not returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into the proletarian revolutionary organization, exceeding the strength of the revolutionary faction. As a result, a change of election removed the original revolutionary core leadership. The fundamental reason for this phenomenon is the lack of sufficient understanding of the struggle between the two lines and the failure to emphasize painstaking political and ideological work. At any time, we must ensure the leading role and core role of the proletarian revolutionary faction. We must be responsible to the revolution and the people, patiently, meticulously, and one by one, help educate the deceived masses to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

How can we truly unite with the deceived masses? We must seek unity in struggle. In the great exposure, accusation, criticism, and struggle against the principal capitalist-roader within the party and the capitalist-roaders within the local party, we must distinguish between enemies and friends, draw clear lines, raise awareness, and seek unity. For the deceived masses, we must see that they want revolution and are our class brothers on the one hand; on the other hand, we must see that they have been influenced by the reactionary bourgeois line and have made mistakes. The former is the condition for us to strive to unite with them, and the latter is the reason for us to unite with them in struggle. If we only see the former, we will indulge and tolerate, vaguely pulling them over, which is not beneficial to their progress or the revolutionary cause. If we only see the latter, we will exclude and strike them, pushing them to the enemy's side, which will be "left" in form but right in essence, hurting comrades and helping the enemy. The correct approach is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use the method of handling contradictions among the people, insist on the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," use the method of rectification, persuasion and education, use meticulous political and ideological work, encourage them to stand up, express their views, support what? Oppose what? Use their actions to prove that they have drawn a clear line with the reactionary bourgeois line. We must also help them summarize the lessons from the struggle between the two lines. The deceived masses can only thoroughly expose and deeply criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, then they will infinitely love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, hate the reactionary bourgeois line, and truly unite and fight with the proletarian revolutionaries.

Third, the relationship between eliminating the influence of the reactionary bourgeois line and the issue of dissolving or not dissolving the conservative organizations. In leftist support work, should our focus be on eliminating the influence of the reactionary bourgeois line or on dissolving the organizations? From our practice, it must be the former, not the latter. We must believe in the power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and believe in the majority of the masses within the conservative organizations. As long as we insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate them painstakingly, awakening their consciousness, the masses within the conservative organizations will surely consciously rebel or withdraw and dissolve the conservative organizations.

We must focus on helping the deceived masses, encouraging them to rebel, and welcoming them to revolution. "Revolution does not distinguish between early and late," "early rebellion is welcomed, late rebellion is welcomed." Once they truly awaken and truly rebel, they will turn around and expose the dark secrets of the conservative organizations, expose the crimes of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, and accuse the reactionary bourgeois line of poisoning them. Our current general practice is: to combine the accusations and criticisms of the proletarian revolutionaries against the reactionary bourgeois line with the accusations of the deceived masses; to combine the exposure and criticism of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the local party with the exposure and criticism of the principal capitalist-roader within the party; to combine the accusations and criticisms in large meetings with individual talks and help, and the effect is very good. If we simply take coercive measures to dissolve the conservative organizations without helping the deceived masses to have a revolution in their souls and eliminate the influence of the reactionary bourgeois line, the poison will still exist, the few reactionary elements controlling the conservative organizations will not be isolated, the people behind the scenes will not be exposed, and the social base of the reactionary bourgeois line will not be thoroughly smashed.

    无限忠于毛主席的革命路线忠于人民
    青海省军区司令员　刘贤权
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近发出拥军爱民的号召。这对于我们军队当前支左工作，是一个最新的指示，最高的要求，最大的关怀。也是对我们过去一个时期支左工作最高度的总结。我们认真领会毛主席这一号召，反复对照我们支左工作的实际，越来越深刻地认识到：支左工作尽管复杂，遇到了这样那样的问题，但是，只要我们坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正确对待人民群众，一切问题都可以迎刃而解。
        自觉地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命
    路线一边，紧紧地和人民群众站在一起
    我军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，是永远忠于毛主席、忠于人民的。过去在战争中，毛主席指到哪里，我军就打到哪里，胜利就在哪里，今天在文化大革命中，毛主席指示我们支持左派，我军也一定会象当年打仗一样胜利完成任务。
    我们在斗争实践中深深感到，今天这个战斗不同于当年打美蒋、斗地主那样，明枪明刀，敌我分明，而是政治思想战线上的一场非常复杂、非常尖锐的阶级斗争。我们要在这样一个新的战场上，保持清醒的头脑，坚定无产阶级革命立场，不论遇到多么复杂的情况，都能自觉地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。这是一个头等重要的问题。
    开始，我对这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命是很不理解的。在斗争实践中，反复学习毛主席的教导，才逐渐认识到当前阶级斗争的新形势和特点：作战的双方，是无产阶级、以我们伟大领袖毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线为一方，资产阶级、以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线为另一方。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打着红旗反红旗，是我们最危险、最主要的敌人。这两个方面的斗争，迫使社会上一切人，自觉不自觉地分别站在两条路线上，从而产生完全对立的观点，思想感情，以至认识事物的好坏标准。
    我们在支左工作中，观察任何一个人，听取任何一个人的意见，必须用两个阶级、两条路线斗争的观点，看他们是站在哪一条路线上，反映了哪个阶级的要求。我们青海省的斗争是错综复杂的，有各种各样的派别，各种各样的观点，但是不论派别再多，观点再多，无非就是两种派别，两种观点。一个是“八·一八”红卫兵司令部和“八·一八”红卫战斗队等群众组织站在毛主席的革命路线上的无产阶级革命派，坚持革命的观点；一个是“红卫兵”总部站在资产阶级反动路线立场的保守派，坚持保守的观点。一个要革，一个要保，这就是他们之间一切斗争的实质。如果我们不这样去认识问题，就会是非颠倒，真假不分，犯大错误。林彪副主席指示我们：“没有阶级观点就不能看清政治形势，没有阶级观点就不能决定政策，没有阶级观点就不能正确执行党中央所决定的政策，没有阶级观点就不能判断是非，没有阶级观点就不能为人民服务。”
    我们在支左中遇到的大大小小的问题，无不一一证实林副主席这个指示是非常正确的。离开两条路线斗争的观点，看左派组织和保守派组织，会看成半斤八两，都有优点，都有缺点，甚至颠倒过来，把左派组织看成坏的，把保守组织看成好的。离开两条路线斗争的观点去看领导干部，我们就会分不清哪些是坚定的无产阶级分子，哪些是反动的资产阶级分子。我们在分析青海省委的领导干部的时候，不是看职位的高低，党龄的长短，而是看他们是站在无产阶级这一边，毛主席这一边，社会主义这一边，还是站在反对无产阶级那一边，反对毛主席那一边，反对社会主义那一边。这一来，问题就很快清楚了。从大量事实中，我们发现省委内有一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派有密切关系，是他们的忠实爪牙。文化大革命以来，这些人顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，残酷地镇压革命群众，把许多革命群众打成了“反革命”、“右派分子”。这些人复辟资本主义的阴谋一旦得逞，人民又要过旧社会的牛马生活。这是你死我活的阶级斗争，你不打倒他，他就要打倒你。他们是埋在我们内部的定时炸弹，睡在我们身边的老虎，是我们最危险的敌人，也就是我们今天的主要作战对象。我们看透了他们的反革命本质，而不被他们的“老干部”、“老党员”的外衣所迷惑。我们对这一小撮阶级敌人极端仇恨，对人民无限热爱。这种鲜明的爱和恨，就使得我们和人民群众，和“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，有了共同的感情，共同的语言，我们能够理解他们的革命行动，支持他们的革命行动。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不管他们怎样狡猾，玩弄什么花招，我们和群众一起，就及时识破了他们的阴谋诡计。　　
    我们在支左中，经常遇到一种情况，就是有的同志在处理一些具体问题中，容易站错队，不自觉地站在无产阶级革命路线的对立面去了。这是为什么呢？我们通过正面的经验和反面的教训，认识到这主要是一个世界观的问题，和对人民群众的思想感情问题。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是同资产阶级世界观彻头彻尾地不相容的。我们头脑里无产阶级思想占了统治地位，就会和无产阶级革命派亲，听起人民群众的革命呼声来，就会感到分外中肯，就会立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，不管遇到什么问题，经过调查研究，都能明辨是非。如果头脑里资产阶级思想多了，就容易接受保守派的意见，觉得保守派的意见合胃口，不自觉地和保守派站到一条线上，观察问题时也会颠倒是非。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。这是一个千真万确的真理。我们要在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，在处理每一个问题上，都自觉地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，就必须改造世界观，用伟大的毛泽东思想自觉地改造自己的思想，排斥、克服、肃清来自社会和家庭的资产阶级思想影响。
    我们必须重视家庭的影响。自己的爱人、子女，在两个阶级、两条路线斗争中，如果站错了队，要严格地从政治上进行教育，不能“和平共处”。你不帮助他回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，他就要把你拉过去。家庭的斗争是社会上两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争的反映。想一面在家庭里搞“和平共处”，一面在支左中搞阶级斗争，是决不可能的。
    许多事实说明：我们必须革头脑里资产阶级思想的命，革家庭里资产阶级思想的命，使自己成为无产阶级坚定的革命左派，才能很好地完成支左任务。
        和无产阶级革命派同呼吸共命运，是对人民最大的爱
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派是毛主席的革命路线的忠实执行者，广大劳动人民利益的代表者，文化大革命的急先锋。我们热爱他们，支持他们，就是对人民最大的爱。
    在青海文化大革命中，群众组织派别繁多，观点复杂，我们经过到群众中调查研究和实际斗争的观察，决定支持“八·一八”无产阶级革命派。这个组织是在大风大浪中诞生的。他们坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，最先造省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，贴出了第一张革命的大字报；他们最先向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火；他们最坚决地打退了反革命经济主义的妖风；他们最勇敢地粉碎了反革命复辟的逆流。他们的斗争矛头，始终是指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在青海的爪牙。
    我们支持“八·一八”是完全正确的，但却有人反对。
    有人说：“八·一八”是无产阶级革命派，为什么还有这样的缺点，那样的错误？我们说，无产阶级革命派是允许犯错误有缺点的。世界上没有十全十美的人，也不存在十全十美的无产阶级革命派。要求无产阶级革命派十全十美、不犯任何错误，没有任何缺点的想法，是形而上学的，是不对的。
    有人说：“八·一八”有好的地方，别的组织也有好的地方，都是群众组织，为什么专支持“八·一八”呢？我们说，“八·一八”千好万好，最根本的是大方向好；保守组织千错万错，最根本的是大方向错。离开两条路线斗争的根本，去比较谁的优点多，谁的缺点少，就会屁股坐歪了，犯绝大的错误。
    有人说：“八·一八”是无产阶级革命派，为什么组织不纯？我们说，世界上绝对纯的东西是没有的。纯与不纯是相对而言的。“八·一八”组织成员中是有个别不纯的，但是，比较起来，保守组织在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵下，执行了一条资产阶级的反动路线，则是最大的不纯。
    有人说：“八·一八”是无产阶级革命派，为什么也曾“炮轰”革命领导干部，这不是也有方向问题吗？我们说，他们始终打击的是一小撮。至于过去对一些革命领导干部和有严重错误但不是走资本主义道路的当权派，贴了一些大字报，轰了几炮，完全是为了帮助和挽救这些干部，成为坚定的革命左派。
  “八·一八”在这方面作了重要的贡献。这和一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的保守组织，为了保护一小撮，乱轰一气，打击一大片，是有根本区别和原则区别的，决不能同等看待，混为一谈。
    我们就是这样在斗争中批判中，越来越坚定地支持了“八·一八”。几个月来，我们在支左工作中，有经验，有教训。从经验教训中，我们认识到搞好支左工作，必须抓住三个根本，即：根本任务，根本原则，根本态度。
    我们支左的根本任务，就是宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，首先从政治思想上支持左派。毛主席教导我们说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”帮助无产阶级革命派，活学活用毛主席著作，提高革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从胜利走向胜利。我们不是什么都管，什么都抓，一揽子包起来。如果我们陷进了事务圈子，就容易迷失方向，丢掉根本，束缚群众手脚，产生包办代替现象。我们抓根本的初步体会是：紧紧抓住两条路线斗争这个纲，把各种各样的思想，都提高到“纲”上来认识，通过活学活用毛主席著作，从根本上加以解决；狠抓形势政策学习，斗争越深入，形势越好，对无产阶级革命派要求越高，必须紧跟形势，掌握好政策，用毛泽东思想回答和解决贯彻执行政策中的各种活思想；充分运用活教材、活方法，把群众在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验，普及推广，变为革命群众的共同经验；发动群众，人人作思想工作，群众的思想工作，不是靠少数人可以做好的，要发动群众，人人宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的政策，及时发现表扬执行政策好的同志，批评违反党的政策的现象；我们支左的干部战士，要以身作则，突出政治，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，传播我军坚持四个第一、发扬三八作风等光荣传统，帮助无产阶级革命派学会我军的政治思想工作经验。
    支左的根本原则，就是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。毛主席教导我们说：“先做学生，然后再做先生”。在伟大的文化大革命中，革命小将，无产阶级革命派是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。他们的革命造反精神，首创精神，好得很！他们在两条路线斗争中，体会深，经验丰富。我们这些老战士，虽然年龄比革命小将大，资历比革命小将长，但是，他们干出来的事，说出来的话，我们不见得赶得上。我们要以我们伟大领袖毛主席为榜样，象他老人家那样相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。红卫兵、大串连，都是群众创造的，也是我们伟大领袖毛主席最先发现和支持的。我们在支左过程中，每一言，每一行，首先都要考虑到爱护还是限制了革命小将们的革命造反精神和首创精神。不管安排工作，处理问题，甚至他们做错了事的时候，也要注意保护他们的革命造反精神和首创精神。如果我们自觉不自觉地限制了他们革命造反精神和首创精神的发挥，就有可能把革命搞得冷冷清清。我们一定要注意，群众越是信赖我们，我们更要尊重群众，十分谦虚谨慎，万万不可自以为是，把自己的主观愿望和
  “老经验”强加到群众头上。
    支左的根本态度，就是“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务。毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”支左是一个崭新的课题，崭新的任务，斗争是尖锐复杂的。我们要不怕犯错误，敢于担风险，发扬大无畏的精神。不论多么复杂、多么严重的形势，我们都要坚定地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，同呼吸，共命运。今年二月，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结反革命分子野心家，又一次掀起了一股反革命复辟逆流，对无产阶级革命派残酷地镇压。在这样严重的形势下，我们再一次公开明确表示坚决支持“八·一八”。干部战士写了一封封充满战斗激情的书信，鼓舞正在受围攻的无产阶级革命派，坚决反击反革命复辟逆流。尹华山、张凯明等十一个干部，公开在报纸上发表文章，肯定“八·一八”革命的大方向是正确的，坚决支持“八·一八”和反革命逆流进行了针锋相对的斗争。我们对“八·一八”的支持，直接打击了反革命复辟逆流。阶级敌人为了挽救他们灭亡的命运，挑动一些不明真相的群众，对我和副司令员张江霖同志，围斗、殴打，制造种种罪名，强加到我们头上。妄图用卑鄙的手段和高压政策，迫使我们屈服于反革命逆流，动摇对无产阶级革命派的支持。我们认为，在你死我活的阶级斗争关键时刻，在青海文化大革命面临夭折的关键时刻，动摇就是背叛，就是对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不忠，对人民不忠。因此，我说：“你们可以杀了我，也可以把我打成‘反革命’，也可以把我全家打成‘反革命’。但是，我决不能不支持无产阶级革命派，决不能忘记全省人民。”我们的心始终向着“八·一八”，“八·一八”的战士也在想着我们。我们和“八·一八”革命派同志的心紧紧连在一起。在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明决策下，在无产阶级革命派的艰苦斗争下，终于迅速粉碎了这场惊心动魄的反革命复辟逆流，无产阶级革命派说：“这是毛主席他老人家站得高，看得远。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，我们又获得了第二次生命。”现在，青海文化大革命的形势大好，越来越好，无产阶级革命派在政治上取得了绝对优势，在组织上也正在日益发展壮大。
    我们在支左斗争中，不可能没有缺点错误。但是，我们必须遵循毛主席的教导：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”有了错误，勇于承担，坚决改正，无产阶级革命派一定会谅解我们，会更加信任我们；不但不会损害我军的荣誉，而正是维护了我军的荣誉。
    对人民负责，争取团结受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来
    争取团结保守派组织中受蒙蔽的群众，帮助他们迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，是军队支左工作中，一项极为重要的任务。它直接关系到实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，也关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”无产阶级文化大革命，是一场轰轰烈烈的群众运动。我们要的是“千军万马”，绝不能搞“孤家寡人”政策。我们伟大领袖毛主席向无产阶级革命派一再提出：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。这是毛主席发出的伟大号召，也是革命斗争现实向无产阶级革命派提出的最新要求。无产阶级革命派必须把绝大多数群众团结在自己的周围，组成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，才能完成无产阶级文化大革命的历史重任。我们多教育过来一个受蒙蔽的群众，多争取过来一个受蒙蔽的群众，就是为革命多增添了一分力量，就是为人民多做了一件好事，就是对人民负责的具体表现，就是坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    怎样去争取团结受蒙蔽的群众？我们认为要注意分清和解决以下三个关系：
    一、党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和受蒙蔽的群众的关系。青海省无产阶级革命派，长期受省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的严重打击、镇压。这些受迫害的同志内心里对资产阶级反动路线埋藏着强烈的阶级仇恨。在这种情况下，他们往往容易只看到直接打击自己而又是受蒙蔽的群众，看不到受蒙蔽群众的后台和根子。因而，可能产生打击报复现象。我们必须及时引导无产阶级革命派，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，用阶级观点，透过阶级敌人假手群众迫害自己的现象，看到事物的本质，分清谁是我们真正的敌人，谁是我们真正的朋友。受蒙蔽的群众，是我们的阶级兄弟。虽然他们做了这样那样的错事，但他们是无罪的，他们同样是受害者。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽的群众的共同敌人。我们要帮助团结阶级兄弟，打击共同的敌人。千条罪，万条罪，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是罪魁祸首。千笔账，万笔账，统统记在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的头上。如果把斗争矛头，对准受蒙蔽的群众，搞人人过关，打击报复，进行武斗，人人请罪，集体请罪，正好中了敌人的奸计。阶级敌人早就幻想把他们所犯的滔天罪行，嫁祸于受蒙蔽的群众，替他们分担罪责，当他们的替罪羊。我们切切不可上当。
      二、无原则的团结与在政治原则基础上团结的关系。我们帮助无产阶级革命派争取教育团结受蒙蔽的群众，要的是政治上的团结，是通过斗争达到团结，不能搞无原则的团结。毛主席说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽的群众之间，有过各种各样的争论、分歧，这一切争论、分歧是政治上的分歧，是由于他们站在不同路线上的根本原因造成的。当受蒙蔽的群众消除资产阶级反动路线影响，真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来以前，革命群众和他们之间是不可能有真正的团结。因此，我们认为，团结受蒙蔽的群众的过程，就是帮助受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的过程。受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了，也就是真正团结起来了。这是衡量我们是否团结了受蒙蔽的群众的根本标志。如果我们不这样认识和处理这个问题，而把无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽群众之间的政治分歧，看作个人恩怨和一般的意见分歧，对革命派和保守派等量齐观，将他们撮合起来，那就要犯大错误。我们要以革命派为骨干，争取受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。在这方面，我们是有过教训的。有一个基层单位，没有以革命派为骨干，不注意从政治上团结，而把一些没有回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的受蒙蔽的群众，大量吸收加入无产阶级革命派组织，超过了革命派的力量，结果一改选，竟把原来的革命派核心领导选掉了。出现这种现象的根本原因，是没有把革命派当作依靠的骨干力量，是对两条路线斗争缺乏足够的认识，不重视艰苦的政治思想工作。任何时候都必须保证无产阶级革命派的领导作用和核心作用。我们必须对革命负责，对人民负责，耐心地、细致地、一个一个地帮助教育受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    怎样才能真正地同受蒙蔽的群众团结起来？必须是在斗争中求团结。在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和本地区党内走资本主义道路的当权派的大揭发、大控诉、大批判、大斗争中，分清敌友，划清界限，提高觉悟，求得团结。对受蒙蔽的群众，我们既要看到他们是要革命的，是阶级兄弟的一面；又要看到他们受了资产阶级反动路线的影响，犯了错误的一面。前者，是我们去争取团结他们的条件，后者，是我们必须在斗争中团结他们的理由。如果只看到前者，就会姑息迁就，稀里糊涂地把他们拉过来，那就既不利于他们的进步，又不利于革命事业。如果只看到后者，就会排斥、打击他们，把他们推向敌人一边，那就成了形“左”实右，那就伤害了同志，帮助了敌人。正确的做法是，遵照毛主席的教导，用处理人民内部矛盾的方法，坚持“团结——批评——团结”的方针，用整风的方法，说服教育的方法，用细致的政治思想工作，鼓励他们站出来，表明观点，拥护什么？反对什么？用自己的言行来证实同资产阶级反动路线划清界限。还要帮助他们总结在两条路线斗争中的教训。受蒙蔽的群众只有彻底揭露和深刻批判资产阶级反动路线，才会无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无比仇恨资产阶级反动路线，才能真正同无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起。
    三、肃清资产阶级反动路线的影响和解散不解散保守组织问题的关系。在支左中，对于保守组织，我们的工作着眼点，是放在肃清资产阶级反动路线影响上，还是放在解散组织上呢？从我们的实践来看，必须是前者，而不是后者。我们要相信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的威力，相信保守组织中群众的大多数。只要我们坚持用毛泽东思想对他们进行艰苦细致的教育工作，启发他们提高觉悟，保守组织内部的群众一定会自觉地起来造反，或者退出和解散保守组织。
    我们要着重帮助受蒙蔽的群众，鼓励他们起来造反，欢迎他们起来革命。“革命不分先后”，“早造反早欢迎，晚造反晚欢迎”。一旦他们真正觉悟了，真正起来造反了，就会大杀“回马枪”，揭露保守组织中的黑幕，揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶，控诉资产阶级反动路线对自己的毒害。我们现在的普遍的做法是：把无产阶级革命派对资产阶级反动路线的控诉，同受蒙蔽群众的控诉结合起来；把揭露批判本单位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同揭露批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派结合起来；把大会的控诉批判，同个别的交谈帮助结合起来，效果很好。如果只是简单地采取强制手段去解散保守组织，而没有帮助受蒙蔽的群众在灵魂深处闹革命，消除资产阶级反动路线的影响，其流毒就会依然存在，操纵保守组织的少数反动分子就不会孤立，幕后人也不会被揪出来，资产阶级反动路线的社会基础就不会被彻底打垮。
