China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the East China Bureau of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Sign Joint Statement

Chairman Mao is the Greatest Revolutionary Leader of Our Time

The U.S. Imperialists, Soviet Revisionists, Japanese Reactionaries, and the Revisionist Elements of the Japanese Communist Party Are the Common Enemies of the Chinese and Japanese Peoples

New China News Agency, June 3—The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the delegation from the East China Bureau of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade signed a joint statement today.

The joint statement said that the delegation from the East China Bureau of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, at the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, visited the People's Republic of China in May and June 1967. During their stay in China, both sides held friendly talks and unanimously affirmed that the "Agreement on the Promotion of Friendly Trade Between the Peoples of China and Japan," signed in Beijing on February 27 this year, is a programmatic document for the development of Sino-Japanese friendly trade. Both sides, based on the spirit of the agreement, reached a consensus on promoting friendly relations and trade between the peoples of China and Japan, especially on promoting and developing friendly relations and trade between the Chinese people and the people of the East China region.

In the joint statement, the delegation from the Japanese friendly trade association enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Both sides pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has a profound impact on the revolutionary situation in the world and has greatly inspired and boosted the confidence of the Japanese people and all revolutionary peoples in the world who are fighting. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a common victory for all revolutionary peoples in the world!

The joint statement said that both sides unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader of our time. Chairman Mao is not only the great teacher of the Chinese people but also the great teacher of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the oppressed nations and peoples to rise up and seek liberation, a powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and a common treasure of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is also the guiding light for the continuous advancement of the friendly cause between the peoples of China and Japan.

The joint statement strongly condemns the heinous crimes of the U.S. imperialists, the common enemy of the peoples of the world, in invading Vietnam, and strongly protests against the recent mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by the American bandits, as well as their brazen invasion of Vietnam's demilitarized zone, seriously escalating and expanding the war. Both sides warmly applaud the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against the Americans and national salvation.

The joint statement strongly protests against the British imperialists' savage suppression of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong in collusion with the U.S. imperialists' anti-China conspiracy.

The joint statement points out that the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Sato reactionary government, and the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party are the common enemies of the peoples of China and Japan. Chairman Mao teaches us, "The enemy will not disappear by itself," and "they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." The peoples of China and Japan can only advance the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship by waging a struggle against these enemies.

The joint statement said that Chairman Mao said, "The Japanese people are good friends of the Chinese people." The history and reality of the development of friendly relations and trade between the peoples of China and Japan have repeatedly proven that Chairman Mao's words are the absolute truth.

Both sides unanimously agreed that the development of friendly relations and trade between the peoples of China and Japan is in line with the common aspirations and interests of the 800 million people of the two countries. The fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is like the Yangtze River, unobstructed and unbreakable; it is like Mount Fuji, eternal. The various obstructionist and sabotage activities of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries can only make the peoples of China and Japan unite more closely and fight together. Both sides firmly believe that under the common struggle of the peoples of China and Japan, the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade will bloom more brilliantly!

The signatories from the Chinese side included Xiao Xiangqian and 12 others; from the Japanese side, the delegation from the East China Bureau of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade was led by Matsuoka Takeichiro and all members of the delegation. Relevant officials and representatives from the trade sector, as well as representatives from the Japanese friendly trade associations in Beijing, totaling 250 people, attended the signing ceremony.

    新华社三日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局友好商社访华代表团今天签署了一项共同声明。
    共同声明说，日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局友好商社访华代表团，应中国国际贸易促进委员会的邀请，于一九六七年五、六月间访问了中华人民共和国。代表团在中国期间，双方进行了友好的会谈，一致确认今年二月二十七日在北京签订的《关于促进中日两国人民友好贸易议定书》，是发展中日友好贸易的纲领性文件。双方并根据《议定书》的精神，就促进中日两国人民的友好和贸易，特别是就促进和发展中国人民同日本东海地区人民的友好和贸易问题，取得了一致的意见。
    日本友好商社代表团在共同声明中热情赞颂毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。双方共同指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，给世界的革命形势以很深远的影响，给斗争中的日本人民以及全世界的革命人民以巨大的鼓舞和信心。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是全世界革命人民的共同胜利！
    共同声明说，双方一致认为，毛主席是当代世界上最伟大的革命领袖。毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大导师，也是世界革命人民的伟大导师。毛泽东思想是当代被压迫民族和被压迫人民翻身求解放的强大思想武器，是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大思想武器，是世界革命人民的共同财富。毛泽东思想也是照耀中日两国人民友好事业不断前进的指路明灯。
    共同声明愤怒声讨世界人民公敌美帝国主义侵略越南的滔天罪行，强烈抗议美国强盗最近疯狂轰炸河内、海防，并悍然侵入越南非军事区，进行严重的战争“升级”和扩大战争的冒险。双方热烈欢呼越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    共同声明强烈抗议英帝国主义为配合美帝的反华阴谋而在香港野蛮镇压中国同胞的血腥暴行。
    共同声明指出，美帝国主义、苏修领导集团、佐藤反动政府和日共修正主义分子是中日两国人民的共同敌人。毛主席教导我们，“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，他们“都不会自行退出历史舞台”。中日两国人民只有同这些敌人展开针锋相对的斗争，中日友好事业才能不断向前发展。
    共同声明说，毛主席说：“日本人民同中国人民是好朋友。”中日两国人民间的友好和贸易的发展历史和现实，都一再证明了毛主席的话是千真万确的真理。
    双方一致认为，发展中日两国人民的友好和贸易，是符合两国八亿人民的共同愿望和共同利益的。中日两国人民的战斗友谊，如长江流水，挡不住，切不断；象富士山，万古长存。帝、修、反的种种阻挠、破坏活动，只能促使中日两国人民更加紧密地团结起来，共同战斗。双方坚信，在中日两国人民的共同斗争之下，中日两国人民的友好和贸易事业的花朵必将开得更加灿烂！
    在共同声明上签字的，中国方面有萧向前等十三人；日本方面有日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局友好商社访华代表团团长松冈武一郎和代表团全体成员。有关方面负责人和贸易界代表，驻京日本友好商社的代表等二百五十余人出席了签字仪式。
