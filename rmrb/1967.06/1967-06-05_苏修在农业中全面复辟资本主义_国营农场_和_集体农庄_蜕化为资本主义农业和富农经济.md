The Soviet revisionist leadership is increasingly accelerating the destruction of the socialist agricultural system in the Soviet Union and thoroughly implementing the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet countryside.

For many years, the Soviet revisionist leadership, from Khrushchev to Brezhnev and Kosygin, has implemented a series of measures to undermine the socialist planned economy, sabotage the socialist agricultural system of public ownership and collective ownership, and fully restore capitalism in agriculture.

Promoting Profit as the Guiding Principle

As early as 1955, Khrushchev changed the Soviet agricultural planning system, determining that the state would only issue procurement plans for agricultural and livestock products to the "collective farms" and "state farms" nationwide each year, while the production plans would be decided by the farms and farms themselves. In 1958, he abolished the system of compulsory delivery of agricultural and livestock products from collective farms to the state, and instead allowed farms to sell to the state and the state to purchase from farms.

The new Soviet leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin completely inherited Khrushchev's legacy. In the several sessions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the CPSU held after the new Soviet leadership took office, Brezhnev and his ilk shouted at the top of their lungs to accelerate the implementation of the so-called "new economic system" with "profit as the guiding principle." They repeatedly demanded to expand the "autonomy" and "independence" of farms and farms, to allow farms and farms to "gradually transition to completely free" sale of their own products, so as to give full play to their "initiative in choosing the most profitable (production) sectors." Implementing the "New Economic System"

In the past two years, the Soviet revisionist leadership has passed a series of resolutions to implement the "new economic system" in Soviet agriculture, which takes the level of profit as the main economic indicator. They allow all farms and farms in the country to determine their own production development direction and annual production plan according to the principle of "developing the most profitable sector." They allow farms and farms to freely dispose of their own agricultural and livestock products after completing the state's fixed procurement plan, either selling them to the state at a high price or selling them on the free market. They stipulate that "state farms" have the right to independently determine the number of employees in the farm, recruit and dismiss workers, labor productivity, product cost, form of labor remuneration, organizational form of production system, and control most of the profits they earn.

At the end of 1965, the Soviet revisionist leadership began to experiment with the "new economic system" in some "state farms" in the Soviet Union. In mid-April of this year, they passed the "Resolution on Gradually Implementing the Comprehensive Economic Accounting System in State Agricultural Enterprises," deciding to further promote this "new system" to 390 "state farms" and other state agricultural enterprises with approximately nine million employees.

Under the encouragement and promotion of the Soviet authorities, in recent years, more and more farms and farms in the Soviet Union have also implemented the system of dividing land to teams and even to households, and the system of contract production and rewards, directly dissolving the original public ownership and collective ownership in Soviet agriculture.

Promoting Free Competition

The Soviet revisionist leadership's retrograde actions have led Soviet agriculture down the capitalist road of free competition, free operation, and profit-seeking. According to Soviet publications, in the past two years, many "collective farms" and "state farms" in the Russian Federation, Moldavia, and other republics have, in order to pursue profits, "utilized" their right to formulate production plans to "arbitrarily reduce" the sowing area of the most important but low-profit crops in the region, and instead expanded the sowing area of other high-profit crops. Many farms and farms, in order to make money, "use various excuses to evade the fulfillment of" agricultural product procurement contracts, and send these products to the market for high-price sales.

In order to pursue profits, in recent years, many "collective farms" and "state farms" in various places in the Soviet Union have engaged in profitable sideline businesses and exploited hired labor. According to reports, in many farms and farms in Kostroma Oblast of the Russian Federation, workshops manufacturing rings, earrings, brooches, and other handicrafts have become the main business departments. In some farms, even during the busy farming season, the number of people engaged in sideline businesses is more than the number of people working in the fields.

    苏修在农业中全面复辟资本主义
    “国营农场”和“集体农庄”蜕化为资本主义农业和富农经济
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团，日益加紧在苏联瓦解和破坏社会主义农业制度，在苏联农村中彻底实行资本主义复辟。
    多年来，苏修领导集团，从赫鲁晓夫到勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，推行了一系列措施，破坏社会主义的计划经济，摧残社会主义农业的全民所有制和集体所有制，在农业中大搞资本主义复辟。
    鼓吹利润挂帅
    早在一九五五年，赫鲁晓夫就改变了苏联的农业计划制度，确定国家每年只向全国“集体农庄”和“国营农场”下达征购农牧产品的计划，生产计划则由农庄和农场自行决定。一九五八年，他又取消集体农庄向国家义务交售农牧产品的制度，而由农庄向国家出售和由国家向农庄收购农牧产品。
    以勃列日涅夫和柯西金为首的苏联新领导，完全继承了赫鲁晓夫的衣钵。在苏修新领导上台后召开的几次苏联最高苏维埃会议和苏共中央全会上，勃列日涅夫之流声嘶力竭地强调要加速推行以
  “利润挂帅”为核心的所谓“新经济体制”。他们一再要求扩大农场和农庄的“自主性”和“独立性”，要农庄和农场“逐步过渡到完全自由地”出售自己的产品，以便发挥它们“在选择最能赢利的（生产）部门方面的主动性”。推行“新经济体制”
    苏修新领导近两年通过一系列决议，决定在苏联农业中实行把利润水平作为主要经济指标的“新经济体制”。他们让全国农庄和农场本着“那方面赢利最多，就发展那方面的生产”的原则，自由确定自己的生产发展方向和每年的生产计划。他们允许农庄和农场在完成国家固定的采购计划后自由处理自己的农畜产品，或向国家高价出售，或在自由市场上出卖。他们规定“国营农场”有权自行确定本场职工人数、招收和解雇工人、劳动生产率、产品成本、劳动报酬的形式、生产体制的组织形式和支配自己赚得的绝大部分利润。
    一九六五年年底，苏修领导集团就开始在苏联一些“国营农场”进行“新经济体制”的试验。今年四月中旬，他们又通过“关于在国营农业企业中逐步改行全面经济核算制的决议”，决定把这种“新体制”进一步推广到拥有约九百万职工的三百九十个“国营农场”和其他国营农业企业中。
    在苏修当局的提倡和鼓励下，最近几年，苏联越来越多的农庄和农场还实行分田到组以至分田到户、包产奖励制度，直接瓦解苏联农业中原先的全民所有制和集体所有制。
    大搞自由竞争
    苏修领导集团这种倒行逆施，使苏联农业走上自由竞争、自由经营、唯利是图的资本主义道路。据苏联报刊透露，在过去两年中，俄罗斯联邦、摩尔达维亚等共和国的许多“集体农庄”和“国营农场”，为了追求利润，“利用”自己有权制定生产计划的“权利”，“任意减少”本地区最主要的、然而却赢利低的农作物的播种面积，而代之以扩大播种别的赢利高的农作物。许多农庄和农场为了赚钱，“以种种借口逃避完成”“农产品的订购合同，而把这些产品送到市场上，以高价销售”。
    为了追求利润，苏联各地许多“集体农庄”、“国营农场”最近几年大搞可以赚钱的副业，剥削雇佣劳动。据报道，在俄罗斯联邦科斯特罗马州的许多农庄和农场，制造戒子、耳环、胸针等工艺品的作坊，已经成了主要的经营部门。在有些农庄中，甚至在农忙季节，从事副业的人也比在田间劳动的人多。
