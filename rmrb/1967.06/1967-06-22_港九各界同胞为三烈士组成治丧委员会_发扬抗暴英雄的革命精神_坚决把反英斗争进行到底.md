Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots from various circles have formed a funeral committee for the three martyrs killed by the British authorities. They vow to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the anti-violence heroes and resolutely continue the struggle against British imperialism to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 21st - On the 20th, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Oppression formed a funeral committee consisting of 148 people for the three martyrs, Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming, who were killed by the British fascist authorities.

The committee's statement said: "On June 8th, the British 'Public Works Department' and the Chinese Gas Company were brutally suppressed by the British fascist authorities. The British 'riot police' opened fire on the workers at the gas company, killing Li Song and Zeng Ming on the spot. Xu Tianbo, a worker at the electric machinery factory, was arrested and brutally beaten to death by the British police at the Wong Tai Sin Police Station. This is a fascist atrocity by British imperialism that we cannot tolerate! We must express our strongest protest!"

The statement pointed out: "The British fascist gang led by David Trench deliberately and systematically planned the 'June 8th' massacre, injuring many of our revolutionary comrades and killing our three anti-violence heroes. How can the workers and patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon stand by and do nothing! We solemnly warn the British authorities: those who kill must pay with their lives! We will definitely pursue and punish the culprits! We will definitely avenge the martyrs!"

The statement said: "Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming are martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle against British violence. They were loyal to their country, loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, and loyal to the workers and patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Their fearless revolutionary spirit is worth our eternal remembrance. They are Chairman Mao's good students, outstanding fighters of the Hong Kong working class, and excellent examples for the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon! Their deaths for the people's interests are heavier than the Taihang Mountains and will forever live in the hearts of the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon."

The statement finally emphasized: "We solemnly swear to turn our grief into strength and resolutely continue the struggle against oppression to the end! We will not stop until we achieve complete victory!"

The committee also extended their deepest condolences to the families of the three martyrs and gave each family a condolence payment of 30,000 Hong Kong dollars. The committee's statement said: the issue of compensation and funeral benefits for the families of the martyrs must be fully responsible by the British authorities. (Picture attached)

    港九各界同胞为三烈士组成治丧委员会
    发扬抗暴英雄的革命精神  坚决把反英斗争进行到底
    新华社香港二十一日电港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会二十日为被港英法西斯当局杀害的徐田波、黎松、曾明三位死难烈士，成立了一个由一百四十八人组成的治丧委员会。
    各界斗委会发表的决定说：“港英法西斯当局六月八日对‘工务局’电机厂和中华煤气有限公司的疯狂镇压中，港英‘防暴队’曾向煤气公司的工人开枪射击，当场打死煤气工人黎松和曾明。电机厂工人徐田波被捕后，即在黄大仙警署中惨遭港英警察活活打死。这是港英帝国主义灭绝人性的法西斯暴行。我们对此绝对不能容忍！我们要提出最最愤怒的抗议！”
    决定指出：“港英戴麟趾一伙有预谋、有计划地制造了‘六·八’大血案，打伤了我们大批革命战士，杀死了我们的三位抗暴英雄，我港九工人和爱国同胞岂能就此罢休！我们严正警告港英当局，杀人者必须偿命，我们一定要追究和惩办凶手！我们一定要替死难烈士报仇！”
    决定说：“徐田波、黎松、曾明三位烈士是在反英抗暴斗争中英勇牺牲的。他们忠于祖国，忠于我们伟大的领袖毛主席，忠于港九工人和爱国同胞，他们不怕牺牲的革命精神，值得我们永远怀念。他们是毛主席的好学生，是香港工人阶级的优秀战士，是港九爱国同胞的好榜样！他们为人民利益而死，比泰山还重，并将永远活在港九同胞的心里。”
    决定最后强调指出：“我们庄严宣誓，要化悲愤为力量，坚决把反迫害斗争进行到底！不获全胜，决不收兵！”
    各界斗委会还向三位烈士的家属致以最亲切的慰问，并发给每位烈士的家属慰问金三万港元。各界斗委会的决定声明：关于向烈士家属赔偿和发放抚恤金的问题，必须由港英当局完全负责。（附图片）
