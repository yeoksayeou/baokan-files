The Chinese Ministry of National Defense held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the military delegation from the United Republic of Tanzania.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the military delegation from the United Republic of Tanzania.

Deputy Chief of the General Staff Peng Shaoqi and the head of the Tanzanian military delegation, the Director of the Logistics and Engineering Department of the Tanzanian People's Defense Force, Colonel Kashmiri, both spoke at the banquet.

Peng Shaoqi spoke first, representing the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in extending a warm welcome to the friends from Tanzania on the anti-imperialist front.

He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people who have already won revolutionary victory should support the struggle of the people who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty.' The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and currently engaged in a victorious Cultural Revolution, have consistently and resolutely supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. We resolutely support the struggle of the Arab peoples and peoples of all countries against American imperialism and its lackeys until they achieve final victory!"

He said, "The Chinese and Tanzanian peoples have established deep fraternal friendship in their long struggle against imperialism and colonialism, striving for and safeguarding national independence. This is a model of mutual support and cooperation among Asian and African countries in their common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and in strengthening Asian and African solidarity. This visit by the Tanzanian military delegation, led by Colonel Kashmiri, will surely further promote mutual understanding between our two peoples and our two armies, and strengthen our friendship and friendly cooperation."

Colonel Kashmiri first conveyed the greetings from the Commander of the Tanzanian People's Defense Force, Brigadier General Sharakiya, congratulating China on the successful test of its first hydrogen bomb, saying it was a great encouragement to the African people.

He said, "To develop the friendship between the peoples and armies of Tanzania and China, we have come to visit China. Our armed forces are a young army, still in the process of development and growth. Through this visit, we will learn from your rich experience."

He said, "In the struggle for the liberation of the African people, the Chinese people have already provided and will continue to provide us with great assistance, for which we are very grateful."

Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department Tang Tianji, as well as leaders from various military branches and related departments, attended the banquet.

Tanzanian Ambassador to China Mwaluko and Tanzanian friends in Beijing were also invited to attend the banquet.
