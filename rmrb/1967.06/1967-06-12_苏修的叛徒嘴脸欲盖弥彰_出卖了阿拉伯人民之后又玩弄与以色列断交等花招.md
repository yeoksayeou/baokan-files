The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists is exposed more and more clearly. After betraying the Arab people, they are now playing tricks with the idea of breaking off diplomatic relations with Israel.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, having acted as a henchman for U.S. imperialism in this war of aggression by the U.S. and Israel, has thoroughly exposed its traitorous face and fallen into unprecedented isolation. Therefore, it hurriedly played some new tricks on the 10th in an attempt to extricate itself from the dilemma.

On this day, the Soviet revisionists announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Israel; the Soviet revisionist chief representative to the United Nations, Fedorenko, suddenly acted very indignant at the Security Council meeting, feigning anger by pounding the table and cursing Israel; and a small group of people were organized to demonstrate in front of the American, British, and Israeli embassies in Moscow.

However, these tricks by the Soviet revisionists to cover up their traitorous face only serve to expose them more clearly.

The Soviet revisionists' announcement of breaking off diplomatic relations with Israel and Fedorenko's outburst are all pretenses to deceive people. The timing and reasons for their break in relations further expose their true nature as the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism. In the note to Israel, the Soviet revisionists stated the reason for the break as: "The Israeli army has ignored the Security Council's resolution to stop military actions."

People must ask: When the Israeli army was threatening war against the Arab countries, and after Israel launched a surprise attack on the Arab countries, why did the Soviet revisionists not propose breaking off relations with Israel? Why did they only do so after the Arab countries erupted in thunderous condemnation of the Soviet Union's betrayal of the interests of the Arab people? At the same time, the Soviet revisionists' note to Israel did not mention the U.S. imperialist backers of the Israeli aggressors, nor did it mention Israel's heinous crimes of launching a surprise attack, massacring Arab people, and occupying Arab land. Instead, it emphasized the "violation of the Security Council's resolution," thus exposing the Soviet revisionists' true intention of maintaining the United Nations, a tool jointly manipulated by them and U.S. imperialism, and attempting to use this tool to control the Arab countries. Therefore, according to a Reuters report, U.S. government officials believe that this posture of the Soviet revisionists will not affect U.S.-Soviet "understanding."

The purpose of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's demonstration in Moscow on the 10th is also very clear. Since Israel, under the instigation and support of U.S. imperialism, launched an aggression against the Arab countries on June 5, the people of the Arab countries, the Chinese people, and the people of other countries who truly support the struggle of the Arab people have held demonstrations and marches. However, Moscow did not hold any demonstrations, and when Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union held an anti-U.S. demonstration on the 9th, the Soviet authorities actually dispatched several thousand military police to obstruct it. The main slogan of the demonstration organized by the Soviet revisionists on the 10th was "Support the policy of the Soviet government," which clearly exposed the true intention behind the organization of the demonstration. It is also noteworthy that even such a "demonstration," the Soviet revisionists still feared offending U.S. imperialism. TASS, in reporting the demonstration in front of the American embassy, specially noted: "Moscow police maintained order in front of the embassy, and the flow of cars on the street was not interrupted."

### 苏修的叛徒嘴脸欲盖弥彰  出卖了阿拉伯人民之后又玩弄与以色列断交等花招

    苏修的叛徒嘴脸欲盖弥彰
    出卖了阿拉伯人民之后又玩弄与以色列断交等花招
    据新华社十一日讯 苏修统治集团由于在这次美以侵略战争中充当美帝帮凶，彻底暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸，而陷于空前孤立的地位，于是急急忙忙在十日耍弄一些新花招，妄图摆脱困境。
    这一天，苏修宣布了同以色列断绝外交关系；苏修驻联合国首席代表费德林在安理会会议上，突然表现得很愤慨，煞有介事地用拳头敲桌子骂以色列；纠集一小股人在莫斯科的美国、英国、以色列大使馆前面“示威”。
    但是，苏修这些企图掩盖其叛徒嘴脸的花招，结果只是欲盖弥彰。
    苏修宣布同以色列断交和费德林的咆哮，都是装腔作势，借以骗人。它同以色列断交的时间和理由本身，都进一步暴露了它作为美帝头号帮凶的真面目。苏修在给以色列的照会中说明它断交的理由是：“以色列军队无视安全理事会关于停止军事行动的决议”。
    人们要问：在以色列对阿拉伯国家进行战争威胁的时候，在以色列对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击以后，苏修都没有提出同以色列断交，为什么恰好是在阿拉伯各国爆发了痛斥苏联叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的震天怒吼之后提出来？同时，苏修在给以色列的照会中，只字不提以色列侵略者的后台美帝国主义，不提以色列发动突然袭击，屠杀阿拉伯人民、侵占阿拉伯土地的滔天罪行，而强调什么“破坏安理会的决议”，这就暴露了苏修的落脚点不过是为了维护它和美帝共同操纵的工具联合国，还是企图利用联合国这个工具来控制阿拉伯国家。因此，据路透社报道，美国政府官员认为苏修的这一姿态不会影响美苏“谅解”。
    苏修统治集团十日在莫斯科组织“示威”的目的也是很明显的。从以色列在美帝国主义唆使和支持下于六月五日发动对阿拉伯国家的侵略以来，阿拉伯各国人民，中国人民，以及其他一些国家真正支持阿拉伯人民斗争的人民纷纷举行示威游行，但莫斯科一直没有举行示威，而当亚非拉留苏学生在九日举行反美示威时，苏修当局竟然出动几千名军警进行阻挠。苏修十日突然组织的“示威”中，主要的口号又是“支持苏联政府的政策”，这就清楚地暴露了组织示威的真实用心了。还有值得注意的是：就连这样的“示威”，苏修还怕得罪了美帝国主义。塔斯社在报道在美国大使馆前面的示威时，还特别说明：“莫斯科民警在大使馆前维持秩序，大街上的汽车往来没有停止。”
