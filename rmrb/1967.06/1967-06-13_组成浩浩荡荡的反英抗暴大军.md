On June 10, employees of the Hong Kong British government institutions and workers of British-owned enterprises held a strike involving tens of thousands of people, marking the beginning of a new high tide in the anti-British anti-repression struggle. The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon have started a powerful counterattack against British imperialism!

Over the past month, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, guided by the great thought of Mao Zedong, have risen up to resist British imperialism and repression, like a surging tide, and have already dealt a preliminary but heavy blow to the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong. Now, this great struggle has developed further. This joint strike is a sign of this. The workers' struggle has moved from the previous sporadic, industry-by-industry stoppages, protest meetings, and other forms of struggle to a centralized, unified leadership under a joint strike. Thus, the momentum of the struggle is greater, the scale is larger, and the impact is more powerful.

This joint strike shows that the working class in Hong Kong is the main force in the anti-British anti-repression struggle. They stand proudly at the forefront of the struggle, bravely charging into the enemy's ranks, demonstrating the high level of revolutionary consciousness and strong fighting spirit of the working class. This strike includes workers from various important departments of the Hong Kong British government institutions and some British-owned enterprises. They have suffered deeply from the exploitation of British imperialism and have endured the oppression and bullying of the enemy. They harbor deep hatred for British imperialism and have risen up to fight against it!

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us on the eve of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan, "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a mighty revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counterrevolution."

Today, the anti-British anti-repression struggle in Hong Kong is precisely following this great teaching of Chairman Mao.

The working class in Hong Kong has risen up. The peasants and fishermen of Hong Kong are also rising up. Workers and peasants are forming a solid alliance, fighting shoulder to shoulder in a new great battle. The young students of Hong Kong have also risen up. They will combine more closely with the workers' and peasants' movements and become a powerful shock force in the anti-British anti-repression struggle in Hong Kong. All patriotic anti-imperialist compatriots from various strata in Hong Kong will rise up and be swept into this great storm of struggle. The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong are forming a mighty anti-British anti-repression revolutionary army to smash the decaying and corrupt reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

In the face of this great struggle, everyone must make their own choice and declare their stance. Some who have done bad things in the enemy's camp but are not beyond redemption should wake up quickly, turn back, and redeem their sins.

British imperialism will not die easily. It will launch a fierce counterattack against the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. It is plotting new bloody repressions against the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and attempting to use tactics such as closing enterprises and re-registering workers to divide and sabotage the Hong Kong and Kowloon workers' strike. However, we must warn British imperialism that your fascist atrocities and all your tricks are in vain. The enemy's brutality and cunning can only further inspire the fighting spirit of Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots.

The seven hundred million people of China have made up their minds to resolutely support the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong in carrying out this anti-British anti-repression struggle to the end. Every new crime committed by British imperialism against the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong will be thoroughly settled. Class struggle has its own laws. British imperialists foolishly attempt to resist the seven hundred million people of China, but the result will only be that they are crushed to pieces by the wheels of history.

The new battle cry has been sounded! The storm has arrived, and the battle formation has been set. Comrades of the Hong Kong and Kowloon workers, patriotic compatriots, unite further, organize, and form a mighty revolutionary army to launch a fierce attack on the evil British imperialism!

    组成浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴大军
    本报评论员
    六月十日，港英机构职工和英资企业的工人举行了万人联合大罢工，揭开了反英抗暴斗争新高潮的序幕。港九爱国同胞对英帝国主义新的强大反击开始了！
    一个多月来，香港爱国同胞，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，奋起反英抗暴，势如滚滚巨浪，已经给了英帝国主义在香港的反动统治以初步的然而是沉重的打击。现在这场伟大的斗争，又有了新的重大的发展。这次联合大罢工，就是一个标志。工人的斗争，已经从原来此伏彼起的、各行各业的停工、抗议集会等斗争形式，走向集中统一领导下的联合大罢工。这样，斗争的声势更壮，规模更大，具有更强大的冲击力量。
    这次联合大罢工表明，香港的工人阶级是反英抗暴斗争的主力军。他们豪迈地站在斗争的最前列，向着敌人英勇地冲锋陷阵，显示了工人阶级高度的革命觉悟和强大的战斗力。这次参加联合大罢工的，包括港英机构各重要部门的工人和一些英资企业的工人。他们饱受英帝国主义的剥削，受尽敌人的压迫和欺凌，他们怀着民族的和阶级的深仇大恨，起来向万恶的英帝国主义冲杀了！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中国人民抗日战争的前夕教导我们，“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”
    今天香港的反英抗暴斗争，正是遵循了毛主席的这个伟大的教导。
    香港的工人阶级已经起来了。香港的农民和渔民也正在起来。工人和农民结成坚固的联盟，肩并肩地展开新的伟大的战斗。香港的青年学生也起来了。他们将更加紧密地同工农运动相结合，成为香港反英抗暴斗争的一支强大的突击力量。香港各阶层一切爱国反帝的同胞们，都将起来，卷入这场伟大的斗争风暴。香港爱国同胞正在组成浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴的革命大军，去冲击英帝国主义在香港的衰朽腐败的反动统治。
    在这场伟大的斗争面前人们都要作出自己的抉择，表明态度。有些在敌人的营垒中曾经做过一些坏事而还不是不可救药的人，应该赶快猛醒，回头是岸，将功赎罪。
    英帝国主义是绝不甘心于死亡的。它还要对香港爱国同胞进行疯狂的反扑。它正在策划对香港爱国同胞的新的血腥镇压，并且企图用封闭企业，进行工人“重新登记”等威迫利诱的无耻手段，来分化和破坏港九工人的大罢工。但是，必须正告英帝国主义，你们的法西斯暴行和一切阴谋诡计都是徒劳的。敌人的残暴和阴险，只能更加激励我香港工人和爱国同胞的斗志。
    我们七亿中国人民已经下定决心，坚决支援香港爱国同胞把这场反英抗暴斗争进行到底。英帝国主义迫害香港爱国同胞的每一次新的罪行，都要一笔一笔地彻底清算。阶级斗争有它自身的规律。英帝国主义者妄想螳臂当车，同七亿中国人民相对抗，结果只能是被历史的车轮碾得粉身碎骨。
    新的进军号吹响了！风暴已经来临，斗争的阵势已经摆开。港九的工人弟兄们，爱国同胞们，进一步团结起来，组织起来，结成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向着万恶的英帝国主义进行猛烈的进攻吧！
