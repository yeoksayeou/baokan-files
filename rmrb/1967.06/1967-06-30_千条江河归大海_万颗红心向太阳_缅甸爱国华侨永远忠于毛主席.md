Ten thousand rivers flow into the sea, ten thousand hearts turn toward the sun. Overseas Chinese in Myanmar, away from their homeland, yearn deeply for the socialist motherland and hold boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They revere the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. "The waters of the I River flow from the motherland; the happiness of overseas Chinese comes from Chairman Mao." Broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese deeply feel that Chairman Mao cares most about the happiness of overseas Chinese, that Chairman Mao is the great benefactor of overseas Chinese. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who, as early as 1945, in his famous work "On Coalition Government," issued the great call to "protect the interests of overseas Chinese and assist overseas Chinese returning to the motherland."

"One rooster crows and the whole world turns bright." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people's revolutionary war achieved victory, and the great People's Republic of China was established. The status of overseas Chinese underwent a fundamental change. Yesterday, overseas Chinese were the "orphans at sea" who suffered endless bullying and oppression; today, a powerful motherland is the backing of overseas Chinese, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for overseas Chinese. Patriotic overseas Chinese recall the days of blood and tears, and look forward to this era of prevailing east winds, singing "The East Is Red" thousands of times and cheering for the great leader Chairman Mao ten thousand times! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

Today, reading Chairman Mao's books is the first need in the lives of broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese have resolved to read Chairman Mao's books for life and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

In their studies, overseas Chinese have overcome numerous difficulties. Without books, they find ways to get them. Some ask relatives in the homeland for them, some borrow from friends, some share one book between two people, some cut out and bind together Mao's quotations from newspapers and magazines, and some copy down Beijing Radio's special broadcasts on Mao's works word for word. A barber, for example, whenever he has free time, borrows and copies Mao's quotations, and now he has a thick volume.

Overseas Chinese workers are all very busy, but they all take the study of Chairman Mao's works very seriously. When there is no time, they squeeze it in. Many people can manage to study even when they are very busy. Some young teachers, as soon as they get up in the morning, read Mao's quotations aloud.

Many overseas Chinese workers and housewives have difficulty studying Chairman Mao's works because of their low cultural level, but their confidence is very high. When others explain, they listen most attentively; when they encounter difficult characters, they ask the most questions. Now many people can recite the entire text or key sentences of the "Three Articles." They are determined to imprint Chairman Mao's teachings in their minds, dissolve them in their blood, and put them into practice.

Broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese hold boundless love and loyalty for Chairman Mao. Today, in big cities and small towns in Myanmar, whether in overseas Chinese associations or in families, portraits of Chairman Mao can be seen everywhere. Last year, on the eve of the National Day of the motherland, an association obtained a large portrait of Chairman Mao and immediately found carpenters to make a frame for it. The two carpenters who were invited were overjoyed and put down all other work to accept this glorious task, working through the night to complete it. Just at dawn on National Day, they hung up the portrait of Chairman Mao, facing the rising sun. At that moment, the room was filled with light, and it looked extremely solemn and magnificent. Overseas Chinese, seeing the portrait of their leader on the festival, all felt very close and warm at heart.

More and more overseas Chinese associations are hanging up red Mao quotations boards. Overseas Chinese also regard giving Mao quotations boards as the most precious gift on festive occasions. Studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" before meetings has become a custom.

"The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and songs of Mao's quotations have become songs loved by everyone among overseas Chinese. Not only vigorous young people and students sing them, but also elderly grandmothers with white hair and toddlers learning to speak follow their older brothers and sisters singing, "The East Is Red, the sun rises..." Whenever there is a grand gathering or festival, everyone joins in, and the powerful songs echo throughout the venue, expressing the overseas Chinese's passion for loving Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we overseas Chinese will sing your praises for life. Where there are overseas Chinese, there will be voices singing about you—the red sun in our hearts. Ten thousand songs, ten thousand melodies, can never sing enough of your care and love for us, nor can they sing enough of our deep affection for you!

In many places in Myanmar, one can see spirited overseas Chinese wearing shining gold Mao badges and quotation badges on their chests. Among them, there are young people and old people; there are intellectuals, workers, and housewives. Everyone regards wearing Mao badges and quotation badges as a symbol of honor and happiness.

A group of young people, seeing Chinese experts from the motherland who came to Myanmar to help with construction and wore bright red Mao badges on their chests, were envious and requested that each of them be given one. The experts asked them to recite some of Mao's quotations, and as soon as the words were out of their mouths, everyone competed to recite them aloud. Some young people recited more than ten quotations in one breath. The relatives from the motherland praised them highly and solemnly pinned the Mao badges on their chests, fulfilling their requests.

After this story spread, whenever overseas Chinese met relatives from the motherland, they would spontaneously request to recite Mao's quotations and ask for Mao badges. Some overseas Chinese even went to an airport far from the city center, waiting for travelers from the motherland to get the Mao badges they had longed for.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is shaking the world and also bringing great inspiration and profound education to overseas Chinese in Myanmar.

The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese has reached an unprecedented height. Everyone is very concerned about this great revolutionary movement that relates to the future of the motherland and the world, and to the happiness of the laboring people's descendants for generations to come. They have repeatedly written letters to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, expressing their most enthusiastic support and most resolute support. Overseas Chinese say, "Chairman Mao is our greatest leader. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao is our sworn enemy." When the people of the motherland expose one anti-revolutionary revisionist after another and reveal the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, the news comes, and everyone is overjoyed, excited, and runs to tell each other, cheering loudly for the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Patriotic overseas Chinese, full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, excitedly say: "If it's not a song praising Mao Zedong Thought, we won't sing it; if it's not a play propagating Mao Zedong Thought, we won't perform it; if it's not in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, we won't do it."

Rivers flow to the east, the earth revolves with the sun, and overseas Chinese follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, even if the river water flows backward, even if the sky collapses and the earth crumbles, the red hearts of patriotic overseas Chinese, loyal to you and to the socialist motherland, will never change.

    千条江河归大海　万颗红心向太阳
    缅甸爱国华侨永远忠于毛主席
    千条江河归大海，万颗红心向太阳。离别祖国，旅居缅甸的爱国 侨胞，无限向往社会主义祖国，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，无限崇拜战无不胜的毛泽东思想。“伊江的流水，从祖国流来；侨胞的幸福，要感谢毛主席。”广大 爱国华侨深深地体会到：毛主席最关心华侨的幸福，毛主席是华侨的大恩人。是伟大的领袖毛主席早在一九四五年就在他的名著《论联合政府》中，发出了“保护华侨利益，扶助回国的华侨”的伟大号召。“一唱雄鸡天下白”，毛主席领导中国人民革命战争取得了胜利，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国，华侨的地位随之起了根本的变化。昨天，华侨是受尽欺凌与压迫的“海外孤儿”；今天，强大的祖国是华侨的靠山，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是华侨的指路明灯。爱国侨胞回忆那血泪交织的日子，展望这东风万里的时代，无不千遍万遍高歌《东方红》，千声万声欢呼伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！今天，读毛主席的书，是广大爱国侨胞生活的第一需要。许多侨胞下定决心，要一辈子读毛主席的书，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
    在学习中，侨胞们克服了重重困难，没有宝书，想法去找。有的向国内亲友索取，有的向朋友借阅，有的两人共读一本书，有的把报刊登载的毛主席语录剪下装订成册，还有的一笔不苟地收抄北京电台毛主席著作专题广播。有位理发工人，一有空闲就向别人借抄毛主席语录，现在已抄了厚厚一大本。
    华侨职工的工作都很忙，但是对于学习毛主席著作，都很认真，没有时间，尽量去挤。许多人都能做到事多挤不了，风雨阻不了。有些青年教师，清早起床第一件大事，就是朗读毛主席语录。
    不少华侨职工和家庭妇女因为文化水平低，学习毛主席著作有困难，但是他们信心却很高。在别人讲解时，听得最认真；遇到难字时，问得最勤。现在许多人都能背诵“老三篇”的全文或警句。他们决心把毛主席的教导印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    广大爱国侨胞对毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，今天，在缅甸的大城小镇，不论在华侨社团还是家庭里，处处可以看到毛主席的画像。去年祖国国庆前夕，有一个社团得到一张巨幅的毛主席画像，马上去找木工赶制像框。被请来的两位木工，高兴万分，他们搁下其他一切工作，接受了这件光荣的任务，彻夜赶制。就在国庆节的清晨，迎着朝阳，把毛主席画像高高挂起，一时满室生辉，显得无比庄严辉煌。侨胞们在节日里看到自己领袖的画像，心里都感到无比亲切，无限温暖。
    华侨团体悬挂红彤彤的毛主席语录牌的越来越多。华侨之间在喜庆节日时也以赠送毛主席语录牌作为最宝贵的礼物。集会前先学习《毛主席语录》，已经成为一种风气。
    《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌，在侨胞中已成为人人喜爱的歌曲。不仅朝气勃勃的青年和学生会唱，银发苍苍的老大娘也会唱，牙牙学语的小娃娃，也跟着哥哥姐姐大唱“东方红，太阳升……”。每当盛会节日，一唱百合，雄壮的歌声，震荡全场，抒发出侨胞热爱毛主席的激情。
    毛主席呵毛主席，我们华侨就是要一辈子把您歌颂，那里有华侨，那里就有歌唱您——我们心中的红太阳的声音。千支歌，万支曲，也唱不尽您对我们的关怀爱护，也唱不尽我们对您的海样深情！
    在缅甸许多地方，都可以看到神采奕奕的侨胞，胸佩金光闪闪的毛主席像章和语录章。他们当中，有青年人，也有老年人；有知识分子，也有职工和家庭妇女。大家都把佩戴毛主席像章和语录章，看作是光荣和幸福的标志。
    有一群青少年，遇到从祖国来缅甸协助建设的中国专家，看到他们胸前佩有红光耀眼的毛主席像章，羡慕极了，便要求送给他们每人一枚。专家们要他们背一背毛主席语录，话刚出口，大家竞相朗诵，有些青年一口气背了十多条。从祖国来的亲人们对他们大加赞扬，满足他们的要求，把毛主席像章郑重地别在他们胸前。
    这个故事传出以后，华侨一遇上祖国来的亲人，就自动要求背诵毛主席语录，索取毛主席像章。有些华侨甚至专程跑到远离市区十多英里的飞机场，等候来自祖国的旅客，索取他们向往已久的毛主席像章。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命震撼着世界，也给缅甸华侨带来巨大的鼓舞与深刻的教育。
    侨胞们的爱国热情空前高涨，大家对于这场关系祖国与世界未来，关系劳动人民子孙万代幸福的历史上最伟大的革命运动，十分关切，一再写信给毛主席和党中央，表示最热烈的拥护和最坚决的支持。侨胞们说，“毛主席是我们最伟大的领袖，谁反对毛主席，谁就是我们不共戴天的敌人。”当祖国人民揪出一个个反革命修正主义分子，揭露出党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的时候，消息传来，万众欢腾，人人振奋，奔走相告，为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得又一伟大胜利而热烈欢呼！
    爱国侨胞们满怀对毛主席的忠诚，激动地说：“不是歌颂毛泽东思想的歌，我们不唱；不是宣传毛泽东思想的戏，我们不演；不符合毛主席指示的事，我们不做。”
    江河向着东方流，地球跟着太阳转，侨胞照着毛主席指示的道路走。毛主席呵毛主席，那怕江水倒流，那怕天塌地陷，我们爱国华侨忠于您，忠于社会主义祖国的红心，永远不变。　·缅甸一华侨·
