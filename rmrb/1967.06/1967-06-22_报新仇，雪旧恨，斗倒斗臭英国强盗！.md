	Blood is boiling, and anger is burning. A great struggle against British imperialism and violence has erupted in Hong Kong like a volcano spewing lava! Our beloved Hong Kong compatriots have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and ignited the flames of anti-imperialist struggle.

	We, the Red Guards, resolutely support the great struggle of our Hong Kong compatriots against British imperialism and violence.

	British imperialism is heinous. The Chinese people harbor a deep, unyielding hatred for it. Today, whenever we mention the wicked British bandits, old and new grievances surge to our hearts, igniting a sky-high rage.

	As early as 1637, the wicked British imperialists arrived with their pirate ships, launching savage invasions against our country. That year, the British bandits bombarded the Tiger Gate Battery in Guangdong, sinking our merchant ships and naval vessels.

	It was this British imperialism that, starting from 1727, used ship after ship to transport large quantities of opium, using this bloodless weapon to brutally slaughter our compatriots. The blood and sweat of the Chinese people were transformed into ship after ship of silver and gold, endlessly plundered by Britain.

	The Chinese people launched a stormy anti-opium movement. In 1840, British imperialism launched a filthy and savage Opium War. However, the corrupt Qing government sought foreign favor and, under the British bandits' cannons, signed the first unequal treaty in Chinese history—the humiliating "Treaty of Nanjing" in 1842. Besides forcing "five ports open for trade" and extorting a large amount of compensation, British imperialism also occupied Hong Kong. Later, it annexed Kowloon and seized the New Territories. Our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have since suffered under the British bandits' iron hooves. Hong Kong has since become a pipe for the British bandits to suck the blood of our laboring people, a commercial and military base for the British bandits in East Asia. From then on, the insatiable British imperialists have relentlessly expanded their invasions of our country, repeatedly forcing the signing of unequal treaties, shackling our beloved motherland with the chains of semi-colonialism.

	The British bandits are not only among the earliest and most savage invaders of China but also the culprits who suppressed the magnificent Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution and brutally massacred the heroic sons and daughters who raised the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, such as the Boxers and the "Red Lanterns."

	Looking back, how many of our country's cities and beautiful landscapes have suffered from the brutal trampling of the British bandits! In 1900, the "Eight-Nation Alliance," led by British imperialism, stormed into Beijing. Burning! Killing! Rape and plunder, inside and outside the city, blood and fire filled the sky. And Shanghai, since the adventurers of British imperialism landed in 1845, has become their "paradise." The "king of foreign firms," the "king of real estate" who started with drug trafficking, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and others have sucked the blood of countless Chinese people. British imperialism in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanjing, Ningbo, Zhenjiang, and other places, has left a trail of blood debts to the Chinese people.

	For over a hundred years, the Chinese people have bravely fought against British imperialism, writing page after page of glorious chapters in the anti-imperialist struggle.

	After the birth of the great People's Republic of China, British imperialism stubbornly remained an enemy of the seven hundred million great Chinese people. It openly used the temporarily occupied Hong Kong as a base for all reactionary imperialists to carry out sabotage activities against our country and as a military base for the crazed American invaders who massacred the Vietnamese people.

	British imperialism is the most reactionary old-style invader and also the most stupid and decadent scoundrel. When the great anti-violence struggle surged in Hong Kong, it stubbornly opposed the seven hundred million Chinese people, attempting to extinguish the fighting spirit of the Hong Kong people with gradually "escalating" fascist atrocities. It even wielded batons and swords, brutally persecuting our Hong Kong compatriots, continuously creating horrifying bloodshed incidents.

	On June 8, the British imperialists brazenly used poison gas bombs to launch an armed attack on the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon. The savage massacre did not frighten the heroic patriots, and the blood of the martyrs turned into flames of revenge. As our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." The various persecutions of the British imperialists against the Hong Kong people can only force them to wage a broader and more intense struggle against British imperialism and violence.

	Old grievances and new hatreds, hatreds rise higher! All the Red Guards in China are truly burning with anger, ready at any moment to rush to the front lines of the struggle and fight side by side with our Hong Kong patriots.

	Hong Kong patriots, it is time to avenge and settle old scores, to settle accounts with British imperialism for the blood debts.

### 报新仇，雪旧恨，斗倒斗臭英国强盗！

    报新仇，雪旧恨，斗倒斗臭英国强盗！
    北京师范大学井冈山公社红卫兵
    热血在沸腾，怒火在燃烧。一场反英抗暴的伟大战斗，象熔岩飞迸的火山，在香港爆发了！我们亲如骨肉的香港同胞，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起了反帝斗争的熊熊烈火。
    我们红卫兵战士，最坚决地支持香港爱国同胞反英抗暴的伟大斗争。
    英帝国主义，罪恶滔天。我国人民对它怀着不共戴天的深仇。今天，一提起万恶的英国强盗，这旧恨新仇，马上就涌上心头，烧起冲天的怒火。
    早在一六三七年，万恶的英帝国主义就开来了海盗船，对我国进行了野蛮的侵略。这一年，英国强盗炮轰广东的虎门炮台，击沉我国商船和水师船只。
    就是这个英帝国主义，从一七二七年起，又以一艘艘海船运来大批鸦片，用这把杀人不见血的屠刀，残暴地戕害我国同胞。中国人民的血汗，化成一船船的白银与黄金，源源不断地被劫往英国。
    中国人民暴风骤雨般的禁烟运动兴起了。一八四○年，英帝国主义发动了肮脏野蛮的鸦片战争。但是，腐败透顶的清朝政府却媚外求荣，在英国强盗炮口下，于一八四二年签订了我国历史上的第一个不平等条约——丧权辱国的“南京条约”。除了强迫“五口通商”和勒索大量赔款外，英帝国主义还霸占了我国的香港。后来它又侵吞了我国的九龙，攫取我国的新界。我港九的同胞，从此处在英国强盗铁蹄的蹂躏之下。香港从此变为英国强盗吮吸我国劳动人民血汗的唧管，变成英国强盗在东亚的商业和军事基地。从此，贪得无餍的英帝国主义，就一步步地拚命扩大对我国的侵略，一次又一次地强迫签订不平等条约，把我们亲爱的祖国套上半殖民地的镣铐……。
    英国强盗不仅是最早最野蛮地侵略中国的帝国主义之一，而且还是镇压轰轰烈烈的太平天国革命、血腥屠杀高举反帝爱国大旗的义和团和“红灯照”的英雄儿女的罪魁。
    纵目了望，我们祖国的锦绣河山，我们祖国的多少城市，曾经遭受英国强盗的残暴蹂躏！一九○○年，以英帝国主义为首的“八国联军”，攻进北京城。烧呵！杀呵！奸淫掳掠，城内城外，血火冲天。而上海，自从一八四五年英帝国主义的冒险家登岸后，就变成为他们的“乐园”。无孔不入的“洋行大王”、贩毒起家的“房地产大王”、汇丰银行……，吮吸了不知道多少中国人民的血。英帝国主义在广州、福州、厦门、南京、宁波、镇江……，都欠下了我国人民累累的血债。
    一百多年来，中国人民一直英勇地进行着反抗英帝国主义的斗争，写下了一页又一页反帝斗争的光辉篇章。
    伟大的中华人民共和国诞生后，英帝国主义仍然顽固地与七亿伟大的中国人民为敌，公然利用它所暂时盘踞的香港，作为一切帝国主义反动派对我国进行破坏活动的基地，作为疯狂屠杀越南人民的美国侵略者的军事活动基地。
    英帝国主义是最反动的老牌侵略强盗，也是个最愚蠢最腐朽的家伙。当伟大的抗暴斗争在香港风起云涌的时候，它顽固地与七亿中国人民为敌，妄图用逐步“升级”的法西斯暴行扑灭香港人民的斗争怒火。它竟然挥舞起警棍屠刀，血腥迫害我香港同胞，接连地制造了骇人听闻的流血事件。
    六月八日，英帝国主义者悍然用毒气弹，向我港九工人发动武装进攻。野蛮的屠杀吓不倒英雄的爱国同胞，志士的鲜血化作复仇的火焰。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”英帝国主义者对香港人民的种种迫害，只能迫使他们进行更广泛更剧烈的反英抗暴斗争。
    旧恨加新仇，仇恨倍增高！我们全中国的红卫兵战士真是怒火中烧，时刻准备奔赴斗争第一线，与我香港爱国同胞并肩战斗。
    香港爱国同胞们，是报仇雪恨的时候了，是对英帝国主义彻底清算血债的时候了。
