Correctly Treating Oneself

The proletarian revolutionary faction, after seizing power, must correctly treat themselves. This is a very important issue.

To correctly treat oneself, one must first correctly view the achievements we have already made. "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come out to praise us." At this time, we must heighten our vigilance. For having done a few good things in the past, we must attribute all achievements to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and all honors to the great leader Chairman Mao. We followed Chairman Mao's words, executed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, relied on the broad revolutionary masses, and made some contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause. However, our eyes must look forward. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road have not been thoroughly defeated, the revolution is not yet complete, and a fierce class struggle still lies before us. We must not relax our revolutionary spirit. We must firmly grasp the main contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, in order to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The more the masses praise us, the more we must have the masses in our hearts. The more the masses support us, the more we must be with the masses. As leaders of a revolutionary mass organization, no matter how great our abilities, no matter how great our past contributions, we must always be students and ordinary people before the masses. We must never act superior or put on airs. The masses are always wiser than us, and we should not always think of ourselves as being so wise. Only by being among the masses can we correctly treat ourselves.

We must see our past achievements, but we must also see the shortcomings and mistakes in our work. Not everything is good; there are still shortcomings and mistakes. Due to lack of experience, we will inevitably make various shortcomings and mistakes in the struggle, which is a normal thing. However, we must face these shortcomings and mistakes. We must not think that we are always one hundred percent right, and others are always one hundred percent wrong, and not allow others to criticize us. Some comrades say, "Our general direction is correct." Yes, our general direction is correct, but we cannot use this reason to suppress others' opinions. Precisely because the general direction is correct, we should welcome others' criticisms, including those who have criticized us. The general direction is correct, and by listening to the masses' criticisms and correcting our shortcomings and mistakes, we will only be better at adhering to the revolutionary general direction and holding and using the power given to us by the people more firmly and well. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "If we improve our style of work, we will be more active in our work, our abilities will be greater, and our work will be done better."

Will the proletarian revolutionary faction's humbly listening to and accepting the masses' criticisms affect their prestige? No. On the contrary, this will only increase our prestige. Prestige is not gained by suppressing others' criticisms. Prestige without credibility is not true revolutionary prestige. We must establish proletarian revolutionary authority in the struggle. The facts prove that any revolutionary mass organization and its leaders, as long as they seriously and not perfunctorily accept the masses' criticisms and correct their shortcomings and mistakes, their prestige among the masses will not decrease but will only grow higher and higher.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be rich in the spirit of self-criticism, and be brave in correcting the shortcomings and mistakes in our work." True proletarian revolutionaries must learn to listen to different opinions. Even if the opinions sound unpleasant, we must listen patiently and endure them. We must analyze them and be good at absorbing the reasonable parts. If contradictions arise between revolutionary mass organizations, we must make more self-criticisms, see more of the main aspects of the other side, and not immediately negate everything about the other side. We must not easily label others' correct criticisms as "attempts to overthrow us." Making more self-criticisms, even if there are principled differences, will not be difficult to resolve. If both sides lack the spirit of self-criticism and only blame others without criticizing themselves, then contradictions that are not difficult to resolve will become more and more entrenched, and may even lead to splits.

Here, we particularly hope that comrades who have made some mistakes or serious mistakes in the past will correctly treat themselves. Having made mistakes in the past, do not carry them as a burden; but you must recognize the mistakes, learn from the lessons, correct the mistakes, and keep up with the situation. The criticisms made by comrades in the past were out of goodwill to help, and you must not find any reason to cover up your mistakes. If you do, it will be difficult to handle the situation, you may continue to make mistakes, and you will fall behind, disappointing the broad revolutionary masses' expectations.

The proletarian revolutionary faction must continuously make new achievements. We must not rely on past merits. Relying on past merits will inevitably lead to falling behind and being left out. We believe that under the new revolutionary situation, the proletarian revolutionary faction, as long as they correctly treat themselves, correctly treat their comrades, correctly treat the masses, firmly follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely and unconditionally execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions, will definitely continuously make new achievements for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

### 正确地对待自己

    正确地对待自己
    《文汇报》六月十二日社论
    无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，怎样正确对待自己，这是一个很重要的问题。
    正确对待自己，首先要正确看待我们过去已取得的成绩。“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。”这时，我们更要提高警惕。过去办了几件好事，我们一定要把一切成绩归功于毛主席的革命路线，一切荣誉归功于伟大领袖毛主席。我们过去听了毛主席的话，执行了毛主席的革命路线，依靠了广大革命群众，为无产阶级革命事业作出了一些贡献。但是，我们的眼睛必须朝前看。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派没有被彻底打倒，革命尚未成功，摆在我们面前还有一场激烈的阶级斗争。我们切切不可松懈自己的斗志。我们只有紧紧抓住无产阶级和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的主要矛盾，才能将文化大革命进行到底。
    群众越是赞扬我们，我们心目中越要有群众。群众越是支持我们，我们越要和群众在一起。作为一个革命群众组织的负责人，不管能力多大，不管过去作出了多大的贡献，在群众面前，我们永远永远是小学生，永远永远是普通的老百姓，切切不可摆起架子来，拉起官腔来。群众总是比我们高明，而不要经常想我是多么高明。永远在群众之中，才能正确地对待自己。
    我们要看到过去的成绩，但还要看到我们的工作中有缺点和错误。不是一切都好，还有缺点和错误。由于缺乏经验，我们必定会在斗争中产生这样那样的缺点和错误，这是正常的事。但是，我们必须正视这些缺点和错误。不要认为自己总是百分之一百都对，人家总是百分之一百都错，不准人家批评自己。有的同志说，“我们的大方向是正确的”。是的，我们的大方向是正确的，但不能用这条理由去压制人家提意见。正因为大方向是正确的，就更应该欢迎别人的批评，包括反对过自己的人的批评。大方向是正确的，听取了群众的批评，改正了我们的缺点和错误，只会使我们更好地坚持革命的大方向，把人民交给我们的权掌得更牢用得更好。正如毛主席指出的：“如果我们把作风整顿好了，我们在工作中间就会更加主动，我们的本事就会更大，工作就会做得更好。”
    无产阶级革命派虚心听取、接受群众的批评，会不会影响自己的威信呢？不会的。相反，这只会增加我们的威信。威信不是靠压制别人的批评取得的。威而无信，不是真正的革命的威信。我们要在斗争的过程中，树立起无产阶级的革命的权威。事实证明，任何一个革命群众组织及其负责人，只要认真地而不是敷衍地接受了群众的批评，改正了缺点和错误，那么，他在群众中的威信，决不会降低，而只会越来越高。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误。”真正的无产阶级革命派必须学会听取不同的意见，即使意见听起来不顺耳，也要耐着性子听，硬着头皮听。听了要作分析，善于从中吸取合理的部分。在革命群众组织之间，如果双方产生了矛盾，更需要多作自我批评，多看到对方的主流，不要一开口就否定对方的一切，不要动不动就把人家的正确批评说成“整垮我们”。多作自我批评，即使是有原则的分歧，也不难解决。双方如果都缺乏自我批评精神，只指责别人，不批评自己，那么，本来不难解决的矛盾，也会越弄越僵，甚至导致分裂。
    这里，我们还特别希望那些过去犯过一些错误或严重错误的同志，更应正确对待自己。过去犯了错误，不要当作包袱背；但是，一定要认识错误，吸取教训，改正错误，跟上形势。同志们以前所作的批评是出于善意的帮助，决不要再去找一条什么理由，掩饰自己的错误。这样，事情就不好办了，就可能继续犯错误，就要继续落后，辜负了广大革命群众的期望。
    无产阶级革命派要不断立新功。我们千万不要吃老本。坐吃老本，非落后不可，非掉队不可。我们相信，在新的革命形势下，无产阶级革命派只要正确对待自己，正确对待战友，正确对待群众，紧跟毛主席的革命路线，对毛主席的最新指示，要坚决地执行，无条件地执行，就一定能不断为无产阶级革命事业立新功。
