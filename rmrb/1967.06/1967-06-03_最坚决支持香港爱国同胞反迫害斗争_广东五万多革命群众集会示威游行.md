More than 500,000 revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a rally and demonstration to support the struggle of Hong Kong patriots against persecution.

The rally was held at the Guangdong Provincial Stadium. The revolutionary warriors of the proletariat were all spirited, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and raising their arms to shout: "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Firmly support the struggle of Hong Kong patriots against persecution!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with British imperialism, the running dog of U.S. imperialism!" "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" "Seven hundred million people swear to be the strong backing of Hong Kong patriots!"

The rally began with the song "The East Is Red." The rally issued a letter to the people of the entire province and a telegram of support to Hong Kong patriots, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and firmly supporting the just struggle of Hong Kong patriots against persecution.

A worker representative spoke, saying that Hong Kong patriots, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are engaged in an unyielding struggle against the enemy, displaying great heroism and resolutely fighting against the enemy. This greatly boosts the morale of the Chinese people and strikes a heavy blow to British imperialism. He pointed out: "We Guangdong workers have a close relationship with Hong Kong patriots and have established a combat friendship during the 'Provincial-Hong Kong Strike' struggle. We swear to be the strong backing of Hong Kong patriots and will carry the just struggle against persecution to the end."

A revolutionary peasant representative from the suburbs of Guangzhou first expressed a thousand times support and ten thousand times support for the just struggle of Hong Kong patriots against persecution. He also pointed out that as early as the Opium War, British imperialism was already our defeated enemy. Today, the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with a glorious anti-imperialist, patriotic tradition are even more formidable! If British imperialism insists on its course, it will surely reap what it has sown.

A Red Guard spoke, saying that Hong Kong patriots are our flesh and blood, and their hearts are connected with ours. The Hong Kong British authorities bullying our patriots is absolutely unacceptable. She warned the Hong Kong British authorities that if they insist on continuing to be enemies of our Hong Kong patriots and the seven hundred million Chinese people, they will surely meet a bad end.

A patriot representative who had just returned from the front lines of the struggle against persecution in Hong Kong spoke amid warm applause. He introduced the situation where Hong Kong patriots, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly fought against the fascist thugs of the Hong Kong British authorities. He said that with Chairman Mao's leadership and the support of seven hundred million people in the motherland, Hong Kong patriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely achieve a complete victory.

A representative of the proletarian revolutionary faction in the news industry strongly condemned the Hong Kong British authorities for violating the freedom of news reporters and unjustly assaulting our patriotic reporters who were conducting coverage activities. He said: The fact that the Hong Kong British authorities assaulted our patriotic reporters only shows that they are afraid of the truth and afraid that our patriotic reporters will expose their fascist atrocities. However, we warn the Hong Kong British authorities that the truth cannot be suppressed, and the facts cannot be covered up.

After the rally, a demonstration march was held.

    最坚决支持香港爱国同胞反迫害斗争 
    广东五万多革命群众集会示威游行
    新华社广州二日电　广东省、广州市五万多革命工人、农民、红卫兵小将和机关革命干部，今晚举行支援香港爱国同胞反迫害斗争委员会成立大会，愤怒声讨港英当局镇压香港爱国同胞反迫害斗争的罪行。
    大会在广东省人民体育场举行。无产阶级革命派战士个个精神抖擞，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，振臂高呼：“强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行！”、“坚决支持香港爱国同胞的反迫害斗争！”、“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒美帝帮凶英帝国主义！”、“血债要用血来还！”、“七亿人民誓作香港爱国同胞的坚强后盾！”
    大会在《东方红》的歌声中开始。大会发出告全省人民书和给香港爱国同胞的支持电，最强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行，最坚决支持香港爱国同胞的反迫害正义斗争。
    革命工人代表在讲话中说，香港爱国同胞以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为武器，和敌人展开针锋相对的不屈不挠的斗争，以大无畏的英雄气概，和敌人进行坚决斗争，大长中国人民的志气，大灭英帝国主义的威风。他指出：“我们广东工人和香港爱国同胞有着密切的关系，有着在‘省港大罢工’斗争中已经建立起来的战斗友谊。”我们誓作香港爱国同胞的坚强后盾，把反迫害正义斗争进行到底。
    广州郊区革命农民代表在发言中首先对香港爱国同胞反迫害的正义斗争表示一千个支持，一万个支持！同时指出，早在鸦片战争的时候，英帝国主义就是我们的手下败将，而今天用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有反帝爱国光荣传统的革命人民，更是不好惹的！英帝国主义如果一意孤行，那么必将自食其恶果。
    红卫兵小将在讲话中说，香港爱国同胞是我们的亲骨肉，和我们心连心，港英当局欺负我爱国同胞是绝对办不到的。她警告港英当局，如果一意孤行，继续同我香港爱国同胞为敌，同七亿中国人民为敌，那就一定没有好下场。
    刚刚从香港反迫害斗争前线回到广州的爱国同胞代表在热烈掌声中讲话。他介绍了香港爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不畏强暴，同港英当局的法西斯暴徒进行英勇斗争的情况。他说，有毛主席的领导，有祖国七亿人民的支持，用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九爱国同胞，一定会取得彻底的胜利。
    新闻界无产阶级革命派代表在讲话中强烈谴责港英当局破坏新闻记者采访自由，无理殴打在场进行采访活动的我爱国记者。他说：港英当局殴打我爱国记者这一事实，只能说明港英当局害怕真理，害怕我爱国记者如实地揭露他们的法西斯暴行的真相。但是我们要警告港英当局，真理是扼杀不了的，事实是掩盖不住的。
    会后进行了示威游行。
