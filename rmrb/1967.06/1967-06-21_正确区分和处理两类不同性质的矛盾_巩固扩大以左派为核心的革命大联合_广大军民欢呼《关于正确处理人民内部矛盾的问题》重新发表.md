The masses of revolutionary people across the country, with hearts filled with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly commemorated the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

Today, 58 colleges and universities and over 120 organizations of revolutionary teachers and students in the capital gathered together. The Red Guards spoke enthusiastically about their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work. They said, "We must use this powerful ideological weapon to analyze and handle the two types of contradictions, consolidate and expand the revolutionary great alliance with the leftists as the core, unite all those who can be united, and direct the spearhead of struggle uncompromisingly at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

At the grand commemorative meeting held by the proletarian revolutionary masses in Taiyuan today, Liu Guan, deputy head of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, emphasized in his speech that Chairman Mao's great work is the most powerful ideological weapon to prevent the restoration of capitalism and is an extremely important guide for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must firmly grasp the direction of struggle. Any action that reverses the enemy-ours relationship, confuses the main and secondary contradictions, and directs the spearhead of struggle at our comrades and fellow fighters is against the direction of struggle and is wrong.

On the 19th, over 40,000 people in Shandong Province and Jinan City held a grand commemorative rally. Wang Xiaoyu, head of the Shandong Revolutionary Committee, said in his speech at the meeting, "One important task facing our revolutionary committees at all levels and various revolutionary mass organizations is to honestly and seriously study and use this great work as a guide to rectify our work style, raise our revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, and enhance the combat effectiveness of our revolutionary forces, concentrating our efforts to criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." Yang Dezhi, a responsible comrade of the Jinan Military Region, also spoke at the meeting. He said, "How to correctly handle various contradictions among the people that arise in the revolutionary struggle is a very important issue. If this issue is handled properly, it can continuously develop and strengthen our leftist forces, achieve and consolidate the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and to the greatest extent isolate and strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary masses and the military personnel of Qinghai Province held a grand celebration on the 19th. Lin Shan, deputy political commissar of the Qinghai Military Region, emphasized in his speech at the meeting that we must seriously study and deeply understand the brilliant thoughts in Chairman Mao's great work, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and always direct the spearhead of struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. A representative of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebel Alliance Committee of Qinghai Province also spoke at the meeting.

On the 19th, over 100,000 people in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held a grand commemorative rally. The representative of the Red Guard Revolutionary Rebel Command of Hohhot's colleges and universities said at the meeting, "Towards the enemy, towards the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must expose them, overthrow them, and establish dictatorship over them; towards the contradictions among the people, we must correctly use the formula of 'unity-criticism-unity' to resolve them." Wu Tao, political commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military Region and deputy head of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, also spoke at the meeting. He emphasized, "We must use Chairman Mao's great work as the most powerful ideological weapon, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, unite all those who can be united, and fiercely strike at the enemy, smashing all conspiracies of the domestic and foreign class enemies at any time."

In the past few days, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people in other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have also held various commemorative activities and seriously studied this brilliant work.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army of China, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unanimously expressed in their in-depth study of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that Chairman Mao's judgments on the existence of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society, and his brilliant thoughts on correctly distinguishing and handling contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people, are extremely important Marxist-Leninist principles that must be lectured on year after year, month after month, and day after day, remembered in mind, and implemented in action. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly grasping this brilliant thought is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, with the publication of the editorial in the 10th issue of "Red Flag" magazine, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have pushed the activities of commemorating and studying the re-issuance of Chairman Mao's brilliant work to a new high. The military regions in Shenyang, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu held commemorative meetings, symposiums, and experience-sharing meetings respectively. Many soldiers and officers in the "Three Supports, Two Military" front lines in Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Qinghai, and Guizhou gathered with the proletarian revolutionary masses to discuss their learning experiences. The Navy Party Committee issued learning instructions to its subordinate units, and many soldiers and officers in the Air Force made learning plans. In recent days, on the coastal and border defense lines in Fujian, Yunnan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, the soldiers have been reviewing Chairman Mao's brilliant work with boundless joy.

    全国其他各省、市、自治区的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，这几天也都举行了各种各样的纪念活动，并且认真地学习了这篇光辉著作。
    据新华社二十日讯　无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的中国人民解放军陆海空三军指战员，在深入学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作时，一致表示：毛主席关于社会主义社会存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的论断，关于正确区分和处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的光辉思想，是极其重要的马列主义原理，必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，铭记在脑子里，落实在行动中。在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，牢牢掌握这一光辉思想，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利的根本保证。
    今天，随着《红旗》杂志第十期社论的发表，广大指战员把纪念和学习毛主席这一光辉著作重新发表的活动推向了新的高潮。沈阳、北京、南京、广州、成都等部队分别举行了纪念会、座谈会和讲用会。黑龙江、山东、山西、青海、贵州等地驻军许多在“三支”“两军”战线上的指战员，同无产阶级革命派欢聚一堂，畅谈学习心得体会。海军党委向所属部队发出了学习指示，空军部队许多指战员订出了学习计划。在福建、云南、西藏、新疆、内蒙古等海防、边防线上，连日来，指战员们怀着无比喜悦的心情，重温毛主席这一光辉著作。
