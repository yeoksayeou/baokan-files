Johnson Advocates Strengthening "Joint Action" Between Soviet Revisionists and the U.S. Imperialists

U.S. Reports Reveal U.S.-Soviet Leaders to Make "Package Deal" on Vietnam, Middle East and Other Issues

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 20th: Washington news: On the 19th, one hour before the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin was scheduled to speak at the emergency session of the United Nations, U.S. President Johnson delivered a speech on U.S. foreign policy, vigorously advocating strengthening collusion with the Soviet revisionists and expanding the areas of "joint action" with them. He also boasted that the U.S. would "peacefully resolve" issues such as Vietnam and the Middle East according to its own wishes.

Johnson eagerly pushed for the Soviet revisionist group to further collude with U.S. imperialism, loudly proclaiming that he was "very concerned about improving relations between the Western world and the Eastern European countries," and that it was "extremely important" for the U.S. to adopt a "patient policy" towards these countries for its so-called "security."

Johnson said that the U.S. had been "striving to expand the areas of joint action with the Soviet Union and had made tremendous progress in this regard." In this regard, he listed a series of deals made between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the past half year, such as signing cultural exchange agreements, civil aviation agreements, consular treaties, and outer space treaties, and expressed the hope that agreements would be "quickly" reached on issues such as "preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons" and establishing anti-ballistic missile systems. At a time when Kosygin was rushing to the U.S. and officials of the two countries were busily preparing for the Kosygin-Johnson talks, Johnson delivered such a speech, which was obviously intended to encourage the Soviet revisionist leadership to further align with the U.S. and serve its interests.

On the issue of Vietnam, the desperate Johnson reiterated the U.S.'s counter-revolutionary strategy of "peace and war": on the one hand, he threatened: "We are prepared to try to gradually reduce the level of fighting," while on the other hand, he emphasized that the U.S. could not abandon its "obligations to the people of South Vietnam." Those familiar with Johnson's jargon know that his so-called "gradual reduction" refers to inducing the Vietnamese people to "gradually surrender"; while his so-called not abandoning "obligations to the people of South Vietnam" means that the U.S. will insist on occupying South Vietnam.

Various signs indicate that plotting new conspiracies on the Vietnam issue is one of the main topics of Johnson's talks with Kosygin. After the news of Kosygin's visit to the U.S. was released, U.S. newspapers, and even officials, have been revealing that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are planning a "package deal" on issues such as Vietnam and the Middle East; there are also reports that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are secretly plotting a new "bombing halt and surrender" trick on the Vietnam issue.

Johnson emphasized the Middle East issue in his speech. After the U.S. and the Soviet Union colluded to manipulate the United Nations to recognize the fait accompli of the U.S.-British-Israeli aggression against Arab countries, this U.S. imperialist leader completely discarded the "neutral" disguise and viciously attacked the invaded Arab countries. He attacked the Egyptian blockade of the Strait of Tiran as a "tyrannical and dangerous" action and, with the logic of a robber, said that no action was more responsible for the outbreak of this war than this one.

While expressing support for Israel's demand to expand its territory on the pretext of the conflict, Johnson proposed so-called "five principles" for "solving" the Middle East problem, openly forcing Arab countries to submit to aggression and accept a series of humiliating conditions in exchange for Israel's withdrawal. This purpose of the "five principles," which aims to consolidate and expand U.S. aggression in the Middle East, is to force the Arab people to recognize the legitimacy of the U.S.-British aggression tool Israel and allow it to violate the sovereignty of Arab countries, freely use the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba; at the same time, under the pretext of "limiting the arms race," it does not allow Arab countries to arm themselves for self-defense, so that Israel can maintain its military superiority. He blatantly threatened the Arab countries, saying that if they did not accept these "principles," they would "make their own people pay a terrible price."

Johnson also emphasized that he would continue to use the U.S.-Soviet-controlled "United Nations" to serve U.S. aggression in the Middle East. He vigorously advocated the "fire-fighting" role of the United Nations in the Middle East, shouting that the U.S. "first supports the United Nations' effective mediation activities" in the Middle East situation. His remarks immediately received a response from Kosygin.

### 约翰逊鼓吹苏修美帝加强“共同行动”  美报透露美苏首脑要在越南中东等问题上做“一揽子交易”

    约翰逊鼓吹苏修美帝加强“共同行动”
    美报透露美苏首脑要在越南中东等问题上做“一揽子交易”
    据新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：十九日，在苏修头目柯西金预定在联大紧急会议上讲话的前一个钟头，美国总统约翰逊发表了一篇关于美国外交政策的演说，大力鼓吹加强同苏修的勾结，扩大同苏修“采取共同行动的领域”，并且叫嚷按照美帝的如意算盘“和平解决”越南、中东等问题。
    约翰逊竭力促使苏修集团进一步同美帝勾结，大肆宣扬，他“很关心改善西方世界和（苏联）东欧国家之间的关系”，他认为，对这些国家执行“耐心的方针”，对美国的所谓“安全”是“极为重要的”。
    约翰逊说，美国一直“力图扩大同苏联采取共同行动的领域，而且在扩大这种领域方面取得了巨大的进展”。在这方面，他列举了最近半年以来，美苏之间所作成的一系列交易，如签定文化交流协定、民航协定、领事条约及外层空间条约等等，并且表示希望，在所谓“防止核武器扩散”及有关建立反弹道导弹体系问题上，双方会“很快”达成协议。在柯西金风尘仆仆亲自跑到美国，两国官员正紧张地为柯西金—约翰逊会谈进行准备的时候，约翰逊发表这样一篇演说，显然是为了鼓励苏修领导集团进一步投靠美国、为美国效劳。
    在越南问题上，焦头烂额的约翰逊重申了美国的反革命“和”战两手策略：他一方面扬言：“准备好设法共同使战斗逐步降级”，同时强调美国不能放弃“对南越人民的义务”。熟悉约翰逊的黑话的人都知道：他所谓的“逐步降级”，就是指诱使越南人民“逐步投降”；而所谓不放弃“对南越人民的义务”，就是说美国要坚持侵占南越。
    种种迹象表明，在越南问题上策划新的阴谋，正是约翰逊要同柯西金会谈的主要内容之一。在柯西金访美的消息传出之后，美国报刊，甚至官方人士一直在透露，美苏策划就越南、中东等问题搞一个“一揽子交易”；还有消息说，美苏正密谋在越南问题上玩弄一次新的“停炸诱降”骗局。
    约翰逊在演说中着重谈了中东问题。图穷匕首见，在美苏合谋操纵联合国确认了美英以侵略阿拉伯国家所造成的既成事实之后，这个美帝国主义头子完全抛掉了“中立”的伪装，穷凶极恶地攻击受侵略的阿拉伯国家。他攻击阿联封锁蒂朗海峡是一个“专横的、危险的”行动，并且满口强盗逻辑说没有什么行动比这一行动“对这次战争的爆发负有更大的责任”。
    约翰逊在表示支持以色列借机扩张其领土的要求的同时，提出了所谓“解决”中东问题的“五大原则”，明目张胆地逼迫阿拉伯国家屈从侵略，接受一系列屈辱的条件来换取以色列撤军。这个目的在于巩固和扩大美帝在中东的侵略势力的“五大原则”，就是要迫使阿拉伯人民承认美英侵略工具以色列的合法存在，并且让它侵犯阿拉伯国家主权，自由使用苏伊士运河及亚喀巴湾；同时，在所谓“限制军备竞赛”的幌子下，不许阿拉伯各国武装自卫，使以色列得以在军事方面保持它的优势。他露骨地威胁阿拉伯国家说，如果它们不接受这些“原则”，就会“使它们自己的人民付出可怕的代价”。
    约翰逊还强调表示，要继续利用美苏控制的“联合国”来为美国侵略中东服务。他竭力鼓吹“联合国”的中东的“灭火”作用，叫嚷美国“首先支持联合国（在中东局势中）作出有效的谋和活动”。他的这番话立即就得到了柯西金的响应。
