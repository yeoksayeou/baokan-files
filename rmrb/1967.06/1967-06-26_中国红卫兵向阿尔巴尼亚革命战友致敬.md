Chinese Red Guards Pay Tribute to Albanian Revolutionary Comrades
Tirana Welcomes Chinese Red Guards with Enthusiastic Slogans of "Long Live the Red Guards!"
Comrade Yao Wenyuan Thanks Albanian People for Their Warm Support of China's Cultural Revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, on June 24, a delegation of Chinese Red Guards, led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, visited the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory and the memorial halls of the founding of the Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian Union of Labor Youth, accompanied by leaders including the First Secretary of the Albanian Union of Labor Youth, Comrade Mero. They were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Albanian people.

On the same day, Chinese Ambassador to Albania, Liu Xiao, also accompanied the delegation during their visit.

The Chinese Red Guards delegation was warmly received by the workers of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory, including the factory director, Piristri, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor. After the delegation toured the factory, the workers held a grand welcoming rally. The venue was adorned with large portraits of the great leaders of the peoples of China and Albania, Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha. The Vice Secretary of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory Committee of the Albanian Union of Labor Youth, Bruci, and the leader of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, Comrade Yao Wenyuan, both spoke at the rally.

Yao Wenyuan first extended proletarian revolutionary greetings on behalf of the Chinese Red Guards delegation to all the workers of the factory. He said, "This is the first time that the Chinese Red Guards have sent representatives abroad to participate in meetings. We are very happy that the first country we visited is our closest revolutionary comrade, Albania. This is another living proof of the unbreakable fighting friendship between the youth and the people of our two countries!"

Yao Wenyuan praised the Albanian people as a great people, the Albanian state as a great proletarian dictatorship, and the Albanian Party of Labor as a steadfast Marxist-Leninist party. He also praised Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people and a close friend of the Chinese people, as a great communist warrior. Under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor, the Albanian working class has adhered to the principle of self-reliance, made great contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and implemented the decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Party.

We, the Chinese Red Guards, express our warm congratulations on this!

During this visit to Albania, we deeply felt the revolutionary firmness and brave spirit shown by the Albanian people in their struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. Our great leader Chairman Mao said in his message to your Party's Fifth Congress: "The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, the Yugoslav Tito clique, and all kinds of traitor and scab cliques are nothing but a handful of dust compared to you, who are mountains towering into the sky." We want to learn from your revolutionary spirit.

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great and historic victories. Our Chinese working class adheres to the policy of "revolutionizing and promoting production" and has launched a new high tide in socialist construction. On June 17, our country successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The detonation of the hydrogen bomb is a crushing blow to the various rumors spread by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to slander and attack the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

The Chinese working class and the Albanian working class and laboring people have forged a deep class friendship. When the January Revolution storm arose in Shanghai, when the revolutionary working class of Shanghai and various revolutionary organizations, holding high the banner of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, stood up to smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist and economistic black wind stirred up by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and took the destiny of proletarian dictatorship, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and socialist economy firmly into their own hands, it was the Albanian working class that, among all the people in the world, first sent many enthusiastic letters expressing warm support for the revolutionary actions of the Chinese working class and the revolutionary leftists, supporting our revolutionary struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders. We will never forget that during our stormy days of struggle, the Albanian working class was fighting alongside us!

Our Red Guards delegation brings the deep class feelings of all Red Guards in China to the revolutionary youth and all laboring people of Albania. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. Chairman Mao is our red commander. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our thoughts and actions. Our battle cry is: study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao most supports us Red Guards and the revolutionary leftists. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts. We, the Chinese Red Guards, will resolutely fight for the complete victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and resolutely fight to consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our struggle has been directed against imperialism, revisionism, the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and their running dogs, against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and against the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. We have exposed, thoroughly criticized, and overthrown the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists engaged in capitalist restoration and the handful of capitalist-roaders to prevent capitalist restoration, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and strengthen and consolidate the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. We, the Chinese Red Guards, are determined to fight under the command of our supreme commander, Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to the end!

Bruci, in his speech, said that when we heard the news that the Chinese Red Guards delegation was coming to our factory, we were very happy because there is an extremely close friendship between our two countries, a revolutionary and fighting friendship based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This friendship has been tested and tempered in storms and tempests.

He said that the Albanian Party of Labor, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the Albanian Union of Labor Youth firmly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary line has achieved great historical victories. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will ultimately and thoroughly solve the problem of preventing capitalist restoration and is strengthening proletarian dictatorship.

Bruci warmly praised the great victory of China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb.

He also said that the People's Republic of China has made very valuable contributions to the socialist construction of our country. This factory was established with the fraternal and internationalist aid of China.

Bruci asked the Chinese Red Guards delegation to convey the most enthusiastic revolutionary greetings of the Albanian youth to the Chinese youth. He said that no matter when, no matter what happens, our youth will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese youth to fight against imperialism and modern revisionism.

The speeches of Comrade Yao Wenyuan and Comrade Bruci were repeatedly interrupted by slogans such as "Enver-Mao" and "Friendship is the guarantee" and by extremely enthusiastic applause.

Comrade Bruci, on behalf of the factory's Labor Youth League organization, presented a banner to the Chinese Red Guards delegation, which read: "Presented to the Chinese Red Guards delegation." Comrade Yao Wenyuan, on behalf of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, presented a woven portrait of Chairman Mao and a woven portrait of Comrade Enver Hoxha to the workers of the factory. The entire venue erupted in enthusiastic applause, shouting: "Enver-Mao."

Then, Comrade Tan Houlan of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, on behalf of the Chinese Red Guards, presented Red Guards armbands to the factory director, Comrade Piristri, and the Vice Secretary of the Labor Youth League factory committee, Comrade Bruci, and other comrades. When Comrade Tan Houlan helped Comrade Piristri put on the bright red armband, Comrade Piristri, extremely moved, walked to the front of the stage and announced to the crowd: "Comrades, I am wearing the Chinese Red Guards armband on behalf of you all. I pledge to always be loyal to this armband and never to tarnish it." He raised his fist and shouted: "Long live the Red Guards!" At this moment, the entire venue was in a frenzy, shouting "Enver-Mao," and the stormy slogans echoed endlessly.

When the delegation left the factory, many workers warmly embraced and shook hands with the delegation members, bidding them a reluctant farewell.

The Chinese Red Guards delegation also visited the memorial halls of the founding of the Albanian Party of Labor, the National Liberation Struggle Museum, and the memorial hall of the founding of the Albanian Union of Labor Youth on the same day, and presented gifts such as woven portraits of Chairman Mao and paintings of the Zunyi Conference to these halls.

The Chinese Red Guards wrote in the guest book at the memorial hall of the founding of the Albanian Party of Labor: "Salute to the glorious Albanian Party of Labor! Salute to the great communist warrior Comrade Enver Hoxha! 'A single spark can start a prairie fire.' 'Long live the victory of communism throughout the world!' Comrade Yao Wenyuan also presented a woven portrait of Chairman Mao wearing the Red Guards armband for the first time to the guide of the hall. The guide enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the Red Guards!"

Wherever the Chinese Red Guards delegation went, whether adults or children, they all expressed the warmest welcome to the little red soldiers sent by Chairman Mao.

    中国红卫兵向阿尔巴尼亚革命战友致敬
    地拉那各界热烈欢迎我红卫兵代表团，高呼“红卫兵万岁！”
    姚文元同志在欢迎大会上感谢阿人民对我文化大革命的热情支持
    据新华社地拉那二十四日电  由姚文元同志率领的中国红卫兵代表团二十二日在阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第一书记梅罗等领导人陪同下，参观了地拉那拖拉机配件厂和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立纪念馆、阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟成立纪念馆等，受到了阿尔巴尼亚广大群众极其热烈的欢迎。
    当天，陪同中国红卫兵代表团参观访问的还有中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使刘晓。
    中国红卫兵代表团在地拉那拖拉机配件厂受到了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员、地拉那拖拉机配件厂厂长皮里斯特里和广大工人的热烈欢迎。这个工厂的工人在中国红卫兵代表团参观了工厂以后，举行了热烈隆重的群众欢迎大会。大会会场上高悬中阿两国人民伟大的领袖毛主席和霍查同志的巨幅画像。阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟地拉那拖拉机配件厂委员会副书记布鲁齐和中国红卫兵代表团团长姚文元同志先后在大会上讲话。
    姚文元首先代表中国红卫兵代表团向全厂职工致以红卫兵的无产阶级的革命敬礼。他说，中国红卫兵派出自己的代表出国参加会议，这还是第一次。我们非常高兴的是，我们第一个访问的国家，就是我们最亲密的革命战友阿尔巴尼亚，这是我们两国青年、两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊的又一个活生生的证明！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是伟大的人民。阿尔巴尼亚国家是伟大的无产阶级专政的国家。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是久经考验的坚强的马克思列宁主义的党。阿尔巴尼亚人民的敬爱领袖、中国人民的亲密朋友恩维尔·霍查同志是伟大的共产主义战士。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级坚持自力更生的方针，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在贯彻劳动党“五大”的决议中，作出了巨大贡献。
    我们中国红卫兵对此表示热烈的祝贺！
    我们这次来到阿尔巴尼亚，深深感到阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对帝国主义、反对修正主义、反对各国反动派的斗争中所表现的革命坚定性和勇敢精神。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在给你们党“五大”的贺信中说：“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”我们要向你们这种革命精神学习。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命已经获得了伟大的有历史意义的胜利。我们中国工人阶级坚持“抓革命，促生产”的方针，在社会主义建设中掀起了新的高潮。六月十七日，我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命结出的又一辉煌成果。美帝国主义和苏联修正主义造出各种谣言诬蔑和攻击中国文化大革命，这次氢弹爆炸，对于他们的种种谣言，是一个粉碎性的打击。
    我们中国工人阶级与阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和劳动人民，结下了极其深厚的阶级友谊。当一月革命风暴在上海兴起的时候，当上海革命的工人阶级同各个革命组织，高举毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大旗，挺身而出，粉碎由党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派刮起的反革命修正主义的经济主义黑风，把无产阶级专政的命运、无产阶级文化大革命的命运、社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己手中的时候，在世界上，首先是阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级，寄来了许多热情洋溢的信，热情支持中国革命的工人阶级和无产阶级革命派的革命行动，支持了我们从一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权的革命斗争。我们永远不会忘记，在我们急风暴雨般的斗争日子里，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级是和我们共同战斗的！
    我们红卫兵代表团，带来了中国全体红卫兵战士对阿尔巴尼亚革命青年和全体劳动人民的深厚的阶级感情。我们是毛主席的红小兵。毛主席是我们的红司令。毛泽东思想是我们一切思想和行动的指针。我们的战斗口号是：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。毛主席最支持我们红卫兵和无产阶级革命派，毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。我们中国红卫兵，坚决为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的彻底胜利而战斗，坚决为巩固无产阶级专政而战斗。从无产阶级文化大革命一开始，我们斗争的矛头就紧紧对准帝国主义、修正主义、地主阶级、资产阶级和他们的走狗，紧紧对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，紧紧对准那些剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。我们把极少数进行资本主义复辟勾当的反革命修正主义分子，一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭发出来，彻底批判和打倒，正是为了防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政、巩固和加强以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导。我们中国红卫兵决心在我们的最高统帅毛主席的率领下，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把中国无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    布鲁齐发表讲话说，当我们知道中国红卫兵代表团要到我们工厂来的消息时，非常高兴，因为在我们两国之间有着极其紧密的友谊，革命的和战斗的友谊，建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的友谊。这一友谊在狂风暴雨中经受了考验和锻炼。
    他说，以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟坚决支持由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。在毛主席正确领导下的革命路线已经取得了伟大的历史性胜利。无产阶级文化大革命最后彻底解决了防止资本主义复辟的问题，同时正在加强无产阶级专政。
    布鲁齐热情赞扬了中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的伟大胜利。
    他还说，中华人民共和国为我国的社会主义建设作出了十分宝贵的贡献。我们这个工厂就是由中国的兄弟般的和国际主义的援助建立起来的。
    布鲁齐请中国红卫兵代表团向中国青年转达阿尔巴尼亚青年最热烈的革命敬礼。他说，不管在什么时候，不管出现什么情况，我国青年将同中国青年并肩在一起，为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义而战斗。
    姚文元同志和布鲁齐同志的讲话不断为“恩维尔—毛泽东”“友谊就是保证”等口号声和极其热烈的掌声所打断。
    布鲁齐同志代表该厂劳动青年联盟组织送给中国红卫兵代表团一面锦旗，上面写着：“赠给中国红卫兵代表团”。姚文元同志代表中国红卫兵代表团把一幅织锦的毛主席像和一幅织锦的霍查同志像送给厂里工人。全场响起了热烈的掌声，高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东”。
    接着，中国红卫兵代表团团员谭厚兰同志代表中国红卫兵向该厂厂长皮里斯特里和劳动青年联盟厂委员会副书记布鲁齐等同志赠送中国红卫兵袖章。当谭厚兰同志替皮里斯特里同志戴上红彤彤的袖章时，皮里斯特里同志异常激动地走到主席台前向群众宣布：“同志们，我代表你们戴上了中国红卫兵袖章，我保证将永远忠于这一袖章，永远不玷污这一袖章。”他振臂高呼：“红卫兵万岁！”这时全场欢腾，高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”，暴风雨般的口号声经久不息。
    代表团在离开该厂时，许多工人同代表团的团员们热烈拥抱握手，依依惜别。
    中国红卫兵代表团当天还参观了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立纪念馆，民族解放斗争博物馆和阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟成立纪念馆，并向这些馆赠送了毛主席织锦像、遵义会议会址画幅等礼品。
    中国红卫兵在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立纪念馆的留言簿上题词：“向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党致敬！向伟大的共产主义战士恩维尔·霍查同志致敬！”“星星之火，可以燎原。”“共产主义在全世界的胜利万岁！”姚文元同志并把一幅毛主席第一次戴上红卫兵袖章的织锦画像送给该馆讲解员。这位讲解员热情高呼：“红卫兵万岁！”
    中国红卫兵代表团所到之处，无论是成人或儿童都对毛主席派来的红小兵表示最热烈的欢迎。
