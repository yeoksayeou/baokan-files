On May 22, the Hong Kong British authorities unjustly arrested our patriotic compatriots from Hong Kong and Kowloon. To resist the persecution by British imperialism and defend the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, they waged an inspiring and heroic struggle. In their fight against the brutal Hong Kong police and thugs, under the enemy's beatings and torture, they remained unyielding and dignified, setting a shining example for all the people of China. We extend our warm greetings and pay our highest respects to our compatriots who remain steadfast in the enemy's prisons!

The brave patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon are truly the good sons and daughters of our motherland. The Chinese people have never bowed down to the imperialist bandits and have always bravely fought against imperialism. From the Opium War onwards, the struggle between the Chinese people and British imperialism has never ceased. The great strike by the workers of Guangdong and Hong Kong was a magnificent epic of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in their anti-imperialist struggle. Today, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong are carrying on this glorious revolutionary tradition and continuing to write this great chapter of the Chinese nation's anti-imperialist struggle.

The brave patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon are truly loyal soldiers of the great leader Chairman Mao and of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The evil British imperialists, in order to block the influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, have adopted extremely savage fascist methods to persecute our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Hong Kong British police and special agents even used torture in prison to threaten our patriotic compatriots, forcing them to remove the Chairman Mao badges from their chests. But our compatriots vowed to defend the Chairman Mao badges to the death. They answered firmly: "Even if you beat us to death, we will not remove it!" The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong prisons are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought. They would rather die than give up Mao Zedong Thought. This is the great vow of the brave patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, and they are putting this solemn vow into practice in the face of the enemy's bayonets and bullets.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the inexhaustible source of the fighting spirit and strength of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. With Mao Zedong Thought, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong are invincible. With Mao Zedong Thought, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong become invincibly strong. Although British imperialism relies on military police, special agents, guns, bayonets, and fascist decrees, and even deploys aircraft carriers, all these things are just small tricks. British imperialism itself is just a paper tiger. It will surely be smashed by the great revolutionary storm of the Hong Kong compatriots!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will always make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The more British imperialism crazily suppresses our Hong Kong compatriots, the closer its doom in Hong Kong will be. With the support of 700 million people of our motherland, our Hong Kong patriotic compatriots will surely demand blood debt from British imperialism and will surely sentence British imperialism to death! This historic day will surely come!

    向英勇的港九爱国同胞致敬
    本报评论员
    五月二十二日被港英当局无理逮捕的我港九爱国同胞，为了反抗英帝国主义的迫害，保卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想，进行了可歌可泣的英勇斗争。他们在同残暴的香港警察和暴徒的搏斗中，在敌人的毒打和酷刑之下，威武不屈，大义凛然，为全中国人民树立了一个光辉的榜样。我们向在敌人监狱中坚贞不屈的港九爱国同胞们，致以亲切的慰问和崇高的战斗的敬礼！
    英勇的港九爱国同胞们不愧为祖国的好儿女。中国人民从来都不曾在帝国主义强盗面前卑躬屈膝，从来都前赴后继地向着帝国主义展开英勇不屈的斗争。从鸦片战争开始，中国人民同英帝国主义的斗争，一直没有停止过。当年的省港工人的大罢工，就是中国工人阶级和中国人民写下的一首反帝斗争的壮丽的史诗。今天，香港爱国同胞，继承了这个光荣的革命传统，正在续写这部中华民族反帝斗争的伟大诗篇。
    英勇的港九爱国同胞们不愧为忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想的好战士。万恶的英帝国主义为了阻挡我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响和毛泽东思想的传播，采取了极其野蛮的法西斯手段，对我港九爱国同胞进行迫害。港英警察特务甚至在监狱中用酷刑威胁我爱国同胞，强迫他们从胸前除下毛主席像章。但是，我们的同胞誓死保卫毛主席像章，他们斩钉截铁地回答：“打死都不除！”在狱中的香港爱国同胞，无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。这是英勇的香港爱国同胞的伟大的誓言，他们在敌人的刺刀和枪弹面前，正在实践这个庄严的誓言。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是香港爱国同胞的斗争勇气和力量的取之不竭的源泉。有了毛泽东思想，香港爱国同胞就无往而不胜。有了毛泽东思想，香港爱国同胞就变得无比强大。尽管英帝国主义依靠军警特务、枪炮、刺刀，依靠法西斯法令，甚至出动航空母舰，但是所有这些东西都不过是些小小的玩艺儿，英帝国主义本身也不过是一只纸老虎。它必将被香港同胞的伟大革命风暴所粉碎！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。英帝国主义越是疯狂镇压我香港同胞，它在香港的末日也就越是临近。我香港爱国同胞在七亿祖国人民的支持下，一定要向英帝国主义索还血债，一定要判处英帝国主义的死刑！这个历史性的日子，是一定要到来的。
