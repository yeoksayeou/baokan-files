	Editor's Note: The three letters from readers published here offer some specific suggestions on how to save and make revolution. They are all good and deserve the attention of comrades in revolutionary organizations. Chairman Mao has instructed us to "save and make revolution." This is a far-reaching and great call. All revolutionary organizations must seriously and concretely turn this great call into specific actions, take measures, and achieve results. Those who are wasteful, extravagant, and indifferent, who consider saving a penny or a grain of rice as a trivial matter, are not displaying the spirit of the proletariat. Starting from small matters like canceling broadcast cars, stopping the giving of gifts, and using mud paste instead of glue, we must adhere to Chairman Mao's teaching of "saving every copper coin" in every matter, and persist in doing so. The result will not only avoid a large amount of material waste but also cultivate a new spirit of thrift and hard work.

	Cancel Broadcast Cars and Loudspeakers

	Currently, many units and mass organizations have installed broadcast cars and loudspeakers to carry out propaganda activities. We did some calculations: installing one broadcast car generally requires six loudspeakers, one microphone, one amplifier, and one generator, totaling about 2,500 yuan. Broadcast cars have a low speed and consume a lot of gasoline, generally requiring 1.5 gallons of gasoline for every hour of operation. Cars and gasoline are indispensable for industrial and agricultural production and transportation. If cars are occupied and gasoline is wasted, it will directly affect industrial and agricultural production and transportation.

	Previously, the first, second, and third floors of our department store all had several sets of loudspeakers. The two factions broadcasted against each other, making it difficult for customers and salespeople to hear each other, affecting business.

	In our vicinity, there was a time when several sets of loudspeakers broadcasted day and night, and broadcast cars came and went on the streets, making it impossible for nearby factories, shops, and offices to work normally, and the people could not get good rest. As for some organizations using broadcast cars and loudspeakers to attack each other, this not only affects production but also intensifies the opposition between the two factions.

	Now, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has decided to stop using broadcast cars and loudspeakers, and we firmly support this measure.

	We suggest that the proletarian revolutionary factions in various places take active action to cancel broadcast cars and loudspeakers and save and make revolution.

专栏：革命群众来信

    编者按：这里发表的三封读者来信，提出了节约闹革命的一些具体建议，都很好。值得引起革命组织的同志们注意。毛主席指示我们“要节约闹革命”。这是一个意义深远的伟大号召，一切革命组织，都要严肃地切实地把这个伟大号召变为具体的行动，采取措施，取得效果。那种大手大脚，铺张浪费，满不在乎，把节约一分钱、一斤粮看成无足轻重的“小事”，绝不是无产阶级的作风。从取消广播车，停止送礼，用黄泥浆代替浆糊这类“小事”做起，在每一件事情上都贯彻毛主席教导的“节省每一个铜板”的精神，并且坚持下去，其结果，不仅可以避免物质方面的大量浪费，而且可以培养起勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的一代新风。
    取消广播车和高音喇叭
    现在，许多单位和群众组织都安装了广播车和高音喇叭，开展宣传活动。我们算了一下账：安装一辆广播车，一般需要六个喇叭、一个话筒、一个扩大器、一部发电机，共计要花费两千五百来元。广播车行驶速度低，耗费汽油多，一般一辆广播车每行驶一小时就需要一点五加仑汽油。汽车和汽油都是工农业生产和交通运输方面不可缺少的。占用了汽车，浪费了汽油，就要直接影响工农业生产和交通运输。
    前一个时候，我们百货大楼一二三楼都安了好几套喇叭，两派相互对着广播，吵得顾客和售货员之间说话都听不清，影响营业。
    在我们附近一带，有一段时间也有好几套高音喇叭日夜不停地广播，加上广播车在马路上过来过去，吵得附近工厂、商店、机关无法进行正常工作，群众得不到很好的休息。至于个别的组织之间，利用广播车和高音喇叭互相攻击，那就不仅影响了生产，还加剧了两派群众之间的对立。
    现在，北京市革命委员会已经决定停止使用广播车和高音喇叭，我们坚决拥护这个措施。
    我们建议各地的无产阶级革命派积极行动起来，取消广播车和高音喇叭，都来节约闹革命。
