The focus of class struggle before the proletariat seizes power is the question of power; under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the focus of class struggle remains the question of power.

From our personal experiences, we deeply understand the importance of power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. In the old society, my family, generation after generation, were like oxen and horses for the landlords, living in bitter water year after year. The "three mountains" pressed down on us poor people so that we couldn't breathe. In May 1942, during the Japanese devils' "mop-up" campaign, our entire village of over 300 households was ravaged, and my father, uncle, and 380 other innocent people were brutally killed. At that time, where was there a place for the poor to speak? Where was there a way out for the poor? This was because the proletariat did not hold power. Our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, taught us that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Only by shouldering the gun, smashing the old world, and seizing power in the hands of the proletariat, can the laboring people have everything. In October 1945, I joined the people's army and followed Chairman Mao to make revolution. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of our country, after a long and arduous struggle, finally used the gun to fight for a red, proletarian dictatorship of a new China. From then on, the laboring people became masters of the country.

However, the proletariat seizing power is only the first step of the long march. The struggle between the proletariat to consolidate power and the bourgeoisie to usurp power will continue throughout the entire socialist period. The class enemies will not voluntarily retire from the historical stage. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and sabotage in various ways. They will try every day and every moment to restore capitalism in China." The history of class struggle in the 17 years since liberation fully proves this great truth. Just as our great new China was born, the domestic and foreign class enemies launched a ferocious attack on us. In 1950, American imperialism launched the crazy war of aggression against Korea, and the domestic class enemies also began to stir. They attempted to collude internally and externally to strangle our proletarian dictatorship state in its cradle. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, rushed to the Korean battlefield and fought side by side with the Korean people. After three years of war, we finally defeated American imperialism. At Panmunjom, I personally saw the American war criminals sign the document on the negotiating table. The facts of the past decade have proven that class struggle is extremely sharp. The class enemies have repeatedly attacked us, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. However, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, their attacks have been smashed by us time and time again, and we have achieved great victories, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a great revolution that touches people's souls and a great innovation in the international communist movement. From this shocking class struggle, we have seen more clearly the long-term, complex, and sharp nature of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the most dangerous enemy who has burrowed into our hearts. He has long been waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, opposing the proletarian dictatorship and attempting to restore capitalism. It is this Chinese Khrushchev who, in the early days of national liberation, shouted that "capitalism is not too much but too little" and sang the reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "rebellion is a crime," vigorously developing capitalism. After our socialist transformation was basically completed, he vigorously promoted the theory of "extinction of class struggle." In 1962, when domestic and international class struggles were extremely sharp, he desperately advocated "three harmonies and one less," "three autonomies and one contract," and once again threw out the poisonous weed of "Cultivation," refusing to talk about the real class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is to make people forget about class struggle in socialist society and forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that they can engage in "self-cultivation" to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The wolf's heart is so poisonous!

Today, this Chinese Khrushchev and his gang have been exposed by us revolutionary people. This is the brilliant victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Our Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's army created by the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and directly led by Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin. It is the most important tool and strongest pillar of the proletarian dictatorship and the mainstay of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Without the people's army, there would be no proletarian dictatorship. In the past, we fought south and north, using the gun to seize the people's mountains; today, we will use the gun to defend the Cultural Revolution and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things go wrong, the restoration of capitalism is possible at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be very careful, never relax vigilance. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great battle to lead hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to launch a general offensive against the most dangerous enemies of the proletarian dictatorship. In the future, we will fight such great battles. Only in this way can we continually uproot the time bombs buried in our Party and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship.

We revolutionary soldiers enthusiastically and resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the Party, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp the revolutionary gun, and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade; take up the revolutionary pen, and thoroughly criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defend the proletarian dictatorship to the death, and ensure that our country remains red forever.

    抓住阶级斗争的焦点
    解放军某部特等功臣、战斗英雄　黄丑和
    在无产阶级没有夺取政权以前，阶级斗争的焦点是政权问题；在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。
    我们从亲身经历中深深地体会到政权的重要。有了政权，就有了一切；失了政权，就失了一切。在旧社会，我家祖祖辈辈给地主当牛马，成年累月在苦水里过日子。“三座大山”压得我们穷人喘不过气来。在一九四二年五月一日，日本鬼子进行大“扫荡”时，我们全村三百多户人家遭到摧残，我的父亲、叔父和三百八十多个无辜的人民惨遭杀害。那时候，哪有穷人说话的地方？哪有穷人的活路？这就是因为无产阶级没有掌握政权。我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，给我们穷人指出了光明大道。只有扛起枪杆子，砸碎旧世界，把权掌握在无产阶级手里，才有劳动人民的一切。一九四五年十月，我参加了人民的军队，跟随毛主席闹革命。我国革命人民在毛主席的英明领导下，经过了长期的艰苦奋斗，终于用枪杆子打出了一个红彤彤的无产阶级专政的新中国。从此，劳动人民才当家作了主人。
    但是，无产阶级夺取了政权，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。无产阶级巩固政权同资产阶级篡夺政权的斗争，仍将贯穿在整个社会主义时期。阶级敌人是不会自行退出历史舞台的。毛主席指出：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”解放后十七年来的阶级斗争历史，充分地证明了这个伟大的真理。正当我们伟大的新中国刚刚诞生的时候，国内外的阶级敌人就向我们猖狂地进攻。一九五○年，美帝国主义疯狂地发动了侵朝战争，国内阶级敌人也蠢蠢欲动，他们妄图里应外合，把我们的无产阶级专政的国家掐死在摇篮里。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民志愿军，奔赴朝鲜战场，同朝鲜人民并肩战斗，经过三年战争，终于打败了美帝国主义。在板门店，我亲眼看到美国战争贩子乖乖地在谈判桌上签了字。十多年来的事实证明，阶级斗争是十分尖锐的。阶级敌人不断地向我们进攻，妄图推翻无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。但是由于毛主席的英明领导，他们的进攻都被我们一次又一次地粉碎了，我们取得了伟大的胜利，巩固了无产阶级专政。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。从这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争的事实中，我们更加看清了阶级斗争在无产阶级专政条件下的长期性、复杂性和尖锐性。正如毛主席所指出的：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是钻进我们肝脏里的最危险的敌人。他长期打着“红旗”反红旗，反对无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义。就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在全国解放初期，叫嚷“资本主义不是太多了，而是太少了”，高唱“剥削有功”、“造反有罪”的反动谬论，极力发展资本主义。在我国社会主义改造基本完成后，他大肆宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论。一九六二年，正当国内外阶级斗争极其尖锐的时候，他拚命地鼓吹“三和一少”，“三自一包”，再次抛出《修养》这株大毒草，闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政。这就是要人们忘掉社会主义社会的阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，去进行“自我修养”，以便他变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。狼子野心，何其毒也！
    今天，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙被我们革命人民揪出来了，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    我们中国人民解放军是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造，林副统帅直接领导的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的最主要的工具和最强大的柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。没有人民的军队，便没有无产阶级专政。过去，我们南征北战，用枪杆子打下了人民的江山；今天，我们要用枪杆子来保卫文化大革命，巩固无产阶级专政。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是率领亿万革命人民向无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人发动总攻击的大战役。今后，我们还要打这样的大战役。只有这样，才能不断地挖掉埋在我们党内的定时炸弹，巩固无产阶级专政。
    我们革命战士最热烈、最坚决地响应党中央的号召，永远忠于毛主席、忠于党、忠于毛主席的革命路线。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，握紧革命的枪杆子，随时准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人；拿起革命的笔杆子，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批透、批臭。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政，保证我们的国家千秋万代永不变色。
