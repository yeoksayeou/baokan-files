For seventeen years since the founding of the nation, counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, and Qi Yan Ming, with the support of China's Khrushchev, have been spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda, attempting to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has seen through the various plots of China's Khrushchev and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. In September 1962, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention. Anyone who wants to overthrow a regime must first create public opinion and do ideological work. Revolutionary classes are like this, and counter-revolutionary classes are also like this." In December 1963 and June 1964, Chairman Mao made two more brilliant directives against the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line's control over the literary and artistic circles. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, and launched a mass criticism of Yang Xianzhen's "unification of two into one" theory, Zhou Gucheng's "merging of the spirit of the times" theory, and the reactionary films "Northern Jiangnan" and "Early Spring in February," among others. Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and their gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists, along with China's Khrushchev behind them, were terrified of this revolutionary criticism. They used various tricks and desperately resisted, doing everything in their power to extinguish the flames of this revolutionary criticism. In February 1965, with the support of China's Khrushchev, Zhou Yang and others convened a meeting of the heads of major newspapers and magazines, where they cursed the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for criticizing poisonous weeds as "sea warfare tactics," "one-sided," and "having little logic." They attacked the critical articles in the newspapers and magazines as "fabricating charges," "just putting labels," "dogmatism," "shooting blanks," and "one-sidedness and absolutism." Then, the two biggest capital roaders in the party came out, accusing the criticism movement of being "overdone" and "hindering the prosperity of creation." They shamelessly cursed those who raised the banner of revolutionary criticism as "gaining fame by criticizing others and stepping on others' shoulders to rise to power." Thus, they shouted loudly: "We must brake immediately!" With the support of China's Khrushchev, this gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists staged a big deception of criticizing in public but protecting in secret. From February to August 1965, the fake criticism of the reactionary films "Lin's Shop" and "City That Never Sleeps" was an important aspect of this political deception.

In August 1964, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in a report on the criticism of "Northern Jiangnan" and "Early Spring in February": "There may not be just these two films; there may be others that also need to be criticized." In December of the same year, Comrade Jiang Qing, based on Chairman Mao's instructions, asked Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and others to expose ten poisonous films, including "City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop." Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and others stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions, suppressing Jiang Qing's proposed criticism plan on one hand, and secretly arranging countermeasures on the other. It was not until February and March 1965 that they proposed to criticize "Lin's Shop" and "City That Never Sleeps." Then, they carried out a series of evil activities according to the plan of fake criticism.

	Setting boundaries, setting the tone, changing the direction of the struggle

In January 1964, China's Khrushchev convened a meeting with Peng Zhen, Zhou Yang, and others to oppose Chairman Mao's directives, holding a so-called "literary and artistic symposium." At the meeting, they sang in unison, openly describing the rampant ghosts and snakes in the literary and artistic circles as "mostly problems of understanding." Following the tone set by China's Khrushchev at this meeting, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others rushed around, frantically sabotaging the great criticism movement initiated by Chairman Mao himself.

When the criticism of "City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" had just begun, in March 1965, Peng Zhen convened a meeting with Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others at his home to give a black directive on the criticism of the films "Lin's Shop" and "City That Never Sleeps." He emphasized that the problems of these two films were problems of understanding, protecting Xia Yan to pass. He said: "This criticism is of an academic discussion nature, and we should focus on reasoning and not make people feel that they cannot speak or make mistakes. This criticism should be of high quality! Few but precise, one or two summary articles in party newspapers and party journals will do." He also said: "The original work of 'Lin's Shop' had positive significance at that time. The bourgeoisie has a side that is oppressed by the 'three great enemies,' and this can be sympathized with." He completely avoided the key issues of the films but required focusing on criticizing the so-called "big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp" problem; he set boundaries and rules, doing everything possible to suppress workers, peasants, and soldiers from participating in the criticism. Based on Peng Zhen's black directive, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others used their authority to issue "directives" and "unify the line." They did not mention political issues but made studying "how literary works should depict the bourgeoisie" the highest goal of criticizing these two reactionary films. They said this was a "new topic" and "new task" in literary creation, a "frontier," doing everything possible to lead the criticism into the wrong path of so-called "pure academic" discussion. In April 1965, when discussing the problem of criticizing Xia Yan's "Film Essays," Zhou Yang even more nakedly said: "Only discuss academics, not politics."

Is the criticism of "City That Never Sleeps" and "Lin's Shop" really an academic debate? Are the serious crimes of Xia Yan and others really just "problems of understanding"? Absolutely not! This is a big deception staged by China's Khrushchev behind the scenes, a big counter-revolutionary political plot.

The reactionary films "Lin's Shop" and "City That Never Sleeps" are two big poisonous weeds of anti-party and anti-socialism. The creators of the films spared no effort to plead for and sing the praises of the capitalists, inciting them to counterattack and overturn proletarian dictatorship; the films fervently advocated the reactionary theory of "peaceful transition to socialism," opposing socialist revolution and proletarian dictatorship. The films extensively propagated China's Khrushchev's philosophy of surrender, corrupting the revolutionary ranks. Tell me, is making such big poisonous weeds an "academic problem"? Is it just a "problem of understanding"? Initially, Xia Yan and others were so proud and self-revealing, repeatedly admitting that they wrote the films for the "good of the reform of industry and commerce," for "politics," for "reality." Yet now, you want to lightly describe how to "understand" this and how to "express" that to cover up the past. Isn't this too much for your partner Xia Yan?

It is quite obvious that Zhou Yang and others did this precisely to blur the nature of this criticism, shift the direction of the struggle, and push the political and key issues of the two films and their backstage planners aside, trying to pass through and deceivingly waiting for a day to pounce and achieve counter-revolutionary restoration.

	Setting traps, peddling reactionary goods

Chairman Mao teaches us: All class struggles are political struggles. Zhou Yang and others negate the political nature of this criticism, aiming to cancel proletarian politics and highlight bourgeois politics. Their series of activities around this fake criticism fully prove this point.

Zhou Yang and his gang racked their brains to come up with a bunch of so-called "pure academic" discussion issues, throwing them at the comrades participating in the criticism.

Lin Mo Han took the lead, asking at the outset: "Is Lin the boss a bourgeois or a petty bourgeois?" Zhou Yang then took the stage. He said one moment that Lin the boss was a "not very big capitalist," and another moment that Lin the boss was a "not big, not small capitalist." Thus, creating confusion. They also solemnly invited a few "economists" to hold an "academic discussion" meeting, determining Lin the boss's "class status." These "authorities" pretended to be serious, arguing nonsense, with no results.

As soon as the farce of "determining class status" ended, they took turns to appear, asking questions like "Does Lin the boss have a side that is exploited?" "How to understand the problem of 'big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp'?" "Can we sympathize with Lin the boss?" "Does Lin the boss selling Japanese goods count as a traitor?" "How much money can the widow Zhang make by selling water?" and so on. It was truly a mess, with nothing strange. Lu Dingyi was even more sinister, asking people to study how to express the party's "exhaustive kindness" to the bourgeoisie, nonsense about how "the problem of 'City That Never Sleeps' is not only that it does not express the struggle against the bourgeoisie but also that it does not express the unity with the bourgeoisie." Based on Lu Dingyi's black directive, someone shouted: "We cannot generally say that the reform of the bourgeoisie is forced; otherwise, how do we view the unity and education of the bourgeoisie?" They tried to use these messy questions to push some revolutionary young people participating in the criticism into the labyrinth of "pure academic" debate, tying their hands and feet.

Although Zhou Yang and his gang set up many traps, trying to sabotage this great criticism, many comrades participating in the criticism, through studying Chairman Mao's works and discussion, had an increasingly clear understanding of the political issues of the films. This time, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and their gang were in a panic. Thus, they threw away their disguises, bare-chested, and openly defended these two films.

A comrade pointed out: "'Lin's Shop' expressed the reactionary social ideal of making China take the capitalist road." Peng Zhen hurriedly waved his stick, not allowing the discussion of such issues; and took the opportunity to brazenly distort and attack Mao Zedong Thought, nonsense about how "the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution is to clear the way for the development of capitalism." Lu Dingyi, following this idea, maliciously added two sentences in Lin Mo Han's fake criticism article: "The victory of New Democracy not only opens the way for socialism but also opens the way for capitalism." Using this to advocate for the capitalist road. Later, they felt it was too brazen and reluctantly deleted it.

A comrade believed that Shou Sheng was a "slave of the capitalists, a traitor in the workers' ranks." Zhou Yang was very dissatisfied with this, angrily asking: "At that time, Lin the boss was oppressed by the 'three great enemies,' and Shou Sheng did not help Lin the boss. Should he help the 'three great enemies' instead?" In one sentence, he revealed the truth, originally, they themselves were the advocates of class surrenderism and traitor philosophy, and they and Shou Sheng were birds of a feather.

Tell me, can this be called "criticism"? No! This is fake criticism, true protection! This is a naked counter-revolutionary attack!

	Wielding big sticks, carrying out fierce suppression

In February 1965, as the criticism of the two poisonous films had just begun, in a speech on "some problems in literary criticism," Zhou Yang and his gang wielded sticks, proposing many prohibitions, directly pointing the spearhead at the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses. The first prohibition: "Do not arbitrarily label people"; the second prohibition: "Treat people equally"; the third prohibition: "Do not dig up old accounts"; the fourth prohibition: "Analyze poisonous weeds concretely, both complete affirmation and complete negation are one-sided"; the fifth prohibition: "Pay attention to the special nature of the literary and artistic circles, prevent literary people from looking down on each other." These rules and regulations are tight collars put on the workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses, and big sticks used by Zhou Yang and his gang to suppress the revolutionary criticism movement. Under these prohibitions, they did not allow workers, peasants, and soldiers to participate in the criticism, cursing the criticism of workers, peasants, and soldiers as "simplification." Whoever published a critical article by workers, peasants, and soldiers was accused of "tailism." Under these prohibitions, some groups writing critical articles spent months writing dozens of drafts, all of which were suppressed by them on the grounds of "simplification" and "lack of persuasiveness." Some articles that were written a bit sharply, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han angrily scolded these comrades as "standing above others and treating people with a commanding attitude."

This is outrageous! Should we not severely criticize poisonous weeds and ghosts and snakes, but instead "treat them equally" and let them spread freely? Should we not mercilessly strike against the counter-revolutionary revisionist restoration activities, but instead "treat them equally" and surrender to them? Inform these bourgeois lords, we cannot talk about equality with you, not at all. We did not talk about it in the past, we do not talk about it now, and we will never talk about it in the future.

Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others, along with China's Khrushchev behind them, when they long ruled the literary and artistic field with bourgeois dictatorship, they never said "treat people equally." They only allowed the bourgeois rightists to spread poison and did not allow the proletarian leftists to disinfect. When the proletariat wanted to implement dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the great criticism, they suddenly sang the high tune of "treating people equally," actually aiming to resist the proletariat's implementation of dictatorship in the cultural field. Once they dodge the storm of criticism, they will immediately put away the "equality" sign and carry out a hundred times more fierce counterattack and revenge!

	Playing tricks, avoiding key issues

Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Xia Yan and his gang are all poisonous melons on the same black vine. They are a gang of foxes and dogs under China's Khrushchev. To protect Xia Yan and others, they have exhausted their efforts and played all kinds of tricks. Lu Dingyi said in a report that he hoped Xia Yan could "write good works and have a good old age." Someone wrote an article criticizing the big poisonous weed "Jin Hua" (a standard of Zhou Yang's reactionary slogan "defense literature"), Zhou Yang and his gang jumped up in rage, saying that "'Jin Hua' cannot be criticized, otherwise, it will make Comrade Xia Yan stink!" In one sentence, they exposed Zhou Yang's secrets. Originally, they were most afraid of making Xia Yan and his gang "stink," but wanted to make him "smell good"! They are indeed a bunch of shameless people!

Precisely for this evil purpose, the old Propaganda Department's Yama Hall suppressed and killed a large number of articles criticizing "Lin's Shop," but sent Lin Mo Han to the Nan Yuan Hotel in Suzhou, exhausting his efforts to write an article titled "The Film 'Lin's Shop' is a Film that Glorifies the Bourgeoisie," staging a farce of "Zhou Yu fighting Huang Gai."

This article used all kinds of seemingly true but false words, deliberately avoiding the key issues of the film, and erasing the film's reactionary political purpose of shouting for the restoration of capitalism. It attributed Xia Yan's deliberate anti-party and anti-socialist evil activities to Xia Yan's "strange views" on the reform of the bourgeoisie, "thinking too naively," and affirmed Xia Yan as a "writer whose worldview has not been well reformed." The article also hinted to Xia Yan: "Hope you can benefit from this criticism." This is a genuine fake criticism, true protection poisonous weed.

From the fake criticism of "Lin's Shop," they drew a counter-revolutionary experience: it is still safer to do it yourself. Based on this "experience," after the fake criticism of "Lin's Shop," they again imitated the method, hiding in a high-level hotel in Dalian to plan the fake criticism of "City That Never Sleeps."

The "Promoting Class Reconciliationism Film 'City That Never Sleeps'" (signed by Yan Dongbin) also avoided the film's serious political problem of opposing proletarian dictatorship and advocating the restoration of capitalism, but elaborated on non-key issues, delighting in them. To defend the film's director, Lin Mo Han and others also played a trick of so-called subjective and objective contradictions, nonsense about how the film's director "may have the purpose" of "expressing our country's socialist reform of the national bourgeoisie" and "our party's glorious policy" when creating and shooting, the problem is just not "reflecting reality as it is." How casually said! Is it just a matter of the method of looking at problems? No! The film's fervent advocacy of "exploitation is reasonable," the hard work of propagating "peaceful transition to socialism," and the naked opposition to proletarian dictatorship are not accidental. Similarly, your avoidance of the film's key issues is also not accidental. In your own words, this is called "covering up for relatives."

It should also be pointed out that even such an article of fake criticism of Xia Yan, Zhou Yang was afraid of hurting their "Comrade Xia Yan." Before the article was published, he hurriedly sent it to Xia Yan to "seek his opinion." After reading it, Xia Yan pretended to find Zhou Yang and coquettishly said: "He read the article and even vomited," he really did not think the mistake was so serious. Then, he opened his mouth to give advice, saying: "Why are there places that do not call me a comrade?" "I not only want to face my mistakes but also want to correct my mistakes" and "I still want to write good works" and so on... Zhou Yang and others comforted Xia Yan in every possible way, and for his "demands," they all complied. In the original draft, after "hope Comrade Xia Yan... face the mistakes of the film 'Lin's Shop,'" Zhou Yang personally added two sentences: "... and correct mistakes in actual actions, creating more works beneficial to the people." (Zhou Yang felt the last sentence was too brazen and deleted it before publication.) Zhou Yang and others were very pleased with this and immediately summarized an "experience": "When criticizing someone, you can send the critical article to him to see, and if he has different opinions, he can also propose them, and we can revise it." And they made it a rule, ordering newspapers to follow this. What is this "experience"? This is to form an alliance of attack and defense, to collude and resist the masses' criticism, a counter-revolutionary trick!

	*****

Under the planning of Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and China's Khrushchev behind them, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary "academic authorities" were protected; countless critical articles by workers, peasants, and soldiers were strangled.

This infamous fake criticism is evidence of their desperate resistance in the face of the proletarian anti-restoration struggle and the prelude to Peng Zhen's counter-revolutionary "February Outline."

"Golden monkeys wield thousand-pound clubs, jade skies clear the dust for ten thousand miles." In this storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must expose this gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backstage supporters to the light of day, thoroughly criticize them, remove their positions, and seize their power to defend and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship.

    这笔老账必须彻底清算
    ——评关于反动影片《林家铺子》和《不夜城》的一场假批判
    谭俊　李丁
    建国十七年来，反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭等人，在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，大肆制造反革命舆论，妄图实现资本主义复辟。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席识破了中国的赫鲁晓夫以及他手下一小撮反革命修正主义分子的种种阴谋。一九六二年九月，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上指出：利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。一九六三年十二月和一九六四年六月，毛主席又针对反革命修正主义黑线对文艺界的统治，作了两个英明的批示。广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子，高举革命的批判旗帜，对杨献珍等人的“合二而一”论，周谷城等人的“时代精神汇合”论以及反动影片《北国江南》、《早春二月》等等，展开了群众性的大批判。彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵等一伙反革命修正主义分子，以及背后支持他们的中国的赫鲁晓夫，对这场革命的大批判怕得要死，他们施展种种阴谋诡计，拚死顽抗，竭尽全力，必欲扑灭这场革命批判的烈火而后快。一九六五年二月间，在中国的赫鲁晓夫支持下，周扬等人召集各主要报刊负责人开会时，大骂广大工农兵和革命群众对毒草的批判，是“文海战术”，“一面倒”，“没有多少道理”；攻击报刊上的批判文章，是“罗织罪状”，“光扣帽子”，“教条主义”，“打空炮”，“片面性和绝对化”。接着，两个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派双双出马，指责批判运动“过火了”，“妨碍了创作的繁荣”。他们无耻地咒骂高举革命批判旗帜的同志是“靠批判别人出名，踩着别人的肩膀自己上台。”于是，他们大喊大叫：要赶快“刹车”！在中国的赫鲁晓夫的背后支持下，这伙反革命修正主义分子一起出马，制造了一场明批暗保的大骗局。一九六五年二月到八月间，关于反动影片《林家铺子》和《不夜城》的假批判，就是这场政治大骗局的一个重要方面。
    一九六四年八月，毛主席在关于批判《北国江南》、《早春二月》的报告上明确指出：“可能不只这两部影片，还有别的，都需要批判。”同年十二月，江青同志根据毛主席的指示，要陆定一、周扬等把包括《不夜城》、《林家铺子》在内的十部毒草影片拿出来示众。陆定一、周扬等人顽固对抗毛主席的指示，一面扣压江青同志提出的批判计划，一面暗中安排对策，到一九六五年二、三月间，才提出要批判《林家铺子》和《不夜城》。接着，他们就按照假批判的计划，搞了一系列罪恶活动。
      划框框，定调子，转移斗争大方向
    一九六四年一月，中国的赫鲁晓夫召集彭真、周扬一伙，开了一个对抗毛主席批示的所谓“文艺座谈会”。在会上，他们一唱一和，公然把文艺界牛鬼蛇神的泛滥说成“绝大部分是认识问题”，按照中国赫鲁晓夫在这个会上定下的调子，周扬、林默涵等人四处奔走，疯狂地破坏毛主席亲自发动起来的这场大批判运动。
    当批判《不夜城》、《林家铺子》刚刚开始的时候，一九六五年三月，彭真召集周扬、林默涵等一伙，在他家里开了一次黑会，对电影《林家铺子》和《不夜城》的批判作了黑指示。他极力把这两部片子的问题说成是认识问题，包庇夏衍过关。他说：“这次批判是学术讨论性质，要以讲理为主，不要使人感到不能说话，不能犯错。这次批判，要高质量！少而精，党报、党刊写一、两篇总结文章就行了。”又说：“《林家铺子》的原著在当时是有积极意义的，资产阶级是有受三大敌人压迫的一面，这也是可以同情的。”他完全避开影片的要害问题，却要求集中去批判所谓“大鱼吃小鱼，小鱼吃虾米”的问题；他划框框，订条条，千方百计压制工农兵参加批判。根据彭真的这个黑指示，周扬、林默涵一伙利用职权，向全国发“指示”，“统一口径”。他们闭口不谈政治问题，而把研究“文艺作品应如何描写资产阶级”当作批判这两部反动影片的最高目的，并说这是文艺创作的“新课题”、“新任务”，是“尖端”，千方百计把批判引入所谓“纯学术”讨论的邪路。一九六五年四月，在一次谈到批判夏衍《电影论文集》的问题时，周扬更赤裸裸地说：“只谈学术，不谈政治。”
    难道说批判《不夜城》、《林家铺子》真的是一场学术论争吗？夏衍等人的严重罪行，真的只是
  “认识问题”吗？绝不是！这是由中国赫鲁晓夫幕后导演的一个瞒天过海的大骗局，是一个反革命政治大阴谋。
    反动影片《林家铺子》和《不夜城》是两棵反党反社会主义的大毒草。影片的炮制者尽心尽力地为资本家诉苦鸣冤、歌功颂德，煽动他们向无产阶级专政反攻倒算；影片狂热地鼓吹“和平长入社会主义”的反动理论，反对社会主义革命和无产阶级专政。影片大肆宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义哲学，腐蚀革命队伍。请问，你们炮制这样的大毒草，难道是什么“学术问题”吗？仅仅一个“认识问题”够用吗？想当初，夏衍等人那样得意忘形，一再不打自招地说，他们写影片是为了“对工商业的改造有好处”，是为了“政治”，为了“现实”；可是，现在你们却想轻描淡写地用如何“认识”这个，如何“表现”那个掩盖过去，这不是太委屈了你们的同伙夏衍了吗？
    十分明显，周扬等所以这样做，正是为了模糊这场批判的性质，转移斗争的方向，把两部影片及其幕后策划者的政治问题、要害问题，推卸得一干二净，以蒙混过关，妄图在将来的某一天，猛扑过来，实现反革命复辟。
          设圈套，贩卖反动货色
    毛主席教导我们：一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。周扬等人抹杀这场批判的政治性质，就是要取消无产阶级的政治，突出资产阶级的政治。他们围绕这场假批判搞的一系列活动，充分证实了这一点。
    周扬一伙挖空心思，提出了一大堆所谓“纯学术”讨论的问题，向参加批判的同志抛掷过来。
    林默涵一马当先，劈头就问：“林老板究竟是个资产阶级，还是个小资产阶级？”周扬接着出场。他一会儿说林老板是个“不大的资本家”，一会儿又说，林老板是个“不大不小的资本家”。以此制造混乱。他们还煞有介事地请来几个“经济学家”开了一个“学术讨论”会，给林老板“定成份”。这些“权威”们故作姿态，瞎吵一通，毫无结果。
    “定成份”的闹剧刚刚收场，他们又轮番出阵，什么“林老板这样的资本家有没有被剥削的一面”啦，什么“怎样理解‘大鱼吃小鱼，小鱼吃虾米’的问题”啦，什么“对林老板能不能同情”啦，什么“林老板卖日货算不算奸商”啦，什么“张寡妇卖水能赚多少钱”啦，诸如此类的问题，都提出来了，真是五花八门，无奇不有。陆定一更阴险，他要人们研究如何表现党对资产阶级的“仁至义尽”，胡说“《不夜城》的问题不仅是没有表现对资产阶级的斗争，更没有表现对资产阶级的团结。”根据陆定一的黑指示，有人叫嚷说：“不能笼、统说资产阶级改造是被迫的，否则，怎么看待对资产阶级的团结、教育？”他们企图用这些乌七八糟的问题，把参加批判的一些革命青年推进头绪纷繁的“纯学术”论争的迷宫，捆住他们的手脚。
    尽管周扬之流设下重重圈套，妄图破坏这场大批判，但是，参加批判的许多同志，经过学习毛主席著作，经过讨论，对影片的政治问题认识愈来愈清楚了。这一下，周扬、林默涵之流，又慌了手脚。于是，他们就抛掉伪装，赤膊上阵，公开为这两部影片辩护。
    有同志提出：“《林家铺子》表现了要使中国走资本主义道路的反动社会理想”。彭真急忙挥舞棍棒，不让涉及这类问题；并且借题发挥，露骨地篡改和攻击毛泽东思想，胡说什么“中国民主革命的胜利，就是为资本主义的发展扫清了道路。”陆定一按照这个意思，别有用心地在林默涵搞成的假批判文章上加了两句：“新民主主义的胜利，既给社会主义开辟了道路，也给资本主义开辟了道路。”借机鼓吹走资本主义道路。后来他们自己觉得太露骨了，才忍痛删去。
    有同志认为，寿生是“资本家的奴才，是工人队伍中的叛徒。”周扬对此大为不满，气势汹汹地责问说：“当时林老板受‘三大敌人’压迫，寿生不去帮助林老板，难道还让他去帮助‘三大敌人’？”一句话露了底细，原来他们自己就是阶级投降主义和叛徒哲学的鼓吹者，他们和寿生之流，是一丘之貉。
    请问，这能够叫“批判”吗？不！这是假批判、真包庇！这是赤裸裸的反革命进攻！
          抡大棒，进行疯狂镇压
    一九六五年二月，批判两部毒草影片刚刚开始，在一次所谓“文艺批判的一些问题”的讲话中，周扬之流挥舞棍棒，提出许多禁令，把矛头直接指向无产阶级革命派和革命群众。这个禁令一曰：“不准乱扣帽子”；二曰：“以平等态度对人”；三曰：“不许翻老账”；四曰：对毒草要“具体分析”，“全部肯定、否定都是片面性”；五曰：“注意文艺界的特殊性，防止文人相轻。”这些清规戒律，是套在工农兵和革命群众头上的紧箍咒，是周扬们镇压革命批判运动的反革命五条大棒。在这些禁令之下，他们不许工农兵参加批判，大骂工农兵的批判“简单化”，谁要发表工农兵的批判文章，就是“尾巴主义”。在这些禁令之下，有的写批判文章的小组，历时数月，先后写了四十多稿，都被他们借口“简单化”、“没有说服力”打入冷宫，有的文章写得稍尖锐一点，周扬、林默涵就怒气冲冲地责骂这些同志是“凌驾于别人之上，以训斥态度待人。”
    真是岂有此理！难道我们对毒草，对牛鬼蛇神，不应该严加批判，反倒要“以平等的态度”放任它们自由泛滥吗？难道对反革命修正主义的复辟活动，我们不应该无情打击，反倒要“以平等的态度”向它们举手投降吗？奉告这些资产阶级老爷们，对你们，我们就是不能讲平等，一点儿也不能讲。过去不讲，现在不讲，以后也永远不讲。
    彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵等人，以及背后支持他们的中国的赫鲁晓夫，当他们长期在文艺领域实行资产阶级专政的时候，他们从来也不说“以平等的态度待人”，他们只许资产阶级右派放毒，不准无产阶级左派消毒。当无产阶级要在大批判中对资产阶级实行专政时，他们忽然唱起了“平等待人”的高调，实际上正是要抵制无产阶级在文化领域实行专政。一待躲过批判的风暴，他们就会重新收起“平等”的招牌，对无产阶级进行疯狂百倍的反攻倒算！
          耍花招，回避要害问题
    陆定一、周扬、林默涵同夏衍之流，都是一条黑藤上的毒瓜。他们是中国的赫鲁晓夫手下的一伙狐群狗党。他们为了包庇夏衍等人，费尽了心血，耍尽了花招。陆定一在一次报告中说，希望夏衍“能写出好作品来，有一个好的晚年。”有人写文章批判大毒草《赛金花》（周扬提出的反动口号“国防文学”的标本），周扬之流暴跳如雷，说什么“《赛金花》不能批判了，这样要把夏衍同志搞臭了！”一句话，暴露了周扬们的隐私。原来，他们最怕把夏衍之流“搞臭”，而是要把他“搞香”！真是一群无耻之徒！
    正是为了这个罪恶目的，旧中宣部阎王殿扣压、砍杀了大量批判《林家铺子》的文章，却派出林默涵跑到苏州南园饭店，费尽心血，写了一篇题为《〈林家铺子〉是一部美化资产阶级的影片》的毒草文章，搞了一场“周瑜打黄盖”的丑剧。
    这篇文章，用尽似是而非的辞句，有意回避影片的要害，抹杀了影片为复辟资本主义大喊大叫的反动政治目的。它把夏衍有目的地反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，归结为夏衍对资产阶级改造的“奇怪看法”，“想得太天真”；并肯定夏衍是“属于世界观没有得到很好改造的作家。”文章还对夏衍心照不宣地说：希望你“能够从这次批判中得到益处。”这是一篇地地道道的假批判、真包庇的大毒草。
    从《林家铺子》的假批判中，他们得出了一条反革命经验：还是自己动手保险。根据这条“经验”，继《林家铺子》的假批判以后，他们又如法炮制，躲到大连的高级宾馆里去策划《不夜城》的假批判了。
    由林默涵等炮制的《宣扬阶级调和主义的影片〈不夜城〉》（署名阎东宾），同样回避了影片反对无产阶级专政、鼓吹复辟资本主义的严重政治问题，而对非要害的东西，却大事铺陈，津津乐道。为了替影片编导辩护，林默涵等人还玩弄了一个所谓主观、客观相矛盾的花招，胡说什么影片编导“可能是抱着”“表现我国对民族资产阶级进行社会主义改造”“这个重大的历史事件和我们党的光辉政策”的“目的来创作和拍摄”的，问题只是没有“如实反映现实”。说得多么轻松！难道只是看问题的方法不对吗？否！影片那样狂热地鼓吹“剥削有理”，那样卖力地宣扬“和平长入社会主义”，那样露骨地反对无产阶级专政，决不是偶然的。同样，你们回避影片的要害问题，也决不是偶然的，用你们自己的话来说，这叫“为亲者讳”。
    还需要提出的是，就连那样一篇对夏衍假批判的东西，周扬都怕打疼了他们的“夏衍同志”。发文之前，赶紧派人送给夏衍，“征求他的意见。”夏衍看过之后，装腔作势地找到周扬，撒娇地说：他“看了文章，连饭都吐出来了”，他实在“没有想到错误这么严重”。接着，他就提开了意见，说：“为什么有的地方不称我是同志？”“我不仅要正视错误，还要改正错误”呀，
  “我还要写出好的作品来”呀……周扬等人对夏衍百般抚慰，对他的“要求”，一一照办。在原稿“希望夏衍同志……正视影片《林家铺子》的错误”后面，周扬亲笔添上了两句话：“……并且在实际行动中改正错误，创造出更多有益于人民的作品。”（周扬感到最后一句太露骨，在发表之前删掉了。）周扬等人对此洋洋自得，立即总结出一条“经验”：“要发表批判谁的文章，可以把批判文章送给他看一看，他有不同意见，也可以提出来，我们可以再修改。”并且还订成制度，命令各报照此办理。这是什么“经验”？这是订攻守同盟，是互相勾结，抗拒群众批判的反革命鬼花招！
                    ＊＊＊
    在彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵以及背后支持他们的中国的赫鲁晓夫的策划下，一小撮反革命修正主义分子和反动“学术权威”，被包庇下来了；多少工农兵群众有生气的批判文章，被他们扼杀了。
    这场臭名昭著的假批判，是他们在无产阶级反复辟斗争面前进行拚死顽抗的罪证，是彭真炮制反革命的《二月提纲》的前奏。
      “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”在这场无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中，我们必须把这伙反革命修正主义分子以及他们的总后台，揪到光天化日之下，对他们进行彻底的批判，撤他们的职，夺他们的权，以保卫、巩固无产阶级的政权。
