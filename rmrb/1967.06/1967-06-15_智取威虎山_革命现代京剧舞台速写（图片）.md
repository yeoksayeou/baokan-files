The Battle of Mount Wuhuang
– Sketches of Revolutionary Modern Peking Opera Stage

Advancing in Victory
The pursuit team shoulders the heavy responsibility for the people,
Securing the frontline and stabilizing the rear with unwavering resolve.
Crossing steep mountains and scaling cliffs, overcoming all difficulties,
We must ensure that sunlight shines upon the deep valleys and mountains!

Strategizing
In the past few days, we have gathered significant intelligence,
Analyzing and refining our battle plans repeatedly.
Mount Wuhuang relies on its fortifications and secret passages,
It seems that victory can only be achieved through clever tactics.

Selecting the Right Person to Infiltrate
To penetrate the enemy's heart,
We must be able to strike from within and without, destroying the bandit's lair.

Ascending the Mountain to Capture the Tiger
Crossing forests and snowfields, our spirits soar,
Expressing our heroic sentiments and lofty aspirations towards the mountains.
We wish for the red flag to wave across the five continents,
Even if it means facing a sea of fire and mountains of knives, we will charge ahead.
We wish to order the flying snow to melt into spring water,
Welcoming spring and transforming the world.

Mobilizing the Masses, the Mountain People Speak Up
With sincere hearts, we can face the heavens!
Capturing the Dragon, we will dive into the vast sea,
Capturing the Tiger, we will ascend the high mountains.
A thunderous roar shakes the heavens and earth!
Seat of the Tiger!
How many more days can you last?
In the depths of the mountains, we yearn for the stars and the moon,
We only hope that the sun will rise in the mountains,
We only hope to speak before others,
We only hope to soon regain our daughters' clothing.
We only hope—to settle the eight-year account of blood and tears,
We wish we had wings, held rifles, flew to the hilltops, and exterminated the wolves!

    智取威虎山
    ——革命现代京剧舞台速写
    乘胜进军
    追剿队为人民肩负重担，
    支前线安后方志如铁坚。
    越峻岭攀绝壁冲破艰险，
    定要叫阳光普照幽谷深山！
    定计
    几天来摸敌情收获不小，
    细分析把作战计划反复推敲。
    威虎山倚仗着地堡暗道，
    看起来欲制胜以智取为高。
    选能手扮土
    匪钻进敌心窍，
    方能够里应外合捣匪巢。
    打虎上山
    穿林海跨雪原气冲霄汉，
    抒豪情寄壮志面对群山。
    愿红旗五洲四海齐招展，
    哪怕是火海刀山也扑上前。
    恨不得急令飞雪化春水，
    迎来春天换人间。
    发动群众山里人说话说了算，
    一片真心可对天！
    擒龙跟你下大海，
    打虎随你上高山。
    春雷一声天地动！
    座山雕！
    看你还能活几天！
    深山问苦盼星星盼月亮，
    只盼着深山出太阳。
    只盼着能在人前把话讲，
    只盼着早日还我女儿装。
    只盼——讨清八年血泪账，
    恨不得生翅膀、持猎枪、飞上山岗、杀尽豺狼！

    右图二　威虎厅匪徒就擒
