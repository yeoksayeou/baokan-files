The Chinese people will resolutely strike back against the anti-China provocations of the Indian reactionaries. Revolutionary masses in the capital hold angry demonstrations at the Indian embassy.

A serious warning to the Indian anti-China clowns: if you dare to persist in your course and continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, the seven hundred million Chinese people know how to deal with you.

New China News Agency, June 17th: The revolutionary masses of the capital, enraged by the fascist atrocities of the Indian reactionaries, today flocked to the gates of the Indian Embassy in China to demonstrate, strongly protesting and condemning the Indian reactionary government's instigation of mobs to crazily attack our embassy in India, insult our great leader Chairman Mao, and beat up our embassy staff. This is a serious anti-China crime. They expressed their resolute support for the protest note sent by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indian Embassy in China on the 17th.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the Indian Embassy, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and large banners. They angrily shouted, "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" "Strongly protest the Indian government's unreasonable persecution of our diplomatic personnel!" "Resolutely purge all spies of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries!" The revolutionary demonstrators repeatedly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term perspective, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

The walls of the Indian Embassy were covered with protest slogans written in Chinese, Hindi, and English. The demonstrators continuously broadcasted our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest note to the Indian Embassy in China and the protest letters from the revolutionary masses through loudspeakers. A protest letter from the Red Guards of the capital's universities and colleges said: In recent days, the Indian reactionary government has committed a series of atrocities. This is the Indian reactionary government's despicable act of revenge against the Chinese authorities' handling of the Indian spy Lu Guanshan case. We seriously warn the Indian anti-China clowns: if you dare to persist in your course and continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, the seven hundred million Chinese people know how to deal with you.

The revolutionary workers of the capital angrily shouted slogans in front of the Indian Embassy. The workers of the Beijing People's Clothing Factory Red Rebel Brigade wrote in their protest letter: The Indian spy Lu Guanshan was punished by the Chinese people, which is a well-deserved retribution for the Indian reactionaries. Now, the Indian reactionaries, in their anger and shame, are crazily seeking revenge. They openly violate the norms of international relations, instigate mobs to attack our embassy, and beat up our embassy staff. What is even more intolerable is that the Indian mobs dare to insult our great leader Chairman Mao, which is a serious provocation to the seven hundred million Chinese people. We strongly protest against the various horrifying fascist atrocities committed by the Indian reactionaries! We, the working class and the Chinese people, are closely watching the development of the situation and will give a resolute response to all the despicable acts of the Indian reactionaries!

The Chinese staff of the Indian Embassy in China also participated in the demonstration of the revolutionary masses in the capital today. They also read the protest letter to the acting charge d'affaires of the Indian Embassy in China in person.

    中国人民将坚决回击印度反动派的反华挑衅
    首都革命群众向印度使馆愤怒示威
    严重警告印度反华小丑：如果你们胆敢一意孤行，继续与中国人民为敌，七亿中国人民是懂得怎样对付你们的
    新华社十七日讯　被印度反动派法西斯暴行激怒了的首都广大革命群众，今天纷纷涌到印度驻华使馆门前示威，强烈抗议和谴责印度反动政府指使暴徒疯狂袭击我国驻印度大使馆，侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，殴打我大使馆人员的严重反华罪行，表示坚决拥护我国外交部十七日给印度驻华大使馆的抗议照会。
    聚集在印度驻华使馆门前的成千上万的示威群众，抬着毛主席巨幅画像、毛主席语录和巨幅标语，愤怒高呼：“打倒印度反动派！”“强烈抗议印度政府无理迫害我外交人员！”“坚决肃清一切帝、修、反的间谍分子！”示威的革命群众一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    在印度大使馆的墙上，贴满了用中文、印地文和英文书写的抗议标语。示威群众用扩音器不断播送我国外交部给印度驻华大使馆的抗议照会和革命群众的抗议书。首都大专院校红代会的一封抗议书说：连日来，印度反动政府制造了一系列的暴行，这是印度反动政府对中国有关当局处理印度间谍鲁冠南案件所采取的卑劣的报复行动。我们严重警告印度反华的小丑们，如果你们胆敢一意孤行，继续与中国人民为敌，七亿中国人民是懂得怎样对付你们的。
    首都的革命工人在印度大使馆门前愤怒地高呼口号。北京人民服装厂红色造反纵队的职工在抗议书上说：印度间谍分子鲁冠南受到中国人民的惩罚，这是印度反动派咎由自取，是一件大快人心的事情。现在，印度反动派恼羞成怒，疯狂地进行报复，竟然公开违反国际关系准则，指使暴徒袭击我国大使馆，并且毒打我使馆工作人员。尤其不能容忍的是，印度暴徒竟敢侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，这是对七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。对于印度反动派制造的种种骇人听闻的法西斯暴行，我们表示最最强烈的抗议！我们工人阶级和中国人民一道，正密切注视着事态的发展，对印度反动派的一切卑劣行径将给予坚决的回击！
    印度驻华大使馆的中国职工，今天也参加了首都革命群众示威的行列。他们还当面向印度驻华大使馆临时代办宣读了抗议书。
