New Delhi, June 18 (Xinhua) - The Indian reactionary government on June 17 continued to instigate and connive with thugs to violate international norms, invading the Chinese Embassy in India to carry out destructive activities. The safety of the embassy staff continues to be seriously threatened.

On the morning of June 17, a group of Indian thugs climbed over the wall into the Chinese Embassy compound, setting fire to two cars that had been destroyed by thugs the previous day. On June 16, the Indian government instigated a large number of thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy, burning four cars and one motorcycle. In the morning, the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires Chen Shaoyuan was inspecting the damaged situation within the embassy compound when Indian spy elements threw stones at him and injured the right foot of an embassy staff member.

Indian reactionary police and spies have repeatedly threatened Indian staff working at the Chinese Embassy, obstructing their normal work, and even beating Indian security guards.

The Chinese Embassy has already protested to the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of June 17 regarding the thugs' invasion of the embassy to burn cars and the police and spies' beating of security guards, and demanded that such atrocities be stopped. In the afternoon of June 17, several hundred thugs shouted reactionary slogans in front of the Chinese Embassy, insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. In the evening, thugs continued to shout anti-China slogans near the embassy.

Eight embassy staff members who were injured by the thugs on June 16 remained in danger on June 17.
