	Sing Loudly of the Red Sun	Naval Political Work Troupe Orchestra Red Rebel Fleet  Zhang Qi
	In the early spring of 1953, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the vast lands of the south and north, boarded the warship, and reviewed our naval forces. He had a warm conversation with the sailors and personally inscribed, instructing us: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a powerful navy." This is the highest directive from our most beloved great leader to the navy, the greatest concern for all naval officers and soldiers!

	"The Chairman Comes to Our Warship" reflects this glorious history of our naval forces. Therefore, when this performance was first staged in 1964, it immediately enraged the biggest group of capitalist-roaders within the party. The Chinese Khrushchev, without even watching the performance, eagerly blurted out: "The direction is correct, but the artistry is poor, and it will be criticized and toppled." The capitalist-roaders within the military viciously said: "The beloved Chairman is sung too much, it's not moving." Another counter-revolutionary revisionist also, during our intense rehearsals, repeatedly tried to sabotage the performance. They maliciously attacked and deliberately obstructed, aiming to strangle this performance, not allowing us to praise the great leader Chairman Mao, not allowing us to sing the boundless glory of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The biggest capitalist-roader within the party fiercely opposed Chairman Mao. In 1958, he also used the pretext of inspecting the navy to board the warship that Chairman Mao had once been on. The comrades on the ship told him about our great leader Chairman Mao inspecting the navy on this warship and pointed to the chair that Chairman Mao had sat on, saying: The sailors cherish this chair very much, taking special care of it, and even allowing visitors to sit on it for a few minutes feels like an unparalleled honor. The Chinese Khrushchev heard this and maliciously said: "You can sit on it, it's against personality cultism!" Barely concealing his wolfish ambition to oppose Chairman Mao.

	In 1959, this biggest capitalist-roader within the party openly issued a black directive, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of building the navy. He blabbered about building the navy to develop our maritime industry. Isn't this clearly telling us not to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, not to oppose American imperialism, and to put down our guns to go fishing and catch shrimp for business? This fully exposed his counter-revolutionary revisionist face.

	Today, we, the revolutionary rebels of the three military art troupes, have overcome numerous difficulties and performed this show magnificently again. This is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will forever, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration, sing loudly of the boundless glory of Mao Zedong Thought, sing loudly of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!

    放声歌唱红太阳	海政文工团军乐队红色造反舰队  张琦
    一九五三年的初春，我们的伟大领袖毛主席巡视大江南北，登上战舰，检阅了我们海军部队。他老人家和水兵们做了亲切的谈话，并亲笔题词，教导我们：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”这是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖对海军的最高指示，对全体海军指战员的最大关怀！
    《毛主席来到我们军舰上》反映的就是我海军部队的这一光荣历史。正因为这样，这个节目在一九六四年刚一搬上舞台，就触怒了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。中国的赫鲁晓夫还没有看节目就迫不及待地胡说：“光方向对头，艺术上搞不好，叫人家一批就批倒了。”军内走资本主义道路的当权派则恶狠狠地说：“敬爱的毛主席唱的太多了，就不感人了。”另一个反革命修正主义分子也在我们紧张排演的时刻，三番五次来拆台。他们这样恶意攻击，百般刁难，目的就是要扼杀这个节目，就是不许我们歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，不让我们歌颂光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派疯狂地反对毛主席，一九五八年，他也借视察海军为名，来到了当年毛主席乘坐的这条军舰。舰上的同志向他谈到我们伟大领袖毛主席在这条军舰上检阅海军，并指着毛主席坐过的一把椅子说：水兵们十分爱护这把椅子，平时特别加以保养，外来参观的同志能坐上一两分钟都感到无尚的光荣。中国的赫鲁晓夫一听到这里，就恶毒地说：“可以坐嘛，反对个人崇拜嘛！”赤裸裸地暴露了他反对毛主席的狼子野心。
    一九五九年，这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，又公开发出黑指示，与毛主席的建立海军的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。他胡说什么建立海军是为了发展我国的海洋事业。这不明明是要我们不听毛主席的教导，不去反对美帝国主义，放下枪杆子去打鱼摸虾做生意吗？这就充分地暴露了他反革命修正主义的面目。
    今天，我们三军文艺单位的革命造反派，克服了重重困难，又把这个节目隆重演出了。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。我们要永远以无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，放声歌唱光焰无际的毛泽东思想，放声歌唱我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！
