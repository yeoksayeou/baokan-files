The British imperialists, in disregard of repeated warnings from the 700 million people of China and the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, have today dispatched the recently arrived aircraft carrier "Eagle" to participate in military exercises in Hong Kong, daring to provoke China at its southern gate.

According to reports from Hong Kong newspapers, this exercise involves helicopters, marine assault troops from the "Eagle," and British troops stationed in Hong Kong. The location is the small island of Lantau near Hong Kong. The exercise includes "reconnaissance," "infantry drills," and other activities. In recent days, the number of British warships entering Hong Kong has significantly increased, reaching eleven on the 29th, and still eight were anchored in Hong Kong's inner harbor at noon on the 31st. Meanwhile, the commander of the British Royal Army's Welsh Regiment, Brock, arrived in Hong Kong by plane from London on the 30th to engage in conspiratorial activities.

The British imperialists' series of military activities in Hong Kong are intended to bolster the bloodthirsty Hong Kong authorities in their suppression of our compatriots, attempting to salvage their crumbling empire from the trash heap and extinguish the blazing fire of the Hong Kong compatriots' anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle. The decaying British imperialists are truly "like ants shaking a great tree, laughably overestimating themselves!" The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon have already taken action, determined to thoroughly settle accounts with the British imperialists for their heinous crimes in Hong Kong. No matter how desperately the British imperialists struggle, they cannot escape being engulfed in the vast sea of the Hong Kong compatriots' anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle.

    蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量 
    英帝竟敢在港举行军事演习向我挑衅
    新华社香港三十一日电　英帝国主义竟不顾我国七亿人民和香港中国同胞的一再警告，今天派遣最近开到香港的航空母舰“堡垒号”参加在香港举行的军事演习，胆敢在我国南大门挑衅。
    据香港报纸报道，这次演习由“堡垒号”派出的直升飞机、海军突击部队和英国驻在香港的军队联合举行。地点在香港附近的小岛大屿山。演习内容包括“侦察”、“步兵演习”等等。这几天来，开进香港的英国军舰有显著增加，二十九日竟多至十一艘，三十一日中午还有八艘停泊在香港内海。与此同时，英国皇家陆军威尔斯团团长布洛克在三十日由伦敦乘飞机到香港，进行阴谋活动。
    英帝国主义在香港进行一连串的军事活动，是给血腥镇压我同胞的港英当局打气，妄图从垃圾堆里拾起破烂，来扑灭越烧越旺的香港同胞反帝抗暴的熊熊烈火。衰朽透顶的英帝国主义这样做，真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量！”港九爱国同胞已经行动起来了，他们决定彻底清算英帝国主义在香港犯下的种种滔天罪行。任凭英帝国主义怎样垂死挣扎，也逃不了陷身于香港同胞反帝抗暴斗争的汪洋大海中。
