The Indian reactionaries are the architects of the great famine. The Indian people have no way out but to make a revolution.

The severe famine in India has lasted for four years. The people's anti-hunger struggle is continuing to deepen. Although the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are strongly supporting the Indian reactionary regime, food production and supply show no signs of improvement. An Indian high-ranking official exclaimed: "If the situation continues to deteriorate, a great revolution will break out, and the entire social structure will collapse."

The Indian reactionary government has tried every means to make people believe that the famine is caused by natural disasters. Not long ago, the new Indian Foreign Minister Chagla even said that the "threat from China" had caused India's serious economic difficulties. However, such absurd lies cannot cover up the reality in India.

Among India's nearly 500 million people, the vast majority are impoverished farmers. During the colonial era, the vast majority of Indian farmers were at the bottom of the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, suffering greatly. After India's independence, the Indian National Congress government, representing the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landlord class, neither wanted to nor could solve the problems of farmers and land. As soon as it came to power, it brutally suppressed farmers who insisted on anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. It cherished the landlord class. Although it carried out a so-called "land reform," its purpose was only to deceive the farmers and did not change the feudal land system or harm the landlord class in the slightest. Towards imperialist forces, the Indian reactionary government welcomed them all. Over the past decade, British investment has increased every year, and especially American forces have also made a significant inroad, gaining a position to control the Indian reactionary ruling clique. In reality, India is now nothing more than a new type of colony with an independent label. This is the fundamental cause of the famine in India.

The only way the Indian reactionary government has dealt with the famine is to beg the United States for food. Since 1956, the total amount of American grain imported by India has exceeded 50 million tons. The United States provides tens of billions of dollars in food "aid," of course, not because it is benevolent. Its purpose is, on the one hand, to further control India's economic lifeline and internal and external affairs through these "aid" grains, making India completely a colony of the United States; on the other hand, the United States uses these "aid" to strengthen the Indian reactionary ruling clique, suppress the Indian people, and fully obstruct the development of the revolutionary movement.

The result of "American aid" is not only that it cannot solve India's food crisis but also that it promotes the colonization of Indian society, making various contradictions further develop. Therefore, the more "aid" there is, the more serious India's food crisis becomes, which has become a rule. Therefore, although the United States "aids" India with wheat every year, reaching one-third of the United States' annual production, it is still far from meeting the needs. The Johnson administration has already felt overwhelmed and is asking international imperialists, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries to work together to transfuse blood for the Indian reactionary ruling clique.

The Soviet revisionists, although their own agricultural production is in a very bad state, also scrambled together and squeezed out 200,000 tons of grain to "donate" to the Indian authorities. The Soviet revisionist propaganda machine, on the other hand, tries every means to whitewash the Indian reactionary ruling clique. The reporter of *Pravda* did not mention the famine in his report on his visit to India but instead boasted about India's achievements. This reporter wrote: "Its achievements are countless. Among the products produced in this country, many have reached the highest level of world achievements." The Soviet *Izvestia* went even further in its madness, slandering the anti-hunger struggles of tens of millions of Indian people as being "organized by reactionary forces for the purpose of provocation" and as "lawlessness." Such a method of inverting black and white is truly shameless to the extreme!

The Soviet revisionists' faithful running dogs, the Danji traitor clique, are also busy, serving the big landlords and big bourgeoisie in India. It repeatedly advocates that India can "establish socialism" through "peaceful transition," thereby numbing the Indian people and helping the Indian government maintain its reactionary rule.

In the anti-hunger struggle, the broad masses of the Indian people have increasingly realized that the Indian reactionary ruling clique, representing the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, is the chief culprit in suppressing the farmers' movement and creating the great famine. Only by taking the revolutionary road can the problem of food be solved. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the famine is most severe, the demonstrators loudly shouted: "Long live the revolution!" In some areas, the demonstrators have gradually developed from seizing food to seizing weapons from the military and police, using armed struggle to counter the reactionary government's armed suppression. Through long-term struggle, the advanced Indian people have begun to realize that only a revolutionary government can permanently eliminate the threat of hunger.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious."

The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the Indian people. The Indian people will surely break through all obstacles and advance swiftly on the revolutionary road.

### 印度反动派是大饥荒的制造者  印度人民不闹革命无生路

    印度反动派是大饥荒的制造者
    印度人民不闹革命无生路
    本报记者述评　印度严重饥荒，已经持续达四年之久。全国各地人民展开的反饥饿斗争，正在继续深入发展。美帝苏修虽然大力支持印度反动当局，但是粮食生产和供应仍然没有丝毫好转迹象。印度的一个高级官员惊呼：“如果情况继续恶化，则大革命即将爆发，整个社会结构将告崩溃”。
    印度反动政府千方百计要人们相信，饥荒是自然灾害造成的。不久以前，印度新任外交部长查格拉还说什么“中国的威胁”，造成了印度的严重的经济困难。然而，这种荒唐的谎言，并不能掩盖印度的现实情况。
    印度近五亿人口中，绝大多数是贫苦农民。在殖民地时代，印度广大农民处在帝国主义、封建主义压迫的最底层，处于水深火热之中。印度独立后，代表大资产阶级、大地主阶级利益的国大党政府根本不愿意也根本不可能解决农民问题和土地问题。它一上台，就对坚持反帝、反封建的农民，进行血腥的镇压。对地主阶级却爱护备至。它虽然实行了一次所谓“土地改革”，但是其目的只是为了欺骗农民，根本未改变封建土地制度，也未伤害地主阶级一根毫毛。对帝国主义势力，印度反动政府是来者不拒的。十几年来，英国投资年年增加，特别是美国势力也大举侵入，取得了左右印度反动统治集团的地位。实际上，目前的印度只不过是一个挂着独立招牌的新型殖民地而已。这是造成印度饥荒的根本原因。
    印度反动当局应付饥荒的唯一办法是向美国乞求粮食。从一九五六年以来，印度进口的美国粮食总数在五千万吨以上。美国提供数十亿美元的粮食“援助”，当然绝不是因为它乐善好施。它的目的是，一方面通过这些美“援”粮食，进一步控制印度的经济命脉和内政、外交大权，使印度完全沦为美国的殖民地；另一方面，美国利用这些“援助”，加强印度反动统治集团，镇压印度人民，全力阻止革命运动发展。
    “美援”的结果不仅解决不了印度的粮食危机，反而促进印度社会的殖民地化，使它各种矛盾进一步发展。因此，“美援”越多，印度的粮食危机也就更严重，这已是一个规律。因此，美国每年“援”印小麦，虽然达到美国年产量的三分之一，但仍然远远不能满足需要。约翰逊政府已经感到力不从心，要求国际帝修反共同努力，为印度反动统治集团输血。
    苏修自己农业生产状况虽然十分不妙，也东拼西凑，挤出二十万吨粮食“赠予”印度当局。苏修的宣传机器，则千方百计为印度反动统治集团涂脂抹粉。《真理报》记者在访问印度的报道中只字不提饥荒，反而大肆吹嘘印度的成就。这家报纸记者写道：“它的成就是数不完的。在这个国家生产的产品中有许多已经达到世界成就的最高水平”。苏联《消息报》更丧心病狂地污蔑印度千百万人民的反饥饿斗争，是“反动势力”为了“挑衅的目的”而组织起来的，是“胡作非为”。这种颠倒黑白的叛徒手法，真是无耻到了极点！
    苏修在印度的忠实走狗丹吉叛徒集团，也加紧活动，为印度大地主、大资产阶级效劳。它不断宣扬，印度可以通过“和平过渡”来“建立社会主义”，以此来麻痹印度人民，帮助印度政府维持其反动统治。
    在反饥饿斗争中，印度广大人民已经越来越认识到，代表大地主、大资产阶级利益的印度反动统治集团，是扼杀农民运动的罪魁祸首，是大饥荒的制造者。只有走革命的道路，吃饭问题才有可能解决。在饥荒最严重的北方邦，示威群众响亮地高呼：“革命万岁！”有些地区的示威群众已经从抢夺粮食，逐步发展为抢夺军警武器，以武装斗争，来回击反动政府的武装镇压。在长期的斗争中，先进的印度人民已经开始认清，只有革命政权，才能永远免除饥饿的威胁。
    毛主席指出：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，日益深入印度人心。印度人民必将冲破一切网罗，迅猛地在革命的道路上前进。
