Currently, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership are tightening their collusion, using the United Nations, which they control, to extinguish the flames of anti-American struggle in the Arab countries. This once again exposes the United Nations as a tool for U.S.-Soviet suppression of the struggles of the peoples of various countries.

For many years, the United Nations has been used by U.S. imperialism to promote its policy of aggression and war. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to pursue the line of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," has been colluding with U.S. imperialism in the United Nations, using it as a political marketplace for Sino-Soviet cooperation. They control the United Nations and pass one resolution after another to interfere with and invade the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Before Khrushchev's downfall, in 1960 and 1961, the United Nations Security Council passed five resolutions in succession, organizing and dispatching "United Nations forces" to arm and suppress the Congolese (Zaire) people's revolution. The Soviet representative openly voted in favor of all of them. After Khrushchev's fall, the Soviet revisionist leadership faithfully inherited Khrushchev's legacy. In December 1964, the Soviet representative again voted in favor of a resolution in the Security Council that did not condemn the U.S.-Belgian armed invasion of Congo (Zaire), but only advocated "ceasefire" and "national reconciliation."

The Soviet revisionist leadership supported the United States in using the United Nations to dispatch the so-called "United Nations Peacekeeping Forces" to Cyprus, interfering in Cyprus' internal affairs. Despite the opposition of the Cypriot people, since March 1964, they have repeatedly, together with the United States, voted in favor of extending the stay of the United Nations intervention forces in the Security Council, causing these intervention forces to remain to this day.

The Soviet revisionist leadership also conspired with the United States and Britain to manipulate the Security Council to pass a resolution in November 1965, entrusting the British government, which supports white colonial rule, to "pacify" the unilateral declaration of "independence" by the white colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia. The Soviet government even issued a special statement, declaring that it "fully supports" and "absolutely executes" the United Nations resolution.

In September 1965, when Pakistan counterattacked the armed invasion of the Indian reactionaries, the Soviet Union, together with the United States, in the Security Council, sided with the Indian reactionaries, supported the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant's unfair report, and passed four resolutions in a row, forcing Pakistan to accept a "ceasefire" favorable to India.

In May 1965, after the United States sent troops to suppress the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Dominican people, the Soviet Union in the Security Council not only voted with the United States to authorize the United Nations Secretary-General to send representatives to the Dominican Republic to "investigate," allowing the United States to further interfere in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic through the United Nations, but also voted in favor of the so-called "permanent ceasefire" in the Dominican Republic, attempting to force the Dominican patriotic military and civilians to lay down their arms.

At the same time, the Soviet revisionist leadership collaborated with U.S. imperialism in the United Nations to launch a large-scale anti-China campaign, create a "peace talk" hoax on the Vietnam issue, make a big fuss about the "prevention of nuclear proliferation," and tighten collusion on the issue of establishing "United Nations forces." They also helped the United States use the United Nations to pass "aid" and other deceptive means to politically interfere with, economically infiltrate, and culturally corrupt various countries.

At the end of last year's 21st United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet revisionist leadership blatantly colluded with U.S. imperialism and did a lot of bad things, including passing a so-called "treaty on the peaceful use of outer space" in the United Nations, creating an illusion of "peace" and "disarmament" in front of the world's people. A large amount of evidence shows that as long as U.S. imperialism has any need, the Soviet revisionist leadership will help it in the United Nations.

    联合国是美帝苏修镇压人民革命的工具
    据新华社讯　目前，美帝国主义同苏修领导集团加紧勾结，利用它们控制的联合国扑灭阿拉伯各国人民反美斗争烈火，这再次暴露了联合国是美苏镇压各国人民斗争的工具。
    多年来，联合国一直被美帝国主义利用来推行它的侵略政策和战争政策。苏联修正主义领导集团为了推行“苏美合作主宰世界”的路线，加紧在联合国勾结美帝国主义，把联合国当作苏美合作的政治交易所，它们控制联合国，通过了一个又一个的干涉和侵略亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的决议。
    在赫鲁晓夫下台以前，一九六○年和一九六一年，联合国安全理事会先后通过了五个决议，组织和派遣“联合国军”，武装镇压刚果（金）人民革命，苏联代表公然一概投票赞成。赫鲁晓夫垮台后，苏修领导集团忠实继承了赫鲁晓夫的衣钵。一九六四年十二月，苏联代表又在安理会投票赞成没有谴责美比武装侵略刚果（金），只搞“停火”、“实现全国和解”的决议。
    苏修领导集团支持美国利用联合国派遣所谓“联合国维持和平部队”进驻塞浦路斯，干涉塞浦路斯的内部事务。它们不顾塞浦路斯人民的反对，自一九六四年三月以来，一再和美国一起在安理会投票赞成延长联合国干涉部队的驻扎期限，致使这支干涉部队到现在还赖着不走。
    苏修领导集团还同美、英合谋，操纵安理会在一九六五年十一月通过决议，委托支持白人殖民统治的英国政府去“平定”南罗得西亚白人殖民当局单方面宣布“独立”的行动。苏联政府并特地发表声明，宣称它“完全支持”和“绝对执行”联合国的决议。
    一九六五年九月，当巴基斯坦反击印度反动派的武装侵略时，苏联在安理会与美国一起偏袒印度反动派，支持联合国秘书长吴丹不公正的报告，并一连作出四个决议，强迫巴基斯坦接受有利于印度的“停火”。
    一九六五年五月，美国出兵镇压多米尼加人民反美爱国斗争后，苏联在安理会不但同美国一起投票授权联合国秘书长派代表去多米尼加“调查”，让美国通过联合国进一步干涉多米尼加内政，并且投票赞成在多米尼加实行所谓“永久性停火”，企图迫使多米尼加爱国军民放下武器。
    与此同时，苏联修正主义领导集团配合美帝国主义在联合国内大肆反华，就越南问题制造“和谈”骗局，在“防止核扩散”问题上大作文章，在建立“联合国部队”问题上加紧勾结。他们并且帮助美国利用联合国通过“援助”等欺骗方式，对各国进行政治干涉、经济渗透和文化腐蚀。
    在去年年底收场的第二十一届联合国大会上，苏修领导集团更是露骨地勾结美帝国主义，干下了一大堆坏事，包括它们在联合国搞成了一项所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”，在世界人民面前制造所谓“和平”、“裁军”的幻觉。大量事实证明，只要美帝国主义有什么需要，苏修领导集团就在联合国里为它帮忙。
