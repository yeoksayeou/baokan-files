Mao Zedong Thought is guiding the ballet revolution – a class struggle surrounding the creation of "The Red Detachment of Women"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries, who fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, are also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Looking back at the struggles between the two classes and the two lines in the literary and artistic circles over the past seventeen years since the founding of the nation, it is actually a political struggle of restoration and anti-restoration, seizure of power and anti-seizure of power. The number one capitalist-roaders within the Party, together with a gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo-han, have long been fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, actively promoting the revisionist black line in literature and art, and creating public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. It is under these circumstances that Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, broke through the repeated obstacles from the Party's biggest capitalist-roader in power and the old Propaganda Department, the old Cultural Department, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and bravely advanced, bringing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art into the literary and artistic circles and also into our ballet troupe. The revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" was created under the personal guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing and in the midst of continuous struggles against the revisionist black line in literature and art. Its creation process experienced a sharp and tortuous class struggle.

Should ballet be used to express modern revolutionary themes? In other words, does ballet serve the bourgeoisie or the workers, peasants, and soldiers? Does it serve a small handful of people or the seven hundred million people? This is the fundamental issue of the ballet revolution and also the first struggle encountered in the creation of "The Red Detachment of Women."

In the world, many countries have the art form of ballet, so some people call it an "international language." However, like other art forms, "ballet belongs to a certain class and a certain political line." Since its birth, the art form of ballet has been monopolized by the bourgeoisie and serves bourgeois politics. It only expresses kings, nobles, gentlemen, and ladies, as well as swans and fairies. In recent years, the modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union not only inherited the old ballet but also further staged performances like "Forty-One" and "The Soldier and the Devil's Song," which advocate class reconciliation, express the horror of war, and promote pacifism, serving their revisionist political line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art belong to the people, primarily to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Ballet art must also serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, our country's ballet completely copied the bourgeoisie and the modern revisionists in the Soviet Union, performing things like "Swan Lake," "The Water Sprite," "Giselle," "The Fountain of Tears," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and "The Fairies," spreading the stench of the bourgeoisie and revisionism, poisoning and corrupting our people, and creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Can we tolerate such a situation? No, not even for a day. We must carry out a ballet revolution. However, the Party's biggest capitalist-roader in power did everything possible to stop this revolution, saying things like "reflecting modern life cannot be forced" and "ballet and foreign operas do not necessarily have to reflect [modern life]," and also saying that "watching 'Swan Lake' can lift one's spirits, and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' has a high artistic level and educational value." In 1964, he even loudly proclaimed that ballet cannot be reformed, that it must be foreign to the core, and that it must be learned thoroughly. His loyal followers also slandered the ballet reform as "using the proletarian dictatorship to impose on the masses, resulting in something that is neither fish nor fowl." They opposed and attacked the ballet reform so fiercely because they wanted Chinese ballet to follow the capitalist and revisionist path. Comrade Jiang Qing sternly refuted their reactionary fallacies, resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and thoroughly transformed this foreign art form, making it "foreign for the benefit of China," so that it would serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and have a Chinese style and Chinese spirit. Comrade Jiang Qing said: Ballet has been performed in foreign countries for hundreds of years, but now Western ballet is decadent and declining. The red flag of ballet revolution must be carried by us. Comrade Jiang Qing encouraged us to have a global vision, not just to serve a few people, but to serve all the people of China, to serve the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to have ambition and spirit, and to believe that we can definitely find our own path.

The first step of the ballet revolution and the success or failure of the first performance are of great significance; while the choice of theme is one of the keys to the success or failure of a performance. When choosing the script, Lin Mo-han immediately proposed to rehearse "Daji and Her Father," which advocates bourgeois human sentiment, attempting to lead the ballet revolution astray. At this critical juncture, Comrade Jiang Qing firmly grasped the revolutionary direction and decisively chose to rehearse "The Red Detachment of Women," which expresses Chairman Mao's people's war thoughts, smashing their plot.

However, the enemy was not willing to accept their failure and continued to sabotage and disrupt the rehearsal of "The Red Detachment of Women" in new ways. On the one hand, they paid lip service but resisted in practice, spreading defeatist views everywhere, saying things like "rehearsing revolutionary plays will inevitably go through a process of over-correction, and classical plays will still be performed in the future, you cannot abandon them." At the same time, they played the trick of pulling the rug out from under us, using the pretext of performing in Hong Kong to withdraw a batch of main performers to continue rehearsing "Swan Lake," attempting to sabotage the rehearsal of "The Red Detachment of Women." This trick was immediately criticized by Premier Zhou and resisted by the revolutionary masses of the troupe, and it did not succeed. But they were still not willing to give up. When "The Red Detachment of Women" was initially rehearsed, the Zhou Yang gang immediately jumped out, pouring cold water and saying in a sarcastic tone: "It's not clear, the artistic level is too low, it's chaotic, it cannot be shown to foreigners, foreigners will not acknowledge it," and so on. At this critical juncture, it was Comrade Jiang Qing who supported us again. The day after she watched the dress rehearsal, she personally came to the troupe to talk with us, fully affirming the achievements of the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women." Comrade Jiang Qing said: This play should write about the theme of people's war, write about the heroic image of the proletariat, and express the revolutionary spirit of never letting the red flag fall in any situation. She required "The Red Detachment of Women" to create a brilliant image of heroic figures and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the broad masses of viewers.

We will never, never forget October 8, 1964. A red sun shone on the ballet stage, and our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, watched the performance of "The Red Detachment of Women." For this newly born ballet, Chairman Mao gave it a high evaluation. He said: "The direction is correct, the revolution is successful, and the art is also good." Chairman Mao's instructions were the greatest care, encouragement, and support for "The Red Detachment of Women" and the entire ballet revolution, and the most powerful blow to the Party's biggest capitalist-roader in power and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and the like. What is infuriating is that the morning after Chairman Mao watched the performance, Lin Mo-han rushed to the troupe, strictly sealing off Chairman Mao's evaluation of "The Red Detachment of Women," but maliciously slandering: "Revolutionary plays in Peking opera are like children wearing split pants, while 'The Red Detachment of Women' can only be said to be like a baby in swaddling clothes," and saying things like "an ugly daughter-in-law will eventually have to meet her mother-in-law," attempting to offset the great political impact of our great leader Chairman Mao watching the performance. However, Chairman Mao's voice cannot be sealed off, and the revolutionary tide is unstoppable. Chairman Mao's teachings pointed out the direction for us to advance. China's first revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" finally broke through countless obstacles and difficulties and was successfully born. It stands proudly on the socialist literary and artistic stage with brilliant light!

II

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the working people: one of the two must be chosen." The entire history of the art stage proves this. The bourgeois ballet praises the representatives of the bourgeoisie, and even when it describes the working people, the images are distorted and vilified. The proletarian ballet must praise the representatives of the proletariat and perform the images of heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Surrounding the creation of "The Red Detachment of Women," there was also a struggle, mainly focusing on two issues: how to correctly create the images of positive characters such as Wu Qinghua, Hong Changqing, and the platoon leader; and how to correctly handle the relationship between positive and negative characters. Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, refuted the various fallacies of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang and his gang, who did not write about heroic figures but focused on intermediate figures, and did not highlight positive figures but focused on depicting negative figures. She clearly proposed to use all means on the stage to establish heroic figures, and to establish them as tall and perfect, not allowing any detail to damage the heroic image. Negative figures should also be created, but positive figures must overwhelm them.

Wu Qinghua is a laboring people who suffered in the old society and is a typical figure who went from spontaneous resistance to conscious struggle. In the ballet, she should express her resistance and struggle and her growth under the leadership of the Party. However, the capitalist-roader in power within our troupe wanted the performers to create the image of Wu Qinghua in the tune of the revisionist ballet "The Fountain of Tears," where the feudal queen Zalima is depicted. They also attempted to use the bourgeois ballet style to make the original character Honglian in the ballet light and fluffy, like a fairy descending to the mortal world. Comrade Jiang Qing timely exposed their plots and tricks, resolutely removed the character Honglian, and personally helped us analyze the thoughts and feelings of Wu Qinghua, Hong Changqing, and the platoon leader many times, study the dance design, and point out where to focus on description. Hong Changqing is an even more brilliant proletarian hero, and Comrade Jiang Qing repeatedly emphasized that his heroic spirit must be expressed, especially in the dance scene of his heroic death, which must express his great righteousness and unyielding revolutionary spirit.

Comrade Jiang Qing also required that the revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form be highly unified, pursuing excellence and constantly improving. She made strict requirements for the makeup, costumes, and props of the characters. For example, to highlight the image of positive characters, the clothes of the Red Army must not have a single speck of dirt, and the red armbands and red five-pointed stars must have gold edges. The dance form and music form must serve to highlight the heroic figures. Comrade Jiang Qing's strong proletarian feelings and serious, meticulous working attitude inspired us to strive to create the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers and charge forward for the new proletarian literature and art.

III

Through the rehearsal and performance of "The Red Detachment of Women," we deeply felt that whether or not to create proletarian heroic figures is a matter of stance; whether or not to create good proletarian heroic figures is a matter of class feelings. The solution to these two problems lies in the thought revolutionization of literary and artistic workers. To perform revolutionary plays, one must first become a revolutionary. Otherwise, as Chairman Mao criticized: "If one describes, the clothes are those of the laboring people, but the face is that of a petty-bourgeois intellectual."

For a long time, our ballet troupe, under the control of the revisionist black line in literature and art, was completely infatuated with the "big, foreign, and ancient" performances, seriously detached from the reality of struggle and life, and detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. At that time, the capitalist-roader in power within the troupe did not allow us to go deep into factories, rural areas, and the army. An actor who requested to go down to experience life was even ridiculed, and they said, "You go first at the next banquet." Lin Mo-han also said, "There is no need to go deep into life, just watch a few movies and learn a little." Comrade Jiang Qing, in response to this situation, timely sounded the alarm for us, urging us to study Chairman Mao's works well and highlight political and ideological education. For the creation of "The Red Detachment of Women," Comrade Jiang Qing not only went to Hainan Island herself, thousands of miles away, to conduct a systematic and meticulous investigation of the places where the Red Detachment of Women had once been active, but also organized us to go to Hainan Island to experience life, to join the troops, and to work in factories. In the midst of real-life struggles and interactions with workers, peasants, and soldiers, we received profound education. The selfless and noble qualities of the working class, the spirit of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight spirit, all promoted our thought revolutionization. Only workers, peasants, and soldiers are the most noble people in the world. Can we sing the praises of the bourgeoisie instead of them? Can we serve the bourgeoisie instead of serving them? No, absolutely not. We must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and let the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers forever stand on the ballet stage.

In the process of experiencing life, we further understood Chairman Mao's teachings: We must definitely move our standpoint "to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have true literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, true proletarian literature and art." Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings, the ballet revolution will not be half-hearted. Only in this way can we relatively well create the heroic images in "The Red Detachment of Women." For example, the actor who played Wu Qinghua initially performed and performed, but the Red Detachment of Women on stage was still a "woman," not a "soldier" at all. After experiencing life, she received deep education. Especially, an old mother in Hainan Island's experience deepened her understanding of the character Wu Qinghua. This old mother was sold to a landlord at the age of seven and escaped eight times in ten years. Each time she was caught by the landlord and beaten, she was even hung over a fire pit and roasted with fire, but this old mother never shed a tear in front of the landlord and finally escaped from the jaws of the tiger. The old mother's strong spirit of resistance was exactly the firm character that Wu Qinghua should have. After a period of life training, when this actor played Wu Qinghua again, she had a basis, and the character's image began to take shape. Other comrades also strengthened their class feelings when creating the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Of course, this is just the beginning. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, long-term deepen into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, undergo a thorough transformation, and truly move our standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The birth of the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" is a great revolution led by revolutionary literary and artistic workers under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, rebelling against bourgeois ballet art and revisionist ballet art, and setting a model for world revolutionary literature and art.

The birth of the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" declares to the world: Ballet has been reborn, and the old ballet that serves the bourgeoisie and poisons the people in China has disappeared forever. Our country's ballet, with a new posture and a heroic stride, marches in the great army of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. Under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary ballet, with its boundless vitality, opens a new era in world ballet art; it will definitely present a more brilliant prospect and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and proletarian politics!

    毛泽东思想指引着芭蕾舞革命
    ——围绕《红色娘子军》创作的一场阶级斗争
    工农兵芭蕾舞剧团　群英
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”回顾建国十七年来文艺界两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，实际上也就是一场复辟和反复辟、夺权和反夺权的政治斗争。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，纠集了彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵等一伙反革命修正主义分子，长期以来疯狂地对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，积极推行修正主义的文艺黑线，为他们复辟资本主义制造舆论。就在这种情况下，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，冲破党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委重重阻挠，披荆斩棘，奋勇前进，把毛主席的革命文艺路线带进了文艺界，也带进了我们芭蕾舞剧团。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，就是在江青同志亲自指导下，同修正主义文艺黑线不断进行斗争中创作成功的。它的创作过程，经历了一场尖锐的曲折的阶级斗争。
                           一　
    芭蕾舞要不要、能不能表现革命现代题材？也就是说，芭蕾舞是为资产阶级服务还是为工农兵服务？是为一小撮人服务还是为七亿人民服务？这是芭蕾舞革命的根本问题，也是《红色娘子军》创作中遇到的第一场斗争。
    在世界上，许多国家都有芭蕾舞这种艺术形式，所以有人把它称为“国际语言”。但是，芭蕾舞和其他艺术形式一样，“都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”芭蕾舞这种艺术形式，自它诞生以来，就是为资产阶级所垄断，为资产阶级政治服务的。它表现的尽是一些王公贵族和才子佳人，以及天鹅仙女之类的东西。近年来，苏联现代修正主义集团不但全盘继承了旧的芭蕾舞，而且还进一步演出了《四十一个》、《士兵和魔鬼的颂歌》等宣扬阶级调和、表现战争恐怖、鼓吹和平主义的剧目，为他们的修正主义政治路线服务。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”芭蕾舞艺术也必须为工农兵服务。但是过去在反革命修正主义文艺黑线的控制下，我国的芭蕾舞却完全照搬资产阶级和苏联现代修正主义那一套，大演什么《天鹅湖》、《海侠》、《吉赛尔》、《泪泉》、《巴黎圣母院》、《仙女们》，散发着资产阶级、修正主义的臭气，毒害和腐蚀我国人民，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。对于这种状况我们能够容忍下去吗？不能，一天也不能再容忍了。我们一定要进行芭蕾舞的革命。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却千方百计地阻止这场革命，胡说什么“反映现代生活不能勉强。芭蕾舞、外国歌剧不一定能反映”，又说什么“看《天鹅湖》可以提高兴致，《巴黎圣母院》的艺术水平也很高，也有教育作用。”一九六四年他还大肆叫嚣芭蕾舞不能改革，要洋到底，学到家。他的忠实走卒们也跟着诬蔑芭蕾舞改革“是用无产阶级政权强加于群众，结果是不中不西、非驴非马。”他们如此地反对和攻击芭蕾舞改革，就是要中国的芭蕾舞走资本主义和修正主义的道路。江青同志义正词严地驳斥了他们的反动谬论，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，把芭蕾舞这个外来的艺术形式彻底改造过来，“洋为中用”，使它变成为工农兵服务、具有中国作风和中国气派的艺术。江青同志说：芭蕾舞外国搞了几百年，现在西方的芭蕾都颓废了，走向没落了，芭蕾舞革命的红旗要由我们来扛了。江青同志鼓励我们要放眼世界，不只为少数人服务，要为全中国人民服务，要为亚非拉革命人民服务，要有雄心志气，相信我们一定能够走出自己的道路。
    芭蕾舞革命的第一步，第一个剧目的成败，具有重大的意义；而选择什么题材又是剧目成败的关键之一。在选择剧本时，林默涵立即提出要排练宣扬资产阶级人情味的《达吉和她的父亲》，妄图把芭蕾舞革命引向歧途。在这个重要关头，江青同志紧紧掌握了革命的方向，毅然决定排练表现毛主席人民战争思想的《红色娘子军》，粉碎了他们的阴谋。
    但是，敌人决不甘心于他们的失败，他们又以新的方式来破坏和捣乱《红色娘子军》的排练。他们一方面阳奉阴违，消极对抗，到处散布失败的论调，说什么“排革命戏总有一个矫枉必须过正的过程，古典剧目将来还是要演出的，你们不能丢。”同时，他们又玩弄釜底抽薪的手法，以到香港演出为名，抽调一批主要演员去继续排练《天鹅湖》，企图搞垮《红色娘子军》的排练。这一诡计，当时就受到了周总理的严厉批评和剧团革命群众的抵制，又未能得逞。但他们还不死心。当《红色娘子军》初步排成后，周扬一伙又马上跳出来，大泼冷水，死样怪气地说：“看不懂，不清楚。艺术水平太低，太乱，不能见外国人，外国人不会承认的”等等。在这个重要关头，又是江青同志支持了我们。她在看完彩排的第二天，就亲自到剧团来和我们谈话，充分肯定了《红色娘子军》这个舞剧的成就。江青同志说：这个戏要写好人民战争的主题，写出无产阶级的英雄群象，表现出在任何情况下红旗不倒的革命精神。她要求《红色娘子军》塑造出英雄人物的光辉形象，用毛泽东思想去教育广大观众。
    我们永远永远难忘的是一九六四年十月八日这一天，一轮红日照亮了芭蕾舞台，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席观看了《红色娘子军》的演出，对于这个刚刚诞生的新舞剧，毛主席给予了很高的评价，他老人家说：“方向是对头的，革命是成功的，艺术上也是好的。”毛主席的指示，是对《红色娘子军》，也是对整个芭蕾舞革命的最大关怀、最大鼓舞和最大支持，是对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵之流的最有力的打击。令人气愤的是，在毛主席观看演出后的第二天早晨，林默涵就急急忙忙跑到剧团，他严密封锁毛主席对《红色娘子军》的评价，却恶毒地诬蔑：“京剧革命戏是穿开裆裤的小孩，而《红色娘子军》只能说是象一个襁褓中吃奶的婴儿”，还说什么“丑媳妇总是要见婆娘的”等等，企图抵消我们伟大领袖毛主席观看演出的巨大政治影响。但是，毛主席的声音是封锁不住的，革命的潮流是不可阻挡的。毛主席的教导给我们指明了前进的方向。中国第一个革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》终于冲破了重重阻挠和困难，成功地诞生了，它以耀眼的光辉屹立在社会主义文艺舞台上！
                             二　
    毛主席教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”整个艺术舞台的历史都证明了这一点。资产阶级的芭蕾舞所歌颂的都是资产阶级的代表人物，即使有时也描写劳动人民，但形象都是被歪曲和丑化了的。无产阶级的芭蕾舞必须歌颂无产阶级的代表人物，大演特演工农兵英雄人物的形象。
    围绕着《红色娘子军》的人物塑造，也经历了一场斗争。主要集中在这样两个问题上：如何正确塑造吴清华、洪常青、连长等正面人物形象；如何正确处理正面人物和反面人物的关系。江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，驳斥了反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙不写英雄人物，而专写中间人物，不突出正面人物而着力刻划反面人物的种种谬论，明确地提出要通过舞台上的一切手段来树立英雄人物，而且要树立得高大、完美，绝不允许有任何一个细节损害英雄形象。反面人物也要塑造，但一定要使正面人物压过他们。
    吴清华是旧社会受苦的劳动人民，是从自发反抗走向自觉斗争的一个典型形象。在舞剧中应该表现出她的反抗斗争和她在党的领导下成长的过程，可是我们剧团内走资本主义道路的当权派，却要演员以修正主义的芭蕾舞剧《泪泉》中封建王后扎丽玛的调子来创造吴清华的形象。他们还妄图运用资产阶级芭蕾舞的情调，把舞剧中原有的红莲这个人物，搞得轻飘飘、软绵绵的，象仙女下凡似的。江青同志及时识破了他们的阴谋诡计，坚决砍去了红莲这个人物，并亲自帮助我们一次又一次地分析吴清华、洪常青、连长等人物的思想感情，研究舞蹈设计，指出在哪些关键的地方应该着重描写。洪常青更是一个光彩闪闪的无产阶级英雄人物，江青同志再三强调一定要表现出他的英雄气概，特别是英勇就义那场舞蹈，要表现出他大义凛然、宁死不屈的革命精神。
    江青同志还要求把革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式高度统一起来，精益求精，不断加工提高。她对人物的化装、服饰、道具都提出了严格的要求。例如为了突出正面人物的形象，红军的衣服不能有一点点脏，红领章和红五角星都要加金边。舞蹈造型、音乐造型都要为突出英雄人物服务。江青同志的强烈的无产阶级感情和严肃认真、一丝不苟的工作态度，激励着我们努力去创造工农兵的形象，为无产阶级新文艺冲锋陷阵。
                           三　
    通过《红色娘子军》的排练和演出，我们深深地体会到塑造不塑造无产阶级的英雄人物，是一个立场问题；能不能塑造好无产阶级的英雄人物，是一个阶级感情问题。而这两个问题的解决，关键又在于文艺工作者的思想革命化。要演革命戏，先做革命人。否则，就会象毛主席批评的那样：“倘若描写，也是衣服是劳动人民，面孔却是小资产阶级知识分子。”
    长期以来，我们芭蕾舞剧团在修正主义文艺黑线的控制下，完全迷恋于“大、洋、古”的剧目中，严重地脱离现实斗争生活，脱离工农兵群众。当时剧团内走资本主义道路的当权派是不准许我们深入工厂、农村、部队生活的。有个演员要求下去深入生活，竟然受到讥笑，他们说什么“下次宴会你第一个去吧。”林默涵也说过“不用深入生活了，看几部电影，学习一下就可以啦。”江青同志针对这种情况，及时地给我们敲起了警钟，要我们很好地学习毛主席著作，突出政治思想教育。为了《红色娘子军》的创作，江青同志不仅自己千里迢迢特意去海南岛，到当年娘子军活动过的地方进行系统周密的调查，而且也组织我们到海南岛去深入生活，到连队去当兵，到工厂里去劳动。我们在现实生活斗争当中，在和工农兵交往的过程中，受到了深刻的教育。工人阶级大公无私的崇高品质，解放军活学活用毛主席著作、坚持四个第一和三八作风的精神，都促进着我们的思想革命化。工农兵，只有工农兵才是世界上最高尚的人，我们能不歌颂他们而歌颂资产阶级吗？我们能不为他们服务而为资产阶级服务吗？不能，坚决不能。我们一定要为工农兵服务，让工农兵形象永远永远地树立在芭蕾舞台上。
    在深入生活的过程中，我们更进一步体会到毛主席的教导：一定要把自己的立足点“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺”。只有遵照毛主席的教导去做，芭蕾舞的革命才不会半途而废。也只有这样，我们才能够比较好地去创造《红色娘子军》中的英雄形象。例如扮演吴清华的演员，开始时演来演去，舞台上的娘子军还是“娘子”，根本不象个“军”。深入生活以后，使她受了很深的教育。特别是海南岛有一位老妈妈的经历更加深了她对吴清华这个人物的体会。这位老妈妈七岁时就卖给地主，十年中逃跑过八次，每次被地主抓回去后都遭捆打，还吊在火盆上用烈火烤，但是这位老妈妈从来没有在地主面前流过一滴眼泪，最后终于逃出了虎口。老妈妈的强烈反抗精神，正是吴清华应有的坚强性格。这位演员经过了一段生活的锻炼，再扮演吴清华时就有了依据，人物形象也开始丰满起来了。其他同志在塑造工农兵形象时，阶级感情也都有了加强。当然，这仅仅是个开始，我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，长期地深入工农兵，进行脱胎换骨的改造，把立足点真正移到工农兵这方面来。
                      ＊　＊
    革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的诞生，是革命的文艺工作者在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，在江青同志的亲自领导下，造了资产阶级芭蕾舞艺术的反，造了修正主义芭蕾舞艺术的反，为世界革命文艺树立样板的一次伟大革命。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》以及《白毛女》的诞生，向全世界宣告：芭蕾舞从此得到新生了，为资产阶级服务、毒害人民的旧芭蕾舞在中国已经一去不复返了。我国的芭蕾舞以崭新的姿态，豪迈的步伐，走在无产阶级革命文艺的大军中。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀下，革命的芭蕾以其无限的生命力，开创了世界芭蕾艺术的新纪元；它必将出现更加灿烂的前景，更好地为工农兵、为无产阶级政治服务！（附图片）
