Guiding the summer harvest with Mao Zedong Thought ensures a swift and successful harvest. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces. This was our deepest impression after visiting the Car Village Production Brigade in Changrong Commune, Pinglu County, Shanxi Province.

When we arrived for our visit, nearly all of the 2,700-plus mu of wheat fields in the entire brigade had been neatly harvested. The villagers had begun to clear the stubble and replant. Nearly half of the late autumn crops had already been sown. The threshed wheat straw was piled up like small hills, and more than half of the wheat had been stored. This year, the brigade achieved a bumper summer harvest, with the harvest time shortened by about ten days compared to previous years, and the quality of the harvest was also better than before.

Why was this year's summer harvest so swift and successful? The villagers and cadres excitedly said that it was because we guided the summer harvest with Mao Zedong Thought, further implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." Using the great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party as a driving force, we pushed forward the summer harvest.

The vast wheat fields served both as the battlefield for the summer harvest and as a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The villagers carried red flags, held sickles, and carried the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," rushing to the fields. The sounds of reciting "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and singing revolutionary songs echoed across the fields.

Lü Yingwen, the brigade leader of the Fifth Team, is a new cadre selected by the masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This young Communist Party member prioritized organizing the villagers to study Chairman Mao's works. Once, he led everyone to study two quotations from Chairman Mao:

"To 'grasp firmly' means that the Party committee must not only 'grasp' the main tasks but must also 'grasp firmly.' Only by grasping something very tightly, without letting go, can it be grasped. If you grasp something but not firmly, it is as if you are not grasping it at all."

"To promote the spirit of daring to fight, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and of continuous struggle (that is, fighting several battles in quick succession without rest in a short period)."

During the discussion, two old poor and lower-middle peasants, Li Gaosheng and Yuan Fusheng, said: Chairman Mao's words hit the mark. Right now, we are both harvesting wheat and sowing seeds. People often say, "Morning and afternoon are like half a year apart." We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and hurry with the sowing. Everyone agreed with their opinion. That night, more than forty core militiamen formed a shock team, pulling wheat and fertilizing at the same time. The next morning, they had sown twelve mu of corn. These two old villagers also participated in the battle with the young people.

"The Three Articles" are the motto of the villagers in Car Village. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, eliminate selfishness, and always strive to transform themselves into new people who love the collective and work selflessly. One day, while the villagers were harvesting wheat, suddenly there was thunder and a heavy downpour. Everyone quickly rushed into the caves to avoid the rain. The study group leader took advantage of this break to organize everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Young villager Duan Sixin said: Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's selfless spirit, dedicated to the work with utmost responsibility. The wheat we harvest, if not quickly stood up, will sprout and rot when rained on, causing losses to the state and the collective. Upon hearing this, the villagers immediately rushed out into the rain, stood up all the wheat sheaves in the more than thirty mu of wheat fields that had just been harvested, and picked up every single wheat head scattered on the ground. Although they were all soaked, they felt an indescribable joy in their hearts.

In the fields, at the edges of the fields, and on the threshing grounds of Car Village, you could hear the voices of angry denunciation and criticism of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. Before the wheat harvest, Car Village held several mass meetings, combining local struggle, criticism, and transformation, to launch a great indictment, exposure, criticism, and struggle against the top capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly eliminating his poison in rural areas. After the summer harvest began, they held small-scale criticism meetings in the fields, at the edges of the fields, and on the threshing grounds during rest times, to denounce and expose the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. Brigade Poor Peasants' Association Chairman Wu Xiangzhao recounted his twenty-plus years of miserable experiences as a long-term worker for a landlord, criticizing the top capitalist-roader's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." He said, if it were not for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's wise leadership, how could we poor and lower-middle peasants have the happy life we have today? We must follow Chairman Mao for life. While criticizing the crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, the villagers also combined criticizing the serious consequences caused by the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the local Party who promoted material incentives and the work-point system. Young villager Ru Jiangjun, who had once been harmed by the work-point system, angrily said: "The work-point system, the more it is promoted, the worse it gets, making people selfish, picking the easy jobs, harming both individuals and the collective. We must resolutely not take the road of capitalist restoration." Ru Jiangjun raised his class consciousness through the revolutionary criticism and worked hard during the wheat harvest, getting up early and working late. The masses praised him on the blackboard newspaper.

The revolutionary criticism further ignited the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, further solidifying their resolve to follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist road forever. Here, you can see everywhere the new style of caring for and loving the collective, with good deeds emerging one after another. This year, the number of laborers participating in the wheat harvest was more than in any previous year. Many elderly women and children also voluntarily carried bamboo baskets to pick up wheat heads for the collective, contributing their efforts to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary, achieving a bumper harvest.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Car Village, in the joyous days of the summer bumper harvest, never forgot class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, seriously doing the summer harvest protection work, and not allowing the class enemies to cause any trouble. Since the summer harvest, no accidents have occurred in the entire brigade.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Car Village believe that doing a good job in the summer harvest is not only an economic battle but also a political battle. It is related to implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people" and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed that they must do a good job in this year's summer harvest, achieving new victories in both revolution and production to give the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face, supporting the patriotic struggle of Hong Kong compatriots, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the Arab people and the oppressed people of the world.

    用毛泽东思想统帅夏收
    ——山西平陆县车村大队夏收见闻
    用毛泽东思想统帅夏收，夏收就会又快又好。无产阶级文化大革命是生产力发展的强大推动力。这是我们访问山西省平陆县常荣公社车村大队时留下的最深刻的印象。
    当我们来这里访问的时候，在全大队两千七百多亩麦田里，绝大部分地块已经收割得干干净净。社员们开始灭茬、复播。将近一半的晚秋作物已经播完。碾过的麦秸堆得象小山一样，入库的小麦已有一半以上。这个大队今年获得了夏季大丰收，麦收速度比往年缩短十天左右，收打质量也比往年好。
    今年的夏收为什么又快又好？社员和干部们兴奋地说，这是我们以毛泽东思想统帅夏收，进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争为动力，推动夏收的结果。
    广阔的麦田，既是夏收的战场，又是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。社员们肩扛红旗，手持镰刀，捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，奔赴田间。朗读《毛主席语录》和高唱革命歌曲的声音，此起彼伏，响彻田野。
    五队队长吕应文，是无产阶级文化大革命中由群众新选的干部。这个年轻的共产党员，把组织社员学习毛主席著作放在首位。有一次，他领着大家学习了两条毛主席语录：
    “要‘抓紧’。就是说，党委对主要工作不但一定要‘抓’，而且一定要‘抓紧’。什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”
    “发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”
    在讨论中，两位贫下中农老社员李高升和员福胜说：毛主席的话说在咱们的心坎上。眼下又是割麦，又是下种，人常说，“早上下午差半年”，咱们一定要听毛主席的话，抓紧下种。大伙同意他俩的意见，当天夜里由四十多个基干民兵组成突击队，一边拉麦，一边施肥，第二天清早，就种了十二亩玉米。这两位老社员也和小伙子们一起参加了战斗。
    “老三篇”是车村大队社员们的座右铭。他们按照毛主席的教导，破私立公，时刻注意把自己改造成为热爱集体、一心为公的共产主义新人。有一天，社员们正在割麦，突然雷声隆隆，下起倾盆大雨。大家急忙进窑洞避雨。学习毛主席著作辅导员就利用这个空隙，组织大家学习了《纪念白求恩》。青年社员段四新说：毛主席教导我们要学习白求恩同志毫不利己、专门利人，对工作极端负责任的精神。咱们割的麦子，放在地上，要不赶快立起来，雨淋了就会发芽、霉烂，给国家和集体带来损失。社员们一听，立即冒着大雨，跑到地里，把刚刚割倒的三十多亩麦地的麦捆都立了起来，还把撒在地上的麦穗拾得一干二净。他们虽然个个湿透了衣裳，但心里有说不出的高兴。
    在车村的田间、地头、打麦场上，处处可以听到愤怒声讨和批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的声音。在麦收前夕，车村大队一连开了几次群众大会，结合本地的斗批改，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派展开了大控诉、大揭发、大批判、大斗争，彻底肃清他在农村问题上的流毒。夏收开始以后，他们又在田间、地头、打麦场上，利用休息时间，召开小型批判会，控诉和声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。大队贫协主任吴香照讲述了他给地主当了二十多年长工的悲惨遭遇，批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派“剥削有功”的反动谬论。他说，要不是毛主席、共产党的英明领导，咱贫下中农那有今天的幸福生活。我们一定要紧紧跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。社员们在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪行时，还结合批判了当地党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的物质刺激、工分挂帅所造成的严重恶果。过去曾受过“工分挂帅”毒害的青年社员茹降均愤怒地说：“工分挂帅，越挂越坏，弄得人私心当头，干活挑肥拣瘦，害了个人，又害了集体。我们坚决不能走这条复辟资本主义的道路。”茹降均在革命的大批判中提高了阶级觉悟，在麦收中起早贪黑，干劲很足。群众在黑板报上表扬了他。
    革命的大批判，更加激发了贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的阶级感情，更加坚定了他们永远跟着毛主席走社会主义道路的决心。在这里，到处可以看到关心集体、热爱集体的共产主义新风尚，好人好事层出不穷。今年参加麦收的出勤劳力比以往任何一年都多，许多老大娘和少年儿童，也自动地手提竹篮，为集体拣麦穗，为保证颗粒还仓，丰产丰收，贡献了一份力量。
    车村大队贫下中农在喜庆夏季大丰收的日子里，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，认真做好夏收保卫工作，决不许阶级敌人乱说乱动。夏收以来，全大队没有发生过任何事故。
    车村大队广大贫下中农认为，搞好夏收，是一场经济仗，更是一场政治仗。它关系到贯彻执行毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大方针，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。他们表示，一定要搞好今年的夏收，以革命、生产双胜利的新战果给中国的赫鲁晓夫一记响亮的耳光，支持香港爱国同胞的抗英斗争，支持阿拉伯人民和世界被压迫人民的革命斗争。
