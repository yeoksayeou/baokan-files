At a time when the leaders of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are intensifying their global collusion in the United States, French President Charles de Gaulle issued a statement on June 21, advocating France's fake "neutrality" and big-power politics in the Middle East issue, while again criticizing the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

In his statement on June 21, de Gaulle continued to play the fake "neutrality" card. He openly accused the Arab countries, which are suffering from aggression, of "threatening to destroy Israel" and obstructing Israel's navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba. He advocated for Israel to "be able to survive." At the same time, he also criticized Israel for "initiating hostile actions," stating that France does not consider any changes achieved by Israel through military actions to be final.

De Gaulle, in his statement, did not distinguish between the aggressors and the victims, vaguely expressing that "France opposes the Middle East war." He advocated for the "four great powers to consult together to oppose the use of force," intending to join the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union in dominating the fate of Arab countries. France's purpose in doing so is to use the opportunity of the Middle East war to restore and expand its influence in the region. In reality, it stands on the side of the U.S.-Israel aggressors.

De Gaulle also discussed the Vietnam issue in his statement. He attacked the U.S.'s Vietnam policy, accusing the U.S. of interfering in Vietnam. He believed that the resolution of the Middle East issue must be linked with the Vietnam issue.

De Gaulle's statement attracted the attention of many Western news agencies. The Associated Press of the United States believed that de Gaulle chose this moment to issue his statement because he "heard the news that Khrushchev might meet with U.S. President Johnson." He was worried that the U.S. and the Soviet Union might reach an agreement to "redraw the world's spheres of influence."

    戴高乐担心美苏合谋瓜分“势力范围”
    鼓吹大国干涉阿拉伯国家
    据新华社巴黎二十一日电　在美帝和苏修的头目正在美国加紧全球性大勾结的时候，法国总统戴高乐二十一日发表声明，鼓吹法国在中东问题上假“中立”和想搞“大国”强权政治的立场，同时再次指责美国侵略越南。
    戴高乐在二十一日的声明中继续玩弄假“中立”，他公然指责遭受侵略的阿拉伯国家“威胁要摧毁以色列”和妨碍以色列在亚喀巴湾通航，并鼓吹让以色列“能够生存”；同时，他也指责了以色列“发起敌对行动”，表示法国不认为以色列“在军事行动基础上实现的任何变化是最终的”。
    戴高乐在声明中不分侵略者和被侵略者，笼统地表示“法国反对中东战争”，鼓吹“四大国商议共同反对武力”，以便同美英苏一起来主宰阿拉伯国家的命运。法国这样做的目的，是想利用这次中东战争的时机，恢复和扩大法国在中东地区的影响，它实际上是站在美以侵略者一边的。
    戴高乐在声明中还谈到了越南问题，他攻击了美国的越南政策，指责美国干涉越南。他认为中东问题的解决必须同越南问题联系在一起。
    戴高乐的声明引起了许多西方通讯社的注意。美国合众国际社认为戴高乐选择目前时机发表声明，是因为“听到了柯西金可能同美国总统约翰逊会谈的消息”，他担心美苏可能达成“重新瓜分世界势力范围”的协议。
