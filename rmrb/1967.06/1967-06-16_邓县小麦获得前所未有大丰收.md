Deng County, one of the major grain-producing areas in Henan Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest. The 1.5 million mu of wheat in the county have yielded a record harvest. According to the actual threshing results, the yield per unit area in many communes and production teams has doubled compared to normal years. The total wheat production in the county has increased by 30% compared to last year. The commune members are filled with joy over the harvest and enthusiastically acclaim it as a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great harvest brought by Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary masses and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Deng County are not satisfied with the current achievements. They unanimously expressed that in the future, they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the revolution, promote production, plant and manage the late autumn crops in a timely manner, and ensure a greater harvest in the autumn.

    邓县小麦获得前所未有大丰收
    河南省重要商品粮基地之一邓县的一百五十万亩小麦，获得了前所未有的大丰收。从实打情况看，许多社、队的单位面积产量比正常年景增加了一倍，全县小麦总产量比去年增产百分之三十。社员们满怀着丰收的喜悦，热烈欢呼这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，这是毛泽东思想带来的大丰收。
    邓县无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农不满足于已有的成绩，大家一致表示，今后一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，适时地种足种好晚秋，管好大秋，争取秋季更大的丰收。
