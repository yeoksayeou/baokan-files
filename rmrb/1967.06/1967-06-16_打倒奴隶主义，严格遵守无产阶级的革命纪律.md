Revolution, struggle, criticism—this is the essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Every revolutionary must have a revolutionary fighting spirit and a fearless, unyielding attitude towards the proletarian revolutionary cause. Slavery ideology, however, demands that people bow and scrape before the exploiting class, endure humiliation, and obey absolutely without any doubt.

The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to push their counter-revolutionary revisionist political line, have brought the most reactionary slavery ideology into the Party, attempting to stifle the revolutionary spirit of Party members and turn them into docile tools for opposing the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. In his toxic weed "Cultivation" and other speeches, he elevates slavery ideology as a code of conduct, as the standard for "Party nature cultivation" for Communist Party members. He says:

"We advocate absolute organizational obedience. All conditional obedience is wrong; it should be unconditional and absolute obedience, with 'the upper echelons and the majority being correct in principle and politics' as the condition for obedience is wrong. 'Even if the majority and the upper echelons or the Central Committee are wrong, you still have to obey'; the principle of democratic centralism stipulates that as long as the majority, the upper echelons, or the Central Committee have passed and decided, you must obey, even if it is wrong, you must obey."

This is unadulterated slavery ideology!

Chairman Mao has long criticized slavery ideology. Soon after "Cultivation" was published, Chairman Mao pointed out in his brilliant work "Rectifying the Party's Style": "Communist Party members must question everything, think it over carefully, and see if it is in line with reality and if it makes sense. They must not blindly follow and must not advocate slavery ideology." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party threw out the bourgeois reactionary line, brutally suppressed the masses, and demanded that the proletarian revolutionary faction obey his counter-revolutionary revisionist leadership unconditionally, Chairman Mao pointed out in stark contrast: "Against all erroneous leadership that harms the revolution, one should not accept it unconditionally, but should resolutely resist."

Dialectical materialism tells us: the unity of contradictions is conditional, while the struggle of contradictions is absolute. Similarly, the unity, solidarity, and obedience of the proletarian party are conditional, while internal struggle is absolute and unconditional.

Marxism-Leninism has always held that organizational obedience must be based on political and principled correctness. The organizational line of the proletariat must serve the political line.

When talking about adhering to the organizational principle of democratic centralism, Chairman Mao first points out that the Party's leadership must have a correct guiding line.

Lenin also raised the issue in this way. What does the iron discipline of the proletariat rely on? Lenin answers: first, "the awareness of the vanguard of the proletariat, its loyalty to the revolution"; second, the vanguard's close ties "first and foremost with the working masses of the proletariat, but also with the non-proletarian working masses"; third, the political leadership of the vanguard is correct... and to make the broad masses also believe in its correctness based on their personal experience.

The highest principle of a Communist Party member is revolution. If a Party leader betrays the revolutionary principles of the proletariat, we must be "disorganized and undisciplined," rebel against him, and never "obey unconditionally"; sacrificing the Party's political principles to talk about organizational discipline is betrayal.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party stubbornly promotes slavery ideology. He self-proclaims himself as the Party's "leader," claiming "I am the Party." If anyone does not obey him "unconditionally," he brings out the law of the slave owner, beating them down, labeling them, and accusing them of being "disorganized and undisciplined," "disrupting democratic centralism," "resisting the will of the majority," "anti-Party," and so on, without end.

"Disrupting democratic centralism"? Our centralism is built on a broad democratic foundation. Without democracy, there can be no correct centralism. Centralism is the concentration of correct opinions. On the basis of concentrating correct opinions, one can achieve unity of thought and action. Erroneous centralism is a violation of democratic centralism. Opposing erroneous centralism is not opposing democratic centralism but is maintaining democratic centralism.

"Truth is on the side of the minority, and one must obey the opinion of the majority"? Absolutely not. Sacrificing truth, selling out principles, and surrendering to the erroneous "majority" is thorough opportunism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All words and deeds of Communist Party members must take the greatest benefit of the broadest masses of the people and their support as the highest standard." We must not abandon this highest standard to obey some "majority." A "majority" that goes against the greatest benefit of the broadest masses of the people is actually a minority, a handful.

Chairman Mao says: "In history, new and correct things often do not get the recognition of the majority at the beginning and can only develop in a tortuous way through struggle." When the truth is in the hands of a minority, then the minority who hold the truth should insist on the truth, fear no blows, and fight unyieldingly for the truth. Our great leader Chairman Mao is a shining example. When the opportunists Chen Duxiu, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and others used the so-called "majority" to attack him, Chairman Mao always insisted on the truth, insisted on his principled stance, and waged an uncompromising struggle against them. Lenin was the same. Stalin said: "Lenin never became a prisoner of the majority, especially when this majority had no principled stance. In the history of our Party, there have been times when the majority opinion of the Party or the immediate interests of the Party conflicted with the fundamental interests of the proletariat. In such circumstances, Lenin always unhesitatingly insisted on principles and opposed the majority opinion of the Party. And in such circumstances, he was not afraid to stand alone against everyone, because he believed—as he himself often said—that 'a policy of principle is the only correct policy.'"

"Anti-Party"? We love the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao. Against the "leader" who has betrayed the fundamental interests of the proletarian revolution, we must rebel against him, expose him resolutely, and make him lose his prestige and be overthrown. This is to defend the Party. Those who usurp the Party are the real anti-Party elements.

In his immortal work "Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," Lenin calls on German workers: "Abandon the Scheidemannites and Kautskyites, push aside these 'leaders,' free yourselves from their teaching that dulls and vulgarizes, against their wishes, without regard for them, bypassing them, and march towards revolution, make a revolution!" Lenin's words are so good! All proletarians of the world, rise up, resolutely abandon the modern Scheidemanns and Kautskys, kick out all the Khrushchev-style opportunist "leaders"!

In 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a great call to break superstitions, liberate thinking, and overthrow slavery ideology. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party openly opposed Chairman Mao, advocating the reactionary "docile tool" theory. He said, "In a slave society, the slave owner calls the slave a living tool." He also said that people are "living tools," and that Communist Party members should be like slaves, "docile tools." This is purely the viewpoint of a slave owner!

Slavery ideology is not the ideology of the slave class but the reactionary ideology used by the exploiting class to deceive and fool the exploited class. "Docility" is not the nature of the slave class. Where there is exploitation and oppression, there is resistance and struggle. This has been the case throughout history, both in China and abroad. The great slave uprising in ancient Rome eloquently proves that the slave class dares to rebel and dare to make a revolution. The heroic image of Spartacus, the leader of this uprising, has always inspired the fighting spirit of the exploited and oppressed people.

Lenin said: "A slave who is aware of his slave status and struggles against it is a revolutionary. A slave who is unaware of his slave status and lives a silent, confused slave life is a complete slave. A slave who praises the beautiful slave life and is grateful to the kind and benevolent master is a lackey, a scoundrel." Proletarian revolutionaries always enthusiastically praise the sky-high revolutionary spirit of the exploited class and encourage them to fight. The exploiting class, on the other hand, maliciously imposes "docility" on the exploited class and praises it as their "virtue." The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, so unremittingly promoting slavery ideology, shows that he completely stands on the reactionary stance of the exploiting class.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to peddle slavery ideology, even maliciously distorts the glorious history of our Party and viciously attacks our great leader Chairman Mao. In December 1957, when receiving a Party representative, he actually said: "Even during the period of Chen Duxiu's erroneous line, the entire Party was united under Chen Duxiu's line, and later united under the 'left' line... Our Party has always maintained unity and has not split, maintained Party discipline... that is, regardless of whether the Party's line is correct or erroneous, the Party has always maintained unity."

This is a complete lie!

The great Communist Party of China is the most militant and revolutionary proletarian party. Whether during the period of right-opportunist Chen Duxiu's rule or during the period of "left"-opportunist Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and others' rule, Chairman Mao always fought against their opportunist lines and resolutely resisted. It was precisely because of Chairman Mao's resolute struggle and resistance that the traitor Chen Duxiu was removed, the old revisionist line of Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and others was ended, and the correct leadership of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao was established. Our Party has grown and strengthened in the struggle between the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the "left" and right opportunist lines.

A party, if the revisionist line occupies the dominant position, then the proletarian revolutionaries should resolutely rebel, either overthrow the revisionist rule or establish a new Marxist-Leninist party, and never unite under the revisionist leadership. The revolutionary line of the proletariat and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie can only "devour" each other, they are irreconcilable and cannot unite.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to promote the reactionary slavery ideology, also openly slanders the great Lenin. He says that before the October Revolution, Lenin "had not broken with the Second International organizationally."

This is a blatant lie!

The "Zimmerwald Left Conference" held in 1915 was not a public organizational break with the opportunism of the Second International? Without the organizational break with the opportunism of the Second International, there would not have been the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution.

The lies written in ink cannot cover up the truth of history. The traitors of the proletariat, in their attempt to falsify history, only further expose their ugly faces.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party promotes slavery ideology, completely serving the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie. The "discipline" he talks about is the discipline of the bourgeoisie.

He often boasts about his so-called "achievements" in Anshan, but in fact, his greatest "achievement" is to instill the poison of slavery ideology into the workers and betray the fundamental interests of the working class. As a representative of the Anshan Workers' Club, he signed an agreement with the Anshan Mining Bureau stipulating: "The rules and regulations for workers established by the Mining Bureau must be observed by all workers and representatives in all places," and workers "must not gather and make noise to blackmail, and must not stop work to hinder work." Look, he blatantly promotes the cannibalistic discipline of the bourgeoisie, not allowing workers to revolt.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party regards the "organizational discipline" of the bourgeoisie as sacred; while for the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, he brazenly destroys it. He wants Party members to obey his erroneous leadership that harms the revolution "unconditionally," but he himself, towards the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the correct decisions of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, is disobedient and refuses to carry them out.

Soon after the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our great leader Chairman Mao put forward the principle of "independence within the united front," opposing class capitulationism. In August 1937, the Central Political Bureau's Luochuan Conference passed Chairman Mao's great strategic thought.

However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, this person who often talks about "cultivation of Party discipline," what attitude did he take towards Chairman Mao's great instructions and the decisions of the Party Central Committee? On February 5, 1938, he vigorously promoted class capitulationism, advocating that the guerrilla warfare in each region "must strategically implement the unified strategic will of the Central Military Commission (note: the Central he refers to is the Central of the Kuomintang), and in policy, must implement the unified anti-Japanese policy of the Central Government." All anti-Japanese armed forces in North China "must be unified under the direct command of the highest military command organs in the local, North China, and Central regions as much as possible." On July 10 of the same year, he wrote a letter to the head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Peng Zhen, about the capitulationist fallacy he had promoted at the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Party Representative Conference, not only expressing no disagreement but also instructing him to adapt to the needs of the warlord Yan Xishan and to speak in Yan Xishan's tone.

Before and after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our great leader Chairman Mao published the brilliant works "On the Coalition Government" and "The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: the policy of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie's political representative Chiang Kai-shek is to wage civil war. Against the Kuomintang reactionaries, we must "meet force with force, fight for every inch of land." Chairman Mao warned the entire Party and the entire army: "If there is opportunism in this period, it is to not strive for it and voluntarily hand over the fruits that the people should have to Chiang Kai-shek."

Chairman Mao's words, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party heard them, and when the Seventh National Congress of the Party passed Chairman Mao's political report "On the Coalition Government," he raised his hand. But what attitude did he take towards our great leader's words and the Party's decisions? On August 28, 1945, he instructed the "Liberation Daily" to publish an editorial, spreading illusions of peace, saying: "As long as one is not a madman or an idiot, regardless of which class or nation, in today's environment, one must demand peace."

On March 1, 1946, he made a report on the situation, asserting: "The instigators and warmongers of civil war have failed, and the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peace and parliamentary struggle." In the report, he vigorously promoted the so-called "six beliefs": "believe that civil war will stop"; "believe that the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek will not attack us"; "believe that the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek can carry out democratic reforms"; "believe that the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek can work with us to build a democratic country"; "believe that China is entering a new stage of peace and democracy"; and another belief, believe in the statement of the American imperialist leader "Truman." Based on this, he also proposed the so-called "three exchanges": exchange the army, "unify under the Ministry of Defense," "in exchange for national democratization"; exchange Party power, "in exchange for the legal status of our Party"; exchange the great fruits of victory won by the heroic struggle and bloodshed of the great Chinese people, in exchange for some people "to be officials, officials of the Central Government," in exchange for "twenty thousand US dollars borrowed from the United States."

This "report" is truly disgusting and stinky! Where is this a report on the situation? This is a thorough and complete betrayal!

The words he said, the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek had said many times. The American imperialists said to us: "You should listen to Hurley's words, send a few people to the Kuomintang government to be officials." Chiang Kai-shek said: "The Communist Party hands over the army, then it has a legal status." These "good words," Chairman Mao had already given a stern refutation. Chairman Mao said: "It's not good to be an official with tied hands and feet, we won't do it," "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people," "the people's weapons, a gun, a bullet, must be preserved, cannot be handed over."

It is clear that the "Party nature" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the Party nature of the Kuomintang, the Democratic Party of the United States; the discipline he absolutely obeys is the so-called "military and political orders" of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek.

His stance is so clear: towards Truman and Chiang Kai-shek, he is a complete slave, truly a tool with a slave mentality; while towards our great leader Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses, he is arrogant and stubborn, with an air of superiority. This is the class essence of the slavery ideology he advocates.

Examples need not be given.

In short, in every historical period, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has been like this, opposing the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, trampling on the Party's resolutions, and striving to maintain the discipline of the bourgeoisie, the discipline of revisionism.

Different classes have different organizational disciplines. A person can only obey the organizational discipline of their own class. The proposition of unconditionally obeying all organizational disciplines or opposing all organizational disciplines is extremely hypocritical and deceitful.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Unified discipline is a necessary condition for revolutionary victory." The fierce class struggle makes the proletariat understand that only strict organizational discipline can form a disciplined and united powerful force, ensure the implementation of the political line, concentrate the strength of the proletariat, aim at a common target of attack, and defeat powerful enemies. We oppose slavery ideology, not opposing obedience to the Party's organizational discipline, but on the contrary, it is to strengthen the revolutionary organizational discipline of the proletariat.

Towards the organizational discipline of the Communist Party of China led by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, towards the wise instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, we must resolutely carry them out and follow them to the letter. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth tested by revolutionary practice, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism of our time. Therefore, Chairman Mao's instructions, if understood, must be carried out; if not understood, must still be carried out. We must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. This is in the fundamental interests of the proletariat, this is our highest discipline.

The proletarian party must have its true and outstanding leader, and must establish the absolute revolutionary authority of the leader throughout the Party. Without this condition, the Party's discipline cannot become an iron discipline, and the Party's cause has no guarantee of victory. Lenin said, without a Party leader with "extremely high prestige," "the dictatorship of the proletariat, the 'unity of will' of the proletariat, will become an empty phrase." The Communist Party of China can have a great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman like Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness of the Chinese people, and the greatest happiness of the revolutionary people of the whole world.

Towards the leadership organs at all levels that implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must maintain their prestige and establish their authority. Towards their correct instructions and decisions, we should voluntarily obey and resolutely carry them out. If there are different opinions, they can be raised, but we must not use the attitude towards the organization and discipline of revisionism to deal with the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. Whether to obey the instructions and decisions of the leadership organs at all levels should be based on whether they conform to the revolutionary interests of the proletariat and Mao Zedong Thought, and not based on personal likes and dislikes: if it suits my taste, I will carry it out; if it doesn't, I won't. We must not treat the adherence to revolutionary organizational discipline as slavery ideology to oppose. Opposing all leadership, all authority, all organizations, all disciplines is the anarchist trend of thought, which must be resolutely criticized.

We must not use anarchism to oppose slavery ideology. Slavery ideology and anarchism, although they seem extremely opposite on the surface, are actually connected in essence. Both are the ideological system of the exploiting class, and in worldview, both are metaphysics and idealism. Slavery ideology advocates blind obedience and does not seek truth; anarchism advocates doubting everything, overthrowing everything, and regarding anarchism as absolute, also does not recognize truth and advocates blind obedience. We oppose both slavery ideology and anarchism; we more oppose using the anarchism of overthrowing all governments and opposing all organizational disciplines to replace slavery ideology. We must not go from one extreme to another.

The anarchism of doubting everything, overthrowing everything, and negating everything is the reactionary ideology thrown out by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. When they are in power, they promote slavery ideology and implement a policy of fooling the people to maintain their counter-revolutionary revisionist dictatorship. When they lose power, they throw out anarchism to create chaos and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, slavery ideology and anarchism are essentially the same, both are ideological weapons used to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and maintain the rule of revisionism.

At present, some people, while opposing slavery ideology, promote and practice anarchism. They regard themselves as the only absolute authority, and whatever does not conform to "me" is "bourgeois reactionary line," "the last stronghold of counter-revolutionary restoration," and must be completely overthrown. Here, I advise you, those who advocate overthrowing everything, if you persist, you will also be overthrown.

We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize slavery ideology and oppose anarchism. For everything, we must use our noses to smell it, neither blindly accepting nor blindly opposing. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Everything should be thought over carefully with one's brain," "get rid of the heavy blindness in our Party," "learn to analyze things and cultivate the habit of analysis." Everything must be tested by revolutionary practice and examined by Mao Zedong Thought.

Consciously adhering to revolutionary discipline is a revolutionary need.

On the eve of the victory of the War of Liberation, Chairman Mao pointed out to the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country: "We must resolutely overcome the state of undisciplined or anarchic conditions that exist in many places, that is, arbitrarily changing the policies and strategies of the Central Committee or the higher Party committees, implementing extremely harmful policies and strategies that they think are correct but violate the unified will and unified discipline; under the pretext of busy work, adopting the wrong attitude of not reporting before and after the fact, treating the place they manage as if it were an independent country. This state of affairs causes great harm to revolutionary interests. Party committees at all levels must discuss this repeatedly and seriously overcome this state of undisciplined or anarchic conditions, and concentrate all possible and necessary power in the Central Committee and the representative organs of the Central Committee." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely oppose anarchism, and fight against all extremely harmful behaviors that violate the unified will and unified discipline of the Party.

Today, for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must, like the great People's Liberation Army, have a high degree of political awareness and iron discipline, greatly enhance our organizational discipline, resolutely carry out the policies and guidelines of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and not allow any phenomenon of violating discipline to occur.

    打倒奴隶主义，严格遵守无产阶级的革命纪律
    林杰
    一
    革命，斗争，批判，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质。每个革命者，对于无产阶级革命事业，必须具有革命的战斗风格和一往无前的大无畏精神。奴隶主义，却要人们向剥削阶级老爷卑躬屈膝，逆来顺受，只能绝对服从，不能丝毫怀疑。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了推行他的反革命修正主义的政治路线，把反动透顶的奴隶主义搬到党内来，妄图扼杀党员的革命精神，把党员变成他反对无产阶级革命、反对无产阶级专政的驯服工具。他在大毒草《修养》和其他言论中，把奴隶主义奉为法典，当作共产党员“党性修养”的准则。他说：
    “我们主张组织上的绝对服从。”“所有一切附有条件的服从都是不对的，应该是无条件的、绝对的服从”，以“上级和多数在原则上、政治上先要正确”“为服从的条件”“是不对的”。　　“即使大多数和上级或中央真错了，你也还要服从”；“民主集中制的原则规定，只要是大多数，是上级或中央通过和决定了的，就要服从，就是不对也要服从”。
    这是不折不扣的奴隶主义！
    毛主席早就对奴隶主义作了深刻的批判。《修养》发表不久，毛主席即在《整顿党的作风》这篇光辉的著作中指出：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，当党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派抛出资产阶级反动路线，残酷镇压群众，要无产阶级革命派绝对服从他的反革命修正主义的领导时，毛主席更针锋相对地指出：“对一切危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”
    唯物辩证法告诉我们：矛盾的统一性是有条件的，矛盾的斗争性是绝对的。同样，无产阶级政党的统一、团结、服从，都是有条件的，只有党内斗争才是绝对的，无条件的。
    马克思列宁主义从来认为，组织上的服从，必须以政治上、原则上的正确为先决条件。无产阶级的组织路线，必须服从政治路线。
    毛主席在谈到遵守民主集中制的组织原则时，首先指出，党的领导“要有正确的指导路线”。
    列宁也正是这样提出问题的。无产阶级的铁的纪律依靠什么来维持的呢？列宁回答说：第一，“依靠无产阶级先锋队的觉悟，它对革命的忠诚”；第二，依靠先锋队“首先是与无产者劳动群众，但同样也与非无产者劳动群众密切联系”；第三，依靠“先锋队的政治领导正确……而且要使广大群众根据切身经验也确信其正确”①。
    共产党员的最高原则是革命。如果某一个党的领导人背叛了无产阶级的革命原则，我们就是要“无组织，无纪律”，造他的反，决不能“无条件的绝对服从”；牺牲党的政治原则，而侈谈什么组织纪律，那就是背叛。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，顽固地推行奴隶主义。他自封为党的“领袖”，“朕即党”。谁如果对他不是“无条件的绝对服从”，他就搬出奴隶主的王法来，打棍子，戴帽子，什么“无组织，无纪律”，什么“破坏民主集中制”，“反抗多数意志”，“反党”，等等，不一而足。
    “破坏民主集中制”吗？我们的集中制是建立在广泛民主基础上的集中制。没有民主，不可能有正确的集中。集中，就是集中正确的意见。在集中正确意见的基础上，才能做到统一思想、统一行动。错误的集中，是违反民主集中制的。反对错误的集中，绝不是反对民主集中制，而正是维护民主集中制。
    “真理在少数人方面，也要服从大多数人的意见”吗？绝对不能。牺牲真理，出卖原则，向错误的“多数”投降，这是彻头彻尾的机会主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”我们决不能抛弃这个最高标准而去服从什么“多数”。违背最广大人民群众的最大利益的“多数”，实际上是少数，是一小撮。
    毛主席说：“历史上新的正确的东西，在开始的时候常常得不到多数人承认，只能在斗争中曲折地发展。”当真理在少数人手里时，那么，掌握真理的少数人就应该坚持真理，不怕打击，为真理而不屈不挠地斗争。我们的伟大领袖毛主席就是光辉的榜样。当机会主义者陈独秀、李立三、王明等人，利用所谓的“多数”打击他的时候，毛主席始终坚持真理，坚持原则立场，同他们进行了不调和的斗争。列宁也是这样。斯大林说：“列宁从来没有做过多数的俘虏，尤其是当这个多数没有原则立场的时候。在我们党的历史上有过党内多数的意见或党的眼前利益同无产阶级的根本利益相抵触的时候。在这种情况下，列宁总是毫不犹豫地坚持原则，反对党内多数的意见。而且在这种情况下，他简直不怕独自一人去反对全体，因为他认为——正如他自己常说的那样——‘原则性的政策是唯一正确的政策’。”②
    “反党”吗？以伟大领袖毛主席为首的伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，我们是无比热爱的。对于叛卖了无产阶级革命的根本利益的变节“领袖”，我们就是要造他们的反，就是要坚决揭露，使他们威风扫地，把他们打倒。这正是为了保卫党。那些篡党的家伙们，才是不折不扣的反党分子。
    列宁在《无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基》这一不朽著作中，号召德国工人说：“抛弃谢德曼分子和考茨基分子，推开这些‘领袖’，摆脱他们那种使人愚钝、使人庸俗的说教，违背他们的愿望，不理会他们，越过他们，而走向革命，进行革命！”③列宁这段话说得多好呵！全世界无产阶级，奋发起来，坚决抛弃现代的谢德曼和考茨基，踢开一切赫鲁晓夫式的机会主义“领袖”！
    二
    一九五八年，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出破除迷信，解放思想，打倒奴隶主义的伟大号召。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，公然对抗毛主席，宣扬反动的“驯服工具”论。他说，“在奴隶社会，奴隶主叫奴隶是活工具”。他还说人都是“活工具”，要共产党员做象奴隶那样的“驯服的工具”。这纯粹是奴隶主的观点！
    奴隶主义不是奴隶阶级的思想，而是剥削阶级用来欺骗、愚弄被剥削阶级的反动思想。“驯服”决不是奴隶阶级的本性。那里有剥削和压迫，那里就有反抗和斗争。古今中外，都是如此。古代罗马帝国的奴隶大起义，雄辩地证明，奴隶阶级是敢于造反，敢于革命的。这次大起义的领袖斯巴达克的英雄形象，一直在鼓舞着被剥削、被压迫人民的战斗。
    列宁说过：“意识到自己的奴隶地位而与之作斗争的奴隶，是革命家。不意识到自己的奴隶地位而过着默默无言、浑浑噩噩的奴隶生活的奴隶，是十足的奴隶。津津乐道地赞赏美妙的奴隶生活并对和善的好心的主人感激不尽的奴隶是奴才，是无耻之徒。”④无产阶级革命家，总是满腔热情地赞扬被剥削阶级的冲天革命精神，鼓励他们起来战斗。而剥削阶级总是别有用心地把“驯服”强加在被剥削阶级身上，并当作他们的“美德”加以宣扬。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，如此不遗余力地宣扬奴隶主义，这表明，他完完全全站在剥削阶级的反动立场上。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了贩卖奴隶主义，甚至肆意歪曲我们党的光荣历史，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席。一九五七年十二月，他在接见某党代表时，竟说：“即使在陈独秀的错误路线时期，我们全党亦统一在陈独秀的路线下，以后统一在‘左’倾路线之下，……我们党无论何时都保持党的统一不分裂，保持党的纪律，……就是说无论党的路线正确或错误，党都保持统一。”
    这完全是撒谎！
    伟大的中国共产党，是斗争性最强、最革命的无产阶级政党。不论在右倾机会主义者陈独秀统治时期，还是在“左”倾机会主义者李立三、王明等统治时期，毛主席对他们的机会主义路线始终坚持了斗争，坚决进行抵制。正是由于毛主席的坚决斗争和抵制，才清除了叛徒陈独秀，结束了李立三、王明等老牌反革命修正主义路线的统治，确立了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的正确领导。我们党就是在以毛主席为代表的革命路线同“左”右倾机会主义路线的斗争中发展壮大起来的。
    一个党，如果修正主义路线占了统治地位，那么，无产阶级革命派就应该坚决起来造反，或者推翻修正主义的统治，或者建立新的马克思列宁主义的党，决不能统一在修正主义领导之下。无产阶级的革命路线同资产阶级的反动路线，只能一方“吃掉”一方，是不可调和的，不能统一的。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了宣扬反动的奴隶主义，还公然污蔑伟大的列宁。他说什么，列宁在十月革命以前，“组织上并没有同第二国际决裂”。
    这是睁眼说瞎话！
    一九一五年召开的“齐美尔瓦尔德左派会议”，难道不是同第二国际的机会主义在组织上的公开决裂吗？没有同第二国际机会主义的决裂，就根本不会有十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利。
    墨写的谎言，掩盖不了历史的真实。无产阶级的叛徒，千方百计地企图篡改历史，只能进一步暴露他们的丑恶面目。

    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派宣扬奴隶主义，完全是为资产阶级反动统治服务的。他所说的“纪律”，就是资产阶级的纪律。
    他不是经常大肆吹嘘自己在安源的所谓“功绩”吗？其实，他的最大“功绩”就是向工人灌输奴隶主义的毒素，出卖工人阶级的根本利益。他以安源工人俱乐部代表的身份与安源矿务局签订的协定规定：“矿局所订工人通守规则，无论何处工人及代表，皆应共同遵守”，工人“不得动辄聚众喧扰要挟，并不得动辄罢工妨碍工作”。你看，他竟这样赤裸裸地宣扬资产阶级的吃人纪律，不准工人革命。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，对于资产阶级的“组织纪律”，视若神明；而对于无产阶级的革命纪律，则肆无忌惮地加以破坏。他要党员对他的危害革命的错误领导“无条件的绝对服从”，但是，他自己对我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，对于以毛主席为首的党中央的正确决定，却阳奉阴违，拒不执行。
    抗日战争开始不久，我们伟大领袖毛主席就提出“统一战线中的独立自主”原则，反对阶级投降主义。一九三七年八月中央政治局洛川会议，通过了毛主席的这个伟大战略思想。
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，这个大谈党的组织纪律“修养”的人，对毛主席的伟大指示和党中央的决定，究竟采取什么态度呢？一九三八年二月五日，他大肆鼓吹阶级投降主义，主张各个地区的游击战“在战略上必须实行中央军事委员会（按：他所说的中央都是指国民党的中央）统一的战略意旨，在政策上必须实行中央政府统一的抗日政策”，华北的一切抗日武装“必须尽可能的统一在当地的、华北的以及中央的最高军事指挥机关的直接指挥之下”。同年七月十日，他写信给旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的头子彭真，对他当时在晋察冀边区党代表大会上宣扬的“一切经过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”这个投降主义谬论，不仅没有表示任何不同意见，反而指示他要适应大军阀阎锡山的需要，要用阎锡山的腔调来说话。
    抗日战争胜利前后，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《论联合政府》、《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》等天才著作。毛主席明确地指出：大地主大资产阶级的政治代表蒋介石的方针是打内战。对于国民党反动派，必须“针锋相对，寸土必争”。毛主席告诫全党、全军：“这个时期如果有机会主义的话，那就是不力争，自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石。”
    毛主席说的话，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是听了的，党的全国第七次代表大会通过毛主席的政治报告《论联合政府》时，他是举了手的。但是对我们伟大领袖的话，对于党的决定，他又是采取什么态度呢？
    一九四五年八月二十八日，他授意《解放日报》发表社论，散布和平幻想，说什么：“只要不是疯子，不是白痴，不管他是那一个阶级，那一个民族，在今天这种环境之下，一定会要求和平”。
    一九四六年三月一日，他又作了一个时局问题的报告，断言：“内战挑拨者和主战派已失败，中国革命主要斗争形势已变为和平的、议会的”。在报告中，他大肆鼓吹所谓“六相信”：“相信内战会停止”；“相信国民党蒋介石不打我们了”；“相信国民党与蒋介石能搞民主改革”；相信国民党蒋介石“能和我们办民主建国”；“相信中国走向和平民主新阶段”；还有一个相信，相信美帝国主义头子“杜鲁门声明”。据此，他还提出所谓“三交换”：交出军队，“统一于国防部”，“换得全国民主化”；交出党权，“换得了我党的合法地位”；交出伟大的中国人民英勇奋斗和流血牺牲所得来的胜利果实，换得有些人“去作官，中央政府的官”，换得“美国借的二十万美金”。
    这个“报告”真是丑死了，臭死了！这那里是什么时局报告，这是彻头彻尾的大叛卖！
    他所说的那些话，美帝国主义和蒋介石已经讲过多次。美帝国主义向我们说：“你们要听一听赫尔利的话，派几个人到国民党政府里去做官”。蒋介石说：“共产党交出军队，才有合法地位”。这些“好话”，毛主席早已作了严正的驳斥。毛主席说：“捆住手脚的官不好做，我们不做”，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”，“人民的武装，一支枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去”。
    很清楚，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所说的“党性”，乃是国民党的党性，美国民主党的党性；他所绝对服从的纪律，乃是美帝国主义和蒋介石的所谓“军令政令”。
    他的立场就是这样鲜明：对杜鲁门和蒋介石，一副奴才相，不愧是一个奴性十足的“驯服工具”；而对我们伟大领袖毛主席和广大革命人民，则是桀骜顽劣，一副老爷架式。这就是他所宣扬的奴隶主义的阶级实质。
    例子不必再举了。
    总之，在每一个历史时期，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，都是这样对抗毛主席的英明领导，践踏党的决议，而竭力维护资产阶级的纪律，修正主义的纪律。
    四
    不同的阶级有不同的组织纪律。一个人只能遵守本阶级的组织纪律。无条件地遵守一切组织纪律，或者反对一切组织纪律的提法，都是极端虚伪的，骗人的。
    毛主席教导我们：“统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件。”严酷的阶级斗争，使无产阶级懂得，只有严格的组织纪律，才能形成为步调整齐、意志统一的坚强有力的队伍，才能保证政治路线的贯彻执行，把无产阶级的力量集中起来，指向一个共同的打击目标，战胜强大的敌人。我们反对奴隶主义，决不是反对服从党的组织纪律，恰恰相反，是为了加强无产阶级的革命的组织纪律。
    对于以伟大的领袖毛主席和毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志为首的中国共产党的组织纪律，对于伟大领袖毛主席的英明指示，我们要坚决执行，句句照办。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席的话，句句是真理。毛泽东思想是经过革命实践检验过的普遍真理，是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义。因此，毛主席的指示，理解了要执行，不理解也要执行。我们要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这是无产阶级的根本利益所在，这是我们的最高纪律。
    无产阶级政党，必须有自己的真正的、杰出的领袖，必须在全党树立领袖的绝对的革命权威。没有这个条件，党的纪律就不能成为钢铁的纪律，党的事业就没有胜利的保证。列宁说，没有“有极高威信的党的领袖”，“无产阶级专政、无产阶级的‘意志统一’，就会成为一句空话。”⑤中国共产党能够有毛主席这样伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，这是中国人民的最大幸福，这是全世界革命人民的最大幸福。
    对于执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的各级领导机关，一定要维护它的威信，树立它的权威。对于它的正确指示和决定，应该自觉遵守，坚决执行。如果有不同意见，可以提出来，但是，决不能用对待修正主义的组织、纪律的态度，来对待无产阶级的革命纪律。对各级领导机关的指示和决定是否服从，应该以它是否符合无产阶级的革命利益，是否符合于毛泽东思想为标准，而不能以自己的好恶为标准：合我胃口的就执行，不合的就不执行。不能把遵守革命的组织纪律当作奴隶主义来反对。反对一切领导、一切权威、一切组织、一切纪律，这是无政府主义思潮，必须坚决批判。
    不能用无政府主义来反对奴隶主义。奴隶主义同无政府主义，表面上看起来，是极端相反的，但是，在本质上却是相通的。两者都是剥削阶级的思想体系，在世界观上，都是形而上学、唯心主义。奴隶主义主张盲从，不要真理；无政府主义主张怀疑一切，打倒一切，把无政府主义奉为绝对，同样是不承认真理，主张盲从。我们既反对奴隶主义，也反对无政府主义；更反对用打倒一切政权、反对一切组织纪律的无政府主义去代替奴隶主义。决不能从一个极端走到另一个极端。
    怀疑一切，打倒一切，否定一切的无政府主义，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派抛出来的反动思想。在他们掌权的时候，他们就宣扬奴隶主义，搞愚民政策来维持自己的反革命修正主义的专政。而在他们失去权力的时候，他们就抛出无政府主义，来制造混乱，反对无产阶级专政。在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派那里，奴隶主义同无政府主义在本质上是完全一致的，都是用来反对无产阶级专政、维护修正主义统治的思想武器。
    目前，有些人在反对奴隶主义的时候，宣扬并且奉行无政府主义，他们唯我独尊，只有“我”是绝对正确的，凡是不符合“我”的，就是什么“资产阶级反动路线”，就是“反革命复辟的最后阵地”，要统统打倒。在这里，奉劝一声，主张打倒一切的人，坚持下去，自己也会被打倒的。
    我们必须用毛泽东思想作为武器，去批判奴隶主义，去反对无政府主义。对任何东西，都要用鼻子嗅一嗅，既不要盲目接受，也不要盲目反对。要遵照毛主席的教导：“凡事应该用脑筋好好想一想”，“去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性”，“学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯”。一切东西都要由革命的实践来检验，用毛泽东思想来审查。
    自觉地遵守革命纪律是革命的需要。
    解放战争取得全国胜利前夕，毛主席向全党全军和全国人民指出：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，即擅自修改中央的或上级党委的政策和策略，执行他们自以为是的违背统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的政策和策略；在工作繁忙的借口之下，采取事前不请示事后不报告的错误态度，将自己管理的地方，看成好象一个独立国。这种状态，给予革命利益的损害，极为巨大。各级党委必须对这一点进行反复讨论，认真克服这种无纪律状态或无政府状态，将一切可能和必须集中的权力，集中于中央和中央代表机关。”我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的这个教导，坚决反对无政府主义，坚决同一切违反党的统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的行为作斗争。
    今天，为了无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，我们必须象伟大的人民解放军那样，具有高度的政治觉悟和铁的纪律，大大提高我们的组织纪律性，坚决执行毛主席和党中央的方针政策，不允许任何破坏纪律的现象发生。
