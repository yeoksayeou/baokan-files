June 1, 1967, 2nd Edition

At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories, and when the entire Chinese proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses are enthusiastically celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau held a symposium titled "Marking the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" in Beijing, the leadership center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

More than 80 writers and friends from 34 countries and regions across six continents attended the symposium. The holding of this international conference dedicated to the study and discussion of Chairman Mao's works is a concrete manifestation of the world entering a completely new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner! It shows that the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and his literary and artistic theories are becoming powerful ideological weapons for the revolutionary people of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries. It is also the direction of the struggle for the Afro-Asian revolutionary and progressive writers' movement.

The symposium venue was filled with the fervent emotions of the revolutionary people of the world loving Chairman Mao, and was permeated with a revolutionary, united, and combative atmosphere. Writers and friends from various countries, holding the red book of revolution—Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"—entered the venue joyfully. They looked up with deep respect at the giant portrait of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, hanging on the ceiling of the stage, and excitedly read the quotations from Chairman Mao written in Chinese, Arabic, English, and French around the venue. During the meeting, the writers and friends from various countries enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

At 8:30 PM, the opening ceremony was held. At this time, the friends from various countries, with boundless respect for Chairman Mao, held the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud in different languages: "All the people of the world, unite! Oppose our common enemy—the United States imperialists and their accomplices! All the people of the world, be brave, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All the devils will be destroyed." "To make literature and art a good component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, to help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind."

Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese Writers' Delegation, was invited to preside over the opening ceremony. In his speech, he pointed out that from the perspective of an international conference, it is unprecedented in human history to have so many friends from various countries gathering to study and discuss Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that the success of this conference will have a demonstrative effect on the Afro-Asian people and the revolutionary people of the world in learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. It will also have a profound impact on the struggle of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, further strengthen unity, and oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries.

Senanayake, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, delivered the opening speech. He said that Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks" has extremely great international significance. It provides correct political guidance to all revolutionary and progressive literary and artistic workers and is the guiding light for the Afro-Asian writers' movement and all revolutionary and progressive literary and artistic workers in the world.

Senanayake said that the purpose of holding this symposium is to study how we can better combine the two fronts of the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples of various countries—cultural front and military front—according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Senanayake talked about how, on the issue of literature and art, the revolutionary and progressive writers of the Asian and African countries, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have waged a resolute struggle against the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, exposing their various fallacies of separating literature and art from revolutionary struggle. He pointed out that the revolutionary and progressive writers of the Asian and African countries and various countries have fundamental differences in principle with the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union on the issue of literature and art. This is whether to have a revolution or not, whether to be anti-imperialist or not. He said that the revolutionary and progressive writers of the Asian and African countries, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly uphold the great banner of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, supporting the national liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples. However, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union advocate the fallacy of "art for art's sake," stripping the revolutionary political content of culture and art, catering to the needs of imperialism and old and new colonialism, and corrupting and numbing the fighting will of the Asian and African peoples.

Senanayake said that he hoped the participants of the symposium, in the process of studying and discussing this great work "Talks," would, according to the revolutionary line proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong, make contributions to the development of revolutionary literature and art.

Subsequently, friends from various countries delivered speeches to the conference. Chahardo, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, said in his speech that when 700 million Chinese people are carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, and when the revolutionary people of the world are entering a new historical period under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau organizes this symposium in the world revolutionary center of Beijing. This is of great historical and international significance, and this symposium will surely succeed.

Chahardo said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people to defeat internal and external enemies and is also a powerful ideological weapon for the peoples of all countries to oppose imperialism, old and new colonialism, fascism, and modern revisionism, and to struggle for national and social liberation, democracy, and peace. Chahardo warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that today, in the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the two classes, and the two lines, the billion Chinese people who uphold the proletarian revolutionary line have achieved great victories. This victory will have the greatest impact on the peoples of all countries who are struggling in the world and on the world revolution.

Sudanese writer Osman Hassan Ahmed pointed out that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has spread to all corners of the African continent, dispersing the dark clouds and fog there, enabling the fighting African people to see the road to victory. He pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and is a powerful weapon against the various corrupt bourgeois and revisionist ideas spread by the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union to sabotage the just struggle of the African people.

Osman warmly praised the holding of this symposium. He said that this symposium, held under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, is a very meaningful event in the history of the world revolutionary literary and artistic movement. It will be recorded in gold letters in the annals of the Afro-Asian writers' movement and in the history of the world literary and artistic movement. It will have a profound impact on the future revolutionary literary and artistic movement.

American writer Anna Louise Strong recalled in her speech the situation in which Chairman Mao received her in Yan'an in the spring of 1946 and 1947, and the great encouragement and education she received from Chairman Mao's talks. She said that Chairman Mao wisely pointed out that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and the truly powerful force belongs to the people. Therefore, we writers should rely on the people. She said that Chairman Mao told us that when the people's awareness is raised, imperialism will be powerless, so awakening the people's awareness with Chairman Mao's teachings is our task as writers.

Haitian friend Fidelia said in his speech that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a brilliant work that tolls the death knell for all the reactionary and outdated views of the bourgeoisie. It is the program for the struggle of all the oppressed and exploited peoples in the world.

He said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is the great guide for the development of Chinese society in the past 25 years of this century. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in China, which has world significance and aims to prevent the restoration of capitalism in communism, is being carried out under the guidance of "Talks." "Talks" is a great red banner that points out the road to victory for the international proletariat in its attack on the last bastion of the bourgeoisie. It proves that all literary and artistic works have class content and thus proves that culture and art should first be revolutionary.

He said that we Haitian revolutionaries do not want the poisonous goods provided by imperialism and its revisionist running dogs to continue to enslave us. We need literature and art that can serve as a powerful weapon in our struggle to liberate ourselves from the claws of American imperialism. Only Chairman Mao's "Talks" can give us such literature and art. This brilliant work is an invaluable contribution by the great teacher of the international proletariat to the people of the world. Fidelia ended his speech by enthusiastically shouting in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!"

New Zealand friend Louis Ayling said in his speech that revolutionary writers and artists must know for whom they are serving. In the struggle against American imperialism's aggression in various parts of the world and in the current international class struggle, writers should write more to explain where the true power lies, to explain that the people are stronger than weapons. Today, we are facing a changing world, and we writers should act quickly to fight with our pens.

Albanian friend Hasan Bejtulla said in his speech that every revolutionary writer should first study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks," serve the people's cause wholeheartedly, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly. Literature and art should be a powerful weapon for struggling for the progress of society and for the sacred cause of the communist revolution.

He said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" has made an immeasurable contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism aesthetics and proletarian literature and art. The views put forward by Chairman Mao in "Talks," whether in China or in the world, have particularly great significance for establishing a revolutionary literature and art that serves proletarian politics and class struggle.

He said that in the great struggle to the death between Marxism-Leninism aesthetics, proletarian literature and art, and imperialist aesthetics, bourgeois literature and art, Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks" has illuminated the way forward for revolutionary literary and artistic workers around the world. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers around the world should strengthen their combat friendship with Chinese literary and artistic workers armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, raise the banner of revolutionary literature and art higher, and launch a struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. For the sacred cause of people's struggle for freedom and the revolutionary cause of communism, we will make our contributions.

American friend Robert F. Williams said in his speech that Chairman Mao's thought is universally applicable. In all places and at all times, it is the guiding ideology of revolutionaries. Robert Williams said that the pen and the gun are two indispensable weapons for overthrowing oppression and tyranny. We, the oppressed people, and those of us who are working and struggling for the liberation of the oppressed, understand the truth contained in the following words of Chairman Mao: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. But having only such an army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy."

He said that the country I come from not only uses brutal and savage force to invade, but also uses decadent culture to invade, subvert, and conquer. It particularly uses invading culture as a weapon of war and conquest. We must stand up and respond to this challenge at this time. Let us, in the true spirit of Yan'an, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call and begin our Long March to victory.

Representative of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Chinese Writers' Association, Yang Kuangman, said in his speech: Now, the boundless Mao Zedong Thought has been grasped by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country and is also being grasped by the broad revolutionary people of the world. It not only guides the Chinese revolution to achieve one great victory after another but will also surely guide the world revolution to achieve the final victory. This is the inevitable law of historical development, which no one can stop. We revolutionary and progressive writers should follow the inevitable law of historical development, actively propagate the most advanced thought of the contemporary era—the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and let Mao Zedong Thought be grasped by the broader masses of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. This is the most glorious and sacred duty of every revolutionary and progressive writer.

Yang Kuangman said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is the ideological weapon for the oppressed classes and peoples of the world to engage in a great class struggle against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries. It is the battle cry for the revolutionaries of various countries to advance in the struggle against imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries in the fields of ideology, politics, and culture. It is the program and guide to action for destroying all reactionary cultures of the exploiting classes and establishing a new culture of the proletariat and laboring people. All revolutionary and progressive writers should firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly devote themselves to the fiery struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, enthusiastically sing the praises of the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and their heroic figures, mercilessly expose the cruelty and weakness of the enemy, and turn over the history that has been overturned by the ruling classes for thousands of years, so that literature and art truly become powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, so that the people awaken, take up weapons, and bury imperialism and all its accomplices and running dogs.

The opening ceremony was attended by representatives from Ceylon, China, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan, member countries of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau.

Other writers and friends attending the opening ceremony came from Burma, Iran, Malaya, North Kalimantan, Palestine, the Philippines, Thailand, Yemen, Azania (South Africa), Botswana, Eritrea, Guinea, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Niger, Somalia, Tanzania, Southwest Africa, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Haiti, Albania, the United States, Belgium, Britain, France, New Zealand, Spain, and other countries and regions.

At the end of the opening ceremony, Senanayake, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, led everyone to shout with great enthusiasm: "Long live the brilliant 'Talks' of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great revolutionary people of China!" "Long live the unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world!" "Down with imperialism! Down with revisionism!" The resounding slogans once again expressed the firm will of the revolutionary people of the world and the revolutionary and progressive writers to unite and fight under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought.

The conference will enter the discussion phase on June 1.

    亚非作家常设局举行纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会
    热烈欢呼世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代
    各国作家和朋友指出，《讲话》是全世界人民战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，争取民族和社会解放的强大思想武器，是全世界一切革命和进步的文艺工作者的指路明灯，是摧毁一切剥削阶级反动文化，建立无产阶级和劳动人民新文化的纲领
    新华社三十一日讯　在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时刻，在全中国无产阶级革命派和革命群众热烈庆祝毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的高潮中，由亚非作家常设局举行的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会”，今天在中国无产阶级文化大革命的领导中心——北京隆重开幕。
    来自世界六大洲三十四个国家和地区的八十多位作家和朋友，参加了讨论会。这个专门学习、讨论毛主席著作的国际性会议的举行，是全世界正在进入一个完全崭新的、以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代的具体表现！显示着光焰无际的毛泽东思想，毛主席的革命文艺路线和文艺理论，正在成为世界革命人民反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器，成为亚非革命和进步作家运动的战斗方向。
    讨论会会场上，充满了世界革命人民无限热爱毛主席的热烈情绪，洋溢着一派革命、团结、战斗的气氛。各国作家和朋友手拿红彤彤的革命宝书——毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，兴高采烈地走进会场。他们以无限崇敬的心情仰望高挂在主席台天幕上的世界革命人民伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，兴奋地诵读会场四周用中文、阿拉伯文、英文和法文书写的毛主席语录。在会议进行中，各国作家和朋友热情地高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    晚上八时半，举行了会议开幕式。这时，各国朋友怀着对毛主席无限崇敬的心情，手捧红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，用不同语言齐声朗读：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
    中国作家代表团团长郭沫若应邀主持开幕式。他在致词中指出，从国际会议来讲，有这么多的各国朋友欢聚一堂，专门学习、讨论毛泽东思想，这是人类有史以来破天荒的第一次。他指出，这次会议的成功，对于亚非人民和全世界革命人民学习、运用毛泽东思想必将起到示范作用，对于全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民以毛泽东思想为武器，进一步加强团结，反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，必将产生深远的影响。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克首先致开幕词。他说，毛主席的光辉著作《讲话》具有极其伟大的国际意义，它给予一切革命的和进步的文艺工作者以正确的政治指导，是我们亚非作家运动以及全世界一切革命和进步的文艺工作者的指路明灯。
    森纳那亚克说，我们举行这次讨论会的目的是，研究我们怎样才能更好地根据毛主席的教导，把被压迫的各国人民争取解放斗争中两个战线——文化战线和军事战线——结合起来。
    森纳那亚克谈到，在文学艺术问题上，亚非各国革命的和进步的作家，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同苏联现代修正主义者进行了坚决的斗争，揭露了苏联现代修正主义者把文学艺术同革命斗争割裂开来的种种谬论。他指出，亚非和各国革命的和进步的作家同苏联现代修正主义者在文学艺术问题上存在着根本的原则分歧，这就是要革命还是不要革命，要反帝还是不要反帝。他说，亚非革命的和进步的作家，在毛泽东思想的指引下，坚持高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支持亚非各国人民民族解放斗争的伟大旗帜，而苏联现代修正主义者却极力鼓吹为艺术而艺术的谬论，抽掉文化和艺术的革命政治内容，迎合帝国主义和新老殖民主义的需要，腐蚀和麻痹亚非人民的斗争意志。
    森纳那亚克说，我希望讨论会的参加者在学习和讨论《讲话》这部伟大著作的过程中，根据毛泽东主席所提出的革命路线，为发展革命的文艺做出贡献。
    接着，各国朋友向会议致贺词。亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多在致词中说，当七亿中国人民在毛主席亲自领导下进行着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的时候，正当世界革命人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下进入一个崭新的历史时期的时候，亚非作家常设局在世界革命的中心北京，组织这个讨论会，是具有重大历史意义和国际意义的，这个讨论会必将获得成功。
    查禾多说，毛主席的《讲话》这部伟大著作，是中国人民战胜内外敌人的强大思想武器，也是全世界各国人民反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义、法西斯主义和修正主义，争取民族和社会解放、民主与和平的思想武器。查禾多热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，今天，在资产阶级和无产阶级的两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，维护无产阶级革命路线的亿万中国人民获得了伟大胜利。这一胜利对全世界正在斗争中的各国人民和世界革命，必将产生最伟大的影响。
    苏丹作家奥斯曼·哈桑·艾哈迈德指出，毛泽东思想的光辉已经深入到非洲大陆的四面八方，驱散了那里的黑云和迷雾，使战斗中的非洲人民能够认清他们胜利的道路。他指出，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是反对苏联现代修正主义领导集团为了破坏非洲人民的正义斗争而散布的一切腐朽的资产阶级和修正主义思想的强大武器。
    奥斯曼热烈赞扬这次讨论会的召开。他说，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下召开的这次会议，是世界革命文艺运动史上一次极为有意义的事件，它将以金字记载在亚非作家运动史册上，记载在世界文艺运动的历史上。它将对今后的革命文艺运动产生深远的影响。
    美国著名作家斯特朗在致词中，回顾了毛主席一九四六年和一九四七年春天在延安接见她的情况，以及她从毛主席的谈话中所得到的巨大鼓舞和教育。她说，毛主席英明地指出，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，真正强大的力量是属于人民。因此，我们作家就要依靠人民。她说，毛主席告诉我们，人民提高了觉悟，帝国主义就没有力量了，因此，用毛主席的教导唤醒人民的觉悟，这就是我们作家的任务。
    海地朋友菲德利亚在致词中说，毛泽东主席的《讲话》这部天才的著作，敲响了一切资产阶级的反动的陈腐观点的丧钟，它是世界上一切被压迫和被剥削人民的斗争纲领。
    他说，毛主席的《讲话》是本世纪最近二十五年当中中国社会发展的伟大指南，中国现在开展的使共产主义免遭资本主义复辟的具有世界意义的文化大革命，就是在《讲话》的指引下进行的。《讲话》是给国际无产阶级在向资产阶级的最后堡垒进攻中指出了胜利道路的一面伟大的红旗。它指出一切文艺作品是具有阶级内容的，从而证明了文化和艺术首先应该是革命的。
    他说，我们海地革命者不要帝国主义和它的走狗修正主义为了继续奴役我们而供给我们的那种有毒的货色。我们需要那种能作为我们争取从美帝国主义的魔爪下解放出来的斗争的强大武器的文艺。只有毛主席的《讲话》才能给予我们这种文艺。《讲话》这一天才著作，是国际无产阶级的伟大导师对世界人民的不可估量的贡献。菲德利亚讲话结束时用中国话热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
    新西兰朋友路易·艾黎在致词中说，革命的作家和艺术家必须懂得自己是在为谁服务。在反对美帝国主义在世界各地进行侵略的斗争中，在当前国际阶级斗争中，作家应该写出更多的东西来说明真正的力量之所在，说明人民比武器更为强大。今天我们正面临一个变化的世界，我们作家应该迅速行动起来用笔来进行战斗。
    阿尔巴尼亚朋友哈桑·贝特莱拉在致词中说，每个革命的作家首先应该学习毛泽东同志的《讲话》这部光辉著作，应毫无保留地为人民的事业服务，应该全心全意地为工农兵服务，要使文艺成为为了社会的进步，为了神圣的共产主义革命事业而斗争的强有力的武器。
    他说，毛泽东同志的《讲话》对马克思列宁主义的美学和无产阶级文艺的发展作出了不可估量的贡献。毛泽东同志在《讲话》里所提出的观点，无论在中国还是在全世界，对建立一个革命的、为无产阶级政治服务的、为阶级斗争服务的无产阶级文艺，都具有特别重大的意义。
    他说，在当前马列主义的美学、无产阶级的文艺与帝国主义的美学、资产阶级文艺之间的你死我活的伟大斗争中，毛主席的《讲话》这部光辉著作为全世界革命文艺工作者照亮了前进的道路。全世界革命的文艺工作者要和用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国文艺工作者加强战斗友谊，更高地举起革命文艺的大旗，展开反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，为了人民争取自由的神圣事业，为共产主义的革命事业作出我们的贡献。
    美国朋友罗伯特·威廉在致词中说，毛主席的思想是放之四海而皆准的。在所有的地方和所有的时期，它都是革命者的指导思想。罗伯特·威廉说，笔杆子和枪杆子是推翻压迫和暴政不可缺少的两个武器。我们被压迫的人们，我们正在为被压迫者的解放而工作和斗争的人懂得毛主席下面所说的话所包含的真理：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”
    他说，我来自的国家，不仅使用残忍、野蛮的武力进行侵略，同时也通过堕落的文化来进行侵略、颠覆和征服。它特别利用侵略的文化来作为战争的武器、征服的武器。我们在这个时候必须起来，必须回答这个挑战。让我们根据真正的延安精神，坚决响应毛主席的号召，开始我们的走向胜利的长征。
    中国作家协会无产阶级革命派的代表杨框满在致词中说：现在，光焰无际的毛泽东思想已经掌握了我国亿万革命群众，也正在掌握全世界广大的革命人民，它不但引导中国革命取得一个又一个的伟大胜利，也必将引导世界革命取得最后胜利。这是历史发展的必然规律，是任何人也阻挡不了的。我们革命的和进步的作家就应当遵循历史发展的必然规律，积极宣传当代唯一最先进的思想——伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想为亚非和世界各国更广大的人民群众所掌握，这是我们每一个革命的和进步的作家最光荣、最神圣的职责。
    杨框满说，毛主席的《讲话》是全世界被压迫阶级、被压迫人民同以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派进行阶级大搏斗的思想武器，是各国革命者在思想上、政治上、文化上向帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派斗争的进军号角，是摧毁一切剥削阶级反动文化，建立无产阶级和劳动人民新文化的纲领和行动指南。一切革命的和进步的作家，都应该坚定不移地遵循毛主席的教导，长期地、无条件地、全心全意地投身到工农兵群众的火热斗争中去，热情地歌颂工农兵群众的斗争和他们的英雄人物，无情地揭露敌人的残暴和虚弱，把几千年来被统治阶级颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来，使文艺真正成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器，使人民觉醒起来，拿起武器，埋葬帝国主义及其一切帮凶和走狗。
    参加今天开幕式的，有亚非作家常设局成员国锡兰、中国、印度尼西亚、日本、苏丹的代表。
    参加开幕式的其他作家和朋友，来自缅甸、伊朗、马来亚、北加里曼丹、巴勒斯坦、菲律宾、泰国、也门、阿扎尼亚（南非）、博茨瓦纳、厄里特尼亚、几内亚、刚果（布）、刚果（金）、尼日尔、索马里、坦桑尼亚、西南非洲、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、海地、阿尔巴尼亚、美国、比利时、英国、法国、新西兰、西班牙等国家和地区。
    开幕式结束时，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克满腔热情，举臂带领大家高呼：“光辉的毛主席的《讲话》万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大的中国革命人民万岁！”“亚非拉和全世界人民团结万岁！”“打倒帝国主义！打倒修正主义！”响亮的口号声，再一次表达了世界革命人民和革命的进步作家决心在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下团结战斗的坚强意志。
    会议将于六月一日进入讨论。
