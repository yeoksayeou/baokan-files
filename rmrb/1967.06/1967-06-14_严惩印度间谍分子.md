    The spy, the Second Secretary of the former Indian Embassy in China, Lu Guannan, has been exposed by the Chinese people. This individual, who appeared to be a respectable diplomat, was in fact a sneaky international spy.

    It was this very Lu Guannan who has consistently engaged in espionage activities, gathering intelligence on our country. This time, he infiltrated our military restricted area, stole intelligence, and was caught red-handed by our PLA. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent a note to the Indian government, expressing the strongest protest, and declared that we no longer recognize Lu Guannan's diplomatic status. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court held a public trial for this spy and sentenced him to expulsion from the country, to be executed immediately. This is a major measure taken by our dictatorship organs to safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a significant achievement in protecting our country's national security and state secrets. The Chinese people fully support our government's principled stance in maintaining national sovereignty and security.

    Our proletarian dictatorship not only suppresses domestic class enemies but also deals with subversive activities and potential invasions from external enemies of the state. On Chinese soil, we only allow the reactionaries to behave properly; we do not allow them to cause trouble. As Chairman Mao taught, we "do not give any internal or external reactionaries any freedom to engage in counter-revolutionary activities." For the victorious people, this right is "as essential as cloth, rice, and beans, and cannot be dispensed with for a moment. This is a good thing, a protective charm, a family heirloom that must not be discarded until the day when imperialism abroad and classes at home are thoroughly and completely eliminated."

    Our judicial organs are institutions of proletarian dictatorship. Regardless of who it is, or what legal guise they wear, if they engage in espionage activities that endanger our country's sovereignty and security, the Chinese people will expose them and impose the legal punishment they deserve. Indian diplomats dared to engage in espionage activities, stealing intelligence, and causing trouble during our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will not hesitate to subject them to a public trial by our revolutionary people and make them taste the stern judgment of the Chinese revolutionary court, ordering them to pack up and leave.

    The Indian reactionaries are two-faced, having long followed the Americans and Soviet revisionists in their frenzied anti-China activities. Now, our revolutionary court's public trial of the Indian spy is not only a powerful blow to the Indian reactionaries but also a stern warning to the American and British imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists who are scheming to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and sabotage our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    Chairman Mao pointed out: "The imperialists send their running dogs into China to carry out divisive and disruptive work. This is inevitable; they will never forget this task."

    During this great and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary people of our country must be vigilant and must not forget about the class enemies abroad.

    严惩印度间谍分子
    本报评论员
    间谍分子，原印度驻华使馆二等秘书鲁冠南，被中国人民揪出来了。这个家伙表面上是个冠冕堂皇的外交人员，暗地里却是鬼鬼祟祟的国际间谍。
    就是这个鲁冠南，一贯进行间谍活动，刺探我国情报。这一次，他竟潜入我军事禁区，窃取情报，当场被我解放军抓住。我国外交部已经照会印度政府，提出最强烈的抗议，宣布不再承认鲁冠南的外交官身份。北京市高级人民法院对这个间谍犯举行了公审，并判处驱逐出境，立即执行。这是我国专政机构保卫无产阶级文化大革命的重大措施，是保卫我国国家安全和国家机密的重大成果。我国人民完全拥护我国政府维护国家主权和安全的严正立场。
    我国的无产阶级专政，不仅要镇压国内的阶级敌人，而且也要对付国家外部敌人的颠覆活动和可能的侵略。在中国的土地上，我们只许反动派规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。正如毛主席教导的那样，我们“不给任何内外反动派有任何反革命的自由活动的权利。”对胜利的人民，这种权利是“如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”
    我国的司法机关是无产阶级专政的机构。不管是谁，披着什么样的合法外衣，只要干了危害我国主权和安全的间谍活动，中国人民就要把他揪出来，并给予应得的法律制裁。印度外交官竟敢在我国无产阶级文化大革命期间，混水摸鱼，窃取情报，为非作歹，大搞间谍活动，我们就毫不客气，要他受到我国革命人民的公审，尝尝中国革命法庭严正判决的滋味，还要勒令他卷铺盖滚蛋。
    印度反动派是一仆二主，他们长期以来跟着美帝和苏修猖狂反华。现在，我国革命法庭公审印度间谍，不仅是对印度反动派的有力打击，也是对那些处心积虑，妄图颠覆我国无产阶级专政、破坏我国无产阶级文化大革命的美英帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义的严正警告。
    毛主席指出：帝国主义者“派遣他们的走狗钻进中国内部来进行分化工作和捣乱工作。这是必然的，他们决不会忘记这一项工作。”
    我国革命人民，在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的时候，一定要有敌情观念，一定不要忘记国外阶级敌人。
