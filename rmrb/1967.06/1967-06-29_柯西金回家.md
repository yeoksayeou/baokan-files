Kosygin, the head of the Soviet revisionists, dressed up and went to the doorstep. Upon arriving in Glassboro, he couldn't help but feel elated, sweetly telling Johnson, "I am already very accustomed to this place, coming here is like coming home."

Kosygin's trip to the United States was originally intended to meet Johnson. However, at first, he was coy and hesitant, half-revealing and half-concealing. One moment he would say he wasn't there to meet Johnson; the next moment he would say he would soon leave New York and return home. In the end, he did not return to his home in Moscow but joyfully rushed to Glassboro, falling into Johnson's embrace.

Kosygin indeed returned home. Look, he brought his daughter, met Johnson and his wife and daughter, all grinning from ear to ear, faces beaming with smiles. Exchanging watches, strolling on the beach, family photos, sharing a meal, truly a scene of family reunion. Creating such a warm family atmosphere was not to establish a kinship between the Kosygin and Johnson families, to chat about family matters, but to engage in dirty political deals between the heads of the imperialist family and the traitorous gang of bureaucrats.

Kosygin indeed returned home. He couldn't help but say this, revealing his traitorous psychology. This is the Soviet revisionist clique's complete betrayal of the Soviet people and the people of the world, a confession of formally joining the so-called "free world family."

Kosygin indeed returned home. Johnson and Kosygin, one is the big boss of the Washington monopolists, the other is the chief steward of the Moscow bourgeois privileged class. Common class nature, common interests, common likes and dislikes, common fate, make them one family.

Kosygin indeed returned home. The Soviet revisionist clique has always been a faithful servant and a useful accomplice of American imperialism. The likes of Kosygin, while in the Soviet Union, have their hearts in the White House; they eat the Soviet people's food and do the work of American imperialism. Working hard and running around, once they gain the boss's favor, how could they not be grateful and overjoyed? Thus, the feeling of returning home arises naturally.

Johnson said to Kosygin, "We both have a special responsibility for the safety of our families, and above our two families is the safety of the entire human family living on this earth." Johnson's first half of the sentence can be said to be true; they want to maintain the "safety" of American monopolists and the Soviet privileged class. The second half is a lie. In Vietnam, in Arabia, and in all places where anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles are taking place, the two families collude, killing and burning, plundering and exploiting. They want to dominate everything, to rule the world. With their "safety," there is no safety for the oppressed peoples and nations.

History is unforgiving. Eight years ago, when the traitor Khrushchev went to Camp David to meet Eisenhower, he was so proud and forgetful. He did not expect that Camp David became a milestone on his road to destruction. Now, Kosygin has come to Glassboro and happily thinks he is returning home. In fact, this is not his "home." Glassboro is merely a stop on the road to the grave for the traitor Kosygin and his gang.

### 柯西金回家

    柯西金回家
    苏修头目柯西金，梳妆打扮，送上门去。他到了葛拉斯堡罗，就禁不住心花怒放，甜蜜蜜地对约翰逊说：“我已经很习惯于这个地方了，来这里就象回家一样。”
    柯西金去美国，本来就是为了求见约翰逊的。但开初几天，他还忸怩作态，犹抱琵琶半遮面。一会儿说，他不是来同约翰逊会晤的；一会儿说，他很快就要离开纽约回家了。结果，他并没有回到莫斯科的家，却兴高采烈地跑到葛拉斯堡罗，倒在约翰逊的怀抱里去了。
    柯西金的确是回家了。你看，他带着女儿，同约翰逊和他的老婆、女儿会了面，个个呲牙咧嘴，笑容满脸。送金表，逛海滩，老少合影，共进家宴，真个是充满了“家人团聚的景象”。制造这种亲如家人的气氛，当然不是为了约柯两家攀亲戚，叙家常，而是为了美苏两家，帝国主义的头子和叛徒工贼集团的头子，进行肮脏的政治交易。
    柯西金的确是回家了。他情不自禁地讲这句话，是他叛徒心理的自然流露。这是苏修集团彻底背叛苏联人民和全世界人民的自白，是正式加入所谓“自由世界大家庭”的供词。
    柯西金的确是回家了。约翰逊和柯西金，一个是华盛顿垄断资本的大老板，一个是莫斯科资产阶级特权阶层的大总管。共同的阶级本性，共同的利害关系，共同的爱憎，共同的命运，使他们成了一家人。
    柯西金的确是回家了。苏修集团一直就是美帝国主义的忠实的奴仆，得力的帮凶。柯西金之流身在苏联，心在白宫；吃苏联人民的饭，干美帝国主义的事。辛辛苦苦，奔走效劳，一旦得到老板青睐，怎能不感激涕零，受宠若惊呢？于是，回家之感，油然而生。
    约翰逊对柯西金说：“我们双方对于我们家庭的安全，负有特别的责任，而驾凌于我们双方的家庭之上的，是居住在这个地球上的整个人类家庭的安全。”约翰逊的前半句话，无妨说它是真的，他们要维护的，就是美国垄断资本和苏联特权阶层的“安全”；后半句话，是骗人的，在越南，在阿拉伯，在一切正在进行着反帝革命斗争的地方，苏美两家相互勾结，杀人放火，掠夺剥削，他们是要驾凌于一切之上，主宰全世界。有他们的“安全”，就没有被压迫人民和被压迫民族的安全。
    历史是无情的。八年前，叛徒赫鲁晓夫到戴维营去会见艾森豪威尔时，曾经是何等的得意忘形。他没有想到，正是戴维营成了他走向灭亡的一个路标。现在，柯西金到了葛拉斯堡罗，就高兴地自以为是回家了。其实，这也不是他的“家”。葛拉斯堡罗，也不过是叛徒柯西金及其一伙奔往墓地道路上的一个驿站而已。
