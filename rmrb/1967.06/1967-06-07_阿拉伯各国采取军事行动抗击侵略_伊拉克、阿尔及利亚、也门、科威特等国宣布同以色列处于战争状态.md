Arab countries have taken military actions to resist the armed aggression by the U.S. imperialist lackey, Israel. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 6, in order to resist the armed aggression by Israel, Arab countries have taken various military actions.

The United Arab Republic (UAR) announced on June 5 that the country is in a state of emergency. The UAR People's Resistance Command issued a statement saying that the National Guard and other military organizations are taking up their positions according to the original plan, serving as the reserve forces of the armed forces to defend the motherland and counter the aggression.

On June 5, Syria's Interior Minister Ashawi ordered the establishment of the National Civil Defense Supreme Committee. In seven cities near the frontline or along the coast, including Damascus and ships anchored in the inland sea, a blackout was imposed. Syria's Minister of Defense announced that from June 5, all ships are prohibited from entering within 12 nautical miles of Syrian territorial waters, and only ships following the designated three-nautical-mile-wide channel are allowed to enter the port.

The Palestine Liberation Organization issued a statement on June 5, calling on the Palestine Liberation Army, the National Guard, the People's Resistance Army, and all Palestinians to join the life-and-death struggle to resist Israeli aggression and strive for national liberation.

Iraq's President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Arif, announced on June 5 that the Iraqi government is in a state of war with Israel. Any country that aids Israel will be considered an act of aggression against Iraq.

Yemen's President Sallal said at the Yemeni Armed Forces headquarters on June 5, "Israel's armed aggression against the UAR today is an aggression against us and against all Arab countries. We declare a state of war with Israel and Yemen is in a state of emergency."

The Algerian government issued a communiqué on June 5 stating, "Due to Israel's aggression against the Arab nation, Algeria considers itself in a state of war with Israel." The communiqué said that the Algerian government has taken all practical measures to implement a comprehensive and effective general mobilization. Various military branches and all necessary supplies for supporting the battle are being dispatched and transported to the frontline to repel the aggression and ensure the final victory. The Executive Bureau of the National Liberation Front of Algeria held an emergency meeting on June 5 and decided to establish volunteer units and vigilance and action committees throughout Algeria. The volunteer units will receive various political and necessary military training and, if necessary, will serve as the reserve forces of the Algerian National People's Army.
