The revolutionary masses of Shanghai Ink Factory, at the crucial moment of launching a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, closely combine the revolutionary great criticism with the factory's struggle, criticism, and reform. They firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, making the revolutionary great criticism more profound and solid, and raising the level of the factory's struggle, criticism, and reform.

Before the great criticism, the revolutionary cadres and workers of the proletariat in this factory had already exposed the numerous crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who had capitulated and compromised with the bourgeoisie. These capitalist-roaders within the Party relied on and promoted capitalists, allowing many of the factory's powers to fall into the hands of capitalists and their agents. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party frequently praised the capitalists' management and technical skills, shamelessly urging Party cadres to "care more about the capitalists," even planning to recruit capitalists into the Party. Under the promotion and elevation of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, capitalists occupied important leadership positions from the factory level down to the department and workshop levels, holding significant power. Workers from working-class backgrounds were marginalized, and in many aspects, the worker masses actually lost their right to speak.

Therefore, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in collusion with the capitalists, implemented a set of capitalist management methods and a reactionary bourgeois line in the factory's operations and management, practicing bourgeois dictatorship.

Under the protection of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the capitalists in the factory were extremely arrogant.

In this great criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers in this factory linked the reactionary words and deeds of the capitalist-roaders within the factory and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party shamelessly praised the capitalists for their "exploitation merits" and "competence," advocating for "capitalists to manage the factory" and for workers and cadres to "learn from the capitalists." This echoed the tune of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory and the capitalists. The workers said: The handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory are the backers of the capitalists within the factory, the agents of the bourgeoisie within the factory. They want to restore capitalism within the factory; the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the ultimate backer of all capitalists nationwide, the biggest agent of the bourgeoisie within the Party nationwide. He wants to turn our entire socialist country into a capitalist country, dragging us laboring people back to the old path of exploitation and oppression. The broad revolutionary workers saw the greater harm of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party from the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory; from hating only the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory, they further progressed to hating the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. They said: The ultimate backer of revisionism is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. His black hands have reached our factory. We must uproot the ultimate backer and cut off his black hands, ensuring our country will never change color.

In the great criticism, the awareness of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers was further heightened. They more deeply exposed new issues regarding the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory promoting capitalists, cultivating bourgeois successors, and fostering loyalists. They revealed that in production and technical management, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party implemented a reactionary bourgeois line, fundamentally distrusting the worker masses. Workers on the front lines of production had no right to speak. Now, they have broken through these old regulations that shackled the workers' hands and feet, greatly mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm and creativity for production.

In the great criticism, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao was further implemented. During the movement, some cadres who had made mistakes dared not join the revolution, fearing that the masses would not believe them. Some workers also had reservations. To address these active thoughts, the revolutionary committee of this factory held several meetings, criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party on the cadre issue, which is part of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique." They exposed the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory. Through the great criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers more consciously implemented the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, actively helping and encouraging cadres who had made mistakes to "come out," and rebelling against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

The cadres who made mistakes in this movement spoke out during the great criticism, exposing the heinous crimes of the capitalist-roaders within the factory and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, angrily denouncing the harm of "Self-Cultivation" on themselves, and vowing to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and fight against all actions and words that contradict Mao Zedong Thought.

The workers who were deceived in the early stages of the movement also raised their awareness through this great criticism. They recognized the evil of the reactionary bourgeois line and flocked to the revolutionary faction.

In this revolutionary great criticism, the factory revolutionary committee and the proletarian revolutionaries further implemented the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves. With differing opinions, they engaged in debate and studied Chairman Mao's works, clarified right and wrong, and solidly purged the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line promoted by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

The workers of this factory believe that the process of this great criticism is the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking down bourgeois ideology, and establishing the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They let the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought take root among the workers, turning the factory into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Through this revolutionary great criticism, the revolutionary consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers has greatly increased, and their enthusiasm for production has soared. They improved the production process, enhanced product quality, significantly reduced production time, and increased output.

    坚持斗争大方向　狠抓本厂斗批改
    上海油墨厂革命群众深入扎实地肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义流毒
    据新华社上海六日电  上海油墨厂无产阶级革命派和革命群众在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的关键时刻，把革命的大批判和本厂的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，使革命的大批判更加深入、更加扎实，使本厂的斗、批、改提到更高的水平。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在大批判前，就揭露出工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派向资产阶级妥协投降的大量罪行。工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派重用、依靠资本家，使工厂不少权力掌握在资本家及其代理人手里。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派经常宣扬资本家在管理、技术上“有一套”。无耻地要党员干部“多关心资本家”，甚至打算培养资本家入党。在工厂党内走资本主义道路当权派的重用、提拔下，从厂一级到科室、车间一级，资本家都占据了重要的领导位置，掌握大权。工人出身的干部受到排挤，在许多方面，工人群众实际上失去了发言权。
    因此，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派伙同资本家，在工厂经营管理上推行了一套资本主义的经营管理方式和资产阶级反动路线，实行资产阶级专政。
    在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的庇护下，工厂里的资本家气焰非常嚣张。
    在这次大批判中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工把工厂党内走资本主义道路当权派和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在这方面的反动言行联系起来批判。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派无耻地颂扬资本家“剥削有功”，“资本家能干”，叫嚣要“使资本家管理工厂”，要工人和干部“向资本家学习”，这和本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、资本家唱一个调子。职工们说：工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是厂内资本家的后台，是厂内资产阶级的代理人，他要在工厂里搞资本主义复辟；党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是全国所有资本家的总后台，是全国资产阶级在党内最大的代理人，他要把我们整个社会主义国家变成资本主义国家，把我们劳动人民拉回到受剥削受迫害的老路上去。广大革命职工从工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，看到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的更大危害；从原来只知道仇恨工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，进一步到仇恨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。他们说：修正主义的总后台是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，他的黑手伸到了我们厂里。我们必须挖掉总后台，斩断其黑手，使我们的国家永不变色。
    在大批判中，无产阶级革命派和革命职工的觉悟进一步提高了，更深入地揭发出工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派重用资本家、培养资产阶级接班人、培植亲信等方面的新问题。他们揭露出在生产技术管理上，工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，根本不信任工人群众，身在生产第一线的工人群众没有发言权。现在，他们冲破了这些束缚工人手脚的旧的规章制度，大大调动了工人群众的生产积极性和创造性。
    在大批判中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线得到了进一步的贯彻。运动中一些犯过错误的干部不敢起来革命，怕群众不相信。少数职工也有顾虑。针对这些活思想，这个厂的革命委员会召开了一些会，批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，揭露斗争工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。通过大批判，无产阶级革命派和革命职工更自觉地贯彻了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，主动帮助和鼓励犯过错误的干部起来“亮相”，造党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。
    在这次运动中犯了错误的干部，在大批判中争着发言，起来揭露工厂党内走资本主义道路当权派和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，愤怒控诉《修养》对自己的毒害，表示今后一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，和一切违反毛泽东思想的言行作不调和的斗争。
    在运动初期受蒙蔽的职工，通过这次大批判，也提高了觉悟。他们认识到资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，纷纷向革命派靠拢。
    在这场革命的大批判中，厂革命委员会和无产阶级革命派进一步贯彻了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。有不同意见，经过辩论和学习毛主席著作，弄清是非，扎扎实实地肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所推行的资产阶级反动路线的流毒。
    这个厂的职工认为：这场大批判的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，是大破资产阶级思想，大立光焰无际的毛泽东思想的过程，让光芒万丈的毛泽东思想在职工中扎下根，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    广大革命职工经过这场革命的大批判，革命觉悟大大提高，生产热情更加高涨。他们改进了生产工艺，提高了产品的质量，生产工时比过去大大缩减，产量大大增加。
