The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly protests the vile actions of the Bulgarian government that worsen relations between the two countries. The Bulgarian revisionist clique, acting as a clown for Soviet revisionism in opposing China, will not have a good ending. The Bulgarian authorities' unreasonable declaration that three of our students are "unwelcome" is an intentional act of sabotage against the agreement on exchange of students between the two countries out of fear of the truth.

	BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China handed over a note to the Bulgarian Embassy in China on June 10, strongly protesting the Bulgarian government's rude violation of the agreement on exchange of students between China and Bulgaria, its deliberate worsening of relations between the two countries, and its unreasonable declaration that three of our students in Bulgaria are "unwelcome." The note also strongly protests the vicious attacks by the Bulgarian revisionist leadership against the great leader of the Chinese people, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao.

	The note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said that on May 29, 1967, the Second Secretary of the Fifth Bureau of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Marinov, summoned the Second Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Bulgaria, Wang Mingxiu, and under the pretext that three Chinese students in Bulgaria had published an article in the "Red Guards" newspaper of the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute on February 21 criticizing Bulgaria and that China had "in fact expelled Bulgarian students," declared that if the three Chinese students returned to Bulgaria, they would be "unwelcome." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly protests this serious incident in which the Bulgarian government unilaterally and rudely violated the agreement on exchange of students between China and Bulgaria and deliberately worsened relations between the two countries.

	The note said that the Chinese students, out of a goodwill to promote friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Bulgaria, introduced in the newspaper of a revolutionary mass organization the true situation of the Bulgarian people's praise for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and their love for Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, as well as exposed the evil deeds of the Bulgarian revisionist leadership in every possible way to obstruct and block the Bulgarian people from knowing about China. This is a just and revolutionary action that fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the peoples of China and Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarian government said that such actions by our students are "opposing Bulgaria" and used this as an excuse to declare our students "unwelcome." This is a complete distortion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white, and is completely untenable. It only shows that you are afraid of the truth, afraid of the great thought of Mao Zedong, afraid of our great proletarian cultural revolution, and afraid of your people rising up to rebel against revisionism. It also shows that you are trying to use fabricated charges to unilaterally tear up the agreement on mutual exchange of students between the two countries and cut off the right of our students to continue their studies in Bulgaria. This is another serious step taken by you to deliberately worsen relations between China and Bulgaria.

	The note said that you claim that China has "expelled" Bulgarian students, which is completely untrue. Everyone knows that China is currently carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and all colleges and universities have suspended classes. All foreign students in China have also suspended their studies, and Bulgarian students are no exception. Now you say that China has "expelled" Bulgarian students, which is a complete fabrication out of thin air. Your purpose is to try to shift the responsibility for violating the agreement on exchange of students between China and Bulgaria to the Chinese side, which is absolutely unacceptable.

	It must be pointed out that your arbitrary violation of the agreement between the two countries and the declaration that three of our students are "unwelcome" is not accidental. This is inseparable from your consistent following of Soviet revisionism in opposing China and worsening relations between China and Bulgaria. Since the beginning of our cultural revolution, your newspapers have published a large number of anti-China articles, viciously attacking and slandering our domestic and foreign policies and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. What is particularly infuriating is that your Politburo members and other party, government, and military leaders have publicly and viciously attacked the great leader of the Chinese people, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, by name on many occasions. We have strongly protested against your vicious behavior many times, but you have ignored our protests and continued to publish articles and news attacking Chairman Mao. We strongly protest against this.

	The note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China pointed out that recently, you have also taken a series of serious steps to worsen relations between the two countries. We must warn you that the Zhivkov revisionist leadership of Bulgaria has gone very far on the road of opposing China. If you continue to act as a clown for Soviet revisionism in opposing China, disregard the friendship between the peoples of China and Bulgaria, and insist on being an enemy of the 700 million Chinese people, you will definitely not have a good ending.

    我外交部强烈抗议保政府恶化两国关系的卑劣行径
    保修集团充当苏修反华小丑绝没有好下场
    保当局无理宣布我三名留学生为“不受欢迎的人”，是害怕真理蓄意破坏两国交换留学生的协议
    新华社十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十日交给保加利亚驻华大使馆一份照会，强烈抗议保加利亚政府粗暴破坏中保两国交换留学生协议，蓄意恶化两国关系，无理宣布我三名留保学生为“不受欢迎的人”。照会并就保加利亚修正主义领导集团恶毒攻击我国人民的伟大领袖、我们心中的红太阳毛主席提出最强烈的抗议。
    我国外交部的照会说，一九六七年五日二十九日，保加利亚外交部第五司二等秘书马林诺夫约见中华人民共和国驻保加利亚大使馆二等秘书王明修，借口三名中国留保学生今年二月二十一日在北京外国语学院《红卫报》上发表所谓“反对保加利亚”文章和中国“事实上已将保留华学生赶走”，宣布我三名留保学生如再来保，将是“不受欢迎的人”。我国外交部对保加利亚政府这一片面粗暴地破坏中保两国交换留学生协议、恶化中保两国关系的严重事件，提出强烈抗议。
    照会说，中国留学生从增进中保两国人民友谊和相互了解的良好愿望出发，在革命群众组织的小报上介绍保加利亚人民赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命和热爱中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的真实情况，以及揭露保加利亚修正主义领导集团百般阻挠和封锁保加利亚人民了解中国情况的恶劣行径，这是正当的、革命的行动，是完全符合中保两国人民的根本利益的。而保加利亚政府竟说我留学生这样做是“反对保加利亚”，并以此为借口宣布我留学生为“不受欢迎的人”。这完全是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，是根本站不住脚的。它只能说明你们害怕真理，害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，害怕我国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，害怕你们的人民起来造修正主义的反。它还说明你们妄图用莫须有的罪名，片面撕毁两国互派留学生的协议，中断我留学生在保继续学习的权利。这是保方蓄意恶化中保两国关系的又一严重步骤。
    照会说，你们说什么中国“赶走”保留学生，这是完全不符合事实的。大家都知道，中国正在开展无产阶级文化大革命，高等学校已全部停课，所有在中国的外国留学生也都休学，保加利亚的留学生当然也不能例外。现在你们却说中国把保加利亚留学生“赶走”，这完全是无中生有的捏造，其目的就是想把破坏中保交换留学生协议的责任强加在中国方面，这是绝对办不到的。
    必须指出，你们肆意破坏两国协议，宣布我三名留学生为“不受欢迎的人”，绝不是偶然的。这同你们一贯追随苏修反华，恶化中保两国关系是分不开的。自从我国文化大革命以来，你们的报刊发表了大量的反华文章，对我国的内外政策和文化大革命进行了恶毒的攻击和诬蔑，尤其令人愤慨的是你们的政治局委员和党政军其他负责人多次公开指名恶毒攻击我国人民的伟大领袖、我们心中的红太阳毛主席。我们对你们这种恶劣的行为曾多次提出抗议，但是你们置若罔闻，继续发表攻击毛主席的文章和消息，对此我们向你们提出最强烈的抗议。
    我国外交部的照会提出，最近，你们还采取了一系列恶化两国关系的严重步骤。我们要正告你们，保加利亚日夫科夫修正主义领导集团在反华的道路上已经走得很远了，你们如果继续充当苏修的反华小丑，不顾中保两国人民的友谊，坚持与七亿中国人民为敌，是绝对不会有好下场的。
