The heads of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership, Johnson and Kosygin, held a secret meeting for over five hours on the 23rd in the U.S. town of Glassboro. On the 25th, they continued their "in-depth" secret talks for nearly five hours in a house named Hollybush, further plotting their counter-revolutionary global collaboration.

Johnson was highly satisfied with the Soviet revisionists' intensified betrayal of the interests of the world's revolutionary people. After the meeting, he enthusiastically declared that it was an "important and historic meeting," and he vigorously promoted the so-called "Hollybush spirit." Kosygin, full of traitorous spirit, emphasized that the talks were "beneficial," and he hoped that the U.S. and the Soviet Union would "move forward together for peace." Representatives of U.S. monopolies in Congress responded quickly and "enthusiastically" to this meeting. Senate Democratic leader Mansfield said he believed that the Glassboro talks had "laid the foundation for future changes on substantive issues." Other prominent figures from the Democratic and Republican parties also praised the talks as "very helpful," expressing their "relief" and "joy." Western newspapers, in commenting on this meeting, which was "filled with an extremely harmonious atmosphere from beginning to end," boasted that through the two meetings, a "special relationship" between the Soviet Union and the U.S. had been formed, and "another stage of gradually improving U.S.-Soviet relations had begun in Glassboro."

After a round of flirting on the 23rd, Kosygin and Johnson met on the 25th and became even more intimate. To facilitate the counter-revolutionary global deal and strengthen the atmosphere of intimacy between them, Kosygin, following in Khrushchev's footsteps, engaged in "family diplomacy," bringing his daughter to the meeting site. Johnson also brought his wife and daughter. Western news agencies described this as creating a "family reunion scene" and a "family atmosphere." Kosygin, upon stepping out of the car on the 25th, greeted Johnson with a broad smile and a warm handshake, shamelessly flattering, "I am already very accustomed to this place, coming here is like coming home." He then introduced his daughter to Johnson and U.S. officials, and Johnson introduced his wife and daughter to Kosygin. After that, Kosygin and Johnson, along with their five family members, posed for a "family-style" photo with smiles on their faces. Johnson's wife and daughter also gave Kosygin's daughter an antique mirror, a gold watch, and other gifts. Previously, Kosygin had given Johnson a new grandchild a gold "baby cup." This nauseating flattery made even some Western news agencies marvel. The DPA reported: "The two leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union reached such an intimate state in such a short time, which is really surprising."

The same personnel who participated in the 23rd meeting attended the 25th meeting; however, the U.S. side notably added Harriman, the U.S. President's roving ambassador, who is specially responsible for colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership and playing the "peace talks" trick in the Vietnam issue. They, along with Johnson and Kosygin, conducted approximately one hour of "substantive talks" over lunch, after which Johnson and Kosygin had a three-hour private discussion with only interpreters present.

After the meeting, Johnson and Kosygin issued statements in Washington and New York, respectively. Kosygin also held a press conference at the United Nations. The statements from both sides and the initial information revealed indicate that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionist leaders, through "in-depth discussions" and "open and frank exchanges of views," had made some dirty political deals in these two black meetings, further strengthening their global counter-revolutionary collusion against China, against communism, against the people, and against revolution.

Johnson, in his statement after returning to the White House following the talks, said that through the two Hollybush meetings, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had made "great progress" in "reducing misunderstandings" and "reaffirming our common commitment to seeking agreements." He also said that through the talks, he and Kosygin had "gained a new understanding of each other," and that differences and difficulties between the U.S. and the Soviet Union would decrease rather than increase in the future. He announced that he had agreed with Kosygin that after Kosygin's return to his country, Gromyko and Rusk would continue negotiations in New York. In addition, the leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union would maintain contact through "ministers and ambassadors" and maintain direct contact. Later, Kosygin's remarks at the press conference also indicated that through these two talks, both sides had made significant progress in strengthening counter-revolutionary collusion, saying that the talks had reached a basic agreement on issues of common cooperation that both sides considered beneficial.

The tightening of U.S.-Soviet collusion against China was an important content of the Hollybush black meeting, and the discussion of the so-called nuclear disarmament issue was directly aimed at China. Kosygin's public criticism of China's nuclear tests at the press conference clearly illustrated this point. This traitor to the world's revolutionary people shamelessly attacked socialist China for developing its own nuclear weapons, saying that the Soviet Union opposed any nuclear explosions and that China "should" adhere to the fraudulent Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed by the U.S., the Soviet Union, and the UK. Johnson and Kosygin had repeatedly indicated after the two meetings that, to maintain their nuclear monopoly and deal with China, they had accelerated their collusion on this issue and had reached a "basic agreement" on the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty," which would be finalized at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and had also conducted further exploration on the issue of establishing an "anti-ballistic missile system."

After Kosygin and Johnson completed this unprecedentedly brazen and extensive dirty deal in Hollybush, they were guilty and held a special press conference at the United Nations building on the 25th. At the conference, he put on a show of "anti-imperialism" to cover up the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the world's people. It was this same Kosygin who, just a few hours earlier, was shaking hands and chatting with the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, now hypocritically "condemning" Israel and the U.S. for invading Arab countries. However, his act could not conceal the fact that at the Hollybush black meeting, Kosygin continued to trade the interests of the Arab people with the U.S. Johnson's statement after the meeting made it clear: the U.S. and the Soviet Union had "found several common factors in the Middle East issue." He emphasized that the U.S. and the Soviet Union had agreed on issues such as recognizing Israel's "right to exist," the need to end the Middle East war, and the so-called "in appropriate circumstances, Israeli troops must withdraw." Kosygin's remarks at the press conference also confirmed this. While he was putting on a show of "condemning" Israel and expressing "support" for Arab countries, he advocated: "To withdraw (Israeli) troops, and then let the Security Council consider all other issues in the Middle East." This essentially endorsed the U.S.'s demand for the Arab people to surrender under the pretext of "conditional withdrawal," laying the groundwork for forcing Arab countries to accept humiliating withdrawal terms in the future.

On the Vietnam issue, Kosygin also followed the same pattern of "condemnation." However, various signs indicated that the tightening of U.S.-Soviet collusion to plot new tricks to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. and for national liberation was one of the main contents of his two black meetings with Johnson. McNamara's postponement of his originally scheduled trip to South Vietnam to attend the Hollybush meeting, and the participation of "peace talks" trickster Harriman in the secret talks on the 25th, all indicated this. The U.S. news agency, in reporting Harriman's appearance, said: "This indicates that Johnson is prepared to conduct a thorough review of the entire situation in Vietnam." The news also quoted a Soviet source in New York as saying: "Kosygin is particularly concerned about finding a way out of the dead end in Southeast Asia." In his statement at the White House on the 25th, Johnson again hinted that the U.S. planned to collaborate with the Soviet revisionist leadership to play the "peace talks" trick again. He threatened: "For every step others may take towards peace, we will take reciprocal steps, we will take steps beyond that."

After completing his dirty mission, Kosygin left the U.S. at noon on the 26th to go to Cuba. At the press conference, he announced that he would also visit other countries on his way back to his country.

    美帝苏修头目谈得投契打得火热
    柯西金再次拜见约翰逊时竟无耻地说：“我来这里就象回家一样” 约翰逊宣扬美苏会谈在加紧反革命勾结方面“取得了巨大进展”
    新华社二十六日讯  美帝国主义头子约翰逊同苏联修正主义领导集团头目柯西金二十三日在美国的葛拉斯堡罗密谈五个多小时以后，二十五日继续在那所名为霍利布什的房子里举行了将近五个小时的“更深入的”秘密会谈，再接再厉地策划美苏的反革命全球性大勾结。
    约翰逊对苏修加紧叛卖世界人民革命利益的行径非常满意。他在会后兴高采烈地宣称，这是一次“重要的、具有历史意义的会议”，并且大肆鼓吹要发扬所谓“霍利布什精神”。柯西金则叛徒气十足地强调说，会谈是“有益的”，他希望美苏“为和平共同前进”。美国垄断资本在国会中的代表人物对这次会谈作出了迅速的、“热情的”反应。参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德说，他认为，霍利布什会谈“已经为未来在实质性问题上的变化奠定了基础”。民主党和共和党的其他若干头面人物也纷纷赞扬这次会谈“很有帮助”，他们“很放心”、“很高兴”。西方报刊在评论这次“自始至终充满着极其融洽的气氛”的会谈时，更是大吹大擂地宣称，通过两次会谈，苏美“‘特殊关系’已经形成”，“逐步改善美苏关系的另一个阶段，已经在葛拉斯堡罗开始”。
    经过二十三日的一番勾搭后，柯西金和约翰逊在二十五日会见时打得更加火热。为了促成反革命的全球交易，加强彼此间的亲密气氛，柯西金继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，大搞“家庭外交”，他特地把他的女儿带到了会谈地点。约翰逊也带上了他的老婆和女儿。西方通讯社描绘说，这使这次会见充满了“家人团聚的景象”和“家庭气氛”。柯西金二十五日一下汽车就满脸堆笑，同约翰逊热烈握手寒暄，他恬不知耻地讨好说：“我已经很习惯于这个地方了，来这里就象回家一样。”接着，柯西金把他的女儿介绍给约翰逊和美国官员，约翰逊也把他的老婆和女儿介绍给柯西金。然后，柯西金和约翰逊这两家五口人就“满面笑容”地让记者给他们拍了“一张家庭式的合照”。约翰逊的妻子和女儿还送给柯西金的女儿一面古镜、一只金表和其他礼物。在这以前，柯西金送给约翰逊新添的外孙一只金制的“婴儿杯”。这种肉麻的勾搭，使一些西方通讯社也叹为观止。德新社在一条消息中写道：美苏两国首脑在这样短的时间内居然达到了“这种亲密状态”，实在使人“感到惊奇”。
    双方参加过二十三日会谈的人员再次参加了二十五日的会谈；但是美国方面引人注目地增加了一个专门负责同苏修领导集团勾结，在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”阴谋的美国总统巡回大使哈里曼。他们同约翰逊、柯西金一起，在午餐席上进行了约一个钟头的“实质性会谈”，之后，约翰逊同柯西金进行了三个多小时的只有译员参加的单独会谈。
    会谈结束后，约翰逊和柯西金分别在华盛顿和纽约发表了声明，柯西金还在联合国举行记者招待会。双方的声明和各方面初步透露出来的情况表明，美帝和苏修头目在这两次黑会中，通过“深入地讨论”和“开诚布公的交换意见”，已经作成了一些肮脏的政治交易，进一步加强了他们反华、反共、反人民、反革命的全球性的勾结。
    约翰逊在会谈结束回到白宫后发表的声明中说，通过霍利布什这两次会谈，美苏之间“在减少误解方面，以及在重申我们共同致力于谋求协议方面，我们取得了巨大进展。”他还说，通过会谈，他同柯西金“彼此有了新的了解”，今后美苏之间的“分歧和困难将会减少而不会增加”。他宣布，他已同柯西金商定，柯西金回国后，葛罗米柯同腊斯克将继续在纽约进行谈判。此外，美苏两国领导人今后还将通过“部长们、大使们保持接触，并保持直接的接触”。稍后，柯西金在记者招待会上的谈话也表明，通过这两次会谈，双方在加强反革命的勾结方面取得了明显的进展，他说，会谈就“双方都认为是有益的”美苏共同合作的问题达成了基本协议。
    美苏加紧勾结反对中国，是霍利布什黑会的重要内容，而讨论所谓“核裁军”问题，其矛头更是直接针对中国的。柯西金在记者招待会上公然攻击中国进行核试验就清楚地说明了这一点。这个世界革命人民的叛徒在答记者问时，放肆地攻击社会主义中国不该发展自己的核武器，说什么苏联反对任何核爆炸，中国“应该”遵守欺世惑众的苏美英三国部分禁止核试验条约。约翰逊和柯西金在两次会谈后已经一再表明，为了保持美苏核垄断地位，对付中国，他们已经加快了在这个问题上勾结的步调，在所谓“防止核扩散条约”问题上已经达成了“基本协议”，即将在日内瓦裁军会议上拍板成交，在建立“反弹道导弹系统”问题上，双方也进行了进一步的探索。
    柯西金同约翰逊在霍利布什作了这场空前露骨、空前广泛的肮脏交易以后，作贼心虚，二十五日在联合国大厦专门举行了一次记者招待会，会上，他打起精神，装出一副“反帝”姿态，企图掩饰苏修领导集团叛卖世界人民的丑恶嘴脸。就是这个柯西金，几小时以前还在同美帝头子约翰逊握手言欢，这时候却假惺惺地“谴责”以色列和美国侵略阿拉伯国家。但是，他的这番做作，毕竟无法掩盖这一事实：在霍利布什黑会上，柯西金继续拿阿拉伯人民的利益同美国作交易。约翰逊在会后发表的声明中说得很清楚：美苏在中东问题上已“找到共同基础的若干因素”。他强调美苏在承认以色列“有权生存”，“中东战争必须结束”，以及所谓“在确当的情况下（以色列）军队必须撤退”等问题上，双方意见“一致”。而柯西金自己在记者招待会上的谈话实际上也证实了这一点。他在装腔作势地“谴责”以色列、表示“支持”阿拉伯国家的同时，鼓吹：“促使（以色列）军队撤退，然后再让安理会来考虑中东其他一切问题”。这实质上是附和了美国要阿拉伯人民投降的“有条件撤军”的主张，为以后迫使阿拉伯国家接受屈辱的撤军条件埋下了伏笔。
    在越南问题上，柯西金也如法炮制地“谴责”了一番美国。但是，种种迹象表明，美苏加紧勾结策划新的阴谋来扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火，正是他同约翰逊两次黑会的主要内容之一。麦克纳马拉推迟他原定的南越之行，出席霍利布什会议，以及“和谈”骗局“专家”哈里曼二十五日的一度参加密谈，就都表明了这一点。美国通讯社在报道哈里曼露面的消息时说：“这表明，约翰逊准备对整个越南局势作一番彻底的回顾。”消息还引在纽约的苏联人士的话说：“柯西金对于从东南亚的死胡同中找到一条出路特别感到关切”。约翰逊二十五日在白宫发表的声明中还再次暗示，美国打算伙同苏修领导集团再次玩弄诱“和”骗局。他扬言：“对于别人可能准备采取的走向和平的每一个步骤，我们将采取对等的步骤、我们将采取超越的步骤”。
    柯西金在完成了他的这次肮脏使命之后，已经在二十六日中午离开美国前去古巴。他在记者招待会上曾经宣布，他在回国途中还将去其他一些国家活动。
