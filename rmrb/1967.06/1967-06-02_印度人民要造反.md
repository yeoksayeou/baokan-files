The winding Ganges flows with the blood and tears of the Indian people, and the fertile Ganges Plain is soaked with the sweat of the Indian working masses.

Beautiful rivers and mountains, but wolves are in charge. On this land of more than 2.9 million square kilometers, the imperialist bandits plunder endlessly, and the domestic reactionaries exploit and oppress heavily. The Indian people are in dire straits, struggling on the brink of death.

Today's India! The sky is dark, and the earth is dark.

Where is India heading? What is India's way out? Who should hold India's destiny?

Should we place our hopes in the thoroughly reactionary Indian government? No! Absolutely not! It is this government that colludes with imperialism and modern revisionism, selling out India's beautiful rivers and mountains, exploiting and oppressing the hardworking Indian people; it is this government that allows the monopoly capitalist group, the Birla family, to increase their assets by nearly half in four years.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "In economically backward, semi-colonial China, the landlord class and the comprador class are completely appendages of international capitalism, their existence and development are dependent on imperialism. These classes represent China's most backward and most reactionary production relations, obstructing the development of China's productive forces. They are completely incompatible with the goals of the Chinese revolution. Especially the big landlord class and the big comprador class, they always stand on the side of imperialism, and are extreme counter-revolutionaries."

Today's Indian government is precisely this extreme counter-revolutionary force. To beg for a half-bowl of leftovers from their masters to maintain their reactionary rule, they do not hesitate to kneel before the Americans and the Soviet revisionists, selling out national interests, and levying heavy taxes and oppressing the broad Indian working masses.

Such dark, corrupt, and reactionary rule is the root cause of the Indian people's oppression and exploitation, and their impoverished lives. Such a reactionary government is the enemy of the Indian people; how can we expect it to save India?

Should we place our hopes in the "aid" from the U.S. and the Soviet Union? No! The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are of the same ilk as the Indian reactionaries. Under the banner of "aid," they control India politically and plunder it economically, helping the Indian reactionary government to carry out anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. Their wolfish ambitions are blatant.

Today's India is precisely the showcase of so-called "U.S.-Soviet cooperation"! From India's present, one can see what the result of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation ruling the world" would be!

Should we place our hopes in "parliamentary struggle" and "legal struggle"? No! Absolutely not! The parliamentary struggle advocated by revisionism is essentially to keep the people oppressed for generations and to oppose the people's revolution. In capitalist countries, the parliament is merely a decoration and a screen for the bourgeoisie's rule. The Soviet revisionists' running dogs in India, the Danesh Dange traitor clique, advocate winning victory through parliamentary struggle, advocate "peaceful transition" to socialism, and advocate establishing a "non-Congress" government through elections to "ensure a better future and a happier life for the people." All this is opium for the people, deceiving the masses! This is to help the Indian authorities maintain reactionary rule, and it is an attempt to seduce the Indian people into giving up revolutionary struggle, so as to serve the Indian reactionary government.

Chairman Mao says: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist principle of revolution is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." Chairman Mao's teachings are unshakable truths.

The Indian people must rise up in rebellion, must struggle, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, use the gun to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, drive out all imperialist bandits, seize power, and only then will there be a way out.

We believe that the Indian people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will not sit idly by, will not kneel down and beg for life. Hunger and poverty have driven the Indian people to the brink. Some have already risen up in rebellion! Indian workers, peasants, students, and police have all taken to the streets to fight for survival and against tyranny. They go on strike, boycott classes, demonstrate, and even seize grain and revolt.

The Ganges is roaring! India is boiling! The revolutionary flames of the proletariat will surely burn across the land of India!

    印度人民要造反 
    北京地质学院东方红公社　觅真
    蜿蜒的恒河流着印度人民的血泪，肥沃的恒河平原洒尽了印度劳苦大众的汗水。
    大好河山，豺狼当道。在这二百九十多万平方公里的土地上，帝国主义强盗无休止的掠夺，国内反动派的重重剥削压榨，印度人民处在水深火热之中，挣扎在死亡线上。
    今天的印度啊！天是黑沉沉的天，地是黑沉沉的地。
    印度向何处去？印度的出路在哪里？印度的命运应该由谁来掌握？
    把希望寄托在反动透顶的印度政府吗？不能！绝对不能！正是这个政府勾结帝国主义和现代修正主义，出卖印度的大好河山，剥削压榨勤劳的印度人民；正是这个政府，让垄断资本集团比拉家族的资产四年增加近一半。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“在经济落后的半殖民地的中国，地主阶级和买办阶级完全是国际资产阶级的附庸，其生存和发展，是附属于帝国主义的。这些阶级代表中国最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍中国生产力的发展。他们和中国革命的目的完全不相容。特别是大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。”
    今天的印度政府正是这种极端的反革命派。它为了向主子讨得半碗残羹剩饭维持住反动统治，不惜双膝跪在美帝和苏修面前，出卖民族的利益，而对印度广大劳动人民横征暴敛，残酷镇压。
    这样黑暗、腐败、反动的统治，是印度人民受压迫受剥削、生活贫困的祸根。这样的反动政府是印度人民的敌人，怎么能希望它来救印度呢？
    把希望寄托在美、苏的“援助”吗？不能！美帝苏修和印度反动派是一丘之貉，它们的“援助”是强盗的“好心”。它们打着“援助”的旗号，干的是在政治上控制印度，经济上掠夺印度，帮助印度反动政府反共、反人民、反革命的勾当。它们的狼子野心，露骨得很。
    今天的印度，正是所谓“美苏合作”的样板！人们从印度的今天可以看到“美苏合作主宰世界”的结果是什么！
    把希望寄托在“议会斗争”、“合法斗争”上吗？不行！根本不行！修正主义大肆宣扬的议会斗争，实质上是要人民世代受压迫，反对人民起来革命。在资本主义国家里，议会只不过是资产阶级统治的装饰品和屏风而已。苏修在印度的走狗丹吉叛徒集团大肆鼓吹通过议会斗争获得胜利，鼓吹“和平过渡”到社会主义，鼓吹什么要通过选举建立“非国大党”的政府来“保证人民有更好的前途，更幸福的生活”。这统统是麻醉人民的鸦片，欺骗群众的鬼话！这是帮助印度当局维持反动统治，这是妄图诱骗印度人民放弃革命斗争，以便为印度反动政府效劳。
    毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”毛主席的教导是颠扑不破的真理。
    印度人民只有起来造反，起来斗争，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，用枪杆子推翻反动的统治阶级，赶走一切帝国主义强盗，夺取政权，才有出路。
    我们相信，有着反帝斗争光荣革命传统的印度人民，是决不会坐以待毙，决不会跪着求生的。饥饿、贫困已经把印度人民逼上了梁山。他们有的已经起来造反了！印度的工人、农民、学生、警察已纷纷展开争生存反暴政的斗争。他们罢工、罢课、示威，甚至抢粮、暴动。
    恒河在咆哮！印度在沸腾！无产阶级的革命的熊熊烈火，必将在印度的大地上燃烧起来！
