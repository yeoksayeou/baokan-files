The moment guns started firing in the Middle East, the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership group was exposed in its nakedness, betraying the Arab people.

The Soviet revisionist group has always pretended to be friends of the Arab people. However, after the U.S. imperialist's running dog, Israel, launched an armed invasion against the Arab countries, they not only did not take action to support the Arab countries in counterattacking the invasion, but instead rushed out to issue a statement, attempting to suppress the Arab people's just struggle against the invasion. The Soviet revisionist traitors have completely revealed their true colors as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

It is well known that Israel is a tool of U.S. imperialism in invading Arab countries. The armed attack launched by Israel against the Arab countries is entirely manufactured by U.S. imperialism. However, in the statement issued by the Soviet revisionist group on the sixth, they did not condemn U.S. imperialism as the chief culprit of this war of aggression against the Arab countries, but instead proposed that so-called "other governments, including major powers," should "extinguish the fire in the Near East." The major powers in the eyes of the Soviet revisionist group are not the U.S. and British imperialists who ordered Israel to launch the war of aggression? The Soviet revisionist group actually advocates that the arsonists in the Middle East should be the ones to put out the fire, which is utterly absurd. What else is this if not an attempt to exonerate U.S. and British imperialism?

The absurd proposition of the Soviet revisionist group thoroughly exposes their disregard for the Arab countries and the Arab people, and their desire for a few so-called major powers, specifically the U.S. and the Soviet Union, to dominate Middle Eastern affairs and manipulate the fate of the Arab people. The Soviet revisionist group's declaration that the United Nations should "immediately take necessary measures to restore peace in the Near East" is driven by such a despicable motive. The United Nations has long been a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression and a political marketplace for the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist group's advocacy for United Nations intervention is nothing more than a cover-up for U.S. imperialism, allowing the U.S. and the Soviet Union to jointly promote "hegemony politics" and extinguish the anti-imperialist flames of the Arab people. This is a great conspiracy to betray the Arab people.

Now, it is even clearer that Israel's armed invasion of the Arab countries is not only directly ordered by U.S. and British imperialism but is also encouraged and supported by the Soviet revisionist group. They want to use Israel's armed attack to pave the way for major powers to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. Before June 5, the Soviet revisionists were secretly colluding with U.S. and British imperialism, and now they are about to take joint public action. The Soviet revisionist group's statement is a signal.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The jackals of imperialism should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of mankind and arbitrarily carve up Asian and African countries has passed and will not return." The Arab people are a heroic people, and they will not be manipulated by others. Now, the heroic Arab people have raised the banner of just struggle against the U.S. imperialist's war of aggression and its running dog, Israel. As long as they strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will surely achieve final victory. The Soviet revisionist group, in cahoots with U.S. and British imperialism, attempts to sabotage the Arab people's anti-imperialist just cause and will surely meet a bad end.

    美帝帮凶现原形
    本报评论员
    中东的枪声一响，苏修领导集团背叛阿拉伯人民的丑恶面目就赤裸裸地暴露了出来。
    苏修集团一直假装是阿拉伯人民的朋友。但是，在美帝国主义的走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家发动了武装侵略以后，他们不仅不采取行动支持阿拉伯各国反击侵略，反而急忙跳出来发表一个声明，力图把阿拉伯人民反侵略的正义斗争压下去。苏修叛徒们完全现出了他们充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的原形。
    人所共知，以色列是美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的工具。以色列对阿拉伯国家发动的武装进攻，完全是美帝国主义一手制造的。然而，苏修集团在六日发表的声明中，却根本不谴责美帝国主义是这次侵略阿拉伯国家的战争的罪魁祸首，而提出什么由所谓“包括大国在内的其他国家政府”来“熄灭近东的战火”。苏修集团眼里的所谓大国，不就是指使以色列发动侵略战争的美英帝国主义吗？苏修集团居然主张在中东的放火犯来救火，真是岂有此理到了极点。这不是为美英帝国主义开脱罪责又是什么呢？
    苏修集团的这种荒谬主张，彻底暴露了它根本不把阿拉伯国家和阿拉伯人民放在眼里，妄想由少数所谓大国，具体说来就是美苏两国，来主宰中东的事务，摆布阿拉伯人民的命运。苏修集团在声明中大喊大叫要联合国“火速采取恢复近东和平所必要的措施”，也就是出于这样一种卑鄙的用心。联合国早就成为美帝国主义的侵略工具，同时也是美苏的政治交易所。苏修集团主张联合国进行干预，不过是替美帝国主义打掩护，由美苏合伙来推行“强权政治”，扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝怒火。这是出卖阿拉伯人民的一个大阴谋。
    现在，人们可以看得更加清楚，以色列对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略行动，不仅是受美英帝国主义直接指使的，同时也是受苏修集团所纵容和鼓励的。它们就是要利用以色列的武装进攻，来给大国干涉中东事务开路。六月五日以前，苏修同美英帝国主义是暗里合谋的，现在它们要公开采取联合行动了。苏修集团的声明，就是一个信号。
    毛主席曾经指出：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”阿拉伯人民是英雄的人民，他们是不会任人摆布的。现在，英雄的阿拉伯人民已经举起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略战争的正义旗帜。他们只要加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。苏修集团同美英帝国主义狼狈为奸，妄图破坏阿拉伯人民的反帝正义事业，一定没有好下场。
