According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia, through its puppet "Cooperative Parliament," passed an anti-China "resolution" on the 16th. This resolution maliciously slanders and defames the great People's Republic of China, openly threatening to completely destroy the relations between China and Indonesia, and intensifying anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

This "resolution" maliciously uses the derogatory term "Zhina" (a term used by imperialists and colonialists during their rule in Indonesia to insult the Chinese people) to refer to the great People's Republic of China, and demands "active and resolute measures" in China-Indonesia diplomatic relations, even suggesting the severance of diplomatic ties. The "resolution" also proposes to "intensify efforts" to expel overseas Chinese from the country, fabricating the false accusation that overseas Chinese are engaged in "subversive and inciting activities." It calls for "resolute steps" to be taken against overseas Chinese, meaning to further intensify the suppression and persecution of overseas Chinese.

To cover up the anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries, the "resolution" attacks China's exposure of the Indonesian reactionaries' pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China crimes. It attacks the just actions of the revolutionary masses in China denouncing the fascist regime in Indonesia's anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes. It slanders the just struggle of overseas Chinese in Indonesia against persecution.

    印尼反动派准备进一步反华排华
    御用“合作国会”通过决议叫嚣彻底破坏中国印尼两国关系
    据新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的御用工具——“合作国会”十六日通过反华“决议”，对伟大的中华人民共和国进行恶毒的诽谤和诬蔑，公开叫嚣要彻底破坏中国印尼两国关系。加紧反华排华。
    这个“决议”恶毒地沿用帝国主义和殖民主义者统治印尼时期用以侮辱中国人民的名称“支那”，把伟大的中华人民共和国叫作“支那人民共和国”，并且叫嚷要在中国印尼两国外交关系上“采取积极的和坚决的措施，必要时断绝外交关系。”“决议”还提出要“加紧努力”地驱逐华侨出境，并且凭空捏造出所谓华侨“进行颠覆、煽动活动”的罪名，叫嚷要对华侨“采取坚决步骤”，也就是说要更疯狂地镇压和迫害华侨。
    为了掩盖印尼反动派的反华排华罪行，“决议”攻击中国对印尼反动派的亲美联苏反华的罪行的揭露，攻击中国革命群众声讨印尼法西斯政权反华、排华的滔天罪行的正义行动，诬蔑在印尼的华侨进行的反迫害的正义斗争。
