	The world's people should unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The world's people must dare to fight, not fear sacrifices, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the monsters of the world will be swept from the face of the earth.

		From the "Statement in Support of the Congolese (Kinshasa) People in Their Struggle Against U.S. Aggression"
