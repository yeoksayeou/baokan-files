	New China News Agency, Khamkeut, June 19th — Lao People's Patriotic Front Central Committee General Secretary, Lao National United Government Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism, Kaysone Phomvihane, on the 19th, visited the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos. He represented the Lao People's Patriotic Front Central Committee, the Lao People's Liberation Army, and the Lao Women's Federation to warmly congratulate China on the successful test of its first hydrogen bomb. He pointed out: The success of China's hydrogen bomb test is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, another brilliant achievement of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and another great victory for the Chinese people in their efforts to strive for self-reliance and self-improvement.

	He said, China's first successful test of a hydrogen bomb was achieved during the Cultural Revolution, which shows that China's scientific and technological level has rapidly developed during the Cultural Revolution. This further encourages the Lao people to launch a people's war to deal a heavier blow to American imperialism and its lackeys, creating conditions for the liberation of the entire nation. Kaysone Phomvihane said, the strengthening of China's national defense is a powerful support for the peoples of all countries in their struggle for national liberation. The success of China's hydrogen bomb test makes China's national defense even stronger, which is of great significance to the victory of the anti-American struggle of the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world.

	Kaysone Phomvihane sincerely wished the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and achieve greater victories in socialist construction.

    中国的成就是对老挝人民反美斗争有力支持
    新华社康开十九日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣富米·冯维希，十九日到中国驻老挝经济文化代表团，代表老挝爱国战线党中央、老挝人民解放军、老挝妇女联合会，热烈祝贺中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功。他指出：中国氢弹试验的成功是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是中国无产阶级文化大革命的又一辉煌成果，也是中国人民奋发图强、自力更生的又一伟大胜利。
    他说，中国第一次成功地试验了氢弹，是在无产阶级文化大革命进行中取得的，这说明中国的科学技术水平在文化大革命中得到了迅速的发展。这更进一步鼓舞了老挝人民发动人民战争给予美帝国主义及其走狗更沉重的打击，为解放全国创造条件。富米·冯维希说，中国国防力量的强大是对世界各国人民争取民族解放的强有力的支持。中国氢弹试验成功，使中国的国防力量更加强大，这对中国人民和世界革命人民的反美斗争的胜利具有重要意义。
    富米·冯维希热忱地祝愿中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在社会主义建设中取得更大胜利。
