	Vietnamese People and Military Shoot Down Four Invading U.S. Aircraft

	The people and military of North Vietnam in Hai Phong City, Bac Bo Province, and the White Dragon Tail Island, shot down three invading American aggressor aircraft and captured a live American pilot on the morning of May 31.

	Lao Patriots Repel Enemy's New Offensive

	In the middle and lower regions of Laos, from early April to early May, the people and military bravely fought and repelled the second large-scale encroachment by the United States and its lackeys on the Xam Neua region of Xam Nua Province, killing 291 enemy soldiers and wounding 43.

	Colombian Workers Stage Continuous Strikes

	Colombian workers have recently held multiple strikes, demanding wage increases and payment of overdue wages to maintain a minimum standard of living.

	Due to the United States' suppression of coffee prices, Colombia's main export, coffee, is currently facing its worst crisis in twenty years. This has led to a continuous deterioration of Colombia's economic situation and a sharp rise in the cost of living for the working people. However, wages have not increased, making workers' lives extremely difficult and leading to frequent strikes.

	U.S. and Soviet Union Rush to Promote "Non-Proliferation" Deception

	The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are currently using the 17-nation "disarmament" conference to intensify the promotion of their jointly planned "non-proliferation treaty" deception.

	Both the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are eager to quickly concoct this treaty to maintain their nuclear monopoly and nuclear hegemony, realizing their dream of U.S.-Soviet domination of the world. The U.S. representative Foster advocated: "There is no more important issue facing the world than stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons." The Soviet revisionist representative Roshchin, in tandem with the U.S. imperialists, reiterated the cliché that concluding such a treaty will "open up prospects for comprehensive disarmament."
