The Shandong Provincial Production Command Department recently called on all localities to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher and thoroughly eliminate the revisionist poison in grain work. While completing the distribution and procurement of summer grain, a summer production upsurge should be launched.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Jinan on June 2, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Production Command Department recently convened a full provincial meeting on summer grain distribution and procurement. The meeting required all levels of revolutionary organizations, broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism high, thoroughly expose and criticize the capitalist roaders within the Party, including the top capitalist roader within the Party and a handful of capitalist roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee, for their reactionary bourgeois line in grain work. The meeting emphasized the need to firmly eliminate revisionist poison. While carrying out a thorough revolutionary criticism, the summer grain distribution and procurement work for this year should be done well.

The meeting specifically discussed and arranged the work of summer grain distribution, procurement, summer harvest, and summer planting. The meeting believed that doing a good job in this year's summer grain distribution and procurement is of great significance in ensuring the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, promoting summer production, achieving a bumper harvest for the whole year, and supporting the socialist construction of the country.

The meeting emphasized that raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasping the key of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and unswervingly implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in summer production, distribution, and procurement. The meeting required all localities to use revolution to direct summer grain distribution and procurement, to firmly grasp the general direction of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to thoroughly expose and criticize the crimes of a handful of big and small capitalist roaders within the Party in grain distribution and procurement work, such as opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, canceling the struggle of the proletariat against capitalist forces, and promoting material incentives and economism. They must eliminate revisionist poison to ensure that, in accordance with the Party's policies, summer grain distribution and procurement are done well. At the same time, all localities must be vigilant against the sabotage by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They must firmly rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary masses to do a good job in summer grain distribution and procurement.

The meeting proposed to seriously implement Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people" and the Party's policies. Policies should be handed over to the masses, democracy should be fully carried out, the mass line should be followed, and the masses should discuss and implement the procurement tasks according to the Party's policies.

The meeting also pointed out that in this summer's grain distribution and procurement work, both grain-deficient and grain-surplus units must seriously implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "frugality for revolution." They must truly achieve frugality in bumper harvests and frugality in increased production, and at the same time, they must seriously and comprehensively arrange for the living of the members.

The meeting required all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations to emphasize proletarian politics in summer distribution and procurement work, and to put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place. They must organize the broad masses of cadres and members to study the brilliant works of the "Three Old Articles," break down the "self" and establish the "public," promote the revolutionization of thought, grasp the revolution, and promote production. While completing the summer grain distribution and procurement work, a vigorous summer production upsurge should be launched.
