In the eve of the first anniversary of the nationwide first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster approved by our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University are enthusiastically carrying out the "three loyalties" activities: being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have resolved to raise higher the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, closely combine this great criticism and struggle with the struggle-criticism-transformation in their own unit, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

One year ago, Chairman Mao personally presided over the drafting of the great historical document, the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and then decided to publish on June 1 the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster of Peking University on the radio and in newspapers, igniting the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University have seriously studied the Notification and the five documents on literary issues published for the first time by Chairman Mao, with everyone's fighting spirit soaring and enthusiasm redoubled. The thick political atmosphere and festive mood fill the campus of Peking University. The freshly reprinted red May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster of Peking University are posted in the dining hall. Everywhere, big-character posters celebrating and commemorating "June 1" are posted. Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others said with boundless excitement: The May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, is a great Marxist-Leninist historical document. Our big-character poster was born under the inspiration of the Notification. Without the Notification, there would be no big-character poster. They called on the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University to study, apply, and propagate the May 16 Notification well, and initiated the "three loyalties" activities throughout the school. They hoped that everyone would take studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the guideline, recall bitterness and sweetness, further raise class consciousness, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, always follow Chairman Mao in revolution, and always follow the correct leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. The initiative of Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others expressed the hearts of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and was enthusiastically responded to throughout the school.

A new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, centered around the "three loyalties" activities, has risen in Peking University. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff are speaking out and applying, recalling and comparing, studying Chairman Mao's quotations, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously propagating the great practical and historical significance of the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Revolutionary teachers and students also went deep into factories and rural areas, together with revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, launching a barrage of criticism against China's Khrushchev.

Reviewing the glorious struggle course of the past year, the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University excitedly said: One year, though only a brief moment in the long river of history, has so many thrilling deeds worth our eternal remembrance. Over the past year, the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University have carried forward the fearless revolutionary spirit, launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the anti-revisionist counter-revolutionary clique of Lu Ping, and repeatedly struggling against the work teams that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, finally achieving victory. Those seemingly powerful "big shots" have collapsed, and the proletarian "little people" have taken power. A new Peking University has been born. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

In the "three loyalties" activities, revolutionary teachers and students invited old workers, old poor peasants, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army to recall bitterness and sweetness together, thus arousing new hatred and old grudges against the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. At the recall bitterness meeting, revolutionary teachers and students gave a vivid political lesson: Preyan Zhongkun, a student from a poor peasant family, had his sister sent away as soon as she was born in the old society. The elder brother of Sergeant Ci Jinyuan of the People's Liberation Army starved to death. Chen Qinghe, an 85-year-old poor peasant from the Hai Dian People's Commune Nursing Home, had never had a full meal in the old society. He was beaten by the Japanese devils, and during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, he begged for a living. They angrily denounced: The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road said that "exploitation is reasonable," "exploitation is meritorious," and "the more exploitation, the better." This is sheer nonsense. The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road wants to push the workers and peasants back into the abyss of the old society. We will never agree to this! We will never agree to this!

Revolutionary teachers and students raised a series of questions: Why was Preyan Zhongkun's sister sent away as soon as she was born before liberation? Why couldn't Sergeant Ci Jinyuan's elder brother even eat a steamed bun when he was dying? Why did Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and other bad guys still persecute worker and peasant students and squeeze out worker and peasant cadres after liberation? Why couldn't Chairman Mao's educational policy be implemented in Peking University for a long time? The company commander who participated in the recall bitterness correctly answered this question: It was because the power was in the hands of the class enemies before liberation, and the proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University did not truly take power after liberation. The revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University said: Chairman Mao teaches us that all class struggles are for power, revolutionary classes are like this, and counter-revolutionary classes are also like this. With power, you have everything; without power, you have nothing. The revolutionary faction of Peking University is now in power, and we must defend the fruits of the revolution, hold power well, and use power well. We will never give up the proletarian dictatorship, even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows!

The revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University firmly declared that they will, through carrying out the "three loyalties" activities, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, raise higher the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line, and forever establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in Peking University, making Peking University a thoroughly red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

In the eve of the first anniversary of the nationwide first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster approved by Chairman Mao, the soldiers of the New Peking University Commune's Seventh Platoon, in conjunction with the practical struggle of the past year between the two lines, seriously studied the Notification and vowed to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    纪念毛主席亲自批准播发全国第一张马列主义大字报一周年
    北京大学热烈开展“三忠于”活动
    永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    新华社三十一日讯　在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自批准播发全国第一张马列主义的大字报一周年前夕，北京大学广大革命师生员工广泛开展永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的活动。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，牢牢地掌握斗争大方向，把这场大批判、大斗争同本单位斗批改紧紧结合起来，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    一年以前，毛主席亲自主持制定了伟大的历史文件中共中央五月十六日《通知》，紧接着又决定六月一日在广播电台和报纸上发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义大字报，点燃起无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。最近，北京大学的革命师生员工认真学习了《通知》和第一次公开发表的毛主席关于文艺问题的五个文件，人人斗志昂扬，干劲倍增，浓浓的政治空气和节日的气氛充满了北京大学校园。重新复制的鲜红的中共中央五月十六日《通知》和北京大学全国第一张马列主义大字报张贴在大饭厅。到处贴满了庆祝、纪念“六·一”的大字报。聂元梓等同志无限激动地说：我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自制定的中共中央五月十六日《通知》，是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的历史文件。我们的大字报就是在《通知》的鼓舞下诞生的。没有《通知》，就没有我们的大字报。他们号召北大革命师生学好、用好、宣传好五·一六《通知》，倡议全校开展“三忠于”活动。希望大家以活学活用毛主席著作为纲，忆苦思甜，进一步提高阶级觉悟，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，永远紧跟毛主席干革命，永远紧跟中央文革小组的正确领导。聂元梓等同志的倡议说出了广大革命师生员工的心里话，在全校引起了热烈的响应。
    一个以“三忠于”活动为中心的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮在北京大学开展起来了。革命师生员工大讲大用，大忆大比，大学毛主席语录，大唱毛主席语录歌，热情宣传毛泽东思想，大力宣传中共中央五月十六日《通知》的伟大现实意义和历史意义。革命师生们还深入工厂农村，同革命职工、贫下中农一起万炮猛轰中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    北京大学革命师生员工回顾一年来的光辉斗争历程时，激动地说：一年，虽然只是历史长河中短暂的一瞬，但是有多少惊心动魄的事迹值得我们永远牢记。一年来，北大的革命师生发扬大无畏的革命精神，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和陆平反革命修正主义集团猛烈开火，同执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组进行了反复斗争，终于取得了胜利。那些貌似强大的“大人物”垮台了，无产阶级的“小人物”掌权了，新北大诞生了。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    在“三忠于”活动中，革命师生邀请老工人、老贫农和解放军指战员一起忆苦思甜，从而激起了对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的新仇旧恨。在忆苦思甜会上，革命师生上了一堂生动的政治课：贫农家庭出身的颜忠坤同学，在旧社会他的妹妹刚出生就被送给人家。解放军排长慈金元的哥哥在旧社会活活地饿死了。海淀人民公社敬老院八十五岁老贫农陈清河在旧社会没吃过一顿饱饭。他挨过日本鬼子的皮鞭，在蒋介石统治时期，他讨饭度日。他们愤怒声讨：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，胡说什么“剥削有理”、“剥削有功”、“剥削越多越好”，这纯粹是胡说八道。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，妄想把工农群众重新推进旧社会的万丈深渊，我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！
    革命师生提出一系列问题：解放前为什么颜忠坤同学的妹妹生下来就送给别人？为什么慈金元排长的哥哥临死时连一口窝窝头也吃不上？解放后为什么陆平、彭珮云这些坏家伙仍然在迫害工农同学，排挤工农干部？为什么毛主席的教育方针在北大长期不能贯彻？参加忆苦的解放军连长正确地回答了这个问题，就是因为解放前政权在阶级敌人手里，解放后北京大学的无产阶级革命派没有真正掌权。北大革命师生说：毛主席教导我们，一切阶级斗争都是为了政权，革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。有了权就有了一切，没有权就没有一切。北大的革命派现在掌权了，我们一定要保卫革命的果实，掌好权，用好权，头可断，血可流，无产阶级政权永远不能丢！
    北京大学革命师生们坚定地表示，一定要通过开展“三忠于”活动把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，彻底批倒斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底砸烂修正主义教育路线，在北京大学永远永远树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把北京大学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
