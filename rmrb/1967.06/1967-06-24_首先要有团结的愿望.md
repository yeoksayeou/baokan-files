	First, One Must Have the Desire for Unity
		Class Leader Jin Zhongxi

	To correctly handle contradictions among the people, one must first have the desire to resolve issues. This desire is the desire for unity. Our great leader Chairman Mao, when summarizing the methods for resolving contradictions among the people as the formula "unity-criticism-unity," especially emphasized: "First, one must start from the desire for unity."

	The desire for unity is a prerequisite for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Only by starting from the desire for unity can one, when resolving issues, openly and sincerely engage in criticism and self-criticism in a realistic manner; only then can one achieve the goal of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to chaos and make the situation unmanageable.

	Recently, we went to a production brigade to support spring farming. There was a revolutionary mass organization that, because it had made mistakes in the struggle, thought we would not go to help them. We visited them several times, but their leaders always found excuses to avoid us. However, we were determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions to unite with the broad masses of the people, the more the better, and steadfastly unite with them to carry out the revolution and promote production. Through patient and meticulous ideological work, we finally resolved this issue. At this point, we studied with them Chairman Mao's teachings on "putting down the burden and starting the machine," helping them recognize and correct their mistakes, and move forward lightly. As a result, they were able to wholeheartedly engage in the spring farming battle.

	From this incident, I realized: to resolve issues of right and wrong among the people, one must start from the desire for unity. No matter what differences there are, no matter how many obstacles there are, one must not waver in the desire for unity. Contradictions among the people, among comrades, absolutely cannot be resolved by trying to suppress or destroy the other side. Otherwise, there is the danger of turning non-antagonistic contradictions into antagonistic ones.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Contradictions among the people are contradictions on the basis of fundamental unity of the people's interests." Contradictions among the people are not fundamental conflicts of interest. Therefore, among the people, there are a thousand, ten thousand reasons to strengthen unity, but not a single reason to attack or overthrow each other.

	Uniting with comrades is a necessity for the revolution and is in the fundamental interests of the people. Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the fundamental guarantees for the victory of our cause." The dual burdens of revolution and production must be shouldered by the masses. Uniting with one more comrade means adding one more force to fight against the enemy. In our support for agriculture, we worked hard to unite that revolutionary mass organization that had made mistakes, all to mobilize all revolutionary positive factors and win the spring farming battle. If one adopts an attitude of "lone wolf" towards the people and comrades, or even directs the struggle against one's own people, it will bring great harm to the revolutionary cause and objectively help the enemy.

	Whether one loves the people and unites with comrades is a matter of fundamental stance and attitude. Being harsh to the enemy and lenient to oneself is a manifestation of a firm proletarian stance. Chairman Mao said: "The shortcomings of the people need to be criticized, ... but one must truly stand on the side of the people, speaking with the fervor to protect and educate the people. If one treats comrades as enemies, one is standing on the side of the enemy." A person who truly has a firm proletarian stance will inevitably have deep proletarian feelings for their comrades and the masses, seeing them as brothers of the same class, and patiently criticizing and educating them, never treating them with an antagonistic attitude.

	After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, I deeply realized: the proletarian revolutionary faction must have the great ambition to "liberate all mankind," to unite with all those who can be united, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Loving the people and strengthening military-civilian unity is the essence of our people's army. We must forever be heart-to-heart with the masses, forever unite and fight with the broad masses, and advance victoriously along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

    首先要有团结的愿望
        班长　金忠喜
    正确处理人民内部矛盾，首先要有解决问题的愿望。这个愿望，就是团结的愿望。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在把解决人民内部矛盾的方法概括为“团结——批评——团结”这个公式的时候，就特别强调指出：“首先需要从团结的愿望出发。”
    团结的愿望，是正确处理人民内部矛盾的先决条件。从团结的愿望出发，才能在解决问题的时候，开诚相见，实事求是地开展批评和自我批评；才能达到既弄清思想又团结同志的目的。否则，势必乱斗一气，把事情搞得不可收拾。
    前段时间，我们去一个生产大队支援春耕生产。有一个革命群众组织，因为在斗争中曾经犯过错误，就认为我们不会去帮助他们。我们几次找上门，他们的负责人总是借故避开我们。但是，我们决心遵照毛主席关于团结广大人民，团结得越多越好的指示，坚定不移地团结他们，一起抓革命，促生产。经过耐心细致的思想工作，终于解开了这个疙瘩。这时，我们又和他们一起学习了毛主席关于“放下包袱，开动机器”的教导，帮助他们认识错误，改正错误，轻装前进。结果，他们心情舒畅地全力投入春耕战斗。
    从这件事上，我体会到：解决人民内部的是非问题，一定要从团结的愿望出发。不管有什么样的分歧，碰到多大的钉子，决不能动摇团结的愿望。人民内部、同志之间的矛盾，绝对不可以用压倒对方、搞垮对方的办法去解决。否则，就有把非对抗性的矛盾变成对抗性矛盾的危险。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民内部的矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾。”人民内部矛盾不是根本利益的冲突。因此，人民内部只有一千条、一万条加强团结的道理，而没有半条互相攻击、互相打倒的理由。
    团结同志是革命的需要，是人民根本利益所在。毛主席说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”革命、生产两副重担要靠众人挑，多团结一个同志，就多一分打击敌人的力量。我们在支农工作中努力团结那个犯过错误的革命群众组织，就是从调动一切革命的积极因素，打好春耕生产这一仗出发的。如果对人民对同志采取“孤家寡人”的态度，甚至把斗争矛头指向自己人，就会给革命事业带来极大的危害，就在客观上帮了敌人的忙。
    是不是热爱人民，团结同志，这是个根本立场、根本态度问题。对敌狠，对己和，是无产阶级立场坚定的表现。毛主席说：“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的，……但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话。如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”一个真正具有坚定无产阶级立场的人，对自己的同志，对人民群众，必然怀有深厚的无产阶级感情，把他们看作是自己的阶级兄弟，去耐心地批评教育他们，绝不会用敌对的态度去对待他们。
    学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，我深深体会到：无产阶级革命派要有“解放全人类”的伟大胸怀，要团结一切可以团结的人们，把文化大革命进行到底。爱护人民，加强军民团结，是我们人民军队本质的体现。我们要永远和人民群众心连心，永远和广大人民团结、战斗在一起，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进！
