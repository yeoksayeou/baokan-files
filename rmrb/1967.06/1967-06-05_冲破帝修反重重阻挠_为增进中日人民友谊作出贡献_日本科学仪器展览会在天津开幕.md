Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition Opens in Tianjin

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 4th: The Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition opened this morning in Tianjin.

This exhibition is the first professional exhibition organized by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association in China. The exhibition area covers 3,200 square meters, featuring scientific instruments mainly in electronics, analysis, measurement, metrology, and computation, as well as related components. The exhibition was originally scheduled to open on June 1st, but due to the unreasonable obstruction and sabotage by the Japanese reactionary government of Sato, it had to be postponed until today to open.

The opening ceremony was held at the Tianjin Workers' Cultural Palace. A large portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world's people, was hung on the stage. At the beginning of the ceremony, Japanese friends first paid tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world's people, wishing him eternal life, and to Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, wishing him good health forever. They then read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations together with the invited Chinese guests: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true strength does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." "Be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They also sang "The East Is Red" in unison.

Representatives from Tianjin and the Tianjin branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, among other relevant parties, were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The director of the exhibition team's office, Morita Takamaru, said at the meeting that the exhibition is opening in a triumphant struggle, further enhancing the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China. In the struggle against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party, and in promoting Sino-Japanese friendly trade, we deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all the people of the world.

The deputy director of the Japanese Scientific Instruments Exhibition Team, Kobayashi Ryoji, strongly condemned the Japanese reactionary government of Sato, which follows American imperialism, colludes with Soviet modern revisionism and the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party, and intensifies its policy of hostility towards China, attempting to sabotage the exhibition.

The representative from the Tianjin branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Li Zhouxing, warmly congratulated the successful opening of the exhibition and strongly condemned the Japanese reactionary government of Sato for following the bankrupt embargo policy of American imperialism, being hostile to China, and sabotaging the friendly trade and friendship between the two peoples.

At the opening ceremony, congratulatory telegrams from the China-Japan Friendship Association, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and other units, as well as a joint congratulatory telegram from Ishibashi Taneomi, the president of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Utsunomiya Tokuma, the vice president, were read. The telegram from Ishibashi Taneomi and Utsunomiya Tokuma stated that the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, forged in their common struggle, cannot be destroyed by any force, be it American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, Japanese reactionaries, or Japanese revisionists. In his congratulatory telegram, Nakajima Takeshiro, the president of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, expressed that this exhibition, held during the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, will make a great contribution to the development of Sino-Japanese friendly trade and the enhancement of the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

At the end of the opening ceremony, friends from both China and Japan sang "The East Is Red" together.

    冲破帝修反重重阻挠  为增进中日人民友谊作出贡献
    日本科学仪器展览会在天津开幕
    据新华社天津四日电　日本科学仪器展览会今天上午在天津开幕。
    这次展览会是日本国际贸易促进协会在中国举行的第一次专业性展览会。展览面积共三千二百平方米，展品有以电子仪器为主的分析、计测、计量、计算等方面的科学仪器以及有关元件。展览会原定在六月一日开幕，由于日本佐藤反动政府的无理阻挠和破坏，不得不延期到今天才开幕。
    开幕式在天津市第二工人文化宫举行。主席台上悬挂着世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。开幕式开始时，日本朋友首先敬祝全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，敬祝毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席身体永远健康。接着，他们同应邀出席开幕式的中国客人一起朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们还同声高唱《东方红》。
    天津市以及中国国际贸易促进委员会天津分会等有关方面的负责人，应邀出席了开幕式。
    日本科学仪器展览团事务局局长森田尧丸在会上说，展览会是在我们斗争胜利的情况下，在日中两国人民战斗友谊进一步高涨中，隆重开幕的。在同美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义和日共修正主义分子四个敌人的斗争中，在推进日中友好贸易的运动中，使我们深深地体会到，毛泽东思想是全世界人民的指路明灯。
    日本科学仪器展览团副团长小林隆治在讲话中强烈谴责追随美帝国主义的日本佐藤反动政府，同苏联现代修正主义和日共修正主义分子相勾结，加紧推行敌视中国的政策，妄图破坏展览会的举行。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会天津分会负责人李周行在会上热烈祝贺展览会的胜利开幕，强烈谴责日本佐藤反动政府追随美帝国主义早已破产的禁运政策，敌视中国，破坏两国民间贸易和两国人民友好事业的丑恶嘴脸。
    在开幕式上，宣读了中日友好协会、中国国际贸易促进委员会等单位联名发来的贺电，以及日本国际贸易促进协会总裁石桥湛三和副总裁宇都宫德马联名发来的贺电。石桥湛三和宇都宫德马的贺电说，日中两国人民在共同斗争中结成的牢不可破的友谊，是美帝、苏修、日本反动派、日修等任何势力也破坏不了的。日本中国文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏在贺电中表示：在中国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利中举办的这次展览会，将为发展日中友好贸易、增进日中两国人民的战斗友谊作出巨大贡献。
    开幕式结束时，中日两国朋友齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
