The Queen of Zhao had just taken power. Qin intensified its attacks on Zhao. Zhao sought aid from Qi. Qi said: "We will only send troops if Prince Chang'an is sent as a hostage." The Queen refused, and her ministers strongly advised her. The Queen clearly told her attendants, "If anyone mentions sending Prince Chang'an as a hostage again, I will spit in their face."

The Left Minister, Tou Qiu, requested an audience with the Queen. The Queen waited for him, fuming with anger. He entered calmly and bowed to the Queen, saying, "Your servant has a foot ailment and cannot walk quickly. It has been a long time since I last saw you. Please forgive me. I was worried about your health, so I hoped to see you."

The Queen said, "I get around by carriage."

Tou Qiu asked, "Does your appetite decrease each day?"

The Queen said, "I just eat porridge."

Tou Qiu said, "Your servant can no longer eat much, but I force myself to take a walk every day, covering three or four miles. This way, my appetite improves, and my health gets better."

The Queen said, "I can't do that."

At this point, the Queen's anger had subsided somewhat.

The Left Minister then said, "Your servant's youngest son, Shuqi, is not very capable. I am old, and I cherish him deeply. I hope you will allow him to be a palace guard. I dare to make this request."

The Queen said, "Very well. How old is he?"

Tou Qiu replied, "He is fifteen. Though young, I hope you will take care of him after I am gone."

The Queen said, "Do men also love their youngest sons?"

Tou Qiu answered, "Even more than women do!"

The Queen smiled and said, "Women love their sons even more than men do!"

Tou Qiu replied, "I see that you love Princess Yan more than you love Prince Chang'an."

The Queen said, "You are wrong. I love Prince Chang'an more deeply."

The Left Minister said, "Parents love their children and should plan for their future. When you married off Princess Yan, you held her and wept, thinking of her going far away, and your heart ached. After she left, you did not think of her anymore, but during sacrifices, you prayed, 'May she never return!' This is not planning for the future, but hoping she will have sons and grandsons to rule Yan forever?"

The Queen said, "Yes."

The Left Minister said, "Three generations ago, when the state of Zhao was established, how many of the princes and nobles' descendants still exist?"

The Queen answered, "None."

The Left Minister said, "Not only Zhao, but in other states, are there any descendants of the nobles who still exist?"

The Queen answered, "I have not heard of any."

The Left Minister sighed, "These people either died out themselves, or their descendants died out. Is it because these princes and nobles' descendants were all bad? It is because their positions were high but they had no merit, their salaries were high but they had no achievements, and their power was too great. Now, if you elevate Prince Chang'an's status, give him fertile lands, and grant him too much power without making him earn merit for the state, one day when you are gone, how will Prince Chang'an stand firm in Zhao? I think you are planning too short-sightedly for Prince Chang'an, so I say you love him less than you love Princess Yan."

The Queen said, "Alright, let him go wherever you send him!"

Thus, a hundred carriages were prepared for Prince Chang'an, and he was sent to Qi as a hostage. Qi then sent troops.

Zi Yi said, "The king's sons, being close kin, cannot rely on high positions without merit and salaries without achievements to guard large amounts of gold and jade, let alone the sons of ministers!"

    触詟说赵太后（译文）
    （《战国策》，《赵策》四）
    赵太后刚刚掌权。秦加紧攻赵。赵向齐国求援。齐国说：“一定要长安君作人质，才肯出兵。”太后不答应，大臣们极力建议。太后对左右的人明确说：“谁再说要长安君作人质，我就吐他一脸唾沫。”
    左师（官名）触詟（zhé哲）请求见太后。太后怒气冲冲地等他。他不慌不忙进去，到太后面前谢罪说：“老臣脚有毛病，走快了不行，很久见不到你了，请宽恕我。我怕太后身体不好，所以希望见到太后。”太后说：“我靠坐车行动。”触詟问：“每天饮食不会减少吗？”太后说：“靠吃粥罢了。”触詟说：“老臣现在吃不下饭去，每天勉强散步，走三四里，吃得多一点，身体就好一些。”太后说：“我不行。”这时太后的怒气消了些。
    左师接着又说：“我的孩子舒祺最小，不成器，我又老了，很爱怜他。希望你让他做一个黑衣卫士，保卫王宫。冒死请求。”太后说：“行，年纪多大了？”触詟回答：“十五岁了，年龄虽小，愿在我入土前托给太后。”太后说：“男人也爱少子吗？”触詟答：“要超过女的呢！”太后笑道：“妇女更是超过男的吧！”触詟答道：“我看你爱燕后就超过爱长安君。”太后说：“你错了，不如爱长安君爱的深。”左师说：“父母爱子女，就要替他们作长远打算，你嫁送燕后时，抱着她哭，想到她嫁到远方去，心中难过。嫁走了，也不是不想了，但祭祀时必祷祈：‘千万不要使她回来啊！’这还不是作长远打算，要她生子育孙，世代在燕国为王吗？”太后说：“是的。”左师又说：“三辈以前，赵国刚建立的时候，赵王的子孙封侯的，现在还有继续存在的吗？”太后答说：“没有。”左师又说：“不单是赵国，其它各国诸侯有存在的吗？”太后答：“我不曾听说过。”左师感慨地说：“这些人有的本身就灭绝了，时间长的，到子孙也灭绝了，难道是这些王侯的子孙都一定不好吗？因为他们的地位高而没有功勋，俸禄厚而没有劳绩，拥有的权力却太大了，太多了。现在你提高长安君的地位，封赐给他肥沃的地方，多给他权力，而不及时叫他为国立功，有朝一日你死了，长安君靠什么在赵国立足呢？我认为你替长安君打算得太短了，所以说，你爱他不如爱燕后。”太后说：“好，任凭你把他派到什么地方去！”于是，为长安君备车百辆，送他到齐国去作人质，齐国随即出兵。
    子义说：“国王的子孙，是亲骨肉的关系，尚不能仗恃没有功勋的高位，没有劳绩的俸禄，来守大量的金玉财宝，何况下边的臣子的子孙呢！”
