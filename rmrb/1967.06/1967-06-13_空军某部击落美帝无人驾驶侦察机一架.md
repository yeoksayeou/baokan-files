Another New Victory in Defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Air Force Unit Shoots Down U.S. Imperialist Unmanned Reconnaissance Aircraft

The Central Military Commission issued an order of commendation, encouraging them to firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote preparedness for war. They must not relax their vigilance and make new contributions to defending the country's airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: Today in the afternoon, the People's Liberation Army Air Force unit in a certain location in Guangxi shot down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned reconnaissance aircraft that had intruded into our airspace for reconnaissance and provocation. This is another new victory achieved by our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force in the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hoisting high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, in defending the country's airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The Central Military Commission today issued an order of commendation, praising the People's Liberation Army Air Force unit in a certain location in Guangxi for shooting down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned reconnaissance aircraft.

The order of commendation states: Your victory is the result of hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and promoting ideological revolutionization. It is the result of your faithful revolutionary actions in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This victory greatly encourages our people and the people of Vietnam and is a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialists' plot to expand the war in Vietnam.

The order of commendation points out: Recently, while the U.S. imperialists have been intensifying their expansion of the war in Vietnam, on one hand, they support the British imperialists in suppressing our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, attempting to turn Hong Kong into a base for their war in Vietnam and anti-China activities; on the other hand, they instigate Israel to launch an aggressive war against the Arab people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Create disturbances, fail, create more disturbances, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." You must firmly respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to seize the revolution and promote preparedness for war. Do not relax your vigilance and make new contributions to defending the country's airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    保卫无产阶级文化大革命的又一新胜利
    空军某部击落美帝无人驾驶侦察机一架
    中央军委颁发嘉奖令，勉励他们坚决响应毛主席关于抓革命，促战备的伟大号召，务必不要松懈自己的警惕性，为保卫祖国领空和保卫无产阶级文化大革命作出新贡献
    新华社十二日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部，今天下午在广西某地上空，击落了侵入我国领空进行侦察挑衅的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机一架。这是在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在保卫祖国领空和保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，所取得的又一新的胜利。
    新华社十二日讯　中共中央军委今天颁发嘉奖令，表扬在广西某地上空击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机一架的中国人民解放军空军某部。
    嘉奖令说，你们所取得的胜利，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化的结果，是你们忠实地以革命的实际行动保卫无产阶级文化大革命的结果。这一胜利，是对我国人民和越南人民的很大鼓舞，是对美帝国主义扩大侵越战争阴谋的有力打击。
    嘉奖令指出，最近美帝国主义在加紧扩大侵越战争的同时，一方面支持英帝国主义镇压我港九爱国同胞，力图把香港变成它的侵越战争和反华基地；另一方面指使以色列悍然发动对阿拉伯人民的侵略战争。毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”你们在当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，一定要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于抓革命，促战备的伟大号召，务必不要松懈自己的警惕性，为保卫祖国领空和保卫无产阶级文化大革命作出新的贡献。
