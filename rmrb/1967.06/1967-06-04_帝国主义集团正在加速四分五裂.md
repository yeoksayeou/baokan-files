The imperialist camp, led by the United States, is further heading towards disintegration. Currently, the contradictions among imperialist countries, especially between the United States and France and other Western European countries, are becoming increasingly sharp and apparent.

After World War II, U.S. imperialism took advantage of the weakened positions of Western European countries due to the war, controlling them in various ways and forcing them to submit and pay tribute, thereby intensifying the contradictions with Western European countries. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "U.S. imperialism even implements a 'might makes right' policy towards its allies in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania, attempting to trample them underfoot."

The contradictions between imperialist countries and imperialist monopolies are a fundamental contradiction in the contemporary world. This contradiction is also irreconcilable. In recent years, due to the operation of the law of uneven development of capitalism, the economic strength of Western European countries has relatively increased, and the balance of power among imperialist countries has changed in a way that is unfavorable to the United States. The United States is gradually falling from its position of dominance and can no longer be as arrogant as it was in the early post-war period. As early as more than ten years ago, Stalin had said that Western European countries "will ultimately have to break away from the embrace of the United States, clash with the United States, to ensure their independence, of course, also to ensure their high profits."

For a period of time, the struggle between France and other Western European countries with the United States over markets, their struggle for control and counter-control, and their struggle for hegemony over Western Europe and the capitalist world have gradually intensified. France's expulsion of U.S. troops and the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization indicates that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can no longer maintain even a superficial unity and has fallen into an unprecedented state of disintegration. West Germany has long been the main pillar of U.S. control over Western Europe. However, now, the contradictions between the West German monopoly capital groups and the U.S. monopoly capital groups have also developed. The new West German government is showing a tendency to move closer to France and distance itself from the United States. Britain, with U.S. support, attempted to enter the "Common Market" of the Six Nations but was blocked by France's firm opposition. These situations indicate that the resistance of Western European countries to U.S. control has become an inevitable trend, and countries like Britain, which blindly follow the United States and act as Washington's lackey, will only lead themselves into economic difficulties and political isolation, reducing themselves to second or third-rate roles among the imperialist camp.

It should be pointed out that the decline of U.S. imperialism and the disintegration within the imperialist camp are the result of the development of the international class struggle. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have become unprecedentedly powerful, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has powerfully promoted the world revolution, the great victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and the flourishing revolutionary struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world have greatly weakened the strength of U.S. imperialism and disrupted its global strategic deployment. To save its defeat in Vietnam, to curb the powerful force of the Chinese revolution, and to extinguish the flames of the Asian people's revolution, U.S. imperialism has had to transfer part of its military forces stationed in Western Europe to the East, correspondingly weakening its control over Western Europe. U.S. imperialism is at a loss, and this is favorable for Western European countries to seize the opportunity to strengthen their struggle against U.S. control and challenge the U.S. hegemony.

Although the monopoly groups of various imperialist countries continue to collude with each other to oppose the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, this cannot hide or mitigate their contradictions and struggles for power and profit. The fact is that the more the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries rise, the more the imperialist camp is hit hard, the more their contradictions develop.

At present, when the U.S. imperialist hegemony in Western Europe is wavering and it is surrounded on all sides in the world, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique comes out to "escort" the United States. They collude with U.S. imperialism, promote "détente" in Europe, and make deals on issues such as preventing nuclear proliferation. This is not only to oppose the people of Europe and the world but also to help the United States control Western Europe and implement the policy of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world.

However, whether it is U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, or their collusion, the attempt to dominate Europe and the world is just a futile dream. The fate of the world is decided by the people of the world. The arrogant policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism will inevitably suffer fatal blows from the people of all countries in the world.

Of course, Western Europe is an important stronghold of the entire capitalist rule and the main market for the export of U.S. capital and goods. It is the key to the U.S. imperialist global strategic system. U.S. imperialism will never give up Western Europe. However, the more it tries to tighten control, the more it will intensify the contradictions with Western European countries. The complete disintegration of the imperialist camp led by the United States is inevitable.

    帝国主义集团正在加速四分五裂
    本报评论员
    毛主席早就说过，帝国主义阵营的内部是分裂的。以美国为首的帝国主义集团，正在进一步走向四分五裂。现在，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，特别是美国同法国和其他西欧国家之间的矛盾，正在趋于尖锐化和表面化。
    第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义利用西欧各国在战争中大大削弱了的地位，从各方面把西欧控制起来，迫使西欧各国向它称臣纳贡，加剧了它们同西欧各国的矛盾。正如毛主席所指出：“美帝国主义甚至对它在西欧、北美和大洋洲的盟国，也实行‘弱肉强食’的政策，力图把它们踩在自己的脚下。”
    帝国主义国家和帝国主义国家之间，垄断资本集团之间的矛盾，这是当代世界的一个基本矛盾。这个矛盾也是不可调和的。近年来，由于资本主义发展不平衡规律所起的作用，西欧各国的经济实力有了相对的增长，帝国主义各国之间的力量对比，发生了不利于美国的变化。美国正在从它的霸主的宝座上一步步跌落下来，已经不可能象战后初期那样“神气”了。早在十多年前，斯大林就曾说过，西欧国家“归根到底将不得不从美国的怀抱里挣脱出来，同美国发生冲突，以便保证自己的独立地位，当然也保证自己的高额利润”。
    一个时期以来，法国和其他西欧国家同美国争夺市场的斗争，它们之间控制和反控制的斗争，争夺西欧和资本主义世界霸权的斗争，逐步地激烈起来了。法国驱逐美国驻军和北大西洋集团总部的行动，表明了北大西洋集团现在连表面的团结都已无法维持，陷入了前所未有的分崩离析状态。西德一向是美国控制西欧的主要支柱。但是现在，西德垄断资本集团同美国垄断资本集团之间的矛盾也有所发展了。西德新政府正在表现出进一步靠拢法国而同美国有所疏远的倾向。英国在美国支持下想要打入六国“共同市场”，由于法国的坚决抵制而碰壁。这些情况说明，西欧各国抵抗美国的控制，已经成为一种不可避免的趋势，而象英国那样一味追随美国，充当华盛顿的小伙计，只能使它自己在经济上陷于困境，政治上日趋孤立，在帝国主义一伙中降为二、三流的小角色。
    应当指出，美帝国主义的衰落，帝国主义集团内部的分崩离析，是整个国际阶级斗争发展的结果。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的空前强大，中国无产阶级文化大革命对世界革命的有力推动，越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，亚非拉和全世界人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，大大削弱了美帝国主义的力量，打乱了它的全球战略的部署。为了挽救侵越败局，遏制中国革命的强大威力，扑灭亚洲人民革命的烈火，美帝国主义不得不把它驻在西欧的一部分军事力量转移到东方来，相应地削弱了它对西欧的控制。美帝国主义顾此失彼，捉襟见肘，有利于西欧国家乘机而起，加强了反对美国控制的斗争，向美国的霸权地位提出了挑战。
    尽管帝国主义各国垄断集团不断相互勾结，反对世界各国人民的革命斗争。但是，这并不能掩盖，更不能缓和它们之间争权夺利的矛盾和斗争。事实是，各国人民革命斗争越是高涨，帝国主义集团越是受到沉重打击，他们之间的矛盾就越是发展。
    现在，正当美帝国主义在西欧的霸权发生动摇，在全世界陷入四面楚歌之时，苏联修正主义领导集团却出来为美国“保驾”。他们同美帝国主义互相勾结，在欧洲大搞
  “缓和”，并且在防止核扩散等问题上大做交易，不仅是为了反对欧洲人民和世界人民，也是为了帮助美国控制西欧，推行所谓美苏合作主宰世界的政策。
    但是，无论是美帝也好，苏修也好，或者它们勾结在一起也好，要想称霸欧洲，称霸世界，都不过是痴心妄想。世界的命运，是由世界人民来决定的。美帝苏修这种狂妄的政策，必然会遭到世界各国人民的致命打击。
    当然，西欧是整个资本主义统治的重要阵地，是美国资本输出和商品输出的主要市场，是美帝国主义全球战略体系的重点。美帝国主义绝不会放弃西欧。但是，它越要加紧控制，就越要加剧它同西欧国家之间的矛盾。以美国为首的帝国主义走向彻底的四分五裂，是不可避免的。
