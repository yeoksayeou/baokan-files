The struggle of the Arab people against aggression has entered a more complex and arduous stage.

The U.S. imperialists have instigated Israel to launch a surprise attack on Arab countries, and after achieving military success, they are now trying every means to consolidate their foothold in the Middle East.

The U.S. imperialists have always used the counter-revolutionary strategy of combining war and "peace" to carry out their aggressive policies. This time in the Middle East, they have played these two hands even more deceitfully. The U.S. imperialists hide in the background, letting their lackey Israel carry out the aggressive war, and then appear as a third party, using the United Nations to play the "peace" trick. The two hands support and complement each other to achieve their goal of aggression against Arab countries.

Now it is clear to everyone that from Israel's armed attack to the subsequent United Nations' call for a ceasefire, and to the so-called "political solution" currently being brewed, all are carefully planned steps of aggression by U.S. imperialism. The leaders of U.S. imperialism have already taken on the attitude of "victors," throwing aside the fine words they said not long ago about maintaining the "political independence and territorial integrity of all countries in the Middle East," and openly opposing the withdrawal of Israeli aggressor troops from the areas they have occupied, shouting that "everything cannot be restored to the state before the June 5th battle began." The aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism against Arab countries are now fully exposed.

However, U.S. imperialism still wants to deceive the Arab people. It tries to make the Arab people believe that the United Nations is the "appropriate place to achieve Middle East peace." The Soviet revisionist clique is also strenuously helping it to promote this.

What is the so-called "Middle East peace" of U.S. imperialism?

This time, U.S. imperialism launched an aggression against Arab countries as part of its counter-revolutionary global strategy to establish world hegemony. Supporting the Zionist regime of Israel, threatening and waiting for an opportunity to invade Arab countries, to suppress the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people, and to consolidate and expand its strategic position and colonial interests in the Middle East, this is the established policy of U.S. imperialism. Further promoting neo-colonialism in the Middle East region, plundering and enslaving the people of various Arab countries, while not allowing the Arab people to resist, this is its so-called "Middle East peace." Can the Arab people have any illusions about such a most vicious enemy? No, no, absolutely not.

Is the United Nations the "appropriate place to achieve Middle East peace"?

The disgraceful record of the United Nations has long proven that it is nothing more than a tool of aggression for U.S. imperialism. This time, it has once again played this shameful role. Moreover, U.S. imperialism is now, with the close cooperation of the Soviet revisionist clique, scheming to use the United Nations to impose a bandit plan that harms the interests of the Arab people on Arab countries. Can one imagine that the United Nations, this tool of aggression for U.S. imperialism, under the manipulation of the big powers like the U.S. and the Soviet Union, will do anything unfavorable to the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism? This is absolutely impossible.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "Oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle."

In this anti-aggression struggle, the Arab people have already suffered enough from the aggression of U.S. imperialism, been deceived enough by the Soviet revisionist clique, and lost enough from the "mediation" of the United Nations. The lessons are very painful. Currently, U.S. imperialism and its gang are hastening to plot further aggression against Arab countries. The Arab people must learn from these lessons, distinguish between enemies and friends, heighten vigilance, not believe their "good words," and not be afraid of their threats. Although the struggle is arduous and complex, as long as they are determined and persist in struggle, the Arab people will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.

    提高警惕，坚持斗争
    本报评论员
    阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争进入到更加复杂和艰巨的阶段。
    美帝国主义指使以色列对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击，在军事上得手以后，正在千方百计巩固它在中东的侵略阵地。
    美帝国主义一贯使用战争与“和平”的反革命两手策略，推行它的侵略政策。这一次在中东，它的这两手搞得更加阴险。美帝国主义自己躲在背后，主要让它的走狗以色列进行侵略战争，然后又以第三者的面目出现，利用联合国玩弄“和平”阴谋，两手互相策应配合，以实现它对阿拉伯国家的侵略目的。
    现在人们都看得很清楚，从以色列的武装进攻，到后来的联合国“停火”呼吁，到目前在酝酿中的所谓“政治解决”，都完全是美帝国主义精心策划的侵略步骤。美帝国主义的头目已经摆出了一副“战胜者”的姿态，把他们不久以前亲口说出的所谓维护中东“所有国家的政治独立和领土完整”的漂亮话扔到一边，公然反对让以色列侵略军队撤出它所霸占的地方，叫嚷什么不能“一切都恢复到六月五日战斗开始以前的状态”。美帝国主义的以色列走狗们，则更是露骨地提出了狂妄的扩张要求。美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的侵略野心，昭然若揭了。
    但是，美帝国主义还想愚弄阿拉伯人民。它力图要阿拉伯人民相信，联合国是所谓“实现中东和平的合适场所”。苏修集团也竭力帮它鼓吹。
    美帝国主义的所谓“中东和平”是什么货色呢？
    美帝国主义这一次发起对阿拉伯国家的侵略，是它旨在建立世界霸权的反革命全球战略的一个组成部分。扶植以色列犹太复国主义政权，威胁和伺机侵略阿拉伯国家，以镇压阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争，巩固和扩大它在中东的战略地位和殖民利益，这是美帝国主义的既定政策。在中东地区进一步推行新殖民主义，掠夺和奴役阿拉伯各国人民，而又不允许阿拉伯人民起来反抗，这就是它的所谓“中东和平”。阿拉伯人民能够对这样一个最凶恶的敌人抱有幻想吗？不能，不能，绝对不能。
    联合国是实现中东和平的“合适场所”吗？
    联合国的不光采的纪录，早已证明它不过是美帝国主义的一个侵略工具，这一回它又再一次发挥了这种可耻的作用。而且美帝国主义现在正是在苏修集团的密切配合下，阴谋利用联合国，把一个损害阿拉伯人民利益的强盗方案强加给阿拉伯国家。难道能够设想，联合国这个美帝国主义的侵略工具，在美苏等大国操纵之下，会作出不利于美帝国主义侵略政策的事情来吗？这是根本不可能的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    阿拉伯人民在这一次反侵略斗争中，已经受够了美帝国主义侵略的害，上够了苏修集团出卖的当，吃够了联合国“调停”的亏。教训是十分惨痛的。目前，美帝国主义及其一伙又在加紧策划进一步侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋，阿拉伯人民必须吸取教训，分清敌友，提高警惕，不相信它们的“好话”，不害怕它们的威胁。纵然斗争是艰巨的，复杂的。但是只要下定决心，坚持斗争，阿拉伯人民就一定能够排除万难，取得最后的胜利。
