	Never Forget Class Bitterness, Always Remember Blood Debts
	People's Liberation Army Unit, Li Fengcai

	Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese proletariat suffers from three kinds of oppression (imperialist oppression, bourgeois oppression, and feudal oppression), and the severity and cruelty of these oppressions are rarely seen among the peoples of the world." However, the henchmen of the Chinese Khrushchev, the counter-revolutionary revisionists like Xia Yan, openly defy Chairman Mao's teachings. In the film *Lin's Cloth Shop*, they portray the capitalist who sucks the blood and sweat of workers as a "kind-hearted" good person, a "caring" relative. Look, in *Lin's Cloth Shop*, the shop owner Lin not only does not exploit or oppress the employees but also cares for them deeply. He even betroths his daughter to the employee Shou Sheng.

	Is the relationship between the capitalist and the employees one of relatives? No! Absolutely not! My father's experience is the ironclad evidence. When my father was fifteen, his hometown suffered a flood. For several days, the family couldn't open their mouths to eat, so my father had to go to the county seat to seek help from relatives and friends. One of my father's relatives was the owner of the "Xinglong Restaurant." He showed great "compassion" and kept my father in the shop as an apprentice. He said, "We are relatives, I guarantee I won't treat you badly." But as soon as my father entered the shop, he completely forgot about being relatives. From that day on, my father had to get up early and sleep late, carrying over thirty loads of water a day, and also had to cook, sell goods, and serve the boss. If he was even a little slow, he would either be scolded or beaten, and he would be punished by "saving" a meal. In old society, the boss was so cruel even to his own relatives. How could he be so good to an employee like Shou Sheng? The boss eats well, while the employee "works himself into the coffin." My father worked as an apprentice for over four years. In the end, he fell ill, and this relative boss not only showed no mercy but also withheld all his wages and took the opportunity to fire my father, forcing him to rely on casual labor and flee to escape hardship. What kind of "relative" is this? This is a butcher who kills without shedding blood and eats without spitting bones, an enemy of the working people that we must never forgive.

	We know that in a class society, there is only class struggle, not class harmony. The working class can only seize political power through armed struggle, overthrow the exploiting class, and achieve liberation. We must not place our hopes on the "benevolence" of the bourgeoisie. The film *Lin's Cloth Shop* distorts history and peddles the theory of class harmony. Xia Yan and his gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists are so bold because they have the support of the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev is the darling of the bourgeoisie. He sees the bourgeoisie as his relatives and the working class as his enemies. He vigorously promotes the theory of class harmony, attempting to lull us into complacency, making us relax our struggle against the bourgeoisie, and preparing the conditions for his counter-revolutionary restoration plot. Tell the Chinese Khrushchev, we workers, peasants, and soldiers will not fall for your tricks. The exploiting class must be thoroughly overthrown and eliminated. We will never cooperate with the exploiting class. A tiger is a tiger and will never become a sheep. All exploiting classes are our enemies, and the Chinese Khrushchev is our greatest enemy. We must overthrow them and let the wheel of history pass judgment on them.

    不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇
    解放军某部　李凤彩
    毛主席说：“中国无产阶级身受三种压迫（帝国主义的压迫、资产阶级的压迫、封建势力的压迫），而这些压迫的严重性和残酷性，是世界各民族中少见的”。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫的爪牙、反革命修正主义分子夏衍，公然对抗毛主席的教导，在影片《林家铺子》中，把吮吸工人血汗的资本家描绘成“心地慈善”的“好人”，关心店员的“亲人”。你看，《林家铺子》中的林老板对店员不仅没有剥削，没有压迫，而且十分关怀体贴，甚至把女儿许配给了店员寿生。
    资本家和店员之间的关系是“亲人”的关系吗？不是！绝对不是！我父亲的经历就是铁证。父亲十五岁那年，家乡遭水灾，好几天全家揭不开锅，父亲只好到县城里去找亲友求救。我父亲的一个亲戚是“兴隆集”菜馆的老板，他大发“善心”，把父亲留在店里当伙计。他说：“咱们都是亲戚，保证亏待不了你。”可是父亲一进店门，他就根本不认亲戚了。从那天起，父亲每天早起晚睡，一天要挑三十多担水，还要做饭、卖货、侍候老板，稍一迟缓，轻则一顿大骂，重则挨棍，还要罚你“节省”一顿饭。旧社会的老板对自己亲戚都这样狠，对寿生那样的伙计还能那么好吗？老板和店员之间只能是：老板吃得欢，伙计“累进棺”。我父亲当了四年多伙计，最后生了病，这个亲戚老板不但没有发一点善心，而且扣下所有工钱，乘机把父亲解雇了，逼得父亲靠打长工，外出逃荒过日子。这是什么样的“亲人”，这是杀人不见血，吃人不吐骨头的刽子手，是劳动人民不共戴天的仇人。
    我们知道，在阶级社会中，只有阶级斗争，没有阶级调和。工人阶级只有武装夺取政权，把剥削阶级打倒，才能得到翻身解放，决不能把希望寄托在资产阶级的“恩赐”上面。影片《林家铺子》却歪曲历史，大肆贩卖阶级调和论。夏衍等一伙反革命修正主义分子所以这样胆大包天，就是因为有中国的赫鲁晓夫这个后台老板的支持。中国的赫鲁晓夫是资产阶级的孝子贤孙，他把资产阶级分子看成亲人，把工人阶级看成仇人。他大力宣扬阶级调和论，企图麻痹我们，使我们放松对资产阶级的斗争，为实现他的反革命复辟阴谋准备条件。告诉中国的赫鲁晓夫，我们工农兵决不会上你的当，剥削阶级就该彻底打倒，彻底消灭。我们决不会和剥削阶级搞合作。老虎就是老虎，绝不会变绵羊。一切剥削阶级都是我们的仇人，中国的赫鲁晓夫则是我们最大的仇人。我们一定要把他们打倒，让历史的车轮来判处他们的死刑。
