    Never Forget the Family Treasure

    Chairman Mao teaches us: Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: "Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to put politics in command, never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in his poisonous weed "On Cultivation," does not mention a word about the real class struggle, does not mention a word about the dictatorship of the proletariat. On the contrary, he vigorously advocates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle" and propagates idealist cultivation theory. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he shamelessly calls himself an "old revolutionary." Pfft! What old revolutionary? He is a thorough and through counter-revolutionary! The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have in the past seen through the various counter-revolutionary tricks of the class enemy, and now can see through the wolfish ambitions of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

    We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel from our own experiences: The dictatorship of the proletariat is our lifeline, it is our family treasure. In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the landlord class; when we rose up to resist, the landlord class would suppress us with arms. The fundamental reason was that the power was in the hands of the enemy. Great Leader Chairman Mao led us in revolution. After a long and arduous armed struggle, we seized power. With power in our hands, we can defeat the aggression of imperialism from outside and suppress the counter-revolutionary activities of the class enemy from inside. Like the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in our country, it would be impossible to carry out without the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in his "On Cultivation," does not mention a word about the fundamental issue of revolution, which is the issue of power. Is it that he has not thought about power? No! Not at all! He thinks about power every moment, only he does not think about the proletariat dictating, but about the bourgeoisie dictating. His "On Cultivation," revised and republished in 1962, is precisely to seize power from the proletariat and restore capitalism.

    The bigger the capitalist-roader in power within the Party opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, the more we must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution precisely to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is trying every means to overthrow our dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. In our commune and brigade, when a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party were in charge, they promoted individual farming and contracting production to households, dismantling the socialist stage, attempting to drag us poor and lower-middle peasants back to the old road, making us suffer exploitation and oppression again. If we do not overthrow them and let them continue to be in power, seizing our power, our country will change color.

    We seized power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and we hold power relying on Mao Zedong Thought. The reactionary classes will never be content with their failure. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame by learning from King Xiang." We must carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground, and thoroughly fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to disgrace the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the sky over the whole of China and the whole world!

    念念不忘传家宝
    北京市昌平县太陵园
    大队民兵副指导员  张桂福
    毛主席教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记无产阶级专政。林副主席教导我们：“念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在他的《修养》这株大毒草中，闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题。相反的，他极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，宣扬唯心主义的修养论。在无产阶级文化大革命运动开始后，他还恬不知耻地自称是“老革命”。呸！什么老革命？他是地地道道的老反革命！用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，过去识破了阶级敌人的种种反革命伎俩，现在也能够看穿党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的狼子野心。
    我们贫下中农从自己的亲身经历中深深地体会到：无产阶级专政是我们的命根子，是我们传家的法宝。在旧社会，我们贫下中农受尽了地主阶级的剥削和压迫，有理没处说；当我们起来反抗时，地主阶级就武装镇压我们。根本原因就是政权在敌人手中。伟大领袖毛主席领导我们闹革命。经过了长期的艰苦的武装斗争，我们夺取了政权。我们有了政权，对外能够打败帝国主义的侵略，对内能够镇压阶级敌人的复辟活动。象我国当前正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，要不是在无产阶级专政的条件下，是根本不可能进行的。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》中，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，这难道是他没想到政权吗？不是！完全不是！他每时每刻想的都是政权，只不过想的不是要无产阶级专政，而是要资产阶级专政。他的《修养》在一九六二年重新修改出版，就是为了要向无产阶级夺取政权，复辟资本主义。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派越是反对无产阶级专政，我们就越是要加强无产阶级专政。我们搞无产阶级文化大革命，为的就是巩固无产阶级专政。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，极力妄图推翻我们的无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。我们公社、大队在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掌权时，他们搞单干，搞包产到户，拆社会主义的台，妄想拉我们贫下中农走回头路，叫我们再受剥削，受压迫。如果我们不把他们打倒，让他们继续掌权，专我们的政，我们的国家就要改变颜色。
    我们夺权靠的是毛泽东思想，掌权靠的也是毛泽东思想。反动阶级是决不会甘心于他们的失败的。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们要发扬痛打落水狗的精神，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在全中国和全世界的上空永远飘扬！
