	Malaysian Crowds Protest Against Persecution of Political Prisoners
	On June 2 and 3, crowds in five cities in Malaysia, despite police suppression, held demonstrations and marches, strongly protesting against the Rahman puppet regime's maltreatment of political prisoners and suppression of demonstrations supporting political prisoners. In the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, hundreds of young people chanted slogans and marched in the streets. The police tried to disperse them with tear gas, but the demonstrators retaliated with stones, sticks, and tin cans. In the northwest coastal cities of Penang, Malacca, and in the southern city of Johor Bahru, large-scale marches were held. It is reported that 50 political prisoners in the Taiping concentration camp went on a hunger strike on May 27, protesting against the fascist atrocities of the Rahman puppet regime against political prisoners. After this news spread, the next day, various parts of Malaysia launched a struggle to support political prisoners.

	CIA Intensifies Infiltration into India
	A former CIA official recently revealed in an article in the U.S. "Saturday Evening Post" that U.S. imperialism, in order to intensify its infiltration and control of India, has not only established various spy organizations in India but also set up various "unions." The so-called "Indian Port Workers' Union" is organized by the CIA.
