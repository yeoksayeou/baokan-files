The so-called "Kennedy Round" tariff negotiations, involving the United States, Western European countries, Japan, and Canada, concluded on May 15 after more than four years of intense haggling. The United States' initial plan to benefit at the expense of others was largely thwarted due to strong resistance from Western European nations.

These negotiations among imperialist and capitalist countries were initiated by former U.S. President Kennedy, hence the name "Kennedy Round." The primary goal of the U.S. in proposing these talks was to use the pretext of "mutual tariff reduction" to break down the tariff barriers of the Western European "Common Market," paving the way for a massive influx of American goods, particularly "surplus" agricultural products, into the European market.

From the outset, the U.S.'s obvious attempt to benefit at the expense of others faced staunch resistance from the six countries of the "Common Market." These nations firmly rejected the U.S. proposal to uniformly reduce industrial tariff rates by 50%.

As a result, from the first day of negotiations, both sides engaged in fierce bargaining, neither side willing to yield, leading to a prolonged stalemate that lasted over four years. The talks nearly collapsed several times during this period.

In mid-March of this year, the negotiations entered their final stage. After intense arguments, the participating countries set May 14 as the final deadline for the talks.

Finally, on May 15, a comprehensive, principled agreement was barely reached.

Post-negotiation statements and reports from Western news agencies revealed that the agreement's main points were far from the U.S.'s original intentions.

Firstly, regarding the reduction of industrial tariffs, the relevant countries agreed to gradually reduce tariffs by approximately one-third over the next five years, rather than adhering to the U.S.'s original insistence on a uniform 50% reduction.

Secondly, on the issue of agricultural trade, the six nations firmly rejected the U.S. demand that the "Common Market" guarantee quantities of American agricultural products, thereby thwarting one of the U.S.'s main objectives in initiating these negotiations.

### 西方关税谈判吵得不可开交  美国损人利己遭到西欧抵制

    西方关税谈判吵得不可开交 
    美国损人利己遭到西欧抵制
    据新华社讯　日内瓦消息：经过持续四年多的激烈讨价还价之后，有美国、西欧各国、日本和加拿大等参加的所谓“肯尼迪回合”关税谈判在五月十五日收场，美国原先的一套损人利己的如意算盘，由于遭到西欧国家的强烈抵制，基本上落了空。
    这些帝国主义和资本主义国家的关税谈判是根据美国前总统肯尼迪的倡议举行的，所以称为“肯尼迪回合”谈判。美国倡议举行这次谈判的主要目的，就是要在“互减关税”的幌子下，打破西欧“共同市场”的关税壁垒，为美国货，特别是为美国的“剩余”农产品大举涌入西欧市场扫清道路。
    美国这种明显的损人利己的企图从一开始就遇到了西欧“共同市场”六国的顽强抵制。六国坚决不同意按美国的主张，把各国现行的工业品关税率“一律削减百分之五十”。
    因此，从谈判的第一天起，双方就唇枪舌剑，各不相让，进行了激烈的讨价还价，以致谈判拖了四年多，久久达不成协议，中途还曾几次濒于破裂。
    今年三月中旬，谈判进入了最后阶段。经过激烈争吵后，参加谈判的各国确定五月十四日为谈判的最后期限。
    最后，总算在十五日勉强达成了一个“一揽子”的原则性协议。
    谈判结束后发表的公报以及西方通讯社在报道中透露的情况表明，协议的主要内容同美国原来的打算相去很远。
    首先，在削减工业品关税方面，有关各国表示同意在今后五年内，分阶段地逐步做到平均削减关税三分之一左右，而不是象美国原先所坚持的那样，“一律削减百分之五十”。
    其次，在农产品贸易问题上，六国坚决拒绝了美国要“共同市场”保证美国农产品数量的要求，使美国当初倡议举行这次谈判的一个主要打算落了空。
