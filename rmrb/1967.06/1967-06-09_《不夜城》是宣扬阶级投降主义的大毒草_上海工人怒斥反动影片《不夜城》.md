The reactionary film "The Nightless City" was produced under the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party in 1958. This reactionary film shamelessly glorifies the bourgeoisie, viciously slanders the proletariat, and advocates the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism.

Recently, Shanghai workers held a symposium to denounce the reactionary film "The Nightless City." Below is a partial summary of the symposium's speeches.

Glorifying the bourgeoisie and creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism

Yang Fuzhen (National Labor Model Worker, Worker of No. 1 Cotton Mill), Cheng Dewang (Five-Good Worker, Trishaw Worker): After watching "The Nightless City," we workers were all furious. The directors of this reactionary film stubbornly stand on the side of the bourgeoisie, singing praises for the capitalists, and portraying those bloodsuckers and parasites as "heroes." This is a complete reversal of right and wrong, extremely reactionary. The film portrays Zhang Boke, a reactionary capitalist who relied on imperialism to get rich, as a "thrifty" and "patriotic" "red capitalist," depicting him as daring to confess his five poisons, willingly requesting public-private cooperation, and even joyfully entering socialism. How can there be such a thing in the world?

Capitalists are the ones who oppress and exploit us workers. The reactionary film "The Nightless City" glorifies the bourgeoisie, conceals its class nature, and advocates the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. They want Zhang Boke and his ilk to oppress us again and ride on our heads. We workers will never allow it, not in a thousand or ten thousand ways!

Zhao Zhendie (Five-Good Worker, Worker of No. 22 Cotton Mill): The reactionary film "The Nightless City" advocates the reactionary theory of "exploitation is meritorious" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. The author portrays the capitalists as so "progressive," contributing so much to society, being so "thrifty and hardworking," and so "caring" for the workers... This is sheer nonsense.

All crows are black. The bourgeoisie exploits the workers the most ruthlessly. Before liberation, our factory had a capitalist who, like Zhang Yaotang, dressed in plain clothes and shoes, chanting "Amitabha." But he did all kinds of exploitative things. Capitalists never sympathize with us workers. At that time, my mother was pregnant and still had to work hard. After giving birth, she couldn't come to work for three days and was immediately fired by the capitalist. I started working in a cotton mill at the age of eleven and suffered endless torment. I worked for twenty-two months and didn't earn a single cent. Before the age of sixteen, I never wore a cotton-padded jacket. After I grew up, I worked more than ten hours a day and only earned one or two jiao. Capitalists beating workers was an everyday occurrence. Many of my sisters still have scars on their bodies. How many of our class brothers and sisters were driven to ruin, separated from their families. Where is there such a "good" capitalist as in "The Nightless City"? "The Nightless City" portraying capitalists as good is completely a lie.

Ni Haibao (National Labor Model Worker, Worker of No. 9 Cotton Mill): This film sings praises for the capitalists to the point of being nauseating. In the film, when the worker Yin Di is injured by a shuttle, the capitalist suddenly has a "change of heart," personally visits the hospital, and even sheds tears of remorse. How can capitalists care for workers like this? This is sheer nonsense!

In the past, our factory had an old weaving worker who was hit in the eye by a shuttle, bleeding profusely, with the eyeball falling out, and the injury was very severe. The class sisters in the factory were all very anxious and went to visit him one after another. But the capitalist didn't care at all. Capitalists treat workers like cattle and horses, where is there so much "humanity"?

The reactionary film "The Nightless City" portrays ruthless capitalists as "great benevolent people," and wants us to dig out the "treasures" of the bourgeoisie, and wants us to bring the capitalists into socialism. The film conceals the nature of the exploiting class, advocates "unity of two into one," opposes the socialist revolution, opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Distorting the great image of the working class and advocating class capitulationism

Tang Yingbin (National Labor Model Worker, Engineer of Jiangnan Shipyard): "The Nightless City" is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary film. It distorts the image of the working class and advocates class capitulationism. The film portrays us workers as cowardly and unworthy of struggle. The old Qu in the film is in cahoots with the capitalist Zhang Boke and has none of the spirit of our working class. He flatters and fawns, acting like a slave. His son, Qu Haisheng, was nominally a leader of the workers' movement before liberation, but in reality, he was a thorough right-opportunist. He was fired and didn't dare to struggle against the capitalist. After liberation, he hung the sign of the district committee's industrial department head, advocating the theory of class reconciliation, opposing the socialist revolution. He does not struggle against or reform the lawless capitalists, practicing class capitulationism, and has actually degenerated into a traitor of the working class, becoming the embodiment of the traitor philosophy of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

Wei Jialfa (Old Worker of No. 22 Cotton Mill): "The Nightless City" is a poisonous weed against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. It maliciously defames our workers' image and distorts our history of struggle.

We workers are tough bones and will not be as weak and helpless as Qu Haisheng, practicing capitulationism towards the bourgeoisie. Before liberation, we had gone on strike many times. In 1948, we went on strike to oppose the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the ruthless exploitation of the capitalists. The enemy sent a large number of reactionary soldiers and police to suppress us, but we were not afraid of anything. They charged in with armored cars, and we countered with large trucks; they surrounded us with machine guns, and we fought back. We did not compromise with the enemy at all. It was not like in "The Nightless City," where the strike was for economic gains and had no clear political purpose, and ended in a hasty manner. The film's depiction of the workers' negotiations with the capitalists is also a peaceful "negotiation," not a struggle at all.

The film's depiction of the "Three-Antis and Five-Antis" struggle is also very absurd. Workers do not dare to struggle against the capitalists, fearing to hurt the capitalists' "dignity," and when they go to the capitalists' homes, they are timid and act like slaves, not like the masters of the state.

Cai Zuquan (Worker Expert in Electric Light Source): "The Nightless City" is a counter-revolutionary film. It greatly advocates the theory of "extinction of class struggle," replacing class struggle with "humanity."

In the film, the distorted "worker" old Qu says to the capitalist, "The heart is made of flesh." The capitalist Zhang Boke, who has all five poisons, is moved to tears. The worker Shen Yindi is about to settle accounts with the capitalist, but the district committee's industrial department head Qu Haisheng stops her, saying that this is "making a mistake," and that the workers' old accounts "are not settled." The film openly abolishes class struggle, advocates class capitulationism, and opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a complete copy of the "Cultivation" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party on the screen.

After watching this film, we workers feel very indignant. We must thoroughly criticize the traitor philosophy and capitulation philosophy, and always remember class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Thoroughly criticize and denounce the reactionary film "The Nightless City"

Liu Lanying (National Advanced Producer, Worker of No. 12 Cotton Mill): "The Nightless City" is a counter-revolutionary film that boosts the prestige of the bourgeoisie and undermines the spirit of the proletariat. The directors advocate "exploitation is meritorious" and "rebellion is unreasonable," wanting us to abandon class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is absolutely unacceptable! We must always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, hold power firmly, use power well, and thoroughly criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and denounce the reactionary film "The Nightless City." If we do not do this, we will suffer again and live the life of being oppressed and exploited like cattle and horses.

Qi Rongfan (Five-Good Worker, Worker of No. 8 Steel Mill): "The Nightless City" vigorously advocates the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is reasonable" and "exploitation is meritorious" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and greatly propagates his theory of "class reconciliation" and "extinction of class struggle," aiming to make us go back on our path and be oppressed by the bourgeoisie and imperialism again. We workers will never agree to this.

Pan Guoping, Wang Xiuzhen (Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters): "The Nightless City" is a manifesto for the restoration of capitalism. The appearance of this reactionary film is not accidental. It was produced under the instructions of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and with the direct participation of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan. The film fully and concentratively embodies the reactionary thoughts of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. To uproot a tree, one must uproot its roots. Our criticism of this film must thoroughly criticize the reactionary theory of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. Otherwise, those reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" will flood again. If we go on like this, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "In a few years or ten years, or in a few decades, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a Fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly denounce the reactionary film "The Nightless City," and thoroughly criticize and denounce the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat to the death!

    《不夜城》是宣扬阶级投降主义的大毒草
    ——上海工人怒斥反动影片《不夜城》
    一九五八年，反动影片《不夜城》在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下炮制出笼了。这部反动影片，无耻美化资产阶级，恶毒污蔑工人阶级，鼓吹党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“剥削有功”的反动谬论，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
    最近上海工人举行座谈会，口诛笔伐反动影片《不夜城》。现在将座谈会部分发言摘要发表如下。
    美化资产阶级，为资本主义复辟制造舆论杨富珍（全国劳动模范、国棉一厂工人）、程德旺（五好职工、三轮车工人）：看了《不夜城》，我们工人都气炸了。这部反动影片的编导者顽固地站在资产阶级的立场上，为资本家歌功颂德，把那些吸血鬼、寄生虫美化成“英雄”，真是颠倒黑白，反动透顶。影片把依靠帝国主义发了家的反动资本家张伯韩打扮成“勤俭”起家的“爱国”的“红色资本家”，写他敢于坦白五毒行为，乐于要求公私合营，甚至跳着“男欢女喜”，高高兴兴地进入社会主义。天下哪有这样的事情？
    资本家就是压迫和剥削我们工人的。反动影片《不夜城》美化资产阶级，掩盖它的阶级本质，鼓吹党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派“剥削有功”的反动谬论，就是为资本主义复辟制造舆论。他们妄想让张伯韩这样的资本家再来压迫我们，骑在我们工人头上，叫我们再吃第二遍苦。我们工人一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    赵珍娣（五好职工、国棉二十二厂工人）：反动影片《不夜城》鼓吹党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“剥削有功”的反动理论，作者把资本家打扮得那么“进步”，对社会那么有“贡献”，写他们“勤俭节约”、“吃辛吃苦”，对工人是那么“关心”……真是活见鬼。
    天下乌鸦一般黑。资产阶级对工人剥削最狠毒。解放前我们厂里有个资本家，平时装得也象张耀堂一样，布衣布鞋，阿弥陀佛。可是他什么剥削的事情都做得出来。资本家从来不会同情我们工人的。那时我母亲怀了孕还得照样干重活，产后三天不能来上班，马上被资本家开除了。我自己十一岁进纱厂当童工也受尽折磨。我在厂里做了二十二个月的工，没有拿到一分钱。十六岁前，我没有穿过一件棉衣。我成年以后，每天工作十个多小时，只能拿到一、二角钱。资本家打骂工人，更是家常便饭。我们许多姊妹，至今身上还留有伤疤。我们有多少阶级兄弟姊妹，被他们逼得家破人亡，妻离子散。哪有《不夜城》里那样“好”的资本家呀！《不夜城》把资本家说得那么好，完全是造谣。
    倪海宝（全国劳动模范、国棉九厂工人）：这部影片为资本家歌功颂德，简直到了肉麻的地步。影片里当工人银娣被飞梭击伤之后，资本家忽然“良心”发现，亲自到医院去探望，并且还悔恨交加地流下了眼泪。资本家怎么会这样爱护工人，这真是胡说八道！
    过去，我们厂里有一位织布老工人，被飞梭打中了眼睛，鲜血直流，眼珠掉下，伤势十分严重。厂里的阶级姐妹都非常焦急，纷纷去探望。但资本家根本就不问。资本家把工人当作牛马，那里有这么多的“人情味”！
    反动影片《不夜城》把残酷成性的资本家打扮成“大善人”，还要我们挖出资产阶级“心里的宝贝”，要我们把资本家“带进社会主义”。影片掩盖剥削阶级的本质，鼓吹“合二而一”，反对社会主义革命，反对无产阶级专政，就是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    歪曲工人阶级的伟大形象，宣扬阶级投降主义
    唐应斌（全国劳动模范、江南造船厂工人工程师）：《不夜城》是一部彻头彻尾的反革命影片。它歪曲工人阶级形象，宣扬阶级投降主义。影片把我们工人歪曲成不敢斗争，没有出息的人。影片中的老瞿，跟资本家张伯韩一个鼻孔出气，没有我们工人阶级半点骨气。他奉承拍马，一副奴才相。他的那个儿子瞿海生，在解放前名义上是工人运动的领导者，实际上是个十足的右倾机会主义分子。他被开除了也不敢对资本家展开斗争。解放后，他挂了区委工业部长的招牌，鼓吹阶级调和论，反对社会主义革命。他对不法资本家不斗争、不改造，实行阶级投降主义，实际上他已经堕落为工人阶级的叛徒，成为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派叛徒哲学的化身。
    魏家法（国棉二十二厂老工人）：《不夜城》是一株反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大毒草。它恶意丑化我们工人形象，歪曲我们的斗争史。
    我们工人阶级是硬骨头，绝不象瞿海生那样软弱无能、对资产阶级实行投降主义。解放以前，我们曾经进行过多次罢工斗争。一九四八年，我们为了反对国民党反动派的统治，反对资本家的残酷剥削，举行了罢工。敌人派出大批反动军警来镇压，我们什么都不怕。他们用装甲车冲进来，我们用大卡车顶上去；他们用机关枪包围我们，我们就与他们斗争。我们丝毫也没有与敌人妥协。根本不象《不夜城》那样，罢工为了搞经济主义，完全没有明确的政治目的，闹了一下，就草草收场。影片写工人与资本家的谈判斗争，也是温良恭俭让的“和平谈判”，根本不象斗争。
    影片中描写的三反五反斗争，也是十分荒谬的。工人对资本家根本不敢斗争，唯恐伤了资本家的“尊严”，到资本家家里去时，畏畏缩缩，一副奴才的样子，哪里象是国家的主人。
    蔡祖泉（工人电光源专家）：《不夜城》是一部反革命影片。它大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，用“人性感化”代替阶级斗争。
    在影片里，被歪曲得不象样子的“工人”老瞿，向资本家说：“人心是肉长的。”五毒俱全的资本家张伯韩听了，竟然感动得掉下了眼泪。工人沈银娣刚刚要向资本家算算账，区委工业部长瞿海生就阻止，说这是“要犯错误”的，又说什么工人的旧账“不算了”。影片公然取消阶级斗争，鼓吹阶级投降主义，反对无产阶级专政。这完完全全是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》在银幕上的翻版。
    看了这部影片，我们工人感到非常气愤。我们要彻底批判叛徒哲学和投降哲学，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。
    彻底批臭反动影片《不夜城》
    刘兰英（全国先进生产者、国棉十二厂工人）：《不夜城》是一部长资产阶级威风，灭无产阶级志气的反革命影片。影片的编导者宣扬“剥削有功”“造反无理”，要我们放弃阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级专政，这是万万办不到的！我们就要念念不忘无产阶级专政，掌好权，用好权，狠狠批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，打倒反动影片《不夜城》。不这样做，我们就要吃二遍苦，重新过被压迫被剥削的牛马生活。
    戚荣繁（五好职工、上钢八厂工人）：《不夜城》竭力鼓吹党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“剥削有理”“剥削有功”的反动谬论，大肆宣扬他的“阶级调和”论和“阶级斗争熄灭”论，目的是叫我们走回头路，重新受资产阶级和帝国主义的压迫。我们工人坚决不答应。
    潘国平、王秀珍（上海工人革命造反总司令部）：《不夜城》是一部资本主义复辟的宣言书。这部反动影片出笼不是偶然的事情。它是根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，在反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬、夏衍直接参与下炮制出来的。影片全面地集中地体现了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动思想。刨树要刨根，我们批判这部影片，就必须彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动理论。否则，那些什么“剥削有功”的反革命谬论又会泛滥成灾，这样下去就会象毛主席所指出的那样：“少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反动电影《不夜城》彻底批臭，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派彻底批倒批臭，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政！
