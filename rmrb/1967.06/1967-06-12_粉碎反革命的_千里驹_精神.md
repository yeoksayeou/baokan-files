The reactionary film "Against the Wind for a Thousand Li" is a poisonous weed that defames the People's Liberation Army, glorifies the reactionary Nationalist Army, and summons the spirits of the defeated reactionary forces. The film vigorously promotes the "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit, which is the reactionary spirit of the bourgeoisie stubbornly attempting to restore capitalism.

The film portrays the Nationalist Army's "Thousand-Li Steed" Division, which was defeated by our army and reduced to a state of panic, as a "victorious and formidable" force. It depicts captured Nationalist officers as "unyielding" and "united" heroes. This is a complete distortion of facts and a rewriting of history.

What was the actual situation?

I personally participated in the battle to annihilate the Nationalist "Thousand-Li Steed" Division. At that time, under the correct leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, we firmly implemented Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic and tactical thoughts. We voluntarily abandoned some areas to lure the enemy in. When our army carried out a strategic retreat, the enemy indeed appeared formidable, especially the so-called "Thousand-Li Steed" 25th Division, which was even more arrogant and overbearing. Our army took advantage of the enemy's fatal weakness of arrogance and lured them into a deep encirclement. When they fell into the "pocket" we had set up in the Xinkailing area according to our plan, we delivered a devastating blow to the enemy's 25th Division. The enemy was completely annihilated, and even the division commander Li Damaba, disguised as a cook, was captured. From top to bottom, the captured soldiers were terrified, far from having any "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit. They were like homeless dogs, and their former "heroic spirit" was completely shattered.

The directors and screenwriters of "Against the Wind for a Thousand Li" distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, and spared no effort to concoct a "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit to boost the enemy's morale and demoralize our army. Their intentions are extremely malicious.

"Against the Wind for a Thousand Li" was filmed in 1962. At that time, domestic and foreign ghosts and snakes emerged together, launching a chorus of anti-communist and anti-China propaganda. The Chiang Kai-shek gangster clique raged about "reconquering the mainland," and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were also stirring. At this time, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party and their lackeys thought that the time to restore capitalism had come. They jumped out one by one, bare-chested and ready for battle. "Against the Wind for a Thousand Li" emerged at this time, vigorously promoting the undying "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit, repeatedly emphasizing the enemy's initiative, leading our army by the nose, and even the captives could force our army to surrender. How arrogant! While the soldiers escorting the captives were in a "surrounded by enemies" situation, our military personnel became "cowards" who were panic-stricken in dangerous situations, showing a defeated appearance. From this, it is not difficult to see that the film is entirely serving the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party who are usurping the party, the government, and the army. It attempts to shake people's faith in the dictatorship of the proletariat, especially in the People's Liberation Army, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. At the same time, it attempts to arm the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists with the "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit, drumming up support for this group of unrepentant reactionary classes to stage a comeback. In connection with the anti-communist and anti-China high tide launched by imperialism and revisionism together with the Chiang gangster in 1962, and the capitalist-roaders' line of "three reconciliations and one reduction, three independences and one contract," the film's blatant distortion of history and vigorous promotion of the "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit, its malicious intentions are obvious.

The "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit promoted in the reactionary film "Against the Wind for a Thousand Li" is the counter-revolutionary spirit of the bourgeoisie restoring capitalism. The film speaks for the hearts of China's Khrushchev and his gang in carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration. Listen, one openly calls on the reactionary classes to carry forward the "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat; the other bluntly states that Communist Party members should not engage in class struggle and betray the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their lyrics may not be exactly the same, but they are completely in the same tune. Therefore, "Against the Wind for a Thousand Li" emerging at this time is not just a matter of a film, but a poisonous weed created to create public opinion to accompany the counter-revolutionary restoration.

We, the People's Liberation Army, are the great people's army created by the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, resolutely smash the anti-party and anti-people "reverse wind" stirred up by the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, and thoroughly smash the "Thousand-Li Steed" spirit of restoring capitalism!

    粉碎反革命的“千里驹”精神
    解放军某师政治部副主任　于强国
    反动影片《逆风千里》是一部丑化中国人民解放军，竭力美化国民党反动军队，为被摧毁了的反动军队招魂的大毒草。影片竭力宣扬的“千里驹”精神，就是资产阶级顽强地要复辟资本主义的反动精神。
    影片把被我军打得焦头烂额的蒋介石的反动军队“千里驹”师描写成“威武雄壮”的“胜利之师”；把被我军俘虏的国民党反动军官写成“宁死不屈”“精诚团结”的“盖世英雄”。这完全是颠倒事实，篡改历史。
    事实究竟是怎样的呢？
    我亲自参加了歼灭国民党“千里驹”师的战斗。当时，我们在林彪同志的正确领导下，坚决地贯彻了毛主席的英明的战略战术思想，主动地放弃了一些地方，诱敌深入。在我军实行战略转移的时候，敌人的确是气势汹汹，特别是号称“千里驹”的二十五师，更是趾高气扬，不可一世。我军正是利用敌人这种骄横跋扈的致命弱点，诱其孤军深入，当它按照我们的意图，钻进了我们在新开岭地区布置好的“口袋”时，给了敌二十五师毁灭性打击。敌人全军覆灭，连化装成伙夫的师长李大麻子也当了俘虏。俘虏从上到下，吓得魂不附体，那里还有什么“千里驹”精神，一个个如丧家之犬，昔日的“英雄气概”扫地以尽。
    《逆风千里》的编导者颠倒是非，混淆黑白，不遗余力地编出一套“千里驹”精神来长敌人威风，灭我军志气，其用意是十分险恶的。
    《逆风千里》拍摄于一九六二年。那时候，国内外牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼，搞起了反共反华大合唱。蒋介石匪帮疯狂地叫嚣要“反攻大陆”，地富反坏右也蠢蠢欲动。这时，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的娄罗们认为复辟资本主义的“时机已到”，于是一个个跳将出来，赤膊上阵。《逆风千里》在这时出笼，大肆宣扬“千里驹”精神不死，一再渲染敌人处处主动，牵着我军的鼻子走，甚至俘虏们还可以向我逼降，气焰何其嚣张！而押送俘虏的我军则陷于“四面楚歌”的境地，我军指战员都成了在危险关头惊惶失措的“胆小鬼”，一副败相。从这里不难看出，影片完全是为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党篡政篡军服务的。它企图从政治上、思想上动摇人民对无产阶级专政，特别是对无产阶级专政的柱石人民解放军的坚强信念。同时，企图从政治上、思想上用“千里驹”精神去武装地富反坏右，为这一帮不甘心灭亡的反动阶级搞复辟擂鼓助威。联系一九六二年帝国主义和修正主义以及蒋匪帮一起掀起的反共反华高潮，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派推行“三和一少”、“三自一包”的修正主义政治路线，影片这样明目张胆地篡改历史，大肆鼓吹“千里驹”精神，其险恶用心不是昭然若揭吗？
    反动影片《逆风千里》中所宣扬的“千里驹”精神，就是资产阶级复辟资本主义的反革命精神。影片说出了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙搞反革命复辟的心声。听，一个公开号召反动阶级发扬“千里驹”精神，起来颠覆无产阶级专政；一个则直言不讳地要共产党员不搞阶级斗争，背叛无产阶级专政。他们的唱词尽管不尽一样，却完全是同一个调子。因此，《逆风千里》这时出笼，绝非一部电影的问题，而是为了配合反革命复辟制造舆论的大毒草。
    我们人民解放军是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的伟大的人民军队。毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的这一教导，坚决摧垮党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派刮起的反党反人民的“逆风”，彻底粉碎复辟资本主义的“千里驹”精神！
