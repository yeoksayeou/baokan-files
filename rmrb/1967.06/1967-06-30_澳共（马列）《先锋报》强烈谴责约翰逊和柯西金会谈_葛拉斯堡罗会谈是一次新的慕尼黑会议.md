	The recent secret talks between U.S. imperialist head Johnson and Soviet revisionist head Kosygin in New York clearly show that the ruling classes of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are in close collusion. The article says that this meeting is as dangerous and infamous as the Munich Conference of 1938.

	The article says that the purpose of the Johnson-Kosygin collusion is to make Kosygin betray the Arab people and the Vietnamese people. The Middle East and Vietnam are the key areas of people's struggles in the world today. Betraying the people in these two places is a betrayal of all oppressed peoples in the world, because these two places are on the front lines of the struggle.

	The article says that betraying the struggle of the Arab people is to facilitate the betrayal of the Vietnamese people. It is nothing more than creating a so-called "peaceful" example in the Middle East, which is actually a false peace.

	The article emphasizes that the Vietnamese people are fighting against U.S. imperialism and are making the U.S. imperialists flee in disarray. The purpose of the Johnson-Kosygin talks this time is to make Kosygin obtain "some" things he can use as bait to further betray the interests of the Vietnamese people. But this will not succeed.

	The article points out that the world has changed. People have awakened and are winning great victories. The Chinese people, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have further armed themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The doom of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is already sealed.

	The article concludes by calling on the Australian people to draw profound lessons from the recent global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and to fight more vigorously than ever against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

    澳共（马列）《先锋报》强烈谴责约翰逊和柯西金会谈
    葛拉斯堡罗会谈是一次新的慕尼黑会议
    新华社墨尔本二十九日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》二十九日发表文章说，美帝国主义头子约翰逊和苏修头目柯西金不久前在纽约举行的秘密会谈清楚表明，美苏两国的统治集团之间勾结得十分紧密。文章说，这个会谈完全象一九三八年举行的慕尼黑会议一样危险和臭名远扬。
    文章说，约翰逊和柯西金勾结的明确目的就是要柯西金叛卖阿拉伯人民和越南人民。中东和越南“这两个地方是今天世界上人民斗争的关键地方。对这两个地方的人民的叛卖就是对全世界被压迫人民的叛卖，因为这两个地方处在斗争的前线。”
    文章说，叛卖阿拉伯人民的斗争就是为了便于叛卖越南人民。它无非是要在中东制造一个所谓出现了“和平”的“榜样”，实际上，这是一种假和平。
    文章强调指出，越南人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，正在把美帝国主义打得抱头鼠窜。约翰逊和柯西金这次会谈的目的，就是要使柯西金取得“某些”他可以用作诱饵的“东西”，以便他进一步出卖越南人民的利益。但是，这是决不能得逞的。
    文章指出，现在，世界已经不同了。人民觉醒了，并且正在赢得巨大的胜利。中国人民经过无产阶级文化大革命，进一步用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了起来。美帝国主义和苏修灭亡的命运已经是注定了。
    文章最后号召澳大利亚人民从美苏最近进行的全球性大勾结中吸取深刻的教训，比以前任何时候更加斗志昂扬地进行反对美帝国主义和苏修的斗争。
