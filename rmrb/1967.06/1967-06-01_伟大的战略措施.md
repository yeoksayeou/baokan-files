A Great Strategic Measure

*Red Flag* Magazine and *People's Daily* Editorial

On June 1, 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao decided to publish the first nationwide Marxist-Leninist big-character poster from Peking University on the radio and in newspapers. This was a great strategic measure.

This great strategic measure was a direct call to arms to the entire Party and the people of the nation. It called on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to launch a mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the bottom up, to expose and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to smash the capitalist restoration plot, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

This great strategic measure ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. From then on, a magnificent mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept across the nation.

This great strategic measure pointed out to the people of the nation the main targets, the path, and the methods of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, ultimately comes down to the struggle between the proletariat to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. This struggle is concentrated in the struggle between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have infiltrated the leadership organs of the Party and the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat and have seized the leadership in some regions and departments. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, don the cloak of Marxism, but engage in revisionist activities, and under the signboard of the dictatorship of the proletariat, they practice bourgeois dictatorship. The big-character poster from Peking University exposed the likes of Lu Ping, Song Shuo, and Peng Peiyun. The anti-revisionist counter-revolutionary clique of Peng Zhen, and the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, are also doing the same. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to overthrow them, to expose them, to seize their power, and to thoroughly defeat them.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to mobilize the masses, to launch a mass movement, to use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the big-character posters, big debates, big discussions, and big criticisms, to carry out this great revolution. Only in this way can we break the shackles of slavery imposed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, smash the chains they have placed on the masses, and destroy their reactionary strongholds. Only in this way can we expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, whether big or small, and bury them in the vast sea of revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao's great strategic measure mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The magnificent mass movement terrified the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his accomplices, in a hurry, concocted a bourgeois reactionary line. They suppressed the masses, suppressed the revolution, strangled the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and tried to extinguish the just-emerging mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao returned to Peking and convened the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At this session, Chairman Mao published the great historical document "Bombard the Headquarters." He said: "The first nationwide Marxist-Leninist big-character poster and the editorial of the *People's Daily* are written so well! Please read this big-character poster and this editorial again. But in more than fifty days, from the central to the local levels, some leading comrades have done the opposite, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, confusing right and wrong, mixing black and white, encircling the revolutionary factions, suppressing different opinions, practicing white terror, feeling self-satisfied, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and crushing the spirit of the proletariat, how poisonous it is! Connecting with the rightist deviation in 1962 and the 'left' but rightist erroneous tendency in 1964, is it not something that can awaken people?"

Chairman Mao's big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which Chairman Mao personally presided over, deeply exposed the bourgeois reactionary line, exposed the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, illuminated the path for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to continue to advance, and greatly encouraged the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the broad masses throughout the nation. A larger-scale and more profound mass movement was launched. The Red Guard movement and revolutionary mass rallies pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high tide. The broad revolutionary masses further used the great democracy of the proletariat to launch a mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, exposing the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road hidden in every corner.

On the basis of the mass exposure of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our great leader Chairman Mao called on the revolutionary factions of the proletariat to launch a struggle for power. The storm of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai swept across the nation. From then on, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the stage of the struggle for power. The ranks of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat became even more formidable. The People's Liberation Army actively supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various places and made important contributions. In places and departments that need to seize power, revolutionary "three-in-one" provisional power organs have been established or are being prepared. In the stage of the struggle for power, various contradictions are still complex, but the targets of the struggle have become more concentrated, that is, to attack one by one the strongholds occupied by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to seize them back into the hands of the proletariat, and to force the enemy to lay down their arms.

From the decision by Chairman Mao to publish the first nationwide Marxist-Leninist big-character poster from Peking University to today, it has been exactly one year. In this one year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved brilliant victories, and the political life and social appearance of our country have undergone tremendous changes.

Summing up the experience of the struggle over the past year, all revolutionary comrades and all revolutionary mass organizations must study Chairman Mao's instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and always pay attention to grasping the general direction of the struggle.

Grasping the general direction of the struggle is to recognize the targets of the revolution, to recognize whose power to overthrow, and to direct the spearhead of the struggle at whom. Why is the first big-character poster from Peking University called Marxist-Leninist? It is because this big-character poster clearly, sharply, and unambiguously directs the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. If the general direction is wrong, then everything is wrong. On this issue, there are some unclear, ambiguous, and incorrect slogans circulating, such as "those with long names step aside," "uproot and sweep down," "direct the spearhead upwards," etc., all of which lack class analysis and are wrong. If we do it this way, without distinguishing between right and wrong, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, between the broad masses and a handful of bad elements, we will definitely make mistakes in direction.

We must recognize that after one year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed, and at the same time, it has been proven that most of our cadres are good or relatively good. In places and departments where a magnificent mass movement has been launched, generally speaking, the class lines have become clear or relatively clear. The struggle for power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat is carried out under these conditions. All revolutionary mass organizations should actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, unite, and complete the task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In this process, we must politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrow and expose the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in our units and regions, and gradually complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units. Through the great criticism, we must achieve revolutionary great unity and, through the great criticism, raise our level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, truly seize power for the proletariat.

Grasping the general direction of the struggle is inseparable from correctly recognizing and using great democracy. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Democracy is sometimes seen as a goal, but in reality, it is only a means." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what do we use the means of great democracy for? Who do we use it against? What is the goal? Our great democracy is to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to open fire on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must use the means of great democracy to arouse the masses to achieve the goal of exposing and overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Without this goal, we will lose our direction, it will not be proletarian democracy, and it will be used by the class enemy. If we treat democracy as a goal, we will go down the bourgeois path.

Grasping the general direction of the struggle is inseparable from correctly recognizing and handling two types of contradictions of different natures. All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary mass organizations must not only learn to handle contradictions between the enemy and us but also learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people. At any time, under any circumstances, we must not direct the spearhead of the struggle at the broad masses and the broad cadres. For the masses who have been deceived, we must not direct the spearhead of the struggle at them, but we should patiently and meticulously do political and ideological work with them, persuade them, educate them, and help them put down their burdens, correct their mistakes, and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The leftist factions and leftist mass organizations must learn this hard skill of doing mass work. The contradictions among the leftist organizations must be resolved using democratic methods and the policy of "unity-criticism-unity." If we do not direct the spearhead of the struggle at the enemy but at the masses who have different opinions, and fight "internal wars" among the leftist organizations, this will divert the general direction of the struggle and make the class enemy happy.

To grasp the general direction of the struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, carry out rectification, seize the power of the "self" in our minds, and resolutely oppose anarchism. Too many selfish thoughts make it impossible to grasp the general direction of the struggle, and not overcoming anarchism also makes it impossible to grasp the general direction of the struggle. This is especially important to note in the process of the struggle for power and after seizing power. If we do not overcome selfish thoughts, in the process of the struggle for power, we will turn the proletariat's struggle for power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road into a struggle for power among small groups and individuals, and after seizing power, we will not be able to carry out and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If we do not overcome anarchist thoughts, in the process of the struggle for power, we will commit serious errors of destroying proletarian revolutionary discipline and destroying the dictatorship of the proletariat, and after seizing power, we will create independent kingdoms. All revolutionary comrades must be highly vigilant and not be led astray by the "self" and anarchist thoughts.

Chairman Mao pointed out: Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution. At the time of the one-year anniversary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching and firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle.

    伟大的战略措施
    《红旗》杂志　《人民日报》社论
    一九六六年六月一日，我们的伟大领袖毛主席决定在广播电台和报纸上发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义大字报。这是一个伟大的战略措施。
    这个伟大的战略措施，是向全党和全国人民直接发出的战斗号令。它号召无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，自下而上地开展无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，揭露和斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为粉碎资本主义复辟阴谋，巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。
    这个伟大的战略措施，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。从此，一场波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    这个伟大的战略措施，向全国人民指明了无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，革命的道路和方法。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，归根结底，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政而资产阶级要颠覆无产阶级专政的斗争。这种斗争，集中地表现为无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争。
    混进党的领导机关内部和无产阶级专政机构内部的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，窃取了一些地区、一些部门的领导权。他们打着红旗反红旗，披着马克思主义的外衣，干的是修正主义的勾当，挂着无产阶级专政的招牌，实行的是资产阶级专政。北京大学第一张马列主义的大字报揭露出来的陆平、宋硕、彭珮云之流，就是这样干的。彭真反革命修正主义集团，他们的后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，也是这样干的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要革他们的命，就是要把他们揭露出来，夺他们的权，把他们彻底打倒。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是要放手发动群众，开展群众运动，就是要运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，即大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报等，来进行这场大革命。只有这样，才能冲破党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派贩卖的奴隶主义的束缚，打碎他们加在群众头上的枷锁，摧毁他们的反动堡垒。只有这样，才能把党内一小撮或大或小的走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，使他们暴露在光天化日之下，埋葬在革命群众的汪洋大海之中。
    毛主席的伟大战略措施，调动了亿万革命群众向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动猛烈的攻击。轰轰烈烈的群众运动使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派吓破了胆。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其同伙，迫不及待地炮制了一条资产阶级反动路线。他们镇压群众，镇压革命，扼杀无产阶级专政下的大民主，要扑灭这场刚刚兴起的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动。
    正在这样一个关键的时刻，我们的伟大领袖毛主席回到北京，召开了党的八届十一中全会。在这次全会上，毛主席发表了具有伟大历史意义的《炮打司令部》的大字报。他说：“全国第一张马列主义的大字报和人民日报评论员的评论，写得何等好呵！请同志们重读一遍这张大字报和这个评论。可是在五十多天里，从中央到地方的某些领导同志，却反其道而行之，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”
    毛主席的大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，深刻地揭露了资产阶级反动路线，揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命继续前进的道路，极大地鼓舞了全国的无产阶级革命派和广大群众。一个规模更大的、内容更深刻的群众运动开展起来了。红卫兵运动和革命的大串连，把无产阶级文化大革命推向了新的高潮。广大革命群众，进一步运用无产阶级大民主，对资产阶级反动路线展开了群众性的大批判，把隐藏在各个角落里的走资本主义道路的当权派，揭露了出来。
    在对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行群众性揭露的基础上，我们的伟大领袖毛主席号召无产阶级革命派展开夺权斗争。上海兴起的“一月革命”的风暴，席卷全国。从此，无产阶级文化大革命进入了夺权斗争的阶段。无产阶级革命派的队伍更加壮大了。中国人民解放军积极支援各地的无产阶级文化大革命，作出了重要贡献。那些需要夺权的地方和部门，已经建立或者正在筹备建立革命的“三结合”临时权力机构。在夺权斗争阶段中，各种矛盾还是错综复杂的，但是，斗争目标更加集中了，这就是逐个地攻克被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派盘踞的堡垒，把它夺回到无产阶级手里，迫使敌人最后缴械。
    毛主席决定发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义大字报到今天，整整一年了。在这一年当中，无产阶级文化大革命取得了辉煌的胜利，我国的政治生活和社会面貌发生了天翻地覆的大变化。
    总结一年来的斗争经验，一切革命同志，一切革命群众组织，都必须学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的指示，时时刻刻地注意掌握斗争的大方向。
    掌握斗争的大方向，就是认清革命对象的问题，认清革谁的命的问题，把斗争的矛头指向谁的问题。为什么说北京大学的第一张大字报是马列主义的呢？就是因为这张大字报，是把斗争矛头明确地、尖锐地、毫不含糊地指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。如果大方向错了，那就一切都错了。在这个问题上，流传着一些不明确的、含糊的、不正确的口号。例如“带长字的靠边站”，“上揪下扫”，“矛头向上”等等，都是缺乏阶级分析的，都是错误的。如果这样去做，不分青红皂白，不分无产阶级还是资产阶级，不分无产阶级司令部还是资产阶级司令部，不分广大群众还是一小撮坏人，就一定要犯方向的错误。
    我们必须认识到，经过一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派被揭露出来了，同时，证明了我们的干部大多数是好的和比较好的。开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动的地方和部门，一般说来，阶级阵线是已经清楚了或者比较清楚了。无产阶级革命派夺权斗争，就是在这种条件下进行的。一切革命群众组织，应当积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，联合起来，完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的任务。在这个过程中，要把已经被揭露出来的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，本单位、本地区的走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒，批臭，逐步完成本单位的斗、批、改的任务。在大批判中实现革命的大联合，并且要通过大批判，来提高自己的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的水平，真正为无产阶级掌好权。
    掌握斗争的大方向，同正确认识和使用大民主是分不开的。毛主席教导我们说：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们用大民主这个手段干什么呢？对付谁呢？要达到什么目的呢？我们的大民主，就是要发动亿万群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火。我们就是要用大民主这个手段，唤起群众，达到揭露和打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的目的。离开了这个目的，就迷失了方向，就不是无产阶级的民主，就会被阶级敌人所利用。如果把民主当做目的，就会走到资产阶级的邪路上去。
    掌握斗争的大方向，是同正确地认识和处理两类不同性质的矛盾分不开的。一切革命的同志，革命的群众组织，不但要学会处理敌我矛盾，而且要学会正确地处理人民内部矛盾。在任何时候，在任何情况下，都不能把斗争的矛头指向广大群众，指向广大干部。对于受蒙蔽的群众，也不能把斗争的矛头指向他们，而应该耐心地细致地向他们作政治思想工作，说服他们，教育他们，帮助他们放下包袱、改正错误，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。左派和左派群众组织，必须学会这种做群众工作的过硬本领。左派组织之间的矛盾，更必须用民主的方法，用“团结——批评——团结”的方针来解决。如果不把斗争矛头指向敌人，而是指向有不同意见的群众，在左派组织之间打“内战”，这就转移了斗争大方向，使阶级敌人高兴。
    要掌握斗争大方向，必须活学活用毛主席著作，进行整风，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，坚决反对无政府主义。私心杂念太多，是不能掌握斗争大方向的，不克服无政府主义，也是不能掌握斗争大方向的。这一点，在夺权斗争过程中和掌权以后，尤其需要注意。如果不克服私心杂念，在夺权斗争过程中，就会把无产阶级向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，变成为小团体、为个人的争权夺利，而在掌权以后，也决不能贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。如果不克服无政府主义思想，在夺权斗争过程中，就会犯破坏无产阶级革命纪律，破坏无产阶级专政的严重错误，在掌权以后，就会搞独立王国。一切革命的同志，都必须高度的警惕，不要被“私”字，被无政府主义思想，引到邪路上去。
    毛主席指出：谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动一周年的时候，我们应当牢牢记住毛主席的这个教导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。
