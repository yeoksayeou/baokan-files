Hong Kong workers from twenty units, including maritime transport, land and water transport, public utilities, shipyards, and textiles, participating in the united strike, have repeatedly thwarted the threats of violence, kidnappings by spies, and a series of deceptive tactics employed by the Hong Kong British authorities and British capitalists to sabotage the strike. They have steadfastly continued their strike, delivering a heavy blow to British imperialism.

To salvage the already paralyzed port, the Hong Kong British authorities and British capitalists collaborated, dispatching a large number of spies and armed police to threaten workers at Kowloon Dock and Sun Hung Kai & Co. and other tugboat and dock workers to resume work. However, the workers resolutely declared: "Even with a gun to my head, I won't go back to work!" The enemy then used "suspension of duties" to intimidate them. The workers responded: "We, the working class, fear neither heaven nor earth, nor even death. What are we afraid of 'suspension of duties'? To defend Mao Zedong Thought and to uphold national dignity, we must fight British imperialism to the end!" The workers now gather at their unions every day to attend denunciation meetings and study Chairman Mao's quotations. They say: "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to fight and expose British imperialism!"

Due to the workers' persistence in the strike, many places have fallen into chaos. In recent days, Hong Kong's cargo transport has been in a state of near paralysis.

The strike by electric and telephone workers has tightly gripped the throat of Hong Kong's public utilities, causing the British authorities to panic. On the first day of the strike, the British authorities sent a large number of plainclothes spies to the workers' dormitories, threatening and beating them with guns, attempting to force them back to work. This was met with resolute resistance from the workers. Due to the strike by workers at the Hong Kong Electric Company and the China Light and Power Company, some power plants were in extreme chaos. More than 80% of the workers at the China Light and Power Company participated in the strike, leaving the British authorities to hastily find people to maintain the power generation department's work, while other departments' work completely halted.

The public bus and tram workers, who have paralyzed land transportation in Hong Kong and Kowloon, have also thwarted the British authorities' sabotage plots. After the strike began, the British authorities sent a large number of spies and incited a small group of traitors to threaten and bribe the bus workers, but all were met with stern rebuke from the workers. Many workers' families also actively supported the strike actions. Due to the strike by transportation workers, Hong Kong and Kowloon's transportation has fallen into chaos.

The ferry workers have also not been intimidated by the British threats and have persisted in their strike struggle. Many workers who were forced to resume work at the "Auburn" ferry have returned to the strike ranks in recent days.

The strike by workers in Hong Kong British institutions and some British-owned enterprises, which began on June 10, has seen an increasing number of participants in recent days.

### 不断粉碎各种破坏阴谋，再次沉重打击英帝  香港工人不屈不挠坚持联合大罢工

    不断粉碎各种破坏阴谋，再次沉重打击英帝
    香港工人不屈不挠坚持联合大罢工
    据新华社香港二十九日电　香港海运、水陆交通、公用事业、船坞、纺织业等二十个单位参加联合大罢工的工人，不断击破港英当局和英国资本家的武力威胁、特务绑架和拉拢欺骗等一连串破坏大罢工的阴谋，坚持罢工斗争，给了英帝国主义以沉重打击。
    为了挽救已经陷于瘫痪的海港，港英当局和英国资本家互相勾结，派出大批特务和武装警察，威胁九龙仓、均益仓的工人和其他拖轮、码头的起卸工人开工，但工人们坚定地说：用枪指着我也不开工！敌人又用“停职处分”来进行恐吓。工人们说：我们工人阶级天不怕，地不怕，死也不怕，难道还怕什么“停职处分”？为了保卫毛泽东思想，为了维护民族尊严，我们一定要与万恶的英帝国主义斗争到底！工人们现在每天都到自己的工会，参加控诉会和学习毛主席语录。他们说：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们必须活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想做武器，斗垮斗臭英帝国主义！
    由于工人坚持罢工，许多地方陷于一片混乱。这几天，香港货运已处于半死不活的状态。
    电灯、电话工人的罢工，紧紧地掐住港英公用事业的咽喉，使港英当局惊惶失措。在罢工的第一天，港英就派出大批便衣特务到工人宿舍，用手枪威吓并殴打工人，企图胁迫工人复工，遭到工人的坚决抵抗。由于香港电灯公司和九龙中华电力公司的工人坚持罢工，有的发电厂情况极为混乱。中华电力公司百分之八十以上的工人参加罢工，港英只能临时找些人来维持发电部门的工作，其他部门的工作则全部停顿。
    使港九陆上交通陷于瘫痪的公共汽车和电车工人，也击破了港英当局破坏罢工的阴谋。罢工开始后，港英当局曾派出大批特务和指使一小撮民族败类，对公共汽车工人进行威胁利诱，但都遭到了工人的严词斥责。许多工人家属也积极支持罢工行动。由于交通工人的罢工行动，港九交通已陷于混乱。
    渡海小轮工人也没有被港英的威胁所吓倒，坚持罢工斗争。“油麻地”小轮不少被胁迫开工的工人，这几天纷纷归队参加罢工行列。
    六月十日就已开始的港英机构和部分英资企业中国工人的罢工，最近参加罢工的工人继续增加。
