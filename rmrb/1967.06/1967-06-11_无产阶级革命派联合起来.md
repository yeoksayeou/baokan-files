The proletarian revolutionaries unite, and launch a great criticism and struggle—this is our current battle cry, our battle program.

The proletarian revolutionaries in the capital's literary and artistic circles have united and held a meeting to criticize and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. This meeting was held well, very well! It is a model of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries.

We have every reason to unite. Because we have a common enemy, that is, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist heads in the literary and artistic circles such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, Qi Yanming, Xiao Wangdong and their supreme backer—the Khrushchev of China. To defeat this handful of enemies and to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must unite.

We have every possibility to unite. Because we have a common guiding ideology, that is, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Although there are differences among the proletarian revolutionaries, they are all contradictions among the people. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, using the method of "unity-criticism-unity" taught by Chairman Mao, we can definitely eliminate differences and achieve revolutionary great unity.

Some people think, "To carry out great unity is to not distinguish right from wrong." Today, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle is the biggest "right"; to go against this direction of the struggle is the biggest "wrong." To carry out revolutionary great unity, grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate forces, and jointly fight the enemy, this is to distinguish the biggest "right" and "wrong." All small rights and wrongs must be subordinate to this big right and wrong. If one is entangled in small rights and wrongs and does not let go, busy with "internal warfare," this is precisely not distinguishing the big right from wrong.

Some people think, "To carry out great unity, the conditions are not ripe." To thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party is the most important condition to further promote revolutionary great unity. Is this condition not "ripe" today! If what is meant by "the conditions are not ripe" is that some revolutionary organizations have had friction in the past and thus still have some antagonistic sentiments, then this situation can definitely be changed. We can, in the process of achieving great unity, through criticism and self-criticism, eliminate these antagonistic sentiments, and in the great criticism and struggle of the revolution, establish a fighting friendship.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has developed to this day. Whether or not to carry out revolutionary great unity, whether or not to launch revolutionary great criticism and struggle, is a touchstone to test whether an organization is revolutionary or not, and it is a matter of whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be carried through to the end. All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary organizations will face a new test on this issue!

Only revolutionary great unity can promote revolutionary great criticism.

Only revolutionary great unity can concentrate firepower to overthrow and smash the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

Only revolutionary great unity can achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    无产阶级革命派联合起来
    本报评论员
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，投入革命的大批判、大斗争——这是我们当前的战斗口号，是我们的战斗纲领。
    首都文艺界无产阶级革命派联合起来，召开了斗争批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大会。这个大会开得好，好极了！这是无产阶级革命派大联合的模范。
    我们完全有理由联合起来。因为我们有共同的敌人，这就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这就是文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义头头陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭、萧望东等和他们的总后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫。为了战胜这一小撮敌人，为了赢得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，我们必须联合起来。
    我们完全有可能联合起来，因为我们有共同的指导思想，这就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。我们无产阶级革命派之间虽然有着这样或那样的分歧，但都是人民内部矛盾。在毛泽东思想的指导下，用毛主席所教导我们的“团结——批评——团结”的方法，是一定可以消除分歧，实现革命大联合的。
    有人认为，“实行大联合，就是不分是非。”在今天，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，就是最大的“是”；违背这个斗争大方向，就是最大的“非”。实行革命的大联合，掌握斗争的大方向，集中力量，共同对敌，这就分清了最大的“是”和“非”。一切小是小非，都要服从这个大是大非。如果纠缠在小是小非上不放，忙于“打内战”，这倒恰恰是不分大是大非了。
    有人认为，“实行大联合，条件不成熟。”彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是进一步促进革命大联合的最主要的条件。这个条件，今天难道还“不成熟”吗！如果所谓“条件不成熟”，指的是有些革命组织之间过去有过磨擦，因而还存在一些对立情绪的话，那么，这种状况是完全可以改变的。我们可以在实现大联合的过程中，通过批评和自我批评，消除这种对立情绪，在革命的大批判、大斗争中，建立起战斗的友谊。
    无产阶级文化大革命发展到今天，要不要革命的大联合，要不要开展革命的大批判、大斗争，是考验一个组织革命与不革命的试金石，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能不能进行到底的问题。一切革命同志、革命组织都将在这一问题上经受新考验！
    只有革命的大联合，才能推动革命的大批判。
    只有革命的大联合，才能集中火力斗倒、斗垮党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    只有革命的大联合，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
