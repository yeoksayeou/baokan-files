	Strive for Thorough Criticism and Promote Summer Harvest

	What supports the summer harvest? It is the emphasis on politics, it is the emphasis on Mao Zedong Thought.

	Four model soldiers from a reconnaissance company of the Nanjing Military Region participated in the summer harvest and guided the revolutionary masses and cadres to conduct a thorough criticism of the capitalist roaders in power within the Party. This is seizing the correct political direction. Through the criticism, the consciousness of the masses has been greatly raised, and their enthusiasm for labor has been greatly enhanced, making the summer harvest work done quickly and well.

	This is a good experience in implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution and promote production," and it is worth learning from. — Editor

	Recently, a propaganda team consisting of four model soldiers, Chen Zide, Chen Hongxi, Zhang Hongfu, and Shen Huiyong, from a reconnaissance company of the Nanjing Military Region went to the nearby Qianfan, Fengwang, and Huayuan production brigades to support the summer harvest.

	How can a team of four people support the summer harvest in an area? They reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: politics is the commander, the soul; political work is the lifeline of all economic work. They unanimously realized that if they only support the summer harvest with labor, the strength of four people is very limited; forgetting politics means losing the correct direction. Only by emphasizing politics, first supporting politically, can the strength be boundless. Politics is the struggle between classes, and the current thorough criticism and struggle against the capitalist roaders in power within the Party is the most concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. Emphasizing politics to support the summer harvest is to emphasize thorough criticism and struggle, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

	After reaching a consensus, they worked in the fields with the poor and lower-middle peasants during the day and helped them study important documents such as the Central Committee's "Notice" at night, deeply criticizing the top capitalist roader within the Party. At the same time, they also created eight cultural performances related to thorough criticism and "grasp revolution and promote production," helping the brigade's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to rehearse, and performing during rest times in the fields.

	During the criticism, many poor and lower-middle peasants used their bitter experiences in the old society to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of the top capitalist roader within the Party in attempting to restore capitalism. The struggle meeting to denounce the top capitalist roader within the Party was also a rally to "grasp revolution and promote production." A poor peasant woman from Qianfan Brigade, Jiang Xiuying, said: "China's Khrushchev and Chairman Mao are singing opposite tunes, aiming to make us poor and lower-middle peasants fall to the ground, which is absolutely impossible! We will turn hatred into strength and use the actual work of doing a good job in the summer harvest to counterattack China's Khrushchev, to counterattack the slanders of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries against our proletarian cultural revolution!" She has five children, and her husband is a construction worker, with heavy household chores. However, she leads the way in doing a good job in the summer harvest, working from early morning to late at night, and also actively participates in militia activities to defend the summer harvest.

	The revolutionary cadres of the production brigades, through thorough criticism and struggle, have shown renewed revolutionary spirit and greatly increased work enthusiasm. Brigade leader Yang Dianbiao of Fengwang Brigade was not bold and vigorous in his work for a period of time. Model soldiers Chen Zide and Zhang Hongfu, after investigation, found that there was a rich peasant element and a few bad elements colluding and causing trouble in the brigade. Brigade leader Yang Dianbiao did not have a clear understanding of the class struggle situation and lacked backbone. They then worked with the brigade's revolutionary committee to organize a struggle meeting to suppress the counter-revolutionary arrogance of those few people. This struggle also deeply educated Yang Dianbiao, making him strengthen his class struggle awareness. He excitedly said: "The class enemies will do everything possible to sabotage the summer harvest. If I relax my leadership, I will fall into the trap of the class enemies. I must do my best to do a good job in the wheat work and thoroughly smash the sabotage plots of the class enemies!" That night, he led the commune members to harvest wheat, working until 4:30 in the morning, completing the harvesting and threshing of 14 mu of wheat. Now the brigade is doing a good job in both revolution and production. The wheat has been completely threshed and winnowed, with an average yield per mu increased by 180 jin compared to last year. The summer sowing and weeding work is also done well.

	These three production brigades, by seizing the key of thorough criticism and struggle during the summer harvest, have raised the class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to a high level, fully inspired their revolutionary enthusiasm, and created a strong political atmosphere. This year's summer harvest work is better than ever before.

    狠抓大批判　大力促夏收
    支援夏收靠的是什么？靠的是突出政治，靠的是突出毛泽东思想。
    南京部队某部侦察连四个五好战士参加夏收后，引导革命群众和干部，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判，这就抓住了突出政治的大方向。通过大批判，广大群众的觉悟大大提高，劳动积极性大大增强，使夏收工作做得又快又好。
    这是贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的好经验，值得学习。　——编者
    最近，南京部队某部侦察连由陈紫德、陈宏熙、张红富、沈辉友四个五好战士组成的一个毛泽东思想宣传小组，到驻地附近钱范、冯王、花园三个生产队支援夏收工作。
    四个人的宣传组，怎样支援好一个片的夏收工作？他们重温了毛主席的教导：政治是统帅，是灵魂；政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。一致认识到：如果仅仅从劳力上支援夏收，四个人的力量是很小的，忘掉政治就会失掉大方向；只有突出政治，首先从政治上支援，力量才是无穷的。政治就是阶级对阶级的斗争，当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行的大批判、大斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的最集中的表现，是当前全国最大的政治。突出政治支援夏收，就是要突出大批判、大斗争，促进人的思想革命化。
    统一认识后，他们白天和贫下中农同收割，晚上帮助贫下中农学习中共中央的《通知》等重要文件，深刻批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。同时，他们还编了有关大批判和抓革命、促生产的八个文娱节目，帮助生产队的毛泽东思想宣传队排练，利用休息时间，在田头演出。
    在大批判中，许多贫下中农，用自己在旧社会的苦难经历，愤怒控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派大搞资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的声讨大会，同时也是“抓革命，促生产”的誓师大会。钱范生产队的贫农女社员姜秀英说：“中国的赫鲁晓夫和毛主席唱对台戏，就是要我们贫下中农人头落地，这一万个办不到！我们要化仇恨为力量，用搞好夏收的实际行动，回击中国的赫鲁晓夫，回击帝、修、反对我国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑！”她有五个小孩，丈夫是个建筑工人，家务劳动很重。但是，她起早熬晚地带头搞好夏收工作，而且还积极参加民兵活动，保卫夏收。
    生产队的革命干部，通过大批判大斗争，革命精神焕发，工作积极性大大提高。冯王生产队队长杨佃标，前一段时间工作不够大胆泼辣。五好战士陈紫德、张红富经过调查，了解到这个队有个富农分子和几个坏分子互相勾结，暗中捣鬼。队长杨佃标，对阶级斗争形势认识不清楚，腰杆儿不够硬。他们就和生产队文革委员会研究，组织了一次批判斗争会，打击了那几个家伙的反革命气焰。这场斗争也深深地教育了杨佃标，使他增强了阶级斗争观念。他激动地说：“阶级敌人要千方百计地破坏夏收，我放松领导，正中了阶级敌人的奸计。我一定要全力以赴搞好三麦工作，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋！”当天半夜，他就带领社员割麦，干到早晨四点半，把十四亩元麦割完，运上了场。现在这个队把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，把生产搞得热气腾腾。元麦已经全部打好扬净，平均亩产比去年增加一百八十斤。夏种夏锄等工作，也做得很好。
    这三个生产队，由于在夏收中，紧紧抓住了大批判、大斗争这条纲，贫下中农和革命干部的阶级觉悟提得高高的，革命干劲鼓得足足的，政治空气搞得浓浓的。今年的夏收工作，比以往任何一年搞得都好。
