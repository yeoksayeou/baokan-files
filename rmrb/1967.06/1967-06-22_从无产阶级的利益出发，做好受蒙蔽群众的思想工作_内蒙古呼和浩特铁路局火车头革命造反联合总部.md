In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is our "Locomotive" soldiers' guiding light. Its brilliant ideas guide us to correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions, to differentiate between friends and enemies, to unite the people, and to strike at the enemy. Today, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of this great work, we feel particularly close to it, and it further arouses our boundless love and admiration for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and our great leader Chairman Mao.

Charge the Account to the Capitalist-Roaders in the Party

We "Locomotive" emerged from the turbulent waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The conservative organizations standing against us are the "Red Iron Warriors."

On April 13th, the voice of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao reached us, and the revolutionary masses who had long been suppressed and persecuted rose up and seized power. After we seized power, how should we deal with the broad masses of the "Red Iron Warriors" who were misled?

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us in his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that we must first distinguish between two types of contradictions and separate enemy contradictions from contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao says: "In the present stage, in the period of socialist construction, all classes, strata, and social groups that support, advocate, and participate in the cause of socialist construction are within the ranks of the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are the enemies of the people." The handful of capitalist-roaders in our bureau's Party are the loyal henchmen of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Inner Mongolia Party, the ringleaders who incite the masses to fight the masses and carry out a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. Their contradictions with us are irreconcilable antagonistic contradictions, enemy contradictions. All accounts, big and small, should be charged to the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. The contradictions between the misled masses of the "Red Iron Warriors" and us are contradictions among the people. We firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing our spearhead at the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, and we have mercilessly exposed, criticized, and fought against the capitalist reactionary line and the big poisonous weed "Tempering," and against the handful of capitalist-roaders in Inner Mongolia and our unit.

Some comrades in the "Red Iron Warriors" have been poisoned by the reactionary "taming tool" theory, mistakenly regarding the Party committee secretary as the embodiment of the Party, and in the movement, they dare not expose and criticize, and they do not believe in the issues exposed by others. They regard the "Locomotive," which dares to rebel, as great criminals, and they are very resentful in their hearts. To help these comrades raise their consciousness, we expose, criticize, and fight against the capitalist-roaders in the Party together with them, making them see the reactionary nature of the capitalist-roaders in the Party, beginning to break free from the spiritual shackles of the big poisonous weed "Tempering," and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. There is a loader at the Hohhot Station who often curses us revolutionaries as "monsters and demons" and "counter-revolutionaries." We regard him as a misled mass and actively seek to unite with him, but he stubbornly says, "How am I wrong? Where have I been misled?" Later, the "Locomotive" soldiers presented him with this fact: During the "February Wind," the capitalist-roaders in the Party arbitrarily used his name and the names of other railway workers to issue dozens of free train tickets to their accomplices in other units, while this worker was kept in the dark the whole time. When he found out, he was shocked and began to understand the capitalist reactionary line. We started from this breakthrough and continued to do ideological work, helping him to draw a clear line with the capitalist-roaders in the Party.

Through exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the capitalist-roaders in the Party, many comrades in the "Red Iron Warriors" gradually awoke and shared common feelings and language with us. Old locomotive driver Mao Defa shed tears and said, "In the past, I believed in rumors and thought the 'Locomotive' was 'monsters and demons.' This was all the work of the capitalist-roaders in the Party. I was used by them! I wrongly stood on the side of the capitalist reactionary line, and I have let down Chairman Mao!" Many "Red Iron Warriors" launched fierce counterattacks, severely criticizing the capitalist-roaders in the Party, making this handful of people completely isolated and surrounded.

Do Painstaking and Patient Ideological Work with Enthusiasm

Chairman Mao says: "All problems of an ideological nature, all problems of controversy among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by the methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not by coercion or suppression." The vast majority of the "Red Iron Warriors" love the Party and Chairman Mao, but they have been misled and stood on the wrong side. If we do not help them free themselves from the shackles of the capitalist reactionary line, we cannot form a vast revolutionary army, we cannot isolate and strike at the handful of capitalist-roaders, and we cannot carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Due to the rampant "February Wind" in Inner Mongolia, many of our revolutionary comrades were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," and some were struggled against, arrested, imprisoned, and beaten. We harbor deep hatred for the capitalist reactionary line and have some revengeful feelings towards the conservative organization's masses. We did not fully understand Chairman Mao's warm instructions at the beginning. Under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, we studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions with questions in mind and quickly realized: The proletarian revolutionary masses should have broad minds and far-sighted vision, should consider the interests of the whole class, and should not dwell on personal grievances. The proletarian revolutionary masses who have seized power should even more strictly demand of themselves, resolutely implement the Party's policies, and unite with the vast majority of the masses to do the revolution together. Worker and "Locomotive" soldier Bi Dexin from the Hohhot Locomotive Section was once beaten by a "Red Iron Warrior." After the "Locomotive" seized power, Bi Dexin served as the orderly for the "Locomotive" combat team. The person who had beaten him was now afraid and ashamed, avoiding him and not daring to speak to him when they met. Bi Dexin took the initiative to talk to him, helping him to "unload his burden," saying, "You beat me because you were incited by bad people, and I do not take it to heart. I hope you can distinguish right from wrong and come out to rebel early." This "Red Iron Warrior" was deeply moved and apologized to Bi Dexin, had a heart-to-heart talk with him, and later actively applied to join the "Locomotive."

To help people, one must help their hearts. Some "Red Iron Warriors" are deeply misled, and in the process of transformation, they may waver, declaring withdrawal from the conservative organization one day and rejoining the next, or having "three ins and three outs." The fundamental reason for their wavering is that their ideological problems have not been truly resolved. For such comrades, on the one hand, we do not discriminate against or mock them; on the other hand, we do more painstaking and detailed ideological work, helping them to distinguish between right and wrong, and establishing the absolute dominance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in their minds. There is an old worker-turned-technician in the Communications Section who has long been misled. When he began to awaken, a countercurrent of revenge swept through society, and the capitalist-roaders in the Party took the opportunity to incite, saying, "Be careful, the 'Locomotive' is going to persecute the masses." This confused him, and his previous wrong ideas surfaced again. He questioned the "Locomotive" comrades, "Are you going to persecute people?" We said, "This is a rumor. You are a misled mass. Why would we persecute you?" He was still half-believing, half-doubting. However, the "Locomotive" members not only did not persecute him but also actively approached him, patiently explained the situation to him, and reasoned with him. This technician finally realized that he had been misled. He wept bitterly, checked himself, and said that this time he had truly made up his mind. He also actively dispelled rumors for other "Red Iron Warriors," using his own experiences to persuade them. Many "Red Iron Warriors" have an even deeper love and support for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Achieve True Unity in Struggle

Chairman Mao says: "The correct things always develop in the process of struggling against the incorrect things. The true, the good, and the beautiful always exist and develop in comparison and struggle with the false, the evil, and the ugly." We firmly believe that the misled masses are class brothers who can be united, educated, and won over, but we have differences with them on many major issues. Some of them, if they do not clarify their thoughts and change their stance, will not truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, we must "start from the desire for unity, go through criticism or struggle to resolve contradictions, and thus achieve new unity on a new basis."

At first, many comrades were full of resentment towards the conservative masses and their leaders, unwilling to talk to them, calling them "old conservatives" and "diehards." If they did not launch counterattacks, they were called "stubborn"; if they did launch counterattacks, they were called "political opportunists" and "trying to grab straws." This understanding is very wrong, one of the reasons being the lack of a desire for unity. Later, this understanding was corrected, and ideological work among the misled masses was widely carried out. However, some "Locomotive" soldiers, when doing ideological work, did not insist on principles, and the slogan "big brother, little brother, almost the same, your mistakes are bigger, mine are smaller" appeared. In this way, we could not truly help the misled masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We learned from this lesson, insisted on presenting facts and reasoning on some principle issues, and thus achieved the goal of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades.

Now, the conservative organization "Red Iron Warriors" has dissolved. Many "Red Iron Warriors" have joined the "Locomotive." We "Locomotive" soldiers are now, together with the awakened masses, advancing victoriously along the track of Mao Zedong Thought, "grasp revolution and promote production."

    从无产阶级的利益出发，做好受蒙蔽群众的思想工作
    内蒙古呼和浩特铁路局火车头革命造反联合总部
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部伟大著作是我们“火车头”战士的指路明灯。它的光辉思想指导我们正确区别两类不同性质的矛盾，分清敌友，团结人民，打击敌人。今天，我们纪念这部伟大著作发表十周年，感到分外亲切，更加激起了我们对光焰无际的毛泽东思想，对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜的心情。
    把账记在党内走资本主义道路当权派的身上
    我们“火车头”是在无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪中杀出来的。站在我们对立面的保守派组织，是“红铁战士”。
    今年四月十三日，党中央和毛主席的声音传来了，长期遭受打击、摧残的革命派翻了身，掌了权。我们掌权以后，应该怎样对待“红铁战士”中受蒙蔽的广大群众呢？
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部光辉著作中教导我们，首先要分清两类不同性质的矛盾，把敌我矛盾同人民内部矛盾区别开来。毛主席说：“在现阶段，在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”我局党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是内蒙古地区党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的忠实爪牙，是挑动群众斗群众、大搞资本主义反革命复辟的罪魁祸首。他们和我们的矛盾是不可调和的对抗性的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。千笔账，万笔账，都要记在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上。而“红铁战士”中受蒙蔽的群众同我们的矛盾则是人民内部矛盾。我们紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对资产阶级反动路线和大毒草《修养》，对内蒙古和本单位一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，进行了无情的揭发、批判、斗争。
    “红铁战士”中一些同志受到反动的“驯服工具”论的毒害，错误地把党委书记看作是党的化身，在运动中不敢揭发、批判，对别人揭发的许多问题，也不相信，他们把敢于革命造反的“火车头”看作大逆不道，心眼里很反感。为了帮助这些同志提高觉悟，我们通过和他们一起控诉、批判、斗争党内走资本主义道路的当权派，使他们看清了党内走资本主义道路的当权派的反动本质，开始挣脱大毒草《修养》的精神枷锁，站到毛主席的革命路线上来。呼和浩特车站有个装卸工人，经常骂我们革命派是“牛鬼蛇神”、“反革命”。我们认为他是受蒙蔽的群众，就主动去团结他，但是他却固执地说：“我怎么错了，我究竟哪里受了蒙蔽？”后来，“火车头”战士给他摆出这样一个事实：党内走资本主义道路的当权派在“二月黑风”中，擅自冒用他和另一些铁路职工的名字，给外单位的同伙开了几十张免费乘车证，而这位工人始终被蒙在鼓里。当他知道以后，大吃一惊，对资产阶级反动路线有了一些认识。我们从这个突破口开始，继续做思想工作，帮助他与党内走资本主义道路当权派划清界限。
    通过揭发、批判、斗争党内走资本主义道路的当权派，“红铁战士”中许多同志逐步觉醒，和我们有了共同的感情和语言。老火车司机毛德发流着眼泪说：“过去我相信谣言，认为‘火车头’是‘牛鬼蛇神’。这都是党内走资本主义道路当权派搞的鬼。我受他们利用啦！我错误地站到了资产阶级反动路线的立场上，我对不起毛主席他老人家！”许多“红铁战士”狠杀回马枪，大造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，使这一小撮人陷于彻底孤立、四面楚歌的境地。
    热情耐心地做艰苦细致的思想工作
    毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”“红铁战士”绝大多数是热爱党和毛主席的，只是由于受了蒙蔽站错了队。如果不帮助他们从资产阶级反动路线的桎梏中解放出来，就不能组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，就不能孤立和打击一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    由于内蒙古“二月黑风”的猖獗，我们很多革命派战士被打成“反革命”，有些同志被斗、被抓、被关、被打。我们对资产阶级反动路线怀着深仇大恨，对保守组织的群众或多或少地存在报复情绪，对毛主席的亲切教导不是一开始就全部理解的。在军管会的领导下，我们带着问题学习毛主席的有关指示，很快地认识到：无产阶级革命派应该胸怀宽广，目光远大，要从整个阶级的利益着想，不能计较个人的恩怨。无产阶级革命派掌了权，更应该严格要求自己，坚决执行党的政策，团结绝大多数群众一起干革命。呼和浩特机务段工人、“火车头”战士毕德信同志，曾被一个“红铁战士”打过。“火车头”战士在夺权以后，毕德信担任“火车头”战斗队的勤务员，原先打他的那个人又害怕，又惭愧，走路躲着他，见了面不好意思和他说话。毕德信就主动找他谈话，帮助他“卸包袱”，说：“你打我，是受了坏人的挑动，我不把它放在心上。希望你分清是非，早日站出来革命。”这个“红铁战士”十分感动，反过来向毕德信道歉、谈心，后来积极申请参加“火车头”。
    帮人要帮心。有些“红铁战士”受蒙蔽很深，在转变过程中，会出现反复，有人头天刚声明退出保守组织，第二天又声明归队，有的曾经“三进三出”。他们摇摆不定的根本原因，在于思想问题没有真正解决。对这样的同志，我们一方面不歧视，不嘲笑；另一方面，多做艰苦细致的思想工作，帮助他们辨别大是大非，在脑海里确立毛主席革命路线的绝对统治地位。通信段有个老工人出身的技术员，长期受蒙蔽，当他有所觉悟时，社会上又刮起了反攻倒算的妖风，党内走资本主义道路的当权派趁机煽动说：当心点，“火车头”要整群众。这一来，他闹糊涂了，原先的错误认识又在心里翻腾开来。他找到“火车头”的同志质问：“你们要整人？”我们说：“这是谣言，你是受蒙蔽的群众，为啥要整你呢？”他仍然半信半疑。可是，“火车头”队员不但没整他，反而主动地接近他，耐心地向他摆情况，讲道理。这个技术员终于明白自己受了蒙蔽，他痛哭流涕地检查自己，表示这一回可认定了。他还主动找别的“红铁战士”辟谣，用自己的体会说服他们。许多“红铁战士”对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更热爱、更拥护。
    在斗争中达到真正的团结
    毛主席说：“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。真的、善的、美的东西总是在同假的、恶的、丑的东西相比较而存在，相斗争而发展的。”我们坚信受蒙蔽的群众是能够团结、教育、争取的阶级兄弟，但是，我们和他们在许多重大问题上是有分歧的。他们当中有些人不弄通思想，不改变立场，是不可能真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来的。因此，必须“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。”
    起初，不少同志对保守派群众和一般头头总憋着一肚子气，不愿和他们说话，叫他们“老保”、“铁杆”。他们不杀回马枪，就说他们“顽固”；杀了回马枪，又说是“政治投机”，“想捞稻草”。这种认识是很错误的，原因之一在于缺乏团结的愿望。以后，扭转了这种认识，对受蒙蔽群众的思想工作广泛开展起来了，但是有些“火车头”战士在做思想工作时，不坚持原则，出现了“大哥二哥差不多，你的错误大些，我的错误小些”的论调。这样，就不能真正帮助受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们接受这个教训，在一些原则问题上，坚持摆事实，讲道理，才达到既弄清思想，又团结同志的目的。
    现在，“红铁战士”这个保守组织无形中解散了。许多“红铁战士”参加了“火车头”。我们“火车头”战士正和觉悟过来的群众，共同“抓革命，促生产”，沿着毛泽东思想的轨道胜利前进。
