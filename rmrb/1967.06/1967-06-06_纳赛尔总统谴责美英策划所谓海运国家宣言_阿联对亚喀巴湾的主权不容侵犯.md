President Nasser of the United Arab Republic (UAR) denounced on the night of June 4 the plot by the U.S. and British governments to have the so-called maritime nations issue a declaration on the Gulf of Aqaba. He said that such a declaration would be considered by the UAR as an "aggression against its sovereignty and legitimate rights."

Nasser said: "There are some people who want the 'maritime nations' to issue a declaration. We do not recognize any declaration issued by the 'maritime nations.' We consider such a declaration an act of aggression against our sovereignty and legitimate rights. We consider such an act a prelude to a war of aggression."

Nasser made these remarks at a ceremony where Iraq signed the UAR-Jordan Joint Defense Agreement, becoming the third member state of the agreement.

On May 22, Nasser announced that the UAR would not allow Israeli ships to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba. The U.S. government announced on June 2 that the U.S. was "consulting with other maritime nations" to issue a declaration stating that the Gulf of Aqaba must be an "internationally navigable" waterway. The British government also claimed that Britain was in negotiations with the "maritime nations of the world" on this issue.

Nasser said at the signing ceremony: "Now, we have regained our rights over the Gulf of Aqaba, and no force in the world can take these rights away from us."

He said: "We oppose any aggression, and we will bravely resist any enemy. I am confident that the entire Arab nation will rise up against aggression and defeat it."

Nasser pointed out: "All the statements made by the United States are biased in favor of Israel. The Arabs today can understand who their enemies are and who their friends are."

Nasser refuted British Prime Minister Wilson's proposal for the return of the United Nations Emergency Force to the Sinai Peninsula, saying, "My reply to him is that he is still living in the era of two weeks ago. The United Nations Emergency Force has left our country and will never return."

Nasser exposed the double standards of the U.S., Britain, and Western powers in the United Nations, which they control, on the Palestinian issue. Nasser emphasized: "Today, we say that to achieve stability and peace in the Middle East, it is necessary to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people."

On the night of June 4, the signatories to the UAR-Jordan Joint Defense Agreement were President Nasser of the UAR and Iraqi Vice Premier Yahya.

Yahya also spoke at the ceremony, saying: "The fate of the Arab nation depends on the unity of the Arabs."

On June 4, the UAR Foreign Minister Riad issued a statement in Cairo announcing the UAR's rejection of any declaration issued by the so-called maritime nations on the Gulf of Aqaba, which was plotted by the U.S. and Britain.

The statement said: "Britain, in collusion with the United States, is continuously exerting pressure on certain 'maritime nations' to issue declarations favorable to Israel on the Gulf of Aqaba."

The statement pointed out: "If certain 'maritime nations' issue such a declaration, it would set a dangerous international precedent for the establishment of new international groups, imposing their will on other countries, claiming international legislative rights, and declaring the use of force."

The statement said: "The UAR completely rejects such a declaration and will consider it a serious interference in its internal affairs, aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial waters of the UAR. Such a declaration would be a serious threat to peace."

    纳赛尔总统谴责美英策划所谓海运国家宣言
    阿联对亚喀巴湾的主权不容侵犯
    新华社开罗四日电  阿联总统纳赛尔四日晚在这里说，所谓海运国家就亚喀巴湾发表任何宣言将被阿联认为是“对它的主权和合法权利的侵略”。
    纳赛尔说：“有那么一些人，他们要求‘海运国家’发表宣言。我们不承认‘海运国家’发表的任何宣言。我们认为这种宣言是对我们的主权和合法权利的侵略行动。我们认为这种行动是战争行动的前奏。”
    纳赛尔是在伊拉克在阿联—约旦联合防御协定上签字，成为协定的第三成员国的仪式上讲这番话的。
    五月二十二日，纳赛尔宣布，阿联不准以色列船只出入亚喀巴湾。美国政府在六月二日宣布，美国正在“同其他海运国家进行磋商”，准备发表一项宣言，宣称亚喀巴湾必须是一条得以“自由通过”的“国际航道”。英国政府也声称，英国正在同“世界海运国家”进行这样的谈判。
    纳赛尔在签字仪式上说：现在，“我们收复了对亚喀巴湾的权利，世界上任何力量都不能剥夺我们的这些权利”。
    他说：“我们反对任何侵略，我们将勇敢地抵抗任何敌人。我深信，整个阿拉伯民族将起来反对侵略，击败这种侵略。”
    纳赛尔指出：“美国的所有声明都是偏向以色列的。阿拉伯人今天能够懂得，谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。”
    纳赛尔驳斥了英国首相威尔逊关于“联合国紧急部队”返回西奈半岛的主张，他说，“我给他的答复是，他仍然生活在两周前的时代。‘联合国紧急部队’是完蛋了。它离开了我国，决不会再回来了”。
    纳赛尔揭露美、英和西方大国在他们控制的联合国里对巴勒斯坦问题采取两面政策。纳赛尔强调指出：“今天，我们说，要在中东实现稳定与和平就必须承认巴勒斯坦人民的正当权利。”
    四日晚在阿联—约旦联合防御协定上签字的是阿联总统纳赛尔和伊拉克副总理叶海亚。
    叶海亚也在仪式上讲话，他说：“阿拉伯民族的命运取决于阿拉伯人的团结。”
    新华社开罗四日电阿联外交部长里亚德四日在这里发表声明，宣布阿联拒绝接受美英策划所谓海运国家就亚喀巴湾问题发表的任何宣言。
    声明说：“英国正在和美国持续不断地对某些‘海运国家’拚命施加压力，要这些国家就亚喀巴湾问题发表对以色列有利的宣言。”
    声明指出：“某些‘海运国家’发表这种宣言将成为企图建立新的国际集团的危险的国际先例，把自己的意志强加于其他国家，宣布自己享有国际立法权并宣布使用武力。”
    声明说：“阿联完全拒绝接受这种宣言，并将认为这种宣言是对阿联内部事务的严重干涉，目的是要破坏阿联的主权和领水。这种宣言将是对和平的严重威胁。”
