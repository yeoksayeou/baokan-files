Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter on June 8 to all military and civilian personnel in North Vietnam, enthusiastically commending them for their heroic struggle against U.S. aggressors in shooting down 2,000 U.S. aircraft. He called on all military and civilian personnel to bravely advance and defeat the U.S. aggressors.

In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that no matter how many bombs the U.S. aggressors drop, they cannot stop the Vietnamese people from advancing bravely. The Vietnamese people's high patriotism and fearless heroism have been unprecedentedly manifested. The Vietnamese people's determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors is firmer than ever.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that although the U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy defeats, they are still very stubborn. He called on all military and civilian personnel to always be vigilant, smash all the cunning and vicious plots and tricks of the U.S. aggressors, and produce and fight better.

In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh finally said that the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. and for national salvation has achieved brilliant victories. The Vietnamese military and civilians are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices and will resolutely fight for the independence, freedom, and unification of their own country. At the same time, they will make active contributions to the cause of national independence and the defense of peace in the world.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, on June 9, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, warmly congratulating the military and civilian personnel of North Vietnam on their brilliant victory of shooting down 2,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The telegram said that the great victory achieved by the military and civilian personnel of North Vietnam is a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors.

The telegram pointed out that although the U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy defeats in both South and North Vietnam, they are still unwilling to admit defeat and are plotting to send more troops to South Vietnam.

The telegram from the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam expressed that no matter how many troops the U.S. imperialists send, how many bombs they drop, or what tricks and plots they play, they cannot make the Vietnamese people surrender. The heroic military and civilian personnel of North and South Vietnam will surely defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression. The military and civilian personnel of South Vietnam can withstand any test and will resolutely fight to the end until they defeat the U.S. invaders.
