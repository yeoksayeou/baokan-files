	More and more Arab countries are firmly opposing and condemning the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union to extinguish the Arab people's anti-aggression fury by concocting a Middle East "ceasefire resolution" at the United Nations Security Council.

	Sudanese Prime Minister Mahgoub announced on the 7th that the Sudanese government completely rejects the Security Council's "ceasefire resolution." Sudan will continue its fight against Israel until victory.

	According to the Syrian newspaper Al-Ba'ath on the 8th, Syria rejects the Security Council's "call for a ceasefire."

	The Algerian government announced on the 8th that Algeria will not accept the Security Council's "ceasefire resolution."

	Kuwait's Foreign Minister Sabah Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah announced on the 8th on the radio that the Kuwaiti government will not be bound by the Security Council's "ceasefire resolution."

	The Saudi Arabian government issued a statement on the 7th saying that Saudi Arabia rejects the Security Council's "ceasefire resolution."

	The Algerian Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 7th: "The United States, Britain, and Israel have launched an aggression against us and demand that we cease fire unconditionally without any guarantees. Our response to these criminal aggressors is that we will not cease fire with the aggressors. From now on, our only word is to persist in the struggle." The commentary also said: "We will thoroughly destroy all the facilities, bases, and properties of American and British imperialism on Arab land. American and British imperialism and Israel must understand that the Arab people have made up their minds today and are determined to deal with them. This counterattack will be unyielding until final victory."

	The Sudanese newspaper Al-Ra'y published a commentary on the 7th saying: "We are waging a war against Israel. We already know that imperialists are supporting it. We will defeat them all." The newspaper also called on all Arabs not to cease fire until Israel is eliminated.
