Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is an extremely important guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in our country. By seriously studying and understanding the brilliant ideas expounded in this work, and resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can distinguish between two types of contradictions of different natures, firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, correctly and effectively handle contradictions among the people, and achieve the goal of uniting the majority of the masses and cadres, and thoroughly isolating and striking at a handful of enemies.

At the North China Metal Structure Factory, there was once a serious confrontation between the two factions of the masses. After a propaganda team from the Beijing Military Region Air Force directly affiliated unit entered the factory, they, together with the broad masses of revolutionaries, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses and carried out extensive and detailed political and ideological work. They studied Chairman Mao's works well and applied them effectively, achieving remarkable results in their work of supporting the left. What is published here is their study notes.

Learn Class Analysis and Distinguish Between Two Types of Contradictions

When our propaganda team first entered the North China Metal Structure Factory, it was a time when the bourgeois reactionary line was launching a new counterattack. A handful of capitalist-roaders in the party within the factory, in order to save themselves from destruction, secretly stirred up trouble behind the scenes, deceiving and misleading a part of the masses, and instigated a counter-revolutionary seizure of power, causing serious confrontations among the masses.

Faced with this situation, we repeatedly studied the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The "Sixteen Points" points out: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution, and it is also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we realized: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our contradictions with a handful of capitalist-roaders in the party are contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and they are also the main contradictions that the Cultural Revolution must resolve; the contradictions between mass organizations sometimes appear very complex and sharp, but ultimately, they are still contradictions among the people. Only by correctly distinguishing between two types of contradictions of different natures, correctly handling contradictions among the people, and correctly treating the deceived masses, can we achieve the goal of uniting the majority and isolating a handful of enemies, direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, and complete the mission of the Cultural Revolution.

We, together with the comrades of the revolutionary organization "Red Rebels" in the factory, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people. Through study and class analysis, the revolutionary faction realized: The deceived masses are mostly from poor and lower-middle peasants. They love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The main reasons they stood on the wrong side and took the wrong path during the Cultural Revolution are as follows: Some people do not understand the Cultural Revolution and have preconceived notions; they have been key figures in past movements and think they are always correct. Some people have the idea of "class origin determinism," believing that because they come from good families and have a clean history, their words and deeds must be correct and they are naturally leftists. Some people have been deeply poisoned by "Cultivation," have a slave mentality, and think that being a "tame tool" is a good comrade, while they dislike the revolutionary spirit of the "Red Rebels." Some people have a naive class sentiment but low political awareness, do not see through the essence of class struggle, and do not know they have stood on the wrong side. Some people have mixed motives, are afraid of both front and back, follow the crowd, and dare not rebel. In general, the vast majority of them have been deceived; they are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We should adopt an attitude of "curing the sickness to save the patient" and implement the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," helping them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our class brothers, in the great waves of class struggle, have drunk a few mouthfuls of water; we should pull them up and help them swim across; we absolutely cannot ignore them, let alone push them into the water.

Chairman Mao said: "All problems of a ideological nature, all problems of disputes among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive and suppressive methods." The "Red Rebels" studied Chairman Mao's teachings, on the one hand, used the method of presenting facts and reasoning, through big-character posters, debates, and broadcasts, thoroughly exposed the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, helped the deceived masses see the situation, draw the line, clarify their thoughts, and recognize the true enemy. On the other hand, they did extensive and detailed political and ideological work among the deceived masses, carrying out extensive heart-to-heart talks. Revolutionary fighters, with deep class feelings, patiently helped the deceived masses time and time again. In their daily speech and actions, they tried to avoid provoking them and avoid exacerbating confrontational sentiments.

We also spent a lot of effort directly helping some deceived masses to correct their understanding of the "Red Rebels." Some deceived masses said that the "Red Rebels" have "impure class origins." We studied with them Chairman Mao's teachings on opposing both neglecting class origin and class origin determinism, helped them conduct a specific class analysis of the "Red Rebels," and made them realize: The "Red Rebels" are the main base of the working people. A handful of capitalist-roaders in the party have in the past slandered and defamed them, reversed black and white, and stirred up trouble between our class brothers; we must not be fooled. To judge an organization, one must look at the general direction and the main trend. If the general direction of an organization is correct and the main trend is good, it should be affirmed. The "Red Rebels" have emerged from the sharp struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line. Their struggle has always been directed at the capitalist-roaders in the party and the bourgeois reactionary line. Their general direction has always been correct. If one thinks that because there are a few people with bad class origins or a few bad people have infiltrated the revolutionary organization, one should not analyze the situation and simply deny the organization, that is completely wrong.

Some deceived masses said: The "Red Rebels" have many "troublemakers," are "unruly," "attack leaders, and want to overthrow the heavens." Through investigation and research, we found that the people they called "troublemakers" were actually those with a stronger revolutionary spirit of rebellion. When studying with the deceived masses, we helped them analyze specifically: Whether one listens or not, one must look at whom one listens to. The fundamental question is whether one listens to Chairman Mao. Under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, the "Red Rebels" dared to rebel, firmly believed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line would definitely be victorious, and firmly opposed and resisted the words of the capitalist-roaders in the party. This is not a shortcoming at all, but a revolutionary spirit that should be greatly promoted.

Regarding the shortcomings and mistakes of the "Red Rebels," they should also be analyzed specifically. When judging an organization, one cannot separate it from the general line of the two-line struggle. The nature of shortcomings and mistakes should be analyzed to see which line they are executing. The shortcomings and mistakes of the "Red Rebels" in executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, due to lack of experience and other reasons, are a problem of nine fingers and one finger. In the fierce class struggle, it is inevitable that some shortcomings and mistakes will appear. The "Red Rebels" dare to face their shortcomings and mistakes and are willing to correct them, which precisely shows that they are true proletarian revolutionaries.

Through a series of efforts, the "Red Rebels" had a correct understanding of the deceived masses, and their attitudes and actions changed fundamentally. The deceived masses' misunderstandings of the "Red Rebels" gradually disappeared, and their views of them gradually changed. Under the joint efforts of the "Red Rebels" and the broad masses of revolutionaries, the confrontational sentiments between the two factions greatly eased. The deceived masses saw the general direction clearly and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The strength of the proletarian revolutionary faction continued to grow and became absolutely superior.

专栏：

    毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇伟大著作，对当前我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是极为重要的指南。认真学习和领会这篇著作阐述的光辉思想，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，我们就能够区别两类不同性质的矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，正确地有效地处理人民内部的矛盾，就能够达到团结群众和干部大多数，彻底孤立和打击一小撮敌人的目的。
    在华北金属结构厂，两派群众组织之间曾经严重对立。北京部队空军直属队的一支毛泽东思想宣传队进厂以后，和广大革命群众一起，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的思想武装群众，作了大量深入细致的政治思想工作。他们学习毛主席著作学得活，用得好，在支左工作中取得了显著的成绩。这里发表的就是他们的学习心得。　　　——编者
    学会阶级分析　区别两类矛盾
    韩炜　张洪德
    我们宣传队刚进华北金属结构厂的时候，正是资产阶级反动路线进行新反扑的时候。厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了挽救自己灭亡的命运，在幕后煽阴风，点邪火，欺骗和蒙蔽一部分群众，策动了一起反夺权事件，挑起群众斗群众，造成了群众之间的严重对立。
    面对这种情况，我们反复学习“十六条”和毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。“十六条”中指出：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”根据毛主席的教导，我们认识到：在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是敌我矛盾，也是文化大革命要解决的主要矛盾；群众组织之间的矛盾有时看来很复杂，很尖锐，归根结底还是人民内部矛盾。只有正确区别两类不同性质的矛盾，正确处理人民内部矛盾，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，才能达到团结大多数、彻底孤立一小撮敌人的目的，才能把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，也才能完成文化大革命的使命。
    我们同厂里的革命组织“红色造反者”的同志们一起，学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导。通过学习，并且进行了阶级分析，革命派认识到：受蒙蔽的群众，绝大多数出身于贫下中农。他们是热爱毛主席，热爱共产党的。他们所以在文化大革命中站错了队，走错了路，主要有以下几种原因：有的人对文化大革命很不理解，带着框框；历次运动中他们都是骨干，自以为“一贯正确”。有的人有“唯成份论”的思想，认为自己出身好，历史清白，言行也必然正确，是“当然的左派”。有的人中《修养》的毒较深，有奴隶主义思想，认为做“驯服工具”的人，就是好同志，而对“红色造反者”的革命造反精神看不惯。有的人有朴素的阶级感情，但政治觉悟不高，看不清阶级斗争的实质，站错了队还不知道。也有的人私心杂念较重，前怕狼后怕虎，顺大流，不敢起来造反。总的来说，他们绝大多数是受了蒙蔽，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。对他们应当采取“治病救人”的态度，贯彻“团结——批评——团结”的方针，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。自己的阶级兄弟，在阶级斗争的大风浪中游泳，喝了几口水，我们应当拉他们一把，帮助他们游过去；绝不能看着不管，更不应当把他们往水里按。
    毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”“红色造反者”学习了毛主席的教导，一方面用摆事实、讲道理的方法，通过大字报、辩论会和广播，彻底揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，帮助受蒙蔽的群众看清形势，划清界限，弄清思想，认清真正的敌人。另一方面，对受蒙蔽的群众做深入细致的政治思想工作，开展广泛的谈心活动。革命派的战士怀着深厚的阶级感情，不厌其烦地对受蒙蔽的群众进行耐心的帮助，一次不行两次，两次不行三次、四次。在平时的言论和行动中，尽量避免刺激他们，避免助长对立情绪。
    我们也花了很大力量直接帮助一些受蒙蔽的群众，端正他们对“红色造反者”的认识。有些受蒙蔽的群众说“红色造反者”“成份不纯”。我们同他们一起学习了毛主席关于既反对忽视成份，又反对唯成份论的教导，帮助他们对“红色造反者”进行了具体的阶级分析，使他们认识到：“红色造反者”是劳动人民的大本营。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，过去对他们造谣诬蔑，颠倒黑白，挑拨我们阶级兄弟之间的关系，我们绝不能上当。看一个组织，要看大方向，要看主流。这个组织的大方向对头，主流是好的，就应当肯定。“红色造反者”是在同资产阶级反动路线的尖锐斗争中杀出来的。他们的斗争矛头一直指向党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线。他们的大方向始终是正确的。如果认为有少数出身不好的人，或有个别坏人混入革命组织，就不加分析地否定这个组织，那是完全错误的。
    还有些受蒙蔽的群众说：“红色造反者”“调皮捣蛋”的人多，“不听话”，“攻击领导，要想翻天”。我们通过调查研究，发现他们所说的“调皮捣蛋”的人，其实正是革命造反精神比较强的人。在同受蒙蔽的群众一起学习的时候，我们就帮助他们具体分析：听话不听话，要看听谁的话。根本的根本是要看他听不听毛主席的话。“红色造反者”在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，不怕围攻，不怕压制，不怕打成“反革命”，敢于起来造反，坚持斗争，坚信毛主席的革命路线一定会胜利。正是他们，最听毛主席的话。谁反对毛主席，谁违抗毛主席的革命路线，他们就革谁的命。对于党内走资本主义道路当权派的话，他们坚决抵制，坚决反对。这根本不是什么缺点，而是值得大大发扬的革命精神。
    对于“红色造反者”的缺点错误，也要具体分析。看一个组织，不能离开两条路线斗争这条总纲。分析缺点、错误的性质，要看他是执行的那条路线。“红色造反者”在执行毛主席的革命路线中，由于经验不足和其他原因而产生的缺点错误，这是九个指头与一个指头的问题。在激烈的阶级大搏斗中，出现一些缺点错误，是难免的。“红色造反者”对自己的缺点错误敢于正视，勇于改正，恰恰说明了他们是真正的无产阶级革命派。
    通过一系列的工作，“红色造反者”对受蒙蔽的群众有了正确的看法，态度和做法也有了根本的改变。而受蒙蔽的群众对“红色造反者”的误解慢慢消除了，对他们的看法也慢慢有了改变。在“红色造反者”和广大革命群众的共同努力下，两派群众之间的对立情绪大大缓和了。受蒙蔽的群众认清了大方向，纷纷回到了毛主席的革命路线一边来。无产阶级革命派的力量不断发展壮大，成了绝对优势。
