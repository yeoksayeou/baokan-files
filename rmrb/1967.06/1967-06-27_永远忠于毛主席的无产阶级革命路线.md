The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved resounding victories over the past year, bringing about earth-shaking changes in our country's political life and social landscape. In this great struggle, the People's Liberation Army, under Chairman Mao's great call and Vice Chairman Lin's direct leadership, has steadfastly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively supported the broad revolutionary masses, and diligently carried out tasks such as supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. This has promoted and safeguarded the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, while also tempering and testing the broad cadre and soldier masses.

Urgently addressing the concerns of the revolutionary masses and assisting them in their needs

At the critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the stage of power seizure by the proletarian revolutionary masses, Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses. This is the greatest trust, care, and encouragement for our army, and also the greatest test for our army. Before taking on the task of supporting the left, especially in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, we had a poor understanding of this unprecedented great revolutionary movement and Chairman Mao's series of theories, lines, policies, and guidelines on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, we had a firm conviction: that is, to firmly believe in the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao is victory. On some issues, due to our low level, we could not keep up with Chairman Mao's thoughts, and often could not immediately understand the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions. Our attitude was: Mao Zedong Thought is the soul guiding the entire Party, army, and nation, we must study it seriously, deeply understand it, and follow Chairman Mao closely. Whether we understand it or not, we must firmly support it and carry it out resolutely, and further understand it in practice. Only in this way can we maintain a clear mind in the complex class struggle and stand firmly on the proletarian position. Therefore, after the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and related instructions with questions in mind, corrected our understanding, raised our consciousness, and resolutely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight desperately against the revolutionary forces to maintain their power." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary mass movement carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship to prevent capitalist restoration. The focus of the struggle is still the power issue. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary masses rose up to rebel against a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, seizing their power. This rebellion is justified, and this power seizure is good! Our task in supporting the left is first and foremost to firmly support the broad leftist masses in uniting to seize power in all units that need to seize power, and to firmly support those who have already seized power to hold it well and use it well. The key to evaluating the success of supporting the left is whether we truly support the leftist masses in seizing and holding power well.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a magnificent revolutionary mass movement. We deeply feel that to do a good job in supporting the left, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the revolutionary mass movement, firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses to let them educate themselves and liberate themselves. Any method of taking over or arbitrating in matters will not get the work done. Therefore, we often guide the revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, let the masses come up with their own ideas and solutions, think independently, and take charge. Sometimes the masses' opinions and actions may have some shortcomings, as long as there is no fundamental error, we support the masses' pioneering spirit and let them do it freely. For the masses in conservative organizations who have been deceived, we also believe that once they understand the truth, they will awaken and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, we treat the visits from members of conservative organizations as "door-to-door" mass work, whether they come individually or in groups, we welcome them sincerely, explain the situation to them honestly, conduct education on the two-line struggle, and encourage them to rebel against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and against the bourgeois reactionary line.

Vice Chairman Lin points out: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. If one does not revolutionize oneself, the revolution will not be successful." To successfully complete the task of supporting the left, we must constantly carry out self-revolution, go to the masses, go to the struggle, and while transforming the objective world, also transform the subjective world. Some comrades, although they also understood that "revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class overthrowing another," felt that this rapidly approaching revolutionary storm was somewhat "chaotic," and were not accustomed to the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. However, when they came into contact with the masses, participated in the actual struggle, and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with the problems encountered in the two-line struggle, they clarified their own thoughts. Their feelings towards the revolutionary masses underwent a fundamental change, from not being accustomed to their revolutionary actions to feeling very good about them, loving what they love, hating what they hate, addressing their urgencies, and helping them with their needs, fighting together with them and achieving victory together. Several months of struggle practice have been the best tempering and testing for every comrade participating in supporting the left. We deeply feel that class struggle is the best classroom, and the revolutionary masses are the best teachers. With such a large classroom and such teachers, our thoughts will be tempered to be more red, and our work will be done better.

Supporting the revolutionary left requires a firm stance and a clear banner

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'To dare to be beheaded, to dare to pull the emperor from his horse,' when we struggle for socialism and communism, we must have this fearless spirit." In the struggle between the two classes and the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whether we dare to take the lead, stand out, take a firm stance, and clearly stand on the side of the leftist masses, fully supporting the broad leftist masses, is a matter of whether we dare to revolutionize. The People's Liberation Army is the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary masses. To support the revolutionary left, we ourselves must be firm proletarian revolutionaries.

Selflessness is the basis for fearlessness. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the basis for defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death. Over the past few months, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has given us the courage and strength to stand firm and unyielding in the support-left work, in the stormy class struggle, and to maintain the fighting posture of proletarian revolutionaries.

First, dare to take risks and support boldly.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of capitalist restoration under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, a struggle between the bourgeoisie trying to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and the proletariat trying to consolidate proletarian dictatorship. In this life-and-death class struggle, it is inevitable that there will be repeated twists and turns and various risks.

On January 22, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao united and, with the participation and leadership of revolutionary cadre Wang Xiaoyu, seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from a handful of power-holders within the former Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee who were taking the capitalist road. This is a heartening great event, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who had just been overthrown and were taking the capitalist road were not reconciled to their failure. After regaining their composure, they immediately colluded with the ghosts and snakes in society and various reactionary forces, deceived and misled some uninformed masses, and stirred up a counter-revolutionary tide throughout the city. They spread rumors and slanders, going to extremes, directing their attacks at the revolutionary cadres who stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They even attempted to strangle the proletarian dictatorship's organ of public opinion, repeatedly inciting uninformed masses to attack the newly established *Qingdao Daily*, which published the January 22 power seizure announcement, obstructing the normal publication of the newspaper, and threatening to destroy the newspaper office. In these activities, some initially rebellious mass organizations also participated, further complicating the situation. At this critical moment of intense struggle, should we hesitate and watch as the proletarian revolutionary masses face pressure? Or should we dare to take risks and actively support the proletarian revolutionary masses? Out of a high sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause, we acted decisively, stood out, and clearly expressed our firm support for the January 22 power seizure.

We stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary left, resolutely supporting the broad leftist masses, greatly encouraging the fighting spirit of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and receiving their enthusiastic welcome and support. The class enemies, however, hated us to the core. They manipulated some deceived masses to direct their attacks at our military leadership organs, attempting to shake our support for the proletarian revolutionary masses. However, the class enemies' plots did not succeed. "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing," we will always remember Chairman Mao's teaching.

Supporting the revolutionary left is a sharp and complex class struggle, inevitably facing interference, resistance, and opposition from class enemies and conservative forces. No matter where the pressure comes from or in what form, in essence, it is a reflection of class struggle. Over the past few months, we have not been swayed or shaken by various pressures, always maintaining a fighting posture to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly and unshakably supporting and protecting the proletarian revolutionary masses in Qingdao and other regions.

Reviewing the support-left work over the past few months, we feel: fearing risks means not daring to revolutionize; daring to revolutionize means not fearing risks. Proletarian revolutionary warriors loyal to Mao Zedong Thought should advance against the waves of class struggle!

Second, welcome criticism and correct mistakes immediately.

In the support-left work, can we often and humbly listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses? This is a matter of the masses' viewpoint, a fundamental attitude and stance towards the masses. Under the conditions of the masses' unlimited love and trust for our army, it is particularly necessary to educate the cadres and soldiers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks to pay serious attention to this issue. The masses daring to criticize us is a sign of their concern and love for us, which is a good thing. Our attitude towards criticisms from the masses is: "No matter who it is, as long as you point out our mistakes, we will correct them." When listening to various criticisms, we: (1) Welcome them enthusiastically, regardless of the occasion, whether in public or private, in large or small meetings; (2) Do not consider the tone, whether rough or gentle, loud or soft, severe or not, we listen calmly; (3) Do not consider the words, do not consider the degree of the remarks, whether the opinions are light or heavy, the number of problems, we must do our best to "let the speaker be without guilt, and the listener be on guard"; (4) Regardless of whether it is face-to-face, back-to-back, a letter, a note, a word or two, we listen seriously.

Humbly listening to the masses' opinions and criticisms, the leaders must take the lead and set an example. The main responsible comrades of our unit participating in the work of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "from the masses, to the masses," "concentrate," and "persist," humbly seek advice from the masses, have set a good example for all support-left personnel.

When the masses come to criticize us, we welcome them enthusiastically and listen humbly. When the masses do not come to criticize us, we go out to the masses and actively seek their opinions. A support-left unit stationed in the suburbs of Qingdao, through holding large meetings, discussion meetings, heart-to-heart talks, and other methods, has listened to the opinions of representatives from fifteen revolutionary mass organizations, totaling more than seventy people, and has visited individual households more than one hundred and forty times to seek opinions on the support-left work.

While frequently and humbly listening to the masses' criticisms, we also continuously train and conduct self-criticism. From April to now, we have organized a training session for cadres participating in the "three supports, two militaries" work every month, carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism activities, exposing thoughts, discussing problems, summarizing experiences, and learning lessons. In this way, every time we do it, our consciousness is raised one step, and our work advances one step.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad work styles and maintain good work styles." Listening to the masses' criticisms and conducting self-criticism is to discover and correct mistakes in time. Revolutionizing is bound to make mistakes. Our attitude is: admit mistakes when wrong, correct mistakes when known. Some of our units and personnel supported the conservatives, but once the masses pointed out the criticism, clarified the facts, they immediately publicly admitted their mistakes, conducted a thorough self-examination, and did a good job of follow-up work. In this way, our work is not difficult to carry out, but better; our prestige is not lowered, but higher.

Supporting the revolutionary left is fundamentally about arming the broad leftist masses with Mao Zedong Thought

Vice Chairman Lin says: "Only by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can we instill Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and transform spiritual strength into tremendous material force." The content of support-left work is extensive, but the most important and fundamental aspect is to support the left politically and ideologically, to arm the broad revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to promote the ideological revolutionization of the people. Therefore, it is necessary to run through the entire process of support-left work with the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

First, we use Chairman Mao's theory on revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship to arm the revolutionary masses, helping them to distinguish between friends and enemies, and to clearly understand that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the main target of the revolution is a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasping this direction of struggle.

After the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao seized power, a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road were not reconciled to their failure and used various means to disrupt our ranks, sabotage the unity of the revolutionary masses, and shift the direction of the struggle. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, helped the revolutionary masses to timely expose their tricks, and carried out thorough exposure and resolute struggle against them. At the same time, we enlightened and helped the deceived masses to raise their consciousness, accept lessons, and draw a clear line with a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road.

From seizing power to holding power, the position of the proletarian revolutionary masses has changed. In the revolutionary organizations, some people, to varying degrees, have various non-proletarian thoughts, such as individualism, seeking fame, small-groupism, factionalism, anarchism, etc., hindering the formation of revolutionary great alliances, hindering the establishment of proletarian authority, hindering the great criticism of the greatest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, and hindering the struggle-criticism-transformation in this region and unit. According to the development of the situation, aiming at the active thoughts of the broad masses, we organized the masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant works and important articles in *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily*, making the proletarian revolutionary masses raise their consciousness and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

To direct the spearhead of the struggle at the greatest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation in this region and unit, we in the Qingdao region held four city-wide mass rallies, repeatedly propagating the focus on the main contradiction and grasping the direction of the struggle. We also helped various revolutionary organizations to carry out rectification and study. Now, the situation in the Qingdao region is getting better and better, and a high tide of mass criticism and struggle against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road has emerged. Many units, through great criticism and struggle, have achieved revolutionary great alliances and won double victories in revolution and production.

Second, we use Chairman Mao's powerful ideological weapon, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," to help the proletarian revolutionary masses correctly treat the deceived masses and strive to unite the majority of the masses.

In the regions where we are located, after the proletarian revolutionary masses seized power, some comrades had problems in their attitudes towards the deceived masses, calling them "black conservatives," "conservative nests." Some said: "They have oppressed us for so long, today we cannot be too lenient with them." Some deceived masses approached the proletarian revolutionary masses, but some did not see their awakening and transformation, saying they were "trying to curry favor," "grasping at straws." Aiming at these problems, we and the proletarian revolutionary masses together studied Chairman Mao's teachings on strictly distinguishing and correctly handling the two types of contradictions, making them gradually realize that the masses who joined the conservative organizations were deceived by a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. We must, with strong class feelings, unite them, help them, and win them over.

To strive to unite the majority of the masses, we and the proletarian revolutionary masses together, with the deceived masses, jointly studied Chairman Mao's works, worked together, and had heart-to-heart talks. The proletarian revolutionary masses shared their revolutionary experiences with them, helping them to summarize lessons; for any small progress they made, we affirmed it; for their rising up to rebel, we welcomed them enthusiastically. At the same time, we mobilized the broad masses to fiercely struggle against a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, exposing and accusing them of manipulating conservative organizations and inciting masses to fight against masses, promoting the awakening of the conservative organization masses. The broad deceived masses withdrew from the conservative organizations one after another and joined the revolutionary organizations. They fiercely fought back, rebelling against a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line.

Third, we also use Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Wrong Ideas" and other brilliant works to help the revolutionary masses break away from selfishness and establish public spirit, transforming their worldview.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution puts forward the requirement for every revolutionary to carry out revolution on two fronts at the same time, that is, to carry out the revolution of transforming the objective world on the battlefield of transforming the objective world, and to carry out the revolution of transforming the subjective world on the battlefield of one's own mind. Only by thoroughly revolutionizing the "self" in one's mind can one thoroughly complete the historical task of transforming the objective world. Only having the courage to rebel against the power-holders taking the capitalist road, but not having the determination to seize the power of "self" in one's mind, is not a thorough proletarian revolutionary. To rebel against the "self" in one's mind, one must divide oneself into two, seeing oneself as both a revolutionary force and a revolutionary object. If one only sees oneself as a revolutionary force and does not see oneself as a revolutionary object, neglecting ideological transformation, one will not only fail to become a revolutionary force but also run the risk of becoming a revolutionary obstacle. As a responsible person of a leftist organization said: "In the sharp struggle between the two lines, one cannot hide the 'self' in one's mind like Dongguo Mr. hiding the wolf. If one does that, the consequence will inevitably be the destruction of the 'self' and the betrayal of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Guiding the revolutionary left to clarify the relationship between the following two issues is very beneficial for correctly understanding oneself and raising the self-awareness of self-revolution. One is the relationship before and after seizing power. Before seizing power, under the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, one is a fearless warrior; after seizing power, from having no power to holding power, if one's revolutionary self-awareness is poor, one may become arrogant and self-satisfied, pursuing fame, power, and personal gain, alienating oneself from the masses, and not seeking progress. Two is the relationship between the starting point and the endpoint. In the previous stage of the movement, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one advanced bravely, which is a good starting point; however, class struggle is long-term and repetitive, with a long way to go and a heavy responsibility. Only by always listening to Chairman Mao's words and serving the people wholeheartedly until death can one be said to have a beginning and an end.

"The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Wrong Ideas" point out that the core of the worldview is the question of "for whom" and the question of why one lives, which are the sharpest weapons for breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit, transforming the worldview. The problems solved by these brilliant works are both the fundamental problems of transforming the worldview and the practical problems that are constantly encountered, which need to be studied every day, studying with the "I" in mind, fighting a "liberation war" in the mind to liberate oneself from "self." One must honestly regard oneself as a revolutionary object, starting from zero, learning from the beginning, putting oneself in it, reading with sincerity, and seriously comparing. Only in this way can one achieve constant learning and constant enlightenment, truly using and applying. One cannot blindly satisfy oneself with "I am a pioneer, I am a revolutionary, I embody Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Otherwise, when reading, one will only see the words without thinking, or only have a superficial understanding, unable to grasp the spiritual essence.

"The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Wrong Ideas" are permeated with the brilliant thought of wholeheartedly serving the people from beginning to end. One must emphasize studying with full class feelings. Only by loving the people can one understand and apply it deeply; only by loving the people can one feel the weight of every word and sentence, making every word and sentence come alive. In the entire process of study, one's mind must "think of the people's interests and the suffering of the majority of the people." With these two "think of," one will be inspired with class feelings, deepen the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, and easily connect with one's own problems. Next, one must have a high degree of class hatred towards "self," hating "self" in order to break away from it, loving the public in order to establish it. To increase the hatred towards "self," we carried out the "Three Remembrances" activities in some schools, rural areas, and factories, making the masses realize that our party history is the history of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and various wrong lines; our family history is the history of blood and tears under private ownership and the history of happiness under public ownership; our personal progress history is the history of the struggle between the public and the private. Party history, family history, and personal history are all filled with the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, two classes and two roads, which boil down to the struggle between the public and the private. Through the "Three Remembrances," the class feelings of the broad masses were inspired, and the determination to wage war against "self" was strengthened.

Over the past few months, because the broad cadre and soldier masses participating in the support-left work, with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, according to the development of the struggle situation, in connection with the actual thoughts of the revolutionary masses, firmly grasped the most fundamental link of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they effectively improved the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary mass organizations, strengthened the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the broad revolutionary masses, promoted the great criticism and struggle against the greatest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the struggle-criticism-transformation in this region and unit. At the same time, we ourselves have also been educated, tempered, and improved in the waves of class struggle.

Chairman Mao recently issued another great call for the army to love the people. This is the latest instruction and highest requirement for our army's support-left work in the new revolutionary situation. We will definitely forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, exerting our utmost efforts to raise the support-left work to a new level, resolutely fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses to the end, seizing new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and consolidating proletarian dictatorship.

    永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    中国人民解放军某部负责人　李水清　陈继德
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，一年来取得了震撼世界的辉煌胜利，使我国的政治生活和社会面貌发生了天翻地覆的大变化。在这场伟大的斗争中，中国人民解放军在毛主席的伟大号召下，在林副主席的直接领导下，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，积极支持广大革命群众，努力完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项任务，促进和保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的深入开展，同时，也使广大干部战士受到了锻炼和考验。
    急革命派之所急，帮革命派之所需
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的关键时刻，毛主席向我们发出了人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，这是对我军的最大信任，最大关怀，最大鼓舞，也是对我军一次最大的考验。在接受支左任务之前，特别是在文化大革命初期，我们对这场史无前例的伟大革命运动，对毛主席提出的关于无产阶级文化大革命一系列的理论、路线、方针、政策，思想上很不理解，跟不上形势。但是，我们有一个坚定的信念，那就是坚信毛泽东思想英明伟大，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无比正确，按照毛主席指引的方向前进就是胜利。在一些问题上，由于我们的水平低，跟不上毛主席的思想，对毛主席的指示精神常常不能一下子理解透。我们的态度是：毛泽东思想是统帅全党全军全国的灵魂，我们要认真学习，深刻领会，紧跟毛主席，不管理解不理解，都坚决拥护，坚决照办，并在实践中进一步领会。只有这样，才能在错综复杂的阶级斗争中保持清醒的头脑，站稳无产阶级立场。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我们就带着问题反复认真地学习毛主席著作和有关指示，端正认识，提高思想，坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的一场防止资本主义复辟的伟大的革命的群众运动。斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派起来造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，夺了他们的权。这个反造得有理，这个权夺得好！我们支左工作，头一件事就是在一切需要夺权的单位，坚决支持左派广大群众联合起来夺权，已经夺了权的，就坚决支持他们掌好权，用好权。看支左工作好坏，首要一条就是看是不是真正支持左派夺好权，掌好权。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场轰轰烈烈的革命的群众运动。我们深刻体会到，要做好支左工作，必须坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全心全意地、满腔热情地支持革命的群众运动，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。任何包办代替或遇事仲裁的办法，都不能把工作做好。所以，我们经常注意引导革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，让群众自己出主意，想办法，独立思考，当家作主。有时群众的意见和做法，可能出现这样或那样的缺点，只要没有原则错误，就支持群众的首创精神，放手让群众去干。对保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众，同样相信他们一旦了解了事情的真相，就会觉悟，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。因此，我们对待保守组织成员的来访，认为是“送上门”来的群众工作，不管是单独的，还是集体的，都抱着欢迎的态度，诚恳地向他们讲清道理，进行两条路线斗争的教育，鼓励他们起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反。
    林副主席指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”要胜利完成支左任务，我们必须不断进行自我革命，到群众中去，到斗争中去，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。有的同志参加支左以前，虽然也懂得“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动”，但对这个来势迅猛的革命风暴，感到有些“乱”，对红卫兵革命小将的革命行动，也有些看不惯。可是，当他们接触了群众，参加了实际斗争，并带着两条路线斗争中遇到的问题活学活用毛主席著作，弄清了自己的思想之后，对革命群众的感情便发生了根本变化，对他们的革命行动由看不惯而感到好得很，爱他们所爱，恨他们所恨，急他们所急，帮他们所需，坚定地同他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起。几个月的斗争实践，对每个参加支左的同志，都是一次最好的锻炼，也是一次最好的检验。我们深刻感觉到，阶级斗争是最好的课堂，革命群众是最好的老师。有了这样的大课堂和这样的老师，思想会锻炼得更红，工作会搞得更好。
    支持革命左派，必须立场坚定，旗帜鲜明
    毛主席教导我们说：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”在无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，能不能敢字当头，挺身而出，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地站在左派群众一边，全力支持左派广大群众，对我们来说，这是敢不敢革命的问题。人民解放军是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。支持革命左派，自己必须是坚定的革命左派。
    无私才能无畏。无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。几个月来，是伟大的毛泽东思想给了我们勇气和力量，使我们在支左工作中，在惊心动魄的阶级斗争的暴风雨中，站得稳，顶得住，保持了无产阶级革命者的战斗姿态。
    第一，不怕风险，敢于支持。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政的条件下，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，是资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政和无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政的斗争。在这场你死我活的阶级斗争中，不可能不出现多次的反复和曲折，不可能不遇到这样或那样的风险。
    今年一月二十二日，青岛市的无产阶级革命派联合起来，在革命领导干部王效禹同志的参加和领导下，从前市委、市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里，夺了青岛市的党、政、财、文大权。这是振奋人心的大喜事，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。但是，一小撮刚刚被推翻的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，并不甘心于自己的失败。他们惊魂稍定，立即勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神和各种反动势力，欺骗和蒙蔽一些不明真相的群众，在全市范围内掀起了一股反夺权的逆流。他们造谣污蔑，疯狂之极，把攻击的矛头直接指向站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的革命领导干部。并且妄图扼杀无产阶级专政的舆论工具，三番两次地煽动不明真相的群众，对刊登一·二二夺权文告的新生的《青岛日报》进行围攻，阻挠报纸的正常出版，并扬言要捣毁报社。在这些活动中，也有个别最初曾经是造反的群众组织参加，这更增加了局势的复杂性。在这样激烈斗争的紧急时刻，我们是观望犹豫，坐视无产阶级革命派遭受压力呢？还是勇于担风险，积极主动地支持无产阶级革命派呢？出于对无产阶级革命事业的高度责任感，我们当机立断，挺身而出，及时地明确地表示了对一·二二夺权的坚决支持。
    我们旗帜鲜明地站在革命左派一边，坚决支持左派广大群众，大大地鼓舞了无产阶级革命派的斗志，受到了他们热烈的欢迎和拥护。阶级敌人却对我们恨之入骨。他们又操纵一些受蒙蔽的群众，把攻击矛头直接指向我们部队的领导机关，妄图动摇我们对无产阶级革命派的支持。但是，阶级敌人的阴谋诡计没有得逞。“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，我们永远记住毛主席的这一教导。
    支持革命左派，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，必然会遭到阶级敌人和保守势力的干扰、抵制和反对。这种压力不管来自那里，采取什么形式，就其实质来说，都是阶级斗争的反映。几个月来，我们没有为各种压力所屈服和动摇，始终以战斗的姿态捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定不移地支持和保护了青岛市及其他地区的无产阶级革命派。
    回顾几个月来的支左工作，我们体会到：怕风险，就不能干革命；干革命，就不能怕风险。忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命战士，应该迎着阶级斗争的风浪前进！
    第二，欢迎批评，有错必改。
    在支左工作中，能不能经常地、虚心地听取群众的意见和批评，这是一个群众观点问题，是对待群众的根本立场和态度问题。在人民群众对我军无限爱戴和信赖的情况下，经常教育执行“三支”、“两军”任务的干部战士认真注意这个问题，尤其必要。群众敢于批评我们，是关心我们，热爱我们，是好事。对待来自群众的批评，我们的态度是，“不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”在听取各种批评意见时：（一）不论什么场合，不管人多人少，会内会外，大会小会，只要提出来，就热烈欢迎；（二）不计较态度，不管气粗气细，声大声小，严厉不严厉，一律冷静听下去；（三）不计较言词，不计较讲话的分寸，不管提的意见轻重、问题多少，都要做到“言者无罪，闻者足戒”；（四）不管面对面，背靠背，一封信，一张纸条，一言一语，都要认真听取。
    虚心听取群众的意见和批评，首先是领导带头，做出样子。我部参加青岛市革命委员会工作的主要负责人，遵循毛主席的“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来”，“坚持下去”的教导，虚心向群众请教，对全体支左人员起了很好的示范作用。
    群众上门来批评，我们热情接待，虚心听取。群众不来批评，我们就走出门去，主动找群众。我们驻青岛郊区的一个支左部队，通过召开大会、座谈会、谈心会等方式，先后听取了十五个革命群众组织的七十多名代表的意见，还登门个别征求群众对支左工作的意见达一百四十多次。
    在经常地虚心听取群众批评的同时，还不断整训，开展自我批评。从四月份到现在，我们每月召集参加“三支”、“两军”工作的干部整训一次，开展群众性的批评与自我批评活动，亮思想，摆问题，总结经验，吸取教训。这样，每做一次，觉悟就提高一步，工作就前进一步。
    毛主席教导说：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”听取群众批评，开展自我批评，目的是为了及时发现和改正错误。干革命，难免犯错误。我们的态度是，有错认错，知错改错。我们有的单位有的人员支持了保守派，一经群众批评指出，弄清事实真相，就及时地公开承认错误，进行深刻检查，并做好善后工作。这样，我们的工作不是难开展了，而是更好做了；我们的威信不是降低了，而是更高了。
    支持革命左派，最根本的是用毛泽东思想武装左派广大群众
    林副主席说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”支左工作内容很多，最主要最根本的是从政治思想上支持左派，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众的头脑，促进人的思想革命化。因此，必须把活学活用毛主席著作，贯穿于支左工作的全部过程。
    第一，我们用毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的学说，武装革命群众，帮助他们分清敌我，明确在无产阶级专政条件下，革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，牢牢掌握住这个斗争的大方向。
    青岛市无产阶级革命派夺权之后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不甘心自己的失败，千方百计地扰乱我们的阵线，破坏革命群众的团结，转移斗争的大方向。我们按照毛主席的教导，帮助革命群众及时识破他们的阴谋诡计，对他们进行彻底的揭露和坚决的斗争。同时，启发和帮助受蒙蔽的群众，提高认识，接受教训，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限。
    由夺权到掌权，无产阶级革命派的地位发生了变化。在革命组织中，有些人不同程度地存在着各种非无产阶级思想，如个人主义，风头主义，小团体主义，山头主义，无政府主义等，妨碍着革命大联合的形成，妨碍着无产阶级权威的树立，妨碍着对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，妨碍着本地区、本单位的斗批改。根据形势的发展，针对广大群众的活思想，我们组织群众认真学习毛主席有关著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的重要文章，使无产阶级革命派提高了觉悟，紧紧地把握住斗争大方向。
    为了把斗争矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，和搞好本地区、本单位的斗批改，我们青岛地区先后召开了四次全市性的群众大会，反复宣传抓住主要矛盾，掌握斗争大方向。我们还帮助各革命组织开展整风学习。现在，青岛地区形势越来越好，出现了一个群众性的对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大批判、大斗争的高潮。不少单位通过大批判、大斗争，实现了革命的大联合，获得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    第二，我们用毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一强大的思想武器，帮助无产阶级革命派正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，争取团结群众的大多数。
    我们所在地区无产阶级革命派夺权以后，有的同志在对待受蒙蔽群众的态度上，存在一些问题，称他们“黑老保”，“老保窝”。有人说：“过去他们压了我们那么长的时间，今天不能太便宜了他们。”有些受蒙蔽的群众向无产阶级革命派靠拢，有的人却看不到他们的觉悟和转变，说人家是“想钻营”，“捞稻草”。针对这些问题，我们和无产阶级革命派一起，学习了毛主席关于严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的教导，使他们逐渐认识到，受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众是要革命的。他们站错了队，是受了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的害。必须以强烈的阶级感情，团结他们，帮助他们，争取他们。
    为了争取团结群众的大多数，我们和无产阶级革命派一道，与受蒙蔽的群众共同学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，一起谈心。无产阶级革命派向他们讲述自己革命造反的体会，帮助他们总结教训；对他们任何微小的进步都予以肯定；对他们起来造反，表示热情的欢迎。同时，发动广大群众狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，揭发和控诉他们操纵保守组织，挑动群众斗群众的种种罪恶事实，促进了保守组织群众的觉醒。广大受蒙蔽的群众纷纷退出保守组织，加入革命组织。他们狠杀回马枪，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线的反。
    第三，我们还用毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，帮助革命群众，破私立公，改造世界观。
    无产阶级文化大革命，给每一个革命者提出了同时在两个战场进行革命的要求，即在改造客观世界的战场上进行改造客观世界的革命，和在自己头脑里这个战场上进行改造主观世界的革命。只有在思想上彻底革了私字的命，才能彻底完成改造客观世界的历史任务。只有造走资本主义道路当权派的反的勇气，而没有夺自己头脑里私字权的决心，那就不是彻底的无产阶级革命派。要造自己头脑中私字的反，就必须对自己一分为二，既看到自己是革命的动力，又看到自己是革命的对象。如果只看到自己是革命的动力，而看不到自己是革命的对象，放松思想改造，不但不能成为革命的动力，还有变成革命阻力的危险。正象一个左派组织的负责人所说：“在尖锐的两条路线的斗争中，不能象东郭先生藏狼那样，把私字藏在脑子里。如果那样，其后果必然是被私字毁灭，背叛毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    引导革命左派弄清以下两个问题的关系，对正确认识自己，提高自我革命的自觉性，很有好处。一是夺权前和夺权后的关系。夺权前，在资产阶级反动路线的迫害下，是无畏的战士；夺权后，由无权而掌权，如革命自觉性差，就可能骄傲自满，“唯我革命”，追求名、权、利，脱离群众，不求进步。二是起点和终点的关系。在前段运动中，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，勇往直前，这是一个好的起点；但是，阶级斗争是长期的、反复的，来日方长，任重道远。只有永远听毛主席的话，完全彻底地为人民服务，一直到死，才算是有始有终。
    “老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》指出了世界观的核心是“为谁”的问题，为什么活着的问题，是破私立公，改造世界观的最锐利的武器。这些光辉著作所解决的问题，既是改造世界观的根本问题，又是经常反复地碰到的现实问题，需要天天学，对着我字学，在头脑中打一场把自己从私字中解放出来的“解放战争”。必须老老实实，确实把自己当成革命对象，从零开始，从头学起，把自己摆进去，用心去读，认真对照。这样，才能做到常学常新，真用真灵。不能盲目满足于“自己是闯将，是革命的，是体现了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的”。否则，读起来，就会只看字，不想事，或者浅尝辄止，不能领会精神实质。
    “老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》从始至终贯穿着一片红心为人民的光辉思想。必须强调带着饱满的阶级感情去学。只有爱人民，才能读得懂，领会深，用得上；只有爱人民，才能感到每字每句的分量，字字句句都活了。在学习的全过程，脑子里要“想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦”。有了这两个“想到”，就会激发起阶级感情，就会加深对毛泽东思想的理解，就易于联系自己的问题。其次，必须对私字有高度的阶级仇恨，恨私才能破私，爱公才能立公。为了增加对私字的仇恨，我们在一些学校、农村、工厂，开展了忆党史、家史、个人进步史的“三忆”活动，使群众认识到，我们的党史，就是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同各种错误路线斗争的历史；我们的家史，就是私有制下的血泪史和公有制下的幸福史；我们的个人进步史，就是公和私的斗争史。党史、家史、个人的历史，都充满着无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，归结到一点，就是公和私的斗争。通过“三忆”，激发了广大群众的阶级感情，坚定了向私字开战的决心。
    几个月来，由于参加支左工作的广大干部战士，怀着对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限忠诚，根据斗争形势的发展，联系革命群众的思想实际，狠狠抓住活学活用毛主席著作这个最根本的环节，因而有效地提高了革命群众组织的战斗力，加强了广大革命群众的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，促进了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争和本地区、本单位的斗批改。同时，我们自己也在阶级斗争的风浪中，受到了教育，经受了锻炼，得到了提高。
    毛主席最近又发出了拥军爱民的伟大号召。这是在新的革命形势下，对我军支左工作最新的指示，最高的要求。我们一定永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，竭尽全力把支左工作提高到新的水平，坚决和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，巩固无产阶级专政。
