The radiance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art has illuminated a cluster of blossoming flowers. The Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Art Festival concluded successfully. Two thousand representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers sang loudly in praise of the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, striking the strongest chord of the socialist era, and launching a fierce attack on the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 6th—The "Highly Hoist the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, 1967 Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Art Festival," which marked the workers, peasants, and soldiers truly becoming the masters of the stage, concluded successfully on June 4th in Shanghai. This art festival, which lasted for one and a half months, was a grand gathering where millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically sang the praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought. It was a grand battle where millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers took up the weapon of literature and art to launch a fierce attack on the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. It was a grand review of the burgeoning mass revolutionary literary and artistic activities over the past year of the Cultural Revolution.

At the closing ceremony, thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda squads active at the grassroots level gathered together, holding a "Mass Song and Dance Festival in Praise of the Boundless Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought," performing nine large-scale song and dance performances, as well as forty battle performances in various artistic forms.

The closing performance began with the grand song and dance "In Commemoration of the 25th Anniversary of the 'Speech.'" Squads composed of workers, peasants, and Red Guards, beating drums and dancing the yangge, surged from all directions towards the central stage of the venue, surrounding the giant model of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," singing and dancing, fully demonstrating that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the masters of creating history but also the masters of creating literature and art. The number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party slandered the propaganda teams, saying they "only know how to beat drums and dance the yangge," and nonsense about how "this way, they are harmed." Let these words go to hell! Workers, peasants, and soldiers will sing and dance loudly on the stage of literature and art, and will overturn the history that you reactionary revisionists have overturned!

At the closing performance, the workers, peasants, and soldiers once again concentrated their fiercest artillery fire, launching a fierce attack on the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party; using the weapon of literature and art to thoroughly expose and criticize the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party's anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes. The workers' singing of "The Enemy Will Not Disappear by Itself" and "The Central Issue of the Revolution is the Issue of State Power," a set of Chairman Mao's quotations, the poor and lower-middle peasants' performance of the song and dance "Raise High the Iron Hoe, Thoroughly Uproot the Backstage of Revisionism," and the soldiers' drum-singing of "Open Fire on China's Khrushchev," all deeply exposed and criticized the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party's selling of "exploitation is not a crime," "three freedoms and one contract," and other revisionist black goods, and their counter-revolutionary schemes to usurp the Party, the government, and the military. The entire venue erupted in angry battle cries time and time again: "Down with the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party!" "Pull down the number one ambitious schemer within the Party and make him stand aside!"

These workers, peasants, and soldiers from the labor production front and the troops are not only bold pioneers in seizing the revolution but also models in promoting production. At the closing performance, they brought many performances depicting themselves and their class brothers enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," fully demonstrating that they are proletarian revolutionary fighters who highly hold aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought both on and off the stage. The female commune members of Qixian Brigade, Qixian Commune, Deling County performed the small song and dance "Seize the Revolution and Promote Production," bringing the news of the first summer harvest in the Shanghai suburbs during the proletarian cultural revolution, which aroused a warm round of cheers and applause from the entire venue. The young workers of Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory performed the labor song "Seize the Revolution and Promote Production," which was warmly welcomed by the entire venue.

Chairman Mao! Ten thousand songs, a hundred thousand songs, cannot sing enough of your wisdom and greatness. At the closing ceremony, two thousand representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards danced with hundreds of large red flags and thousands of large red flowers, surrounding the golden and shining giant portrait of Chairman Mao, dancing enthusiastically to "Long Live Chairman Mao" and singing loudly "The East Is Red," "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," and "Carry the Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End," pushing the performance to its highest climax.

The "Highly Hoist the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, 1967 Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Art Festival" has, with unprecedented momentum, sung the strongest chord of the socialist era on the stage of literature and art, performing revolutionary dances full of proletarian enthusiasm and heroism. It is a cluster of brilliant flowers under the radiance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, and it has written an extremely brilliant page in the history of Shanghai's literature and art over the past eighteen years since its liberation. Let a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and various reactionary academic "authorities" tremble before the powerful battle songs and dances of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and weep in the corner under the stage occupied by workers and peasants!

    毛主席革命文艺路线光辉照耀下的一丛盛开的花朵
    上海工农兵文艺会演胜利闭幕
    二千名工农兵代表放声歌颂光焰无际的毛泽东思想，唱出社会主义时代的最强音，猛烈打击党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    据新华社上海六日电　标志着工农兵群众真正成了舞台主人的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一九六七年上海市工农兵文艺会演”，六月四日在上海胜利闭幕。这次历时一个半月的文艺会演，是千百万工农兵群众空前热烈歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的大会演，是千百万工农兵群众拿起文艺武器向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的大会战，是文化大革命一年来蓬勃开展的群众性的革命文艺活动的大检阅。
    在闭幕式上，千百个活跃在基层的毛泽东思想宣传小分队的二千名代表，汇聚一堂，举行了“放声歌唱光焰无际的毛泽东思想群众歌舞大会”，联合演出了九组大型歌舞，以及包括各种艺术形式的四十个战斗节目。
    闭幕演出以气势磅礴的大型歌舞《纪念〈讲话〉发表二十五周年》为序曲。一支支由工农兵和红卫兵小将组成的毛泽东思想宣传小分队，打响腰鼓，扭起秧歌，从四面八方涌向会场中心的舞台，簇拥着毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一光辉著作的巨幅模型，载歌载舞，充分显示了在毛主席的革命文艺路线的指引下，工农兵不仅是创造历史的主人，也是创造文学艺术的主人。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派诬蔑宣传队“就会打打腰鼓，扭扭秧歌”，胡说什么“这样下去是害了他们”。让他的这些话见鬼去吧！工农兵就是要在文艺舞台上大唱大跳，就是要把被你们这些反革命修正主义分子颠倒的历史重新再颠倒过来！
    在闭幕演出会上，参加演出的工农兵又一次集中了最猛烈的炮火，猛轰党内头号走资本主义道路当权派；用文艺这个武器狠揭、狠批党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。工人演唱的《敌人是不会自行消灭的》、《革命的中心问题是政权问题》等一组毛主席语录歌，贫下中农表演的歌舞《手中铁鎝高高举，彻底挖掉修正主义的总后台》，解放军战士说唱的鼓词《向中国的赫鲁晓夫开炮》，都极其深刻地揭露和批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派贩卖“剥削无罪”、“三自一包”等修正主义黑货和阴谋篡党篡政篡军的反革命勾当。全场一次又一次地爆发出愤怒的战斗吼声：“打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派！”“把党内头号野心家拉下马，让他靠边站！”
    这些来自劳动生产岗位和部队的工农兵群众，既是狠抓革命的闯将，也是猛促生产的模范。在闭幕演出会上，他们带来了许多描绘自己和阶级兄弟热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，“抓革命，促生产”的战斗节目，充分显示了他们在台上台下都是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命派战士。奉贤县齐贤公社齐贤大队的一群女社员演出的小歌舞《狠抓革命，猛促生产》，带来了上海郊区在无产阶级文化大革命中获得的第一个夏熟丰收的喜讯，激起全场一片热烈的欢呼声和掌声。上海电焊机厂的青年工人表演的劳动号子《抓革命，促生产》，受到全场热烈欢迎。
    毛主席啊毛主席！千支歌，万支歌，唱不完您老人家的英明伟大。在闭幕大会上，二千名工农兵和红卫兵的代表，舞起数百面大红旗，挥动数千朵大红花，簇拥着金光闪闪的毛主席巨幅画像，尽情舞蹈《万岁，毛主席》，放声歌唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底》，把演出推向了最高潮。
      “高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一九六七年上海市工农兵文艺会演”，以前所未有的强大声势，在文艺舞台上唱出了社会主义时代的最强音，表演了充满无产阶级豪情壮志的革命舞蹈，它是毛主席革命文艺路线光辉照耀下盛开的一丛绚丽的花朵，它在上海解放十八年来的文艺史上写下了极其灿烂的一页。让一小撮反革命修正主义分子和形形色色的反动学术“权威”，在广大工农兵气壮山河的战斗歌舞面前发抖吧，在工农兵占领的文艺舞台下面向隅而泣吧！
