Where is China heading? Are we to pursue socialism or capitalism? This is the paramount issue concerning China's future and the fate of the world.

On this fundamental question, there is a principled difference between the proletarian revolutionary faction led by Chairman Mao and a small clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The emergence of the reactionary films "City That Never Sleeps" and "The Lin Family Shop" is a reflection of the struggle between these two lines. These two reactionary films are cannonballs fired by the bourgeoisie at the proletariat; they glorify the capitalist system and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism; they actively advocate the reactionary path of "industrial salvation" and "capitalist salvation," opposing Chairman Mao's thorough proletarian revolutionary line of "only socialism can save China."

"City That Never Sleeps" vigorously advocates that Chinese capitalists "should run their own factories, and as long as we can produce and sell on our own, we can compete with foreigners." A "patriotic" label makes the capitalist Zhang Bokun rise from nothing to establish his own industry, competing with imperialism for over a decade and becoming a "patriotic" hero. "The Lin Family Shop" expresses boundless sympathy for the "tragedy" of the commercial capitalist Lin Boss's bankruptcy, attributing the hardships of Zhang Widow, Zhu San, Old Treasure, and the suffering of shop employees and workers to Lin Boss's bankruptcy. Isn't this saying that as long as capitalism is developed, the working people will no longer suffer? These two films go to great lengths to dress up the bourgeoisie as representatives of the "national interest"; they vigorously advocate that only by expanding bourgeois exploitation, allowing them to "control their own destiny" and develop their own industries, can capitalism save China. This is a thoroughly reactionary argument.

Their so-called "industrial salvation" is a complete bourgeois reformist idea. In the 1930s, when the proletariat had already consciously struggled for its own class interests, attempting to achieve capitalism in China through reformist methods without touching the semi-feudal, semi-colonial system is to oppose the proletarian revolution!

The Chinese people, after much hardship, finally seized power under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Practice has proven that "only socialism can save China." This experience was gained by the proletariat and the working people under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, in their struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line.

In the past, Chen Duxiu and others advocated that after the success of the bourgeois revolution, the bourgeoisie should seize power, and then strengthen the proletariat to carry out a socialist revolution. This is the reactionary theory of "second revolution." Chen Duxiu is a hundred percent right-opportunist. But after more than thirty years, there are still such people within the Party. This person is the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. For seventeen years, he has been advocating for the development of capitalism in China, dreaming day and night of restoring capitalism. He advocates the "four freedoms" and promotes the "three selfs and one package," vigorously propagating the old cliché that "capitalist exploitation is beneficial." Its essence is to make the exploitation system "eternal," to have capitalism instead of socialism.

The reactionary film "City That Never Sleeps" parrots the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, fervently advocating the capitalist path and savagely attacking proletarian dictatorship, absurdly claiming that after liberation, it was the "golden age" of capitalism, absurdly claiming that one must "dig out" the "treasures" in the hearts of the bourgeoisie and "bring the capitalists into socialism."

What "golden age," what "treasures," what "bringing into socialism"? In a word, it is to oppose socialism and pursue capitalism!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious."

The proletariat must revolutionize, rebel, struggle, and pursue socialism.

To pursue socialism, we must establish proletarian dictatorship. Lenin said: "To develop towards communism, one must go through proletarian dictatorship, and there is no other way, because no one else and no other way can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalist class." But the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road openly declares: "In our country, large-scale class struggle has passed, capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism." As for how to enter socialism? He says: "It is possible not to adopt violent struggle," "it is possible to adopt the method of persuasion," "to go peacefully." Here, class struggle is gone, and proletarian dictatorship is abolished. The reactionary film "City That Never Sleeps" comments on these black words of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. Originally, his "peaceful entry into socialism" is to use the private feelings of the capitalist's wife and children to persuade them, to use the so-called "magnanimity" and "no personal grudges" of the working class to convert them, making the capitalists abandon their reactionary class stance. This is to abolish proletarian dictatorship, to practice class capitulationism by the proletariat to the bourgeoisie, replacing the great political struggle of transforming capitalist and commercial enterprises into socialism under the strong dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the essence of the so-called "bringing capitalists into socialism" in the reactionary film "City That Never Sleeps."

The socialism and communism advocated by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road are the false socialism and communism of Khrushchev, which are true capitalism and true revisionism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the beautiful dream of restoring capitalism by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road!

Down with all exploitation systems!

    让一切剥削制度见鬼去吧！

    中国向何处去？
    干社会主义还是干资本主义？这是关系到中国前途和世界命运的头等大事。
    在这个大是大非问题上，以毛主席为首的无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间存在着原则的分歧。
    反动影片《不夜城》、《林家铺子》的出笼，就是两条道路斗争的反映。这两部反动影片，是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的炮弹；这两部反动影片，美化资本主义制度，为复辟资本主义制造舆论；这两部反动影片，积极鼓吹“实业救国”、“资本主义救国”的反动道路，和毛主席的“只有社会主义能够救中国”的彻底的无产阶级革命路线唱反调。
    《不夜城》竭力主张中国的资本家“应该办自己的厂，只要我们能够自产自销就能跟外国人竞争”，一张“爱国牌”的商标，使资本家张伯韩从无到有，发展起自己的实业，与帝国主义抗衡十几年，成了“爱国”英雄。《林家铺子》则无限同情商业资本家林老板破产的“悲剧”，并把张寡妇、朱三太、老通宝等的苦难和店员工人失业的原因说成是由于林老板的破产。这岂不是说，只要发展资本主义，劳动人民就不再受苦受难了。这两部影片费尽心机，把资产阶级打扮成“全民利益”的代表；极力鼓吹只有通过扩大资产阶级的剥削，使他们“掌握自己的命运”，发展“自己的实业”，发展资本主义，才能挽救中国的反动谬论。
    他们所说的“实业救国”，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级改良主义的东西。在无产阶级早已起来自觉地为本阶级利益而奋斗的三十年代，企图在不触动半封建半殖民地制度的情况下，用改良主义的办法在中国实现资本主义，这就是反对无产阶级革命！
    中国人民经过千辛万苦，终于在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，取得了政权。斗争实践证明：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。这个经验是无产阶级和劳动人民在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，和资产阶级反动路线的斗争中得来的。
    过去，陈独秀等人主张资产阶级革命成功后，让资产阶级掌握政权，然后壮大无产阶级，搞社会主义革命。这是反动的“二次革命”论。陈独秀是百分之百的右倾机会主义者。但是经过三十多年，党内还有这样的人。这个人，就是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。十七年来，他为在中国发展资本主义奔走呼号，日夜梦想复辟资本主义。他提倡什么“四大自由”，鼓吹什么“三自一包”，大力宣扬资本家“剥削有功”的陈词滥调。其实质就是要剥削制度“永存”，就是要资本主义，不要社会主义。
    反动影片《不夜城》象鹦鹉学舌一样，跟着党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，狂热鼓吹资本主义道路，猖狂攻击无产阶级专政，胡说什么解放后是资本主义的“黄金时代”，胡说什么要“挖”资产阶级心中的“宝贝”，要把资本家“带进社会主义”。
    什么“黄金时代”，什么“挖宝”，什么“带进社会主义”，一句话，就是反对社会主义，要干资本主义！
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    无产阶级就是要革命，要造反，要斗争，要干社会主义。
    干社会主义，就必须搞无产阶级专政。列宁说：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却公然叫嚣：“在我国，大规模的阶级斗争已经过去，资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义。”至于如何进入社会主义呢？他说：“可以不需要采取激烈的斗争”，“可以采取说服的方法”，“和平地走去”。在这里，阶级斗争不见了，无产阶级专政被取消了。反动影片《不夜城》给党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的这些黑话作了注释。原来他的“和平进入社会主义”，就是叫资本家的老婆儿女用私情来规劝之，就是通过工人阶级的所谓“宽宏大量”、“不记私仇”来感化之，使资本家们放弃反动的阶级立场。这也就是要取消无产阶级专政，要无产阶级对资产阶级实行阶级投降主义，用以代替在强大的无产阶级专政条件下，所进行的资本主义工商业社会主义改造的伟大政治斗争。这就是反动影片《不夜城》里所谓把资本家“带进社会主义”的实质。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的社会主义、共产主义，就是赫鲁晓夫的假社会主义、假共产主义，就是真资本主义、真修正主义。
    无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦！
    让一切剥削制度统统见鬼去吧！
