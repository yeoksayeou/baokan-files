Throughout the development of the situation in the Middle East, the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union have all colluded, plotting and encouraging Israel's aggressive actions to suppress the anti-aggression struggles of the Arab people. In this grand conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist clique has employed thoroughly two-faced, counter-revolutionary tactics.

After the U.S. imperialists directed Israel to threaten Syria with aggression, the peoples of various Arab countries mobilized in response, actively preparing to resist the aggression. The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to deceive the Arab people, issued a statement on May 23, hypocritically declaring that if Israel launched an aggression, "it would face resolute anti-aggression actions from the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries." However, this statement did not dare to touch a single hair of the U.S. imperialists, the backers of Israel, and intentionally concealed the U.S. imperialists' aggression crimes, covering up the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Middle East issue. At the same time, messages from the U.S. continuously revealed that the Americans felt in their "private talks with Moscow" that the Kremlin did not want to go too far as to get involved in direct military actions.

The Soviet revisionist clique's treacherous behavior greatly encouraged the U.S. imperialists and their aggressive tool, Israel, in their aggressive ambitions. The U.S. and British imperialists, on the one hand, vigorously supported Israel in accelerating its aggressive deployments, and on the other hand, gathered fleets in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, evacuated expatriates from Arab countries, and backed the Israeli aggressors. After U.S. newspapers repeatedly exposed that Israel was about to launch a sudden attack on the UAR, and even after Israel formed a military cabinet and openly issued war cries to "defeat the Arab people," the Soviet revisionist leadership still loudly proclaimed the "possibility of resolving the Middle East crisis."

On June 5, Israel brazenly launched an aggressive war against the Arab countries. The Soviet revisionist clique then completely tore off its mask of fake support for the Arab people, openly revealing its true face of betrayal. In its second statement, the Soviet revisionist clique still did not condemn the U.S. imperialists by a single word, avoiding the issue of aiding the Arab people in their anti-aggression struggles. Moreover, the Soviet propaganda machine even published Israel's battle reports while suppressing news from Arab countries condemning the participation of U.S. and British air forces in the aggression.

At the same time, the Soviet revisionist leadership intensified its counter-revolutionary collusion with U.S. and British imperialism, attempting to suppress the self-defense counterattacks of the Arab countries through the United Nations and the intervention of big powers. At the Security Council meeting on June 5, the Soviet revisionist clique initially hypocritically expressed disagreement with an immediate ceasefire. However, after Washington and Moscow conducted "hotline" talks, the Soviet revisionist clique's representative, Fedlin, changed his attitude during talks with the U.S. representative Goldberg. According to the United Press International's Moscow dispatch, the Soviet Politburo discussed the Middle East situation in the morning of June 6. In the afternoon, Fedlin and Goldberg met again and immediately agreed to the "actions the U.S. wanted the Security Council to take."

Despite the Security Council's unreasonable resolution being rejected by many Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique still ignored the will of the Arab countries and further served the U.S. imperialists. On June 7, the Soviet revisionist representative again proposed a motion at the Security Council, demanding that the "governments of the relevant countries" cease fire and stop all military actions within a specified time. Since this motion was aimed at suppressing the anti-aggression actions of the Arab countries and allowing Israel to occupy large tracts of Arab land, it naturally received the enthusiastic support of U.S. and British imperialism and Israel.

Under the encouragement of the Soviet revisionist clique's policy of capitulation and betrayal, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs became even more audacious, demanding higher prices. Not only did they blatantly demand that the UAR lift the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, but they also proposed an even more arrogant so-called "comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem." U.S. newspapers boasted that they would allow the so-called "United Nations Emergency Force," which had just been expelled by the UAR, to return, to "restore some international observation and supervision" over the Arab countries, and to redraw a so-called "more realistic border," allowing Israel to obtain much more land than it currently has.

It must be seen that the Soviet revisionist leadership's activities of capitulation and betrayal are not only aimed at colluding with U.S. imperialism to extinguish the anti-U.S. flames in the Arab region but also to use the interests of the Arab people to trade with U.S. imperialism, further promoting their counter-revolutionary line of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world."

An article from the British "Times" on June 8 reported from Washington that many Americans believed that "a package deal to solve both the Middle East problem and the Vietnam problem is the only solution." There were also reports that some U.S. congressmen believed that "if cooperation with Russia in the Middle East is achieved, it would be possible to cooperate in ending the Vietnam War." The trend of behind-the-scenes deals between the Soviet Union and the U.S. on the Middle East and Vietnam issues cannot but draw close attention.

This Middle East incident has thoroughly exposed the U.S. and British imperialists as the mortal enemies of the Arab people and has also thoroughly exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionist clique, this false friend. The one billion Arab people will surely learn lessons from this incident, rely on their own strength, and with the support of the revolutionary people of the whole world, continue to fight to the end against the U.S. imperialists and their aggressive tool, Israel.

### 苏修同美英串通一气镇压阿拉伯人民

    苏修同美英串通一气镇压阿拉伯人民 
    在中东局势的整个发展过程中，美英苏都是串通一气，策划和鼓励以色列的侵略行动，镇压阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争。在这个大阴谋中，苏修集团玩弄的完全是两面三刀的反革命手法。
    当美帝国主义指使以色列对叙利亚进行侵略威胁以后，阿拉伯各国人民纷纷动员起来，积极准备抵抗侵略。苏修集团为了欺骗阿拉伯人民，曾在五月二十三日发表声明，假惺惺地说什么如果以色列发动侵略，“会受到苏联和一切爱好和平的国家的坚决的反侵略行动”。但是，这个声明根本不敢触动以色列的后台老板美帝国主义的一根毫毛，有意掩盖美帝国主义的侵略罪责，掩盖苏美在中东问题上的互相勾结。同时，从美国方面就不断传出消息说，美国在同莫斯科的“私下会谈中感到，克里姆林宫并不想走得很远，以至于卷入直接的军事行动”。
    苏修集团的这种叛卖行为，大大地鼓励了美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的侵略野心。美英帝国主义一方面竭力支持以色列加紧侵略部署，一方面又在地中海和红海集结舰队，从阿拉伯国家撤退侨民，为以色列侵略者撑腰。当美国报纸一再透露以色列即将对阿联发动突然袭击，甚至在以色列组成军事内阁，公然发出要“打败阿拉伯人”的战争叫嚣以后，苏修领导集团还在大肆宣扬“中东危机得到解决的可能性”。
    六月五日，以色列对阿拉伯国家悍然发动侵略战争，苏修集团就完全撕去了它对阿拉伯人民假支持的面纱，而公开暴露出它的真出卖的面目。苏修集团在它发表的第二个声明里，仍然只字也不谴责美帝国主义，避而不谈援助阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的问题。不仅如此，苏联宣传机器竟然还发表以色列的战报，而扣压阿拉伯国家谴责美英空军参预侵略的消息。
    与此同时，苏修领导集团加紧了同美英帝国主义的反革命勾结，力图通过联合国和大国干涉的方式来压制阿拉伯国家的自卫反击行动。六月五日的安理会上，苏修集团一度假惺惺地表示不同意立即停火。但是，经过华盛顿和莫斯科通过“热线”密谈以后，苏修集团的代表费德林同美国代表戈德堡会谈时就改变了态度。据合众国际社的莫斯科电讯透露，六日上午苏共中央政治局开会讨论了中东局势。到了下午，费德林同戈德堡再次会谈，立即同意了“美国要安理会采取的行动”。
    尽管安理会的无理决议，遭到了许多阿拉伯国家的拒绝，但是，苏修集团仍然无视阿拉伯国家的意志，进一步为美帝国主义效劳。六月七日，苏修代表又在安理会提出一个提案，要求交战双方“有关国家政府”在规定时间内“停火和停止一切军事行动”。由于这个提案是要压制阿拉伯国家的反侵略行动，使以色列侵占阿拉伯国家的大片土地，当然得到了美英帝国主义和以色列的双手赞成。
    在苏修集团的投降叛卖政策鼓励下，美帝国主义及其走狗更加得寸进尺，抬高要价，不但明目张胆地要求阿联撤销对亚喀巴湾的封锁，而且提出了更加狂妄的所谓“全面解决中东问题”的方案。美国报纸扬言，要让刚刚被阿联驱逐出来的所谓“联合国紧急部队”重新回去，对阿拉伯国家“恢复某种国际观察和监督”，并且要重新划定一条所谓“比较现实的边界”，让以色列得到比它“现在多得多”的领土。
    必须看到，苏修领导集团的这种投降叛卖活动，不仅是为了勾结美帝国主义一起扑灭阿拉伯地区的反美烈火，而且是要拿阿拉伯人民的利益来同美帝国主义做交易，更进一步推行它的“苏美合作主宰世界”的反革命路线。
    英国《泰晤士报》八日从华盛顿发出的一篇报道说，美国许多人认为，“既解决中东问题又解决越南问题的一揽子交易是唯一的解决办法”。还有消息说，美国的一些国会议员认为，“如果在中东同俄国合作，就有可能导致在结束越南战争方面的合作。”苏美之间在中东和越南问题上进行幕后交易的这种动向，不能不引起人们的密切注意。
    这次中东事件，彻底暴露了美英帝国主义是阿拉伯人民的死敌，也彻底暴露了苏修集团这个假朋友的真面目。一亿阿拉伯人民一定会从这次事件中吸取经验教训，依靠自己的力量，在全世界革命人民的支持下，再接再厉，把反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争进行到底。
