Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: In the great situation where the proletarian cultural revolution in our country is triumphantly advancing and winning victory after victory, at the crucial moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses launch a general offensive against the party's biggest capitalist-roader in power, the hundreds of revolutionary mass organizations of the central directly affiliated arts system, in response to the battle call of our great leader Chairman Mao, under the intimate care and direct guidance of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, through revolutionary criticism, have united under the great banner of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

The more than 14,000 arts warriors from the central directly affiliated arts troupes, art academies, film, book, museum, and cultural relics systems, today, filled with revolutionary spirit, full of vigor, and with high morale, gathered at the Beijing Workers' Stadium, holding their first battle review after great unity—jointly criticizing and struggling against the party's biggest capitalist-roader in power.

Comrade Chen Boda, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, attended today's grand meeting of the proletarian revolutionary masses' great unity and great criticism, and on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and Comrade Jiang Qing, extended warm congratulations to the meeting. He said: "The revolution in the arts is the beginning of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country. Your meeting today is a model of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses. You should continue to be a model of great unity and great criticism." Comrade Chen Boda wished the revolutionary arts workers great success in their great unity, great criticism, and all other work, and issued a call to all arts warriors: "Continuously arm your minds with Mao Zedong Thought, educate yourselves, liberate yourselves, and manage yourselves."

Members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Wu Han and Comrade Ji Pengfei, as well as members of the arts group of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Jin Jingmai, Li Yingru, Shu Shijun, Lu Gongda, and Liu Jucheng, also attended today's meeting.

The great unity of the revolutionary mass organizations of the central directly affiliated arts system marks a new level and a new stage in the great criticism and great struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital's arts circle against the party's capitalist-roaders in power. The arts warriors in the capital, at the decisive moment of the proletarian cultural revolution, have united, grasped the main contradiction, and firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! This revolutionary feat will greatly promote the great unity and great criticism of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the entire arts circle and even the whole country, pushing the current great criticism movement to develop more deeply.

In the magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, various revolutionary mass organizations have emerged in the units of the central directly affiliated arts system. They have made great contributions in the struggle against the party's capitalist-roaders in power. At the same time, due to some differences in views and the influence of anarchism, parochialism, cliquism, and individualism in the revolutionary mass organizations, there have been many contradictions and disputes among them. This situation has caused the cultural revolutionary army of the arts circle to be scattered and out of step, seriously affecting the direction of the struggle for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses to seize power from the party's capitalist-roaders in power. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the intimate care and direct guidance of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the broad arts workers, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have seriously summed up the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement, determined to change this situation. They said: "No matter how big the contradictions among us revolutionary masses are, they are not as big as the contradictions between us and the party's biggest capitalist-roaders in power. A thousand reasons, ten thousand reasons, small reasons must serve the big reason! A thousand important things, ten thousand important things, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle is the most important!" "In the face of the great enemy, we must distinguish between friends and enemies, unite all revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary arts workers, and direct the spearhead of the struggle fiercely and accurately at the party's biggest capitalist-roaders in power!"

In preparation for the first struggle and criticism meeting after great unity, many units have established joint command headquarters and preparatory groups. Members of revolutionary mass organizations that were previously opposed to each other now sit together calmly to jointly study battle plans and speech outlines. Many units' revolutionary mass organizations have also jointly held oath-taking meetings or jointly conducted street propaganda performances to prepare for this struggle and criticism. Everyone is determined to clearly, explicitly, and unambiguously direct the spearhead of the struggle at the party's biggest capitalist-roaders in power in the great unity and great criticism, and further promote revolutionary great unity through great criticism.

Today, the arts warriors of the central directly affiliated arts system, who have united in revolutionary criticism, are full of vigor and high morale. Early in the morning, they poured into the Beijing Workers' Stadium. At the center of the meeting's presidium, a large color portrait of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao is prominently displayed. The entire hall is filled with red flags, Mao's quotations, and large-character slogans expressing the firm revolutionary resolve of the revolutionary arts workers to be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. The hall is filled with the revolutionary fighting atmosphere of great unity and great criticism. The arts warriors are enthusiastic, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting: "The proletarian revolutionary masses unite! Firmly grasp the direction of the struggle! Overthrow the party's biggest capitalist-roaders in power! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Before the meeting began, the entire audience read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution.... Our revolution must have the assurance of not going astray and of definitely succeeding, and it is impossible not to pay attention to uniting our true friends to attack our true enemies."

Comrade Jin Jingmai, member of the arts group of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, spoke at the meeting, highly praising the great significance of the great unity of the revolutionary mass organizations of the central directly affiliated arts system. He said, we proletarian revolutionary masses are fighting for the proletariat to seize power. Because our goals are the same, we have every reason to unite, every necessity to unite, and every possibility to unite. We must unswervingly carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, concentrate our firepower, and launch a comprehensive and fierce general offensive against the party's capitalist-roaders in power. In the great struggle and great criticism, we will promote, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the arts circle's various fronts and units. This is our primary battle task at present, and this is the direction of the current struggle. The proletarian revolutionary masses must firmly grasp this direction.

Jin Jingmai said, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Organize tens of thousands and millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to launch an offensive against the counter-revolution." Our struggle against the party's biggest capitalist-roaders in power is a massive "people's war." Only by mobilizing the broadest revolutionary masses can we wage this "people's war" and overthrow, smash, and expose the party's capitalist-roaders in power. He pointed out that the arduous tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various systems and units still await our completion, and the difficulties still await us to overcome one by one. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, unite further in the great struggle and great criticism, do well in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

Representatives of the four revolutionary mass organizations in the capital's arts circle—Revolutionary Rebel Smash the Ministry of Culture Joint Committee, Capital Revolutionary Arts Rebel Headquarters, Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Arts Commune, and Capital Arts Circle Red Rebel Headquarters—made a joint speech at the meeting, enthusiastically hailing the great unity of the revolutionary mass organizations of the central directly affiliated arts system. They firmly declared: We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unite more closely, exert all our efforts, and together fight the enemy, overthrow and expose the party's biggest capitalist-roaders in power, and thoroughly complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation!

    遵循伟大领袖毛主席教导　紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    中央直属文艺系统联合斗批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    陈伯达同志出席无产阶级革命派大联合大批判大会，并代表中央文革小组热烈祝贺
    数百个革命群众组织的一万四千多名文艺战士满怀革命豪情地表示：更加紧密地联合起来，全力以赴，共同对敌，彻底完成斗批改的伟大历史任务
    新华社十日讯　在我国无产阶级文化大革命高奏凯歌、节节胜利的大好形势下，在无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的关键时刻，中央直属文艺系统的数百个革命群众组织响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号召，在中央文革小组的亲切关怀和直接指导下，通过革命的大批判，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大旗帜下，联合起来了！
    中央直属文艺团体、艺术院校、电影、图书、博物、文物系统各革命群众组织的一万四千多名文艺战士，今天满怀革命豪情，意气风发，斗志昂扬地齐集在北京工人体育馆，举行了他们大联合后的第一次战斗的大检阅——联合斗批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志出席了今天的无产阶级革命派大联合、大批判的盛会，代表中央文革小组和江青同志对大会表示热烈祝贺。他说：“文艺界的革命是我国无产阶级文化大革命的开端。你们今天的大会，就是无产阶级革命派大联合的模范。你们应该继续成为大联合大批判的模范。”陈伯达同志祝革命文艺工作者大联合、大批判及各项工作取得胜利，并向全体文艺战士发出号召：“不断用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己管理自己。”
    中央文革小组成员戚本禹同志，以及中央文革小组文艺组成员金敬迈、李英儒、舒世俊、陆公达、刘巨成，也出席了今天的大会。
    中央直属文艺系统各革命群众组织的大联合，标志着首都文艺界无产阶级革命派对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判大斗争，提高到了一个崭新的水平，发展到了一个崭新的阶段。首都文艺战士在无产阶级文化大革命决战时刻联合起来，抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这一革命壮举，必将极大地促进整个文艺界以至于全国的无产阶级革命派的大联合、大批判，推动当前的大批判运动更深入的发展。
    在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命中，中央直属文艺系统各单位产生了许多革命群众组织。它们在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中作出了很大贡献，同时，由于观点上的一些分歧和无政府主义、本位主义、小团体主义和个人主义思潮在革命群众组织中的影响，相互之间也存在着不少矛盾和争论。这种情况，使得文艺界的文化革命大军兵力分散，步调不一，严重地影响了无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权这个斗争的大方向。广大文艺工作者在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在中央文革小组的亲切关怀和直接指导下，通过活学活用毛主席著作，认真总结了前一段运动的经验教训，决心改变这一状况。他们说：“我们革命群众之间的矛盾再大，也大不过我们和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。千条道理，万条道理，小道理要服从大道理！千重要，万重要，牢牢掌握斗争大方向最重要！”“大敌当前，我们一定要分清敌我，把所有革命群众组织和革命文艺工作者都联合起来，把斗争的矛头狠狠地、准准地对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派！”
    为了开好大联合后的第一次斗批大会，连日来许多单位都成立了联合作战指挥部和筹备小组，一些过去互相对立的革命群众组织成员，现在心平气和地坐在一起共同研究作战方案，共同研究发言提纲。不少单位的革命群众组织为了准备这次斗批，还联合召开誓师大会或联合进行街头宣传演出。大家决心要在大联合大批判中，尖锐地、明确地、毫不含糊地把斗争矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并且通过大批判进一步促进革命的大联合。
    今天，在革命的大批判中联合起来的中央直属文艺系统的文艺战士们，意气风发，斗志昂扬，一清早就源源不断地涌向北京工人体育馆。大会主席台正中，高挂着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅彩色画像。整个大厅，红旗林立，布满了鲜红的毛主席语录和表达革命文艺工作者无限忠于毛泽东思想、誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强的革命决心的大字标语。大厅里到处洋溢着大联合、大批判的革命战斗气氛。文艺战士们，群情激昂，一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“无产阶级革命派联合起来！”“牢牢掌握斗争大方向！”“打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派！”“我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    大会开始之前，全场齐声朗读毛主席的语录：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。”“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。……我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”
    中央文革小组文艺组成员金敬迈同志在会上讲话，高度评价了中央直属文艺系统各革命群众组织大联合的重大意义。他说，我们无产阶级革命派，是为无产阶级夺权。因为我们的目标一致，所以我们完全有理由联合起来，完全有必要联合起来，完全有可能联合起来。我们一定要坚定不移地执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，集中火力，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开全面的猛烈的总进攻，在大斗争大批判中促进、巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，推动文艺界各条战线、各个单位的斗、批、改，这就是当前我们首要的战斗任务，也就是当前斗争的大方向。无产阶级革命派必须牢牢地掌握住这个大方向。
    金敬迈说，我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”我们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是一场规模巨大的“人民战争”，只有动员最广大的革命群众，才能进行这场“人民战争”，才能把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。他指出，各系统各单位的斗、批、改的艰巨任务，还等待着我们去完成，困难还有待我们去一个个地战胜，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，在大斗争大批判中进一步联合起来，把本单位的斗、批、改搞好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    首都文艺界四大革命群众组织——革命造反派砸烂文化部联合委员会、首都革命文艺造反总部、北京工农兵文艺公社、首都文艺界红色造反总部的代表，在大会上作了联合发言，热烈欢呼中央直属文艺系统各革命群众组织的大联合。他们坚决表示：一定要遵循毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更紧密地联合起来，全力以赴，共同对敌，斗倒批臭党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底完成斗批改的伟大历史任务！
