In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the focal point of the struggle between the two lines is on the question of how to deal with the masses. Whether to believe in the masses and rely on them is not only a matter of attitude but also a matter of stance. We, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, are propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and executors of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, we must first firmly believe that the broad masses want revolution.

When we first entered the factory, we saw that there were many people in the conservative organizations who had been deceived, and a few people, due to being deeply poisoned, had slower awakening and could not quickly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We became somewhat impatient, feeling that the situation in this factory was special, the masses were backward, and it would not be easy to achieve the goal of uniting the majority. At this time, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should believe in the masses, and we should believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." We realized that believing in the masses should include those who have been deceived and those who have not yet awakened. We should believe that the vast majority of them love Chairman Mao and want revolution; believe that they can awaken and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In general, it is relatively easy to believe in the masses; to believe in the masses steadfastly even when they have not awakened is to truly act according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

There is an old worker in this factory who comes from a very poor background. Due to being deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line, he did not initially recognize the direction of the struggle and joined the conservative organization. At first, I did not understand why he joined the conservative organization and always blamed him for being "backward" and "stubborn." Later, following Chairman Mao's teachings, I had several heart-to-heart talks with him and discovered that this old worker loves the new society very much and has deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. He said, "If I don't love Chairman Mao, who will? If I don't want revolution, who will?" He joined the conservative organization because he mistakenly thought that defending the Party committee of this unit and defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao, were the same. At the same time, due to being deeply poisoned by "Cultivation of the Self," he did not understand the rebellious spirit of the revolutionary youths. In response to this situation, we repeatedly explained to him: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, a life-and-death class struggle. If we allow the schemes of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party to succeed, they will carry out a capitalist restoration in China, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and we will suffer twice the hardship and twice the misery. After several conversations, this old worker gradually realized his mistake and decided to withdraw from the conservative organization and join the revolutionary organization.

In this factory, there are many old workers like him. Due to the active efforts of the revolutionary masses, in less than two months, these comrades have successively withdrawn from the conservative organization and joined the revolutionary organization. This vividly proves the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought and the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    坚信大多数群众是要革命的
    孔宪阶
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，两条路线斗争的焦点是在如何对待群众的问题上。相信不相信群众，依靠不依靠群众，不仅是态度问题，而且是立场问题。我们毛泽东思想宣传队是宣传毛泽东思想的，是贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线的，首先就应该坚信广大群众是要革命的。
    刚进厂时，看到保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众人数较多，有少数人由于中毒较深，觉悟较慢，不能很快地站到毛主席的革命路线上来，我们就产生了一些急躁情绪，觉得这个厂的情况特殊，群众落后，团结大多数的目的不大容易实现。这时，我们又学习了毛主席的教导：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”大家认识到：相信群众，就应当包括那些受了蒙蔽的群众，那些一时还没有觉悟的群众。要相信他们中间绝大多数是热爱毛主席的，是要革命的；相信他们能够觉悟起来，回到毛主席的革命路线一边。在一般的情况下，相信群众还是比较容易做到的；在群众没有觉悟的时候，仍然毫不动摇地相信群众，这才是真正按照毛主席的革命路线办事。
    这个厂里有个老工人，出身很苦，由于受资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，一时没认清斗争的大方向，参加了保守组织。开始，我对他为什么参加保守组织不大理解，心里总埋怨他“落后”、“顽固”。后来，遵照毛主席的教导，多次找他谈心，发现这个老工人，对新社会非常热爱，对党、对毛主席有深厚的阶级感情。他说：“我不热爱毛主席谁热爱，我不革命谁革命。”他所以参加了保守组织，是错误地认为：保卫本单位的党委和保卫党中央，保卫毛主席是一致的。同时，由于受《修养》的毒害较深，他对革命小将的造反精神很不理解。针对这种情况，我们向他反复说明：无产阶级文化大革命是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是一场你死我活的阶级搏斗。如果让党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋得逞，他们就会在中国搞资本主义复辟，使无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，我们就会重吃二遍苦，重受二茬罪。经过几次谈话，这个老工人逐渐认识了自己的错误，决心退出保守组织，参加革命组织。
    在这个厂里，象他这样的老工人是很多的。由于革命派的积极努力，不到两个月的时间，这些同志就纷纷退出保守组织，参加了革命组织。这生动地证明了毛泽东思想的无比威力，证明了毛主席革命路线的无比威力。
