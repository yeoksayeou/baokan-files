The Soviet revisionist leadership's chief, Kosygin, under the pretext of attending the United Nations General Assembly emergency session, personally went to the United States to conspire with the American imperialist leaders to plot further betrayals of the revolutionary interests of the peoples of the world. This marks a new phase in the more intimate and more open collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in their global counter-revolutionary strategy. It is a new development in the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of complete surrender and betrayal, adapted to the needs of U.S. imperialism as its counter-revolutionary global strategy accelerates toward bankruptcy.

"The package deal" is a counter-revolutionary conspiracy

Kosygin's visit to the United States is the first time since Khrushchev's fall that the new Soviet revisionist leaders have directly conspired with the American imperialist leaders on U.S. soil to plot global collusion. From the large amount of information that has already been revealed, it is clear that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are engaged in collusion aimed at resolving a series of issues, including Vietnam and the Middle East, in what they call a "package deal." This means they are using the unprecedentedly close "cooperation" between them in the Middle East to further advance their counter-revolutionary conspiracy to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Vietnam, the Arabs, and the world.

On the 19th, Johnson in Washington and Kosygin in New York delivered speeches one after the other, with one hoping for "joint action" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in all areas and the other advocating that the U.S. and the Soviet Union "find common ground." In reality, they have already begun "direct dialogue" to expand "joint action." At the same time, Gromyko and Rusk held frequent secret talks, and Soviet and American officials actively prepared for the direct talks between Kosygin and Johnson. These developments indicate that the new Soviet revisionist leaders are engaged in a global sellout far exceeding that of Khrushchev.

The new development in the global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not accidental. Since the new Soviet revisionist leadership came to power, they have gone further than their predecessor Khrushchev in colluding with U.S. imperialism in counter-revolutionary activities. Especially since Gromyko's secret talks with U.S. imperialist leaders Johnson and Rusk in September and October of last year, the full-scale collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union has developed rapidly and significantly. In fact, they have formed an anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary alliance.

Conspiring to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people

On the Vietnam issue, soon after the new Soviet revisionist leadership came to power, they changed Khrushchev's "withdrawal" policy to an "intervention" policy, attempting to use the tactic of fake support and real betrayal to bring the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation under the control of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world." This approach completely meets the needs of the U.S. imperialists, who have been beaten to a standstill and are at their wits' end by the Vietnamese people. After Gromyko's conspiracy with Johnson and Rusk last year, the Soviet revisionists have become increasingly frequent and blatant in their help to the U.S. in implementing the conspiracy of "using war to force peace" and "bombing to lure peace." In February of this year, Kosygin visited Britain and secretly conspired with the U.S. political agent, British Prime Minister Wilson, to play the "bombing to lure peace" trick, bringing the Soviet revisionists' betrayal activities to an unprecedentedly blatant level. At the same time, the Soviet revisionists actively cooperated with the U.S. to expand the war in Vietnam, on the one hand, by promoting "detente" in Europe, allowing the United States to concentrate its military forces in the East and continuously increase the number of troops invading Vietnam; on the other hand, by frenziedly intensifying anti-China activities, attempting to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples's fighting unity. All of this fully exposes the true face of the Soviet revisionist traitors as the number one henchmen and special forces of U.S. imperialism.

Because the Vietnamese people, with the support of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, insist on carrying out their sacred struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end and have achieved brilliant victories, the great conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Vietnam has repeatedly suffered shameful failures. However, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist partners are never willing to accept their failures. They are always looking for ways to collude more closely together to jointly extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle. Now, in the eyes of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, the "cooperation" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the Middle East has created a "better atmosphere" for "resolving the Vietnam conflict." In this situation, Kosygin personally went to find the U.S. imperialist leaders to jointly plot new conspiracies to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, fully exposing the Soviet revisionists' eagerness to engage in betrayal activities.

"Non-proliferation" deal accelerates

At the same time, in the manufacture of the nuclear deception that sells out the interests of the peoples of the world, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have long been engaged in a more significant and dirty deal than the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty between the U.S., the U.K., and the Soviet Union—the so-called "non-proliferation" treaty. Since last September and October, especially in the context of China's continuous successful nuclear tests, the pace of this deal has greatly accelerated. Since last year, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have used the United Nations General Assembly as a political trading post to repeatedly advocate for the acceleration of the signing of this treaty. At the beginning of this year, they again used the signing of the so-called "Peaceful Use of Outer Space Treaty" as a step to promote the "non-proliferation" big deal. Since February of this year, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have further used the Geneva "disarmament" conference to actively peddle this big deception.

In the process of haggling over this deal, the Soviet revisionists have repeatedly made significant concessions and compromises to the U.S. Therefore, Rusk recently publicly stated that significant progress has been made in the signing of this treaty, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union have resolved the main issues in the treaty. Now, in Johnson's speech on the 19th, he explicitly stated that he hopes to reach an agreement on this treaty "immediately." Kosygin, in his speech at the UN emergency session, also followed Johnson, using the cliché of "nuclear annihilation" to threaten the revolutionary peoples of the world. Obviously, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in order to maintain their remaining nuclear monopoly and continue to engage in nuclear blackmail, and in order to further direct their arrows at China and deceive the peoples of the world, are very eager to complete the "non-proliferation" treaty, this big deception, and big conspiracy.

In Johnson's speech on the 19th, he also expressed that the United States hopes to quickly reach an agreement with the Soviet revisionists on the issue of establishing an anti-ballistic missile system. This is another nuclear deal that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been brewing since the beginning of this year. According to Rusk's recent revelation, the U.S. government is plotting to conspire with the Soviet revisionists to jointly establish an "international anti-missile system" aimed at China.

In the past half year or so, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in order to promote the U.S.-Soviet global big deal and accelerate the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, have engaged in unprecedentedly frequent collusion in "improving East-West relations," expanding trade, economic relations, and cultural and scientific exchanges, and have made many big and small deals. This also indicates that the Soviet revisionist traitors are willing to completely throw themselves into the arms of U.S. imperialism.

The target of U.S.-Soviet collusion is China

The counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in all aspects is primarily directed at China and is coordinated with their frenzied anti-China activities. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China was launched with great fanfare, the anti-China "joint actions" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union reached an unprecedented level of frenzy. The leaders of the two families and their propaganda machines have intensified their use of every opportunity and occasion to collaborate in spreading various vile and shameful rumors, slanders, and attacks against the great Chinese people. In this regard, the Soviet revisionist leaders have been particularly active, repeatedly acting as the vanguard of anti-China activities. They have repeatedly rallied their domestic and international lackeys and henchmen to launch one anti-China campaign after another, and at the same time, in accordance with Khrushchev's will, have repeatedly plotted to convene anti-China traitor and scab gatherings. They have also repeatedly taken the lead and incited their followers to take serious steps to worsen relations with China, committing many bad deeds that Khrushchev did not dare to do. Even the imperialist press of the U.S. admits that the Soviet revisionists' anti-China activities have reached a "shocking" level. In addition, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have colluded to intensify their collusion with the reactionaries and puppet regimes of Japan, India, Indonesia, and other Asian countries and regions, actively forming and strengthening the anti-China "encirclement," attempting to threaten socialist China, which is advancing bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to block its enormous influence in the international arena.

In recent days, the U.S. imperialist press has also been clamoring that China's successful hydrogen bomb test has made the talks between Johnson and Kosygin "more important and urgent." This means that in the face of China's growing national defense capabilities and unprecedentedly high international prestige, the U.S. and the Soviet Union must redouble their efforts to tighten their counter-revolutionary global collusion to oppose the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union are engaging in unprecedentedly close and unprecedentedly open counter-revolutionary global collusion, which is a manifestation of their difficulties and desperate situation in the face of the surging revolutionary waves of the world. They are struggling to their death to launch a counterattack against the revolutionary peoples of the world. However, the revolutionary peoples of the world are precisely from their intensified collusion to further recognize that: to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism; one must carry out the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and Soviet-centered modern revisionism to the end. The revolutionary peoples of the world firmly believe in the truth pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly achieve victory, be it sooner or later."

    柯西金美国之行是苏修露骨推行全面投降叛卖政策的新发展
    美帝苏修正在结成反华反革命的联盟
    据新华社二十二日讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团头目柯西金以出席联合国大会紧急会议为名，亲自跑到美国去同美帝国主义头目策划进一步出卖世界各国人民的革命利益的大阴谋，这标志着美苏反革命全球大勾结正在进入一个更加紧密、更加露骨的新阶段。这是苏修领导集团在美帝国主义反革命全球战略加速破产的过程中，适应美帝的需要，起来大帮其忙，实行全面的投降、叛卖政策的新发展。
  “一揽子交易”是反革命大阴谋
    柯西金的这次美国之行，是赫鲁晓夫下台后苏修新领导头目第一次在美国的土地上同美帝头目直接策划全球性的大勾结。从已经透露出来的大量消息来看，美苏正在进行的勾结的目的，是要就越南、中东等一系列问题搞所谓“一揽子交易”，也就是要借助它们在中东进行空前紧密
  “合作”的形势，进一步推进它们镇压越南人民、阿拉伯人民和世界革命人民的反革命大阴谋。十九日，约翰逊在华盛顿，柯西金在纽约，一前一后地发表讲话，一个希望美苏在各方面“采取共同行动”，另一个就鼓吹美苏“找到共同语言”——他们实际上已经为扩大“共同行动”开始了“直接对话”。与此同时，葛罗米柯和腊斯克频频密谈，美苏的官员积极地为柯西金—约翰逊的直接会谈奔波。这些情况表明，苏修新头目正在进行一场远远超过赫鲁晓夫的全球大出卖。
    美苏全球大勾结的这一新发展决不是偶然的。苏修新领导上台以来，在同美帝进行反革命勾结方面，早就比他们的前任赫鲁晓夫走得更远了。特别是在去年九、十月间葛罗米柯到美国去同美帝头目约翰逊和腊斯克连续密谈以来，美苏全面勾结有了明显的、迅速的发展，它们事实上已经结成了一个反华、反共、反人民、反革命的联盟。
    合谋扑灭越南人民革命烈火
    在越南问题上，苏修新领导上台不久把赫鲁晓夫的“脱身”政策改为“插手”政策，力图用假支持、真出卖的两面手法，把越南人民的抗美救国斗争纳入“苏美合作主宰世界”的轨道。这种做法完全适应着已被越南人民打得狼狈不堪、走投无路的美帝国主义的需要。在去年葛罗米柯同约翰逊和腊斯克密谋策划之后，苏修越来越频繁和越来越露骨地帮助美帝推行“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。今年二月间，柯西金访问英国，同美帝政治掮客、英国首相威尔逊密商“停炸诱和”的把戏，使苏修的叛卖活动达到空前露骨的程度。同时，苏修还积极配合美帝扩大侵越战争，一方面在欧洲大搞“缓和”，使美国可以放手实行军事力量东移，不断增加侵越炮灰；另一方面疯狂地加紧反华，妄图挑拨中越人民的战斗团结。所有这些，充分暴露了苏修叛徒充当美帝头号帮凶和别动队的真面目。
    由于越南人民在中国人民和全世界革命人民支持下，坚持要把神圣的抗美救国战争进行到底，而且不断取得辉煌胜利，美苏在越南问题上玩弄的大阴谋，一再遭到可耻的破产。但是，美帝和苏修这一对反革命伙伴对于它们的失败总是不甘心的，它们时时都在想如何更加紧密地勾结在一起，共同扑灭越南人民革命斗争的烈火。现在，在美帝和苏修看来，美苏在中东的“合作”已经给“解决越南冲突”创造了“更好的气氛”，在这种情况下，柯西金又亲自去找美帝头目一起策划诱压越南人民投降的新阴谋，这充分暴露出了苏修要大搞叛卖活动的心情是何等的急切。
  “防止核扩散”交易加速进行
    与此同时，在制造出卖世界人民利益的核骗局方面，美帝和苏修长期以来，就在进行着一项比一九六三年美英苏部分禁止核试验条约更为重大的肮脏交易——缔结所谓“防止核扩散”条约。从去年九、十月间以来，特别是在中国连续成功地试验核武器的情况下，这项交易的步伐大大地加快了。去年以来，美苏利用联合国大会这个政治交易所，一再鼓吹要加速缔结这项条约。今年初，它们又把签订所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”作为促进“防止核扩散”大交易的一个步骤。今年二月以来，美苏更利用日内瓦“裁军”会议，加紧兜售这项大骗局。
    在这笔交易讨价还价的过程中，苏修曾不断向美帝作出重大的让步和妥协。正因此，腊斯克最近公开表示，在缔结这个条约的问题上已经取得相当大的进展，美苏已经解决了条约中的主要问题。现在，约翰逊在十九日的讲话中又明确表示“希望马上”就这个条约达成协议。柯西金在联大紧急会议上讲话时也追随约翰逊，用“核毁灭”的滥调来恫吓世界革命人民。显然，美帝和苏修为了保持它们的残存的核垄断和继续实行核讹诈，为了进一步把矛头指向中国和欺骗世界人民，十分急于完成“防止核扩散”条约这项大骗局、大阴谋。
    约翰逊在十九日的讲话中还表示，美国希望同苏修就有关建立反弹道导弹体系的问题很快达成协议。这是从今年年初以来美苏一直在酝酿的另一项核交易。据腊斯克不久前透露，美国政府正在阴谋策划同苏修共同建立一个矛头针对中国的“国际反导弹系统”。
    最近半年多以来，美帝和苏修为了促进美苏全球大交易和加速在苏联和东欧一些国家全面复辟资本主义，在“改善东西方关系”，扩大贸易、经济关系和文化、科学交流等方面，也进行了空前频繁的勾结，搞成了许多大大小小的交易。这也表明，苏修叛徒心甘情愿地彻底投入美帝怀抱。
    苏美勾结的矛头指向中国
    美帝和苏修在各方面的反革命勾结，其主要矛头都是指向中国的，也都是同它们的猖狂反华活动相配合的。在中国的无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开展起来以后，美苏的反华“联合行动”达到了前所未有的疯狂程度。美苏两家的头目以及他们的御用宣传机器，加紧利用一切场合和一切机会，互相配合，对伟大的中国人民进行各种卑劣无耻的造谣、诬蔑和攻击。在这方面，苏修头目们特别卖力，一再充当反华急先锋。他们不断纠合国内外的喽罗、走卒，掀起一次又一次的反华高潮，同时又秉承赫鲁晓夫的遗志，一再策划召开反华的叛徒工贼大集会。他们还多次带头并唆使他们的追随者，采取恶化同中国的国家关系的严重步骤，干下了许多当年赫鲁晓夫没有敢干的坏事。连美帝国主义的报刊也承认，苏修反华已经达到了“惊人的”程度。除此以外，美苏两家还串通一气，加紧勾结日本、印度、印尼等亚洲国家和地区的反动派和傀儡集团，积极拼凑和加强反华“包围圈”，妄图威胁高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的社会主义中国和阻挡它在国际上的巨大影响。
    最近几天，美帝的报刊还纷纷叫嚷，中国爆炸氢弹成功使得约翰逊和柯西金举行会谈有了“新的重要性和更大的紧迫性”。这就是说，面对中国的国防力量的增长和国际威望的空前提高，美帝和苏修更要拚命加紧反革命全球大勾结来反对中国人民和全世界革命人民。
    美帝和苏修这样空前紧密、空前露骨地进行反革命全球大勾结，是它们在汹涌澎湃的世界革命浪潮冲击下，困难重重，穷途末路的表现，它们是在垂死的挣扎中向全世界革命人民进行反扑。但是全世界革命人民正好从它们加紧勾结的事实中进一步认识到：反帝必须反修；必须把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏联为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。全世界革命人民坚信伟大的领袖毛主席所指出的真理：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
