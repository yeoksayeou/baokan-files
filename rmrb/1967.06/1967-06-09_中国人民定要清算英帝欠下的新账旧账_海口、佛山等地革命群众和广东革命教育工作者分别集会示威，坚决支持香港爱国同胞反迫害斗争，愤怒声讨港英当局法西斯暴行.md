The Chinese people must settle the new and old accounts owed by the British Empire. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary educators in Haikou, Foshan, and other places in Guangdong held rallies and demonstrations to firmly support the struggle of Hong Kong patriots against persecution, and angrily condemn the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 8th: The activities in support of the anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle of Hong Kong patriots are surging in Haikou, Foshan, Huizhou, Zhaoqing, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Shaoguan in Guangdong Province. In recent days, revolutionary workers, peasants, students, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in these places have held meetings, parades, demonstrations, or other activities. They expressed their firm support for the just struggle of Hong Kong patriots against the fascist atrocities of British imperialism, and their resolute response to the battle call of the editorial "Firmly Repel the Provocations of British Imperialism" published in the People's Daily. They are ready at any time, upon the command of the great motherland, to stand at the forefront of the battle, supporting Hong Kong patriots in smashing the colonial reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

At various meetings and activities, the revolutionary masses exposed the decadent and barbaric crimes committed by British imperialism against Hong Kong patriots, pointing out its reactionary and decadent nature. Revolutionary cadres from the shipping line in Zhaoqing pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities, despite the strong protests of Hong Kong patriots and the 700 million Chinese people, issued the so-called "emergency regulations," creating a legal basis for "anti-violence is a crime," attempting to extinguish the flames of the anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle of Hong Kong patriots; they even brought in an aircraft carrier, openly boasting to "show strength," which is simply crazy! Chairman Mao taught us: "All the reactionaries are paper tigers." British imperialism is also a paper tiger. The more arrogant and rampant it is, the more it exposes its reactionary and decadent nature. An old worker from Haikou Canned Food Factory said, "This British imperialist paper tiger, no matter how arrogant and rampant it is, will eventually 'lift a rock only to drop it on its own feet.' A shameful failure awaits it. It will definitely be smashed to pieces in front of the great Chinese people!"

The revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised the Hong Kong patriots for their fearless sacrifice, unyielding spirit, and courageous struggle against the evil British imperialism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 8th: Nearly 5,000 revolutionary educators from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a rally today, angrily condemning the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities, and firmly supporting the just struggle of Hong Kong patriots and the education community in Hong Kong against persecution.

The presider at the meeting pointed out that for over a hundred years, British imperialism has implemented a wicked colonial rule in Hong Kong, ruthlessly exploiting and oppressing our Hong Kong compatriots, savagely suppressing the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggles of our Hong Kong compatriots, and poisoning and corrupting our Hong Kong compatriots with the decadent and corrupt Western culture. British imperialism owes a blood debt to the Chinese people, which we will never forget. All the old and new debts owed by British imperialism to the Chinese people, we must settle.

    中国人民定要清算英帝欠下的新账旧账
    海口、佛山等地革命群众和广东革命教育工作者分别集会示威，坚决支持香港爱国同胞反迫害斗争，愤怒声讨港英当局法西斯暴行
    据新华社广州八日电　广东省海口、佛山、惠州、肇庆、汕头、湛江、韶关等地支持香港爱国同胞反帝抗暴斗争的活动正在波澜壮阔地展开。连日来，这些地方的革命工人、革命农民、革命师生、红卫兵小将和革命干部，纷纷举行集会、游行示威或其他活动。他们表示，坚决支持香港爱国同胞反对英帝国主义法西斯暴行的正义斗争，坚决响应《人民日报》社论《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》发出的战斗号召，随时作好准备，只要伟大祖国一声令下，就站到战斗的最前线，支持香港爱国同胞粉碎英帝国主义在香港的殖民反动统治。
    在各种集会和活动中，广大革命群众纷纷揭露腐朽和野蛮的英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞犯下的滔天罪行，指出它的反动腐朽本质。肇庆市航运战线革命干部指出，港英当局不顾我港九爱国同胞和七亿中国人民的强烈抗议，颁布所谓“紧急法令”，制造“抗暴有罪”的法律根据，妄图扑灭我香港爱国同胞的反帝抗暴斗争的烈火；还开来了航空母舰，公然叫嚷要“显示力量”，简直疯狂到极点！毛主席教导我们：“一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。”英帝国主义也是一只纸老虎，它越嚣张越猖狂，就越暴露了它的反动腐朽的本质。海口罐头厂的一个老工人说，英帝国主义这只纸老虎，不管它怎样嚣张，怎样猖狂，到头来总是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，可耻的失败正等着它。它在伟大的中国人民面前必定要碰得粉身碎骨！
    广大革命群众热烈赞扬香港爱国同胞不怕牺牲，不畏强暴，向万恶的英帝国主义展开针锋相对的英勇斗争的硬骨头精神。
    据新华社广州八日电　广东省、广州市近五千名革命教育工作者今天举行集会，愤怒声讨港英当局的法西斯暴行，坚决支持港九爱国同胞和港九教育界反迫害的正义斗争。
    大会主持人在讲话中指出，一百多年来，英帝国主义在香港实行万恶的殖民统治，残酷剥削和虐待我港九同胞，野蛮地镇压我港九同胞的反帝爱国斗争，以没落腐朽的西方文化毒害和腐蚀我港九同胞。英帝国主义对中国人民欠下的血债累累，我们永远不会忘记。英帝国主义欠下中国人民的一切旧账、新账，我们一定要清算。
