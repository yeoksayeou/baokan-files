The revolutionary rebels of the Iqiu Forestry Comprehensive Processing Plant, with the help of the PLA, carry out ideological and political work under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and launch a major criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and the revisionists within the plant.

The report states: The Third Company of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Iqiu has helped the revolutionary workers of the Iqiu Forestry Comprehensive Processing Plant in Heilongjiang Province to closely unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and launch a major criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and the revisionists within the plant.

In 1961, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party came to this plant and peddled a large amount of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods in Iqiu. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the Iqiu area enthusiastically promoted and vigorously implemented these goods, advocating the theory of "extinction of class struggle" in the forest area, promoting the idea of "big logs in charge" and material incentives, corrupting the worker masses, and causing deep harm. During the Cultural Revolution, these people, in order to protect themselves, incited many workers to join conservative organizations and attack the revolutionary leftists. When the Third Company entered the plant to support the left, out of more than 1,300 workers in the entire plant, only 21 were revolutionary rebels, and the majority had been misled into joining conservative organizations. Thus, an extremely important task facing the supporting troops and the revolutionary rebels was to carry out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work among the broad masses.

After the Third Company entered the forestry processing plant, they first studied Chairman Mao's teachings with the revolutionary rebels: "We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind. If the proletariat cannot liberate all mankind, it cannot finally liberate itself." Through study, they realized: The proletarian revolutionary faction must be good at doing mass work, arousing the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, and the more people they can unite and educate, the more strength they will have to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They started from investigations and research, fully understanding the situation of the misled masses, conducting class analysis, and realizing that the majority of the misled masses are old workers who suffered greatly in the old society and workers of poor and lower-middle peasant origin. They love Chairman Mao, love the Communist Party, and love socialism. During the Cultural Revolution, they joined the wrong side and did the wrong things mainly because a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party waved the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, and they were temporarily deceived and misled; they are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the blame should be placed on the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The comrades from the army and the revolutionary rebels said: "We have the responsibility to help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but we do not have the right to exclude them. As long as we are good at arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and good at raising the class consciousness of the masses through patient and detailed ideological and political work, inspiring their revolutionary spirit, they will quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The comrades from the army and the revolutionary rebels adopted methods such as working in the workshops, visiting homes, understanding thoughts, making friends, talking heart-to-heart, and holding discussions to form "one-to-one" and "red pairs" with the misled masses, helping them study Chairman Mao's works, and inspiring them to realize they were deceived, put down their burdens, and recognize the evil of the bourgeois reactionary line. The comrades from the army first conducted a pilot project in the raw log workshop. An old worker in this workshop, Zhang Xianshen, suffered greatly in the old society. He loves Chairman Mao, loves the Party, and has been very active in labor since liberation; however, during the Cultural Revolution, due to being deceived by the capitalist-roaders, he joined the wrong side and did some wrong things. After the PLA comrades entered the plant, he felt ashamed and wanted to talk to someone but was afraid of being misunderstood, so he was in a very conflicted state and just kept his head down and worked. Soldier Chen Qinzeng discovered this situation and did everything he could to get close to him, forming a "red pair" with him, and patiently helping him analyze the reasons for joining the wrong side. Zhang Xianshen finally realized that he had been deceived and used, and decided to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, joining the ranks of the revolutionary rebels.

The model actions of the PLA comrades greatly inspired the revolutionary rebels. At first, some revolutionary rebels felt awkward about forming "red pairs" with the masses who had joined conservative organizations and couldn't understand it; now, from the example of Chen Qinzeng and old worker Zhang Xianshen forming a "red pair," they realized that they must, as Chairman Mao taught, "be good at uniting with those who have different opinions from us, and also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice," in order to unite with the majority of the masses. Thus, the "red pair" activity quickly spread from one workshop to the entire plant, becoming a mass activity. Worker Wang Chunhou, after withdrawing from the conservative organization, felt hopeless, his spirits were low, he had no energy to work, and he was not active in learning. Revolutionary rebel Sun Qi took the initiative to have a heart-to-heart talk with him, forming a "red pair," and together they studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "After people experience failure, they also learn lessons from failure, correct their thoughts to adapt to the laws of the external world, and people can turn failure into victory." Wang Chunhou realized that making a wrong turn is not scary, what is scary is not correcting the mistake after knowing it. Thus, he put down his mental burden and firmly stood with the revolutionary rebels.

Because of adopting the form of "red pairs," the comrades from the army, the revolutionary rebels, and the misled masses talked heart-to-heart, exchanged thoughts, and studied Chairman Mao's works together, greatly strengthening their unity, becoming a single rope, and walking on the same path. Many misled workers stood up to revolt, announced their withdrawal from conservative organizations, and joined the ranks of the revolutionary rebels.

To guide the misled masses to deeply understand the great significance of the Cultural Revolution, the comrades from the army and the revolutionary rebels organized the workers to widely carry out the activity of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, holding recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness meetings by class and workshop. At the meetings, some old workers showed the scars on their bodies, using their past history of fleeing famine, selling children, and family destruction to denounce the evil of the old society. Some workers used the contrast between the old and new societies to explain that the bitterness of the old society was due to the power being in the hands of the landlords and capitalists, and the sweetness of the new society was due to the power being in the hands of the working class and the laboring people. With power, there is everything; without power, there is nothing. Recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness made the misled masses and the revolutionary rebels love Chairman Mao even more deeply and hate the class enemies even more bitterly. Recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness made the misled masses and the revolutionary rebels closely unite together.

They also recalled together the sharp and complex struggle between restoration and anti-restoration since the Cultural Revolution, further realizing that their common enemy is the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the plant and their mastermind—the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. They closely combined with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own departments, launching a broader and deeper movement of criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. Many who were previously misled became vanguard fighters. They and the revolutionary rebels forged deep friendships in their common struggle. Everyone unanimously expressed that they must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, forever follow Chairman Mao, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

The Iqiu Forestry Comprehensive Processing Plant, through a series of ideological and political work, achieved revolutionary great unity and "three-in-one combination" in the struggle of criticism. The number of leftists has developed to one-third of the entire plant's workers, and the first "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ was established in the Iqiu forest area.

    伊春木材综合加工厂红色造反者在解放军帮助下做思想政治工作
    满腔热情和受蒙蔽的群众结成“一对红”
    全体革命职工，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下紧密团结起来，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和本厂的修正主义分子开展大批判大斗争。
    本报讯　解放军驻伊春某部三连，帮助黑龙江省伊春木材综合加工厂革命职工，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下紧密团结起来，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和本厂的修正主义分子开展大批判大斗争。
    一九六一年，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派来过这个厂，并在伊春贩卖了大量反革命修正主义货色。伊春地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大肆吹捧、极力推行这些货色，在林区鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，搞大木头挂帅、物质刺激，腐蚀工人群众，流毒很深。在文化大革命中，这一小撮人为了保住自己，又唆使很多工人群众参加保守组织，围攻革命左派。在三连进厂支左时，全厂一千三百多名职工中，只有二十一个红色造反者，大部分人都受蒙蔽参加了保守组织。这样，摆在支左部队和红色造反者面前的一个极端重要的任务，是向广大群众做深入细致的思想政治工作。
    三连进驻这个木材加工厂以后，首先同红色造反者一起学习毛主席的教导：“要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”经过学习，他们认识到：无产阶级革命派要善于做群众工作，启发群众的革命自觉性，多争取团结教育一个人，就多增加一分捍卫毛主席革命路线的力量。他们从调查研究入手，全面了解受蒙蔽群众的情况，进行阶级分析，认识到受蒙蔽群众中大部分是在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人和贫下中农出身的工人，他们热爱毛主席、热爱共产党、热爱社会主义。文化大革命中，他们站错了队，做错了事，主要是因为党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打着“红旗”反红旗，一时受了欺骗和蒙蔽；他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，应该把罪责加在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上。部队同志和红色造反者说：“我们有帮助他们回到毛主席革命路线的责任，没有排斥他们的权利。只要善于用毛泽东思想武装群众，善于通过耐心细致的思想政治工作提高群众的阶级觉悟，激发他们的革命精神，他们便会迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。”
    部队同志和红色造反者，采取了下车间劳动，到家里访问，摸思想，交朋友，谈心，座谈等方式，和受蒙蔽的群众结成“一帮一”、“一对红”，帮助他们学习毛主席著作，启发他们查上当，放包袱，认清资产阶级反动路线的罪恶。部队同志首先在原木车间试点。这个车间的老工人张显臣在旧社会受尽了苦难，他热爱毛主席，热爱党，解放后劳动一直很积极；但是在文化大革命中，由于受了走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，站错了队，做了一些错事。解放军同志进厂后，他觉得很惭愧，渴望找人谈谈，又怕被误解，心情很矛盾，就整天闷着头干活。战士陈钦增发现这个情况后，就千方百计地亲近他，和他结成“一对红”，耐心地帮助他分析站错队的原因。张显臣终于认识到自己受了蒙蔽和利用，决心回到毛主席的革命路线上来，加入了红色造反者行列。
    解放军同志的模范行动使红色造反者受到了很大启发。开始，有的红色造反者感到去同参加过保守组织的群众搞“一对红”，很别扭，想不通；现在，从陈钦增和老工人张显臣结成“一对红”的例子中，认识到必须象毛主席教导的那样：“要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”，才能团结群众大多数。于是，“一对红”活动迅速由一个车间普及到全厂，形成了群众性的活动。工人王春厚退出保守组织后，觉得没有前途，情绪消沉，干活没有劲，学习不积极。红色造反者孙歧就主动和他促膝谈心，结成“一对红”，同他一块学习毛主席的教导：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利”。王春厚认识到走错了路并不可怕，可怕的是知错不回头。于是，他放下思想包袱，坚决地与红色造反者站在一起。
    由于采取了“一对红”这样的形式，部队同志、红色造反者和受蒙蔽的群众，互相谈心，交流思想，共同学习毛主席著作，大大加强了团结，拧成了一股绳，走上了一条道。很多受蒙蔽的职工站出来革命，宣布退出保守组织，加入红色造反者队伍。
    为了引导受蒙蔽的群众深刻认识文化大革命的重大意义，部队同志和红色造反者还组织职工广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，以班组、车间为单位召开忆苦思甜会。会上，有的老工人亮出留在身上的斑斑伤痕，用过去逃荒，卖儿女，家破人亡的血泪史，控诉旧社会的罪恶。有的工人用新旧社会的对比，说明旧社会的苦，苦在政权掌握在地主资本家手里，新社会的甜，甜在政权掌握在工人阶级和劳动人民手里。有了政权，就有了一切，失掉政权，就失掉一切。忆苦思甜，使受蒙蔽的群众和红色造反者对毛主席更加无限热爱，对阶级敌人更加刻骨仇恨。忆苦思甜，使受蒙蔽的群众和红色造反者紧密地团结在一起。
    他们又一起回忆了文化大革命以来尖锐复杂的复辟与反复辟斗争，进一步认识到共同的敌人是厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们的总后台——党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。他们紧紧结合本部门的斗批改，掀起了对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派更广泛、更深入的大批判、大斗争运动。过去受蒙蔽的群众，很多人成了冲锋陷阵的闯将。他们和红色造反者在共同战斗中，结下了深厚的友谊。大家一致表示，要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，永远跟着毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    伊春木材综合加工厂，就是这样通过一系列的思想政治工作，在大批判中实现了革命的大联合和“三结合”。左派队伍的人数已发展到占全厂职工的五分之三，在伊春林区第一个建立了“三结合”临时权力机构。
