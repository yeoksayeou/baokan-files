A certain intelligence unit of the Nanjing Military Region encountered a difficult situation. A young man surnamed Li, who had been deceived, would come every day to argue, saying that the intelligence unit had made a mistake in supporting the left. Sergeant Liu Daozhong wanted to talk to him. But as soon as he opened his mouth, Li would shout, "I just want you to admit your mistake, I don't want you to do ideological work." He wouldn't let Liu Daozhong continue. This happened once, twice, three times, and Liu Daozhong couldn't stand it anymore, thinking of driving him away. But then he thought, this young man dares to come to the military every day to argue, which shows that he considers the military as his own and believes that the military is reasonable. But when it comes to reasoning, he doesn't listen. What should he do?

Liu Daozhong studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "All problems of a ideological nature and all problems of controversy among the people should be resolved by the democratic method, the method of discussion, of criticism, of persuasion and education, and not by the method of compulsion or repression." Liu Daozhong, hearing Chairman Mao's words, patiently and repeatedly explained to the young man amidst his shouting. At first, he would only shout and not listen, but after a few times, he would only listen and not shout, and after listening, he would no longer come. It seemed that his thoughts had begun to be stirred.

Had he really understood? Liu Daozhong was not at ease and found out his address, going to his home. Indeed, he had understood his mistake, but he still lacked the resolve to correct it. He thought that he had originally made the mistake of joining a conservative organization, and after the army's support for the left, he had made the mistake of not believing the army, feeling that he could not hold his head up and could not face people. He wanted to correct his mistake, but he was afraid that others would not believe him, lacking the courage to correct his mistake.

Liu Daozhong had many heart-to-heart talks with him and studied Chairman Mao's works together. Chairman Mao taught us: "To persist in what is right and correct what is wrong for the people's interests." These two sentences had a great impact on him. Thus, with Liu Daozhong's patient and enthusiastic help, he summoned the courage to actively expose and struggle against those in power who were taking the capitalist road, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and became a revolutionary fighter. Later, he often reported his thoughts and work to Liu Daozhong, continuing to receive Liu Daozhong's patient and enthusiastic help.

Liu Daozhong was about to return to his base, packing his bag, when this young man came to see him. He didn't even have time to enter the door, leaning on the window and crying. He cried and said, "You can't leave! It was you who helped me stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If you leave, I'm afraid I won't be able to stand firm." Liu Daozhong affectionately told him, "Whether you can stand firm or not depends on Mao Zedong Thought, not on us; with Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how big the waves are, you can stand as firm as a mountain; without Mao Zedong Thought, even in calm waters, your legs will shake." He wiped his tears, looking at Liu Daozhong with gratitude, solemnly declaring: He would definitely study Chairman Mao's works diligently, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

    从只吵不听到只听不吵
    南京部队某部特务连碰到了一件难办的事。有个姓李的受蒙蔽的青年，天天跑来吵吵嚷嚷，说特务连支左支错了。排长刘道忠想和他谈谈。但一开口，他就大叫：“我只要你承认错误，不要你做思想工作。”不让刘道忠说下去。一次、两次、三次没谈成，刘道忠耐不住了，想赶他走。一转念又觉得，这个青年人敢天天来找军队吵嚷，说明他把军队看成是自己的军队，相信军队是讲道理的。可是说理他又不听，怎么办呢？
    刘道忠带着问题学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决”。刘道忠听了毛主席的话，就在这个青年的吵嚷声中，耐心地反复地向他讲道理。开初他还是光吵不听，可是，几次以后他就光听不吵了，而且听完了也不再来了。看来他的思想开始被触动了。
    他是不是真想通了呢？刘道忠放心不下，想办法打听到他的住址，跑到他家里去，果然一了解，他对自己的错误虽然想通了，可是，对怎样改正错误还没有决心。他认为，自己本来就犯了参加保守组织的错误，解放军支左以后，又犯了不相信解放军的错误，觉得抬不起头，见不得人。想改正，又怕别人不相信自己，缺乏改正的勇气。
    刘道忠多次同他耐心地谈，同他一起学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。”这两句话对他启发很大。于是他在刘道忠耐心热情的帮助下鼓起了勇气，积极揭发和斗争党内走资本主义道路当权派，回到了毛主席的革命路线上来，并且成了革命派的一名战士。以后，他还常常向刘道忠汇报思想和工作，继续得到刘道忠耐心热情的帮助。
    刘道忠要回驻地去，正在打背包，这位青年跑来看见了，连门也没来得及进，趴在窗口就哭起来。他边哭边说：“你不能走呀！是你帮助我站到毛主席的革命路线一边的，你走了，我怕又要站不稳了。”刘道忠亲切地告诉他：“站不站得稳，靠的是毛泽东思想，不是靠我们；掌握了毛泽东思想，风浪再大，也能站得稳如泰山；离开毛泽东思想，风平浪静，腿肚子也要发软。”他擦干眼泪，用感激的目光望着刘道忠，严肃地表示：一定努力学习毛主席著作，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。　高　政
