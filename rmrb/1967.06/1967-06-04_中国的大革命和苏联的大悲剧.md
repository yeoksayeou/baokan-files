Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from the very beginning, struck at the very nerve center of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, shaking their tottering "throne."

For an entire year, the Soviet revisionist clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin has hardly had a day without viciously slandering, attacking, and cursing our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have spewed out a string of nonsense, claiming that China's Cultural Revolution is a "great tragedy."

Is this phenomenon strange? No, not at all. Throughout history, every truly great revolution has been seen as a day of joy by the revolutionary people, while being seen as a great tragedy by reactionary forces.

When the great Paris Commune was born in 1871, Marx called it the proletariat's "grandest holiday." But the European monarchs and bourgeois rulers cried out in horror, calling it a "terrible disaster."

When the "Aurora" cruiser fired its cannon in 1917, heralding the triumph of the great October Revolution in Russia, the proletarians and revolutionary people of the world felt so inspired and uplifted! But the imperialists and the traitors of the Second International gnashed their teeth, claiming that this was the "last act" of the Russian Revolution, a "tyranny" and "adventurism" of the Bolsheviks.

When the great Chinese Revolution achieved victory in 1949, the people of the whole of China and the world were overjoyed! But U.S. imperialism was in a state of panic, crying out that the situation in China was "unfortunate," "tragic," and the "most unpleasant period"!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in our country is a deeper and more extensive revolutionary movement than the Paris Commune, the October Revolution, and all previous revolutions in China. Such a great revolution naturally provokes the howls and curses of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and all reactionary forces in the world. Is this not a completely lawful phenomenon?

After the October Revolution in Russia, Lenin pointed out that who were the ones cursing the Soviet power first established by the Russian working class? They were "all the bourgeois scoundrels, all the blood-sucking gangs, and their singers, Kautsky."

Today's Brezhnev and Kosygin are precisely the descendants of the traitors Kautsky whom Lenin angrily denounced. Their frenzied cursing of China's Cultural Revolution as a "great tragedy" is precisely a great exposure of their counter-revolutionary faces.

In the contemporary international communist movement, a great tragedy has indeed occurred. This great tragedy did not happen in China; it happened in the Soviet Union. The creators of this great tragedy are none other than the great traitor and great saboteur clique represented by Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin.

Today, in the homeland of Leninism, the great banner of Lenin has been desecrated and toppled by the Khrushchev revisionist clique, and revisionism has taken control there.

Today, in the first socialist country in the world, founded by Lenin, proletarian dictatorship has been transformed into bourgeois dictatorship, capitalism has been restored, and the socialist state has changed color.

Today, the Soviet people, who had built great achievements under the guidance of Lenin and the leadership of Stalin, have once again fallen into a state of oppression and exploitation. The revolutionary fruits they had gained through long-term struggles and countless sacrifices have been snatched away.

Today, the Soviet Union, which was once regarded by the people of the whole world as the base of world revolution and yearned for by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, has its ruling clique become the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and another stronghold of world reactionary forces. The red star on the Kremlin has lost its luster.

What a shocking picture! What a serious historical setback!

In the history of the international communist movement, there has hardly been a socialist country whose proletarian dictatorship was overthrown by the international bourgeoisie through external armed attacks. However, a fortress is most easily breached from within. Now, the dying imperialists, while threatening socialist countries with war from the outside, mainly use the Khrushchev clique to subvert from within. They did not spend a single soldier or bullet, and yet they carried out a "peaceful evolution" in the Soviet Union. Is this not a great historical lesson?

The historical setback in the Soviet Union has placed the international communist movement in front of an extremely important new task: how can the proletariat, after seizing power, hold onto this power and prevent the restoration of capitalism? How can the socialist revolution be carried out to the end in the midst of acute and complex class struggles? This great question is one that all the predecessors of Marxism-Leninism either did not encounter, did not have time to solve, or could not solve.

It is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our brilliant leader Chairman Mao, and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by him, that has solved this problem theoretically and answered it through the revolutionary practice of hundreds of millions of people.

The tragedy in the Soviet Union occurred precisely because the proletarian dictatorship was usurped by the Khrushchev revisionist clique. This cunning and long-plotting ambitious schemer and his gang, after the death of the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, saw their opportunity and staged a palace coup, stealing the party, military, and state power of the Soviet Union. From then on, the nature of the Soviet power changed, bourgeois dictatorship replaced proletarian dictatorship, and the bourgeoisie, through its agents, carried out a counter-revolutionary restoration.

As Chairman Mao pointed out, "The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship."

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has precisely drawn this serious historical lesson from the Soviet Union.

This great revolution has deeply educated and tempered the Chinese people and has also deeply educated and influenced the revolutionary people of the whole world. In China and throughout the world, millions of revolutionary masses, through their personal experiences and observations of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through comparison and analysis, are further arming themselves with the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong. And once revolutionary theory is grasped by the masses, it will release boundless great material forces to transform the world.

Through this great revolution, all revolutionary people have come to understand more clearly that in the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship, there are classes and class struggles in society, and there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Therefore, there is also a long-term danger of capitalist restoration.

Through this great revolution, all revolutionary people have come to understand more clearly that under proletarian dictatorship, the most fundamental class struggle is still the issue of power. The proletariat wants to consolidate its power, and the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the proletarian power. The proletariat wants to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. This is a life-and-death struggle. If we lose vigilance, the state power will be usurped by figures like Khrushchev, and the proletarian power will be lost again.

Through this Cultural Revolution, all revolutionary people have come to understand more clearly that the danger of capitalist restoration mainly comes from the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the proletarian dictatorship organs, from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The contradiction between the proletariat and this handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road is the main contradiction in socialist society. This is the concentrated expression of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the concentrated expression of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. This handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are the main targets of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship.

Through this Cultural Revolution, all revolutionary people have come to understand more clearly that the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is of great importance and necessity. Chairman Mao said: "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion, one must first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Therefore, "the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." If the proletariat does not thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie in the ideological and cultural revolution, then the bourgeoisie will first attack the proletariat from the ideological and cultural front, and the proletarian power can still be seized by the bourgeoisie, and everything that the laboring people have fought for can still be destroyed in an instant.

Through this Cultural Revolution, all revolutionary people have come to understand more clearly that proletarian democracy is the best form of mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary struggles under proletarian dictatorship. The revolutionary proletarian faction and the broad revolutionary masses, from the bottom up, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement, root out figures like Khrushchev, expose the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, overthrow and fight them, seize power from their hands, and ensure that proletarian power is firmly in the hands of the revolutionary proletarian faction.

Chairman Mao teaches us: the current Cultural Revolution is only the first one, and in the future, it will necessarily be carried out many times. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, capitalist restoration can occur at any time. All party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be very vigilant and never relax.

In summary, through this great revolution, all revolutionary people have come to understand more clearly the laws of development of socialist society, the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and the laws of revolution under proletarian dictatorship. All of this is the result of our great leader Chairman Mao deeply summarizing the historical experience of the international proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, especially drawing the historical lessons of the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, analyzing the contradictions in socialist society, and creatively developing the great achievements of Marxism-Leninism.

Marx and Engels analyzed the contradictions of capitalist society, discovered the law of the inevitable demise of capitalism, and established the theory of scientific socialism.

Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, analyzed the contradictions of imperialism, solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of achieving proletarian dictatorship in one country.

Chairman Mao further developed Marxism-Leninism, solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in contemporary times, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of carrying out revolution under proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration. This is a great leap in the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism, marking the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Thus, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution launched on the basis of the scientific theory discovered by Chairman Mao not only prevented the tragedy of the Soviet Union from recurring in China, shattered the dreams of imperialism and revisionism of restoring capitalism in China, but also opened up a new era in the international communist movement and opened up a new era of world socialist revolution by the proletariat. China's Cultural Revolution, for the proletarians and revolutionary people of the whole world, is a great joy, a great hope, a great inspiration, and a triumphant song of the international proletariat that resonates through the clouds. But for imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, it is truly a great pain, a great disaster, and a great sorrow. Because their doomsday bells have rung, their end is near, and their "thrones" are about to collapse!

In human history, one social system replacing another always goes through twists and turns. The bourgeois revolution, which replaces one system of exploitation with another, is like this; the proletarian revolution, which aims to abolish all systems of exploitation, is even less likely to be free from twists and turns. From the standpoint of historical materialism, the historical setback created by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is but an episode in history. It is a bad thing. But Chairman Mao has summed up the positive and negative historical experiences, found the path to prevent capitalist restoration, and thus this bad thing has turned into a good thing.

We are now in a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world, with the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly sweep away the entire old world, drive imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, these demons and ghosts, out of the stage of history.

    中国的大革命和苏联的大悲剧
    观察家
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，从一开始就触痛了苏修叛徒集团的中枢神经，震撼了他们的支离歪斜的“宝座”。
    在整整一年的时间里，以勃列日?夫和柯西金为首的苏修集团，几乎没有一天不对我国的无产阶级文化大革命进行恶毒的诬蔑、攻击和咒骂。他们发出一连串的胡言乱语，说什么中国的文化大革命是一个“大悲剧”。
    这种现象，难道是奇怪的吗？不，一点也不奇怪。古往今来，凡是真正伟大的革命，都为革命人民看作是欢乐的节日，而被反动势力看作是大悲剧。
    当一八七一年伟大的巴黎公社诞生时，马克思称之为无产阶级“最盛大的节日”。而欧洲的君主和资产阶级统治者，则惊呼为“可怕的灾难”。
    当一九一七年“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰一声炮响，伟大的俄国十月革命高奏凯歌的时候，全世界无产者和革命人民是感到多么振奋和鼓舞呵！而帝国主义和第二国际的叛徒们却咬牙切齿，胡说什么这是俄国革命的“最后一幕”，是布尔什维克的“专横”和“冒险行动”。
    当一九四九年伟大的中国革命取得胜利时，全中国人民和全世界人民又是何等欣喜若狂呵！但美帝国主义却丧魂落魄地叫喊：“中国的局面”是“不幸的”、“悲惨的”，是“最不愉快的时期”！
    目前我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是比巴黎公社、十月革命和中国过去历次的革命都更深刻、规模更大的革命运动。这样的一场大革命，激起了苏修叛徒集团和世界上一切反动势力的咆哮、咒骂，岂不是完全合乎规律的现象吗？
    列宁在俄国十月革命以后曾经指出，究竟是什么人咒骂俄国劳动阶级第一次创立的苏维埃呢？是“所有的资产阶级恶棍，所有的喝血的匪帮，以及他们的讴歌者考茨基”。
    今天的勃列日?夫、柯西金之流，正是列宁所愤怒地痛斥过的叛徒考茨基的徒子徒孙。他们疯狂地咒骂中国的文化大革命是什么“大悲剧”，恰恰是他们的反革命面目的大暴露。
    在当代的国际共产主义运动中，确实出现了一个大悲剧。这个大悲剧不是发生在中国，正是发生在苏联。这个大悲剧的制造者不是别人，正是以赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日?夫、柯西金之流为代表的大叛徒、大工贼集团。
    今天，在列宁主义的故乡，伟大列宁的旗帜被赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团所糟蹋，所砍倒，修正主义在那里占了统治地位。
    今天，在列宁亲手缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联，无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，资本主义复辟了，社会主义江山改变了颜色。
    今天，曾经在列宁的教导下和斯大林的领导下建立了丰功伟绩的苏联人民，又重新处于被压迫、被剥削的地位。他们在长时期的斗争中以无数鲜血浇灌而获得的革命果实被剥夺了。
    今天，曾经被全世界人民看作是世界革命根据地，为亿万革命人民所向往的苏联，那里的统治集团已经成为美帝国主义的头号帮凶，成为世界反动势力的又一个大本营。克里姆林宫上的红星熄灭了它的光辉。
    这是一幅多么令人触目惊心的图画啊！这是一个多么严重的历史大倒退啊！
    在国际共产主义运动史上，几乎没有一个社会主义国家的无产阶级政权，是被国际资产阶级从外部进行武装进攻打垮的。但是，堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。现在，日暮途穷的帝国主义，在对社会主义国家从外部进行战争恫吓的同时，而主要利用赫鲁晓夫集团从内部进行颠覆，它们不费一兵一卒，一枪一弹，就在苏联实行了“和平演变”。这难道不是一个极大的历史教训吗？
    苏联发生的历史大倒退，使得国际共产主义运动面临一个极端重大的新课题，这就是：无产阶级取得政权以后，怎样才能保住这个政权，防止资本主义复辟？怎样才能在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，把社会主义革命进行到底？这个大问题，是所有前辈的马克思列宁主义者，或者没有遇到过，或者没有来得及解决，或者没有能够解决的。
    正是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们的天才的领袖毛主席，正是毛主席所亲自领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，从理论上解决了这个问题，而且通过亿万人民的惊天动地的革命实践回答了这个问题。
    苏联的悲剧之所以发生，最根本的一个教训，就是无产阶级的政权被赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团所篡夺。赫鲁晓夫这个混进党内的蓄谋已久的大野心家及其一伙，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林逝世之后，觉得时机已到，就发动宫廷政变，盗窃了苏联的党权、军权和政权。从此，苏联的政权就改变了性质，资产阶级专政代替了无产阶级专政，资产阶级通过它的代理人实现了反革命复辟。
    正如毛主席所指出的那样，“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，正是吸取了苏联的这个严重的历史教训。
    这场大革命，极其深刻地教育和锻炼了中国人民，同时也极其深刻地教育和影响着全世界的革命人民。在中国，在全世界，千千万万的革命群众，通过对中国无产阶级文化大革命的亲身感受和观察，经过比较和分析，正在进一步地用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来。而革命理论一旦为群众所掌握，就会迸发出无穷无尽的改造世界的伟大物质力量。
    经过这场大革命，一切革命的人们越来越清楚地懂得，在无产阶级专政的整个历史时代，社会上存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。因此，也就长期存在着资本主义复辟的危险。
    经过这场大革命，一切革命的人们越来越清楚地懂得，无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，千条万条，最根本的一条，仍然是政权问题。无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级的政权。无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。这是一个生死的斗争。如果我们丧失警惕，国家政权就会被赫鲁晓夫那样的人物所篡夺，无产阶级的政权就会得而复失。
    经过这次文化大革命，一切革命的人们越来越清楚地懂得，资本主义复辟的危险，主要来自混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。无产阶级同这一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是社会主义社会里的主要矛盾。这是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级斗争的集中表现，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的集中表现。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象。
    经过这次文化大革命，一切革命的人们越来越清楚地懂得，无产阶级在意识形态领域里同资产阶级进行的阶级斗争，具有极大的重要性和必要性。毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”因此，“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”如果无产阶级不在思想和文化革命中彻底战胜资产阶级，那么资产阶级就会首先从思想和文化这个阵地向无产阶级进攻，无产阶级政权就仍然可以被资产阶级夺去，劳动人民斗争得来的一切仍然可以毁于一旦。
    经过这场文化大革命，一切革命的人们越来越清楚地懂得，无产阶级大民主是无产阶级专政条件下发动群众进行革命斗争的最好形式。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，自下而上地开展无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，把赫鲁晓夫那样的人物揪出来，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭露出来，批倒斗倒，从他们手里夺权，保证无产阶级政权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。
    毛主席教导我们：现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
    总之，经过这场大革命，一切革命的人们越来越清楚地懂得了社会主义社会的发展规律，社会主义社会里阶级斗争的规律，无产阶级专政条件下革命的规律。所有这一切，都是我们伟大领袖毛主席深刻地总结了国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是吸取了苏联的资本主义复辟的历史教训，分析了社会主义社会的矛盾，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的伟大成果。
    马克思和恩格斯分析了资本主义社会的矛盾，发现了资本主义必然灭亡的规律，创立了科学社会主义学说。
    列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，分析了帝国主义的矛盾，解决了帝国主义时代无产阶级革命的一系列问题，解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题。
    毛主席又发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是马克思列宁主义革命学说的一个极大的飞跃，标志着马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    这样，根据毛主席发现的科学理论所发动的中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅防止了苏联的悲剧在中国的重演，粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的梦想，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新纪元，开辟了无产阶级社会主义世界革命的新时代。
    中国的文化大革命，对于全世界的无产者和革命人民来说，是莫大的喜事，是伟大的希望，是极大的鼓舞，是国际无产阶级的一曲最激动人心的响彻云霄的凯歌。但是，对于帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团来说，却千真万确地是大痛苦、大灾难、大悲哀。因为，他们的丧钟敲响了，他们的末日临近了，他们的“宝座”快要倒塌了！
    在人类历史上，一种社会制度代替另一种社会制度，总要经过曲折和反复。资产阶级革命，是用一种剥削制度代替另一种剥削制度，尚且如此；无产阶级革命，是要消灭一切剥削制度，更不可能设想不经过曲折和反复。用历史唯物主义观点来看，苏修领导集团这一伙大叛徒在苏联制造的历史大倒退，也不过是历史上的一个插曲。它是一件大坏事。但是毛主席总结了正面的和反面的历史经验，找到了防止资本主义复辟的道路，这样，这件大坏事也就变为一件大好事了。
    我们正处在以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，有了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就一定会把整个旧世界打得落花流水，把帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派这些妖魔鬼怪统统赶出历史舞台。
