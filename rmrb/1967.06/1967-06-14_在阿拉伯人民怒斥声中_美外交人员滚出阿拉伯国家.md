Under the curses of the Arab people, American diplomats leave Arab countries.

According to Xinhua News Agency, due to the direct involvement of American imperialism in the mad invasion of Arab countries, many Arab countries have severed diplomatic relations with the United States. American embassy personnel have been leaving these countries amidst the condemnation of the Arab people.

According to a statement by the U.S. State Department spokesperson on the 12th in Washington, American ambassadors and embassy personnel have already or are in the process of withdrawing from seven countries that have severed diplomatic relations with the United States. These seven countries are the United Arab Republic, Syria, Algeria, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, and Mauritania.

These American diplomats left amidst the surging anti-American tide in Arab countries, under the angry shouts of the Arab people condemning American imperialism. Before their departure, the people of these seven countries had held massive demonstrations in front of the American embassies. The demonstrators also smashed the American embassies in the United Arab Republic, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and other countries, expressing their deep indignation at the crimes of American imperialist aggression.

In the United Arab Republic, when a group of American embassy personnel left Cairo by train, the people of the United Arab Republic held a demonstration at the train station, chanting slogans, and condemning the numerous crimes committed by American imperialism. In Syria, American embassy personnel secretly burned documents and, under the surveillance of Syrian armed police, slunk out of the country.

    在阿拉伯人民怒斥声中
    美外交人员滚出阿拉伯国家
    据新华社十三日讯　由于美帝国主义直接参与对阿拉伯国家的疯狂侵略，许多阿拉伯国家同美国断绝了外交关系，美国驻这些国家的使馆人员在阿拉伯人民的一片声讨声中纷纷滚了出去。
    据美国国务院发言人十二日在华盛顿宣布，美国大使和使馆人员已经或正在从七个已经同美国断绝外交关系的国家陆续撤走。这七个国家是阿联、叙利亚、阿尔及利亚、伊拉克、也门、苏丹和毛里塔尼亚。
    这些美国外交人员是在阿拉伯国家反美怒潮汹涌、阿拉伯人民痛斥美帝国主义的怒吼声中滚开的。在他们离开之前，这七个国家的人民都曾经在美国使馆前面举行了声势浩大的示威，示威群众还砸了美国驻阿联、叙利亚、也门、苏丹等国的使馆，表示对美帝国主义侵略罪行的极大愤慨。
    在阿联，当美国大使馆一批人员乘火车离开开罗的时候，阿联人民在火车站举行示威，高呼口号，痛斥美帝国主义所犯下的累累罪行。在叙利亚，美国使馆人员鬼鬼祟祟地烧毁了文件，在叙利亚武装警察的监视下灰溜溜地离开了这个国家。
