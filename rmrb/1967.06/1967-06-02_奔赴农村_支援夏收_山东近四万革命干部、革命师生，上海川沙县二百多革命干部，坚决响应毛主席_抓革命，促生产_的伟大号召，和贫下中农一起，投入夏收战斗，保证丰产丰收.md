Nearly 40,000 revolutionary cadres and students from Shandong, and over 200 revolutionary cadres from Shanghai's Chuansha County, have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production." They are working alongside poor and lower-middle peasants to engage in the summer harvest battle, ensuring a bumper harvest.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, JINAN — Nearly 40,000 revolutionary cadres and students from Shandong Province and Jinan City have actively responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "seize the revolution and promote production." They have gone in batches to the suburbs of Jinan to help the people's communes harvest wheat.

	To help the commune members harvest the ripe wheat completely and timely, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Production Command Department issued a notice on May 24 titled "Notice on the Participation of Cadres in Wheat Harvesting." Some school revolutionary organizations have also made arrangements for participating in the wheat harvest and the cultural revolution.

	The broad masses of cadres and students participating in the summer harvest are ordinary commune members during labor and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought during rest. They bring "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and use rest time to study with the commune members. They say: helping the commune to harvest the ripe wheat completely is important; using every opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and arm the commune members is even more important. The broad masses of commune members expressed: they will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, promote production, and use practical actions to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's warm concern.

	The broad masses of cadres and students participating in the wheat harvest pay great attention to careful harvesting during labor, striving to ensure that not a single grain is lost. Many revolutionary students and teachers, following Chairman Mao's great instruction that intellectuals should combine with the workers and peasants, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants during labor, further strengthening their proletarian feelings and promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, SHANGHAI — At the beginning of the summer harvest season, the revolutionary cadres of the county-level organs in Shanghai's Chuansha County have resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "seize the revolution and promote production." With high revolutionary enthusiasm and a new fighting posture, they have rushed to the summer harvest frontline, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They are determined to do a good job in the "three summers" of summer harvest, summer sowing, and summer management, and are sworn to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	The summer crops in Chuansha County are already guaranteed to have a bumper harvest, with the average yield per mu of wheat and rapeseed both exceeding last year's. Currently, the entire county is filled with a joyous atmosphere of harvest. The harvest fields are adorned with flying red flags, and portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought quotations are displayed at the fieldheads. Many young commune members carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and are busily harvesting in the wheat and rapeseed fields.

	The leaders of the Chuansha County Revolutionary Committee and the County People's Armed Forces Department Production Office discussed how to firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production to achieve a complete victory in the "three summers" before the summer harvest began. Everyone unanimously agreed that this year's summer crops are so good because it is the fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Doing a good job in this year's summer harvest is not only related to the lives of the people across the country but also related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This battle can only be won, and it must be won! In this battle, the revolutionary cadres of the county-level organs should "charge" to the production frontline, work while laboring, be both cadres and ordinary people, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly stand on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and share the same fate and breath with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The leaders of the County Revolutionary Committee and the County Armed Forces Department Production Office, with the determination to achieve a complete victory in the summer harvest, have set an example by rushing to the agricultural production frontline; the revolutionary cadres of various departments of the county-level organs have also packed their bags, carrying the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and rushed to the grassroots. Currently, over 200 revolutionary cadres from the entire county have been sent to 27 communes to fight shoulder to shoulder with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres.

	The large number of revolutionary cadres who have gone deep into the grassroots have placed the emphasis on politics and the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, discover problems, study methods, take measures, and strive to solve various ideological problems according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

	Before going to the countryside, the revolutionary cadres of the county-level organs carefully studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant. Not understanding this point, one cannot obtain even the most elementary knowledge." They came to the countryside, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, honestly became the students of the masses, placed themselves among the masses, and seized the revolution and promoted production with the commune members. Currently, the broad masses of cadres and commune members on the summer harvest frontline are advancing with Chairman Mao's teaching of "overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory," achieving continuous victories, and fighting for a complete victory in the "three summers" work.

    奔赴农村　支援夏收
    山东近四万革命干部、革命师生，上海川沙县二百多革命干部，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，和贫下中农一起，投入夏收战斗，保证丰产丰收
    新华社济南电　山东省和济南市近四万名革命干部、革命师生积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，分批到济南郊区帮助人民公社收割小麦。
    为了帮助社员把成熟的小麦全部、及时收好，山东省革命委员会生产指挥部于五月二十四日发出了《关于机关干部参加麦收劳动的通知》。一些学校的革命组织，也对参加麦收和文化革命作了安排。
    参加夏收的广大干部和学生劳动时是普通社员，休息时是毛泽东思想宣传员，他们带着《毛主席语录》和中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，利用休息时间和社员一起学习。他们说：帮助公社把成熟的小麦全部拿到手，这很重要；利用一切时机宣传毛泽东思想，把社员武装起来，则更重要。广大社员表示：一定听毛主席的话，抓好革命，促好生产，用实际行动回答毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀。
    参加麦收的广大干部和学生，在劳动中都很注意精收细收，尽量做到颗粒不丢。许多革命师生，遵照毛主席关于知识分子要和工农群众相结合的伟大指示，在劳动中虚心向贫下中农学习，进一步增强了无产阶级感情，促进了思想革命化。
    新华社上海电　在夏收大忙季节开始的时候，上海市川沙县县级机关的革命干部，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以高昂的革命斗志，崭新的战斗姿态，纷纷奔向夏收第一线，同广大贫下中农并肩战斗，决心做好今年夏收、夏种、夏管“三夏”工作，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。
    川沙县的夏熟作物丰收已成定局，三麦、油菜籽等平均亩产量都超过去年。目前，全县到处是一派喜气洋洋的丰收景象。丰收的田野里到处红旗飘扬，田头树立着伟大领袖毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌。许多青年社员身上带着《毛主席语录》，在麦田和油菜田里紧张地收割。
    川沙县革命委员会和县人民武装部生产办公室的领导成员，早在夏收开始前，就对如何狠抓革命、猛促生产，夺取“三夏”全胜作了讨论。大家一致认为，今年夏收作物这样好，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。搞好今年的夏收，不仅关系到全国人民的生活，而且关系到无产阶级文化大革命，这一仗只能打好，只能打胜！在这场战斗中，县级机关的革命干部应该“杀”上生产第一线，边工作，边劳动，既当干部，又当老百姓，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚定地站在贫下中农一边，和贫下中农同命运，共呼吸。县革命委员会和县武装部生产办公室的领导成员，抱着誓夺夏收全胜的决心，以身作则，奔赴农业生产第一线；县级机关各部门的革命干部，也纷纷打起背包，带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，奔向基层。现在，全县已有二百多名革命干部，分赴二十七个公社，同广大贫下中农、基层干部并肩战斗。
    深入基层的大批革命干部，把突出政治、宣传毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，同社员群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，发现问题，研究办法，采取措施，努力按照毛主席的教导来解决各种思想问题。
    县级机关革命干部下乡前，认真学习了毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”他们来到农村，遵照毛主席的教导，老老实实地当群众的小学生，把自己放在群众之中，和社员一起抓革命，促生产。目前，在夏收第一线的广大干部、社员正以毛主席“排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，乘胜前进，为夺取“三夏”工作全胜而战斗。
