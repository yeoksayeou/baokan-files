Someone fell into a river and was about to drown. People on the shore quickly went to report to the lifeguard station, asking the lifeguards to hurry up and rescue him. At this moment, the following conversation took place: A sunburned, robust man lazily opened his eyes and asked, "What's all the fuss about?"

"A person is about to drown!"

"And what of it?"

"What do you mean, 'and what of it'? You work at the lifeguard station. Please save him!"

The lifeguard sat up on his hammock and calmly scanned the river, saying, "I can't. When I go to save him, someone might steal my oars or secretly take the boat away."

This is not a joke; it is a fact reported in a newspaper called *Lenin's Banner* in the Soviet Union.

Why did this lifeguard refuse to save the drowning person? His explanation was: We operate on an economic accounting basis.

To talk about "economic accounting" when saving lives is truly laughable. However, the director of the Moscow Oblast lifeguard station, Barinov, confidently told people, "Our work is carefully calculated. Our finances are tight, and the money people pay is little." Therefore, to make more money, the lifeguards have to engage in "side businesses" and make extra money. "They rent out boats, do underwater work, and even charge people for shooting at targets, because the lifeguard station has targets, and they charge two kopeks per shot." In other words, "economic accounting" means doing everything based on how much money is involved.

Someone asked Barinov: Does the "business" of economic accounting make lifeguards reluctant to go into the water to save people? Barinov seemed to answer without a guilty conscience, "There have been such cases. In the summer of 1965, many unfortunate incidents occurred in the reservoirs of the Moscow Oblast."

    见死不救
    有人掉进河里，快要淹死了。岸上的人赶紧去报告救生站，请救生员快去抢救。这时，发生了下面的对话：一个晒得黑黑的身体健壮的人懒洋洋地睁开眼睛问：“吵什么？”
    “一个人快要淹死啦！”
      “那又怎么样？”
    “什么怎么样？您是在救生站工作的。您救救他吧！”
    救生员在吊床上坐起来，不慌不忙地扫视了一下河水，说：“不能。我去救他的时候，有人会把我的桨拖跑，或者偷偷地把船划走”。
    这并不是笑话，这是苏联一家叫做《列宁旗帜报》上报道的事实。
    这个救生员究竟为什么见死不救呢？他的解释是：我们是实行经济核算的。
    救命还要讲“经济核算”，真是令人啼笑皆非。可是莫斯科州救生站站长巴里诺夫却振振有词地对人说道：“我们的工作是经过精心计算的。我们的经济很困难，人们付的钱又少”。因此为了多赚钱，救生员就要大搞“副业”，捞外快。“他们出租船只，从事潜水技术工作，甚至向游人收打靶的钱，因为救生站上装着靶子，射击一次收两个戈比”。一句话，所谓“经济核算”就是一切看钱多少办事。
    有人问巴里诺夫：经济核算的“营业”是否会使救生员不下水去救人呢？巴里诺夫似乎问心无愧地答道：“不是没有这种情况的。一九六五年夏天在莫斯科州的水库里就发生过许多不幸事件。”
