The British authorities in Hong Kong have decided to stand against the great seven hundred million Chinese people and the people of Hong Kong to the end. On June 8, they mobilized thousands of "riot police" to use even more brutal fascist methods to launch armed attacks on workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, killing one worker and seriously injuring dozens, arresting over five hundred people, and once again owing a blood debt to the workers and people of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

In the face of the enemy's fully armed and maddened attacks, the workers of Hong Kong showed no fear. They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and bravely fought back against the enemy's bloody suppression, fully demonstrating the workers' spirit of steel.

Xu Tianbo, a worker at the Kowloon depot of the Hong Kong British "Public Works Department," was brutally beaten to death in the Hong Kong British Yau Tsim Mong Police Station. Xu Tianbo had a deep grudge against the evil British imperialists. For over a decade, he had been actively serving his fellow workers. In the past half year, he had been diligently studying Chairman Mao's works and was an active learner of Chairman Mao's works.

At nine o'clock in the morning on June 8, when workers at the Kowloon branch of the electrical and mechanical engineering department of the Hong Kong British "Public Works Department" were holding a meeting in the factory to angrily protest against the British authorities' fascist bloody crimes and to protest against the management's tearing down of workers' big-character posters and the unreasonable dismissal of four worker representatives, the British authorities suddenly mobilized four to five hundred "riot police" to seal off the streets around the factory and launch a sudden attack on the workers inside. The "riot police" fired a large number of tear gas and poison gas bombs at the workers, and also sprayed corrosive chemicals at the workers who rushed out, causing many workers to faint from poisoning. The fascist thugs, wearing gas masks, took advantage of the smoke from the tear gas and poison gas to rush into the crowd, beating and arresting anyone they saw. According to the Hong Kong British "Information Department," a total of four hundred and fifty workers were arrested in this factory. Although the workers in this factory were in extremely unfavorable conditions, they were still full of fighting spirit and bravely fought back against the enemy. They sang, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." They sang revolutionary songs and shouted slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Protest against the British authorities' bloody suppression!" The workers picked up iron bars, sticks, tools, and other weapons to bravely defend themselves.

At the same time as the British authorities were brutally suppressing the workers at the electrical and mechanical engineering department of the Hong Kong British "Public Works Department," more than a hundred workers at the nearby China Gas Company were holding a meeting to protest against the British fascist "orders" and to protest against the British spies tearing down the workers' big-character posters. After the meeting, the workers put up even more big-character posters and slogans inside and outside the factory. Some workers climbed up the gas towers with ladders and put up large slogans on top. At around one o'clock in the afternoon, the British authorities mobilized hundreds of "riot police" to surround the two factories of this company, smash the factory gates, and fire tear gas into the factory. The fascist thugs rushed into the factory, brutally beating the workers with batons and gun butts. Many people were beaten until they were covered in blood. Some workers were even surrounded and beaten by more than ten thugs. According to the Hong Kong British radio broadcast, one hundred and twenty workers in this factory were arrested. The cowardly and brutal fascist thugs were very afraid that the British authorities' atrocities would be exposed to the world. When they were committing their crimes, they used shields to cover the windows so that reporters outside could not take photos; when reporters took photos, some thugs hurriedly used shields to cover their faces; after committing their crimes, they were afraid that the evidence of their crimes would fall into the hands of the people, so they picked up the tear gas bombs and wooden bullet heads one by one.

The British authorities' fascist atrocities were strongly condemned by the nearby residents. Workers at the nearby slaughterhouse blocked the road to the "riot cars" with pig cages, chicken cages, and miscellaneous items to prevent them from going to suppress the workers. When the fascist thugs passed by, the slaughterhouse workers threw stones and glass bottles at them. The fascist thugs fired tear gas at the slaughterhouse to provoke them, but the workers were ready for battle, forcing the fascist thugs to retreat with their tails between their legs.

At the Kowloon branch of the Hong Kong British "Waterworks Department," the British authorities sent police and spies in the early morning of June 7 to secretly tear down the big-character posters put up by the workers. The angry workers stopped work for an hour on the morning of June 8 to protest. When the workers were protesting by stopping work, the British authorities mobilized more than a hundred "riot police" to surround the factory in an attempt to suppress them. The workers bravely drove two trucks to the gate to block the road into the factory. More than three hundred workers then linked arms and held a parade and demonstration in the open space inside the factory.

The British authorities, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and the people of Hong Kong, issued a series of fascist "emergency orders" and then carried out new, large-scale fascist bloody atrocities, attempting to stop the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought and to extinguish the flames of the people of Hong Kong's anti-British struggle. The British authorities' fascist atrocities have aroused even greater indignation among the people of Hong Kong. They firmly declare: "Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned, and national dignity cannot be insulted." The enemy's atrocities have "escalated," and our anti-British struggle will also "escalate." We firmly respond to the call of our great motherland and are ready at any time to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism.

    港英当局竟向港九工人发动武装进攻并使用毒气弹  
    香港工人英勇抗击英帝血腥镇压
    坚决表示：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢，民族尊严不可侮！
    新华社香港九日电　港英当局决心与伟大的七亿中国人民和香港同胞为敌到底，六月八日又出动数以千计的“防暴队”，用更残暴的法西斯手段，向港九工人发动武装进攻，打死一名工人，重伤数十人，逮捕了五百多人，对我港九工人和同胞又欠下了一笔血债。
    香港工人在全副武装的敌人的疯狂进攻面前毫无惧色，高呼“毛主席万岁！”并且对敌人的血腥镇压进行了英勇的自卫，充分表现了工人阶级的硬骨头精神。
    港英“工务局”九龙车房工人徐田波，在野兽般的法西斯暴徒面前英勇不屈，被活活打死在港英黄大仙警署内。徐田波同万恶的英帝国主义有刻骨之仇，十多年来一贯积极为工友服务，近半年来努力学习毛主席著作，是一个学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    八日上午九时，正当港英“工务局”电器机械工程部九龙分厂的工人在厂内集会，愤怒抗议港英当局法西斯血腥暴行，并抗议厂方撕毁工人张贴的大字报和无理开除总厂四名工人代表的时候，港英当局突然出动四、五百名“防暴队”，封闭厂房附近的街道，向厂内工人发动突然袭击，“防暴队”向工人发射了大量催泪瓦斯弹和一种使人嗅到后晕倒的毒气瓦斯弹，并且向冲出来的工人疯狂地喷射腐蚀性的化学液体，当场有许多工人中毒昏倒。带上防毒面具的法西斯暴徒借着催泪瓦斯和毒气的烟幕，扑向人群，见人就打，见人就抓。据港英“新闻处”供认，在这个厂里共逮捕了四百五十名工人。这个厂的工人虽然处在极其不利的条件下，仍然斗志昂扬，向敌人进行了英勇的抗击。他们高唱：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”高唱革命歌曲，高呼口号：“毛主席万岁！”“抗议港英当局血腥镇压！”工人们拿起铁棍、木条、工具等作武器，英勇地进行自卫。
    在血腥镇压港英“工务局”电器机械工程部工人的同时，附近的中华煤气有限公司一百多名工人集会抗议港英法西斯“法令”，并抗议港英特务撕去工人张贴的大字报。会后，工人重新把更多的大字报、标语贴满厂内厂外。一些工人用梯子爬上煤气炉，把巨幅标语贴在上面。下午一时多，港英当局竟出动数百名“防暴队”，包围这个公司的两间厂房，捣毁厂房的铁门，向厂内发射催泪弹。法西斯暴徒冲进厂内，用警棍、枪托野蛮地毒打工人，许多人被打得头破血流，鲜血满面。有的工人甚至被十多个暴徒围住毒打。据港英电台广播，这个厂有一百二十名工人被逮捕。凶残而怯懦的法西斯暴徒非常害怕港英当局的暴行被公诸于世，他们在行凶的时候，用藤牌遮住窗口，不让外面的记者拍照；当记者拍照的时候，有的暴徒慌忙用藤牌遮住自己的脸；他们行凶后，害怕罪证落在同胞的手里，把催泪弹和木弹弹头逐个捡走。
    港英当局的法西斯暴行遭到附近群众的愤怒谴责。在这个公司附近的屠房工人把猪笼、鸡笼和杂物堆在路中心，阻挡“防暴车”前往镇压工人。当法西斯暴徒经过的时候，屠房工人纷纷向他们投掷石块和玻璃瓶。法西斯暴徒向屠房发射催泪弹进行挑衅，但工人严阵以待，迫使法西斯暴徒不得不夹着尾巴逃走。
    在港英“水务局”九龙分厂，港英当局七日凌晨派出警察、特务，摸黑撕去工人贴出的大字报。愤怒的工人八日上午停工一小时表示抗议。在工人停工抗议的时候，港英当局出动一百多名“防暴队”包围工厂企图镇压。工人奋勇地把两部货车开到门口堵住进厂的道路。三百多名工人接着手挽着手，在厂内空地上举行了游行示威。
    港英当局不顾我国政府和香港同胞的一再警告，在颁布了一系列法西斯“紧急法令”以后，制造了新的、大规模的法西斯血腥暴行，妄图遏阻伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，扑灭正在蓬勃兴起的香港同胞的抗英斗争怒火。港英当局的法西斯暴行已激起香港同胞更大的愤慨，他们坚决表示：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢，民族尊严不可侮。敌人的暴行已经大“升级”，我们的抗英斗争也就要大“升级”。我们坚决响应伟大祖国的号召，随时准备粉碎英帝国主义的反动统治。
