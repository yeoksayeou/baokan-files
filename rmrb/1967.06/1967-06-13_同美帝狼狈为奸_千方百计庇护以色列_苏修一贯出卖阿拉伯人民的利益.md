The Soviet revisionist leadership has consistently colluded with U.S. and British imperialism, betraying the interests of the Arab people and acting as the chief accomplice of U.S. and British imperialism.

After seizing control of the party, the government, and the military in the Soviet Union, Khrushchev began to collude with U.S. imperialism, attempting to suppress the anti-U.S. struggle of the Arab people. After Khrushchev's downfall, Brezhnev and Kosygin carried on Khrushchev's legacy, intensifying their collusion with U.S. imperialism and committing even more acts of betrayal against the Arab people.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has gone to great lengths to shield U.S. imperialism's tool of aggression in the Middle East, Israel, supporting its various acts of aggression. In April 1966, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban on further developing relations between the two countries. According to Eban, Israel was very satisfied with the " rapprochement" between the two countries. Trade between the Soviet Union and Israel has also increased significantly in recent years. In the first eleven months of 1966, the total value of goods imported from Israel by the Soviet Union was four times that of the same period in 1965. Moreover, the Soviet revisionist leadership has consistently sent large numbers of Soviet Jews to Israel. In December 1966, during Kosygin's visit to Paris, he publicly announced the lifting of restrictions on the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. Statistics show that in the past ten years, out of the more than 400,000 Jews who have emigrated to Israel, the majority have come from the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. A Palestinian friend pointed out bluntly: "In Israel, the U.S. provides the guns, the Soviet Union provides the people, and the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Israel are partners against the Palestinian people."

In collusion with U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership has repeatedly played the game of so-called Arab-Israeli "reconciliation," aiming to make the Arab people tolerate Israeli aggression and force them to surrender to Israel. To this end, the Soviet revisionist leadership has, since the beginning of last year, peddled the so-called "Tashkent spirit," advocating "peaceful coexistence" between the Arab people and Israel. The Soviet magazine *Novy Mir* has talked at length about how "Vietnam and Tashkent symbolize the two diametrically opposed policies in international affairs at present," believing that the "Tashkent policy" is the one that "serves the interests of humanity." It even openly proposed that Israel and Arab countries have equal rights in the matter of the Jordan River water. The Soviet ambassador to Israel publicly advocated stopping the Arab people from arming themselves in March 1966, attempting to make them lay down their weapons. Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol once wrote a special letter to Kosygin, expressing his joy that he hoped the "Tashkent spirit" would be developed in the Middle East. He said, "Israel and the Soviet Union have common views on many issues, and I hope that friendly relations between the two countries will be strengthened."

At international conferences, Soviet revisionist representatives have consistently refused to support the struggle of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland. For example, at the beginning of this year, at the illegal "Eighth Conference of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council" held in Nicosia and the pseudo "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" held in Beirut, the Soviet revisionist delegation not only did not condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and Israel but also vigorously obstructed the passage of resolutions supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people. The Soviet revisionist leadership refused to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization and rejected the organization's request to set up an office in Moscow. This further exposed the Soviet revisionists' shameful role as accomplices of U.S. imperialism, betraying the interests of the Arab people. The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shukairy, once said: Some countries claim to be socialist countries, but at the same time, they support, recognize, and collude with Israel. They are not true socialist countries.

After Israel's sudden attack on Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leadership played a trick of false support and true betrayal, colluding with U.S. and British imperialism to not only plot a "ceasefire resolution," openly betraying the Arab people, but also playing various political tricks, deceiving the Arab people, and attempting to achieve the despicable goal of Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the Arab world.

    同美帝狼狈为奸　千方百计庇护以色列
    苏修一贯出卖阿拉伯人民的利益
    据新华社十二日讯  苏联修正主义领导集团一贯同美英帝国主义狼狈为奸，出卖阿拉伯人民利益，充当美英帝国主义头号帮凶的角色。
    赫鲁晓夫在苏联篡党、篡政、篡军以后，就同美帝国主义勾勾搭搭，妄图遏制阿拉伯人民的反美斗争怒潮。赫鲁晓夫垮台以后，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流秉承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，加紧勾结美帝国主义，干出了更多的叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的坏事。
    苏修领导集团千方百计地庇护美帝国主义在中东的侵略工具以色列，支持它的种种侵略活动。一九六六年四月，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同以色列外交部长阿巴·埃班又就双方进一步发展关系的问题举行了会谈。据阿巴·埃班透露，以色列对于苏以双方的“接近”表示很满意。苏联和以色列的贸易近年来也有很大增长。一九六六年头十一个月，苏联从以色列进口的商品总额相当于一九六五年同期四倍。不仅如此，苏修领导集团还一直把大批苏联的犹太人移居到以色列去。苏修头目柯西金一九六六年十二月访问巴黎时，公开发表了关于取消对苏联的犹太人向以色列迁移的限制的声明。据统计，在最近十年里，迁居到以色列的四十多万犹太人中，主要是来自苏联和某些东欧国家。一位巴勒斯坦朋友一针见血地指出：“在以色列，美国出枪，苏联出人，美国、苏联、以色列合伙同巴勒斯坦人民为敌。”
    苏修领导集团配合美帝国主义不断玩弄所谓阿拉伯—以色列“和解”的阴谋，其目的就是要阿拉伯人民容忍以色列的侵略，并迫使阿拉伯人民向以色列屈膝投降。为此，苏修领导集团从去年年初起，大肆贩卖所谓“塔什干精神”，鼓吹什么阿拉伯人民和以色列之间的“和平共处”。苏联《新时代》杂志大谈什么“越南和塔什干象征着国际事务中目前两个截然相反的方针”，认为“塔什干方针”才“符合人类利益”，它并公然提出在约旦河水问题上以色列同阿拉伯国家有同等权利。苏联驻以色列大使一九六六年三月公开鼓吹制止阿拉伯人民武装自己，企图使他们放下武器。以色列总理艾希科尔曾经特别写信给柯西金，他在信中欢欣鼓舞地表示，他希望“塔什干精神”将能在中东得到发展。他说：“以色列和苏联对许多问题有共同的态度，希望两国之间的友好关系将能加强”。
    苏修代表在国际会议上，一贯拒绝支持巴勒斯坦人民争取重返家园的斗争。例如今年初在尼科西亚非法召开的“第八届亚非团结理事会会议”和在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”上，苏修代表团不仅不谴责美帝国主义和以色列的侵略罪行，而且竭力阻挠通过支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争的决议。苏联修正主义领导集团拒绝承认巴勒斯坦解放组织，拒绝解放组织在莫斯科设立办事处的要求。这就使巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民更加认清了苏修充当美帝帮凶，出卖阿拉伯人民利益的可耻面目。巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里曾经说：一些国家自称为社会主义国家，但同时却支持、承认和勾结以色列，它们不是真正的社会主义国家。
    以色列悍然发动对阿拉伯国家的突然袭击后，苏修领导集团施展假支持、真出卖的阴谋，同美、英帝国主义串通一气，不仅策划“停火决议”，公开出卖阿拉伯人民，而且玩弄种种政治圈套，欺骗阿拉伯人民，妄图达到苏美合作主宰阿拉伯世界的卑鄙目的。
