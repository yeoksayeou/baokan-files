New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox hailed the victory of Mao Zedong Thought
China's Hydrogen Bomb Explosion is an Achievement of the Cultural Revolution and Powerfully Shatters the Nuclear Monopoly of U.S. Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism

	New Zealand, Wellington, June 20 -- New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox issued a statement today celebrating China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb. The statement said, "This great achievement is a hymn to Mao Zedong Thought and a powerful testament to the might of Mao Zedong Thought."

	The statement pointed out, "The successful detonation of China's hydrogen bomb has shattered the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union, and it cannot but cause great rejoicing among the oppressed and exploited people around the world."

	The statement said: "This is a signal that the vigorous development of the Cultural Revolution has led to tremendous advancements in science and production, and at the same time, it has refuted all the nonsense propagated by the West about China being in a state of chaos.

	"This is a signal that under the guidance, inspiration, and encouragement of Chairman Mao, the broad masses of the Chinese people are determined to make China an impregnable socialist fortress forever, and a fortress of the international proletariat and the national liberation movement."

	The statement pointed out: "China's nuclear advancements have greatly strengthened the forces of peace and the masses fighting against imperialism. The heroic struggle of the anti-imperialist masses is an obstacle to the unlimited aggression of the United States in Vietnam and other regions."

	The statement said: "China has once again reiterated that it does not intend to be the first to use atomic weapons and is willing to work for the complete elimination of atomic weapons, which shows that China's development of nuclear power is purely for defensive purposes. This stands in stark contrast to the policy of nuclear blackmail and aggression pursued by U.S. imperialism, and it thoroughly refutes the slanders against China by Washington and Moscow."

	The statement congratulated China on this great achievement and believed that this achievement is a powerful rebuke to the aggressive forces led by U.S. imperialism, which are trying to plunge the people into a new world war. The statement emphasized, "China's hydrogen bomb is a true deterrent to such forces. It is also a call to the people to unite and make new efforts to stop the aggressors and truly eliminate the danger of war by overthrowing the imperialist system that produces the danger of war."

    新共总书记威尔科克斯欢呼毛泽东思想的胜利
    中国氢弹爆炸是文化大革命的成就  有力粉碎了美帝苏修的核垄断地位
    新华社惠灵顿二十日电　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯同志二十日发表声明，欢呼中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功。声明说，“这一巨大成就，是对毛泽东思想的一曲颂歌，也是毛泽东思想巨大威力的证明。”
    声明指出，“中国的氢弹爆炸成功打破了美苏核垄断地位，它不能不在全世界被压迫者和被剥削者中间引起巨大的欢腾。”
    声明说：“这是一个信号，表明文化革命的蓬勃发展已经导致了科学和生产的强大进展，同时也一笔勾销了西方宣传关于中国处于混乱状态的一切奇谈怪论。
    “这是一个信号，表明在毛主席教导、启发和鼓舞下的中国广大群众，决心使中国永远成为不可攻破的社会主义堡垒，成为国际工人阶级和民族解放运动的堡垒。”
    声明指出：“中国的核进展大大加强了和平的力量和那些反对帝国主义的群众的力量。反帝的群众力量的英勇斗争是对美国在越南和其他地区进行无限制侵略的障碍。”
    声明说：“中国再次重申决不打算首先使用原子武器并且愿为原子武器的彻底销毁作出努力，这表明中国发展核力量完全是为了防御的目的。这同美帝国主义所推行的核讹诈侵略政策形成了最鲜明的对照，同时也彻底驳倒了华盛顿和莫斯科诬蔑中国的谰言。”
    声明对中国的这一巨大成就表示祝贺，并且认为这一成就是对以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力的一次有力回击，这些侵略势力正力图把人民投入一场新的世界大战。声明强调说，“中国的氢弹是对这种势力的真正遏制。它也是向人民发出的一个团结的号召，号召他们作出新的努力来制止侵略者，并且通过推翻产生战争危险的帝国主义制度来真正消除战争的危险。”
