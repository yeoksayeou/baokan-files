	Ready to Crush British Imperialist Rule with Hong Kong Compatriots
	Guangzhou: 100,000 People Rally to Denounce the Fascist Atrocities of the Hong Kong British Authorities

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 6th: Tonight, nearly 100,000 revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary journalists in Guangzhou held a grand rally to strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities.

	The revolutionary masses of the Guangzhou region, in support of the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, decided to start from the 6th and hold extensive activities for ten consecutive days to denounce the crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in suppressing the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.

	The meeting was held at the Yuexiu Mountain People's Stadium. The revolutionary masses were indignant, and the slogans "Resolutely fight and defeat British imperialism," "British imperialism must bow and apologize," and "Anti-imperialism is justified, resisting violence is not a crime" echoed through the air.

	The presider of the meeting said in his speech: For more than a hundred years, the reactionary and decadent British imperialism has done countless evil deeds on our sacred territory of Hong Kong, with blood debts piled high and crimes beyond measure. This old account has not yet been settled, and British imperialism has once again committed large-scale fascist atrocities in suppressing our compatriots in Hong Kong. We resolutely respond to the mobilization order issued by the People's Daily on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to resist the British and suppress violence, and together with the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, demand blood debt from British imperialism, and are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

	The worker representative said in his speech: We warmly praise the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong for their fearlessness and self-sacrifice in bravely and tenaciously fighting against British imperialism. He said, the Chinese working class has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies. In the past, the Hong Kong-Guangdong strike dealt a heavy blow to British imperialism politically and economically, making Hong Kong a stinking, dead, and starving port, and British imperialism ended in failure. He sternly warned British imperialism not to think that a few broken batons, a few broken warships, a few black prisons, and a few reactionary "orders" can intimidate the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the Chinese people.

	The representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants from the suburbs of Guangzhou said in his speech: The revolutionary peasants of the suburbs of Guangzhou, who have a glorious tradition of fighting against British imperialism, have long since confronted British imperialism. More than a hundred years ago, we could defeat the fully armed British imperialists with our big knives and axes. Now, we poor and lower-middle peasants are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are invincible. If British imperialism does not bow and apologize, it will have no way out but to perish.

	The Red Guards said in their speech: We strongly condemn British imperialism for always following American imperialism, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and madly opposing the great Chinese people. He said, we Red Guards are determined to rebel against imperialism, against revisionism, and against all reactionaries. In our generation, we will personally bury imperialism and sweep away all harmful elements.

	Representatives from the People's Liberation Army, government officials, and the press also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out: With the full support of 700 million people of the motherland, especially with the resolute struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong who have formed a mighty revolutionary force, British imperialism will surely be defeated and crushed.

	The meeting finally passed a protest telegram to the Hong Kong British authorities and a message of solidarity to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.

	After the meeting, a demonstration march was held.

    随时准备和香港同胞一起粉碎英帝反动统治
    广州十万人集会声讨港英当局法西斯暴行
    据新华社广州六日电  广州市今晚又有近十万名革命工人、贫下中农、革命师生、革命干部和革命的新闻工作者举行声势浩大的集会，强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行。
    广州地区的广大革命群众，为了支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争，决定从六日起，连续十天深入广泛地举行各种声讨港英当局镇压香港爱国同胞的罪行的活动。
    今天的大会在越秀山人民体育场举行。广大革命群众义愤填膺，“坚决把英帝斗垮、斗臭”“英帝国主义必须低头认罪”“反帝有理，抗暴无罪”的口号此起彼伏。
    大会主持人在讲话中说，一百多年来，反动腐朽的英帝国主义在我国神圣领土香港干尽了坏事，血债累累，罪恶滔天。这笔旧账还未清算，英帝国主义又接连制造了大规模镇压我香港同胞的法西斯暴行。我们坚决响应《人民日报》代表毛主席和党中央发出的反英抗暴的动员令，同香港爱国同胞一道，向英帝国主义讨还血债，随时准备响应祖国号召，彻底粉碎英帝在香港的反动统治。
    革命工人代表在讲话中热烈赞扬香港爱国同胞不畏强暴、不怕牺牲，同英帝国主义进行英勇顽强的斗争。他说，我们中国工人阶级有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，过去省港大罢工曾给英帝国主义在政治上、经济上以沉重打击，使香港变成臭港、死港、饿港，英帝国主义以失败而告终。他严正警告英帝国主义，休想用几根破警棍，几条破军舰，几座黑监狱，几道反动“法令”，就可以把港九爱国同胞和中国人民吓倒。
    广州郊区贫下中农代表在讲话中说，具有反英帝国主义斗争光荣传统的广州郊区革命农民，早就同英帝国主义较量过，一百多年以前我们手持大刀、斧头也能战胜全副武装的英帝国主义。现在，我们贫下中农是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，更是不可战胜的，如果英帝国主义不低头认罪，只有死路一条。
    红卫兵小将在讲话中强烈谴责英帝国主义一直追随美帝国主义，勾结蒋介石匪帮，疯狂地与伟大的中国人民为敌。他说，我们红卫兵小将就是要大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反。在我们这一代一定要亲手埋葬帝国主义，扫除一切害人虫。
    解放军战士、机关干部和新闻界代表也在会上讲话，他们一致指出：在祖国七亿人民的全力支持下，特别是在结成了浩浩荡荡革命队伍的香港爱国同胞的坚决斗争下，英帝国主义必将碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨。
    大会最后通过了给港英当局的抗议电和给香港爱国同胞的慰问电。
    大会结束后举行了示威游行。
