	Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, eight Chinese red diplomats who bravely defended the dignity of our national flag and were severely beaten by mobs instigated by the Indian reactionary government, along with personnel from the Chinese Embassy in India who came to see them off at the airport, engaged in an extremely heroic struggle with the Indian reactionary government on the morning of June 24 at the Delhi airport. They finally foiled the Indian reactionary government's plot to obstruct the return of the injured personnel to China for treatment and triumphantly boarded a Nepal Airlines flight to leave Delhi via Kathmandu and return home.

	This is another major victory in the unyielding struggle of our red diplomats, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, against the Indian reactionaries' schemes to persecute Chinese diplomatic personnel.

	On the morning of June 24, the Indian reactionary government once again persecuted the Chinese embassy personnel who were injured by Indian mobs and were preparing to board a flight to return to China for treatment.

	The eight injured Chinese diplomats and the Chinese embassy personnel who came to see them off arrived at the Delhi airport at 9:20 AM. The Deputy Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in India and the Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan in India also went to the airport to see them off.

	However, the Indian reactionary government dispatched several hundred police and secret agents to seal off the airport. They did not allow the Pakistani Deputy High Commissioner to enter the airport and surrounded the injured personnel and the send-off team from the Chinese embassy. As soon as the injured First Secretary Chen Luzhi stepped out of the car, he was immediately forcibly taken away by forty or fifty police officers, separating him from the other injured personnel and the send-off team. The Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese embassy, Chen Zhaoyuan, also had his left leg kicked and injured. After Chen Luzhi was taken away, he glared at the police and secret agents who seized him, shouting slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" The Indian police and secret agents took Chen Luzhi to a small room, where officials from the "Foreigners Registration Office" and Indian police tried to force him to sign a document, but Chen Luzhi firmly refused and protested. An Indian official said, "If you don't sign, we will." After the Indian official signed, he held the document and tried to take a picture of Chen Luzhi next to it, but Chen Luzhi refused again. Chen Luzhi turned his back to the camera, foiling their plot. The Indian police then took Chen Luzhi to the customs, demanding that he sign the customs declaration form. Chen Luzhi refused again, shouting slogans and protesting. The Indian side's plot failed once more. They then wanted to check Chen Luzhi's luggage and forcibly took his briefcase to inspect it. Chen Luzhi protested again. Subsequently, a group of Indian police surrounded Chen Luzhi and escorted him onto the plane. Chen Luzhi held his head high and shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" "Down with the lackeys of the U.S. and the Soviet Union!" along the way, and lodged the strongest protest against the Indian side. After Chen Luzhi boarded the plane, an officer sat next to him to guard him until the other injured personnel and passengers from the Chinese embassy boarded. At that time, there was a person filming on the plane who wanted to take a picture, and Chen Luzhi held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" towards the camera and shouted slogans.

	The other injured personnel were also treated very brutally by the Indian police at the airport. They were first surrounded by Indian police and blocked outside the waiting room. The Indian police pushed them around at will, and a female Indian police officer and two female police officers grabbed the arms of one of our female staff members, preventing her from moving. The Indian police also snatched the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the injured person Shen Ganbei's pocket, and only allowed them to enter the waiting room one by one twenty minutes later. Before boarding the plane, the Indian side forcibly inspected their luggage again.

	However, the Chinese red diplomats armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Facing hundreds of Indian police and secret agents, the injured personnel and the send-off team from the Chinese embassy were fearless. They waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The loud slogans and recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations completely drowned out the arrogant atmosphere of the hundreds of Indian reactionary government officials, police, and secret agents at the airport.

	After a heroic struggle, the eight injured Chinese red diplomats finally boarded the plane and left Delhi for Kathmandu at 10:50 AM. The Chinese diplomats armed with Mao Zedong Thought fought a series of heroic and unyielding battles against the Indian reactionary government, causing one plot after another of the Indian reactionary government during the anti-China frenzy to fail completely.

	After seeing off the injured personnel returning home, Acting Charge d'Affaires Chen Zhaoyuan immediately went to the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge the strongest protest against the Indian government's attempt to seize our diplomats, brutally and rudely treat our injured personnel, and infringe upon the personal safety of our Acting Charge d'Affaires.

	KATHMANDU, June 24 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Embassy's First Secretary Chen Luzhi and seven other red diplomats who were persecuted by the Indian reactionary government and injured by mobs instigated by the Indian reactionary government arrived in Kathmandu at 1:00 PM on June 24, from where they will return home.

	Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Yang Gongsu and staff from the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, Xinhua News Agency's Kathmandu branch, Chinese experts supporting various construction projects in Nepal, the Chinese Art Troupe, and 160-70 overseas Chinese residing in Nepal welcomed them at the airport.

	The eight red diplomats, holding Chairman Mao's portrait and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stepped off the plane. They angrily shouted, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!"

	The welcoming Chinese personnel held up the great portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader, the great supreme commander, and the great helmsman, and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts forever!" "Warmest welcome to the red diplomats who have been persecuted by the Indian reactionaries!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" They also presented flowers to the eight red diplomats to express their respect.

	The eight red diplomats sang "The East Is Red" and read Chairman Mao's quotations with their fellow Chinese in Nepal.

	The President of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, Purna Bahadur, the Chairman of the Nepal-China Cultural Association, Pradan, members of these two associations, and many Nepalese friends also went to the airport to welcome them.

	Pakistani Ambassador to Nepal Abbas, officials from the Pakistani Embassy in Nepal, and a representative from the Pakistani News Agency also went to the airport to welcome them.

	The Chinese Embassy held a welcome ceremony in the afternoon of June 24 to welcome the eight red diplomats who had fought bravely against the Indian reactionaries.

    粉碎印度反动派武力劫持和蛮横阻挠的反华阴谋
    我八位红色外交战士英勇斗争胜利回国
    他们在归国途中到加德满都时受到我驻尼使馆人员等热烈欢迎
    新华社二十五日讯　新德里消息：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为英勇保卫我国国旗的尊严被印度反动政府唆使暴徒殴打重伤的八名中国红色外交战士和中国驻印大使馆到机场欢送的人员，二十四日上午在德里机场同印度反动政府进行了极其英勇的斗争，终于挫败了印度反动政府企图阻挠被印度暴徒打伤人员回国治疗的阴谋，胜利地乘上尼泊尔班机离开新德里取道加德满都回国。
    这是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的我国红色外交战士，同印度反动派迫害中国外交人员的阴谋伎俩进行不屈不挠的斗争中的又一次重大的胜利。
    二十四日上午，印度反动政府在德里机场上对被印度暴徒打伤、准备乘班机离印回国治疗的中国大使馆人员，又一次进行了政治迫害。
    中国受伤的八名外交战士及中国大使馆送行人员在九时二十分到达德里机场。越南民主共和国驻印代总领事和巴基斯坦驻印副高级专员也去机场欢送。
    但是印度反动政府出动了几百名警察、特务封锁了机场，他们不让巴基斯坦副高级专员进入机场，并包围了中国大使馆的伤员和送行人员。受伤的一等秘书陈鲁直一下汽车，就立即被四、五十名警察强行架走，与其他伤员及送行人员隔断。中国大使馆临时代办陈肇源左腿也被踢破。陈鲁直被架走后，横眉冷对劫持他的警察、特务，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒印度反动派！”等口号。印度警察和特务把陈鲁直带到一个小房间，在那里，“外国人登记处”的官员和印度警察企图强迫他在一份文件上签字，但被陈鲁直严词拒绝，并提出抗议。一名印方人员说，如果你不签，我们签。印方人员签字后竟手持文件要陈鲁直在旁边照像，又遭陈鲁直拒绝。陈鲁直背向照相机，使这个阴谋遭到破产。一计不成又生一计，印度警察把陈鲁直押到海关，要他在海关手续卡片上签字。陈鲁直再次拒绝，并高呼口号，提出抗议。印方的阴谋又没有得逞。他们紧接着要检查陈鲁直的行李，强行抢走他手上的皮包进行检查。陈鲁直就此再次向印方提出抗议。随后，一批印警将陈鲁直包围起来押着他上飞机，陈鲁直昂首挺胸，一路高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒印度反动派！”“打倒美苏走狗！”等口号，并向印方提出最强烈抗议。陈鲁直上机后，一名警官坐在他旁边监押他，直到中国大使馆其他伤员和旅客上来后才离开。当时有一名拍电影的在机上要拍照，陈鲁直就对着镜头高举《毛主席语录》，高呼口号。
    其他伤员在机场也受到印度警察极为野蛮粗暴的对待。他们先是被印警包围，被堵在候机室门外。印警对他们任意推挤，一名印女警官和两名女警察捉住我一位女工作人员的手臂不许她走动。印警还抢走了伤员沈干北衣袋中的《毛主席语录》，二十分钟后才将他们逐个放行入候机室。在登上飞机前，印方又强行检查他们的行李。
    但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国红色外交战士是不可侮的。面对着几百名印度警察、特务，中国伤员和中国大使馆送行人员无所畏惧，他们在告别时挥动《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒印度反动派！”等口号，并一起背诵毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”响亮的口号声、背诵毛主席语录声完全压倒了机场上数百名外强中干的印度反动政府官员和警察、特务的嚣张气焰。
    经过一场英勇的斗争，中国八名受伤的红色外交战士终于全部胜利地登上飞机，在十时五十分离开新德里飞赴加德满都。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国外交战士向印度反动政府进行了一系列英勇的针锋相对的斗争，终于使印度反动政府在掀起反华高潮中玩弄的阴谋，一个又一个地遭到彻底破产。
    中国大使馆临时代办陈肇源在送别回国的伤员以后，立即到印度外交部就印度政府企图劫持我外交官、野蛮粗暴对待我负伤人员，侵犯我临时代办人身安全等行为，向印度政府提出了最强烈抗议。
    新华社加德满都二十四日电　遭受印度反动政府迫害和被印度反动政府唆使暴徒打伤的中国驻印度大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直及其他七名外交战士，二十四日下午一时从新德里到达加德满都，由这里取道回国。
    中国驻尼泊尔大使杨公素和中国驻尼泊尔大使馆工作人员、新华社加德满都分社工作人员、支援尼泊尔建设各项工程的中国专家、中国艺术团和旅居尼泊尔的华侨一百六、七十人到机场热烈欢迎他们。
    这八位红色外交战士拿着毛主席像和红书《毛主席语录》走下飞机。他们愤怒高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联修正主义！”“打倒印度反动派！”
    前来欢迎的中国人员高举伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的巨幅画像和红书《毛主席语录》，欢迎者高呼口号：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”“最热烈地欢迎受印度反动派迫害的红色外交战士！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎！”他们还向八位红色外交战士献花，表示对他们的敬意。
    八位红色外交战士同在尼泊尔的中国同志一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，一起朗读毛主席语录。
    尼中友好协会会长普尔纳·巴哈杜尔、尼中文化协会主席普拉丹、这两个协会的会员和许多尼泊尔朋友也到机场欢迎。
    巴基斯坦驻尼泊尔大使阿巴斯、巴基斯坦驻尼泊尔大使馆官员和巴基斯坦报联社代表也到机场欢迎。
    中国大使馆二十四日下午举行欢迎会来欢迎同印度反动派英勇斗争的八位红色外交战士。
