Arab armies continue to bravely resist the Israeli aggressors, who are backed by American and British air forces, on various fronts on June 7.

The United Arab Republic (UAR) forces fought valiantly against the Israeli invaders. The UAR Armed Forces High Command issued a statement in the afternoon of June 7, announcing that under continuous air raids involving American and British aircraft, UAR forces had voluntarily withdrawn from some frontline positions and were now fiercely battling the enemy on the second line. The statement said that on the morning of June 7, UAR forces shot down eight enemy planes attacking their positions in the Sinai region.

On the Syrian-Israeli front, Syrian forces that had advanced into northern Israel were pursuing Israeli troops retreating towards Nazareth across the Hula Plain. Meanwhile, Syrian artillery continued to shell Israeli positions from the heights along the Jordan River, destroying an Israeli infantry company, demolishing several enemy strongholds, and destroying more than a dozen tanks and armored personnel carriers. In an aerial battle, the Syrian Air Force shot down two invading Israeli jet fighters and captured one pilot.

The Syrian Ministry of Defense issued a statement on June 7, strongly condemning American imperialism for openly dispatching Canberra-style jet bombers to bomb Syrian frontline positions, thereby "exposing its imperialist deceitful face."

According to a broadcast by Damascus Radio on June 7, the command of the Palestinian "Storm" commando units reported that after the Israeli aggression, Palestinian commandos had intensified their armed activities within the Israeli-occupied areas, attacking Israeli patrols and police stations, and blowing up railway bridges, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

The Iraqi Air Force, participating in the Arab front, continued to dispatch aircraft to bomb northern Israeli coastal areas. According to a broadcast by Baghdad Radio on June 7, since the start of the war, Iraqi aircraft had conducted fifty air raids on Tel Aviv in Israel. The Iraqi military announced that on June 7, when Israeli fighter-bombers attacked an Iraqi airbase in Jordanian territory, they were shot down by Iraqi air forces and anti-aircraft artillery, with all pilots captured.

According to a broadcast by Amman Radio on June 6, Jordanian soldiers were engaged in fierce battles against enemy forces three times their number in Jerusalem and Jenin. Amidst the intense fighting on the Middle East front, Algeria announced at noon on June 7 that a new squadron of Algerian jet fighters had arrived in Cairo to join the war against imperialist and Zionist aggression.
