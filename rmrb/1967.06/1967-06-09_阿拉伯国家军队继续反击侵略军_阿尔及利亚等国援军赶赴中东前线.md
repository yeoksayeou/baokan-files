Arab countries' armies continued to counterattack the invading forces supported by American and British imperialism on June 8.

Fighting was particularly intense in the central desert region of the Sinai Peninsula in the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR's armored units, with air support, launched a fierce counterattack on June 8 against Israeli invaders who had advanced to Bir Qafqa and Mitla Pass. The Israeli side admitted that the UAR's counterattack was exceptionally fierce, and the battle is still ongoing.

In the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula at Sharm al-Sheikh, local UAR defenders, after shooting down seven Israeli planes and annihilating a large number of parachuted Israeli troops, voluntarily withdrew from this strategic fortress at the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba.

After a new squadron of jet fighters from Algeria arrived in the UAR, Israeli planes resumed air raids on areas near Cairo and the Suez Canal on June 8. The UAR's air force and ground artillery fiercely retaliated, shooting down nine enemy planes. In the skies over the Suez Canal, the UAR's air force also intercepted three British Canberra bombers escorted by Israeli jet fighters, shooting down two enemy planes in the aerial combat.

According to a report from Cairo Radio on June 8, the UAR side discovered three American planes flying from north to south along the Suez Canal, "obviously conducting reconnaissance."

On the Syrian front, the Damascus Radio announced that Syrian forces broke through and entered the northern border of Israel on June 7, advancing towards Safad. Syria launched heavy artillery attacks on Israeli positions north of the Sea of Galilee on June 8.

Reinforcements from Arab countries continued to arrive at the Middle East front. According to reports, Algerian forces that rushed to support the UAR have been deployed east of the Suez Canal and have entered the front line for the first time. Additionally, the first batch of Moroccan support troops has been flown to the UAR. The first batch of Sudanese troops also departed from Khartoum for the UAR on June 7.

    阿尔及利亚等国援军赶赴中东前线
    据新华社开罗八日电  阿拉伯国家八日继续与美、英帝国主义支持的以色列侵略军激战。
    在阿联的西奈半岛中部沙漠地区战斗特别激烈。阿联装甲部队在空军的支援下，八日向窜到比尔卡夫卡法和米特拉山的以色列侵略军发起猛烈反击。以色列方面承认，阿联军队的反击异常猛烈，激战还在进行。
    在西奈半岛南端的沙姆沙伊赫，当地的阿联守军在击落了七架以色列飞机和歼灭了大批空降的以色列伞兵以后，主动撤出了这个亚喀巴湾入口处的要塞。
    在阿尔及利亚支援的新的喷气战斗机队飞抵阿联后，以色列飞机八日又恢复对开罗附近和运河区的空袭，阿联空军和地面炮火猛予回击，击落敌机九架。在运河区上空，阿联空军还截击了给三架英国坎培拉式轰炸机护航的以色列喷气战斗机，在空战中击落敌机两架。
    据开罗电台八日报道，阿联方面发现有三架美国飞机从北到南沿苏伊士运河上空飞行，“显然是进行侦察”。
    在叙利亚战线方面，据大马士革电台宣布，叙利亚部队七日突破并进入以色列北部边境，并朝萨法德挺进。叙利亚八日猛烈炮轰加利里海北面的以色列阵地。
    赶到中东前线增援的阿拉伯国家军队陆续不绝。据报道，赶到阿联支援的阿尔及利亚部队，已经部署在苏伊士运河以东，并在前线首次投入战斗。另外，第一批摩洛哥支援部队已经由飞机赶运到阿联。苏丹首批部队也在七日离开喀土穆前往阿联。
