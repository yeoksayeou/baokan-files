The stage of Chinese arts and literature, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will witness a springtime of a hundred flowers in full bloom. Promote the revolutionary model operas nationwide.

The eight revolutionary model operas, which were staged in Beijing to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," have concluded successfully. These operas include the Beijing operas "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Shajiabang," "On the Dock," and "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," the ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," and the symphonic music "Shajiabang." They have been enthusiastically received by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This performance event, which lasted 37 days and staged 218 performances, welcomed nearly 330,000 spectators. It was a grand gathering to uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, showcasing the achievements of the drama revolution, and a grand celebration of the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. It was an unprecedented grand event on the cultural stage of the capital. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously praised these eight revolutionary model operas as brilliant gems of art that shine with the resplendent light of great Mao Zedong Thought.

The eight revolutionary model operas performed in this event prominently propagated the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and prominently sang the praises of the historical masters—the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are permeated with Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. They embody the correct policies of "letting a hundred flowers blossom," "pushing the old to make way for the new," "using the past to serve the present," and "using foreign things to serve China." They have achieved the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible, becoming powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

In the present day, when the news of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is resounding, the performance of the eight revolutionary model operas in Beijing is a major event in the history of revolutionary literature and art. The success of this performance has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampened the spirit of the bourgeoisie. In the past, the clique of anti-revolutionary revisionists led by Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan, with the support of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, frantically promoted the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, opposed the revolution in literature and art, and used literature and art as a tool for restoring capitalism. However, the wings of a crow cannot block the sun. Under the leadership of the bravest warriors of the proletarian cultural revolution, Comrade Jiang Qing, a group of young "little people" in the literary and artistic circles have emerged. They have raised high the great banner of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and launched a massive attack on the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. After more than three years of arduous struggle, they have finally created eight revolutionary model operas that shine with the resplendent light of Mao Zedong Thought. These revolutionary model operas have, for the first time in history, successfully portrayed the towering images of the historical masters—the workers, peasants, and soldiers—on the stage, reversing the history that was once overturned by the exploited classes. This marks the end of the era when emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, foreigners, and landlords dominated the stage, and the beginning of a new era of proletarian literature and art, signifying the failure of the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and the start of a new epoch in proletarian revolutionary literature and art. This is a brilliant new chapter in the history of proletarian revolutionary literature and art.

The eight revolutionary model operas performed on the stage of the capital have been highly praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who have enthusiastically acclaimed them. They praise them for setting a brilliant example for the development of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. They acclaim them as glorious achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and as great victories of Mao Zedong Thought! Every worker, peasant, and soldier who has seen the revolutionary model operas is filled with joy and excitement. They say, "These revolutionary model operas, from beginning to end, sing the praises of the brilliant thoughts and proletarian revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao, and of the workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who have lofty ideals and a broad mind. They have given us a profound education and inspiration, and they make us love our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, even more. We love to watch such revolutionary model operas; even if there were a thousand or ten thousand of them, we would never get tired of watching them; even if we watched them a thousand or ten thousand times, we would never get enough of them!" After watching the revolutionary model operas, some workers and peasants proudly said, "The model operas are great! They sing to our hearts, the hearts of workers and peasants, and they speak to our hearts, the hearts of workers and peasants. These are truly our operas, the operas of workers and peasants."

Some also said, "In the past, when we watched operas, we saw emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, which were disgusting; now, when we watch operas, we see the historical masters—the workers and peasants—which are wonderful; in the past, when we watched old operas, the more we listened, the more confused we became; now, when we watch revolutionary model operas, we understand as soon as we listen; in the past, when we watched old operas, our spirits were oppressed, and our wills were weakened; now, after watching revolutionary model operas, our spirits are invigorated, and our strength is boundless." During the performances, the towering images of workers and peasants on the stage constantly evoked strong responses from the workers and peasants in the audience. Many people, with tears of excitement in their eyes, could not help but applaud repeatedly, expressing the deep love of the broad masses of workers and peasants for the revolutionary model operas and their admiration for the revolutionary literary and artistic workers who have successfully portrayed the brilliant and towering images of workers and peasants.

International friends who watched the revolutionary model operas could not contain their joy. They said passionately, "The path you are opening up is the path that revolutionary literature and art around the world will follow. Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic direction is the direction for revolutionary literature and art around the world." At a time when imperialist and modern revisionist culture is heading towards decay and decline, on the socialist literary and artistic stage of China, the radiant images of the historical masters—the heroic figures of workers and peasants—stand tall and proud. It has opened up a new era of proletarian literature and art and is a model for international proletarian revolutionary literature and art. Some foreign guests, after watching the performance, could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

This performance has given great encouragement and impetus to revolutionary literary and artistic workers. They feel that in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and on the glorious anniversary of the 25th publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," they have had the opportunity to perform revolutionary model operas in the capital. This is the boundless concern and trust of Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country for them. To perform the revolutionary model operas better, they study Chairman Mao's "Talks" and the five recently published documents on literature and art over and over again, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide their artistic practice, and using the spirit of Norman Bethune's pursuit of excellence in technical work to encourage themselves to perform well. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers say: We are not performing for the sake of performing, but we are fighting, battling, serving the proletarian dictatorship, and seizing the stage for the workers and peasants. Every performance is a heavy artillery shell fired at capitalist, feudal, and revisionist literature and art, a sharp sword aimed at the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and a thunderous roar that strikes the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line to death. We will forever be loyal soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic army, fighting under the command of Comrade Jiang Qing, drumming, shouting, fighting, and advancing bravely to fully and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line! They all expressed that in the future, they will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of "Talks," go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and work hard to change their worldview, achieve ideological transformation, vigorously promote the revolution, and vigorously promote production. They will not be satisfied with the achievements they have made and are determined to create more, better, and higher revolutionary models in the field of literature and art, so that the garden of proletarian literature and art will be covered with fragrant grass and blooming flowers.

In the process of jointly performing the revolutionary model operas, revolutionary literary and artistic workers have deeply felt that they have the common task of propagating the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the common task of thoroughly overthrowing, criticizing, and exposing the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line backed by him, and completing the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. They should unite on the premise of a unified grand direction. This performance has deepened mutual understanding, eliminated barriers, and further promoted the great unity of revolutionary literary and artistic workers.

During the performance period, revolutionary literary and artistic workers also learned from each other, complemented each other's strengths and weaknesses, and further improved the performance level of the revolutionary model operas.

The eight revolutionary model operas performed on the stage of our country declare to the world: Our country, under the radiant guidance of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, will witness a springtime of a hundred flowers in full bloom in the realm of socialist culture. The new era of workers, peasants, and soldiers standing tall on the literary and artistic stage has arrived!

    我国文艺舞台在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下将出现百花盛开的春天
    把革命样板戏推向全国去
    八个革命样板戏在京会演胜利结束，得到广大工农兵和国际友人的高度赞扬
    新华社十六日讯　为纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年而在首都演出的八个革命样板戏——京剧《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》，受到了工农兵群众的极为热烈的欢迎。这次演出活动，已在十五日胜利结束。这次盛大的演出，历时三十七天，演出二百一十八场，接待了将近三十三万名观众。这是一次高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，展示戏剧革命成果的大会演，是一次欢庆毛主席的革命文艺路线取得巨大胜利的大会演，是首都文艺舞台上前所未有的盛事。广大工农兵观众齐声赞誉这八个革命样板戏是闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的艺术明珠。
    参加这次演出的八个革命样板戏，突出地宣传了光焰无际的毛泽东思想，突出地歌颂了历史的主人翁工农兵。它贯串着毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的革命文艺路线，体现了“百花齐放”“推陈出新”“古为今用”“洋为中用”的正确方针，做到了“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”，成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    在无产阶级文化大革命捷报频传的今天，八个革命样板戏在北京演出，这是革命文艺史上的一件大事。这次演出的胜利，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。过去，统治文艺界的陆定一、周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线，拚命抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线，反对文学艺术的革命，把文艺作为复辟资本主义的工具。但是，乌鸦的翅膀遮不住太阳。在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级文化革命的最勇敢的战士江青同志的率领下，文艺界的一批年轻的“小人物”杀出来了。他们高举《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大旗帜，向反革命修正主义文艺黑线大举进攻，经过三年多的艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于创造了八个闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命样板戏。这些革命样板戏，破天荒第一次在舞台上真正成功地塑造了历史主人翁工农兵的高大形象，把被剥削阶级颠倒了的历史又重新颠倒过来。这标志着帝王将相、才子佳人、死人洋人、老爷太太、少爷小姐统治舞台的时代完蛋了，标志着反革命修正主义文艺黑线的破产和无产阶级文艺新纪元的开始，这是无产阶级革命文艺史上具有划时代意义的光辉的新篇章。
    在首都舞台上演出的八个革命样板戏，受到了广大工农兵群众的高度赞扬，热烈欢呼！赞扬它为无产阶级革命文艺的发展树立了光辉的典范。欢呼它是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！凡是看过革命样板戏的工农兵，无不欢欣鼓舞，万分激动。他们说，这些革命的样板戏，个个自始至终都歌颂了我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想和无产阶级革命路线，歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有共产主义的远大理想和旷达胸怀的工农兵。它给了我们极其深刻的教育和鼓舞，它使我们更加无限热爱我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。这样的革命样板戏，我们就是爱看，有一千出一万出也不觉得多，看一千遍一万遍也看不够！在看了革命样板戏后，有的工农兵观众自豪地说：“样板戏好！一唱唱到咱工农兵的心里，一念念到咱工农兵的心里，这些戏才真正是咱工农兵的”。　
    有的还说，“过去看戏，看的是帝王将相、才子佳人，丑死了，现在看戏，看的是历史主人翁工农兵，美极了；过去看旧戏，听唱越听越懵懂，现在看革命样板戏，听唱一听就清楚；过去看旧戏，精神压抑，意志消沉，现在看了革命样板戏精神振奋，力量无穷”。演出时，舞台上工农兵的高大形象，时时引起台下工农兵观众的强烈反响，许多人噙着激动的泪花，情不自禁地一次又一次地鼓掌，表达广大工农兵观众对革命样板戏的高度热爱和对成功地塑造了光辉高大工农兵形象的革命文艺工作者的赞许。
    国际友人看了革命样板戏，也抑制不住心头的喜悦，他们满怀激情地说：你们正在开辟的道路，是全世界革命文艺将要走的道路，毛主席的革命文艺方向，就是全世界革命文艺的方向。正当帝国主义、现代修正主义文化走向腐朽没落的今天，在中国社会主义的文艺舞台上，巍然屹立起了历史的主人——工农兵英雄人物的光彩焕发的形象。它开创了无产阶级文艺的新纪元，它是国际无产阶级革命文艺的样板。有的外宾在看完演出后，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    这次会演，给了革命的文艺工作者莫大的鼓舞和鞭策，他们感到能在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在万众欢庆毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的光辉节日里，有机会在首都演出革命样板戏，这是毛主席和全国人民对他们的无限关怀和信任。他们为了把革命样板戏演得更好，就一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的《讲话》和新近公开发表的关于文学艺术的五个文件，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指导自己的艺术实践，以白求恩对技术工作精益求精的精神来勉励自己把戏演好。革命的文艺工作者说：我们不是为演戏而演戏，而是在打仗，在战斗，在为无产阶级专政服务，在为工农兵占领舞台阵地而夺权。每演一场戏，就是射向资本主义、封建主义、修正主义文艺的一发重型炮弹，就是刺向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一柄利剑，就是致反革命修正主义文艺黑线于死地的一声击顶响雷。我们将永远做毛泽东思想文艺大军的一名忠诚战士，在江青同志的指挥下，为完全、彻底实践毛主席的革命文艺路线而擂鼓、而呐喊、而厮杀、而奋勇向前！他们纷纷表示，今后要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起《讲话》的旗帜，深入工农兵，学习工农兵，扎扎实实地改造世界观，实现思想革命化，猛抓革命，狠促生产，决不满足已取得的成就，决心在文艺的各个领域里创造出更多、更高、更好的革命样板，让无产阶级的文艺园地，芳草如茵，鲜花开遍。
    在共同演出革命样板戏的过程中，革命的文艺工作者还深深地体会到，他们有着宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想的共同任务，有着彻底斗倒、批垮、批臭党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和以他为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线、完成本单位斗批改的共同任务，应该在大方向一致的前提下联合起来。这次会演，加深了相互了解，消除了隔阂，进一步促进了革命文艺工作者的大联合。
    演出期间，革命的文艺工作者还互相观摩、学习，取长补短，进一步提高革命样板戏的演出水平。
    在我国舞台上演出的这八个革命样板戏向全世界宣告：我们的国家，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在社会主义的文化领域里，将出现一个百花盛开的春天，工农兵昂首屹立在文艺舞台上的新时代来到了！
