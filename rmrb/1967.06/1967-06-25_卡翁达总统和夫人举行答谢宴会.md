President Kaunda of Zambia and his wife hosted a banquet in Beijing this evening to express their gratitude.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, and Xie Fuzhi, and Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Liu Ningyi were invited to attend the banquet.

President Kaunda and Premier Zhou Enlai both spoke at the banquet (full text on page 2). President Kaunda, in his speech, paid tribute to our great leader Chairman Mao, expressing great satisfaction with the smooth development of friendly relations and cooperation between Zambia and China. He wished for the continued deepening of the friendly relations between the two countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai, in his speech, praised President Kaunda's visit, stating that it has opened a new chapter in the friendly cooperation between China and Zambia.

Premier Zhou, in his speech, condemned imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries for using every means to try to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that the recent brutal suppression by British imperialism in Hong Kong against our patriotic compatriots is a major exposure of this conspiracy. Premier Zhou solemnly declared that the Chinese people, who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is shaking the world, absolutely cannot tolerate the brutal persecution of British imperialism against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The legitimate rights of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, especially their sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, must not be infringed upon by anyone. The fate of Hong Kong depends on the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people, not on the British imperialists.

President Kaunda spoke first at the banquet. He pointed out that his visit to China has been very pleasant and fruitful, and these results will certainly be developed in the context of sincere friendship and cooperation.

The President said that although China and Zambia are thousands of miles apart, they have many similarities. Wherever imperialism and old and new colonialism rear their heads, we are determined to resolutely oppose them and fight to the end. President Kaunda condemned the British and Portuguese colonialists for their colonial and racial discrimination policies in South Africa and Southwest Africa, Rhodesia, Angola, and Mozambique.

President Kaunda concluded by saying that he would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who has played a significant role and made tireless efforts in winning freedom and liberation for the people of this great country. His wise leadership has played a great role in making China what it is today—a self-reliant, united, and confident country.

Premier Zhou Enlai said at the banquet that the Chinese government has consistently and unwaveringly adhered to the "Five Principles for the Peaceful Coexistence of China with African Countries" and the "Eight Principles for China's Economic and Technical Assistance to Other Countries" to develop friendly relations with Zambia and other African countries. After President Kaunda's visit, our friendly cooperative relations have developed significantly on the basis of these principles.

Premier Zhou, when talking about our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, said that this revolution marks a new, deeper, and broader stage in the development of our socialist revolution. It is the most reliable guarantee that our Party and state will never change color. Our hundreds of millions of people, especially the younger generation, after being tempered by this revolutionary storm and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have greatly enhanced their ability to resist the infiltration of revisionist ideas. They will certainly build our country into a more prosperous socialist country, thereby further strengthening our country's support for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

Premier Zhou said that imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are terrified and hateful of the progress of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought. They have used every means to try to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. The recent brutal suppression by British imperialism in Hong Kong against our patriotic compatriots is a major exposure of this conspiracy.

Premier Zhou severely condemned the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong for carrying out a series of large-scale brutal suppressions against our patriotic compatriots. He said that the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are bravely fighting against the British imperialists and have launched a magnificent mass movement of hatred, contempt, and defiance against British imperialism, thoroughly exposing the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong over the past hundred years. The working class, young students, farmers, fishermen, and other patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are further uniting and organizing, forming a vast anti-imperialist and anti-violence army. Today, they have begun a magnificent general strike against imperialism and violence, and we express our resolute support.

Premier Zhou pointed out that Hong Kong and Kowloon have always been part of China's territory. The legitimate rights of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, especially their sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, must not be infringed upon by anyone. The Chinese people, who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is shaking the world, absolutely cannot tolerate the brutal persecution of British imperialism against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The Chinese people are determined, according to the needs of the situation, to provide all possible support to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong until final victory is achieved.

Premier Zhou said that the fate of Hong Kong depends on the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people, not on a handful of British imperialists. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must wake up. If the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong persist in their delusions, ignore the warnings of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, and continue to brutally suppress the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, insisting on being enemies of the Chinese people to the end, then they will inevitably face greater punishment and must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

Before the banquet ended, President Kaunda led the Zambian friends who accompanied him on his visit to the stage and sang loudly two Zambian freedom fighters' songs that they often sing in their struggle for freedom and independence.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai directed everyone to sing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" together.

Those who were invited to attend the banquet also included Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin and Li Siguang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo and Xu Yixin, leaders from other government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary mass organizations, and representatives from various sectors of the revolution. China's Ambassador to Zambia, Qin Lizhen, was also invited to attend the banquet.

Those who were invited to attend the banquet also included envoys from various countries to China and friends from African countries working in Beijing.

    周总理严正指出：香港九龙历来就是中国领土。中国人民绝对不能容忍英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞的残酷迫害。中国人民决心根据形势的需要，给予香港爱国同胞以一切支援，直到取得最后胜利
    据新华社二十四日讯　赞比亚共和国总统卡翁达和夫人，今晚在北京举行答谢宴会。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理李富春、陈毅、李先念、谢富治，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、刘宁一等应邀出席了宴会。
    卡翁达总统和周恩来总理在宴会上先后讲话（全文见第二版）。卡翁达总统在讲话中向我们的伟大领袖毛主席致敬，对赞中两国的友好关系和合作获得了顺利的发展表示极为满意。他祝赞中两国的友好关系不断增进。
    周恩来总理在讲话中赞扬卡翁达总统的这次访问，为中赞两国友好合作关系的发展开创了一个新的阶段。
    周总理在讲话中谴责帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派用尽各种方法妄图阻遏毛泽东思想的传播和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响。他说，最近英帝国主义在香港对我爱国同胞的残暴镇压，就是这种阴谋的大暴露。周总理严正指出，在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大胜利的中国人民，绝对不能容忍英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞的残酷迫害，香港爱国同胞的一切正当权利，特别是他们学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，绝不容许任何人侵犯。香港的命运取决于香港爱国同胞和七亿中国人民，绝不取决于英帝国主义者。
    卡翁达总统在宴会上首先讲话。他指出，他这次对中国的访问是极为欢畅和富有成果的，这种成果一定会在真诚的友谊和合作之中得到发展。
    总统说，虽然中国和赞比亚相隔万里，但是它们却有好些相同之处。帝国主义和新老殖民主义在那里抬头，我们就都决心在那里毫不犹豫地大力加以反对，并且把战斗进行到胜利为止。卡翁达总统谴责英国和葡萄牙殖民主义者对南非和西南非、罗得西亚、安哥拉和莫三鼻给实行殖民主义政策和种族歧视政策。
    卡翁达总统最后说，我愿借此机会，对中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席致敬，他在为这个伟大国家的人民赢得自由和解放中起了重大的作用，做了不倦的努力。他的英明领导在使中国成为今天这样自力更生、团结和自信的国家方面起了很大的作用。
    周恩来总理在宴会上说，中国政府一直坚持不渝地根据“中国处理同非洲国家相互关系的五项原则”和“中国政府对外提供经济技术援助的八项原则”，发展中国同赞比亚和非洲国家的友好关系。卡翁达总统这次访问以后，我们的友好合作关系在上述原则的基础上有了重大发展。
    周总理在谈到我国无产阶级文化大革命时说，这场无产阶级文化大革命，标志着我国社会主义革命发展到了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。它是使我们党和国家永不变色的最可靠保证。我国亿万群众，特别是青年一代，经过了这场革命风浪的锻炼，有了毛泽东思想为武器，大大增强了抵抗修正主义思想的侵蚀的能力。他们一定能把我国建设成为一个更加富强的社会主义国家，从而更加增强我国支援亚非人民反帝革命斗争的力量。
    周总理说，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对我国无产阶级文化大革命的进展和毛泽东思想的巨大影响，怕得要命，恨得要死。他们用尽各种方法，妄图阻遏毛泽东思想的传播。最近英帝国主义在香港对我爱国同胞的残暴镇压，就是这种阴谋的大暴露。
    周总理严厉谴责英国政府和香港英国当局对我爱国同胞进行了一系列大规模的残酷镇压。他说，香港爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同英帝国主义者英勇搏斗，并且发动了一场轰轰烈烈的仇视、鄙视和蔑视英帝国主义的群众运动，彻底揭露英帝国主义一百多年来在香港所犯下的滔天罪行。香港的工人阶级、青年学生、农民、渔民以及其他爱国同胞正在进一步团结起来，组织起来，结成浩浩荡荡的反帝抗暴大军。今天，他们开始了一场规模宏伟的反帝抗暴大罢工，我们表示坚决的支持。
    周总理指出，香港和九龙历来就是中国的领土。香港爱国同胞的一切正当权利，特别是他们学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，绝对不容许任何人侵犯。在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，取得了伟大胜利的中国人民，绝对不能容忍英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞的残酷迫害。中国人民决心根据形势的需要，给予香港爱国同胞以一切支援，直到取得最后胜利。
    周总理说，香港的命运取决于香港的爱国同胞和七亿中国人民，而绝不取决于一小撮英帝国主义者。英国政府和香港英国当局必须放清醒些。如果英国政府和香港英国当局执迷不悟，不顾中国人民和中国政府的警告，继续对香港爱国同胞进行残暴镇压，硬要同中国人民为敌到底，那么，他们就必然要受到更大的惩罚，他们应当承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    在宴会结束前，卡翁达总统带领随同他来访的赞比亚朋友，登上讲台，放声高唱他们在争取自由、独立斗争中经常唱的两首赞比亚自由战士的歌曲。
    随后，周恩来总理指挥大家齐唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    应邀出席答谢宴会的，还有政协全国委员会副主席高崇民、李四光，外交部副部长罗贵波、徐以新，政府其他部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会、革命群众组织的负责人和各界革命群众的代表。中国驻赞比亚大使秦力真也应邀出席了答谢宴会。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有各国驻中国的使节，在北京工作的非洲国家的朋友。
