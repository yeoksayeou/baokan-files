Whoever opposes our praise of Chairman Mao is our enemy.

The entire revolutionary comrades of the Chinese Revolutionary Music Association and the Chinese Music Publishing House

Supporting or opposing Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev and the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles, led by Zhou Yang, have always fiercely opposed our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. In the music world, they instructed a small group of anti-revolutionary revisionists to vehemently oppose the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the broad revolutionary masses from singing the praises of Chairman Mao, committing heinous crimes!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party maliciously attacked: “Whether Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ we need to study it to know.” He even went mad and shouted: “China also needs to oppose personality cults, do not shout ‘long live,’ do not sing ‘The East is Red’!” This is extremely reactionary and extremely evil! A small group of anti-revolutionary revisionists in the music world also maliciously slandered: “Most of the works that praise Chairman Mao are ‘endless gratitude,’ just gratitude, this is a feudalistic viewpoint.” Listen, you top capitalist-roader in the Party and the small group of anti-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles: Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in the hearts of all the revolutionary people of China and the world. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must wholeheartedly praise and sing the praises of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought!

In the seventeen years since liberation, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have created tens of thousands of songs praising Chairman Mao, expressing their deep feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader. The broad revolutionary masses want to sing the praises of Chairman Mao, but the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the small group of anti-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles are extremely afraid and extremely hostile to the masses singing the praises of Chairman Mao. They cannot suppress or block the heartfelt songs of the broad masses, so they resort to vicious means, using the old Music Association and publishing institutions they control, to order the slaughter of songs praising Chairman Mao in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1965, four times.

On October 1, 1949, the broad laboring masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers throughout China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, gained liberation. The revolutionary masses, with boundless admiration and love for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, sang the most enthusiastic songs: “Chairman Mao is our great savior,” “Chairman Mao is like our parents,” “Chairman Mao is the North Star.” But the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the small group in the literary and artistic circles hated these songs to the core and did everything they could to oppose singing the praises of Chairman Mao. In February 1951, the revisionist counter-revolutionary Zhou Yang, under the banner of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, personally instructed his henchmen to concoct a extremely vicious article, viciously slandering and belittling excellent songs praising Chairman Mao, even completely denying them. The article said these songs were “frivolous and shallow, affected and insincere, dull and lifeless, oily and slick, old-fashioned, backward and unhealthy,” and were “bad tendencies”! This was sheer nonsense! This group of revisionist counter-revolutionaries had already begun their conspiracy to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, even when the people of the whole country were celebrating liberation!

In February 1956, the Soviet revisionist leadership convened the 20th Congress, and Khrushchev threw out the “secret report” against Stalin. The Chinese Khrushchev and Zhou Yang and his gang closely coordinated, raising the black flag of supposedly opposing personality cults and personality worship, ordering the old Music Association to “examine” the “problems” in the songs praising Chairman Mao. This was the second slaughter.

After 1960, under the call of Comrade Lin Biao, a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works vigorously unfolded throughout the country. The top capitalist-roader in the Party and the kings of the old Propaganda Department were extremely afraid and extremely hateful of this mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. They wielded the two big sticks of “opposing vulgarization” and “opposing simplification,” and carried out a series of evil activities opposing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought and opposing the studying and applying of Chairman Mao’s works. At this time, the capitalist-roader in the Party within the old Music Association, following the instructions of the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the old Propaganda Department, ordered the third “examination” of the “problems” in the songs praising Chairman Mao, and during the “review” of the program for the music festival celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Yang personally appeared, cutting out all the items for setting Chairman Mao’s poems to music. This was the third slaughter.

In 1965, internationally, the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved unprecedented victories in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary struggles, and Chairman Mao established an extremely high prestige in the hearts of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Domestically, the 23 articles personally led by Chairman Mao were published nationwide, pronouncing the death sentence on the opportunistic line of the top capitalist-roader in the Party. The top capitalist-roader in the Party and his gang saw that their end was near, and they became even more frantic in their desperate struggles. The old Propaganda Department ordered the fourth time, demanding that the old Music Association “examine” and “clean up” the songs praising Chairman Mao since the founding of the country within a limited time. They also put forward extremely vicious so-called “improvement measures,” such as “recall and destroy,” “natural elimination,” “future creation of songs praising Chairman Mao must be reviewed by relevant leading organs,” etc., attempting to strangle the songs praising Chairman Mao that had already become popular among the broad revolutionary masses, and to control and restrict the new creation of songs praising Chairman Mao.

In these four slaughters, the revisionist counter-revolutionaries in the music world faithfully followed the instructions of the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the old Propaganda Department, waving the “red flag” to oppose the red flag, shooting poisonous arrows, opposing Mao Zedong Thought and our great Chairman Mao.

Their first poisonous arrow was the so-called “opposing the deification of the leader.” Such songs as “To whom does the greatest glory belong? Our leader Chairman Mao” were slandered by them as “deifying” Chairman Mao. Their intentions were so vicious!

Their second poisonous arrow was the so-called “opposing the incorrect portrayal of the Party, the leader, and the masses.” Thus, any lyrics in the songs such as “Mao Zedong is the sun of New China, opening up the direction of New China,” “Under the banner of Mao Zedong,” “The era of Mao Zedong,” “The soldiers of Mao Zedong”… were slandered by them as “inappropriate expressions,” “not correctly portraying the relationship between the Party and the leader.” But these are precisely the characteristics of our times, the bold words of the revolutionary people! We absolutely cannot tolerate them brazenly opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. What about the top capitalist-roader in the Party and his gang? Look, such a song that expresses the love of the revolutionary people of the world for Chairman Mao: “The black people shook hands with Chairman Mao, their fighting spirit is high, the black people shook hands with Chairman Mao, a bright lamp shines in their hearts, opposing racial discrimination, fighting for liberation and freedom,” was said by them to have “political errors”! The top capitalist-roader in the Party wants the politics of oppressing and exploiting the people, while we, the revolutionary people of the world, want the politics of resolutely opposing imperialism and revisionism, burying the system of exploitation, under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse of all the revolutionary people of the world! Dreaming of covering up the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought with your black hands is a pipe dream!

Their most poisonous arrow was the so-called “political and artistic levels are both low.” They wielded the big stick of opposing “simplification” and “vulgarization,” strangling one revolutionary song after another praising Chairman Mao. During the Great Leap Forward, the old men’s chorus of Yongfeng Village in Beijing wrote and sang a song “Chairman Mao is truly great,” which the masses loved very much and spread widely. But they thought it was “political and artistic levels are both low,” and in the “National Amateur Song Creation Competition,” they insisted on not giving it an award, and finally cut it out! The revolutionary fighters of the Cultural Revolution loved to sing the song “The ship sails on the vast ocean relying on the helmsman.” When it was just born, the capitalist-roader in the Party in the music world did everything they could to strangle it. They picked at it in every way, belittling the song, saying “the melody is not good to listen to,” “the lyrics are shallow,” even saying “relying on Mao Zedong Thought to do revolution, the word ‘relying’ is not appropriate.” Until April last year, the capitalist-roader in the Party in the music world still ordered “People’s Music” to collect “opinions” on “The ship sails on the vast ocean relying on the helmsman,” and he shouted: “Do you dare to publish the opinions on ‘The ship sails on the vast ocean relying on the helmsman’ all together?!” This is like an ant trying to shake a big tree, laughable and self-deluding!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party said: “Do not sing ‘The East is Red.’” Zhou Yang and his gang followed the black orders of their master, trying to cut out “The East is Red” for seventeen years. In 1951, they mentioned canceling “The East is Red”; in 1956, they even wanted to destroy the “The East is Red” records and burn the songbooks of “The East is Red”! The revolutionary faction of the proletariat said: “The loudest song is ‘The East is Red,’ the greatest leader is Mao Zedong!” We must sing “The East is Red”! Let the top capitalist-roader in the Party tremble in this magnificent song!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party is also the chief culprit of the spread of yellow music in the music world. He shamelessly said: “The ancestors of opera should be counted from Li, do not belittle Li’s creations, they… are the fathers, ‘The White-Haired Girl’ is the son,” and the gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the music world quickly promoted this ancestor of yellow music. Under his orders, the demons and snakes in the music world shouted the reactionary slogan of “reviving old songs,” and vigorously revived yellow music. What “The Songstress of the Frontier,” “The Four Seasons Song,” “How Can I Not Think of Him,” and even colonial music “The Girl on the Rickshaw,” “Night in Shanghai,” the traitor’s song “When Will You Come Again,” “The Night of China” all came out, launching a fierce attack on the Party and socialism.

After the anti-rightist struggle, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers stood up to criticize yellow music. The bourgeois elements in the music world and their representatives in the Party felt that yellow music was too naked, so according to the black instructions of their master, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, to “ban yellow books and magazines, there must be something to replace them,” they concocted the revisionist theory of “replacing yellow with light,” using “music that can make people sleep” to replace yellow music, using more hidden means to attack the proletariat. Thus, a batch of light music, light songs, Western classical songs that propagate the bourgeois decadent worldview and corrupt lifestyle were thrown out. What “Dance Music Collection,” “Classical Lyric Song Collection,” “Lullaby Collection,” “Serenade Collection,” “Italian Song Collection” and more than twenty kinds, were mass-produced and circulated nationwide. The notorious poisonous weed “Two Hundred Famous Foreign Songs” and its sequel are the worst and most poisonous medicine. It peddled Khrushchev revisionism and bourgeois freedom, equality, love, and humanity, as well as humanism, pacifism, and other black songs and black tunes. “Two Hundred” was published under the banner of the “national arts” of the Chinese Khrushchev. Its cover features a staff wrapped around a globe, isn’t this implying that these songs are not divided by national borders, not divided by classes, and anyone can sing them? During the three years of economic difficulties, this big poisonous weed was printed nine times, reaching 770,000 copies. They also used colorful sugar-coated bullets such as “The Song of Laz,” “The Peddler and the Miss,” “The Drinking Song of the Lady of the Camellias” to corrupt the revolutionary masses and prepare public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party and the small group of revisionist counter-revolutionaries in the literary and artistic circles oppose singing the praises of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought precisely because Chairman Mao led hundreds of millions of people to achieve great victories in the proletarian revolution, and because Mao Zedong Thought armed hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Whoever opposes our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, whoever opposes the lifeline of our revolutionary people, Mao Zedong Thought, is our sworn enemy, and we must unite the whole country and the whole Party to condemn and annihilate them. The world is now entering a completely new historical era. This is the new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner! We must establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, we must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must sing the praises of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought loudly. Let us use the battle songs of Mao Zedong Thought as a “powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy,” to inspire all the revolutionary people of China and the world to create a red and bright new world!

    谁反对我们歌颂毛主席，谁就是我们的敌人
    中国革命音协　中国音乐出版社全体革命同志
    拥护还是反对毛泽东思想，是革命和反革命的分水岭。中国的赫鲁晓夫，和文艺界以周扬为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一贯地疯狂反对我们伟大的领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。在音乐界，他们指使一小撮反革命修正主义分子极力反对工农兵和广大革命群众歌颂毛主席，犯下了滔天罪行！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派恶毒地攻击：“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想到底是‘是’还是‘非’，要研究一番才知道”。他甚至丧心病狂地喊出：“中国也要反对个人崇拜，不要喊万岁，不要唱《东方红》”！真是反动透顶，罪大恶极！音乐界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子也恶毒地诬蔑说：“歌颂毛主席的作品大部分是‘恩情说不完’，只是感恩，这是封建主义的观点。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，你们听着：毛主席是全中国和全世界革命人民心中永远不落的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，我们就是要尽情地颂扬，就是要尽情地歌唱！
    解放十七年来，广大工农兵群众创作了数以万计歌颂毛主席的歌曲，表达了他们对伟大领袖的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚感情。广大革命群众要歌唱毛主席，可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子却极端害怕、极端仇视群众歌颂毛主席。他们压不倒、挡不住广大群众发自内心的歌声，便狠下毒手，利用他们所控制的旧音协和出版机构，于一九五一年、一九五六年、一九六○年、一九六五年，四次下令砍杀歌颂毛主席的歌曲。
    一九四九年十月一日，全中国的工农兵广大劳动群众在毛主席、共产党的领导下，获得了翻身解放。革命群众怀着对毛主席、共产党无限爱戴、无限敬仰的激情，唱出了最热情的语言：“毛主席是咱们的大救星”，“毛主席象亲爹娘”，“毛主席是北斗星”这样一些好歌。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和文艺界的一小撮却对此恨之入骨，千方百计地反对歌颂毛主席。一九五一年二月，反革命修正主义分子周扬打着庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年的旗号，亲口授意他的爪牙炮制了一篇极为恶毒的文章，对歌颂毛主席的优秀歌曲极力诬蔑、贬低，甚至完全否定。文章说这些歌曲是“轻佻肤浅，矫揉造作，沉闷无力，油腔滑调，旧的趣味，落后不健康”，是“不好的倾向”！简直是鬼话连篇！这伙反革命修正主义分子早在全国人民欢庆解放的时候，就开始了反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的阴谋活动！
    一九五六年二月，苏联修正主义领导集团召开第二十次代表大会，赫鲁晓夫抛出了反斯大林的“秘密报告”，中国的赫鲁晓夫和周扬等一伙紧密配合，举起所谓反对个人崇拜、个人迷信的黑旗，命令旧音协进行“检查”歌颂毛主席歌曲中的“问题”。这是第二次砍杀。
    一九六○年以后，在林彪同志的号召下，一个工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，轰轰烈烈地在全国展开了。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和旧中宣部阎王殿的阎王们，对这一活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动怕得要命，恨得要死。他们抡起“反对庸俗化”、“反对简单化”的两根大棒，疯狂地进行了一系列反对宣传毛泽东思想、反对活学活用毛主席著作的罪恶活动。就在这时，旧音协党内走资本主义道路的当权派秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和旧中宣部的旨意，第三次下令“检查”歌颂毛主席歌曲中的“问题”，并在“审查”庆祝中国共产党成立四十周年音乐会的节目时，周扬亲自出马，砍掉所有的为毛主席诗词谱曲的节目。这是第三次砍杀。
    一九六五年，在国际上，亚、非、拉和世界各国革命人民在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下所进行的反帝、反修革命斗争，取得了空前的胜利，毛主席在全世界革命人民的心中树立了极高的威望。在国内，毛主席亲自领导制定的二十三条在全国公布，宣判了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派形“左”实右的机会主义路线的死刑。党内头号野心家及其一伙眼看自己的末日快要来临，更加疯狂地拚死挣扎。旧中宣部第四次下令，要旧音协限期“检查”、“清理”自建国以来的歌颂毛主席的歌曲。他们还极其恶毒地提出所谓“改进措施”，什么“收回、销毁”，什么“自然淘汰”，什么“以后创作歌颂毛主席的歌曲要经有关领导机关审查”等等，妄图扼杀已经在广大革命群众中流行的歌颂毛主席的歌曲，和控制、限制歌颂毛主席歌曲的新创作。
    在这四次砍杀当中，音乐界反革命修正主义分子忠实地遵照党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和旧中宣部的旨意，打着“红旗”反红旗，射出一支支毒箭，反对毛泽东思想，反对我们伟大的毛主席。
    他们的第一支毒箭，就是所谓“反对把领袖神化”。象这样的歌曲：“最大的光荣属于谁，我们的领袖毛主席”，竟被他们诬蔑成什么把毛主席“神化”了。他们的用心多么恶毒！
    他们的第二支毒箭是所谓“反对不正确地表现党、领袖、群众的关系”。于是，歌曲中凡是有这样的歌词：“毛泽东是新中国的太阳，开辟了新中国的方向”，“在毛泽东的旗帜下”，“毛泽东时代”，“毛泽东的战士”……都被他们诬蔑为“提法不恰当”，“没有正确表现党和领袖的关系”。可是，这些恰恰是我们时代的特征，是革命人民的豪言壮语！我们绝不能容忍他们肆无忌惮地反对毛泽东思想。
    毛主席是中国人民和世界革命人民最伟大的领袖。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其一伙又是怎样呢？请看，象这样一首表现了世界革命人民热爱毛主席的歌曲：“黑人握过毛主席的手，斗志昂扬雄赳赳，黑人握过毛主席的手，一盏明灯照心头，反对种族歧视，争取解放自由”，竟被他们说成什么“政治上有错误”！党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派要的是压迫人民、剥削人民的政治，而我们全世界革命人民，要的是在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，坚决反帝、反修，埋葬剥削制度的政治。毛泽东思想就是全世界革命人民的灯塔！妄想用你们的黑手遮住毛泽东思想的光辉，这是白日作梦！
    他们最毒的一支毒箭，就是所谓“政治水平和艺术水平都不高”。他们挥舞起反对“简单化”、“庸俗化”的大棒，扼杀了一首又一首革命人民对毛主席的赞歌。在大跃进中，北京永丰屯老头合唱队编写、演唱了一首歌曲《毛主席真伟大》，群众非常喜爱，流传很广。可是，他们竟认为是“政治水平、艺术水平都不高”，在“全国业余歌曲创作比赛”中，坚持不给评奖，最后竟砍掉了！无产阶级文化大革命的革命战士最爱唱的一首歌《大海航行靠舵手》，在刚刚诞生的时候，音乐界走资本主义道路的当权派千方百计地要扼杀它。他们百般挑剔、贬低这首歌说“曲调不好听”、“歌词单薄”，甚至说什么“干革命靠的是毛泽东思想，这个‘靠’字不妥”。直到去年四月，音乐界的党内走资本主义道路的当权派还命令《人民音乐》搜集对《大海航行靠舵手》的“意见”，他叫嚷：“你们敢不敢把对《大海航行靠舵手》的意见集中起来发表？！”这真是蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派说：“不要唱《东方红》。”周扬等一伙就按照主子的黑旨意，十七年来一直想砍掉《东方红》。一九五一年，他们就提到取消《东方红》；一九五六年，他们竟要销毁《东方红》唱片，烧掉《东方红》的歌集！无产阶级革命派说：“最响亮的歌是东方红，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东！”我们就是要唱《东方红》！让党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在这雄壮的歌声中发抖吧！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派还是音乐界黄色音乐泛滥的罪魁祸首。他无耻地说：“歌剧祖宗从黎派算起，不要轻视黎的创作，他们……是父亲，《白毛女》是儿子”，音乐界的一伙反革命修正主义分子赶紧把这个黄色音乐的鼻祖捧了出来。音乐界的牛鬼蛇神就在他的号令下，喊出了“旧歌重放”的反动口号，大肆复活黄色音乐。什么《天涯歌女》、《四季歌》、《教我如何不想他》等，以至殖民地音乐《三轮车上的小姐》、《夜上海》，汉奸歌曲《何日君再来》、《支那之夜》纷纷出笼，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。
    反右派斗争以后，广大工农兵奋起批判黄色音乐。音乐界的资产阶级分子和他们在党内的代表人物感到黄色音乐太赤裸裸了，于是按照他们的主子党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的“取缔黄色书刊，要有东西代替”的黑指示，炮制了修正主义的“以轻代黄”论，用“听了能让人睡觉”的轻音乐来代替黄色音乐，用更隐蔽的手段向无产阶级进攻。于是，一批批宣扬资产阶级腐朽人生观和糜烂生活方式的轻音乐、轻歌曲、西洋古典歌曲都被抛了出来。什么《交谊舞曲集》、《古典抒情歌曲集》、《摇篮曲集》、《小夜曲集》、《意大利歌曲集》等二十多种，大量出版，发行全国。臭名昭著流毒全国的大毒草《外国名歌二百首》及续编是最坏最毒的一剂毒药。它大肆贩卖赫鲁晓夫修正主义及资产阶级自由、平等、博爱和人性论，以及人道主义、和平主义等黑歌、黑调。《二百首》就是打着中国的赫鲁晓夫的“全民文艺”的旗号出笼的。它的封面上画着一条五线谱缠绕着一个地球仪，这不是在暗示这些歌曲是不分国界、不分阶级、任何人都可以唱的吗？在三年经济困难时期，这本大毒草先后印刷九次、达七十七万多册。他们还利用《拉兹之歌》、
  《货郎与小姐》、《茶花女饮酒歌》等五颜六色的糖衣炮弹，腐蚀革命群众，为反革命复辟准备舆论。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派以及文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子之所以反对歌颂毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想，就是因为毛主席领导亿万人民取得了无产阶级革命的伟大胜利，就是因为毛泽东思想武装了亿万革命群众。谁要是反对我们心中的最红的红太阳毛主席，谁要是反对我们革命人民的命根子毛泽东思想，谁就是我们不共戴天的敌人，就要全国共讨之，全党共诛之。现在的世界正在进入一个完全崭新的历史时代。这就是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代！我们就是要树立毛主席的绝对权威，我们就是要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。对毛主席、对毛泽东思想，我们就是要大唱特唱。让我们用毛泽东思想的战歌，作为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，鼓舞全中国和全世界亿万革命人民打出一个红彤彤的新世界！
