Title: Resolutely Stop the Trend of Armed Struggle

Armed struggle between mass organizations is not a policy of the proletariat and is definitely not a revolutionary action. Such armed struggle seriously disrupts the overall direction of the struggle, undermines great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, disrupts production, disrupts revolutionary order, and endangers the safety of the people. Such armed struggle can only make friends suffer and enemies rejoice. This trend of armed struggle must be resolutely stopped.

Currently, a slogan without class analysis is circulating among some people: "Never forget the struggle for power." We believe that there is no class-neutral power in the world; you are either seizing power for the proletariat or for the bourgeoisie. The revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionaries seizing power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are excellent! However, if one seizes power for personal gain, for a small faction, seizes power from the proletarian revolutionaries, or even resorts to armed struggle for these purposes, then that is a grave mistake and has gone to the opposite extreme.

It is inevitable and normal for mass organizations to have differing opinions on certain issues. Such contradictions can be fully resolved through great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, through big debates, big-character posters, and other methods. Revolutionary comrades must learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Comrades who have participated in conservative organizations and made mistakes should strictly demand of themselves, correct their errors. Those who do not admit their mistakes or feel aggrieved, replacing policy with emotion, are actually being driven by selfish motives. If this is not corrected in time and exploited by the enemy, they will slide down a dangerous path. Revolutionary comrades should enthusiastically and meticulously do ideological work among the masses of conservative organizations, helping them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The method of coercion cannot solve ideological problems. Leftist organizations should unite closely under the premise of a unified overall direction, directing their spearheads at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

    坚决煞住武斗这股歪风
    群众组织之间进行武斗，这不是无产阶级的政策，决不是什么革命的行动。这种武斗，严重地干扰了斗争的大方向，破坏了无产阶级专政下的大民主，破坏了生产，破坏了革命秩序，危害了人民的生命安全。这种武斗，只能使亲者痛、仇者快。必须坚决煞住武斗这股歪风。
    目前，在一些人中流传着一句毫无阶级分析的口号：念念不忘一个权字。我们认为，世界上不存在超阶级的权，你不是为无产阶级夺权，就是为资产阶级夺权。无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，是捍卫无产阶级专政的革命行动，好得很！但是，如果为个人夺权，为小集团夺权，从无产阶级革命派手里夺权，甚至为此不择手段地进行武斗，那就大错特错，走到反面去了。
    群众组织之间对某些问题存在不同的意见，这是不可避免的、正常的。这种矛盾，完全可以用在无产阶级专政下的大民主，用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报等方法解决。革命的同志必须学会正确处理人民内部矛盾。曾参加过保守组织犯了错误的同志应当严格要求自己，改正错误，那种不认错、不服气，以感情代替政策的做法，实际上是“私”字在作怪，如不及时纠正，被敌人利用，就要滑到危险的道路上去。革命派的同志对保守组织的群众，应该满腔热情地做深入细致的思想工作，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来；用压服的办法是不能解决思想问题的。左派组织之间更应该在大方向一致的前提下，紧紧地团结起来，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。（北红）
