Comrade Shehu, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Enver Hoxha, extends warm congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League

The main task of the Party at present is to advance the socialist revolution and prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has overthrown a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, which is a great victory for the Chinese people.

	NEW YORK, June 26 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, addressed the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League on June 26, representing the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, extending warm congratulations to the Congress.

	Shehu said, "Allow me, on behalf of our heroic Party Central Committee, on behalf of our people and our Party leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, to extend the most fervent revolutionary greetings and the most sincere wishes to your Fifth Congress."

	He continued, "This Congress is a major event in our national life, especially in the life of our youth, because it is convened at a time when our people, our Party, and our youth have begun to work selflessly to fulfill the great tasks set by the historic Fifth Congress of our Party; at a time when our people are striving and working hard to build a comprehensive socialist society; at a time when the revolutionization of the entire life of the state is rapidly developing and rising, leading to and will lead to a qualitative leap in the consciousness of the people, to eradicate and eliminate all traces of bourgeois ideology - harmful old customs, religious and backward prejudices, to completely uproot and eliminate all negative factors that could serve as the basis for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country."

	"You convene your Congress at a time when the international situation is characterized by the indignation of the peoples of the world against the aggression and arrogance of imperialism, against the betrayal and surrender to imperialism by modern revisionists; at a time when the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of the world against imperialism is surging, while imperialism, together with its offspring - modern revisionism, is inevitably heading towards the grave dug for it by the oppressed peoples and the working class of the world."

	"Dear delegates, you have summed up the work of your organization at your Congress and, in accordance with the directives of the Fifth Congress of our Party, have set forth your tasks for the future. The achievements of our youth are great and have a bright future."

	"In the twenty-five years of our Party's life, our youth have always been the loyal assistants of the Party, the pure and healthy reserve force of the Party, a powerful shock force of the Party in all fronts of struggle, work, study, and life. Comrade Hoxha has said: 'In our country, any transformation, any progress, any achievement, has the participation of youth, youth have shed sweat for it, and all bear the mark of the wisdom, courage, spirit of sacrifice, and glorious patriotism of our youth.'"

	"When our Party was founded twenty-five years ago, the Party members were young. At that time, Albania was under Italian Fascist occupation, and the power was in the hands of feudal and bourgeois leaders who called themselves 'fathers of the nation' and called us 'children,' calling our struggle 'child's play.' But our Party and our youth, from the very beginning, showed the world that their struggle was very serious. The blood shed by Gjimar, Berat, Vojushe, Margarite, Mistre, and thousands of other young men and women, the unprecedented individual and collective heroism shown by our youth under the leadership of the Party, laid the foundation for the new Albania, the new Albania that is our happiness today, which has become a banner of struggle for the realization of communism in the world, a model inspiring the peoples of oppressed nations."

	"Our youth have waged an unprecedented heroic struggle against the Nazi-Fascist occupiers and domestic reactionaries, so much so that the Fascists were terrified of the pioneers of 'Debatik'; at that time, Albanian girls also took up arms, crossing mountains and rivers with Albanian boys, fighting against the Fascist and Nazi occupiers, against the Barri and Zogu reactionaries, and the enemy was terrified of them. The heroic struggle of our youth, which was moving and heart-rending, old and new, showed the people of our country and the world that under the leadership of our Party, Albanian youth can take up arms and carry out the cause of defending the motherland to the end, are good at revolution, dare to overthrow and destroy everything reactionary and counter-revolutionary, dare to build new life on the ruins of the old world, and build a new world."

	"Our heroic and glorious youth have always been at the forefront of the class struggle and the struggle to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, at the forefront of the struggle to build a classless socialist society, at the forefront of the struggle to defend our socialist motherland, and have always been a main shock force of the Party. Our Party is naturally proud of our youth, and the Party nurtures youth like a mother nurtures her children, giving youth opportunities for tempering, educating, and leading them. Our heroic youth are the loyal, steadfast, and invincible reserve force of our Party, the youth of our people. Glory to our heroic youth!"

	Shehu said, "The Party has always been and is now particularly concerned about promoting the revolutionization of youth, the tempering of youth, and the class education of youth in the ideological sphere."

	"Our people have a proverb that says: 'Pear trees bear pears.' This means that youth are nurtured by the Party. Without the revolutionary leadership of the Party, youth are like children without a mother and the blind. Our youth are revolutionary youth because the Party that leads our youth is a Party that holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism."

	"We Party, is the Party that organized and led the national liberation struggle of our people and brought this struggle to victory: is the Party that successfully organized and led the struggle of our people to build the economic foundations of socialism, to transform Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country, is the Party that successfully led the struggle of our people to build a comprehensive socialist society under conditions of geographical encirclement and blockade by the imperialist-revisionists, is the Party that past and present successfully led the struggle of our people against the ambitions and plots of imperialism headed by American imperialism, is the Party that rose up against the betrayal of revisionism by the Titoites and Khrushchevites, and now is successfully leading the struggle of our people against modern revisionism. Our Party does not retreat in the face of any difficulties and any obstacles, always advances along the only correct path, along the path illuminated by the ever-youthful teachings of Marxism-Leninism."

	"The Party educates youth with its own experience, cultivating them to be its successors, forging and tempering them to always hold high the torch of revolution and never allow socialist Albania to change its revolutionary color."

	Shehu said, "Our youth, armed with the teachings of the Party, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a general offensive: on the ideological front, to eradicate all manifestations of bourgeois, reactionary, and revisionist ideology, to break with backward and evil customs, religious beliefs, and the poisons of the past, to ensure that revisionism and the restoration of capitalism do not appear in our country; on the educational and cultural front, following the great teachings of Lenin, to study, study, and study again, to build a new culture with national forms and proletarian and socialist content; on the economic front, to carry out the comprehensive construction of socialist society according to the principle of self-reliance; on the military front, to be prepared at any time to defend our socialist motherland against any enemy, against any foreign invasion from any direction."

	"Our youth have successfully completed these historic tasks. The Central Committee of the Party, the entire Party, and the people of the country wish our glorious youth greater and greater achievements in the struggle, study, work, and life on all fronts."

	Shehu went on to point out that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League was convened under the great call of the Fifth Congress of the Party, "We must be revolutionaries in our thoughts, work, and life."

	"The great revolutionary call of the Fifth Congress of the Party is the concentrated expression of the Party's line, which is not only the fundamental content of the program of work and struggle of our Party but also the fundamental content of the program of work and struggle of our youth and our people."

	"Under the current circumstances, the main historical task of our Party is to ensure the continuation of the socialist revolution and to spare no effort to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country. If the Communist Party members, youth, the working class, cooperative farmers, and intellectuals are revolutionaries in their thoughts, work, and life, then the final victory of socialism in our country is guaranteed, and there will be no possibility of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. If, on the contrary, that is to say, if the Communist Party members, youth, the working class, cooperative farmers, and intellectuals are not revolutionaries in their thoughts, work, and life, but are pseudo-revolutionaries, then the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country will be inevitable. The question is as clear as day. If this question is not understood in this way, then it is ignorant of Marxism-Leninism and the tragic fate of revisionism that has occurred in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries."

	Shehu continued, "For a long time, the Party has been concerned about educating youth. The Party educates youth to be revolutionaries in their thoughts, work, and life, to study and master Marxist-Leninist thought, to participate in class struggle, to participate in production, to wage the struggle of individual interests subordinating to collective interests, so that they are not only diligent in their studies but also know how to use the hoe in their hands to labor, and know how to use guns to strike any enemy, to defend the motherland, and at the same time to have proletarian internationalist sentiments."

	Shehu said, "Our youth are true internationalists, they are educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism. For this reason, they regard the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle. For this reason, they wholeheartedly support and resolutely stand by the just struggle of the oppressed youth of all nations against imperialism and old and new colonialism, wholeheartedly support and resolutely stand by the struggle of the Arab peoples against the aggression of Israel-imperialism. The stance of our youth and their struggle and work for the construction of socialism and the defense of the socialist motherland have shown proletarian internationalism, because the existence and progress of the People's Republic of Albania are also aid and an inspiring example for the peoples of other countries who are oppressed by imperialists or revisionists."

	Shehu said, "Our youth's Congress has dozens of youth delegations from other countries participating, who are the true representatives of the peoples of these countries, whose peoples make up more than half of the world's population. This proves that our youth have many loyal friends in the world, our youth have made many sincere friends in the world. This is because the stance of our youth has always been proletarian internationalism, unconditionally supporting the revolutionary movements and struggles of the youth of other countries against imperialism and colonialism, our youth are active fighters in the world revolutionary youth ranks. We pay tribute to the youth delegations from other countries who have come to participate in the Congress and assure them that our youth will always be loyal to proletarian internationalism."

	Shehu went on to say, "The correct attitude towards work and responsibility, high awareness, revolutionary enthusiasm in work and in the face of tasks, genuine concern for the maintenance and consolidation of socialist wealth, for the continuous growth of productive forces and the continuous improvement of socialist production relations, the courage to overcome any obstacles and difficulties, selflessness and creativity, these are the characteristics of our youth in the construction of socialism."

	"Hating the bourgeois way of life, maintaining proletarian simplicity in life, upholding correct socialist relationships in the family and society, loving, respecting, and caring for parents, hating backward and evil customs, upholding and developing good customs, fostering a collective spirit, being uncompromising towards any manifestation against socialist interests, being unyielding towards any manifestation of bourgeois and revisionist ideology, daring to make self-criticism for one's own work and mistakes, daring to criticize others' mistakes - these are some examples of the main characteristics of our youth in daily life."

	Shehu said, "The youth organization is a mass organization. It should unite the youth masses in its ranks, fight against sectarianism, to absorb the best young men and women, thereby expanding its ranks, bravely mobilizing them, and throwing them into the revolutionary actions of the youth organization. The youth organization must pay special attention to absorbing young women, especially in rural areas."

	Shehu emphasized: "Our youth are walking on the correct path indicated by the Party, therefore, the Central Committee of the Party, through the representatives of this Congress, calls on and wishes our youth to advance fearlessly on this path to victory, to be revolutionaries in thought, work, and life, to carry the revolution to the end, to pass on the revolutionary torch that the older generation will hand over to them, towards the peak of our class ideals, towards socialism and communism, to hold it higher and higher."

	Shehu then spoke about the international situation.

	He said, "Your Fifth Congress is convened at a time when the international situation is rapidly deteriorating. This rapid deterioration of the international situation is due to the policy of aggression by imperialism headed by the United States and the policy of capitulation by the modern revisionists centered on the Khrushchev leadership of the Soviet Union, whose aim is to carry out the restoration of capitalism in their own countries and to cooperate with American imperialism to strangle the liberation struggle of the peoples of the world, to suppress the peoples of the world and to rule the world."

	"But, in general, the international situation is very favorable for the struggle of the peoples of the world for freedom and independence."

	Shehu said, "For the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, their number one enemy is the People's Republic of China. Without eliminating 'this obstacle of China,' their way is definitely blocked. Therefore, they are now directing their arrows at the great People's Republic of China led by the glorious Communist Party of China and the great Marxist-Leninist thought of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. What does the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China show? It shows that the imperialists and revisionists have pinned all their hopes on the 'Trojan horse within the Great Wall of China' tactic, to 'conquer' the fortress of China from within, the means being through a handful of power-holders taking the revisionist and capitalist road, whose aim is to eliminate socialism in China and turn People's China into a revisionist and capitalist country. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has smashed the plans and hopes of the imperialists and revisionists, it has exposed and overthrown that handful of people taking the capitalist road. This is the greatest victory of the people of China since the great victory of the armed revolution of China in 1949. This is the greatest failure of the imperialists and revisionists in the contemporary world. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the victory of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought in China, not only has historical significance for the success or failure of socialism in China but also has historical significance for the success or failure of socialism in the world. Our Party, our people, and our youth wish the glorious Communist Party of China, the great people of China, the heroic youth of China, and the heroic Red Guards greater and greater success, to advance along the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, to achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China."

	"The hopes of the imperialists and revisionists in China have been dashed. China is advancing. China, on June 17 of this month, exploded its first hydrogen bomb, which was unexpected by the imperialists and revisionists. This is a new heavy blow to their plots. This brings new hope to the peoples of the world. This is a great encouragement to the peoples fighting against imperialist and colonialist oppression. The nuclear monopoly and thermonuclear monopoly of imperialism-revisionism have collapsed. Their hopes of 'containing' the great People's China have been dashed. Is this not a very important factor that proves the good situation of the revolution, socialism, and the struggle of the peoples of the world for freedom and independence, and proves the miserable situation of the imperialists and revisionists! We wish that the great China, following the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, will continue to grow stronger for the interests of all progressive peoples of the world, for the interests of the revolution and socialism."

	Shehu said, "What does the Vietnam War show? The Vietnam War shows the invincible power of the heroic Vietnamese people and the weakness of American imperialism. American imperialism, armed to the teeth with the latest weapons of war, cannot defeat a heroic small nation fighting for its existence and freedom. The mythical struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against the American invaders and their lackeys has already become a great factor inspiring the peoples of the world to struggle for freedom and independence. The struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people shows the power of the people and the weakness of the imperialists. This struggle also reveals the true face of the Soviet revisionist leadership as conspirators and capitulators. The Soviet revisionist leadership has resorted to all kinds of tricks to extinguish the struggle of the Vietnamese people, to force the Vietnamese people to sit down and negotiate with the American invaders. But to no avail. Because the heroic Vietnamese people have shown unshakable determination in their just struggle, they know that the problem will not be solved at the negotiating table, but will be solved through the armed struggle of the people on the battlefield. The Vietnamese people are digging the grave for American imperialism. This is the victory of the peoples of the world, the failure of the imperialists and revisionists."

	"We Party, our people, and our youth were, are, and will always be firmly united with the heroic Vietnamese people. We are convinced that Vietnam will win, the American invaders will be defeated, we wish the brotherly Vietnamese people final victory over the American invaders and their lackeys on the battlefield."

	Shehu said, "What does the recent aggression of Israel-imperialism against the peoples of the Arab countries show? It shows that Israel is nothing but a gangster's gun aimed at the brotherly peoples of the Arab countries by American and British imperialists. This shows that American imperialism, supported by British imperialism, cannot tolerate the freedom of the peoples of the Arab countries, seeking to rule them in order to exploit their wealth and labor. This shows that if one places hope in the Khrushchev revisionists, one cannot resist imperialist aggression, because the Khrushchev revisionists are nothing but collaborators of American imperialism, who are ready to sacrifice the freedom of the peoples of every country for the domination of the two superpowers. Therefore, this shows the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists to the Arab peoples."

	"Before the aggression of Israel, the Soviet revisionists assured the Arab peoples that Israel would not harm them, trying in every way to induce them to lay down their weapons and go to sleep. Israel, supported by the armed forces of the United States and Britain, suddenly attacked the armies of the Arab countries, catching them off guard. When Israel launched the aggression, the Soviet revisionists not only did not support the Arab peoples according to their promises but also resorted to all means to force them to stop their self-defense struggle against the Israeli aggression, to achieve a ceasefire, that is, to acknowledge their defeat. The Soviet revisionists did not provide any assistance to the Arab peoples during the aggression of Israel-imperialism but cooperated with American and British imperialism, joining forces against the Arab peoples. At the most difficult moment, they betrayed the Arab peoples, abandoned them, and left them to be trampled by the aggressors. This is the greatest betrayal."

	"But the aggression of Israel-imperialism and the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists, although they caused a temporary military defeat for the Arab countries, will also lead to a great outburst of hatred of the Arab brotherly peoples against the American and British imperialists and their tool Israel; will lead to a great outburst of hatred against the betrayal and cowardice of the Soviet revisionists. This will be beneficial to arouse the Arab peoples. These peoples, through this event, have seen who are their true friends, who are false friends, who are their enemies."

	"The peoples of the Arab countries have suffered only one defeat in one battle, but their struggle for freedom is not just one battle. This time, they lost one battle, but they have not lost the war. We are convinced that those who lost the first battle, as long as they unite to resist the threat of imperialism, as long as they do not place their hopes on the Soviet revisionists, they will eventually win their just war. In the struggle of the peoples of the Arab countries for freedom and independence, our people have been, are, and will always be on their side, and we hope they will achieve final victory in their struggle against Israel, against imperialism, and against all plots threatening their highest interests."

	Shehu said, "What does the participation of Kosygin in the United Nations General Assembly in New York show? It shows that the Soviet revisionists, after betraying the Arab peoples, seeing the hatred of the Arab peoples towards them, are trying to disguise themselves as defenders of the Arab peoples, like a drowning man clutching at straws, trying to save their prestige, trying to save what can still be saved."

	"Kosygin went to the United States, not to defend the interests of the peoples of the Arab countries, but to dig their graves, to hand over the highest interests of the peoples of the Arab countries to the butcher of the peoples of the world, the imperialist chief Johnson. Just as Johnson's armed forces are creating death in the Vietnamese people, Kosygin is shaking hands and greeting warmly with the butcher of the Vietnamese people, Johnson. Kosygin and Johnson, in their warm and obsequious talks, are trading the interests of the peoples of the world, hatching new shameful plots against the peoples of the world. The cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, started by Khrushchev and Kennedy, has been pushed to a higher level by Kosygin and Johnson. However, the talk between Kosygin and Johnson is also beneficial, it thoroughly exposes the role of the Khrushchev revisionists as the despicable lackeys of American imperialism, traitors who sell the interests of the peoples of the world, first of all the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union. This can only hasten their inevitable doom."

	Shehu said, "Those who love the freedom of their own people, those who love true and just peace, should be alert to the plots of imperialism-revisionism and draw the necessary conclusions from the tragedy of the Middle East. Otherwise, what happened today to the peoples of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan may happen to any other people tomorrow, because American imperialists will never give up aggression, and Soviet revisionists will never become honest and friends of the peoples of the world."

	Shehu said, "The People's Republic of Albania is geographically surrounded by imperialists and revisionists, and she is successfully building socialism with a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other. She is pursuing a consistent foreign policy. The Albanian people, in their thousands of years of history, have never caused trouble for anyone, but foreign occupiers have been attacking them for hundreds of years. But our people have finally won, they have become the masters of their own country, they are building socialism under the leadership of the Party, advancing bravely. We want to live in friendship with the peoples of all countries, in peace with our neighbors, in mutual understanding with all countries. We do not cause trouble for anyone. But on the other hand, we do not allow anyone to harm us. We firmly insist on this, if anyone dares to invade our territory, no matter who the invader is, no matter where the invasion comes from, Albania will fight to the end. Anyone who harms Albania will perish. The invasion of Albania will not be limited to Albania, no force or combination of forces can conquer Albania, Albania is prepared to face any test. Let those who harbor malicious plots against the People's Republic of Albania not take these words as idle talk."

	Shehu concluded: "In the name of the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, I once again congratulate you on the success of your Congress, I wish your work, your struggle, and your life to be always accompanied by victory, you are the loyal reserve force of the Party, you are holding the torch of our victorious revolution on the path of socialism and communism, I wish you these victories."

    谢胡同志代表党中央和霍查同志向阿劳动青联五大表示热烈祝贺
    阿尔巴尼亚青年是党的忠实助手和主要突击力量
    劳动党当前的主要任务是推进社会主义革命，防止出现修正主义和资本主义复辟中国文化大革命打倒了一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是中国人民的伟大胜利
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，二十六日在阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会上发表讲话，代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和恩维尔·霍查同志向大会表示热烈祝贺。
    谢胡说，请允许我代表我们英雄的党中央委员会，代表我国人民和我们党的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，向你们的第五次代表大会致以最热烈的革命敬礼和最真诚的祝愿。
    这次代表大会是我们全国生活中、特别是青年生活中的一件大事，因为它是在这样的时刻召开的：我国人民、我们党和我们青年已开始了完全忘我的劳动，以便实现具有历史意义的党的第五次代表大会所制定的伟大任务；在我国的生活中，人们正在为全面建设社会主义社会而紧张地斗争和工作；国家整个生活的革命化正在迅速发展和日益高涨，从而已经导致和正在导致人们觉悟的质的飞跃，以便根除和消灭资产阶级思想的一切痕迹——有害的旧风俗，宗教的和落后的偏见，彻底铲除和消灭能够作为在我国出现修正主义和复辟资本主义的基础的一切消极因素。
    你们的代表大会是在这样的时刻召开的：国际局势的特点是，各国人民义愤填膺地反对帝国主义的侵略和嚣张气焰，反对现代修正主义者对各国人民的背叛和向帝国主义投降；各国人民的革命和反对帝国主义的斗争浪潮正在不断高涨，而帝国主义却不可避免地带着它的后代——现代修正主义，正在不断走向各国被压迫人民和工人阶级为它所挖掘的坟墓。
    亲爱的男女青年代表们，你们在你们的代表大会上总结了你们组织的工作，并按照党的第五次代表大会的指示，规定了今后的任务。我国青年的工作的成绩是巨大的，并且有着光辉的前景。
    在我们党的生活的二十五年中，我国青年始终是党的忠实助手，党的纯洁和健全的后备军，是党在斗争、工作、学习和生活等所有战线上的一支强有力的突击队。霍查同志说过：“在我国，任何一项改造，任何一项进步，任何一项成就，都有青年参与，青年都为之流下了汗水，无不刻上了我国青年的智慧、勇敢、牺牲精神和光辉的爱国主义标记”。
    我们党在二十五年前创建的时候，党员都是年轻的。当时阿尔巴尼亚处于意大利法西斯占领之下，政权掌握在封建和资产阶级头目手里，他们竟然自称“民族之父”，把我们叫作“小孩子”，把我们的斗争叫作“儿戏”。但是，我们党和我国青年，从一开始就向全世界表明他们的斗争是十分严肃认真的。吉马尔，贝尔拉特，沃约，马格莉塔，米斯托，以及数以千计的男女青年流下的鲜血，我国青年在党的领导下所表现的个人和集体的前所未有的英雄气概，奠定了新阿尔巴尼亚的根基，新阿尔巴尼亚就是我们今天的幸福，她已成为在世界上争取实现共产主义的一面战斗的旗帜，已成为鼓舞各个被压迫国家人民的一个榜样。
    我国青年为反对纳粹—法西斯占领者和国内反动派进行了史无前例的英勇斗争，以至法西斯分子对“德巴蒂克”的先驱战士怕得要死；当时，阿尔巴尼亚的女青年也拿起武器，同阿尔巴尼亚男青年一道越过千山万水，同法西斯和纳粹占领者，同巴里和卓古反动派进行了战斗，敌人对她们怕得要死。我国的英雄青年所进行的这场可歌可泣、惊心动魄、破旧立新的斗争，向我国人民和全世界表明，在我们党领导下的阿尔巴尼亚青年能够拿起武器把保卫祖国的事业进行到底，善于进行革命，敢于推翻和破坏一切反动的、反革命的东西，敢于在旧世界的废墟上建立新生活，建设新世界。
    我国英雄的、光荣的青年，站在阶级斗争和加强工人阶级专政的斗争的前列，站在建设没有阶级的社会主义社会的斗争的前列，站在保卫我们社会主义祖国的斗争的前列，始终是党的一支主要突击力量。我们党理所当然地为我国的青年感到自豪，党象母亲培养孩子一样培养青年，党给青年以锻炼的机会，教育和领导青年。我国的英雄青年是我们党的忠实、坚定的和无往而不胜的后备军，是我国人民的青春，光荣属于我国的英雄青年。
    谢胡说，党对于促进青年的革命化、青年的锻炼和对于青年的意识形态方面的阶级教育，过去和现在一直是特别关心的。
    我国人民有一句谚语说：“梨树结梨子。”这就是说，青年是要由党培育的。如果没有党的革命领导，青年就象失去母亲的孩子和盲人。我国的青年是革命的青年，因为领导我国青年的党，是高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的党。
    我们的党，是组织我国人民进行民族解放斗争和把这场斗争引向胜利的党：是党胜利地组织和领导了我国人民为建设社会主义的经济基础、为把阿尔巴尼亚从落后的农业国改造成为农业工业国而进行的斗争，是党胜利地领导我国人民在地理上处于被包围和在帝修实行封锁的情况下进行全面建设社会主义社会的斗争，是党过去和现在胜利地领导我国人民为反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的野心和阴谋而进行的斗争，是党奋起反对铁托分子和赫鲁晓夫分子的修正主义背叛，现在又正在胜利地领导我国人民进行反对现代修正主义的斗争。我们党在任何困难和任何障碍面前都毫不退缩，始终沿着唯一正确的道路，沿着永葆青春的马列主义学说照耀下的道路向前迈进。
    党用自己的经验教育青年，培养他们成为自己的接班人，把他们造就和锻炼成为始终能高举革命火炬，和决不容许社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚改变革命颜色的青年。
    谢胡说，用党的教导武装起来的我国青年，在党的领导下发动了总攻击：在思想战线上，根除资产阶级的、反动的和修正主义的思想的一切表现，破除落后的恶劣风俗、宗教信仰、过去的遗毒，保证在我国不出现修正主义和资本主义复辟；在教育和文化战线上，遵循伟大列宁的教导，学习，学习，再学习，以便建立具有民族形式，具有无产阶级和社会主义内容的新文化；在经济战线上，按照自力更生的原则，进行社会主义社会的全面建设；在军事战线上，准备好随时保卫我们的社会主义祖国，对付任何敌人，对付不论来自何方的任何外国侵略。
    我国青年胜利地完成了这些历史任务。党中央委员会、全党、全国人民，祝愿我国光荣的青年在斗争、学习、工作和生活各个战线上，取得日益巨大的成就。
    谢胡接着指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会，是在党的第五次代表大会提出的“我们要在思想上、工作上和生活上都成为革命者”这一伟大号召下召开的。
    党的第五次代表大会的伟大革命号召，是党的路线的集中表现，它不仅是我们党的工作和斗争纲领的根本内容，而且也是我国青年和我国人民的工作和斗争纲领的根本内容。
    在当前的情况下，我们党的主要历史任务，是保证把社会主义革命继续进行下去，竭尽全力防止在我国出现修正主义和资本主义复辟。如果共产党员、青年、工人阶级、合作社的农民、人民知识分子在思想上、工作上和生活上都是革命者，那么社会主义在我国的最后胜利就有了保证，就没有任何可能出现修正主义和资本主义复辟。如果相反，换句话说，如果共产党员、青年、工人阶级、合作社的农民、人民知识分子，在思想上、工作上和生活上不是革命者，而是假革命，那么在我国出现修正主义和资本主义复辟将是不可避免的。问题就是这样明摆着的。如果不是这样理解这个问题，那就是对马克思列宁主义，对在苏联和其他许多社会主义国家出现的修正主义悲剧一无所知。
    谢胡同志接着说，长期以来，党对教育青年是关怀的。党教育青年，是为了使他们在思想上、工作上和生活上都成为革命者，专心学习、掌握马克思列宁主义思想，参加阶级斗争，参加生产，进行个人利益服从整体利益的斗争，使他们不仅勤奋读书，又会用手中的镐从事劳动，而且会使用枪支打击任何敌人，保卫祖国，同时使他们有无产阶级国际主义的感情。
    谢胡说，我国青年是真正的国际主义者，他们是受了无产阶级国际主义精神的教育的。正因为这样，他们就把越南人民的英勇斗争看作是自己的斗争。正因为这样，他们全力支援和坚决支持被压迫各民族青年所进行的反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义奴役的正义斗争，全力支援和坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对以色列—帝国主义侵略的斗争。我国青年的立场，以及他们为建设社会主义和保卫社会主义祖国而进行的斗争和工作，表现了无产阶级国际主义，因为阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的存在和进步，对于受到帝国主义者或者修正主义者的压迫的其他各国人民来说，也就是援助，也就是鼓舞人心的一个积极的榜样。
    谢胡说，我国青年的这次代表大会，有几十个青年代表团前来参加，他们是自己国家人民的真正代表，这些国家的人民占世界人口半数以上。这证明，我国青年在世界上有许多忠实的朋友，我国青年在世界上结交了许多真挚的朋友。这是因为我国的青年的立场始终是无产阶级国际主义的，毫无保留地支持其他国家青年的反帝反殖的革命运动和斗争，我国青年是世界革命青年队伍中的积极战士。我们向前来参加代表大会的其他国家的青年代表团致敬，并且向他们保证，我国青年将永远忠于无产阶级国际主义。
    谢胡接着说，对待工作和职责的正确态度和高度觉悟，工作上和在任务面前的革命热情，对于维护和巩固社会主义财富，对于生产力的不断增长和社会主义生产关系的不断改善的真正关心，克服任何障碍和困难的勇气，忘我和创造精神，以上这些就是我国青年在建设社会主义的劳动中所表现的特点。
    痛恨资产阶级生活方式，在生活上保持无产阶级的朴素作风，在家庭中和社会上坚持正确的社会主义的关系，热爱、尊重和照顾父母，痛恨落后的恶劣风俗，维护和发扬优良的习俗，发扬集体精神，对违反社会主义利益的任何表现毫不妥协，对资产阶级和修正主义思想的任何表现毫不调和，对自己的工作和自己的错误敢于作自我批评，对别人的错误敢于提出批评——以上所列举的就是我国青年在日常生活中的主要特点的若干例子。
    谢胡说，青年组织是群众组织。它应该把青年群众团结在自己的队伍中，同宗派主义作斗争，以便吸收最优秀的男女青年，从而扩大自己的队伍，勇敢地把他们带动起来，投入青年组织的革命行动。青年组织必须特别注意吸收女青年，特别是在农村里。
    谢胡强调指出：我国青年走的是党所指明的正确道路，因此党中央委员会通过这次代表大会的代表们，号召和祝愿我国青年一往无前地在这条道路上胜利前进，在思想、工作和生活上都表现出是一个革命者，把我国革命进行到底，把老一辈将要交给他们的革命火炬，朝着我们阶级的理想顶峰，朝着社会主义和共产主义，越举越高。
    谢胡接着谈到了国际形势。
    他说，你们的第五次代表大会是在国际局势迅速恶化的时刻举行的。国际局势的这种迅速恶化是来自以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和以苏联赫鲁晓夫领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者的投降主义政策，它们的目的是在自己国家里实行资本主义复辟和同美帝国主义进行合作，以便扼杀各国人民的解放斗争，镇压各国人民和统治世界。
    但是，总的说来，国际局势对各国人民争取自由和独立的斗争是非常有利的。
    谢胡说，对于美国帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者说来，他们的头号敌人是中华人民共和国。不消除“中国这个障碍”，他们的道路就肯定是走不通的。因此，他们在今天把矛头指向由光荣的中国共产党和由中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想领导的伟大的中国。中国无产阶级文化大革命表明什么？它表明，帝国主义者和修正主义者把他们的全部希望，寄托在通过“中国长城内的特洛伊木马”的手法，“从内部”攻占中国这个堡垒的愿望之上，其办法就是通过一小撮走修正主义与资本主义道路的当权派，这一小撮人的目的是要在中国消灭社会主义和把人民中国变成一个修正主义和资本主义国家。中国无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了帝国主义者和修正主义者的这些计划和希望，它揭露和打倒了那一小撮走资本主义道路的人。这是继一九四九年伟大的中国武装革命胜利之后人民中国最伟大的胜利。这是帝国主义者和修正主义者在当代的最大的失败。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想在中国的胜利，不仅对社会主义在中国的成败具有历史性的重大意义，而且对社会主义在全世界的成败也具有历史性的重大意义。我们党、我国人民和我国青年祝光荣的中国共产党、伟大的中国人民、英勇的中国青年、英勇的红卫兵取得越来越大的成功，沿着毛泽东同志制定的道路，使无产阶级文化大革命在中国取得最后胜利。
    帝国主义者和修正主义者的希望在中国破灭了。中国在向前迈进。中国在本月十七日爆炸了第一颗氢弹，这是出乎帝国主义者和修正主义者意料的。这对他们的阴谋是一个新的沉重的打击。这给世界各国人民带来了新的希望。这对反对帝国主义和殖民主义压迫的人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。帝国主义—修正主义的核垄断和热核垄断破产了。他们“遏制”伟大的人民中国的希望落空了。这不是证明革命、社会主义、各国人民争取自由和独立的斗争的大好形势和证明帝国主义者和修正主义者的悲惨处境的一个非常重要的因素吗！我们祝愿，遵循毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的伟大的中国为世界全体进步人民的利益、为革命和社会主义的利益而不断壮大。
    谢胡说，越南战争说明了什么呢？越南战争表明了英勇的越南人民不可战胜的力量和美帝国主义的虚弱。用最新式战争武器武装到牙齿的美帝国主义，无法打败一个为自身的生存和自由而斗争的英勇的小国人民。英勇的越南人民反对美国侵略者及其走狗的神话般的斗争，已经成为鼓舞全世界人民为争取自由和独立而斗争的一个伟大的因素。英勇的越南人民的斗争，表明了人民的力量和帝国主义者的虚弱。这一斗争，还表明了苏联修正主义领导集团是共谋者和投降主义者的真面目。苏联修正主义领导集团耍尽了一切阴谋诡计，企图扑灭越南人民的斗争，强迫越南人民同美国侵略者坐下来谈判。但是毫无结果。因为英勇的越南人民在他们的正义斗争中表现了不可动摇的决心，他们知道，问题不会在谈判桌上解决，而是要通过人民的武装斗争在战场上解决。越南人民正在为美帝国主义挖掘坟墓。这是各国人民的胜利，是帝国主义者和修正主义者的失败。
    我们党、我国人民和我国青年过去是，现在是，将来永远坚定不移地同英勇的越南人民团结在一起。我们深信，越南必胜，美国侵略者必败，我们祝兄弟的越南人民在战场上对美国侵略者及其走狗取得最后胜利。
    谢胡说，最近发生的以色列—帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的侵略表明了什么呢？它表明，以色列只不过是美国和英国帝国主义者对准着兄弟的阿拉伯各国人民的一支强盗的手枪。这表明，得到英帝国主义支持的美帝国主义不能容忍阿拉伯各国人民的自由，企图统治他们，以便剥削他们的财富和劳动。这表明，如果人们把希望寄托在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者身上，就无法抵抗帝国主义侵略，因为赫鲁晓夫修正主义者只不过是美帝国主义的合作者，他们为了两个大国主宰世界准备随时牺牲每个国家人民的自由。因此，这就说明了苏联修正主义者对阿拉伯人民的背信弃义。
    在以色列的侵略开始之前，苏联修正主义者向阿拉伯人民担保，以色列不会对他们有任何损害，千方百计地引诱他们放下武器，去睡大觉。得到美英武装部队支持的以色列，突然地进攻了阿拉伯国家的军队，使之措手不及。当以色列发动侵略时，苏联修正主义者不仅不按照自己的诺言支援阿拉伯各国人民，反而不择手段地迫使他们停止反对以色列侵略的自卫斗争，以便实现停战，也就是承认自己的失败。苏联修正主义者在以色列—帝国主义者进行侵略时，没有给予阿拉伯人民任何援助，而是同美英帝国主义合作，合伙反对阿拉伯人民。在最艰难的时刻，出卖阿拉伯人民，抛弃他们，任凭侵略者去蹂躏他们。这是最大的背信弃义。
    但是，以色列—帝国主义者的侵略和与这一侵略相配合的苏联修正主义者的背叛，虽然使阿拉伯国家在军事上遭到暂时的失败，然而就象火山要爆发一样，这种侵略和背叛也将导致阿拉伯兄弟人民对美英帝国主义者和它们的工具以色列的仇恨的大爆发；将导致他们对苏联修正主义者的背叛和怯懦的背信弃义行为的仇恨的大爆发。这将有利于唤起阿拉伯人民。这些人民通过这次事件，认清了谁是真正的朋友，谁是假朋友，谁是他们的敌人。
    阿拉伯各国人民仅仅在一个战役中遭到了失败，而他们的争取自由的斗争却不是只包括一个战役。这一次，他们打输了一个战役，但并没有打输战争。我们深信，那些打输了第一个战役的人，只要他们团结起来反对帝国主义的威胁，只要他们不把他们的希望寄托在苏联修正主义者身上，他们便将终于打赢他们的正义战争。在阿拉伯各国人民争取自由和独立的斗争中，我国人民过去、现在和将来始终都站在他们一边，并希望他们在反对以色列、反对帝国主义和反对威胁着他们的最高利益的一切阴谋方面取得最后胜利。
    谢胡说，柯西金参加纽约联合国大会表明了什么？它表明，苏联修正主义者在他们背叛阿拉伯人民以后，看到阿拉伯人民对他们的憎恨，因而竭力装扮成阿拉伯人民的保卫者，象溺水的人抓住自己的头发一样，力图挽救他们的威信，力图挽救还可能挽救的东西。
    柯西金去美国，不是为了保卫阿拉伯各国人民的利益，而是为了去为他们掘坟墓，去把阿拉伯各国人民的最高利益委交给屠杀各国人民的刽子手、帝国主义头子约翰逊。正当约翰逊的武装部队在越南人民中制造死亡的时候，柯西金却在同屠杀越南人民的刽子手约翰逊无比亲切和卑躬屈膝地握手言欢。柯西金和约翰逊在他们亲热的会谈中，把各国人民的利益拿来做交易，对各国人民搞了新的可耻阴谋。由赫鲁晓夫同肯尼迪开始搞起的苏美合作，已被柯西金和约翰逊推到了一个更高的水平。然而，柯西金和约翰逊的这次会谈，也是有益处的，它彻底暴露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所扮演的美帝国主义的卑鄙走狗，出卖世界各国人民利益、首先是苏联各族人民利益的叛徒的角色。这一点只能加速他们的不可避免的末日的到来。
    谢胡说，那些爱好本国人民自由的人，那些爱好真正的和正义的和平的人，都应该对帝国主义—修正主义者的阴谋提高警惕，并从中东的悲剧中得出必要的结论。否则，今天对阿联、叙利亚和约旦人民发生的事情，明天便很可能对任何别国人民发生，因为美帝国主义者是决不会放弃侵略的，而苏联修正主义者也决不会变得老实和变成各国人民的朋友的。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国地理上处于帝国主义者和修正主义者的包围之中，她正一手拿镐、一手拿枪成功地建设社会主义。她奉行着一种始终如一的对外政策。阿尔巴尼亚人民在他们几千年的历史上，从来没有给任何人造成过烦恼，而外国占领者在几百年中却一直在进攻他们。但是，我国人民终于取得了胜利，他们成了自己国家的主人，他们在党的领导下建设社会主义，一向勇往直前。我们愿意同各国人民友好相处，同我们的邻国和平相处，同一切国家互相谅解地相处。我们不给任何人造成烦恼。但是，另一方面，我们也不容许任何人损害我们。我们坚决坚持这一点，假如有人敢于侵犯我们的领土，不管侵略者是谁，不管侵略来自何方，阿尔巴尼亚都将战斗到底。任何损害阿尔巴尼亚的人，都将灭亡。对阿尔巴尼亚进行的侵略不可能仅仅局限在阿尔巴尼亚，任何力量或力量的联合都决不可能征服阿尔巴尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚准备经受任何的考验。希望那些怀有反对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的阴险图谋的人，不要把这些话当做耳边风。
    谢胡最后说：我以党中央和恩维尔·霍查同志的名义，再一次祝你们代表大会的工作成功，祝你们的工作、你们的斗争和你们的生活中永远不可分地伴随着胜利，你们是党的忠实的后备力量，你们举着我们在社会主义和共产主义道路上胜利革命的火炬，我祝你们取得这些胜利。
