The Soviet revisionist leader Khrushchev, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, praised the United Nations to the skies, as if it were a godsend.

Clearly, the United Nations, under the manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, has repeatedly used so-called "ceasefire" resolutions to shield and encourage the Israeli aggressors, obstructing the Arab people's resistance to aggression, and committing unforgivable crimes. Yet, Khrushchev absurdly claimed that the United Nations had played a "not small" role in the recent Middle East conflict.

Clearly, the United Nations has not dared to touch the U.S. imperialists and their lackey Israel even once. Yet, Khrushchev absurdly claimed that the Security Council's "resolutions themselves are condemnations of the aggressors."

Clearly, the United Nations, under the guise of "maintaining peace," has been engaged in shielding imperialist aggression, committing heinous crimes, and losing its reputation. Yet, Khrushchev absurdly claimed that the United Nations is "serving the cause of maintaining peace and international security," and can "speak out for justice and peace."

According to Khrushchev, the United Nations is practically the god of humanity today, capable of saving the suffering, bestowing peace, happiness, and tranquility upon all nations. Is there anything more shameless than this absurd dream?

The great revolutionary leader Lenin pointed out more than forty years ago that the League of Nations is a "united front of oppressors." Today's United Nations, compared to the League of Nations of yesteryears, is even more ruthless in suppressing the revolutionary movements of various countries. Yet, Khrushchev praised the United Nations as a super organization that stands above imperialism and oppressed nations, capable of "speaking out for justice" and mediating international class struggles, and vigorously promoting the fallacy of international class cooperation. This is an outright betrayal of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet revisionist clique is doing this entirely to cater to the needs of U.S.-led imperialism. This once again clearly exposes the Soviet revisionist clique as the greatest traitor to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

Countless facts prove that the United Nations is a tool for U.S. imperialism to carry out its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, and a tool for the Soviet revisionists to collaborate with U.S. imperialism in carrying out its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. They use the United Nations platform to deceive the people of various countries with hypocritical sermons, empty promises, and endless discussions, diverting the attention of the people of various countries and spreading impractical illusions. They also, under the banner of the United Nations, openly suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. The blue and white flag of the United Nations is stained with the blood of the Korean people, the Kashmiri people, the Congolese people, the Dominican people, the Cypriot people, and so on. In short, the United Nations plays the role of a deceiver and an executioner.

The United Nations does nothing but evil because it has become a place for big powers to collude, a tool for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to carry out "power politics." In the United Nations, truly socialist countries have insisted on principled struggles, and many Asian and African countries have made considerable efforts to oppose imperialist aggression. However, their opinions are not respected. The ones who truly control the United Nations are, in the past, the U.S. imperialists alone, and now, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists together. Who has the final say in the United Nations can be seen more clearly from this Middle East incident. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have reached an agreement behind the scenes, concocting the so-called Security Council "ceasefire" resolution, which becomes a sacred edict. Although this resolution obviously harms the interests of the Arab countries, the Arab countries are forced to accept it. The so-called United Nations organizations are, in essence, nothing more than organizations for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to manipulate other countries.

Khrushchev's particular eagerness in glorifying the United Nations is, in fact, a glorification of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists themselves. Since the United Nations has "accomplished" something, then this "accomplishment" must first be credited to the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, who act in unison in the United Nations. Since the "resolutions themselves are condemnations of the aggressors," then how can it still be said that the U.S. imperialists, who concocted these resolutions, are aggressors? More importantly, since the United Nations can "uphold justice," then how can the Arab people not wait for the U.S. and Soviet-controlled United Nations to act on their behalf?

It is clear that Khrushchev's praise of the United Nations is not only to cover up the Soviet revisionist clique's crime of betraying the Arab people, nor is it only to cover up the U.S. imperialists' crime of aggression against the Arab countries, but also to further collude with U.S. imperialism, continue to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world under the banner of the United Nations, and lead the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle astray. The intentions of the Soviet revisionist clique are extremely sinister and malicious.

However, the dirty deals between the Soviet revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism in the United Nations can only add new, shameful records to the United Nations' evil history. The Arab people have seen through the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique, and they will also see through the reactionary nature of the United Nations, thoroughly spitting on it along with the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists.

    柯西金美化联合国居心何在？
    本报评论员
    苏修头目柯西金在联合国大会的发言中，把联合国吹得天花乱坠，简直捧上了天。
    明明联合国在美苏操纵下，几次三番用所谓“停火”决议来包庇和纵容以色列侵略者，阻止阿拉伯人民抗击侵略，犯下了不可饶恕的罪行，柯西金却胡说什么联合国在这次中东事件中立下了“不小的功劳”。
    明明联合国对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列碰也没敢碰一下，柯西金却胡说什么安理会的“决议本身就是对侵略者的谴责”。
    明明联合国打着“维护和平”的幌子，专干庇护帝国主义侵略的勾当，罪恶累累，名誉扫地，柯西金却胡说什么联合国是“为维护和平和国际安全的事业服务”的，能够“为公道、为和平仗义执言”。
    按照柯西金的说法，联合国简直就是今天人类的上帝，它能够救苦救难，赐给各国人民以和平、幸福和安宁。难道还有比这种荒唐的梦呓更无耻的吗？
    伟大的革命导师列宁四十多年前曾经一针见血地指出，国际联盟是“‘联合的’压迫者。”今天的联合国，比起当年国际联盟来，在镇压各国人民革命运动方面，更是有过之无不及。而柯西金竟然把联合国说成是驾凌在帝国主义和被压迫民族之上的，可以“仗义执言”、调和国际阶级斗争的超然组织，大肆鼓吹国际阶级合作的谬论，这是对马克思列宁主义最露骨的背叛。苏修集团这样做，完全是适应以美国为首的帝国主义的需要。这就再一次清楚地暴露了苏修集团是世界人民革命事业的大叛徒。
    无数事实证明，联合国是美帝国主义实行反革命两手策略的工具，是苏修集团配合美帝国主义实行反革命两手策略的工具。它们利用联合国的讲坛，以虚伪的说教、空洞的诺言、无休止的讨论，来迷惑各国人民，转移各国人民的视线，散布不切实际的幻想。它们又打着联合国的旗号，赤裸裸地镇压各国人民的革命斗争。联合国的蓝白旗，沾满了朝鲜人民、克什米尔人民、刚果（金）人民、多米尼加人民、塞浦路斯人民……的血迹。总之，联合国是扮演着骗子手和刽子手的角色。
    联合国之所以尽干坏事而干不了一点好事，就是因为它成了大国勾结的场所，成了美苏推行“强权政治”的工具。在联合国中，真正的社会主义国家坚持了原则的斗争，许多亚非国家也为反对帝国主义侵略作了不少努力。但是，他们的意见并不能受到尊重。真正对联合国起支配作用的，过去是美帝国主义一家，现在则是美帝和苏修两家。在联合国内，到底是谁说了算，从这次中东事件中就可以看得更清楚。美帝和苏修在幕后谈妥了交易，炮制出所谓安理会的“停火”决议，就成为圣旨。尽管这种决议明显地损害阿拉伯国家的利益，阿拉伯国家也要被迫接受。所谓联合国机构，说穿了，不过是美苏联合摆布其他国家的机构罢了。
    柯西金如此特别起劲地美化联合国，实际上就是美化美帝和苏修自己。既然联合国是立了“功劳”的，那末，这份“功劳”怎么能不首先归于在联合国中一致行动的美帝和苏修呢？既然联合国的“决议本身就是对侵略者的谴责”，那末，怎么还能认为炮制这些决议的美帝国主义是侵略者呢？尤其重要的是，既然联合国是能够主持“公道”的，那末，阿拉伯人民怎么能不等待美苏操纵的联合国来给他们作主呢？
    十分清楚，柯西金吹捧联合国，不仅是为了掩饰苏修集团出卖阿拉伯人民的罪行，也不仅是替美帝国主义掩饰它侵略阿拉伯国家的罪行，而且是为了进一步勾结美帝国主义，在联合国旗帜下继续镇压世界人民的革命，把阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争引入歧途。苏修集团的用心，是十分阴险、十分恶毒的。
    但是，苏修集团同美帝国主义在联合国的肮脏交易，只能给联合国的丑恶历史增加新的、可耻的纪录。阿拉伯人民看透了苏修集团的叛徒嘴脸，他们也必将看透联合国的反动本质，把它同美帝苏修一起彻底唾弃。
