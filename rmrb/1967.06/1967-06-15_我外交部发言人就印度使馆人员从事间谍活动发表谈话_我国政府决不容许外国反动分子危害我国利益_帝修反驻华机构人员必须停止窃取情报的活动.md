The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson issued a statement on June 14 regarding the espionage activities of Indian embassy personnel in Beijing. The Chinese government will not allow foreign reactionaries to harm China's interests. Personnel from imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary organizations stationed in China must cease their activities of stealing intelligence.

	New China News Agency, June 14 -- The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on June 14 regarding the espionage activities of Indian embassy personnel in Beijing. The statement is as follows:

	Since the beginning of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Second Secretary of the Indian Embassy in China, Lu Guannan, has consistently violated the laws of the People's Republic of China, brazenly engaging in illegal activities to steal China's political and military intelligence. He has been caught multiple times by Red Guards and revolutionary masses, who have warned him. However, Lu Guannan not only showed no signs of stopping but escalated his actions. On June 4 this year, he dared to collaborate with the Third Secretary of the embassy, Weijie, to secretly photograph a military restricted area. They were caught in the act by the People's Liberation Army. The facts prove that Lu Guannan is a spy disguised as a diplomat. The Chinese government is extremely indignant about the blatant espionage activities of Indian embassy personnel and has lodged the strongest protest with the Indian government. Chinese judicial authorities have sentenced Lu Guannan as a spy and will expel him from the country immediately. At the same time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has declared Weijie as an unwelcome person and ordered him to leave Chinese territory within a specified period.

	The espionage activities of Indian embassy personnel in China during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are not isolated incidents.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has not only shattered the dreams of imperialists and revisionists to restore capitalism in China but has also opened a new era for the world proletarian socialist revolution. The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, and all reactionaries have sensed that their end is near. However, they are not willing to accept defeat and will make their last struggles, launching wave after wave of anti-China campaigns, crazily opposing and viciously attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For this purpose, they have instructed personnel and journalists from imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary organizations stationed in China to use all means to engage in various illegal activities, trying every means to steal China's political, military, and economic intelligence, and collecting ammunition for anti-China propaganda.

	These foreign reactionaries, driven by their anti-China needs, have ulterior motives and go everywhere, secretly photographing, copying, and stealing big-character posters; using various conspiracies to collect a large number of newspapers, magazines, booklets, and leaflets published by various revolutionary mass organizations in China; pretending to be friendly to China and probing into internal affairs of the Chinese people; disguising as Chinese people to infiltrate Chinese institutions, organizations, schools, and enterprises, and even illegally crossing restricted areas for foreigners to secretly photograph restricted areas, among other countless crimes.

	The Red Guards and broad revolutionary masses in China, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and are advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have repeatedly caught these black hands red-handed while they were stealing China's intelligence and given them severe warnings. However, as Chairman Mao taught us, "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause; they are doomed to fail." These foreign reactionaries' activities of stealing China's intelligence have not only shown no signs of stopping but have become increasingly rampant. They are true gamblers who will not stop until they have lost everything.

	We solemnly warn these foreign reactionaries: The Chinese government and the broad revolutionary masses in China will not allow you to engage in activities that harm China's national interests on Chinese soil. You must abide by China's laws, respect China's revolutionary order, and stop all your illegal activities. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising therefrom will be borne by yourselves. Lu Guannan, the Second Secretary of the Indian Embassy in China, and Weijie, the Third Secretary, are your precedents.

    我外交部发言人就印度使馆人员从事间谍活动发表谈话
    我国政府决不容许外国反动分子危害我国利益
    帝修反驻华机构人员必须停止窃取情报的活动
    新华社十四日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人十四日就印度驻华大使馆人员在北京从事间谍活动一事，发表谈话如下：
    印度驻华大使馆二等秘书鲁冠南自我国无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，一贯违反中华人民共和国法令，肆无忌惮地进行窃取我国政治、军事情报的非法活动，多次被我红卫兵小将和革命群众当场抓住并给予警告。但是，鲁冠南不仅没有任何收敛，反而变本加厉，在今年六月四日竟敢伙同该使馆三等秘书维杰偷拍我军事禁区照片，被我解放军当场拿获。事实证明，鲁冠南完完全全是一个披着外交官外衣的间谍分子。中国政府对于印度驻华大使馆人员这种明目张胆的间谍活动极为愤慨，已向印度政府提出最强烈的抗议。中国司法机关亦已判处鲁冠南为间谍犯，即日将其押解出境。同时，中国外交部已宣布维杰为不受欢迎的人，限期离开中国国境。
    印度驻华大使馆人员在我国无产阶级文化大革命期间加紧进行窃取我国情报的活动，绝不是一个偶然的、孤立的事件。
    由我国人民伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的梦想，而且开辟了无产阶级社会主义世界革命的新时代。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派预感到它们的末日临近了，但是并不甘心自己的失败，它们还要作最后的挣扎，掀起一个又一个的反华浪潮，疯狂反对和恶毒攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命。为此，它们指使帝、修、反驻华机构的人员和记者不择手段地进行各种非法活动，千方百计地窃取我政治、军事、经济情报，搜集反华宣传子弹。
    这些外国反动分子，出自反华的需要，别有用心地到处乱钻，偷拍、偷抄和偷窃大字报；用各种阴谋手段大量搜集我各革命群众组织出版的报纸、刊物、小册子和传单等材料；冒充对我友好国家人员向我国群众刺探内部情况；冒充中国人潜入我机关、团体、学校和企业单位，甚至非法超越外国人旅行区偷拍我禁区照片等等，罪行累累不一而足。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗正在胜利地进行着无产阶级文化大革命的我国红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，多次当场抓住这些正在窃取我国情报的黑手，给予严厉警告。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”这一小撮外国反动分子窃取我国情报的活动不但丝毫没有收敛，反而越来越猖狂。他们是地地道道的赌棍，不把老本输得精光，他们是绝对不会罢休的。
    我们要严正警告这些外国反动分子：中国政府和中国广大的革命群众决不容许你们在中国领土上进行危害我国国家利益的活动，你们必须遵守我国的法令，尊重我国的革命秩序，停止你们的一切非法活动。否则，由此而引起的一切严重后果，将由你们自己承担。印度驻华使馆二等秘书鲁冠南和三等秘书维杰就是你们的前车之鉴。
