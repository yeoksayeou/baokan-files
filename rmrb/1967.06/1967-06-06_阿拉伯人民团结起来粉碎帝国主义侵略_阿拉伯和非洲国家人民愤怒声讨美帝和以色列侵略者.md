Facing the war provocations by U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, against the Arab people, the Arab and some African countries' people continue to hold rallies and demonstrations, angrily denouncing the U.S. imperialism's aggression plots and expressing resolute support for the Arab people's just struggle.

The Arab Transport Workers' Union held an executive committee meeting in Cairo on the 4th and issued a statement fully supporting all measures taken by Arab countries to smash Zionism and stop U.S. imperialism's aggression.

The statement reaffirmed support for the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Palestinian nationalists within Israel's borders, and for the struggle of the people of occupied South Yemen.

The statement called on all transport workers in Arab countries to actively participate in this serious struggle.

The Arab Petroleum Workers' Conference held a meeting in Cairo on the 3rd to discuss the role of petroleum workers in the struggle against Zionism and imperialism. The meeting called on Arab countries to immediately nationalize imperialist oil companies when any Arab country is invaded.

The statement urged petroleum workers in Saudi Arabia and Libya to take timely measures to stop imperialism from using its military bases in these countries to supply weapons to Israel, and to be vigilant against these bases being used to launch aggression against Arab countries.

The Somali General Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement in Mogadishu on the 3rd saying: "It is time to send Israel, which has always been supported by imperialism and caused anger in the Middle East, to the eighteenth level of hell, and let the Palestinian people return to their rightful homes."

The statement said that whether the United States strengthens its military power in the Mediterranean or Britain uses its military bases in South Arabia, it will not save imperialism's doomed fate in the Middle East.

The Sudanese people have continued to hold rallies and demonstrations in recent days, opposing U.S. imperialism and Israel's aggression plots against the Arab people. On the 3rd, a large rally was held in Atbara, Northern Province, expressing support for the Arab people's struggle. In Gadarif, Kassala Province, 20,000 Sudanese people held a demonstration, chanting slogans against imperialism and Israeli aggression. Similar demonstrations were also held in Sennar, Blue Nile Province, Nyala, Darfur Province, and Obeid, Kordofan Province.
