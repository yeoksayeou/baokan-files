	The editorial board notes: The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, represented by Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin, has for many years relentlessly promoted bourgeois ideology and instilled extreme selfishness and a bourgeois worldview in the Soviet people. They aim to deeply ingrain the most decadent and reactionary philosophy of "every man for himself, devil take the hindmost" into the hearts of the Soviet people, corrupting them, undermining social morality, and cultivating bourgeois successors. This is a crucial aspect of their comprehensive restoration of capitalism and a means to maintain the revisionist clique's rule in the Soviet Union.

	Under the poisonous influence of extreme individualism, a person can save only their own piglet while allowing three neighboring children to burn to death.

	In the wave of capitalist "profit principles," a lifeguard station can, due to "economic accounting," watch a drowning person struggle in the water and refuse to save them.

	Soviet youth poisoned by revisionism see the pursuit of money and pleasure as the purpose and "highest ideal" of life, and view violence and fighting as "entertainment."

	All of this should be blamed on the corruption and destruction inflicted by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union has brought immense disasters to the Soviet people.

	What is published here are only one or two social aspects revealed by Soviet revisionist newspapers. However, from these materials, one can see the heinous crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique against the Soviet people!

	The broad Soviet people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, are resisting and opposing the corruption and poisoning of revisionism. The revolutionary spirit of the Soviet working people is indestructible. They will one day rise up to overthrow the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

	The fate of the three children reveals what?

	The Soviet revisionist leadership is spreading capitalist winds, causing bourgeois ideas of harming others for personal gain to rampantly spread in the Soviet Union. A report published in last November's *Izvestia* about a fire incident shows the moral degradation of Soviet society under the rule of the revisionists.

	In a wooden house at 20 Erchisi Street in Khabarovsk, there were four households. One family's mother had passed away, and the father, Levkin, often drank and did not return home at night, leaving three lonely children.

	One night, the house caught fire. The three children woke up first. They shouted and banged on the walls, waking up the other families.

	*Izvestia* reported, "Many people rushed to put out the fire... Then the firefighters arrived. Such houses catch fire quickly, especially in the wind." However, "the other three families almost took out all their belongings: sofas, beds, small wardrobes, tables, televisions, clothes, shoes." But the three children who first discovered the fire and woke up the neighbors? Because no one went to save them, "they were suffocated by smoke and died." The conversations of several neighbors reported by *Izvestia* and their behavior during the fire explain why such a tragedy occurred.

	A man named Lukyanov said: "I was awakened by the knocking from next door. I woke up my wife and immediately started saving our children. My wife took our son and ran out, and I pushed our daughter out the window. But she came back to get the television." Someone asked him: "Did you lose anything?" He said: "Basically, nothing." In fact, they even did not miss the potatoes, all were taken out.

	At that time, the mistress of this family, after taking the little girl and rushing out, when the firefighters asked her what to save, she cried out: "Help take out the things!" "Please find my shoes!" "Catch the piglet!" But she did not ask anyone to save the neighbor's children.

	Another man named Stablovsky said: "At first, I heard knocking on the wall and indistinct children's cries. Later, several children knocked on our wall and shouted: 'Fire!' I put on my clothes and ran out, seeing our house on fire, and shouted that Levkin's house had children. I came back to wake up my wife, hugged the children, took the clothes from the rack, and ran out. At that time, it was already impossible to go back in to save the children because the flames were coming out of the broken windows. Then the whole house was engulfed in flames. It looked truly horrifying, and I felt chilled to the bone."

	Another family's Kvashnin said: "I barely threw out my four children. When we ran out, the whole house was on fire, and Lukyanov's family was standing by their pile of things, still holding a piglet. They were all dressed up."

	Because everyone was busy saving their own belongings, Levkin's children were burned to death.

    三个孩子的结果说明了什么？
    编者按：以赫鲁晓夫及其继承人勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为代表的苏修统治集团，多年来，竭力宣扬资产阶级的意识形态，向苏联人民灌输极端自私自利的资产阶级世界观。他们要把那种“人不为己，天诛地灭”的最腐朽最反动的人生哲学，深深地烙在苏联人民的心上，毒害苏联人民，败坏社会道德风气，培养资产阶级的接班人。他们这样做，是全面复辟资本主义的一个重要方面，是为了维护修正主义集团在苏联的统治。
    在极端个人主义思想的毒害下，一个人可以只顾抢救自己的一头小猪崽，而任凭邻居三个孩子活活烧死。
    在资本主义“利润原则”统帅一切的浪潮中，一个救生站可以因为“经济核算”，眼看着落水的人在水里挣扎，见死不救。
    那些受到修正主义毒害的苏联青年，把追求金钱、享乐当成了生活的目的和“最高理想”，把行凶打架当成了“乐趣”。
    所有这一切，都应该归罪于苏修统治集团对人们的腐蚀和摧残。苏联修正主义统治集团在苏联大搞资本主义复辟，给苏联人民带来了深重的灾难。
    这里发表的只是苏修报纸透露出来的一、二个社会侧面。但人们从这些材料里，也可以看到苏修统治集团对苏联人民犯下了何等的罪过！
    具有光荣革命传统的广大苏联人民，正在抵制和反对修正主义的腐蚀和毒害。苏联劳动人民的革命精神，是磨灭不了的。他们终有一天要起来造苏修统治集团的反。
    三个孩子的结果说明了什么？
    苏修领导集团大刮资本主义的阴风，使资产阶级损人利己的思想在苏联大肆泛滥。去年十一月苏联《消息报》发表的一篇关于火灾的报道，说明在苏修统治下的苏联今天的社会道德已经堕落到了什么地步。
    在哈巴罗夫斯克额尔齐斯街二十号，有一所用木板装配起来的房子。其中住着四户人家。有一家母亲去世了，父亲列夫金喝了酒经常不回家过夜，只留下三个孤零零的孩子。
    一天夜间，屋子着火了，首先惊醒的是三个孩子。他们喊了起来，敲墙壁，惊醒了另外几家的人。
    《消息报》说，“许多人跑来救火……接着消防队员也来了。这种房子着火，特别是有风的时候，真是几分钟的事”。可是“那三家仍然几乎把全部东西都搬出来了：沙发、床、小衣柜、桌子、电视机、衣服、鞋子”。但是那首先发现火警并把邻居叫醒的三个孩子呢？因为没有人去抢救，“却被烟呛死了”。《消息报》报道的几家邻居的谈话以及他们在失火中的表现，说明了为什么会造成这样的悲剧。
    一个名叫卢克扬采夫的说：“我给隔壁的敲打声弄醒了。我叫醒了妻子，立刻就开始救自己的孩子。妻子带着儿子跑出去了，我把女儿从窗子里推了出去。可是她又回来拿电视机。”有人问他：“你的东西丢了什么吗？”他说：“基本上没有丢什么”。实际上，他家连马铃薯都没有漏掉，全被抢出来了。
    当时，这一家的主妇带着小女孩赶忙逃了出来以后，当救火的人问她有什么要抢救时，她哭哭啼啼地喊着：“请帮忙把东西搬出来！”“请你们把皮鞋找出来！”“把猪崽捉出来！”可就是没有请人去抢救邻居的孩子。
    另一个叫斯塔勃罗夫斯基的说：“起初我听到有敲墙的声音和听不清楚的孩子的叫喊声，后来，几个孩子又敲我们的墙喊道：着火啦！我穿好衣服跑出来，看见我们的房子烧起来了，就大喊列夫金家里有孩子。我回来叫醒了妻子，抱住孩子，从衣架上取下衣服，就跑出来了。这时候要想再进去救孩子是已经不可能了，因为火焰开始从破窗子里冲出来。然后整个屋子都被火吞没了。看上去真可怕，我感到毛骨悚然”。
    另一家的克瓦什宁说：“我好不容易把我的四个孩子抛了出去。当我们跑出来了以后，整个屋子都烧着了，而卢克扬采夫家站在他们的一堆东西旁边，还抱着一头小猪崽。他们都穿好了衣服。”
    因为大家都抢着救自己的东西，列夫金的几个孩子就活活地葬送了。
