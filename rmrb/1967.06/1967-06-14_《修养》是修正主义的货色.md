Title: "Cultivation" is a Product of Revisionism

The editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily* have written excellent articles criticizing "Cultivation." They have pointed out the crux of the matter: "Cultivation" betrays proletarian dictatorship.

"Cultivation" devotes many pages to discussing the issue of "realizing communism." It completely abandons dialectical materialism and historical materialism, portraying a communist society as one without any contradictions, changes, or development. How to realize communism? It neither discusses armed seizure of power nor mentions proletarian dictatorship, but vaguely talks about "long-term socialist transformation." Even when quoting Lenin, it intentionally omits references to proletarian dictatorship. All of this clearly shows that the author of "Cultivation" has a complete ideological system: to reject proletarian dictatorship and pursue "communist causes." This is a thorough betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and it is sheer revisionism.

As early as 1949, on the eve of the nation's liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide, there will still be contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie within the country, and imperialism will still exist abroad. 'Because of this, the state power of the people's republic led by the working class, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, should not be weakened but must be strengthened.'"

In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao said: "'You want to abolish state power, don't you?' We do, but we do not want it now, and we cannot want it now. Why? Because imperialism still exists, domestic reactionaries still exist, and classes still exist within the country. Our current task is to strengthen the state machine of the people." He also pointed out that this is the condition for us "to advance from the new democratic society to the socialist society and the communist society."

It is precisely because we follow Chairman Mao's teachings and continuously strengthen proletarian dictatorship that we have achieved the great victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, foiled the imperialist aggression and subversion activities, consolidated national defense, and made the young People's Republic of China stand firmly in the world.

It is precisely because we continuously strengthen proletarian dictatorship that we have been able to suppress the resistance and sabotage of domestic class enemies, repeatedly repel the arrogant attacks of the bourgeoisie, and thus rapidly complete the socialist revolution on the economic front, establishing a socialist public ownership society.

After the basic completion of socialist transformation in the ownership system, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party impatiently put forward their theory of "extinction of class struggle." They falsely claim that "the main classes and class struggles within the country have basically ended. That is to say, the contradictions between enemies and us have basically been resolved." They also falsely claim that the dictatorial tasks of the state apparatus "are decreasing rather than increasing," and that "the state dictatorial organs can be reduced."

These reactionary fallacies are in resonance with Khrushchev's claim that "proletarian dictatorship is no longer necessary in the Soviet Union."

Lenin said: "The transition from capitalism to communism is a whole historical epoch. As long as this epoch has not ended, the exploiters will inevitably have the hope of restoration and will turn this hope into restoration actions." The overthrown exploiting classes will not accept defeat. They will struggle tenaciously with tenfold effort and a hundredfold hatred, dreaming of restoring their lost "paradise."

The large number of facts exposed now tell us that over the past decade, in the ideological front, whether in the fields of philosophy, history, economics, education, or literature and art, there has been extremely sharp and intense class struggle.

Dialectical materialism acknowledges that ideas play a decisive role under certain conditions. We must thoroughly criticize old ideas and old culture, and establish new ideas and new culture. We must firmly uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we develop the socialist economy.

Although the landlord and bourgeois classes have lost political power and the means of exploitation, they still have influence in the ideological and cultural realms. For thousands of years, the old ideas and old culture of the exploiting classes have dominated. The landlord and bourgeois classes have used these positions to corrupt the broad masses of the people. The reactionary comprador intellectual Hu Shi once advised imperialism: "To conquer China, one must first conquer the hearts of the Chinese people." After liberation, over the past decade, representatives of the bourgeoisie and reactionary academic "authorities" have spread a large amount of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes in the ideological and cultural realms. They write novels, scripts, and so-called "academic papers," engaging in anti-party and anti-socialist criminal activities; they have released a large number of poisonous weeds, including the book "Cultivation" by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, all aiming to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, attempting to "conquer hearts" and overthrow proletarian dictatorship to achieve capitalist restoration. Therefore, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the resistance of the bourgeoisie in the ideological and cultural realms, as Lenin said, is the "deepest and most intense." We must not take this lightly.

To deal with and defeat the bourgeoisie's resistance, we must strengthen proletarian dictatorship. There is no other way. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has been spreading the reactionary fallacy that the tasks of proletarian dictatorship are "decreasing rather than increasing," using this to lull us into complacency and attempting to disarm us ideologically, so that they can turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. Together with the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists they support, they have concocted a large number of counter-revolutionary poisonous weeds in the ideological and cultural realms, ferociously attacking the Party and socialism. When these poisonous weeds are exposed by the revolutionary masses and need to be criticized, they use every means to protect them; they confuse right and wrong, distort black and white, relying on the power they have usurped, to practice dictatorship over the revolutionary masses. The infamous "Work Report Outline" is a typical example.

The class struggle in the ideological and cultural realms is all political struggle, which ultimately comes down to the issue of power. The bourgeoisie's ferocious attacks in the ideological and cultural front are aimed at achieving capitalist restoration and overthrowing proletarian dictatorship; the proletariat's resolute repulsion of their counter-revolutionary restoration is aimed at consolidating and strengthening proletarian dictatorship. To thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois ideas in the ideological and cultural realms and seize leadership in these realms, we must simultaneously criticize the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party and government, seize their power, remove their positions, and practice proletarian dictatorship over them.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country shows that only under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, with the proletariat holding a powerful dictatorial apparatus, especially with a powerful People's Liberation Army, can we launch this unprecedented, world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only in this way can we thoroughly overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, criticize reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities," criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, and cleanse all the mud and dirt left over from the old society. Only in this way can we consolidate proletarian dictatorship and greatly strengthen it.

Throughout the entire socialist period, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will not cease. Imperialism still exists abroad; the overthrown landlord and bourgeois classes within the country are not reconciled to defeat, and they still have countless connections with international imperialism, continuing to struggle tenaciously with the proletariat; small producers will continue to produce new capitalists and bourgeoisie; in the Party and government cadres, due to the corrupting influence of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, there will still be some degenerates and new bourgeois elements, especially those who have usurped leadership positions within the Party, the handful of capitalist-roaders, who are the most dangerous enemies. The contradictions between the proletariat and them are the main contradictions throughout the period of proletarian dictatorship. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is long-term, repeated, tortuous, and complex. This class struggle may take different forms; if the bourgeoisie fails in one form, they will change to another form and come back. This class struggle is like waves, rising and falling, sometimes relatively mild, sometimes very intense.

We must remember Chairman Mao's recent teachings: the victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, capitalist restoration may happen at any time. All Party members and the people of the entire country must not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will bring eternal peace. We must be vigilant and never let our guard down.

We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and only then can we ultimately resolve the issue of the revolution's victory or defeat and realize communism throughout the world.

### 《修养》是修正主义的货色

    《修养》是修正主义的货色
    丁小昭
    《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部所写的批判《修养》的文章多么好啊！它一针见血地指出了《修养》的要害是背叛无产阶级专政。
    《修养》用了许多篇幅空谈“实现共产主义”的问题。它完全抛弃了辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，把共产主义社会说成是没有一点矛盾，没有变化，没有发展的社会。怎样实现共产主义呢？它既不谈武装夺取政权，又闭口不谈无产阶级专政，只是笼笼统统地讲什么“长时期地进行社会主义改造”；甚至在引用列宁的话时，也一而再地特意剜掉无产阶级专政。这一切都确凿地说明：《修养》的作者有一个完整的思想体系，就是不要无产阶级专政，去“进行共产主义事业”。这是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大背叛，是彻头彻尾的修正主义。
    早在一九四九年全国解放前夕，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出：中国革命在全国胜利以后，国内还有工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，国外还有帝国主义存在。“因为这样，工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。”
    毛主席在《论人民民主专政》中说：“‘你们不是要消灭国家权力吗？’我们要，但是我们现在还不要，我们现在还不能要。为什么？帝国主义还存在，国内反动派还存在，国内阶级还存在。我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器”。并且指出，这是使我们“由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会和共产主义社会”的条件。
    正是因为我们遵循毛主席的教导，不断地加强无产阶级专政，所以我们能够取得抗美援朝的伟大胜利，粉碎帝国主义的侵略和颠覆活动，巩固国防，使年青的中华人民共和国英勇坚强地屹立于世界。
    正是因为我们不断地加强无产阶级专政，所以我们能够镇压国内阶级敌人的反抗和破坏，一次又一次地打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，从而在经济战线上迅速地完成社会主义革命，建立起社会主义公有制的社会。
    在所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成之后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就迫不及待地抛出他的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。他胡说什么“国内的主要阶级和阶级斗争已经基本上结束了。那就是说，敌我矛盾已经基本解决了”。并胡说，国家机构的专政任务“愈来愈少了，不是愈来愈大了”，“国家专政的机构可以缩小了”。
    这种反动谬论，和赫鲁晓夫宣称的“无产阶级专政在苏联已经不再是必要的了”，是遥相呼应的。
    列宁说：“从资本主义过渡到共产主义是一整个历史时代。只要这个时代没有结束，剥削者就必然存在着复辟希望，并把这种希望变为复辟行动。”被推翻了的剥削阶级是不甘心失败的，他们必然会以十倍的努力，百倍的仇恨来拚命斗争，梦想恢复失去的“天堂”。
    现在揭发出来的大量事实告诉我们，这十多年来，我国思想战线上，无论是哲学、历史、经济、教育和文学艺术各个领域中，都出现了非常尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。
    辩证唯物论承认思想在一定条件下起决定作用。我们一定要大破旧思想、旧文化，大立新思想、新文化，一定要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这样，才能发展社会主义的经济。
    地主资产阶级虽然丧失了政权，丧失了剥削阶级私有制，但是，他们在思想文化领域内还是有力量的。几千年来，剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化长期占据统治地位，地主资产阶级极力利用这些阵地，腐蚀广大的人民群众。反动的买办知识分子胡适曾向帝国主义献过策：“要征服中国，必先征服中国人的心。”解放后十多年来，资产阶级代表人物和反动学术“权威”，在思想文化领域中，大量散布剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。他们写小说，写剧本，写所谓“学术论文”，进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动；他们放出了大批毒草，包括党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的这本《修养》在内，都是要制造反革命舆论，妄图“征服人心”，颠覆无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。因此，在无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级在思想文化方面进行的反抗，正象列宁所说，是“最深刻、最强烈”的。我们切切不可等闲视之。
    要对付资产阶级这种反抗，并战胜它，就必须加强无产阶级专政，舍此没有第二条路。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却大肆散布无产阶级专政任务已经“愈来愈少了，不是愈来愈大了”的反动谬论，以此来麻痹我们，企图解除我们的思想武装，以便他变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。他和他所支持的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在思想文化领域内炮制了一大批反革命的毒草，猖狂地向党向社会主义进攻。这些毒草一旦被革命群众揪住，要进行批判的时候，他们又千方百计地加以保护；他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，仗着他们窃取的权力，对革命群众实行专政。臭名昭著的《汇报提纲》就是这样一个活标本。
    在思想文化领域内的阶级斗争都是政治斗争，归结到一点，就是政权问题。资产阶级在思想文化战线上猖狂进攻，是为了要实现资本主义复辟，推翻无产阶级专政；无产阶级坚决打退他们的反革命复辟，正是为了巩固和加强无产阶级专政。要彻底批判思想文化领域中的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些领域内的领导权，就必须同时批判混进党政各界里的资产阶级代表人物，夺他们的权，罢他们的官，对他们实行无产阶级专政。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的实践表明，只有在无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级掌握了强大的专政机构，特别是有了强大的人民解放军，才有可能发动这场史无前例的、震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。才能彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，批判反动的资产阶级学术“权威”，批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，改造一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，荡涤一切旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。才能够巩固无产阶级专政，大大地加强无产阶级专政。
    在整个社会主义阶段，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争是不会停息的。国外帝国主义还存在；国内被推翻了的地主资产阶级并不甘心失败，他们同国际帝国主义还有千丝万缕的联系，还要顽强地和无产阶级继续较量；小生产者还会不断地产生出新的资本主义和资产阶级；在党政机关干部中，由于资产阶级糖衣炮弹的腐蚀作用，还会产生一些蜕化变质分子和新的资产阶级分子，特别是那些窃踞领导地位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是最危险的敌人。无产阶级同他们之间的矛盾，是整个无产阶级专政时期的主要矛盾。无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争是长期的、反复的、曲折的、复杂的。这种阶级斗争可能采取不同的形式，资产阶级用这种形式遭到了失败，他们会变换另一种形式，卷土重来。这种阶级斗争象波浪起伏一样，高一阵，低一阵，有时比较缓和，有时十分激烈。
    我们要牢记毛主席最近的教导：革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
    我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，不断加强无产阶级专政，才能最后解决革命的谁胜谁负的问题，才能在全世界实现共产主义。
