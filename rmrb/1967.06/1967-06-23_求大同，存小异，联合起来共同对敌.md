As we celebrate the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, it is of great significance to solemnly commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the May 16th Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, Chairman Mao pointed out to us that the main target of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. We must expose them, criticize them, overthrow them, and carry out the struggle to seize power. This is the main task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the correct direction of our struggle as proletarian revolutionaries. To accomplish this great and arduous historical task, we absolutely must have the iron wall-like great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and a strong revolutionary army that fights shoulder to shoulder and with one heart!

However, in the past, because we did not seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, we did not learn well how to correctly handle the two types of contradictions, and we did not grasp the correct direction of struggle, we were therefore unable to properly handle the relationships between the two organizations, leading to mutual opposition and constant "internal wars." The continuation of this situation made us increasingly feel that without achieving revolutionary great unity, we cannot fully mobilize the masses, we cannot smoothly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and we cannot achieve thorough liberation of a large area and a fierce attack on a small handful.

Through the study of the brilliant work of our great leader Chairman Mao, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the Jǐngāngshān Commune and the Dōngfānghóng Commune of our school have decided to act according to Chairman Mao's great teachings. We must see that the common enemy of the proletarian revolutionaries is the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Our contradictions with them are antagonistic contradictions. In the face of this main contradiction and this common enemy, the only correct path for us proletarian revolutionaries is: unite! Combine forces! Concentrate our strength to launch a fierce attack on the common enemy—the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party! This is the direction of the struggle, this is the overriding task, this is the overriding principle. If we forget about the class enemy, forget about the irreconcilable class contradictions, and focus all our energy on the contradictions between revolutionary organizations, we will deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, deviate from the direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and may even be used by the class enemy, making us become historical figures that bloom for a moment and then fade away, causing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to fail halfway.

The proletarian revolutionaries of our school must listen to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and take "great unity, great criticism, great struggle" as our battle slogan. The two revolutionary organizations will immediately stop all forms of mutual attacks and actively create conditions for achieving revolutionary great unity. The urgent task at hand is for the two organizations to cooperate and immediately launch a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in our school. On this basis, we will carry out rectification, conduct more self-criticism, seize the power of the "self" in our minds, overthrow the "self," break down all bad thoughts that obstruct great unity, and solve the existing differences between the two sides according to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity" proposed by Chairman Mao. For issues that cannot be unified for the time being, we will follow the principle of "seeking common ground while reserving differences," and "subordinate small principles to big principles," unite as one, and fight the enemy together.

The proletarian revolutionaries of our school have such courage and breadth! Since we have fought our way out of the white terror together, since we have fought side by side in class struggles, since we have grown and flourished together under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought, then today, in the face of the common class enemy, we will definitely be able to quickly unite! Unite! Become a model of revolutionary great unity, and advance bravely along the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao! Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    求大同，存小异，联合起来共同对敌
    北京师范学院  井冈山公社  东方红公社
    在我们欢呼一年来无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的日子里，隆重纪念毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部伟大著作发表十周年，有着极为重大的现实意义。
    在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》这两部伟大的文献中，毛主席向我们指出了无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们揪出来，斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，对他们进行夺权斗争，就是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要问题。就是我们无产阶级革命派斗争的大方向。要完成这个伟大而艰巨的历史任务，没有我们无产阶级革命派的铜墙铁壁般的革命大联合，没有一支并肩携手、同心协力的坚强革命大军是绝对办不到的！！
    但是，过去由于我们没有认真活学活用毛主席著作，没有很好地学会正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，斗争大方向掌握得不够牢，因此也就不能很好地处理两个组织间的关系，造成双方的对立，“内战”不断。这种局面的延续，越来越使我们感到，不实现革命的大联合，就不可能充分发动群众，就不可能顺利进行斗、批、改，就不可能做到彻底解放一大片，狠狠打击一小撮。
    通过学习伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，我们师院井冈山公社和东方红公社决心按照毛主席的伟大教导去做。我们必须看到无产阶级革命派的共同敌人是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们同他们的矛盾是敌我矛盾，对抗性矛盾，在这样一个主要矛盾和这样一个共同敌人面前，我们无产阶级革命派唯一正确的道路，就是：团结起来！联合起来！集中力量向共同的敌人——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火！这就是斗争的大方向，这就是压倒一切的中心任务，就是压倒一切的大道理。如果我们忘记了阶级敌人，忘记了不可调和的阶级矛盾，而把全部精力集注到革命组织之间的矛盾上，就会背离毛主席的革命路线，背离无产阶级文化大革命的大方向，甚至会被阶级敌人所利用，使我们自己成为历史上昙花一现的人物，使文化大革命事业半途而废。
    我们师院无产阶级革命派一定要听党中央、毛主席的话，把“大联合、大批判、大斗争”作为我们的战斗纲领。我们两大革命组织，坚决立即停止一切形式的互相攻击，为实现革命的大联合积极创造条件。当务之急是两个组织共同合作，立即在我院掀起一个活学活用毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的高潮，在这个基础上，进行整风，多作自我批评，夺头脑中“私”字的权，革“私”字的命，大破阻碍大联合的各种坏思想，对双方存在的分歧本着毛主席提出的“团结——批评——团结”的原则，进行解决，对于一时不能统一的问题要本着识大体、顾大局，小道理服从大道理的原则，求大同，存小异，团结一致，共同对敌。
    我们师院无产阶级革命派有这样的气魄和胸怀！我们既然能从白色恐怖中共同杀出来，我们既然在阶级搏斗中并肩战斗，我们既然共同在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露的哺育下成长壮大，那么今天在共同的阶级敌人面前，我们也一定能够迅速联合起来！团结起来！誓做革命大联合的模范，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，奋勇前进！把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
