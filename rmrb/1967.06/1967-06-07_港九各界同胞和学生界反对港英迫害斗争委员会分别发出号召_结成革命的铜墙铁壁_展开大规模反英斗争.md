The Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Persecution and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Committee Against British Persecution issued calls on June 4th, urging the formation of a revolutionary iron wall and the launch of large-scale anti-British struggles.

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on June 6th, the spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Persecution and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Committee Against British Persecution issued statements and declarations respectively. They resolutely supported the editorial "Firmly Resist British Imperialism's Provocations" published in the People's Daily. They pointed out that this is the most affectionate concern and greatest support from the great socialist motherland for the anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggles of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They solemnly declared that they would march forward in the direction of struggle indicated by the editorial, mobilize and organize the broad masses, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the great motherland to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

The spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Persecution said: "Just as we are preparing to firmly resist the mad provocations of the Hong Kong British authorities, the people of our motherland have once again issued a powerful voice. This editorial guides us towards the path of victory. We believe that this editorial is a battle cry from the great people of our motherland armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also an action program for the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to fight against persecution. Therefore, we call on the anti-persecution struggle committees of various associations and organizations, and patriotic compatriots from all walks of life, to seriously study the guiding spirit of this editorial, propagate it widely, and resolutely implement it."

The spokesperson called on the compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon: We must fully expose and vigorously propagate that British imperialism is the evil ruler of Hong Kong, and launch all movements of hatred, contempt, and ridicule against British imperialism; we must fully expose and vigorously propagate the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong over the past more than a hundred years, expose them deeply and thoroughly; mobilize the masses to make blood-curdling accusations, make them known to every household, form a vast anti-persecution army, and create a revolutionary iron wall; we must organize the broad masses, form a large-scale anti-British and anti-violence movement, and the anti-persecution struggle committees of various associations and units should hold oath-taking rallies, mobilize compatriots from all strata to launch a fierce struggle, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong. The spokesperson finally emphasized: The compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon must hold high the great red flag of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness of sacrifice, and march forward bravely. Victory will surely be ours.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Committee Against British Persecution issued a declaration, welcoming the editorial of the People's Daily, which pointed out the direction of the struggle for the youth student movement to combine with the workers' movement. The declaration said: At present, the anti-violence struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon is going very well! A vast revolutionary army composed of workers, peasants, young students, and patriotic compatriots from all walks of life is rapidly forming. We young students are a daring and adventurous youth brigade of this revolutionary army. We must learn from the workers uncles who are fighting on the front lines, learn their revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, and resolutely carry out the instructions of our greatest leader Chairman Mao: "Be determined, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory."

The declaration announced: The students of Hong Kong and Kowloon have sounded the death knell for the Hong Kong British authorities. With our greatest leader Chairman Mao as our backbone, with the support of 700 million people of our motherland, and with the support of millions of Red Guards of our motherland, we will definitely carry out this anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle to the end! The British will be defeated! We will be victorious!

In recent days, workers, students, and members of various unions, schools, and associations in Hong Kong have held oath-taking rallies, expressing their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.
