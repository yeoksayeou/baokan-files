The United States imperialists have recently dispatched a large number of warships to the Middle East, threatening the Arab people and supporting the Israeli aggressors.

The Soviet revisionists have also sent some warships to cruise around in the Mediterranean, claiming to support the Arab countries in opposing Israeli aggression.

However, when American warships encounter Soviet revisionist warships on the sea, instead of showing any signs of hostility, they wave to each other in a very friendly manner.

This can be called a normal abnormal phenomenon. Because the United States imperialists' support for Israel is genuine, while the Soviet revisionists' support for the Arab countries is false. Where is the enmity between the two?

Regarding the situation in the Middle East, their goals are the same. The United States supports Israel to extinguish the anti-American fury of the Arab people; in its own words, this is called "solving the Middle East crisis." The Soviet revisionists' "support" for the Arab countries is to suppress their opposition to Israeli aggression; in its own words, this is called "calming down the tense situation in the Middle East." Now, both the United States and the Soviet Union have dispatched fleets to the Middle East to engage in activities, is this not a "joint action" under the same goal? Is this not a step in their conspiracy to jointly dominate the world?

Of course, the Soviet revisionists do not admit this. They want to be both a prostitute and a madam. They strive to portray themselves as friends of the Arab people. However, what spoils the scene is that the Soviet revisionists' dirty secrets have been exposed by the American sailors on the warships. Regrettable, regrettable!

    正常的“怪现象”
    美帝国主义最近派了大批军舰到中东地区去，恫吓阿拉伯人民，支持以色列侵略者。
    苏修集团也出动一些军舰在地中海面上游来荡去，说是支持阿拉伯国家反对以色列侵略。
    但是，当美国军舰同苏修军舰在海面上相遇的时候，双方却毫无剑拔弩张的架势，而是挥手致意，煞是亲热。
    这可以说是一种正常的怪现象。因为美帝国主义支持以色列是真的，而苏修集团支持阿拉伯国家是假的。两家那儿来的敌意呢？
    对于中东局势，它们的目标是一致的。美帝支持以色列是为了扑灭阿拉伯人民的反美怒火，用它自己的话来说，叫做“解决中东危机”；而苏修“支持”阿拉伯国家则是为了抑制它们反对以色列的侵略，用它自己的话来说，叫做“使中东的紧张局势平静下来”。现在美苏双方出动舰队到中东地区去活动，不正是在这个一致目标下采取的“联合行动”，不正是它们推行美苏合作主宰世界阴谋的一个步骤吗？
    当然，苏修集团是不肯承认这一点的。他们又想做婊子，又想立牌坊。他们竭力要把自己装扮成为阿拉伯人民的朋友。然而，大煞风景的是，苏修集团这种见不得人的底细，却给美国军舰上的水兵抖落了出来。遗憾，遗憾！
