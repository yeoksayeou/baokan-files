The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has received a congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand on the success of China's first hydrogen bomb test. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the Dear Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand, on behalf of all party members and the revolutionary people of Thailand, extends the warmest congratulations to the People's Republic of China on the successful testing of its first hydrogen bomb on June 17, 1967, on Chinese soil.

Under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the outstanding soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, workers, engineering and technical personnel, and scientific workers have achieved this brilliant success in hydrogen bomb testing. This marks a great leap in China's development of nuclear weapons and signifies the entry of Chinese science and technology into a new stage. It demonstrates the mighty power of China's national defense and also shows that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can create miracles for their motherland and make contributions to the liberation cause of the oppressed peoples of the world.

In less than three years, the People's Republic of China has tested nuclear weapons, missiles, and hydrogen bombs, achieving great successes. These achievements once again prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This is the great victory of Marxism-Leninism at the peak of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory—the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It is also a glorious victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

We feel proud that our closest comrades-in-arms, the Chinese people, have succeeded in testing the hydrogen bomb. This achievement is as much ours as it is theirs. The oppressed peoples of the world will undoubtedly regard this achievement as theirs and feel proud of it. The explosion of this hydrogen bomb has become a sharp weapon for the people of the world to oppose the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism. It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world and greatly dampens the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, which seek to dominate the world, monopolize nuclear weapons, and blackmail the peoples of the world with nuclear threats.

The success of this hydrogen bomb test has made all imperialists, headed by U.S. imperialism, their accomplices the Soviet modern revisionist clique, and their running dogs, including the lackeys in Thailand, all panic-stricken. Their reckless bluster is merely a pathetic attempt at self-comfort.

The success of this hydrogen bomb test is an inspiration to the peoples of the world who are resisting imperialism and colonialism, and to the peoples who are resisting U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. For the heroic Vietnamese people who are on the front lines of the struggle; for the Arab peoples who are suffering from the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism and their tool, Israel; for the Thai people who are waging a life-and-death armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Prapas clique, which are their lackeys, to expel U.S. imperialism from Thailand and overthrow the Thanom-Prapas clique, this is a great inspiration.

The revolutionary people of Thailand and the Communist Party of Thailand are immensely delighted and inspired by the new scientific and technological achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great teacher, the reddest red sun in the hearts of the Communist Party of China and all revolutionaries of the world—Chairman Mao Zedong.

May the Chinese people continue to achieve new successes!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

With fraternal greetings,

Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand
June 23, 1967

    泰共中央祝贺我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功
    中国红色氢弹使帝修反丧魂落魄
    新华社二十八日讯　中国共产党中央委员会收到泰国共产党中央委员会写来的祝贺我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的贺信。贺信全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    泰国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体党员和泰国革命人民，对中华人民共和国一九六七年六月十七日在中国国土上试验第一颗氢弹所取得的辉煌成果，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    在光荣的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下，优秀的中国人民解放军、工人、工程技术人员和科学工作者，所进行的这次氢弹试验的成功，是中国发展核武器的大飞跃，和科学技术进入了崭新阶段的标志。它显示了中国国防力量的强大威力，同时也表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，能够为祖国创造一切奇迹，为全世界被压迫人民的解放事业作出贡献。
    在不到三年的短短时间中，中华人民共和国试验了核武器、导弹和氢弹，取得了伟大成就。这些成就再一次证明社会主义制度的无比优越性。这是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，也是中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。
    我们为泰国爱国革命人民最亲密的战友中国人民试验氢弹的成功而感到自豪。这一成就也正如我们的成就一样。全世界被压迫的人民也必然把这一成就当成他们的成就，并为此而感到自豪。这次氢弹的爆炸，成为全世界人民反对推行侵略政策和战争政策的美帝国主义的犀利的武器，它大长全世界革命人民的斗志，大灭合作主宰世界、进行核垄断和向全世界人民进行核讹诈的美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的威风。
    这次氢弹试验的成功，使以美帝国主义为首的一切帝国主义者，它的同谋者苏联现代修正主义集团以及它们的仆从走卒们包括在泰国的走狗在内，都为之丧魂落魄。他们之所以还发出一些狂妄叫嚣，只不过是聊以自慰而已。
    这次氢弹试验的成功，是对全世界正在反抗帝国主义和殖民主义的人民的鼓舞，是对正在反抗美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的人民的鼓舞。对于站在斗争最前线的英勇的越南人民；对于正在遭受美、英帝国主义及其工具以色列侵略的阿拉伯人民；对于正在进行民族民主革命，为了驱逐美帝国主义出泰国，和推翻美帝国主义奴才他侬—巴博集团，而同美帝国主义及他侬—巴博集团进行你死我活的武装斗争的泰国人民，都是极大的鼓舞。
    泰国的爱国革命人民、泰国共产党，为中国人民在中国共产党和全世界革命者心中最红最红的红太阳、伟大的导师毛泽东主席的领导下，所取得的科学技术的新成就，而感到无限欢欣鼓舞。
    祝中国人民将继续不断地取得新的成就！
    祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆！
        致以　兄弟般的敬礼！
              泰国共产党中央委员会　一九六七年六月二十三日
