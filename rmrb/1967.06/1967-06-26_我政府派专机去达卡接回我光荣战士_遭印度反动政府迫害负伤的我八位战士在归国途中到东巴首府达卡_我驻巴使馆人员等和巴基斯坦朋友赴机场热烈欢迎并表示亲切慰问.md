The Chinese government today dispatched a special plane to Dhaka to bring back the Chinese diplomatic warriors who were injured by the Indian reactionary government's instigation of mob violence.

Accompanying the special plane to welcome the injured were the responsible person from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xu Jingwu, representatives of the revolutionary rebels from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, medical personnel, and others.

Originally, the Chinese government decided on June 18 to dispatch a special plane to New Delhi to bring back the injured personnel from the Chinese Embassy for treatment in China. However, the Indian government, fearing the Chinese government's dispatch of a special plane to New Delhi, used various absurd excuses to deliberately obstruct and harass, and unreasonably refused the entry of the Chinese special plane. In order to ensure that the injured could return to China for treatment as soon as possible, the Chinese government decided to dispatch a special plane to Dhaka for the welcome.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Dhaka on June 25, eight Chinese diplomatic warriors from the Chinese Embassy in India, who were injured by the Indian reactionary government and instigated by mob violence, arrived in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, on their way back to China.

These eight Chinese red diplomatic warriors were warmly welcomed at the airport by the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, Xu Ying, the consul of the Chinese Consulate in Dhaka, Zong Ruqing, and other staff members of the Chinese Consulate General in Dhaka.

The special plane sent to escort the eight injured personnel back to China also arrived in Dhaka earlier on June 25. Xu Jingwu, the responsible person from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the revolutionary rebels from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, doctors, nurses, and the crew of the special plane also went to the airport to welcome the eight injured comrades. They all held and waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," expressing their warm concern and respect.

Many members of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in East Pakistan also went to the airport to welcome them. They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Pakistan-China friendship!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" They expressed their sympathy and respect for the brave Chinese diplomatic warriors who stood firm against the attacks of the Indian reactionaries.

Although Chen Luzhi and the others were seriously injured, they held high the portrait of Chairman Mao and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and walked down the plane with their heads held high. They were in high spirits and full of fighting spirit, expressing their gratitude to the welcoming crowd.

The most seriously injured, Wang Liren, was carried down the plane on a stretcher, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The representative of the revolutionary rebels from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented each injured comrade with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a Chairman Mao badge as the most precious gift. The staff of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan and the Chinese Consulate General in Dhaka presented them with flowers.

A welcome ceremony was held in the rest room at the Dhaka airport. The chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in East Pakistan, Hafeez, delivered a speech expressing his sympathy and greetings to the injured Chinese personnel. He said that the Indian mob, under the command of the Indian government, attacked the Chinese embassy personnel, which was a rare and shocking atrocity in international relations and a gross violation of internationally recognized laws. The Pakistani friends present shouted, "Shameful, shameful!"

Chen Luzhi, in his speech, expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome and assistance from the Pakistani friends. He briefly recounted the incident of the Indian government's orchestrated attack on the Chinese Embassy in India. He said that Chinese diplomatic warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of any violence from the enemy.

After the speeches by Hafeez and Chen Luzhi, the welcoming crowd repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Pakistan-China friendship!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" "Those who oppose China will meet a bad end!"

    我政府派专机去达卡接回我光荣战士
    遭印度反动政府迫害负伤的我八位战士在归国途中到东巴首府达卡  我驻巴使馆人员等和巴基斯坦朋友赴机场热烈欢迎并表示亲切慰问
    据新华社二十五日讯　中国政府今天派专机去达卡接回被印度反动政府唆使暴徒打伤的中国驻印度大使馆的红色外交战士。
    随同专机前往迎接的有外交部第一亚洲司负责人徐净武，外交部革命造反派代表和医护人员等。
    中国政府本来在十八日决定派民航专机前往新德里把中国大使馆受伤人员接回国内治疗，但是由于印度政府对中国政府派专机到新德里这一措施怕得要死，用种种荒唐的借口故意阻挠刁难，竟毫无道理地拒绝了中国专机入境。为了使伤员能够及早回国就医，中国政府决定派专机去达卡迎接。
    新华社达卡二十五日电　遭受印度反动政府迫害和被印度反动政府唆使暴徒打伤的中国驻印度大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直和其他七名外交战士在回国途中，二十五日乘飞机到达东巴基斯坦首府达卡。
    这八名中国红色外交战士在机场受到中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆临时代办徐英、中国驻达卡领事宗绶卿和中国驻达卡总领事馆工作人员的热烈欢迎。
    前去接运八名受伤人员回国的一架中国民航专机二十五日早些时候也到达达卡。乘这架专机来到这里的中国外交部第一亚洲司的负责人徐净武、外交部革命造反派的代表、医生、护士以及这架专机的工作人员也到机场迎接这八位受伤的同志。他们都高举并挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向八名受伤人员表示亲切慰问和敬意。
    东巴基斯坦的巴中友好协会的许多成员也都到机场欢迎。他们高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“巴中友好万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒印度反动派！”他们向在印度反动派袭击面前坚强不屈的英勇的中国外交战士表示同情和敬意。
    陈鲁直和其他同志虽然伤势很重，但他们高举毛主席像和《毛主席语录》，昂首阔步地走下飞机。他们心情愉快，斗志昂扬，向欢迎者致谢。
    伤势最重的王里仁，躺在担架上，抬下飞机，他高呼：“毛主席万岁！”中国外交部革命造反派的代表向每个受伤的同志赠送一本《毛主席语录》和一枚毛主席像章，作为最珍贵的礼物。中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆和中国驻达卡总领事馆的工作人员向他们献了花。
    在达卡机场的休息室里举行了欢迎仪式。东巴基斯坦巴中友好协会主席哈菲兹发表讲话，对受伤的中国人员表示同情和问候。他说，印度暴徒在印度政府指挥下殴打中国使馆人员，这是国际关系上罕见的骇人听闻的暴行，是对公认的国际法的粗暴破坏。在场的巴基斯坦朋友听了以后喊道：“可耻，可耻！”
    陈鲁直在讲话中表示感谢巴基斯坦朋友的热烈欢迎和帮助。他简单地叙述了印度政府策划袭击中国驻印度大使馆的事件。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国外交战士是不怕敌人的任何暴力的。
    哈菲兹和陈鲁直讲话后，欢迎者一再用中国话或孟加拉语高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”“巴中友好万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“打倒印度反动派！”“凡是反对中国的人都没有好下场！”
