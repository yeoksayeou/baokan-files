In the wake of the news that the U.S. imperialist running dog, Israel, launched an aggression war against Arab countries on June 5, the indignant people of various Arab countries took to the streets in large-scale anti-U.S. demonstrations, shouting "Down with U.S. imperialism!" In some countries, the masses even destroyed the U.S. embassies and consulates, tore the American flag to shreds, and trampled it underfoot.

Meanwhile, the Arab people expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their most resolute support in their anti-imperialist struggle. They enthusiastically shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the People's Republic of China!" in front of the Chinese embassy.

In the Iraqi capital Baghdad, thousands of Iraqis demonstrated in front of the U.S. embassy on June 5.

Another group of Iraqis demonstrated in front of the British embassy.

As the demonstrators passed by the Chinese embassy, they repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the People's Republic of China!" Chinese Deputy Charge d'Affaires Zhang Weiping waved and greeted them. He said, "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle." The enthusiastic demonstrators warmly embraced and kissed all the Chinese friends present and lifted the Chinese friends onto their shoulders. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "We are brothers!"

At the same time, the Egyptian people of the United Arab Republic enthusiastically shook hands with Chinese friends they saw and expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people. An Egyptian friend said, "Our victory today proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's wise judgment: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." A university student came to the Chinese embassy to request a copy of the "Little Red Book." He said, "I have enlisted in the army. At this moment, I yearn to read Chairman Mao's red book because it is very important for guiding our struggle."
