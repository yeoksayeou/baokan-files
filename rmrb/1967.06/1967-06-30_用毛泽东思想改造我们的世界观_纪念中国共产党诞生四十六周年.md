Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us:

"The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism."

The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China has undergone the most intense, arduous, prolonged, and complex struggles in revolutionary history, traversing a 46-year-long glorious path.

Our Party is one personally founded and nurtured by Comrade Mao Zedong, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is a proletarian revolutionary party that combines theory with practice, closely ties itself with the masses, and has a serious spirit of self-criticism.

As early as July 1949, Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "On the occasion of the Party's birthday, what is of great significance to us is to strive to learn, to arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, we can not only swiftly achieve nationwide victory but also consolidate this victory and build a new China."

Today, in the excellent situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging ahead, commemorating our Party's birthday is especially important. We must use the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—to transform our worldview and achieve new great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong has solved a series of major problems in contemporary proletarian revolution, solved the theoretical and practical problems of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. He has elevated Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

The 46-year history of our Party tells us: when we advance along the revolutionary course of Mao Zedong Thought, our cause prospers, develops, and achieves victory; when we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, our cause suffers setbacks, regresses, and fails.

We must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, unify the thinking of the people across the nation with Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and pass down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation. This is the fundamental guarantee that our proletarian state will remain red for generations to come. When the hundreds of millions of people master Mao Zedong Thought, they can prevent revisionism. Even if revisionism emerges, we can overthrow it. If the father engages in revisionism, the son will rebel against him. If the son engages in revisionism, the grandson will rebel against him. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat must transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not yet been truly resolved."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev is the political manifestation of the life-and-death struggle between these two fundamentally opposed worldviews. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie both want to transform China according to their own worldviews. One aims to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the socialist revolution through to the end; the other aims to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism.

We thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line they propose and implement. Fundamentally, this is about smashing the bourgeois worldview and establishing the proletarian worldview, which means smashing revisionism and establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has become even more widely and deeply integrated with the hundreds of millions of people, and the ideological strongholds of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie have been greatly reduced.

However, we must also recognize that our country was originally one with a large petty-bourgeois element, and petty-bourgeois ideology has a fairly broad market. In terms of its system, petty-bourgeois thought belongs to the category of the bourgeois worldview.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: we must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Overcoming petty-bourgeois thought is a very important issue. After taking power, it is especially important to pay high attention to this issue. After taking power, the position of the proletarian revolutionaries has changed, and the petty-bourgeois thoughts that still exist in our minds can easily grow and manifest. The political dust of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in society comes at us head-on, and the enemy will attack us with sugar-coated bullets. In such circumstances, if those with serious petty-bourgeois thoughts do not constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview, they will become complacent and stagnate, resting on their laurels as "old revolutionaries"; they may put on airs, speak officialese, and suppress democracy in front of the masses; they may follow the bourgeois big-shot style, show off, and boast; they may forget about the enemy, forget about class struggle, and forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Every revolutionary comrade should seriously consider: are we holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establishing a proletarian worldview, taking power for the proletariat, and carrying the revolution through to the end? Or are we letting the "self" run wild, allowing the bourgeois worldview to occupy our minds, struggling for personal or small-group fame, profit, power, and status, and pulling the revolution backward? This serious question is a new severe test for the proletarian revolutionaries in the process of seizing power and after taking power.

All words and actions of the proletarian revolutionaries must be measured against the standard of Mao Zedong Thought. This is our highest principle. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, we support and implement; whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we resist and oppose. It is based on this principle that we have rebelled against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. In this struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries have suffered blows and weathered storms because they adhere to this principle. It is also because they adhere to this principle that the proletarian revolutionaries have won the power struggle. After victory, we must also forever adhere to this principle and never violate it. All our words and actions that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought should be subject to self-criticism and should be corrected in earnest. We should allow and welcome others to criticize, resist, and oppose us, and allow and welcome the supervision of the masses. Only in this way can we correct errors in time, avoid major errors, avoid errors in direction and line, and prevent degeneration and change; only in this way can we gradually establish a proletarian worldview, truly take power for the proletariat, and truly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful."

Our comrades must work hard on transforming their worldview, overthrow the "self," and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds. Only those who are good at using class analysis and class struggle perspectives to view society and themselves, who can resolutely fight against the old things in their minds, and who can transform the objective world while transforming their subjective world in the struggle to transform the objective world, are truly hopeful people.

Our deputy helmsman Comrade Lin Biao has, over the decades, consistently, resolutely, and thoroughly executed and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He has consistently held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively applied Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's intimate comrade-in-arms and best student, and is the shining example for the entire Party and the people of the nation in actively applying Chairman Mao's works. We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. As long as we persist in doing so, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview, we will surely achieve victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve one victory after another in the socialist revolutionary cause, and consolidate and develop these victories.

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    用毛泽东思想改造我们的世界观
    ——纪念中国共产党诞生四十六周年
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：
    “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。
    指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，经历了革命历史上最激烈、最艰苦、最长期、最复杂的斗争，走过了四十六年光辉灿烂的道路。
    我们的党，是毛泽东同志亲手缔造和培育的党，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，是理论同实际相结合的、和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的、有认真的自我批评精神的无产阶级革命党。
    林彪同志早在一九四九年七月就指出：“在纪念党的生日的时候，对我们具有重大意义的就是要努力学习，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来。这样，我们不但可以迅速取得全国胜利，而且能够巩固这个胜利，建设一个新中国。”
    今天，在无产阶级文化大革命乘风破浪前进的大好形势下，纪念我们党的生日，特别重要的是，要用当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想改造我们的世界观，夺取无产阶级文化大革命新的伟大胜利。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东同志解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的重大问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    我们党四十六年的斗争史告诉我们：当我们沿着毛泽东思想的革命航道前进的时候，我们的事业就兴旺，就发展，就胜利；当违背了毛泽东思想的时候，我们的事业就遭受挫折，就倒退，就失败。
    用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，用毛泽东思想统一全国人民群众的思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，把毛泽东思想一代一代地传下去，这是我们无产阶级江山千秋万代永不变色的根本保证。亿万人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就可以防止修正主义。出了修正主义，我们也可以把它反掉。老子搞修正主义，儿子会造他的反。儿子搞修正主义，孙子会造他的反。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线之间的斗争，就是这两种根本对立的世界观的生死搏斗在政治上的集中表现。无产阶级和资产阶级都要按照自己的世界观改造中国，一个要巩固和加强无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底；一个要颠覆无产阶级专政，搞资本主义复辟。
    我们彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判他们提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线，从根本上说，就是大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，也就是大破修正主义，大立毛泽东思想。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想更加广泛、更加深入地和亿万群众结合起来了，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想阵地大大缩小了。
    但是，我们也应当看到，我国原来是一个小资产阶级成分众多的国家，小资产阶级思潮有着相当广泛的市场。小资产阶级思想，按其体系来说，属于资产阶级世界观的范畴。
    毛主席最近教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。
    克服小资产阶级思想，这是一个十分重要的问题。在掌权以后尤其要高度重视这个问题。无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，地位起了变化，我们头脑里还多少存在的小资产阶级思想很容易滋长和发作，社会上资产阶级和小资产阶级的政治灰尘迎面扑来，敌人会用糖衣裹着的炮弹向我们攻击。在这种情况下，一些小资产阶级思想严重的人，如果不经常用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，就会满足而停止不前，以“老造反”自居，吃老本；就可能在群众面前摆架子，打官腔，压制民主；就可能因袭资产阶级的大少爷作风，摆排场，讲阔气；就可能忘记了敌人，忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了无产阶级专政。
    每个革命同志都要好好地想一想：我们是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树立无产阶级世界观，为无产阶级掌好权，把革命进行到底呢？还是任“私”字泛滥，让资产阶级世界观占领自己的头脑，为个人或小团体争名，争利，争权，争地位，把革命拉向后退呢？这个严肃的问题，在夺权过程中和掌权以后，对无产阶级革命派都是一个新的严峻的考验。
    我们无产阶级革命派的一切言论和行动，必须以毛泽东思想为标准。这是我们的最高原则。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就拥护，就照办；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就抵制，就反对。正是根据这个原则，我们造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。在这场斗争中，无产阶级革命派因为坚持这个原则，遭受过打击，经受了风浪。也正是因为坚持这个原则，无产阶级革命派取得了夺权斗争的胜利。在胜利以后，我们也必须永远坚持这个原则，而绝不能违反这个原则。我们自己一切不符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动，都应当作自我批评，应当切实改正，并且应当允许和欢迎别人批评、别人抵制、别人反对，应当允许和欢迎群众的监督。只有这样，才能及时改正错误，不犯大错误，不犯方向路线错误，不至于蜕化变质；才能逐步树立无产阶级世界观，真正为无产阶级掌权，真正贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”
    我们的同志要在改造自己世界观上狠下功夫，斗倒“私”字，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。只有那种善于用阶级分析、阶级斗争观点看待社会也看待自己的人，那种能对自己头脑中旧东西坚决地进行斗争的人，那种在改造客观世界斗争中同时改造自己主观世界的人，才是真正有希望的人。
    我们的副统帅林彪同志，几十年来，一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作。林彪同志是毛主席亲密的战友，最好的学生，是全党和全国人民活学活用毛主席著作最光辉的榜样。我们要响应林彪同志的号召，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。只要我们这样坚持不懈地作下去，用毛泽东思想改造我们的世界观，我们就一定能够夺取无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，夺取社会主义革命事业的一个又一个新胜利，并且巩固这些胜利，发展这些胜利。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手毛主席万岁！
