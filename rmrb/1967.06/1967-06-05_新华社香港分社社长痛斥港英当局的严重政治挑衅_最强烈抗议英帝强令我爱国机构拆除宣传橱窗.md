	The head of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, Liang Weilin, strongly condemned the British authorities' serious political provocation on the evening of June 3. He lodged the strongest protest against the British imperialists' order to dismantle the propaganda display windows of patriotic institutions.

	The Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch reported on June 4 that on June 3, the British authorities in Hong Kong sent armed police to threaten and intimidate patriotic bookstores, banks, department stores, and cinemas in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They ordered these institutions to remove display windows featuring images and text that promote Mao Zedong Thought and expose the British authorities' bloody suppression of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. In a letter of protest to the British "Governor" David Trench, Liang Weilin stated:

	"The British authorities in Hong Kong today sent armed police to threaten and intimidate patriotic bookstores, banks, department stores, and cinemas in Hong Kong and Kowloon, ordering these institutions to remove display windows featuring images and text that promote Mao Zedong Thought and expose the British authorities' bloody suppression of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. This action was immediately met with a resolute refusal by the staff of these institutions. The British authorities' actions are a serious political provocation against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Chinese people. This is absolutely intolerable to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Chinese people. I hereby lodge the strongest protest against you.

	"The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are bravely fighting against persecution, fear no provocation from the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British authorities must immediately revoke this arbitrary and unreasonable measure. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be the full responsibility of the British authorities in Hong Kong."

    新华社香港分社社长痛斥港英当局的严重政治挑衅
    最强烈抗议英帝强令我爱国机构拆除宣传橱窗
    新华社香港四日电  新华社香港分社社长梁威林三日晚就港英当局三日派出武装警察向港九爱国书店、银行、百货公司和电影院等机构进行威胁和恐吓，强令各机构拆除展出宣传毛泽东思想、揭露港英当局血腥镇压港九爱国同胞罪行的图片和文字的橱窗这一严重政治挑衅行为，向港英“总督”戴麟趾提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。梁威林在给戴麟趾的抗议书中指出：“港英当局今天派出武装警察向港九爱国书店、银行、百货公司和电影院等机构进行威胁和恐吓，强令各机构拆除宣传毛泽东思想、揭露港英当局血腥镇压港九爱国同胞的图片和文字的橱窗，当即遭到各机构职工理直气壮的坚决拒绝。港英当局这一行动是敌视港九爱国同胞和中国人民的又一次严重政治挑衅。对此，港九爱国同胞和中国人民是绝对不能容忍的。我向你提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
      “用毛泽东思想武装起来的、正在英勇地进行反迫害斗争的港九爱国同胞，对港英当局的任何挑衅都是无所畏惧的。港英当局必须立即取消这一横蛮无理的措施。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，完全由港英当局负责。”
