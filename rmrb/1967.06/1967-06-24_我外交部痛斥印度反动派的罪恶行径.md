The Indian reactionary government has arbitrarily rejected China's request to send a special plane to New Delhi to bring back injured personnel from the Chinese embassy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly condemns the Indian reactionaries' evil deeds. The Indian government must guarantee the personal safety and travel convenience of the Chinese embassy personnel; otherwise, China will take necessary corresponding measures.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 23, our correspondent reports: The Indian reactionary government has recently acted in an extremely arbitrary and unreasonable manner by rejecting China's request to send a special plane to New Delhi to bring back the Chinese embassy personnel who were injured by mobs. This despicable behavior once again exposed the ugly face of the Indian reactionary government in front of global public opinion.

On June 16, under the orchestration of the Indian reactionary government, a large mob attacked the Chinese embassy in India, injuring eight embassy staff members. Each of them sustained more than ten injuries, some were beaten unconscious, and some had severe head injuries. However, the Indian government delayed providing emergency medical treatment. Later, although the injured were sent to the hospital, the Indian side took various discriminatory measures, even refusing to allow the Chinese embassy's acting charge d'affaires and his friends to visit the injured personnel. The injured personnel were also obstructed when they tried to call the embassy to report their conditions.

Under these circumstances, the Chinese government decided on June 18 to send a special plane of the Civil Aviation Administration to New Delhi to bring them back to China for treatment. However, the Indian reactionary government was terrified by this measure and used various absurd excuses to reject it.

On June 19, the acting charge d'affaires of the Indian embassy in China, Shati, handed over a note to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, falsely claiming that the Indian embassy in China had been "besieged" and unreasonably linking this fabricated claim to China's request to send a special plane to India, saying that "if the Chinese government does not immediately lift the current siege on the Indian embassy," it would "not even consider" China's request to send a special plane to New Delhi.

The responsible person from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs firmly rejected Shati's unreasonable demands and pointed out that this was intentional obstruction. He also sternly told the Indian acting charge d'affaires that after the Indian government orchestrated the fascist atrocities against the Chinese embassy, it abruptly cut off the communication between the Chinese embassy in India and Beijing. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government had sufficient reasons to take necessary emergency measures against the Indian embassy, which was completely unrelated to China's request to send a special plane to bring back the injured personnel. On the same day, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also notified the Indian embassy of the technical details regarding the route and time of the Chinese special plane and urged the Indian side to respond promptly.

On June 20, the Chinese side, noting that the Indian government had restored communication between the Chinese embassy in India and Beijing, announced the lifting of emergency measures against the Indian embassy in China. However, the shameless Indian government, in a note to the Chinese embassy in India on the same day, proposed a so-called "reciprocal" condition, stating that the Indian government would send a special plane to Beijing to bring back some Indian personnel and insisted that China must agree to this demand before it would "not oppose" China's request to send a special plane to India.

In a note to the Indian government on June 21, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned its "reciprocal" condition theory. The note stated: "The Indian government's proposal of so-called 'reciprocal' conditions is utterly unreasonable. Let me ask, has there been a bloody attack on the Indian embassy in Beijing similar to the one in New Delhi? Are there any Indian embassy personnel injured and in need of immediate medical treatment back to their country? What basis is there for talking about 'reciprocity'? It must be pointed out that despite the bloody incident orchestrated by India, which has caused great indignation among the Chinese people, the Chinese side has shown great restraint and has ensured the safety of all personnel at the Indian embassy. Even for a spy like Lu Guanshan, who has committed serious crimes in China, the Chinese side has treated him leniently. If the Indian embassy personnel need to return to their country, they can do so by taking a plane or train from Beijing as usual. What reason do you have to demand sending a special plane to China? Exposed, you are just trying to create a show, using this to cover up your bloody crimes of attacking the Chinese embassy, deceiving the Indian people, and inciting anti-China sentiment."

After the Indian reactionary government's fraud was exposed, it hurriedly sent a note to the Chinese government on June 21, stating that it would not send a plane to China and that its previous "conditional agreement" for the Chinese special plane to enter India on the same day had been "withdrawn." In another note on June 22, it evaded the facts, distorted the truth, and made excuses on the issue of the Indian spy Lu Guanshan, even attempting to shift the blame for the Indian government's orchestration of the mob attack on the Chinese embassy in India onto China, which was self-deceptive and ridiculous.

In a note on June 23, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sternly pointed out: "The Indian government openly organized mobs to attack the embassy of another country, committing a rare fascist atrocity in international relations, and has already been infamous internationally. Now, it uses various despicable tactics to reject China's request to send a special plane to bring back the injured personnel. The Indian government thinks it has gained something by doing this, but in reality, it is only lifting a stone to drop it on its own feet, further exposing its weakness and roguishness, and once again losing face in the world."

The note also emphasized: "Given that the personnel injured at the Chinese embassy by Indian mobs urgently need to return to China for further treatment, and the Indian government has been obstructing China's reasonable request to send a special plane without end, the Chinese government has decided to let them leave India by scheduled flights as soon as possible. The Indian government must guarantee the personal safety and travel convenience of the injured personnel, including First Secretary Chen Luzhi, and must not engage in any sabotage or obstruction. Otherwise, the Chinese side will take necessary corresponding measures, and do not say that you were not warned."

### 我外交部痛斥印度反动派的罪恶行径

    印度反动政府竟然横蛮拒绝我派专机接回使馆受伤人员
    我外交部痛斥印度反动派的罪恶行径
    印政府必须保证我使馆人员的人身安全和旅行便利，否则我将采取必要的相应措施
    据新华社二十三日讯　本社记者报道：印度反动政府最近十分横蛮无理地拒绝中国政府派专机去新德里接回中国大使馆被暴徒打伤的人员，阻挠他们及时回国治疗。这种恶劣行为再一次在全世界舆论面前暴露了印度反动政府的丑恶面目。
    六月十六日，在印度反动政府的一手策划下，大批暴徒袭击中国驻印度大使馆，把八名使馆工作人员打成重伤。他们每人都负伤十多处，有的被打得昏迷不醒，有的头部严重破裂，而印度政府却迟迟不予急救。后来伤员虽然被送进医院，印度方面又采取了种种歧视措施，甚至连中国驻印度大使馆临时代办同他的朋友到医院探视受伤人员，也遭到无理拒绝。受伤人员向使馆打电话报告病情也受到印方阻挠。
    在这种情况下，中国政府在六月十八日决定派民航专机前往新德里把他们接回国内治疗。但是，印度反动政府对中国政府的这个措施，怕得发抖，用种种荒唐的借口来加以拒绝。
    在十九日，印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯把一件复照交给中国外交部，硬说印度驻华大使馆遭到了什么“围困”，而且毫无道理地把这种捏造的说法同中国政府派专机去印度的问题硬扯在一起，说什么“如果中国政府不立即解除目前对印度大使馆的围困”，就“根本不予考虑”中国派专机去新德里的要求。
    中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人断然拒绝了沙梯的无理要求，并且指出这是有意刁难。他还向印度代办严正指出，印度政府在一手制造对中国大使馆的法西斯暴行之后，又悍然中断了中国驻印度大使馆同北京的电讯联系，在此情况下中国政府有充分理由对印度大使馆采取必要的紧急措施，这与中国政府派专机去接回受伤人员完全是两回事。同一天，中国外交部又照会印度大使馆，把有关中国民航专机的航线、时间等技术资料通知印方，催促印方尽速作出答复。
    二十日，中国方面鉴于印度政府已经恢复了中国驻印度大使馆同北京的电讯联系，宣布解除对印度驻华大使馆的紧急措施。但是厚颜无耻的印度政府在二十日照会中国驻印大使馆，竟然又提出了一个所谓“对等”条件，说什么印度政府要派一架专机去北京接运一些印度人员，它硬要在中国政府同意这个要求的前提下，才“不反对”中国派专机去印度。
    中国外交部在二十一日给印度政府的照会中痛斥了它的“对等”条件论。照会说：“印度政府提出所谓‘对等’条件，是毫无道理的。试问在北京发生过象新德里那样袭击中国大使馆的血腥暴行吗？印度驻华大使馆有什么人象中国大使馆人员那样受伤需立即回国就医吗？有什么理由谈得上‘对等’呢？必须指出，尽管印度制造的流血事件，引起了中国人民的极大愤慨，但是，中国方面却表现了极大的克制，切实保证了印度大使馆所有人员的安全，即使对鲁冠南这样一个在中国犯有严重罪行的间谍犯，中国方面也对他作了很宽大的处理。如果说印度大使馆人员需要回国，他们完全可以按通常作法乘飞机或火车离开北京。你们有什么理由提出要派专机来中国呢？戳穿了，你们不过是要装模作样，借此掩盖你们袭击中国大使馆的血腥罪行，欺骗印度人民，煽动反华。”
    印度反动政府的骗局被戳穿以后，赶忙就在二十一日照会中国政府，表示它不派飞机来中国了，它曾经“有条件地同意”中国专机在同一天进入印度的决定也“撤回”了。它在二十二日在另一件来照中，东拉西扯，躲躲闪闪，歪曲事实，又在印度间谍分子鲁冠南的问题上进行狡辩，甚至妄图把印度政府指使暴徒袭击中国驻印大使馆的罪责加在中国身上，真是自欺欺人，荒唐可笑。
    中国外交部在二十三日的复照中严正指出：“印度政府公然组织暴徒袭击一个国家的大使馆，制造了国际关系史上罕见的法西斯暴行，在国际上已经是声名狼藉，现在又采取上述各种卑劣手法拒绝中国派专机接回伤员。印度政府这样做，还自以为得计，实际上恰恰是搬起石头打自己的脚，进一步暴露了它自己的虚弱和无赖，在世界上又一次大丢其脸。”
    照会还强调指出：“鉴于中国大使馆被印度暴徒打伤的人员急需回国进一步治疗，而印度政府又对中国派专机的合理要求进行无休止的阻挠，中国政府已决定让他们尽快乘班机离开印度。印度政府必须保证中国一等秘书陈鲁直等受伤人员的人身安全和旅行便利，不得进行任何破坏和阻挠。否则，中国方面将采取必要的相应措施，勿谓言之不预。”
