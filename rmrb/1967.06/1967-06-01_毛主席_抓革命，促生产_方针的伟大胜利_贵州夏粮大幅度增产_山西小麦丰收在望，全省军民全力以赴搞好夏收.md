Guizhou Province's proletarian revolutionary masses have achieved a bumper harvest in the first summer season after seizing power. The broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas are full of vigor and enthusiasm, and are investing all their energy into the summer grain harvest battle with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." By the end of May, the province had harvested 2.16 million mu of wheat; peas, broad beans, barley, and potatoes have mostly been harvested. The harvest progress in most areas is faster than the same period last year. The masses reflect that the wheat this year is very good, and the more they harvest, the more enthusiastic they become.

The characteristics of Guizhou's summer grain bumper harvest this year are: first, all regions have significantly increased production; second, all types of summer grains have achieved a bumper harvest. The total summer grain production in the province's eight prefectures, autonomous regions, and cities is expected to increase by 20% compared to last year, with some areas increasing by onefold, far exceeding the highest production year in history. Not only has the total production of summer grains in various places increased significantly, but the yield per unit area has also improved.

Guizhou Province's full-scale significant increase in summer grain production this year is a great victory achieved by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." It is an inevitable result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. Since last autumn, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Guizhou Province have enthusiastically responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and have launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, through studying the "Three Articles" and implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," have established the idea of farming for revolution, breaking the erroneous arguments that "Guizhou is not suitable for growing wheat" and "growing summer grains is not worth the effort," and resolutely taking the path of developing grain production with two crops of rice and wheat. Each place, based on actual conditions, has increased the sowing area of summer grains compared to any previous year.

In late January this year, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Guizhou Province achieved a great victory in the struggle to seize power from a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the old provincial committee, giving the rural areas of the entire province a new look. Under the correct leadership of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," working on revolution at night and production during the day, strengthening the field management of summer crops. They, following Chairman Mao's teachings, with the revolutionary spirit of "firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," have overcome natural disasters such as spring drought, hail, and pests, ensuring a bumper harvest of summer grains.

The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in all rural areas of Guizhou Province have, in this summer's harvest work, resolutely put revolution in command of production, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. They have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, taking the great struggle and criticism of the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party as the driving force for work, firmly grasping revolution and vigorously promoting production, ensuring a bumper harvest of summer grains. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, while criticizing the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, have also resolutely fought against the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who sabotage revolution and production. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionary masses in rural areas deeply understand the great political significance of this summer's harvest, and they are full of fighting spirit, sparing no effort, displaying the style of bravely fighting, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous combat, consciously working more and doing heavy work, making this summer's harvest work done quickly and well. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres in rural areas have, during the summer harvest, reviewed "The Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" and Chairman Mao's relevant works, determined to achieve new merits in the summer harvest and boldly lead production. The proletarian revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts have also provided strong support for agricultural production.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, good news has come from the front lines of agricultural production in Shanxi Province: the wheat is growing well and a bumper harvest is in sight. The province's 17 million mu of wheat and other summer crops are gradually ripening from south to north, and the southern regions have already started harvesting, with the total production expected to increase significantly compared to last year.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the entire province are further implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, raising the banner of revolutionary criticism, putting the revolutionary mass criticism movement in the first place, using revolution to guide production, and ensuring the summer harvest work is done well, achieving a bumper harvest.

Last year, when Shanxi Province was sowing wheat, the rural proletarian revolutionary masses overcame the numerous obstacles set by the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, bravely shouldering the double burden of revolution and production, ensuring the completion of the wheat sowing task. After the proletarian revolutionary masses achieved victory in the struggle to seize power from the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, they immediately launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the province, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," with labor and production enthusiasm reaching an unprecedented height.

The first-line command organs of Shanxi Province for grasping revolution and promoting production have done a series of work to promote a bumper harvest of wheat. The Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Shanxi have also sent a large number of soldiers to support agricultural production. The soldiers have brought the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the "Four Firsts" and "Three-Eight Style" to the countryside, promoting the revolutionization of the thinking of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. The broad masses of militiamen have also fully played the roles of propaganda teams, combat teams, and shock teams in grasping revolution and promoting production.

Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Command Headquarters for Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production, the Headquarters of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and other leading organs have issued a joint notice, requiring all places to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to achieve the revolutionization of thinking, to further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production," to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, to carry the revolutionary mass criticism movement through to the end, and to promote a new high tide in summer production.

    毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利  
    贵州夏粮大幅度增产
    山西小麦丰收在望，全省军民全力以赴搞好夏收
    据新华社贵阳三十一日电　贵州省无产阶级革命派夺得掌权后第一个夏季农业丰产硕果，广大农村各族社员和革命干部，意气风发，斗志昂扬，正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，投入夏粮收获战斗。到五月下旬，全省小麦已收割二百一十六万亩；豌豆、蚕豆、大麦、马铃薯等作物已经大部收完。多数地区收获进度都比去年同期快。广大社员反映，今年麦子长得很好，越收越起劲。
    今年贵州夏粮丰收的特点，一是各地区普遍大幅度增产，二是各种夏粮作物全面丰收。全省八个专区、自治州、市，夏粮总产量同去年相比，预计少的增产两成，多的增产一倍，大大超过了历史上最高年份的产量。各地夏粮不但总产量大幅度增长，单位面积产量也有所提高。
    贵州省今年夏粮全面的大幅度增产，是广大贫下中农和革命干部在无产阶级文化大革命中坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针所取得的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命促进人的思想革命化的必然结果。从去年秋季以来，贵州省广大贫下中农和革命干部，热烈响应林彪副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的号召，掀起了大学毛主席著作的高潮。广大贫下中农和革命干部通过学习“老三篇”和贯彻执行毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，树立了为革命种田的思想，打破了那种认为“贵州不适合种小麦”、“种夏粮得不偿失”等错误论调，坚决在发展粮食生产上走稻麦两熟的道路。各地从实际情况出发，夏粮作物播种面积比过去任何一年都多。
    今年一月下旬，贵州省无产阶级革命派，取得了向旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的伟大胜利，使全省农村的革命和生产出现了崭新的面貌。广大社员和革命干部，在贵州省革命委员会的正确领导下，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，晚上闹革命，白天搞生产，加强了对夏收作物的田间管理。他们按照毛主席的教导，以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，战胜了春旱、冰雹、虫害等自然灾害，保证了夏粮丰收。
    贵州全省农村无产阶级革命派和革命干部，在今年夏收工作中，坚决以革命统帅生产，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。他们高举革命的批判旗帜，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，作为带动工作的动力，狠抓革命，猛促生产，坚决做到夏粮丰产丰收。广大贫下中农和革命干部在批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的同时，对破坏革命和生产的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子，进行了坚决的斗争。广大农村无产阶级革命派深知今年夏收的重大政治意义，他们斗志昂扬，全力以赴，发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，自觉地多干活，干重活，使今年夏收工作做得又快又好。广大农村革命干部，在夏收中也重温了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和毛主席的有关著作，决心在夏收中立新功，大胆地领导生产。各个战线上的无产阶级革命派和中国人民解放军指战员，也大力支援农业生产。
    据新华社太原三十一日电　在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，山西省农业生产第一线传来了小麦长势喜人、丰收在望的喜讯。全省一千七百多万亩小麦等夏收作物，由南到北，逐渐黄熟，南部地区已经开镰收割，预计总产量将比去年有较大幅度增长。
    目前，全省广大贫下中农和革命干部，进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命的批判旗帜，把革命的大批判运动放在首位，用革命统帅生产，保证搞好夏收工作，作到丰产丰收。
    山西省去年播种小麦的时刻，农村无产阶级革命派排除党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派设置的重重障碍，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，保证了小麦播种任务的完成。无产阶级革命派取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争胜利以后，立即在全省范围内掀起了学习毛主席著作的高潮，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，劳动生产积极性空前高涨。
    山西省各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥机构，对促进小麦大丰收做了一系列的工作。中国人民解放军山西省军区和驻晋部队，也派出大批指战员支援农业生产。指战员们把光焰无际的毛泽东思想和“四个第一”、“三八作风”带到农村，促进了广大贫下中农和革命干部的思想革命化。广大民兵在抓革命、促生产中也充分发挥了宣传队、战斗队和突击队的作用。
    山西省抓革命促生产第一线指挥部、中国人民解放军山西省军区司令部等领导机关，最近发出联合通告，要求各地更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，高举革命的批判大旗，把革命的大批判运动进行到底，促进夏季生产新高潮。
