After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, how can we continue to implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, hold power properly, use power properly, and ensure that our revolutionary government never changes color?

The "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" is an important document that answers this question using Mao Zedong Thought. After the publication of this document, it has been warmly responded to by many provinces and cities, and further measures have been proposed. All these regulations and measures boil down to one point: we must "serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary workers, not lords who sit on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism."

The representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction participating in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs all come from the masses. In the life-and-death class struggle with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, they shared joys and sorrows with the broad revolutionary masses, endured hardships together, and were closely connected. They represent the revolutionary interests of the masses, concentrate the will of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and thus enjoy very high prestige among the masses.

We, the proletarian revolutionary faction, must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person" after taking power. Even if we become committee members or representatives, we are still common people, ordinary workers. We must continue to live with the broad masses, work with them, and fight with them, maintaining broad, frequent, and close contact with the working people.

Revolutionary cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs should also do the same.

If, after becoming committee members or representatives, one thinks one is different from others, floats above, detaches from the grassroots, detaches from production, and detaches from one's original position, then one will not hear the voices of the masses and gradually become estranged from the broad masses. One will gradually lose the trust of the masses, gradually lose one's revolutionary nature and representativeness, and will not have true proletarian authority. If this continues, it will lead to "peaceful evolution," opposing oneself to the working people. This is very dangerous.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction who have been tempered and grown in the fiery crucible of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, forever unite with the working people, and forever maintain the firmness of the proletarian revolution to face new tests!

    永远和劳动人民打成一片	本报评论员
    无产阶级革命派当权以后，怎样才能继续执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，掌好权，用好权，保证我们的革命政权永不变色？
    《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，是一个用毛泽东思想回答这个问题的重要文件。这个文件发表后，受到了许多省市的热烈响应，并且进一步提出了自己的措施。所有这些规定和措施，归结到一点就是：必须“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。”
    毛主席教导我们：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”
    参加“三结合”临时权力机构的无产阶级革命派的代表人物，都来自群众。在跟党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行你死我活的阶级搏斗中，他们和广大革命群众，同甘苦，共患难，血肉相连。他们代表了群众的革命利益，集中了无产阶级革命派的意志，因而在群众中享有很高的威信。
    我们无产阶级革命派，在掌权以后，一定要永远记住毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，当了委员、代表，还是一个老百姓，是一个普通的劳动者。要继续和广大群众生活在一起，劳动在一起，战斗在一起，同劳动人民保持着广泛的经常的密切的联系。
    参加“三结合”临时权力机构的革命的领导干部，也应当这样去做。
    如果当了委员、代表，就以为与众不同，整天浮在上面，脱离基层，脱离生产，脱离自己原来的阵地，那么，就会听不到群众的呼声，慢慢同广大群众疏远起来。就会逐渐失去群众的信任，逐渐丧失自己的革命性和代表性，就不可能有真正的无产阶级权威。这样下去，就会“和平演变”，就会把自己同劳动人民对立起来。这是很危险的。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中锻炼和成长起来的无产阶级革命派的同志们，要牢牢地记住毛主席的伟大教导，永远和劳动人民打成一片，永远保持无产阶级革命的坚定性，迎接新的考验！
