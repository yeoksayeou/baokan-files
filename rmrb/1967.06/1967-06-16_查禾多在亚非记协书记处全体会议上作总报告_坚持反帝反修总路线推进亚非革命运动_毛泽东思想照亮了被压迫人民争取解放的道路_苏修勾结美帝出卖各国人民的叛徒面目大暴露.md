Chahdi, the Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, delivered a general report at the fifth general meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association today. The first part of the general report is a political report, and the second part discusses the achievements and future tasks of the Asian-African Journalists' Association.

In the first part of the political report, Chahdi first discussed some prominent features of the current global situation. He said that the fifth general meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association is being held at a time when the world revolution is entering a new era of historical significance. This is the era of Mao Zedong Thought, an era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and the world revolution is heading towards comprehensive victory.

The current situation of the struggle of the Asian-African peoples and the peoples of the world against imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism is excellent. The people's struggle, especially armed struggle, is on the rise. U.S. imperialism has fallen into a united encirclement by the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, and it is now at its wits' end.

The treacherous nature of the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist leadership has been exposed. The Asian-African peoples and the peoples of the world have a clearer understanding than ever before of the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionists.

One prominent feature of the current global situation is that the 700 million Chinese people are bravely carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and personally led by Chairman Mao Zedong. This is an unprecedented event that has shaken the world. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the path for revolutionary peoples, especially the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial, semi-feudal countries, to strive for liberation.

When Chahdi specifically elaborated on the above issues, he cited facts and discussed the rising struggle of the Asian-African peoples against imperialism led by the United States.

He said that in the face of the cruel and barbaric oppression and suppression by the reactionary rulers of various countries under the protection of the United States and other imperialists, the revolutionary peoples of the world firmly grasp the universal truth of Mao Zedong Thought, that is, "the central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power by force, to resolve issues through war."

Chahdi said, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The lifespan of imperialists will not be long because they do evil deeds, specifically supporting anti-people reactionaries in various countries, occupying a large number of colonies, semi-colonies, and military bases, and threatening peace with nuclear war. In this way, they force more than 90% of the people in the world to either rise up against them or to do so in the future. However, imperialists are still alive today, and they are still rampant in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are still oppressing the masses of their own people in the Western world. This situation must change. Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, is the task of the peoples of the world." This view proposed by Chairman Mao nine years ago is now accepted by more and more people.

He said that now, more than ever, revolutionary peoples feel the need to establish and consolidate a broad international united front against imperialism led by the United States. This united front must exclude the modern revisionists led by the Soviet leadership, because they have openly colluded with imperialism, betraying the anti-imperialist struggle being waged by the peoples of various countries. More and more people around the world have come to realize that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism.

The historical task of modern revisionism is to maintain imperialist and colonial rule in the capitalist world; to restore capitalism in the socialist world, and thus to collude with imperialism to jointly dominate the world.

Chahdi said that the Soviet modern revisionists have always played a dirty role in international politics. They collude with U.S. imperialism to continue trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. They use the peace deception to deceive the Vietnamese people to save and protect the U.S. imperialists' predicament in Vietnam. The Soviet modern revisionists are the same in their dealings with the aggression of the United States and Israel against the Arab countries. The Soviet modern revisionists want to strangle the struggle of the Arab peoples against U.S. imperialism and Israel, and ultimately extinguish the flames of the Arab peoples' revolutionary struggle.

The betrayal of the Soviet modern revisionists has gone so far that they now openly slander and attack the Chinese revolution and Mao Zedong Thought. They are hostile to the People's Republic of China, which is the revolutionary base of the peoples of the world. They use every means to obstruct and blockade Mao Zedong Thought. However, the more they try to obstruct Mao Zedong Thought, the more people will understand, learn, and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

Other dirty betrayals carried out by the Soviet modern revisionist group are to implement policies of surrender and division in Asian-African international organizations and conferences such as the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, the Asian-African Writers' Association, the Asian-African Journalists' Association, and many African liberation organizations. However, the more frantic their divisive and destructive activities are, the higher the revolutionary banner of various Asian-African organizations is raised, and the greater their influence becomes.

Chahdi warmly praised the international significance of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China. He said that Mao Zedong Thought has an increasingly great influence not only in China but also in the world.

He said that Chairman Mao brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed the teachings of Marx and Lenin, and raised them to a new stage. Chairman Mao is not only a great leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese revolution but also a great leader of the peoples of the world and the world revolution.

He said that not only communists but also more and more other revolutionary fighters around the world are learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. For the revolutionary peoples and fighters of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Mao Zedong Thought has become their guiding principle and sharpest weapon in opposing imperialism, opposing old and new colonialism, reactionaries, and waging national liberation struggles.

Chahdi said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, which is being carried out by 700 million Chinese people, is an unprecedented event that has shaken the world. Its primary purpose is to ensure that China will never change color, that China will forever remain red in politics, and will forever be the vanguard of the anti-imperialist struggle in the world.

The 700 million Chinese people are all engaged in the activity of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and this activity has even reached a stage beyond the scope of China. This is the most extensive and profound revolutionary mass activity in the history of the world so far.

Undoubtedly, the powerful Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will accelerate our historical process and open up a new era for the international proletarian revolutionary struggle.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will further strengthen China's position as a world revolutionary stronghold and inspire and strengthen the revolutionary liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Chahdi emphasized that it is the absolute task of revolutionaries and revolutionary journalists to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to support and defend the People's Republic of China, which is the revolutionary base of the peoples of the world. We live in the era of Mao Zedong Thought, so we believe that learning and applying, defending Mao Zedong Thought is the absolute task of revolutionaries and revolutionary journalists.

Chahdi discussed the development of the anti-imperialist struggle in Asia and Africa.

When talking about the situation in Indonesia, Chahdi pointed out that the Suharto-Nasution regime has now become the target of the Indonesian people's angry struggle, including armed struggle. Through their own bitter experiences, the Indonesian people have come to realize that the only way to seize power from the enemy is through armed struggle. In some places, battles have already begun, and the sparks of revolution will surely spread across the country.

Chahdi talked about the U.S.-led aggression in the Middle East and the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists. He said that the facts show that the United States is the chief criminal and the number one enemy of the Arab people. It has been proven that the Soviet revisionists are big deceivers and traitors who betray the interests of the Arab people. Therefore, when the Arab people oppose imperialism led by the United States, they must also carry out the struggle against the Soviet revisionists.

He said that the war of aggression launched by the U.S., Britain, and Israel has given the Arab people and the people of the world a big lesson. This war has greatly promoted the revolutionary awakening of the Arab people, and this revolutionary awakening will surely lead to a further upsurge in the revolutionary struggle of the Arab people. It has also increased the determination of the Palestinian people to liberate their homeland. The Arab people have tested true friends and false friends from their own experiences, and they have also tested the truth of revolution and the lies of deception. Mao Zedong Thought, the path of the Chinese revolution, the path of people's war, will surely attract more and more Arab people.

The second part of Chahdi's general report discusses the achievements and future tasks of the Asian-African Journalists' Association. He pointed out that the Association is a revolutionary organization of Asian-African journalists, and our activities must be consistent with and serve the revolutionary line of the Asian-African Journalists' Association. Our task is to use our Association as a platform to promote the revolutionary struggle of the Asian-African peoples and advance the struggle of the peoples of the world. Our organization must carry out activities to awaken the Asian-African peoples and journalists, inspire them with revolutionary enthusiasm, unite them, and fight against the enemies of the people, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and Soviet modern revisionism. We must adhere to the general line of opposing imperialism and modern revisionism and combine our struggle with the struggle of the Asian-African peoples.

Chahdi talked about the achievements made by the Secretariat after moving to Beijing in supporting the revolutionary struggles of various countries, the relationship with member organizations and Asian-African journalists, and publishing work. He said that since moving to Beijing, the Asian-African Journalists' Association has become more combative and stronger. We have successfully foiled the conspiracies of imperialism and revisionism to sabotage our organization.

When talking about the work of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and future tasks, Chahdi said that the Secretariat should organize Asian-African journalists to learn, apply, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. It should fully use news as a weapon to break through the blockade of imperialism and revisionism and spread Mao Zedong Thought to the Asian-African peoples; the Secretariat should effectively introduce to Asian-African journalists and peoples the current good situation in Asia, Africa, and the world, help them have the correct attitude towards the mainstream and the branches, encourage them to dare to struggle and dare to win, and create a great anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist, and anti-reactionary atmosphere; the Secretariat should more deeply and effectively expose the aggressive plots of U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism in Asia and Africa and the betrayal of the Soviet-led modern revisionists of the revolutionary cause of the Asian-African peoples, and should more effectively hold high the revolutionary banner of the progressive news workers' movement in Asia and Africa, and strive to propagate the reason why anti-imperialism must be anti-revisionism; the Secretariat should organize Asian-African journalists to actively and correctly propagate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, refute the slander of the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary propaganda machines against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China; the Secretariat should organize Asian-African revolutionary journalists to go deep into the revolutionary struggle, combine with the revolutionary masses, draw revolutionary strength from the revolutionary masses, and thus promote the revolutionary struggle of the Asian-African peoples and better serve the revolutionary cause of the Asian-African peoples.

    毛泽东思想照亮了被压迫人民争取解放的道路
    苏修勾结美帝出卖各国人民的叛徒面目大暴露
    新华社十五日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，今天在亚非新闻工作者协会第五次书记处全体会议上作了总报告。总报告的第一部分是政治报告，第二部分是亚非记协的工作成就和今后的战斗任务。
    查禾多在政治报告的第一部分中，首先谈到了当前世界总形势的一些显著特点。他说，亚非新闻工作者协会第五次书记处全会是在世界革命正在进入一个新的具有历史意义的时代的情况下召开的。这就是毛泽东思想的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃和世界革命走向全面胜利的时代。
    当前亚非人民和世界人民反对帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义的斗争形势是大好的。人民的斗争，特别是人民的武装斗争正在高涨。美帝国主义已经陷入了亚、非、拉和全世界人民协同一致的包围圈中，它现在已经山穷水尽。
    以苏联修正主义领导集团为首的现代修正主义者背信弃义的本质已经暴露。亚非人民和全世界人民比过去任何时候都更加认识了苏联修正主义者的叛徒本性。
    目前世界局势的一个显著特点是，七亿中国人民正在英勇地进行着由毛泽东主席发动并且亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是史无前例的震撼世界的事情。毛泽东思想为革命人民特别是殖民地和半殖民地半封建国家的人民照亮了道路。
    查禾多在具体阐述以上问题的时候，他列举事实，谈到了亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义斗争的高涨。
    他说，全世界革命人民在面对着美国以及其他帝国主义庇护下的各国当权的反动派的残酷和野蛮压迫和镇压时，紧紧掌握着毛泽东思想的普遍真理，即“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”
    查禾多说，毛主席指出：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地，以原子战争威胁和平。这样，他们就迫使全世界百分之九十以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。但是帝国主义者目前还是在活着，他们依然在向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲横行霸道。他们在西方世界也依然在压迫他们本国的人民群众。这种局面必需改变。结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”毛主席九年前提出的这个看法，今天为越来越多的人所接受。
    他说，现在，革命人民比过去任何时候都更加明确地感到需要建立和巩固广泛的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的国际统一战线。这一统一战线必须把以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义者排斥在外，因为他们已公然与帝国主义狼狈为奸，出卖了各国人民正在进行的反帝斗争。世界上越来越多的人已经认识到，反帝必须反修。
    现代修正主义的历史任务是在资本主义世界维持帝国主义和殖民主义统治；在社会主义世界恢复资本主义，从而与帝国主义勾结共同主宰世界。
    查禾多说，苏联现代修正主义者在国际政治上始终扮演肮脏的角色。他们和美帝国主义勾结起来继续设法迫使越南人民屈膝投降。他们用和平骗局来欺骗越南人民以挽救和保护美帝国主义在越南的困境。苏联现代修正主义者在对待美国和以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略战争所干的勾当的问题上也是如此。苏联现代修正主义者要扼杀阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义、以色列的斗争，最终要扑灭阿拉伯人民革命斗争的火焰。
    苏联现代修正主义者的背叛已经走得那么远，以致现在公开污蔑和攻击中国革命和毛泽东思想。他们敌视作为全世界人民革命根据地的中华人民共和国。他们千方百计阻挡和封锁毛泽东思想。然而，他们越要阻挡毛泽东思想，人们就越要了解、学习和运用毛泽东思想。
    苏联现代修正主义集团进行的其他肮脏的背叛就是在亚非国际组织机构和会议如亚非人民团结组织、亚非作协、亚非记协和许多非洲解放组织中实行投降和分裂政策。可是他们的分裂和破坏活动越疯狂，亚非各组织就把革命旗帜举得越高，其影响也更大。
    查禾多热烈赞扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的国际意义。他说，毛泽东思想不仅在中国而且在全世界，影响越来越大。
    他说，毛泽东主席天才地、创造性地和全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思和列宁的教导，而且把它提高到崭新的阶段。毛主席不仅是一位中国人民和中国革命的伟大领袖，而且也是世界人民和世界革命的伟大领袖。
    他说，不仅仅共产党人，而且越来越多的全世界的其他革命战士学习和运用毛泽东思想。对于亚非拉的革命人民和革命战士来说，毛泽东思想成了他们反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义、反动派和进行民族解放救国斗争的指导原则和最锐利的武器。
    查禾多说，由毛主席发动和领导的、七亿中国人民正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是史无前例的震撼世界的大事，其首要目的就是保证中国永不变颜色，中国在政治上将永远保持红色，将永远是世界反帝斗争的先锋。
    七亿中国人民一齐开展学习和运用毛泽东思想的活动，这个活动甚至提高到超过中国范围的阶段，这是迄今世界历史上未曾有过的一个最广泛最深刻的革命群众的活动。
    无疑问，强大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，将加速我们的历史进程，并将为国际的无产阶级革命斗争开辟一个新纪元。
    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，毛泽东主席的革命路线的胜利，进一步加强了中国作为世界革命堡垒的地位，鼓舞和加强了亚、非、拉丁美洲革命解放运动。
    查禾多强调说，因此，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，拥护和捍卫作为全世界人民的革命根据地的中华人民共和国，是革命者和革命新闻工作者的绝对任务。我们生活在毛泽东思想的时代，因此，我们认为，学习和运用、捍卫毛泽东思想是革命者和革命新闻工作者的绝对任务。
    查禾多谈到了亚洲和非洲反帝斗争的发展。
    查禾多在谈到印尼局势时指出，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权现在已成为印尼人民愤怒地进行斗争包括武装斗争的对象。印尼人民通过自己的沉痛经验，认识到从敌人手中夺取政权的唯一道路是武装斗争。在有的地方，已经开始了战斗，而星星之火肯定要燃遍全国。
    查禾多谈到了美国导演的对中东的侵略和苏修的背叛。他说，事实表明美国是战争的主犯，是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人。事实证明苏修是出卖阿拉伯人民利益的大骗子、大叛徒。因此，当阿拉伯人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义时必须进行反对苏修的斗争。
    他说，美、英、以发动的侵略战争，给阿拉伯人民和全世界人民上了一大课。这场战争大大促进了阿拉伯人民的革命觉醒，这种革命觉醒必将带来阿拉伯人民革命斗争的进一步高涨。这也增加了巴勒斯坦人民解放家园斗争的决心。阿拉伯人民从自己的经验中检验了真朋友、假朋友，也检验了革命的真理和骗人的鬼话。毛泽东思想、中国革命的道路、人民战争的道路，必将吸引越来越多的阿拉伯人民。
    查禾多的总报告第二部分谈到亚非新闻工作者协会的工作成就和今后的战斗任务。他指出，协会是一个亚非新闻工作者的革命组织，我们的活动必须是与亚非新闻工作者协会的革命路线一致并为其服务。我们的任务是利用我们的协会作为讲坛来促进亚非人民的革命斗争，推进全世界人民的斗争。我们的组织必须进行唤醒亚非人民和新闻工作者的活动，给予他们以革命热情，促使他们团结并向人民的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗和苏联现代修正主义进行斗争。我们必须坚持反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的总路线和使我们的斗争与亚非人民的斗争相结合。
    查禾多谈到了书记处迁来北京以后，在支持各国人民革命斗争、会员组织及亚非新闻工作者的关系、出版工作等各方面所取得的成绩。他说，书记处自迁至北京以后，亚非记协变得更加富有战斗性，更加强大了。我们成功地粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义破坏我们组织的阴谋。
    查禾多谈到亚非记协的工作和今后的战斗任务时说，书记处应该组织亚非新闻工作者学习、运用和宣传毛泽东思想。应该充分运用新闻作为武器来打破帝国主义和修正主义的封锁，把毛泽东思想传播给亚非人民；书记处应有效地向亚非新闻工作者和人民介绍目前亚、非及全世界的大好形势，帮助他们对待主流和支流有正确的态度，鼓舞他们敢于斗争，敢于胜利，大造帝、修和反动派的反；书记处应更深刻和更有效地揭露在亚非以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的侵略阴谋和以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义背叛亚非人民革命事业的行径，应该更有效地高举亚非进步新闻工作者运动的革命旗帜，努力宣传为什么反帝必须反修的道理；书记处应该组织亚非新闻工作者积极地和正确地宣传中国的无产阶级文化大革命，驳斥帝国主义、修正主义和反动派宣传机器对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诽谤；书记处应组织亚非革命新闻工作者深入革命斗争，和革命群众相结合，从革命群众中吸取革命力量，从而推动亚非人民的革命斗争，更好地为亚非人民的革命事业服务。
