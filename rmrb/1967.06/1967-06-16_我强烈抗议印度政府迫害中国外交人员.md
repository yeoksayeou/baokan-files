India's government fabricated charges and arbitrarily forced two of our diplomats to leave the country.

We strongly protest India's government's harassment of Chinese diplomats.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in a note to the Indian embassy that India's government's arbitrary actions are a serious provocation aimed at further worsening Sino-Indian relations, with the intention of covering up the unsavory activities of Indian embassy personnel in China.

New China News Agency, June 15th: The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Indian embassy in China, Satir, on the evening of the 15th, and handed him a note. The note strongly protested India's government's fabrication of charges and arbitrary expulsion of the first secretary of the Chinese embassy in India, Chen Luzhi, and the declaration that the third secretary, Xie Chenghao, is an "unwelcome person," ordering him to leave the country. The note pointed out: "This is a serious provocation by the Indian government aimed at further worsening relations between the two countries."

The note emphasized: "India's government's arbitrary actions are a despicable act of revenge against the recent handling of the Lu Guannan spy case by the relevant authorities in China, with the intention of covering up the unsavory activities of Indian embassy personnel in China. However, this is in vain. The spy crimes committed by Lu Guannan in China are irrefutable, and the handling of this case by the relevant authorities in China is completely justified and necessary. The so-called 'charges' imposed by the Indian government on Chinese diplomats are entirely fabricated. Indian foreign ministry officials could not provide any factual basis when questioned by the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in India, Li Zhili, and were caught in an embarrassing situation. The Indian government's actions can only further embarrass itself and in no way tarnish the reputation of Chinese diplomats."

The note stated: "The Chinese government firmly rejects India's government's false accusations against the first secretary of the Chinese embassy in India, Chen Luzhi, and the third secretary, Xie Chenghao, and the absurd claim that the first secretary, Chen Luzhi, is not a diplomat. The Chinese government has decided to immediately recall the first secretary, Chen Luzhi, and the third secretary, Xie Chenghao. Before they leave India, the Indian government must ensure their safety and must not use any excuse to obstruct their normal diplomatic activities; otherwise, the Indian government will bear all serious consequences that arise from this."

After handing over the note, the responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made two verbal protests to the Indian acting charge d'affaires: first, protesting India's government's instigation of hundreds of rioters to the Chinese embassy in India on the 14th to provoke trouble, shouting reactionary slogans, attacking the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and smashing the exhibition windows of the embassy; second, protesting India's government's arbitrary restriction of the freedom of movement of Chinese embassy personnel and their families, pointing out that this is a provocation and discrimination against the Chinese embassy, and demanding that the Indian government immediately revoke these arbitrary measures.

New China News Agency, June 15th: News from New Delhi: After the Indian embassy spy, Lu Guannan, was caught red-handed while engaging in espionage activities in China and was sentenced and expelled, the Indian reactionary government was both angry and resentful. However, it could not deny the dirty crimes committed by Lu Guannan and others against the Chinese people, so it had to resort to extremely despicable acts of revenge, forcing two Chinese embassy diplomats to leave the country.

On the 13th, the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, and read out a note accusing the first secretary of the Chinese embassy, Chen Luzhi, of "collecting military intelligence and engaging in subversive activities" in India, and therefore not recognizing his diplomatic status, demanding that he register like a regular foreigner at the "Foreigners Registration Office." Chen Zhaoyuan questioned the basis for these accusations, and the Indian officials were stumped, unable to provide any basis, and were caught in an embarrassing situation on the spot.

Chen Zhaoyuan immediately made a solemn declaration that Chinese diplomats are educated under the great thought of Mao Zedong, their behavior is upright and above board, in accordance with international law and international customs, and in line with diplomatic status, beyond reproach. Chen Zhaoyuan pointed out that the Indian government's inability to provide any factual basis only proves that its accusations are purely fabricated. This is a very despicable tactic and a serious step to further worsen relations between the two countries. He expressed his firm rejection of all the Indian government's unreasonable demands and refused to accept the Indian side's note. Chen Luzhi, who was present, also strongly protested the Indian government's slander and firmly rejected the Indian side's demands.

On the 14th, the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent two more notes to the Chinese embassy, announcing further harassment of Chinese diplomats. One note, issued on the orders of the Indian President, announced a so-called "expulsion order," demanding that Chen Luzhi leave India immediately by plane and never re-enter the country. Another note accused the third secretary of the Chinese embassy, Xie Chenghao, of "engaging in various subversive activities harmful to Indian security," but similarly could not provide any factual basis, and arbitrarily declared him an "unwelcome person," demanding that he leave India within 72 hours. The Chinese embassy immediately returned the Indian government's notes.

In addition to forcing Chinese embassy personnel to leave the country, the Indian reactionary government also arbitrarily restricted the freedom of movement of Chinese embassy personnel. On the 13th, the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed a note to the Chinese embassy, demanding that any personnel and family members of the embassy, whether enjoying or not enjoying diplomatic privileges, must not leave the jurisdiction of the New Delhi and Old Delhi municipal authorities without prior approval from the Protocol Department of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is a serious discrimination against the Chinese embassy and another serious step by the Indian government to worsen relations between the two countries.

The Indian Parliament staged a noisy anti-China farce on the 13th and 14th. Congress Party and other reactionary party members (including the Dange faction) shouted about the incident of the Indian spy, Lu Guannan, being caught by the Chinese people, demanding "strong actions," "breaking off relations with China," and "locking up the Chinese embassy personnel," etc. On the 14th, the Indian government instigated hundreds of rioters to cause trouble at the Chinese embassy, shouting reactionary slogans to insult the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and smashing the exhibition windows of the Chinese embassy.

The Indian reactionaries' despicable tactics to threaten the Chinese people are in vain. The Indian spies, Lu Guannan and Vijay, have already been expelled from China on the 15th. The Chinese people will continue to follow the teachings of the great leader, Chairman Mao, to be vigilant against imperialist elements and their running dogs, and will not hesitate to give them the punishment they deserve for any sabotage activities.

    印度政府捏造罪名无理强迫我两名外交人员离境
    我强烈抗议印度政府迫害中国外交人员
    外交部在给印使馆的照会中指出，印度政府这一无理措施，是蓄意进一步恶化中印关系的严重挑衅步骤，其目的在于掩盖印度大使馆人员在中国所进行的不光彩的行径
    新华社十五日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人十五日晚间召见印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，交给他一件照会，强烈抗议印度政府捏造罪名，无理强迫中国驻印度大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直立即离印，并且无理宣布三等秘书谢承浩为“不受欢迎的人”，限期离印。照会指出：“这是印度政府蓄意进一步恶化中印两国关系的严重挑衅步骤。”
    照会强调指出：“印度政府这一无理措施是对中国有关当局最近处理鲁冠南间谍案所采取的卑劣的报复手段，其目的在于掩盖印度大使馆人员在中国所进行的不光彩的行径。但是，这是徒劳的。鲁冠南在中国所犯的间谍罪行，证据确凿，无法抵赖，中国有关当局对此案的处理是完全正当的，必要的。而印度政府强加在中国外交官身上的所谓‘罪名’则完全是凭空捏造的，印度外交部官员在中国驻印度大使馆临时代办理直气壮的质问下，根本提不出任何事实根据，窘态毕露。印度政府的这种做法只能进一步使它自己出丑，而丝毫无损于中国外交人员的声誉。”
    照会说：“中国政府断然拒绝印度政府对中国驻印度大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直、三等秘书谢承浩的诬控和不承认一等秘书陈鲁直外交官身份的荒诞做法。中国政府现决定立即召回一等秘书陈鲁直和三等秘书谢承浩。在他们离开印度之前，印度政府必须切实保障他们的安全，并不得用任何借口阻碍其正常的外交活动，否则印度政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。”
    在递交照会以后，中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人向印度临时代办提出了两项口头抗议：一、抗议印度政府十四日唆使数百名暴徒到中国驻印度大使馆门前进行挑衅，狂喊反动口号，攻击中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，并砸坏大使馆的图片展览橱窗；二、抗议印度政府无理限制中国大使馆人员和家属的行动自由，指出这是对中国大使馆的挑衅和歧视，要求印度政府立即撤销这种无理的措施。
    新华社十五日讯　新德里消息：印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南在中国搞间谍活动时被当场拿获并被判罪和驱逐以后，印度反动政府又恼又恨。但是它无法抵赖鲁冠南等人对中国人民犯下的肮脏罪行，只得采取极端卑鄙的报复手段，硬要中国驻印度大使馆的两名外交人员离境。
    十三日印度外交部约见中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源，宣读一件照会，诬蔑中国大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直在印度“收集军事情报，从事颠覆性活动”，因此不承认他的外交身份，要他象一般外侨一样到“外国人登记处”去登记。陈肇源质问这种指责有什么事实根据，印度官员被问得张口结舌，一点根据也提不出来，当场出丑。
    陈肇源当场严正声明，中国外交人员是在伟大的毛泽东思想教育下成长的，行为光明正大，合乎国际法和国际惯例，符合外交身份，无可非议。陈肇源指出，印度政府提不出任何事实根据，只能证明它的指责纯粹是捏造。这是一种十分卑劣的手法，是进一步恶化两国关系的严重步骤。他表示断然拒绝印度政府的一切无理要求，并且拒绝接受印方的照会。在场的陈鲁直也严正抗议印度政府对他的诬蔑，表示坚决拒绝印方的要求。
    十四日印度外交部又把两件照会送交中国大使馆，宣布对中国外交人员进一步进行迫害。一件照会竟以印度总统之命宣布所谓“驱逐令”，硬要陈鲁直立即坐飞机离开印度，并且不许他再进入印度。另一件照会诬蔑中国大使馆三等秘书谢承浩“从事危害印度安全的各种颠覆活动”而又同样提不出任何事实根据，却无理宣布他是“不受欢迎的人”，硬要他在七十二小时内离开印度。中国大使馆立即退回了印度政府的这些照会。
    除了强迫中国大使馆人员离境以外，印度反动政府还横蛮地限制中国大使馆人员的行动自由。十三日，印度外交部把一件照会交给中国大使馆，硬要大使馆任何享有和不享有外交特权的人员和家属，未经印度外交部礼宾司的事先同意，不得走出新旧德里市政当局的管辖区。这是印度政府对中国大使馆的严重歧视和蓄意恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤。
    印度议会在十三、十四日接连出现了吵吵嚷嚷的反华闹剧。国大党和其它反动政党（包括丹吉集团）的议员，就印度间谍分子鲁冠南被中国人民拿获的事件，大叫大嚷什么要采取“强有力的行动”、“同中国断交”、“把中国大使馆的人员关起来”等等。十四日，印度政府唆使数百名暴徒到中国大使馆门前无理取闹，狂喊反动口号污辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，并且砸坏中国大使馆的图片展览橱窗。
    印度反动派想用这些卑劣的手段来威胁中国人民是徒劳的。印度间谍分子鲁冠南和印度大使馆三等秘书维杰已经在十五日被赶出中国。中国人民将继续按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，对帝国主义分子及其走狗保持警惕，并且对他们的任何破坏活动毫不犹豫地给予应得的惩戒。
