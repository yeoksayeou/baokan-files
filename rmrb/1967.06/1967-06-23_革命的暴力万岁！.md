Lenin said: "Marxists have never forgotten that violence is the inevitable companion of the complete collapse of capitalism and the birth of the socialist society."

Marxist-Leninists have always believed that violence is class-based, and it is necessary to strictly distinguish between revolutionary violence and counter-revolutionary violence, and to use revolutionary violence to eliminate counter-revolutionary violence.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is always correct."

Under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have always fully supported the armed struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations. Our support for the Vietnamese and Congolese (Kinshasa) peoples is the most powerful example. We must shout: "Long live revolutionary violence!"

However, in the anti-China farce directed by the Kremlin, the clown Fedosseev recently popped up again. In the Soviet revisionist magazine "Communist," he published an anti-China article, viciously attacking Chairman Mao's brilliant theory on people's armed struggle. He avoids talking about the class nature of violence but shouts loudly that China is a "proponent of the theory of violence," that China is "promoting the theory of exporting revolution through war," and so on.

The likes of Fedosseev strive to erase the fundamental difference between revolutionary violence and counter-revolutionary violence, which clearly shows that you have something to hide. You pretend to oppose all violence, but in reality, you are striving to suppress revolutionary violence and support counter-revolutionary violence. The Soviet revisionist leadership has long been infamous as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, standing with the U.S. and playing the role of international police. Wherever revolutionary violence erupts, you suppress it; wherever the flames of revolutionary struggle burn, you extinguish them. Isn't it you who, together with the U.S., are plotting "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue, trying to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation? Isn't it you who, following the U.S., are propping up the puppet Mobutu in Congo (Kinshasa), attempting to eliminate the Congolese people's revolutionary armed forces? All this doesn't clearly show that you are the executioners who actively support counter-revolutionary violence to suppress revolutionary violence?

You chant "peace" all day, praying for a so-called "world without weapons, without armies, without wars," and forcing the "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition" revisionist line on the revolutionary peoples of various countries. This doesn't clearly show that you allow imperialism and reactionaries to commit violence, but do not allow revolutionary peoples to resist with revolutionary violence?

The crux of the matter is, since the class enemy has brought the "bayonet to the agenda," revolutionary peoples must respond to force with force, and use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. If one does not understand this principle, the revolution will suffer defeat.

The Soviet revisionist leaders implement bourgeois dictatorship at home and fully restore capitalism. In today's Soviet Union, as long as someone stands up to oppose your revisionist rule, you use fascist violent means such as surveillance, tailing, arrest, and imprisonment to deal with them, and have even bloodily suppressed workers' strikes and mass resistance struggles more than once. All these facts show that you have already implemented fascist rule at home.

Just as our proletarian cultural revolution is producing an increasingly great revolutionary impact among the revolutionary peoples of the world, you again bring out the old tune that China is "promoting the theory of exporting revolution through war." Your true intention is not in the words; you are afraid that the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people will awaken the Soviet people to rise up and overthrow your revisionist rule. Precisely out of this political need, you play the old tune again, attempting to resist the great influence of our cultural revolution.

Soviet revisionist traitors, what use is your fear? The truth of Marxism-Leninism cannot be blocked, and the spread of revolutionary thought knows no borders. No matter how you threaten, blockade, or suppress, the spread of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be stopped, and the Soviet people's admiration for the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao—cannot be suppressed. Whether it is you or your master, U.S. imperialism, you cannot stop the forward march of history. Revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly achieve victory.

    革命的暴力万岁！
    天津大学“八一三”红卫兵
    列宁说：“马克思主义者从来没有忘记，暴力是整个资本主义彻底崩溃和社会主义社会诞生的必然伴侣。”
    马克思列宁主义者从来认为，暴力是有阶级性的，必须严格区分革命的暴力和反革命的暴力，必须用革命的暴力去消灭反革命的暴力。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    在毛泽东思想领导下的中国人民从来是全力支持一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的武装斗争的，我们对越南人民和刚果（金）人民的支持，就是最有力的说明。我们就是要高呼：“革命的暴力万岁！”
    可是，在克里姆林宫导演的反华丑剧中，跳梁小丑费多谢耶夫最近又蹦了出来，他在苏修杂志《共产党人》上发表了一篇反华文章，恶毒攻击毛主席关于人民武装斗争的光辉理论。他绝口不谈暴力的阶级性，却声嘶力竭地叫嚷，什么中国是“‘暴力论’宣扬者”，中国“在宣扬通过战争‘输出’革命的理论”，等等。
    费多谢耶夫之流竭力抹杀革命的暴力和反革命暴力的根本区别，正好说明你们心里有鬼。你们貌似反对一切暴力，但实际上，竭力扼杀的是革命的暴力，竭力支持的是反革命的暴力。苏修领导集团早就是臭名远扬的美帝国主义的头号帮凶，跟美帝站在一起，扮演着国际宪兵的角色。哪里爆发了革命的暴力行动，你们就镇压；哪里燃起了革命的斗争烈火，你们就扑灭。不就是你们，帮着美帝在越南问题上大搞“和谈”阴谋，企图扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争；不就是你们，紧跟美帝在刚果（金）扶植傀儡蒙博托，妄想消灭刚果（金）人民的革命武装。这一切，难道不是有力地说明你们正是积极支持反革命暴力来镇压革命暴力的刽子手吗？
    你们嘴里整天念着“和平经”，祈求一个所谓“没有武器，没有军队，没有战争”的“三无世界”，硬要把“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”、“和平过渡”的修正主义路线强加于各国革命人民，这不正说明：你们只许帝国主义和反动派滥施暴力，而不许革命人民用革命的暴力进行反抗吗？
    问题的实质是，既然阶级敌人已经把“刺刀提到议事日程上来”，那么革命人民也就必须用武力来回答武力，就要用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，如果不懂得这个道理，革命就会遭到失败。
    苏修头子们在国内实行资产阶级专政，全面复辟资本主义。在今天的苏联，只要谁起来反对你们的修正主义统治，你们就采用监视、盯梢、逮捕和监禁等等法西斯暴力手段来对付他们，甚至不止一次地血腥镇压工人罢工和群众反抗的斗争。种种事实表明，你们在国内已经实行法西斯统治了。
    正当我国的无产阶级文化大革命在全世界革命人民中产生越来越大的革命影响的时候，你们又搬出了中国“宣扬通过战争‘输出’革命的理论”这套滥调。醉翁之意不在酒，你们就是害怕中国人民的革命造反精神，会促使苏联人民觉醒，起来推翻你们的修正主义统治。正是出于这种政治上的需要，你们旧调重弹，妄想抵制我国文化大革命的巨大影响。
    苏修叛徒们，你们害怕又有什么用呢？马列主义的真理是封锁不住的，革命思想的传播是没有国界的。不管你们威吓也好，封锁也好，镇压也好，毛泽东思想的传播是禁止不住的，苏联人民对当代列宁——毛主席的敬仰，也是压制不了的。不管是你们，还是你们的主子美帝国主义，都阻止不了历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。
