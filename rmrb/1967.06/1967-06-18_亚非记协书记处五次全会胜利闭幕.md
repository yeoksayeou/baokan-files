In this new historical period, the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries is surging forward. Armed struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. The current situation is excellent, and the world revolution is advancing towards global victory.

The resolution states that Chairman Mao leads all oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Chairman Mao is the great leader beloved by revolutionary people worldwide. The great Mao Zedong Thought has become a powerful ideological weapon and guiding principle for the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions in their struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces.

The resolution strongly condemns the suppression of the revolutionary struggles of the world's people by American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. It points out that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Asian-African people and the people of the world, while Soviet modern revisionism is the chief accomplice of American imperialism and a traitor to the world's revolutionary people. To oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism.
