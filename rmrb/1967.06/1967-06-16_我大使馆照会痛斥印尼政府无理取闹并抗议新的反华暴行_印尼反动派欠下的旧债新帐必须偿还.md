The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 13, stating: "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, absolutely cannot tolerate the humiliation of the dignity of our great motherland, and absolutely cannot tolerate the persecution of our compatriots. No matter what tricks you play, as long as you continue to be anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese, the Chinese people will resolutely fight you to the end."

The note said: "If the Indonesian government, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese people, insists on being anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese, it will only reap what it has sown and will not end well."

The Chinese Embassy's note on June 13 was a rebuttal to a note from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 27. The Chinese Embassy's note said that the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in its note, slandered the Chinese government for not fulfilling its responsibility to protect the lives and property of the Indonesian Embassy in China and its personnel, and demanded guarantees for the so-called safety and tranquility of the Indonesian Embassy personnel in China. This is a great insult to the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The Chinese Embassy firmly rejects this slander.

The Chinese Embassy's note said: "The Chinese government has always protected the safety of diplomatic missions and personnel of all countries in China, and there is no such thing as foreign embassy personnel being threatened. You are fabricating this unreasonable demand to cover up your anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese atrocities, shift the blame for your destruction of bilateral relations, and create an excuse to further destroy bilateral relations. The Chinese Embassy expresses great indignation at your despicable tactics and strongly protests."

The note said: "The whole world knows that the safety of the lives and property of foreign diplomatic missions and personnel is not guaranteed in Indonesia, but precisely in Indonesia. The incidents of foreign diplomatic missions being attacked, destroyed, and searched by the armed forces of the host country are not happening in China, but are continuously occurring in Indonesia. Those who brazenly violate diplomatic privileges, injure, and abduct diplomatic personnel are not others, but the Indonesian government itself."

The note then listed a series of facts to show that since October 1965, the Indonesian government has launched a frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese wave, committed a series of fascist atrocities, violated the most basic norms of state relations, infringed upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese diplomatic mission, and harmed the personal safety and freedom of Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel. The note said: "A large number of facts indisputably prove: those whose personal safety and property safety are seriously threatened are precisely the Chinese diplomatic mission and its personnel in Indonesia. Those who have the right to demand guarantees for the safety of diplomatic missions and their personnel and to perform their normal duties are not you, but us. For your anti-Chinese atrocities over the past year, the Chinese government has repeatedly submitted notes of protest to you, demanding that you publicly apologize and compensate for the losses; immediately stop all anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese crimes; and effectively guarantee the safety of the Chinese diplomatic mission and its personnel, ensuring that similar incidents do not occur again. However, you have not only failed to fulfill your own responsibilities, but have also insisted on your own way, becoming more and more intense, pushing the relationship between the two countries to the brink of complete rupture. The facts are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable. This account must be settled."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on June 15, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 9, expressing great indignation at the recent atrocities of racial persecution of overseas Chinese by the military authorities in East Java's Rock View City, and lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government.

The note said that on May 31, the military authorities in Rock View City arbitrarily ordered eight Chinese shop owners to hand over their shops within a deadline. On June 2 and 3, the Rock View military authorities dispatched a large number of fully armed military police and thugs dressed in civil defense uniforms and armed with weapons, riding in trucks and fire engines, to the city's commercial district, sealing off the roads and preventing Chinese from moving around. Then, they used iron bars, axes, saws, and chisels to pry open the doors and windows of the eight Chinese shops, including those of Yang Tingpan and Li Shunhe, and brazenly occupied them. When the shop owners and neighbors, along with Chinese youth present, spoke out in righteous indignation, this group of fascist military police and thugs savagely beat the unarmed Chinese with gun butts, belts, and iron bars, and brutally sprayed them with water hoses. Unable to bear it any longer, the Chinese were forced to resist the violence. The military authorities immediately dispatched more military police and thugs to attack the innocent Chinese, resulting in many Chinese being beaten on the spot. Then, these fascist military police kicked and dragged the Chinese onto trucks and took them to prison. Within two days, more than a hundred innocent Chinese were illegally arrested. At the same time, the thugs were rampaging everywhere, attacking Chinese homes, intercepting and beating Chinese passersby, putting the Chinese in Rock View City in a terrifying atmosphere of racial persecution.

The Chinese Embassy's note said: "We must warn the Indonesian government: you think you can use brutal fascist methods to subdue the broad masses of overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which is simply a pipe dream. You have completely chosen the wrong target and miscalculated. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. As long as you do not stop the racial persecution of the Chinese, they will not stop their just struggle against persecution. The seven hundred million Chinese people, who are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will absolutely not tolerate your inhuman persecution of the Chinese. The old debts and new accounts you owe are definitely going to be settled. Your frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese actions will only result in 'lifting a stone to drop on your own feet' and will not end well!"

The note finally demanded that the Indonesian government: immediately release all detained Chinese, severely punish the perpetrators and instigators, immediately stop the forced seizure of Chinese shops, return the seized Chinese shops, compensate for all losses, and immediately stop all anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese racial persecution. Otherwise, the Indonesian government will be fully responsible for all serious consequences that arise from this.

    我大使馆照会痛斥印尼政府无理取闹并抗议新的反华暴行
    印尼反动派欠下的旧债新帐必须偿还
    新华社十五日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆六月十三日在给印尼外交部的一项照会中指出：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，绝对不能容忍伟大祖国的尊严受到侮辱，绝对不能容忍自己的侨胞受到迫害。不管你们耍什么花招，只要你们继续反华排华，中国人民就坚决同你们斗争到底。”
    照会说：“如果印度尼西亚政府不顾中国人民的一再警告，一意孤行，坚持反华排华的话，只能自食其果，决不会有好下场的。”
    中国大使馆六月十三日的照会是驳复印尼外交部五月二十七日的一项来照的。中国大使馆的照会说，印尼外交部在来照中，诬蔑中国政府没有负起保护印尼驻华大使馆和大使馆人员生命财产安全的责任，要求保证印尼驻华大使馆人员的所谓安全和安宁，这是对中国政府和中国人民的莫大侮辱。中国大使馆坚决拒绝这种诬蔑。
    中国大使馆的照会说：“中国政府一贯保护各国驻华代表机构及其人员的安全，根本不存在所谓外国使馆人员安全受到威胁的问题。你们无中生有地提出这个无理要求，无非是妄图借此掩盖你们反华排华的暴行，推卸你们破坏两国关系的罪责，为进一步破坏两国关系制造借口。对你们这种卑劣的手法，中国大使馆表示极大的愤慨，并提出强烈抗议。”
    照会说：“全世界都知道，外国代表机构和人员的生命和财产的安全失去保障的，不是在中国，而恰恰是在印度尼西亚。外国代表机构遭到驻在国武装部队的袭击、破坏和搜查的事件，不是发生在中国，而是连续不断地发生在印度尼西亚。肆无忌惮地侵犯外交特权、枪伤和劫持外交人员的，不是别人，恰恰是印度尼西亚政府自己。”
    照会接着列举了一系列事实，说明：从一九六五年十月以来，印尼政府就疯狂地掀起了反华排华浪潮，制造了一系列法西斯暴行，破坏了最起码的国家关系准则，侵犯了中国代表机构的外交特权，损害了中国外交和领事人员的人身安全和自由。照会说：“大量的事实无可辩驳地证明：人身安全和财产安全受到严重威胁的，正是中国驻印度尼西亚外交代表机构及其人员。有权要求保证外交代表机构及其人员生命财产的安全并履行其正常职务的，不是你们，而是我们。对于你们一年多以来的反华暴行，中国政府曾经不断向你们递交抗议照会，要求你们公开道歉和赔偿损失；立即停止一切反华排华罪行；切实保障中国代表机构及其人员的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。但是，你们不仅没有履行自己应尽的责任，反而一意孤行，愈演愈烈，把两国关系推向完全破裂的边缘。事实俱在，铁证如山，这笔帐是一定要算的。”
    据新华社十五日讯  雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆六月九日照会印尼外交部，对东爪哇军政当局最近在岩望市制造的骇人听闻的残酷迫害华侨的种族主义暴行，表示极大的愤慨，并向印尼政府提出最严重的抗议。
    照会说，五月三十一日，东爪哇岩望市军政当局蛮横无理地勒令八家华侨店主限期交出店面。六月二日和三日，岩望军政当局连续出动大批全副武装的军警和身着民防制服、手持凶器的暴徒，乘坐卡车和救火车来到该市商业区，严密封锁路口，不准华侨走动。接着，他们就用铁棒、斧头、钢锯、铁凿等工具，把杨挺磐、李顺和等八家华侨商店门窗撬开，气势汹汹地冲入店内，明目张胆地进行霸占。当店主和友邻及在场的华侨青少年义正词严地进行说理时，这批法西斯军警和暴徒竟野蛮地用枪托、皮带、铁棒等凶器，向手无寸铁的华侨疯狂围殴，还残暴地用水龙头向华侨猛烈喷射。华侨忍无可忍，被迫进行正义的抗暴自卫。军事当局立即增调军警和暴徒，向无辜华侨疯狂围攻，致使华侨多人当场被打伤。接着，这些法西斯军警便拳打脚踢地把华侨强行拖上卡车，押往监牢。两天内竟有一百多名无辜华侨遭到非法逮捕。与此同时，暴徒还到处行凶，疯狂地袭击华侨住宅，拦截和殴打过路华侨，使岩望市华侨处于种族主义迫害的恐怖气氛中。
    中国大使馆的照会说：“我们要正告印度尼西亚政府：你们妄图用残暴的法西斯手段来压服以毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨，简直是白日作梦，你们完全是找错了对象，打错了算盘。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。你们一天不停止对华侨的种族主义迫害，他们就一天也不会停止反迫害的正义斗争。正在胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，对你们惨无人道地迫害华侨，是绝对不能容忍的。你们所欠下的旧债新帐是一定要清算的。你们疯狂反华、排华，只能是‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，绝不会有好下场！”
    照会最后坚决要求印尼政府：立即释放全部被捕华侨，严惩肇事者和主使人，立即停止强行霸占华侨商店，归还被强占的华侨商店，赔偿一切损失，立即停止一切反华、排华的种族主义迫害。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由印尼政府全部承担。
