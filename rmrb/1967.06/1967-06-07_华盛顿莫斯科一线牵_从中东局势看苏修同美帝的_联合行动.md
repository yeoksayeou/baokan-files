The Soviet revisionist leadership is playing a trick on the Arab people, feigning support while actually betraying them. They verbally claim to stand on the side of the Arab countries, but in reality, they collude with American and British imperialism to extinguish the anti-imperialist flames of the Arab peoples. The following excerpts from recent reports and commentaries in Western capitalist newspapers clearly show the role played by the Soviet revisionist clique in the Middle East situation.

Johnson has sent an urgent, secret appeal to the Soviet Union, requesting joint diplomatic action to prevent the conflict between the Arabs and Israel from escalating out of control.

		U.S. State Department officials say that the Soviet Union has assured the United States that it has a definite stake in maintaining peace in the Middle East and preventing Arab-Israeli war.

		—Reuters, Washington

		The U.S. government has requested through its ambassador in Moscow that the Soviet Union use its influence to prevent the Middle East situation from turning into armed conflict.

		Moscow does not want hostile actions between Israel and the UAR, Syria. Moscow may be prepared to use its influence to ease the tension.

		—Agence France-Presse, Washington

		The United States is hoping that the Soviet Union will take parallel action to help resolve the Middle East crisis.

		The Kremlin has sent messages over the weekend to Washington, Jerusalem, and Cairo. Israeli sources say that the message received in Jerusalem is milder in tone than what the Soviets have publicly stated.

		Everyone's attention is now focused on the United Nations, where the parallel actions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union will receive the approval of the Security Council.

		—The Washington Post (USA)

		Recently, Soviet-American contacts have been frequent: in Moscow with U.S. Ambassador Thomas Thompson, in Washington with Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Yuri Chernyakov. In addition, many contacts have been made based on the exchange of secret letters between Johnson and Kosygin. Reliable information on this has not been made public so far.

		—Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, Washington

		The Middle East crisis is a typical situation where the United Nations should intervene. If a conflict occurs in the Middle East, the major powers will inevitably be drawn in.

		I think that the interests of the Soviet Union and ours are the same. They do not want a confrontation; they know the situation is dangerous.

		—U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright

		Despite the Soviet Union's extensive propaganda, American officials, after private talks with Moscow, feel that the Kremlin does not want to go too far and get involved in direct military action.

		—United Press International reporter Hansley

		British Foreign Secretary George Brown called on the Soviet Union to join in restoring the United Nations' presence in the Middle East to avoid war.

		Brown said, "We hope the Soviet Union will support our efforts in this regard. We hope the Soviet Union will support our call for an immediate Security Council meeting."

		—United Press International, Moscow

		Brown returned to his country yesterday (May 26) from Moscow, bringing back a secret assurance of Russian assistance in defusing the Middle East crisis.

		There is no doubt that the Soviet leaders are making urgent behind-the-scenes attempts to restrain Egypt.

		—The Daily Mirror (UK)

		Brown said at a press conference in Moscow that he had conducted "very thorough, very detailed, extremely friendly, and constructive" discussions with Soviet leaders on the Middle East issue. The discussion was based on "how to prevent the outbreak of a major fire" rather than the right or wrong of the events. He believes that in Moscow there is a very strong and urgent desire to ease the situation.

		—Reuters, Moscow

		Moscow is eager to calm down the war fever in the Middle East. There are strong indications that Moscow has shown that it is exerting a restraining influence on the Egyptian side of the dispute. The message received in Jerusalem (the capital of Israel) is milder in tone than what the Soviets have publicly stated.

		—The Washington Post (USA)

		Today, if Washington wants to protect Israel from Arab attacks, the fastest and cheapest way is to make a deal in Moscow. Only Moscow can prevent this crisis from escalating to a violent and uncontrollable level. If Moscow, at the right time, pulls Cairo back with a gentle attitude, then Washington will also benefit from Moscow.

    华盛顿莫斯科一线牵
    从中东局势看苏修同美帝的“联合行动”
    苏修领导集团对阿拉伯人民正在玩弄一套假支持、真出卖的把戏。他们口头上表示站在阿拉伯国家一边，实际上则同美英帝国主义串通一气，千方百计想要扑灭阿拉伯各国人民的反帝怒火。从下面摘录的最近西方资产阶级报刊的一些报道和评论中，可以清楚地看出，苏修集团在中东的局势的问题上扮演的是一个什么样的角色。
    约翰逊已向苏联发出一个紧急的、秘密的呼吁，要求采取联合外交行动使阿拉伯和以色列的冲突不致发展到无法控制的程度。　 
                         ——英国《星期日泰晤士报》
    美国国务院官员说，苏联已向美国保证，它在维持中东和平和防止阿拉伯—以色列战争方面有肯定的利害关系。
                         ——路透社华盛顿电
    美国政府已通过它的驻莫斯科大使要求苏联运用它的影响，防止中东局势变成一场武装冲突。
    莫斯科不希望在以色列和阿联、叙利亚之间发生敌对行动，……莫斯科可能准备运用它的影响来使紧张局势得以缓和。
                         ——法新社华盛顿电
    美国正指望苏联采取平行行动来帮助解决中东危机。
    克里姆林宫在周末已向华盛顿、耶路撒冷和开罗发出信息。……以色列人士说，耶路撒冷所接到的一个信息的语气比苏联人公开声称的来得缓和。
    ……大家的注意力都转向联合国，在那里美苏的平行行动结果都将会得到安理会的赞同。　
                        ——美国《华盛顿邮报》
    最近苏美的接触是频繁的：在莫斯科同美国大使汤姆森，在华盛顿同苏联代办尤里·切尔尼亚科夫。此外，许多联系是根据约翰逊和柯西金之间交换秘密信件来进行的。有关这方面的可靠东西迄今为止没有公开发表。　
                        ——德意志新闻社华盛顿电
    中东危机是联合国应该进行干涉的一个典型的局势……如果在中东发生冲突，大国显然一定会牵涉进去。
    我认为，苏联的利益和我们的是同样的。他们不希望发生对峙，他们知道局势是危险的。　
                        ——美国参议员富布赖特
    尽管苏联大肆宣传，美国官员经同莫斯科举行的私下会谈中感到，克里姆林宫并不想走得很远，以致于卷入直接的军事行动。
                        ——合众国际社记者汉斯莱
    英国外交大臣布朗呼吁苏联一起在中东重新建立联合国的存在以避免战争。
    布朗说，“我们希望苏联赞同我们为此而努力。……我们希望苏联将支持我们力促立即召开安理会会议”。
                        ——合众国际社莫斯科电
    布朗昨天（五月二十六日）从莫斯科回国，带回了俄国协助平息中东危机的秘密保证。
    毫无疑问，苏联的领导人在进行紧急的幕后尝试来约制埃及。
                        ——英国《每日镜报》
    布朗在莫斯科记者招待会上说，他同苏联领导人就中东问题进行了“十分充分、十分详尽、极为友好，而且是建设性的”讨论，这个讨论所根据的“与其说是事件的是非曲直，不如说是如何才能制止大火的爆发”。他认为，在莫斯科“有一种非常强烈和紧迫的使局势缓和下来的愿望”。
                        ——路透社莫斯科电
    莫斯科急于使（中东的）战争热平静下来……有强有力的迹象表明，莫斯科已表现出，它正对争端的埃及一方施加抑制的影响。……耶路撒冷（以色列首都）所接到的一个（苏联）信息的语气，比苏联人公开声称的来得缓和。　
                        ——美国《华盛顿邮报》
    今天，要是华盛顿想使以色列免受阿拉伯的进攻，那么，最快最便宜的办法是在莫斯科搞交易。……只有莫斯科能使这场危机不至于发展到狂暴和不可收拾的地步……如果莫斯科在适当的时机以柔和的态度把开罗往后拉……那么，华盛顿也将受到莫斯科的恩惠。　
                        ——美国《基督教科学箴言报》
