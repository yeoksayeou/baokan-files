Hong Kong patriots detest, despise, and scorn the British Empire. They resolutely counter the Hong Kong British authorities' so-called "emergency decree" banning the posting of inflammatory slogans, bravely defending big-character posters, and vowing to fight and expose the enemy.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 8th: The Hong Kong working class, with a fearless spirit, is resolutely countering the Hong Kong British authorities' recent decree banning the posting of inflammatory slogans. They say, "You have your emergency decree, I have my anti-violence actions." They bravely defend big-character posters, posting them to let more big-character posters appear in various places in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories.

On the evening of the 7th, workers from the "Star Ferry," Oil Street Ferry, and Kowloon Wharf held a joint struggle meeting against oppression. The "Star Ferry" workers, together with Hong Kong compatriots, used big-character posters as a new weapon to fight the Hong Kong British authorities, making them lose face. The Hong Kong British authorities, fearing the situation, hastily issued the ban and secretly dispatched police and agents onto the ships to tear down the posters. This fully exposes the paper tiger nature of the Hong Kong British authorities, showing that big-character posters are a powerful weapon to strike the enemy. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." The enemy is most afraid of big-character posters; if they tear them down, we will post even more, higher, and more eye-catching.

Around 7 PM on the 6th, nearly a hundred Hong Kong British "riot police" and "water police" arrived at the "Star Ferry" pier, stealthily tearing down the anti-British big-character posters and slogans posted by the workers. The workers immediately took retaliatory actions, starting from 10 PM, various ferries stopped sailing, and on the 7th, they continued to stop sailing to protest the Hong Kong British authorities' repeated unreasonable tearing down of big-character posters.

More than 3,000 workers at the Taikoo Dockyard stopped work on the 6th to protest the Hong Kong British authorities' collusion with the general manager, Cassels, in threatening workers who posted big-character posters. The workers forced Cassels and others to sign a document acknowledging the Taikoo Dockyard Workers' Struggle Committee's stern demands, ensuring that the workers' just actions would not be interfered with. On the 6th and 7th, many new combative big-character posters and slogans appeared inside the Taikoo Dockyard.

Workers at the Hong Kong Electric Company and the Chinese Electric Power Company's Hung Hom Power Station protested on the 6th against the Hong Kong British authorities tearing down workers' big-character posters. They reposted the posters all over the factory. The workers expressed their active response to the call of the great motherland, launching a movement to detest, despise, and scorn British imperialism, and were ready at any time to respond to the call of the great motherland to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism.

On the 7th, various places in Hong Kong and Kowloon, including the Mary Hospital opened by the Hong Kong British authorities, the Kowloon City Tunnel, the Tsz Wan Shan Resettlement Area, and other places, simultaneously appeared with big-character posters and slogans written in Chinese and English: "Smash the reactionary rule of the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Settle accounts with the Hong Kong British authorities' century of blood debts!" "Defeat the Hong Kong British fascist decrees!" "The Hong Kong British will be defeated! We will be victorious!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" These big-character posters and slogans showed the heroic spirit of Hong Kong patriots daring to scorn British imperialism.

    香港爱国同胞仇视鄙视蔑视英帝
    坚决反击港英当局颁布的所谓“禁贴煽动性标语”的“紧急法令”，英勇捍卫大字报，誓把敌人斗垮斗臭
    据新华社香港八日电　香港工人阶级正以天不怕、地不怕的大无畏精神，坚决反击港英当局最近颁布的所谓“禁贴煽动性标语”的“紧急法令”，他们说得好：“你有你的紧急法令，我有我的抗暴行动”，他们英勇地捍卫大字报，张贴大字报，要让更多的大字报出现在香港、九龙和新界各地。
    七日晚，“天星”渡轮、油麻地渡轮和九龙仓三个单位的工人，联合举行反迫害斗争大会。“天星”渡轮工人同香港同胞一起，运用大字报这个新式武器，斗得港英当局威风扫地。港英当局怕得要死，慌忙颁布禁贴“法令”，并偷偷摸摸出动警察、特务上船撕大字报。这正好说明港英当局纸老虎的虚弱本质，说明大字报是狠狠打击敌人的有力武器。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。敌人最害怕大字报，把它撕了，我们就要加倍地贴，要贴得更多、更高、更使人注目。
    六日晚上七时左右，近百名港英“防暴队”和“水警”，开到“天星”渡轮码头，摸黑把渡轮工人张贴的抗英大字报、标语撕去。工人们立即采取针锋相对的行动，从晚上十时起，各渡轮陆续停航，七日继续停航，抗议港英当局一再无理撕毁大字报。
    太古船坞三千多工人六日全部停工，抗议港英当局勾结这个厂的总经理卡素对工人贴大字报进行恐吓。工人们迫使卡素等人签字承认太古船坞工人斗委会的严正要求，保证工人的正义行动不受干涉。六日和七日，太古船坞内部出现了许多新的战斗性的大字报和标语。
   香港电灯公司和中华电力公司红磡发电厂的工人，六日分别抗议港英当局撕去工人们的大字报。他们把大字报重新贴满厂房内外。工人们表示积极响应伟大祖国号召，展开仇视、鄙视、蔑视英帝国主义的运动，随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，粉碎英帝国主义的反动统治。
    港九各地包括港英当局开设的玛丽医院以及九龙城隧道、慈云山徙置区等地，七日同时出现用油漆写的中、英文标语和大字报：“粉碎港英反动统治！”“清算港英百年血债！”“打垮港英法西斯法令！”“港英必败！我们必胜！”“毛主席万岁！”这些大字报和标语显示了香港爱国同胞敢于蔑视英帝国主义的英雄气概。
