Our Qinghai Province August 18 Revolutionary Rebel Alliance heard from the radio the exhilarating news from Beijing—our country’s first hydrogen bomb test was successful. This is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, another bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our hearts are filled with immense excitement, and we jumped for joy. The warriors of our August 18 Revolutionary Alliance, holding up giant portraits of Chairman Mao and carrying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," braved the rain to take to the streets, banging drums and gongs. We shouted and danced, and all our words boiled down to one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!

The success of this hydrogen bomb test greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary masses, greatly boosts the morale of the Chinese people, and greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people of the world. It deals a heavy blow to the nuclear blackmail policies of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. It is a powerful support for our brothers, the Vietnamese people, who are fighting on the front lines against U.S. aggression. It is a great encouragement to the Arab people in their anti-imperialist struggle, and it is a powerful support for the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their struggle against British oppression. This fully demonstrates that China is a strong bastion for defending world revolution.

The Chinese people keep their word. In just two years and eight months, we have successfully tested atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs. This speed is unprecedented in the world. Whatever the imperialists and modern revisionists have, we must have; whatever they do not have, we must also have. With Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds, we can create any miracle in the world.

Currently, the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province is entering a new stage of great criticism, great struggle, and great unity. At this critical moment when the revolutionary masses are seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, this exhilarating news has come as another great support and encouragement. We firmly declare: In the future, we will better study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, resolutely fight to overthrow, smash, and expose to shame the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their henchmen in Qinghai, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever on the Qinghai Plateau.

    文化大革命的又一辉煌成果
    青海省八·一八革命造反派联合委员会
    我们青海省八·一八革命组织，从广播里听到了从北京传来振奋人心的消息——我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了。这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命又一丰硕成果。我们的心情万分激动，高兴得跳了起来。我们八·一八革命组织的战士，高举毛主席巨幅画像，手拿《毛主席语录》，冒雨跑上街头，敲锣打鼓，大家喊呀，跳呀，千言万语汇成一句话：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    这次氢弹爆炸的成功，大长了我们无产阶级革命派的志气，大长了中国人民的志气，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。这是对美帝苏修核讹诈政策的沉重打击，这是对战斗在抗美最前线的兄弟的越南人民强有力的支持，是对正在反帝斗争中的阿拉伯人民的巨大鼓舞，也是对港九同胞反英抗暴斗争的强有力的支援。这充分说明：中国是保卫世界革命的坚强堡垒。
    中国人民说话是算数的。在短短的两年八个月的时间里，就试验成功了原子弹、导弹、氢弹，这种速度是世界上从来没有过的。帝国主义、现代修正主义有的，我们要有；它们没有的，我们也一定要有。用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。
    目前，我们青海省的文化大革命正进入大批判，大斗争，大联合的新阶段。在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，又传来了这个振奋人心的消息，这是对我们又一个巨大的支持，巨大的鼓舞。我们坚决表示：今后要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚决把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在青海的爪牙，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让伟大的毛泽东思想红旗，在青海高原上高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
