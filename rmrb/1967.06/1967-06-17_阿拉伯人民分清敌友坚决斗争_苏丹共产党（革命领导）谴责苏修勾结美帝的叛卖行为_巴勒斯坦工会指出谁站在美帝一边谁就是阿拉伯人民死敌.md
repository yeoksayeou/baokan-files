The Sudanese Communist Party (Revolutionary Leadership) condemns the treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionists colluding with U.S. imperialism. The Palestinian trade unions point out that whoever stands on the side of U.S. imperialism is an enemy of the Arab people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, June 15th: The Sudanese Communist Party (Revolutionary Leadership) issued a statement on June 10th, condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership for "betraying the Arab people."

The statement said that during the aggression war launched by U.S. and British imperialism and Israel against the Arab people, "the Soviet revisionist leadership is conspiring and colluding with U.S. imperialism."

"The Soviet leaders have betrayed the cause of the Arab people and stabbed them in the back at the most critical moment."

The statement listed numerous facts to illustrate the treacherous crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership. It said: "The friends of U.S. imperialism—the traitorous Soviet leaders, this shameful and despicable stance, exposes their evil nature. They not only oppose the national liberation movements in the Arab world but also oppose the national liberation movements throughout the world. These Soviet leaders—the running dogs of U.S. imperialism—although they claim to support the people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism, they have become open traitors. Therefore, we must always distinguish between our true friends and the friends of our enemies. The Soviet leaders are close friends of U.S. imperialism."

The Sudanese Communist Party (Revolutionary Leadership) recently also distributed a leaflet titled: "The New Soviet Leaders Are the True Allies of U.S. Imperialism." The leaflet said: "Let us raise the banner of self-reliance. Our struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool Israel will definitely achieve victory!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: Arab public opinion continues to condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. and British imperialism and their tool Israel, reaffirming the Arab people's determination to fight to the end and never surrender to the aggressors.

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* published a commentary on the 15th saying that this aggression has made us realize a very important issue. In the past, we did not hate and oppose international imperialism enough, the road is not so smooth. The imperialist aggressors are not only targeting the Arabs but also other countries' people. The people of the world will unite to oppose the common enemy.

The Egyptian newspaper *Al-Jumhuriya* editorial said that the Egyptian people no longer seek a middle way to solve the problem, and they will not allow their fate to be built on compromise.

The Palestinian Workers' Union recently issued a statement saying that now we have identified who our enemies are and who our friends are. Those who oppose U.S. imperialism are our true friends; those who stand on the side of the United States and collude with it are our enemies.

The statement said that Palestinian workers will continue the armed struggle—this is the only way to drive out the U.S., British, and Israeli aggressors.

    苏丹共产党（革命领导）谴责苏修勾结美帝的叛卖行为
    巴勒斯坦工会指出谁站在美帝一边谁就是阿拉伯人民死敌
    据新华社喀土穆十五日电　苏丹共产党（革命领导）在六月十日发表的一项声明中，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团“背叛了阿拉伯人民”。
    声明说，在美、英帝国主义和以色列对阿拉伯人民进行的侵略战争中，“苏联修正主义领导是同美帝国主义共谋和勾结在一起的”。
  “苏联领导人背叛了阿拉伯人民的事业，并且在最危急的时刻在阿拉伯人背后插上一刀。”
    声明列举许多事实来说明苏联修正主义领导的叛卖罪行。它说：“美帝国主义的朋友——背叛的苏联领导人，这种可耻的丑恶立场，暴露了他们罪恶的本性，他们不仅反对阿拉伯世界的民族解放运动，而且反对全世界的民族解放运动。这些苏联领导人——美帝国主义的走狗——尽管他们声称支持各国人民对帝国主义作斗争，但是他们已经成为公开的叛徒。因此，我们必须始终分清我们真正的朋友和我们敌人的朋友。苏联领导人是美帝国主义的亲密朋友。”
    苏丹共产党（革命领导）最近还散发了一份传单，标题是：《苏联新领导人是美帝国主义的真正同盟者》。传单说：“让我们高举起自力更生的旗帜。我们反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列的斗争，将一定取得胜利！”
    据新华社十六日讯　阿拉伯各国舆论继续谴责美英帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略罪行，重申阿拉伯人民决心战斗到底，决不向侵略者屈服。
    叙利亚《复兴报》十五日发表评论说，这次侵略使我们弄清楚了一个十分重要的问题。过去我们痛恨和反对国际帝国主义还不够，道路不是那么平坦的。帝国主义侵略者不仅是针对阿拉伯，而且还针对其他国家人民。全世界人民将团结起来反对共同的敌人。
    阿联《共和国报》的社论说，阿联人民不再寻求中间道路解决办法，他们也决不允许把他们的命运建立在妥协上面。
    巴勒斯坦工人联合会最近发表声明说，现在我们已经认清，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。凡是反对美帝国主义的，就是我们真正的朋友；凡是站在美国一边，并同它狼狈为奸的，就是我们的敌人。
    声明说，巴勒斯坦工人将继续进行武装斗争——这是赶走美英以侵略者的唯一途径。
