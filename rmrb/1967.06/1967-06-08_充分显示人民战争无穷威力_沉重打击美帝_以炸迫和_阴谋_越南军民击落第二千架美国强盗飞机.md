The Vietnamese military and civilians have shot down the second thousand U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The General Headquarters of the People's Army calls for advancing in victory to foil all U.S. imperialist plots of aggression.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi dated June 6, it was announced here on June 6: On June 5, the military and civilians of Thanh Hoa Province in North Vietnam shot down one invading U.S. aggressor aircraft and captured a live U.S. air pirate. This is the second thousand U.S. aggressor aircraft shot down by the military and civilians of North Vietnam since August 5, 1964, when the U.S. aggressors brazenly bombed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The glorious victory achieved by the military and civilians of North Vietnam is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' plot to expand the war of aggression and a heavy blow to the U.S.-Soviet collusion plot of "bombing to force negotiations." This glorious victory marks the complete failure of the U.S. imperialists' boasted "air superiority" and demonstrates the infinite power of people's war. This glorious victory greatly boosts the morale of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and greatly dampens the arrogance of U.S. imperialism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi dated June 7, the General Headquarters of the People's Army of Vietnam issued a statement on June 6 regarding the glorious victory of shooting down two thousand U.S. aggressor aircraft by the military and civilians of North Vietnam, calling on the military and civilians of Vietnam to advance in victory and resolutely foil all plots and means of aggression by the U.S. aggressors.

The statement said that the heroic northern military and civilians have foiled the U.S. aggressors' plot to expand the war and achieved glorious victories, shooting down two thousand U.S. aircraft, killing and capturing thousands of U.S. air pirates, and sinking or damaging seventy-three U.S. warships, landing craft, and puppet group speedboats.

The statement emphasized that the victories achieved by the military and civilians of North Vietnam in more than two years of anti-U.S. war are extremely great and comprehensive. This is also the extremely heavy and comprehensive failure of the U.S. aggressors.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. aggressors attacked the North, attempting to sabotage the socialist construction of our people, and to stop the support of the northern people for their compatriots in the South. However, our military and civilians are united, resolutely defending and building the socialist North, and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary cause of liberating the South.

The statement said that the U.S. aggressors have suffered a crushing defeat, but they are still stubborn and unwilling to give up their ambition to invade Vietnam. They are now crazily carrying out new military adventures, attempting to save their predicament. The statement calls on the military and civilians of Vietnam to advance in victory and resolutely foil all plots and means of aggression by the U.S. aggressors.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people's sacred war of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the nation is in a fierce stage. We still have to overcome many difficulties. However, our victories have never been as great as they are now, and our favorable conditions have never been as numerous as they are now. We will surely achieve a thorough victory.

The statement finally said that our people reaffirm the sacred oath of independence: "We are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure that our country will not be invaded and that we will not be slaves." With a sense of pride in fulfilling our historical mission to the nation and the people of the world, with unlimited confidence in the final victory, we remember and express the iron will of 31 million compatriots of Vietnam, as called by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, to unite as one, advance resolutely, bravely overcome all difficulties, and determine to defeat the U.S. aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and unify the country. The Vietnamese people will surely win! The U.S. aggressors will surely fail!
