The U.S. and the Soviet Union colluded to force Arab countries to "cease fire," and immediately after, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin personally went to the United States to further conspire with the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and the people of the world.

On June 19, Johnson and Kosygin delivered speeches at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly in Washington and the United Nations, respectively. These speeches were the opening remarks for their dirty dealings.

The public "dialogue" between the leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union was carefully arranged. The two speeches were delivered with a one-hour interval, covering global issues, with a focus on the Middle East problem, the Vietnam problem, and the issues of nuclear weapons and nuclear war. Their performance further exposed the true purpose of the Soviet revisionist group's proposal to convene an emergency session of the UN General Assembly, which was not to "support" Arab countries but to engage in larger-scale betrayal and collude with U.S. imperialism in a global deal.

It is clear to everyone that in the Middle East issue, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are conspiring to use the United Nations to implement their new colonialist plans to control Arab countries. Johnson openly demanded that the United Nations "take effective mediation actions" to force Arab countries to accept a series of humiliating conditions proposed by the United States, known as the "five principles." Kosygin immediately followed up, praising the "justice" and "impartiality" of the United Nations, urging Arab countries to believe that they can "rely on the United Nations to defend" their independence and sovereignty. The leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are using both coercion and deception to make Arab countries abandon their anti-aggression struggles and surrender to the invaders.

Kosygin, to cover up the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Arab people, pretended to be very concerned in the emergency session of the UN General Assembly, talking about "supporting" Arab countries, "condemning" Israel, and demanding that Israel "withdraw troops," and so on. In fact, all of this is false and worthless.

The Soviet leader tries to portray himself as a hero against aggression, but in his long and stinking speech, he does not even dare to mention the word "U.S. imperialism," the culprit behind the aggression against Arab countries. In his so-called draft resolution, there is not even a shadow of condemnation of the U.S. aggressors. Enough of this! You are originally the accomplices and lackeys of U.S. imperialism, how can you pretend to be heroes?

Kosygin talks about righteousness and morality, but he has evil intentions. You admitted that you knew the U.S. and Israel were going to launch an aggressive war, yet you did everything you could to lull the Arab people into a false sense of security, tying their hands and feet, making them unprepared for the sudden attack. When the Arab people rose up to fight the aggression, you colluded with the United States to pressure Arab countries to accept the "ceasefire." Yet Kosygin shamelessly said that this was a "great achievement" of the Security Council. Now, the invaders' iron hooves are still trampling on the land of Arab countries, and you not only do not allow the Arab people to resist the aggression, but you also want to force the American-style United Nations shackles onto the necks of Arab countries. The Soviet revisionist group has done so much harm to the Arab people, yet still claims to "firmly protect" Arab countries. Isn't this like a weasel visiting the chicken coop with evil intentions?

It is also clear to everyone that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are conspiring again on the Vietnam issue, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war. Johnson declared in his speech that the United States is prepared to "gradually reduce the level of fighting" in Vietnam, attempting to lure the Vietnamese people into laying down their arms. Kosygin immediately proposed that as long as the United States "stops bombing," it can "peacefully resolve" the issue, vigorously helping the U.S. aggressors to promote the "stop bombing and negotiate" fraud.

Kosygin shouted that the continuation of the Vietnam War "poses a serious danger of turning this conflict into a broad military conflict among the major powers," using this to intimidate all countries that truly support the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war, especially China. Let me tell the Soviet revisionist traitors, the Chinese people have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war as their sacred internationalist duty. We firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, fighting until the final victory. If the U.S. aggressors dare to expand the war and insist on confronting the Chinese people, then the Chinese people will not hesitate to use their strength and, together with the Vietnamese people, annihilate the U.S. aggressors. You think you can use U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war to intimidate the great Vietnamese people and the Chinese people, but this only proves that you are a bunch of traitors and cowards!

The leaders of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are also making a big deal out of the issue of nuclear weapons. Johnson urged the Soviet revisionists to quickly sign the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" and the "Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty" with the United States to maintain their nuclear hegemony. Kosygin immediately picked up this topic and elaborated on it. He repeated Khrushchev's nonsense, exaggerating the "destructive" nature of nuclear war, engaging in nuclear blackmail, and attempting to extinguish the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. However, the Soviet revisionists' tricks are in vain. Your nuclear monopoly has already failed, and your nuclear blackmail no longer works. In the eyes of the revolutionary people of the world, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are all paper tigers. The truly powerful force is the revolutionary force, the power of the people. It is not the revolutionary people who fear you, but you who fear the revolutionary people.

Johnson and Kosygin's coordinated speeches further prove that the Soviet revisionist group is a great traitor to the people of the world, a great accomplice to U.S. imperialism in suppressing world revolution. U.S. imperialism is very pleased with the role played by the Soviet revisionist group. Johnson praised the Soviet revisionists in his speech, saying that their services are "extremely important" to the United States, and openly proposed hoping that the Soviet revisionists would expand the scope of "joint actions" with the United States. Kosygin's speech has already responded positively to Johnson. The purpose of his hurried trip to the United States this time was to expand U.S.-Soviet "joint actions," adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialism, and serve U.S. imperialism.

Kosygin went to the United Nations at a time when the Soviet revisionist group's betrayal of the Arab people was strongly condemned by the people of the world. He originally intended to use some fancy words to gain some capital to cover up the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists. However, traitors are traitors, and strikebreakers are strikebreakers. On major issues of international class struggle, in the sharp struggle between the revolutionary people of the world and imperialism and reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist group will inevitably stand on the side of imperialism and reactionaries and will inevitably continue to expose its traitorous and strikebreaking face.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialism's threats." The same applies to the Soviet revisionist traitors. The Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and the people of the world understand that as long as they remain vigilant, dare to fight, are not afraid of difficulties, and press on courageously, they will surely achieve great victories. What about the U.S. imperialists, what about the Soviet revisionists, all demons and monsters will all be thrown into the dustbin of history!

### 美苏扩大“共同行动”的开场白

    美苏扩大“共同行动”的开场白
    美苏串通一气迫使阿拉伯国家“停火”之后，苏修头目柯西金立即亲自出马到美国，同美帝国主义头子约翰逊进一步策划镇压越南人民、阿拉伯人民和世界革命人民的反革命大阴谋。
    六月十九日，约翰逊和柯西金分别在华盛顿和联合国大会紧急会议上发表的演说，就是他们进行这场肮脏交易的开场白。
    美苏头目的这次公开“对话”，是经过精心安排的。两个演说相差一小时，内容都涉及全球性的问题，而重点又都是中东问题、越南问题以及核武器和核战争问题，一唱一和，十分合拍。他们的这番表演，进一步揭穿了苏修集团提议召开联大紧急会议的目的，根本不是什么“支持”阿拉伯国家，而是要干更大规模的叛卖勾当，同美帝国主义进行一场全球性的大交易。
    人们看得很清楚，在中东问题上，美苏两家正在共谋继续利用联合国，来推行它们控制阿拉伯国家的新殖民主义计划。约翰逊在讲话中公然要联合国“作出有效的谋和活动”，迫使阿拉伯国家接受美国一系列丧权辱国的条件，即所谓“五大原则”。柯西金紧紧跟上，大肆吹捧联合国的“公道”和“仗义执言”，要阿拉伯国家相信可以“指望联合国来保卫”它们的独立和主权。美苏的头目这样又压又骗，无非是要阿拉伯国家放弃反侵略斗争，向侵略强盗屈膝投降。
    柯西金为了掩盖苏修对阿拉伯人民的背叛，在联大紧急会议上装模作样，大谈什么“支持”阿拉伯国家，“谴责”以色列，要以色列“撤军”，等等。其实，这统统都是假的，都是一文不值的。
    苏修头目想把自己打扮成反侵略的英雄，可是在他的又臭又长的讲话中，连侵略阿拉伯国家的罪魁祸首美帝国主义的字眼都不敢提一下，在他提出的所谓决议草案中连谴责美国侵略者的影子都没有。算了吧，你们本来就是美帝国主义的帮凶和奴才，怎么能充得了好汉呢？
    柯西金满口仁义道德，肚子里是歹毒心肠。你们自己承认早就知道美以要发动侵略战争，可是，你们却千方百计地麻痹阿拉伯人民的警惕性，捆住他们的手脚，使他们在突然袭击下，措手不及。在阿拉伯人民起来进行反侵略战争的时候，你们又伙同美国压迫阿拉伯国家接受“停火”。而柯西金居然恬不知耻地说，这是安理会的“不小的功劳”。现在，侵略者的铁蹄还在践踏着阿拉伯国家的土地，你们不仅不许阿拉伯人民反抗侵略，而且还要把美国牌的联合国这副枷锁硬套在阿拉伯国家的脖子上。苏修集团对阿拉伯人民干尽了坏事，却还口口声声要“坚决保护”阿拉伯国家，这不是黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，心怀叵测吗？
    人们也看得很清楚，美苏两家在越南问题上又在进行新的勾结，企图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的烈火。约翰逊在讲话中扬言美国准备在越南“使战斗逐步降级”，妄图诱使越南人民放下武器。而柯西金马上就提出，只要美国“停止轰炸”，就可以“和平解决”，竭力帮助美国侵略者推行“停炸诱和”的骗局。
    柯西金大嚷大叫“越南战争的继续”，“孕育着把这一冲突变成各大国广泛军事冲突的严重危险”，借以恫吓一切真正支持越南人民抗美救国战争的国家，特别是中国。老实告诉苏修叛徒集团，中国人民从来就把支持越南人民抗美救国战争看作是自己神圣的国际主义义务。我们坚决支持越南人民打到底，打到最后胜利。如果美国侵略强盗胆敢扩大战火，硬要同中国人民较量，那么，中国人民决不会吝惜自己的力量，一定同越南人民一起，消灭美国侵略者。你们妄想用美帝国主义扩大战争来吓唬伟大的越南人民和中国人民，这只能证明你们是一伙地地道道的叛徒，不折不扣的怕死鬼！
    美帝和苏修头目还在核武器问题上大作文章。约翰逊督促苏修赶快同美国签订“防止扩散核武器条约”和“反弹道导弹协定”，来维持它们的核霸王地位。而柯西金马上接过这个题目，大加发挥。他重弹赫鲁晓夫的滥调，大肆渲染核战争的“毁灭性”，大搞核讹诈，妄图扑灭世界人民的革命斗争。但是，苏修叛徒的这一套是枉费心机的。你们的核垄断早已破产了，你们的核讹诈也早已不灵了。在世界革命人民看来，帝国主义、修正主义和反动派统统都是纸老虎。真正强大的是革命的力量，是人民的力量。不是革命的人民怕你们，而是你们害怕革命人民。
    约翰逊和柯西金一唱一和的讲话，进一步证明了苏修集团是出卖世界人民的大叛徒，是美帝国主义镇压世界革命的大帮凶。对苏修集团所起的这种作用，美帝国主义是十分欣赏的。约翰逊在他的讲话中夸奖苏修说，他们的效劳对美国是“极为重要的”，并且公开提出希望苏修扩大同美国“共同行动的领域”。柯西金的讲话已经对约翰逊表示积极响应。他这次风尘仆仆地跑到美国去，其目的就是为了扩大美苏的“共同行动”，适应美帝国主义需要，为美帝国主义奔走效劳。
    柯西金是在苏修集团对阿拉伯人民的背叛行为遭到全世界人民强烈谴责的情况下，到联合国去的。他本来企图用一些漂亮的言词来捞取一些资本，以掩盖苏修的叛徒面目。但是，叛徒总归是叛徒，工贼总归是工贼。在国际阶级斗争的重大问题上，在世界革命人民同帝国主义和反动派的尖锐斗争面前，苏修集团必然要站到帝国主义和反动派一边，必然要不断地暴露出它的叛徒和工贼的面目。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”对于苏修叛徒集团也应该这样。越南人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界人民懂得，只要提高警惕，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，就一定能够取得伟大的胜利。什么美帝，什么苏修，一切妖魔鬼怪，都将统统被送进历史的垃圾堆！
