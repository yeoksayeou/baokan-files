The Burmese government incited mobs to repeatedly attack our embassy, kill our experts, and persecute our overseas Chinese.

Our government has lodged the most urgent and strongest protest with the Burmese government.

In a note, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sternly questioned the Burmese government as to what position it intends to place itself in and what it wants to do to the relations between the two countries. It demanded that the Burmese government immediately take emergency measures to stop the further deterioration of the situation, ensure the safety of the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions, Chinese personnel responsible for Chinese loan projects in Burma, and Chinese nationals, return the stolen Chinese national emblem, and severely punish the culprits.

New China News Agency, June 28th: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong summoned the Burmese Ambassador to China, Thin Maung, on the 28th and handed him a note of protest from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese government, in the note, strongly protested to the Burmese government for inciting and conniving with mobs to attack the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions on the 26th and 27th, insult the great leader of the Chinese people, steal the Chinese national emblem, and a series of brutal persecutions of overseas Chinese since the 22nd. The Chinese government demanded that the Burmese government immediately take emergency measures to stop the further deterioration of the situation, ensure the safety of the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions, Chinese personnel responsible for Chinese loan projects in Burma, and Chinese nationals, return the stolen Chinese national emblem, and severely punish the culprits. The Chinese government also reserved the right to demand compensation for all losses from the Burmese government.

Vice Minister Han Nianlong strongly protested to the Burmese government for the mob's even more frenzied and barbaric attack on the Chinese Embassy on the 28th, which resulted in the on-the-spot killing of Chinese expert Liu Yi, and declared the right to further negotiations.

The full text of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs note is as follows:

To the Embassy of the Union of Burma in China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sends the following note to the Embassy of the Union of Burma in China:

According to reports from the Chinese Embassy in Burma, on June 26th, about two thousand Burmese mobs, incited and connived by the Burmese authorities, attacked the former Nanyang Middle School and the former Overseas Chinese Middle School, beating up overseas Chinese students and their visiting parents. Many overseas Chinese were injured, and at least one person was killed on the spot. Diplomatic personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Burma rushed to the scene but were subjected to unreasonable insults by the mobs, and their car was also damaged.

On the evening of June 26th, the early morning and noon of June 27th, mobs numbering from several hundred to over a thousand repeatedly attacked the Chinese Embassy in Burma and its residences, as well as the Xinhua News Agency's Yangon branch and the Civil Aviation Administration of China's Yangon office. These mobs rushed into the compounds, causing extensive damage to buildings and even setting fires. What is particularly unacceptable is that these mobs insulted the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and stole the national emblem of the People's Republic of China.

During the mobs' attacks on the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions, Burmese military and police stood by and did nothing. Despite repeated requests from the Chinese Embassy for the Burmese government to take measures to ensure the safety of the embassy, the Burmese government ignored them, allowing the situation to escalate, and even threatened Chinese embassy personnel not to leave the embassy. Burmese armed military and police also participated in the suppression of overseas Chinese students.

At the same time, Burmese mobs looted the property of overseas Chinese in Yangon's Chinese residential areas, brutally beat up overseas Chinese, and some overseas Chinese were severely injured and killed. A white terror of anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese sentiments engulfed the overseas Chinese residential areas.

Recently, various circumstances indicate that the series of serious incidents in which Burmese mobs attacked the Chinese Embassy in Burma and other Chinese institutions and brutally persecuted overseas Chinese were entirely planned by the Burmese government.

On June 22nd, the Burmese school authorities of the former Chinese Girls' School in Yangon forcibly removed the Mao Zedong badges worn by overseas Chinese students and publicly insulted the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, which aroused great indignation among overseas Chinese students. On June 23rd, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Burma protested to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this incident, pointing out that overseas Chinese wearing badges of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, is a legitimate right of overseas Chinese, and no one can take it away, and demanded that the Burmese government guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again. However, the Burmese government did not take necessary steps to prevent the escalation of the situation but instead announced on June 23rd the closure of the former Chinese Girls' School and the former Overseas Chinese Girls' School. Afterwards, according to reports, the Burmese authorities also indefinitely closed nine overseas Chinese middle schools and primary schools. Thus, the curtain was raised on this round of comprehensive anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese movement.

The Chinese government believes that the series of incidents in which the Burmese government incited and connived with mobs to insult the great leader of the Chinese people, attack the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions, steal the Chinese national emblem, and brutally persecute overseas Chinese have seriously damaged the friendly relations between China and Burma and grossly violated internationally recognized principles of international relations. We must ask, what position does the Burmese government intend to place itself in, and what does it want to do to the relations between the two countries? The Chinese government strongly protests to the Burmese government for this and demands that the Burmese government immediately take emergency measures to stop the further deterioration of the situation, ensure the safety of the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions, Chinese personnel responsible for Chinese loan projects in Burma, and Chinese nationals, return the stolen Chinese national emblem, and severely punish the culprits. The Chinese government also reserves the right to demand compensation for all losses from the Burmese government.

It must be pointed out that the friendly relations between China and Burma are in the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries. If the Burmese government ignores the wishes of the broad masses of the Burmese people, persists in its course, and continues to implement its crazy anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese policy, then all the serious consequences that follow must be borne entirely by the Burmese government.

    缅甸政府唆使暴徒连续袭击我使馆杀害我专家迫害我侨胞
    我政府向缅甸政府提出最紧急最强烈抗议
    我外交部在照会中，严正质问缅甸政府到底要把自己置于什么地位，要把两国关系搞到什么地步？要求缅甸政府立即采取紧急措施，制止事态的进一步恶化，保证中国大使馆和其他中国机构、中国派往缅甸负责中国贷款工程的人员和中国侨民人身和财产的安全，归还被劫去的中国国徽，严惩凶手。
    新华社二十八日讯　外交部副部长韩念龙二十八日召见缅甸驻华大使信瓦瑙，向他提交一份中国外交部的抗议照会。中国政府在照会中就缅甸政府唆使和纵容暴徒，在二十六日和二十七日连续袭击中国大使馆和其他中国机构，侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖、劫走中国国徽，以及从二十二日以来发生的一系列残酷迫害华侨的事件，向缅甸政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。中国政府要求缅甸政府立即采取紧急措施，制止事态的进一步恶化，保证中国大使馆和其他中国机构、中国派往缅甸负责中国贷款工程的人员和中国侨民的人身和财产的安全，归还被劫去的中国国徽，严惩凶手。中国政府并且保留要求缅甸政府赔偿一切损失的权利。
    韩念龙副部长就缅甸暴徒二十八日更加疯狂、更加野蛮地袭击中国大使馆、当场杀害中国专家刘逸的严重事件，向缅甸政府提出最强烈的抗议，并且声明保留进一步提出交涉的权利。
    中国外交部照会的全文如下：缅甸联邦驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部照会缅甸联邦驻华大使馆，并申述如下：
    据中国驻缅甸大使馆报告，六月二十六日，约两千名缅甸暴徒在缅甸当局的唆使和纵容下袭击了原南洋中学、原华侨中学，毒打华侨学生和去探望他们的家长，华侨多人受伤，至少有一人当场死亡。中国驻缅甸大使馆外交人员闻讯赶去，竟受到暴徒的无理凌辱，他们乘坐的汽车也被暴徒砸坏。
    六月二十六日晚、二十七日清晨和中午，多达数百至一千余名的缅甸暴徒又多次袭击了中国驻缅甸大使馆和它的各住地以及新华社驻仰光分社和中国民用航空总局驻仰光办事处等机构。这些暴徒冲进院内，大肆破坏建筑物，甚至纵火焚烧。特别令人不能容忍的是，这些暴徒竟然侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，并抢去中华人民共和国国徽。
    在暴徒袭击中国大使馆和其他中国机构的过程中，在场的缅甸军警袖手旁观。尽管中国大使馆一再要求缅甸政府采取措施保证使馆安全，缅甸政府却置之不理，听任事态扩大，甚至威胁中国大使馆人员不要走出使馆。缅甸武装军警并参预了对华侨学生的镇压。
    与此同时，缅甸暴徒还在仰光华侨居住地区抢劫华侨财产，残暴殴打华侨，有的华侨重伤致死。一片反华、排华的白色恐怖笼罩着华侨居住地区。
    最近，各种情况表明，缅甸暴徒袭击中国驻缅甸大使馆以及中国其他机构并残酷迫害华侨的一系列严重事件，完全是缅甸政府所蓄意策划的。
    六月二十二日，仰光原中国女子中学的缅甸学校当局，强行剥去华侨学生佩带的毛主席像章，并公然侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，激起华侨学生极大的愤慨。六月二十三日，中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办就这一事件向缅甸政府外交部提出抗议，指出华侨佩带中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像章，是华侨的正当权利，任何人都不能加以剥夺，并且要求缅甸政府保证今后不再发生类似事件。但是，缅甸政府不仅没有采取必要步骤防止事态的扩大，反而于六月二十三日宣布封闭原中国女子中学和原华侨女子中学。此后，据消息报道，缅甸当局又无限期关闭了九所华侨中学和小学。这样，就揭开了这一次全面反华、排华运动的序幕。
    中国政府认为，缅甸政府唆使和纵容暴徒侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖、袭击中国大使馆和其他中国机构、劫走中国国徽、残酷迫害华侨的一系列事件，严重地损害了中缅两国的友好关系，粗暴地破坏了公认的国际关系准则。我们要问，缅甸政府到底要把自己置于什么地位，要把两国关系搞到什么地步？中国政府就此向缅甸政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议，并且要求缅甸政府立即采取紧急措施，制止事态的进一步恶化，保证中国大使馆和其他中国机构、中国派往缅甸负责中国贷款工程的人员和中国侨民人身和财产的安全，归还被劫去的中国国徽，严惩凶手。中国政府并保留要求缅甸政府赔偿一切损失的权利。
    必须指出，中缅两国友好关系是符合两国人民的根本利益的。如果缅甸政府置广大缅甸人民的愿望于不顾，一意孤行，继续执行疯狂的反华排华政策，那么，由此而引起的一切严重后果，必须由缅甸政府承担全部责任。
