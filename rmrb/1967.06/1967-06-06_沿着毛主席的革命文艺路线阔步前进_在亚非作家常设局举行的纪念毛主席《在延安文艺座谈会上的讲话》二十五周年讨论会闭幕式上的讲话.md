Comrades and friends,

Please allow me to extend the warmest congratulations to the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau for holding the "Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" discussion meeting. Over the past few days, comrades have made many outstanding speeches, which have greatly inspired and educated us.

This meeting fully reflects the love of the world's revolutionary people for our great leader Chairman Mao and for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Cultural Revolution Group express their thanks to the comrades and friends who participated in this meeting. Comrade Jiang Qing originally planned to speak, but she has been sick with a cold these days and cannot speak. Today, she should still be resting, but to congratulate this meeting and to see the comrades and friends, she came anyway. She specially instructed me to greet the comrades and friends in my speech and to extend revolutionary greetings to the cultural warriors from the six continents!

The "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" by Chairman Mao was born in the midst of the storm of national liberation struggles. At that time, China was in the most arduous period of the War of Resistance Against Japan; it was also the time when our Party was opposing the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming and carrying out the great rectification movement. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large number of patriotic and revolutionary intellectuals broke through numerous blockades and came to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. The reactionary Kuomintang, in order to sabotage the people's war of resistance, also sent a small group of spies and Trotskyites to infiltrate Yan'an, colluding with a small group of anti-party elements and traitors to launch a reactionary countercurrent on the cultural front. They propagated bourgeois literary theories, advocating "even the sun has black spots" and "the task of literature has always been to expose," and other fallacies, inciting people to oppose the Party and the people. Thus, the literary and artistic workers were faced with a very sharp question: should literature and art serve the struggle for national liberation and people's liberation? Or should they serve the reactionary forces that sabotage the war of resistance and betray the country? Should they serve the revolution? Or should they serve the counter-revolution?

At this time, our great leader Chairman Mao, at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, delivered a speech of epoch-making historical significance. Chairman Mao's speech, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist literary theory, proposing a complete, systematic, and correct proletarian revolutionary literary line for the proletariat in the midst of struggle.

In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao first raised and solved the problem of the relationship between literature and politics. Chairman Mao pointed out: proletarian literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat. The revolutionary literary and artistic troops are an army fighting for national liberation and people's liberation, an army seizing power. Chairman Mao said: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, and among them, it can be said that there are both military and cultural fronts. We must first rely on the army that holds guns. But having only this kind of army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Proletarian literature and art is "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

To fundamentally solve the problem of the relationship between literature and art and politics, Chairman Mao pointed out in the speech: we must first solve the problem of the stance of literary and artistic workers. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers should stand on the side of the proletariat and the masses of the people. They must expose the brutality and deception of the enemy and point out their inevitable fate of failure. Towards the people, they should sing the praises of their labor and struggle; towards their shortcomings and mistakes, they should not ridicule or oppose, but should help them fight against their own shortcomings and mistakes, so that they can unite, progress, and strengthen their confidence in the victory of the struggle.

On the basis of solving the problem of stance, Chairman Mao proposed the fundamental direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. Chairman Mao called on literary and artistic workers to go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to learn from them, to thoroughly transform their worldview, and to "shift their position to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat." Chairman Mao said: "Literary and artistic workers of intellectual origin, in order to make their works welcomed by the masses, must change their thoughts and feelings, must undergo a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place."

Chairman Mao creatively applied and developed Marxist epistemology, deeply discussing the relationship between the source and flow of literature and art. Chairman Mao pointed out: people's lives are the only source of literature and art. Ancient and foreign literary works are not the source but the flow. The inheritance and borrowing of past literary works cannot replace one's own creation. A literary and artistic worker with a bright future must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the only broad and rich source, to create truly revolutionary literary and artistic works.

Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for proletarian literary criticism, proposing the principle of political standards first, artistic standards second. Chairman Mao's speech also ruthlessly refuted the erroneous and reactionary arguments of "human nature" and "love for humanity."

After the publication of this brilliant work, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, under the guidance of this revolutionary literary line, clarified their combat objectives, found their direction, eliminated the influence of Wang Ming's right-opportunist line, and repelled the counter-revolutionary tide of a small group of anti-party elements, Trotskyites, and traitors. Many outstanding literary and artistic workers, following Chairman Mao's instructions, used literature and art as a weapon to serve the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and in the flames of national liberation and people's liberation, tempered themselves into steadfast revolutionary fighters.

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the program of our unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution today. The speech prepared a comprehensive and systematic theory, line, policy, and guideline for our proletarian cultural revolution.

After the proletariat seized power, the overthrown exploiting class did not resign itself to death. The exploiting class, relying on extensive international connections, relying on the spontaneous capitalist forces of small-scale production, and relying on the various positions they occupied in the ideological realm of culture, art, philosophy, law, and so on, desperately carried out restoration activities. Lenin said: "The transition from capitalism to communism is a whole historical epoch. As long as this epoch has not ended, the exploiters will inevitably harbor hopes of restoration and turn these hopes into restoration actions. The overthrown exploiters did not expect to be overthrown, they do not believe this, they do not want to think about this, so after suffering the first serious defeat, they fight with tenfold efforts, mad enthusiasm, and a hundredfold increase in hatred to desperately struggle to restore their 'paradise' that they have lost, to protect their families that used to live sweetly but are now impoverished and bankrupt (or engaged in 'ordinary' labor...) by the 'ordinary rabble'." To defeat the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of the class enemy, the proletariat must use proletarian dictatorship to fight against the enemy. In the struggle between restoration and anti-restoration under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, ideology is a frontline position. Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces first clash on this frontline of ideology. After the proletariat seized power in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, they did not carry out a good ideological revolution, did not destroy the ideology of the exploiting class; on the contrary, they allowed capitalist and revisionist thoughts to spread rampantly, destroying the socialist economic base, corrupting the proletarian dictatorship, and ultimately leading to the restoration of capitalism today. Chairman Mao, based on the historical lessons of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, summed up the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship at home and abroad, personally initiated and led the proletarian cultural revolution.

China's proletarian cultural revolution, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, mobilized hundreds of millions of people to use the proletarian great democracy of big debates, big-character posters, big speeches, and big discussions to carry out a great revolution of self-liberation. This great revolution is a decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. One of the great historical achievements of this great revolution is to expose the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the key departments of our Party Central Committee, to seize back the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers that they usurped, and to smash their capitalist restoration plot.

China's proletarian cultural revolution has greatly developed Marxism-Leninism. It reveals to people a new and universal truth: in a socialist society, in the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship, class struggle does not die out but continues to deepen with the struggle between restoration and anti-restoration as its main content; the revolution does not end but continues in new forms. In the new era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory, as a true Marxist-Leninist, one must not only acknowledge class struggle but also acknowledge proletarian dictatorship; one must acknowledge that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, there exists a struggle between restoration and anti-restoration. Chairman Mao's theory of carrying out a cultural revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship points the way for the international communist movement and is a beacon for the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the proletariat in various countries.

China's proletarian cultural revolution has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of the world. Comrades of the revolutionary proletariat say: "The proletarian cultural revolution, which has already achieved decisive victory, will be recorded in history as the greatest event of epoch-making significance in the world. In the proletarian cultural revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, with rare talent and foresight, solved many problems that had not been solved before, thereby greatly enriching the great treasury of Marxism-Leninism." Many comrades at this meeting said well: "China's proletarian cultural revolution has shattered the beautiful dreams of the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. This makes China a stronger fortress of the world proletarian revolution and a more glorious vanguard of the oppressed nations and peoples."

The earth-shaking proletarian cultural revolution in China has frightened the imperialist and revisionist masters of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. They saw from the irresistible torrent of the proletarian cultural revolution that they themselves were destined to die. They picked up the broken weapons of German Fascist Goebbels, using slander and defamation to attack the proletarian cultural revolution in China in various ways.

In this frenzied abuse, it is particularly worth noting that the Soviet revisionist clique played the most despicable role. They used the most vulgar language of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits to attack our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. They instructed a notorious cultural clown to write black poems, madly abusing Chairman Mao. Recently, the Soviet revisionists also held a cultural black meeting that symbolizes the death of modern revisionist decadent culture, fiercely attacking Chairman Mao. Being opposed by the enemy is not a bad thing but a great thing. Their vicious attacks on Chairman Mao prove even more that the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao is great and correct. The great helmsman of the proletarian revolution, Chairman Mao, not only pointed out the direction and path for the Chinese revolution but also for the people under modern revisionist rule, who also consider Chairman Mao to have pointed out the direction and path for their revolution. Modern revisionists are afraid that the people under their rule will be influenced by the proletarian cultural revolution in China, grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, rise up in rebellion, and overthrow them. Therefore, they will use various despicable means to slander and attack Chairman Mao. Isn't that so? Then, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like, do you dare to publish Chairman Mao's articles, publish the editorials and documents of the proletarian cultural revolution in China, and tell the true situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in China to the Soviet people without any omissions? Do you dare to let the Soviet people use the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big speeches, and big discussions to criticize you? You dare not do this, screaming all day in the dark corners, what kind of "heroes" are you?

Chairman Mao's poem says: "The small globe, a few flies bumping into the wall. Buzzing, a few shrill cries, a few sobs." The Soviet revisionists' attacks and abuses on our great leader Chairman Mao are merely the last few shrill sobs of a few flies at the end of their rope, causing no harm to the brilliance of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The imperialists and revisionists of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union say that "you are destroying traditional culture" and "adopting a sectarian attitude of contempt towards the cultural achievements of the world," etc. This is purely a vicious slander against our proletarian cultural revolution.

We have always adopted an analytical attitude towards ancient and foreign cultures. Chairman Mao taught: "We must inherit all excellent literary and artistic heritage, critically absorb all beneficial things from it, as a reference for creating works from the people's lives here and now. There is a difference between having this reference and not having it, here there is a distinction between civilization and barbarism, between refinement and coarseness, between high and low, between fast and slow. Therefore, we must never reject the inheritance and reference of the ancients and foreigners, even if they are from the feudal ruling class and the bourgeoisie. However, inheritance and reference must not become a substitute for our own creation, this is something that cannot be substituted." Chairman Mao also instructed us: "We must distinguish between the decayed things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent people's culture of the ancients, which is more or less democratic and revolutionary."

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, on the one hand, we critically inherit the revolutionary, progressive, and excellent parts of traditional culture, that is, we absorb the essence; on the other hand, we criticize and eliminate the decayed, backward, and reactionary parts of traditional culture, that is, we remove the dregs. Towards the decayed, backward, and reactionary feudal culture and capitalist culture, that is, the dregs of "traditional culture," we indeed want to thoroughly destroy them. If we do not destroy them, capitalism will restore, revisionism will spread, and the cause of the proletarian revolution will fail. If we do not destroy them, new proletarian revolutionary culture cannot be established. Chairman Mao taught us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle. 'Destruction' is criticism, is revolution. 'Destruction' must be reasonable, and being reasonable is construction. 'Destruction' comes first, and 'construction' is also within it." However, if one thinks that while we are destroying the decayed, backward, and reactionary feudal and bourgeois culture, and destroying the imperialist and modern revisionist culture, we are also destroying all the excellent cultural heritage of history, that is purely a complete fabrication.

Critically inheriting "traditional culture" is what Chairman Mao said, "using the past for the present." The facts prove that only by critically inheriting can we discard the things that hinder our progress, absorb the useful things from it, and create a new people's culture. The ancient Peking opera is not already in a state of decay and decline? But the revolutionary pioneers of China's proletarian cultural revolution, under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, have made this old Peking opera regain new youth and life, creating model Peking operas such as "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Red Detachment of Women," "The Harbor," and "The Red Guards Attack the White Tiger Regiment." These model works, from the moment they appeared, were welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, in stark contrast to the cold and desolate situation of past Peking opera performances. This does not prove that the imperialists and modern revisionists' slander of "destroying traditional culture" in the Chinese Cultural Revolution is thoroughly bankrupt?

Comrade Jiang Qing, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, learns a little and uses a little, works hard, turning ancient art into a jewel that dispels the dark rule of the old stage; driving the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies who ruled the stage off the stage, letting the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers shine brightly, and turning the inverted history back to its rightful place. This fact fully proves that only Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line is the true protector of all excellent traditional culture!

As for the accusation of "adopting a sectarian attitude of contempt towards the cultural achievements of the world," that is not us but the imperialists and modern revisionists. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the highest cultural achievements in the world. Imperialists prohibit their propagation, and modern revisionists distort, falsify, and castrate Marxism-Leninism, even sealing up the works of the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, not allowing them to be spread; not to mention Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, even the ancient dialectics and materialism, they do not want them. Is this respecting the cultural achievements of the world? Imperialists and modern revisionists abandon the true traditional art of the world's people, vigorously promoting decadent and reactionary capitalist "art," is this respecting the cultural achievements of the world?

It is precisely the imperialists and modern revisionists who slander us as "sectarian" who truly respect the cultural achievements of the world. Chairman Mao taught us: "China should absorb a large amount of progressive foreign culture as raw material for its own culture, ... for example, the culture of the enlightenment period of various capitalist countries, all the things we can use today, we should absorb. But all foreign things, like our attitude towards food, must be chewed and digested by our own mouths and stomachs, sent into saliva, stomach juice, and intestinal juice, and decomposed into essence and dregs, then excrete the dregs and absorb the essence, only then can it be beneficial to our body, we must not swallow it raw and undigested without any criticism." Chairman Mao also said: "Towards foreign culture, the policy of exclusivism is wrong, we should absorb as much progressive foreign culture as possible, as a mirror for developing China's new culture." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have humbly learned and critically absorbed progressive foreign culture. A batch of cultural revolution warriors, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, have transformed the ancient ballet and symphony music of foreign countries, creating brilliant art treasures: the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," "The White-Haired Girl," and the symphony "The Red Detachment of Women," are not powerful proofs of this? The ironclad facts show that the so-called "adopting a sectarian attitude of contempt towards the cultural achievements of the world" is completely slander!

The imperialists and modern revisionists unanimously attack our proletarian cultural revolution for "knocking down all intellectuals," which is purely slander. Intellectuals belong to various classes and have different political stances. One type is the proletarian intellectuals who have accepted Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and united with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they are the core force of the proletarian cultural revolution. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, we must cultivate this type of intellectuals. Another type is those whose worldview has not been fundamentally transformed, or has not been well transformed, but who are basically patriotic and support the Party and socialism; these two types are the majority. There is also a type of intellectual who is treacherous, reactionary, and stubbornly insists on the capitalist road of counter-revolutionary revisionism; this is a small minority. In the proletarian cultural revolution, we must knock down only this small group of anti-communist, anti-people reactionary intellectuals. Towards them, we absolutely cannot "show mercy," because they are the "enemies without guns" who undermine the foundations of socialism, the special forces of imperialism and modern revisionism in socialist China. If we do not expose these anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary intellectuals, if we do not thoroughly criticize their counter-revolutionary revisionist words and deeds, if we do not fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to the end, then in the future, there will be a capitalist restoration like the Soviet revisionist leadership, causing harm to our socialist cause.

Our Party has always attached great importance to revolutionary intellectuals. Chairman Mao often taught us: "Without revolutionary intellectuals, the revolution will not be victorious." "Winning over all progressive intellectuals to the influence of our Party is a necessary and major policy." The proletarian cultural revolution in China was carried out with the enthusiastic support and active participation of millions and tens of millions of revolutionary intellectuals. The proletarian cultural revolution is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to organize a vast army of revolutionary intellectuals of the left, to complete the glorious and great task of the socialist revolution.

In dealing with the general issue of intellectuals, we have always strictly adhered to the policy boundaries. We are completely different from the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small group." We implement the proletarian revolutionary line. We follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, in the struggle, pay attention to distinguishing between anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists and those who support the Party and socialism but have also said some wrong words, done some wrong things, or written some bad articles and bad works; pay attention to distinguishing between bourgeois reactionary academic authorities and those who have general bourgeois academic ideas; pay attention to strictly distinguishing between the two types of different nature contradictions, and strive to prevent treating people's internal contradictions as enemy contradictions. Towards those intellectuals who have lived through the old society, we have always adopted the policy of unity, education, and transformation. Towards general bourgeois scholars, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist, not anti-communist and anti-people, we give them appropriate working conditions, letting them continuously transform their worldview in their work. Towards those who have made this or that mistake, as long as they correct their mistakes, the masses welcome them. The actor Du Jinfeng, who once performed the bad play "The Peony Pavilion," has corrected her mistakes and is willing to make a revolution with the masses, and the masses welcome her. She has now been elected as a leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the China Peking Opera House. The imperialists and modern revisionists slander our proletarian cultural revolution as "knocking down all intellectuals" and "putting the elite of the country's intellectuals in a state of water and fire," this is extremely shameless slander. What "elite"? The counter-revolutionary revisionist intellectuals and cultural spies like Xia Yan, Tian Han, Wu Han, and Deng Tuo are what they call "elite." They slander and defame on the issue of intellectuals, stripped of their disguise, is simply because these people have been knocked down, their hope of restoring capitalism in China has been dashed, and they are angry and desperate, coming out to cry for them!

"You have no freedom of speech, no democracy." This is another slander by the imperialists and modern revisionists against our proletarian cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "In the world, there is only concrete freedom, concrete democracy, there is no abstract freedom, abstract democracy. In a class struggle society, if there is the freedom of the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, then there is no freedom of the laboring people not to be exploited. If there is bourgeois democracy, then there is no proletarian and laboring people's democracy." What kind of freedom and democracy do the imperialists and modern revisionists advocate? Is it the freedom and democracy of the laboring people? Absolutely not, what they want is the freedom and democracy of the overthrown exploiting class to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Can such freedom and democracy be allowed to exist? No! Under the proletarian dictatorship in China, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and a small group of exposed counter-revolutionary revisionists, do not have their freedom and democracy. However, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers enjoy the most ample freedom and the broadest democracy. Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, the proletarian cultural revolution in China is a great democracy and great freedom under proletarian dictatorship. Unbiased foreign friends have seen, "The great ideological debate participated in by the entire nation is conducted in a democratic manner." Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses dare to express their opinions, dare to criticize, dare to debate, dare to post big-character posters. Ask, do any of the imperialists and modern revisionists have such democracy and freedom as the Chinese people? Does America have it? No. Does Britain have it? No. Does the Soviet revisionist have it? No. Not only do they not have it, but they use the methods of bourgeois dictatorship every day to brutally suppress the people, freedom and democracy in their countries have long become a historical mockery. Imperialists and modern revisionist masters, if you let the people have such freedom and democracy as we do, you would have been finished a long time ago!

The imperialists and modern revisionists slander our proletarian cultural revolution as "xenophobic." Ask: what "foreign" do we exclude? Towards the people of the world, we have always adopted a friendly attitude. People from various countries, despite their different thoughts and living habits from ours, as long as they come to China for friendly visits, we welcome them warmly. We strongly support the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world. Towards the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, we not only welcome them warmly but also want to fight side by side with them against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against the reactionaries of various countries. This, the Asian and African friends know particularly well.

However, if the "foreign" to be excluded refers to those imperialist, revisionist, and spy elements who harm the Chinese revolution, then, whether in the past, present, or future, we will exclude them all like cleaning up garbage. This kind of "xenophobia" is very good! Without this "xenophobia" action against imperialism and modern revisionism, imperialists and modern revisionists would bully us. Today, the great Chinese people have stood up, imperialists and modern revisionists will not be able to bully us again. Recently, British imperialism in Hong Kong orchestrated the "May 2," "May 6," and "May 22" incidents, unlawfully arresting our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, suppressing our revolutionary masses, and implementing fascist-style white terror. A few days ago, they also sent a few broken ships to the Hong Kong waters to bluff and intimidate people. The stupid and self-deluded John Bull has even forgotten the calendar, not knowing what era this is. We warn the British imperialists, the era of imperialist "pirate gunboat policy" has long passed. "The tiger of Guizhou is exhausted," your paper tiger's true form has been completely exposed. You might as well recall how your "Amethyst" warship was chased away with its tail between its legs! Today, in the face of a powerful socialist China, you still want to use a few broken ships to intimidate the great Chinese people, it is truly pathetic and laughable. We warn the British imperialists, you once took advantage of the corruption of the Qing Dynasty to launch the dirty Opium War, occupying Hong Kong, this old account has not yet been settled; today, you are again committing fascist atrocities in Hong Kong, this is a serious provocation to the great People's Republic of China, seven hundred million Chinese people will not tolerate it. British imperialist, if you do not confess your crimes, you will have to taste the iron fist of the Chinese people!

Comrades and friends: This "Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" discussion meeting held by the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau is a very successful and unprecedentedly grand discussion meeting. More than eighty writers and friends from thirty-four countries and regions on six continents gathered together to specially discuss Chairman Mao's brilliant work, symbolizing the great unity of the world's revolutionary people, symbolizing the new development of the Asian-African national liberation cause. The success of this meeting is a concrete manifestation of the world's people entering a completely new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, marking the entry of the Asian-African writers' movement into a new stage, and showing that Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line and literary theory are becoming a powerful ideological weapon for the people of various countries to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

China is a member country of the Asian-African region. Today, the people of Asia and Africa under the rule of imperialism and reactionaries are China's yesterday. The sufferings of oppression and exploitation that the Asian and African peoples have experienced, the Chinese people have all tasted. The Chinese people can best understand the revolutionary feelings of the Asian and African peoples, and the Chinese people are most concerned about the national liberation cause and the people's revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples. At present, the revolutionary situation in the Asian-African region is very good. The Asian-African region concentrates the sharpest contradictions in the contemporary world, is the weakest link in imperialist rule, and is also the center of the world revolutionary storm. American imperialism, in order to occupy this vast intermediate zone, while carrying out military aggression, is also carrying out large-scale cultural aggression. American imperialism repeatedly advocates that "ideas are as important as bread and guns," "every dollar spent on propaganda is equal to five dollars spent on defense." They loudly proclaim the so-called "ideological offensive," "winning the battle for hearts and minds." They mobilized an unprecedented scale of manpower and material resources, through news, film, radio, education, religion, and various means, from every corner of the ideological realm, to carry out comprehensive cultural aggression against the Asian and African peoples.

The Soviet revisionist clique is the accomplice of the imperialist aggressors. Under the pretext of "sympathy" and "aid," they actively carry out cultural infiltration in the Asian-African region, peddling traitor literature, advocating surrenderism, helping imperialism to suppress and sabotage the revolutionary movements of the Asian and African peoples. They are hypocrites with honeyed words and poisonous hearts.

Under this situation, the most important task facing the Asian-African writers is to use Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a powerful ideological weapon to fight against the cultural aggression of imperialism and the struggle against modern revisionism and the reactionaries of various countries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: towards the enemy, we must carry out a struggle of counterattack. The enemy's two-handed policy must be countered with a two-handed policy of revolution. The enemy has both military and cultural fronts, and the revolutionary people must also establish both military and cultural fronts. We must defeat imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, first of all, we must organize and strengthen the people's army, relying on the people's army that holds guns. The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize power by armed force, to solve problems by war. Without the people's army, there is nothing for the people. "Power grows out of the barrel of a gun," only with the gun, can power be seized and consolidated. However, having only this kind of army is not enough, a cultural army is also needed, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy. In the Asian-African region, this army is not only a powerful tool for seizing power but also a powerful tool for smashing imperialist cultural aggression.

A Japanese writer said: Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the highest level of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary literary theory, it is the sharpest weapon for us to fight against the bourgeois and revisionist literary line, it is the guiding principle for the action of all revolutionary literary and artistic workers. Some revolutionary writers in Japan have already taken action, breaking through various obstacles, going to the villages and factories to learn from the peasants and workers, creating revolutionary scripts. This is a very gratifying beginning. From here, we can see that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is not only the military program for the Chinese proletarian cultural army but also the military program for the Asian-African people to build a cultural army. It clearly points out the fundamental direction and combat tasks for Asian-African literary and artistic workers.

Comrades and friends! The Asian-African region is the birthplace of world culture. In the past hundred years, due to the aggression of imperialism, it has fallen behind. Now, the Asian and African peoples have awakened and are carrying out a magnificent revolutionary struggle. We believe that the brilliant and splendid new cultural era of the Asian and African peoples will definitely come in the flames of the national liberation and people's revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples! Let us march forward on the revolutionary literary line opened up by the great leader Chairman Mao!

Long live the great unity of the world's revolutionary people!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是在民族解放斗争的暴风雨中产生的。那时，中国正处在抗日战争最艰苦的时候；也是我们党反对王明的右倾机会主义、开展伟大整风运动的时候。在抗日战争开始以后，大批爱国的、革命的知识分子冲破了重重封锁，来到革命圣地延安。国民党反动派为了破坏人民的抗日战争，也派了一小撮特务、托派，混进了延安，同一小撮反党分子、叛徒勾结起来，配合日寇、蒋介石的军事进攻，在文化战线上掀起一股反动逆流。他们大肆宣扬资产阶级的文艺理论，鼓吹“太阳中也有黑点”、“文艺的任务从来就是暴露”等等谬论，煽动别人起来反党反人民。这样，在文艺工作者面前就摆着一个十分尖锐的问题：文艺是为民族解放和人民解放斗争服务呢？还是为破坏抗战、卖国投降的反动派服务？是为革命服务呢？还是为反革命服务？
    在这个时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在延安召开的文艺座谈会上，作了一个具有划时代的历史意义的《讲话》。毛主席的《讲话》根据马克思列宁主义的原理，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论，为在斗争中的无产阶级提出了一条最完整、最系统、最正确的无产阶级革命文艺路线。
    毛主席在这部光辉的著作中首先提出并解决了文艺与政治的关系问题。毛主席指出：无产阶级的文艺是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分。革命文艺队伍是一支为争取民族解放和人民解放的军队，是一支夺取政权的军队。毛主席说：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”无产阶级的文艺是“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器。”
    为了从根本上解决文艺与政治的关系问题，毛主席在《讲话》中指出：必须首先解决文艺工作者的立场问题。革命文艺工作者应该站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场，对于敌人必须暴露他们的残暴和欺骗，指出他们必然失败的命运。对于人民，则应该歌颂他们的劳动和斗争；对于他们的缺点和错误，不应该讥笑、敌视，而应该帮助他们同自己的缺点错误斗争，使他们团结、进步，坚定他们斗争胜利的信心。
    在解决立场问题的基础上，毛主席提出了文艺必须为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务这个根本方向问题。毛主席号召文艺工作者深入到工农兵群众中去，向工农兵群众学习，彻底地改造自己的世界观，把立足点“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来”。毛主席说：“知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”
  毛主席创造性地运用和发展了马克思主义的认识论，深刻地论述了文学艺术源与流的关系。毛主席指出：人民生活是文学艺术的唯一源泉，古代的和外国的文艺作品不是源而是流，对过去的文艺作品的继承和借鉴决不能代替自己的创造。有出息的文学家艺术家必须到工农兵群众中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，创造出真正的革命文艺作品来。
    毛主席为无产阶级的文艺批评指出了方向，提出了政治标准第一，艺术标准第二的原则。毛主席的《讲话》还无情地驳斥了“人性论”、“人类之爱”等等错误的反动的论调。
    毛主席这部光辉著作发表以后，革命文艺工作者在这条革命文艺路线的指引下，明确了战斗目标，找到了方向，肃清了王明右倾机会主义的影响，打退了一小撮反党分子、托派和叛徒的反党逆流；很多优秀的文艺工作者，按照毛主席的指示，用文艺这个武器，为抗日战争、解放战争服务，在民族解放和人民解放的烽火中，锻炼成为坚强的革命战士。
                         （二）
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是我们今天史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，《讲话》为我们的无产阶级文化大革命准备了全面的系统的理论、路线、方针和政策。
    无产阶级在夺取政权以后，被推翻了的剥削阶级并不甘心死亡。剥削阶级依仗着广泛的国际联系，依仗着自发资本主义的小生产力量，依仗着它在意识形态领域里占领的文化、艺术、哲学、法律等各种阵地，拚命地进行复辟活动。列宁说：“从资本主义过渡到共产主义是一整个历史时代。只要这个时代没有结束，剥削者就必然存着复辟希望，并把这种希望变为复辟行动。被推翻的剥削者不曾料到自己会被推翻，他们不相信这一点，不愿想到这一点，所以他们在遭到第一次严重失败以后，就以十倍的努力、疯狂的热情、百倍增长的仇恨来拚命斗争，想恢复他们被夺去的‘天堂’，保护他们从前过着甜蜜生活、现在却被‘平凡的贱民’弄得贫困破产（或者从事‘平凡的’劳动……）的家庭。”为了战胜阶级敌人的反革命复辟活动，无产阶级必须运用无产阶级专政去同敌人进行斗争。在无产阶级专政条件下进行的这场复辟和反复辟的斗争中，意识形态是一个先头阵地。革命的和反革命的力量首先在意识形态这个先头阵地上交锋。苏联和东欧一些国家在无产阶级夺取政权以后，没有很好地进行意识形态方面的革命运动，没有破坏剥削阶级的意识形态；相反，却让资本主义、修正主义思想大肆泛滥，破坏社会主义的经济基础，腐蚀无产阶级政权，结果走向今天的资本主义复辟。毛主席根据苏联和东欧一些国家的历史教训，总结了国际、国内的无产阶级专政的历史经验，亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命是在无产阶级专政条件下，发动亿万群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的无产阶级大民主方式进行的，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想发动群众自己解放自己的大革命。这次大革命是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的大决战。这次大革命的伟大历史功绩之一，就是揪出了盘踞在我们党中央要害部门最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺回了被他们篡夺的党、政、财、文大权，粉碎了他们的资本主义复辟阴谋。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命大大发展了马克思列宁主义，它向人们揭示了一个崭新的普遍真理：在社会主义社会，在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期，阶级斗争不是熄灭了，而是以复辟和反复辟斗争为主要内容继续深入地进行着；革命不是结束了，而是以新的形式进行着。在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的新时代，作为一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，不仅要承认阶级斗争，而且要承认无产阶级专政；要承认在无产阶级专政条件下，存在着复辟和反复辟的斗争。毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行文化大革命的理论，为国际共产主义运动指明了方向，是各国无产阶级反帝、反修斗争的指路明灯。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命受到了全世界革命人民的热烈欢呼。无产阶级革命派的同志们说：“现在已经取得了决定性胜利的无产阶级文化大革命，将成为世界上最伟大的具有划时代意义的事件而载入史册。在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东同志以少有的天才和预见性，解决了许多过去所没有解决的问题，从而大大地丰富了马克思列宁主义的巨大宝库。”这次会议上很多同志说得好：“中国无产阶级文化大革命打破了中国、苏联和其他国家的反革命修正主义分子的美梦。这使中国成为世界无产阶级革命更坚强的堡垒，成为被压迫民族和被压迫人民的更光荣的开路先锋。”
    震动世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命吓坏了美、英帝国主义和苏联修正主义老爷们，他们从不可阻挡的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中，看到了他们自己必然死亡的命运。他们拣起德国法西斯戈培尔的破烂武器，用造谣中伤的手段，对中国无产阶级文化大革命运动进行了种种诬蔑和攻击。
    在这场疯狂的叫骂声中，特别要指出的是苏联修正主义集团扮演了最可鄙的角色。他们用美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮那种最下流的语言攻击我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。他们指使一个臭名昭著的文化小丑大写黑诗，疯狂地谩骂毛主席。最近，苏修又召开了一个象征着现代修正主义腐朽文化走向死亡的文艺黑会，大肆攻击毛主席。被敌人反对不是坏事，而是一件天大的好事。他们恶毒地攻击毛主席，这就更加证明了当代的列宁——毛主席的伟大与正确。伟大的无产阶级革命的舵手毛主席，不仅为中国革命指出了方向和道路，而且在现代修正主义统治下的革命的人民也认为毛主席为他们指明了革命的方向和道路。现代修正主义者害怕在他们统治下的人民受了中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，掌握伟大的毛泽东思想的武器，起来造他们的反，赶他们下台。因此，他们就要想各种卑鄙的办法来污蔑和攻击毛主席。不是这样吗？那末，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，你们敢刊登毛主席的文章，刊登中国无产阶级文化大革命的社论和文件，不折不扣地将中国无产阶级文化大革命的真实情况告诉苏联人民吗？你们敢让苏联人民运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器来批判你们自己吗？你们不敢这样做，整天龟缩在阴暗的角落狂叫，算得什么“英雄”？
    毛主席的一首词说：“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”苏修对我们伟大领袖毛主席的这些攻击和谩骂，只不过是几只穷途末路的苍蝇最后发出的几声凄厉的抽泣而已，丝毫无损于伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。
    帝国主义、修正主义的老爷们胡说什么“你们摧毁传统文化”，“对世界的文化成就采取宗派主义的蔑视态度”等等，这纯粹是对我国无产阶级文化大革命的恶毒污蔑。
    我们对于古代的、外国的文化从来都是采取分析态度的。毛主席教导说：“我们必须继承一切优秀的文学艺术遗产，批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西，作为我们从此时此地的人民生活中的文学艺术原料创造作品时候的借鉴。有这个借鉴和没有这个借鉴是不同的，这里有文野之分，粗细之分，高低之分，快慢之分。所以我们决不可拒绝继承和借鉴古人和外国人，那怕是封建阶级和资产阶级的东西。但是继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的。”毛主席还指示我们：“必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”
    遵照毛主席的指示，我们一方面批判地继承传统文化中的革命的、进步的、优秀的部分，亦即吸取其精华；另一方面批判与铲除传统文化中的腐朽的、落后的、反动的东西，亦即剔除其糟粕。对于腐朽的、落后的、反动的封建主义文化和资本主义文化，亦即“传统文化”中的糟粕，我们的确要彻底摧毁，不摧毁它们，资本主义就要复辟，修正主义就要泛滥，无产阶级革命事业就要失败。不摧毁它们，新的无产阶级的革命文化就不能建立。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”“破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”但是如果认为，我们在摧毁腐朽的、落后的、反动的封建主义、资产阶级文化，摧毁帝国主义、现代修正主义文化的同时，也要把历史上一切优秀的文化遗产摧毁，那纯粹是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    批判地继承“传统文化”，就是毛主席所说的“古为今用”。事实证明，只有批判地继承，才能抛弃阻碍我们前进的东西，吸收其中对我们有用的东西，创造出崭新的人民文化来。中国古老的京剧不是已经处于衰朽没落的阶段了吗？但是中国无产阶级文化革命的闯将们，在江青同志的亲自领导下，使这个衰老的京剧获得了新的青春生命，创造了《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》等现代京剧的优秀样板。这些样板，不正是批判地继承了中国传统的艺术形式，做到“古为今用”了吗？这些样板作品的出现，一开始就受到广大工农兵群众的欢迎，与过去京剧演出的冷冷清清的局面相对照，不正说明帝国主义和现代修正主义者胡说的什么中国文化大革命要“摧毁传统文化”的无耻谰言彻底破产了吗？
    江青同志活学活用毛主席著作，在毛主席的革命文艺路线指导下，学一点，用一点，埋头苦干，使古老的艺术变为驱散旧式舞台黑暗统治的明珠；把统治舞台的帝王将相、才子佳人，老爷太太、少爷小姐，统统赶下台去，让工农兵的英雄形象大放光彩，把被颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来。这个事实充分证明，只有毛主席的革命文艺路线，才是一切优秀的传统文化的真正维护者！
    至于说到“对世界的文化成就采取宗派主义的蔑视态度”，那也不是我们。而是帝国主义和现代修正主义者。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是世界最高的文化成就，帝国主义者却禁止宣传，现代修正主义者则歪曲、篡改、阉割马克思列宁主义，还把伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林的著作封存起来，不让传播；不要说马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席了，就是古代的辩证法、唯物论，他们都不要了，这难道是尊重世界文化成就吗？帝国主义和现代修正主义者抛弃真正的世界人民的传统艺术，大肆推行腐朽的、反动的资本主义“艺术”，这难道是尊重世界文化成就吗？
    真正尊重世界文化成就的，恰恰是被帝国主义和现代修正主义者污蔑为“宗派主义”的中国。毛主席教导我们说：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料，……例如各资本主义国家启蒙时代的文化，凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收。但是一切外国的东西，如同我们对于食物一样，必须经过自己的口腔咀嚼和胃肠运动，送进唾液胃液肠液，把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，然后排泄其糟粕，吸收其精华，才能对我们的身体有益，决不能生吞活剥地毫无批判地吸收。”毛主席又说：“对于外国文化，排外主义的方针是错误的，应当尽量吸收进步的外国文化，以为发展中国新文化的借镜”。中国人民正是在毛主席的教导下，虚心地学习并且批判地吸收进步的外国文化的。又一批文化革命的战士，在江青同志领导下，把外国古老的芭蕾舞、交响音乐，经过改造，创作出光彩夺目的艺术珍品：芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》和交响音乐《沙家浜》，不就是有力的证明吗？铁一般的事实说明，所谓我们“对世界文化成就采取宗派主义的蔑视态度”，完全是诽谤！
    帝国主义、现代修正主义者们异口同声地攻击我们的无产阶级文化大革命“打倒一切知识分子”，这纯粹是污蔑。知识分子是分属于各个阶级的，有着不同的政治立场的。一种是接受了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，同工农兵结合的无产阶级知识分子，他们是无产阶级文化大革命的核心力量；在无产阶级专政条件下，我们就是要大力培养这种知识分子。另一种是世界观没有根本改造，或者没有很好改造，但是基本上是爱国的，拥护党、拥护社会主义的，上述两种是大多数；还有一种知识分子是卖国的、反动的、顽固地坚持走资本主义道路的反革命修正主义分子，这是极少数。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要打倒的，只是后面那一小撮反共、反人民的反动知识分子。对于他们绝对不能“施仁政”，因为他们是挖社会主义墙脚的“不拿枪的敌人”，是帝国主义和现代修正主义在社会主义中国的别动队。不把这些反党反社会主义的反动知识分子揭发出来，不对他们的反革命修正主义的言行进行彻底批判，不把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，将来就会出现象苏修领导集团那样的资本主义复辟，使我们社会主义事业遭到危害。
    我们党从来是重视革命知识分子的。毛主席经常教导我们：“没有革命知识分子，革命就不会胜利。”“争取一切进步的知识分子于我们党的影响之下，是一个必要的重大的政策。”中国无产阶级文化大革命，正是在千百万的革命知识分子热烈拥护和积极参加之下开展起来的。无产阶级文化大革命就是要用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去组织一支浩浩荡荡的革命知识分子的左派队伍，完成光荣伟大的社会主义革命任务。
    对于一般知识分子问题的处理，我们从来都是严格遵守政策界限的，我们同“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线截然不同，我们执行的是无产阶级革命路线。我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在斗争中注意把反党反社会主义的右派分子，同拥护党和社会主义，但也说过一些错话，做过一些错事或写过一些不好文章、不好作品的人，严格区别开来；注意把资产阶级的反动学阀、反动“权威”，同具有一般的资产阶级学术思想的人，严格区别开来；注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，极力防止把人民内部矛盾当作敌我矛盾处理。对于那些从旧社会生活过来的知识分子，我们从来是采取团结、教育、改造的方针的。对于一般资产阶级学者，只要他们不是反党反社会主义，不是反共反人民的，我们就给他们适当的工作条件，让他们在工作中不断改造自己的世界观。对于有过这样那样的缺点错误的人，只要他们改正错误，群众就欢迎他们，曾经演过坏戏《桃花扇》的演员杜近芳，她能改正错误，愿意同群众一起闹革命，群众就欢迎她，她现在已经被推选为中国京剧院革命委员会的领导成员。帝国主义和现代修正主义者诬蔑我们无产阶级文化大革命要“打倒一切知识分子”，“使国家知识界的精华处于水深火热之中”，这是极其无耻的诽谤。什么“精华”？夏衍、田汉、吴晗、邓拓之流的反革命修正主义分子、文化特务就是他们所说的“精华”。他们在知识分子问题上大肆造谣污蔑，拆穿了说，无非是因为这些人被打倒了，他们企图在中国复辟资本主义的希望破灭了，便恼羞成怒，气急败坏地出来为他们鸣冤叫屈而已！
      “你们没有言论自由，没有民主。”这是帝国主义者和现代修正主义者对我国无产阶级文化大革命的又一个诬蔑。
    毛主席说：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”帝国主义者和现代修正主义者鼓吹的自由民主是什么呢？难道是劳动人民的自由民主吗？绝对不是，他们所要的自由民主，是被推翻了的剥削阶级进行反革命复辟活动的自由民主。能允许这种自由民主存在吗？不能！在无产阶级专政下的中国，地富反坏和一小撮被揪出来的反革命修正主义分子，是没有他们的自由和民主的。但是，最广大的工农兵和革命群众却享有最充分的自由，最广泛的民主。在伟大统帅毛主席领导下的中国无产阶级文化大革命，就是在无产阶级专政下的大民主、大自由。不带偏见的外国朋友都看到了，“全国人民都参加的这场意识形态大辩论，是以民主方式进行的。”亿万革命群众敢于发表意见，敢于批评、敢于争论，敢于贴大字报。试问，帝国主义和现代修正主义者，你们哪一个国家，有象我们中国人民这样的民主，这样的自由？美国有吗？没有。英国有吗？没有。苏修有吗？也没有。非但没有，而且他们每天都在用资产阶级专政的手段，残酷地镇压人民，自由和民主在他们那里，早就成了历史的讽刺。帝国主义和现代修正主义老爷们，如果象我们这样让人民有这样的自由和民主，他们早就完蛋了！
    帝国主义、现代修正主义的老爷们污蔑我们的无产阶级文化大革命运动“排外”。请问：我们排的是什么外？我们对于世界人民从来是抱着友好态度的。各国人民，尽管他们的思想、生活习惯和我们不同，只要他们来中国作友好访问，我们都是热情欢迎的。我们对于全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放斗争，是大力支持的。对于无产阶级革命派的战友们，我们不但热诚欢迎，而且要同他们一起为反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、反对各国反动派而并肩战斗。这一点，亚非的朋友们是特别清楚的。
    但是如果排的“外”，是指那些危害中国革命事业的帝国主义分子、修正主义分子、特务分子，那么，不论在过去，现在，或在将来，我们都要象清除垃圾似的统统把他们排除掉。这种“排外”好得很！没有这种反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的“排外”行动，帝国主义者现代修正主义者就要欺侮我们。今天，伟大的中国人民站起来了，帝国主义和现代修正主义者休想再在中国横行霸道。最近，英帝国主义在香港一手制造了“五·二”“五·六”和“五·二二”血案事件，无理逮捕我港九爱国同胞，镇压我革命群众，实行法西斯式的白色恐怖，前几天又开来了几只破烂的军舰，在香港海面上装腔作势吓唬人，愚蠢的、不自量力的约翰牛，连皇历都忘掉了，竟然不知道现在是什么时代。我们正告英帝国主义者，帝国主义“海盗的炮舰政策”的时代，早已过时了。“黔驴技穷”，你们的纸老虎原形早已暴露无遗了，你们还是回想一下你们的“紫石英”号军舰是怎样狼狈的夹着尾巴逃跑的情景吧！今天，在强大的社会主义中国面前，你们还要妄想用几只破烂军舰来吓唬伟大的中国人民，真是可悲、可笑。我们要警告英帝国主义，你们过去利用清朝的腐败，发动了肮脏的鸦片战争，强占香港，这笔老账至今还没有清算；今天，你们又在香港施行法西斯暴行，这是对伟大的中华人民共和国的严重挑衅，七亿中国人民决不答应。英帝国主义分子，你们不低头认罪，就要请你们尝尝中国人民的铁拳滋味！（三）
    同志们，朋友们：这次亚非作家常设局举办的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会”，是一次十分成功的盛况空前的讨论会。来自世界六大洲三十四个国家和地区的八十多位作家和朋友，共聚一堂，专门讨论毛主席这部光辉著作，这象征着世界革命人民的大团结，象征着亚非民族解放事业的新发展。这次会议的成功，是全世界人民正进入一个完全崭新的以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代的具体表现，标志着亚非作家运动进入了一个新阶段，显示着毛主席的革命文艺路线和文艺理论，正在成为世界各国人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派的威力强大的思想武器。
    中国是亚非地区的成员国之一，在帝国主义和反动派统治下的亚非人民的今天，就是中国的昨天，亚非人民所受到的被压迫、被剥削的苦难，中国人民都尝够了。中国人民最能理解亚非人民的革命心情，中国人民最关心亚非人民的民族解放事业和人民革命事业。当前，亚非地区的革命形势一片大好，亚非地区集中了当代世界上的各种尖锐的矛盾，是帝国主义统治最薄弱的环节，也是世界革命风暴的中心地区。美帝国主义为了占领这个辽阔的中间地带，在进行军事侵略的同时，又大规模地进行文化侵略。美帝国主义一再鼓吹什么：“思想同面包和枪炮一样重要”，“用在宣传上的每一美元，可以等于用在国防上的五个美元。”他们大肆叫嚷所谓“意识形态的攻势”，“打赢争取人心的这一仗”。他们调动了空前规模的人力、物力，通过新闻、电影、广播、教育、宗教等各种手段，从意识形态的各个角落里，对亚非人民实行全面的文化侵略。
    苏联修正主义集团是帝国主义侵略者的帮凶。他们打着“同情”“援助”的幌子，积极在亚非地区进行文化渗透，推销叛徒文学，宣扬投降主义，帮助帝国主义镇压和破坏亚非人民的革命运动，他们是口蜜腹剑的伪君子。
    在这种形势下，摆在亚非作家面前的一个头等重要的任务，就是运用毛主席《讲话》这个威力无穷的思想武器，去同帝国主义的文化侵略作斗争，同现代修正主义和各国反动派作斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：对待敌人必须进行针锋相对的斗争。敌人的反革命两手政策，必须用革命的两手政策去进行反击。敌人有文武两个战线，革命人民也必须建立文武两个战线。我们要打败帝国主义和各国反动派，首先要组织和壮大人民的军队，依靠手里拿枪的人民军队。革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。没有人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。“枪杆子里面出政权”，只有有了枪杆子，才能夺取政权，巩固政权。但是，仅仅有了这种军队还不够，还需要有一支文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。这支军队在亚非地区来说，它既是夺取政权的强大工具之一，又是粉碎帝国主义文化侵略的强大工具之一。
    日本作家说：毛主席的《讲话》是马克思列宁主义水平最高的革命文艺理论，是我们同资产阶级和修正主义的文艺路线进行斗争的最尖锐的武器，是一切革命文艺工作者行动的指导方针。日本一些革命作家已经行动起来了，他们冲破了各种阻挠，到山村和厂矿里去，向农民和工人学习，创作革命的剧本，这是一个十分可喜的开端。从这里就可以看到毛主席的《讲话》不仅是中国无产阶级文化大军的建军纲领，同样也是亚非人民建立文化大军的建军纲领，它明确地为亚非文艺工作者指出了根本方向和战斗任务。
    同志们，朋友们！亚非地区是世界文化的发源地。近百年来，由于帝国主义的侵略，落后了。现在亚非人民已经觉醒，正在进行着轰轰烈烈的革命斗争。我们相信，亚非人民的先进的光辉灿烂的文化新时代，一定会在亚非人民民族解放和人民革命斗争的烽火中到来！让我们沿着伟大领袖毛主席开辟的革命文艺路线阔步前进吧！
    世界革命人民大团结万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
