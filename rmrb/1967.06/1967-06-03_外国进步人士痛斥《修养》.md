Foreign progressives enthusiastically hail the Chinese people's revolutionary actions in thoroughly criticizing the poisonous weed "Cultivation" under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, and in the struggle to expose and criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. They point out that the essence of "Cultivation" is to betray proletarian dictatorship and betray the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Japanese progressive writer Ema Shū says:

"Cultivation" propagates the "philosophy of survival"

Japanese renowned progressive writer Ema Shū recently spoke to a Chinese reporter, pointing out that the author of "Cultivation" had malicious intentions in publishing this book. "Cultivation" fully exposes its author, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party, as a consistent opponent of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, a personal careerist, and an unadulterated revisionist.

Ema also strongly condemns the author of "Cultivation" for advocating slavish obedience and the "philosophy of survival" that betrays the revolution. Ema points out that the "absolute obedience" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party in "Cultivation" is a demand for party members to unconditionally obey his revisionism. His talk about "in a reactionary ruling environment, it is necessary to give up some of the Party's work to preserve comrades," is in essence a search for "theoretical basis" and a defense for his "philosophy of survival" that betrays the revolution.

Ema emphasizes that the Chinese people's criticism and struggle against "Cultivation" will have a significant impact on the Japanese revolution and the world revolution.

Ema finally points out that "Cultivation" has spread widely in the international arena and must be criticized and its influence eliminated.

Myanmar progressive Dèqīn Duō says:

"Cultivation" denies proletarian dictatorship

Myanmar Asian-African Solidarity Committee member Dèqīn Duō recently met with Xinhua News Agency reporters in Rangoon and said: "The essence of 'Cultivation' is to deny proletarian dictatorship and betray the proletarian revolution. The author attempts to turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship."

He said, the editorials of "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily" have pointed out the way to eliminate the poison spread by this book in the revolutionary movements of various countries.

Dèqīn Duō said: "Resisting and eliminating the bourgeois reactionary views advocated by this book is the responsibility of the revolutionary people of various countries. This can prevent and eliminate the danger that this book's poison may cause to the revolutions of various countries. This danger may destroy the true revolutionary spirit and true class consciousness of revolutionaries in various countries."

Sri Lankan progressive teacher Jiā Nà Jī·Liǎ Nà Gé says:

Criticizing "Cultivation" is opposing revisionism

Sri Lankan progressive teacher Jiā Nà Jī·Liǎ Nà Gé said: The article "The essence of 'Cultivation' is to betray proletarian dictatorship" fully and clearly exposes the long-standing heresies spread by the poisonous weed "Cultivation."

She said, due to the exposure of this book, we can clearly see that the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party is attempting to restore capitalism in China and blatantly sabotage the revolutionary cause.

Jiā Nà Jī·Liǎ Nà Gé said, today is the era of invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Today, the decisive question for all revolutionaries is: do you support Mao Zedong Thought. It is clear that the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party does not approve of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the struggle to criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the struggle between the revolutionary line and the revisionist line.

Pakistani trade unionist says:

"Cultivation" betrays Marxism

A trade unionist from West Pakistan spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters, saying, the author of "Cultivation" has betrayed proletarian dictatorship, which is to betray Marxism, as Lenin pointed out in his famous work "The State and Revolution," this is the touchstone for truly understanding and acknowledging Marxism. This trade unionist said, Chairman Mao has taught communists in his many works how to engage in the living class struggle of the present day, to oppose imperialism and reactionaries, in order to seize and establish the power of the proletariat. However, the author of "Cultivation" does not mention the living class struggle of the present day when discussing how to be a good communist. He said, comparing Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" with "Cultivation," one can clearly see the hypocrisy, emptiness, and reactionary essence of "Cultivation."

### 外国进步人士痛斥《修养》

    外国进步人士痛斥《修养》
    外国进步人士热烈欢呼中国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中，对大毒草《修养》进行彻底批判的革命行动以及在揭露和批判中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中取得的伟大胜利。他们指出，《修养》的要害是背叛无产阶级专政，背叛无产阶级革命事业。
    日本进步作家江马修说
    《修养》宣扬的是“活命哲学”
    日本著名进步作家江马修最近对中国记者发表谈话指出，《修养》的作者抛出这本书，用心是极为恶毒的。《修养》这本书充分地暴露了它的作者，中国共产党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是一个一贯反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的个人野心家和不折不扣的修正主义分子。
    江马还强烈谴责《修养》的作者提倡盲目服从的奴隶主义和叛卖革命的“活命哲学”。江马指出，中国共产党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》中所宣扬的“绝对服从”，就是要求党员无条件地服从他的修正主义，而他所说的“在反动派统治的环境下，在必要时还要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”等鬼话，说穿了就是为他的叛卖革命的“活命哲学”寻找“理论根据”和进行辩护。
    江马强调指出，中国人民对《修养》的批判、斗争，对日本革命和世界革命将产生重大影响。
    江马最后指出，《修养》这本书在国际上流毒甚广，必须予以批判，并肃清它的影响。
              缅甸进步人士德钦兑说
            《修养》否认无产阶级专政
    缅甸亚非团结委员会委员德钦兑最近在仰光接见新华社记者时说：《修养》“这本书的要害是否认无产阶级专政，背叛无产阶级革命。作者企图把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政。”
    他说，《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部发表的文章，“指出了消除这本书在各国革命运动中散播的毒素的途径。”
    德钦兑说：“抵制和消除这本书所鼓吹的资产阶级反动观点，是各国革命人民的责任。这样做可以防止和消除这本书的毒素对各国革命造成的危险。这种危险可能摧毁各国革命者的真正的革命精神和真正的阶级觉悟。”
      锡兰进步教师里亚纳格说
      批判《修养》就是反对修正主义
    锡兰进步教师贾纳基·里亚纳格说：《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇文章，充分地和清楚地揭露了毒草《修养》长期以来散布的邪说。
    她说，由于揭露了《修养》这本书，我们可以清楚地看到中国共产党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，明目张胆地破坏革命事业。
    贾纳基·里亚纳格说，今天是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的时代。今天对全体革命者来说，决定性的问题是：你是否拥护毛泽东思想。很明显，中国共产党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派是不赞成马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。因此，批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，就是革命路线和修正主义路线两条路线之间的斗争。
               巴基斯坦工会工作者说
              《修养》背叛马克思主义
    西巴基斯坦的一位工会工作者对新华社记者发表谈话说，《修养》一书的作者背叛了无产阶级专政，也就是背叛了马克思主义，正如列宁在他的名著《国家与革命》中所指出的，这是测验是否真正了解和承认马克思主义的试金石。这位工会工作者说，毛泽东主席在他的许多著作中教导共产党员应如何投身于当代活生生的阶级斗争、反对帝国主义和反动派，以便夺取和建立无产阶级的政权。但是，《修养》一书的作者在谈论如何做一个好共产党员时，却根本不提当前活生生的阶级斗争。他说，拿毛泽东主席的“老三篇”同《修养》一书一比较，就可以清楚地看到《修养》一书的虚伪、空洞和反动实质。
