The commentary by the editorial staff of "Red Flag" magazine, "Certain Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles by the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province," is a document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It has important and universal significance and is worthy of study and learning by all units that have seized power, all revolutionary cadres, and all leaders of revolutionary mass organizations.

The proletarian revolutionary faction has seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This is a great victory, a great change. However, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads has not ended or eased but is developing in depth in new forms. We must not be the least bit complacent or careless but must engage in serious struggle.

The task before the revolutionary committees at all levels is to persist in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, correctly distinguishing and handling contradictions between the enemy and us and those among the people, winning over and uniting the majority of the masses and cadres, deeply criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the pernicious influence they have created, completing the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions and departments, and consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. To achieve this, we must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, overcome the "self" in our minds, and constantly guard against the infiltration of bourgeois thought.

In 1949, on the eve of national victory, Chairman Mao taught us: "Because of victory, sentiments of pride, of considering oneself a hero, of complacency, and of indulging in pleasure and shunning hardship may grow in the Party. Because of victory, the people will thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's armed force cannot conquer us; this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery, however, may conquer the weak-willed among our ranks. There may be some Communists who have never been conquered by armed enemies; they are truly heroes in the face of these enemies. But they may not be able to withstand the sugar-coated bullets of flattery; they may be defeated in the face of such bullets. We must prevent this situation." Chairman Mao also taught us: "We must make sure that our comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impetuosity, and that they continue to maintain the style of hard struggle."

This was the alarm sounded to the entire Party and army at that time; it can be said that it is also the alarm sounded to the proletarian revolutionary faction today, to the revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who have "emerged" in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who have now been exposed include some who were originally hidden troublemakers within the Party and some who became corrupt after national liberation. These people who have become corrupt are those who have gone against Chairman Mao's teachings. They are proud and self-satisfied, consider themselves heroes, do not seek progress, indulge in pleasure, and do not want to live a hard life. They enjoy the bourgeoisie's flattery and have been hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. The lessons of history must not be forgotten.

The revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who have "emerged" in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will also encounter the people's gratitude and some bourgeois flattery. In this situation, will they be steadfast proletarian revolutionaries or weak-willed individuals? This is a new and severe test.

If some people consider themselves heroes, think highly of themselves, enjoy being praised, and like being flattered, they will certainly become detached from the masses, unable to hear different opinions, let alone critical opinions, and will become deaf and blind. If this continues, they will confuse right and wrong, confuse enemies and friends, regard the masses' well-intentioned criticism as attacks, regard enemies as friends and confidants. In this way, they will turn into their own opposites.

We must clearly recognize that our transition from being oppressed to being in power is a major change. If we do not pay attention to transforming our thoughts, the small individualism in our minds will develop into big individualism. Lenin once pointed out: Small production constantly generates capitalism and the bourgeoisie. This principle applies to cadres and intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin who have not been transformed and who have many petty-bourgeois ideas in their minds. If they do not seriously transform their thoughts and accept supervision from the masses, there is a danger of becoming bourgeois elements after seizing power. "Preventing disasters before they happen," we must all be highly vigilant and put this question before ourselves every day, reflecting on our words and deeds, persisting in what is correct and in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and immediately correcting what is not correct and not in line with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province has seen this problem and proposed ten measures. These ten measures are very necessary. The regulations they have made are not trivial matters of daily life but major political principles, relating to the establishment of a proletarian, revolutionary leadership cadre, relating to whether we can implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and whether we can maintain our proletarian character.

The document of the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province is good because it has timely proposed measures to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois thought. This issue deserves the attention of revolutionary committees at all levels and the attention of revolutionary cadres and young revolutionaries who have "emerged" in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, study this issue, and based on our own situation and the situation of our unit, also make our own regulations and implement them resolutely.

    防止资产阶级思想侵蚀
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    本刊发表的《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的文件。它具有重要的普遍的意义，值得所有已经夺权的单位、所有革命领导干部和所有革命群众组织负责人研究和学习。
    无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权，这是一个伟大的胜利，伟大的变化。但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束，也没有缓和，而是在新形式下向纵深发展着。我们不能有丝毫的麻痹和轻率，而要作严肃的斗争。
    摆在各级革命委员会面前的问题是，坚持执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正确区别和处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，争取和团结群众和干部的大多数，深入批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其所造成的恶劣影响，完成本地区、本部门的斗批改，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。要做到这一点，必须树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，带头活学活用毛主席著作，克服头脑中的“私”字，时刻防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
    一九四九年，在全国胜利的前夕，毛主席教导我们说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”毛主席还教导我们：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    这是当时向全党全军敲起的警钟；可以说，也是向今天的无产阶级革命派，向在无产阶级文化大革命中“杀”出来的革命干部和革命群众组织的负责人，敲起的警钟。
    现在揭露出来的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，有些原来就是隐藏在党内的坏人，有些则是在全国解放以后变坏了。这些变坏了的人，就是违背毛主席的教导，他们骄傲自满，以功臣自居，不求进步，贪图享乐，不愿再过艰苦的生活，他们欣赏资产阶级的捧场，结果被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中了。覆车之辙，可为鉴戒，这些历史教训，千万不能忘记。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中“杀”出来的革命干部和革命群众组织的负责人，也遇到人民的感谢，也会遇到一些资产阶级的捧场。在这种情况下，是做一个坚强的无产阶级革命者，还是做一个“意志薄弱者”呢？这是一个新的严峻的考验。
    如果有些人以功臣自居，把自己看得了不起，喜欢人家对自己歌功颂德，欣赏人家的捧场，闹个人主义、风头主义，那就一定会脱离群众，听不得不同意见，更听不得批评意见，把自己变成聋子和瞎子。发展下去，就会颠倒是非，颠倒敌我，把群众对自己的善意批评当做攻击，当成仇敌，把别有用心的吹捧自己的人，当成朋友和心腹。这样，就要走向自己的反面。
    我们必须清醒地认识到，自己从被压制到当权，这是一个重大的变化。如果不注意改造思想，那么自己头脑中的小个人主义就会发展成大个人主义。列宁曾经指出：小生产每时每刻地产生资本主义和资产阶级。这个道理，对于小资产阶级出身而没有改造好的和脑子里有很多小资产阶级思想的干部和知识分子，也是适用的。不认真改造思想，不受群众监督，当权以后就有变成资产阶级分子的危险。“防患于未然”，我们都应该高度警惕，每天把这个问题摆在自己的面前，想一想自己的言论和行动，正确的符合毛泽东思想的就坚持，不正确的不符合毛泽东思想的就立即改正。
    山东省革命委员会看到了这个问题，提出了十条措施。这十条措施是十分必要的。它们所作的规定，绝不是生活小节，而是重大的政治性的原则问题，是关系到建立一个无产阶级的、革命化的领导班子的问题，关系到能不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，能不能保持无产阶级本色的问题。
    山东省革命委员会这个文件所以好，就在于它及时地提出了防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的措施。这个问题，值得各级革命委员会注意，值得在无产阶级文化大革命中“杀”出来的革命干部、革命小将注意。必须以毛泽东思想为指南，研究这个问题，根据自己的情况、本单位的情况，也作出自己的规定，并且坚决实行。
