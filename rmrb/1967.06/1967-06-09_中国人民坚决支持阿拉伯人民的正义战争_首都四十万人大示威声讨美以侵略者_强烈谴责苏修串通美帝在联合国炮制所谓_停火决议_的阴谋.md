The Chinese people resolutely support the Arab people's just war. Forty thousand people in the capital held a massive demonstration to condemn the American and Israeli aggressors. They strongly condemned the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists in fabricating the so-called "ceasefire resolution" at the United Nations.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 8, over forty thousand proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in the capital held a larger-scale demonstration and march today to support the Arab people's just struggle against American and Israeli aggression. The demonstrators emphasized that a just war is invincible. The heroic Arab people, united and persevering in their long-term struggle, will overcome all difficulties and carry on their just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel to the end, achieving final victory. The Chinese people will forever be the most loyal and reliable comrades-in-arms of the Arab people in their anti-aggression struggle.

Today, revolutionary workers, cadres, students, Red Guards, and revolutionary residents from the capital carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and banners and cartoons, pouring into the streets from all directions like a tidal wave. They gathered in front of the embassies of the United Arab Republic, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Algeria, Morocco, and the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing to hold demonstrations in support of the Arab people's just struggle. The massive demonstration was filled with thunderous slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Victory to the Arab people!" "Firmly support the Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle!" The revolutionary masses also delivered one letter after another of support and solidarity to the embassy staff. They also demonstrated in front of the British mission, shouting angrily: "U.S. imperialism is the enemy of all peoples of the world!" "U.S. imperialism, get out of the Arab region!"

The revolutionary masses in the capital who participated in the demonstration strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism in fabricating the so-called "ceasefire resolution" on the Middle East issue at the United Nations, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle. They emphasized that the flames of the Arab people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, will burn even more fiercely, and the plots of the Soviet revisionist leadership, which has always betrayed the revolutionary interests of the world's peoples, will inevitably meet with miserable failure.

In the thousands of letters of support and solidarity handed over to the embassies of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other Arab countries in China, the truth of Mao Zedong Thought was abundant, expressing the firm belief of the 700 million Chinese people to stand together with the Arab people in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. The Beijing Machinery Factory and many other factories and enterprises stated in their letters of support that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Although reactionaries may appear frightening, they actually have no real power. Now, the situation of the anti-imperialist struggle worldwide is excellent. U.S. imperialism has been surrounded by the peoples of the world. As long as we "resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," the heroic Arab people will ultimately emerge victorious. The revolutionary young people of the East Red Public Community of Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute praised the Arab people for giving the U.S.-Israeli aggressors a powerful blow, stating that it was a great boost to the morale of the Arab people and all peoples of the world, and a great blow to the prestige of imperialism. The revolutionary masses of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity expressed in their letter of support that the 700 million Chinese people vow to be the steadfast backbone of the Palestinian people and the one billion Arab people, forever fighting alongside the Arab people to bury U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

Angry revolutionary masses surged to the British mission, strongly protesting the aggression of U.S.-British imperialism against the Arab people and the persecution of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong by British imperialism. Posters, banners, and propaganda paintings filled the doors, walls, and ground of the British mission. Loudspeakers roared at the British mission's door: "Listen, British imperialists: you will not get away with colluding with U.S. imperialism to invade the Arab people!" Letter after letter of protest expressed the iron will of the 700 million Chinese people to resolutely support the Arab people and be the steadfast backbone of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. These protests warned British imperialism: you have not yet paid for the blood debt of your bloody suppression of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and now you are conspiring with U.S. imperialism in the Middle East to carry out this war of slaughtering the Arab people. We warn you: you must immediately get out of Arab territory! Immediately stop persecuting patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong! If you do not change your ways, you will be smashed to pieces against the iron wall of the peoples of the world. The revolutionary young people shouted slogans and sang "It's Right to Rebel" in Chinese and English at the British mission's door.

The Chinese workers at the British mission also participated in the demonstration and march, strongly protesting the British imperialists' aggression against the Arab people and persecution of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.

The propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought in the marching columns, with indignation in their hearts, performed their newly created street play "Down with U.S. imperialism, down with its lackey Israel." The Red Guards performed the street play "Firmly Support the Arab People's Just Struggle, Down with U.S. Imperialism" in front of the British mission's door, exposing the ugly faces of the aggressors in broad daylight and expressing their firm will to support the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle.

The revolutionary masses from various sectors in the capital held a grand demonstration and march, resolutely supporting the Arab people's just war.

    中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义战争
    首都四十万人大示威声讨美以侵略者
    强烈谴责苏修串通美帝在联合国炮制所谓“停火决议”的阴谋
    据新华社八日讯　首都四十多万无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众今天举行更大规模的示威游行，支持阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的正义斗争。示威的群众强调指出，正义的战争是不可战胜的。英雄的阿拉伯人民团结起来，坚持长期斗争，排除万难，一定会把反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的正义斗争进行到底，取得最后胜利。中国人民永远是阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的最忠实、最可靠的战友。
    今天，首都的革命工人、革命干部、革命师生、红卫兵小将和革命居民抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，举着标语牌和漫画，从四面八方象潮水一般涌到阿联、叙利亚、伊拉克、也门、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥等国家驻中国大使馆和巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处门前，举行声援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争的游行示威。浩浩荡荡的示威队伍里不断发出震天动地的口号：“美帝必败，阿拉伯人民必胜！”“坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反美斗争！”革命群众还把一封又一封的声援信、支持信递交给使馆人员。群众还到英国代办处门前举行示威，他们愤怒高呼：“美帝国主义是世界人民的公敌！”“美帝国主义从阿拉伯地区滚出去！”
    举行示威游行的首都无产阶级革命派和革命群众强烈谴责苏修领导集团同美帝国主义串通一气，在联合国炮制关于中东问题的所谓“停火决议”，妄图扑灭阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的熊熊烈火。他们强调指出，阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列的斗争烈火必将越烧越旺，一贯出卖世界人民革命利益的苏修领导集团所玩弄的阴谋，必将遭到悲惨的失败。
    在示威群众递交给阿联、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家驻华使馆的千千万万的声援书和支持信中，充满了毛泽东思想的真理，表达出七亿中国人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中誓和阿拉伯人民永远战斗在一起的坚强信念。北京市装具厂等许多工厂企业在声援信中指出，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。现在，全世界反帝斗争的形势好得很，美帝国主义已经陷入了全世界人民的重重包围之中，只要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，最后胜利一定属于英雄的阿拉伯人民。北京邮电学院东方红公社的革命小将在声援信中热烈赞扬阿拉伯人民给了美以侵略者强有力的迎头痛击，打得好，大长了阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义的威风。中国亚非团结委员会全体革命群众在支持信中表示，七亿中国人民誓作巴勒斯坦以及一亿阿拉伯人民的坚强后盾，永远和阿拉伯人民战斗在一起，共同埋葬美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列。
    愤怒的革命群众潮涌般地来到英国驻华代办处门前，最最强烈抗议美英帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的侵略，抗议英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞的迫害。一份份抗议大字报、标语和宣传画，贴满了英国代办处的大门、墙上、地上，广播喇叭对着英国代办处大门怒吼：英帝国主义者听着：你们伙同美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯人民，决没有好下场！一封封抗议信，表达了七亿中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民和誓作香港爱国同胞坚强后盾的钢铁意志。这些抗议警告英帝国主义：你们对我港九爱国同胞进行血腥镇压的血债还没有偿还，现在又勾结美帝国主义在中东策划了这场屠杀阿拉伯人民的战争，我们要警告你们：你们必须立即从阿拉伯领土上滚出去！立即停止对香港爱国同胞的迫害！如果你们再不悬崖勒马，必将在全世界人民的铜墙铁壁前碰得粉身碎骨。革命小将们对着英国代办处大门用中文英文高呼口号，高唱《造反有理》歌。
    在英国驻华代办处工作的中国职工，今天也参加示威游行，强烈抗议英帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的侵略和对香港爱国同胞的迫害。
    游行队伍中的毛泽东思想宣传队，怀着满腔怒火表演了他们新创作的活报剧《打倒美帝，打倒美帝走狗以色列》。红卫兵小将在英国代办处门前表演了《坚决支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争，打倒美帝国主义》的活报剧，把侵略者的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下，表达了他们坚决支持阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的坚强意志。
