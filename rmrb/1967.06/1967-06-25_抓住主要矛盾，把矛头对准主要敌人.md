In the great historical document, the "Notice" formulated under the personal direction of Chairman Mao, it is clearly pointed out: "Those who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles as representatives of the bourgeoisie are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." This clearly tells us that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle still centers on the issue of power. The proletariat must consolidate its power and carry the socialist revolution to the end, while the bourgeoisie seeks to usurp this power, restore capitalism, and turn China back into a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, the conspirators who are plotting a comeback. They are the sworn enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The great practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven how correct and great Chairman Mao's scientific judgment is!

Today, as we review the facts of the heart-pounding class struggles over the past year and study Chairman Mao's teachings, we understand even more clearly.

In the past, we did not recognize that the power already seized by the proletariat could be taken back by the bourgeoisie, or that the dictatorship of the proletariat could be turned into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. We often only recognized class struggles outside the Party, in society, in the government, and in grassroots organizations, but not within the Party's leadership organs. We did not see that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has clarified our confused ideas, raised our awareness, and made us deeply realize that after the proletariat seizes power, no matter how many things there are to do, we must not forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. The entire history of class struggle, past, present, and future, revolves around this crucial issue of power. Grasping the issue of power is grasping the crux of the matter. Forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat is forgetting the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism, and it means betrayal.

With power, we have everything. Actual struggles have made us understand this fundamental issue. We, together with the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians, have seized the power from the handful of power-holders within the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road and established the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ—the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The class struggle in socialist society is extremely complex. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have infiltrated the Party and government leadership organs. They wave the "red flag" and shout "revolution," but in reality, they are engaged in anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought evil deeds, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the weapon of class analysis to distinguish between friends and enemies and expose the true face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the contradiction between the revolutionary proletarians and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the main contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction, an enemy-versus-us contradiction; the contradictions between revolutionary masses and cadres who have made mistakes, between revolutionary factions and deceived masses, and within the leftist factions are contradictions among the people. Therefore, whether we can, in the midst of complex contradictions, concentrate our efforts on the main contradiction and always direct the spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, is a fundamental issue that determines whether we can achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the development process of complex things, there are many contradictions, among which there must be one principal contradiction, whose existence and development regulate or influence the existence and development of other contradictions." "Once we grasp this principal contradiction, everything becomes easy." Therefore, as long as we grasp the main contradiction, hold the correct direction of struggle, and direct the spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, then the contradictions between the revolutionary proletarians and cadres who have made mistakes, between revolutionary factions and deceived masses, and within the leftist factions will also be easier to resolve. On the contrary, if we deviate from the main contradiction and the direction of struggle, we will not be able to handle the contradictions among the people properly, and we will confuse the revolutionary ranks, objectively helping the class enemy.

During the deepening of the Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders within the original Provincial Party Committee, in order to protect themselves and divert the direction of struggle, like the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen, advocated that "everyone makes mistakes," "the Provincial Party Committee is a rotten unit, there are no good people in the office," and so on, deliberately confusing two kinds of contradictions of different natures, attempting to muddy the waters. To expose this conspiracy, we firmly grasped the direction of struggle, seriously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, and used the method of class analysis to affirm that the majority of the cadres in the office are good or relatively good. For those who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party and anti-socialist, we must strictly distinguish them from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "punishing the past to warn the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," uniting them to fight against the enemy. Let them go to the masses' struggle, stand out in the struggle, and in the struggle, draw a clear line with the power-holders taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line, making them truly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As a result, many cadres who made mistakes quickly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, turned the tables, and maximally isolated the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The contradiction between the revolutionary factions and the deceived masses is a contradiction among the people. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are scheming to stir up struggles among the masses. If we do not see this, we will fall into the enemy's trap, fight "internal wars" among the people, let the power-holders taking the capitalist road slip away, or "sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight," profiting from the chaos. We must persist in patiently persuading and educating the deceived masses, helping them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively uniting with them, and fighting shoulder to shoulder. Some, after being tested in struggle, have a firm stance and strong revolutionary spirit, and even request to join the leftist organizations, we also absorb them into the leftist ranks. As a result, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have no room to maneuver, and a strong fighting force that is united against the enemy was quickly formed.

In summary, only by focusing on the main contradiction and always directing the spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, can we develop and strengthen the leftist ranks, unite the broad masses and the broad cadres, achieve revolutionary great unity, and seize a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    抓住主要矛盾，把矛头对准主要敌人	黑龙江省原省委机关红色造反团　《看今朝》分团
    毛主席在他亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》这个伟大历史文件中，明确地指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”这就清楚地告诉我们，在无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，仍然集中到政权问题上。无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，把社会主义革命进行到底，资产阶级则要篡夺这个政权，实行资本主义复辟，让中国再倒退为半封建半殖民地国家。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就是混进党里的资产阶级代表人物，搞阴谋复辟的坏家伙。他们是无产阶级专政的死对头，是无产阶级专政下进行革命的主要对象。
    一年来，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践证明，毛主席的科学论断是何等英明、正确、伟大啊！
    今天，结合一年来一场场惊心动魄的阶级斗争的事实，再学习毛主席的英明教导，就更加亲切，认识得更清楚了。
    过去，我们对无产阶级已经取得的政权还可能被资产阶级夺过去，无产阶级专政还可能变为资产阶级专政是不认识的；对社会主义时期的阶级斗争，往往只认识国外的、社会上的、党外的、基层组织中的阶级斗争，不认识党政领导机关内的阶级斗争，看不到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是无产阶级专政最主要最危险的敌人。毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，澄清了我们的糊涂观念，提高了我们的认识，使我们深深体会到，在无产阶级夺取政权以后，无论有怎样千头万绪的事，也不要忘记无产阶级专政。全部的阶级斗争历史，无论过去、现在和将来，都是紧紧围绕着政权这个要害问题展开的。抓住了政权问题，就是抓住了要害。忘记了无产阶级专政，就是忘记了马克思列宁主义的根本，就意味着背叛。
    有了政权，就有了一切。实际斗争使我们认识了这个根本问题。我们和广大无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺了黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大权，建立起革命“三结合”的临时权力机构——黑龙江省革命委员会。这是毛主席无产阶级专政学说的伟大胜利。
    社会主义社会的阶级斗争是极其复杂的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派钻进党政领导机关内部，他们打着“红旗”，喊着“革命”，而实际干的是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当，妄图推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。因此，我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，运用阶级分析的武器，善于分清敌友，识破党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的真面目。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是主要矛盾，是对抗性矛盾，是敌我矛盾；革命群众同犯有错误的干部之间、革命派同受蒙蔽的群众之间、左派内部之间的矛盾，则是人民内部矛盾。因此，能否在纷纭复杂的矛盾斗争中，集中全力抓住主要矛盾，始终将斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这是关系到能否取得无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的根本问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。”“捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”因此，只要抓住了主要矛盾，掌握好斗争大方向，把矛头集中指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，那么，无产阶级革命派和犯有错误的干部、受蒙蔽的群众之间的矛盾，以及左派内部的矛盾，也就易于解决。相反，如果离开主要矛盾，离开斗争的大方向，就不能处理好属于人民内部的矛盾，就会搞乱革命阵线，在客观上帮助了阶级敌人。
    在文化大革命深入发展时，原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了保护自己，转移斗争大方向，和反革命修正主义分子彭真一样鼓吹“错误人人有份”，“省委是烂掉单位，机关里没有好人”，等等，故意混淆两种不同性质的矛盾，妄图把水搅浑。为了揭破这个阴谋，我们紧紧掌握了斗争大方向，认真学习和贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，用阶级分析的方法，肯定机关干部大多数是好的和比较好的。对犯有错误，但还不是反党、反社会主义的干部，必须同一小撮走资本主义道路当权派严格区别开来，按照毛主席指示的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，团结他们一致对敌。让他们到群众斗争中去，在斗争中亮相，在斗争中同走资本主义道路当权派、同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，使他们真正站到毛主席的革命路线上来。这样做的结果，很多犯错误的干部迅速站到毛主席的革命路线上来，杀了回马枪，最大限度地孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    革命派同受蒙蔽的群众之间的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，处心积虑要挑起群众之间的斗争，如果我们不看到这一点，就会上敌人的当，在人民内部打“内战”，让走资本主义道路当权派偷偷溜掉，或“坐山观虎斗”，从中渔利。我们对待受蒙蔽的群众，要坚持耐心说服教育，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，主动团结他们，并肩战斗。有的经过斗争考验，立场坚定，革命造反精神强了，并要求参加左派组织的，我们也吸收他们参加左派队伍。我们这样作的结果，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就没空子可钻，很快形成了一致对敌的强大的战斗队伍。
    总之，只有抓住主要矛盾，始终把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，才能发展和壮大左派队伍，团结广大群众和广大干部，实现革命的大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
