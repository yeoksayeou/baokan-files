The "Seminar to Commemorate the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Talk at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" held by the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers concluded its speeches today. Writers and friends from the six continents have, over the past few days, unanimously pointed out in their speeches: To make a revolution, to be a revolutionary of the proletariat, to develop revolutionary literature and art, to sum up in a thousand ways and ten thousand ways, the most fundamental thing is to strive to study, grasp, and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

Writers and friends from various countries have expressed in their speeches with revolutionary fervor that in this era where Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner of the world, revolutionary and progressive writers of all countries must take Mao Zedong Thought as their common program of struggle, take "The Talk" as their weapon, and make literature and art an integral part of the entire revolutionary machine. They must organize a vast revolutionary cultural army to stand together with the broad masses of workers and peasants who are oppressed and exploited around the world, to thoroughly defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and to overturn the history that has been distorted by the ruling classes for thousands of years on the political and literary stages of Asia, Africa, and the world, restoring history to its true face.

Over the past four days, writers and friends from various countries have repeatedly expressed their boundless love and respect for the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and their boundless faith and loyalty to the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. They have burst out in dozens of languages with a common voice of the world's revolutionary people: Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Long, long live him! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long, long live it!

Thai friend Paron Jularan was the first to speak at today's meeting. He enthusiastically praised the great significance of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Talk" and introduced the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people and Thai literary and art workers. He said that in 1958, the new puppet regime in Thailand, in order to maintain its shaky reactionary rule, implemented the most barbaric fascist dictatorship and used armed force to suppress the people. The people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, took up arms to defend themselves. From then on, the revolutionary armed forces of Thailand emerged, and the "sparks" of armed struggle quickly blazed up on the land of Thailand.

Paron Jularan said that with the development of the revolutionary situation, Thai revolutionary literary and art workers have adhered to the principles of Chairman Mao's "The Talk," gone among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and united with the armed people's army to wage a resolute struggle against American imperialism and the Thai reactionaries.

Paron Jularan finally expressed that the Thai people are determined to take Mao Zedong Thought as their guide for struggle. Thai literary and art workers are ready at any time to unite with the people and literary and art workers of the world, aiming their pens and guns at American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all their lackeys, until the Thai people and the people of the world achieve final victory.

Myanmar writer Ye Gon strongly stated in his speech that Myanmar revolutionary and progressive writers must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong and be revolutionaries for life. He said that on this day when we commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "The Talk," we more strongly realize that with Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we can take up our pens, raise our guns, and fight according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and we will be invincible. We must unite with the masses, learn from them, and sincerely serve them. By serving the people, we will be invincible.

He said, we are writers of the Mao Zedong era, we are warriors nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Every writer, if they love their own national culture and hope to raise their own national culture, must face east, face China, and face Chairman Mao.

He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shaken the world. It has made imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries tremble before the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

He angrily denounced the crimes of modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership in destroying Myanmar's armed revolutionary struggle and the world revolutionary cause. He said, despite the efforts of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk to sabotage, the revolutionary people of Myanmar have been tempered into steel. Our cause is just. We rely on our own strength and the sympathy of the progressive people of the world. We will surely achieve final victory.

Brazilian friend Martins spoke about the revolutionary literary movement initiated by Brazilian leftist intellectuals fifteen years ago and the painful lessons of being suppressed and crushed by American imperialism and the reactionaries. These lessons have made us understand Chairman Mao's teachings: In our struggle, there are various fronts, and among them, we can also say there are military and cultural fronts. To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army that holds guns.

Martins said that revolutionary writers and intellectuals of each country should first strive to establish a proletarian armed force, grasp the foundation and root of seizing all power, including power on the cultural front—the gun. The force leading this people's army should be a party based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

He said, without a revolutionary party, without a party established and led by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with a revolutionary style of Marxism-Leninism and the style of Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot achieve revolutionary victory. The most important task for revolutionary intellectuals of each country is to participate in the struggle to establish a truly revolutionary party that is loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, both in theory and action.

French friend Denis said that Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Talk" is a programmatic document of great significance. Denis hoped in his speech that "The Talk" would be published more widely to spread Mao Zedong Thought, so as to contribute to smashing the bourgeois reactionary line and ensuring the victory of the proletarian dictatorship.

Belgian friend Monique Belu said in her speech that Chairman Mao's "The Talk" has unprecedentedly, most clearly, most systematically, most thoroughly, and most comprehensively expounded on the problems of revolutionary literature and art, and is a brilliant development of the Marxist-Leninist worldview. The principles in "The Talk" are part of Chairman Mao's entire great revolutionary thought. Once this great revolutionary thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a material force to transform the world.

She said, Mao Zedong Thought has become the guiding ideology of 700 million Chinese people. Undoubtedly, the people of other countries in the world will also follow the Chinese people to grasp this great revolutionary thought.

British writer Smith strongly denounced in her speech the recent fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong, where they brutally suppressed, arrested, and massacred Chinese compatriots. She said, the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong show that they are afraid of the greatest Marxist of the contemporary era, afraid of the most brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, afraid of the spread of proletarian thought and the demise of bourgeois thought.

She said, under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, writers of various countries take action, oppose imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary thought, take up their pens, stand with the working class, and cleanse the muddy waters of bourgeois literature and art.

The General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Cha Hado, said in his speech that Chairman Mao is the great Lenin of the contemporary era. Chairman Mao has inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism, pushing Marxism-Leninism to a new and higher stage. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is not only extremely important for China, which takes Marxism-Leninism as its theoretical basis, but is also equally important for the world's revolutionary people who resolutely oppose imperialism.

Cha Hado strongly denounced the Soviet modern revisionists for betraying Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian revolution, colluding with imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and suppressing the world people's revolution. He said, to oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism. It is our sacred duty to continuously expose modern revisionism.

Cha Hado emphasized that revolutionary literary and art workers must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their work and struggle, stand firmly with the people, and wage a struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, striving for the victory of socialism in the world.

Their speeches at the meeting were warmly welcomed. Writers and friends from various countries repeatedly waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and paid revolutionary respect to them.

    革命作家要以毛泽东思想为共同纲领 
    各国作家和朋友在讨论会上满怀革命豪情畅谈学习《讲话》心得
    据新华社四日讯　由亚非作家常设局举行的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年讨论会”大会发言，今天已经结束。来自世界六大洲的作家和朋友几天来在发言中一致指出：要革命，要做一个无产阶级革命派，要发展革命的文艺，说千条，道万条，努力学习、掌握、运用毛泽东思想，是最最根本的一条。
    各国作家和朋友在发言中满怀革命豪情地表示，在世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代里，各国革命的进步的作家必须以毛泽东思想为共同的战斗纲领，以《讲话》为武器，把文艺做为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，组织一支浩浩荡荡的革命文化大军，同世界上被压迫、被剥削的广大工农群众在一起，彻底打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，把亚非和世界各国政治舞台和文艺舞台上几千年来被统治阶级颠倒了的历史再重新颠倒过来，恢复历史的本来面目。
    四天来，各国作家和朋友一再表达了他们对世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的无限热爱和无限崇敬，对光焰无际的毛泽东思想的无限信仰和无限忠诚。他们用几十种语言迸发出世界革命人民的一个共同的心声：世界人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！
    泰国朋友帕荣·朱拉暖在今天的会上首先发言。他热情地赞颂毛主席的《讲话》这部光辉著作的伟大意义，并介绍了泰国人民和泰国文艺工作者的革命斗争情况。他说，一九五八年泰国新的傀儡政权，为了维持其摇摇欲坠的反动统治，施行最野蛮的法西斯专政，用武装来镇压人民。人民就根据毛主席的教导，用武装进行自卫斗争。从此，泰国拿枪的革命军队就产生了，武装斗争的“星星之火”便迅速地在泰国的土地上燃烧起来。
    帕荣·朱拉暖说，随着革命形势的发展，泰国革命的文艺工作者坚持毛主席《讲话》的原则，到工农兵当中去，和拿枪的人民军队结合起来，同美帝国主义和泰国反动派展开坚决的斗争。
    帕荣·朱拉暖最后表示，泰国人民决心把毛泽东思想当作自己斗争的指南，泰国文艺工作者随时准备和全世界的人民和文艺工作者团结一致，把笔杆子和枪杆子指向美帝国主义、现代修正主义以及它们的一切走狗，直到泰国和全世界人民取得最后胜利。
    缅甸作家叶贡在发言中强烈表示，缅甸革命进步作家一定要遵照毛泽东主席的教导，要当一辈子的革命派。他说，在我们纪念毛主席的《讲话》发表二十五周年的日子里，我们更强烈地认识到，我们有毛泽东思想为武器，拿起笔，举起枪，按照毛主席的教导进行斗争，我们就无往而不胜。我们要同群众结合在一起，向他们学习，老老实实地为他们服务。为人民服务，我们就无坚不摧。
    他说，我们是毛泽东时代的作家，我们是毛泽东思想哺育下的战士。每一个作家，如果热爱自己民族的文化，并希望提高自己民族的文化，那就必须面向东方，面向中国，面向毛泽东主席。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，震动了全世界，它使帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，在当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想面前发抖不止。
    他愤怒谴责以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义破坏缅甸武装革命斗争，破坏世界革命事业的罪行。他说，尽管勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流竭力进行破坏，但是缅甸革命人民已锻炼得钢铁一般坚强。我们的事业是正义的，我们靠自己的力量，靠世界进步人民的同情，我们一定会取得最后胜利。
    巴西朋友马尔丁斯在发言中谈到十五年前巴西左翼知识分子所掀起的革命文艺运动，以及以后受到美帝国主义和反动派镇压被扑灭的沉痛教训。这些教训使我们体会到毛主席的教导：在我们的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线。我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。
    马尔丁斯说，每一个国家的革命文艺家、革命知识分子，应该首先致力于建立一支无产阶级武装部队，掌握夺取一切权力，也包括文化战线的权力的基础和根本——枪杆子。而领导这支人民军队的力量应该是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为理论基础的政党。
    他说，如果没有一个革命的政党，没有一个按马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想建立起来，用马克思列宁主义革命风格，用毛泽东思想的风格建立起来的政党，就不能取得革命的胜利。每一个国家的革命知识分子头等重要的任务，就是要从理论和行动上参加建立一个真正革命的、忠于毛泽东思想的党的斗争。
    法国朋友戴尼斯说，毛主席的光辉著作《讲话》是具有极为广泛意义的纲领性文件，是无产阶级文化革命的纲领。戴尼斯在发言中希望更多地出版《讲话》，广泛传播毛泽东思想，以便为砸烂资产阶级反动路线和保证无产阶级专政的胜利作出贡献。
    比利时朋友莫妮克·贝湖在发言中说，毛主席的《讲话》空前地、最清楚、最系统、最透彻和最全面地阐述了革命文艺的问题，是对马克思列宁主义世界观的天才发展。《讲话》中的原则是毛主席整个伟大革命思想的一部分。这种伟大的革命思想一旦掌握了群众，就会变成改造世界的物质力量。
    她说，毛泽东思想已成为七亿中国人民的指导思想。毫无疑问，世界上其他国家的人民，也将跟着中国人民掌握这一伟大的革命思想。
    英国作家史密斯在发言中强烈谴责香港英国当局最近在香港血腥镇压、逮捕、屠杀中国同胞的法西斯暴行。她说，香港英国当局的暴行说明，他们害怕当代最伟大的马克思主义者，害怕最光辉的毛泽东思想，害怕无产阶级思想的传播和资产阶级思想灭亡。
    她说，在光辉的毛泽东思想的指引下，各国作家行动起来，反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动的思想，拿起笔杆，同工人阶级站在一起，荡涤资产阶级文学艺术的污泥浊水。
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多在发言中说，毛主席是当代伟大的列宁。毛主席继承和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义推进到一个崭新的、更高的阶段。毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅对于以马克思列宁主义作为理论基础的中国是异常重要的，而且对于坚决反对帝国主义的世界革命人民也是同等重要的。
    查禾多强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者背叛马克思列宁主义和无产阶级革命，同帝国主义和各国反动派同流合污，相互勾结，反对和镇压世界人民革命。他说，反帝必须反修。不断揭露现代修正主义，是我们的神圣责任。
    查禾多强调指出，革命的文艺工作者要用毛泽东思想来指导自己的工作和斗争，坚定地同人民站在一起，进行反帝、反修和反对各国反动派的斗争，争取社会主义在全世界的胜利。
    他们在大会上的发言都受到了热烈的欢迎。各国作家和朋友不断挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向他们致以革命的敬意。
