Title: This Counterattack is Well Done

A small clique of revisionists within the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) has been pursuing a revisionist line that is anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-Chinese. This has sparked growing dissatisfaction and opposition from the broad masses of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in Japan. Some grassroots organizations within the JCP, armed with Marxist-Leninist thought and Mao Zedong Thought, have raised the banner of revolution and are actively counterattacking these revisionists. This counterattack is well done and justified.

The revisionists within the JCP have strayed further and further from the path of Marxism-Leninism. They use the fallacy of "class cooperation" to emasculate the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, are infatuated with bourgeois parliamentary politics, and pursue a policy of class capitulation, seeking only to eke out a living under the capitalist system. They replace internationalism with chauvinism, actively follow the Soviet revisionists in their frenzied anti-China campaign, and maliciously damage the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, acting as accomplices to the Sato government in its hostility towards China. They have completely abandoned the revolutionary cause of the Japanese proletariat and the Japanese people, degenerating into servants of the Japanese reactionaries.

The degeneration of the JCP revisionists is not accidental. In this new era, where imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory, the counter-revolutionary forces, consisting of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries, are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the revolutionary forces, which include Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people from all over the world. All political forces must take a stand in this struggle, either aligning with the revolutionary forces or the counter-revolutionary forces. The JCP revisionists, on the one hand, yield to the pressure from American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, and domestic reactionaries, and are cowed by their counter-revolutionary arrogance; on the other hand, they are swayed and corrupted by the bourgeoisie, becoming a bunch of bourgeoisified labor aristocrats detached from the broad masses of laborers. Fearful of revolution and unwilling to make one, they inevitably take the path of opposing revolution, becoming traitors to the Japanese proletariat.

Wherever there is the dark rule of imperialism and reactionaries, the people will rise up in revolution. If communists deviate from the people's revolutionary demands, they will inevitably be spurned by the people. Wherever there are revisionists, there will be Marxist-Leninists standing up to oppose them. This is the dialectic of history. The situation in Japan is no exception.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "Opportunists who try to block the tide may be found almost everywhere, but the tide is unblockable. Socialism is advancing to victory everywhere, leaving all obstacles behind. This is how society progresses every day, and people's thoughts are being transformed, especially during times of revolutionary upsurge."

The small clique of JCP revisionists not only do not make revolution themselves but also do not allow others to do so. They even impose fascist rule within the party, going so far as to collude with Japanese reactionaries to suppress and frame true revolutionaries. Their reckless actions can only hasten their own downfall.

The true Marxist-Leninists and proletarian revolutionaries in Japan are fearless in the face of violence, undaunted by difficulties, steadfast in truth, and daring to rebel, displaying the great spirit of the revolutionary camp. They are the hope of the Japanese people and the future of Japan. The Marxist-Leninist forces in Japan will rely on the proletariat and the broad masses of the people to grow and strengthen in the arduous, complex, and tortuous struggle. Those revisionists will surely be thrown into the dustbin of history.

    这个反造得好
    日共的一小撮修正主义分子，推行反马克思列宁主义、反革命、反人民、反中国的修正主义路线，激起了日本广大的马克思列宁主义者和革命群众日益强烈的不满和反对。日共的一些基层组织，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，高举革命的旗帜，纷纷起来大造这些修正主义分子的反。这个反造得好，造得有理。
    日共的修正主义分子，沿着背叛马克思列宁主义的道路越走越远。他们用“阶级合作”的谬论来阉割无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，醉心于资产阶级的议会政治，奉行阶级投降的政策，只图在资本主义制度下苟且偷安。他们用民族沙文主义代替国际主义，积极追随苏修集团猖狂反华，肆意破坏中日人民的友谊，充当佐藤政府敌视中国的帮凶。他们已经把日本无产阶级和日本人民的革命事业抛到九霄云外，完全堕落成为日本反动派的仆从。
    日共修正主义分子的堕落，绝不是偶然的。在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的新时代，以帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派为一方的反革命势力，同以全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民为一方的革命力量之间，正在进行着一场你死我活的大决战。一切政治力量都要在这场决战中“亮相”，不是站在革命力量的一边，就是站在反革命势力的一边。日共的修正主义分子，一方面屈服于美帝国主义、苏修领导集团和国内反动派的压力，被它们的反革命气焰吓破了胆；另一方面受到资产阶级的拉拢和腐蚀，成了一伙脱离广大劳动人民的资产阶级化了的工人贵族。他们害怕革命和不想革命，就必然要走到反对革命的道路上去，成为日本无产阶级的叛徒。
    哪里有帝国主义和反动派的黑暗统治，哪里的人民总是要起来革命的。如果共产党人脱离了人民的革命要求，他们就势必要为人民所唾弃。哪里有修正主义者，哪里就必定有马克思列宁主义者站出来同他们对抗。这是历史的辩证法。日本的情况当然也不可能例外。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。社会就是这样地每天在前进，人们的思想在被改造着，特别在革命高涨的时候是这样。”
    日共的一小撮修正主义分子不仅自己不革命，而且不许别人革命。他们竟然在党内实行法西斯统治，甚至不惜勾结日本反动派，来打击和陷害真正的革命者。他们的这种倒行逆施，只能加速自己的垮台。
    日本真正的马克思列宁主义者，真正的无产阶级革命战士，不畏强暴，不怕困难，坚持真理，敢于造反，表现出了革命派的伟大气概。他们是日本人民的希望，是日本的未来。日本的马克思列宁主义的力量，必将依靠无产阶级和广大人民群众，在艰苦、复杂和曲折的斗争中成长和壮大起来。而那些修正主义分子一定会被丢进历史的垃圾堆。
