Title: The Black Declaration of the Soviet Revisionists' Persistent Betrayal Policy

A few days ago, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in the name of the Central Committee of the CPSU, issued a so-called "Resolution on the Policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel's Aggression in the Near East."

This is a pathetic attempt to cover up the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist clique; it is a clumsy new trick to deceive the Soviet people, the Arab people, and the people of the whole world; it is a counter-revolutionary manifesto to continue the policy of betrayal and to fiercely oppose China; it is also a gift from the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin to John­son's doorstep to pay homage.

As soon as the guns of the Middle East war started firing, the Soviet revisionist clique showed its true colors. This incident, more than the Caribbean crisis, the Moscow Three-Power Treaty, and the Vietnam War, has more concentratedly and nakedly exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique. If some people still did not see clearly what the Soviet revisionist clique is, then this time they should see more clearly. The Arab people and the people of the whole world are all condemning the Soviet revisionists' betrayal.

The small clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, whether at home or abroad, is in an even more difficult situation. To get out of their predicament and maintain their reactionary small court, they have racked their brains and exerted all their efforts, playing all sorts of tricks. The Soviet revisionist leaders, some running to the United States, some to Cairo, some staying at home to hold secret meetings. From concocting the "Seven-Nation Declaration" to holding this Central Committee plenum, they have spared no effort, busy as bees. The so-called "Resolution" of the Central Committee of the CPSU that has now been issued is nothing but a piece of plaster they have put on their tattered revisionist black flag.

This "Resolution" begins by saying that the plenum "fully endorses" the "political line and practical actions" of the Soviet revisionist clique in this Middle East incident. It is said that their line and actions are to support the Arab countries that have been attacked. This is a laughable attempt to deceive oneself. Just because you approve your own line, can you wipe out your treacherous deeds with a stroke of the pen?

What kind of "political line" did you actually follow in this Middle East incident? What kind of "practical actions" did you actually take? The facts are clear and everyone can see. The line you followed was one of colluding with American imperialism and betraying the Arab people; it was a line of supporting imperialist wars of aggression and opposing the Arab people's anti-aggression wars; it was a line of acting as a henchman of American imperialism and suppressing the Arab national liberation movement.

The soul of your line is the joint control of the world by the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the time of Khrushchev's betrayal, you have been following this line. Now you want to collude with American imperialism, but you are also afraid of exposing your counter-revolutionary face too much, so you always cover up and equivocate. Although this "Resolution" has to mention the United States, it does not dare to use the term "American imperialism," let alone condemn and expose American imperialism's crimes of launching this war of aggression. This clearly shows that you are still adhering to this thoroughly counter-revolutionary line.

In this "Resolution," the Soviet revisionist clique has smeared a thick layer of makeup on its face, boasting that they are "on the same side" as the Arab people, even claiming that their "prompt" and "decisive" actions have played an "important role" in stopping military actions in the Near East. This is a complete reversal of black and white, shameless to the extreme.

In the struggle between the Arab people and imperialism led by the United States, the Soviet revisionists have never been on the side of the Arab people, but on the side of imperialism. You are playing the role of a speculator, completely looking at the market to do business. You can talk about "supporting" the Arab people and "assisting" Arab countries with some things to gain political capital, but when it comes to the critical moment of struggle, you immediately betray and sell out the Arab people, colluding with American imperialism to jointly strike and suppress the Arab people.

You have long since been traitors to revolutionary wars, not distinguishing between just and unjust wars. The "stopping of military actions in the Near East" you talk about is actually standing on the same side as the imperialist aggressors, not allowing the Arab people to take up arms to fight back against the imperialist armed attacks. In this "Resolution," you openly shout about continuing to "extinguish the fires of war in the Near East," which means continuing to join American imperialism in extinguishing the flames of the Arab people's armed struggle against aggression.

If we talk about playing a role, then you are playing an "important role" as an international police force, you are playing an "important role" in the ranks of traitors and scabs, you are playing an "important role" as counter-revolutionary executioners.

In this "Resolution," the Soviet revisionist clique also repeats the hackneyed phrase of "joint action" like a litany. What your "joint action" is, the people of the whole world have long experienced. And this Middle East incident is a specimen of your "joint action" with American imperialism.

You collude with American imperialism, and in the United Nations, you jointly concocted one "ceasefire resolution" after another to sell out the Arab people. Then you actively responded to Johnson's call to expand the "areas of joint action" between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kosygin went to the United States to have secret talks with Johnson in Glassboro, showing a servile and humiliating attitude, which is not a big performance of your so-called "joint action"?

The Soviet revisionist clique is now vigorously advocating "joint action," which, apart from being used to boost the morale of their big and small lackeys and stabilize their own position, is only to drag others onto their counter-revolutionary track, to become traitors to the world's revolutionary people, henchmen of American imperialism, and executioners of the revolution. Such "joint action," Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people will never do.

The Soviet revisionist clique in this "Resolution" madly attacks China, attacks our great leader Chairman Mao, which only further exposes the counter-revolutionary face of this small clique of traitors.

The Soviet revisionist clique, whenever its evil deeds of betraying the world's revolutionary movement are exposed, will go into a hysterical frenzy and fiercely oppose China. This has become a rule. Traitors are servile and cowardly before the enemies of the people, but they are full of hatred and ferocious towards the revolutionary people.

The great Lenin once pointed out, "Marx is honored by these scoundrels precisely because he openly denounced them as traitors." The fact that the Chinese people are hated by the Soviet revisionist traitors is our glory. Revolutionary people are irreconcilable with traitors.

Why does the Soviet revisionist clique make such a big fuss about opposing China in the Middle East incident? It is because the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand with the Arab people, firmly support the Arab people's anti-aggression war, and firmly expose the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique, hitting their sore spot. So, you jump up.

What is called a "slander campaign." Can you deny the facts we have exposed? You have boils on your head and pus on your feet, and you still don't allow people to speak. Since you have done counter-revolutionary treacherous deeds, all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in the world will definitely thoroughly expose you, grab you and not let go, make you stink, and bring you down. This is also an unavoidable responsibility for every true revolutionary.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Reactionary elements who appear in disguise give people a false appearance while hiding their true nature. But since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot completely hide their true nature." The Soviet revisionist clique is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary clique. In the Middle East incident, they showed their true colors, and now they are trying every means to hide their true nature. However, no matter how they disguise themselves, no matter what false appearances they create, no matter how many tricks they play, they cannot cover up their counter-revolutionary true face or save themselves from their doomed fate.

All the revolutionary people of the world, including the Soviet people, must carry out a thorough cleanup of this group of despicable traitors and scabs and throw them into the garbage heap of history!

    苏修坚持叛卖政策的黑宣言	观察家
    几天以前，苏修领导集团以苏共中央全会的名义，抛出了一个所谓“关于苏联对以色列在近东侵略的政策的决议”。
    这是拣来掩盖苏修集团叛卖行径的一块可怜的遮羞布；这是蓄意欺骗苏联人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的一个拙劣的新花招；这是继续推行叛卖政策和猖狂反华的一篇反革命宣言书；这也是苏修头目柯西金送上门去朝拜叩见约翰逊的一份见面礼。
    中东战争的炮声一响，苏修集团就显了原形。这一次事件，比加勒比海危机，比莫斯科三国条约，比越南战争，都更集中地赤裸裸地暴露了苏修集团的叛徒面目。如果说，过去有些人还看不大清楚苏修集团是个什么东西，那么这一次，就看得比较清楚了。阿拉伯人民和全世界人民，都在痛斥苏修的叛卖。
    以勃列日涅夫和柯西金为首的这一小撮叛徒，无论在国内在国外，都更加不好混了。他们为了摆脱自己的困境，维持自己的反动小朝廷，绞尽了脑汁，使尽了力气，搞了许多鬼名堂。苏修头目们，有的奔美国，有的跑开罗，有的守在家里开黑会。他们从炮制“七国声明”，一直到这次召开中央全会，可算是全力以赴，忙得不亦乐乎。现在抛出来的所谓苏共中央全会的“决议”，也不过是他们往自己破烂不堪的修正主义黑旗上糊窟窿的一张狗皮膏药而已。
    这个“决议”，一上来就说什么全会“完全赞同”苏修集团在这一次中东事件中所执行的“政治路线和实际活动”。据说，他们的路线和活动，是支持遭到进攻的阿拉伯国家的。掩耳盗铃，实在滑稽可笑。你们自己批准了自己的路线，难道就能把你们的叛卖行径一笔勾销了吗？
    你们在这次中东事件中执行的究竟是什么样的“政治路线”，你们所干的究竟是什么样的“实际活动”？事实俱在，人所共见。你们执行的，就是勾结美帝国主义，出卖阿拉伯人民的路线；就是支持帝国主义侵略战争，反对阿拉伯人民反侵略战争的路线；就是充当美帝帮凶，镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动的路线。
    美苏合作主宰世界，这是你们的路线的灵魂。从赫鲁晓夫叛变的时候起，你们执行的就是这样一条路线。现在你们既要勾结美帝国主义，又怕自己的反革命面目太暴露，因此老是遮遮掩掩，闪烁其词。尽管这个“决议”不得不提一下美国，但是连美帝国主义这个字都不敢用，更不敢谴责和揭露美帝国主义发动这次侵略战争的罪行。这就清楚地表明，你们坚持的，仍然是这一条彻头彻尾的反革命路线。
    苏修集团在这个“决议”中，拚命地往自己脸上涂了一层厚厚的脂粉，胡吹什么他们同阿拉伯人民“站在一边”，甚至宣扬他们采取的“迅速”“果断”的行动，“在停止近东军事行动方面起了重要作用”。真是颠倒黑白，厚颜无耻到了极点。
    在阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争中，苏修从来就不是站在阿拉伯人民一边，而是站在帝国主义一边的。你们搞的是假支持、真出卖的那一套，活象一个唯利是图的投机商人，完全看行情做买卖。你们平时尽可以讲一些“支持”阿拉伯人民的好听的话，“援助”阿拉伯国家一些东西，捞点政治资本，可是一到斗争紧要关头，你们马上背叛和出卖阿拉伯人民，同美帝国主义勾结在一起，共同打击和镇压阿拉伯人民。
    你们历来不分正义战争和非正义战争，早就做了革命战争的叛徒。你们所说的“停止近东军事行动”，实际上就是和帝国主义侵略者站在同一个立场上，在帝国主义的武装进攻面前，不许阿拉伯人民拿起武器进行反侵略战争。你们在这个“决议”中公开叫嚷要继续“熄灭近东的战争火源”，也就是要继续伙同美帝国主义扑灭阿拉伯人民反侵略武装斗争的火焰。
    如果说到起什么作用的话，那末，你们是在起国际宪兵的“重要作用”，你们是在叛徒和工贼的行列中起“重要作用”，你们是在起反革命刽子手的“重要作用”。
    苏修集团在这个“决议”中，还象念经一样地重复所谓“联合行动”的滥调。你们的“联合行动”是怎么一回事，全世界人民早已领教过了。而这次中东事件，更是你们同美帝搞“联合行动”的一个标本。
    你们勾结美帝国主义，在联合国共同炮制了一个又一个出卖阿拉伯人民的“停火决议”之后，又积极响应约翰逊的所谓扩大美苏“共同行动领域”的呼吁。柯西金到美国去同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗进行密谈，奴颜婢膝，丑态百出，不就是你们所谓“联合行动”的一次大表演吗？
    苏修集团现在大肆鼓吹“联合行动”，除了用来给他们的大小娄罗打气，稳定自己的阵脚之外，无非是要把别人拉上他们那条反革命轨道，变成世界革命人民的叛徒，美帝国主义的帮凶，镇压革命的刽子手。这样的“联合行动”，马克思列宁主义者和革命人民是绝对不干的。
    苏修集团在这个“决议”中疯狂地攻击中国，攻击我们的伟大领袖毛主席，这只能更加暴露这一小撮叛徒丧心病狂的反革命嘴脸。
    苏修集团每当它叛卖世界人民革命运动的罪恶勾当被揭露的时候，就要歇斯底里大发作，疯狂反华。这已经成了一个规律。叛徒在人民的敌人面前是卑躬屈膝，奴相十足，而对于革命的人民则是满怀仇恨，凶恶得很。
    伟大的列宁曾经指出，“马克思所以光荣地被这班混蛋们痛恨，就是因为他公开地指责他们是叛徒。”中国人民遭到苏修叛徒的痛恨，正是我们的光荣。革命的人民是同叛徒势不两立的。
    苏修集团为什么在中东事件上大做反华文章呢？就是因为以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，坚决同阿拉伯人民站在一起，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争，坚决揭露苏修集团出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒面目，打中了苏修集团的要害。于是，你们就暴跳起来了。
    什么叫“诽谤运动”。你们否认得了我们所揭露的事实吗？你们自己头顶上长疮，脚底流脓，还能不许人家说话。既然你们干了反革命的叛卖勾当，全世界的马列主义者和革命人民，就一定要彻底揭露你们，揪住你们不放，把你们搞臭，搞垮。这也是每一个真正的革命者不可推诿的责任。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”苏修集团就是一伙彻头彻尾的反革命集团。在中东事件中，他们露出了真象，现在又想尽办法要将真象荫蔽起来。但是，不管他们怎样伪装，不管他们搞什么样的假象，不管他们玩弄多少花招，也掩盖不了他们的反革命真面目，挽救不了他们灭亡的命运。
    全世界革命人民，包括苏联人民在内，一定要对这一伙卑鄙龌龊的叛徒和工贼来一个大扫除，把他们扔进历史的垃圾堆！
