The rainy season has arrived on the battlefield in South Vietnam. The brave and skilled liberation armed forces of South Vietnam are taking advantage of this favorable opportunity to continue their victories after crushing the so-called "dry season offensive" of the U.S. aggressors, frequently launching attacks against the enemy.

The liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province, following their heavy blow to the U.S. 4th Infantry Division west of Quang Ngai City at the end of May, again on the morning of June 10th, launched a concentrated artillery barrage against the heavily fortified enemy positions in Quang Ngai City and its surrounding large U.S. military base, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers. A few days earlier, the provincial capital of Thua Thien Province, Hue City, also suffered a fierce artillery bombardment by the liberation armed forces in the dead of night, making the U.S. and puppet forces, who had already endured two bombardments in May, even more anxious. On the morning of June 6th, the liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province also launched a fierce artillery barrage against the supply base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, destroying many helicopters and a large quantity of ammunition and fuel inside the base, causing a massive explosion and a raging fire, seriously damaging the base. On the night of June 2nd, the liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province launched a fierce attack on a battalion of U.S. Marines in a valley southwest of Da Nang. They fired concentrated artillery from the mountains above, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers. Two out of the three company commanders of this battalion were killed. The U.S. military authorities in Da Nang hurriedly dispatched a battalion of U.S. troops to rescue them, but before they reached their destination, they were again heavily attacked by the liberation armed forces. According to the U.S. military authorities, in this 16-hour fierce battle, nearly 400 U.S. soldiers were killed and wounded. In recent days, the liberation armed forces south of the Demilitarized Zone, after achieving significant victories last month, have begun fierce attacks on U.S. bases such as Khe Sanh and Kontum. Sometimes they use fierce artillery fire to bombard the bases, striking at the enemy's strongholds, and sometimes they surround and attack, drawing the enemy out of the bases to fight, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

According to reports, the U.S. invasion command in Saigon has been overwhelmed by urgent calls for help from panicked U.S. invasion forces in various regions, making it difficult to cope. The U.S. Marine Corps south of the Demilitarized Zone, after receiving 18,000 reinforcements from the central and southern battlefields since mid-April, has continued to suffer defeats and is crying out for "insufficient troops." The U.S. 4th Infantry Division in the Central Highlands was severely beaten at the end of May and is shouting "serious situation." The U.S. invasion forces in the Mekong Delta, which have set up layer upon layer of defenses in the south, are like penguins before a storm, screaming "severe lack of mobile forces." Although the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam increased to 462,000 last week, U.S. invasion commander Westmoreland is still urgently requesting Washington to increase the number of troops by 200,000 to 250,000 to cope with the increasingly serious situation.

The news of the U.S. invasion forces suffering heavy casualties in various regions has made Westmoreland even more anxious and troubled. According to reports, Westmoreland has warned the U.S. invasion forces in various regions that larger-scale and more intense battles are imminent. Currently, U.S. troops in various parts of South Vietnam are in a state of constant anxiety.

    在粉碎美帝“旱季攻势”后乘胜前进
    南越解放军展开雨季攻势连连告捷
    平定省解放武装力量在一次战斗中就毙伤美军近四百
    新华社河内十日电　雨季已经来到了南越战场。英勇善战的南越解放武装力量，正利用有利时机在粉碎美国侵略者的所谓“旱季攻势”的凯歌声中，频频出击，进攻敌人。
    波来古省解放武装力量继五月底在波来古市以西痛击美国第四步兵师以后，又在六月十日清晨用密集的炮火轰击了敌人重兵据守的波来古市及其附近的巨大的美军基地，打死打伤很多敌人。在这两天以前，另一个省会承天省的顺化市也在深夜遭到了解放武装力量猛烈的炮击，使得据守这个重要城市、在五月份内已挨过两次炮击的美伪军更加惶惶不安。六月六日清晨，平定省解放武装力量也猛烈炮击了美国第一空中骑兵师的供应基地，摧毁了基地内的许多直升飞机，大量的弹药和汽油，引起了猛烈的爆炸和冲天的大火，严重地破坏了这个基地。六月二日晚，平定省解放武装力量在岘港西南的一个河谷内，猛烈袭击了一营美国海军陆战队。他们在山上居高临下对敌人进行了密集的炮击，打死打伤很多敌人，这个营的三个连长中有两个被打死。岘港美军当局急忙派出一个营的美军去救援，但是还没有到目的地，又遭到解放武装力量的痛击。据美军当局承认，在这次十六小时的激战中，美军被打死打伤近四百人。这些天来，非军事区以南的解放武装力量在上月份取得重大胜利后，又开始了对美军溪星、昆天等基地的猛烈袭击。他们有时用猛烈的炮火轰击基地，痛打敌人的老巢，有时围点打援，把敌人拖出基地来打，给予敌人很大的杀伤。
    据报道，西贡的美国侵略军司令部已被各地区惊慌失措的美国侵略军的告急救援电报，弄得四面楚歌，无法应付。非军事区以南的美国海军陆战队在四月中旬以来从中部和南部战场得到一万八千人的增援后，仍然连吃败仗，叫嚷“兵力不足”。中部高原上的美国第四步兵师在五月底就挨了揍，大叫“局势严重”。在南部湄公河三角洲层层设防的美国侵略军更象暴风雨来临时的企鹅一样，喧嚷地叫喊“严重缺乏机动兵力”。虽然侵越美军上周内已增加到四十六万二千人，但是美国侵略军司令威斯特摩兰还在连连向华盛顿军事当局“紧急要求”再增加二十万到二十五万人，以应付越来越严重的局势。
    各地区美国侵略军损兵折将的消息，更使威斯特摩兰心情紧张，大伤脑筋。据报道，威斯特摩兰已警告各地区的美国侵略军，更大规模和激烈的战斗就在眼前，目前，南越各地的美军终日处于惊慌不安的状态中。（附图片）
