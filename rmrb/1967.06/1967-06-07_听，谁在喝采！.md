The film "The City That Never Sleeps," a poisonous weed concocted based on the reactionary fallacies of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, received cheers from capitalists as soon as it was released. After watching this film, some capitalists in Wuhan and other regions expressed their admiration and sighed deeply. Below, we excerpt some of their statements and provide brief comments. From this, we can see who is welcoming "The City That Never Sleeps" and what kind of stuff it is.

	"Any capitalist starts small and builds their fortune through hard work and frugality."
	"Although capitalists have made money, in the old society, they ensured that workers did not lose their jobs."
	"Not paying wages was not intentional; it was due to cash flow problems. No one wants to be the tallest son but the shortest."

	Comment: So, are capitalists "working their way to wealth" and "deserving of exploitation"? Then, is it not rebellious for workers to revolt?

	This is a reversal of history!

	"The City That Never Sleeps" brought this reversal of history to the screen, earning the applause and cheers of capitalists. What kind of stuff this film is, is now crystal clear!

	Chairman Mao said: "For thousands of years, it has always been said: oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, rebellion is unjustified. Since Marxism came out, this old case has been overturned." "The City That Never Sleeps," following the intentions of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, promotes the hackneyed phrases of "exploitation is justified" and "oppression is justified," which is in line with the reactionary capitalists. They foolishly attempt to overturn the old case that Marxism has overturned, which is a pipe dream that will never happen!

	"Zhang Boke is a man of principle, patriotic, with patriotic thoughts, and it can also be said that the bourgeoisie can consciously accept reform."
	"The scene of joint ventures shows that we have also entered the ranks of the working class, feeling that this is our progress."

	Comment: What "country" does the bourgeoisie love? It is nothing more than the country of bourgeois dictatorship; they do not love the country of proletarian dictatorship at all. The so-called "conscious acceptance of reform" is all fake. Listen! Another capitalist admits: "I see that those who happily hand over their enterprises are non-existent, ... it is only in a situation where there is no other way that one thinks of participating in joint ventures to get rid of the burden." "The City That Never Sleeps" describes "joyfully" entering socialism, which is pure fabrication!

	Capitalists not only do not love the country of proletarian dictatorship but also constantly dream of a restoration. Their so-called "entering the ranks of the working class" is to infiltrate our ranks to carry out subversion; their so-called "entering socialism" is to carry out a capitalist restoration. "The City That Never Sleeps" picks up the broken trumpet of the so-called "peaceful entry into socialism" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, expressing the voice of the bourgeoisie's restoration of capitalism.

	"Qiu Haisheng said: 'The working class does not hold grudges' 'shows the greatness of the Party's policy' 'is to better promote the bourgeoisie's acceptance of reform.' 'The working class has a broad mind, the law is indeed good to us, now we do not talk about class struggle.'"

	Comment: The crux of the film is here. What the capitalists cheer loudly for, and what the film strongly presents, is the abolition of class struggle and the abolition of proletarian dictatorship. This is the same kind of stuff as the "Cultivation" written by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

	What "not holding grudges," what "broad-mindedness," what "better promoting the bourgeoisie's acceptance of reform"! All are the philosophy of class capitulationism of the traitorous elements. If we fall for this, our country will change color, we must not be complacent!

    听，谁在喝采！

    根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动谬论炮制出来的大毒草《不夜城》，一出笼就得到资本家们的喝采。武汉等地区一些资本家看了这部影片后，赞赏之余，大发感慨。下面我们辑录他们的部分言论，略作评注。从这里我们可以看出《不夜城》究竟受谁的欢迎，它究竟是什么货色。
    “任何资本家都是由小到大，勤俭起家的。”
    “资本家虽然发了财，但在旧社会维持了工人不失业。”
    “不发工资也不是故意的，是头寸调不过来，那个人不愿做长子要做矮子。”
    评注：这么说，资本家岂不是“劳动发家”“剥削有功”吗？那么，工人闹革命岂不是大逆不道了吗？
    这是历史的颠倒！
    《不夜城》把这个颠倒历史的反动谬论搬上了银幕，赢得了资本家们的一片掌声和喝采声，这部影片究竟是什么货色，不是昭然若揭了吗？
    毛主席说：“几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。”《不夜城》秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的意旨，鼓吹“剥削有功”“压迫有理”的滥调，这同反动资本家们如出一辙。他们妄图把这个被马克思主义翻过来了的旧案又重新翻回去，这是白日作梦，永远办不到的！
    “张伯韩是有骨气的，是爱国的，他有爱国思想，也可以说明资产阶级是可以自觉地接受改造的”。
    “合营的场面说明了我们也走进了工人阶级的队伍，感到这是我们的进步”。
    评注：资产阶级爱的什么“国”？无非是资产阶级专政的国；对于无产阶级专政的国，他们一点也不爱。所谓“自觉地接受改造”，统统是假的。请听！另一个资本家不打自招地供认：“我看高高兴兴交出企业的人是没得的，……是在没有办法的情况下，才想参加合营丢包袱的。”《不夜城》描写“男欢女喜”进入社会主义，纯属造谣！
    资本家非但不爱无产阶级专政的国，而且时时刻刻梦想复辟。他们所谓“走进工人阶级的队伍”，就是要钻到我们队伍里来搞颠覆；所谓“带进社会主义”，就是实行资本主义复辟。《不夜城》拿起党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所谓“和平长入社会主义”的破喇叭，表达的是资产阶级复辟资本主义的呼声。
    “瞿海生说：‘工人阶级不记私仇’‘说明了党的政策伟大’‘是为了更好地促进资产阶级接受改造。’‘工人阶级心胸宽大，国法对我们确是蛮好，现在不谈阶级斗争’。”
    评注：影片的要害就在这里。资本家大声喝采的，影片大力表现的，就是取消阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政。这和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所著的《修养》是一路货色。
    什么“不记私仇”呀，什么“心胸宽大”呀，什么“更好地促进资产阶级接受改造”呀！通通是工贼们的阶级投降主义的哲学。如果我们上这个当，我们的国家就会改变颜色，我们千万不能掉以轻心啊！
