Vice Premier Chen Speaks at Nepalese Ambassador's Reception on Middle East Situation
Reaffirms China's Stand of Supporting Arab People's Struggle Against U.S., British, and Israeli Aggression
Strongly Condemns Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal of Arab People
Ambassador Subba Holds Reception for King's Birthday, Premier Zhou Enlai and Others Attend

BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) - Nepalese Ambassador to China, Rendi Subba, held a reception today to celebrate the birthday of Nepalese King Mahendra.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and other relevant officials attended the reception at the invitation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered an important speech at the reception on the current Middle East situation. He said that the world is now closely watching the developments in the Middle East. The U.S. imperialists, in collusion with the British imperialists, have directly instigated their lackey Israel to launch a dirty war of aggression against the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other Arab countries, and have directly participated in this war of aggression. This is another grave act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism against the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. The Arab people of various countries have united as one, with common hatred and indignation, and have given a fierce counterattack to the U.S., British, and Israeli aggressors. The entire Arab region has been swept by a storm of struggle against U.S. aggression. After the U.S. imperialists themselves ignited the war of aggression in the Middle East, they have, through the United Nations, concocted a so-called "ceasefire resolution," attempting to force the Arab people to surrender and allow their lackey Israel to ride roughshod over the Arab people. It is absolutely intolerable for the U.S. imperialists to bully the Arab people in this way.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese government has solemnly declared: The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and engaged in a victorious Cultural Revolution, stand firmly on the side of the Arab people and resolutely support their just war against U.S., British, and Israeli aggression. The Chinese people's stand of supporting the Arab people will never change.

He said that the Soviet revisionist leadership, just as in the case of Vietnam, has once again played the shameful role of false support and true betrayal in the Arab people's war against U.S., British, and Israeli aggression.

Before the war of aggression was launched, they did not condemn the U.S. imperialists' plot of aggression, did not support the Arab countries in taking self-defense countermeasures, but engaged in backroom deals with the U.S. imperialists to lull the Arab countries. After the war of aggression was launched, they still did not condemn the U.S. imperialists' crimes of aggression, did not support the Arab people's war of resistance against aggression, but joined the U.S. imperialists in pushing for "immediate ceasefire" and "ceasefire within a time limit" in the United Nations to betray the Arab people. This is another exposure of the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionists.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that through this practice of anti-aggression struggle, the Arab people have seen more clearly that U.S. imperialism is their sworn enemy, and Soviet revisionism is the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists. They are colluding to try to control the fate of the Arab people. But this is their futile wish. The Arab nation is a nation with a long history and a glorious anti-imperialist tradition. The Arab people are a heroic people. Their just struggle against the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel is winning increasingly broad sympathy and support from the people of the world. Whether it is the war tactics of the U.S. and British imperialists and their lackeys, or the betrayal and deception of Soviet revisionism, they cannot extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle, but will only serve as negative teachers. As pointed out by Chairman Mao, the greatest leader of the Chinese people: "The surging tide of the people of the world against the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will certainly achieve even greater victories." Vice Premier Chen Yi concluded by saying that we believe that the final victory will belong to the Arab people who persist in anti-imperialism, struggle, and unity.

At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Rendi Subba delivered a speech. In his speech, he introduced the economic construction of Nepal and talked about Nepal's policy of non-alignment and strict neutrality in foreign affairs.

Ambassador Rendi Subba warmly praised the friendly relations between the two peoples of Nepal and China.

He said that Nepal and China have always been good neighbors and good friends. Not long ago, the road connecting Kathmandu and Lhasa, Tibet, China, was officially opened to traffic. This is a road of friendship, which will greatly help Nepal's economy. The construction of this road is one of the many technical and financial aid projects that China has provided to us without any conditions. The Chinese technical personnel in Nepal are all excellent envoys of China. They are loyal to their duties, work hard, and are impartial and upright, which has won the love of our people. We are happy with every new achievement of China.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke. In his speech, he said that the Nepalese people are a people who love freedom and independence and have a glorious history of resisting foreign aggression and defending their homeland. Since King Mahendra took the throne, he has led the Kingdom of Nepal to continue the struggle against imperialism and external reactionary forces that attempt to interfere with and control Nepal's internal affairs, and has achieved victories. In national construction, the Nepalese government has also made effective efforts. The Chinese government and people express support for this and wish you new achievements.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that in recent years, the friendly relations between China and Nepal have developed significantly. What is particularly gratifying is that the Kathmandu-Kodari Road, jointly built by the two countries, has been completed and officially opened to traffic. King Mahendra personally presided over the opening ceremony of this road. This road was born in the face of natural obstacles such as high mountains and in the face of various obstacles from imperialism, modern revisionism, and expansionism. We believe that the economic cooperation, trade, cultural exchanges, and friendly exchanges between the two countries will become closer and more developed.

Envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

Yesterday, Nepalese Consul General to Lhasa, Rana, held a reception to celebrate the birthday of Nepalese King Mahendra.

    陈副总理在尼泊尔大使招待会上就中东局势发表讲话
    重申中国支持阿拉伯人民抗击美英以侵略的立场
    痛斥苏修对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的叛徒行为
    苏巴大使为庆祝国王生日举行招待会，周恩来总理等到会祝贺
    据新华社十二日讯　尼泊尔驻中国大使伦迪尔·苏巴今天举行招待会，庆祝尼泊尔国王马亨德拉生日。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若以及各有关方面负责人，应邀出席了招待会。
    陈毅副总理在招待会上就当前中东局势发表重要讲话。他说，现在全世界都在注视着中东局势的发展。美帝国主义伙同英帝国主义，直接指使它的走狗以色列，向阿联、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家发动了肮脏的侵略战争，而且直接参预了这场侵略战争。这是美帝国主义对亚非人民和全世界人民又一次最严重的战争挑衅。阿拉伯各国人民团结一致，同仇敌忾，对美国、英国、以色列侵略者给以猛烈的回击。整个阿拉伯地区掀起了一片反美侵略的斗争大风暴。美帝国主义亲手点燃了侵略中东的战火以后，又通过联合国炮制出一项所谓“停火决议”，企图迫使阿拉伯人民屈膝投降，让它的走狗以色列骑在阿拉伯人民的头上。美帝国主义如此欺侮阿拉伯人民，这是绝对不能容忍的。
    陈毅副总理说，中国政府已经庄严宣告：用毛泽东思想武装起来的、正在胜利进行着无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，坚决支持他们反对美、英、以侵略的正义战争。中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民的立场，是永远不会改变的。
    他说，苏修领导集团，象它们在越南问题上所采取的立场和态度一样，在这次阿拉伯人民抗击美帝、英帝、以色列侵略的战争中，再一次扮演了假支持、真出卖的可耻角色。
    在侵略战争发动以前，它们不谴责美帝的侵略阴谋，不支持阿拉伯国家采取自卫反击行动，而同美帝搞幕后交易来麻痹阿拉伯国家。在侵略战争发动以后，它们仍不谴责美帝的侵略罪行，不支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争，而同美帝一起在联合国搞“立即停火”、“限期停火”，来出卖阿拉伯人民。这是苏修叛徒面目的又一次大暴露。
    陈毅副总理说，阿拉伯人民从这次反侵略斗争的实践中，更加清楚地看到：美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民不共戴天的死敌，苏联修正主义是美帝的头号帮凶。他们正串通一气，力图控制阿拉伯人民的命运。但这是他们的痴心妄想。阿拉伯民族是具有悠久历史和光荣反帝传统的民族，阿拉伯人民是英雄的人民。他们反对美国、英国、以色列侵略的正义斗争，正在赢得全世界人民越来越广泛的同情和支持。不论是美英帝国主义及其走狗的战争手段，还是苏联修正主义的出卖欺骗，都不能扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的烈火，而只会起到反面教员的作用。正如中国人民最伟大的领袖毛主席所指出的：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”陈毅副总理最后说，我们相信，最后胜利一定属于坚持反帝、坚持斗争、坚持团结的阿拉伯人民。
    在招待会开始的时候，伦迪尔·苏巴大使首先讲话。他在讲话中介绍了尼泊尔经济建设的情况，谈到了尼泊尔奉行的不结盟和严守中立的外交政策。
    伦迪尔·苏巴大使热烈赞扬尼中两国人民的友好关系。
    他说，尼泊尔和中国一向是好邻居、好朋友。不久前，连接加德满都和中华人民共和国西藏拉萨之间的科达里公路宣告通车。这是一条友谊之路，它将大大有助于尼泊尔的经济。这条公路的修建，是中国为了尼泊尔的发展所给予我们的、不带任何条件的许多技术和财政援助项目之一。在尼泊尔的中国技术人员，都是中国在尼泊尔的优秀使者。他们忠于职守，努力工作，大公无私和举止正派，已经赢得了我国人民的爱戴。我们为中国的每一项新成就而感到高兴。
    陈毅副总理接着讲了话。他在讲话中说，尼泊尔人民是爱好自由和独立的人民，有着反对外来侵略、保卫祖国的光荣历史。马亨德拉国王亲政以来，领导尼泊尔王国继续同企图干涉和控制尼泊尔内政的帝国主义和外来的反动势力进行斗争，并且取得胜利。在国家建设方面，尼泊尔王国政府也作了有成效的努力。中国政府和人民对此表示支持，并且祝愿你们取得新的成就。
    陈毅副总理说，近几年来，中国和尼泊尔的友好关系有了显著的发展。特别令人高兴的是，我们两国共同修筑的加德满都—科达里公路，已经全部完工，正式通车。马亨德拉国王亲自主持了这条公路的通车典礼。这条公路是在征服高山峻岭的自然障碍，和不断冲破帝国主义、现代修正主义和扩张主义的各种阻挠中诞生的。我们相信，中尼两国的经济合作，贸易、文化交流和友好往来，必将日益密切，更加发展。
    各国驻中国使节也出席了招待会。
    昨天，尼泊尔驻拉萨总领事拉纳，为庆祝尼泊尔国王马亨德拉生日举行了招待会。
