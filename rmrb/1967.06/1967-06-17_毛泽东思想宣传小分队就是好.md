Under the nurturing of the boundless Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art, Shanghai has emerged with thousands of Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads, which are warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. These squads, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force and Red Guards as the vanguard, are active in factories, fields, units, schools, streets, ports, docks, trains, and ships. They closely follow the political struggle situation and vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought. The momentum of their propaganda is unprecedented, the mobilization of the masses is extensive, and the popularization of Mao Zedong Thought is profound. Especially in the current great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, they use literary and artistic weapons to fiercely attack the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They have played a very powerful role in promoting the great criticism of the revolution, the great unity of the revolution, and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads, which have emerged from the workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards, are an indispensable "gear and screw" in the entire Shanghai proletarian cultural revolution machine. They have opened up a broad path for the masses to take up literary and artistic weapons and vigorously spread Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great achievement of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries on the literary and artistic front, and a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads have emerged from the storms of class struggle and are fighters on the front line of the proletarian cultural revolution. The severe class struggle has made them understand that literature and art are very powerful weapons. If the proletariat does not seize this weapon, the bourgeoisie will. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionaries must use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the political stage and also use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the artistic stage, which has been dominated by the old masters, ladies, young masters, and young mistresses, so that the broad masses can further grasp Mao Zedong Thought through literary and artistic propaganda. From this point of departure, the broad workers and peasants of Shanghai and the Red Guards have learned from the good example of the PLA in carrying out revolutionary mass literary and artistic activities. They have organized Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads, taken up literary and artistic weapons, and loudly shouted and danced for "uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy."

These Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads, which mainly engage in comprehensive literary and artistic propaganda, are not equipped with instruments that are supposedly "beautiful and moving" to the bourgeoisie or the "exquisite" performances of a few individuals. Instead, they are armed with the most powerful Mao Zedong Thought. Their deep love for Chairman Mao and their unwavering loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, as well as their deep hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, fill their performances with strong revolutionary passion.

Someone said, "The squads sing about politics." Indeed, that is the case. From the day the squads were established, the members have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary ideological struggle and artistic struggle must serve the political struggle, because only through politics can the needs of the class and the masses be concentratedly expressed." The squads are here to sing about politics, to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They firmly oppose and do not allow anyone to peddle the revisionist politics of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party on the stage. They also oppose treating literary and artistic propaganda as mere "entertainment" or "art appreciation." Entertainment for the sake of entertainment and pure art appreciation above classes do not exist in reality; they are mere deceit. Every time the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads perform, they solemnly declare at the beginning or end: "We are here to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and jointly ascend the literary and artistic stage. If there are any parts of our performance that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we welcome criticism. If others perform literary and artistic programs that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will also criticize them." After watching the politically charged programs performed by the squads, the broad revolutionary masses said: "When watching a play, one must look at the direction. The squads sing about Mao Zedong Thought, which is excellent."

Someone said, "The squads' performances are for workers, peasants, and soldiers." This is completely correct. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads are here to serve the proletariat and to help the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers better grasp Mao Zedong Thought, promote ideological revolutionization, and enhance their fighting spirit and confidence in victory. Therefore, the squads' performances are full of enthusiasm, singing the praises of the new people, new things, and new ideas of the proletarian revolutionary cadres in the three great revolutionary struggles. They use short, concise, and varied artistic performance forms that are popular among workers, peasants, and soldiers. To facilitate the workers, peasants, and soldiers in seizing the revolution, promoting production, and preparing for war, they prioritize politics, quickly create and perform, travel light, and bring the performances to the doorsteps of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They popularize and elevate the performances for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their programs have been warmly welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Someone said, "The squads perform with loud shouts and lack artistic appeal." Speaking of the squads shouting loudly, this is correct. In promoting Mao Zedong Thought, we must show the greatest enthusiasm and sing loudly; in cheering for revolutionary causes, we must use all our strength and shout loudly; in facing all reactionary and decaying things, we must frown and criticize them fiercely. This is the distinct class hatred and revolutionary fighting style of the proletarian revolutionaries. Such "loud shouting" is excellent. Saying that the squads' performances "lack artistic appeal" is talking nonsense with one's eyes closed. Just presenting some facts can refute this wrong view. In the great criticism of the revolution, the group recitation "Down with China's Khrushchev," the Tianjin clapper talk "Thoroughly Criticize the Black 'Cultivation,'" and the performance-singing "Never Forget Class Bitterness, Remember Blood Debts" and other programs have aroused the broad revolutionary masses' deep hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, who have betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat. The small songs and dances based on the "Three Articles" are loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, who never tire of watching them. These facts strongly prove that the squads' literary and artistic programs have great vitality and artistic appeal.

Currently, more Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads are emerging on various fronts in Shanghai. This very encouraging situation fully shows that the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads have vigorous vitality and unlimited development prospects. They are a new development in mass socialist literature and art and embody the great direction of revolutionary literature and art. We need tens of thousands of such literary and artistic cavalry—Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squads—to fight on various fronts, take root among the broad workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards, and spread the great Mao Zedong Thought to every heart. Let millions of revolutionary masses be more united and fiercely attack the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

### 毛泽东思想宣传小分队就是好

    毛泽东思想宣传小分队就是好
    在光焰无际的毛泽东文艺思想的哺育下，上海涌现出来了千百个深受广大革命群众热烈欢迎的毛泽东思想宣传小分队。这些小分队以工农兵为主力，以红卫兵为先锋，活跃在车间、田头、连队、学校、街头、港口、码头以及列车上和轮船上，紧密结合政治斗争形势，大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想，其宣传威势之迅猛，动员群众之广泛，普及毛泽东思想之深入，是空前未有的。特别在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，他们运用文艺武器向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，对革命的大批判以及革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，起了十分有力的推动和促进作用。
    从工农兵群众和红卫兵小将中涌现出来的毛泽东思想宣传小分队这一新事物，是整个上海无产阶级文化大革命机器中不可缺少的“齿轮和螺丝钉”。它开辟了群众自己拿起文艺武器，大力传播毛泽东思想的广阔途径。这是上海无产阶级革命派在文艺战线上所取得的伟大成果，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的新胜利。
    毛泽东思想宣传小分队是从阶级斗争的大风大浪中杀出来的，是站在无产阶级文化大革命斗争前线的战斗员。严峻的阶级斗争使他们懂得，文艺是个非常厉害的武器，这个武器无产阶级不去掌握，资产阶级就要去掌握。因此，无产阶级革命派要用毛泽东思想占领政治舞台，同时，也要用毛泽东思想去占领被老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着的艺术舞台，使广大群众从文艺宣传中更进一步掌握毛泽东思想。从这一点出发，上海广大工农群众和红卫兵小将学习了解放军开展革命的群众文艺活动的好榜样，纷纷组织起毛泽东思想宣传小分队，拿起文艺武器，为“团结自己、战胜敌人”而大喊大叫，大唱大跳。
    这种以综合性文艺宣传为主的毛泽东思想宣传小分队，不是靠什么为资产阶级所欣赏的所谓“优美动人”的乐器和少数人的“精湛”演技来武装的，而是靠最强大的毛泽东思想武装起来的。对毛主席的无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想的无限忠诚；对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的刻骨仇恨，使他们的演出充满着强烈的革命激情。
    有人说：“小分队演唱的都是政治”。正是这样。毛泽东思想宣传小分队的成员们从建队那一天起，就牢记毛主席的教导：“革命的思想斗争和艺术斗争，必须服从于政治的斗争，因为只有经过政治，阶级和群众的需要才能集中地表现出来。”小分队就是要演唱政治，就是要大力宣传毛泽东思想，大力宣传无产阶级专政。他们坚决反对和绝不允许有人在舞台上贩卖党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义政治。他们也反对把文艺宣传单纯地当作什么“娱乐”，什么“艺术欣赏”。为娱乐而娱乐的文艺、超阶级的纯艺术欣赏，实际上是不存在的，是欺人之谈。毛泽东思想宣传小分队每次演出开始或结束，都庄严地公开宣告：“我们是为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，共同杀上文艺舞台来的。我们演出的节目，如果有不符合毛泽东思想的地方，欢迎大家造我们的反。别人如果演不符合毛泽东思想的文艺节目，我们一样要造他们的反。”广大革命群众看了小分队演出的富有强烈政治性的节目以后说：看戏要看方向，小分队演唱的都是毛泽东思想，好得很。
    有人说：“小分队演唱的节目是给工农兵看的。”完全正确。毛泽东思想宣传小分队就是要为无产阶级服务，就是要让广大工农兵更好地去掌握毛泽东思想，促进思想革命化，提高他们的斗争热情和胜利信心。因此，小分队的演唱节目都是满腔热情地歌颂无产阶级革命派在三大革命斗争中的新人新事新思想，采用了工农兵群众所喜闻乐见的短小精悍的多样化的艺术表演形式。为了有利于工农兵抓革命、促生产、促战备，他们政治第一，快编快演，轻装上台，送戏上门。他们向工农兵普及，向工农兵提高。他们的节目受到了工农兵的最热烈的欢迎。
    有人说：“小分队表演时大喊大叫，没有艺术感染力”。讲小分队大喊大叫，这话讲对了。宣传毛泽东思想，我们就是要拿出最大的热情，引吭高歌；为革命的事物呐喊助威，我们就是要使出全身的力量，大声疾呼；对一切反动腐朽的事物，我们就是要横眉冷对，痛加斥责。这是我们无产阶级革命派鲜明的阶级爱憎，革命的战斗风格。这样的“大喊大叫”好得很。说小分队的表演“没有艺术感染力”，这是闭着眼睛说瞎话。只要举一些事实就可驳倒这种错误看法。在革命的大批判中，群口词《打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫》、天津快板《彻底批判黑〈修养〉》以及表演唱《不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇》等节目，激发了广大革命群众对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政的刻骨仇恨。根据“老三篇”分别编演的小歌舞，工农兵群众百看不厌。这些事实有力地证明了小分队的文艺节目具有强大的生命力和艺术感染力。
    目前，上海各条战线上有更多的毛泽东思想宣传小分队在不断涌现出来。这种十分可喜的局面，充分表明了毛泽东思想宣传小分队具有旺盛的生命力和无限的发展前途。它是群众性社会主义文艺的新发展，它体现了革命文艺的大方向。我们正是需要有千千万万个这样的文艺轻骑兵——“毛泽东思想宣传小分队”战斗在各条战线上，扎根在广大工农兵和红卫兵小将之中，把伟大的毛泽东思想传到每个人的心里，让千百万革命群众更加团结一致，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派更猛烈地开火，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
