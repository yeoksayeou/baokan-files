The revolutionary ballet "Red Detachment of Women" was created under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the direct leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, amidst a fierce struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party and the revisionist literary and artistic black line they supported. This is a groundbreaking achievement in the history of ballet, serving as an excellent example of the practical application of the principles of "learning from the past to serve the present" and "learning from foreign cultures to serve China." It marks the end of old ballet, which served the bourgeoisie and revisionism, and the birth of proletarian ballet, which serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The creation and performance of the revolutionary ballet "Red Detachment of Women" have achieved remarkable successes in both ideological content and artistic form, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionization of ballet.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords through the force of the gun." The most outstanding achievement of "Red Detachment of Women" lies in its passionate praise of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on armed struggle and people's war, powerfully illustrating the truth that the oppressed classes can only seize political power by taking up arms and following the Party and Chairman Mao to thoroughly make revolution and overthrow the exploiting classes. "Red Detachment of Women" depicts a unit of the Red Army fighting in Hainan Island during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, growing and strengthening under the Party's leadership. It not only accurately portrays the life and struggles of the Red Army but also showcases the deep bond between the Red Army and the Red Guards, and between the Red Army and the common people. It enthusiastically praises the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary spirit of the Red Army and the people.

Another outstanding achievement of "Red Detachment of Women" is the successful creation of vivid images of proletarian revolutionary heroes such as Wu Qinghua and Hong Changqing. Wu Qinghua is a character imbued with revolutionary spirit. Originally a young female slave in the household of the evil landlord Nan Batian, she escapes from captivity and joins the "Red Detachment of Women" led by the Party. The ballet realistically and deeply portrays Wu Qinghua's arduous journey to the revolutionary base and her joining the Red Detachment of Women. To express Wu Qinghua's deep hatred and her resolute determination to join the Red Army, the choreographers use contrast and emphasis to create a vivid depiction. Amidst joyful and bright music, a lively scene unfolds where the people of the Red Army base celebrate the establishment of the Red Detachment of Women. Here, the poor people have been liberated, enjoying the happiness brought by the Communist Party and beloved Chairman Mao. This contrasts sharply with the brutal rule of the Nationalist reactionaries and the landlord Nan Batian in the coconut grove. When Wu Qinghua arrives at the base, she sees the flying red flags and rushes over, tears welling up in her eyes as if she has found her parents. In this scene, Wu Qinghua's dance segments, where she denounces Nan Batian's cruel torture and vows to avenge her suffering, are particularly successful. When Wu Qinghua recounts how Nan Batian beat her until she was covered in wounds, the audience sways with her movements, showing their deep sympathy and indicating that Wu Qinghua's pain and hatred are not just personal but shared by the laboring masses. When Wu Qinghua finally joins the detachment and receives a gun, her emotions reach a peak. Through this scene, the character of Wu Qinghua comes to life.

The deeper significance of Wu Qinghua's character lies in her transformation, under the Party's loving guidance and through the trials of revolutionary warfare, from a spontaneous rebel into a conscious proletarian revolutionary fighter. After joining the army, Wu Qinghua's thinking was limited to the level of personal revenge. When she was on a reconnaissance mission and saw her enemy Nan Batian, she could not suppress her desire for revenge and fired a shot, injuring Nan Batian and prematurely exposing our troops, disrupting the battle plan, and allowing the enemy to escape. This mistake gave Wu Qinghua a profound lesson. With the help and guidance of Party representative Hong Changqing and the female platoon leader, she understood the great truth that the proletariat can only liberate themselves by liberating all humanity. Through practical struggles, she finally became a steadfast proletarian fighter.

Although Hong Changqing appears less frequently than Wu Qinghua, his role is more important as he represents the Party's leadership. Describing Wu Qinghua's growth process is, in a sense, also describing Hong Changqing. Hong Changqing embodies the sublime qualities of a proletarian revolutionary fighter: fearlessness, the spirit of "heading to the chopping block without flinching as long as the cause is just," a clear class stance of being ruthless to enemies and lenient to oneself, and excellent work habits of being one with the masses. He is a typical revolutionary fighter of the older generation and a great example for today's proletarian revolutionaries to learn from.

Hong Changqing was seriously wounded while covering the main force's retreat and captured by the enemy. Nan Batian, fearing our army's advance, used every trick of coercion and bribery to try to make Hong Changqing write a surrender letter. Hong Changqing fiercely denounced the enemy's vile plot, tore up the paper, and threw it in the enemy's face. To highlight Hong Changqing's majestic image, the dance features a powerful and unrestrained jumping sequence, contrasting sharply with the surrounding bandits who are crouching and helpless, emphasizing the magnificent image of Hong Changqing. This portrayal powerfully embodies our army's revolutionary heroism spirit of "crushing all enemies and never being subdued by them." If such revolutionary fighters are like towering trees, then the top capitalist-roader within the Party and a handful of traitors who advocate betrayal philosophy and betray proletarian dictatorship are nothing but decaying leaves.

In character arrangement, "Red Detachment of Women" completely breaks free from the formalistic shackles of old ballet, giving even minor characters and group dancers distinct personalities. For example, the female platoon leader, the young messenger, the old cook, the children performing in the celebration of the Red Detachment of Women's establishment, and the Red Guards in the "Five-Inch Knife Dance," all have their unique traits. The portrayal of negative characters also captures their different characteristics to reveal their reactionary essence and ugly souls.

Another outstanding achievement of "Red Detachment of Women" is its adherence to Chairman Mao's teachings: "The unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible" and the principle of "learning from foreign cultures to serve China." While reforming the content, it also boldly innovates in artistic form, establishing a new socialist style and a unique proletarian character. It sweeps away the old ballet's ethereal, decadent, and absurd style, replacing it with a fresh, lively, and robust style. It incorporates elements of Chinese classical and folk dances into the original ballet foundation, while also creating new dance vocabulary based on real life. For example, to depict Hong Changqing's resolute character, Chinese classical dance techniques like swordplay and "flying kicks" are used. Additionally, dances like the "Five-Inch Knife Dance" and the "Lychee Dance," adapted from the folk dances of the Li ethnic group, are organically integrated into the ballet to showcase the bravery and wit of the young Red Guards and the people's love for the Red Army. Furthermore, the ballet's music closely follows the plot, focusing on character portrayal and being rich in combativeness. The melody of the Red Detachment of Women's song varies with the plot, emphasizing the heroic image of the detachment throughout the performance. In many places, it also uses local folk music elements, such as the main theme music for Qinghua, which is derived from Hainan folk tunes. Through these transformations, ballet, which once only served foreign royalty and the bourgeoisie, has become a "fresh, lively, and for the Chinese people to love and appreciate" ballet with a Chinese style and spirit.

Western ballet art has decayed. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, ballet has been reborn in our country! Revolutionary ballet will not only have an immeasurable impact in our country but also in the global cultural revolution!

    为革命的芭蕾舞大喊大叫
    谈革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的成就
    北京芭蕾舞蹈学校　群力
    革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在江青同志直接指导下，同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他支持的修正主义文艺黑线激烈斗争中产生的第一个革命的芭蕾舞。这是芭蕾舞史上划时代的创举，是具体实践“古为今用”、“洋为中用”的卓越范例。它宣告为资产阶级、修正主义服务的旧芭蕾舞在中国从此结束，为工农兵服务的无产阶级的芭蕾舞从此诞生了。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的创作和演出，不论在思想内容和艺术形式创造方面，都取得了可喜的成就，为芭蕾舞的革命树立了光辉的样板。
    毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主”。《红色娘子军》最突出的成就首先在于：它热情地歌颂了毛主席的武装斗争、人民战争的光辉思想，有力地说明了被压迫阶级只有拿起枪杆子，跟着党和毛主席彻底闹革命，大造剥削阶级的反，才能夺取政权的真理。《红色娘子军》描写的是第二次国内革命战争时期，一支战斗在海南岛的工农红军，在党的领导下成长壮大的过程。它不仅正确地描绘了工农红军的生活和斗争，同时也表现了红军和赤卫队、红军和老百姓的鱼水关系。它满腔热情地赞扬了工农红军和人民群众的革命英雄主义和革命造反精神。
    《红色娘子军》另一个突出的成就是，成功地塑造了吴清华、洪常青等光彩夺目的无产阶级革命战士的英雄形象。吴清华是个具有革命造反精神的人物形象。她原是大恶霸地主南霸天府中的一个青年女奴，在九死一生中冲出牢笼，投奔了党领导的一支“红色娘子军”。舞剧真实而又深刻地表现出吴清华经历了千辛万苦，来到根据地参加红色娘子军的情景。为了表现吴清华的深仇大恨和她要求参加红军的坚定决心，编导运用对比、烘托等手法，作了精细的描写。在一片欢快明朗的乐曲声中，展开了一幅红军根据地人民载歌载舞庆祝红色娘子军连成立的热烈场面。在这里，穷人们彻底翻身了，他们充分享受着中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席给他们带来的幸福。这同国民党反动派、地主老财南霸天残暴统治下的椰林寨，形成了强烈的对照。当吴清华来到根据地的时候，她看到飘扬的红旗，立即扑过去，象见到亲生爹娘一样，激动得热泪盈眶。在这场戏里，吴清华控诉南霸天残酷折磨她的罪行和她表示誓死要报仇雪恨的两大段舞蹈，设计是非常成功的。当吴清华讲到南霸天如何打得她遍体鳞伤，场上的人都随着她的身躯和手势左右晃动，表明吴清华的痛苦遭遇引起了他们深切的同情，也说明吴清华的苦和仇不仅仅是个人的，而是劳动人民共同的阶级苦，阶级仇。当吴清华实现了自己的愿望，加入了娘子军，并得到一支枪的时候，她的情绪达到顶点。通过这一场戏，吴清华这个人物已经活生生地树立起来了。
    吴清华这个形象更为深刻的意义，还在于她在党的亲切关怀教导下，在革命战争的锻炼中，从一个自发的反抗者成长为一个自觉的无产阶级革命战士。吴清华参军后，由于她的思想局限在单纯的“报仇”这个水平上，当她执行侦察任务，看见仇人南霸天的时候，压制不住复仇的怒火，擅自开枪打伤了南霸天，从而过早地暴露了我军，破坏了战斗部署，让敌人逃走了。这个错误，给了吴清华极为深刻的教训，经过党代表洪常青和女连长的帮助教育，她懂得了无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的伟大真理。经过实际斗争的锻炼，她终于成为一个坚强的无产阶级战士。
    党代表洪常青这个人物，所占的篇幅虽然不及吴清华多，但地位却更为重要，他是作为党的领导者出现的。描写吴清华的成长过程，从某种意义上说，也是描写洪常青。洪常青的形象集中了无产阶级革命战士的崇高品质：无私无畏的伟大气魄，“砍头不要紧，只要主义真”的硬骨头精神，对敌狠、对己和的鲜明的阶级感情，和群众打成一片的优良作风。他是老一辈革命战士的典型，也是今天我们无产阶级革命派学习的好榜样。
    洪常青由于掩护主力部队转移时身负重伤，落入敌人手中。南霸天慑于我军的进攻，使尽威逼利诱的伎俩，要洪常青写退兵信。洪常青痛斥敌人的卑劣阴谋，撕碎了信纸狠狠扔到敌人脸上。为了突出洪常青大义凛然的伟大形象，在舞蹈处理上，运用了一大段最强烈、最豪放的腾跳，与四周手执刀枪的匪徒弯腰屈腿、无可奈何的狼狈相，形成鲜明的对比，突出了光辉高大的洪常青的形象。这段处理，有力地体现了我军“压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的革命英雄主义精神。如果说这样的革命战士是参天大树，那么，宣扬叛徒哲学、背叛无产阶级专政的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派以及一小撮叛徒，不过是腐草败叶。
    《红色娘子军》在人物安排上，根本抛弃了旧芭蕾舞的形式主义枷锁，使许多次要人物以至群舞中的成员，也都具有一定的个性。如女连长、小通讯员、老炊事员、在欢庆娘子军连成立大会上表演斗争南霸天的小孩们，以及《五寸刀舞》中的赤卫队等等。反面人物的塑造，也能抓住他们各自不同的特点来表现他们的反动本质和丑恶灵魂。
    《红色娘子军》又一个突出的成就是，遵循毛主席所教导的：“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”和“洋为中用”的原则，在内容上进行改革的时候，在艺术形式上也进行了大胆的创造，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，把旧芭蕾舞虚无缥缈、颓废荒诞的风气一扫而光，代之以新鲜活泼、刚健朴实的风格。它在原来芭蕾舞的基础上适当掺进了中国古典舞和民间舞的因素，同时又从现实生活出发，创造了一些新的舞蹈语汇。例如，为了表现洪常青的刚毅性格，使用了中国古典舞耍刀和“飞脚”等。再如，根据黎族民间舞蹈改编的《五寸刀舞》和《荔枝舞》等，也被有机地用进舞剧当中，表现了青年赤卫队的勇敢机智和群众对红军的热爱。此外，舞剧的音乐紧密配合剧情，着力于人物形象塑造，富有战斗性。娘子军连歌的旋律，根据剧情的变化作了各种不同的处理，贯穿着全剧，处处树立娘子军的英雄形象。在许多地方还运用了富有地方色彩的民间音乐素材，如清华的主题音乐就是脱胎于海南民间乐曲的。经过这一改造，一贯只能为外国王公贵族和资产阶级老爷服务的芭蕾舞，变成了“新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”的芭蕾舞了。
    西方的芭蕾艺术已经腐朽了。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，芭蕾在我国得到了新生！革命的芭蕾舞，不仅在我国，而且也必将在全世界文化革命中产生不可估量的影响！
