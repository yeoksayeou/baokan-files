The brave and skilled military and civilian forces of South Vietnam, in the seven years of anti-American resistance and national salvation from 1961 to April 1967, not only fought the invading U.S. ground forces to a standstill but also dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. air pirates, achieving the glorious victory of shooting down and destroying 6,404 enemy aircraft. This shattered the boast of U.S. imperialism about its "air superiority."

According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, in the second dry season battles from October 1966 to April 1967 alone, the South Vietnamese military and civilians shot down and destroyed 1,800 enemy aircraft. During this period, the liberation armed forces launched 44 fierce attacks on 25 enemy airfields and military bases, destroying or severely damaging 968 enemy aircraft.

The Vietnam People's Daily recently published a commentary pointing out that U.S. imperialism, in its aggression against Vietnam, regarded the air force as a "protection" for its ground forces and placed great hopes in it. However, the facts have shown that the invaders' steel cannot save them from their doomed fate. The military and civilians of South Vietnam do not have airplanes or missiles, but they possess a force that makes the enemy very afraid. This is the love for their country and the deep hatred for the enemy that the military and civilians of South Vietnam have, which gives rise to their courageous spirit.

    大破美帝“空中优势”
    南越军民七年战斗击毁敌机六千四百多架
    新华社河内十一日电  英勇善战的越南南方军民，在一九六一年到一九六七年四月的七年抗美救国战斗中，不仅把地面上的美国侵略军打得落花流水，同时沉重地打击了美国空中强盗，取得了击落、击毁敌机六千四百零四架的辉煌胜利，挫败了美帝国主义吹嘘的“空中优势”。
    据越南通讯社报道，仅在一九六六年十月到一九六七年四月的第二次旱季战斗中，南越军民就击落击毁敌机一千八百架。在这期间，解放武装力量对敌人的二十五个机场和军事基地发动了四十四次的猛烈袭击，击毁或重创敌机九百六十八架。
    越南《人民报》最近发表评论指出，美帝国主义在侵越战争中，认为空军是地面部队的“护身符”，对空军寄以很大的希望。但是事实表明，侵略者的钢铁挽救不了他们失败的命运。越南南方军民没有飞机和导弹，但是他们具有使敌人感到十分害怕的雄厚力量。这就是越南南方军民对祖国的热爱和对敌人的深仇大恨以及由此而产生的勇敢精神。
