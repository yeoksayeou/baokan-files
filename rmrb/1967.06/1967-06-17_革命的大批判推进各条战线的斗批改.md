The proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai has entered a new stage. Revolutionary criticism is advancing the struggle, criticism, and reform on all fronts. Closely following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, emphasizing proletarian politics, mobilizing the masses, and fiercely striking down the greatest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, has promoted revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," seized the revolution, and promoted production, consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 16 - Our correspondent's commentary: After the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries achieved a major victory in the power seizure struggle in the "January Revolution" storm, they firmly grasped the principal contradiction, steadfastly held the direction of the struggle, continued to mobilize the masses, and combined revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the Shanghai region. With a great revolutionary spirit, they launched a comprehensive offensive and a powerful struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, driving the revolutionary struggle forward.

Currently, the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai is excellent and getting better. The decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has entered a new stage: taking revolutionary criticism as the key, concentrating forces to strike down the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, promoting, consolidating, and developing revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," advancing the struggle, criticism, and reform on all fronts, consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensuring that the proletarian revolutionaries truly seize, hold, and use power well.

A good example of combining revolutionary criticism with local struggle, criticism, and reform

The struggle and criticism in the Shanghai region are mainly centered around the "Meeting to Highly Hold Up the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Thoroughly Settle Accounts with the Anti-Revolutionary Crimes of the Biggest Handful of Capitalist-roaders within the Old Shanghai Municipal Committee," convened by the united Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, such struggle meetings have been held seven times since March.

After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee in the "January Revolution" storm, the situation faced new challenges: on one hand, although the old Shanghai Municipal Committee had been overthrown, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines within the committee needed to be further deepened. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were unwilling to accept their defeat and attempted to stage a comeback. Although they had been politically and organizationally overthrown, the poison they spread, along with their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, in various aspects, had not been thoroughly cleansed. The entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods they promoted still had its social base. Due to the poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique" in the cadre issue, many leading cadres had not yet returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On the other hand, the proletarian revolutionaries who had taken power faced the task of how to hold and use power well, but they lacked experience. Some comrades were bogged down in mundane affairs, while others forgot the direction of the struggle and were keen on fighting unprincipled "internal wars," etc. The contradictions and tasks facing the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries were indeed numerous and complex.

In such a situation, what was the direction of the struggle? What should be grasped? How should it be grasped? The Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the situation is constantly changing, and to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must learn," seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of important instructions and related works on the cultural revolution, conducted open rectification, and repeatedly analyzed the situation. They realized that after the basic victory in the power seizure struggle, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionaries, the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party remained the principal contradiction. Launching a comprehensive offensive and struggle against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, thoroughly overthrowing, defeating, and exposing them, gradually completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, was the direction of the struggle. Based on this analysis, under the leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, various revolutionary mass organizations united to launch a comprehensive offensive and struggle against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Municipal Committee and their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev.

The comprehensive offensive and struggle launched by the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries is a good example of combining revolutionary criticism with local struggle, criticism, and reform within a provincial and municipal scope. It provides good experience for the proletarian revolutionaries on how to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle after achieving basic victory in the power seizure struggle, advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Three prominent features of this comprehensive offensive and struggle

Fully mobilizing and relying on the broad masses of people and cadres to launch a powerful mass criticism is the most prominent feature of this comprehensive offensive and struggle. The struggle meetings were convened by all revolutionary mass organizations in the city. Those who exposed, accused, and criticized the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party and their backer at the meeting included not only representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations and famous labor models and advanced workers, but also leading cadres at the bureau level and above in the entire city (including members of the old Municipal Committee Secretariat). The live broadcast of each struggle meeting was transmitted via television to all factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, and troops in the city. Outside the venue, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres participated in the accusation and denunciation through a large number of phone calls, letters, and big-character posters. Before and after each meeting, various systems, departments, and relevant units also held a series of meetings to struggle against the capitalist-roaders within their own departments and units, in response to the city-wide struggle meeting. Thus, the meeting promoted the small meetings, the small meetings enriched the meeting, and the upper and lower levels communicated, supplemented, and promoted each other, making the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party and their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, completely submerged in the vast ocean of the people's movement.

The content of the struggle closely followed the latest instructions from the Party Central Committee, always focusing on the key points of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, and closely combining with the struggle situation in the country and the city at that time, is another prominent feature of this comprehensive offensive and struggle. The first round of the struggle systematically exposed the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai in their frenzied anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. After the publication of a series of important articles such as "Patriotism or Treason?" in the Red Flag magazine in early April, which sounded the charge for a thorough criticism of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, the subsequent struggle meeting focused on exposing and criticizing the relationship between the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party and the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as their malicious attacks on Chairman Mao, opposition to the Three Red Banners, and attacks on Comrade Ke Qingshi, making the revolutionary people of the entire city deeply understand the importance and necessity of this comprehensive offensive and struggle. Soon, the People's Daily published the editorial "Why Must We Focus on Criticizing the 'Strike Down a Large Group and Protect a Small Clique' Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line," and the entire city launched a new wave of criticism. In response to this wave of criticism, a struggle meeting was held to focus on criticizing the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party who actively promoted this reactionary line in the cadre issue. In this way, the struggle in the entire city surged higher and higher, and the criticism went deeper and deeper, continuously advancing the revolutionary criticism.

Emphasizing proletarian politics, placing political and ideological work in the forefront, correctly handling the two types of contradictions, insisting on struggle through persuasion, and firmly believing in the power of Mao Zedong Thought to defeat and subdue the enemy, is the third prominent feature of this comprehensive offensive and struggle. In this struggle, the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "controlling ideological education is the central link in uniting the entire Party to wage a great political struggle," used the great Mao Zedong Thought to educate and help leading cadres who had made different degrees of mistakes. They organized them to study Chairman Mao's works, the Red Flag magazine, and the People's Daily's series of important articles, and conveyed Chairman Mao's relevant instructions to them; let them go to the masses, participate in various exposure and criticism meetings and discussions, accept the masses' criticism and help, help them recognize and correct their mistakes, put down their burdens, and march forward lightly, jointly fighting against the enemy. For the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in various departments, they insisted on persuasion and struggle, insisted on struggle through persuasion, allowed them to make statements and expose themselves at the struggle meeting, and gave them the opportunity to redeem themselves and reform. Even for the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Municipal Committee, they were allowed to speak at the meeting, letting them fully play the role of "negative teachers."

The comprehensive offensive and struggle has become the main task of all work in Shanghai

The comprehensive offensive and struggle against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party and their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, has become the center of Shanghai's political life in recent months and the main task of all current work in Shanghai. The revolutionary masses in Shanghai have vividly compared the relationship between this revolutionary comprehensive offensive and struggle, revolutionary unity, and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" with the relationship between the axle and the wheel: the axle turns, the wheel rolls forward. The huge effect shown by this comprehensive offensive and struggle is:

First, it thoroughly exposed the ugly faces of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and his agents in Shanghai. This comprehensive offensive and struggle fully, systematically, and deeply exposed the cover of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee, further exposing the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line through his agents in Shanghai, attempting to turn Shanghai into an important base for the restoration of capitalism. They frenziedly attacked our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his good student Comrade Ke Qingshi, opposed the masses' active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, defamed Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle, advocated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, maliciously attacked the Three Red Banners, and practiced class surrender and national surrenderism. After Comrade Ke Qingshi's death, they fully promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, recruited traitors, formed cliques, and attempted to restore capitalism. In this proletarian cultural revolution, they blocked Chairman Mao's voice on one hand and used Comrade Ke Qingshi's prestige among the masses to cover up their own faces on the other, spreading lies such as "the Shanghai Municipal Committee is revolutionary and correct"; they even shamelessly attributed Chairman Mao's personal leadership of the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" and the "Three Family Village" in Shanghai to their own merits, appropriating the heavens' achievements for themselves, deceiving the broad cadres, and practicing bourgeois dictatorship. Through one exposure and criticism after another on a city-wide scale, the ugly faces of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Municipal Committee and their backer have been completely exposed in broad daylight, and this handful of people have truly become "rats crossing the street" that everyone wants to beat, completely submerged in the vast ocean of the revolutionary mass movement. Through the criticism, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres received an unprecedented profound education on the reality of class struggle. They hated the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party even more, loved Chairman Mao even more; the clearer they saw the counter-revolutionary nature of the bourgeois reactionary line, the more they supported Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Thus, a mass wave of comprehensive offensive and struggle quickly emerged in Shanghai, calling for "arousing thousands and tens of thousands of workers and peasants" and "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat."

Second, liberating a large group and striking down a small clique. This comprehensive offensive and struggle, by concentrating on exposing and cleansing the crimes and poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique" in the cadre issue, made the revolutionary masses have a more comprehensive understanding of the basic situation of Shanghai's cadre team, found the root cause of many leading cadres' mistakes and sufferings, and thus more resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, daring to liberate a large group and strike down a small clique. The countless facts exposed in the comprehensive offensive and struggle indicated that many leading cadres (especially grassroots cadres) made mistakes for a reason. The "reason" was the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Municipal Committee, and the "root" was the Chinese Khrushchev. Because the comprehensive offensive and struggle clarified the origins, many revolutionary masses said, "The culprit is the Chinese Khrushchev!" "Leading cadres who made mistakes should just correct them!" In this way, more and more leading cadres in Shanghai, after being educated and helped by the revolutionaries and participating in the comprehensive offensive and struggle, began to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and at the same time draw a clear line with their own mistakes. They went to the masses to deeply examine their mistakes, actively approached the proletarian revolutionaries, and were "liberated." Many cadres were also absorbed into various levels of revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading organs. Among them were many department and bureau-level leading cadres, as well as revolutionary leading cadres from the old Municipal Committee Secretariat, standing committee members, and alternate members.

Third, promoting revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination." In this comprehensive offensive and struggle, by thoroughly exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, it further promoted revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The proletarian revolutionaries said: We used to think that those conservatives who always oppressed and caused trouble for us were too bad, but now it seems that they were all bad ideas from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In the face of a great enemy, as long as the masses who were deceived and participated in the conservative organizations recognize and correct their mistakes, we have no reason not to unite with them to fight. The proletarian revolutionaries followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat be finally liberated, and according to the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to resolve internal contradictions among the people, carried out in-depth and detailed political and ideological work on the masses who were deceived and participated in the conservative organizations. The masses who originally participated in the conservative organizations also deeply felt from the struggle that they had been wrong in the past, and thus changed their stance, returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fought side by side with the revolutionaries to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The proletarian revolutionary organizations that originally held different opinions, in this comprehensive offensive and struggle, aimed their arrows at the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Party and their backer, and were more united in the common struggle. In the city-wide comprehensive offensive and struggle process, Shanghai has already implemented revolutionary unity in a large number of schools, factories, shops, institutions, and scientific research units, and many units have established revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organs under the conditions of maturity.

Fourth, creating conditions for the struggle, criticism, and reform in various units. This comprehensive offensive and struggle, by fully, systematically, and deeply exposing the cover of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee, created good conditions for the struggle, criticism, and reform in various departments and units. Because the problems of the old Municipal Committee were clarified in the comprehensive offensive and struggle, the problems in various departments and units became clearer. Under the promotion of the city-wide comprehensive offensive and struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries in various systems, departments, and units held exposure and criticism meetings according to their different situations, struggled against the capitalist-roaders within their own departments and units, thoroughly cleansed the poison of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and closely combined the struggle between the two classes and the two lines in their own systems, departments, and units with the struggle in the country and the city. Now, liaison stations for struggle, criticism, and reform have been established in various systems and departments, responsible for leading, organizing, and promoting the struggle, criticism, and reform in their own systems and departments, and many departments have appeared in a new look.

Fifth, promoting production and work. Revolution is the locomotive for the development of productive forces. This comprehensive offensive and struggle has become a powerful driving force for the development of socialist productive forces. The revolutionary army and production army composed in the comprehensive offensive and struggle further cleansed the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, "seizing the revolution and promoting production and work." The broad revolutionary masses were spirited, fighting, and full of vigor. Shanghai's industrial and agricultural production, transportation, finance, trade, and scientific and technological frontlines are beginning to show a new upsurge. The total industrial output value is rising month by month, with a 22% increase in March compared to February, and further growth in production in April and May. Many important industrial products have reached unprecedented high levels. The production command system is gradually improving, cooperation relations are further established, and the revolutionary production order is further established and consolidated. The situation of agricultural production is also good.

Sixth, a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This comprehensive offensive and struggle is a sharp and intense class struggle, a profound ideological revolution, and a great education and popularization movement of Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the entire city, in the process of thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, established Mao Zedong Thought, and upheld Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They used Mao Zedong Thought to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and to seize power from the "self" in their minds. Many units with opposing revolutionary organizations sat on the same bench, used the spirit of rectification to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, clarified the direction of the struggle, clarified the principal contradiction, sought common ground while reserving differences, promoted unity, and threw themselves into the comprehensive offensive and struggle. They followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the struggle, followed the direction of the struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, and achieved continuous victories in the struggle. Now, a more extensive and in-depth mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is rising in the entire city.

Deepening the comprehensive offensive and struggle, consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat

"One should pursue the remaining courage to annihilate the enemy, and should not seek fame by learning from the example of Xiang Yu." The Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries deeply understand that the victory of this comprehensive offensive and struggle is "only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li." They are currently summarizing experiences according to Chairman Mao's teachings. The great historical document formulated under Chairman Mao's leadership - the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao's series of important works and instructions on the cultural revolution, and the June 2, 1967 resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee "Fighting for the Struggle to Strengthen the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," etc., have put forward new combat tasks for the broad proletarian revolutionaries. The Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries are seriously studying, deeply understanding, and resolutely implementing them. They are determined to follow the direction of the struggle indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, continue to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, unite the broad masses, pursue victory, and more comprehensively and deeply carry out the revolutionary comprehensive offensive and struggle movement, thoroughly overthrow, defeat, and expose the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, thoroughly cleanse their poison in various fields and aspects, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in all fields, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

    无产阶级文化大革命在上海市进入新阶段
    革命的大批判推进各条战线的斗批改
    紧跟毛主席最新指示，突出无产阶级政治，放手发动群众，狠狠打击党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他在上海的代理人，促进了革命的大联合和“三结合”，抓革命，促生产，巩固和加强了无产阶级专政
    新华社上海十六日电　本社记者述评：上海无产阶级革命派，在“一月革命”的红色风暴中取得了夺权斗争的重大胜利以后，紧紧抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，继续放手发动群众，把革命的大批判和上海地区的斗、批、改紧紧地结合起来，以大无畏的革命气概，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人，发动了全面的总攻击，展开了声势浩大的大批判、大斗争，有力地推动了革命不断向纵深发展。
    当前，上海无产阶级文化大革命一派大好形势，而且越来越好。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的总决战，已经进入了这样一个新阶段：以革命的大批判为纲，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，促进、巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，推动各条战线上的斗、批、改，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，促使无产阶级革命派真正夺好权、掌好权、用好权。
    革命的大批判和本地区斗批改相结合的良好范例
    上海地区的大批判、大斗争，主要以上海无产阶级革命派联合召开的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底清算旧上海市委内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反革命罪行斗争大会”为中心进行的。在上海市革命委员会领导下，这样的斗争大会从三月以来已经举行了七次。
    上海市革命委员会在“一月革命”风暴中成立以后，面临着新的形势：一方面，旧上海市委虽然被推翻了，但市委内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还需要进一步深入展开。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心于自己的失败，妄图复辟倒算。他们在政治上、组织上被打倒了，但他们和他们的总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫在各方面的流毒还远远没有肃清，他们所推行的一整套反革命修正主义货色，还有着它的社会基础。由于在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的毒害，许多领导干部还没有回到毛主席的革命路线上来。另一方面，已经处于掌权地位的无产阶级革命派，如何掌好权、用好权，也缺少经验，有的同志陷入了具体的事务堆里，有的忘记了斗争的大方向，热中于打无原则的“内战”，等等。摆在上海无产阶级革命派面前的矛盾和任务，真是千头万绪。
    在这样的形势下，斗争的大方向是什么？应该抓什么？怎么抓？上海无产阶级革命派根据毛主席“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习”的教导，认真学习了毛主席对文化大革命的一系列重要指示和有关著作，进行了开门整风，反复分析了形势。他们认识到，夺权斗争取得基本胜利以后，无产阶级革命派、广大革命人民、革命干部同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，仍然是主要矛盾。对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们在上海的代理人展开大批判、大斗争，把他们彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，逐步完成斗、批、改任务，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，这是斗争的大方向。上海无产阶级革命派根据这样的分析，在市革命委员会领导下，各个革命群众组织联合起来，向旧市委内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫展开了大批判、大斗争。
    上海无产阶级革命派展开的这场大批判、大斗争是在一个省市范围内，把革命的大批判和本地区的斗、批、改相结合的一个良好范例。它为无产阶级革命派在取得夺权斗争基本胜利以后，如何紧紧掌握斗争大方向，沿着毛主席的革命路线不断前进，巩固和加强无产阶级专政提供了良好的经验。
    这场大批判大斗争的三个显著特点
    充分发动和依靠广大群众、广大干部，展开声势浩大的群众性的大批判，是这场大批判、大斗争的最显著的特点。斗争大会由全市各革命群众组织联合召开。在大会上对上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台进行揭发、控诉和批判的，不仅有各革命群众组织的代表，著名的劳动模范、先进工作者，还有全市部局级以上的领导干部（包括旧市委书记处成员）。每次斗争大会的实况都通过电视向全市工厂、农村、机关、学校和部队转播。会场外，广大革命群众、革命干部通过大量的电话、信件和大字报，参加控诉和声讨。每次大会前后，各系统、各部门和各有关单位也都紧密结合大会斗争内容，分别举行一系列斗争本部门、本单位走资本主义道路当权派的会议，和全市的斗争大会相呼应。这样，大会促进小会，小会丰富大会，上下贯通，相互补充，相互推动，使上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫完全陷于人民群众的汪洋大海之中。
    斗争内容紧跟党中央的最新指示，始终抓住党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人的要害，紧密结合当时全国和全市的斗争形势，是这场大批判、大斗争的又一个显著特点。斗争的第一个回合，就系统地揭发了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人疯狂反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。四月初，《红旗》杂志发表了《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》等一系列重要文章，吹响了彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的进军号以后，紧接着举行的斗争大会，就着重揭发批判了上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派同中国赫鲁晓夫的关系，以及他们恶毒攻击毛主席、反对三面红旗、围攻柯庆施同志的罪恶，使全市革命人民更加深刻地领会了这场大批判的重要性和必要性。不久，《人民日报》发表了《为什么要着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分》的社论，全市又掀起了新的批判高潮。配合这个批判高潮，举行了一次集中批判上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在干部问题上积极推行这条反动路线的斗争大会。这样，全市的斗争一浪高过一浪，批判一层深入一层，革命的大批判不断向前发展。
    突出无产阶级政治，把政治思想工作放在首位，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，坚持文斗，坚信毛泽东思想的威力足以战胜和制服敌人，是这场大批判、大斗争的第三个显著特点。上海无产阶级革命派在这场斗争中，根据毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，用伟大的毛泽东思想来教育和帮助犯有不同程度错误的领导干部，组织他们学习毛主席著作、《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》的一系列重要文章，向他们传达毛主席有关指示；让他们到群众中去，参加各种揭发批判会、座谈会，接受群众的批判、帮助，帮助他们认识和改正错误，放下包袱，轻装上阵，共同对敌。对各部门的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，也坚持说理斗争，坚持文斗，允许他们在斗争大会上交代和揭发，给予他们将功赎罪、改过自新的机会。即使是旧市委内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，也准许他们在会上说话，让他们充分发挥“反面教员”的作用。
    大批判大斗争成了上海当前一切工作的纲
    对上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫的这场大批判、大斗争，已经成了近几个月来上海政治生活的中心，成了当前上海一切工作的纲。上海革命群众把这场革命的大批判与革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”的关系，与各部门、各单位的斗批改的关系，形象地比喻为轴与轮的关系：轴转轮动，滚滚向前。这种大批判所显示出来的巨大效果是：
    一、彻底暴露了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人的丑恶面貌。这场大批判、大斗争，全面、系统、深刻地揭开了旧上海市委内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，进一步揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫通过他在上海的代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图把上海变为复辟资本主义重要基地的罪恶阴谋。他们疯狂攻击我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志，反对群众活学活用毛主席著作，诋毁毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说，鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，恶毒攻击三面红旗，实行阶级投降和民族投降主义。在柯庆施同志逝世以后，他们更全面推行党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义路线，疯狂地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，招降纳叛、结党营私，妄图实行资本主义复辟。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，他们更一面封锁毛主席的声音，一面利用柯庆施同志生前在群众中的威信往自己脸上贴金，极力散布“上海市委是革命的、正确的”等等谎言；甚至无耻地把毛主席在上海亲自领导的对《海瑞罢官》和“三家村”的批判，算做他们的功劳，贪天之功为己功，欺骗广大干部，实行资产阶级专政。通过一次又一次全市范围的大揭露、大批判，旧市委内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们的总后台的丑恶嘴脸已经完全暴露在光天化日之下，这一小撮人真正成了人人喊打的“过街老鼠”，完全陷入了革命群众运动的汪洋大海之中。通过批判，广大革命群众、革命干部受到了空前深刻的现实阶级斗争教育。他们更加仇恨党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，更加热爱毛主席；越看清了资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质，就越拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。于是，在上海迅速出现了“唤起工农千百万”，“横扫千军如卷席”的群众性大批判高潮。
    二、解放一大片，打击一小撮。这场大批判、大斗争由于集中揭露和肃清了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的罪行和流毒，革命群众对上海的干部队伍基本状况有了更加全面的了解，找到了许多领导干部犯错误、受迫害的总根子，也就更加坚决地执行毛主席的干部政策，勇于解放一大批，敢于打击一小撮。大批判、大斗争中揭发的无数事实表明，许多领导干部（特别是基层干部）犯错误是有来头，有根子的。“来头”就是市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，“根子”就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。因为通过大批判弄清了来龙去脉，许多革命群众说，“罪魁祸首就是中国的赫鲁晓夫?！”“犯错误的领导干部知错即改就好了！”这样，上海越来越多的领导干部经过革命派的教育、帮助，和参加了大批判、大斗争，开始与资产阶级反动路线、上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清了界线，同时与自己的错误划清了界线。他们到群众中去深刻地检查自己的错误，主动靠拢无产阶级革命派，得到了“解放”。许多干部还被吸收参加了各级革命的“三结合”领导机构。其中包括不少部、局级领导干部以及旧市委书记处书记、候补书记、常委等革命领导干部。
    三、推动了革命的大联合、“三结合”。在这场大批判、大斗争中，由于彻底地揭露和批判了资产阶级反动路线，进一步促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。无产阶级革命派说：过去总以为整我们、跟我们闹“别扭”的那些保守派太坏了，现在看来都是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派出的坏主意。大敌当前，只要参加保守派组织的受蒙蔽的群众认识和改正错误，我们没有任何理由不团结他们一起战斗。无产阶级革命派遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己的指示，按照“团结——批评——团结”这个解决人民内部矛盾的方法，对参加过保守组织受蒙蔽的群众展开了深入细致的政治思想工作。原来参加保守派组织的群众，也从斗争中深深感到过去“保”错了，从而转变立场，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，大杀回马枪，和革命派一起革党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命。原来持有不同意见的无产阶级革命派组织，在这场大批判、大斗争中，矛头一致对准上海党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其总后台，在共同的斗争中，更加团结了。在全市性的大批判、大斗争过程中，上海已有一大批学校、工厂、商店、机关、科研单位实行了革命的大联合，许多单位在条件成熟以后进一步建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。
    四、为各单位斗批改创造了条件。这场大批判、大斗争由于全面、系统、深刻地揭开了旧上海市委内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，这样就为各部门、各单位的斗批改创造了良好的条件。因为旧市委的问题在大批判、大斗争中搞清楚了，各部门、各单位的问题也就比较明朗了。在全市规模的大批判、大斗争推动下，各系统、各部门、各单位的无产阶级革命派都根据各自的不同情况，召开揭发批判会，斗争本部门、本单位的走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的流毒，并把本系统、本部门、本单位两个阶级、两条路线的斗争同全国、全市的斗争紧密结合起来。现在全市按系统、按部门已陆续建立了一批斗批改联络站，负责领导、组织和推动本系统、本部门的斗批改，许多部门出现了崭新的面貌。
    五、促生产，促工作。革命是推动生产力发展的火车头。这场大批判、大斗争已成为社会主义生产力发展的强大推动力。在大批判、大斗争中组成的一支浩浩荡荡的革命队伍和生产大军，进一步肃清了反革命经济主义的流毒，“抓革命，促生产，促工作”。广大革命群众精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。上海工农业生产、交通运输、财贸和科学技术等各条战线，正在开始出现一个全面高涨的新形势。工业总产值逐月上升，三月份比二月份增产百分之二十二，四、五月份生产又有了进一步增长。许多重要工业产品的生产，创造了历史上没有过的高水平。生产指挥系统逐步健全，协作关系进一步沟通，革命的生产秩序进一步建立和巩固。农业生产的形势也很好。
    六、活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。这场大批判、大斗争是尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，也是深刻的思想大革命，更是一次毛泽东思想大教育、大普及运动。全市无产阶级革命派、革命群众、革命干部在大破资产阶级反动路线的过程中，大立毛泽东思想，大树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们用毛泽东思想夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，用毛泽东思想夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。许多单位对立的几个革命组织负责人，坐在一条板凳上，用整风精神活学活用毛主席著作，明确斗争大方向，明确主要矛盾，求大同，存小异，促进了大联合，全力投入大批判斗争。他们在斗争中紧跟毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席指引的斗争大方向，取得了斗争的不断胜利。现在，一个更加广泛、更加深入的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动正在全市兴起。
    深入开展大批判、大斗争，巩固和加强无产阶级专政
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”上海无产阶级革命派深深懂得这场大批判、大斗争取得的胜利，“只是万里长征走完了第一步。”他们正在根据毛主席的教导，“不断地总结经验”。毛主席主持制定的伟大历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》、毛主席关于文化大革命的一系列重要著作和指示，以及上海市革命委员会一九六七年六月二日决议《为加强无产阶级专政而斗争》等文件的发表，向广大无产阶级革命派提出了新的战斗任务。上海无产阶级革命派正在认真地学习，深刻地领会，坚决地执行。他们决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席指出的斗争大方向，继续高举革命的批判大旗，团结广大群众，乘胜追击，更加全面地、深入地开展革命的大批判、大斗争运动，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及他们在上海的代理人，彻底肃清他们在各个领域、各个方面的流毒，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，树立毛泽东思想在一切领域里的绝对权威，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
