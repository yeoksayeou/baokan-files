The Soviet revisionist leadership clique's betrayal of the Arab people has been fully exposed, sparking strong indignation and protests from the people of various Arab countries. In recent days, Arab people have taken to the streets in demonstrations, denouncing, "The Soviet revisionists are great traitors! The Soviet revisionists are the biggest accomplices of U.S. imperialism!" In Arab countries, the Soviet revisionists, like U.S. imperialism, have become rats that everyone wants to beat.

This wave of anger has made the gentlemen in Moscow quite embarrassed. To cover up their ugly faces in front of the world, they hastily published a batch of shoddy goods in *Pravda* and *Izvestia*, desperately trying to re-dress themselves as friends of the Arab people.

The Soviet revisionist clique actually boasts that they have given the Arab people "such enormous aid," that they played a "truly exalted role" in the recent Middle East incident, and that their actions are a "model" of internationalism. How disgusting!

The Soviet revisionist clique has done nothing but betrayal, yet they have the audacity to talk about their "aid" to the Arab people, truly shameless. You colluded with U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Israeli aggressors, to strike from within and without when Arab countries were suddenly attacked. Not only did you tie the hands and feet of the Arab people, but you also treacherously stabbed them in the back. Your aid to the enemies of the Arab people is truly enormous. The Arab people are well aware of this. Your self-praise can only provoke their even greater indignation.

As for the Soviet revisionist clique's boasting about their "exalted role" in the Middle East incident, it is equally absurd. The whole world has seen: in this Middle East incident, the "exalted role" was played by the Arab people's brave struggle against aggression, fearless of violence, and the resolute support of the people of various countries for the Arab people, not by you, this small group of hypocrites. You are playing an "exalted role" for U.S. imperialism. You betray the interests of the Arab people, sabotage the Arab national liberation movement, and act as accomplices to U.S. imperialism's aggression.

You shamelessly collude with U.S. imperialism to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, harming the Arab people. Is this your so-called "model" of internationalism? Go to hell! You are a model of traitors and accomplices!

The Soviet revisionist clique's past "aid" to Arab countries was originally not well-intentioned, paid as an investment to achieve their dirty political purposes and reap huge profits. This time, the Soviet revisionist clique's disguise has been exposed, so they apply makeup again and put on a false supporting act to truly betray again. However, the Arab people have not forgotten that the Soviet leader Kosygin, a year ago during his visit to Cairo, pounded his chest and promised: "The Soviet Union possesses all types of weapons to 'defend its friends,'" saying that the Arab people can "always rely on the assistance and support of the Soviet Union." The facts have proven that all your promises, no matter how sweet they sound, are lies.

From this Middle East incident, one can indeed see clearly: the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is like the poisonous snake in Chinese folklore that disguises itself as a beauty. These traitors are full of sores and evil, no matter how beautifully they dress up, they can only find customers among the fat cats in places like Washington. People of all countries will only cover their noses and pass by. Arab public opinion is right: "The new farce performed by the Soviet Union only deepens and adds to our old grudges against the Soviet leaders." The Soviet revisionist clique's tricks can stop now!

    毒蛇装扮不成美女

    苏修领导集团出卖阿拉伯人民的面目大暴露以后，激起了阿拉伯各国人民的强烈愤慨和抗议。这几天来，阿拉伯人民到处示威游行，怒斥
  “苏修是大叛徒！”“苏修是美帝大帮凶！”在阿拉伯各国，苏修和美帝一样，已经成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。
    这一阵愤怒的浪潮，使莫斯科的老爷们颇为难堪。为了在众目睽睽之下掩盖他们的丑恶嘴脸，他们急急忙忙在《真理报》和《消息报》上抛出一批很不象样的货色，竭力想把自己重新打扮成为阿拉伯人民的朋友。
    苏修集团竟然胡吹什么，他们给了阿拉伯各国人民“多么巨大的援助”，他们在这次中东事件中起了“确实是崇高的作用”，他们的行动是“国际主义”的“典范”。真是好不肉麻！
    苏修集团干尽了叛卖的勾当，居然还有脸大谈什么对阿拉伯人民的
  “援助”，实在是不知羞耻为何物。你们同美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略者里应外合，在阿拉伯国家遭到突然袭击的紧急关头，不但拖住了阿拉伯人民的手脚，而且阴险狠毒地在他们背上插了一刀。你们对阿拉伯人民的敌人的“援助”才真正是巨大的。这一点，阿拉伯人民最清楚不过了。你们的自我吹嘘，只能引起他们加倍的愤慨罢了。
    至于苏修集团夸耀自己在中东事件中起了“崇高的作用”，同样是荒唐透顶。全世界人民都看到：在这次中东事件中，起着“崇高的作用”的，是阿拉伯人民不畏强暴、反击侵略的英勇斗争，是各国人民对阿拉伯人民的坚决支持，而决不是你们这一小撮口蜜腹剑的家伙。你们是在对美帝国主义起“崇高的作用”，你们出卖阿拉伯人民的利益，破坏阿拉伯民族解放运动，充当了美帝国主义侵略的同谋者。
    你们这样无耻地同美帝国主义合伙大搞反革命勾当，陷害阿拉伯人民，难道这就是你们所谓的“国际主义”的“典范”吗？见你们的鬼去吧，你们是十足的叛徒的“典范”，帮凶的“典范”！
    苏修集团过去对阿拉伯国家的“援助”，本来就是不怀好意的，为了实现他们肮脏的政治目的而付出一笔谋取暴利的投资。这一次，苏修集团的伪装被揭穿了，于是又重施脂粉，再作一副假支持的姿态，以便再干真出卖的勾当。但是，阿拉伯人民并没有忘记，苏修头目柯西金一年之前在访问开罗时，曾拍过胸脯保证：苏联“拥有一切类型的武器”来“捍卫自己的朋友”，说什么阿拉伯人民“永远可以指望苏联的协助和支持”。事实证明，你们的一切诺言，不管说得多么好听，都是骗人的谎话。
    从这次中东事件中，人们确实可以看得清楚：苏修领导集团这一帮家伙，正象中国民间传说中所讲的，是一条化成美女的毒蛇。这些叛徒们是满身脓疮、五毒俱全的害人精，任凭怎样打扮得花枝招展，也只能在华盛顿那些地方的大腹便便的老板中找到顾客，各国人民只会掩鼻而过。阿拉伯舆论说得好：“苏联演的新的滑稽戏只有助于加深和增添我们对苏联领导人的旧仇。”苏修集团的鬼把戏，可以休矣！
