What is the United Nations?

The recent Middle East incident has made it clearer to the people of the world that the United Nations is completely a tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression, a tool for U.S.-Soviet collaboration in suppressing national liberation movements, and a tool for great power politics.

This time, the war of aggression launched by Israel against Arab countries was ignited by U.S. imperialism. The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to push its nefarious plans of neo-colonialism in the Middle East. U.S. imperialism not only directed Israel to launch the aggression but also participated in the aggression itself. However, did the United Nations condemn Israel? No. Did the United Nations condemn U.S. imperialism? Even more so, no.

When Israel was ready to strike, with arrows on the string and ready to shoot, the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant did not rush to Tel Aviv to restrain Israel's actions but hurried to Cairo to "advise" the Arab countries to "exercise restraint." Was this not clearly creating a smoke screen for Israel's sudden attack?

After Israel launched a surprise attack on the Arab countries, the United Nations did not take any measures to stop Israel's aggression but instead hastily issued an "immediate ceasefire" order. Was this not clearly intended to obstruct the Arab countries' self-defense counterattacks?

After the Israeli aggressor forces occupied large tracts of Arab land, the United Nations again threw out the so-called "ceasefire within a deadline" resolution proposed by the Soviet revisionists. Was this not clearly intended to provide cover for the U.S.-Israeli aggressors and, in effect, acknowledge Israel's expansion?

The facts are clear: the actions of the United Nations are all carried out under the command of U.S. imperialism and with the participation of the Soviet revisionists. It completely adapts to the needs of U.S. imperialism and faithfully serves U.S. imperialism. The U.S. propaganda machine couldn't help but shout that the United Nations' passage of the "ceasefire" resolution was "a great victory for U.S. diplomacy." This is a clear admission that the United Nations is an unmistakable tool of U.S. imperialism's neo-colonialist aggression.

U.S. imperialism uses the United Nations to push its aggressive policies, always with the strong support of the Soviet revisionist leadership. It was like this in the past, and it is even more so this time. The heads of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, through secret consultations and "hotline" communications, had long reached a tacit understanding. Then, they acted in tandem, singing a duet, and jointly used the United Nations to suppress the just struggle of the Arab people. Their actions were so coordinated, and their collaboration was so tight. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are increasingly brazenly turning the United Nations into their counter-revolutionary trading post.

The United Nations has always been manipulated by the great powers, and this time the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and a few other great powers played "great power politics" in the United Nations, particularly blatantly. They colluded with each other, acted in concert, and engaged in backroom deals. On the surface, they pretended to be impartial, but in reality, they acted despicably. All their actions were aimed at interfering with and dominating the entire Arab world through the United Nations. The national independence, territorial integrity, and self-defense rights of the Arab countries were all ignored by them. Everything had to be decided by them. Once they agreed on a deal among themselves, wrote it into a document, and stamped it with the United Nations' seal, it became a controlling spell for other countries. They allowed themselves to oppress but did not allow others to resist. They are a gang of bullies on the international political stage, and the United Nations is merely their division of spoils.

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The imperialist wolves should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily dispose of the fate of mankind and arbitrarily slaughter the Asian and African countries has passed and will not return." Can the fate of 100 million Arab people be allowed to be manipulated by these bullies in the United Nations conference hall? Can the vast Arab world be allowed to be dominated by these few great powers? No, absolutely not. The Arab world belongs only to the Arab people. The fate of the Arab people can only be grasped by the Arab people themselves. Whoever tries to bully the Arab people with their so-called "great power" will inevitably fall and suffer a crushing defeat. The storm of the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle will surely sweep these imperialist and revisionist bullies into the dustbin of history!

    从中东事件看联合国反动本质
    本报评论员
    联合国是个什么东西？
    全世界人民从最近的中东事件中更清楚地看到：联合国完全是美帝国主义的侵略工具，是美苏合作镇压民族解放运动的工具，是大国强权政治的工具。
    这一次以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的战火，是美帝国主义一手点燃起来的。美帝国主义的目的就是要在中东推行其新殖民主义的罪恶计划。美帝国主义不仅指使以色列发动了侵略，而且它自己还参加了侵略行动。但是，联合国谴责过以色列没有呢？没有。联合国谴责过美帝国主义没有呢？更没有。
    当以色列蠢蠢欲动，箭在弦上，势在必发的时候，联合国秘书长吴丹并不是跑到特拉维夫去约束以色列的行动，而是赶往开罗去“劝告”阿拉伯国家“克制”。这不分明是在为以色列的突然袭击制造烟幕吗？
    当以色列向阿拉伯国家进行突然袭击以后，联合国不但没有采取任何措施制止以色列的侵略，却反而急急忙忙地下了一道“立即停火”令，这不分明是要阻挡阿拉伯国家的自卫反击吗？
    当以色列侵略军侵占了阿拉伯国家大片领土之后，联合国又抛出苏修的所谓“限期停火”的决议，这不分明是要给美以侵略者打掩护，并且等于承认以色列的扩张吗？
    事情很明白，联合国的所作所为，都是在美帝的指挥下，苏修参予下，干出来的。它完全适应美帝国主义的需要，忠实地为美帝国主义服务。美国的宣传机器情不自禁地大叫联合国通过“停火”决议是“美国外交上的一大胜利”，这正是不打自招地证明，联合国不折不扣是美帝国主义推行新殖民主义的侵略工具。
    美帝国主义利用联合国来推行它的侵略政策，总是得到苏修领导集团的大力支持的。过去是这样，这一次更是这样。美帝和苏修的头目，密室磋商，“热线”通话，早就达成了默契，然后就一搭一档，大唱双簧，共同利用联合国来镇压阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。它们的举动何其协调，它们的配合何其紧密。美帝苏修越来越明目张胆地把联合国变成为它们反革命的交易所了。
    联合国从来就是受大国操纵的，而美苏英等几个大国这一次在联合国中玩弄“强权政治”尤其露骨。它们相互勾结，串通一气，大搞幕后交易，左一个声明，右一个决议，表面上装得公正，实际上干得卑鄙。它们的一切行动，无非是企图通过联合国来干涉和主宰整个阿拉伯世界。阿拉伯国家的什么民族独立，什么领土完整，什么自卫权利，它们是统统都不放在眼里的，一切都得由它们说了算。它们几家交易谈妥，写成文书，盖上联合国的戳子，就成了控制别国的紧箍咒。只许它们压迫，不许别国反抗。它们是国际政治舞台上的一帮大恶霸，联合国不过是它们的分赃场所。
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”一亿阿拉伯人民的命运，难道能允许这些大恶霸们在联合国的会议厅中摆布吗？广大的阿拉伯世界，难道能允许让这几个大国主宰吗？不，绝对不能。阿拉伯世界只能属于阿拉伯人民。阿拉伯人民的命运，只能由阿拉伯人民来掌握。谁要想仗着它的所谓“大国”权势，欺压阿拉伯人民，它就必然要摔得头破血流。阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的风暴，一定会把这些帝国主义、修正主义大恶霸们扫进历史的垃圾堆！
