Xiao Jin has been an apprentice under Master Qiu for over a year. Some of the apprentices who entered the factory with her formed the "Jihong" Combat Group and sided with the revolutionary faction. When Xiao Jin requested to join, the group members told her, "If you want to join the combat group, you must also win over your master." Xiao Jin thought this made sense and began working to win over Master Qiu.

Master Qiu, whose full name is Qiu Guomin, is an old worker in the machine repair workshop, a member of the Communist Party, and the foreman of the machine repair class. He is also the squad leader of the factory's conservative organization, the Workers' Militia. He is an influential figure in the factory and has been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line. Some people even wanted to use him to deceive more workers.

One day at work, Xiao Jin saw her master wearing the "Workers' Militia" armband and bluntly asked, "Master, people say the Workers' Militia is a conservative organization. Why did you join such an organization?"

Master Qiu found this offensive and gave her a stern look, saying, "What do you know? I've crossed more bridges than you've walked paths!" Xiao Jin hit a snag and thought of another way, teaching her master to sing the "Rebellion Song." However, after copying the lyrics and hanging them on the wall, Master Qiu refused to learn. Xiao Jin kept singing it to him, but he got annoyed and scolded her. Xiao Jin also got angry and left. She went to the "Jihong" Combat Group members and said, "I won't work with Master Qiu anymore." They encouraged Xiao Jin, saying, "We revolutionaries must fight alongside the world's proletariat. Master Qiu is also a class brother. How can you not work with him?" Xiao Jin thought about it and realized that Chairman Mao teaches us to unite the majority and liberate all humanity. If she couldn't even unite her own master, how could she call herself a revolutionary?

From then on, Xiao Jin changed her approach. Seeing that Master Qiu liked to read Chairman Mao's books, she selected relevant quotations from Chairman Mao's works to read to him, focusing on his current thoughts. The most frequently read quotation was: "Communist Party members must question the why of everything, think it through carefully, and consider whether it is practical and reasonable. They must never blindly follow and never advocate slavishness."

These quotations stirred Master Qiu's thoughts, and he began to reflect on his participation in the Workers' Militia.

Master Qiu's thoughts were in turmoil, and the revolutionary faction continued to work on him. Soon, the revolutionary faction established a temporary presidium for criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and invited him, as an old worker, to sit on the stage as a non-voting representative. He felt that the revolutionary faction's attitude was broad-minded and was deeply moved. During the meeting, the shocking facts about the bourgeois reactionary line exposed made a great impact on him, helping him realize his mistakes in the struggle between the two lines. However, during the meeting, members of his squad in the Workers' Militia tried every means to disrupt the proceedings and forcibly pulled him off the stage. Through this struggle, he recognized the true nature of the "Workers' Militia." Finally, he resolutely convened a meeting of the "Workers' Militia" committee and announced in front of everyone, "The overall direction of the Workers' Militia is wrong," and led the way in withdrawing from the militia.

The next day, big-character posters and congratulatory letters supporting Master Qiu's revolutionary actions covered the walls.

Soon, Xiao Jin and Master Qiu both joined the revolutionary faction organization—the Mao Zedong Thought Combat Team.

    一个老工人的觉醒
    贵州红星拖拉机厂团结大多数的一个侧面
    小金跟邱师傅当学徒一年多了。和她一起进厂的部分学徒工，组织了
  “继红”战斗组，小金早就站到革命派一边。当她要求参加时，战斗组的同志们对小金说：“你要参加战斗组，也要把你师傅争取过来。”小金听了觉得有理，于是就着手做争取团结邱师傅的工作。
    邱师傅叫邱国民，是机修车间的老工人、共产党员、机工班长，又是厂里的保守组织工人纠察队中队长，在厂里是个有影响的人物。他自己受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，有人还想利用他蒙蔽更多的工人。
    有一天上班，小金看见师傅戴上了“纠察队”的袖章，便直截了当地对邱师傅说：“师傅，人家都说工人纠察队是纠察工人队，是保守组织，你为什么加入这样的组织？”
    邱师傅听得不入耳，白了她一眼，说：“你懂啥？我过的桥比你走的路还多！”小金碰了钉子，又想了个办法，教师傅唱《造反歌》。哪晓得，抄好了歌子挂到墙上，邱师傅硬是不肯学。小金就一个劲地唱给他听，他听烦了，还向小金发脾气，小金也生了气，扭头走了。她找到“继红”战斗组的同志说：“我不跟邱师傅干了。”他们鼓励小金说：“我们革命派要跟全世界无产阶级一块干革命，邱师傅也是阶级兄弟，你怎么能不跟他干了呢？”小金一想也对，毛主席教导我们，要团结大多数，解放全人类，我连自己的师傅都团结不过来，还算什么革命派。
    从此，小金改变了方式。她看到邱师傅爱读毛主席的书，就针对他的活思想选一些毛主席语录念给他听。念得最多的一条是：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”
    这些语录，使邱师傅在思想上有所触动，他在思索着自己参加工人纠察队的问题。
    邱师傅的思想在斗争着，革命派在继续对他做工作。不久，革命派成立了批判资产阶级反动路线临时大会主席团，革命派邀请他以老工人的资格当列席代表坐在主席台上。对这件事，他觉得革命派的胸怀就是宽阔，很受感动。会上，揭露出来的资产阶级反动路线的惊心动魄的事实，对他触动很大，使他对自己在两条路线斗争中的错误更有所认识。而就在会议进行中间，他那个中队的工人纠察队员，却千方百计捣乱会场，硬把他从主席台上拖下来。通过这场斗争，使他认清了“工人纠察队”的性质。最后，他毅然决然地召开了“工人纠察队”队委会，在会上当众宣布：“工人纠察队的大方向就是错误的”，并带头退出纠察队。
    第二天，革命派支持邱师傅革命行动的大字报、祝贺信贴得满墙都是。
    不久，小金和邱师傅一起参加了革命派组织——毛泽东思想战斗队。
