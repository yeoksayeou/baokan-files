	Khrushchev Personally Handles Deals as He Sneaks to the United States

	New York, June 18 (Xinhua) — Soviet revisionist leader Alexei Kosygin arrived in New York on June 17 to conspire with U.S. imperialist leader Lyndon Johnson on a comprehensive collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He also aims to further utilize the United Nations to serve the global counter-revolutionary deal between the two superpowers.

	After the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the Arab people was exposed, they hypocritically demanded that the United Nations convene an emergency meeting to discuss Israel's aggression against Arab countries. Kosygin is traveling to the United States under the pretext of attending this emergency session of the UN General Assembly.

	Kosygin's trip to the United States serves two main purposes: first, to make some gestures of "supporting" Arab countries and "condemning" Israeli aggression at the UN meeting to deflect the strong condemnation from the Arab people and the world against the Soviet revisionists as the U.S. imperialists' accomplices; second, and more importantly, to use this opportunity to directly negotiate a global counter-revolutionary deal with the Johnson administration.

	So far, neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union has officially announced the details of the Johnson-Kosygin talks. Both leaders have been evasive and secretive about the matter. However, high-level officials from both countries have been busy preparing for the talks. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Earle Wheeler, who were scheduled to depart for South Vietnam on June 18, have postponed their trip to participate in the talks with Kosygin. Western newspapers and news agencies, citing official sources from the U.S. and the Soviet Union, reported that the talks will cover not only the Middle East issue but also further strengthening U.S.-Soviet collusion, continuing to make deals on disarmament, and conspiring against Vietnam and China.

	It is worth noting that there are reports suggesting that Kosygin intends to use his trip to the United States to plot a new "bombing halt and enticement" scheme with Johnson in the Vietnam issue. On June 17, the British "Observer" correspondent in Washington, Hedrick Smith, reported: "It is expected that Kosygin will strongly advocate for a comprehensive peace agreement, which, in addition to resolving the Middle East situation, at least includes the U.S. decision to stop bombing North Vietnam." On the same day, Reuters quoted a "well-informed Communist source" in Hungary as saying that Kosygin will "strongly demand a peaceful resolution in the Middle East and Vietnam" during the talks, and "there may now be negotiations to ask Johnson to stop bombing North Vietnam to create a better atmosphere for reaching an agreement on the Arab-Israeli situation." Meanwhile, the United Press International reported that the Johnson administration is "considering stopping the bombing of North Vietnam again before formally sending more U.S. troops to participate in the Vietnam War" to "remove obstacles" for its future expansion of the war.

	After arriving in New York, Kosygin met with UN Secretary-General U Thant and attended the opening ceremony of the emergency session of the UN General Assembly. At the meeting, U.S. representative Arthur Goldberg welcomed Kosygin and publicly praised Kosygin's remarks made during his stopover in Paris about hoping for a "peaceful resolution" to the issue of Israel's aggression against Arab countries. Goldberg expressed that the United States is willing to "jointly resolve the Middle East issue" with the Soviet Union.

    亲自出马做交易
    柯西金鬼头鬼脑到美国
    新华社十八日讯　纽约消息：苏修头目柯西金十七日到达纽约，以便同美帝国主义头目约翰逊策划美苏全面勾结，并进一步利用联合国来为美苏全球性的反革命大交易服务。
    苏修领导集团在它叛卖阿拉伯人民的面目大暴露之后，装模作样地要求联合国召开紧急会议，说什么要讨论以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的问题。柯西金就是在出席联大紧急会议的名义下到美国去的。
    柯西金这次美国之行，一方面是企图在联合国会议上作一些“支持”阿拉伯国家、“谴责”以色列侵略的姿态，借以平息阿拉伯和世界人民对苏修这个美帝帮凶的强烈谴责；而更重要的则是利用这个机会同约翰逊政府直接进行全球性的反革命大交易。
    到目前为止，美苏官方都还没有正式宣布有关约翰逊—柯西金会谈的问题，他们本人也都躲躲闪闪，秘而不宣，但是，两国高级官员已经在为这次会谈进行紧张的准备。据美国国防部宣布，原定十八日动身前往南越的美国国防部长麦克纳马拉和参谋长联席会议主席惠勒，已经推迟了他们的南越之行，以便参加同柯西金的会谈。西方报刊、通讯社引用美苏官方人士透露出来的消息说，他们在会谈中除了要讨论中东问题之外，还要商谈关于进一步加强美苏勾结、继续在裁军问题上作交易，特别是共谋对付越南和反华等问题。
    值得注意的是，有消息说，柯西金企图利用他的这次美国之行，伙同约翰逊在越南问题上策划一次新的“停炸诱降”阴谋。英国《观察家报》驻华盛顿记者赫德十七日报道说：“预料柯西金将力促达成一个一揽子和平的协议，就是在中东的解决之外，至少加上美国停止轰炸北越的决定。”同一天，路透社引用匈牙利“消息灵通的共产党人士”的话说，柯西金在会谈中将“极力要求在中东和越南实行和平的解决”，“可能现在会进行一次交涉，要求约翰逊停止轰炸北越，为就阿拉伯—以色列局势达成协议而制造一种更好的气氛”。同时，合众国际社在一条消息中透露，约翰逊政府也“正在考虑在正式增派美军参加越南战争以前，再次停止轰炸北越”，以便为它今后进一步扩大战争“扫除障碍”。
    柯西金在到达纽约后，就去联合国会见了联合国秘书长吴丹，并参加了联大紧急会议的开幕式。会上，美国代表戈德堡对柯西金表示欢迎，并当面夸奖了柯西金在途经巴黎时发表的关于希望“和平解决”以色列侵略阿拉伯国家问题的谈话。他表示，美国愿意和苏联“共同来解决中东问题”。
