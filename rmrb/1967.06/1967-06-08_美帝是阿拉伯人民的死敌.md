A fierce anti-American storm has risen in West Asia and Africa.

The military and civilians of the Arab countries are bravely counterattacking the armed invasion by U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel. At the same time, the people of various Arab countries are holding massive anti-American demonstrations. Shouts of "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Down with Johnson!" echo across the Arab lands. The governments of the United Arab Republic, Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Sudan, Yemen, and other countries have successively announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the United States. This is a major step taken by the Arab countries to oppose the invasion by U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel. The Arab people and Arab countries have directed the spearhead of their anti-invasion struggle directly at U.S. imperialism. They are right! They are doing well!

The war of aggression by Israel against the Arab countries is one orchestrated by U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit of this war of aggression. Israel is merely a watchdog raised by the United States in the Middle East. Without the orders of the United States, Israel would not dare and could not launch such a large-scale armed attack on the Arab countries. Now, U.S. imperialism has taken to the battlefield, collaborating with British imperialism, and sending its air force to directly participate in Israel's war of aggression. This has fully exposed its face as the instigator of aggression.

U.S. imperialism is the root cause of modern wars. The policy of aggression and war by U.S. imperialism has led to various wars in the world today. However, wars educate the people and temper the people. It usually takes a long time to distinguish friends from enemies. Once a war breaks out, it can be clear in a few days. In this anti-invasion war, the Arab people quickly saw the true nature of U.S. imperialism and recognized it as the number one enemy. The faces of British imperialism and Soviet revisionism were also quickly exposed.

Now, U.S. imperialism is actively supporting and assisting Israel in attacking Arab countries, while at the same time conspiring with British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to concoct a so-called "ceasefire resolution" in the United Nations. This is a very vicious counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. Its purpose is not only to cover up the crimes of aggression by U.S. imperialism but also to use the United Nations as a tool of aggression to exert pressure on the Arab countries, forcing the Arab people to surrender. Isn't U.S. imperialism pushing things too far?

U.S. imperialism has ignited the flames of aggression in the Middle East but "urges" the Arab countries to "ceasefire." U.S. imperialism directed Israel to launch an armed invasion and even participated in this war of aggression, but it wants to stop the Arab people from self-defense and counterattack. Where in the world is there such logic? U.S. imperialism wants to use a piece of paper from the United Nations to bind the hands of the Arab people in their anti-invasion struggle, to extinguish the anti-imperialist fury of the Arab people, which is absolutely impossible.

The Arab nation is a great nation, and the Arab people are heroic. They are not to be bullied. The mighty force of a united billion Arab people is invincible. With the support of the people of the whole world, as long as the Arab people further mobilize, strengthen unity, and persist in the anti-invasion war, they will definitely be able to smash the armed invasion by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and achieve a great victory.

    美帝是阿拉伯人民的死敌
    本报评论员
    一场猛烈的反美风暴已经在西亚非洲兴起。
    阿拉伯各国军民正在英勇反击美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的武装侵略。与此同时，阿拉伯各国人民纷纷举行强大的反美示威。“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒约翰逊！”的怒吼声，响彻了阿拉伯的大地。阿联、叙利亚、伊拉克、阿尔及利亚、苏丹、也门等国政府已先后宣布同美国断绝外交关系。这是阿拉伯国家为反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略而采取的重大步骤。阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯国家把反侵略斗争的矛头直接指向美帝国主义，他们干得对！干得好！
    以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的战争，是美帝国主义一手制造的。美帝国主义是这场侵略战争的罪魁祸首。以色列不过是美国在中东豢养的一条警犬。没有美国的号令，以色列就不敢也不可能对阿拉伯国家发动这样大规模的武装进攻。现在，美帝国主义赤膊上阵，伙同英帝国主义，派遣空军直接参与以色列的侵略战争。这就把它这个侵略元凶的面目完全暴露无遗。
    美帝国主义是现代战争的根源。美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，导致了当前世界上各式各样的战争。但是，战争教育了人民，锻炼了人民。平常要很长时间才能分清谁是自己的朋友，谁是自己的敌人。一旦战争爆发，几天的时间，就可以分清楚了。在这场反侵略战争中，阿拉伯人民很快地看到了美帝国主义的本质，认识了美帝国主义是头号敌人。英帝国主义和苏联修正主义的面目也很快就暴露了。
    现在，美帝国主义一方面积极支持和帮助以色列进攻阿拉伯国家，同时又和英帝国主义和苏修领导集团合谋，在联合国中炮制出一项所谓“停火决议”。这是一种十分毒辣的反革命两手策略，它的目的不仅是要借此掩饰美帝国主义的侵略罪行，而且是要利用联合国这个侵略工具，向阿拉伯国家施加压力，迫使阿拉伯人民屈膝投降。美帝国主义岂不是欺人太甚了吗？
    美帝国主义在中东地区点起了侵略战火，却“呼吁”阿拉伯国家“停火”。美帝国主义指使以色列发动了武装侵略，并且参加了这场侵略战争，却要阻止阿拉伯人民进行自卫反击。天下哪里有这样的道理？美帝国主义想用联合国的一纸具文，来束缚阿拉伯人民反侵略的手脚，来扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝怒火，这是绝对办不到的。
    阿拉伯民族是伟大的民族，阿拉伯人民是英雄的人民。他们决不是好欺负的。一亿阿拉伯人民团结起来的强大力量是不可战胜的。在全世界人民的支持下，只要阿拉伯人民进一步动员起来，加强团结，坚持反侵略战争，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略，取得伟大的胜利。
