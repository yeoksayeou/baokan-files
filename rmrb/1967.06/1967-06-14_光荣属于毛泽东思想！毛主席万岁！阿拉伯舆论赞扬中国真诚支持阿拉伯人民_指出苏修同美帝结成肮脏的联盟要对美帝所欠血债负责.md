According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, Arab public opinion on the 12th continued to enthusiastically praise China's sincere support for the Arab people's anti-aggression war and strongly condemn the treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

The Sudan-China Friendship Association sent a telegram to the China-Africa People's Friendship Association on the 12th, celebrating the Chinese people's support for the Arab people's just struggle against American-Israeli aggression. The telegram said: "We celebrate the Chinese people's support for the Arab people's patriotic cause against American-Israeli imperialism. The treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionists should be condemned. Glory to Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Iraqi newspapers *Al-Jumhuriya* and *Al-Majalla* both published on the 12th the editorial from *People's Daily* on the 11th: "Arab People, Unite and Fight On, Struggle to the End with Imperialism!" *Al-Jumhuriya* used Chairman Mao's quotation as a headline: "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people."

The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Ayyam* on the 12th enthusiastically praised China's support for the Arab people's just struggle, saying: "China actively accepts the challenge of countries that carry out evil aggression against the Arabs." The newspaper pointed out that in this struggle, the Soviet Union's mask has been torn off, revealing its true face, and China has extended its hand to the Arab countries.

The newspaper said, "The Soviet Union instigated the American attack, and it is astonishing to hear the Soviet government declare that they are peace-loving when blood is flowing everywhere."

The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Akhbar* said, "We are very proud to have the support of China and other countries and peoples who stand with us, because this is a friendship shown in difficult times."

The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Mithaq* on the 12th expressed indignation at the Soviet revisionists' trick of breaking off relations with Israel after betraying the Arab people. The newspaper said, "The purpose of the Soviet leaders' action is to 'cover up their historic betrayal.' It said: 'The Soviet Union's new farce can only deepen our hatred for the Soviet leaders,' 'The Soviet leaders, like their American allies, are also responsible for the blood debt they owe to the Arab countries.'"

The UAR newspaper *Al-Ahram* on the 12th condemned American imperialism for providing hundreds of aircraft and various weapons to Israel to launch armed aggression against the Arab people, and accused the Soviet revisionist ruling clique of colluding with American and British imperialism to fabricate the United Nations' "ceasefire resolution."

The Kuwaiti newspaper *Al-Siyasa* on the 12th published a cartoon exposing the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's betrayal of the Arab people, depicting the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin sitting with Johnson, Wilson, and Eshkol, feasting together.

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra* published an editorial on the 12th stating that the Arab people are determined to continue the liberation war until they drive imperialism out of the Arab world.

    指出苏修同美帝结成肮脏的联盟要对美帝所欠血债负责
    据新华社十三日讯　阿拉伯国家公众舆论十二日继续热情赞扬中国对阿拉伯人民反侵略战争的真诚支持，痛斥苏修统治集团的叛卖行为。
    苏丹—中国友好协会十二日打电报给中国—非洲人民友好协会，欢呼中国人民支持阿拉伯人民反对美以侵略的正义斗争。电报说：“我们欢呼中国人民支持阿拉伯反对美—以帝国主义的爱国事业。苏修的叛卖行为应受谴责。光荣属于毛泽东思想。毛主席万岁！”
    伊拉克《共和国报》和《灯塔报》十二日都刊登了《人民日报》十一日的社论：《阿拉伯人民团结起来，再接再厉，同帝国主义斗争到底！》《共和国报》在刊登这篇社论时用毛主席语录做通栏大标题：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”。
    苏丹《新闻日报》十二日热情赞扬中国支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争说：“中国主动地迎接对阿拉伯进行邪恶的侵略的国家的挑战。”这家报纸指出，在这场斗争中，苏联的假面具被撕下，暴露出真面目，中国向阿拉伯国家伸出了手。
    报纸说，苏联怂恿了美国的进攻，“听到苏联政府在血流遍地的时候宣布他们是和平爱好者，这是令人吃惊的。”
    苏丹《最后一分钟报》说，我们对有中国以及其他同我们站在一起的国家和人民的支持表示非常自豪，因为这是在困难的时刻表现出来的友谊。
    苏丹《公约报》十二日对苏修在出卖了阿拉伯人民之后又玩弄与以色列断交的花招表示愤慨。这家报纸说，苏联领导人这样做的目的是企图“掩盖其具有历史性的背叛”。它说：“苏联的这个行动是骗不了人的，人民认清了苏联同美国结成反对阿拉伯人民的肮脏的联盟”。
    报纸说：“苏联和美国的立场没有什么不同，苏联演的新的滑稽戏只能加深我们对苏联领导人的仇恨”，“苏联领导人也同他们的美国盟友一样，要对他们对阿拉伯各国所欠下的血债负责。”
    阿联《消息报》十二日谴责美帝国主义向以色列提供几百架飞机和各种武器向阿拉伯人民发动武装侵略，并指责苏修统治集团伙同美英帝国主义炮制联合国的“停火决议”。
    科威特《舆论报》十二日发表了一幅漫画，揭露苏修统治集团对阿拉伯人民的背叛，漫画中画着苏修统治集团头目柯西金同约翰逊、威尔逊和艾希科尔之流坐在一起大吃大喝。
    叙利亚《革命报》十二日发表社论指出，阿拉伯人民决心继续进行解放战争，直到把帝国主义从阿拉伯赶走。
