The name Lü Xiangbi, this hero, urges people to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!

	Devoting One's Life to the Party

People will never forget the heroic moment of Lü Xiangbi's sacrifice!

It was the afternoon of March 3rd this year. Lü Xiangbi, a soldier from the guard company temporarily assigned to the farm and livestock station of the unit, responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." He eagerly harnessed a gray horse, pulled an iron-plated cart loaded with agricultural tools to be repaired, and arrived at Baota Pu Town.

After repairing the tools, he went to the "August 1st" tractor repair shop and pulled six large gasoline drums, which were to be converted into manure buckets, back to the unit. Just as he was loading the drums onto the cart, the empty drums and the iron-plated cart collided, producing a sharp noise. The gray horse was startled and bolted. At that moment, school was just letting out, and the narrow street was crowded with people and vehicles. If the cart were to charge into the crowd, what would happen! Lü Xiangbi anxiously gripped the reins with both hands, trying to rein in the horse. However, the drums bounced and clanged, and the horse ran faster. Around a sharp bend, Lü Xiangbi was thrown to the ground. The few workers who had helped load the drums saw that Lü Xiangbi was in danger. They rushed after him, shouting, "Let go! Let go!" At that moment, about ten meters ahead, four Red Guards were startled. In just a few seconds, a serious accident would occur! In this critical moment, Lü Xiangbi gritted his teeth, exerted all his strength to tightly grip the reins, and used his body to pull down the horse's head. He pulled one meter, did not let go! He pulled two meters, did not let go! He pulled three meters, still did not let go! He pulled a total of six meters.

In those short six meters, every meter shone with Lü Xiangbi's communist spirit of loving the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary youngsters, and of dedicating his life to the public!

In those short six meters, every meter expressed Lü Xiangbi's boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao! It signified that Lü Xiangbi had established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in his mind, and demonstrated the mighty power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

In those short six meters, every meter was Lü Xiangbi's powerful refutation of the "philosophy of survival" advocated by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road!

Lü Xiangbi risked his life and, with extraordinary willpower, pulled the horse's head down, and down again, ... until he finally pulled the horse's head down to the ground, forcing the gray horse to turn a ninety-degree bend. The horse and cart toppled over into the ditch by the roadside. The horse fell and the cart overturned, saving the four Red Guards, but Lü Xiangbi's head was injured by the cart and he immediately lost consciousness.

Several workers who rushed to the scene quickly lifted Lü Xiangbi to the commune hospital. Lü Xiangbi lay quietly in the emergency room, his lips slightly parted, as if asking, "Are the Red Guards injured?"

The revolutionary masses who witnessed this heroic act of self-sacrifice were deeply moved. Nearby workers, peasants, and students rushed to visit him. Suddenly, the hospital was crowded with more than a thousand people. They all demanded to donate blood for the hero, shouting in unison, "He is a good soldier of Chairman Mao, our Liu Yingjun of Baota Pu, we must save him!" Although the medical staff took the most urgent and effective rescue measures, Lü Xiangbi, the good soldier of Chairman Mao, ultimately sacrificed his life due to his severe injuries. The crowds gathered inside and outside the hospital were reluctant to leave. They said with tears, "Comrade Lü Xiangbi will forever live in our hearts!"

When comrades were sorting through the martyr's belongings, they found a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his blood-stained pocket, a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and a party application written the previous night. On this party application, Lü Xiangbi wrote, "I dedicate my life to the Party's arrangements!"

Lü Xiangbi, with his heroic deed, fulfilled his vow and wrote a glorious page in his history with his blood and life. His sublime thoughts and actions set a shining example for us to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

	With a Heart of Red for the Revolutionary Masses and Revolutionary Youngsters

In the spring of 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The twenty-one-year-old Lü Xiangbi, with a strong desire to defend the motherland and Chairman Mao, enlisted in the army. He came from the Macheng Electrical Station of Chengguan Commune in Pengxi County, Sichuan, to the guard company of a certain air force unit on the frontline of the Yellow Sea. As soon as he entered the company, he felt that the entire unit was a big school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao's quotations were posted everywhere in the barracks, and Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics were written everywhere. Everyone carried Chairman Mao's books and spoke Chairman Mao's words. He devoted all his energy to the struggle of the Cultural Revolution, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the midst of class struggle and storms, and growing stronger.

Chairman Mao said, "We Communist Party members should face storms and see the world; this storm is the storm of mass struggle, and this world is the world of mass struggle." Lü Xiangbi firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and regarded the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the greatest storm and the greatest world. In August, the Red Guard youngsters went out into society, smashing the Four Olds and establishing the Four News, cleansing the muddy waters left over from the old society, and touching the souls of everyone. He had deep class feelings for the revolutionary Red Guard youngsters and firmly stood on the side of the Red Guards, enthusiastically supporting their revolutionary actions. In a diary entry in September, he wrote:

"The Red Guards are nurtured by Chairman Mao and are pointed in the right direction by Chairman Mao. They are correct. Chairman Mao is the supreme commander, and he has received the Red Guards three times. This is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses. It is truly wonderful!"

"The Red Guards have done many good things. Comrade Lin told us that the general direction of the Red Guards' struggle is always correct. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee firmly support them! The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers also firmly support them! They have exposed those anti-Party, anti-socialist elements and achieved great results. ... The Red Guards' rebellion against the bourgeoisie this time is truly wonderful. China has such Red Guards as successors, and it will never change color."

One Sunday morning, Lü Xiangbi went to the New China Bookstore in the county to buy the newly published treasure book—"Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

He stood in the line to buy books, holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," softly reciting. Suddenly, he looked up and saw a big-character poster on the wall denouncing the heinous crimes of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. Lü Xiangbi, looking and looking, couldn't help but clench his fists and curse, "Pah! What an old revolutionary, actually a counter-revolutionary!" He spoke with boundless admiration for the revolutionary youngsters, "They are truly Chairman Mao's little red soldiers! They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to rebel, and dare to expose that guy, thoroughly criticizing him, truly wonderful, wonderful!"

Although Lü Xiangbi was not assigned to support the revolutionary leftists in factories and villages, he enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses. In his ordinary position, he did everything possible and with all his strength to support the revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters. He helped the revolutionary leftists of the town's veterinary station and the militia camp of Xili Production Brigade to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. He helped the "August 1st" tractor repair shop with political and ideological work, encouraging the leftists to implement revolutionary unity. He went to the grain processing plant, participating in labor with actual actions to support the leftists in responding to Chairman Mao's great call, seizing the revolution, and vigorously promoting production. In addition, he also helped his relatives and friends in distant places through letters, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, encouraging them to firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

He felt that he was advancing with the revolutionary youngsters and revolutionary masses on the great road of proletarian cultural revolution, following the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao, advancing together, advancing together ...

	Establishing the Absolute Authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the Mind

	"Beijing has a golden sun,
	Shining day and night with golden light.
	The sun is Chairman Mao,
	He steers our ship.
	Beijing has a golden sun,
	His glory shines in all directions.
	The people of the world have him,
	The revolutionary struggle has a direction."

	Lü Xiangbi, like thousands and thousands of young people who have grown up in New China, has deep class feelings for Chairman Mao. He loves Chairman Mao with all his heart and follows Chairman Mao in making the revolution with all his heart. He loves to sing songs praising Chairman Mao the most. The above song is one he composed and sang at a party.

Comrades say: Lü Xiangbi's feelings for Chairman Mao are deeper than the sea. From morning to night, he always thinks of Chairman Mao. The first thing he does when he wakes up is to salute Chairman Mao's portrait, facing the rising red sun, singing "The East Is Red"; at night, before going to bed, he faces Beijing and sings "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." He says, "These two songs, singing them a thousand times, singing them ten thousand times, cannot express my love for Chairman Mao. These two songs, the more I sing, the more I love to sing, the more I sing, the more I feel Chairman Mao is close, the more I sing, the greater my enthusiasm."

He loves Chairman Mao's portrait very much. He cuts out Chairman Mao's portrait from newspapers, pastes it on his bed, puts it in his books, carries it with him, and often takes it out to look at. Looking and looking, he often cannot help but say, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Without you, there would be no Lü Xiangbi, without you, there would be no New China, without you, there would be no red world! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I, Lü Xiangbi, cannot take a step without you, all the people of China cannot take a step without you, and all the revolutionary people of the world cannot take a step without you!"

Lü Xiangbi loves to read Chairman Mao's books the most. He is determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. At every moment, he regards Chairman Mao's teachings as the first, highest, greatest, and heaviest of all. No matter how busy the work is, he insists on two "daily readings": reading Chairman Mao's books in the morning to consider how to do a good job for the day, and reading Chairman Mao's books in the evening to review and check the day's work and thoughts. He regards insisting on two "daily readings" as reporting to Chairman Mao in the morning and to Chairman Mao in the evening. On Sundays, he sits down for several hours, wholeheartedly reading Chairman Mao's works. He says, "Work can take a break, but studying Chairman Mao's works cannot take a break." He is determined to make "not asking for leave from studying Chairman Mao's works" a lifelong institution.

Chairman Mao said, "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." Lü Xiangbi followed Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning and using them, and working hard on transforming his world outlook and speeding up the revolutionization of his thoughts. After enlisting, he encountered issues such as work assignments, hardships, and fatigue. The deputy platoon leader helped him study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, which made his thoughts clear. He decided to be Zhang Sided in the kitchen, taking on heavy and tedious work. His family background is that of a middle peasant, and at first, he felt this would affect his progress. Later, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings on class analysis, realizing that he must bravely face the class imprint on his thoughts from his family background and firmly believe that as long as he studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, he can definitely transform his thoughts. He said, "My background is that of a middle peasant, but my thoughts must not be middle peasant thoughts, they must be proletarian, Mao Zedong Thought!" He wrote in his diary, "What is happiness? The liberation of all oppressed people in the world is my happiness. What is work? The needs of the people and the Party's assignments are my work. What is the future? Making contributions to the Party and the people, working for the people's interests at all times, is my future. What is glory? Sacrificing for the people is my glory."

Chairman Mao said, "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn." Lü Xiangbi resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further raising his class consciousness, and elevating the struggle to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and to transform his world outlook to a new height.

Last April 18th, the "Liberation Army Daily" published an editorial titled "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution" based on Chairman Mao's instructions. In the company, he was the first to study this editorial and suggested that the platoon leader organize the entire platoon to study it. He said, "This is the battle order issued by Chairman Mao to us, we must actively participate in this struggle." Chairman Mao personally decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Peking University and said at the reception of revolutionary masses, "You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" Chairman Mao's call greatly inspired Lü Xiangbi. He and all the comrades in the company actively participated in the criticism of the "Three Family Village," the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Zhou Yang, and all the monsters and demons. He often wrote critical articles after getting off duty at night and wrote letters to educate his family and relatives, mobilizing them to care about state affairs and actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to fight resolutely against the class enemy.

Chairman Mao taught us, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also completely for maintaining their power." Lü Xiangbi repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, studied important articles from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily." At the meeting organized by the company to denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in society, he compared the old and new societies, exposing the bitterness of the laboring people's lack of rights, and fiercely denounced the bourgeoisie's plot to restore power. He shouted, "The power obtained by countless revolutionary martyrs through blood and sacrifice, the class enemy wants to seize it, can we let them? No! A thousand times no! A million times no!"

In the education on the struggle between the two lines in the army, Lü Xiangbi heard that the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road proposed a bourgeois reactionary line, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, attempting to strangle the thriving Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He could not suppress his indignation. He and all the comrades in the platoon studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, talking about personal progress, the history of the development and growth of our Party and army, the history of the Chinese revolution, and the history of the world communist movement. He said excitedly, "Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the greatest interests of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest public interest. Whoever executes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we are with them, whoever opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will fight them. To defend the Party, to defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, I, Lü Xiangbi, dare to climb the knife mountain and leap into the fire sea, and I will never change my mind!"

Lü Xiangbi's short life, especially the year he spent in the army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and his rapid growth since he threw himself into the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, clearly tells us that to truly be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, one must truly establish Mao Zedong Thought as the absolute authority in one's mind. After Comrade Lü Xiangbi's heroic sacrifice, comrades, with reverent hearts, deeply engraved the following golden words on his tombstone and in their hearts:

"Comrade Lü Xiangbi established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in his mind."

    大立毛泽东思想绝对权威的光辉榜样——吕祥璧
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，黄海前哨某地出现了一位为抢救红卫兵小将而献身的共产主义战士吕祥璧。
    吕祥璧，这个英雄的名字，激励着人们向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的斗争中，当无畏的闯将！
    吕祥璧，这个英雄的名字，鼓舞着人们热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，为实现抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产的光荣任务，作最出色的模范！
    吕祥璧，这个英雄的名字，推动着人们，热爱革命小将，热爱革命群众，忠诚地执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！
    吕祥璧，这个英雄的名字，鞭策着人们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！
               把自己的一生献给党
    人们永远忘记不了英雄献身的那个壮烈的时刻！
    那是今年三月三日的下午，临时调到部队农牧场工作的警卫连战士吕祥璧，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，兴冲冲地套上青灰马，拉着铁板斗车，装上待修的农具来到白塔埠镇上。
    修理完农具，他便来到“八一”拖拉机修配厂，把准备改作粪罐的六个大汽油桶拉回部队。就在装车的时候，空油桶和铁板斗车撞击，发出刺耳的响声，青灰马受惊，撒蹄狂跑。这时小学正放学，狭小的街道上人来人往，车马要闯到人群里，怎么得了！吕祥璧焦急地用双手紧攥缰绳，想把马勒住。可是，空桶越颠越响，马越跑越快。一个急转弯，吕祥璧被甩倒在地。帮助装桶的几个工人同志，眼看吕祥璧有危险，一面猛追，一面高喊：“快撒手！快撒手！”这时，在马车前方十多米，有四个红卫兵小将被惊住了，只要几秒钟的工夫，一场严重的车祸就将发生！在这千钧一发之际，吕祥璧咬紧牙关，拚尽全力把缰绳紧紧攥住，用自己的身体坠住马头。拖出一米，不撒手！拖出两米，不撒手！拖出三米，还是不撒手！一直拖了六米。
    短短的六米，每一米都闪耀着吕祥璧热爱革命群众，热爱革命小将，一心为公，一生为公的共产主义思想光辉！
    短短的六米，每一米都表达了吕祥璧对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚！标志着吕祥璧头脑里树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，显示出战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力！
    短短的六米，每一米都是吕祥璧对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大肆鼓吹的“活命哲学”的有力回击！
    吕祥璧冒着生命危险，以惊人的毅力，把马头往下坠、再往下坠，……终于把马头坠到贴近地面，迫使青灰马向左转了个九十度的大弯，猛地打了个趔趄，连马带车栽倒在路旁的沟里。马倒车翻，四个红卫兵小将得救了，吕祥璧的头部却被车子砸伤，立即昏了过去。
    随后赶来的几个工人一涌而上，急忙把吕祥璧抬到公社医院。吕祥璧静静地躺在急救室里，嘴唇微张，仿佛在问：红卫兵小将受伤了没有？
    目睹这场舍己救人英雄行为的革命群众，感动万分。附近的工人、农民、学生飞步赶来探望。顿时，医院被一千多群众挤得水泄不通。他们纷纷要求为英雄献血，喊着同一个声音：“他是毛主席的好战士，是俺们白塔埠的刘英俊，一定要把他救活！”尽管医护人员采取了最紧急、最有效的抢救措施，但终因伤势过重，毛主席的好战士吕祥璧同志光荣牺牲了。围在医院内外的群众，久久不肯离去，他们含着热泪说：“吕祥璧同志永远活在我们心里！”
    同志们在清理烈士的遗物时，从他血染的口袋里找出了一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一张伟大领袖毛主席的像，还有前一天深夜才写成的一份入党申请书。在这份入党申请书上，吕祥璧写着这样一句话：“把自己的一生交给党安排！”
    吕祥璧以他壮烈的英雄行为，实践了自己的誓言，用鲜血和生命写下了他光辉历史的一页。他的崇高的思想和言行，为我们作出了树立毛泽东思想绝对权威的光辉榜样。
           对革命群众、革命小将一片赤心
    一九六六年的春天，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始了。二十一岁的吕祥璧怀着保卫祖国、保卫毛主席的强烈愿望，报名入伍，从四川蓬溪县城关公社机电站，来到黄海前哨空军某部警卫连。他一走进连队，就感受到整个部队是一座活学活用毛主席著作的大学校。营房内外，处处贴着毛主席语录，写着林彪同志突出政治的指示。毛主席的书，人人不离手，毛主席的话，个个不离口。他把全部精力投入到文化大革命的斗争中去，在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在大风大浪中，锻炼成长。
    毛主席说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”吕祥璧牢牢记住毛主席的教导，把无产阶级文化大革命，看作是最大的风雨，最大的世面。八月间，红卫兵小将们走向社会，大破四旧，大立四新，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水，触及着每个人的灵魂。他对红卫兵革命小将充满了深厚的阶级感情，坚决地站在红卫兵一边，热烈地支持小将们的革命行动。他在九月间的一篇日记中写道：
    “红卫兵是毛主席亲手培养的，是毛主席指明方向，没有错。毛主席当最高司令，三次接见红卫兵，对革命群众是多大的鼓励，真是好得很！”
    “红卫兵做了许多好事。林副主席告诉我们，红卫兵斗争的大方向，始终是正确的。毛主席和党中央坚决支持他们！广大工农兵群众也坚决支持他们！他们把那些反党反社会主义的家伙清了出来，做出很大的成绩。……红卫兵这次造资产阶级的反，就是好得很。中国有这样的红卫兵做接班人，永远都不能变色。”
    一个星期天的清晨，吕祥璧到县城新华书店购买新出版的宝书——《毛泽东选集》。
    他站在买书的队伍中，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，轻声诵读着。猛抬头，发现墙上贴着红卫兵小将声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行的大字报。吕祥璧看着看着，不由得握紧拳头，骂了声：“呸！啥子老革命，硬是个反革命！”他以无限敬佩革命小将的口气说：“真是毛主席的红小兵！敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢造反，把那个家伙揭发出来，彻底批判，硬是好，好得很！”
    吕祥璧虽然没有担负到工厂、农村支援革命左派的任务，但是，他热烈响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，在自己平凡的岗位上，尽一切可能，尽一切力量，支持革命群众和革命小将。他帮助镇上兽医站的无产阶级革命派和西柳生产大队民兵营活学活用毛主席著作。他帮助“八一”拖拉机修配厂做政治思想工作，鼓励革命派实行革命大联合。他到粮食加工厂，以参加劳动的实际行动，支持革命派响应毛主席伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产。另外，他还通过信件，帮助远在外地的亲友，向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，鼓励他们坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    他觉得自己就是和革命小将、革命群众一起，在无产阶级文化革命的大道上，沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，共同地前进着，前进着……。
    在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威
      “北京有个金太阳，
    日日夜夜放金光。
    太阳就是毛主席，
    他给我们把舵掌。
    北京有个金太阳，
    他的光辉照四方。
    世界人民有了他，
    革命斗争有方向。”
    吕祥璧，象我们千千万万个在新中国成长起来的青年一样，对毛主席有着非常深厚的阶级感情，他一个心眼地热爱毛主席，一个心眼地跟着毛主席闹革命。他最爱唱歌颂毛主席的歌。上面这支歌，就是他在一次晚会上自己编唱的。
    同志们说：吕祥璧对毛主席的感情比大海还深。他从早到晚，时时刻刻都想念着毛主席。他早起第一件事，就是向毛主席像敬礼，迎着冉冉升起的一轮红日，欢唱《东方红》；晚上，临睡前，他又面向北京，唱起《大海航行靠舵手》。他说：“这两支歌，唱一千遍，唱一万遍，也表达不尽我对毛主席的热爱。这两支歌，我越唱越爱唱，越唱越想唱，越唱越感到毛主席亲，越唱我的干劲越大。”
    他非常喜爱毛主席像。他把报纸上的毛主席像剪下来，贴在床头上，放在书本里，带在身上，经常拿出来看，看着看着，往往情不自禁地说：“毛主席呀毛主席！有了您，才有我吕祥璧，有了您，才有新中国，有了您，才能有红彤彤的新世界！毛主席呀毛主席！我吕祥璧一步离不开您，全中国人民一步离不开您，全世界革命人民也一步离不开您！”
    吕祥璧热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书。他下定决心，一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手。每时每刻都把毛主席的教导看得先于一切，高于一切，大于一切，重于一切。不管工作多忙，他每天都要坚持两个“天天读”：早上读毛主席的书，考虑怎样做好一天的工作；晚上读毛主席的书，对照检查一天的工作和思想。他把坚持两个“天天读”，当作早上向毛主席请示，晚上向毛主席汇报。星期天，他一坐下来就是几个小时，一心一意读毛主席著作。他说：“工作可以放假，学习毛主席著作不能放假。”他决心把“不向毛主席著作学习请假”作为自己一生的制度。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。吕祥璧遵照毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，学了就用，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，加速实现思想革命化。他入伍以后，遇到过工作分配、苦和累等等问题。副指导员帮助他学习了“老三篇”和毛主席有关教导，使他思想豁然开朗。他下决心要当伙房里的张思德，抢重活累活干。他的家庭出身是中农，开始他感到这会影响自己进步。后来，他按照毛主席关于阶级分析的教导，认识到，既要勇于正视家庭出身给自己思想打上的阶级烙印，又要坚信只要活学活用毛主席著作，就一定可以改造好思想，他说：“我的出身是中农，但我的思想决不能是中农思想，一定要是无产阶级的、毛泽东思想！”他在日记上写道：“什么是幸福？全世界受苦受压迫的人民得到解放，就是我的幸福。什么是工作？人民的需要和党的分配，就是我的工作。什么是前途？为党和人民作出了贡献，时时刻刻为人民利益而工作，就是我的前途。什么是光荣？为人民而牺牲，就是我的光荣。”
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”吕祥璧坚决按照毛主席这个教导去做，在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，使自己的阶级觉悟进一步提高，把破私立公，改造世界观的斗争提到一个新的高度。
    去年四月十八日，《解放军报》根据毛主席的指示精神，发表了《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》的社论，在班里他最先学习了这篇社论，还建议班长组织全班学习。他说：“这是毛主席向咱们发出的战斗号令，我们一定要积极参加这场斗争。”毛主席亲自决定发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义的大字报，又在接见革命群众时说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”毛主席的号召，使吕祥璧受到极大鼓舞。他和全连同志一道，积极参加了对“三家村”、对反革命修正主义分子周扬和一切牛鬼蛇神的批判，他经常在深夜下岗后，挥笔写批判文章，并且写信教育家庭、亲友，动员他们关心国家大事，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，向阶级敌人作坚决的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权”。吕祥璧反复学习了毛主席这一教导，学习了《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的重要文章。在连队组织的控诉社会上的反革命修正主义分子罪行大会上，他以新旧社会对比，说明劳动人民无权之苦，痛斥资产阶级的复辟阴谋。他大声地说：“无数革命先烈流血牺牲得来的政权，阶级敌人要来夺了，我们能叫他夺吗？不能！一千个不能！一万个不能！”
    在部队进行两条路线斗争的教育中，吕祥璧听到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派提出了资产阶级反动路线，对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，企图扼杀轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，他压制不住内心的怒火。他和全班同志一起学习毛主席有关教导，从个人进步的经历，谈到我党我军发展壮大史、中国革命史、世界共产主义运动史。他激动地说：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，代表了中国人民和世界革命人民的最大利益。忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最大的公。谁执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线我们就和谁亲，谁反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线我们就和谁拚。为了保卫党，保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我吕祥璧刀山敢上，火海敢闯，誓死不变心！”
    吕祥璧短短的一生，特别是他来到部队这座毛泽东思想大学校，投身于伟大的无产阶级文化大革命以来迅速成长的一年，清楚地告诉我们，要真正做一个毛主席的好战士，就必须在自己的头脑里真正用毛泽东思想挂帅。吕祥璧同志英勇牺牲后，同志们怀着崇敬的心情，在他的墓碑上，也在自己的心坎上，深深地刻下了这样几个金光闪闪的大字：
    “吕祥璧同志在头脑里树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。”
