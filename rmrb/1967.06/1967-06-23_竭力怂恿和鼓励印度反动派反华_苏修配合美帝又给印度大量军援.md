New Delhi, June 23 (Xinhua) — The Soviet revisionist leadership has recently continued to collaborate with U.S. imperialism to provide the Indian reactionary government with large amounts of military aid, inciting and supporting it to make military threats and armed invasions against China and other neighboring countries.

The Indian Press Trust recently cited a report from the U.S. "New York Times" revealing that the Soviet government has agreed to provide the Indian government with 200 new Soviet-made Su-7 fighter-bombers.

According to a recent report from the U.S. "Washington Star Evening News," since October 1962, when the Indian government launched a large-scale attack on China and suffered a defeat, the Soviet revisionist leadership has provided the Indian reactionaries with a large amount of military aid, including: four submarines, more than 50 MiG-21 fighter jets, 74 transport aircraft, more than 100 helicopters, 100 tanks (and another 200 tanks on order), 17 missile launch sites, each equipped with six missiles. In addition, the Soviet revisionist leadership has helped India establish three assembly plants for MiG-21 fighter jets, which produced the first batch of jets last year. Indian newspapers have also revealed that the Soviet revisionists agreed in 1963 to provide India with heavy artillery and radar equipment.

The total value of the above aid is approximately $900 million. In addition, the Soviet revisionists have pledged to provide India with $2 billion in non-military aid, with the focus on helping the Indian reactionaries lay the foundation for a military industry.

The Soviet revisionists' large-scale military aid to the Indian reactionary government is one of the main aspects of their long-term collusion with U.S. imperialism to incite India against China. The Soviet revisionists, in collusion with the U.S., have been vigorously supporting the Indian reactionaries politically, economically, and militarily, aiming to make India the spearhead and military base for U.S.-Soviet containment of China in Asia. In the past four years, the military aid provided by the Soviet revisionists to the Indian reactionaries has been even greater than that provided by the U.S. This approach has been applauded by U.S. and British imperialists. U.S. reactionary newspapers have joyfully stated: "The Soviet Union, India, and the U.S. have common interests in containing China—not only on the Indian border but throughout Southeast Asia." Western news agencies have pointed out that in this regard, Moscow has become an "open ally" of Washington and London.

The Soviet revisionists have never hidden the fact that their military aid to India is mainly for anti-China purposes. The more rampant the Indian reactionary government's anti-China activities, the more and faster the Soviet revisionists provide military aid. According to Indian newspapers, in 1965, the Soviet revisionist leaders clearly stated to the Indian reactionary government's defense minister and steel minister that they were willing to provide India with "unlimited defense aid," "whatever you need, we will provide." In 1964, the Indian defense minister announced in parliament that this "aid" from the Soviet revisionists could be used "against China." Indian newspapers have also reported that "due to the escalating tensions on the Sino-Indian-Pakistani borders, Soviet military supplies to India will begin to be shipped as soon as possible."

Another purpose of the Soviet revisionists' military aid to India is to provide cover for the Indian government, which has openly aligned itself with U.S. imperialism and used U.S. military aid to incite against China, attempting to prove that it has not "leaned towards" U.S. imperialism and remains a "non-aligned" country. In reality, the Indian reactionaries' acceptance of military aid from both the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists means they have formed a dual military alliance with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

The Soviet revisionists' military aid to the Indian government is also aimed at helping the Indian reactionaries oppress Pakistan. In September 1965, during the Indian reactionaries' invasion of Pakistan, they used MiG-21 fighter jets provided by the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists' continued military aid to India is also aimed at helping the U.S. imperialists create a military advantage for India over Pakistan.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, has provided the Indian reactionary government with large amounts of military aid, fueling the Indian reactionaries' aggressive and oppressive behavior against neighboring countries and internally suppressing the people. This has led the Indian reactionary government to pursue a policy of military expansion and preparation for war, regardless of the lives of the Indian people. In the past five years, the Indian government's military expenditure has nearly quadrupled. To expand the military and prepare for war, the Indian reactionary government has intensified the exploitation of the Indian people, increased taxes, and ruthlessly exploited the working people. The Indian reactionary government's recently proposed budget for the current year stipulates that military expenditure will account for nearly 30% of total expenditure, while significantly increasing taxes on various daily necessities for the working people. This will lead to a further surge in prices, and the general household expenditure will increase by about 30%. These facts show that the Soviet revisionists, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, have provided large amounts of military aid to the Indian reactionaries, which is a plunder of the Indian people. The Soviet revisionists' despicable behavior is also completely against the interests of the people of Asia and the world.

### 竭力怂恿和鼓励印度反动派反华  苏修配合美帝又给印度大量军援

    竭力怂恿和鼓励印度反动派反华
    苏修配合美帝又给印度大量军援
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团最近继续配合美帝国主义，向印度反动派提供大量军事援助，怂恿和支持它向中国和其它邻国进行军事威胁和武装侵略。
    印度报业托辣斯最近援引美国《纽约时报》的一则消息透露，苏联政府已经答应给印度政府两百架苏联新式的苏—7型战斗轰炸机。
    又据美国《华盛顿明星晚报》最近透露，从一九六二年十月印度政府向中国发动大规模进攻遭到失败到目前为止的四年多期间内，苏联修正主义领导集团给了印度反动派大量军事援助，包括：四艘潜水艇、五十多架米格—21型飞机、七十四架运输机、一百多架直升飞机、一百辆坦克（另外订购了两百辆坦克）、十七个导弹发射场，每一个发射场配有六枚导弹。此外，苏修领导集团还帮助印度建立了三家制造米格—21型飞机的装配工厂，去年已经生产出第一批飞机。此外，印度报纸曾经透露，苏修还在一九六三年同意给予印度重炮和雷达装置等军用物资。
    以上这些援助约值九亿美元。此外，苏修保证向印度提供二十亿美元的非军事援助，这种援助的重点是帮助印度反动派奠定军事工业的基础。
    苏修给印度反动政府大规模的军事援助，是它多年来勾结美帝联印反华活动的主要内容之一。苏修伙同美帝竭力在政治上、经济上、军事上扶植印度反动派，目的就是把印度作为美苏在亚洲的反华急先锋和反华军事基地。在过去四年多的期间内，苏修给印度反动派的军事援助，比美帝所给的还要多。这种做法，得到了美英帝国主义的喝采。美国反动报纸欣喜若狂地说：“苏、印、美在遏制中国——不仅在印度边界上，而且在整个东南亚——方面有共同的利益。”西方通讯社曾指出，在这方面，莫斯科已经“成为华盛顿和伦敦的公开的盟友”。
    苏修毫不隐讳他们给印度的军援主要是供反华之用。印度反动政府反华越猖獗，苏修给它军援就越多，提供得越快。据印度报纸报道，在一九六五年，苏修领导人就曾经向印度反动政府的国防部长和钢铁部长明确表示，愿意向印度提供“没有限制的国防援助”，“你们要什么，我们就给什么”。在一九六四年，印度国防部长在议会宣布，苏修的这些“援助”，可以用来“对付中国”。印度报纸还曾报道，“由于中、印、巴边境紧张局势在加剧，苏联给印度的军火将尽快开始启运。”
    苏修给印度军援的另一个目的，是为公开投靠美帝、利用美国军事援助反华的印度政府打掩护，企图证明它“没有倒向”美帝，仍然是一个“不结盟国家”。实际上，印度反动派接受美苏的军援，是同美帝苏修结成了双重的军事联盟。
    苏修给印度政府军事援助，也是为了帮助印度反动派欺压巴基斯坦。一九六五年九月，印度反动派在向巴基斯坦发动侵略战争中，就使用了苏修提供的米格—21型战斗机。苏修继续给予印度军事援助，也是为了配合美帝造成印度对巴基斯坦的军事优势。
    苏联修正主义领导集团伙同美帝国主义给印度反动政府大量军事援助，助长了印度反动派对外威胁邻国、对内残暴地镇压人民的反动气焰，促使它不顾印度广大人民的死活，更加疯狂地奉行扩军备战政策。在过去五年里，印度政府的军费增加了将近四倍。为了扩军备战，印度反动政府加紧剥削印度人民，大量增加税收，疯狂地压榨劳动人民。印度反动政府最近提出的本年度预算，规定军费占总支出的将近百分之三十，同时大量增加劳动人民的多种日用品的税收，这样将引起物价继续飞涨，一般人民家庭的开支将要增加百分之三十左右。这些说明，苏修伙同美帝给予印度反动派大量军事援助，是对印度人民的一种掠夺。苏修的这种卑鄙行为，也是完全违反亚洲和世界人民的利益的。
