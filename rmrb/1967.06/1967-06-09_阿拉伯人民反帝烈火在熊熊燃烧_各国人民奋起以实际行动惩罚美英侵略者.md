The aggressive war launched by U.S. and British imperialism and their tool of aggression, Israel, has made the anti-imperialist fire of the broad masses of the Arab countries burn more fiercely. In recent days, the people of various Arab countries have taken various practical actions to punish their common enemy—the U.S. and British imperialists.

In the streets of Cairo, more and more anti-American banners and slogans can be seen. They read: "Down with U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel!" "We are determined to fight against U.S. and British interference!"

In the heroic city of Suez, hundreds of youths held a demonstration in front of the U.S. consulate on the afternoon of June 6. They shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" Afterwards, these youths went to the Chinese consulate in Suez, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to China for its support. They shouted, "Long live the People's Republic of China!"

In the important Syrian city of Aleppo, hundreds of people held an anti-American demonstration on June 7. They shouted slogans such as "U.S. and British imperialism are the enemies of the Arab people!" and angrily set fire to the U.S. and British consulates in the city. According to reports, that night, the two imperialist countries' consuls fled to Turkey in a hurry, not even taking a handbag with them.

In the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, the masses held anti-American demonstrations for three consecutive days starting from June 5. On June 7, demonstrators shouting "Oppose the collusion of the U.S., Britain, and Israel!" stormed into the U.S. club in Khartoum, smashed the furniture inside, and set it on fire. Subsequently, the demonstrators also destroyed the local U.S. cinema and theater.

The workers' union at Khartoum Airport decided not to allow aircraft from the U.S., Britain, and West Germany to land at the airport, expressing their strong protest.

In the Sudanese port, the postal and telecommunications workers' union implemented the decision to boycott U.S. and British aircraft and ships on June 6. At the same time, the dock workers there also refused to unload cargo from two British ships that had arrived in Sudan.

In British-occupied South Yemen, the nationalist organizations the National Front for the Liberation of South Yemen and the National Liberation Front issued calls for the people of South Yemen to sabotage British refineries and other British facilities. Due to many workers going on strike and shops closing, the city of Aden was in a state of semi-paralysis on June 6. The drivers of the British Shell Company also went on strike, and the gas stations in Aden had no gasoline supply by the evening of June 6. Throughout South Yemen, sporadic gunshots and the sound of hand grenades exploding could be heard all day, and the U.S. consulate was hit by a hand grenade.

The dock workers' union in Lebanon decided on June 8 to boycott all U.S. and British ships docked in Lebanese ports. The dock workers in Morocco also boycotted U.S. and British ships docked in Moroccan ports. They refused to load and unload cargo for U.S. and British ships.

In the Mauritanian capital of Nouakchott, hundreds of people demonstrated in front of the U.S. embassy on June 6. Subsequently, they rushed to the West German embassy, which supports Israel, and threw stones at the building and the residence of the ambassador, tearing down the West German flag.

    阿拉伯人民反帝烈火在熊熊燃烧
    各国人民奋起以实际行动惩罚美英侵略者
    据新华社八日讯　美英帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列悍然发动的侵略战争，使得阿拉伯国家广大人民的反帝烈火越烧越旺。连日来，阿拉伯各国人民纷纷起来采取各种实际行动，惩罚他们的共同敌人——美英帝国主义。
    在开罗街头可以看到越来越多的反美的横幅标语。上面写着：“打倒美帝国主义及其走狗以色列！”“我们决心进行反对美英干涉的斗争！”
    在英雄的塞得港，数百名青年六日下午在美国领事馆门前举行示威游行。他们高呼：“打倒美帝国主义”等口号。随后，这些青年前往塞得港的中国领事馆，表示他们衷心感谢中国对他们的支持。他们高呼：“人民中国万岁！”
    在叙利亚的重要城市阿勒颇，有数百人七日举行反美示威。他们高呼“美英帝国主义是阿拉伯人民的敌人！”等口号，并愤怒地向设在当地的美国和英国领事馆放火。据报道，当晚，这两个帝国主义国家的总领事竟连个手提包都没有带，就狼狈地偷偷越境溜到土耳其去了。
    在苏丹首都喀土穆，人民群众从五日起连续三天举行了反美大示威。七日，高呼“反对美英同以色列勾结！”口号的示威者，又一次愤怒地冲进了设在喀土穆的美国俱乐部，捣毁了里面的家具，并在里面放了火。随后，示威者又捣毁了当地的美国电影院和剧院。
    喀土穆机场的职工工会作出决定，不准美、英、西德的飞机在这个机场降落，以表示他们的强烈抗议。
    在苏丹港口的邮电工会六日执行了关于抵制美国和英国的飞机和船只的决定。同时，那里的码头工人也拒绝为已经到达苏丹的两艘英国船卸货。
    在被英国占领的南也门，民族主义组织南也门解放阵线和民族解放阵线分别发出号召，要求南也门人民破坏英国炼油厂和英国的其它设施。由于许多工人罢工、商店罢市，亚丁这个城市在六日已陷于半瘫痪状态。英国壳牌公司的油车司机也罢了工，设在亚丁的汽油站在六日晚已没有汽油供应。在南也门整天都听到零星的枪声和手榴弹爆炸声，美国领事馆也挨了一颗手榴弹。
    黎巴嫩码头工人工会八日决定抵制停泊在黎巴嫩所有港口的美英船只。摩洛哥的码头工人也对美英两国停泊在摩洛哥港口的船只实行了抵制。他们拒绝为美英船只装卸货物。
    在毛里塔尼亚首都努瓦克肖特，有数百人在六日到美国大使馆外面举行了示威。随后，他们还冲向支持以色列的西德的大使馆，用石头砸了这个使馆的建筑物和它的大使的住宅，扯下了西德的国旗。
