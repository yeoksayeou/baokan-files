	Premier Zhou Reiterates at a Banquet for African Envoys Welcoming President Kaunda
	That the United Nations Must Correct Its Mistakes and Undergo a Thorough Reorganization and Transformation

	Many friendly countries in Asia and Africa can struggle within the United Nations, while China will struggle outside the United Nations. If this goal cannot be achieved, the possibility of establishing a new revolutionary United Nations will increase day by day.

	New China News Agency, June 24th: Premier Zhou Enlai today once again strongly condemned the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in using the United Nations, and reiterated that the United Nations must correct all its past mistakes, must undergo a thorough reorganization and transformation, and must break away from the hegemony it promotes. All countries, big or small, must be equal. For this purpose, many friendly countries in Asia and Africa can struggle within the United Nations, while China will struggle outside the United Nations. If this goal cannot be achieved, the possibility of establishing a new revolutionary United Nations will increase day by day.

	Premier Zhou Enlai made these remarks at a banquet held by envoys from African countries in China to welcome President Kaunda of Zambia's visit to China.

	In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai extended greetings to the fighting peoples of Asia and Africa and thanked many friendly countries in Africa and Asia for supporting the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations and opposing the "two Chinas" position. Premier Zhou reiterated that the United Nations must correct all its past mistakes, must undergo a thorough reorganization and transformation, must break away from the hegemony it promotes, and must achieve equality for all countries, big or small. For this purpose, many friendly countries in Asia and Africa can struggle within the United Nations, while China will struggle outside the United Nations. If this goal cannot be achieved, the possibility of establishing a new revolutionary United Nations will increase day by day.

	Premier Zhou said that the oppressed peoples and nations of Asia and Africa must first and foremost rely on their own efforts to achieve a thorough victory in their anti-imperialist struggle, and only then can they rely on mutual support among the peoples of Asia and Africa. The peoples of Asia and Africa must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "wisdom" of imperialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys. Johnson and Kosygin are engaged in a dirty deal, and the result of their deal will not satisfy the just demands of the Arab people and may continue to harm and betray the interests of the Vietnamese people. It will definitely continue to oppose the interests of the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world. The peoples of all countries, especially the peoples of Asia and Africa, must be vigilant against the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in using the United Nations.

	Premier Zhou proposed a toast to the great unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

	Today, the envoys from seven African countries—Egypt, Algeria, Guinea, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), Tanzania, and Kenya—held a luncheon to wish President Kaunda of Zambia and his wife, along with other Zambian friends, a successful visit to China and to wish for the development of friendly cooperation between China and Zambia.

	President Kaunda spoke at the banquet, expressing Zambia's support for the just struggles of the Arab people, the Vietnamese people, and all oppressed and exploited peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	The representative of the African envoys, Egyptian Ambassador to China Imam, spoke first at the banquet. He expressed that they fully support the efforts of China and Zambia to strengthen Asian-African solidarity and oppose imperialism, support the struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, and support the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations.

	After Ambassador Imam and President Kaunda spoke, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the above remarks.

	Invited to attend the banquet were also Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and responsible officials from various relevant departments of our country.

    周总理在非洲国家使节欢迎卡翁达总统的宴会上重申
    联合国必须纠正错误彻底改组和改造
    亚非许多友好国家可以在联合国内斗争，中国则在联合国外进行斗争。如果这个目的不能达到，成立一个新的革命的联合国的可能性，就会日益增长。
    新华社二十四日讯　周恩来总理今天再次强烈谴责美帝和苏修利用联合国进行大勾结，并重申联合国必须纠正它过去的一切错误，必须加以彻底改组和改造。
    周恩来总理是在非洲国家驻中国使节为欢迎卡翁达总统访问中国而举行的宴会上讲这些话的。
    周恩来总理在讲话中向战斗的亚非各国人民致意，并且感谢非洲、亚洲许多友好国家支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位、反对两个中国的正义立场。周总理重申，联合国必须纠正它过去的一切错误，必须加以彻底改组和改造，必须打破它推行的强权政治，必须实现大小国家一律平等。为此目的，亚非许多友好国家可以在联合国内斗争，中国则在联合国外进行斗争。如果这个目的不能达到，成立一个新的革命的联合国的可能性，就会日益增长。
    周总理说，亚非被压迫人民和被压迫民族要取得反帝斗争的彻底胜利，首先而且主要必须依靠自己的努力，其次才是依靠亚非人民的互相支援。亚非各国人民决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义、现代修正主义和他们的走狗的“明智”上面。约翰逊和柯西金正在进行一笔肮脏的交易，他们交易的结果，决不会满足阿拉伯人民的正义要求，可能还会继续损害和出卖越南人民的利益，并且一定会继续反对中国人民和世界革命人民的利益。各国人民，首先是亚非人民对美帝和苏修利用联合国进行的大勾结，必须提高警惕。
    周总理最后提议为亚非人民的大团结而干杯。
    今天，阿联、阿尔及利亚、几内亚、马里、刚果（布）、坦桑尼亚、肯尼亚七个非洲国家驻中国的使节举行午宴，祝赞比亚共和国总统卡翁达和夫人以及其他赞比亚朋友访问中国获得成功，祝中赞两国的友好合作关系获得发展。
    卡翁达总统在宴会上致词，他表示赞比亚支持阿拉伯人民、越南人民以及亚非拉一切被压迫被剥削的人民的正义斗争。
    非洲国家使节代表、阿联驻中国大使伊马姆在宴会上首先致词。他表示，他们完全支持赞中两国致力于加强亚非团结和反对帝国主义的立场，表示支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争，支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位。
    在伊马姆大使和卡翁达总统讲话之后，周恩来总理发表了上述的讲话。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，以及我国各有关方面的负责人。
