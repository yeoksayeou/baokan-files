The reactionary film "Two Families" begins with a voiceover suggesting to the audience: "Our country's 1953 is something we should look back on and think about." This film was completed in 1963. One cannot help but ask: Why does the film urge people to "look back and think about" 1953 at this time? What exactly is the "something" that is "worth" looking back on and thinking about?

The film's backdrop is 1953. This was precisely the eve of the decisive battle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside, the critical moment when our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the nationwide development of agricultural cooperatives.

The film fabricates the image of an "old poor peasant" named Gao Zhengguo, describing how, on the eve of the agricultural cooperative movement, he vigorously promoted the exploitative class theory of "there will always be rich and poor in the world" and fervently advocated for capitalism. This "old poor peasant" openly stated, "Being a model is at most getting a hoe," and "What's the use of glory? Going to a meeting means being away for ten days, and during these ten days, I have to drive the ox cart, which is how much money?" For money, he used every means to resist the grain procurement system implemented by the Party in the countryside at that time; for money, he did not participate in the labor of the mutual aid group, engaged in disguised exploitation within the group, and also drove his newly bought ox cart to make money. The "old poor peasant" Gao Zhengguo desperately saved money to realize his "five-year plan": storing grain, opening a large mill, buying ten acres of land, hiring two helpers, and so on. His plan was to implement capitalism in the countryside, that is, the rich peasant economic system. In the film, Gao Zhengguo, relying on his individual efforts, bought an ox cart and land, and his ambition to realize his capitalist "plan" was smoothly progressing. However, the agricultural cooperative movement "did not get along with me," shattering his beautiful dream.

Through the story of the "old poor peasant" Gao Zhengguo becoming wealthy through individual farming and then being ruined by the cooperative movement, the film sings a dirge for the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside; while it grossly distorts and slanders the cooperative movement led by our great leader Chairman Mao, revealing their deep hatred for the socialist revolution.

The film urges people to "look back and think about" this tale of capitalist restoration.

This tale of capitalist restoration, released in 1963, is an artistic specimen created based on the counterrevolutionary revisionist theory of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. It uses the despicable method of hinting at one thing while referring to another to launch a ferocious counterattack against the cooperative movement personally led by Chairman Mao, and to launch a mad assault on socialism, lamenting the shattered dream of implementing capitalism in China by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

This biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the number one agent of capitalist forces in the countryside within the Party. Since liberation, he has been vigorously advocating for the development of capitalism in the countryside. He once brazenly advocated for the "long-term preservation of the rich peasant economy," urging farmers to "farm individually," and saying that the "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style of rich peasant economy should not be "interfered with"!

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." Chairman Mao pointed out that the direction for agriculture is socialism, which is the direction for five hundred million peasants. Our country's countryside, following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, moved from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, and in 1958, achieved the establishment of people's communes. The evil schemes of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his accomplices to restore capitalism did not succeed.

The enemy is not willing to admit defeat. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, taking advantage of the temporary difficulties in our country's national economy due to three years of natural disasters, stirred up a "reversal" wind, attempting to drag the countryside back to the old path of individual economy. He shouted, "Collective economy has a crisis, a crisis of dispersal, a crisis of disintegration." He screamed, "Contract production to households, individual farming!" Thus, the "three autonomies and one contract," and the "individual farming wind" blew up. For a time, smoke filled the sky, and the noise was deafening.

The reactionary film "Two Families" emerged in coordination with the shouts of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

Look, the Gao Zhengguo in the film is not precisely the representative figure of the "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style of rich peasant economy advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party!

This Gao Zhengguo confidently propagates the idea of "pigs push forward, chickens scratch backward, each has its own path"; China's Khrushchev also propagates the idea of "during the transition period, all methods that benefit the mobilization of peasants' production enthusiasm can be used, do not say that one method is the best, the only one." Their tunes are so similar.

China's Khrushchev shouted, "People's communes were established too early," "it would be better not to establish them"; the film, following suit, uses Gao Zhengguo's experience of being driven to bankruptcy by the agricultural cooperative movement to imply that the cooperative movement lacks a mass base.

It is clear that behind the voiceover's suggestion to "think about," the gleam of the class enemy's blade is revealed. It responds to the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, dreaming of destroying the people's communes and cheering for the restoration of capitalism.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the reactionary film "Two Families" ultimately boil down to one sentence: In China, changing the dictatorship of the proletariat to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and achieving the restoration of capitalism.

However, no matter how hysterically they shout, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and those behind the film, their dream of restoring capitalism will never come true!

    一本复辟资本主义的“变天账”
    ——评反动影片《两家人》
    中央戏剧学院红旗文艺兵团
    反动影片《两家人》的片头，用“旁白”的手法向人们提示：“我们国家的一九五三年，非常值得我们回头想一想。……”
    这部影片是一九六三年摄制完成的。人们不禁要问：影片为什么在这个时候号召人们去“回头想一想”一九五三年呢？它鼓吹的“非常值得”“回头想一想”的究竟又是什么东西呢？
    影片的背景是一九五三年。这正是我国社会主义同资本主义两条道路在农村决战的前夜，正是我们伟大领袖毛主席所亲自领导的农业合作化运动即将在全国范围内普遍开展的关键时刻。
    影片编造了一个“老贫农”高正国的形象，描写他在农业合作化运动的前夜，大肆鼓吹“世上总要有穷有富”的剥削阶级理论，狂热地发展资本主义。这个“老贫农”公然说：“当模范顶多捞把锄头”，“要那光荣顶什么呀？一去开会就是十几天，这十几天里我要赶牛车，那是多少票子？”为了钱，他千方百计地抵制当时党在农村的余粮征购制；为了钱，他不参加农业互助组内的劳动，在组内搞变相剥削，还用新买的牛车拉脚赚钱。“老贫农”高正国拚命地攒钱，为的是实现他心目中的那个“五年计划”：储存粮食、开个大粉房、买进十亩土地、请两个帮工等等。他的如意算盘，就是要在农村实行资本主义，即富农经济制度。在影片里，高正国依靠单干的力量，买了牛车买了地，野心勃勃地顺利地实现着发展资本主义的“计划”。但是农业合作化运动“跟我过不去”，使他的黄粱美梦破灭了。
    影片通过“老贫农”高正国单干发家，又被合作化搞得破产的故事，为农村的资本主义的自发势力唱挽歌；而对我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下开展的合作化运动，大肆歪曲、诬蔑，表现了他们对社会主义革命的刻骨仇恨。
    影片让人们“回头想一想”的就是这样一本资本主义复辟的“变天账”。
    在一九六三年抛出来的这笔复辟资本主义的“变天账”，是根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义理论炮制出来的一个艺术标本。它用指桑骂槐的卑劣手法，向毛主席亲自领导的合作化运动进行猖狂的反扑，向社会主义发动疯狂的进攻，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在中国实行资本主义的幻梦破灭大鸣不平。
    这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是农村的资本主义势力在党内的头号代理人。从解放以来，他就极力鼓吹在农村发展资本主义。他曾经猖狂地叫嚷要“长期保存富农经济”，号召农民“单干”，说什么对“三马一犁一车”式的富农经济不要“干涉”！
    但是，正如毛主席所指出的：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”毛主席指出农业走社会主义道路是五亿农民的方向。我国农村朝着毛主席所指出的方向，由初级社到高级社，于一九五八年，又实现了人民公社化，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的同伙们企图复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当没有得逞。
    敌人是不甘心失败的。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派趁我国三年自然灾害、国民经济遇到暂时困难之机，又刮起了一阵“翻案”风，妄想把农村拉回到个体经济的老路上去。他叫嚷说：“集体经济有危机，有散的危机，瓦解的危机。”他声嘶力竭地叫喊：“包产到户、单干”！于是“三自一包”、“单干风”刮起来了。一时乌烟滚滚，甚嚣尘上。
    反动影片《两家人》配合着党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的叫嚷，出笼了。
    请看，影片中那个高正国，不正是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“三马一犁一车”式的富农经济的代表人物吗！
    这个高正国振振有词地宣扬什么“猪往前拱、鸡往后扒，各有各的路”；中国赫鲁晓夫也在宣扬什么“过渡时期一切有利于调动农民生产积极性的办法都可以，不要说那一种办法是最好的，唯一的。”他们的调子竟是如此相似。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫大叫“人民公社办早了”“不办要更好一些”；影片如法炮制，用高正国被农业合作化逼得破产的遭遇，来影射合作化运动没有群众基础。
    可见，在影片旁白所提示“想一想”的后面，闪露着阶级敌人的刀光剑影。它与党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派上呼下应，梦想搞垮人民公社，为资本主义复辟摇旗呐喊。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派所呼叫的，以及反动影片《两家人》所表现的，归根结底就是一句话：在中国变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。
    但是，不管影片及其背后支持者党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，怎样歇斯底里地叫喊，他们复辟资本主义的美梦是永远不能得逞的！
