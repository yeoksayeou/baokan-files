Various places' military and civilians enthusiastically celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao personally deciding to publish the nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster. They are determined to achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," thoroughly criticize and denounce the party's top capitalist-roaders, and do a good job of struggle-criticism-transformation in their units.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on June 1, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary rebels, and revolutionary cadres across the country enthusiastically celebrate the decision by our great leader Chairman Mao to broadcast and publish in newspapers the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster from Peking University. They enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the editorial "Great Strategic Measure" in the _Red Flag_ magazine and the _People's Daily_. The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary cadres say with great excitement that Chairman Mao's great strategic measure ignited the blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution, pointed out the main target, path, and methods of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works better, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party and the capitalist-roaders in our units and regions politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We will gradually complete the tasks of struggle-criticism-transformation and carry the cultural revolution through to the end.

In Peking, Shanghai, Harbin, Guiyang, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses held celebration meetings, symposiums, and grand celebration parades to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's decision to publish the nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University, along with revolutionary cadres from the capital and more than a hundred foreign friends, gathered at Peking University today to enthusiastically celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's decision to publish the nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster and celebrate the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University and the proletarian revolutionary cadres from the capital said, Chairman Mao's decision to publish the nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster from Peking University is a great and wise strategic measure. Under the fierce attacks of the surging cultural revolution army, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the party have been engulfed in the vast ocean of people's war. One after another, the strongholds of the bourgeoisie have collapsed, and big and small capitalist-roaders have been overthrown. This is a great victory of boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their determination to firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, do a good job of struggle-criticism-transformation in their units, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. The red rebels of the Peking Hoisting Machine Factory, while studying the editorial "Great Strategic Measure" in the _Red Flag_ magazine and the _People's Daily_, reviewed the fighting course and great victories of the proletarian cultural revolution mass movement over the past year. They said, Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee of our revolutionary victories. We seized power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and we will hold power firmly relying on Mao Zedong Thought. We must respond to Chairman Mao's call, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and always direct the spearhead at the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. We must remember Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, not only regard ourselves as a force of the revolution but also regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world and also use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective world, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and march forward bravely!

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionary cadres and Red Guards in Shanghai said, during the days when the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party threw out the bourgeois reactionary line to impose white terror on the proletarian revolutionary cadres, our most respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" shook the earth and echoed through the universe, giving a devastating blow to China's Khrushchev and his henchmen—the big and small handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, and greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary cadres. Now, the arrogant handful of capitalist-roaders in the party have finally been exposed! Their conspiracy to restore capitalism has been exposed and smashed! "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy bravely than to seek fame by learning from King Xiang Yu." We will resolutely follow the direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao and march forward bravely. Wang Xiuzhen, a responsible person of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, said, we must firmly grasp the direction of struggle, direct the spearhead at the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. At the same time, we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, seize the power of the "self" in our heads, resolutely oppose anarchism, achieve great unity in the great criticism, and promote the "three-in-one combination."

Comrade Jie Yue, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and a female worker from the 126 Textile Mill, said excitedly, our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic measure has pointed out the targets, paths, and methods of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat for the whole party and the nation. The struggle practice over the past year has made us deeply realize that the main target of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the big and small handful of capitalist-roaders in the party; throughout the entire historical period of socialism, the focus of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is the struggle between the proletariat to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the issue of power, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end, making the red socialist mountains eternal and unchanging for thousands of generations! Famous labor models Li Shunda and Shen Jilan said, at present, the proletarian revolutionary cadres in our Pingxian County have achieved great victories in the struggle for power and established a temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." However, this is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. In the future, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

Comrade Li Zaichan, Chairman of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and Political Commissar of the Guizhou Military Region, said at a celebration meeting of 50,000 people: Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most, and is heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao always gives great support and enthusiastic praise to the new things created by the masses. Facts have proven that the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and strongest. We must put the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Wang Yunrong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, said in an article titled "Forever Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Forever Carry Forward the Spirit of Proletarian Revolutionary Rebellion": Chairman Mao teaches us, "The enemy will not disappear by itself," they are always trying to restore capitalism at every moment. We proletarian revolutionary cadres who have seized power and the broad revolutionary masses must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Wang Jiadao, Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee and Commander of the Heilongjiang Military Region, said at a gathering of 200,000 red rebels and revolutionary masses in Harbin: The nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster personally decided by our great leader Chairman Mao ignited the blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution. The proletarian revolutionary cadres and Red Guards under the shining guidance of Mao Zedong Thought have achieved great victories. Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon for seizing power, holding power, and using power well, it is our lifeline, and it is the fundamental guarantee to prevent the restoration of capitalism. We must raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, launch a new high tide, and turn every industry in the province into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers of the Xin Feng Processing Factory, the Petroleum Fittings Factory, and the Red Guards of the Harbin Military Engineering Academy said, one year ago today, Chairman Mao personally approved the publication of the nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster, like a spring thunder, shook all of China and the world. This is our great leader Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest support, and greatest encouragement for us proletarian revolutionary cadres. Under Chairman Mao's call, we launched fierce attacks on the bourgeois reactionary line, exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, and seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from their hands. All this is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! We must firmly grasp the direction of struggle, direct the spearhead at the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, thoroughly criticize and denounce them, and eliminate their poison.

Ten thousand revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers and officers in Jinan held a gathering and parade. Comrade Wang Zhucan, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Revolutionary Committee, said at the meeting: We must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, push the great criticism to a new high tide, and achieve greater victories in the cultural revolution. The young rebels of Lu Xun University in Shandong reviewed the struggles of the past year and said, to firmly grasp the direction of struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, dare to sweep away the "self" in our heads. They said, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party are always trying every means to make us deviate from the direction of struggle and create chaos in our revolutionary ranks. We will not fall for this trick. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, distinguish who are our enemies and who are our friends, win over and unite the masses who have been deceived and the majority of cadres, and concentrate our efforts to criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA fighting on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training enthusiastically acclaim the first anniversary of our great leader Chairman Mao's decision to publish the nation's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster. While repeatedly studying "Great Strategic Measure," they seriously summarized the experiences of struggle over the past year. Many soldiers and officers, together with revolutionary masses, recited Chairman Mao's instructions over and over again: Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution. They said: Countless experiences, ten thousand experiences, remembering Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly grasping the direction of struggle is the first experience.

    北京、上海、哈尔滨、贵阳、济南、太原等地的无产阶级革命派和革命群众为纪念毛主席决定发表全国第一张马列主义大字报一周年，纷纷举行庆祝会、座谈会以及规模盛大的庆祝游行。
    北京大学革命师生员工和首都无产阶级革命派以及一百多位外国朋友，今天在北京大学集会，热烈庆祝毛主席决定发表全国第一张马列主义大字报一周年，庆祝以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。北大革命师生员工和首都的无产阶级革命派说，毛主席决定发表北京大学全国第一张马列主义大字报，这是一个伟大的英明的战略措施。在浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军猛烈攻击下，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派陷入了人民战争的汪洋大海之中。一个个资产阶级的顽固堡垒垮台了，大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派被打倒了。这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们表示决心高举革命的批判大旗，按照毛主席指引的方向，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底斗倒斗臭，搞好本单位的斗批改，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。北京起重机厂红色造反者在学习《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》社论《伟大的战略措施》中，回顾了无产阶级文化大革命群众运动一年来的战斗历程和伟大胜利。他们说，毛泽东思想是我们革命胜利的根本保证。我们夺权靠毛泽东思想，我们掌好权也靠毛泽东思想。我们一定要响应毛主席的号召，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。我们要牢记林彪同志的指示，不仅把自己当作革命的一份力量，还要把自己当作革命的对象。我们要用毛泽东思想来改造客观世界，又要用毛泽东思想改造主观世界，永远高高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋勇前进！
    上海广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将说，在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派抛出资产阶级反动路线对无产阶级革命派实行白色恐怖的日子里，最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报，震撼大地，响彻宇宙，给了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的爪牙——大大小小的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以毁灭性的打击，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。现在，嚣张一时的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派终于被揪出来了！他们的资本主义复辟阴谋终于被揭露和粉碎了！“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们坚决按照毛主席指引的斗争大方向，奋勇前进。上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人王秀珍说，我们一定要紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。同时，我们要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，坚决反对无政府主义，在大批判中实现革命的大联合，促进革命的“三结合”。
    山西省革命委员会常委、一·二六纺织厂细纱女工解悦激动地说，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的这一伟大的战略措施，给全党、全国人民指明了无产阶级专政条件下的革命对象、革命道路和方法。一年来的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到，在无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，就是党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派；在社会主义整个历史时期，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的焦点，是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，而资产阶级要颠覆无产阶级专政的斗争。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘一个“权”字，把社会主义革命进行到底，使社会主义红色江山，千秋万代永不变色！全国著名劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰说，目前，我们平顺县的无产阶级革命派已经取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。但是，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。今后，我们更要坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，高举革命的批判旗帜，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮，批深、批透，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    贵州省革命委员会主任委员、贵州省军区政委李再含，在五万人的庆祝大会上说：毛主席最信任群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神，和革命群众心连心。毛主席对于群众创造的新生事物，总是给予大力支持和热烈赞扬。事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众最聪明、最勇敢、最坚强。我们必须把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，要真正把毛泽东思想学到手。贵州省革命委员会常委王运荣在题为《永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远发扬无产阶级革命造反精神》的文章中说，毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，他们每时每刻都企图复辟。我们掌了权的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能忘记无产阶级专政，千万不能忘记突出无产阶级政治，千万不能忘记高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    黑龙江省革命委员会副主任委员、黑龙江军区司令员汪家道在哈尔滨市二十万红色造反者和革命群众参加的集会上讲话说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定发表的全国第一张马列主义的大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，取得了伟大的胜利。毛泽东思想是夺权、掌权和用好权的法宝，是我们的命根子，是防止资本主义复辟的根本保证。我们一定要把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段，掀起新的高潮，把全省各行各业都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。新风加工厂、石油配件厂的革命职工和哈尔滨军事工程学院的红卫兵小将们说，一年以前的今天，毛主席亲自批准发表全国第一张马列主义大字报，有如一声春雷，震撼了全中国，全世界，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席对我们无产阶级革命派的最大关怀、最大支持、最大鼓舞。我们在毛主席的号召下，向资产阶级反动路线发动了猛烈攻击，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从他们手中夺回了党政财文大权。这一切都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们一定要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们彻底批倒、批臭，并肃清其流毒。
    济南市十万革命群众和解放军指战员，举行了集会和游行。山东省革命委员会副主任王竹泉在会上说：我们一定要认真学习毛主席著作，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，把革命的大批判推向一个新的高潮，夺取文化大革命的更大胜利。山东鲁迅大学的小将们回顾一年来的斗争后说，要想紧紧把握斗争的大方向，必须活学活用毛主席著作，敢于横扫自己头脑中的“私”字。他们说，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，每时每刻都在千方百计地企图使我们转移斗争大方向，在我们革命队伍中制造混乱。我们绝不上这个当。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，争取、团结受蒙蔽的群众和团结干部的大多数，集中全力把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭。
    战斗在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训第一线的解放军广大指战员，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席决定发表全国第一张马列主义大字报一周年。他们在反复学习《伟大的战略措施》的同时，认真总结一年来的斗争经验。许多指战员和革命群众一起，一遍又一遍地朗诵毛主席的教导：谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。他们说：千条经验、万条经验，牢记毛主席的这个教导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，是第一条经验。
