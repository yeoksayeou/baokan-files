Fully laden with the profound friendship of the Chinese people for the people of Zambia, President Kaunda leaves Beijing for a visit to Shanghai before returning home.

Premier Zhou En-lai accompanies Zambian friends to Shanghai. Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee holds a grand banquet to welcome President Kaunda.

At the banquet, Premier Zhou En-lai praised the great victories achieved by the working class and revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He hoped that they would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, seize power and use it well, and ensure that our country would never change color.

New China News Agency, June 25th: President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia and his wife, along with other Zambian friends, were accompanied by Premier Zhou En-lai of the State Council and left Beijing this morning to visit Shanghai.

Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Deng Yingchao, Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, and other leading comrades, representatives from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary mass organizations, and thousands of revolutionary people from various sectors went to the airport to see them off.

At around eight o'clock, President Kaunda and Premier Zhou En-lai arrived at the airport, inspected the ceremonial guard composed of the army, navy, air force, militia, and Red Guards, and bade farewell to the revolutionary people of the capital. People waved red-bound copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia!" "Warmly send off President Kaunda!" "Firmly support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

After receiving flowers from the Red Guards, President Kaunda boarded the plane. The people at the airport waved to the Zambian friends, expressing the revolutionary friendship of the revolutionary people of the capital to the people of Zambia.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also present at the airport to see them off.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin and Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Qin Lijin also accompanied the Zambian friends to Shanghai.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, June 25th: President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia, accompanied by Premier Zhou En-lai, arrived in Shanghai this morning by special plane and was warmly welcomed by thousands of revolutionary people from various sectors of Shanghai.

Today, Hongqiao Airport was filled with a spirit of unity and struggle between the peoples of China and Zambia. The national flags of both countries flew high, and countless red flags fluttered in the wind. Giant banners reading "Welcome President Kaunda!" and "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!" hung high on the airport buildings. The revolutionary people who braved the rain to welcome the guests at the airport held red-bound copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," raised high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, and held up portraits of President Kaunda. They repeatedly read "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang revolutionary songs over and over, and were full of revolutionary enthusiasm and high spirits, fully demonstrating the revolutionary passion and lofty internationalism of the revolutionary people of Shanghai.

When the special plane carrying President Kaunda and his wife and other Zambian guests slowly descended, the crowd erupted in cheers and the sound of drums. Leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, responsible comrades of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations went forward to greet the guests who had stepped off the plane, shaking hands warmly. A team of vigorous Red Guards ran up to present the guests with golden copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "All the peoples of the world, unite! Defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world must have courage, dare to fight, be not afraid of difficulties and take a stand in the vanguard. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed!"

Accompanied by Premier Zhou En-lai, President Kaunda came to the welcoming crowd. At this moment, workers, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, and others beat drums, waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted: "Welcome Zambian friends!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia!" "Firmly support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist struggles of the African people!" "Down with U.S.-led imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" The revolutionary people of Shanghai expressed their profound revolutionary friendship to the guests with boundless enthusiasm.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, June 25th: The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a grand banquet this evening to warmly welcome President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia and his wife, as well as all the Zambian friends accompanying President Kaunda on his visit.

Premier Zhou En-lai, who specially accompanied the Zambian friends to Shanghai, attended the banquet.

Tonight, the banquet hall was brightly lit, with a giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao hanging in the center, and red-bound quotations from Chairman Mao hanging around.

At half past seven, when President Kaunda and other Zambian friends and Premier Zhou En-lai entered the banquet hall, they were warmly welcomed by leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee and representatives of revolutionary people from various sectors attending the banquet.

Premier Zhou En-lai spoke at the banquet. He said that during President Kaunda's visit to China, he had already spoken many times, but today, speaking in Shanghai at the request of the revolutionary rebels and Red Guards of Shanghai, had special significance. Because Shanghai is the birthplace of the Communist Party of China and the place where modern industrial workers first emerged and are most concentrated. The working class of Shanghai has a glorious revolutionary tradition and has made significant contributions in China's various great revolutions.

Premier Zhou En-lai especially emphasized that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the working class of Shanghai and various revolutionary mass organizations have once again taken the lead in the struggle, seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, achieving the great victory of the "January Revolution" known throughout the country and the world. Chairman Mao discovered the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism at Peking University last year and recommended it to the whole country, thus igniting the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao this year also discovered the "Letter to All the People of the City" from Shanghai and recommended it to the whole country, bringing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the decisive stage of seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Now, the "January Revolution" in Shanghai is further developing. The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, after seizing power, are carrying out thorough revolutionary criticism, achieving great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in all factories, offices, and units, truly seizing and using power well. In this regard, Shanghai has also set an example for the whole country.

Premier Zhou En-lai hoped that the revolutionary rebels and Red Guards of Shanghai would definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, highlight proletarian politics, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, not only for this generation but also to educate future generations to seize proletarian dictatorship well, ensuring that our country would never change color. Premier Zhou also hoped that as a revolutionary port, Shanghai would generation after generation provide the materials needed by the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as the peoples of the world, supporting their struggles for independence and liberation until the world revolution achieves final victory.

Wang Shaoyong, a comrade of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, proposed a toast at the meeting. He, on behalf of the people of Shanghai and the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, expressed warm welcome to President Kaunda visiting Shanghai at the time of great victory in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that we are deeply convinced that through President Kaunda and the Zambian friends' friendly visit, the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Zambia will be promoted. He proposed a toast to the prosperity and strength of the Republic of Zambia, to the health of President Kaunda and his wife, and to the health of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

President Kaunda proposed a toast at the banquet. He enthusiastically praised the great achievements of socialist construction in Shanghai. He said that today he visited the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, the textile mill, and the steel mill, and saw that the people of Shanghai are playing a great role in the cause of building a great nation in China. The Republic of Zambia is building the steel industry with the spirit of self-reliance. The achievements and efforts of China are a great encouragement to Zambia. In his speech, President Kaunda also praised the model operas that appeared in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which he watched in Beijing—the modern revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl." He said that your achievements and high culture will play a pioneering role in promoting cultural exchanges between China and Zambia.

At the banquet filled with a spirit of unity and friendship, the hosts and guests frequently proposed toasts, drinking to the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia, and to the victory of the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa!

Mrs. Du Bois, a famous black leader, who is visiting Shanghai, was invited to attend the banquet today.

Also present at the banquet were responsible comrades of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, representatives from various departments of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin and Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Qin Lijin, who accompanied the Zambian friends to visit Shanghai, also attended the banquet.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, June 25th: President Kenneth David Kaunda of the Republic of Zambia concluded his visit to China, fully laden with the profound friendship of the Chinese people for the people of Zambia, and left Shanghai by special plane this evening to return home. Premier Zhou En-lai and several thousand revolutionary people from various sectors of Shanghai went to the airport to see him off warmly.

President Kaunda came to China to visit at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China had achieved great victories. During their visit, the Zambian friends saw with their own eyes the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and saw the firm stance of the Chinese people in supporting the oppressed nations and peoples and their deep revolutionary friendship for the African people.

Accompanying President Kaunda on his return were Zambia's Minister of Agriculture Mudenda, Minister of Co-operation, Youth, and Social Development Haydon Banda, Assistant Minister of State for Barotseland Province Monga, Assistant Minister of State for Western Province Chalikulima, Permanent Secretary of the Office of the President and Vice Secretary of the Cabinet Siyomunji, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jona, Chief Private Secretary to the President Ngoma, and Under Secretary of the Ministry of Co-operation, Youth, and Social Development Chisanga, and all the Zambian friends.

After nine o'clock in the evening, President Kaunda and his wife and other Zambian friends arrived at the airport. The joyful crowd erupted in cheers and the sound of drums. They waved red-bound copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically shouting: "Send off President Kaunda!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia!" "Long live the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist struggles of the African people!" "Down with U.S.-led imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" President Kaunda enthusiastically waved to the crowd, bidding them farewell.

Before boarding the plane, President Kaunda shook hands warmly with Premier Zhou En-lai and others, bidding them farewell.

He said, "After the victory of the Chinese revolution, remarkable achievements have been made, and everything we have seen has left a deep impression on us."

    新华社上海二十五日电　赞比亚共和国总统肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达在周恩来总理陪同下，今天上午乘专机从北京到达上海，受到上海各界革命群众数千人的热烈欢迎。
    今天，虹桥机场洋溢着一片中赞两国人民团结战斗的气氛。机场上，中赞两国国旗高高飘扬，无数面红旗迎风招展，机场建筑物上高悬着“欢迎卡翁达总统！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”的巨大横幅。在机场上冒雨迎候贵宾的革命群众，手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举着我们伟大领袖毛主席像，举着卡翁达总统像。他们一次又一次地朗读《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高唱革命歌曲，精神抖擞，斗志昂扬，充分表现了上海市革命人民的革命激情和崇高的国际主义精神。
    当卡翁达总统和他的夫人等赞比亚贵宾乘坐的专机徐徐降落时，人群中爆发出一片欢呼声和锣鼓声。上海市革命委员会负责人、中国人民解放军驻沪部队负责人以及革命群众组织代表迎上前去，和走下专机的贵宾热烈握手。一队朝气蓬勃的红卫兵小将跑上去，向卡翁达总统和全体赞比亚朋友献了金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，并且齐声背诵毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    卡翁达总统在周恩来总理陪同下来到欢迎的群众面前，这时，工人、解放军战士、红卫兵小将等敲起锣鼓，挥动《毛主席语录》，高呼：“欢迎赞比亚朋友！”“中国、赞比亚两国人民的友谊万岁！”“坚决支持亚非拉各国人民的民族解放斗争！”“坚决支持非洲人民的反帝斗争！”“打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“亚非人民团结万岁！”

    新华社上海二十五日电　上海市革命委员会今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎赞比亚共和国总统肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达和夫人，以及随同卡翁达总统来访的全体赞比亚朋友。
    专程陪同赞比亚朋友来上海的周恩来总理出席了宴会。
    今晚，宴会厅里灯火辉煌，大厅正中高悬着我们伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，四周悬挂着红彤彤的毛主席语录牌。
    七时半，卡翁达总统等赞比亚朋友和周恩来总理步入宴会大厅时，受到上海市革命委员会负责同志和出席宴会的各界革命群众代表热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话。他说，他在卡翁达总统访华期间，已作了多次讲话，但是，今天在上海应上海的革命造反派和红卫兵小将们的要求讲话，有着特别的意义。因为上海是中国共产党诞生的地方，是中国近代产业工人产生和最集中的地方。上海的工人阶级有着光荣的革命传统，在我国历次大革命中作出了不少的贡献。
    周恩来总理特别强调说，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，上海的工人阶级和各革命群众组织又站在斗争的前列，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，取得了全国和全世界闻名的“一月革命”的伟大胜利。毛主席去年发现了北京大学的第一张马列主义大字报，把它推荐到全国，从而点起了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。毛主席今年又发现了上海的《告全市人民书》，也把它推荐到全国，使无产阶级文化大革命进入了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的决战阶段。现在，上海的“一月革命”还在进一步深入发展。上海的革命造反派在夺权以后，正在各工厂、各机关、各单位全面地通过革命的大批判，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，要真正地掌好权，用好权。在这方面，上海也给全国作出了榜样。
    周恩来总理希望上海革命造反战士和红卫兵小将们，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，不仅你们这一代，而且还要教育你们的后代掌好无产阶级专政，使我们的国家永不变色。周总理还希望，上海作为一个革命的港口，将世世代代地向亚非拉以及世界各国革命人民提供他们所需要的物资，支援他们争取独立和解放的斗争，直到世界革命取得最后胜利。
    上海市革命委员会王少庸同志在会上祝酒，他代表上海人民和市革命委员会对卡翁达总统在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时候光临上海，表示热烈欢迎。他说，我们深信通过总统阁下和赞比亚朋友的这次友好访问，必将促进中赞两国人民的友谊和团结。他提议为赞比亚共和国的繁荣富强，为卡翁达总统阁下和夫人的健康，为我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的健康，干杯！
    卡翁达总统在宴会上祝酒，他热情地赞扬了上海社会主义建设的伟大成就。他说，我今天参观了上海市工业展览会，访问了纺织厂、钢铁厂，看到了上海人民在发展中国伟大国家的事业中起着很大的作用。赞比亚人民共和国正在以自力更生的精神建设钢铁工业。中国的成就和努力，对赞比亚是很大的鼓舞。卡翁达总统在讲话中还赞扬了他在北京观看的我国无产阶级文化大革命中出现的样板戏——现代革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。他说，你们的成就和高度的文化，在促进中赞两国文化交流方面，将起先锋作用。
    在充满团结友好气氛的宴会上，宾主频频祝酒，为中国赞比亚两国人民的战斗友谊，为亚非各国人民民族解放斗争的胜利而干杯！
    正在上海访问的著名黑人领袖杜波伊斯的夫人，今天应邀出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的，还有中国人民解放军驻上海部队负责人，上海市革命委员会各部门和上海各革命群众组织的代表。
    陪同赞比亚朋友前来上海访问的我国外交部副部长徐以新、中国驻赞比亚大使秦力真也出席了宴会。
    新华社上海二十五日电　赞比亚共和国总统肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达结束了在我国的访问，满载着中国人民对赞比亚人民的深厚友谊，今天晚间乘专机离开上海回国。周恩来总理和上海各界革命群众几千人到机场热烈欢送。
    卡翁达总统是在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中来我国访问的。赞比亚朋友们在访问期间，亲眼看到了用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命精神，看到了我国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成果，看到了中国人民坚决支持被压迫民族和被压迫人民的坚定立场以及对非洲人民的深厚战斗友谊。
    随同卡翁达总统回国的有赞比亚农业部长穆登达，合作、青年和社会发展部长海顿·班达，驻巴罗兹省国务部长蒙加，驻西方省助理国务部长查利库利马，人事办公室常任秘书兼内阁副秘书西约蒙吉，外交部常任秘书乔纳，总统首席私人秘书恩戈马，合作、青年和社会发展部下秘书奇桑加等全体赞比亚朋友。
    晚上九时过后，卡翁达总统和夫人等赞比亚朋友来到机场。欢乐的人群发出了一片欢呼声和锣鼓声，他们挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情地高呼：“欢送卡翁达总统！”“中国赞比亚两国人民的友谊万岁！”“亚非人民团结万岁！”“坚决支持非洲人民的反帝斗争！”“打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”卡翁达总统热情地向欢送的人群频频挥手致意。
