The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought bountiful harvests. The suburbs of Beijing are expecting a bumper wheat harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Qidong have achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on June 3, the frontline of agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing has sent a heartening message: the 2.5 million mu of summer crops that are about to be harvested in the suburbs of Beijing have grown well and are expected to surpass last year's good harvest. According to field comparisons and investigations by many counties, communes, and production brigades, the wheat this year has large ears, and the grains are well-filled. If there are no unusual disasters in the coming days, the yield per unit area of wheat will increase significantly compared to last year.

The sowing and management of summer wheat in the suburbs of Beijing this year have been carried out from start to finish under the impetus and inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and have been done more timely and meticulously than in previous years, creating favorable conditions for a summer harvest. Last autumn, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres in the suburban countryside, with the revolutionary spirit aroused by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, overcame drought and completed the autumn sowing tasks on time and in excess. Since this spring, the broad revolutionary masses in the countryside have launched a great criticism and struggle against the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists under his protection, striving to eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee had pushed in the suburban countryside, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. The broad revolutionary masses and cadres have been vigorously promoting production while focusing on the revolution, implementing water and fertilizer management tailored to local conditions. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, various counties and districts in the suburbs have established and improved the frontline command departments for promoting revolution and production, timely strengthened political and ideological work and production leadership in the countryside, helped a large number of revolutionary cadres stand at the forefront of production, and shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production alongside the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres, doing a great deal of work to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

At present, the broad masses of communes and production brigades in the suburbs are concentrating their efforts on preparing for the summer harvest. The supply and maintenance of agricultural tools and machinery have been basically completed. Revolutionary masses, students, and teachers from various schools, institutions, and military units who have signed up to participate in the "Three Summers" work are also ready to go. A grand battle to harvest the bountiful fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about to be launched throughout the suburbs of Beijing.

Recently, the frontline command department for promoting revolution and production in the suburbs of Beijing held a "Three Summers" work meeting to deploy the summer harvest, summer sowing, and summer grain procurement work. The meeting pointed out that the "Three Summers" work in the suburban countryside should be regarded as a political battle, and it is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The more busy we are, the more we must highlight proletarian politics, resolutely place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the "Three Summers" work. We must firmly believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres, and strive to complete the arduous tasks of the "Three Summers" work.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on June 3, amidst the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the famous high-yield county of Jiangsu Province, Qidong County, has sent news of a bumper harvest of summer crops. At present, the more than 600,000 mu of wheat and barley in the entire county have been harvested. From the production figures of many communes and production brigades, it can be seen that the yield of summer crops this year will be even higher than the bumper harvest year of 1966. This is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Qidong County has further carried out the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production through studying Chairman Mao's works.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have criticized the capitalist reactionary line on the cadre issue, actively encouraged revolutionary cadres to bravely take on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production; many revolutionary cadres have further believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and respected the masses' initiative. Every time a task is arranged, the masses are always mobilized to discuss democratically, listen to the opinions and demands of the masses, and concentrate the wisdom and strength of the masses to guide production. The bumper harvest of summer crops in Qidong County is also inseparable from the great support of the army. Just as the spring plowing is about to begin, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army actively responded to the call of the Central Military Commission to support the local spring plowing production, rushed to various communes and production brigades, helped to establish and improve the production command system, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, studied Chairman Mao's works, focused on the masses' active thoughts, and promoted the thought revolutionization of the members.

    无产阶级文化大革命带来了丰硕成果
    京郊小麦丰收在望
    启东广大贫下中农和革命干部夺得夏熟作物大丰收
    据新华社三日讯　北京市郊区农业生产第一线传来了振奋人心的好消息：北京郊区二百五十万亩即将开镰收割的夏收作物，长势普遍良好，可望获得超过去年的好收成。据不少县、社、大队田间评比调查证明，今年小麦穗大，籽粒灌浆较好，近些天如不遇特殊灾害，小麦单位面积产量将比去年有较大幅度增长。
    北京郊区今年夏收小麦的播种和管理，自始至终都是在无产阶级文化大革命的推动、鼓舞下进行的，搞得比往年更及时、更细致，为夏季丰收创造了有利条件。去年秋天，郊区农村广大革命群众和革命干部，以在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的革命干劲，战胜天旱，适时超额完成了秋播任务。今春以来，广大农村无产阶级革命派对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其庇护下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，展开了大批判、大斗争，努力肃清旧北京市委在郊区农村推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，进一步调动了群众积极性。广大革命群众和革命干部，狠抓革命，猛促生产，因地制宜地加强了小麦水肥管理。在人民解放军大力支援下，郊区各县、区建立和健全了各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，及时加强了农村中的政治思想工作和生产领导，帮助大批革命干部站到生产最前线，同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一道担起革命、生产两副重担，为夺取革命生产双胜利做了大量工作。
    现在郊区广大社队正在集中全力做好夏收准备工作。农具供应、机具检修工作业已大体就绪。各学校、机关、部队报名参加“三夏”工作的革命群众，革命师生，解放军指战员和革命干部，也整装待发。一场收获无产阶级文化大革命丰硕果实的大会战，即将在北京郊区全面展开。
    最近，北京市抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，召开了“三夏”工作会议，部署夏收、夏种和夏粮征购工作。会议指出，要把郊区农村的“三夏”工作当作一场政治仗来打，一定要按照毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，越忙越要突出无产阶级政治，坚决把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，以毛泽东思想统帅“三夏”工作，坚决相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数，努力完成“三夏”工作的繁重任务。
    据新华社南京三日电　在无产阶级文化大革命进入革命大批判的高潮中，著名的粮棉高产县江苏启东县传来了夏熟作物大丰收的喜讯。目前，全县六十多万亩元麦和大麦，已经收割完毕。从许多社队核产的情况看，今年夏收作物的产量将比大丰收的一九六六年还要增加。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果。
    启东县自开展无产阶级文化大革命运动以来，进一步展开了学习毛主席著作的群众运动。广大贫下中农和革命干部通过学习毛主席著作，生产积极性空前高涨。
    广大贫下中农批判了在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，积极鼓励革命干部，勇敢地站出来挑起革命、生产两副重担；许多革命干部，更加相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。每安排一项工作，总要发动群众民主讨论，听取群众的意见和要求，集中群众的智慧和力量来指导生产。启东县夏熟作物大丰收，和解放军的巨大支援也是分不开的。正当春耕生产即将到来的关键时刻，人民解放军指战员积极响应中央军委关于军队大力支援地方抓好春耕生产的号召，纷纷奔赴各社队，帮助建立和健全生产指挥系统，同广大贫下中农和革命干部一道学习毛主席著作，大抓群众的活思想，促进社员的思想革命化。
