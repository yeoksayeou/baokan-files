Zambian President K. Kaunda and his wife, along with other Zambian friends, attended a welcoming cultural evening hosted by the Foreign Affairs Commission and the China-Africa Friendship Association tonight, where they watched the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl."

Premier Zhou Enlai, along with Li Xiannian, Deng Yingchao, Zhang Zaiwu, Xu Yixin, Chu Tu'nan, Ding Xilin, and Qin Lijin, accompanied them to watch the performance.

The Zambian friends applauded enthusiastically throughout the performance. During the intermission, President Kaunda and his wife met with some of the performers and had a cordial conversation, praising their excellent performance.

The Zambian government's economic and technical cooperation delegation, which is currently visiting China, was also invited to the evening event.

Zambian President K. Kaunda and other Zambian friends, accompanied by Vice Minister of National Defense Wang Shusheng, visited a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison today and were warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers.

When President Kaunda arrived at the camp, the officers and soldiers lined up at the camp gate, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, and shouted slogans: "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The officers and soldiers held a welcoming rally for President Kaunda in the camp. The unit leaders introduced the glorious fighting history of the unit, saying that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a people's army created and led by Chairman Mao. Every victory achieved by the PLA is a victory of the great thought of Mao Zedong. All officers and soldiers of our unit resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm their minds with Mao Zedong thought, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and are ready to strike any enemy that dares to invade. We firmly support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The active learners of Chairman Mao's works also shared their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the Zambian friends. The Zambian friends listened with great interest and applauded enthusiastically.

At the welcoming rally, the unit comrades also presented Chairman Mao badges, Chairman Mao quotations, and "Selected Military Works of Mao Zedong" to the Zambian friends. After wearing the Chairman Mao badges, President Kaunda shook hands with the unit leaders and repeatedly expressed his thanks.

Subsequently, President Kaunda and the Zambian friends inspected various weapons of the unit and watched military demonstrations such as rifle shooting, grenade throwing, bayonet combat, mortar firing, and engineering operations. The officers and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong thought, received high praise from the Zambian friends for their performances. President Kaunda told the soldiers, "Your performance has left a deep impression on me. I wish you greater achievements under the leadership of Chairman Mao."
