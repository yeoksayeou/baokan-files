Egyptian people from all walks of life have been vehemently denouncing the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the Arab people's interests during the war of aggression by the U.S., Britain, and Israel against Arab countries, accusing them of acting as the U.S. imperialists' number one accomplice.

One Egyptian friend said: "We are beginning to see who our true friends are, that is the people of China; and who our false friends are, that is the Soviet Union."

An Egyptian journalist said: "We will never forget the Soviet Union's betrayal of our anti-aggression struggle." He said: "All Arabs will never forget this great betrayal by Soviet revisionism. We are beginning to understand everything that China has said about Soviet revisionism, and China's stance towards them is correct."

An intellectual said: "There is an Arab proverb: someone promised to give you an earring, but when you have already pierced your ear, they do not give you the earring. This is what the Soviet Union has done to us."

A shopkeeper said: "We are very angry. We know that the U.S., Britain, and Israel are our enemies, but Russia (referring to the Soviet revisionists) is too bad, it betrayed us in the struggle."

A driver asked: "During the fighting, where was Russia? They did not do what they did during the Cuban crisis, even worse. We will never forget and forgive them."

A security guard said: "When our Minister of Defense visited Moscow, the Soviet Union promised to give us weapons to fight against Israel, but once we started resisting the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel, they did nothing, just saying that they want peace. What kind of peace! They are too bad."

While denouncing the Soviet revisionists' betrayal, the Egyptian people have enthusiastically praised the people of China, under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, for their firm support of the Egyptian and other Arab peoples' struggle against the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel. The newspapers *Al-Jumhuriya* and *Al-Akhbar* both published on June 10th the telegrammed photos of the demonstration march in Beijing in support of the Arab people's just struggle.

These two days, when Chinese reporters walked through the demonstration crowds in Cairo, people enthusiastically waved and shouted: "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong! Long live the People's Republic of China!"

A worker said: "China always helps us in times of difficulty. China sincerely supports the struggle of the Algerian people, the Palestinian people, the Yemeni people, and other Arab peoples, and it is now helping the Vietnamese people fight against U.S. imperialism. China is the true friend of the oppressed peoples of the world."

    中国是世界被压迫人民的真正朋友
    新华社开罗十日电  阿联各界人士纷纷痛斥苏修领导集团在美、英、以侵略阿拉伯国家的战争中出卖阿拉伯人民利益，充当美帝头号帮凶。
    一位阿联朋友说：“我们开始认识到，谁是我们的真朋友，那就是人民中国；谁是我们的假朋友，那就是苏联。”
    一位阿联新闻工作者说：“我们绝不会忘记（苏联）出卖我们反侵略斗争的行为。”他说：所有阿拉伯人都不会忘记苏联修正主义的这一次的大叛卖行为。“我们开始懂得中国所说的关于苏联修正主义的一切，中国对他们采取的立场是正确的。”
    一位知识分子说：“有个阿拉伯谚语说：本来答应要给人家耳环，但是当人家把耳朵穿好了孔，却又不把耳环拿来了。这就是苏联对我们干的事。”
    一位店员说：“我们非常愤怒，我们知道美英和以色列是我们的敌人，但是俄国（指苏修）太坏了，它在斗争中出卖了我们。”
    一个司机问道：“在战斗期间，俄国在那里，他们干了在古巴危机期间所干的事，甚至更坏。我们决不会忘记和饶恕他们。”
    一个保安人员说：“在我们的国防部长访问莫斯科时，苏联答应给我们武器来同以色列战斗，但是一旦我们开始抗击美英以侵略的时候，他们什么也不干，只是说，他们要和平。什么样的和平！他们太坏了。”
    阿联人民在痛斥苏修叛卖行径的同时，热烈赞扬在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的中国人民对阿联和其他阿拉伯国家人民反抗美英以侵略的坚决支持。《共和国报》和《消息报》十日都登了北京市举行示威游行，支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争的传真照片。
    这两天，当中国记者在开罗走过游行队伍的时候，人们热情地挥手高呼：“毛泽东、毛泽东！”“人民中国万岁！”
    一位工人说：“中国总是在困难的时候帮助我们。中国真诚地支持阿尔及利亚人民、巴勒斯坦人民、也门人民和其他阿拉伯人民的斗争，它现在正在帮助越南人民同美帝国主义战斗。中国是世界被压迫人民的真朋友。”
