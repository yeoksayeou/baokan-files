Nearly 100,000 in Guangzhou Protest Against New Crimes of British Authorities in Hong Kong
Firmly Support Hong Kong Compatriots' Resolute Struggle Against Violence

	GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) — The British authorities in Hong Kong's "June 8" new bloody suppression of Hong Kong patriots has infuriated the revolutionary masses in the Guangzhou area. This morning, nearly 100,000 revolutionary masses in Guangzhou held a rally and a demonstration march, angrily denouncing the British authorities' heinous crimes and expressing their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, to join hands with Hong Kong patriots to thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

	The chairman of the meeting pointed out in his speech that the British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding the repeated serious warnings of the Chinese government, have decided to be enemies of the seven hundred million Chinese people and the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon. On June 8, they again sent out a large number of "riot police" to carry out more brutal fascist suppression against the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, attempting to suppress the great struggle of Hong Kong patriots against the atrocities of British imperialism. This is nothing but a pipe dream! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that in dealing with imperialism and all reactionaries, our policy is to meet force with force and to fight resolutely. For the various persecutions of British imperialism against our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, we must give them a double blow in return.

	An old worker who participated in the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike spoke enthusiastically at the meeting about the heroic deeds of Hong Kong patriots in their struggle against persecution. He said, the working class and compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon have inherited the glorious revolutionary tradition of the world-famous Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike, forming a vast revolutionary army to fight tenaciously against British imperialism. I am proud of the heroic struggle of Hong Kong patriots. He said, forty-two years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we workers dared to fight resolutely against British imperialism and launched the famous Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike. No matter how brutally British imperialism suppressed and massacred, hundreds of thousands of striking workers remained united under the Party's leadership, launching a powerful counterattack against British imperialism, and finally achieved victory. Now, the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are even more formidable. If you insist on going your own way, you will only end up with a bloody nose in front of the great Chinese people and the heroic Hong Kong patriots.

	The militia from the suburbs of Guangzhou, San Yuan Li, said at the meeting, more than a hundred years ago, our revolutionary people of San Yuan Li had already taught British imperialism a lesson. In 1841, our brave San Yuan Li anti-British militia, holding up the anti-imperialist banner, wielding big knives, spears, and sticks, fought against the British imperialists armed with guns and cannons, making them flee in defeat. Today, the rotten-to-the-core British imperialists have forgotten the lessons of their past defeats, carrying out bloody suppression against Hong Kong patriots, and provoking the great Chinese people. We are the heroic descendants of the anti-British militia and the revolutionary youth militia of the Mao Zedong era. We are ready to respond to the call of our great motherland at any time, to support Hong Kong patriots in smashing the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

	The Red Guards and the sailors and workers on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, as well as the union workers expelled from the Hong Kong Kowloon Dockyard by the British authorities, also spoke at the meeting.

	After the meeting, a grand demonstration march was held. (with pictures)

    广州近十万人示威声讨港英当局新罪行
    坚决支持香港同胞针锋相对的抗暴斗争
    据新华社广州十一日电　港英当局制造“六·八”新的血腥镇压香港爱国同胞的事件，激怒了广州地区的广大革命群众。今天上午，广州近十万革命群众举行集会和示威游行，愤怒声讨港英当局的滔天罪行，表示随时准备响应祖国的号召，同香港爱国同胞一道，彻底粉碎英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。
    大会主持人在发言中指出，港英当局不顾我国政府的多次严重警告，决心与七亿中国人民和港九同胞为敌，于六月八日又出动大批“防暴队”，用更残暴的法西斯手段，对港九同胞进行血腥镇压，妄想把香港爱国同胞这一场伟大的反对英帝国主义的暴行的斗争镇压下去，这完全是白日作梦！我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们，对付帝国主义和一切反动派，我们的方针是针锋相对，坚决斗争。对于英帝国主义对我港九同胞的种种迫害，我们一定要给予加倍的回击。
    曾经参加过省港大罢工的老工人在会上热烈赞扬香港爱国同胞反迫害斗争的英雄行为。他说，港九工人阶级和同胞继承了举世闻名的省港大罢工的光荣革命传统，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，同英帝国主义进行了英勇顽强的斗争，我为港九爱国同胞的这种英勇斗争而感到自豪。他说，四十二年前，我们工人阶级在中国共产党的领导下，就敢于同英帝国主义进行坚决斗争，举行了有名的省港大罢工，不管英帝国主义怎样残暴地镇压和屠杀，几十万罢工工人始终团结在党的周围，向英帝国主义展开强大的反击，最后终于取得了胜利。现在，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和港九爱国同胞更是不好惹的。如果你们硬要一意孤行，只能在伟大的中国人民面前，在英勇斗争的港九爱国同胞面前，碰得头破血流。
    广州郊区三元里的民兵在会上说，一百多年前，我们三元里的革命人民早就教训过英帝国主义。一八四一年，我英勇的三元里平英团农民，高举反帝大旗，紧握大刀、长矛、木棍，就打得用洋枪、洋炮武装起来的英帝国主义丢盔弃甲，屁滚尿流。今天，腐朽透顶的英帝国主义忘记了历史上惨败的教训，血腥镇压港九爱国同胞，向伟大的中国人民挑衅。我们是平英团的英雄后代，是毛泽东时代的革命青年民兵，我们随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，支持香港爱国同胞粉碎英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。
    红卫兵小将和航行在广州—香港航线的海员工人、被港英当局驱逐出境的前香港九龙船坞的工会工作者等也都在会上讲了话。
