Albanian cadres and masses continue to enthusiastically celebrate the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which Chairman Mao personally initiated and led, over the past year.

	Secretary of the Albanian Trade Union Central Council, Idriz Drami, recently told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that the Albanian working people continue to watch with admiration the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is being successfully carried out under the personal leadership of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong.

	He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has smashed the conspiracy of revisionist elements attempting to make the Communist Party of China deviate from the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line, blocked the road to the restoration of capitalism in China, united the laboring masses more closely around the great Communist Party of China and the glorious leader Mao Zedong, and accelerated the pace of socialist construction.

	Drami emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has extremely important international significance. It shows how to prevent revisionists from usurping power, and how revolutionary masses should go about overthrowing them after they have usurped power.

	Teachers and students of the Frasheri Middle School in Tirana have, over the past year, eagerly followed the victorious progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China through reading newspapers, listening to radio broadcasts, inviting comrades who have returned from visits to China to give reports, and holding discussion meetings.

	A responsible comrade from this school said, the Red Guards' heroic revolutionary actions in China have left a deep impression on us. We will fight side by side with the Chinese youth until Marxism-Leninism achieves complete victory throughout the world.

	Vjollca Ngjela, a standing member of the Central Council of the Albanian Women's Union, recently told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, have immense, comprehensive, and historic significance.

	She pointed out that the People's Republic of China is a major bastion of socialism and the strongest supporter of the world revolutionary movement. Therefore, the great achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made a tremendous contribution to strengthening the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership, and to strengthening the struggle of the peoples of all countries for national liberation and the victory of socialism.

	Salichai, an engineer from the "Stalin Textile Combine" weaving workshop who recently returned from a visit to China, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. As long as classes exist, political struggles between them are inevitable. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has defeated the class enemies attempting to restore capitalism in China and a handful of power-holders within the Party who have usurped power and stubbornly pursued a bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is increasingly and better grasped by workers, peasants, and the broad masses of the people.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民欢呼我国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    毛主席的革命路线深入人心
    据新华社地拉那电  阿尔巴尼亚广大干部和群众，继续热烈欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命一年来取得的伟大胜利。
    阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会书记伊德里兹·德拉米最近对新华社记者发表谈话说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民，继续以钦佩的心情注视着由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席亲自领导的正在顺利开展着的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了企图使中国共产党脱离马克思列宁主义革命路线的修正主义分子的阴谋，堵塞了资本主义在中国复辟的道路，把劳动群众更紧密地团结在伟大的中国共产党和光荣的领袖毛泽东同志周围，并且加快了社会主义建设的速度。
    德拉米强调指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命具有非常重要的国际意义。它指出了应当怎样防止修正主义者篡夺政权，指出了在修正主义者篡夺政权之后，革命群众应当怎样去打倒他们。
    都拉斯市弗拉歇里中学的师生，一年来怀着极其迫切的心情，通过读报、听广播、请访问中国归来的同志作报告、举行座谈会等形式，注视着中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展。
    这个学校的一位负责同志说，中国红卫兵英勇的革命行动给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们将同中国青年并肩战斗，直到马克思列宁主义在全世界取得完全胜利为止。
    阿尔巴尼亚妇女联合会中央理事会常务理事薇·恩杰拉最近对新华社记者说，毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就具有巨大的、全面的、历史性的重要意义。
    她指出，中华人民共和国是社会主义的主要堡垒，是世界革命运动最强大的支持者。因此，中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大成就，为加强反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，为加强全世界各国人民争取民族解放、社会主义的胜利的斗争，作出了巨大的贡献。
    最近访问中国回国的“斯大林纺织联合工厂”织布工场工程师萨利查伊说，在中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场无产阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争，只要还存在阶级，它们之间的政治斗争就不可避免。中国无产阶级文化大革命打垮了企图在中国进行资本主义复辟的阶级敌人，打垮了一小撮钻进党内窃取了政权、顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线的当权派。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，正日益和更好地为工人、农民和广大的人民群众所掌握。
