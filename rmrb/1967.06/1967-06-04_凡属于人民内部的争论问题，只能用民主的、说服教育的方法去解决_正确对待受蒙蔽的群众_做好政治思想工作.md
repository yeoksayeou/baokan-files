All issues within the people's internal debates should be resolved through democratic and persuasive educational methods. Correctly handle those who have been deceived among the masses and do good political and ideological work.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory strictly follows the teachings of Chairman Mao, enthusiastically helping the deceived workers, uniting the majority of the masses, and concentrating their efforts to strike at the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory, following Chairman Mao's teaching to pay attention to uniting all those who can be united, actively and enthusiastically helps and wins over the deceived workers, uniting the majority of the masses. As a result, more than 80% of the workers in the factory have joined a unified revolutionary mass organization. Many workers who have not yet joined the revolutionary mass organization have also united around the revolutionary "three-in-one" provisional power organ—the Factory Revolutionary Committee. Therefore, the proletarian cultural revolution in this factory is being carried out vigorously, and production is booming.

Focus on the main contradiction, focus on the big direction.

During the proletarian cultural revolution, two types of mass organizations emerged in this factory. One is the proletarian revolutionary faction organization that emerged from the white terror from the bottom up—the Mao Zedong Thought Combat Team and the Worker-Student Combat Team. The other is the "Worker Patrol Team," an organization orchestrated behind the scenes by a handful of capitalists within the party who are in power.

To win over the deceived masses, the proletarian revolutionary faction once discussed with the leaders of the "Worker Patrol Team," hoping that the two factions would unite and jointly fight against the enemy. However, things did not go as planned. When the factory criticized the capitalist reactionary line, the revolutionary faction went on stage to criticize, but the deceived "Worker Patrol Team" caused trouble from the audience.

How to resolve the contradiction between the proletarian revolutionary faction and the "Worker Patrol Team"?

Chairman Mao said: "In the complex process of the development of things, there are many contradictions, among which there must be one that is the principal contradiction. Its existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of other contradictions."

In the proletarian cultural revolution, the main contradiction to be resolved is the contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power. This is a contradiction between the enemy and us. Resolving this principal contradiction means directing the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power. This is the big direction. The revolutionary faction of the Red Star Tractor Factory deeply realized from the practice of struggle that only by firmly grasping this direction of struggle, thoroughly exposing the anti-party and anti-socialist crimes of the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power, and thoroughly criticizing the capitalist reactionary line they actively promote, can the deceived comrades see the situation clearly, draw the line, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The process of raising the awareness of the deceived old worker Qiu Guomin in this factory vividly illustrates this point.

Qiu Guomin is an old worker and a Communist Party member in the machinery repair workshop. He has an unlimited love for the party and Chairman Mao, is always serious and responsible in production, and has been rated as a production model for the entire factory many times. In this cultural revolution, due to the influence of the slave mentality instilled by the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power in the past, he did not understand the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary faction for a while and sometimes even felt very resentful. The handful of capitalists within the party who are in power in the factory seized Qiu Guomin's weakness of being temporarily lost and pulled him into the "Worker Patrol Team," even making him the squad leader, using him as a "banner" to deceive other masses. When the revolutionary faction of this factory launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power and the capitalist reactionary line they implement, they fully exposed the numerous crimes of these bad guys and also exposed their various vile means of deceiving and using old workers like Qiu Guomin. They seemed to value Qiu Guomin very much, but at the same time, they also compiled "black materials" on Qiu Guomin, preparing to deal with him when Qiu Guomin "defected." Under these circumstances, Qiu Guomin finally, with the help of the revolutionary faction, drew the line, raised his awareness, and firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary faction, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Under the influence of Qiu Guomin, many deceived workers also woke up and successively withdrew from the "Worker Patrol Team."

After the important article "Patriotism or Treason?" was published, the revolutionary faction of this factory, in conjunction with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory, launched a general offensive against the number one capitalist within the party who is in power. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory held seven or eight factory-wide criticism meetings. Various workshops and departments also held criticism meetings. The revolutionary faction paid special attention to giving the deceived workers more opportunities to speak. Some deceived workers eagerly took the stage to angrily denounce the harm caused by the capitalist reactionary line and "Cultivation" proposed by the number one capitalist within the party who is in power.

Through multiple criticism meetings, the revolutionary workers more clearly realized that the deceived class brothers are the victims of the biggest handful of capitalists within the party who are in power and the capitalist reactionary line they propose. They should unite with them to fight together.

The revolutionary faction must do ideological work for everyone.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Pay attention to uniting all those who can be united. He also teaches us: We must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself.

The revolutionary faction of the Red Star Tractor Factory deeply feels that if someone does not enthusiastically strive to win over, educate, and unite the deceived masses, helping them to liberate themselves from the capitalist reactionary line, it shows that he does not have the great heart of "liberating all of humanity." He is not a true and complete proletarian revolutionary. Everyone in this factory's revolutionary faction takes action, using various methods, to do meticulous and painstaking political and ideological work for the deceived comrades.

Delivering Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest help the revolutionary faction can give to the deceived comrades. The young fighters of the Worker-Student Combat Team, on New Year's Day this year, bought Chairman Mao's portraits, wrote quotations from Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, braved the bitter cold, and traveled more than ten miles back and forth, delivering Chairman Mao's portraits and quotations from Chairman Mao to the homes of the deceived workers. Many workers were deeply moved.

Some revolutionary fighters, with deep class feelings, patiently helped the deceived workers without tiring. The production team leader Chen Shaoguan of the forging and pressing workshop had three conversations with a deceived old worker, each time encountering a rebuff, but he remained very patient. The fourth time, he talked about the bitterness of the past before liberation and the sweetness after liberation, discussed the great significance of the current proletarian cultural revolution in our country, and used a large amount of facts to explain that the "Worker Patrol Team" is a conservative organization. Seeing that his class brother was helping him so patiently, the old worker was so moved that he shed tears. Soon, he resolutely withdrew from the "Worker Patrol Team" and joined the revolutionary mass organization.

When doing ideological work, the revolutionary faction always remembers Chairman Mao's teaching: "Communist Party members' attitude towards backward people is not to look down on them, despise them, but to be close to them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." Therefore, they approach the deceived comrades with a sincere and enthusiastic attitude, without ridicule or sarcasm. This has played a significant role in eliminating hostile sentiments and uniting and winning over the deceived comrades.

The revolutionary faction must set an example for everyone.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory deeply understands that to unite the majority of the masses, they must set an example for the masses in all aspects.

First, they require themselves to take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Now, each workshop in this factory has established an unbreakable system for studying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary faction of the forging and pressing workshop has established a system of "three things before class." These three things are: studying Chairman Mao's quotations, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations; arranging the day's production tasks and safety precautions; praising good people and good deeds. Now, the first big thing they do every day before work is to study Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Old Three Articles" in connection with their thoughts and the actual struggle.

Second, the proletarian revolutionary faction requires itself to be a model in implementing the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." When the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power incited some of the masses in the "Worker Patrol Team" to leave their production posts, the revolutionary workers always stayed at their production posts. Sometimes, because they had to attend meetings, they missed production and made up for it later. Sometimes, the day shift comrades attended meetings, and the night shift comrades worked double shifts. After the deceived workers left their production posts, the revolutionary faction took over their shifts.

Third, the proletarian revolutionary faction must be a model in maintaining internal unity, which is an important link in winning over the masses. Without internal unity, it is impossible to talk about winning over the masses. To strengthen the unity of the revolutionary faction, they often carry out small rectification movements, timely correcting various erroneous thoughts that hinder unity.

Fourth, they give convenience to others and leave difficulties for themselves, setting an example of selflessness. When a handful of capitalists within the factory who are in power were promoting economism and using "high-temperature subsidies" to tempt the revolutionary faction, they gave these bad guys a hard blow, returning the several hundred yuan of "high-temperature subsidies" given to each person! After the proletarian revolutionary faction united to seize power from the handful of capitalists within the party who are in power and took control of the factory, when distributing living allowances to workers in the factory who have difficulties, the revolutionary faction voluntarily gave the allowances to workers who have difficulties and were deceived into joining the conservative organization. Their selfless and lofty style deeply moved the deceived comrades.

The revolutionary faction sets an example in everything and sets a model in every aspect, making the deceived comrades admire them from the heart. They say that the revolutionary faction is resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In this way, it more quickly helps them to see the direction clearly and join the revolutionary faction.

    凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的、说服教育的方法去解决
    正确对待受蒙蔽的群众　做好政治思想工作
    贵州红星拖拉机厂无产阶级革命派紧紧遵循毛主席的教导，热情帮助受蒙蔽的职工，团结大多数群众，集中火力打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    贵州红星拖拉机厂的无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席的要注意团结一切可以团结的人们的教导，积极热情地帮助和争取受蒙蔽的职工，团结大多数群众，使全厂百分之八十以上的职工参加了统一的革命群众组织，许多还没有参加革命群众组织的职工也团结在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——厂革命委员会的周围。因此，这个厂的无产阶级文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。
      抓主要矛盾，抓大方向
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂出现了两种群众组织。一种是自下而上从白色恐怖中“杀”出来的无产阶级革命派组织——毛泽东思想战斗队和学工战斗队；另一种是由党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在幕后策划的保字号组织——“工人纠察队”。
    为了争取受蒙蔽的群众，无产阶级革命派曾经找“工人纠察队”的负责人商谈，希望两派组织团结一致，共同对敌。但是，事与愿违。厂里批判资产阶级反动路线时，革命派上台批判，受蒙蔽的“工人纠察队”却在台下捣乱。
    如何解决无产阶级革命派和“工人纠察队”之间的矛盾呢？
    毛主席说：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，要解决的主要矛盾是无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，这种矛盾是敌我矛盾，解决这个主要矛盾，就是要把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这就是大方向。红星拖拉机厂的革命派从斗争实践中深刻地认识到，只有紧紧掌握这个斗争的大方向，彻底揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义的罪行，彻底批判他们积极推行的资产阶级反动路线，才能够使受蒙蔽的同志看清形势，划清界限，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    这个厂受蒙蔽的老工人邱国民提高觉悟的过程，生动地说明了这个道理。
    邱国民是工修车间的老工人、共产党员，他对党和毛主席无限热爱，生产上一贯认真负责，多次被评为全厂的生产模范。在这次文化大革命中，他由于受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派过去灌输的奴隶主义思想的影响，对革命派的造反精神一时认识不清，有时甚至很反感。厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派抓住邱国民一时迷失方向的弱点，把他拉进“工人纠察队”，还让他当了中队长，利用他当“招牌”去蒙蔽其他群众。这个厂的革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及他们所执行的资产阶级反动路线展开猛烈进攻的时候，充分揭发了这些坏家伙的大量罪行，同时也揭露了他们蒙蔽和利用邱国民等老工人的种种卑劣手段。他们一方面好象很“器重”邱国民，同时又整了邱国民的“黑材料”，准备有一天邱国民“倒戈”的时候好整他。在这种情况下，邱国民终于在革命派的帮助下划清了界限，提高了觉悟，坚定地站到革命派一边，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    在邱国民的影响下，许多受蒙蔽的职工也醒悟过来，纷纷退出了“工人纠察队”。
    《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇重要文章发表后，这个厂的革命派结合厂内的斗批改，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起了总攻击。在革命委员会的领导下，全厂革命职工连续举行了七、八次全厂性的批判大会。各车间科室也分别举行了批判会。会上，革命派很注意多给受蒙蔽的职工发言的机会。一些受蒙蔽的工人争相上台，愤怒控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线和《修养》对他们的毒害。
    通过多次批判大会，革命派工人更加认识到受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们提出的资产阶级反动路线的受害者，应该团结他们共同战斗。
             革命派要人人做思想工作
    毛主席教导我们：要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。还教导我们：必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。
    红星拖拉机厂的革命派深深地体会到，谁如果不满腔热情地去争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众，使他们从资产阶级反动路线下解放出来，那就表明他没有“解放全人类”的伟大胸怀，他就不是一个真正的完全的无产阶级革命派。这个厂的革命派人人动手，运用各种方式，对受蒙蔽的同志进行了艰苦细致的政治思想工作。
    送毛泽东思想，这是革命派对受蒙蔽同志的最大帮助。学工战斗队的革命小将们，在今年的元旦节日里，买了毛主席像，写了毛主席语录，敲锣打鼓，冒着凛冽的寒风，来回十余里，挨家挨户地把毛主席像和毛主席语录送到受蒙蔽的工人家里。许多工人都十分感动。
    有的革命派战士怀着深厚的阶级感情，不厌其烦地对受蒙蔽的职工进行耐心帮助。锻压车间生产班长陈绍全，找一个受蒙蔽的老工人谈心，接连碰了三次钉子，他仍然非常耐心。第四次，他从解放前的苦摆到翻身后的甜，从苏联产生修正主义谈到当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，并且用大量事实说明“工人纠察队”是个保字号组织。这位老工人看到阶级兄弟这样耐心的帮助自己，激动得流出了眼泪。不久，他就毅然地退出了“工人纠察队”，参加了革命群众组织。
    革命派做思想工作时，都牢记着毛主席的这一教导：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”因此，他们和受蒙蔽的同志接触，都抱着热情诚恳的态度，不讽刺，不挖苦。这对消除对立情绪，团结和争取受蒙蔽的同志，起了很大作用。
                革命派要人人起模范作用
    贵州红星拖拉机厂的无产阶级革命派深深懂得，要想团结大多数群众，必须自己在各个方面为群众树立榜样。
    首先，他们要求自己带头活学活用毛主席著作。现在，这个厂各个车间都建立了雷打不散的学习毛主席著作的制度。锻压车间的革命派建立了“班前三件事”的制度。这三件事是：学毛主席著作，唱毛主席语录歌；布置当天生产任务和安全注意事项；表扬好人好事。现在，他们每天上班前的第一件大事，就是联系思想实际和斗争实际，学习毛主席语录，学习“老三篇”。
    第二，无产阶级革命派要求自己成为贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针的模范。当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽动“工人纠察队”中一部分群众离开生产岗位的时候，革命派工人始终坚守生产岗位。有时他们因为必须开会，耽误了生产，也找时间补班。有时上日班的同志开会，夜班的同志就连顶两个班。受蒙蔽的工人离开生产岗位以后，革命派就顶班干。
    第三，无产阶级革命派要做搞好内部团结的模范，这是争取团结群众的重要一环。内部不团结，就根本谈不上去争取群众。他们为了加强革命派的团结，经常开展小整风，及时纠正各种妨碍团结的错误思想。
    第四，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，做大公无私的模范。当厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大搞经济主义，用“高温补贴”来诱惑革命派的时候，他们给这些坏家伙当头一棒，把发给每人几百元的“高温补贴”顶了回去！而当无产阶级革命派联合起来夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权、掌握了工厂的印把子以后，在给厂里生活上有困难的职工发生活困难补助费时，革命派却把补助费主动让给生活上有困难的、因受蒙蔽而参加过保字号组织的职工。他们这种大公无私的崇高风格，使受蒙蔽的同志深受感动。
    革命派事事做模范，处处树立榜样，使受蒙蔽的同志从心里佩服。他们说，革命派是坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。这样，就更快地促使他们认清了方向，投身到革命派队伍中来。
