From the battlefields of Vietnam, a series of exhilarating victories have been reported. The military and civilian population of South Vietnam have shattered the U.S. aggressors' "second dry season offensive," annihilating over 170,000 enemy troops in seven months. The military and civilian population of North Vietnam have shot down the 2,000th U.S. aggressor aircraft, shattering the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing to force negotiations." The glorious victories in the South and North complement each other, composing a new triumphant song of people's war. The 700 million people of China enthusiastically cheer the new victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and extend their heartfelt congratulations.

The new great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people have most powerfully proven that: on today's battlefields of Vietnam, the true strong ones are not the U.S. imperialists, but the heroic Vietnamese people. The U.S. imperialists, despite their "strong soldiers and sharp weapons," have been desperately carrying out "bombing the North and attacking the South," but they cannot escape increasingly heavy defeats. The Vietnamese people, although inferior in weapons and equipment, have seized the initiative and are fighting stronger and stronger. The 31 million Vietnamese people, through their arduous struggle, have created a very favorable situation. The U.S. imperialists are irrevocably heading towards complete failure.

The victories of the Vietnamese people are the victories of people's war. The achievement of this victory is the result of the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle. As Chairman Mao said: "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, imperialism and its running dogs can definitely be defeated."

In South Vietnam, the number of invading U.S. troops has far exceeded the Korean War. Including the puppet army of South Vietnam and the U.S. mercenaries, the total has reached over 1 million. However, in the vast sea of 14 million South Vietnamese military and civilians, they can only be in a passive position of being beaten. In this so-called "dry season offensive," the U.S. imperialists have concentrated a large number of troops, using various modern weapons to launch a frenzied attack, attempting to take advantage of favorable weather to annihilate the main forces of the South Vietnamese armed struggle and reverse the defeat in their invasion of South Vietnam. However, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam have highly carried forward revolutionary heroism, flexibly and agilely using the strategies and tactics of people's war, with everyone fighting bravely and each person vying to be the first, beating the enemy into a state of chaos, unable to cope, annihilating a large number of the enemy's fighting forces, and shattering the U.S. aggressors' delusion of turning danger into safety and turning defeat into victory.

In North Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists have intensified their bombing, coordinating with the "negotiation" trick, attempting to "bomb to force negotiations." However, the 17 million military and civilians of North Vietnam have fully mobilized, coordinated operations, and used various weapons to form a deep, multi-layered sky net to defend the sacred airspace of the motherland. Whether the U.S. aggressor aircraft come by day or night, in clear weather or rain, at high altitude or low altitude, in large groups or small groups, they cannot escape the punishment of the Vietnamese people. The more the U.S. imperialists intensify their bombing, the more U.S. aggressor aircraft are shot down. Two thousand U.S. aircraft have become scrap metal on the land of North Vietnam, which is a living testament to the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. imperialists' "air superiority."

On the battlefields of Vietnam, a war of aggression and anti-aggression is being waged. The Vietnamese people are fighting against aggression. The longer the war drags on, the more the weaknesses of the U.S. imperialists, such as insufficient troops and low morale, will be exposed. While the hatred of the Vietnamese people towards the U.S. imperialists will deepen, their fighting experience will become richer, and their active role in the war will be more fully exerted. The Vietnamese people have already mastered people's war, the most effective weapon against the U.S. imperialists. As long as they persist in a protracted war, fight to the end, and tightly tie down the U.S. imperialists, gradually eating away at their fighting forces, they will definitely be able to completely defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The new victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have greatly inspired the peoples of all countries in the world who are engaged in anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles. The heroic Vietnamese people have tied down more and more U.S. imperialist troops, disrupting the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy, making a valuable contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. The Vietnamese people, with renewed efforts and fighting stronger and stronger, will definitely have an even more powerful impact on the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against U.S. imperialism.

At present, the situation in the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is getting better and better. The 31 million Vietnamese people are fighting bravely and confidently. No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists struggle and play tricks, they will absolutely not be able to save themselves from the fate of complete failure. The great cause of reunifying the country by the people of South and North Vietnam will definitely be realized.

### 人民战争的新凯歌

    人民战争的新凯歌
    从越南战场上接连传来令人振奋的捷报。越南南方军民粉碎美国侵略者的“第二个旱季攻势”，七个月中歼敌十七万多。越南北方军民击落了第二千架美国强盗飞机，打破了美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋。南方北方的辉煌战果，交相辉映，合奏出了一曲人民战争的新凯歌。七亿中国人民热烈欢呼兄弟的越南人民抗美救国斗争的新胜利，并向他们表示衷心的祝贺。
    越南人民取得的这些新的伟大胜利，最有力地证明了：在今天的越南战场上，真正的强者并不是美帝国主义，而是英雄的越南人民。美帝国主义尽管有“坚兵利器”，疯狂地实行“北炸南攻”，却逃不脱越来越惨重的失败。越南人民尽管在武器装备上不如敌人，却掌握主动，越战越强。三千一百万越南人民的艰苦奋战，已经打出了一个大好的形势。美帝国主义正在无可挽回地走向彻底的失败。
    越南人民的胜利，是人民战争的胜利。这个胜利的取得，是越南人民英勇战斗的结果。正如毛主席所说的：“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗”。
    在越南南方，美帝国主义投入的侵略军队，已经大大地超过了侵朝战争。连同南越伪军和美国的帮凶军在内，已达一百多万。但是，在一千四百万南越军民的汪洋大海中，他们只能处于被动挨打的地位。在这次所谓“旱季攻势”中，美帝国主义集结大批兵力，使用各种现代化武器，发动疯狂进攻，妄想依靠天时之利，扑灭南越人民武装主力，扭转侵略南越的败局。但是，越南南方军民高度发扬革命英雄主义，机动灵活地运用人民战争的战略战术，人人奋勇，个个争先，把敌人打得东奔西窜，顾此失彼，歼灭了敌人大量的有生力量，粉碎了美国侵略者企图转危为安，转败为胜的迷梦。
    在越南北方，美帝国主义加紧狂轰滥炸，配合“和谈”骗局，妄想“以炸迫和”。但是，越南北方一千七百万军民全力动员，协同作战，用各种武器组成了保卫祖国神圣领空的大纵深、多层次的天罗地网。美国强盗飞机不管是白天来还是晚上来，晴天来还是雨天来，高空来还是低空来，大批来还是小股来，都逃不脱越南人民的惩罚。美帝国主义越是加紧轰炸，美国强盗飞机被打下的就越多。两千架美国飞机在越南北方的土地上成了破铜烂铁，就是美帝国主义的“空中优势”彻底破产的活生生的见证。
    在越南战场上进行的是一场侵略和反侵略的战争。越南人民是为反侵略而战。战争拖得越久，美帝国主义兵力不足、士气低落等弱点就越暴露。而越南人民对于美帝国主义的仇恨越来越深，斗争经验越来越丰富，他们在战争中的能动作用就会愈加充分地发挥出来。越南人民已经掌握了人民战争这个对付美帝国主义的最有效的法宝，他们只要坚持持久战，打到底，把美帝国主义紧紧地拖住，一口一口地吃掉它的有生力量，就一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者。
    越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的新胜利，大大地鼓舞了全世界正在进行反帝革命斗争的各国人民。英雄的越南人民牵制了美帝国主义越来越多的兵力，打乱了美帝国主义的反革命全球战略，对各国人民的革命斗争作出了宝贵的贡献。越南人民再接再厉，越战越强，必将对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义的斗争产生更加有力的推动作用。
    现在，越南人民抗美救国斗争的形势越来越好。三千一百万越南人民正斗志昂扬，信心百倍地进行英勇的战斗。不管美帝国主义怎样死命挣扎，玩弄花招，都绝对无法挽救它的彻底失败的命运。越南南方和北方人民统一祖国的伟大事业是一定要实现的。
