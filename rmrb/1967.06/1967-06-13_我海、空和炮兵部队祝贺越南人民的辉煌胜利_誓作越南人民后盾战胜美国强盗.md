China's Navy, Air Force, and Artillery Units Congratulate Vietnam's Resplendent Victory and Pledge to Support the Vietnamese People in Defeating American Aggressors

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Navy, Air Force, and Artillery Units wrote letters on the 10th to the officers and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army Navy, Air Defense Air Force, and Artillery Units, enthusiastically congratulating the Vietnamese people and military on shooting down 2,000 American aggressor aircraft.

In their letter to the Vietnam People's Army Navy officers and soldiers, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Navy said, "The great victory of the Vietnamese people is a great victory of the people's war, achieved through the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese military and people under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh. The letter states that the American invaders, who have superior equipment but low morale, have been defeated by the highly politically aware Vietnamese military and people who are fighting to defend their homeland. The so-called 'air superiority' and 'sea superiority' have all been proven false."

The letter points out that the great victories of the Vietnamese people in the anti-American national salvation war have powerfully struck at the conspiracy of "peaceful coexistence" and "appeasement" hatched by American imperialism in collusion with the Soviet modern revisionists. It has greatly inspired all the peoples of the world who are fighting against imperialism and made a valuable contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

The letter states that all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Navy, together with the 700 million people of China, will follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, consistently regard supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle as our sacred internationalist duty. To support the Vietnamese military and people's anti-American national salvation war, we are not afraid of taking any risks and are willing to pay any price. We pledge to stand together with the heroic Vietnamese people and the Vietnam People's Army, fight together, and win together, and strive together for the complete defeat of the American aggressors!

In their letter to the Vietnam People's Air Defense Air Force officers and soldiers, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Air Force enthusiastically praised the brave and battle-hardened Vietnam People's Air Defense Air Force and the people of North Vietnam for their high level of courage, tenacity, and self-sacrifice under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh. They skillfully employed the strategies and tactics of people's war, forming an impenetrable net to defend the sacred airspace of their homeland, and striking down the American air aggressors, leaving them in complete defeat.

The letter from the Air Force officers and soldiers states, "Our great leader Chairman Mao said: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' American imperialism will not accept its fate of failure and will always cause trouble. We are completely confident that the Vietnamese people, who have mastered the great weapon of people's war, will surely defeat it thoroughly. The letter states that the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, further armed with Mao Zedong Thought, pledge to be a strong backbone for the Vietnamese people. We consistently regard supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle as our sacred internationalist duty. We are ready at any time to follow the orders of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and fight side by side with you to the end with American imperialism!"

In their letter to the Vietnam People's Army Artillery Units officers and soldiers, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Artillery Units said, "The glorious victory of the Vietnamese people and military in shooting down 2,000 American aggressor aircraft fully demonstrates the invincible power of people's war, shattering the myth of American imperialism's so-called 'unbeatable air superiority.'

    我海、空和炮兵部队祝贺越南人民的辉煌胜利
    誓作越南人民后盾战胜美国强盗
    据新华社十二日讯　中国人民解放军海军、空军和炮兵部队全体指战员，十日分别写信给越南民主共和国人民军海军、防空空军和炮兵部队指战员，热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落两千架美国强盗飞机的辉煌胜利。
    中国人民解放军海军全体指战员在给越南人民军海军指战员的信中说，越南人民的这一伟大胜利，是人民战争的伟大胜利，是越南军民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席正确领导下英勇奋战的结果。信中说，光有优势装备而士气低落的美国侵略者及其走狗们，被具有高度政治觉悟的、为保卫祖国而战的英雄的越南军民，打得落花流水，丢盔卸甲，所谓“空中优势”和“海上优势”，统统破产。
    信中指出，越南人民在抗美救国战争中的伟大胜利，有力地打击了美帝国主义伙同苏联现代修正主义者合搞的“压和”与“诱和”的阴谋，大大地鼓舞了全世界正在进行反帝斗争的各国人民，对各国人民的革命斗争作出了宝贵的贡献。
    信中说，中国人民解放军海军全体指战员和全中国七亿人民一起，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己神圣的国际主义义务。为了支援越南军民的抗美救国战争，我们决不怕承担任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，誓和英雄的越南人民和越南人民军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，为彻底打败美国侵略者而共同奋斗！
    中国人民解放军空军指战员在写给越南人民防空空军指战员的信中热烈赞扬英勇的、久经战斗锻炼的越南人民军防空空军和兄弟的越南北方人民，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的正确领导下，高度发扬了英勇顽强、不怕牺牲的战斗精神，灵活运用了人民战争的战略战术，组成了保卫祖国神圣领空的天罗地网，把美国空中强盗打得落花流水，一败涂地。
    空军指战员的信中说，我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义也不会甘心它失败的命运，总是要捣乱的，我们完全相信，已经掌握了人民战争这个伟大法宝的越南人民，一定会把它彻底打败。信中说，进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，并且一贯地把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己神圣的国际主义义务。我们随时准备听从最高统帅毛主席和副统帅林彪副主席的命令，和你们并肩战斗，同美帝国主义打到底！
    中国人民解放军炮兵全体指战员在写给越南人民军炮兵部队指战员的信中说，越南北方军民取得击落美国强盗飞机两千架的光辉胜利，充分显示了人民战争的无比威力，粉碎了美帝国主义所谓“空中优势不可战胜”的神话。
