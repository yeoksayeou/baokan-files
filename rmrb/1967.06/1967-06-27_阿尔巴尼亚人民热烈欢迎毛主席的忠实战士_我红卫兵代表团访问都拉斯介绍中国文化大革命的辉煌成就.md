A delegation of Chinese Red Guards, led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, visited and toured the Durres region of Albania on June 23 and 24, accompanied by Pan Alabashi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, and Liu Xiao, Chinese Ambassador to Albania. They were warmly and enthusiastically received by Marko, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the First Secretary of the Durres Regional Committee, as well as the broad masses of Durres.

On the morning of June 23, when the delegation's car arrived in Durres City, hundreds of young people had gathered in the city center square, enthusiastically shouting "Enver—Mao Zedong." A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to the delegation. The First Secretary of the Durres Regional Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, Kasmi, introduced to the guests the achievements made by the youth of the region in welcoming the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Subsequently, they accompanied the delegation to visit the "Treat Noti" Tobacco Factory. Several hundred workers of the factory had been waiting at the factory gate to warmly welcome the delegation. The factory's party, youth league, and administrative leaders introduced to the delegation the achievements made by all the workers in furthering the revolutionization of their thoughts and culture, opposing backward customs, and further liberating women. Member of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, Tan Houlan, also introduced to them the glorious achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards movement under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. When the delegation visited the workshops, the workshops immediately resonated with enthusiastic applause. The young workers and the Red Guards were as intimate as long-separated comrades, warmly embracing each other, exchanging badges and gifts. The scene of friendship was very moving, and people spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live Comrade Hoxha," "Long live the Red Guards." The slogans and applause echoed throughout the factory. In the packaging workshop, the shouts of "Enver—Mao Zedong" lasted for five minutes. The delegation presented to the workers of the factory a woven portrait of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha, as well as a silk and bamboo painting titled with Chairman Mao's poem "The sons and daughters of China have great aspirations, they love not the red but the armed." The gifts were warmly received.

In the afternoon of the same day, the Chinese Red Guards delegation visited the "Naim Frasheri" 12-year school, which first proposed the initiative to oppose religious superstition and backward customs in the nationwide further revolutionization movement. They had a discussion with the teachers and students there, exchanged experiences of revolutionary struggles between the two countries' youth, and viewed the first big-character poster put up in the school during the nationwide revolutionization movement. Members of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, such as Cheng Jinxiang, introduced to the teachers and students the process of the birth and vigorous development of the Chinese Red Guards under the personal support of Chairman Mao.

After the discussion, part of the teachers and students of the school held a welcoming rally on the playground. Kasmi, the First Secretary of the Durres Regional Committee of the Labor Youth League, and Yao Wenyuan, the leader of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, spoke at the rally.

Kasmi warmly welcomed the loyal soldiers of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Red Guards, and enthusiastically praised the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. He shouted, "Long live the Red Guards!"

Yao Wenyuan said in his speech, "Just as you support the Chinese Cultural Revolution, we support your initiative and measures to oppose religious superstition and the backward customs of the exploiting classes under the leadership of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha. We have always supported each other. Chairman Mao said, 'You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you.' We, the youth of the two countries, are all successors of communism. We must firmly hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and fight for the communist cause to the end!"

Following this, members of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, such as Tan Houlan, presented three Red Guards armbands to Kasmi, the youth league secretary of the school, Kabashi, and the student who wrote the first big-character poster, Jose. After Tan Houlan put the Red Guards armband on Jose, Jose repeatedly embraced her tightly, tears welling up in his eyes, saying, "I will forever be a revolutionary." At this moment, the entire venue was in an uproar, enthusiastically shouting slogans such as "Enver—Mao Zedong," "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples and youth of Albania and China!"

In the evening, Marko, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the First Secretary of the Durres Regional Committee, received and hosted a banquet for the Chinese Red Guards delegation. Marko and Yao Wenyuan toasted at the banquet. Marko enthusiastically praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao and praised the revolutionary pioneers of China who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, the Red Guards. The hosts and guests frequently toasted to the health of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha. At the banquet, the Chinese and Albanian comrades enthusiastically sang "The East Is Red," "The Great Ship Sails with the Helmsman," "The Eagle of the Guerrillas," "Tirana—Beijing," and other songs. The Chinese Red Guards delegation also sang the song of quotations from Chairman Mao. The banquet was filled with proletarian fighting camaraderie and revolutionary unity. Finally, everyone sang "The Internationale" together.

On June 24, the delegation visited the port of Durres, a symbol of Sino-Albanian friendship, and toured the floating crane ship (floating crane) where the communist warrior Adam Reka had worked. The captain of the floating crane ship, Truda, and Reka's former comrades introduced to the delegation the glorious deeds of Reka, who bravely sacrificed his life to defend the socialist motherland's property. The entire delegation of Chinese Red Guards, in memory and learning from this great communist warrior, respectfully took out their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and at the place where the hero fought before his martyrdom, they recited together, "To struggle means to sacrifice. Death is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the fascists, to work for the exploiters and oppressors of the people, to die for them is lighter than a feather." The delegation also visited an exhibition of the hero's life and the small bedroom where the hero had lived on the floating crane ship, seeing among the books the hero had read the works of Chairman Mao and books about the Chinese Lei Feng. The delegation wrote in the guestbook, "Learn from the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the great communist warrior Adam Reka. Lei Feng and Reka are a pair of communist brothers. They represent the eternal, unbreakable fighting friendship and the spirit of brave struggle and fearlessness of sacrifice of the revolutionary youth of the two countries, China and Albania."

The delegation also visited the mechanical factory of the Durres port. They expressed great admiration for the great achievements made by the port workers in smashing the imperialist and revisionist blockade and building socialism through self-reliance.

The delegation then visited and toured the "Sino-Albanian Friendship" agricultural collective in the Durres region. The party branch secretary of the agricultural collective, Preni, introduced to the delegation the achievements made by the collective in production and the revolutionization of thoughts. Yao Wenyuan, the leader of the delegation, handed over a letter from the "Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune" in Beijing to Preni.

At the request of the Albanian comrades, delegation member Song Yimin introduced to everyone how the Chinese People's Liberation Army studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" and "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive," and the experience of the PLA striking down American aggressors. Then, the Chinese Red Guards delegation held hands with the collective members, facing the rising sun, went to the cotton fields to participate in labor, and took a group photo with the collective members to commemorate the occasion.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢迎毛主席的忠实战士
    我红卫兵代表团访问都拉斯介绍中国文化大革命的辉煌成就
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　由姚文元同志率领的中国红卫兵代表团二十三日和二十四日在阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央书记潘·阿拉巴希和中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使刘晓陪同下参观和访问都拉斯区，受到了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、都拉斯区委第一书记马尔科和都拉斯广大群众极其热烈、亲切和友好的欢迎。
    二十三日上午，当代表团乘坐的汽车到达都拉斯市时，市中心广场上聚集了数百名欢迎的青年，他们热烈高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”，一群少先队员向代表团献了花。阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟都拉斯区委第一书记卡斯米在文化宫大厅向客人们介绍了该区青年为迎接阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟五大，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的成就。随后陪同代表团去“特拉特·诺塔”烟草工厂参观。烟草厂几百名职工早就等候在工厂门口，热烈欢迎代表团。这个厂的党、青年联盟和行政负责人向代表团介绍了全厂职工在思想、文化进一步革命化，反对落后习俗和进一步解放妇女等方面取得的成就。中国红卫兵代表团团员谭厚兰也向他们介绍了在毛主席亲自领导下的中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动的辉煌成就。代表团到车间参观时，车间内立即响起了热烈的掌声。青年工人们同红卫兵小将在一起，就象久别重逢的战友一样亲热，他们热烈拥抱，交换纪念章和礼物。友谊的场面十分动人，人们情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁”、“霍查同志万岁”、“红卫兵万岁”。口号声和掌声响彻整个工厂。在包装车间里，“恩维尔—毛泽东”的欢呼声更是连续达五分钟之久。代表团把毛主席和霍查同志的织锦像，以及一幅以毛主席诗词“中华儿女多奇志，不爱红装爱武装”为题的丝竹画赠送给这个厂的职工，受到热烈的欢迎。
    当天下午，中国红卫兵代表团访问了在全国进一步革命化运动中首先提出反对宗教迷信和落后习俗等倡议的“纳伊姆·弗拉歇里”十二年制学校，同那里的师生座谈，交换了两国青年革命斗争的经验，还观看了这个学校在全国革命化运动中贴出的第一张大字报。中国红卫兵代表团团员程金香等向该校师生介绍了中国红卫兵在毛主席亲自支持下诞生和蓬勃发展的经过。
    座谈以后，这个学校的部分师生在操场上举行了欢迎大会。劳动青年联盟都拉斯区委第一书记卡斯米和中国红卫兵代表团团长姚文元先后在会上讲话。
    卡斯米热烈欢迎毛主席的忠实战士中国红卫兵，热烈赞扬毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，高呼“红卫兵万岁！”
    姚文元在讲话中说：“象你们支持中国无产阶级文化大革命一样，我们支持你们在劳动党和霍查同志领导下所提出的反对宗教迷信和剥削阶级落后习俗的革命化倡议和措施。我们从来都是相互支持的。毛主席说：‘你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。’我们两国青年都是共产主义的接班人，一定要高举马克思列宁主义的革命大旗，为共产主义事业斗争到底！”
    接着中国红卫兵代表团团员谭厚兰等把三个红卫兵袖章分别赠送给卡斯米和这个学校的青年联盟书记卡巴希以及写出第一张大字报的约塞同学。谭厚兰给约塞戴上红卫兵袖章后，约塞再三同她紧紧拥抱，热泪盈眶地说：“我要永远作一个革命者。”这时全场沸腾，热烈欢呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“阿中两国人民和青年的战斗友谊万岁！”等口号。
    晚上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、都拉斯区委第一书记马尔科接见并设宴招待中国红卫兵代表团。马尔科和姚文元先后在宴会上祝酒。马尔科热情赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，赞扬忠实于毛泽东思想的革命闯将中国红卫兵。宾主频频为毛主席和霍查同志的身体健康干杯。宴会上，中阿两国战友热情歌唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《游击队之鹰》、《地拉那—北京》等歌曲。中国红卫兵代表团还齐声歌唱毛主席语录歌。宴会充满了无产阶级的战斗情谊和革命团结的气氛。最后，全体高唱《国际歌》。
    二十四日，代表团来到中阿友谊之港——都拉斯港，参观了共产主义战士亚当·雷卡生前工作过的浮吊船（浮动起重机）。浮吊船船长特鲁达和雷卡生前的战友向代表团介绍了雷卡为保卫社会主义祖国财产而英勇献出自己的生命的光辉事迹。中国红卫兵代表团全体成员为了纪念和学习这位伟大的共产主义战士，怀着崇敬的心情，拿出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在这位英雄牺牲前战斗过的地方，齐声朗诵：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”代表团还参观了介绍英雄生平的图片展览会和英雄生前在浮吊船内的小卧室，看到英雄生前阅读的书籍中还有毛主席著作和关于中国雷锋的书。代表团当时在留言簿上题词写道：“向伟大的共产主义战士亚当·雷卡的无产阶级革命精神学习。雷锋和雷卡是一对共产主义的亲兄弟。他们代表了中阿两国革命青年永恒的牢不可破的战斗友谊和英勇奋斗、不怕牺牲的精神。”
    代表团还参观了都拉斯港口的机械厂，他们对这个港口工人粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的封锁，自力更生建设社会主义而取得的巨大成就表示无限敬佩。
    代表团接着参观和访问了都拉斯区的“阿中友好”农业社。农业社的党支书普雷尼向代表团介绍了关于这个农业社在生产和思想革命化方面所取得的成就。姚文元团长把北京“中阿友好人民公社”托代表团转交的一封信交给了普雷尼同志。
    应阿尔巴尼亚同志的要求，代表团团员宋义民向大家介绍了中国人民解放军学习毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”和“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”等指示，以及解放军痛击美国飞贼的经过。接着，中国红卫兵代表同社员们手拉着手，迎着朝阳，来到棉花田里参加劳动，并同社员们合影留念。
