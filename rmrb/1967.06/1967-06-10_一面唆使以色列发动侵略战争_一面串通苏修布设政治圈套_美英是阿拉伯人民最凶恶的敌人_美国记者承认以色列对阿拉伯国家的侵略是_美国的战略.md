The U.S. and Britain are the most vicious enemies of the Arab people
American journalist admits Israel's aggression against Arab countries is "U.S. strategy"

	BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Ibrahim Makhous held a meeting with all foreign diplomats in Damascus except the U.S. and British ambassadors on June 6. He exposed with substantial evidence that U.S. and British aircraft participated in Israel's aggression on June 5.

	Makhous presented a transcript of the confession of a captured Israeli pilot, Ibrahim Ziran. The pilot admitted that 17 British Phantom jets arrived at an Israeli airbase from Cyprus 10 days ago, targeting Egypt. Another batch of British aircraft from the British airbase in Cyprus participated in the attack, targeting Egypt and Syria.

	Makhous pointed out that the U.S. Sixth Fleet and British aircraft carriers have formed a siege around Egypt and other Arab countries.

	BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Some reports from U.S. and British news agencies and newspapers have admitted that U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit behind Israel's aggression against Arab countries. U.S. imperialism, in collusion with British imperialism, pre-planned Israel's surprise attack on Arab countries and is now conspiring with Soviet revisionists through the United Nations to seek a ceasefire that is entirely favorable to the Israeli aggressors.

	In a report from Washington on June 7, United Press International correspondent Hansley openly stated that Israel's surprise attack was "U.S. strategy." The "U.S. strategy" is to "have Israel take rapid action" and then force Arab countries to "accept a simple ceasefire." The report also said that under U.S.-Soviet manipulation, the "United Nations Security Council called for an unconditional ceasefire in the Middle East, giving Israel the means to forcibly open the Gulf of Aqaba."

	An article from The New York Times on June 6 revealed that the U.S. Department of Defense was aware of the Israeli aggressors' "lightning war" plan in advance.

	The British Guardian on June 7 disclosed that Israel's surprise attack on Arab countries was aimed at seizing more territory from Arab countries. "This strategy gives Israel some specific territorial objectives, from which it can bargain," allowing Israel to "retain" the places it deems necessary. A report from United Press International in London on June 7 said that London's "Middle East experts" believe that "Israel's current strategy is to seize as much territory as possible before the United Nations ceasefire takes effect," giving Israel a "position of strength."

	These reports from U.S. and British news agencies and newspapers clearly show that U.S. and British imperialism, whether it is instigating Israel to launch an aggressive war or colluding with Soviet revisionists through the United Nations to push for a "ceasefire resolution," are all aimed at realizing their arrogant ambitions to invade Arab countries. However, the Arab people, who have risen to fight back, will surely smash all the plots and tricks of U.S. and British imperialism and their running dogs.

    一面唆使以色列发动侵略战争　一面串通苏修布设政治圈套
    美英是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人
    美国记者承认以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略是“美国的战略”
    据新华社大马士革电　叙利亚副总理兼外交部长易卜拉欣·马胡斯六日中午召见除美英两国大使以外的各国驻大马士革外交使节，用大量事实揭露美英飞机五日参与了以色列的侵略行动。
    马胡斯拿出了一份被俘的以色列飞行员易卜拉欣·齐兰的供词记录。这个被俘的飞行员供认，十七架英国火神式飞机在十天以前从塞浦路斯到达以色列空军基地，目标是袭击阿联，另外一批英国飞机从英国的塞浦路斯空军基地参加袭击，目标是阿联和叙利亚。
    马胡斯指出，美国第六舰队和英国航空母舰已在阿联和其他阿拉伯国家周围组成了包围圈。
    据新华社八日讯　美英通讯社和报纸的一些报道承认，美帝国主义是以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略战争的罪魁祸首。美帝国主义伙同英帝国主义，事先策划了以色列对阿拉伯国家的突然袭击，目前又勾结苏修利用联合国，竭力谋求完全有利于以色列侵略者的“停火”。
    合众国际社驻华盛顿记者汉斯莱七日的报道里毫不掩饰地说，以色列这次突然袭击就是“美国的战略”，“美国的战略”就是要“以色列迅速采取行动”，然后迫使阿拉伯国家“接受一种简单的停火”。报道还说，在美苏操纵下的“联合国安理会呼吁在中东无条件停火，使以色列获得强行开放亚喀巴湾的手段”。
    《纽约时报》记者六日从华盛顿发出的一篇评论透露，美国国防部对以色列侵略者的“闪电战”计划是事先了解的。
    英国《卫报》七日透露，这次以色列对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击，是要侵占阿拉伯国家更多的领土。“这种战略使以色列具有一些具体的领土目标，从而在这些目标方面讨价还价”，以色列就可以“保留”它认为需要的“地方”。合众国际社七日伦敦消息说，伦敦“中东问题专家”认为，“以色列当前的战略是在联合国的停火生效以前夺取尽可能多的领土”，使以色列获得“实力地位”。
    美英通讯社和报纸的这些报道清楚地表明，美英帝国主义不论是策动以色列发动侵略战争，还是勾结苏修通过联合国搞“停火决议”，都是为了实现它们侵略阿拉伯国家的狂妄野心。但是奋起而战的阿拉伯人民，必将粉碎美英帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋诡计。
