What to do when persuasion fails?

Platoon leader Liu Daozhong did ideological work with a deceived youth, encountering many setbacks. Not only did the youth not listen, but he also did not accept the persuasion. However, Liu Daozhong eventually succeeded, and the youth transformed from a member of a conservative organization into a revolutionary fighter. What was the secret to Liu Daozhong's success? It was using Mao Zedong Thought to patiently persuade the other person. The key here is "patience." If the other person does not listen, he does not speak; if the other person does not come, he does not seek, how can he succeed?

The formation of a person's erroneous thoughts is not accidental. It is not surprising if persuasion and education do not work after one or two attempts. When you encounter someone who does not listen to your persuasion, what should you do? You must be like Comrade Liu Daozhong: patient. This patience comes from a belief: believing that the majority of the masses want revolution, believing that the great Mao Zedong Thought can transform everything. With this belief, we can overcome all difficulties in ideological work and unite everyone who can be united.

Liu Daozhong's performance in this regard is worth learning from.

    说而不服怎么办？
    排长刘道忠对受蒙蔽的青年做思想工作，一连碰了好多钉子，不但是说而不服，甚至是说而不听。可是，刘道忠终于成功了，这个青年终于转变了，从保守组织的成员，变为革命派的战士。刘道忠成功的秘诀在哪里呢？就是用毛泽东思想，耐心地说服对方。“耐心”二字在这里是关键。如果对方不听，他就不说；对方不来，他就不找，怎么能成功呢？
    一个人错误思想的形成不是偶然的，进行一次两次说服教育不奏效，是并不奇怪的。当你对别人说而不服的时候怎么办？只有象刘道忠同志那样：耐心。这种耐心来自一种信心：相信群众的绝大多数是要革命的，相信伟大的毛泽东思想是能够改造一切的。有此信心，我们就能克服思想工作中的一切困难，团结一切可以团结的人。
    刘道忠在这一点上表现的革命精神，值得学习。
