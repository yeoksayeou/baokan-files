There are two ways to look at problems. One is dialectical materialism, and the other is metaphysics. According to Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy of dialectical materialism, we must look at everything comprehensively, distinguishing between the essence and main aspects of things and their phenomena and secondary aspects. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard has learned and applied this viewpoint and method, correctly handling the differences and contradictions among various revolutionary mass organizations, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and achieving great unity on the basis of a common direction.

In contrast to dialectical materialism, one characteristic of metaphysics is to view problems one-sidedly, seeing only phenomena and not essence, seeing only secondary aspects and not main aspects. If this metaphysical method is used to view problems within revolutionary mass organizations, it will lead to focusing only on the shortcomings and errors of the other side, exaggerating them, and raising them to an extreme, forgetting the enemy, and engaging in "internal warfare." The result will be to lose the direction of the struggle and deviate from the correct track of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We should advocate dialectical materialism and oppose metaphysics.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, June 14 - With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard (formerly Zhonghua Shipyard) has insisted on learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, seriously studying the policies related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, correctly handling contradictions among the people, and, on the basis of a common direction, adopting the principle of "seeking common ground while reserving differences" to achieve great unity among various revolutionary mass organizations. On June 12, the factory established a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire factory - the Dongfanghong Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters.

The factory originally had five revolutionary mass organizations. Apart from the "Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters" affiliated "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps" with over 2,000 members, the other four revolutionary mass organizations had fewer members, with the smallest having only a dozen people. Although these five revolutionary mass organizations had a common direction, they had different views on many specific issues. Due to the lack of a correct attitude to resolve these issues in the past, it affected the rapid realization of great unity.

With the help of the army, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the factory, while studying many problems encountered in great unity, studied Chairman Mao's works, the relevant editorials of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*, and other documents, as well as the experiences of advanced units such as the Guiyang Cotton Mill. Recently, they also studied the resolution of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee dated June 2. Through their studies, they repeatedly compared their thoughts and actions, gradually finding the fundamental reason why great unity had not been rapidly achieved: they had not correctly distinguished between the two types of contradictions using Mao Zedong Thought, nor had they used Chairman Mao's viewpoint and methods to analyze and handle the problems existing among revolutionary mass organizations, resulting in mutual lack of unity and even opposition. Many comrades from the "December 24th Daring Rebel Squad" and "Successor Red Daring Squad," mainly composed of young workers, said: "Just as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, we did not look at the essential and mainstream aspects of problems but emphasized non-essential and non-mainstream aspects. Therefore, for a period, we focused on finding the shortcomings of the 'Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps,' forgetting their significant role in seizing leadership, resisting the counter-revolutionary economic trend, and stabilizing revolutionary and production order during the January Revolution. They did not unite with other revolutionary organizations in the factory to seize power at that time, which was inappropriate. However, this problem can be solved through the realization of great unity and the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.' If we adopt an attitude of not cooperating with them, or even attacking them, we would not grasp the direction of the struggle."

Similarly, comrades from the "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps" reflected on their work in the previous stage through learning and rectification, acknowledging their mistake of "acting like the big brother" and "putting oneself first." In the issue of great unity, they wanted to "absorb the small with the big." They recalled the revolutionary friendship of fighting together, winning together, and the battles they had shared with these revolutionary mass organizations since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. What they could not forget was that at the critical moment of the power seizure struggle, some people with ulterior motives and the deceived masses participating in conservative organizations held a parade and demonstration in the factory, opposing the power seizure by the "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps." At this time, revolutionary mass organizations such as the "Shipyard Revolutionary League Dongfanghong Rebel Corps," although dissatisfied with the "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps" seizing power without consulting other organizations, still firmly stood by their side and actively supported them. Thinking of these situations, they felt even more that they should not adopt a distrustful attitude towards these revolutionary comrades who had fought side by side with them. They believed that some members of their corps had previously violently smashed the "December 24th Daring Rebel Squad" over some trivial issues, which was a serious mistake.

With the help of the army, members of various revolutionary mass organizations, through learning, raised their ideological awareness and learned the correct method of analyzing problems, looking at each other's mainstream, and following Chairman Mao's directive on correctly handling contradictions among the people, humbly examining their own shortcomings and errors in the previous stage. The "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps" even specially posted a big-character poster to apologize and make amends to the "December 24th Daring Rebel Squad" they had previously smashed. Thus, these revolutionary mass organizations that had once fought together were further strengthened in their unity on a new basis. The broad proletarian revolutionary fighters unanimously expressed that in the future, they would firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and always direct their spears at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

On the basis of strengthening unity, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the factory achieved great unity in a common direction. In the process of unity, various revolutionary mass organizations had many different opinions on many specific issues, but they believed that this was a normal phenomenon. If they hoped to unify all differing opinions by 100% before uniting, they would never achieve great unity. They adopted the principle of "seeking common ground while reserving differences" to handle the differences in opinions among them, that is, everything should be based on what is beneficial to the current revolutionary struggle, eliminating selfishness and杂念, insisting on a correct stance on directional issues, and making concessions on trivial issues. For example, in the process of achieving great unity, whether to absorb some revolutionary masses who already met the conditions into the proletarian revolutionary faction organization, and when to absorb them, various revolutionary mass organizations had debates on this type of issue. For these issues, they thoroughly discussed and solved what could be solved; what could not be solved immediately was gradually solved. They said: "If we get bogged down in these specific issues, obstructing the realization of great unity, that would be putting the cart before the horse, violating the big direction." For the organizational form and election methods of the unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire factory, they also had thorough discussions, but they did not seek perfection, preparing to continuously improve in future practice. As a result, although some revolutionary mass organizations still had differences on certain specific issues, the great unity was finally achieved.

    上海东方红造船厂无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作
    抓主流　看本质　正确处理内部矛盾
    求大同存小异，实现革命大联合，矛头一致对准一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    编者按：看问题有两种方法。一种是唯物辩证法，一种是形而上学。
    按照毛主席一贯提倡的唯物辩证法，我们对任何事情都要全面地去看，分清哪些是事物的本质和主流，哪些是事物的现象和支流。上海东方红造船厂的无产阶级革命派，学习和运用了这个观点和方法，正确地处理了各革命群众组织之间的分歧和矛盾，求大同，存小异，在大方向一致的基础上，实现了革命的大联合。
    同唯物辩证法相反，形而上学的特征之一，就是片面地看问题，只看现象，不看本质，只看支流，不看主流。在革命群众组织内部，如果用形而上学的方法去看问题，那就会只抓对方的缺点错误，极力夸大，无限上纲，忘记敌人，热中于打“内战”。其结果，就会迷失斗争大方向，偏离无产阶级文化大革命的正确轨道。
    我们应当提倡唯物辩证法，反对形而上学。
    新华社上海十四日电　上海东方红造船厂（原中华造船厂）的无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军的帮助下，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，认真学习有关无产阶级文化大革命的政策，正确处理人民内部矛盾，各革命群众组织在大方向一致的前提下，采取“求大同，存小异”的原则，实现了革命的大联合。六月十二日，这个厂成立了全厂统一的革命群众组织——东方红工人革命造反总部。
    这个厂原有五个革命群众组织，除了“上海工人革命造反总司令部”所属的“工人革命造反兵团”有两千多名成员外，其他四个革命群众组织的人数都比较少，最小的组织只有十几个人。这五个革命群众组织虽然大方向一致，但在许多具体问题上有不同的看法，由于过去没有采取正确的态度加以解决，以致影响了革命大联合的迅速实现。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派，在解放军的帮助下，带着大联合中遇到的许多问题，学习了毛主席的著作，学习了《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》的有关社论以及其他文件，学习了贵阳棉纺厂等先进单位的经验。最近，又学习了上海市革命委员会六月二日的决议。在学习中，他们反复对照自己的思想和行动，逐渐找到了没有能迅速实现革命大联合的根本原因，就是没有以毛泽东思想来正确区别两类不同性质的矛盾，用毛主席提倡的观点和方法来分析和处理革命群众组织之间存在的问题，结果造成了相互间的不团结，甚至对立。以青年工人为主体组成的“一二·二四猛闯造反队”和“继红敢闯战斗队”的许多同志说：“正象我们伟大的领袖毛主席所指出的那样，我们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面，非主流方面的东西。因而有一个时期就专门去找‘工人革命造反兵团’的缺点，忘记了他们在一月革命中夺取领导权、顶住反革命经济主义歪风逆流、稳定革命和生产秩序所起的重大作用。他们当时没有和厂内其他革命组织联合起来夺权，是不妥当的。但是，这个问题可以通过实现革命大联合和革命‘三结合’来解决。如果因此而采取和他们不合作的态度，甚至对他们进行攻击，那就没有掌握斗争大方向。”同样，“工人革命造反兵团”的同志，结合学习和整风，总结了前一阶段的工作，认为自己有“老大自居，以我为主”的错误思想，在大联合的问题上想“以大并小”。他们回顾了无产阶级文化大革命开展以来和这几个革命群众组织团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起的战斗友谊，特别使他们不能忘记的是在夺权斗争的关键时刻，一些别有用心的人以及受蒙蔽的参加保守组织的群众，在厂内“游行示威”，反对“工人革命造反兵团”夺权，这时“船革会东方红造反兵团”等革命群众组织，虽然对“工人革命造反兵团”不和其他组织商量就单独夺权的做法不满，但还是坚决站在他们一边，积极地支持他们。想到这些情况，他们就越加感到不应该以不信任的态度对待这些曾经和自己并肩作战的革命战友。他们认为，自己兵团的少数成员，以前因为某些枝节问题粗暴地砸了“一二·二四猛闯造反队”，这是严重的错误。
    在解放军的帮助下，各个革命群众组织的成员，通过学习，提高了思想觉悟，学会了分析问题的正确方法，互相看对方的主流，按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，虚心检查了自己前一阶段的缺点和错误。“工人革命造反兵团”还特地贴出大字报向被他们砸过的“一二·二四猛闯造反队”道歉赔礼。于是，这些曾经共同战斗过的革命群众组织，又在新的基础上进一步加强了团结。广大无产阶级革命派战士一致表示，今后要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，始终把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派在加强了团结的基础上，在大方向一致的前提下，实现了革命的大联合。在联合的过程中，各个革命群众组织对许多具体问题有许多不同的意见，但他们认为，这是正常的现象。如果希望把所有分歧意见百分之百地统一起来再联合，那就永远也实现不了大联合。他们采取了“求大同，存小异”的原则来处理彼此之间的意见分歧，就是说，一切要从有利于当前的革命斗争出发，破除私心杂念，对于方向性的问题坚持正确立场，对于枝节性的问题互相让步。例如，在实现革命大联合过程中，要不要把一些已经具备条件的革命群众吸收到无产阶级革命派组织里来的问题，在什么时候吸收的问题等等，各革命群众组织之间都有过争论。对于这一类问题，他们经过充分讨论，能够解决的就尽量解决；一时不能解决的，则逐步解决。他们说：“如果在这些具体问题上纠缠不清，以致阻碍了革命大联合的实现，那就是本末倒置，违背了大方向。”对于全厂统一的革命群众组织的组织形式和选举方法等，他们也都进行了充分的讨论，但不求尽善尽美，而是准备在今后的实践中不断完善。这样做的结果，一些革命群众组织尽管在某些具体问题上还存在分歧，但是革命的大联合终于胜利实现。
