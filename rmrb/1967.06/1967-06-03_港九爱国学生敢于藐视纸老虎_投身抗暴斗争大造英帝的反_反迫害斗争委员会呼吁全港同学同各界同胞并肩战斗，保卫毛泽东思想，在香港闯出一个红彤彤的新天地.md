Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic students dare to defy the paper tiger
Throw themselves into the struggle against violence and create a counter-offensive against British imperialism
The Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee calls on all students and compatriots in Hong Kong to join forces and fight shoulder to shoulder to defend Mao Zedong Thought and create a bright red new world in Hong Kong

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, June 2 - Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic students held a representative meeting on June 1, declaring the establishment of the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee" and adopted the "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong." The meeting solemnly declared that the patriotic students of Hong Kong and Kowloon resolutely defy British imperialism's paper tiger, settle old and new accounts with it, and march forward on the blood-stained path of their comrades, determined to defend Mao Zedong Thought and create a bright red new world!

At the meeting, all representatives present solemnly swore before the portrait of Chairman Mao: We resolutely throw ourselves into this anti-persecution struggle, determined to defend Mao Zedong Thought. We can die, we can shed blood, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!

The meeting was conducted in a fervent atmosphere. The students united in their hatred of the enemy and angrily denounced the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. They said, tens of thousands of patriotic compatriots on the streets, in prisons, and in courts are bravely fighting against the Hong Kong British authorities. They are indeed outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland and are excellent examples for us to learn from. We must march forward on the blood-stained path of our comrades!

The students said, we are the youth of the Mao Zedong era. We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding light, and we have the Red Guards as our example. We fear neither heaven nor earth, neither gods nor ghosts. Why should we fear British imperialism and the Hong Kong British authorities, these few flies that have hit the wall? The Hong Kong British authorities are most afraid of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. They think they can suppress the spread of Mao Zedong Thought with violence. Can black hands cover the sun? We will do the opposite, study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death. We must hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher and higher, sweep away all harmful creatures, and carry the anti-persecution struggle to the end!

The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" adopted at the meeting said, the Hong Kong British authorities have systematically, deliberately, and organized the persecution of our compatriots with inhuman methods, using fascist ruthless means to carry out bloody suppression. Our youth students and compatriots from all walks of life have shed their blood all over the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Thousands of compatriots and students have been beaten, brutally arrested, tortured, and illegally sentenced. "The imperialists are bullying us like this, and this needs to be seriously dealt with." Can we young students sit idly by and watch our fellow students and compatriots being persecuted and tortured? No, a thousand times no! A million times no! We must protest! We must denounce! We must rise up and resist! We must settle accounts with British imperialism, both new and old accounts! Blood debts must be repaid with blood!

The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" exposed the long-term implementation of slave education by the Hong Kong British authorities on Hong Kong students, aiming to make Hong Kong Chinese youth betray their motherland and their nation. It pointed out: We are upright Chinese people. We must smash the poison and plots of British imperialism. Slave education, the trap of fame and wealth, go to hell! We must love our great motherland! We must love our great leader Chairman Mao! We must love the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought! The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our red hearts will never change!

The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" said, for more than a hundred years, British imperialism has committed heinous crimes against the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, owing us countless blood debts. Now they are crazily suppressing our youth students and compatriots with bloody force. Old grudges and new hatreds are countless! We must stand up, raise our arms high, and create a counter-offensive against British imperialism! Let us inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolutionary youth of the May Fourth Movement, "Dare to be killed, dare to pull the emperor off his throne." Smash the fascist shackles of the Hong Kong British authorities, cut off the bloody hands of the Hong Kong British authorities. "Only heroes drive tigers and leopards, no heroes fear bears and wolves." The patriotic students of Hong Kong and Kowloon schools have already taken to the front lines of the battle. The patriotic students of various universities, secondary schools, and even primary schools in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories have stood up and joined the anti-persecution struggle in various ways. Let us all students in Hong Kong and Kowloon hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, bravely fight, and create a bright red new world!

The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" sternly warned the Hong Kong British authorities: The Chinese people are not to be trifled with! The awakened Hong Kong youth students resolutely want to rebel against you! If you dare to continue to be enemies of the seven hundred million Chinese people, dare to continue to be enemies of the compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, dare to continue to suppress the anti-violence movement of Hong Kong youth students, you will surely receive a severe blow, surely hit your head and bleed! You have done enough evil, you will surely reap what you sow. You will surely not have a good end.

The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" said, we order the Hong Kong British authorities:

1. Immediately stop all bloody suppression and fascist atrocities;
2. Immediately and unconditionally release workers, youth students, and compatriots from all walks of life who have been unjustly arrested;
3. Immediately stop all persecution measures against patriotic school students and all students in Hong Kong;
4. Immediately accept the five demands proposed by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs;
5. Immediately accept the four demands proposed by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of all walks of life.

The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" concluded, fellow students, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao has great hopes for us young students. He said: "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the end, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of your lives, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you." Let us unite under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, organize, and take action. "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, strive for victory." We have Chairman Mao's support, we have the support of seven hundred million compatriots, we have the strong backing of the People's Liberation Army, and we have the support of the heroic Red Guards. We will surely win! The British will surely lose!
