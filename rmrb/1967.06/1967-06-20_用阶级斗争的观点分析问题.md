A clique of capitalists within the Huaibei Metal Structure Factory who are in power, incited the conservative organization's masses, who were unaware of the truth, to stage a work stoppage. The revolutionary faction believes: the work stoppage disrupted production and caused losses to the state, "deserving a thousand deaths." The deceived masses, however, believe: the work stoppage was to resolve the factory's cultural revolution issues, and going to the central authorities to complain is a "revolutionary action."

How should we understand and handle this issue? At the time, our thinking was not very clear. We did not analyze the problem from the perspective of class struggle, but only discussed the matter at hand, merely calculating the economic losses caused by the stoppage of production. As a result, we could not persuade the masses. They said: "We can use our rest time, work overtime, and make up for the losses caused by the stoppage, right?"

With this problem in mind, we studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao said: "Without a correct political standpoint, it is like having no soul." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a serious political struggle. Many issues must be viewed from the perspective of class struggle to see things from a higher and broader perspective, and to help the deceived masses fundamentally raise their class consciousness. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, together with the deceived masses, used Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle in socialist society to analyze the nature of this incident. The work stoppage and complaint, which seemed to be for resolving the factory's cultural revolution issues, were actually instigated by the factory's capitalists in power. They aligned with the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line in society, inciting and creating the work stoppage and complaint incident, putting pressure on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and attempting to suppress the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to protect themselves. If their plot succeeded, the factory's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would be halted midway, and the power in the hands of the proletariat would be seized by the bourgeoisie.

Through patient persuasion and education, many deceived masses realized: the work stoppage and complaint are not just about causing economic losses to the state. This is a means by which a clique of capitalists within the party in power attacks Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. This is a reflection of the entire social class struggle. And they were deceived, unknowingly becoming tools of theirs. Some workers excitedly said: "We always shout about defending Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, but we ended up becoming the attackers of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We are truly guilty!" They expressed their determination to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and launch a fierce attack on the factory's capitalists in power.

    用阶级斗争的观点分析问题
    夏善亮
    华北金属结构厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，煽动保守组织中不明真相的群众，搞了个停工事件。对这个问题，革命派认为：停工破坏了生产，给国家造成损失，“罪该万死”。受蒙蔽的群众则认为：停工是为了解决厂内文化革命的问题，到中央告状是“革命行动”。
    应该怎样认识和处理这个问题呢？当时我们思想上也不大明确，没有用阶级斗争观点来分析问题，只是就事论事，光从停止生产给国家造成多大损失上算经济账。结果，说服不了群众，他们说：“我们利用休息时间，加班加点，弥补上停工的损失，不就行了吗？”
    带着这个问题，我们学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。毛主席说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”无产阶级文化大革命，是一场严肃的政治斗争，许多问题，要从阶级斗争的观点来看，才能站得高，看得远，才能帮助受蒙蔽的群众从根本上提高阶级觉悟。我们按照毛主席的教导，和受蒙蔽的群众一起，用毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的观点分析这次事件的性质。停工“告状”，看来是为了解决厂里文化大革命的问题，实际上是受了厂里走资本主义道路当权派的利用。他们和社会上的资产阶级反动路线新反扑相呼应，煽动和制造了停工“告状”的事件，向毛主席的革命路线施加压力，妄图把无产阶级文化大革命压下去，达到保护他们自己过关的罪恶目的。如果他们的阴谋得逞，厂里的无产阶级文化大革命就会半途而废，掌握在无产阶级手里的权力又会被资产阶级夺去。
    经过耐心的说服教育，许多受蒙蔽的群众认识到：停工“告状”，不只是给国家造成经济损失的问题。这是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派向毛主席、向党中央进攻的一种手段。这是整个社会阶级斗争的反映。而自己是受了蒙蔽，不自觉地充当了他们的工具。有的工人激动地说：“我们成天喊着要保卫毛主席、保卫党中央，想不到却充当了向毛主席革命路线进攻的打手，真是有罪啊！”他们表示要坚决站到毛主席的革命路线上来，向厂里走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。
    通过实践，我们深深体会到：革命群众热爱毛主席，热爱共产党。要把这种朴实的阶级感情提高到自觉的程度，就要狠抓阶级斗争的教育，狠抓两条路线斗争的教育。只要帮助他们分清大是大非，用阶级斗争的观点认识问题，他们就会很快地站到毛主席的革命路线上来。
