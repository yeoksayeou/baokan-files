According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on June 1, the May 31 issue of the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army" published an article by Nguen Chi Thanh, celebrating the great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people in the 1966-1967 dry season. The article pointed out that the glorious victories of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people have greatly encouraged the entire Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are determined to advance with an overwhelming momentum to thoroughly defeat American imperialism.

The article said that American imperialism, on the less than 170,000 square kilometers of South Vietnamese territory, has deployed more than a million American, puppet, and mercenary troops (including over 400,000 American aggressor troops), using all kinds of the latest weapons except nuclear weapons. Compared to the 1965-1966 dry season, the number of American aggressor troops has doubled. The enemy, with such a massive military force, attempted to create a "turning point" on the battlefield and achieve a decisive victory in a short period. However, in this fierce confrontation, the American bandits once again suffered a strategic defeat, and the heroic South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people achieved the greatest victory since the start of the struggle against American aggression to save the nation.

After listing the brilliant achievements of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people over the past seven months, the article pointed out that in the face of the enemy's frenzied increase in strength by a factor of two, the South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people have annihilated nearly half more of the enemy's combat forces than in the previous winter-spring season, defending and expanding the liberated areas. This is a tremendous victory. The South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people not only annihilated a large number of enemy troops but also destroyed a significant portion of the enemy's elite forces and a large number of American modern war tools. The South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people not only seized the initiative and maintained the offensive advantage but also fully exploited this advantage. They not only defeated the enemy but also grew stronger with each battle.

The article also pointed out that the South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people have once again foiled the American bandits' and their lackeys' "pacification" plans. Despite deploying all the puppet troops, one-tenth of the American troops, and part of the South Korean mercenary troops, concentrating forces to carry out key "pacification," even in these key areas such as Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Long An, and Binh Thuan provinces, guerrilla warfare has developed the fastest, and the American "pacification of the countryside" plan has failed. This is the most severe failure of the American new colonialist policy in South Vietnam since the fall of their puppet Ngo Dinh Diem.

The article said that after this winter-spring season's victory, a new situation has emerged on the South Vietnamese battlefield. From the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region, the Central Highlands, the central coastal area to the southeastern region and the Mekong Delta, all battlefields are vibrant. Throughout the South, there are main force units and local force units' strongholds everywhere, and guerrilla warfare is like a net covering the land. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army, in fierce confrontations with the enemy, has rapidly grown, its strength continuously expanding and becoming stronger, and its experience increasingly rich. This vivid fact proves the heavy defeat of the American so-called "pincer attack" strategy and the "escalation" policy of attacking the North and isolating the South revolution.

The article said that the South Vietnamese people's armed forces and people have achieved brilliant victories in the winter-spring season, turning the possibility of defeating more than a million American puppet troops and mercenaries into a glorious reality. This winter-spring season's victory has created new premises and shown new hopes for further achieving even greater victories.

The article pointed out that the great victories of the 1966-1967 dry season are the glorious victories of the will of the 14 million South Vietnamese people and the entire Vietnamese nation, fighting to the death against the American aggressors for independence, for the unification of the motherland, for socialism, and for fulfilling the sacred international duty to the revolutionary cause of the world's people.

The article said that in more than ten years of struggle against American aggression to save the nation, the South Vietnamese people have achieved extremely brilliant victories. In the past two years of fighting against the American aggressor troops and puppet troops, the South Vietnamese people have achieved even greater and more brilliant victories. Currently, the revolutionary situation in the South is better than ever.

The article said that the American bandits have suffered a heavy defeat, but they will still play new and more vicious tricks, continuing to intensify their aggression in the South and fiercely attack the North, attempting to rescue their predicament. However, the Vietnamese people are already prepared. No matter how great the sacrifices, how much hardship to endure, whether fighting for five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, they will definitely fight to the end until they defeat the American aggressors. Vietnam will win, and the American bandits will be defeated.

### 阮志清欢呼越南南方军民在旱季战斗中取得巨大胜利  南越革命形势好  军民坚决打到底  美帝出动兵力比去年旱季增加一倍而南越军民歼敌人数增加一半

    阮志清欢呼越南南方军民在旱季战斗中取得巨大胜利
    南越革命形势好  军民坚决打到底
    美帝出动兵力比去年旱季增加一倍而南越军民歼敌人数增加一半
    据新华社河内一日电　越南《人民军队报》五月三十一日刊登了阮志清写的一篇文章，欢呼越南南方军民在一九六六年——一九六七年旱季中取得的巨大胜利。文章指出，越南南方军民的显赫战功，使越南全国军民受到极大鼓舞，越南人民决心以压倒敌人的气势乘胜前进，彻底打败美帝国主义。
    文章说，美帝国主义在不超过十七万平方公里的越南南方土地上，出动了一百多万名美、伪军和帮凶军（其中美国侵略军四十多万人），使用了除核武器以外的所有各种最新式武器。同一九六五——一九六六年旱季相比，美国侵略军增加了一倍。敌人使用这样一支庞大的军事力量，妄图在战场上造成一个“转折点”，在一个短时间内争取决定性的胜利。然而，在这场激烈的较量中，美国强盗又一次在战略上遭到惨败，英雄的越南南方军民取得了抗美救国斗争开始以来最巨大的胜利。
    文章举述了南越军民七个月来的辉煌战果之后指出，越南南方军民在敌人疯狂地把力量增加一倍的情况下，消灭了比前一个冬春季多将近一半的敌军有生力量，保卫和扩大了解放区。这是一个非常巨大的胜利。南方军民不但消灭了大量敌人，而且消灭了敌人的一部分最精锐的力量，击毁了美国的大量现代化战争工具。越南南方军民不但掌握主动权、保持进攻优势，而且还大力发挥进攻优势，不但战胜了敌人，而且越打越强。
    文章还指出，越南南方军民又一次粉碎了美国强盗及其走狗的“绥靖”计划。尽管它们投入了伪军的全部力量和美军的十分之一以及一部分南朝鲜帮凶军，集中力量进行重点“绥靖”，但是，就是在这些重点地区，如广南、广义、平定、隆安、槟椥等省，游击战争反而发展得最快，美国的“绥靖农村”的计划遭到破产。这是美国从它的走狗吴庭艳倒台以来在越南南方推行的新殖民主义政策的最惨重的一次失败。
    文章说，在这一个冬春季胜利之后，南方战场上出现了一个新的局面。从广治—承天地区、西原地区、中部中区沿海到南部东区和湄公河三角洲的各个战场上，都呈现出一派蓬蓬勃勃的景象。在整个南方，到处都有主力部队、地方部队的拳头，处处都有游击战争的天罗地网。南方解放军在同敌人的激烈较量中，迅速地成长起来，力量日益发展壮大，经验越来越丰富。这一生动的事实，证明了美国的所谓“钳形攻势”战略和袭击北方、孤立南方革命的“升级”政策的惨重失败。
    文章说，越南南方军民在冬春季取得了辉煌的胜利，已经和正在把战胜一百多万美伪军和帮凶军的可能性，变成光辉的现实。这个冬春季的胜利，为进一步夺取更加巨大的胜利创造了新的前提，展现了新的希望。
    文章指出，一九六六——一九六七年旱季的巨大胜利，是一千四百万越南南方人民和全体越南民族为了独立，为了统一祖国，为了社会主义，为了履行对世界人民的革命事业所承担的崇高的国际义务而决战决胜美国侵略强盗的意志的辉煌胜利。
    文章说，越南南方人民在十多年抗美救国斗争中，接连取得了极其辉煌的胜利。南方人民在同美国侵略军和伪军战斗的近两年里，又取得了更加巨大、更加辉煌的胜利，目前，南方革命的形势比过去任何时期都好。
    文章说，美国强盗已经遭到惨败，但它还会玩弄新的、更加恶毒的阴谋，还会继续加强对南方的侵略战争和猛烈地袭击北方，企图挽救它的困境。但是，越南人民已经作好了准备。不管要作出多大的牺牲，忍受多大的艰苦，不管战斗五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，也坚决战斗到底，直到战胜美国侵略强盗。越南必胜，美国强盗必败。
