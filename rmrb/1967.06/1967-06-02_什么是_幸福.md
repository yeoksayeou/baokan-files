Those Soviet youths corrupted by revisionist thought, what do they consider to be "happiness"? According to a survey reported by TASS, "the vast majority believe that 'interesting work, love, and respect from those around them' are the main components of personal happiness." Some youths express a desire to "have a lot of money," while others "want to enjoy life forever."

Someone asked a student at Moscow University, "What are your life plans for ten years from now?" The student replied, "I hope to get a second or third-class apartment, just one child, and a monthly income of three hundred rubles. I probably still won't be able to buy a car."

    什么是“幸福”
    那些被修正主义思想腐蚀的苏联青年，认为什么是“幸福”呢？据塔斯社报道的一次调查表明，
  “绝大多数人都认为‘有趣的工作、恋爱和尊重周围的人’是组成个人幸福的主要东西”。有的青年则表示愿意“有许多钱”，有的“想毕生玩乐”。
    有人问莫斯科大学一个学生：“你十年后的生活设想是什么”？这个学生回答说：“我希望得到二等或三等公寓，只要一个小孩，每月收入三百卢布。恐怕还无法买一辆小轿车。”
