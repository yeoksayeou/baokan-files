The ceasefire resolution on the Middle East issue, manipulated by the United States and the Soviet Union to extinguish the Arab people's anti-aggression fire, has been opposed by Arab countries.

According to an announcement by the Egyptian ambassador to Paris on June 7, Egypt rejected the Security Council's so-called call for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East.

On the same day, Iraq's Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Hayala, also announced in a statement that the Iraqi government rejected the Security Council's ceasefire resolution.

	According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio on June 6, the Supreme Command of the United Arab Republic issued a statement on June 6 announcing that Egypt decided to stop navigation in the Suez Canal. The statement said: "Based on conclusive evidence, the governments of the United States and Britain have intervened in the military aggression launched by the Israeli enemy. Now, Egypt decides to stop navigation in the Suez Canal. The Israeli enemy's military aggression is evident in its extremely despicable tactics against the Jordanian front, where Iraqi and Jordanian forces are fighting together, in its air activities on the Egyptian front, and in the air protection provided by American and British aircraft carriers to the airspace of the Israeli enemy."

The statement said: "In addition, the Israeli enemy has been continuously provoking and attacking ships passing through the canal. Therefore, Egypt is forced to stop ships from navigating the canal to ensure the safety of this extremely important waterway and to avoid possible long-term obstructions to the canal."

    阿联伊拉克表示拒绝联合国“停火决议”  
    阿联最高司令部决定停止苏伊士运河的航运
    新华社七日讯　美苏合谋为扑灭阿拉伯人民反侵略的战火而操纵联合国安全理事会通过的关于中东问题的“停火决议”，遭到了阿拉伯国家的反对。
    据阿联驻巴黎大使七日宣布，阿联拒绝了安理会关于在中东立即“停火”的所谓呼吁。
    同一天，伊拉克负责总统事务的国务部长哈伊拉拉在一项公报中也宣布，伊拉克政府拒绝安理会的“停火决议”。
    新华社开罗六日电　据开罗电台六日广播，阿拉伯联合共和国最高司令部六日发表公报宣布，阿联决定停止苏伊士运河的航运。公报说：“根据确凿的证据，美国和英国政府干预了以色列敌人所发动的军事侵略，现在阿联决定停止苏伊士运河的航运。以色列的军事侵略表现在对伊拉克和约旦军队联合作战的约旦前线采取极其卑鄙的方式，表现在敌人在埃及前线的空中活动，表现在美国和英国的航空母舰向以色列敌人的领空提供空中保护伞。”
    公报说：“此外，以色列敌人对通过运河的船只不断进行侵略挑衅，因此阿联被迫停止船只在运河上航行，以保证这条极重要的水道的安全，避免造成可能使运河长期受到阻碍的后果。”
