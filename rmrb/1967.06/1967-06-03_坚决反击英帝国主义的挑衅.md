A great battle against the bloody oppression of British imperialism has erupted in Hong Kong. Since early May, Hong Kong patriots, undeterred by the British military police's brutal suppression, have taken to the streets, holding aloft the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Workers from various industries have declared strikes and work stoppages. They have fought bravely, fearlessly sacrificing themselves, and engaged in fierce struggles with the British military police and thugs. This massive, thrilling anti-imperialist mass movement is developing with great momentum.

The British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding repeated warnings from the Chinese government, not only have not admitted their guilt for the fascist atrocities they committed but have instead escalated their provocations against the Chinese people. They continue to illegally arrest and interrogate our patriots, subjecting the detainees to horrifying beatings and torture. They have issued a series of so-called "emergency decrees," creating a "legal" basis for "justifying persecution and criminalizing resistance," in an attempt to suppress our patriots' anti-imperialist, anti-fascist struggle through large-scale arrests and persecution. They have even brought in an aircraft carrier, openly boasting that they will "show their strength." British imperialism has truly gone mad!

British imperialism thinks that with a few batons, a few decrees, and a few warships, they can intimidate the Chinese people. This is sheer delusion. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The patriots in Hong Kong have said it well: if the Hong Kong authorities escalate their atrocities, the anti-British struggle will also escalate. They warn the British imperialists: this struggle has just begun; more magnificent and inspiring battles lie ahead! Once the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon have launched their counterattacks, they must persist in their struggle, resist the enemy, pursue the fleeing foe, and fight British imperialism to the ground!

British imperialism is the evil colonial ruler of Hong Kong, the enemy of the 400 million compatriots in Hong Kong, and the enemy of the 700 million people of China. For over a hundred years, this decayed, savage imperialism has subjected our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to cruel oppression. The military, police, secret agents, courts, and prisons in Hong Kong are all tools of oppression against our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. British imperialism has ruthlessly plundered and exploited our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, plunging them into poverty. It has also used the most decadent and corrupt Western culture to poison and corrupt our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. In recent years, the British government has colluded with American imperialism, attempting to turn Hong Kong into a base for the U.S. war in Vietnam and an anti-China base. Hong Kong under British colonial rule is a den of iniquity, a dark hell. For over a hundred years, British imperialism has committed countless crimes in Hong Kong, with blood debts and heinous sins that must be settled!

The patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon are further engaging in a struggle of principle against British imperialism. British imperialism serves as a negative example, using fascist atrocities to force our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to launch a movement of hatred, contempt, and scorn against British imperialism. They must take all possible actions, politically, economically, and culturally, to launch a powerful counterattack against British imperialism's colonial rule. They must loudly and boldly expose and publicize the heinous crimes British imperialism has committed in Hong Kong over the past hundred years, mobilize the masses to make blood-curdling accusations, and make every household in Hong Kong aware, so that they can thoroughly understand the reactionary and decadent nature of the aggressive British imperialism.

This struggle should primarily rely on the working class of Hong Kong, who are the main force of the revolution. It is also necessary to fully mobilize the broad masses of young students, combining the student movement with the workers' movement. With the working class of Hong Kong as the core, mobilize the patriots of various strata in Hong Kong, and direct the struggle's spearhead at Anglo-American imperialism, first and foremost at the British imperialism that directly rules Hong Kong.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, absolutely no force can break. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries."

No matter how arrogant and rampant British imperialism is in Hong Kong at present, as long as the patriots of Hong Kong further unite and organize, forming a vast revolutionary force and launching a magnificent anti-imperialist mass movement, they can form a real revolutionary iron wall, which British imperialism can absolutely not break. On the contrary, the evil British imperialism will be smashed to pieces against this iron wall!

British imperialism continues to wreak havoc in Hong Kong, committing bloody oppression against our patriots, which is absolutely intolerable to the patriots of Hong Kong and the 700 million people of China.

Patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, further mobilize and organize, bravely fight against the evil British imperialism! Be ready at any time to respond to the call of the great motherland, smashing the reactionary rule of British imperialism! The fate of Hong Kong depends on the patriots of Hong Kong and the 700 million people of China, not on the decaying and corrupt British imperialism.

Patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, fight bravely! The millions of Red Guards who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution support you, and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses support you. The 700 million people of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are sworn to be the strong backing of the patriots of Hong Kong.

Patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, march forward bravely towards great victory!

    坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅
    一场反抗英帝国主义血腥迫害的伟大战斗，在香港爆发了。从五月初以来，香港爱国同胞不顾英国军警的武力镇压，高举《毛主席语录》，涌上了街头。各行各业的工人纷纷宣布罢工和停工。他们前赴后继，不怕牺牲，同英国军警和暴徒展开英勇的搏斗。这场轰轰烈烈的大规模的反帝群众运动，正在猛烈发展中。
    香港英国当局，不顾我国政府的一再警告，不但没有对他们制造的法西斯暴行低头认罪，反而变本加厉地向中国人民挑衅。他们继续非法逮捕和审讯我爱国同胞，对被捕者实行骇人听闻的毒打和虐杀。他们颁布了一连串的所谓“紧急法令”，制造“迫害有理、抗暴有罪”的“法律根据”，企图以更大规模的搜捕和迫害，扑灭我爱国同胞的反帝抗暴斗争。他们还开来了航空母舰，公开叫嚷要“显示力量”。英帝国主义简直发疯到了极点！
    英帝国主义以为靠几根警棍，几道法令，几条军舰，就可以把中国人民吓倒。这完全是痴心妄想。有压迫就有反抗。香港的爱国同胞说得好，港英当局的暴行“升级”，抗英斗争也就要“升级”。他们警告英帝国主义者：这场斗争还刚刚开了个头，更加威武雄壮、更加气壮山河的战斗还在后边！我港九爱国同胞既然已经展开了反击，就一定要坚持斗争，抗顽敌，追穷寇，把英帝国主义斗垮，斗臭！
    英帝国主义是香港万恶的殖民统治者，是香港四百万中国同胞的敌人，七亿中国人民的敌人。一百多年来，这个腐朽的、野蛮的帝国主义，对我港九同胞进行了残酷的压迫。香港的军警、特务、法庭、监狱等等，都是压迫我港九同胞的工具。英帝国主义敲骨吸髓地掠夺和剥削我港九同胞，使我广大同胞陷于贫困的境地。它还用最腐朽、最堕落的西方文化，来毒化和腐蚀我港九同胞。近年来，英国政府又勾结美帝国主义，力图把香港变成美国侵越战争的基地和反华的基地。英国殖民统治下的香港，是罪恶的渊薮，黑暗的地狱。一百多年来，英帝国主义在香港干尽了坏事，血债累累，罪恶滔天，必须清算！
    港九爱国同胞正在进一步同英帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争。英帝国主义是一个反面教员，他们用法西斯暴行，迫使港九同胞展开一场仇视、鄙视和蔑视英帝国主义的运动，从政治上、经济上和文化上采取一切可能的行动，向英帝国主义的殖民统治发动强大的反击。一定要大张旗鼓地、千军万马地揭发和宣传英帝国主义一百多年来在香港犯下的滔天罪行，发动群众进行血泪的控诉，让香港的同胞家喻户晓，使他们彻底地认清侵略成性的英帝国主义的反动腐朽的本质。
    这一场斗争，主要地应当依靠香港的工人阶级，他们是革命的主力军。还应当充分地发动广大的青年学生，使青年学生运动同工人运动结合起来。以香港的工人阶级为核心，发动香港广泛阶层的爱国同胞，把斗争的矛头集中地指向美英帝国主义，首先是指向直接统治香港的英帝国主义。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    不管英帝国主义目前在香港多么嚣张，多么猖狂，只要香港的爱国同胞进一步团结起来，组织起来，结成浩浩荡荡的革命队伍，展开波澜壮阔的反帝群众运动，就能够形成一座真正的革命的铜墙铁壁，这是英帝国主义所绝对打不破的。相反，万恶的英帝国主义却要在这座铜墙铁壁面前碰得粉身碎骨！
    英帝国主义继续在香港胡作非为，对我爱国同胞进行血腥迫害，这是香港爱国同胞所绝对不能容忍的，是七亿中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    港九爱国同胞们，进一步动员起来，组织起来，勇猛地向着万恶的英帝国主义展开斗争吧！随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，粉碎英帝国主义的反动统治！香港的命运取决于香港爱国同胞，取决于七亿中国人民，而决不取决于腐败衰朽的英帝国主义。
    港九爱国同胞们，英勇地战斗吧！在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大胜利的祖国千百万红卫兵支持着你们，亿万革命群众支持着你们。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，誓作香港爱国同胞的强大后盾。
    港九爱国同胞们，向着伟大的胜利奋勇前进吧！
