Every revolutionary youth should strive to be a person with hope, a person beneficial to the people, a red successor. A truly hopeful person is one who arms their mind with Mao Zedong Thought, not someone who seeks personal gain and is full of selfish thoughts. A truly hopeful person is someone who thinks deeply, not someone who seeks to stand out.

Some comrades do not seriously distinguish between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, nor do they differentiate between the two types of contradictions. Instead, they doubt everything and attack everything, not treating the current political struggle with a serious attitude. Some comrades replace policy with emotion. Not only do they not stop armed struggles, but they themselves also participate in them.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a serious class struggle. Proletarian revolutionaries must conduct this serious class struggle by thoroughly studying Chairman Mao's works and strictly following Chairman Mao's instructions. As Comrade Lin Biao teaches us: ...we must always pay attention to and care about political situations, policies, and line-oriented issues, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and avoid wavering and losing direction in the face of major issues.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the question before each of us is: will we be a fleeting figure or a revolutionary youth who forever preserves his revolutionary spirit? Our answer should be the latter, not the former. To achieve this, we must always remember Comrade Lin Biao's teachings: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." We must always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must use the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought to analyze everything and guide all our actions. We must not seek personal gain, not form factions, have a heart for the country, look to the world, break down selfishness, and establish public-mindedness. We must forever take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our guiding principles. Then, we will definitely become truly hopeful people, that is, people beneficial to the people.

    做一个有希望的人
    我们每一个革命的青少年，都应该争取做一个有希望的人，做一个有益于人民的人，做一个红色的接班人。而真正有希望的人，是能用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑的人，而不是投机取巧，满脑子“私”字的人。真正有希望的人，是能想问题的人，不是出风头的人。
    有的同志不去认真分清是无产阶级司令部还是资产阶级司令部，不去分清两类不同性质的矛盾，而是怀疑一切，打倒一切，不是以严肃的态度来对待当前的政治斗争。还有些同志以感情代替政策。不但不去制止武斗，反而自己也参加武斗。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场严肃的阶级斗争。无产阶级革命派要进行这场严肃的阶级斗争，就一定要好好地学习毛主席著作，严格按照毛主席的指示办事。要象林副统帅所教导我们的：……时时刻刻关心和注意政治形势、政策、路线等方向性的问题，站稳立场，分清是非，避免在大是大非面前摇摆不定、迷失方向。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，摆在我们每个人面前的问题是：做昙花一现的人物呢，还是做永葆无产阶级革命青春的闯将？我们的回答应该是后者，决不是前者。要做到这一点，必须牢记林副统帅的教导：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。要用伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想去分析一切事物，去指导自己的一切行动。不出风头，不搞山头，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，破私立公，永远把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学。那么，我们就一定能成为真正有希望的人，即有益于人民的人。
