The proletarian revolutionary factions of our country have united to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, achieving a great victory.

This great victory has sparked a strong reaction worldwide. All genuine Marxist-Leninists and proletarian revolutionaries have enthusiastically hailed our great victory. However, the Soviet revisionist clique, like imperialists and reactionaries in various countries, is terrified and seething with rage. On one hand, they block the true information about the power struggle of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries, and on the other, they mobilize their propaganda machinery to spread rumors and slander, viciously cursing the power struggle of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries.

"Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The more the Soviet revisionist clique vigorously opposes us, the more it proves that our seizure of power is correct, good, and justified, with great world significance.

The fundamental issue in revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is still the issue of power

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries struggle to the death against the revolutionary forces precisely to maintain their power."

Even after the proletariat seizes power and establishes the dictatorship of the proletariat, the issue of power remains the fundamental issue of the revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He summed up the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship in our country and internationally, especially the lessons of the "peaceful evolution" and capitalist restoration carried out by the Khrushchev clique in the Soviet Union. In his series of great works and instructions, in his personal initiation and leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he correctly solved a series of problems of contemporary proletarian revolution, solved the theoretical and practical problems of conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao tells us: Throughout the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle still exists, and the focus of class struggle is still concentrated on the issue of power. The proletariat seeks to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. The most dangerous enemies attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat are the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of the proletarian dictatorship, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Our country is a great country under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our proletarian dictatorship is solid. In our country, fundamentally, it is the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie, who are in power. However, within our organs of the proletarian dictatorship, a handful of bourgeois representatives, namely the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, have infiltrated. These reactionaries, in the regions and departments they control, hang the sign of the proletarian dictatorship but practice bourgeois dictatorship. If they are not overthrown, once the time is ripe, they will seize power like the Khrushchev clique and carry out capitalist restoration nationwide. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to root them out, and to seize back the party, government, economic, and cultural powers they had usurped. This is a great innovation and a brilliant example of conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration.

The Soviet revisionist clique distorts our seizure of power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party as a seizure of power from the proletariat and the Chinese people, slandering our power struggle as an attempt to "shatter the people's power organs that have become a common phenomenon" and to "tear up the Constitution of the People's Republic of China."

How absurd and laughable!

The people will never "shatter" their own power organs. Only the enemies of the people attempt to "shatter the people's power organs." Was it not the enemies of the Soviet people—the Khrushchev clique—that "shattered" the organs of the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union? Was it not the enemies of the Chinese people—the Chinese Khrushchevs—who attempted to "shatter" the organs of the proletarian dictatorship in our country? As for what the proletarian revolutionary factions want to "shatter," it is absolutely not the "people's power organs," but the organs that have been usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and practice bourgeois dictatorship. We must thoroughly shatter them, and only in this way can we consolidate the "people's power organs" and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The people will never "tear up" their own constitution. Only the enemies of the people attempt to "tear up" the constitution of the proletariat. The Soviet revisionist clique talks about the constitution but avoids the issue of power. What is the constitution? The fundamental content of the constitution is to determine which class holds power. Any class first seizes power and then formulates its own constitution. The revolutionary class is like this, and the reactionary class is also like this. The Khrushchev clique did not first amend the constitution but first seized power. The Chinese Khrushchevs also want to do the same. Therefore, the proletariat must not think that having its own constitution means the enemy will not seize power. Otherwise, it will be foolish and lose power. We must remember Lenin's teaching: "Without power, any law, any elected body is worthless."

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are the main targets of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat

Chairman Mao teaches us: Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution.

The main targets of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of the proletarian dictatorship, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the danger of capitalist restoration comes from many directions. The most significant danger comes from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Because they have infiltrated the Party, they use the "Communist Party member" label, wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, attempting to attack our fortress from within. They use the power and positions they have usurped to suppress the proletariat and protect the bourgeoisie. They are eager to take the capitalist road and strive to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao said: "The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Therefore, the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have a fundamental contradiction with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This is the main contradiction under the dictatorship of the proletariat, an antagonistic contradiction. Solving this contradiction is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

To exonerate the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Party, the Soviet revisionist clique falsely claims that only "genuine capitalists" are the "true representatives of bourgeois intentions," and that there are no "capitalist-roaders" among "Party members," "cadres," and "party and government leaders."

Who can be deceived by such arguments? Everyone knows that Khrushchev, claiming to be of "miner" origin, is not a "genuine capitalist," but a typical bourgeois representative. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny and the like, probably never owned a big business, but are now the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Soviet Party. The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Party are not "genuine capitalists," but the total representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. Isn't this the case?

Why does the Soviet revisionist clique show such "deep sympathy" for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Party and go to great lengths to defend them? The answer is: when the rabbit dies, the fox mourns; when one of their kind is injured, they feel the pain.

Seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is a mass movement from the bottom up

Chairman Mao said: "We have always advocated that revolution must rely on the masses, with everyone participating, and oppose relying only on a few people to issue orders."

Our proletarian revolutionary factions seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is not a top-down demotion and reorganization, but a mass movement from the bottom up, personally initiated and supported by Chairman Mao. Only such a mass movement from the bottom up can root out all the big and small capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party, expose and criticize them thoroughly, and overthrow them completely; can seize back the party, government, economic, and cultural powers they have usurped, thoroughly eliminate the old bourgeois things; can fully mobilize the wisdom and initiative of the broad masses, create new organizational forms of the state organs of the proletarian dictatorship that are more suitable for the socialist economic base, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses." Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses form a vast revolutionary army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, educating and liberating themselves, and fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party for power. Who has ever seen such a magnificent scene? However, the Soviet revisionist clique slanders this as not a "mass people's movement," but a "coup d'état by the upper echelons."

I ask the Soviet revisionists:

Is the great movement participated in by hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals not a "mass people's movement"? Then, who are the "people"? Who are the "masses"?

The power struggle of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary factions against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party has received strong support from the People's Liberation Army of China. The People's Liberation Army of China responds to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly supports the broad leftist masses, arms the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and serves as a strong backbone for the revolutionary masses in the power struggle, performing immortal feats.

The People's Liberation Army of China is an army created by Chairman Mao, highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready. The People's Liberation Army of China firmly supports the power struggle of the broad leftist masses, which is a great revolutionary action and a brilliant example in the history of the international proletarian dictatorship. Only traitors of the proletariat would say this is a "reactionary military coup."

Then, has there ever been a "reactionary military coup" under the dictatorship of the proletariat? Yes, there was one in Hungary, and there was one in the Soviet Union. Who doesn't know that in 1957, the Khrushchev clique, to seize power, mobilized the army to surround the Kremlin? Therefore, the proletariat of various countries that have seized power must be vigilant against Khrushchev-style figures launching counter-revolutionary military coups. Otherwise, they will lose their heads without knowing why. In the great mass movement, revolutionary organs of the proletarian dictatorship have been established

Chairman Mao proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the principle of revolutionary "three-in-one combination" must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. This power organ is called the Revolutionary Committee.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ is composed of responsible persons from genuine representative revolutionary mass organizations, representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres. The responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations represent the broad masses, which is the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ. Revolutionary leading cadres play a backbone and core role. The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is the political and organizational guarantee for the victory of the power struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions. Through the transitional stage of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, the proletariat and revolutionary masses of our country will create new organizational forms of the state organs of the proletarian dictatorship that are more suitable for the socialist economic base, further enriching and developing the experience of the Paris Commune and the Soviets. Regarding the development of the organizational forms of the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Lenin once said: "The Paris Commune took the first step of world historical significance on this road, and the Soviet power took the second step." Now, the Chinese proletariat and revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are taking the "third step."

To belittle the great significance of the power struggle of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary factions seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party from the bottom up in the history of the international proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Soviet revisionist clique falsely claims that comparing our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the Paris Commune is a "sacrilegious act," is "making people forget the October Revolution of 1917," and so on. This is completely a distortion of black and white, a vicious slander.

What is the main experience of the Paris Commune? Marx pointed out that the most important experience of the Paris Commune is that the proletariat must not accept the ready-made state machine of the bourgeoisie but must thoroughly smash it. Since the Soviet revisionist clique has turned the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and restored the bourgeois state machine that had been smashed, where is there even a trace of the principles of the Paris Commune?

What is the main experience of the Soviets? Lenin said: "This new state organ is suitable for the dictatorship of the proletariat and for the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie to win over the non-proletarian laboring masses." But what about the Soviet revisionist clique? They abolished the dictatorship of the proletariat and implemented the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. They turned Lenin's revolutionary Soviets into a bourgeois parliament. These traitors of the proletariat, shamelessly, talk about the Paris Commune and the Soviets. Isn't this a "sacrilege" against the Paris Commune and the Soviets?

The vicious attacks of the Soviet revisionist clique on the power struggle of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary factions cannot in the slightest diminish the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our country on the Soviet people. Although the power has been temporarily usurped by the revisionist clique in Lenin's hometown, clouds cannot cover the sun. The Soviet people, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will surely stage another "October Revolution" to end the counter-revolutionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique.

    无产阶级夺权有理
    ——驳苏联修正主义集团诬蔑我国无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的谬论
    山东省革命委员会宣传部理论研究组
    我国无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，已经取得了伟大胜利。
    这个伟大胜利在全世界引起了强烈的反响。一切真正的马克思列宁主义者和无产阶级革命派，都热烈欢呼我们的伟大胜利。而苏联修正主义集团却和帝国主义、各国反动派一样，吓得胆战心惊，恨得咬牙切齿。他们一方面封锁我国无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的真实消息，另方面又开动宣传机器，造谣诽谤，无耻地咒骂我国无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。
    “被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。苏联修正主义集团越是起劲地反对我们，越是证明我们这个权夺得对，夺得好，夺得有理，具有伟大的世界意义。
    无产阶级专政条件下革命的根本问题仍然是政权问题
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    在无产阶级取得政权，建立无产阶级专政之后，政权问题依然是革命的根本问题。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他总结了我国和国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是赫鲁晓夫集团在苏联实行“和平演变”、复辟资本主义的教训。在他一系列伟大著作和指示中，在他亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中，正确地解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。
    毛主席告诉我们：在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期，仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争，而阶级斗争的焦点仍然集中在政权问题上。无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。而妄图推翻无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人，就是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    我们的国家是伟大的无产阶级专政的国家。我们的无产阶级专政的政权是巩固的。在我们国家里，从根本上说，当权的是无产阶级，而不是资产阶级。但是，在我们的无产阶级专政机构内部，也混进了一小撮资产阶级代表人物，即党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这些反动家伙，在他们盘踞的一些地区和部门，挂着无产阶级专政的招牌，实行资产阶级专政。如果不把他们打倒，一旦时机成熟，他们就会象赫鲁晓夫集团那样，篡夺政权，在全国范围内实行资本主义复辟。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发动亿万革命群众，把他们揪了出来，把他们窃取的党、政、财、文大权，重新夺了回来。这是无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的伟大创举和光辉典范。
    苏联修正主义集团把我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，歪曲成为向无产阶级和中国人民夺权，诬蔑我们的夺权斗争，是要“粉碎已成为通常现象的人民政权机构”，是要“把中华人民共和国宪法撕得粉碎”。
    这是何等的荒唐可笑！
    人民绝不会“粉碎”人民自己的政权机构。只有人民的敌人，才企图“粉碎人民政权机构”。难道不正是苏联人民的敌人——赫鲁晓夫集团“粉碎”了苏联的无产阶级专政机构吗？难道不正是中国人民的敌人——中国的赫鲁晓夫们妄图“粉碎”我国无产阶级专政机构吗？至于我们无产阶级革命派所要“粉碎”的，绝不是“人民政权机构”，而是那些被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺了领导权、实行资产阶级专政的机构。我们就是要彻底粉碎它们，只有这样，才能巩固“人民政权机构”，才能加强无产阶级专政。
    人民绝不会把自己的宪法“撕得粉碎”。只有人民的敌人才企图把无产阶级的宪法“撕得粉碎”。苏联修正主义集团空谈宪法，竭力回避政权问题。什么是宪法？宪法的根本内容就是规定政权属于哪一个阶级。任何一个阶级，总是先夺取政权，然后才制定自己的宪法。革命阶级是这样，反动阶级也是这样。赫鲁晓夫集团不是先修改宪法，而是先夺取政权。中国的赫鲁晓夫们也是要这样做的。所以，无产阶级绝不要认为有了自己的宪法，敌人就不会篡夺政权。否则，就是糊涂人，就会丧失政权。我们要牢记列宁的教导：“如果没有政权，无论什么法律，无论什么选出的机关都等于零。”
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象
    毛主席教导我们：谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。
    在无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，就是混进无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，资本主义复辟的危险来自多方面。其中，最主要的危险是来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。由于他们混进了党内，他们就利用“共产党员”的招牌，打着“红旗”反红旗，企图从内部攻破我们的堡垒。他们利用窃取的权力和阵地，来镇压无产阶级，保护资产阶级。他们热中于走资本主义道路，一心要变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。毛主席说：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”所以广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是无产阶级专政条件下的主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的集中表现。
    苏联修正主义集团为了替中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开脱罪责，胡说什么只有“地地道道的资本家”，才是“资产阶级意图的真正体现者”，而在
  “党员”、“干部”、“党政领导人”中是不会有“走资本主义道路的”资产阶级代表人物的。
    这种论调又能骗得了谁呢？谁都知道，赫鲁晓夫自称“矿工”出身，并非“地地道道的资本家”，却是典型的资产阶级代表人物。勃列日涅夫、柯西金、波德戈尔内之流，大概也没当过大老板，现在却是苏联党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，也并非“地地道道的资本家”，却是混入我国无产阶级专政机构内的资产阶级总代表。事实难道不正是这样的吗？
    苏联修正主义集团为什么对中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，如此“深表同情”，千方百计为他们辩解呢？答曰：兔死狐悲，物伤其类。
    向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权是自下而上的群众运动
    毛主席说：“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”
    我们无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权，不是自上而下的撤职和改组，而是由毛主席亲自号召和支持的自下而上的群众运动。只有这种自下而上的群众运动，才能把一小撮大大小小的混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派统统揪出来，批深批透，斗倒斗臭；才能把他们窃取的党、政、财、文大权重新夺到无产阶级手里，彻底清除资产阶级的旧东西；才能充分发挥广大群众的智慧和首创精神，创造出更适合社会主义经济基础的、无产阶级专政国家机构的新的组织形式，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    “这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了。”亿万革命群众组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争，有谁曾见过这样惊天动地的伟大场面啊！但是，苏联修正主义集团却诬蔑“这不是一次群众性的人民运动”，而是一次“上层政变”。
    请问苏修老爷们：
    亿万工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子参加的伟大运动，竟然不是“一次群众性的人民运动”，那么，究竟谁是“人民”？谁是“群众”？
    我国无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，得到了中国人民解放军的大力支持。中国人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决支持左派广大群众，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，做革命群众的坚强后盾，在夺权斗争中立下了不朽的功勋。
    中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的、非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的军队。中国人民解放军坚决支持左派广大群众的夺权斗争，是伟大的革命行动，是国际无产阶级专政历史上的光辉典范。只有无产阶级的叛徒，才会胡说这是什么“反动的军事政变”。
    那么，在无产阶级专政条件下有没有发生过“反动的军事政变”呢？有，匈牙利发生过，苏联也发生过。谁不知道，在一九五七年，赫鲁晓夫集团为了争夺政权，调动军队包围了克里姆林宫？所以，取得了政权的各国无产阶级，必须注意防止赫鲁晓夫式的人物发动反革命军事政变。否则，丢了脑袋还不知道是怎么回事。在伟大的群众运动中，建立了无产阶级专政的临时权力机构
    毛主席提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。
    革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，由真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军代表、革命的领导干部组成。革命群众组织负责人所代表的广大群众是革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构的基础。革命的领导干部起骨干和核心作用。人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石。
    革命的“三结合”是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争胜利的政治保证和组织保证。经过革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构这一过渡，我国无产阶级和革命群众，将创造出更加适合社会主义经济基础的、无产阶级专政机构的新的组织形式，进一步丰富和发展巴黎公社的经验和苏维埃的经验。关于无产阶级专政的政权组织形式的发展，列宁曾这样说过：“巴黎公社在这条道路上走了具有全世界历史意义的第一步，苏维埃政权走了第二步。”现在，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国无产阶级和革命群众正在走着“第三步”。
    苏联修正主义集团为了贬低我国无产阶级革命派自下而上地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争，在国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政历史上所具有的伟大意义，胡说什么把我国的文化大革命与巴黎公社相提并论是“亵渎行为”，是“使人们忘掉一九一七年的十月革命”等等。这完全是颠倒黑白，无耻诽谤。
    巴黎公社的主要经验是什么？马克思指出，巴黎公社的最主要的经验，就是无产阶级决不能接受资产阶级现成的国家机器，而必须彻底把它打碎。苏联修正主义集团既然把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，把已经打碎了的资产阶级国家机器重新恢复起来，哪里还有一丝一毫的巴黎公社原则的影子呢？
    苏维埃的主要经验是什么？列宁说：“这个新的国家机关是适合于无产阶级专政的，是适合于无产阶级为争取非无产阶级劳动群众而反对资产阶级的斗争的。”可是，苏联修正主义集团怎么样呢？他们取消了无产阶级专政，实行了资产阶级专政。他们把列宁的革命的苏维埃变成了资产阶级的议会。这些无产阶级的叛徒，竟厚颜无耻地来谈论巴黎公社和苏维埃，这不是对巴黎公社和苏维埃的“亵渎”，又是什么呢？
    苏联修正主义集团对我国无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的恶毒攻击，丝毫也抵销不了我国无产阶级文化大革命在苏联人民中产生的巨大影响。在列宁的故乡，虽然暂时被修正主义集团篡夺了政权，但是，乌云是遮不住太阳的。具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，肯定要再来一次“十月革命”，结束苏联修正主义集团的反革命统治。
