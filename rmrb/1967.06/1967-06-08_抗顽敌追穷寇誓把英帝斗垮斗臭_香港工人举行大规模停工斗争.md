	Hong Kong workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless in the face of the armed suppression by the Hong Kong British authorities. They stand hand in hand, arm in arm, and engage in a courageous struggle against the enemy.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 7th: More than a thousand workers from the cargo warehouses, tugboats, ferries, docks, loading, cranes, and freight services of Kowloon Dock, which controls Hong Kong's overseas maritime transportation, held a large-scale half-day strike on the morning of the 6th. During the strike, 35 overseas ships docked at Hong Kong and Kowloon Dock ceased loading and unloading cargo, halting Hong Kong's overseas maritime operations, except for China's maritime ships in Hong Kong.

	During the strike, the workers held a protest meeting. The workers pointed out at the meeting that British imperialism has owed a blood debt to the workers and compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon for over a hundred years. Now, they are once again carrying out fascist bloody suppression against us. We workers will never forget the old grudges and new hatreds. We must settle accounts with British imperialism. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory." The workers said, we resolutely respond to the call of our great socialist motherland and launch a mass movement to hate, despise, and ridicule British imperialism. We will fight to the end, pursue the fleeing enemy, and vow to fight British imperialism to the ground and make it stink!

	After the protest meeting, the workers held a grand demonstration on the pier inside Kowloon Dock. Wherever the workers' demonstration team went, big-character posters and slogans covered the docks, walls, doors, windows, cranes, and bridges. Slogans such as "Be ready at any time to respond to the motherland's call and smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism" and "Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao!" echoed through the skies of South Kowloon Pier.

	On the morning of the 6th, the cargo handlers of Hong Kong and Kowloon also held a strike, fighting side by side with the workers of Kowloon Dock.

	On the 6th, 3,800 garment workers also struck for a day and held a meeting to condemn the fascist atrocities of British imperialism.
