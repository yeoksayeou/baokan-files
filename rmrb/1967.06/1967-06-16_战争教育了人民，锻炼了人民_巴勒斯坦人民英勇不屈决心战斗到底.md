War has educated and tempered the people. The Palestinian people are brave and unyielding, determined to fight to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Cairo on the 14th, the Secretary-General of the Palestinian Writers' Association, Helal Hamad, said on the 13th in Cairo to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the current U.S.-British-Israeli aggression against Arab countries: "The U.S. puppet Israel currently occupies our land. However, the enemy can never conquer our fighting spirit." After this battle, the Palestinian people are even more filled with the fire of revenge and are more determined to fight for their country to the last person.

At the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Cairo, two Palestinians who managed to escape by boat from Gaza to Cairo said: "Gaza is now under Israeli military occupation. The Zionists have carried out massacres. The Jabaliya and coastal refugee camps near Gaza City have been leveled by Israeli bombs and tanks. In Khan Yunis, about three thousand Palestinians have been massacred. But the people's resistance has never stopped."

These two Palestinians recalled that on June 5th, the Israeli army, with the cover of more than sixty tanks, launched a mad attack on Khan Yunis. The Palestinians in this city had resisted for five days during the 1956 Anglo-French-Israeli invasion. This time, many Palestinian refugees took up hunting rifles, swords, grenades, and even clubs to fight side by side with their own army, resisting the invaders. The Israeli army's first-day attack was finally defeated by the brave Palestinian soldiers and civilians, leaving behind twenty-eight damaged tanks and many corpses. After the Israelis occupied the city, the residents continued to resist in the streets.

According to the reporter, in the Gaza Strip occupied by Israel, Palestinian fighters are still very active, sniping at the enemy everywhere, and the sound of landmines planted by Palestinian soldiers and civilians exploding can often be heard. The Israeli invaders are anxious, and a curfew of eighteen hours is still in effect every day.

    战争教育了人民，锻炼了人民
    巴勒斯坦人民英勇不屈决心战斗到底
    据新华社开罗十四日电　巴勒斯坦作家协会秘书长赫尔·哈马德十三日在开罗对新华社记者谈到这次美英以侵略阿拉伯国家的战争时强调说：“美国走狗以色列目前占领了我们的土地。但是，敌人决不能征服我们的斗志。”经过这次战斗烈火的锻炼，巴勒斯坦人民更加满怀复仇的怒火，更加有决心为祖国战斗到最后一个人。
    在巴勒斯坦解放组织驻开罗办事处，两位设法乘小船从加沙来到开罗的巴勒斯坦人说：“加沙现在处在以色列军占领下。犹太复国主义进行了大屠杀。在加沙城附近的贾比亚和海岸难民营，已被以色列的炸弹和坦克夷为平地。在汉尤尼斯，约有三千名巴勒斯坦人民被屠杀。但是，人民的抵抗一天也没有停止过。”
    这两位巴勒斯坦人追述说，六月五日，以色列军队在六十多辆坦克的掩护下，向汉尤尼斯发动了疯狂的进攻。这座城市的巴勒斯坦人民在一九五六年英法以三国侵略期间，曾坚持抵抗了五天。这一次，许多巴勒斯坦难民又拿起猎枪、刀剑、手榴弹以至棍棒，同自己的军队并肩作战，抗击侵略者。以色列头一天的进攻终于被英勇的巴勒斯坦军民打败了，留下了二十八辆被打坏的坦克和许多尸体。在以色列占领了这座城市以后，那里的居民继续在街道上进行抵抗。
    据记者获悉，在被以色列占领的加沙地带，巴勒斯坦战士仍十分活跃，到处狙击敌人，不时可以听到由巴勒斯坦军民埋置的地雷的爆炸声。以色列侵略军惶惶不安，每天还实行十八小时的宵禁。
