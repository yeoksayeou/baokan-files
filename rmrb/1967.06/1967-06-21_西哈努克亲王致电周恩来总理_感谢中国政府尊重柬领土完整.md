Prince Sihanouk Cables Premier Zhou Enlai, Thanking the Chinese Government for Respecting Cambodia's Territorial Integrity

	NEW DELHI, June 19 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on June 19, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk cabled Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing gratitude to the Chinese government for reaffirming its principled stance of fully respecting Cambodia's territorial integrity within its current borders.

	The cable said: "I and the Cambodian people are very pleased to learn of the Chinese government's statement on June 13, which declared that the Chinese government respects Cambodia's territorial integrity within its current borders and once again condemned the aggression of American imperialists against our country. Please allow me to express our gratitude to you and to the Chinese government and people for this valuable support and assistance."

	The cable said: "Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people steadfastly support Cambodia and the Cambodian people in their resolute opposition to the evil schemes and tricks of American imperialists and their lackeys in Thailand and South Vietnam."

	The cable wished for the further strengthening of friendship between Cambodia and China.

	NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) - The Cambodian newspaper "New Telegraph" published an editorial on June 15, hailing the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on June 13, which fully respects Cambodia's territorial integrity within its current borders. The editorial said: "The Chinese statement quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's words: 'The People's Republic of China has always sought to establish and develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has pursued a policy of good neighborliness toward all neighboring countries.' The great leader of the Chinese people has always adhered to this principled stance in his friendly policy toward our country. We have always felt this principled stance. Recently, our Cambodian-Chinese friendship has once again been proven."

	The editorial said that the Cambodian people have never doubted the sincere friendship and unwavering support from the people of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong. Cambodia already knows how to distinguish true friends from false ones. The Chinese people are comrades and brothers of the Cambodian people in their struggle against imperialism and reactionary forces. The Chinese people have always stood firmly on the side of the Cambodian people, whether the situation is favorable or difficult. The editorial concluded by warning that those American imperialists and their lackeys who hope to create discord between Cambodia and friendly China should learn some lessons from their failures. "Enemies who oppose our country's truly independent political and economic policies should understand that they cannot succeed in overthrowing or destroying the wall of unity that maintains our two countries' friendly relations."

    西哈努克亲王致电周恩来总理
    感谢中国政府尊重柬领土完整
    新华社金边十九日电  据柬埔寨新闻社十九日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王打电报给周恩来总理，表示感谢中国政府重申完全尊重柬埔寨在目前边界内的领土完整的严正立场。
    电报说：“我和柬埔寨全国人民非常高兴地获悉中国政府六月十三日发表的声明，声明宣告中国政府尊重柬埔寨目前边界内的领土完整，并再次谴责美帝国主义者对我国的侵略。请允许我向你，并向中国政府和人民，对这种宝贵的声援和支持表示我们的感激。”
    电报说：“在毛泽东主席英明领导下的中国人民，坚定不移地支持柬埔寨和柬埔寨人民坚决反对美帝国主义者及其泰国和南越等走狗的罪恶勾当和阴谋诡计。”
    电报祝愿柬埔寨和中国两国之间的友谊进一步加强。
    新华社金边电　柬埔寨《新电讯报》十五日发表社论，欢呼中华人民共和国外交部十三日发表的关于完全尊重柬埔寨目前边界内的领土完整的声明。社论说：“中国的声明引用了毛泽东主席的话：‘中华人民共和国一贯寻求在平等互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的基础上建立和发展同一切国家的友好关系，并且对所有邻国执行睦邻政策。’中国人民伟大领袖的这些话，始终贯穿在友好的中国对我国所奉行的政治路线中。我们一直体会到这种严正立场。最近，我们柬中友谊又一次得到了证明。”
    社论说，柬埔寨人民一刻也没有怀疑过来自毛泽东主席领导下的人民中国的真诚友谊和始终不渝的支持。柬埔寨已经知道识别谁是真正的朋友和谁是假朋友。中国人民是柬埔寨人民反对帝国主义和反动势力的战友和兄弟。中国人民不论是在形势有利或困难的时候，都始终坚定地站在柬埔寨人民一边。社论最后警告说，希望在柬埔寨同友好的中国之间制造不和的美帝国主义者及其走狗们，现在该从它们的失败中汲取一些教训了。“敌视我国在政治上和在经济上真正独立的政策的敌人应该懂得，他们要推翻或者是破坏这堵维护我们两国友好关系的团结的墙，是不能得逞的。”
