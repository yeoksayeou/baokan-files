Guizhou Revolutionary Committee Studies and Implements Regulations from Shandong Revolutionary Committee and Adds Supplementary Regulations

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 26 - The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee issued a decision on studying the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of its standing committee on June 25 to study and discuss the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Everyone unanimously agreed that this is a document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is of great significance for our provincial revolutionary committee to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and to achieve proletarian revolutionary, combat-ready, and mass-oriented transformation. These ten measures are completely applicable to Guizhou, and we must resolutely respond and implement them without any deviation. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism in Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad work styles and maintain good work styles." We are determined to learn from the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. In addition to implementing the regulations of Shandong Province, we will add the following supplementary regulations based on our situation:

1. Members of the provincial revolutionary committee must place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the most important position, study the "Three Articles" diligently, overthrow private interests and establish public interests, and reform worldviews. They must persist in studying every day and become models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

2. Members of the provincial revolutionary committee must learn from the People's Liberation Army to emphasize proletarian politics, insist on the Four Firsts, personally handle ideological work, and not be busy with trivial matters. They should advocate for thinking deeply and doing solid political and ideological work.

3. Fully promote great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Good words, bad words, correct words, and wrong words should all be listened to. Within the revolutionary committee, democracy should be fully promoted, issues should be brought to the table, and the practice of one-person rule should be opposed. Using the conditions for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao, we should strictly demand of ourselves, frequently conduct criticism and self-criticism. Warmly welcome revolutionary masses to give suggestions to members of the revolutionary committee, post big-character posters, and supervise the work of the revolutionary committee.

4. Members of the revolutionary committee must closely connect with the masses, blend in with the masses, frequently go deep into the masses and actual situations, conduct investigations and research, and solve practical problems. Members of the revolutionary committee generally should not leave their original units and should work, live, and labor in their original units.

5. Trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. The revolutionary committee should fully play the active role of revolutionary leftists, especially young pioneers, and let them take the initiative and act, without taking over their work. Strengthen the representativeness of the revolutionary committee by selecting outstanding revolutionary organization leaders to various levels of revolutionary committees.

6. The structure of the revolutionary committee should be streamlined, reduce layers, and implement face-to-face leadership.

7. Based on the regulations of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and these supplementary regulations, the implementation situation should be checked every two months, promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and continue to advance!

                贵州省革命委员会
            一九六七年六月二十五日
    新华社贵阳二十六日电　《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》发表后，贵州省革命委员会于六月二十五日召开了有省革命委员会各办事机构负责人和贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部、省红代会负责人参加的常委扩大会议，认真学习和讨论了山东省革命委员会的规定和《红旗》杂志评论员的文章。在学习讨论中，大家一致认为，山东省革命委员会的规定，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的重要文件，完全适用于贵州，全省无产阶级革命派和各级革命委员会必须坚决响应，坚决照办。
    与会同志一致指出，山东省革命委员会的规定，对于贵州省革命委员会实现非常无产阶级革命化、战斗化、群众化，具有极其重大的现实意义，给我们无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，如何更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚持执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，指出了明确的道路。
    会议着重指出，要树立革命委员会的好作风，最根本、最关键的问题，是大学大用毛泽东思想，促进人的思想革命化。因此，革命委员会的成员，要坚持时时、事事活学活用毛主席著作，特别要狠学“老三篇”，破私立公，改造世界观，永远做一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的全心全意为人民服务的勤务员。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，必须密切联系群众，走群众路线，要以满腔的热忱来对待群众，决不能摆官架子。革命委员会的成员决不能以为掌了权就高人一等，而要以一个普通的劳动者的姿态出现，甘当群众的小学生。只有一刻也不脱离群众，才能永葆革命的青春，永远立于不败之地。
    常委扩大会议最后一致通过了贵州省革命委员会关于学习《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》的决定，根据贵州实际情况，研究和制定了贯彻执行山东省革命委员会规定的若干项措施。参加会议的同志纷纷表示，要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，贯彻执行山东省革命委员会的规定和贵州省革命委员会的补充规定，决心在思想、工作作风等各方面来一次革命，改革一切旧的工作作风和旧的规章制度，建立一个崭新的、适合革命需要的规章制度，实现人的思想革命化和工作的革命化，把贵州建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
