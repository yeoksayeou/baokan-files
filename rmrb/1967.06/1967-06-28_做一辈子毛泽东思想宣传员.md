		Dedicated to a Lifetime of Promoting Mao Zedong Thought
		Zhang Yingshe, Revolutionary Rebel Group of the Political Department's Art Troupe of the Air Force

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." My process of singing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics is a sharp class struggle. The class enemy fiercely opposed my singing, while revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically encouraged me to sing. Through this struggle, I was educated and tempered, and I love our most red, most red Red Sun, the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, even more. I will be a lifelong promoter of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In 1958, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the Party's general line, the people of the entire nation launched a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility urged me to keep up with the times and contribute to the people. I studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary writers and artists must link themselves with the masses, express the thoughts and feelings of the masses, and be the faithful spokesmen of the masses. Only then will their work have meaning." I thought, as a singer, how can I become a "faithful spokesman of the masses"? Our era has entered a new era of great Mao Zedong Thought. The great leader Chairman Mao enjoys enormous prestige throughout the nation and the world. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and soldiers is soaring. What is their language? Their language is the strongest sound of the times, and this strongest sound is none other than the language of our great leader Chairman Mao. At that time, I saw the song "Butterfly Loves Flowers" composed by Comrade Jiefu, and I was immediately attracted to it. At that time, I was ill and used the time to practice singing it, and performed it at a evening event organized by the hospital. Although my understanding of this poem was still very shallow, the performance was warmly welcomed by the convalescent comrades, which increased my confidence.

	In 1959, I participated in the Second National Military Art Festival. When selecting the program, I first decided on "Butterfly Loves Flowers." The Air Force leaders approved the program immediately and firmly supported it. When singing "Butterfly Loves Flowers," it was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, it was fiercely opposed and attacked by ghosts and snakes and capitalist-roaders within the Party. At that time, a bourgeois reactionary "authority" relied on the so-called "expert" title to "care" about such a small figure as me. He published an article in the newspaper criticizing my singing. More than eighty percent of the article was about how I sang "Butterfly Loves Flowers" excessively, how my performance was poor, how my voice was bad, and so on, picking at every detail, but not saying a word about whether it was politically correct or not. After reading the article, I was confused, but the capitalist-roaders in our troupe treated those reactionary "authorities" as gods. He said to me: "These old experts and old artists can write articles, which means they care about you!" As if their words were the ultimate truth. After the Air Force leaders learned about this, they encouraged me, saying: "Zhang Yingshe, I saw a small newspaper article criticizing you. Don't mind them, keep singing! You are not singing ordinary songs, but Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics!" A resolute word gave me great encouragement and strength.

	Later, I practiced singing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics "Beidaihe" and "Expelling the Plague," which were even more warmly welcomed by the masses. However, some people with ulterior motives blew cold wind again, saying: "What you sing is not popular, but elevated, workers, peasants, and soldiers don't want to listen!" They even said: "What you sing can only be listened to by people over sixty years old." These words were a great slander against our great leader. Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics are an important part of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant example of the unity of revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form, and a masterpiece of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. How can they only be listened to by the elderly? In 1961, with the black wind blowing in society, that reactionary academic "authority" jumped out again, writing an article in the newspaper commenting on my singing, talking about the actor's temperament, saying that I was only suitable for singing bright songs, only strong and not soft, and could not sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, attacking me again. The capitalist-roaders in my troupe also chimed in, saying: "You should be restrained, not just heroic." Another capitalist-roader said: "Learn more about Kunqu, sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, and the operatic flavor should be thick." They even threatened me fiercely: "You only sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, who will dare to write songs for you?"

	In 1961, the Party sent me to the Shanghai Vocal Research Institute for further study. A group of reactionary academic "authorities," seeing that I only sang Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, tried every means to obstruct me, saying: "You are a dramatic soprano, singing foreign songs can best showcase your talents, it's better to choose foreign songs!" They even forced me to sing foreign songs, but I firmly refused. In 1964, when I was assigned to go abroad, before my departure, the Air Force leaders asked me again, "Will you dare to sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics abroad?" "In a revisionist country, singing may get you a cold shoulder, or even have bricks thrown at you!" I said: "I dare to sing!" The leader said: "Good! Don't be afraid, just sing!"

	In my performances at home, I was always warmly welcomed. I once performed in a border defense company and saw soldiers carefully copying down Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics as inspiring slogans for revolutionary heroism. After listening to the performance, they encouraged me, saying: "You are not just a member of the art troupe, but also a propagandist. We want to listen to such songs." Recently, we performed at the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune, and the commune members requested to sing "Butterfly Loves Flowers." An old man listened happily and said: "The songs you sing, I have heard in the gramophone." When asked if he understood, he said: "I understand, Chairman Mao wrote it for us, how can I not understand!"

	Over the years, Chairman Mao's instructions on literature and art, and Comrade Lin Biao's teaching that "teaching a good song is actually a important political lesson," have always been my constant recitation. These teachings have shown me the way; the support and encouragement of the leaders have given me confidence; the love and welcome of the workers, peasants, and soldiers for Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics have given me great encouragement. Therefore, although I have encountered some difficulties, obstacles, and sabotage, my confidence has never wavered. I have realized that to sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics well, we must first solve the problems of why and how to sing. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Our singing is to sing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must stand firmly on their side, loving what they love and hating what they hate. First, be a firm revolutionary of the proletariat, and then it is possible to become a revolutionary literary and art worker. Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics are the strongest sound of our proletarian revolutionary era. When singing, we must have a serious attitude and full enthusiasm, and work hard to understand the meaning and historical background of each poem and lyric, seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant works, do detailed preparatory work, and then find a relatively correct song treatment plan. When singing, we must express our boundless love for the great leader. Without this, it is difficult to express the revolutionary spirit of Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, and it is also difficult to resonate emotionally with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	This unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has given me profound education and tempering. Our struggle in singing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics is not just an artistic issue, but a major issue of two classes, two lines, two worldviews, and two artistic views, a living class struggle. Why has the literary and art world been controlled by the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line for seventeen years? Why can the dead and foreigners control the stage, while promoting Mao Zedong Thought is "guilty" and subjected to exclusion and attack? It is because there is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party as the backer. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize and denounce the backer of revisionism in the literary and art world. In the future, I will strive to study Chairman Mao's works, earnestly understand the great political significance and lofty aspirations of Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics, and sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics better. Head can be cut off, blood can flow! I will definitely sing Chairman Mao's poems and lyrics!

    做一辈子毛泽东思想宣传员	    空军政治部文工团革命造反队　张映哲
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我演唱毛主席诗词歌曲的过程，就是一场尖锐的阶级斗争的过程。阶级敌人拚命反对我唱，革命领导干部和广大工农兵群众越热情鼓励我唱。在这场斗争中我受到了教育，得到了锻炼，我更加热爱我们心中最红最红的红太阳、全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席。我要做一辈子毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    一九五八年，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党的总路线的指引下，全国人民掀起了全面大跃进的高潮，革命的政治责任感促使着我觉得应该跟上形势，对人民有所贡献。我又一次学习了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席教导我们：“一切革命的文学家艺术家只有联系群众，表现群众，把自己当作群众的忠实的代言人，他们的工作才有意义。”我想，自己是一个歌唱演员，怎样才能成为“群众的忠实的代言人”呢？我们的时代进入了伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代，伟大的领袖毛主席在全国和全世界享有巨大的威望，工农兵群众的革命热情这样高涨，什么是他们的语言呢？他们的语言就是时代的最强音，而这最强音不是别的，正是我们伟大领袖毛主席的语言。当时，我看到了劫夫同志谱写的毛主席诗词歌曲《蝶恋花》，一下子就被吸引了。那时我正在病中，就利用时间练唱了它，并在医院组织的晚会上演唱了。尽管我对这首词的理解还很不够，但演唱却受到了休养员同志们的热烈欢迎，这使我增加了信心。
    一九五九年我参加全军二届文艺会演，选择节目时，我首先定下了《蝶恋花》。空军首长审查节目时，马上表示坚决支持。演唱《蝶恋花》这首歌时，也受到广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。但是却遭到了牛鬼蛇神和党内走资本主义道路当权派们的仇视和反对，他们采取各种办法打击我。当时有个资产阶级反动“权威”，倚仗着所谓“专家”的名牌，居然“关心”起我这样的小人物来了。他在报纸上发表文章，批评我的演唱。一篇小小的文章，百分之八十以上的篇幅是说我唱《蝶恋花》如何夸饰过度，表演如何不行，声音如何不好等等，评头品足，就是不谈一句政治方向上的对与错。我看了文章后思想不通，可是我们团内走资本主义道路当权派竟然把那帮反动“权威”奉若神明，他对我说：“这些老专家、老艺术家能写文章，就是很爱护你！”似乎他们的话就是金科玉律。空军首长知道这件事后，就鼓励我说：“张映哲，我看到小报有篇文章批评你，不要管他们，继续唱你的！你唱的不是一般的歌，是毛主席的诗词！”斩钉截铁的一句话，给了我巨大的鼓舞和力量。
    后来，我又练唱了毛主席的诗词《北戴河》、《送瘟神》等，更加受到群众的欢迎。可是，一些别有用心的人又吹阴风了，胡说什么：“你唱的不是普及的，是提高了的东西，工农兵不要听！”甚至胡说：“你唱的只能给六十岁以上的老人听。”这些话简直是对我们伟大领袖的极大诬蔑。毛主席诗词是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式统一的光辉典范，是革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的杰作，怎么只能给老人听呢？一九六一年，随着社会上刮起的一股黑风，那位反动学术“权威”又跳出来了，他又在报上写文章，评论我的演唱，大谈什么演员的秉性问题，说我只适于唱开朗的歌，只刚不柔，唱不了毛主席诗词，再次对我进行打击。我团走资本主义道路当权派也帮腔说：“你要含蓄，不要光豪迈。”另一个走资本主义道路当权派也说：“多学学昆曲，唱毛主席诗词，戏曲味要浓。”硬是要我把毛主席诗词唱得不伦不类，越古越好。他甚至恶狠狠地威胁我说：“你光唱毛主席诗词，谁还敢给你写歌啦。”
    一九六一年，党送我到上海声乐研究所进修时，一帮反动学术“权威”，见我净唱毛主席诗词，他们就想方设法地加以阻挠，说什么：“你是戏剧女高音，唱外国歌曲最能发挥才能，还是选唱外国歌曲好！”甚至强制规定我唱外国歌曲，可是我坚决拒绝了。一九六四年我接受出国任务，临出发前，空军首长又一次问我“在国外敢不敢唱毛主席诗词？”“在修正主义国家唱可能有人会给你坐冷板凳，甚至向你扔砖头！”我说：“敢唱！”，首长说“好！不要怕，就是要唱！”
    我在国内演出，每次都受到热烈欢迎。我曾在一个边防连队里，看到战士们把毛主席诗词精心抄录下来，当作激励革命英雄主义的警句。他们听完演唱后鼓励我说：“你不仅是个文工团员，还是个宣传鼓动员。我们就要听这样的歌。”最近，我们到中阿友好人民公社去演出，社员同志们要求唱《蝶恋花》，一位老大爷听了高兴地说：“你们唱的歌，我在戏匣子里听过。”问他懂不懂？他说：“懂，毛主席给我们写的，还不懂！”
    几年来，毛主席有关文学艺术的指示，和林副主席“教一个好的歌子，实际上也是一堂重要的政治课”的教导，一直是我经常默诵的。这些教导给我指明了路；领导同志的支持和鼓励给我增加了信心；工农兵观众对于毛主席诗词歌曲的热爱和欢迎，给了我极大的鼓舞。因此尽管碰到了一些困难、阻挠、破坏，但是始终没有动摇我的信心。我体会到：要比较好地演唱毛主席诗词，首先就要解决为什么唱和如何唱的问题。毛主席教导说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的”。我们歌唱就是要为工农兵而歌唱。要为工农兵服务，自己的立足点就一定要移到工农兵一边来，爱工农兵之所爱，恨工农兵之所恨。先做一个坚定的无产阶级革命者，才可能成为一个革命的文艺工作者。毛主席的诗词是我们无产阶级革命时代的最强音，演唱时一定要有严肃的态度和满腔的热情，切实下功夫去体会每首诗词的含意和时代背景，认真地学习毛主席有关的著作，作好细致的案头准备工作，然后再寻找比较正确的歌曲处理方案。演唱时更要倾诉出对于伟大领袖的无比热爱。不如此就很难表达出毛主席诗词的革命精神，不如此也很难和工农兵群众产生感情上的共鸣。
    这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，给了我极深刻的教育和锻炼。我们在演唱毛主席诗词上的斗争决不是一个艺术问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两种世界观、两种艺术观的大是大非问题，是活生生的阶级斗争。为什么十七年来，文艺界被反革命修正主义黑线专了政？为什么死人、洋人能统治舞台，而宣传毛泽东思想倒反“有罪”，受到排斥和打击呢？就是因为有党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这个总后台。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决彻底地把文艺界修正主义的总后台批深斗臭。今后，我决心更好地学习毛主席著作，努力领会毛主席诗词的伟大政治意义和崇高立意，把毛主席诗词演唱得更好些。头可断，血可流！毛主席诗词我是唱定了！
