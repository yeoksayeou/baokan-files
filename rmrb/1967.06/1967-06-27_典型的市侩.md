Title: Typical Bourgeoisie

The Soviet revisionist clique, in its so-called Central Committee resolution on the "Near East policy," hypocritically condemns the "treacherous actions" of "imperialist forces," which is truly nauseating.

Indeed, imperialism is untrustworthy. But the Soviet revisionists coming out to "condemn" imperialism's betrayals is like the crow laughing at the pig for being black.

In this Middle East incident, at the beginning, you promised "support" for the Arab countries, but when the Arab countries were invaded by the U.S. and Israel, you were as cowardly as mice, fleeing in a hurry, and throwing away your own "promises" completely. Isn't this betrayal?

After Israel invaded the Arab countries, not only did you not support the Arab countries in resisting the invaders, but you also colluded with U.S. imperialism to force the Arab countries to accept a "ceasefire." Isn't this double betrayal?

The reason why revisionists are revisionists is that they use all kinds of deceptive slogans to engage in treacherous acts of betraying the revolution. They speak beautifully with their mouths, all to deceive people, and they have no intention of implementing it. Therefore, they always end up contradicting themselves. Inconsistency between words and deeds, hypocrisy, flip-flopping, and betrayal are the common traits of all revisionists, determined by their reactionary class nature.

When Lenin denounced the traitor Kautsky, he pointed out that the policy of the Second International revisionism was "a typical policy of petty-bourgeois philistines."

Today's Soviet revisionist clique is a typical bunch of petty-bourgeois philistines. Where there is profit, they will go; where there is no profit, they will not do it, and they do not care about principles. Usually, they can say a few words about "anti-imperialism" and "supporting the struggles of the peoples of various countries," singing high notes; but when it comes to the crucial moment, they eat their own words, and not only do they not feel ashamed, but they even feel proud. Today they smile at you, and tomorrow they turn their backs on you. The Soviet revisionists have long been accustomed to such treacherous acts, making them a common occurrence. The peoples of the world have had enough of their tricks.

In the 1960 Congo (Kinshasa) incident, the Soviet revisionists, while claiming to "support" the Congolese (Kinshasa) people, also voted in the United Nations with U.S. imperialism to send "UN troops" to suppress the Congolese (Kinshasa) national liberation movement.

In the 1962 Caribbean crisis, the Soviet revisionists condemned the United States the day before, but the next day they were so scared that they kowtowed to the United States, betraying the Cuban people.

On the Vietnamese issue, the Soviet revisionists issued statements and speeches on the left and right, talking about their "friendship" with the Vietnamese people, but at every opportunity, they engaged in treacherous acts.

The Soviet revisionist clique has done such things in the past, and it will definitely continue to do so in the future. In its so-called resolution on the "Near East policy," it again pompously says: "to give full support to the peoples of various countries." However, before the ink of these words has dried, Kosygin began secret talks with Johnson in Glassboro, which is not another treacherous act against the Arab people and the people of the world?

From this, it can be seen that the counter-revolutionary nature of the Soviet revisionist clique is absolutely unchangeable. The only correct policy towards this bunch of shameless petty-bourgeois philistines is to resolutely expose them, resolutely struggle against them, and resolutely overthrow them.

    典型的市侩
    苏修集团在所谓苏共中央全会关于“近东政策”的决议中，装模作样地谴责“帝国主义势力”的“背信弃义行动”，实在是令人作呕。
    诚然，帝国主义是不讲信义的。但，苏修集团出来“骂”帝国主义背信弃义，不过是乌鸦笑猪黑。
    你们在这次中东事件中，开头满口保证“支持”阿拉伯国家，而当阿拉伯国家遭到美以侵略的时候，你们却胆小如鼠，溜之大吉，把自己的“保证”丢得一干二净，这难道不是背信弃义吗？
    你们在以色列侵入阿拉伯国家之后，不但不支持阿拉伯国家抗击侵略者，反而伙同美帝国主义，迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”，这难道不更是双料的背信弃义吗？
    修正主义者之所以为修正主义者，就是因为他们打着各式各样骗人的招牌，而干的是叛卖革命的卑鄙勾当。他们口头上讲一些漂亮话，都是为了骗人的，根本不是准备实行的。因此，他们总是要自己打自己的嘴巴。言行不一，口是心非，出尔反尔，背信弃义，这正是一切修正主义者的共同点，是他们的反动阶级本性决定的。
    列宁在痛斥叛徒考茨基时曾经指出，第二国际修正主义的政策，是“典型的市侩庸人政策”。
    今天的苏修集团就是一伙典型的市侩。哪里有利，他们就往哪里钻；什么事不利，他们就不干，根本不讲原则。平时他们也可以说几句什么“反帝”呀，什么“支持各国人民斗争”呀，唱一点高调；一到关键时刻，就自食其言，还不以为耻，反以为荣。今天对你作笑脸，明天就翻脸不认人。苏修集团干这种背信弃义的行径早已习以为常，成为家常便饭。世界各国人民已经领教得够多的了。
    在一九六○年刚果（金）事件中，苏修一边说它是“支持”刚果（金）人民的，一边却在联合国同美帝国主义一起举手，赞成派“联合国军”去镇压刚果（金）民族解放运动。
    在一九六二年加勒比海事件中，苏修头一天还发表声明谴责美国，可是第二天它就吓得屁滚尿流，向美国叩头求饶，出卖了古巴人民。
    在越南问题上，苏修发表左一个声明，右一篇讲话，大讲同越南人民的“友谊”，可是一有机会它就大干其叛卖的勾当。
    苏修集团过去是这样干的，今后它一定还是要这样干。它在所谓关于“近东政策”的决议中又冠冕堂皇地说：要给“各国人民以全力支持”。可是，这些字句的墨迹未干，柯西金就同约翰逊开始了葛拉斯堡罗密谈，这难道不是对阿拉伯和全世界人民的又一次背信弃义行动吗？
    由此可见，苏修集团的反革命本性是绝对不会改变的。对于这一伙厚颜无耻的市侩，唯一正确的政策，就是坚决揭露，坚决斗争，坚决打倒。
