	1. On behalf of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court, he notified him that this afternoon at 3 PM, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court held a public trial of the Indian spy Lu Guannan. The defendant Lu Guannan, fearing guilt, did not dare to appear in court. The public trial proceeded in his absence. Over 15,000 revolutionary masses attended the trial, expressing their indignation at Lu Guannan's serious crimes and demanding severe punishment.

	The special people's court of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court, after investigation, found that the defendant Lu Guannan, under the cover of a diplomat, flagrantly violated the laws of the People's Republic of China and engaged in espionage activities on Chinese territory, seriously endangering China's national security and must be punished according to the law. According to the laws of the People's Republic of China, the court sentenced Lu Guannan to expulsion from the country, to be executed immediately. Lu Guannan must strictly follow the designated time and route to leave the country under the escort of our public security personnel and Red Guards. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be his responsibility.

	2. The Third Secretary of the Indian Embassy, Vijay, collaborated with Lu Guannan in espionage activities, stealing Chinese military intelligence, seriously violating Chinese laws, and wantonly violating international relations norms. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China declares Vijay an unwelcome person. He must leave Chinese territory within three days starting from midnight today.
