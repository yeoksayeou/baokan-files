200,000 revolutionary masses in the capital gathered in front of the Burmese Embassy today to hold a massive protest. They strongly condemned the Burmese government's instigation and connivance of mobs in repeatedly attacking our embassy, killing our experts, and persecuting and massacring our compatriots. They expressed their resolute support for the urgent and strongest protest note sent by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Burmese government on June 28, and their fervent support for our government's stern position. They vowed to be a powerful backing for our personnel and compatriots in Burma who are fighting against violence.

The protesting masses carried portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and held copies of the Little Red Book, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and chanting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" They sternly denounced the Burmese government's instigation and connivance of mobs in openly and viciously insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They said, Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of 700 million Chinese people, and the great leader of all revolutionary people in China and the world. The great thought of Mao Zedong is the beacon guiding the world's revolutionary people to victory. The reactionary clique in Burma is afraid of the truth, afraid of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and afraid of the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They collude with U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries to fiercely carry out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, thinking they have succeeded, but in fact, they are only "lifting a rock to drop on their own feet"! Truth cannot be suppressed, and the wings of crows cannot block the sun's rays. The great thought of Mao Zedong is invincible!

Today, in front of the Burmese Embassy, the protesting columns stretched end to end, and the roar of anger shook the heavens and the earth. The walls and the road in front of the Burmese Embassy were covered with layers of big-character posters and slogans denouncing the Burmese reactionaries.

The heroic Red Guards of the capital were indignant and full of fighting spirit, verbally and in writing condemning the Burmese reactionaries. The young revolutionaries of the East Is Red Public Security Committee of Beijing Institute of Machinery, sang the song "Rebellion is Justified" and performed the street play "Smash the Burmese Reactionaries," deeply exposing the ugly face of the Burmese reactionaries' frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

Many revolutionary workers from Beijing Motorcycle Manufacturing Plant, Beijing Low-Voltage Electrical Appliances Factory, and Beijing Experimental Equipment Factory could not hold back their anger and rushed to the Burmese Embassy to protest during their usual lunch break. They said, the working class of the capital and the people of the whole country are closely watching the next move of the Burmese government and the development of the situation. We must warn the Burmese reactionary government: 700 million Chinese people are not to be insulted! 700 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with! Those who make enemies of 700 million Chinese people will not have a good ending!

The revolutionary masses from the unit where the Chinese expert Liu Yi, who was killed by the Burmese reactionaries, worked—the Water Resources and Electric Power Department's Water Conservancy and Hydropower Construction Bureau—carried Liu Yi's portrait and, with hearts full of indignation, handed a protest letter to the Burmese Ambassador Sin Wannau. The protest letter said, you have frenziedly carried out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, openly killing the expert helping Burma, our comrade Liu Yi, which is an unforgivable heinous crime. This exposes your fascist reactionary face to the world. Blood debts must be repaid! The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not let you, this small clique of reactionaries, off. The protest leaflet distributed by the revolutionary masses of the Foreign Economic Liaison Commission of the People's Republic of China said, the 700 million Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong have always given selfless aid and strong support to the Burmese people's struggle against imperialism, against colonialism, to maintain national independence, and to develop the national economy. However, the Burmese reactionary government, disregarding the interests of the Burmese people, has committed insane acts, insulting our great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly attacking our embassy, and killing our compatriots and experts. This has actually seriously violated the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma, and all the serious consequences arising from this must be fully borne by the Burmese government.

The Chinese staff of the Burmese Embassy, at 10 a.m. today, lined up at the gate to sing "The Ship Sails on with the Helmsman at the Rudder" and songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations, and shouted slogans protesting the Burmese government's despicable anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. They also read a stern protest letter to the Burmese Ambassador Sin Wannau.

Many overseas Chinese and students who had returned from Burma strongly condemned the Burmese reactionaries' heinous crimes. Some foreign experts and international friends working in Beijing also participated in the capital's revolutionary masses' protest march.

    首都二十万革命群众到缅甸大使馆前大示威
    最强烈抗议缅甸政府反华排华暴行
    最坚决拥护我国政府严正立场，誓作侨胞抗暴的后盾
    据新华社二十九日讯　首都二十万革命群众，今天到缅甸驻华使馆门前，举行声势浩大的示威，最强烈地抗议缅甸政府唆使和纵容暴徒连续袭击我使馆，杀害我专家，迫害、屠杀我侨胞的滔天罪行。他们表示最坚决地支持我国外交部二十八日向缅甸政府提出的最紧急最强烈的抗议照会，最热烈地拥护我国政府的严正立场，誓作坚持抗暴斗争的我驻缅人员和侨胞的强大后盾。
    抗议示威的革命群众，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱毛主席语录歌，高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们严正声讨缅甸政府指使和纵容暴徒公然恶毒地侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。他们说，毛主席是七亿中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳，是全中国和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。伟大的毛泽东思想是引导世界革命人民走向胜利的灯塔。缅甸一小撮反动派害怕真理，害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，害怕毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，配合美帝、苏修和各国反动派，大肆反华排华，自以为得计，其实只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”！真理是封锁不住的，乌鸦的翅膀遮不住太阳的光辉，伟大的毛泽东思想无往而不胜！
    今天，在缅甸驻华使馆前，一支支抗议示威的队伍首尾相接，怒吼声震天动地。缅甸使馆外面墙上和前面马路，贴满了密密层层的声讨缅甸反动派的大字报和大字标语。
    英雄的首都红卫兵，群情激愤，斗志昂扬，口诛笔伐缅甸反动派。北京机械学院东方红公社毛泽东思想宣传队的小将们，高唱《造反有理》歌曲，表演《砸烂缅甸反动派》的活报剧，深刻地揭露了缅甸反动派疯狂反华排华的丑态。
    北京市摩托车制造厂、北京低压电器厂、北京试验设备厂等单位的许多革命职工，按捺不住满腔的怒火，抓紧通常中午休息时间，赶到缅甸使馆抗议示威。他们说，首都工人阶级和全国人民一样，正在密切注视着缅甸政府的下一步行动和事态的发展。必须警告缅甸反动政府：七亿中国人民是不可侮的！七亿中国人民是不好惹的！同七亿中国人民为敌决没有好下场！
    缅甸反动派杀害的中国专家刘逸所在单位——水利电力部水利水电建设总局的革命群众，抬着刘逸烈士的遗像，怀着万分愤怒的心情，向缅甸驻华大使信瓦瑙递交了抗议书。抗议书说，你们疯狂地反华排华，公然杀害援缅专家、我局的革命战士刘逸同志，这是不可饶恕的滔天罪行。这在全世界面前暴露了你们的法西斯反动面目。血债必须偿还！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民决不会放过你们这一小撮反动派。中华人民共和国对外经济联络委员会革命群众散发的抗议传单说，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，对于缅甸人民反帝、反殖、维护民族独立、发展民族经济的斗争，一向给予无私的援助和大力的支持。但是，置缅甸人民利益于不顾的缅甸反动政府，竟然干出了丧心病狂的勾当，侮辱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，连续袭击我使馆，杀害我侨胞和专家。这实际上已经极端严重地破坏了中缅两国经济技术合作协定，由此产生的一切严重后果，必须由缅甸政府完全承担。
    缅甸驻华使馆的中国工作人员，今天上午十时，在使馆门口列队高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌，齐声朗读毛主席语录，高呼抗议缅甸政府反华排华卑劣行径的口号，并且向缅甸大使信瓦瑙当面宣读了义正词严的抗议书。
    许多从缅甸归国的华侨和留学生，最坚决地谴责缅甸反动派的滔天罪行。一些在京工作的外国专家和国际友人，今天也参加了首都革命群众的示威行列。
