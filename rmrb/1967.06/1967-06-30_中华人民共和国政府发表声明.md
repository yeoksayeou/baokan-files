The Government of the People's Republic of China Issues a Statement

The Strongest and Most Serious Protest Against the Fascist Atrocities of Anti-Chinese and Exclusionary Policies by the Burmese Government

In light of the Burmese government's actions to cater to the needs of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, pushing Sino-Burmese relations to an unprecedentedly deteriorating state, the Chinese government has decided not to send back the Chinese ambassador to Burma and will take other necessary measures based on the development of the situation. If the Burmese government, disregarding the strong desire of the Burmese people to be friends with the Chinese people, insists on its course of action and pushes to the extreme, the result will only be that it will lift a stone to drop on its own feet.

New China News Agency, June 29th - The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the 29th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China

June 29, 1967

The Burmese government, despite repeated serious protests from the Chinese government, has escalated its anti-Chinese and exclusionary policies. It continues to organize and condone mobs attacking the Chinese Embassy in Burma and other Chinese representative institutions, killing and injuring Chinese experts and diplomatic personnel assisting Burma, and massacring a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese, committing rare fascist atrocities in the history of international relations, pushing Sino-Burmese relations to an unprecedentedly deteriorating state.

Following the large-scale anti-Chinese and exclusionary incidents on June 26th and 27th, on the 28th at noon and in the afternoon, several thousand mobs twice stormed the Chinese Embassy, wielding knives and causing extensive damage. Chinese expert Liu Yi was brutally killed on the spot. Several Chinese diplomatic personnel were also stabbed and injured. At the same time, thousands of mobs also attacked the Military Attaché's Office, Consular Section, Economic Counselor's Office, Xinhua Branch, and the China Civil Aviation Administration Office of the Chinese Embassy, beating people, setting fires, and causing chaos. On June 29th, the Burmese military also sealed off the Chinese Embassy, prohibiting embassy personnel from leaving.

In recent days, the atrocities of killing, arresting, and looting overseas Chinese by Burmese mobs have reached a frenzied level. When they attacked and burned down the United Committee of Overseas Chinese Teachers, they brutally beat to death nearly thirty overseas Chinese teachers and students. In Rangoon, overseas Chinese residences, associations, and shops were attacked everywhere, overseas Chinese were brutally killed, injured, and arrested, and the number is innumerable. Currently, Rangoon is under fascist white terror.

The above-mentioned unprecedentedly serious anti-Chinese and exclusionary atrocities were orchestrated by the Burmese government. The Burmese government, due to its long-term implementation of reactionary policies against communism and the people, is in great difficulty and having a hard time. It orchestrated this series of horrifying anti-Chinese and exclusionary atrocities to cater to the needs of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, attempting to divert the strong dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the Burmese people towards it. This conspiracy is doomed to fail.

Regarding the Burmese government's anti-Chinese and exclusionary atrocities, the Chinese side has repeatedly lodged strong protests with the Burmese government. On June 28th, the Chinese Embassy in Burma, Deputy Chief of Mission Xiao Ming, also presented five stern demands to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Executive Secretary U Ohn Kyi: 1. Severely punish the culprits, 2. Compensate the families of the victims, 3. Publicly apologize, 4. Guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy in Burma and other institutions and all Chinese personnel, 5. Immediately stop the fascist atrocities against overseas Chinese.

The Chinese government sternly points out that the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Burma cultivated over many years is not to be destroyed. The Chinese government and people absolutely cannot tolerate the Burmese government's series of fascist atrocities. The Chinese government once again lodges the strongest and most serious protest against the Burmese government. In view of the Burmese government having deteriorated the relations between the two countries to such a serious extent, the Chinese government has decided not to send back the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Burma and will take other necessary measures based on the possible development of the situation.

The Burmese government must stop at the brink and immediately stop all anti-Chinese and exclusionary atrocities, and immediately implement the stern demands of the Chinese side. If the Burmese government, disregarding the strong desire of the 25 million Burmese people to be friends with the Chinese people, insists on its course of action and pushes to the extreme, it can be asserted that the result will only be that it will lift a stone to drop on its own feet, and it will definitely not bring any benefits to it.

    中华人民共和国政府发表声明
    最强烈最严重抗议缅甸政府反华排华的法西斯暴行
    鉴于缅甸政府迎合美帝和苏修的需要，把中缅关系推到了空前恶化的地步，中国政府决定不再派回驻缅大使，并将根据情况的发展采取其他必要措施。如果缅甸政府不顾缅甸人民要同中国人民友好的强烈愿望，一意孤行，蛮干到底，其结果只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚
    新华社二十九日讯　中华人民共和国政府二十九日发表声明，声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                    一九六七年六月二十九日
    缅甸政府不顾中国政府的一再严重抗议，变本加厉地推行反华排华政策，继续组织和纵容暴徒袭击中国驻缅甸大使馆和中国其他代表机构，打死打伤我援缅专家和外交人员，屠杀大批爱国华侨，制造了国际关系史上少见的法西斯暴行，把中缅两国关系推到了空前恶化的地步。
    继六月二十六日和二十七日的大规模反华排华事件之后，二十八日中午和下午，又有数千名暴徒两次冲进中国大使馆，持刀行凶，大肆破坏。中国援缅专家刘逸同志惨遭刺杀，当场壮烈牺牲。中国外交人员多名被刺负伤。与此同时，成千暴徒还分头袭击中国大使馆的武官处、领事部、经济参赞处、新华分社和中国民航总局办事处等机构，打人放火，胡作非为。六月二十九日，缅甸军队并封锁了中国大使馆，禁止使馆人员外出。
    几天以来，缅甸暴徒残杀、逮捕和洗劫华侨的暴行也达到疯狂的程度。他们在袭击和焚烧华侨教师联合委员会时，就活活打死华侨教师和学生近三十人。在仰光，华侨住宅、侨团、商店到处被袭击，华侨惨遭杀害，打伤和逮捕者不计其数，整个仰光目前正处在法西斯白色恐怖中。
    上述空前严重的反华排华暴行，是缅甸政府一手策划的。缅甸政府由于长期执行反共反人民的反动政策，困难重重，日子很不好过。它迎合美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的需要，策划这一连串骇人听闻的反华排华暴行，妄图转移缅甸广大人民对它的强烈不满。这种阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。
    对于缅甸政府的反华排华暴行，中国方面已经多次向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议。六月二十八日，中国驻缅甸大使馆肖明代办并且当面向缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦提出五项严正要求：一、严惩凶手，二、抚恤受难家属，三、公开道歉，四、保证中国驻缅甸大使馆和其他机构及全体中国人员的安全，五、立即停止对华侨的法西斯暴行。
    中国政府严正指出，中缅两国人民多年来共同培植的深厚友谊是不容破坏的。对缅甸政府上述一系列的法西斯暴行，中国政府和中国人民绝对不能容忍。中国政府向缅甸政府再次提出最强烈、最严重的抗议。鉴于缅甸政府已经把两国关系恶化到如此严重地步，中国政府决定不再派回中华人民共和国驻缅甸大使，并将根据情况的可能发展采取其他必要的措施。
    缅甸政府必须悬崖勒马，立即停止一切反华排华暴行，立即实现中国方面的严正要求。如果缅甸政府不顾两千五百万缅甸人民要同中国人民友好的强烈愿望，一意孤行，蛮干到底，那么，可以断言，其结果只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，而绝不会为它带来任何好处。
