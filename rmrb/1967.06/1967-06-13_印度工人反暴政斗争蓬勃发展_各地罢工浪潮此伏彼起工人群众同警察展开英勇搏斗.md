The struggle of the Indian working class against oppression and for survival has surged in the past half month, rapidly expanding.

In Hyderabad, 16,000 road transport workers began an indefinite strike on May 24, demanding a wage increase. The strike by transport workers was suppressed by the Indian reactionary government, and the workers bravely fought back against the police. The police attacked the workers with iron truncheons and even tear gas. The workers retaliated with stones. This major strike paralyzed public bus transportation in 12 out of 20 districts in Andhra Pradesh.

Thousands of road transport workers in Hyderabad went on strike on May 30, continuing to demand a wage increase. The Congress Party government's police opened fire on the striking workers, injuring over a hundred people, and created a bloody scene of repression against the workers.

In Jabalpur, Central Province, workers went on a general strike on May 26 to protest hunger and demand increased rations. The police opened fire on the workers. The workers fought back with stones and police, injuring many police officers and burning down a cooperative bank. The reactionary authorities, frightened by the workers' resolute struggle, deployed large numbers of troops for "defense," imposed a 24-hour curfew on the entire city, and carried out mass arrests.

In Bombay, nearly 2,000 workers at India's largest fertilizer factory went on strike on May 17, demanding a wage increase and allowances. Eight hundred salt workers in the city went on strike on May 16. The police opened fire, injuring two workers. The workers fought back resolutely, injuring eleven police officers.

In Bihar, workers at a British-run cable company staged a tenacious 16-day strike and, on May 21, won their struggle, forcing the capitalists to rescind their decision to fire 151 workers.

Near Sambalpur in Orissa, workers at a paper mill fought back against the police opening fire and killing workers during their strike, killing one police officer.

Workers at a factory in Barddhaman began an indefinite strike on May 24 to protest the capitalist's firing of workers.

In Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, workers at an American construction company went on strike on May 17, strongly protesting the savage beating of the union secretary by American capitalists. Three thousand workers angrily surrounded the American manager's residence and threw stones at his windows. The American capitulated and apologized to the union secretary, ending the strike in victory.

Workers and citizens of Calcutta have increasingly resisted the reactionary policies of the Congress Party government. On May 28, people in two areas of the city fought a large-scale battle with the police against the government's intensified reactionary policies in the area.

Workers and citizens of Ahmedabad took to the streets on May 22 to protest the Congress Party's reactionary policies, setting fire to several government and Congress Party offices. The Indian reactionary government deployed police to suppress the masses, firing nearly 400 tear gas canisters and arresting nearly 200 people in a brutal repression. Workers and citizens fought back resolutely, injuring over 70 police officers.
