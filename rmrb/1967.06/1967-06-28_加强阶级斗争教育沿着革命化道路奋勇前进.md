The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth Union was held in a warm and solemn atmosphere at the "Partisan" Sports Hall in Tirana on the morning of June 26.

The great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, and other party and state leaders such as Shehu and List were present at the opening ceremony. When Hoxha and the other leaders entered the venue, all the delegates stood up and cheered enthusiastically for a long time, shouting "Enver Hoxha!" and "Labor Party!"

Over 1,800 delegates from all fronts across Albania gathered at the "Partisan" Sports Hall to review the great victories achieved by Albanian youth in the socialist revolution and socialist construction since the Fourth Congress of the Labor Youth Union, and to accept new combat tasks assigned to the youth by the Albanian Labor Party. The delegates were full of fighting spirit and vigor, singing revolutionary songs such as "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun" and shouting slogans like "Labor Party, we are always ready!" They expressed their determination not to disappoint the Labor Party's sincere hopes and care for the youth and to advance boldly along the road of revolutionization as indicated by the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha.

The Chinese Red Guards delegation, invited to attend this congress, entered the venue before the opening of the congress. Today, the young Red Guards were full of spirit, dressed in green uniforms, wearing shiny Mao badges on their chests, and holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They enthusiastically waved to their Albanian comrades. At this moment, all the delegates stood up and cheered enthusiastically for Mao's Little Red Guards, the vanguard of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The slogans "Enver-Mao Tse-tung!" "People's China!" and "Friendship is the guarantee!" echoed throughout the hall.

After the opening of the congress, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth Union, Mero, delivered the opening speech. When he introduced the Chinese Red Guards delegation led by Comrade Yao Wen-yuan in his opening speech, all the delegates stood up again and cheered enthusiastically, "Enver-Mao Tse-tung!" "People's China!"

Delegations from 23 youth organizations from five continents were also invited to attend this congress.

Comrade Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, spoke at the congress, conveying the warm congratulations of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Hoxha to the congress. Comrade Shehu's speech (to be published separately) repeatedly received thunderous applause and cheers from the entire audience. When Shehu spoke about the great historical significance and brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, as well as the great achievements of China's successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb, the entire audience stood up multiple times, cheering enthusiastically, "Enver-Mao Tse-tung!" "Long live Comrade Mao Tse-tung!"

Mero reported on the first item of the agenda, "On the Activities of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth Union and the Implementation of the Decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party on Revolutionary Education for the Younger Generation."

The report first discussed the achievements made by the Albanian Labor Youth Union and the revolutionary youth together with the broad masses of laboring people across the country under the guidance of the decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha's speech on February 6. The report said that the youth's pulse is beating strongly everywhere in the motherland. To implement the instructions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party, the youth have launched daring activities on new fronts.

When discussing the current international situation, the report pointed out that the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Khrushchev revisionists, have particularly targeted the People's Republic of China. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Tse-tung, has made the American imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists jump with rage.

Mero said, "We, on the platform of our congress, salute the glorious brotherly Chinese youth and the revolutionary Red Guards. They are the vanguard of the cultural revolution and play a great role in defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist destiny of the People's Republic of China. Our youth are happy about the great victories achieved by the brotherly Chinese people and youth in various aspects of socialist construction. Albanian youth are particularly excited to congratulate the People's Republic of China on the successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb, which further shatters the nuclear monopoly of American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, making another contribution to the defense of world peace and security, and giving new encouragement to the progressive people and youth of all countries in the world who are fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries."

The report said that in view of the current domestic and international conditions, the basic task of the Labor Youth Union is to conduct political and ideological education for the youth and to temper the youth with revolutionary class spirit. Experience has shown that the danger of the degeneration and restoration of capitalist rule under the dictatorship of the proletariat comes not only from external aggression but also from the corruption and infiltration of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. One must never forget that class struggle is always sharp throughout the entire period of transition from capitalism to communism. Failure to recognize this fact will lead to fatal errors. Therefore, the party teaches us not to forget class struggle and to wage this struggle in all fields to advance the revolution. The Albanian Labor Youth Union should correctly understand class struggle in its political and ideological education work, educate the youth with the class spirit of the proletariat, and teach them to judge everything with a class perspective and to observe everything in work and life with a political perspective.

The report then detailed the issues of conducting Marxist-Leninist theoretical education for the youth; letting the youth participate in the actual revolutionary struggles against religious superstition, backward customs, narrow personal interests, petty-bourgeois private property ideas, and for the complete liberation of women; tempering and testing the youth in class struggle; strengthening the youth's physical training and military training; and letting the youth participate more actively and widely in socialist construction and the further revolutionization of the Labor Youth Union organization.

The report strongly condemned the Khrushchev revisionists for vigorously promoting the policy of splitting and pro-imperialism in the international youth movement, destroying the unity and anti-imperialist struggle of progressive youth and students around the world. The report pointed out that to successfully wage the struggle against imperialism, one must also wage a struggle against all kinds of reformism and opportunism that serve imperialism. The revisionist leaders of the Soviet Komsomol are trying to make the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students serve their traitorous policies, playing the role of enemies and splitters in the anti-imperialist movement of youth and students, and performing a role that American imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, and youth organizations of social democratic parties cannot perform.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟举行第五次代表大会
    加强阶级斗争教育沿着革命化道路奋勇前进
    霍查同志等领导人出席　谢胡同志代表劳动党中央和霍查同志热烈祝贺我红卫兵代表团出席大会受到阿尔巴尼亚战友热烈欢迎
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会，二十六日上午在地拉那“游击队”体育馆热烈隆重开幕。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查以及党和国家的其他领导人谢胡、列希等出席了开幕式。当霍查同志和其他领导同志进入会场时，全体代表起立，长时间地热烈欢呼“恩维尔·霍查！”“劳动党！”
    来自阿尔巴尼亚全国各个战线上的一千八百名代表在“游击队”体育馆欢聚一堂，总结自劳动青年联盟第四次代表大会以来，阿尔巴尼亚青年在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的伟大胜利，接受阿尔巴尼亚劳动党交给青年的新的战斗任务。全体代表斗志昂扬，意气风发，高唱《一手拿镐，一手拿枪》等革命歌曲，高呼“劳动党，我们时刻准备着”等战斗口号，表示决不辜负阿尔巴尼亚劳动党对青年的殷切希望和关怀，决心沿着阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大和霍查同志所指引的革命化道路奋勇前进。
    应邀参加这次代表大会的中国红卫兵代表团在大会开始前进入会场。今天，红卫兵小将们精神焕发，穿着草绿色的服装，胸前佩带着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手中高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情地向阿尔巴尼亚战友挥手致意。这时，全体代表起立，向毛主席的红小兵、中国无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋热烈欢呼。“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”“友谊就是保证！”等口号声响彻全场。
    大会开始后，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央第一书记梅罗致开幕词。当他在开幕词中介绍到出席代表大会的由姚文元同志率领的中国红卫兵代表团时，全体代表再次起立热烈欢呼“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”
    应邀参加这次代表大会的还有来自五大洲的二十三个青年组织的代表团。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡在大会上讲了话，代表党中央和霍查同志向大会热烈祝贺。谢胡同志的讲话（另发）不断博得全场暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。当谢胡谈到毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义和取得的光辉胜利以及中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的巨大成就时，全场多次起立，热烈鼓掌，振臂欢呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“毛泽东同志万岁！”
    梅罗就大会的第一项议程，在会上作了“关于阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央的活动和执行劳动党五大关于对青年一代进行革命教育的决议”的报告。
    报告首先谈到，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟和广大革命青年，同全国广大劳动人民一起，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大决议和霍查同志二月六日讲话照耀下所取得的成就。报告说，在祖国各地到处都可以感受到青年的脉搏在有力地跳动。为了实现劳动党五大的指示，青年在新的战线上开展了勇敢的活动。
    报告在谈到当前的国际形势时指出，美帝国主义者及其走狗赫鲁晓夫修正主义者特别把矛头指向了中华人民共和国。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志所领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展，使美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者暴跳如雷。
    梅罗说，我们，在我们代表大会的讲台上，向光荣的兄弟中国青年致敬，向革命的红卫兵致敬，他们是文化大革命的先锋，他们在保卫中华人民共和国的无产阶级专政和社会主义命运的斗争中起着巨大的作用。我国青年为兄弟中国人民和青年在社会主义建设各方面取得的伟大胜利感到高兴。阿尔巴尼亚青年特别兴奋地祝贺中华人民共和国爆炸了第一颗氢弹，它进一步粉碎了美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的核垄断，对保卫世界和平与安全作出了又一贡献，并给予正在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派的世界各国进步人民和青年以新的鼓舞。
    报告在谈到劳动青年联盟今后面临的巨大任务时说，鉴于当前的国内和国际条件，对青年进行政治思想教育并用革命的阶级精神锻炼青年，是劳动青年联盟的基本任务。经验表明，无产阶级专政的蜕化变质和资本主义复辟的危险不仅来自外部的侵略，而且还来自资产阶级和修正主义的腐蚀和侵袭。千万不可忘记，在从资本主义过渡到共产主义的整个时期内，阶级斗争始终是尖锐的。不认识这一事实，就会犯致命的错误。为此党教导我们，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，应该在各个领域内不断开展这场斗争，以推进革命。阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟在其政治思想教育工作中应该正确理解阶级斗争，以无产阶级的阶级精神教育青年，教会他们时时用阶级观点来判断一切问题，用政治观点来观察工作和生活中的一切现象。
    报告接着详细谈到对青年进行马克思列宁主义理论教育；让青年参加反对宗教迷信、落后习俗、狭隘的个人利益和小资产阶级的私有制观念以及争取彻底解放妇女的实际革命斗争；在阶级斗争中使青年经受锻炼和考验；加强青年的体育锻炼和军事训练；让青年更加积极广泛地参加社会主义建设和实现劳动青年联盟组织的进一步革命化的措施等问题。
    报告在最后强烈谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在国际青年运动中大力推行分裂和亲帝路线，破坏世界进步青年和学生的团结和反帝斗争。报告指出，为了胜利地进行反对帝国主义的斗争，必须同时和为帝国主义效劳的形形色色的改良主义和机会主义进行斗争。苏联共青团的修正主义领导人竭力使世界民主青年联盟和国际学联为他们的叛徒政策效劳，在青年和学生的反帝运动中扮演着敌对和分裂者的角色，起着美帝国主义者、各国反动派和社会民主党青年组织都不能起到的作用。
