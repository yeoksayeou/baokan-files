The three revolutionary mass organizations in Shandong—Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, Shandong Red Guards Command, and Shandong Revolutionary Arts Rebel Command—have been holding study sessions and discussions in recent days. They have been carefully studying the "Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Styles" issued by the Shandong Revolutionary Committee and the editorial article "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Thought" from the journal *Red Flag*. They have decided to take immediate action to resolutely implement the regulations of the provincial revolutionary committee.

During the study process, they deeply felt that to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois thought, and prevent peaceful evolution, it is necessary to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. In ideology, work style, and life, they must achieve revolutionization, always appear in the posture of laborers, resolutely oppose special privileges, and resolutely oppose all styles that alienate them from the masses. The three revolutionary mass organizations in Shandong also studied the series of revolutionary measures taken swiftly by the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee in response to the "Regulations" issued by the Shandong Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai, to implement the "Regulations" without any compromise, and to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

After the study, the leader of the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters immediately drafted specific opinions and thirteen revolutionary measures for implementing the "Regulations," transforming work styles, closely connecting with the masses, and preventing the infiltration of bourgeois thought. They required all subordinate revolutionary organizations and the broad revolutionary masses to supervise the leading organs in implementing the regulations. The leader of this headquarters said, "This 'Regulation' is not a trivial matter of life, but a major measure to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois thought. In fact, in our organization, some leading comrades have already shown signs of arrogance and self-satisfaction, beginning to act like officials, connecting less with the masses, participating less in labor, only wanting praise and not willing to accept criticism, forgetting the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and the 'big boss' style has begun to grow. This 'Regulation' and the editorial article from *Red Flag* have sounded the alarm for us. We must definitely, according to the spirit of this document, examine and correct our thoughts and work. Whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely correct it. We must streamline the organization, 'reduce bureaucracy,' transform work styles, go deep among the masses, insist on working two and a half days a week, gradually transition to half a day of work and half a day of labor, forever maintain the character of ordinary laborers, resolutely eliminate special privileges, and forever implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carrying the Cultural Revolution to the end."

The leader of the Shandong Red Guards Command said, "The ten measures proposed in this 'Regulation' not only point out the direction for the revolutionization of leading organs but also timely sound the alarm for us revolutionary youth to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois thought. We firmly support and resolutely implement it. We must combine the study of this document with the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, and with our current rectification movement. We are determined to make new contributions in the new situation and push the Cultural Revolution to a new stage."

The representatives of the Shandong Revolutionary Arts Rebel Command unanimously pointed out: "In the current situation where the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads is deepening, the 'Regulation' has proposed major measures to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and prevent the infiltration of bourgeois thought. These measures are of great practical significance, especially for us revolutionary cultural workers. Since the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary cultural workers have been tempered in the stormy class struggle, but there are still various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in our minds to different degrees. We still have a heavy task of ideological transformation. We must repeatedly study, seriously implement, and resolutely execute this 'Regulation.' We must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly transform our worldview in the process of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and temper ourselves into true successors of the proletarian revolutionary cultural cause."

    牢记毛主席教导，永远保持艰苦奋斗作风
    山东三大革命群众组织认真学习省革委会《规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章，决心密切联系群众，作人民的忠实勤务员
    据新华社济南二十七日电　山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部三大革命群众组织，连日来组织座谈会、学习会，认真学习《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》，决定立即行动起来，坚决贯彻执行省革命委员会的规定。
    在学习过程中，他们深深地体会到，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，防止和平演变，必须树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，在思想上、作风上、生活上实现革命化，处处以劳动者的姿态出现，坚决反对特殊化，坚决反对一切脱离群众的作风。山东省三大革命群众组织还学习了上海市革命委员会就山东省革命委员会《规定》的发表，雷厉风行地采取的一系列革命化措施。决心学习上海市无产阶级革命派雷厉风行的革命精神，不折不扣地执行《规定》，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    山东革命工人造反总指挥部负责人在学习后，立即拟出贯彻执行《规定》的具体意见和十三条转变作风、密切联系群众、防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的革命措施，要求所属革命组织和广大革命群众监督领导机关贯彻执行。这个指挥部的负责人说，这个《规定》，不是生活小事，而是防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的重大措施。事实上，在我们组织中，有的领导同志的骄傲自满和以功臣自居的情绪已经出现，开始有了“官气”，联系群众少了，参加劳动少了，光愿听表扬，不愿听批评，忘记了艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，大手大脚的“大少爷”作风有所滋长。这个《规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章给我们敲起了警钟。我们一定根据这个文件的精神，对照检查我们的思想和工作，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决改正。我们一定要紧缩编制，“精兵简政”，转变作风，深入群众，坚持每周劳动两个半天，逐步过渡到半日工作、半日劳动，永远保持普通劳动者的本色，坚决打掉特殊化，永远执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    红卫兵山东指挥部的负责人说，这个《规定》提出的十条措施，不仅为领导机关的革命化指出了方向，也向我们革命青年及时地敲响了防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的警钟，我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。我们一定要把学习这个文件与活学活用毛主席著作结合起来，与我们当前的整风运动结合起来，决心在新的形势下，不断地做出新的贡献，把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的阶段。
    红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部的代表们一致指出：当前在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争向纵深发展的情况下，《规定》提出了树立毛泽东思想绝对权威，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的重大措施。这些措施对所有无产阶级革命派战士，特别对我们革命的文艺工作者更有着重要的现实意义。自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，革命文艺工作者在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中受到了很大锻炼，但是我们的思想上还不同程度地存在着形形色色的资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想，我们自己还有着艰巨的思想改造任务。我们要反复学习，认真落实，坚决执行这个《规定》。我们要活学活用毛主席著作，在为工农兵服务的过程中，不断地改造自己的世界观，把自己锻炼成一个真正的无产阶级革命文艺事业的接班人。
