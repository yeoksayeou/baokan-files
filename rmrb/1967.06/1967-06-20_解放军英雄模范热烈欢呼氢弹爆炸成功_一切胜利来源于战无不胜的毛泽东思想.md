The news of the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb has greatly inspired the People's Liberation Army's active elements in studying Chairman Mao's works, war heroes, and the officers and soldiers of advanced units. They, with hearts filled with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration, enthusiastically hailed this as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

War hero Mai Xiande, who is recuperating in a certain place, jumped out of bed in the middle of the night upon hearing this exhilarating news. He shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" He said, Vice Chairman Lin Biao has taught us, "By spreading Chairman Mao's thoughts among workers and peasants, we can change the spiritual outlook of the working people and transform spiritual strength into tremendous material strength." The successful explosion of the hydrogen bomb has once again convincingly proven that people armed with the boundless Mao Zedong Thought are invincible, can overcome any difficulties, and can achieve any miracles.

The officers and soldiers of the platoon and company where Lei Feng and Liu Yingjun served before their deaths said, with such a powerful spiritual atomic bomb as Mao Zedong Thought, we can produce atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs in the shortest time. What imperialism, modern revisionism, nuclear powers, and superpowers—none of them are a match for us. The successful explosion of the hydrogen bomb is a heavy blow to the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Their dream of nuclear monopoly has completely shattered.

Heroes and models from various units and active elements in studying Chairman Mao's works unanimously praised that Mao Zedong Thought is the golden key to opening the treasure house of human wisdom. Wherever it is applied, there will be victory. Active elements in studying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, Feng Fusheng and Huang Zushi, excitedly said, "Who has the highest prestige in the world? Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has the highest prestige. What has the greatest power in the world? Mao Zedong Thought has the greatest power." In June 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "To make some atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is completely possible in ten years." Nine years later, today, Chairman Mao's wise prediction and great call have become a living reality.

The officers and soldiers of a certain air force unit who shot down six U.S. aggressor planes in the sky over a certain place in Guangxi from April 24 to June 12, the officers and soldiers of the "Sea Tigers" that roared in the East China Sea, and the platoon leader He Laifu of a certain unit who was awarded a second-class merit in the self-defense counterattack war on the Sino-Indian border, all warmly congratulated this great victory upon hearing the news of the successful hydrogen bomb test. They said, we are the People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao and personally led by Vice Chairman Lin. All our victories come from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The successful hydrogen bomb test has once again proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for achieving all victories. Former first-class hero and special-grade merit holder of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Guo Enzhi, and second-class hero and special-grade merit holder Yi Caixue, upon hearing the great news of the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb, enthusiastically hailed the boundless Mao Zedong Thought! They pointed out that only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have great wisdom and courage, fearing neither hardship nor death. In the past, we relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who were armed to the teeth, on the Korean battlefield, making them suffer a crushing defeat. Today, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to produce atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs. The heroes of various units unanimously expressed that we must never forget to emphasize politics and must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seize the revolution, promote preparedness, work, and production, and create new merits for further enhancing our national defense power, defending our motherland, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    解放军英雄模范热烈欢呼氢弹爆炸成功
    一切胜利来源于战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    据新华社十九日讯　我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的胜利喜讯极大地鼓舞了中国人民解放军的学习毛主席著作积极分子、战斗英雄和先进集体的指战员们，他们以无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，激动地欢呼这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    正在某地疗养的战斗英雄麦贤得，深夜听到这个振奋人心的特大喜讯，激动地从床上一跃而起，连连欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他说，林彪副主席教导我们“把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”这次氢弹爆炸成功，又一次雄辩地证明：用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的人，无高不可攀，无坚不可摧，无往而不胜，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。雷锋、刘英俊生前所在班和连队的干部战士们说，有了毛泽东思想这样威力无穷的精神原子弹，我们就可以在最短的时间里造出原子弹、导弹、氢弹，什么帝国主义、现代修正主义，什么核大王、超级大国，通通不在话下。这次氢弹爆炸成功，是对美帝苏修这两个核霸王实行核垄断和核讹诈的沉重打击，它们垄断核武器的美梦彻底破产了。
    各个部队的英雄模范和学习毛主席著作积极分子一致赞扬，毛泽东思想是打开人类智慧宝库的金钥匙，用到哪里，哪里就胜利。全军学习毛主席著作积极分子丰福生、黄祖示激动地说，世界上什么人威信最高，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席威信最高；世界上什么威力最大，毛泽东思想的威力最大。一九五八年六月我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：
  “搞一点原子弹、氢弹，我看有十年功夫完全可能。”九年后的今天，毛主席的这个英明的预言和伟大号召变成了活生生的现实。
    四月二十四日到六月十二日在广西某地上空接连击落六架美国强盗飞机的空军某部指战员，扬威东海的“海上猛虎艇”的指战员，和在中印边境自卫反击战中荣立二等功的某部连长何来法等，听到氢弹试验成功的大喜讯后，都热烈祝贺这一伟大胜利。他们说，我们是毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席亲自领导的中国人民解放军，我军的一切胜利都是来源于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这次氢弹试验成功又一次证明毛泽东思想是取得一切胜利的根本保证。前中国人民志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣郭恩志，二级英雄、特等功臣易才学，在听到我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的大喜讯以后，热烈欢呼光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！他们指出，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人才能有大智大勇，不怕苦、不怕死。过去我们在朝鲜战场上，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把武装到牙齿的美帝国主义侵略军打得落花流水。今天，我们靠毛泽东思想又造出了原子弹、导弹和氢弹。各部队的战斗英雄们一致表示，我们一定要念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，坚定地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产，为进一步增强我国国防威力，保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，建立新的功勋。
