The Belgian Communist Party's Political Bureau issued a statement on June 7 saying: "The nature of the revisionist traitors who usurped the Soviet power has been exposed once again. They have been and are now colluding with American fascist imperialism, taking consistent actions against the Palestinian people and the people of the Arab countries."

The statement pointed out that the United Nations, under the joint manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, is playing tricks with the "ceasefire" plot, "once again encouraging and aiding imperialist aggression."

The chairman of the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Banmoto Tokumatsu, issued a statement on June 7 pointing out that while the Arab states are launching a storm against U.S. imperialist aggression, the Soviet revisionists, in collusion with the United States, voted in the UN Security Council to pass the "ceasefire resolution." This is another serious act of betrayal. It proves that they are colluding with the U.S. empire, completely trampling on the legitimate demands of the Arab people.

The English weekly "Red Flag" of the Ceylon Communist Party published an editorial on June 7 pointing out that Israel is a dagger inserted by Anglo-American imperialism into the heart of the Arab countries. It acts as an agent and tool of imperialism, serving the interests of imperialism.

The editorial said that the Soviet revisionists play a shameful role in the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism and Israel, betraying the Arab people. On the one hand, they verbally support the Arab cause, but in action, they secretly betray the Arab countries.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station published a commentary on June 7 saying that where there is aggression, there must be resistance. The Arab people's struggle against aggression is a just struggle and has the full support of the people of all countries in the world.

The commentary said that despite the U.S. imperialists colluding with British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, trying to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle, their attempts and efforts will never succeed.

The French Communist Youth Alliance (Marxist-Leninist) organ "Red Guards" recently published a special issue, angrily denouncing the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with American aggressors and betrayal of the interests of the people of the Arab countries. This monthly publication pointed out that the Soviet revisionists' actions are "stabbing the Arab people in the back," "letting the Americans do as they please."

It said: "The Soviet revisionists are actively working to extinguish the resistance of the Arab people, forcing them to surrender to the aggressors." In the United Nations, "the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists has reached its peak." This monthly publication said: "The revisionists have once again exposed their counter-revolutionary scab and servant and running dog role for U.S. imperialism."

    各国人民怒斥美帝侵略痛骂苏修叛卖
    比利时共产党政治局七日发表声明说：“篡夺了苏联政权的修正主义叛徒的本性再次暴露出来了。他们过去和现在，都同美国法西斯帝国主义互相勾结，完全一致地采取行动，反对巴勒斯坦人民，反对阿拉伯各国人民。”
    声明指出，联合国在美苏共同操纵下，玩弄“停火”阴谋，“再次鼓励和帮助帝国主义的侵略”。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松七日发表声明指出，正当阿拉伯国家掀起反对美帝国主义侵略的风暴的时候，苏修在联合国安理会伙同美国投票通过“停火决议”，这是它的又一严重叛卖行为。这证明，它同美帝勾结在一起，完全践踏阿拉伯人民的正当要求。
    锡兰共产党英文周刊《红旗》七日发表社论指出，以色列是美英帝国主义插在阿拉伯国家心脏的匕首，它充当帝国主义的代理人和工具，为帝国主义的利益效劳。
    社论说，苏修在美英帝国主义和以色列的侵略中，扮演了出卖阿拉伯人民的不光彩的角色。它一方面口头上支持阿拉伯事业，而行动上却在秘密地出卖阿拉伯国家。
    “泰国人民之声”电台七日发表评论说，有侵略就必然有反侵略。阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争是正义的斗争，得到全世界各国人民的全力支持。
    评论说，尽管美帝国主义勾结英帝国主义和苏修领导集团，企图扑灭正在越烧越旺的阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的怒火，但是它们的企图和努力是决不能得逞的。
    法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）机关刊《红卫兵》月刊最近出版特刊，愤怒谴责苏联修正主义领导集团同美国侵略者勾结，叛卖阿拉伯国家人民的利益。这家月刊指出，苏联修正主义者所干的勾当是“在阿拉伯各国人民背上刺了一刀”，“让美国佬为所欲为”。
    它说：“苏修积极活动，企图扑灭阿拉伯各国人民的抵抗，迫使他们向侵略者投降。”在联合国，“苏联修正主义者的叛卖达到了登峰造极的地步。”这家月刊说：“修正主义者再次暴露了他们反革命工贼和充当美帝国主义仆从和走狗的真面目。”　（据新华社讯）
