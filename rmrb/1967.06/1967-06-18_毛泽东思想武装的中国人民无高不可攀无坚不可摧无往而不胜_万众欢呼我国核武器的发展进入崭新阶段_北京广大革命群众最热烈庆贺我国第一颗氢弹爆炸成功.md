The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible, indomitable, and unbeatable. The masses enthusiastically hail the entry of our country's nuclear weapons development into a new stage. The broad revolutionary masses of Beijing warmly celebrate the successful detonation of our country's first hydrogen bomb.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 17th, today, our country's first hydrogen bomb has been successfully detonated! The great leader Chairman Mao's wise foresight and great call have been realized! The joyous news spread, and the entire capital was submerged in boundless joy. The broad revolutionary masses were overjoyed, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Chairman Mao lives ten thousand years!" They celebrated the great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

In Tiananmen Square, at Beijing Railway Station, in schools, in offices, in factories, in suburban rural areas, both in the city and the countryside, drums and gongs resounded, and there was a scene of great rejoicing. Wherever the big red characters of the *People's Daily*'s *Bulletin of Joy* were delivered, there was immediate rejoicing. The reception center for the masses by the Party Central Committee and the State Council was the center of the entire capital's rejoicing. People carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held up red flags, and carried *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, surging forward like a tide to celebrate.

Shouts of joy, drumbeats, and firecrackers echoed through the night, ceaselessly.

The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital pointed out in a large number of letters of congratulations and bulletins of joy that the successful detonation of our country's first hydrogen bomb marks another leap in the development of our country's nuclear weapons and marks the entry of the development of our country's nuclear weapons into a new stage. It declares the complete failure of the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. It shows that the Chinese people armed with the boundless Mao Zedong Thought are invincible, indomitable, and unbeatable.

The red rebels of the Beijing Bed Sheet Factory came to the reception center for the masses and scattered leaflets with red "double happiness" characters into the joyous sea. The leaflets sang: "Mountains are rejoicing, seas are laughing. Rejoice in the great victory song of Mao Zedong Thought, rejoice in the great glorious achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and community members of Dongsheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing were filled with the joy of a bumper harvest as they rushed to harvest at night. The news of joy spread, and the community members shouted in delight. More than fifty poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, carrying the wishes of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, rushed into the city at night to report the joy to Chairman Mao. They said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force of the revolution and production. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end! At present, we must definitely win the summer harvest battle and respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'grasp revolution and promote production' with actual actions." Many community members, cadres, and People's Liberation Army soldiers who came to support the summer harvest in Zhong-A Friendship Commune listened to the broadcast of the joyous news, ran to tell each other, wrote slogans, printed leaflets, and prepared for the celebration meeting at night.

The revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of Beijing Normal University were extremely excited and said, "The successful detonation of our country's first hydrogen bomb is a heavy blow to the anti-China grand chorus currently being performed by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. This brilliant achievement supports the people of the world who are fighting against imperialism and revisionism, supports the Vietnamese people and the Arab people who are in the midst of the struggle, and supports the struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against the persecution of British imperialism. It solemnly declares to the world: the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fully capable of fulfilling their international duties. We will 'sweep away all harmful insects and have no enemies.' Let the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries tremble before the revolutionary people!"

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who are in the midst of a high tide of criticism, heard the joyous news, ran to tell each other, were elated, and the entire academy immediately boiled over. More than seven thousand people held a rally and parade. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams sang and danced, praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and wishing our red sun in the heart, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the capital's literary and artistic front, who have united and actively participated in the great criticism and struggle, heard the joyous news, and many immediately went to the streets to propagate this great joy to the masses. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers from other places who came to Beijing to perform revolutionary model operas *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, *The Harbor*, *Attack on the White Tiger Regiment*, and *The White-Haired Girl* also came to the reception center for the masses to report the joy.

Many foreign comrades and friends in Beijing also joined the parade of the revolutionary masses of the capital with boundless joy in their hearts. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao, waved red *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, and in front of the reception center for the masses by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"
