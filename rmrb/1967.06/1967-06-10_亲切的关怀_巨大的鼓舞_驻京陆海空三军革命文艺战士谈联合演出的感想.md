On the evening of the 9th, revolutionary art troops from the PLA's ground, naval, and air forces stationed in Beijing held a grand joint performance at the solemn and dignified Great Hall of the People.

At 8:30, the auditorium erupted in thunderous applause. Look, our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao has arrived, along with Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun, Comrade Jiang Qing, and others. What a stirring moment! What an unforgettable moment!

Over 400 revolutionary art troops, with the most excited hearts, sang passionately about the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, about the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, and about the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on arts. They used revolutionary and combative songs and dances as weapons to fiercely attack the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Comrade Lin Biao and other central leaders watched the performance intently from beginning to end, applauding the success of each performance. What warm care! What great inspiration! At this moment, the revolutionary art troops had so much to say to our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, to Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and to our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing!

Soloist Zhang Yingzhe from the Revolutionary Committee of the Air Force Political Department Art Troupe was so moved that she was in tears and could not speak for a long time. She said: Today, Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders came to watch our performance, which is the greatest inspiration and care for us revolutionary art troops, and also the greatest encouragement. We will definitely follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, always study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and always propagate Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party did not allow us to sing praises of Mao Zedong Thought and did not give us the opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. After this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have exposed the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and now we have the right and opportunity to sing loudly in praise of our great leader Chairman Mao and to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. We have a thousand words, but they all boil down to one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

Soloist Ma Guang from the Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Military Region Friendship Art Troupe said: I saw Vice Chairman Lin looking radiant, and I was indescribably happy, with endless songs in my heart. I picked up my songbook, flipping through it, not knowing which song to sing. Finally, I decided to sing "The Three Articles," which is an important instruction from Vice Chairman Lin. The praises of our great leader Chairman Mao are endless, and I will sing them for a lifetime.

Warrior Sun Kairui from the "Red Rebel Fleet" of the Naval Political Department Art Troupe and Military Band said: Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders have given us great inspiration. Seeing them arrive, I felt especially energized every time I sang "Long live Chairman Mao" during the performance of "The Glory of the Sailor." I will sing praises of Chairman Mao for a lifetime, I will be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, and I will never forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. If anyone does not let me sing praises of Chairman Mao, I will overthrow them.

After the performance, Comrade Lin Biao, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun, Comrade Jiang Qing, and others came onto the stage, amidst applause and cheers, to warmly congratulate the performers. The entire auditorium was swept up in another wave of joy. After the central leaders left, the performers, who were extremely moved, still gathered on the stage. Wave after wave of "Long live Chairman Mao" cheers burst forth from the depths of their hearts. The warm care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central will be transformed into boundless fighting strength in the revolutionary art troops of the ground, naval, and air forces!

    亲切的关怀　巨大的鼓舞
    ——驻京陆海空三军革命文艺战士谈联合演出的感想
    九日晚上，人民解放军驻京陆海空三军的革命文艺战士，在庄严肃穆的人民大会堂举行隆重的联合演出。
    八时半，全场爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。看，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志来了，周恩来同志、陈伯达同志、康生同志、李富春同志、江青同志等都来了。这是多么振奋人心的时刻啊！这是多么令人难忘的时刻啊！
    四百多个革命文艺战士怀着最激动的心情，纵情歌唱我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，歌唱光焰无际的毛泽东思想，歌唱毛主席的革命文艺路线的巨大胜利。他们以革命的战斗的歌曲和舞蹈作刀枪，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。
    林彪同志和中央其他负责同志自始至终全神贯注地观看着演出，为每个节目演出的成功鼓掌。这是多么亲切的关怀！多么巨大的鼓舞！此时此刻，革命文艺战士们有多少心里话要向最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，向毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，向敬爱的江青同志倾吐啊！
    空政文工团革命委员会独唱演员张映哲激动得热泪盈眶，久久说不出话来。她说：今天林副主席和中央其他首长们来观看我们的演出，是对我们革命文艺战士最大的鼓舞，最大的关怀，也是对我们最大的鞭策。我们一定遵照林副主席的指示，永远活学活用毛主席著作，永远宣传毛泽东思想。过去，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不让我们歌颂毛泽东思想，不给我们宣传毛泽东思想的机会。经过这次史无前例的文化大革命，揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，我们有了放声歌唱伟大领袖毛主席和宣传毛泽东思想的权利和机会了。我们千言万语，并成一句话：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    北京部队战友文工团革命委员会临时筹委会独唱演员马国光说：我看到林副主席神采奕奕，心里有着说不出来的高兴，有着唱不完的歌曲。我拿起我的歌本，挑来挑去，不知道唱那一支歌好。后来才选定唱《老三篇》，学好用好“老三篇”，这是林副主席的重要指示。伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌永远唱不完，我要唱一辈子。
    海政文工团、军乐队“红色造反舰队”战士孙开瑞说：林副主席和中央其他首长给了我们极大的鼓舞。看到他们来了，我在参加《水兵的光荣》一剧演出中，每唱一句“毛主席万岁”，都感到特别有劲。我一辈子都要歌唱毛主席，我一辈子都要作毛泽东思想的宣传员，一辈子都要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。谁要不让我歌唱毛主席，我就打倒谁。
    演出结束后，林彪同志、周恩来同志、陈伯达同志、康生同志、李富春同志、江青同志等走上台来，在一片掌声和欢呼声中向演员们亲切祝贺。整个剧场又掀起了欢乐的高潮。中央负责同志走后，万分激动的演员们还簇拥在台上，一阵阵的“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声，从每一个人的内心深处迸发出来。毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀，将在陆海空三军的革命文艺战士身上化为无限巨大的战斗力量！
