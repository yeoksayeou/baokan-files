Because of victory, feelings of arrogance, the sense of being a hero, the tendency to stagnate and not seek progress, and the desire for enjoyment and unwillingness to endure hardship may grow within the Party. Because of victory, the people will thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, as has been proven. However, the bourgeoisie's flattery may conquer the weak-willed among our ranks.

From the report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    毛主席语录
    因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。
      《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》
