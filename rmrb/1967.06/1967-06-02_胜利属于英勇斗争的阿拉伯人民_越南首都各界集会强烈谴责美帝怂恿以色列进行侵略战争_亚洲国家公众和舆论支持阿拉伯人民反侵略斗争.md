	The Asian-African People's Solidarity Council of Japan issued a statement on June 1st firmly supporting the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle.

	The statement said that in the face of aggression by US imperialism and Israel, the Arab people have united and launched a struggle, and the Japanese people firmly support this.

	The statement condemned the treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The statement said that the Soviet revisionists confuse the boundaries between the aggressors and the victims, peddling so-called "Tashkent spirit" of peaceful coexistence, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle under the pretext of maintaining "peace" and colluding with US imperialism.

	The statement expressed confidence that as long as the Arab people strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, the final victory will definitely belong to the Arab people.

	The Central Labor Committee of Pakistan, representing 50 cities' trade unions, announced on May 28th that they fully support the struggle of the Palestinian people and other Arab people against the United States and its tool, Israel.

	Lahore's 17 social, cultural, and labor organizations jointly passed a resolution on May 29th, condemning Johnson's unreasonable statement that does not recognize Egypt's rights over the Gulf of Aqaba, and expressing support for Arab countries' struggle against Israel, which is sheltered by US and British war mongers.

	The East Pakistan Committee of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau, chaired by Rahman, issued a statement to the press on May 28th, saying that the imperialists, relying on the US Sixth Fleet, have provoked Egypt in the Gulf of Aqaba, which is a despicable act of aggression and a blatant violation of international law.

	On May 31st, the famous Burmese writer Du Ama published an article in the "People's Daily" saying: "The revolutionary flames of the Middle Eastern Arab countries against US and British imperialism are burning fiercely. The struggle of the Arab people against imperialism is inevitable. Revolutionary people around the world firmly support the Arab people's just struggle." She said: "The United Nations, controlled by imperialists and reactionaries, cannot solve the problem of imperialist aggression against Arab countries. From the various issues interfered by the United Nations, it can be seen that all interventions and aggressions by imperialists against other countries are considered legal."

	Du Ama also condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's despicable attitude towards the Arab people's struggle against US imperialism's aggression.

	The Kabul Times of Afghanistan published an editorial on May 29th, saying that the only way to solve the Middle East problem is to recognize and restore the inalienable rights of the Palestinian Arab people.

	The "Motherland News" of Cambodia published a commentary on June 1st on the Middle East issue, saying: "Despite the aggressive threats of US imperialism and its lackeys, the broad masses of the Arab countries are not intimidated. The prominent feature of the current situation is that US imperialism can no longer act as it pleases in the world as it did in the past."

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on May 31st, representatives of various circles in Hanoi held a rally on the evening of May 30th, enthusiastically supporting the Arab people's just struggle against US imperialism and its tool, Israel.

	Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, Sun Guanghuai, Deputy Foreign Minister Huang Wenli, and representatives of various parties and people's organizations attended the rally.

	Deputy Secretary-General of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, Huang Bei, spoke at the rally, strongly condemning the US and British imperialists' incitement of the Israeli reactionary regime to provoke Syria and Egypt and prepare to launch an aggressive war, and highly praising the Arab people's resolute will to fight back against the aggressors and their spirit of united struggle.

	Huang Bei emphasized that the Vietnamese military and people will resolutely foil the US imperialists' plot to expand the war in Vietnam to support the struggle of the Arab people.
