The entire revolutionary comrades of the People's Literature Publishing House

The top capitalist-roader within the Party has long been engaged in various anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities to achieve his evil goal of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat. His hands are long, reaching into various fields. The People's Literature Publishing House is one of the fronts he uses to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The four poisonous weeds—film "Sparking the Prairie Fire," industrial history "Red Anshan," long poem "Labor Record," and long novel "Spring and Autumn of Coal City"—were all planned personally by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, using the same theme to serve the same reactionary political purpose. The birth of "Red Anshan" is a typical example. During the writing process, the top capitalist-roader within the Party summoned the author to Beijing, giving him instructions on what to write and what not to write, hinting that he should erect monuments and build shrines for himself, and personally approving the drafts and proofs. Look! This Chinese Khrushchev is so meticulous about this poisonous weed!

Under the instructions of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, this poisonous weed, "Red Anshan," shamelessly distorts history, constantly highlighting and beautifying the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and sparing no effort to sing his praises and build monuments for him. The first illustration in the book is his handwritten letter to the Anshan Town Workers' Union in 1955. Following that, there is a large photo of him receiving Anshan workers' model workers. What is most intolerable is that out of more than ten photos in the entire book, there is not a single photo of our great leader Chairman Mao. Here, the top capitalist-roader within the Party's wolfish ambition to belittle Chairman Mao and elevate himself is evident!

This poisonous weed uses a large amount of space to flatter the top capitalist-roader within the Party, turning this coward who trembled under the guns of imperialists and reactionary warlords into a "hero" with "courage in every inch of his body"; turning this butcher who suppressed the workers' revolutionary movement into an "enlightened" and "outstanding" leader of the workers; turning this running dog of the bourgeoisie who betrayed the interests of the workers into the "great savior" of the workers, and even shamelessly calling him the "eternal king." Chairman Mao's immortal historical merits are completely erased, which is intolerable!

Despite this, the top capitalist-roader within the Party is still not satisfied. He instructed the publishing house to publish another long novel, "Spring and Autumn of Coal City." This poisonous weed is massive, planned to be written in three volumes, with the first volume alone having 600,000 words, already completed and awaiting publication. After giving instructions, the author openly declared that these three volumes would be written as the "History of the Chinese Workers' Movement." However, in this so-called history of the workers' movement, Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership in Anshan is completely omitted, using the method of "stealing heaven and changing the day" to attribute all of Chairman Mao's decisive leadership activities in Anshan to the top capitalist-roader within the Party, which is truly shameless!

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a spring thunder, shattered the top capitalist-roader within the Party's beautiful dream of restoring capitalism, and this poisonous weed intended to build monuments for the Chinese Khrushchev did not come out as planned.

On December 12, 1963, Chairman Mao sharply pointed out the crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles in the ideological field. Chairman Mao said: "Various forms of art—drama, folk art, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and the socialist transformation in many departments has achieved very little so far. Many departments are still ruled by 'dead people.' Many communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist art. Isn't this strange?"

Chairman Mao's wise instructions hit the nail on the head, exposing the essence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles, which has the top capitalist-roader within the Party as its backer. To cover up their crimes and resist desperately, the top ambitionist within the Party, under the pretext of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, convened a symposium on literary and artistic work. At the meeting, they openly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions, saying that it was not necessarily a "line error" but a "problem of understanding," and that there was only a "distance" in the actual implementation of the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism. This was a black meeting under the guise of a "red flag"!

After that, they carried out a series of intense conspiratorial activities to further resist Chairman Mao's instructions. In May 1964, the top capitalist-roader within the Party personally wrote a letter to the big demon Lu Dingyi, instructing the old Propaganda Department to fabricate a false statistical report on the translation and publication of foreign literature. This so-called statistical report included the situation of four publishing houses—People's Literature Publishing House, Shanghai New Literature Publishing House, Chinese Youth Publishing House, and Time Publishing House—translating and publishing foreign literary works from 1949 to 1963. The top capitalist-roader within the Party, through his henchmen in the old Propaganda Department, gave various black instructions in advance on how to fabricate this false statistical report. They claimed to be conducting a comprehensive statistics, but in reality, they only allowed the statistics of classical works from the 18th and 19th centuries, and works from ancient Greece, ancient Rome, ancient East, the Renaissance, to the 17th-century Enlightenment period were all not allowed to be included. In this way, the proportion of classical works was greatly reduced. They also stipulated that regardless of the ideological content, as long as the works were by Soviet, Eastern European countries, and communist party members in capitalist countries, they were all considered proletarian revolutionary literature. Modern works from Europe, America, and Asia, Africa, and Latin America were similarly not questioned about their ideological tendencies and were all considered progressive works against imperialism and colonialism. They even stipulated "not to discard the words because of the person" and that "all books published when the author had not yet gone bad were good books." Thus, the infamous traitors like Sholokhov, Ehrenburg, Simonov, Aragon, and Fast, their works were also counted as "revolutionary literature," and "And Quiet Flows the Don," "Virgin Soil Upturned," and "The Storm" became good books. In this way, the proportion of so-called "revolutionary works" was greatly increased.

In addition, they stipulated that as long as there was a so-called "preface" or "afterword" in form, it was considered "disinfected" and "critically inherited." In fact, most of these "prefaces" and "afterwords" were poisonous weeds written by bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities," advocating worship of foreign cultures, ancient cultures, and revisionism, and there was no question of criticism.

Based on these black instructions, the fabricated statistical report showed that from 1951 to 1963, the People's Literature Publishing House published foreign literary works, with "revolutionary works" by "proletarian" and "working-class" writers reaching 67.2%, while 18th and 19th-century classical works only accounted for 32.4%, and 70% of them were "disinfected." As for works with "political errors," there was only one, "The Forty-First."

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by the top capitalist-roader within the Party used such extremely cunning, deceitful, and at the same time extremely stupid and despicable methods to attempt to resist and deny Chairman Mao's great instructions. They thought they had succeeded, but the result was that they "lifted the stone to hit their own feet," completely exposing their counter-revolutionary two-faced nature!

In 1962, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle"; in December 1963 and June 1964, Chairman Mao made two extremely important instructions on the serious problems in the literary and artistic circles. The counter-revolutionary literary black line backer panicked and quickly adopted an offensive strategy, vigorously promoting so-called "anti-capitalist" works.

In 1964, he said that "socialist literature has no other purpose but to oppose capitalism" and that there were many foreign works against capitalism, but few were translated and published. The master gave the order, and Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi followed suit, shouting loudly, while Zhou Yang personally took action, organizing and reviewing so-called "anti-capitalist" works everywhere. The capitalist-roader within the Party in the People's Literature Publishing House was also very enthusiastic. After scrambling all over the country, five so-called "anti-capitalist" works were thrown out in 1965 alone.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party has always advocated "exploitation is meritorious," but at this time, he suddenly changed his tune and fabricated so-called "anti-capitalist" works, which had his sinister purpose.

He used "anti-capitalist" as a banner to disguise himself, deceive the masses, and resist Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle. Chairman Mao taught us: in the socialist period, "class struggle has not ended," and said that this struggle "is still a long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce one." The top capitalist-roader within the Party sang the opposite tune, maliciously stipulating that "anti-capitalist" works "only write about anti-capitalist themes in history." This set the framework, and all such works only wrote about the economic struggle between the working class and capitalists before liberation, without touching on the life-and-death political struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, let alone writing about the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the socialist revolutionary period after liberation. The master gave the order, and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Propaganda Department's demon hall followed his black instructions, instructing that "anti-capitalist" works "mainly write about capitalists," not writing about the resistance and struggle of the working class; instructing to "write about the two-faced nature of the bourgeoisie," not just writing about the exploitation side, to consider the united front relationship. Based on these black instructions, the works written were full of class capitulationism, economism, and class cooperation.

Enough! The Chinese Khrushchev's wolfish ambition to restore capitalism has also been exposed through the People's Literature Publishing House!

However, those who resist the historical trend, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how high their usurped positions are and how rich their counter-revolutionary experience is, will not have a good ending! The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country, under the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the brilliant guidance of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, finally exposed this top capitalist-roader within the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought that shines across the world, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    揭发头号野心家利用文学出版阵地搞的三个大阴谋
    人民文学出版社全体革命同志
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来，为了实现其颠覆无产阶级专政的罪恶目的，进行了种种反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。他的黑手很长，伸到了各个领域。人民文学出版社便是他用来为复辟资本主义制造舆论的一个阵地。
    电影《燎原》、工矿史《红色的安源》、长诗《劳工记》、长篇小说《煤城春秋》这四株大毒草，就是在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的亲自策划下，利用同一个题材，为同一个反动政治目的服务的。《红色的安源》的出笼，是一个典型的例子。在编写过程中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派曾把作者召来北京，面授机宜，教给他什么该写，什么不该写，暗示他为自己树碑立传，还亲自审定原稿和校样。看！这个中国的赫鲁晓夫对这株大毒草抓得多么紧！
    在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派授意下，《红色的安源》这株大毒草，肆意篡改历史，处处突出、美化党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，挖空心思为他歌功颂德，树碑立传。翻开书的第一张插图就是他一九五五年写给安源镇工会的黑信手稿。紧接着，又是他接见安源工人劳模的大幅照片。最不能令人容忍的是：全书十多幅照片中，竟没有一张我们伟大领袖毛主席的照片。这里，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派贬低毛主席，抬高他自己的狼子野心，昭然若揭！
    这株大毒草，用了大量的篇幅，肉麻地吹捧党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把这个在帝国主义和反动军阀的枪口下吓得发抖的胆小鬼，吹捧成“一身是胆”的“英雄”；把这个镇压工人革命运动的大刽子手，吹捧为“英明”、“杰出”的工人“领袖”；把这个出卖工人利益的资产阶级走狗，吹捧为“工人的大救星”，甚至无耻地称他为“万岁王”。毛主席不朽的历史功勋却被一笔抹煞，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    尽管如此，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派还不满足，他示意出版社再出版一部长篇小说《煤城春秋》。这株大毒草，规模庞大，计划要写三大卷，头一卷六十万字，已经脱稿，等待出笼。在他面授机宜后，作者公然宣称这三大卷要写成“中国工人运动史”。但是，在这部所谓的工人运动史中，绝口不提我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，采取偷天换日的手法，把毛主席在安源的具有决定性的领导活动，全加到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的身上，真是无耻！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，象一声春雷，粉碎了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，这株为中国的赫鲁晓夫树碑立传的大毒草，才没有按原计划出笼。
    一九六三年十二月十二日，毛主席尖锐地指出了文艺界反革命修正主义集团在意识形态方面进行反革命复辟的罪行。毛主席说：“各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着。”“许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。”
    毛主席的英明批示，一针见血地击中了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为总后台的文艺界反革命修正主义集团的要害。为了掩盖罪责，负隅顽抗，党内头号野心家假借中央政治局名义，召开了一个文艺工作座谈会。会上，他们公开抵制毛主席的批示，胡说什么“不一定是路线错误”，而“是认识问题”，只是“对为工农兵、为社会主义服务的方向……在实际执行中有距离。”这是一次打着“红旗”反红旗的黑会！
    在这以后，他们又进行了一系列紧张的阴谋活动，进一步对抗毛主席的批示。一九六四年五月党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派亲自写信给大阎王陆定一，布置旧中宣部搞的一个关于外国文学翻译出版情况的假统计材料，就是这一系列阴谋活动的一个组成部分。这个所谓的统计材料，包括人民文学出版社、上海新文艺出版社、中国青年出版社、时代出版社等四个出版社从一九四九年——一九六三年翻译出版外国文学作品的情况。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派通过他在旧中宣部的爪牙，事先对于如何编造这个假统计，下达了种种黑指示。他们表面上说是全面统计，暗地里却规定只统计十八、十九世纪的古典作品，其他从古希腊、古罗马、古代东方、文艺复兴，到十七世纪启蒙主义时期的作品，都一概不准统计在内。这样一来，古典作品的比例便大大下降。他们又规定凡是苏联、东欧各国和资本主义国家共产党员作家的作品，不论其思想内容如何，也不论是否修字号的党，都一律作为无产阶级革命文艺。欧美和亚非拉地区的现代作品，同样不问其思想倾向，一律作为反帝反殖民主义的进步作品，甚至还规定“不要因人废言”，“凡是作品出版时作者没有变坏的都算好书”。于是，肖洛霍夫、爱伦堡、西蒙诺夫、阿拉贡、法斯特这些臭名昭著的叛徒的作品，也通通算作“革命文学”，《静静的顿河》、《被开垦的处女地》、《暴风雨》，都成了好书。这样一来，所谓“革命作品”的比重便大大增加。
    此外，他们还规定，只要形式上有一个所谓“前言”或“后记”，就通通算是“消了毒的”，是“批判继承”的。其实，这些“前言”、“后记”，绝大部分是资产阶级“学者”、“权威”写的崇洋、崇古、崇修的毒草，根本谈不上什么批判。
    根据这些黑指示编造出来的统计材料，人民文学出版社从一九五一到一九六三年十二年中出版的外国文学作品中，“无产阶级”和“劳动人民”作家的“革命作品”竟高达百分之六十七点二，而十八、十九世纪古典作品只有百分之三十二点四，而且其中百分之七十都是“消了毒”的。至于“有政治思想错误的作品”，仅仅只有《第四十一》一种。
    以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的反革命修正主义集团，用这种极其阴险，极其狡猾，同时也是极其愚蠢卑鄙的手法，妄图抗拒和否定毛主席的伟大批示。他们自以为得计，结果是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，彻底暴露了他们反革命两面派的真面目！
    一九六二年，毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召；一九六三年十二月和一九六四年六月，毛主席又针对文艺界的严重问题，作了两次极为重要的批示。反革命文艺黑线总后台这时慌了手脚，赶忙采取了以攻为守的策略，大抓所谓“揭资”作品。
    就在一九六四年，他胡说什么：“社会主义的文艺没有别的，就是反对资本主义”，说什么外国“反对资本主义的东西很多，就是我们翻译出版的很少”。主子一声令下，彭真、陆定一紧跟着大嚷大叫，周扬更是亲自出马，到处组织、审查所谓“揭资”作品。人民文学出版社党内走资本主义道路的当权派也十分卖劲。经过到全国各地死抓活抓，在一九六五年一年里就抛出了五部所谓“揭资”作品。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一贯宣扬“剥削有功”，这时候却一反常态，炮制所谓“揭资”作品，是有他的阴险目的的。
    他把“揭资”当作一面旗帜，伪装自己，蒙蔽群众，对抗毛主席的阶级斗争学说。毛主席教导我们：在社会主义时期，“阶级斗争并没有结束”，又说，这一斗争“还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大唱反调，他用心险恶地规定：“揭资”作品“只写历史上的反资题材”。这就定下框框，所有这类作品，只写解放前工人阶级同资本家的经济斗争，毫不涉及无产阶级同资产阶级在政治上的你死我活的斗争，更不能写解放以后社会主义革命时期两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。主子一声令下，旧中宣部阎王殿的一小撮反革命修正主义分子秉承他的黑旨意，指示“揭资”作品“主要写资本家”，不写工人阶级的反抗和斗争；指示“要写资产阶级两面性”，不能光写剥削一面，以照顾统战关系。根据这些黑旨意写出来的作品，大肆宣扬阶级投降主义、经济主义和阶级合作。
    够了！中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图实现资本主义复辟的狼子野心，通过人民文学出版社这个侧面，也暴露出来了！
    但是，抗拒历史潮流，反对社会主义，反对毛泽东思想的人，不管他窃踞的地位多高，反革命的经验多么丰富，都没有好下场！我国亿万革命群众，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，终于把这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了。这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
