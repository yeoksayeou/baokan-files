The fifth plenary meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists Association has concluded successfully. Delegates from member countries, guided by the great thought of Mao Zedong, engaged in heated, democratic, and extensive discussions on the most urgent common tasks facing Asian and African journalists and peoples, and adopted a series of important resolutions. This meeting is a gathering of revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa who hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and a meeting that persists in the revolutionary line of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and Asian-African unity. By taking the great thought of Mao Zedong as the guiding principle and powerful ideological weapon for the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary struggle of the Asian and African peoples and journalists, the Asian and African Journalists Association has written a new chapter in the history of the struggle of revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the significant achievements of this meeting.

This meeting was convened at a time when the world has entered the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories, and when the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries has deepened. The new and excellent revolutionary situation in the world has put new demands and tasks of struggle before all progressive journalists in the Asian and African regions. The brilliant achievements and the series of resolutions adopted by this meeting not only address the current tasks of struggle for Asian and African journalists but also point out the direction for future struggles. This will have a profound impact on the further deepening of the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

This meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists Association is a powerful denunciation by the 2 billion fighting peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership and the reactionaries of various countries. In the plenary meeting filled with the atmosphere of fighting unity, the Asian and African journalists displayed a magnificent spirit of daring to revolution and daring to win. The resolutions passed by the meeting on issues such as the Middle East, Vietnam, and Africa firmly oppose imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism, especially the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, the number one enemy of the peoples of the world. They firmly oppose the treacherous acts of the Soviet modern revisionists against the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples. They firmly support the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the Asian and African regions and the world. The Chinese people warmly welcome the decision made by this plenary meeting to hold the second Asian and African Journalists Conference in the People's Republic of China.

At this plenary meeting, the representatives unanimously agreed that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with American imperialism and its lackey Israel in their aggression against the Arab countries, has thoroughly exposed the Soviet revisionists as the number one accomplice of American imperialism and the sworn enemy of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. The handful of pseudo-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries represented by Soviet modern revisionism will inevitably be swept away by the torrent of the united struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world against imperialism.

Chairman Mao pointed out: To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. This is true for the revolutionary class and also for the counter-revolutionary class. Newspapers, periodicals, radio broadcasts, etc., are powerful tools for creating public opinion. On the Asian and African news front, there has always been an extremely sharp and complex struggle between the two lines of revolution and counter-revolution.

The Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists Association has consistently adhered to the revolutionary line, engaged in the just revolutionary cause, and made significant contributions to the unity of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle against imperialism. Therefore, it has been supported and endorsed by the broad masses of revolutionary journalists and peoples in Asia and Africa, and possesses an extremely vigorous and powerful vitality.

At this meeting, the representatives, in their speeches, enthusiastically praised the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, and the boundless glory of Mao Zedong Thought. They firmly supported China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese people sincerely thank the Secretariat meeting of the Asian and African Journalists Association for its correct evaluation of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and its support for our country's Cultural Revolution. We are firmly convinced that Asian and African journalists, by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in their struggles, taking Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to action, and widely spreading Mao Zedong Thought among the Asian and African peoples, will definitely make new and extremely valuable contributions to the great cause of the unity of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle against imperialism.

Under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. This cultural revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of people, eliminated the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, ensured that socialist China will never change color, and will forever remain a reliable rear base and a solid stronghold for the revolutionary peoples of the world. Widely publicizing the great significance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution among the Asian and African peoples, thoroughly exposing the shameless lies of imperialism and modern revisionism, will definitely bring the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples into a more vigorous stage of development. In this regard, the efforts of revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa are of great significance.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the people's journalists "must have the spirit of serving the people and engage in arduous work." We believe that all progressive journalists in Asia and Africa, as long as they are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen unity, establish and develop a broad and genuine international united front against American imperialism, grasp the pen firmly, and throw themselves into the fiery struggle, will definitely play a greater role and make more contributions in the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and for strengthening Asian-African unity.

    亚非新闻工作者团结起来坚持反帝反修的革命路线
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第五次全体会议，已于昨天胜利地闭幕了。出席全会的各成员国代表，以伟大的毛泽东思想为指针，就亚非新闻工作者和亚非人民当前面临的最迫切的共同斗争任务，进行了热烈的、民主的、广泛的讨论，通过了一系列重要决议。这是亚非革命的新闻工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大旗帜的会议，是坚持反帝、反修和亚非团结的革命路线的会议。亚非记协把伟大的毛泽东思想作为亚非人民、亚非新闻工作者进行反帝反修革命斗争的指导原则和强大的思想武器，在亚非革命新闻工作者斗争史上写下了崭新的一页。中国人民热烈祝贺这次会议所取得的重大成就。
    这次会议是在当前世界发展到了毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，中国的无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利，全世界革命人民，特别是亚非拉革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争深入发展的时候召开的。新的大好的世界革命形势，向亚非地区一切进步的新闻工作者提出了新的要求和斗争任务。这次会议所取得的光辉成就和通过的一系列决议，不仅解决了亚非新闻工作者当前斗争任务的问题，而且指明了今后斗争的方向问题。这对亚非人民反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争的进一步深入发展，必将产生深远的影响。
    这次亚非记协书记处会议，是亚非战斗的二十亿人民向以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的一次有力的声讨。在充满战斗团结气氛的全会上，洋溢着亚非新闻工作者敢于革命、敢于胜利的磅礴气概。会议通过的关于中东形势、越南、非洲等问题的决议，坚决反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和现代修正主义，特别是坚决反对世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，坚决反对苏联现代修正主义者对亚非人民革命事业的叛卖行径。坚决支持亚非地区和全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争。中国人民热烈欢迎这次全会所作的关于第二次亚非新闻工作者会议在中华人民共和国召开的决定。
    在这次全会上，代表们一致认为，要反对帝国主义，就必须同时反对现代修正主义。苏修领导集团在美帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家发动的侵略战争中，勾结美帝国主义，出卖阿拉伯人民，彻底暴露了苏修是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，亚非革命人民的死敌。苏联现代修正主义者等一小撮假革命、反革命，必将被全世界革命人民团结反帝斗争的洪流所淹没。
    毛主席指出：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。报纸、刊物、广播等等，就是制造舆论的一种有力工具。在亚非新闻战线上，一直存在着革命与反革命的两条路线的极其尖锐复杂的斗争。
    亚非记协书记处一贯坚持革命的路线，从事着正义的革命事业，对亚非人民团结反帝事业作出了重大贡献，因而为广大的亚非革命新闻工作者和亚非人民所拥护和支持，具有无比旺盛的强大生命力。
    在这次会议上，参加会议的代表在发言中热情地歌颂世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，赞扬光焰无际的毛泽东思想，坚决地支持我国的无产阶级文化大革命。中国人民衷心地感谢亚非记协书记处会议对战无不胜的毛泽东思想作出的正确评价和对我国文化大革命的支持。我们坚信，亚非新闻工作者在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想作为自己行动的指南，在亚非人民中间广泛地传播毛泽东思想，就一定会对亚非人民团结反帝的伟大事业作出新的极其宝贵的贡献。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席的英明正确的领导下，获得了伟大的胜利。这场文化大革命，发动亿万群众，清除了埋伏在无产阶级专政机构内部的党内最大的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，保证了社会主义的中国永不变色，永远成为世界革命人民的可靠的后方和巩固的根据地。在亚非人民中间广泛宣传中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，彻底揭露帝国主义和现代修正主义者的无耻谎言，必将使亚非人民的反帝斗争进入一个更加蓬勃发展的新阶段。在这方面，亚非革命新闻工作者的努力，具有重要的意义。
    毛主席教导我们说，人民的新闻工作者“必须具有为人民服务的精神，从事艰苦的工作”。我们相信，亚非一切进步的新闻工作者，只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，加强团结，建立和发展广泛的、真正的反美国际统一战线，握紧手中的笔杆，投身到火热的斗争中去，一定会在亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、加强亚非团结的斗争中，发挥更大的作用，作出更多的贡献。
