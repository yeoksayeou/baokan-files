The delegation of Chinese Red Guards, bearing the greetings of our great leader Chairman Mao to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth Union, extends its highest respect to the great leader of the Albanian people, the great communist warrior, and the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the Albanian Labor Party, and to the Albanian people and youth!

The New China News Agency, Tirana, June 27 — At the invitation of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth Union, the delegation of Chinese Red Guards, led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, delivered a congratulatory speech on the afternoon of June 26. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear comrades and fellow fighters,

We, the delegation of Chinese Red Guards, bring the greetings of our great leader Chairman Mao to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth Union! On behalf of all the Red Guards of China, we extend proletarian revolutionary greetings to the delegates of the Congress! We express our highest respect and warmest greetings to the Albanian people and youth, to the Albanian Labor Party, and to the great leader of the Albanian people and our close friend, Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese Red Guards have a one-year history of struggle. However, this is the first time we have sent representatives abroad to participate in a conference. We are extremely pleased that our first international conference is with our closest comrades, the Albanians, and our first visit is to heroic Albania, which holds high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism. This is another living proof of the unbreakable fighting friendship between the two parties, the two countries' youth, and the two peoples!

Under the correct leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party, headed by the great communist warrior Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian Labor Youth Union and the broad revolutionary youth of Albania, together with the broad laboring masses of the country, have achieved great successes in implementing the various combat tasks set by the Fifth Congress of the Party. We, the Red Guards, warmly congratulate these achievements!

The Albanian people and youth have raised high the banner of struggle against American imperialism, resolutely opposing the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, firmly supporting the just war of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation, firmly supporting the just struggle of the Arab people against the aggression of American and British imperialism and their lackey Israel, firmly supporting the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and firmly supporting the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. You are indeed a steadfast and tested vanguard in the struggle against imperialism.

The Albanian people and youth have raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, with a clear and uncompromising stance, striking hard at the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, the Tito traitor clique, and various traitorous scoundrels. You have continuously exposed the crimes of the Soviet modern revisionist traitor clique in acting as a lackey of American imperialism, betraying the interests of the Soviet people and the revolution of the peoples of all countries. You have timely exposed the despicable tricks of the Soviet revisionists in using deceitful methods to repair their revisionist broken cart. You have ruthlessly exposed the reactionary essence of the counter-revolutionary black meeting convened by the new scoundrels of Europe, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others in Karlovy Vary. You have criticized the fallacy of the "middle road." You have strongly supported the revolutionary leftists in Europe and other countries, and strongly supported the leftist youth organizations in their struggles against imperialism and modern revisionism. You have set a brilliant example for revolutionary youth around the world!

The Albanian people and youth have powerfully raised the banner of the cultural revolution, launching a further attack on the ideology of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, you have strengthened political and ideological education for the youth, vigorously promoted the study of Marxism-Leninism. You have waged a fierce struggle against reactionary religious forces, sweeping away religious superstitions and backward customs that have poisoned people's spiritual world for thousands of years. You have struck hard at the old feudal customs that discriminate against and oppress women. You have criticized bureaucratism that alienates itself from the masses and harms the interests of the masses, implementing a system of rotation for leading organs and grassroots cadres. You have advocated and promoted the communist style of subordinating personal interests to the interests of the proletariat as a whole, reducing high wages, abolishing many additional allowances, and narrowing private plots. In the mass revolutionary movement, you have further promoted democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Your series of revolutionary measures and the revolutionary initiatives emerging from the masses have strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, promoted the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of youth and people, and made valuable contributions to the development of the socialist revolution and the prevention of capitalist restoration. The appearance of great communist warriors like Adam Reka, who sacrificed themselves for the public good in the Albanian people, is the best illustration of the great power of ideological revolutionization.

The socialist construction of Albania is advancing victoriously along the line set by the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party. The Albanian people have achieved remarkable successes in completing the tasks of the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The situation of industrial and agricultural production is good. The collectivization of mountainous areas has been successfully achieved. The broad revolutionary youth of Albania are full of enthusiasm and confidence, dedicating their youth to the realization of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. In many places, voluntary labor is being carried out with great enthusiasm. The land of Albania is everywhere a scene of prosperity, and socialist construction is entering a new upsurge.

Albanian youth have achieved brilliant results in the great struggle of building socialism and opposing imperialism and revisionism. As Comrade Enver Hoxha correctly evaluates: Albania's "youth have made great contributions in the struggle for liberation and socialist construction. Youth will inherit and carry forward our revolutionary cause, build a socialist society, and strive for the construction of communism. They will continue and deepen the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and will forever hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism."

Comrades! We, the Red Guards of China, are very pleased and inspired by the achievements of our brotherly Albanian youth and people, just as if they were our own achievements!

Chairman Mao says: "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great socialist beacon in Europe." Due to your new achievements in the class struggle at home and abroad and in socialist construction, this socialist beacon has become even brighter. These achievements are due to the heroic Albanian people and youth, to the glorious Albanian Labor Party, and to the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Hoxha!

Comrades! The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, has, after a year of stormy mass movement, achieved great victories of historic significance! The situation in both revolution and production is excellent.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is promoting a new leap in socialist construction. In the midst of the triumphant songs of our decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our first hydrogen bomb test has succeeded! This is a new victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! This is another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! It marks a new level in our country's scientific and technological development, industrial production, and national defense capabilities. This is a heavy blow to the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism! It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world and strikes a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Now, our industrial and agricultural production are both thriving. Industrial products have greatly increased in both quantity and quality compared to the same period last year. This year's summer harvest is a bumper harvest that excites people, and the autumn harvest may also be a bumper harvest.

After smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and others, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party who dream of restoring capitalism, in the style of Khrushchev, have been exposed by us Red Guards and the broad masses of the people! That book of betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposition to proletarian revolution, and advocacy of selfishness and slave philosophy, "On Cultivation," can no longer poison the youth and revolutionary masses under the guise of Marxism-Leninism! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory in smashing the restoration of capitalism! This is a great victory in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat!

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party points out: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party and the entire country."

The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. The theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the core of Marxism-Leninism revolutionary theory. In Chairman Mao's great creation of comprehensively inheriting, defending, and developing Marxism-Leninism, one of the most important contents is Chairman Mao's creative and epoch-making development of the Marxism-Leninism theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He has deeply analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, summed up the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, elucidated the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and formulated a series of theories, policies, and guidelines for carrying out revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a great revolution led by the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao at the helm, mobilizing hundreds of millions of people. This revolution starts from criticizing the representatives and works of the bourgeoisie in the ideological and cultural realm, exposing a group of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The purpose of the movement is to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. The method of the movement is to implement great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out great debates, big-character posters, and great criticism, to thoroughly implement the mass line, to support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, to respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, and to firmly believe in and rely on the majority of the people and cadres.

The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has once again proven that the Chinese Communist Party, with Comrade Mao Zedong at the helm, is a great, glorious, and correct party. Our country is a great country of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The plots and tricks of the enemy at home and abroad can only meet with shameful failure.

The American imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists spread all kinds of strange rumors to slander and attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They are most afraid of the revolutionary people rising up to rebel against them and overthrowing them. Facing the great revolutionary storm of tens of millions of people in China, they feel great terror. They are so frightened by the great power displayed by the Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution that they feel they will also be buried by the revolutionary tide of the people. Therefore, they shout and scream in panic, which proves that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has indeed hit them where it hurts the most!

Comrades! The Red Guards are the product of this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guard movement is a new form of revolutionary organization for youth that has emerged to adapt to the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Red Guards are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When this new thing, the Red Guards, just emerged on the horizon, it received the enthusiastic support and correct guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao personally received tens of millions of Red Guards from all over the country. On August 1, 1966, Chairman Mao's letter to the Red Guards is our general program.

Chairman Mao said: The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, "show anger and accusation against all the landlord class, bourgeoisie, imperialism, revisionism, and their running dogs who exploit and oppress workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary parties, show that it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries, and I express my enthusiastic support for you."

Chairman Mao also said: "We support you, but we also ask you to try to unite with all those who can be united. After pointing out the mistakes of those who have made serious mistakes, we should also give them the opportunity to work and correct their mistakes to become new people. Marx said that the proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all mankind. If the proletariat cannot liberate all mankind, it cannot finally liberate itself. This principle, I also ask comrades to pay attention to."

Chairman Mao's letter is the greatest support, greatest care, and greatest encouragement for us Red Guards! It is our highest directive!

Chairman Mao's letter deeply explains the nature and tasks of the Red Guard movement, which is to rebel against the landlord class, bourgeoisie, imperialism, revisionism, and their running dogs, to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, to launch a fierce attack on them, and to fight to the end with all the exploiting classes and their reactionary thoughts. The imperialists and modern revisionists hate us Red Guards so much because we want to rebel to the end until we completely eliminate these harmful insects.

Chairman Mao's letter points out that we must strive to unite with all those who can be united. We Red Guards, following Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the correct direction of the struggle in the Cultural Revolution, with the unity of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat as the core, strive to unite the broad masses of young people and the masses, and actively help those who have made mistakes but are not incorrigible and persistent to correct their mistakes. We Red Guards, while fighting, learn, and rectify our work style, learn to swim while swimming, learn to revolutionize while revolutionizing, constantly promote our proletarianization of thought, and strive to become reliable successors to the cause of communism.

Comrades! Chairman Mao is our Red Commander-in-Chief, and we are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. We have boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts. The slogan of the Red Guards is what Comrade Lin Biao said: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." Currently, in the great struggle of criticism, an unprecedentedly great movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is rising in our country, and a batch of new young proletarian revolutionary fighters who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought are growing up in the struggle.

We Chinese Red Guards have never forgotten our internationalist duty for a moment. We firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation and pledge to be their strong rear guard! We firmly support the Arab people's heroic struggle against American and British imperialism and their lackey Israel! We firmly support the just struggle of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to take up arms and overthrow the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its lackeys! We firmly support the leftist revolutionary organizations that are waging uncompromising struggles against revisionist parties! We warn American imperialism, this paper tiger: The Chinese Red Guards are a strong reserve force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We are fully prepared, and as soon as the motherland gives the order, we will rush to the front lines of battle and smash the imperialism led by the United States to pieces!

The Soviet modern revisionist traitor clique has become a disreputable bankrupt. They brutally suppress the Soviet people, their internal divisions are collapsing, and their false masks can no longer cover their counter-revolutionary ugly faces. The broken flag of "joint action" they wave is becoming less and less effective. Just as they did in Vietnam, they have recently once again shamelessly acted as lackeys of American imperialism, betraying the interests of the Arab people, and sabotaging the just war of the Arab people against American and British aggression, making the Arab people and the people of the world further see their despicable counter-revolutionary traitor faces. The Soviet revisionists and the Americans have become a pair of rats that everyone wants to beat. We will, together with the Albanian comrades and all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party to the end! We believe that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique will definitely not escape the just judgment of the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world! The revolutionary youth and working people of the Soviet Union will rise up in rebellion and thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeois privileged class represented by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others! The glorious banner of the October Revolution will one day be raised again over the Kremlin!

Dear comrades and fellow fighters,

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are sweet-tongued but treacherous, nor are we two-faced. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests."

Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "We highly value this true friendship between peoples. This is the friendship between revolutionaries, the friendship between comrades-in-arms who fight for the sacred ideals of socialism and communism, and therefore, it is immortal, evergreen, and will forever be invincible."

Comrades! Our goals of struggle are the same. Our hearts are tightly connected. Our revolutionary hands are tightly clasped. Our powerful revolutionary friendship is unbreakable by any force. In the great revolutionary struggles to come, the Chinese Red Guards will, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously study your proletarian revolutionary spirit, forever unite with you, fight with you, and win with you!

Long live the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth Union!

Long live the Albanian Labor Party and its beloved great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Albania!

Long live the great unity of the revolutionary peoples and youth of the world!

    姚文元同志向阿劳动青联五大致贺词热烈赞扬阿青年在反帝反修斗争中树立了光辉榜样
    中国红卫兵永远同阿尔巴尼亚青年团结战斗在一起
    中国红卫兵代表团，带来了我们伟大领袖毛主席对阿劳动青联五大的祝贺；并向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、伟大的共产主义战士、伟大的马列主义者霍查同志，向阿劳动党，向阿人民和青年，致最崇高的敬意！
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　应邀参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会的中国红卫兵代表团团长姚文元同志，二十六日下午，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会致贺词。贺词全文如下：亲爱的同志们、战友们！
    我们中国红卫兵代表团，带来了我们的伟大领袖毛主席对阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会的祝贺！我们代表全中国红卫兵战士，向代表大会的同志们，致以无产阶级的战斗的敬礼！我们向阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密朋友恩维尔·霍查同志，表示最崇高最热烈的敬意！
    我们中国红卫兵，在毛泽东主席的教导下，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，已经有了一年的战斗历史，但是，派出自己的代表出国参加会议，这还是第一次。使我们感到非常高兴的是，我们第一次参加的国际会议，是最亲密的战友阿尔巴尼亚同志的会议，我们第一个访问的国家，是高举马克思列宁主义革命红旗的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚。这是我们两党、两国青年、两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊又一个活生生的证明！
    在以伟大的共产主义战士恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟和阿尔巴尼亚广大革命青年，同全国广大劳动人民一起，在贯彻党的第五次代表大会规定的各项战斗任务中，获得了巨大的成就，我们红卫兵战士对这些成就表示最热烈的祝贺！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚青年，高高举起了反对美帝国主义的战斗旗帜，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义战争，坚决支持阿拉伯人民反抗美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略的正义斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，坚决支持世界各国人民的反帝革命斗争。你们不愧是反对帝国主义斗争中一支久经考验的坚强的突击队。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚青年，高高举起了马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，以鲜明的毫不含糊的原则立场，狠狠地打击了苏修叛徒集团、铁托叛徒集团以及形形色色的叛徒工贼们。你们不断揭露了苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团充当美帝国主义的帮凶、出卖苏联人民利益和各国人民革命的罪行。你们及时揭穿了苏修用骗子的手法修补他们的修正主义破车的卑鄙伎俩。你们无情地揭穿了勃列日涅夫、柯西金等一伙欧洲新工贼在卡罗维发利召开的反革命黑会的反动本质。你们批判了所谓“中间道路”的谬论。你们大力支持了欧洲和其他各国的无产阶级革命派，大力支持了左派青年组织反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争，你们为全世界革命青年树立了光辉的榜样！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚青年，有力地举起了思想文化革命的旗帜，向资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的意识形态进一步发动了进攻。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，你们加强了对青年的政治思想教育，大力开展了对马克思列宁主义理论的学习。你们同反动宗教势力展开激烈的斗争，横扫宗教迷信和千百年来毒害人们精神世界的落后习俗。你们痛击了歧视和压迫妇女的旧的封建习惯势力。你们批判了脱离群众、损害群众利益的官僚主义，实行了领导机关和基层干部的轮换制。你们提倡和发扬个人利益服从无产阶级整体利益的共产主义风格，降低了高工资，取消了许多额外报酬，缩小了自留地。你们在群众性的革命化运动中，进一步发扬了无产阶级专政下的民主。你们的一系列革命化的措施和群众中涌现出来的许多革命化的倡议，促进了无产阶级专政的巩固，促进了广大青年和广大人民的思想革命化，对于发展社会主义革命和防止资本主义复辟作出了宝贵的贡献。在阿尔巴尼亚人民中出现了亚当·雷卡这样舍己为公英勇牺牲的伟大的共产主义战士，就是思想革命化巨大威力的一个最好的说明。
    阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设，正在沿着劳动党第五次代表大会规定的路线胜利前进。阿尔巴尼亚人民在为完成第四个五年计划第一年的任务中，获得了显著的成就。工农业生产的情况很好。山区合作化已经胜利实现。阿尔巴尼亚广大革命青年干劲冲天，信心百倍地为实现第四个五年计划而献出自己的青春。许多地方开展了热火朝天的义务劳动。阿尔巴尼亚的土地上，到处是一片欣欣向荣的景象，社会主义建设正在出现一个新的高潮。
    阿尔巴尼亚青年，在建设社会主义和反对帝国主义、修正主义的伟大斗争中，获得了光辉的成绩。正如恩维尔·霍查同志所正确地评价的那样：阿尔巴尼亚“青年在为争取解放和进行社会主义建设的斗争中作出了巨大的贡献。青年将继承和推进我们的革命事业，建成社会主义社会，并为建设共产主义而奋斗，他们将继续和深入进行反对帝国主义、修正主义及反动派的斗争，将永远高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜。”
    同志们！我们中国红卫兵战士，对于兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚青年和人民所获得的这些成就，就象自己的成就一样感到十分高兴，十分鼓舞！
    毛主席说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”由于你们在国际国内阶级斗争和社会主义建设中所获得的新成就，这盏社会主义明灯更加明亮了。这些成就，归功于英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年，归功于光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，归功于伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志！
    同志们！史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，经过了一年轰轰烈烈的群众运动，已经取得了有历史意义的伟大胜利！革命和生产，都是一片大好形势。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正在推动社会主义建设出现新的飞跃。在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的新胜利！这是无产阶级文化大革命又一辉煌成果！这标志着我国科学技术、工业生产和国防力量提高到一个新的水平。这是对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义核垄断、核讹诈又一个沉重的打击！大长世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。现在，我国工业生产和农业生产，都出现了一片兴旺景象，工业产品在数量和质量上都大大超过去年同期的水平，今年农业夏收是一个令人兴奋的丰收，秋收也可能是一个丰收。
    在粉碎彭真、陆定一等反革命修正主义集团之后，埋藏在党内的最大的走资本主义道路当权派——赫鲁晓夫式的野心家，被我们红卫兵和全国广大人民揪出来了！那本背叛无产阶级专政、反对无产阶级革命、宣扬自私自利和奴才哲学的《论修养》，再也不能披着马列主义外衣去毒害青年和革命群众了！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是粉碎资本主义复辟的伟大胜利！这是巩固无产阶级专政的伟大胜利！
    我们党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。”
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级专政的学说，是马克思列宁主义革命理论的核心。在毛主席全面地继承、捍卫和发展马克思列宁主义的伟大创造中，一个最重要的内容，就是毛主席创造性地、划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，深刻地分析了社会主义社会中的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，阐明了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，制定了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的一系列的理论、方针和政策。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场无产阶级专政下的革命。这是一场在以毛主席为首的党中央领导下的、放手发动亿万群众的大革命。这场革命从批判思想文化领域中的资产阶级代表人物、代表作品入手，把党内的一批走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来。运动的目的是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟，运动的方法是实行无产阶级专政下的、毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主，开展大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，彻底贯彻群众路线，支持无产阶级革命派，尊重群众的首创精神，坚定不移地相信和依靠人民群众和干部的大多数。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，又一次证明了以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，是伟大、光荣、正确的党。我们的国家，是伟大的无产阶级专政的国家。国内外敌人的一切阴谋诡计，都只能遭到可耻的破产。
    美帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者，天天造出离奇古怪的谣言诬蔑和攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们最怕革命人民起来造他们的反，革他们的命。在中国几万万人民伟大的革命风暴面前，他们感觉到极大的恐怖，他们被中国人民在文化大革命中表现的伟大力量吓破了胆，感觉到自己也将被人民革命的怒涛所埋葬，就惊慌失措地大喊大叫起来，这正证明：中国无产阶级文化大革命，的的确确打中了他们最痛的地方！
    同志们！红卫兵就是这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的产物。红卫兵运动，就是适应无产阶级专政下革命而产生的崭新的革命青年的组织形式。红卫兵是无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。
    当红卫兵这个新事物刚刚在地平线上冒出来时，就受到我们伟大领袖毛主席的热烈支持和正确引导。毛主席亲自接见了全国一千几百万红卫兵。去年八月一日，毛主席给红卫兵的一封信，就是我们中国红卫兵的一个总纲领。
    毛主席说：红卫兵的革命行动，“说明对一切剥削压迫工人、农民、革命知识分子和革命党派的地主阶级、资产阶级、帝国主义、修正主义和他们的走狗，表示愤怒和申讨，说明对反动派造反有理，我向你们表示热烈支持。”
    毛主席又说：“我们支持你们，我们又要求你们注意争取团结一切可以团结的人们。对于犯了严重错误的人们，在指出他们的错误以后，也要给以工作和改正错误重新作人的出路。马克思说，无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。这个道理，也请同志们予以注意。”
    毛主席这封信，是对我们红卫兵最大的支持、最大的关怀、最大的鼓舞！是我们红卫兵的最高指示！
    毛主席这封信，深刻地说明了红卫兵运动的性质和任务，就是要造地主阶级、资产阶级、帝国主义、修正主义和他们走狗的反，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反，向他们猛烈进攻，同一切剥削阶级及其反动思想斗争到底。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者对我们红卫兵这样刻骨仇恨，就因为我们要造反到底，直到把他们这些害人虫全部消灭干净。
    毛主席这封信，指出了我们必须努力争取团结一切可以团结的人们。我们红卫兵遵循着毛主席的教导，在文化大革命中牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，以无产阶级革命派的团结为核心，努力团结广大青少年和广大群众，并且积极帮助犯了错误而不是屡教不改和坚持不改的人改正错误。我们红卫兵战士，边战斗，边学习，边整风，在游泳中学会游泳，在革命中学会革命，不断促进我们思想的无产阶级化，努力使自己成为共产主义事业的可靠接班人。
    同志们！毛主席是我们红卫兵的红司令，我们是毛主席的红小兵。我们对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜。毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。我们红卫兵的口号，就是林彪同志说的：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”目前，在革命的大批判中，一个空前巨大的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动正在我国兴起，一批批掌握了毛泽东思想的崭新的青年无产阶级革命战士，在斗争中成长起来了。
    我们中国的红卫兵，一时一刻也没有忘记自己国际主义的义务。我们坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾！我们坚决支持阿拉伯人民反抗美、英帝国主义及其走狗以色列的英勇斗争！我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国革命人民拿起武器推翻美帝国主义及其走狗反动统治的正义斗争！我们坚决支持同修正主义政党进行不调和斗争的左派革命组织！我们警告美帝国主义这只纸老虎：中国的红卫兵是中国人民解放军坚强的后备力量，我们已经做好充分准备，只要祖国一声令下，我们立刻奔赴战斗的前线，把以美国为首的帝国主义打得粉碎！
    苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团已经成为一个声名狼藉的破落户。他们残酷地镇压苏联人民，他们的内部分崩离析，他们的假面具再也遮不住反革命的狰狞面目了。他们挥舞的那面“联合行动”的破旗越来越不灵了。同他们在越南所干的一样，最近他们又一次赤裸裸地充当美帝国主义的帮凶，出卖阿拉伯人民利益，破坏阿拉伯人民反抗美英侵略的正义战争，使阿拉伯人民和全世界人民进一步看清了他们卑鄙的反革命叛徒面目。苏修同美帝，成了一对人人喊打的过街老鼠。我们要同阿尔巴尼亚同志一起，同全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民一起，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！我们相信，苏共修正主义叛徒集团，一定逃避不了苏联人民和全世界革命人民对他们的正义的审判！苏联革命青年和劳动人民，一定会起来造反，彻底推翻勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流所代表的资产阶级特权阶层的反动统治！十月革命的光辉旗帜，总有一天会在克里姆林宫的上空重新升起！
    亲爱的战友们！
    毛泽东同志说：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”
    恩维尔·霍查同志说：“我们十分珍视这种真正的人民之间的友谊。”“这是革命者之间的友谊，是为争取社会主义和共产主义神圣理想的胜利的战友之间的友谊，因此，它永垂不朽，万古长青，并将永远无往而不胜。”
    同志们！我们的斗争目标是一致的。我们的火热的心是紧紧连在一起的。我们革命的手是紧紧握在一起的。我们强大的革命友谊是任何力量也打不破的。在今后伟大革命斗争中，中国红卫兵一定遵照毛主席的教导，认真学习你们的无产阶级革命精神，永远同你们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会胜利成功！
    领导阿尔巴尼亚青年胜利前进的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其敬爱的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    毛泽东同志万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    中阿两国人民和青年的战斗友谊万岁！
    全世界革命人民和革命青年的大团结万岁！
