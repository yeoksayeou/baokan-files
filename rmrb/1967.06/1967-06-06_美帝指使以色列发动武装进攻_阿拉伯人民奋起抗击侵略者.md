The United Arab Republic's Armed Forces High Command issued a statement at noon on June 5th, stating that Israel launched a full-scale invasion of the UAR today, conducting large-scale air and ground attacks.

Israeli aircraft attacked numerous UAR airfields near the Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal area, as well as UAR air bases near Cairo. Sharm el-Sheikh in the Strait of Tiran was also bombed by Israeli planes. Additionally, Israeli forces launched a full-scale attack on the entire UAR border.

The statement announced that the UAR is resolutely repelling Israel's invasion and emphasized that Israel and those currently supporting Israel "will bear all the consequences that aggressors should bear."

Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, Israel today dispatched a large number of aircraft to bomb UAR air bases near Cairo and UAR airfields in the Suez Canal area, launching an armed invasion against the UAR.

According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio this morning, Israeli forces began air strikes on the UAR at 9 a.m. today.

The UAR military spokesman announced that UAR aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery fiercely attacked the invading Israeli planes. By 11 a.m., 42 enemy aircraft had been shot down.

On June 5th, while brazenly launching an invasion against the UAR, Israel also launched attacks on other surrounding Arab countries. The Arab peoples have unanimously risen up, joining the war to annihilate the U.S.-Israeli aggressors.

The UAR, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan, which had been on high alert, immediately launched powerful counterattacks after Israel initiated its assault.

The UAR's air force and anti-aircraft artillery bravely intercepted and shot down a large number of invading enemy planes, capturing a batch of Israeli pilots. In the Gaza Strip and the Sinai region, UAR armed forces and the Palestine Liberation Army are engaged in fierce battles with the invading Israeli forces.

Syrian air force intercepted Israeli planes that attacked Damascus International Airport in the morning of June 5th, shooting down some enemy planes. The Syrian air force subsequently took off, bombing Israeli airfields, military facilities, and troop assembly points in northern Israel, and bombing the oil depots in the port of Haifa. The Iraqi air force, which had recently entered Syria, also participated in the battle to punish Israel.

Syrian Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Atassi, announced on the radio, "Arab Syria has joined the battle." The Syrian Minister of Defense ordered all units of the Syrian People's Army to enter combat positions. Damascus Radio issued a broadcast calling on the military to "erase Israel from the map."

Jordan declared war on Israel after Israeli planes attacked the capital Amman on June 5th. It was announced that Jordanian forces had launched attacks along the Jordan-Israel border, shelling military strongholds within Israeli territory. In Jerusalem, which is jointly controlled by Jordan and Israel, Jordanian forces counterattacked Israeli advances, capturing a hill controlled by Israel, and advancing south into Israeli territory.

Lebanese forces sent reinforcements to the southern border near Israel on June 5th and shot down an invading Israeli plane.

Kuwait, which had previously sent support troops to the UAR, declared war on Israel on the same day after learning of the Israeli invasion.

Algerian support troops are speeding towards the UAR. More than 40 Algerian jet fighters are en route to the Middle East via Libya. The Libyan troops that have been departing for the UAR in the past two days will also soon arrive at the front to counterattack Israel.

Moroccan King Hassan ordered Moroccan armed forces to immediately march to the Middle East to fight against Israel. He inspected the departing troops.

Sudanese Prime Minister Mahgoub declared war on Israel on the same day and ordered the previously designated support troops to depart for the UAR immediately.

According to a broadcast by the Riyadh Radio, the Saudi Arabian Cabinet, after holding an emergency meeting on June 5th, announced that Saudi Arabian forces would participate in the battle against Israel.

At the same time, the capitals of various Arab countries presented a determined atmosphere to defeat the U.S.-Israeli aggression, with people mobilizing en masse. In addition to broadcasting frontline combat news, radios in the UAR, Syria, and other countries continuously broadcast patriotic battle songs and slogans, mobilizing the people to participate in the holy war against U.S.-Israeli aggression.
