Arab and African peoples, in their struggles against aggression, have come to recognize their friends and enemies. China is the true friend of the Arab people, while the Soviet revisionists are traitors to the Arab people's liberation cause.

	BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) — Faced with the wanton aggression of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, against Arab countries, more and more Arab and African peoples have come to realize that the great Chinese people are the most resolute in supporting the Arab people's struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression. At the same time, they have seen through the Soviet revisionist leadership's hypocritical support and actual betrayal of the Arab people's liberation cause.

	In the United Arab Republic (UAR), as Cairo Radio continuously broadcasted the Chinese government's statement issued on June 6, Premier Zhou Enlai's telegrams to UAR President Nasser and PLO Chairman Shukeiri, and the news of 300,000 people in Beijing holding a rally and demonstration in firm support of the Arab people's just struggle, the people of the UAR enthusiastically cheered, "Long live China!" and "Mao Zedong—China." A friend from the UAR said, "Today, we clearly see who our enemies are and who our friends are. The U.S., Britain, and Israel are our sworn enemies. The Soviet Union is our false friend and true traitor, as it stands on the side of imperialism and Zionism to exert political pressure on us and loudly advocate so-called 'peace' and 'ceasefire.' At this critical moment, China stands firmly on our side. China is our true friend."

	A UAR worker said, "In the past, we had hopes for the Soviet Union. Today, when the U.S., Britain, and Israel collude to attack us, the Soviet Union has given us no help. I have seen through its ugly face; it is our false friend."

	The General Secretary of the Palestine Trade Union Federation, Kuafash, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Cairo on June 7, "All Palestinians and other Arab people have come to realize that China is the best friend of the Arab people. The current war has taught us that we must rely on ourselves, not on those false friends." He said, "Although we are facing some difficulties today, we are even more angry with U.S. imperialism and Zionism, and we are more determined to make greater sacrifices for the final victory."

	In Sudan, in recent days, many Sudanese friends have visited the Chinese Embassy in Sudan and the Xinhua News Agency branch to express their gratitude for the Chinese government and people's resolute and sincere support for the Arab people's struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression. Some Sudanese friends, when talking about China's support, shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	Another Sudanese friend told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "Now, we Arab people place our hopes on our true friend, the Chinese people. We are more confident in our struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression because the seven hundred million revolutionary Chinese people stand on our side."

	Many Sudanese people condemn the Soviet revisionist group's stance on the Middle East issue as a clear betrayal of the Arab people. A Sudanese named Rofai told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "The Soviet revisionists are now colluding with U.S.-led imperialist forces, which is a good lesson for the people to see through the true nature of the Soviet revisionists." He emphasized, "We do not rely on the Soviet Union's false support; we mainly rely on our own strength, as well as the help of the People's Republic of China and other friendly countries in the world. We will definitely defeat our enemies, as Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.'"

	Upon hearing the news of U.S. and Soviet warships saluting each other in the Mediterranean, some Sudanese people angrily said, "Shameful! Shameful!"

	A Sudanese journalist pointed out: The Soviet revisionist leaders can no longer cover up their betrayal of the anti-imperialist cause. They have exposed themselves; they are false supporters and true betrayers of the Arab people and all the people of the world.

	The Chief Representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Cairo, Makoti, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as always and resolutely support the Arab people in their struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression. They are the true friends of all oppressed peoples in the world." He pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have once again shown through their actions that they are traitors to the Arab people's liberation cause.

    阿拉伯人民和非洲人民在反侵略斗争中认清了敌友
    中国是阿拉伯人民真正的朋友
    苏修是阿拉伯人民解放事业的背叛者
    新华社八日讯　面对美帝国主义及其工具以色列疯狂地向阿拉伯国家进行肆无忌惮的侵略的时候，越来越多的阿拉伯人民和非洲人民认识到伟大的中国人民是最坚决地支持阿拉伯人民反击美、以的侵略的斗争，同时更认清了苏联修正主义领导集团对于阿拉伯人民的解放事业的假支持、真出卖的丑恶面目。
    在阿联，当开罗电台不断广播中国政府六日发表的声明和周恩来总理给阿联总统纳赛尔和巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里的电报以及北京三十万人举行游行示威坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争的消息的时候，阿联人民纵情地欢呼“中国万岁！”、“毛泽东—中国”。一位阿联朋友说：“今天，我们清楚地看到，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。美英和以色列是我们的死敌。苏联是我们的假朋友，真叛徒，因为它站在帝国主义和犹太复国主义方面对我们施加政治压力，大肆叫嚷所谓‘和平’和‘停火’。在这个紧要时刻，中国坚定地站在我们一边，中国是我们真正的朋友。”
    一位阿联工人说：“过去，我们曾对苏联抱着希望，今天，当美、英、以色列互相勾结来打我们的时候，苏联却没有给我们任何帮助。我已看透了它的丑恶面目，它是我们的假朋友。”
    巴勒斯坦工会联合会总书记库法什七日对新华社驻开罗记者说：“所有巴勒斯坦人和其他阿拉伯人民认识到，中国是阿拉伯人民最好的朋友。当前的战争教育了我们，我们必须依靠我们自己，而不是那些假朋友。”他说：“虽然我们今天遇到了一些困难，但是我们对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义更加愤怒，更加增强了我们为争取最后胜利作出更大牺牲的决心。”
    在苏丹，这几天有许多苏丹朋友来到中国驻苏丹大使馆和新华社分社，表达他们感谢中国政府和人民对阿拉伯人民反击美、以侵略斗争的坚决和真诚的支持。有的苏丹朋友在谈到中国的支持时高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    另一位苏丹朋友对新华社记者说：“现在我们阿拉伯人民把我们的希望寄托在我们的真正的朋友中国人民身上。我们在反击美、以侵略的斗争中信心更足了，因为七亿革命的中国人民站在我们一边。”
    许多苏丹人民谴责苏修集团在中东问题上的立场是明显地出卖阿拉伯人民。一位名叫罗法伊的苏丹人对新华社记者说：“苏修正在同以美国为首的帝国主义势力狼狈为奸，这是一个很好的教训，使人民看清了苏修的本质。”他强调指出：“我们不依靠苏联的假支持，我们主要依靠自己的力量，同时也依靠中华人民共和国以及世界上其他一切友好国家的帮助。我们一定能打败我们的敌人，正如毛主席教导我们的那样：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”
    在听到美苏军舰在地中海互相致意的消息后，有些苏丹人民愤怒地说：“可耻！可耻！”
    一位苏丹新闻工作者指出：苏修领导人现在掩盖不了他们对反帝事业的背叛。他们已经自我暴露，他们对阿拉伯人民和全世界人民是假支持、真出卖。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻开罗首席代表马科蒂对新华社记者说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民一如既往地和坚决地支持阿拉伯人民反对美国和以色列的侵略，他们是全世界被压迫人民的真正朋友。”他指出，苏联修正主义者已经用他们自己的行动再次表明，他们是阿拉伯人民解放事业的背叛者。
