Israel, under the cover of a ceasefire resolution concocted by the US and the Soviet Union, has launched a furious assault on Syria. The Syrian military and civilians are bravely fighting back, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. Israeli invaders continue to attack Egyptian forces west of the Suez Canal and have bombed Cairo.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, Israel, under the guise of a United Nations ceasefire resolution orchestrated by the US and the Soviet Union, has feigned a ceasefire while continuing its aggressive actions. It has launched a large-scale offensive against Syria and continued its attacks and aerial bombings of the United Arab Republic. The Syrian and Egyptian military and civilians are putting up a fierce resistance, delivering a crushing blow to the invading enemy.

According to a military bulletin issued by Syria on the 10th, after the Syrian army put up a valiant defensive battle, Israeli forces advanced 15 kilometers into Syrian territory, reaching Quneitra.

The bulletin stated: "The Syrian army is fiercely fighting to defend every inch of our homeland. Units that have not yet entered the battle are now taking up their positions." It was announced that within Quneitra city and its suburbs, the Syrian army and people are still fighting side by side with all their might, and the enemy has not been able to control this city, which is 65 kilometers from the Syrian capital.

Israel's large-scale offensive against Syria began after Syria had already announced its acceptance of the United Nations ceasefire resolution on the 9th.

According to an official bulletin broadcast by the Damascus radio station, at 9:15 AM on the 9th, Israel brazenly launched an attack on Syrian frontline positions with a large number of tanks, artillery, aircraft, and infantry.

The Syrian army delivered a crushing blow to the enemy, annihilating the enemy's armored units that had advanced. On the northern front, the Syrian army destroyed an enemy armored unit, annihilating 13 tanks. On the central front, the Syrian army destroyed all enemy tanks attempting to break through Syrian lines.

That day, Israel dispatched hundreds of aircraft to launch fierce aerial attacks on Syrian military positions and cities. According to an announcement by the Syrian Embassy in France on the same day, American and British aircraft participated in the attacks on Syria.

According to a Syrian military bulletin, on the morning of the 10th, Israel again launched fierce attacks on Syrian frontline positions with aircraft, artillery, and tanks. The Syrian army launched a counterattack, repelling Israeli forces on the central and southern fronts. Enemy forces advanced from the northern front. The Syrian army bravely launched a counteroffensive, but Israeli forces deployed a large number of aircraft and tanks that only major powers could possess.

On the morning of the 10th, Israel continued to bomb Damascus. The Syrian army shot down four enemy aircraft.

On the Egyptian front, according to a bulletin issued by the Egyptian Armed Forces High Command at noon on the 9th, Egyptian forces completed their withdrawal to the west bank of the Suez Canal on the 8th. Despite Egypt's adherence to the United Nations ceasefire resolution, Israeli forces, with the support of imperialist troops, continued to attack Egyptian forces west of the Suez Canal. Aerial bombings of the Suez Canal area also continued. The bulletin stated that Egyptian forces are continuing to fulfill their sacred duty to defend their homeland.

Meanwhile, Israel continued to bomb Egyptian cities. According to the Egyptian representative to the United Nations, Israel bombed Cairo on the evening of the 9th and conducted at least eight aerial attacks on Ismailia from noon to 8 PM on the 9th. The Egyptian side shot down one Israeli aircraft.

    叙利亚军民英勇战斗痛击敌人
    以侵略军继续进攻苏伊士运河以西的阿联部队并空袭开罗
    据新华社十日讯　以色列在美苏合谋炮制的联合国“停火决议”的掩护下，假停火、真进攻，进一步向叙利亚发动大规模的进攻，并且继续进攻和空袭阿联。叙利亚和阿联军民英勇抵抗，给入侵的敌人以迎头痛击。
    据叙利亚十日发表的军事公报宣布，在叙利亚军队进行了英勇的防御战后，以色列军队侵入了距叙利亚—以色列边境十五公里的库奈特腊。
    公报宣布：“叙利亚军队正在为保卫祖国的每一寸土地而进行激烈的战斗。还没有投入战斗的部队已经进入阵地。”据宣布，在库奈特腊市内和近郊各地，叙利亚的军队和人民还在并肩进行全力的战斗，敌军仍然不能控制这个距叙利亚首都六十五公里的城市。
    以色列对叙利亚的大规模进攻，是在九日叙利亚已经宣布接受联合国的“停火决议”以后开始的。
    据大马士革电台广播的官方公报，九日上午九时十五分，以色列悍然出动大批坦克、大炮、飞机和步兵，向叙利亚前沿阵地发动了攻击。
    叙利亚军队给敌人以迎头痛击，把冲上来的敌军装甲部队全部消灭在阵地之前。在北部前线，叙利亚军队消灭了敌军的一支装甲部队，共击毁十三辆坦克。在中部前线，叙利亚军队又把企图突破叙军防线的敌军坦克全部击毁。
    这一天，以色列出动数百架飞机猛烈空袭叙利亚军队和城市。据叙利亚驻法国大使馆当天宣布，美国和英国的飞机参加了对叙利亚的袭击。
    据叙利亚军事公报说，十日上午，以色列又用飞机、大炮、坦克对叙利亚的前沿阵地进行猛烈的轰击。叙利亚军队发动反击，在中部和南部战线击退了以色列军队的进攻。敌军从北部战线侵入。叙利亚军队曾英勇地进行反攻，然而，以色列军队投入了大量“只有世界大国才可能有的”飞机和坦克。
    十日上午，以色列继续空袭大马士革，叙利亚军队击落来袭敌机四架。
    在阿联方面，据阿联武装部队最高司令部九日中午发表的公报，阿联武装部队在八日完成了撤退到苏伊士运河西岸的工作。尽管阿联遵守联合国的“停火决议”，以色列敌军在帝国主义部队的支持下仍然继续进攻苏伊士运河以西的阿联部队。对苏伊士运河区的空袭也在继续进行。公报说，阿联部队继续在执行他们保卫祖国的神圣职责。
    同时，以色列还在继续空袭阿联的城市。据阿联驻联合国代表通知安全理事会，以色列在九日晚轰炸了开罗，在九日中午到夜间八时对伊斯梅利亚至少空袭了八次。阿联方面击落以色列飞机一架。
