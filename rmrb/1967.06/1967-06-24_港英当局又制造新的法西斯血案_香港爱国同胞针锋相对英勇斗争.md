The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong today, in the afternoon and evening, once again dispatched a large number of armed police and "riot squads" to create a new fascist bloodbath in the Wanchai area of Kowloon. According to the British authorities themselves, one patriot was shot dead, and at least forty people were illegally arrested.

The new bloodbath took place at the Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union located in the heart of Kowloon, Wanchai. Around 3 PM today, the British authorities sent a large number of police and "riot squads" to surround the building of the union and the nearby streets. They tore down the anti-British big-character posters put up by the workers on the walls and threw tear gas at the crowds gathering nearby to protest, wildly provoking a confrontation. By 5 PM, the British authorities dispatched even more "riot squads" and threw a large amount of tear gas from nearby high-rise buildings at the union. They then stormed into the building and attacked the union office on the fourth floor, firing guns at the workers inside. The workers, enraged, fought back fiercely with cans, bottles, and other items, and the union building echoed with passionate slogans.

The British authorities' atrocities sparked immense anger among the nearby residents. By evening, more and more people gathered in the streets to protest. Despite the British authorities' brutal suppression, they burned one of the British authorities' cars near the old Wanchai police station. The patriots also piled up garbage bins in the middle of the nearby streets to block the "riot vehicles."

As of 11 PM tonight, the southern and northern regions of Wanchai, Kowloon, are still under a state of white terror.

    港英当局又制造新的法西斯血案  香港爱国同胞针锋相对英勇斗争
    新华社香港二十三日电港英法西斯当局今天下午和晚上，再次出动大批武装警察和“防暴队”，在九龙旺角地区制造了新的法西斯血案。仅据港英当局自己宣布，我爱国同胞有一人被枪杀，至少有四十人被非法逮捕。
    新的血案发生在位于九龙的中心地带旺角的树胶塑胶业总工会。今天下午三时许，港英当局出动大批警察和“防暴队”，包围这家工会的楼房和附近街道，撕毁工人贴在墙上的反英大字报，并向附近地区前来抗议的群众施放催泪弹，疯狂地进行挑衅。到下午五时以后，港英当局又增派大批“防暴队”，并从附近高楼上向这家工会施放大量催泪弹，随后又冲进屋内向设在四楼的工会会址冲击，并悍然开枪向工会屋内的工人射击。工人们愤怒异常，用铁罐、瓶子等物坚决进行自卫还击，工会内传出激昂的口号声。
    港英当局的暴行激起了附近群众的极大愤怒。到晚间，附近街道上前来抗议的群众越来越多。他们不顾港英当局的疯狂镇压，在旧旺角港英警署附近愤怒地烧毁了港英当局的一部汽车。爱国同胞还把垃圾桶堆放在附近街道的街心，阻止“防暴车”开行。
    至今晚十一时，九龙旺角道南北地区还处在白色恐怖中。
