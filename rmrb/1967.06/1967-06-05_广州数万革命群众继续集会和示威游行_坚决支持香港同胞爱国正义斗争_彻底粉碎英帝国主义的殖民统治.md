Guangzhou's tens of thousands of revolutionary masses continued to hold meetings and demonstrate. They resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of Hong Kong compatriots and thoroughly smash the colonial rule of British imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 4th - Revolutionary masses in the Guangzhou region continued to hold rallies and demonstrations, strongly denouncing the crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in suppressing Hong Kong compatriots.

On the evening of the 3rd, tens of thousands of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres from the Guangzhou region gathered at the Yuexiu Mountain People's Stadium for a meeting. A significant portion of the participants were representatives of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants from the suburbs of Guangzhou. The meeting emphasized that the fate of Hong Kong depends on the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and the great seven hundred million Chinese people, and not on the corrupt and decaying British imperialism. The escalation of the atrocities by the Hong Kong British authorities means that the anti-British struggle must also escalate. We are determined, together with the people of the entire country, to be the steadfast backbone of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. We resolutely support the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong in taking all possible actions politically, economically, and culturally to launch a powerful counterattack against the colonial rule of British imperialism, to fight and defeat British imperialism!

During the meeting, slogans echoed through the night sky of Yuexiu Mountain. The meeting's host strongly condemned the various persecutions of the Hong Kong British authorities against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and warmly praised the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong for their unyielding, fearless, and heroic struggle against British imperialism. He said that in Hong Kong, a large-scale anti-imperialist mass movement is developing rapidly. Hong Kong compatriots are further mobilizing and organizing, ready at any time to respond to the call of the great motherland, to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism. We are confident that the final victory will belong to the four million patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the great seven hundred million Chinese people.

An old worker who participated in the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike said at the meeting, "The brave and tenacious Chinese working class and people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have long since confronted British imperialism. In the world-renowned Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike, we confronted them for sixteen months, ultimately achieving our victory and their defeat. Today, British imperialism, in cahoots with American imperialism, is once again committing atrocities against the Chinese people in Hong Kong, bloodily suppressing Chinese workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The result will inevitably be 'lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' failing even more miserably than before."

A representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants from the suburbs of Guangzhou said at the meeting, "The British government and the Hong Kong British authorities, following the lead of American imperialism, dare to oppose the great Chinese people. Recently, they have sent multiple warships to Hong Kong to provoke, to which we express our strongest protest! We warn British imperialism that the era of your rampant behavior on Chinese soil has passed and will not return."

Red Guards at the meeting said, "The persecution of British imperialism against patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong is a provocation against our seven hundred million Chinese people. We will not stand idly by. We resolutely stand together with the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, fight together, and win together!"

Revolutionary workers, cadres, and representatives from the news media also spoke at the meeting. They pointed out: For more than a hundred years, British imperialism has done nothing but evil in Hong Kong, with blood debts piled high and sins beyond measure, which must be thoroughly settled. Now, British imperialism continues to wreak havoc in Hong Kong, committing bloody persecutions against our patriotic compatriots. We, the seven hundred million Chinese people, absolutely cannot tolerate this!

The meeting concluded with a telegram angrily denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and extending the warmest greetings to the heroic struggling patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong.

After the meeting, a grand demonstration was held.

    广州数万革命群众继续集会和示威游行
    坚决支持香港同胞爱国正义斗争
    彻底粉碎英帝国主义的殖民统治
    新华社广州四日电　广州地区革命群众继续举行大会和示威游行，愤怒声讨港英当局镇压香港同胞的罪行。
    三日晚，广州地区又有数万革命工人、贫下中农、革命师生和革命干部在越秀山人民体育场举行集会。参加集会的很大一部分是来自广州郊区的广大贫下中农的代表。大会强调指出，香港的命运取决于香港爱国同胞，取决于伟大的七亿中国人民，而决不取决于腐败衰朽的英帝国主义。港英当局的暴行“升级”，抗英斗争也就要“升级”。我们决心和全国人民一道，誓作香港爱国同胞的坚强后盾，坚决支持香港爱国同胞从政治上、经济上和文化上采取一切可能的行动，向英帝国主义的殖民统治发动强大的反击，把英帝国主义斗垮，斗臭！
    大会进行中，口号声震撼着越秀山的夜空。大会主持人在讲话中强烈谴责港英当局对我香港爱国同胞的种种迫害，热烈赞扬香港爱国同胞前赴后继，不怕牺牲，同英帝国主义进行了英勇的斗争。他说，在香港，一场大规模的反帝群众运动正在猛烈发展中，香港同胞正在进一步动员起来，组织起来，随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，粉碎英帝国主义的反动统治。我们深信，最后的胜利一定属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港四百万爱国同胞和伟大的七亿中国人民。
    曾参加省港大罢工的一位老工人在会上说，英勇顽强的中国工人阶级和中国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，早就同英帝国主义较量过。在世界闻名的省港大罢工中，我们就和他们较量了十六个月，最后以我们的胜利，以英帝国主义的失败而告终。今天英帝国主义又同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，勾结在一起，干着反对中国人民的勾当，又一次血腥镇压香港中国工人和香港爱国同胞，其结果必然是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，比过去失败得更惨。
    广州郊区贫下中农的代表在会上说，英国政府和港英当局追随美帝国主义，竟敢与伟大的中国人民为敌，最近又派遣多艘军舰开往香港进行挑衅，我们表示最强烈的抗议！我们要警告英帝国主义，你们在中国土地上横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。
    红卫兵小将在会上说，英帝国主义对香港爱国同胞的迫害，就是对我们七亿中国人民的挑衅，我们决不会坐视不管，我们坚决和香港爱国同胞团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    革命工人、干部和新闻界代表也在会上讲话，他们指出：一百多年来，英帝国主义在香港干尽了坏事，血债累累，罪恶滔天，必须彻底清算。现在，英帝国主义继续在香港胡作非为，对我爱国同胞进行血腥迫害，我们七亿中国人民绝对不能容许！
    大会最后通电愤怒声讨港英当局的法西斯暴行，同时向英勇斗争的香港爱国同胞致以最亲切的慰问。
    大会结束后，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
