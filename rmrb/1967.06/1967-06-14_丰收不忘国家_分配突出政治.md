The commune of Juejiao in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, has been using Chairman Mao Zedong's thought as the guiding principle, using the revolutionary critique as the driving force, and focusing on breaking private interests and establishing public interests. This has promoted the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and advanced the work of the summer harvest.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on the 13th, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the fourth brigade in Juejiao Commune, Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, have been using Chairman Mao Zedong's thought as the guiding principle in the summer distribution, using revolutionary critique as the driving force, focusing on breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and mobilizing the masses to democratically formulate plans. This has effectively promoted the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking and advanced the work of summer harvesting, summer sowing, and summer management. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have decided to continue their efforts and strive for an even greater autumn harvest to make greater contributions to the state.

This brigade's summer crops this year have achieved a bumper harvest, with the total yield increasing by about 20% compared to last year. When discussing the summer distribution, someone said, "This year we have a good harvest, and there is a material foundation, so what's the problem with doing a good job in the summer distribution?" Someone else said, "Summer distribution is just about clearing up work points, formulating plans, and distributing grain and fodder, there's not much 'big deal' to it." The brigade production leadership group and representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants believed that these thoughts actually reflect a focus on material gains without considering people, treating the distribution work as a purely administrative task. If this approach is taken, it would be impossible to promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking and truly do a good job in the summer distribution. Therefore, the brigade production leadership group organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and raised the question of how the distribution work should be done this year, encouraging everyone to discuss. Through study and discussion, everyone realized that distribution work is a struggle to break private interests and establish public interests, a very important political task. Many production team cadres said, "This year's summer distribution should be a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, should be driven by revolutionary critique, and should be treated as a political task to promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking." "This year's summer harvest is only a material harvest, and we must use the distribution to further promote a harvest of thoughts."

In the summer distribution work, they focused on revolutionary critique, launching attacks on the reactionary fallacies such as the "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," and "material incentives" advocated by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, exposing the poison left by the bourgeois reactionary line in the distribution work; studying Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, recalling the history of revolutionary struggles, village history, and family history, focusing on the fundamental issue of power to conduct class education and raise class consciousness; focusing on the central issue of correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual in the distribution, conducting education for revolutionary farming, and establishing the idea of putting the public first. After denouncing the reactionaries for killing his family members and recounting his own miserable experiences in the old society, poor peasant community member Gao Jiansheng said excitedly, "The top capitalist-roader within the Party advocates 'three selfs and one package' and 'material incentives,' which is to make us forget the class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempt to restore capitalism in China. We will never agree to this!" Poor peasant Tang Haozhen from the first production team said, "The top capitalist-roader within the Party is speaking for the landlords and rich peasants. We cannot just focus on our own interests, cannot just focus on getting more money and more grain, we must make achievements for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, must discard private interests and replace them with red hearts, and ensure that the proletarian state will never change color."

In this year's summer distribution, this brigade criticized the past practice of closed-door accounting and decision-making by a few people, insisting on "from the masses, to the masses," handing over policies to the masses, and discussing all major issues with the masses. At the beginning, some cadres had a sense of difficulty, fearing that opening up the issues would not be resolved, fearing that the issues would be brought to their own heads, advocating that the production team accountants be gathered to formulate plans and then announced to the masses. Some people in the masses also thought that distribution was the accountant's job, and they only needed to focus on production. The brigade production leadership group organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works to solve the ideological problems. Through study, everyone realized that "the masses are the real heroes," "the people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history." Community member Gao Jinlian said, "In the past, distribution was decided by the team leader's words and the accountant's actions, with a few people making the decisions; this year we democratically handle the distribution, which is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can we do a good job in the distribution." After unifying thoughts, this brigade, with the production team as the unit, democratically elected a distribution group to be responsible for the distribution work. They insisted on having the masses discuss policies and formulate plans, with cadres fully listening to the masses' opinions, announcing the accounts to the masses, and letting the masses review them. In the process of discussing the distribution plan, everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on "comprehensive planning," "considering the overall situation," and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," held meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further established the overall perspective, and correctly handled the relationship between the three parties. The entire brigade sold an additional 6,400 pounds of grain in the summer, increased the reserve grain by more than 20,000 pounds, and appropriately raised the community members' grain ration, achieving the goal of not forgetting the state in a bumper harvest, not forgetting the lean years, and having reserves. Economic distribution, in addition to leaving enough production funds, also allowed community members to receive a portion of the cash.

Due to emphasizing politics in the distribution, the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking has been greatly strengthened, and the summer harvesting work has been greatly advanced.

    丰收不忘国家  分配突出政治
    江苏如东掘郊公社四大队坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，以大批判为动力，大抓破私立公教育，促进了人的思想革命化，正确处理了国家集体社员三者关系，推动了三夏工作
    据新华社南京十三日电　江苏省如东县掘郊公社四大队贫下中农和革命干部，在夏季预分中坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，以革命的大批判为动力，大抓破私立公教育，放手发动群众，民主制订方案，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，推动了夏收、夏种、夏管工作。广大贫下中农和革命干部决心再接再厉，争取秋熟更大丰收，为国家作出更大贡献。
    这个大队今年夏熟作物获得大丰收，总产量比去年增产二成左右。在开始讨论夏季预分的时候，有人说：“今年丰收了，有了物质基础，做好夏季分配工作还有啥问题！”有人说：“夏季预分不过是清清工分，订订方案，分分粮草，没有多少大‘文章’好做。”大队生产领导组和贫下中农代表认为，这些思想实际上是见物不见人，把分配工作看成是单纯的业务工作。如果这样做，就不可能促进人的思想革命化，不可能真正搞好夏季预分。于是，大队生产领导组组织大家学习毛主席的“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，提出了今年分配工作到底应该怎么做的问题，发动大家讨论。通过学习、讨论，大家认识到，分配工作是一场破私立公的阶级斗争，是一项十分重要的政治工作。许多生产队干部说：“今年夏季预分应该是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，应该以革命的大批判为动力，应该把分配工作作为促进人的思想革命化的政治工作来抓。”“今年夏熟丰收只是物质上的丰收，我们必须通过分配，进一步促进思想上的丰收。”
    他们在夏季预分工作中，狠抓革命的大批判，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“物质刺激”等反动谬论开火，揭露资产阶级反动路线在分配工作上所造成的流毒；学习毛主席有关教导，回忆革命斗争史、村史、家史，抓住政权这个根本问题进行阶级教育，提高阶级觉悟；抓住正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系这个分配的中心问题，进行为革命种田的教育，树立公字当头的思想。第五生产队贫农社员高建生在控诉反动派杀害自己亲人和亲身在旧社会的悲惨遭遇后，激动地说：“党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派提倡‘三自一包’、‘物质刺激’，就是要我们忘记阶级，忘记无产阶级专政，妄想在中国复辟资本主义，我们坚决不答应！”第一生产队贫农唐浩珍说：“党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是替地主富农说话的。我们搞分配不能光顾自己鼻子底下的一点利益，不能只顾多分钱、多分粮，要为中国革命和世界革命做出成绩，要丢掉私心换红心，保证无产阶级江山永不变色。”
    这个大队在今年夏季预分中，批判了过去那种关门算账、少数人包办的错误做法，坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”，把政策交给群众，一切大事都经过群众讨论。开始，有的干部有畏难情绪，怕把问题摊开来收不了场，怕把问题弄到自己头上，主张把生产队会计集中起来制订方案，然后向群众公布一下。群众中也有人认为，搞分配是会计的事，我们只管生产。大队生产领导小组组织大家学习毛主席著作，解决思想问题。通过学习，大家认识到：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”社员高金连说：“过去分配是队长动嘴，会计动手，少数人说了算；今年我们民主搞分配，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有贯彻毛主席的革命路线，才能搞好分配。”思想统一以后，这个大队就以生产队为单位，民主产生了分配小组，具体负责分配工作。他们坚持由群众讨论政策，制订方案，干部充分听取群众意见，向群众公布账目，让群众审查。在讨论分配方案的过程中，大家重温毛主席的“统筹兼顾”、“顾全大局”、“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，开学习毛主席著作讲用会，进一步树立了全局观点，正确处理了三者关系。全大队夏季多卖粮食六千四百斤，增加储备粮二万多斤，社员口粮水平也适当提高，做到了丰收不忘国家，不忘歉收，留有后备。经济分配除留足生产资金外，社员也分到一部分现金。
    由于突出政治搞分配，大大加强了人的思想革命化，大大推动了夏收生产工作。
