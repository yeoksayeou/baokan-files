Recently, according to the decision of the Party Central Committee, the "May 16 Circular" of 1966, personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, was publicly issued. Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was reissued, and Mao's five combative documents on literary and artistic issues were publicly issued. Additionally, "Comrade Lin Biao's Letter to the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission," the "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Cultural Work Convened by Comrade Jiang Qing on Behalf of Comrade Lin Biao," and the editorials from "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily" editorial department, "The Crux of 'Cultivation' is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "A Great Historical Document," among others, were also published. This series of extremely important documents and articles, especially the "May 16 Circular" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, systematically summarizes the historical experience of the international communist movement and our country's socialist revolution. It profoundly elucidates the theory, line, policy, and principles of conducting a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. It shines with the invincible brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The publication of this series of extremely important documents and articles is to guide the revolutionary masses to further grasp Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon, firmly grasp the overall direction of the struggle, push the great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to a new high, and better achieve the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and successfully complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in this region and unit.

"The most important thing is to be good at learning." All revolutionary comrades, especially the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary cadres, must seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement the extremely important documents and articles decided to be published by the Party Central Committee.

Lenin said, "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Marxists have always attached great importance to the role of revolutionary theory. Once theory is grasped by the masses, it becomes an infinite material force. The great mass movement of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is precisely because the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong have been grasped by hundreds of millions of people, that it can be so magnificent, shaking the earth, and so irresistible. It can be believed that the broad proletarian revolutionary forces, through serious study of the series of great works and instructions by Chairman Mao recently published, summing up the experience of the past year's struggle, further arming themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, rectifying their thoughts, styles, and ranks, will definitely make our direction clearer, our vision sharper, our goals more unified, and our steps more coordinated, raising our level of struggle to a new height.

"What are the characteristics of the current movement? What are its laws? How to guide this movement? These are practical problems." "To study the overall situation and development of this movement is a major topic that we must always pay attention to. If someone refuses to conduct a serious and detailed study of these issues, then he is not a Marxist." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong puts forward to us the most important and fundamental issue of correctly analyzing the situation, studying the laws of the movement, and grasping the direction of the struggle. This is a major issue that every self-aware proletarian revolutionary must always pay attention to.

Chairman Mao tells us that the main target of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Exposing this handful of people, thoroughly criticizing the entire set of revisionist goods they peddle, making them stink, overthrowing them, and carrying out the struggle for power, this is the main problem that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat aims to solve.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation of class struggle, we can grasp the main contradiction in society and correctly grasp the direction of the struggle, and we can be invincible. On the contrary, if someone does not see that the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a serious political struggle, if they do not truly grasp the proletarian worldview but instead use the bourgeois worldview to observe problems, they will deviate from the revolutionary direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and go astray.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must learn. Even for those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism and have a relatively firm proletarian stance, they still need to learn, to accept new things, to study new problems." If we do not seriously study Chairman Mao's great works and instructions, do not seriously study the policies and principles of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, think we are the "only correct" ones, the "only revolutionary" ones, and live off our "old capital," but in reality, our minds are still filled with the old ways, and deep in our souls, there are still many bourgeois filth, then our thoughts will fall behind, we will fall behind, and we may even become obstacles to the continued advancement of the revolution. If we take a bourgeois pragmatist attitude towards these important documents and articles, picking and choosing what we need, and using a sentence or two from the documents to attack our comrades, that is also very wrong.

To learn, one must learn sincerely and seriously. Chairman Mao teaches us, "In the world, the most feared words are 'seriousness,' and the Communist Party is the most serious." One must be able to sit down and read deeply, repeatedly and thoroughly studying. Read each article three, five, seven, or eight times, linking it to reality, thinking deeply, and studying in depth, mastering some basic viewpoints, and memorizing some aphorisms, to truly gain something. Otherwise, if one merely skims through it like a dragonfly skimming the water, one will gain nothing.

We must deeply understand the decision of the Party Central Committee to publish this series of documents and articles.

The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a serious class struggle, and only by deeply understanding the theory, line, policy, and principles proposed by Chairman Mao can we increase revolutionary consciousness and eliminate blindness.

Deep understanding means using the line, policy, and principles of the Party Central Committee embodied in these documents and articles to arm our minds. Some comrades, relying solely on enthusiasm, use their feelings to replace policies, and end up falling. We should take this as a lesson.

Studying these documents and articles, we must resolutely implement them. If we learn but do not use, then learning for a hundred years will still be of no use.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work, and it is also the guiding principle for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The series of extremely important documents and articles recently published embody the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. All revolutionary comrades must follow closely and quickly, implement them comprehensively and resolutely, without any discounts.

    认真学习　深刻领会　坚决照办

    最近，根据党中央的决定，公开发表了由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，重新发表了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，公开发表了毛主席关于文学艺术问题的五个战斗性文件，《林彪同志给中央军委常委的信》、《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，以及《红旗》杂志《人民日报》编辑部文章《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》、《伟大的历史文件》等等。这一系列极其重要的文件和文章，特别是中共中央《通知》，系统地总结了国际共产主义运动和我国社会主义革命的历史经验，深刻地阐明了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论、路线、方针、政策，闪耀着战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大光辉。
    发表这一系列极其重要的文件和文章，是要引导革命群众进一步掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大、最锐利的思想武器，牢牢地把握住斗争的大方向，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，推向一个新高潮，更好地实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，胜利地完成本地区、本单位的斗批改任务。
    “重要的问题在善于学习”。一切革命同志，特别是革命群众组织的负责人和革命干部，对待党中央决定发表的这些极其重要的文件和文章，一定要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    列宁说过：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”马克思主义者从来就高度重视革命理论的作用。理论一旦为群众所掌握，就变成无穷的物质力量。无产阶级文化大革命这个伟大的群众运动，正是因为毛泽东同志所提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策被亿万群众所掌握，才能这样轰轰烈烈，震动大地，才能这样势如破竹，锐不可挡。可以相信，广大的无产阶级革命派通过认真学习最近发表的毛主席的一系列伟大著作和指示，总结一年来的斗争经验，进一步用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来，整顿思想、整顿作风、整顿队伍，就一定能使我们的方向更加明确，眼光更加锐利，目标更加一致，步伐更加整齐，把我们的斗争水平提到一个新的高度。
    “当前的运动的特点是什么？它有什么规律性？如何指导这个运动？这些都是实际的问题。”“研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。如果有人拒绝对于这些作认真的过细的研究，那么他就不是一个马克思主义者。”毛泽东同志在这里，向我们提出了正确分析形势，研究运动规律，掌握斗争方向这样一个最重要、最根本的问题。这是每一个自觉的无产阶级革命战士需要时刻注意的大问题。
    毛主席告诉我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。揭露这一小撮人，彻底批判他们所贩卖的一整套修正主义货色，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，对他们进行夺权斗争，这就是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要问题。
    用毛泽东思想去分析阶级斗争的形势，我们就能够抓住社会的主要矛盾，正确地掌握斗争方向，我们就能够无往而不胜。相反，如果有的人看不到无产阶级同资产阶级之间的阶级斗争是严肃的政治斗争，如果不真正地掌握无产阶级世界观，而是用资产阶级世界观去观察问题，那就会离开毛主席所指出的革命的大方向，就会走到邪路上去。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。即使是对于马克思主义已经了解得比较多的人，无产阶级立场比较坚定的人，也还是要再学习，要接受新事物，要研究新问题。”如果不认真学习毛主席的伟大著作和指示，不认真学习以毛主席为代表的党中央的方针、政策，自以为“唯一正确”，“唯我革命”，凭“老本”吃饭，而实际上脑袋里还是过去的那一套，灵魂深处还保留着不少资产阶级的脏东西，那么，我们的思想就会落后，就会掉队，甚至有可能成为革命继续前进的障碍。如果是用资产阶级的实用主义的态度，对这些重要文件和文章各取所需，片面地抓住文件的这一句，或那一句，用来攻击自己的同志，那也是很错误的。
    学，必须老老实实地学，认认真真地学。毛主席教导我们：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲认真。”要坐得下，读得进，反复地、深入地学习。每一篇读它个三遍五遍、七遍八遍，联系实际，认真思考，深入研究，把一些基本观点学懂学透，把一些警句背下来，才能真正有所收获。否则，肤皮了草，蜻蜓点水式地浏览一遍，就会一无所得。
    对党中央决定发表这一系列文件和文章，必须深刻领会。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场严肃的阶级斗争，只有深刻领会毛主席提出的理论、路线、方针和政策，才能提高革命的自觉性，去掉盲目性。
    深刻领会，也就是要用这些文件和文章中体现的党中央的路线、方针、政策来武装我们的头脑。有些同志，单凭热情办事，用感想代替政策，结果摔了跤。我们应当引以为戒。
    学习这些文件和文章，必须坚决照办。如果学了不用，那么，学一百年也还是无益的。
    毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针，也是无产阶级文化大革命的指导方针。最近发表的一系列极其重要的文件和文章，体现了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。一切革命同志要跟得紧，跟得快，贯彻得全面、坚决，不能打折扣。
