Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots, fight bravely for a great victory!
The people of the motherland resolutely support you in resisting the British and fighting to the end!

Revolutionary masses from all over the country have pointed out: The U.S. imperialists are nothing but paper tigers, and the British imperialists are no more than paper tigers as well. If the British imperialists dare to continue their rampant behavior in Hong Kong, they will surely be smashed to pieces in front of the 700 million Chinese people.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated June 3, the British imperialists, regardless of repeated warnings from the Chinese government, have recently become even more arrogant and outrageous in their provocations against the 4 million compatriots in Hong Kong, sparking great indignation among the Chinese people. The masses from all over the country have expressed their firm support for the editorial "Resolutely Counter the British Imperialists' Provocations" published in the People's Daily. They believe that this is the voice of the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a powerful support for the patriotic struggle currently unfolding in Hong Kong. People have expressed their determination to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong and to shatter this dark hell of colonial rule. The people of the entire country have resolved to support the patriots in Hong Kong in their fight to the end.

Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and Red Guards in Beijing have unanimously expressed their determination to firmly uphold the banner of "Revolution is justified, rebellion is justified" and support the patriots in Hong Kong in their struggle against the British imperialists. Workers from the Beijing Coke Chemical Plant's Red Rebel Brigade said that for many years, this decayed and barbaric imperialist Britain has followed the world's number one public enemy—the U.S. imperialists—and opposed the 4 million compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people. Now, the patriots in Hong Kong have awakened and risen up to rebel against British imperialism! They hold up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a magnificent wave of revolutionary indignation against the British imperialists' bloody suppression. The working class of the motherland resolutely supports the patriots in Hong Kong in their just struggle and will be their steadfast rear guard.

The Red Guards of the Chinese Medical University and the Red Flag Commune in the capital, after studying the editorial "Resolutely Counter the British Imperialists' Provocations" published in the People's Daily, indignantly said that the Chinese people will never forget their old and new grievances against British imperialism, and the blood debts they owe must be settled. We Chinese Red Guards have grown up under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely uphold the banner of "Revolution is justified, rebellion is justified," despise all monsters and demons, despise imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and together with the 700 million people of the entire country, vow to be the steadfast rear guard of the patriotic students and compatriots in Hong Kong. We will rebel against British imperialism and create a bright red new world in Hong Kong!

Today, revolutionary masses from various sectors in Guangzhou held meetings to condemn the heinous crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in suppressing the patriots in Hong Kong and to firmly support the editorial "Resolutely Counter the British Imperialists' Provocations" published in the People's Daily. They emphasized that the editorial has sounded the mobilization order for the anti-British and anti-violence struggle. The 700 million Chinese people will definitely fight shoulder to shoulder with the patriots in Hong Kong and carry the anti-British and anti-violence struggle to the end. Many revolutionary workers at the meetings warned the Hong Kong British authorities: Your few batons, a few "orders," and a few broken warships cannot intimidate the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The Hong Kong working class and people from all walks of life, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, once dealt a heavy blow to British imperialism during the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike. Now, with the support of the 700 million people of the motherland and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the compatriots in Hong Kong will definitely launch an even larger-scale anti-British and anti-violence struggle. We Guangzhou workers vow to be the strong rear guard of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.

The Red Guards of the universities and colleges in Guangzhou said that British imperialism has done countless evil deeds in Hong Kong, with blood debts and heinous crimes piled up, which must be settled. We will definitely retaliate tooth for tooth and resolutely counter their provocations. We Red Guards are ready at any time to respond to the call of our great motherland and, together with the patriots in Hong Kong, thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

In Shanghai, which has a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction, revolutionary masses, and Red Guards indignantly said: The British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government, have escalated their suppression and persecution of our patriotic compatriots, attempting to extinguish the great anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle that has been ignited in Hong Kong. They are madly escalating the persecution. We Shanghai revolutionary people firmly support the editorial published in the People's Daily today and resolutely stand with the compatriots in Hong Kong to demand blood debt from British imperialism. Workers of the First Steel Plant of Shanghai said: British imperialism brutally persecutes our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, which is a serious provocation to our great 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. We Shanghai workers will definitely fully support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong in their struggle against persecution. Revolutionary young soldiers of the Dongfanghong Brigade of Tongji University said: The U.S. imperialists are nothing but paper tigers, and the British imperialists are no more than paper tigers as well. If the British imperialists dare to continue their rampant behavior in Hong Kong, they will surely be smashed to pieces in front of the 700 million Chinese people.

The Red Guards of Lu Xun University in Shandong Province, who are currently supporting the summer harvest, listened to the broadcast today with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said that British imperialism has not settled the old accounts it owes us, and now it is persecuting our patriotic compatriots, which is too much. The Red Guards said: We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, we are the reserve army of the People's Liberation Army of China. Domestic class enemies, we Red Guards will fight and overthrow them; international imperialism and revisionism, we Red Guards will also fight and overthrow them. Whether it is domestic counter-revolutionary revisionists or international imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, they can only be smashed to pieces in front of the great Chinese people and will have no good end.

    港九爱国同胞们，为争取伟大的胜利英勇战斗吧！
    祖国人民坚决支持你们反英抗暴到底
    各地革命群众纷纷指出：美帝是一只纸老虎，英帝也不过是一只纸老虎。英帝胆敢在香港继续胡作非为，必将在七亿中国人民面前碰得粉身碎骨
    据新华社三日讯　英帝国主义不顾我国政府的一再警告，最近变本加厉地极其嚣张、极其猖狂地向四百万香港同胞挑衅，激起了我国人民极大的愤怒。各地群众表示坚决拥护《人民日报》《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》的社论。他们认为，这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大中国人民战斗的声音，是对香港同胞正在展开的如火如荼的反迫害斗争一个强大的声援。人们表示，为粉碎英帝国主义在香港的反动统治，为砸烂这个英国殖民统治的黑暗地狱，全国人民下定决心，一定要支持香港同胞战斗到底。
    北京广大革命工人、革命农民、革命师生和红卫兵小将一致表示，一定要高举“革命无罪，造反有理”的大旗，支持香港同胞大造香港万恶的殖民统治者英帝国主义的反。北京炼焦化学厂职工红色造反团的战士们说，多少年来，英国这个腐朽、野蛮的帝国主义，一直追随世界人民的头号公敌——美帝国主义，同我香港四百万中国同胞为敌，同七亿中国人民为敌。现在，香港爱国同胞觉醒了，起来大造英帝国主义的反了！他们捧起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起了波澜壮阔的反对英帝国主义血腥镇压的革命怒潮。祖国的工人阶级坚决支持香港同胞的正义斗争，坚决做他们的坚强后盾。
    首都大专院校红代会中国医科大学红卫兵、红旗公社的全体战士，今天学习了《人民日报》社论《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》以后愤慨地说，中国人民对英帝国主义的新仇旧恨永远不能忘，他们欠下的笔笔血债一定要清算。我们中国红卫兵是在伟大领袖毛主席的教导下成长起来的，我们一定高举“革命无罪，造反有理”的大旗，藐视一切牛鬼蛇神，藐视帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，和全国七亿人民一道，誓做香港爱国学生和爱国同胞的坚强后盾，大造英帝国主义的反，在香港闯出一个红彤彤的新天地！
    今天，广州市各界革命群众纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨港英当局镇压香港爱国同胞的滔天罪行，最坚决支持《人民日报》发表的《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》的社论。他们强调指出，《人民日报》的社论吹响了反英抗暴斗争的动员令，七亿中国人民一定同香港爱国同胞并肩战斗，把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。许多革命工人在集会上愤怒地警告港英当局：你们的几根警棍，几道“法令”，几条破军舰，是吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民的。有着反帝斗争光荣传统的香港工人阶级和各界群众，过去在省港工人大罢工时曾给英帝国主义以沉重打击。现在，有着祖国七亿人民的支持，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，香港同胞一定能够掀起更大规模的反英抗暴斗争。我们广州工人誓作香港爱国同胞的强大后盾。
    广州大中学校的红卫兵小将说，英帝国主义在香港干尽了坏事，血债累累，罪恶滔天，必须清算。对英帝国主义的挑衅，我们一定要以牙还牙，坚决进行回击。我们红卫兵小将随时准备响应伟大祖国的号召，同香港爱国同胞一道，彻底粉碎英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。
    在有着反帝斗争光荣传统的上海市，广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和红卫兵小将愤怒地说：香港英国当局不顾我国政府的一再警告，变本加厉地镇压和迫害我爱国同胞，妄图扑灭在香港燃起的伟大的反帝抗暴斗争的怒火。疯狂地不断把迫害升级。我们上海革命人民坚决拥护《人民日报》今天的社论，坚决同香港同胞一道向英帝国主义讨还血债。上钢一厂的无产阶级革命派工人说：英帝国主义残酷迫害我香港爱国同胞，这是对我伟大的七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不可侮的，我们上海工人一定全力支持香港爱国同胞的反迫害斗争。同济大学东方红兵团的革命小将说：美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，英帝国主义也不过是一只纸老虎。英帝国主义胆敢在香港继续胡作非为，必将在七亿中国人民面前碰得粉身碎骨。
    正在支援夏收的山东省鲁迅大学毛泽东思想红卫兵的小将们，今天和贫下中农社员一起听了广播。他们说，英帝国主义欠下我们的老账还没有清算，如今又迫害我爱国同胞，真是欺人太甚。红卫兵小将说，我们是毛主席的红小兵，我们是中国人民解放军的后备军。国内的阶级敌人，我们红卫兵要斗，要打倒；国际上的帝国主义、修正主义，我们红卫兵也要斗，也要打倒。不管是国内的反革命修正主义分子，还是国际上帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，他们都只能在伟大的中国人民面前碰得头破血流，绝没有好下场。
