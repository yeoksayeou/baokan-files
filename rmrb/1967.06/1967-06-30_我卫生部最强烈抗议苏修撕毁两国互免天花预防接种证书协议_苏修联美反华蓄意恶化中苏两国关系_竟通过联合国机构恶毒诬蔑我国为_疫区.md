The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, summoned the Soviet Union's Charge d'Affaires, Burelin, on the evening of June 29th, and handed over to him the statement of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China dated June 29th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China makes the following statement regarding the Soviet Union's unilateral tearing up of the agreement on mutual exemption of smallpox vaccination certificates between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and its slander of China as an area afflicted by smallpox and cholera:

According to reports from the border health quarantine stations of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has unilaterally and unreasonably decided that, starting from July 1st, citizens entering the Soviet Union from China must present smallpox and cholera international vaccination certificates. The Soviet Ministry of Health has also publicized this matter through the United Nations World Health Organization, which is a tool of U.S. imperialism. This is another serious step taken by the Soviet revisionist leadership to collude with the United States against China, further destroy the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, and worsen relations between the two countries. The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China strongly protests against the Soviet Ministry of Health for this.

The agreement on mutual exemption of smallpox vaccination certificates between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union was proposed by the Soviet Ministry of Health on May 28, 1960. At that time, the Chinese side, in the interest of promoting friendship between the peoples of the two countries, agreed to the Soviet side's proposal and reached an agreement on mutual exemption of smallpox vaccination certificates. Now, the Soviet side has unilaterally decided that, starting from July 1st, citizens entering the Soviet Union from China must present smallpox vaccination certificates, which is an act of unilaterally tearing up the agreement between the two countries. The Soviet side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this.

The Soviet revisionist leadership not only unilaterally tears up the agreement on mutual exemption of smallpox vaccination certificates between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union but also announces its unreasonable decision through the United Nations World Health Organization. This malicious slander of the People's Republic of China as an area afflicted by smallpox and cholera is a complete fabrication. China has long eradicated smallpox and cholera, which is well known. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in its desperate situation, attempts to use this fabrication and the United Nations World Health Organization, which is a tool of U.S. imperialism, to damage the international prestige of the great People's Republic of China. This is sheer delusion. It only exposes how far the Soviet revisionists have fallen in becoming lackeys of U.S. imperialism!

The Soviet revisionist leadership's unilateral announcement of its unreasonable decision through the United Nations World Health Organization is another exposure of its ugly face in colluding with the United States against China and creating "two Chinas." We warn the Soviet revisionist leadership that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have long seen through your shameful conspiracy. The more you oppose China, the more you will fail miserably. There will be no other outcome.

    我卫生部最强烈抗议苏修撕毁两国互免天花预防接种证书协议
    苏修联美反华蓄意恶化中苏两国关系
    竟通过联合国机构恶毒诬蔑我国为“疫区”
    新华社二十九日讯　中华人民共和国外交部苏联东欧司负责人受中华人民共和国卫生部的委托，二十九日晚上召见苏联驻华大使馆参赞卜烈仁，把中华人民共和国卫生部二十九日的声明交给了他。中华人民共和国卫生部声明，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国卫生部就苏联卫生部片面撕毁中苏两国互相免验天花预防接种证书协议和污蔑中国为天花、霍乱疫区的事件，声明如下：
    据中华人民共和国边境卫生检疫站报告，苏联片面无理决定，自七月一日起，由中国进入苏联国境的公民，必须出示天花、霍乱国际预防接种证书。苏联卫生部还将此事通过美帝国主义的工具联合国世界卫生组织公布于世界各国。这是苏联修正主义领导集团联美反华、进一步破坏中苏两国人民友谊、恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤。对此，中华人民共和国卫生部向苏联卫生部提出最强烈的抗议。
    中苏两国互相免验天花预防接种证书协议，是苏联卫生部于一九六○年五月二十八日向中华人民共和国卫生部提出的，当时中国方面从促进两国人民友谊出发，同意了苏方的建议，达成了有关互相免验天花预防接种证书的协议。现在，苏方片面决定自七月一日起，由中国入境的公民必须出示天花预防接种证书，是片面撕毁两国协议的行为，苏方必须对由此而产生的一切后果，承担全部责任。
    苏联修正主义领导集团不仅片面撕毁中苏两国互相免验天花预防接种证书协议，并通过联合国世界卫生组织宣布它的无理决定。这种恶意污蔑中华人民共和国为天花、霍乱疫区，是对中华人民共和国的彻头彻尾的造谣诽谤。中国早已消灭了天花、霍乱，这是众所周知的。苏联修正主义领导集团日暮途穷，企图利用这种造谣中伤，利用美帝国主义的工具联合国世界卫生组织，来损害伟大的中华人民共和国的国际威望，完全是痴心妄想。它只能暴露出苏修充当美帝国主义的帮凶，已经堕落到何等地步！
    苏联修正主义领导集团通过联合国世界卫生组织片面宣布它的无理决定，是它联美反华、制造“两个中国”的丑恶嘴脸的又一次大暴露。我们警告苏联修正主义领导集团，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民早已识破了你们的可耻阴谋。你们反华越凶，就会失败得越惨，除此以外，不会有别的什么结果。
