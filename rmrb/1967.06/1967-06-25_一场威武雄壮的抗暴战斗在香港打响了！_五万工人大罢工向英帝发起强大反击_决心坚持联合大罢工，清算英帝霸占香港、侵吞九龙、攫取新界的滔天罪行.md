A magnificent and heroic anti-British struggle has begun in Hong Kong! From today, 50,000 workers from the shipping, transportation, public utilities, shipyards, and major textile mills in Hong Kong and Kowloon have launched a united strike. They have joined forces with the 10,000 Chinese workers who have been on strike against the British authorities and some British-owned enterprises for the past 14 days, forming a mighty army of anti-British strikers. The heroic Hong Kong working class, holding high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is launching a new powerful counterattack against the evil British imperialists with unyielding heroism.

Starting this morning, the majority of workers in the long-distance sea transport and loading systems have gone on strike, bringing Hong Kong's sea transport and loading operations to a virtual standstill. The two largest British-owned warehouses, Kowloon Dock and Wing On Dock, have seen the majority of their workers go on strike. Workers from tugboats, lighters, cargo handlers, and long-distance transport dock workers, as well as drivers of large and small business trucks, have all successfully implemented the united strike, halting all loading operations for long-distance cargo ships. This has dealt a heavy blow to Hong Kong's foreign trade, one of the pillars of its economy.

Public transportation in Hong Kong and Kowloon has been in chaos today. Over 85% of the workers at the Hong Kong Public Bus Company have gone on strike, leaving 310 of the 356 daily operating buses idle. Over 90% of the workers at the Kowloon Public Bus Company have gone on strike, leaving 840 of the 900 buses idle. The majority of tram workers have also gone on strike, leaving 70 of the 100 trams idle.

The bus and tram workers' strike was carried out after overcoming the British police's threat of force. Last night and early this morning, the British authorities dispatched large numbers of "riot police" to monitor the factories of the two bus companies in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Hong Kong Tramways Company, threatening workers to resume work and sending "riot vehicles" to escort a few forced-out vehicles. Even during lunch, "riot police" entered the buses to monitor. However, the majority of workers resisted the British authorities' threats and firmly carried out the strike.

Workers from large and small cargo trucks and taxis, responsible for land transportation, have also largely participated in the strike. They have shown tremendous power in this united strike. Over 90% of the workers from large and small cargo trucks and taxis in the Hong Kong area have gone on strike. Today at noon, the British "Governor's Office," "Colonial Secretary," Stanley Prison, "Police Headquarters," and military departments were in a state of panic due to the stoppage of food supplies such as bread, canned goods, and meat by cargo truck workers.

Early this morning, large numbers of British "riot police" blocked several piers of the Oil Street Ferry Company. Last night's shift workers were not allowed to disembark, and plainclothes agents stayed on the ferries, with "marine police" patrolling nearby. This morning at 8 AM, British police even forced last night's shift workers to continue operating the ferries and sent large numbers of police to workers' dormitories, threatening early shift workers to resume work. However, the early shift workers, despite the enemy's threats, went on strike. Because the workers of another ferry company, "Star Ferry," had already gone on strike 14 days ago, today's sea transportation between Hong Kong and Kowloon has been extremely tense.

The workers of three monopolistic British-owned enterprises—Hong Kong Electric Company, Kowloon Chinese Electric Company, and Hong Kong Telephone Company—also successfully went on strike this morning. The striking workers, while ensuring the power supply to residents, adopted the method of "striking but not cutting off electricity." Departments that can go on strike have gone on strike. Repair and maintenance work outside the three companies has completely stopped. Over 90% of the workers in the repair, power generation, underground lines, and office buildings departments of the Hong Kong Electric Company have gone on strike. Over 80% of the workers at the Kowloon Chinese Electric Company have gone on strike today. The majority of workers at the Hong Kong Telephone Company have also gone on strike. The British bosses of these three companies are at their wits' end due to the workers' strike, in a state of panic, and have been forced to recruit a few foreigners to take over part of the work.

The workers of the two largest British-owned shipyards in Hong Kong—Taikoo Dockyard and Kowloon Dockyard—have also joined the strike today. The workers at Taikoo Dockyard have foiled the British authorities' and management's plot to "close down and reorganize," with the majority going on strike. Production in over 30 departments of this shipyard has largely stopped. Over 95% of the workers at Kowloon Dockyard have gone on strike. Currently, the ships being built and repaired by these two shipyards have been forced to halt work.

Over 80% of the workers at the two large textile mills in Kowloon—Hong Kong Spinning and Weaving Mill and Nanyang Spinning and Weaving Mill—have gone on strike.

Taikoo Sugar Refinery has over 400 workers, with over 300 going on strike, forcing the production of the sugar mill to stop today.

To support this united strike, workers from dozens of knitwear and silk factories in Hong Kong and Kowloon have jointly stopped work for one day today.

Today's striking workers belong to 20 workers' committees opposing British oppression. After the strike, workers have held discussions, study sessions, and denunciation meetings, angrily exposing the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism against the Chinese people in Hong Kong over the past century. They have expressed their determination: to resist British imperialism's brutal national oppression, to defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to settle accounts with British imperialism's heinous crimes of occupying Hong Kong, annexing Kowloon, and seizing the New Territories, and to avenge the martyrs Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming. They must persist in this magnificent and heroic united strike of thousands and tens of thousands, and together with the patriotic people of all strata in Hong Kong and Kowloon, form a mighty army of anti-British and anti-oppression fighters, bravely dealing a fatal blow to the evil British imperialists. They proudly declare: We, the Hong Kong working class, will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but the great Mao Zedong Thought will never be discarded, and the dignity of the Chinese people will never be trampled upon. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory. (With pictures)

Representatives from various sectors in Hong Kong have been visiting the "Governor's Office" to protest against the British authorities' fascist atrocities.

    一场威武雄壮的抗暴战斗在香港打响了！
    五万工人大罢工向英帝发起强大反击
    决心坚持联合大罢工，清算英帝霸占香港、侵吞九龙、攫取新界的滔天罪行
    据新华社香港二十四日电　一场威武雄壮的反英抗暴战斗打响了！从今天开始，五万名港九海运、水陆交通、公用事业、船坞和主要纱厂的工人，举行了联合大罢工。他们和十四天前开始罢工，并一直坚持下来的港英机构和部分英资企业的一万名中国工人大会师，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴罢工大军。英雄的香港工人阶级，正在高举着战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以大无畏的英雄气概，向万恶的英帝国主义发起新的强大反击。
    今天早上开始，远洋海运起卸系统的工人绝大部分罢了工，香港海上起卸运输已基本上处于瘫痪状态。两家最大的英资仓库——九龙仓和均益仓，绝大部分工人都罢了工。港九两地的拖轮和趸船工人，理货员和远洋运输的码头搬运工人，以及大小营业货车工人，一齐胜利地实现了联合大罢工，远洋货轮的起卸工作全部停顿，使作为香港经济支柱之一的对外贸易，受到了沉重的打击。
    港九市内交通今天极为紊乱。香港公共汽车公司有百分之八十五以上的工人参加了罢工，日常行驶的三百五十六部公共汽车，有三百一十多部停驶。九龙公共汽车工人参加罢工的达百分之九十以上，全部九百多部公共汽车，有八百四十部停驶。电车工人也绝大部分罢工，一百辆左右的电车，有七十多辆停驶。
    公共汽车和电车工人的罢工，是战胜了港英警察的武力威胁后举行的。昨天深夜和今天凌晨，港英派出大批“防暴队”分别监视港九两家公共汽车公司的工厂和香港电车公司工厂，威胁工人开工，并派出“防暴车”前后押送少数被迫开出的车辆，被迫开车的汽车工人甚至在中午吃饭时，“防暴队”也进入车厢进行监视。但是大部分工人抵制了港英当局的威胁，坚决实行罢工。
    担负陆上交通运输的大、小型货车和出租汽车工人，绝大部分参加了罢工。他们在联合大罢工中显示了巨大的威力。香港区出租的营业大货车和小型货车工人，参加罢工的达到百分之九十以上，出租汽车达到百分之八十五。今天中午，港英“总督府”，“辅政司”、赤柱监狱、“警察总部”和军部等港英机构，由于货车工人停运面包、罐头、肉类等食品，使这些机构狼狈万分。
    今天凌晨，大批港英“防暴队”封锁了油麻地渡海小轮公司的几个码头。昨晚上晚班的工人被禁止上岸，便衣特务赖在小轮上，船旁还有“水警轮”看守。今天上午八时，港英警察竟强迫昨晚晚班的工人继续开船，并派出大批警察到工人宿舍，威胁早班工人开工。但是，早班工人不顾敌人的威胁并举行了罢工。由于另一家渡海小轮公司“天星”渡轮公司的工人，早在十四天前就已罢了工，因此，今天港九两地的海上交通极为紧张。
    三家垄断性的英资企业——香港电灯公司、九龙中华电力公司和香港电话公司的工人，今天早上也胜利地举行了罢工。罢工工人在照顾居民用电的原则下，采取了“罢工不罢电”的方式，可以罢工的部门就罢工。三家公司和街外修理和维修工作，已经完全停止。香港电灯公司的修理、发电、地线和办公大楼等各部门工人，参加罢工的占百分之九十。九龙中华电力公司今天罢工的工人，也达到百分之八十以上。香港电话公司的工人大部分罢了工。这三家公司的英国老板因为工人的罢工而一筹莫展，狼狈不堪，被迫搜罗少数外国人来接替部分工作。
    两家英资的香港最大的船坞——太古船坞和九龙船坞的工人，今天也参加了罢工的行列。太古船坞的工人今天粉碎了港英和资方“闭门改组”的阴谋，大部分罢了工，这个船坞的三十多个部门的生产大部分停止。九龙船坞参加罢工的工人达百分之九十五以上。目前，这两家船坞正在赶制和修理的轮船，已被迫停工。
    九龙两家大纱厂——香港纱厂和南洋纱厂参加罢工的工人占百分之八十以上。
    太古糖厂共有四百多名工人，因为有三百多人罢了工，糖房的生产今天被迫停止。
    为了支持这次联合大罢工，港九几十家毛衫厂和丝织厂的工人，在今天联合停工一天。
    今天参加罢工的工人，分属于二十个工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会。在罢工以后，工人们纷纷举行座谈会、学习会和控诉大会，愤怒揭发英帝国主义对香港中国同胞一百多年来所犯下的滔天罪行，他们斗志昂扬地表示：为了反抗英帝国主义残酷的民族压迫，为了保卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，为了清算英帝国主义霸占香港、侵吞九龙，攫取新界的滔天罪行，为了替徐田波、黎松、曾明等死难烈士报仇，一定要坚持这个威武雄壮、千军万马的联合大罢工，并和港九各阶层爱国同胞一起，组成一支浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴大军，勇猛地给万恶的英帝国主义以致命的打击。他们豪迈地说：我们香港工人阶级永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们的头可断，血可流，伟大的毛泽东思想决不可丢，中国人民的尊严决不可侮。我们不获全胜，誓不收兵。（附图片）
