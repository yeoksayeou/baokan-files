Yan'an Middle School in Tianjin, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has achieved the broadest revolutionary alliance with the leftists as the core, based on teaching classes. Their direction is correct, and their methods are appropriate. This great alliance is beneficial for implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"; beneficial for seizing the revolution, promoting teaching, and resuming classes to make a revolution; beneficial for cultivating students' organizational discipline; and beneficial for the deepening of the Cultural Revolution and the thorough completion of the school's tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Chairman Mao said: The army should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for colleges, middle schools, and upper grades of primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and implementing struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The comrades of the People's Liberation Army who participated in the military training at Yan'an Middle School executed Chairman Mao's instructions, did a great deal of work, and achieved significant results. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly grasped the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly exposed, criticized, and denounced the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line fabricated by the biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party, and eliminated its poison. Through a thorough revolutionary criticism, they raised the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, unified their ideological understanding, and clarified the distinction between enemies and friends. This laid a solid ideological foundation for achieving the broadest revolutionary alliance with the leftists as the core, based on teaching classes.

The experience of Yan'an Middle School is most important in two aspects.

First, it is to firmly support the leftists, especially to support them politically. It is necessary to guide the proletarian revolutionary faction to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to break down the "self" and establish the "public," to overcome erroneous thoughts such as small-groupism, factionalism, and anarchism, and to achieve ideological revolutionization. It is also necessary to persuade students to follow Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes, except for the elderly and the sick. Let these people participate to facilitate their reform. Learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people, and through meticulous ideological work, unite the broadest revolutionary teachers and students.

Second, it is to actively create conditions to promote the realization of class alliances. It is necessary to adhere to the mass line, mobilize the masses, and let them voluntarily and consciously do so after thorough discussion. Administrative commands and methods of disbanding revolutionary mass organizations should not be adopted.

    中学无产阶级革命派大联合的好形式		本报评论员
    天津延安中学，在人民解放军的帮助下，以教学班为基础，实现了以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合。他们的方向是对头的，方法是正确的。这种大联合，有利于实现革命的“三结合”；有利于抓革命，促教学，复课闹革命；有利于培养学生的组织性、纪律性；有利于文化大革命的深入开展，彻底完成学校的斗、批、改任务。
    毛主席说：军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。
    人民解放军参加延安中学军训的同志，执行了毛主席的这一指示，做了大量的工作，取得了很大成绩。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，紧紧抓住两条路线斗争这个纲，彻底揭发、批判、控诉党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所炮制的资产阶级反动路线的罪行，肃清其流毒，通过革命的大批判，使广大革命师生提高了阶级觉悟，统一了思想认识，分清了敌我友，为实现以教学班为基础的以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，打下了牢固的思想基础。
    延安中学的经验，最重要的有两条。
    第一，是要坚决支持左派，特别是要从政治上支持，要引导无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，克服小团体主义、山头主义、无政府主义等错误思想，实现思想革命化。还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。要学会正确处理人民内部矛盾，通过深入细致的思想工作，团结最广泛的革命师生。
    第二，要积极创造条件，促进班级大联合的实现。要坚持走群众路线，放手发动群众，经过群众充分的酝酿，自觉自愿地去做。不能采取行政命令的办法，更不能采取取缔革命群众组织的办法。
