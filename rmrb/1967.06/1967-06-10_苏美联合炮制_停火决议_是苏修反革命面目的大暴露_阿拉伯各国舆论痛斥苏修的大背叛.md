The Soviet revisionist leadership clique colluded with American imperialism to fabricate a resolution in the United Nations Security Council that betrays the interests of the Arab people, sparking strong discontent and indignation among the public and media in Arab countries.

An Iraqi journalist said: For the Arab people, the Soviet revisionist leadership is a great traitor. They colluded with American imperialism to call for a ceasefire through the Security Council, deceiving us into surrender. This betrays the interests of the Arab people and aids American imperialism and its tool, Israel.

Another Iraqi friend, while condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying the Arab people, pointed out that the Soviet government's statement did not even dare to condemn American imperialism and its lackey, Israel, as aggressors. He said: "This is a major exposure of the Soviet revisionists' counter-revolutionary face. We Arab people now see this clearly. We also understand what their so-called 'peaceful coexistence' is all about."

The editorial in the Iraqi newspaper *Voice of the Arabs* on the 8th angrily exposed the Security Council's ceasefire resolution, and in a sarcastic tone condemned the Soviet revisionist clique, saying: "We thank you, because you have given us a memorable lesson!"

The main newspapers in Sudan published editorials and comments on the 8th, all exposing the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's fake support and true betrayal of the Arab anti-aggression war.

The editorial in *Al-Ayam* said: "The stance of the Soviet leaders is not surprising. They have taken similar stances in the past in Cuba and now in Vietnam."

*The Opinion* angrily criticized the Soviet revisionists for issuing a ceasefire resolution with the Americans, without condemning Israel's aggression. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet authorities would encourage imperialism to carry out more aggression.

*The News Daily* published three articles condemning the Soviet revisionists. The newspaper pointed out in one article that the Soviet revisionist government's statement was against the interests of the Arabs and completely supported the imperialist aggressors.

The Algerian News Agency published a commentary in the evening of the 8th, pointing out that the ceasefire resolution concocted by the Americans and Soviets "is nothing but an order for Arab countries to surrender, because this ceasefire request does not specify the aggressor."

The commentary pointed out that the protectors of Zionism are using the opportunity of Israel occupying part of Arab territory to push for a ceasefire, aiming to "start negotiations based on the strength of their position."

On the same day, Algerian radio continuously broadcasted marching songs and patriotic songs, interspersed with passionate slogans such as: "The era of powerful countries issuing orders to the Arab nation has passed!"

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra* commented on the so-called ceasefire resolution on the 8th, saying, "Despite the imperialists' crazy international conspiracies, the people and the forces loving peace are clear." The newspaper emphasized: We have the absolute right to counter the aggression.

    苏美联合炮制“停火决议”是苏修反革命面目的大暴露
    阿拉伯各国舆论痛斥苏修的大背叛
    据新华社九日讯　苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝国主义，在联合国安全理事会炮制背叛阿拉伯人民利益的“停火决议”，引起了阿拉伯国家公众和舆论的强烈不满和愤慨。
    一位伊拉克新闻工作者说：对于阿拉伯人民说来，苏修领导集团是大叛徒。它勾结美帝国主义，通过安全理事会呼吁“停火”，诱骗我们投降。这是背叛阿拉伯人民的利益，帮助美帝国主义及其工具以色列。
    另一位伊拉克朋友在谴责苏修领导集团背叛阿拉伯人民时指出，苏联政府在声明中甚至不敢谴责美帝国主义及其走狗以色列是侵略者。他说：“这是苏修反革命面目的大暴露。我们阿拉伯人民现在看清了这一点。我们也懂得了他们所鼓吹的‘和平共处’是什么货色。”
    伊拉克《阿拉伯之声报》八日的社论愤怒揭露安理会的“停火决议”，并且用讽刺的口吻谴责苏修集团说：“我们要感谢你们，因为你们给我们上了一堂令人难忘的课！”
    苏丹各主要报纸八日的社论和评论，都揭露苏联修正主义领导集团对阿拉伯反侵略战争假支持、真出卖的丑恶面目。
    《天天报》的评论说：“苏联领导人的这种立场并不奇怪。他们过去在古巴，现在在越南，都采取了类似的立场。”
    《舆论报》愤怒抨击苏修同美国人发表“停火决议”，而不谴责以色列的侵略。报纸指出，苏联当局将鼓励帝国主义进行更多的侵略。
    《新闻日报》发表了三篇谴责苏修的文章。报纸在一篇文章中指出，苏修政府的声明是违反阿拉伯人的利益，而完全支持帝国主义侵略者的。
    阿尔及利亚新闻社八日晚上发表评论指出，美苏合谋搞的这种“停火决议”，“不是什么别的东西，而只是通令阿拉伯国家投降，因为这个停火要求没有指明侵略者。”
    评论指出，犹太复国主义的保护人利用以色列霸占一部分阿拉伯领土的时机来搞“停火”，是要“依靠实力地位着手进行谈判。”
    同天，阿尔及利亚电台不断播送进行曲和爱国歌曲，中间穿插激昂慷慨的口号，如：“强国对阿拉伯民族发号施令的时代已经一去不复返了！”
    叙利亚《革命报》八日在评论所谓“停火决议”时说，“尽管帝国主义疯狂地搞国际阴谋，人民和爱好和平的力量是清楚的。”报纸强调指出：我们有绝对的权利反击侵略。
