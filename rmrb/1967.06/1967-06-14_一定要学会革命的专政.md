The peasants of our Daquanshan Brigade in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, have studied the May 16, 1966, Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and have gained a deeper understanding that all class struggles are political struggles, and all political struggles revolve around the issue of state power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." We poor and lower-middle peasants know the bitterness of not having power and the sweetness of having power. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in his book "On Cultivation," does not mention the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he supported the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen, put forward the "Draft Outline of the Report," and tried to confine the political struggle in the cultural sphere to so-called "pure academic" discussions. He also concocted a reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to encircle and suppress the revolutionary forces, implementing a white terror. This is a counter-revolutionary act against the dictatorship of the proletariat, aiming to implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and restore capitalism in China.

State power is a tool for one class to oppress another. Before liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered cruel oppression and exploitation because the landlords and the bourgeoisie held the power. At that time, the sky belonged to the landlords, and the land belonged to the landlords. In our village of Daquanshan, there were only a dozen or so households, all of them impoverished, but the landlords still seized several hilltops to use as pastures. My family originally had eight people, but we were driven to the point where some died and some were sold, leaving only me alive. In the old society, how many families suffered such tragic fates like mine?

It was the great leader Chairman Mao who led us in revolution, overthrowing the "three big mountains" that had been oppressing us and seizing power. Only then did the working people take their destiny into their own hands.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The dictatorship of the revolution and the dictatorship of the counter-revolution are of opposite natures, but the former learns from the latter. This learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling the counter-revolutionary class, they will not be able to maintain power, and their power will be overthrown by the internal and external reactionaries. The internal and external reactionaries will restore power in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer." The landlords and the bourgeoisie hold power and implement dictatorship over the working people; the working people hold power and must implement dictatorship over the landlords and the bourgeoisie. Therefore, we must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are the most harmful representatives of the bourgeoisie who attempt to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must implement dictatorship over them to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

We poor and lower-middle peasants must fully recognize the long-term nature of the struggle against the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the struggle of the proletariat against restoration under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must never forget class struggle and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    一定要学会革命的专政
    山西省阳高县大泉山大队党支部书记　高进才
    我们大泉山大队的贫下中农，学习了中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，更加深刻地体会到一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争，一切政治斗争都是围绕着政权进行的。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”我们贫下中农知道没有政权的苦，更知道有了政权的甜。但是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在他的《修养》中闭口不谈无产阶级专政的问题。他在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，支持彭真反革命修正主义集团，抛出了《汇报提纲》，硬要把文化领域的政治斗争纳入所谓“纯学术”讨论，并炮制了一条资产阶级反动路线，围剿革命派，实行白色恐怖。这就是反对无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政，妄图在中国复辟资本主义。
    政权是一个阶级压迫一个阶级的工具。解放前，我们贫下中农受尽残酷的压迫和剥削，就是因为印把子在地主资产阶级的手里。那时候，天是地主的天，地是地主的地。我们大泉山村仅仅十几户人家，家家穷得精光，但是，地主还把几个山头霸占去做牧场。我家原有八口人，被地主逼得死的死，卖的卖，只留下我一个人。在旧社会，象我家这样悲惨的遭遇，哪止是千家万户啊！
    是伟大的领袖毛主席领导我们闹革命，推翻了压在我们头上的“三座大山”，夺取了政权。这样，劳动人民才把命运掌握在自己的手里。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。这个学习很要紧。革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外的反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。”地主资产阶级掌握了政权，对劳动人民实行专政；劳动人民掌握了政权，就是要对地主资产阶级实行专政。因此，我们决不能忘记无产阶级政权。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的危害最大的资产阶级代表人物。我们只有对他们实行专政，才能巩固无产阶级专政。
    我们贫下中农一定要充分地认识无产阶级专政条件下资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的长期性，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底斗倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
