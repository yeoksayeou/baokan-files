The new battle cry for the patriotic struggle against British oppression in Hong Kong has been sounded.

The Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of twenty unions in Hong Kong's maritime, land and water transportation, public utilities, shipyards, and textile industries issued a "Joint Strike Notice to Fellow Workers in All Industries" yesterday, solemnly declaring that starting from June 24, workers from these twenty unions will launch a joint strike. This is a new call to arms from the workers and patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong against the heinous British imperialism, marking the beginning of a new high tide in the patriotic struggle against British oppression in Hong Kong.

Since early May, the great struggle against British oppression in Hong Kong has surged forward wave after wave. In the previous stage, the massive anti-British oppression movement, with the working class at its core, has initially dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong, shaking the decaying and declining British imperialism. Now, the twenty unions in Hong Kong, with their mighty and grand joint strike, have formed a powerful iron fist, striking fiercely at the dying British imperialism in Hong Kong.

In history, the working class of Hong Kong has not once but many times confronted British imperialism. At that time, although imperialism used bayonets, machine guns, and warships to suppress the Hong Kong workers, the striking workers, when organized, launched powerful counterattacks, causing the entire Hong Kong to become paralyzed, turning into a "stinking harbor" and a "dead harbor," making British imperialism lose its soul. History has proven that as long as the working class is organized and united with all patriotic forces to persist in the struggle, they have the power to defeat British imperialism.

Today, the conditions for the struggle of Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots are completely different from before. The most important point is that the balance of power between the enemy and us has fundamentally changed. Socialist China is incredibly powerful, while our enemy, British imperialism, has completely declined, is setting in the west, and is gasping for breath. With the resolute support of the people of the entire country, the brave Hong Kong working class and patriotic compatriots will certainly achieve even greater victories in the struggle against British oppression.

However, it must be pointed out that British imperialism, this bankrupt, is still making desperate struggles in Hong Kong.

Violent suppression and savage persecution are the main tactics of British imperialism against the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. It has repeatedly created bloody incidents. Just before this new joint strike, the Hong Kong authorities even sent a large number of "riot police" to attack the Hong Kong Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union in Kowloon's Mong Kok, ruthlessly opening fire on the workers. British imperialism will never lay down its butcher's knife. Various signs indicate that they are plotting further bloody suppression of Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots. This has already attracted the serious attention of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the people of the entire country.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various persecutions inflicted on the revolutionary people by imperialism and reactionaries will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." If they want to use poisonous hands, we will "repay them in their own coin." The brutal suppression by British imperialism can only provoke broader and more intense resistance from the compatriots of Hong Kong. The compatriots of Hong Kong and all the people of China will never forgive this group of British imperialist butchers who slaughter our patriotic compatriots.

Another tactic of British imperialism is to bribe and lure, splitting the ranks of Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots. The cunning British imperialism has obviously misjudged its target.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Chinese people have backbone." The heroic workers of Hong Kong have backbone. The workers and patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong neither fear violence nor are afraid of imperialist suppression, and they will absolutely not be tempted by bribes, nor will they be fooled by imperialism.

British imperialism appears ferocious on the surface, but in reality, it is very weak. The British imperialist elements stationed in Hong Kong are not already restless and anxious, fearing for their lives? The former glory of British imperialism has been swept away, and now they still want to puff up their faces to look fat, which can only become a laughing stock of the whole world.

No matter what means British imperialism adopts, the working class and patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a vast army of anti-British and anti-oppression, marching forward triumphantly on the road to victory.

Brave workers and patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, mobilize further, organize, and widely launch strikes, boycotts, and use all effective means to strike back at British imperialism, let it taste the fist of the Chinese working class again!

    让英帝尝一尝中国工人阶级的拳头！
    本报评论员
    香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的新的进军号吹响了。
    香港海运、水陆交通、公共事业、船坞、纺织业等二十个工会的反对港英迫害斗争委员会，昨天发表了《联合大罢工告各业工友书》，庄严宣告，从六月二十四日起，这二十个工会的工人举行联合大罢工。这是香港工人和爱国同胞向万恶的英帝国主义发出的新的讨伐令，揭开了香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争新高潮的序幕。
    从五月初开始，香港反英抗暴的伟大斗争，一浪高过一浪地向前发展。前一阶段以工人阶级为核心的轰轰烈烈的反英抗暴群众运动，初步地给予了英帝国主义在香港的反动统治以沉重的打击，震撼了腐朽衰败的英帝国主义。现在，香港二十个工会声势浩大、规模壮阔的联合大罢工，形成了一只强大的铁拳，向着垂死的港英帝国主义猛击过去。
    在历史上，香港工人阶级不止一次地同英帝国主义进行过较量。那个时候，尽管帝国主义用刺刀、机关枪和军舰来对付香港工人，但是罢工工人组织起来，进行强大的反击，曾经使整个香港陷于瘫痪，变成“臭港”、“死港”，使英帝国主义丧魂落魄。历史事实证明，只要工人阶级组织起来，团结一切爱国力量坚持斗争，他们完全有力量打败英帝国主义。
    今天，香港工人和爱国同胞的斗争条件，比起以往，已经完全不同。最主要的一条就是，敌我力量的对比，发生了根本的变化。社会主义的中国无比的强大，而我们的敌人英帝国主义，却已经完全没落，日薄西山，气息奄奄了。在全国人民的坚决支援下，英勇的香港工人阶级和爱国同胞一定能够在反英抗暴斗争中赢得更加伟大的胜利。
    但是，必须指出，英帝国主义这个破落户，还在香港进行着疯狂的挣扎。
    暴力镇压和野蛮迫害，是当前英帝国主义对付香港爱国同胞的主要一手。它接二连三地制造了流血事件。就在这次新的联合大罢工的前夕，港英当局竟然派出大批“防暴队”袭击九龙旺角树胶塑胶业总工会，悍然开枪残杀工人。港英帝国主义是绝不会放下屠刀的。种种迹象表明，它们正在策划着对香港工人和爱国同胞进一步血腥镇压的阴谋。这已经引起我香港爱国同胞和全国人民的严重注意。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：帝国主义和反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”他们要下毒手，我们就要“以其人之道，还治其人之身”。英帝国主义的残暴镇压，也只能激起香港同胞更广泛更剧烈的反抗。香港同胞和全中国人民决不会饶过这一伙残杀我爱国同胞的英帝国主义刽子手。
    英帝国主义的另外一手，就是进行收买和拉拢，分化香港工人和爱国同胞的队伍。老奸巨猾的英帝国主义显然看错了对象。
    毛主席教导说：“我们中国人是有骨气的。”英雄的香港工人是有骨气的。香港工人和爱国同胞既不畏强暴，不怕帝国主义的镇压，也绝不受利诱，绝不上帝国主义的当。
    英帝国主义表面上张牙舞爪，样子很凶。拆穿了，骨子里虚弱得很。盘踞香港的英帝国主义分子，不是已经坐卧不安、惶惶不可终日了吗？英帝国主义昔日的威风已经扫地，现在还想打肿脸充胖子，这只能成为全世界的笑柄。
    不管英帝国主义采取什么手段，香港工人阶级和爱国同胞，将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，组成浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴的大军，在胜利的大道上豪迈地行进。
    英勇的香港工人和爱国同胞们，进一步动员起来，组织起来，广泛展开罢工罢市和利用一切有效的手段，痛击英帝国主义，让它再尝一尝中国工人阶级铁拳头的滋味！
