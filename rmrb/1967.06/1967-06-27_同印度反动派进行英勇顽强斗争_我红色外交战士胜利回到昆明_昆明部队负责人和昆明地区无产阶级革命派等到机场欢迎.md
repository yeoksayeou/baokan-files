To safeguard national dignity and defend the Five-Star Red Flag with blood, eight of our diplomatic warriors who were severely injured after being incited by Indian reactionary government thugs, returned to Kunming today at noon on a special plane sent by the Chinese government from Dhaka, East Pakistan, after a brave and tenacious struggle against Indian reactionaries.

Representatives from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, revolutionary cadres from Kunming, Red Guards, PLA soldiers, and relevant department heads, totaling over 600 people, went to the airport to warmly welcome the victorious return of the red diplomats. They strongly condemned the Indian reactionaries' anti-China provocations.

The victorious return of our embassy's First Secretary Chen Luzhi and other red diplomats from the Indian embassy, stepping off the plane, held high the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, waving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" excitedly, and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" At this moment, the welcoming crowd set off firecrackers and drums. "Warmly welcome the victorious return of the red diplomats!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The slogans echoed through the sky. The Red Guards rushed towards the brave red diplomats, presenting Mao's portraits, and pinned Mao badges and quotations on their chests.

Xie Chenghao, the Third Secretary of our Indian embassy who was forced to return to China by the Indian reactionary government, also arrived in Kunming this noon on another plane, receiving a warm welcome from representatives of the revolutionary cadres.

The Deputy Consul General Li Feng of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Consulate General in Kunming also came to the airport to welcome them.

According to a report from Dhaka on the 26th, the First Secretary Chen Luzhi of the Chinese Embassy in India and seven other red diplomats boarded a special plane in the morning of the 26th to return to their country from Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan.

These eight Chinese red diplomats were warmly seen off by the Acting Consul General Xu Ying of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, the Consul General Zong Shengqing of the Chinese Consulate General in Dhaka, and the staff of the Chinese Consulate General in Dhaka.

On the 25th, a special delegation from Beijing, including the responsible person Xu Jingwu from the First Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the revolutionary cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, doctors, and nurses, also boarded the same plane to leave.

Before boarding the plane, the eight injured Chinese red diplomats waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!"

Members of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Association and many airport workers stood in rows, waving goodbye to the Chinese red diplomats.

After arriving in Dhaka on the 25th, the eight injured comrades from China were immediately treated by doctors and nurses sent by China. The staff of the Chinese Consulate General in Dhaka held a welcoming party for them in the evening of the 25th.

Local Pakistani friends brought tropical fruits to visit the Chinese red diplomats, expressing their sympathy and respect.

According to a report from Kathmandu on the 25th, the First Secretary Chen Luzhi of the Chinese Embassy in India and seven other diplomats boarded a plane in the morning of the 25th to leave Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and return to their country via Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan.
