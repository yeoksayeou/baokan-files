A piece of paper cannot conceal the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Arab people. The seven-nation statement is all show and tells more about the traitors' ugly faces.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, a message from Moscow: The Soviet revisionist leadership, due to its role as an accomplice in the recent U.S.-British-Israeli war of aggression and its betrayal of Arab countries, has been severely criticized by the Arab people. On the 9th, it hastily gathered a small group of followers from Eastern Europe and the Tito clique in Moscow to issue a joint statement, attempting to cover up its already exposed accomplice face and continue to serve U.S. imperialism.

Those dragged to Moscow by the Soviet revisionists to sign this statement include: the party and government leaders of the revisionist states of Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, as well as the Tito clique. The notorious traitor Tito was particularly enthusiastic, personally going to Moscow at the command of his American masters to participate in this attempt to salvage the Soviet revisionists' embarrassing situation in the Middle East.

In their statement, the seven nations used every possible flowery language, loudly proclaiming their "complete support" for the just struggle of the Arab countries and their willingness to "provide assistance." However, this seven-nation statement, like the Soviet revisionists' previous statements, avoids condemning the chief culprit behind this aggression, U.S. imperialism. This shows how close these revisionist cliques are to U.S. and British imperialism and how ruthless they are towards the Arab people.

The statement threatens in a showy manner that if Israel does not immediately stop its aggression and withdraw its troops beyond the ceasefire line, they will "make every necessary effort to help the Arab people resolutely repel the aggressors." This is completely a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, an attempt to continue playing the trick of false support and true betrayal, and is nothing but empty promises and worthless pieces of paper.

The seven-nation statement also praised the "Security Council resolution," shouting that "condemning the aggressors is the responsibility of the United Nations" and that "decisive joint action" is needed. This shows that the Soviet revisionists are still trying to use the United Nations to control the Arab countries and also to bring in the revisionist states of Eastern Europe, attempting to expand the "joint action" of the Soviet, U.S., and British, to boost their morale and cover up their traitorous faces. However, these tricks by the Soviet revisionist clique can only make things worse.

    一纸空文难掩苏修叛卖阿拉伯人民的罪恶行径
    七国声明装腔作势更暴露叛徒丑恶面目
    据新华社十二日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联修正主义领导集团由于在这次美英以侵略战争中为虎作伥、干出出卖阿拉伯国家的罪恶勾当而遭到全体阿拉伯人民的怒声痛斥，在九日匆匆忙忙把它在东欧的一小撮追随者和铁托叛徒集团纠合到莫斯科，发表了一个联合声明，企图借此掩盖其已经暴露无遗的帮凶嘴脸，继续为美帝国主义效劳。
    被苏修拉到莫斯科签署这个声明的有：保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克修字号国家的党政头目和铁托叛徒集团。铁托这个臭名远扬的叛徒显得特别卖力，他奉美国主子之命，亲自出马到莫斯科，参与这一企图挽救苏修在中东狼狈处境的勾当。
    苏修等七国在它们的声明中用尽了花言巧语，大肆扬言它们“完全支持”阿拉伯国家的正义斗争，并将“给予它们援助”。可是，这个七国声明却还象苏修前些时候发表的声明一样，闭口不谴责制造这次侵略的罪魁祸首美帝国主义。可见这帮修正主义集团对美英帝国主义是如此的亲，而对阿拉伯人民是何等的狠。
    声明装腔作势地威胁说，如果以色列不立即停止侵略、不把军队撤到停战线以外，他们就“将作出一切必要的努力来帮助阿拉伯人民坚决击退侵略者”。这完全是马后炮，是想继续玩弄假支持真出卖的骗人花招，是一文不值的空口诺言和一纸空文而已。
    七国声明还大肆吹捧“安理会决议”，叫嚷“谴责侵略者是联合国的职责”、需要采取
  “坚决的联合行动”。这表明，苏修还企图利用联合国控制阿拉伯国家，并把东欧的修字号国家也收罗进去，力图扩大苏美英的“联合行动”，以壮声势，掩盖它的叛徒嘴脸。但是苏修集团的这些花招，只能是欲盖弥彰。
