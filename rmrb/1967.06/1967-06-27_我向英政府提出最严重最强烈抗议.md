The Chinese people resolutely support the Hong Kong workers in their large-scale strike to counter the suppression by the Hong Kong British authorities. The Chinese government solemnly warns the British government: the blood debt owed to the residents of Hong Kong must be repaid, and there is no way to escape it.

New China News Agency, June 26th: Today, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo summoned the British Charge d'Affaires Hopson and handed him a note. The note strongly protests the British government for the armed suppression of our patriotic workers and residents by the Hong Kong British authorities on June 23rd, and the suppression of the demonstrators in Sha Tau Kok, Kowloon, by the Hong Kong British "riot police" on June 24th. The full text of the note is as follows:

British Mission:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China requests that the British Mission immediately convey the following to the British government.

On June 23rd, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of military police, "riot police," and plainclothes agents to attack the General Union of Rubber and Plastic Workers in Kowloon, carrying out a new armed suppression against our patriotic workers and residents. During this suppression, the Hong Kong military police brazenly shot and killed the Chinese worker Zhu Yongshan on the spot, injured several people, and arbitrarily arrested dozens more. It has now been confirmed that two more people were brutally killed in prison. This is another crime committed by the Hong Kong British authorities against the Chinese people, following the killing of our patriotic compatriots Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming on June 8th, adding another debt of blood.

On June 24th, the Hong Kong British "riot police" again suppressed the demonstrators in Sha Tau Kok, Kowloon, injuring and arresting more than a dozen people, and shamelessly throwing tear gas into our territory, injuring more than 30 of our people.

The Chinese government and people strongly condemn the brazen provocation and fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and strongly protest to the British government.

Since May this year, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government and people, the Hong Kong British authorities have continued to carry out bloody suppression against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. To date, seven of our patriotic compatriots have been brutally killed by the Hong Kong military police, and more than 1,400 have been arbitrarily arrested or sentenced, many of whom have been savagely beaten by the Hong Kong police. Now, the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities are still threatening to further expand the fascist suppression of our compatriots.

Faced with the brazen provocation and brutal persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities, the Hong Kong workers can no longer tolerate it. To defend national dignity and to counter the suppression by the Hong Kong British authorities, they solemnly declared on June 24th to begin a large-scale joint strike. Their actions are just and have the firm support of the people across the country. The Chinese government demands that the British government immediately order the Hong Kong British authorities to honestly accept all legitimate demands of the patriotic workers and compatriots in Hong Kong and immediately implement the five serious demands proposed in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 15th.

At present, the situation in Hong Kong has reached a serious stage. This is entirely the doing of the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities. If the Hong Kong British authorities do not heed the warnings of the Chinese government and people and continue to persecute our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, they will only deepen their own guilt. The Chinese government solemnly warns the British government: the blood debt owed to the residents of Hong Kong must be repaid. The more is owed, the more must be repaid, and there is no way to escape it.

    港英当局猖狂挑衅不断武装镇压我爱国同胞
    我向英政府提出最严重最强烈抗议
    中国人民坚决支持香港工人为反击港英当局的镇压而举行大规模的联合罢工。中国政府严重警告英国政府：对中国香港居民所欠的血债必须偿还，要想逃掉是绝对办不到的。
    新华社二十六日讯　中国外交部副部长罗贵波今天上午召见英国驻华代办霍普森，交给他一份照会，就六月二十三日香港英国当局出动大批军警、“防暴队”和便衣特务袭击九龙树胶塑胶业总工会，对我爱国工人和居民进行新的武装镇压，以及六月二十四日港英“防暴队”又在九龙沙头角镇压游行示威的群众，向英国政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：英国代办处：
    中华人民共和国外交部要求英国代办处立即把下列事项转告英国政府。
    六月二十三日，香港英国当局出动大批军警、“防暴队”和便衣特务，袭击九龙树胶塑胶业总工会，对我爱国工人和居民进行了新的武装镇压。在这次镇压中，港英军警竟然明目张胆地当场开枪打死中国工人诸永山，枪伤数人，并且无理逮捕了几十人。据现在查明其中又有二人在狱中惨遭杀害。这是香港英国当局继六月八日杀害我爱国同胞徐田波、黎松、曾明等三人之后，对中国人民犯下的又一新的罪行，欠下的又一笔新的血债。
    六月二十四日，港英“防暴队”又在九龙沙头角镇压游行示威的群众，打伤和逮捕了十几人，并且悍然将催泪弹施放到我方境内，使我方群众三十多人受伤。
    中国政府和中国人民强烈谴责香港英国当局的这种猖狂挑衅和法西斯暴行，并向英国政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    今年五月以来，香港英国当局不顾中国政府和中国人民的多次警告，不断对我香港爱国同胞进行血腥镇压。迄至目前为止，我爱国同胞七人已经惨遭港英军警杀害，一千四百多人被无理逮捕或判刑，其中许多人受到港英警察极其野蛮的毒打。现在，英国政府和香港英国当局还在继续叫嚣，要进一步扩大对我国同胞的法西斯镇压。
    在香港英国当局的猖狂挑衅和残酷迫害面前，香港工人忍无可忍。为了维护民族的尊严，为了反击香港英国当局的镇压，他们庄严宣告于六月二十四日开始举行大规模的联合罢工。他们的行动是正义的，得到全国人民的坚决支持。中国政府要求英国政府立即责成香港英国当局老老实实接受香港爱国工人和各界爱国同胞的一切正当要求，立即实现中国外交部五月十五日声明中提出的五项严正要求。
    目前，香港局势已经发展到了严重的地步。这完全是英国政府和香港英国当局一手造成的。如果香港英国当局不听中国政府和中国人民的警告，继续迫害我香港爱国同胞，那么，它就只能加深自己的罪孽。中国政府要严重警告英国政府：对中国香港居民所欠的血债必须偿还。欠的愈多，偿的愈重，要想逃掉是绝对办不到的。
