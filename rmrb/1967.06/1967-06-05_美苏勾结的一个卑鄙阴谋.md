Recently, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership have been making a big fuss about Indo-Pakistani relations. They have been continually throwing out schemes such as the Kashmir problem negotiation plan, the proposal for Indo-Pakistani joint ventures, the suggestion for both sides to reduce military armaments, and so on. The tricks are endless, with the sole purpose of coercing Pakistan to abandon its independent and autonomous foreign policy and form an anti-China alliance with the Indian reactionaries. This is a plot by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to establish an anti-China encirclement in Asia.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union aim to establish an anti-China encirclement in Asia for two purposes. On the one hand, they indeed want to strategically encircle China and are preparing to launch military provocations against China. On the other hand, they are using the cover of anti-China activities to control and invade the countries surrounding China. The countries that are drawn into this anti-China encirclement will first suffer from this misfortune.

The Indian Congress Party reactionary government is the most fervent in its anti-China stance, serving as the most frenzied and loyal lackey of the U.S.-Soviet counter-revolutionary alliance. It sells out India's national interests, relying on the support and "aid" of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to maintain its reactionary rule. Its domestic and foreign policies are entirely subservient to U.S. imperialism. It is extremely isolated among Asian and African countries, and its international status has plummeted. Domestically, it has caused widespread poverty and starvation, and the broad masses of laboring people can no longer survive. The Indian reactionaries, acting as the U.S. and Soviet Union's henchmen, have been anti-China for several years without harming China in the slightest. However, the Congress Party government's reactionary policies have further reduced India, such a large country, to the status of a colony in reality.

The Pakistani government implements an independent and autonomous foreign policy, actively maintains friendly relations with China, and strives to promote unity among Asian and African countries. This policy is in line with Pakistan's national interests. This policy has also earned Pakistan sincere friendship and support internationally, and it enjoys a good reputation among Asian and African countries.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union, in the Indo-Pakistani relations issue, put on a show of impartiality and justice, which is entirely deceitful. In reality, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have consistently supported and backed Indian expansionists, bullied Pakistan, and harmed Pakistan's independence and sovereignty. The so-called Indo-Pakistani "unity," as pointed out by the *Pakistan Times*, is to force Pakistan to "follow the U.S.-Soviet line" and "unite" with India, which in reality is to demand that Pakistan not only forget Kashmir but also follow India in opposing China, thereby making "Pakistan no longer an independent sovereign state." This exposes the plot of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in pushing for Indo-Pakistani "unity."

The Indian reactionaries, by being anti-China, have received rewards from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, establishing a counter-revolutionary armed force and bullying neighboring countries at will. For many years, they have occupied Kashmir and repeatedly launched armed provocations and wars of aggression against Pakistan, even arrogantly attempting to annex East Pakistan. To defend its national sovereignty and independence, Pakistan has been fighting a long-term struggle against Indian expansionism. The U.S. and the Soviet Union's support for the Indian reactionaries in launching armed invasions and various subversive activities has not been able to defeat Pakistan. The Soviet revisionist leadership's so-called "Tashkent spirit" has also failed. Now, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are conspiring again to plot the trick of Indo-Pakistani "unity." The magic tricks change endlessly, but the essence remains the same: to support the Indian reactionaries, oppress Pakistan, and oppose China.

To be anti-China or to be anti-imperialist, these are two policies that are as incompatible as fire and water. For the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this essentially comes down to whether they are willing to be slaves and vassals of U.S. imperialism or to defend national independence. The Soviet revisionist leadership is hastening to collude with U.S. imperialism in its anti-China activities. In the Indo-Pakistani relations issue, it is similarly following the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism, using various deceptive tactics. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership's despicable activities can only further expose its shameful role as an accomplice to U.S. aggression. All countries that truly seek to defend national independence will not be fooled.

    美苏勾结的一个卑鄙阴谋
    本报评论员
    最近以来，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团在印巴关系上大作文章。它们连续抛出什么克什米尔问题谈判方案，什么印巴建立“合营企业”的主张，什么“印巴双方裁减军备”的建议，等等。花样层出不穷，目的无非是诱迫巴基斯坦放弃独立自主的外交政策，同印度反动派结成反华联盟。这是美苏策划在亚洲建立反华包围圈的一个阴谋。
    美帝和苏修在亚洲建立反华包围圈，目的有两个方面。一方面，它们的确是要对中国实行战略包围，确实是准备对中国发动军事挑衅。但另一方面，它们也是在反华烟幕的掩盖下，控制和侵略中国周围的国家。那些被拉入反华包围圈的国家，将首先使自己受到这种祸害。
    印度国大党反动政府反华最卖力气，是美苏反革命联盟的一个最疯狂、最忠实的走狗。它出卖印度的民族利益，依靠美帝、苏修的支撑和“援助”，维持其反动统治。它的内外政策完全听命于美帝。它在亚非国家中极其孤立，国际地位一落千丈。它在国内弄得民穷财尽，饿殍遍野，广大的劳动人民已经活不下去了。印度反动派充当美帝苏修的打手，反华反了几年，没有损伤中国一根毫毛。但是，国大党政府这种反动政策，却进一步使印度这样一个大国，实际上沦于殖民地的地位。
    巴基斯坦政府实行独立自主的对外政策，积极维护同中国的友好关系，努力促进亚非国家的团结。这种政策是符合巴基斯坦民族利益的。这种政策也使巴基斯坦在国际上得到了真诚的友谊和支持，在亚非国家中具有良好的声誉。
    美帝和苏修在印巴关系问题上，装出一副不偏不倚的公正姿态，这完全是骗人的。美帝和苏修实际上是一贯扶植和支持印度扩张主义者，欺侮巴基斯坦，损害巴基斯坦的独立和主权。所谓印巴“联合”，正如《巴基斯坦时报》所指出的，就是硬要巴基斯坦“遵循美苏方针”同印度“联合”，这实际上是“要求巴基斯坦不仅忘掉克什米尔，而且追随印度对抗中国”，从而使“巴基斯坦不再是一个独立的主权国家”。这就一针见血地揭穿了美苏勾结大搞印巴“联合”的阴谋。
    印度反动派靠反华得到美帝苏修的犒赏，建立了一支反革命武装力量，肆意欺凌它的邻国。它多年来霸占着克什米尔，不断对巴基斯坦发动武装挑衅和侵略战争，甚至狂妄地企图吞并东巴基斯坦。巴基斯坦为维护国家主权和民族独立，同印度扩张主义进行了长期的斗争。美帝和苏修支持印度反动派发动武装侵略和进行种种颠覆活动，都没有能够压倒巴基斯坦。苏修领导集团搞的什么“塔什干精神”，也遭到了破产。现在，美帝和苏修又勾结起来策划印巴“联合”的诡计。戏法变来变去，万变不离其宗，无非就是扶植印度反动派，压迫巴基斯坦，反对中国。
    反华还是反帝，这是两种水火不能相容的政策。对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的国家来说，这实质上就是甘心充当美帝的奴仆和附庸，还是维护民族独立的问题。苏修领导集团加紧勾结美帝国主义进行反华，它在印巴关系问题上同样紧跟美帝国主义的罪恶意图，玩弄了种种欺骗手法。但是，苏修领导集团的这些卑劣活动，只能更加暴露它作为美帝侵略帮凶的可耻面目。一切真正要求维护民族独立的国家，是绝不会上当的。
