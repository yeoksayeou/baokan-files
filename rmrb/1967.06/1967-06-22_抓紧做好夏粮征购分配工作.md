	Now, the countryside across the nation is busy with summer harvesting and planting. While various places are vigorously pushing forward summer harvesting and planting, they must also strive to do a good job in the procurement and distribution of summer grain and oil.

	Doing a good job in this year's summer grain and oil procurement and distribution is an important political task. It will have a significant impact on consolidating the collective economy, supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and socialist construction.

	The fundamental key to doing a good job in summer grain and oil procurement and distribution is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to arm the rural proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants with Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the matter of distribution, we must take into consideration the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. The relations between state revenues, the accumulation of the cooperative, and the personal income of the peasants must be properly handled, and the contradictions among them must be constantly adjusted."

	The rural proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants must be models in correctly handling the relations among these three aspects. They must put the public interest first, regard supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction, and supporting the revolutionary people of the world as their lofty revolutionary responsibility, and resolutely carry out the policies of the Party and the state to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the procurement tasks.

	At present, in some places, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and social elements of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are attempting to take advantage of the summer harvest distribution to spread counter-revolutionary economism under the pretext of "caring for the lives of the members." Their aim is to sabotage the collective economy, state socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and resolutely strike back against the enemy's sabotage activities.

	Leading organs at all levels must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic line of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, and in accordance with the policies of the Party and the state, seriously consult with the masses, reasonably adjust the procurement tasks, and properly arrange the lives of the members. The financial and commercial departments must promptly transport industrial goods to the countryside to supply the needs of the peasants and better promote the development of agricultural production.

	This summer, there is a bumper harvest of grain. Various places must pay special attention to propaganda on planned use of grain and saving grain to prevent waste.

    抓紧做好夏粮征购分配工作
    本报评论员
    现在，全国农村正在紧张地进行夏收、夏种工作。各地在大力抓紧夏收、夏种的同时，还必须努力做好夏季粮食、油料的征购和分配工作。
    搞好今年的夏季粮油征购和分配，是一项重要的政治任务。它对于巩固集体经济，支援无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设，都将发生重大的作用。
    做好夏季粮油征购和分配工作的根本关键，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想去武装农村的无产阶级革命派和广大的贫下中农。
    毛主席教导我们：“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益。对于国家的税收、合作社的积累、农民的个人收入这三方面的关系，必须处理适当，经常注意调节其中的矛盾。”
    农村的无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农，要做正确处理这三者关系的模范，公字当头，把支援无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设，支援世界革命人民，当做自己崇高的革命责任，坚决贯彻党和国家的政策，保证完成和超额完成征购任务。
      当前，在有些地区，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的地富反坏右分子，妄图趁夏收分配的机会，打着“关心社员生活”的旗号，大搞反革命经济主义，以达到破坏集体经济、国家社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。对于阶级敌人的破坏活动，我们必须提高革命警惕，坚决予以打击。
    各级领导部门要根据毛主席关于备战、备荒、为人民的伟大战略方针，根据党和国家的政策，认真同群众商量，合理调整征购任务，妥善安排社员生活。财贸部门要及时调运工业品下乡，供应农民需要，更好地促进农业生产的发展。
    今年夏粮大丰收，各地要特别注意宣传计划用粮，节约用粮，防止浪费。
