Recently, many grassroots units in the Xi'an region have achieved revolutionary unity and have successively established revolutionary committees within their units. To celebrate the establishment of the revolutionary committees, grand celebration meetings are generally held, with banners and gifts exchanged, and parades organized, and so on. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is commendable, and their joyful mood is understandable. However, large-scale celebration activities and the mutual exchange of gifts and banquets have resulted in a considerable waste of manpower and resources. Currently, it is the peak of the summer harvest season, and Shaanxi Province has a good harvest this year. The countryside urgently needs labor, and it is even more inappropriate to hold large-scale mass celebration meetings at this time.

In response to Chairman Mao's call to "be thrifty and make revolution," we suggest that in the future, when grassroots units establish revolutionary committees or conduct other celebration activities, they should not hastily organize large-scale celebration gatherings, and should not exchange gifts or banquets with each other. We, the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat, should establish a new revolutionary ethos of thrift and frugality.

    农忙期间少开庆祝大会
    革命组织之间不要相互送礼请客
    最近，西安地区有不少基层单位实现了革命的大联合，相继成立了本单位的革命委员会。为了庆祝革命委员会的成立，一般都举行了盛大的庆祝大会，互相赠送锦旗，礼品，还举行游行，等等。群众的这种革命热情是可贵的，他们这种欢乐心情也是可以理解的，但是，大规模的庆祝活动和互相赠送礼物、请客，却造成了相当大的人力物力的浪费。现在正是夏收大忙季节，陕西地区今年收成很好，农村迫切需要劳动力，更不宜多召开这种大规模的群众庆祝大会。
    为了响应毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，我们建议，今后各基层单位成立革命委员会或进行其它庆祝活动的时候，不要动不动就搞大规模的庆祝集会，更不要相互送礼、请客。我们无产阶级革命派，应当树立勤俭节约的革命的新风尚。
