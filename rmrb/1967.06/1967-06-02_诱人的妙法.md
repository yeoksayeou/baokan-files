Graduates of the Agricultural Academy do not want to go to the countryside. Every year, a considerable number of agronomists and livestock specialists are sent to Dubossary, but more people leave than arrive. What to do? Many methods have been tried, but with little success. The district Party committee introduced a new method to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Moldavian Republic. Thus, many chairmen of collective farms, dressed smartly, all headed to the Kishinev Agricultural Academy. A chairman of a collective farm said to a young man: "Think about it, we have a place for mechanical engineers to show their skills. There are forty-three tractors alone! Repair base? By autumn, we will have our own workshop. Housing? Dear friend, not only housing, but I will even find you a fiancée!"

The students and the chairmen of the collective farms talked and clarified how much the salary is and what the cultural and living conditions are.

The collective farm "Fruit Donbass" immediately persuaded three senior students, and both parties signed a contract. The students promised to work in this collective farm for at least three years after graduation, and the collective farm promised to create all necessary conditions for the young specialists and immediately took on the responsibility of providing these students with a stipend—each receiving 80 rubles per month.

    诱人的妙法
    农学院的毕业生，谁也不愿到农村里去。每年派往杜鲍萨拉的农艺师和畜牧师不算少，但是离开的人更多。怎么办？很多办法都用过了，就是不大灵。党的区委会向摩尔达维亚共和国农业部介绍了一个新办法。于是，许多集体农庄主席打扮得漂漂亮亮地一齐前往基什尼奥夫农学院。一个农庄主席向一个小伙子说：“你考虑考虑，我们那儿可有机械工程师大显身手的地方呀。仅仅拖拉机就有四十三台！修配基地吗？到秋天就将有自己的工场啦。住房？亲爱的，不光是住房，连未婚妻我都给你找到！”
    大学生们和农庄主席谈了话，弄清工资多少，文化和生活条件如何。
    “水果顿巴斯”集体农庄立刻说服了三个高年级学生，双方签订了合同。大学生保证毕业后在这个农庄至少工作三年，农庄保证给年轻专家们创造一切必要的条件，并立即给这些学生承担了助学金——每人每月高达八十卢布……。
