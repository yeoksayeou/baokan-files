**Editor's Note from the Liberation Army Daily:** Yesterday, our newspaper published "Correctly Handling Two Types of Contradictions, Firmly Grasping the Direction of Struggle" by the Red Revolutionary Alliance of the Navy Headquarters. Today, we publish "Correctly Handling Two Types of Differently Natured Authorities" by the Red Vanguard of the Air Force Headquarters. Both articles discuss how to view two types of authorities, two types of "revolution," and two types of "protection" from the perspective of class analysis. This is a topic worthy of our serious study.

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reached a critical moment of decisive struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are in sharp confrontation, and the lines are clearly drawn. You are either on the side of the proletariat or on the side of the bourgeoisie, and this is not something that can be changed by one's will.

The attitude towards the two types of authorities is the same. Whether you oppose or support the proletarian authorities, whether you revolutionize or protect them; whether you support or oppose the bourgeois authorities, whether you protect or revolutionize them. This is a question that everyone must seriously consider.

If you are a genuine proletarian revolutionary, you will inevitably firmly support and protect the people of the proletarian headquarters, the proletarian authorities. Criticizing their shortcomings and errors will inevitably be done in a comradely manner. Towards the people of the bourgeois headquarters, towards the authorities who take the capitalist road, you will inevitably firmly revolutionize them, overthrow some, and half-overthrow others.

If you are a bourgeois conservative, you will inevitably protect the people of the bourgeois headquarters, protect the authorities who take the capitalist road, and inevitably attack the proletarian headquarters and fiercely oppose the proletarian authorities.

If you are an anarchist, you will inevitably doubt everything, overthrow everything, without distinguishing between the people of the proletarian headquarters and the people of the bourgeois headquarters, without distinguishing between the proletarian authorities and the authorities who take the capitalist road, without asking who is right or wrong, you will overthrow everyone indiscriminately. These people think they are the most thorough "revolutionaries," but in reality, they direct their struggle towards the proletarian authorities, weakening and even destroying the proletarian dictatorship, protecting a handful of authorities who take the capitalist road. This is fundamentally against Mao Zedong Thought.

How to handle the two types of authorities, two types of revolution, and two types of protection, ultimately, is a matter of stance. It is a matter of where your butt is sitting. Are you sitting on the side of the proletariat or the side of the bourgeoisie?

We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: to use the perspective of class and class struggle, to use the method of class analysis to view and analyze everything.

In the socialist society, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a decisive struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. In this extremely sharp and complex struggle, Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" guides us to correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions, to clarify the enemy and the friend, and to clearly understand the direction of struggle, providing us with the sharpest ideological weapon.

Chairman Mao teaches: "In front of us, there are two types of social contradictions, namely, the contradictions between the enemy and us, and the contradictions among the people. These are two types of contradictions with completely different natures." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how can we distinguish these two types of contradictions with completely different natures? Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's teachings on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, we have come to understand the current situation of classes and class struggle in our country, which has new characteristics. Today, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the danger of capitalist restoration mainly comes from the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the organs of proletarian dictatorship, from a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road. The contradiction between the proletariat and this handful of authorities who take the capitalist road is the main contradiction in socialist society. This is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between two classes and two lines. A handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road are the main objects of revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

To distinguish between proletarian authorities and authorities who take the capitalist road, we must use whether they support our great leader Chairman Mao, whether they support Mao Zedong Thought, and whether they insist on taking the socialist road as the most fundamental political standard.

Authorities come in various forms, but if we analyze them from the perspective of class and class struggle, it is not difficult to see: one type is the proletarian authorities, and the other type is the authorities who take the capitalist road. The former are in the majority; they are political representatives of the proletariat, servants of the people. Some of them may have various shortcomings and errors, but these are internal contradictions among the people; the latter are only a handful; they are our enemies. Our contradictions with them are contradictions between the enemy and us. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The methods of resolving the two types of contradictions with different natures are also different." For a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road, we must dare to overthrow them, dare to rebel against them, and firmly overthrow them; for the proletarian authorities, we must dare to protect them, dare to support them, and dare to unite with them.

Chairman Mao says: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." "Love" and "hatred" have class characteristics, and "revolution" and "protection" also have strong class characteristics. We overthrow a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road because they "are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, changing the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship." We support and protect the proletarian authorities because they support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, and insist on taking the socialist road. They have the same goals and interests as us, the proletarian revolutionaries. We should protect them. Overthrowing a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road and protecting the proletarian authorities are both for the protection of the party and the people's interests, for the maintenance of the proletarian dictatorship, so that our power is always in the hands of those who are loyal to the party, loyal to the people, loyal to Chairman Mao, and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, always in the hands of the proletariat. This is to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Mao Zedong Thought. We support and protect the proletarian authorities also to better revolutionize and more powerfully revolutionize. Therefore, our protection is righteous and justified, and it can withstand the test of struggle. It is completely opposite to those conservatives who protect a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line. We support and protect the proletarian authorities, supporting and protecting their revolutionary and correct aspects, not protecting their shortcomings and errors. We also criticize and educate them for their shortcomings and errors, but we insist on handling them according to Chairman Mao's principles for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao says: "The shortcomings of the people need to be criticized, ... but it must be done from the standpoint of the people, with the fervent enthusiasm of protecting and educating the people. If you treat comrades as enemies, you have put yourself on the enemy's side." We criticize them precisely to protect them, to save them, and to prevent them from becoming revisionists.

Daring to revolutionize and daring to protect these two aspects, the most important and fundamental thing is to dare to revolutionize. Chairman Mao teaches: "The thousands of principles of Marxism boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" The main problem that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution wants to solve is to expose a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road, to expose their revisionist goods, to thoroughly criticize them, to make them stink, to make them collapse, to make them fall, and to carry out the struggle for power. This is the direction of the struggle. Only by overthrowing a handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road and thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line can we effectively defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and defend the proletarian dictatorship. Only by fiercely striking down a handful can we truly unite a large number. If we do not dare to revolutionize, do not dare to rebel, and do not overthrow the largest handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road, allowing their counter-revolutionary restoration plot to succeed, then, as Chairman Mao points out: "A Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." Therefore, in daring to revolutionize and daring to protect these two aspects, the main aspect of the contradiction is daring to revolutionize. Because we have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, dared to struggle, dared to rebel, and always insisted on the direction of struggle, we have directed our spears at the largest handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road, at a handful of authorities within the air force leadership who take the capitalist road, achieving major victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; at the same time, according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," we have seriously criticized those proletarian authorities in our place who have certain shortcomings and errors, helping them to correct their shortcomings and errors, and uniting with them on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought to jointly fight against the enemy.

We, the proletarian revolutionaries, have the problem of revolutionizing and protecting. Every mass organization actually has the problem of opposing what and supporting what. A mass organization that is purely revolutionary without protection or purely protective without revolution actually does not exist. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a decisive struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, every mass organization, in this struggle, if it does not stand on the side of the proletariat, socialism, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, it will actually stand on the side of the bourgeoisie, capitalism, and the bourgeois reactionary line. "Sitting on the fence is not allowed, there is no third road." Fundamentally, the broad masses will definitely stand on the side of the proletariat, socialism, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the direction of the broad masses' struggle will always be correct. If you doubt this, you will make a big mistake. However, due to the fact that the largest handful of authorities within the party who take the capitalist road propose and promote the bourgeois reactionary line, and due to the fact that "correct and incorrect things often need time to test," some mass organizations may, at certain times or on certain issues, also direct the spearhead of struggle in the wrong direction, mistaking internal contradictions among the people for contradictions between the enemy and us, or mistaking contradictions between the enemy and us for internal contradictions among the people, injuring good people and letting bad people escape. Although this phenomenon is only partial and temporary, the masses who are deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line will eventually realize it and correct their direction of struggle, but this phenomenon should always be avoided as much as possible. If it occurs, it should be corrected as soon as possible. Because, when you oppose the proletarian authorities or mistakenly treat bad people as good people, you objectively support or protect the authorities who take the capitalist road. Some conservative organizations, although they may also appear in extremely "leftist" or anarchist forms, are not really "doubting everything," "denying everything," "overthrowing everything." In essence, they strike down a large number and protect a handful. In the situation where Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is dominant and has achieved decisive victory, this extremely "leftist" and anarchist tendency actually directs the spearhead at the proletarian authorities and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, protecting the authorities who take the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line. Whether you are aware of this or not, it is actually the case. This is the objective law of class struggle, which is not subject to human will.

In summary, correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions with different natures, daring to struggle and rebel against the authorities who take the capitalist road, thoroughly overthrowing them; daring to protect and support the proletarian authorities, uniting with them. To be able to do this, the key is a "dare" and the essence is a "public" spirit. Only by being selfless can one be fearless, and only by being greatly public-spirited can one be greatly courageous. With personal or small-group narrow prejudices, one cannot correctly recognize or accurately grasp the enemy-friend boundary and the standard of right and wrong. Therefore, in the struggle, insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, treating oneself as a force of the revolution and also as an object of the revolution, greatly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, greatly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and greatly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental guarantee for correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions with different natures and insisting on the direction of struggle.

    正确对待两种不同性质的当权派	人民解放军空军司令部　红尖兵
    《解放军报》编者按：　昨天本报发表了海军直属机关红联总《正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争大方向》，今天又发表了空军司令部红尖兵《正确对待两种不同性质的当权派》。这两篇文章都提出了怎样用阶级分析的观点来看待两种性质的当权派，两种性质的“革”，两种性质的“保”的问题。这个问题很值得我们大家认真研究。
    当前无产阶级文化大革命已进入到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，尖锐对立，阵营分明。你不是站在无产阶级一边，就是站在资产阶级一边，这是不以人们意志为转移的。
    对待两种当权派的态度也是这样。你对待无产阶级当权派，是反对还是拥护，是革还是保；对资产阶级当权派，是拥护还是反对，是保还是革。这是摆在每个人的面前，必须认真抉择的问题。
    你是真正的无产阶级革命派，对待无产阶级司令部的人，对待无产阶级当权派，你就必然坚决拥护，坚决保，统统保。对他们的缺点、错误的批评，也必然是同志式的。对待资产阶级司令部的人，对待走资本主义道路的当权派，你就必然坚决革，有的要打倒，有的半打倒。
    你是资产阶级保皇派，你就必然保资产阶级司令部的人，保走资本主义道路的当权派，必然炮打无产阶级司令部，必然拚命地反对无产阶级当权派。
    你是无政府主义者，你就必然怀疑一切，打倒一切，不分无产阶级司令部的人还是资产阶级司令部的人，不分无产阶级当权派还是走资本主义道路的当权派，不问青红皂白，一概打倒。这些人自以为是最彻底的“革命派”，其实，他们把斗争矛头指向无产阶级当权派，就削弱以至破坏无产阶级专政，保护一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是根本违背毛泽东思想的。
    如何对待两种当权派、两种革两种保的问题，归根到底，是个立场问题。是屁股坐在那一边的问题。是坐在无产阶级一边，还是坐在资产阶级一边。
    我们必须牢记毛主席的教导：要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切、分析一切。
    在社会主义社会中所进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的大决战。在这场极其尖锐复杂的斗争中，伟大领袖毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇伟大著作，指导我们正确地区分两类不同性质的矛盾，分清敌我，明确斗争大方向，给了我们最锐利的思想武器。
    毛主席教导说：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，怎样才能分清这两类性质完全不同的矛盾呢？通过反复学习毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的教导，使我们认识到我国当前的阶级和阶级斗争情况，出现了新的特点。今天，在无产阶级专政条件下，资本主义复辟的危险，主要来自混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。无产阶级同这一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是社会主义社会里的主要矛盾。这是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的集中表现。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象。
    区分无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路的当权派，必须以是否拥护我们的伟大领袖毛主席，是否拥护毛泽东思想，是否坚持走社会主义道路作为最根本的政治标准。
    当权派有各种各样，但用阶级、阶级斗争观点加以分析，就不难看出：一类是无产阶级当权派，另一类是走资本主义道路的当权派。前者占大多数，他们是无产阶级的政治代表，是人民的勤务员，他们当中的一些人也会有这样那样的缺点错误，但是，这是属于人民内部的矛盾；后者只是一小撮，他们是我们的敌人，我们同他们的矛盾是敌我矛盾。毛主席教导我们：“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。”对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们要敢革他们的命，敢造他们的反，坚决把他们打倒；对于无产阶级当权派，我们要敢于保护他们，敢于支持他们，敢于团结他们。
    毛主席说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”“爱”和“恨”有阶级性，“革”和“保”也有强烈的阶级性。我们打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，因为他们“是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”我们支持和保护无产阶级当权派，因为他们是拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，坚持走社会主义道路的。他们同我们无产阶级革命派有共同的目的，共同的利益。我们应该保护他们。革党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命，保无产阶级当权派，都是为了保护党和人民的利益，维护无产阶级专政，使我们的政权永远掌握在忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的人的手里，永远掌握在无产阶级手里，是保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫毛泽东思想。我们支持和保护无产阶级当权派，也是为了更好地革，更有力地革。所以我们这种保是正大光明的，理直气壮的，是经得起斗争考验的，和那些保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线的保守派，是完全相反的。我们支持和保护无产阶级当权派，是支持和保护他们革命的正确的方面，不是保他们的缺点、错误。对他们的缺点、错误也进行批评教育，但是我们坚持按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则办事。毛主席说：“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的，……但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话。如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”我们批评他们也正是为了保护他们，挽救他们，防止他们变成修正主义。
    敢革和敢保这样两个方面，最主要最根本的是要敢革。毛主席教导说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要问题，就是把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭露出来，把他们那套修正主义货色拿出来示众，彻底批判，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，对他们进行夺权斗争。这是斗争的大方向。只有打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，才能有效地保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级专政。只有狠狠地打击一小撮，才能真正地团结一大片。我们如果不敢革命，不敢造反，不把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打倒，让他们的反革命复辟的阴谋得逞，那就会象毛主席指出的那样：“马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”所以，敢革敢保这两个方面，矛盾的主要方面是敢革。我们由于坚决贯彻执行了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，敢于斗争，敢于造反，始终坚持了斗争大方向，把矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，指向空军领导机关中党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的重大胜利；同时，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式，对我们那里犯有某种缺点、错误的无产阶级当权派进行了认真的批评，帮助他们改正缺点错误，在毛泽东思想的基础上同他们团结起来，共同对敌。
    我们无产阶级革命派有革和保的问题，每一个群众组织实际上都有个反对什么和拥护什么的问题。单纯的只反不保或只保不反的群众组织实际上是不存在的。无产阶级文化大革命既然是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，每一个群众组织，在这场斗争中不站在无产阶级、社会主义和毛主席的革命路线一边，实际上就会站在资产阶级、资本主义和资产阶级反动路线一边。“骑墙是不行的，第三条道路是没有的。”从根本上来说，广大群众肯定是站在无产阶级、社会主义和毛主席革命路线一边，广大群众的斗争大方向始终是正确的。如果怀疑这一点，就要犯大错误。但是，由于党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派提出和推行资产阶级反动路线，由于“判断正确的东西和错误的东西，常常需要有考验的时间”，某些群众组织在某个时候或某些问题上，也可能把斗争的矛头指向错误的方向，把人民内部矛盾错当成敌我矛盾，或者把敌我矛盾错当成人民内部矛盾，误伤好人，放跑坏人。这种现象虽然只是局部的、暂时的，受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众终究会明白过来，端正自己的斗争大方向，但是，这种现象，总是应该极力避免的。如果发生了也应当尽快地改正。因为，当你反对无产阶级当权派或错把坏人当好人的时候，在客观上就支持或保护了走资本主义道路的当权派。有些保守组织，虽然也可能以极“左”的或无政府主义的面目出现，也并不是真的“怀疑一切”，“否定一切”，“打倒一切”，实质上是打击一大片，保护一小撮。在毛主席革命路线占统治地位和取得决定性胜利的情况下，这种极“左”的和无政府主义的倾向，实际上是把矛头指向了无产阶级当权派和毛主席的革命路线，保护了走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线。不管你是否意识到这一点，实际上就是如此。这是阶级斗争的客观规律，是不以人的意志为转移的。
    总起来说，正确地区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾这两类不同性质的矛盾，对走资本主义道路当权派敢斗，敢造反，把他们彻底打倒；对无产阶级当权派敢保，敢支持，和他们团结起来。要能做到这样，中心是一个“敢”字，实质是一个“公”字。无私才能无畏，大公才能大勇。带上个人或小团体的狭隘偏见，既不能正确地认识，也不能准确地把握敌我界限和是非标准。因而，在斗争中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，也把自己当作革命的对象，大立毛主席的绝对权威，大立毛主席的革命路线的绝对权威，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是正确地区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，坚持斗争大方向的根本保证。　（新华社二十四日讯）
