Secret talks continue; dirty deals accelerate
Kosygin and Johnson inseparable
Both sides conspired on numerous issues including Vietnam and the Middle East

New China News Agency, June 24th: The head of American imperialism, Johnson, and the head of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, Kosygin, held a secret meeting lasting over five hours in a "harmonious" and "serious" atmosphere on the 23rd. They announced that they would continue this black meeting on the 25th to directly plot the revolutionary global alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. After the meeting on the 23rd, Johnson emphasized that he thought "today's meeting was a very good and very beneficial meeting," which helped to increase "mutual affection." Kosygin then said, "Johnson is right."

On the 23rd, Johnson led a large delegation of American military and political figures, including Secretary of State Rusk and Secretary of Defense McNamara, to Glassboro in New Jersey, halfway between Washington and New York, to meet with Kosygin. That morning and afternoon, Johnson and Kosygin held two separate meetings with only interpreters present. During lunch, they continued their talks. While Johnson and Kosygin were meeting privately, Rusk and others met with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko in another room for a long private discussion.

Kosygin, who is eager to conduct a global deal with American imperialism, said to reporters after the meeting, "We have gathered a large number of issues that we cannot discuss today, so we decided to meet again on Sunday (the 25th)." According to a White House spokesman, it was Kosygin who first proposed continuing the talks, and Johnson "immediately accepted the suggestion," expressing his "willingness" to talk again.

Johnson announced that both the U.S. and the Soviet Union agreed that after his direct talks with Kosygin, Rusk and Gromyko would continue their talks in New York the following week.

This unprecedented and blatant global deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union aims to strengthen their comprehensive anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary alliance and to intensify the suppression of the surging revolutionary struggles of the people around the world. According to Johnson, the specific issues discussed in this U.S.-Soviet meeting include: the Vietnam issue, the Middle East issue, "preventing nuclear proliferation," establishing an "anti-ballistic missile system," "situations in Southeast Asia," and "issues of common interest in Europe and the Western Hemisphere," as well as "direct bilateral relations between the Soviet Union and the U.S."

Various sources have revealed that on these issues, the criminal dealings between Kosygin and Johnson are actually accelerating.

The first target of the U.S.-Soviet counter-revolutionary alliance is China. After China's recent successful hydrogen bomb test, American newspapers have been shouting that the closer U.S.-Soviet collusion against China is the "most urgent issue" and the "greatest common interest" of the U.S.-Soviet summit talks.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding on the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation" and related issues of establishing an "anti-ballistic missile system," which are directly aimed at China. Johnson emphasized after the meeting on the 23rd that he and Kosygin "agreed that it is very important to reach an international agreement on a non-proliferation treaty now." A White House spokesman also said that Rusk expressed hope that the draft being discussed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union on this issue would soon be submitted to the Geneva Disarmament Conference. He revealed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have already reached "sufficient understanding" on this matter. This White House spokesman also said that the issue of establishing an "anti-ballistic missile system" was "seriously discussed" at the lunch table between Johnson and Kosygin.

The further collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue obviously occupies an important position in the talks between Johnson and Kosygin. According to the United Press International, Kosygin "is more willing to discuss the Vietnam War with (Johnson) the President." Although the White House spokesman refused to reveal the details of the discussions on the Vietnam issue, Johnson and Kosygin's public speeches on the 19th, advocating the "gradual de-escalation" of the Vietnam War and "stopping the bombing first," have already shown that they are continuing to play tricks with the "war for peace" and "stopping the bombing for peace" conspiracies.

The revealed discussions on the Middle East issue show that Kosygin, who went to the U.S. under the pretext of "supporting" Arab countries, will continue to follow the U.S. and force the Arab people to submit to the American and Israeli aggressors. According to the White House spokesman, Rusk and Gromyko discussed Johnson's "five principles" for solving the Middle East issue, which were proposed in his speech on the 19th to pressure the Arab people to surrender. Both sides have reached an understanding that Israel should "exist as a state." Johnson then publicly praised the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for its "contribution" in cooperating with the U.S. to force Arab countries to accept the "ceasefire" issue, encouraging the Soviet revisionist leadership clique to continue to act as a henchman for American imperialism's aggression against Arab countries.

Kosygin also openly echoed Johnson, advocating that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should jointly suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people around the world to achieve the "world peace" that American imperialism needs. In his speech at the lunch table, Johnson, targeting the Soviet revisionist clique's dream of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world," boasted that the U.S. and the Soviet Union "have a special position in this world and bear special responsibilities," and therefore the heads of the U.S. and the Soviet Union should discuss "peace issues affecting the entire human family of three billion people." Kosygin, when leaving Glassboro, also repeatedly declared that he "came to the U.S. on a peace mission," that the Soviet revisionists want to "live in peace with the U.S. imperialists," and that wars should be stopped everywhere in the world, "war should become a thing of the past everywhere in the world." This exposes that Kosygin's words of "supporting" the Arab people at the United Nations are all false, and that he is truly currying favor with the U.S. imperialists, using the betrayal of the interests of the revolutionary people of the world to beg for "peace" from the U.S. imperialists.

To complete various deals of betraying the interests of the revolutionary people of the world with the head of American imperialism, Kosygin was obsequious and flattering when he met Johnson. According to Western news agencies, Kosygin, upon seeing Johnson on the 23rd, "smiled and shook hands warmly," flattered Johnson for "choosing a good place (for the meeting)," and congratulated Johnson on the birth of a new grandson. The two shook hands for half a minute. When Kosygin followed Johnson into the meeting place, they "continued to smile and shake hands." When the meeting ended, Kosygin and Johnson "left the venue hand in hand," Johnson "smiling broadly," while "Kosygin grinned," and when they parted, the warmth of their handshake was the same as when they met.

Kosygin, in front of the head of American imperialism, was so intimate and uninhibited, so respectful and flattering, fully exposing the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique as the number one henchman of American imperialism and the great traitor to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world. Kosygin personally led a large delegation to the U.S. to seek an audience and conduct a new round of talks to make a revolutionary deal of unprecedented scale for "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world."

### 秘密会谈再接再厉　肮脏交易加紧成交  柯西金同约翰逊难舍难分  双方对越南问题、中东问题等许许多多问题都进行了密谋

    秘密会谈再接再厉　肮脏交易加紧成交
    柯西金同约翰逊难舍难分
    双方对越南问题、中东问题等许许多多问题都进行了密谋
    新华社二十四日讯  美帝国主义头子约翰逊同苏联修正主义领导集团头目柯西金二十三日在“融洽的”和“认真的”气氛中举行了长达五个多小时的秘密会谈，并且宣布将在二十五日继续举行这种黑会，来直接策划美苏的反革命全球性大勾结。二十三日会谈后，约翰逊强调表示，他认为“今天的这次会见是一次非常好、非常有益的会见”，有助于增进“彼此的喜爱”，柯西金接着说，他认为约翰逊“说得很对”。
    二十三日，约翰逊带领了美国国务卿腊斯克、国防部长麦克纳马拉等大批美国军政要员，到华盛顿和纽约中途的新泽西州葛拉斯堡罗同柯西金会合。当天上午和下午，约翰逊同柯西金接连举行只有译员参加的两次单独会谈。双方在午餐时，也继续会谈。在约翰逊同柯西金单独会谈的同时，腊斯克等同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯等在另外一间房子里举行了长时间的密谈。
    急于同美帝国主义进行全球性大交易的柯西金，在会谈结束后对记者说，“我们汇集了大量的问题，无法在今天讨论完，因此我们决定在星期日（二十五日）再次会见。”据美国白宫发言人透露，首先主动提出继续会谈的，是柯西金，而约翰逊“马上接受了这个建议”，表示他“也非常愿意”再谈一次。
    约翰逊宣布，美苏双方一致同意，在约翰逊同柯西金直接会谈以后，腊斯克同葛罗米柯下星期还要在纽约继续会谈。
    这次美苏之间空前露骨、空前广泛的全球性大交易，目的在于加强美苏反华、反共、反人民、反革命的全面联盟，加紧镇压风起云涌的世界人民的革命斗争。据约翰逊透露，美苏这次会谈中涉及的具体问题包括：越南问题、中东问题、“防止核扩散”、建立“反弹道导弹系统”、“东南亚局势和在欧洲和西半球共同感兴趣的问题”，以及苏美之间的“直接双边关系”等。
    各方面透露出来的一些情况表明，在这些问题上，柯西金同约翰逊之间的罪恶买卖，实际上正在加紧成交。
    美苏反革命联盟的矛头首先就是指向中国。在中国最近成功地爆炸氢弹以后，美国报纸这些天来一直在大肆叫嚷，美苏更加紧密勾结反华，是美苏这次最高级会谈所要讨论的“最紧迫的问题”，是美苏“最大的共同利益”所在。
    美苏在所谓“防止核扩散”和有关建立“反弹道导弹系统”问题上加紧勾结，就是直接针对中国的。约翰逊在二十三日会谈后强调说，他同柯西金“一致认为，现在就一项不扩散（核武器）条约达成国际协议是很重要的”。美国白宫发言人也说，腊斯克表示希望美苏关于这个问题正在讨论的一个草案，即将向日内瓦裁军会议提出来。他透露，美苏在这方面已经有了“足够的谅解”。这个白宫发言人还说，在约翰逊同柯西金的午餐席上已经“认真讨论”了有关建立“反弹道导弹系统”问题。
    美苏在越南问题上的进一步勾结显然在约翰逊同柯西金会谈中占有重要位置。据合众国际社报道，柯西金“更愿意同（约翰逊）总统会谈越南战争”。尽管美国白宫发言人拒绝透露关于越南问题的讨论情况，但是约翰逊和柯西金在十九日公开发表的演说里，相继鼓吹越南战争“逐步降级”和“首先停炸”，已经表明，他们企图在越南问题上继续玩弄“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。
    已经透露出来的关于中东问题的讨论情况表明，打着“支持”阿拉伯国家的幌子跑到美国去的柯西金，要继续追随美国，迫使阿拉伯人民屈从美、以侵略者。据美国白宫发言人说，腊斯克同葛罗米柯会谈中讨论了约翰逊在十九日的演说中提出的压迫阿拉伯人民屈膝投降的所谓解决中东问题的“五大原则”，双方已经取得谅解，以色列要“作为一个国家存在”。约翰逊则在午餐席上当面夸奖苏修领导集团在伙同美国迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”问题上作出的“贡献”，鼓励苏修领导集团继续充当美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的帮凶。
    柯西金还同约翰逊公开唱和，大肆鼓吹美苏两霸合伙镇压世界人民革命斗争，以实现美帝国主义所需要的那种“世界和平”。约翰逊在午餐席上的讲话中，针对苏修集团“美苏合作主宰世界”的迷梦，大肆宣扬美苏两国“在这个世界上有特殊的地位，而且负有特殊的责任”，因而要由美苏两国首脑来讨论“影响有三十亿人口的整个人类家庭的和平的问题”。而柯西金在离开葛拉斯堡罗时，也一再表白说，他“是到美国来执行和平使命的”，苏修要同美帝“和平相处”，在世界各地都“停止战争”，“战争应该在全世界成为一件过去的事情”。这就道破了柯西金在联合国大会上“支持”阿拉伯人民的花言巧语完全是假的，投靠美帝、用出卖世界革命人民利益来向美帝乞讨“和平”才是真的。
    柯西金为了同美帝头子做成出卖世界人民革命利益的各项买卖，在见到约翰逊时奴颜婢膝，媚态百出。据西方通讯社描绘，柯西金二十三日一见到约翰逊就“含笑相迎，热烈握手”，又是奉承约翰逊“选择了一个很好的（会谈）地点”，又是恭喜约翰逊新添了外孙，两人握手长达半分钟之久。柯西金在跟着约翰逊进入会谈场所时，两人又“继续微笑和握手”。到会谈结束时，柯西金同约翰逊“手挽着手”离开会场，约翰逊“笑容满面”，而“柯西金则咧开嘴唇”，在分别时，两人“握手时的热烈程度就同他们在会谈开始时握手的情况一样”。（附图片）
    柯西金在美帝国主义头子面前，如此亲亲热热，不分彼此，如此毕恭毕敬，吹拍逢迎，淋漓尽致地显示出了苏修领导集团充当美帝国主义的头号帮凶，作为世界人民革命事业的大叛徒的丑恶嘴脸。柯西金亲自率领一个庞大的代表团到美国登门求见，同美帝国主义头子进行一次新的会谈搞空前规模的“苏美合作主宰世界”的反革命交易。图为六月二十三日在葛拉斯堡罗，柯西金（左）同美帝头子约翰逊（右）会谈时交头接耳的一副奴才相。新华社发（传真照片）
