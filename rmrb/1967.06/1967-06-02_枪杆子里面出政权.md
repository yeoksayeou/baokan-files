	Power Comes from the Barrel of a Gun
	Beijing New China Printing Factory Worker Fang Wenjun

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The thousand and one principles of Marxism can be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" The revolutionary ballet "Red Detachment of Women" vividly embodies Chairman Mao's brilliant thought. I watched this ballet and received profound education and great inspiration.

	Wu Qinghua, the daughter of a poor peasant, suffered under the three great mountains of oppression like hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants before liberation. Yet, she possesses the class essence of a proletarian revolutionary—the spirit of rebellion. Look, when Wu Qinghua is tortured by Nan Batian, she does not yield and fights resolutely against the enemy. Just as she is about to be sold, her deep class hatred gives her immense strength. She kicks down the landlord's henchman and breaks out of the landlord's prison. When I saw this, I felt truly exhilarated. Wu Qinghua's rebellion is just and righteous!

	Under the Party's guidance, Wu Qinghua joined the people's armed forces—the Red Detachment of Women. From Wu Qinghua's experience, we see that the oppressed, to achieve thorough liberation, must rise up in rebellion and take up arms to make revolution. "Power comes from the barrel of a gun." "Red Detachment of Women" proves this truth. Under the Party's leadership, the Red Army used their guns to eliminate Nan Batian and liberate the coconut grove. The armed self-defense corps of the coconut grove, fighting alongside the main forces of the Red Army to liberate their hometown, played a significant role.

	I found this performance particularly familiar because I am a revolutionary rebel and also a militiaman. I feel even more spirited in my rebellion, and I deeply realize that we militiamen bear a heavy responsibility. We must follow Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp our guns, defend the revolutionary cause left to us by our predecessors, and keep it forever red!

	During this Cultural Revolution, most of the militiamen in our New China Printing Factory are staunch revolutionary rebels. We responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, rebelled against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. These guys want to change the sky, overthrow proletarian dictatorship, and restore capitalism. To defend proletarian dictatorship, we fought resolutely against them and seized power from their hands. After the revolutionary faction took power, we cut off the black hand of the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party that had reached into the printing and publishing industry. Our New China Printing Factory was reborn and became an important stronghold for spreading the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong to the people of the nation.

	Although we have achieved great victories, we must not relax our vigilance. After watching "Red Detachment of Women," I deeply realized that all class enemies are like Nan Batian and are unwilling to perish. They may be gone, but their spirits live on. We proletarian revolutionaries and militiamen must firmly remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, thoroughly criticize the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and strive for the defense of proletarian dictatorship!

    枪杆子里面出政权
    北京新华印刷厂工人　方文军
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理’。”革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》生动地体现了毛主席这一光辉思想。我看了这个芭蕾舞剧，受到了深刻的教育，得到了巨大的鼓舞。
    吴清华这个贫农的女儿，解放前同中国几亿农民一样受着三座大山的重压，可是在她身上具有无产阶级革命者的阶级本色——造反精神。看吧，吴清华遭受南霸天毒刑拷打时，她毫不屈服，坚决与敌人斗争。就在即将被卖出的时候，刻骨的阶级仇恨，给予她巨大的力量，一脚踢倒地主的狗腿子，冲出地主的牢笼。我看到这儿，真是感到振奋。吴清华造反造得好，造得有理！
    在党的指引下，吴清华参加了人民的武装——红色娘子军。从吴清华的经历，我们看到了受压迫者要求得彻底解放，唯一的道路就是起来造反，拿起枪杆子闹革命。“枪杆子里面出政权。”《红色娘子军》用事实证明了这个真理。在党的领导下，红军用枪杆子消灭了南霸天，解放了椰林寨。椰林寨群众武装赤卫队在解放自己家乡的战斗中，配合红军主力部队作战，发挥了很大的作用。
    我看了这出戏感到特别亲切，因为我是革命造反者，又是民兵。我觉得自己造反的劲头儿更足了，同时也深深感到我们民兵肩负着重任。我们一定要听毛主席的话，紧握枪杆子，保住革命前辈给我们打下的江山，让它永远红彤彤的！
    在这次文化大革命中，我们新华印刷厂的民兵战士大多是坚强的革命造反派。我们响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。这些家伙，就是想变天，想推翻无产阶级专政，想复辟资本主义。为了捍卫无产阶级专政，我们同这些家伙进行了坚决的斗争，从他们的手里夺了权。革命派掌权后，斩断了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派伸进印刷出版界的黑手，我们新华印刷厂新生了，成为向全国人民传播光焰无际的毛泽东思想的重要阵地。
    我们虽然取得了巨大的胜利，但我们决不能松懈自己的斗志。看了《红色娘子军》，我深刻体会到一切阶级敌人都和南霸天一样是不甘心灭亡的。他们人还在，心不死。我们无产阶级革命派、民兵战士，一定要牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席的教导，继续发扬革命造反精神，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为捍卫无产阶级专政而奋斗！
