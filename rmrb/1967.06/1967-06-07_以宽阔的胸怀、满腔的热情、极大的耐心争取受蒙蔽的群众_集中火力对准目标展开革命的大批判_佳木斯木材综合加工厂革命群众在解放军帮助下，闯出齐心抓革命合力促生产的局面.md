The propaganda team of the Black River Military Region of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has assisted the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Jiamusi Comprehensive Wood Processing Plant in taking Mao Zedong's theories, lines, policies, and principles on the Cultural Revolution as their compass, firmly grasping the overall direction of the struggle. With broad-mindedness, fervent enthusiasm, and great patience, they have actively educated and united the deceived masses to return to Mao Zedong's revolutionary line. They have concentrated their firepower on the target, launching a revolutionary criticism, thoroughly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, and unitedly grasping the revolution while jointly promoting production.

The factory has about 2,500 people. When the propaganda team entered the factory in late March, there were about 1,300 revolutionary masses, and another 800 deceived masses. There was a serious confrontation between the revolutionary masses and the deceived masses, who did not approach each other, did not unite in revolution, and did not cooperate in production. The propaganda team believed that solving this problem was a key issue in whether revolutionary great unity could be achieved and whether the struggle, criticism, and transformation could be carried out well. To solve this problem, it was necessary to help the revolutionary masses better grasp Mao Zedong Thought, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and learn the skills of doing ideological and political work. Therefore, the propaganda team members studied with the core members of the revolutionary mass organizations, the broad masses of soldiers, and their families, learning the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Mao Zedong. The "Sixteen Points" pointed out: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution." The propaganda team members guided everyone to discuss this issue and conduct a class analysis of the deceived masses. Everyone understood that the deceived masses were also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. The confrontation between them and the revolutionary masses was entirely caused by the bourgeois reactionary line. The contradiction between the revolutionary masses and the deceived masses was a contradiction within the people, while the contradiction between them and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party was an antagonistic contradiction. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary masses should correctly treat the deceived masses, unite all forces that can be united, and direct all cannons and guns at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the factory.

The propaganda team also guided everyone to learn Mao Zedong's teaching: "We must not stand in an antagonistic position and use the attitude of dealing with enemies to deal with comrades. We must speak with full enthusiasm to protect the cause of the people and raise the awareness of the people, and not with a mocking and attacking attitude." They encouraged everyone to be broad-minded, consider the overall situation, not to look down on the deceived masses, not to ridicule or retaliate against them, but to allow them to join the revolution, welcome them to join the revolution, and help them join the revolution. The proletarian revolutionary masses deepened their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the propaganda team, actively and proactively helped the deceived masses liberate their minds and put down their burdens.

Through a series of painstaking and detailed ideological work, such as studying Mao Zedong's works, leading large meetings, assisting small meetings, having individual heart-to-heart talks, visiting families, recalling bitterness and sweetness, and exposing the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line, the majority of the deceived masses distinguished between enemies and friends, recognized their mistakes, and successively returned to Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, joining the proletarian revolutionary mass organizations and directing the struggle at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. However, a few people, due to being deeply poisoned and having slower awakening, showed no significant change. At this time, some comrades in the proletarian revolutionary masses showed impatience. The propaganda team members, together with them, studied Mao Zedong's teaching: "Our comrades must understand that ideological transformation is a long-term, patient, and detailed task. It is not possible to change people's ideological consciousness, which has formed over several decades of life, by giving a few lectures or holding a few meetings." The proletarian revolutionary masses further understood that a person's recognition of problems has a process, and generally, the process is longer for those deeply poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line, and the detoxification work also takes longer. This process is the process of proletarian ideology overcoming bourgeois ideology and the process of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line overcoming the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary masses must not only organize the deceived masses to come over but, more importantly, must ideologically win them over. They must firmly believe that the deceived masses can become revolutionary masses under the education of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they must, with broad-mindedness, fervent enthusiasm, and great patience, help them catch up with the team, no matter how far behind they are.

The propaganda team, on the one hand, actively inspired and guided, and on the other hand, set an example in action. In Workshop 1, there was a deceived worker who initially could not turn around and did not realize his mistake in choosing sides. The propaganda team members did not rush him to admit his mistake but patiently worked and studied Mao Zedong's works with him, visited his home for heart-to-heart talks, and cared for him when he was sick. This worker had deep bitterness in the old society. The propaganda team members, together with him, recalled bitterness and sweetness, conducted class education on him, and fundamentally raised his class consciousness. They told him: "You love the party and Chairman Mao, but your revolutionary spirit has been used by bad people. They led you to rebel not against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party but against the proletariat, not to protect Chairman Mao but to protect the power-holders taking the capitalist road. You made a mistake in rebelling and protected the wrong person. We should not be afraid of losing face but should be afraid of the country changing color." This deceived worker began to realize his mistake, decided to draw a clear line with the handful of bad people, and later joined the revolutionary mass organization.

The PLA's approach set an example for the proletarian revolutionary masses. They also, with great patience and long-term painstaking and detailed work, helped the deceived masses who were deeply poisoned and had slower awakening to successively return to Mao Zedong's revolutionary line.

When the struggle encountered setbacks, the majority of the deceived masses who had awakened could withstand the test; however, a very few were affected by the reverse current and turned back, announcing their withdrawal from the revolutionary mass organization. Facing this situation, some comrades in the proletarian revolutionary masses acted emotionally, saying: "You were deceived once, and you can be deceived again. Withdrawal is better; the more you withdraw, the purer our ranks will be." The propaganda team members seized this active thought and, together with the revolutionary masses, timely studied Mao Zedong's statements on class struggle and the "Sixteen Points," guiding everyone to understand: the struggle will have setbacks, and doing work among the deceived masses will also have setbacks. One must acknowledge this setback and not fear this setback. The vast majority of comrades in the proletarian revolutionary masses realized: first, the reverse current of capitalist restoration comes from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, not from the deceived masses, and one should not easily blame the deceived masses. Second, class struggle will inevitably be reflected in everyone's mind. Some comrades can see clearly, stand firmly, and resist; some may not see clearly, be deceived, and turn back, which is understandable and not difficult to correct. This setback will enable them to gain experience and lessons, be tempered, and learn to struggle in the struggle. As for some deceived masses who joined the revolutionary mass organization and then withdrew, this shows that the ideological work of the revolutionary masses has not been done thoroughly and has not fulfilled their responsibility.

Therefore, the revolutionary mass comrades adopted a correct attitude towards the masses who withdrew from the revolutionary organization: they did not discriminate against withdrawal, welcomed re-entry, and continued to actively and enthusiastically approach them, doing their ideological work. As a result, many masses who withdrew from the revolutionary mass organization successively joined the revolutionary mass organization again. So far, more than 700 deceived masses have joined the revolutionary mass organization. The entire factory has achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, powerfully launching a great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and achieving double victories in revolution and production.

    以宽阔的胸怀、满腔的热情、极大的耐心争取受蒙蔽的群众
    集中火力对准目标展开革命的大批判
    佳木斯木材综合加工厂革命群众在解放军帮助下，闯出齐心抓革命合力促生产的局面
    本报讯　黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助佳木斯木材综合加工厂的无产阶级革命派，把毛主席关于文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策作为方向盘，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以宽阔的胸怀、满腔的热情、极大的耐心，主动教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，集中火力，对准目标，批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，搞好本单位斗批改，齐心抓革命，合力促生产。
    这个工厂有二千五百人左右。宣传队在三月下旬进厂时，革命派有一千三百多人，另有八百多受蒙蔽的群众。革命派和受蒙蔽的群众之间存在着严重的对立情绪，互相不接近，革命不齐心，生产不合力。宣传队认为，这个问题解决得好不好，是关系到能不能实现革命大联合，能不能搞好斗批改的一个关键问题。要解决这个问题，必须帮助革命派更好地掌握毛泽东思想，严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，学会做思想政治工作的过硬本领。于是，宣传队的同志就分别同革命派组织的核心成员、广大战士和他们的家属，一起学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”。“十六条”指出：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”宣传队同志引导大家围绕这个问题，对受蒙蔽的群众进行了阶级分析。大家了解到，受蒙蔽群众也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。他们和革命派之间的对立，完全是资产阶级反动路线造成的。革命派和受蒙蔽群众之间的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，他们和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是敌我矛盾。因此，无产阶级革命派要正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，把炮口、枪口统统对准党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    宣传队还引导大家学习了毛主席的“不能站在敌对的立场用对待敌人的态度来对待同志。必须是满腔热情地用保护人民事业和提高人民觉悟的态度来说话，而不能用嘲笑和攻击的态度来说话”的教导，要大家识大体，顾大局，对受蒙蔽的群众不另眼看待，不讽刺挖苦，不打击报复；而是要允许他们起来革命，欢迎他们起来革命，帮助他们起来革命。无产阶级革命派加深了对毛泽东思想的领会，就和宣传队一起，积极主动帮助受蒙蔽群众解放思想，放下包袱。
    经过学习毛主席著作，大会引路，小会帮助，个别谈心，走访家庭，忆苦思甜，控诉党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线的罪行等一系列艰苦细致的思想工作，多数受蒙蔽的群众，分清了敌我，认识了错误，纷纷回到毛主席革命路线上来，加入了无产阶级革命派的战斗组织，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。但是，有少数人由于中毒较深，觉悟较慢，没有明显的转变。这时，无产阶级革命派中的一些同志，表现了很不耐烦的态度。宣传队同志又和他们一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”无产阶级革命派进一步懂得，一个人认识问题要有一个过程，受资产阶级反动路线毒害深的，一般来说认识问题的过程要长一些，消毒工作也要长一些。这个过程，也就是无产阶级思想战胜资产阶级思想的过程，是毛主席的革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的过程。无产阶级革命派不仅要从组织上把受蒙蔽的群众争取过来，更重要的是要从思想上把他们争取过来。而且要坚信受蒙蔽的群众是能够在毛泽东思想的教育下变成革命派的。因此，一定要以宽阔的胸怀、满腔的热情、极大的耐心，不管他们掉队多远，都要帮助他们赶上队。
    宣传队一方面积极启发诱导，一方面又在行动上做出样子。一车间有个受蒙蔽的工人，起初老是转不过弯来，认识不到自己站错了队。宣传队的同志没有急于要他认错，而是耐心地跟他一块劳动，一块学习毛主席著作，到他家里谈心，他有病就去看望。这个工人在旧社会是个苦大仇深的人。宣传队同志就和他一起忆苦思甜，对他循循善诱进行阶级教育，从根本上提高他的阶级觉悟。对他说：“你是热爱党、热爱毛主席的，但是你的造反精神被坏人利用了，他们领你造的不是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造的是无产阶级的反，保的不是毛主席，保的是走资本主义道路当权派，造错了反，保错了人。我们不应该怕丢面子，应该怕国家变颜色。”这个受蒙蔽的工人听后开始认识到自己的错误，决心和一小撮坏人划清界限，后来加入了革命派组织。
    解放军的这些做法，给无产阶级革命派树立了榜样。他们也以极大的耐心，长时间的艰苦细致的工作，来帮助中毒较深、觉悟较慢的受蒙蔽的群众，使那些群众陆续回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    当斗争出现反复的时候，大多数觉悟过来的受蒙蔽的群众能够经得住考验；但是也有极少数人受逆流的冲击转了向，又宣布退出革命派组织。面对这种情况，无产阶级革命派中有些同志感情用事，说什么：“你一次受蒙蔽，还能老受蒙蔽。退出更好，越退我们队伍越纯洁。”宣传队的同志抓住这个活思想，又及时和革命派一起学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和“十六条”，引导大家认识：斗争是会有反复的，做受蒙蔽群众的工作也是会有反复的，要承认这个反复，不怕这个反复。无产阶级革命派中的绝大多数人认识到：首先，资本主义复辟的逆流是来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，而不是来自受蒙蔽的群众，不能动不动就怪受蒙蔽群众。其次，阶级斗争必然要在每个人的头脑里有所反映，有的同志能看得清，站得稳，顶得住；有的可能看不清，受了骗，转了向，这是可以理解的，是不难纠正的。这个反复将使他们取得经验教训，得到锻炼，在斗争中学会斗争。至于有些受蒙蔽的群众加入革命派组织后又退出去，这说明革命派的思想工作还没有做到家，还没有尽到责任。
    于是，革命派同志对退出革命组织的群众，采取了正确的态度：退出不歧视，再加入也欢迎，并且继续主动热情地接近他们，做他们的思想工作。结果，许多退出革命派组织的群众，又纷纷加入了革命派组织。到目前为止，受蒙蔽的群众加入革命派组织的已有七百多人。全厂实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，有力地展开了对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判大斗争，夺取了革命和生产双胜利。
