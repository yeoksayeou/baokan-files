Anti-American protests by Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union have caused the Soviet revisionists to tremble. The Soviet revisionist authorities have even deployed 5,000 military police to act as bodyguards for the U.S. Embassy, blocking the students' protests. The new head of the "security" organization has personally directed the deployment, and the American imperialists are delighted.

	New China News Agency, June 9th: Moscow news: On the 9th, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in Moscow mobilized a large number of military police, actively playing the shameful role of "protectors" of American and British imperialism, openly obstructing Arab, African, Asian, and Latin American students who were heading to the U.S. and British embassies in the Soviet Union to protest. This is another ugly farce performed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, betraying American and British imperialism and selling out the interests of the Arab people.

	That noon, more than a thousand students from Arab countries, as well as Vietnam, Cuba, and other Asian, African, and Latin American countries, marched towards the U.S. Embassy with placards, strongly protesting the armed aggression by American and British imperialism and their lackeys, Israel, against Arab countries. Along the way, they repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with Johnson!" "Down with Wilson!" "Down with American invaders!" "Victory to the Arab people!" "American imperialists out of South Vietnam!"

	However, the revolutionary actions of the Arab, African, Asian, and Latin American students have terrified the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. As early as around 10 a.m., about 5,000 Soviet revisionist military police had already gathered towards the U.S. Embassy. More than 160 military trucks and dozens of large water trucks were parked on several streets around the U.S. Embassy. Various types of large and small police cars were stationed at every intersection leading to the U.S. Embassy. Soldiers and police were stationed on the streets near the U.S. Embassy.

	The entrance to the U.S. Embassy was heavily guarded by Soviet revisionist troops, and ten large water trucks were used to protect the entrance of the U.S. Embassy. A row of Soviet police stood shoulder to shoulder. About 20 to 30 meters further out, there was another dense line of troops forming the third line of defense, and the fourth and fifth lines of defense were composed of about 60 to 70 military trucks and more than a thousand cadets respectively. These five lines of defense forced the marching crowd to pass through a narrow channel about 60 to 70 meters away from the U.S. Embassy.

	The marching crowd stopped in front of the U.S. Embassy, shouting slogans angrily, and several times attempted to break through the lines to rush towards the U.S. Embassy. However, the high-ranking Soviet revisionist military officers personally directed the military police to prevent the students from crossing the lines. The marching crowd, filled with anti-imperialist passion, threw ink bottles at the Soviet revisionist military vehicles and police, expressing their great indignation at the Soviet revisionist leadership's shameful betrayal.

	An Arab student told a Chinese reporter: "We have been requesting the Soviet side for several days to allow us to come here to march, but they have not agreed. In the end, we still came. Look, they have deployed so many soldiers and police!"

	Soviet civilians standing by the roadside, seeing the actions of the Soviet revisionist military police, said discontentedly: "Why don't they let them in?"

	People saw from a distance that the windows of the U.S. Embassy were open, and some Americans were leisurely watching the Soviet revisionists' shameful performance in serving them!

	At 1:30 p.m., the marching crowd, under the obstruction of the Soviet revisionist military police, had to leave the street in front of the U.S. Embassy and head towards the British Embassy. At this time, the Soviet revisionists again dispatched police and police cars to "escort" them along the way.

	When foreign journalists arrived early at the British Embassy, they found that the two ends of the riverside street leading to the British Embassy's residence had already been blocked by large water trucks and cavalry, except for the Soviet revisionist military police, no one was allowed to pass through the street in front of the British Embassy. The British Embassy was also guarded by a large number of military police and military trucks.

	Around 2 p.m., the marching crowd arrived here, but was blocked by the Soviet revisionist cavalry and water trucks about 200 to 300 meters away from the British Embassy. The marching students could only read the protest letter to the British Embassy here. At this time, a small Soviet revisionist police car with a loudspeaker drove into the crowd, attempting to disperse the marching crowd. But the Asian, African, and Latin American students, who had been infuriated by the despicable behavior of the Soviet revisionist leadership, raised their fists in protest against the police car. This small police car finally fled in the face of the students' angry shouts.

	On this day, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique also deployed a considerable number of military police and military trucks near the Israeli Embassy in the Soviet Union.

	The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's ugly actions of obstructing and conspiring to suppress the protests and marches of Asian, African, and Latin American students were carried out in an organized and planned manner. On the 6th, Arab students in Moscow had already proposed to hold a protest in front of the British Embassy. However, the Soviet revisionist authorities not only did not support this revolutionary demand of the Arab students, but on the contrary, starting from the 7th, they actively prepared a series of measures to "protect" the U.S. and British embassies. On the morning of the 8th, the newly appointed head of the Soviet State Security Committee, Andropov, personally led his men to the street opposite the U.S. Embassy to direct the defense. Since then, the U.S. Embassy has been under strict military police surveillance. The Associated Press of the United States reported from Moscow on the 8th: "Moscow police, with the support of hundreds of Russian soldiers, are setting up defenses near the U.S. Embassy today to prepare for the apparent demonstrations against... the role of the United States in the Middle East crisis."

    亚非拉留苏学生反美示威使苏修吓得发抖
    苏修当局竟出动五千军警充当美国使馆保镖阻拦学生示威
    新任“保安”机构头子赤膊上阵指挥布防，美国佬逍遥自在大为赞赏
    新华社九日讯　莫斯科消息：苏修统治集团九日在莫斯科出动大批军警，积极充当美、英帝国主义“保卫者”的可耻角色，公然阻挠前往美、英驻苏联大使馆举行抗议示威的阿拉伯、非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲留学生。这是苏修领导集团演出的投降美、英帝国主义，出卖阿拉伯人民利益的又一幕丑剧。
    这天中午，阿拉伯各国以及越南、古巴等亚非拉国家留学生千余人，手拿标语牌，迈着整齐的步伐奔向美国使馆，强烈抗议美、英帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略。他们一路上不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒约翰逊！”“打倒威尔逊！”“打倒美国侵略者！”“阿拉伯人民必胜！”“美国佬滚出南越！”
    但是，阿拉伯、非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲留学生的这一革命行动，却吓破了苏修统治集团的胆。早在上午十时许，约五千名苏修军警便向美国使馆方向集聚。在美国使馆周围的几条街道上停放着一百六十余部军用大卡车，几十部大型洒水车。各种型号的大小警车，布满了通向美国使馆的各个路口。在美国使馆附近的街道上，站满了军人和警察。
    美国使馆门口由苏修派重兵把守，并用十部大型洒水车把美国使馆大门保护起来，一列苏联警察肩并肩地排列着。再向外约二、三十米处又有一排密密麻麻的队伍组成的第三道防线和分别由有六、七十部军用大卡车以及上千名士官生组成的第四道和第五道防线。这五道防线使得游行队伍只能在距美国使馆六、七十米以外的一条狭小的通道上通过。
    学生游行队伍在美国使馆对面停了下来，愤怒地高呼口号，并几次想冲破防线直奔美国使馆。但是站在军用大卡车上的苏修高级军官亲自指挥军警，阻挠学生越过防线。充满着反帝激情的游行队伍向守卫着美国使馆的苏修军车和警察投墨水瓶，表示他们对苏修领导集团的这种可耻的叛卖行为的极大愤慨。
    一个阿拉伯学生对中国记者说：“我们一连几天要求苏方同意我们到这里来游行，但是他们一直不答应。结果，我们还是来了。你们看，他们布置了多少军人和警察！”
    站在路旁的苏联群众见到苏修军警的行径时不满地说：“为什么不让他们进去？”
    人们从远处看到，美国使馆楼上敞开窗户，一些美国佬逍遥自在地在观望苏修极力为他们效劳的丑态！
    下午一点半钟，游行队伍在苏修军警的百般阻拦下不得不离开美国使馆前的街道，向英国使馆进发。这时，苏修又派警察和警车一路上沿途“护送”。
    当外国记者们提前赶到英国大使馆附近时，发现通向英国使馆住地的沿河大街的两头早已用大型水车和马队封锁起来，除苏修军警外，英国使馆门前的街道任何人不准通行。英国使馆门前也布置了大批军警和军用卡车。
    下午二时左右，游行队伍赶到这里，但是却被苏修马队和水车拒之于离英国使馆约二、三百米之外。游行学生只得在这里宣读向英国使馆提出的抗议信。这时，一部带广播喇叭的苏修小警车开到队伍中，企图驱散游行队伍。但早已被苏修领导集团的卑鄙行为激怒了的亚非拉学生们，纷纷向着警车高举拳头表示抗议。这辆小警车最后在学生们的愤怒声中灰溜溜地逃跑了。
    这一天，苏修统治集团还在以色列驻苏使馆附近布置了相当数量的军警和军用卡车。
    苏修统治集团这次阻挠并阴谋镇压亚非拉学生示威游行的丑恶行径，是有领导、有计划地进行的。阿拉伯国家在莫斯科的留学生六日就已提出要在英国大使馆门前举行示威。但是苏修当局对阿拉伯留学生的这一革命要求不但不支持，相反，从七日起，为保卫美、英大使馆而积极进行一系列的准备。八日上午，苏联新上任的国家安全委员会头目安德罗波夫曾亲自率领人马，到美国大使馆对面街口指挥设防，随后，美国大使馆附近就一直军警戒备森严。美国合众国际社八日发自莫斯科的消息也透露：“莫斯科警察在数百名俄国士兵支持下，今天在美国使馆附近设防，为对付显然要举行的反对……美国在中东危机的作用的示威作好了准备”。（附图片）
