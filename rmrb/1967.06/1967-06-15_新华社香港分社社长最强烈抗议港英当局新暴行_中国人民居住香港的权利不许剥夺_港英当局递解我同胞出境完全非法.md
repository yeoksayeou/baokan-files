	Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency Director Liang Weilin strongly protests the new atrocities by the Hong Kong British authorities. The right of the Chinese people to reside in Hong Kong must not be infringed. The Hong Kong British authorities' deportation of our compatriots is completely illegal.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 14 – Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Director Liang Weilin issued a statement on June 13, expressing the strongest and most severe protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' attempt to use deportation as a means of conducting new fascist persecution against our patriotic compatriots. The full text of Liang Weilin's statement is as follows:

	Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the patriotic struggle against British imperialism by our compatriots in Hong Kong is surging forward with irresistible momentum, fiercely striking at the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong. On June 10, the joint strike by employees of British institutions and workers of British-owned enterprises began, marking a new and major development in the struggle against British imperialism. Faced with this storm of the masses' revolution, British imperialism, this paper tiger, is terrified out of its wits, trying desperately to suppress the flames of the struggle against British imperialism through maddened repression in an attempt to save its doomed fate.

	Recently, the Hong Kong British authorities have even announced that they will deport patriotic compatriots. According to a report in the South China Morning Post on June 9, a spokesman for the Hong Kong British authorities stated on the evening of June 8, "Deportation orders have been issued for three people, and similar actions are being considered for others involved in recent disturbances." The Hong Kong British authorities' measures to persecute our patriotic compatriots are completely illegal and are part of fascist repression. The Chinese people and compatriots in Hong Kong absolutely cannot tolerate such reckless behavior by British imperialism. We strongly protest in the strongest and most severe terms against the Hong Kong British authorities.

	If Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong wish to return to the mainland, the people of the motherland will welcome them at any time. However, the Chinese people and compatriots in Hong Kong absolutely do not allow the Hong Kong British authorities to use trumped-up charges, against their will, to forcibly deport Chinese compatriots. The right of the Chinese people to reside in Hong Kong is sacred and inviolable and must not be infringed upon.

	We solemnly warn British imperialism that in the face of the Chinese people and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, your fascist atrocities and any tricks and schemes are futile. Every new provocation and every new crime will be met with doubled retaliation and punishment. If you dare to continue any fascist persecution, the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong will be thoroughly smashed.

    新华社香港分社社长最强烈抗议港英当局新暴行
    中国人民居住香港的权利不许剥夺
    港英当局递解我同胞出境完全非法
    新华社香港十四日电　新华社香港分社社长梁威林十三日发表谈话，最严重最强烈抗议港英当局妄图用递解出境的办法对我爱国同胞进行新的法西斯迫害。梁威林谈话的全文如下：
    香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，正以锐不可挡之势猛烈地冲击着英帝国主义在香港的反动统治。六月十日，港英机构职工和英资企业工人的联合大罢工开始了，这是反英抗暴斗争的新的重大发展。在这个群众革命风暴的面前，英帝国主义这只纸老虎被吓破了胆，怕得要死，妄图以疯狂的镇压来扑灭反英抗暴斗争的烈火，挽救它们即将灭亡的命运。
    最近，港英当局竟然宣布要递解爱国同胞出境。据《南华早报》六月九日报道，香港英国当局发言人八日晚表示，
  “递解令已签发给三个人，对于与最近骚动事件有关的其他人，亦正在考虑采取同样的行动”。港英这种迫害我爱国同胞的措施，是完全非法的，是法西斯镇压的一个组成部分。中国人民和香港同胞绝对不能容忍英帝国主义的这种胡作非为。我们向港英当局提出最严重最强烈的抗议。
    香港中国同胞自己要回内地，祖国人民是随时都欢迎的，但是中国人民和香港同胞绝对不容许港英当局以莫须有的罪名，违反其本人意志，把中国同胞强行递解出境。中国人民居住在香港是神圣不可侵犯的权利，绝对不容许剥夺。
    我们要严正警告英帝国主义，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和香港爱国同胞面前，你们的法西斯暴行和任何阴谋诡计都是徒劳的。你们每一个新的挑衅，每一次新的罪行，都将受到加倍的反击和惩罚。你们胆敢继续实行任何法西斯的迫害，英帝国主义在香港的反动统治就要遭到彻底粉碎。
