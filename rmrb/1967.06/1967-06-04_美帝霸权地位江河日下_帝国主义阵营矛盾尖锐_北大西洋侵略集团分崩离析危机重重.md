As a crucial pillar of the U.S. policy of aggression, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) recently marked its 18th anniversary in a state of turmoil. The disintegration of this organization is a vivid reflection of the deepening divisions within the imperialist camp and the accelerating decline of U.S. hegemony in Western Europe.

On May 10, NATO held a meeting of defense ministers. However, the customary spring session of the NATO Council, which usually follows this meeting, was conspicuously absent. Prior to this, under the orders of the French government, the U.S. military, which had been stationed in France for over a decade, was expelled. Many military facilities and command centers of the U.S. and NATO, originally concentrated in France, were either relocated to West Germany, moved to the Netherlands, or transferred to Belgium. All this indicates that U.S. hegemony in Western Europe is on the verge of collapse, and the NATO organization it controls is in shambles, barely alive. It is no wonder that General Lyman Lemnitzer, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and Commander-in-Chief of NATO forces, was deeply saddened as he left his headquarters in France, describing the event as "a very sad thing" and "the end of an era."

Last spring, France, seeing that the U.S. was bogged down in Vietnam and unable to focus on Europe, took the opportunity to rebel, announcing that it would withdraw from NATO's military structures starting in July of the previous year. France also ordered the U.S. and NATO forces, command centers, and military bases to withdraw from France by April 1967. Despite the U.S. using both soft and hard tactics, France remained steadfast in its decision.

France's actions further undermined U.S. hegemony in Western Europe, disrupting the U.S.'s military deployments in the region. NATO has since been in decline. France's actions also significantly boosted the centrifugal tendencies of other Western European countries towards the U.S.

After France's withdrawal, West Germany became the main pillar for the U.S. to maintain the remnants of NATO. However, West Germany, having seen the difficulties of following the U.S. foreign policy closely in recent years, has actively improved its relations with France since the Kissinger administration took office. West Germany is particularly dissatisfied with the U.S. using it as a bargaining chip in political deals with the Soviet Union. It strongly opposes the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to maintain nuclear monopoly through the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty," fearing that this will hinder its ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons. It also worries that the eastward shift of U.S. military power will affect U.S. support for West German militarism, among other issues. All signs indicate that contradictions between the U.S. and West Germany are escalating.

Britain, which claims to have a "special relationship" with the U.S., is also dissatisfied with the U.S.'s reliance on West Germany. Moreover, it is noteworthy that Britain, having failed to escape its internal and external political and economic predicaments by siding with the U.S., has once again applied to join the European Economic Community to seek a way out.

As the contradictions between the major countries in NATO and the U.S. deepen, other countries in NATO are no longer following the U.S. blindly.

The "rebellion" of NATO "allies" against the U.S. is also developing in the context of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. After the U.S. decided to further escalate the war in Vietnam at a secret meeting in Guam at the end of March, U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey hurriedly visited seven Western European countries to seek support for the Vietnam War. However, apart from Britain's general support for the U.S. policy in Vietnam, the reactions of other countries were quite lukewarm. The British Guardian newspaper stated: "Most of the smaller countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization tend to sympathize with President de Gaulle's non-cooperative stance on the Vietnam issue."

In an attempt to adapt NATO to the needs of U.S.-Soviet conspiracies to dominate the world, the U.S. tried to use this aggressive military alliance as a tool for "detente" with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. However, the Western European "allies" each have their own agendas. French Foreign Minister Michel Debré publicly declared that the issue of "East-West detente" "is not a matter for the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty to handle, but a matter for the European countries." In fact, in this regard, Western European countries have long since gone their separate ways, with no one willing to be controlled by the U.S., and instead competing with it.

Chairman Mao pointed out, "The era we are now in is one where the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis"; "The imperialist system is riddled with contradictions that cannot be overcome, plunging the imperialists into great anguish." The current state of NATO is a microcosm of the declining U.S. imperialism and the deep crisis within the imperialist camp, marked by sharp contradictions.

    美帝霸权地位江河日下  帝国主义阵营矛盾尖锐
    北大西洋侵略集团分崩离析危机重重
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：作为美国侵略政策重要基石的北大西洋集团，最近在风雨飘摇中度过了它的十八周年。这个集团的分崩离析，是帝国主义阵营内部四分五裂和美帝国主义在西欧的霸权加速衰落的鲜明写照。
    北大西洋集团五月十日举行了国防部长会议。但是，多年来照例紧接在这个会议后举行的北大西洋集团部长理事会春季会议，却毫无消息。在这以前，在法国政府一声逐客令下，十多年来一直盘踞在法国的美军已经滚蛋；美国和北大西洋集团原来集中在法国的许多军事设施和指挥机构，有的撤往西德，有的搬到荷兰，有些迁到比利时。这一切表明：美国在西欧的霸权已经摇摇欲坠，它所控制的北大西洋集团已经七零八落，半死不活。难怪驻欧美军司令兼北大西洋集团军队总司令兰尼兹尔在他的司令部撤离法国时黯然神伤地说，这是“一件十分伤心的事”，“这是一个历史时期的终结”。
    去年春天，法国看到美国在越南泥足深陷，无暇西顾，趁机打出反叛的旗帜，断然宣布从去年七月起退出北大西洋集团的军事机构，并且勒令美国以及这个集团的军队、司令部和军事基地在一九六七年四月以前统统撤出法国。一年来，美国尽管软硬兼施，却无法使法国收回成命。
    法国这一行动，进一步动摇了美国在西欧的霸权，打乱了美国在西欧的军事部署。北大西洋集团从此一蹶不振。法国的行动也大大地打击了美国，助长了其他西欧国家对美国的离心倾向。
    法国退出后，西德成为美国维持北大西洋集团残局的主要支柱。可是西德鉴于近年来紧跟美国的外交方针已经使自己陷入窘境，基辛格政府上台后，积极改善同法国的关系。西德特别不满美国把它当作同苏联作政治交易的筹码。它强烈抵制美苏合谋搞维持核垄断地位的所谓“防止核扩散条约”，因为它担心这会妨碍它实现染指核武器的野心。它还担心美国军事力量东移会影响美国对西德军国主义的支持，等等。种种迹象表明，美国同西德的矛盾正在上升。
    号称同美国有“特殊关系”的英国，对美国倚重西德颇为不满。此外，特别值得注意的是：英国由于投靠美国并不能摆脱在政治、经济上内外交困的局面，反而加剧走投无路的窘境，已再次申请参加西欧“共同市场”以寻求出路。
    在北大西洋集团的主要国家同美国的矛盾进一步加深的情况下，北大西洋集团中的其他一些国家，也不再对美国亦步亦趋了。
    北大西洋“盟国”对美国的“反叛”，在美国侵略越南的问题上也在发展。三月底美国在关岛黑会决定进一步扩大侵越战争以后，美国副总统汉弗莱匆匆访问了西欧七国，再次在侵越战争问题上寻求支持。但是，除英国一般地表示支持美国的侵越政策外，其他国家的反映都十分冷淡。英国《卫报》说：“北大西洋公约组织中的较小国家，大多数都倾向于同情戴高乐总统在越南问题上的不合作态度。”
    为使北大西洋集团适应美苏阴谋主宰世界的需要，美国企图利用这个侵略性军事集团作为同苏联和东欧国家搞“缓和”的工具，但是，西欧“盟国”各有自己的打算，法国外交部长德姆维尔公开声明，“东西方缓和”问题“不是华沙条约和北大西洋条约处理的一个问题，而是欧洲各国的事情”。事实上，在这方面，西欧国家也早已各奔前程，谁都不愿受美国控制，反而同美国竞争。
    毛主席指出，“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”；“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”北大西洋侵略集团的现状，就是美帝国主义江河日下，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重、危机深重的缩影。
