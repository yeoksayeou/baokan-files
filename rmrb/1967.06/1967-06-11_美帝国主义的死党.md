The running dogs of American imperialism

The Soviet revisionist clique has once again staged a counter-revolutionary farce in Moscow, providing the world with yet another piece of evidence of their collusion with American and British imperialism and their betrayal of the Arab people.

The demonstration by Arab and Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union against the aggression of American and British imperialism and their lackey Israel against the Arab countries is a completely revolutionary and just action. However, the Soviet revisionist clique mobilized a large number of military police, set up layers of defenses, and treated the demonstration as a major threat. They pointed their gleaming bayonets at the Arab and Asian, African, and Latin American students, who were filled with anti-imperialist fury but were unarmed. The head of the Soviet State Security Committee, Andropov, even personally led the troops, acting as a faithful lackey of the American embassy in the Soviet Union. Look, how the Soviet revisionist clique cherishes and serves American imperialism with all their might, while hating and despising the revolutionary people with all their might!

The Soviet revisionist clique puts on a show with empty rhetoric, saying some beautiful words in support of the Arab people, but in reality, under the cover of these beautiful words, they collaborate with American and British imperialism, doing their utmost to sabotage and suppress the Arab people's struggle against aggression. The Soviet revisionist clique has already stabbed the Arab people, who are fighting to the death, in the back on the battlefield in the Middle East. Now, they have once again drawn their bayonets against the Arab and Asian, African, and Latin American students in Moscow. The Soviet revisionist clique has declared with their actions that they are the running dogs of American imperialism and the sworn enemies of the Arab people and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!

The incident of suppressing the anti-American demonstrations by Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union is not the first time. Two years ago, the Soviet revisionist clique had already brutally suppressed the demonstrations by Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle. This bunch of Soviet revisionist traitors will suppress any revolution wherever they see it in the world; within the Soviet Union, they do not allow anyone to revolt, do not allow anyone to resist imperialism, and even the Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union are no exception. They will suppress all revolutionary actions with armed force. Revolution is a crime, and anti-imperialism is unreasonable—that is the logic of the Soviet revisionist traitors. The Soviet revisionist clique has become a vicious executioner of the world revolution.

The Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the Arab people is not only a great betrayal of the revolutionary people of the world but also a great betrayal of the Soviet people. Today's Moscow has become a place to suppress the anti-imperialist revolutionary actions of Asian, African, and Latin American students in the Soviet Union. Is this not a great insult to the Soviet people? A large amount of evidence shows that the small clique of revisionists who are currently occupying the Kremlin throne are a bunch of traitors guilty of ten major crimes, and are the dregs of the Soviet people.

Those who do evil will surely come to a bad end. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique will surely be severely punished by the revolutionary people of the world and the Soviet people!

    美帝国主义的死党
    苏修集团又在莫斯科演出了一场反革命的丑剧，向全世界提供了它勾结美英帝国主义、出卖阿拉伯人民的又一个罪证。
    阿拉伯和亚、非、拉留苏学生举行抗议美英帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的示威，完全是革命的正义的行动。可是，苏修集团出动大批军警，布置层层防线，如临大敌，把亮晃晃的刺刀对着满腔反帝怒火、手无寸铁的阿拉伯和亚、非、拉示威学生。苏修国家安全委员会的头子安德罗波夫还亲自出场率领人马，充当美国驻苏大使馆的忠实的走狗。请看，苏修集团对美帝国主义是如何爱护备至，奴相十足，而对革命人民又是如何咬牙切齿，恨之入骨！
    苏修集团在口头上装腔作势，说一些支持阿拉伯人民的漂亮话，实际上却在这些漂亮话的掩护之下，同美英帝国主义分工合作，竭力破坏和扼杀阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争。苏修集团在中东战场上，已经从背后给了浴血战斗中的阿拉伯人民一刺刀。而现在，他们又在莫斯科向阿拉伯和亚非拉留苏学生当面亮出了刺刀。苏修集团用自己的行动，宣布了他们是美帝国主义的死党，是阿拉伯人民和亚非拉人民的死敌！
    在莫斯科发生镇压亚非拉留苏学生反美示威的事件，已不是第一次了。两年前，苏修集团就曾在莫斯科血腥镇压亚非拉留苏学生支持越南人民斗争的游行示威。这一伙苏修叛徒，在国际上见了革命就要去扑灭；在苏联国内，根本不许人们革命，不许人们反帝，连亚非拉留苏学生也不例外。对于一切革命行动，他们都要进行武装镇压。革命有罪，反帝无理，这就是苏修集团的叛徒逻辑。苏修集团已经成为镇压世界革命的一个凶恶的刽子手。
    苏修集团出卖阿拉伯人民，不仅是对全世界革命人民的大背叛，也是对苏联人民的大背叛。今日的莫斯科，竟然变成了镇压亚非拉留苏学生反帝革命行动的地方，这难道不是对苏联人民的一个莫大侮辱吗？大量的事实证明，今天窃据着克里姆林宫宝座的这一小撮修正主义分子，是一伙十恶不赦的叛徒，是苏联人民的败类。
    多行不义必自毙。苏修叛徒集团必将受到全世界革命人民和苏联人民的严厉制裁！
