The Republic of Zambia is an inland country located on the central-southern plateau of Africa. It covers an area of 752,000 square kilometers with a population of approximately four million.

Zambia is world-renowned as the "land of copper." It has copper reserves of about 800 million tons, accounting for a quarter of the total reserves in the capitalist world, and its production ranks second in the capitalist world.

In the late 18th century, Portuguese colonialists first invaded. In 1889, the British colonizer Rhodes established the "British South Africa Company," which seized the eastern part of present-day Zambia. In 1924, Britain placed the entire territory of Zambia under its colonial rule and named it "Northern Rhodesia" after Rhodes, designating it as a British "protectorate."

For over seventy years, the people of Zambia have waged a tenacious struggle against the colonialists. In 1935 and 1940, two massive strikes erupted. Post-World War II, the struggle of the Zambian people surged to new heights. In 1953, Britain forcibly merged Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia), Southern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland (present-day Malawi) into the "Central African Federation." This further provoked local resistance. In early 1959, violent mass struggles broke out here, demanding independence from the "Central African Federation." In August 1961, the struggle of the northern copper miners quickly spread nationwide, dealing a heavy blow to the colonialists. In December 1963, the British colonialists were forced to dissolve the "Central African Federation." In January 1964, they were compelled to agree to "internal self-government" for Northern Rhodesia. On October 24, 1964, the people of Zambia finally won their country's independence and established the republic.

After gaining independence, Zambia pursued a non-aligned foreign policy, opposing imperialism and colonialism, fighting against racial discrimination, and upholding Afro-Asian solidarity. Internally, it made efforts to further eradicate colonial influences, consolidate national independence, and develop the national economy and culture.

The peoples of China and Zambia have forged deep bonds of friendship in their struggles against imperialism and colonialism. The day after Zambia's independence, President Kaunda announced the establishment of diplomatic relations between Zambia and China. On the same month, the 29th, China and Zambia formally established diplomatic relations. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    赞比亚共和国
    赞比亚共和国是非洲中南部高原上的内陆国家。面积为七十五万二千平方公里，人口约四百万。
    赞比亚是世界上著名的“铜矿之乡”。铜蕴藏量约八亿吨，占资本主义世界总蕴藏量四分之一，产量占资本主义世界第二位。
    十八世纪末，葡萄牙殖民主义者首先侵入。一八八九年，英国殖民者罗得斯建立的“英国南非公司”，攫取了现今赞比亚的东部地区。一九二四年，英国把赞比亚全境置于它的殖民统治之下，并用罗得斯的臭名加以命名，称为“北罗得西亚”，被列为英国“保护地”。
    七十多年来，赞比亚人民同殖民主义者进行了英勇顽强的斗争。一九三五年和一九四○年，先后爆发了两次规模巨大的罢工。第二次世界大战后，赞比亚人民的斗争浪潮更是一浪高于一浪。一九五三年，英国曾把北罗得西亚（现赞比亚）、南罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰（现马拉维）强行拼凑了一个“中非联邦”。这更激起了当地人民的反抗。一九五九年初，这里爆发以暴力活动为主的群众斗争，要求摆脱“中非联邦”。一九六一年八月，北部铜矿工人斗争迅速扩及全国，沉重打击了殖民主义者。一九六三年十二月，英国殖民者被迫解散“中非联邦”。一九六四年一月，又被迫同意北罗得西亚实行“内部自治”。一九六四年十月二十四日，赞比亚人民终于赢得了祖国的独立，建立了共和国。
    赞比亚独立后，执行不结盟的外交政策，反帝反殖，反对种族歧视，维护亚非团结；对内为了进一步肃清殖民主义势力，巩固民族独立，发展民族经济和文化，进行了努力。
    中赞两国人民在反帝反殖斗争中结下了深情厚谊。赞比亚独立后的第二天，卡翁达总统就宣布赞比亚同我国建交，同月二十九日，中赞两国正式建立外交关系。（据新华社讯）
