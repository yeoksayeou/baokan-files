    以色列
    在美英帝国主义阴谋策划下，由犹太复国主义者在巴勒斯坦地区强行建立的一个“国家”。位于亚洲西部，地中海东岸。原来霸占的土地面积为一万四千平方公里，后又扩张到两万零七百平方公里。人口约二百六十多万，其中绝大部分是犹太人。首都是耶路撒冷，行政中心在特拉维夫。
    西奈半岛
    阿联领土的亚洲部分。位于苏伊士运河以东，北临地中海，东北边境与以色列毗邻。面积六万平方公里。一九五六年十月，以色列在英法帝国主义唆使下侵入西奈半岛的加沙地带。在埃及人民的坚决反击和全世界人民的反对下，以色列侵略军最后不得不在一九五七年三月八日撤出了西奈半岛。
    加沙地带
    西奈半岛东北角濒地中海的一个狭长地带，南北长四十公里，东西平均宽八公里。除原有当地居民外，还居住着二十七万多巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民。一九五六年以色列由此攻入埃及，并占领了这一地区。一九五七年三月八日以色列侵略军被迫撤出加沙地区。苏伊士运河
