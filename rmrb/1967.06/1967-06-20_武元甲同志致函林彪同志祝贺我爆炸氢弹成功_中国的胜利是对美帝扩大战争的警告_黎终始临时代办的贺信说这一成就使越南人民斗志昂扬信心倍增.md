Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao received a letter from Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, General Vo Nguyen Giap, on June 19, congratulating China on the successful test of its first hydrogen bomb. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To Vice Premier Lin Biao,

Dear Vice Premier,

We are delighted to learn that after successfully conducting five nuclear tests involving atomic bombs, nuclear weapons containing thermonuclear materials, and nuclear missiles, China has successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb on June 17, 1967.

The success of the hydrogen bomb test is a great victory for the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong. This victory marks a new progress in China's nuclear science and technology, which is not only a crucial step in strengthening the national defense of the People's Republic of China but also a warning to the U.S. imperialists' schemes to intensify and expand their aggressive wars. Moreover, it is a powerful encouragement to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and similarly, it is a powerful encouragement to the people and working class of the world in their revolutionary struggles for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism.

On this occasion, I, on behalf of all the cadres and soldiers of the various armed forces of the Vietnamese people, and in my personal capacity, extend my warmest congratulations to you, Vice Premier.

Please convey our cordial greetings and congratulations to all the cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to the Chinese workers, engineers, technicians, and scientists.

Vo Nguyen Giap
Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense
Democratic Republic of Vietnam
June 19, 1967, Hanoi

According to Xinhua News Agency, on June 18, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, Le Cong Binh, wrote a letter to Foreign Minister Chen Yi, expressing the congratulations of the entire staff of the embassy and all Vietnamese comrades in China on China's successful test of its first hydrogen bomb.

The letter states that this great victory is the result of the correct line and wise leadership of the Communist Party of China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. It is a victory achieved by the Chinese people in the field of science and technology through learning and applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The letter says that China's five successful nuclear tests and the successful explosion of the hydrogen bomb have dealt a powerful blow to the scheme of the imperialists, led by the United States, to use nuclear weapons to blackmail and enslave the people of the world.

The letter states that the news of the successful explosion of the Chinese hydrogen bomb has further boosted the morale of our people in the north and south, increased our confidence, and resolved us to fight to the final victory: to defend the north, liberate the south, and ultimately reunify the country.

    新华社十九日讯　中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志今天收到越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲同志十九日写来的祝贺中国成功地爆炸第一颗氢弹的信。贺信的全文如下：中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪
  同志敬爱的副总理同志：
    我们十分欣悉，中国在成功地进行了原子弹、含有热核材料的核武器和导弹核武器的五次试验之后，一九六七年六月十七日，又成功地进行了第一颗氢弹试验。
    氢弹试验的成功，是在中国共产党和敬爱的毛泽东主席领导下的兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军的一个新的伟大胜利。这一胜利标志着中国人民在核科学技术建设事业中的新的进步，不仅对巩固中华人民共和国国防力量事业是一个十分重要的新的步骤，对美帝国主义加紧和扩大侵略战争的阴谋是一个警告，而且对越南人民的抗美救国事业是一个强有力的鼓舞，同样地对世界人民和工人阶级为了和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的革命斗争事业是一个强有力的鼓舞。
    乘此机会，我代表越南人民各种武装力量的全体干部和战士，并以我个人名义，向副总理同志致以最热烈的祝贺。
    请你向中国人民解放军全体干部和战士，向中国工人、工程技术人员和科学家转达我们亲切的问候和祝贺。越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将
            一九六七年六月十九日于河内
    据新华社十九日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始十八日写信给陈毅外交部长，代表大使馆全体干部、工作人员和在中国的全体越南同志，热烈祝贺中国成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹。
    贺信说，这个巨大的胜利是以敬爱的毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党正确路线和英明领导的结果。这是中国人民在科学技术领域内学习和运用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想所取得的胜利。贺信说，中国进行五次核试验成功和这次氢弹爆炸成功，十分有力地打击了以美国为首的好战的帝国主义用核武器对世界各国人民进行讹诈和奴役的阴谋。
    贺信说，中国氢弹爆炸成功的喜讯，更加使我们南北方人民斗志昂扬，使我国人民信心倍增，决心战斗到最后胜利：保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国。
