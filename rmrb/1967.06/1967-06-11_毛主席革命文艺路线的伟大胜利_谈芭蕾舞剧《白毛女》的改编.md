To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the cultural warriors of the Shanghai Dance School once again came to Beijing to perform the ballet "White-Haired Girl." They received high praise from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital. On the evening of April 24, Chairman Mao personally watched this performance and received the entire cast and crew of the troupe. This is a great encouragement to the proletarian revolutionary faction in the national arts community and a major event in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" represents a revolutionary qualitative leap from the opera "White-Haired Girl."

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" is based on the same-named opera. However, in terms of character portrayal and thematic ideas, there are fundamental differences. For the old opera "White-Haired Girl," the new ballet "White-Haired Girl" is a complete transformation and a revolutionary qualitative leap.

On the surface, the characters in the ballet "White-Haired Girl," such as Yang Bailao, Xi'er, Da Chun, and Zhao Da Shu, have the same names as those in the opera "White-Haired Girl." But these are two completely different Yang Bailao, Xi'er, Da Chun, and Zhao Da Shu. Their spiritual appearances and inner souls are vastly different.

In the opera, what kind of Yang Bailao do we see? On New Year's Eve, he goes to the landlord Huang Shiren's house to repay rent, kneels and begs, endures insults and beatings, and is forced to sign a contract to sell his daughter to the landlord's house as a servant. Finally, he is pushed out of the "black lacquered gate" and stumbles to the ground in the snow. When he returns home and sees his daughter Xi'er, whom he relies on for life, he is troubled and hesitant, feeling guilty and unable to control himself. Thus, while Xi'er is asleep, he caresses her, feels bitter and desperate, and then drinks salt water, leaving his daughter in hatred and dying! The Yang Bailao in the opera is such a typical "common person" who only knows how to endure and submit to humiliation! However, the Yang Bailao in the ballet "White-Haired Girl" is completely different. He appears on stage as a bold and straightforward peasant with a backbone. Look! When the landlord Huang Shiren and the henchman Mu Renzhi come to his door to collect rent and forcibly take his daughter, Yang Bailao wields a hoe and bravely fights the enemy, refusing to yield even in the face of death. What a magnificent scene! If the Yang Bailao in the opera gives the impression of a pitiful creature, who is obedient from birth to death, then the Yang Bailao in the ballet is a revolutionary peasant who dares to stand up and fight face-to-face with the reactionary landlord class. Although he was killed by the landlord class, he lives on. His blood spills on the earth, sowing the seeds of revenge.

The protagonist Xi'er in the ballet "White-Haired Girl" is also completely different from the Xi'er portrayed in the opera "White-Haired Girl." The Xi'er in the opera has endured countless humiliations. Her soul is deeply wounded by "spiritual slavery." She serves obediently as a maid in the landlord's house and lives in a cave as the "White-Haired Fairy." On one hand, she escapes and rebels out of anger, but on the other hand, she endures humiliation and even harbors illusions about the landlord class. Such a Xi'er is at most a split personality in the middle. In the ballet "White-Haired Girl," Xi'er is a completely different figure. This Xi'er is a peasant girl with a rebellious spirit. She is tenacious and unyielding, daring to resist and fight. When she is beaten by Huang's mother and Huang Shiren tries to take advantage of her, she does not endure the humiliation and fights back, slapping Huang Shiren and smashing the evil dog with an incense burner. When she encounters Huang Shiren at the temple at night, she immediately grabs a candle stand and pursues him. If the Xi'er in the opera is merely a pitiful peasant girl who is harmed and humiliated, a good woman who is at the mercy of fate and is forced to escape the jaws of the tiger, then the Xi'er in the ballet is a strong grass in the wind, a red plum in the snow. She is truly a good daughter of the poor peasants!

Not only Yang Bailao and Xi'er, but also characters like Da Chun and Zhao Da Shu, their images in the opera and the ballet are also vastly different. In the ballet "White-Haired Girl," Da Chun is no longer the "sentimental" young man in the opera. "The hero's strength, the hero's sword," he joins the Eighth Route Army with great ambition. This is not just to save one Xi'er, but to liberate the thousands and millions of laboring people like Xi'er who are oppressed and enslaved. The Zhao Da Shu in the ballet is not like the Zhao Da Shu in the opera, who vaguely yearns for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, but a Chinese Communist Party underground member with a certain history of struggle. It is under Zhao Da Shu's guidance and help that young people like Da Chun quickly awaken in the face of sharp class struggle and turn their hatred for the class enemy into brave revolutionary actions to join the army and seek liberation.

A strong and simple old peasant Yang Bailao, a steadfast and unyielding peasant girl Xi'er, a vigorous and heroic young soldier Da Chun, and a resolute and steadfast Communist Party member Zhao Da Shu. They are heart to heart with the broad masses of revolutionary peasants and coalesce into an iron-like force that cannot be crushed by any reactionary violence and dares to smash the old world. These are the new stage characters recreated and presented in the ballet "White-Haired Girl."

The question of how to portray workers, peasants, and soldiers is a major principle. Chairman Mao said: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but will sing the praises of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but will sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people: one of the two must be chosen." The ballet "White-Haired Girl" is precisely standing on the proletarian standpoint to sing the praises of the laboring people with great enthusiasm.

From the opera to the ballet, there is a struggle between two worldviews and two methods of creation.

The differences in the series of characters in the ballet and the opera are not just a matter of artistic refinement or technical processing, but a matter of principle regarding the standpoint from which to create characters, the worldview that guides the creation, and the method of creation.

Chairman Mao said: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is several thousand years of civilization. To explain history from this point of view is called historical materialism, and to stand on the opposite side of this point of view is historical idealism." This is the highest guiding principle for our proletarian literature and art in observing and describing social history. The authors of the opera "White-Haired Girl" did not use the proletarian historical materialist viewpoint to observe the objective world in which the series of characters in the "White-Haired Girl" story are placed, to analyze the class relationships of these characters, and how such class relationships endow these characters with typical personalities in typical environments. On the contrary, they stubbornly expressed the bourgeois worldview and literary viewpoint in creating the characters in the opera "White-Haired Girl."

From the characters in the opera "White-Haired Girl," it is not difficult to see that the authors completely started from the bourgeois humanitarian and humanist viewpoint. It is precisely because of this pitying and compassionate bourgeois humanitarian viewpoint that the authors of the opera portrayed a series of stage characters as humble, weak, and helpless roles. Among them, Yang Bailao and Xi'er are the most representative. The authors deliberately described their painful and helpless lives and whipped and interrogated their souls on stage. Obviously, the Yang Bailao and Xi'er in the opera "White-Haired Girl" are the same as the "small people" who are often seen in the works of Western bourgeois writers, who are humiliated and harmed. Can such character images inspire people to fight against the evil old society and the reactionary ruling class? Can they guide people to the path of revolutionary struggle? No! At most, they tell those who are at a loss in the old society and are humiliated and harmed "lowly people" to dream of another slightly more "civilized" way of exploitation and oppression. Engels repeatedly and sharply criticized those bourgeois writers who only "sing the praises of the 'poor,' sing the praises of those with humble, pious, and contradictory wishes, sing the praises of various 'small people,' but do not sing the praises of the stubborn, stormy, and revolutionary proletariat," saying that they are "cowardly and stupid, womanly sentimental, contemptible petty-bourgeois vulgarity, this is the muse that stirs the poet's heart." The authors of the opera "White-Haired Girl" have not broken away from the trap of this pitying and compassionate bourgeois humanitarianism and humanism. Such works and character images, how can they "awaken the people, inspire the people, and push the people to unite and struggle, to transform their environment"?

The proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview show their sharp opposition and struggle in revealing the theme of "White-Haired Girl" and creating characters.

The theme of the opera "White-Haired Girl" is: "The old society turns people into ghosts, and the new society turns ghosts into people." Using the black jargon of the counter-revolutionary revisionist leader of the literary and artistic circles, Zhou Yang, in the article "New People's Literature and Art," it is to describe the "tragic scenes" in China's rural areas and "expose the joyful scenes of men and women's new life after liberation." Obviously, such a theme is a serious distortion of reality and class struggle. It is true that the old society, full of class oppression and exploitation, is a hell on earth. In the old society, tens of thousands of laboring people suffered cruel torture and destruction, but does that mean they all "turned into ghosts"? No! The laboring people are not silent and allow the reactionary ruling class to manipulate their fate. They are not wandering ghosts, but the driving force of world history. They have never been frightened, conquered, or annihilated by the reactionary ruling class. They crawl out from the ground, wipe off the blood on their bodies, bury their comrades' corpses, and continue to fight. Our great leader Chairman Mao praised the Chinese Communists with these words, which are also very appropriate as a portrayal of the laboring people's relentless struggle in Chinese history. This is the essence of history. The opera "White-Haired Girl" was produced at a time when China's peasants were fighting bravely against the enemy under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. However, the authors of the opera clung to their old almanacs and old rules, insisting on emphasizing the "tragic scenes" they were fond of, such as "the old society turning people into ghosts," and ignoring the broad masses of people's relentless resistance and struggle. Is this accidental? No! This is determined by their bourgeois worldview and literary viewpoint. In their minds, the peasants of the old society are not the true driving force of history, but are helpless and desperate "poor people" under heavy class oppression. They are so eager to exaggerate the "tragic scenes" of "the old society turning people into ghosts" precisely because of their reactionary and decadent bourgeois worldview. These bourgeois noblemen-style "philanthropists" have always regarded the laboring people as the mob, as humble and pitiful "small people."

In fact, the theme expressed by the authors of the opera "White-Haired Girl," whether it is "the old society turning people into ghosts" or "the new society turning ghosts into people," it blurs the class nature of people. The work not only removes the class nature of the poor and lower-middle peasants who dare to rebel and revolt by turning people into ghosts, but also removes the class struggle that still exists under the new social conditions by turning ghosts into people. The authors of the opera "White-Haired Girl" reduced the liberation of people, which they had abstracted, to the appearance of what they called "joyful scenes of men and women's new life," as if the liberation of the "White-Haired Girl's" hometown were the end of the revolution, and ignored that the people's war under the leadership of the Communist Party of China was still waiting to achieve greater victories, liberate all of China, and carry the revolution to the end. In their souls' bourgeois kingdom, there is only the liberation of the "individual," but not the liberation of the class of the exploited and oppressed people. They are sensitive to the "tragic scenes" that the "poor people" encounter, but are indifferent to the heroic struggle of the revolutionary people. They feel that the armed struggle of the revolutionary people to seize power is too "gunpowder-like," but are eager to exaggerate the tragic and romantic stories of young men and women. They lack true enthusiasm for the great revolutionary storm of the billions of peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party, and have no prospect of the more magnificent and arduous "long march" of the liberated peasants to build a new socialist China. Instead, they are intoxicated with the peaceful and comfortable "pastoral life" they have long yearned for, and want to "expose" the "joyful scenes of men and women's new life in the countryside after liberation." Under the guidance of such a theme, although the opera "White-Haired Girl" itself touches on the reality of class struggle in the countryside to a certain extent, it is inevitably deeply stamped with the class mark of the bourgeoisie. In terms of the theme, the opera "White-Haired Girl" and the ballet "White-Haired Girl" are in sharp contrast, facing each other head-on.

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" runs a red line of class struggle through the play "White-Haired Girl," revealing to the broad audience through the vivid characters created by the ballet: Under the heavy oppression and slavery of the old China, the peasants never surrendered but fought bravely and tenaciously! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the broad masses of revolutionary peasants took up arms to fight for power, continuously expanding the ranks of fighters, moving from one victory to another, and pushing the revolution forward!

It can be seen that deeply revealing the class contradictions and class struggles in China's rural areas is the core of the theme of the ballet "White-Haired Girl."

It can be seen that there is a serious difference in principle between the opera "White-Haired Girl" and the ballet "White-Haired Girl":

One stands on the bourgeois standpoint, seriously distorting the image of the peasants, while the other stands on the proletarian standpoint, correctly portraying the image of the peasants; one uses the bourgeois humanist and humanitarian viewpoint to create the characters in the play, while the other uses the proletarian class struggle viewpoint to create the characters in the play; one uses the bourgeois old realism method, stopping at exposing the darkness of the old society, while the other uses the method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism, pointing out the path of struggle to the broad masses of people through the description of class struggles in real life.

The birth of the ballet "White-Haired Girl" is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Without thorough reform, there would be no new ballet "White-Haired Girl." It must be pointed out that the reason why the opera "White-Haired Girl" is full of bourgeois trash is entirely due to the serious influence of the revisionist black line in the literary and artistic circles represented by Zhou Yang and the party's top capitalist-roader in charge.

As early as 1945, when the opera "White-Haired Girl" was just being rehearsed, Zhou Yang summoned the authors of the play to give them a black directive, insisting on deleting the scene in the second act where Da Chun and Da Suo go to Huang's house to snatch Xi'er and clash with the landlord tyrants. Zhou Yang said viciously: "This is completely against realism! How can peasants rebel so easily!" He also said: "Don't write it like 'Water Margin'!" Look, Zhou Yang, this son of the landlord class, actually ordered the authors to completely portray Xi'er and other characters as images of the humiliated and harmed, and absolutely not allow them to rebel! What is even more intolerable is that Zhou Yang also vigorously promoted the philosophy of betrayal. From the reactionary bourgeois humanist viewpoint, he wanted the authors and directors to design Xi'er's illusions about Huang Shiren after being raped by him. The original play wrote a scene where Xi'er hopes that Huang Shiren will marry her, with a line: "For the past seven months, there is no way, only to rely on him, to lower one's head and pass the days." This is utterly absurd, making people unable to watch. During the rehearsal of the play, Zhou Yang was very appreciative of these scenes, praising them highly, saying "this is the best way to handle it." It is said that during the War of Liberation, once the opera "White-Haired Girl" was performed on the front line, when Xi'er fantasized about Huang Shiren marrying her, a soldier stood up excitedly and shouted to the stage: "Xi'er, you must not betray!" This vividly shows that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have long been firmly resisting such compromises of class contradictions and vilification of the laboring people.

Zhou Yang also did not allow the opera "White-Haired Girl" to end with the masses demanding the execution of the landlord tyrant who had blood on his hands. At that time, the poor peasants of Qiao'ergou and the revolutionary students and staff of Lu Xun Academy of Arts demanded that the play end with the execution of Huang Shiren, but Zhou Yang used the party's policy of "rent reduction and interest reduction" as an excuse to protect the landlord tyrant in the play!

This is not just a matter of choosing a plot, but a stubborn expression of Zhou Yang's long-standing opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and extreme hatred of the peasant revolution.

"Learning from the master." The various bad ideas of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line leader Zhou Yang about the opera "White-Haired Girl" are based on the various reactionary "theories" of his big backer and ancestor—the top capitalist-roader in the party.

The top capitalist-roader in the party has always enthusiastically promoted the reactionary fallacy of "oppression is reasonable, exploitation is reasonable." Wasn't it he who, on the eve of the nationwide land reform, enthusiastically protected his relatives in the style of Huang Shiren? Wasn't it he who described a blood-debted landlord tyrant as "probably a rich peasant, so his land and property can remain untouched and will not suffer any loss"? Wasn't it he who, at this time, carefully planned for the landlord's wife and relatives how to resist "rent reduction and deposit refund," and said what "probably this autumn harvest, you can still collect rent for one year, which is legal"? Wasn't it he who, for the landlord class, devised strategies and schemes, trying to secretly transfer the landlord economy, which was about to be uprooted, into a rich peasant economy, saying what "in the future, being a rich peasant, hiring workers to farm, and farming oneself, this is possible, legal, and will not face major struggles"? He even openly declared: "Because hiring people to farm is allowed, it is also beneficial to the poor," so "you can tell your relatives in the countryside that for the sake of production, you can hire long-term and short-term workers, agree on wages, sign contracts, and treat workers according to the contract in the future, and there will be no problems."

The top capitalist-roader in the party not only enthusiastically protects the big and small "Huang Shiren," "Mu Renzhi," and "Huang's mother" style "relatives" around him but also openly creates the reactionary "theoretical" basis for the landlord class's "exploitation is beneficial, exploitation is reasonable." He advocates developing the landlord capitalist economy of "people eating people" for the sake of "social progress" and "production development," and even says nonsense until the liberation of the whole country that "today it is not... too much exploitation, but too little, the suffering of workers and peasants lies in the fact that no one exploits them, you have the ability to exploit more, it is beneficial to the country and the people."

The top capitalist-roader in the party, in order to grind away the revolutionary spirit of the people, preaches the reactionary philosophy of "rebellion is unreasonable" everywhere. In the notorious poisonous weeds he concocted, such as "Cultivation," he actually wants people to learn the Confucian and Song Dynasty philosophy of maintaining the interests of the feudal landlord class and the philosophy of self-cultivation. He talks about "comparing hearts," "do not impose on others what you do not want for yourself," "treat yourself strictly and blame others lightly," he wants people to "cultivate" to be "thick-skinned," "a little stupid," "to forgive others with a broad and magnanimous spirit." He eagerly discovers the so-called "tolerance" of the proletariat and revolutionary peasants towards all exploiting classes, regards this fabricated "tolerance" as the "virtue" of the exploited and oppressed people, and even elevates it to the highest "cultivation" he requires! He requires people to be "tolerant, forgiving, and accommodating," and even in necessary times, to "endure various misunderstandings and humiliations without any resentment!" All these "tolerance" virtues are necessary for his so-called "facing reality, recognizing reality, and seeking survival and development in reality." The reactionary "philosophy" he advocates is two-faced: on the one hand, it is a philosophy of enslavement for the exploited and oppressed people, making the masses endure and endure under the oppression of the reactionary rulers, not allowing them to rebel and revolt, but to be slaves who endure humiliation and are gentle and respectful; on the other hand, it becomes a philosophy of covering up the faces of traitors for a small group of capitalist-roaders within the party. At this time, their so-called "tolerance" becomes "bearing humiliation and responsibility," and they can betray and sell the interests of the party and the people under the name of "bearing humiliation and responsibility," collude with the enemy, and promote their line of class capitulationism and national capitulationism of counter-revolutionary revisionism. This "tolerance" philosophy is a thorough philosophy of slavery, a thorough philosophy of betrayal, and a philosophy of capitulationism! The master has such disciples, Zhou Yang and his ilk, who try every means to blacken Xi'er, fabricate her illusions about Huang Shiren, and sing nonsense like "there is no way, only to rely on him, to lower one's head and pass the days," is not accidental. This is the stubborn expression of the souls of this group of big traitors and a big exposure of their philosophy of survival.

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" is a good example of "using foreign things for Chinese purposes" and "innovating the old." Its important achievements lie not only in correcting the distorted images of peasants and themes in the opera but also in using a series of vivid stage art images to concentrate on expressing the Marxist truth of "rebellion is reasonable," thereby sharply exposing the reactionary tricks of the black line leader Zhou Yang in the literary and artistic circles, refuting the slanders of the top capitalist-roader in the party against the revolutionary people and his advocacy of the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and correctly revealing how the laboring people of China, under the heavy oppression of the reactionary ruling class, launched resistance and struggle.

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, through the efforts of broad revolutionary comrades, China's Peking Opera Revolution, Ballet Revolution, and Symphony Revolution have achieved great victories. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line! The appearance of revolutionary ballets such as "White-Haired Girl" and a batch of revolutionary model operas is a red plum that heralds spring. It opens up a new era for ballet art. It tells us that after this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, there will definitely be more excellent literary and artistic works, and socialist literature and art will definitely flourish and bloom, presenting a new look. Lu Xun said well: "Without a pioneer who breaks through all traditional thoughts and methods, China will not have real new literature and art." To create more good models in literature and art, we must forge ahead, thoroughly break with all the old thoughts and methods of the exploiting classes, and continue to strive. We must not forget that there is still a very fierce, very sharp, and very complicated class struggle in the field of literature and art. We must not relax our vigilance and must closely unite with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must further thoroughly criticize the black line in the literary and artistic circles represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, thoroughly eliminate their evil influences, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in every position in the field of literature and art.

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

    毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利
    ——谈芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的改编
    公盾
    为纪念我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，上海市舞蹈学校的文艺战士们再度来京，演出芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，受到了首都广大工农兵群众的好评。四月二十四日晚，毛主席亲自观看了这个剧目，并接见了全体演员和剧团工作人员，这是对全国文艺界无产阶级革命派的巨大鼓舞，这是无产阶级文化大革命中的一件大喜事。
    《白毛女》从歌剧到芭蕾舞剧是一个革命的质的飞跃
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是在同名歌剧的基础上改编的。但是，从歌剧到舞剧，无论在人物塑造和主题思想方面都有质的不同。对于旧歌剧《白毛女》说来，新的芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》全然是一次批判的脱胎换骨，是一次革命的质的飞跃。
    从表面看来，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》里的人物杨白劳、喜儿、大春、赵大叔等，都是歌剧《白毛女》里的同姓名的人物。但这是截然不同的两个杨白劳，两个喜儿，两个王大春，两个赵大叔，……他们的精神面貌，他们的灵魂深处，是大不相同的。
    我们在歌剧里所看到的是个什么样的杨白劳呢？他在大年夜，跑到地主黄世仁家去还租债，屈膝祈求，受尽了谩骂侮辱，挨尽地主和狗腿子的拳打脚踢，被逼着按上手印，把自己的亲闺女卖给地主家当丫头，最后被地主推出“黑漆大门”，踉踉跄跄地倒在雪地上。当他回家，见到与自己相依为命的亲闺女喜儿时，他心事重重，欲言又止，内心负疚，不能自已，于是，趁着喜儿熟睡的时候，对她爱抚一番，悲愤欲绝，然后喝了盐卤，撇下自己的亲闺女恨恨地死去了！歌剧里的杨白劳，就是这样一个只知道逆来顺受、忍辱屈从的一个典型的“芸芸众生”式的人物！而芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》里面的杨白劳，则全然不同了。他是以一个豪迈爽朗的硬骨头性格的贫农形象出现在舞台上的。看！当地主黄世仁、狗腿子穆仁智登门逼债、强抢他的闺女时，杨白劳抡起扁担同敌人英勇搏斗，宁死不屈。这是何等壮烈的场面啊！如果说，歌剧里的杨白劳给人的印象只是个可怜虫，从生到死都当恭顺的“良民”，那么，芭蕾舞剧里的杨白劳，则是一个敢于站起来与反动地主阶级进行面对面的英勇搏斗的革命农民。他虽然被地主阶级杀害了，但虽死犹生，他的鲜血洒在大地上，播下了复仇的火种。……
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》中的女主人公喜儿，与歌剧《白毛女》中所塑造的喜儿的形象，也是完全不同的。歌剧中的喜儿，受尽了人间多少屈辱，她的灵魂深处，又埋藏着多少“精神奴役的创伤”啊！她在地主家里服服贴贴地当丫头，她在山洞里过着“白毛仙姑”的生活。她一方面因愤恨而逃亡反抗，另一方面又忍辱偷生甚至对地主阶级抱有幻想，这样一个喜儿充其量也只是个性格分裂的中间人物。而在芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》里，喜儿则完全是另外一个形象。这个喜儿，是一个富有反抗性格的贫农女儿。她顽强不屈，敢于反抗，敢于斗争。当她遭黄母毒打后，黄世仁妄图乘机侮辱她时，她不甘凌辱，奋起反抗，反手给黄世仁一记耳光，并捧起香炉，怒砸恶狗。当她深夜在奶奶庙偶尔碰到黄世仁时，立刻拿起蜡台飞身追击。如果说，歌剧里的喜儿，只不过是个被损害被侮辱的贫农女儿的形象，是个任凭命运摆布，只是被迫逃出虎口的善良妇女的形象；而在舞剧《白毛女》里，则是一株疾风中的劲草，霜雪里的红梅，她不愧是贫农的好女儿！
    不仅是杨白劳、喜儿，就是王大春、赵大叔这些人物，在歌剧和芭蕾舞剧中所塑造的人物形象，也迥然不同。在舞剧《白毛女》里的王大春，已不是歌剧里“儿女情长”的温顺青年。“健儿身手健儿刀”，他满怀壮志地投奔八路军，这不仅仅是为了解救一个喜儿，而是为了解放处在水深火热之中的千千万万象喜儿一样被压迫被奴役的劳动人民。芭蕾舞剧里的赵大叔，也不象歌剧里的赵大叔那样，只是蒙蒙胧胧地向往共产党、八路军，而是一个有着一定斗争经历的中国共产党的地下党员。正是在赵大叔的帮助和指引下，才使王大春等年青人在尖锐的阶级斗争面前，迅猛地觉醒过来，把自己对阶级敌人的满腔仇恨，化作参军求解放的英勇的革命行动。
    一个刚强朴质的老贫农杨白劳，一个坚贞不屈的贫农女儿喜儿，一个英武勃勃的子弟兵王大春，一个沉毅坚定的共产党员赵大叔。他们和广大的革命农民心连心，凝结成一股任何反动暴力也压不垮的、敢于起来砸烂旧世界的钢铁般的力量。这就是经过再创造，而在芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》中所再现出来的崭新的舞台人物形象。
    把工农兵塑造成什么样的形象，这是一个重大的原则问题。毛主席说：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》正是站在无产阶级立场上，来满怀热情地歌颂劳动人民的。
    从歌剧到芭蕾舞剧贯串着两种世界观、两种创作方法的斗争
    芭蕾舞剧与歌剧里这一系列人物形象有这样的不同，决不是什么一般的艺术提炼或技巧加工的问题，而是站在什么样的立场上，以什么样的世界观为指导，用什么样的创作方法来塑造人物形象的原则问题。
    毛主席说：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”这就是我们无产阶级的文学艺术在观察描写社会历史时的最高指导方针。歌剧《白毛女》的作者们，不是用无产阶级历史唯物论的观点去观察《白毛女》故事中一系列人物所处的客观世界，去分析这些人物的阶级关系，以及这样的阶级关系怎样赋予这些人物以典型环境中的典型性格，恰恰相反，他们在塑造歌剧《白毛女》的人物形象时，却顽强地表现了资产阶级的世界观和文艺观。
    从歌剧《白毛女》的人物形象身上不难看出，作者完全是从资产阶级人道主义、人性论的思想观点出发的。正是由于这种悲天悯人的资产阶级人道主义观点，歌剧的作者们把一系列舞台人物，都塑造成了卑微软弱、贫苦无告的角色。其中杨白劳和喜儿这两个人物，是最富有代表性的。作者刻意地抒写他们的痛苦无依的生活，在舞台上鞭笞和审讯他们的灵魂。显然，歌剧《白毛女》里的杨白劳父女，正是西欧资产阶级文学家笔下所常见的那些被侮辱被损害的“小人物”的形象。这样的人物形象，能激励人们起来向万恶的旧社会，向反动统治阶级进行斗争吗？能引导人们走向革命斗争的道路吗？不！他们顶多是告诉那些在旧社会走投无路的被侮辱与被损害的“卑贱者”，从绝望中去憧憬另一种较为“文明”一些的剥削方式和压迫方式罢了。恩格斯曾经多次辛辣地申斥过那些资产阶级作家只会“歌颂‘穷人’，歌颂怀着卑微的、虔诚的和互相矛盾的愿望的人，歌颂各种各样的‘小人物’，然而并不歌颂倔强的、叱咤风云的和革命的无产者”，说他们“怯懦和愚蠢、妇人般的多情善感、可鄙的小资产阶级的庸俗气，这就是拨动诗人心弦的缪斯。”歌剧《白毛女》的作者们，并没有超脱这种悲天悯人的资产阶级人道主义和人性论的窠臼。象这样的作品和人物形象，怎么能够“使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境”呢？
    无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观在揭示《白毛女》的主题思想和塑造人物形象中，显示了它们之间的尖锐的对立和斗争。
    歌剧《白毛女》表现的主题思想是：“旧社会把人变成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人。”运用文艺界反革命修正主义总头目周扬在《新的人民的文艺》一文中的黑话来说，就是描写了我国农村的“惨烈场面”，“揭露了解放后农村男女新生活的愉快光景”。显然，这样的主题思想，是严重地歪曲了现实生活和阶级斗争的。不错，充满阶级压迫、阶级剥削的旧社会，是人间地狱。在旧社会，成千上万的劳动人民受了残酷的折磨和摧残，但是难道就因此都“变成鬼”了吗？不！劳动人民决不是沉默无声地任凭反动统治阶级摆布自己命运，决不是飘泊无定的虚幻的幽灵，而是创造世界历史的动力。他们在反动统治阶级的残酷镇压面前，从来“没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝。他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”我们伟大领袖毛主席称颂中国共产党人的这一段话，拿来作为我国历史上劳动人民前仆后继的斗争的写照，也是很恰当的。这才是历史的本质。歌剧《白毛女》产生的年代，正当我国农民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，向民族敌人展开英勇斗争的时代。但是，歌剧的作者却死死地抱住他们的老皇历、老章程，硬是要着重表现他们所热中的“旧社会把人变成鬼”的“惨烈场面”，无视广大人民群众前仆后继、英勇不屈的反抗和斗争，这难道是偶然的吗？不！这是由于他们的资产阶级世界观和文艺观所决定的。在他们的心目中，旧社会的农民并不是历史的真正动力，而只是在深重的阶级压迫下走投无路的、无可奈何的“穷人”。他们所以要这样狂热地去渲染什么“旧社会把人变成鬼”的“惨烈场面”，完全是由他们的反动腐朽的资产阶级世界观所决定的，这些资产阶级贵族老爷式的“慈善家”，从来就是把劳动人民看作群氓，看作卑微、可怜的“小人物”的。
    事实上，歌剧《白毛女》的作者们所表现的主题思想，无论是“旧社会把人变成鬼”也罢，“新社会把鬼变成人”也罢，都模糊了人的阶级性，它着重表现的始终是抽象的“人”。作品不但由于“把人变成鬼”，从而抽去了贫下中农敢于起来革命造反的阶级本性；并且由于“把鬼变成人”，把贫下中农的革命翻身、被剥削被压迫阶级的解放变成了抽象的“人”的解放，这样就完全抽去了在新社会条件下还继续存在着的阶级对抗和阶级斗争。歌剧《白毛女》的作者们把这种被他们抽象化了的“人”的解放，归结为出现了什么“男女新生活的愉快光景”，似乎“白毛女”家乡的解放就是革命的终结，而无视当时中国共产党领导下的人民战争还正待夺取更大的胜利，解放全中国，将革命进行到底。在他们灵魂深处的资产阶级王国里，只有“个人”的解放，而没有被剥削被压迫人民的阶级的解放；他们对于“穷人”遭遇到的“惨烈场面”有悲天悯人的敏感，而对于革命人民的英勇抗争却麻木不仁；他们对于革命人民夺取政权的武装斗争感到“火药味太浓”，却热中于渲染青年男女悲欢离合的“传奇”；他们对于亿万农民在共产党领导下的伟大革命风暴中的翻身和觉醒缺乏真正的热情，对于翻身农民建设社会主义新中国的更加伟大而又艰巨的“万里长征”没有丝毫的展望，却醉心于炮制他们早已心向往之的恬静安逸的“田园生活”，要去“揭露”什么“解放后农村男女新生活的愉快光景”。歌剧《白毛女》在这样一个主题思想的指导下，尽管作品本身在一定限度内接触到当时农村阶级斗争的现实，但是它仍然不可避免地被深深地打上了资产阶级的阶级烙印。在主题思想上，歌剧《白毛女》和芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》之间是一个强烈的对比，是针锋相对的对比。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》把一条阶级斗争的红线贯串在《白毛女》这部剧作中，通过舞剧所塑造的活生生的人物形象，对广大观众揭示了：在沉重的奴役压迫下的旧中国农民，始终没有屈服，而是顽强不屈地英勇战斗着！广大的革命农民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下拿起了枪杆子，为夺取政权进行着武装斗争，不断地扩大战斗的行列，从一个胜利走向又一个新的胜利，将革命不断地推向前进！
    由此可见，深刻地揭示我国农村的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，是芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》主题思想的核心。
    由此可见，歌剧《白毛女》同芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》之间存在着严重的原则分歧：
    一个是站在资产阶级的立场上，严重地歪曲农民的形象，一个是站在无产阶级的立场上，正确地塑造农民的形象；一个是用资产阶级人性论、人道主义的观点来塑造剧中人物，一个是用无产阶级的阶级斗争的观点来塑造剧中人物；一个是用资产阶级旧现实主义的方法，止于揭露旧社会的黑暗；一个是用革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的方法，通过对现实生活中阶级斗争的描写，给广大人民指出了战斗的道路。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的产生，是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利
    不破不立，不对歌剧《白毛女》进行彻底的改造，就不会出现崭新的舞剧《白毛女》。必须指出，歌剧《白毛女》之所以充斥着资产阶级的烂货，这完全是由于以周扬为代表的修正主义文艺黑线和充任他们后台老板的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的严重影响。
    远在一九四五年初，当歌剧《白毛女》刚排演时，周扬就召唤该剧作者到他那里去作了黑指示，硬要删去原剧中第二幕大春和大锁到黄家去抢喜儿与地主恶霸发生冲突的情节。周扬恶狠狠地说：“这完全是违反现实主义！农民起来反抗哪有这么容易！”又说：“不要把它写得象《水浒传》一样呀”。请看，周扬这个地主阶级的孝子贤孙，竟然下令要把喜儿等人物彻底塑造成为被污辱被损害者的形象，根本不准他们起来反抗！更令人不能容忍的是，周扬还竭力宣扬叛徒哲学。他从反动的资产阶级人性论的观点出发，要剧作者和导演设计什么喜儿受黄世仁奸污以后，对黄世仁存有幻想。原剧写喜儿希望黄世仁娶她这个情节，有一段唱词是：“自那以后七个月啊！没法，只有依靠他，低头过日月啊！”真是混帐之极，叫人看不下去。剧本彩排时，周扬十分欣赏这些情节，满口赞赏，说“这样处理才好”。据说，解放战争期间，有一次在前方演出歌剧《白毛女》，当演到喜儿幻想黄世仁娶她时，一个战士激动地站起来大声向台上喊道：“喜儿，你可不能叛变啊！”这突出地说明了广大工农兵群众对于这样调和阶级矛盾、丑化劳动人民的恶作剧是早就坚决抵制的。
    周扬还不准在歌剧《白毛女》结尾写群众要求枪毙那个双手沾满人民鲜血的恶霸地主。当时，桥儿沟贫下中农和鲁艺革命师生、炊事员纷纷要求在剧的结尾枪毙黄世仁，而周扬却以当时党的政策是“减租减息”为借口，包庇了这个剧中的恶霸地主！
    这绝不简单是一个情节的取舍，而正是周扬一贯反对毛泽东思想，极端仇视农民革命的地主资产阶级反动本性的顽强表现。
    “徒从师出”。文艺界反革命修正主义黑线的头目周扬关于歌剧《白毛女》的各种坏主意，是以他的大靠山和祖师爷——党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的各种反动“理论”为依据的。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派一贯狂热宣扬“压迫有理，剥削有理”的反动谬论。不正是他，在全国土改前夕还竭力包庇他的黄世仁式的亲戚吗？不正是他，把一个有血债的恶霸地主说成是“大概要算富农，所以他家土地和财产可以不动，不会受什么损失”吗？不正是他，在这个时候，还替地主婆亲戚精心筹划如何对抗“减租退押”，并说什么“大概今年秋收，你们还可以收一年租，是合法的”吗？正是他，竭力为地主阶级出谋献策，妄图把眼看要被连根铲除的地主经济悄悄地转移为富农经济，说什么“以后作富农，雇请工人种地，自己也种地，这是可以的，合法的，不会受到大的斗争的”。他甚至公然宣称：“因为允许雇人种地，对穷人也是有好处的”，“故可告诉乡下的亲故们，为了进行生产，尽可雇请长工和短工，讲好工钱，订好合同，以后按合同待遇工人，就不会有问题”。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派不但要情意倍加地去竭力包庇在他身边的大大小小“黄世仁”、“穆仁智”、“黄母”式的“亲故”，而且明目张胆地为地主资产阶级制造“剥削有功、剥削有理”的反动“理论”根据。他鼓吹要为推动“社会进步”、“发展生产”去发展地主资本家的人吃人的剥削经济，直到全国解放还胡说什么“今天不是……剥削太多，而是太少了，工人农民的痛苦在于没有人剥削他们，你们有本事多剥削，对国家对人民都有利。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为了磨掉革命人民的造反精神，他又到处宣讲“造反无理”的反动哲学。在他所炮制的毒害人们心灵的臭名昭著的《修养》等毒草中，竟要人们去学习维护封建地主阶级利益的孔孟之道和宋儒修身哲学。大讲什么“将心比心”，“己所不欲勿施于人”，“躬自厚，而薄责于人”，他要人们“修养”成“浑厚”，“胡涂一点”，“要用宽宏大量的精神原谅他人”。他竭力从无产阶级和革命农民身上去发现所谓“对于一切剥削阶级”的“忍耐性”，把这个莫须有的“忍耐性”硬当作被剥削被压迫人民的“美德”，甚至升华成为他所要求的最高“修养”！他要求人们“宽大、容忍和委曲求全”，“甚至在必要的时候能够忍受各种误解和屈辱而毫无怨恨之心！”而这一切“忍耐”的品德，都是为了他所谓“正视现实，认识现实，在现实中求得生存和发展”所必需的。他鼓吹的这套反动“哲学”一身而两用：一方面，它对于被剥削被压迫人民来说，是愚民的哲学，叫老百姓在反动统治者的压迫面前忍耐再忍耐，不准起来革命造反，而要当忍辱屈从、温良恭顺的奴隶；另一方面，它对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派来说，则成了掩盖他们叛徒面目的哲学，这时他们的所谓“忍耐”就成了“忍辱负重”，他们就可以在“忍辱负重”的名义下去叛变投敌，去出卖党和人民的利益，去和敌人搞阶级合作，推行他们的阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的反革命修正主义路线。这种“忍耐”哲学是彻头彻尾的奴隶主义哲学，是彻头彻尾的叛徒哲学，投降主义哲学！有什么样的师傅就有什么样的徒弟，周扬之流千方百计要在喜儿身上抹黑，编造她对黄世仁的幻想，胡唱什么“没法，只有依靠他，低头过日月”等等，绝不是偶然的，这是他们这一伙大叛徒灵魂的顽强表现，这是他们活命哲学的一次大暴露。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是“洋为中用”、“推陈出新”的好样板。它的重要功绩，不仅在于把歌剧中被歪曲了的农民形象，被歪曲了的主题思想，统统纠正过来，还它原来的面目；它还通过一系列生动的舞台艺术形象，集中地表现出马克思主义的“造反有理”的真理，从而锐利地揭露了文艺界黑线头目周扬的反动恶作剧，驳斥了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派对革命人民的污蔑以及他所鼓吹的阶级斗争熄灭论等无耻谰言，正确揭示了在反动统治阶级的沉重压迫下，我国劳动人民群众怎样掀起了反抗和斗争。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的指导下，经过广大革命同志的努力，我国京剧革命、芭蕾舞剧革命、交响乐革命取得了重大的胜利。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》等一批革命样板剧目的出现，是报春的红梅，它给芭蕾舞艺术开拓了一个新时代。它告诉我们，经过这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，一定会出现更多优秀的文艺作品，社会主义文学艺术必然会蓬勃兴起、百花齐放，出现一个崭新的面貌。鲁迅说得好：“没有冲破一切传统思想和手法的闯将，中国是不会有真的新文艺的。”为了要在文学艺术中创作出更多的好样板，我们必须勇往直前，和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧手法实行最彻底的决裂，再接再厉，千万不要忘记文学艺术领域中还存在着十分激烈、十分尖锐、十分复杂的阶级斗争，千万不能松懈斗志，要紧密地同广大工农兵群众相结合，进一步彻底批判以周扬、夏衍为代表的文艺黑线，彻底肃清他们的恶劣影响，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍文艺领域的各个阵地。
    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
