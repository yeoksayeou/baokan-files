In the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, Marxist-Leninists have achieved unity. The establishment of the Japan Communist Party (Leftist) Saga Prefecture Committee has been announced. The committee unanimously affirmed Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology for the revolutionary struggle.

According to a recent report by the Japanese newspaper *Chōshū Shinbun*, Marxist-Leninists in Saga Prefecture, with the core being the Japan Communist Party (Leftist) Mitsunabe District Committee, have, after several months of united struggle against imperialism and revisionism, achieved unity among all Marxist-Leninists in the prefecture. On June 8, they established the "Japan Communist Party (Leftist) Saga Prefecture Committee," marking a new stage in the revolutionary movement in Saga Prefecture.

At the founding meeting, the current situation and the tasks of communists were discussed.

The meeting unanimously affirmed Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology for the revolutionary struggle, and emphasized that the revolutionary left should actively engage in mass struggles against imperialism and revisionism.

The meeting believed that the issue of friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China is a crucial political line issue both internationally and domestically.

The meeting unanimously agreed that revisionism is an enemy of the communist movement and the people, and must be thoroughly smashed and resolutely defeated.

The meeting elected the leadership of the Japan Communist Party (Leftist) Saga Prefecture Committee.

So far, in addition to Saga Prefecture, the Japan Communist Party (Leftist) prefectural committees have also been established in Yamaguchi Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture.
