The Indian reactionary government has wildly instigated an extremely serious incident by attacking our embassy. The Chinese government and people are closely monitoring the situation and will resolutely counter the Indian reactionary government's despicable actions.

	NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) — The Indian reactionary government on June 16 instigated a mob to storm the Chinese Embassy in India, causing severe damage and injuring several embassy staff members who bravely defended the Chinese national flag. This incident is a grave violation of international norms and has reached an extremely serious level.

	This incident is a continuation and escalation of the Indian reactionary government's despicable retaliatory actions against the Chinese authorities' handling of the Indian spy Lu Guannan case. The Indian reactionaries have incurred another debt of blood from the Chinese people and have once again exposed their extremely reactionary and shameless face to the world.

	Due to the Indian government deploying a large number of military and police to tightly surround the Chinese Embassy, the embassy staff's freedom of movement has been restricted, and communication with Beijing has been cut off. Currently, only foreign news agencies' reports can be used to understand the incident's details.

	According to Reuters, a large mob of Indian rioters attacked the Chinese Embassy, storming into the embassy compound. Approximately seven Chinese embassy staff members were injured while attempting to defend the Chinese national flag on a tall flagpole near the main gate. Some of them were hit by stones and beaten, with some bleeding. The rioters tore down and shredded the flag.

	Reports also indicate that the rioters set fire to vehicles in the embassy garage and an exhibition window outside the embassy, smashing many windows of the embassy building.

	On June 14, the Indian government unreasonably forced the Chinese Embassy's First Secretary, Chen Luzhi, to leave India immediately and declared the Third Secretary, Xie Chenghao, as "persona non grata," demanding he leave India within a specified time. The Chinese government firmly rejected this absurd action on June 15. Following this, the Indian reactionary government began plotting further harassment of the Chinese Embassy staff. According to the Indian News Agency's report on June 15, the Indian Foreign Ministry that day "considered what steps could be taken to implement its decision regarding the two Chinese diplomats." The agency stated, "Once they appear outside the embassy, they will be subject to ordinary laws."

	Starting from the morning of June 15, Chinese Embassy staff members faced rough obstruction and illegal searches by Indian police when leaving the embassy. The Chinese Embassy that day lodged a protest with the Indian Foreign Ministry.

	However, in the evening of June 15, when the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires, Chen Zhaoyuan, left the embassy for normal diplomatic activities, he was again obstructed by Indian armed military and police. They pointed bayonets at the car, insisting on conducting an illegal search. After their unreasonable demands were firmly rejected by the Chinese diplomats, a group of organized rioters threw stones and bricks. The Chinese diplomats immediately lodged the strongest protest with Indian Foreign Ministry officials and sternly pointed out that the Indian government would be fully responsible for this serious provocation and violation of the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires and obstruction of his normal diplomatic activities. The Chinese diplomats resolutely rejected the Indian side's unreasonable demand to search the car.

	The Chinese government and people are closely monitoring the actions of the Indian reactionary government and will resolutely counter any despicable actions it may take to damage bilateral relations and harass Chinese diplomats. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The Indian reactionary government will be fully responsible for all the consequences of its reactionary actions.

    印度反动政府疯狂制造袭击我大使馆的极端严重事件
    中国政府和人民密切注意事态发展
    将坚决反击印度反动政府卑劣行径
    新华社十六日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府十六日竟然指使大批暴徒，冲入中国驻印度大使馆，疯狂地进行破坏，打伤英勇地卫护中国国旗的使馆工作人员多名，造成了破坏国际关系准则的极端严重的事件。
    这个事件，是连日来印度反动政府对中国有关当局处理印度间谍鲁冠南案件所采取的卑劣的报复行动的继续和发展。印度反动派制造这个事件，欠下了中国人民又一笔血债，并且在世界舆论面前又一次暴露出它的极端反动的无耻嘴脸。
    由于印度政府出动大批军警严密包围中国大使馆，剥夺使馆人员外出行动的自由，使馆同北京的联络中断。目前只能据外国通讯社的消息报道事件的经过。
    据路透社报道：大批印度暴徒袭击了中国大使馆，冲进了使馆的院子。大约有七名中国使馆工作人员在设法保卫使馆主门附近一根很高的旗杆上的中国国旗时，被石块打着了，还挨了打。其中有些人流了血。暴徒们把那面国旗扯了下来撕碎。
    据报道，暴徒们还放火烧了大使馆汽车房里的车辆和使馆外面的一个展览橱窗，打碎了使馆建筑物的许多窗子。
    印度反动政府在十四日无理强迫中国大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直立即离印，并且宣布三等秘书谢承浩为“不受欢迎的人”，强迫他限期离印。中国政府在十五日表示断然拒绝这种荒诞做法。这以后，印度反动政府就紧张地谋划进一步迫害中国大使馆人员。据印度报业托辣斯十五日报道，印度外交部当天“考虑可以采取什么步骤来执行它作出的关于这两名中国外交官的决定”。这家通讯社说，“他们一旦在大使馆外出现，就要受普通法律的制裁”。
    从十五日早上开始，中国大使馆人员离馆外出时，就受到印度警察的粗暴的阻拦和非法搜查。中国大使馆当天向印度外交部提出了抗议。
    但是，十五日晚间，当中国大使馆临时代办陈肇源离馆外出进行正常的外交活动时，又被印度武装军警阻拦。他们用刺刀对着汽车，硬要进行非法检查。当他们的无理要求遭到中国外交人员的严正拒绝后，一批有组织的暴徒就用石头土块砸过来。中国外交人员当场向印度外交部官员提出最强烈抗议，并且严正指出，印度政府要对这一严重挑衅和侵犯中国代办的外交特权和阻拦他进行正常外交活动的严重事件负全部责任。中国外交人员坚决拒绝了印方检查汽车的无理要求。
    中国政府和人民正在密切注意印度反动政府的行动，并且将对它可能采取的一切破坏两国关系、迫害中国外交人员的卑劣行为，进行坚决的反击。中国人民是不好惹的。印度反动政府要对它倒行逆施的反动行径的一切后果负完全的责任。
