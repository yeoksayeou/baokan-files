The Arab states are engaged in a serious struggle against the aggression and threats of American imperialism and its lackey, Israel. At this critical moment, the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, the weekly *New Times*, published an article that maliciously attacked China regarding the situation in the Middle East. It slandered that the Chinese people, who claim to be loyal friends of the Arab people, are at the same time inciting them to ignite the flames of struggle in the Near East, and thus objectively aligning with the imperialist provocateurs. The wild and reckless statements of the Soviet revisionist clique do not in the slightest damage the principled stance of the Chinese people in resolutely supporting the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. Instead, they expose the ugly face of the Soviet revisionists, who pretend to support the Arab people but actually betray them.

According to the logic of the Soviet revisionist clique, the Chinese people, as loyal friends of the Arab people, should not support the Arab people's just cause of opposing American imperialism and Zionism. Even when Arab states are facing the aggression of American imperialism and its lackey, Israel, they should not support the armed struggle of the Arab people against aggression. Otherwise, it would be aligning with the imperialist provocateurs and committing the crime of "igniting the flames of struggle in the Near East." Do the Soviet revisionist masters think that only by deliberately ignoring the fact that American imperialism is using Israel to invade Arab states, peddling the so-called "spirit of Tashkent," advocating for Arab-Israeli "reconciliation," and suppressing the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people, can one be a "loyal friend" of the Arab people? Or do they think that only by directing Israel to invade Arab states, while demanding that the Arab people adopt an attitude of "restraint" in the face of armed aggression, can one be a "loyal friend" of the Arab people?

The Soviet revisionist clique is not only attacking China but also attacking the Arab people. According to the traitors of the Soviet revisionists, the Arab people igniting the flames of struggle is not a just anti-imperialist action but is instead being incited by others. This is the most malicious slander against the Arab people!

Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique has been trying hard to put on a show of supporting the Arab people. However, even the Israeli reactionaries can see through your act. Israeli political figures point out without hesitation that your performance is merely to "win the sympathy of the Arab world."

Currently, the root cause of the tense situation in the Middle East is the use of Israel by American and British imperialism to invade Arab states. Yet, you are colluding with American and British imperialism, making political deals, and repeatedly expressing your "willingness to exert influence to calm the tense situation." In essence, you are aligning with American and British imperialism to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. You truly deserve to be called the "loyal friends" of American and British imperialism.

The Soviet revisionist clique's support for the Arab people is false, but their betrayal is real. Chairman Mao said, "Friends have true and false, but through practice, one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend." Your tricks will ultimately be thoroughly exposed by the Arab people.

### 假朋友的真面目

    假朋友的真面目
    阿拉伯国家正在为反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略威胁进行着严重斗争。在这个时候，苏修领导集团的喉舌《新时代》周刊发表了一篇文章，就中东局势恶毒攻击中国，胡说什么中国人民“自称是阿拉伯人民的忠实朋友，同时却又号召他们在近东燃起斗争的火焰，因此在客观上就同帝国主义挑拨者结成一伙。”苏修集团这种狂言乱语，丝毫无损于中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的严正立场，倒是恰恰暴露出他们对阿拉伯人民假支持、真出卖的丑恶嘴脸。
    按照苏修集团的逻辑，作为阿拉伯人民忠实朋友的中国人民，是不应当支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的正义事业的，就是在阿拉伯国家面对着美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略的时候，也不应该支持阿拉伯人民反侵略的武装斗争，否则就是“同帝国主义挑拨者结成一伙”，就是犯了“在近东燃起斗争的火焰”的大罪。苏修集团的老爷们，难道只有象你们那样，故意撇开美帝国主义利用以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的事实，大肆贩卖所谓“塔什干精神”的黑货，鼓吹阿拉伯—以色列“和解”，扼杀阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争，才算是阿拉伯人民的“忠实朋友”吗？或者只有象美英帝国主义那样，指使以色列对阿拉伯国家进行侵略，而却要阿拉伯人民在武装侵略威胁面前采取“克制”态度，才是阿拉伯人民的“忠实朋友”吗？
    苏修集团在这里不仅是攻击中国，而且是在攻击阿拉伯人民。照苏修叛徒说来，阿拉伯人民燃起斗争的火焰，并不是反帝的正义行动，而是什么受人煽动。这是对阿拉伯人民最恶毒的污蔑！
    最近，苏修集团竭力装出一副支持阿拉伯人民的样子。但是，你们这种假支持的姿态，连以色列反动派也一眼看穿。以色列的政界人士毫不在乎地指出，你们的造作不过是为了“赢得阿拉伯世界的同情”而已。
    目前，中东紧张局势的根源是美英帝国主义利用以色列侵略阿拉伯国家，而你们却同美英帝国主义明勾暗搭，大做政治交易，一再表示“愿意施加影响使紧张局势平静下来”。说穿了，就是你们同美英帝国主义结成一伙，要把阿拉伯人民燃起的反帝斗争火焰扑灭下去。你们真不愧是美英帝国主义的“忠实朋友”。
    苏修集团对阿拉伯人民，支持是假的，出卖是真的。毛主席说：“朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。”你们的这套把戏，终究要被阿拉伯人民彻底识破。
