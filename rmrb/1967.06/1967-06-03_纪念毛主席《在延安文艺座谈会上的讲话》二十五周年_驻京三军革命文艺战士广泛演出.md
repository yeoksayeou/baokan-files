Revolutionary cultural troops of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Beijing have been performing widely for over half a month to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They have performed in Tiananmen Square, factories, rural areas, and military camps in the capital. They enthusiastically sing the praises of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With their artistic weapons, they severely criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, greatly inspiring the more than ten million revolutionary masses who watched their performances. Their performances are a great success, flying high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The units and revolutionary mass organizations participating in this performance include: the Navy Political Department Troupe, the Red Rebel Fleet of the Military Band, the Revolutionary Committee of the Air Force Political Department Troupe, the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Military Region Friendship Troupe, the Revolutionary United Front of the Beijing Military Region Air Force Troupe, the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Artillery Star Fire Troupe, the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Military Region Military Band, the Red Flag Rebel Team of the August 1st Sports Team, the Rebel Team of the Air Force Sports Team, and the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Military Region Sports Team.

The revolutionary cultural troops of the three services, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have staged a large-scale song and dance performance: "Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Publication of Chairman Mao's Brilliant Work 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.'" This performance fully praises the great victories of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line over the past 25 years; it deeply exposes and criticizes the counter-revolutionary crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line and its mastermind—the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

Chairman Mao personally revised three times the "Summary of the Conference on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing." The revolutionary cultural troops of the three services immediately staged another large-scale song and dance performance, "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary and Art Line," celebrating the brilliant victories achieved over the past year under the guidance of the "Summary," and enthusiastically praising Comrade Jiang Qing, who has made special contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
