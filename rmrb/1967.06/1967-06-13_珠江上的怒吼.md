Seamen and workers in the Guangzhou region, with a glorious anti-imperialist tradition, today boarded dozens of ships on the Pearl River to hold a massive waterborne demonstration, expressing their profound indignation at the new bloody atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong.

Today, the Pearl River was adorned with red flags and echoed with roaring voices. The demonstration fleet sounded their horns in unison, with giant portraits of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao prominently displayed at the bows of the ships. The sides of the ships were plastered with quotations from Chairman Mao and large banners protesting the fascist atrocities of the British authorities. The demonstration fleet, majestic and formidable, sailed through the Pearl River, which cuts across the heart of Guangzhou. A red barrier stretched across the river. The enraged seamen waved their flags and repeatedly shouted slogans: "Resolutely counter the provocations of British imperialism!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with British imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Salute to the heroic struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong!" As the fleet passed by the Haizhu Bridge, the Changdi, and the Sandu River, which was once occupied by British imperialism, the revolutionary masses on the shore also shouted slogans, and the roar of anger echoed across the river like the surging waves of the Pearl River.

Before the demonstration, the seamen held a rally. The presider at the rally strongly condemned British imperialism's heinous crimes of persisting in opposing the Chinese people and our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. He said, "The more brutal British imperialism becomes, the more resolutely the working class and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon will defend and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and launch a powerful struggle against British imperialism and its violence."

Representatives of the "South China Hero Ship," old workers who participated in the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike, and representatives of seamen sailing on international routes all spoke at the rally, unanimously declaring that they would thoroughly settle accounts with the heinous crimes of British imperialism's more than a century of aggression against China.

    珠江上的怒吼
    据新华社广州十二日电　具有反帝光荣传统的广州地区海员工人，怀着无比愤怒的心情，今天乘着数十艘船在珠江上举行声势浩大的水上示威游行，声讨港英当局制造新的血腥暴行。
    今天，珠江上红旗招展，吼声震天，示威的船队汽笛齐鸣，船头上竖立着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，船的两侧贴着毛主席语录和抗议港英当局法西斯暴行的大幅标语。游行船队威风凛凛，浩浩荡荡地通过横贯广州市区的珠江江面，珠江上出现一道红色的长城。愤怒的海员工人挥舞手中的小旗，不断振臂高呼：“坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅！”“打倒美帝！打倒英帝！打倒苏修！”“向英勇斗争的香港爱国同胞致敬！”当船队驶进海珠桥、长堤和曾经被英帝霸占的沙面江面时，岸上的革命群众也高呼口号，怒吼声连成一片，犹如珠江的滚滚怒涛。
    游行示威以前，海员们举行了大会。大会主持人在讲话中强烈谴责英帝国主义坚持与中国人民和香港爱国同胞为敌的滔天罪行。他说，英帝国主义越是残暴，我港九工人阶级和爱国同胞就越加坚决地捍卫、宣传毛泽东思想，展开强大的反英抗暴斗争。
    “南海英雄船”的代表、曾经参加过省港大罢工的老工人和航行在国际航线的海员代表，也都在大会上讲话，一致表示要彻底清算一百多年来英帝国主义侵略中国的滔天罪行。
