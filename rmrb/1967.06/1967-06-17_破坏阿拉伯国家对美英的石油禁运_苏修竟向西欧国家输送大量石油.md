The Soviet revisionist leadership is taking advantage of the Arab states' oil embargo against U.S. and British imperialism to sell its own oil to Western European countries. Their aim is to sabotage the Arab states' oil embargo against U.S. and British imperialism, while also profiting from the situation to serve their own narrow national interests.

According to a report by the British *Financial Times* on June 16, "The Soviet Union is making efforts to take advantage of the Arab states' embargo and blockade of the Suez Canal to sell large quantities of oil in Western Europe." The newspaper said that the British government has traditionally believed that allowing the Soviet Union to compete with Arab oil in the Middle East oil industry would be against British interests, as British companies have significant stakes in the region. However, if the Arab states' actions lead to a shortage of oil, it is possible that the Soviet Union's oil will be allowed into the country.

The *Daily Telegraph*'s correspondent in New York also cited a report from the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle* on June 16, stating, "There are indications that Russia is trying to 'seize the oil market previously held by the Arabs.'"

These revelations by British and American newspapers have been confirmed by a statement from the British Ministry of Power. The ministry acknowledged that the Soviet Union has applied for a permit to export oil to Britain.

    破坏阿拉伯国家对美英的石油禁运
    苏修竟向西欧国家输送大量石油
    据新华社十六日讯  苏联修正主义领导集团正在利用阿拉伯国家对美英帝国主义禁运石油的机会，把自己的石油卖给西欧国家，其目的是为了阴谋破坏阿拉伯国家对美英帝国主义的石油禁运，同时从中捞取实惠，为其民族利己主义服务。
    据英国《金融时报》十六日透露：“苏联努力利用阿拉伯国家实行禁运和封锁苏伊士运河的机会，正在西欧大量出售石油。”这家报纸说，过去英国政府一向认为，由于英国公司在中东石油工业中有很大的利益，如果让苏联同阿拉伯的石油竞争，是违背英国的利益的。但是，如果由于阿拉伯国家的行动而发生了缺乏石油的危险，就可能准许苏联石油输入这个国家。
    《每日电讯报》驻纽约记者十六日也援引纽约的《商业日报》报道说：“有迹象表明，俄国试图
  ‘为自己取得过去属于阿拉伯人的石油市场’。”
    英美报纸的这种透露，已经为英国动力部所发表的声明所证实。动力部的声明承认，苏联已经申请向英国输出石油的许可证。
