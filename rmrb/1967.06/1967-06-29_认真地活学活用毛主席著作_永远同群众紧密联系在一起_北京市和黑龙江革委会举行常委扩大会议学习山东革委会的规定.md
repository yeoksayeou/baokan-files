The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of its standing committee members on June 26 and 27 to seriously study and discuss the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" and the editorial "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology" from the *Red Flag* magazine. The meeting passed the decision "Seriously Study and Resolutely Implement the 'Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee' to Realize the Revolutionization of the Leading Cadres," and also passed regulations on thrift for revolution.

All standing committee members who attended the meeting, after serious study, unanimously agreed that the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" and the editorial from the *Red Flag* magazine embody the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to our Party cadres. They are important documents that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The meeting believed that after the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and established the revolutionary committees, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines has not ended. This struggle ultimately comes down to the issue of power, whether the proletariat will consolidate proletarian dictatorship or the bourgeoisie will overthrow proletarian dictatorship. The bourgeoisie, in their attempt to seize power back from the proletariat and carry out restoration activities, use both soft and hard tactics. Besides exerting pressure and causing destruction from outside the revolutionary power and revolutionary ranks, they also attempt to subvert from within, using bourgeois ideology to corrupt the proletarian revolutionary factions, especially the leadership core. After the proletarian revolutionary factions seize power and transition to being in power, the issue of preventing the infiltration of bourgeois ideology becomes extremely important. The ten measures proposed by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee have great guiding significance in solving this problem. The ten measures of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are not trivial matters of personal conduct but major political principles. They are related to whether Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can be executed, whether proletarian character can be maintained, and whether proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated.

Through discussion, all standing committee members of the municipal revolutionary committee resolutely declared that the ten measures of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are not only completely applicable to Beijing but are also urgently needed. All members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee must resolutely and without any compromise implement these measures.

The attendees, based on their personal experiences, repeatedly emphasized that seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind, is the fundamental key to seriously transforming one's style of work. It is also the fundamental guarantee to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and prevent capitalist restoration. We must establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao in all aspects and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. All our words and actions must adhere to whether they conform to Mao Zedong Thought as the highest standard. All members of the municipal revolutionary committee must take the lead in seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, achieving daily study and daily application. We must study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our guiding principles, thoroughly criticize the "self" and establish the "public," and do a good job in ideological revolutionization. At present, all members of the municipal revolutionary committee must, on the basis of studying Chairman Mao's works, use the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" as a mirror, further carry out rectification, conduct criticism and self-criticism among themselves, and especially welcome criticisms from the revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations of the entire city regarding the members of the municipal revolutionary committee.

The meeting unanimously passed the decision of the municipal revolutionary committee "Seriously Study and Resolutely Implement the 'Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee' to Realize the Revolutionization of the Leading Cadres," requiring all revolutionary mass organizations in the city to, in accordance with the spirit of the decision, formulate specific measures to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and seriously transform their style of work based on their own situations, and resolutely implement them.

The meeting, after discussion, also passed the "Regulations on Thrift for Revolution by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee."

The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of its standing committee members on June 26 to seriously study and discuss the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" and the editorial "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology" from the *Red Flag* magazine. The meeting made a resolution to study the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" and formulated the "Several Regulations on Certain Systems by the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee" in conjunction with the situation in Heilongjiang Province.

At the expanded meeting of the provincial revolutionary committee, everyone engaged in heated discussions and reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings in his "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China": "We must always maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impatience, and we must always maintain the style of hard struggle." Everyone unanimously agreed that the several regulations of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are an important and significant document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionary factions, in order to properly exercise power, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought; all members of the revolutionary committee must appear in the posture of ordinary laborers and forever maintain close ties with the masses.

The attendees, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, carried out the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined their thoughts and work. Everyone believed that seriously studying the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee" and resolutely implementing the "Several Regulations on Certain Systems by the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee" is a serious political issue. It must be elevated to the level of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and it must be elevated to the level of consolidating proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration. The speakers unanimously declared that they must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously promote ideological revolutionization, and turn Heilongjiang Province into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The attendees of the expanded meeting of the provincial revolutionary committee believed that the system of revolutionary committee staff members taking turns participating in physical labor and going deep into the grassroots is an important guarantee to promote the revolutionization of thoughts, work, life, and style, to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and to avoid the production of revisionism. Currently, the provincial revolutionary committee has decided that fourteen standing committee members and heads of various departments will lead 112 office workers to go to factories and countryside to participate in production labor. Additionally, nine standing committee members and heads of various departments will lead 166 office workers to go to factories, stores, and rural communes and production teams to inspect work, conduct investigations, and summarize experiences.

    认真地活学活用毛主席著作  永远同群众紧密联系在一起
    北京市和黑龙江革委会举行常委扩大会议学习山东革委会的规定
    新华社二十八日讯  北京市革命委员会六月二十六、二十七日举行常委扩大会议，认真学习和热烈讨论了《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》，通过了《认真学习和坚决贯彻〈山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定〉，实现领导班子革命化》的决定，并且通过了关于节约闹革命的规定。
    参加会议的全体常委，经过认真学习，一致认为，《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章，体现了我们伟大领袖毛主席对我们党的干部的一贯教导，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的重要文件。
    会议认为，无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺了权，建立了革命委员会以后，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。这些斗争归结到一点，就是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。资产阶级向无产阶级反夺权，进行复辟活动，总是使用软硬两手，除了在革命政权和革命队伍的外部施加压力、进行破坏以外，还要从内部搞颠覆，用资产阶级思想腐蚀无产阶级革命派，特别是腐蚀无产阶级革命派的领导核心。无产阶级革命派夺取了政权，转变到当权的地位以后，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的问题就成为极端重要的问题。山东省革命委员会提出的十条措施，对于解决这个问题具有十分重大的指导意义。山东省革命委员会的十条措施，绝不是生活小节，而是重大的政治性的原则问题，是关系到能不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，能不能保持无产阶级本色的问题，也是关系到能不能巩固无产阶级专政的问题。
    通过讨论，市革命委员会的全体常委坚决表示：山东省革命委员会规定的十条措施，对于我们北京不仅完全适用，而且迫切需要。北京市革命委员会全体成员必须坚决地不折不扣地贯彻执行。
    到会的同志，根据自己的亲身体会，一再强调：活学活用毛主席著作，在自己的头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是认真转变作风的根本关键，也是抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀，防止资本主义复辟的根本保证。我们必须在各个方面树立毛主席的绝对权威，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们的一切言论行动都必须以是否符合毛泽东思想为最高准则。市革命委员会全体成员必须带头活学活用毛主席著作，做到天天学，天天用。要把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞好思想革命化。在当前，市革命委员会全体成员要在学习毛主席著作的基础上，对照《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，进一步开展整风，互相之间开展批评和自我批评，特别欢迎全市革命群众和革命群众组织对市革命委员会成员提出批评意见。
    会议一致通过了市革命委员会《认真学习和坚决贯彻〈山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定〉，实现领导班子革命化》的决定，要求全市各革命群众组织都要根据决定的精神，结合自己的情况，提出关于防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，认真转变作风的具体措施，并且坚决执行。
    会议经过讨论，还通过了《北京市革命委员会关于节约闹革命的规定》。
    新华社哈尔滨二十八日电　黑龙江省革命委员会二十六日召开常委扩大会议，认真学习和讨论了《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》，作出了学习《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》的决议，并结合黑龙江省情况制定了《黑龙江省革命委员会关于若干制度的规定》。
    在省革命委员会的常委扩大会议上，大家进行了热烈的讨论，并重新学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》中的伟大教导：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”大家一致认为，山东省革命委员会的若干规定，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、具有重要意义的好文件。无产阶级革命派为了掌好权、用好权，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威；革命委员会全体成员必须以普通劳动者的姿态出现，永远同群众紧密地联系在一起。
    到会的同志按照毛主席的教导，发扬批评与自我批评精神，检查了思想和工作。大家认为，认真学习《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，坚决贯彻《黑龙江省革命委员会关于若干制度的规定》，是一个严肃的政治问题。要把它提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识，要把它提高到巩固无产阶级政权、防止资本主义复辟的高度来认识。发言的人一致表示，一定要认真活学活用毛主席著作，不断促进思想革命化，把黑龙江省办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    参加省革命委员会扩大会议的同志们认为，革命委员会工作人员实行轮流参加体力劳动和深入基层的制度，是促进思想、工作、生活、作风革命化，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，避免产生修正主义的重要保证。现在，省革命委员会已经决定，由十四名常委及各委（室）负责人带领一百一十二名机关工作人员，分别下厂下乡参加生产劳动。另外九名常委以及各委（室）负责人带领一百六十六名机关工作人员，分别深入到工厂、商店及农村社、队，检查工作，调查研究，总结经验。
