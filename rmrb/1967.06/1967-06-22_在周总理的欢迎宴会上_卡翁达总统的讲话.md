Premier Mr. Zhou, Vice-Premier, Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen,

First of all, allow me to express my great joy at being here. Premier Zhou, you are undoubtedly aware that since our independence, I have always wanted to visit your great country. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, this visit has not been realized. In 1965, I was unable to come, so I sent a friendly delegation led by my Minister of Agriculture. Incidentally, the Minister of Agriculture is also present today. In 1966, due to the crisis caused by the illegal seizure of power in Rhodesia, I had to postpone my visit again. Therefore, I sent a high-level delegation led by Vice-President Kammanga, which included the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Of course, these delegations do not include the many other Zambian delegations that have been sent on trade or other missions. Although the crisis continues, I have decided to make this visit, to meet the Chinese people, to exchange views on issues of mutual concern, and to fulfill my mission since independence.

Premier Zhou, on behalf of my wife, my colleagues accompanying me, and in my own name, I would like to express our deep and sincere appreciation and gratitude for the magnificent reception given to us by the Chinese people in this great city. This spontaneous response is great, deeply moving, and truly friendly. I am very happy to say that on our part, I have brought the warm greetings and brotherly regards of the Zambian people to you and the Chinese people.

It may be appropriate here to express the heartfelt congratulations of the Zambian people on China's recent successful hydrogen bomb test. This is a great achievement of a great nation. It has ushered in a new era for the People's Republic of China in maintaining world peace and security. In this new era, China's influence will to a great extent determine the future of mankind: whether mankind will continue to exist peacefully and happily on this earth or be destroyed. Premier Zhou, your assurance that your country will use this new weapon only for defensive purposes, and your government's solemn declaration that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances and at any time, are most welcome. This is also the case for all other peace-loving countries in the world, including those that possess these dangerous weapons.

Although my government and people fully support the principle of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, it is difficult for me to support the position in international affairs that the fate of mankind is entirely in the hands of one or two countries that monopolize these weapons of destruction. The fate of mankind in this world should not be in the hands of a few privileged countries or a few great powers, but should be a concern and responsibility of all countries. Therefore, unless the problem of complete and thorough disarmament is solved in a manner consistent with our efforts to achieve true peace for all mankind, it is not safe to allow a few countries to continue to monopolize these weapons of destruction for their national interests.

I reaffirm that today's cause is more than ever for all mankind. Some great powers have promised not to use nuclear weapons, and these promises may be sincere, but their actions and policies cast doubt on their solemn declarations. Nothing guarantees that future generations will continue to adhere to these declarations. If future generations do not adhere to them, the consequences for those who oppose putting their fingers on the nuclear trigger but lack practical means of self-defense will be tragic.

Peace and China's Seat in the United Nations

The achievements and status of the People's Republic of China in the world further indicate the importance of its active contribution to peace and stability in the world. Unless there is full cooperation and active participation of the 700 million Chinese people, our quest for a peaceful world will not be successful, and it will not be possible to establish a good world order that makes human life meaningful. Excluding the People's Republic of China from the United Nations and saying that the United Nations is a world organization aimed at maintaining international peace and security and eliminating the roots of war is a regrettable and serious mistake.

This unfortunate event will inevitably have tragic consequences. Since Zambia's independence, I have always emphasized this point. Now many people must realize that whether or not China is in the United Nations, it will not fail to influence the cause of world peace and security. It must be accepted as an equal member of the international family. Zambia joined the United Nations based on the belief that the United Nations has the ability to ensure the maintenance of peace and security, for all mankind and peace among mankind. All independent sovereign states have the right to participate in determining the fate of the world and the future of mankind through this organization. The absence of China in the United Nations makes it impossible for many major issues related to peace to be reflected accurately from the appropriate angle. It is not possible to expect 700 million people to obey any major resolutions passed by an organization they do not recognize.

If we believe in the equality of mankind and nations, we must put this belief into practice. There can be harmony with equality and justice, and in harmony, there can be actual cooperation and understanding, which are the permanent foundations of peace, unity, and the progress of the people we all serve.

Friendship

Some countries in the world hope that Zambia will develop friendships with the minority regimes in Southern Africa—South Africa, the rebel regime of Ian Smith, and the Portuguese-controlled Mozambique and Angola. However, our principles do not allow such despicable practices. The concept of friendship we can accept is based on the ideal of common humanity, human dignity, and equality, regardless of color, race, belief, and status, and is based on mutual respect. Colonialism and its twin sister, racial discrimination, are incompatible with our basic beliefs and ideals. The minority regimes in South Africa, Southwest Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, and Angola consider me and my non-white compatriots to be less than human, while they themselves are superior and privileged. Any friendship established with them cannot be based on honesty, equality, human dignity, and mutual respect.

We Zambians now feel that it is very good to be self-governing. We Zambians believe in human dignity, whether we are Zambians or Vietnamese, and therefore we strongly believe that just as it is good for Zambians to be self-governing, it is equally good and appropriate for the Vietnamese to be self-governing. We have chosen our own government, and we feel that we have the right to do so and have the opportunity to choose our own government, our own political, economic, and social way of life, which is the best. We strongly believe that just as Zambia belongs to us, Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese people themselves should decide who can be their prime minister and president, what political system, economic system, and social system to adopt; and not have other countries impose their will on them. Vietnam is for the Vietnamese people. It is a known fact that no powerful country can expect to conquer the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people will certainly win. Military force is not the solution to the political situation in Vietnam, this is a political realism. Those who wage war in Vietnam to oppress the Vietnamese people must know that the Vietnamese people, like the Chinese people, have a long history of resisting all imperialist and colonialist exploitation.

Regarding the Middle East issue, Premier Zhou, I also agree with your view on the Vietnam issue, that is, unless the parties concerned withdraw their troops to the positions before the outbreak of the war, there is no way to solve the current crisis in the Middle East. There is no other way. Those who have other ideas are only wasting precious time, and this will result in extremely tragic consequences of loss of life. Undoubtedly, the Arab people will eventually win a decisive victory.

Premier Zhou, I do not want to talk about the depressing and volatile situation in Southern Africa today. I will talk about it later. Today I can only say that if we love not only our compatriots but also mankind, we should see the real danger of the inhuman policies pursued by the minority regimes. In Zambia, we hope to form the best democratic system for ourselves, in which the people govern and formulate the basic policies most in line with their interests. In this way, leaders like me and others will implement the people's policies, and we serve them. As an independent and sovereign country, we do not accept the policies pre-determined by other countries, but we follow the will and wishes of the people. Our active policy of non-alignment means that we can handle all our problems without basic prejudice, based on the interests of our people and our sincere belief in the requirements and dignity of mankind.

Premier Zhou, although vast land, sea, and sky separate China and Zambia, our two peoples are getting to know each other, understanding each other's way of life and problems. Understanding comes from a full understanding of each other's way of life and problems, and from understanding comes love, friendship, and cooperation. Premier Zhou, all these factors are important in developing our relations, and unless everyone in the world makes a sincere effort, the international situation cannot be improved and stabilized. This is our mission, and the people of Zambia are working with other peace-loving nations to achieve this.

Let me say again, I am very happy to be here and look forward to fruitful discussions. Thank you.

Premier Zhou, distinguished ministers, guests, ladies, and gentlemen,

Now, please stand up with me,

To the health of the great leader Chairman Mao,
To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai,
To the great unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa,
To the great unity of the peoples of the world,
To the health of the great people of the People's Republic of China,
To the enduring and strong friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia,

Cheers!

### 在周总理的欢迎宴会上  卡翁达总统的讲话

    在周总理的欢迎宴会上
    卡翁达总统的讲话总理先生阁下，副总理阁下，部长阁下诸位阁下，女士们，先生们：
    首先，让我讲一下，我到这里来是多么高兴。总理先生无疑是知道的，自独立以来，我一直想来访问你们伟大的国家。可是不幸由于种种情况，访问未能实现。一九六五年我不能够来，所以我派出了由我的农业部长率领的友好代表团。顺便提一句，农业部长今天也在场。一九六六年，由于在津巴布韦非法夺取政权造成的危机，使得我必须又一次推迟我的访问。所以我派出由副总统卡曼加率领的有外交部长参加的高级代表团。
    当然，以上代表团不包括在以前所派遣的其他许多有关贸易或其他使命的赞比亚代表团。当然，现在虽然危机还在继续，我已决定进行这次访问，会见中国人民，就双方共同关心的问题交换看法，和完成我在独立后的使命。
    总理先生，对于中国人民在这雄伟的城市中所给予我们的盛大接待，我愿代表我的夫人，随行的同事们，并以我自己的名义，表达我们的深切和诚挚的欣赏和感谢。这种自发的反应是伟大的，是极为感人的，是真正友好的。我很高兴地说，在我们方面，我已把赞比亚人民的热情和兄弟般的问候带给了你们和中国人民。
    在这里对于中国最近爆炸氢弹的伟大胜利，表达赞比亚人民的衷心祝贺，也许是合适的。这是一个伟大国家的伟大成就。它使中华人民共和国在维护世界和平和安全所起作用方面进入了一个崭新的时代，在这个新时代里，中国的影响将在很大程度上决定人类的事业，即：不是继续和平和幸福地存在于地球上，就是毁灭。总理先生，你所作的保证，即贵国只将这一新武器用于防御目的，以及贵国政府关于中国在任何时候和任何情况下都不会首先使用核武器的庄严声明是十分值得欢迎的。对于全世界其他热爱和平的国家，包括掌握这种危险武器的国家在内，也是这样的。
    尽管我的政府和人民完全支持不扩散核武器的原则，但是在国际事务中我很难支持下述立场，即：人类的命运完全由一、两个垄断毁灭性武器的国家来掌握。这个世界上的人类的命运决不应当由少数有特权的国家或少数大国来掌握，而必须由一切国家来关心和负责。因此，除非全面彻底裁军的问题能用和我们为实现全人类真正的和平而努力的任务相适应的方式加以解决，否则让少数国家为了它们的民族利益而继续垄断这种毁灭性的火器是不安全的。
    我重申，今天的事业比过去任何时候都更是为着全人类的。有些大国保证不使用核武器，这些保证可能是真诚的，但是这些大国的行动和政策使它们的庄严宣言蒙上怀疑的阴影。没有任何东西保证后代会继续遵守这些宣言。如果后代不予遵守，那么对于那些反对把手指放在核扳机上的又缺乏实际的自卫手段的人们来说，其后果将是悲惨的。
    和平和中国在联合国的席位
    中华人民共和国所取得的成就和她在世界上的地位更加表明了她对世界上的和平与稳定作出积极贡献的重要性。除非有七亿中国人民的充分合作和全力参预，我们寻求和平世界便不能获得成功，便不可能建立起使人类生活得有意义的良好世界秩序。把中华人民共和国排除在联合国之外，而又说联合国是一个旨在维护国际和平与安全、消除战争根源的世界性组织，这是一个令人遗憾的重大的错误。
    这种不幸的事件必然要产生悲惨的结果。自从赞比亚独立以来，我一直强调这一点。现在许多人一定会认识到，不论中国是否在联合国里面，她不会不影响世界和平和安全的事业。必须接受她作为国际大家庭中的平等的一员。赞比亚加入联合国是基于这样的信念，即联合国有能力来保证维持和平和安全，为全人类和人类间的和平。所有独立的主权国家有权通过联合国这一机构参预决定世界的命运，决定人类未来。中国不在联合国内使许多有关和平的重大问题不能从适当的角度得到确切的反映。不能期望七亿人民去遵守他们所不承认的机构所通过的任何重大决议。
    如果我们相信人类和民族间的平等，我们就必须使这一信念付诸实施。有平等、公正，才有和谐，在和谐中才有实际合作和谅解，而合作和谅解是和平、团结和我们都在为之服务的老百姓的进步的永久的基础。
    友谊
    世界上有些国家希望赞比亚同南非洲的少数人政权——南非、伊恩·史密斯叛乱政权和仍在葡萄牙控制下的莫三鼻给和安哥拉——发展友谊。但是，我们的原则不允许这种卑劣的做法。我们能接受的友谊这个概念是建立在不分肤色、种族、信仰和身份的共同人道、人的尊严和平等这一理想的基础之上的，是建立在互相尊重的基础上的。殖民主义及其孪生姊妹和种族隔离是与我们的基本信念和理想不相容的。南非、西南非、罗得西亚、莫三鼻给和安哥拉的少数人政权认为我和我的非白种人同胞是连人也不如的，而他们自己则是高等的和享有特权的人。同他们之间建立的任何友谊都不可能是在诚实、平等、人类尊严和相互尊重的基础上的。
    我们赞比亚人现在感到能够自治是非常美好的。我们赞比亚人相信人的尊严，不管是赞比亚人也好，越南人也好，因此决不能把人们按遭遇来划分。因而我们强烈地认为：既然赞比亚人能够自治是美好的，那么越南人自治也是同样美好和适宜的。我们已经选择了自己的政府，我们觉得有权力这样做，有机会来选择我们自己的政府，我们自己的政治、经济、社会生活方式是最好最好不过的了。我们十分强烈地认为：正如赞比亚是属于我们的一样，越南是属于越南人民的，必须让越南人民自己来决定怎样的人可以当他们的总理和他们的总统，采用什么政体、什么政治制度、经济制度和社会制度；而不应该由别的国家把自己的意志强加在他们身上。越南是越南人民的。世界上没有一个强国能够指望征服越南人民，这是我们知道的一个事实。越南人民必然会胜利。军事力量不是对越南的政治，越南局势的解决办法，这是一个政治上的现实主义的问题。那些在越南进行战争以压迫越南人民的人必须知道：越南人民象中国人民一样，是有着长久的反抗一切帝国主义和殖民主义剥削的历史的人民。
    关于中东问题，总理先生，我也象在越南问题上一样同意您的意见，就是除非有关各方把他们的部队撤退到战事发生以前的阵地上，便无从解决目前中东的危机。此外别无其他办法。一切有其他想法的人只是在浪费宝贵的时间，而这样做就会造成生命损失的极其悲惨的后果。毫无疑问，阿拉伯人民终将赢得决定性的胜利。
    总理先生，我不想谈南非洲的令人难过的、一触即发的局势。以后我会谈的。今天我只能说，如果我们不但爱本国同胞，而且也爱人类的话，我们就应该看到少数人政权所奉行的惨无人道的政策所孕育着的实在的危险。在赞比亚，我们希望为自己形成民主的最好形式，在这种民主形式下，人民当政，并制定最符合于他们利益的基本政策。这样，象我这样的和其他一些领导人将执行人民的政策，我们是为他们服务的。作为一个独立和主权的国家，我们不接受其他国家预先制定的方针，而是听命于人民的意志和愿望。我们的积极的不结盟政策意味着我们能够不带基本偏见地、根据我国人民的利益和我们对人的要求和尊严的真诚信念来处理我们的所有问题。
    总理先生，中国和赞比亚之间横隔着广大的陆地、海洋和天空，但我们两国人民正在相互了解，认识对方的生活方式和问题。谅解产生于对对方生活方式和问题的充分了解，从谅解之中又产生爱、友情和合作。总理先生，这一切因素在发展我们关系时都是重要的，而且，除非我们世界上人人作出真诚的努力，国际局势便不能得到改善、不能稳定。这就是我们的使命，赞比亚人民正协同其它热爱和平的民族致力于此。
    让我再说一遍，我非常高兴地来到这里，并正期望着进行富有成果的讨论。谢谢。总理先生，尊敬的部长们，阁下，贵宾们，女士们和先生们，
    现在请你们站起来同我一起，
    为伟大的领袖毛主席的健康，
    为周恩来总理的健康，
    为亚非人民的大团结，
    为世界人民的大团结，
    为中华人民共和国伟大人民的健康，
    为中赞两国人民的持久和牢固的友谊，
    干杯！
