Persist in Persuasion and Education, Convince with Reason

	Warrior Fei Houqing

Using the method of persuasion and education to resolve contradictions within the people is a consistent policy of our great leader Chairman Mao. In his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out: "All contradictions among the people should be resolved through democratic methods, through discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not through coercion or suppression."

Regarding contradictions among the people, whether to persuade or suppress is not merely a matter of method but a fundamental attitude, a question of whether or not to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions.

I once worked in a warehouse to support the left. I had a talk with a revolutionary rebel worker who had made mistakes in the struggle. After several talks, I became a bit impatient. Why? I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "In dealing with ideological problems among the people, with problems in the spiritual realm, it is not only ineffective but also very harmful to use simple methods." He also said: "To resolve contradictions among the people, one cannot use curses, nor can one use fists, and even less can one use guns." The reason is this: the Buddha one sets up must be the one one knocks down; the old ideas in one's head must be cleared out by oneself. Others can only explain the principles to him, raise his consciousness, and let him gradually realize the harm of old ideas and take the initiative to overthrow them. To try to drive away old ideas from someone's head with curses, fists, or guns will only make the old ideas persist and things will get worse. Later, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions, corrected my attitude, and had several more in-depth talks with that comrade. We studied Chairman Mao's works together and reminisced about hardships and sweetness. He quickly became enlightened and excitedly expressed to me that he would definitely follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution. The process of helping this comrade become enlightened made me further realize: Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on using persuasion to resolve contradictions among the people are universal truths.

A good knife is sharp only when the steel is used on the blade, and a key opens a lock only when it is inserted into the keyhole. When we help others, we must speak to their hearts to be effective. Therefore, we must understand the other person's active thoughts and have targeted conversations. At the same time, we must recognize that resolving contradictions takes time. Clearing out decades of old ideas from one's head cannot be achieved through one or two conversations. As long as we use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, with wholehearted enthusiasm and patience, any complex contradictions among the people can be resolved.

    坚持说服教育，以理服人	战士　费厚清
    用说服教育的方法解决人民内部矛盾，是我们伟大领袖毛主席一贯的方针。毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作中指出：“凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”对于人民内部的争论问题，是说服还是压服，绝不单纯是方法问题，而是根本态度问题，是执行不执行毛主席的指示的问题。
    我在某仓库支左，曾经找一个在斗争中犯了错误的革命造反派工人谈心。谈了几次不见效，我就有点冒火了。什么道理呢？我带着这个问题学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导。毛主席说：“对待人民内部的思想问题，对待精神世界的问题，用简单的方法去处理，不但不会收效，而且非常有害。”又说：“解决人民内部矛盾，不能用咒骂，也不能用拳头，更不能用刀枪”。原因就在于：自己立的菩萨要靠自己打倒，自己头脑里的旧思想要靠自己清除。别人只能给他讲道理，提高他的觉悟，让他逐步认识到旧思想的危害，自己起来革旧思想的命。想用咒骂、拳头、刀枪赶跑别人头脑里的旧思想，旧思想永远去不掉，相反，事情会越弄越糟。后来，我遵照毛主席的指示，端正了态度，又多次找那位工人同志深谈，和他一起学习毛主席著作，一起忆苦思甜。他很快觉悟了，激动地向我表示，今后一定紧跟毛主席干革命。帮助这位工人觉悟的过程，使我进一步体会到：毛主席关于运用说服的方法解决人民内部矛盾的光辉思想，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
    好钢用在刀刃上刀才快，钥匙投进锁簧里锁才开。我们帮助别人，也要把话说到人家的心坎上才能有效力。因此，必须了解对方的活思想，有的放矢地进行谈心。同时，还必须认识到矛盾转化要有个过程，清除头脑里几十年来形成的旧思想，不能设想通过一两次谈话就能成功。我们只要以毛泽东思想为武器，满腔热情，耐心细致，任何复杂的人民内部矛盾都不难解决。
