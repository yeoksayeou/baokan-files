	All issues of an ideological nature, all issues of controversy within the people, can only be resolved through democratic methods. They can only be resolved through methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved through coercive and subjugating methods.

    毛主席语录
    凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。
                    《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》
