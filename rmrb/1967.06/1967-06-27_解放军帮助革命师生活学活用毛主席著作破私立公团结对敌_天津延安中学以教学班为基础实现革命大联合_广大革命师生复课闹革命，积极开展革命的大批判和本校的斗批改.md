The Tianjin Yanan Middle School, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has resumed classes and made revolution, achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes, with the leftists as the core. The school has actively carried out revolutionary criticism and the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

The school has 1,300 students and teachers, with nearly 500 of them forming 48 combat organizations. These organizations have fought against the capitalist roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, achieving significant results. However, these organizations were often cross-class and cross-grade, with the largest having over 100 people and the smallest only 3-5. Some organizations had unclear fighting directions and once followed the bourgeois reactionary line without realizing it. The leaders of various revolutionary organizations had non-proletarian thoughts such as "only I am revolutionary" and "mountainheadism," arguing over non-principal issues. There were also divisions between teachers and students, and among teachers. All these issues seriously hindered revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," obstructing the unified struggle, criticism, and reform.

With the two-line struggle as the key, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to lay a solid ideological foundation for achieving revolutionary unity.

In February, the PLA unit stationed in Tianjin, following Chairman Mao's instructions, came to Yanan Middle School. After thorough investigation and research, they believed that to solve the problem of revolutionary unity, the two-line struggle must be the key, with a focus on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, starting from enhancing the teachers' and students' class struggle consciousness. On one hand, they firmly supported the revolutionary faction, and on the other, they worked with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, using the two-line struggle as the key, studying Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind. Through studying "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," everyone understood the importance of identifying enemies and friends, greatly raising their class consciousness and strengthening their class struggle awareness, laying a solid ideological foundation for unity against the enemy.

Next, the entire school, from classes to combat organizations, from students to teachers, held large and small meetings to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, directly targeting the capitalist roaders within the Party. This helped the broad teachers and students recognize the ugly faces of those who formulated and promoted the bourgeois reactionary line. Some who were misled by the bourgeois reactionary line quickly awakened, recognized their mistakes, and decided to break with the bourgeois reactionary line and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A previously conservative organization, after exposing the bourgeois reactionary line, had its core members publicly and deeply examine themselves. Many revolutionary organizations that previously saw this organization as the main target of criticism changed their views and attitudes. They said: We should direct our hatred towards the capitalist roaders within the Party; towards this organization, we should see both their execution of the bourgeois reactionary line and their status as victims of it. Our contradictions with them are internal contradictions among the people. Therefore, we must use the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to help and unite them, fighting the enemy together. Some revolutionary organizations that previously argued over trivial issues quickly strengthened their unity after clarifying the enemy and further clarifying the direction of the struggle. They actively examined themselves, saying: Arguing over trivial issues only weakens the revolutionary forces' combat effectiveness, causing pain to friends and joy to enemies. Some opposing organizations jointly held "unity meetings," deciding to fight the enemy together. Everyone excitedly said: "It is Mao Zedong Thought that has united us!"

Strongly support the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary leftists, help revolutionary organizations break down selfishness and establish public spirit, achieve revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core based on teaching classes.

Everyone had the requirement to achieve revolutionary unity and resume classes to make revolution, but what organizational form should be adopted?

Initially, some mass organizations proposed achieving revolutionary unity based on combat organizations. This raised the question of "who should be the core." Some organizations thought, "We have more people and greater strength, all organizations should rally around us"; others thought, "In terms of seniority, we are older, and in terms of contributions, we are greater, revolutionary unity should be based on us"; still, others thought, "Revolution does not distinguish between early and late, we have the correct direction and are latecomers, we can develop and grow, revolutionary unity should be based on us," and so on. They argued for more than 20 days without results. The broad revolutionary teachers and students were very anxious, thinking: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolutionaries," but now, with three people in a group and five in a clique, classes are based on classes, and combat organizations are cross-class, how can this work?

In this situation, students from Class 9 of Grade 2 posted a big-character poster, proposing to achieve revolutionary unity based on teaching classes. This poster sparked a heated response throughout the school. Some teachers and students participating in revolutionary organizations said: "This unity is beneficial for both revolution and teaching, completely meeting the needs of resuming classes to make revolution."

Some teachers and students who did not participate in organizations also reflected: "Now we have a place to go." They rushed back to their teaching classes to promote revolutionary unity. However, a small number of people still clung to their original small organizations, saying that achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes was a "compromise," a "mishmash," and "disbanding the combat organizations' stage." They had various active thoughts, some fearing loss of "territory" and not being able to lead after returning to class; some unwilling to leave due to friendships formed during the struggle; some fearing cold treatment upon return; and some not fully understanding the new situation of the Cultural Revolution entering the stage of unity and seizure of power and the significance of revolutionary unity based on teaching classes.

The PLA gave full support to this new thing of achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes. They organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "everything for the victory of the front line, organizational tasks must serve political tasks" and "the Communist Party within the Fourth Red Army exists various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line," and related commentaries. Thus, a new great debate unfolded in various classes and combat organizations.

During the debate, everyone used Chairman Mao's teachings as the basis, fiercely breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, prioritizing revolutionary interests. Through the PLA and revolutionary students actively doing political and ideological work in various classes, everyone realized that revolutionary unity is an inevitable trend of the revolutionary situation's development, not a mishmash or dismantling, but consolidating the position of the Cultural Revolution. Everyone agreed that the proletarian revolutionary faction should first achieve revolutionary unity, then with the leftists as the core, unite all possible forces. Various revolutionary organizations, based on ideological unity, held a rally to march towards revolutionary unity, happily returning to class to make revolution. The long-disbanded Yanan Middle School presented a new situation of revolutionary unity based on teaching classes, with the leftists as the core, resuming classes to make revolution.

Students returned to their classes, on one hand resuming classes to make revolution, on the other hand, starting to organize and develop the Red Guards, uniting all possible revolutionary forces. The Red Guards, in discussing and absorbing new members, followed the spirit of the Central Committee's policy, paying attention to both class background and not solely to class background, focusing on political performance. The Red Guards, with laboring people's children as the main body, also absorbed a part of non-laboring people's children who have deep feelings for Chairman Mao, have proletarian revolutionary spirit, and have always shown good political and ideological performance.

Unite the majority of teachers, establish a new type of teacher-student relationship.

This school has 69 teachers. After the Cultural Revolution began, the work team implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, proposing reactionary slogans such as "shell the immediate superior—the class teacher," directing the struggle target at the broad teachers, causing divisions between teachers and students. Many teachers were unwilling to approach students, and some students were unwilling to approach teachers.

How to remove the ideological barriers between teachers and students? The PLA comrades believed that the most important thing was to use Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, do a good job for both teachers and students, remove mutual misunderstandings, and achieve ideological unity. For teachers, they further exposed and criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, especially exposing and criticizing the part of the bourgeois reactionary line in the cadre issue of "striking a large piece, protecting a small piece," making teachers realize that they must attribute the account of "striking a large piece, protecting a small piece" to those who proposed this reactionary line and the capitalist roaders within the Party, not to the revolutionary little generals. Additionally, they organized teachers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "you must have politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution better," inspiring teachers to correct their attitudes towards mass movements. Many teachers said, we should abandon selfish thoughts, bravely stand out, unite with the revolutionary little generals, fight together, and win together. They removed their antagonistic emotions towards students and actively participated in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

For students, the PLA comrades organized them to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletariat only liberating all humanity to finally liberate itself, and the commentary in the fourth issue of the Red Flag magazine. Students understood the importance of uniting the majority in revolutionary struggles, expressing their determination to firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, welcome teachers to come out and revolutionize, help teachers to come out and revolutionize. For those who made mistakes and had ideological concerns, students visited them multiple times, enthusiastically encouraging and helping them return to class to make revolution together. After teachers returned to class, some classes even specially organized heart-to-heart talks, exposing their thoughts together, increasing understanding, and strengthening unity.

Due to both teachers and students actively examining their shortcomings, helping each other, removing ideological differences, a new type of teacher-student relationship based on Mao Zedong Thought began to form in Yanan Middle School. Now, teachers and students are both teachers and students and comrades, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, helping each other, making revolution together, studying Chairman Mao's works together, exposing their thoughts and fighting selfishness together, and participating in military training. Now, all teachers in the school have returned to their teaching classes, and many revolutionary teachers have participated in the revolutionary unity.

Revolutionary unity promotes revolutionary criticism, and revolutionary criticism consolidates revolutionary unity.

After achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes, Yanan Middle School fully demonstrated its strong combat effectiveness. Whether in eliminating the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line or in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform, the firepower was concentrated, the struggle was effective, and the results were significant.

As soon as Comrade Peng Zhen's article "Patriotism or Treason?" was published, all revolutionary teachers and students in the school, under the unified leadership of the school's Cultural Revolution Committee, launched a total attack on the biggest capitalist roader within the Party. They immediately held various meetings to deploy the battle, wrote big-character posters, wrote slogans, published wall newspapers specializing in criticism, criticized "Cultivation," and criticized the bourgeois reactionary line in the cadre issue. Now, they are combining the current struggle situation, seriously studying the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, determined to further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, further understand and grasp Mao Zedong's theory, line, policy, and principle of the proletarian Cultural Revolution, determined to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, combine the revolutionary criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and complete the struggle, criticism, and reform task of the unit.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of Yanan Middle School deeply felt the great significance of achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes from this unprecedentedly concentrated and powerful revolutionary criticism. They said, revolutionary unity is beneficial for revolutionary criticism, and revolutionary criticism, in turn, fundamentally consolidates and develops revolutionary unity. Only by achieving revolutionary unity can our proletarian Cultural Revolution achieve thorough victory.

    天津延安中学以教学班为基础实现革命大联合
    广大革命师生复课闹革命，积极开展革命的大批判和本校的斗批改
    本报讯　天津市延安中学，在人民解放军帮助下，复课闹革命，实现了以左派为核心、以教学班为基础的革命大联合，积极开展了革命的大批判和本校的斗批改。
    延安中学是一个有一千三百多名师生的初级中学，有近五百名师生先后成立了四十八个战斗组织。它们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行了针锋相对的斗争，取得不少成绩。但是，它们多是跨班、跨级的组织，人数最多的有一百多人，少的只有三五人。有的组织斗争方向不明确，一度执行了资产阶级反动路线，而又认识不清。各革命组织的领导人，有的有“唯我革命”、“山头主义”等非无产阶级思想，在一些非原则问题上争执不休。师生之间，教师之间，也有隔阂。所有这些，都严重地障碍着革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，障碍着统一地进行斗、批、改。
  以两条路线斗争为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，为实现革命大联合打下牢固的思想基础
    今年二月，人民解放军驻天津某部遵照毛主席的指示来到延安中学。他们经过周密的调查研究，认为要解决革命的大联合的问题，必须以两条路线斗争为纲，大抓活学活用毛主席著作，从增强师生阶级斗争的观念入手。他们一方面坚决支持革命派，一方面和广大革命师生一道，以两条路线斗争为纲，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。大家经过学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》，懂得了“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的道理，大大提高了阶级觉悟，增强了阶级斗争观念，从思想上打下了团结对敌的基础。
    然后，全校从班级到战斗组织，从学生到教师，通过大会、小会对资产阶级反动路线展开了控诉、揭发和批判，矛头直指党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使广大师生认清了制定和推行资产阶级反动路线的一小撮人的丑恶面目。一些受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，也在解放军和革命派的帮助下很快觉悟起来，认识了自己的错误，决心跟资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。一个过去保守思想比较严重的群众组织，在控诉了资产阶级反动路线以后，领导核心成员向群众进行公开的深刻的检查。许多革命组织过去把这个群众组织当成主要批判对象，现在也改变了对它的看法和态度。他们说：我们应当把仇恨集中在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上；对这个组织，既要看到他们执行了资产阶级反动路线，又要看到他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。我们和他们之间的矛盾是人民内部的矛盾。因此，我们一定要用“团结——批评——团结”的方法，帮助他们，团结他们，共同对敌。一些过去在枝节问题上争论不休的革命组织，在认清敌我，进一步明确斗争大方向以后，也很快加强了团结。他们主动检查说：我们在枝节问题上纠缠，只能削弱革命队伍的战斗力量，使亲者痛、仇者快。有些互相对立的组织联合召开了“团结会”，决心共同对敌。大家激动地说：“是毛泽东思想把我们团结起来了！”
    大力支持革命左派首创精神，帮助革命组织破私立公，以左派为核心按教学班实现革命大联合
    大家有了实现全校革命的大联合、复课闹革命的要求，但是，应该采取什么样的组织形式呢？
    开始，有的群众组织提出以战斗组织为基础，实现革命的大联合。这里就发生了一个“以谁为中心”的问题。有的组织认为，“我们的人马多，力量大，各组织都应该向我们靠拢”；有的组织认为，“论资格，我们老，论贡献，我们大，大联合应该以我们为核心”；有的组织认为，“革命不分先后，我们大方向正确，是后起之秀，可以发展壮大，大联合应以我为主”，等等。这样争论了二十多天，还是没有结果。广大革命师生心里非常焦急，他们想：毛主席教导我们“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”，可是，现在三人一群，五人一伙，上课是按班级，搞运动是跨班级的战斗组，心挂两头这怎么能成？
    就在这种情况下，二年级九班的同学贴出了一张大字报，主张以教学班为基础，实现全校革命的大联合。这张大字报，在全校引起了热烈的反响。一些参加革命组织的师生表示：“这样联合，既利于革命，又利于教学，完全适合复课闹革命的需要。”
    有些没参加组织的革命师生也反映：“这下我们也有着落了。”他们纷纷杀回教学班，从事促进革命大联合的工作。但是，还有少部分人抱住原来的小组织不放，他们说，以教学班为基础的革命的大联合，是“折中主义”的做法，是“大杂烩”，是“拆战斗组织的台”。他们有各种不同的活思想，有的是怕回班之后失掉“地盘”，当不成“领导”；有的是在几个月的斗争中结下战斗的友谊不愿离开；有的怕回班受冷遇；还有的是对无产阶级文化大革命进入联合夺权阶段的新形势和以教学班为基础的革命大联合的意义认识不足。
    对于按教学班实现革命的大联合这一新生事物，解放军给予了满腔热情的支持。他们针对这些活思想，组织大家学习了毛主席关于“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务”、“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大”的教导和有关社论。于是，一场新的大辩论在各班、各战斗组开展起来。
    在辩论过程中，大家以毛主席的教导为依据，狠破私字，大立公字，以革命利益为重。经过解放军和革命同学主动到各班作政治思想工作，大家认识到革命的大联合是革命形势发展的必然趋势，不是大杂烩，不是拆台，而是巩固无产阶级文化大革命的阵地。大家纷纷同意无产阶级革命派首先实现革命的大联合，然后以左派为核心，团结一切可以团结的力量。各个革命组织在思想统一的基础上，召开了向革命的大联合进军的誓师大会，高高兴兴地回班闹革命。长期分散的延安中学，出现了一个以左派为核心，全校实现革命的大联合，复课闹革命的崭新局面。
    学生回到班里，一面复课闹革命，一面着手整顿和发展红卫兵组织，团结一切可以团结的革命力量。红卫兵组织在讨论、吸收新成员的时候，按照党中央政策精神，既重视阶级成分，又不唯成分论，注意其政治表现。红卫兵以劳动人民出身的学生为主体，也吸收了一部分对毛主席有深厚感情，有无产阶级革命精神，一贯在政治思想上表现较好的非劳动人民出身的学生参加。
    团结教师的大多数，建立新型的师生关系
    这个学校共有教师六十九名。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，工作队执行资产阶级反动路线，提出“炮轰顶头上司——班主任”等反动口号，把斗争目标指向广大教师，造成了师生间的隔阂。不少教师不愿意接近学生，有些学生也不愿意接近教师。
    怎样消除师生之间的思想障碍呢？解放军同志认为，最重要的问题是用毛泽东思想挂帅，做好师生两方面的工作，消除彼此之间的误会，达到思想上的团结。对教师，他们通过进一步揭发、批判资产阶级反动路线，特别是揭发、批判在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，使教师们认识到一定要把“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的账记在提出这条反动路线的几个人身上，记在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上，而不应记在革命小将身上。另外，他们还组织教师反复学习毛主席关于“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，启发教师端正自己对待群众运动的态度。许多教师说，我们应当抛弃私心杂念，勇敢地站出来，同革命小将团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。他们消除了与学生的对立情绪，积极参加了学校的斗批改。
    对于学生，解放军同志组织他们学习毛主席关于无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的教导，以及《红旗》杂志第四期社论。学生们懂得了在革命斗争中团结大多数的重要性，表示要坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，欢迎教师站出来革命，帮助教师站出来革命。对那些犯过错误，思想上有顾虑的教师，学生们几次登门拜访，热情地鼓励和帮助他们回到班上一起闹革命。在教师回班以后，有些班的学生还特地组织了谈心会，和教师一起亮思想，增进了解，加强团结。
    由于师生双方都主动检查自己的缺点，互相帮助，消除思想分歧，一种以毛泽东思想为基础的新型师生关系在延安中学开始建立起来。现在，师生之间既是师生，也是同志，互相取长补短，互相帮助，一起闹革命，一起学毛主席著作，一起亮思想、斗私心，一起参加军训。现在，全校教师都回到了教学班，并且有不少革命教师参加了革命的大联合。
  革命的大联合促进革命的大批判，革命的大批判巩固革命的大联合
    延安中学实现了按教学班的革命大联合以后，充分显示了它强大的战斗力。无论在肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒中，还是在本校的斗批改中，火力集中，斗争得力，成效显著。
    戚本禹同志的文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一发表，全校革命师生立即在校文化革命委员会的统一领导下，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击。他们连夜召开各种会议部署战斗，写大字报，写标语，出版批判的墙报专刊，批判《修养》，批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线。现在，他们正结合目前斗争的新形势，认真地学习中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，决心进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，决心紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把革命的大批判运动同本单位斗批改结合起来，掀起一个革命的大批判的新高潮，胜利完成本单位的斗批改任务。
    延安中学广大革命师生，从这次空前集中、空前有力的革命的大批判中，深刻地体会到以教学班为基础实现全校革命大联合的伟大意义。他们说，革命的大联合，有利于革命的大批判，而革命的大批判反过来又从根本上巩固和发展了革命的大联合。只有把革命的大联合搞好了，我们的无产阶级文化大革命才能取得彻底的胜利。
