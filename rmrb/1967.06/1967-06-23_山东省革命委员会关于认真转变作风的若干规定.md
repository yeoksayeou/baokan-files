The proletarian cultural revolution in our province is currently developing in depth in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. To carry this great revolutionary movement through to the end and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to prevent capitalist restoration, it is necessary in Shandong to establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. All our words and actions must take whether they conform to Mao Zedong Thought as the highest criterion. All members of the Revolutionary Committee must take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works and must make studying Chairman Mao's works a daily routine. We must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses" and "always maintaining a humble, prudent, modest, and unassuming style of work, always maintaining a style of hard struggle," and frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism. In ideology, work style, and life, we must all achieve revolutionization, always appear in the guise of ordinary laborers, resolutely oppose special privileges, and resolutely oppose all styles of work that are detached from the masses. To this end, the following specific regulations are made:

	(1) It is forbidden to sing praises of the members of the Revolutionary Committee, to post big-character posters or big-character slogans flattering the members of the Revolutionary Committee. Those that have already been posted must be persuaded by the masses to be quickly covered up.

	(2) Without collective discussion, members of the Revolutionary Committee may not arbitrarily represent the Revolutionary Committee to speak everywhere. Their speeches, without the approval of the Revolutionary Committee, may not be recorded or printed.

	(3) For meetings attended by members of the Revolutionary Committee, there should be no welcoming or sending off, no applause, and no photography or filming without the approval of the Revolutionary Committee.

	(4) Members of the Revolutionary Committee must spend a certain amount of time engaging in physical labor.

	(5) Members of the Revolutionary Committee may not give or accept gifts in their personal names.

	(6) The names of members of the Revolutionary Committee should generally not be published in newspapers. When it is necessary to publish them, it should be done in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee.

	(7) Members of the Revolutionary Committee must be frugal and not wasteful. They may not use public vehicles for personal matters, and when using vehicles for official business, they must pay attention to economy.

	(8) Members of the Revolutionary Committee must spend a certain amount of time personally receiving visitors from the masses and personally handling letters from the people.

	(9) Members of the Revolutionary Committee must frequently go among the masses, with the attitude of being willing to learn, hold investigation meetings and discussion meetings, and listen to opinions and criticisms.

	(10) The Revolutionary Committee should conduct a small rectification every so often (for example, every two months). According to the needs, each rectification should invite a certain number of representatives from mass organizations to participate.

    山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定
    目前，我省的无产阶级文化大革命，正在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中向纵深发展着。为了把这场伟大的革命运动进行到底，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，在山东必须树立毛主席的绝对权威，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们的一切言论和行动，都必须以是否符合毛泽东思想为最高准则。革命委员会的全体成员，必须带头学好毛主席著作，必须把学习毛主席著作列为每天必行的制度。必须反复学习毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”和“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大指示，经常开展批评和自我批评，在思想上、工作上、作风上、生活上都要实现革命化，处处以普通劳动者的姿态出现，坚决反对特殊化，坚决反对一切脱离群众的作风。为此，特作如下具体规定：
    （一）禁止给革命委员会的成员歌功颂德，禁止贴恭维革命委员会成员的大字报和大字标语。已经贴出的，要说服群众迅速覆盖。
    （二）未经集体讨论，革命委员会的成员不能随意代表革命委员会到处讲话。他们的讲话，未经革命委员会批准，不准录音，不准印讲话稿。
    （三）革命委员会成员出发或参加的各种群众集会，不要迎送，不要鼓掌，未经革命委员会批准，不准照相、拍电影片。
    （四）革命委员会的成员要拿出一定时间参加体力劳动。
    （五）革命委员会的成员，不得以个人名义赠送礼物，也不得接受别人的礼物。
    （六）革命委员会成员的名字，一般不要登报。必须见报时，要遵照中央规定办理。
    （七）革命委员会的成员，要艰苦朴素，不准铺张浪费。因私事不准乘坐公家汽车，因公乘坐汽车也要注意节约。
    （八）革命委员会的成员，要拿出一定时间，亲自接待群众来访，亲自处理人民来信。
    （九）革命委员会的成员，要经常到群众中去，以甘当小学生的态度，召开调查会、座谈会，听取意见和批评。
    （十）革命委员会每过一段时间（例如两个月），进行一次小整风。根据需要，每次整风都要吸收一定数量的群众组织的代表参加。
