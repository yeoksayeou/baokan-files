The revolutionary modern Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "On the Docks," "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," as well as the revolutionary ballets "Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," and the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang," have finally broken through numerous obstacles and emerged, taking the stage of proletarian revolutionary arts. These brilliant gems, radiant with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, have made all the cultural and artistic works of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism pale in comparison the moment they appeared on stage.

The birth of these revolutionary model operas is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the proletarian cultural revolution, and at the same time, a great practice of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

Just as the birth of the revolutionary modern Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Red Lantern," and "Shajiabang" has restored the vitality of traditional Chinese dramatic arts, the birth of the revolutionary ballets "Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" has also revived the dying foreign traditional ballet. They have completely buried the old relics like "Swan Lake," "Romeo and Juliet," and "Giselle," which were once hailed as the pinnacle of world ballet art and exuded the stench of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes. From thought content to artistic form, they are completely renewed and have become the ballets that our workers, peasants, and soldiers need. This is a great development and innovation in proletarian revolutionary arts.

However, the Soviet revisionist traitors attack and slander us, saying that the cultural revolution has "suffocated traditional Chinese drama and its interesting dramatic elements and exquisite performance skills," and that it has "absolutely rejected the cultural heritage of the predecessors." While maliciously attacking us, the Soviet revisionist traitors portray themselves as the "inheritors" of the traditional drama and art forms and cultural heritage of the Soviet people, which is both laughable and pathetic!

The Soviet revisionist traitors' slander against us is not worth refuting. Inheritance has class characteristics. We proletarians inherit the cultural heritage created by the people of all nations and all ages, removing the dross and taking the essence. As for your so-called respect for cultural heritage, it is merely respect for the "cultural heritage" of the Western bourgeoisie. On your stage, the laboring people who create history are trampled beyond recognition, while the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties strut about like masters.

Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "All culture or literature and art belongs to a certain class and a certain political line." Chairman Mao also teaches us: The overthrown bourgeoisie uses various methods to try to use the literary and artistic front as a breeding ground to corrupt the masses and prepare for the restoration of capitalism. Today, under the rule of revisionism in the Soviet Union, the literary and artistic field, like the political and economic fields, is completely serving the political line of the bourgeoisie and the restoration of capitalism. The reason you desperately summon the ghosts of the 18th and 19th centuries is to use their feudal and bourgeois decaying content, as well as their bizarre and unrealistic forms, to corrupt the masses and create a breeding ground for the full restoration of capitalism.

It is clear that for you, it is not a matter of "inheriting cultural heritage," but a matter of great retrogression. You are completely leaning towards the West, towards capitalism.

In order to realize the counter-revolutionary restoration plot, you have also opened the door wide for the decadent and reactionary "Western culture." The rotten and decadent things from American and Western culture, you pick them up as treasures and even "develop" and "create" them.

Isn't this the case?

You are eager to act as the missionaries of Western and American decadent culture. The American and Western dances like the hoodlum dance, swing dance, and modern dance, which are full of pathological and obscene movements, are widely spread in the Soviet Union. Even the famous Bolshoi Theatre, when it visited the United States in April 1962, shamelessly performed a "striptease." This "shocking" performance immediately won the applause of American public opinion and the Wall Street bosses.

Under the influence of the craze for learning "Western culture," the traditional folk dances of the Soviet Union with a long history have been strangled. An article in the Soviet "Labor" newspaper in September 1965 admitted, "Swing dance has actually spread widely. It is not only in foreign films, but also on some Soviet film screens.... As for the new Soviet dances in the films, you can't even find a 20-second clip. What appears on the stage is still swing dance."

Who is suffocating the traditional performance skills? Isn't it clear that it is you, the Soviet revisionists, who use Western "performance skills" to suffocate the traditional performance skills of the Soviet people?

The question of for whom art serves is a fundamental and principled question. Proletarian revolutionary art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the proletarian dictatorship. Great Lenin said: "It is not for the well-fed ladies who have nothing to do, not for the bored and fat 'tens of thousands of upper-class people,' but for the millions and millions of laboring people, for the backbone, the strength, and the future of these countries." While the art of the Soviet revisionists serves a small handful of the exploiting classes and serves the policy of "peaceful evolution" of imperialism.

The Soviet revisionist traitors, who have done all kinds of conspiracies, when the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution tore off their fig leaves and exposed their fox tails, tried to cover up their decay by attacking and slandering the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

Mad dogs barking at the sun do not dim its brilliance. No matter how the Soviet revisionist traitors attack and slander, it does not diminish the great power of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution in the slightest. Our proletarian cultural revolution is proving to the world with iron-clad facts that the proletariat is not only good at destroying an old world but will also be good at creating a new world. We destroy the old culture precisely to create a new culture. Only the proletariat values the cultural treasures of mankind. On the basis of critically inheriting cultural heritage, we will carry forward the essence of the national culture created by the people of all nations and all ages, and create a new culture that is more brilliant and magnificent than any previous era!

    狂犬吠日，无损太阳的光辉

    革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》等革命样板戏，终于冲破了重重障碍杀出来了，登上了无产阶级革命文艺的舞台。这些焕发着毛泽东思想光辉的光彩夺目的艺术明珠，一登上舞台，就使全世界所有的封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的文化艺术黯然失色。
    这些革命样板戏的诞生，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，同时，也是毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一光辉著作的伟大实践。
    正如《智取威虎山》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》等革命现代京剧的诞生，使传统的中国戏剧艺术恢复了青春一样，《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》等革命芭蕾舞剧的诞生，也使濒于死亡的外国传统芭蕾舞获得新生。它们把被吹捧为世界芭蕾舞艺术“顶峰”的《天鹅湖》、
  《罗密欧与朱丽叶》、《吉赛尔》等等散发着资产阶级和封建阶级霉臭味的老古董彻底埋葬了，无论从思想内容到艺术形式都是焕然一新，成为我们工农兵所需要的芭蕾舞剧。这是无产阶级革命文艺的大发展，新创造。
    然而，苏修叛徒们却攻击污蔑我们什么文化革命“窒息了传统的中国戏剧及其有趣的戏剧性和精湛的表演技巧”啦，什么“断然拒绝前辈的文化遗产”啦。苏修叛徒们在恶毒攻击我们的同时，俨然把自己打扮成苏联人民传统的戏剧和艺术形式及文化遗产的“继承”者，真是可笑亦复可悲！
    苏修叛徒们对我们的无耻污蔑，是经不起一驳的。继承是有阶级性的。我们无产阶级继承的，是中外历代人民创造的民族文化的遗产，剔除其糟粕，吸取其精华。而你们修正主义所谓的尊重文化遗产，也就是尊重西方资产阶级的“文化遗产”而已。在你们的舞台上，创造历史的劳动人民被糟塌得不成样子，而那些帝王将相、才子佳人却象主人翁一样自由地走来走去。
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席早就指出：“一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”毛主席又教导我们：被推翻了的资产阶级采用各种方法，企图利用文艺阵地，作为腐蚀群众、准备资本主义复辟的温床。今天，在修正主义统治下的苏联，文学艺术领域也正如政治经济等领域一样，完全是为着资产阶级、为着复辟资本主义的政治路线服务的。你们之所以要拚命地召唤出十八、十九世纪的幽灵来，无非想利用它们的封建的、资产阶级的腐朽内容，以及离奇古怪、脱离现实的形式来腐蚀群众，作为资本主义全面复辟的温床。
    很明显，对你们来说，根本不是什么
  “继承文化遗产”的问题，而是大倒退。你们是一边倒，倒向西方，倒向资本主义。
    为了实现反革命复辟的阴谋，你们还为腐朽反动的“西方文化”大开方便之门，美国和西方文化中糜烂透顶的东西，你们却捡来当作宝贝，甚至加以“发挥”和创造。
    事实不正是如此吗？
    你们竭力充当西方和美国腐朽文化的传道士。美国和西方的阿飞舞、摇摆舞和现代舞等掺杂着病态和猥亵动作的舞蹈，正在苏联广泛流传。甚至著名的莫斯科大剧院在一九六二年四月访问美国时，竟然无耻地跳起
  “脱衣舞”来，这个“惊人”的演出，马上博得了美国舆论及华尔街老板的喝采。
    在学习“西方文化”热潮的影响下，使苏联具有悠久文化传统的民间舞蹈受到了扼杀。一九六五年九月苏联《劳动报》的一篇文章承认，“摇摆舞实际上广泛地传播开了。不只是在外国电影中，而是在一些苏联电影的银幕上。……至于苏联新舞蹈在影片中，你连二十秒钟的片子都找不到。出现在舞台上的也还是摇摆舞”。
    究竟是谁在窒息传统的表演技巧，这不是明明白白的吗？正是你们苏联修正主义用西方的“表演技巧”，窒息了苏联人民传统的表演技巧。
    文艺为谁服务的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。无产阶级革命文艺，必须为工农兵服务，为无产阶级专政服务。伟大列宁说过：“它不是为饱食终日的贵妇人服务，不是为百无聊赖、胖得发愁的‘几万上等人’服务，而是为千千万万劳动人民，为这些国家的精华、国家的力量、国家的未来服务。”而苏修的文艺，却是为一小撮剥削阶级服务，为帝国主义推行“和平演变”的政策服务。
    干尽阴谋勾当的苏修叛徒们，当中国无产阶级文化大革命揭去了它们的遮羞布，使狐狸尾巴毕露的时候，就想以攻击和污蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命来掩盖自己的腐朽。
    狂犬吠日，无损于太阳的光辉。不管苏修叛徒们怎样攻击和污蔑，也丝毫无损于中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大威力。我们的无产阶级文化大革命，正以铁的事实向全世界证明这样一个真理：无产阶级不但善于破坏一个旧世界，而且将善于创造一个新世界。我们消灭旧文化，正是为了创造新文化。只有无产阶级最重视人类的文化财富，在批判地继承文化遗产的基础上，发扬中外历代人民创造的民族文化的精华，并将创造出为过去一切时代都望尘莫及的极其灿烂辉煌的新文化！
