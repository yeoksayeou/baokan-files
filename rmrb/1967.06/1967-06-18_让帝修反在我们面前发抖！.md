The east wind is roaring, and good news is pouring in. Just as our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering its decisive stage, another piece of heartening news has arrived—the successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, another rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb has greatly inspired our country's revolutionary masses of the proletariat and has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the whole world. We, the entire membership of the Dongfanghong Commune of Beijing Geological Institute, enthusiastically hail this great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The U.S. imperialists and the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union are colluding with each other, attempting to monopolize nuclear weapons and engage in nuclear blackmail. The successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb has once again foiled their plot. The successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb is a great blow to the U.S. imperialists and the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union. It is a great encouragement and support to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. aggression for national salvation, to the Arab countries that are bravely counterattacking the U.S.-Israeli aggression, and to the revolutionary people of the whole world.

Our country has developed the hydrogen bomb in the shortest possible time, which eloquently proves that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has boundless power. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have, after one year of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ability to create any miracle and to dare to scale any peak or overcome any obstacle.

The U.S. imperialists, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries have joined forces to frantically oppose China, viciously attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought. They are doomed to complete failure. Now that our first hydrogen bomb has successfully exploded, let the imperialists, revisionists, reactionaries, and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party tremble before our victory!

We most enthusiastically hail the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!

    让帝修反在我们面前发抖！
    北京市革命委员会常委

    东风浩荡，捷报纷传。正当我国无产阶级文化大革命进入决战阶段，又传来了一个振奋人心的好消息——我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了。这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。我国第一颗氢弹的爆炸成功，极大地鼓舞了我国的无产阶级革命派，大长了全世界革命人民的志气。我们北京地质学院东方红公社全体战士最热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的这一伟大胜利。
    美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义相互勾结，妄图实行核垄断，进行核讹诈。我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，再次使他们的阴谋破产了。我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，是对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义的一个巨大打击，是对正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民，正在英勇反击美以侵略的阿拉伯各国人民，以及全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞和支持。
    我国在最短的时间内就搞出了氢弹，雄辩地证明战无不胜的毛泽东思想具有不可估量的威力。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，经过一年来的无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，什么人间奇迹都能创造，什么样的高峰险阻都敢攀登。
    美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派联合起来疯狂地反华，恶毒地攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命，极力反对毛泽东思想。他们是注定要完全失败的。现在我们的第一颗氢弹成功的爆炸了，让帝、修、反和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在我们的胜利面前发抖吧！
    我们最最热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！
