New York, June 29 (Xinhua) — On June 26, Albanian Foreign Minister Nesti Nasë addressed the United Nations General Assembly emergency session, sternly condemning the armed aggression by U.S. and British imperialism and their tool, Israel, against Arab countries. He vehemently denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying the interests of the world's people and colluding with U.S. imperialism to plot a new counter-revolutionary global conspiracy.

Nasë pointed out, "The recent heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, against Arab countries and peoples are new and unprecedented." He said, "The treacherous attack by Israel on Arab countries on June 5 is the result of imperialism's, primarily U.S. imperialism's, war and aggression policy of plunder, aiming to realize its vicious neocolonialist plans and schemes in the Middle East, a region of great political, economic, and strategic significance. This act of banditry is part of the U.S.'s evil plan to re-enslave the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and suppress the unstoppable revolutionary fervor sweeping across these continents."

Nasë said, "From the day of its establishment, Israel has received financial support from the United States and other imperialist countries and has been armed to the teeth. It has always been a submissive tool of imperialism in implementing its neocolonialist plans to enslave the peoples of Arab countries. Without the continuous aid and support from imperialist countries, Israel would never dare to embark on such a criminal adventure."

The Albanian Foreign Minister emphasized, "The United States not only instigated and plotted the sudden attack on Arab countries but also directly participated in the attack and did everything possible to create the most favorable conditions for it." He said, "Undisputed facts show that from the outset of the war, U.S. and British imperialists directly participated in Israel's aggression against Arab countries and peoples, deploying aircraft to bomb Arab countries' bases and military forces." He pointed out that the United States also put the Sixth Fleet on a war footing, allowing it to join British Mediterranean and Red Sea fleets in displaying force along the coasts of Arab countries, threatening Arab countries.

In his speech, Nasë exposed the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist clique in betraying the interests of the Arab people. He pointed out that the aggressors, the United States, Britain, and Israel, "received support from the Brezhnev-Kosygin government both in the preparation for the aggression, during the aggression, and after the aggression." He said, "The hypocritical attitude of the Kosygin government exposed its betrayal of the interests of the Arab people. Various facts prove that at the most critical moment, they abandoned the Arab countries and left the Arab countries in dire straits." He pointed out that after the aggression, the Kosygin government not only provided no assistance to the Arab countries but rushed to collude with U.S. imperialists, pushing the United Nations Security Council to pass the infamous "ceasefire" resolution. He said that in this resolution, there was not a word about Israel being the aggressor, and it did not uphold the legitimate rights of the Arab countries in the slightest. He pointed out, "These resolutions in fact legitimized the imperialist-Zionist aggression, encouraged the aggressors, and were like a stab in the back of the Arab countries." Nasë emphasized, "The Kosygin government's double-dealing aims to assist U.S. imperialism and bring the Middle East issue into the track of Soviet-U.S. bargaining."

Nasë said, "The savage aggression by the United States, Britain, and Israel against Arab countries shows that U.S. imperialism is the greatest and most dangerous enemy of the peoples of all countries." He said, "The Middle East incident and the U.S. aggression against Vietnam are two important links in the same chain. The attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union on the Middle East and Vietnam issues show that 'the world today faces a great conspiracy planned by the U.S. imperialist and Soviet revisionist leaders, which conforms to the policy of the two countries dividing spheres of influence and jointly ruling the world.'"

The Albanian Foreign Minister strongly condemned the recent counter-revolutionary global conspiracy between Kosygin and Johnson. He pointed out that the peoples of all peace-loving countries in the world are extremely indignant and strongly condemn the Johnson-Kosygin talks because they know, and are more convinced than ever, that the United States and the Soviet Union "will not come up with anything else, but will plot a new imperialist-revisionist conspiracy that is more extensive, more dangerous to international peace and security, and directed against the peoples of all countries."

Nasë pointed out that the so-called "aid" provided by the Soviet revisionist clique to the peoples of the Mediterranean countries is a big fraud. The so-called "friendship" of the Soviet revisionists is a stab in the back. Albania has long experienced this "friendship," and now the Arab peoples have also experienced it.

Nasë stressed that the recent Israeli aggression against Arab countries should serve as a lesson for the Arab countries and all freedom-loving countries and peoples. They must mobilize, strengthen their fighting forces, and form an unbreakable unity. They should resolutely fight against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism, with all means to defeat this common enemy of the peoples of the world.

Nasë reiterated at the meeting that the Albanian people support the just struggle of the Arab peoples. He said, "They have stood with the Arab peoples in the past and will always stand with them in the future, firmly believing that the just cause of the Arab peoples will surely triumph."

Nasë finally proposed a resolution for the Assembly to adopt. The resolution called for: (1) Strongly condemning the armed aggression by the Israeli government against the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan; (2) Strongly condemning the U.S. and British governments for instigating, supporting, and directly participating in this aggression; (3) Strongly demanding that Israeli troops immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the occupied territories of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan; (4) Requiring the Israeli government to fully and immediately compensate for the losses caused by its aggression against the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan; (5) Affirming that only the United Arab Republic government has the right to decide whether to allow Israeli aggressor ships to pass through the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran.

    阿外长在联合国痛斥约翰逊柯西金进行反革命全球性大勾结
    美帝苏修正策划奴役全世界的大阴谋
    苏修的所谓“友谊”就是从背后给人一刀
    新华社二十九日讯　纽约消息：阿尔巴尼亚外交部长奈斯蒂·纳赛二十六日在联合国大会紧急会议上发言，严正谴责美、英帝国主义及其工具以色列对阿拉伯国家发动的武装侵略，严辞痛斥苏联修正主义领导集团叛卖世界人民的利益，勾结美帝共同策划反革命的全球性勾结的新阴谋。
    纳赛指出，“美帝国主义及其工具以色列最近对阿拉伯国家和人民犯了新的滔天罪行。”他说，六月五日以色列对阿拉伯国家的阴险袭击，“是帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义的战争和侵略掠夺政策的结果，目的是企图在具有重大政治、经济和战略意义的中东地区实现其穷凶极恶的新殖民主义计划和阴谋。这一强盗行径，是美国妄图重新奴役亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民，压制这些大陆上到处掀起的势不可挡的人民革命怒潮的罪恶计划的组成部分”。
    纳赛说，“以色列从它成立的第一天起，就得到美国和其他帝国主义国家的财政支援，并且被武装到牙齿。它始终是被帝国主义用来实现奴役阿拉伯各国人民的新殖民主义计划的俯首贴耳的工具。如果没有帝国主义国家不断的援助和支持，以色列显然是决不敢进行这种罪恶冒险的。”
    阿尔巴尼亚外长强调指出，“美国不仅煽动和策划了对阿拉伯国家的突然袭击，而且直接参与了这次袭击，并竭尽全力为这次袭击创造尽可能有利的条件。”他说，“无可争议的事实说明，美英帝国主义者从战争一开始就直接参与了以色列对阿拉伯国家和人民的侵略，出动了飞机轰炸阿拉伯国家的基地和军队。”他指出，美国还把第六舰队置于战争状态，让它伙同英国的地中海舰队和红海舰队在阿拉伯国家沿海显示武力，对阿拉伯国家进行威胁。
    纳赛在发言中揭露了苏联修正主义集团叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的卑鄙行径。他指出，美国、英国和以色列侵略者“不论在侵略的准备时期，在侵略过程中，还是在侵略之后，都得到勃列日涅夫—柯西金政府的支援”。他说，“柯西金政府的伪善态度暴露了它背叛阿拉伯人民利益的嘴脸。种种事实证明，在最紧要的关头，他们抛弃了阿拉伯国家，置面临困难的阿拉伯国家于不顾。”他指出，在侵略发生后，柯西金政府不仅没有给阿拉伯国家任何援助，反而急急忙忙同美帝国主义者串通一气，促使联合国安全理事会通过臭名远扬的“停火”决议。他说，在这个决议中只字不提以色列是侵略者，丝毫没有维护阿拉伯国家的正当权利。他指出，“这些决议事实上认可了帝国主义—犹太复国主义的侵略，是对侵略者的一种鼓励，等于在阿拉伯国家背上插了一刀。”纳赛强调说，“柯西金政府玩弄两面手法，目的在于给美帝国主义帮忙，把中东问题纳入苏美交易的轨道。”
    纳赛说，美国、英国和以色列“对阿拉伯国家的野蛮侵略表明，美帝国主义是各国人民最大和最危险的敌人”。他说，中东事件和美国对越南的侵略战争是同一个链条上的两个重要环节。美国和苏联在中东和越南问题上的态度表明，“全世界今天面临着美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义头目所策划的符合于美苏两国划分势力范围、共同主宰世界的政策的大阴谋。”
    阿尔巴尼亚外长强烈谴责柯西金和约翰逊最近在美国进行的反革命的全球性大勾结。他指出，全世界爱好和平的各国人民都感到万分愤怒，并强烈谴责约翰逊—柯西金会谈，因为他们知道，而且比过去更加确信，美苏两国“不会搞出别的名堂来，只会策划矛头指向各国人民、规模更大、对国际和平和安全更加危险的帝国主义—修正主义的新阴谋”。
    纳赛指出，苏联修正主义集团对地中海各国人民的所谓“援助”，是一个大骗局。苏修的所谓“友谊”，就是从背后给人一刀。阿尔巴尼亚早已领教过这种“友谊”，现在阿拉伯人民也领教了这种“友谊”。
    纳赛强调说，以色列最近对阿拉伯国家的侵略应当成为阿拉伯国家和一切爱好自由的国家和人民的教训。他们必须动员起来，加强他们的战斗队伍，形成牢不可破的团结，他们应当坚定地以一切方法与共同的敌人——美帝国主义进行坚决斗争，以打败这个全世界人民共同的敌人。
    纳赛在会上重申，阿尔巴尼亚人民支持阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争。他说，他们过去站在，今后也将永远站在阿拉伯人民一边，深信阿拉伯各国人民的正义事业必胜。
    纳赛最后提出一项提案，要求大会通过。这项提案主张：（一）坚决谴责以色列政府对阿联、叙利亚、约旦的武装侵略；（二）坚决谴责美国和英国政府唆使、支持以及直接参与这一侵略；（三）坚决要求以色列军队立即和无条件撤出被占领的阿联、叙利亚和约旦的领土；（四）要求以色列政府全部和立即赔偿它对阿联、叙利亚、约旦的侵略所造成的损失；（五）肯定只有阿联政府才有资格决定是否许可以色列侵略者的船只通过苏伊士运河和蒂朗海峡。
