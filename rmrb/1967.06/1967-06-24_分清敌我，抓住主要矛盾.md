Mastering the Direction of Struggle and Uniting the Majority of the Masses

—Excerpts from Speeches at a Study Session on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" by the Reconnaissance Platoon of a Certain Unit in the Nanjing Military Region

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the Reconnaissance Platoon of a certain unit in the Nanjing Military Region, an advanced unit in studying the works of Chairman Mao, held a study session to share their experiences in actively supporting the broad masses of the left during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by applying this brilliant work. The following are excerpts from the speeches given by some comrades at the study session.

Distinguishing Between Enemies and Ourselves, Grasping the Main Contradiction

Platoon Leader Chen Xuezheng

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To correctly recognize the two different kinds of contradictions—those between the enemy and us and those among the people—we must first distinguish who are our enemies and who are our friends." The issue of distinguishing between enemies and ourselves is the primary issue of the revolution, the issue of whether we can adhere to the correct direction of struggle, and the premise for correctly handling contradictions among the people.

What is the direction of the struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? It is to concentrate our forces to strike down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat. The contradictions between them and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are antagonistic contradictions, enemy-versus-ourselves contradictions, and the main contradictions that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to resolve. Only by distinguishing between enemies and ourselves and firmly grasping this main contradiction can we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and correctly treat revolutionary masses.

Not long ago, I went to a factory to carry out the task of supporting the left. At that time, the two revolutionary mass organizations in the factory were engaged in "internal warfare." After thorough investigation, it was found that their direction of struggle was originally consistent, but due to the instigation and sowing of discord by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, disputes arose over some minor issues. What should be done? I reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two different kinds of contradictions and his series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, understanding that we must grasp the main contradiction and adhere to the direction of the struggle to resolve the contradictions between these two revolutionary mass organizations. On the one hand, I must first firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and never allow the struggle to be directed against the revolutionary masses; on the other hand, I must also patiently help the broad revolutionary masses firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, enhance their awareness of the enemy, and make them realize that the only enemy we have in common is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; causing disputes and engaging in "internal warfare" within revolutionary organizations can only make friends suffer and enemies rejoice. Therefore, I further went deep into the workers' masses, enthusiastically talked with them, actively propagated Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and together with the leaders of the two revolutionary organizations, studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "The two kinds of contradictions—those between the enemy and us and those among the people—are different in nature and must be resolved by different methods. In brief, the former is a question of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and the latter is a question of distinguishing between right and wrong." Chairman Mao's teaching illuminated everyone's eyes, raised their class consciousness, and made them realize that with the enemy at hand, the issues of right and wrong within revolutionary organizations should be subordinated to the direction of the struggle; immediately, both sides carried out internal rectification, correctly handled disagreements according to the method of "unity—criticism—unity," and reached a relatively consistent opinion. On this basis, the factory launched a major criticism of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, making the broad revolutionary masses more clearly see the ugly nature and harm to the revolution of this big backer. The masses who had been deceived exposed the factory's power-holders taking the capitalist road who instigated the masses to fight against each other to protect their own clique. In this way, the revolutionary criticism promoted revolutionary unity, and the broad revolutionary masses directed their class hatred towards the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The workers said well: "We revolutionary rebels listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We will never treat comrades as enemies, nor will we treat enemies as comrades. The enemy's plot to divert our direction of struggle will never succeed!"

From this, I realized that grasping the direction of the struggle is inseparable from distinguishing between enemies and ourselves and correctly handling contradictions among the people. Only by firmly grasping the direction of the struggle and grasping the main contradiction, that is, the contradiction between the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, can we resolve the contradictions within revolutionary mass organizations, unite the broad masses and cadres, strengthen the leftist forces, and achieve revolutionary unity. Only by correctly handling contradictions among the people can we to the greatest extent isolate and severely strike down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose them.

### 分清敌我，抓住主要矛盾

    掌握斗争的大方向　团结群众的大多数
    ——南京部队某部侦察连学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》讲用会发言选登
    在纪念伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年的时候，南京部队学习毛主席著作先进单位、某部侦察连的同志举行了讲用会，介绍了在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用这篇光辉著作、积极支持左派广大群众的体会。下面是部分同志在讲用会上的发言。
    分清敌我，抓住主要矛盾	 排长  陈学政
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“为了正确地认识敌我之间和人民内部这两类不同的矛盾，应该首先弄清楚什么是人民，什么是敌人。”分清敌我的问题，是革命的首要问题，是决定能不能坚持斗争大方向的问题，也是正确处理人民内部矛盾的前提。
    无产阶级文化大革命斗争的大方向是什么呢？就是集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象，是无产阶级最危险的敌人。他们同广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾，是敌我矛盾，是我们无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要矛盾。只有分清敌我，紧紧抓住这个主要矛盾，才能牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，才能正确对待革命群众。
    不久以前，我去一个工厂执行支左任务。当时厂里的两个革命群众组织正在打“内战”。经过深入了解，发现他们斗争的大方向本来是一致的，但是由于党内走资本主义道路当权派的挑拨离间，在一些枝节问题上引起了争论。怎么办呢？我重温了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的教导和对无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，懂得了必须抓住主要矛盾，坚持斗争大方向，来解决这两个革命群众组织之间的矛盾。一方面，自己应当首先牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，绝不允许把斗争矛头指向革命群众；另一方面，还要耐心帮助广大革命群众牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，增强敌情观念，使他们认识到，只有党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才是我们共同的敌人；在革命组织之间搞纠纷，打“内战”，只能使亲者痛、仇者快。于是，我进一步深入到工人群众中去，满腔热情地同他们谈心，积极宣传毛主席制定的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，并且和两个革命组织的负责人一起学习了毛主席这一教导：“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”毛主席的教导，擦亮了大家的眼睛，提高了阶级觉悟，认识到大敌当前，革命组织之间的是非问题，应该服从斗争的大方向；紧接着，双方通过内部整风，按照“团结——批评——团结”的方法，正确地处理了意见分歧，取得了比较一致的意见。在这个基础上，厂里开展了对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，使广大革命群众更加认清了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的这个总后台的丑恶本质和他对革命的危害。曾经受蒙蔽的群众纷纷起来揭发工厂内走资本主义道路当权派挑动群众斗群众，来保护他们一小撮的阴谋诡计。就这样，革命的大批判推动了革命的大联合，促使广大革命群众把阶级仇恨集中到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派头上。工人同志们说得好：“我们革命造反派最听毛主席的话，我们绝不把同志当成敌人，也绝不把敌人当成同志。阶级敌人妄图转移我们斗争大方向的阴谋绝不能得逞！”
    从这里我体会到，掌握斗争的大方向，是同分清敌我、正确处理人民内部矛盾分不开的。只有牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，抓住主要矛盾，即广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间的矛盾，才能促使革命群众组织内部的矛盾迎刃而解，从而团结广大群众和广大干部，壮大左派队伍，实现革命的大联合。只有正确处理人民内部矛盾，才能最大限度地孤立和狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
