The Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee issued a solemn statement on June 10, strongly condemning the new fascist atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The committee firmly supports the joint strike by Chinese workers in British institutions and some British-owned enterprises in Hong Kong. The committee calls on compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to further mobilize and launch a new wave of anti-British and anti-violence struggles.

The statement says that the British authorities in Hong Kong are intensifying their persecution of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. On the night of June 9, the fascist police and secret agents of the British authorities brazenly used fascist gangster methods to storm into the Silver Theatre. They tore down the slogans "Long Live Chairman Mao," the quotations from Chairman Mao, big-character posters, and pictures posted inside the theatre. They viciously smashed the statue of Chairman Mao and brutally beat and illegally arrested more than 20 managers and staff of the theatre. This is a serious insult to our great leader Chairman Mao and an attempt by the British authorities to suppress the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought and extinguish the burning flames of anti-British and anti-violence struggles among the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon. We cannot tolerate this and strongly protest!

The statement says that the British authorities, with bloodstains from their previous large-scale repressions still fresh, recently created the "June 8" massacre in To Kwa Wan, Kowloon. The deep hatred and blood debt will never be forgotten, and blood debts must be repaid with blood. We must settle accounts thoroughly! The statement pays high tribute to the workers and patriotic compatriots fighting on the front lines and expresses deep condolences to the families of the martyrs.

The statement says that the more the British imperialists face collapse, the more frantically and brutally they act. The British authorities' desperate struggles expose their cowardice and weakness, as well as their fascist gangster brutality. They are continuing their reckless actions and carrying out more large-scale bloody repressions. We must be vigilant against the enemy's plots and give a resolute response to any of their attacks.

The statement says that we must firmly respond to the call of our great motherland, immediately further mobilize and organize, and bravely fight against the evil British imperialists. On June 10, Chinese workers in British institutions and some British-owned enterprises in Hong Kong held a massive joint strike, marking the start of escalating the anti-persecution struggle. The heroic anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggles of the workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon are excellent, and we, the patriotic compatriots in all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, firmly support them.

The statement says, let us compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon prepare for everything and launch a new wave of anti-British and anti-violence struggles, launching a more fierce counterattack against the evil British reactionary rule!

    港九反迫害斗争委员会发表声明强烈谴责港英当局新暴行
    坚决支持香港工人联合大罢工
    号召掀起反英抗暴斗争新高潮
    新华社香港十三日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会十日发表严正声明，强烈谴责港英当局制造新的法西斯暴行，坚决支持港英机构中国工人和一些英资企业中国工人举行的联合大罢工，号召港九爱国同胞进一步动员起来，掀起一个反英抗暴斗争的新高潮。
    声明说，港英当局对我港九爱国同胞的迫害正在加紧升级。六月九日晚，港英法西斯警察和特务竟悍然使用法西斯强盗手段，闯入银都戏院，撕毁戏院内张贴的“毛主席万岁”的标语、毛主席语录、大字报和图片等，还极端恶毒地把毛主席塑像打烂，并残酷毒打和非法逮捕戏院经理和职工二十多人。这是港英当局对我们伟大领袖毛主席的严重侮辱，是它妄图遏阻伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，扑灭港九同胞蓬勃兴起的反英抗暴怒火的又一次血腥暴行。对此我们绝对不能容忍，提出最最强烈的抗议！
    声明说，港英当局几次大镇压血迹未干，日前又在九龙土瓜湾制造了“六·八”大血案，血海深仇，我们没齿难忘，血债必须血还，杀人必须偿命。我们一定要进行彻底清算！声明向战斗在第一线上的港九工人和爱国同胞致以崇高的敬礼，向壮烈牺牲的工友家属致以亲人的慰问。
    声明说，英帝国主义越是面临崩溃，就越是疯狂，越是残暴。港英当局疯狂的垂死挣扎，暴露了它的怯懦和虚弱，也暴露了它的法西斯强盗的凶残面目。它正在继续蛮干，进行更大规模的血腥镇压。我们必须注视敌人的阴谋，给敌人的任何进攻以坚决的回击。
    声明说，我们要坚决响应伟大祖国的号召，立即进一步动员起来，组织起来，勇猛地向万恶的英帝国主义展开斗争。六月十日，港英机构的中国工人和一些英资企业的中国工人举行了声势浩大的联合大罢工，打响了把反迫害斗争再升一级的第一炮。港九工人兄弟的英勇反帝抗暴斗争好得很，我们港九各界爱国同胞表示坚决支持。
    声明说，让我们港九爱国同胞做好一切准备，掀起一个反英抗暴斗争的新高潮，向万恶的港英反动统治展开更猛烈的反击！
