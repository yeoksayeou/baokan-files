In the conspiracy of American and British imperialism and the betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership, although the anti-aggression war of the Arab countries has suffered a temporary setback, the fury of the Arab people's struggle against American imperialism is still burning fiercely. The American imperialists and their accomplices can force the Arab countries to "cease fire," but they will never be able to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle.

Currently, the masses in the capitals of various Arab countries are holding massive demonstrations and marches, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of American and British imperialism. Many Arab countries have announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the United States; many Arab countries have stopped exporting oil to American and British imperialists; the United Arab Republic has closed the Suez Canal. Some Arab countries' people are demanding that the government provide them with weapons to resist aggression; workers in some regions refuse to transport oil to nearby imperialist military bases. The Arab people are striking back at American imperialism and its lackeys in various ways. "Down with American and British colonialism and their lackey Israel!" "The Soviet revisionists are traitors!" "We will fight!" The powerful voices of the people echo across the Arab lands. The Arab people are truly great! They are heroic, unyielding, and invincible people.

The contradiction between the Arab people and American imperialism and its lackeys is irreconcilable. Imperialism and colonialism have long subjected the Arab world to savage exploitation, plunder, oppression, and aggression. The Arab people have waged heroic and arduous struggles for national independence. Currently, the imperialists led by the United States, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, are using Israel as a tool of aggression to push forward their nefarious plans of neo-colonialism, seriously threatening the survival of the Arab nation. The Arab people do not want to see their homeland fall into ruin, nor do they want to be slaves of neo-colonialism. They have already expressed their determination to fight this anti-aggression war to the end.

War awakens the people and educates the people. In the midst of war, in just a few days, the Arab people's awareness has risen as much as it would in many years of peace. This anti-aggression war has mobilized, educated, and tempered the people.

Through this war, the Arab people have further recognized that American imperialism is their mortal enemy, and they must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about it. Only by engaging in a head-on struggle with American imperialism can the Arab people's national liberation cause continually achieve victory.

Through this war, the Arab people have begun to see the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique as an accomplice of American imperialism. They have further distinguished between friends and enemies. In this way, they will not be deceived by the honey-tongued imperialist spies and accomplices, but will be able to unite with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and with the revolutionary people of the world, steadfastly leading the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle to victory.

The various countries, classes, and political forces in the Arab world will naturally have different views on the current Middle East situation. However, one thing is clear: if someone does not direct the spearhead of the struggle against the Arab people's mortal enemies and their allies, but instead tries to direct it against the friends of the Arab people and speak for the enemies' friends, then they will never gain the support of the Arab people and will be despised and rejected by the Arab people.

Through this war, the Arab people have undergone a severe test. They will learn and grow stronger through struggle. New forces will continually emerge from among the people. These new forces will grow and become the backbone of the Arab nation.

The path of struggle is always tortuous, not straight. The people will always have to go through various twists and turns and arduous journeys to continually push the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause forward.

Now, although the Arab people have suffered a temporary setback on the battlefield, it is nothing to worry about. Didn't the Vietnamese people overcome numerous difficulties and go through a long, arduous struggle before achieving the great situation they have now? As long as the Arab people can summarize experiences, learn lessons, organize and accumulate strength, and persist in struggle, then they will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and open up a bright future.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The wave of indignation of the people of the world against the American aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism and its lackeys will definitely achieve even greater victories."

In the Arab countries, the countercurrents created by imperialism and the Soviet revisionists will never be able to suppress the main current of the Arab national liberation movement. The anti-American fury of the Arab people is irresistible, and the anti-American fury of the people of the world is irresistible.

Today's world has entered a new and great era. The revolutionary forces of the people of various countries far outweigh the counter-revolutionary forces. The international situation and the balance of international class forces are greatly favorable to the Arab people.

The struggle of the Arab people has the support and assistance of the people of the world. The struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the just struggles of the people of the world, are all mutually supportive and mutually assisting. The Arab people's anti-aggression struggle is a powerful support and encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are bravely resisting American imperialism and to the people of the world who are waging anti-imperialist struggles. Similarly, the great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American war of national liberation and the national liberation struggles of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also strong support for the struggle of the Arab people.

The 700 million people of China are the most reliable and loyal comrades of the Arab people in the anti-imperialist struggle. The Chinese people stand firmly and wholeheartedly on the side of the Arab people. We firmly believe that the Arab people, united and through long and heroic struggles, will definitely be able to thoroughly defeat American imperialism and its lackeys and achieve great victories.

### 阿拉伯人民反美怒潮不可阻挡

    阿拉伯人民反美怒潮不可阻挡
    在美英帝国主义合谋和苏修领导集团的出卖下，尽管阿拉伯国家的反侵略战争遭受了一时的挫折，但是阿拉伯人民反美斗争的怒火仍在熊熊燃烧。美帝国主义及其帮凶，可以压迫阿拉伯国家“停火”，但却永远熄灭不了阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的革命火焰。
    目前，阿拉伯各国首都的广大群众纷纷举行声势浩大的游行示威，愤怒声讨美英帝国主义的滔天罪行。许多阿拉伯国家宣布同美国断绝了外交关系；许多阿拉伯国家停止对美英帝国主义输送石油；阿联封闭了苏伊士运河。有的阿拉伯国家人民要求政府发给武器，抵抗侵略；有的地区工人拒绝输送石油给邻近的帝国主义军事基地。阿拉伯人民正在用各种方式打击美帝国主义及其走狗。“打倒美英殖民主义及其走狗以色列！”“苏修是背叛者！”“我们要战斗！”人民的强大的呼声，响彻在阿拉伯的大地。阿拉伯人民是多么好啊！他们是英雄的人民，不屈不挠的人民，不可战胜的人民。
    阿拉伯人民同美帝国主义及其走狗的矛盾，是不可调和的。帝国主义和殖民主义对阿拉伯世界进行了长期的野蛮的剥削、掠夺、压迫和侵略，阿拉伯人民为争取民族独立进行过英勇的艰巨的斗争。当前，以美国为首的帝国主义勾结苏修领导集团，利用以色列这个侵略工具，加紧推行新殖民主义罪恶计划，严重地威胁着阿拉伯民族的生存。阿拉伯人民不愿意看到自己的国土沦丧，不愿做新殖民主义的奴隶，他们已经表示决心，誓将这场反侵略斗争进行到底。
    战争唤醒了人民，教育了人民。在战争的烽火中，仅仅几天之内，阿拉伯人民觉悟的提高，等于平时好多年。这一场反侵略战争，起了动员人民，教育人民，锻炼人民的作用。
    通过这场战争，阿拉伯人民进一步认识了美帝国主义是他们的死敌，绝不能对它抱有任何不切实际的幻想。只有同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，阿拉伯人民的民族解放事业才能不断地取得胜利。
    通过这场战争，阿拉伯人民开始认识了苏修叛徒集团作为美帝国主义帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。他们进一步分清了敌友。这样，他们就能够不上那些口蜜腹剑的帝国主义奸细、帮凶的当，而能够同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，同全世界革命人民团结在一起，坚定不移地把反帝革命斗争引向胜利。
    阿拉伯各国，各个阶级，各种政治力量很自然地会对当前的中东局势表示各种不同的观点。但是，有一点是清楚的，如果有人不是把斗争的锋芒指向阿拉伯人民的死敌及其一伙，而是企图指向阿拉伯人民的朋友，而为敌人的朋友帮腔，那么，他们就决不能得到阿拉伯人民的响应，就会受到阿拉伯人民的鄙视和唾弃。
    通过这场战争，阿拉伯人民得到了一次严峻的考验，他们将在斗争中学习，在斗争中锻炼成长。人民中间将会不断涌现出新生的力量。这种新生力量势将发展壮大，成为阿拉伯民族的中流砥柱。
    斗争的道路总是曲折的，不是笔直的。人民总是要经过各种曲折和艰巨的历程，把反帝革命事业不断地推向前进。
    现在，阿拉伯人民尽管在战场上一时失利，但这没有什么了不起。越南人民不是经过了克服重重困难，经历了长期艰巨的斗争，才打出象现在那样的一个大好局面来的吗？只要阿拉伯人民善于从曲折中总结经验，吸取教训，组织和积聚力量，坚持斗争，那末就一定能够排除万难，去开辟光明的前途。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”
    在阿拉伯各国，帝国主义和苏修所制造的逆流，绝对压不倒阿拉伯民族解放运动的主流。阿拉伯人民的反美怒潮是不可阻挡的，全世界人民的反美怒潮是不可阻挡的。
    今天的世界已进入了一个新的伟大的时代。各国人民的革命力量大大压倒了反革命力量。国际形势，国际阶级力量的对比，大大有利于阿拉伯人民。
    阿拉伯人民的斗争有着全世界人民的支持和援助。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争，世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是相互支持，相互援助的。阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争，对于正在英勇地抗击着美帝国主义的越南人民和进行着反帝斗争的世界各国人民，都是有力的支持和鼓舞。同样，越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利和亚、非、拉的民族解放斗争，也都是对阿拉伯人民斗争的强大支援。
    七亿中国人民是阿拉伯人民在反帝斗争中的最可靠最忠实的战友。中国人民坚定地、全心全意地站在阿拉伯人民一边。我们坚决相信，阿拉伯人民团结起来，经过长期英勇的斗争，一定能够彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗，一定能够取得伟大的胜利。
