The Arab countries are taking various measures to counter the threat of aggression from U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, the Arab countries are taking various measures to counter the threat of aggression from U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

The Syrian head of state, Ateishi, recently emphasized in a meeting with members of the Arab Trade Union International Federation that the only language imperialism understands is armed struggle. He said that the current discussions in the United Nations and the Security Council are merely a prelude to the imperialist and Israeli aggression against the Arabs. They are trying to prepare international public opinion to pave the way for their aggressive actions.

Syrian Prime Minister Zain said on the 1st during a reception of a Sudanese delegation that the Syrian people have been mobilized for battle, and the army is ready for combat.

Volunteer registration offices have been established in all provinces of the United Arab Republic, starting from the 3rd, to accept applications for the newly formed People's Resistance Army. The first batch of young volunteers, after receiving training in civil defense, first aid, and nursing, graduated on the 2nd in Cairo and Giza Province.

According to a report by the Cairo-based Al-Ahram newspaper, Egyptian President Nasser recently chaired an important military meeting attended by senior officers. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Egyptian National Assembly issued a statement on the 3rd condemning the plot by imperialist countries to use force to open the Gulf of Aqaba for Israel. The statement said: Any attempt by the U.S., Britain, and other countries in this regard will be considered an "undeclared war" by the Arab people. It will not only be retaliated against by the Egyptian people but also by the people of all Arab countries.

Iraq has already sent troops to Syria and the United Arab Republic in recent days. According to a report from Amman on the 3rd, a batch of Iraqi troops has already entered Jordan and taken up positions with the Jordanian army. Iraqi Air Force planes have also flown into Jordanian air bases.

According to a report by the Sana'a radio station, after the Yemeni cabinet decided to send troops to the United Arab Republic to counter the threat of aggression from U.S. imperialism and Israel, the first batch of Yemeni armed forces left the Yemeni capital Sana'a for Cairo on the 3rd.

In Algeria, there are 1,000 Palestinians residing. Now, 700 of them have reported to the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Algiers to enlist, eager to take up arms and head to the front lines to fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The director of this office, Kassem, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: Every day, people come to enlist in droves. Many Algerians are also eager to volunteer.

According to a report by the Middle East News Agency on the 3rd, Libyan King Idris has ordered Libyan ground troops to move to the United Arab Republic and take up positions on the front lines. He also agreed to allow Algerian troops to pass through Libyan territory on their way to the United Arab Republic.

Libyan Foreign Minister Bishrti, who is visiting Cairo, said after meeting with President Nasser on the 3rd that he had conveyed Libya's decision to Nasser: Libya will not allow Wheeler Base or any other place in Libyan territory to be used as a base for aggression against Arab countries or to provide any assistance to Israel. He said that if this decision is violated, the Libyan government will cancel the U.S. Wheeler Base and unilaterally abolish the military agreement regarding the establishment of this base. Bishrti also said that Libya will cut off oil supplies to any country that invades Arab countries, and Libyan troops have been ordered to be on alert.

    伊拉克在前几天已派军队到叙利亚和阿联。据安曼三日消息说，有一批伊拉克军队已经开入约旦，并且同约旦军队进入阵地。伊拉克空军飞机也已飞入约旦空军基地。

    据中东通讯社三日报道，利比亚国王伊德里斯已经命令利比亚陆军部队开往阿联，进入前线阵地。他还同意阿尔及利亚的军队在开往阿联途中通过利比亚领土。
    正在开罗访问的利比亚外交大臣比什提三日在拜会纳赛尔总统后向中东通讯社记者说，他已向纳赛尔转达了利比亚的决定：利比亚决不允许把惠勒斯基地或利比亚领土上的其他任何地方用来作为侵略阿拉伯国家或向以色列提供任何援助的基地。他说，如违反这个决定，利比亚政府将取消美国的惠勒斯基地，并单方面废除关于设置这个基地的军事协定。比什提还说，利比亚将对侵略阿拉伯国家的任何国家切断石油供应，利比亚军队已奉命处于戒备状态。
