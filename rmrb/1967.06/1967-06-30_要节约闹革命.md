Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Save to make revolution." This is not just an economic issue, but a major political one. Frugality and waste represent two fundamentally opposing worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The proletariat has always been the most frugal, while the bourgeoisie is wasteful. We must clearly recognize that after the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, if we cannot maintain a frugal and thrifty style, we will become detached from the masses, and we will be hit by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. In this way, we will lose the power we have seized. Every revolutionary comrade must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and be thrifty and frugal forever.

Pay Attention to Saving Paper When Writing Big Character Posters

Revolutionary big character posters are orders to mobilize the masses. However, some mass organizations use these posters as tools for "internal warfare." These posters often use one large sheet of paper for one character, or even several sheets for one character, resulting in the use of dozens of sheets of paper and several buckets of glue for one poster. In some places, big character posters are pasted up only to be covered by others.

It is normal for revolutionary mass organizations to have disagreements and differences. These can be resolved through big character posters and debates to find the correct solutions. Big character posters with only a few words cannot clearly present the facts or explain the reasoning. The result is a waste of a large amount of paper without solving the problem, and it will only widen the differences between the organizations.

Chairman Mao teaches us that for the revolutionary cause, we must "save every penny." We must remember this teaching.

Use Cheap Materials to Make Substitute Ink

Recently, our newspaper has received many letters from readers suggesting the use of cheap materials to make substitute ink.

Some letters say that writing big character posters requires a lot of ink. In one school, the most ink used in a day was dozens of large bottles, costing dozens of yuan. The letters say that we must actively respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "save to make revolution." We must write revolutionary big character posters and find ways to save.

Some letters introduce the use of chimney soot and other materials to make substitute ink. Some readers suggest using boiled green dye mixed with water, or using construction material green ash mixed with water to make substitute ink. There are also letters from steel plant readers saying that they use a large amount of steel slag waste, mixed with water to replace ink for writing big character posters or small character posters, with good results.

Do Not Reprint Learning Reference Materials

During the Cultural Revolution, some mass organizations reprinted some learning reference materials, which played a certain role in exchanging information and promoting the movement. However, some mass organizations took an irresponsible attitude towards this serious political work, resulting in waste. For example, some identical learning materials were reprinted multiple times, resulting in them not being distributed after printing; some reprinted materials did not match the struggle situation in the region or unit, and were set aside after being distributed. It is particularly worth noting that some reprinted materials had not been carefully verified for content, leading to errors and having a negative political impact.

We believe that in the spirit of "save to make revolution," any redundant or unnecessary materials should not be reprinted; necessary materials should also pay attention to accurate content. We must achieve no waste of paper, ink, or wax paper.

### 要节约闹革命

专栏：

    要节约闹革命
    编者按：毛主席教导我们“要节约闹革命”。这不仅是个经济问题，而且是个重大的政治问题。节约和浪费，是无产阶级同资产阶级两种根本对立的世界观的表现。无产阶级，从来都是最讲节约的，资产阶级才挥霍浪费。我们必须清醒地认识到，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，如果不能保持艰苦朴素勤俭节约的作风，就会脱离广大的人民群众，就会被资产阶级糖衣炮弹打中。这样，我们就会把夺来的权丢掉。我们每个革命同志一定要牢记毛主席的教导，勤俭节约，永不变色。
    写大标语要注意节约纸张
    革命的大标语，是鼓舞广大群众的动员令。但是，有些群众组织，却把标语作为打“内战”的手段。这些标语常常是一张大纸写一个字，甚至几张纸一个字，一条标语就得用几十张纸，好几桶浆糊。有些地方大标语刚贴出，又被旁的大标语盖住了。
    革命群众组织之间，有意见，有分歧，是正常的，可以用大字报、大辩论，求得正确的解决。大标语寥寥几个字，事实摆不清楚，道理说不明白，其结果是浪费了大量纸张，解决不了问题，还会扩大各组织之间的分歧。
    毛主席教导我们，为着革命事业要“节省每一个铜板”。我们要牢记这个教导。

    用廉价材料制造代用墨汁
    最近本报接到许多读者来信，建议用价钱便宜的材料，制造代用墨汁。
    有的来信说，写大字报要用很多墨汁，有个学校最多的一天用了几十大瓶，价值几十元。来信说，我们要积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的号召，既要写革命的大字报，又要想办法节约。
    有的来信介绍用烟囱灰等做材料，制成代用墨汁。有的读者建议用煮青颜料兑水，或用建筑材料青灰调水，即可做成代用墨汁。还有炼钢厂的读者来信说，他们利用炼钢的大量废物红泥，和上水代替墨汁，写大字报或小字报，效果很好。
    印学习参考材料不要重复
    在文化大革命运动中，有些群众组织翻印了一些学习参考材料，这对交流情况，推动运动，起了一定的作用。但是，有些群众组织，对这一严肃的政治工作，采取了不负责的态度，以致造成了浪费。例如：有些相同的学习材料，重复翻印多次，以致印完后发不出去；有些翻印的材料，和本地区、本单位的斗争形势不相适应，发下去就被放在一边。特别应该指出的是，有些翻印的材料，内容没有经过认真核实，发生错误，在政治上造成了不良影响。
    我们认为，本着“要节约闹革命”的精神，凡是重复的、可印可不印的材料，就不要翻印；必要翻印的材料，也应该注意内容准确。要做到不浪费一张纸、一滴油墨、一张腊纸。
