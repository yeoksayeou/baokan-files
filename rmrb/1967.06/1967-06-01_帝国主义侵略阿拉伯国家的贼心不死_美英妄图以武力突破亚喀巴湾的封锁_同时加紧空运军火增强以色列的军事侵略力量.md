The U.S. and British imperialists, after mobilizing a large number of warships to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, are plotting military actions to break through the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba by the United Arab Republic.

According to a report by the British *Daily Mail* on May 30, the U.S. and Britain are planning to organize a naval task force with France and Canada in the Red Sea to "escort" Israeli ships through the Gulf of Aqaba. To achieve this goal, discussions on a four-nation emergency naval agreement are being conducted urgently.

The report states that U.S. and British aircraft carriers have been ordered to stand by, ready to be deployed "if this escort system is not sufficient to intimidate the Egyptian blockaders."

The report also mentions that the U.S. and Britain consider French support to be important and hope that the French Navy stationed at the Red Sea port of Djibouti in Somalia will also participate in the task force.

According to another report by Western news agencies, William Martin, the commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean, also boasted on May 30 that the U.S. intends to break the UAR's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba and has military plans to carry out this act of aggression.

On the same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban, at a press conference in Tel Aviv, declared: "If necessary, Israel will take unilateral action to end the blockade of the port of Eilat (located at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba)." He added, "If possible, we will act together with other countries."

Meanwhile, the U.S. is also plotting a so-called "compromise plan" to break the UAR's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba. According to a report by the *International Herald Tribune* on May 30, the U.S. government's plan aims to force the UAR to allow all foreign ships, not flying the Israeli flag but carrying supplies for Israel, to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba.

As previously reported, to counter the threat of Israeli aggression, UAR President Nasser announced on May 22 that Israeli ships would not be allowed to enter or leave this important gulf.

According to a report by the New China News Agency on May 30, the U.S. and British imperialists are hurriedly airlifting military supplies to Israel to strengthen Israel's military capabilities in its aggression against Arab countries.

According to a report by the Cairo *Al-Ahram* on May 29, there has been large-scale activity at the U.S. Wheeler Air Force Base in Libya, where military equipment and ammunition are being airlifted to Israel. The Wheeler Air Force Base is the largest U.S. air base in Africa.

According to Agence France-Presse, after the recent U.S. instigation of large-scale armed provocations by Israel against Middle Eastern Arab countries, Theodore Conway, the commander of the U.S. "Forward Strike Command," flew from the U.S. to the U.S. European Command in Heidelberg, West Germany, on May 24, and then to Libya the next day to deploy military aggression against the Middle East.

According to a report by the London *Sunday Telegraph* on May 28, weapons have already begun to be airlifted between Britain and Israel. Israeli military transport planes have been flying between the British RAF base in Watton and Israel over the past three days, airlifting weapons and parts for Israeli forces. The report states that Britain has recently provided tanks to the Israeli military and signed contracts to supply ammunition. Britain has also supplied light weapons and tank parts to Israel.

    帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的贼心不死
    美英妄图以武力突破亚喀巴湾的封锁
    同时加紧空运军火增强以色列的军事侵略力量
    新华社三十一日讯　美、英帝国主义在调动大批军舰赶到东地中海和红海集结之后，正阴谋策划采取军事行动，企图冲破阿联对亚喀巴湾的封锁。
    据英国《每日邮报》三十日透露，美、英正在策划拉法国和加拿大一起在红海里组织一支海军特遣队，“护送”以色列船只通过亚喀巴湾。为了达到这个目的，草拟一个四国紧急海军协定的讨论正在紧张进行中。
    消息说，美、英航空母舰已受命随时待命，以便在“这种护航制度还不足以吓住埃及封锁者时出动”。
    消息还说，美、英两国认为法国给予支持是重要的，它们希望驻在索马里海岸的红海港口吉布提的法国海军也参加这个特遣队。
    另据西方通讯社报道，停留在地中海的美国第六舰队的司令威廉·马丁三十日也叫嚣说，美国打算破坏阿联对亚喀巴湾的封锁，并且已有完成这一侵略行动的军事计划。
    同一天，以色列外交部长埃班在特拉维夫举行的记者招待会上叫嚷：“如果有必要，以色列将单独采取行动来结束对（以色列）埃拉特港（按：在亚喀巴湾的北端）的封锁”。“如果可能的话，将同其它国家”一起行动。
    与此同时，美国还在策划一项破坏阿联封锁亚喀巴湾的所谓“折衷方案”。据美国《国际先驱论坛报》三十日报道，美国政府搞的这项方案，目的在于强迫阿联让那些不挂以色列旗但为以色列运输物资的一切外国船只通过亚喀巴湾。
    前已报道，为了对付以色列的侵略威胁，阿联总统纳赛尔在五月二十二日宣布不准以色列船只出入这个重要的海湾。
    据新华社三十日讯　美、英帝国主义正在加紧空运军火给以色列，以增强以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的军事力量。
    据开罗《金字塔报》二十九日报道，在利比亚的美国惠勒斯空军基地，有向以色列空运军事装备和弹药的大规模活动。惠勒斯空军基地是美帝国主义在非洲最大的空军基地。
    据法新社透露，在美帝国主义最近指使以色列对中东阿拉伯国家发动大规模的武装挑衅以后，“美国进击司令部”总司令西奥多·康韦二十四日曾从美国赶到西德海德堡的驻欧美军司令部，并在第二天飞到利比亚，部署对中东的武装侵略活动。
    另据伦敦《星期日电讯报》二十八日报道，在英国和以色列之间已经开始了武器空运。以色列军用运输机在过去的三天中，曾来往于英国华丁顿空军基地和以色列之间，为以色列部队空运武器和零件。消息说，英国最近给以色列军队提供了坦克，并签订了供应弹药的合同。英国还向以色列供应轻武器和坦克零件。
