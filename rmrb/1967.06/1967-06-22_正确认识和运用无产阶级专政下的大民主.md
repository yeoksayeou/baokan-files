In his epoch-making great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao has profoundly expounded on the class nature of democracy, the proletarian democratic centralism, and the Marxist-Leninist theory on democracy and dictatorship, democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline. This is of great significance for us to correctly understand and apply the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, and to politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to achieve and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and to accomplish the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: "In the world, there is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy; there is no abstract freedom and abstract democracy. In a society of class struggle, if the exploiting class has the freedom to exploit the laboring people, the laboring people will have no freedom not to be exploited. If the bourgeoisie has democracy, the proletariat and the laboring people will have no democracy."

Throughout the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class, class contradictions, and class struggle always exist. Of course, democracy has class nature; it is either proletarian democracy or bourgeois democracy. Abstract, classless democracy does not exist at all.

Our democracy is proletarian democracy, which means practicing democracy towards the proletariat and all people who support and participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and practicing dictatorship towards class enemies who resist the socialist revolution and sabotage socialist construction. However, the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, do just the opposite. In the regions and departments they control, they turn proletarian democracy into bourgeois democracy. They practice democracy and grant freedom to the landlords and bourgeoisie, allowing ghosts and monsters to come out of their lairs and allowing anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weeds to spread freely, while practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the people.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are carrying out is to mobilize the masses to use the method of great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat to expose and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to smash their bourgeois democracy and their plot to restore capitalism, to consolidate and strengthen proletarian democratic centralism, and to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Those who demand abstract freedom and abstract democracy regard democracy as a goal, not acknowledging that democracy is a means. Sometimes democracy seems to be a goal, but in reality, it is only a means. Marxism tells us that democracy belongs to the superstructure, to the category of politics. This means that ultimately, it serves the economic base." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching. This is the guideline for us to correctly understand and use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

What kind of means is the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat? What is it used for? Who is it directed against? What goal is it aimed at? The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a method and means of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is used to deal with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to achieve the goal of smashing this handful of class enemies, consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, maintaining and developing the socialist economic base, and preventing the restoration of capitalism. If this goal is departed from, it is not proletarian democracy but will lead to the path of bourgeois democracy.

We must always pay attention to the fact that using the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, not to weaken and destroy the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is to consolidate and develop the socialist economic base, not to weaken and destroy the socialist economic base.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the criterion for judging whether a mass organization correctly uses the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is to see whether, when using great democracy, it directs the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, whether it is for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and whether it is for maintaining the socialist economic base. This is the most fundamental standard. If this standard is departed from and the direction and goal of the struggle are not considered, then the major issues will not be distinguished.

The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is also a means for the people internally. It is to use this method of great democracy, using the methods of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big debates to distinguish right from wrong, to correctly resolve contradictions among the people, to develop and strengthen the leftist forces, to gradually unite more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres, to achieve the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and to the greatest extent isolate and strike at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, various revolutionary mass organizations, within a mass organization, will inevitably have different opinions and contradictions. This is an unavoidable and normal phenomenon. Such opinions and contradictions are issues of ideological understanding and belong to contradictions among the people. They should be resolved according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," using democratic methods, methods of criticism and self-criticism, and methods of presenting facts and reasoning. Chairman Mao pointed out: "All issues of an ideological nature, all issues of debate among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive and suppressive methods." Chairman Mao's teaching is the only correct method for us to handle contradictions among the people. A mass organization and the responsible person of a mass organization should, when dealing with mass organizations holding different opinions, and with the masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations, start from the desire for unity, resolve contradictions through criticism or struggle, and absolutely not use force to suppress, absolutely not treat the masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations as enemies, and absolutely not direct the struggle against them.

As the responsible person of a revolutionary mass organization, after changing from a suppressed position to a position of power, one should pay even more attention to correctly using the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the past, by mobilizing the broad masses and using the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we exposed the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and seized their power. Today, we still need to use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat to politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. At the same time, we should learn to use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat to correctly handle contradictions among the people, correctly handle different opinions among the people, and especially dare to advocate democracy, accept criticism from the revolutionary masses, correct shortcomings and mistakes, truly hold power for the proletariat, and use power for the proletariat.

The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, within the people, is relative to the high degree of concentration of the proletariat. Democracy and concentration are two opposing and unified aspects. Without the great democracy of the proletariat, there is no high degree of concentration of the proletariat, and without the high degree of concentration of the proletariat, there is no great democracy of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao said: "Within the people, democracy is relative to concentration, and freedom is relative to discipline. These are two opposing aspects of a unified whole, and they are contradictory and unified. We should not emphasize one aspect while negating the other. Within the people, there cannot be freedom without discipline, and there cannot be democracy without concentration. This unity of democracy and concentration, this unity of freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism. Under this system, the people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom; at the same time, they must also discipline themselves with socialist discipline."

Chairman Mao also said: "Democracy is democracy under centralized guidance, not anarchism. Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people."

The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the great democracy under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great democracy under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. When we use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat as a means, we must pay attention to maintaining and strengthening the concentration of the proletariat and absolutely not weaken the concentration of the proletariat; we must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions and use Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to guide our actual struggle. Only in this way can we ensure the smooth progress of the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. If democracy is regarded as a goal and the concentration of the proletariat is opposed, that is anarchism. Anarchism is essentially bourgeois democracy, bourgeois liberalization. This very wrong tendency must be overcome in time.

The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat must be combined with consciously observing the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when we use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat as a means, we must overthrow the slavery advocated by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and smash their reactionary bourgeois discipline of suppressing the people. Overthrowing these things is precisely to strengthen the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. Therefore, when we use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must firmly maintain and strictly observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. We should, as Chairman Mao teaches us, "while enjoying extensive democracy and freedom, at the same time discipline ourselves with socialist discipline."

To correctly understand and use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most fundamental method is to strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to study and apply Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview, to break with selfishness and establish public spirit, and to promote ideological revolutionization. Only in this way can we firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, achieve the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    正确认识和运用无产阶级专政下的大民主
    洪晓斌
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇划时代的伟大著作中，精辟地阐述了民主的阶级性，阐述了无产阶级的民主集中制，阐述了马克思列宁主义关于民主与专政、民主与集中、自由与纪律的理论。这对于我们在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，正确地认识和运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭，实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，胜利地完成斗批改的任务，具有非常重要的意义。
    毛主席指出：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”
    在无产阶级专政的整个历史时代，始终存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。当然，民主是有阶级性的，不是无产阶级的民主，就是资产阶级的民主，超阶级的抽象的民主是根本不存在的。
    我们的民主，是无产阶级的民主，就是对无产阶级同一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的人民实行民主，对反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的阶级敌人不能给民主，而只能实行专政。但是，钻进无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却反其道而行之。在他们盘踞的一些地区和部门，把无产阶级的民主变成资产阶级的民主。他们对地主资产阶级讲民主，给自由，让牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，让反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的毒草自由泛滥，对人民则实行资产阶级专政。
    我们进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是放手发动群众，用无产阶级专政下大民主的方法，揭露和打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，粉碎他们的资产阶级民主，粉碎他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，巩固和加强无产阶级的民主集中制，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们：“要求抽象的自由、抽象的民主的人们认为民主是目的，而不承认民主是手段。民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。马克思主义告诉我们，民主属于上层建筑，属于政治这个范畴。这就是说，归根结蒂，它是为经济基础服务的。”我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的这个教导。这是我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，正确认识和使用无产阶级专政下的大民主的指南。
    无产阶级专政下的大民主是一种什么手段呢？用它来干什么呢？对付谁呢？要达到什么目的呢？无产阶级专政下的大民主，是无产阶级专政下进行革命的方法和手段，用它来对付党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，达到粉碎这一小撮阶级敌人，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，维护和发展社会主义的经济基础，防止资本主义复辟的目的。如果离开了这个目的，就不是无产阶级的民主，就要走到资产阶级民主的邪路上去。
    我们必须时刻注意，运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，是为了加强无产阶级专政，而绝不是削弱和破坏无产阶级专政，是为了巩固和发展社会主义的经济基础，而绝不是削弱和破坏社会主义的经济基础。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，衡量一个群众组织是否正确运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，就是看它在运用大民主的时候，是不是把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是不是为了巩固无产阶级专政，是不是为了维护社会主义的经济基础。这是最根本的标准。如果离开了这个标准，不看斗争的方向，斗争的目的，那就认不清大是大非。
    无产阶级专政下的大民主，对于人民内部来说，也是一种手段。就是用这种大民主的方法，用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，分清是非，正确地解决人民内部的矛盾，发展壮大左派队伍，逐步团结百分之九十五以上的群众和百分之九十五以上的干部，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，各个革命群众组织之间，一个群众组织内部，产生这样那样的意见，存在这样那样的矛盾，这是难免的，也是正常的现象。这种意见和矛盾，是思想认识问题，属于人民内部矛盾，应该按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式，采取民主的方法，批评与自我批评的方法，摆事实、讲道理的方法进行解决。毛主席指出：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”毛主席的这个教导，是我们处理人民内部矛盾的唯一正确的方法。一个群众组织，一个群众组织的负责人，对待持有不同意见的群众组织，对待受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众，都必须从团结的愿望出发，通过批评或者斗争去解决矛盾，而绝不能以势压人，绝不能把受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众，当作敌人看待，把斗争的矛头指向他们。
    作为革命群众组织的负责人，当自己从受压抑的地位变为当权的地位以后，就应当更加注意正确运用无产阶级专政下的大民主。过去，发动广大群众，运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺了他们的权，今天还要运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批透、批臭，完成本单位的斗批改。同时，要注意学会运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，正确处理人民内部矛盾，正确处理人民内部不同意见的分歧，特别是要敢于发扬民主，接受革命群众对自己的批评，改正缺点和错误，真正为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。
    无产阶级专政下的大民主，在人民内部，是对无产阶级的高度集中而言的。民主与集中是对立统一的两个方面。没有无产阶级的大民主，就没有无产阶级的高度集中，没有无产阶级的高度集中，也就没有无产阶级的大民主。
    毛主席说：“在人民内部，民主是对集中而言，自由是对纪律而言。这些都是一个统一体的两个矛盾着的侧面，它们是矛盾的，又是统一的，我们不应当片面地强调某一个侧面而否定另一个侧面。在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。在这个制度下，人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己。”
    毛主席还说：“民主是集中指导下的民主，不是无政府状态。无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”
    无产阶级专政下的大民主，是毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线统帅下的大民主。我们在运用无产阶级专政下的大民主这个手段时，必须注意维护和加强无产阶级的集中，而绝不能削弱无产阶级的集中；必须用毛泽东思想来指导自己的一切行动，用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线来指导自己的实际斗争。只有这样，才能保证无产阶级专政下的大民主顺利进行。如果把大民主当作目的，而反对无产阶级的集中，那就是无政府主义。无政府主义实质上就是资产阶级的民主，就是资产阶级的自由化。对于这种很错误的倾向，必须及时克服。
    无产阶级专政下的大民主，必须和自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律结合起来。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们运用无产阶级专政下的大民主这个手段，要打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派贩卖的奴隶主义，粉碎他们压制人民的资产阶级的反动纪律。打倒这些东西，正是为了加强无产阶级的革命纪律。因此，我们在使用无产阶级专政下的大民主的时候，必须坚决维护和切实遵守无产阶级的革命纪律。应该象毛主席教导我们的那样，在“享受着广泛的民主和自由”的时候，“同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己”。
    要正确地认识和运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，最根本的办法，就是要努力活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，破私立公，促进思想革命化。只有这样，才能紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
