Tokyo, June 1 (Xinhua) - The Japan International Trade Promotion Association issued a statement on May 31 strongly protesting the Japanese Sato government's unreasonable restrictions on a batch of exhibits to be sent to China.

The statement pointed out that the Sato government's destructive actions are in concert with U.S. imperialism's policy of expanding the war in Vietnam and hostility towards China. The Japanese people will resolutely fight against the Sato government's destructive actions.

The statement said that due to the Sato government's destructive activities, the originally scheduled June 1 Japanese Science Instrument Exhibition in Tianjin had to be postponed. The Japan International Trade Promotion Association will launch a protest movement starting June 2.

Tokyo, May 31 (Xinhua) - The Japanese Sato government, following the bankrupt "embargo" policy of U.S. imperialism, unreasonably restricted a batch of exhibits to be sent to China, obstructing the Japanese Science Instrument Exhibition scheduled for June 1 in Tianjin.

The Japanese Science Instrument Exhibition is the largest specialized exhibition to be held in China by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, aimed at further promoting economic and trade exchanges between the two countries and the friendly cause of the two peoples.

On April 18, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of the Sato government arbitrarily decided to prohibit 17 items from being exhibited in China. On May 17, Minister of International Trade and Industry Kaneno Wataro, in response to a question from Socialist Party member Ishino Hisao in the Japanese Diet's Commerce and Industry Committee, revealed his servile attitude towards the U.S., claiming that these 17 items have "high strategic value" and are therefore "inappropriate" for exhibition.

The Sato government's unreasonable decision has provoked great anger and resolute opposition from Japanese economic circles' friendly figures, who demand that the Sato government immediately revoke this decision.

On May 24, 260 representatives of companies engaged in Japan-China friendly trade held an emergency meeting to protest the Japanese government's obstruction and interference with the exhibition. They condemned the Sato government for using the "embargo regulations" as an excuse to prohibit the exhibition of these 17 items. They unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely fight against the Sato government's obstruction and interference.

The meeting passed a statement pointing out that the Sato government's measures this time are "its further tightening of the policy of hostility towards China, more closely following and assisting U.S. imperialism in invading Vietnam and 'containing' China."

The statement also made three demands to the Sato government: first, immediately revoke the restrictions on exhibits for the Japanese Science Instrument Exhibition in Tianjin. Second, eliminate U.S. interference in (Japan's) domestic affairs and fully revoke the "embargo regulations." Third, (the Sato government) stop the policy of hostility towards China and stop all obstruction and interference with Japan-China friendship and trade exchanges.

On May 26, Hagiwara Teiji, Executive Director of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and leader of the Japanese Science Instrument Exhibition delegation, told a Chinese reporter that the Sato government's obstruction and sabotage of the exhibition's timely holding shows that the Sato government is willing to be a henchman of U.S. imperialism, which is being beaten black and blue by the Vietnamese people. Hagiwara firmly stated that the broad friendly figures in the Japanese economic circles will resolutely fight to the end against the Japanese reactionary government that follows U.S. imperialism.

The revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party have played a shameful role in this exhibition's preparatory process, collaborating with U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. In the early stages of the preparatory work, the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party made every effort to obstruct and sabotage the holding of this exhibition. However, their anti-China actions were met with resolute opposition from the broad majority of Japanese economic circles who uphold justice, foiling their plots. It is revealed that the Japanese reactionary government's arbitrary decision this time is inseparable from the mischief-making of the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party. This exposes the fact that the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party are in cahoots with imperialism, revisionism, and reaction.

    日经济界友好人士愤怒抗议佐藤政府阻挠在华举行仪器展览会
    日本人民决不允许佐藤政府追随美帝反华
    日共修正主义分子竭力配合美日反动派破坏展览会筹备工作
    新华社一日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会五月三十一日发表声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤政府无理限制一批展品到中国展出。
    声明指出，佐藤政府的这一破坏行为，是同美帝国主义扩大侵越战争和敌视中国的政策互相配合的。日本人民将同佐藤政府的破坏行为进行坚决的斗争。
    声明说，由于佐藤政府的破坏活动，原订六月一日在天津举行的日本科学仪器展览会不得不延期。日本国际贸易促进协会将从六月二日起展开抗议运动。
    据新华社东京三十一日电　日本佐藤政府追随美帝国主义早已破产的“禁运”政策，竟然无理限制一批展品到中国展出，阻挠日本科学仪器展览会在六月一日在天津市举行。
    日本科学仪器展览会是日本国际贸易促进协会将在中国举行的规模最大的一次专业性展览会，其目的是为了进一步促进中日民间的经济贸易交流和两国人民的友好事业。
    今年四月十八日，佐藤政府的通商产业省，悍然决定日本科学仪器展览会的展品中有十七种禁止到中国展出。五月十七日，通商产业大臣菅野和太郎在日本国会商工委员会上答复社会党议员石野久男的质询时，露出一副美国奴才相，宣称这十七种展品的“战略价值高”，“因此展出是不适当的。”
    佐藤政府的这一无理决定激起了日本经济界友好人士的极大愤怒和坚决反对，并且要求佐藤政府立即撤销这个决定。
    五月二十四日，从事日中友好贸易的厂商代表二百六十人举行反对日本政府阻挠和干涉展览会的紧急集会，谴责佐藤政府借口“禁运条例”，禁止这十七种展品的展出。他们一致表示决心同佐藤政府的阻挠和干涉进行坚决的斗争。
    会议通过的一项声明指出，佐藤政府这次采取的措施是“它进一步加紧推行敌视中国的政策，更加追随和帮助美帝国主义侵略越南和‘遏制’中国”。
    声明还向佐藤政府提出三项要求：一、立即撤销对在天津举办的日本科学仪器展览会展出展品的限制。二、排除美国对（日本）内政的干涉，全面撤销“禁运条例”。三、（佐藤政府）停止敌视中国的政策，停止对日中友好和两国贸易往来的一切阻挠和干涉。
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事、日本科学仪器展览团团长萩原定司二十六日对中国记者发表谈话指出，佐藤政府阻挠和破坏展览会如期举行，表明佐藤政府甘心充当被越南人民打得焦头烂额的美帝国主义的侵略帮凶。萩原坚定地表示，日本经济界的广大友好人士将坚决同追随美帝国主义的日本反动政府斗争到底。
    日共修正主义分子在这次展览会的筹备过程中配合美帝国主义和日本反动派扮演了可耻的角色。在筹备工作的初期，日共修正主义分子极力进行阻挠，企图破坏这次展览会的举行。但是，他们的反华行径遭到了主持正义的日本经济界广大人士的坚决反对，使他们的阴谋未能得逞。据透露，这次日本反动政府悍然做出上述无理决定，是同日共修正主义分子从中捣鬼分不开的。这就暴露了日共修正主义分子与帝修反是一丘之貉。
