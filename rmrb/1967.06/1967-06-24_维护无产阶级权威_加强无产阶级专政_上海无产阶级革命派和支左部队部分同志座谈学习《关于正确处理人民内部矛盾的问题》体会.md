To commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," some comrades from the proletarian revolutionary factions and the left-supporting troops in Shanghai held a symposium to share their experiences in studying this epoch-making document. They linked the current struggles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, focusing on discussions about democracy and dictatorship, democracy and centralization, and opposing anarchism. They believed that the correct resolution of these issues is of great significance in further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and promoting revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination." Below are summaries of the speeches from these comrades.

"Sometimes, democracy appears to be the goal, but in reality, it is merely a means."

Peng Ziqiang, deputy director of the Shanghai Heterogeneous Steel Pipe Factory Revolutionary Committee, said: In our socialist country, the working class and the broad masses of laborers have always enjoyed extensive democracy. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have enjoyed even greater democracy through the "four bigs": big debate, big criticism, big character posters, and big speeches. This is the broadest democracy that no bourgeois country in the world can match, and it is a democracy that modern revisionist cliques cannot have.

When the revolutionary factions further utilize proletarian democracy, they must not forget Chairman Mao's teachings: "Democracy, sometimes it seems to be the goal, but in reality, it is merely a means." In capitalist society, the so-called democracy of the bourgeoisie is merely a means to maintain bourgeois dictatorship. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries use great democracy to mobilize the masses, unite all possible forces, overthrow the capitalist-roaders within the party, and strengthen our proletarian dictatorship.

In the people's internal affairs, democracy and dictatorship are complementary. Without extensive democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively implement dictatorship over the reactionaries. Without effective dictatorship over the reactionaries, it is also impossible to guarantee the people's democracy. Therefore, whether it is within the people to promote democracy or to implement dictatorship over the reactionaries, it is all for strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and consolidating the proletarian regime. When we use democracy as a means, we must not deviate from the goal of strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. Otherwise, we will fall into the path of "extreme democratization" and bourgeois liberalization.

Chen Jinquan, responsible person for the editorial department of "Red East" at Tongji University, said: In the past, some parts of our proletarian dictatorship organs were usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. We implement great democracy to break their white terror, to destroy the old order that serves them, to make their reactionary rule chaotic, and to expose them. Such great democracy is very good; it plays a role in eliminating the roots that harm the dictatorship of the proletariat and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. This approach is completely correct and necessary.

Now, in areas and units where the proletarian revolutionaries have taken power, the situation has fundamentally changed. We continue to implement great democracy, on the one hand, to thoroughly criticize and fight against the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, to eliminate their influence, and on the other hand, to establish and consolidate the new revolutionary order. The purpose is to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this new situation, if we still talk about "great chaos," it is not chaos for the enemy but chaos for ourselves. This is very unfavorable for establishing and consolidating the new revolutionary order.

If there are differences of opinion among revolutionary organizations, even if they are fundamental differences, they can be resolved according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." If we fight internal wars and engage in armed struggles because of this, it will only weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must not do things that hurt our own people and please our enemies.

"Within the people, there must be freedom, but there must also be discipline; there must be democracy, but there must also be centralization."

Bao Ziba, deputy director of the Shanghai Ink Factory Revolutionary Committee, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the people, we practice democratic centralism." The proletarian revolutionaries who have taken power must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. After we seized power, for a period, we did not handle the relationship between democracy and centralization well. Many tasks were often decided by a few comrades in leadership positions, and then executed by the lower levels. We considered centralization more and promoted democracy less. This way, not only did the work not go well, but the masses also had complaints. Later, our revolutionary committee repeatedly studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and we realized: without democracy, there is no correct centralization. Therefore, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, for major issues, we first fully promote democracy, consult with the masses, and then concentrate their opinions and implement them. The work then proceeded more smoothly.

According to Chairman Mao's teachings on solving internal people's problems "not by coercive methods but by democratic methods," we adopt democratic methods for comrades who hold different opinions, whether they are revolutionary factions or masses who have participated in conservative organizations, and let them speak. We also invite them to attend symposiums and listen to their opinions with humility. We check and correct our mistakes actively and promptly. This way, we not only unite the revolutionary faction fighters closely around the revolutionary committee but also unite the comrades who have participated in conservative organizations. This greatly mobilizes the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses and effectively promotes the revolutionary criticism, struggle, and transformation.

Ma Boyang, political department organization section chief of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison and the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Shanghai Coking Plant, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the people, democracy is relative to centralization, freedom is relative to discipline. These are two contradictory aspects of a unified whole, they are contradictory, and they are also unified. We should not emphasize one aspect while negating the other." Since we enjoy extensive democracy and freedom, we must consciously use proletarian revolutionary discipline to restrain ourselves.

The revolutionary committees established on the basis of the great alliance of the revolutionary factions are our proletarian power organs. We must establish their authority and maintain their prestige. For the correct decisions of the revolutionary committees, we must strictly follow and implement them. For their shortcomings, we must also help to overcome them in a friendly manner. This is not slavishness. This is a revolutionary need. Slavishness advocates blind obedience, and we must oppose it; anarchism opposes all organizational discipline, and we must also resolutely oppose it. We must not use anarchism to oppose slavishness, going from one extreme to another. True proletarian revolutionaries take Mao Zedong Thought as their action guideline and must not deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought to engage in "extreme democratization" and bourgeois liberalization.

"Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people."

Zheng Geming, deputy director of the Cultural Revolution Committee of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School, said: The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, in order to implement bourgeois dictatorship and sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, have always tried to use the spiritual shackles of slavishness to bind cadres and the masses; when they are about to fall, they spread the black wind of anarchism. This wind blows into the revolutionary ranks, and some comrades are also influenced. Some people only want freedom and do not want discipline, even saying: "I do whatever I want, no one can control me." Some people engage in factionalism and small-groupism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: In the people's internal affairs, we implement the democratic system, the people have extensive freedom and democratic rights, "but this freedom is led freedom, this democracy is democracy under centralized guidance, not anarchism. Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people." It is clear that if anarchist thoughts are not overcome, if everyone does not maintain the revolutionary authority of the proletariat and does not observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, if everyone does what they want, then the great alliance of the revolution, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" cannot be achieved, the great criticism, struggle, and transformation cannot be done well; democratic centralism will be difficult to implement, and the new revolutionary order will be difficult to consolidate. More seriously, the class enemies will take advantage of the situation, use anarchist thoughts to split and disintegrate our revolutionary ranks, and implement their counter-revolutionary restoration plots. In short, anarchism will inevitably weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat and hinder the smooth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Luo Meifang, responsible person for the Lu Xun Brigade of the Shanghai Sports Revolution Command, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must resolutely overcome the certain undisciplined or anarchic states that exist in many places." What is the root cause of the current anarchic state of mind? Generally, there are two situations: one is the inability to distinguish between proletarian great democracy and bourgeois liberalization, and the inability to distinguish between proletarian revolutionary discipline and bourgeois slavishness; the other is mainly the "I" first, the "self" first. In short, they view problems with "I" as the center, supporting what suits their taste and not listening to anyone who does not. From these situations, to overcome anarchism, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, raise our awareness, and eliminate selfishness to establish public spirit.

The leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must take the lead in opposing anarchism, first actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and overcome anarchist thoughts in their own minds. Our brigade criticized anarchism for a period, with little effect. The reason was that the comrades in the service team did not take the lead in using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome anarchist thoughts in their own minds. Later, our service team held a democratic life meeting attended by brigade fighters. The service personnel conducted criticism and self-criticism at the meeting, checking their anarchist performances. The brigade fighters also raised some valuable opinions. Everyone had a deeper understanding of the harm of anarchism. Everyone realized that as long as Mao Zedong Thought is deeply rooted in everyone's mind, anarchism will have no place to hide. Now, from the service team to the entire brigade, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become more conscious, and the market for anarchism has greatly shrunk.

    维护无产阶级权威　加强无产阶级专政
    ——上海无产阶级革命派和支左部队部分同志座谈学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》体会
    为了纪念毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表十周年，上海市工厂、学校的无产阶级革命派和支左部队的部分同志举行座谈会，畅谈学习这篇具有划时代意义的文献的体会。他们联系当前无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实际，着重讨论了民主和专政、民主和集中、反对无政府主义等问题。他们认为，这些问题的正确解决，对于进一步加强无产阶级专政，促进革命的大联合和“三结合”，具有重大的意义。下面是这些同志的发言摘要。
      “民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。”
    上海异型钢管厂革命委员会副主任彭自强说：在我们社会主义国家里，工人阶级和广大劳动人民一向享有广泛的民主，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，又享有大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论这样的大民主。这是世界上任何资产阶级国家所没有的最广泛的民主，也是现代修正主义集团统治的国家不可能有的民主。
    当革命派进一步运用无产阶级民主的时候，绝不能忘记毛主席的教导：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。”在资本主义社会，资产阶级的所谓民主，不过是维护资产阶级专政的一种手段。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派运用大民主，目的是要放手发动群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以便加强我们的无产阶级专政。
    在人民内部实行民主，对反动派实行专政，二者是相辅相成的。没有广泛的民主，不把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动派实行有效的专政。没有对反动派的有效的专政，也就不能保证人民的民主。因此，无论是在人民内部发扬民主，还是对反动派实行专政，都是为了加强无产阶级专政，巩固无产阶级政权。我们在运用民主这个手段的时候，不能离开加强无产阶级专政的目的。否则，就会走到“极端民主化”和资产阶级自由化的邪路上去。
    同济大学《东方红》报编辑部负责人陈金泉说：过去，我们的无产阶级专政机构，有某些部分被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺了。我们实行大民主，就是为了打破他们的白色恐怖，就是为了破坏为他们服务的旧秩序，把他们的反动统治搞得大乱特乱，把他们揪出来示众。这样的大民主好得很，它起了铲除危害无产阶级专政的祸根，巩固无产阶级专政的作用。这种做法是完全正确的、必要的。
    现在，在无产阶级革命派已经掌了权的地区和单位，情况已经发生了根本变化。我们继续实行大民主，一方面是为了彻底对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行展开批判斗争，清除他们的流毒，另一方面是为了建立和巩固革命的新秩序。目的都是为了进一步加强无产阶级专政。在这种新情况下，如果还提什么“大乱特乱”，那就不是乱敌人，而是乱自己了。这对建立和巩固革命的新秩序是非常不利的。
    革命组织之间有什么意见分歧，那怕是原则性的分歧，完全可以按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式加以解决。如果因此大打“内战”，大搞武斗，那就只会削弱无产阶级专政。我们绝不能做这种亲者痛、仇者快的事情。
    “在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。”
    上海油墨厂革命委员会副主任鲍自保说：毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部是实行民主集中制。”已经掌了权的无产阶级革命派，一定要按照毛主席的教导办事。我们夺权以后，开始一段时期对民主和集中的关系处理得不够好。许多工作，往往只是几个做领导工作的同志研究个意见，就让下面去执行。考虑集中多，发扬民主少。这样做，不但工作搞不好，而且群众有意见。后来我们革委会反复学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，才认识到：没有民主，就没有正确的集中。因此，我们遵照毛主席的教导，凡是重大问题首先充分发扬民主，和群众商量，然后把群众的意见集中起来，贯彻下去，工作就开展得比较顺利了。
    按照毛主席关于解决人民内部的问题“不是用强迫的方法，而是用民主的方法”的教导，我们对于持有不同意见的同志，不管他们是革命派还是参加过保守组织的群众，都采取民主的方法、让他们说话的方法。我们还把他们请来开座谈会，虚心听取他们的意见。我们有错误就主动检查，及时改正。这样，我们不但把革命派战士紧密地团结在革委会周围，也把过去参加过保守组织的同志团结起来了。这就大大调动了广大群众的积极性和创造性，有力地开展了革命的大批判和斗批改。
    上海警备区某部政治部组织科长、上海焦化厂毛泽东思想宣传组组长马伯良说：毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部，民主是对集中而言，自由是对纪律而言。这些都是一个统一体的两个矛盾着的侧面，它们是矛盾的，又是统一的，我们不应当片面地强调某一个侧面而否定另一个侧面。”我们既然享受着广泛的民主和自由，就要自觉地用无产阶级的革命纪律约束自己。
    在革命派大联合的基础上建立的“三结合”的革命委员会，是我们无产阶级的权力机构。我们要树立它的权威，维护它的威信。对于革命委员会正确的决定，必须严格遵守，坚决执行。对于它的缺点，也要善意地帮助克服。这绝不是奴隶主义。这是革命的需要。奴隶主义主张盲从，我们要反对；无政府主义反对一切组织纪律，我们同样要坚决反对。我们绝不能用无政府主义去反对奴隶主义，从一个极端走上另一个极端。真正的无产阶级革命派，是以毛泽东思想作为自己的行动指针，绝不能脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，去搞什么“极端民主化”和资产阶级自由化。
    “无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”
    上海市第六女中文化革命委员会副主任郑革命说：党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了推行资产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级专政，过去千方百计用奴隶主义的精神枷锁束缚干部和群众；当他们要垮台的时候，又大刮无政府主义的黑风。这股风吹到革命队伍当中，有些同志也受了影响。有的人只要自由，不要纪律，甚至说：“我爱干啥干啥，谁也管不着我。”有的人搞山头主义，闹小团体主义。
    毛主席教导我们：在人民内部实行民主制度，人民有广泛的自由和民主权利，“但是这个自由是有领导的自由，这个民主是集中指导下的民主，不是无政府状态。无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”很明显，如果无政府主义思想不克服，大家不维护无产阶级的革命权威，不遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，各行其是，那末，革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”就搞不起来，革命的大批判和斗批改就搞不好；民主集中制就难以贯彻，革命的新秩序就难以巩固。更严重的是，阶级敌人会钻空子，会利用无政府主义思想，分化、瓦解我们的革命队伍，实行他们反革命复辟的阴谋。总之，无政府主义必然削弱无产阶级专政，妨碍无产阶级文化大革命的顺利开展。
    上海体育战线革命造反司令部鲁迅兵团负责人罗美芳说：毛主席教导我们：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。目前产生无政府状态的思想根源究竟是怎样的呢？大致有两种情况：一种是分不清无产阶级大民主和资产阶级自由化的界限，分不清无产阶级革命纪律和资产阶级奴隶主义的界限；另一种主要是“我”字当头，“私”字作怪。总之，他们看问题以“我”为中心，符合我的口味就拥护，不符合的，谁讲了也不听。从这些情况看来，要克服无政府主义，就得活学活用毛主席著作，提高认识，破私立公。
    革命群众组织的负责人在反对无政府主义方面要起带头作用，要首先活学活用毛主席著作，克服自己头脑中的无政府主义。我们兵团前一段时间批判无政府主义，成效不大。原因是勤务组的同志没有带头用毛泽东思想克服自己头脑里的无政府主义思想。后来，我们勤务组召开了有兵团战士参加的民主生活会。勤务员在会上开展了批评和自我批评，检查了自己的无政府主义表现。兵团战士也提了一些宝贵意见。大家对无政府主义的危害性有了更深刻的认识。大家认识到，只要毛泽东思想在每个人的头脑里深深扎了根，无政府主义就没有藏身之地。现在，从勤务组到整个兵团，活学活用毛主席著作更加自觉，无政府主义的市场大大缩小了。　本报记者
