The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in Shanghai, who are carrying out support tasks at the Shanghai Pioneer Electric Machine Factory, enthusiastically helped the proletarian revolutionary forces to grasp Mao Zedong Thought and establish the worldview that "the proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all of humanity."

Under the guidance of the army comrades, the proletarian revolutionary forces at the Pioneer Electric Machine Factory used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to handle the relationships among various revolutionary organizations, between revolutionary forces and conservative organizations, and between revolutionary masses and cadres. They firmly united the broadest revolutionary masses and cadres, achieving revolutionary unity by workshop and department. They closely linked the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, making the entire factory bustling with revolutionary fervor. The revolutionary workers and cadres launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolution promoted production, and the first quarter's production plan was completed ahead of schedule in terms of quality, quantity, and overfulfillment. In April and May, the plan was also completed ahead of schedule.

Previously, the proletarian revolutionary forces in the factory had mental barriers against those who had participated in conservative organizations and opposed them. Some who had participated in conservative organizations, deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, also had grievances against the revolutionary forces. The soldiers first helped the proletarian revolutionary forces analyze the causes of the estrangement among the masses. After discussions, everyone came to a common understanding: the estrangement among the masses stemmed from the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the top capitalist-roader within the Party. The proletarian revolutionary forces, in order to unite the broad masses, must help those temporarily deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line to see through the evil face of the top capitalist-roader within the Party and understand the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line, and rise up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

With the help of the army, the revolutionary forces organized a series of activities. They joined the old workers who had suffered under the oppression of landlords and capitalists in the old society to recall the bitterness of the old society, the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the sweetness of socialism and Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary forces also, following Mao Zedong's teachings on "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades," studied the "Three Articles" and Mao Zedong's teachings on the two-line struggle with those who had been deceived. They held discussions on their experiences of rising up in rebellion, helping them to understand the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line and encouraging them to bravely join the revolutionary criticism struggle. They stood up one after another, with deep class hatred, and joined the revolutionary forces to launch a fierce attack on the top capitalist-roader within the Party.

Mao Zedong said, "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, the proletarian revolutionary forces at the Pioneer Electric Machine Factory seriously studied Mao Zedong's teachings, comprehensively analyzed the situation of the factory's cadres, and realized that due to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party implementing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," most of the good and relatively good cadres were struck down, suppressed, and persecuted. The revolutionary forces, in order to carry out the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, should firmly protect the majority of good and relatively good cadres; for those who have made mistakes but are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, they should, through criticism and education, warmly help them to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and concentrate their efforts on striking down the "handful."

With the help of the army soldiers, the proletarian revolutionary forces established a special cadre work group, concentrating three weeks to study Mao Zedong's works with the cadres, organizing them to "come out" to the masses, holding bitterness-sweetness meetings, arousing the proletarian feelings of these cadres, and standing on Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionary forces also placed some cadres who had made mistakes in places with sharp contradictions, letting the cadres participate in the criticism struggle with the masses, engage in production together, correct mistakes in actual struggles, accept the masses' verification, and let the masses know more about the cadres, creating conditions for the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The proletarian revolutionary forces, in order to establish the worldview of "liberating all of humanity," must fundamentally raise their class consciousness and correctly treat themselves, daring to revolutionize themselves. After seizing power, this factory's proletarian revolutionary forces had actively opened the door for rectification, listening to the opinions of the broad masses. However, they had not made sufficient mental preparations to listen to the masses' opinions, so during the first and second rectifications, some people could not accept the opinions raised by the masses, thinking they were not supported, and refuted them one by one. As a result, during the third rectification, the masses no longer raised opinions.

At this time, the People's Liberation Army soldiers brought Mao Zedong Thought to the proletarian revolutionary forces, organizing them to study and apply Mao Zedong's works actively. They also, with deep class feelings, pointed out to them: after seizing power, one must not be busy with affairs and neglect study, but must always highlight Mao Zedong Thought and timely raise the spirit of revolutionary rebellion to a new level.

Not only should one dare to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, but also dare to rebel against the "self" in one's mind.

The army soldiers worked and rested with the proletarian revolutionary warriors, exchanging experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong's works. They repeatedly studied Mao Zedong's "Three Articles" and the brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas." The army soldiers took the lead in exposing their thoughts and fighting against selfishness, setting an example of studying and applying Mao Zedong's works actively. The proletarian revolutionary warriors also inspected various non-proletarian thoughts in their ranks.

Mao Zedong Thought broadened the horizons of the proletarian revolutionary forces, making them stand higher and see farther. The leaders of the revolutionary organizations went deep into the workshops and teams, actively inspected their shortcomings, and sincerely sought opinions from the veteran workers. The revolutionary organizations also held open rectification meetings in the workshops, specially convening various discussion meetings, mobilizing the masses to raise opinions. The revolutionary forces, with the attitude of "no crime for speaking, sufficient warning for listening," "correcting if there is, encouraging if there is none," seriously recorded every opinion and published the discussion minutes throughout the factory. The revolutionary leaders also broadly listened to opinions and wrote self-inspections. After the rectification, the proletarian revolutionary forces gained higher prestige and stronger combat effectiveness among the masses.

    用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派
    听毛主席的话正确对待干部和群众
    解放军指战员帮助上海先锋电机厂在大批判中实现了按车间按部门大联合
    据新华社上海八日电　中国人民解放军驻沪部队某部在上海先锋电机厂执行支工任务的指战员，热情帮助无产阶级革命派掌握毛泽东思想，树立“无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己”的世界观。
    在部队同志的帮助下，先锋电机厂的无产阶级革命派以毛泽东思想为武器，来处理各革命组织之间的关系，处理革命派和保守组织之间的关系，处理革命群众和干部之间的关系，坚决团结最广大的革命群众和革命干部，实现了按车间、按部门的革命的大联合，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，使全厂呈现出一派热气腾腾的革命景象。广大革命职工和革命干部向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。革命促进了生产，第一季度按质、按量、超额完成了国家计划，四、五月份又全面提前完成了计划。
    原先，这个厂的无产阶级革命派对参加过保守组织并反对过自己的群众，在思想上总是有疙瘩；有些参加过保守组织的群众，由于受资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，对革命派同志也有意见。指战员们首先帮助无产阶级革命派分析群众之间产生隔阂的原因。经过讨论，大家共同认识到：群众中的隔阂是来自党内头号走资本主义道路当权派推行的资产阶级反动路线。无产阶级革命派要团结广大群众，就要帮助那些暂时受了资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同志认清党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶面目，看清资产阶级反动路线的本质，起来批判资产阶级反动路线。
    在解放军帮助下，革命派进行了一系列活动，与那些在旧社会饱受地主、资本家剥削压迫的老工人一起，共忆旧社会之苦，忆资产阶级反动路线之苦，同思社会主义之甜，思毛主席的无产阶级革命路线之甜。革命派还按照毛主席关于“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的教导，与受过蒙蔽的群众一起学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于两条路线斗争的教导，跟他们座谈自己起来造反的体会，帮助他们认清资产阶级反动路线的实质，促使他们勇敢地站起来投入革命的大批判斗争。他们纷纷站出来，以满腔的阶级仇恨，和革命派一起，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”先锋电机厂的无产阶级革命派在解放军指战员的帮助下，认真学习了毛主席的教导，全面分析了工厂干部的状况，认识到由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派执行了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，使大部分好的和比较好的干部受到了打击、压制和迫害。革命派要实行革命的“三结合”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就应该对大多数好的和比较好的干部，坚决保护；对犯过错误但还不是反党反社会主义分子的干部，则通过批判、教育，热情帮助他们同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，集中力量狠狠打击“一小撮”。
    在解放军指战员的帮助下，无产阶级革命派组织专门成立了干部工作小组，集中三周时间与干部一起学习毛主席著作，组织他们到群众中去“亮相”，召开忆苦思甜会，激发这些干部的无产阶级感情，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。无产阶级革命派还把一些犯有错误的干部放到矛盾尖锐的地方，让干部在火热的群众斗争中与群众一起参加大批判，一起搞生产，在实际斗争中改正错误，接受群众检验，让群众更多地了解干部，为实现革命的“三结合”创造条件。
    无产阶级革命派要树立“解放全人类”的世界观，团结一切可以团结的力量，必须从根本上提高阶级觉悟，正确对待自己，勇于革自己的命。这个工厂的无产阶级革命派夺权以后，曾经主动开门整风，听取广大群众的意见。但是，当时并没有作好充分的思想准备来听取群众的意见，因此革命派组织在第一、第二两次开门整风时，有些人对群众提出的意见听不进去，认为是对自己不支持，给一条条驳了回去。结果，革命派组织在第三次开门整风时，群众不提意见了。
    就在这时，人民解放军指战员给无产阶级革命派送来了毛泽东思想，组织他们活学活用毛主席著作，同时以深厚的阶级感情向他们指出：掌权以后，决不能忙于事务，放松学习，必须时时突出毛泽东思想，及时把革命造反精神提高到新水平。
    不仅要敢于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，也要勇于造自己头脑中“私”字的反。
    解放军指战员同无产阶级革命战士劳动在一起，休息在一起，相互交流活学活用毛主席著作的体会。他们一起反复学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作。解放军指战员带头亮思想，斗私心，作出了活学活用毛主席著作的榜样。无产阶级革命派的战士也纷纷检查了自己队伍中形形色色的非无产阶级思想。
    毛泽东思想使无产阶级革命派胸怀开阔，站得高了，看得远了。革命派组织的各级负责人，深入车间、班组，向老师傅们主动检查缺点，诚恳征求意见。革命派组织还在车间开门整风，专门召集各种座谈会，发动群众提意见。革命派则本着“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”的态度，认真记下每一条意见，并且把座谈纪要公布全厂。革命派负责人还广泛听取意见，写出了检查。经过整风，无产阶级革命派在群众中威信更高，战斗力更强了。
