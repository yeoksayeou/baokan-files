The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, combining the revolutionary great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the plant, and has launched a new high tide of revolution and production.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan on the 2nd, after the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant took power, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely combined the revolutionary great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the plant, united the majority of the masses and cadres, vigorously promoted the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving revolutionary great alliance and "three-in-one combination," launching a new high tide of production, and achieving dual victories in revolution and production.

The plant implemented the great alliance by administrative departments in mid-March and established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ in early April. However, due to the lingering influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, the proletarian revolutionary faction, after taking power, still faced a series of problems. For example, the deceived masses had not yet completely stood on Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and although they had united with the revolutionary faction in organization, their thoughts had not yet united; cadres who had made mistakes had not yet been completely liberated from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line and had various concerns, hesitating to stand up for the revolution. This situation affected the consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and hindered the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and reform. At this time, a handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road colluded with ghosts and snakes, stirring up trouble, attempting to seize the opportunity to launch a counter-revolutionary restoration tide, and sabotage the revolutionary great alliance and "three-in-one combination."

Comrade Chen Boda's article "Patriotism or Treason?" and relevant editorials and articles in the "Red Flag" magazine sounded the bugle for launching a general offensive against the number one power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line he represented. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant realized that this was the current greatest political task. They closely combined it with the actual class struggle of the plant and immediately launched a mass revolutionary great criticism movement throughout the plant. They took the theme "Who is the culprit who sabotaged the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination'?" to expose and criticize. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres unanimously recognized that the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road in the plant vigorously promoted the bourgeois reactionary line thrown out by the number one power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road, labeling a large number of revolutionary workers as "counter-revolutionaries," pushing all middle-level cadres to the "stage" for encirclement and struggle, and creating serious estrangement and opposition between revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres. The number one power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the plant are the root cause of sabotaging the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and are the mortal enemies of the proletariat. This aroused the indignation of the broad revolutionary faction, and at the same time, educated the deceived masses and cadres who had made mistakes. They unanimously expressed: We, the working class, should put the overall situation first and hold the revolution close to heart, unite together, overthrow the number one power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road, and cut off his black hand stretching towards the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant. Under such circumstances, the proletarian revolutionary faction throughout the plant launched a high tide of exposing, denouncing, and criticizing "Cultivation of the Self" and the bourgeois reactionary line, and further did ideological work for the deceived masses and cadres who had made mistakes. At a criticism meeting, a cadre who had made mistakes angrily said: I have read "Cultivation of the Self" for several years. According to the number one power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road, I regarded my superiors as the embodiment of the party, regardless of right and wrong, and followed their orders unconditionally. As a result, under the command of the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, I became a tool for promoting the bourgeois reactionary line and struck at revolutionary comrades. I will definitely hold high Mao Zedong's banner of "Rebellion is justified" and rebel against "Cultivation of the Self" and the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road! The exposure, denunciation, and criticism of revolutionary workers and cadres had a great educational effect on the deceived masses and cadres who had made mistakes. They further recognized the tricks of the number one power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road, further recognized the evil of the bourgeois reactionary line, and further recognized the reactionary face of the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road in the plant. Therefore, they all fiercely turned back and approached the revolutionary faction. Now, the majority of the cadres in the plant have stood up for the revolution, and 50% of the cadres, after being examined by the masses, have been selected into the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cadre teams at various levels within the plant. All 26 workshops and units in the plant have established revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cadre teams, under the unified leadership of the plant revolutionary committee, fully utilizing proletarian authority, and launching a new high tide of "grasp the revolution and promote production."

    以大局为重　以革命为怀　实行革命大联合
    集中力量打击主要敌人
    长治钢铁厂无产阶级革命派牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把革命的大批判同本厂的斗批改结合起来，掀起了革命和生产新高潮
    据新华社太原二日电  长治钢铁厂无产阶级革命派掌权后，在人民解放军的大力支援下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把革命的大批判同本厂的斗批改紧密结合起来，团结群众和干部的大多数，狠抓革命，猛促生产，实现了革命的大联合和“三结合”，掀起了生产新高潮，取得了革命、生产双胜利。
    这个厂在三月中旬按行政部门实行了大联合，于四月初建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。但是由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒没有彻底肃清，无产阶级革命派掌权后，仍然面临着一系列的问题。例如，受蒙蔽的群众还没有完全站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，他们同革命派虽然在组织上联合起来了，但思想上还没有联合；犯过错误的干部还没有从资产阶级反动路线的束缚下彻底解放出来，有这样那样的顾虑，迟迟不敢起来革命。这种情况影响着革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的巩固，影响着斗批改的深入进行。而在这时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派勾结牛鬼蛇神，蠢蠢欲动，企图趁机掀起反革命复辟逆流，破坏革命的大联合和“三结合”。
    戚本禹同志的文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》和《红旗》杂志的有关社论、文章，吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的进军号。长治钢铁厂的无产阶级革命派认识到，这是当前最大的政治任务。他们紧紧结合本厂阶级斗争的实际，立即在全厂掀起了一个群众性的革命的大批判运动。他们以“谁是破坏革命的大联合和革命的‘三结合’的罪魁祸首”为题，进行揭发、批判。广大革命工人和革命干部一致认识到，厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派竭力推行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派抛出来的资产阶级反动路线，把大批革命职工打成了“反革命”，把所有中层干部推上“楼”进行围攻和斗争，一手制造了革命职工之间、革命职工与革命干部之间的严重隔阂和对立。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和厂内一小撮反革命修正主义分子是破坏革命大联合和革命的“三结合”的祸根，是无产阶级的死敌。这就激起了广大革命派的怒火，同时也教育了受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部。他们一致表示：咱们工人阶级要以大局为怀，以革命为重，团结起来，打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，斩断他伸向长治钢铁厂的黑手。在这样的情况下，全厂无产阶级革命派掀起了对《修养》和资产阶级反动路线的大揭发、大控诉、大批判的高潮，并进一步对受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部做思想工作。在批判会上，一个犯错误的干部愤怒地说：我读了好几年《修养》，我照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的说法，把自己的上级看成是党的化身，不论是非，对他们唯命是从。结果，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的指挥棒下，作了推行资产阶级反动路线的工具，打击了革命同志。我一定高举毛主席的“造反有理”的大旗，大造《修养》的反，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反！革命职工和干部的揭发、控诉和批判，对受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部教育很大，他们更加认清了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋诡计，更加认清了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，更加认清了本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动面目，因此，纷纷狠杀回马枪，并向革命派靠拢。现在，这个厂大多数干部已经站起来革命，百分之五十的干部经过群众的审查，被选入了厂内各级革命的“三结合”的领导班子。全厂二十六个车间、单位都建立了革命的“三结合”的领导班子，在厂革命委员会的统一领导下，充分运用无产阶级权威，掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
