The eight red diplomats from our embassy in India, who bravely fought against the Indian reactionaries, have triumphantly returned to the capital of our great motherland, Beijing, and to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. We extend our warm greetings to the heroic red diplomats from the frontlines of the international class struggle and offer them our revolutionary salute in the spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The Chinese people are not to be trifled with! The five-star red flag is not to be trifled with! Our red diplomats, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fear neither sacrifice nor violence. They dare to resist the savage attacks of Indian fascist thugs with bare hands, and are willing to shed their blood and lives to defend the dignity of our great motherland and the glorious five-star red flag. They are truly the heroic sons and daughters of our great motherland and the good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The brave struggle of our red diplomats at the Chinese embassy in India is another triumphant chapter in the history of our diplomatic struggles, and a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary diplomatic line.

The diplomats of great socialist China are the diplomatic warriors of the proletariat. They strive to study Mao Zedong Thought at all times and in all places, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. With this powerful and formidable weapon of Mao Zedong Thought firmly in their hands, they possess an unyielding revolutionary spirit, a firm and correct political direction, an unshakable will to struggle, and the ability to fulfill their sacred duties of proletarian revolutionary diplomacy in any complex situation and under any perilous conditions.

The diplomacy of socialist countries, the revolutionary diplomacy of the proletariat, has its own unique and combative style. Our proletarian diplomacy must draw a clear line between itself and the corrupt diplomatic traditions of the bourgeoisie, and the petty, servile diplomatic style of modern revisionism that caters to and worships the bourgeoisie.

The diplomatic warriors of the proletariat uphold Chairman Mao's revolutionary diplomatic line and the revolutionary principles of the proletariat. They distinguish friends from enemies. Toward the revolutionary peoples and revolutionary countries, our diplomats, as our great leader Chairman Mao has taught, should be the most humble, the most respectful of others, and the most dedicated to the spirit of proletarian internationalism, firmly supporting their revolutionary struggles and eliminating all manifestations of great-power chauvinism. Toward imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, we must stand firmly against them and resolutely struggle against them. To the provocations of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, we must give a resolute response.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of who serves whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." This applies to diplomatic work as well. Our proletarian diplomats serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. We will not do anything that goes against the interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We will never trade principles or the interests of the people of various countries. In any situation, even in the face of the enemy's bayonets, our diplomats will unyieldingly uphold revolutionary principles, remain loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the socialist motherland, and loyal to proletarian internationalism. Toward the bourgeoisie, our diplomats will never engage in unprincipled flattery, sycophancy, or pandering; nor will they be swayed by the bourgeoisie's various sugar-coated bullets. This is the style of proletarian diplomacy.

In recent years, on the frontlines of international class struggle, batch after batch of outstanding red diplomats with a proletarian fighting spirit have emerged. They have fearlessly defended Mao Zedong Thought, the dignity of the motherland, the interests of the revolution, and proletarian internationalism. They have not feared the enemy's prisons and courts, nor the enemy's clubs and bayonets. They have displayed the spirit of proletarian backbone and shown the noble qualities of Chairman Mao's good soldiers. Their heroic actions have greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary peoples, greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and written a brilliant chapter in the history of international proletarian diplomatic struggles.

The Indian reactionaries have been rampantly anti-China, persecuting our diplomatic personnel, and once again exposed their ugly faces as lackeys of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique in front of the world's people. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries opposing us is our honor, proving that we are right and doing well. The broad masses of the Indian people want to be friends with China and will not allow the Indian reactionaries to continue their reckless behavior. The Indian reactionaries, who are die-hard tools of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, will not have a good end.

### 向坚持毛主席革命外交路线的红色战士致敬！

    向坚持毛主席革命外交路线的红色战士致敬！
    同印度反动派进行英勇斗争的我国驻印度大使馆八名红色外交战士，已经胜利地回到了伟大祖国的首都北京，回到了伟大领袖毛主席的身边。我们向来自国际阶级斗争前线的英雄的红色外交战士们表示亲切的慰问，致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
    中国人民不可侮！五星红旗不可侮！用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的我国红色外交战士，不怕牺牲，不畏强暴，敢于赤手空拳抵抗印度法西斯暴徒的野蛮袭击，不惜用鲜血和生命保卫我们伟大祖国的尊严，保卫光辉灿烂的五星红旗。他们不愧为伟大祖国的英雄儿女，不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    我国驻印度大使馆红色外交战士的英勇斗争，是我国外交斗争史上的又一曲响亮的凯歌，是毛主席革命外交路线的新的胜利。
    伟大的社会主义中国的外交人员，是无产阶级的外交战士。他们无论何时何地都努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想。他们把毛泽东思想这个威力无比的强大武器牢牢掌握在手里，就有了大无畏的革命精神，就有了坚定正确的政治方向，就有了无比坚强的斗争意志，就能够在各种复杂的情况下，在任何艰险的环境中，履行无产阶级革命外交的神圣的职责。
    社会主义国家的外交，无产阶级的革命的外交，具有自己独创的战斗的风格。我们无产阶级的外交，必须同资产阶级的那一套腐朽的外交传统，同现代修正主义的那一套迎合资产阶级、向资产阶级顶礼膜拜的市侩式的外交风格，彻底划清界限。
    无产阶级的外交战士，坚持毛主席的革命外交路线，坚持无产阶级的革命原则。他们分清谁是朋友，谁是敌人。对革命的人民、革命的国家，我们的外交战士，要象我们伟大的领袖毛主席所教诲的那样，最谦虚，最能够尊重别人，最能够发扬无产阶级国际主义的精神，坚决支持他们的革命斗争，根绝一切大国沙文主义的表现。而对于帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，我们则针锋相对地、坚决地同它们进行斗争。对于帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的挑衅，一定给予坚决的回击。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”外交工作同样有这个问题。我们的无产阶级外交战士是全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的。凡是违反中国人民和世界人民利益的事，我们就坚决不干。我们绝不拿原则作交易，绝不拿各国人民的利益作交易。在任何情况下，即使是在敌人的刺刀面前，我们的外交战士也毫不动摇地坚持革命的原则，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于社会主义祖国，忠于无产阶级国际主义。对于资产阶级，我们的外交战士绝不作无原则的捧场、阿谀和奉迎；也绝不受资产阶级形形色色糖衣炮弹的侵袭。这就是无产阶级外交的风格。
    几年来，在国际阶级斗争的战线上，不断地涌现出了一批又一批具有无产阶级战斗风格的优秀的红色外交战士。他们为了捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫祖国的尊严，捍卫革命的利益，捍卫无产阶级国际主义，不怕敌人的监狱和法庭，不怕敌人的警棍和刺刀，发扬了无产阶级的硬骨头精神，表现了毛主席的好战士的高贵品质。他们的英勇行动，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的“威风”，在国际无产阶级外交斗争史上写下了灿烂的篇章。
    印度反动派猖狂反华，迫害我国的外交人员，在全世界人民面前，又一次暴露了它作为美帝国主义和苏修集团反华走卒的丑恶嘴脸。帝国主义、修正主义和反动派反对我们，这是我们的光荣，证明我们做得对，做得好。广大的印度人民是要同中国友好的，他们绝不会允许印度反动派这样胡作非为下去。印度反动派死心塌地充当美帝和苏修的反华工具，是决不会有好下场的。（附图片）
