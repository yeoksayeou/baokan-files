	The Most Fundamental Preparation

	How to fight a good battle for the summer harvest? What preparations should be made at this moment? The members of the Sixth Brigade of Wujie Commune in Nantong, Jiangsu, began their first lesson in welcoming the summer harvest by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds first and foremost with Mao Zedong Thought. This lesson was well-taught! To fight a good battle for the summer harvest, one must certainly make all sorts of material preparations, but mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental preparation. Once Mao Zedong Thought is mastered, all work will have a direction, a motive force, and the greatest guarantee.

	This brigade, in the course of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, particularly emphasized the need for careful harvesting and threshing to prevent waste, thus seizing the key to the summer harvest. Only in this way can the crops grown in the fields be fully harvested and brought into the threshing floor, and the grains threshed on the floor be fully brought into the granary, truly ensuring that high-yield crops are turned into a bountiful harvest.

	This year's summer grain crops will yield a bumper harvest. It is essential to emphasize politics, mobilize the broad masses of commune members to harvest and thresh carefully, prevent waste, and achieve both high yield and high harvest. To do this, one must, like the Sixth Brigade of Wujie Commune in Nantong County, first arm oneself with Chairman Mao's thought of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people," and with Chairman Mao's policy of "practicing economy and opposing waste" to guide one's actions and ensure a good summer harvest.

    最根本的准备
    怎样打好夏收这一仗？眼前要作些什么准备？江苏南通五接公社六大队的社员们迎接夏收的第一课，是活学活用毛主席著作，首先用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。这一课上得好！打好夏收仗，固然要作好种种物质上的准备，但是掌握毛泽东思想却是最根本的准备。掌握了毛泽东思想，各项工作就有了方向，有了动力，有了最大的保证。
    这个大队在活学活用毛主席著作中，特别强调了要精收细打，防止浪费，这就抓住了夏收的关键。只有这样，才能把地里长的，全部收到场里，场里打的，全部收到仓里，才能真正保证把丰产的庄稼变成丰收的粮食。
    今年的夏粮作物将是一个大好的收成，一定要突出政治，发动广大社员精收细打，防止浪费，做到丰产丰收。而要做到这一点，就得象南通县五接公社六大队一样，首先用毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的思想，用毛主席的“厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针”武装自己，指导自己的行动，搞好夏收。
