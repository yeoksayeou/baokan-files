The Central Secretariat of the CPSL cabled the CC of the CPC to congratulate the success of China's hydrogen bomb explosion. The strengthening of China's nuclear power will accelerate the total collapse of imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 18 – D. S. Senanayake, member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPSL, on behalf of the Central Secretariat of the CPSL, cabled the Central Committee of the CPC on June 18 to warmly congratulate the success of China's hydrogen bomb explosion.

The full text of the cable is as follows:

We, on behalf of the Communist Party of Ceylon, extend our warm congratulations to the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and their beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong for the great victory of the hydrogen bomb explosion. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This victory greatly encourages all oppressed peoples struggling for liberation from the clutches of imperialism. The possession of advanced nuclear power by the People's Republic of China is a great force in the struggle for world peace, in checking the imperialists, especially American imperialism, from bullying, threatening, and invading the peoples of small and underdeveloped countries.

The strengthening of the nuclear power of the People's Republic of China further changes the balance of world forces in favor of maintaining true peace, in favor of the forces of people's democracy, national liberation, and socialism. We are convinced that the further strengthening of the nuclear power of the People's Republic of China will undoubtedly accelerate the disintegration and total collapse of world imperialism and will inspire the revolutionary peoples of the world to be more determined in their struggle for world revolution victory.

    锡共中央书记处致电中共中央祝贺我氢弹爆炸成功
    中国核力量的增强将加速帝国主义总崩溃
    新华社科伦坡十八日电　锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记狄·桑穆加塔桑，代表锡共中央书记处十八日打电报给中国共产党中央委员会，热烈祝贺中国氢弹爆炸成功。
    电报全文如下：
    我们代表锡兰共产党为中国氢弹爆炸的巨大胜利，向伟大中国人民、中国共产党和他们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席致敬。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这个胜利大大鼓舞了为争取从帝国主义势力下解放出来而斗争的一切被压迫人民。中华人民共和国拥有先进的核力量，是争取世界和平，遏制帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义对弱小的和不发达的国家的人民进行欺侮、威胁和侵略的巨大力量。
    中华人民共和国核力量的增强，进一步改变了世界力量的对比，而有利于维护真正的和平，有利于人民民主、民族解放和社会主义的力量。我们认为，毫无疑问，中华人民共和国核力量的进一步增强，将促使世界帝国主义进一步分崩离析而走向总崩溃；并将使全世界的革命人民坚定争取世界革命胜利的信心。
