Due to the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary people of China have risen up to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, criticized the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and in many places, seized power from them. They have established revolutionary committees according to the principle of "three-in-one combination," raising the level of this struggle to a new height.

    缅甸工人欢呼中国文化大革命胜利开展一周年
    毛泽东思想光辉照亮全世界
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸一些工人热情洋溢地说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，为国际共产主义运动作出了巨大贡献。
    六名缅甸工人最近在这里发表了他们合写的一篇文章，欢庆中国无产阶级文化大革命开展一周年。文章说，过去的一年，是对世界无产阶级革命和民族解放斗争具有伟大意义的一年。由于在中国开展无产阶级文化大革命，革命的中国人民起来造党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，批判了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在许多地方还从他们手里夺了权，并根据“三结合”的原则，建立了革命委员会，把这场斗争提到更高的水平。
    文章强调指出，中国在过去一年里发生的情况已向世界表明，如果不搞文化大革命，要建设社会主义，巩固和保卫社会主义并向共产主义过渡，是不可能的。
    文章指出：毛泽东思想在世界革命人民中间已经深入人心。世界革命人民争取社会主义和民族解放的斗争随着中国无产阶级文化大革命而蓬勃高涨，毛泽东思想的光芒已照亮世界的每一个角落。
