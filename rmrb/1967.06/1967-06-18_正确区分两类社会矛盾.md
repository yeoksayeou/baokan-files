Mao Zedong's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," published ten years ago, brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism's dialectical materialism and the theory of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. This brilliant work's major contribution to the international communist movement is that it, for the first time, provided the most profound, comprehensive, and correct analysis of the contradictions in socialist society. It proposed the great theory of correctly distinguishing and handling two types of contradictions of different natures, laying the theoretical foundation for continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

Over the past ten years, Mao Zedong, in his series of great works and directives, and in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "May 16 Circular" and "Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" which he personally presided over, further developed the theory of contradictions, class, and class struggle in socialist society. This further marked the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong analyzed the various complex social contradictions in the socialist period and pointed out: "Before us, there are two types of social contradictions: those between the enemy and us, and those among the people. These are two types of contradictions of completely different natures."

Throughout the entire historical stage of socialism, there is always the danger of capitalist restoration. The biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous figures attempting to restore capitalism. The contradiction between the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers and the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at concentrating all efforts to resolve this principal contradiction.

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, bad elements are only a tiny minority. They must be exposed, overthrown, and subjected to dictatorship.

At present, some comrades, while talking about focusing on the principal contradiction and grasping the direction of struggle, actually direct the spearhead of struggle at their comrades or the masses. They forget the real enemy, reverse the enemy-our relationship, and confuse the principal and secondary contradictions. This is very wrong.

To concentrate forces to strike at the principal enemy, we must correctly handle contradictions among the people, unite all forces that can be united, and achieve the broadest revolutionary great alliance with the leftists as the core.

Currently, contradictions among the people include contradictions among revolutionary masses, contradictions between revolutionary masses and those who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations, and contradictions between revolutionary masses and cadres who have made mistakes, and so on. These contradictions are fundamentally different in nature from those between the enemy and us. They are secondary contradictions, non-antagonistic contradictions, and contradictions based on fundamental common interests.

Using Mao Zedong's class analysis method to observe contradictions among the people, the majority are contradictions in the ideological and ideological realm. Of course, there are also ideological and ideological contradictions between the enemy and us, but these are fundamentally different from contradictions among the people.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads will inevitably be reflected among the people. It is particularly noteworthy that various petty-bourgeois ideologies, such as anarchism, individualism, subjectivism, cliquism, and sectarianism, are fundamentally opposed to the proletarian worldview. These petty-bourgeois ideologies often interfere with the proletarian revolutionary line, divert the direction of struggle, and harm the revolutionary great alliance.

We must be vigilant. The petty bourgeoisie will continue to produce new capitalists and bourgeoisie. The vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie is very serious. The overthrown landlord and bourgeoisie classes always try to use this vacillation to facilitate their counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

Every revolutionary comrade must be vigilant and not mistake petty-bourgeois thoughts and actions for proletarian revolutionary nature.

Mao Zedong teaches us: "All problems of an ideological nature and all problems of controversy among the people should be resolved by democratic methods, by the method of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not by coercive and dictatorial methods."

We must correctly apply the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to resolve contradictions among the people, achieve revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "triple combination," launch a great criticism and struggle against the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and successfully complete the tasks of struggle-criticism-transformation in our units.

### 正确区分两类社会矛盾

    正确区分两类社会矛盾
    毛主席在十年前发表的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部划时代的著作，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的唯物辩证法和阶级斗争、无产阶级专政的理论。这部光辉著作对国际共产主义事业的重大贡献在于，它第一次最深刻、最全面、最正确地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾，提出了正确区分和处理两类不同性质矛盾的伟大学说，为在无产阶级专政条件下还必须继续进行革命，奠定了理论基础。
    十年来，毛主席在他的一系列伟大著作和指示中，在他亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和八月八日《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》中，对于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，又作了巨大的发展。这进一步地标志着马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    毛主席分析了社会主义时期各种错综复杂的社会矛盾，指出：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”
    在社会主义的整个历史阶段，随时存在着资本主义复辟的危险。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就是企图实行资本主义复辟的最危险的人物。无产阶级和广大劳动人民，同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是主要矛盾，对抗性的矛盾。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要集中全力解决这个主要矛盾。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，坏人只是极少数，只是一小撮。对他们，就是要揭露，要打倒，要专政。
    目前，有些同志，讲的是抓住主要矛盾，掌握斗争大方向，实际上把斗争的矛头指向自己的战友或群众。他们忘记了真正的敌人，颠倒了敌我关系，混淆了主要矛盾和次要矛盾。这是很错误的。
    要集中力量打击最主要的敌人，就要正确处理人民内部的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合。
    当前，人民内部的矛盾，包括革命群众之间的矛盾，无产阶级革命派同受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众之间的矛盾，革命群众同犯错误的干部之间的矛盾，等等。这些矛盾，同敌我之间的矛盾有着根本性质的区别，是次要的矛盾，非对抗性的矛盾，是在根本利益一致的基础上的矛盾。
    运用毛主席的阶级分析方法来观察人民内部的矛盾，主要的大量的是思想方面、意识形态方面的矛盾。当然，敌我之间也存在着思想方面、意识形态方面的矛盾，但是，这同人民内部的矛盾是根本不相同的。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，两个阶级，两条道路，两条路线的斗争，必然要反映到人民内部来。特别值得注意的是，形形色色的小资产阶级的思潮，如无政府主义、个人主义、主观主义、小团体主义、山头主义，等等，同无产阶级世界观是根本对立的。这些小资产阶级思潮，常常会干扰无产阶级革命路线，转移斗争的大方向，危害革命的大联合。
    我们必须警惕，小资产阶级还会不断生长出新的资本主义和资产阶级。小资产阶级的摇摆性是很严重的。被推翻了的地主资产阶级，总是想通过这种摇摆性，为他们实行反革命复辟的活动，制造便利。
    每一个革命同志，都要警惕自己，不要把小资产阶级的思想和行动，当成无产阶级的革命性。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”
    我们必须正确运用“团结——批评——团结”的公式，解决人民内部矛盾，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判、大斗争，胜利地完成本单位斗批改的任务。
