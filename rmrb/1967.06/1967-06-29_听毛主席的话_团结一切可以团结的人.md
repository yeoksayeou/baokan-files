After seizing power, should we still unite the masses?

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionary factions in our factory united to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. After seizing power, the position of the revolutionary rebels changed, and some comrades thought: "We have the power in our hands now, so we can put off the work of uniting the masses for a while." Others said, "We have the power, who dares not listen to us? If someone opposes us, we will deal with them."

After the proletarian revolutionary factions seize power, should we still unite the masses? Is the work of uniting the masses no longer important? Can we use the power we have seized to suppress those who hold different opinions and those who have been deceived? We organized everyone to study these questions by closely following and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of thousands of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is what today's revolution needs to attack the counter-revolution." Although the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories in the past year, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads has not ended. The victory of seizing power is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. After the proletarian revolutionary factions seize power, they still face serious tasks of struggle. To complete this historical mission and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, relying on a few people is not enough. We proletarian revolutionary factions must unite all who can be united, and unite the vast majority of the masses to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only in this way can we isolate and strike the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to the greatest extent, and only in this way can we achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Developing and strengthening the proletarian revolutionary ranks, uniting the majority of the masses, is Chairman Mao's consistent strategic thinking. In his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao criticized some comrades' factionalism, pointing out that in the eyes of these comrades, "it seems that the fewer people, the better; the smaller the circle, the better." Those who hold such factionalism are opposed to this idea: mobilize all positive factors, unite all who can be united, and as far as possible turn negative factors into positive factors to serve the great cause of building a socialist society." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, we feel: to regard the work of uniting the masses as a temporary measure, needed at this time but not at that time; needed to support the masses before seizing power but can be ignored after seizing power, this is completely against Mao Zedong Thought. The mass line is the core of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The struggle between the two lines has always been centered on the issue of the masses. After the proletarian revolutionary factions seize power, they should become models in executing the mass line and uniting the masses, and absolutely should not practice factionalism. If this work is regarded as unimportant, or even if suppression is used against those who hold different opinions and those who have been deceived, it will cause us to become detached from the masses, and may even lead to directional and line errors.

The key lies in starting from the desire to unite

To resolve contradictions among the people and unite the majority of the masses, the key is whether there is a desire to unite. Chairman Mao said: "First of all, we must start from the desire to unite. Because if there is no desire to unite subjectively, one fight will surely make things chaotic and uncontrollable, that is not 'ruthless struggle, merciless blows'? Where is the unity of the Party?" Based on this teaching, we feel that the work of uniting and winning over the deceived masses has not been done well in the past, mainly because there was a lack of the desire to unite.

Our revolutionary faction comrades have been struck and suppressed by the handful of power-holders within the factory who are taking the capitalist road, and they have a strong hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line. When criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, some comrades were very resentful towards those who had attacked the revolutionary faction, saying, "They persecuted us before, now let them taste it." Some people, upon seeing the deceived comrades, would call them "royalist clowns" and "die-hard reactionaries" without analysis. Some even applied pressure to them, ordering them to confess their problems. In this way, the deceived comrades were actually treated as enemies, so there was no question of any desire to unite.

Based on this situation, we organized all revolutionary faction fighters to seriously study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and related articles from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily." Everyone realized that the idea and method of making the deceived masses "taste it" is extremely wrong. This is not starting from revolutionary interests, but from personal or small group interests, and the starting point is wrong. Our contradictions with the deceived comrades are contradictions among the people. They were deceived by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, took the wrong path, and stood in the wrong camp. However, the vast majority of them are our class brothers, and they are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We should direct our hatred towards the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and should not hate these deceived comrades.

To do a good job of uniting the majority, our headquarters summarized past work, checked for shortcomings and errors, and made a serious self-criticism. In large and small meetings, we repeatedly emphasized: do not do things that are not conducive to unity, do not say things that are not conducive to unity. We must firmly grasp the big direction, unite comrades, and unite against the enemy.

Through the study and practice of Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary faction comrades' understanding has been raised, the desire to unite has been strengthened, and a lot of work has been done to enlighten the deceived masses, achieving remarkable results. There was a comrade who had participated in a conservative organization. In the past, we tried to suppress him, which instead created serious opposition. Later, we changed our attitude and methods. First, through a big criticism, we exposed a large number of shocking facts of class struggle, promoting his enlightenment. On this basis, we sincerely talked to him, and together recalled the determination we both expressed at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution: "Forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution, be a good worker of Chairman Mao." At the same time, we criticized his mistakes, pointing out that the opposition between us was caused by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and that if we were to settle accounts, we should settle them with those people. Through in-depth and detailed ideological work, he finally awakened, bravely stood up to make revolution, exposed many problems, and joined the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters.

We must be good at listening to different opinions

At one point, we had relaxed the ideological work with the cadres. Those who had different opinions from us put up big posters saying we "suppress a large number and protect a few." This statement is obviously wrong. At that time, some comrades were impatient and wanted to use coercive measures to cover up this big poster. However, most comrades did not agree with this approach. After serious study, we believed that on the one hand, we should use facts and reasoning to refute this wrong statement, and on the other hand, we should also admit that our ideological work with some cadres was indeed not done well and needed improvement. Therefore, we mobilized various combat teams to pay attention to the ideological work with the cadres. Some comrades used their time after work to talk to the cadres, and some comrades did not rest on Sundays, going deep into the cadres' homes to do work with the cadres' families. In this way, many cadres came out and joined the revolutionary faction ranks.

This incident gave us great enlightenment. The revolutionary masses actively proposed opinions about our work, reflecting the revolutionary sense of responsibility of the masses, and it is also a supervision of us, which is a good thing that should be greatly welcomed. Some comrades have disagreements with us, and even oppose us, and their opinions are often more pointed. This is not a bad thing. Their criticisms and opinions are also a good supervision for us. Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, whoever points out to us is fine. As long as you are right, we will correct it. If your method is good for the people, we will do it your way." We proletarian revolutionary factions should have a broad mind and be good at listening to different opinions. Any opinion should be analyzed, and we should not easily say it is a "capitalist restoration countercurrent." If we seize power and are not good at listening to different opinions, we will become detached from the masses, lose the supervision of the masses, and will not be able to hold power well and use power well. The power we have seized will not be consolidated.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Not only should we unite with those who agree with us, but we should also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and we should also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. No matter who it is, as long as they are not enemies, we should give them the opportunity to express their opinions. As long as they are right, we will accept it. Even if they speak wrongly, it doesn't matter, we should let them finish speaking and then explain. Only in this way can we unite the majority of the masses to make revolution together and do a better job.

    听毛主席的话　团结一切可以团结的人	    北京邮票厂革命造反总部
        夺权以后还要不要团结群众
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，我们厂的无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。夺权以后，革命造反派的地位改变了，有些同志就以为：权已经掌握在我们手里了，团结群众的工作可以放一放了。也有的同志说：“我们有了权，谁敢不听？有人和我们闹对立，我们就整他。”
    无产阶级革命派掌权后，要不要继续团结群众呢？团结群众的工作是不是无关紧要了呢？能不能利用夺得的大权，对持有不同意见的群众和受蒙蔽的群众实行压服呢？我们组织大家带着这些问题，活学活用毛主席著作。
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，虽然已经取得了伟大的胜利，但是，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，并没有就此结束。夺权的胜利，只是万里长征走完了第一步。无产阶级革命派掌权后，还面临着严重的斗争任务。要完成这个历史重任，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，只靠少数人是不行的。我们无产阶级革命派，只有团结一切可以团结的人们，把绝大多数群众团结到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，才有利于最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。
    发展和壮大无产阶级革命队伍，团结大多数群众，是毛主席一贯的战略思想。在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作里，毛主席批评了一些同志的小圈子主义，指出，在这些同志看来，“似乎人越少越好，圈子紧缩得越小越好。抱有这种小圈子主义的人们，对于这样一种思想是抵触的：调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义社会这个伟大的事业服务。”对照毛主席的教导，我们感到：把团结群众的工作看成一种权宜之计，这个时候需要，那个时候就不需要；夺权以前需要群众的支持，夺权以后就可以把群众丢开，这完全是违背毛泽东思想的。群众路线，是毛主席革命路线的核心。两条路线的斗争，一直围绕在群众的问题上。无产阶级革命派掌了权，就应该成为执行群众路线的模范，团结群众的模范，绝不能搞小圈子主义。如果把这个工作看得无关紧要，甚至对持有不同意见的群众和受蒙蔽的群众采取压制的手段，就会使自己脱离群众，甚至可能犯方向性路线性的错误。
        关键在于从团结的愿望出发
    解决人民内部矛盾，团结大多数群众，关键在于有没有团结的愿望。毛主席说：“首先需要从团结的愿望出发。因为如果在主观上没有团结的愿望，一斗势必把事情斗乱，不可收拾，那还不是‘残酷斗争，无情打击’？那还有什么党的团结？”根据这个教导，我们感到过去对受蒙蔽群众的团结、争取工作，所以做得不够，主要就是因为缺乏团结的愿望。
    我们革命派的同志，受到厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的打击、镇压，对资产阶级反动路线有着强烈的仇恨。在批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，有的同志对围攻过造反派的人也非常愤恨，说：“他们过去整了我们，今儿也叫他们尝尝味道。”也有的人一见受蒙蔽的同志，就不加分析地叫“保皇小丑”、“铁杆”。甚至对他们施加压力，勒令他们交代问题。这样，实际上把受蒙蔽的同志当作敌人看待，当然谈不上什么团结的愿望。
    根据这种情况，我们组织全体革命派战士，认真地学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》等有关文章。大家认识到：那种叫受蒙蔽群众“尝尝味道”的以牙还牙的想法和作法，是非常错误的。这不是从革命利益出发，而是从个人或小团体的私利出发，出发点首先就错了。我们同受蒙蔽同志的矛盾是人民内部的矛盾。他们受了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，走错了路，站错了队，但是，他们当中的绝大多数是我们的阶级兄弟，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。我们应当把仇恨集中到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上，不应该仇视这些受蒙蔽的同志。
    为了做好团结大多数的工作，我们总部总结了过去的工作，检查了缺点和错误，作了认真的自我批评。我们在大会、小会上反复强调：不要做不利于团结的事，不要说不利于团结的话。一定要牢牢掌握住大方向，团结同志，一致对敌。
    通过毛主席著作的学习和实践，革命派同志的认识提高了，团结的愿望加强了，对受蒙蔽的群众进行了大量的工作，收到了显著的效果。有一个参加过保守组织的同志，过去我们想压服他，反而造成严重对立。后来我们改变了态度和作法，首先通过大批判，揭出大量触目惊心的阶级斗争的事实，促进了他的觉悟。在这个基础上，又诚恳地找他谈心，同他一起回忆文化大革命初期共同表示的决心：“永远跟着毛主席干革命，当毛主席的好工人。”同时，也批评了他的错误，指出我们之间的对立是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派造成的，要算账就要跟他们算。经过深入细致的思想工作，终于使他觉悟过来，勇敢地站出来革命，揭发了不少问题，参加了革命造反总部。
            要善于听取不同意见
    前一个时候，我们曾经一度放松了干部的思想工作。和我们有不同意见的同志就贴出大标语，说我们“压制一大片，保护一小撮”。这种说法显然是错误的。当时，有的同志就沉不住气，想用强制手段，把这个大标语盖上。但是，大部分同志不同意这种做法。经过认真地研究，我们认为：一方面，对这种错误说法，应当用摆事实讲道理的方法给予批驳，另方面，也应当承认我们对一些干部的思想工作，确实做得不够，需要加以改进。于是，我们就发动各战斗队，注意做干部的思想工作。有的同志利用下班后的时间找干部谈心，有的同志星期日不休息，深入干部家里，做干部家属的工作。这样，促使很多干部亮了相，加入了革命派队伍。
    这件事给了我们很大的启发。革命群众对我们的工作积极提出意见，反映了群众的革命责任感，也是对我们的监督，这是值得大大欢迎的好事。有些同志和我们有分歧，甚至反对我们，他们的意见往往提得尖锐一些，这也不是什么坏事。他们的批评和意见，对我们也是一种很好的监督。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”我们无产阶级革命派，应该胸襟宽广，善于听取不同意见。对任何意见都要进行分析，决不能动不动就说成是“资本主义复辟逆流”。如果我们掌了权以后，不善于听取不同意见，就会脱离群众，失去群众的监督，就不可能掌好权，用好权。已经夺得的权就不可能巩固。
    毛主席教导我们：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”我们一定要按照毛主席的指示办事，虚心听取群众意见。无论什么人，只要不是敌人，就应该给他们提意见的机会，只要他提得对，我们就接受，即使讲错了话，也不要紧，应该让别人把话说完，再进行解释。只有这样，我们才能够把大多数群众团结起来一道干革命，才能把工作做得更好。
