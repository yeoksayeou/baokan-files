The Burmese reactionary government, since June 26, has continuously committed unprecedented barbaric fascist anti-Chinese atrocities, pushing Sino-Burmese relations to an unprecedented deterioration. Under its instigation and command, thousands of rioters have been relentlessly attacking our embassy in Burma and other institutions, injuring our diplomatic personnel, assassinating our experts assisting Burma, looting and burning Chinese residential areas and Chinese organizations, and massively arresting and massacring patriotic overseas Chinese. This is an appalling crime in the history of international relations!

This wave of anti-Chinese fascist atrocities was entirely planned, organized, and executed by the Burmese reactionary government. It was this reactionary government that issued orders banning overseas Chinese students from wearing badges of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. It was this reactionary government that instructed official newspapers to spread lies and incite anti-Chinese sentiments. It was also this reactionary government that announced the closure of overseas Chinese schools, incited and organized rioters to commit violence, and dispatched military police to protect them as they burned and killed. The Burmese government has acted with extreme cruelty and arrogance. You are the chief culprits of this bloody anti-Chinese incident. This debt of blood must be repaid by you!

The Burmese government's frenzied anti-Chinese actions have fully exposed its fascist counter-revolutionary face.

The Burmese ruling clique came to power through a military coup in 1962. After seizing power, it discarded the facade of bourgeois democracy, implemented military fascist rule, and under the guise of "nationalization," seized control of Burma's economic lifelines. Under this regime, not only workers, peasants, and other laboring masses suffer cruel oppression and ruthless exploitation, but a significant number of petty bourgeoisie have also been plundered and driven to bankruptcy. This has led to the increasing decline of Burma's industry and agriculture, and the national economy is sinking into a more severe crisis.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance; the greater the oppression, the stronger the resistance. Over the past five years, the contradictions between the Burmese people and the ruling clique have become increasingly sharp. Strikes and protests by workers and students have been incessant. The armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party has overcome numerous difficulties and is advancing towards victory. In particular, over the past year, the people's revolutionary armed forces have grown stronger, consolidated and expanded their base areas, and further strengthened their close ties with the broad masses of the people. The Burmese national democratic revolution has made new and significant developments.

Like all reactionaries, the Burmese ruling clique, while still able to maintain its rule, always tries to keep some final touches for itself. Previously, domestically, the Burmese government had already discarded the facade of bourgeois democracy, but in foreign relations, it still advocated so-called "active neutrality." However, as class struggles intensify and the people's revolutionary forces continue to grow and strengthen, when the reactionary rule begins to waver, it will inevitably discard all facades and fully reveal its ugly face.

The Burmese ruling clique has torn off all its masks and created a bloody anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese incident, which clearly indicates its difficult and weak situation. It foolishly hopes to divert the attention of the domestic people, so as to more fiercely suppress the revolutionary forces within Burma.

The Burmese reactionary government, which brutally suppresses the people's resistance at home, will inevitably collude with American imperialism and its main accomplice, the Soviet revisionist clique, and take the path of pro-imperialist, pro-revisionist, betrayal, and anti-China. The Burmese reactionary government's creation of frenzied anti-Chinese incidents, acting as an anti-Chinese henchman, is precisely to curry favor with American imperialism and its accomplices, the Soviet revisionists, in preparation for further surrender to them.

However, we must warn the Burmese government that you will find no way out from your evil anti-Chinese deeds. Over the past few years, there have been many who have eagerly sought to be anti-Chinese heroes. The United States and the Soviet Union have joined forces to be anti-Chinese, but not a single hair of China has been harmed. The reactionary regimes of India and Indonesia, which have followed the United States and the Soviet Union, have only made their own days worse. They have become anti-Chinese tools of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, becoming political garbage despised by all.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. All reactionaries in various countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote more extensive and more violent revolution among the people." The Burmese government's anti-communist and anti-people actions at home, and its pro-imperialist, pro-revisionist, and anti-Chinese actions abroad, can only hasten its own doom.

The broad overseas Chinese community in Burma has long lived with the Burmese people, forging deep bonds of friendship and struggle. They have shared the same fate and hardships with the Burmese people, fought side by side, and made significant contributions to the Burmese people's struggle for national independence. Since the liberation of the Chinese people, the broad overseas Chinese community has been nurtured by the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, with their consciousness continuously rising. They love their homeland and love the great leader Chairman Mao. They have made tireless efforts to maintain and develop the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma. In this struggle against the fascist persecution of the Burmese government, they have stood united, fearless of tyranny, and shown the heroic spirit of the great Chinese people. They are truly the good sons and daughters of the motherland.

The Burmese government's savage acts will never intimidate the brave patriotic overseas Chinese; they will become even stronger through struggle. The great motherland is the strong backing of the patriotic overseas Chinese. The 700 million people of the motherland deeply care about the plight of the patriotic overseas Chinese. No matter what serious situation arises, the people of the motherland will stand with them, supporting their just struggle against persecution.

China and Burma are neighboring countries connected by mountains and rivers. The friendship between the two peoples has developed through their common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. This is a friendship that no one can destroy. The Burmese reactionary government's frenzied anti-Chinese actions go against the interests and wishes of the Burmese people. Such retrograde actions will inevitably be opposed by the broad masses of the Burmese people. The Chinese people will forever stand with the broad masses of the Burmese people to maintain and develop this fighting friendship, and strive together!

### 缅甸政府必须立即停止一切反华暴行！

    缅甸政府必须立即停止一切反华暴行！
    缅甸反动政府，二十六日以来，连续制造了令人发指的空前野蛮的法西斯反华暴行，把中缅两国关系推到了空前恶化的地步。在它的唆使和指挥下，数千暴徒连日来疯狂地轮番袭击我国驻缅使馆和其他机构，打伤我外交人员，刺杀我援缅专家，洗劫和焚烧华侨居民区和华侨团体，大规模地逮捕和屠杀爱国华侨。这是国际关系史上骇人听闻的血腥罪行！
    这次反华法西斯暴行，完全是缅甸反动政府有计划、有组织、有步骤地策划制造的。正是缅甸反动政府发布命令禁止华侨学生佩戴中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的像章。正是这个反动政府指使官方报纸造谣惑众煽动反华。也正是这个反动政府宣布封闭华侨学校，纵容和组织暴徒行凶，并且派出军警掩护他们大烧大杀。缅甸政府干得太狠毒，太猖狂了。你们是这次血腥反华事件的罪魁祸首。这笔血债一定要你们负责偿还！
    缅甸政府的疯狂反华，是它的法西斯反革命面目的大暴露。
    缅甸统治集团是在一九六二年靠军事政变上台的。在上台以后，它抛弃了资产阶级民主的遮羞布，实行军事的法西斯统治，并且以“国有化”为名，控制了缅甸的经济命脉。在这个政权的统治下，不仅工人、农民和其他劳动群众遭到残酷的压迫和敲骨吸髓的剥削，而且为数颇多的中小资产阶级也被掠夺，沦于破产的境地。这就造成缅甸工农业日益萧条，国民经济陷于越来越严重的危机之中。
    有压迫就有反抗；压迫越厉害，反抗也就越强烈。五年多来，缅甸广大人民同缅甸统治集团的矛盾日益尖锐。工人、学生罢工、罢课斗争，此起彼伏。缅共领导的革命的武装斗争克服了重重困难，正在胜利前进。特别是最近一年来，人民革命武装日益强大，巩固和扩大了根据地，进一步加强了同广大人民群众的密切联系。缅甸的民族民主革命有了新的重大发展。
    缅甸统治集团同一切反动派一样，在它尚能维持其统治的时候，它总要给自己保留一些最后的点缀。前个时候，在国内，缅甸政府虽然已经把资产阶级民主的那一套伪装揭下了，而在对外关系上还标榜所谓“积极中立”。可是，当国内阶级斗争愈演愈烈，人民的革命力量不断发展壮大，反动派的统治发生动摇的时候，它就必然要揭去一切伪装，彻底暴露出自己的狰狞嘴脸。
    缅甸统治集团撕下了一切假面具，制造血淋淋的反华排华事件，正是表明了它的处境的困难和虚弱。它妄想靠这一手来转移国内人民的视线，以便更加疯狂地镇压缅甸国内的革命力量。
    缅甸反动政府，在国内既然疯狂地镇压人民的反抗，对外它就必然要同美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏修集团相勾结，走上亲帝联修卖国反华的道路。缅甸反动政府制造疯狂的反华事件，充当反华的打手，也正是为了讨好美帝国主义及其帮凶苏修集团，为进一步投靠它们作准备。
    但是，我们必须正告缅甸政府，你们从反华的罪恶勾当中是找不到任何出路的。几年来，热心反华的英雄好汉可谓多矣。美帝苏修联合起来反华，也没有损伤中国的一根毫毛。追随美帝和苏修的印度反动派和印尼反动派，反来反去，弄得自己的日子越来越不好混。它们已经成为美帝国主义和苏修集团的反华工具，成为人们所不齿的政治垃圾。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说过：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”缅甸政府对内反共反人民，对外亲帝联修反华，只能是加速自己的灭亡。
    在缅甸的广大华侨，长期以来同缅甸人民生活在一起，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。他们同缅甸人民曾经同命运，共患难，也曾经肩并肩地英勇战斗，反对共同的敌人帝国主义，为缅甸人民的民族独立事业，作出了重大贡献。自中国人民解放以来，广大华侨受到伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育，觉悟不断提高。他们热爱祖国，热爱伟大领袖毛主席。他们为维护和发展中缅两国人民的友谊，作了辛勤的努力。在这次反对缅甸政府的法西斯迫害的斗争中，他们团结一致，不畏强暴，表现了伟大的中国人民的英雄气概。他们不愧是祖国的好儿女。
    缅甸政府的野蛮兽行，绝对吓不倒英勇的爱国侨胞，他们将在斗争中锻炼得更加坚强。伟大的祖国是爱国侨胞的强大靠山。七亿祖国人民深切关怀爱国侨胞的处境。不管发生什么样的严重情况，祖国人民都将和他们在一起，支持他们反对迫害的正义斗争。
    中缅两国是山水相连的邻国，两国人民的友谊是在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中发展起来的。这是任何人也破坏不了的。缅甸反动政府猖狂反华，是违反缅甸人民利益和愿望的。这种倒行逆施，必然要受到广大缅甸人民的反对。中国人民将永远同广大缅甸人民一起，为维护和发展我们之间的这种战斗的友谊，共同奋斗！
