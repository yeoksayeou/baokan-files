Japanese revolutionary people and people from all walks of life held a solemn memorial meeting on June 15 in front of the south gate of the National Diet in Tokyo to commemorate Kaneko Michiko, a national hero who sacrificed her life seven years ago in the struggle against American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.

Kaneko Michiko was killed in the Japanese National Diet building on June 15, 1960, during the struggle against the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" by the police's bloody suppression.

At the memorial meeting for Kaneko Michiko, people could not help but think of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, who at that time pointed out that Kaneko Michiko had become a famous Japanese national hero known throughout the world. People also could not help but think of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists who, by various means, persecuted the young pioneers who dared to rebel against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. In the days leading up to the memorial meeting, Kaneko Michiko's parents and some Japanese revolutionaries told Chinese reporters that Kaneko Michiko was a true national hero who was slandered by the Japanese Communist Party revisionists as a so-called "Trotskyist."

Several hundred people, including Kaneko Michiko's parents and people from all walks of life, participated in the memorial meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to inherit Kaneko Michiko's will and resolutely fight to smash the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

Kaneko Michiko was a student at Tokyo University. She was killed by the police of the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government, which was a puppet of American imperialism, while participating in the anti-"U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" anti-American patriotic and just struggle. The "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" is an unequal treaty by which American imperialism enslaves and controls Japan. It is a military alliance treaty of aggression by American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries against the Chinese and Asian peoples. On June 15, 1960, 5.8 million workers and people from all walks of life across Japan participated in a massive general strike and powerful demonstrations against the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." Kaneko Michiko actively participated in the struggle. She, along with tens of thousands of students, went to the National Diet to hold a protest demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Down with Kishi Nobusuke!" The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries dispatched several thousand police to carry out bloody suppression, killing Kaneko Michiko and others, and injuring hundreds of people.

Kaneko Michiko's sacrifice sparked an even more intense protest demonstration movement among the Japanese people. They forced Kishi Nobusuke to announce the indefinite postponement of the then-U.S. President Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan, and finally forced the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke government to announce its resignation eight days later (June 23).

Now, the Japanese people are continuing their unyielding and unremitting struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs.

    日本革命人民集会追悼民族英雄桦美智子
    决心继承桦美智子的遗志为反对美日反动派而坚决斗争
    据新华社十七日讯  据东方通讯社报道，日本革命人民和各界人士为了纪念七年前在反对美帝国主义和日本反动派斗争中英勇牺牲的民族英雄桦美智子，十五日在东京国会南便门前举行了隆重的追悼会。
    桦美智子在一九六○年六月十五日在日本人民反对“日美安全保障条约”的斗争中，在日本国会院内遭到警察队的血腥镇压而壮烈牺牲的。
    在追悼桦美智子的会上，人们无不想到世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席当时所指出的，桦美智子已成全世界闻名的日本民族英雄。人们也无不想到日共修正主义分子，千方百计地迫害敢于起来向美日反动派造反的青年闯将，他们往往用这样或那样的莫须有的罪名陷害青年革命者。在举行追悼会的前几天，桦美智子的双亲和一些日本革命者对中国记者说，桦美智子就是被日共修正主义分子污蔑为所谓“托派”的一个真正的民族英雄。
    民族英雄桦美智子的双亲和各界人士等几百人参加了追悼会。他们一致表示，继承桦美智子遗志，坚决为粉碎“日美安全保障条约”而斗争。
    桦美智子生前是东京大学的学生。她是在参加反对“日美安全保障条约”的反美爱国正义斗争时，被美帝国主义走狗岸信介反动政府的警察杀死的。“日美安全保障条约”是美帝国主义奴役和控制日本的不平等条约，是美帝国主义和日本反动派以中国和亚洲人民为敌的侵略性军事同盟条约。一九六○年六月十五日，日本全国各地五百八十万工人和各阶层人民一起，举行了轰轰烈烈的反对“日美安全保障条约”的总罢工和强大示威。桦美智子积极地参加了斗争。她和上万名学生一起到国会举行抗议示威，高呼“打倒岸信介”等口号。美日反动派出动数千名警察进行血腥镇压，打死了桦美智子等人，打伤数百人。
    桦美智子的牺牲，激起日本人民开展更加强烈的抗议示威运动。他们迫使岸信介宣布无限期推迟当时的美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本的计划，并且终于在八天以后（六月二十三日）迫使岸信介卖国政府宣布下台。
    现在，日本人民正在前赴后继、不屈不挠地坚持进行反对美帝及其走狗的正义斗争。
