Whoever dares to provoke the Chinese people will meet a bad end!

The Indian spy Lu Guannan is escorted out of Beijing

New China News Agency, June 14th

The Indian spy Lu Guannan, who was sentenced to be expelled from China, was escorted out of Beijing this morning amidst the angry shouts of the revolutionary masses of the capital. Vijay, the Third Secretary of the Indian Embassy in China, who was declared persona non grata and ordered to leave within a specified time, also left Beijing on the same flight.

Today, more than a thousand revolutionary masses of the capital, filled with indignation towards American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries, gathered at the capital's airport to drive out the pestilence. Shouts of "Down with American imperialism!", "Down with Soviet revisionism!", "Down with the Indian reactionaries!", and "Spy Lu Guannan, get out of China!" echoed through the airport.

When the Indian spy Lu Guannan and the staff of the Indian Embassy entered the capital's airport, our public security personnel and Red Guards, in accordance with the judgment of the Special People's Court of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court, stepped forward to carry out the task of escorting the spy Lu Guannan. The staff of the Indian Embassy, in order to avoid the just condemnation of our revolutionary masses, refused to hand over Lu Guannan and did not allow our public security personnel and Red Guards to carry out the escort task. This deliberate act of shielding the spy criminal aroused great indignation among our revolutionary masses. Under the stern rebuke of our public security personnel and Red Guards, the staff of the Indian Embassy had no choice but to hand over the spy Lu Guannan. However, the spy Lu Guannan, under the protection of the staff of the Indian Embassy, did not allow our public security personnel and Red Guards to carry out the escort task and did not follow the designated route into the airport, but instead rushed in disorderly, repeatedly provoking our revolutionary masses and deliberately creating trouble. Vijay, who collaborated with Lu Guannan in spy activities, also repeatedly provoked the revolutionary masses, with a very arrogant attitude. Our revolutionary masses, witnessing the arrogance of the Indian spy Lu Guannan and Vijay, who collaborated with Lu Guannan in spy activities, were furious and sternly rebuked and condemned the unreasonable provocations of Lu Guannan and others.

The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. The revolutionary masses at the airport fought resolutely against the Indian spy Lu Guannan and others. Wherever our public security personnel and Red Guards escorted the spy criminals, there were angry shouts: Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries dare to provoke the Chinese people, they will meet a bad end! Under the strong denunciation of the revolutionary masses, the spy Lu Guannan was disgraced, hanging his head, and was escorted into the aircraft cabin by our public security personnel and Red Guards.

As the plane carrying the Indian spy Lu Guannan left the apron, our revolutionary masses raised their arms again and shouted: "All spies will not escape the net of the Chinese people!" "Resolutely purge all spies of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in China!" "Heighten revolutionary vigilance and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!"

    谁胆敢向中国人民进行挑衅，决没有好下场！
    印度间谍分子鲁冠南被押离北京
    新华社十四日讯　被我判处驱逐出境的印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南，今天清晨在首都革命群众的一片愤怒的口号声中，被我公安人员和红卫兵押送离开北京。被我宣布为不受欢迎的勒令限期离境的印度驻华大使馆三等秘书维杰也同机离京。
    今天，首都革命群众一千多人，怀着对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印度反动派无比愤怒的心情，在首都机场怒逐瘟神。“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒印度反动派！”“间谍分子鲁冠南滚出中国去！”的口号声，响彻机场上空。
    当印度间谍犯鲁冠南和印度驻华大使馆人员进入首都机场前，我公安人员和红卫兵根据北京市高级人民法院特别人民法庭的判决，走上前去执行押送间谍犯鲁冠南的任务。印度驻华大使馆人员为了逃避我革命群众的正义谴责，竟拒绝交出鲁冠南，不让我公安人员和红卫兵执行押送任务。这种蓄意包庇间谍罪犯的恶劣行为激起我革命群众的极大愤慨。在我公安人员和红卫兵严正驳斥下，印度驻华大使馆人员才不得不交出间谍犯鲁冠南。但是间谍犯鲁冠南在印度驻华大使馆人员的簇拥下，不让我公安人员和红卫兵执行押送任务，并且不按指定路线进入机场，迳自乱闯，不断向我革命群众挑衅，蓄意制造事端。伙同鲁冠南进行间谍活动的维杰也一再向革命群众挑衅，态度极为蛮横。我革命群众目睹印度间谍犯鲁冠南和伙同鲁冠南进行间谍活动的维杰如此猖狂，怒不可遏，严正训斥和谴责鲁冠南等的无理挑衅。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的。在机场上的革命群众同印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南等进行了坚决的斗争。我公安人员和红卫兵小将把间谍犯押到那里，那里就响起愤怒的吼声：帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派胆敢向中国人民进行挑衅，决没有好下场！间谍分子鲁冠南在强大的革命群众的愤怒声讨下，狼狈不堪，搭拉着脑袋，被我公安人员和红卫兵押进机舱。
    载有印度间谍分子鲁冠南的飞机离开停机坪时，我革命群众再一次振臂高呼：“一切间谍分子休想逃出中国人民的天罗地网！”“坚决肃清一切帝修反在华的间谍分子！”“提高革命警惕性，保卫无产阶级文化大革命！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”
