The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on June 13, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists, who, while escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam, have colluded with their lackeys in Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppets to repeatedly launch armed invasions into the Kingdom of Cambodia, seriously threatening the security of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The statement reaffirms: The Chinese government fully respects the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia within its current borders and firmly opposes all plots by U.S. imperialists and their Thai and South Vietnamese lackeys to invade Cambodian territory. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	In recent years, while continuously escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialists, in collusion with their lackeys in Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppets, have repeatedly launched armed invasions into the Kingdom of Cambodia, seriously threatening the security of the Kingdom of Cambodia. To defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to smash the territorial ambitions of U.S. imperialists and their lackeys against Cambodia, the Kingdom of Cambodia has resolutely counterattacked. Furthermore, on November 2, 1966, and May 9, 1967, the Kingdom of Cambodia issued two government bulletins, demanding that friendly countries respect the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia within its current borders.

	The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued statements on May 31 and June 8, 1967, respectively, expressing their acknowledgment and guarantee to respect the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia within its current borders; acknowledging and guaranteeing to respect the current border line between South Vietnam and Cambodia; and strongly condemning the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialists and their lackeys in Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppets against the Kingdom of Cambodia.

	The Chinese government believes that the positions of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia not only serve the interests of the peoples of the two countries but also benefit the common struggle of the peoples of Indochina to unite against U.S. imperialism.

	Chairman Mao has taught us: "The People's Republic of China has consistently sought to establish and develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has pursued a policy of good neighborliness towards all neighboring countries."

	The Chinese government and the Chinese people have consistently followed Chairman Mao's teachings, establishing and developing friendly relations with the countries of Indochina, respecting the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all countries. The serious position of the Chinese government and the Chinese people is well known.

	The Chinese government reaffirms: The Chinese government fully respects the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia within its current borders and will, as always, resolutely oppose all plots by U.S. imperialists and their Thai and South Vietnamese lackeys to invade Cambodian territory.

    我外交部发表声明重申我国政府的一贯严正立场
    完全尊重柬埔寨目前边界内的领土完整
    强烈谴责美帝及其走狗侵犯柬埔寨领土
    新华社十三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十三日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义在不断扩大侵越战争的同时，伙同它的仆从泰国和南越傀儡，不断对柬埔寨王国进行武装侵犯，使柬埔寨王国的安全受到严重的威胁。声明重申：中国政府完全尊重柬埔寨王国在目前边界内的领土完整，并坚决反对美帝国主义及其泰国、南越仆从侵犯柬埔寨领土的一切阴谋活动。声明全文如下：
    近几年来，美帝国主义在不断扩大侵略越南战争的同时，伙同它的仆从泰国和南越傀儡，不断对柬埔寨王国进行武装侵犯，使柬埔寨王国的安全受到严重的威胁。为了捍卫国家主权和领土完整，粉碎美帝国主义及其仆从对柬埔寨的领土野心，柬埔寨王国对它们进行了坚决的反击，并且在一九六六年十一月二日和一九六七年五月九日，两次发表政府公报，要求友好国家尊重柬埔寨王国在目前边界内的领土完整。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府，分别于一九六七年五月三十一日、六月八日发表声明，表示承认和保证尊重柬埔寨王国在目前边界内的领土完整；承认和保证尊重越南南方和柬埔寨之间的目前边界线；强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗泰国和南越傀儡对柬埔寨王国的侵略阴谋。
    中国政府认为，越南南方民族解放阵线、越南民主共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府的立场，不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且有利于印度支那各国人民团结反美的共同斗争。
    毛主席教导我们说：“中华人民共和国一贯寻求在平等互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的基础上建立和发展同一切国家的友好关系，并且对所有邻国执行睦邻政策。”
    中国政府和中国人民一贯遵照毛主席的教导，同印度支那各国建立和发展友好关系，尊重各国的独立、主权和领土完整。中国政府和中国人民的这种严正立场，是众所周知的。
    中国政府重申：中国政府完全尊重柬埔寨王国在目前边界内的领土完整，并将一如既往，坚决反对美帝国主义及其泰国、南越仆从侵犯柬埔寨领土的一切阴谋活动。
