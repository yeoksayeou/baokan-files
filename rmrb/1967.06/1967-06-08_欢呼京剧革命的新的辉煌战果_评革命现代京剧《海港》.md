The revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Port," created and performed by the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe, uses bold and powerful strokes, vibrant colors, and soaring melodies to depict the surging and magnificent real-life struggles of Shanghai port workers in the 1960s. It passionately portrays the revolutionary heroes of the contemporary working class, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and command the winds and clouds. It is the first revolutionary modern Peking opera to reflect the struggles of the working class during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. It is the first revolutionary modern Peking opera to depict the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in a socialist society. It is the first revolutionary modern Peking opera to sing the praises of the Chinese working class, who are filled with internationalist spirit, supporting the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world. The successful performance of "The Port" has opened up a broad path for Peking opera to depict socialist reality.

Chairman Mao pointed out to us as early as twenty-five years ago the great direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. For twenty-five years, the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of literature and art and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line supported by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has focused on the question of for which class literature and art should serve and for which class's politics it should serve. In the field of drama, it is a question of whether the proletariat or the bourgeoisie occupies the stage. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of literature and art, the Peking opera revolution, ballet revolution, and symphony revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing have turned the stage, which had been turned upside down, right side up again, creating a new historical era where workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy the stage. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of literature and art!

"The Port" depicts the tumultuous and stormy life of the Shanghai port in 1963. Through the story of Shanghai port workers who, with a focus on politics, successfully complete an international aid mission, the play reveals a fierce class struggle in the ideological realm during the socialist revolutionary period. It shows how the working class in the socialist era, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, launches an attack on bourgeois ideology and the ideology of all exploiting classes, carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end with a thorough revolutionary spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Socialist society is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there are still classes, class contradictions, and class struggle. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, class struggle ultimately boils down to the question of power, that is, whether the proletariat will consolidate proletarian dictatorship or the bourgeoisie will overthrow proletarian dictatorship. This struggle between restoration and counter-restoration is particularly prominent in the ideological realm.

In the revolutionary Peking opera "The Port," there are no gunshots, no fighting, no grim and terrifying execution grounds with clanking chains. However, the socialist port is not calm and peaceful. Here, not only are there roaring waves and surging tides in nature, but there are also waves of class struggle that shake the world. The scattered package incident described in "The Port" is a wave in the ideological realm of class struggle. The former warehouse manager, Mr. Zhang, and the retained warehouse clerk, Qian Shouwei, who worked in the port before liberation, constantly yearn for their lost "paradise." In the port, they not only spread glass fibers but also constantly spread the poisonous mists of bourgeois ideology, such as "stinky laborers are three inches shorter in front of people" and "eight hours outside is your freedom." They even slander the port workers: "Relying on people like us, can the port be managed well?" Young worker Han Xiaqiang was poisoned by the bourgeois ideology of people like Qian Shouwei, looked down on port work, and even caused a scattered package error, leading to the loss of his work permit and leaving the port. Isn't this a heart-pounding class struggle in the ideological realm? Qian Shouwei constantly uses bourgeois ideology to corrupt the proletarian ranks and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. This is the social basis for the attempt by the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the Party, the government, and the military, and to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists are representatives of the class interests of such bourgeois elements. "The Port" deeply depicts a class struggle in the ideological realm under proletarian dictatorship and a struggle between two classes over the succession.

"The Port" not only reflects class struggle but also emphasizes the proactive position and inevitable victory of the working class in the socialist era in the struggle against restoration. Lenin said: "Only those who recognize class struggle and also recognize proletarian dictatorship are Marxists." Today, only those who recognize proletarian dictatorship and also recognize that under the historical conditions of proletarian dictatorship, there is still a struggle between restoration and counter-restoration, a struggle between the proletariat to defend proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, are true Marxists. Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang in "The Port" are such Marxists. They can see through any bourgeois tricks and can withstand all the storms of class struggle. Branch Secretary Fang Haizhen always emphasizes politics, never forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings about the existence of classes and class struggle in socialist society. Whether facing roaring waves or poisonous mists, she concentrates her fiery class feelings and ardent fighting spirit on the main chord of class struggle. She uses the perspective of class struggle to observe, analyze, and solve all problems, showing special political sensitivity. When a scattered package error occurs at the port, she immediately thinks, "Thoughts are scattered, so packages are scattered; thoughts are wrong, so packages are wrong." Qian Shouwei spreads glass fibers at the port, but Fang Haizhen acutely senses that "more seriously, he also spreads a lot of invisible bourgeois ideology." In the face of complex situations such as scattered packages, errors, and transfer requests, Fang Haizhen is confident and firmly grasps the main line of "production cannot forget political priority" and "there is class struggle everywhere on the journey." She points out to Qian Shouwei, "Numbers have been checked, but thoughts also need to be checked!" For Han Xiaqiang, she is full of deep class feelings, caring for him in every way, and patiently helping and educating him. Her ideological work is carried out at the height of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over their successors. With her strong class hatred, moving class struggle experience, and great communist ideals, she educates Han Xiaqiang, who finally recognizes his mistakes and resolves to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, carry the revolution through to the end, and thoroughly smashes the plot of people like Qian Shouwei to corrupt the youth and attempt restoration.

The script powerfully argues that the Chinese working class of the 1960s, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, not only can seize power from the bourgeoisie but also can firmly hold onto proletarian power, fight against bourgeois and all exploiting class ideologies, and ensure that the red socialist mountains remain unchanged for generations, planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. Let the capitalist restoration dream of the Chinese Khrushchev, along with his rotten goods of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," go to hell!

Chairman Mao said that we must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. The Chinese working class is not only a pioneer of the three great revolutionary movements at home but also a great internationalist. The Chinese revolutionary people will always stand together, fight together, and win together with the revolutionary people of the world, resolutely supporting their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles, and vowing to be their strong backbone. "The Port" takes the theme of singing the praises of internationalism, for the first time displaying on the Peking opera stage the great aspirations of the Chinese working class in the socialist era, who have their hearts in their country and their eyes on the world, supporting the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Before liberation, Chinese port workers suffered deeply under the oppression of the "three big mountains." Fang Haizhen, Gao Zhiyang, and Ma Hongliang have a hatred for imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries that is deeper than the waters of the Huangpu River. Under the leadership of the Party, they have been liberated, but they have not forgotten that three-fifths of the people in the world are still living in miserable conditions. They have such deep class feelings for the oppressed peoples of the world! They follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people who have already won the revolution should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation." They regard their ordinary port work as an internationalist duty to support the world revolution. In their eyes, "every package and every item is connected to the world's winds and clouds." The Gao Zhiyang team, in order to complete the international aid mission ahead of schedule, is full of enthusiasm, rushing to transport, and when machinery is insufficient, they use their shoulders to carry. After discovering the scattered package incident, Gao Zhiyang's heart is like a knife, not caring that his child is seriously ill at home, immediately gathering the whole team to find the root cause, resolutely sorting through the warehouse overnight, carefully checking every one of the two thousand packages of wheat. Later, when it was found that the scattered wheat had been mistakenly loaded onto a barge as rice and sent to Wusong, in the face of the extremely urgent situation, he bravely boarded a motorboat, braved the thunder and rain, the surging tides, and the dangerous waves, and resolutely set out to sea to chase the boat, finally retrieving the wheat packages and successfully completing the international aid mission. "The Port" passionately sings the praises of the great internationalist aspirations of the Chinese working class in the socialist era, who stand on the port, have their hearts in their country, and their eyes on the world, supporting the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world. It shows the magnificent reality of "revolutionary winds and clouds surging around the world, awakened peoples looking up to Beijing; the East Wind of Mao Zedong Thought spreading, the battle cry resonating across the five continents" and displays the brilliant prospect of communism taking complete victory in the world.

The attitude towards national liberation movements is the dividing line between true Marxists and false Marxists. National struggles ultimately boil down to class struggles. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, together with Khrushchev, sings in unison and seeks common ground, vigorously promoting the fallacy of "three reconciliations and one reduction," saying that towards imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary regimes of various countries, one should reconcile, and towards countries engaged in national liberation struggles, one should reduce support. This is truly a traitorous face of betraying Marxism-Leninism, betraying the proletarian revolution, betraying the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world, and surrendering to imperialism. The performance of "The Port" is a powerful refutation of this revisionist fallacy; the performance of "The Port" directly inspires the current anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world, and is beneficial to the great struggle of "all the peoples of the world uniting to defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs"; the performance of "The Port" opens up the path for the proletarian literature and art of China to serve the revolutionary peoples of China and the world.

"The Port" is a song of praise for the heroes of the working class in the socialist era; it is a song of victory for class struggle; it is a hymn to proletarian internationalism. In a word, "The Port" is a great battle song of Mao Zedong Thought. We say: "The Port" is very good, indeed very good!

The successful performance of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Port" is a great victory in the struggle for proletarian power in the field of literature and art. This is a great event in the Peking opera revolution that is inspiring and encouraging. We enthusiastically hail this great victory. Let us raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and their supported counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the field of literature and art, and firmly seize the leadership of the literary and artistic front from the proletariat, creating more and better revolutionary modern Peking operas that reflect the reality of life since the founding of the country!

    欢呼京剧革命的新的辉煌战果
    ——评革命现代京剧《海港》
    沈鸿鑫
    上海京剧院创作并演出的革命现代京剧《海港》，以粗犷雄浑的笔触，浓烈酣畅的色彩，高亢激越的旋律，描写了六十年代上海港码头工人汹涌澎湃、瑰丽绚烂的现实斗争生活，满怀激情地塑造了毛泽东思想武装起来的当代工人阶级叱咤风云的革命英雄形象。它是第一个反映我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期工人阶级斗争生活的革命现代京剧，它是第一个描写社会主义社会里无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争的革命现代京剧，它是第一个歌颂中国工人阶级满怀国际主义豪情，支援世界革命人民反帝反修斗争的革命现代京剧。《海港》的成功演出，开创了京剧表现社会主义现实生活的广阔的道路。
    毛主席早在二十五年前就给我们指出了文艺为工农兵服务的大方向。二十五年来，毛主席的革命文艺路线与党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派所支持的反革命修正主义文艺黑线斗争的焦点，就是文艺为哪一个阶级服务，为哪一个阶级的政治服务。表现在戏剧领域里，就是无产阶级占领舞台还是资产阶级占领舞台。在毛主席革命文艺路线的指引下，江青同志领导的京剧革命、芭蕾舞革命、交响乐革命，把戏剧舞台上颠倒了的历史重新颠倒了过来，开创了工农兵占领戏剧舞台的历史新纪元。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！
    《海港》描写的是一九六三年上海港湾龙腾虎跃、风云翻滚的战斗生活。剧本通过上海港码头工人突出政治，胜利完成援外任务的故事，展示了社会主义革命时期意识形态领域里的一场激烈的阶级斗争，表现了社会主义时代的工人阶级以毛泽东思想为强大武器，向资产阶级思想和一切剥削阶级的意识形态发动进攻，把无产阶级革命进行到底的彻底革命精神。
    毛主席教导我们：社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段，在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。在无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，归根到底，是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。这种复辟与反复辟的斗争特别突出地反映在意识形态领域里。
    在革命京剧《海港》的舞台上，没有枪声，没有厮杀，没有阴森可怖、脚镣作响的刑场，但是，社会主义的海港并不是风平浪静的，这里不仅有自然界的狂波巨澜，而且时时震荡着阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪。《海港》描写的散包事件，就是意识形态领域里阶级斗争的一朵浪花。解放前的栈房先生、留用仓库员钱守维，时时刻刻留恋他那失去的“天堂”，他在码头不仅撒下了玻璃纤维，而且随时随地在散布资产阶级思想的香风毒雾，什么“臭苦力见人矮三分”、“八小时以外是你的自由”；甚至诬蔑码头工人：“靠咱们这号人，还能管好码头”。青年工人韩小强就是在钱守维之流的资产阶级思想毒害下，轻视码头工作，以致发生散包错包事故，甚至发展到摔掉工作证，离开码头。这难道不是意识形态领域里一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争吗？剧中的钱守维时时处处用资产阶级思想腐蚀无产阶级队伍，为资本主义复辟制造舆论，这就是中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图篡党、篡政、篡军，颠覆无产阶级专政的社会基础。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子就是钱守维这些资产阶级分子阶级利益的代表者。《海港》比较深刻地描写了一场无产阶级专政下意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，描写了一场两个阶级争夺接班人的斗争。
    《海港》不仅反映了阶级斗争，而且着重描写了社会主义时代的工人阶级在反复辟斗争中的主动地位和必然胜利。列宁说过：“只有承认阶级斗争、同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”在今天，只有承认无产阶级专政，同时又承认在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，还存在着复辟和反复辟的斗争，存在着无产阶级为保卫无产阶级专政，资产阶级为推翻无产阶级专政而进行的斗争，才是一个真正的马克思主义者。《海港》中的方海珍和高志扬就是这样的马克思主义者。他们能识破资产阶级的任何妖风毒雾，他们经得起一切阶级斗争风浪的考验。支部书记方海珍时时处处突出政治，念念不忘毛主席关于社会主义社会存在阶级和阶级斗争的教导，不论在惊涛骇浪面前或是在香风毒雾面前，她都把自己火热的阶级感情和昂扬的战斗情怀凝集在阶级斗争这根主弦上。她以阶级斗争的观点去观察、分析、解决一切问题，表现了特殊的政治敏感。码头上发生散包错包事故，她立即想到“思想散了，包才散；思想错了，包才错。”钱守维在码头上撒下了玻璃纤维，方海珍敏锐地觉察到“更严重的是，他还撒了许多不容易看见的资产阶级思想。”在散包、错包事故、请调报告接踵而来的错综复杂的情况下，方海珍胸有成竹，紧紧扣住了“抓生产怎能忘政治先行”，“征途上处处有阶级斗争”这条主线。她对钱守维一针见血地指出：“数字清点过了，可是思想也要清点清点啊！”对韩小强则是充满了深厚的阶级感情，无微不至地关怀他，耐心细致地帮助教育他。她的思想工作，是放在无产阶级和资产阶级争夺自己的接班人的斗争这一高度上进行的。她以强烈的阶级爱憎、动人的阶级斗争经历和远大的共产主义理想教育了韩小强，使韩小强终于认识到自己的错误，立志坚决听毛主席的话，革命到底，彻底粉碎了钱守维之流腐蚀青年、妄图复辟的阴谋。
    剧本雄辩地论证了用毛泽东思想武装起来的六十年代的中国工人阶级，不仅能够从资产阶级手里夺取政权，而且能够牢牢地掌握无产阶级政权，向资产阶级及一切剥削阶级思想进行斗争，使社会主义的红色江山千秋万代永不变色，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全世界。让中国的赫鲁晓夫的资本主义复辟迷梦连同他的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的破烂货一起见鬼去吧！
    毛主席说，必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。中国的工人阶级不仅是国内三大革命运动的闯将，而且是伟大的国际主义者。中国革命人民永远与世界革命人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，坚决支援他们的反帝反修斗争，誓做他们的坚强后盾。《海港》以歌颂国际主义精神为主题，第一次在京剧舞台上展现了社会主义时代中国工人阶级胸怀祖国，放眼世界，支援世界革命人民反帝反修斗争的豪情壮志。
    中国的码头工人在解放前深受“三座大山”的压迫，方海珍、高志扬、马洪亮他们对帝国主义、国民党反动派的仇恨远比黄浦江的水深。在党的领导下，他们得到了翻身解放，但是他们并没有忘记世界上三分之二的人民还在过着水深火热的生活。他们对世界被压迫民族的阶级兄弟，怀着一种何等深厚的阶级感情啊！他们遵循毛主席的教导：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争”，把自己平凡的搬运工作看作是支援世界革命的国际主义义务。在他们眼里，“这一包一件，紧连着世界风云。”高志扬小组为了提前完成援外任务，干劲冲天，突击抢运，机械不够，就用肩膀扛。发现散包事故以后，高志扬心似刀割，不顾自己孩子重病在家，立刻集合全组追根寻源，坚决连夜翻仓，一丝不苟地把两千包小麦逐一清查。后来发觉散包小麦已错当大米装上驳船开往吴淞，在万分紧迫的情势下，他又不顾雷雨交加，潮涌夜深，浪骇涛险，毅然登上汽艇，冒险出江追舟，终于调回麦包，胜利完成了援外任务。《海港》满怀激情地歌颂了社会主义时代中国工人阶级立足码头、胸怀祖国、放眼世界的国际主义豪情壮志，表现了“全世界闹革命风起云涌，觉醒的人民仰望北京；毛泽东思想东风传送，五大洲响彻了进军号角”的壮丽现实，展示了共产主义必将在全世界取得彻底胜利的灿烂前景。
    对待民族解放运动的态度是区分真马克思主义者和假马克思主义者的分水岭。民族斗争归根结底是个阶级斗争。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派跟赫鲁晓夫同声相应，同气相求，大力鼓吹“三和一少”的谬论，说什么对帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派要和，对民族解放斗争的国家支援要少，真是一副道道地地的背叛马列主义，背叛无产阶级革命，背叛世界革命人民的利益，投降帝国主义的叛徒嘴脸。《海港》的演出是对这种修正主义谬论的有力驳斥；《海港》的演出直接鼓舞了当前世界革命人民反帝反修斗争的斗志，有利于“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗”的大搏斗；《海港》的演出开拓了中国的无产阶级文艺为中国革命人民服务、为世界革命人民服务的途径。
    《海港》是一首社会主义时代工人阶级英雄的赞歌；是一曲阶级斗争的凯歌；是一章无产阶级国际主义的颂歌。一句话，《海港》是一首毛泽东思想的伟大战歌。我们说：《海港》好得很，就是好！
    革命现代京剧《海港》的成功演出，是文艺领域里无产阶级夺权斗争的伟大胜利，这是京剧革命中令人振奋鼓舞的一件大事。我们热烈欢呼这一伟大的胜利。让我们高举起革命的批判旗帜，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其支持的反革命修正主义文艺黑线批倒、批臭、批垮，把文艺阵地的领导权牢牢地夺到无产阶级手里，创作出更多更好的反映建国以来现实生活的革命现代京剧！（附图片）
