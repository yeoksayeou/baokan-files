The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong launched a frenzied attack on our patriotic organization, the Silver Theatre, on the night of June 9. This is a significant sign that the British authorities in Hong Kong are launching a full-scale attack on our patriotic organizations.

On the night of June 9, while the Silver Theatre in Kowloon was screening the domestic film "The Little Hero of Guerrilla Warfare" (also known as "Little Soldier Zhang Ga"), around 11 PM, as the audience was leaving after the movie, spies mixed among the crowd suddenly drew their guns and threatened the gatekeepers, preventing them from closing the door. Immediately, a large number of British fascist police and spies who had been lying in wait outside the cinema rushed into the cinema's lobby, balcony, projection room, and other areas. They used axes and crowbars to smash through an iron door and a wooden door, entering the office. The fascist thugs used their gun butts to randomly beat people and wielded batons, attacking and arresting anyone they saw. Some staff members were surrounded and beaten by more than ten thugs, with blood splattered all over the ground. Two staff members were beaten so severely that they were covered in blood and lay unconscious on the ground. A total of twenty-six staff members were illegally arrested.

The fascist bandits went to extreme lengths in their search of the cinema, using their gun butts to smash a bust of Chairman Mao in the projection room and tearing down the quotations from Chairman Mao and slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and many other slogans and banners. This is a grave insult to our great leader, Chairman Mao. To cover up the anti-China crimes of the British authorities in Hong Kong, the thugs sneaked away with the broken pieces of the bust. These fascist thugs also destroyed the cinema's furniture and stole a batch of banners, loudspeakers, and tape recorders from the cinema. The British fascist bandits left the scene at around 1:30 AM on June 10, howling as they departed.

    港英法西斯暴徒野蛮袭击我银都戏院
    据新华社香港十日电　港英法西斯当局，九日晚又疯狂进攻我爱国机构银都戏院。这是港英当局向我爱国机构发动全面进攻的一个重要讯号。
    九日晚上，九龙的银都戏院正在放映国产故事片《游击小英雄》（即《小兵张嘎》）。十一时许，当观众看完电影离场时，混在观众中的特务突然拔枪指吓守门的职工，不让关门。接着，大批预先埋伏在电影院外的港英法西斯警察和特务，冲进电影院的大厅、楼座、放映室等地方，并用带来的利斧和鹤嘴锄毁坏一道铁门和一道木门，冲进办公室。法西斯暴徒用枪托乱撞，并且挥舞警棍，逢人就打，见人就抓。有些职工被十几个暴徒围住毒打，鲜血洒了满地。有两名职工被打得满身鲜血，重伤昏迷倒地。有二十六名职工被非法逮捕。
    法西斯强盗在电影院内进行全面搜查时疯狂到极点，竟用枪托把陈列在放映室的毛主席塑像打碎，撕毁院内张贴的毛主席语录，以及写着“毛主席万岁！”的标语和其他许多标语、口号。这是对我们伟大领袖毛主席的严重侮辱。为了掩盖港英当局的反华罪行，暴徒们鬼鬼祟祟地把打碎的塑像磁片用袋装走。这些法西斯暴徒还捣毁院内的家具，劫走电影院的一批标语和扩音器、录音机等物件。港英法西斯强盗行凶至十日凌晨一时三十分才呼啸离去。
