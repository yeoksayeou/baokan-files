	Regulations of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee on Several Systems

	1. Regarding the works of Chairman Mao, they must be studied daily and applied in all matters. One hour before work each day and on Wednesday and Saturday mornings, study the works of Chairman Mao. During these study times, no meetings, office work, or receptions are to be held; this schedule is unchangeable. Leading cadres must take the lead in studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao, and must prioritize organizing and leading the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in all work.

	2. Members of the Revolutionary Committee must frequently go deep into the grassroots, get close to the masses; must set aside time to personally receive visits from the masses and handle letters from the people; must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and willingly accept supervision from the masses. As Comrade Lin Biao said, "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution," and must frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially welcoming criticism from revolutionary masses. We must not vaguely label the well-intentioned criticisms of revolutionary masses towards the Revolutionary Committee or its members as "attacking the headquarters of the proletariat."

	3. Seriously implement political, economic, military, and life democracy. Continue to promote the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, do, and rebel. Use the methods of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions. Each group should hold a democratic life meeting once a month; each committee (office) should hold a democratic meeting once every quarter; and a democratic meeting of the Revolutionary Committee should be held every half year. Regularly conduct small-scale rectification campaigns.

	4. Staff of the Revolutionary Committee, especially leading cadres at all levels, must regularly ensure that one-third of the personnel go to the countryside and factories to participate in collective production; one-third go deep into the grassroots to conduct investigations, research, inspect work, and summarize experiences; and one-third handle daily work in the office. The three groups should rotate regularly.

	5. It is prohibited to praise the Revolutionary Committee members. The Revolutionary Committee shall not hold ceremonial receptions; shall not take photos or make films casually, nor publish news about the general work activities of leaders or their personal photos in newspapers and magazines; when Revolutionary Committee members go out, they should not be greeted or sent off, and when they participate in mass rallies, they should not be applauded; important reports and speeches by members and responsible persons of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and its committees should generally be discussed collectively and should not be recorded, printed, or disseminated without organizational approval; all personnel of the Revolutionary Committee should address each other as comrades and should not use titles.

	6. Major political, economic, and military issues and matters concerning the entire province should be discussed and decided by the Standing Committee or the full meeting of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee; important work issues should be discussed and decided by the relevant committees. Individuals should not decide major issues, and without the approval of the Revolutionary Committee, they should not make statements to the outside world in the name of the organization.

	7. Strictly control the establishment of organizations, documents, meetings, publications, and reports. Temporary offices should not be set up without the approval of the Revolutionary Committee.

	8. Seriously implement and execute the central government's regulations on secrecy and should not divulge state secrets.

	9. The office should not have servants, and cadres should take turns cleaning; the Standing Committee should not have a dedicated secretary.

	10. Promote a frugal and plain lifestyle, oppose extravagance and waste, and do not engage in special treatment. Do not entertain or give gifts in the name of the office or individuals, nor accept gifts from others; do not purchase new equipment; do not use public cars for personal matters, and when using cars for official business, be mindful of saving.

    黑龙江省革命委员会关于若干制度的规定
    一、对于毛主席著作，要天天学，事事用。每日工作前一小时与星期三、六上午学习毛主席著作，学习时间不开会、不办公、不会客，雷打不动。领导干部必须带头学，带头用，要把组织领导活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。
    二、革命委员会的成员，要经常深入基层，接近群众；要拿出一定时间，亲自接待群众来访，处理人民来信；要虚心听取群众意见，自觉接受群众监督。要象林彪同志说的那样：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”，经常地开展批评与自我批评，特别要欢迎来自革命群众的批评，绝不能把革命群众对革命委员会或对某个成员的善意批评，笼统地说成是“炮打无产阶级司令部”。
    三、认真实行政治、经济、军事、生活四大民主。继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢造反的革命精神，坚持运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，各组每月开一次民主生活会；各委（室）每季度开一次民主大会；每半年召开一次革命委员会机关民主大会。定期进行小整风。
    四、革命委员会机关工作人员，特别是各级领导干部，要经常保持有三分之一的人下乡下厂，参加集体生产劳动；三分之一的人深入基层，调查研究，检查工作，总结经验；三分之一的人在机关处理日常工作。三班定期轮换。
    五、禁止给革命委员会成员歌功颂德。革命委员会，一律不搞仪式性“接见”；不随便照相、拍电影，不在报刊上登载领导人一般工作活动的消息和个人照片；对革命委员会成员，外出不要迎送，参加群众集会不要鼓掌；省革命委员会委员、常委和各委员会负责人的重要报告、讲话，一般都要经过集体讨论，不经组织同意，不得录音，不得印发，不得外传；革命委员会的所有人员，一律以同志相称，不许称呼“官衔”。
    六、各项重大的政治、经济、军事问题和有关全省人民的大事，都要由常务委员会或省革命委员会全体会议讨论决定；各项重要工作问题，都要经各有关委员会讨论决定。个人不得决定重大问题，未经革命委员会批准，不得以组织的名义对外表态。
    七、严格控制机构编制、文件、会议、刊物、报表。不经革命委员会批准，不得设置临时办公室。
    八、认真贯彻执行中央有关保密规定，不得泄露国家机密。
    九、机关不设服务员，干部轮流打扫卫生；常务委员不配专职秘书。
    十、发扬艰苦朴素作风，反对铺张浪费，不搞特殊化。不得以机关或个人名义请客送礼，也不得接受别人礼物；不购置新设备；私事不用公家汽车，因公坐车也要注意节约。
