The news of the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb has greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country. People are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiastically celebrating the boundless victory of Mao Zedong Thought and another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

From the coast of the East China Sea to the south of the Tian Shan Mountains, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, from the heart of the nation, Beijing, to cities and countryside across the country, everywhere is a scene of jubilation. People are spreading the good news everywhere: "The wise predictions and great calls of our great leader Chairman Mao have been realized!" People are shouting with all their might the same earth-shaking slogan: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

In many cities, the main streets and tall buildings are covered with big red posters and large character slogans celebrating the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb. In many places, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses carry giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, hold up red flags, and beat drums and gongs as they march through the streets, enthusiastically celebrating the entry of China's nuclear weapons into a new stage. People unanimously point out: The successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb has greatly boosted the morale of China's revolutionary cadres, and has greatly dashed the arrogance of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party; it has greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary people worldwide, and has greatly dashed the arrogance of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Today, the entire city of Beijing is still immersed in boundless joy. The reception stands of the Party Central Committee and the State Council are the center of the city's joy. From early morning until late at night, it is always crowded with people. People, with hearts burning hotter than the June sun, carry giant portraits of Chairman Mao, hold up bright red flags, and carry the shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surging from all directions towards the reception stands of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, sending one enthusiastic letter of congratulations after another to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. In their letters of congratulations, they unanimously point out: The successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb marks the entry of China's nuclear weapons into a new stage. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They express their determination to follow the revolutionary course charted by Chairman Mao, to overcome all difficulties, and to march from victory to victory!

In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, and in cities like Taiyuan, Harbin, Jinan, and Guiyang, today is a day of drumming and cheering, with teams of people bringing the good news surging towards the revolutionary committees of the provinces and municipalities, celebrating this great new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Red Guards of Shanghai No. 6 Middle School, who have achieved great unity through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, point out that the successful hydrogen bomb test has once again greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of revolutionary people worldwide. It is a heavy blow to U.S. and British imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. We, the Red Guards who have grown up through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the People's Liberation Army, strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and highhold the great banner of criticism. We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary masses said, another leap in China's nuclear weapons development has further broken the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and dealt a heavy blow to their nuclear blackmail. This is also a fatal blow to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who dare to invade the mainland.

In the city of Xining on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, over 50,000 people, including revolutionary cadres and soldiers of the August 18th Revolutionary Rebellion Group and the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, held a grand meeting today, enthusiastically celebrating another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

According to the Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, the good news spread everywhere, and the whole country sang in unison. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces enthusiastically celebrated the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb, singing joyfully about the wise foresight and great calls of our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, being realized. They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" thousands of times.

The great news of the hydrogen bomb test's success spread everywhere, bringing joy everywhere. In military camps, air force bases, and naval docks, from morning to night, the sound of drums and cheers filled the sky. The soldiers of the land, sea, and air forces were immersed in boundless excitement and joy.

The sentries at Tiananmen Square, upon hearing the good news, shouted joyfully and sang enthusiastically. The soldiers of a certain air force squadron who are on duty day and night to guard the capital pointed out that the fact of the successful explosion of China's hydrogen bomb makes us see more clearly the boundless power of the spiritual atomic bomb—Mao Zedong Thought. We shout "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" a thousand times, ten thousand times!

In the southwestern border region, broad masses of soldiers and ethnic minorities in the border region sang loudly and danced hand in hand, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" time and time again, and wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!

The good news reached the position of the anti-aircraft artillery company of a certain unit on Hainan Island. After the celebration meeting, the soldiers immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and went to the nearby countryside in the early morning to spread the victory news to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, sharing the joy.

The soldiers guarding the southeastern coast, upon hearing the good news, were so moved that they had tears in their eyes, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The broad masses of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai, Jinan, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Qinghai, when celebrating the victory with the local revolutionary cadres, said excitedly, with Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything. The great Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and bravest, and can create any miracle. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle of all our work and the fundamental guarantee of victory.

The soldiers of various units expressed at the celebration meetings and discussion meetings that they would definitely learn from all the comrades who participated in the nuclear test, highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to achieve new merits for the people in defending national defense, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and completing the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries."
