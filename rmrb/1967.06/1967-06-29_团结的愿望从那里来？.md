Do we have the desire to unite with cadres who have made mistakes and with the masses who have been deceived? This is the prerequisite for doing a good job in uniting and educating people.

After the "January Revolution" storm, because of our victory, some non-proletarian thoughts have grown in our revolutionary rebel ranks. They only believe in their own revolution and do not believe that others can revolutionize. Some comrades have a "three noes" attitude towards cadres who have made mistakes: first, they dare not approach them, fearing that others will say they are "rightist"; second, they do not want to approach them, fearing that they themselves will be implicated; third, they do not think about approaching them, believing that they are "diehard reactionaries." Under the guidance of these thoughts, they do not ask about or care for comrades who have made mistakes, and do not do any work with them.

Why do these thoughts arise? Through studying Chairman Mao's works, we have come to realize: the fundamental reason is the lack of a desire to unite with comrades who have made mistakes. Chairman Mao teaches us: "First of all, we must start from the desire for unity. Because if we do not have the desire for unity in our minds, a struggle will inevitably make things chaotic and uncontrollable. Isn't that 'ruthless struggle, merciless blows'? Where is the party's unity?" Where does the desire for unity come from? From this segment of our struggle practice, we have come to understand that we must solve the following three problems:

First, we must solve the problem of the "selfish" thoughts in the minds of revolutionary rebels. We deeply feel that to unite with the majority of cadres, the red rebels must cast aside the "selfish" thoughts and have the great ambition to liberate all mankind. If we have various selfish thoughts, we will not be able to do the work of uniting with the majority. Therefore, we organized the red rebels to study the "Three Articles." In the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao points out: "When confronted with a task, one first thinks of oneself and then of others.... Towards comrades and the people, one is not full of enthusiasm but cold and indifferent, indifferent and unconcerned. Such a person is actually not a Communist Party member, at least not a pure Communist Party member." By using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine our thoughts and actions, everyone realized: our not daring to, not wanting to, and not thinking about approaching comrades who have made mistakes is because of the "selfish" thoughts. When confronted with a task, one first thinks of oneself, fearing involvement, fearing getting stuck, fearing this and that, and actually throwing comrades who have made mistakes to one side. This is an irresponsible attitude towards comrades. Only by casting aside the "selfish" thoughts and getting rid of the "fear" can we actively do the ideological work of comrades who have made mistakes, from not daring to approach to daring to approach.

Second, we must solve the problem of our view of comrades who have made mistakes. If we do not have a correct view of comrades who have made mistakes, we will not be able to actively and boldly help them. With this problem in mind, we carefully studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao teaches us: "The nature of the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people is different, and the methods of resolving them are also different. To put it simply, the former is a matter of distinguishing between the enemy and us, and the latter is a matter of distinguishing right from wrong." We linked this to our actual situation and analyzed the situation in the original provincial committee office. We believe that the majority of cadres who have made mistakes have been poisoned and deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line. They themselves unconsciously made mistakes, which is a matter of ideological understanding, a contradiction among the people. Only by having a correct understanding of comrades who have made mistakes can we have the desire for unity and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, using democratic methods, discussion methods, criticism methods, and persuasion and education methods to actively do the political and ideological work of comrades who have made mistakes, helping them to quickly stand up and uniting with them to make revolution.

Third, we must solve the problem of our feelings towards comrades who have made mistakes. If we cannot get past this in our feelings, we will not have the sincere heart to help. Towards comrades who have made mistakes, we must see their positive side. The majority of them love Chairman Mao and the Party, and subjectively they all want to make revolution and are willing to get close to the revolutionary rebels. These comrades are all our class brothers. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." Everyone believes that towards class brothers who have made mistakes, we should feel pain and sadness, and absolutely not laugh at them from the sidelines; towards them, we should actively unite and help, and absolutely not exclude or attack. Only by changing our feelings towards comrades who have made mistakes can we, with deep class feelings, actively and enthusiastically help them correct their mistakes.

After solving the ideological problems, we dare to approach cadres who have made mistakes and are not afraid of "getting involved"; we dare to do the political and ideological work of cadres and are not afraid of being called "rightist." When we actively approached these comrades and did some ideological work, we found that these cadres are not "diehard reactionaries" at all. The vast majority of them are willing to correct their mistakes. After they recognized their mistakes, they quickly drew a clear line between themselves and the capitalist-roaders in the party and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Now, more than 95% of the cadres in the original provincial committee office have united with our Red Rebel Corps, united against the enemy, and fought together. In this way, we have maximally isolated the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, creating the conditions to thoroughly overthrow and expose them.

### 团结的愿望从那里来？

    团结的愿望从那里来？
    原黑龙江省委机关红色造反团　“全无敌”分团
    对待犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众有没有团结的愿望，是能否做好团结、教育工作的前提。
      “一月革命”风暴以后，因为胜利，在我们革命造反派中间，有些人的非无产阶级思想有了滋长。他们只相信自己革命，不大相信别人能够革命。有些同志对犯错误的干部存有“三不”思想：一是不敢接近，怕别人说“右倾”；二是不愿接近，怕自己受牵连；三是不想接近，认为他们“死顽固”。在这种思想指导下，对犯错误的同志不问不理，根本不去做工作。
    为什么会产生这些思想呢？经过学习毛主席著作，我们认识到：最根本的原因是，对犯错误的同志缺乏团结的愿望。毛主席教导我们：“首先需要从团结的愿望出发。因为如果在主观上没有团结的愿望，一斗势必把事情斗乱，不可收拾，那还不是‘残酷斗争，无情打击’？那还有什么党的团结？”团结的愿望究竟从那里来？我们从这一段斗争实践中体会到，必须解决以下三个问题：
    首先，解决革命造反派头脑里的“私”字。我们深深体会到，要想团结干部的大多数，红色造反者要抛开“私”字，要有解放全人类的伟大胸怀。如果有各种私心杂念，就不可能去做争取团结大多数人的工作。因此，我们组织红色造反者学习了“老三篇”。毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中指出：“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。……对同志对人民不是满腔热忱，而是冷冷清清，漠不关心，麻木不仁。这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”用毛主席的教导来对照检查我们的思想行动，大家认识到：我们对待犯错误的同志不敢接近、不愿接近、不想接近，就是“私”字在作怪。一事当前，先考虑个人，怕沾边，怕陷进去，怕这怕那，竟把犯错误的同志扔到一边，这是对同志不负责任的表现。只有抛开“私”字，甩掉“怕”字，才能主动地做犯错误干部的思想工作，由不敢接近到敢于接近。
    第二，解决对犯错误同志的看法问题。对犯了错误的同志没有正确看法，就不可能主动大胆地去帮。带着这个问题，我们认真地学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，毛主席教导我们：“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”我们联系实际，分析了原省委办公厅的情况，认为犯错误的干部绝大多数是受资产阶级反动路线的毒害和蒙蔽，他们自己犯错误是不自觉的，是属于思想认识问题，是人民内部矛盾。只有对犯错误同志有了正确认识，才能有团结的愿望，坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，用民主的方法、讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法，去积极做犯错误同志的政治思想工作，帮助他们很快站起来，团结他们一道闹革命。
    第三，解决对犯错误同志的思想感情问题。如果在思想感情上通不过，就不可能有帮助的诚心。对犯了错误的同志，我们要看到他积极的一面。他们绝大多数是热爱毛主席、热爱党的，从主观上他们都是要革命的，愿意同革命造反派接近的。这些同志都是我们的阶级弟兄。毛主席教导我们说：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”大家认为，对阶级弟兄犯了错误，应该感到痛心、难过，绝不能在一旁看笑话；对他们应该主动团结帮助，绝不能排斥、打击。对犯错误同志在思想感情上有了转变，才能怀着深厚的阶级感情，去积极热情地帮助他们改正错误。
    思想问题解决了，我们就敢于接近犯错误的干部，不怕“沾边”了；敢于做干部的政治思想工作，不怕别人说“右倾”了。当我们主动接近这些同志，做了一些思想工作以后，发现这些干部并不是什么“死顽固”。他们绝大部分是愿意改正自己的错误的。他们认识自己错误以后，很快就和党内走资本主义道路当权派划清了界线，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。现在，原省委办公厅内百分之九十五以上的干部，都团结在我们红色造反团的周围，一致对敌，共同战斗。这样，我们就最大限度地孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为彻底斗倒、批臭他们创造了条件。
