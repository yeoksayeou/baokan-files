On June 5, the American imperialists' lackey Israel launched a large-scale air and ground attack on the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other countries, brazenly initiating an invasion of the Arab states. Thus, the recent threats of war by the American imperialists using Israel against the Arab people have turned into actual military actions, and the American imperialists and their lackeys have imposed war on the Arab people.

Since the American imperialists and their lackeys have launched an invasion, the Arab people must resolutely rise up to wage an anti-aggression war. If the enemy attacks, we must resolutely fight back. Currently, the military and people of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other countries are delivering a crushing blow to the invaders. Arab countries are united in their hatred of the enemy and have successively declared a state of war with Israel. The armies of many Arab countries have been dispatched to the front lines to jointly resist the invasion. This is the most powerful and resolute response of the 100 million Arab people to the aggressors.

Israel's reckless invasion of Arab countries is a product of American imperialism. In recent days, ships from the U.S. Sixth Fleet have sailed to the eastern Mediterranean, threatening Arab countries. Johnson issued three statements in one week, declaring that the U.S. would "fulfill" its "promises" to Israel. The U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Republic had previously threatened to "use force" against Arab countries. The invasion of the Middle East by Israel is, in reality, a war in which the U.S. provides the weapons and strategies, while Israel provides the troops to fight on behalf of the U.S., slaughtering the Arab people. The purpose of the American imperialists in instigating this invasion is to attempt to suppress the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Arab people, in order to control and enslave the various Arab countries.

British imperialism is also a co-conspirator in this invasion. Recently, Britain has followed the U.S. in repeatedly issuing war threats to Arab countries, while continuously amassing military forces east of the Suez Canal. Wilson even publicly declared that if Arab countries do not surrender to Israel, there will be "a local war in the Middle East." The British imperialists, who suffered a humiliating defeat in the Suez Canal War, are attempting to regain their dominance over the Arab people through this new invasion.

In the criminal invasion activities of the U.S. and its lackey Israel, the Soviet revisionist leadership group has once again played the shameful role of the chief accomplice. Recently, there has been frequent communication between Moscow, Washington, and London, with close collaboration. A large number of Soviet ships have sailed to the eastern Mediterranean, sailing side by side with the U.S. Sixth Fleet. Khrushchev feigned writing a letter to the Israeli prime minister, advising him to "act cautiously," which even Israeli officials found unusually "mild." The Soviet revisionist group is determined to collude with American and British imperialism to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's just struggle. Their treacherous actions greatly encourage Israel's aggressive ambitions.

The invasion by the American imperialists' lackey Israel is, in fact, a continuation of American imperialism's policy of neo-colonialist enslavement of Arab countries. The U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union are colluding to force Arab countries to submit through war. While they instigate war, they also manipulate the United Nations to "mediate," continuing to implement big-power interference. This exposes the United Nations as a tool of American imperialism, a tool of colonialism, a tool of big-power politics, and a tool for political deception to cover up war crimes.

The American imperialists and their accomplices and lackeys are absolutely intolerable in their bullying of the Arab people. The Arab people are a brave people with a tradition of anti-aggression struggle. They will not bow down to imperialist bandits. In 1956 and 1958, they gave a resolute response to the invasions of American and British imperialism. Today, the Arab people are more united and stronger. They will definitely give the aggressors double the punishment and double the blow!

Chairman Mao said: "If they want to fight, we will annihilate them thoroughly. The matter is like this: they come to attack, and we annihilate them, then they will feel comfortable. Annihilate a bit, feel a bit comfortable; annihilate more, feel more comfortable; annihilate thoroughly, feel thoroughly comfortable." The Arab people should deal with imperialism and its lackeys in this way.

The current world situation is very favorable for the Arab people's anti-aggression war. American imperialism has been beaten black and blue by the Vietnamese people and is stuck in the Vietnam battlefield, unable to extricate itself. It is launching invasions everywhere and getting beaten everywhere. Its situation is very passive and full of difficulties. It appears fierce in front of the Arab people, but in reality, it is extremely weak. The American imperialists and their tool Israel are most afraid of the Arab people persisting in this anti-aggression war. As long as the people of the various Arab countries further recognize the reactionary nature of American imperialism and its accomplices, strengthen unity, persist in the struggle, fear no threats, and are not deceived, they will definitely achieve the final victory in the just anti-aggression self-defense war.

The 700 million Chinese people strongly condemn the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism is a common enemy of the Chinese and Arab peoples. The Chinese people resolutely stand with the Arab people and resolutely support the Arab people's anti-aggression war.

American imperialism and its lackeys will surely be defeated! The Arab people will surely be victorious!

### 坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争

    坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争
    六月五日，美帝国主义走狗以色列对阿联、叙利亚等国进行大规模的空中和地面袭击，悍然发动了对阿拉伯国家的侵略战争。这样，最近期间美帝国主义利用以色列对阿拉伯人民所进行的战争威胁就变成了战争行动，美帝国主义及其走狗就把战争强加在阿拉伯人民的头上。
    既然美帝国主义及其走狗已经发动了侵略战争，阿拉伯人民当然就要坚决地起来进行反侵略战争。敌人既然打了过来，那就要坚决打回去。目前，阿联、叙利亚等国军民正在给入侵者以迎头痛击。阿拉伯国家同仇敌忾，纷纷宣布同以色列进入战争状态。许多阿拉伯国家的军队已陆续开往前线，共同反抗侵略。这是一亿阿拉伯人民对侵略者的最有力、最坚定的回答。
    以色列发动对阿拉伯国家的猖狂侵略，是美帝国主义一手制造的。这几天来，美国第六舰队的舰只开到东地中海，向阿拉伯国家进行威胁。约翰逊在一个星期内三次发表声明，叫嚷美国要“履行”它对以色列的“诺言”。美国驻阿联大使早就扬言，要对阿拉伯国家“使用武力”。以色列在中东发动的这场侵略战争，实际上是一场由美国出枪，出主意，由以色列出人，替美国打仗，屠杀阿拉伯人的战争。美帝国主义制造这场侵略战争的目的，是妄图镇压阿拉伯人民的反帝革命斗争，以便控制和奴役阿拉伯各国。
    英帝国主义也是这场侵略战争的一个同谋者。最近以来，英国一面追随美国一再地向阿拉伯国家发出战争威胁，一面不断向苏伊士运河以东集结军事力量。威尔逊并公开叫嚣，阿拉伯国家如果不向以色列屈服，就将“在中东引起一场局部战争”。在苏伊士运河战争中遭到惨败的英帝国主义，妄想通过这场新的侵略战争，重新骑到阿拉伯人民的头上。
    在美国和它的走狗以色列的罪恶侵略活动中，苏联修正主义领导集团又一次扮演了头号帮凶的可耻角色。最近，莫斯科、华盛顿和伦敦之间，来往频繁，勾搭得十分紧密。苏联的大批舰只开赴东地中海，和美国的第六舰队并肩航行，打得火热。柯西金装模作样地写信给以色列总理，劝他“谨慎”行事，就连以色列的官员也感到异乎寻常的“温和”。苏修集团一心一意要伙同美、英帝国主义，把阿拉伯人民正义斗争的烈火扑灭下去。他们的这种叛卖勾当，大大地鼓励了以色列的侵略凶焰。
    美帝国主义走狗以色列发动的侵略战争，实际上是美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家推行新殖民主义奴役政策的继续。美英苏勾结一起，妄图用战争手段迫使阿拉伯国家屈服。它们一面挑起战争，一面又操纵联合国出面“调停”，继续实行大国干涉。这就赤裸裸地暴露了联合国是美帝国主义的工具，是殖民主义的工具，是大国强权政治的工具，是它们掩盖战争罪行进行政治欺骗的工具。
    美帝国主义及其帮凶、走狗，如此欺侮阿拉伯人民，这是绝对不能容忍的。阿拉伯人民是具有反侵略斗争传统的英勇的人民，他们在帝国主义强盗面前，绝不会低头。一九五六年和一九五八年，他们就曾对美英帝国主义的侵略，给予了坚决的反击。今天，阿拉伯人民是更加团结，更加强大了。他们一定要给侵略者以加倍的惩罚，加倍的打击！
    毛主席说：“如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”阿拉伯人民对付帝国主义及其走狗，就要用这个办法。
    当前的世界形势对阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争，是十分有利的。美帝国主义已经被越南人民打得鼻青眼肿，陷在越南战场上不得脱身。它在世界各地到处发动侵略，到处挨打。它的处境十分被动，困难重重。它在阿拉伯人民面前，好象凶得很，其实极其虚弱。美帝国主义及其工具以色列，最害怕的是阿拉伯各国人民坚持这场反侵略战争。只要阿拉伯各国人民进一步认清美帝国主义及其同伙的反动本质，加强团结，坚持战斗，不怕威吓，不受欺骗，那么，就一定能够取得正义的反侵略自卫战争的最后胜利。
    七亿中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略罪行。美帝国主义是中国和阿拉伯人民的共同死敌。中国人民坚决同阿拉伯人民站在一起，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争。
    美帝国主义及其走狗必败！阿拉伯人民必胜！
