	The revolutionary comrades of the Fukagawa branch of the Japanese Communist Party's Fukagawa Town, Saitama Prefecture, recently issued a statement calling on party members nationwide to fight against the revisionist elements within the JCP, to expose their crimes, and to seize power from them, advancing along the brilliant path illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought.

	The statement severely condemns the revisionist elements within the JCP, stating, "Since last year, they have colluded with the Soviet revisionist clique to pursue an anti-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-China line. They attempt to drag the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people into the parliamentary quagmire. Recently, they have even gone so far as to openly advocate for the possibility of obtaining an absolute majority in parliament to legally establish a united front government against American imperialism and Japanese monopolistic capitalism. Such advocacy is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism and is a betrayal of the Japanese people."

	The statement points out that the JCP revisionist elements fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, even aligning with American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, the Japanese reactionaries, and the capitalist-roaders in power within the Chinese Communist Party to take "united action."

	The statement emphasizes that the task of true communists and revolutionary people is to expose the crimes of the traitors, create public opinion, and engage in struggle. "We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Anything reactionary is sure to perish. This is an inexorable law. All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful.' We must not fear difficulties and carry the struggle through to the end."

	The statement condemns the revisionists' argument that "even if there are differences in line, discipline should be followed." "This is a shackle that binds the hands and feet of communists, forcing the implementation of a counter-revolutionary line. This is precisely the thought of 'cultivation,' which must be resolutely smashed."

	The statement concludes, "Our strength is still small. However, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we can grow from small to large and achieve final victory. We will advance with unshakable confidence along the path illuminated by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."

	Recently, revolutionary workers and peasants in the northern part of Nagano Prefecture, Japan, spoke to a reporter from the East Is Red News Agency, strongly condemning the JCP revisionist elements for betraying the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people and degenerating into "parliamentary fanatics."

	A farmer told the reporter, "The JCP revisionist elements have completely degenerated into patients suffering from parliamentary disease. Their counter-revolutionary face was fully exposed during the local elections in April. They are only concerned with how to pull in more votes, completely disregarding the urgent needs of the broad masses of the people. They have completely abandoned the task of communists to stand at the forefront of the masses, organize the masses, and realize the demands of the masses."

	A poor worker said to the reporter, "Those revisionist elements shout slogans of revolution but actually engage in counter-revolutionary activities. They never stop shouting anti-American slogans, but in reality, they have completely abandoned the struggle against American imperialism."

	This poor worker was extremely indignant about the treacherous behavior of the JCP revisionist elements. During the April elections, he told a "Communist Party" candidate for the town council who came to his house, "You are no longer the vanguard of the proletariat. You are of no use."

	He said, "To oppose American imperialism, to oppose the Japanese reactionaries, and to carry the Japanese revolution through to the end, we must wage a resolute struggle against revisionism."

	An old revolutionary in this area quoted Chairman Mao's words to the reporter: "Revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by one class over another." He pointed out, "Revolution is about seizing power and cannot be achieved through the parliamentary road as advocated by the JCP revisionist elements. Japan has numerous American bases and tens of thousands of reactionary armed forces. Under these forces of bourgeois dictatorship, can the revolution be completed through peaceful means in parliament? The parliamentary system that 'parliamentary fanatics' boast about is merely a tool used by imperialism and the bourgeoisie to rule the people!"

	He said, "We must rely on the broad masses, expose the 'peaceful revolution' mask worn by the JCP revisionist elements, and begin all necessary preparations to complete the revolutionary cause of Japan."

    不许把日本人民革命斗争引向议会主义的泥坑
    日共革命派号召大造日修分子的反
    长野县革命工农群众说：日修分子的“和平革命”就是背叛革命
    新华社十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本共产党埼玉县福冈町福冈支部的革命同志，最近发表声明，呼吁全国的党员起来同日共修正主义分子进行斗争，造他们的反，夺他们的权，沿着毛泽东思想的光辉道路前进。
    声明严厉谴责日共的修正主义分子说，他们“从去年起同苏联修正主义集团串通一气，推行了反革命反人民反中国的路线。他们企图把日本人民的革命斗争引向议会主义的泥坑，最近竟发展到公开主张‘有可能在国会中取得绝对多数，合法地建立反对美帝国主义和日本垄断资本统治的统一战线政府’的地步。这样的主张是和马克思列宁主义格格不入的，是对日本人民的背叛。”
    声明指出，日共修正主义分子拚命反对毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命，竟同美帝国主义、苏联修正主义集团和日本反动派以及中国党内走资本主义道路的当权派采取“统一行动”。
    声明指出，真正的共产党人和革命人民的任务就是起来揭露叛徒的罪恶勾当，造成舆论，进行斗争。“我们一定要牢记毛泽东主席的教导：‘凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。’不怕困难，把斗争进行到底。”
    声明谴责了修正主义者的“即使路线上有分歧，也应该遵守纪律”的说法。“这是束缚共产党人的手脚，强制推行反革命路线的枷锁，这正是《修养》的思想，必须坚决砸烂。”
    声明最后说：“我们的力量还不大。但是，我们用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来，就能够从小到大，赢得最后胜利。我们将信心百倍地沿着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想所照亮的道路前进”。
    新华社十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：最近，日本长野县北部的山之内町的革命工农群众，向东方通讯社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责日共修正主义分子背叛了日本人民的革命事业，堕落成为反对革命的“议会迷”。
    一个农民向记者说：日共修正主义分子，“已经完全堕落成为一个得了议会主义病的患者。四月份举行的地方选举中，他们的反革命嘴脸已经暴露无遗。他们所关心和孜孜以求的是如何多拉一张选票，至于广大人民群众有什么迫切的要求，是根本不加过问的。他们现在已经完全抛弃了站在群众的前头、组织群众、实现群众要求的共产主义者的任务了。”
    一位贫穷的工人对记者说：“那些修正主义分子们，嘴上喊着革命的高调，实际上干着反对革命的勾当，他们反美口号不离嘴，可是实际上根本放弃了反美的斗争。”
    这位穷苦工人，对于日共修正主义分子的叛徒行为极为愤慨。他在四月的选举时曾对来到他家中的一个“共产党”的町议会候补议员说：“你们已经不是一个无产阶级的先锋队了，你们什么用也没有。”
    他说，“为了反对美帝国主义，反对日本反动派，把日本的革命进行到底，我们应当和修正主义展开坚决的斗争。”
    这个地方的一位老革命家向记者引用了毛主席的话：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”他指出：“革命就是要夺取政权，绝不能象日共修正主义分子所鼓吹的那样，说什么通过议会的道路就可以达到目的。日本有许许多多的美国基地，有几十万武装到牙齿的反动派的军队，在这些资产阶级专政力量之下，能够通过议会用和平的手段来完成革命吗？‘议会迷’们所吹嘘的议会制度不过是帝国主义、资产阶级用来统治人民群众的工具罢了！”
    他说：“我们应当依靠广大群众，撕开日共修正主义分子玩弄的‘和平革命’的假面具，为完成日本的革命事业，开始进行一切必要的准备工作。”
