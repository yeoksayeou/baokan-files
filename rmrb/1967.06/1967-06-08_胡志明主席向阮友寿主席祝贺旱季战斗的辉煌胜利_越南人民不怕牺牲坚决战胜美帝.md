Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently wrote a letter to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and all members of the Central Committee, extending the warmest congratulations on the brilliant victory achieved by the heroic military and people of South Vietnam in the dry season battles of last winter and this spring.

In his letter, Chairman Ho said that the great victory in this dry season battle is a victory of great strategic significance in the military and political struggle of the entire Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

The letter said that South Vietnam has achieved great victories, and North Vietnam has also achieved great victories. Both sides are fighting well, fighting more strongly, and fighting more victoriously.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "The enemy has suffered heavy defeats. But it is still obstinate. It will send more troops and adopt more barbaric and brutal means to continue its aggression in the South and to launch more fierce attacks on the North. It will also continue to spread the deceitful 'peace talks' to deceive American and world public opinion. However, no matter how many hundred thousand troops the U.S. bandits send, no matter how barbaric and cunning they are, they cannot save themselves from the passive situation and the quagmire in South Vietnam. The more they fight, the more heavily they will be defeated."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "Our people are advancing by leaps and bounds on the basis of victory. The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will face. But we are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices. To defend the independence and freedom of our motherland, we are determined to fight until we achieve complete victory."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "Our country is a whole, and our nation is a whole. The South and the North are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors. The 17 million people in the North are determined to keep their promise and fight shoulder to shoulder with the 14 million people in the South to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country."

In his concluding remarks, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "The U.S. imperialists will be defeated, and the Vietnamese people will be victorious!"

    胡志明主席向阮友寿主席祝贺旱季战斗的辉煌胜利  
    越南人民不怕牺牲坚决战胜美帝
    据新华社河内五日电 据这里报纸报道：越南民主共和国主席胡志明，最近写信给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿和中央委员会全体委员，最热烈的祝贺英雄的越南南方军民在去冬今春的旱季战斗中取得的辉煌胜利。
    胡主席在信中说，这次旱季战斗的巨大胜利，是越南全体人民“在抗美救国战争中，在军事和政治上取得的具有极其重大的战略意义的胜利”。
    信中说，越南南方取得了巨大胜利，越南北方也取得了巨大胜利。南北两方都打得好，越战越胜，越战越强。
    胡志明主席说：“敌人遭到了惨重的失败。但是，它还是顽固的。它将会增派军队，采取更加野蛮、残暴的手段，继续加强侵略南方的战争和更猛烈地袭击北方。它也将会继续散布欺诈的‘和平谈判’论调，妄图欺骗美国和世界舆论。但是，不管美国强盗增派几十万军队，不管它多么野蛮和狡猾，也无法挽救它在越南南方的被动和陷入泥潭的困境。它越打得大，就必定遭到越惨重的失败。”
    胡志明主席说：“我国人民正在胜利的基础上突飞猛进。越接近胜利，困难就越多。但是，我们决不怕艰苦和牺牲。为了保卫祖国的独立、自由，我们决心战斗到取得彻底胜利。”
    胡志明主席说：“我们国家是一个整体，我们民族是一个整体。南北两方共同下定决心，战胜美国侵略强盗。一千七百万北方同胞决心信守誓言，同一千四百万南方骨肉同胞并肩战斗，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。”
    胡志明主席在信中最后说，美帝国主义必败，越南人民必胜！
