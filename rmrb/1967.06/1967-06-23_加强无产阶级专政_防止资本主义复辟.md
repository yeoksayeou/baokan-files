Mao Zedong's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a brilliant, epoch-making work that creatively develops the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It proposes that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class struggle still exists, and it is necessary to continue to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in order to smash all the restoration plots of the bourgeoisie, to carry the socialist revolution to the end, and ultimately to defeat the bourgeoisie.

The proletarian revolution is the most extensive, profound, and thorough revolution in human history. For the proletariat, it is not enough to have a socialist revolution on the economic front; it is also not solid enough. It is necessary to carry out socialist revolutions on the political and ideological fronts. Otherwise, the final victory of socialism is impossible. In this struggle, class struggle in the ideological realm is extremely important. Because the class enemy always uses this position to stir up trouble and prepare public opinion for the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the restoration of capitalism.

Class struggle in the ideological realm is an important part of the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat to consolidate its power and the bourgeoisie to overthrow the proletariat's power.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental guarantee for our victory over the enemy on the political, economic, and ideological fronts. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Now, in the struggle in the realm of ideology, socialism has the conditions for victory. The basic force of the state power is in the hands of the laboring people under the leadership of the proletariat. The Communist Party has great power and very high prestige." The dictatorship of the proletariat is the magic weapon for us to win the class struggle in the realm of ideology. With the dictatorship of the proletariat, we can suppress the counter-revolutionary activities of domestic and foreign class enemies and protect the interests of the people; with the dictatorship of the proletariat, we can mobilize the masses on a wide scale, greatly develop socialist new culture, and more powerfully eliminate capitalist and feudal old culture; with the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is beneficial to use democratic methods within the people to educate ourselves and consciously transform ourselves, and to carry out the struggle to eliminate capitalist and promote communist ideology.

The unprecedented practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has taught us: the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental foundation, it is our lifeline. The proletariat, once it has its own state power, has everything; without state power, it loses everything. We must never be complacent about state power.

All class enemies fiercely attack and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party maliciously slanders that "the dictatorship of the proletariat also has its dark side, producing bureaucratism." He opposes talking about the dictatorship of the proletariat and wants to "make people feel that it is everyone's dictatorship." He is completely singing the tune of "the people's state" in the style of Khrushchev.

In his work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao, based on the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat at home and abroad, pointed out that the danger of the restoration of capitalism mainly comes from revisionism within the Party, and issued a call to the whole Party to criticize revisionism.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revisionism, or right opportunism, is a bourgeois ideology, and it is more dangerous than dogmatism. 'Revisionists blur the distinction between socialism and capitalism, blur the distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. What they advocate is not the socialist line in reality, but the capitalist line. Under the current situation, revisionism is more harmful than dogmatism. One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism."

The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie must be reflected within our Party. The counter-revolutionary revisionists are the agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, brazenly attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of the Communist Party, vigorously advocating capitalism, and opposing socialism.

Chairman Mao teaches us that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, is concentrated in the struggle between the proletariat and a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are the main targets of the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their contradiction with the proletariat is the main contradiction in the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, an antagonistic contradiction. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is mainly to solve this contradiction, to expose, overthrow, and denounce a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and to carry out the struggle to seize power from them.

We are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to consolidate the power of the proletariat and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat must implement dictatorship over the class enemy, and to do this, it must unite the revolutionary people firmly. To strengthen the unity of the proletariat, the organization and discipline of the proletariat are indispensable. Lenin said: "The main essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat lies in the organization and discipline of the advanced detachment of the laborers, the vanguard, the sole leader, the proletariat." The practical experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has told us: we must correctly handle the relationship between the democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline of the proletariat. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have enjoyed the maximum democracy and freedom. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "This freedom is a freedom under leadership, this democracy is a democracy under centralized guidance, not a state of anarchy." If we indulge in anarchism, reject the organization and discipline of the proletariat, it will only weaken our struggle against the class enemy and weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is contrary to the fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been able to develop so rapidly and achieve such brilliant victories because it has been carried out under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and under the correct leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution most eloquently proves: our country is a great country of the dictatorship of the proletariat; our Party is a great, glorious, and correct Party; for the past seventeen years, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in the dominant position within our Party, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, not the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, has been in the dominant position in our country. These are all things that must be completely affirmed.

Some people cannot see the essence of things, cannot distinguish between the main trend and the secondary trend, and have a tendency to deny everything in the past one-sidedly, proposing slogans such as "thoroughly improving the dictatorship of the proletariat." This is wrong. Because the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country has already taken the dominant position, the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are only a handful of people, and only some parts of the proletarian state power have been usurped by them, not the whole. Some people with ulterior motives distort the facts and attempt to thoroughly deny everything in the past. Their purpose is to lead to the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the implementation of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, which we absolutely cannot allow. All revolutionary people must be highly vigilant. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat through partial improvements. All words and deeds that conform to this purpose, we will firmly support; on the contrary, all words and deeds that attempt to weaken or even abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, we will definitely firmly oppose.

    加强无产阶级专政　防止资本主义复辟
    中共中央党校　红工文
    毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一划时代的光辉著作，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，提出了在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，阶级斗争依然存在，必须继续巩固和加强无产阶级专政，以便粉碎资产阶级的一切复辟阴谋，把社会主义革命进行到底，最后战胜资产阶级。
    无产阶级革命是人类历史上最广泛、最深刻、最彻底的革命。对于无产阶级来说，单有经济战线上的社会主义革命，是不够的，并且是不巩固的，还必须进行政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。不然，社会主义的最后胜利，是不可能的。在这个斗争中，意识形态领域的阶级斗争，极为重要。因为阶级敌人总是利用这个阵地兴风作浪，为颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义作舆论准备。
    意识形态领域的阶级斗争，是无产阶级为巩固自己的政权，资产阶级为推翻无产阶级的政权，进行的生死斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    无产阶级专政，是我们在政治战线、经济战线、思想战线上战胜敌人的根本保证。毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中指出：“现在社会主义在意识形态的斗争中，具有优胜的条件。政权的基本力量是在无产阶级领导下的劳动人民手里。共产党有强大的力量和很高的威信。”无产阶级专政，是我们胜利地进行意识形态领域的阶级斗争的法宝。有了无产阶级专政，就可以镇压国内外阶级敌人的反革命活动，保护人民的利益；有了无产阶级专政，就可以广泛发动群众，大大发展社会主义的新文化，更有力地铲除资本主义和封建主义的旧文化；有了无产阶级专政，就有利于在人民内部用民主的方法，进行自我教育，自觉地改造自己，开展灭资兴无的思想斗争。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的实践教育了我们：无产阶级专政是根本的根本，是我们的命根子。无产阶级有了自己的政权，就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失一切，我们对于政权万万不可掉以轻心。
    一切阶级敌人都疯狂地攻击和反对无产阶级专政。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，恶毒地诬蔑“无产阶级专政也有阴暗的一面，产生官僚主义”。他反对讲无产阶级专政，而要“使人感到是大家专政”。他唱的完全是赫鲁晓夫式的“全民国家”的滥调。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中，根据国际和国内无产阶级专政的历史经验，提出了资本主义复辟的危险主要来自党内的修正主义，向全党发出了批判修正主义的战斗号召。
    毛主席指出：“修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。”“修正主义者抹杀社会主义和资本主义的区别，抹杀无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的区别。他们所主张的，在实际上并不是社会主义路线，而是资本主义路线。在现在的情况下，修正主义是比教条主义更有害的东西。我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”
    无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，必然反映到我们党内来。反革命修正主义分子是资产阶级在党内的代理人。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，放肆地攻击无产阶级专政和共产党的领导，极力鼓吹资本主义，反对社会主义。
    毛主席教导我们，在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，集中地表现为无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，他们同无产阶级的矛盾，是无产阶级专政时期的主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。无产阶级文化大革命主要就是要解决这个矛盾，要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来斗垮、斗倒、斗臭，对他们进行夺权的斗争。
    我们进行无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了巩固无产阶级的政权，加强无产阶级专政。无产阶级要对阶级敌人实行专政，就必须把革命人民坚强地团结起来，而要加强无产阶级的团结，无产阶级的组织性和纪律性是不可缺少的。列宁说过：无产阶级专政的“主要实质就在于劳动者的先进部队，其先锋队，其唯一领导者即无产阶级的组织性和纪律性”。一年来，无产阶级文化大革命的实践经验告诉我们：必须正确地处理无产阶级的民主和集中、自由和纪律的关系。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们享受了最大限度的民主和自由。毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中说：“这个自由是有领导的自由，这个民主是集中指导下的民主，不是无政府状态。”如果搞无政府主义，不要无产阶级的组织和纪律，那就只会削弱我们对阶级敌人的斗争，削弱无产阶级专政。这是和无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的背道而驰的。
    无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动能够这样地迅速开展，能够取得这样辉煌的胜利，就是因为它是在无产阶级专政的条件下进行的，是在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的正确领导下进行的。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，最雄辩地说明：我们国家是伟大的无产阶级专政的国家；我们的党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党；十七年来，在我们党内占统治地位的，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，在我国占统治地位的，是无产阶级专政，不是资产阶级专政。这些都是必须完全肯定的。
    有些人看不清事情的本质，分不清主流和支流，有片面地否定过去的一切的倾向，提出什么“彻底改善无产阶级专政”的口号，这是错误的。因为无产阶级专政在我国是已经占了统治地位的，党内走资本主义道路的当权派只是一小撮人，被他们篡夺了领导权的只是无产阶级政权中的某些部分，决不是全体。有些别有用心的人，歪曲事实，妄图彻底否定过去的一切，他们的目的，就是要由此导致推翻无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政，这是我们绝对不能容许的。一切革命人民必须十分警惕。我国无产阶级文化大革命，就是要通过部分改善无产阶级专政，来加强无产阶级专政。凡是符合于这个目的的言论和行动，我们就要坚决支持；反之，凡是企图削弱甚至取消无产阶级专政的言论和行动，我们就一定要坚决反对。
