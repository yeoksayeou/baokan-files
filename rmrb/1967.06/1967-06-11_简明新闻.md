	South African Colonial Authorities Murder Nine Freedom Fighters

	Faced with the deepening armed struggle of the people in various countries of southern Africa, the South African white colonialist regime is in a state of panic and has recently intensified its repression of the African people.

	On May 30, the South African authorities brazenly murdered nine freedom fighters of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania in Pretoria. These nine revolutionaries were sentenced to death because they participated in the famous 1963 Paarl uprising.

	The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association issued a statement strongly condemning this heinous crime committed by the South African fascist group backed by U.S. and British imperialism.
