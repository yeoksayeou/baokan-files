According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 10th, Arab and other Asian, African, and Latin American students, along with some Yugoslav students, held a protest march on the 5th against the aggression of American and British imperialism and their tool, Israel, against Arab countries. They intended to continue their protest at the American and British embassies on the 6th but were obstructed by a large number of armed military police from the Tito clique.

Enraged, the students decided on the evening of the 6th to protest at the USIS (United States Information Service) reading room. To avoid the armed police, about a thousand students, in small groups, converged from various directions towards the center of Belgrade, holding a massive protest march near the USIS. The students chanted slogans such as "Down with American imperialism," "Down with Johnson," and "Down with Israel," and rushed towards the USIS. Some Arab students, filled with hatred towards American imperialism and anger towards the Yugoslav revisionist clique, stormed the USIS reading room, smashing the windows with stones and burning the American flag. At this point, the armed police, who were stationed and equipped with helmets and batons, were terrified, fearing to provoke their master, American imperialism. They then took brutal measures to suppress the protesting students, beating them with batons. It is reported that five Arab students were seriously injured, many were beaten, some had their eyes beaten out, and others had their legs broken. This exposed the ugly face of the Tito clique, the running dogs of American imperialism, who pretend to support but actually betray the Arab people.

The Tito clique's brutal suppression of the protesting students has aroused great anger among Arab and other Asian, African, and Latin American students.

One Arab student said, "Facts have shown us who our friends are and who our enemies are." He excitedly said, "We heard on the radio about Premier Zhou Enlai's telegram. China is the most reliable and faithful friend of the Arab people. With China's strong support, we can defeat the aggressors." Then, with deep emotion, he said, "Wish Chairman Mao good health." Other Arab students also repeatedly expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people for their genuine support for the Arab people's anti-American struggle.

At this time, an Arab student angrily said, "The Soviet Union is a false friend of the Arab people. We no longer believe it. The Soviet Union pretends to support the Arab people but actually colludes with the Americans. The Soviet Union did not provide any weapons when we needed them the most. Soviet warships sailed to the Mediterranean but dared not confront American warships. Yugoslavia is no exception; it does business with Israel. Yugoslav television news programs broadcast Israeli military situations but do not show the struggles of the Arab people."

    美帝走狗铁托集团凶相毕露
    残暴镇压阿拉伯留学生反美示威
    示威学生怒砸美国新闻窗烧毁星条旗
    据新华社十日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：阿拉伯和其他亚非拉国家的留学生和部分南斯拉夫学生，在五日举行了抗议美英帝国主义及其工具以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的示威游行后，原拟在六日再去美英大使馆示威游行，但遭到铁托叛徒集团的大批武装军警的阻挠。
    被激怒了的留学生，六日晚决定去美国新闻处阅览室示威。为了避免武装警察的阻挠，约一千名学生，化整为零、三三两两从各个方向涌向贝尔格莱德市中心，在美国新闻处附近举行了声势浩大的示威游行。学生们高呼：“打倒美帝国主义”，“打倒约翰逊”，“打倒以色列”等口号，直奔美国新闻处。部分阿拉伯学生带着对美帝国主义的莫大仇恨和对南斯拉夫修正主义集团的极大愤怒，冲到美国新闻处阅览室，用石头砸毁了美国阅览室的玻璃窗，并且焚烧了美国国旗。这时，受命林立在美国新闻处的头戴钢盔、手持警棍的武装警察惊恐万分，生怕惹怒了铁托叛徒集团的主子——美帝国主义，于是采取了残暴的镇压措施，用警棍毒打示威学生。据悉，当场有五名阿拉伯学生受重伤，许多学生遭到毒打，有的眼睛被打出血，有的腿被打坏。这赤裸裸地暴露了美帝走狗铁托叛徒集团对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的丑恶嘴脸。
    铁托集团残暴镇压示威学生的罪行，激起了阿拉伯及其他亚非拉留学生的极大愤怒。
    一位阿拉伯学生说，“事实使我们认清了谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人”。他激动地说：“我们从广播中听到了周恩来总理的电报，中国是阿拉伯人民最可靠、最忠实的朋友。有中国的坚强支持，我们就能打败侵略者”。接着，他无限深情地说：“祝毛主席身体健康”。阿拉伯其他学生也一再向中国朋友表示，感谢中国人民对阿拉伯人民反美斗争的真正支持。
    这时一个阿拉伯学生忿忿地说：“苏联是阿拉伯人民的假朋友，我们再也不相信它了。苏联表面上装出支持阿拉伯人民的姿态，实际上却同美帝勾结。苏联在我们最需要武器的时候，什么也不给。苏联军舰开到地中海，却不敢同美国军舰较量。南斯拉夫也不例外，它同以色列作交易。南斯拉夫的电视新闻节目尽放映以色列军队的情况，却根本不放映阿拉伯人民的斗争情况。”
