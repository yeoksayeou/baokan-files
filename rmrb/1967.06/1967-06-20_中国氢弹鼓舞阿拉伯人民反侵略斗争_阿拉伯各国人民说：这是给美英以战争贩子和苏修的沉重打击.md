According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, Arab friends who are currently resisting the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel are enthusiastically celebrating China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb. They are elated and spreading the news, viewing this as another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a tremendous support for the Arab peoples' anti-aggression struggle, and a heavy blow to U.S. and British war-mongers and Soviet revisionists.

In the United Arab Republic, a driver said, "We warmly congratulate the Chinese people on the successful detonation of their first hydrogen bomb."

He said, "At this critical moment when the U.S., Britain, and Israel are invading us, the Soviet leaders have betrayed us. Although we have suffered some setbacks, we will not be discouraged, because the great People's Republic of China stands with us. We are determined to continue the struggle until we eliminate U.S. imperialism and its bases in the Middle East."

A journalist called the Chinese embassy to express his warm congratulations, saying, "The successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb greatly inspires the Arab peoples' struggle against the aggression of the three countries (U.S., Britain, and Israel)."

A Syrian friend, Adib, said: "I am very happy to hear this good news. This achievement belongs not only to China but to all the peoples of the world. It is a guarantee for world peace and the security of small countries, and it has greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism. Famous writer Rikabi said: I applaud this achievement. All revolutionary peoples will be more determined, and imperialists and Zionists will tremble in the face of this great achievement. With China, this powerful fortress, the day of imperialism's downfall will come sooner."

In the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, wherever Xinhua News Agency reporters go, they receive warm congratulations from Sudanese friends. The secretary-general of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Mirghani Ali Mustafa, said: "China's detonation of a hydrogen bomb is a political bomb that inspires the peoples of the world and deals a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism."

The secretary-general of the Sudanese-African Unity Organization, Rahman Muhammad Bashir, said: "The successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb is a great support for the Vietnamese and Arab peoples in their struggle against imperialism."

A Sudanese journalist, upon hearing the news of China's successful detonation of a hydrogen bomb, excitedly said: "This is truly great."

He pointed out that at a time when imperialists and traitors are gathering in New York, this will truly help the cause of Arab liberation. An editor said: "All oppressed peoples of the world are now more proud and confident, dealing a heavy blow to imperialists and their lackeys. The Chinese people are our true friends, and they support us in our life-and-death struggle against imperialist invaders."

In Yemen, Yemen's Minister of Information, Yahya Bahran, said on the 18th: "China's successful detonation of a hydrogen bomb is a great support for the Arab peoples who are fighting against U.S.-Israeli armed aggression. As long as imperialism exists in the world, China's hydrogen bomb is beneficial to the peoples of the world and beneficial to the defense of world peace."

Deputy Foreign Minister Ahmed Haddad said: "Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, China's successful detonation of a hydrogen bomb greatly strengthens the Vietnamese people and the Arab peoples who are fighting against U.S. imperialism."

The Algerian newspaper *Al-Mujahid* reported on the 19th about China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb, saying, "This is a world-shaking event. All countries fighting against imperialism are jubilant and regard this victory as their own."

The editor-in-chief of Iraq's *Al-Jumhuriya* newspaper, Faisal Hassan, published a commentary on the front page on the 18th, celebrating China's successful detonation of a hydrogen bomb. The commentary said, "This is the achievement of a heroic people, and it deals a heavy blow to the war-mongers in Washington, London, and Tel Aviv."
