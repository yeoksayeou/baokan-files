Syrian military and civilians are united in their resistance against Israeli aggression, displaying high morale and fierce determination in their just war. On June 10, Israeli forces invading Quneitra faced heavy losses from Syrian troops.

According to a broadcast by Damascus Radio on June 11, Syrian forces heroically resisted Israeli attacks on all fronts. The Israeli troops, which had penetrated about 15 kilometers into Syrian territory to Quneitra, suffered significant losses in both manpower and equipment.

Western news agencies reported that Israeli aggressors launched multiple attacks on Quneitra using armored units and even incendiary bombs. However, they were met with fierce counterattacks from Syrian artillery. Throughout June 10, both sides engaged in intense battles. Even Israeli officers had to admit that the Syrian army fought like lions.

On June 11, Damascus Radio announced that UN Secretary-General U Thant declared a ceasefire between Syrian and Israeli forces at 9:30 PM on June 10 (3:30 AM Beijing time on June 11). UN "observers" are now in Quneitra.

However, Syrian military and civilians remain vigilant and unyielding. In the Syrian capital Damascus, the atmosphere is still tense and battle-ready. The streets are filled with regular troops and militiamen, and military vehicles are frequently seen. Soldiers are building fortifications with sandbags at intersections and on balconies, polishing their automatic weapons in the sunlight, and preparing ammunition belts, ready to strike back at any invading forces.

Damascus Radio continues to broadcast patriotic songs and marches to boost morale. The radio also repeatedly condemns the aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel against Arab countries, shouting, "Down with war monger Johnson!" The radio stated, "We will never restore relations with the American and British pirates who aid the Israeli aggressors."

Damascus Radio also calls on Arab peoples to permanently stop exporting oil to imperialist countries, to sabotage their bases, and to cease dealing with the United States.

According to a report from New China News Agency in Baghdad on June 10, the people of Baghdad held a massive demonstration on June 10, chanting slogans such as "We want weapons!" and "We are not afraid of the (U.S.) Sixth Fleet!" to express their determination to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

According to a report from New China News Agency in Algiers on June 10, Algerian Revolutionary Council Chairman and Prime Minister Houari Boumedienne delivered a televised address to the nation, strongly condemning the armed aggression by U.S. and British imperialism and their lackey Israel against Arab countries. He pointed out that the recent events experienced by the Arab nation "have helped it distinguish between its true friends and its enemies."

Boumedienne pointed out that the armed aggression against Arab countries, jointly planned in Washington, London, and other places, has now been exposed to the light of day. He said, "The war imposed on us by imperialism, primarily represented by the United States and Britain, in alliance with world Zionism, is a genuine new crusade."

Boumedienne, in his speech, condemned the disgraceful role played by the U.S. imperialist tool, the UN Security Council, in this war. He said that the actions of the UN "are nothing new to us." He pointed out that as long as imperialism continues to control the UN, the Security Council will not recognize the rights of the Arab people to resist imperialism.

Boumedienne also said, "Between injustice and justice, between aggression and anti-aggression, between slavery and freedom, there can be no neutrality. Taking a neutral stance means avoiding a position, which is to support aggression."

Boumedienne called on the Arab nation to unite as one, to carry on the struggle against imperialism and Zionism to the end. He said that although the Arab people have temporarily suffered setbacks, this situation will not undermine their firm resolve to eliminate imperialism and Zionism.

    伊拉克人民示威要求发给武器同侵略者战斗
    布迈丁说美以的侵略使阿拉伯人民辨明了敌人和朋友
    据新华社十一日讯　叙利亚全国军民同仇敌忾，斗志昂扬，英勇顽强地投入了反抗以色列侵略的正义战争。在十日侵入库奈特腊的以色列军队，受到了叙利亚部队的沉重打击。
    据大马士革电台在十一日宣布，叙利亚部队在所有战线上都英雄般地抵抗了以色列的进攻。侵入位于叙利亚境内约十五公里的库奈特腊的以色列军，在兵力和装备上都遭到巨大损失。
    西方通讯社的报道也说，以色列侵略军用装甲部队向库奈特腊发动了数次进攻，并曾使用了汽油弹。但是遭到了叙利亚军迫击炮的猛烈回击。在十日一整天，双方进行了十分激烈的争夺战。连以色列军官也不得不承认，叙利亚军队打得象狮子般地勇猛。
    十一日，大马士革电台的广播说，联合国秘书长吴丹在联合国宣布，叙利亚和以色列部队在十日晚九时半（北京时间十一日凌晨三点半）已经停火。联合国“观察员”现在在库奈特腊。
    但是，叙利亚军民并未因此放松警惕，松懈斗志。在叙利亚首都大马士革，仍充满紧张战斗的气氛。大街上到处都是正规军和民兵，军用车辆来往频繁。战士们用沙包在十字路口和阳台上堆了工事，在阳光下擦亮自己的自动武器，并整理子弹袋，准备随时回击胆敢继续进犯的侵略军。
    大马士革电台仍在不断播送爱国歌曲和进行曲，鼓舞士气。电台还不断谴责美英以三国侵略阿拉伯国家，并高呼：“打倒战争贩子约翰逊！”电台说：“我们将决不同帮助以色列侵略者的英美海盗们恢复关系。”
    大马士革电台还号召阿拉伯人民永远停止向帝国主义国家输送石油，破坏它们的基地，并不再同美国打交道。
    据新华社巴格达十日电　伊拉克首都巴格达人民十日举行盛大示威游行，激昂地高呼“我们要武器！”“我们不怕（美国）第六舰队！”等口号，表示要同美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列斗争到底。
    据新华社阿尔及尔十日电　阿尔及利亚革命委员会主席、政府总理胡阿里·布迈丁十日向全国发表电视讲话，强烈谴责美、英帝国主义以及它们的走狗以色列武装侵略阿拉伯国家，并且指出：阿拉伯民族刚刚经历的事件，“使它辨明了谁是它真正的朋友和谁是它的敌人。”
    布迈丁指出，在华盛顿、伦敦和其它地方共同策划的武装侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋，现在已经暴露在光天化日之下。他说：“同世界犹太复国主义结成联盟的、主要以美国和英国为代表的帝国主义所强加在我们头上的战争，是一场地地道道的新的十字军战争。”
    布迈丁在讲话中谴责美帝国主义的工具联合国安理会在这次战争中所扮演的不光彩角色。他说，联合国的行径“对我们并不是什么新鲜的东西”。他指出，在帝国主义继续控制联合国的情况下，安理会不可能承认阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义的权利。
    布迈丁还说：“在非正义和正义之间、在侵略和反对侵略之间、在奴役和自由之间不能有中立。采取中立就是避免表态，也就是支持侵略。”
    布迈丁号召阿拉伯民族团结得象一个人一样，把反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争进行到底。他说，虽然阿拉伯人民暂时受到了挫折，但是这种情况决不能损害阿拉伯人民消灭帝国主义和犹太复国主义的坚定决心。
