On the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's epoch-making and brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the officers and soldiers of the military stationed in Qinghai Province, as well as representatives of the "August 18" revolutionary organization, discussed their experiences and insights from applying this work during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The following is a summary of their speeches.

Liu Xianquan, Commander of the Qinghai Military Region, said:

Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People to Organize a Mighty Revolutionary Army

The contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is an antagonistic contradiction. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death class struggle. Overthrowing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the main contradiction that our cultural revolution must resolve. The method to resolve this main contradiction is to use great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, through mass movements of exposure, accusation, criticism, and struggle, to thoroughly expose their counter-revolutionary revisionist faces, and to fight them down, smash them, and overthrow them. To do this, we must organize a mighty revolutionary army.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To organize tens of thousands and millions of people, to mobilize a mighty revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." How can we organize such a mighty revolutionary army? We must thoroughly study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and use this work to correctly handle the various contradictions among the people that we encounter in the current struggle.

Based on the experience of the Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province over the past year, to correctly handle contradictions among the people, we should pay attention to correctly handling the following four relationships:

First, correctly handle the relationship between revolutionary mass organizations and the masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations. The contradiction between the masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations and us revolutionaries is a contradiction among the people. Although they have joined the wrong side and said and done some wrong things, they are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line and are innocent. Revolutionary mass organizations should help them with all their hearts and do thorough and detailed ideological work. To make them aware, we must grasp the main contradiction, hold the correct direction, and fiercely fight the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, mobilizing the masses in conservative organizations who have been deceived to expose their behind-the-scenes manipulators, so that they can draw a clear line with the capitalist-roaders within the Party. The more thoroughly we expose and criticize the capitalist-roaders within the Party, the more we can help the deceived masses quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Second, correctly handle the relationship within revolutionary mass organizations. Within revolutionary mass organizations, due to various reasons, some contradictions and differences arise. This is a normal phenomenon and is a contradiction among the people that arises under the premise of a unified direction. We should solve this contradiction according to Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, using the method of "unity-criticism-unity." The main issues within revolutionary organizations are individualism, factionalism, cliquism, and anarchism. When we discover these tendencies, we must use the "Three Articles" as weapons, fiercely fight against selfishness, and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must bravely engage in self-criticism, seek common ground while reserving differences, unite, and fight together against the enemy, promoting the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and achieving a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Third, correctly handle the relationship between revolutionary masses and erring cadres. Regarding erring cadres, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and look at their entire history and work. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who persist in their errors and are incorrigible, we should allow them to make a revolution and redeem their mistakes. We not only dare to strike down a handful but also dare to liberate a large number. Only in this way can we carry out the Cultural Revolution well and unite the majority of cadres.

Fourth, strengthen the relationship between the military and revolutionary mass organizations. The military, following Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly supports the revolutionary leftists. However, in the course of supporting the left, there may be some shortcomings and errors. We must wholeheartedly respond to Chairman Mao's call to support the army and love the people. The military should actively seek the opinions and criticisms of the revolutionary masses on their support work. If the military makes mistakes in their support work, the revolutionary masses should use the method of handling contradictions among the people to kindly offer criticism and suggestions. Our military is created by Chairman Mao and will forever be heart-to-heart with the revolutionaries. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight together, unite together, and win together, and we will be invincible.

Zhang Jianglin, Deputy Commander of the Qinghai Military Region, said:

The Invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a Powerful Ideological Weapon for Supporting the Left

Chairman Mao's great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a powerful ideological weapon for our military's support of the left, a telescope and microscope for us to distinguish who are the revolutionaries and who are the conservatives, who are revolutionary cadres and who are capitalist-roaders.

Supporting the left first requires distinguishing between enemies and friends. In a situation where organizations are numerous, the situation is complex, and the struggle is fierce, how do we distinguish between enemies and friends? Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the period of building socialism, all classes, strata, and social groups that support, approve of, and participate in the cause of socialist construction are within the scope of the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are the enemies of the people." This is the dividing line for us to judge whether all mass organizations stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, whether they are truly revolutionary or pseudo-revolutionary. In our support work, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the method of class analysis, so we can clearly distinguish between enemies and friends, and our support for the revolutionary leftists is accurate and powerful. The revolutionary mass organizations in Qinghai Province, such as "August 18," despite having various shortcomings in the cultural revolution, have always directed their struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, firmly defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, repeatedly repelling the counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and always holding the correct direction of the struggle. Therefore, we firmly support the "August 18" revolutionaries. In the February counter-revolutionary restoration tide, the class enemies incited uninformed masses to attack and beat us, why was our belief in supporting the "August 18" revolutionaries unshakable? It is because we firmly believe in Chairman Mao's great teachings.

Experience in struggle tells us that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our support work, and we cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment in our support work.

Yin Huashan, from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai Province, said:

Whether or not we can correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions ultimately depends on a worldview issue.

In the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, how to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use the viewpoint of class struggle, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, distinguish between enemies and friends, clarify right and wrong, grasp the main contradiction, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, "unite our true friends to attack our true enemies," is a very important issue. However, whether we can correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, whether we can stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, ultimately depends on a worldview issue. If our standpoint and viewpoint are wrong, we will consciously or unconsciously confuse the two types of contradictions of different natures, invert right and wrong, and fail to distinguish between enemies and friends.

Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people have made our class standpoint clearer and our class position firmer, enabling us to correctly identify the leftists in our support work and recognize that the direction of struggle of the "August 18" revolutionary organization is completely correct. Therefore, we are not afraid of taking risks, not afraid of being attacked, not afraid of being labeled with this or that "hat," and we can love what the leftists love and be concerned about what the leftists are concerned about.

We deeply feel that in the process of applying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in our support work, it is a process of transforming both the subjective and objective worlds, making a revolution in the depths of the soul, and conducting a struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. If selfishness is in command, you will not understand the great proletarian cultural revolution, you will not be able to distinguish between the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction, between antagonistic contradictions and contradictions among the people. If selfishness is in command, you will not be able to recognize the direction of the struggle, and you will not have the daring to think, speak, act, and rebel against the capitalist-roaders within the Party. If selfishness is in command, you will inevitably be afraid, unable to boldly identify the leftists, rely on the leftists, and firmly support the leftists. If you have a proletarian worldview and public-mindedness is in command, you will be more conscious of approaching the leftists, supporting the leftists, breathing with the leftists, sharing destiny with the leftists, uniting with the leftists, fighting with the leftists, and winning with the leftists.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." To correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions of different natures, firmly grasp the main contradiction, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we must grasp the contradiction between the two worldviews of "public" and "private" in our minds, constantly learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, transform our thoughts, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever be heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses.

Ma Jiuwen, a standing committee member of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebellion Committee of Qinghai Province, said:

Insist on verbal struggle, not physical struggle, as a powerful weapon for handling contradictions among the people.

Currently, Qinghai Province is in a great situation, and we revolutionaries are proud and confident. This is the result of our distinguishing between the two types of contradictions of different natures and correctly handling contradictions among the people according to Chairman Mao's teachings; it is the result of the revolutionary organizations insisting on unity and implementing revolutionary great unity, instead of splitting and "fighting internal wars." All this is thanks to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Chairman Mao's policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people has played a tremendous role in the Qinghai region.

When we first stood up, we generally had a psychological tendency to give the conservative organization's masses a heavy blow, otherwise, we could not vent our anger. However, after studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the fists we extended slowly retracted. Because the deceived masses are not our enemies, doing so would be treating them as enemies. Moreover, doing so would not truly solve the problem but would deepen the contradiction between them and the revolutionaries. Doing so would not cleanse the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line but would push the deceived masses to the enemy's side. We feel that the policy of "using verbal struggle, not physical struggle" is precisely the powerful weapon guiding us to handle contradictions among the people. Engaging in physical struggle hits not just one person but class brothers.

Therefore, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, we revolutionaries must be both daring fighters and models of policy implementation; we must dare to make a revolution and be good at making a revolution; we must dare to strike down a handful and dare to liberate a large number. This is our current most urgent task.

Liu Minggan, a standing committee member of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebellion Committee of Qinghai Province, said:

The proletarian revolutionaries cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment.

The class struggle practice over the past year has taught us: the proletarian revolutionaries cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. Acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will be victorious, and the cause will develop; if we deviate slightly from Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will suffer setbacks, and the work will fail. In January, we proletarian revolutionaries seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee. However, since they were still deceiving many masses, in February, a counter-revolutionary tide rose from the bottom up, brutally suppressing the "August 18" revolutionary rebels, and snatched back the power we had seized. In those days of arduous struggle, we studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with questions in mind. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts illuminated our hearts. According to Chairman Mao's class standpoint and class analysis method, we strictly distinguished between enemies and friends. In the struggle, we focused on two aspects: one is to concentrate our efforts to fiercely strike down the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party, showing no mercy and no leniency, fighting resolutely, and overthrowing them. The other is to actively educate the deceived masses, win over the middle forces, and unite the majority. In this way, many deceived masses returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses were more united than ever, and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were completely isolated. The entire province entered a new stage of great criticism, great unity, and great seizure of power. We deeply feel that seizing power, in a certain sense, is also to seize the deceived masses from the capitalist-roaders. The more deceived masses stand on the revolutionary line, the more strength the revolution gains.

In summary, all the victories of our revolutionaries are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought in Qinghai, and they are also the great victories of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on correctly handling contradictions among the people.

Wang Zhongshan, a standing committee member of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebellion Committee of Qinghai Province, said:

When winning over the deceived masses, we must first have the desire for unity.

We revolutionaries must win over, educate, and unite the masses who have participated in conservative organizations, and we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, clarify right and wrong, and achieve new unity on a new basis."

From our struggle practice, whenever we truly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, the masses were fully mobilized, the work of winning over the deceived masses was smooth, and the revolutionary forces rapidly developed and grew stronger, occupying an absolute advantage in both politics and organization. Whenever we deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings and acted on our own, the work of winning over the deceived masses encountered difficulties, and sometimes we were even put in a passive position in the struggle.

When implementing the instructions of "unity-criticism-unity," we must first have the desire to unite the deceived masses. As Chairman Mao teaches: "Because if there is no desire for unity in one's mind, a struggle will inevitably make things chaotic and unmanageable." This desire for unity should not be forced but should be sincere. Chairman Mao's instructions of "three trusts and three relies" include trusting and relying on the masses. We must believe that except for a few bad leaders in the conservative organizations, the majority of the deceived masses want revolution, and through education, they can return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Wang Qili, a standing committee member of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebellion Committee of Qinghai Province, said:

Chairman Mao's great works have educated the deceived masses to recognize the direction of the struggle.

We proletarian revolutionaries, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, and have smashed the counter-revolutionary restoration plots of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their lackeys in Qinghai, achieving one glorious victory after another in the Cultural Revolution.

Our Qinghai Nationalities Institute has seven ethnic groups: Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Han, and others. Some students, due to being deceived, temporarily lost their direction. Most of them are from poor herdsmen and poor peasants, having deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. To make the deceived masses quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we first helped them study Chairman Mao's works, study "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and helped the deceived masses distinguish between our enemies and our friends. In this way, they recognized that our common enemy is the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, while "August 18" defends Mao Zedong Thought with blood and life, is the true revolutionary, and is their class brother. Later, through reminiscing about bitterness and sweetness, comparing the old and new societies, carrying out great criticism, great exposure, and great accusation against the capitalist-roaders within the Party, their class consciousness was raised. Thus, they stood up and launched a "counterattack," standing on the revolutionary line. Our "August 18" Red Guards "Eleventh" National Unity Combat Team grew stronger and stronger.

Practice has proven: we use Chairman Mao's great thoughts on correctly handling contradictions among the people to unite, win over, and educate the deceived masses, and we can make them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Cai Mingde, a committee member of the "August 18" Revolutionary Rebellion United Committee of Qinghai Automobile Factory No. 3, said:

Thousands of accounts, tens of thousands of accounts, all should be charged to the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

We "August 18" revolutionary fighters all suffered to varying degrees from the persecution of class enemies using the deceived masses in the February counter-revolutionary restoration tide. Therefore, whenever we see the conservative organization's masses who once beat us, we truly want to beat them up. However, every time we clench our fists, Chairman Mao's teachings appear before our eyes: "Policy and strategy are the life of the Party; all levels of leaders must pay full attention, and never be careless." We revolutionary rebels love Chairman Mao infinitely and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, so the clenched fists are loosened again.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our contradiction with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is an antagonistic contradiction; our contradiction with the broad masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations is a contradiction among the people. In our factory, more than 300 people who participated in the conservative organization come from the families of poor and lower-middle peasants and other laboring people. Their subjective desire is to make a revolution. However, due to long-term poisoning by the bourgeois reactionary line, in the sharp and complex class struggle, they have a poor understanding of Chairman Mao's thoughts, unconsciously falling for the class enemies' tricks and helping the enemy. Although they have done some bad things, they are fundamentally different from the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and conspirators. If we direct our attacks at them, we will fall for the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Therefore, we proletarian revolutionaries must charge all the accounts, all the sins, to the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. For the deceived masses, we must use great class sympathy to help them break away from the conservative organizations and liberate themselves from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Chen Faxiang, from the "August 18" Red Guards Combat Team of Xiaogao Village Production Brigade in Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, said:

The most fundamental thing to do the work of the deceived masses is to arm the mind with Mao Zedong Thought.

With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of our unit, we seriously organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," armed our minds with this brilliant work, unified our understanding, and then won over all the deceived masses in the brigade to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We deeply feel that to do the work of the deceived masses, the most fundamental thing is to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. For the deceived masses, it is the same. As long as they have revolutionary thoughts in their minds and distinguish between enemies and friends, they can liberate themselves and educate themselves. Based on this understanding, we held a full brigade meeting of community members, accused the crimes of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, and conducted reminiscing about bitterness and sweetness education in the teams, letting the old poor peasants in the brigade tell their family histories and village histories, and speak of the bitterness of the poor and lower-middle peasants being exploited and oppressed by the Kuomintang bandits in the old society, and the sweetness of Chairman Mao leading the poor and lower-middle peasants to build socialism. Through this series of work, the revolutionary forces grew stronger and stronger, the enthusiasm of the community members for revolution and production reached an unprecedented height, and good people and good deeds that love the collective and forget self-interest kept emerging. Now, we are launching a great criticism movement against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain unit in Qinghai Province, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," rehearsed many short performances to go to the streets and factories to perform, propagating the great significance of this brilliant document.

    正确区分两类矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    青海省驻军和“八·一八”革命组织代表座谈《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部划时代的光辉文献发表十周年的时候，青海省驻军指战员以及“八·一八”革命组织的代表，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限崇敬和热爱，畅谈了在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中活学活用这篇著作的体会和经验。下面是这些同志的谈话摘要。
    青海省军区司令员　刘贤权说：
    正确处理人民内部矛盾组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军
    无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。我们同他们的斗争，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是我们文化革命要解决的主要矛盾。解决这个主要矛盾的方法，就是要运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，通过群众性的大揭发、大控诉、大批判、大斗争，彻底暴露他们的反革命修正主义面目，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒。要这样，就必须组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”怎样才能组织起这样一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军？我们必须很好地学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部光辉著作，运用这篇光辉著作，正确处理当前现实斗争中所遇到的人民内部的各种矛盾。
    根据青海省一年来文化大革命的实践经验，要正确处理人民内部矛盾，应当注意正确处理好四个关系：
    第一、正确处理革命群众组织同受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众之间的关系。受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众与我们革命派的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾。他们虽然站错了队，说了一些错话，做了一些错事，但是，他们同样是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，是无罪的。革命群众组织应当以满腔的热情来帮助他们，进行深入细致的思想工作。要促使他们觉悟，就要抓住主要矛盾，掌握大方向，狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，发动保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众揭发他们的幕后操纵者，使他们同党内走资本主义道路当权派划清界限。对党内走资本主义道路当权派揭露、批判得越彻底，也就越能促使受蒙蔽的群众迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    第二、正确处理革命群众组织之间的关系。在革命群众组织内部，由于种种原因，发生一些矛盾和分歧，这是正常现象，这是在大方向一致的前提下产生的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾。对这种矛盾，我们应当按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，运用“团结——批评——团结”的方法来解决。革命组织内部“打内战”，主要是个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义、无政府主义作怪。当我们发现这种苗头后，就要以“老三篇”为武器，狠斗“私”字，大立毛泽东思想，勇敢地进行自我批评，求大同，存小异，团结起来，共同对敌，促进革命的大联合和革命的三结合，取得文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    第三、正确处理革命群众和犯错误干部的关系。对待犯错误的干部，要根据毛主席的教导，看他们的全部历史和全部工作。只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们革命，立功赎罪。我们不但要敢于打击一小撮，而且要勇于解放一大片，只有这样，才能搞好文化大革命，团结干部的大多数。
    第四、搞好解放军和革命群众组织的关系。解放军根据毛主席的指示，是坚定不移地支持革命左派的；但是在支左工作中，也可能会出现这样或那样的缺点和错误。我们要坚决响应毛主席拥军爱民的号召。解放军应当经常主动地征求革命群众对支左工作的意见和批评；解放军如果在支左工作中出现了缺点和错误，革命群众就要用处理人民内部矛盾的方法，善意地提出批评和建议。我们解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的，永远与革命派心连心的。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远战斗在一起，团结在一起，胜利在一起，就无往而不胜。
    青海省军区副司令员　张江霖说：
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是支左工作的强大思想武器
    毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部伟大著作，是我军支左工作的强大思想武器，是使我们识别谁是革命派，谁是保守派，谁是革命干部，谁是走资本主义道路当权派的望远镜和显微镜。
    支左工作首先要分清敌我。在组织繁多、情况复杂、斗争激烈的情况下，怎样区分敌我友呢？毛主席教导我们说：“在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”这就是我们判断所有群众组织是站在毛主席的革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的分水岭，是真革命，还是假革命的分界线。我们在支左工作中，按照毛主席的教导，运用阶级分析的方法，就分得清敌我，对革命左派的支持就准确有力。青海省“八·一八”等革命群众组织，在文化革命运动中尽管有这样那样的缺点，但是他们的斗争矛头一直指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，一次又一次打退了资产阶级反动路线的反扑，始终坚持了斗争的大方向。因此，我们就坚决支持了“八·一八”革命派。在今年二月反革命复辟逆流中，阶级敌人挑动不明真相的群众对我们进行围攻和殴打，我们支持“八·一八”革命派的信念为什么坚定不移？就是因为我们坚信毛主席的伟大教导。
    斗争经验告诉我们，毛泽东思想是我们支左工作的灵魂，在支左工作中一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。
    解放军驻青海省某部　殷华山说：
    能否正确区分和处理两类矛盾归根结底是一个世界观的问题
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，如何按照毛主席的教导，运用阶级斗争的观点，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，分清敌我，明辨是非，抓住主要矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，“团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人”，这是一个极为重要的问题。但是，能不能正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，能不能站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，归根结底是个世界观的问题。如果立场观点错了，就会自觉或者不自觉地混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，是非颠倒，敌我不分。
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，使我们阶级观点更明确、阶级立场更坚定，使我们在支左工作中，能正确识别左派，认清“八·一八”革命派的斗争大方向是完全正确的。所以我们不怕担风险，不怕受围攻，不怕戴上这样或那样的“帽子”，能爱左派所爱，急左派所急。
    我们深深体会到，在支左工作中，活学活用毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作的过程，就是改造主观世界和客观世界，在灵魂深处闹革命，进行破私立公的过程。如果“私”字当头，你就理解不了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，就分辨不清哪是主要矛盾，哪是次要矛盾，哪是敌我矛盾，哪是人民内部矛盾。如果“私”字当头，你也就认不清斗争的大方向，就不可能有敢想、敢说、敢干、敢造党内走资本主义道路当权派反的大无畏的英雄气概。如果“私”字当头，你必然是怕字当头，不能大胆地识别左派，依靠左派，坚定不移地支持左派。如果，你具有无产阶级的世界观，“公”字当头，就更加自觉地靠近左派，就能够支持左派，同左派同呼吸，共命运，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    毛主席教导我们，“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。为了正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，紧紧抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须抓住头脑中“公”与“私”两种世界观的矛盾，不断地在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，破“私”立“公”，牢固树立无产阶级世界观，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远和革命群众心连心。
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会常委马集文说：
    坚持文斗，不用武斗，是处理人民内部矛盾的有力武器
    目前青海省一片大好形势，我们革命造反派扬眉吐气。这是我们按照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确处理人民内部矛盾的结果；是革命派组织内部坚持团结，实行革命大联合，而不是搞分裂，“打内战”的结果。这一切要感谢毛主席，感谢党中央。毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的政策，在青海地区发挥了巨大威力。
    我们刚刚翻过身的时候，普遍有一种心理，就是要给保守组织的群众以狠狠的打击，否则，不能出气。但是，一经学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》以后，我们伸出去的拳头，又慢慢地缩回来了。因为受蒙蔽的群众不是我们的敌人，那样做就是按敌我矛盾处理了。何况那样做，也不能真正解决问题，只能加深他们和革命派之间的矛盾。那样做，资产阶级反动路线的流毒也不能肃清，反而会把受蒙蔽的群众推向敌人一边。我们体会到，“要用文斗，不用武斗”的政策，正是指导我们处理人民内部矛盾的有力武器。搞武斗，打的不是一个人的问题，而是打的阶级兄弟。
    所以，根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的教导，我们革命派既要做猛打猛冲的闯将，又要做执行政策的模范；既要敢于革命，又要善于革命；既要敢于打击一小撮，又要敢于解放一大片。这是我们革命派当前最迫切的任务。
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会常委刘明乾说：
    无产阶级革命派一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想
    一年来的阶级斗争实践教育了我们：无产阶级革命派一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。按照毛泽东思想办事，革命就胜利，事业就发展；稍一离开毛泽东思想，革命就受挫折，工作就失败。今年一月份，我们无产阶级革命派夺了青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权。可是由于他们仍然欺骗着不少群众，二月份就自下而上掀起了一股反革命逆流，残酷地镇压“八·一八”革命造反派，把我们革命派已夺过来的大权重新抢了回去。在那艰苦斗争的日子里，我们带着问题重新学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。毛主席的光辉思想照亮了我们造反派的心。按照毛主席的阶级观点和阶级分析的方法，我们严格地区分了敌我，在斗争中狠抓了两个方面：一是集中力量狠狠打击青海省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，毫不留情，毫不手软，坚决斗争，坚决打倒。一是积极地教育受蒙蔽的群众，争取中间派，团结大多数。这样就使很多受蒙蔽的群众，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了。革命的群众空前团结了，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底孤立了。全省进入了一个革命的大批判、大联合、大夺权的新阶段。我们深深体会到，夺权就某种意义上说，也就是要从走资本主义道路当权派那里夺取受蒙蔽的群众。多一个受蒙蔽的群众站到革命路线上来，革命就增加了一分力量。
    总之，我们革命派的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想在青海的伟大胜利，也是毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的光辉思想的伟大胜利。
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会常委王中山说：
    在争取受蒙蔽的群众时首先要有团结的愿望
    我们革命派要争取、教育和团结参加过保守组织的群众，就必须按照毛主席的教导，“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，分清是非，在新的基础上达到新的团结。”
    从我们的斗争实践来看，凡是真正按照毛主席这一教导做的，发动群众就充分，做争取受蒙蔽群众的工作就顺利，革命派队伍就迅速发展壮大，在政治上和组织上都占了绝对优势；凡是违背了毛主席这一教导而自行其是的，争取受蒙蔽群众的工作就遇到了困难，甚至有时会使自己在斗争中处于被动的地位。
    在执行“团结——批评——团结”的指示时，首先对受蒙蔽的群众要有团结的愿望。正如毛主席教导的：“因为如果在主观上没有团结的愿望，一斗势必把事情斗乱，不可收拾”。这种团结的愿望不是勉强的，应该是有诚意的。毛主席的三相信三依靠的指示，其中就有一条要相信和依靠群众。我们要相信除保守组织中极个别坏头头之外，大多数受蒙蔽的群众是要革命的，经过教育，是可以回到毛主席的革命路线上来的。
    青海省“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会常委王起力说：
    毛主席伟大著作，教育了受蒙蔽群众认清斗争大方向
    我们无产阶级革命派，是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，才粉碎了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青海的爪牙的复辟阴谋，取得了文化大革命的一个又一个辉煌胜利。
    我们青海民族学院有藏、蒙古、回、汉等七个民族。有部分同学由于受了蒙蔽，一度迷失了方向。他们中间绝大多数是贫苦牧民和贫下中农出身，对党对毛主席有着深厚的阶级感情。我们为了使受蒙蔽的群众迅速地回到毛主席的革命路线一边，首先帮助他们学习毛主席著作，学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，帮助受蒙蔽的群众分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。这样，他们认清了我们的共同敌人，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而“八·一八”用鲜血和生命保卫毛泽东思想，是真正的革命派，是他们的阶级兄弟。以后又通过忆苦思甜，新旧社会对比的教育，开展对党内走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大揭发、大控诉，提高了他们的阶级觉悟。于是，他们纷纷起来大杀“回马枪”，站到革命路线上来，我们“八·一八”红卫兵“十一”民族团结战斗团的队伍就越来越壮大了。
    实践证明：我们用毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的伟大思想，去团结争取教育受蒙蔽的群众，就能使他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    青海汽车三场“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会委员蔡明德说：
    千笔账，万笔账，要记在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派头上
    我们“八·一八”革命派战士在二月反革命复辟逆流中，都不同程度地遭受过阶级敌人假手于受蒙蔽群众的迫害。因此，我们每当看到曾经打过我们的保守组织的群众时，真恨不得打他们一顿。然而每当握紧拳头的时候，毛主席的教导就出现在眼前：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”我们革命造反派无限热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，于是握紧了的拳头就又松开了。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的矛盾，是敌我矛盾；同广大受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众的矛盾是人民内部矛盾。我场参加保守组织的三百多人中，绝大多数出身于贫下中农的家庭和其他劳动人民的家庭，他们的主观愿望是要革命的。但是由于他们长期受到资产阶级反动路线的毒害，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，对毛主席的思想领会较差，不自觉地上了阶级敌人的当，帮了敌人的忙。他们虽然做了些坏事，但是他们和那一小撮反革命修正主义分子和野心家是有根本区别的。如果我们把矛头指向他们，就会上党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的大当。因此，我们无产阶级革命派必须把千笔账，万笔账，千条罪，万条罪，统统记在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的头上。对于受蒙蔽的群众，我们必须用极大的阶级同情，帮助他们从保守组织中杀出来，从资产阶级反动路线的束缚下解放出来。
    青海湟源县小高陵生产大队“八·一八”红卫战斗队陈发祥说：
    要做好受蒙蔽群众的工作最根本的是用毛泽东思想武装头脑
    我们在部队毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真地组织群众学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，用这部光辉著作武装了头脑，统一了认识，然后把队上受蒙蔽的群众都争取到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们深刻地体会到，要做好受蒙蔽群众的工作，最根本的就是用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。对于受蒙蔽的群众也是一样，他们只要头脑中有革命思想，分清了敌我，就能够自己解放自己，自己教育自己。本着这种认识，我们召开了全大队社员大会，控诉了党内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，在小队搞了忆苦思甜教育，让队里苦大仇深的老贫农讲家史、村史，诉贫下中农在旧社会受蒋马匪帮剥削压迫的苦，讲毛主席领导贫下中农建设社会主义的甜。通过这一系列工作，革命派的队伍日益壮大，社员的革命和生产积极性空前高涨，热爱集体，公而忘私的好人好事不断涌现。现在，我们正在掀起对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动。（附图片）
