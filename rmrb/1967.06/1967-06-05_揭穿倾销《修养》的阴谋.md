The top capitalist-roaders in the Party and their clique, in order to restore capitalism in China, desperately opposed the propagation, study, and publication of Chairman Mao's works. They desperately hyped up and peddled the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation." They attempted to replace Chairman Mao's works with "Self-Cultivation." This heinous crime must be exposed and settled.

Before the reprint of "Self-Cultivation" in 1962, the top capitalist-roader in the Party had already, through the old Propaganda Department, spread the word that it was an "authoritative work," "urgently needed by the whole Party," and "beneficial to the international communist movement." After the reprint of "Self-Cultivation," he immediately instructed his counterrevolutionary lackeys to hype up this poisonous weed.

The counterrevolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee specially issued a "notice," fawningly praising "Self-Cultivation" for its "extremely important significance" in "strengthening Party spirit," "enhancing organizational discipline," and "further raising the Marxist-Leninist level of the whole Party." This "notice" was quickly forwarded by the old Propaganda Department to the entire Party.

The old Propaganda Department also mobilized newspapers, periodicals, radio, and other propaganda machines to launch a chorus of praise for "Self-Cultivation." They hailed "Self-Cultivation" as the "combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific experiences of Chinese Communists in self-education and self-transformation," the "great document of our Party's ideological and organizational construction," a work that has made "outstanding contributions to the Marxist-Leninist theory of party building," has had a "tremendous effect," and has "great practical significance," and so on. It is truly shameful!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party and his clique viciously slandered and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. They repeatedly slandered Mao Zedong Thought as so-called "dogmatism," shouting that "there are many in the Party who treat Mao Zedong Thought as dogma." They openly opposed the inclusion of Chairman Mao's statements in Party member textbooks and issued a notice from the old Propaganda Department, banning the mention of "Mao Zedong Thought" in media propaganda. The devils in the old Propaganda Department's hell would go berserk and immediately cut out any mention of "Mao Zedong Thought" when they saw it in manuscripts.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party used various despicable means to force the entire Party and the people of the whole country to study his "Self-Cultivation."

As soon as "Self-Cultivation" was reprinted, he colluded with another top capitalist-roader in the Party to designate "Self-Cultivation" as a "must-read book" for cadres. The old Propaganda Department successively forwarded many "notices" from various regions and departments organizing the study of "Self-Cultivation," vigorously promoting how necessary it is to study "Self-Cultivation"; stipulating that "Self-Cultivation" be used as a "regularly studied must-read document" and "Party and Youth League course material"; ordering "all levels of Party committees to temporarily stop the various study tasks that have been arranged in the past" and "immediately organize all Party members and non-Party cadres to seriously study, discuss, and have symposiums"; and stipulating that "thought styles should be linked," and "self-examinations should be conducted." They also ordered newspapers to open special columns and radio stations to hold special lectures on "Self-Cultivation," vigorously promoting the "benefits" of studying "Self-Cultivation," and so on.

On the other hand, the top capitalist-roader in the Party hated and feared the masses studying Chairman Mao's works to death. He used every means to suppress the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. He viciously attacked workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works as "studying theory with two sticks," shouting that "now studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has led to formalism, and if this continues, it will lead to hypocrisy." He did not allow the publication of notes on studying Chairman Mao's works in newspapers, saying that "writing millions of words of notes, do not propagate them." He instructed the old Propaganda Department to produce a series of documents from 1961 to the spring of 1966, suppressing the study of Chairman Mao's works, which were approved by him and sent to the entire Party. In these documents, they threw out a bunch of sticks against so-called "simplification," "vulgarization," "formalism," "pragmatism," "social coercion," and so on, and viciously suppressed them.

As the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works developed, the masses increasingly eagerly demanded the most beloved book. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party obstructed the publication of Chairman Mao's works in every possible way. At the end of 1961, someone proposed to print more of Chairman Mao's works, but he firmly opposed it, saying, "paper is tight." The counterrevolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi also shouted, "The 10 million-plus sets of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong are not enough, how strange," "publication policies must be regulated, this will not do," "prices must be raised."

From 1961 to 1964, the old Propaganda Department drafted three documents, such as the so-called "Notice on the Approval Procedures for Compiling and Printing Chairman Mao's Works," arbitrarily stipulating that various departments and regions were not allowed to compile and publish Chairman Mao's works. Under such circumstances, it was as difficult as climbing to heaven for the masses to get a copy of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. The masses wrote letters in large numbers, strongly demanding an increase in the printing of Chairman Mao's works. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party and his clique completely ignored them. In early 1965, the old Propaganda Department discovered that the workers of the national metallurgical system had reprinted 30,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and even ordered the forcible collection and destruction of all the quotations from the workers' hands.

In contrast, the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture issued notices to arrange the printing and distribution of various formats, fonts, and languages of "Self-Cultivation," announcing that local areas could print and determine the number of prints and distribution methods on their own. Since the reprint of "Self-Cultivation" in 1962, the number of prints has increased every year, and it has been sold at a reduced price. The result was:

In 1962, not a single copy of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong was distributed domestically, while the reprint of "Self-Cultivation" printed 4,733,300 copies from September to December alone.

From September 1962 to July 1966, "Self-Cultivation" printed 18,400,000 copies, while the Selected Works of Mao Zedong only printed 441,900 sets.

From the national liberation to the first half of 1966, the total number of prints of "Self-Cultivation" reached 20,541,000 copies, while the Selected Works of Mao Zedong only printed 1,142,500 sets.

The old Propaganda Department also vigorously peddled "Self-Cultivation" to more than 80 countries and regions. Since 1962, they have published 190,000 copies in seven foreign languages and plan to add five more foreign language editions. However, in more than six years, the fourth volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong was only published in four foreign languages, totaling 168,000 copies.

The above facts show that the top capitalist-roader in the Party and his clique, using the power they had usurped, practiced bourgeois dictatorship in the field of propaganda and publication.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and Chairman Mao's works have been published and distributed in large quantities. The top capitalist-roader in the Party, along with his "Self-Cultivation," has been swept into the dustbin of history by the broad revolutionary masses. This is the historical verdict!

    揭穿倾销《修养》的阴谋
    党勇　周正举　彭慧兰
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙，为了在中国复辟资本主义，拚死命地反对宣传、学习、出版毛主席著作，拚死命地吹捧和推销大毒草《修养》。他们妄图以《修养》取代毛主席著作。这一滔天大罪，必须揭发清算。
    一九六二年，《修养》再版出笼以前，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就通过旧中宣部放出空气，吹嘘这是一本“权威著作”，“为全党所急需”，“对国际共产主义运动有好处”。《修养》再版出笼后，他立即指使他的反革命党羽，对这株大毒草大吹大捧。
    旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团，特地发出“通知”，肉麻地吹捧《修养》对“增强党性”、“加强组织性纪律性”、“进一步提高全党的马克思列宁主义水平”，“有着极重要的意义”。这个“通知”很快就由旧中宣部转发到全党。
    旧中宣部还开动报纸、刊物、广播等各种宣传机器，搞起了吹捧《修养》的大合唱。他们把《修养》吹捧为“马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国共产党人进行自我教育、自我改造的具体经验的结合”，“我党思想建设和组织建设的伟大文献”，“对马克思列宁主义的建党学说，作出了杰出的贡献”，“起了巨大的作用”，“具有伟大的现实意义”，等等。真不知人间有羞耻事！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙，对毛泽东思想疯狂地诋毁和反对。他们一再诬蔑毛泽东思想是所谓“教条主义”，叫嚷“现在党内把毛泽东思想当成教条的大有人在”。他们公然反对在党员教材中引用毛主席的言论，并由旧中宣部发通知，下禁令，不准在报刊宣传中提“毛泽东思想”。旧中宣部阎王殿的阎王们在审稿时，一见到“毛泽东思想”几个字，就歇斯底里大发作，立即砍掉。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，采取各种卑鄙的手段，强使全党和全国人民学他的《修养》。
    《修养》再版一出笼，他就伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，把《修养》定为干部“必读书”之一。旧中宣部接连转发许多地区和部门组织学《修养》的“通知”，大肆鼓吹学《修养》如何如何“必要”；规定把《修养》作为“经常学习的必读文件”、“党团课教材”；强令“各级党委暂时停止过去布置的各种学习”，“立即组织全体党员和党外干部认真地进行学习讨论和座谈”；还规定“要联系思想作风”，“进行对照检查”。还要报刊辟专栏，要电台举办《修养》的专题讲座，大肆宣扬学《修养》的“甜头”，等等。
    另一方面，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派对广大群众学习毛主席著作，却恨得要死，怕得要命。他千方百计地镇压学习毛主席著作的群众运动。他恶毒地攻击工农兵学习毛主席著作是什么“二杆子学理论”，叫嚷什么“现在学毛选，出现了一种形式主义，这样下去，会弄虚作假”。他不准在报刊上刊登学习毛主席著作的笔记，说什么“写千万字的笔记，千万不要宣传”。他指使旧中宣部从一九六一年到一九六六年春，接二连三地炮制了一系列压制学习毛主席著作的文件，经他批准发到全党。在这些文件中，抛出了反对所谓“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”、“实用主义”、“社会强制”等等一大堆棍子，穷凶极恶地进行镇压。
    随着学习毛主席著作群众运动的开展，广大群众越来越如饥似渴地要求得到最心爱的宝书。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却百般阻挠毛主席著作的出版。一九六一年底，有人提出要多印毛主席著作，他断然反对说，“纸张紧张”。反革命修正主义分子陆定一也叫嚷：“《毛泽东选集》一千多万套还不够，那么怪”，“出版得要规定政策，这样下去不行”，“要提高定价”。
    从一九六一年到一九六四年，旧中宣部起草了所谓《关于编印毛主席著作批准手续的通知》等三个文件，蛮横地规定各部门、各地区不得编印和出版毛主席著作。在这种情况下，群众要得到一本《毛泽东选集》，比登天还难。广大群众纷纷来信，强烈地要求增印毛主席著作。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙，根本不予理睬。一九六五年初，旧中宣部发现全国冶金系统职工翻印了三万册《毛主席语录》后，甚至勒令从职工手中强行把语录全部收回烧毁。
    与此相反，旧中宣部、旧文化部却发出通知，布置印发各种开本、各种字号、各种文字的《修养》，宣布各地可以自行排印、自行确定印数和发行方式。《修养》再版从一九六二年出笼以来，年年增加印数，并降价倾销。其结果是：
    一九六二年，《毛泽东选集》在国内一本也没有发行，而《修养》再版仅从九月到十二月，就印了四百七十三万三千册。
    从一九六二年九月到一九六六年七月，《修养》印了一千八百四十万册，而《毛泽东选集》只印了四百四十一万九千套。
    从全国解放到一九六六年上半年，《修养》总印数高达两千零五十四万一千册，而《毛泽东选集》只印了一千一百四十二万五千套。
    旧中宣部还极力把《修养》向八十多个国家和地区兜售。一九六二年以来，他们就用七种外文出版了十九万册，还计划新增五种外文版。但是六年多来，《毛泽东选集》第四卷只用四种外文出版了十六万八千册。
    以上事实说明，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙，利用他们所窃取的领导权，在宣传出版领域中，实行资产阶级专政。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推进到一个崭新的阶段，毛主席著作也大量地出版发行了。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派连同他的《修养》，被广大革命群众的铁扫帚扫进了历史的垃圾堆。这就是历史对他的宣判！
