More than ten thousand workers in Hong Kong launched a massive joint strike starting on June 10, resolutely countering the British imperialists' mad provocations against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

Workers from the British institutions in Hong Kong and some British-owned enterprises, totaling more than ten thousand, began a massive joint strike on June 10. They are firmly countering the British imperialists' mad provocations against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The strikers include workers from the Hong Kong British institutions and British-owned dairy companies, Star Ferry, and the Chinese Gas Company. The workers participating in this strike are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the strike struggle, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide every action of the strike.

The strike by the waterworks workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon has made it impossible for the Hong Kong British authorities to enforce their restriction of water supply to residents for only eight hours a day. The Hong Kong British "Waterworks Department" is in a state of panic, trying to recruit people to work, but they are firmly rejected by the workers. On the morning of June 10, the Hong Kong British authorities sent dozens of "riot control vehicles" to the vicinity of the waterworks factory in Wan Chai to intimidate the workers, but the workers still insisted on the strike.

The workers of the Hong Kong British "Marine Department," who have been on strike since June 1, broke through the threats of "suspension of work and pay" by the Hong Kong British authorities and the intimidation by special agents, and firmly joined the ranks of the strike.

In the "June 8" massacre, 450 workers from the electrical engineering department of the Hong Kong British "Public Works Department" in Kowloon and the Hong Kong headquarters were illegally arrested by the Hong Kong British authorities. On June 10, when the strike was held, the Hong Kong British authorities sent "riot control teams" to surround these two factories. However, the workers of the two factories, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly defied the fascist thugs' intimidation and bravely held the strike.

On June 10, street cleaners stopped working. They said that the Hong Kong British authorities would "upgrade" their persecution, making Hong Kong a "stinking port," and the responsibility for this would entirely fall on Dai Linzhi. The workers of the Red Magnetic Cleaning Department and the To Kwa Wan Road Department posted strike notices during the strike: "We, all public employees and other public service workers, will jointly launch a massive strike from now on, smashing the British imperialist reactionary rule."

Postal, road, and drainage workers also participated in the strike.

The workers from various departments of the British-owned dairy company, including the cow shed, meat, refrigeration, and milk delivery departments, participated in the strike. The workers from the cow shed department stopped work from 2 a.m. to 5 p.m. Starting from June 10, the workers stopped supplying milk and meat to British officials in Hong Kong institutions, saying, "We absolutely cannot let the enemy drink the milk we workers squeeze from the cows and then go on to suppress our compatriots."

The workers of the Star Ferry and the Chinese Gas Company, who had already stopped work to protest against the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities a few days ago, also joined the joint strike starting from June 10.

On June 10, another 3,000 shoe industry workers stopped work for a day to strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities.

The Hong Kong British authorities, frightened by the massive strike, were like ants in a hot pan, extremely anxious. They tried to lure workers back to work one moment and then issued "ceasefire" letters to the striking workers the next, attempting to sabotage the workers' strike struggle. However, the striking workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely foiled the enemy's plot to sabotage the strike.

The flames of the Hong Kong compatriots' anti-British and anti-fascist struggle also blazed fiercely in the nearby Hong Kong islands of Lamma, Lantau, and Tai O. On the evening of June 10, fishermen, farmers, women, and merchants from Tai O held a meeting and solemnly announced the establishment of the Tai O Water and Land Residents' Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee. The meeting issued a statement angrily denouncing the British imperialists' heinous crimes.

About 700 representatives of Hong Kong British institution workers and workers from various industries held a joint meeting in the morning of June 10 to condemn the British fascist atrocities. When the meeting was about to end, the voice of the motherland came—an article by the editorial board of the People's Daily: "Firmly Oppose, Resolutely Struggle." The entire venue immediately erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee, Yang Guang, read this article to the audience, and was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause. Especially when reading "All workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and all revolutionary masses across the country must be fully prepared to support the struggle of the Hong Kong compatriots with practical actions," the entire venue boiled over, and people, with tears of excitement, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The East is Red."

The representatives attending the meeting, with hearts full of indignation, strongly protested against the British fascist authorities' bloody suppression of Hong Kong workers and the Silver Theatre on June 8 and 9. They expressed their determination to firmly respond to the great call of the motherland, make all preparations, and launch a high tide of movements to despise, hate, and scorn British imperialism, and launch a more powerful counterattack against the enemy.

Representatives from various industries spoke at the meeting about the vivid examples of how workers in various industries, in the previous stage of the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, used big-character posters as a new weapon, greatly dispelled the enemy's arrogance, and greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people. They pointed out that the anti-British struggle of Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots further proved Chairman Mao's correct judgment that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Hong Kong workers have deeply felt through the struggle that only by firmly grasping Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful ideological weapon, can the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle achieve victory.

On the evening of June 4, representatives of Chinese workers from Hong Kong British institutions held a meeting to warmly celebrate the victory of the Hong Kong British institution workers' anti-persecution struggle army's united front. The workers, in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, raised their hands and swore: Firmly respond to the call of the great motherland and fight the anti-persecution struggle to the end!

    坚决回击英帝对我港九爱国同胞的疯狂挑衅
    香港一万多工人联合大罢工
    他们在斗争中深深体会到：只有牢牢掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，反英抗暴斗争才能取得胜利
    据新华社香港十二日电　香港英国机构中国工人和一些英资企业中国工人共一万多人，从十日开始举行声势浩大的联合大罢工，坚决回击英帝国主义对我港九爱国同胞的疯狂挑衅。
    参加联合罢工的有港英机构工人和英资牛奶公司、天星渡轮和中华煤气有限公司的工人。参加这次大罢工的工人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持在罢工斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指导罢工斗争的每一个行动。
    港九水务工人的大罢工，使港英当局对居民每天只供水八小时的限制无法执行。港英“水务局”狼狈不堪，到处拉人上工，遭到工人的坚决拒绝。十日上午，港英当局曾出动十几车的“防暴队”到湾仔道水务工厂附近对工人进行恫吓，但工人仍坚持罢工。
    六月一日就开始停工的港英“海事处”工人，冲破港英当局“停职停薪”的威胁和特务恐吓，坚决参加了大罢工的行列。
    在“六·八”血案中被港英当局非法逮捕了四百五十名工人的港英“工务局”电器机构工程部九龙分厂以及香港总厂的工人，十日举行罢工时，港英当局曾派出“防暴队”包围这两个工厂，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的两厂工人毫不畏惧，他们蔑视法西斯暴徒的恐吓，勇敢地举行了罢工。
    清道工人十日纷纷停止工作。他们说，港英当局将迫害大“升级”，使香港变成“臭港”这个责任完全要由戴麟趾负。红磡清洁部和土瓜湾马路部的工人在罢工时，分别贴出罢工通知：“我们全体公务员及其他公共事业工人，由即日起联合大罢工，粉碎英帝反动统治”。
    邮务、马路和渠务工人也参加了大罢工。
    英资牛奶公司参加罢工的，包括牛房、肉食、冷藏、派奶等部门的工人。其中牛房部工人从凌晨二时至下午五时停工。从十日起，工人们对港英机构英籍官员停止牛奶和肉食，他们说：“我们绝不能让敌人喝饱了我们工人榨的牛奶，然后去镇压自己的同胞。”
    前几天已经停工抗议港英当局暴行的天星渡轮工人和中华煤气有限公司工人，从十日起也参加了联合大罢工。
    十日，还有三千名鞋业工人停工一天对港英当局的法西斯暴行表示强烈抗议。
    被大罢工吓破了胆的港英当局，象热锅上的蚂蚁，焦急万分，一会儿诱骗工人复工，一会儿又向罢工工人发“停战书”，妄图破坏工人的罢工斗争。但是，罢工工人遵循毛主席的教导，坚决粉碎了敌人破坏罢工的阴谋。
    香港同胞反英抗暴斗争的烈火在邻近香港的海山大屿山大澳地区也熊熊地燃烧起来。六月十日晚上，大澳渔民、农民、妇女和商人代表举行集会，庄严宣告大澳水陆居民反迫害斗争委员会成立。会议发表声明愤怒控诉英帝国主义的滔天罪行。
    约七百名港英机构工人代表和各业工人代表，十日上午联合举行了声讨港英法西斯暴行大会。会议将要结束的时候，传来了祖国的声音——《人民日报》评论员文章：《针锋相对，坚决斗争》。全场立刻爆发出春雷般的掌声和欢呼声。港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会主任杨光在向大家宣读这篇文章的时候，不断为热烈的掌声所打断，特别是读到“全国的工人、农民、人民解放军战士和一切革命群众，都要做好充分的准备，用实际行动来支援香港同胞的斗争”时，全场沸腾，人们含着激动的眼泪一再振臂高呼“毛主席万岁！”并且高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    出席大会的代表怀着万分愤怒的心情，强烈抗议港英法西斯当局在八日和九日先后向香港工人以及银都戏院进行疯狂的血腥镇压，表示要坚决响应祖国的伟大号召，做好一切准备，掀起蔑视、仇视、鄙视英帝国主义的运动的高潮，向敌人展开更强大的反击。
    各业工人代表在会上畅谈各业工人在前一阶段反英抗暴斗争中，活学活用毛泽东思想，运用大字报这个新式武器，大灭敌人威风，大长中国人民志气的生动事迹。他们指出，香港工人和爱国同胞的抗英斗争，进一步证明了毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。香港工人从斗争中深深体会到，只有牢牢掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，反英抗暴斗争才能取得胜利。（附图片）
    港英机构的中国工人代表四日晚举行集会，热烈庆祝港英机构工人反迫害斗争大军的胜利会师。工人们在伟大领袖毛主席像前举手宣誓：坚决响应伟大祖国的号召，誓把反迫害斗争进行到底！			                新华社稿（传真照片）
