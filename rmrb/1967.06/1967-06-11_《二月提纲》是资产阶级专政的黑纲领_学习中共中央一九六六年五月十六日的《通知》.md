The "February Outline" is a Black Program for the Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie
—Studying the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which uses the sharp weapon of Marxism-Leninism to expose the reactionary essence of the "February Outline" concocted by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique with the support of the number one capitalist-roadier in the Party. The Circular, this great historical document, points out in a penetrating manner that the "February Outline" is a thoroughgoing revisionist program, a program for the restoration of capitalism.

	In the clear sky of socialism, why did such a black program for the restoration of capitalism appear? This was certainly not accidental.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." In the seventeen years since liberation, on this piece of Chinese land, there has always been a struggle between two classes—the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, two headquarters—the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, two lines—the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. This struggle has not stopped for a single year, month, or day.

	In November 1965, the Shanghai Wenhui Daily published Yao Wenyuan's article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office.'" This was the signal that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country was about to rise. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, with their counter-revolutionary instincts, sensed that a Cultural Revolution sweeping the nation would sweep away the ideological and cultural positions they had occupied. They were afraid of losing the great power they had over the Party, government, finance, and culture, and afraid that their dream of restoring capitalism would be shattered. Therefore, the publication of Yao Wenyuan's article made the big bureaucrat Peng Zhen fly into a rage. He repeatedly criticized the revolutionary proletarians of Shanghai for not "consulting the Propaganda Department" before publishing Yao Wenyuan's article. "Where has their Party spirit gone?" At a meeting, the black boss of the "Three Family Village," Deng Tuo, told Peng Zhen: "Wu Han is very nervous now because he knows this criticism has a big background." Peng Zhen, his anger rising, shouted: "What background? We don't care about that! We only ask about the truth. Truth is equal before all!" Peng Zhen dared to openly oppose our beloved great leader Chairman Mao. How arrogant his counter-revolutionary arrogance was!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces...." The Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique represents precisely such a doomed reactionary force. Seeing that the flames of the Cultural Revolution were about to engulf them, they struggled desperately in every possible way. They knew that to maintain their counter-revolutionary positions and to let their lackeys slip through, they had to seize the leadership of the Cultural Revolution firmly in their own hands. In this way, they could guide the movement onto the bourgeois track, protect all kinds of ghosts and monsters in society, and give the green light to the spread of poisonous weeds. They could strike down and suppress the proletarian leftists with one slap. To achieve this despicable goal, they stopped at nothing and hurriedly concocted in February 1966 a so-called report outline that was completely opposed to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They arrogantly, behind Chairman Mao's back, stole the name of the Central Committee and issued this infamous "February Outline" to the entire Party with great haste.

	The "February Outline" tried to cover up the crucial political issue of the struggle between the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the prevention of restoration by the proletariat. It attempted to turn a serious political struggle into a bourgeois "purely academic" discussion, thereby obstructing the proletariat's all-out counterattack against the bourgeoisie and strangling the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in its cradle.

	As an important part of the superstructure, ideology is a very important battlefield for the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the prevention of restoration by the proletariat. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is not about fighting "pen battles," but is concentrated on the question of seizing power. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a government, public opinion must first be created, and ideological work must first be done. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Chairman Mao's wise judgment ruthlessly tears off the bourgeois "purely academic" disguise, completely exposes the secrets of class struggle in the ideological realm, and fundamentally exposes the treacherous plots of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party to usurp the Party and the government.

	As early as December 1965, Chairman Mao pointed out in a penetrating manner that Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was a case of rehabilitating right-opportunists. He said: "The key issue in 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' is 'dismissal.' The Jiaqing Emperor dismissed Hai Rui from office, and in 1959 we dismissed Peng Dehuai from office. Peng Dehuai is also a 'Hai Rui.'"

	The "February Outline" used the trick of switching heaven and earth to conceal Chairman Mao's important directive, cover up the serious political nature of this struggle, and deliberately distort the struggle between the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the prevention of restoration by the proletariat into a "purely academic" discussion, a discussion of "differing opinions."

	Are there really such "purely academic" discussions in the world? Are there really such discussions of "differing opinions"?

	The Circular emphasizes to us the Marxist basic principle that all class struggles are political struggles.

	Is it "purely academic" discussion for Wu Han to use the new historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to rehabilitate the anti-Party, anti-socialist right-opportunists Peng Dehuai and viciously attack our great leader Chairman Mao?

	Is it "purely academic" discussion for the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party to collude with reactionary bourgeois "authorities" and use newspapers, radio, periodicals, books, textbooks, lectures, literary works, films, plays, folk arts, fine arts, music, and dance to spread a large amount of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist reactionary culture to corrupt the broad masses and our cadres, create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism?

	Is it a discussion of "differing opinions" for you to brazenly oppose the Party, oppose socialism, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, viciously attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat?

	You madly shout, "Let all kinds of different opinions (including anti-Marxist things) come out fully"; you maliciously advocate expanding the scope of the discussion, lengthening the battle line, "not limiting the discussion in newspapers to political issues, but fully developing the discussion of all kinds of academic and theoretical issues"; you also want various newspapers to publish more summaries of academic discussions, so that readers can "watch it like a big world...." You play all kinds of tricks, is it really to "advance academic studies"?

	No! You have already exposed your wolfish ambitions. The purpose of all your tricks is to confuse the class lines, shift the target of the struggle, and "lead a chaotic battle" so that the broad masses can fall into the smoke of your so-called "purely academic" discussion from the thrilling class struggle; it is to take the opportunity to muddy the waters, protect all kinds of bourgeois representatives to slip through, and use the publication of "differing opinions" to incite all kinds of ghosts and monsters to continue their savage attacks on the proletariat.

	The reactionary nature of the "February Outline" lies not only in the fact that it does not allow the proletariat to exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie and does not allow the proletariat to counterattack the bourgeoisie in the ideological and cultural realm, but also in the fact that it openly directs the struggle against the proletarian leftists, carrying out ruthless struggle and merciless blows against the leftists.

	When Chairman Mao initiated this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he repeatedly pointed out that the leftists must be protected and supported, and a leftist force must be established and expanded. However, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, openly opposed Chairman Mao's directive. They were extremely hostile to the proletarian, fighting new forces. They regarded the proletarian leftists as thorns in their eyes and thorns in their flesh, determined to annihilate them. Once they succeeded, they would launch a counterattack. The "February Outline" has already shown its murderous intent. People can already hear the howling of these wolves. They planted all kinds of "nails" in the "February Outline," labeling the proletarian leftists with all kinds of crimes, such as "not allowing revolution," "acting like academic despots and using power to suppress people," "thoroughly clean up" the leftist forces, and "rectify" the leftists, etc. The Circular deeply exposes that they use these counter-revolutionary methods to "boost the morale of the bourgeois rightists and suppress the morale of the proletarian leftists. They are full of hatred for the proletariat and full of love for the bourgeoisie. This is the bourgeois philanthropy of the authors of the outline."

	There is no love or hatred without reason in the world. It is not surprising that the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party are full of love for the bourgeoisie and full of hatred for the proletariat. The class enemies clearly understand: the proletarian leftists must resolutely struggle against the bourgeois academic "authorities," seize back all the ideological and cultural positions they have usurped, and inevitably chase after their ultimate backer, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. Without striking down the proletarian leftists, their dream of implementing bourgeois dictatorship and restoring capitalism can never be realized.

	Why, at the moment when the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was about to come, did Peng Zhen dare to throw out this revisionist "February Outline"?

	This is because behind the counter-revolutionary conspirator Peng Zhen, there is a "giant" backing him up—the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. This Chinese Khrushchev is the backstage boss who concocted and promoted the "February Outline."

	The "February Outline" was revised and finalized with his participation, carefully concocted with his support, and issued to the entire Party with his support, stealing the name of the Central Committee and poisoning the entire country.

	The "February Outline" is the program of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party to suppress the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, restore capitalism, and implement bourgeois dictatorship.

	When the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was vigorously developing, he was so eager to dispatch work teams, using the names of "catching stray fish," "anti-interference," and "catching political thieves" to label a large number of revolutionary pioneers as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," and "fake leftists, real rightists." Is this not striking down the revolutionary masses, suppressing the revolutionary mass movement, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship? In the matter of cadres, he was so arrogant in striking down a large number of revolutionary cadres as "black gang members," while showing great concern and strict protection for the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. Is this not confusing right and wrong, mixing black and white, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship? The reactionary line of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is precisely a replica of the counter-revolutionary "February Outline."

	The great historical document of Marxism-Leninism formulated under the personal direction of Chairman Mao—the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China—deeply exposes and criticizes the "February Outline," pointing out: "This outline is against carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, against the cultural revolutionary line of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, striking down the proletarian leftists, shielding the bourgeois rightists, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. This outline is the reflection of bourgeois ideology in the Party, a thoroughgoing revisionism. The struggle against this revisionist line is not a small matter, but a matter of the fate of our Party and state, the future of our Party and state, the future appearance of our Party and state, and also a top priority for the world revolution."

	The birth of the Circular signals the death of the "February Outline." However, as Lenin once said: the situation is not like that of a person's death, where the corpse is simply carried out and that's the end of it. Its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us.

	To thoroughly purge the reactionary bourgeois ideology of the "February Outline," the most powerful weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great historical document personally led by our great leader Chairman Mao—the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Today, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, we should seriously study this document, further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strive to improve the level of struggle, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and criticize them to the end. At the same time, we must persistently arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly eliminate private interests and establish public interests, and resist the infiltration and influence of various bourgeois ideologies on the revolutionary ranks. We must especially be vigilant against various bourgeois ideologies attacking our revolutionary ranks from the "left" and the right, disrupting the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, and shaking our proletarian headquarters. We must, as Lenin taught, resolutely struggle against all bourgeois ideologies, no matter how fashionable and beautiful their new clothes are. We must steadfastly and unyieldingly advance along the course indicated by Chairman Mao!

    《二月提纲》是资产阶级专政的黑纲领
    ——学习中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》
    任立新
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，运用马克思列宁主义的锐利武器，把在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持下由彭真反革命修正主义集团炮制的《二月提纲》的反动本质揭露无遗。《通知》这个伟大的历史文件一针见血地指出，《二月提纲》是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，是一个资本主义复辟的纲领。
    在社会主义明朗的天空下，为什么会出现这样一个资本主义复辟的黑纲领？这绝不是偶然的。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”解放十七年来，在中国这块土地上，始终贯穿着两个阶级——无产阶级和资产阶级，两个司令部——无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部，两条路线——以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线的斗争。这个斗争，没有哪一年，哪一月，哪一天停止过。
    一九六五年十一月，上海《文汇报》发表了姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的文章。这是我国无产阶级文化大革命即将兴起的讯号。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彭真反革命修正主义集团，凭着他们反革命的嗅觉，预感到一场席卷全国的文化大革命的滚滚洪流，将会冲垮他们已经霸占的思想文化阵地。他们害怕失去已经抓到手里的党、政、财、文大权，害怕复辟资本主义的美梦从此就要破灭。因此，姚文元同志文章的发表，使彭真这个大党阀暴跳如雷。他多次指责上海的无产阶级革命派，为什么发表姚文元的文章“不和中宣部打招呼”？“他们的党性哪里去了？”在一次会议上，“三家村”的黑掌柜邓拓告诉彭真说：“吴晗现在很紧张，因为他知道这次批判有来头。”这时，彭真火冒三丈地大声说：“什么来头不来头，不用管，只问真理如何？真理面前人人平等。”彭真胆敢公开对抗我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，他的反革命气焰何等嚣张！
    毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，……”。彭真反革命修正主义集团所代表的，正是这样一股将要灭亡的反动势力。他们眼看一场文化大革命的熊熊烈火就要烧到自己身上了，他们千方百计地作拚死的挣扎。他们知道，要想保持自己的反革命阵地，要想使自己的娄罗蒙混过关，就一定要把文化大革命的领导权牢牢地抓到自己的手里。这样，他们就能够把这场运动纳入资产阶级的轨道，就可以对社会上的牛鬼蛇神大加保护，对毒草出笼大开绿灯。他们就可以打击和压制无产阶级左派，一个巴掌把他们打了下去。为了达到这一卑鄙目的，他们不择手段，急急忙忙地在一九六六年二月炮制了一个完全同毛主席的革命路线相对抗的所谓汇报提纲，并且狂妄已极地背着毛主席，盗用中央的名义，把这个臭名昭著的《二月提纲》“火速发给全党”。
    《二月提纲》极力掩盖资产阶级复辟同无产阶级反复辟斗争这个政治要害问题，妄图把一场严重的政治斗争，纳入资产阶级“纯学术”讨论的轨道，从而阻挠无产阶级对资产阶级的全面反攻，把一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命扼杀在摇篮之中。
    作为上层建筑重要组成部分的意识形态，是资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的一个十分重要的战场。无产阶级同资产阶级在意识形态领域里所进行的阶级斗争，决不是什么打“笔墨官司”，而是集中地表现在争夺政权的问题上。毛主席教导我们说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”毛主席的英明论断，无情地撕破了资产阶级的所谓“纯学术”的画皮，彻底揭开了意识形态领域里的阶级斗争的全部秘密，从根本上戳穿了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派妄图篡党篡政的阴谋诡计。
    早在一九六五年十二月，毛主席就一针见血地指出，吴晗的《海瑞罢官》是替右倾机会主义分子翻案。他说：《海瑞罢官》的“要害问题是‘罢官’。嘉靖皇帝罢了海瑞的官，一九五九年我们罢了彭德怀的官。彭德怀也是‘海瑞’。”
    《二月提纲》用偷天换日的手法，隐瞒毛主席的这个重要指示，掩盖这场斗争的严重政治性质，故意把资产阶级复辟同无产阶级反复辟的斗争歪曲成什么“纯学术”讨论，歪曲成什么“不同意见的讨论”。
    世界上真有这样的“纯学术”讨论吗？真有这样的“不同意见的讨论”吗？
    《通知》向我们强调了一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争这个马克思主义的基本原理。
    难道吴晗利用新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》替反党反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子彭德怀翻案，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席，是“纯学术”讨论吗？
    难道党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结反动的资产阶级学术“权威”，利用报纸、广播、刊物、书籍、教科书、讲演、文艺作品、电影、戏剧、曲艺、美术、音乐、舞蹈等等大量散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的反动文化，来腐蚀广大群众和我们的干部，为复辟资本主义制造舆论，也是什么“纯学术”讨论吗？
    难道你们猖狂地反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想，恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，也是什么“不同意见的讨论”吗？
    你们疯狂地叫嚷，“要让各种不同的意见（包括反马克思主义的东西）都充分地放出来”；你们别有用心地鼓吹要把“题目扩大，战线拉长”，“在报刊上的讨论不要局限于政治问题，要把涉及到各种学术理论的问题，充分地展开讨论”；你们还要各个报刊多登学术讨论摘要，要让读者“象看大世界一样，……。”你们玩弄这一切阴谋诡计，难道真是为了“把学术推进”吗？
    不！你们自己早已经暴露了狼子野心，你们玩弄种种障眼法的目的，就是要混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争目标，“有领导的造成一场混战”，使广大群众离开惊心动魄的阶级斗争，坠入你们所设置的“纯学术”讨论的烟海；就是要乘机把水搅浑，保护形形色色的资产阶级代表人物蒙混过关，并以发表“不同意见”为名，鼓动各种牛鬼蛇神继续向无产阶级猖狂进攻。
    《二月提纲》的反动性，不仅在于它不准无产阶级对资产阶级实行专政，不准无产阶级在思想文化领域里反击资产阶级的进攻，而且它还公开地把斗争的矛头直接对准无产阶级左派，对左派实行残酷斗争，无情打击。
    毛主席在开始发动这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的时候，就多次指出，要保护左派，支持左派，建立和扩大左派队伍。但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彭真反革命修正主义集团，公然对抗毛主席的指示，他们极端仇视无产阶级的、战斗的新生力量。他们把无产阶级左派看成眼中钉，肉中刺，必欲置之死地而后快。一旦得手，他们就要反攻倒算。《二月提纲》已经露出杀机，人们已经可以听到这些豺狼的磨砺声。他们在《二月提纲》中，安下了种种“钉子”，给无产阶级左派定下了种种罪名，什么“不准革命”，“象学阀一样武断和以势压人”，要“彻底清理”左派队伍，对左派进行“整风”，等等。《通知》深刻地揭露，他们使用这种反革命的手法，就是“企图长资产阶级右派的志气，灭无产阶级左派的威风。他们对无产阶级充满了恨，对资产阶级充满了爱。这就是提纲作者们的资产阶级的博爱观。”
    世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对资产阶级充满了爱，对无产阶级充满了恨，这是毫不奇怪的。阶级敌人很清楚地懂得：无产阶级左派要对资产阶级学术“权威”进行坚决的斗争，要夺回被他们窃踞的一切思想文化阵地，就势必要追到他们的总后台，追到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。不把无产阶级左派打下去，他们推行资产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的美梦是永远不能实现的。
    为什么当无产阶级文化大革命的暴风骤雨即将来临的时刻，彭真竟敢胆大包天，抛出这个修正主义的
  《二月提纲》呢？
    这是因为，反革命阴谋家彭真的背后，还有一个给他撑腰的“庞然大物”——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，就是炮制和推行《二月提纲》的后台老板。
    《二月提纲》是在他的参与下修改定稿的，是在他的支持下精心炮制出来的，也是在他的支持下盗用中央名义加了批示以后发到全党，流毒全国的。
    《二月提纲》就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派镇压无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，就是他反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义、推行资产阶级专政的纲领。
    当无产阶级文化大革命群众运动蓬蓬勃勃开展起来的时候，他那样迫不及待地大派工作组，以“抓游鱼”、“反干扰”、“抓政治扒手”为名，把大批革命闯将打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“假左派、真右派”，这难道不是打击革命群众，镇压革命的群众运动，实行资产阶级专政吗？在干部问题上，他那样猖狂地实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，把大批革命干部打成“黑帮分子”，而对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派则关怀备至，严加保护，这难道不是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，实行资产阶级专政吗？党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派抛出的这条资产阶级反动路线，正是反革命《二月提纲》的翻版。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的马克思列宁主义的伟大历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，深刻揭露和批判了《二月提纲》，指出：“这个提纲是反对把社会主义革命进行到底，反对以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的文化革命路线，打击无产阶级左派，包庇资产阶级右派，为资产阶级复辟作舆论准备。这个提纲是资产阶级思想在党内的反映，是彻头彻尾的修正主义。同这条修正主义路线作斗争，绝对不是一件小事，而是关系我们党和国家的命运，关系我们党和国家的前途，关系我们党和国家将来的面貌，也是关系世界革命的一件头等大事。”
    《通知》的诞生，宣告了《二月提纲》的死亡。但是，正如列宁曾经说过的：情形并不象一个人死的时候那样，只要把死尸抬出去就完事了。它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。
    要彻底肃清《二月提纲》的资产阶级反动思想，最锐利的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导制定的伟大的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》。在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的今天，我们应该认真的学习这个文件，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，努力提高斗争水平，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，批倒批臭。同时，我们还必须坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断地破私立公，抵制各种资产阶级思潮对革命队伍的侵袭和影响。特别要警惕各种资产阶级思潮从“左”的方面和右的方面来冲击我们的革命队伍，破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，动摇我们无产阶级的司令部。我们一定要象列宁所教导的那样，坚决同一切资产阶级思想作斗争，不管它披着怎样时髦而华丽的新衣。坚定不移地、百折不回地沿着毛主席所指引的航向奋勇前进！
