Farmers in Hong Kong and Kowloon are actively joining the anti-imperialist struggle, determined to settle accounts with the British colonial authorities for their fascist crimes and to demand justice from the British Empire.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hong Kong on June 4, farmers in the rural areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon have taken action and joined the ranks of the anti-imperialist struggle, firmly demanding that the British colonial authorities make amends for their crimes.

The Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of various sectors in Yuen Long was officially established on June 1. The committee issued a statement calling on workers, farmers, students, and residents in various industries in Yuen Long to organize and take immediate action to carry the anti-persecution struggle to the end.

On June 1, various sectors of the community in Sha Tau Kok held a large-scale rally to condemn British atrocities in the market. Representatives from various sectors strongly protested the series of bloody incidents orchestrated by the British colonial authorities. Farmers in Sha Tau Kok also exposed the long-standing oppression and exploitation of Hong Kong farmers by the British colonial authorities, stating that old and new grievances must not be forgotten. The attendees unanimously expressed their determination to stand united with the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, to thoroughly settle the heinous crimes committed by the British colonial authorities, and to fight until victory is achieved. After the rally, the attendees, filled with indignation, posted anti-persecution slogans in various locations, including the police station, medical office, and nearby villages, set up by the British colonial authorities in Sha Tau Kok.

Residents of Tin Au, Chun Uk, and Luk Uk in the Tai Po district held rallies to condemn the British colonial authorities' fascist bloody atrocities on the night of May 30, following similar rallies in Lung Wei and Lau Shui Tong.
