Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao received a letter on June 18 from Li Songshan, deputy commander of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, congratulating China on the successful explosion of its first hydrogen bomb.

In his congratulatory letter, Li Songshan said, “The successful test of China’s first hydrogen bomb marks a new stage in the development of China’s modern national defense science. It plays a significant role in greatly strengthening the national defense forces of the People’s Republic of China. At the same time, it is a tremendous encouragement to the people of South Vietnam and all peoples of the world who are bravely fighting against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism, striving for national liberation, and defending world peace.

“The victory of the first hydrogen bomb test, like the previous victories in nuclear weapon tests, is a victory of the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao. It is a great victory achieved by the seven hundred million Chinese people through studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao.”

The letter wishes the Chinese People’s Liberation Army more brilliant victories in its national defense modernization efforts and greater contributions to opposing imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and defending world peace.

On June 18, Li Songshan, deputy commander of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, visited the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He expressed warm congratulations on behalf of all the staff to China for the successful explosion of its first hydrogen bomb. Li Songshan said that China’s victory is a great encouragement to the people of South Vietnam in their struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong and the result of the seven hundred million Chinese people studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. He expressed his belief that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will achieve even greater victories.

According to Xinhua News Agency on June 20, the delegation of the Malayan National Liberation League in China issued a statement on China’s successful explosion of its first hydrogen bomb. The statement pointed out that this hydrogen bomb explosion brought boundless joy, encouragement, and confidence to the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world. This brilliant achievement fully proves the profound wisdom and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the greatest leader of the Chinese and world revolution.

The statement said that the Malayan people believe that China’s astonishing development in nuclear armaments has thoroughly and completely broken the nuclear monopoly of the U.S., British imperialists, and Soviet modern revisionists, and has dealt a heavy blow to their nuclear blackmail.
