Western Europe Opposes U.S. Hegemony, Rejects Anglo-American Influence

De Gaulle Reiterates Independence from the U.S., Opposes Britain's Entry into the "Common Market"

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Paris, French President Charles de Gaulle, in a press conference in mid-May, reiterated France's "independence" from the United States and emphasized France's opposition to Britain's entry into the "Common Market."

De Gaulle reiterated that the main goal of France's foreign policy is to continue a policy of contention with both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He indicated that France's European policy is to exclude American and British influence in Western Europe on one hand, and to achieve "east-west détente, coordination, and cooperation" on the other, in order to promote the peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, ultimately bringing them into France's orbit.

In this press conference, De Gaulle focused on the issue of Britain's recent formal reapplication to join the "Common Market." Although he did not directly reject Britain's application, his opposition was clear. He listed several reasons that essentially opposed Britain's entry, such as Britain's close ties with the United States, Britain's special relationship with the Commonwealth, and the instability of the pound. He said that only when these situations change would Britain's entry into the "Common Market" be appropriate.

The British government formally reapplied to join the "Common Market," the "Coal and Steel Community," and the "Euratom" on May 11. As early as 1961, Britain had made its first application, but due to its "special relationship" with the United States, it was rejected by France; now it is forcing its way back into the door of the six-nation European community, indicating that Britain has fallen into a desperate situation.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Paris on May 30, the six nations of the Western European "Common Market" held a summit meeting in Rome on May 29 and 30.

This meeting was held to "celebrate" the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaty establishing the "Common Market." The main topics of discussion were the issue of "political cooperation" among the six nations and Britain's application to join the "Common Market."

The meeting finally decided to hold another summit meeting within the year and instructed the six foreign ministers to meet to study the possibility of gradually strengthening political ties among the six nations. Although this decision only involves procedural matters, it has changed the previous state of complete stagnation in the six nations' political "cooperation." It can be predicted that as the six nations' political cooperation advances, their centrifugal tendencies toward the United States will also increase.

On the issue of Britain's entry into the "Common Market," France adopted a delaying tactic. Even before this meeting was held, French President Charles de Gaulle had already set stringent conditions for Britain's entry into the "Common Market" in a press conference. At this meeting, France again emphasized that the six nations need "sufficient time," and they must first study the "various consequences" of Britain's entry into the "Common Market" in the Council of Ministers and reach a consensus, before they can negotiate with Britain. Although the British Labour government tried to exploit the contradictions within the six nations to divide and conquer in dealing with France, the other member nations of the "Common Market" are not willing to break with France over this, and they are also concerned that Britain's entry will harm the interests of the group.

Under these circumstances, the meeting could only decide to hand the issue of Britain's entry over to the Council of Ministers for further study. This indicates that the struggle within the imperialist camp over the issue of Britain's entry into the "Common Market" has begun with Britain already at a disadvantage.

    西欧反对美国霸权，排斥美英势力
    戴高乐重申要对美国保持独立，反对英国打入“共同市场”
    据新华社巴黎电　法国总统戴高乐在五月中旬的记者招待会上谈到法国的外交政策时，重申法国保持对美国的“独立”，并且着重地阐述了法国实质上反对英国加入“共同市场”的态度。
    戴高乐重申法国对外政策的主要目标是要继续执行同美、苏争霸的政策。他表明，法国的欧洲政策是一方面在西欧排斥美国和英国的势力，另一方面要实现“东西欧缓和、协调与合作”，以便促进苏联和东欧国家彻底和平演变，最后把它们拉入法国的轨道。
    戴高乐在这次记者招待会上着重地谈了英国最近正式重新申请加入“共同市场”的问题。他虽然没有正面拒绝英国的申请，但是他反对的态度却是很明显的。他列举了许多实质上是反对英国加入的理由，如英国同美国联系太密切，英国同英联邦有特别关系，英镑地位不稳等等，他说，只有这些情况改变了，英国加入“共同市场”才是适宜的。
    英国政府是在五月十一日再次正式申请参加西欧六国“共同市场”、“煤钢联营”和“原子能联营”集团的。早在一九六一年，英国就曾提出过第一次申请，但是由于它同美国的“特殊关系”而被法国拒于门外；现在它硬着头皮再一次敲西欧六国集团的门，表明英国已经陷入走投无路的窘境之中。
    据新华社巴黎一日电西欧“共同市场”六国在五月二十九日和三十日在罗马举行了首脑会议。
    这次会议是以“庆祝”建立“共同市场”的罗马条约签订十周年的名义举行的。会议主要讨论了六国的“政治合作”的问题和英国申请加入“共同市场”的问题。
    会议最后决定，在今年内再举行一次首脑会议，并且责成六国外长开会研究今后六国“政治联系逐渐紧密的可能性”。人们认为，尽管这个决定只牵涉程序性问题，但是它改变了过去六国政治“合作”完全搁浅的状态。可以预料，随着六国的“政治合作”向前跨进一步，它们对美国的离心倾向也必将进一步增加。
    在英国加入“共同市场”的问题上，法国采取了拖延战术。早在这次会议召开之前，法国总统戴高乐就在记者招待会上为英国加入“共同市场”提出了苛刻的条件。在这次会议上，法国又强调六国必须有“充足时间”，它们必须先在部长理事会上研究英国加入“共同市场”的“各种后果”并且取得一致意见，然后才能同英国谈判。尽管英国工党政府竭力利用六国内部的矛盾，进行分化拉拢以对付法国，但是“共同市场”的其他成员国并不愿因此同法国闹翻，它们同时还担心英国的加入会损害这个集团的利益。
    在这种情况下，会议只能决定把英国加入的问题交给部长理事会再去研究。这表明，帝国主义阵营内围绕英国加入“共同市场”问题而进行的较量，英国一开头就输了一着。
