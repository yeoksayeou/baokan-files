	Forever Sing for the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

I am filled with immense excitement as I participated in the joint military performance. In the large-scale song and dance performance "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art," I performed a segment from "The Red Lantern" where Li Yuhe is in prison. During the process of learning and performing this segment, I received profound education. I am not familiar with Peking Opera. The old Peking Opera performances were about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, which are completely different from the revolutionary songs I love. Therefore, in the past, whenever I turned on the radio and heard old Peking Opera, I would turn it off. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, ordered us through his black hands in the military to learn old Peking Opera in 1964. The capitalist-roader in the Party also made plans for us to learn performances about emperors and generals like "The Second Entry into the Palace" and the obscene "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet." At that time, the more we learned, the less we wanted to learn, and we never really mastered it. This time, our revolutionary rebel comrades voluntarily learned revolutionary model Peking Opera, singing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, creating images of worker, peasant, and soldier heroes, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. I not only felt happy from the bottom of my heart but also felt very honored.

Revolutionary model Peking Opera and the revolutionary songs I love both praise our great leader and the great Party, and both propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The strong feelings of loving workers, peasants, and soldiers, loving Mao Zedong Thought, and loving Chairman Mao made me develop a deep affection for revolutionary model Peking Opera. Revolutionary model operas inspire me, and the image of the hero Li Yuhe inspires me. I am determined to study hard and perform Li Yuhe well. During the process of learning to sing "The Red Lantern," I encountered many difficulties: the melody was unfamiliar, the rhythm was unstable, and the pronunciation was weak. But these difficulties did not scare me. Whenever I think of Comrade Jiang Qing's spirit of bravely forging ahead in this sharp and complex struggle between the two classes and two lines, it gives me boundless strength. I am determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. After analyzing this segment of "The Red Lantern," the thoughts and feelings of the three generations of heroes—Grandma Li, Li Yuhe, and Iron Girl—strongly inspired my creative passion. I must strive in this segment to portray Li Yuhe's proletarian revolutionary aspirations, his fearlessness in the face of danger on the enemy's execution ground, and his unyielding loyalty to the revolution. Under this guiding thought, I practiced day and night and finally performed this segment in a relatively short time. Although I am still far from perfect in portraying the hero Li Yuhe, every performance has been warmly received and encouraged by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which has further strengthened my confidence.

This time, learning and performing revolutionary model operas has given me a profound education and marks a new starting point in my ideological and artistic revolution. I have realized that only by using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the stage can we truly and thoroughly seize the power in the literary and artistic field for the proletariat.

Now, we have seized the power in the literary and artistic field for the proletariat. We must also hold and use this power well. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither attacks nor sacrifice; to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, we strive every minute and fear no difficulties. If there are no works, we will create them ourselves. The revolution's needs are our commands. I will not only sing revolutionary songs loudly but also create songs for the revolution. Before the arrival of this year's Red May, I quickly composed music for twelve passages from Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Recently, after the news of our country's successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb, I immediately wrote the lyrics for the song "Celebrating the Successful Detonation of Our Country's First Hydrogen Bomb," praising the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, forever sing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, forever be loyal to the proletariat, and forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. I will defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with my blood and life, making revolutionary literature and art truly a powerful tool for proletarian dictatorship.

    永远为工农兵歌唱
    	北京部队战友文工团“临筹”老燎原战斗队　贾世骏
    我怀着万分激动的心情，参加了三军联合演出。我在大型歌舞《毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁》中的《红灯记》片断里，演出了李玉和在狱中的一段。在学习和演出这段戏的过程中，我受到很大的教育。我对京剧是很不熟悉的，旧京剧中演唱的都是帝王将相、才子佳人，和我所热爱的革命歌曲，在思想感情上格格不入。所以过去我打开收音机，一听到旧京剧就关上。可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了给资本主义复辟制造舆论，却通过他在军内的黑手，于一九六四年下令逼我们学习旧京剧。党内走资本主义道路当权派还订了计划，让我们学表现帝王将相的《二进宫》和黄色下流的《拾玉镯》。当时，我们越学越不愿学，总也没学会。而这次我们革命造反派的同志主动学习革命京剧样板戏，唱的是工农兵，塑造的是工农兵英雄形象，宣传的是毛泽东思想。我不但从心眼里感到高兴，而且感到很光荣。
    革命京剧样板戏和我所热爱的革命歌曲，都是歌颂我们伟大的领袖和伟大的党，都是宣传毛泽东思想。热爱工农兵，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的强烈感情，使我对革命京剧现代戏有了深厚的感情。革命样板戏鼓舞着我，英雄人物李玉和的形象鼓舞着我，我决心好好学习，一定要把李玉和演好。在学习演唱《红灯记》的过程中，我遇到了不少困难：唱腔不熟，节奏掌握不稳，咬字无力。但这些困难没有吓倒我，我一想起江青同志在这场尖锐复杂的两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，披荆斩棘，一往无前的精神，就给我增添了无穷的力量。我决心排除万难，去争取胜利。在分析了《红灯记》这段戏之后，李奶奶、李玉和、铁梅三代英雄人物的思想感情，强烈地激发着我的创作热情。我一定要在这段戏中努力把李玉和那种胸怀无产阶级革命大志，在敌人刑场上临危不惧，对革命无限忠诚的英雄气概表现出来。在这个思想指导下，我日夜苦练，终于在比较短的时间内，上演了这一段戏。虽然我在塑造李玉和这个英雄人物上还很不够，但是每次演出都受到广大工农兵观众的欢迎和鼓励，使我更加增强了信心。
    这次学习和演出革命样板戏，使我受到了深刻的教育，是我在思想上和艺术革命化上的一个新的起点。我认识到只有用毛泽东思想去占领舞台，才能真正彻底地把文艺领域的大权夺到无产阶级手中来。
    现在，我们把文艺领域的大权夺回到无产阶级手里来了，我们还要掌好用好这个权。为宣传毛泽东思想，我们不怕围攻不怕牺牲；为宣传毛泽东思想，我们争分夺秒不怕难。没有作品，就自己动手写。革命需要就是命令。我不但要放声歌唱革命歌曲，我还要为革命而创作歌曲。今年红五月到来之前，我就抓紧时间，为毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中的十二段语录谱了曲。最近，我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的喜讯传来之后，我又立即写出了《欢呼祖国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功》的歌词，歌颂毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。毛主席教导我们说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”我坚决听毛主席的话，永远为工农兵歌唱，永远忠于无产阶级，永远忠于毛泽东思想，用鲜血和生命捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使革命文艺真正成为无产阶级专政的有力工具。
