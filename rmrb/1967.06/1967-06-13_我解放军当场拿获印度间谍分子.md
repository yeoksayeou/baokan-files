The Chinese People's Liberation Army Captures an Indian Spy on the Spot

The Indian reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, have long played the role of anti-China clowns, committing numerous anti-China acts. Engaging in espionage activities in China is part of their evil anti-China activities.

Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: Recently, the second secretary of the Indian Embassy in China, Lu Guan Nan, sneaked into a military restricted area in the western suburbs of Beijing, conducting reconnaissance and taking photographs of the restricted area, engaging in espionage activities. He was captured on the spot by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This proves that Lu Guan Nan is completely an espionage agent disguised as a diplomat, a lackey serving imperialism and reactionaries. The fact that the Indian spy Lu Guan Nan was captured again demonstrates that all those who dare to engage in espionage activities in China will not escape the grasp of the Chinese people who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the afternoon of June 4th, the Indian spy Lu Guan Nan from the Indian Embassy in China and the third secretary Vijay blatantly disregarded Chinese laws and conducted reconnaissance and took photographs of a military restricted area in the western suburbs of Beijing. The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, who were vigilantly guarding the restricted area, discovered Lu Guan Nan and Vijay's criminal activities. After failing to stop them, they detained them and handed them over to the public security authorities for questioning. During the questioning, Lu Guan Nan and Vijay had a bad attitude and tried to evade responsibility. Only after being sternly refuted by the public security personnel did they reluctantly hand over the film. After developing the film on the spot, it was found that the more than ten photographs they took clearly formed a complete topographical map of the restricted area and its surrounding area. With the evidence in hand, Lu Guan Nan and Vijay had nothing to say and had to lower their heads, meekly signing the interrogation record.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved one victory after another, producing a profound impact worldwide. Revolutionary people around the world are all jubilant. However, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are terrified. They maliciously slander and attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attempting to defame its influence worldwide. The Indian reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, have long played the role of anti-China clowns, committing numerous anti-China acts. Engaging in espionage activities is part of the Indian reactionaries' evil anti-China activities. Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, Lu Guan Nan has taken advantage of the situation, acting recklessly, blatantly violating Chinese laws, and collecting Chinese political and military intelligence everywhere for the benefit of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, committing serious crimes against the Chinese people.

The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have become more vigilant against domestic and foreign class enemies through the great tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their eyes have become even clearer. The Indian spy Lu Guan Nan from the Indian Embassy in China has conducted illegal intelligence-gathering activities on Chinese territory and has been repeatedly driven away or captured on the spot by the revolutionary masses of our country. The spy Lu Guan Nan is shameless to the extreme. In order to cover up his identity, he has disguised himself and impersonated personnel from friendly countries such as Pakistan and Nepal stationed in China, or students, and has sneaked into high-level party and government organs in China, mixed into the reception station of the Central Cultural Revolution Group of the Communist Party of China, and stolen intelligence. He has been caught by the Red Guards many times or driven away by the revolutionary masses or handed over to the public security authorities to admit his mistakes. However, Lu Guan Nan not only did not stop, but became even more brazen, stealing intelligence related to military restricted areas, and was finally captured on the spot, falling into the net of Chinese law.

### 我解放军当场拿获印度间谍分子

    一切在中国从事间谍活动的牛鬼蛇神决逃不出中国人民的巨掌
    我解放军当场拿获印度间谍分子
    印度反动派长期以来配合美帝和苏修充当反华小丑，干了许多反华的勾当。在中国从事间谍活动，是它从事反华罪恶活动的一部分。
    新华社十二日讯　印度驻华大使馆二等秘书鲁冠南最近窜至北京西郊某地，对我军事禁区进行窥测和偷摄禁区照片，从事间谍活动，被我人民解放军当场拿获。事实证明，鲁冠南完完全全是一个披着外交官外衣的间谍分子，是为帝国主义和反动派服务的奴才。印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南被拿获这一事实再次说明：一切胆敢在中国从事间谍活动的牛鬼蛇神，决逃不出正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民的巨掌。
    六月四日下午，印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南和印度驻华大使馆三等秘书维杰竟然置中国法令于不顾，在北京西郊某地对我军事禁区进行窥测和偷摄照片。百倍警惕地在该禁区警卫的中国人民解放军战士发现了鲁冠南和维杰的犯罪行径，在阻止无效的情况下，遂将他们扣留，交公安部门查问。在查问过程中，鲁冠南和维杰态度恶劣，百般狡赖，在我公安人员严正驳斥下，他们才被迫交出胶卷。经过当场冲洗，发现他们所拍的十余张照片清楚地构成该禁区及其附近区域的完整地形图。人赃俱在，鲁冠南和维杰无言以对，不得不低下头来，乖乖地在查问记录上签了字。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，取得一个又一个的胜利，在全世界产生了极为广泛深刻的影响，世界革命人民无不为之欢欣鼓舞。而帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派却害怕得要死，他们丧心病狂地诬蔑、攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，企图诋毁它在全世界的影响。印度反动派长期以来配合美帝和苏修，充当反华小丑，干了许多反华的勾当。从事间谍活动就是印度反动派从事反华罪恶活动的一部分。自从我国开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，鲁冠南竟认为有机可乘，四出活动，肆无忌惮地违犯中国法令，到处搜集中国政治、军事情报，为美帝和苏修效劳，对中国人民犯下了严重的罪行。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，经过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，对国内外阶级敌人的革命警惕性更高了，眼睛更加明亮了。印度驻华大使馆间谍分子鲁冠南在中国领土上进行非法的窃取情报活动，就曾一再被我国革命群众轰走或当场抓住。间谍分子鲁冠南无耻之极，他为了掩盖其身份，曾乔装打扮，冒充巴基斯坦和尼泊尔等友好国家驻华使馆人员或留学生，多次潜入中国高级党政机关，混入中共中央文化革命小组接待站等地，窃取情报，曾经多次被红卫兵抓住，或者被革命群众赶走，或者被扭送公安部门，承认错误。但是，鲁冠南不但没有收敛，反而变本加厉，竟然窃取有关军事禁区的情报，终被当场拿获，落入中国人民的法网。
