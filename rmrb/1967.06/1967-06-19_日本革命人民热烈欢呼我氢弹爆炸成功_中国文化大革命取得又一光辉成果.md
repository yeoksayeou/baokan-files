Japanese revolutionary people warmly celebrate the success of our hydrogen bomb explosion, marking another glorious achievement of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, the East Asia News Agency reported that the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb has greatly encouraged the Japanese revolutionary people. They enthusiastically celebrate another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The leader of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party, Anoki Takayoshi, said: The success of China's "hydrogen bomb explosion" is a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary forces centered around American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and a great encouragement to the revolutionary forces around the world who are engaged in a life-and-death struggle.

Anoki said: "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, China's development of nuclear weapons has entered a new stage. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a glorious achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This news thoroughly shatters the farce of the United Nations, where the U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding to attempt to rule the world. The Japanese revolutionary people will definitely persist in their struggle against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists until they are thoroughly defeated."

A worker from Tachikawa City, Usami Seiji, said, "When the U.S. and the Soviet Union are tightening their collusion to betray the interests of the people of the world, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists are following the Soviet revisionists and sliding further and further away from the Marxist-Leninist path, the success of China's hydrogen bomb explosion is a powerful support and encouragement for the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle."

A farmer from Suzaka City, Nagano Prefecture, Miyama Manichiro, said, "This time, China's successful hydrogen bomb explosion is a powerful blow to all forces both inside and outside China that oppose China. At the same time, it is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of Japan and the world."

The chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Nakajima Takeshige, said: "Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1958: 'To make a few atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is completely possible in ten years.' This successful hydrogen bomb test fully proves Chairman Mao's wise foresight. I am deeply moved. What China says, it always does. China has declared, 'Under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons.' This is completely reliable."

The secretary-general of the Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, Itabayashi Shozo, said: "At a time when the people of Vietnam, the Arab people, and revolutionary people around the world are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, China's nuclear weapons have developed even faster. This successful hydrogen bomb explosion is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world. This is another glorious victory of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

Itabayashi said: "The revolutionary people of Japan will closely unite with the people of China, Vietnam, the Arab world, and the people of the world, and fight more vigorously and bravely in the revolutionary struggle."

    日本革命人民热烈欢呼我氢弹爆炸成功
    中国文化大革命取得又一光辉成果
    据新华社十八日讯  据东方通讯社报道，中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功给日本革命人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。他们热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）的领导人穴迫隆之说：中国“氢弹爆炸成功”是对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义为中心的反革命势力沉重的打击，是对正在进行生死搏斗的全世界革命势力巨大的鼓舞。
    穴迫说：“在毛泽东思想的指导下，中国核武器的发展进入了一个新阶段。这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一光辉成果。这个消息，彻底粉碎了美、苏狼狈为奸正在联合国导演的妄图统治世界的丑剧。日本革命人民一定坚持反对美帝国主义、日本反动派和日共修正主义分子的斗争，直到彻底打败他们。”
    立川市的工人宇佐美静治说，当美、苏加紧勾结出卖世界人民的利益，“日共修正主义分子追随苏修，在背叛马克思列宁主义道路上越滑越远的时候，中国氢弹爆炸成功，这是对日本人民进行革命斗争强有力的支持和鼓舞。”
    长野县须坂市的农民宫前万一郎说，这次中国的氢弹爆炸成功，是对中国国内外所有反对中国的势力的强有力的打击。同时，是对日本和世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏说：“毛主席早在一九五八年就指出：搞一点原子弹、氢弹，我看有十年功夫完全可能。这次氢弹试验成功完全证实了毛主席的英明预见，对此我非常感动。中国说的话，从来是算数的。中国宣布‘在任何时候、任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。’这是完全可以信赖的。”
    亚非人民团结日本委员会秘书长板井庄作说：“正当越南人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义展开生死搏斗的时候，中国的核武器得到了更迅速的发展。这次成功地爆炸了氢弹，是对全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞。这是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一光辉胜利。”
    板井说：“日本的革命人民将和中国、越南、阿拉伯以及全世界人民紧密团结，更加奋发地、更加勇敢地展开革命斗争。”
