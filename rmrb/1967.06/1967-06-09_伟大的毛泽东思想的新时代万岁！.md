The great document of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, "Notice of May 16, 1966," personally drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong, is a magnificent Marxist-Leninist document. This great historical document creatively develops Marxism-Leninism and solves the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is an extremely important event in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism. After studying this historical document, I have further deeply realized that Marxism-Leninism has entered the stage of Mao Zedong Thought today.

In this "Notice," Comrade Mao Zedong points out: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these characters have been exposed by us, some have not yet been exposed, and some are still being trusted by us and are being cultivated as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of Party committees must pay full attention to this."

Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us that the main target of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The contradiction between them and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are the main force of this revolution. The resolution of this contradiction requires mobilizing the masses to expose the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize their crimes, and seize power from below.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat has been completely proven correct through the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. As Comrade Mao Zedong predicted, the "Khrushchev-like characters" who were sleeping by our side, the biggest power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have been exposed.

This great victory is a major blow to imperialism and modern revisionism, who attempt to change the great base of world revolution—China—through their agents. Exposing China's Khrushchev is also a major contribution to the world revolution.

Since Khrushchev changed the color of the first socialist state in the world— the Soviet Union—achieving the restoration of capitalism, the question of how to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism has been posed before all Marxist-Leninists in the world. Comrade Mao Zedong fully paid attention to the entire historical experience of the Soviet Union, comprehensively summarized the historical experience of the international communist movement and the dictatorship of the proletariat, personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and thus solved this major problem both in theory and practice. The Great October Revolution opened the road for the proletariat to seize political power, while Comrade Mao Zedong opened the road for the proletariat to seize political power, prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and gradually advance from socialism to communism after seizing political power. This is a great milestone in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism.

The essence of Marxism-Leninism is the theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Comrade Mao Zedong solved the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, raising the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat to a new stage. This is as great a contribution to Marxism-Leninism as Lenin's solution to the theoretical and practical problem of achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country. It is the best proof that Marxism-Leninism has entered the era of Mao Zedong Thought.

Marxism-Leninism has developed through three stages. Marxism developed into Leninism in the era of imperialism and the initial victory of the proletarian revolution. Today, in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory, it has developed into Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage.

Today, any people's revolution in any country cannot achieve genuine victory without Mao Zedong Thought. Just as opposing Leninism is fundamentally opposing Marxism when Marxism entered the stage of Leninism, opposing Mao Zedong Thought today is opposing Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone for true Marxist-Leninists or revisionists.

Just like all reactionaries in the world, the revisionists of the Japanese Communist Party are frantically attacking Mao Zedong Thought. They fabricate groundless rumors, claiming that "Mao Zedong Thought is not applicable to highly developed capitalist countries," denying that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere. However, more and more people around the world are believing in and seriously studying Mao Zedong Thought, and it has deeply entered the hearts of revolutionary people like water seeping into sand. This is an inevitable trend of historical development that no one can stop. In contrast, the revisionists will inevitably be spat upon by the revolutionary people and thrown into the garbage heap of history.

After the great division and reorganization of the international communist movement, it will undoubtedly achieve greater and more magnificent development on the basis of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary people of the whole world will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without the system of exploitation.

    伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代万岁！
    日本　横川伸
    毛泽东同志亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义文件。这个伟大的历史文件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题。这是马克思列宁主义发展史上极其重要的大事。我学习了这个历史文件后，进一步深刻地认识到马克思列宁主义今天已进入毛泽东思想的阶段。
    毛泽东同志在这个《通知》中指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    毛泽东同志教导我们，无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们同广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子是这个革命的主力。这个矛盾的解决要靠放手发动群众，揭露党内走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判他们的罪行，并对他们采取自下而上的夺权斗争。
    毛泽东同志的无产阶级专政下革命的理论，通过一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，完全证明了它的正确性。正如毛泽东同志所预言的，睡在我们身旁的“赫鲁晓夫那样的人物”、党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了。
    这个重大胜利是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的最大的打击，他们妄图通过其代理人使世界革命的强大基地——中国变质。把中国的赫鲁晓夫揪出来，也是对世界革命的重大贡献。
    自从赫鲁晓夫把世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联改变了颜色，实现了资本主义复辟以后，在全世界马列主义者面前，提出了如何巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的问题。毛泽东同志充分地注意了整个苏联的历史经验，全面地总结了国际共产主义运动和无产阶级专政的历史经验，亲自发动和领导了史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，从而在理论上和实践上解决了这样重大的问题。伟大的十月革命开辟了无产阶级夺取政权的道路，而毛泽东同志开辟了无产阶级夺取政权之后，防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政，由社会主义逐步走向共产主义的道路。这是马克思列宁主义发展史上伟大的里程碑。
    马克思列宁主义的精华是关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。毛泽东同志解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题，把马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的理论提高到一个崭新的阶段。这和列宁曾经解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题一样，是对马克思列宁主义的伟大贡献，是马克思列宁主义已进入毛泽东思想的时代的最好证明。
    马克思列宁主义是经过三个阶段发展的。马克思主义在帝国主义和无产阶级革命取得初步胜利的时代发展到列宁主义。而在今天，即帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代发展到毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到崭新的阶段。
    今天，任何国家人民的革命，离开了毛泽东思想就不可能取得真正的胜利。正如马克思主义进入列宁主义的阶段，反对列宁主义就是从根本上反对马克思主义，今天反对毛泽东思想就是反对马克思列宁主义。因此，对待毛泽东思想的态度是真马克思列宁主义者或修正主义者的试金石。
    如同世界上的一切反动派一样，日共修正主义分子正在疯狂地攻击毛泽东思想。他们制造毫无根据的谣言，胡说什么“毛泽东思想不适用高度发达的资本主义国家”，否定毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。但是，全世界信仰和认真学习毛泽东思想的人越来越多，象砂地吸水一样，毛泽东思想已深入革命人民的心坎。这是任何人都无法阻挡的历史发展的必然趋势。与此相对抗的修正主义者们，必将被革命人民所唾弃，扔进历史的垃圾堆里。
    国际共产主义运动经过大分化、大改组后，在伟大的毛泽东思想的基础上，无疑地会获得更高的，更伟大的发展。全世界革命人民将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，建立起没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。
