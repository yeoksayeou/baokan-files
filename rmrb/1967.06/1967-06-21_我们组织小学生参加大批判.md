Currently, revolutionary teachers and students in primary and secondary schools, following the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao's "resume classes and make revolution," are studying while making revolution. They firmly grasp the line of struggle between the two lines, conducting a great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, achieving revolutionary great unity with revolutionary cadres as the core and teaching classes as the foundation, and establishing "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs. This has led to a high tide of resuming classes and making revolution.

However, some schools have encountered many obstacles in resuming classes and making revolution. The main obstacle is that the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been eliminated, and the estrangement and opposition among revolutionary teachers and students have not been eliminated. Many facts have proven that to eliminate these obstacles, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to achieve revolutionary great unity in the great criticism. Achieving revolutionary great unity is a necessary condition for deepening the great criticism, doing a good job in resuming classes and making revolution, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

We Organize Primary School Students to Participate in the Great Criticism

We resumed classes and made revolution on February 20 this year. Should primary school students participate in the criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road? Initially, we thought that students were young and did not understand much, so they could not play a significant role. If not handled properly, it might affect teachers from participating in the great criticism. At that time, although we occasionally allowed students to participate in some criticism activities, we did not truly organize students into the revolutionary great criticism. We studied Chairman Mao's works and the Party Central Committee's notice on the primary school proletarian cultural revolution with this question in mind. We realized that resuming classes and making revolution is to resume the class of Mao Zedong Thought and the class of class struggle. We must let students participate in the revolutionary great criticism. Through the great criticism, students can study, understand, and apply Chairman Mao's works, understand the principles of class struggle, and recognize the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and attempting to restore capitalism. If we do not let students participate in the great criticism, we will deviate from the current greatest politics, and the proletarian cultural revolution in schools will be in vain.

After clarifying our understanding, we proceeded with the revolutionary great criticism according to the characteristics of primary school students. Before the great criticism, our school had fewer students attending. Students from grades one to five came to school in the morning, attended two classes, had half an hour of physical education, and participated in some activities criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. Graduating students came to school even less frequently. After our persuasion and education, now all students (including graduating students) come to school in the morning and have added three afternoons. The activities include studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," learning current events, participating in labor, learning arithmetic and other cultural and scientific knowledge, and having some time to participate in various revolutionary activities.

In the revolutionary great criticism, we extensively exposed the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and distributed criticism articles from workers, peasants, and soldiers to students for study. Based on the initial mobilization of all teachers and students, we organized a school-wide denunciation meeting, followed by a short-distance parade (including grades one and two). Through these activities, students initially recognized the ugly face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and understood why they should raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the revolutionary great criticism movement.

We also organized students to participate in "remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness" activities according to the characteristics of young children, making them understand the painful and miserable lives of laboring people in the old society and how landlords and capitalists exploited laboring people. We also organized students to publish the Little Red Guards' wall newspaper, with students from various grades drawing many cartoons and writing many criticism articles and children's songs. Students used blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, cartoon exhibitions, children's song special editions, and artistic performances to express their boundless love for Chairman Mao and to expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

### 我们组织小学生参加大批判

    目前，中小学的广大革命师生，遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席“复课闹革命”的教导，一边上课，一边闹革命。他们紧紧抓住两条路线斗争这条纲，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判、大斗争，实现了以革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的革命的大联合，成立了“三结合”的临时权力机构，从而掀起了复课闹革命的高潮。
    但是，有些学校复课闹革命遇到不少阻力。这种阻力，主要是资产阶级反动路线的流毒没有肃清，革命师生之间、学生之间的隔阂和对立尚未消除。许多事实证明，要消除这种阻力，必须彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并在大批判中实现革命的大联合。而实现革命的大联合，又是深入进行大批判，搞好复课闹革命，进行斗批改的必要条件。中小学无产阶级革命派，一定要牢牢掌握这个斗争大方向。　——编　者
    我们组织小学生参加大批判
    我们是在今年二月二十日复课闹革命的。小学复课闹革命，学生要不要参加批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派？开始时，我们认为学生年龄小，不懂事，起不了什么作用，搞不好反而影响教师投入大批判。当时，我们虽然偶尔吸收学生参加一些批判活动，但没有真正把学生组织到革命的大批判中去。我们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作和党中央关于小学无产阶级文化大革命的通知，认识到复课闹革命，就是复毛泽东思想之课，复阶级斗争之课，必须让学生参加革命的大批判。通过大批判，使学生活学活用毛主席著作，懂得阶级斗争的道理，认清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的罪恶。如果不让学生参加大批判，就脱离了当前最大的政治，要搞好学校的无产阶级文化大革命也就落空了。
    认识搞清楚了，我们就根据小学生的特点来进行革命的大批判。我们学校在大批判以前，学生到校的时间是比较少的。一到五年级每天上午来校，上两节课，搞半小时的体育活动，参加一些批判资产阶级反动路线的活动。毕业班同学来校时间则更少。经过我们的说服教育，现在所有的学生（包括毕业班），除每天上午来校外，还增加了三个下午的时间。活动的内容是，结合文化大革命形势学习《毛主席语录》，学习时事，参加劳动，学习算术等文化科学知识，还有一定的时间参加各种革命活动。
    在革命的大批判中，我们大讲党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，并把工农兵的批判文章印发给学生，组织学生学习。在全校师生初步发动的基础上，我们组织了全校规模的声讨大会，会后又组织了短距离的游行（包括一、二年级）。通过这些活动，使学生初步认识了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶面目，懂得为什么要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开展革命大批判运动的道理。
    我们又根据少年儿童的特点，组织学生开展忆苦思甜活动，使学生了解旧社会劳动人民的痛苦、悲惨的生活，懂得地主、资本家是怎么剥削劳动人民的。我们还组织学生办红小兵墙报，各年级学生画了许多漫画，写了不少批判文章和儿歌。学生用黑板报、墙报、漫画展览、儿歌特刊、文艺演出等形式，抒发了对毛主席的无限热爱，揭露和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶。
