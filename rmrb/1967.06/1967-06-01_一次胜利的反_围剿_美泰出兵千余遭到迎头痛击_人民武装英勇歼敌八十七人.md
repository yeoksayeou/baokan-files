A Victory in Countering "Encirclement and Suppression"

U.S. and Thai Forces of Over a Thousand Suffer Heavy Blows
People's Armed Forces Brave Combat, Kill 87 Enemies

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Bangkok: The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently published a dispatch reporting the glorious victory achieved by the people's armed forces in Lang Hin San Village, Nakhon Phanom Province, in a recent battle against "encirclement and suppression." They killed and wounded 87 American aggressors and Thai reactionary military and police.

Nakhon Phanom Province has a large U.S. air base. The people's armed forces in Lang Hin San Village are like a sharp dagger threatening the U.S.-Thai reactionaries, making them anxious and restless. They have tried every means to eliminate this armed force.

American officers personally commanded and participated in this "encirclement and suppression," deploying two regiments totaling over a thousand troops, fully equipped with light and heavy weapons, helicopters, and artillery, intending to uproot this dagger. The cunning enemy, riding in armored vehicles loaded with soldiers and police, surrounded Lang Hin San Village. Despite the enemy's overwhelming superiority and the people's armed forces' inferiority, the brave and clever fighters of the people's armed forces fiercely counterattacked. During the battle, the people's armed forces bravely threw back the grenades thrown at them, striking the enemy with terror. When the enemy's commanding officer led the charge, he was blown up by a grenade thrown by a fighter from the people's armed forces, causing the military and police of the Thanom Kittikachorn clique to be too frightened to advance. The vicious enemy also tried to bombard and strafe with helicopters, but these tactics also failed. One helicopter was damaged by rifle fire from the people's armed forces, and the pilot's leg was broken.

Thus, until evening, the enemy used aircraft to drop flares and then bombarded Lang Hin San Village. The fighters of the people's armed forces took the enemy by surprise, attacking the enemy's command post from the rear, successfully destroying it, and causing the enemy to panic and lose control. At this moment, the people's armed forces broke through and escaped. When the two enemy units attacked Lang Hin San Village, they mistakenly identified each other as the people's armed forces, resulting in a chaotic battle with heavy casualties.

The 21-hour battle ended in victory. The people's armed forces in Lang Hin San Village dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries, annihilating 87 enemies, killing 42, and wounding 45. Two American officers were killed, and two Thai reactionary military officers at the rank of colonel or higher were killed or wounded.

    一次胜利的反“围剿”
    美泰出兵千余遭到迎头痛击
    人民武装英勇歼敌八十七人
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台最近发表一篇通讯，报道了那空拍侬府廊希南村人民武装在不久前一次反“围剿”战斗中所取得的辉煌胜利，打死打伤美国侵略者和泰国反动军警共八十七人。
    那空拍侬府有庞大的美国空军基地，廊希南村的人民武装象一把尖刀一样威胁着那空拍侬府的美泰反动派，使它们惊慌不安，它们千方百计地想把这支人民武装消灭掉。
    美国军官亲自指挥并直接参加了这次“围剿”，共出动了两个团一千多人并配备了全副轻重武器、直升飞机、大炮等，妄想把这把尖刀拔掉。狡猾的敌人开着装甲车满载军队和警察包围了廊希南村，在敌人占绝对优势而人民武装占劣势的情况下，英勇、机智的人民武装战士，狠狠地反击敌人，在与敌人交锋作战时，人民武装勇敢地把扔过来的手榴弹迅速地抛回去，打得敌人丧魂落魄。敌人的连指挥员带领冲锋时，被人民武装战士当场用手榴弹炸死，他侬集团的军警惊吓得都不敢继续前进了。凶恶的敌人又用炮轰和直升飞机俯冲扫射的办法，也都没有能够得逞，有一架直升飞机也被人民武装用步枪打坏了，驾驶员的腿也被打断了。
    就这样直到傍晚，敌人用飞机投照明弹，然后炮轰廊希南村。人民武装的战士出其不意地绕到敌人背后，对敌人的指挥部进行了袭击，成功地炸毁了这个指挥部，敌人慌作一团，乱了手脚。就在这个时候，人民武装全部胜利地突围了出去。敌人的两支部队进攻廊希南村时，互相误认对方为人民武装，混战一场，死伤累累。
    持续了二十一小时的战斗胜利结束了，廊希南村的人民武装给予了美泰反动派以沉重的打击，一举歼灭了敌人八十七人，打死四十二人，打伤四十五人，美国军官两人被打死，泰国反动派校级军官死伤两人。
