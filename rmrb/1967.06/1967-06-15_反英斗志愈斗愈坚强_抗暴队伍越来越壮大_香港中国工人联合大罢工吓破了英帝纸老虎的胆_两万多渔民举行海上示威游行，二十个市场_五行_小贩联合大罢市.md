The united strike by Chinese workers in Hong Kong, which began on June 10, has entered its fourth day with great momentum. The workers are full of spirit and determination, bravely and resolutely smashing the shameless threats and bribes of the Hong Kong British authorities and the employers, driving them into a state of utter disarray.

On June 10, workers, farmers, and fishermen in the New Territories, including Shek O, held rallies to strongly protest the British imperialists' bloody suppression of Hong Kong compatriots.

Postal workers broke through the tight control of the Hong Kong British authorities and joined the united strike, causing numerous parcels to be undelivered, a large number of letters to be undistributed, and piles of mail to accumulate in the warehouses, greatly diminishing the arrogance of British imperialism.

The strike by more than a thousand workers at the dairy company has left Hong Kong British officials, police, and the invading American troops in Vietnam without meat to eat or milk to drink. The refrigerators are filled with rotting meat.

The workers of the Hong Kong Chinese Gas Company, who were brutally suppressed by the Hong Kong British fascists on June 8, actively joined the strike. Due to machine failures and no one to repair them, the gas supply has been affected. Especially after the brutal murder of gas worker Lai Sung by the Hong Kong British fascists and their attempt to destroy the evidence was exposed on June 11, the workers were filled with rage and determined to give British imperialism double the punishment.

The Chinese workers in Hong Kong British institutions and British enterprises, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless, unyielding, and untricked. They despise, scorn, and ridicule the "laws" of British imperialism and the brutal fascist police. They are engaged in a fierce struggle with the enemy, breaking through all the tricks the enemy plays, including sending spies to the workers' homes to threaten and coerce them to return to work.

On June 10, compatriots from various circles in the Shek O area of the New Territories, adjacent to Bao'an County, held a grand rally and demonstration to strongly counter the new provocations by the Hong Kong British authorities. That noon, more than 800 compatriots gathered in the square next to the Shek O Federation of Villages to hold a strong protest meeting against the crimes of British imperialism. Relatives of the victims who were beaten and arrested by the Hong Kong British authorities in the San Po Kong massacre in Kowloon made a blood-curdling accusation at the meeting. They angrily shouted, "Blood for blood, life for life!" After the meeting, the crowd carried the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, held up Mao's quotations and red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and carried poles, marching through the streets of Shek O in a grand demonstration. When the 800-strong demonstration army passed by the Hong Kong British "police station" in Shek O, the angry crowd ordered the "police station" to close its doors. The frightened Hong Kong British fascist thugs hurriedly closed the iron gates. The Hong Kong British authorities' "riot control team" watching from afar did not dare to come forward.

While the compatriots in Shek O were holding the rally and demonstration, the soldiers and militiamen of the People's Liberation Army guarding the border of Bao'an County, and the revolutionary masses of Bao'an County, closely watched the movements of the British imperialists. The relatives in the motherland and the Hong Kong compatriots nearby raised their arms together and shouted, "Down with British imperialism! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism!"

On the same day, workers, farmers, fishermen, youth, and students in the Sai Kung area of the New Territories and Cheung Chau also held separate denunciation meetings.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 14: On the fourth day of the united strike by Chinese workers in Hong Kong British institutions and some British enterprises, June 13, more than 20,000 fishermen in the Hong Kong, Kowloon, and New Territories regions held a historic and unprecedented grand sea demonstration. On the same day, "five trades" street vendors from 20 large and small markets in Hong Kong also held a united market closure. Together with the main force of the working class, they formed a mighty anti-British and anti-violence army, dealing a heavy blow to the decaying and corrupt Hong Kong British authorities.

In the mighty fleet of fishermen, thousands of five-star red flags dyed the entire Hong Kong waters red. Large banners with slogans such as "Resolutely counter the provocations of British imperialism" were hung high on the fishing boats. The fishermen stood on the bows of their ships, raising their arms and shouting, "Down with British imperialism! Long live the great unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon fishermen! Long live the great unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The Hong Kong British authorities, frightened by the great might of the fishermen, hurriedly sent water police boats to provoke them. However, the fishermen of Hong Kong, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were fearless. They glared and rebuked the Hong Kong British water police, "The Hong Kong British authorities must bear full responsibility for their fascist bloody atrocities!" When the fleet passed by Green Hill, the Hong Kong British police station hurriedly closed its doors in panic.

The fishermen who participated in the demonstration issued a joint statement in the evening of June 13, saying: The anti-British and anti-violence demonstration by Hong Kong fishermen showed the great power of the united Hong Kong fishermen, greatly diminishing the arrogance of British imperialism.

The "five trades" street vendors in Hong Kong, who have long been heavily oppressed by the Hong Kong British authorities, held a united market closure on June 13 to protest the bloody suppression of the Hong Kong British authorities against Hong Kong compatriots. The vendors participating in the closure included those selling pork, beef, fish, fruits and vegetables, and poultry. Market notices issued by the "Hong Kong District Market Five Trades Struggle Committee" were also posted on the same day.

Hong Kong street vendors are constantly oppressed and extorted by the "officials" and police of the Hong Kong British authorities. They are often beaten, arrested, fined, or even have their licenses revoked, with no guarantee of life. They are filled with deep hatred for British imperialism. This time, the united market closure action was very determined. Although the Hong Kong British authorities broadcasted threats to the vendors from early morning to late night the day before the closure, threatening to arrest those who "incited" the closure, on the day of the closure, the Hong Kong British authorities sent a large number of plainclothes spies and armed police to various markets in Hong Kong for surveillance, and blatantly threatened the vendors with "license revocation." However, the broad masses of patriotic vendors were not intimidated. In the markets of Sheung Wan and Central, where the Hong Kong British authorities' police and spies had the strictest surveillance and control, most of the vendors selling pork, beef, carp, miscellaneous fish, and vegetables bravely broke through the various obstacles of the Hong Kong British authorities and courageously participated in the market closure.

    反英斗志愈斗愈坚强　抗暴队伍越来越壮大
    香港中国工人联合大罢工吓破了英帝纸老虎的胆
    两万多渔民举行海上示威游行，二十个市场“五行”小贩联合大罢市
    据新华社香港十三日电　港英机构以及英资企业的中国工人，从十日开始的声势浩大的联合大罢工，已经胜利进入第四天。工人们意气风发，斗志昂扬，坚决勇敢地击破港英当局和资方的无耻恐吓和诱骗，使它们陷入狼狈不堪的境地。
    十日，新界沙头角等地的工人、农民、渔民也举行了集会，愤怒抗议英帝国主义对香港同胞进行血腥镇压的罪行。
    邮务工人粉碎港英当局的严密控制，参加了联合罢工斗争，使无数邮包不能寄出，大批信件无人递送，仓库内邮件堆积如山，大灭了港英帝国主义的威风。
    牛奶公司一千多名工人的罢工，使港英当局的官员、军警，以及那些窜来香港的侵越美军，没有肉吃，没有奶喝。冷藏库里的大批肉类也已开始发臭。
    六月八日遭受港英法西斯血腥镇压的香港中华煤气有限公司的工人积极投入了大罢工的行列。由于机器发生故障没有人修理，煤气的供应已发生问题。特别是港英法西斯暴徒残杀煤气工人黎松并企图毁尸灭迹的暴行在十一日被揭发之后，工人们更是满胸怒火，他们决心给英帝国主义以加倍的惩罚。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的港英机构和英资企业的中国工人不怕吓，不怕压，不受骗，他们仇视、鄙视、蔑视港英的帝国主义“法律”和凶残的法西斯军警，针锋相对地同敌人进行着英勇的斗争。敌人耍的各种花招，其中包括派出特务到工人家里恫吓、胁迫工人复工等等，都被工人一一击破。
    毗邻宝安县的新界沙头角地区的各界同胞，十日举行了声势浩大的誓师大会和示威游行，有力地反击港英的新挑衅。这天中午，八百多名同胞在沙头角联乡会侧广场上举行了强烈抗议英帝国主义罪行的集会。在九龙新蒲岗血案中被港英当局毒打和逮捕的受害者的家属，在会上作了血泪的控诉。他们愤怒地高呼“杀人偿命，血债血偿！”大会结束后，群众抬着伟大领袖毛主席的像，高举毛主席语录牌和红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，拿着扁担，沿着沙头角的大街，浩浩荡荡地举行示威游行。当八百人的示威大军经过港英沙头角“警署”时，愤怒的群众喝令“警署”关门，吓破了胆的港英法西斯暴徒，慌忙乖乖地关上铁门。在远处监视的港英当局“防暴队”也不敢上前一步。
    在沙头角同胞举行誓师大会和示威游行的时候，雄赳赳地守卫在宝安县边界的人民解放军指战员和民兵们以及宝安县的革命群众，密切地注意着港英帝国主义者的一举一动。祖国的亲人和近在咫尺的香港同胞一起振臂高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”
    同一天，新界西贡地区和长洲的工人、农民、渔民、青年和学生也分别举行了声讨大会。
    据新华社香港十四日电　在港英机构中国职工和一些英资企业中国工人举行联合大罢工的第四天——十三日，港九新界地区两万多名渔民举行了历史上前所未有的声势浩大的海上示威游行。香港区大小二十个市场的“五行”小贩，同日也举行联合大罢市。他们和工人阶级主力军一起，组成了浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴大军，给衰朽腐败的港英当局以巨大的冲击。
    在威武雄壮的渔民船队里，数以千计的五星红旗映红了整个香港海面。渔船上高悬写着“坚决还击英帝国主义挑衅”等标语的巨幅横额。渔民们斗志昂扬，站在船头上举起双臂，高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“港九渔民大团结万岁！”“港九同胞大团结万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    港英当局在渔民的巨大声威面前吓破了胆，慌忙派水警轮前往挑衅，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港渔民无所畏惧，他们横目怒斥港英水警：“港英当局要对它的法西斯血腥暴行负起全部责任！”当船队经过青山时，港英当局的警署惊慌地关上大门。
    参加示威游行的渔民十三日晚发表联合声明说：香港渔民反英抗暴大示威，显示了香港渔民团结起来的伟大力量，大灭了英帝国主义的威风。
    长期遭受港英当局沉重压迫的香港“五行”小贩，为抗议港英当局对香港同胞的血腥镇压，十三日在香港区联合大罢市一天。参加罢市的包括经营猪肉、牛肉、鱼类、水果和蔬菜、家禽等行业的小贩。市场上当天还贴出了“香港区街市五行小贩斗委会”发出的罢市通告。
    香港小贩天天受到港英当局的“官员”和警察的压迫和敲榨，他们动辄遭到殴打、拘捕、罚款，甚至被吊销牌照，生活毫无保障。他们充满了对英帝国主义的刻骨仇恨，这次联合罢市行动非常坚决。尽管港英当局在罢市的前一天通过广播电台从早到晚不停地对小贩进行恐吓，并声言要拘捕“煽动”罢市的人。在罢市的当天，港英当局一早就派来大批便衣特务和武装警察到香港区各个市场进行监视，并且明目张胆地以“吊销牌照”来威胁罢市的小贩。但是广大的爱国小贩没有被吓倒。在港英当局警察和特务监视、控制最严的上环和中环市场，大部分经营猪肉、牛肉、塘鱼、杂鱼、蔬菜的小贩都冲破了港英当局的种种阻拦，勇敢地参加了罢市。
