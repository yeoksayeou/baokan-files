Look, the Revisionist Clique of the Soviet Union Kows to the American Empire!

In Moscow, an exhibition is held to promote U.S.-Soviet cooperation and peddle the American "way of life."
The Soviet revisionist leaders, including Kosygin, attend to praise it, while the broad masses of the Soviet people express great indignation.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, a message from Moscow: Just as the Soviet revisionist leadership is intensifying the full-scale restoration of capitalism at home and actively courting foreign monopoly capital to infiltrate the Soviet economy, an "International Exhibition of Food Industry Equipment 1967" was recently held in Moscow. The Soviet revisionist leadership invited American and many other capitalist countries' monopolies to participate in the exhibition, to extensively promote Western "material civilization" and "way of life" in the Soviet Union, and to sell their machinery and equipment.

American capitalists swarm in

The exhibition was held from May 16 to May 29 in Sokolniki Park, one of the largest parks in Moscow. A total of 1,000 companies from 22 countries participated in the exhibition; in addition to the Soviet Union and some Eastern European revisionist leadership organizations, there were also many monopoly enterprises from the United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and other countries.

Eighteen large American companies, encouraged by the Johnson administration's policy of "building bridges" to the Soviet Union, sent 80 "businessmen" to participate in the exhibition. During the exhibition, the United States also sent two "trade missions" to engage in activities to strengthen "U.S.-Soviet cooperation."

Notably, the Soviet revisionist leadership also "invited" Israel, the tool of American imperialism that is aggressing against Syria and other Arab countries, to participate in the exhibition. They even held a special "Israel Day" on May 23. This once again exposed the shameful traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

U.S. and Soviet flags side by side

The Soviet revisionist leadership placed great hopes on this exhibition and showed great concern. During the exhibition, Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others "visited" the exhibition for several hours. Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Novikov, while presiding over the opening ceremony, called this exhibition an "international exhibition on the most important economic sector" and said that this exhibition "is becoming an effective means to expand (Soviet) foreign economic cooperation and scientific and technological cooperation." He particularly hoped that the exhibition would "help solve" the difficult tasks in the Soviet food industry.

In the 21 exhibition halls of the entire exhibition, the Soviet revisionist leadership allocated two halls to the United States. Under the meticulous arrangement of the Soviet leadership, among the 16 Western countries' exhibition halls, only the United States could display the American flag alongside the host country's Soviet flag at the entrance of the exhibition hall. This fully shows how eager the Soviet revisionist leadership is for "U.S.-Soviet cooperation" and how hypocritical their so-called "support for Vietnam" is.

Johnson's inscription spreads poison

It is noted that the layout of the American pavilion is different from the others. Visitors first see a giant portrait of the American imperialist leader Johnson and an inscription personally signed by him. This robber chief, who practices aggression and plunder abroad and cruel oppression and exploitation at home, shamelessly says in the inscription: "You will see how this technology benefits American consumers and what benefits it brings." He also baits the Soviet leadership, saying that "we hope this exhibition will help you better understand the United States and lead to the expansion of commercial relations between our two countries." To vigorously peddle American "material civilization" to the Soviet Union and help the Soviet revisionist leadership carry out the restoration of capitalism, American monopoly capitalists printed a large number of "propaganda materials" and "instructions," which were distributed by some carefully selected and dressed-up "American girls" at the exhibition. Some large posters in the American pavilion use "U.S.-Soviet cooperation" as the propaganda theme.

According to reports, the Soviet revisionist leadership showed great hospitality to the American pavilion. After the opening ceremony of the exhibition, about 600 Soviet officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Novikov, visited the American pavilion, "responding to every operation demonstration with flattery" and highly "appreciating" the design and display of the exhibition hall.

Desperate to earn foreign exchange

The Soviet revisionist leadership actively concluded deals with Western monopoly capitalists at this exhibition, doing everything possible to cater to their tastes. The exhibition's loudspeakers played soft music all day. To facilitate the infiltration of Western big capitalists and businessmen into the Soviet Union, the exhibition set up a "Business Center," "Advertising Service," and "News Center." According to the exhibition's general manager, who disclosed to the press at the closing of the exhibition, "multiple contacts have been made for the sale and purchase of food industry equipment totaling 100 million rubles." To earn foreign exchange, the Soviet revisionist leadership temporarily set up a large foreign exchange store at the exhibition site. This store was not open to ordinary Soviet people, but it welcomed foreign financial giants and their agents with "welcome."

It is noted that the broad masses of the Soviet people are very indignant about the Soviet revisionist leadership's evil deeds of promoting "U.S.-Soviet cooperation." Near the two American exhibition halls, in the empty space next to the U.S. and Soviet flags, there were a considerable number of "instructions" with Johnson's inscription that had been torn and trampled on by people.

### 看，苏修集团拜倒在美帝脚下的奴才相！  莫斯科举办展览会大肆宣扬美苏合作，贩卖美国“生活方式”    苏修头目柯西金等到场吹捧，广大苏联人民表示十分愤慨

    看，苏修集团拜倒在美帝脚下的奴才相！
    莫斯科举办展览会大肆宣扬美苏合作，贩卖美国“生活方式”
    苏修头目柯西金等到场吹捧，广大苏联人民表示十分愤慨
    据新华社讯　莫斯科消息：正当苏修领导集团在国内加紧全面复辟资本主义和积极招揽外国垄断资本对苏联实行经济渗透的时候，最近在莫斯科举办了“一九六七年食品工业装备国际展览会”。苏修领导集团邀请美国及其他许多资本主义国家的垄断企业参加展出，在苏联大肆宣扬西方的“物质文明”和“生活方式”，并推销它们的机器设备。
     美国资本家蜂拥而至
    这个展览会是从五月十六日到五月二十九日，在莫斯科最大的公园之一——索科尔尼基公园举办的。参加展览会的共有二十二个国家的一千家公司；除苏联和一些东欧修正主义领导集团的有关组织外，还有美国、英国、西德、法国、意大利、日本等国的许多垄断企业的代表。
    美国的十八家大公司，在约翰逊政府的向苏联“搭桥”政策的鼓励下，派出了八十名“实业家”参加展览会。在展览会期间，美国还派来两个“贸易使团”进行活动，以加强“美苏合作”。
    引人注目的是，苏修领导集团还“邀请”了正在对叙利亚等阿拉伯国家进行侵略活动的美帝国主义的工具——以色列参加展览会，并且还在五月二十三日专门为它举行了一个“以色列日”。这再一次暴露了苏修领导集团可耻的叛徒嘴脸。
    美苏国旗并列会场
    苏修领导对这个展览会寄予了很大的希望，表现了极大的关心。在展览会举办期间，苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金等曾到场“参观”达几个小时之久。苏联部长会议副主席诺维科夫在主持开幕的时候，把这个展览会称为“有关最重要的经济部门的国际展览会”，并且说这个展览会“正在成为扩大（苏联）对外经济合作和科学技术合作的有效途径之一”。他特别希望展览会将“促进解决”苏修食品工业方面困难重重的“任务”。
    在整个展览会的二十一个展览馆中，苏修领导集团就让美国占用了两个。在苏修领导的精心安排下，十六个西方国家的展览馆中，只有美国能够在展览馆的大门前把美国国旗同东道国苏联的国旗并列在一起。这充分表明，苏修领导集团是多么热中于“苏美合作”，而他们所宣扬的“支援越南”又是多么虚伪。
    约翰逊题词散布毒素
    人们注意到，美国馆的陈设与其它馆不同，来这里参观的人，首先看到的是美帝国主义的头子约翰逊的巨幅画像和由他亲自签名的题词。这个对外实行侵略和掠夺，对内实行残酷压迫和剥削的美国强盗头子在题词中恬不知耻地说：“你们将看到，这个技术如何给美国消费者带来好处，带来什么样的好处”。他还向苏修领导大施诱饵，说什么“我们希望，这个展览会将帮助你们更好地了解美国，并且导致我们两国之间的商业关系的扩大”。为了向苏联大力兜售美国的“物质文明”和推销产品，帮助苏修领导集团推行资本主义复辟，美国垄断资本家印制了大量的“宣传材料”和“说明书”，并且由一些经过精心挑选和装扮的“美国女郎”在展览会上散发。美国展览馆内的一些大幅图片，则以“苏美合作”作为宣传基调。
    据报道，苏修领导集团对美国馆大献殷勤。在展览会举行开幕式以后，苏联部长会议副主席诺维科夫等约六百名苏联官员，前往参观了美国馆，“对每一个操作表演作出反应时都是说恭维话”，并对展览馆的设计、陈列大加“赞赏”。
    捞取外汇不择手段
    苏修领导集团在这个展览会上积极同西方垄断资本家达成交易，千方百计地迎合他们的口胃。展览会的广播器整天播送靡靡之音。为了便利西方国家的大资本家和大商人对苏联实行渗透，展览会设立了“营业中心”、“广告服务处”和“新闻中心”等。据展览会总经理在展览会闭幕时对报界透露，“已就出售和采购总额为一亿卢布的食品工业设备进行了多次联系”。为了捞取外汇，苏修领导集团在展览场地临时设立了一个巨大的外汇商店。这个商店对普通的苏联人不开放，但对持有西方货币的外国金融巨头及其代理人则是“欢迎光临”。
    人们注意到，广大的苏联人民对苏修领导集团大搞“苏美合作”的罪恶行径是非常愤慨的。在美国的两个展览馆的附近，在美苏两国国旗旁边的空地上，就有着相当数量的被人们撕碎和踩脏的印有约翰逊题词的“说明书”。
