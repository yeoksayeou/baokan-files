	“Tigers crouch and dragons coil, today surpassing yesterday, the world is turned upside down, and the sentiment is profound and stirring.”
	June 1, 1966, is a day that will never be forgotten! On this day, the hearts of the revolutionary masses of Peking University were filled with excitement and joy. On this day, our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, personally decided to broadcast the first revolutionary big-character poster of Peking University, and praised it as the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster in the country, and as the Beijing People's Commune Declaration of the 1960s. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

	Chairman Mao's wise decision is a great strategic decision that ignited the blazing flames of the proletarian cultural revolution, sounded the charge against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and organized millions upon millions of a mighty proletarian cultural revolutionary army to launch a fierce attack on the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party! Attack! Attack! Attack! The flames of struggle quickly swept across the entire country, shaking the world.

	Over the past year, the proletarian cultural revolution has shaken the palaces of all the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary devils, shattered the beautiful dream of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to restore capitalism in China, and written the most magnificent chapter in the history of the international communist movement, opening a new era in human history!

	“June 1st” is a glorious day, a great day, a day of victory for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide. On this grand day, we cheer, we sing, and we shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!

	When we look back on the revolutionary fighting journey of the past year, a thousand words and ten thousand words cannot express our boundless loyalty to the great teacher, Chairman Mao. A thousand songs and ten thousand songs cannot express our boundless love for the great leader, Chairman Mao. Dipping into the waters of rivers and seas cannot express our boundless admiration and worship for the great commander and great helmsman, Chairman Mao.

	The vast ocean needs a helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionary masses must seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road by relying on Mao Zedong Thought, hold power firmly by relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and consolidate power by relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the source of all our wisdom and strength.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, precisely to maintain their power.” The old Peking University, with Lü Ping at the helm, and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, under the support and protection of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, colluded with reactionary academic “authorities” to turn Peking University into a stubborn fortress of the bourgeoisie, attempting to turn Peking University into a base for the restoration of capitalism. For a long time, they have been carrying out evil activities against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. Witnessing their evil deeds, how can we not be filled with rage? How can we not rebel against them? How can we not seize power from them? With boundless loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for the class enemy, we raised high the banner of “Revolution is justified, rebellion is justified,” relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and engaged in a long, repeated, and fierce class struggle with Lü Ping and his ilk.

	In 1965, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen, personally manufactured the extremely serious counter-revolutionary incident of the “International Hotel” conference besieging the revolutionary masses for seven months. They used all the vile methods in the counter-revolutionary revisionist “February Outline” to besiege and persecute the revolutionary masses. Facing the enemy's siege, the revolutionary masses fought bravely and smashed the enemy's evil plots, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In those days of white terror, comrades recited countless times the brilliant poem: “Only heroes can drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves,” which brought us endless strength and the confidence of victory.

	Last May 25th, under the great call of Chairman Mao and the great historical document of the May 16th Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China personally drafted and presided over by Chairman Mao, we posted the first big-character poster firing at the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Beijing Municipal Committee and the old Peking University Party Committee. We also relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Without the May 16th Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, without Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and without the great Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no “May 25th” big-character poster. In those days of arduous struggle, Chairman Mao's great teachings: “Dare to suffer a thousand cuts, dare to pull the emperor off his horse,” “Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory,” and “No matter how difficult and painful the situation is, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight” are invincible spiritual atomic bombs, the strongest ideological weapons for us to dare to struggle, dare to rebel, persist in struggle, and strive for victory!

	Chairman Mao's order for the proletarian cultural revolution has sounded the death knell for the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. But the enemy is not willing to die. They struggle desperately to preserve the power they have usurped from the proletariat, concocting a bourgeois reactionary line, stubbornly standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the proletarian cultural revolution, confusing right and wrong, besieging the revolutionary masses, suppressing different opinions, implementing white terror, and thinking they are triumphant, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and crushing the spirit of the proletariat, how poisonous it is! Surrounding the issue of “power,” the proletarian revolutionary masses have conducted a brave and tenacious struggle. “For the sake of sacrifice, many are ambitious, daring to change the sky and the earth,” relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Central Cultural Revolution Group has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses, and in the arduous years of struggle, timely bringing us Chairman Mao's wise instructions and boundless care, leading us to overcome one difficulty after another and achieve one great victory after another.

	Every time at the critical moment of the revolution, Chairman Mao always points out the direction of struggle for us and corrects the direction of the ship. It was Chairman Mao who personally issued the great call for the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pushing the proletarian cultural revolution to a higher stage; it was Chairman Mao who personally sent the great People's Liberation Army of China, strongly supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle for power, smashing the capitalist restoration tide's repeated rampant attacks. Now, the publication of the great historical document of the May 16th Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has pushed the proletarian cultural revolution to a new high tide. Today, the decisive moment for the proletarian revolutionary masses to launch a general offensive against the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road has arrived, and they can no longer escape the fate of being completely annihilated.

	All of this is a struggle centered around power; all the victories achieved by the proletarian revolutionary masses in the struggle are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Power is the fundamental issue of the revolution. Years of struggle practice have made us deeply realize the importance of power. Class struggle is complex and varied, but ultimately it is about the issue of power. We must never forget the issue of power and always remember proletarian dictatorship.

	In the great historical document of the Notice, Chairman Mao points out: “The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship.” How wise Chairman Mao's judgment is! The facts revealed in the proletarian cultural revolution prove that the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, the handful of big and small power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, are precisely to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, implement bourgeois dictatorship, and restore capitalism. The struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration will exist sharply throughout the historical period of proletarian dictatorship. This is a life-and-death class struggle. In the proletariat's great struggle against the bourgeoisie, you either eat it or it eats you; you either destroy it or it destroys you. In the proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionary masses, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, after a year of fighting, exposed the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, dug out the mastermind behind China's restoration of capitalism, and eliminated the greatest hidden danger for the revolution in our country and the world revolution. This is the most glorious achievement of the proletarian cultural revolution.

	However, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: “The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, the restoration of capitalism may be imminent at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country must not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be very careful, never relax vigilance.” At present, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has not ended, and the struggle around the issue of power is still fierce. The proletarian revolutionary masses must maintain high vigilance and never be complacent. We must thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fight them down, fight them to the end, and smash their plots to usurp and subvert the red power. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, only recognizing proletarian dictatorship and not recognizing the struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration is not a true Marxist. We must fully understand the complexity and long-term nature of class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and fully understand the repeated and arduous nature of the struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration. Never because of the great victory, lose vigilance.

	The past year, in the history of mankind, is only a fleeting moment, but this year at Peking University is truly “the world is turned upside down, and the sentiment is profound and stirring”! Over the past year, we have deeply felt that seizing power is difficult, holding power firmly is difficult, and consolidating power is even more difficult. The proletarian revolutionary masses must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings: implement the great alliance of the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary “three-in-one combination”; never separate from labor, never separate from the masses; unite with all those who can be united; implement what Marx said, only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself; carry out the struggle between the two classes and the two lines to the end. Only in this way can we effectively defend, consolidate, and develop the red power and ensure that the proletariat's iron-clad mountains and rivers will never change color.

	“It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage, and not to seek fame by learning from Xiang Yu.” At the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching. “Awaken thousands and millions of workers and peasants, unite and fight,” firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, overthrow, smash, and expose the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road; combine the great criticism and great struggle of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our school. We must definitely use power well, hold power firmly, and defend the red power with struggle; we must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever carry forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever follow Chairman Mao in the great waves of class struggle! Advance! Advance!

    大海航行靠舵手

    “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”
    一九六六年六月一日，是多么令人难忘的一天！这一天，我们北京大学无产阶级革命派的心情是何等的激动、何等的兴奋啊！这一天我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席亲自决定广播北京大学第一张革命的大字报，并赞扬它是全国第一张马列主义的大字报，是二十世纪六十年代的北京人民公社宣言。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    毛主席的英明决定，是伟大的战略决策，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，吹响了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的进军号，组织起千千万万浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，向党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子猛烈开火！开火！开火！斗争的烈火迅速席卷全中国，震撼全世界。
    一年来，无产阶级文化大革命震撼着帝、修、反一切魔鬼的宫殿，粉碎了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在中国复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，在国际共产主义运动史上谱写了最壮丽的篇章，开创了人类历史的新纪元！
    “六·一”，这是全国无产阶级革命派的光辉的节日，伟大的节日，胜利的节日，在这盛大的节日里，我们欢呼，我们歌唱，我们一千次一万次高呼：我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    当我们回顾一年来革命战斗历程的时候，千言万语倾诉不尽我们对伟大导师毛主席的无限忠诚，千歌万曲表达不完我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，蘸尽江河大海水写不尽我们对伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的无限敬仰和无限崇拜。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权要靠毛泽东思想，掌好权要靠毛泽东思想，巩固政权同样要靠毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们一切智慧和力量的源泉。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”旧北京大学以陆平为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持、庇护下，勾结反动学术“权威”，把北大搞成一个资产阶级的反动的顽固堡垒，妄图把北大变成复辟资本主义的一个基地。长期以来，他们疯狂进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。目睹他们的罪恶活动，我们怎能不满腔怒火？怎能不造他们的反？怎能不夺他们的权？我们怀着对党对毛主席的无限忠诚，对阶级敌人的无比憎恨，高举“革命无罪，造反有理”的大旗，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，和陆平们展开了长期的、反复的、激烈的阶级斗争。
    一九六五年，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和反革命修正主义分子彭真，一手制造了“国际饭店”会议围攻革命派七个月之久的极端严重的反革命事件。他们对革命派的围攻和迫害，用尽了反革命修正主义《二月提纲》中种种卑劣的手段。面对着敌人的围攻，革命派针锋相对英勇战斗，粉碎了敌人的罪恶阴谋，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在那白色恐怖的日子里，同志们多少次、多少遍诵读：“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴”的光辉诗篇，给我们带来了无穷无尽的力量和必胜的信心。
    去年五月二十五日，在毛主席的伟大号召下，在毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央五月十六日《通知》这一伟大历史文件的鼓舞和引导下，我们贴出了第一张向旧北京市委和旧北大党委一小撮反革命修正主义分子开火的大字报，靠的也是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。没有中共中央五月十六日的《通知》，没有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，没有伟大的毛泽东思想，便没有“五·二五”的大字报。在那艰苦斗争的日子里，毛主席的“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”的伟大教导，是威力无穷的精神原子弹，是我们敢于斗争，敢于造反，坚持斗争，去争取胜利的最强大的思想武器！
    毛主席发出的无产阶级文化大革命的进军令，敲响了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟。但敌人是不甘心死亡的，他们为了保住从无产阶级手中篡夺的权，疯狂地进行垂死挣扎，炮制了一条资产阶级反动路线，顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！围绕着“权”的问题，无产阶级革命派进行了英勇顽强的斗争，“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”，靠的仍然是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。中央文化革命小组，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地支持无产阶级革命派，在艰苦斗争的岁月里，及时地给我们带来了毛主席的英明指示和无限关怀，率领着我们战胜了一个又一个艰难险阻，夺得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    每当革命的关键时刻，毛主席总是给我们指明斗争的道路，拨正航船的方向。是毛主席亲自发出了无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命推向更高的阶段；是毛主席亲自派来了伟大的中国人民解放军，有力地支持了无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，粉碎了资本主义复辟逆流一次次的猖狂进攻。现在，中共中央五月十六日《通知》这一伟大历史文件的公开发表，又把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的高潮。今天，无产阶级革命派向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的决战时刻到来了，他们再也逃不脱被彻底消灭的命运。
    这一切的一切，都是围绕着政权展开的斗争；在斗争中无产阶级革命派所取得的一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    政权，是革命的根本问题。多年来的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到政权的重要意义。阶级斗争千条万绪纷繁复杂，归根到底就是政权问题。我们要永远不忘政权问题，念念不忘无产阶级专政。
    毛主席在《通知》这一伟大历史文件中指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”毛主席的这一论断是何等英明啊！在无产阶级文化大革命中揭露出来的事实证明，混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是要推翻无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，在整个无产阶级专政的历史时期都尖锐的存在着，这是你死我活的阶级大搏斗。在无产阶级对资产阶级的大搏斗中，你不吃掉它，它就吃掉你；你不消灭它，它就消灭你。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，经过一年的奋战，揪出了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，挖出了中国复辟资本主义的总后台，为我国革命和世界革命消除了最大的隐患，这是无产阶级文化大革命最辉煌的战果。
    然而，我们必须牢记毛主席的教导：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”当前，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争没有结束，围绕着政权问题的斗争仍在激烈进行。无产阶级革命派必须保持高度的警惕，千万不可掉以轻心。我们要彻底揭露批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们斗倒，斗臭，粉碎他们妄图窃取和颠覆红色政权的阴谋。在无产阶级专政条件下，只承认无产阶级专政，不承认资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，就不是一个真正的马克思主义者。我们必须充分认识无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争的复杂性和长期性，必须充分认识资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的反复性和艰巨性。千万不要因为取得了伟大胜利，而丧失警惕性。
    过去的一年，在人类历史上只不过是短暂的一瞬，但是北大这一年真是“天翻地覆慨而慷”啊！一年来，我们深深感到，夺取政权难，掌好政权也难，巩固政权更难。无产阶级革命派只有按毛主席的教导办事：实行革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”；永远不脱离劳动，不脱离群众；注意团结一切可以团结的人们；实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己；把两个阶级、两条路线的斗争进行到底。这才能有效地保卫、巩固和发展红色政权，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我们必须牢牢记住毛主席这一伟大教导。“唤起工农千百万，同心干”，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭；把革命的大批判大斗争和我校的斗批改结合起来。我们一定要用好权、掌好权，用战斗保卫红色政权；我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远跟着毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进！前进！　（新华社）
