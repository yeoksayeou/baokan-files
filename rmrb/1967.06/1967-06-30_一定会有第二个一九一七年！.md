There are frequent reports in the press of the Soviet revisionist clique: the Soviet Union imports all kinds of food and clothing from abroad, and the list is endless.

Some of our comrades who have been to the Soviet Union have indeed seen with their own eyes: in today's Soviet Union, various kinds of vegetables, fruits, grains, clothing, leather shoes, daily necessities, and so on are imported. As for vegetables, in Moscow, even ordinary vegetables like cucumbers, green onions, cabbage, potatoes, and tomatoes that are available year-round in our country are rarely seen; as for fruits, they are even scarcer. In stores with signs reading "Fruits and Vegetables," we often see: garlic from the United Arab Republic, green beans and peppers from Bulgaria, apples from North Korea, tomatoes and grapes from Eastern European countries, and cabbage from some other country, and so on. Moreover, the prices are exorbitant.

The great October Revolution has been fifty years since its inception. The Soviet people, under the leadership of Lenin and then Stalin, fought bravely against domestic and foreign class enemies, creating a powerful industry, agriculture, national defense, and science through their hard work. They transformed backward tsarist Russia into a powerful socialist country. People cannot help but ask: why is it that even the daily necessities of life such as vegetables, fruits, and daily necessities have to be imported from abroad today?

The vast and fertile Soviet Union is now so short of grain, vegetables, and fruits. This is certainly not an isolated or accidental phenomenon. This is the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionist clique's usurpation of the party and the government, their implementation of a revisionist political line, and their extensive sabotage of the socialist collective economy in agriculture, leading to a comprehensive capitalist restoration.

The Soviet revisionist clique has abandoned the Leninist principle that "politics must take precedence over economics," betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and eliminated proletarian politics. They advocate profit-seeking in industry and agriculture, vigorously promoting a so-called "new system" centered on material incentives, destroying the collective economic foundation, and advocating personal interests. As a result, bourgeois ideology has spread widely, and capitalist forces have become rampant, turning the original socialist planned economy into capitalist free competition, making the economy a mess.

The Soviet revisionist clique has abandoned Lenin's great idea of "transforming agriculture with socialist principles." In state farms and collective farms, they advocate "dividing land to groups," fixing land to individuals, gradually turning state-owned farms and collective farms, which were originally socialist public ownership, into capitalist enterprises and farms. This has led to the development of a new rich peasant economy and caused serious polarization between the rich and the poor. They, who know nothing about agriculture, boast of being "agricultural experts," issuing various so-called agricultural policies, changing them frequently and erratically, causing great damage to Soviet agriculture.

Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin have messed up the Soviet economy, causing great suffering for the broad masses of the Soviet people. Yet, they shamelessly boast that the Soviet Union has entered the "construction of communism"!

In order to deceive the Soviet people and try to alleviate the growing resistance of the Soviet people, they put on a show of "caring for the people's welfare." On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, they sent out large numbers of people, running around everywhere, begging from all sides, buying leather shoes, coats, knitted goods, etc. from abroad to fill the already empty shelves and display windows, claiming to let the Soviet people see the "abundant fruits" of fifty years of "communist construction." This is a great insult to the great Soviet people! This is a great insult to the great October Revolution!

Great Lenin taught us: "Undoubtedly, the most important question for any revolution is the question of state power. Who holds state power, this determines everything." Brezhnev and Kosygin can run rampant in the Soviet Union, do as they please, implement bourgeois dictatorship, and carry out a comprehensive capitalist restoration, precisely because they have seized power, because they control the party, government, military, finance, and culture. However, no matter how cunning the Soviet revisionist leadership is, no matter how deceitful the Soviet revisionist leadership is, the heroic people of the Soviet Union, the homeland of great Lenin, will surely see through their reactionary nature, unite, and launch a fierce attack on the Soviet revisionist leadership, rebel against them, and seize their power!

A common Soviet drilling worker from Tajikistan once expressed the revolutionary will and firm determination of the 220 million Soviet people to us with resolute and powerful language: "There will surely be a second 1917 here!" This is the voice of struggle, the voice of revolution! The "second 1917" will surely come!

Long live Leninism!

    一定会有第二个一九一七年！
    贵州中国科学院地球化学研究所“列宁主义”战斗队
    苏修集团报刊上经常刊登这样的消息：苏联从外国购买这种吃的那种穿的，真是不一而足。
    我们中间一些到过苏联的同志也确曾亲眼看到：在今天的苏联，进口各式各样的蔬菜、水果、粮食、服装、皮鞋、日用百货等等。就蔬菜来说，在莫斯科，连我国四季不断的黄瓜、大葱、青菜、土豆、西红柿等普通的蔬菜都很少见；至于水果，那更是少得可怜。在挂着“水果和蔬菜”招牌的商店里，我们经常看到的是：阿联的大蒜、保加利亚的豆角、辣椒，朝鲜的苹果，东欧国家的西红柿、葡萄，还有别的什么国家的洋白菜……，而且价格昂贵。
    伟大的十月革命至今已经是五十周年了。苏联人民曾经在列宁的领导下，接着又在斯大林的领导下，同国内外阶级敌人进行了英勇的斗争，以自己艰苦的劳动，创造了强大的工业、农业、国防和科学，把经济落后的沙皇俄国建设成一个强大的社会主义国家。人们不禁要问：怎么今天连人们日常生活必需的蔬菜、水果和日用百货也要从国外进口呢？
    幅员辽阔，土地肥沃的苏联，今天竟连粮食、蔬菜、水果如此奇缺，这决不是一个孤立和偶然的现象。这是苏修叛徒集团篡党、篡政以来，推行修正主义政治路线，大肆破坏农业社会主义集体经济，进行全面资本主义复辟的必然结果。
    苏修集团背弃“政治同经济相比不能不占首位”的列宁主义原则，背叛无产阶级专政，抹杀无产阶级政治，大搞利润挂帅，在工农业中大力推行物质刺激为中心的所谓“新体制”，破坏集体经济基础，鼓吹个人利益，从而使资产阶级思想大泛滥，资本主义势力大猖獗，使原来社会主义的计划经济蜕变为资本主义的自由竞争，经济弄得一团糟。
    苏修集团背弃列宁关于“用社会主义原则改造农业”的伟大思想，在国营农场和集体农庄中大搞什么“分田到组”，把土地固定给个人，把原来是社会主义全民所有制的国营农场和集体所有制的集体农庄逐步变成了资本主义的企业和农庄，使新富农经济日益发展，造成严重的贫富两极分化。他们本来对农业一窍不通却硬要吹嘘自己是“农业里手”，颁布各式各样的所谓农业政策，朝令夕改，反复无常，使苏联农业遭到极大的破坏。
    赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流把苏联经济弄得一塌糊涂，使广大苏联人民大吃苦头，却还恬不知耻的吹牛说什么苏联进入了“共产主义”建设！
    他们为了欺骗苏联人民，企图缓和苏联人民日益增长的反抗，装出一副“关心人民福利”的样子，在十月革命五十周年的前夕，派出大批人员，四面奔走，八方求情，向外国购买皮鞋、大衣，针织品……以便充塞早已空荡荡的货架橱窗，说什么让苏联人民能够看到五十年“共产主义建设”的“丰硕果实”。这是对伟大苏联人民的极大侮辱！这是对伟大十月革命的极大侮辱！
    伟大的列宁教导我们：“毫无疑问，任何一个革命的最主要的问题都是国家政权问题。政权在哪一个阶级手里，这一点决定一切。”勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流能够在苏联横行霸道，为所欲为，实行资产阶级专政，全面复辟资本主义，就是因为他们窃取了政权，就是因为他们掌握党、政、军、财、文大权。但是，不论苏修领导集团如何奸诈，不管苏修领导集团怎样狡猾，伟大列宁故乡的英雄的苏联人民终究会看清他们的反动本质，团结起来，向苏修领导集团猛烈开火，造他们的反，夺他们的权！
    塔吉克一位普通的苏联钻探工人，曾以斩钉截铁、铿锵有力的语言，向我们表达了苏联两亿二千万人民的革命意志和坚定决心：“我们这里一定会有第二个一九一七年！”这是战斗的声音，革命的声音！“第二个一九一七年”一定会到来！
    列宁主义万岁！
