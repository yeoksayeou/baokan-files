Upon hearing the news of our country's successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb, the entire factory immediately erupted in excitement. Workers passed around this heartening news, shouting in joy over this glorious victory again and again.

At this moment, when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is achieving decisive victories, the successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb has occurred. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This victory greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary masses, greatly boosts the morale of the Chinese people, and greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people of the world. It thoroughly exposes the arrogance of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, thoroughly exposes the arrogance of imperialism, and thoroughly exposes the arrogance of Soviet revisionism. Imperialists and revisionists had asserted that the Chinese people would need a very long time to produce nuclear weapons. They used their nuclear weapons to blackmail people everywhere. However, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, armed with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, have, in a relatively short period of time, realized Chairman Mao's wise prophecy, mastered the technology to produce hydrogen bombs, and broken the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism. This is another great contribution of the Chinese people to the world revolution.

In just two years and eight months, our country has conducted five nuclear tests and successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb. This fact eloquently proves that once people grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they will generate boundless wisdom and strength, be able to do what previous generations dared not do, create miracles on earth, and scale the peak of science and technology.

We revolutionary masses of the proletariat must learn from the People's Liberation Army cadres and soldiers, workers, engineering and technical personnel, and scientific workers who are engaged in nuclear weapons research, manufacturing, and testing. We must learn from their advanced thinking of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and emphasizing proletarian politics. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." With practical actions, we will add brilliant colors to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are determined to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, fight to the end with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit. We will forever be pioneers of the revolution and models of production, and strive to make our factory a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    北京第二机床厂革命造反总部
    当我们听到我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的消息以后，全厂立刻沸腾起来，工人们相互传送这一振奋人心的消息，一遍又一遍欢呼这一辉煌的胜利。
    正在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时候，第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这一胜利，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大长了中国人民的志气，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风，大灭了帝国主义的威风，大灭了苏联修正主义的威风。帝国主义者和修正主义者，曾断言中国人民需要很长很长的时间才能生产核武器，他们利用手中的核武器到处进行讹诈。但是，中国人民在我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来，在不太长的时间里实现了毛主席的英明的预言，掌握了生产氢弹的技术，打破了帝国主义和修正主义的核垄断，这是中国人民对世界革命又一巨大的贡献。
    我国在两年零八个月的时间里进行五次核试验之后，又成功地爆炸了氢弹。这一事实，雄辩地证明，战无不胜的毛泽东思想一旦被人们掌握，就会产生无穷的智慧和力量，就可以做前人不敢做的事情，就可以创造人间的奇迹，就可以攀登科学技术的顶峰。
    我们无产阶级革命派，一定向从事核武器研究、制造和试验的中国人民解放军指战员、工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者学习，学习他们活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治的先进思想，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，用实际行动为无产阶级文化大革命增添灿烂的色彩。我们决心高举革命批判的大旗，同党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派斗争到底，并完成本单位的斗批改任务，永远做革命的闯将，永远做生产的模范，为把我们工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
