After the U.S. and Soviet Union manipulated the United Nations Security Council into passing a "ceasefire resolution," a cargo ship from the Soviet revisionist leadership eagerly entered the Strait of Tiran, which had just been seized by the Israeli aggressors, on June 8. This is the Soviet revisionists taking the lead in acknowledging Israel's occupation and acting as the vanguard for the U.S. and British imperialists' and Israel's scheme to turn the Gulf of Aqaba into an international waterway.

According to Western news agencies, the Soviet revisionists' public collusion with the U.S. and its tool, Israel, to betray the interests of the Arab people has pleased Israel. When the Soviet revisionist cargo ship passed through the strait, it was "honored" by Israeli torpedo boats.

In this serious struggle by the Arab people against the U.S.-Israeli aggression, the Soviet revisionist leadership's criminal actions of colluding with the U.S. have long been exposed. On June 3, a Soviet revisionist destroyer and an American destroyer met in the Mediterranean Sea, and both greeted each other with signals saying "good morning," both acting particularly friendly. The Soviet revisionist cargo ship passing through the Strait of Tiran on June 8 and serving the U.S. imperialists' tool, Israel, further exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership's vicious face of fake support and real betrayal of the Arab people.

### 以色列侵略者控制蒂朗海峡后  苏修货船最先驶入亚喀巴湾

    以色列侵略者控制蒂朗海峡后
    苏修货船最先驶入亚喀巴湾
    据新华社九日讯　在美苏操纵联合国安全理事会通过“停火决议”后，苏修领导集团的一艘货船就迫不及待地在八日首先驶入刚刚由以色列侵略者控制的蒂朗海峡。这是苏修带头承认以色列侵占，并为实现美英帝国主义和以色列力图把亚喀巴湾变为国际水道阴谋打先锋。
    据西方通讯社透露，苏修公开勾结美帝及其工具以色列叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的这一行为博得了以色列的欢心。当苏修货船通过海峡时，受到以色列鱼雷艇的“致敬”。
    在阿拉伯人民这一次反对美—以侵略的严重斗争中，苏修领导集团同美帝勾勾搭搭的罪恶行径早就暴露。六月三日，一艘苏修驱逐舰和一艘美国驱逐舰在地中海相遇时，双方又用信号互问“早安”，都表现得特别亲热。苏修货船六月八日通过蒂朗海峡，又为美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列效劳，这就更进一步暴露了苏修领导集团对阿拉伯人民假支持、真出卖的凶恶面目。
