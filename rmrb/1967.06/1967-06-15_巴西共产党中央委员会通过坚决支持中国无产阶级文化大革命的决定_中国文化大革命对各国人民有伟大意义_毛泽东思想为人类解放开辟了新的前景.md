The Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party passed a resolution in April 1967 to resolutely support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The detailed summary of this resolution is as follows:

The resolution first points out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is an epoch-making event in human history. Its significance and influence can only be compared to the October Revolution of 1917. The heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, have blazed a new trail for the thorough victory of socialism. The experiences gained from the Cultural Revolution have greatly enriched the theory of the proletariat. This revolution is so great that it will take a long time to fully assess all its lessons and its profound impact on the lives of people in various countries.

Only seventeen years have passed since the Chinese people seized power. However, due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China has entered a new stage of socialist revolution, a stage that the people of no other country have yet experienced. Mao Zedong Thought, the contemporary Marxism-Leninism, guides and inspires hundreds of millions of Chinese people to make great efforts to transform both people and society.

The Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party congratulates the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and its wise and tested helmsman, Comrade Mao Zedong. They are confident that, in addition to the achievements already made, new and outstanding achievements will be made.

The resolution states: Currently, China is engaged in intense class struggle. Even after the proletariat seizes power, there is still a long period of class struggle. The overthrown bourgeoisie is always trying to restore their rule. Their ideology has not died out and manifests itself in various fields of society, infiltrating the Party and finding spokesmen within it. These people, while claiming to be communists, actually pursue a line that serves the bourgeoisie. For a long time, they have opposed the revolutionary path and vigorously promoted their erroneous views.

In China, two opposing lines are engaged in a face-to-face struggle, and everyone must take a stand. One line is the proletarian revolutionary line advocated by Mao Zedong and supported by the vast majority of the people; the other is the reactionary bourgeois line peddled by a few Party leaders and supported by a very small number of people. One line relies on the masses, encourages their initiative and fighting spirit; the other line fears the masses, suppresses their enthusiasm, hinders their self-initiated struggle, and despises their potential revolutionary power. One line advocates new culture and opposes old ideas, customs, and habits; the other line opens the door to a culture that is essentially anti-socialist, promoting bourgeois ideas and habits. One line places politics and ideology first; the other line essentially emphasizes material incentives. One line leads to socialism, the other to capitalism.

The unprecedented mass movement sweeping across the vast territory of China aims to achieve the thorough victory of the proletarian line, ensure the continuation of the socialist revolution, and prevent the restoration of the power of the exploiters, avoiding a regression similar to that in the Soviet Union after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, where the achievements of the people were destroyed by revisionism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an objective necessity in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the path of thorough victory of socialism and the path of capitalism, after the overthrow of the exploiting classes. Experience has shown that the proletariat seizing power, achieving the public ownership of the means of production, and rapidly developing productive forces are not enough. Even eliminating illiteracy and achieving universal education are not enough. If a thorough ideological revolution is not carried out, if people's consciousness is not deeply transformed, and if the feudal and bourgeois ideas in people's minds are not thoroughly eliminated, the socialist revolution will degenerate and capitalism will eventually be restored. Therefore, the Cultural Revolution has become extremely necessary.

The resolution further points out: The Cultural Revolution is the greatest mass revolutionary movement in the world, fully embodying the Marxist view, creatively developed by Mao Zedong, on the role of the people in history. The people are the protagonists of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the people are carrying out profound changes in Asia, the largest country. Millions of workers, peasants, students, and soldiers are holding grand parades and demonstrations, actively participating in the political life of the state, exposing counter-revolutionaries, and pulling down those in power who are taking the capitalist road. They criticize all reactionary phenomena and expose anti-socialist thoughts.

The Cultural Revolution proves that the teachings of Marx and Engels on the liberation of the working class being the working class's own cause apply not only to the struggle to overthrow the old regime but also to the entire process of building a new society. Belief in the masses is of paramount importance. Treating the masses as pawns, making them passively follow the Party without initiative, is wrong and contrary to proletarian ideology. The Party can only lead by closely linking with the masses, encouraging their initiative, listening to their demands, summing up their experiences, and correctly guiding them on this basis.

The methods used in the Cultural Revolution are to guide the masses to liberate themselves through their own efforts, to educate themselves through their own experiences in the struggle. The Central Committee of the CPC pointed out in its August 1966 decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: "Let the masses educate themselves in this great revolutionary movement, to distinguish right from wrong, correct from incorrect." It is not right to do for the masses what they should do themselves. The leaders of China today could easily remove those who no longer represent the interests of the people with a stroke of the pen. However, this approach is not conducive to the political self-education of the masses. Therefore, no cadre within the Party and government who takes the capitalist road is removed through administrative means. Removal should be the result of the conscious activity of the masses. Ultimately, it is the masses who pull down those who pursue the reactionary bourgeois line.

Millions of people have raised their political consciousness and become active builders of socialism. A large number of pioneers have emerged, who are the successors of the revolutionary old generation. The Cultural Revolution has awakened the initiative and creativity of the masses, and countless men and women with talent, who are good at struggle, tenacious, and loyal to the people, are constantly being tested. They are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards in China have overturned all the privileges, prejudices, superstitions, customs, and habits inherent in the capitalist system and feudalism.

Contrary to the propaganda of imperialists and revisionists, the workers in China, while actively participating in the Cultural Revolution and raising their class consciousness, have also made production develop even faster. The industrial growth indicators for last year show that China's economy has made significant progress. The agricultural production of 1966 was the best year in history. China's innovators, technicians, and scientists are increasing exponentially, and China has achieved great technological progress, reaching the level of producing highly complex and perfect machines and tools. Look, the missile and nuclear tests have been completely successful! The masses, while seizing the revolution, are promoting the rapid growth of production.

Thus, the future of China and the future of the socialist revolution are more firmly in the hands of the broad masses. The experience of the masses prominently appearing on the Chinese political stage should be cherished by revolutionaries around the world. Our Party should learn from this brilliant example. If communists cannot believe in the people, arouse their awareness, mobilize and organize the people to carry out the revolution themselves, they cannot fulfill their role. Anything that hinders communists from approaching the masses and uniting with them—the sectarianism, isolationism, superiority complex, and self-righteousness—must be opposed. This is a fundamental condition for achieving revolutionary victory in our country.

The resolution further points out: Through the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people have pushed the struggle for freedom, which people have been waging for thousands of years, to a new stage. Proletarian democracy has reached an unprecedented breadth. The broad laboring masses freely express their opinions and frankly express their lofty will. Today, the freedom enjoyed by the Chinese people is something that the people of any other country have never enjoyed.

Whether in cities or in the countryside, walls are covered with millions of big-character posters, strongly reflecting the reformist sentiments of the masses. Through this unique big-character poster, everyone can say what they think and feel what they think. Whether in courtyards or on squares, there are mass debates organized by the people themselves. Without prior approval, meetings and parades are held everywhere. Tens of thousands of Red Guards march across the country, bringing the fire of revolution. The right to criticize is enjoyed by everyone and permeates national life. No one, no matter how high their position, can avoid the criticism of the people.

The resolution further points out: The democracy practiced in China today truly conforms to the Marxist-Leninist thought on the dictatorship of the proletariat: giving the people broad freedom and waging merciless struggle against the enemies of socialism. This has nothing in common with bourgeois democracy, which in reality means giving democracy only to the rich and exploiters, while almost all the people's rights are stripped away. In China, no one hinders the activities of students, soldiers, workers, and peasants; they freely express their views and push their revolution forward. Meanwhile, in the United States, blacks are brutally persecuted; in the Soviet Union, student anti-American demonstrations are dispersed by force; in Indonesia, tens of thousands of patriots are massacred to intimidate them; in Brazil, people live under the iron fist of a military dictatorship serving American imperialism.

Chinese proletarian democracy exposes the lies of the reactionaries who claim that socialism and democracy are incompatible. The Cultural Revolution shows that the freedom enjoyed by the working class is an essential quality of true socialism. It is capitalism that reveals its incompatibility with the democracy of the people.

The resolution states: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has played a decisive role in mobilizing the Chinese people to prepare for a confrontation with the United States and its accomplices. The aggression against Vietnam and the Pentagon's policy of "gradual escalation" in Southeast Asia are part of the global strategy of American monopolists, whose core is to encircle and attack China.

The Cultural Revolution has awakened the political consciousness of the broad masses, making everyone more aware of the need to overthrow American imperialism, the most vicious enemy of humanity. The internationalist spirit of hundreds of millions of Chinese people has been strengthened, and China's fraternal aid to Vietnam embodies an unprecedented level of support among the peoples of various countries. The vast majority of the Chinese people are willing to make the greatest sacrifices to defend the achievements of the revolution and cooperate with the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world.

The Chinese people have prepared for the possibility of war, fearing neither the threats of the White House nor the collusion of the Soviet Union and the United States, nor the consequences of a nuclear attack. The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has higher morale than any army in the world. Millions of Red Guard youth are a vast reserve force for this heroic army, making China even stronger. Today, any invader, whether an imperialist or a revisionist, will be defeated the moment they set foot on Chinese soil, as they will encounter an invincible and fearless warrior in every Chinese person.

The resolution points out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with its stormy impact, has created a new type of person. For the thorough victory of socialism, such new-type people are needed, who are completely free from the old customs and superstitions of the former class society. This is a revolution that touches the soul. Selfishness, personal ambition, seeking official rank and wealth, and all private thoughts have no place in those who strive for such a magnificent cause as communism.

The Cultural Revolution has contributed to the establishment of true proletarian morality in society. The foundation of this morality is "public" over "private."

Therefore, in China, this issue is greatly emphasized. The task of cultivating new people is a complex and difficult one that will take a long time. The Cultural Revolution has seriously and comprehensively addressed this issue, and to a large extent, this issue determines the fate of socialism. In this regard, Mao Zedong Thought plays a guiding role. "The Three Articles"—"In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "In Honor of the People"—with their profound ideological content, with their selfless spirit, hard struggle, modesty, heroism, and selflessness, educate the broad masses of the Chinese people.

The Cultural Revolution loudly advocates daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act—these are the true colors of a revolutionary. The Cultural Revolution has raised these issues, touching the souls of everyone; examining people's morality, especially that of communists; and exposing everything bourgeois and petty-bourgeois in the personal behavior and social activities of many people, including important Party members. The Cultural Revolution has shown that many people lag behind the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement or have deviated from the correct path. It is evident that people need to constantly rely on self-criticism to transform themselves, so that everyone can break away from erroneous thoughts and walk the path of socialism.

The resolution emphasizes: Mao Zedong has wisely seen the necessity of the Cultural Revolution, an indispensable stage of the socialist revolution, and has formulated the general line of the Cultural Revolution. For a long time, he has analyzed the practice of the masses and, based on the initiative of the masses, formulated a line that leads the movement to achieve greater and greater successes. Thus, he has made new and outstanding theoretical and practical contributions to the struggle of the working class and all oppressed people.

Mao Zedong is the most loyal representative of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. As Lenin taught, the proletarian doctrine formulated by Marx and Engels is not a dogma but a tool for the struggle of the oppressed classes, a tool for the liberation struggle of the peoples of various countries, which must answer the questions posed by life and be constantly enriched through revolutionary practice. In every era, there will be people who are proficient in Marxism, creatively apply it, greatly develop it, and raise it to a new peak. Lenin, in his era, not only brilliantly interpreted Marxism but also enriched it with new theories and conclusions. Leninism became the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. His contribution to Marxism is so great that his name is inseparably linked with the theory of the proletariat. Stalin also made Marxism shine brightly, achieving outstanding results in leading the Soviet Party and state. Mao Zedong is good at creatively applying Marxism under Chinese conditions, leading the Chinese people from victory to victory until they achieve complete liberation from the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

In philosophy, economics, social sciences, military science, and Party building, Mao Zedong's contributions to Marxism-Leninism are innumerable. Mao Zedong Thought has answered the most urgent questions of reality, greatly enriching the theory of revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Mao Zedong has formulated the theory and principles of people's war, which have been proven correct not only in China but also in many other places. The Chinese people are building socialism according to his teachings, turning their country into a powerful and invincible one. Today, in the great struggle against modern revisionism waged by the peoples of various countries, Mao Zedong is the main thinker and guide. He has given the peoples of various countries the sharpest weapon for the struggle for liberation, bringing Marxism-Leninism to a new height.

Therefore, the Chinese people and revolutionaries of various countries, in order to complete their tasks, are striving to learn Mao Zedong Thought. In China, every company, every factory, every school, and every people's commune have become schools for learning Mao Zedong Thought. People strive to apply Mao Zedong Thought in their daily activities, so Marxism-Leninism is used by ordinary people to solve daily problems, dialectical materialism truly becomes a tool used by the masses, and proletarian ideology grasps the masses, occupying the positions previously occupied by the ideology of the former exploiting classes. Such large-scale learning of Marxism will undoubtedly bring about a qualitative change in the people's thinking and Chinese society.

The resolution states: Such a broad and profound movement as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution inevitably arouses the hatred and hostility of reactionary forces, as well as those old communists who have not studied proletarian theory well. The greatest obstacle to the Cultural Revolution comes from those who hold important positions in the Party and government and pursue a line leading to capitalism. Due to their positions, these people have become serious obstacles to the forward development of the revolution. The mass movement of the Cultural Revolution is directed against them. These people, who may have had merits in the past, will have to step aside if they insist on their erroneous positions and do not engage in self-criticism. If this is not done, red China will be in danger of changing color. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has expelled opportunists and bureaucrats from the Party, tempered true communists, and strengthened the true socialist left.

Imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries have all risen up to oppose the Cultural Revolution. American monopolists, Soviet revisionists, British Labour Party members, Japanese militarists, Indian ruling cliques, Yugoslav traitors, parties following the orders of the CPSU, and all reactionary scum have gathered in the "sacred alliance" against China. They viciously and madly attack the Cultural Revolution, spreading lies and slanders. In this anti-China movement, Johnson and Kosygin, United Press International and TASS, the New York Times and Pravda are indistinguishable. They strive to distort facts and deceive public opinion. These reactionaries and opportunists, when opposing China, all concentrate their attacks on Mao Zedong. They hate Mao Zedong because Mao Zedong, with his wisdom and strong hand, is leading the Chinese people and is the leader of the revolutionary peoples of various countries in their struggle for national liberation, democracy, and socialism.

The anti-China movement has proven that imperialists and revisionists are in a state of panic and hostility towards the Cultural Revolution. American warmongers know that the Cultural Revolution has set up an insurmountable obstacle to their plan for global hegemony, heralding the doom of imperialism. Soviet revisionists know that the Cultural Revolution will expose their policy of betraying socialism and help the laboring masses of the Soviet Union rise up against the Khrushchev clique that controls the Party and state machinery.

The resolution further states: The reactionaries in our country are also fiercely attacking the Cultural Revolution. Bourgeois newspapers do not have a single day without heaping curses on the Cultural Revolution, all with the purpose of preventing the people from knowing the truth. This is fear of the growing revolutionary forces in the world, fear of the Brazilian people taking the path to liberation.

The revisionists of the Brazilian Communist Party have also joined the reactionaries and agents of American imperialism in the chorus against the Cultural Revolution, using shameful resolutions to curse the great Chinese people who have completed the greatest revolution in history and are now holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Thus, they have further exposed their deeply rooted opportunist nature and their ugly face of following the orders of the CPSU.

It is unimaginable that such a great movement as the Cultural Revolution could proceed quietly without thoroughly disrupting the old order. Those who are surprised by the secondary aspects of the mass's violent actions do not understand what true revolution is. And true revolution, as Mao Zedong said, "is not writing articles, not painting or embroidering, it cannot be so elegant, so leisurely, so polite and restrained, so gentle and modest. Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another class."

The resolution further states: Today, in China, millions of people directly participate in political events, and they are the driving force of the cultural revolution. One cannot confuse the great and well-deserved prestige of Mao Zedong and the respect and love of the vast majority of the Chinese people and laboring people of the world for him with "personality cult." It is very beneficial for the world revolution that the oppressed and exploited peoples of China and various countries have such a great and talented leader. Having such a leader, with both extremely high prestige and rare and precious leadership abilities, is a blessing for humanity. Mao Zedong correctly reflects the needs of social development, accurately expresses the aspirations and ideals of the broad masses, and points out the reliable path for the liberation struggle of the peoples of various countries. His leadership position is not imposed but is established in long-term struggle. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely proven by life in long-term struggle. Raising high the name of Mao Zedong and spreading his thoughts is to promote the revolution forward. The revisionists use the so-called "personality cult" to attack the Cultural Revolution; they are nothing but hypocrites and enemies of socialism. Today, as yesterday, they raise the "personality cult" to blacken Marxism-Leninism, attempting to promote their opportunist views and disarm the people in their struggle against imperialism.

Brazilian revolutionaries are happy about the achievements of the Cultural Revolution.

The resolution emphasizes: The Cultural Revolution in China has great significance for the peoples of various countries. This is not only because it is taking place in a country with a quarter of the world's population but also because it is addressing issues directly related to the world revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China fights against abnormal social phenomena and strives for a new society without privileges, thus winning the sympathy of the suffering peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a higher stage of the socialist revolution, providing invaluable help to the workers' movement, the struggle for national liberation, and the Marxist-Leninist left in countries ruled by revisionism. Like the greatest revolutions in history, it is a great example influencing the lives of the peoples of various countries. Although the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries are not yet in the stage of the Cultural Revolution, the Cultural Revolution in China has given their entire revolutionary movement a new ideology, style, and prospect.

China has defeated its domestic enemies, strengthened its economic and military power, and achieved an unbreakable unity of the people in politics and ideology, thus being able to better play the role of the main base of the world revolutionary movement. China has become the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the plunder plans of American imperialists, so they concentrate their forces to prepare for a war against China. While the oppressed peoples and laboring people of the world all regard China as their strongest ally and stand with China against the machinations of the Soviet Union and the United States.

The resolution finally states: The Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party expresses its most enthusiastic and complete support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the revolutionary faction of China. The leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, tempered by countless class struggles, will certainly overcome any obstacles, and the Chinese people will certainly defeat all those who oppose China's march towards socialism. Mao Zedong Thought has opened up new prospects for humanity to be liberated from the shackles of capitalism. Our Central Committee is convinced that the Communist Party of China and the proletarian dictatorship of China, after this historic struggle, will be further strengthened and will be able to better fulfill their new mission.

Brazilian communists should pay more attention to the development of the Cultural Revolution in China and learn from its valuable experience. The Central Committee believes that to educate Party members with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and to better understand the urgent problems of our revolution, we must learn from the works of Mao Zedong. This will help us to more deeply analyze the reality of Brazil and to correctly apply the universal truths of Marxism to our revolutionary practice.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Brazilian Communist Party and the Communist Party of China!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the laboring people of the world, Mao Zedong!

    巴西共产党中央委员会通过坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命的决定
    中国文化大革命对各国人民有伟大意义
    毛泽东思想为人类解放开辟了新的前景
    新华社十四日讯　巴西共产党中央委员会一九六七年四月通过了关于坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命的决定。这个决定的详细摘要如下：
    决定首先指出：当前，中国所进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上划时代的事件。它的意义和影响，只有一九一七年十月革命才能和它相比。英勇的中国人民，在毛泽东和中国共产党的领导下，为社会主义的彻底胜利开辟了一条崭新的道路。文化大革命所产生的经验，极大地丰富了无产阶级的学说。这个革命是这样的伟大，因此，还需要很长的时间才能全面地估价它所包含的全部教益，和它在各国人民生活中必将产生的深远影响。
    中国人民在夺取政权之后，仅仅过去了十七年。然而中国由于无产阶级文化大革命，却进入了社会主义革命的一个新阶段，这个阶段是其他任何国家的人民都还没有走过的。毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，指导和鼓舞着亿万中国群众，以极大的努力来改造人和改造社会。
    巴西共产党中央委员会祝贺无产阶级文化大革命，及其英明的、久经考验的舵手毛泽东同志。并确信：他们除了已经取得的成果之外，必将取得新的杰出的成就。
    决定说：当前，中国正在进行着紧张的阶级斗争。在无产阶级夺取政权之后的一个长时期内，还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。被推翻的资产阶级，时刻都在企图恢复他们的统治。他们的思想还没死，还在社会的各个领域表现出来，并且侵袭共产党内部，在党内找到了代言人，这些人虽然自称是共产党员，而实际上却实行一条为资产阶级效劳的路线。很久以来，他们就反对革命道路，极力推行他们的错误主张。
    在中国，两条对立的路线正在进行着面对面的斗争，每一个人都必须在它们面前表示态度。一条路线是毛泽东所坚持的，并为绝大多数人民所拥护的无产阶级革命路线；另一条路线是几个共产党领导人所贩卖的，只有极少数人支持的资产阶级反动路线。一条路线是依靠群众，依靠他们的首创精神，鼓励他们的主动性和斗争意志；另一条路线是害怕群众，压制他们的积极性，阻挠他们自己起来斗争，瞧不起他们的潜在的革命力量。一条路线是面向新文化，反对旧思想、旧风俗和旧习惯；另一条路线是为实质上反社会主义的文化大开方便之门，宣扬资产阶级的观念和习惯。一条路线是把政治和思想放在第一位；另一条路线本质上是突出物质刺激。一条路线是要走向社会主义，另一条路线是要走向资本主义。
    遍及全中国广大国土上的空前的群众运动，其目的就是要争取无产阶级路线的彻底胜利，保证社会主义革命继续进行下去，也是为了防止剥削者的政权复辟，避免发生类似苏联那样的倒退，苏联自苏共二十大之后，人民的成果就被修正主义摧毁了。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是在推翻了剥削阶级之后，在无产阶级和资产阶级之间，也就是社会主义彻底胜利的道路和资本主义道路之间所进行的斗争的一个客观需要。经验证明，无产阶级仅仅夺取政权，仅仅实现生产资料的公有化，仅仅取得生产力的迅速增长，还是不够的。仅仅完成扫除文盲和实行全民教育，也还是不够的。如果不进行思想革命，不深刻地改造人们的意识，不彻底地破除存在于人们头脑里的封建思想和资产阶级思想，社会主义革命就会蜕化变质，资本主义终将复辟。因此，文化大革命就变得极其必要了。
    决定又指出：文化大革命是全世界最大的一次群众革命运动，最完满地体现了由毛泽东所创造性地发展了的马克思主义关于人民群众在历史上的作用的观点。人民是无产阶级文化大革命的主角。伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞下的人民群众，正在亚洲这个最大的国家进行着深刻的变革。千百万工人、农民、学生和士兵，举行浩浩荡荡的游行示威，积极参与国家的政治生活，揭露反革命分子，把那些走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马，批判一切反动的现象，揭露反社会主义的思想。
    文化大革命证明，马克思和恩格斯关于劳动者的解放是劳动者自己的事业的教导，不仅适用于推翻旧政权的斗争，而且也适用于建设新社会的全部过程。相信群众是头等重要的问题。把群众当阿斗，要他们消极无为地跟着党，这样的作法是错误的，是与无产阶级思想格格不入的。党只有善于紧密地联系群众，鼓励他们的首创精神，听取他们的要求，总结他们的经验，并在这个基础上，正确地引导他们，才能起到党的领导作用。
    文化大革命所采用的方法，是引导群众通过自己的努力来解放自己，引导他们以自己的经验，在斗争的过程中自己教育自己。中共中央在一九六六年八月关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定中指出：“要让群众在这个大革命运动中，自己教育自己，去识别那些是对的，那些是错的，那些做法是正确的，那些做法是不正确的。”包办代替群众去作那些本来是他们自己的事情，那是不行的。中国今天的领导人，本来只要大笔一挥，就可轻而易举地撤掉那些再也不代表人民利益的人。但是这种作法，不利于群众在政治上自我教育。所以，没有一个党内和政府内走资本主义道路的当权派，是通过行政手段撤职。撤职应当是群众自觉活动的结果。归根到底，把那些推行资产阶级反动路线的人拉下马的是群众。
    千百万人提高了政治觉悟，成为积极的社会主义建设者。涌现出了大批的闯将，他们是革命的老一代的接班人。文化大革命唤醒了群众的积极性和创造性，出现了无数的男女，他们有才干，善于斗争，坚韧不拔，对人民忠心耿耿，每时每刻都在经受着考验。他们是无产阶级文化大革命的先锋。红卫兵在中国社会上大造其反，把资本主义制度和封建主义所固有的各种特权、偏见、迷信、风俗和习惯统统都打翻在地。
    与帝国主义者和修正主义者的宣传相反，中国的劳动者在积极参加文化大革命，提高他们的阶级觉悟的同时，也使生产更快地向前发展了。去年工业增长的指标表明，中国的经济有了显著的发展。一九六六年中国的农业生产，是历史上最好的年景。中国的革新能手、技术人员和科学家在成倍的增加，中国在技术上取得了伟大的成就，发展到具备生产十分复杂和完美的机器和工具的水平。请看，导弹核试验取得了完全的成功！群众在抓革命的同时，促使生产飞速的增长。
    这样，中国的未来和社会主义革命的未来，就更加掌握在广大群众的手中。群众这样突出地出现在中国政治舞台上，这个经验应当引起全世界的革命者的珍视。我们党应该学习这个光辉的范例。共产党人若不能相信人民，唤起人民的觉悟，动员人民和组织人民，让他们自己进行革命，那么就不能起到自己的作用。凡是妨碍共产党人接近群众，同群众打成一片的东西——宗派主义，关门主义，优越感，自以为是等等，都应当反对。这是要想在我国取得革命胜利的一个根本条件。
    决定接着指出：中国人民通过文化大革命，把人们千百年以来为自由而进行的斗争推向了一个新阶段。无产阶级民主达到了从来也没有过的广度。广大的劳动群众自由地发表意见，坦率地表达他们的崇高意志。今天，中国人民所享受的自由，是任何其他国家的人民从来都没有享受过的。
    不论在城市，还是在农村，墙壁上都贴满了千百万张大字报，强烈地反映出群众的革新情绪。通过这种独一无二的大字报，每一个人想到什么就讲什么，感到什么就讲什么。不论在大院内或在广场上，都有群众自己组织起来的大辩论。不必经过事先的批准，各地都举行集会和游行。成千上万的红卫兵走向全国各地，带去革命之火。批评的权利人人都有，贯穿于国家生活之中。任何人，不管他的职位多高，也不能不接受人民的批评。
    决定又指出：今天在中国实行的民主，真正符合马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的思想：给人民以广泛的自由，对社会主义的敌人进行无情的斗争。这与资产阶级民主没有丝毫共同之处，资产阶级民主实际上意味着只给富人和剥削者以民主，而几乎全体人民的权利则被他们剥夺了。在中国没有任何人阻挠学生、战士、工人、农民的活动，他们自由地表达自己的观点，把自己的革命推向前进。而与此同时，在美国，黑人受到粗暴的迫害；在苏联，学生的反美示威被武力驱散；在印度尼西亚，为了恐吓爱国者屠杀了几十万人；在巴西，人民生活在为美帝国主义效劳的军事独裁的铁掌之下。
    中国的无产阶级民主，揭穿了反动派的宣传谎言，他们说什么社会主义和民主是不相容的。文化大革命表明，劳动者享受自由，这是真正的社会主义所固有的本质。正是资本主义才暴露出它同人民的民主是不相调和的。
    决定说：无产阶级文化大革命，为动员中国人民作好对付美国及其帮凶的准备，起了决定性的作用。对越南的侵略和五角大楼在东南亚的“逐步升级”政策，是美国垄断资本家全球战略的组成部分，这个战略的核心就是包围和进攻中国。
    文化大革命唤醒了广大群众的政治觉悟，使每个人更加懂得必须打倒美帝国主义这个人类最凶恶的敌人。亿万中国人民的国际主义精神加强了，中国对越南的兄弟般的援助，体现了各国人民关系中从未有过的支持。绝大多数中国人民表示要作出最大的牺牲，来保卫革命成果，同全世界被压迫的人民争取解放的斗争合作。
    中国人民对战争的可能性作了准备，不怕白宫的威胁，不怕苏美勾结，也不怕原子弹攻击的后果。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，士气比全世界任何军队都高。千百万红卫兵青年，是这支英雄的军队的广大的后备军，他们使中国变得更加强大了。今天，一切侵略者，不论他是帝国主义者，还是修正主义者，只要踏上中国的土地，他所遇到的每一个中国人，也就是一个无所畏惧的、不可战胜的战士，因此他就一定会被击败。
    决定指出：无产阶级文化大革命，以其疾风暴雨的冲击，造就了一种新人。为了社会主义的彻底胜利，需要这种新型的人，他们完全脱离了从前的阶级社会的陈规陋俗、邪门歪道。这是触及人们灵魂的一次革命。什么自私自利，个人野心，升官发财，一切私心杂念，在为共产主义这样宏伟的事业而奋斗的人们身上是不能有容身之地的。
    文化大革命对确立真正的无产阶级道德在社会上的优势作出了贡献。这个道德的基石就是“公”字压倒“私”字。
    所以，在中国，十分强调这个问题。造就新人的任务是一个复杂和困难的任务，需要很长的时间。文化大革命严肃地、全面地看待了这个问题，在很大程度上这个问题决定着社会主义的命运。在这方面，毛泽东思想起着指导的作用。“老三篇”——《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《为人民服务》，以其深刻的思想性，以忘我的精神、艰苦奋斗、谦虚谨慎、英雄主义、毫不利己、专门利人来教育广大的中国群众。
    文化大革命大张旗鼓地强调要敢想、敢说、敢干——这是真正的革命者的本色。文化大革命把这些问题都提出来了，触及了每个人的灵魂；检验了人们的品德，尤其是共产党员的品德；把许多人，包括党的重要成员，他们的个人行为和社会活动中，凡是资产阶级的和小资产阶级的东西，统统揭出来了。文化大革命说明了，很多人落后于中国革命运动的发展，或者离开了正确的方向。突出地看出，人们需要经常靠自我批评来改造自己，使大家都脱离错误的思想，走社会主义的道路。
    决定强调指出：毛泽东英明地看出了文化大革命的必要性，是社会主义革命不可缺少的阶段，并制定了文化大革命的总方针。他长久以来分析了群众的实践，并且根据群众的首创精神，制定了一条引导运动取得一次比一次更大的成就的路线。这样，他就给工人阶级和所有被压迫者的斗争，作出了新的、卓越的理论和实践上的贡献。
    毛泽东是当代马克思列宁主义的最忠实的代表。正如列宁教导的，马克思和恩格斯所制定的无产阶级学说，不是教条，而是被剥削阶级进行斗争的工具，是各国人民争取解放的工具，它要回答生活所提出的问题，并且要从革命活动中不断地加以丰富。在每个时代，都会出现一些人，他们精通马克思主义，创造性地运用它，大大地发展它，把它提高到一个新的顶峰上去。列宁在他所生活的时代，不仅天才地解释了，而且以新的理论和结论丰富了马克思主义。列宁主义成为帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。他对马克思主义的贡献是如此的伟大，使得他的名字和无产阶级的理论不可磨灭地联系在一起。斯大林也使马克思主义大放光采，他在领导苏维埃党和国家中，取得了卓越的成就。毛泽东善于在中国的条件下，创造性地运用马克思主义，引导中国人民从胜利走向胜利，直至从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治下获得彻底的解放。
    在哲学、经济学、社会科学、军事学和党的建设方面，毛泽东对马克思列宁主义的贡献是数不尽的。毛泽东思想回答了现实最迫切的问题，大大地丰富了关于殖民地和附属国革命的理论。毛泽东制定了人民战争学说和人民战争原则，其正确性不仅在中国得到了证实，而且在其他许多地方也得到了证实。中国人民正在根据他的教导，建设社会主义，把他们的国家变成一个强大的不可战胜的国家。今天，在各国人民对现代修正主义所开展的伟大斗争中，毛泽东是主要的思想家和导师。他把争取解放斗争的最锐利武器交给了各国人民，使马克思列宁主义达到了一个新的高度。
    正因为如此，中国人民和各国的革命者，为了完成他们的任务，都在努力地学习毛泽东思想。在中国，每个连队，每个工厂，每个学校和每个人民公社，都成了学习毛泽东思想的大学校。人们努力在日常的活动中应用毛泽东思想，这样，马克思列宁主义就为平凡的人们用来解决日常的问题，辩证唯物主义真正成了群众所运用的工具，无产阶级思想掌握了群众，占领了被从前的剥削阶级思想所占领的阵地。这种大规模的学习马克思主义，毫无疑问，将使人民的思想和中国社会来一个质的变化。
    决定说：象无产阶级文化大革命这样广泛而深刻的运动，必然会引起反动势力的痛恨和敌视，也会引起那些没有学好无产阶级理论的旧共产党人的痛恨和敌视。文化大革命的最大阻力，来自一些身居党政要职、执行一条走向资本主义的路线的人们那里。由于他们的地位，这些人成了革命向前发展的严重阻碍。文化大革命的群众运动的锋芒就是指向他们。这些人，有的即使在过去是有功劳的，但是，如果他们坚持错误立场，不作自我批评，就要靠边站。若不这样办的话，红色的中国将有改变颜色的危险。无产阶级文化大革命，把机会主义者和官僚主义者清除出党，锻炼了真正的共产党人，加强了真正的社会主义的左派。
    帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派都起来反对文化大革命。美国垄断资本家，苏联修正主义者，英国工党分子，日本军国主义者，印度统治集团，南斯拉夫叛徒，服从苏共指挥棒的党，所有反动的渣滓，他们都纠集在反华的“神圣同盟”里了。他们恶毒地、疯狂地攻击文化大革命，又是造谣，又是诽谤。在这个反华运动中，约翰逊和柯西金，合众国际社和塔斯社，《纽约时报》和《真理报》毫无差别。他们尽力歪曲事实，欺骗公众舆论。这些反动派和机会主义者，在反对中国的时候，都集中攻击毛泽东。他们之所以仇恨毛泽东，因为毛泽东正以他的智慧和坚强的手领导着中国人民，他是各国革命人民争取民族解放、民主和社会主义的领袖。
    反华运动证明了，帝国主义者和修正主义者对文化大革命感到惊慌失措。美国好战分子知道，文化大革命给他们称霸全球的计划设立了一个不可逾越的障碍，预兆了帝国主义的末日。苏联修正主义者知道，文化大革命会揭露他们背叛社会主义的政策，帮助苏联劳动群众起来反对控制党和国家机器的赫鲁晓夫集团。
    决定接着又说：我国的反动派也在激烈地攻击文化大革命。资产阶级报纸没有一天不是连篇累牍地咒骂文化大革命，其目的都是为了不让人民了解真相。这是对世界革命力量日益增长的恐惧，是对巴西人民群众走上解放道路的恐惧。
    巴西的共产党的修正主义者们也加入了反动派和美帝国主义代理人反对文化大革命的大合唱，他们通过可耻的决议，大肆咒骂完成了历史上最伟大的革命、今天又高举马列主义大旗的伟大的中国人民。这样，他们就进一步暴露了自己的根深蒂固的机会主义面目，进一步暴露了他们跟着苏共指挥棒转的丑恶的面
  目。
    不能设想，象文化大革命这样大的运动能冷冷清清地进行，而不会全面地打乱过去的秩序。那些只对群众的猛烈行动的次要方面表示大惊小怪的人，就不懂得真正的革命是什么。而真正的革命，就象毛泽东所说的：“不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”
    决定又说：而今天，在中国，千百万人直接参与政治事件，他们是文化革命的动力。不能把毛泽东的巨大的、当之无愧的威望，不能把绝大多数的中国人民和全世界劳动人民对他的尊敬和热爱同“个人迷信”混为一谈。中国和各国被剥削被压迫的人民有这样一位天才的伟大的领袖，这是十分有利于世界革命的。有这样一位领袖，既有极高的威望，又有罕见的可贵的领导才能，这是人类的幸福。毛泽东正确地反映了社会发展的需要，准确地表达了广大群众的愿望和理想，指出了各国人民解放斗争的可靠道路。他的领袖地位不是强加的，而是在长期斗争中确定下来的，毛泽东思想是在长期斗争中被生活广泛证实了的。高举毛泽东的名字，传播他的思想，就是推动革命向前进。修正主义者玩弄所谓“个人迷信”来攻击文化大革命，他们只不过是十足的伪君子，是社会主义的敌人。今天和昨天一样，他们祭起“个人迷信”来给马列主义抹黑，企图推行他们的机会主义观点，解除人民反对帝国主义斗争的武装。
    巴西的革命者为文化大革命的成就而感到高兴。
    决定强调指出：中国的文化大革命对各国人民都有伟大的意义。这不仅仅因为它是在一个占世界人口四分之一的国家进行的，还因为它所要解决的问题是和世界革命直接有关的问题。中国的文化大革命同不正常的社会现象进行斗争，争取一个没有特权的新社会，因此赢得了亚非拉苦难的人民的同情。
    无产阶级文化大革命是社会主义革命的更高阶段，对工人运动，对民族解放斗争，对修正主义统治的各国的马列主义左派的帮助，是无可估量的。如同历史上各次最伟大的革命一样，它是影响各国人民生活的伟大榜样。虽然殖民地和附属国各国人民当前所处的时期还不是文化大革命时期，但是中国的文化大革命却赋予他们整个革命运动以崭新的思想、风格和前景。
    中国打倒了国内的敌人，加强了经济威力和军事威力，有了人民在政治上和思想上的牢不可破的团结，就能够更好地发挥世界革命运动的主要根据地的作用。中国成了美帝国主义者推行其掠夺计划的最大障碍，因此他们集中力量进行反华战争准备。而全世界被压迫的人民和劳动者，都把中国看作是自己最强大的盟友，并且同中国站在一起反对苏美阴谋。
    决定最后说：巴西共产党中央委员会表示最热烈地、完全地支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，支持中国的革命派。经过千百次阶级斗争考验的毛泽东同志的领导必将战胜任何阻碍，中国人民必将打倒一切反对中国走向社会主义的人。毛泽东思想为人类从资本主义枷锁下解放出来开辟了新的前景。我们中央委员会确信，中国共产党和中国的无产阶级专政，经过这场具有历史意义的斗争，必将得到进一步的加强，必将能更好地完成其新的使命。
    巴西共产党人应当更加关心中国的文化大革命的发展，吸取它的宝贵的经验。中央委员会认为，要以马克思列宁主义精神教育党员，要更好地理解我国革命的迫切问题，就必须学习毛泽东著作。这会有助于我们更深刻地去分析巴西的现实，有助于我们把马克思主义的普遍真理正确地应用于我们的革命实践。
    巴西共产党和中国共产党之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    中国人民和全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！
