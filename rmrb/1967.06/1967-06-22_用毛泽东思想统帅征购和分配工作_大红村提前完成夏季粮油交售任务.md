The selfless Communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, who dedicated his life to the public, hailed from Dàhóng Village in Huábīn Commune, Féidōng County, Anhui Province. The poor and lower-middle peasants of this village have diligently studied and implemented Chairman Mao's teachings on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." They have emphasized proletarian politics and used the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide the summer distribution and procurement work. On June 18, they completed the summer grain and oil procurement tasks ahead of schedule.

This year, Dàhóng Village's summer crops have seen a bumper harvest, the likes of which have rarely been seen in recent years. The total wheat yield has increased significantly, and oil crops and other crops have also had a good harvest. This is a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Last year, during the wheat sowing season, there was a prolonged drought. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party spread the fallacy of "relying on heaven for food," dampening the revolutionary spirit of the commune members. The stationed troops of a certain unit organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production," "make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and to establish the idea of "man conquers nature." Through studying Chairman Mao's works, the commune members' revolutionary spirit was further invigorated. They dug ditches to divert water, fought against the drought to ensure sowing, and sowed in a timely manner, foiling the enemy's plot. Later, when wheat urgently needed fertilizer, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party again spread the evil wind of economism, inciting farmers to divide the public accumulation fund, leaving the production team without money to buy fertilizer. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw through the enemy's tricks. On one hand, they fought back against the enemy, and on the other hand, they dug up pond mud and sent it as fertilizer, finally applying enough fertilizer to ensure a bumper wheat harvest. The poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said, "This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a fruitful result of the Cultural Revolution." "The grain we harvested this year is 'political grain.'"

During the grain distribution and summer grain and oil procurement process, due to the influence of anarchist and individualist thoughts, some people advocated "distributing everything" and "procuring less grain." The stationed troops, revolutionary cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants discussed this issue specifically. They believed that summer procurement is an important political task to ensure the national grain supply and support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction. To do a good job in summer procurement and distribution, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, implement policies, and organize commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, starting from the overall situation and considering the interests of the state, collective, and individuals.

They organized the commune members to use reporting meetings and other forms to learn from Cai Yongxiang, the martyr, and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's teachings on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and "considering the overall situation." An old poor peasant who had worked as a long-term laborer for more than twenty years in the old society said, "Now, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries still want to bully us and try to make us suffer again. We cannot forget the enemy after harvesting the grain. We must stand in Dàhóng Village and see the whole of China, with a global perspective, procure more grain to support socialist construction and the world revolution." Some commune members said, "We are procuring 'political grain' and 'class grain.' Every grain expresses our love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and every grain is support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Preparing for war and famine is for our revolutionary people. The Communist warrior Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his precious life for the revolution. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must be selfless and overfulfill the state's procurement tasks."

Dàhóng Village, by using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work and emphasizing proletarian politics, completed the summer grain and oil procurement tasks ahead of schedule.

Currently, the village is educating the commune members on saving grain, helping them plan and save grain, and storing it properly. At the same time, they are actively engaged in summer sowing, determined to achieve new victories in agricultural production this year.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xīnghuǒ Brigade, Xīnghuǒ Commune, Beijing, are enthusiastically delivering procurement grain.

    用毛泽东思想统帅征购和分配工作
    大红村提前完成夏季粮油交售任务
    本报讯　一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥烈士的家乡——安徽省肥东县湖滨公社大红村的贫下中农，认真学习和执行毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，突出无产阶级政治，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅夏季分配和交售工作，六月十八日提前完成了粮油交售任务。
    今年，大红村夏季作物获得了历年来少有的丰收。小麦的总产量增长幅度很大，油料和其他作物也都获得了好收成。这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕果实。去年，正值小麦播种季节，久旱无雨。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派散布“靠天吃饭”的谬论，消磨社员的革命斗志。驻军某部就组织社员学习毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等伟大教导，树立“人定胜天”的思想。通过学习毛主席著作，社员们的革命精神更加振作，纷纷挖沟引水，抗旱保种，适时播种，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。后来，小麦急需追肥，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派又大刮经济主义妖风，煽动农民分公积金，使生产队无钱购买化肥。贫下中农识破了阶级敌人的鬼花招，一方面对敌人进行反击，一方面挖塘泥，送家肥，终于施足了肥料，保证了小麦丰收。贫下中农激动地说：“这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是文化大革命的丰硕成果。”“今年丰收的是‘政治’粮。”
    在粮食分配和夏季粮油征购过程中，由于无政府主义、个人主义思想的影响，有的人主张“分光分净”，“少交征购粮”。当地驻军、革命干部、贫下中农针对这种思想，作了专门讨论。大家认为夏季征购，是保证国家粮食供应，支援无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的一项重要政治任务。要搞好夏季交售和分配工作，必须加强领导，贯彻政策，组织社员活学活用毛主席著作，从全局出发，兼顾国家、集体、个人三方面的利益。
    他们组织社员利用讲用会等形式，以蔡永祥烈士为榜样，活学活用毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”、“照顾全局的观点”的教导。一个在旧社会打了二十多年长工的老贫农说：“眼下帝修反还想欺负我们，妄想叫咱贫下中农受二遍苦，我们不能收了粮食忘掉敌人。要站在大红村，看到全中国，胸怀全世界，多交征购粮，支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命。”有的社员说：“我们交的是‘政治粮’、‘阶级粮’，颗颗粮食，都表达了我们对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，粒粒粮食，都是对无产阶级文化大革命的支援。备战、备荒，就是为了我们革命人民。共产主义战士蔡永祥为革命献出宝贵的生命，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，要大公无私，超额完成国家征购任务。”
    大红村由于用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切工作，突出无产阶级政治，提前完成了夏季粮油交售任务。
    目前，这个村正对社员进行节约用粮的教育，帮助社员计划用粮，节约用粮，妥善储存。同时，他们积极进行夏种，决心夺取今年农业生产的新胜利。（附图片）
