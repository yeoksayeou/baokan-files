The Syrian people and military are maintaining high morale and vigilance, closely monitoring the activities of Israeli aggressor forces after the ceasefire, determined to deal a heavier blow to the enemy.

According to reports from Western news agencies, shortly after the United Nations announced that the ceasefire had taken effect, the anti-aircraft artillery units in the Syrian capital Damascus, which were ready for battle, drove away batch after batch of Israeli aggressor planes that were continuously diving down.

The people's armed forces are spirited, "guarding the sandbag fortifications on every street in Damascus, the defensive works around the capital, and the anti-aircraft guns."

After Syria announced its acceptance of the United Nations' ceasefire resolution at nine o'clock on the ninth, the Israeli aggressor forces brazenly launched fierce attacks on Syria on the ninth and tenth. On the eleventh, Syrian people and military discovered new enemy activities: Israeli tanks and armored vehicle units, under the cover of helicopters, were moving east and south from the Syrian city of Rafeed. That afternoon, the Syrian Ministry of Defense issued a statement calling on the Syrian military to fight to defend every inch of the motherland. The statement announced that the Syrian military was gathering on the second line of defense, ready for battle.

Inside the city of Quneitra, which the Israeli aggressor forces claimed to have occupied, the enemy forces were anxious, and the patrol units were repeatedly attacked by Syrian people and military. On the tenth, the heroic regular army and people's armed forces of Syria fought bravely, repelling the enemy's fierce attacks multiple times despite being outnumbered.

New China News Agency, June 13th: In protest of the heinous crimes committed by the United States and Britain in supporting Israel's aggression, oil workers in Arab countries have gone on strike, dealing a heavy blow to the interests of American and British imperialism.

The oil workers' strike in Libya has entered its eighth day by the twelfth. Due to the strike, oil production in Libya, which is mainly controlled by American monopolies, has completely stopped. The largest oil companies in Libya, Esso Standard Oil and Green Oasis Oil Company, have also closed their offices.

Oil workers in the occupied South Yemen have refused to supply oil to British army and air force bases for five consecutive days. It is reported that the large British military base in Aden has been forced to use reserve oil. The spokesman for the British Middle East Command admitted on the twelfth that due to the unity of the oil workers in Aden under the leadership of the National Liberation Front in South Yemen, a general strike is likely to erupt.

The Kuwait Trade Union Federation issued a statement on the twelfth, demanding that the Kuwaiti government sever ties with American and British imperialism, completely stop oil exports to the United States and Britain, and fully boycott American and British goods.

    据新华社十二日讯  叙利亚全国军民保持着高昂的斗志，百倍警惕地注视着以色列侵略军在“停火生效”后的战争活动，决心给敌人以更大的打击。
    据西方通讯社报道，联合国宣布“停火已经生效”以后不久，严阵以待的叙利亚首都大马士革的高射炮部队，又驱走了一批批不断俯冲的以色列强盗飞机。人民武装斗志高昂，他们“看管着大马士革每一条街上的沙袋工事、首都周围的防御工事和高射炮。”
    在叙利亚九日凌晨宣布接受联合国的“停火决议”后，以色列侵略军曾悍然在九日和十日连续两天向叙利亚发动了猖狂的进攻。十一日中午，叙利亚军民又警惕地发现敌人进行新的战争活动：以色列的坦克和装甲车队，在直升飞机掩护下，从叙利亚的拉费德城向东和向南移动。这天下午，叙利亚国防部发表的公报号召叙利亚军队要为保卫祖国的每一寸土地而战斗。公报宣布，叙利亚军队正在第二道防线上集结，严阵以待。
    在以色列侵略军声称已经侵占的库奈特腊城内，侵略军惶惶不安，巡逻部队不断遭到叙利亚军民的袭击。十日，英雄的叙利亚的正规军、人民武装浴血奋战，曾一次又一次击退了兵力占优势的敌人的猛攻。
    新华社十三日讯　为抗议美、英支持以色列发动侵略战争的滔天罪行，阿拉伯国家的石油工人纷纷举行罢工，使美英帝国主义的利益遭到沉重打击。
    利比亚石油工人举行的大罢工，到十二日已进入第八天。由于罢工的结果，主要由美国垄断资本控制的利比亚的石油生产已全部停顿，设在利比亚的最大的埃索美孚油公司和绿洲石油公司的营业处，也关了门。
    被占领的南也门的石油工人，已经连续五天坚决拒绝向英国陆军和空军基地供应石油。据报道，设在亚丁的英国大型军事基地已被迫不得不动用储备油。英军驻中东司令部发言人在十二日承认，由于亚丁石油工人在南也门民族解放阵线领导下团结一致，很可能爆发总罢工。
    科威特劳工联合会在十二日发表声明，要求科威特政府同美英帝国主义断交，全面停止向美英输送石油，并全部抵制美英货物。
