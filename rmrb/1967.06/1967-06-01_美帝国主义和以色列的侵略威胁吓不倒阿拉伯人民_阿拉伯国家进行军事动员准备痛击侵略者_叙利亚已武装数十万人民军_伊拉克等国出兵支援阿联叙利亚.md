The aggression threats of U.S. imperialism and Israel do not intimidate the Arab people. Arab countries are conducting military mobilizations to strike back against the aggressors. Syria has armed tens of thousands of people's militias with rifles and mortars, and has deployed regular armed forces along the Syrian-Israeli border.

In recent days, armed women's youth camps have been established in some provinces of Syria, and military training centers have been set up to train people in the use of weapons.

The Syrian Ministry of Education has issued a notice to students in primary and secondary schools stating that due to Syria's current situation of resisting imperialism and Israeli aggression, citizens have the duty to serve in the military to defend the motherland. Therefore, the examinations for this year's graduates and senior students who are currently serving in the military will be postponed until after their service.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 31st, in the face of the war threats from U.S. and British imperialism and their tool Israel, Arab countries and peoples are determined to fight side by side to strike back against the aggressors. So far, many Arab countries have sent troops or decided to send troops to the front lines of Syria and the United Arab Republic.

According to a report from the Baghdad Radio Station, Iraqi infantry, artillery, and tank units have already entered Syria and taken up positions on the front lines adjacent to Israel. Additionally, Iraqi units bound for the United Arab Republic began air transport today. Iraqi President Arif went to the Rashid Air Force Base near Baghdad to see them off.

The first batch of Kuwaiti troops was airlifted to Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic, on the 29th. A spokesperson for the Kuwaiti government said that the air transport of troops would continue.

According to a report in the Cairo *Al-Ahram* newspaper on the 30th, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic has accepted the Sudanese government's decision to send troops to the United Arab Republic. The Sudanese troops will soon arrive in the United Arab Republic.

The Algerian Ministry of Defense issued a statement on the 29th announcing that the Algerian government has decided to send troops to the Middle East to support Syria and the United Arab Republic in their counterattack against the aggressors.

The Moroccan government formally announced on the 30th that it has decided to place Moroccan armed forces under the command of the Arab Unified Command. Previously, Moroccan King Hassan had sent a special envoy to Cairo to negotiate with the United Arab Republic.

On the 30th, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic and King Hussein of Jordan signed a five-year joint defense agreement in Cairo, stipulating that if either country is subjected to any aggression, the two countries will take joint military action.

The Arab countries have scorned the war threats and intimidation of U.S. imperialism, quickly mobilizing to seriously counter them, leaving imperialism stunned and panicked. A report from the Deutsche Presse-Agentur on the 30th from Cairo stated: "The Arab countries have 'completed the encirclement of Israel,'" and "the danger to Israel has obviously greatly increased." The report also admitted in a dispirited tone: "The united strength of the Arab countries has never been as strong as it is today."

    据新华社大马士革三十日电　叙利亚准备反击美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列可能发动的新侵略，已经用步枪和迫击炮武装了数十万人民军，并集结正规的武装部队驻守叙利亚—以色列边境。
    在叙利亚的一些省最近还建立了武装的女青年营，增设了军事训练中心，来训练人们使用武器。
    叙利亚教育部向大中学校学生发出通知说，由于叙利亚正处于反对帝国主义和以色列侵略的形势之下，公民有义务服兵役来保卫祖国。因此，那些正在服兵役的应届毕业生和高年级学生的考试，将推迟到他们服役以后举行。
    据新华社三十一日讯在美、英帝国主义及其工具以色列的战争威胁面前，阿拉伯国家和人民决心并肩作战，打击侵略者。到目前为止，已经有许多阿拉伯国家派军队或决定派军队到叙利亚和阿联的前线去。
    据巴格达电台宣布，伊拉克步兵、炮兵和坦克部队已经开入叙利亚，进入与以色列接壤的前沿阵地。另外，前往阿联的伊拉克部队今天也开始空运。伊拉克总统阿里夫前往巴格达附近的拉希德空军基地送行。
    科威特的第一批部队已经在二十九日空运到阿联首都开罗。科威特政府发言人说，空运军队将继续进行。
    据开罗《金字塔报》三十日报道，阿联总统纳赛尔已经接受苏丹政府派军队到阿联去。苏丹军队很快就将到达阿联。
    阿尔及利亚国防部二十九日发表公报，宣布阿尔及利亚政府决定派军队到中东去，支援叙利亚和阿联反击侵略。
    摩洛哥政府三十日正式宣布，决定把摩洛哥武装部队交给阿拉伯联合司令部支配使用。在这以前，摩洛哥国王哈桑曾派特使到开罗与阿联商谈。
    阿联总统纳赛尔和约旦国王侯赛因三十日在开罗签订了一项为期五年的两国联合防御协定，规定两国任何一方遭到任何侵略时，两国将采取联合军事行动。
    阿拉伯国家藐视美帝国主义的战争恫吓和威胁，迅速动员起来认真加以对付，使帝国主义目瞪口呆和惊慌不安。德新社在三十日从开罗发出的一则消息说：阿拉伯国家已“完成了对以色列的包围圈”，“对以色列来说，危险显然已经大大增加了”。消息还沮丧地承认：“阿拉伯国家联合起来的力量从来没有象今天这样强大。”
