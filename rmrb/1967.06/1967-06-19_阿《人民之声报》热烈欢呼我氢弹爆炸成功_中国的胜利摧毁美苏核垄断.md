The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an editorial on June 18th, enthusiastically celebrating the successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb.

The article stated: At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, China has successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb. The fraternal Chinese people and all revolutionary forces around the world wholeheartedly celebrate this brilliant achievement under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong.

The article stated: The Albanian people regard the brilliant victory of the fraternal Chinese people as their own victory and sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, to achieve even greater brilliance.

The article stated: China's achievements have proven to the world the creative power of the people, the immense strength of self-reliance in building socialism, and the superiority of the socialist system.

The article stated: The reason the Chinese people have achieved such brilliant victories is due to the leadership of the proletarian political line and the great enthusiasm aroused among the people by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is sweeping the nation.

The article stated: The brilliant achievements of the 700 million fraternal Chinese people in the field of nuclear weapons, and the various victories achieved in the Cultural Revolution and on the international stage, are a devastating blow to the imperialist aggression plans and the malicious conspiracies of the Khrushchev revisionists. Recently, the U.S. imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionist clique have been desperately trying to establish a nuclear monopoly to pressure revolutionary peoples of various countries and to establish their hegemony over the world. However, their plots have been thoroughly foiled.

The article stated: China now has atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs. These are weapons in the hands of the revolutionary people who are striving to oppose the imperialist aggression plans and the conspiracies of modern revisionists. This is a great encouragement to the revolutionary peoples of various countries and a devastating blow to the collusion between imperialists and revisionists. The achievements of the Chinese people greatly encourage the peoples of various countries who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism with weapons in hand.

The article stated: China's successful nuclear tests are purely for defensive purposes. The Chinese people and the Chinese government have repeatedly stated that they will, as always, continue to work with all peace-loving peoples and countries around the world, strive together, and fight for the lofty goal of a complete ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

The article stated: The Albanian people believe that this new brilliant victory is another extremely great contribution to the strengthening of socialism, the revolution, and the cause of all progressive humanity. The victory achieved by the Chinese people will greatly enhance the confidence of the revolutionary forces of the world and will be beneficial to the great cause of the world proletariat, socialism, and communism.

The Albanian newspapers "People's Voice," "Unity," and "Warrior" all prominently published the full text of the news bulletin on the successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb on the front page on June 18th. The Albanian Central Radio Station broadcast the full text of the news bulletin on the evening of June 17th.

    阿《人民之声报》热烈欢呼我氢弹爆炸成功
    中国的胜利摧毁美苏核垄断
    据新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十八日发表编辑部文章，热烈欢呼我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功。
    文章说：中国在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻，成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹。兄弟的中国人民以及世界上一切的革命力量，都衷心地欢呼中国在以毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下所取得的这一辉煌成就。
    文章说：阿尔巴尼亚人民把兄弟的中国人民的辉煌胜利当作他们自己的胜利，并衷心祝愿兄弟的中国人民在英明的导师毛主席的领导下，取得更加辉煌的新成就。
    文章说：中国所取得的成就，向全世界证明了人民的创造才能，自力更生地建设社会主义的无比威力和社会主义制度的优越性。
    文章说：中国人民所以能取得这样辉煌的胜利，是由于无产阶级政治挂帅，是由于正在全国胜利展开的无产阶级文化大革命在人民中激发了无比的热情。
    文章说：七亿兄弟的中国人民在核武器方面所取得的辉煌成就，在文化大革命中以及在国际舞台上所取得的种种胜利，是对帝国主义的侵略计划，对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的恶毒阴谋的毁灭性打击。美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团近来拚命企图建立核垄断，以便用来对各国革命人民施加压力，并建立它们主宰世界的霸权。但是它们的阴谋已经遭到了彻底破产。
    文章说：中国有了原子弹，有了导弹，现在又有了氢弹。这是掌握在全力以赴地为反对帝国主义的侵略计划、为反对现代修正主义者的阴谋而斗争的革命人民手中的武器。这是对各国革命人民的巨大鼓舞，对帝修勾结的毁灭性的打击。中国人民的这一成就，大大地鼓舞了手拿武器进行反帝反殖斗争的各国人民。
    文章说：中国的各次成功的核试验，完全是为了防御的。中国人民和中国政府一再重申，将一如既往地继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家，共同努力，坚持斗争，为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而奋斗。
    文章说：阿尔巴尼亚人民认为这一新的光辉胜利，是对加强社会主义、革命和整个进步人类事业的又一个非常伟大的贡献。中国人民所取得的这一胜利必将增强世界革命力量的信心，并有利于世界无产阶级、社会主义和共产主义伟大事业的胜利。
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》《团结报》和《战士报》，十八日都在头版显著地位全文刊登了我国成功地爆炸第一颗氢弹的新闻公报。阿尔巴尼亚中央广播电台十七日晚全文广播了这一新闻公报。
