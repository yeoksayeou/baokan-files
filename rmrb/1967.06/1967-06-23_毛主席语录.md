History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is detached from the people) the people are reduced to mere dregs, while the stage is dominated by gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being corrected by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, old dramas have a new look, and this is indeed worth celebrating.

    毛主席语录
    历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。
