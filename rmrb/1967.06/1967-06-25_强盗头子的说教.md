Title: The Bandit Chief's Sermon

The bandit chief of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, delivered a speech on the Middle East issue on the 19th. After throwing out his arrogant "five principles" to force the Arab people to surrender completely, he said the following nonsense: "Now is not the time to vent hatred, but the time to be magnanimous; not the time for propaganda, but the time for patience; not the time for abuse, but the time for a broad vision."

Here, Johnson is trying his best to act as if he has nothing to do with the Middle East war. This is utterly shameless. Who ignited the flames of aggression in the Middle East? Who launched a large-scale armed attack on the Arab countries? Who unleashed the Israeli dog to pounce on the Arab people? It was U.S. imperialism, it was you, Johnson. You, the chief culprit with the blood of the Arab people on your hands, actually want to portray yourself as a mediator. Don't you think this is too out of character?

Johnson's pastoral sermons are all deceitful. U.S. imperialism has never shown any "magnanimity" towards oppressed peoples and nations. All it has done is to plunder and exploit, to rob openly, to invade shamelessly, to scheme treacherously, and to oppress brutally. It wants to devour the world's peoples whole, leaving not a single bone, so where is there any kindness or humility?

Now, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, Israel has launched an armed invasion, occupying Arab lands, and together with the Soviet revisionists, is forcing Arab countries to accept the humiliating "ceasefire." Johnson is talking about "magnanimity." What does this mean? It means that no matter how the Arab people are invaded and bullied, they should not resist or harbor resentment, but should only swallow their anger, bow their heads, and obediently accept the slavery and butchery of U.S. imperialism. Isn't this "the officials can set fires, but the common people can't even light lamps"?

The Soviet revisionists also regard Johnson's sermons as gospel and actively peddle them. The "restraint," "Tashkent spirit," and "peaceful coexistence" advocated by the Soviet revisionists are all the same stuff as Johnson's. The Soviet revisionists sing the same tune as Johnson precisely to help U.S. imperialism deceive the world's peoples and sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations.

However, how can the Arab people and the world's people believe the nonsense of Johnson and the Soviet revisionists? The Arab people, who have learned from bitter experience, harbor deep hatred towards imperialism. They must curse and hate the enemy, resist and fight back. It is precisely because U.S. imperialism is extremely afraid of the awakening of the 100 million Arab people that, after using force, it resorts to the pastor's deceitful incantations to try to bind people. But the Arab people will not be fooled. They deeply understand that the imperialist reactionaries are a bunch of ferocious beasts. In front of beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice. Whether you provoke it or not, it will still eat you. The Arab people are determined, together with all the peoples of the world, to engage in a head-on struggle with U.S. imperialism until this man-eating beast is killed.

### 强盗头子的说教

    强盗头子的说教
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊，十九日发表了一篇关于中东问题的演说。他在抛出了逼迫阿拉伯人民全面屈服的狂妄的“五项原则”之后，说了这样一番鬼话：“现在不是发泄怨恨的时候，而是需要宽宏大量的时候；不是进行宣传的时候，而是表现耐心的时候；不是进行谩骂的时候，而是需要有远大目光的时候。”
    在这里，约翰逊极力装作他同中东战争毫不相干的样子。这真是无耻之尤。是谁在中东点起侵略的战火？是谁对阿拉伯国家发动大规模武装进攻？是谁放出以色列这条恶犬向阿拉伯人民猛扑过来？就是美帝国主义，就是你约翰逊。你这个双手沾满阿拉伯人民鲜血的罪魁祸首，居然想把自己打扮成和事老的模样，难道不觉得太不合身份了吗？
    约翰逊的牧师式的说教，完全是欺人之谈。美帝国主义对被压迫人民和被压迫民族从来就没有什么“宽宏大量”，有的只是敲骨吸髓的掠夺，是明火执仗的抢劫，是厚颜无耻的侵略，是阴险毒辣的诡计，是残暴野蛮的压迫。它恨不得把世界人民一口吞噬，连骨头都不吐一根，哪里会有什么温良恭俭让？
    现在，在美帝国主义指使以色列发动武装侵略，侵占了阿拉伯国家的土地，又伙同苏修集团逼迫阿拉伯国家接受屈辱的“停火”的情况下，约翰逊大讲其“宽宏大量”，这是什么意思呢？这就是说，阿拉伯人民不管怎样遭到侵略，受到欺侮，也不要反抗，不要怨恨，而只能忍气吞声，俯首贴耳，乖乖地去接受美帝国主义的奴役和宰割。这不是“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”吗？
    对于约翰逊的这一套说教，苏修集团同样是奉为信条，并积极加以贩卖的。苏修集团鼓吹的什么“克制”，什么“塔什干精神”，什么“和平共处”，也就是约翰逊的那一套货色。苏修集团之所以和约翰逊唱一个调子，就是为了帮助美帝国主义来麻痹世界人民，破坏被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。
    但是，阿拉伯人民和世界人民怎么能够听信约翰逊和苏修集团的那套鬼话呢？有着血的教训的阿拉伯人民对帝国主义充满着仇恨，他们对敌人就是要骂、要恨，要反抗、要斗争。正是因为美帝国主义万分恐惧一亿阿拉伯人民的觉醒，所以在使用武力之后，它又拿出牧师的那一套骗人的咒语来妄图束缚人。但是，阿拉伯人民是不会上当的。他们深深懂得，帝国主义反动派是一群凶残的野兽。在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。你刺激它也是那样，不刺激它也是那样，总之是要吃人的。阿拉伯人民决心与全世界人民一起，与美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，直到把这只吃人的野兽打死为止。
