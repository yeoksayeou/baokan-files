As the great wave of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat surges forward, Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and "practice frugality to make revolution" is increasingly resonating in the hearts of the people. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of China are, with boundless enthusiasm, launching a new upsurge of grasping revolution, promoting production, opposing waste, and practicing frugality. The situation in China's industrial and agricultural production is as good as the revolutionary situation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Run factories, shops, and all state-owned and cooperative enterprises frugally. Run all other enterprises frugally. Everything should follow the principle of frugality. This is the principle of saving, and saving is one of the basic principles of the socialist economy."

Currently, we should repeatedly and deeply propagate Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of self-reliance, striving for progress, hard work, and frugal construction of the country. We should vigorously propagate and implement this basic principle of socialist construction.

For a long time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have, within their reach, promoted counter-revolutionary economism and pursued the revisionist line, resisting and destroying Chairman Mao's policy of frugal construction. In economic construction and enterprise management, they have promoted material incentives and profit-seeking; in life, they have built grand halls and residences, squandering and wasting. They use this bourgeois approach to attempt to transform our country, corrupt our young generation, and carry out "peaceful evolution" to restore capitalism.

Frugality and wastefulness are a reflection of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is a manifestation of the fundamental opposition between the worldview of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Practicing frugality is not only an economic issue but also a major political issue.

This year is the second year of China's third five-year plan and a year of nationwide class struggle. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from other countries have never given up their dream of subverting our proletarian dictatorship and destroying our socialist economic construction. Domestic class enemies also do not accept their failure and are using various insidious means to sabotage our economic development. We must understand Chairman Mao's wise instruction to "practice frugality to make revolution" in connection with the overall situation of the class struggle at home and abroad. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people."

At present, we must clearly see that the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and the phenomenon of wastefulness in economic construction have not been thoroughly criticized and eliminated. Some comrades still do not fully understand the great political significance of Chairman Mao's call to "practice frugality to make revolution." Some enterprises and units do not pay attention to saving coal, steel, wood, electricity, petroleum, and other raw materials for the state, and do not try every means to utilize waste materials. Some units are extravagant in financial expenditure, issuing vouchers and paying money at will. Some units often hold meetings during production and work hours, with many off-duty personnel and lax labor discipline. Some mass organizations, in order to fight "internal wars," have one unit with three broadcast cars and another with five; one unit's loudspeaker is louder, and another's is even louder, affecting production, study, and rest. These comrades lack a sense of the masses, a sense of frugality, and proletarian class feelings.

More than thirty years ago, Chairman Mao said: "Financial expenditure should follow the principle of saving. All government officials should understand that embezzlement and waste are serious crimes.... Saving every penny for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system. We should strictly distinguish our methods of using state income from those of the Kuomintang." This instruction is completely applicable to the current situation. We must use the proletarian viewpoint and the methods used by Chairman Mao and our Party to deal with the issue of financial expenditure, and we must not use the bourgeois viewpoint and the methods of the Kuomintang to deal with the issue of financial expenditure.

When the revolutionary organizations of the proletariat were in a suppressed position in the past, they made revolution with hard work and simplicity, winning the support and sympathy of the broad masses and tempering themselves. Now that their position has changed and they have power, seals, and money in their hands, can they continue to maintain the style of hard work, simplicity, and frugality, and implement Chairman Mao's policy of "frugal construction" and instruction of "practicing frugality" in everything and every matter? This is a severe test. It is a big issue of whether to be a thorough revolutionary or a corrupt and degenerate person. We must not take it lightly.

We must always remember that material wealth is created by workers and peasants, and every penny is earned by the laboring people with their hard work and sweat.

We must understand that frugal construction and practicing frugality to make revolution are major issues of anti-revisionism, preventing revisionism, and preventing the restoration of capitalism. They are major issues of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions of our Party, cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, accelerating socialist construction, strengthening war preparedness, and supporting world revolution.

Comprehensively and persistently implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction to "practice frugality to make revolution" is a serious struggle and a arduous task. It is also an important content of the struggle, criticism, and reform of various regions and units.

From the central departments to the localities, to every grassroots unit, we must attach great importance to this. All revolutionary committees, military regions, the People's Liberation Army undertaking the three supports and two militaries tasks, and all revolutionary mass organizations must focus on the issue of practicing frugality to make revolution, place it on their important agenda, and complete it as a political task.

We must mobilize the masses to participate in supervision. The broad masses are on the front line of production and struggle, and they know best where there is waste and where savings can be made. They understand best how precious every brick, every tile, every piece of iron, and every piece of wood is. We must let the broad masses keep watch and supervise financial expenditure. Those who violate financial systems and embezzle state and collective property must be seriously dealt with, and the property must be recovered or compensated for at the original price. Those with serious offenses must also be given appropriate punishments, even legal penalties.

    三论节约闹革命
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的伟大浪潮向前推进，毛主席“抓革命，促生产”，“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召不断深入人心。我国亿万革命人民，在中国人民解放军强有力的支援下，正以冲天的干劲，掀起一个抓革命，促生产，反对浪费，厉行节约的新高潮。我国工农业生产的形势，同革命形势一样，一片大好。
    毛主席教导我们：“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。这就是节约的原则，节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。”
    当前，我们应该向全国革命人民反复地、深入地宣传毛主席的自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的光辉思想，大力宣传和贯彻执行我国社会主义建设的这一基本原则。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，长期以来，在他们力所能及的地方，大搞反革命经济主义，推行修正主义路线，抵制和破坏毛主席的勤俭建国的方针。他们在经济建设和企业管理上，大搞物质刺激，利润挂帅；在生活上，大建堂院楼舍，大肆挥霍浪费。他们就是用资产阶级的这一套，妄图改造我们的国家，腐蚀我们年轻的一代，实行“和平演变”，复辟资本主义。
    勤俭节约和铺张浪费，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一种反映，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观根本对立的表现。厉行节约不仅是个经济问题，而且是个重大的政治问题。
    今年是我国第三个五年计划的第二年，是全国全面开展阶级斗争的一年。国外的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派从来没有放弃颠覆我国无产阶级专政、破坏我国社会主义经济建设的梦想，国内的阶级敌人也决不甘心自己的失败，正在以各种阴险的手段破坏我们经济的发展。我们必须联系国内外阶级斗争的总形势，来理解毛主席“要节约闹革命”的英明指示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针。
    目前，必须清醒地看到，在经济建设方面的资产阶级反动路线和铺张浪费的现象，并没有彻底批判和肃清。我们一些同志，对于毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召的重大政治意义，仍然认识不足。有些企业、单位，不注意为国家节约煤炭、钢材、木材、电力、石油等等原材料，不想方设法利用废旧物资。有些单位，在财政开支方面，大手大脚，随意开条子，支钞票。有些单位，经常在生产和工作时间开大会，脱产人员多，劳动纪律松弛。有些群众组织，为了打“内战”，你搞三辆广播车，我搞五辆广播车；你的喇叭声音高，我比你的还要高，影响生产，影响学习，影响休息。这些同志，缺乏群众观念，缺乏节约观念，缺乏无产阶级的阶级感情。
    毛主席在三十多年前讲过一段话：“财政的支出，应该根据节省的方针。应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。……节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。我们对于国家收入的使用方法，应该和国民党的方法有严格的区别。”这一指示，完全适用于当前的情况。我们必须用无产阶级的观点，用毛主席和我们党历来使用的方法，来对待财政开支的问题，而决不能用资产阶级的观点，用国民党的方法来对待财政开支的问题。
    无产阶级革命派的组织，在过去处于被压制地位的时候，艰苦朴素闹革命，赢得了广大群众的支持和同情，也锻炼了自己。现在地位改变了，手中有权、有印、有钱了。在这种情况下，能不能继续保持艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的作风，事事、处处贯彻执行毛主席“勤俭建国”的方针和“厉行节约”的指示，是一场严峻的考验。这是做一个彻底的革命者，还是做一个腐化堕落分子的大问题。切切不可等闲视之。
    我们一定要时刻牢记，物质财富是工人、农民创造的，每一分钱都是劳动人民用辛勤的劳动和汗水换来的。
    我们一定要懂得，勤俭建国，节约闹革命，是反修、防修、防止资本主义复辟的大事，是继承和发扬我们党的优良传统的大事，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大事，是加速社会主义建设的大事，是加强战备的大事，是支援世界革命的大事。
    全面地、持久地贯彻“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，是一场严重的斗争，是一项艰巨的任务，也是各地区、各单位进行斗批改的一个重要内容。
    从中央各部门到地方，到每一个基层单位，都要高度重视起来。各革命委员会，各军区，担负三支二军任务的解放军，各革命群众组织，都要抓节约闹革命的问题，把它放到自己的重要议事日程上来，当作一项政治任务来完成。
    要发动群众参加监督。广大群众处在生产和斗争的第一线，他们最了解哪里有浪费，哪里可以节约。他们最懂得一砖一瓦、一铁一木，来之不易。要让广大群众把关，监督财政开支。对于破坏财政制度，侵占国家财产、集体财产的，都必须严肃处理，必须追回或按价赔偿，对情节严重者，还要给以应得的处分，甚至法律制裁。
