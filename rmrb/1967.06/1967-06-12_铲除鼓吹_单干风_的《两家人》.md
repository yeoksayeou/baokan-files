Title: Uprooting the Advocacy of "Individual Farming" in "Two Families"

The reactionary film "Two Families" is a poisonous weed that defames poor and lower-middle peasants, erases the sharp class struggle in the agricultural collectivization movement, and attempts to restore capitalism.

The film's backdrop is 1953. At that time, the Party Central Committee in the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" pointed out that by the winter of 1953 to the autumn harvest of 1954, agricultural cooperatives should increase from 14,000 to 35,800, that is, only an increase of one and a half times. However, that year, they increased to 100,000, an increase of more than seven times. This ironclad fact fully demonstrates the broad masses of peasants' enthusiastic support for the Party-led agricultural collectivization movement and shows their high initiative in taking the socialist road. Yet, the situation depicted in the film is exactly the opposite. When the news of establishing agricultural cooperatives came, it was as if a great disaster had struck, causing chaos. The "old poor peasant" Gao Zhengguo heard this news in the town and rushed home as if his house was on fire, almost knocking over a small stall in front of the bank. Upon returning home, when he asked his daughter Erzhu about the agricultural cooperative starting from their mutual aid group, he flew into a rage, saying, "Left and right, they are picking on me!" The film uses these scenes to vigorously promote the fallacy of the "capitalist-roaders in power within the Party" that "collectivization exceeded actual possibilities and the level of consciousness of the masses," maliciously slandering the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The film also glorifies the "three horses, one plow, one cart" style of rich peasant economy, which the "capitalist-roaders in power within the Party" vigorously advocate, blatantly singing the praises of "individual farming is good." Look, in the film, Gao Zhengguo does not participate in the collective labor of the mutual aid group and relies on his own individual farming. As a result, he has pigs in the pen, chickens in the basket, grain in the barn, and money in the drawer, eventually buying the four acres of good land from the old poor peasant Li Cun. But what about those who take the path of collectivization? Almost all of them "borrow" grain from Gao Zhengguo. The film's intention is extremely malicious, aiming to promote the idea that "collectivization is not as good as individual farming" and "socialism is not as superior to capitalism." It tells people: to become wealthy, one must follow Gao Zhengguo's path, without collective effort, without revolution, without socialism, and without the Party's leadership. The film "Two Families" is madly inciting the restoration of capitalism!

The film's release in 1963 was not accidental. At that time, international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries joined forces to oppose China, and domestic class enemies also emerged one after another. A small group of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, along with them, stirred up a black wind of ferocious attacks on the Party and socialism. The "capitalist-roader in power within the Party" vigorously advocated "three reconciliations and one reduction," relentlessly promoting the theory of "class struggle extinction," advocating class cooperation, and abolishing class struggle. "Two Families" was produced based on the reactionary theory of the "capitalist-roader in power within the Party" to collaborate with the class enemies' ferocious attacks on socialism at that time.

The slanders and attacks by the "capitalist-roader in power within the Party" and all reactionaries on our socialist system are merely a few flies buzzing, causing no harm to the great glory of our Party. We warn the "capitalist-roader in power within the Party" that we will not let you off, and we will definitely throw you and your capitalist blowhards into the trash heap of history, along with the poisonous weeds you have created!

    铲除鼓吹“单干风”的《两家人》
    长旭　志庆　同战
    反动影片《两家人》是一棵丑化贫下中农、抹杀农业合作化运动中尖锐的阶级斗争、妄图复辟资本主义的大毒草。
    影片的背景是一九五三年。当时党中央在《关于发展农业生产合作社的决议》中指出，要在一九五三年冬季到一九五四年秋收的时候，农业合作社由一万四千多个发展到三万五千八百多个，即只准备增加一倍半。结果，这一年却发展到了十万个，即增加七倍多。这一铁的事实，充分说明广大农民热烈拥护党领导的农业合作化运动，表现了走社会主义道路的高度积极性。可是影片中描写的情形却恰好相反。当成立农业合作社的消息传来时，好象大祸临头，混乱不堪。“老贫农”高正国在集镇上听说这个消息就象家里着了火一样，赶紧向家跑，差点把银行门前的小摊撞翻。到家后，一问女儿二珠，说农业合作社要先从他们这个互助组办起，他便大发雷霆，说什么：“左一下，右一下，跟我过不去！”影片通过这些场面，大肆宣扬党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“合作化是超过了实际可能，超过了群众觉悟水平”的谬论，恶毒地诬蔑贫下中农。
    影片还把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大肆鼓吹的发展“三马一犁一车”式的富农经济极力加以美化，明目张胆地歌颂“单干好”。请看，影片中的高正国不参加互助组集体劳动，靠自己单干，结果是猪满圈、鸡满笼、粮满仓、钱满柜，最后买下了老贫农李存的四亩好地。可是走合作化道路的人又是怎样的情况呢？几乎都向高正国“借”粮食。影片这样写，用意十分恶毒，目的就是宣扬“合作化不如单干好”，“社会主义不如资本主义‘优越’”。它告诉人们：要想富裕，必须走高正国的路，不要集体，不要革命，不要社会主义，不要党的领导，影片《两家人》在疯狂地煽动复辟资本主义！
    影片出笼于一九六三年决不是偶然的。这时，国际上帝、修、反联合反华，国内的阶级敌人也纷纷出笼，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和它们一唱一和，煽起了一股向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的黑风。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派则极力鼓吹“三和一少”、“三自一包”，竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，主张阶级合作，取消阶级斗争。《两家人》正是根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这种反动理论，为了配合当时阶级敌人向社会主义的猖狂进攻炮制出来的。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和一切反动派对我们社会主义制度的诬蔑和攻击，只不过是几个苍蝇嗡嗡叫而已，丝毫也无损于我们党的伟大光辉。正告党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，我们一定不会放过你们，一定要把你们炮制出来的大毒草连同你们这伙资本主义的吹鼓手一起扔进历史的垃圾堆！
