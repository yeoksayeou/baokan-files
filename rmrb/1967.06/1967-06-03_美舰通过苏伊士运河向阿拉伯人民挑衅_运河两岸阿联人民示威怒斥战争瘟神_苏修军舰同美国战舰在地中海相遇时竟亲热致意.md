The U.S. aircraft carrier "Enterprise" passed through the Suez Canal on June 3. Angry Egyptian people held demonstrations on both sides of the canal, shouting slogans and protesting against and condemning U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, for their plots to invade Arab countries.

Fearful of the people, this U.S. warship, originally in the Mediterranean Sea, dared not enter the Suez Canal during the day but sneaked into Port Said in the middle of the night. However, as soon as it entered Port Said, Egyptian port workers held an anti-U.S. demonstration. The workers stood on small boats on both sides of the U.S. warship, shouting slogans such as "Down with Johnson!" From Port Said to the southern end of the Suez Canal in Suez City, along the 175-kilometer-long canal, the indignant Egyptian people shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with the Israeli aggressors!" "Victory will be ours!" Some demonstrators even angrily threw their shoes at the American soldiers on the ship.

In the face of the Egyptian people's just protest slogans, the crew of the U.S. aircraft carrier were so frightened that they hid in the cabins and dared not come out.

In contrast to the angry anti-U.S. demonstrations held by the Egyptian people, when a Soviet destroyer encountered the U.S. Sixth Fleet's aircraft carrier "America" in the Mediterranean last week, the two sides behaved very amicably. The "America" had sailed to the waters near Israel to threaten the Arab people. The Associated Press reported that the Soviet destroyer and the U.S. aircraft carrier sailed side by side, "Our people waved and took pictures, and they waved back and smiled, also taking pictures."

Just as the people of the Arab countries were united in their indignation and jointly condemned U.S. imperialism's support for Israel's aggression, the Soviet destroyer adopted such a friendly attitude towards the U.S. imperialist warship used to threaten the Arab people, once again exposing the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

    美舰通过苏伊士运河向阿拉伯人民挑衅
    运河两岸阿联人民示威怒斥战争瘟神
    苏修军舰同美国战舰在地中海相遇时竟亲热致意
    新华社开罗一日电  当美国航空母舰“勇猛号”一日通过苏伊士运河时，愤怒的阿联人民在这条运河的两岸举行示威，高呼口号，抗议和谴责美帝国主义和它的侵略工具以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略阴谋。
    由于害怕人民，这艘原在地中海的美国军舰不敢在白天驶进苏伊士运河，而在半夜以后偷偷摸摸地进入塞得港。但是，它一进入塞得港，阿联港口工人就举行了反美示威。工人们站在小艇上，在这条美国军舰的两旁，高呼：“打倒约翰逊！”等口号。从塞得港起至苏伊士运河南端的苏伊士港，全长一百七十五公里的运河的两岸，义愤填膺的阿联人民高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒以色列侵略者！”“胜利属于我们！”等口号。有的示威群众还愤怒地把鞋子向舰上的美国兵扔去。
    在阿联人民正义的抗议口号声中，这艘美国航空母舰的官兵吓得躲进舱中，不敢露面。
    另据报道，和阿联人民举行的这个愤怒反美示威形成鲜明对照的是：当一艘苏修驱逐舰上星期在地中海和美国第六舰队的航空母舰“美利坚号”相遇时，双方表现得十分亲热。“美利坚号”是开到以色列附近的海面，对阿拉伯人民进行恐吓的。美联社说，那艘苏联驱逐舰和美国航空母舰靠近排列航行，“我们的人挥手并照像，他们的人笑着挥手作答，并且也拍照。”
    正当阿拉伯各国人民同仇敌忾，共同声讨美帝国主义支持以色列的侵略阴谋的时候，苏修军舰竟然对美帝国主义用来恐吓阿拉伯人民的军舰采取这种亲热态度，又一次暴露了苏修领导集团作为美帝头号帮凶的丑恶面目。
