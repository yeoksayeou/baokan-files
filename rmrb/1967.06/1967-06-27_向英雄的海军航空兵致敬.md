In the midst of the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and just ten days after the joyous news of the successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb, a thrilling report came from the front lines of the South China Sea. On June 26, a certain unit of the heroic Chinese naval air force shot down an American F-4C fighter jet that had intruded into Chinese airspace in an act of war provocation in the skies over the southeastern region of Hainan Island.

This glorious victory is the fruit of the naval air force's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, of their efforts to promote revolution and strengthen preparedness for war. It is a victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

With revolutionary fervor, we pay tribute to the heroic naval air force that defends our sacred airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We enthusiastically cheer, comrades, you fought bravely and tenaciously, you fought well! Well done!!

This victory is a powerful support for the heroic people of Vietnam, the Arab people, and all revolutionary people around the world. It is a great encouragement to our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon who are engaged in the struggle against British oppression. It is also a heavy blow to the arch-enemy of the Chinese people—the American imperialists and their running dogs!

Seventeen years ago today, American imperialism brazenly occupied our territory of Taiwan. For seventeen years, the American bandits have vigorously supported the Chiang clique, savagely oppressed our compatriots in Taiwan, instigated the Chiang bandits to send spies to harass and sabotage our mainland, and invaded our airspace and territorial waters hundreds of times with their aircraft and warships, killing our innocent coastal fishermen and accumulating a mountain of blood debts. Since the start of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, American imperialism has become even more hostile towards our people, repeatedly provoking us with serious challenges. We will surely settle these old and new accounts.

Recently, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin went to the United States to hold secret talks with the American imperialist leader Johnson, tightening their global collusion and hastening the formation of an anti-revolutionary alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Just as the talks between the American and Soviet leaders concluded, the Americans immediately dispatched aircraft to provoke us, which is certainly not a mere coincidence.

We sternly warn the American bandits: the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with! The lifespan of American imperialism will not be long. No matter how hard the Soviet revisionist clique tries, they cannot save you. In the face of the great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, if the American bandits dare to continue their aggression, they will be annihilated, coming in but never returning!

    向英雄的海军航空兵致敬	本报评论员
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，在我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的大喜讯传出刚刚十天之后，从祖国南海前线，又传来令人振奋的捷报。六月二十六日，英雄的海军航空兵某部，在海南岛东南地区上空，击落侵入我国领空进行战争挑衅的美国F—4C型战斗机一架。
    这一辉煌战绩，是我海军航空兵部队在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命、促战备的成果，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们满怀革命的激情，向保卫祖国神圣的领空、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的英雄的海军航空兵致敬！我们热烈欢呼，战友们，你们打得勇猛顽强，打得好！打得好！！
    这次胜利，是对英雄的越南人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界一切革命人民的有力支援，是对正在进行着反英抗暴斗争的我港九爱国同胞的极大鼓舞，也是对中国人民的死敌——美帝国主义及其帮凶的沉重打击！
    十七年前的今天，美帝国主义悍然霸占我领土台湾。十七年来，美国强盗极力扶植蒋帮，疯狂蹂躏我台湾同胞，唆使蒋匪派遣特务对我大陆进行骚扰破坏，美国飞机军舰数百次侵犯我领空领海，杀害我沿海无辜渔民，欠下了累累血债。我国无产阶级文化大革命以来，美帝国主义更加仇视我国人民，一次又一次对我进行严重挑衅。这一笔又一笔旧债新账，我们是一定要清算的。
    最近，苏修头目柯西金到美国去同美帝国主义头子约翰逊举行密谈，进行全球性大勾结，加紧拼凑美苏反革命联盟。在美苏头目会谈刚刚结束，美帝就马上派出飞机对我国进行挑衅，这绝不是偶然的巧合。
    我们严正警告美国强盗：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的！美帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。苏修集团不管怎样效劳，也救不了你们的命。在伟大的中国人民和中国人民解放军面前，美国强盗胆敢继续来犯，就叫他们粉身碎骨，有来无回！
