Seven years have passed since the Japanese national heroine Kani Mitsuko bravely sacrificed her life. She was brutally murdered by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries during a demonstration against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Today, Japan is still under the rule of wolves, while a handful of Japanese Communist Party revisionists are acting like cowardly foxes seeking a quiet life. At this time, people naturally remember this warrior who dedicated her life to the cause of Japanese national liberation.

At that time, our great leader Chairman Mao had praised the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. Chairman Mao pointed out: The Japanese people have found a good way, under the current circumstances, to oppose the new "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," oppose U.S. military bases, and drive out the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression. This is to unite all forces, except for the U.S. imperialists and their agents, as broadly as possible, and to wage a nationwide mass struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their agents.

Kani Mitsuko was a brave fighter in this mass struggle. Chairman Mao gave a high evaluation of Kani Mitsuko's martyrdom, saying: Kani Mitsuko has become a world-renowned Japanese national heroine.

Although Kani Mitsuko was murdered by the Japanese reactionaries, she still lives in the hearts of the Japanese people. What is outrageous is that a handful of Japanese Communist Party revisionists, in order to deceive the Japanese people, deliberately distort the facts and repeatedly spread rumors, shamelessly defaming this national heroine as a "Trotskyite."

Now it is proven that the slander of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists has exposed their own cowardly souls, fearing to engage in a head-on struggle with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. They attempt to use the attack on Kani Mitsuko to restrain and obstruct the struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

Modern revisionists themselves fear revolution and do not allow others to revolt. They all have a shameless trick: whoever insists on revolutionary principles and dares to revolt, they label as a "Trotskyite," turning revolutionaries into "counter-revolutionaries." The Khrushchev revisionists are like this, and so are the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. However, their tricks cannot deceive people, nor can they intimidate revolutionaries. In fact, those who inherit the legacy of Trotsky and conspire with today's Trotskyites are not others, but precisely those modern revisionists who fear revolution, abandon revolution, and then oppose revolution, precisely the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and their lackeys.

In Japan, for every Kani Mitsuko who falls, thousands and tens of thousands of Kani Mitsukos have stood up. The Japanese Communist Party revisionists have discarded the revolutionary banner, and the true revolutionaries of Japan will hold this banner even higher. The Japanese national heroine Kani Mitsuko will be remembered forever, while the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, these traitors, will only leave a stench for eternity.

    诽谤沾污不了战士的荣誉
    日本的民族英雄桦美智子英勇牺牲，已经七年了。她是在七年前一次反对日美军事同盟条约的示威斗争中，惨遭美日反动派杀害的。今天日本仍然豺狼当道，而一小撮日共修正主义分子却竟作苟安的狐鼠。在这个时候，人们自然会更加怀念这位为日本民族解放事业而英勇献身的战士。
    当年，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就曾经赞扬了日本人民的反美爱国斗争。毛主席指出：日本人民已经找到了一个在目前情况下反对新的“日美安全保障条约”、反对美国军事基地、赶走美帝国主义侵略势力的好办法，这就是团结一切除了美帝国主义及其代理人以外的最广泛的力量，对美帝国主义及其代理人进行全民性的群众斗争。
    桦美智子就是在这个群众斗争中一名勇敢的闯将。毛主席对桦美智子的殉难，给予了高度的评价，他说：桦美智子已成全世界闻名的日本民族英雄。
    桦美智子虽然遭到了日本反动派的杀害，但是她仍然活在日本人民的心里。而令人愤慨的是，一小撮日共修正主义分子，为了欺骗日本人民，却故意歪曲事实真相，一再散布流言蜚语，无耻地诬蔑这位民族英雄为“托派分子”。
    现在证明，日共修正主义分子的这种诽谤，恰恰暴露了他们自己害怕同美日反动派进行针锋相对斗争的卑怯的灵魂。他们妄图利用对桦美智子的攻击，来束缚和阻挡日本广大人民反对美日反动派的斗争。
    现代修正主义者自己害怕革命，又不许别人革命。他们都有一个无耻的伎俩，这就是：谁坚持革命的原则，敢于革命，就给谁扣上“托洛茨基主义”的帽子，把革命者打成“反革命”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是这样，日共修正主义分子也是这样。但是，他们这种伎俩骗不了人，更吓不倒革命者。事实上，继承托洛茨基的衣钵，同今天的托洛茨基分子同流合污的，不是别人，正是那些从害怕革命、放弃革命进而反对革命的现代修正主义者自己，正是苏修领导集团以及他们的娄罗门徒。
    在日本，一个桦美智子倒下去，千千万万个桦美智子已经站起来。日共修正主义分子抛掉了革命的旗帜，日本的真正革命派就要把这面旗帜更高地举起来。日本民族英雄桦美智子将流芳百世，而日共修正主义分子这些叛徒们则只能落得个遗臭万年。
