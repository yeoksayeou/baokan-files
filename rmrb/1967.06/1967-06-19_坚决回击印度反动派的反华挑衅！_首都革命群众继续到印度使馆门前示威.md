	Resolutely Counterattack the Indian Reactionaries' Anti-China Provocations!
	Capital Revolutionary Masses Continue to Demonstrate in Front of the Indian Embassy

	New China News Agency, June 18th: The revolutionary masses of the capital continued to demonstrate in front of the Indian Embassy today, strongly protesting against the Indian reactionary government's rampant anti-China activities.

	Thousands upon thousands of revolutionary masses and Red Guards from the capital gathered in front of the Indian Embassy, posting big-character posters, writing protest slogans, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, and loudly shouting: "The Chinese people are not to be insulted!" "Anti-China activities will not end well!" "Resolutely counterattack the Indian reactionaries' anti-China provocations!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" In the face of the masses' angry denunciations, the Indian Embassy kept its doors shut all day. The demonstrators read out numerous protest letters, which pointed out that the serious atrocity of attacking our embassy in India, orchestrated by the Indian reactionary government, was not just a simple act of revenge due to the handling of the Indian spy Lu Guanshan case by the relevant Chinese authorities. Instead, it was part of a planned and organized anti-China wave instigated by the Indian reactionary government. This once again exposed the Indian reactionary government's ugly face of blindly following the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. The demonstrators warned the Indian anti-China clowns: If you dare to persist and continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, the seven hundred million Chinese people will give you a resolute counterattack!

	Many Red Guards from colleges and universities held up red flags and came from all directions to the Indian Embassy. They said: The Indian reactionary government actually dared to instigate thugs to insult our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. This is a serious provocation to the seven hundred million Chinese people, and we express our strongest protest. They warned the Indian reactionaries: The patience of the Chinese people has its limits, and all anti-China elements will not end well. During the demonstration, a few people from the Indian Embassy came out to provoke, but after being angrily rebuked by the Red Guards, they retreated in disarray.

    坚决回击印度反动派的反华挑衅！
    首都革命群众继续到印度使馆门前示威
    新华社十八日讯　首都革命群众今天继续到印度驻华大使馆前举行示威，强烈抗议印度反动政府猖狂地进行反华活动。
    成千成万的首都革命群众和红卫兵小将在印度使馆门前贴大字报，写抗议标语，齐声朗读毛主席语录，并愤怒地高呼：“中国人民不可侮！”“反华没有好下场！”“坚决回击印度反动派的反华挑衅！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒印度反动派！”在群众愤怒的声讨面前，印度大使馆整天大门紧闭。示威的群众在这里宣读了大批抗议书，这些抗议书指出，印度反动政府一手制造的袭击我国驻印度大使馆的严重暴行，绝不只是因为中国有关当局处理印度间谍鲁冠南案件而引起的一种简单的报复行动，而是印度反动政府有计划、有组织地掀起的反华浪潮的一个组成部分。这也再一次暴露了印度反动政府死心塌地追随美帝、苏修的丑恶面目。示威群众警告印度的反华小丑：如果你们胆敢一意孤行，继续与中国人民为敌，七亿中国人民将给予坚决的回击！
    许多大专院校的红卫兵小将高举着红旗，从四面八方来到印度使馆门前。他们说：印度反动政府竟敢指使暴徒侮辱我们心中最红最红的红太阳、中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，这是我们绝对不能容忍的，这是对七亿中国人民的严重挑衅，我们表示最最强烈的抗议。他们警告印度反动派：中国人民的忍耐是有限度的，一切反华的好汉绝不会有好下场。在群众示威的时候，印度大使馆曾经有几个人跑出来挑衅，他们在遭到红卫兵小将的愤怒斥责后狼狈退回。
