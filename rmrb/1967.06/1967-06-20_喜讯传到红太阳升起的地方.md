The joyous news of China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb spread across mountains and rivers, reaching the place where the red sun rises—the hometown of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Shaoshan. The fields and mountains instantly buzzed with excitement. Revolutionary people cheered, jumped, and ran to tell each other. Countless words and songs merged into a single voice: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

At this joyous moment, the poor and lower-middle peasants, the stationed soldiers, the Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in Shaoshan held meetings and parades to enthusiastically celebrate China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb. The Shaoshan Brigade held a symposium attended by revolutionary elders, revolutionary youth, and revolutionary cadres. They spoke passionately: China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great joy for the revolutionary people of the entire country and the world, greatly boosting the morale of revolutionary people and striking a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Everyone at the meeting resolutely declared: We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," thoroughly criticize the poison spread by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the countryside, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our regions and units to the end, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion.

The soldiers and officers of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army, who help build and defend Shaoshan, jumped for joy upon hearing the news on the radio. They held a grand celebration. Everyone said: The success of the hydrogen bomb is the result of the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. Now the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, and our national defense is more solid. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, firmly hold the gun, pick up the pen, and defend proletarian dictatorship to the death. We must learn from the soldiers, workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientists, and all relevant personnel who participated in the development and testing of nuclear weapons, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strengthen preparedness, and resolutely smash all attacks by class enemies.

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Shaoshan schools carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and marched joyfully to celebrate China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb. Some Red Guards, upon hearing the news on the radio on the night of the 17th, were so excited that they couldn't sleep. The Red Guards said: Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries have slandered and maligned our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saying that the cultural revolution has destroyed productivity. Now, the successful detonation of China's first hydrogen bomb has given them a resounding slap in the face. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation given to us by our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed through the skies, and the revolutionary people of Shaoshan were immersed in boundless joy.

    在这欢乐的时刻，韶山的贫下中农、解放军驻军、红卫兵小将和革命干部纷纷举行集会和游行，热烈欢呼我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功。韶山大队举行了由革命老人、革命青年和革命干部参加的座谈会，他们满怀激情地说：我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命又一辉煌成果。这是全国和全世界革命人民的大喜事，大长了我们革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。大家在会上坚决地表示：我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命、促生产”的伟大方针，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在农村的流毒，搞好本地区本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    帮助建设和保卫韶山的解放军驻军某部三连的干部和战士，从广播里听到这一喜讯后，高兴得跳了起来。他们隆重地举行了庆祝大会。大家说：氢弹爆炸成功是我们伟大领袖毛主席英明领导的结果。现在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大胜利，我国国防更加巩固。我们要牢记毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政。我们要向参加这次核武器研制和试验的解放军指战员、工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员学习，努力活学活用毛主席著作，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，加强战备，坚决粉碎一切阶级敌人的进攻。
    韶山学校的红卫兵小将和革命师生抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，唱着毛主席语录歌，欢欣鼓舞地游行，庆贺我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功。有的红卫兵小将十七日夜晚从广播里听到喜讯后，激动得睡不着觉。红卫兵小将们说：帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派造谣诬蔑我国无产阶级文化大革命，胡说什么文化大革命破坏了生产力。现在，我国第一颗氢弹的爆炸成功，又给了它们一记响亮的耳光。我们一定更好地活学活用毛主席著作，完成我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席交给我们的一斗二批三改的伟大任务。
    《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌声响彻云霄，韶山革命人民一直沉浸在无比的欢乐之中。
