The US imperialists, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and their lackeys, the Indian reactionary government, have recently been colluding to pressure Pakistan. They are attempting to force Pakistan to comply and form an anti-China alliance with the Indian reactionaries. The conspiracy that the US and the Soviet Union are hatching in South Asia fundamentally goes against the interests of the peoples of India and Pakistan.

After the new Indian government took office in March, following the dictates of the US and the Soviet Union, it suddenly changed its previous vicious stance towards Pakistan. It repeatedly expressed a willingness to "discuss any issue without preconditions," "at any level, any place, and any time," with Pakistan to "improve bilateral relations." It seemed very sincere. However, when the Pakistani government proposed discussing the Kashmir issue, the Indian government immediately backed down. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi flatly declared that there was nothing to negotiate regarding the Kashmir issue.

Later, Indian media revealed a new plan supposedly favorable to India for resolving the Kashmir issue, concocted by the Soviet revisionists. Subsequently, the Indian government made a complete about-face, expressing a willingness to negotiate the Kashmir issue with Pakistan. Indian Foreign Minister Chagla specially met with the Soviet deputy representative in India on May 18 to discuss this issue.

Regardless of how much India's attitude fluctuates, Pakistan's stance has been consistent: it advocates resolving the Kashmir issue according to the will of the Kashmiri people and believes that without resolving this fundamental dispute, Indo-Pakistani relations cannot truly improve.

The US and the Soviet Union have not made much progress in the Indo-Pakistani negotiations, so the US imperialists have personally intervened. They are pressuring Pakistan to conspire and establish a "joint venture" with India and attempting to make this a precondition for continuing "aid" to both countries. It is clear that the US imperialists have set a new trap here: they are trying to create US-branded economic "cooperation" between India and Pakistan as the first step in establishing an anti-China alliance.

The Pakistani government spokesperson has exposed this trap set by the US.

When one scheme fails, another is devised. The US then incited the Indian government to come up with a so-called "proposal" for "bilateral arms reduction" between India and Pakistan. According to this "proposal," the ratio of armed forces between India and Pakistan would be 4:1. In other words, under the spell of "peace" and "disarmament," Pakistan would face a menacing Indian invasion force three times its size, always in danger of being invaded and annexed.

The US imperialists' scheme to harm Pakistan has also been met with firm opposition from the Pakistani government and people. Thus, the US imperialists have further pressured Pakistan, announcing on April 12 the cessation of military "aid" to Pakistan. The US hypocritically feigned a "fair" posture, simultaneously announcing the cessation of military aid to India. This is all a deception. The US, in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, has already helped the Indian government establish a series of jet fighter factories, tank factories, and other military factories. Pakistan, however, does not have factories for manufacturing aircraft and tanks. Moreover, the Indian government will continue to receive military aid from the Soviet revisionists in the future and will even obtain a large number of US weapons from the US lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Therefore, the US's trick of simultaneously stopping military "aid" to India and Pakistan is actually aimed at creating an increasingly larger military advantage for India over Pakistan, forcing Pakistan to comply.

However, the collusion between the US and the Soviet Union has become increasingly clear to the peoples of India and Pakistan and to the people of the world. The "Tashkent Spirit" manufactured by the Soviet revisionists has already failed. Progressive public opinion in Pakistan and India is increasingly exposing the Soviet leadership clique's despicable behavior of playing both sides and betraying the revolutionary peoples of the world. Pakistani newspapers have declared unequivocally: Pakistan will absolutely not sit on the same bench with the Indian government to oppose China, and it will absolutely not sacrifice national independence to serve US interests.

    美苏印合谋逼迫巴基斯坦同印度结盟反华
    巴基斯坦人民坚决反对美苏印陷害巴基斯坦的毒计
    据新华社讯　本社记者评述：美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和它们的帮凶印度反动政府，最近正串通一气，对巴基斯坦施加压力，妄图迫使巴基斯坦就范，同印度反动派结成一个反华联盟。美帝苏修在南亚地区搞的这个阴谋，是从根本上违反印巴两国人民的利益的。
    今年三月间印度新政府上台后，按照美帝和苏修的意旨，突然改变了它过去对巴基斯坦穷凶极恶的架势，一再表示愿意“在没有先决条件的情况下”，“在任何一级、任何地方和任何时候”，同巴基斯坦讨论“任何问题”，“改善两国关系”。看起来真是很有诚意。但是，当巴基斯坦政府提出要同印度政府讨论克什米尔问题的时候，印度政府马上就不干了。印度总理英迪拉·甘地断然宣称，关于克什米尔问题没有什么好谈判的。
    后来，在印度报刊上透露了一个由苏修炮制的有利于印度的所谓解决克什米尔问题的新方案。接着，印度政府又来了一个一百八十度大转弯，表示对克什米尔问题也愿意同巴基斯坦谈判了。印度外长查格拉在五月十八日特地为了这个问题，找苏联驻印度代办进行了密谈。
    不管印度政府的态度怎样多变，巴基斯坦方面的态度一贯是明确的，它主张按克什米尔人民的意愿解决克什米尔问题，并认为不解决这个基本争端，印巴关系不可能真正改善。
    美帝和苏修在印巴谈判问题上进展并不顺利，于是，美帝国主义就亲自出马，压迫巴基斯坦合谋策划同印度建立“合营企业”，并且企图把这一点作为继续向印巴提供“援助”的先决条件。十分明显，美帝国主义在这里设下了一个新的圈套：企图搞出一个美国牌号的印巴经济“合作”，作为建立印巴反华联盟的第一步。
    巴基斯坦政府发言人断然揭破了美帝的这个圈套。
    一计不成又来一计。美帝进而鼓动印度政府找出一个所谓“印巴双方裁减军备”的“建议”。按照这个“建议”，印度和巴基斯坦的武装力量的比例将达到四比一。也就是说，在“和平”和“裁军”的迷魂曲下，巴基斯坦将面对着一支比它的军队数量超过三倍的虎视眈眈的印度侵略军，随时都有被侵略和吞并的危险。
    美帝国主义的这个陷害巴基斯坦的毒计，也遭到了巴基斯坦政府和人民的坚决反对。于是，美帝国主义就向巴基斯坦进一步施加压力，在四月十二日宣布停止向巴基斯坦提供军事“援助”。美帝假惺惺地装出一副“公平”姿态，同时也宣布停止给印度军援。这完全是骗人的。美帝伙同苏修，已经帮助印度政府建立了一系列的喷气式战斗机工厂、坦克工厂和其它军火工厂。而巴基斯坦却没有制造飞机、坦克的军火工厂。并且，印度政府今后还将继续从苏修那里得到军援，甚至还从美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮那里得到大量的美国武器。因此，美帝同时停止给予印巴军“援”的把戏，实际上是要造成印度在军事上对巴基斯坦愈来愈大的优势，压巴基斯坦就范。
    但是，美帝和苏修勾结的面目，越来越清楚地暴露在印巴人民和世界人民面前。苏修一手制造的偏袒印度反动派的“塔什干精神”，早已破产。巴基斯坦和印度进步舆论越来越多地揭露苏修领导集团玩弄反革命两手、叛卖世界革命人民的卑劣行为。巴基斯坦报刊曾经斩钉截铁地宣告：巴基斯坦绝对不同印度政府坐在一条板凳上去反对中国，绝对不牺牲民族独立去为美国的利益效劳。
