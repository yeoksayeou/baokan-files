After the proletarian revolutionary forces seize power, whether to practice thrift and frugality or to squander and waste is a major issue that concerns the direction of the power. It is also a major issue that concerns whether the dictatorship of the proletariat can be consolidated and whether the country will change color. The broad revolutionary masses must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "save and make revolution," and must forever maintain the fine tradition of hard struggle of the proletariat, oppose the extravagant and wasteful style of the bourgeoisie, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and prevent "peaceful evolution." To this end, the following regulations are made:

1. All units and mass organizations must lead the masses to seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "saving and making revolution," review work, summarize experience, think of ways, and formulate measures to save for the country every grain of rice, every inch of cloth, every sheet of paper, every watt of electricity, every cent, every drop of oil, and set an example of saving and making revolution.

2. The waste of manpower is the greatest waste. All units and mass organizations must pay great attention to saving manpower, establish a good order of revolution and production, adhere to the eight-hour workday, observe labor discipline, not absent from work without reason, and not be late or leave early. Large meetings should be held as infrequently as possible and generally should not be held during production and work hours.

3. All units and mass organizations must streamline their organizations, reduce the number of full-time personnel (grassroots units and mass organizations should not have full-time personnel), not purchase furniture, vehicles, cameras, radios, televisions, etc., not show off, not compete for wealth, not treat guests or give gifts, and not use public funds to watch plays, movies, or other performances.

4. Coal, steel, timber, electricity, petroleum, and other resources must be saved. The use of transportation tools must be economized, and the arbitrary use of raw materials and the diversion of production and transportation vehicles for non-production purposes must be prohibited to ensure the normal operation of national production and transportation.

5. The printing of propaganda materials must be planned, the quality of propaganda materials must be improved, attention must be paid to propaganda effects, the quantity must be controlled, and waste must be avoided. When writing big-character posters and large slogans, paper, ink, and glue must be saved (substitute products should be used as much as possible).

6. Financial and banking institutions and financial and economic personnel must strictly implement the state's financial system, strictly control the expenditure of office, meeting, propaganda, and travel expenses, and all expenditures that do not comply with state regulations, especially the diversion of working capital for financial expenditures, must be refused.

7. If units and mass organizations need to make armbands or banners in the future, they should make full use of old banners and old armbands for remaking.

8. All units and mass organizations must strengthen the management of materials, conduct regular inspections, promptly handle idle materials, and make full use of waste materials. They must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and strive for strength, and under permissible conditions, make and repair tools by themselves as much as possible to reduce all unnecessary expenditures.

9. Protect state property, strictly prohibit smashing, beating, and looting, and strictly prohibit embezzlement and theft. Violators will be dealt with according to the severity of the offense.

10. Resolutely oppose counter-revolutionary economism, do not issue subsidies and bonuses at will, do not privately change the wage and welfare system, and do not privately change the ownership system.

All the above items must be implemented immediately upon publication.

    北京市革命委员会关于节约闹革命的规定
    （一九六七年六月二十七日）
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，是勤俭节约，还是挥霍浪费，这是关系到政权向何处去的大问题，也是关系到无产阶级专政能不能巩固，国家变不变颜色的大问题。广大革命群众必须坚决响应毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，永远保持无产阶级艰苦奋斗的优良传统，反对资产阶级铺张浪费的作风，防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，防止“和平演变”。为此，特作如下规定：
    一、各单位、各群众组织要领导群众认真学习和贯彻执行毛主席有关“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，检查工作，总结经验，想出办法，制定措施，为国家节约一粒米，一寸布，一张纸，一度电，一分钱，一滴油，做节约闹革命的模范。
    二、劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费。各单位、各群众组织要十分重视劳动力的节约，建立革命和生产的良好秩序，坚持八小时工作制，遵守劳动纪律，不准无故旷工，不准迟到早退。大型的会要尽量少开，一般不要在生产和工作的时间内进行。
    三、各单位、各群众组织都要精简机构，减少脱产人员（基层单位的群众组织不要设脱产人员），不准购置家具、车辆、照相机、收音机、电视机等，不要讲排场、比阔气，不准请客送礼，不准用公款看戏、看电影或其他演出等。
    四、要节约煤炭、钢材、木材、电力、石油等，节约使用交通运输工具，不准随意动用原材料和调用生产运输车辆于非生产用途，切实保证国家生产和交通运输的正常进行。
    五、印刷宣传品要有计划，努力提高宣传品的质量，注意宣传效果，控制数量，避免浪费。写大字报、大标语时，要注意节约纸张、节约笔墨、节约浆糊（尽量使用代用品）。
    六、财政金融机构，财政经济人员要坚决执行国家财政制度，严格掌握办公、会议、宣传、旅差等项费用的开支，所有不符合国家规定的支出，特别是挪用流动资金，做财政性开支的，应一律拒绝支付。
    七、各单位、各群众组织今后如要制作袖章、队旗，应尽量利用旧旗旧袖章改制。
    八、各单位、各群众组织要加强对物资的管理，定期清查，及时处理闲散物资，充分利用废物。要发扬自力更生，奋发图强的革命精神，在条件许可的情况下尽量自己动手制作和修理用具，减少一切不必要的开支。
    九、爱护国家财产，严禁砸、打、抢，严禁贪污、盗窃。违者，要根据情节轻重予以处理。
    十、坚决反对反革命经济主义，不准滥发补助费和奖金，不准私自改变工资和福利制度，不准私自改变所有制。
    以上各项，自公布之日起必须立即执行。
