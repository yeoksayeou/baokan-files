In China and many other countries around the world, many people have studied the book "Self-Cultivation" and have been harmed by it to varying degrees. We cannot take this book lightly, for even if this book is completely destroyed tomorrow, we still need to resolutely fight against the fallacies within it. It is not only those who have read and studied this book who are harmed by it, but also those who have not seen this book are influenced by its "theories" through various covert means.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Fighting against erroneous ideas is like getting vaccinated. After the vaccine takes effect, one's body gains immunity."

When I talk about the harm in this English version of the book titled "How to Be a Good Communist," we must consider the background of the time when this book was written, published, revised, and deliberately mass-marketed. We must always remember the saying, "All kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." I believe that the ideas in "Self-Cultivation" can only be called counter-revolutionary thoughts.

At that time, more than half of China had been occupied by the Japanese imperialist invaders, and the Communist Party of China had become the leading force in resisting the Japanese imperialist invasion. Less than a month before the author wrote this book, Chairman Mao had already called on the nation to "oppose capitulation activities." The author wrote this book after two years of bloody warfare, at a time when capitulationists were spreading rumors and slandering the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army; at a time when Chiang Kai-shek was conspiring with imperialists to sell out the country and make compromises; at a time when they were preparing to let Japan occupy vast areas of China and shift the main focus of attack to suppressing the Communist Party. Think about it, under such circumstances, the biggest capitalist-roaders in power within the Chinese Party did not mention the War of Resistance against Japan, did not mention class struggle during the War of Resistance against Japan, did not mention mass struggle, did not talk about seizing power, and especially did not mention proletarian dictatorship. Think about it, what kind of person is this?

Of course, the author of "Self-Cultivation" did not miss any opportunity to peddle his black goods. As late as 1962, in order to make his book sellable all over the world, he deliberately did not allow large quantities of Mao Zedong's works to be published.

Just when the Communist Party of China and other Marxist-Leninist parties were being viciously attacked and slandered by the revisionist clique led by Khrushchev, "Self-Cultivation" was hastily reprinted.

Just when the revisionists were digging up Stalin's corpse from the grave, trying to deny Stalin's great achievements and destroy his lofty reputation, the author of "Self-Cultivation" almost completely deleted all mentions of Stalin in his book. Is this not bowing and scraping, catering to the needs of the Soviet revisionist clique, and attacking Stalin, which is attacking Leninism?

Since the founding of the Communist Party of Britain in 1920, I have been a member of the British Communist Party. I first came into contact with this biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Party in the early 1950s. At that time, the leaders of the British Communist Party praised "Self-Cultivation" as a must-read book for party members because "Self-Cultivation" and the British Communist Party's declaration "The British Road to Socialism" both carefully avoided mentioning proletarian dictatorship, completely in line with the revisionist policy announced at the 22nd National Congress of the British Communist Party. At that congress, the secretary of the British Communist Party openly announced the abandonment of proletarian revolution and the adoption of reformist compromise.

"Self-Cultivation" helped to stifle the revolutionary spirit of comrades and made it a habit for the leadership to be slavishly obedient.

My heart is heavy. At that time, I worked for the "Workers' Daily," which was established according to Lenin's instructions. It had no large funds; it was maintained by the help of the exploited and underpaid masses. Those masses regarded the "Workers' Daily" as a political weapon in the struggle to overthrow capitalism. When I saw that the "Workers' Daily" could no longer play a role in mobilizing, propagating, and organizing the masses in the struggle, I felt very sad.

But I did not resist. I faithfully carried out the tasks assigned to me by my superiors. I was also very proud to be a Communist Party member. I was very afraid that the party would discipline me and that I would end up being expelled from the party in disgrace.

Sometimes I couldn't hold back and raised some protests, but they were ineffective. I comforted myself that the party would eventually be purified.

Of course, when I studied "Self-Cultivation," I had not yet had the opportunity to learn the thoughts of Chairman Mao and truly master his Marxist-Leninist principles: "Whatever is reactionary, you don't beat it, it won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. If the broom doesn't reach, the dust will not run away by itself." So although I knew in my heart that those things were wrong, I still continued to obey without resistance.

Under the leadership of the British Communist Party's revisionists, the "Workers' Daily" became a copy of a capitalist newspaper. In order to expand its circulation at all costs, it did not hesitate to publish pornographic photos, horse racing results, the latest fashion, beauty tips for eternal youth, and reports on criminal cases.

I had been in the news industry for twenty years. In order to seek truth again, I finally left the news industry and returned to the coal mine, living and working with my class brothers.

I was born into the British working class and grew up among miners and textile workers, enduring hardships and various humiliations every day. It was this that made me realize relatively early on that the only way out for the working class is to overthrow capitalism through a proletarian revolution.

In the long struggle of strikes, when I was a picket, in the hunger marches, in the struggle against landlord evictions, I had seen the living spirit of proletarian rebellion that dared to challenge the capitalist rulers and dared to openly resist reactionary forces. Mass struggle is the source of my life. It was mass struggle that made me join the British Communist Party, which was founded soon after the October Revolution.

But nearly twenty years later, when I returned to my original party branch, I found that those comrades who had fought bravely in the past tense years of class struggle had also become accustomed to blind obedience. This blind obedience had grown like cancer into the hearts of my old comrades. Their past proletarian initiative and spirit of taking revolutionary action in a timely manner were gone. They were now almost completely cut off from the masses. They did nothing, relying on instructions from above. When the so-called "must be executed" instructions came down, a few loyal followers always tried their best to carry them out, regardless of whether they were suitable for local conditions.

Thus, the party branch degenerated, and the number of party members became fewer and fewer. Party life became empty and meaningless, with no revolutionary content. The party leadership followed the reformist Labor Party, with no mass base. It was content to spend the hard-earned money of the workers on parliamentary elections and propaganda for the parliamentary road to socialism. Meanwhile, the leadership of the British Communist Party was more subservient to the policies of the Moscow revisionists than ever before. Whenever the modern revisionist ruling clique in Moscow waved its baton, it would follow suit. As long as Khrushchev and his ilk gave the order, it would obey, bow its head, and follow orders.

I came to China in 1962. When I came to China, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique that betrayed Marxist-Leninist principles was sacrificing and betraying socialist China. But the Chinese people resolutely refused to follow the road set by the Moscow revisionist clique. I saw the billion Chinese people standing firmly, determined to build a prosperous and powerful socialist society under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, determined to carry the proletarian revolution in China and the world to the end.

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which sweeps away all monsters and ghosts and exposes all counter-revolutionary revisionists who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, I realized that a Marxist-Leninist must devote his whole being to the struggle against revisionism, must highlight proletarian politics. We must wage an irreconcilable struggle against those who insist on taking the capitalist road. We must completely criticize and denounce "Self-Cultivation," and completely eradicate the pernicious influence of "Self-Cultivation" internationally.

    彻底肃清《修养》在国际上的流毒
    英国　露丝·史密斯
    在中国和世界许多国家，很多人都学习过《修养》一书，都在不同程度上受到《修养》的毒害。对这本书可不能掉以轻心，因为即使这本书在明天全部销毁的话，我们还是要和书里的谬论作坚决的斗争。不单是读过和研究过这本书的人才受它的毒害，而且这本书的“理论”通过各种隐蔽的方式对许多没有看过这本书的人施加影响。
    毛主席教导说：“同错误思想作斗争，好比种牛痘，经过了牛痘疫苗的作用，人身上就增强免疫力。”
    在我讲到这本英文版的书名叫做《怎样做一个好的共产党员》的书里毒害的时候，我们有必要考虑到写这本书，发行、修改这本书，以及故意大量推销这本书的时代背景。我们必须经常记住“各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”这句话。我认为《修养》这本书的思想只能叫做反革命的思想。
    当时一半以上的中国已经被日本帝国主义侵略者占领，中国共产党已经成为抗击日本帝国主义侵略的领导力量。作者写这本书前不到一个月的时间里，毛主席已经向全国发出了“反对投降活动”的号召。作者写这本书是在两年浴血战争之后，正是投降主义者散布流言蜚语，攻击谩骂共产党、八路军和新四军的时候；正是蒋介石伙同帝国主义者进行卖国妥协的投降密谋的时候；正是他们准备让日本占领中国广大地区，把主攻方向转移到镇压共产党的时候。请大家想一想，在这种情况下，中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竟然在讲课中不提抗日战争，不提抗日战争时期的阶级斗争，不提群众斗争，不谈夺取政权，特别是根本不提无产阶级专政。请大家想一想，这种人究竟是什么样的人。
    当然《修养》一书的作者丝毫不放过一切机会来贩卖他的黑货，直到一九六二年为了使得他的书能够倾销世界各地，他还故意不让大量出版毛泽东著作。
    正当中国共产党和其他马列主义政党受到以赫鲁晓夫为首的修正主义集团恶毒攻击和谩骂的时候，《修养》一书仓促再版。
    正当修正主义者把斯大林的尸体从墓中搬出来，企图否定斯大林的伟大功绩和毁坏他的崇高声誉的时候，《修养》一书的作者把他书中提到斯大林的地方几乎全都删掉了。这不是卑躬屈膝，迎合苏修集团需要，大反斯大林，也就是大反列宁主义，又是什么？
    自从一九二○年英国共产党成立，我一直是英共党员。我第一次接触到这个中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是在五十年代初。当时英共领导人把《修养》这本书吹捧为党员必读的书，因为《修养》和英共宣言“英国通向社会主义之路”一样，小心翼翼地避免提到无产阶级专政，完完全全和英共二十二次全国代表大会上发表的修正主义政策相呼应。在那次会上英共书记公开宣布放弃无产阶级革命，实行改良主义妥协。
    《修养》一书帮助扼杀了革命同志的斗志，对领导奴隶般的顺从成为当时的习惯。
    我的心情是非常沉痛的。我那时候在《工人日报》工作，《工人日报》是遵照列宁的嘱咐办起来的。它没有大量资金，它是靠受剥削的、收入不足的群众的帮助得到维持的。那些群众把《工人日报》当作推翻资本主义斗争中的政治武器。在我看到《工人日报》不再能起到鼓动群众，宣传群众和组织群众的战斗作用的时候，我感到非常难过。
    但是我没有反抗，我忠实地执行了上级交给我的任务，我还非常自豪自己是一个共产党员。我很害怕党会对我进行党籍处分，落得个不光彩的被开除出党的下场。
    有时我憋不住，提出一些抗议，但是不见效。我安慰自己党终究会得到纯结的。
    当然，在我学习《修养》的时候，我还没有机会学到毛主席的思想，没有真正掌握他的马列主义原理：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”所以虽然我心里明白那些东西是错的，但是我还是继续毫无反抗地服从。
    在英共修正主义领导下，《工人日报》变成了资本主义报纸的翻版，为了竭力扩大销售量，不惜刊登色情照片、赛马行情、时新服装式样、永葆青春美丽的妙方和刑事案件的报道。
    我在新闻界已经干了二十年，为了重新寻求真理，我最终离开了新闻行业，回到了煤矿，和我的阶级兄弟一起生活，一起工作。
    我出身于英国工人阶级，我是在矿工和纺织工人中间长大的，每天和他们一样，忍受着艰难困苦和各种侮辱。就是这样，我比较早地认识到工人阶级的唯一出路就是通过无产阶级革命推翻资本主义。
    在持续很久的罢工斗争里，在我做罢工纠察队员的时候，在参加反饥饿进军中，在反房产主驱逐的斗争中，我曾经看到了敢于向资本主义当权者挑战，敢于公开反抗反动势力的、那种活生生的无产阶级造反精神。群众斗争是我生命的源泉。就是群众斗争使我加入了十月革命之后不久成立的英国共产党。
    但是，事隔将近二十年，当我回到我原来的党支部，我发现那些在过去紧张的阶级斗争年代中英勇奋战的同志们也习惯于盲目服从。这种盲目服从象癌症一样长到了我那些老战友的心脏里。他们过去的无产阶级主动性和敢于及时采取革命行动的精神已经没有了。他们现在几乎完全和群众隔绝。他们无所作为，依靠上面发指示。在那些所谓“必须执行的”指示下来的时候，不论是否适合当地的情况，少数忠实追随者总是想方设法地去执行。
    这样，党支部就退化了，党员人数越来越少。党的生活变得空洞无物，没有任何革命内容。党的领导追随改良主义的工党，没有什么群众基础。它心满意足地把工人得来不易的钱花在议会竞选上，花在宣扬通过议会道路到达社会主义的宣传上。与此同时，英国共产党的领导比过去任何时候都顺从于莫斯科修正主义者的政策。莫斯科现代修正主义统治集团一挥舞指挥棒，它就跟着转。只要赫鲁晓夫之流一声令下，它就俯首贴耳，百依百顺，处处照办。
    我是一九六二年到中国来的。我来到中国时，背叛马列主义原则的苏修领导集团正在牺牲和出卖社会主义中国。但中国人民坚决拒绝走莫斯科修正主义集团确定的道路，我看到亿万中国人民站稳脚跟，决心在毛主席的英明领导下奋勇前进，自力更生地建设起繁荣富强的社会主义，决心把中国和全世界的无产阶级革命进行到底。
    我很幸运，有机会参加了这场横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，揭露一切打着红旗反红旗的反革命修正主义分子的无产阶级文化大革命。在毛泽东思想的指导下，我认识到一个马列主义者必须以全部身心投入反修斗争中去，必须突出无产阶级政治。我们必须和那些坚持走资本主义道路的人作不调和的斗争。把《修养》彻底批倒批臭，彻底肃清《修养》在国际上的恶劣影响。
