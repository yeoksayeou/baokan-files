The Chinese Government Issues a Statement Solemnly Declaring to the World:
Resolutely Support the Arab People in Opposing US-Israeli Aggression,
Condemn US-Israeli Provocations Against Asian, African, and World Peoples,
and Expose the Ugly Face of Soviet Revisionists in Indulging US-Israeli Aggression

	New China News Agency, June 6th
	The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on June 6th. The full text is as follows:

	Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China
	June 6, 1967

	On June 5, 1967, Israel, instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism, launched a large-scale armed aggression against the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other Arab countries. This is another heinous crime committed by U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, against the Arab people, and a serious provocation against the Asian, African, and world peoples. The Arab peoples of various countries are united in their indignation and have risen up to give the aggressors a resounding blow. A storm of struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression has swept across the entire Arab world.

	Israel is a product of the aggressive policies of Anglo-American imperialism. After World War II, without the support of U.S. imperialism, Israel could not have existed; without the backing of U.S. imperialism, Israel would not have dared to attack Arab countries. The mastermind behind Israel's aggression against Syria is U.S. imperialism; the one who, together with British imperialism, threatened to use force to open the Gulf of Aqaba is U.S. imperialism; and now, the one providing Israel with large quantities of weapons to launch surprise attacks on the United Arab Republic and other Arab countries is still U.S. imperialism. The facts fully prove that U.S. imperialism is the backer of Zionism and the number one enemy of the Arab people and the people of the world.

	In this incident, the Soviet revisionist leadership has indulged U.S. imperialism's instigation and support for Israel's aggression, once again exposing its ugly face of betraying the Arab people.

	The greatest leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, pointed out: "The tide of the people of the world opposing the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will certainly achieve even greater victories." The United Arab Republic, Syria, and other Arab countries, along with the Palestinian Arab people, are waging a just war against U.S.-Israeli aggression. A just war is invincible. The heroic Arab people, with their glorious anti-imperialist tradition, have raised the banner of struggle against aggression. We believe that, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, as long as the Arab people strengthen their unity, persist in their struggle, and overcome all difficulties, they will certainly achieve final victory.

	The Chinese government solemnly declares: The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will never allow U.S. imperialism and its accomplices to run rampant and invade everywhere. We stand firmly on the side of the Arab people and resolutely support their just war against U.S.-Israeli aggression.

	Victory will definitely belong to the brave Arab people in their struggle!

    我国政府发表声明向全世界庄严宣告
    坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美以侵略
    谴责美以对亚非人民和全世界人民的严重挑衅，揭露苏修纵容美以侵略的丑恶嘴脸
    新华社六日讯　中华人民共和国政府六日发表声明，声明全文如下：
                                   中华人民共和国政府声明
                                       一九六七年六月六日
    一九六七年六月五日，以色列在美帝国主义的策动和支持下，悍然对阿联、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家发动大规模的武装侵略。这是美帝国主义及其工具以色列对阿拉伯人民犯下的又一次滔天罪行，也是对亚非人民和全世界人民的严重挑衅。阿拉伯各国人民同仇敌忾，一致奋起，正在给予侵略者以迎头痛击。一场反对美帝侵略斗争的风暴，已经席卷整个阿拉伯世界。
    以色列是美英帝国主义侵略政策的产物。二次大战后，没有美帝国主义的扶植，以色列根本不可能存在；没有美帝国主义的支持，以色列根本不敢向阿拉伯国家发动进攻。阴谋策动以色列向叙利亚发动进攻的，是美帝国主义；伙同英帝国主义威胁要用武力打通亚喀巴湾的，是美帝国主义；现在，给以色列大量武器，向阿联等阿拉伯国家进行突然袭击的，也还是美帝国主义。事实完全证明，美帝国主义是犹太复国主义的后台老板，是阿拉伯和全世界人民的头号敌人。
    在这次事件中，苏修领导集团纵容了美帝国主义策动和支持以色列的侵略，再一次暴露了它出卖阿拉伯人民的丑恶嘴脸。
    中国人民最伟大的领袖毛泽东主席指出：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”阿联和叙利亚等阿拉伯国家和巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民正在进行着一场反对美、以侵略的正义战争。正义的战争是不可战胜的。具有光荣反帝传统的、英雄的阿拉伯人民，已经举起了反对侵略战争的义旗。我们相信，在全世界人民的同情和支持下，只要阿拉伯人民加强团结，坚持斗争，前赴后继，排除万难，他们就一定会赢得最后的胜利。
    中国政府庄严宣告：用毛泽东思想武装起来的、正在胜利进行着无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，决不容许美帝国主义及其合伙者横行霸道，到处侵略。我们坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，坚决支持他们反对美、以侵略的正义战争。
    胜利一定属于英勇战斗的阿拉伯人民！
