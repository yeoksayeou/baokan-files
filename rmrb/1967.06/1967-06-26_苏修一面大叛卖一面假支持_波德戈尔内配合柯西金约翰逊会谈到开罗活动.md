The Soviet revisionist leadership, which is currently intensifying its activities for a global counter-revolutionary collusion with the United States, has one of its key figures, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Podgorny, engage in a three-day activity in the United Arab Republic (UAR) before departing Cairo on the 24th.

After the Soviet revisionist leadership's traitorous face was fully exposed in the recent U.S.-British-Israeli aggression against Arab countries, they hurriedly demanded an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. Another key figure of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Kosygin, personally went to the United States, feigning a posture of "condemning" Israeli aggression and "supporting" Arab countries, attempting to cover up its role as the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism and to salvage the situation of its isolation in the Arab world due to its betrayal. Podgorny's activities in the UAR were conducted under this background.

During his stay in the UAR, Podgorny held a series of talks with UAR President Nasser on the Middle East situation and the relations between the Soviet Union and the UAR. According to a report by the Middle East News Agency, both sides issued a brief news communiqué after the talks. The communiqué stated that both sides "discussed the issues related to the Middle East situation and measures to eliminate the consequences of Israeli aggression," and exchanged views on "some important international issues of common concern." The communiqué did not specify what measures would be taken to "eliminate the consequences of this aggression."

According to reports, during his stay in the UAR, Podgorny maintained close contact with Moscow and with Kosygin, who was in the United States coordinating with U.S. imperialist leader Johnson. The Cairo newspaper *Al-Ahram* reported that before Podgorny's five-hour talk with Nasser on the 23rd, "on the one hand, he maintained regular contact with Moscow, and on the other hand, before Premier Kosygin's talks with President Johnson, he also maintained regular contact with Kosygin." The newspaper also said that the second round of talks between Podgorny and Nasser, originally scheduled for the evening of the 22nd, was changed to a "secret and urgent" meeting in the morning of the 22nd after Podgorny received an urgent letter from Kosygin in New York. Meanwhile, according to the Associated Press, Podgorny's talks with Nasser "were closely coordinated with the high-level meeting between the leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Glassboro."

After leaving Cairo, Podgorny went to Yugoslavia the same day for another round of activities, holding an "unexpected" meeting with Tito on the Middle East issue. Before going to Cairo, Podgorny had specially gone to Yugoslavia on the 20th to have a talk with Tito.

According to a report by *Al-Ahram* on the 25th, a military delegation led by the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy, Zaharov, is still in Cairo, "continuing discussions on certain aspects of the Arab-Soviet talks."

    苏修一面大叛卖一面假支持
    波德戈尔内配合柯西金约翰逊会谈到开罗活动
    新华社二十五日讯正在为苏美反革命全球性大勾结加紧活动的苏联修正主义领导集团的头目之一、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内，在阿联进行了三天的活动之后，二十四日离开开罗。
    苏修领导集团在最近美英以侵略阿拉伯国家中出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒面目彻底大暴露以后，急忙要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，苏修领导集团的另一个头目柯西金亲自去美国，装出一副“谴责”以色列侵略、“支持”阿拉伯国家的姿态，企图掩盖它充当美帝头号帮凶的丑恶嘴脸，竭力挽回由于它的叛卖而在阿拉伯世界陷于空前孤立的局面。波德戈尔内就是在这种背景下去阿联活动的。
    波德戈尔内在阿联期间，同阿联总统纳赛尔就中东局势以及苏联和阿联的关系等问题举行了一系列的会谈。据中东通讯社报道，双方在会谈后发表了一项简短的新闻公报。新闻公报说，双方“考虑了有关中东局势的问题和清除以色列侵略造成的后果的措施”，并就“共同关心的一些重要国际问题交换了意见”。新闻公报没有具体谈到采取什么措施来“消除这种侵略的后果”。
    据报道，波德戈尔内在阿联期间，同莫斯科和正在美国同美帝国主义头子约翰逊勾搭的柯西金保持密切的联系。开罗《金字塔报》报道，波德戈尔内在二十三日和纳赛尔举行约五小时的长谈以前，“一方面同莫斯科保持经常的联系，另一方面在柯西金总理同约翰逊总统会谈以前，同柯西金也保持经常的联系”。这家报纸还说，波德戈尔内和纳赛尔的第二轮会谈原定在二十二日晚上举行，但是，当波德戈尔内收到柯西金从纽约给他的一封急信后，二十二日上午他同纳赛尔举行了一次事先没有安排的“秘密和紧急的”会谈。同时，据美联社透露，波德戈尔内和纳赛尔的会谈“是同美苏两国首脑在葛拉斯堡罗举行的最高级会议密切配合的”。
    波德戈尔内在离开开罗后的当天再次到南斯拉夫活动，同铁托就中东问题举行“突然性的”会晤。波德戈尔内到开罗活动前在二十日曾特地到南斯拉夫同铁托会谈过一次。
    据《金字塔报》二十五日报道，以苏联陆海军总参谋长扎哈罗夫为首的一个军事代表团目前仍在开罗，“就阿—苏会谈中的某些方面”继续进行讨论。
