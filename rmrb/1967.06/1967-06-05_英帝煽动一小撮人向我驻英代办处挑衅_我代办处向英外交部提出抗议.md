In the instigation and encouragement of the British government and bourgeois propaganda machine, a small group of individuals loyal to British imperialism today morning rushed to the gate of the Chinese mission in the UK to cause trouble, once again shamelessly provoking the great Chinese people.

This morning, about a dozen provocateurs, accompanied by a few policemen, performed a farce in front of the Chinese mission in the UK. These individuals, playing "God Save the Queen," came to the gate of the Chinese mission. However, they were cowardly and did not dare to hold up their placards. Two "representatives" of this group attempted to deliver a "protest" letter to the Chinese mission; however, this letter was immediately thrown out. These two individuals could only pick it up in embarrassment. Fifteen minutes later, this small group of provocateurs hurriedly fled.

In recent days, with the connivance of the British government, some hooligans and thugs have been continuously writing letters and making phone calls to threaten the Chinese mission.

The Chinese mission has strongly protested to the British Foreign Office against these shameless provocations by British imperialism.

    英帝煽动一小撮人向我驻英代办处挑衅
　　我代办处向英外交部提出抗议
    据新华社伦敦三日电　在英国官方和资产阶级宣传机器授意和煽动下，一小撮效忠英帝国主义的挑衅分子今天上午跑到中国驻英代办处门前捣乱，自不量力地又一次向伟大的中国人民进行无耻挑衅。
    今天上午，十几个挑衅分子在中国驻英代办处门前演出了一幕丑剧。这帮家伙由几个警察伴同，奏着“上帝保佑女王”的曲子，来到中国代办处门前。但是他们做贼心虚，连标语牌也不敢举起，这一伙的两个“代表”企图向中国代办处投递“抗议”信；可是这封信立即被扔出门外。这两个家伙只好狼狈地把它捡起来。十五分钟之后，这一小撮挑衅者就匆匆溜走了。
    连日来，在英国官方的纵容下，一些流氓和暴徒不断写信和打电话对中国代办进行恫吓。
    对英帝国主义这些无耻挑衅，中国代办处已经向英国外交部提出强烈抗议。
