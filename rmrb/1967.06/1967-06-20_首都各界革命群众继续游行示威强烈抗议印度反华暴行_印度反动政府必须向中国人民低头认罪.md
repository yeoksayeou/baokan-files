The capital's revolutionary masses from various sectors continued their protests and demonstrations today, strongly condemning the anti-China atrocities committed by the Indian reactionary government. The Indian reactionary government must bow down and apologize to the Chinese people.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, the capital's revolutionary masses from various sectors reached a new high in their protests against the anti-China atrocities committed by the Indian reactionary government. Tens of thousands of protesters sternly warned the Indian reactionary government: the 700 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with. Chinese diplomats armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be insulted. Any provocation against the Chinese people will be met with a double retaliation.

Today, from morning to evening, countless revolutionary workers, students, cadres, and Red Guards gathered in front of the Indian Embassy, repeatedly shouting in anger: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" "Resolutely counter the Indian reactionaries' anti-China provocations!"

Many factory workers rushed to the Indian Embassy as soon as their shifts ended, pasting protest posters on the walls of the embassy. The workers angrily pointed out that the incident where the Indian reactionary government instigated thugs to severely beat our diplomatic personnel is a shocking atrocity in the history of international diplomacy. The Indian reactionary government must bow down and apologize to the Chinese people, immediately punish the culprits, compensate for all damages, and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again. They must ensure the absolute safety of our embassy personnel. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be entirely their responsibility.

The protesting revolutionary masses read out one protest letter after another, like cannonballs aimed at the Indian reactionary government. Many revolutionary youngsters from the Capital Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee emphasized in their protest letters that whether it is the reactionaries in China or foreign reactionaries, anyone who dares to oppose our most beloved Chairman Mao will be fought to the end. Today, we not only have atomic bombs and missiles but have also successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb. This has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampened the spirits of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. We sternly warn the Indian reactionaries that we will resolutely carry out the instructions of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao: "If someone does not offend me, I will not offend them. If someone offends me, I will surely offend them." All anti-China "heroes" in the world will meet a bad end, and the Indian reactionary government will also meet a bad end.

In Beijing, Pakistani experts and the capital's revolutionary masses together came to the Indian Embassy to protest, strongly condemning the Indian reactionaries' frenzied anti-China fascist atrocities.

    首都各界革命群众继续游行示威强烈抗议印度反华暴行
    印度反动政府必须向中国人民低头认罪
    据新华社十九日讯  首都各界革命群众强烈抗议印度反动政府反华暴行的示威活动，今天达到新的高潮。成千成万的示威群众严重警告印度反动政府：七亿中国人民决不是好惹的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国外交人员是不可侮的。对中国人民的任何挑衅，都将遭到加倍的回击。
    今天，从早到晚，数不清的革命工人、革命师生、革命干部和红卫兵小将聚集在印度驻中国大使馆门前，不断地愤怒高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒印度反动派！”“坚决回击印度反动派的反华挑衅！”
    许多工厂的革命工人一下班就直奔印度大使馆，把抗议的大字报贴到印度大使馆的墙壁上。工人们愤怒指出，印度反动政府指使暴徒毒打我国外交人员的严重事件，是世界外交史上骇人听闻的暴行。印度反动政府必须向中国人民低头认罪，立即惩办凶手，赔偿一切损失，并保证今后不再发生类似事件，保证我使馆人员的绝对安全。否则，由此而引起的一切严重后果，都必须全部由你们负责。
    示威的革命群众在这里宣读的一份份抗议书，象炮弹一样射向印度反动政府。首都红代会的许多革命小将们在抗议书中强调说，无论是中国的反动派还是外国的反动派，谁胆敢反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，我们就坚决和它斗争到底。今天，我们不仅有了原子弹、导弹，而且还成功地爆炸了氢弹。这就大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。我们严正地警告印度反动派，我们坚决执行伟大的最高统帅毛主席的指示：“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。”世界上一切反华的“好汉”都没有好下场，印度反动政府也决不会有好下场。（附图片）
