The performance of "The Harbor" to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the first revolutionary model Peking opera that successfully portrays the noble qualities of the working class in the socialist era. It is the first time that the heroic image of the working class in the socialist era has been brought to the Peking opera stage. "The Harbor" shines with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong and is a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since its premiere, "The Harbor" has been warmly welcomed by audiences both at home and abroad.

After the performance, the actors waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts!" Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, and other comrades went on stage, shook hands with the revolutionary cultural warriors, congratulated them on their successful performance, and took a group photo with the revolutionary cultural warriors.
