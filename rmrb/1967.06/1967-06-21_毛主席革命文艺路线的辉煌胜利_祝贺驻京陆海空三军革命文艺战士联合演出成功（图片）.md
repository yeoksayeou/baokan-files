Song and Dance: Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Publication of Chairman Mao's Brilliant Work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"

Chairman Mao's great brilliant work—

"Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,"

Is the red flag fluttering in the hearts of every revolutionary soldier,

Is the lighthouse shining with golden rays.

March forward along Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Stride forward with bold steps in the direction of the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

Song and Dance: Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Line!

Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line shines brilliantly,

The flowers of proletarian revolutionary literature and art bloom in profusion,

Burying the feudal lords, generals, scholars, and beauties thoroughly,

Let the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers stand forever on the stage of literature and art.

Dance: Chairman Mao Comes to Our Warship

The vast sea waves surge with joy,

The people's soldiers burst into happy laughter,

The great helmsman Chairman Mao comes to our warship,

The sailors are determined to hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher!

Dance: Fiercely Attack the Biggest Capitalist-Roader in the Party

"The Notice" is a great Marxist-Leninist document,

It sounds the advance signal for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The invincible and boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought,

Will forever illuminate our ironclad proletarian dictatorship.

Solo: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!

Every word of yours is the truth.

The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble with fear,

The revolutionary people are filled with fighting spirit.

We revolutionary literary and artistic warriors,

Will forever sing your praises aloud.

Large-Scale Song and Dance: Performance of Revolutionary Historical Songs

The majestic city of Zunyi stands by the Wujiang River,

A clap of thunder echoes,

Raising the red sun to illuminate the mountains and rivers,

Mao Zedong leads us forward,

Mao Zedong is always by our side.
