Warmly Welcoming Zambian Guests

Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, arrives in Beijing today to pay a state visit to our country. The Chinese government and people warmly welcome the distinguished guests from the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist frontline in Central and Southern Africa.

The Zambian people have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Over the past half-century, the Zambian people have waged a long and arduous struggle for national independence and finally achieved it in 1964. Under the leadership of President Kaunda, the Republic of Zambia has made remarkable achievements in maintaining national independence and developing the national economy. The Chinese people are very pleased with the achievements made by the Zambian people. In international affairs, Zambia pursues a policy of non-alignment, opposes imperialism and old and new colonialism, and supports the African national independence movement. The Chinese people actively support the Zambian people's just stance.

The peoples of China and Zambia have established deep friendship in their common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Zambia, the friendly relations between the two peoples have continued to develop. The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Zambian peoples is unbreakable by anyone.

President Kaunda is visiting our country at a time when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. During their visit to our country, the distinguished guests will see with their own eyes the spirit of the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who dare to make revolution, dare to rebel, and dare to create. They will see the great achievements of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and see the firm stand of the Chinese people in resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples, as well as their deep friendship towards the African people.

We are convinced that President Kaunda's visit to our country will help to deepen the mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Zambia, and thus contribute to the further development of friendly relations between the two countries and the cause of Asian and African peoples uniting to oppose imperialism.

    热烈欢迎赞比亚贵宾
    赞比亚共和国总统肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达应周恩来总理的邀请，今日到达北京，对我国进行国事访问。我国政府和人民热烈欢迎来自中南非反帝反殖前哨的贵宾们。
    赞比亚人民有着反帝反殖的光荣传统。在过去半个多世纪中，赞比亚人民为了争取民族独立进行了长期艰苦的斗争，终于在一九六四年获得了独立。赞比亚共和国在卡翁达总统领导下，在维护民族独立、发展民族经济方面取得了显著的成就。中国人民对于赞比亚人民所取得的这些成就，感到十分高兴。在国际事务中，赞比亚奉行不结盟政策，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支持非洲民族独立运动。中国人民积极支持赞比亚人民这一正义立场。
    中赞两国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中建立了深厚的友谊。中赞两国建立外交关系以后，中赞人民的友好关系不断获得发展。中国人民和赞比亚人民的战斗友谊，是任何人也破坏不了的。
    卡翁达总统是在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时候，到我国来进行国事访问的。贵宾们在访问我国期间，将亲眼看到用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民敢于革命、敢于造反、敢于创造的精神面貌，看到我国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成果，看到中国人民坚决支持被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命斗争的坚定立场以及对非洲人民的深厚友谊。
    我们深信，卡翁达总统的这次访问我国，必将有助于增进中赞两国人民的相互了解，从而对中赞两国友好关系的进一步发展和亚非人民团结反帝的事业作出贡献。
