The "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Styles" issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee is an important document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting yesterday and decided to seriously study and resolutely implement this document. All proletarian revolutionary factions in the city must strictly execute it and truly achieve it.

The issues raised in the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are not minor issues of personal conduct but are major political principles concerning how the proletarian revolutionary factions, after seizing power, can achieve the revolutionization of leading organs, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, eternally execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

As early as 1949, on the eve of national victory, Chairman Mao warned us to be vigilant against "attacks by bullets wrapped in sugar." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao, in light of the new challenges faced by the proletarian revolutionary factions after seizing power, has issued a series of extremely important latest instructions. He repeatedly emphasized the need to "save money to make revolution"; proposed that after the establishment of revolutionary committees, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must not detach themselves from the masses, and must "be both an 'official' and a commoner." Chairman Mao particularly pointed out that leading cadres should not rely on past merits but should create new achievements. All these instructions are the most powerful weapons given to us by Chairman Mao to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and to smash the enemy's plot of "peaceful evolution." They are also another alarm bell sounded by Chairman Mao for us proletarian revolutionary factions. We must engrave Chairman Mao's series of important instructions in our hearts, implement them in action, and eternally preserve the youth of the proletarian revolution.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions have seized power, the struggle between bourgeois restoration and proletarian anti-restoration continues to exist. The main feature of this struggle is that the bourgeoisie corrupts and infiltrates the proletarian revolutionary factions, especially the leadership core, to achieve "peaceful evolution." They sing praises and flatter the proletarian revolutionary factions in front of them. If we lose vigilance and become intoxicated by flattery and praise, some of our comrades will lose the ability to distinguish right from wrong and confuse friends with enemies, ultimately leading to "peaceful evolution." We must never consider those who flatter us with ulterior motives as friends and confidants. If we maintain the concept of class struggle, we can repel the attacks of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets; otherwise, we will be in danger of being hit.

The infiltration of bourgeois ideology always works through our own minds. As the saying goes, "Flies don't buzz around unbroken eggs," and "A tightly woven fence keeps out wild dogs." If the "fence" in our minds is tightly woven, the "wild dog" of bourgeois ideology cannot get in. We must be aware that after seizing power, it is easy to become arrogant and develop a tendency to "make revolution comfortably." "Making revolution comfortably" is 100% revisionism. Anyone who slides down this path will comfortably "peacefully evolve."

Can we regard the issue of living habits as a trivial matter? No, it is not trivial. The "peaceful evolution" of an individual often starts with a breach in their living habits. A little special treatment in living habits is like a small hole. If you do not heighten your vigilance and plug it in time, the bourgeois wind will keep blowing in, developing to an uncontrollable extent. If living habits of special treatment are allowed to develop, they will comfortably "revise" away. We must block bourgeois ideology at this living habits checkpoint and wage an uncompromising struggle against bourgeois ideological and work styles.

Currently, some members and staff of revolutionary committees exhibit the "five more, five less" phenomenon. "Five more" refers to: more podium appearances, more car rides, more time in offices, more theater visits, and more badges; "five less" refers to: less study, less labor, less participation in struggle-criticism-transformation, less contact with the masses, and less revolutionary rebel spirit. This is a problem that deserves serious attention. The "five more, five less" phenomenon indicates what? It indicates that some comrades have begun to treat themselves specially in their living habits, have detached themselves from the masses, and have become bureaucratic rather than appearing as ordinary laborers, i.e., as "commoners." This is a very bad sign. If allowed to develop, it will be very dangerous.

Some comrades have the "passing the test" mentality. They always feel that they have already "passed" this cultural revolution, so they become complacent in their thinking, nurturing a sense of tranquility, and relaxing their self-transformation. We live in a class society where bourgeois ideology will always infiltrate our minds. The enemy in our minds will not fall if you do not fight them. If you relax the struggle against them, they will attack you and "eat" you. We must adopt an offensive posture to defeat bourgeois ideology. Therefore, we must never have the "passing the test" mentality. Self-transformation must never be relaxed. We must follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao and eternally keep Chairman Mao's evergreen brilliant works "Old Three Articles" as our motto, study them and put them into practice, carry out the struggle to criticize selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and achieve ideological revolutionization.

We must cherish the excellent situation of the Shanghai Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ride the east wind, and work hard to actively participate in the great criticism movement. In the process of great criticism and great struggle, while transforming the objective world, we must also transform our subjective world. We must closely follow Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the revolutionary masses, pushing the excellent situation in Shanghai forward by a big step.

    永葆革命的青春
    《文汇报》六月二十四日社论
    山东省革命委员会发出的《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的重要文件。上海市革命委员会昨天召开扩大会议，作出了认真学习、坚决贯彻这个文件的决定。全市无产阶级革命派必须不折不扣地执行，切切实实地做到。
    《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》中所提出的问题，决不是一个生活小节问题，而是无产阶级革命派夺权以后，如何实现领导机关革命化，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，巩固无产阶级专政，永远执行毛主席的革命路线，把社会主义革命进行到底的重大政治性的原则问题。
    早在一九四九年，全国胜利前夕，毛主席就告诫我们，要警惕“人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击”。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席针对无产阶级革命派夺权以后面临的新考验，又发出了一系列极为重要的最新指示。他老人家一再强调“要节约闹革命”；提出了革命委员会成立以后，革命群众组织的负责人一定不要脱离群众，要“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。毛主席特别指出领导干部不要吃老本，要立新功。所有这些指示，都是毛主席交给我们的防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，粉碎阶级敌人“和平演变”阴谋的最有力的武器，也是对我们无产阶级革命派敲起的又一次警钟。我们必须把毛主席的一系列重要指示，铭刻在心头，落实到行动，永葆无产阶级革命的青春。
    无产阶级革命派掌了权以后，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争依然存在。这场斗争的主要特点就是资产阶级对无产阶级革命派，特别是对领导核心，进行腐蚀侵袭，搞“和平演变”。他们在无产阶级革命派面前，百般歌功颂德，阿谀奉承。如果我们对此丧失警惕，陶醉于吹吹拍拍，拉拉捧捧，就会使我们的一些同志是非不分，敌我混淆，最后走上“和平演变”的道路。千万不要把那些别有用心地吹捧我们的人，当作朋友和心腹。我们如果保持着阶级斗争的观念，就能击退资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，反之，就有被击中的危险。
    资产阶级思想的侵蚀，总是要通过我们自己的脑子起作用的。俗话说得好：“苍蝇不叮无缝的鸡蛋”，“篱笆扎得紧，野狗钻不进”。思想上的“篱笆”扎得紧，资产阶级思想这只“野狗”就钻不进。我们必须注意，在夺权以后，很容易居功自傲，产生一种“舒舒服服闹革命”的倾向。“舒舒服服闹革命”，这是百分之百的修正主义，谁要这样滑下去，谁就会舒舒服服地“和平演变”。
    我们能把生活作风问题看成是无关紧要的小事吗？不，这不是小事。一个人的“和平演变”，往往是先从生活上打开缺口的。生活上闹点特殊化，就象是开了一个小洞，如果你不提高警惕，及时堵住它，资产阶级的风就会不断往里面吹，就会发展到不可收拾的地步。生活上的特殊化发展下去，就会舒舒服服地“修”掉。我们一定要在生活这一关上卡住资产阶级思想，与资产阶级思想作风作不调和的斗争。
    现在，有些革命委员会的成员和工作人员中，存在“五多”、“五少”现象。“五多”是：上主席台多，坐汽车多，蹲办公室多，看戏多，纪念章多；“五少”是：学习少，劳动少，参加斗批改少，接触群众少，革命造反精神少。这是值得引起严重注意的问题。这“五多”、“五少”说明了什么呢？说明了有的同志在生活上开始特殊化了，脱离群众，“官”气上来了，而不是以一个普通劳动者，即“老百姓”的面貌出现了。这是极其不好的苗头。发展下去是很危险的。
    有的同志有“过关”思想。总觉得自己在这次文化大革命中已经“杀”过来了，因此，思想上麻痹起来了，滋长了太平观念，放松了自己的思想改造。我们生活在阶级社会里，资产阶级思想时时会侵袭我们的头脑。脑子里的敌人，也是你不打，他就不倒的。你放松了跟他的斗争，他就会来进攻你，“吃”掉你。我们一定要以进攻的姿态去战胜资产阶级思想。因此，绝对不能有“过关”思想。改造思想，万万不能放松。我们要遵照林彪同志的指示，永远把毛主席的万古长青的光辉著作“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，学了就用，开展破私立公的斗争，搞好思想革命化。
    我们要珍惜上海无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，乘东风，鼓干劲，积极投入革命的大批判运动。在大批判、大斗争中，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。我们要紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟革命群众的革命性和创造性，把上海的大好形势再大大地往前推进一步。
