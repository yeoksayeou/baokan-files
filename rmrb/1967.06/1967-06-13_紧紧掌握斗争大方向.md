Chairman Mao teaches us: We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat must not only liberate itself but also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself.

Firmly Grasp the Direction of the Struggle

Hūhèhàotè (Hohhot) University and College Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Command

Looking back on a year of practice in the proletarian cultural revolution, we deeply feel that we must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution, always paying attention to grasping the direction of the struggle. What is the direction of the struggle in the proletarian cultural revolution? Chairman Mao tells us that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the main targets of the revolution are the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The contradiction between this handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. Exposing this handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, bringing out their revisionist goods for public display, thoroughly criticizing them, and overthrowing, smashing, and exposing them, and waging a struggle to seize power from them, this is the main problem that the proletarian cultural revolution aims to solve. This is the direction of the struggle.

In the early stages of the proletarian cultural revolution, we directed our struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Autonomous Region Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line they were implementing. At the same time, we also criticized those responsible who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes. However, the conservatives said we were attacking the proletarian headquarters, attacking the leftists. They directed their struggle against the broad revolutionary masses. Through our criticism and struggle, some comrades within the Autonomous Region Party Committee who had previously implemented the bourgeois reactionary line gradually recognized and corrected their mistakes, publicly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries. At this point, the conservatives immediately made a 180-degree turn, once again directing their struggle against the revolutionary cadres who had already stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, cursing them as the "ringleaders who incite the masses to fight the masses," and so on. As for those power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, they fiercely protected them.

Now, the class lines in the Inner Mongolia region are very clear. Although we still have serious tasks of struggle ahead, the situation of struggle is getting better and better. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, and complete the task of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. We deeply feel that to grasp the direction of the struggle, we must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works; not only must we learn to handle contradictions between the enemy and us, but we must also learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people. At any time, under any circumstances, we must not direct the struggle against the broad masses, against the broad cadres. For those who have been deceived, we must patiently and meticulously do political and ideological work with them, persuade them, educate them, and help them correct their mistakes, so that they can quickly return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We must unite all forces that can be united, expand the proletarian revolutionary front, and combine the criticism of the biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units and regions. We must promote the great unity of the revolutionaries and the "three-in-one combination" through the great criticism. Continuously raise our level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the Inner Mongolia region to the end.

    毛主席教导我们：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。
    紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    呼和浩特大中（专）院校红卫兵革命造反司令部
    回顾一年的无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，我们深深地感到必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的指示，时时刻刻注意掌握斗争的大方向。什么是无产阶级文化大革命的斗争大方向呢？毛主席告诉我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派同广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，把他们那套修正主义货色拿出来示众，彻底批判，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，对他们进行夺权斗争，这就是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要问题。这就是斗争的大方向。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，我们把斗争的矛头指向自治区党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们所执行的资产阶级反动路线，同时也批判那些执行过资产阶级反动路线的犯有错误的负责人。但是保守派却说我们是炮打无产阶级司令部，炮打左派。他们把斗争的矛头对准了广大的革命群众。经过我们的批判和斗争，自治区党委内的一些曾经执行过资产阶级反动路线的同志，逐步认识并且改正了自己的错误，公开站到无产阶级革命派一边来。这时，保守派马上来了个一百八十度的大转弯，一下又把斗争的矛头对准了已经站在无产阶级革命派这边的革命领导干部，大骂他们是什么“挑动群众斗群众的罪魁祸首”等等，而对于那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，他们却大保特保。
    现在，内蒙古地区的阶级阵线已经很清楚了。虽然我们面前还有严重的斗争任务，但斗争形势越来越好。我们一定紧紧掌握斗争大方向，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的任务。我们深深地感到要掌握斗争大方向，必须活学活用毛主席著作；不但要学会处理敌我矛盾，还要学会正确地处理人民内部矛盾。在任何时候，在任何情况下，都不能把斗争的矛头指向广大群众，指向广大干部。对于受蒙蔽的群众，一定要耐心地细致地向他们作政治思想工作，说服他们，教育他们，帮助他们改正错误，尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    我们要团结一切可以团结的力量，扩大无产阶级革命阵线，把批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派同本单位、本地区的斗、批、改结合起来。我们要通过大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。不断提高自己的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想水平，把内蒙古地区的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
