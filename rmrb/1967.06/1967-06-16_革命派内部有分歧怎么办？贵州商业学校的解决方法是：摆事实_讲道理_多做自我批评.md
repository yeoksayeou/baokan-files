	There are differing opinions and disagreements within the proletarian revolutionary faction. How should they be handled? The two combat teams of Guizhou Provincial Commercial School, following Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, presented facts, reasoned, and engaged in criticism and self-criticism. This led to a unified understanding and the realization of a revolutionary great alliance.

	In January, the revolutionary organization "September 5th" Combat Team within this school developed internal disagreements, leading some comrades to withdraw and form the "Spark of Fire" Combat Team. There was opposition between the two combat teams, and they even attacked each other, dispersing their fighting strength.

	From late February to early March this year, with the promotion of the experience of big alliances by departments in the Guiyang Cotton Mill and the emergence of the new situation of resuming classes and making revolution, the two combat teams began to discuss the issue of big alliances and decided to use democratic discussion and criticism and self-criticism to resolve contradictions within the revolutionary faction.

	However, at the beginning, both sides argued heatedly, each seizing on the other's shortcomings. The "Spark of Fire" Combat Team believed that the "September 5th" Combat Team had publicly proposed to seize the "handful" and "ambitious individuals" within "Spark of Fire," which was completely wrong. The "September 5th" Combat Team believed that the "Spark of Fire" Combat Team had long harbored strong sectarian and anarchist thoughts.

	It was clear that if both sides continued to argue in this manner, the disagreements would not only fail to be resolved but would instead grow larger. Therefore, everyone sat down to seriously study Chairman Mao's works. Based on Chairman Mao's teaching of "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, distinguishing right from wrong, and achieving new unity on a new basis," both sides used criticism and self-criticism as weapons to correct their attitudes in the debate. The "Spark of Fire" Combat Team comrades examined their own mistake of withdrawing from the "September 5th" Combat Team: due to the influence of sectarian and anarchist thoughts, they did not conduct comradely criticism of some shortcomings in the work of a few leaders of the "September 5th" Combat Team at that time, helping them to correct these shortcomings promptly, but instead pulled out to form another organization. At the same time, they criticized the "September 5th" Combat Team's few leaders for not trusting the masses, not relying on the masses, and arbitrarily labeling those who dared to raise sharp criticisms as "handful" and "ambitious individuals." The "September 5th" Combat Team, on the other hand, humbly accepted the criticisms, acknowledged their mistakes, and also seriously criticized the other side's sectarian and anarchist thoughts, pointing out the consequences of splitting, which weakened the fighting strength of the revolutionary faction. This was exactly as Chairman Mao said, "anarchist state does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people," and could only make the enemy happy.

	After more than a week of study and debate, both sides thoroughly criticized the "private" thoughts in their minds and used Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people to resolve the disagreements and contradictions between the two organizations. Everyone realized that to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, revolutionary organizations must only strengthen their fighting strength and not disperse or weaken it; each member of the revolutionary faction must only firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and not allow any private thoughts to exist or develop. After reaching a consensus in ideological understanding, the "September 5th" Combat Team and the "Spark of Fire" Combat Team achieved revolutionary great alliance in early March.

	Currently, this school has established a revolutionary committee based on class-level great alliances, including teachers in the leadership core groups of each class, to lead the resumption of classes and the making of revolution.

### 革命派内部有分歧怎么办？贵州商业学校的解决方法是：摆事实　讲道理　多做自我批评

    革命派内部有分歧怎么办？贵州商业学校的解决方法是：
    摆事实　讲道理　多做自我批评
    本报讯　无产阶级革命派内部有不同意见和分歧，怎么办？贵州省商业学校两个战斗队遵照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，摆事实，讲道理，开展批评自我批评，统一了认识，实现了革命的大联合。
    这个学校的革命组织“九·五”战斗队，一月间内部产生了分歧，一部分同志退出去，另外成立了“星星火”战斗队。两个战斗队之间存在着对立情绪，甚至互相攻击，分散了战斗力。
    今年二月下旬至三月初，随着贵阳棉纺厂按部门大联合经验的推广和复课闹革命的新形势的出现，这两个战斗队开始协商大联合的问题，决定用民主讨论和批评自我批评的方法，解决革命派内部的矛盾。
    但是，一开始双方争论很激烈，彼此抓住对方一些缺点不放。“星星火”战斗队认为：“九·五”战斗队曾经公开提出要抓“星星火”的“一小撮”和“野心家”，是完全错误的。“九·五”战斗队认为：“星星火”战斗队的小团体主义、无政府主义思想一直相当顽强。
    很明显，双方如果这样争论下去，分歧不但不会消除，反而会越来越大。于是大家坐下来认真学习毛主席著作。根据毛主席“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，分清是非，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的教导，双方以批评和自我批评为武器，端正了辩论的态度。“星星火”战斗队同志，检查了自己退出“九·五”战斗队的错误：由于小团体主义和无政府主义思想作怪，对当时“九·五”战斗队几个负责人工作中的一些缺点，没有进行同志式的批评，帮助他们及时改正，而是拉出去另外成立一个组织。同时，他们也批评了“九·五”战斗队少数负责人不相信群众，不依靠群众，给敢于提尖锐批评意见的人，乱扣“一小撮”、“野心家”的帽子。“九·五”战斗队一面虚心接受对方的批评，承认错误；同时对对方的小团体主义和无政府主义思想也提出了严肃的批评，指出分裂的后果，削弱了革命派的战斗力，这正如毛主席所说的“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望”，只能使敌人高兴。
    经过一个多星期的学习和辩论，双方狠革自己头脑中“私”字的命，用毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，解决了两个组织之间的分歧和矛盾。大家认识到，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，革命组织只允许增强战斗力，不允许分散和削弱战斗力；革命派每个成员只允许大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，不允许有私心杂念存在和发展的余地。在思想认识取得一致以后，“九·五”战斗队和“星星火”战斗队在三月初实现了革命的大联合。
    现在，这个学校在按班级大联合的基础上，成立了“三结合”的革命委员会，各班级也已建立了包括教师参加的领导核心小组，负责领导复课闹革命。
