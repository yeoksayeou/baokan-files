In the current struggle to the death between the oppressed classes and peoples of the world and imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, how should revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the world fight? At today's meeting commemorating the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," writers and friends from various countries responded loudly in their speeches: Revolutionary and progressive writers of the world must hold high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take up the pen as sword and spear, and join the fiery struggle. They must launch a massive attack against imperialism, a massive attack against revisionism, and a massive attack against all harmful elements, and carry the world revolution through to the end.

At the beginning of today's meeting, writers and friends from various countries waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly read aloud, "Resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, and be prepared to make any sacrifice." During the break of the discussion meeting, the international friends raised their arms and shouted, "Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified!" The entire venue presented a scene of "The four seas are churning with clouds and anger, and the five continents are shaking with thunder and lightning."

The Haitian writer Fidélia was the first to speak. He enthusiastically praised, "Chairman Mao's 'Talks' is an immortal work that, like a lighthouse, guides revolutionary writers and artists from all over the world to launch fierce attacks against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries."

Fidélia pointed out that we can only rely on the power of revolutionary armed forces to establish a government and open the road to the dictatorship of the proletariat, in order to create true art and create art that serves the fundamental interests of the masses.

The Niger friend Amada, in his speech, first shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Amada said, Chairman Mao Zedong is the great man who has comprehensively inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism and raised it to a new height, and is also the first person in the world to brilliantly create and develop proletarian literary theory by combining with the workers and peasants.

Amada said, Asian and African revolutionary writers must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight, to liberate the people of Asia and Africa from the rule of colonialism. We must bravely point our pens at the decadent literature of imperialism led by the United States, the new and old colonialism, and the traitorous literature of modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The Iranian writer Hosravi said, Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a landmark work and a sharp weapon. Once the proletariat arms itself with the "Talks," it will definitely be able to smash the entire imperialist, revisionist, and all reactionary literature.

He said, our era is the era of Mao Zedong Thought. In this era, the fighting task of writers and artists is to write about the true heroes of the people, write about the brave warriors of the proletariat, and express their revolutionary spirit and ideals, to inspire the people to revolution, smash imperialism and the reactionaries, and root out revisionism.

Hosravi said, Soviet modern revisionism has further exposed its ugly face in the face of the fighting people of Iran. Revolutionary Iranian writers are taking up their pens, breaking through the obstacles of imperialism, neo-colonialism, and revisionism, uprooting all weeds, and serving the revolution and the cause of people's liberation.

The Azanian (South Africa) friend Gola Ebrahim said, when American imperialism is carrying out naked aggression, its number one accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism, is also launching a massive attack on the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America on the cultural front, trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Revolutionary writers and people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must resolutely fight against revisionism in the anti-imperialist struggle.

Gola Ebrahim said, the people of Azania understand that power comes from the barrel of a gun, and revolutionary violence must be used against counter-revolutionary violence. We can only apply Mao Zedong Thought to our country to liberate our people, gain freedom, and achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Sri Lankan writer Manuvila spoke about the situation of progressive writers in Sri Lanka fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries based on Chairman Mao's teachings on revolutionary literature and art. He said, Chairman Mao is not only guiding the 700 million people of China but is also guiding the revolutionary people of the world to advance on the road of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is a great lighthouse that illuminates many dark corners of the world, making the oppressed people stand up resolutely to oppose imperialism and its number one accomplice—the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership.

He said, progressive and revolutionary writers in Sri Lanka have come to understand from Chairman Mao's teachings that anti-imperialism must be anti-revisionism, and the two cannot be separated. Revolutionary writers in Sri Lanka must expose the dirty tricks of modern revisionists trying to split our ranks and fight them to the end.

The Japanese friend Professor Inoue Seikyō said, Japanese revolutionary literary and artistic workers are taking "Talks" as the most correct and practical guiding theory for their literary, artistic, and cultural activities and putting it into practice.

Inoue Seikyō strongly condemned American imperialism for militarily invading Japan and extensively infiltrating decadent American culture into Japan, and condemned modern revisionism for colluding with American imperialism to spread poison in Japan. He said, while modern revisionism is crazily spreading its poison, a force opposing modern revisionism and upholding and insisting on the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary stance has also emerged and is rapidly growing in Japan. He said, the Japanese people strongly hope to be friendly with the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao Zedong. The ugly faces of the anti-China, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and anti-people revisionists of Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries have been continuously exposed in broad daylight.

The Tanzanian friends Abed Salim Awad and Said Salim Abdulla made a joint speech at the discussion meeting. They said, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks" has shown the way for all those who are determined to mobilize the oppressed people to rebel against all reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries, and is a powerful revolutionary weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat imperialist aggression, create revolutionary new culture, consolidate national independence, and advance towards socialism.

The joint speech said, now the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces in the world are engaged in a decisive struggle. In this struggle, revolutionary literary and artistic workers should seriously study and master Chairman Mao's "Talks," this powerful and sharp ideological weapon of the proletariat, to inspire the people to rebel and accelerate the complete failure of all reactionaries and the progress of humanity, and create a world without exploitation and oppression.

The joint speech said, revolutionary literary and artistic workers should not overlook the accomplices of imperialism when fighting against imperialism led by the United States. We must believe in the masses, expand the cultural united front against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The Chilean friend Paracios, in his speech, warmly hailed Comrade Mao Zedong's creative development of Marxism-Leninism, bringing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought, and praised Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks" as a powerful weapon for struggling for human liberation, smashing imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and fighting to build and consolidate a socialist society.

Paracios exposed and condemned the revisionists for joining the embrace of American imperialism, suppressing and deceiving the people of Latin America. He said, while we are fighting against American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, we must also fight against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. He condemned the revisionists of Chile for "cooperating" with American imperialism, creating public opinion for imperialism, and helping imperialism continue to suppress and destroy the revolution of the people of various countries in Latin America. He said, we must eliminate revisionism and its influence.

Paracios said, revolutionary literary and artistic workers must strive to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, learn the "Three Articles," establish a proletarian worldview, and combine with the broad masses of the people. They must go deep into the fiery struggle. He said, we are revolutionaries, soldiers of the proletarian cultural army. We will use the pen as a weapon to enlighten the masses and fight against our common enemies. We will build a powerful and resolute proletarian cultural army to help our people advance on the road of people's war against imperialism and feudalism. This road is illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong Thought will enable us to sweep away all the demons and monsters that exploit and oppress the people.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) friend Samuel Leo praised, in his speech, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has practiced Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary theory. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He said, once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful material force for transforming society and the world. The brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China fully prove this truth.

In his speech, he denounced the savage cultural aggression of imperialism and colonialism against the Congo (Brazzaville). He called on the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to unite and strive together to thoroughly uproot imperialism, colonialism, and all counter-revolutionary and anti-people cultures, and strive to create revolutionary culture.

The Chinese delegation member Jin Jingmai made a long speech at the discussion meeting. Based on the history of China's revolution and the development of revolutionary literature and art, he emphasized Chairman Mao's "Rebellion is justified," awakening the people to revolution, and turning the history overturned by the exploiting classes back over again. This is a great truth.

Jin Jingmai then spoke about the great significance of Chairman Mao's "Talks." He said, "Talks" is a brilliant work of epoch-making significance. It formulated for the first time the most complete, most comprehensive, most thorough, and most correct proletarian revolutionary literary line and the program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It declared all-out war on the old world, old culture, and old art.

Jin Jingmai said, the great call to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, issued by the great leader Chairman Mao, is the call to rebellion. The fire of revolution, the fire of rebellion, has completely burned down the throne of China's Khrushchev. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has created a more brilliant and powerful socialist China and has given the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world the strongest impetus. Now the world is entering a new era with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the masters, and a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

Jin Jingmai said, as the class struggle intensifies internationally, every Asian and African writer must make a historical choice: either to engage in a glorious struggle and wage an irreconcilable struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, or to compromise and willingly become a slave? We believe that the vast majority of revolutionary and progressive writers in Asia and Africa will become glorious rebels.

In his speech, Jin Jingmai strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for betraying the revolutionary people of the world and acting as accomplices of American imperialism. He said, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to deceive their own people and the people of the world and maintain their reactionary ruling position, crazily attacks the great Mao Zedong Thought and maliciously slanders Chairman Mao's great work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This further exposes the counter-revolutionary traitor face of the Soviet revisionists.

Jin Jingmai said, we rebels will not allow American imperialism to run rampant all over the world and let the Soviet revisionists sell out the people's revolutionary cause! We, the revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, are determined to carry the struggle between the two lines on the literary and artistic front to the end. We will stand firmly on the revolutionary position in this world-class class struggle, hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and march forward bravely. We will take up the pen as sword and spear and join the fiery liberation struggle of the Asian and African peoples, promoting the rapid development of the world revolutionary movement. We will vigorously promote the great Mao Zedong Thought, making the people awaken, inspire, and act, and wage a life-and-death struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and carry the world revolution through to the end!

Jin Jingmai said, Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time. It is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism. We must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, master the spirit of the "Talks," hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and become the first generation of revolutionary rebels in the world's literary and artistic ranks!

    拿起笔作刀枪，打倒帝修反！
    各国作家和朋友在讨论会上表示决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗把世界革命进行到底
    据新华社三日讯　在当前世界上被压迫阶级、被压迫人民同帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行的生死搏斗中，全世界革命的文艺工作者应该如何战斗？在今天的纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年讨论会上，来自各国的作家和朋友在发言中对此作出了响亮的回答：全世界革命的进步的作家必须高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，拿起笔作刀枪，投入火热的斗争，大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造一切害人虫的反，把世界革命进行到底。
    今天的大会开始时，各国作家和朋友挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，连续不断地齐声朗读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”讨论会休息时，各国朋友振臂高呼：“革命无罪，造反有理！”整个会场呈现一派“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”的景象。
    海地作家菲德利亚首先发言。他热情地赞颂说，毛主席的《讲话》这部不朽著作象灯塔一样，指引着全世界的革命作家和艺术家向帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派发起猛烈进攻。
    菲德利亚指出，我们只有依靠革命武装的力量建立起政权，打开通向无产阶级专政的道路，才能创造出真正的艺术，才能创造出为群众根本利益服务的艺术。
    尼日尔朋友阿玛达在发言的时候，首先用中文高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”阿玛达说，毛泽东主席是世界上第一个全面地继承、发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个新高峰的伟人，也是世界上第一个经过同工农群众相结合天才地创建和发展了无产阶级文艺理论的人。
    阿玛达说，亚非革命作家一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗进行战斗，使亚非人民从殖民主义的统治下解放出来。我们一定要把笔勇敢地指向以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义的腐朽文艺，指向以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的叛徒文艺。
    伊朗作家霍斯拉维说，毛主席的《讲话》是一部划时代的著作，是锐利无比的武器，无产阶级一旦用《讲话》把自己武装起来，就一定能够摧毁整个帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动的文艺。
    他说，我们的时代是毛泽东思想的时代。在这个时代里，作家和艺术家的战斗任务就是要写人民的真正英雄，写无产阶级英勇的战士，表现他们的革命精神和理想，鼓舞人民进行革命，摧毁帝国主义和反动派，根除修正主义。
    霍斯拉维说，苏联现代修正主义在战斗的伊朗人民面前进一步暴露了他们丑恶的嘴脸。革命的伊朗作家正在拿起笔，突破帝国主义、新殖民主义和修正主义的阻力，铲除一切毒草，为革命、为人民的解放事业服务。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）朋友高拉·易卜拉欣说，当美帝国主义正在进行赤裸裸的侵略时，它的头号帮凶苏联现代修正主义，也正在文化战线上向亚非拉人民大举进攻，他们企图扑灭亚非拉的革命烈火。亚非拉的革命作家和人民在反帝斗争中，必须坚决地同修正主义作斗争。
    高拉·易卜拉欣说，阿扎尼亚人民懂得，政权必须从枪杆子里面来，必须用革命的暴力对付反革命暴力。我们只有把毛泽东思想运用到我国，才能使我国人民获得解放，获得自由，获得无产阶级专政。
    锡兰作家曼努维拉在发言中谈到了锡兰进步作家根据毛主席关于革命文艺问题的教导，同帝国主义、修正主义和反动派进行斗争的情况。他说，毛泽东主席不仅正在指引七亿中国人民，而且在指引全世界的革命人民在反帝反修的道路上前进。毛泽东思想是伟大的灯塔，它照亮了世界许多黑暗的角落，使被压迫人民坚决站起来反对帝国主义和它的头号帮凶——以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    他说，锡兰革命和进步的作家从毛主席的教导中认识到，反帝必须反修，两者不能分割。锡兰革命作家一定要揭露现代修正主义者企图分裂我们队伍的肮脏勾当，同他们斗争到底。
    日本朋友井上清教授说，日本革命的文艺工作者正把《讲话》作为他们进行文学、艺术、文化活动的最正确、最有实践意义的指导理论，并付诸于实践。
    井上清强烈谴责美帝国主义对日本进行军事侵略并大肆向日本渗透反动的颓废的美国文化，谴责现代修正主义伙同美帝国主义在日本散布毒素。他说，在现代修正主义疯狂地散布其毒素的同时，在日本也同样出现了反对现代修正主义，拥护和坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命立场的力量，并在迅速成长。他说，日本人民强烈希望同毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民友好。日本、苏联和其他国家的修正主义者的反华、反毛泽东思想、反人民的丑恶面目已经不断暴露在光天化日之下。
    坦桑尼亚朋友阿贝德·萨里姆·阿瓦德和赛义德·萨里姆·阿卜杜拉在讨论会上作了联合发言。他们说，毛泽东同志的《讲话》，给一切有志于动员被压迫人民起来造一切反动派和反革命的反的革命者指明了道路，是全世界革命人民战胜帝国主义侵略，创立革命新文化，巩固民族独立和走向社会主义的强大的革命武器。
    联合发言说，现在世界上革命与反革命力量正进行一场决定性的斗争。在这场斗争中，革命的文艺工作者应该认真学习和掌握毛主席的《讲话》这一无产阶级的强大锐利的思想武器，去鼓舞人民起来造反，加速一切反动派的彻底失败和人类的进步，创立一个没有剥削和压迫的世界。
    联合发言说，革命文艺工作者在向以美国为首的帝国主义进行斗争时，切勿放过帝国主义的帮凶。我们必须相信人民群众，扩大反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的文化统一战线。
    智利朋友帕拉西奥斯在发言中，热烈欢呼毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段，赞颂毛主席的光辉著作《讲话》是争取人类解放，摧毁以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，为建设和巩固社会主义社会而斗争的强大武器。
    帕拉西奥斯揭露和谴责修正主义者投入美帝国主义怀抱，镇压和欺骗拉丁美洲人民。他说，我们在反对美帝国主义和各国反动派的同时，必须反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义。他谴责智利的修正主义者和美帝国主义“合作”，为帝国主义制造舆论，帮助帝国主义继续镇压和摧毁拉丁美洲各国人民的革命。他说，我们必须清除修正主义及其影响。
    帕拉西奥斯说，革命的文学艺术工作者为了完成自己的战斗任务，必须努力学习和运用毛泽东思想，学习“老三篇”，树立无产阶级世界观，必须和广大人民群众相结合，必须深入到火热的斗争中去。他说，我们是革命者，是无产阶级文化军队的战士，我们要以笔杆子当武器，去启发群众，反对我们的共同敌人。我们要建立一支强大的、坚定的无产阶级文化大军，以帮助我国人民走上反帝、反封建的人民战争道路。这条道路由毛泽东思想的光辉所照亮，毛泽东思想将使我们能够横扫一切剥削和压迫人民的牛鬼蛇神。
    刚果（布）朋友塞缪尔·勒奥在发言中赞扬说，史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，实践了毛泽东主席的革命理论，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他说，毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成改造社会和改造世界的强大物质力量。中国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉成就充分地证明了这一真理。
    他在发言中控诉了帝国主义、殖民主义对刚果（布）进行的野蛮的文化侵略。他呼吁亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民团结起来，共同努力，彻底铲除帝国主义、殖民主义以及一切反革命、反人民的文化，为创造革命的文化而努力奋斗。
    中国代表团成员金敬迈在讨论会上作了长篇发言。他根据中国革命和革命文艺发展的历史，着重地讲了毛主席的“造反有理”，唤醒人民起来革命，把剥削阶级颠倒的历史，重新颠倒过来的这一伟大真理。
    金敬迈接着谈到了毛主席的《讲话》的伟大意义。他说，《讲话》是一部具有划时代意义的光辉著作，它第一次制定了最完整、最全面、最彻底、最正确的无产阶级革命文艺路线和无产阶级文化大革命的纲领。它向旧世界、旧文化、旧艺术展开了全面的宣战。
    金敬迈说，由伟大领袖毛主席发出的要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大号召，是造反的号角。革命的烈火，造反的烈火，把中国的赫鲁晓夫的宝座彻底烧毁了。无产阶级文化大革命造出了更加灿烂、更加强大的社会主义中国，并给了全世界人民革命斗争以最有力的推动。现在世界正进入一个以工农兵为主人翁的新时代，进入一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    金敬迈说，随着国际上阶级斗争的激烈开展，每个亚非作家都必须作出历史的抉择：是进行光荣的战斗，向帝、修、反进行不调和的斗争呢？还是妥协，甘心情愿做奴隶？我们相信，亚非绝大多数革命的、进步的作家一定会做个光荣的造反派。
    金敬迈在发言中强烈谴责苏修背叛世界革命人民，充当美帝帮凶。他说，苏修领导集团为了欺骗本国和世界人民，维持其反动的统治地位，疯狂地攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，恶毒地诋毁毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这部伟大著作。这就进一步暴露了苏修的反革命叛徒嘴脸。
    金敬迈说，我们造反派，岂能让美帝在全世界横行霸道，让苏修出卖人民革命事业！我们亚非革命的进步的作家，决心要把文艺战线上两条道路的斗争进行到底。我们要在这场世界性的阶级大搏斗中站稳革命的立场，高举反帝反修的大旗，勇往直前。我们要拿笔作刀枪，投入亚非人民火热的解放战斗中去，推动世界革命运动的迅速发展。我们要大力宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，使人民觉醒起来，感奋起来，行动起来，同帝、修、反作殊死的战斗，把世界革命进行到底！
    金敬迈说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，它是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义的强大思想武器。我们一定要努力学习毛主席著作，掌握《讲话》精神，高举毛泽东文艺思想伟大红旗，做世界作家队伍中第一代响当当的革命造反派！
