	Look, the Soviet Revisionists Sell Out and Curry Favor with the U.S. Imperialists, Making Them Cheer Loudly
	Western newspapers hail the Kosygin-Johnson talks as evidence of "common interests" between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
	Western media say China's successful hydrogen bomb test makes the Soviet revisionist clique even more eager to ally with the U.S. against China

	BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) — Western newspapers, including those from the U.S. and Britain, have been lavishing praise on Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin for his visit to Johnson and his betrayal of the interests of the world's revolutionary peoples. They also reveal that this round of U.S.-Soviet global collusion is primarily aimed at China.

	In commenting on the meeting between the two countries' leaders, Western newspapers have been extolling the talks as having an "atmosphere of reconciliation," achieving "unexpected success," and being a "victory" for President Johnson.

	The New York Times boasted on June 24: "The meeting exceeded expectations. The length of time President Johnson and Premier Kosygin spent in talks, their agreement to continue the talks the next day at the same place, and their obviously pleasant demeanor as they left, all indicate that this was a constructive meeting." A Reuters dispatch on June 24 said: "The discussion lasted an astonishingly long time, and Kosygin himself proposed that they meet again. This is extremely encouraging." Western newspapers believe that the Kosygin-Johnson talks are of the same nature as the secret deals between Khrushchev and the U.S. imperialist leaders at Camp David and Vienna, marking a "new era" in U.S.-Soviet "relations."

	Western newspapers have made no secret of the fact that the Soviet revisionists' eagerness to collude with U.S. imperialism to jointly oppose China is a major reason for Kosygin's flattery and pandering to Johnson.

	The New York Times bluntly declared in a report, "Moscow is currently more concerned about the threat from Beijing than the threat from Washington. In preventing the expansion of Beijing's influence and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, they (referring to the U.S. and the Soviet Union) have common interests."

	Western newspapers generally believe that China's successful test of its first hydrogen bomb has "intensified" Moscow's "concerns," making the Soviet revisionist leadership even more terrified and eager to reach a deal with U.S. imperialism on a series of issues aimed at China, such as "preventing nuclear proliferation." A United Press International dispatch from New York on June 24 revealed that the Soviet revisionists are "praying" that the Kosygin-Johnson talks "will yield some positive results."

	Given Kosygin's performance in this round of talks with Johnson, fully displaying his servile attitude, Western newspapers generally believe that the agenda for future deals between the two sides is "wide open." A Reuters dispatch on June 24 reported: "The friendly atmosphere generated by this round of talks will undoubtedly encourage the two superpowers (referring to the U.S. and the Soviet Union) to ensure that the channels for discussion in the coming months are completely open." The Associated Press predicted, "Kosygin's invitation to Johnson to visit the Soviet Union one day seems almost certain."

    看，苏修卖身投靠使美帝大声喝彩
    美报大肆宣扬柯西金约翰逊会谈表明苏美有“共同利益”
    西方报刊说中国氢弹爆炸成功使苏修集团更加急于联美反华
    新华社二十五日讯　美英等西方报刊，纷纷为苏修头目柯西金登门求见约翰逊、当面出卖世界革命人民的利益而喝彩，同时透露这次美苏全球大勾结的矛头首先是针对中国的。
    西方报刊在评论这次苏美两国头目的会见时，大肆赞扬会谈“弥漫着和解的气氛”，“取得了出人意料的成功”，“对约翰逊先生来说是一个胜利”。
    《纽约时报》二十四日得意洋洋地写道：“会议超过了人们的期望。约翰逊总统和柯西金总理会谈时间之长，他们同意明天在同一地方继续进行会谈，和他们两人出来时的明显的愉快的神情，都说明了这是一次有建设性意义的会谈。”路透社二十四日的消息说：“讨论时间惊人的长，加上柯西金本人建议他们再次会谈，这是极其令人鼓舞的”。西方报刊认为，柯西金和约翰逊的会谈，是同当年赫鲁晓夫同美帝头子搞秘密交易的戴维营和维也纳会谈是“同一类的”。美苏“关系”进入了一个“新时代”。
    西方报刊毫不掩饰地指出，苏修急于要同美帝勾结共同反华，是这次柯西金对约翰逊如此奉承拍马，百般迎合的重要原因之一。
    《纽约时报》在一篇报道中露骨地宣称，“莫斯科目前对北京的威胁的担心超过了对华盛顿的威胁的担心。”“在制止北京影响的扩大和制止核武器扩散”方面，“他们（指苏美）是有共同利益的”。
    西方报刊普遍认为，中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，“加剧”了莫斯科的“担心”，更使苏修领导集团惊恐万状，急欲同美帝国主义在所谓“防止核扩散”等一系列矛头针对中国的问题上拍板成交。合众国际社二十四日发自纽约的一条消息透露，苏修“抱着祈祷的心情”，希望柯西金同约翰逊的会谈“能取得一些积极的结果”。
    鉴于柯西金在这次同约翰逊的会谈中，充分表现出了一副卖身投靠的奴才相，西方报刊在谈到美、苏全球大勾结的前景时，普遍地认为今后双方进行交易的“议程是大大地敞开的”。路透社二十四日报道说：“这次会谈产生的亲切的气氛，无疑将鼓舞两大国（指美苏）去设法使今后几个月里讨论的渠道完全畅通”。美联社预言，“柯西金向约翰逊发出某一天赴苏联访问的邀请，看来几乎是肯定的了”。
