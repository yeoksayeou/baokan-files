150,000 revolutionary masses and troops in Hohhot hold rally and demonstration march

The revolutionary masses and troops stationed in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held a rally and demonstration march on June 1, strongly protesting the fascist anti-China atrocities committed by the Mongolian revisionist authorities.

The attendees, both military and civilian, expressed their indignation by repeatedly shouting slogans such as: "Firmly support the May 27 statement by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs!" "Strongest protest against the Mongolian revisionists' bloody suppression of our diplomatic personnel and patriotic overseas Chinese!" "Down with the Mongolian revisionists, the running dogs of the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our great leader Chairman Mao!"

The representative of the Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Command of Hohhot's colleges and universities delivered the opening speech, angrily denouncing and strongly protesting the Mongolian revisionist authorities' despatch of large numbers of military and police to brutally beat, arrest, and detain our diplomatic personnel, Xinhua News Agency staff, and a large number of overseas Chinese. He said that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with! The Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world will settle accounts with the Soviet and Mongolian revisionists, who are colluding with U.S. imperialism, sooner or later.

Teng Haiching, the deputy commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and a member of the preparatory committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the rally. He pointed out that the barbaric and horrifying anti-China bloodshed incident on May 21 at the Ulaanbaatar station was not accidental. It was a criminal act organized and planned by the Mongolian revisionist ruling clique in accordance with the intentions of their Soviet revisionist masters. It was a criminal act carried out by the Mongolian revisionist ruling clique to meet the needs of the anti-China reverse current of U.S. imperialism. A small group of leaders of the Mongolian revisionists have played a shameful role in the international anti-China reverse current. They are nothing more than a jumping jester in the anti-China chorus of today's world imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries. Their arrogant anti-China actions go against the will of the people of the world and betray the Mongolian people. They will definitely meet a bad end! The arrogant anti-China actions of the Soviet and Mongolian revisionists will not harm a single hair of our great motherland. They are only lifting a stone to drop on their own feet. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The Soviet and Mongolian revisionists will not deviate from this logic either.

Teng Haiching emphasized that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is on the front line of the anti-revisionist struggle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is the fundamental strategic measure to prevent and combat revisionism. Only by carrying the Cultural Revolution in the Inner Mongolia region to the end can we thoroughly smash the Mongolian revisionists' illusions of restoring capitalism in Inner Mongolia.

Teng Haiching said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the staunch defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Inner Mongolia region firmly supports the solemn statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stands ready for battle, closely watches the enemy's actions, and is prepared to strike at any enemy who dares to invade.

Wu Tao, a member of the preparatory committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and political commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, and revolutionary cadre Gao Jinming also spoke at the rally. They pointed out that the Mongolian revisionist leadership clique closely follows the Soviet revisionists in their frenzied anti-China activities because they are afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China having a tremendous impact on the Mongolian people, fearing that the Mongolian people will rise up to rebel against them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably triumph." The great Mao Zedong Thought awakens the revolutionary people to rise up and rebel against the reactionary rule, and the call to "Rebellion is justified" shakes the world. No matter how the Soviet and Mongolian revisionists and any reactionaries try, they will never be able to stop the wheel of history from advancing.

Representatives of revolutionary workers who had aided Mongolia and returned, revolutionary herdsmen, revolutionary farmers, Red Guards, and representatives of revolutionary masses from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places also spoke, angrily denouncing the Mongolian revisionist authorities for following the Soviet revisionists in their anti-China actions and expressing their respect and learning from the anti-revisionist fighters among the overseas Chinese.

After the rally, a grand demonstration march was held.

    呼和浩特十五万革命群众和驻军举行集会和示威游行
    愤怒声讨蒙修当局猖狂反华的暴行
    滕海清、吴涛、高锦明和革命职工、牧民、农民、红卫兵代表等在会上讲话，严正指出：蒙修追随苏修在国际反华逆流中充当小丑，绝没有好下场
    新华社呼和浩特二日电　地处反修斗争第一线的内蒙古自治区首府——呼和浩特各族革命群众和驻内蒙古地区的中国人民解放军共十五万人一日举行集会，强烈抗议苏修走卒——蒙古修正主义当局的法西斯反华暴行。
    与会军民无比愤慨，不断振臂高呼：“坚决拥护我外交部五月二十七日的声明！”“最强烈抗议蒙修血腥镇压我外交人员和爱国华侨！”“打倒美帝的帮凶、苏修的走卒蒙修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    呼和浩特大中（专）院校红卫兵革命造反司令部革命小将代表致开会词，愤怒声讨和强烈抗议蒙修当局出动大批军警，野蛮地殴打、拘捕、扣留我外交人员、新华分社工作人员和大批华侨的法西斯暴行。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不是好惹的！中国人民和世界革命人民同勾结美帝的苏修、蒙修，早晚是要算总账的。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组负责人、中国人民解放军内蒙古军区代司令员滕海清在大会上讲话。他指出，五月二十一日蒙古修正主义当局在乌兰巴托车站制造的一场野蛮的骇人听闻的反华流血事件，不是偶然的，是蒙修统治集团秉承它的主子苏修统治集团的意旨，有组织有计划干出来的罪恶勾当，是蒙修统治集团为了适应美帝国主义的反华逆流的需要干出来的罪恶勾当。蒙修一小撮头头在国际反华逆流中，充当了一个可耻的角色，他们不过是当前世界上帝国主义、修正主义、一切反动派反华合唱队中的一个跳梁小丑。他们猖狂反华，违背了全世界人民的意愿，背叛了蒙古人民，他们一定没有好下场！苏修、蒙修的猖狂反华，无损于我们伟大祖国的一根毫毛。他们这样做，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”苏修、蒙修也决不会违背这个逻辑的。
    滕海清强调指出，内蒙古自治区处在反修斗争第一线。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是反修防修的根本的战略措施。只有把内蒙古地区的文化大革命进行到底，才能彻底粉碎苏修、蒙修妄图在内蒙古实现资本主义复辟的幻想。
    滕海清说，中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的坚强保卫者。驻内蒙古地区的中国人民解放军，坚决支持我国外交部的庄严声明，严阵以待，密切注视敌人行动，随时准备打击敢于来犯的敌人。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组负责人、内蒙军区政治委员吴涛，革命领导干部高锦明，也在会上讲了话。他们指出，蒙古修正主义领导集团紧紧地跟在苏修屁股后边疯狂地进行反华活动，是因为他们害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，害怕伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命在蒙古人民中产生巨大的影响，怕蒙古人民起来造他们的反。毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”伟大的毛泽东思想，唤醒了革命人民起来大造反动统治的反，“造反有理”的号召震撼着全世界，不管苏修、蒙修和任何反动派，绝对阻挡不了历史的车轮飞跃前进。
    曾经援蒙回国的革命职工代表、革命牧民代表、革命农民代表、红卫兵代表和在呼和浩特的首都、上海等地无产阶级革命派的代表，也讲了话，愤怒声讨蒙修当局追随苏修反华，并表示向华侨反修战士致敬和学习。
    大会结束以后，进行了声势浩大的示威游行。
