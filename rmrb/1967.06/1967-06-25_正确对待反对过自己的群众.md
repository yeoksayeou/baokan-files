How the proletarian revolutionary faction should handle those who have opposed them is an important issue in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary faction must seriously and properly address this issue.

Within our proletarian revolutionary faction, some comrades think that they are revolutionary pioneers who have emerged from class struggles. Under the white terror, they fear neither heaven nor earth and dare to engage in face-to-face struggles with all levels of capitalist-roaders within the Party. As a result, they gradually develop a sense of pride and self-satisfaction. They believe that they are the most advanced and revolutionary, and that others are not up to the mark. They view those who have joined the conservative faction as "political opportunists." They even consider doing ideological work with those in the conservative faction as "compromise," "mediation," or "soft-heartedness." These erroneous thoughts are highly detrimental to our efforts to unite the majority of the masses and cadres, and to concentrate our forces to attack the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself.

Regarding those who have been misled and opposed us, we must not treat them as enemies. They are mainly misled by the capitalist reactionary line, unable to see the situation clearly, and thus have taken a detour on the road to progress. As long as the revolutionary faction patiently does ideological work with them and helps them, they will quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The awakening of the masses varies in timing. We cannot label those who are misled and take longer to recognize their mistakes as "die-hard reactionaries" and strike them down. We also cannot label those who decide to join the revolution as "opportunists" and deny them the right to revolution. Revolution knows no precedence; as long as those who have been misled stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we revolutionary faction should enthusiastically welcome them and not hold past mistakes against them.

Within our revolutionary faction, we must frequently engage in active ideological struggles, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding and overcome various erroneous tendencies. This is how we can win over and unite the majority of the masses.

Those who have been misled do not understand the feelings of those who have been persecuted by the capitalist reactionary line. They cannot hate the capitalist reactionary line. To help these comrades raise their class consciousness, open their eyes, and distinguish right from wrong, we held several meetings to expose, criticize, and denounce the crimes of the capitalist reactionary line. This played a significant role in helping the misled comrades change their stance and draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line.

As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party frantically pushed the "strike a large area, protect a small area" capitalist reactionary line. At that time, out of the 204 people in our unit who participated in the movement, five "counter-revolutionary groups" were identified, and over 60 people were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," and "bad elements." The capitalist-roaders within the Party practiced bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary masses, persecuting them in every possible way.

These facts educated the misled comrades, helping them see more clearly the ugly face of the capitalist reactionary line. They spoke out what they had wanted to say but dared not. One comrade said, "During the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line, 'counter-revolutionary' hats were flying everywhere. I was afraid that one day it would land on my head. Even writing a big-character poster, I had to look at it again and again, fearing that I might make a mistake and be caught. This capitalist reactionary line must be overthrown."

Among the misled comrades, some were deeply poisoned and had done some wrong things with the capitalist-roaders within the Party. We exposed the true facts at the meetings, awakening these comrades. One comrade was very "brave" in attacking revolutionary masses and was once praised by the capitalist-roaders as a first-class cadre. However, because she had also said a few wrong words, black materials were secretly compiled and reported against her. When we exposed these situations, we always directed the criticism at the capitalist-roaders within the Party, not at the misled comrades. We deeply understood that although many misled comrades had attacked and insulted us at that time, the blame should not be placed on them but on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Because we paid attention to distinguishing between the two types of contradictions and strictly followed the Party's policies, the meetings to expose and criticize were held quite well. The misunderstandings between the revolutionary comrades and the misled comrades were eliminated. Everyone saw clearly that the root of the capitalist reactionary line lay with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Many misled comrades realized that they were both executors and victims of the capitalist reactionary line. They were very angry and, together with the revolutionary comrades, denounced the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They wrote big-character posters, expressing their determination to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many comrades announced their withdrawal from the conservative organizations at the meetings and made a dramatic turnaround.

In the past, during the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line, the misled comrades did not understand the feelings of those who were persecuted. Now that we proletarian revolutionaries are in power, we must understand the feelings of the misled comrades who have made mistakes. Through the meetings to expose and criticize the capitalist reactionary line, although many misled comrades have distinguished right from wrong, they still have different levels of psychological burdens. Therefore, we continued to do political and ideological work with them individually after the meetings.

At that time, a common concern among the misled comrades was the fear of being looked down upon and not daring to approach the revolutionary comrades. So, we studied Chairman Mao's words with them: "Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us a bit wiser. Our work is done better. Any party, any individual, errors are inevitable. We ask for fewer. Once errors are made, we ask for correction, the quicker and more thorough the better." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly inspired these comrades, and many of them voluntarily spoke their minds. One comrade, with tears in his eyes, said, "Through the days of exposing and denouncing the capitalist reactionary line, I realized I stood on the wrong side. I really want to join the revolutionary faction, but I'm afraid you won't accept me. I'm very troubled and hope you can pull me along." To such comrades, we gave them enthusiastic encouragement, maintained contact with them as much as possible, and continued to help them politically and ideologically. As long as they showed good performance, we praised them in time; for their shortcomings, we also made appropriate criticisms.

After a period of practice, we felt that having more individual talks with the misled comrades was very beneficial for winning them over and uniting them. Through individual talks, both sides spoke their minds, engaged in criticism and self-criticism, not only eliminating misunderstandings but also fostering revolutionary friendship. Some misled comrades talked with us until late at night, insisting on finishing what they had to say.

For those misled comrades who have changed, we trust them and truly treat them as a revolutionary force, letting them work freely. This is a great encouragement, and the vast majority work very well. For example, recently, several local material departments requested our support, so we boldly sent those who had been misled but had changed. They performed well in the intense class struggle there. After being tested, most of them were absorbed into the revolutionary mass organizations.

Over the past few months, because we paid attention to working with the misled comrades, we have won over and united the majority, creating a great situation of "revolutionizing and promoting production." In the future, we will continue to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, unite with all those who can be united, and complete the tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    正确对待反对过自己的群众
    毛泽东思想贵州省机电设备服务部革命委员会
    无产阶级革命派怎样对待反对过自己的群众，这是无产阶级文化大革命中的一个重要的问题，无产阶级革命派必须认真地、很好地加以解决。
    在我们无产阶级革命派内部，有的同志认为，自己是在阶级大搏斗中“杀”出来的革命闯将，在白色恐怖下，天不怕，地不怕，敢同党内大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派展开面对面的斗争，由此逐渐地产生了骄傲自满情绪。他们以为自己水平高，最革命，别人都不行，把那些反对过自己的同志起来革命看成是“政治投机”，甚至把对参加保守组织的群众作思想工作，也说成是搞“调和”、“折中”，是“温情主义”，等等。这些错误思想的存在，十分不利于我们团结群众和干部的大多数，集中力量向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火。
    毛主席教导我们：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。
    对于那些受了蒙蔽、反对过我们的同志，我们决不可以把他们当敌人看待。他们主要是受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，认不清形势，才在前进的道路上走了一段弯路。只要革命派耐心地去向他们做思想工作，帮助他们，他们就会很快地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    群众的觉悟有早有晚。我们决不能因为有些受蒙蔽的同志对自己的错误认识慢一些，就说他们是“死顽固”，把他们一棒子打死。也不能把想起来革命的同志说成是“投机”，不许人家革命。革命不分先后，只要受蒙蔽的同志站到毛主席的革命路线上来，我们革命派都应当热情地表示欢迎，并且既往不咎。
    在我们革命派内部经常开展积极的思想斗争，用毛泽东思想去统一大家的认识，克服各种错误思想倾向，才能争取和团结群众的大多数。
    受蒙蔽的同志不理解受资产阶级反动路线迫害的革命派同志的心情，他们对资产阶级反动路线恨不起来。为了帮助这些同志提高阶级觉悟，擦亮眼睛，分清是非，我们召开了几次揭发、批判、控诉资产阶级反动路线罪行的大会，这对争取受蒙蔽的同志转变立场，与资产阶级反动路线划清界限，起了很大的作用。
    无产阶级文化大革命刚一开始，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就疯狂地推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。当时，我们单位参加运动的二百零四人中，就被划了五个“反革命集团”，被打成“反革命分子”、“反党分子”、“坏分子”的达六十多人。党内走资本主义道路当权派对革命群众实行资产阶级专政，百般地进行迫害。
    这些事实，教育了受蒙蔽的同志，使他们更加看清了资产阶级反动路线的丑恶面目，说出了过去想说而不敢说的心里话。有个同志说：“在资产阶级反动路线实行白色恐怖的时候，‘反革命’帽子满天飞，我担心有一天会落到自己头上，写张大字报也要看了又看，恐怕有错被抓着辫子。这条资产阶级反动路线非打倒不可。”
    在受蒙蔽的同志中，有的同志中毒较深，跟党内走资本主义道路的当权派做过一些错事。我们就在大会上把事实真相公布出来，促使这些同志猛醒。有一个同志参加围攻革命群众很“勇敢”，走资本主义道路的当权派曾说她是一类干部，但是由于她平时也说过一句半句“错话”，也暗地里整理上报她的黑材料。我们在揭发这些情况的时候，始终把矛头对准走资本主义道路当权派，而不是对准受蒙蔽的同志。因为我们深深知道，尽管许多受蒙蔽的同志当时对我们进行了围攻、谩骂，但是，冤有头，债有主，这个账不应当记在受蒙蔽的同志的头上，而应当记到党内大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派的头上。
    由于我们注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，认真地按党的政策办事，所以揭发、批判大会开得比较好，革命派同志和受蒙蔽同志之间的隔阂消除了，大家都看清了资产阶级反动路线的总根子是在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派那里。不少受蒙蔽的同志看清了自己既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者又是受害者，都非常愤怒，和革命派的同志一起声讨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们纷纷写大字报，表示决心回到毛主席的革命路线上来。有不少同志在大会上宣布退出保守组织，大杀回马枪。
    过去，在资产阶级反动路线实行白色恐怖的时候，受蒙蔽的同志不理解受迫害同志的心情；现在，我们无产阶级革命派掌权了，我们就要理解受蒙蔽犯错误同志的心情。通过揭发、批判资产阶级反动路线大会，虽然受蒙蔽的许多同志分清了是非，但是他们还有轻重不同的思想包袱。因此，我们又在会后找他们个别谈心，继续对他们作政治思想工作。
    当时，在受蒙蔽的同志中间，比较普遍的一种思想顾虑是怕别人看不起，不敢主动接近革命派的同志。于是，我们就和他们一起学习毛主席的这段语录：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”毛主席的教导，使这些同志受到了很大的启发，很多人都主动地谈出了心里话。有个同志含着眼泪说：“通过几天的揭发、控诉资产阶级反动路线大会，我知道自己站错了立场，我很想参加革命派，怕你们不要，思想上很苦恼，希望你们能拉我一把。”对这样的同志，我们都热情地予以鼓励，尽可能同他们保持接触，继续从政治思想上帮助他们。只要他们有好的表现，我们都及时予以表扬；对他们的缺点，也适当地提出批评。
    经过一段时间的实践，我们觉得，多和受蒙蔽的同志个别谈心，对于争取和团结他们很有好处。因为通过个别谈心，彼此都说出心里话，相互开展批评和自我批评，不但能够消除隔阂和误会，而且能够增进同志之间的革命友谊。有些受蒙蔽的同志和我们谈心，谈到深夜三点多还不肯走，非要把心里话说完不可。
    对于已经转变的受蒙蔽的同志，我们都相信他们，把他们真正当成革命的一份力量来使用，放手让他们去工作。这对他们是很大的鼓舞，绝大多数人工作得很好。例如，前不久，几个地方的物资部门要求我们派人去支援，我们便大胆地派那些过去受蒙蔽、已有转变的同志去。他们到了那里，在激烈的阶级斗争中都表现得很好。经过考验，大都被吸收参加了革命群众组织。
    几个月来，由于我们比较注意做受蒙蔽同志的工作，争取和团结了大多数，“抓革命，促生产”出现了一派大好形势。今后，我们决心继续遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，高举革命的批判大旗，团结一切可以团结的人，胜利地完成一斗、二批、三改的任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
