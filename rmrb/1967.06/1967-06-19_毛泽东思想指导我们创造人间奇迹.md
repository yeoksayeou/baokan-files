Our country's first hydrogen bomb explosion was successful, marking a significant leap in the development of our nuclear weapons and indicating that our national defense science has entered a new stage. It has dealt a heavier blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries—the arrogant "heroes" who are frenziedly opposing China—and has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of the world. Excellent! Wonderful! We, the entire cadre and soldier contingent guarding the coastal defense, along with all the cadre and soldiers of the entire army, and with the revolutionary people of the entire country and the world, are celebrating and cheering with the utmost enthusiasm: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our dearest, reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle on earth can be created." People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle on earth. Today, the successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb is a brilliant victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb. As long as we turn Mao Zedong Thought into our soul, we can transform the spiritual atomic bomb into a material atomic bomb. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can reach the moon in the sky and catch turtles in the depths of the ocean. Any enemy, any difficulty, is nothing to us. Those who once mocked us, history has and will continue to mock you mercilessly. Remember, the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, this pair of nuclear bullies, sang in unison, waving their nuclear weapons to oppress the people everywhere, acting as if anyone who did not kneel before them would be crushed to pieces. Indeed, some spineless fellows knelt down and betrayed. But the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the hardest bones; they are towering revolutionary heroes. From the bottom of their hearts, they see through the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries as nothing but paper tigers, with no real power. The true strength belongs to the people. The successful explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb once again demonstrates the brilliance of this great scientific principle. It has, with the most persuasive facts, completely shattered the imperialists' and revisionists' nuclear monopoly dream.

"Only the people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history." The successful explosion of our country's hydrogen bomb is another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which believes in, relies on, and respects the creative spirit of the masses the most.

We, the revolutionary soldiers guarding the coastal defense, are cheering for victory. We extend our highest respect and warmest congratulations to our comrades who are fighting on the front lines of national defense science and have participated in the successful explosion of this hydrogen bomb in various aspects of the work! We must humbly learn from you, learn from your unparalleled loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought, learn from your spirit of studying Chairman Mao's works actively in struggle, further promote our ideological revolutionization, and firmly grasp our weapons, ready at any time to annihilate any enemy who dares to invade.

    毛泽东思想指导我们创造人间奇迹
    战斗英雄　舒积成
    我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功了，它是我国核武器发展的一个飞跃，标志着我国国防科学的发展进入一个崭新的阶段。它给了帝修反——猖狂反华的
  “英雄好汉”们一次更沉重的打击，给了全世界革命人民以巨大鼓舞。好得很，好极了！我们守卫在海防前线的全体指战员和全军广大指战员一起，和全国全世界革命人民一起，最热烈地庆祝，最热烈地欢呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是能够创造任何人间奇迹的人。今天我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，正是伟大的毛泽东思想的辉煌胜利。光焰无际的毛泽东思想就是威力最大的精神原子弹，只要把毛泽东思想化为我们的灵魂，就能使精神原子弹转化为物质原子弹。毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖。任何强敌，任何困难，都统统不在话下。那些曾经嘲笑过我们的蠢驴们，历史已经并且还将更无情地嘲笑你们。想当初，美帝和苏修这一对核霸王，一唱一和，拿着核武器到处欺压人民，不可一世，好象谁要不跪倒在他们脚下，就要粉身碎骨。果然有一些软骨头的家伙，跪下了，叛变了。但是，毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，骨头是最硬的，是顶天立地的革命英雄汉。他们从骨子里看穿了帝修反统统不过是纸老虎，并没有什么了不起的力量，真正强大的力量属于人民。我国第一次氢弹爆炸成功，又一次显示了这一伟大的科学原理的光辉。它以最雄辩的事实，彻底打破了美帝苏修核垄断的迷梦。
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我国氢弹爆炸成功，正是毛主席最相信最依靠人民群众，最尊重人民群众首创精神的无产阶级革命路线的又一个伟大胜利。
    我们守卫在海防前线的革命战士们，在热烈欢呼胜利声中，特向战斗在国防科学第一线、参与这次氢弹爆炸成功的各方面工作的同志致以最崇高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺！我们一定要虚心地向你们学习，学习你们无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的高贵品质，学习你们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的精神，进一步促进我们的思想革命化，更牢地握紧手中武器，随时准备消灭胆敢来犯的敌人。
