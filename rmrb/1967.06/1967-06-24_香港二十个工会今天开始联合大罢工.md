Under the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Launch a New High Tide of Anti-British Struggle
Twenty Trade Unions in Hong Kong Begin Joint Strike Today
Mobilize the Masses, Strengthen the People’s Power, and Double the Blow to the Heinous British Imperialism
Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots and Workers from All Trades Express Resolute Support for the Joint Strike

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 23rd—The Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of twenty trade unions in Hong Kong’s maritime, land, and water transport, public utilities, shipyards, textile industry, and other sectors issued the “Joint Strike Announcement to All Workers” in the afternoon of the 23rd. The announcement solemnly declared that starting from June 24th, a joint strike will be launched to initiate a new high tide of anti-British resistance, resolutely and bravely giving the heinous British imperialists a double blow. It was also declared that the enemy must be annihilated, and if the British do not bow down, they must perish!

The full text of the “Joint Strike Announcement to All Workers” is as follows:

We fully support and respond to the great call of our motherland, “Resolutely counter the provocations of British imperialism!”

We resolutely support and respond to the battle cry of the Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of all trades, “Double the retaliation, escalate the anti-oppression struggle!”

We solemnly declare that starting from June 24th, workers from Hong Kong buses, Kowloon buses, taxis, trucks, trams, Oil Street ferries, tugboats, lighters, cargo handling, cargo workers, Kowloon Dock, Yuen Yick Dock, Taikoo Dock, Hong Kong Electric, Kowloon Electric, telephone, Taikoo Dockyard, Kowloon Dockyard, and major textile mills in Hong Kong and Kowloon will jointly go on strike! We will join the heroic milk workers, Star Ferry workers, gas workers, maritime workers, postal workers, water workers, and all departments of the “Hong Kong Government” in a united struggle. We will resolutely and bravely give the heinous British imperialists a double blow! We must annihilate the enemy! If the British do not bow down, they must perish!

We solemnly swear: We must fully mobilize the masses, strengthen the people’s power, and carry the anti-British resistance struggle to the end! We will not retreat until we achieve complete victory!

For more than a hundred years, British imperialism has been riding roughshod over us, acting arrogantly and oppressing the working class and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon with extreme cruelty. In the past decade, the British, in collusion with the American and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, have split the workers, ruthlessly exploited them, and plunged the vast majority of workers into poverty. Recently, they have become even more frenzied in their national oppression, continuously expanding their bloody suppression. Thousands of compatriots have been illegally arrested, beaten, and sentenced. Our brothers Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming have been beaten to death and shot! Can we sit idly by and watch our worker brothers being oppressed and slaughtered? Can we sit idly by and watch our compatriots being beaten and tortured in prison? No, a thousand times no, a million times no! We must settle old and new grievances with the British! The blood of our compatriots cannot be shed in vain. We must avenge the martyrs who have died!

In the past, our predecessors in the Hong Kong-Canton Strike wrote a magnificent chapter in the history of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people’s anti-imperialist struggle. Today, we, the Chinese workers of Hong Kong armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will follow the teachings of Chairman Mao: “Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.” We will inherit this glorious revolutionary tradition and continue to write this great chapter in the history of the Chinese people’s anti-imperialist struggle.

Our struggle is a patriotic anti-British struggle. Any Chinese person with blood and patriotism has the responsibility to join this great struggle and temper themselves in the struggle. We must dare to struggle and dare to win. We must neither believe the “sweet words” of imperialism nor fear its threats. We are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon. In the face of national dignity, we can die, we can shed blood, but we must never lose our dignity! We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the anti-imperialist patriotic mass movement, persist in the struggle, and resist the British to the end!

Due to the British imperialists’ bloody suppression, the nature of the struggle has already changed to a struggle against British oppression. This joint strike of ours is aimed at the British imperialists, not at those who are engaged in legitimate business. On the contrary, we hope that all legitimate and patriotic businesspeople will unite and jointly fight against the British, defend the dignity of our motherland, and protect their legitimate rights and interests.

The current anti-British resistance struggle is in a great situation! The workers of the entire Hong Kong have united! The farmers and fishermen of the New Territories have united! Patriotic intellectuals and students have united! Street vendors have united! Patriotic women compatriots have united! Patriotic businesspeople and compatriots from all walks of life have united! A mighty anti-British resistance army has been developed, launching powerful counterattacks against British imperialism in the political, economic, and cultural spheres. Now, the British imperialists are already in a state of panic, running around frantically. Although they will make their last struggles, their days are numbered. Under our strengthened unity and persistent struggle, with the support of 700 million people of our motherland, with the support of the invincible People’s Liberation Army, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the day of executing the British imperialists will surely come!

The British will definitely be defeated, and we will definitely be victorious!
Long live the victory of the Hong Kong and Kowloon workers’ joint strike!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

June 23, 1967

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 23rd—The Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of various trades in Hong Kong and Kowloon issued statements this afternoon, expressing resolute support for the workers who are at the forefront of the anti-British resistance struggle and are carrying out the joint strike. They called on compatriots from all walks of life to unite and launch a powerful assault on British imperialism.

The statement from the Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon said: “We have said before that if the British authorities escalate their atrocities, our resistance will also escalate. The British imperialists’ brutal national oppression has ignited the anti-resistance tide of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. People from all sectors and industries have organized and taken action; this grand-scale joint strike is to retaliate against the British authorities’ continuous bloody suppression, to resist British imperialism’s brutal national oppression, to defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to settle the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong, and to avenge the three martyrs, Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming! Our struggle is just, our struggle is aimed at British imperialism, and we hope that all patriotic compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon will use various forms of struggle to support this joint strike, unite, and launch a powerful assault on British imperialism together.”

The statement hopes that all businesspeople in Hong Kong and Kowloon will understand that this is a struggle to defend the dignity of the Chinese nation, see the great situation of the current anti-British resistance movement, and support or sympathize with this joint strike. The statement pointed out that the losses suffered by the employers due to the strike should be compensated by British imperialism. A small group of traitors who dare to help British imperialism suppress and sabotage this strike will surely be severely punished.

The statement from the Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of various trades in Hong Kong and Kowloon pointed out: The fate of Hong Kong lies in the hands of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. The workers from various trades who control Hong Kong’s maritime rights, land rights, and economic lifelines are bravely and unyieldingly fighting against British imperialism with great courage. They are practicing their solemn oath. They are inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the Hong Kong-Canton Strike. They are indeed good soldiers loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought. Their heroic struggle has set a brilliant example for the working class of the entire Hong Kong! We once again pay tribute to them! We resolutely support their struggle.

The statement strongly warns British imperialism: Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon will definitely settle all the heinous crimes you have committed in Hong Kong and give you the punishment you deserve! The more you suppress, the closer your end in Hong Kong will be!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起反英抗暴新高潮
    香港二十个工会今天开始联合大罢工
    放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，加倍打击万恶的英帝国主义
    港九各界同胞和各业工人表示最坚决支持联合大罢工
    新华社香港二十三日电　香港海运、水陆交通、公共事业、船坞、纺织业等二十个工会的反对港英迫害斗争委员会，在二十三日下午发表《联合大罢工告各业工友书》，庄严宣告从六月二十四日起举行联合大罢工，掀起一个反英抗暴的新高潮，坚决地、勇猛地给万恶的港英帝国主义以加倍的打击，并且表示一定要致敌死命，港英不低头，就要它灭亡！
    《联合大罢工告各业工友书》的全文如下：
    我们一万个拥护，一万个响应祖国的伟大号召，“坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅”。
    我们最坚决拥护、响应各业工人斗委会“加倍还击，把反迫害再升一级”的战斗号召！
    我们庄严宣告，从六月二十四日起，香港巴士、九龙巴士（注：香港称公共汽车为巴士）、的士（注：即出租汽车）、货车、电车、油麻地渡海小轮、拖船、趸船、轮船起落货、理货员、九龙仓、均益仓、太古仓、香港电灯、九龙电灯、电话、太古船坞、九龙船坞及主要纱布厂等各业工人联合大罢工！与英雄的坚持斗争的牛奶工人、天星渡海小轮工人、煤气工人、海事署工人、邮务工人、水务工人以及“港府”各部门职工大会师并肩战斗。坚决地、勇猛地给予万恶的港英帝国主义加倍打击！我们一定要致敌死命！港英不低头，就要它灭亡！
    我们庄严宣誓：我们一定要放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，把反英抗暴斗争进行到底！不获全胜，绝不收兵！
    一百多年来，港英帝国主义骑在我们头上，作威作福，对我港九工人阶级和爱国同胞进行残酷压迫。近十多年来，英帝更勾结美帝蒋帮，分裂工人，惨剥工人，使我广大的工人群众陷于贫困的境地。最近以来，更疯狂地对我进行民族压迫，不断扩大血腥镇压，上千的同胞被非法逮捕、毒打、判刑，我们的兄弟徐田波、黎松、曾明已被活生生打死和枪杀！我们能坐视我工人兄弟受迫害、受屠杀吗？能坐视我同胞在狱中被毒打、被折磨吗？不能，一千个不能，一万个不能，冤有头，债有主，新仇旧恨，我们必须跟港英清算！我们同胞的鲜血不能白流，我们一定要为死难的烈士报仇！
    当年省港工人大罢工，我们的前辈已为中国工人阶级和中国人民写下了一首反帝斗争的壮丽的史诗。今天，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国工人，一定要遵照毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”继承这个光荣的革命传统，续写这部中华民族反帝斗争的伟大诗篇。
    我们的斗争是一场爱国反英的斗争，任何一个有血性、有民族感的中国人，都有责任投身到这场伟大的斗争中去，并在斗争中锻炼自己。我们要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。既不相信帝国主义的
  “好话”，也不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。我们无限忠于毛主席，忠于光焰无际的毛泽东思想，忠于港九爱国同胞。在民族大义面前，头可断，血可流，中国人民尊严绝不可丢！我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开展反帝爱国的群众运动，坚持斗争，反英抗暴到底！
    由于英帝的血腥镇压，斗争的性质早已转变为反对港英迫害的斗争，我们这次的联合大罢工，斗争的锋芒是针对英帝，并不针对那些正当的工商业者，相反，我们是希望一切正当的和爱国的工商业者，联合起来，共同向英帝进行斗争，维护祖国的尊严，维护自己的正当权益。
    目前的反英抗暴斗争是一片大好形势！全港工人团结起来了！新界农民、渔民兄弟团结起来了！爱国的知识分子和青年学生团结起来了！小贩同胞团结起来了！爱国的妇女同胞也团结起来了！爱国工商业者以及各个阶层的爱国同胞团结起来了！一支浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴大军已经发展起来，在政治、经济、文化各个方面向港英帝国主义发动了强大的反击。现在港英帝国主义已经焦头烂额，疲于奔命，虽然它们还要作最后挣扎，但它们的寿命已经不长了。在我们加强团结，坚持斗争之下，在七亿祖国人民支持下，在攻无不克的解放军支持下，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，判处港英帝国主义的死刑，这个历史性的日子一定要到来！
    港英必败，我们必胜！
    港九工人联合大罢工胜利万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！

        一九六七年六月二十三日
    据新华社香港二十三日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和港九各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会，今天下午分别发表声明，向站在反英抗暴斗争最前线进行联合大罢工的工人兄弟，表示最坚决的支持，号召各界爱国同胞联合起来，一齐向英帝国主义进行猛烈的冲击。
    港九各界斗委会的声明说：“我们早就说过，港英当局的暴行升级，我们的抗暴斗争也就要升级。港英帝国主义残酷的民族压迫，已经激起了港九同胞的抗暴怒潮，各界各行各业人士都纷纷组织起来，行动起来；而这次轰轰烈烈的大规模的联合罢工，是为了对港英当局不断进行血腥镇压的加倍还击，是为了反抗英帝国主义残酷的民族压迫，是为了捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是为了清算英帝国主义在香港犯下的滔天罪行，是为了替徐田波、黎松、曾明三位死难烈士报仇！我们的斗争是正义的，我们斗争的矛头是针对港英帝国主义的，我们希望港九各阶层各界一切爱国同胞们，要用各种各样的斗争方式来配合这次联合大罢工，联合起来一齐向英帝国主义进行猛烈的冲击。”
    声明希望港九所有工商业人士，要理解这是为了维护中华民族尊严的一场斗争，要看清目前的反英抗暴运动是一片大好形势，要赞助或同情这次联合大罢工。声明指出，资方由于大罢工而遭受的损失，应由英帝国主义负责赔偿。一小撮民族败类如敢帮助英帝国主义镇压和破坏这次大罢工，必将受到严厉的惩罚。
    港九各业工人斗委会的声明指出：香港的命运取决于香港爱国同胞。掌握着香港海权、陆权和香港经济命脉的各业工人兄弟，以大无畏的气概，前赴后继地向着港英帝国主义展开英勇不屈的斗争。头可断，血可流，中国人民尊严不可丢。他们正在实践自己的庄严誓言。继承和发扬省港大罢工的光荣传统。他们不愧为忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想的好战士。他们的英勇斗争为全港工人阶级树立了一个光辉的榜样！我们再一次向他们致敬！我们坚决支持他们的斗争。
    声明强烈警告英帝国主义：在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下的港九爱国同胞，一定要彻底清算你们在香港犯下的滔天罪行，一定给你们应有的惩罚！你们越疯狂镇压，你们在香港的末日也就越临近！
