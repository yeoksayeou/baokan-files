Officers and soldiers of the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the PLA listened to China's first proletarian symphony, "Shajiabang," with great joy and held a discussion. They enthusiastically praised the symphony "Shajiabang," which was composed with Mao Zedong Thought.

A Vivid Lesson in Mao Zedong Thought

Zhao Shixiang (Soldier): The proletarian revolutionaries of the Central Orchestra, following Chairman Mao's instructions, took up the iron broom and swept the ghosts and monsters of China and the West off the symphony stage, making workers, peasants, and soldiers the masters of the symphony stage. This is a great innovation!

I have listened to a symphony before, but I couldn't understand it at all. The symphonies of the past were all bourgeois decadent music, which had nothing in common with us proletarian revolutionary fighters.

This time, listening to the symphony "Shajiabang," not only could I understand it, but I also received a vivid lesson in Mao Zedong Thought. "Shajiabang" is permeated with a red line of Mao Zedong Thought, singing the glorious victories of Mao Zedong Thought. After listening to the symphony "Shajiabang," I further understood that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party and our army were able to defeat the Japanese imperialists with superior equipment with inferior equipment, relying on Chairman Mao's great thought of people's war.

Zhou Kaicheng (Deputy Squad Leader): After listening to the symphony "Shajiabang," I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for a long time. Guo Jian'guang, Ah Qing, and other heroic figures shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought deeply educated me. They were lenient to themselves and ruthless to the enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation was, they always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and relied closely on the masses to defeat the cunning and evil class enemies time and time again. I must learn from these heroic figures.

Zhou Jinqiu (Deputy Political Instructor): The authors of the symphony "Shajiabang" stood on the proletarian standpoint, correctly depicted the revolutionary war, and sang the praises of the great War of Resistance Against Japan, fully embodying Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of people's war. After listening to the performance, one feels inspired and full of fighting spirit, naturally thinking of the current domestic and international class struggle situation. As a soldier of the People's Liberation Army of China, I deeply feel the great responsibility I have.

Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ascend the Symphony Stage

Zhou Jinqiu: When the performance of the symphony "Shajiabang" began, the curtain opened, and the stage was full of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The performers wore the clothes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, sang the songs of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and created the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The facts have proven that the symphony from the West, after revolution, can be completely utilized and accepted by workers, peasants, and soldiers. The bourgeois gentlemen say: "The symphony is ours! Not yours!" We say: "The symphony is created by the people. In the past, it was stolen by you bourgeois gentlemen and used to poison the working people. Today, we revolutionary people, armed with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely smash the rotten stuff of the bourgeoisie and revisionism, and let the symphony return to the hands of the proletariat and the working people, forever serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers!"

Zeng Fuxing (Soldier): I have never listened to a symphony before. This time, I listened to the symphony "Shajiabang" and understood it completely! Why? Because the symphony "Shajiabang" propagates Mao Zedong Thought and uses the musical language of the working people. It is our workers, peasants, and soldiers' symphony. Zhou Yang and other small cliques of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles say: "To make peasants understand the symphony, they must improve for twenty years first." Your symphony that propagates bourgeois thoughts and feelings, we working people don't like it at all, don't want to accept it at all, and don't want to understand it at all. But a workers, peasants, and soldiers' symphony like "Shajiabang," we working people like it and understand it immediately!

The symphony "Shajiabang" portrays the heroic images of workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the scene "Persist," at the critical moment, Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Protracted War" appears on the stage, and the music gives strong support, creating the heroic image of people's soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, unyielding and determined to fight the enemy to the end, symbolizing that Mao Zedong Thought will definitely defeat all enemies! In the "Finale," the brass instruments play a powerful melody, with the momentum of "millions of heroic troops crossing the Yangtze River," deeply infecting me. I feel as if I am also charging towards the enemy with the red flag! The clear bugle call inspires me. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must definitely overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party!

The Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Line

Liu Ruizhong (Platoon Leader): Chairman Mao teaches us that art serves politics. The symphony "Shajiabang" is a model of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, depicting the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics.

In the seventeen years since the founding of the nation, under the support of the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mihan, and Xia Yan, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, have pushed a thick and long revisionist literary and artistic black line in the literary and artistic field, stubbornly resisting Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and performing Chinese and Western ghost and monster plays. They used the symphony to fiercely oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Central Orchestra, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, bravely attacked bourgeois symphony music. After many struggles with the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, they finally broke through numerous obstacles, defeated the desperate counterattacks of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and successfully created and performed the epoch-making symphony "Shajiabang." We hail the birth of the symphony "Shajiabang" and the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Zhang Jutang (Class Leader, Five Good Soldier): The symphony "Shajiabang" is a powerful cannon shot at the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and its backstage boss. When we criticized the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, we listened to this proletarian symphony shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, which further strengthened our fighting spirit! We must seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    欢呼用毛泽东思想谱成的交响音乐
    ——解放军某部四连干部、战士座谈革命交响音乐《沙家浜》
    解放军某部四连部分干部、战士怀着万分喜悦的心情，听了我国第一部无产阶级的交响音乐《沙家浜》，并进行了座谈。他们热烈赞扬用毛泽东思想谱成的交响音乐《沙家浜》。
              一堂生动的毛泽东思想课
    赵士祥（战士）：中央乐团的无产阶级革命派按照毛主席的教导，举起铁扫帚，从交响音乐舞台上扫除了中国和西方的牛鬼蛇神，让工农兵成为交响音乐舞台上的主人。这个创举真是好得很！
    以前我听过一次交响乐，可怎么也听不懂。过去的交响乐都是资产阶级的靡靡之音，这样的交响乐和我们无产阶级革命战士没有一点共同语言。
    这次听交响音乐《沙家浜》，不仅能够听懂，而且从中受到了一次生动的毛泽东思想的教育。《沙家浜》贯穿着一条毛泽东思想的红线，歌颂了毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。听了交响音乐《沙家浜》，我进一步领会到，在抗日战争时期，我党我军所以能够以劣势装备战胜优势装备的日本帝国主义，靠的就是毛主席伟大的人民战争的思想。
    周凯清（副班长）：听完交响音乐《沙家浜》，我激动得久久不能入睡。郭建光、阿庆嫂，这些闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄形象，深深地教育了我。他们对己和，对敌狠，不管在任何艰难困苦的场合，总是时刻牢记毛主席的教导，紧紧依靠人民群众，一次又一次地战胜了刁猾凶恶的阶级敌人。我一定要向这些英雄人物学习。
    周近秋（副指导员）：交响音乐《沙家浜》的作者，站在无产阶级的立场上，正确地描写了革命战争，歌颂了伟大的抗日战争，充分地体现了毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想。听完演奏后，使人意气风发，斗志昂扬，很自然地联想起目前国内外的阶级斗争形势。作为中国人民解放军一名战士，深感自己责任的重大。
        工农兵登上了交响音乐舞台
    周近秋：交响音乐《沙家浜》演出开始，幕一拉开，满台都是我们工农兵，演员穿的是工农兵的衣服，唱的是工农兵的歌声，塑造的是工农兵的英雄形象。
    事实证明，来自西方的交响乐经过革命以后，是完全可以为工农兵所利用，为工农兵所接受的。资产阶级的老爷们说：“交响乐是我们的！不是你们的！”我们说：“交响乐是人民创造的，过去被你们这帮资产阶级的老爷们窃为己有，利用它来毒害劳动人民。今天，我们革命人民奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，一定要砸烂资产阶级、修正主义那一套破烂，让交响乐回到无产阶级和劳动人民的手里，永远为工农兵服务！”
    曾福兴（战士）：我从来没有听过交响乐。我第一次听交响音乐《沙家浜》，就完全听懂了！为什么呢？因为交响音乐《沙家浜》宣传的是毛泽东思想，用的是我们劳动人民的音乐语言，是我们工农兵自己的交响乐。周扬等文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子说：“要想农民听懂交响乐，必须等农民提高二十年再说。”你们那套宣扬资产阶级思想感情的交响乐，我们劳动人民压根儿就不喜欢它，压根儿就不愿意接受它，压根儿就不想去听懂它。而象《沙家浜》这样的工农兵交响乐，我们劳动人民就是喜欢它，就是一听就懂！
    交响音乐《沙家浜》表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵的英雄形象。《坚持》一场，在关键时刻，舞台上出现了毛主席的光辉著作《论持久战》，音乐给以强有力的烘托，塑造了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士坚强不屈、与敌人决战到底的英雄形象，象征着毛泽东思想必将战胜一切强敌！在“终曲”里，铜管乐器奏出强有力的曲调，那种“百万雄师过大江”的气势，深深地感染着我，我好象也跟着红旗冲向敌群！嘹亮的军号声激励着我，在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒！
        毛主席革命文艺路线的胜利
    刘瑞忠（排长）：毛主席教导我们，艺术是为政治服务的。交响音乐《沙家浜》就是一部模范地贯彻毛主席的指示，表现工农兵斗争生活，为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的交响音乐。
    建国十七年来，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，陆定一、周扬、林默涵、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子在文艺领域里推行了一条又粗又长的修正主义文艺黑线，他们顽固地对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，大演特演中国和西方的牛鬼蛇神戏。他们利用交响音乐猖狂地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。中央乐团的无产阶级革命派，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的领导下，勇敢地起来向资产阶级交响音乐进攻。他们经过同反革命修正主义文艺黑线的多次搏斗，终于冲破了重重阻力，战胜了一小撮反革命修正主义分子的疯狂反扑，成功地创作和演出了具有划时代意义的交响音乐——《沙家浜》。我们欢呼交响音乐《沙家浜》的诞生，欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉胜利！
    张聚堂（班长、五好战士）：交响音乐《沙家浜》是射向反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台的一枚强有力的炮弹。我们在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的时候，听到这部闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级交响乐，更加增强了斗争的勇气！我们一定要认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
