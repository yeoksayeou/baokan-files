Qiu Guomin, who was once deceived, has awakened. His awakening is a victory for the revolutionary faction in using Mao Zedong Thought to conduct detailed ideological work on him. It is also a victory for the revolutionary faction in grasping the overall direction and uniting the majority.

Some class brothers once opposed the proletarian revolutionary faction because they were deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line. Since they were deceived, we must conduct thorough and detailed ideological work to help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and join us in the revolution, advancing together. The proletarian revolutionary faction should become the proletarian politicians that Chairman Mao expects, who are "good at uniting those who have opposed us and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes."

The proletarian revolutionary faction should learn to master the skills of doing mass work. There are still many class brothers like Qiu Guomin who have been deceived and need our help. We should strive in this regard!

    做好深入细致的思想工作
    受蒙蔽的邱国民觉醒了。他的觉醒是革命派用毛泽东思想对他进行细致的思想工作的胜利，也是革命派掌握大方向、团结大多数的胜利。
    一些阶级兄弟，曾经反对过无产阶级革命派，那是因为他们受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽。他们受了蒙蔽，我们就要做深入细致的思想工作，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和我们一起革命，共同前进。无产阶级革命派应该成为毛主席所期望的“善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”的无产阶级政治家。
    无产阶级革命派应当学会做群众工作的过硬本领，现在还有不少象邱国民那样受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟，需要我们去帮助他们。我们应当在这方面努力！
