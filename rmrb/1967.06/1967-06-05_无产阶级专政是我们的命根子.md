The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party’s ranks, in his book *Self-Cultivation*, most viciously opposes proletarian dictatorship.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Proletarian dictatorship is something that the victorious people cannot for a moment be without, just as they cannot be without clothing, food, and shelter. It is a good thing, a talisman for self-protection, a family heirloom. Until imperialism abroad and reactionaries at home are completely and thoroughly eliminated, this talisman must never be discarded.”

Why did we workers suffer so much in the old society? Why did we have no political status? Why were we hungry and cold? In one word, it was because we did not hold political power. After liberation, we workers have stood up, gained political status, and economic security, all because we hold political power.

*Self-Cultivation* is divorced from the actual class struggle, and it does not mention the issue of proletarian dictatorship. This book was published during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but it does not mention the class struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan; it was reprinted during the War of Liberation, but it does not mention the class struggle during the War of Liberation, and it opposes the proletariat seizing political power through violence; it was reprinted during the socialist revolution, but it does not mention the class struggle in socialist society, which is still a matter of political power. All this is for what purpose? It is to prevent the proletariat from seizing and consolidating political power; it is to allow the bourgeoisie to seize political power and realize a capitalist restoration.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party’s ranks is terrified at the mere mention of proletarian dictatorship. When he quotes Lenin, he repeatedly omits the phrase “proletarian dictatorship.” This is to uproot our proletarian lifeline!

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party’s ranks opposes proletarian dictatorship and wants bourgeois dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Whatever the enemy opposes, we support.” The more the enemy opposes proletarian dictatorship, the better it is! Proletarian dictatorship is our talisman for self-protection and our family heirloom. We cannot be without it for a moment. Without it, we workers will suffer again, the enemy will return, millions of heads will roll, and China will change color. We must follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, firmly grasp the talisman of proletarian dictatorship, until classes are completely, thoroughly, and entirely eliminated, until the whole world enters communism.

    无产阶级专政是我们的命根子
    上海国棉一厂织布挡车工　杨富珍
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》，最恶毒的地方就是不要无产阶级专政。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：无产阶级专政“对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”我们工人在旧社会为啥那样受苦？为啥政治上没地位？为啥吃不饱，穿不暖？一句话，就是因为我们没有掌握政权。解放后，我们工人翻了身，政治上有了地位，经济上有了保障，就是因为我们掌握了政权。
    《修养》脱离现实的阶级斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题。这本书在抗日战争时期出版，不谈抗日战争时期的阶级斗争；在解放战争时期再版，不谈解放战争时期的阶级斗争，却反对无产阶级用暴力夺取政权；在社会主义革命时期再版，不谈社会主义社会里的阶级斗争仍然是政权问题。所有这些都是为的啥？为的是不让无产阶级夺取政权，巩固政权；为的是让资产阶级夺取政权，实现资本主义复辟。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一看到无产阶级专政这几个字，就怕得要死。他在引用列宁的话时，一再把无产阶级专政的字样剜掉。这是剜掉我们无产阶级的命根子！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反对的是无产阶级专政，要的是资产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。敌人越是反对无产阶级专政，说明无产阶级专政就是好，好得很！无产阶级专政是我们的护身宝、传家宝，我们一刻也离不开它。离开了它，我们工人就要吃二遍苦，敌人就要卷土重来，千百万人头就要落地，中国就要改变颜色。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，紧紧地掌握无产阶级专政这个法宝，直到彻底地干净地全部地消灭阶级，直到全世界进入共产主义。
