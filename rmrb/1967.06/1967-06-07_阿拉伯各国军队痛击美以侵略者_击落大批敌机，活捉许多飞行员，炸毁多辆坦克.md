In the aftermath of the large-scale aggression launched by U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, Arab countries have been fiercely fighting on all fronts, inflicting heavy blows on the U.S.-Israeli aggressors.

According to a nighttime battle report issued by the Supreme Command of the United Arab Republic's (UAR) Armed Forces on the 5th, after intense battles, UAR forces repelled an Israeli attack on the Kontera area in the Sinai Peninsula and launched a counteroffensive, entering Israeli-occupied territory and capturing enemy positions.

Kontera was one of the key targets of Israel's aggression against the UAR's Sinai region. In this attack, Israel deployed an entire brigade and thirty tanks. UAR forces bravely fought back, destroying most of the invading tanks and eliminating enemy reinforcements brought in by helicopters.

In the areas west of Kontera, Abu Agila and Quseima, UAR forces are also engaged in fierce battles with the invading enemy forces, resisting their advances.

In the Gaza Strip along the Mediterranean coast, Palestinian Liberation Army forces and local residents are bravely resisting the invading Israeli forces.

Meanwhile, UAR Air Force has been continuously deploying aircraft to support ground troops on various fronts and bombing Israeli military bases and positions in the south, shooting down nine enemy aircraft.

On the 5th, Israeli aircraft continuously bombed UAR military bases near Cairo and on the east bank of the Nile throughout the night. UAR Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units bravely intercepted, shooting down a large number of enemy aircraft and capturing many enemy pilots.

According to a statement from the Syrian military, Syrian forces launched an attack on Israel on the morning of the 6th, capturing the Shuri Esh Shek Plain north of Hulah. Syrian Air Force also deployed aircraft to bomb Israeli airports, strategic positions, and military forces. Israeli airports in the north were heavily bombed, with most Israeli aircraft destroyed. The Syrian Air Force also bombed Israel's Haifa refinery, causing it to catch fire.

On the 6th, Israeli aircraft continuously invaded Syrian airspace, bombing Syrian airports and other locations. Syrian Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units bravely intercepted, shooting down more than ten Israeli aircraft. The Syrian Minister of Defense issued a statement calling on the people to capture enemy pilots who have fallen in Syrian territory and hand them over to the military or public security authorities.

According to a broadcast by Baghdad Radio, Iraqi forces are advancing into the Palestinian interior, which has been invaded by Israel. Iraqi Air Force deployed aircraft to bomb Israel's Sherkin Airport, destroying seven enemy aircraft. Iraqi aircraft also strafed Israeli anti-aircraft positions.

On the 6th, Jordanian forces continued to shell Israeli positions north of Tel Aviv and engaged in fierce street battles with Israeli forces in Jerusalem. On the 5th, Jordanian forces captured Muqabel Hill in Jerusalem, destroying thirteen Israeli tanks.

The Supreme Command of the UAR Armed Forces issued a statement at 18:00 on the 6th, pointing out that although Israel has suffered serious losses in aircraft and tanks, it still has a large number of air forces that can be deployed in battle. This is because U.S. and British imperialism are continuously providing reinforcements and conducting large-scale aerial interventions.

    阿拉伯各国军队痛击美以侵略者
    击落大批敌机，活捉许多飞行员，炸毁多辆坦克
    新华社开罗六日电  在美帝国主义及其工具以色列发动大规模的侵略以后，阿拉伯国家在各个战线上奋勇作战，给美—以侵略者以沉重的打击。
    据阿联武装部队最高司令部五日深夜发表的战报宣布，阿联军队经过激烈的战斗，粉碎了以色列对西奈地区孔蒂拉的进攻后，主动转入反攻，进入了被以色列侵占的领土，并攻占了那里的敌军阵地。
    孔蒂拉是以色列发动侵略后，向阿联西奈地区发动进攻的重要目标之一。以色列在这次进攻中出动了一个整旅和三十辆坦克。阿联军队英勇作战，击毁了入侵的大部分坦克，并消灭了由直升飞机运来增援的敌军。
    在孔蒂拉西北的阿布奥格拉和柯赛伊马，阿联军队也正与分路入侵的敌军队作战，抵抗敌军的进攻。
    在地中海边的加沙地带，巴勒斯坦解放军和当地居民也正在英勇地抗击入侵的以色列军队。
    与此同时，阿联空军不断出动，支援各个战线上的地面部队的作战，并轰炸以色列南部的敌军机场和阵地，击落敌机九架。
    以色列飞机五日彻夜不断轰炸开罗附近和尼罗河东岸的阿联军事基地，阿联空军和高射炮部队奋勇迎击，击落大批敌机，活捉许多敌机飞行员。
    据叙利亚军方宣布，叙利亚军队六日清晨开始向以色列发动进攻，攻占胡拉海北面的舒里埃舍克平原。叙利亚空军也出动飞机轰炸以色列的机场、战略据点和军队。以色列北部的机场受到猛烈的轰炸，机场上的以色列飞机大部分被炸毁。叙利亚空军还轰炸了以色列的海法炼油厂，使炼油厂起火。
    以色列飞机六日不断侵入叙利亚领空，轰炸叙利亚机场和其他地方。叙利亚空军和高射炮部队奋勇迎击，击落十多架以色列飞机。叙利亚国防部长发表声明，号召人民活捉落在叙利亚境内的敌机飞行员，并把他们绑交军队或公安部门。
    据巴格达电台广播，伊拉克部队正向被以色列侵略的巴勒斯坦内地挺进。伊拉克空军出动飞机轰炸以色列的谢尔金机场，炸毁了七架敌机。伊拉克飞机还扫射了以色列的高射炮阵地。
    约旦军队六日继续炮轰特拉维夫以北的以色列阵地，并在耶路撒冷城里与以色列军队进行剧烈的巷战。约旦军队在五日攻占耶路撒冷的穆卡贝尔山时，击毁了十三辆以色列坦克。
    阿联武装部队最高司令部六日十八时发表公报指出，尽管以色列在飞机和坦克方面已遭到严重损失，以色列目前还能有大量空军投入战斗，这是因为美、英帝国主义不断给予补充和进行大规模的空中干涉。
