China's successful detonation of its first hydrogen bomb has left the U.S. and British imperialists in a state of shock. They have come to realize that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have developed and mastered nuclear weapons at an astonishing speed. This is another severe blow to the U.S. imperialists' policy of nuclear blackmail and to the grand conspiracy hatched by the U.S. and British imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership to oppose the people of the world.

News from Washington indicates that the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Defense were all stunned by the news of China's successful hydrogen bomb test. Two days after the test, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, in a state of unease, cursed China's development of nuclear weapons as "a very unfortunate thing." Some U.S. newspapers were forced to admit that the rapid development of China's nuclear technology had "startled" U.S. officials and caused "political shockwaves."

According to reports from London, the British government, in its dismay, actually expressed "regret" over China's successful hydrogen bomb test. The Foreign Office spokesman on June 19th, in revealing this anti-China stance, also betrayed the British rulers' despair at China's defiance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed by the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Many bourgeois newspapers in the U.S. and Britain have acknowledged that China's rapid progress in nuclear weapons development has disrupted the timetable of Washington and Moscow's counter-revolutionary activities, catching the U.S. and Soviet rulers off guard. On June 18th, *The Times*' correspondent in Washington, McDonald, said that China's hydrogen bomb test had "upset" the U.S. military's "timetable." The same day, an editorial in *The Sunday Telegraph* stated: "It has always been clear that China would eventually become a nuclear power; but the dreaded day has come much sooner than the Americans had anticipated." On June 19th, *The Daily Express* said: "The timing of China's first hydrogen bomb test, just as the United Nations General Assembly debate is about to begin, has left the Americans and Russians in an awkward position." On June 19th, the *International Herald Tribune* anxiously pointed out that for "the rest of the world," China's successful hydrogen bomb test had "shocking implications."

An editorial in the *Daily Mirror* on June 19th admitted that China's hydrogen bomb test had left the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union—the three members of the "hydrogen bomb club"—stunned and worried. They were surprised because they had originally thought that it would take China at least two more years to produce a hydrogen bomb. They were worried because the test was a major blow to the delicate nuclear balance maintained by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

According to reports, in a desperate attempt to maintain the nuclear monopoly of the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and to jointly oppose China, the U.S. ruling class is plotting to seize the opportunity of Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin's attendance at the UN General Assembly special session to further negotiate with the Soviet revisionists on the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty." On June 19th, United Press International reporter Hansley reported that U.S. officials had publicly stated that China's hydrogen bomb test "showed the need for greater progress in U.S.-Soviet talks on limiting the spread of nuclear weapons." The same day, *The New York Times* more blatantly advocated that the "two superpowers have the responsibility to prevent the unlimited spread of nuclear weapons."

    红色氢弹一声巨响　美英苏修目瞪口呆
    美英报刊哀叹中国核武器飞速发展打乱美苏搞反革命勾当的时间表
    新华社二十日讯　中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，使美、英帝国主义大为震惊。它们明白：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民以异乎寻常的速度掌握和发展核武器，这对于美帝国主义的核讹诈政策，对于美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团合谋策划反对世界人民的大阴谋，是又一个沉重的打击。
    来自华盛顿的消息表明，美国白宫、国务院和国防部被中国氢弹爆炸成功的消息震动得目瞪口呆。美国国务卿腊斯克在中国氢弹爆炸成功后两天，心神不安地咒骂中国发展核武器是“非常不幸的事”。一些美国报纸被迫承认，中国核技术的高速度发展使美国官方“吓了一跳”，“引起了政治震动”。
    据伦敦消息，英国政府在沮丧之余，居然对中国氢弹的爆炸成功表示“遗憾”。这个政府的外交部发言人十九日在表明这种敌视中国的态度时，还流露了英国统治者对中国敢于蔑视美英苏三国部分禁止核试验条约而感到绝望的悲哀。
    美国和英国的许多资产阶级报纸都承认，中国在发展核武器方面的飞速进展，打乱了华盛顿和莫斯科从事反革命勾当的时间表，使美苏统治者措手不及。《泰晤士报》驻华盛顿记者麦克唐纳十八日说，中国的氢弹爆炸“推翻了”美国军事计划的“时间表”。同一天，《星期日电讯报》的社论说：“中国终究要成为一个核大国，这一点始终是很清楚的；可是，可怕的日子来得比美国人预料的还要早得多。”《每日快报》十九日说：“中国的第一枚氢弹爆炸的时间正好是联合国大会辩论就要开始的时候，这使美国人和俄国人都感到狼狈。”美国《国际先驱论坛报》十九日不安地指出，对“世界其他地方”来说，中国的氢弹爆炸成功“有其令人震惊的影响”。
    英国《每日镜报》十九日刊登的一篇评论承认，中国的氢弹爆炸“使美国、英国和俄国——氢弹‘俱乐部’的三个成员——感到惊异和担忧。它们之所以感到惊异，是因为它们原先认为，中国至少还得花两年时间才能制造出氢弹来。而它们之所以担忧，则是因为这次爆炸对于美俄两国微妙地保持着的核均势是一个巨大打击。”
    据报道，为了拚命保住美苏两个核霸王的核垄断地位和联合反华，美国统治集团正阴谋抓紧苏修头目柯西金出席联大特别会议的机会，同苏修在所谓“防止核扩散条约”问题上进一步做交易。合众国际社记者汉斯莱十九日报道透露，美国官员公开表示，由于中国试验氢弹成功，“说明有必要使苏美在限制核武器扩散问题上的会谈取得更大的进展”。同一天的《纽约时报》更露骨地鼓吹美苏“两个超级大国有责任防止核武器的无限制扩散”。
