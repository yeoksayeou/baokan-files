On June 3, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 67 Middle School, along with the PLA soldiers stationed at the school for military training, set out on foot to Yongfeng Commune's Tundian Production Brigade in Haidian District, carrying their luggage. Upon arriving in the village, they studied Chairman Mao's "The Orientation of the Youth Movement." Everyone resolved to truly unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, to live, eat, and labor with them, and dispersed to live in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Have Deep Class Feelings for Classmates
	Living in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the students were deeply moved by the meticulous care they received. Chen Peiyun's landlady, Grandma Zhou, often got up in the middle of the night to cover the students with blankets and fumigate mosquitoes. Every day when the students returned from work, Grandma Zhou had already prepared hot water for them. When the students thanked her, she said, "This is what I should do. Didn't Chairman Mao teach us to love and help each other?" The students were deeply moved and felt ashamed when they reflected on their own behavior. Chen Peiyun said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants care for us so much and study Chairman Mao's works so well. We fall far short. Among classmates, a small disagreement leads to arguments and even labeling each other. Instead of uniting and being close to classmates who have been misled and made mistakes, we exclude and attack them. This shows a lack of class feelings. We should learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, be patient in helping classmates who have been misled, and always care for, be close to, and unite with them, so we can advance together!"

	Be Thrifty and Revolutionize Like the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
	Living and laboring with the poor and lower-middle peasants is a good opportunity to learn from them. Over fifty-year-old Brigade Leader Fan often worked from early morning to late evening. When the students asked him, "Aren't you tired working so hard for the brigade?" He smiled and pointed to Chairman Mao's portrait, saying, "Chairman Mao is over seventy years old and worries so much about state and world affairs. What's a little worry for the collective? Studying Chairman Mao's works isn't just about talking; it's about doing." He cherished the brigade's property. The students often saw him tying up broken ropes and mending torn sacks to reuse. Poor peasant Zhang often wore a patched shirt. When the students asked him, "Uncle Zhang, why don't you wear new clothes and only wear old ones?" Uncle Zhang held up his copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said, "Chairman Mao calls on us to 'be thrifty and revolutionize.' We mustn't forget the past! If we cultivate the habit of being thrifty and plain-living, we can save wealth for the state and support socialist construction!" These things deeply moved the students. At a discussion meeting, Jia Hongli said excitedly, "The poor and lower-middle peasants are thrifty and plain-living, think of the whole, and act in the people's interests. This is truly worth our serious learning. In the past, when writing big-character posters, we all wanted to use new paper and didn't want to use old paper. For propaganda, we insisted on using loudspeakers. This is all wrong. In the future, we must be like the poor and lower-middle peasants, carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, and establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the revolution."

	Put the Propagation of Mao Zedong Thought First
	As soon as the revolutionary teachers and students entered the village, they actively helped the village write Chairman Mao's quotations, create blackboard newspapers, and teach revolutionary songs. They studied Chairman Mao's works and central documents with the commune members, always putting the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought first. They said, "No matter how much support and help, letting the poor and lower-middle peasants grasp Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support and help." On June 7, it was raining, and the roads were slippery. However, the propaganda team composed of students, to let the poor and lower-middle peasants hear Chairman Mao's voice as soon as possible, braved the rain and came to Tundian. At the edge of the rice fields in Tundian Village, four old men were pulling up rice seedlings. As soon as they saw the propaganda team, they were overjoyed, clapping their hands and saying, "You truly deserve to be Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, bringing the performance to the fields!" They sang "Chairman Mao is the Reddest Red Sun in Our Hearts" for the four old men. When they sang, "Chairman Mao is the sun, shining wherever he goes," one old man excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is warmer than the sun. The sun can only shine on us, but Chairman Mao's words warm our hearts."

	After a few days of labor training, the revolutionary teachers and students learned a lot of good thoughts, styles, and qualities from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The phenomenon of endless arguments over minor issues between revolutionary cadres, revolutionary organizations, and revolutionary teachers and students disappeared. They saw the direction of the struggle clearly and strengthened proletarian feelings. They resolved to unite under the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to tightly combine the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their school with the great criticism of the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the Party, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂
    ——记北京市第六十七中学革命师生在夏收第一线
    六月三日，北京市第六十七中学的革命师生，和驻校帮助军训的解放军同志一起，背着行李，步行来到海淀区永丰公社屯甸大队。他们进村后，就学习了毛主席的《青年运动的方向》。大家决心真正和贫下中农打成一片、和贫下中农实行“三同”，就分散住到贫下中农家里。
    对同学要有深厚的阶级感情
    住在贫下中农家中，贫下中农无微不至的关怀，使同学们很受感动。陈佩云的房东周大娘，经常半夜起来给同学们盖被子、熏蚊子。每天收工回来，大娘早把开水准备好了。同学们感谢她时，她却说：“这是我应该做的，毛主席不是教导我们互相爱护、互相帮助吗？”同学们听了非常激动，他们联想到自己，感到非常惭愧。陈佩云说：“贫下中农对我们这样关心爱护，学习毛主席著作学得这么好。我们做的差远了，同学之间有点小分歧，就吵就闹，甚至乱扣帽子，对受蒙蔽、犯了错误的同学，不是团结他们，亲近他们，而是排斥打击。这就是缺乏阶级感情。我们要向贫下中农学习，对受蒙蔽的同学要耐心地帮助，要处处关心、亲近他们，团结他们，和我们一起前进！”
    象贫下中农那样节约闹革命
    和贫下中农实行“三同”，是向贫下中农学习的好机会。五十多岁的队长范大爷每天早出工晚下工。同学们问他：“你为队上这样操心不累吗？”他笑着指指毛主席像说：“毛主席他老人家七十多岁了，每天为国家大事、世界大事操多大心。咱为集体操这点心算什么！咱学习毛主席著作，不光说在口上，还要做在手上。”他非常爱惜队上的东西。同学们经常看到他把队上拉断了的绳套，一条条结起来，经常把队上破了的口袋，拿回家补好再用。贫农张大爷穿着一件破汗衫，补了好多补钉。同学们问他：“张大爷，你为什么不穿新的，光穿破的呢？”张大爷把手里的《毛主席语录》一扬说：“毛主席号召咱们‘要节约闹革命’。咱可不能忘记过去呀！咱平时养成艰苦朴素的习惯，就能为国家节约财富，支援社会主义建设呀！”这些事情，同学们看在眼里，记在心里，每个人都受到深刻的教育。在讨论会上，贾鸿利同学激动地说：“贫下中农处处勤俭节约，艰苦朴素，从全局着想，从人民的利益出发，真值得我们认真学习。我们过去，在写大字报时，都争用白纸，不愿用废纸，做宣传一定要用大喇叭，这都不对。今后我们一定要象贫下中农那样，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，树立一心为革命的思想。”
    把宣传毛泽东思想放在首位
    革命师生一进村，就主动地帮助村里写毛主席语录，写黑板报，教唱革命歌曲。他们和社员们一起学习毛主席著作和中央文件，处处把宣传毛泽东思想放在首位。他们说：“千支援，万帮助，让贫下中农掌握毛泽东思想是最大的支援、最大的帮助。”六月七日，天下着雨，道险路滑。可是，同学们组成的宣传队，为了尽快地让贫下中农听到毛主席的声音，冒雨来到屯甸。屯甸村边稻田里有四个老大爷正在拔稻秧，一看到宣传队来了，乐的合不上嘴，一边拍手一边说：“你们真不愧是毛主席的红小兵，把节目送到田间来啦！”他们给四个老大爷唱了《毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳》。当唱到“毛主席是太阳，照到那里那里亮”时，一个老大爷激动地说：“毛主席比太阳温暖，太阳只能照在咱身上，毛主席的话句句暖在咱心窝里。”
    广大革命师生经过短短几天的劳动锻炼，学到不少贫下中农的好思想、好风格、好品质。革命师生和革命干部、革命组织之间，消除了在枝节问题上争论不休的现象，认清了斗争大方向，增强了无产阶级感情。他们决心在毛泽东思想红旗下实行革命派的大联合，把本校的斗批改和对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判紧密地结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
