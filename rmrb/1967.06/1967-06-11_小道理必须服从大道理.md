In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the principal contradiction we need to resolve is that between the proletariat and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. To carry out a thorough criticism of the Party's top power-holder taking the capitalist road, to promote great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolutionary masses, and to gradually complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, is the current direction of the struggle. Many places and units of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, by firmly grasping this principal contradiction and the direction of the struggle, have achieved new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

After a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party have been exposed. At the same time, it has been proven that the majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. Wherever and in whatever departments mass movements have been launched vigorously, generally speaking, the class lines have become clear or relatively clear. This means that the conditions for carrying out the great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolutionary masses have been met or basically met. If we do not recognize this new situation, or if we look at problems from the standpoint of small groups or small cliques, and do not direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, but instead direct it against other mass organizations; if we do not actively participate in the thorough criticism of the handful of top power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, but instead engage in unprincipled "internal warfare," then we will have deviated from the direction of the struggle. Once the direction of the struggle is wrong, everything will be wrong.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "promote the overall situation." Chairman Mao also teaches us to "pay attention to state affairs." We must resolutely unite with the majority of the masses and cadres, and fiercely attack the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This is the "overall situation," this is "state affairs." We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, possess a great spirit of liberating all mankind and have the great mission of realizing communism. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "promote the overall situation," and "pay attention to state affairs," and not just care about the "small situation" of our own revolutionary organization or the "small affairs" of our own revolutionary organization. In a word, we must look at the direction of the struggle and not just at our own small circle.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat should understand that the reason why the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is invincible is entirely due to Mao Zedong Thought. By mastering Mao Zedong Thought and the direction of the struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, we can unite into a mighty force and make the due contribution to the Cultural Revolution. If we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and the direction of the struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, no matter how great our abilities or how much power we hold now, we will make great mistakes and may even turn into obstacles to the movement. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat must always remember this.

The following letters, articles, and reports published here all discuss the principles of grasping the principal contradiction, mastering the direction of the struggle, and uniting with the majority while attacking the handful. Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution. ... Our revolution must have the assurance of not taking the wrong path and of definitely succeeding. We must pay attention to uniting with our true friends to attack our true enemies.

Small Principles Must Submit to Big Principles

Editorial Comrades:

Our school has not yet achieved revolutionary great unity. The reason is that there are supposed "differences in views" (these differences in views do not involve major issues). Some people think that this means the basis for unity has been lost. I think this is incorrect.

"There are big principles and small principles in things. All small principles are subject to big principles. The Chinese people should think carefully about this from the standpoint of big principles, and then they can properly place their thoughts and actions in the right position." I think Chairman Mao's teaching on this point can best solve this problem.

To unite the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize the Party's top power-holder taking the capitalist road, and combine this with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit, this is grasping the principal contradiction at present, this is the direction that every revolutionary comrade acknowledges, that is, the "big principle." This big principle should be our common view and the basis for our unity. Only by recognizing this can we properly place our thoughts and actions in the position of "promoting revolutionary great unity."

Under this "big principle," we should be able to get along and unite. If we cannot achieve great unity now, this can only indicate that we are still thinking about "small principles" while away from the "big principle," and are entangled in non-principal contradictions while away from the principal contradiction. The facts in our school are exactly like this.

Most of our revolutionary youngsters are very sensitive to external matters. An incident occurred in a nearby city, and some people think we should investigate to see what really happened. Others think we should not, and we should believe in the masses there. Still, others think that investigation is bound to be one-sided and not reliable. Such differences in views can certainly not affect our great unity. Yet, in fact, there is a lot of argument on this, seriously affecting the great unity. Some people even regard different opinions on the resumption of classes in a certain class as losing the basis for unity, which is even more inappropriate.

I think if we spend too much energy seeking common views on minor issues, causing endless arguments, this is a small matter. If we forget the "big principle" and the direction, this is a big matter. Even if there are principled arguments, they can only be properly handled under the "big principle," and we must not make mistakes in the direction because of this. We must know that objective things are complex, and our understanding cannot be the same in every respect. Differences in views and opinions are only natural. To require complete agreement on "small principles" is not in accordance with objective laws. Contradictions have main and secondary aspects, and principles have big and small distinctions. We should grasp the principal contradiction and "big principle." Whoever forgets this will make mistakes.

### 小道理必须服从大道理

专栏：

    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要解决的主要矛盾是无产阶级和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的矛盾。开展对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的三结合，逐步完成本单位的斗、批、改的任务，是当前斗争的大方向。许多地方、许多单位的无产阶级革命派，由于牢牢地抓住了这个主要矛盾，掌握了这个斗争的大方向，因而取得了文化大革命的新的胜利。
    经过一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揭露出来了，同时，证明了我们的干部大多数是好的和比较好的。凡是开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动的地方和部门，一般说来，阶级阵线已经清楚了，或者比较清楚了。这就是说，实行革命的大联合和革命的三结合的条件已经具备了，或者基本上具备了。如果我们不认识这个新的形势，或者从小团体、小山头的利益出发来看问题，不把斗争的矛头对准走资本主义道路的当权派，而是对准其他群众组织；不积极投入对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，而是热衷于打无原则的“内战”；那末，这就离开了斗争的大方向。斗争的大方向一错，那就一切都错了。
    毛主席教导我们“要提倡顾全大局”。毛主席又教导我们：“要关心国家大事”。坚决团结大多数群众和干部，狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这就是“大局”，这就是“国家大事”。我们无产阶级革命派，具有解放全人类的伟大胸怀，负有实现共产主义的伟大使命，一定要按照毛主席的教导，“顾全大局”，“关心国家大事”，而不要只顾自己一个革命组织的“小局”，只关心自己一个革命组织的“小事”。一句话，要看斗争的大方向，不要只看自己的小圈子。
    无产阶级革命派应该懂得，无产阶级文化大革命之所以能战无不胜，全靠毛泽东思想。掌握了毛泽东思想，掌握了毛主席指引的斗争大方向，我们就能团结成为巨大的力量，对文化大革命作出应有的贡献。如果离开了毛泽东思想，离开了毛主席指引的斗争大方向，不管有多大的本领，不管现在掌握了多大的权力，也会犯极大的错误，甚至走向自己的反面，成为运动的阻力。无产阶级革命派要永远记住这一点。
    这里发表的几篇来信、文章和通讯，讲的都是抓住主要矛盾，掌握斗争大方向，团结大多数、打击一小撮的道理，读了对人有启发。谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。……我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。
    小道理必须服从大道理编辑同志：
    我校还没有实现革命的大联合，原因是所谓“观点不一致”（这些观点不一致不属于大是大非问题）。有人认为这就失去了联合的基础，我看是不对的。
    “事情有大道理，有小道理，一切小道理都归大道理管着。国人应从大道理上好生想一想，才好把自己的想法和做法安顿在恰当的位置。”我认为毛主席的这段教导最能解决这个问题。
    把广大革命群众联合起来，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，并结合本单位的斗批改，这是抓住了当前的主要矛盾，这是每个革命同志都承认的大方向，也就是“大道理”。这个大道理应当是我们共同的观点，是我们联合的基础。认清了这一点，才会把自己的想法和做法安顿在“促进革命的大联合”这样一个恰当的位置上。
    在这样的“大道理”下，我们应当谈得拢，能够联合起来了。现在不能实现大联合，这只能说明我们还在离开“大道理”想着“小道理”，离开主要矛盾去纠缠一些非主要矛盾，我校的事实正是如此。
    我们革命小将大多对外界事物是很敏感的。附近城市发生了一件事情，有的认为应该去调查一下，看究竟是怎么回事。有的则认为不必去，要相信那里的群众。更有的认为调查难免片面，不足为据。象这类观点的分歧，满可以不影响我们的大联合。可是，事实上各方争论很大，严重地影响了大联合。还有些人甚至把对某班复课有不同意见也看作是失去了联合的基础，这就更不应该了。
    我认为如果用过多的精力去求小是小非上的共同观点，引起无休止的争论事小，忘掉了“大道理”大方向事大。即使是带原则性的争论，也只能放在“大道理”之下妥善处理，切切不要因此搞错了大方向。须知客观事物是复杂的，我们的认识也就不可能处处一致，观点、意见总会有不同，这本不足为奇。要求对“小道理”都不谋而合，是不符合客观规律的。矛盾有主次之分，道理有大小之别，我们应该抓主要矛盾和“大道理”，谁忘了这一点，谁就要犯错误。
