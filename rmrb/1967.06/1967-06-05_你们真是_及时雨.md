	You Are Truly a "Timely Rain"

	"Here they come, here they come, the PLA is here to help us thresh the wheat."

	The head of the second production brigade of Luo Jie Production Team in Zhong Cao Commune on the outskirts of Guiyang, Tian Xingcai, heard the sound of gongs and drums from a distance and quickly called everyone to move the summer harvest tools to the threshing ground.

	These days, the hearts of the commune members are both joyful and anxious. They are joyful because Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Cultural Revolution has promoted a bumper harvest of wheat. Last winter, they responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and increased the wheat planting area by one fold compared to previous years. With sufficient base fertilizer, the wheat yield is expected to increase by 20-30%. Seeing such a bumper harvest, how could they not be joyful? They are anxious because this year the season came early, and the rainfall was concentrated, making the harvesting and planting seasons overlap, and they couldn't keep up. Although the 70 mu of wheat in the entire brigade has mostly been cut, it is still lying on the threshing ground, and if it is not threshed soon, it will be ruined.

	On May 31, nearly a thousand cadres and soldiers from the Guizhou Military Region were dispatched to the outskirts of the city to support the wheat harvest.

	The team that arrived at the second brigade of Luo Jie Production Team was from a certain communication station. On the evening of the 30th, they sent people to the brigade to discuss helping with the wheat harvest. The commune members expressed their enthusiastic welcome. They first studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the commune members, then talked about the instructions from the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and the Military Region on "launching a decisive battle for the summer harvest and planting," and then said to everyone: "We are sent by Chairman Mao to support you in the summer harvest. Abundant production and abundant harvest will strengthen the material foundation for the Cultural Revolution. A handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are now desperately sabotaging production, and the ghosts and snakes are also taking the opportunity to cause trouble. We, the PLA, will stand firmly with the poor and lower-middle peasants to ensure that not a single grain of the bumper harvest is lost. The regiment sent us to make contact, please assign tasks." After hearing the words of the PLA, everyone in the room was very happy. The head of the poor peasants' association, Xia Youfeng, said: "You are truly a 'timely rain'! Thank Chairman Mao for sending the PLA to support us at this critical moment."

	On the morning of May 31, the comrades from the communication station listened to the broadcast of the People's Daily editorial "Vigorously Promote the Summer Harvest" and became more aware of the great political significance of supporting the summer harvest. They beat gongs and drums to the threshing ground of the second brigade and immediately joined the intense battle. Soldiers and civilians fought side by side, threshing, winnowing, sieving, and transporting, busy as bees. The heavy and difficult work was taken on by the soldiers. Four threshing machines were all taken over by the soldiers. More than twenty soldiers surrounded the threshing machines, threshing the heavy wheat ears, making a clattering sound, and threshing for four hours without stopping. Sweat soaked their uniforms. Old poor peasant Li Jinhai then cut some willow branches, wove them into more than twenty hats, and gave them to the soldiers to wear to shield them from the sun. Two female soldiers operated two wind winnowers. They challenged the threshing comrades, promising to winnow as much as they threshed. After a morning of hard work, most of the wheat on the ground was threshed.

	At noon, the soldiers used their rest time to perform self-written programs for the commune members. Suddenly, the wind blew, followed by a rumble of thunder, and it seemed that rain was about to come. Looking at the remaining pile of wheat on the ground, the soldiers continued to work, not caring about their fatigue, with only one thought in their minds: they must finish threshing the wheat before the rain. The threshing ground echoed with the voices reading Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely carry out the spirit of continuous fighting, seize the bumper harvest of grain, and give a heavy blow to the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road." Class leader Zhao Guoxiang, a model soldier, shouted to everyone while threshing: "Chairman Mao teaches us: We must carry out the spirit of continuous fighting, seize the bumper harvest of grain, and give a heavy blow to the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road." The deputy head of the revolutionary rebel corps of the second brigade, Xia Jinguang, followed with a shout: "With Mao Zedong Thought guiding us and the PLA helping us, we will seize the grain from the dragon's mouth."

	The entire threshing ground became even more lively. By around 3:00 PM, all the wheat was threshed, and the rain had not come yet. Everyone finally let out a sigh of relief. While cleaning the threshing ground, old poor peasant Li Haiquan excitedly said: "If it weren't for the PLA, we would not be able to harvest and thresh in three or four days." At the soldier-civilian joint celebration, he sang "The East Is Red" loudly, expressing his feelings for the comrades of the PLA.

### 你们真是“及时雨”

    你们真是“及时雨”
    “来了，来了，解放军帮我们打麦子来了。”
    贵阳市郊中曹公社洛解大队第二生产队队长田兴才，听到了远处的锣鼓声，连忙招呼大家把夏收农具赶快搬到晒场来。
    这些日子，社员心里真是又高兴又发急。高兴的是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，促进了小麦大丰收。去年冬天，他们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，小麦播种面积比往年扩大了一倍，底肥足，小麦少说也要增产二、三成。看到这样的大丰收，怎么能不高兴？着急的是今年季节早，雨水又集中，收种挤在一起，忙不过来。全队七十亩小麦虽说大都割下了，但是还摆在晒场上，再不打就会糟蹋了。
    五月三十一日，贵州省军区派出了近千名干部、战士，来到市郊支援麦收。
    到洛解大队二队的，是某部通讯站的同志们。三十日晚上，他们派人到队上联系帮助收麦的事。社员们表示热烈欢迎。他们先同社员们一起学习《为人民服务》，然后又给大家谈了贵州省革命委员会、省军区“关于打好夏季抢收抢种歼灭战的指示”，随后对大家说：“我们是毛主席派来支援你们搞好夏收的。丰产又丰收，就为无产阶级文化大革命增强了物质基础。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，现在拚命破坏生产，牛鬼蛇神也趁机捣乱，我们解放军坚决和贫下中农站在一起，要把丰收的果实一粒不丢地拿到手。连队派我们来联系，请分配任务吧。”听完解放军的话，满屋子的人都十分高兴。贫协主任夏有丰说：“你们真是‘及时雨’呀！感谢毛主席他老人家在节骨眼上派解放军支援我们。”
    三十一日清早，通讯站的同志们听到广播《人民日报》社论：《大力抓紧夏收》，更清楚地认识到支援夏收的重大政治意义，他们敲锣打鼓来到二队晒场上，立即投入紧张的战斗。军民战斗在一起，打的、簸的、筛的、运送的，忙个不停，晒场上顿时沸腾了起来。重活、难活，战士们抢着干。四张打斗全由战士们包了下来。二十几个战士围着打斗，摔打着沉甸甸的麦穗，乒乒乓乓，一气打了四小时，汗水把军装都湿透了。老贫农李金海这时砍了些柳枝，编成二十几顶帽子给战士们戴在头上，遮遮太阳。两个女战士掌管两架风簸，她们向打麦的同志提出了“挑战”，打多少，她们保证风净多少。一个上午苦战，场上的麦子大部分打完了。
    中午，战士们利用休息时间向社员们表演自编的节目。这时突然吹起风，接着响起一阵雷声，眼看大雨要来了。看看场上剩下的一堆麦子，战士们又接着干起来，谁也顾不了疲劳，心里只有一个信念：一定要在雨前把麦子打完。晒场上响起了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”一片读语录的声音。五好战士、班长赵国香一边打麦一边向大家高声喊道：“毛主席教导我们：要发扬连续作战的精神，把丰收的粮食全部拿到手，狠狠打击党内走资本主义道路的当权派。”二队的革命造反纵队副队长夏金群接着高喊：“有毛泽东思想指导我们，有解放军帮助我们，我们要把粮食从龙嘴里夺回来。”
    整个麦场更加沸腾了。到下午三点多钟，麦子全部打完了，雨还没有下来，大家才松了一口气。在清扫麦场的时候，老贫农李海全激动地说：“要不是解放军来，我们三四天也收打不完。”在军民联欢会上，他高声歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》，表达了对解放军同志的心意。
