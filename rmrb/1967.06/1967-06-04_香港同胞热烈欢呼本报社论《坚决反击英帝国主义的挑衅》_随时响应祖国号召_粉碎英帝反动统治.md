Hong Kong compatriots warmly welcome the People's Daily editorial "Resolutely Countering the Provocations of British Imperialism"
Ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time to smash British imperialist reactionary rule

	New China News Agency, Hong Kong, June 3rd - Today, the broad masses of workers, students, and compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong warmly welcomed the editorial "Resolutely Countering the Provocations of British Imperialism" published in the People's Daily on the 3rd. People excitedly said that this editorial embodies the greatest concern and support from Chairman Mao, the reddest sun in our hearts, for the struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against British imperialist oppression. This is the strongest voice from the motherland. After reading the editorial, our confidence is stronger, and our fighting spirit is more vigorous. We are ready to charge forward at the motherland's command, determined to smash the reactionary rule of British imperialism to pieces!

	The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" jointly published an extra edition this morning. Workers and students quickly distributed the extra edition to the masses. Many factories, schools, banks, and store windows displayed the extra edition. Many institutions, disregarding the so-called "emergency regulations" issued by the Hong Kong British authorities, used loudspeakers to broadcast the full text of the editorial to the streets. Upon hearing this good news, compatriots were all elated and inspired. They said that this editorial greatly boosts the morale of patriotic compatriots and greatly dampens the arrogance of British imperialism. From now on, our direction of struggle is clearer. We will study it word by word and sentence by sentence, and use it well to march forward bravely towards the great goal of victory.

	Brave workers who participated in the anti-violence struggle gathered immediately after studying the People's Daily editorial. The workers, full of confidence, declared that they would follow the editorial's instructions, persist in the struggle, resist the enemy, pursue the fleeing, and fight British imperialism to the ground! The workers said that the editorial mentioned that this struggle is led by the Hong Kong working class, which is the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We will be well-prepared, and as soon as the motherland issues the call, we will rush to the front lines and drown the British imperialists in the vast ocean of Hong Kong compatriots.

	At the meeting, the workers repeatedly shouted excitedly: "Down with British imperialism!" "The blood debt of the Hong Kong British authorities must be settled!" "The Hong Kong British will be defeated! We will be victorious!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

	Workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon, such as public buses, trams, docks, seafarers, cement, and the Chinese workers of the Hong Kong British "Marine Department," read the People's Daily editorial. Some did not even eat lunch and immediately discussed it; some immediately wrote statements of resolve, firmly supporting the editorial's call, expressing their determination to further unite and organize, forming a vast revolutionary army. They will expose and publicize the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong over more than a hundred years and march bravely against the evil British imperialism.

	A public bus worker said that the Hong Kong British authorities, despite repeated warnings from our country's people, not only showed no sign of repentance but also issued a series of so-called "emergency regulations," plotting to suppress our compatriots on a larger scale. We will not be intimidated by this paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. We will not only put up more big-character posters but also mobilize all compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to launch a powerful counterattack against British imperialism.

	A seafarer worker said, "Our cargo ships have been to Haiphong in Vietnam. American imperialist bandit planes dropped bombs on us, but we were not afraid. A few police batons, a few 'regulations,' and a few broken-down warships from British imperialism, do they really scare us? These few straws of life are absolutely unable to save it from its doomed fate."

	A cement worker said, "Now, compatriots from all industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon, as well as the New Territories, are quickly mobilizing. We have the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, supporting us. We have the hundreds of millions of Red Guards who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We have seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful backing. We will be victorious! The Hong Kong British will be defeated!"

	When the good news reached the schools, the students were extremely excited and moved. Some immediately studied and wrote statements of resolve, while others quickly held meetings. The students said that they would closely unite with the workers, resolutely defend the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, uphold the dignity of the Chinese nation, and be determined to fight to the end with British imperialism, vowing to achieve the final victory.

    香港同胞热烈欢呼本报社论《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》
    随时响应祖国号召  粉碎英帝反动统治
    新华社香港三日电　香港广大工人、学生和各阶层爱国同胞，今天热烈欢呼《人民日报》三日《坚决反击英帝国主义的挑衅》社论的发表。人们兴奋地说，这篇社论体现了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席对香港同胞反抗英帝国主义迫害斗争的最大关怀和最大支持，这是来自祖国的最强音。我们读了社论后，信心更坚强，斗志更旺盛，只待祖国一声令下，我们誓叫英帝国主义的反动统治粉身碎骨！
    香港《文汇报》、《大公报》今天上午联合出版了号外。工人、学生纷纷行动起来，以最快的速度把号外送到广大同胞手里；许多工厂、学校内和银行、商店的橱窗都把号外张贴出来，许多机构不理港英当局颁布的所谓“紧急法令”那一套，用扩音器向街外广播社论的全文。同胞们听到这个喜讯后，无不欢欣鼓舞，他们表示，这篇社论大长爱国同胞的斗志，大灭英帝国主义的威风。今后，我们的斗争方向更加明确。我们一定逐字逐句地去学习，好好地运用，向着伟大的胜利目标奋勇前进。
    英勇参加抗暴斗争的胶业工人在学习了《人民日报》社论后，立即举行集会。工人们信心百倍地表示，一定要按照社论指示的那样去做，坚持斗争，抗顽敌，追穷寇，把英帝国主义斗垮，斗臭！工人们说，社论中提到这场斗争以香港工人阶级为主力军，这是毛主席他老人家交给我们工人阶级光荣的重担，我们一定不辜负毛主席的期望，我们要做好一切准备，只要祖国发出号召，我们立即奔赴前线，把英帝国主义者淹没在香港同胞的汪洋大海之中。
    集会上，工人们一遍又一遍激动地高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“港英当局的血债一定要清算！”“港英必败！我们必胜！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    站在当前反帝抗暴斗争最前列的港九公共汽车、电车、船坞、海员、水泥等行业工人和港英“海事处”中国工人读到《人民日报》社论后，有的连中午饭也不吃，立即进行讨论；有的立即写了决心书，坚决拥护社论的号召，表示要进一步团结起来，组织起来，结成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，揭发和宣传英帝国主义一百多年来在香港犯下的滔天罪行，向万恶的英帝国主义勇猛进军。
    一名公共汽车工人说，港英当局不顾我国人民的一再警告，不但毫无悔罪之意，反而颁布一连串的所谓“紧急法令”，阴谋对我同胞进行更大规模的镇压，我们绝不会被这只外强中干的纸老虎所吓倒，我们不但要贴更多的大字报，我们还要把全港九同胞发动起来，向英帝国主义发动强大的反击。
    一名海员工人说，我们的货船到过越南海防，美帝国主义的强盗飞机在我们头上丢炸弹，我们也毫不畏惧，英帝国主义的几根警棍、几道“法令”和几艘破烂军舰，难道就吓倒了我们？这几根救命稻草是绝对挽救不了它将要灭亡的命运的。
    一名水泥工友说，现在港九各行各业以及郊区新界的同胞都迅速动员起来了，我们有心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席撑腰，有在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大胜利的祖国千百万红卫兵的支持，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民作强大的后盾，我们必胜！港英必败！
    当喜讯传到学校的时候，同学们无限兴奋，无限激动，有的立即进行学习和写决心书，有的马上举行大会。同学们说，我们一定同工人们紧密地结合起来，为保卫伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，维护中华民族的尊严，下定决心，不怕牺牲，同英帝国主义血战到底，誓夺最后胜利。
