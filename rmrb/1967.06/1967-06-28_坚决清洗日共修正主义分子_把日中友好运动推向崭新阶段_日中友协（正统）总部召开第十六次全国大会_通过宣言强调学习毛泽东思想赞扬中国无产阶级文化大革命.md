The Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters held its sixteenth national congress on June 24-25 in Tokyo. This was the first congress held by genuine Japan-China friendship advocates after they expelled the Japanese Communist Party revisionists and established the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters. It was also a congress where the Japanese revolutionary people, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, were inspired by the great victories of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, overcame the sabotage of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionists, and Japanese Communist Party revisionists, and reviewed the forces that insist on genuine Japan-China friendship.

The delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association could not attend the congress due to the unreasonable obstruction by the Japanese Sato government.

The congress hall was adorned with a large portrait of Chairman Mao's quotation: "Apart from the monopolistic capital and militarist clique that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." The hall was also decorated with many large banners reading "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" and "Long live the victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution!"

The loudspeakers continuously broadcast songs such as "The Boat Sails on with the Helmsman at the Tiller."

After the secretary of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, Miyoshi Kazuyoshi, announced the opening of the congress, the vice-chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), Kurosawa Toshio, delivered a speech.

Kurosawa highly praised the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution in his speech. He said: "Whether one can correctly understand the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a key issue in determining whether to follow the path of Japan-China friendship or the path of anti-China. If one cannot correctly understand the Chinese cultural revolution, the Japan-China friendship movement cannot proceed. We must strive to correctly understand the Chinese cultural revolution and raise the Japan-China friendship movement to a new stage."

After Kurosawa's speech, Wu Shudong, the representative of the Liaison Office of the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association in Tokyo, read the congratulatory message from the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association to the congress.

The chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), Miyazaki Seiken, reviewed the activities since the fifteenth congress.

Miyazaki said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has greatly inspired the Japanese people, and the thought of Mao Zedong has become increasingly widespread among the Japanese people of all strata.

Miyazaki said that the Japan-China friendship movement has entered a new stage since the establishment of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters. The Japan-China friendship associations across the country are filled with the confidence to dare to struggle and dare to win, which is unprecedented.

Miyazaki said that now there are 42 prefectures and cities that have established organizations of the (orthodox) headquarters, and the membership has exceeded 10,000.

On the morning of June 25, the congress first read the congratulatory telegram from the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and seven other Chinese people's organizations to the congress. The telegram was warmly welcomed.

The congress unanimously adopted the congress declaration and a letter of respect to the Chinese people in the afternoon of June 25, and elected new leaders before closing successfully.

The declaration said: This congress is the first one held under the banner of justice since the struggle against those who opposed Japan-China friendship from within and attempted to turn the association into an anti-China tool, and expelled the Japanese Communist Party revisionists on October 25 last year.

The declaration condemned the Japanese Communist Party revisionists for "publicly and maliciously slandering the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and inciting anti-China sentiment among Japanese workers and progressive people. They are in cahoots with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and Soviet modern revisionists, using the banner of 'revolutionary party' to confuse people and playing the most vile role of the spearhead in creating public opinion for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries."

The declaration said: "We must unite closely, correctly understand the true significance of the proletarian cultural revolution initiated by Chairman Mao Zedong, and carry out a genuine and powerful Japan-China friendship movement among the people of all strata."

The declaration expressed the determination to learn from Mao Zedong Thought, carry out various activities, develop Japan-China friendship exchanges in various fields, and strive for brilliant victories in the struggle for Japan-China friendship and the restoration of diplomatic relations. The declaration concluded: "No force can stop the wheels of Japan-China friendship. Victory will surely be ours."

In the letter of respect to the Chinese people, the congress expressed warm greetings of solidarity to the Chinese people.

The letter of respect concluded with the slogans: Long live the fighting friendship between the 800 million people of China and Japan! Long live the great thought of Mao Zedong and the victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution! Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the peoples of China and Japan! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

The congress also adopted resolutions condemning the Sato government's obstruction of the entry of the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation, and resolutions to firmly support the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people and their common struggle, among other documents.

Before closing, the congress unanimously elected Kurosawa Toshio as the chairman, Ito Takeo, Yoshida Hosei, and Kawase Katsunori as vice-chairmen, and selected Nakajima Takeshige, Nishikawa Keifumi, and 16 others as advisors, Miyazaki Seiken, Ohmori Shinichiro, and 62 others as standing directors, and directors and auditors.

The congress also adopted a plan on strengthening the basic principles of the Japan-China friendship movement on June 25.

    坚决清洗日共修正主义分子　把日中友好运动推向崭新阶段
    日中友协（正统）总部召开第十六次全国大会
    通过宣言强调学习毛泽东思想赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日中友好协会（正统）总部二十四日——二十五日在东京召开第十六次全国大会。这是真正主张日中友好的日本朋友排除了日共修正主义分子成立日中友好协会（正统）总部以后举行的第一次大会，也是日本革命人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下，在中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个的伟大的胜利的鼓舞下，战胜了美日反动派、苏联现代修正主义和日共修正主义分子的种种破坏，检阅坚持真正的日中友好运动力量的一次大会。
    中国日本友好协会代表团，因为日本佐藤政府的无理阻挠，没能参加这次大会。
    大会会场悬挂着毛主席的巨幅语录：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”会场上还张贴了许多“日中两国人民战斗友谊万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”等大字标语。
    会场的扩音器不断地播送着《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。
    在日中友好协会（正统）总部事务局长三好一宣布开会以后，由日中友好协会（正统）副会长黑田寿男致词。
    黑田在讲话中热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说：“能不能正确地理解中国无产阶级文化大革命，是走日中友好道路还是走反华道路的一个关键问题。如果不能正确地认识中国文化大革命，日中友好运动就不能进行。我们应当努力正确地认识中国文化大革命，把日中友好运动提高到一个崭新的阶段。”
    黑田讲话之后，廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表吴曙东宣读了中国日本友好协会代表团向大会的贺词。
    日中友好协会（正统）理事长宫崎世民回顾了第十五次大会以来的活动。
    宫崎说，中国无产阶级文化大革命给了日本人民极大的鼓舞，毛泽东思想已经愈来愈广泛地深入日本各阶层人民。
    宫崎说，日中友好运动自日中友好协会（正统）总部成立以后，已经完全进入一个新的阶段，全国的日中友协组织都充满了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的信心，这是前所未有的。
    宫崎说，现在全国已有四十二个都道府县建立了（正统）总部的组织，会员已超过一万多人。
    在二十五日上午的会议上首先宣读了中国人民对外文化友好协会等中国八个人民团体打给大会的贺电。贺电受到了热烈的欢迎。
    大会在二十五日下午，在热烈的掌声中一致通过大会宣言和给中国人民的致敬信，并选出新的领导成员后胜利闭幕。
    宣言说：这次大会是高举正义的旗帜在去年十月二十五日同那些从内部反对日中友好，企图把协会变成反华工具的日共修正主义分子进行斗争，并把他们清洗出去以来举行的第一次大会。
    宣言谴责日本共产党修正主义分子“公开恶毒地诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命及中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，在日本工人阶级和进步人士中间疯狂地煽动反华情绪。他们同美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义一个鼻孔出气，打着‘革命政党’的招牌，混淆视听，扮演着为美日反动派制造舆论的最恶劣的尖兵的角色”。
    宣言说：“我们必须紧密地团结起来，正确地理解毛泽东主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命的真正意义，在国民的各个阶层中开展真正的强大的日中友好运动。”
    宣言表示要学习毛泽东思想，并进行各种工作，发展各个领域的日中友好交流活动，为争取日中友好和恢复邦交的斗争取得光辉胜利而奋斗。宣言最后说：“任何力量也阻挡不了日中友好的车轮前进。胜利一定是属于我们的。”
    大会在给中国人民的致敬信中表示向中国人民致以热烈的团结的问候。
    致敬信最后高呼：日中两国八亿人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想、中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    日中两国人民心中的红太阳毛主席万岁！
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    大会还通过了谴责佐藤政府阻挠中日友好协会代表团入境的决议，以及“坚决支援越南人民的反美爱国斗争和越南人民共同战斗的决议”等文件。
    大会在闭幕以前一致选出黑田寿男为会长，伊藤武雄、吉田法晴、川濑一贯为副会长，选出中岛健藏、西川景文等十八人为顾问，宫崎世民、大森真一郎等六十四人为常任理事以及理事和会计监察等。
    在二十五日的会议上还通过了关于加强日中友好运动基本方针的方案。
