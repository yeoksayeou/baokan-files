Shanghai Chemical Industry System Holds Study Class on Chairman Mao's Works

Leaders of revolutionary mass organizations sit together to study

Use the great Mao Zedong Thought to resolve differences

Break down non-proletarian thoughts, better grasp the direction of struggle, unite ideologically, and jointly confront the enemy

Editor's Note: During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is not surprising that some revolutionary mass organizations have differing opinions on this or that issue. The key is how to address and resolve these differences.

The experience of the Shanghai Chemical Industry System tells us that first and foremost, one must sit down and seriously study the works of Chairman Mao, the notices of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the series of extremely important directives recently issued by Chairman Mao. Especially the leaders of the mass organizations must take the lead in studying and applying these works, distinguishing between enemies and friends, grasping the direction of the struggle, and resolutely acting in accordance with the directives of Chairman Mao and the policies of the Party Central Committee.

Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must correctly treat themselves, engage in more self-criticism, dare to rebel against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in their minds, and eliminate anarchism, factionalism, opportunism, and individualism.

When dealing with revolutionary mass organizations that hold different opinions, one must look at the overall direction and main trends of the other side. If there are differing opinions, they should be resolved through consultation. If one only sees the shortcomings and errors of the other side, seizes on the minor issues, exaggerates them, and fails to distinguish between enemies and friends, then one will commit errors in direction and line.

All revolutionary mass organizations must have a broad perspective and consider the overall situation, uniting under the premise of a consistent overall direction!

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 7th - The Chemical Industry Liaison Station of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Chemical Industry Workers' Congress recently jointly held a study class on the works of Chairman Mao, inviting leaders of originally opposing revolutionary mass organizations from various factories to study Chairman Mao's works together. Through the study, everyone used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, raise their awareness, summarize their experiences in struggle, better grasp the direction of the struggle, and discuss and resolve issues of disagreement between the two sides, thereby promoting revolutionary unity and advancing revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations.

Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, most factories in the Shanghai Chemical Industry System have achieved revolutionary unity, with many having realized revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. However, there are still a few factories with two or more revolutionary mass organizations that have differing views on certain issues, with serious opposing sentiments, and some are engaged in endless "internal wars." Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations spend their energy on handling affairs and waging "internal wars," with little time for studying Chairman Mao's works, and some even do not have time to read the newspapers, failing to keep up with Chairman Mao's latest directives. These issues have affected revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. To help the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in these factories better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform their thinking, improve their work, and keep up with the situation, the Chemical Industry Liaison Station and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Chemical Industry Workers' Congress held this study class on Chairman Mao's works.

The study class, based on the actual thoughts of the participants, organized everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and important editorials and articles from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily," and conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work outside the class, enabling the participants to calmly sit down and study and discuss issues. The study class also organized experience-sharing sessions, inviting revolutionary cadres from some units to introduce their experiences in stopping "internal wars," uniting ideologically, uniting in struggle, and achieving revolutionary unity.

At the end of the study, everyone felt they had gained a lot, believing that this study greatly promoted unity within the factories.

During the study period, many comrades used the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the "target" of various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, significantly raising their ideological awareness and policy level. Everyone realized that revolutionary unity is the trend of the times. Some leaders of opposing mass organizations, who previously could not sit down together to discuss issues due to "internal wars" and mutual resentment, are now able to sit down together and discuss issues openly. They also brought this spirit back to their factories, enabling the revolutionary masses of both sides to discuss issues together. Some factories' two factions reached agreements on mutual rapprochement during the study, with both sides arranging study times together, conducting joint criticism, and jointly rectifying their work styles. Major issues were discussed and resolved through mutual consultation, and the spirit of unity from the study class was brought back to the factories.

Through the study, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations saw the situation clearly, distinguishing between enemies, friends, and ourselves, between main and secondary contradictions, and between main trends and minor issues. Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution." Some organizations, during their "internal wars," exaggerated the shortcomings and errors of the other side, with both sides claiming that the other's "overall direction is wrong." Through the study, many comrades raised their awareness. They said: "The shortcomings and errors committed by some revolutionary mass organizations in their struggles are minor issues, not the main trend. When looking at the other organization, one should look at its main trend and not treat minor issues as the main trend." The leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations in Dongfang Chemical Factory, through the study, unanimously agreed that the current task is to launch a struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory, which is the direction of the struggle. In the great criticism and great struggle, all revolutionary mass organizations must unite under the premise of a consistent overall direction, which is the need of the revolution. For the shortcomings and errors of some organizations, one should not dwell on them or treat minor issues as the main trend, affecting the great unity. One combat team in this factory decided, in addition to insisting on studying Chairman Mao's works and relevant editorials, to adhere to three principles: not saying anything against the great unity, not doing anything against the great unity, and not acting emotionally, insisting on struggle through words and opposing struggle through violence. The two mass organizations in this factory also decided to each send representatives to discuss the issue of great unity together.

Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, during the study, seriously engaged in criticism, especially self-criticism. They regarded serious self-criticism as an important method to resolve the relationships between various revolutionary mass organizations. The leaders of several revolutionary mass organizations in Dazhong Pharmaceutical Factory, during the study, calmly exchanged opinions, engaged in more self-criticism, and expressed their determination to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle in the revolutionary great criticism, promoting revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. After returning to the factory, they decided to jointly convene meetings of all members of several teams to further conduct self-examinations, raising the awareness of the broad masses of cadres about the great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations.

    上海化工系统举办毛主席著作学习班
    让革命群众组织负责人坐在一起学习
    用伟大的毛泽东思想来解决分歧问题
    大破非无产阶级思想，更好地掌握斗争大方向，从思想上联合起来，共同对敌
    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命中，一些革命群众组织在这样或那样的问题上产生了意见分歧，是不奇怪的。问题在于怎样对待和解决。
    上海化工系统的经验告诉我们，首先要坐下来，认真学习毛主席著作，学习中共中央《通知》以及最近发表的毛主席一系列极其重要的指示。特别是各群众组织的负责人，要带头学，带头用，分清敌我友，掌握斗争大方向，坚决按照毛主席的指示和党中央的政策办事。
    无产阶级革命派要正确对待自己，多作自我批评，敢于造自己头脑中资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的反，铲除无政府主义、小团体主义、风头主义和个人主义。
    对待持有不同意见的革命群众组织，要看对方的大方向，看主流。有了意见，通过协商解决。如果只看到对方的缺点错误，抓住对方的支流，无限上纲，敌我不分，那就会犯方向、路线的错误。
    一切革命群众组织，都要识大体，顾大局，在大方向一致的前提下联合起来！
    新华社上海七日电　上海工人革命造反总司令部化工系统联络总站和上海化工“工代会”筹备处，最近联合举办了一个毛主席著作学习班，让一些工厂里原来对立的革命群众组织的负责人，在一起共同学习毛主席著作。在学习中，大家用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来克服自己头脑里的各种非无产阶级思想，提高觉悟，总结斗争经验，更好地掌握斗争的大方向，把双方有分歧的问题摊到桌面上来商量解决，从而推动了革命的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，上海化工系统的大部分厂已经实现了革命的大联合，其中有不少已经实现了革命的“三结合”。但是，也还有少部分工厂有两个或两个以上的革命群众组织，这些革命群众组织对某些问题的看法有分歧，对立的情绪比较严重，有的还在无休止地打“内战”。有些革命群众组织的负责人，把精力用在处理事务和打“内战”上，学习毛主席著作的时间很少，甚至连报纸也没有时间看，对毛主席的最新指示跟得不紧。这些，都影响了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。为了帮助这些厂的革命群众组织的负责人更好地活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，改进工作，跟上形势，化工联络总站和化工“工代会”筹备处举办了这个毛主席著作学习班。
    学习班针对学员的活思想，组织大家活学活用毛主席著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的重要社论和文章，并且在会外进行深入细致的思想政治工作，使参加学习的同志平心静气地坐下来学习和讨论问题。学习班还组织了经验交流，请一些单位的无产阶级革命派介绍有关他们单位对立的革命群众组织停止“内战”，从思想上联合起来，团结起来，一致对敌，实现革命大联合的经验。学习结束时，大家觉得收获很大，认为这次学习大大有利于推动厂里的大联合。
    在学习期间，许多同志用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射自己头脑里各种非无产阶级思想之“的”，思想觉悟和政策水平大大提高。大家认识到，革命的大联合是大势所趋，一些双方对立的群众组织的负责人，过去因为打“内战”，相互憋气，坐不到一起来谈问题；现在能够一起坐下来把问题摊到桌面上来讨论了。他们还把这个精神带回厂里，使双方组织的革命群众也能共同商量问题。有的厂的两派在学习中就达成互相靠拢的协议，双方统一安排学习时间，统一搞联合批判；双方开门整风；有关重大问题经过双方讨论解决；把学习班的团结精神带回厂去。
    通过学习，一些革命群众组织的负责人看清了形势，分清了敌友我、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、主流和支流。毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条中说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”有些组织，在打“内战”时，把对方的一些缺点和错误无限“上纲”，双方都说对方的“大方向错了”。通过学习，不少同志提高了认识。他们说：“一些革命群众组织在斗争中所犯的缺点和错误，是支流，不是主流。我们看对方组织，要看对方的主流，不能把支流当主流。”东方化工厂的两个革命群众组织的负责人，通过学习，一致认为：当前开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，这是斗争的大方向。在大批判、大斗争中，各个革命群众组织必须在大方向一致的前提下联合起来，这是革命的需要。对于某些组织的缺点和错误，不要揪住不放，不要把支流当成主流，影响了大联合。这个厂的一个战斗队除决定要坚持学习毛主席著作和有关社论以外，还要做到三不，即不讲不利于大联合的话；不做不利于大联合的事；不感情用事，坚持文斗，反对武斗。这个厂的两个群众组织还决定各自派出代表，一起商量大联合的问题。
    不少革命群众组织的负责人，在学习过程中认真地开展批评特别是自我批评。他们把认真的自我批评当成是解决各个革命群众组织之间关系问题的一个重要方法。大众药厂的几个革命群众组织负责人，在学习时心平气和地交换意见，多作自我批评，并表示要在革命的大批判中紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。他们回厂以后，决定联合召开几个队的全体队员会议，进一步作检查，以提高广大队员对大联合和革命的“三结合”的认识。
