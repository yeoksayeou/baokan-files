Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao has kindly instructed us, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, to strive to unite with all those who can be united. He has said, as Marx did, that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. We must resolutely act according to this great instruction from Chairman Mao.

Currently, some comrades have erroneous thoughts and practices that need to be consciously corrected.

Within the organizations of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, some comrades are not good at listening to different opinions, not good at presenting facts and reasoning, but instead are keen on using the method of "labeling" to suppress different opinions. The result is that unprincipled arguments develop, causing emotional opposition and hindering political and ideological unity.

Between the organizations of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, there is often mutual opposition due to differing views on some issues, exacerbated by anarchism, factionalism, and the desire for personal gain. Originally, if it was one organization, they would split off to form another faction; if it was two organizations, they would go their separate ways. Sometimes, they even ignore the class enemy and are eager to engage in "internal warfare," causing pain to friends and joy to enemies.

Between the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the masses who have been deceived into joining conservative organizations, we should absolutely follow the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," adhering to the spirit of both clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades, correctly resolving differences in understanding. However, some comrades are not good at doing painstaking and detailed political and ideological work, do not give deceived comrades the process of raising their consciousness, but instead demand that they agree completely with the revolutionary cadres' understanding overnight. If there are still some issues they cannot understand, they are labeled as "diehard reactionaries" or "hardened elements"; if there are mistakes in their actions, they are accused of being "conservative turncoats," and so on. In a word, it is not patient persuasion, but simple and rough, even treating deceived masses as enemies.

The occurrence of the above phenomena is not accidental; they have deep class and social roots.

Firstly, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in their dying moments, always try to confuse class lines, incite internal strife within revolutionary organizations and between them, and even provoke armed clashes, in order to shift the direction of the struggle, attack the revolutionary cadres, and protect themselves. The proletarian revolutionary cadres must be highly vigilant against the enemy's plots and must never forget class struggle, never engage in "internal warfare" and let the enemy slip away.

Secondly, we proletarian revolutionary cadres ourselves have not sufficiently applied Mao Zedong Thought in practice. For a considerable period, we have not seriously sat down to study and understand Mao Zedong Thought, using Chairman Mao's instructions to seriously examine all our actions. Some people, to varying degrees, have been poisoned by "Cultivation of the Self" and have not fundamentally changed their bourgeois worldview. In times of revolutionary success, especially after coming to power, various erroneous tendencies are exposed. They do not have a broad vision for the country and the world, do not prioritize the struggle against the enemy, do not grasp the direction of the struggle, but instead engage in anarchism, personal gain, and factionalism; they do not trust the masses, rely on the masses, or have deep class feelings for comrades who make mistakes and deceived masses, but instead are self-righteous, rough, and discriminatory towards comrades who have made mistakes, even issuing orders and suppressing different opinions.

Some comrades are not good at looking at problems comprehensively and developmentally, but instead look at them one-sidedly and statically. They think that because they have rebelled against the bourgeois reactionary line in the past, they have always been correct and do not strictly demand of themselves; some individuals have gone to the other extreme from opposing bourgeois slavishness, ignoring the discipline and authority of the proletariat. They think that if others make mistakes, they will always lag behind and not be transformed. If their organization achieves success, they do not see the shortcomings and are not humble and cautious, having no interest in self-revolution. If other organizations make some mistakes, they do not see their achievements, always wanting to overthrow them and destroy their organizations. Towards conservative organizations, they do not distinguish between the few bad individuals behind them and the broad masses who have been deceived, do not strive to unite with all those who can be united, but instead push them to the enemy's side. This way of thinking and acting is very harmful.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We must put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything, especially to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's theories on the proletarian revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and study the great historical documents personally drafted by Chairman Mao, such as the "Notification" from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, which proposes the theories, lines, policies, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must firmly grasp the main contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

Our beloved Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of revolution. Revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, this revolution will not be successful." The proletarian revolutionary cadres must resolutely respond to the call of Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, and in the process of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in the great struggle of criticism and struggle, constantly link our living thoughts, dare to revolutionize the bourgeois ideas in our minds, dare to confront our shortcomings and errors with bayonets, and in self-revolution, also be daring and bold revolutionaries. As long as we can study the "Three Articles" as our motto, truly free ourselves from the spiritual shackles of "self," and establish the viewpoint of completely and thoroughly serving the people, we will definitely be able to take the liberation of the masses and all of humanity as our sole struggle goal, deeply understand and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's requirements for us from the height of the proletarian worldview.

### 必须正确地对待自己对待群众

    必须正确地对待自己对待群众
    北京外贸学院东方红公社  吴永亮  宋峥  李水林  何乃华
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲切地教导我们无产阶级革命派，要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。我们一定要坚决按照毛主席这一伟大教导办事。
    现在有些同志存在着一些错误思想和做法，应该自觉改正。
    在无产阶级革命派组织内部，有些同志不善于倾听不同意见，不善于摆事实讲道理，却热中于用“扣帽子”的办法来压制不同意见。结果是：无原则的争论发展起来，造成情绪对立，妨碍了政治上思想上坚强的统一。
    在无产阶级革命派组织之间，也常常因为对一些问题的认识不一致，再加上无政府主义、小团体主义、风头主义作怪，造成相互对立。原来是一个组织的，就要拉出队伍，另立山头；原来是两个组织的，更要分道扬镖。有时竟置阶级敌人于不顾，而热心于打“内战”，使亲者痛，仇者快。
    在无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众之间，完全应该按照团结——批评——团结的公式，本着既要弄清思想又要团结同志的精神，正确地解决认识上的分歧。但是，有些同志，不善于做艰苦细致的政治思想工作，不给予受蒙蔽的同志提高认识的过程，却要求他们在一天早上就和革命派的认识完全一致。如果还有些问题想不通，就被看做是“死顽固”、“铁了心”；如果行动上再有错误，就会被指责为“老保翻天”等等。一句话，不是耐心说服，而是简单粗暴，甚至用对待敌人的态度来对待受蒙蔽的群众。
    上述现象的发生，绝不是偶然的，有它深刻的阶级根源和社会根源的。
    首先，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在即将灭亡的垂死关头，总是竭力混淆阶级阵线，挑动革命组织内部和革命组织之间打“内战”，甚至挑起武斗，借以转移斗争的大方向，打击革命派，保护自己过关。无产阶级革命派，必须高度警惕阶级敌人的阴谋，千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能只顾打“内战”而放跑了敌人。
    其次，我们无产阶级革命派本身对毛泽东思想活学活用得很不够，相当长一段时间没有认真坐下来好好学习，领会毛泽东思想，用毛主席的教导认真对照检查自己的一切行动。有些人在不同程度上，又中过《修养》的毒，资产阶级的世界观还没有得到根本的改造。在革命形势顺利的时候，特别是当权以后，各种错误思想倾向就暴露出来。他们不是胸怀祖国，放眼世界，处处以对敌斗争为重，掌握斗争的大方向，而是搞无政府主义、风头主义、小团体主义；不是相信群众，依靠群众，对同志满腔热忱，对犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众怀着深厚的阶级感情去耐心帮助，而是自以为是，简单粗暴，歧视犯过错误的同志，甚至发号施令，压制不同意见。
    有些同志不善于全面地、发展地看问题，而是片面地、静止地看问题。自己过去造了资产阶级反动路线的反，就以为自己一贯正确，不再严格要求自己；个别同志还从反对资产阶级奴隶主义走向另一个极端，无视无产阶级的纪律和权威。别人犯了错误，就以为人家永远落后，不再转化。自己的组织有了成绩，就看不到缺点，不再谦虚谨慎，对于自我革命没有兴趣。别的组织犯有一些错误，就看不到他们的成绩，总想革人家的命，把人家的组织整垮。对于保守组织，也不把背后操纵的个别坏人和广大受蒙蔽的群众区别开来，不去争取团结一切可以团结的人，却把他们推到敌人方面去了。这种想法和作法是非常有害的。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。我们要做到团结一切可以团结的人们。实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。就必须把活学活用毛主席著作，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，特别是要活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下的无产阶级革命的学说，学习毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大的历史文件中共中央《通知》中所提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，紧紧抓住无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派这一主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
    我们敬爱的林彪副统帅说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”无产阶级革命派，要坚决响应林彪副统帅的号召，在活学活用毛主席著作的过程中，在大批判大斗争的战斗中，时刻联系自己的活思想，敢于革自己头脑中资产阶级思想的命，敢于对自己的缺点错误刺刀见红，在自我革命方面也要作敢冲敢打的革命闯将。只要我们能够把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，真正从“私”字的精神枷锁下解放出来，树立起完全彻底为人民服务的观点，我们就一定能够把群众的解放、全人类的解放作为自己唯一的奋斗目标，从无产阶级世界观的高度上，深刻理解和坚决贯彻毛主席对我们的要求。
