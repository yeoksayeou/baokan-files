The revolutionary cadres of Shanghai Bolt Factory No. 8 have taken Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, and with great enthusiasm, have done painstaking political work to educate and unite the majority of the masses who were misled, helping them to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The ranks of the revolutionary cadres have continuously grown. The entire factory has achieved revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination." The results of grasping the revolution and promoting production are remarkable, with monthly over-fulfillment of production tasks this year. From January to May, the output increased by 34 percent compared to the same period last year.

Rely on Persuasion, Not Force

In January of this year, with the fall of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the conservative organization, the Red Guards, changed its name and reformed as the "Starfire Combat Team." In reality, the organization remained the same, and their thoughts were unchanged, still opposing the revolutionary organization, the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps. At this time, some members of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps advocated, "We should really give them a good beating!" Some even advocated smashing this conservative organization.

How should this problem be handled? The Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps organized its members to study the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's relevant instructions.

Chairman Mao taught: "All issues of a ideological nature, all issues of internal disputes among the people, can only be resolved through democratic methods, only through methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not through coercive and forceful methods." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, the comrades of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps realized that smashing the conservative organization is the simplest method, but smashing their office does not change their thoughts. Only by helping them change their political direction from an ideological standpoint and returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the best method. Therefore, the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, on one hand, launched a powerful political offensive, exposing the situation where the original Red Guards were manipulated by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and distinguishing between the few bad elements and the general members among the leaders of the original Red Guards; on the other hand, they actively approached those original Red Guards members who were leaning towards the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, helping them ideologically, repeatedly arousing their class consciousness, and urging them to rebel from within. As a result, some members publicly announced their withdrawal from the "Starfire Combat Team."

Major Issues Must Be Clarified, Minor Issues Need Not Be Calculated

"The major issues must be clarified, and the minor issues need not be calculated." The Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps adhered to this principle, generally not calculating the rumors spread by the original Red Guards members; but for principle issues, they used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to clarify right and wrong, raising the awareness of the misled masses.

Once, a core member of the "Starfire Combat Team" said: "Our factory's Red Guards and your Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps are consistent in the big direction." The comrades of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps clearly pointed out with irrefutable facts that the big direction of the original Red Guards was completely wrong. This core member, facing the facts, realized he had joined the wrong side, and voluntarily proposed to disband the "Starfire Combat Team," actively approaching and joining the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps.

In this way, many non-principled disputes were avoided, and the misled masses were fundamentally educated and united.

No Discrimination When Unenlightened, Encouragement When Progress Made

The revolutionary comrades, towards the misled masses, did not discriminate in daily life, and every time they made a little progress, they enthusiastically encouraged them.

When the Red Guards just collapsed, some members of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps often used terms like "Red Guards" to ridicule the original Red Guards members. The Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps organized its members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, encouraging everyone to "be good at uniting those who have different opinions from you, and also be good at uniting those who have opposed you and have been proven wrong by practice." Some comrades in the committee said in a discussion meeting: "Things are always developing. If you see people as fixed, then you commit the error of one-sidedness, narrow-mindedness, and metaphysics as pointed out in the 'Sixteen Points.'"

After everyone reached a consensus, terms like "Red Guards" were no longer used, and they could encourage and support the progress of the misled masses according to the principle that revolution does not distinguish between early and late comers.

The Most Fundamental Thing Is to Infuse Mao Zedong Thought

The comrades of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, when doing political and ideological work towards the misled masses, relied on the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They studied Chairman Mao's works "Study and the Current Situation" with the original Red Guards members, encouraging them to put down their ideological burdens and boldly rebel.

A young man who had just graduated from school was misled into joining the Red Guards and became the deputy leader of the factory's Red Guards. At first, he did not admit his mistake. The comrades of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps talked to him twice, but both times they hit a wall; later, they enthusiastically had an intimate talk with him, studying with him Chairman Mao's teachings on opposing slavishness, making him realize that blindly following the leaders of the municipal and district Red Guards, participating in their conspiratorial activities, actually played a bad role in protecting a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and opposing the revolutionary cadres. However, he still had reservations in his mind, daring not to rebel, fearing that others would say he was a "traitor," "raising the white flag." The comrades of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, targeting this thought, studied with him again Chairman Mao's teachings on insisting on truth and correcting errors, enlightening him to realize that being a "traitor" to the bourgeois reactionary line is a revolutionary action, a glorious thing, and not a matter of "raising the white flag" at all. Thus, he examined his mistakes and applied to join the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, actively participating in the struggle to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

    用毛泽东思想教育和团结群众
    上海螺帽八厂革命派帮助大多数受蒙蔽的群众站到毛主席革命路线上来
    本报讯　上海螺帽八厂无产阶级革命派用毛泽东思想挂帅，满腔热情地对受蒙蔽的群众做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，争取和团结了绝大多数原赤卫队队员站到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，革命派的队伍不断壮大。全厂实现了革命的大联合和“三结合”。抓革命促生产成绩显著，今年月月超额完成生产任务，一至五月的产量，比去年同期增加百分之三十四。
            靠说服　不靠压服
    今年一月，随着旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的垮台，这个厂的保守组织赤卫队改头换面成立了“星火战斗队”。其实组织上还是原班人马，思想上也原封未动，与革命组织工人革命造反队，仍然处于对立的地位。这时，工人革命造反队的有些队员主张“好好地整一整他们！”有的还主张砸掉这个保守组织。
    究竟如何对待这个问题呢？工人革命造反队队委组织队员们学习了“十六条”和毛主席的有关教导。
    毛主席教导说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”根据毛主席的教导，工人革命造反队的同志们认识到，对待保守组织，砸的方法最简便，但是砸了他们的办公室，并不能改变他们的思想。只有从思想上帮助他们扭转了政治方向，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，才是最好的办法。于是，工人革命造反队一方面展开强大的政治攻势，揭露原赤卫队受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的情况，并把原赤卫队的头头中的少数坏分子和一般队员区别开来；一方面主动地接近那些靠拢工人革命造反队的原赤卫队员，从思想上帮助他们，反复地启发他们的阶级觉悟，促使他们从内部起来革命造反。这样做的结果，有些队员公开宣布退出了“星火战斗队”。
      大是大非要辨明　小是小非不计较
    “大是大非要弄明白，小是小非就不去计较。”工人革命造反队本着这个原则，对于原赤卫队队员所散布的流言蜚语，一般都不去计较；而对于原则问题，则通过摆事实、讲道理的方法辨明是非，提高受蒙蔽群众的觉悟。
    有一次，“星火战斗队”的一个骨干队员说：“我们厂里的赤卫队同你们工人革命造反队在大方向上是一致的。”工人革命造反队的同志，就毫不含糊地用不可辩驳的事实，一条一条地说明原赤卫队的大方向完全错了。这个骨干队员在事实面前，认清自己站错了队，就主动提出要求解散“星火战斗队”，自己并用行动积极靠拢工人革命造反队。
    这样，就避免了许多无原则纠纷，并且从根本上教育和团结了受蒙蔽的群众。
      没觉悟时不歧视有了进步就鼓励
    革命派同志，对于受蒙蔽的群众，平时不歧视，而且每当他们有了点滴进步，就热情地加以鼓励。
    当赤卫队刚垮台的时候，工人革命造反队有的队员往往用“赤字头”一类的称呼，去讽刺原赤卫队队员。工人革命造反队队委会组织队员们学习了毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导，鼓励大家“要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”有的队委在讨论会上说：“事物总是发展的。如果把人看死了，那就犯了‘十六条’所指出的片面性、局限性和形而上学的错误了。”
    大家统一认识以后，“赤字头”等称呼就再没人叫了，而且能根据革命不分先后的原则，鼓励和支持受蒙蔽群众的点滴进步。
        最根本的是灌输毛泽东思想
    工人革命造反队同志，在向受蒙蔽的群众做政治思想工作的时候，靠的是光焰无际的毛泽东思想。他们同原赤卫队队员一起学习毛主席著作《学习和时局》，启发他们放下思想包袱，大胆起来革命。
    一个刚从学校出来的青年，受蒙蔽参加了赤卫队，并且当了厂里赤卫队的副队长。开始，他不承认自己犯了错误。工人革命造反队同志两次找他谈心，都碰了钉子；后来又热忱地同他促膝谈心，和他一起学习毛主席关于反对奴隶主义的教导，使他认识到盲目地跟着市、区赤卫队的头头转，参加他们指挥的阴谋活动，实际上就起了保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和反对革命派的坏作用。但是，他思想上还有顾虑，不敢起来革命，怕别人说他是“叛徒”，“扯白旗”。工人革命造反队同志又针对他这种思想，又同他一起学习毛主席关于坚持真理、修正错误的语录，启发他认识到，做资产阶级反动路线的“叛徒”，是革命行动，是光荣的事情，根本不是什么“扯白旗”的问题。于是，他检查了错误，而且申请参加工人革命造反队，积极投入揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争。
