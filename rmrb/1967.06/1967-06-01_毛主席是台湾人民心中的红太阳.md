A red sun has risen in the hearts of our compatriots in Taiwan!

The people of Taiwan, who have suffered so much, yearn for the great leader Chairman Mao and hold him in boundless love, respect, admiration, and loyalty.

Under the rule of the U.S.-Chiang clique, Taiwan is a land of darkness. The Chiang bandits fear most the lofty prestige of Chairman Mao penetrating the hearts of the Taiwanese people, and they fear most the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminating Taiwan. They strictly prohibit listening to broadcasts from the mainland, spreading news from the mainland, and threaten with arrest, imprisonment, torture, and even murder. But the revolutionary fervor of the Taiwanese people to yearn for the mainland and love Chairman Mao cannot be stopped. Many Taiwanese people risk their lives to listen to broadcasts from the mainland. Many families, in the evening, close their doors and windows tightly, turn the radio volume to the lowest, and gather around to listen to the voice of Beijing, to listen to the voice of Chairman Mao. When the opening melody of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, "The East Is Red," plays, they cannot help but whisper: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

The people of Taiwan enthusiastically welcome the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction on the mainland and deeply admire the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. They discuss in private: "The Communist Party is capable, it has transformed a country once called the 'Sick Man of East Asia' into a world-class power." The people of Taiwan generally feel that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, being a Chinese person is truly "a matter of pride and honor." After the news of China's five successful nuclear tests reached Taiwan, the broad masses of Taiwanese people were overjoyed and spread the word. Some people were so excited that they shed tears of joy. They said, "Chairman Mao truly boosts the morale of the Chinese people." Some people excitedly said, "For this alone, we will support Chairman Mao, we will shout long live Chairman Mao!" After China's first atomic bomb test, someone shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" in the streets. Although this person was arrested by the Chiang bandits, more and more slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Mao Zedong is our leader!" appeared in various places in Taiwan.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has had a significant impact on the people of Taiwan. Especially among Taiwanese youth students, when they talk about the Red Guards on the mainland destroying the Four Olds and establishing the Four News, and smashing the capitalist roaders within the party and all ghosts and monsters, they feel invigorated. They enthusiastically cheer, "The Cultural Revolution is truly wonderful!"

"Looking up at the Big Dipper, thinking of Chairman Mao in my heart." Despite the strict control of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, the people of Taiwan always find appropriate opportunities to express their longing for the mainland and Chairman Mao through various means. More than a year ago, Taiwanese sailors sent a letter of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao, which was sealed in a can and floated across the vast sea to our coastal beaches.

Another time, our coastal military and civilians found a note in the reactionary leaflets scattered by the enemy, on which a five-star national flag was drawn, and it was written: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" This small piece of paper expressed the aspirations of the broad masses of the people in Taiwan.

When the people of Taiwan come into contact with the people of the mainland, they always enthusiastically inquire about the situation of the socialist revolution and socialist construction on the mainland, and sincerely ask after the health of the great leader Chairman Mao. When they heard the news that Chairman Mao, over seventy years old, swam in the Yangtze River, they all felt immense joy. Once, our revolutionary masses met Taiwanese compatriots in a certain place and held up high the portrait of Chairman Mao and the books of Chairman Mao, saying to them: "Dear compatriots: the people of the mainland care about you and have brought you the portrait of Chairman Mao and the books of Chairman Mao." The Taiwanese compatriots were very happy and immediately approached us. One Taiwanese compatriot quickly wiped his hands clean and respectfully took the portrait of Chairman Mao and the books of Chairman Mao, expressing his gratitude over and over again. The people standing behind shouted excitedly: "Quickly hold up the portrait of Chairman Mao for everyone to see!" They held the portrait of Chairman Mao high above their heads, and dozens of eyes looked at Chairman Mao with boundless admiration, bursting out with a thousand words into a resounding slogan: "Long live Chairman Mao!" The Taiwanese compatriots expressed that they would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and go back to read his books carefully.

Chairman Mao is the great savior of all suffering people, and Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for all oppressed people to make revolution and seek liberation, and it is a powerful ideological weapon for the people of Taiwan to carry out their anti-American patriotic struggle. The broad masses of the people of Taiwan firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, "to be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." With great revolutionary spirit, they are fighting bravely, one after another, to drive out the American invaders and liberate Taiwan, the territory of our motherland. In late March of this year, more than 7,000 farmers in the Fengshan area of Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, held a demonstration against the U.S.-Chiang bandits. When the Chiang bandit military police and special agents pointed their guns at the crowd, the farmers fearlessly shouted Mao's quotations: "To be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The crowd was stirred, and the roar shook the heavens, causing the Chiang bandit officials, military police, and special agents to be terrified and forced to announce "to consider it further."

The red sun rises, and the morning glow is endless. Chairman Mao, you are the reddest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world, you are the reddest red sun in the hearts of the people of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan will definitely use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to dispel the clouds in the sky and drive away the wolves on the ground. We will definitely liberate Taiwan and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, with its boundless flames, forever fly high over the beloved island of Taiwan in our motherland.

    毛主席是台湾人民心中的红太阳
    曙光
    一轮红日在台湾同胞的心中升起！
    苦难深重的台湾同胞，想念伟大领袖毛主席，对毛主席寄以无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深情。
    在美蒋统治下的台湾省，是一片黑暗世界。蒋匪帮最害怕毛主席的崇高威望深入台湾人心，最害怕毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀台湾。它严禁收听祖国大陆的广播，传播大陆的消息，以逮捕关押、毒刑拷打、甚至杀害相威胁。但是台湾同胞向往祖国大陆、热爱毛主席的革命热情是阻挡不了的。许多台湾同胞宁肯冒着生命的危险，千方百计地收听祖国大陆的广播。许多人家在晚上紧闭门窗，把收音机音量放到最小程度，全家人围坐在一起，屏声静气地收听北京的声音，收听毛主席的声音。当中央人民广播电台的开始曲《东方红》乐曲响起的时候，他们情不自禁地轻声喊道：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    台湾同胞热烈欢呼祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，衷心敬佩伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。他们私下议论：“共产党就是要得，就是有本事，把一个被称为‘东亚病夫’的国家变成了世界头等强国。”台湾同胞普遍感到：在毛主席领导下做个中国人，真是“扬眉吐气，脸上光彩”。我国五次核爆炸成功的消息传到台湾后，广大台湾同胞无不为之欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，有的人兴奋得流下热泪。他们说：“毛主席真能长中国人的志气。”有的人激动地说：“就凭这件事，我们也要拥护毛主席，我们也要喊毛主席万岁！”我国第一颗原子弹爆炸后，就有人在马路上当众高呼：“毛主席万岁！”这个人虽然被蒋匪帮抓进了监狱，可是在台湾各地不断出现更多的“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东是我们的领袖”的标语。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在台湾同胞中引起很大的反响。尤其是台湾青年学生谈起大陆红卫兵破四旧立四新，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神的反，无不感到振奋，他们热情欢呼：“文化大革命真是好得很！”
    “抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛主席”。尽管美蒋反动派控制非常严密，台湾同胞总能找到适当的机会，利用种种方式，来表达他们怀念祖国大陆、怀念毛主席的深切心情。一年多以前，台湾海员给伟大领袖毛主席写来了一封致敬信，这封信是装在一个密封的罐头盒里，越过波浪滔滔的大海漂到我沿海海滩上的。
    又有一次，我沿海军民从敌人散发过来的反动传单中，发现了一个纸条，上面画了一面五星国旗，写道：“中华人民共和国万岁！”这张小小的纸条，表达了台湾广大人民群众的人心所向。
    台湾同胞在和祖国大陆人民接触的时候，总是热情打听祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的情况，殷切地问候伟大领袖毛主席的健康。当他们知道毛主席七十多岁畅游长江的消息后，都感到莫大的喜悦。有一次，我革命群众在某地遇见了台湾同胞，就把毛主席的像和毛主席的书高高举起，对他们说道：“亲爱的同胞们：大陆同胞关心你们，给你们送来了毛主席像和毛主席的书。”台湾同胞听了以后，非常高兴，立即靠近我们。有一个台湾同胞马上擦干净了手，非常敬重地把毛主席的像和毛主席的书接过去，再三表示感谢。站在后边的人激动地喊道：“快把毛主席像举起来大家看！”他们把毛主席的像高高举过头顶，几十只眼睛无限敬仰地望着毛主席，千言万语迸发出一句响亮的口号：“毛主席万岁！”台湾同胞们表示要永远忠于毛主席他老人家，回去要好好读他老人家的书。
    毛主席是一切苦难人民的大救星，毛泽东思想是一切受压迫人民闹革命、求解放的灯塔，是台湾同胞进行反美爱国斗争的强大思想武器。广大台湾同胞牢记毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，正以大无畏的革命精神，前赴后继，为赶走美国侵略者，解放祖国的领土台湾，进行着英勇的斗争。今年三月下旬，台湾高雄县凤山地区农民七千多人举行反抗美蒋匪帮的示威。当蒋匪帮军警特务把枪口对准人群时，农民们毫不畏惧，高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”群情激昂，吼声震天，使蒋匪帮官员、军警吓破了胆，不得不宣布“从长计议”。
    红日东升，朝霞万丈。毛主席啊，你是中国人民和世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳，你是台湾人民心中最红最红的红太阳。台湾人民一定要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，驱散天上的乌云，赶走地上的豺狼。我们一定要解放台湾，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在祖国可爱的台湾岛上永远高高飘扬。
