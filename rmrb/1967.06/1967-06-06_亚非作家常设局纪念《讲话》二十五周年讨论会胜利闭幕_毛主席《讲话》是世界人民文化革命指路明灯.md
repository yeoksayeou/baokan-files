New China News Agency, June 5th: The first and largest-scale international event to discuss Chairman Mao's works—the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau's "Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" conference—lasted six days and concluded tonight with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

This conference, attended by writers and friends from 34 countries and regions, fully expressed the determination of revolutionary and progressive writers from Asia, Africa, and the world to use Chairman Mao's "Talks" as an invincible ideological weapon to resolutely fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. The success of this conference is a concrete manifestation of the world's revolutionary people entering a completely new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. It will have a tremendous impact on the world's revolutionary people learning, mastering, and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and will drive revolutionary and progressive writers from Asia, Africa, and the world forward along Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line!

When they entered the venue, the writers and friends from various countries stood up and applauded warmly for a long time, shouting: "Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Zhou Enlai and others waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and greeted everyone warmly.

Secretary-General Sennanayak of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau read the letter of tribute to Chairman Mao unanimously adopted by the conference (full text on page 2). The letter said that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" by the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist "has epoch-making and world-historical significance." "This great work is the guiding light for the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the world's people's cultural revolution." "Mao Zedong Thought is our powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries. Under the inspiration and guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary literary and artistic movement, especially the Afro-Asian writers' movement, will definitely achieve the sacred goal of serving the revolutionary people and struggles of Asia, Africa, and the world. We place all our hopes in you—Chairman Mao—to lead our revolutionary struggle."

After reading the letter, Sennanayak requested that Premier Zhou deliver the "Letter of Tribute to Chairman Mao" to Chairman Mao. At this moment, the writers and friends from various countries stood up, facing the giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging high in the front of the venue, and gave a long, thunderous applause, shouting repeatedly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

After receiving the "Letter of Tribute to Chairman Mao," Premier Zhou Enlai said, "I am grateful for the conference giving me this honorable task. I will definitely deliver this letter to the great leader Chairman Mao. This letter is filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, boundless hatred for the enemy, and boundless confidence in the revolutionary cause. It is a letter full of fighting spirit."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "Comrades and friends: Let us unite, fight, and win together in the face of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries!"

Premier Zhou Enlai congratulated the success of the conference!

Premier Zhou Enlai finally shouted: "Down with American imperialism! Down with British imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with reactionaries in various countries! Victory to Vietnam! Victory to the Arab people! Victory to the people of Asia and Africa! Victory to the world's revolutionary people! Long live the boundless Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

At this moment, the writers and friends from various countries waved the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted repeatedly: "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Down with reactionaries in various countries! Long live the great unity of the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa! It is right to rebel against the people of Asia and Africa! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Before the closing ceremony, a plenary session was held, and the call issued by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau was adopted (full text on page 2). The call urged revolutionary and progressive writers from Asia, Africa, and the world to study Chairman Mao's great works diligently, study the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Chairman Mao's most revolutionary poems; hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, mobilize billions of people to denounce and criticize, and launch a fierce attack on imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary literature. The call urged revolutionary and progressive writers from Asia, Africa, and the world to make up their minds, go to the factories, go to the countryside, go to the battlefields filled with gunpowder, share weal and woe with the workers and peasants, fight shoulder to shoulder, create heroic images of the great masses of workers and peasants and people's armed forces loved by the people of Asia and Africa, and open up a brilliant new era for revolutionary literature and art in Asia and Africa.

At the closing ceremony, it was announced that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau decided to award Mao badges to revolutionary and progressive writers from Asia, Africa, and other countries to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The closing ceremony began at 9 PM. Writers and friends from various countries held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people of the world, unite and defeat American aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must dare to struggle, must not fear sacrifices, and must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be driven out." "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to use."

At the beginning of the closing ceremony, Sennanayak spoke first. He said that this conference was very successful and historically significant. Representatives of revolutionary writers from Asia, Africa, and 34 other countries and regions at the conference clearly and unambiguously expressed their highest evaluation and boundless love for Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks." The conference vividly reflected the enthusiasm of revolutionary writers and people from various countries in studying Mao Zedong Thought.

He said that this conference is a milestone in the Afro-Asian writers' movement. Revolutionary writers from Asia, Africa, and various countries firmly believe that the brilliant ideas and teachings of Chairman Mao's "Talks" are the only path that revolutionary writers in the world must take in their struggle against oppressed peoples and nations for national liberation. He stated that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau reaffirms its resolute stand in the fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. He said that we strongly oppose American imperialism and will resolutely fight against Soviet modern revisionists who attempt to split and betray the world's revolutionary cause. We firmly defend the people's revolutionary cause.

Sennanayak then announced: The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau decided that the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference will be held in Beijing in November this year.

Following this, Chen Biao, a member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, was invited to deliver a long speech (full text on pages 3 and 4). He said that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" brilliantly and creatively developed Marxist-Leninist literary theory based on Marxist-Leninist principles, providing the proletariat in struggle with the most complete, systematic, and correct revolutionary literary line.

Chen Biao said that after the publication of this brilliant work by Chairman Mao, Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic workers, under the guidance of this revolutionary literary line, clarified their combat goals and found their direction; many excellent literary and artistic workers, following Chairman Mao's instructions, used literature and art as a weapon to serve the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, and in the flames of national liberation and people's liberation, tempered themselves into steadfast revolutionary fighters.

Chen Biao said that Chairman Mao's "Talks" are the program for our unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, preparing comprehensive and systematic theories, lines, policies, and guidelines for our proletarian cultural revolution.

He said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution greatly developed Marxism-Leninism, revealing a new universal truth to people: In a socialist society, under the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle does not die out but continues to deepen with the content of restoration and anti-restoration struggle; revolution does not end but continues in new forms. In the new era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory, as a true Marxist-Leninist, one must not only acknowledge class struggle but also acknowledge the dictatorship of the proletariat, acknowledge the existence of restoration and anti-restoration struggles under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's theory of cultural revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat has pointed the way for the international communist movement and is the guiding light for the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the proletariat in various countries.

In his speech, Chen Biao strongly refuted the attacks by imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist clique on our great leader Chairman Mao and refuted their slanders against the great proletarian cultural revolution in China. He said that being opposed by the enemy is not a bad thing but a great thing. Their vicious attacks on Chairman Mao further prove the greatness and correctness of the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao. It proves that the great helmsman of the proletarian revolution, Chairman Mao, not only points the way and path for the Chinese revolution but also points the way and path for the people under modern revisionist rule. He said that the Soviet revisionist clique's frenzied attacks on our beloved leader Chairman Mao show that they fear the Soviet people being influenced by the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, grasping the great Mao Zedong Thought weapon, rising up to rebel against them, and overthrowing them. The Soviet revisionists' attacks and insults on our great leader Chairman Mao are merely the last few desperate wails of a few flies at the end of their rope, which do not diminish the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought in the slightest.

Chen Biao said that the "Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" conference held by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau was a very successful and unprecedented grand conference. The success of this conference is a concrete manifestation of the world's people entering a completely new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, marking the Afro-Asian writers' movement entering a new stage, and showing that Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line and literary theory are becoming powerful ideological weapons for the people of various countries to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

Chen Biao condemned American imperialism's military and cultural invasions of the Asia and Africa regions, condemned the Soviet revisionist clique's role as imperialist lackeys, actively carrying out cultural infiltration in the Asia and Africa regions, promoting traitor literature, advocating surrenderism, and helping imperialism suppress and destroy the revolutionary movements of the people of Asia and Africa.

He said that under this situation, the first and foremost important task facing progressive writers in Asia and Africa is to use Chairman Mao's "Talks" as an invincible ideological weapon to fight against imperialist cultural invasions and fight against modern revisionism and reactionaries in various countries.

Chen Biao said that Chairman Mao teaches us: We must fight the enemy with a counter-offensive. The enemy's two-pronged counter-revolutionary policy must be countered with a two-pronged revolutionary policy. The enemy has military and cultural fronts, and revolutionary people must also establish military and cultural fronts. To defeat imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, we must first organize and strengthen the people's army, relying on the people's army with guns. The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. Without the people's army, there is nothing for the people. "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Only with guns can we seize power and consolidate power. However, having such an army is not enough; we also need a cultural army, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy. In the Asia and Africa regions, this army is not only a powerful tool for seizing power but also a powerful tool for smashing imperialist cultural invasions.

Chen Biao said that the people of Asia and Africa have awakened and are carrying out a magnificent revolutionary struggle. We believe that the brilliant and splendid new cultural era of the people of Asia and Africa will definitely arrive in the flames of national liberation and people's revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia and Africa! Let us advance along the revolutionary literary line opened up by the great leader Chairman Mao.

The head of the Chinese Writers' Delegation, Guo Moruo, delivered the closing address (full text on page 4), warmly congratulating the great success of this conference to study Chairman Mao's works. He said that although our conference has ended, our study has not ended. We must learn and practice. We must learn from Chairman Mao's practical spirit. We must be practitioners, not empty talkers. Learn and then use, learn urgently when needed, and only then can we achieve active learning and application. He wished the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, to be held in Beijing in November, even greater success.

At the end of the closing ceremony, the writers and friends from various countries again shouted for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and sang "The East Is Red" in unison.

    这次有三十四个国家和地区的作家和朋友参加的讨论会，充分表达了亚非和世界各国革命、进步作家要运用毛主席的《讲话》这个威力无穷的思想武器，同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行坚决斗争的决心。这次讨论会的成功，是全世界革命人民正进入一个完全崭新的以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代的具体表现。它将对全世界革命人民学习、掌握、运用毛泽东思想产生巨大的影响，将推动亚非和世界各国革命、进步作家沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线，勇往直前！
    中央领导同志、中央文革小组成员和其他有关方面负责人周恩来、陈伯达、康生、谢富治、江青、萧华、杨成武、王力、关锋、戚本禹、穆欣、叶群、汪东兴、楚图南等同志，出席了闭幕式。当他们走进会场的时候，各国作家和朋友一致起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌，并且高呼：“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”周恩来等同志挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向大家亲切致意。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克宣读了大会一致通过的给毛主席的致敬信（全文见第二版）。致敬信中说，当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》“具有伟大的划时代的世界意义。”“这部伟大的著作是亚非作家运动和全世界人民文化革命的指路明灯。”“毛泽东思想是我们反对帝国主义，现代修正主义和反动派的强大的思想武器。在毛泽东思想的鼓舞和指导下，革命文学艺术家运动，特别是亚非作家运动一定能够达到为亚非以及全世界革命人民和革命斗争服务的神圣目的。我们对您——毛主席，寄予领导我们革命斗争的一切希望。”
    宣读后，森纳那亚克请周恩来总理把《给毛主席的致敬信》转交给毛泽东主席。这时，各国作家和朋友一致起立，面向高悬在会场正前方的毛主席巨幅画像，发出长时间的暴风雨般的热烈掌声，连续高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    周恩来总理接过《给毛主席的致敬信》以后说，感谢大会给我这个光荣任务，我一定把这封信转给伟大领袖毛主席。这封信充满了对毛主席的无限热爱，充满了对敌人的愤恨，充满了对革命事业的无限信心，这是一封具有战斗精神的信。
    周恩来总理说，同志们、朋友们：让我们在帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派面前团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    周恩来总理祝贺讨论会的成功！
    周恩来总理最后高呼：“美帝必败！”“英帝必败！”“苏修必败！”“各国反动派必败！”“越南必胜！”“阿拉伯人民必胜！”“亚非人民必胜！”“世界革命人民必胜！”“光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”　　　　　　　
    这时，各国作家和朋友挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不断地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒各国反动派！”“亚非革命人民大团结万岁！”“亚非人民造反有理！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在闭幕式以前举行的全体会议上，通过了亚非作家常设局发出的号召书（全文见第二版）。号召书中号召亚非和世界各国的革命进步作家努力学习毛主席的伟大著作，学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛主席最富有革命性的诗词；高举革命的批判的大旗，动员亿万群众口诛笔伐，向帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动文艺发动勇猛的进攻。号召书号召亚非和世界各国革命进步作家下定决心，到工厂去，到农村去，到硝烟滚滚的战场上去，与工农群众同甘共苦，并肩战斗，塑造出亚非人民所喜爱的、高大的工农大众和人民武装的英雄形象，开辟亚非革命文艺的光辉灿烂的新纪元。
    闭幕仪式上，宣布了亚非作家常设局为纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，向亚非和其他国家革命、进步作家颁发毛主席像章的决定。
    闭幕式在今晚九时举行。各国作家和朋友手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，学习毛主席的教导：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    闭幕式开始时，森纳那亚克首先致词。他说，这次讨论会获得很大成功，具有历史意义。来自亚非和世界上三十四个国家和地区的革命作家的代表们在讨论会上明确地、毫不含糊地表达了他们对毛主席的《讲话》这部光辉著作所作的最高评价和无比热爱。讨论会上生动地反映了各国革命作家和人民学习毛泽东思想的热情。
    他说，这次讨论会是亚非作家运动的里程碑。亚非和各国革命作家深信毛主席《讲话》的光辉思想和教导，是世界革命作家同被压迫人民和民族争取民族解放斗争所必须走的唯一的道路。他表示，亚非作家常设局重申坚决站在反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的战斗立场。他说，我们强烈地反对美帝国主义，我们要对企图分裂和出卖世界人民革命事业的苏联现代修正主义分子进行坚决斗争。我们坚决维护人民的革命事业。
    森纳那亚克随后宣布：亚非作家常设局决定，第三届亚非作家大会于今年十一月份在北京召开。
    接着，中央文革小组成员戚本禹同志应邀发表了长篇讲话（全文见第三、四版）。他说，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》根据马克思列宁主义的原理，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论，为在斗争中的无产阶级提出了一条最完整、最系统、最正确的无产阶级革命文艺路线。
    戚本禹说，毛主席这部光辉著作发表以后，中国革命文艺工作者在这条革命文艺路线的指引下，明确了战斗目标，找到了方向；很多优秀的文艺工作者，按照毛主席的指示，用文艺这个武器，为抗日战争、解放战争服务，在民族解放和人民解放的烽火中，锻炼成为坚强的革命战士。
    戚本禹说，毛主席的《讲话》是我们今天史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，《讲话》为我们的无产阶级文化大革命准备了全面的系统的理论、路线、方针和政策。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命大大发展了马克思列宁主义，它向人们揭示了一个崭新的普遍真理：在社会主义社会，在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期，阶级斗争不是熄灭了，而是以复辟和反复辟斗争为主要内容继续深入地进行着；革命不是结束了，而是以新的形式进行着。在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的新时代，作为一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，不仅要承认阶级斗争，而且要承认无产阶级专政，要承认在无产阶级专政条件下，存在着复辟和反复辟的斗争。毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行文化大革命的理论，为国际共产主义运动指明了方向，是各国无产阶级反帝、反修斗争的指路明灯。
    戚本禹在讲话中，有力地反击了帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义集团对我们伟大领袖毛主席的攻击，驳斥了它们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑。他说，被敌人反对不是坏事，而是一件天大的好事。他们恶毒地攻击毛主席，这就更加证明了当代的列宁——毛主席的伟大与正确。证明了伟大的无产阶级革命的舵手毛主席，不仅为中国革命指出了方向和道路，而且现代修正主义统治下的革命的人民也认为毛主席为他们指明了革命的方向和道路。他说，苏联修正主义集团疯狂攻击我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，说明他们害怕苏联人民受了中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，掌握伟大的毛泽东思想的武器，起来造他们的反，赶他们下台。苏修对我们伟大领袖毛主席的攻击和谩骂，只不过是几只穷途末路的苍蝇最后发出的几声凄厉的抽泣而已，丝毫无损于伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。
    戚本禹说，这次亚非作家常设局举办的“纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年讨论会”，是一次十分成功的盛况空前的讨论会。这次会议的成功，是全世界人民正进入一个完全崭新的以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代的具体表现，标志着亚非作家运动进入了一个新阶段，显示着毛主席的革命文艺路线和文艺理论，正在成为世界各国人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派的威力强大的思想武器。
    戚本禹谴责了美帝国主义对亚非地区进行军事和文化侵略，谴责苏联修正主义集团充当帝国主义的帮凶，积极在亚非地区进行文化渗透，推销叛徒文学，宣扬投降主义，帮助帝国主义镇压和破坏亚非人民的革命运动的罪行。
    他说，在这种形势下，摆在亚非进步作家面前的一个头等重要的任务，就是运用毛主席《讲话》这个威力无穷的思想武器，去同帝国主义的文化侵略作斗争，同现代修正主义和各国反动派作斗争。
    戚本禹说，毛主席教导我们：对待敌人必须进行针锋相对的斗争。敌人的反革命两手政策，必须用革命的两手政策去进行反击。敌人有文武两个战线，革命人民也必须建立文武两个战线。我们要打败帝国主义和各国反动派，首先要组织和壮大人民的军队，依靠手里拿枪的人民军队。革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。没有人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。“枪杆子里面出政权”，只有有了枪杆子，才能夺取政权，巩固政权。但是，仅仅有了这种军队还不够，还需要有一支文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。这支军队在亚非地区来说，它既是夺取政权的强大工具之一，又是粉碎帝国主义文化侵略的强大工具之一。
    戚本禹说，现在亚非人民已经觉醒，正在进行着轰轰烈烈的革命斗争。我们相信，亚非人民的先进的光辉灿烂的文化新时代，一定会在亚非人民民族解放和人民革命斗争的烽火中到来！让我们沿着伟大领袖毛主席开辟的革命文艺路线阔步前进吧。
    中国作家代表团团长郭沫若致闭幕词（全文见第四版），热烈祝贺这次学习毛主席著作的讨论会获得很大的成功。他说，我们的讨论会虽然结束了，但我们的学习并没有结束。学了还要用，还要实践。我们要做毛主席的好学生，就要向毛主席的实践躬行精神学习。我们要做实行家，不要做空谈家。学了就用，用时急学，这样才能够做到活学活用。他预祝即将在十一月份在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会获得更大的胜利。
    闭幕式结束时，各国作家和朋友又一次长时间地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”并且齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
