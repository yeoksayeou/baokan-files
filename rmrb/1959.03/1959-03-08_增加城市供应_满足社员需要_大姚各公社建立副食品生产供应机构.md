Increase Urban Supply　Meet Commune Members' Needs
    Dwarf Yao Communes Establish Subsidiary Food Production and Supply Organizations
    (By this newspaper) How to meet the supply of non-staple foods in cities and industrial and mining areas, and also meet the requirements of the people's commune masses themselves? With this question in mind, the reporter interviewed the responsible persons of the Yao County Party Committee in Yunnan Province and the Party secretaries of the Dongchuan, Great Leap Forward, Yongding, Guangming, and Santai People's Communes.
    The comrades of the Yao County Party Committee said that in order to ensure the supply of non-staple foods to cities and industrial and mining areas, the County Party Committee established production units in September of last year in all twenty-one people's communes in the county to supply non-staple foods to cities and industrial and mining areas. The production situation in the past few months has been good. In a few more months, there will be more non-staple foods such as live pigs and vegetables supplied to the state, and the lives of the commune members will be even better. Wang Kaiji, the Party Secretary of the Great Leap Forward People's Commune, said: Since our commune established a specialized production unit to supply the state with non-staple foods, we have established sixteen pig farms specifically for the state, and now we have 12,000 pigs; there are also thirteen vegetable production teams, planting 1,000 mu of vegetables, specifically for external allocation. This work is managed by a Deputy Party Secretary.
    After the communes adopted this method, the task of transferring non-staple foods to the state was completed very well. For example, the Dongchuan People's Commune supplied the state with more than 600 live pigs, more than 40,000 jin of cellophane noodles, and more than 300,000 jin of dried vegetables and radishes in December last year alone. This year, they plan to supply the state with 10,000 to 15,000 live pigs, 10,000 ducks, 100,000 jin of fish, and 25 tons of cellophane noodles, and the lives of the local people have also been greatly improved.
    The Yao County Party Committee and the Party Committees of some People's Communes also frequently conduct socialist education for the commune members, asking them to produce more non-staple foods and sell more to the state. Most of the commune members consciously put the state first and the collective second. For example, the Qingling Production Team of the Dongchuan People's Commune was originally assigned the task of transferring only twenty-five live pigs. When this task was handed over to the commune members for discussion, they took out thirty fat pigs to sell to the state.

### 增加城市供应　满足社员需要  大姚各公社建立副食品生产供应机构

    增加城市供应　满足社员需要
    大姚各公社建立副食品生产供应机构
    本报讯　怎样满足城市和工矿区副食品的供应，又满足人民公社群众自己的要求？记者以此为题，访问了云南省大姚县委会的负责人和栋川、大跃进、永定、光明、三台等人民公社的党委书记。
    大姚县委会的同志说，为了保证城市和工矿区的副食品的供应，县委会在去年9月间就在全县二十一个人民公社里分别成立供应城市和工矿区副食品的生产单位，这几个月内的生产情况良好。再等几个月，生猪和蔬菜等副食品，供应国家的将会更多，社员的生活也会更好。大跃进人民公社的党委书记王开基说：我们公社自成立专门供应国家副食品的生产单位后，专门为国家成立了十六个养猪场，现在已养猪一万二千头；还有十三个蔬菜生产大队，种一千亩地蔬菜，专门对外调拨。这方面的工作，由一个党委副书记专门负责管理。
    各公社采取这个办法后，对国家上调副食品的任务完成的很好。如栋川人民公社，仅去年12月份就供应国家生猪六百多头，粉丝四万多斤，干菜和萝卜三十多万斤。今年他们计划供应国家的物资，生猪就有一万头到一万五千头，鸭子一万只，鱼十万斤，粉丝二十五吨，当地人民的生活也有了很大的改善。
    大姚县委会和一些人民公社的党委会，还经常对社员进行社会主义教育，要他们多生产副食品，多卖给国家。多数社员都自觉地提出要先国家后集体。如栋川人民公社蜻蛉生产队，原先只分配有二十五头生猪的上调任务，这项任务交给社员们讨论，结果就拿出肥猪三十头卖给国家。
