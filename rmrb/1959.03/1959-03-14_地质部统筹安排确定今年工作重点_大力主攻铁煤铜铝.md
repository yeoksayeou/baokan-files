Xinhua News Agency, March 13th:

    The National Geological Bureau Directors Conference, convened by the Ministry of Geology in Beijing, recently concluded. The conference determined that this year's priorities should be iron, coal, copper, and aluminum, to accelerate geological exploration work. At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the exploration of coal resources needed for cutting-edge industries, as well as mineral resources such as petroleum, chemicals, and building materials, in order to find more mineral raw material bases for the country as soon as possible.

    The conference particularly emphasized the acceleration of coalfield exploration in southern China and the Hexi Corridor area of Gansu. This year, provinces in the south will use about half of their technical force and drilling workload to prospect and explore coal mines, in order to guarantee the needs of the national coal industry base construction in the southern provinces this year. In the exploration of iron ore, in addition to ensuring the mineral resources needed by several large-scale iron and steel bases, it is also necessary to find medium-sized iron and steel bases required by local areas, especially to pay attention to finding high-grade and high-quality rich ores suitable for mining by small and medium-sized smelting enterprises. Provinces and regions with insufficient iron ore, such as Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Ningxia, should continue to investigate iron ore resources. In the exploration of copper and aluminum mines, in addition to finding more rich ores, attention should also be paid to places close to power sources and convenient transportation, in order to facilitate mining and utilization. Regarding rare metals, dispersed elements, and some urgently needed non-metallic mineral resources needed for the development of the country's cutting-edge industries, the conference required all regions to actively carry out exploration. In the exploration, it is necessary to strengthen the research on dispersed associated elements.

    The conference required all regions to give appropriate arrangements to petroleum resources and chemical and building industrial raw materials, especially chemical fertilizer resources, while arranging key mineral types. This year, petroleum geological prospecting work should blossom everywhere, and key breakthroughs should be made in those promising areas. The conference especially required attention to be paid to the exploration of industrially valuable oil fields in eastern and central China, so as to supply the oil needed by these regions in the vicinity. The conference believes that all regions must give appropriate arrangements to the exploration of chemical industrial raw materials, especially phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur mineral resources used to produce agricultural fertilizers, and mineral resources such as refractory materials for the building industry; the exploration of various auxiliary raw materials needed for steel production should also be given due attention; areas lacking water should continue to carry out regional hydrogeological surveys; this year, geological surveys for large-scale water conservancy and hydropower construction projects, hydrogeological work in mining areas, and groundwater observation work in coordination with agricultural water conservancy should also be appropriately strengthened.

    The conference believes that geological exploration work should be closely integrated with industrial construction, and the selection of exploration bases should pay attention to transportation conditions and the urgency of industrial construction needs, so that the proven mineral reserves can be utilized by industrial departments as easily as possible. In the future, geological exploration work should strive to develop in the direction of "more (more reserves), rich (rich ore grade, good quality), complete (the main mineral raw materials and their auxiliary raw materials are as complete as possible), and broad (wide distribution of resources)."

    In order to meet the requirements of industrial departments for geological work, the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard" must be implemented in the arrangement of work and the implementation of plans. It is required to give priority to ensuring key projects, while comprehensively arranging the needs of the metallurgical, coal, petroleum, cutting-edge, chemical, and building materials industries; to give priority to ensuring the urgent needs of the country, while comprehensively arranging large, medium, and small enterprises, and central and local industries.

    The conference finally pointed out that the mass prospecting work should be further consolidated and improved this year. It is required to vigorously carry out mass movements centered on technological revolution in the exploration teams, conscientiously implement "two participations, one reform, and three combinations"; at the same time, it is necessary to tap potential, try every means to overcome the difficulties in material supply, and complete and over fulfill the national plan.

    地质部统筹安排确定今年工作重点
    大力主攻铁煤铜铝
    新华社13日讯　地质部在北京召开的全国地质局长会议最近闭幕。会议确定今年要以铁、煤、铜铝为重点，加速地质勘查工作，同时也要抓紧尖端工业所需要的煤产资源，以及石油、化工、建筑材料等矿产资源的勘探工作，尽快地为国家找到更多的矿物原料基地。
    会议特别强调要加速我国南方和甘肃河西走廊地区的煤田勘查工作。今年南方各省将以一半左右的技术力量和钻探工作量普查和勘探煤矿，以保证今年国家在南方各省兴建煤炭工业基地的需要。在铁矿的勘查中，除了保证几个大型钢铁基地所需要的矿产资源外，同时还要寻找地方要求的中型钢铁基地，特别是要注意找适合中、小冶炼企业开采的品位高、质量好的富矿。青海、陕西、宁夏等铁矿不足的省区，还要继续查清铁矿资源。铜、铝矿的勘查，除了要多找富矿以外，还要注意靠近电源和交通方便的地方，以有利于开采使用。对于发展国家尖端工业所需要的稀有金属、分散元素及某些急需的非金属矿产资源，会议要求各地积极进行勘查，在勘查中，必须加强对分散性伴生元素的研究。
    会议要求各地在安排重点矿种的同时，对石油资源及化工、建筑工业原料，特别是化学农肥资源，也必须给予适当的安排。石油地质普查工作，今年要遍地开花，对那些有希望的地区要重点突破。会议特别要求注意在我国东部、中部勘查有工业价值的油田，以便就近供应这些地区所需要的石油。会议认为：各地对化学工业原料，特别是用来生产农业肥料的磷、钾、硫矿资源和建筑工业用的耐火材料等矿物资源的勘查工作，必须给予适当安排；钢铁生产所需要的各种辅助原料的勘查工作，也要给予应有的重视；缺水的地区要继续开展区域水文普查工作；大型水利电力建设工程地质勘测、矿区水文工作和配合农业水利化的地下水观测工作，今年也要适当加强。
    会议认为，地质勘查工作要紧密结合工业建设进行，选择勘探基地要注意交通条件和工业建设需要的轻重缓急，使探明的矿产储量，尽可能地便于工业部门利用，今后地质勘查工作要努力向“多（储量多）、富（矿石品位富、质量好）、全（主要矿物原料及其辅助原料尽可能齐全）、广（资源分布广泛）”方向发展。
    为了满足工业部门对地质工作的要求，在安排工作和执行计划中必须贯彻“全国一盘棋”的原则。要求在优先保证重点的前提下，统筹安排冶金、煤炭、石油、尖端及化工、建材工业各部门的需要；在优先保证国家急需的前提下，统筹安排大中小型企业、中央和地方工业。
    会议最后指出，群众性的普查找矿工作今年要进一步巩固提高。要求在勘查队中大力开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动，认真贯彻“两参、一改、三结合”；同时，必须挖掘潜力，想尽一切办法克服物资供应的困难，完成和超额完成国家计划。
