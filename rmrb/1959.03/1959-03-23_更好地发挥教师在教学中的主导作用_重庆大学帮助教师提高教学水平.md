    To Better Bring Out the Leading Role of Teachers in Teaching
    Chongqing University Helps Teachers Improve Their Teaching Level
    (Our Newspaper News) Chongqing University has recently made comprehensive arrangements to better bring out the role of teachers, to help them further improve their political and ideological level, and strengthen the link between theory and practice.
    When making comprehensive arrangements, in addition to continuing to strengthen and improve the organizational leadership of teaching work, it has also properly and carefully arranged the teaching and scientific research work of teachers according to their specialties and the needs of school development. Regarding the continued assistance to teachers in transforming their thinking, the focus is on organizing teachers to participate in labor training and strengthen the study of political theory, and attention is paid to organizing teachers to go deep into practice and the masses through various forms to enrich practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge.
    In helping teachers further strengthen ideological transformation and the practice of scientific research, Chongqing University has taken the following measures: First, it organizes teachers to participate in labor training. This year's decentralization is characterized by the fact that it can achieve the purpose of training, allowing teachers to participate in physical labor, and also taking into account the needs of business and increasing practical knowledge as much as possible. The vast majority of teachers are sent to factories and mines run by their own departments to work with students. Through joint labor with students, teachers can also further understand the needs of theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge in teaching, and better carry out teaching work. In order to give teachers a more practical sense of new science and technology, the school has also sent some teachers to large factories and mines outside the school to participate in labor training. For in-service teachers, short-term labor of one month has already begun this year. At present, the first batch of teachers from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering who are participating in short-term labor have gone to the factories run by the departments to work with the students. Second, on the basis of many teachers going deep into practice last year, this year teachers are further organized to cooperate with fixed factories and mines, and engage in scientific research with workers and engineering technicians. Some departments also organize teachers to go to factories and mines to conduct research and participate in labor appropriately. Six teachers from the Department of Mining have already gone to the mines to conduct research and labor. Third, in conjunction with the school's need to open new majors or new courses, teachers are sent to relevant factories and mines to conduct investigations and research, and master practical production knowledge through participation in certain production labor. On this basis, teaching materials and textbooks are compiled. The Department of Metallurgy is preparing to send teachers to steel mills in Shanghai and Tangshan to investigate and collect information on converter steelmaking. The Department of Mining will also send teachers to non-ferrous metal mines to conduct investigations, study, and labor.
    The Party organization of Chongqing University also pays special attention to strengthening the political theory study of teachers. In addition to arranging six hours of political theory study for teachers every week, the Party organization is also prepared to conduct regular education on the situation for teachers. Departments such as Electrical Engineering, Metallurgy, and Mining are also preparing to organize teachers who actively apply to join the Party to study the basic knowledge of the Party. The Party organizations of each department also care for and help teachers solve problems and difficulties in ideological methods and work methods in many ways. When the Party branch of the Department of Mechanical Engineering organized old teachers to go to factories and mines to engage in scientific research, it learned that although some old teachers had great enthusiasm, there were still problems with their ideological methods and work methods, and they could not go deep. It immediately helped them solve ideological problems, and at the same time began to transfer young teachers to assist them in solving some specific problems in in-depth work. An old professor in the Department of Mining initially lacked confidence in conducting on-site teaching in the mine. The Party branch of the department promptly encouraged him and helped him realize the benefits of doing so. He immediately went to the mine with young teachers and students, and also took the scientific research topic of "mechanization of thin coal seams" to the mine for research.
    After the school's comprehensive arrangements, the initiative and enthusiasm of the teachers are even higher. When discussing how to play a role, many teachers examined their past shortcomings of not being fully responsible for students, and successively formulated personal and teaching and research group's leap forward plans. Teachers in each department have gone out of the classroom to factories and on-site to seek experience and collect treasures, enrich and enrich teaching content, so that students can learn more comprehensive knowledge. After several days of hard work, the mathematics teaching and research group of the Department of Electrical Engineering completed the revision of the teaching syllabus ahead of schedule. The teachers immediately went to steel mills and machinery factories to collect materials and problems related to mathematics to compile teaching materials and conduct scientific research. More than a dozen teachers from the electrical engineering teaching and research group all went out and went to factories and mines in groups to investigate. Li Zuogao, an old professor in his sixties from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, took the initiative to devote his spare time to helping them translate Japanese materials in order to help young teachers and students speed up the completion of scientific research projects. Lecturer Yuan Maochang and others also took the initiative to take time out of their Sunday rest to explain the knowledge and materials related to elasticity mechanics research to young teachers and students.

### 更好地发挥教师在教学中的主导作用  重庆大学帮助教师提高教学水平

    更好地发挥教师在教学中的主导作用
    重庆大学帮助教师提高教学水平
    本报讯　重庆大学为了更好地发挥教师的作用，最近做了全面的安排，以帮助教师进一步提高政治思想水平，加强理论与实际的联系。
    在进行全面安排时，除继续加强与改进教学工作的组织领导外，并根据教师的专长和学校发展的需要，妥善周详地安排了他们的教学和科学研究等工作。对继续帮助教师改造思想方面，着重组织教师参加劳动锻炼和加强政治理论的学习，并注意通过各种形式组织教师深入实际、深入群众，丰富实际知识和理论知识。
    在帮助教师进一步加强思想改造和加强科学研究的实践方面，重庆大学采取了下面这些措施：第一，是组织教师参加劳动锻炼。今年下放的特点是，既能达到锻炼的目的，让教师参加体力劳动，又结合尽量照顾了业务、增加实际知识的需要而劳动。绝大部分教师都是下放到本系自办工厂、矿山去和学生一起劳动。教师通过与学生的共同劳动，也可以进一步了解教学上对理论知识与实际知识方面的需要，更好地进行教学工作。为使教师对新的科学技术更有实感，学校也派了部分教师到校外大型厂矿去参加劳动锻炼。对于在职教师，今年已经开始实行为期一月的短期劳动。目前机械系和电机系第一批参加短期劳动的教师已经下到系办的工厂和学生一道劳动。第二，是在去年许多教师纷纷深入实际的基础上，今年进一步组织教师与固定的厂矿协作，和工人、工程技术人员一道搞科学研究，有的系还组织教师下到厂矿去一边搞研究，一边适当参加劳动。采矿系就有六个教师已经下到矿山去边研究、边劳动去了。第三，是结合学校将新开专业或新开课程的需要，把教师派到有关的厂矿去作调查研究，并通过参加一定的生产劳动掌握生产实际知识。在这样的基础上来编写讲义和教材。冶金系准备派教师到上海、唐山一带的炼钢厂去调查和收集有关转炉炼钢的资料。采矿系也将派出教师到有色金属矿去边作调查、边学习、边劳动。
    重庆大学党组织还特别注意加强教师的政治理论学习。除了每星期给教师安排六小时的政治理论学习外，党组织还准备经常对教师们进行形势的教育。电机、冶金、采矿等系还准备组织积极申请入党的教师进行党的基本知识的学习。各系党组织还从多方面关怀和帮助教师们解决思想方法、工作方法上的问题和困难。机械系党总支在组织老教师下厂矿搞科学研究时，了解到有的老教师虽然劲头很大，但思想方法和工作方法还存在问题，深入不下去，就一面帮助他们解决思想方法问题，一面着手抽调年青教师协助他们解决一些深入工作上的具体问题。采矿系有一位老教授起初对到矿山去进行现场教学，信心不足，系党总支及时鼓励他，帮助他认识这样做的好处后，马上就和年青教师、学生一道下矿山去了，并且还把“薄煤层机械化”这个科学研究题目带到矿山去进行研究。
    经过学校的全面安排以后，教师们的主动性和积极性更高。许多教师在讨论如何发挥作用时，检查了自己过去对学生全面负责不够的缺点后，纷纷订出了个人和教研组的跃进规划。各系的教师都纷纷走出教室到工厂、到现场去寻经采宝，丰富与充实教学内容，使学生们能更全面地学得一些知识。电机系数学教研组经过几天奋战，提前完成了教学大纲的修订任务后，教师们马上又分别深入炼钢厂、机械厂去收集与数学有关的材料和问题来编写教材及进行科学研究。电工学教研组的十多个教师，全部出动，分组下厂矿调查。机械系六十多岁的老教授李祚膏为了帮助年青教师和学生加紧完成科学研究项目，主动抽业余时间帮助他们翻译日文资料。讲师袁懋昶等也主动抽出星期日的休息时间，给年青教师和学生讲解有关弹性力学研究的知识和资料。
