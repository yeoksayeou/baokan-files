Value Lies in "Amateurism"
　　Qin Li

    Since the people's communes were established, rural cultural troupes have become more active. In Zhejiang, I heard that most of the more than 600 people's communes have established amateur art organizations. This new type of cultural vanguard is active in the fields, streets, canteens, and meeting places, serving production and deeply loved by the masses. Their performance forms are diverse and popular with the masses. The program content closely revolves around the current central work, praising the advanced, encouraging enthusiasm, and drumming up support and paving the way for a greater upsurge in agricultural production, playing a significant role in promoting production and labor.

    These commune cultural troupes have a common and valuable characteristic: they are all amateur mass art organizations that do not separate from production. The troupe members are farmers. They have mastered both literary and martial arts, which not only promotes production but also enlivens rural cultural life. This is precisely the inheritance of the excellent tradition of the old liberated area cultural troupes. At that time, the cultural troupes fought and performed at the same time, labored and publicized at the same time. If the commune's amateur cultural troupe develops in the direction of "professionalization" and separates from production labor, then it is not worth promoting. The value of the commune cultural troupe lies in "amateurism," mainly engaging in production and engaging in art in their spare time. Only in this way can production not be delayed, and rich materials can be drawn from labor, and artistic activities can better promote production. The troupe members are first and foremost producers, and secondly artistic workers. The "main occupation" and "side occupation" must be clearly distinguished.

    贵在“业余”
    秦犁
    人民公社化以后，农村文工团更加活跃了。在浙江，我听说在六百多个人民公社里，大都成立了业余的文艺活动组织。这支新型的文化尖兵，活跃在田间、街头、食堂、会场，为生产服务，深受群众欢迎。他们演出的形式多种多样，为群众喜闻乐见。节目内容，都紧密地围绕着当前的中心工作，歌颂先进，鼓舞干劲，为更大的农业生产高潮擂鼓助阵、鸣锣开道，对生产和劳动起了不小的推动作用。
    这些公社文工团，有一个共同的可贵之处，就是：它们都是不脱离生产的群众业余文艺组织。文工团员就是农民。他们练得一身文武双全的武艺，既促进了生产，又活跃了农村文化生活。这正是继承了老解放区文工团的优良传统。那时的文工团，就是一边战斗，一边演出；一边劳动，一边宣传的。如果公社业余文工团，向“专业化”的方向发展，脱离生产劳动，那就不值得提倡了。公社文工团，贵在“业余”，主要搞生产，业余闹文艺，这才能不误生产，并从劳动中汲取丰富的题材，也才能使文艺活动更好地促进生产。文工团员们首先是生产者，其次才是文艺工作者。“正业”和“副业”是一定要划分清楚的。
