Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 26th: The German News Agency reported that the government of the German Democratic Republic delivered a reply to the Soviet government's March 2nd note to the Soviet government on March 26th.

The reply stated that the government of the German Democratic Republic agrees with the arguments and constructive opinions held in the Soviet government's March 2nd note, and supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a top-level meeting, believing that this meeting is the most appropriate method to reach a positive agreement under current conditions.

The German Democratic Republic hopes that the top-level meeting can reach agreements on some important and pressing issues, including preparing for the convening of a peace conference to conclude a German peace treaty and normalizing the situation in West Berlin.

In the reply, the government of the German Democratic Republic expressed its agreement with the Soviet government's proposal that Poland and Czechoslovakia should participate in the top-level meeting and the foreign ministers' conference, and supported the convening of a peace conference with the participation of all relevant countries.

The note said that the government of the German Democratic Republic is also prepared to participate in the foreign ministers' conference, if the governments of other countries insist on holding such a conference and are not yet prepared to hold a top-level meeting. The German Democratic Republic believes that it is correct to emphasize that the foreign ministers' negotiations must unconditionally discuss the issue of a German peace treaty and the issue of West Berlin. The duration of this conference should be limited to two months to prevent West Germany from continuing to expand its nuclear armament under the guise of long-term negotiations.

In the reply, the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the issue of concluding a German peace treaty can no longer be delayed. Therefore, it will do everything possible to promote the rapid conclusion of the treaty. The conclusion of a German peace treaty will be the most effective contribution to establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe and to disengaging the military forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. The conclusion of the treaty will be the beginning of a peaceful resolution to all issues related to the entire German question. It will be a major step towards mutual understanding and reconciliation between the two Germanies in establishing an all-German confederation, and will pave a shortcut to the unification of the two Germanies.

The reply believes that representatives of the two Germanies must participate in the conference discussing the German peace treaty, a matter of vital importance to the German people.

Regarding the West Berlin issue, the reply states that the government of the German Democratic Republic declares that it is prepared to thoroughly study all constructive proposals regarding ending the occupation status of West Berlin and peacefully resolving the West Berlin issue, as long as these proposals fully respect the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. In order to demonstrate its willingness to reconcile, the German Democratic Republic expresses its agreement to establish a demilitarized free city of West Berlin within its territory. However, it firmly opposes some Western politicians' claims, such as that abolishing the West Berlin occupation system would threaten the security of the United States. The reply points out that European peace is threatened entirely as a result of the current US policy of supporting West German militarism.

    德意志民主共和国复照苏联
    同意开最高级会议和外长会议
    讨论对德和约必须有两个德国代表参加
    新华社柏林26日电　据德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国政府26日将一份对苏联政府3月2日的照会的复照交给苏联政府。
    复照说，德意志民主共和国政府同意苏联政府3月2日的照会中所持的论点和建设性的意见，并支持苏联政府关于召开最高级会议的建议，认为这个会议是当前条件下达成积极协议的最适宜的方法。
    德意志民主共和国希望，在最高级会议上能就某些重要的迫切问题达成协议，其中包括准备召开和会以缔结对德和约和使西柏林局势正常化问题。
    德意志民主共和国政府在复照中表示同意苏联政府所提出的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克应该参加最高级会议和外长会议的建议，并支持召开所有有关国家参加的和平会议。
    照会说，德意志民主共和国政府还准备参加外长会议，如果其他国家的政府坚持举行这样的会议而且还没有准备举行最高级会议的话。德意志民主共和国认为，强调指出外长的谈判必须无条件地讨论对德和约问题和西柏林问题，这是正确的。这个会议的期限应当限定为两个月，以便防止西德在长期谈判的掩饰下继续扩大原子武装。
    德意志民主共和国政府在复照中认为，缔结对德和约的问题不能再拖延了。因此，它将尽一切努力来促成和约的迅速缔结。缔结对德和约对于在欧洲建立无原子武器区、对于使北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约的军事力量脱离接触，将是最有成效的贡献。缔结和约将是和平解决同整个德国问题有联系的一切问题的开端。它将是使两个德国在建立一个全德帮联方面取得互相谅解与和解的重大步骤，并将为两个德国的统一开辟一条捷径。
    复照认为，两个德国的代表必须参加讨论对德和约这样一个德国人民的切身问题的会议。
    复照说，关于西柏林问题，德意志民主共和国政府声明，它准备详尽地研究一切关于结束西柏林占领状态与和平解决西柏林问题的一切建设性建议，只要这些建议充分尊重德意志民主共和国的主权。德意志民主共和国为了证明它准备和解，表示同意在本国境内建立西柏林非军事化自由市。但是，它坚决反对西方政客的一些说法，譬如，说什么取消西柏林占领制度将使美国的安全受到威胁等。复照指出，欧洲和平受到威胁，完全是由于美国目前的那种支持西德军国主义的政策的结果。
