Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The following are six letters exchanged between the Dalai Lama and Tan Guansan, acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet and political commissar of the Tibet Military Region, after the Tibetan traitorous group launched a rebellion on March 10th and before the Dalai Lama was kidnapped from Lhasa on the night of March 17th. The Dalai Lama wrote three of the letters himself.

The rebellion in Lhasa was launched on the day the Dalai Lama was scheduled to attend a performance at the Tibet Military Region Auditorium. The Dalai Lama himself decided to go to the Tibet Military Region Auditorium and scheduled the visit for March 10th. The Tibetan traitorous group, after prior arrangement, spread rumors that the Tibet Military Region troops were going to detain the Dalai Lama, and using this as an excuse, gathered crowds in Lhasa on this day, confined the Dalai Lama to the Norbulingka, and openly launched an armed rebellion. After the incident, General Tan Guansan immediately wrote a short letter to the Dalai Lama on the same day, explaining that due to the rebellion of reactionary elements, he should temporarily not attend the performance. The Dalai Lama wrote a letter to General Tan Guansan on the 11th, saying: "The reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that endanger me. I am trying to quell this."

On March 11th, General Tan Guansan wrote to the Dalai Lama, pointing out that the reactionary elements were openly carrying out military provocations and demanded that the Tibetan local government be responsible for immediately stopping them.

On March 12th, the Dalai Lama replied to General Tan Guansan, again explaining the "serious incidents that create discord between the Central Government and the local government" in the name of protecting his safety by reactionary elements, and expressing that he was "doing everything possible to deal with it."

On March 15th, General Tan Guansan wrote to the Dalai Lama, explaining the Central Government's attitude towards the rebellion and welcoming the Dalai Lama's attitude of trying his best to deal with the incident.

On March 16th, the Dalai Lama wrote to General Tan Guansan, saying that he had educated the officials of the Tibetan local government and expressed that he might go to the military region in a few days. However, the day after the Dalai Lama sent this letter, on the night of March 17th, the traitorous group kidnapped the Dalai Lama from Lhasa to the Loka area in southeastern Lhasa. Then, on the night of March 19th, the traitorous group launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa.

The full text of the six letters is as follows:

(1) Letter from Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, to the Dalai Lama on March 10th

Respected Dalai Lama:

Your willingness to come to the military region is a very good thing, and we express our warm welcome. However, due to the conspiracy and provocation of reactionary elements, you are facing great difficulties, so you can temporarily not come.

With respectful greetings and wishing you good health.

Tan Guansan, March 10, 1959

(2) Letter from the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, on March 11th

Dear Comrade Political Commissar Tan:

Yesterday, I decided to go to the military region to see a play, but due to the incitement of a few bad people, the monks and laypeople, not understanding the truth, followed them and obstructed me, making it impossible to visit. I am ashamed, worried, and at a loss. When the letter you sent (Note: This refers to the letter from General Tan Guansan to the Dalai Lama on the 10th) appeared before my eyes, I immediately felt infinite excitement.

The reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that endanger me. I am trying to quell this. When the situation stabilizes in a few days, I will definitely meet with you. If you have any internal instructions for me, please frankly inform me through this person (referring to Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme).

Dalai Lama, personally presented

(3) Letter from Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, to the Dalai Lama on March 11th

Dalai Lama:

Now the reactionary elements dare to be unscrupulous and openly and arrogantly carry out military provocations. They have built fortifications along the national defense highway (the highway north of the Norbulingka) and deployed a large number of machine guns and armed reactionary elements, which has seriously damaged national defense traffic safety.

In the past, we have repeatedly talked to the Kashag about this. The People's Liberation Army has the responsibility to defend national defense and the safety of national defense traffic. It is difficult to ignore such serious military provocations. Therefore, the Tibet Military Region has sent letters to Sokhang, Luksang Tsering, Xiasu, Palha, etc., asking them to inform the reactionary elements to immediately dismantle all fortifications and withdraw from the highway. Otherwise, they will be fully responsible for the bad consequences caused by this. This is a special report. Please let me know your opinions as soon as possible.

With respectful greetings and wishing you good health.

Tan Guansan, March 11, 1959

(4) Letter from the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, on March 12th

Dear Comrade Political Commissar Tan:

I think you have received the letter sent through Ngapoi yesterday (i.e., March 11th). I received the letter you sent this morning. The illegal behavior of the reactionary group makes me infinitely sad. Yesterday, I notified the Kashag and ordered the illegal People's Assembly to be dissolved immediately, and the reactionary elements who arrogantly entered the Norbulingka in the name of protecting me must withdraw immediately. Regarding the serious incidents that occurred yesterday and the day before yesterday that created discord between the Central Government and the local government in the name of protecting my safety, I am doing everything possible to deal with it. This morning at 8:30 Beijing time, a few Tibetan troops suddenly fired a few shots near the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Fortunately, there was no major riot. Regarding the questions raised in your letter (Note: This refers to the letter from General Tan Guansan to the Dalai Lama on the 11th), I am now planning to educate and instruct my subordinates.

Please frankly inform me of your instructions and opinions.

Dalai, presented on the 12th

(5) Letter from Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, to the Dalai Lama on March 15th

Respected Dalai Lama:

I have received your two letters of the 11th and 12th. The traitorous activities carried out by some upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet have developed to an intolerable point. These people have colluded with foreigners to carry out reactionary and traitorous activities for a long time. The Central Government has always been magnanimous in the past and ordered the Tibetan local government to seriously deal with this, but the Tibetan local government has always adopted an attitude of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing, and has actually helped their activities, so that it has developed into such a serious situation. Now the Central Government still hopes that the Tibetan local government will change its erroneous attitude, immediately take responsibility, quell the rebellion, and severely punish the traitorous elements. Otherwise, the Central Government will have to come forward to safeguard the unity and unification of the motherland.

You said in your letter, "Regarding the serious incidents that occurred yesterday and the day before yesterday that created discord between the Central Government and the local government in the name of protecting my safety, I am doing everything possible to deal with it." We very much welcome your correct attitude.

We are very concerned about your current situation and safety. If you think it is necessary to get rid of the dangerous situation of being kidnapped by traitorous elements and if it is possible, we warmly welcome you and your entourage to stay in the military region for a short period of time. We are willing to take full responsibility for your safety. How to deal with it is entirely up to you.

In addition, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress has decided to be held on April 17th. I hereby inform you.

With respectful greetings and wishing you good health.

Tan Guansan, March 15, 1959

(6) Letter from the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, on March 16th

Dear Comrade Political Commissar Tan:

I received your letter of the 15th just now at three o'clock. I am very happy that you are so concerned about my safety, thank you.

The day before yesterday, on the 5th day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (March 14th in the Gregorian calendar), I spoke to more than 70 representatives of government officials, etc., and conducted education from various aspects, asking everyone to seriously consider the current and long-term interests, and stabilize the situation, otherwise my life will definitely be difficult to protect. After such severe accusations, the situation has improved slightly. Although the internal and external situation here is still very difficult to deal with, I am using clever methods to internally divide the government officials into two types of people: those who are progressive and those who oppose the revolution. Once there is a certain amount of trustworthy strength in a few days, I will take a secret approach to the military region. At that time, I will send you a letter first. Please also take reliable measures. If you have any opinions, please write to me frequently.

Dalai, presented on the 16th

    西藏叛国集团发动叛乱到达赖喇嘛被劫出拉萨以前
    达赖喇嘛和谭冠三将军的来往信件
    新华社29日讯　下面发表的是在3月10日西藏叛国集团发动叛乱以后，到3月17日夜间达赖喇嘛被劫出拉萨以前，达赖喇嘛和中央驻西藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军的六封来往信件。达赖喇嘛的三封信都是他亲笔写的。
    拉萨的叛乱是在达赖喇嘛预定前往西藏军区礼堂看戏的那一天发动的。要到西藏军区礼堂看戏，并定在3月10日去看，都是达赖喇嘛自己决定的。西藏叛国集团经过事前布置，就放出西藏军区部队要扣留达赖喇嘛的谣言，并且以此为借口，在这一天在拉萨市区聚众把达赖喇嘛困在罗布林卡，并且公开实行武装叛乱。事件发生后，谭冠三将军即在当天写了一封短信给达赖喇嘛，说明由于反动分子的叛乱，请他暂时不要来看戏。达赖喇嘛在11日写信给谭冠三将军，信中说：“反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。对此我正设法平息。”
    3月11日，谭冠三将军写信给达赖喇嘛，指出反动分子公开进行军事挑衅，要求西藏地方政府负责立即予以制止。
    3月12日，达赖喇嘛复信给谭冠三将军，再次说明反动分子以保护他的安全为名而“制造的严重离间中央与地方关系的事件”，并表示他“正尽一切可能设法处理。”
    3月15日，谭冠三将军写信给达赖喇嘛，说明中央对此次叛乱事件的态度，并欢迎达赖喇嘛正尽可能设法处理此次事件的态度。
    3月16日，达赖喇嘛写信给谭冠三将军，说他已经向西藏地方政府官员进行了教育，并表示几天之后可能到军区去。但是就在达赖喇嘛发出这封信的第二天，3月17日夜间，叛国集团就将达赖喇嘛劫出拉萨，到拉萨东南的山南地区去。然后，在3月19日夜，叛国集团就发动了对人民解放军驻拉萨部队的全面进攻。
    这六封信的全文如下：
      （一）3月10日中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军致达赖喇嘛的信敬爱的达赖喇嘛：
    您表示愿意来军区，这是一件很好的事，我们表示热烈的欢迎。但是由于反动分子的阴谋挑拨给您造成很大的困难，故可暂时不来。
        此致
    敬礼并祝保重
                                      谭冠三　1959年3月10日
    （二）3月11日达赖喇嘛致中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军的信亲爱的谭政委同志：
    昨天我决定去军区看戏，但由于少数坏人的煽动，而僧俗人民不解真象追随其后，进行阻拦，确实无法去访，使我害羞难言，忧虑交加，而处于莫知所措的境地。您毫不计较，送来的信（按：这是指谭冠三将军10日致达赖喇嘛的信）出现在我眼前时，顿时感到无限的兴奋。
    反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。对此我正设法平息。几天以后，情况安定了，一定同您见面。您对我有何内部的指示，请通过此人（按指阿沛·阿旺晋美）坦率示知。
                                          达赖喇嘛亲笔呈
      （三）3月11日中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军致达赖喇嘛的信达赖喇嘛：
    现在反动分子竟敢肆无忌惮，公开地狂妄地进行军事挑衅，在国防公路沿线（罗布林卡北面的公路）修了工事，布置了大量机枪和武装反动分子，已经十分严重的破坏了国防交通安全。
    过去我们曾多次向噶厦谈过，人民解放军负有保卫国防，保卫国防交通安全的责任，对于这种严重的军事挑衅行为，实难置之不理。因此，西藏军区已去信通知索康、柳霞、夏苏、帕拉等，请他们通知反动分子，立即拆除一切工事，并撤离公路。否则由此引起恶果，完全由他们自己负责。特此报告，您有何意见，亦请尽快告知。
        此致
    敬礼并祝保重
                                      谭冠三　1959年3月11日
    （四）3月12日达赖喇嘛致中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军的信亲爱的谭政委同志：
    昨天（按即3月11日）经阿沛转去一信，想已收到了。今早您送来的信收到了。反动集团的违法行为，使我无限忧伤。昨天我通知噶厦，责令非法的人民会议必须立即解散，以保卫我为名而狂妄地进驻罗布林卡的反动分子必须立即撤走。对于昨天、前天发生的、以保护我的安全为名而制造的严重离间中央与地方关系的事件，我正尽一切可能设法处理。今天早晨北京时间八点半钟，有少数藏军突然在青藏公路附近鸣了几枪，幸好没有发生大的骚乱。关于您来信（按：这是指谭冠三将军11日致达赖喇嘛的信）中提的问题，我现在正打算向下属的几个人进行教育和嘱托。
    您对我有何指示的意见，请知心坦率的示知。
                                            达　赖　12日呈
      （五）3月15日中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军致达赖喇嘛的信敬爱的达赖喇嘛：
    您11日、12日两信均敬悉。西藏一部分上层反动分子所进行的叛国活动，已经发展到不能容忍的地步。这些人勾结外国人，进行反动叛国的活动，为时已久。中央过去一向宽大为怀，责成西藏地方政府认真处理，而西藏地方政府则一贯采取阳奉阴违的态度，实际上帮助了他们的活动，以致发展到现在这样严重的局面。现在中央仍然希望西藏地方政府改变错误态度，立即负起责任，平息叛乱，严惩叛国分子。否则，中央只有自己出面来维护祖国的团结和统一。
    您来信中说，对于“以保护我的安全为名而制造的严重离间中央与地方关系的事件，我正尽一切可能设法处理”。对于您的这种正确态度，我们甚为欢迎。
    对于您现在的处境和安全，我们甚为关怀。如果您认为需要脱离现在被叛国分子劫持的危险境地，而且又有可能的话，我们热忱地欢迎您和您的随行人员到军区来住一个短期，我们愿对您的安全负完全的责任。究竟如何措置为好，完全听从您的决定。
    另外，第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已决定于4月17日举行。特此告诉您。
          此致
    敬礼并祝保重
                                      谭冠三　1959年3月15日
      （六）3月16日达赖喇嘛致中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军的信亲爱的谭政委同志：
    你15日的来信，方才三点钟收到。您对我的安全甚为关怀，使我甚感愉快，谢谢。
    前天藏历2月5日（公历3月14日）我向政府官员等的代表七十余人讲话，从各方面进行了教育，要大家认真考虑目前和长远的利害关系，安定下来，否则我的生命一定难保。这样严厉地指责之后，情况稍微好了一些。现在此间内外的情况虽然仍很难处置，但我正在用巧妙的办法，在政府官员中从内部划分进步与反对革命的两种人的界线。一旦几天之后，有了一定数量的足以信赖的力量之后，将采取秘密的方式前往军区，届时先给您去信，对此请您亦采取可靠的措施。您有何意见，请经常来信。
                                              达赖　16日呈
