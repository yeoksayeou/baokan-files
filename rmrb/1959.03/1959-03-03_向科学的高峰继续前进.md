    Continue to Advance Towards the Peak of Science
    Ren Hui
    Editor's Note: This article, published in the fifth issue of "Red Flag" magazine, raises the question of how to correctly approach scientific research. We hope everyone will pay attention to it.
    In the past year, in the struggle to criticize bourgeois academic thought, many academic works, teaching syllabi, and academic papers have emerged. The authors of these works include not only professors and experts, but also young lecturers, teaching assistants, young researchers, and students. They have also made many valuable contributions in the fields of natural science and technology. Undoubtedly, in evaluating these achievements, we must see the labor of both young people and experienced experts, the labor of both students and teachers. We should not only see one aspect while negating the other. However, in any case, the fact that young people, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of some experienced teachers and experts, have followed the correct direction, utilized collective strength, and achieved good results is a new phenomenon. This is one of the many new things that emerged during the comprehensive and nationwide Great Leap Forward in our country last year, and it deserves special welcome and attention.
    The achievements of these young people show that science is not so mysterious and unpredictable. As long as we adhere to the correct direction, dare to think and act, and work hard, we can break through the heavy fog imposed on science by bourgeois scholars and achieve certain results. In the social sciences, people strive to apply Marxist theory in their research. Even if they lack experience and knowledge for the time being, they are more likely to approach and reach the truth compared to those bourgeois scholars who are limited to some erroneous viewpoints. The achievements of these young people have greatly enhanced their courage and confidence to continue advancing in scientific work, and have also provided very important inspiration to many experienced teachers and experts on the direction and methods of scientific research.
    Young people who have already achieved preliminary results should, and certainly can, continuously improve on the basis of their existing achievements and continuously progress. We must continue to exert our utmost effort and continue to break down the superstition of false authority. Similarly, we must never be satisfied with the little achievements we have already made, and we must not become arrogant because of these achievements, or regard scientific research as an easy task, thinking that there is no need for further arduous study and effort, or that we no longer need the help of experienced teachers and experts.
    Scientific research is an extremely complex and arduous undertaking, requiring us to pay long-term hard work. This is because the task of science is to explore the objective laws of nature and society, and objective laws are not easily discovered. In order to obtain new scientific results, it is necessary to collect abundant materials and conduct research with the effort of "discarding the crude and selecting the refined, discarding the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the superficial to the essential." This, of course, cannot be achieved by short-term crash efforts. The reason why some young people have been able to write some books and articles in a short period of time, in addition to other reasons, is also because they have studied for several years in the past and accumulated considerable knowledge. It is unrealistic to seek immediate results or instant success in science. Engels once said, "Even the application of the materialist viewpoint to a single historical event requires years of quiet study, since it is obvious that empty talk is of no use here, and such a task can only be solved by relying on a large amount of historical material that has been critically examined and fully understood." (Engels: On Karl Marx's book "Critique of Political Economy")
    Moreover, it should be admitted that the achievements already made are, after all, "the first step in a long march." Take the criticism of bourgeois academic thought, for example. What has already been done is only the first round of this ideological struggle. Because the direction is basically correct, this first round of struggle can hit the pain points of bourgeois academic thought in many aspects. However, many critical articles are still relatively crude, and sometimes they inevitably contain some simplistic and one-sided shortcomings that need to be overcome. Following the correct direction and continuing to lead the battle into depth requires more in-depth study of complex objects, more detailed analysis of the content of bourgeois academic thought, a comprehensive unfolding of the work of "destruction" and "construction," and the exploration of areas that predecessors have not reached in some issues. Therefore, the difficulties encountered and the time and energy required in future work will inevitably be much greater than what has already been paid.
    Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty once used the analogy of traveling in mountain caves in one of his articles to illustrate the principle that learning becomes more difficult as it goes deeper. He said: "The deeper you enter, the more difficult it is to advance, and the more wonderful you see. ... Those who are easy and near attract many travelers; those who are dangerous and far attract few who reach them. But the world's wonderful, magnificent, strange, and extraordinary sights always lie in the dangerous and distant." He said that only those with ambition and diligence can reach such a realm. (Wang Anshi: Record of Traveling in Baochan Mountain) Are we warriors who are determined to delve into the "dangerous and distant" and seek out the "wonderful, magnificent, strange, and extraordinary sights"? Then we must use tenacious and diligent study to step by step climb to the peak of science, no matter what difficulties and dangers lie on the road!
    We must learn from practice, learn from the masses, and also learn from all the knowledge that mankind has created and accumulated. Knowledge is inherited. Any achievement in science does not fall from the sky. In order to surpass our predecessors, we must inherit and develop the knowledge that our predecessors have accumulated. Marxist production is the most profound and thorough revolution in science. However, as Lenin said in "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues," Marxism is "a model of communism emerging from all human knowledge." Marx "relied on a full understanding of all the knowledge provided by previous science" to prove the conclusion that capitalism is bound to perish and communism is bound to win. Engels said in "Speech at the Grave of Marx": "Science, in Marx's view, is a revolutionary force that plays a driving role in history." Marx has always linked the achievements of scientific research with the interests of the revolution.
    In order to inherit the cultural and scientific heritage of our predecessors, in addition to independently conducting research on literature, we must also learn from all the experienced teachers and experts who are willing to help us and are willing to serve the socialist cause. There are undoubtedly many such experienced teachers and experts, especially after ten years of proletarian unity, education, and transformation. Is it also possible to learn from experts who hold bourgeois academic views? As long as these experts are indeed specialized in their fields, it is also possible to learn from them. Of course, we do not learn their bourgeois views, but learn the useful knowledge they have mastered, and learn the valuable heritage accumulated from the past. Generally speaking, learning from experienced teachers and experts is an indispensable aspect of developing China's science and culture. Moreover, many of them are now striving to get rid of the various old and erroneous viewpoints that are binding them and are gradually advancing. The achievements of academic criticism and research work in the past year certainly include a portion of their efforts. In the future achievements on the same front, there will still be their contributions. Young people should work with them, actively help them continue to progress, and continue to learn from them with an open mind.
    Young people should adhere to the correct direction of Marxism-Leninism, which combines theory and practice. They must dare and be good at thoroughly criticizing and negating the erroneous academic views of the bourgeoisie and discarding those boring and cumbersome mazes. They must also dare and be good at learning all the scientific truths and useful knowledge materials left by their predecessors to enrich and improve themselves, so that they can make better contributions to the motherland and the people. This attitude is what Lu Xun called "take-ism." Lu Xun once compared the cultural heritage of China and foreign countries to a large house. He believed that those who hesitated in front of the door of the house and dared not enter, and those who wanted to set a fire to burn it down, were both wrong. He advocated "taking it." He pointed out that the key lies in "the master is the new master, and the house will also become a new house. But first, this person must be calm, brave, discerning, and selfless. (Qiejieting Essays) Today's Chinese youth, under the teachings of the Party, should act as such a "new master."
    Under the leadership of the Party, let us continue to march towards the peak of science in great strides! We must plant the red flag on the summit and not be satisfied with just walking up the hillside!

### 向科学的高峰继续前进

    向科学的高峰继续前进
    任会
    编者按：“红旗”杂志第五期刊载的这篇文章，提出了如何正确对待科学研究工作的问题，希望大家注意。
    近一年来，在批判资产阶级学术思想的斗争中，出现了不少学术著作、教学大纲和学术论文。这些作品的作者中，不但有教授和专家，而且有青年讲师、助教，青年研究人员和学生。他们在自然科学技术方面，也作出了许多有价值的贡献。毫无疑问，在估价这些成就的时候，必须同时看到青年和老专家的劳动，同时看到学生和教师的劳动，不应当只看到一个侧面而抹煞另一个侧面。但是无论如何，青年们在党的领导下，也在一部分老教师、老专家们的帮助下，遵循正确的方向，运用集体的力量，获得了良好的成绩，这却是一种新事物。这是去年我国全面全民大跃进中出现的许多新事物中的一个，值得特别的欢迎和重视。
    这些青年的成绩表明，科学并不是那么神秘莫测的。只要坚持正确的方向，敢想敢作，刻苦努力，就可以冲破资产阶级学者所加在科学上的重重迷雾，取得一定的成果。在社会科学方面，人们在研究中努力运用马克思主义理论，即使一时经验不足，知识不多，比起那些局限在一些错误观点中的资产阶级学者来，却更易于接近和达到真理。青年人的这些成绩大大增强了他们在科学工作上继续前进的勇气和信心，也使得许多老教师、老专家在科学研究的方向和方法问题上得到了很重要的启发。
    已经取得初步成果的青年还应当，而且一定能够，在现有的成绩的基础上不断提高。不断进步。我们一定要继续鼓足干劲，继续破除对于假权威的迷信。同样，我们也决不能满足于已有的一点成绩，不能因为有了这些成绩就骄傲起来，就把科学研究看成轻而易举的事情，以为不必再作艰苦的学习和努力，或者不再需要老教师、老专家的帮助。
    科学研究是极其复杂、艰苦的事业，需要我们付出长期的辛勤的劳动。这是因为，科学的任务在于探求自然和社会的客观规律，而客观规律不是轻易可以发现的。为了获得新的科学成果必须收集丰富的材料，进行“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的研究功夫，这自然不是短期突击所能奏效的。一些青年们之所以能够在短时间里写出一些书和文章，除了其他的原因外，也是因为在过去学习了几年，积累了相当的知识的缘故。在科学上企求立竿见影、朝发夕至是不实际的。恩格斯曾经说过，“即令只要在一个单独的历史实例上发挥唯物主义观点，也是一种需要多年静心研究的科学工作，因为很明显，在这里讲空话是无济于事的，这样的任务只有依靠大量的、经过批判审查了的、完全领会了的历史材料才可解决。”（恩格斯：论卡尔·马克思著“政治经济学批判”一书）
    而且应当承认，已有的成绩毕竟还是
  “万里长征的第一步”。拿对资产阶级学术思想的批判来说吧，已经做了的，还只是这种思想斗争中的第一个回合。因为方向基本上正确，所以在这第一回合的斗争中，就能在不少方面打中资产阶级学术思想的痛处。但是不少的批判文章还比较粗糙，有时也难免包含着一些需要克服的简单化和片面性的缺点。循着正确的方向，把战斗继续引向纵深发展，那就要更深入地研究复杂的对象，更细致地分析资产阶级学术思想的内容，就要全面地展开“破”和“立”的工作，并且在有些问题上还要开拓前人所没有达到的领域。因此，在今后的工作中所遇到的困难，所要付出的时间和精力，必然要比已经付出的大得多。
    宋朝的王安石在他的一篇文章中，曾以游山洞作比喻，说明学问愈深入愈艰难的道理。他说：“入之愈深，其进愈难，而其见愈奇。……夫夷以近，则游者众；险以远，则至者少。而世之奇伟瑰怪非常之观，常在于险远。”他说，只有有志气、不怠惰的人才可能达到这样的境界。
  （王安石：游褒禅山记）我们是有志于深入“险远”，探寻那“奇伟瑰怪非常之观”的勇士么，我们就一定要用顽强的、勤奋的学习来一步步走上科学的高峰，不管这路上还有什么困难和危险！
    我们要向实践学习，要向群众学习，也要向人类已经创造和积累起来的全部知识学习。知识是有继承性的，科学上的任何一个成就，都不是从空中掉下来的；为了超过前人，就要继承和发展前人已经积累起来的知识。马克思主义的生产是科学中的最深刻最彻底的革命，然而，正如列宁在“青年团的任务”中所说的，马克思主义是“共产主义从全部人类知识中产生出来的典范”，马克思
  “借助于充分领会以往的科学所提供的全部知识”，证实了资本主义必然灭亡、共产主义必然胜利的结论。恩格斯在“马克思墓前演说”中说：“科学在马克思看来是一种在历史上起推动作用的、革命的力量。”马克思从来是把科学研究的成果和革命的利益联系在一起的。
    要继承前人的文化科学遗产，除了独立地进行文献的研究以外，也要向一切愿意帮助我们的、愿意为社会主义事业服务的老教师和老专家学习，而这样的老教师、老专家无疑是不少的，尤其是在经过了无产阶级的十年来的团结、教育、改造之后。对于抱着资产阶级学术观点的专家，是不是也可以学习呢？只要这些专家确是学有专长，就也可以向他们学习。当然不是学习他们的资产阶级观点，而是学习他们所掌握的有用的知识，学习他们所掌握的由过去时代积累下来的有价值的遗产。一般说来，向老教师、老专家学习，对于发展我国的科学和文化，是不可缺少的一个方面。何况现在他们中不少人正在努力摆脱束缚着他们的各种旧的错误观点而逐步前进。过去一年中的学术批判和研究工作的成绩，固然有他们的一分力量在内；在今后的同一战线上的成绩，也仍将有他们的贡献。青年完全应当同他们一起工作，积极地帮助他们继续进步，同时继续虚心地向他们学习。
    青年应当坚持马克思列宁主义的、理论和实践相结合的正确的方向，既要敢于和善于彻底批判和否定资产阶级的错误的学术观点，抛开那些无聊的、繁琐的迷魂阵，也要敢于和善于学习前人留下的一切科学真理和有用的知识材料，用来丰富和提高自己，以便使自己能为祖国和人民作出更好的贡献。这种态度，也就是鲁迅所说的“拿来主义”。鲁迅曾把中外的文化遗产比作一座大宅子，他认为那种在大宅子门前徘徊不敢进去和想放一把火烧掉的人都是不对的。他主张“拿来”。他指出，关键在于“主人是新主人，宅子也就会成为新宅子。然而首先要这人沉着、勇猛，有辨别，不自私。（且介亭杂文）在党教导下的今天的中国青年，应当充当这样的“新主人”。
    让我们在党的领导下，继续大踏步地向科学的高峰进军！我们一定要把红旗插上峰顶，而不以走上山坡为满足！
