Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Rio de Janeiro News: General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, Prestes, published an article in the inaugural issue of the "New Direction" weekly on the 27th, opposing the Robore Oil Agreement, which could allow American oil trusts to take advantage of the situation to enter.

The Robore Oil Agreement was signed between Brazil and Bolivia in March of last year. According to this agreement, Bolivia leased the oil exploitation rights in the Santa Cruz region to Brazilian private oil companies. However, because the Brazilian National Bank was unable to finance these companies, and the agreement allowed foreign capital to exploit oil in the above-mentioned areas through these companies, it opened the door for American oil trusts to meddle in Bolivian oil.

In the article, Prestes pointed out that the common enemy of the Latin American people is US imperialism, and this agreement is an attempt to create divisions among the Latin American people, undermining the authority of Brazil's demand for self-determination in order to protect its own oil.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Havana News: Chilean Senator and Socialist Party leader Salvador Allende, who is currently visiting here, called on Latin American countries on the 27th to take unified action, based on the experience of Asian and African countries, to obtain their "complete economic independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago News: The Chilean Socialist Party recently issued a statement condemning the Organization of American States, controlled by the United States, as "being systematically used as a tool for dictatorial regimes and foreign monopolies."

The statement emphasized that, up to now, the Organization of American States has only played the role of concealing various illegal interests, which is contrary to the interests of Latin America. The statement said that this organization is being used to "undermine the national freedom and independence" of Latin American countries and obstruct "the recovery of their national resources."

The statement expressed the Chilean Socialist Party's confidence in the future of Latin America. These countries have the power to break free from the shackles of imperialism and develop abundant wealth for the benefit of the people.

    拉丁美洲人民要求经济独立
    巴共总书记反对美国染指巴西石油
    智利社会党号召摆脱帝国主义枷锁
    据新华社1日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯在27日的“新方针”周刊创刊号上发表文章，反对能使美国石油托辣斯乘机而入的罗波雷石油协定。
    罗波雷石油协定是巴西和玻利维亚在去年3月间签订的。根据这项协定，玻利维亚把圣克卢斯地区的石油开采权租让给巴西私营石油公司。但是，由于巴西国家银行无力资助这些公司，而且这项协定又允许外国资本通过这些公司来开采上述地区的石油，因而为美国石油托辣斯染指玻利维亚的石油打开了方便之门。
    普列斯特斯在文章中指出，拉丁美洲人民的共同敌人是美帝国主义，而这个协定是想在拉丁美洲人民中间挑起分歧，使巴西为了保护自己的石油而要求的自决权威信扫地。
    新华社1日讯　哈瓦那消息：目前正在这里进行访问的智利参议员和社会党领袖萨尔瓦多·阿伦德在上月27日曾呼吁拉丁美洲国家采取一致行动，根据亚非国家的经验，来获得自己的“完全的经济独立”。
    据新华社讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利社会党最近发表声明，谴责美国控制下的美洲国家组织“被有计划地用来作为独裁政权和外国垄断资本的工具”。
    声明强调指出，到目前为止，美洲国家组织只起了隐蔽各种非法利益的作用，而这是违反拉丁美洲的利益的。声明说，这个组织正在被用来对拉丁美洲国家的“民族自由和独立进行破坏”和阻挠“收回本国的资源”。
    声明表示智利社会党对拉丁美洲的前途充满信心。这些国家有力摆脱帝国主义的枷锁以及为人民的利益开发大量财富。
