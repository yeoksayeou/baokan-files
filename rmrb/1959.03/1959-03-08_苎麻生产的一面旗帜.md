A Banner of Ramie Production
　　Fang Di

Yangxin County, Hubei, a famous ramie producing area, shone brightly in ramie production in 1958 despite the attack of severe natural disasters, creating a glorious achievement of a great harvest despite great disasters. The county's total ramie output and average yield per unit area last year increased by more than 40% compared with the bumper year of 1957. At the same time, many examples of large-area high-yield and high-yield production emerged. For example, the 6,800-plus mu of ramie in the Zenggang, Xingfu, and Xiahai brigades of the Jinhai People's Commune achieved an average yield of 302 jin per mu, of which more than 400 mu achieved an average yield of 500 to 600 jin per mu, and 47 mu achieved an average yield of 1,000 to 1,500 jin per mu. There were even more such examples of high-yield production throughout the county.

Yangxin County is one of the nationally famous ramie producing areas with several hundred years of ramie cultivation history. In 1958, its ramie planting area accounted for more than 25% of the total area of similar crops in Hubei Province, and its output was also the highest in the province. It has good conditions for developing ramie production: the masses have relatively rich experience in growing ramie, the natural conditions are relatively suitable, there are many sources of fertilizer, and the windbreak conditions are good. Therefore, the Party and government leading departments here, in accordance with the production policy of comprehensive development with grain and cotton as the main focus, vigorously developed ramie production according to local conditions. Compared with 1955, the county's ramie planting area has increased by about two and a half times, and both the total output and average yield per mu have increased significantly. In 1958, although the county suffered from severe natural disasters unseen in a century, with a drought lasting more than eighty days, which generally reduced the yield of second-crop ramie, the bumper harvest of first-crop ramie and the relatively good harvest of third-crop ramie resulted in a much higher total ramie output and average yield per mu than in 1957.

The fundamental key to the unprecedented bumper harvest of ramie in Yangxin County in 1958 was that the Party committees at all levels, under the premise of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, led the masses to implement comprehensive technical reforms in ramie production and waged a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters. From the crop preparation stage to the rush harvesting stage, people have been continuously carrying out technical reforms, such as changing from less fertilizer to more fertilizer, changing from shallow hoeing to deep hoeing, changing from using local soil to build up the roots to borrowing "guest soil" to build up the roots, as well as reforming ditches and reforming production tools. These are important technical measures for increasing ramie production. In terms of disaster resistance, drought, pests, and wind damage were overcome. In the fight against drought, the entire county was almost fully committed for a long time. In carrying out all these tasks, the leaders of Party committees at all levels took the lead in demonstrating and using their own actions to influence the broad masses. If the bumper harvest of first-crop ramie in the county this year was mainly due to the significant role played by technical reforms, then the important factor for the increased production of third-crop ramie was the persistence in the struggle against disasters.

    苎麻生产的一面旗帜
    方堤
    著名苎麻产区湖北阳新的苎麻生产，1958年在特大自然灾害的袭击下仍然大放异彩，创造出大灾大丰收的光辉成绩。这个县去年苎麻的总产量和平均单位产量，都比丰收的1957年增产四成以上。同时，还出现了许多大面积丰产和高额丰产的典型，像金海人民公社的曾港、幸福、下海三个大队的六千八百多亩苎麻，平均亩产量达到了三百零二斤，其中平均亩产五百斤到六百斤以上的有四百多亩；平均亩产一千斤到一千五百斤以上的有四十七亩。在全县来说，这样的高额丰产典型就更多了。
    阳新县是一个有几百年种苎麻历史的全国著名的苎麻产区之一。1958年，它的苎麻种植面积占湖北省同类作物总面积的25％强，产量也是全省最高的。这里有着发展苎麻生产的良好条件：群众种苎麻的经验比较丰富，自然条件比较适合，肥源较多，防风条件较好等。因此，这里的党、政领导部门，根据以粮、棉为主全面发展的生产方针，因地制宜地大力发展了苎麻生产。和1955年相比，全县苎麻种植面积已增大了约两倍半，无论是总产量和平均亩产量都有显著的提高。1958年，虽然全县遭到了百年未有的严重自然灾害的袭击，整整干旱了八十多天，使二麻普遍减产，但由于头麻特大丰收，三麻的收成也较常年好，结果全县苎麻的总产量和平均亩产量仍比1957年高很多。
    1958年阳新县苎麻空前大丰收的根本关键，是各级党委在全面规划、统筹安排的前提下，领导群众对苎麻生产实行了综合性的技术改革，并向各种自然灾害展开了顽强的斗争。从作物的培育准备阶段起直到抢收抢打阶段止，人们都连续不断地进行着技术改革，如：改少施肥为多施肥，改浅锄为深锄，改用本土壅蔸为借“客土”壅蔸，以及改革沟厢和改革生产工具等。这些都是苎麻增产的重要技术措施。在抗灾方面，战胜了旱、病虫害和风的为害。在抗旱中，全县有很长一段时间几乎是全力以赴。在进行所有这些工作时，各级党委的领导人都亲自带头示范，用自己的行动去影响广大群众。如果说，这年全县头麻获得了特大丰收主要是技术改革发挥了重大作用的话，那末三麻增产的重要因素就是坚持了抗灾的斗争。
