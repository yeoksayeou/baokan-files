Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 19th: Kim Cheon-hae, Chairman of the Presidium of the Korean Fatherland Front, stated today regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan that the desire of Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland has not yet been realized. This is the result of the Japanese authorities wanting to "confirm" the already expressed will of Korean residents in Japan to return and to "screen" them, thereby creating new artificial obstacles. This practice by the Japanese authorities is unfounded, and it is extremely inappropriate for the Japanese authorities to delay the return of Korean residents in Japan for even one day based on this "reason."

Kim Cheon-hae said that currently, Korean residents in Japan are ready to depart, and the government of the Republic has made all preparations to welcome them. Under these circumstances, only the Japanese authorities need to take concrete measures to allow them to return. He said that if the Japanese authorities are genuinely willing to justly resolve the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, they should abandon their inappropriate stance of so-called "confirmation" and "screening" of Korean residents in Japan as soon as possible, and abandon their attempts to use the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning home as a political bargaining chip with the Syngman Rhee clique.

Korean writer Lee Ki-young also issued a statement on the 18th, saying that overseas citizens have the sacred and inviolable right to return to their own country. The so-called "screening" is an unreasonable practice. This is a national insult to the Korean residents in Japan who wish to return to their homeland; it is also a brutal trampling of humanitarian principles and human rights.

    谴责日当局阻挠朝侨返国
    新华社平壤19日电　朝鲜祖国战线议长团议长金天海今天就旅日朝侨归国问题发表谈话说，旅日朝鲜侨民的归国愿望至今还没有能够实现。这是由于日本当局要对旅日朝鲜侨民早已表明了的归国意志进行“确认”和对他们进行“甄别”，从而造成了新的人为的障碍的结果。日本当局的这种作法是没有任何根据的，日本当局以这种“理由”使旅日朝侨的归国拖延一天也是极其不当的。
    金天海说，目前，旅日朝侨已经整装待发，共和国政府也作好一切迎接他们的准备，在这种情况下，就只剩下日本当局采取让他们回国的具体措施了。他说，如果日本当局真心愿意公正地解决旅日朝侨的归国问题，就应该尽早地放弃对旅日朝侨进行所谓“确认”和“甄别”的不当立场，并且放弃利用旅日朝侨回国问题作为同李承晚集团在政治方面进行讨价还价的企图。
    朝鲜著名作家李箕永在18日也就此发表谈话说：海外公民要回到自己的祖国是神圣不可侵犯的权利。进行所谓“瓯别”是毫无道理的作法。这是对希望回到自己的祖国的旅日朝侨的民族侮辱；也是粗暴蹂躏人道主义原则和人权的行为。
