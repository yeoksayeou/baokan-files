Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 22nd: Since the beginning of the new semester, students at Shandong Institute of Technology, under the slogan "Study Well and Labor Well," are enthusiastically participating in both learning and labor.

    First, students in all classes are highly motivated to study political theory. In addition to diligently studying the one day a week of political class, they also use their spare time to study political theory on their own initiative.

    Students throughout the institute have further strengthened their study of professional courses, and a spirit of diligent study has begun to take shape in all classes. Many classes in the Department of Metalworking have put forward the "Three Highs" slogan: be highly focused during lectures, be highly efficient during review, and complete assignments with high quality. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the teachers of the institute are also working with the students, taking various measures to improve the quality of teaching. The study group of the second-year students in the power plant major conducts a summary after the teacher finishes a chapter, and uses blackboard newspapers and big-character posters to help with the review. Under the leadership of the Party branch and the guidance of teachers, the second-year students in the electrical machinery and appliances major organized collective discussions, helping many students improve their learning efficiency. The study of basic theory courses has been further emphasized in all classes. Since the beginning of this semester, the teaching of basic theory has been greatly strengthened. In addition to maintaining the necessary systematicness, the content of the textbooks also strives to combine theory with practice and with production. Teachers of chemistry, physics, and other courses have made many attempts in these areas.

    Scientific research activities have also been launched in many classes. A characteristic of class-level scientific research activities this semester is that they are combined with majors, teaching, and production. Based on summarizing existing experience, the second-year students in the pressure processing and machinery major have formulated a scientific research and production plan centered on the research and manufacture of bearings. They are now reorganizing and supplementing the equipment of the original bearing factory and the relevant equipment of the pressure processing workshop in order to put them into scientific research and production.

    The students' productive labor in this institute is being actively carried out in conjunction with teaching this new semester. The internal combustion water pump, jointly researched by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Power Machinery, has been designed and is now being put into trial production. The 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine is being rushed to production by the institute's machine tool factory. Many of the first-year students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering who are participating in the production were originally workers of Grade 4 or above. The first-year students in the electrical machinery and appliances major who are participating in productive labor in the Department of Electrical Engineering Appliance Factory are producing current transformers, voltage transformers, and oil-poor circuit breakers required for 6,000-kilowatt power generation equipment. In the electronic instrument factory, the first-year students in the radio technology major are manufacturing a batch of equipment for the radio basic laboratory of this major, such as universal power supplies, regulated power supplies, digital frequency meters, and other instruments. While engaging in productive labor, they listen to teachers and technicians giving special lectures in conjunction with production.

    既要学习好　又要劳动好
    山东工学院学生学习劳动热情奋发
    据新华社济南22日电　新学期开始以来，山东工学院学生在既要学习好又要劳动好的口号下，正热情奋发地参加学习和劳动。
    首先是各班级学生政治理论学习积极性很高。他们除了认真学好每周一天的政治课以外，还利用业余时间自动学习政治理论。
    全院学生进一步加强了业务课程的学习，刻苦钻研的风气已在各班初步形成。金属工艺系许多班级提出了听课时思想要高度集中，复习时效率要高，完成作业质量要高的“三高”口号。在党委的领导下，学院的教师们也都和学生一起，采取各种措施，提高教学质量。发电厂专业二年级的学习小组在教师讲完一章课后即进行小结，并以黑板报、大字报形式帮助复习。电机及电器专业二年级学生在党支部的领导和教师的指导下，组织起来进行集体讨论，帮助不少同学提高了学习效率。基础理论课的学习在各个班级都受到了进一步的重视。本学期以来，基础理论的教学有了很大的加强，教材内容除了保持应有的系统性以外，并且力求结合实际，结合生产。化学、物理等课的教师都在这些方面作了不少尝试。
    科学研究活动也在许多班级中展开了。本学期班级科学研究活动的一个特色是结合专业，结合教学，结合生产。压力加工及机器专业二年级在总结已有经验的基础上，拟定了以研究和制造轴承为中心的科学研究生产规划，现在正在整顿充实原有的轴承厂的设备及压力加工车间有关设备，以便投入科学研究和生产。
    这个学院学生的生产劳动，新学期正在结合教学积极进行。机械制造系与中国科学院山东分院动力机械研究所协作研究的内燃水泵，已设计完毕，开始投入试制。六千瓩汽轮机正由这个学院的机床厂赶制，参加生产的机械制造系一年级学生有不少原来就是四级以上的工人。在电机系电器厂内参加生产劳动的电机及电器专业一年级学生，正在生产六千瓩发电设备所需的电流互感器，电压互感器、少油断路器等。在电子仪器厂里，无线电技术专业一年级学生正在为这个专业的无线电基础实验室制造一批设备，如万用电源、稳压电源、数字频率表等多种仪器。他们一边进行生产劳动，一边听取教师及技工结合生产讲授的专题。
