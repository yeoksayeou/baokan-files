Steel City Night
By Our Reporters Gu Feng, Gu Tiefeng, Lu Yin

Anshan, the Steel City – this sleepless city, with the arrival of spring, its night scenery is even more magnificent than its daytime views. Every night, after a full day's work, the steelworkers have not yet left the site, and tens of thousands of people ready for the night battle surge into the factory like a tide. At this time, the spotlights hanging on the iron towers on both sides of the factory's roads emit dazzling beams of light, guiding people on their way; electric locomotives and trains loaded with ore, molten iron, and steel roar and shuttle back and forth just like during the day. On the left side of the factory area, the molten iron and steel pouring out of the blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces turn the night sky red, scattering countless golden sparks, as dazzling as the ever-changing fireworks on Beijing's "May Day" night.

"Produce eighteen million tons of steel!" What a powerful call. For this, the Anshan Iron and Steel workers are carrying out a vigorous high-yield, high-quality red flag competition. The production records created during the day have not yet been tallied, and new good news comes from the night battle. During this fiery battle late at night, we heard the skilled steelmakers on the large fixed open-hearth furnaces announce "four blessings arriving at the door" with joy. In the No. 1 Medium Plate Plant, we also saw workers carrying production reports and beating gongs and drums, knocking on the Party committee's door in the middle of the night. The hundreds of thousands of Anshan Iron and Steel workers who are seizing steel from time are continuing their intense battle beside the blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling mills while people are fast asleep.

	At Blast Furnace No. 10
On an ordinary night in March, we came to the Ironmaking Plant along the brightly lit factory road. Looking ahead through the night, the huge blast furnaces in front of us looked even more majestic at night.

Walking forward along the two rows of blast furnaces, we climbed onto the largest blast furnace in the country, No. 10.

The blast furnace was about to tap iron, and we turned from behind the furnace to the front. Tapping iron is another intense battle for ironmaking workers. Several furnace front workers moved electric drills to tap the iron notch. The electric drill rotated rapidly forward, and in just over ten minutes, the iron notch was opened. Red-hot molten iron roared out of the iron notch, and in an instant, the long iron ditch turned into a red-hot iron river. The workers told us that the interval between this iron tapping and the last iron tapping was only two hours and forty minutes. One iron tapping fills three large cans, which is two hundred and several dozen tons at a time.

In the blast furnace duty room, we found furnace chief Zhang Lu, who was attentively observing the blast furnace instruments. We had heard some stories about him a few days ago, such as how he always turned around on the furnace day and night in order to let the No. 10 blast furnace tap iron smoothly as soon as possible. However, we never expected that the person in charge of this largest blast furnace in the country was a young man who was still studying at the Northeast Institute of Technology three years ago and is only twenty-six years old this year.

Zhang Lu flipped through the statistics table in his hand and said to us, "The production situation of our furnace this month is not bad. In the first ten days, we overproduced 1,296 tons of iron over the plan." His face was full of excitement when he spoke. Indeed, how could he not be happy! Blast Furnace No. 10 is currently the largest blast furnace in the country, but they have already successfully mastered it in less than four months since it was put into production. In February, the entire furnace overproduced more than 3,800 tons of iron over the plan, and in March, they plan to increase production by another 4,000 tons.

	Ten Thousand Steel Flowers Compete with the Stars
Bypassing one giant blast furnace after another, holding onto the iron handrails, we came to the brightly lit steelmaking plant. On the left side of the plant, which was as bright as day, a long row of huge open-hearth furnaces, stretching as far as the eye could see, was spewing out long flames, and the smoke rolling in the sky above the plant had long been dyed with streaks of red light.

After a bell rang, the Youth Friendship Furnace was about to tap steel. The young furnace chief, Zhang Guangzhu, raised an iron spoon and took the last steel sample from the furnace; an assistant, Yang Wensheng, led several workers to the back of the furnace to open the steel tapping notch.

In a night furnace repair team, we met Wen Yucheng, the Communist Youth League group leader, who is the second assistant of the Youth Friendship Furnace. This young man is only twenty years old this year. Steelmaking foreman Guan Jingchen said to us proudly: Wen Yucheng is a good young man who works exceptionally well, and he was just rated as an advanced producer of the entire plant these two days. As he was speaking, Wen Yucheng came over, and when he realized that they were talking about him, he hurriedly took over the conversation embarrassedly: "Our Youth Friendship Furnace is really amazing. This year's steel output will account for 1.3% of the country's total. In January and February, we overfulfilled our tasks. In February, the four youth open-hearth furnaces competed, and we also won the mobile red flag!"

	Fierce Battle Beside the Rolling Mill
The fierce night battle is also going on in Anshan Iron and Steel's dozen or so rolling mills. When we stepped into the famous Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the large slogan "One Plant Becomes Five Plants" hanging on the martial arts competition stage during the day looked particularly fresh under the night lights. During the Great Leap Forward last year, this factory rolled out 150,000 tons of steel tubes, exceeding the factory's design capacity by two times. When discussing the national plan this year, the workers proposed "One Plant Becomes Five Plants" again, determined to roll out 300,000 tons of various steel tubes throughout the year.

Zhang Jintian, the young night shift foreman of the hot rolling section, enthusiastically guided us to see the night battle of the tube rolling workers. Here, the workers were operating nervously beside the hot steel billets, no less than those at the blast furnaces or open-hearth furnaces.

We climbed over the uneven iron railing bridge and boarded the No. 4 operating platform. We saw several workers, sweating profusely from being roasted in front of the heating furnace, holding steel chisels tightly in their hands, constantly poking the red-hot steel billets out of the furnace. At this time, the automatic feeding machine sent it to the roller table of the piercing machine. The young worker Yang Fuzhe, standing on the operating platform, observed the operation of the machine intently, and pressed the buttons methodically. Then, the two drum-like rollers clamped the steel billet and rotated rapidly. The steel billet rotated and moved towards the mandrel in the middle of the rollers. In just over ten seconds, the short, thick steel billet was pierced with a heart-piercing round eye by the mandrel, turning into a rough steel tube, and then automatically rolled towards the rolling mill.

Yang Fuzhe told us that the No. 4 operating platform is the lifeline of the hot rolling section. For every minute it runs faster, the rolling mill will roll out four more steel tubes. The No. 4 operating platform is also the command post of the hot rolling section. The operators standing here must not only operate the six buttons accurately, but also keep an eye on all directions and manage fifteen different signals. Wherever a fitter is needed, wherever raw materials are lacking, wherever an accident occurs, as long as the operator makes a gesture, the signal must be pressed quickly, and after a burst of clear whistles, someone will take care of the matter.

When we returned to the dispatch room, the dispatcher enthusiastically said to us: In the first hour tonight, 250 steel tubes were rolled out. Next, we will roll boiler steel tubes of excellent quality for Harbin. The workers have already held a meeting and are determined to roll out 1,845 tubes in eight hours tonight.

Stepping out of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, it was already half past eleven at night. We also went to visit the workers who were fighting to roll heavy rails. As soon as we stepped into the tall and spacious factory building of the large rolling mill, an atmosphere of fierce battle firmly gripped our hearts and minds. The first shift workers, who were about to get off work at twelve o'clock, were seizing the last moment, determined to roll out more heavy rails. At the same time, the second shift workers, who started work at midnight, had already arrived at the factory and were holding a pre-shift flying meeting. One higher than the other targets, and one more concrete than the other measures, after the workers' enthusiastic discussion, were written on the eye-catching "Leap Forward" board. Seeing that it was almost twelve o'clock, the workers, holding high the night battle target board, beat gongs and drums, and rushed to the rolling mill to replace the first shift workers who had worked for eight hours. At this time, the giant rolling mill was still roaring and running, and pieces of red-hot steel billets were rapidly passing through the rolling mill, and after being rolled through eleven grooves, it turned into a long dragon-like heavy rail, rushing towards the hot saw...

    钢都之夜
    本报记者　谷峰　顾铁风　鲁音
    钢都鞍山——这座不眠的城市，随着春天的到来，夜晚的景色比白天壮丽多了。每当夜幕降临，忙碌了一整天的钢铁工人还未离开现场，成千上万个准备夜战的人们，又像潮水般地涌进工厂。这时候，挂在厂区公路两旁铁塔上的聚光灯，发射出耀眼的光柱，向人们指引着去路；一辆辆满载矿石、铁水、钢材的电机车和火车吼叫着，和白昼一样地穿来穿去；在厂区的左侧，从高炉、平炉里倾泻而出的铁水、钢水，使夜空变得通红，它们散放着数不清的金花，像北京“五一”之夜千变万化的焰火一样，绚丽夺目。
      “生产一千八百万吨钢”，这是多么有力的召唤。为了这，鞍钢职工们正在开展着热火朝天的高产优质红旗竞赛。白天创造的生产纪录，还来不及统计，夜战中又传来了新的佳音。在这火炽般战斗的夜半时分，我们曾听到过大型固定式平炉上的炼钢能手们，传出了“四喜临门”的喜报；在第一中板厂，我们也曾看到过职工们抬着生产捷报、敲打着锣鼓，半夜三更去敲党委的大门。向时间夺取钢铁的鞍钢十几万职工，就是这样在人们睡熟了的时候，继续紧张地战斗在高炉、平炉和轧钢机旁。
          在十号高炉上
    3月里的一个普通的夜晚，我们踏着灯火通明的厂区公路来到炼铁厂。透过夜幕向前望去，眼前那一座座巨大的高炉，夜里显得更加雄伟。
    挨着两排高炉群向前走去，我们爬上了全国最大的十号高炉。
    高炉快要出铁了，我们从炉后转到炉前来。出铁，对炼铁工人来说又是一场紧张的战斗。几个炉前工搬来了电钻在打出铁口。电钻急速地旋转着向前钻进，只十多分钟，出铁口就被掏开了。通红的铁水咆哮着从出铁口滚滚冲出，一霎时那长长的出铁沟就变成了通红的铁河。工人们告诉我们说：这次出铁同上次出铁的间隔时间只有两小时四十分。出一次铁水装满三大罐，一次就是二百几十吨。
    我们在高炉值班室，找到了正在这里聚精会神地观察高炉仪表的炉长张鲁。关于他，前几天我们已经听到过一些故事，例如说他为了让十高炉尽快顺利出铁，白天夜里总在炉子上转，等等。但是，我们绝没有想到掌握这座全国最大高炉的负责人，却是一位三年前还在东北工学院读书，今年只有二十六岁的年青人。
    张鲁翻腾着手里的统计表向我们说：“这个月份我们炉子的生产情况还不坏，头十天超计划增产了一千二百九十六吨铁。”他在谈话时，脸上充满了兴奋的笑容。真的，他怎么能不高兴呢！十号高炉是目前全国最大的高炉，可是投入生产不到四个月，他们就已经顺利地掌握了它。2月份全炉超计划增产生铁三千八百多吨，3月份他们计划再增产四千吨。
        万朵钢花赛星星
    绕过一座座巨型高炉，扶着铁扶梯，我们来到火光通明的炼钢厂。在明亮如同白昼的厂房左边，这时候一长排望不到头的巨大平炉，正在喷吐着长长的火焰，厂房上空滚腾着的烟雾早被染上了一道一道红光。
    一阵钟声响过，青年友谊炉要出钢了。年青的炉长张广珠，举起铁勺，从炉内取出最后一次钢样；一助手杨文生领着几个工人早已跑到炉后打开了出钢口。
    在一支夜间补炉队伍里，我们碰到了共青团小组长温玉成，他是青年友谊炉的二助手。这个小伙子今年才二十岁。炼钢工长关景臣得意地对我们说：温玉成是个干活出色的好小伙子，这两天才被评为全厂的先进生产者。正说着，温玉成走了过来，当他发现是在说他时，不好意思地赶快把话接了去：“我们青年友谊炉可真了不起，今年的钢产量要占全国总数1.3％，1月份、2月份，都超额完成了任务。2月份四座青年平炉竞赛，我们还获得了优胜流动红旗呢！”
        轧钢机旁的酣战
    激烈的夜战同样在鞍钢的十几个轧钢厂里进行着。当我们迈进了著名的无缝钢管厂，白天挂在比武擂台上的那幅“一厂变五厂”的大字标语牌，在夜晚的灯光下显得格外清新。在去年大跃进中，这个工厂曾经轧出了十五万吨钢管，超过建厂设计能力两倍；今年讨论国家计划时，工人们又提出“一厂变五厂”，决心全年轧出各种钢管三十万吨。
    年轻的热轧工段值班工长张金田，热情地引导我们去看轧管工人的夜战。在这里，工人们在火热的钢坯旁边紧张操作，丝毫不亚于高炉或平炉。
    我们爬过高低不平的铁栏杆桥，登上四号操作台，只见几个在加热炉前被烤得汗流浃背的工人，手里紧握着钢钎，不时地从炉内往炉外拨出烧红的钢坯。这时，自动化的送料机就把它送到穿孔机的辊道上。站在操作台上的青年工人杨福哲，一面目不斜视地观察机器运转的情形，一面有条不紊地按动着电钮，于是那两根鼓一样的辊子，夹着钢坯飞快地旋转起来。钢坯一面转，一面向辊子中间的顶针方向前进，只有十几秒钟，短粗的钢坯被顶针穿了一个透心的圆眼，变成一根粗糙的钢管，然后自动滚向轧管机。
    杨福哲告诉我们，四号操作台，是热轧工段的命根子。它运转的速度快一分钟，轧管机就会多轧出四根钢管。四号操作台，又是热轧工段的司令台。站在这里的操作人员，不仅要分秒不差地操纵着六个电钮，还必须眼观四方，掌管着十五种不同的信号。哪里需要钳工，哪里原料少了，哪里出了事故，只要操作工人一打手势，这里就必须敏捷地按动信号，一阵清脆的汽笛响过，该办的事情都有人去办了。
    当我们回到调度室的时候，调度员热情地对我们说：今晚的第一个小时，就轧出钢管二百五十根；下边，就要为哈尔滨轧制质量优良的锅炉钢管了。工人们已经开过会，决心在今晚八小时内，轧出一千八百四十五根。
    走出无缝钢管厂，已是夜十一点半了。我们又去访问了为轧制重轨而战的工人们。一迈进大型轧钢厂高大宽敞的厂房，一股鏖战的气氛就紧紧慑住了我们的心神。夜十二点就要下班的甲班工人，正在抓紧最后的时刻，决心再多轧出一些重轨来。与此同时，午夜零点开始接班的乙班工人，早已来到工厂，正举行着班前的飞行集会。一个比一个高的指标，一个比一个具体的措施，经过工人的热烈讨论，都被写在醒目的“跃进牌”上。看看快到十二点了，工人们高举夜战的指标牌，敲打着锣鼓，涌向轧钢机旁，接替已经劳动了八小时的甲班工人。这时，巨型轧钢机仍在轰鸣地运转着，一块块通红的钢坯，急速地穿过轧钢机，经过十一个槽孔的压轧，变成了一条长龙似的重轨，奔向热切锯的方向……。（附图片）
