The Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe has been performing in Beijing since the 15th and has been welcomed and praised by the capital's literary and art circles and audiences. They have brought more than forty carefully selected traditional plays and selected outstanding actors from the province for a grand performance lasting one month.

The Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe will perform more than ten full-length plays and thirty to forty medium and small-scale plays this time. Among them are excellent plays such as "The Story of Fu Nu," "Forced Marriage," "Tan Ji'er," and "Mu Guiying," which have been performed in Beijing before and have been improved through processing; newly reorganized and performed traditional famous plays such as "Red Plum Pavilion," "Disturbing Qi Court," "The Story of the Hairpin and the Ring," "Three Earth Gods," and many wonderful excerpts, such as "Baihua Presents Sword," "Stopping the Horse," "A Good World," "Meeting Brothers at Mount Wutai," "Double Bow to the Moon," "Brahma Palace," "Cooking Kuai Che," "Beating the Melon to Attract a Son-in-Law," "Sending Lamps in the Qin Room," etc., as well as the modern play "Ding Youjun," which portrays the deeds of revolutionary heroes. The scripts of these plays are mostly concise, rigorous, witty, and vivid, and the performances are delicate and profound. Among them, nearly half are comedies. For example, the newly reorganized satirical comedy "Disturbing Qi Court," which mainly features clowns, describes the story of the princes of the King of Qi in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods fighting for the throne and killing each other, exposing the ugly souls of the feudal ruling class to the fullest. Currently, Sichuan Opera has discovered more than 1,400 traditional plays.

In addition to famous actors Chen Shufang, Zhou Qihe, Yang Shuying, Xu Qianyun, Zhou Yuxiang, Yuan Yukun, and others, most of the performers who came to Beijing this time are young actors who already have proficient performance skills.

    丰富多彩的川剧艺术
    受到首都观众欢迎
    本报讯　四川省川剧演出团自15日在北京演出以来，受到首都文艺界和观众的欢迎和赞扬。他们带来精选的四十多个传统剧目，选拔了全省出色的演员，将进行为期一个月的盛大公演。
    四川省川剧演出团，这次将演出十多个大戏和三、四十个中小型剧目，其中有以前在京演出过、又经加工提高的“芙奴传”、“拉郎配”、“谭记儿”、“穆桂英”等优秀剧目，有新近整理排演的传统名剧“红梅阁”、“闹齐庭”、“荆钗记”、“三土地”和许多精彩的折子戏，如“百花赠剑”、“拦马”、“人间好”、“五台会兄”、“双拜月”、“梵王宫”、“烹蒯辙”“打瓜招亲”、“琴房送灯”等，还有表现革命英雄事迹的现代剧目“丁佑君”。这些剧目的剧词，大都简洁严谨、风趣生动，表演也细腻深刻。其中，将近一半是喜剧。如新近整理的以丑角为主的讽刺喜剧“闹齐庭”，描写了春秋战国时齐王的诸公子争夺王位互相残杀的故事，淋漓尽致地揭露了封建统治阶级的丑恶灵魂。目前川剧发掘的传统剧目已有一千四百多个。
    这次来京演出的，除著名演员陈书舫、周企何、杨淑英、许倩云、周裕祥、袁玉坤等人外，大部分是已具有熟练表演技巧的青年演员。
