Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 12th: Arab United Republic President Nasser delivered a speech in Damascus on the 11th to a crowd protesting against the suppression of the rebellion and opposing the Communist Party in Iraq. In his speech, he fiercely attacked Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim and the Iraqi Communist Party.

Nasser attacked Qasim for pursuing a policy "hostile" to the Arab United Republic. He attacked Qasim for "organizing" demonstrations and "attempting to split the Arab United Republic." He said, "If the secessionists of Iraq hope to divide the people of the Arab United Republic through these demonstrations and conspiracies, he will never succeed, because the people of the Arab United Republic believe in their mission."

Nasser also attacked the Iraqi Communist Party for "receiving its orders from abroad" and "working for foreigners."

In his speech, Nasser stated that he would never "abandon our mission" of unifying the Arab world.

Those who participated in the anti-communist demonstrations shouted slogans attacking "the hateful barbaric acts in Iraq" and also shouted slogans such as "The martyrs of Iraq enter paradise" and "Down with Communist opportunism." Cairo radio and newspapers also extensively reported attacks on the Iraqi government on the 11th.

Since the rebellion launched by Shawwaf, the former commander of the Fifth Brigade of the Iraqi Army, newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations of the Arab United Republic have continuously disseminated news for the Shawwaf group. The Middle East News Agency of the Arab United Republic published a special communique on the 8th, citing a broadcast from the so-called "Mosul Radio Station," which forwarded in detail the "communiques" of Shawwaf's "revolutionary command." It said that the Shawwaf rebels had received "widespread support" and controlled the Mosul area.

    新华社12日讯　大马士革消息：阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔11日在大马士革向一批举行反对伊拉克镇压叛乱和反对共产党的游行的人群发表了讲话。他在讲话中猛烈攻击伊拉克总理卡塞姆和伊拉克共产党。
    纳赛尔攻击卡塞姆奉行“敌视”阿联的政策。他攻击卡塞姆“组织”示威游行，“企图分裂阿拉伯联合共和国”。他说，“如果伊拉克的分裂者希望通过这些示威和阴谋来分裂阿联人民，他决不会成功，因为阿联人民相信他们的使命。”
    纳赛尔还攻击伊拉克共产党“从外国接受它的命令”，“为外国人工作”。
    纳赛尔在讲话中表示决不“放弃我们的使命”：统一阿拉伯世界。
    那些反共游行的人喊着攻击“在伊拉克的可恨的野蛮行动”的口号，还喊着“伊拉克的烈士进入天堂”、“打倒共产党机会主义”等口号。开罗电台和报纸在11日也大量报道攻击伊拉克政府的消息。
    在伊拉克陆军前第五旅旅长沙瓦夫发动叛乱以后，阿联的报刊、通讯社和电台即不断为沙瓦夫集团传播消息。阿联的中东通讯社曾经在8日发表特别公报，援引所谓“摩苏尔电台”的广播，详细转发了沙瓦夫的“革命司令部”的“公报”。它说，沙瓦夫叛军得到“广泛的支持”，控制了摩苏尔地区。
