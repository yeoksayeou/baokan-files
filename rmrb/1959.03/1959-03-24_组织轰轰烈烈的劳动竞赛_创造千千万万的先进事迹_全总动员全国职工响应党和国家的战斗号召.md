Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to all workers to greet the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have decided to convene a National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade in the capital in the fourth quarter of this year. This is a great battle call for a great leap forward in production issued by the Party and the State to all our workers. We must respond to the convening of this conference with extremely warm feelings and soaring enthusiasm. All workers across the country should be more actively mobilized to strive for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 and to complete and overfulfill the national production and construction plan for 1959 ahead of schedule.

The 1959 economic plan, centered on the four major targets, is a magnificent plan. To ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of this magnificent plan, we must make tremendous efforts and constantly push the current production movement forward; under the leadership of the Party, on the basis of the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, further implement the general line of socialist construction, arouse higher labor enthusiasm, and launch a vigorous socialist labor competition to vigorously carry out technological revolution, technological innovation, and increase labor productivity.

In the socialist labor competition, we must show soaring enthusiasm, continue to oppose right-leaning conservatism, break superstitions, liberate our minds, carry forward the communist style of seeking truth from facts and daring to think, speak, and act, strive to be the best, catch up with the advanced, overcome all difficulties, and achieve a comprehensive leap forward. We must hold even higher the red flag of communist ideology, use the spirit of diligent study, and use the methods of big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and great debates to thoroughly discuss the national plan unit by unit, formulate advanced targets, adopt advanced measures, and universally set off a high tide of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced.

In the socialist labor competition, we must combine hard work with smart work, focus on key production areas and weak links, and vigorously engage in technological revolution. We must exert full effort, tap potential, practice careful calculation and strict budgeting, increase production and practice economy. We must improve tools and equipment, technological processes, product structure, and operating methods, improve labor organization, greatly improve product quality, and greatly increase labor productivity.

In the socialist labor competition, we must implement the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard, carry out communist large-scale collaboration, take steel as the key link to achieve a comprehensive leap forward, prioritize the whole nation over local areas, prioritize the whole over the parts; concentrate forces to guarantee key areas and support key areas. Within enterprises, we must strengthen unity and mutual assistance, give full play to collective wisdom, and make enterprises, workshops, and groups twist into one rope and combine into one force to improve together and win greater victories on the production front.

Trade union organizations and trade union workers across the country must actively carry out work in the socialist labor competition, under the leadership of the Party, in coordination with administrative departments and all relevant parties. Go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, and eat, live, and work with the masses. Carry out in-depth political work among the masses and strive to improve the communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers. Adopt a variety of forms to organize and mobilize competition between individuals, between groups, and between workshops. Vigorously organize inter-factory competitions. Grasp typical cases, summarize and promote advanced experiences, and drive the overall situation. Enthusiastically care for the political, cultural, and technical learning of workers, care for the material and cultural life of workers, and conscientiously implement the two-pronged approach of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other. Constantly push the competition movement to new heights.

Comrade workers: This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, a year of greater leap forward, and a decisive year for three years of hard work. We must warmly respond to the call of the Party and the government, be full of fighting spirit and high morale in the socialist labor competition, produce greater and better achievements and thousands upon thousands of advanced deeds to dedicate to the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry. We must guarantee to the Party and the government: to complete and overfulfill the great plan of national production and construction in 1959 ahead of schedule, and to achieve a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward!
