    Spring Plowing Busily Under Tianmu Mountain
    Jiang Feng

    When I arrived at the Tianmu Mountain People's Commune in Zhejiang, the peak of Tianmu Mountain was still covered with unmelted snow; the willows by the stream had not yet sprouted; the whistling wind still made people feel cold, but the people's hearts were already filled with spring.

    Before dawn, the fields were already bustling. As the commune's clock struck four, the work call rang out everywhere. Male and female commune members, laughing and joking, carried manure buckets and hoes towards the fields. Everyone wanted to get an early start to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat and 500 jin of rapeseed this year, and to get an early start for an even greater leap forward in agricultural production this year. The members of the Hengxi Production Team, in order to take the lead in this friendly competition of catching up with each other, discussed it in a meeting and advanced the work start time by another hour. When they returned from the dense fog of early spring to eat breakfast, they had already completed one-third of the workload of the previous day.

    Everywhere in the fields, one could see earth-shattering labor scenes; the young men greeted this decisive spring with the greatest enthusiasm. Wherever there were young men working, there was a scene of spring. For example, at the Jiatang Reservoir construction site, due to objective difficulties, there was not enough time to thoroughly carry out technological innovation and eliminate shoulder carrying, but the task was urgent, so the young men demonstrated a high degree of heroism. Everyone scrambled to carry heavy loads. Feng Laixing, a young farmer from Licun, felt that carrying with a shoulder pole was not enough, so he simply discarded the shoulder pole and used a door plank to carry 430 jin at a time, rushing around the construction site as if flying. From his vigorous steps, one could feel the unique youthful vitality of young people.

    In the manure accumulation army in Zhangcun, one could see at a glance that many elderly people were as spirited as the young people. In their ranks was an elderly man with silver hair, Grandpa Lü Jinge from Jingli Village, who was sixty-seven years old this year. The team had always taken care of him, thinking that he was old and should rest well at home and enjoy his happy old age in leisure. However, the tide of the greater leap forward in spring impacted his heart, making him feel restless. Every day he had to squeeze into the ranks of the young people and swing his hoe with the young men. One day, before going to work, he was stopped by the production team leader, who advised him to go home and rest. He replied very simply: "Everyone is making a great leap forward, how can I sit still!"

    The elderly couldn't sit still, and the children were even more restless. Spring, what an enticing season! Of course, the children were not just playing to their heart's content in the spring, but were as happy as the adults in the spring fields. Inspired by the miracle of Li Shuihong, a little girl from Shimen, who transplanted 60,000 seedlings in one day last spring, the little girls were all eager to try and show their skills in this year's intense spring plowing production. Uncle Chaoshui's child, Lingsun, who is only eight years old this year, has been carrying a hoe on his back since the Spring Festival, following his father, cutting wheat in the fields. Someone teased him: "Little devil, what are you doing here?" He replied simply: "If others take airplanes, can I ride a snail?"

    天目山下忙春耕
    蒋风
    当我来到浙江天目山人民公社的时候，天目山顶峰上还残留着没有融尽的残雪；溪边的柳树也还未冒出嫩芽；呼啸的风吹来，仍使人们感到寒意，可是，人们的心里却早已是春天了。
    天不亮，田野里就沸腾起来了。公社里的时钟敲了四下，出工的铜锣就到处唱起来了。男女社员嘻嘻哈哈的挑着粪担，背着锄头走向田间。谁都要为今年的小麦亩产千斤，油菜五百斤起个早，要为今年农业生产更大的跃进起个早。横溪生产队的社员们，为了争取在这一场你追我赶的友谊竞赛中占个先，他们开会一商量，又把出工时间提早了一个小时。当他们迎着弥漫春晨的浓雾归来早餐的时候，已经完成从前三分之一劳动日的工作量了。
    田野上，随处可以看到惊天动地的劳动场面；青年小伙子们以最大的干劲来迎接这个有决定性意义的春天。哪里有小伙子在劳动，哪里就是一片春光。如在夹塘水库工地上，由于客观条件的困难，还来不及彻底的进行技术革新，消灭肩膀挑，可是任务又很紧，青年小伙子就表现了高度的英雄气概，大家抢着挑重担；里村青年农民冯来兴感到用扁担挑不过瘾，索性丢了扁担用门杠挑，一挑就是四百三十斤，飞也似的奔忙在工地上，从他那矫健的脚步上，就会使人感受到青年人独有的青春的活力。
    在樟村的积肥大军中，一眼望去，还有不少老年人和青年人一样意气风发。他们的队伍中，有一位银发的老人，他是井里村的吕金格老伯伯，今年六十七岁了。队里一向照顾他，认为他年纪大了，要他在家里好好地休息，安闲地欢度他幸福的晚年。可是，春天更大跃进的波涛冲激着他的心，使他感到闲不住，每天都要挤到青年人的队伍里，和小伙子们一起挥动着锄头。有一天在出工前被生产队长拉住，劝他回家休息，他回答得很干脆：“大家都在大跃进，叫我怎么坐得住呢！”
    老年人坐不住，小孩子更加坐不住了。春天了，多诱人的季节呀！当然，孩子们也不是为了在春天玩个痛快，而是和大人们一样欢跃在春天的田野里。小女孩们受到石门小姑娘厉水红去年春天创造一天插秧六万丛的奇迹的鼓舞，今年也都跃跃欲试，想在今年紧张的春耕生产中一试身手。朝水伯伯的孩子令孙，今年才八岁，从春节以后，每天清早背了锄头，跟在爸爸后面，下田削麦。有人逗他：“小鬼，你来作什么？”，他回答得干脆：“别人坐飞机，我能骑蜗牛吗？”
