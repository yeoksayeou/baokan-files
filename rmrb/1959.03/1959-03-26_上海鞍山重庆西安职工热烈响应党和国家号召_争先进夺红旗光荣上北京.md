Xinhua News Agency report: The Party and the State's rallying call has greatly inspired the broad masses of workers in cities such as Shanghai, Anshan, Chongqing, and Xi'an. Striving for advancement, seizing red flags, and creating even more outstanding achievements to go to Beijing have quickly become resounding slogans for workers to welcome the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade.

    Shanghai
    More than a million workers in Shanghai are determined to greet the conference by completing and overfulfilling the state's production plans ahead of schedule. One hundred thousand steelworkers have expressed their determination to demonstrate their skills in the high-yield, high-quality competition, to make a great technological revolution, and to resolutely overfulfill the task of 1.6 million tons of steel assigned to Shanghai by the state this year. The Youth Rolling Mill Team of the No. 2 Branch of the Xin Hu Steel Plant unanimously stated that they would humbly learn from the veteran workers, produce more and better steel billets and steel, and strive to go to Beijing. Workers on the electromechanical industrial front have also made assurances to complete the manufacturing tasks of the six major pieces of equipment urgently needed for construction on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity, and in complete sets to greet the conference. Workers in the engine workshop of the Jiangnan Shipyard, who are manufacturing rolling mills, held discussions on the 24th, resolving to rush to complete two sets of rolling mills before May. Hundreds of thousands of workers in the light industry and textile industry systems have decided to launch a greater production upsurge. The Ding Fudi team of the State-owned No. 12 Cotton Mill, which is catching up with the Yi Shijuan advanced team, immediately improved the doffing method after hearing the news of the representative conference. It used to take 40 minutes to doff nine spindles, but now it only takes 30 minutes. Workers in units directly under the Shanghai Railway Bureau held meetings on the evening of the 24th to discuss how to be good pioneers and greet the conference with practical actions. Workers on the construction site of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant, who are working hard, are determined to do the work of two people with one person. The vast number of workers in the commercial sector are also actively preparing to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council with outstanding work achievements.

    Anshan
    The vast steel army of Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) is determined to push the high-yield and high-quality red flag competition to a new climax, create outstanding achievements in the national battle to seize 18 million tons of steel, and strive to attend the conference of heroes in Beijing. Workers in many factories and mines have held large and small meetings to discuss the issue of responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and immediately revised and formulated new conditions for the red flag competition. All the workers of the Angang Seamless Steel Tube Plant held a skills competition, resolving to complete the state's assigned production task of seamless steel tubes this year ahead of schedule, and strive to achieve the requirement of "turning one factory into five factories." The workers of the Angang No. 1 Medium Plate Mill, who have already completed the first quarter's production task ahead of schedule, stated that they would achieve "red every month, red every quarter, and all-round red throughout the year," and complete this year's production plan 40 days ahead of schedule. The workers of the No. 24 open-hearth furnace produced two furnaces of steel in a time that was more than one hour shorter than planned on the 24th. The steelworkers of the No. 23 open-hearth furnace stated that they would shorten the smelting time of each furnace of steel by an average of 2.50 minutes compared with the state plan this year, and increase the production of 50,000 tons of high-quality steel for the country. The ironworkers fighting on the blast furnaces of Angang created the highest daily output record since the beginning of this year on the 24th, overfulfilling the daily plan by 3.6%.

    Chongqing
    In the past two days, the broad masses of workers in Chongqing have held discussions with great excitement on how to create more and better achievements to greet the representative conference. Huang Rongchang, a nationally renowned industrial labor model and worker at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, held a discussion on the 24th with the workers in his mechanized team; they unanimously guaranteed that they would mechanize the steelmaking workshop ahead of schedule, gradually eliminate the heavy physical labor in transportation, and work with the steelworkers to make the greatest efforts to complete this year's steelmaking task ahead of schedule. The workers of the converter plant and open-hearth plant of this company have also studied measures and proposed the great leap forward indicators for the second quarter. Liao Shigang, a technical innovation expert from the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant who has been to Beijing many times to meet Chairman Mao, is determined to work with his partners to realize the plan of not receiving materials for more than 20 kinds of parts ahead of schedule, and to realize more than 1,000 technical innovation projects in a short period of time, and strive to go to Beijing again to meet Chairman Mao. The workers on the city's transportation and finance and trade fronts have also put forward their own and their units' fighting goals, striving to become advanced producers and advanced units.

    Xi'an
    The broad masses of workers in the Xi'an area warmly responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and determined to immediately launch a greater upsurge of production and create new achievements, striving to participate in the representative conference in Beijing. The workers of the Xi'an Steel Plant, who recently used local iron to make steel and rolled steel into finished products, are determined to continue to use local iron to make more good steel and roll out more and better steel products. Liu Deming, an excellent lathe operator at the state-owned Xi'an Machinery Plant, is determined to double the number of nozzles produced per shift in three months: 600 pieces in March, 800 pieces in April, 1,000 pieces in May, and 1,200 pieces per shift in June. The workers of the weaving workshop of the State-owned Xi'an No. 4 Cotton Mill held a mobilization meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, resolving to increase the first-class product rate to over 85% and overproduce more than 200,000 meters of cotton cloth. Workers in the railway and commercial systems have also held discussions, resolving to further carry out the "Red Flag Bearer" competition to greet the representative conference. Representatives of active elements of catering workers from industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province who are meeting in Xi'an are studying and seriously discussing the documents concerning the convening of the representative conference with unusual excitement, and expressing their willingness to further improve the canteen work of their units, ensure that the workers can better complete this year's leap forward plan.
