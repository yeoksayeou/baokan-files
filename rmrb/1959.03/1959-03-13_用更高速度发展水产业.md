    To pay great attention to accelerating the comprehensive operation of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery is the established policy on China's entire agricultural front, and it must be actively and conscientiously implemented. These five industries are of great importance to the people's livelihood, and the interrelationship between the five industries in production is also very close. If properly arranged, they can promote each other and develop together, further meeting the growing needs of the people's lives. Regarding this issue, this newspaper has already discussed some aspects in the editorials "Accelerating the Development of Animal Husbandry" and "Accelerating the Speed of Afforestation and Improving the Quality of Afforestation." Today, we will focus on another important aspect—the development of the aquatic products industry.
    Aquatic products are an important non-staple food in people's lives. "Eating fish and meat" is an important symbol of a prosperous people's life. Aquatic products have high nutritional value, containing a large amount of protein and a portion of fat, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron, etc., which are essential nutrients for people's health. At the same time, aquatic products are generally characterized by fresh taste, tender meat, and low prices, which makes them even more popular among the broad masses of people.
    In addition to being edible, aquatic products can also provide many important industrial and medicinal raw materials. For example, high-grade lubricating oil, cod liver oil, guanine hydrochloride, caffeine, soluble chitin, fish scale glue, and fish leather can be extracted from fish; brown algae gum, mannitol, iodine, potassium chloride, and Sargassum essence can be extracted from algae; shells can be used to make lime, shell powder, and cement, etc. These are all very useful industrial and medicinal raw materials. In addition, the waste parts other than those consumed can provide a large amount of high-grade feed for animal husbandry and a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for agriculture. Although China's comprehensive processing and utilization of aquatic products has just begun, the varieties produced last year alone included more than 40 kinds of medicines and pharmaceutical raw materials, more than 30 kinds of industrial raw materials, 6 kinds of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides, and 2 kinds of animal husbandry feed. With the development of production practice and scientific research, it is entirely possible to further expand the comprehensive utilization of various aquatic animals and plants in the future, so that it can provide more and better raw materials for industry, agriculture, medicine and health.
    Aquatic products are a specialized production, but in production, it is closely related to all aspects of the entire agricultural front and to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production. For example, the pond mud and lake mud after fish farming are rich in organic matter, which is a very good fertilizer for agriculture. One mu of fish pond mud can provide more than 50,000 jin of mud fertilizer. At present, the national water area for fish farming is 35 million mu. What a huge source of fertilizer this is! If calculated at 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, it can provide fertilizer for more than 170 million mu of farmland. Some areas adopt the method of combining sericulture, mulberry, and fishery, using silkworm pupae and silkworm feces to feed fish, fish pond mud to fertilize mulberry trees, and mulberry leaves to feed silkworms. Some are combined with pig raising, vegetable growing, and fish farming, using pig manure and pond mud to fertilize vegetables, and vegetable roots and leaves to feed fish and pigs. Therefore, the development of aquatic production can promote the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production; and the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production can also promote the development of aquatic production. China is rich in water resources, and the people's communes in many areas have a certain water area. With water, fish can be raised and aquatic production can be carried out. Last year, under the slogan of "Requisitioning wealth from the water," many areas renovated previously unused shallow seas, harbors, lakes, and reservoirs for aquaculture production, and obtained great benefits. Doumen People's Commune in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, produced 350,000 jin of commercial fish, which was exchanged for 46 small blast furnaces, 15 windmills, 83 wooden boats, 3 heads of cattle, and more than 30,000 jin of fertilizer, which played an important role in consolidating the people's commune and expanding reproduction.
    The Chinese people are advancing towards nature. The resources that nature can give to people are mainly mountains, plains, and water areas. To increase the wealth of the country and the people, and to make full use of natural resources to carry out socialist construction, we must not only advance to the mountains and plains, above and below ground, but also advance to the surface and depths of the water. The fundamental task of the aquatic products front is to develop all the nutritious and economically valuable animals and plants that can grow in the water, to improve the people's lives and serve the cause of socialist construction.
    In 1958, under the situation of the overall great leap forward in industry and agriculture in China, the aquatic products industry also achieved great development. The total output of aquatic products has increased from 3.12 million tons in 1957 to 6.02 million tons, an increase of nearly one time, which is equal to twice the cumulative increase in the first five-year plan. Both the amount of increase and the speed of development are unprecedented. However, it must be seen that China's aquatic products industry is still very backward and far from meeting the needs of the people's lives, and attention must be paid to increasing production in this area.
    Can we maintain the speed of the great leap forward in aquatic products last year or develop China's aquatic products industry at a higher speed than last year to meet the needs of the people across the country? Our answer is yes.
    China has very rich aquatic resources. The coastline of the country is as long as tens of thousands of kilometers, with vast marine fishing grounds available for fishing production. Among them, the 430,000 square nautical miles of continental shelf are the place where fish groups concentrate, breed and migrate, and the resources are particularly rich. The inland is even more crisscrossed with rivers, lakes, ponds and reservoirs scattered all over. Especially with the development of farmland water conservancy construction in the future, with the gradual realization of the great ideal of "three-three system" and large-scale landscaping in agricultural production, the water area will be further expanded, and the development of the aquatic products industry is even more limitless. At present, in the marine aspect, we still have a vast Southeast Sea fishing ground that has not been fully developed, and the middle and upper layer fish groups have not been more effectively caught; in the freshwater aspect, there are about 100 million mu of water area that can be used for aquaculture, but only more than 30 million mu were used for aquaculture last year; the area of seawater available for aquaculture is about 15 million mu, and only 1.5 million mu were utilized last year. Moreover, the average yield per unit area is also very low, with fish yielding only 117 jin per mu, which is more than 80 times different from the high yield of 10,000 jin that has already appeared; the average yield of shellfish is 640 jin per mu, which is also 15 times different from the yield of 10,000 jin per mu; the average yield of algae per mu is also several times different from the high yield record. It can be seen that China's aquatic potential is extremely large. If we utilize all the available sea and freshwater water areas for fishing and aquaculture, and increase the yield per unit area, develop the aquatic industry more and faster, and produce a sufficient quantity of aquatic products, it is entirely possible to meet the needs of the Chinese people.
    The practice in 1958 proved that the policy of focusing on aquaculture and actively developing fishing in aquatic production by relying on the masses and the people's communes is correct. Aquatic products can be divided into two aspects: "aquaculture" and "fishing." Fishing production mainly refers to the exploitation of natural resources in the vast oceans, rivers, and lakes, using boats, nets and other tools; aquaculture production refers to the breeding in all areas of the country as long as there is a water area. Both types of production are necessary, but from the perspective of the direction and policy of development, the focus of production should be placed on aquaculture, because aquaculture has greater potential, and has the advantages of small investment, high returns, and simple technology, and can become a production business that every people's commune in the country can and should develop. After the great leap forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people highly developed the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and also created rich experience in striving for a great leap forward in aquatic products. Many water areas that were previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture can be used for aquaculture after rectification; many varieties that were previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture can also be used for aquaculture; many aquatic seedlings that were previously considered unsuitable for artificial incubation have also been artificially incubated successfully. This has broken the long-standing boundary between water areas and varieties that can and cannot be cultured in aquatic production, and opened up an inexhaustible source for aquaculture production. In particular, the creation of the experience of dense stocking and intensive farming provides a reliable guarantee for greatly increasing the yield per unit area. All of this eloquently shows that the future of the aquatic industry is extremely broad. What is particularly important is that we have the rich experience of the overall great leap forward last year and have the people's commune, such a superior grass-roots organization, and have the great call of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the great revolution on the entire agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery front, which provides very favorable conditions for the whole party and the whole people to engage in the aquatic industry and for a greater leap forward in aquatic production.
    Of course, to turn possibility into reality, we must also make great efforts and make all necessary measures. These measures are mainly:
    First, vigorously promote the high-yield experience of 1958, promote the high-yield experience of the "experimental fields" of small water areas within several hundred mu created by the masses last year, and carry out a large-scale high-yield and bumper harvest campaign. This is the first key to striving for a greater harvest of aquatic products at present. It is necessary to give priority to stocking the fish species and other shellfish and algal seedlings that have been mastered in the smaller water areas that are more certain, and to conscientiously implement the eight-character intensive farming method of "water" (improving water quality and increasing water depth), "species" (mastering strong seedlings), "bait" (sufficient bait), "density" (reasonable dense stocking and intensive farming), "mixing" (mixed stocking of multiple varieties), "rotation" (rotating stocking and fishing), "prevention" (preventing diseases, insects, and pests), and "management" (dedicated management) to increase the yield per unit area.
    Second, vigorously engage in artificial incubation and strive for a bumper harvest of seedlings. This is the second key to striving for a greater harvest of aquatic products this year. Vigorously engaging in artificial incubation is not only related to the current output, but also to the output in the second year. In order to prepare a sufficient number of seedlings, it is necessary to adopt the policy of combining artificial incubation and fishing, and to shift from mainly fishing for natural seedlings to artificial incubation, and to promote the excellent varieties that have been successfully incubated, so as to diversify the aquaculture varieties. When promoting artificial incubation, it is also necessary to engage in mass movements like fishing for natural seedlings, break the mysterious views of artificial incubation, and achieve incubation in every commune and in every season, so that the seedlings of aquatic products can be fully resolved.
    Third, actively develop fishing production. Improving and improving marine and freshwater fishing production is also a key issue in the great development of aquatic products. In order to increase fishing output, in addition to consolidating the existing fishing ground positions in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, protecting and propagating resources, and stabilizing fishing output, it is also necessary to open up new fishing grounds in the East China Sea and South China Sea. At the same time, actively promote the successful experience in marine fishing last year, namely, implementing "finding" (finding fishing grounds), "reforming" (reforming fishing gear), "combining" (multiple tools combined operations), "protecting" (protecting resources), and "safety" (safe production) to increase the output of per boat and net. In terms of freshwater fishing, in addition to promoting the existing effective fishing gear and operation methods, it is also necessary to combine the characteristics of various water surfaces, learn and apply the successful experience of marine fishing, and change the current backward situation of fishing.
    Fourth, vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement. At present, labor shortage is a common phenomenon on the entire agricultural front. To solve the contradiction between insufficient labor and heavy tasks, the only way out is to find a way to improve labor efficiency. According to the labor force allocated to the aquatic products front in various places this year, whether it is fishing or aquaculture, whether it is seawater or freshwater, it is necessary to greatly improve labor efficiency to ensure a greater leap forward in the aquatic industry. Therefore, labor must be arranged reasonably, advanced operation methods must be promoted in a timely manner, and tool reform must be carried out vigorously. All localities should start now and launch a vigorous technical innovation movement.
    Under the inspiration of the Party's general line and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, based on the rich experience of the great leap forward in aquatic products in 1958, although there are still many difficulties in the struggle to strive for a greater leap forward in the aquatic industry in 1959, under the correct leadership of the Party, as long as we unswervingly implement the Party's mass line, rely on the soaring energy of the broad masses, oppose conservatism, break superstitions, make a big fuss about technological revolution, work hard, work hard, and work skillfully, and give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, we will surely achieve a greater leap forward on the aquatic products front and complete and overfulfill the glorious tasks given to the aquatic products front by the Party and the state.

    用更高速度发展水产业
    极大地注意加速发展农林牧副渔五业的综合经营，是我国整个农业战线上的确定方针，必须积极地认真地加以贯彻。这五业对于人民生活的关系是十分重大的，五业在生产上的相互关系也是十分密切的。安排好了，就可以达到相互促进共同发展，进一步满足人民生活日益增长的需要。关于这个问题，本报分别在“加速发展畜牧业”和“加快绿化速度，提高造林质量”的社论中，已经谈到一些，今天，我们再着重谈谈其中又一个重要方面——发展水产业的问题。
    水产是人民生活中一种重要的副食品，“吃鱼吃肉”是人民生活富裕的一个重要标志。水产品的营养价值很高，含有大量的蛋白质和一部分脂肪、醣、钙、磷、铁等，是人民身体健康十分必需的重要养分。同时由于水产品一般都具有味鲜肉细、价格低廉的特点，这就更为广大人民所欢迎。
    水产品除了食用之外，还可以提供许多种重要的工业和医药原料。例如在鱼体中，可以提炼出高级润滑油、鱼肝油、盐酸鸟粪素、咖啡咽、可溶性甲壳素、鱼鳞胶、鱼皮革等；在藻类中，可以提炼褐藻胶、甘露醇、碘、氯化钾、马尾藻精等；在贝壳中，可制造石灰、贝粉及水泥等等，这些都是很有用处的工业及医药原料。此外，食用以外的废弃部分，还可以为畜牧业提供大量的高级饲料和为农业提供大量的优质肥料。我国对水产品的综合加工利用虽然刚刚开始，仅去年制成的品种就已经有：药品及制药原料四十多种，工业原料三十多种，农业肥料及农药六种，畜牧业饲料二种。随着生产实践和科学试验研究工作的发展，今后进一步扩大各种水生动植物的综合利用，使它为工农业及医药卫生等方面提供更多更好的原料，是完全可以断言的。
    水产品是一种专业的生产，但是在生产上它又同整个农业战线的各个方面，同农林牧副各业都有着非常密切的关系。例如养鱼后的塘泥、湖泥含有丰富的有机物质，这是农业上很好的肥料。一亩鱼塘泥约可提供五万多斤泥肥，现在全国已经养鱼的水面是三千五百万亩，这是一个多么巨大的肥源！如果以亩施万斤肥计算，就可提供一亿七千多万亩的农田肥料。有的地区采取蚕、桑、渔三结合的办法进行经营，用蚕蛹蚕粪喂鱼，鱼塘泥肥桑，桑叶又喂蚕。有的是喂猪、种菜、养鱼三结合，用猪粪、塘泥肥菜，菜根菜叶喂鱼、喂猪。所以说水产生产的发展，可以促进农林牧副业的发展；而农林牧副业的发展，也能促进水产生产的发展。我国水源丰富，许多地区的人民公社都有一定的水面。有水就能养鱼，就能进行水产生产。去年许多地区在“向水里索取财富”的口号下，把过去没有利用的浅海、海港、湖泊、河流、水库等都加以整修，进行养殖生产，获得了很大的利益。浙江绍兴县斗门人民公社生产商品鱼三十五万斤，换回了小高炉四十六座，风车十五部，木船八十三只，耕牛三头，肥田粉三万余斤，这对巩固人民公社和扩大再生产起了重要作用。
    我国人民正在向大自然进军。大自然能够给予人们财富的，主要是山地、平原、水域三个方面。我们要增加国家和人民的财富，充分利用大自然的资源来进行社会主义建设，就不仅要向山上山下、地上地下进军，而且也要向水上水下进军。水产战线的根本任务，就是要把水里能生长的有营养价值和经济价值的动植物都发展起来，为改善人民的生活和为社会主义建设事业服务。
    1958年在我国工农业全面大跃进的形势下，水产事业也获得了很大的发展。水产品总产量已从1957年的三百一十二万吨，提高到六百零二万吨，增长将近一倍，等于第一个五年增产累计的二倍。增产的数量和发展的速度都是空前的。但是，必须看到我国的水产事业还是很落后的，还远远不能适应人民生活的需要，必须注意增加这方面的生产。
    能不能保持去年水产大跃进的速度或者以比去年更高的速度来发展我国的水产事业，以满足全国人民的需要呢？我们的回答是肯定的。
    我国有非常丰富的水产资源。全国海岸线长达一万几千公里，有广阔的海洋渔场可供捕捞生产，其中有四十三万方浬的大陆棚更是鱼群集中繁殖回游之所，资源尤为丰富。内陆更是江、河、湖泊及池塘、水库纵横交错，星罗棋布。特别是随着今后农田水利建设的发展，随着农业生产上“三三制”和大地园林化的伟大理想的逐步实现，水面会更加扩大起来，水产事业的发展更是不可限量。目前在海洋方面，我们还有广阔的东南海渔场尚未完全开发，中上层鱼群还没有更有效地打捞；淡水方面，可养殖水面约有一亿亩，去年进行养殖的仅三千万余亩；海水可养殖的面积约一千五百万亩，去年只利用一百五十万亩。而且平均单位产量也很低，鱼类亩产仅一百一十七斤，与已经出现的高产万斤相差八十多倍；贝类平均亩产六百四十斤，与亩产万斤的相比也还相差十五倍；藻类平均亩产也比高产纪录相差好几倍。可见，我国水产潜力是极大的，如果我们把全部可供捕捞与养殖的海、淡水水面都利用起来，并提高单位面积产量，更多更快地发展水产事业，生产足够数量的水产，满足我国人民的需要是完全可能的。
    1958年的实践证明：依靠群众，依靠人民公社，以养殖为主，积极发展捕捞的水产生产方针是正确的。水产可分“养殖”与“捕捞”两个方面。捕捞生产，主要是在辽阔的海洋和江、河、湖泊，利用船网等工具捕捞天然资源；养殖生产，则在全国各地只要有水面的地区，投放一定的苗种就能饲养。两种生产都是必要的，但从发展的方向和方针来说，生产重点应该是放在养殖上，因为养殖潜力更大，且有投资小，收益大，技术简易等优点，能成为全国每个人民公社都可以而且应该去发展的生产事业。经过1958年的大跃进，广大群众在党的领导下，高度发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，也创造了丰富的争取水产大跃进的经验，过去认为不能进行养殖的许多水面，经过整治可以进行养殖了；过去认为不能养殖的许多品种，也都可以进行养殖了；过去认为不能进行人工孵化的许多水产苗种，也都可以人工孵化取得了。这就打破了长期以来水产生产上可养与不可养的水面和品种的界限，为养殖生产开辟了取之不尽用之不竭的来源。特别是密放精养经验的创造，更为大大提高单位水面产量提供了可靠的保证。这一切都雄辩地说明水产事业的前途是极为广阔的。特别重要的是，我们有去年全面大跃进的丰富经验和有了人民公社这样一种无比优越的基层组织，更有了党的八届六中全会关于农林牧副渔全线大革命的伟大号召，这就为全党全民大搞水产事业提供了十分有利的条件，为水产生产的更大跃进提供了十分有利的条件。
    当然，要把可能性变为现实，我们还必须作极大的努力，还应作好一切必要的措施。这些措施主要是：
    第一，大力推广1958年高产经验，推广去年群众创造的几百亩以内的小型水面“试验田”的高产经验，开展大面积高额丰产运动，这是争取当前水产更大丰收的第一个关键。必须把已经掌握的鱼种及其他贝藻苗种，优先投放在比较更有把握的小型水面中去放养，并且切实贯彻“水”（改良水质、增加水深）、“种”（掌握健壮的苗种）、“饵”（饵料充足）、“密”（合理密放密养）、“混”（多品种混合放养）、“轮”（轮放轮捕）、“防”（防治病、虫、敌害）、“管”（专人管理）八字精养法，以提高单位面积产量。
    第二，大搞人工孵化，争取苗种大丰收，这是争取今年水产更大丰收的第二个关键。大搞人工孵化，不仅关系到当前产量，也关系到第二年的产量。为了准备充分数量的苗种，必须采取人工孵化与捕捞并举的方针，并且把主要从捕捞天然苗种转到人工孵化，并推广已经孵化成功的优良品种，使养殖品种多样化。在推行人工孵化时，也要和捕捞天然苗种一样，要大搞群众运动，打破人工孵化的神秘观点，做到社社搞孵化，季季搞孵化，使水产的苗种得到充分的解决。
    第三，积极发展捕捞生产。改进和提高海、淡水捕捞生产，也是水产大发展的关键问题。为了提高捕捞产量，在海洋方面除了巩固黄海、渤海已有渔场阵地，保护和繁殖资源，稳定捕捞产量外，还要在东海南海开辟新的渔场。同时积极推广去年在海洋捕捞方面的成功经验，即实行“找”（找寻渔场）、“改”（改革网具）、“兼”（多种工具兼作业）、“保”（保护资源）、“安”（安全生产）以提高单位船网的产量。在淡水捕捞方面，除了推广已有的行之有效的网具和作业方法外，还必须结合各种水面的特点，学习和运用海洋捕捞的成功经验，改变目前捕捞落后的情况。
    第四，大力开展技术革新运动。目前劳动力紧张是整个农业战线上的普遍现象。要解决劳力不足和任务繁重的矛盾，只有在提高劳动效率方面找出路。按照今年各地分配到水产战线上的劳动力情况来看，无论捕捞或养殖，无论是海水或淡水，都必须大大地提高劳动效率，才能保证水产事业的更大跃进。因此，劳动力必须合理地安排，先进的作业方法必须及时推广，工具改革必须大力进行。各地应该从现在开始，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动。
    在党的总路线和八届六中全会决议的鼓舞下，根据1958年水产大跃进的丰富经验，虽然在争取1959年水产事业的更大跃进的斗争中还有不少困难，但是，在党的正确领导下，只要我们坚定不移地贯彻执行党的群众路线的工作方法，依靠广大群众的冲天干劲，反对保守，破除迷信，大闹技术革命，实干、苦干、巧干，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，我们便一定会在水产战线上获得更大的跃进，完成和超额完成党和国家给予水产战线的光荣任务。
