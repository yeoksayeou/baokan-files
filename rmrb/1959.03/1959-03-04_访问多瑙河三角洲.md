    Visiting the Danube Delta
    By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing

    The Secret of the Delta
    After entering Romanian territory, the Danube River stretches for 1,075 kilometers, crossing the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, traversing the vast plains of the south, and passing through the mounds under the Dobruja Plateau, flowing straight to the Black Sea. However, this river, which has experienced countless disasters, seems to be particularly fond of this beautiful land of Romania. The closer it gets to the Black Sea, the slower it flows, and near Tulcea, it simply divides into three branches to enter the sea. In this forked area, the Danube's countless tributaries meander and encircle, forming a network of waterways. This is the Danube Delta, which has long been regarded as mysterious.
    This 430,000-hectare delta has attracted countless scientists and travelers who come to explore its mysteries and admire its extraordinary natural scenery. We visited this place with the same feeling.
    We boarded a small steamer in the beautiful river port of Tulcea and sailed along the central branch of the Danube. On both sides of the river, the endless reeds looked like a sea of wheat, filling our hearts with joy of harvest. Bare bushes and reddish willow groves also came into view from time to time, still bearing traces of suffering from flood disasters. Occasionally, we could see a piece of farmland and a few reed-covered thatched houses, or a flock of wild birds flying across the snowy sky.
    However, this is not the entire secret of the delta. Many of its secrets have been dispelled by the severe cold or sealed by ice and snow. In the warm season, the delta is a completely different scene, a veritable labyrinth of nature. The endless reeds and continuous ponds make you feel a sense of profound mystery everywhere. You can see white swans and pelicans swimming in the lakes, wild boars flashing through the reed marshes; you can see interesting floating islands moving on the lake; you can hear the chirping of hundreds of birds and the low howls of wolves; you can smell the fragrance of exotic flowers and herbs… All this adds a legendary color to the delta. However, this is not a fairy tale world, but a place that holds real wealth for the Romanian people.
    The Danube Delta, covered with reeds and lakes, is a paradise for birds and waterfowl. It is home to 150 species of birds, making it a meeting place for many migratory birds from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some of these birds are very precious and can only be seen here. More than ten species of animals, such as wild boars, wild cats, wolves, otters, minks, and foxes, also live here. At present, the delta's annual hunting income accounts for 10% of the country's total. The delta's fish are even more diverse, with about 200 species, among which carp, stickleback, and trout are the most delicious. It is estimated that this area can produce more than 26 million kilograms of fish annually. Romanian scientists are conducting systematic research on these birds, animals, and fish, trying to make them reproduce in large numbers and increase more wealth for the country.

    Machine Harvesting of Reeds
    The greatest wealth of the Danube Delta is the inexhaustible reeds.
    After more than an hour of sailing, our steamer docked at Mariuc Island, the center of the reed country. A row of new buildings and spacious workshops have been built on this island, which is the Mariuc Reed Research Experimental Station. We visited Comrade Todoviechu, the head of the station. He first took us to see the machine harvesting of reeds. We put on the leather coats worn by the reed workers, and a tractor in the style of a reviewing car took us to the heart of the reeds in the heavy snow. Large areas of reeds had already been harvested here, and the ground looked particularly empty. The remaining reed roots were neatly arranged, as if a good crop had been harvested here.
    There are four work teams here, using six specially made combine harvesters. The combine harvesters roared towards the dense reeds. The reeds obediently fell under the blades of the harvesters. The machines automatically bundled them into small bundles, and the workers then loaded the bundles of reeds onto another tractor-pulled transport vehicle and transported them to the dock on the banks of the Danube.
    It looks like machine harvesting reeds is as easy as harvesting crops. In fact, it is not. Many reeds grow in swamps or shallow ponds. Once the combine harvester breaks through the ice or frozen soil, it will sink into the mire, and sometimes the entire machine will fall into the mud and cannot be pulled out. The tractor we were riding in also got stuck in the mud twice. The last time, it struggled for nearly half an hour without being able to get out. We had to get off the tractor and carefully step on the ice covered with thin snow to get on another tractor.
    Although the workers here are wearing rubber boots above their knees, mud and ice fragments often get into their boots. They often work in severe cold of minus ten degrees and often fight against blizzards. Although the working conditions here are so difficult, they have not stumped the brave reed workers. Their harvest volume is increasing day by day. The advanced worker Ainaki can harvest an average of 12.5 tons of reeds per day. Once you understand the working conditions here, you can see that this is an amazing figure. This member of the Labor Youth League often lies on the snow to repair his tractor during other people's rest time. Ensuring that the machine does not break down is one of the reasons for his excellent results.
    The workers here are all volunteers who have come here to support this new work. According to the stationmaster, many young people are asking to come to this most difficult place to contribute their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    The World's First Reed City
    After we visited the reed harvesting, the stationmaster returned to his office with us. He told us about the growth of reeds in the Danube Delta and the tasks of their research experimental station.
    The Danube Delta grows 260,000 hectares of reeds, which can harvest at least 2.7 million tons annually. This is the most concentrated reed production area in the world, accounting for one-third of the world's total reed production. Reeds can be used to manufacture various papers, rayon, feed, and other products. Using reeds to make paper, each ton of reeds can replace 1.5 cubic meters of good wood. Each hectare of reeds can produce 300 kilograms of cellulose, but each hectare of forest can only produce 100 kilograms of cellulose per year, and the quality is far inferior to reeds. In the past, Romania rarely used this huge wealth, letting it grow and die year after year, or burning it in a fire. In 1955, the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party raised the issue of how to use the reeds of the Danube Delta.
    This Reed Research Experimental Station was established in 1956 and is the center of reed research in the delta. The staff here are conducting a series of scientific research and experiments on the growth, harvesting, and transportation of reeds.
    What kind of machine can harvest reeds on floating islands? This is a problem to be solved. In addition to fixed islands, there are countless floating islands floating on the lake in the Danube Delta, on which the best quality reeds grow. These floating islands are composed of the interwoven roots of reeds, aquatic plants, and some silt. The thickness of the floating islands ranges from ten centimeters to two meters, and the largest area is 1,000 hectares. The total area of the floating islands is 70,000 hectares. In the event of a storm or rising lake water, some floating islands move elsewhere. Thin floating islands can only bear the weight of one person. Therefore, using machines to harvest reeds on floating islands is a difficult problem. The weight of the machine must be very light, but the "horsepower" must be very large. The research experimental station will build a machine manufacturing workshop dedicated to solving this problem.
    In order to improve the growing conditions of reeds in the Danube Delta, the station has divided the delta into six reed areas. In each area, dikes, waterways, and sluice gates must be built for scientific management to make the reeds grow better. This project is also very arduous. In Area No. 1 alone, it is necessary to build 170 kilometers of dikes and dig 150 kilometers of waterways.
    The stationmaster spread out a construction design drawing and said to us that in a few years, the world's first reed city will appear on Mariuc Island. A large number of workers' residences, large laboratories, machine manufacturing workshops, and power stations will be built here, as well as clubs, libraries, shops, schools, nurseries, and hospitals. The stationmaster, who served as a tank officer in the anti-fascist war, is full of confidence in this brand-new cause.
    In the Danube Delta, not only Mariuc Island uses machines to harvest reeds, but also two other reed areas use machines to harvest. The reed harvesting work in the delta will not end until April. This year, 40% of all harvesting work will be mechanized, and next year it will reach 80%.

    Modern Reed Processing Enterprise
    On the same day we visited the Danube Delta, we also visited a large-scale reed processing joint enterprise that is under construction. This factory is located in Braila, not far from the Danube Delta, and is being built in cooperation with Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic. This is the world's first modern factory using reeds as raw materials. The factory includes four cellulose workshops, a hardboard factory, a common paper factory, a rayon factory, a reed waste utilization workshop, and a workshop for the production of papermaking chemicals.
    The factory began construction in 1956 and will be fully completed in 1968. The raw material transportation of this factory is completely mechanized. It has its own wharf and railway, and the reeds of the delta can be supplied continuously through the Danube. Soon, the hardboard factory, the rayon factory, and the papermaking chemical workshop will be partially put into production. After the factory is fully completed, it will require about 980,000 tons of reeds as raw materials each year. In this way, the reeds of the Danube Delta will no longer rot in vain. (Attached picture)

    访问多瑙河三角洲
    本报记者  魏凌冰
    三角洲的秘密
    多瑙河在进入罗马尼亚境内以后，绵延一千零七十五公里，它跨过喀尔巴阡山麓，越过南方的千里沃野，穿过多布鲁查高原下的土丘，直向黑海流去。但是，这条经历过无数灾难的河流好像特别留恋罗马尼亚这块美丽的国土，它愈接近黑海流得愈慢，在土耳卡附近索性分成三股入海。在这个叉形地区，多瑙河的无数支流回曲环转，形成了一片水网地带，这就是很久以来被人们视为神秘的多瑙河三角洲。
    这个四十三万公顷的三角洲曾吸引了无数科学家和旅行者，前来探究它的奥秘和欣赏它的奇异的自然景色。我们也怀着同样的心情访问了这个地方。
    我们在美丽的河港土耳卡乘上小汽船，沿着中间的一股多瑙河航行。在河的两岸，无边的芦苇好像一片麦海，使人心中不禁泛起丰收的喜悦。光秃的灌木丛和微红的柳林也随时映入眼帘，它们还残留着饱受洪水灾害的痕迹。偶而也可看到一片耕地和几间芦苇盖的茅舍，或者一群野禽飞过飘雪的天空。
    然而，这不是三角洲的全部秘密，它的许多秘密已被严寒驱散或是被冰雪封盖起来了。在温暖的季节，三角洲却完全是另外一幅景象，这里简直是一个大自然的迷宫。无尽的芦苇和连绵的水塘使你感到处处深邃莫测。你可以看到白色的天鹅和鹈鹕在湖中遨游，苇塘中闪现出野猪的身影，你可以看到有趣的浮岛怎样在湖上移动；你可以听到百鸟争鸣和狼的低嗥；你可以闻到奇花异草的芳香……。这一切使三角洲增加了传奇的色彩。然而这不是一个童话世界，这里为罗马尼亚人民蕴藏着真正的财富。
    遍布芦苇和湖泊的多瑙河三角洲是飞鸟和水禽的乐园。这里生活着一百五十种鸟类，成了欧、亚、非三洲许多候鸟的会合地。这些飞鸟中有些是很珍贵的，只有在这里才能看到。这里还生长着野猪、野猫、狼、水獭、水貂、狐狸等十种以上的兽类。现在三角洲每年的狩猎收入占全国的10％。三角洲的鱼类更是多种多样，约有二百种，其中鲤鱼、刺鱼和鳟鱼等最为可口。据估计，这地区每年可产鱼二千六百多万公斤。罗马尼亚的科学家们正在对这些鸟兽和鱼类进行有系统的研究，设法使它们大量繁殖，为国家增加更多的财富。机器收割芦苇
    多瑙河三角洲的最大财富是取之不尽的芦苇。
    经过一个多小时的航行，我们的汽船在芦苇之乡的中心——马留克岛靠岸。这个岛上新建了一排排的楼房和宽敞的车间，这是马留克芦苇研究实验站。我们访问了站长托得维丘同志。他首先带我们去参观机器收割芦苇。我们换上芦苇工人穿的皮大衣，一辆检阅车式的拖拉机冒着大雪把我们送到了芦苇的腹地。这里已有大片大片的芦苇收割完毕，地面显得特别空旷，残留的芦苇的根茎整齐地排列着，好像在这里收割了一片好庄稼。
    这里有四个工作队，他们使用着六台特制的联合收割机。联合收割机吼叫着向茂密的芦苇冲去，芦苇驯服地随着收割机的剪刀应声倒下，机器自动把它们捆成小捆，工人们紧接着把一捆捆的芦苇装上另一辆拖拉机牵引的运输车，运到多瑙河边的码头。
    看起来，机器收割芦苇也像收割庄稼一样容易。其实不然，许多芦苇都生长在泥潭或浅塘里，联合收割机一压破了冰层或冻土就会陷进泥淖，有时整个机器都掉进泥潭中拔不出来。我们乘的一台拖拉机也两次陷进泥坑中，最后一次挣扎近半个小时都不能出来，我们不得不走下拖拉机，小心地踏着薄雪覆盖的冰层走上另一台拖拉机。
    这里的工人们虽然都穿着到膝盖以上的胶靴，但是泥浆和碎冰块也往往灌进靴里。他们经常是在零下十度的严寒中工作，并且常常同暴风雪搏斗。这里的工作条件虽然如此艰苦，然而并没有难住勇敢的芦苇工人。他们的收割量一天天增加，先进工作者艾纳基每天平均可收割十二吨半芦苇，只要你了解到这里的工作条件，你就可以看出这是一个惊人的数字。这位劳动青年联盟盟员，常常是在别人休息的时候躺在雪地上修理自己的拖拉机，保证机器不出故障是他获得优秀成绩的一个原因。
    这里的工人们都是志愿到这里来支援这项新的工作的。据站长说，还有许多青年要求到这个最艰苦的地方来，为祖国的社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
    世界第一座芦苇城
    我们参观过收割芦苇以后，站长同我们一起回到了他的办公室，他向我们谈了多瑙河三角洲芦苇的生长情况和他们这个研究实验站的任务。
    多瑙河三角洲生长着二十六万公顷的芦苇，每年至少可收割二百七十万吨，这是世界上最集中的芦苇产地，产量占世界芦苇总产量三分之一。利用芦苇可以制造各种纸张、人造纤维、饲料和其他产品。用芦苇造纸，每吨芦苇可代替一点五立方公尺的好木材。每公顷芦苇可制三百公斤纤维素，但每公顷树林每年所生产的木材却只能造一百公斤纤维素，而且质量也远远不如芦苇。罗马尼亚过去很少利用这笔巨大财富，年年让它自生自灭，或是一把火把它烧掉。1955年，罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会提出了如何利用多瑙河三角洲芦苇的问题。
    这个芦苇研究实验站是在1956年成立的，它是三角洲的芦苇研究中心。这里的工作人员正在对芦苇的生长、收割和运输进行一系列的科学研究和实验。
    用什么机器能在浮岛上收割芦苇？这是一个有待解决的问题。在多瑙河三角洲上，除去固定的岛屿外还有无数的浮岛漂在湖面上，上面生长着质量最好的芦苇。这些浮岛是由芦苇的交错的根茎、水生植物和一些泥沙构成的。浮岛厚度从十公分到两公尺不等，面积最大的有一千公顷，浮岛的总面积是七万公顷。在遇到风暴或湖水上涨时，有些浮岛就向别处移动。薄的浮岛只能担得起一个人的重量。因此，利用机器在浮岛上收割芦苇是一个难题，机器的重量必须很轻，但“马力”又必须很大。这个研究实验站将建立一个机器制造车间，专门解决这个问题。
    为了改善多瑙河三角洲芦苇的生长条件，这个站已把三角洲划分为六个芦苇区。在每个区中都要筑堤、开河道、修水闸，以便进行科学管理，使芦苇生长得更好。这项工程也是很艰巨的，单是在一号区就需要修一百七十公里的堤坝，挖一百五十公里的河道。
    站长摊开一份建筑设计图对我们说，几年后，在马留克岛上将出现世界上第一座芦苇城。这里将建立大批的工人住宅，大型的实验室、机器制造车间和发电站，还将修建俱乐部、图书馆、商店、学校、托儿所和医院。这位在反法西斯战争中作过坦克军官的站长对这项崭新的事业满怀信心。
    在多瑙河三角洲上，不仅马留克岛使用机器收割芦苇，在另外的两个芦苇区也使用机器收割。三角洲的芦苇收割工作要在4月间才能结束。今年全部收割工作将有40％机械化，明年将达到80％。
    现代化芦苇加工企业
    在访问多瑙河三角洲的同一天，我们还参观了一个正在加紧建设中的规模宏大的芦苇加工联合企业。这个工厂设在离多瑙河三角洲不远的布莱拉，是由罗马尼亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国合作修建的。这是世界上第一座利用芦苇作原料的现代化工厂。这个工厂包括四个纤维素车间、一个硬纸厂、一个普通纸厂、一个人造纤维厂、一个芦苇废物利用车间和一个生产造纸用化学品的车间。
    这个工厂是在1956年开始建立的，将在1968年全部建成。这个厂的原料运输完全是机械化的，它有自己的码头和铁路，三角洲的芦苇可以通过多瑙河源源供应。不久之后，硬纸厂、人造纤维厂和造纸用化学品车间将部分投入生产。在这个工厂全部建成后，每年约需九十八万吨芦苇作原料。这样，多瑙河三角洲的芦苇再不会白白烂掉了。（附图片）
