Leap Forward Again
	Yu Tingzi
    Tea is the most common beverage in the daily life of the Chinese people, and is one of the "seven necessities". It is even more of a necessity in minority areas, where people "cannot live a day without tea." Tea production accounts for a large proportion of agricultural production in the mountainous areas of southern China. In general areas, tea income accounts for about 15%-20% of the total agricultural income, and in key tea-producing areas, it accounts for 60%-70% of agricultural income, hence the saying "tea for half a year's food." From this, it can be seen that tea production is closely related to the lives of the Chinese people. Tea is also one of China's important export commodities, and has always occupied an important position in export commodities. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: With the solution of the grain problem, the proportion of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, hemp, silk, soybeans, oil crops, sugar crops, tea, tobacco, and medicinal materials in the total agricultural production should be gradually increased. We should conscientiously implement the Central Committee's resolution and strive to develop China's tea production faster.
    In the past few years, tea production has developed greatly, especially in 1958, driven by the overall leap forward in agricultural production, the production achievements have been even more remarkable. The total tea output for the year increased by about 27% compared with 1957, and there were 57 counties with a yield of over 100 jin per mu and more than 170 mu of high-yield tea fields with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The expansion of tea garden area also exceeded the total of the past few years. Although great achievements were made in 1958, tea production has not yet passed the test, and has not surpassed the highest annual output before the war. In order to make this year's tea production have a greater leap forward, we should continue to exert our efforts, liberate our minds, and conscientiously promote the high-yield experience of 1958. From now on, all tea-producing areas must properly solve the labor arrangement and technological innovation issues in tea production. Past experience has proved that the universal organization of tea professional teams in key tea areas is an important measure to ensure tea production. Especially the labor force during the busy tea season, it is more necessary to make unified scheduling and reasonable arrangements early, so that tea can be picked and manufactured in time, so as to avoid unnecessary losses. The fundamental way to overcome the shortage of labor is to launch a mass movement of technological innovation in tea picking and tea making to improve labor productivity. In 1958, various places had many creations and inventions in tea making tools and tea picking technology innovation. The advanced tools and advanced experiences created by various places should be identified and promoted, and a greater technological innovation movement should be launched to lay a technical foundation for the mechanization of China's tea production process.
    Developing new tea gardens is an arduous and important task in tea production. Now that spring has arrived, it is the season for tea tree cutting and seedling cultivation. The agricultural leadership departments and people's communes in tea-producing areas should seize the opportunity, organize forces, and prepare for the expansion of new tea gardens.
    The battle for an overall leap forward in agricultural production has been enthusiastically launched in the vast rural areas. The tea production front should also, like the grain production front, strengthen the management of spring tea, conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, do a good job in topdressing and frost prevention, ensure a bumper harvest of spring tea, and strive for a greater leap forward in tea production this year.

    跃进再跃进

    茶叶是我国人民日常生活中最普遍的饮料，“开门七件事”，茶叶就是其中之一；在少数民族地区更是生活的必需品。这些地区的人们“不可一日无茶”。茶叶在我国南方山区农业生产中所占比重很大，一般地区茶叶收入约占整个农业收入的15％—20％，重点茶区更占到农业收入的60％—70％，所谓“茶叶半年粮”。由比可以看出，茶叶生产和我国人民生活有着十分密切的关系。茶叶又是我国重要出口物资之一，在出口物资中一向占居重要地位。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中曾经指出：随着粮食问题的解决，应当逐步提高棉、麻、蚕丝、大豆、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟叶、药材等工业原料作物在全部农业生产当中所占的比重。我们应该认真贯彻中央决议，力争更快地发展我国的茶叶生产。
    几年来，茶叶生产有了很大的发展，特别是1958年在农业生产全面大跃进的形势推动下，生产成绩更为显著。全年产茶量比1957年增产了27％左右，并出现了五十七个亩产百斤县和一百七十多亩亩产千斤以上的丰产茶田，茶园面积的扩大也超过了过去几年的总和。1958年虽然取得了巨大成绩，但是茶叶生产还没有过关，没有过战前最高年产量的关。为了使今年的茶叶生产有一个更大的跃进，我们应该继续鼓足干劲，解放思想，认真推广1958年的丰产经验。各产茶区从现在起就要妥善解决茶叶生产中的劳力安排问题、技术革新问题。过去经验证明，重点茶区普遍组织茶叶专业队，是保证茶叶生产的一个重要措施。特别是茶忙季节的劳动力，更需要早作统一调度和合理安排，这样才能使茶叶及时采摘，及时制造，避免造成不应有的损失。克服劳力不足的根本办法，是大搞群众性的采茶制茶技术革新运动，提高劳动生产效率。1958年制茶工具和采茶技术革新方面各地都有许多创造发明。各地所创造的先进工具和先进经验，应当加以鉴定和推广，掀起一个更大的技术革新运动，为我国茶叶生产过程机械化打下技术基础。
    发展新茶园是茶叶生产中的一项艰巨而重要的工作，现在春季已到，正是茶树扦插育苗季节，产茶地区的农业领导部门和人民公社，应该抓紧时机，组织力量，作好增辟新茶园的准备工作。
    农业生产全面大跃进的战斗已经在广大农村热烈展开，茶叶生产战线也应该像粮食战线一样，加强对春茶的管理，认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，作好追肥防冻工作，保证春茶大丰收，力争今年茶叶生产的更大跃进。
