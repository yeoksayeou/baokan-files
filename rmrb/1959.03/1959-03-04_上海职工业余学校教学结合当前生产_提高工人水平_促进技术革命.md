Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd. More than 2,900 vocational spare-time schools in Shanghai factories have played a significant role in promoting technological revolution and improving labor productivity in the past six months.

Most of these vocational spare-time schools were established after August and September last year. Due to the combination of theory and practice in teaching, and flexible and diverse organizational forms, workers' technical levels can be rapidly improved after participating in learning. The Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which had particularly tight production tasks last year, used spare-time schools to train a large number of "new recruits" on the steel front. They organized various skill training classes according to production needs and workers' technical levels, invited veteran workers to serve as teachers, taught classes at the furnace, and taught basic theoretical courses at the same time. In this way, by combining practice and lectures, the No. 1 furnace group of the first converter workshop trained 24 second and third assistants in less than half a month; in four months, they also trained five furnace chiefs, while in the past, training a furnace chief took at least two years. Shanghai No. 2 Automobile Transportation Company adopted the method of simultaneous long-term and short-term training, and also trained 428 reserve drivers and 70 secondary drivers in half a year.

Many small and medium-sized factories have simple production equipment and most have no engineers, so they often encounter difficulties in production. Their spare-time schools use this as the content of technical courses, with veteran workers giving lectures and organizing everyone to discuss and study, solving many key problems in production. The Minfeng Alloy Copper Wire Factory, which has only 76 employees, in the process of trial-producing the technically complex new product, New Constantan wire, first had six master craftsmen lecture on the six processes they were most familiar with, respectively. After listening to the lectures, the workers discussed, revised, and supplemented them, and then systematically compiled them and asked relevant research units to verify and appraise them. In this way, the new product was successfully trial-produced, and developed from small-batch trial production to large-scale production. The main product of the Qigong Chemical Plant, "nickel sulfate," has a complex production process. Technicians once wanted to improve it, but one link, namely the problem of removing zinc from nickel compounds, could not be solved. Once, when this technician was lecturing at a spare-time school, he mentioned this problem and talked about his suggestions for improvement. After listening to this, the workers were inspired and actively participated in the research. Finally, the research was successful, changing the entire production process from eight processes to one, shortening the production time from nineteen days to two days, and greatly improving the quantity and quality of production.

The cultural and basic knowledge courses set up by various spare-time schools have also directly promoted the development of the technological revolution because they are closely related to production. Last year, after reading the language lesson "Producing Industrial Glasses in a More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Way," the workers of Shanghai No. 1 Glasses Factory were greatly encouraged and immediately launched a technological innovation campaign, proposing more than 100 technological innovation measures in the first semester, which basically realized the semi-mechanization of the entire factory.

Some factories that manufacture large or high-end products have successfully trial-produced many new products by organizing workers to conduct scientific and technological research through spare-time schools. The Shanghai Tool Factory's spare-time school organized a total of 117 scientific research groups. In the past six months, they have successively proposed 1,033 research projects. In the process of learning, researching, and producing, they have successively completed 306 research projects, including high-end product projects that have been completed, such as high-efficiency tapered shank oil-jet twist drills and small saw blades for the instrument industry. The Tongren Alloy Factory, which once conducted a friendly competition with the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, had its employees successfully trial-produce 30 kinds of high-end alloys and solved several major technical equipment problems in products through scientific research activities in the first semester.

    上海职工业余学校教学结合当前生产
    提高工人水平　促进技术革命
    新华社上海3日电　上海各工厂举办的二千九百多所职工业余学校，半年来对推动技术革命，提高劳动生产率起了很大作用。
    这些职工业余学校大多数是在去年8、9月以后创办的，由于教学中理论和实际结合，组织形式灵活多样，工人们参加学习后，技术水平能够迅速地提高。去年生产任务特别紧张的上钢三厂，就利用业余学校培养了大批钢铁战线上的
  “新兵”。他们根据生产的需要和工人的技术水平，举办各种技工培训班，请老工人担任教师，在炉边上课，同时讲授基本理论课程。就这样边实习，边听课，第一转炉车间一号炉小组不到半个月就培养了二十四个二助手和三助手；四个月中还培养了五个炉长，而过去培养一个炉长至少要两年。上海市汽车运输二场采取长期和短期训练同时进行的办法，在半年内也培养出了预备驾驶员四百二十八人，二级驾驶员七十人。
    许多中小型工厂，生产设备简陋，大都没有工程师，在生产中经常遇到一些困难。他们的业余学校就以此作为技术课的内容，由老工人讲课，组织大家讨论研究，解决了许多生产中的关键问题。只有七十六个职工的民丰合金铜丝厂，在试制技术复杂的新产品新康铜丝过程中，先由六个老师傅分别讲授各人最熟悉的六道工序，工人听讲后进行讨论修整补充，然后系统整理出来，请有关研究单位核实鉴定。就这样，新产品试制成功了，并由小批试制发展到了大批生产。勤工化学厂的主要产品“硫酸镍”，生产过程很复杂，技术人员曾想加以改进，但是有一个环节，即在镍化物中除锌的问题不能解决。有一次，这位技术人员在业余学校讲课时，提到了这个问题，并且讲了他的改进意见。工人们听后，受到启发，就积极参加研究。最后，这项研究成功了，把整个生产过程八道工序改成了一道，生产时间从十九天缩短到两天，产量质量大为提高。
    各业余学校所设的文化基础知识课程，也因为紧密地联系生产，有的已直接促进了技术革命的开展。上海眼镜一厂的工人去年读到语文课“多快好省地生产工业眼镜”后，受到很大鼓舞，立即展开技术革新运动，在上学期提出了一百多项技术革新措施，使全厂基本上实现了半机械化。
    有些制造大型产品或高级产品的工厂，通过业余学校，组织工人进行科学技术研究，试制成功了许多新产品。上海工具厂业余学校组织的科学研究小组共有一百一十七个，半年来，他们先后提出研究项目一千零三十三项，在边学习、边研究、边生产中，已先后完成三百零六个研究项目，其中已完成的高级产品项目有高效率的锥柄喷油麻花钻头、仪表工业用的小锯片等。曾和中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所进行友谊竞赛的铜仁合金厂，职工们在上学期通过科学研究活动，试制成功了三十种高级合金，并且解决了好几项产品中的重大技术设备问题。（附图片）
