(Reported by our newspaper) The work of soaking seeds, sowing, and cultivating seedlings of early rice in the southern provinces is rapidly unfolding from south to north. In the Lingnan area, where the season is earlier, over 80% of the early rice sowing has been completed. Now the seedlings are a lush green, growing vigorously. The first batch of early-sown seeds and experimental fields have begun transplanting. Guangdong Province has transplanted over 1.3 million mu, of which Hainan Island accounts for 1.03 million mu. In the southern parts of provinces and regions such as Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan, many counties and cities have also started transplanting activities. In the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, seed soaking became universal in mid-March, and from late March, they will enter the busy stage of sowing.

This year's preparations for early rice production started early and were tightly grasped, especially in material preparation, which is more sufficient than any previous year. According to statistics from nine provinces including Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu for early rice can be increased by one to two times compared to last year, generally reaching 30,000 to 50,000 jin per mu. The quality of the fertilizer is generally better. When planting early rice last year, there was no local chemical fertilizer. This year, each province has local chemical fertilizer plants. According to incomplete statistics from seven major early rice producing areas such as Jiangsu and Anhui, over 145 billion jin of local chemical fertilizer have been produced, a large part of which will be used for early rice. Green manure is also more abundant than last year. The area of green manure in thirteen southern provinces and cities is about 65 million mu, an increase of more than 2 million mu over last year. Currently, green manure is growing very well. The 5 million mu of green manure planted in Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, is expected to yield at least 6,000 jin of fresh grass per mu, an increase of about 100% compared to last year. Deep plowing of early rice fields has been universally carried out. Generally, fields can be plowed to a depth of six to eight cun, and high-yield fields are plowed to a depth of about one chi. All paddy fields in Hunan Province, except those planted with winter crops, have been plowed, with 11.14 million mu plowed to a depth of six to eight cun, 8.83 million mu to a depth of eight cun to one chi, and 11.02 million mu to a depth of more than one chi. Early rice seeds are generally retained in sufficient quantities, ranging from 40 to 60 jin per mu. In some areas, such as Xiaogan County, 80 jin of seeds are retained per mu. The mass seed selection work has also been done better than in previous years. Early rice seeds in provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian have generally undergone winnowing, screening, mud or salt water selection, and seed treatment, and the quality of seeds has been significantly improved. In Chengnan Commune, Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, the purity of seeds after selection increased from 90% to 98%. This year, various provinces have also transferred over 120 million jin of early-maturing japonica rice seeds, which have now been promptly distributed to the production teams for timely sowing.

In order to do a good job in early rice production and win a bumper harvest, various provinces have paid special attention to early rice seedling cultivation, adopting the advanced wet nursery method. Professional seedling protection teams have been formed in most areas. Wuhu Prefecture in Anhui Province has organized more than 15,000 nursery management teams, totaling 114,000 people, and prepared a large number of straw curtains, windbreaks, and other cold protection equipment. In Liuyang County, Hunan Province, 2,582 out of 3,787 production teams have built seedling protection sheds in the fields, camping out on the land to protect the seedlings, and 2,815 teams have prepared nursery covering materials. Anren County has launched a mass seedling protection movement. In just a few days, 6,158 mu of sown nurseries have been covered with 310,000 dan of various insulation fertilizers, and measures such as burning fire to smoke, watering seedlings with warm water, and building windbreaks have been taken. There are also "weather observation teams" and "cold prevention shock teams." Baise Prefecture in Guangxi universally conducted nursery inspection and evaluation, and field consultations. Yulin Prefecture implemented a five-guarantee responsibility system: guarantee no death or rot, guarantee fertilization, guarantee strong growth, guarantee no insect pests, and guarantee no harm from birds and animals. In Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, a mass debate was launched among the masses and cadres on how to cultivate strong seedlings and prevent seedling rot. Currently, 400,000 laborers are carefully managing the nurseries, determined to be good "nursery nannies," striving for "no rotten seedlings per mu, and strong seedlings from every plant." After a mass debate, Nanchong Prefecture in Sichuan Province proposed many solutions to the shortage of nurseries: (1) appropriately increase the amount of seeds sown in nurseries, (2) cultivate seedlings in stages and transplant seedlings in batches, (3) increase the water storage capacity of ponds and rice paddies, and vacate winter water fields for nurseries, (4) select fertile sandy soil to cultivate dry seedlings, and (5) adjust nurseries at the commune level.

In order to reduce the labor burden, ensure timely cultivation, and improve quality, many areas have properly arranged labor and paid attention to tool reform. Mianyang Prefecture in Sichuan Province has transferred more than 360,000 laborers from logistics personnel and sideline production to strengthen the front line, increasing the number of people directly engaged in agricultural production to more than 2.53 million. In order to ensure a strong and vigorous agricultural front, the Fuzhongying Jiawuxing Commune in Guangxi reasonably adjusted labor, streamlined some logistics personnel, and made great progress in the commune's production work. Originally, the sowing work was progressing very slowly, only 13.1% was completed by March 6. After increasing a large number of laborers, it was basically completed by the 8th. The progress of tool reform is also very rapid. Changde Prefecture in Hunan Province is carrying out a movement of boat and raft modernization in the lake area, vehicle modernization on the plains, and cableway modernization in the mountainous areas amidst the current tense fertilizer transportation. Currently, in Changde and Hanshou counties, an average of one vehicle is available for every two fertilizer accumulation laborers, making the fertilizer delivery work fast, good, and smooth. In order to reduce the labor burden of dense planting and transplanting this year and transplant seedlings on time and with quality, various provinces are rushing to manufacture rice transplanters. Anhui Province plans to manufacture 290,000 rice transplanters before transplanting. Gannnan Prefecture in Jiangxi Province has manufactured more than 17,000 rice transplanters, and counties such as Ji'an, Duchang, Yongxiu, Jinxian, and Anyi are also actively manufacturing them. The "Boyang No. 1" rice transplanter manufactured in Boyang County has low cost and high efficiency, costing only 19 yuan per unit, and one person can transplant six to eight mu per day. The county plans to complete the manufacturing of 20,000 units before early rice transplanting, so that more than 90% of the paddy fields can use rice transplanters. (Attached photo)

    要早稻超小麦　让南北全丰收
    南方各省早稻大面积丰产运动即将进入高潮
    岭南地区开始插秧，长江流域普遍浸种播种
    本报讯　南方各省早稻的浸种、播种育秧工作正由南而北迅速的展开。季节较早的岭南地区，早稻播种已经完成80％以上，现在秧苗一片油绿，生长茁壮。第一批早播的种子和试验田，已经开始插秧。广东省已插秧一百三十多万亩，其中海南岛区占一百零三万亩。福建、广西、云南等省、区的南部，也有不少县市开始了插秧的活动。长江流域各省，3月中旬即普遍浸种，从3月下旬起，将进入播种大忙阶段。
    今年早稻生产准备工作，动手早、抓得紧，特别是在物质准备上比以往任何一年都较充分。早稻的肥料，据广东、江西、广西、湖南、四川等九个省的统计，每亩施肥量可比去年增加一到两倍，一般每亩有肥三到五万斤。肥料的质量，一般都比较好。去年种早稻的时候，还没有土化肥，今年各省都有土化肥厂，据江苏、安徽等七个早稻主要产区不完全统计，已生产土化肥有一千四百五十多亿斤，很大一部分要用在早稻上。绿肥也比去年多，南方十三个省市的绿肥面积为六千五百万亩左右，比去年增加二百多万亩。目前绿肥生长很好，今年湖南省常德专区种植的五百多万亩绿肥，预计每亩鲜草产量至少可达六千斤以上，比去年增产一倍左右。早稻本田的深翻工作，已经普遍进行，一般田都能耕深六寸到八寸，丰产田耕深一尺左右。湖南省所有水田，除种有冬作物的以外，已全部耕完，计六到八寸的有一千一百一十四万亩，八寸到一尺的八百八十三万亩，一尺以上的有一千一百零二万亩。早稻种子，一般都留得比较充足，每亩在四十斤到六十斤。部分地区如孝感县，每亩留种达八十斤。群众性的种子精选工作，也做得比往年好，浙江、广东、广西、福建等省早稻种子，一般都经过风选、筛选、泥水或盐水选种及种子处理工作，种子质量都有显著提高；浙江省绍兴县城南公社经过精选的种子，纯度由90％提高到98％。今年各省还调拨了一亿二千多万斤早熟粳稻种子，现在都已及时分发到各生产队，按时播种。
    为了抓好早稻生产，赢得早稻大丰收，各省都特别重视早稻育秧工作，采用先进的湿润秧田育秧法。护秧专业队伍，大部地区都已组成。安徽省芜湖专区组织了一万五千多个秧田管理小组，共十一万四千多人，并准备了大量草帘、防风障等防寒设备。湖南省浏阳县三千七百八十七个生产队，已有二千五百八十二个在田间盖了护秧棚，地头扎营，保护秧苗，有二千八百一十五个队准备好了秧田复盖物。安仁全县开展了群众性的护秧运动，只几天，已将播种的六千一百五十八亩秧田，加盖了各种保温肥三十一万多担，还采取了烧火熏烟、温水淋苗、搭防风棚等措施；还有“看天小组”、“防寒突击队”等。广西的百色专区，普遍进行了秧田检查评比，田头会诊。玉林专区实行了包不死不烂、包施肥、包育壮、包无虫害、包无鸟兽害等五包责任制度。浙江省嘉兴专区，已在群众和干部中，开展了如何培育壮秧、不烂秧的大鸣大放大辩论，目前四十万劳动大军，正精心管理秧田，决心当好“秧保姆”，力争“亩亩不烂秧，株株出壮秧”。四川省南充专区经过群众性的大辩论后，提出了很多解决秧田不足的办法：（一）适当增加秧田播种量，（二）分期育秧，分批栽秧，（三）增加塘和囤水田的储水量，把冬水田腾出来做秧田，（四）选择肥沃带沙的土地育旱秧，（五）以公社为单位，调剂秧田。
    为了减轻劳力负担，做到耕作适时，提高质量，不少地区都妥善安排了劳力，并注意了工具改革工作。四川省绵阳专区已从后勤人员和搞副业生产等方面，抽调了三十六万多劳力增强第一线，使原来直接搞农业生产的增加到二百五十三万多人。广西富钟英家五星公社为了保证农业战线兵强马壮，合理的调整了劳力，精简了一部分后勤人员，全社生产工作有了很大的进展。原来播种工作进展很慢，3月6日才完成13.1％，增加大批劳力后，到8日止已基本播完。工具改革的进展也很快。湖南省常德专区在目前紧张的运肥当中，开展了湖区船排化、平原陆地车子化、山区索道化运动。现常德、汉寿两县的积肥劳力，平均每两个人就有一部车子，使送肥工作既快又好地顺利进行。为了减轻今年密植插秧的劳力负担，按时按质插好秧苗，各省都在赶制插秧机。安徽省计划在插秧前制好二十九万部插秧机。江西省赣南区已制好插秧机一万七千多部，吉安、都昌、永修、进贤、安义等县也在积极赶制。波阳县制成的“波阳一号”插秧机，成本低工效高，每台只需十九元，一人一天能插六到八亩。全县计划在早稻插秧前，完成制造二万部，使90％以上水田用上插秧机。（附图片）
