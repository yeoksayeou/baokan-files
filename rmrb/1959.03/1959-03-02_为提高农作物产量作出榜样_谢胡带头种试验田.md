Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 28th – To set an example for increasing crop yields, Albanian Council of Ministers Chairman and Labor Party Politburo Member Shehu is personally leading the planting of experimental fields within a state-owned farm.

Shehu began his first day of agricultural work on the afternoon of the 26th. He personally drove a tractor to cultivate the land. On the experimental field, which covers a total area of seven hectares, Shehu plans to plow deeply to a depth of eighty to one hundred centimeters, and to plant corn, cotton, and forage crops using twenty-seven different methods. At the same time, he also plans to try various organic and chemical fertilizers, as well as irrigation. In order to obtain higher yields, Shehu has prepared to use spot planting for corn and transplanting cotton seedlings.

After the first day of labor, Shehu cordially discussed farming experiences with tractor drivers and the state farm director. He suggested that farm comrades prepare a logbook for each experimental field, recording in detail the agricultural operations procedures and crop growth conditions, in order to serve as material for future summaries. Currently, leaders of the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture and local party secretaries are also planting experimental fields.

    为提高农作物产量作出榜样
    谢胡带头种试验田
    新华社地拉那28日电  阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席、劳动党政治局委员谢胡亲自在国营农场内带头种试验田，为提高农作物产量作出榜样。
    谢胡在26日下午开始了第一天的农事操作。他亲自驾驶拖拉机耕耘土地。在总面积达七公顷的试验田上，谢胡准备深耕八十至一百公分，并以二十七种不同的方法来种植玉米、棉花、饲料作物等。同时，他还准备试用各种有机肥料和化学肥料以及水利灌溉。为了获得更高的产量，谢胡已准备在种植玉米和棉花时，将分别采取点种和栽种棉苗的方法。
    谢胡在第一天劳动后，亲切地同拖拉机手们、国营农场场长等座谈了耕作的经验。他建议农场同志要为每一块试验田准备一本工作日志，按农事操作的程序和农作物生长情况，详细加以记载，以便作为今后总结的资料。目前，阿尔巴尼亚农业部的领导人和地方党委书记等也都在种试验田。
