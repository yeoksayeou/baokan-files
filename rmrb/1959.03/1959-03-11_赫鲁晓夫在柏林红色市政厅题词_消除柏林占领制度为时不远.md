Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 10th: Khrushchev said during a visit to Berlin's Red City Hall on the morning of the 9th: "Capitalism now has more and more contradictions. It will be replaced by communism, and the future belongs to communism." Khrushchev also inscribed in the City Hall's guest book: "I am convinced that all the people of Berlin will be liberated from the remnants of the occupation system and will be able to devote their strength to the peaceful development of the city's economy and culture. That day is not far away."
