A proposal by all the representatives of the National Small Blast Furnace Conference:
Strive for a Large-Scale Bumper Harvest of Small Blast Furnaces

We, all the representatives attending the National Small Blast Furnace Production Technology Conference, have come to the people's capital - Beijing from 27 provinces and cities across the country, and we feel extremely excited. This conference analyzed the current production situation of small blast furnaces across the country, exchanged experiences, studied measures, and launched a socialist competition for high yield and high quality.

In the great leap forward of doubling steel production last year, we all participated in the surging mass iron smelting movement. In just a few months, thousands of small blast furnaces were built across the country, a large number of technical forces were cultivated, and rich production experience was accumulated. Great achievements have been made. This year, the Party and the state have put forward new combat tasks for us. We are determined to continue to go all out, aim high, and strive to complete the task of 18 million tons of steel.

From a national perspective, large, medium-sized, and small blast furnaces undertake almost the same amount of tasks in iron smelting production. Therefore, striving for a large-scale bumper harvest of small blast furnaces is the main key to improving steel production. To this end, all of our representatives unanimously propose that all small blast furnace workers across the country immediately take action to put all small blast furnaces that can be put into production into production, and focus on iron smelting, vigorously grasp raw material work, stabilize the operation of small blast furnaces, pass the technical and quality barriers, improve the utilization coefficient, and strive for high yield, high quality, and a large-scale bumper harvest.

After a heated discussion, all of our representatives put forward the following competition conditions as our common goals.

(1) Ensure the production of small blast furnaces, achieve a large-scale bumper harvest of high yield and high quality, organize a major competition of the start-up rate between provinces and between furnace groups, and strive to reach a furnace opening rate of 80%-90% in April.

(2) Carry out a technical revolution movement and strive for the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces to gradually move towards the goal of producing more than 1.0 ton of iron per cubic meter.

(3) Resolutely break through the quality barrier of pig iron, strictly carry out production in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated provisional standards for pig iron from small blast furnaces, and strive for a pig iron qualification rate of more than 95%.

(4) Vigorously save coke and reduce costs. Starting from April, reduce the coke consumption per ton of iron to below 1,600 kilograms, and gradually move towards the goal of 1,200 kilograms. Strive to reduce the cost of pig iron to around 200 yuan within half a year.

(5) Resolutely implement the spirit of the "nation as a single chessboard," prioritize external needs over internal ones, and prioritize key areas over general ones, to ensure the completion of the task of transferring pig iron externally with quality, quantity, and on time, to support steelmaking and heavy machinery manufacturing industries.

(6) Conscientiously learn from advanced experiences, resolutely implement the resolutions of the Small Blast Furnace Conference, and rapidly popularize all successful experiences to all furnace groups across the country.

In order to achieve this goal, we propose the following measures as a common action plan:

1. Rationally adjust the layout, do a good job in "two transformations and five determinations," implement key allocations, and transfer blast furnaces and blowers with poor conditions to places with better conditions for production.

2. Through the overhaul of small blast furnaces, improve the furnace type structure, implement construction key points, and create good conditions for high yield, high quality, and long life of blast furnaces.

3. Vigorously grasp raw material work, grasp the construction of Red Flag coking ovens, and effectively improve the quality of coke, requiring the ash content of coke not to exceed 15% to 20%, and the sulfur content not to exceed 1% to 1.5%. And take effective measures to strengthen mining and ore dressing work, and strive for the grade of ore entering the furnace to reach more than 40%.

4. Immediately promote key advanced experiences such as increasing the amount of blast air, multi-nozzle combustion in tubular hot blast stoves, and reducing raw material particle size, mixing raw materials evenly, and grading raw materials into the furnace.

5. Refer to the Small Blast Furnace Operation Points adopted by the conference, formulate operating procedures, strictly implement them, and unify and improve the level of operation.

6. Establish operation plans and scheduling work, grasp the daily output level; improve labor organization, and strengthen the work of the foreman level.

We believe that under the leadership of the Party, our small blast furnace workers across the country will surely be able to make the production of small blast furnaces across the country leap forward again in the shortest time, and achieve greater victories in ensuring the completion of the great task of 18 million tons of steel.

    全国小高炉会议全体代表倡议
    争取小高炉大面积丰收
    我们出席全国小高炉的生产技术会议的全体代表，从全国二十七个省市来到人民首都——北京，感到极大的兴奋。这次会议分析了全国小高炉当前的生产情况，交流了经验，研究了措施，并掀起了高产优质的社会主义竞赛。
    在去年钢产量翻一番的大跃进中，我们都参加了汹涌澎湃的全民炼铁运动。在短短的几个月中，全国建成了成千上万座的小高炉，培养了大批的技术力量，积累了丰富的生产经验。取得了巨大的成绩。今年党和国家向我们提出了新的战斗任务，我们决心继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成1800万吨钢而奋斗。
    从全国范围来说，在炼铁生产方面大、中型高炉和小型高炉几乎担负着同等数量的任务，因此，争取小高炉的大面积丰收，乃是提高炼钢生产的主要关键。为此，我们全体代表，一致倡议：要求全国小高炉工作者，立即行动起来，把一切可以投入生产的小高炉全部投入生产，并以炼铁为中心，大抓原料工作，稳定小高炉的操作，过好技术关和质量关，提高利用系数，争取高产优质和大面积丰收。
    我们全体代表经过热烈讨论以后，特提出如下的竞赛条件，作为我们共同的奋斗目标。
    （1）保证小高炉的生产，取得高产优质大面积丰收，组织省与省之间、炉群与炉群之间的开工率大竞赛，争取4月份达到开炉率80％—90％。
    （2）开展技术革命运动，争取小高炉的平均利用系数，每一立方公尺逐渐向生产1.0吨铁以上的目标前进。
    （3）坚决突破生铁质量关，严格按照部颁小高炉生铁暂行标准进行生产，生铁合格率争取达到95％以上。
    （4）大力节约焦炭，降低成本。从4月份起把每吨铁的焦炭消耗量降到一千六百公斤以下，并逐渐向一千二百公斤的目标前进。争取在半年内把生铁成本降到二百元左右。
    （5）坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的精神，先外后内，先重点后一般，保证按质、按量、按时地完成外调生铁任务，支援炼钢和重型机械制造工业。
    （6）认真学习先进经验，坚决贯彻小高炉会议的决议，迅速把一切成功的经验，普及到全国所有的炉群。
    为了实现这个奋斗目标，我们提出以下的措施作为共同的行动计划：
    1、合理调整布点，做好两化五定工作，实行重点配备，把条件不好的高炉和风机调到有条件的地方去生产。
    2、通过小高炉大修，改进炉型结构，贯彻施工要点，为高炉的高产优质长寿创造好的条件。
    3、大抓原料工作，抓红旗焦炉的建设，切实改进焦炭质量，要求焦炭灰分不超过15％至20％，硫分不超过1％至1.5％。并采取有效措施加强采矿和选矿工作，争取入炉矿石品位达到40％以上。
    4、立即推广鼓足风量，管式热风炉多咀燃烧，以及缩小原料粒度，原料混匀和分级入炉等关键性先进经验。
    5、参照大会通过的小高炉操作要点，制订操作规程，严格贯彻，统一并提高操作水平。
    6、建立作业计划与调度工作，抓日产水平；改进劳动组织，并加强工长一级的工作。
    我们相信在党的领导下，我们全国小高炉工作者一定能够在最短时间内使全国小高炉的生产跃进再跃进，在确保完成1800万吨钢的伟大任务中，取得更大的胜利。
