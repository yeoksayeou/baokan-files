    The best way to improve labor productivity is through overall planning and rational allocation of labor. After the rational allocation of labor, further tap into the potential of labor.
    Perhaps some people will say, we've been tapping potential every year, how much potential is left to tap this year? We say: the potential is great. The Harbin Power Machinery Manufacturing Plant tapped into labor potential last year, and this year, without increasing equipment or personnel, they completed the first quarter's plan twenty-five and a half days ahead of schedule, with an average of one person doing the work of three throughout the factory. Isn't this clear proof of great potential?
    Tapping labor potential does not mean extending working hours or increasing labor intensity. We must start by leveraging the wisdom of the masses to carry out technical revolution and tap into latent strengths. Manual labor always requires much more labor than semi-mechanization, and old-fashioned belt-driven machinery is far less efficient than new-style electric machinery. If everyone takes action and continuously reforms production tools, then production efficiency can increase by one or two times, or even dozens or hundreds of times.

    一人多顶几人
    提高劳动生产率最好的办法，是统筹规划，合理安排劳动力，在劳动力合理安排以后，进一步大挖劳动潜力。
    也许有人说，年年挖潜力，今年还有多少潜力可挖哩？我们说：潜力是很大的。哈尔滨动力机械制造厂去年挖过劳动潜力，今年在不增加设备不增加人的情况下，又提前二十五天半完成第一季度计划，全厂总平均一人顶三个人。这不是潜力很大的明证吗？
    挖掘劳动潜力，绝不是意味着延长工时和增加劳动强度。必须从发挥群众智慧大搞技术革命着手挖掘潜在力量。手工劳动比起半机械化所占的劳动力总是多得多，旧式的皮带机械比起新式的电动机械生产效率也差得很远，如果人人动手，在生产工具上不断给以改革，那末，生产效率就可一倍两倍以至几十几百倍的增长。
