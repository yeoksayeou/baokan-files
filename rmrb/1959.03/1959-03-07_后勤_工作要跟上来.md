	Logistics Work Must Keep Up

	Production and life have always been inseparable. Without good production, living standards cannot be improved; without good living standards, people's enthusiasm for production cannot be further mobilized.

	Now, the great spring plowing production movement is about to begin. How to further improve welfare work while focusing on production, so that everyone on the production front is healthy and full of energy to fight the first battle well, is of great importance for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

	"An army's provisions must precede its advance." Although this is experience from military struggle, it is also applicable to production struggle. The Jiaohe County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is doing the right thing by strengthening leadership over welfare work and actively supporting the "Ten Members" competition movement.

    “后勤”工作要跟上来
    生产和生活从来是分不开的。不搞好生产，生活就不能改善；不搞好生活，也就不能进一步调动人们的生产积极性。
    现在，春耕生产大运动即将开始，在抓生产的同时，如何进一步做好生活福利工作，使生产前线的人个个身体健康、干劲十足地打好第一仗，对于实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进有着重大的关系。
    “兵马未动，粮草先行。”这虽然是军事斗争中的经验，但也适用于生产斗争。中共蛟河县委对福利工作加强领导，对“十员”竞赛运动积极支持，这种做法十分正确。
