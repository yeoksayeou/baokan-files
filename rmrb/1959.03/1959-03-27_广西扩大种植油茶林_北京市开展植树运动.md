Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 26th: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region’s oil-tea camellia forests expanded to 8,720,000 mu last year, with 3,000,000 mu bearing fruit, producing a total of 400,000 dan of oil. In order to accelerate the realization of the lignification of oil crops and the landscaping of the land, the entire autonomous region has newly planted 5,750,000 mu of oil-tea camellia forests in this spring's tree planting campaign. This area is nearly double the total area of oil-tea camellia forests in the entire autonomous region before liberation.

    Under the requirements of universal planting and focused development, the leading organs of the autonomous region have designated 19 counties including Rong'an, Longsheng, and Mubi as oil-tea camellia bases, requiring these counties to have an average of two to three mu of oil-tea camellia forest per person by 1960.

    In order to achieve a bumper harvest of tea oil this year, the people of the entire region, while vigorously building oil-tea camellia forests, have also universally strengthened the tending of existing oil-tea camellia forests. Many regions have organized professional teams to ensure that tea plants have fertilizer when hungry, water when thirsty, medicine when sick, and complete elimination of pests when they attack. As early as last winter, Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County launched oil-tea camellia tending work, with more than 20,000 people in the county tending oil-tea camellias every day.

    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Beijing’s spring tree-planting campaign has been launched on a large scale. As of the 24th, hundreds of thousands of workers, students, cadres, residents, PLA officers and soldiers, and Young Pioneers have newly planted more than 1,900,000 trees such as poplar, willow, and locust trees on vacant land in organs, troops, schools, and along streets. The city has already afforested more than 25,000 mu.

    Industrial and mining areas and suburban areas are the focus of this year's tree planting and afforestation. Many factories and workers' residential areas have large-scale plans for afforestation and greening this year. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company alone plans to plant 200,000 trees. Many suburban people's communes have established afforestation professional teams to carry out large-scale tree planting and afforestation. Cadres from central and Beijing organs have also organized afforestation teams to help suburban people's communes with afforestation.

    Large-scale planting of fruit trees and construction of other economic forests are one of the characteristics of Beijing's greening and afforestation this year. Peach, pear, and apple trees have been planted along the sides of the more than 40-li long avenue outside Dongzhimen. Many fruit trees have also been newly planted in parks such as Zhongshan Park and Taoranting Park this year.

    广西扩大种植油茶林
    北京市开展植树运动
    据新华社南宁26日电　广西僮族自治区去年油茶林发展到八百七十二万亩，其中开花结果的有三百万亩，共产油四十万担。为了加速实现油料作物木本化和大地园林化，在今春植树造林运动中，全自治区又新植造了五百七十五万亩油茶林，这个面积比解放前全自治区油茶林总面积增加将近一倍。
    在普遍种植、重点发展的要求下，自治区领导机关划定了融安、龙胜、睦边等十九个县作为油茶基地，要求这些县在1960年按人口平均每人要有二至三亩油茶林。
    为了今年茶油大丰收，全区人民在大造油茶林同时，对现有油茶林也普遍加强了抚育工作。许多地区组织了专业队，保证茶饥有肥、茶渴有水、茶病有药，害虫来袭，彻底消灭。三江侗族自治县早在去年冬天就展开了油茶抚育工作，全县每天都有两万多人抚育油茶。
    据新华社26日讯　北京市春季植树造林运动，已经大规模展开。到24日为止，成千上万的工人、学生、干部、居民、解放军官兵和少先队员们，在机关、部队、学校的空地上和街道两旁，新栽了杨、柳、槐树等一百九十多万株，全市已经造林二万五千多亩。
    工矿区和郊区是今年植树造林的重点。许多工厂和工人住宅区今年造林绿化的规划都很大，仅石景山钢铁公司就计划植树二十万株。许多郊区人民公社都建立了造林专业队大规模地进行植树造林。中央和北京市的机关干部还组织了造林队伍，帮助郊区人民公社造林。
    大量栽种果树和营造其他经济林木，是今年北京绿化造林的特点之一。东直门外长达四十多里的大道两旁，今年都栽上了桃树、梨树和苹果树等。中山公园和陶然亭等公园里，今年也新种上许多果木。
