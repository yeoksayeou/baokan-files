North Vietnam's rice production last year far exceeded that of South Vietnam. North Vietnam had a bumper harvest last year, with an average of 321 kilograms of rice per person. South Vietnam, which has always been known as the rice bowl of Vietnam, planted 500,000 hectares more rice than North Vietnam last year, but only harvested 3,191,000 tons of rice, with an average of only 255 jin of rice per person based on population.
