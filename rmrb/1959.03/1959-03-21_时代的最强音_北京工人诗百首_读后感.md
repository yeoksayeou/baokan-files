    The Strongest Voice of the Era
    ——Reflections on "One Hundred Poems by Beijing Workers"
    Wan Qing
    After reading "One Hundred Poems by Beijing Workers," edited and published by Beijing Publishing House, one can feel the beating red heart of the working class and hear the resounding language like that of a hammer striking iron. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are the strongest voice of the era.

    The hands of workers can create miracles, and they can also create poems. The collection brings together the songs of workers from various posts, expressing the thoughts, feelings, and wisdom of the working class. Perhaps, if we examine each poem individually, we may find that some are slightly rough, but as a whole, this collection is like a string of shining pearls. This proves that workers' poetry has the newest and most beautiful artistic style and is worthy of our attention and learning.

    The spirit of workers' poetry is magnificent. For example, after reading this poem: "Fearing neither heaven nor earth, the working class dares to speak, each word weighs a thousand catties, each sentence changes the world." (Gao Changfu), one feels that it is with this spirit that workers create the world and create poetry. Looking again at this poem by Hao Laibao of the Shijingshan Power Plant: "The Earth turns for ten thousand years, never stopping for a moment, we compare ourselves to it, to see who turns more joyfully… If you ask us when we will stop, we will turn even if the Earth doesn't." What a spirit! Only those who grasp machines and reverse the universe with their own hands can utter such heroic words.

    Another important characteristic of workers' poetry is its simplicity; its thoughts and language are healthy, clear, and approachable. It is simple but not dry, beautiful but not ostentatious. Like "The Factory Director Visits My Home" (Su Shi), it narrates the process and mood of an old worker receiving a visit from the factory director in a very approachable way, vividly and realistically reflecting the new relationship between the factory director and the workers, full of strong poetic flavor. The opening section of the poem: "Magpies chirp, the door creaks, surely there will be guests today, but I never expected – the factory director visits my home." In just a few sentences, the environment, the event, and the characters' thoughts and activities are all explained. The last section: "Seeing the guest off at the entrance of the alley, my heart is moved to tears, I have been a worker for thirty years, and I have never seen – workers and factory directors become friends." The theme and emotion of the whole poem are conveyed through the old worker's feelings. Other poems, like Cao Yongyuan's "Words of the Old Inspector," also express abundant poetic meaning through simple narration.

    Workers' poetry has rich images and language, and fresh poetic conceptions. In He Yuesuo's "The Sound of Music in the Workshop," the image of "A golden dragon rolls from under the hammer, red scales falling all over the ground…" is used to describe iron forging, which beautifies and poeticizes the labor. This image does not come from thin air, nor is it the result of carving, but is truly felt and created by the workers themselves from their labor. The last section of the poem: "The hammer falls, the sound shakes the sky, each hammer is a revolutionary note, each hammer is a bright and splendid sunrise," elevates this ordinary labor to a solemn realm, filled with the pride of the laborers.

    Many poems have ingenious conceptions and are full of poetic sentiment. For example, Shen Yufan's "Dedicated to the Capital": "Saving steel pipes in five years, to circle Beijing once; saving copper wire in five years, to circle Beijing twice – this is, the three golden chains we dedicate to the glorious capital." The poem is very simple, only six lines, and the subject matter is also very ordinary, writing about saving materials, but the author has developed rich imagination and association. This poetic conception can only be conceived by workers who personally participate in labor.

    时代的最强音
    ——“北京工人诗百首”读后感
    宛青
    读了北京出版社编辑出版的“北京工人诗百首”，使人从这本书里感觉得到工人阶级跳动的红心，听得到如铁锤打铁般铿锵的语言。说它们是时代的最强音，是不过分的。
    工人的双手能创造奇迹，也能创作诗篇。诗集里汇合了各个不同岗位工人的歌声，表现了工人阶级的思想感情和智慧。也许，逐首推敲起来会发现有的诗还略嫌粗糙，但整个看来，这本集子仍像一串闪光的珠串，这证明工人的诗是具有最新最美的艺术风格，是值得我们重视和学习的。
    工人诗歌的气魄是雄伟的。比如读了这首诗：“天不怕，地不怕，工人阶级敢说话，一字出口重千斤，一句出口变天下。”（高长福）感到工人就是凭着这种气概创造世界，也创造着诗。再看石景山发电厂郝来宝的这首诗：“地球万年转，一刻不停闲，我们和他比，看谁转得欢。……要问我们何时停，地球不转我们转。”何等样的气魄！只有双手掌握机器、扭转乾坤的人，才能说得出这样的豪言壮语。
    工人的诗另一重要特色是淳朴；思想语言健康明朗、平易近人，它朴素而不枯涩，华美而不浮夸。像“厂长串门到我家”（苏适）这首，十分平易近人地叙述了一个老工人接待厂长来串门的过程和心情，生动而真实地反映了厂长和工人的新的关系，充满了浓厚的诗意。诗的开头一节：“喜鹊吱吱喳喳，门儿支支呀呀，想必今天有客人，可真没想到——厂长串门到我家。”几句就把环境、事情、人物思想活动都交代出来了。最后一节：“送客送到胡同口，心里感动泪直流，俺工人当了三十年，没见过——工人、厂长交朋友。”通过老工人的感情把全诗的主题思想和情绪都传达出来了。其他像曹永源的“老检验员的话”也同样地通过朴素的叙述表达了充沛的诗意。
    工人的诗里有丰美的形象和语言，有新鲜的诗意的构思。在何玉锁的“车间里的乐声”里，用“一条金龙锤下滚，赤鳞片片落地上……”来形容打铁，这就把劳动加以美化和诗化了。这个形象不是凭空得来，也不是雕琢所致，而是真正热爱劳动的工人自己，从劳动中感受和创作出来的。诗的最后一节：“铁锤落，震天响，一锤是一个革命的音符，一锤是一片灿烂的朝阳。”更使这平凡的劳动升高到庄严的境界，充满了劳动者的自豪感。
    许多诗的构思是巧妙的，充满诗情的。如沈育藩的“献给首都”：“五年内节省钢管，绕北京一圈；五年内节省铜线，绕北京两圈——这就是，我们给光荣的首都献上的三个金链。”诗很简单，只有六行，题材也很平常，写的是节约材料，但作者却发挥了丰富的想像和联想。这种诗意的构思只有亲身参与劳动的工人才能想得到。
