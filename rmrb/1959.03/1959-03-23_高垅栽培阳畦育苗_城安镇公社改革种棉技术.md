    High Ridge Cultivation and Solar Greenhouse Seedling Raising
    Chengan Town Commune Reforms Cotton Planting Technology
    (By our newspaper) The Chengan Town People's Commune in Ci County, Hebei Province, has launched a high tide of major reforms in cotton planting systems. The core of the reform is to vigorously promote high ridge cultivation and solar greenhouse seedling raising methods to solve the problems of ventilation and light penetration under dense planting conditions and to promote early maturity of cotton.
    This year, the Chengan Town People's Commune plans to plant 100,000 mu of cotton, with a planned average yield of seed cotton more than doubling or tripling last year's yield. Among them, five 10,000-mu large-area high-yield demonstration plots are planned to have an average yield of 1,000 jin of lint cotton per mu. The commune party committee has universally convened symposiums of agricultural technicians to conduct a serious analysis of the cotton production increases over the years. In the past, cotton was sown around April 5th every year, and the flowering period coincided with the rainy season. In addition, most of the cotton fields were located on lower-lying terrain, which was prone to water accumulation, leading to reduced cotton production. Therefore, this year it was decided to adopt high ridge cultivation and solar greenhouse heating seedling transplanting methods, and to sow one month earlier. Currently, competition for red flags is underway among various management areas, production teams, and commune members.

    高垅栽培阳畦育苗
    城安镇公社改革种棉技术
    本报讯　河北磁县城安镇人民公社，掀起了种棉耕作制度大改革的高潮。改革中心是大搞高垅栽培和阳畦育苗法，以解决在密植情况下的通风透光和促使棉花早熟问题。
    城安镇人民公社今年要种十万亩棉花，计划平均亩产籽棉比去年提高一倍多到二倍。其中五万亩五个大面积高额丰产方，计划平均亩产皮棉一千斤。公社党委普遍召开农业技术干部座谈会，对历年来棉花增产的情况作了认真的分析。过去，每年播种棉花都在4月5日左右，开花期正是雨季，加之，大部分棉田地势较低，容易积水，使棉花减产。因此今年决定采用高垅栽培和阳畦加温育苗移苗法，并提前一个月播种。目前，各管理区、生产队和社员之间开展了夺红旗的竞赛。
