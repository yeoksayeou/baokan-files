Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, March 7th: After listening to the live recording of the "National Coal Mine Workers Red Flag Competition" broadcast on the 2nd, Kailuan Coal Mine workers immediately plunged into the competition and revised their leap forward plans one after another. From the 1st to the 4th, the average daily output of the entire mine reached 44,218 tons, an increase of 16.64% compared with the same period in February.

    Having completed the production tasks for January and February in a balanced and comprehensive manner, the workers of Tangjiazhuang Mine immediately held Red Flag competition evaluation meetings in more than 600 teams after listening to the broadcast, summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward in January and February, and proposing to ensure the comprehensive over-fulfillment of the first quarter's tasks on a daily and ten-day basis. The workers in the Sixth Mining Area, who had not completed the coal production task in February, also put forward the fighting slogan of "Turning low yield into high yield and resolutely planting the red flag." After implementing the method of using coal cutting machines to cut back and forth in thin coal seams, the daily output on the 3rd increased from the usual 600 tons to 710 tons. After hearing the broadcast, the workers of Zone 64 of Zhaogezhuang Mine immediately held group meetings to study ways to increase production. The next day, the coal mining efficiency of the teams of Han Guangjin, Guo Shenglin, and Li Chen all increased by 20%, and they received the competition red flag. The workers of another shift mined 1,935 tons of coal more than the previous day.

    The tunneling workers, who are advancing simultaneously with the coal miners, proposed: We must be pioneers in large-scale bumper harvests! The Weihai Fast Tunneling Team, which completed the first quarter's task 28 days ahead of schedule, repeatedly studied measures after listening to the broadcast and proposed to ensure that another 1,500 meters would be tunneled by the end of March. On the 4th, one shift tunneled 28 meters, more than double the original plan. The workers in Tangshan Mine who are developing seventeen working faces immediately launched a Red Flag competition after listening to the broadcast. On the 3rd, each face exceeded the plan by 50% to 130%.

    In order to supply a large amount of coking coal urgently needed by steel bases such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, the workers of the Linxi Mine Coal Washing Plant held mobilization meetings in shifts and groups after listening to the broadcast. They guaranteed that on the basis of completing the February task ahead of schedule, they would forge ahead more courageously, complete the first quarter's plan ten days ahead of schedule, and increase the output by 37% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shuangyashan, March 7th: The workers of Shuangyashan Lingsi Coal Mine, who have continuously over-fulfilled the production plans for January and February, are participating in the National Coal Mine Workers Red Flag Competition with practical actions of high yield and high quality. Since the beginning of March, this coal mine has over-fulfilled its daily plan every day. As of March 4th, this mine had mined 125,000 tons of coal more than planned.

    The workers of Lingsi Coal Mine are determined to take another leap forward this year and increase the output of the first quarter by 84.5% compared with the actual output of the same period last year.

    The main measures for Lingsi Coal Mine to ensure high yield and bumper harvest are: on the basis of completing the daily work plan, each pit organizes a high-yield day every three to five days depending on the situation. The output on this day should exceed the plan by 500 to 600 tons, and one pit can increase production by 4,000 to 5,000 tons of coal in a month. Lingsi Coal Mine has also formulated a system to ensure high production quality. For example, the "three picking" system requires coal miners, chute watchers, and cart pushers to be responsible for picking stones underground; the "four no's" system prohibits stones from going on chutes, coal carts, trains, and shovels. Now, in this mine, "everyone picks stones, and everyone values coal quality" has become a common practice, regardless of whether they are coal miners or tunneling workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 7th: After the "National Coal Mine Workers Red Flag Competition" broadcast, the workers of Huainan Coal Mine launched a magnificent new upsurge of production competition. Since the 2nd, the daily output of the entire mine has risen to more than 30,000 tons. The average daily output from March 1st to 4th increased by 15.4% compared with the average daily output in February.

    After the broadcast, Huainan mines adopted various forms to launch large-scale publicity, large-scale inspections, large-scale competitions, and large-scale reforms. The workers expressed their determination to guarantee the completion of the coal mining plan every month and to exceed it every quarter.

    At present, there is an endless stream of teams, shifts, and individuals breaking quotas and creating new records in various mines. On the day of the broadcast, the workers of Xiejiaji No. 2 Mine produced 5,181 tons of coal, creating the latest daily production record this year. On the 4th, the workers of Datong Coal Mine held a heroic challenge and also created the highest daily production record this year. In the past few days, 58 people in Xinzhuangzi Mine have exceeded the original quota by ten times, and five shifts have exceeded the quota by about five times. (Photo attached)

    举起煤矿大面积丰产红旗
    开滦、双鸭山、淮南生产竞赛形成新高潮
    新华社唐山7日电　开滦煤矿职工在2日收听了“全国煤炭职工红旗竞赛”广播大会实况录音以后，立即投入了这一竞赛，纷纷修订跃进计划。1日至4日全矿日产量平均达到四万四千二百一十八吨，比二月份同期提高了16.64％。
    已经均衡地全面地完成一、二月份生产任务的唐家庄矿职工，听了广播后，全矿六百多个小组，都马上召开红旗竞赛评比会议，总结一、二月份大跃进的经验，提出要保证按日、按旬地全面超额完成首季任务。没有完成2月份产煤任务的第六采煤区职工，也提出：“低产变高产，坚决插红旗”的战斗口号，他们在薄煤层实行了割煤机来回割的办法后，3日的日产由平时的六百吨提高到七百一十吨。赵各庄矿六四区的职工在听到广播的当天晚上，就开小组会研究增产办法，第二天，韩广金、郭胜林、李臣三个小组的采煤效率都提高了20％，得到了竞赛红旗。另一个班的职工，这一天比前一天多采煤一千九百三十五吨。
    和采煤工人同时并进的掘进工人们提出：一定作大面积丰产的开路先锋！提前二十八天完成首季任务的威海快速掘进队，听了广播后，反复研究措施，提出保证到3月底再多掘进一千五百公尺，4日，有一班就掘进了二十八公尺，超过原计划一倍。唐山矿开拓十七个掌子的职工，听了广播后，立即展开了红旗竞赛，3日各掌都突破计划50％到130％。
    为了大量供应鞍钢、武钢等钢铁基地急需的精煤，林西矿洗煤厂职工在收听了广播后，分班分组开誓师会，他们保证在提前完成2月份任务的基础上，更加奋勇前进，提前十天完成第一季度计划，比去年同期产量提高37％。
    新华社双鸭山7日电　1、2月份连续超额完成生产计划的双鸭山岭西煤矿职工，正以高产高质的实际行动参加全国煤矿职工红旗竞赛。进入3月以来，这个煤矿每天都超额完成日计划。到3月4日为止，这个矿已经比计划多采了十二万五千吨煤。
    岭西煤矿的职工今年决心比去年再跃进一步，把第一季度的产量，比去年同期的实际产量提高84.5％。
    岭西煤矿保证高产丰收的主要措施是：在完成每天作业计划的基础上，各坑口根据情况每隔三、五天组织一次高产日，这一天的产量要超过计划五、六百吨，一个月一个坑口就可以增产四、五千吨煤。岭西煤矿还制订了保证高产质量的制度。例如，采煤工、看溜子工、推车工在井下都有拣?石的责任的“三拣”制度；不许?石上溜子、上煤车、上火车、上铁锹的“四不上”制度等。现在，这个矿里，不管采煤工人或是掘进工人，“人人拣?石，个个重煤质”已经形成了一种风气。
    新华社合肥7日电　淮南煤矿职工在“全国煤炭职工红旗竞赛”广播大会后，掀起了一个波澜壮阔的生产竞赛新高潮。从2日开始，全矿日产量已经上升到三万吨以上，3月1日至4日的平均日产量比2月份平均日产量提高15.4％。
    淮南各矿在广播大会后采取各种形式，展开大宣传、大检查、大竞赛和大改革。职工们纷纷表示坚决保证采煤计划月月完成，季季超过。
    目前，各矿突破定额、创造新纪录的队、班和个人层出不穷。谢家集二矿职工，在广播大会当天就出煤五千一百八十一吨，创造了今年日产最新纪录。4日，大通煤矿职工大摆英雄擂台，也创造了今年日产最高纪录。新庄孜矿在最近几天中，已有五十八个人突破原定额十倍，五个班突破定额五倍左右。（附图片）
