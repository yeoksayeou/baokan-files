Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 26th: In a speech delivered in Damascus on March 22nd, United Arab Republic President Nasser, when discussing the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel during the Suez Canal incident, actually stated: "In those days, we were fighting alone. No country came to help us. We did not receive any indication from any foreign country, including the Soviet Union, that they would provide assistance. We relied on Allah and ourselves. Through this means, we were able to liberate ourselves and defeat the tripartite aggression." In his speech, he repeatedly emphasized: "In every stage of our struggle, we have always relied on ourselves, in addition to relying on Allah. Under no circumstances do we rely on foreign countries."

However, just the month before, on February 21st, Nasser, in a speech delivered in Cairo celebrating the first anniversary of the UAR's establishment, stated that he would not accept "the imperialist bloc's provocation of the relationship between the Soviet Union and the UAR." He said: "We respect the Soviet Union and the Soviet people because they help us with economic construction and industrialization. When we faced economic blockade and economic warfare, the Soviet Union stood with us. The Soviet people supported us in our difficult days."

On May 14, 1958, when Nasser visited the Soviet Union, he also said: "At the critical moment when we resisted the aggression of the imperialist countries, the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship and assistance to us. The Soviet Union stood on our side; in the United Nations and in various international conferences, the Soviet Union supported us. When our people in Port Said were subjected to aggression, the Soviet Union defended us."

In his speech in Damascus, Nasser also talked about the revolution that took place in Iraq last July. Disregarding the facts, he surprisingly said, "After returning from the Soviet Union, I repeatedly said that I am completely sure that we are the only country standing with Iraq."

In this speech, Nasser also falsely accused the Iraqi government of colluding with "Communist agents" and British imperialism to oppose Arab nationalism.

After Nasser's speech, Cairo Radio and some newspapers in Damascus also repeated Nasser's arguments, making every effort to spread propaganda denying the Soviet Union's support and assistance to the UAR.

### 纳赛尔发表演说不顾事实  竟抹煞苏联对阿联的援助

    纳赛尔发表演说不顾事实
    竟抹煞苏联对阿联的援助
    新华社26日讯　大马士革消息：阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔22日在大马士革发表的演说中，在谈到苏伊士运河事件英、法、以色列三国对埃及发动侵略战争的时候，竟然说：“在这些日子中，我们一直是单独作战的。没有任何国家来帮助我们。我们并没有得到任何外国、包括苏联在内要给予援助的任何表示。我们依靠了真主和我们自己。通过这种办法，我们得以解放我们自己，战胜三国侵略。”他在演说中还反复地强调说：“在我们斗争的各个阶段，我们一向是除了依靠真主以外，便依靠我们自己。在任何情况下，我们都不依靠外国。”
    但是，就在前一个月，2月21日那天，纳赛尔在开罗庆祝阿联成立一周年时发表的演说中，还表示不接受“帝国主义集团对苏联和阿联的关系的挑拨”。他说：“我们尊敬苏联和苏联人民，因为他们帮助我们进行经济建设，帮助我们进行工业化建设。当我们面临经济封锁和经济战的时候，苏联曾经同我们站在一起。苏联人民在我们困难的日子里支持了我们。”
    1958年5月14日纳赛尔在苏联访问的时候也曾经说过：“在我们反抗帝国主义国家侵略的严重关头，苏联向我们伸出了友谊和援助的手。苏联站在我们这一面；在联合国、在各种国际会议上，苏联都支持我们。当我国人民在塞得港遭到侵略的时候，苏联维护们我”。
    纳赛尔在大马士革发表的这次演说中还谈到去年7月伊拉克发生的革命，他还不顾事实地竟然说，
  “我从苏联回来以后一再说过，我完全肯定，我们是站在伊拉克方面的唯一国家”。
    纳赛尔在这篇演说中还诬蔑伊拉克政府同“共产党代理人”和英帝国主义“协议”，联合起来反对阿拉伯民族主义。
    在纳赛尔发表演说后，开罗电台和大马士革的一些报纸也重复着纳赛尔的论调，竭力散布否定苏联支持和援助阿联的宣传。
