Everyone Go See "Beside the March 8th River"
Ge Chaohai

"Beside the March 8th River" is a relatively good documentary art film.

One bright spring morning, many guests came to the "March 8th" People's Commune, including agricultural labor models Long Donghua, Yang Guizhi, Guan Fuying, actors Zhang Ruifang, Yan Fengying, and female singer Yin Guanglan. They all enthusiastically asked the female commune leader and labor model Chen Shuzhen to talk about her own situation. However, Chen Shuzhen humbly asked film actress Zhang Ruifang to play her, introducing her own growth process and the establishment of the commune to the audience through the screen.

When I saw this novel treatment, I immediately thought of another film, "Huang Baomei," released last year. Coincidentally, one is on the industrial front, and the other is on the agricultural front. They are like a pair of sister flowers, both women heroes in our country's socialist construction. Putting such advanced figures on the screen is itself an encouraging thing.

From mutual aid teams to people's communes, from Chen Shuzhen, an ordinary rural woman, growing into an outstanding fighter of the Party, what a complex process this is! However, the screenwriter (Lu Yanzhou) and director (Huang Zumo) compressed such a complex process into one hour and forty minutes, forming an epitome of China's agricultural cooperativization movement. They also adopted a sketch technique to depict the growth process of the "March 8th" People's Commune, showing the correctness of the Party's agricultural socialist transformation policy. The process of agricultural socialist transformation is also the process of our heroic figures' growth.

The film consistently runs through a red line of class struggle. For example, Chen Shuzhen, under the inspiration and help of township instructor Yang Defeng, formed a mutual aid team with women and households lacking labor. Many people did not believe that "this bunch of women" could accomplish anything. They were subjected to contempt and discrimination. When they pooled money to buy a cow, the rich peasant Chen Guangfu came to play the trick of swindling money, which resulted in internal disputes and almost destroyed the mutual aid team. As the mutual aid team developed into an agricultural cooperative, the struggle continued. From the township branch's meeting on production and disaster relief, the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy, the sale of surplus grain, the merging of cooperatives, the establishment of advanced cooperatives, all the way to the socialist debate, there was a struggle between the two lines represented by Chen Shuzhen and Zhou Xialu at almost every critical juncture. Through the struggle, the basic contradictions in agricultural socialist transformation were reflected, thereby vividly revealing the profound significance of the agricultural cooperativization movement.

The characterizations in the film are also relatively successful. For example, each member of the mutual aid team led by Chen Shuzhen has a common characteristic, that is, the soaring enthusiasm and the communist style of daring to think, daring to do, and striving for the upstream, as demonstrated in the process of planting seven times after seven floods, fighting for land with water, and fighting for grain with the sky. At the same time, the personality of each member is expressed differently. Chen Shuzhen's spirit and temperament of humility, courage, selflessness, and indomitable spirit are also expressed very profoundly, making the audience feel that she is indeed a model worthy of learning from. Therefore, the film not only correctly expounds the development of China's agricultural cooperativization movement through the typical example of the "March 8th" People's Commune, but also portrays the growth of rural women in our country under the education of the Party. It reflects that the liberated Chinese rural women are playing an increasingly greater role in socialist construction, and their social status is rapidly improving. The film's close integration of the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the growth of rural women for description has special practical significance.

Of course, the film also has some shortcomings. For example, Zhou Xialu, an old Party member from a poor peasant background, degenerated from a commune leader and township branch committee member into a person who shouted along with landlords and rich peasants and attacked the Party. The Party and the masses patiently educated and helped him, but did he finally change like Liu Jiemei? Or did he remain obsessed and anti-Party to the end? This point is not clearly explained. Also, for the image of Chen Chunmao, the film successfully portrayed his loyal and honest side, but the depiction of his weakness and fear of his wife is somewhat overly exaggerated and unnecessary.

Today is March 8th International Women's Day, let everyone go and see this film that sings praises of the glorious image of women in our country in the cause of socialist construction! (Attached picture)

    大家去看“三八河边”
    葛超海
    “三八河边”是一部较好的纪录性艺术片。
    在一个春光明媚的早晨，“三八”人民公社来了许多客人，有农业劳动模范龙冬花、杨桂枝、管福英，演员张瑞芳、严凤英，女歌手殷光兰等。她们都热情地要求女社长、劳动模范陈淑贞讲一讲她自己的情况。陈淑贞却谦虚地请电影演员张瑞芳扮演她，把自己成长的过程和公社成立的经过通过银幕介绍给观众。
    当我看到这种新颖的处理手法时，我立刻联想到了去年放映的另一部影片“黄宝妹”。巧得很，一个在工业战线上，一个在农业战线上，她们俩像一对姊妹花，同是我们国家社会主义建设中的妇女英雄。把这样一些先进人物搬上银幕，本身就是一件令人鼓舞的事情。
    从互助组到人民公社，从陈淑贞这样一个普通的农村妇女成长为党的出色战士，这中间经历着多么复杂的过程呵！但是，编剧（鲁彦周）和导演（黄祖模）却把这样一个复杂的过程，脉络相通地压缩在一小时又四十分钟之内，构成了我国农业合作化运动的一个缩影。并且采用了素描的手法，绘出了“三八”人民公社成长的过程，显示了党的农业社会主义改造政策的正确性，农业社会主义改造的过程也就是我们的英雄人物成长的过程。
    影片自始至终贯串着一条阶级斗争的红线。譬如，陈淑贞在乡指导员杨德丰的启发和帮助下把妇女和缺劳力户组成了一个互助组。很多人都不相信“这窝女人”能干出个什么名堂来。她们受到轻视和歧视。她们凑钱买牛，富农陈光福就来耍骗钱的鬼把戏，结果引起组内纠纷，差一点把互助组搞垮了。互助组发展成农业合作社，斗争仍在继续着。从乡支部召开的生产救灾会议、贯彻统购统销政策、卖余粮、并社、成立高级社，一直到社会主义大辩论，差不多在每一个紧要关头都有着由陈淑贞和周夏路所代表的两条路线的斗争。通过斗争，反映了农业社会主义改造中的基本矛盾，从而生动地揭示出农业合作化运动的深刻意义。
    影片中人物形象的刻划也是比较成功的。譬如，陈淑贞领导的互助组的每个成员，她们都有着一个共同的特点，那就是在七淹七种的过程中所表现出的与水争地、与天争粮的冲天干劲和敢想、敢干、力争上游的共产主义风格。但同时每个成员的性格又表现得各不相同。陈淑贞那种谦逊、勇敢、舍己为人、百折不挠的精神和气质，也表现得非常深刻，使观众感到她确是值得学习的典范。因此，影片不仅通过“三八”人民公社这个典型正确地阐述了我国农业合作化运动的发展，而且刻划出了在党的教育下我国农村妇女的成长。它反映了解放后的中国农村妇女，在社会主义建设中正在一天比一天发挥着更大的作用，社会地位在迅速提高。影片把农业合作化运动的发展和农村妇女们的成长密切结合起来加以描写，是有着特别现实的意义的。
    当然，影片也有些不足之处。譬如，周夏路这个贫农出身的老党员，由社长、乡支部委员蜕化成为跟着地主富农喊叫、向党进攻的人。党和群众耐心地对他进行了教育和帮助，但是，最后他像刘介梅那样地转变过来了呢？还是执迷不悟、反党到底呢？这一点，没有交代清楚。又如，对陈春茂这个形象，成功地刻划了他的忠厚、朴实的一面，但对他的软弱、怕老婆的描绘，却有些过分渲染之处，是没有必要的。
    今天三八节，大家都去看一下这部歌颂我国妇女在社会主义建设事业中的光辉形象的影片吧！（附图片）
