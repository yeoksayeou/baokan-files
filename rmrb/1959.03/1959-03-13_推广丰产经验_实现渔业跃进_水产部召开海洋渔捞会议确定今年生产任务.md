Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 12th: The Ministry of Aquatic Products held a National State-Owned Enterprise Marine Fishing Work Conference in Qingdao. The conference summarized the achievements of the great leap forward in marine fishing by state-owned aquatic enterprises last year, exchanged technical experiences, determined this year's production tasks, and decided to organize employees of state-owned aquatic enterprises to achieve a greater leap forward in fishing production.

Last year, the marine fishing departments of state-owned enterprises greatly strengthened the Party's political and ideological work on the basis of rectification. They mobilized the masses to launch a production competition movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. During the fishing season, the crew members worked hard day and night, seizing every minute, treating the ocean as a battlefield and the fishing nets as weapons, diligently going to sea, casting more nets, and catching more fish. As a result, state-owned enterprises achieved significant results in fishing production last year, with a 31.6% increase in fish catch compared to 1957, exceeding the national plan by 5.61%. In addition, state-owned marine fishing production departments also combined production with actively exploring and expanding new fishing grounds. Many departments carried out diverse operations, adding new varieties such as amberjack, mahi-mahi, and dolphins. At the same time, employees of state-owned marine fishing production departments also launched a technical revolution movement centered on improving fishing gear and operation methods. All of these not only promoted the great leap forward in production last year but also laid the foundation for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

China has a coastline of over 12,000 kilometers. Located in the temperate zone with abundant bait, it is a good place for various fish to gather and grow. The fish production is extremely rich, with more than 1,500 species. In recent years, although China's marine fishing industry has developed greatly, some fishing grounds still have great potential, and many vast fishing grounds have not yet been developed. Some sea areas and some species, especially upper and middle-layer fish, are underutilized or hardly utilized. Based on this situation, the conference determined the task of achieving a greater leap forward in the fishing production of state-owned aquatic enterprises this year. It also emphasized achieving large-scale abundant harvests, ensuring that more than 20% of the operating fishing vessels can meet the requirements of abundant harvest vessels.

The conference summarized the "five-character" experience of "find, protect, diversify, improve, and secure" in marine fishing production based on the laws of marine fishing production and the practice of the great leap forward over the past year. The conference believes that although the marine fishing tasks of state-owned enterprises this year are relatively heavy, as long as we continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, earnestly adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, and correctly implement this "five-character" experience, this year's tasks can be guaranteed to be completed and overfulfilled. "Find" means to find fishing grounds, find resources, and tap the potential of the ocean. This year, all production fishing vessels of state-owned fishing enterprises must undertake investigation tasks in conjunction with production and truly achieve "everyone producing, jointly finding fish." "Protect" means to protect resources and breed resources. Resolutely refrain from producing in closed fishing areas, and if schools of juvenile fish are found during operations, fishing grounds should be shifted to avoid overfishing. "Diversify" means to engage in both fishing and crop rotation and to carry out diversified operations. "Improve" means to reform fishing vessel and net tools, improve operation methods, and further increase labor productivity. "Secure" means that production must ensure safety.

This conference started on February 23 and ended on March 4.

### 推广丰产经验  实现渔业跃进  水产部召开海洋渔捞会议确定今年生产任务

    推广丰产经验  实现渔业跃进
    水产部召开海洋渔捞会议确定今年生产任务
    新华社青岛12日电　水产部在青岛召开全国国营企业海洋渔捞工作会议，总结了去年国营水产企业海洋渔捞大跃进的成绩，交流了技术经验，确定了今年的生产任务，决定组织国营水产企业职工实现渔捞生产的更大跃进。
    去年，各国营企业海洋渔捞部门在整风的基础上，大大地加强了党的政治思想工作，发动群众开展了学先进、赶先进、比先进的生产竞赛运动，船员们在渔汛期间昼夜苦战，分秒必争，以海洋当战场，以船网当刀枪，勤出海，多下网，多捕鱼。这样，就使去年国营企业的渔捞生产获得了重大的成绩，捕鱼量比1957年增长了31.6％，超额5.61％完成了国家计划。此外，各国营海洋渔捞生产部门还结合生产，组织渔轮积极探索和扩大了新渔场。不少部门开展多种作业，增加了鰤鱼、鱰鱼、海豚等新品种。同时，各国营海洋渔捞生产部门职工还开展了以改进网具、改进操作方法为中心的技术革命运动。所有这些，不仅促进了去年生产的大跃进，而且为今年更大更好更全面的跃进打下了基础。
    我国海岸线长约一万二千多公里，地处温带，饵料充足，是各种鱼类集群生长的良好场所。鱼产量极为丰富、品种繁多，不下一千五百多种。近几年来，我国海洋渔捞事业虽有很大发展，但有些渔场仍有很大潜力，有不少广大的渔场目前还未开拓，有些海区，有些品种，特别是上、中层鱼类，还利用不足或几乎没有利用。根据这一情况，会议确定了今年国营水产企业捕捞生产实现更大跃进的任务，并且要实现大面积丰产，保证20％以上的作业渔轮能够达到丰产船的要求。
    会议根据海洋渔捞生产的规律和去年一年来大跃进的实践，总结了海洋渔捞生产的“找、保、兼、改、安”五字经验。会议认为，虽然今年国营企业的海洋渔捞任务比较繁重，但是只要继续加强党的领导，切实做到政治挂帅，并正确推行这“五字”经验，今年的任务就能保证完成和超额完成。“找”，就是找渔场，找资源，挖掘海洋潜力。今年所有国营渔捞企业的生产渔船，都要结合生产负担起调查任务，切实做到“大家生产，共同找鱼”。“保”，就是保护资源，繁殖资源。坚决不到禁渔区生产，如果在作业中发现幼鱼群时，也要转移渔场，避免滥捕。“兼”，就是兼作轮作，开展多种作业。“改”，就是改革船网工具，改进操作方法，进一步提高劳动生产率。“安”，就是生产必须确保安全。
    这次会议从2月23日开始，到3月4日结束。
