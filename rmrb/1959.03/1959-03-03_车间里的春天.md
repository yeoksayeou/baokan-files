    Spring in the Workshop
    Liu Yi
    This year's spring is an extraordinary season. Firstly, we will be discussing a plan for an even greater leap forward in 1959 during the spring; secondly, everyone will also be drafting personal leap forward plans for ideology and learning; thirdly, everyone has an idea to give the Party some gifts at the beginning of this even greater leap forward. While everyone was discussing this, Party Secretary Lao Yang gave a report to all the factory workers. He skillfully integrated the unprecedented national Great Leap Forward of 1958 with our factory's Great Leap Forward. Every single thing was inspiring. When Party Secretary Lao Yang reported that our output in 1959 would double that of 1958, people were thrilled. Discussions were everywhere in the workshop, and everyone was drafting plans and studying concrete measures to complete the targets. Everyone was eager to try.
    The typesetting workers are truly skillful, and spring comes to them earliest. Look! That young Xiao, who is not very tall and a bit chubby, raised the first red flag of the leap forward in the days of the Great Leap Forward last year. His daily output jumped from 10,000 characters to more than 36,000 characters. This year, he wants to leap forward to new targets and strive to create a new national typesetting record. When he timidly told the new target to Party Branch Secretary Lao Hu, Lao Hu happily patted Xiao on the back and said, "Good lad, the workers of our time must have the determination to fear neither heaven nor earth, and they must have a tenacity that is even more resilient than an ox." From the first day of 1959, Xiao has been working day and night with the veterans to research and improve the type case. The little airplane on the gift-giving platform is rushing upward with all its might.
    Hard work and smart work are like inseparable twin sisters. Our type-casting workers deeply understand this principle. Li Xiushu, who is only twenty-two years old, may look thin and not very tall, but he has a booming heart. He has been thinking for a long time, when will our type-casting workers be able to operate many machines like textile workers. His heart warms up when he thinks of these things, but then he thinks, based on his own abilities, he is only a third-grade worker in terms of technology, and in terms of education, he was an illiterate when he entered Beijing City eight years ago. Although he has worked hard for the past few years, he is only at the level of the first year of junior high school. It was the Party that helped him overcome his inferiority complex, it was the Party that gave him endless wisdom, and it was the Party that gave him booming confidence and perseverance. Difficulties can never stop the young people cultivated by the Party. Thus, the experiment of operating three machines by one person was successful.
    The workers in the printing workshop and the repair workshop are as thrilled as the workers in the typesetting workshop. Take the full-folio Miller printing press that has been in the warehouse for fourteen years! This machine was destroyed by the Japanese devils when they retreated from Shenyang in 1945. It couldn't be repaired in Shenyang, so it was moved to Beijing. Some kind people wanted to wake her up from her slumber, and they sent her to the "hospital." After more than half a year of "diagnosis," it was proved that this machine was pieced together from three broken machines, and it could only be scrapped and recast. However, in the days of the Great Leap Forward, the Party Secretary personally took charge, and the veteran technician Hou Yongfu took the lead and mobilized all the workers in the workshop to offer suggestions. In a short period of three months, this scrapped machine was repaired. A few days before the Spring Festival, this scrapped machine roared to life, and clear prints were printed out one after another.
    In the binding workshop, which has just moved into the new factory building, workers are making a crash effort, and many tasks after the Spring Festival have also been completed ahead of schedule. The workshop is full of sunshine, which warms people's hearts. In the middle of the workshop, there is a long dragon-like collating machine made of wood, and a thin young man is guarding her side. He touches here and straightens there. This is Sun Jianzhang, the creator of this machine. This is the first gift he gave to the spring of 1959, and it will soon be put into production. After this machine is put into production, it can improve work efficiency six times, and from then on, the binding process will have one less manual operation process.
    Spring is an extraordinary season, and the spring in our workshop is even more boiling and full of vitality than the spring of the season.

    车间里的春天
    柳毅
    今年的春天是个不平凡的季节。一则我们要在春天讨论1959年更加跃进的计划；再则每个人还要订出个人思想和学习的跃进规划，三则大伙还有个念头，在这更加跃进的开始，给党送点什么礼物。大伙正在议论的当儿，党委书记老杨向全厂职工做了报告，他巧妙的把1958年空前的全国大跃进，和我们工厂的大跃进揉合在一起了，件件事都激动人心。当党委书记老杨报告我们1959年的产量要比1958年再翻一番的时候，人们沸腾起来了，车间到处都是议论，到处都在订规划，研究完成指标的具体措施，个个摩拳擦掌，人人跃跃欲试。
    排字工人真是心灵手巧，春天最早来到他们手中。你们看吧！那个个儿不高，胖敦敦的年轻的小萧，在去年的大跃进的日子里，他举起第一面的跃进红旗，日产量一下就从一万字跃进到三万六千多字。今年他又要向新的指标跃进，并争取创造全国排字的新纪录。当他把新的指标腼腼腆腆地告诉党支部书记老胡时，老胡乐哈哈的拍着小萧的背膀说：“好小伙子，我们这个时代的工人，就是要有天不怕，地不怕的决心，就是要有比牛还坚韧的干劲。”从1959年的第一天开始，小萧就日日夜夜的和老将们研究改进字架，献礼台上的小飞机，一个劲儿的往上窜。
    苦干和巧干就像一对孪生的姐妹一样的难舍难离。我们铸字工人深深地懂得这个道理，刚刚二十二岁的李修树，你别看他人长的精瘦精瘦的，个儿也不太高，可是他却有一颗蓬蓬勃勃的心。不知打哪时候起，他就老想，我们铸字工人，多咱能像纺织工人那样，一个人开好多台机器，一想到这些，他的心就热乎乎的，可是又一想，就凭自己这两下子，论技术才是三级工，论文化水平，八年前进北京城时，还是个目不识丁的睁眼瞎，虽然苦练了这几年，也不过刚刚是初中一的水平。是党帮助了他克服了自卑感，是党给他无穷无尽的智慧，是党给他蓬蓬勃勃的信心和毅力，困难也就永远也挡不住党培养出来的青年人。于是，一个人开三台机器试验成功了。
    印刷车间和修配车间的工人也和排字车间一样的沸腾起来了。就拿那台在仓库里呆了十四年的全张米力机来说吧！这台机器，是日本鬼子1945年在沈阳溃退时炸毁的，在沈阳没法修理，搬到北京，也曾有过好心的人，想把她从沉睡中唤醒，也曾把她送进“医院”，经过半年多的“诊断”，证明了这台机器是三台破机器拼凑起来的，只有报废，回炉重铸。可是，在大跃进的日子里，党委书记亲自挂帅，老技工侯永福亲自动手，发动全车间工人献策献计，在三个月的短短时间里就把这一台报废的机器修好了。春节的前几天，这台报废的机器轰轰??的开动起来了，一张一张字迹清晰的印品印刷出来了。
    刚刚搬进新厂房的装订车间，工人正在突击，许多春节后的工作也都提前完成了。车间里到处都是阳光，照的人心里暖洋洋的。车间的正中间，放着一台长龙似的用木头制成的配页机，一个身材瘦小的年轻人，守候在她的身边。他摸摸这儿，正正那儿，这就是这台机器的创造者孙建章，这是他赠给1959年春天的第一件礼物，很快就要投入生产。这台机器投入生产后，可以提高工作效率六倍，从此装订工序，又少了一个手工操作的过程。
    春天是个不平凡的季节，而我们车间里的春天，却比季节的春天更加沸腾，更加生气勃勃。
