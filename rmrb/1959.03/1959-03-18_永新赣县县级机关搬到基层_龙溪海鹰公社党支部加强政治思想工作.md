　　Yongxin and Ganxian County-Level Organs Move to the Grassroots
　　Longxi Haiying Commune Party Branch Strengthens Political and Ideological Work

　　(Our report) To strengthen leadership at the grassroots level, the Yongxin County Party Committee and the Ganxian County Party Committee in Jiangxi Province have moved all county-level departments to work at the grassroots units.

　　During the spring plowing production appraisal and inspection, the Yongxin County Party Committee discovered that some cadres below the commune level lacked experience in leading commune production. To meet the requirements of spring plowing production, the Yongxin County Party Committee decided to assign all members of the County Party Committee to different areas. In addition to overseeing the work of the entire county, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally took charge of the largest commune in the county with the highest production requirements, the Panzhong Commune. Except for a few personnel responsible for the steel industry, all departments of politics and law, propaganda and education, industry and transportation, finance and trade, etc., will retain only one or two people at home to maintain necessary upper and lower connections. From now until the completion of rice transplanting, the work of the organs will be entirely shifted to the communes, and the cadres will be assigned to management districts or production teams, focusing on cooperating with the commune Party committees to do a good job in the central tasks, while also handling business work locally. In whichever commune, the focus of business will be on that commune, doing a good job in both agricultural production and business "experimental fields." Departments will implement large-scale integration, establish an overall perspective, complete spring plowing production and their own business, and combine to promote other work.

　　Currently, more than ten departments and more than two hundred cadres have moved to the communes to work and participate in production, bringing with them luggage, daily office supplies, and living necessities. After the finance and trade departments moved to the Litian Commune, in addition to leading the masses to do a good job in spring plowing, they helped the commune do a good job in financial accounting and summarized the commune's experience in establishing financial management in terms of business. After the County Party Committee moved to the Nantang Management District of the Panzhong Commune to work and the cadres participated in production, Wu Zhihai, the secretary of the management district's branch, saw the county party committee cadres taking the lead in production and immediately changed his past practice of only leading production and not participating in production, and went to plow the fields with the commune members. After the County Supervisory Committee moved to the Changxi Management District of the Shiqiao People's Commune, they discovered that the masses had a view that "there is no fertilizer to accumulate." They visited old farmers, had cordial conversations, and found ten sources of fertilizer.

　　In addition to sending cadres down to the communes in rotation to become "Five-Good" commune members and to strengthen grassroots leadership, the Ganxian County Party Committee also moved all county organs to work in the communes, and the communes moved to the management districts to work. All cadres in the county were equipped with production tools, and the County Party Committee also divided up battle lines and fixed contract quotas. According to statistics, more than 270 offices have gone deep, and more than 2,000 cadres have entered the front line, accounting for 90% of the total number of cadres in the county. Under the leadership of the in-depth cadres, a high tide of preparations for cultivation, centered on fertilizer and tidying up rice seedling fields, has been set off throughout the county.

　　(Our report) The Zini Cultivation District Party Branch of the Haiying People's Commune in Longxi County, Fujian Province, has paid attention to strengthening political and ideological work in leading spring production. The cadres and commune members have firm leap-forward thinking and strong drive, greatly accelerating the pace of spring plowing production.

　　The Zini Cultivation District Party Branch deeply realized from the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year that doing a good job in political and ideological work is the key to ensuring the Great Leap Forward; there must be leap-forward thinking before there can be leap-forward targets; there must be soaring drive before there can be active measures. Therefore, they paid special attention to grasping political and ideological work in leading the effort to win a greater leap forward this year. They often mobilized commune members to discuss the benefits of the Great Leap Forward to the country and to each individual, and what everyone should do to achieve the Great Leap Forward. At the same time, they also frequently launched the masses to think of ways and offer suggestions around the key issues in production activities at various stages; and with the spirit of "continuous revolution," they educated those who were satisfied with existing achievements and complacent with the status quo to correct incorrect ideas and constantly boost their drive. For example, when carrying out the spring plowing fertilizer accumulation campaign, some commune members said that there were few fertilizer sources and that there was insufficient labor. The Party Branch not only launched commune members to discuss solutions to this problem, but also sent people to find fertilizer sources everywhere, improving the confidence of these commune members ideologically and with concrete facts. In the discussion, many commune members proposed: "Accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating gold, and transporting fertilizer is like transporting grain; people need to eat, and the land needs fertilizer." At the same time, commune members found more than 100 new fertilizer sources, which improved everyone's confidence. The number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation quickly increased by more than 180, from more than 90,000 dan per day to more than 132,000 dan. Within a few days, the average accumulation of farm fertilizer per mu in the entire cultivation area surged to 1,500 dan, becoming the county's fertilizer accumulation champion.

　　Recently, the Cultivation District Party Branch moved the command post to the fields, organizing experienced old farmers to form a rice seedling technology guidance group to prepare seedlings for close planting, and mobilizing commune members to find ways to solve the problem of insufficient labor. Many commune members actively carried out tool reforms to save labor. Old farmers Wu Yutou, Wu Houtou, and others researched and improved more than ten new tools such as direct seeding machines and rice transplanters, which greatly improved the efficiency of direct seeding and transplanting and can save more than 4,000 workdays.

　　Because the Party's political and ideological work has been done well in the Zini Cultivation District, cadres and commune members are all ambitious and full of energy, and the production teams have launched a heated labor competition.

    永新赣县县级机关搬到基层
    龙溪海鹰公社党支部加强政治思想工作
    本报讯　江西永新县委和赣县县委为加强基层领导，县委各部都搬到基层单位办公。
    在春耕生产评比检查中，永新县委发现有些公社以下干部，缺乏领导公社生产的经验。为了适应春耕生产的要求，永新县委决定把全部县委委员分工到片，县委第一书记除了照管全县的工作外，也深入到全县最大、产量要求最高的泮中公社去亲自掌握。除开少数负责钢铁工业的人员外，所有政法、宣教、工交、财贸等部门，只留一到二人在家坚持必要的上下联系外，自现在起至完成插秧止，机关工作全部下到公社、干部下到管理区或生产队，配合公社党委搞好中心工作为主，就地兼搞业务。在哪个公社，业务就以哪个公社为重点，搞好农业生产、业务工作两个试验田。部门与部门之间，实行大结合，树立全局观点，完成春耕生产和本身业务，结合推动其他工作。
    现在，已有十多个部门、二百多名干部带着行李和日常办公用品、生活用品下到公社办公和参加生产。财贸部门下到里田公社后，除领导群众做好春耕工作外，在业务上帮助该社搞好财务账目、总结公社建立财务管理的经验。县委会搬到泮中公社南塘管理区办公和干部参加生产以后，这个管理区的支部书记吴志海看到县委干部带头生产的行动后，立即改变过去只领导生产不参加生产的作风，和社员一起去犁田。县监委会搬到石桥人民公社长溪管理区后，发现群众有一种“无肥可积”的论调，他们便上门访问老农户，亲切地交谈，找出了十种肥源。
    赣县县委除轮流下放干部到公社当“五好”社员和充实基层领导外，又把全县各机关搬到公社办公，公社则搬到管理区办公，全县所有干部一律配备生产工具，县委也划分战线，固定包干。据统计，全县深入下去的办公室有二百七十多个，进入第一线的干部达二千多名，占全县干部总数的90％。在干部深入的领导下，全县已掀起了以肥料挂帅、整理秧田为中心的备耕高潮。
    本报讯　福建省龙溪县海鹰人民公社紫泥耕作区党支部，在领导春季生产中注意加强政治思想工作，干部和社员跃进思想牢，干劲足，大大加快了春耕生产的步伐。
    紫泥耕作区党支部从去年大跃进的经验中，深深体会到：作好政治思想工作，是保证大跃进的关键，有跃进的指标必先有跃进的思想；有积极的措施又必先有冲天的干劲。因此，他们在领导争取今年更大跃进中，特别注意抓政治思想工作。他们经常发动社员讨论大跃进对国家和对每个人的好处，为了实现大跃进每个人应作些什么等问题。同时他们还经常围绕各个时期生产活动中的关键性问题，发动群众想办法，献计策；并以“不断革命”的精神，教育那些满足已有成绩、安于现状的人纠正不正确思想，不断地鼓足干劲。如，在开展春耕积肥运动时，有的社员说肥源少，说劳力不足。党支部一面就这个问题发动社员讨论解决办法，一面派人四处找肥源，从思想上和用具体事实提高这些社员的信心。在讨论中，许多社员提出：“积肥如积金，运肥如运粮；人要吃饭，地要下肥。”同时社员们找到了一百多处新肥源，提高了大家的信心，参加积肥的人数很快增加了一百八十多人，由原来日积九万多担激增到十三万二千多担。全耕作区几天内每亩平均积农家肥激增到一千五百担，成为全县的积肥冠军。
    最近耕作区党支部把指挥部搬到田间，一面组织有丰富生产经验的老农成立了秧田技术指导组，为密植准备好秧苗；一面发动社员想办法解决劳力不足的困难。许多社员积极进行工具改革来节省劳力。老农吴芋头、吴戽斗等人研究改进了直播机、插秧机等十多种新工具，大大提高了直播和插秧的效率，可以节省四千多个工。
    紫泥耕作区由于党的政治思想工作做得好，干部、社员个个雄心勃勃，干劲冲天，各生产队展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。
