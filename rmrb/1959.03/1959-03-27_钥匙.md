    The Key
    Wu Lü
    How much potential is there for increasing labor productivity? This is probably a treasure that cannot be measured with numbers. A quick glance at newspapers from various regions shows countless instances of advanced deeds of "one person doing the work of two" or "one person doing the work of five." Today, this newspaper is publishing another news item from Zhangjiakou. In Zhangjiakou, it is no longer just a few advanced producers who are achieving "one person doing the work of two" or "one person doing the work of five," but a significant number of workers have realized their pledge of “one person doing the work of two,” “one person doing the work of five,” or even “one person doing the work of eight,” and all the workers in the city are advancing towards this advanced goal. This shows that there is great potential for increasing labor productivity.
    Why are so many workers in Zhangjiakou able to achieve "one person doing the work of two," "one person doing the work of five," or even "one person doing the work of eight"? Why do all the workers in the city have the courage to advance towards this advanced goal? I think this is inseparable from Zhangjiakou's adoption of large-scale mass movements to improve labor productivity.
    Originally, the continuous improvement of labor productivity is the objective law of socialist economy. Socialism has eliminated the inherent contradiction of capitalism between the socialization of production and the private ownership of the means of production. The working class is no longer the exploited but the masters of the enterprise, and therefore, they can give full play to their infinite wisdom and strength, providing excellent conditions for continuously reforming production technology and improving labor productivity. However, it is not enough to merely recognize this objective superior condition. To fully utilize the role of this superior condition, subjective effort is still required. In particular, whether labor productivity is not only continuously increasing but also continuously and rapidly increasing depends even more on the degree of subjective effort. This is the role of the subjective on the objective.
    Our purpose in understanding the objective world is to give full play to our subjective initiative to transform the objective world. Our purpose in understanding thousands of objective laws is also to give full play to our subjective initiative to apply objective laws. Zhangjiakou's use of large-scale mass movements to improve labor productivity is an example of fully utilizing the superior conditions provided by socialist society for continuously improving labor production, giving full play to subjective initiative, and accelerating the rate of increase in labor productivity. It is conceivable that if the goal of improving labor productivity had not been loudly proclaimed, and large-scale mass movements had not been carried out around this goal, the labor productivity of Zhangjiakou's industrial enterprises would have improved with the development of production technology, but the speed would certainly not be as fast as it is today. If we want to rapidly improve labor productivity, we must carry out large-scale mass movements like Zhangjiakou, and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of thousands of workers.
    The potential for improving labor productivity is extremely considerable. The key to unlocking this treasure is to carry out large-scale mass movements.

    提高劳动生产率的潜力究竟有多大？这恐怕是一个无法用数字来测定的宝藏。翻翻各地的报纸，“一顶二”、“一顶五”的先进事迹触目皆是。今天，本报又发表了张家口市的一条新闻。在张家口，已经不是个别先进生产者“一顶二”、“一顶五”，而是相当多的工人实现了
  “一顶二”、“一顶五”、甚至“一顶八”的誓言，并且全市的工人都在朝这个先进的目标前进。这就可以看出，提高劳动生产率是大有可为的。
    为什么张家口市有这么多的工人能够“一顶二”、“一顶五”、甚至“一顶八”呢？为什么全市的工人都有这样的胆略向这个先进目标前进呢？我想，这是同张家口市采用大搞群众运动的办法来提高劳动生产率分不开的。
    本来，劳动生产率的不断提高，就是社会主义经济的客观规律。社会主义消灭了资本主义所固有的生产社会化和生产资料私人占有制的矛盾，工人阶级不再是被剥削者，而是企业的主人，因此，就能发挥出他们无限的智慧和力量来，为不断地改革生产技术、提高劳动生产率提供了优越的条件。但是，仅仅认识到这个客观的优越条件还是不够的。要充分发挥这个优越条件的作用，总还需要主观的努力。特别是要使劳动生产率不仅是不断增长，而且是不断地迅速增长，更决定于主观努力的程度如何。这是主观对于客观的作用。
    我们认识客观世界的目的，在于发挥主观能动性去改造客观世界。我们认识千百条客观规律的目的，也在于发挥主观能动性去运用客观规律。张家口市用大搞群众运动的办法来提高劳动生产率，就是充分运用社会主义社会所提供的不断提高劳动生产的优越的条件，发挥主观能动性，加快劳动生产率增长速度的一个例子。可以设想，如果不是响亮地提出了提高劳动生产率的目标，围绕着这个目标大搞群众运动，张家口工业企业的劳动生产率虽然也会随着生产技术的发展得到提高，但速度决不像今日这般快，我们要迅速地提高劳动生产率，就要像张家口那样地大搞群众运动，把千千万万职工的积极性和创造性组织起来。
    提高劳动生产率的潜力极为可观。挖开这个宝藏的钥匙，就是大搞群众运动。
