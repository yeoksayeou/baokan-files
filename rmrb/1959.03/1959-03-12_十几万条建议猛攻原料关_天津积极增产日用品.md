　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th - Tianjin's light industry sectors are actively taking measures to increase the production of daily necessities for the people.

　　Recently, Tianjin has specifically arranged this year's light industry production plan. The total output value of light industry for the entire year will increase by 60% compared to last year. Among them, the output of major products such as paper, soap, batteries, pencils, glass products, enamel basins, bicycles, and sewing machines will all have substantial increases compared to last year.

　　In addition to fully leveraging the potential of existing enterprise equipment to increase the production of daily light industrial products, Tianjin's light industry sector will also build and expand some enterprises this year. There are a total of thirty-four key projects for new construction and expansion. The newly built light bulb factory can produce four million light bulbs this year. Most of the expanded enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises with low investment, fast construction speed, and high returns. After small-scale expansions of the Huifu, Dalu, Weidi, and Tianjin pharmaceutical factories, the output of the sixteen types of raw materials needed to manufacture antibiotics, sulfa drugs, and other pharmaceuticals this year will increase fifteen-fold compared to last year.

　　The city's light industry workers are launching a technical revolution movement to solve the key production issues such as raw materials in increasing production. Workers have already put forward more than ten thousand technical innovation suggestions, and currently, over ten thousand suggestions are being implemented. These include improving product design, improving formulas, innovating process operations, self-manufacturing raw materials, finding substitutes, and comprehensive utilization, most of which are effective methods for solving raw material problems. The medical equipment factory uses porcelain tubes to replace steel in the production of distillers, which not only saves more than seven hundred tons of steel and copper materials but also reduces a large amount of labor hours, and the cost is reduced by 80%. The Zhongda Paper Mill has created the experience of making caustic soda using indigenous methods, which has been promoted to all paper mills in the city. Tianjin's commercial departments are also vigorously assisting light industry departments in solving raw material problems. As of the end of February, waste product companies in various districts have purchased a total of more than 28,900 tons of waste glass, waste rubber, miscellaneous copper, and waste steel, which have been supplied to light industrial factories. The department store purchasing and supply station has purchased 120 tons of borax, boracite, and other materials from other places, meeting the production needs of various enamel factories in the first quarter. The chemical and pharmaceutical purchasing and supply stations have supplied light industrial factories with nearly two million sacks, wooden boxes, bottles, and other packaging materials in the past two months, enabling the timely delivery of manufactured goods from the factories.

　　The production plans of Tianjin's light industry system for January and February have been overfulfilled. Paper production alone has increased by more than 600 tons. The total output value of light industry in January and February increased by 60.9% compared to the same period last year. The output of major products such as enamel basins, injections, and tablets increased by 70% to 1.6 times compared to the same period last year. The output of small commodities needed for people's daily lives, such as collar hooks, pacifiers, and hair clips, has also increased significantly compared to the same period last year. At present, the city's light industry workers are advancing victoriously, launching a heated competition movement for high production, high quality, and multiple varieties.

    十几万条建议猛攻原料关
    天津积极增产日用品
    新华社天津10日电　天津市轻工业部门各个行业正在积极采取措施，增产人民生活日用品。
    最近，天津市具体安排了今年的轻工业生产计划。全年轻工业总产值将比去年提高60％，其中纸张、肥皂、电池、铅笔、玻璃制品、搪瓷脸盆、自行车、缝纫机等主要产品的产量，都将比去年有较大的增长。
    天津市轻工业部门除了充分发挥现有企业设备潜力以增产日用轻工业品以外，今年还要新建和扩建一些企业，新建和扩建的重点项目共有三十四个。新建的电灯泡厂今年就可以生产灯泡四百万支。扩建的企业，大部分是投资少、建设速度快、收效大的中小型企业。惠符、大陆、伟迪氏、天津等制药厂进行少量扩建以后，今年制造抗菌素、磺胺类等药品所需要的十六种原料药的产量，就将比去年增长十五倍。
    全市轻工业职工们正在开展技术革命运动，来解决增产中的原材料等生产关键问题。职工们已经提出了十几万件技术革新建议，目前有上万件建议正在付诸实现，其中包括改进产品设计、改进配方、革新工艺操作、自制原料、寻找代用品、综合利用等等，绝大多数是解决原材料问题的有效办法。医疗器械厂用瓷管代替钢材生产蒸馏器，不但能节约钢材和铜料七百多吨，并且可以减少大量工时，成本也降低80％。中达造纸厂创造了土法制火碱的经验，已在全市各造纸厂推广。天津市商业部门也大力协助轻工业部门解决原材料问题。各区废品公司到2月底已经收购废玻璃、废橡胶、杂铜、废钢铁等共二万八千九百多吨，供给了轻工业工厂。百货采购供应站已经从外地采购到硼砂、硼石等一百二十吨，满足了各搪瓷厂第一季度生产的需要。化工、医药两个采购供应站，两个月来共供应轻工业工厂近二百万件麻袋、木箱、瓶子等包装用品，使工厂制出的商品能够及时出厂。
    天津市轻工业系统1、2月份的生产计划都已超额完成，仅纸张就增产了六百多吨。1、2月份轻工业总产值比去年同期增长了60.9％，搪瓷脸盆、针剂、片剂等主要产品的产量分别比去年同期增长70％到一点六倍，人民日常生活所需的领钩、奶嘴、发卡等小商品也都比去年同期增产很多。目前，全市轻工业职工正乘胜前进，展开热烈的高产、优质、多品种的竞赛运动。
