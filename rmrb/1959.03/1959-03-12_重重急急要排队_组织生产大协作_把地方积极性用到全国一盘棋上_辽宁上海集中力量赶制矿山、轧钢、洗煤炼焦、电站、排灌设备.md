This paper Shenyang, 11th dispatch. Liaoning Province's ten cities and thousands of industrial and mining enterprises, establishing a nationwide perspective, unfolded a great communist collaboration, and worked together to ensure the production of the key points of decisive significance—the four major steel enterprises, four major coal mines, and five major mechanical products—to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in industrial production.

Liaoning Province's various industrial departments are undertaking even more arduous tasks this year than last year, and various production targets have been raised significantly compared to last year. In terms of planned targets, the province's steel and steel material production this year account for more than one-third of the country's total, raw coal accounts for 13.5%, and rolling mill sets account for one-quarter of the country's total. In order to implement the principle of "taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward," the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of the nationwide perspective, convened a provincial industrial collaboration conference and organized the province's workers to unfold a great communist collaboration, concentrating efforts to first ensure that key enterprises and key products that are related to the overall situation complete or overfulfill their tasks with quality and quantity as scheduled. These key points are: the four major steels—Anshan Iron and Steel, Benxi Iron and Steel, Dalian Steel Plant, Fushun Steel Plant; the four major mines—Fushun Coal Mine, Fuxin Coal Mine, Benxi Coal Mine, Beipiao Coal Mine; the five major products—rolling mill equipment, mining and beneficiation equipment, coking equipment, power generation equipment, and irrigation and drainage equipment.

Having completed the task of manufacturing rolling mill equipment ahead of schedule last year, the workers in Liaoning Province's machinery industry are now tasked with manufacturing twenty-four sets of rolling mills for various parts of the country. Most of these rolling mills are medium-sized and large-sized, with complex parts, large castings and forgings, and tight deadlines. Judging from the current production capacity, it is difficult for any one factory or even one city to manufacture them as complete sets. In order to break through the "large-scale barrier" and strive for time, hundreds of factories in Dalian, Fushun, Shenyang, and other cities have formed a close collaborative network, going all out to undertake the task of manufacturing this batch of rolling mill equipment. All the model processing plants in the Lüda Municipality have been mobilized to rush the production of models for the rolling mills. Some factories, in order to get the rolling mills up and running as soon as possible, have used their existing materials as a substitute before the special materials allocated by the state arrive. Dalian Shipyard, which is responsible for two roughing mills, has already used materials originally intended for shipbuilding to cast hundreds of tons of castings and forgings. The workers of Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant, who are responsible for manufacturing the main engine of the first domestically produced rail beam mill, felt the importance of striving for time when they learned that this machine could produce three thousand tons of steel rails a day, and immediately used materials as a substitute to put this machine into production quickly. The province's workers have also taken on the heavy responsibility of producing the remaining four key mechanical products through the same large-scale collaboration. In order to coordinate actions and create conditions for each other, production dispatch offices have been established from the provincial level to various cities, specifically to direct the production of the five major key products, ensuring that these products are completed satisfactorily according to specifications, quantities, and schedules.

Whatever the key points need, we will do our best to support them. Various cities and enterprises have checked warehouses, revealed their reserves, and "raised food" for the key points. When Dalian Steel Plant was suffering from a lack of oxalic acid for the production of cemented carbide, Fushun City immediately opened its warehouse and took out all the existing twenty tons of oxalic acid to guarantee the factory's needs for a quarter. Rolling mills need ferrosilicon, and Jinzhou Heavy Machinery Plant, Dalian Electric Motor Plant, and Dalian Machinery No. 5 Plant, upon hearing the news, contributed their stock of ferrosilicon without hesitation. Various enterprises also automatically reviewed and compressed raw material plans to overcome the phenomenon of generous planning and tight usage, so as to rationally use the limited raw materials in key enterprises and key products. The raw material application plan of Fuxin Mining Bureau was compressed four times, and the demand for various materials was greatly reduced. The Xinqiu Coal Mine originally planned to use twenty tons of insulating material, but after repeated review, only five tons were needed. After various cities and enterprises established the idea of ensuring key points, many of the materials originally intended to be requested from the province and the problems reported to the province for resolution were solved through self-reliance and mutual collaboration. Their slogan is: Problems that can be solved by enterprises should not be raised to the city, and problems that can be solved by the city should not be raised to the province.

In order to ensure key points, various cities have checked the collaborative relationships between enterprises. Collaborative relationships that had been interrupted with key enterprises have been restored, and new collaborative relationships that need to be established are being established. The Fuxin Coal Mine needed a batch of low-voltage switches underground, and Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory took the initiative to sign a contract with them to manufacture more than 300 low-voltage switches, guaranteeing the needs of this coal mine in the first and second quarters of this year.

This paper Shanghai, 11th dispatch. Shanghai's machinery and electrical industries resolutely implement the policy of a nationwide perspective and implement the principle of prioritizing "heavy and urgent tasks," and are concentrating their superior forces to speed up, shorten the manufacturing cycle, and rush the production of rolling, power station, mining, coal washing, coking, and irrigation and drainage equipment. Various departments and factories have made completing the above-mentioned key products their top political task.

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has strengthened its inspection, supervision, and leadership of this work. The Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Production Committee has conducted inspections of various industrial bureaus and key factories together with the various industrial bureaus. It requires various bureaus and factories to first ensure key points, carefully prioritize production tasks based on their importance and urgency, and establish various inspection systems.

So far, the manufacturing tasks of rolling, power station, mining, coal washing, coking, and irrigation and drainage equipment received by Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industries this year have increased several times compared to last year. The quantity is large, the tasks are heavy, and the time is tight. Most of the equipment must be completed in the first half of the year. The total weight of the parts already undertaken by the mechanical industry department alone is more than 30,000 tons. Among them are thousands of sets of various crushing and grinding machines, mining and excavating equipment, geological drilling rigs, large-scale coking machines with an annual output of 450,000 tons, transportation machines, air compressors, diesel engines, etc., as well as more than 30 sets of section steel rolling mills with an annual output of 250,000 tons of steel, medium plate machines with an annual output of 200,000 tons of steel, and non-ferrous metal rolling equipment.

In order to ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of various large-scale equipment, Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industries have taken swift and effective measures. Whenever the Machinery Bureau receives a production task assigned by the central government, it often prepares overnight, and the next day, it assigns the production task to the factory. If the raw materials allocated by the central government from various places cannot be transported in time, they are immediately given priority from the existing materials. Various factories also list these products as the factory's primary task. In January and February, the city's workers continued to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and have completed seven sets of rolling mills, 100,000-kilowatt turbine generators, ten sets of simple coking equipment, one hundred sets of mining and excavating equipment, more than two hundred sets of mining crushing machinery, and two hundred and fifty diesel engines.

According to the spirit of "prioritizing heavy and urgent tasks," Shanghai's manufacturing tasks for key equipment in March are close to or exceed the sum of the actual output of the previous two months. Shanghai's various industrial departments have taken a series of measures in terms of production arrangements, raw material allocation, collaborative cooperation, and complete product sets. Various industrial bureaus have also listed the progress of various key products and assigned special personnel to be responsible for inspection. The Shanghai Municipal Machinery Bureau is holding a series of on-site meetings in response to the manufacturing tasks of several major equipment. At the rolling mill on-site meeting held in early March, in order to shorten the manufacturing cycle of rolling mills and concentrate the use of raw materials and steel castings, the Machinery Bureau changed the original practice of simultaneously manufacturing several sets of the same type of rolling mills with several factories as the center, and decided to concentrate its efforts to expand the scope of cooperation, complete one set first, and then do another. In this way, a set of thin plate machines and a set of section steel rolling mills that were originally estimated to be impossible to complete in March can be rushed out.

Hundreds of factories undertaking the manufacturing of the six major equipment have redeployed production according to national tasks. The Hudong Shipyard, which undertook the manufacturing of a large number of smelting equipment last year, originally planned to strive to manufacture a set of rolling mills in March, and then strive to complete the main engines of two sets of rolling mills. Recently, the factory's party committee, according to national needs, proposed to make the manufacture of rolling mills the central task that overrides everything else, and required that the first set of rolling mills and the processing tasks of the other two sets of main engines be completed ahead of schedule by the end of March. Now, not only have all the machining workshops in the factory been mobilized, but even the hull workshop, which has never been in contact with machining work, is no exception. The hull workers put forward the slogan of "Martial Arts actors playing female roles, Ants moving Mount Tai," bravely took over the rough processing of the key components of the three rolling mills—eighteen frames, and used gas cutting, chiseling, and other methods instead of machine tool processing. By the 6th, eleven pieces had been completed. The Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, which undertook the manufacturing of a large number of mining and coal washing equipment, adhered to the principle of "urgent among urgent, heavy among heavy," and gave priority to ensuring the manufacture of mining and beneficiation equipment. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, the workers installed hot blast stoves themselves, used local iron and self-refined coke. In January and February, the factory had already produced more than one hundred crushers and a large number of winches and forging machines that can replace the manual operation of more than 100,000 people. Now they are rushing to manufacture 142 crushers to supply simple coal washing plants.

After the factory workers discussed the important significance of completing these equipment, a red flag competition centered on solving key production issues, shortening the manufacturing cycle, and improving labor productivity has been vigorously launched in various factories. The Shanghai Turbine Plant's workers put forward nearly a thousand measures to overcome difficulties and improve production efficiency. Blade production is the biggest key to increasing the production of turbines in this factory. After technical personnel and workers discussed and studied, and worked hard for three days, they finally succeeded in using vertical lathes instead of milling machines to process blades. Originally, milling machines could only process five or six pieces at a time, but now vertical lathes can process 120 pieces at a time, which not only solves the key to mass production of blades, but also saves a lot of high-quality alloy steel.

    重重急急要排队　组织生产大协作
    把地方积极性用到全国一盘棋上
    辽宁上海集中力量赶制矿山、轧钢、洗煤炼焦、电站、排灌设备
    本报沈阳11日电　辽宁全省十个市数千个工矿企业，树立全国一盘棋思想，展开共产主义大协作，齐心协力保证具有决定意义的重点——四大钢铁企业、四大煤矿、五大机械产品的生产，以实现工业生产的全面大跃进。
    辽宁省各工业部门今年担当了比去年更加繁重的任务，各项生产指标都比去年提高很多。就计划指标来说，全省今年的钢和钢材产量都占全国三分之一以上，原煤占全国13.5％，轧钢机套数占全国四分之一。为了贯彻“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，中共辽宁省委根据全国一盘棋的精神，特召开全省工业协作会议，并组织全省职工展开共产主义大协作，集中力量首先保证关系全局的重点企业和重点产品如质如量地完成或超额完成任务。这些重点是：四大钢——鞍钢、本钢、大连钢厂、抚顺钢厂；四大矿——抚顺煤矿、阜新煤矿，本溪煤矿、北票煤矿；五大产品——轧钢设备、矿山洗选设备、炼焦设备、发电设备、排灌设备。
    曾在去年提前完成了轧钢设备制造任务的辽宁省机械行业的职工们，今年又要为全国各地制造二十四套轧钢机。这些轧钢机绝大部分是中型和大型的，部件复杂，铸锻件大，而且时间要求紧迫，从目前的生产能力看，任何一个工厂甚至一个市的范围都很难成套制造。为了突破“大型关”，极力争取时间，大连、抚顺、沈阳等市的成百个工厂，组成严密的协作网，全力以赴地把这批轧钢设备制造任务担当起来。旅大市的全部模型加工厂都动员起来为轧钢机赶制模型。有的工厂为了使轧钢机尽早上马，不等国家调拨的专用材料拿到手，就先把自己现有的材料垫出来使。担负两套初轧机的大连造船厂，已经垫出原来准备造船用的材料铸成了几百吨铸锻件。承担国产第一套轨梁轧机主机制造任务的抚顺重型机器厂的职工们，当知道了这台机器一天能吐出三千吨钢轨时，越发感到争取时间的重要，便立刻垫出材料使这台机器很快投入生产。全省职工也通过同样的大协作挑起了制作其余四种重点机械产品的重担。为了协同动作，互相创造条件，从省到各市都成立了生产调度办公室，专门指挥五大重点产品的生产，保证这些产品按规格、按数量、按进度地圆满完成任务。
    重点需要什么，就尽力支援什么，各市各企业纷纷查仓库、亮家底，为重点“筹粮”。当大连钢厂正苦于生产硬质合金没有草酸的时候，抚顺市立即打开仓库把现有的二十吨草酸全部拿出来，保证了这个工厂一个季度的需要。轧钢机需要矽铁，金州重型机器厂、大连电机厂、大连机械五厂闻讯就毫不犹疑地把库存矽铁贡献出来。各企业还自动地复核压缩原材料计划，克服宽打窄用现象，以便把有限的原材料合理地使用在重点企业、重点产品上。阜新矿务局的申请原材料计划经过四次压缩，各种材料的需求量都大大减少。新丘煤矿原计划要绝缘材料二十吨，经过再三审查后，只要五吨就够了。各市各企业树立保证重点的思想后，原打算伸手向省里要的材料、报请省里解决的问题，有很多都通过自力更生、互相协作的办法得到解决了。他们的口号是：企业能解决的问题不提到市、市能解决的问题不提到省。
    为了保证重点，各市都检查了企业之间的协作关系。曾和重点企业中断了的协作关系，需要恢复的已经恢复，新的协作关系需要建立的正在建立。阜新煤矿井下需要一批低压开关，沈阳低压开关厂便主动和他们签订合同承制三百多台低压开关，保证了这个煤矿今年第一、二季度的需要。
    本报上海11日电　上海市机械、电机工业部门坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，实行“重重急急”要排队的原则，正集中优势力量，加快速度，缩短制造周期，赶制轧钢、电站、矿山、洗煤、炼焦和排灌等设备。各个部门、各个工厂已把完成上列重点产品作为当前头等重要的政治任务。
    最近中共上海市委加强了对这一工作的检查、督促和领导。市委工业生产委员会已经会同各工业局对各局和重点工厂进行了检查。要求各局各厂首先保证重点，对生产任务要分别轻重缓急，认真排队。并建立了各项检查制度。
    到目前为止，上海市机电工业今年已接到的轧钢、电站、矿山、洗煤、炼焦和排灌等设备的制造任务，比去年都有成倍增长。数量大、任务重、时间紧，绝大部分设备要在上半年内完成。仅机械工业部门已经承接的部分，总重量就达三万吨以上。其中有各种破碎研磨机械、矿山采掘设备、地质钻探机、年产四十五万吨的大型炼焦机、运输机、空气压缩机、柴油机等几千台，以及年产二十五万吨钢材的型钢轧钢机、年产二十万吨钢材的中板机和有色压延设备等三十多套。
    为了保证按时、按质、按量地完成各项大型设备，上海市机电工业部门采取了迅速有力措施。机械局每当接到中央安排下来的生产任务以后，经常连夜准备，第二天，就把生产任务布置到工厂，中央从各地调拨的原材料一时赶运不及，立即从已有材料中优先供应。各个工厂也把这些产品列为工厂的首要任务。1、2月份，全市工人继续发扬了苦干、实干、巧干的精神，已完成了七套轧钢机、十万瓩汽轮发电机、十套简易炼焦设备、一百台矿山采掘设备、二百多台矿山破碎机械和二百五十台柴油机。
    上海市根据“重重急急”的精神，3月份重点设备的制造任务都接近或超过了前两个月实际产量的总和。上海市各个工业部门从生产安排、原材料分配、协作配合、产品成套等方面，又采取了一系列措施。各工业局并将各项重点产品进度排列出来，指定专人负责检查。上海市机械局针对几大设备制造任务正在召开一系列现场会议。3月初举行的轧钢机现场会议上，机械局为了缩短轧钢机制造周期，集中原材料和铸钢件的使用，改变了原先分别以几个厂为中心同时制造好几套同类型轧机的做法，决定集中力量，扩大协作面，先完成一套，再搞一套。这样，原来估计3月份不能完成的一套薄板机和一套型钢轧机都能赶制出来。
    承制六大设备的数百家工厂都根据国家任务，重新部署了生产。去年承制了大批冶炼设备的沪东造船厂原来打算争取在3月份制造出一套轧钢机，再力争完成两套轧钢机的主机。最近，工厂党委根据国家需要，提出了把制造轧机作为压倒一切的中心任务，要求第一套轧钢机和另二套主机加工任务都要提前在3月底完成。现在，不仅全厂所有的机械加工车间都已动起来了，就连从来没有接触过机械加工活的船体车间也不例外，船体工人提出了“武生唱花旦、蚂蚁搬泰山”的口号，勇敢地把三台轧钢机的关键部件——十八块机架的粗加工包了下来，用气割、批凿等方法代替了机床加工，到6日已完成了十一块。承担了大批矿山洗煤设备的上海矿山机器厂本着“急中有急、重中有重”的原则，优先保证制造采矿洗选设备，为了解决原材料不足的困难，工人自己动手安装热风炉，利用土铁、自炼焦炭，1、2月份，这个厂已经生产了可代替十多万人手工操作的一百多台破碎机和大批卷扬机、锻钎机。现在正在突击赶制一百四十二台破碎机，供应简易洗煤厂。
    工厂职工在讨论了完成这些设备的重要意义以后，一个以解决生产关键、缩短制造周期、提高劳动生产率为中心的红旗竞赛，已经在各个工厂蓬蓬勃勃地展开。上海汽轮机厂职工提出了近千条克服困难、提高生产效率的措施。叶片生产是这个工厂增产汽轮机的最大关键，经过技术人员和工人讨论研究，苦战三天，终于用立车代替铣床加工叶片试验成功，原来用铣床，一次只能加工五六块，现用立车一次可以加工一百二十块，不但解决了大量生产叶片的关键，还可节省大量的高质合金钢。（图片）
