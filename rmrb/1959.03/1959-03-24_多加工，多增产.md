More Processing, More Production
　　Yu Ming
　　In the mass movement to strive for high wheat yields over large areas, the vast majority of commune members in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, are determined to "not stop managing until the wheat is in hand," and are striving for perfection in field management. However, a few commune members have developed two kinds of thinking: one is "the wheat is growing miraculously, it will yield a thousand catties even if we don't manage it"; the other is "it's only two months until wheat harvest, further efforts won't make much of a difference." The former is a manifestation of complacency; the latter is an expression of discouragement. The two kinds of thinking have different forms of expression, but their essence is the same: the overall situation of wheat is settled, and there is no need to further exert human subjective initiative. Both of these ideas are inconsistent with the actual situation and are harmful.
　　Having the confidence of a thousand catties per mu is good. However, if this confidence is not based on practical actions, but rather "it will yield a thousand catties even if we don't manage it," then it is not true confidence. Now, in most areas, the wheat has passed the greening stage, some areas are starting to pass the jointing stage, and there are still the most important stages of heading, flowering, and grain filling to go through. During this period, there are many potential disasters that can occur, and a slight oversight can reduce production by several percent. Under these circumstances, how can we "not manage"?
　　Two months may not seem like a long time, but for wheat, it is by no means "not much of a difference," but rather extremely important. For example, last year, the 2,200 mu of wheat in the Piding No. 1 Commune in Liu'an, Anhui, achieved a yield of 807 catties per mu, which is a rare large-area high yield in the country. The yield target of this commune was only 400 catties until mid-March last year. In mid-March, the responsible comrades of the provincial and prefectural committees came to the commune to inspect the work, and found that the potential for increased production was still great. They mobilized the masses to discuss and raised the target to 800 catties per mu. Once the target was set at ten points, the spirit of the commune members was greatly uplifted, and measures immediately followed, including timely weeding, topdressing fertilizer according to seedling condition, building supports to prevent lodging, and preventing rust disease early. Party members, Youth League members, and activists were assigned to contract specific plots, with each plot having a dedicated person responsible, and they carried out management diligently and consistently to the end. As a result, although 80% of the wheat contracted rust disease before harvest, because the prevention and treatment were timely, every mu had a bumper harvest, and the yield doubled. In the Dushu Production Team of Luzhen Commune in Shucheng County, last year, one plot of 0.5 mu of wheat was growing very well, but there was no management in the later stage, and as a result, it yielded 150 catties, which is only equivalent to 300 catties per mu; another plot of 0.7 mu was originally growing poorly, but in the later stage of jointing, it was topdressed with human and animal manure twice and wood ash once, and as a result, it yielded a total of 880 catties, which is equivalent to more than 1,000 catties per mu. The two are very different when compared.
　　Shucheng County, Anhui Province, promptly discovered these two kinds of thinking that are not conducive to striving for greater wheat harvests, and launched mass discussions and debates, so that the drums of wheat field management are beating tighter and tighter, and the morale is even more invigorated. This is absolutely necessary. Now the movement for large-area, high-yield wheat production is getting closer and closer to the decisive stage. We must oppose the "settled" thinking that reflects the two emotions of complacency and discouragement, and overcome them with true confidence and the spirit of self-improvement. In this way, we can ensure that we are invincible and further win greater victories.

    多加工，多增产
    于明
    在争取小麦大面积高产的群众运动中，安徽舒城县绝大部分的公社社员，抱定“小麦不到手，管理不罢休”的决心，田间管理精益求精。但也有少数社员产生了两种思想：其一是“麦子长得出神，不管也能收千斤”；其二是“离收麦只有两个月，再努力作用也不大了”。其一是自满情绪的流露；其二是自馁情绪的表现。两种思想的表现形式不同，实质则是相同的：小麦大局已定，不必再发挥人的主观能动性了。这两种思想都是不符合实际情况的，都是有害的。
    有亩产千斤的必胜信心，这是好的。可是，如果不是建立在实际行动中的信心，而是“不管也能收千斤”，那就不是真正的信心。现在大部地区的小麦已经过了返青关，有的地区开始过拔节关，还有最重要的抽穗、扬花、灌浆等关没有过。在这一期间，可能发生的灾害还很多，稍一疏忽，就会减产几成。在这种情况下，那能“不管”？
    两个多月，看起来不算多长的时间；对麦子来说，却决不是“作用不大”，而是极关重要。如去年安徽六安淠东一社的二千二百亩小麦，每亩获得八百零七斤的产量，在全国是少有的大面积丰产。这个社的产量指标，直到去年3月中旬还只有四百斤。3月中旬，省委地委的负责同志到社检查工作，发现增产潜力还很大，发动群众讨论，把指标提高到每亩八百斤。指标定到十分，社员精神便为之一振，措施随之立刻跟上，实行了适时锄草、看苗追肥、搭架防倒伏、及早防锈病等办法，做到了党员、团员、积极分子划片包干，块块田有专人负责，踏踏实实，一气到底进行管理。这样做的结果，虽然临收割前80％的小麦发生了锈病，因为防治及时，还是亩亩丰收，产量加番。舒城县芦镇公社大树生产队，去年有一丘五分地的小麦，原来长的很好，后期便没有管理，结果收了一百五十斤，只合亩产三百斤；另一丘七分地，原来长的差，在拔节后期，连追二次人畜粪，一次草木灰，结果共收了八百八十斤，亩产合千斤以上。两相对比，相差很多。
    安徽省舒城县及时发现这两种不利于争取小麦更大丰收的思想，发动群众鸣放辩论，使麦田管理的战鼓越敲越紧，士气更加振奋。这是完全必要的。现在小麦大面积高额丰产运动越来越接近决战阶段了。对于反映了自满和自馁两种情绪的“定局”思想，都要反对，要用真正的自信和自强不息的精神战胜它们。这样，才能确保立于不败之地，才能进一步夺得更大的战果。
