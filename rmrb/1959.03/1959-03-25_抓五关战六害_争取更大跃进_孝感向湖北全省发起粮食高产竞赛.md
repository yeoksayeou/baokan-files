　　Xiaogan Launches a Grain High-Yield Competition Throughout Hubei Province
　　(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 24th) Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, holding high the red banner of "Higher Yields, Even Higher Yields, Leap Forward Again and Again," is determined to achieve an average grain yield of 5,000 jin per mu across the county this year. Their battle slogan is: One season (summer harvest crops, including early rice) catches up with the whole year (1958), the whole year doubles, and we vow to win the first place in rice production in the province.
　　In 1958, Xiaogan County had a total of 720,000 mu of grain fields, with a total output of about 1.5 billion jin, leaping from a thousand-jin county in 1957 to a double-thousand-jin county. Recently, Xiaogan County held a county-wide meeting of party organization secretaries above the production team level, as well as administrative and technical cadres, proposing to reach a total output of 3.25 billion jin this year, with an average yield of 5,000 jin per mu. Both total output and yield per unit area will more than double compared to last year, i.e., an increase of more than 100 percent. Cotton will be planted on 30,000 mu, with a yield of 500 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
　　When Xiaogan County formulated its greater leap forward plan for this year through full airing of views and debates, it fully estimated the more favorable situation and conditions this year: The Party's leadership over agricultural production is earlier, tighter, and better than any previous year. In terms of material preparation, improved varieties have been widely used for various crops throughout the county, and seed reserves have increased by two to three times compared to last year; due to the bumper harvests of grain and cotton last year, the production fund reserves of various communes and production teams are also very strong; and the further improvement of the people's living standards has further stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for a greater leap forward. All of these, coupled with the further development of the great superiority of the people's communes and the application of the experience of last year's great leap forward in agriculture, provide a basic guarantee for achieving a greater leap forward this year.
　　Based on summing up the experiences and lessons of last year's grain production and further implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," the county has proposed new technical measures of "grasping the five barriers and battling the six pests to ensure that the rice has many large ears and full grains." Grasping the five barriers: First, the seasonal barrier, appropriately advancing sowing. According to local climatic conditions, the general requirement is that "early rice seedlings should not be transplanted in May, and double-crop late rice seedlings should not be transplanted in August." Second, the strong seedling barrier, cultivating strong seedlings for early and late rice according to the requirement of one million seedlings. Third, the deep plowing barrier, using methods such as tandem plows and mechanized farming, generally deep plowing the rice to seven inches to one foot, carefully cultivating and meticulously working the land to achieve level fields and well-rotted mud. Fourth, the fertilizer barrier, requiring the application of 1,500 to 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, equivalent to about 1,000 jin of bean cake, to ensure sufficient base fertilizer, mixed fertilization, layered fertilization, and staged topdressing, so that crops are well-fed. Fifth, the close planting barrier, requiring 100,000 clumps and one million ears per mu, with 80 to 150 grains per ear. In addition, strengthen field management of crops, fight against the six pests of disease, insects, weeds, waterlogging, drought, and lodging, to ensure the safe growth of crops, and achieve many ears, large ears, and full grains.
　　In order to realize this year's greater leap forward plan, the Xiaogan County Party Committee is carrying out a mass production competition movement centered on technical innovation throughout the county. First, it is required that leaders at all levels take political command, constantly overcome right-leaning conservative sentiments, and systematically establish a set of organizations for the scientific management of agricultural technology. Second, mobilize the masses to start from summing up the production of 1958, adopt the method of airing views, fully speaking out, and debating, to formulate this year's greater leap forward plan and specific technical measures at all levels; at the same time, adopt methods such as running technical training classes to make various technical measures take root among the broad masses. Third, in every production link, plan and purposefully discover and cultivate typical examples, organize visits and comparisons, hold on-site meetings, and promote the technical innovation movement one upsurge after another. Fourth, carry out a high work efficiency movement to ensure that labor productivity doubles.
　　Recently, Xiaogan County has launched a challenge competition to all counties in the province to strive for higher grain yields. The county proposed to resolutely fight the first battle and achieve "one season catching up with the whole year," striving for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu for the county's 250,000 mu of wheat, and ensuring a yield of 3,500 jin per mu for the county's 300,000 mu of early rice, and striving to create 100,000 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat, early rice, and other crops, labor competitions have been widely launched between various people's communes and management areas, production teams, and between commune members. Currently, the county has organized a fertilizer accumulation team of more than 150,000 people, going up mountains and down to lakes, to open up sources of fertilizer, and overfulfill the required amount of topdressing for wheat and base fertilizer for early rice.

    抓五关战六害　争取更大跃进
    孝感向湖北全省发起粮食高产竞赛
    本报武汉24日电　湖北省孝感县高举“高产更高产，跃进再跃进”的大红旗，决心在今年实现全县平均亩产粮食五千斤。他们的战斗口号是：一季（夏收作物，包括早稻）赶全年（1958年），全年翻一番，誓夺全省水稻第一名。
    1958年，孝感县的粮田面积共七十二万亩，总产量十五亿斤左右，由1957年的粮食千斤县一跃而为双千斤县。最近，孝感县举行了全县生产队以上党组织书记和行政、技术干部会议，提出今年总产达到三十二点五亿斤，平均亩产五千斤。总产和单产都比去年翻一番还拐个大弯，即增产一倍还多。棉花三万亩，亩产皮棉五百斤。
    孝感县在经过鸣放辩论制订今年的更大跃进规划时，充分估计了今年更为有利的形势和条件：党对农业生产的领导比以往任何一年都要抓得早、抓得紧、抓得好。在物资准备方面，全县各项作物已普遍使用良种，种籽储备量比去年增加两三倍；由于去年粮棉大丰收，各公社和生产队的生产资金储备也很雄厚；以及人民生活水平的进一步提高，更加激发了群众更大跃进的干劲等。所有这些，再加上人民公社的巨大优越性将进一步发挥和去年农业大跃进经验的运用，就为今年取得更大跃进提供了基本保证。
    在总结去年粮食生产经验教训和进一步贯彻好“八字宪法”的基础上，该县提出“抓五关、战六害，保证水稻穗多刁大颗粒饱满”的新的技术措施。抓五关：一是季节关，适当提前播种。根据当地的气候条件，总的要求“早稻不栽五月秧，双晚不栽八月秧”。二是壮秧关，早晚稻根据一百万苗的要求培育壮秧。三是深耕关，采用套犁、机耕等办法，水稻普遍深耕达到七寸至一尺，精耕细作，做到田平泥烂。四是肥料关，要求每亩施肥一千五百至二千担，折合豆饼一千斤左右，做到底肥充足、混合施肥、分层施肥和分期追肥，让作物吃饱吃好。五是密植关，要求每亩十万兜、百万穗，每穗八十至一百五十粒。此外，加强作物的田间管理，大战病、虫、草、水、旱、倒伏等六害，保证作物安全成长，达到穗多、刁大、粒饱。
    为了实现今年更大跃进的规划，孝感县委正在全县范围内开展以技术革新为中心的群众性生产竞赛运动。一，要求各级领导做到政治挂帅，不断地克服右倾保守情绪，系统地建立起一套科学管理农业技术的组织。二，发动群众从总结1958年生产入手，采取大鸣大放大辩论的办法，层层制订今年的更大跃进规划和具体技术措施；同时，采取办技术训练班等办法，使各项技术措施在广大群众中生根。三，在每一个生产环节上，有计划有目的地发现和培养典型，组织参观评比，开现场会议，促进技术革新运动一个高潮接一个高潮。四，开展高工效运动，保证劳动生产效率翻一番。
    最近，孝感县已经向全省各县发起争取粮食更高产的挑战竞赛。这个县提出要坚决地打好第一个战役，实现“一季赶全年”，全县二十五万亩小麦，力争亩产千斤，全县三十万亩早稻保证亩产三千五百斤，争取创造十万亩高产田亩产达万斤。为了确保小麦、早稻等作物大丰收，各人民公社和管理区、生产队之间，以及社员与社员之间，广泛地展开了劳动竞赛。当前，全县组织了十五万多人的积肥队伍，上山下湖，广开肥源，超额完成小麦追肥和早稻底肥需用量。
