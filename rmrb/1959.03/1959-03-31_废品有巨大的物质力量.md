Scrap steel recovered in Shanghai this year can build five thousand tractors; waste cloth and paper can be made into paper to print 250 million copies of newspapers.

(According to a report from the Liberation Daily) In order to provide grain and fodder for industry, the Shanghai Municipal Waste Material Recycling Department is currently carrying out mass waste material recovery work throughout the city. Since the first quarter of this year, 180 state-owned store recycling stations and purchasing stations, 189 mobile acquisition teams, and more than 660 neighborhood residents have participated in amateur recycling work.

Due to the further development of mass acquisition work, the achievements of Shanghai's waste material recycling work are also greater than in previous years. Looking only at the waste material company system, more than 35 million yuan of waste material was directly recovered in the first quarter of this year alone. This figure is more than double that of the same period last year, equivalent to increasing the production of more than 83,000 tons of raw materials for industrial departments. Many seemingly insignificant old and discarded items and production scraps have now become extremely useful industrial raw materials after centralized processing by the waste material recycling department. For example, the scrap steel acquired this year, if all used to manufacture tractors, could produce more than 5,000 units; the waste cloth and paper acquired, if all processed into newsprint, could print 250 million copies of the Liberation Daily. In addition, things like floating oil in leftover soup and food waste in sewers, which are usually the most overlooked, but after being concentrated and refined by the waste material recycling department, more than 10,000 jin of industrial oil have been extracted in the first quarter of this year alone. If all these oils are supplied to soap factories, more than 1.2 million bars of soap can be produced.

Due to the large-scale recycling and utilization of waste materials, the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in many industrial production departments in the city has been alleviated to a certain extent. Because the waste material company supplied a large amount of waste paper to paper mills to replace wood pulp, the raw material difficulties of these factories were basically resolved, and as a result, the completion of production plans was also guaranteed. Recently, the waste material company has also extracted a large amount of crystalline sodium sulfate from the waste liquid in the sewers, supporting many chemical plants and glass factories.

    废品有巨大的物质力量
    上海今年已经收购的废钢铁可造五千台拖拉机；收购的破布废纸造出纸张可印二亿五千万份报纸。
    据解放日报消息　上海市废品回收部门为了替工业增粮备草，目前正在全市范围内开展群众性的废品回收工作。今年第一季度以来，全市有一百八十个国营门市回收站和代购站、一百八十九个流动收购组、有六百六十多个里弄居民参加了业余回收工作。
    由于群众性收购工作进一步的发展，上海市废品回收工作的成绩也比往年都大。仅就废品公司系统来看，今年第一季度就直接回收了三千五百多万元废料。这个数字比去年同期增长了一倍以上，相当于给工业部门增产了八万三千多吨原料。许多看来微不足道的残旧物品和生产下脚，经过废品回收部门的集中处理，现在都已成了极为有用的工业原料。比如，今年收购起来的废钢铁，如果全部用来制造拖拉机，就可生产五千多台；收购起来的破布废纸，如果全部加工成白报纸，就可印制解放日报二亿五千万份。此外如流失在阴沟中的残汤剩菜中的浮油等，平时是最不被人重视的，但是经过废品回收部门集中提炼，仅今年第一季度就提取了上万斤的工业油脂，假使把这些油脂全部供应肥皂工厂，就可增产出一百二十余万块肥皂。
    由于废品的大量回收利用，全市不少工业生产部门的原材料不足的困难是得到了一定程度的减轻。由于废品公司供应给造纸厂大量废纸代替了木浆，使这些厂的原料困难基本上得到解决，结果完成生产计划也有保证。最近以来废品公司还从阴沟的废液当中提取了大量的结晶硫酸钠，支援了许多化工厂和玻璃工厂。
