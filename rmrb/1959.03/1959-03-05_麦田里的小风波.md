    A Minor Incident in the Wheat Field
    Recently, in the Yanggong Production Team of the Suicheng Commune in Xushui County, Hebei Province, the women's group led by Women's Federation Director Wang Xiuying launched a competition with the men's group led by young Communist Party member Chen Qingtan during the crucial wheat greening stage. After three days of evaluation, Chen Qingtan's group fell behind. They had not yet completed the second application of manure to the wheat, while Wang Xiuying's group had already started the third application. Chen Qingtan became agitated and discussed with his group members, saying, "Tonight, while they are sleeping, let's launch a surprise attack and surpass them no matter what!" "Let's do it!" the young men said in unison.
    Around twelve o'clock that night, the commune members, who had been working hard all day, were fast asleep. At this time, Xiuying was still awake, thinking about the competition. Suddenly, she heard footsteps outside. She thought: someone might be up to something. She quickly woke up the girl Zhao Xiurong next to her. The two put on their clothes and quietly sneaked to the door facing the street, squatting in the corner of the wall. Looking closely, they saw that it was Chen Qingtan leading a group of young men, carrying baskets and hoes, heading to the fields. Xiuying was about to step forward to speak when Xiurong grabbed her and whispered a few words in her ear. Then, the two left.
    Chen Qingtan led his group members to the wheat field and started working vigorously. After only carrying three loads of manure, they suddenly saw Team Leader Chen Hongzhi running over breathlessly, saying, "Qingtan! Who told you to add a night shift and work casually? Go back to sleep and show your strength tomorrow! You can't just rely on hard work in a competition, you also have to use your brains and work cleverly." The team leader had heard Xiuying's report and came specifically to stop them. Seeing the situation was not good, Qingtan led everyone back to sleep.
    Xiuying and Xiurong returned to the room, laughing heartily, waking up several girls in the same courtyard. Xiuying discussed with everyone and decided to get up early the next day and help Qingtan's group apply manure, so that they could also complete their task ahead of schedule. While it was still quite dark, Xiuying called her group members to the wheat field of Qingtan's group and immediately started working. After a while, just before the work bell was about to ring, Qingtan led his entire group, flying as if they had wings, to the manure pile in the wheat field. "Hey! No wonder you're in the lead, you're stealing our manure!" Qingtan saw Xiuying and her group carrying manure and questioned them angrily. Xiuying and her group members giggled. The members of Qingtan's group were even more angry, saying all at once, "You still have the nerve to laugh, if we were as unreasonable as you, we would have finished applying manure eight times over." Hearing this, the girls knew that Qingtan's group had misunderstood them. Xiuying and Xiurong, who usually loved to joke, deliberately pretended to be serious and said, "To tell you the truth, we didn't come to steal manure, the team leader instructed us to do this." Hearing this, Qingtan trembled with anger, fire and smoke rising in his throat: "Why is that?" As he spoke, he ran to find the team leader to reason with him.
    Qingtan ran to the team leader's courtyard in one breath, and upon seeing the team leader, he immediately asked, "Team leader! Tell me, why did you tell Xiuying to use our manure?" The team leader was a little confused by Qingtan's question and was a little embarrassed. Suddenly, he saw someone waving at the door, so he went out. The team leader went out and saw Xiuying and Xiurong. He quickly asked what was going on. Xiuying and Xiurong told him the whole story. The team leader breathed a sigh of relief and immediately ran to Qingtan, saying to him, "Qingtan, Xiuying and the others went to help you spread manure this morning, why are you still angry?" Hearing the team leader say this, Qingtan was taken aback, and all the anger in his stomach dissipated like the gas being released from a gas lamp. When Qingtan returned to the wheat field and took a look, the second application of manure had already been completed. His group and Xiuying's group had both started the third application.

    麦田里的小风波
    河北徐水县遂城公社沿公生产队，在最近大攻小麦返青关当中，由妇联主任王秀英领导的妇女小组，跟青年党员陈清潭领导的男子小组，开展了竞赛。三天的评比结果，陈清潭小组落了后，他们小麦二次盖粪还没完成，王秀英小组已开始盖三次粪了。这下陈清潭可上了火，跟组员们商量说：“今天夜间，趁她们睡觉的时候，咱来个夜战马超，非超过她们不可！”“就这么办！”几个小伙子异口同声地说。
    这天夜间十二点左右，苦干了一天的社员们都已熟睡了。这时，秀英还没睡着，正想着竞赛的事。忽然听到外边有人走路的声音，她想：可能有人在捣什么鬼。忙推醒身旁的姑娘赵秀荣。两人穿上衣服，悄悄地溜到临街的门口，蹲在墙角下。仔细一看，原来是陈清潭带着一群小伙子，拿着筐铣下地了。秀英刚要上前说话，被秀荣一把拉住，咬着秀英的耳朵说了几句话，两人就走了。
    陈清潭带着组员到麦田里，就使劲地干了起来。刚抬了三回粪，突然见队长陈洪志气喘喘地跑来说：“清潭！谁叫你们随便加夜班干活，快回去睡觉，有劲明天施展吧！搞竞赛不能光凭死干，也得动脑筋巧干才行。”队长原来是听了秀英报的信，特赶来阻拦他们。清潭一看情形不妙，就领着大家回去睡觉了。
    秀英和秀荣回到屋里，哈哈笑了一阵，把同院的几个姑娘惊醒了。秀英就和大家商量，决定明天提早起来，去帮助清潭小组盖粪，让他们也提前完成任务。天还挺黑的，秀英就把组员们叫起来，到清潭小组的麦田里，马上干了起来。过了一会，快打上班钟的时候，清潭带领着全组的人，飞也似地来到麦田里的粪堆前。“嘿！怪不得你们占上游，偷使我们的粪呀！”清潭见了秀英她们在抬粪，就气呼呼地责问。秀英和组员们听了，都咯咯地笑了起来。清潭小组的组员们更生气了，七嘴八舌地说：“还有脸笑，我们要像你们这样无理，早就完成盖八次粪了。”这一说，姑娘们知道清潭小组是误解了她们，平常爱开玩笑的秀英和秀荣，就故意装作一本正经地说：“不瞒你说，这不是我们来偷粪，是队长指示我们这样做的。”清潭一听，气得浑身发抖，嗓子里直冒烟火：“这是为什么？”说着就跑去找队长讲理。
    清潭一口气跑到队长的院里，见队长劈头就问：“队长！你给我说说，为什么叫秀英她们用我们的粪？”队长被清潭这一问，有点莫名其妙，正在有点作难。忽然望见门口有人招手，他就出去了。队长出门一看，是秀英和秀荣两个人，忙问是怎么回事。秀英和秀荣就把事情经过说了一遍。队长这才松了一口气，马上跑到清潭跟前，对他说：“清潭，秀英她们今早去帮助你们撒粪，怎么还有气呢？”清潭听队长这一说，吃了一惊，满肚子的气，像气灯拔了气门一样的散失了。等清潭再回到麦田里一看，第二次盖粪早已完成了，他的小组和秀英小组一样，都已开始盖第三次粪了。
