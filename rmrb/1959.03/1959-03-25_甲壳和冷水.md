    Shells and Cold Water
    After being exposed for the tricks it played in its hostile policy towards China, the Kishi Nobusuke government has been trying its best to distort our country's just stance and attack the results of the Japan Socialist Party delegation's visit to China. One Japanese newspaper even said with ulterior motives that China's attitude "will not only force the Kishi government, which has recently wanted to hold intergovernmental negotiations, to once again retreat into the 'shell' of 'wait-and-see,' but also pour cold water on the enthusiasm of the Japanese people to get closer to China."
    It seems that this newspaper wants to win some cheap sympathy for Kishi Nobusuke's unpopular policies. But unfortunately, even the attitude expressed by the Kishi Nobusuke group itself proves that it has never left the "wait-and-see shell." As for the broad masses of the Japanese people, they support the Zhang Xiruo-Asanuma Inejirō Joint Statement and are even more dissatisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke government's continued insistence on a hostile policy towards China. If we are talking about "pouring cold water" on the Japanese people, it is precisely Kishi Nobusuke himself. However, the Japanese people's struggle for Sino-Japanese friendship is boiling with enthusiasm, and Kishi Nobusuke's cold water will be of no avail. (Attached picture)

    甲壳和冷水
    岸信介政府在敌视中国问题上玩弄的把戏被截穿后，竭力歪曲我国的正义立场，攻击日本社会党代表团访问中国的结果。有一家日本报纸，竟然也别有用心地说什么中国的态度“不仅将迫使最近以来想举行政府间的谈判的岸政府再一次逃进‘静观’的‘甲壳’里，并且将对日本国民想接近中国的热意浇以冷水”。
    看来，这家报纸很想替岸信介不得人心的政策骗取一些廉价的同情。但可惜连岸信介集团自己表明的态度，也证明它根本就没有走出过“静观的甲壳”。至于日本广大人民则拥护张奚若—浅沼稻次郎联合声明，更加不满岸信介政府继续坚持敌视中国的政策。如果要说对日本人民“浇冷水”的话，那恰恰是岸信介自己。不过，日本人民争取日中友好的斗争热气沸腾，岸信介的冷水将无济于事。（附图片）
