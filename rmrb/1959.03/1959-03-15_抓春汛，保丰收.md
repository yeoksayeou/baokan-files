    Seize the Spring Fishing Season to Ensure a Bumper Harvest

    This year's first extremely important battle in aquatic production—the spring fishing season production—is about to begin!

    Agricultural production has its summer and autumn harvests. The spring fishing season on the aquatic front is similar in significance to the summer and autumn harvests in agricultural production. During the spring fishing season, economic fish species in the ocean, such as yellow croaker, cuttlefish, and prawns, are highly concentrated, with considerable yields, accounting for about 20% to 30% of the annual marine fishing production. If we do a good job from the beginning of the spring fishing season until the peak fishing season in June, we can strive to complete 60% of the annual marine fishing production task in the first half of the year. This is of vital importance for ensuring the supply of non-staple foods in the market, improving people's lives, ensuring export needs, and supporting national construction.

    The conditions for striving for an unprecedented bumper harvest in the spring fishing season are fully present. According to reports from various regions, the climate is warmer this spring, and the fishing season is arriving earlier. So far, the production situation in various regions is better than in the same period last year. Moreover, some economic fish species with particularly low yields last year have the potential for a large "outbreak at sea" (appearance of fish schools) this year after a year of resource protection and reproduction. The objective conditions for striving for a bumper harvest are very good. What about the subjective conditions? They are also very good. We have more boats, nets, and tools than in previous years, and we have made advance arrangements for the supply of fishing materials, providing better material preparations for increasing production. We have the rich experience of last year's Great Leap Forward and have created many advanced operating methods. We have the people's communes with their enormous advantages, and especially, we have the soaring enthusiasm of the vast fishermen and all employees on the aquatic front, inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee for a full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. All of this constitutes favorable conditions and reliable guarantees for us to strive for an even greater bumper harvest in this year's spring fishing season.

    Currently, the Party and government leading organs in coastal provinces should seize the urgent opportunity of the spring fishing season, vigorously mobilize the masses, and earnestly do a good job in various preparatory tasks. On each of the larger fishing grounds, it is necessary to organize a fishing season production headquarters led by the Party committee, with the participation of various relevant departments, to grasp the fishing situation, organize collaboration, and direct production. Responsible cadres should go to sea with the boats, personally command the "large army" operations at the front line, strengthen political and ideological work on the battlefield, and strengthen fishing ground command.

    Before large-scale sea production, it is necessary to do a good job in repairing boats and nets, supplying fishing materials, allocating labor and technical forces, and ensuring safety equipment. Aquatic departments, commercial departments, transportation departments, meteorological departments, fishery protection departments, medical departments, and other departments related to fishing season production should cooperate closely and, as far as possible, achieve offshore supply, offshore procurement, and offshore protection and security to ensure that fish goods do not deteriorate, that the supply of production and living materials is adequate, and that safety is maintained in offshore production.

    The fishing season is the peak production season on the fishing front, characterized by urgent timing, concentrated fish goods, and a large number of fishing boats and personnel. Organizing and leading this battle well, and achieving a greater and better bumper harvest in the spring fishing season, is not only a huge production task but also a glorious political task. All employees on the aquatic front and the vast fishermen in the coastal areas, let us muster greater revolutionary vigor to respond to the State Council's instructions on welcoming a greater bumper harvest in the spring fishing season, and use the greater bumper harvest in the spring fishing season to promote a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the aquatic front throughout the year.

### 抓春汛，保丰收

    抓春汛，保丰收
    今年水产生产的第一个极其重要的战役——春汛生产就要到来了！
    农业生产上有夏收和秋收，春汛在水产战线的意义恰似农业生产上的夏收和秋收。春汛期间海洋中的经济鱼类如黄花鱼、墨鱼、对虾等相当集中，产量相当大，约占全年海洋渔捞产量的20％到30％。从春汛开始，到6月份的捕捞生产旺季，搞得好，上半年可以争取完成全年海洋捕捞生产任务的60％。这对保证市场副食品的供应，改善人民生活和保证出口需要，支援国家建设，都有十分重要的意义。
    争取春汛空前大丰收的条件是充分存在的。据各地反映，今年春季气候较暖，渔汛来得较早，截至目前为止，各地生产情况比去年同期为好，且去年有些产量特低的经济鱼类，经过一年来的资源保护和繁殖，今年有大量“发海”（出现鱼群）的可能，争取丰收的客观条件是很好的。主观条件怎样呢？也好得很。我们有比往年更多的船网工具，并提前安排了渔需物资的供应，为增加生产提供了较好的物质准备；我们有去年大跃进的丰富经验和创造了许多先进作业方法；我们有了具有巨大优越性的人民公社，特别是我们有了党中央发出农林牧副渔全线大革命的伟大号召后所鼓舞起来的广大渔民和水产战线上全体职工的冲天干劲。这一切都是我们争取今年春汛更大丰收的有利条件和可靠保证。
    当前，沿海各省党政领导机关应该紧紧抓住春汛这个紧急时机，大力发动群众，切实作好各项准备工作。在各个较大的渔场上都要组织有党委挂帅的、吸收各个有关部门参加的渔汛生产指挥部，掌握渔情、组织协作、指挥生产。负责干部要随船出海，亲临前线指挥“大兵团”作战，加强战场政治思想工作，加强渔场指挥。
    大规模出海生产之前，一定要作好船网修补、渔需物资供应、劳动与技术力量调配、安全设备等工作，与渔汛生产有关的水产部门、商业部门、运输部门、气象部门、护渔部门、医药部门等进行密切合作，并且尽可能地做到出海供应、出海收购、出海进行防护保安，以保证鱼货不变质、生产和生活资料供应无缺和海上生产的安全。
    渔汛期是捕渔战线上的生产旺季，它具有时机紧急、鱼货集中、渔船和人员众多等特点。组织好与领导好这场战役，取得春汛更大更好的丰收，不仅是一个巨大的生产任务，也是一个光荣的政治任务。水产战线上的全体职工和沿海广大渔民，让我们鼓起更大的革命干劲，来响应国务院关于迎接春汛更大丰收的指示，用春汛的更大丰收来促进全年水产战线的更大更好更全面的跃进。
