Competing for High Steel Output and Quality, See Whose Hands Hold the Red Flag
    Shanxi and Zhejiang Steel Workers Respond to Broadcast Rally Call and Throw Themselves into Fiery Battle
    (Our Taiyuan dispatch, March 20th) The National Broadcast Rally for High Production and Quality in the Steel Industry has ignited the revolutionary enthusiasm of steelworkers in Shanxi Province, greatly promoting the ongoing "Three Highs" (high output, high quality, high efficiency) red flag competition. The province's steel and iron production levels have rapidly increased.
    After listening to the National Broadcast Rally for High Production and Quality in the Steel Industry on the 16th, over 160,000 steelworkers in the province revised their targets based on the spirit of the rally and formulated new measures to ensure the over-fulfillment of the first quarter's plan. After the National Broadcast Rally for High Production and Quality in the Steel Industry, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company saw nearly a thousand production and construction teams and groups carry out over a hundred major technical innovations in two days. Workers in the Third Workshop of the Iron Smelting Plant improved smelting operation techniques, and the average output of two small blast furnaces on the 16th and 17th increased by a factor of one compared to the 15th. Workers in Class A of the Third Steelmaking Plant smelted fifteen more heats of steel in seven hours on the 16th, with a 100% qualification rate, setting a new high-production, high-quality record since the factory was established. Workers at the Taiyuan Gujiao Iron and Steel Plant proposed to strive for increased blast furnace utilization to ensure the production of 100,000 tons of pig iron this year. On the 16th, the 55-cubic-meter blast furnace in the Henan Iron Smelting Workshop increased its utilization coefficient from 0.82 on the 15th to 0.95. More than 1,500 workers at the Linfen Iron and Steel Plant resolved to raise the red flag of high output and high quality even higher and strive for a bumper harvest in steel production. Workers in the Iron Smelting Workshop also put forward many new measures to ensure the early completion of the state's pig iron plan for March on the 27th. The No. 1 blast furnace in this workshop set a new record of 120 tons per day, with its utilization coefficient increasing from 0.34 to 1.18. Workers at the Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant proposed to increase this year's pig iron production plan from the original 200,000 tons to 230,000 tons, guaranteeing the completion of the leap forward plan of 70,000 tons of steel ingots, 40,000 tons of steel products, and 30,000 tons of refractory materials. Recently, they also summarized experiences in iron smelting technology management. Workers in the Steelmaking Workshop used old equipment and scrap materials to build ten 0.5-ton small converters and put them into production on the same day after listening to the broadcast rally.
    According to statistics, before and after the broadcast rally, the average daily output of pig iron in the province began to rise steadily. The average daily output of pig iron from March 10th to 14th increased by more than 200 tons compared to March 6th to 9th, and the average daily output from March 15th to 17th increased by another 100 tons compared to March 10th to 14th.

    (Our Hangzhou dispatch) After listening to the National Broadcast Rally for High Production and Quality in the Steel Industry, workers on the steel front in Zhejiang Province stated that they would resolutely respond to the rally's call and quickly launch a red flag competition movement centered on breaking through the high-sulfur barrier and improving quality. At the Hangzhou Banshan Iron and Steel Plant, the largest steel plant in Zhejiang Province, 2,500 people listened to the broadcast. Fang Zhisan, the foreman of the 28-cubic-meter small blast furnace, immediately stated that he would learn from the Benxi Iron and Steel Plant and strive to catch up with Benxi. The steelworkers of Shaoxing County, who had already completed 92.69% of their monthly pig iron production plan by the 15th, sent a telegram to the Beijing broadcast rally, determined to make steel production even higher and the quality even better. Chen Caigen, deputy foreman of the No. 6 blast furnace at the Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant, said that although the No. 6 furnace had only been in operation for three days, we are determined to make it a high-yield, high-quality furnace.
    The female warriors of the March 8th blast furnace in the Iron Smelting Workshop of the Xianlinbu Iron and Steel Plant immediately took action after listening to the broadcast rally. Because they more strictly mastered the operation and formula, the sulfur content of pig iron decreased from 0.064% on the 14th to 0.047% on the 17th.
    Workers in coking plants everywhere are also full of energy and confidence. After listening to the broadcast, the workers of the Hangzhou Jianggan Coking Plant held a series of meetings, carefully calculating accounts and arranging tasks, determined to ensure the completion of the March coking task. Originally, this plant could only load three kilns a day, but this time they decided to adjust the labor organization and implement a two-shift production system to strive to load five kilns every day.

    争钢铁高产高质　看红旗握在谁手
    山西、浙江钢铁战士响应广播大会号召投入火热战斗
    本报太原20日电　全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会，激发了山西省钢铁职工的革命干劲，大大推动了正在开展的高产量高质量高效率的“三高”红旗竞赛运动，全省钢和铁的生产水平迅速增长。
    16日，全省十六万多钢铁职工收听了全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会广播后，纷纷根据大会精神修订了指标，制订了新的措施，保证第一季度计划超额完成。太原钢铁公司在全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会以后，全公司近千个生产、建设队和小组两天内就进行了一百多项重大的技术革新。炼铁厂第三车间的工人改进了冶炼操作技术，两个小型高炉16日和17日平均产量比15日猛增一倍。第三炼钢厂甲班工人16日七个小时又吹炼了十五炉钢，钢的合格率达到百分之百，创造了建厂以来的高产优质新纪录。太原古交钢铁厂职工为确保今年生产十万吨生铁提出向提高高炉利用系数进军。16日，河南炼铁车间五十五立方公尺高炉，利用系数由15日的零点八二提高到零点九五。临汾钢铁厂一千五百多名职工决心更高地举起高产优质红旗力争钢铁生产大丰收。炼铁车间职工还提出许多新措施，确保在27日提前完成3月份国家生铁计划。这个车间一号高炉创造了日产一百二十吨的新纪录，利用系数由过去零点三四提高到一点一八。阳泉钢铁厂职工提出今年的生铁产量计划由原来的二十万吨提高到二十三万吨，保证完成七万吨钢锭，四万吨钢材和三万吨耐火材料的跃进计划。最近他们又总结出了有关炼铁技术管理方面的经验。炼钢车间职工利用旧设备和废料建成了零点五吨的小转炉十座，并且在收听广播大会广播后的当天投入了生产。
    据统计，广播大会前后，全省生铁平均日产量就开始节节上升。3月10日至14日比6日至9日平均日产生铁增加了二百多吨，15日至17日又比10日至14日平均日产量增加了一百吨。
    本报杭州电　浙江省钢铁战线职工在收听了全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会广播以后，纷纷表示坚决响应大会号召，迅速掀起一个以突破高硫关、提高质量为中心内容的红旗竞赛运动。浙江省最大的钢铁厂杭州半山钢铁厂，有二千五百人收听了广播。二十八立方公尺小高炉炉长方治三，当场表示要向本溪钢铁厂学习，奋力追赶本溪。到15日已经完成生铁生产月计划92.69％的绍兴县钢铁战士，打电报给北京广播大会，决心要使钢铁的产量更高，质量更好。绍兴钢铁厂六号高炉副炉长陈才根说，六号炉开炉虽然只有三天，但我们有决心使它成为高产优质炉。
    闲林埠钢铁厂炼铁车间三八高炉女战士，收听了广播大会后，立即行动，由于她们更加严格地掌握了操作和配方，使生铁含硫量由14日的0.064％降低到17日的0.047％。
    各地炼焦厂职工也干劲冲天，信心百倍。杭州江干炼焦厂职工在收听广播后，举行了一连串会议，算细账、排任务，坚决保证完成3月份炼焦任务。本来这个厂一天只能装三窑，这次他们决定调整劳动组织实行两班制生产，争取每天装五窑。
