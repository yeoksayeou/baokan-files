(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 29th) A massive technical revolution movement is rapidly unfolding on Shanghai's industrial front. This is a major characteristic of the current high tide of industrial production in Shanghai. The announcement of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and the call for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, ignited the fire of the technical revolution movement of Shanghai's million workers this year. During the Spring Festival, the broad masses of workers and staff spent their time pondering technical revolution initiatives; after the Spring Festival, hundreds of thousands of big-character posters with technical revolution as the main content appeared in factories. In late February, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference put forward a grand leap forward plan for the city's industrial production this year, further inspiring and organizing the drive and determination of the broad masses of workers and staff to seize even greater leap forward achievements. The gongs and drums of the leap forward, the battle letters of competition, and the good news of innovation constitute a turbulent, vigorous, magnificent, and flourishing new situation on the city's industrial front this spring.

This year, the speed of Shanghai's industrial leap forward is unprecedented. Without increasing the number of people, the total output value will increase by 55%, and labor productivity will increase by 40% to 50%. Faced with these ambitious goals, the broad masses of workers and staff, who proposed more than 470,000 innovation suggestions last year, have an even greater drive and bolder style in the technical field. Since the beginning of the year, trailblazers have emerged on all industrial fronts in the city. Peng Dasheng, a young lathe operator at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, took the lead in advocating doing fifteen years of work in one year. Young workers, older workers, and advanced producers in large and small factories such as the Huatong Switch Factory and the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, all proposed to complete the workload of two, three, five, or even ten people this year through a major technical revolution. Li Fuxiang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a worker at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, implemented thirty technical innovation projects last year, increasing production efficiency by one to one hundred times respectively; in the first two months of this year, he proposed another twenty-eight suggestions, of which four, including the improvement of drill bits, have been implemented, increasing production efficiency by three to ten times respectively. These four improvements can save more than 4,000 work hours throughout the year, equivalent to two years of work for one person. Even in the foundry industry, which has always been considered a "low-yield crop," a dark horse has emerged. Yu Zhengyuan, a molding worker at the Shanghai Motor Factory, has achieved a major innovation, increasing production efficiency by five times. He proposed a plan: to do ten years of work in one year, and one person to equal ten people.

Judging from the developments in the past two months, the technical revolution and technical innovation carried out by the broad masses of workers and staff in order to rapidly improve labor productivity are mainly focused on reforming technology, reforming product structure design, and improving equipment, but the scale and momentum this year are even greater than last year. The broad masses of workers and staff have put forward a large number of major reform proposals and conquered difficult technical fortresses. In terms of improving equipment, it has developed from generally improving machine tools and manufacturing simple special-purpose equipment to vigorously promoting mechanization and automation. This is particularly common in industries such as steel rolling, foundry, machining, motor manufacturing, enamel, glass, and thermos bottles; especially in steel rolling factories and mechanical and electrical factories manufacturing the six major equipment for mining, coal washing, and coking, considerable results have already been achieved. The foundry industry, which has the most manual operations, was the first to launch a mechanization and semi-mechanization competition. Nearly two hundred factories are striving to get rid of heavy manual operations and provide better castings for the manufacture of the six major equipment. Among them, workers in various wood mold factories have already abandoned their saws and planes, and more than twenty processes have adopted mechanical operation, with production efficiency increasing several times. Ding Xingqing, a young lathe operator at the Huatong Switch Factory, modified the first electrically controlled automatic lathe at the beginning of the year, breaking the superstition that lathes could not be automated. As a result, many lathe operators in the city have risen up to revolutionize the handle and realize button-operated control, creating conditions for one person to manage multiple lathes. In terms of reforming technology, many reforms of great value have also emerged this year. The Shanghai Turbine Factory, mainly responsible for by technician Wu Ruichang, successfully tested a new method of manufacturing blades by hot rolling and cold drawing at the end of February. This major reform has great economic value. Originally, manufacturing blades by cutting required more than twenty processes, and the utilization rate of alloy steel materials was only 20%. Using the hot rolling and cold drawing method requires only three processes, the production efficiency is increased several times, and the material utilization rate reaches 80%, and the quality is also better. Reforming product structure design is also becoming more and more widespread. The China Automatic Telecommunications Equipment Factory, which simplified the structure of the magneto telephone exchange last year, making the output jump by 106 times, spent another eight days this year reforming the more complex common battery telephone exchange, reducing the number of parts from more than 7,300 to more than 1,500, and saving 80% of raw materials. Everyone at the China Textile Machinery Factory participated in the design, and each workshop created new types of looms.

In this year's technical revolution movement, the broad masses of engineering and technical personnel have played an even greater active role. At this year's leap forward mobilization meetings in various industries and factories, they and the workers took to the stage together and put forward their own leap forward plans. Engineering and technical personnel in the machinery industry held a mobilization meeting, determined to work with the workers to trial-produce more than 400 new products, and further advance in the direction of heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products. This year, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory will trial-produce 28 types of high-efficiency, precision, cutting-edge, and large-scale machine tools. At present, the engineering and technical personnel of the entire factory are working with the workers to carry out the design of nine types of machine tools at the same time. Since the beginning of this year, the engineering and technical personnel of the entire factory have completed the design of two large new products, the external cylindrical grinder and the roll grinder. Many engineering and technical personnel from factories and scientific research institutions have gone to factories and workshops, studying and creating together with the workers next to the machine tools, and have completed many major reforms.

    大搞机械化、自动化　要新产品、要高效率
    上海百万职工猛攻技术堡垒
    本报上海29日电　一个声势浩大的技术革命运动，正在上海工业战线上迅速展开。这是当前上海工业生产高潮的重要特征。党的八届六中全会公布钢煤粮棉四大指标和发出的更大更好更全面跃进的号召，点燃了今年上海百万职工技术革命运动之火。春节期间，广大职工群众就是在琢磨技术革命的创议中度过的；春节过后，以技术革命为主要内容的数十万张大字报在工厂中出现了。2月下旬，中共上海市委工业会议提出今年全市工业生产的宏伟跃进规划，把广大职工群众夺取更大跃进果实的干劲和钻劲，进一步鼓舞和组织起来。跃进的锣鼓、竞赛的战书、革新的捷报，构成了今春全市工业战线上一个翻江倒海、生龙活虎、气象万千、百花怒放的新局面。
    今年，上海工业大跃进的速度空前。在不增加人的条件下，总产值将提高55％，劳动生产率要提高40％到50％。面对着这些宏伟目标，曾经在去年提出四十七万多件革新建议的广大职工，在技术领域中的闯劲更大，敢想敢说敢做的风格更高了。年初以来，全市各条工业战线闯将辈出。上海锅炉厂青年车工彭大生，首先倡议一年做十五年的工作。华通开关厂、上海柴油机厂等大小工厂的青年工人、老年工人、先进生产者，都提出要通过大闹技术革命，在今年内一人完成二人、三人、五人、甚至十人的工作量。全国人民代表大会代表、上海锅炉厂工人李福祥，去年实现了三十项技术革新项目，使生产效率分别提高一倍到一百倍；今年头两个月中又提出二十八项建议，其中已实现的改进钻头等四项，分别提高生产效率三倍到十倍。这四项改进全年可节约四千多个工时，相当于一人两年的工作量。甚至在一向认为是“低产作物”的翻砂行业中，也异军突起，上海电机厂造型工郁正元实现了重大革新，把生产效率提高五倍。他提出规划：一年做十年的活，一人抵上十人。
    从两个多月来发展的形势看，广大职工群众为了迅速提高劳动生产率而进行的技术革命和技术革新，主要还是从改革工艺、改革产品结构设计和改进设备等方面着手，但是今年的规模声势比去年更大了。职工群众提出大量的重大改革的倡议，攻下了艰巨的技术堡垒。在改进设备方面，已经从一般地改进机床、制造简易专用设备，发展到大搞机械化自动化。这在轧钢、翻砂、机械加工、电机制造、搪瓷、玻璃、热水瓶等行业中，尤为普遍；特别是轧钢工厂和制造采矿、洗煤炼焦等六大设备的机电工厂，已经收到不小的效果。手工操作最多的翻砂行业，最早展开机械化半机械化竞赛，近两百个工厂正努力摆脱笨重的手工操作，为制造六大设备提供更好的铸件。其中各木模工厂的工人已经丢掉手里的锯子和刨子，二十多道工序都已采用机械操作，生产效率成倍地增长。华通开关厂青年车工丁杏清，年初改装出第一台电气控制的自动车床，冲破了车床不能自动化的迷信。于是，全市许多车工都纷纷起来革摇手柄的命，实现按电钮操纵，为一人看管多台车床创造条件。在改革工艺方面，今年也出现了不少有重大价值的改革。上海汽轮机厂由技师吴瑞昶主要负责，2月底试验成功了热轧冷拉制造叶片的新方法。这一重大改革具有极大的经济价值。原来用切削方法制造叶片，要经过二十多道工序，合金钢材料的利用率只有20％。用热轧冷拉的方法，只需三道工序，生产效率提高几倍，而且材料利用率到达80％，质量也更好。改革产品结构设计，也越来越广泛了。去年简化磁石式电话交换机的结构，使产量猛跳了一百零六倍的中国自动电讯器材厂，今年又用八天的时间，改革了更复杂的共电式交换机，零件从七千三百多件减少到一千五百多件，原材料节省80％。中国纺织机械厂人人参加设计，各个车间都创造了新型织布机。
    在今年的技术革命运动中，广大工程技术人员发挥了更大的积极性。在今年各个行业各个工厂的跃进誓师大会上，他们和工人同登擂台，提出自己的跃进规划。机械工业工程技术人员举行誓师大会，决心和工人一道试制四百多种新产品，进一步向重型、大型、精密、尖端产品的方向进军。上海机床厂今年要试制二十八种高效率、精密、尖端、大型的机床。目前，全厂工程技术人员正和工人一道，同时进行着九种机床的设计工作。今年以来，全厂工程技术人员已经完成了外园磨床和轧辊磨床两种大型新产品的设计。许多工厂和科学研究机关的工程技术人员，都纷纷下厂下车间，在机床旁边和工人共同研究、共同创造，完成了许多重大的改革。（附图片）
