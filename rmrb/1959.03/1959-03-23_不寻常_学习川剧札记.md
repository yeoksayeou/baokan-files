    Unusual
    ——Notes on Learning Sichuan Opera
    Qiu Yang
    The means by which theatrical artists of the past summarized life were infinitely varied. Although they all aimed to express life and portray characters more accurately, and although they all stemmed from meticulous observation and deep contemplation of life, their focuses and approaches could be vastly different. Watching Sichuan Opera yesterday, I felt this deeply. One can see in "Lan Ma" (拦马, "Stopping the Horse") the ingenious structure of how to combine complex skills with equally complex character relationships; one can also see in "Qiujiang" (秋江, "Autumn River") the remarkable achievement of using the rich movements of Sichuan River boat travel to fully unfold the characters' thoughts. But the most outstanding treatment belongs to "Fan Wang Gong" (梵王宫, "Brahma Palace"). The core of this excerpt is primarily to depict the process of a girl's feelings for a hero arising and developing. The director's handling, which draws on certain traditions, gives this play a rather unusual color.
    There are several details:
    After the girl (Yelü Hanyan) admired the skills and demeanor of the hero who shoots eagles (Hua Yun), she fell in love with him, and he felt the same. So the two stared at each other, which is common on stage. But how to express the depth of their love? This play has an unusual method. The girl's sister-in-law, Yu Shi, comes over to push her, but she doesn't move; calls her, but she doesn't respond. She virtually draws a "thread" in front of Hanyan's eyes, and similarly draws a "thread" in front of Hua Yun's eyes. The two threads become one thread, "tying" them together. When she pulls it, the two people looking at each other move their entire bodies along with it. The thread is naturally not there, and the tying action is also virtual. The audience knows this is fake, but the result makes people feel the depth of their love, and thus feel the truth more intensely!
    Hua Yun leaves, and Hanyan is alone, silently thinking about and imitating his eagle-shooting actions. When she imitates drawing an arrow on the bow, she freezes, lost in thought. Yu Shi comes to call her, but she doesn't answer; fans her, but she doesn't move; pushes her back and forth, but she remains in the pose of drawing an arrow on the bow. Yes, it is an exaggeration, but the girl's deep longing and utter forgetfulness make people see it clearly.
    And the most imaginative thing is the ending: With great difficulty, she is finally awakened from this fantasy and asked to get into the sedan chair. Clearly, it's a sedan carrier with a beard, but in Hanyan's eyes, it's Hua Yun without a beard. The sedan carrier sometimes holds the beard in his mouth, sometimes spits it out and places it under his nose. Although it is clearly seen as a trick, one is convinced. Because here, the girl's infatuation is further depicted in depth, jumping from one fantasy to another, from which one can endlessly imagine her lovesickness.
    There are stage performances that express fantasy; there are also appearances of characters in hallucinations. But like this play, which reflects two different moods in the same person, a method that is both witty and convincing, I have never seen before.
    It is an unusual and outstanding technique, but it cannot be readily transplanted elsewhere, because it not only expresses, in general, the feelings of lovesickness, but more accurately expresses the specific character of a Yuan Dynasty girl like Yelü Hanyan, who has not been influenced by Central Plains customs and is therefore unrestrained in her emotions, and who, because she has been living in seclusion for a long time, can fall in love with a hero at first sight. This can be said to be extreme exaggeration, but it is the result of having deeply observed, studied, and understood real life. Therefore, it seems different from the natural style of life at first glance, but in reality, it expresses the truth of life more accurately and profoundly.
    Life is not art, perhaps this can be used as a small footnote.
    Learning for application, thus I am reminded of spoken drama. Because it is closest to the truth of life, spoken drama naturally has rich expressiveness, but it should also draw some nourishment from this kind of treatment, that is, in order to express life more accurately, it should give full play to imagination, create some brand-new ways of expression with great openness and boldness, unusual, but more accurate.

    不寻常
    ——学习川剧札记
    丘扬
    先辈的戏剧艺术家，概括生活的手段，千变万化，尽管同是为了更准确地表现生活，刻划人物；尽管同是源自对生活的周密观察、深入揣摩；但是着眼处、着手处却可以是大不相同，昨天看川剧，就深有所感。人们可以从“拦马”中，看到如何把复杂的技艺和同样不简单的人物关系结合起来处理的匠心结构；也可以从“秋江”中，看到把丰富的川江行舟动作用于充分展开人物思想的卓越成就；但，更出色的处理，要属“梵王宫”。这一折的中心，主要是刻划一个女孩对一位英雄的感情发生和发展的过程，有所师承的导演处理，却给予这段戏又以颇不寻常的色调。
    有这样几个细节：
    那个女孩（耶律含烟）钦佩于射雕英雄（花云）的身手风貌之后，爱上了他，他也有同感，于是两个人盯住了，这个在舞台上是常见的；但如何表现他俩爱慕之深，这出戏却有个不寻常的方法。女孩的嫂嫂虞氏过来推她，不动；喊她，也不响；她在含烟眼前虚拟地牵过一根“线”，同样地也在花云眼前牵过一根“线”，两线并一线，“拴”在了一起，用手一拽，这两个相视着的人，整个身体，也就随着一动。线，自然是没有的，拴的动作也是虚拟的，观众知道这是在做假，但其结果却使人感到了两人相爱的深度，因而是更集中地感到了真！
    花云走了，含烟一个人默想着比拟着他射雕的动作，比拟到搭箭在弓的时候，忘情地呆住了，虞氏来喊她，不应；搧她，又不动；推来推去，还是那个搭箭在弓的姿式。不错，是夸张，但女孩思慕之深、忘情之甚，却使人清楚地看到了。
    而最最发乎奇想的是结尾：好不容易才把她从这幻想中唤醒，要她上轿的，明明是有胡须的轿夫，在含烟看来是无须的花云。轿夫把胡须忽尔含在口中，忽尔吐置鼻下，尽管明明看到了这是个花样，但却被说服。因为这里是更深入一笔地勾抹了这个少女的痴情，从一个幻想跳入另一个幻想，可以由之无尽地想像到她的相思。
    舞台上表现幻想，有的；出现幻觉中的人物，也是有的；但像这出戏这样，在同一个人身上反映出两个不同的心情，既俏皮又令人信服的手法，在我来说，还是得未曾见。
    是不寻常的、出色的手法，但却不能率尔移植于别一处，因为这里不仅仅是表现，一般的相思之情，特别是更准确地表现，像耶律含烟这样一个未染中原习气因而情致奔放、由于久处深闺因而一见英雄便能倾心的元代少女的具体性格。这可以说是极度的夸张，但这却是由于曾经深入地观察了、研究了、体会了实际生活的结果，因之，乍看似乎和生活的自然样式不一样，实际却是更准确地、更深刻地表现了生活真实。
    生活不就是艺术，也许可以以此做一小小的注脚。
    学以致用，因而联想起话剧。由于最接近生活真实，话剧自然能够具有丰富的表现力，但也应当向这种处理吸取些营养，那就是，为了更准确地表现生活，理当发抒奇想，大开大阖、提得起放得下地创造出一些崭新的表现方式，不寻常，但更准确。
