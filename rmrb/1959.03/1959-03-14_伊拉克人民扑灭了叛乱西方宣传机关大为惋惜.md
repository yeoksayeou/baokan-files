    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th – The victory of the Iraqi people in swiftly quelling the Shawwaf counter-revolutionary rebellion has greatly disappointed those imperialist propaganda organs that were once gleeful. While lamenting and complaining, they have had to admit in frustration to yet another failure.

    An Associated Press dispatch from Beirut on the 11th admitted that the Iraqi Republic government, headed by Prime Minister Kassem, is now "more consolidated than at any time" since its establishment, thanks to the support of the people in suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion. It lamented that this rebellion was "obviously premature and reckless, and planned very poorly." A dispatch from Damascus by the same news agency on the 12th also quoted local "reliable sources" as saying that the rebellion led by Shawwaf "failed" because it was "launched too early." These sources also said that the rebellion would have succeeded if Shawwaf had not been suddenly killed.

    The British "Daily Mail" also expressed regret over the failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Iraq.

    伊拉克人民扑灭了叛乱西方宣传机关大为惋惜
    新华社13日讯　伊拉克人民迅速扑灭沙瓦夫反革命叛乱的胜利，使得那些一度喜形于色的帝国主义宣传机关大失所望，它们在惋惜怨叹之余，已不得不懊丧地承认又一次失败。
    美联社11日从贝鲁特发出的一条消息承认，以卡塞姆总理为首的伊拉克共和国政府在人民支持下镇压了这次反革命叛乱以后，比它成立以来的“任何时候都更加巩固”。它惋惜地说，这次叛乱“显然是不成熟的和卤莽的，而且计划得很不周密”。这家通讯社12日从大马士革发出的一条消息还引当地“可靠人士”的话说，沙瓦夫领导的叛乱“所以失败”，是因为“发动得太早了”。这些人士还说，如果不是沙瓦夫突然被杀死，叛乱本来是会成功的。
    英国的“每日邮报”也对伊拉克反革命叛乱失败表示遗憾。
