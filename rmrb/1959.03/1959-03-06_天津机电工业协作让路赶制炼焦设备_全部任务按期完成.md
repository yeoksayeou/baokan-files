According to the Tianjin Daily: Guided by the thought of "the whole country as a single chessboard," the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Electromechanical Industry and the workers of more than 20 electromechanical factories under its leadership concentrated their main manpower and material resources. After more than 20 days of hard work, they completed the 250 sets of "No. 2" simple coking furnaces and 150 sets of supporting equipment for simple coking furnaces that were uniformly allocated by the state on February 28th, completing the tasks on schedule, with guaranteed quality and quantity.

The task of this batch of coking equipment was assigned by the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in February of this year, requiring all to be completed by the end of February. After the tasks were assigned to more than 20 factories in Tianjin on February 5th and 6th, the workers realized the important role of this batch of equipment in the country's completion of 18 million tons of steel this year. They put forward the battle slogans of "Make contributions to the steel commander!" and "Ensure key construction and complete the task ahead of schedule," and immediately launched a labor emulation campaign. Workers at the Yuzengxiang Casting Iron Factory began to take action on the 30th day of the 12th lunar month, and completed all the castings two days ahead of schedule on February 13th.

Time was tight, the task was urgent, and some raw materials were in short supply for a time, making it difficult to complete this batch of tasks. In order to ensure the completion of key tasks, all factories concentrated the "superior forces" of the factory when arranging plans. Many factories drew out technically skilled workers, vacated the best machines, and actively advanced the stock materials when the raw material supply could not keep up. The Tonghe Copper and Iron Factory stopped producing various gate valves originally produced in the factory, and extracted 19 machine tools to process coking equipment parts, completing the task on schedule.

In the rush to produce this batch of equipment, the broad masses of employees offered advice and suggestions, carried out technical revolutions in a big way, and strived to complete the tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. In just 23 days, all the coking equipment tasks that would have taken more than two months to complete in the past were completed, and the quality was fully qualified.

    天津机电工业协作让路赶制炼焦设备
    全部任务按期完成
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：天津市机电工业局及其领导下的二十多个机电工厂职工，在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，集中了主要的人力、物力，经过二十多天奋战，在2月28日完成了国家统一分配的二百五十套“二号”简易炼焦炉以及一百五十套简易炼焦炉的配套设备，按期、保质、保量地完成了任务。
    这批炼焦设备任务，是在今年2月份由第一机械工业部和冶金工业部统一下达的，要求2月底全部完成。2月5日和6日，任务分别下达到天津市的二十多个工厂以后，工人们认识到这批设备对于全国今年完成一千八百万吨钢的重要作用，提出了“为钢帅立功！”“保证重点建设，提前完成任务”的战斗口号，立刻开展了劳动竞赛。玉增祥铸铁厂工人，在夏历12月30日那天就开始行动，到2月13日提前两天完成了全部铸件任务。
    时间紧，任务急，有些原材料一时又供应不足，完成这批任务是有不少困难的。各厂为了保证重点任务的完成，在安排计划时，都集中了厂里的“优势兵力”。许多厂抽出技术好的工人，腾出最好的机器，原料供应不上的就主动垫出库存的材料。同和铜铁工厂把厂里原来生产的各种闸板停了下来，抽出十九台机床加工炼焦设备部件，按期完成了任务。
    在突击赶制这批设备中，广大职工出谋献策，大搞技术革命，力争任务完成得又多、又快、又好、又省。短短的二十三天，就完成了在过去需要两个多月才能完成的全部炼焦设备任务，而且质量完全合格。
