Mobilizing the Masses to Calculate Living Accounts
Chu Xue

	When making plans, of course, we must calculate accounts. If we don't conduct realistic calculations, the plans we make will definitely lack a realistic foundation. There are two types of accounts: dead accounts and living accounts. Dead accounts include things like how many people there are, how much equipment there is, how many materials there are, and how much can be produced. Living accounts are about what the production situation will be like after bringing human subjective initiative into play. We must calculate both dead and living accounts, but we should focus on calculating living accounts to set advanced production targets.

	The Shanghai Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory discovered great production potential by calculating living accounts. The characteristics of their accounting method are: seeing both things and people; considering both existing conditions and the new conditions that will emerge through human subjective effort; comprehensively analyzing both favorable and unfavorable conditions, making full use of favorable conditions, and doing everything possible to turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. As a result, the potential became greater and greater, and the enthusiasm of the workers became higher and higher. Advanced plans were set, and a new production upsurge was formed.

	The accounting method of the Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory is in line with the principle of combining soaring enthusiasm with the spirit of scientific analysis. What is the spirit of scientific analysis? It is to understand the original appearance of things, find out their objective laws, and further act in accordance with objective reality and objective laws. Since things are constantly developing and changing, since unfavorable conditions can be transformed, and since people are the most active and dynamic factor in production, then, in the process of formulating plans, we must, while analyzing the existing material conditions, also fully consider the subjective initiative of people, actively promote the transformation of unfavorable factors into favorable factors, and create more favorable conditions for the Great Leap Forward. If we only calculate the dead things like equipment and materials in front of us, and do not calculate the huge potential that can be tapped through human effort; if we do not make full use of favorable conditions, and do not actively promote the transformation of unfavorable conditions, this is a metaphysical accounting method, not a truly scientific accounting method.

	The spirit of scientific analysis is both opposed to exaggeration and incompatible with superstition and conservative thinking. To effectively implement the spirit of scientific analysis, we must oppose conservatism, break down superstition, and demand the promotion of vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm. As for advocating realistic calculation, arrangement, and inspection, it is also to better promote the enthusiasm of the masses. Revolutionary enthusiasm is the prerequisite for doing all work well, and promoting the spirit of scientific analysis not only does not hinder the exertion of revolutionary enthusiasm, but also requires more abundant enthusiasm. After the workers of the Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory correctly understood the relationship between soaring enthusiasm and the spirit of scientific analysis, they mustered even greater enthusiasm, so they could actively compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, tap potential, and calculate living accounts, and finally formulate advanced plans.

	The reason why this factory can calculate living accounts so well is also because they fully mobilized the masses and organized all the factory workers to discuss and formulate plans. It often happens that when a few leaders are locked in a room making plans, they tend to see more of the dead conditions and underestimate the production potential. Once the masses are mobilized, everyone uses their brains and everyone offers ideas, the potential will be tapped more and more; difficulties that were originally considered difficult to overcome will also be found ways to overcome. The plans made in this way are advanced and more closely in line with reality.

	The method of mobilizing the masses to calculate living accounts can be used when making annual plans, and it can also be used when making quarterly plans, monthly plans, ten-day plans, and even daily plans. This method is worth promoting.

    发动群众算活账
    楚雪
    订计划，当然要算账。如果不进行切实的计算，订出的计划一定缺乏现实基础。账有两种，一是死账，诸如有多少人、多少设备、多少材料、能生产多少东西等等。一是活账，就是发挥人的主观能动性后，生产的状况将会是怎么样。死账要算，活账更要算，而且应该着重算活账，才能订出先进的生产指标。
    上海杨浦棉纺织印染厂就是经过算活账，发掘出很大的生产潜力。他们的算账方法的特点是：见物又见人；既考虑现有条件，又考虑经过人的主观努力将要出现的新的条件；对有利条件和不利条件进行全面分析，充分利用有利条件，千方百计地化不利条件为有利条件。结果潜力越算越大，职工的干劲越算越高。先进的计划定出来了，新的生产高潮也形成了。
    杨浦棉纺织印染厂的算账方法，符合冲天干劲和科学分析精神相结合的原则。所谓科学分析的精神是什么？就是要弄清事物的本来面目，找出它的客观规律，进一步按照客观实际和客观规律来办事。事物既然是不断发展变化的，不利条件既然可以转化，人既然是生产中的最积极最活跃的因素，那末，在制订计划的过程中，就要在分析现有的物的条件的同时，又要充分考虑到人的主观能动性，积极促使不利因素转化为有利因素，为大跃进创造更加有利的条件。如果只计算眼前的设备、材料等死的东西，不计算经过人的努力可以挖掘出的巨大潜力；对有利条件不知充分利用，对不利条件不积极促使它转化，这是形而上学的算账方法，不是真正科学的算账方法。
    科学分析的精神既同浮夸相对立，又同迷信、保守思想水火不相容。要切实贯彻科学分析的精神，必然要反对保守，破除迷信，必然要求发扬热气腾腾的革命干劲。至于提倡切实的计算、安排和检查，也是为了更好地发扬群众的干劲。革命干劲是搞好一切工作的前提，提倡科学分析的精神不但不妨碍发挥革命干劲，而且要求干劲更加充沛。杨浦棉纺织印染厂的职工在正确理解了冲天干劲和科学分析精神的关系以后，鼓起了更大的热情，因此能积极地比先进，学先进，挖潜力，算活账，终于制定出先进的计划。
    这个厂所以能很好地算活账，还因为他们充分发动了群众，组织全厂职工都来讨论和制定计划。常常有这种情况：当少数领导人员关在房子里订计划的时候，容易对死的条件看得多，对生产潜力估计不足。一旦把群众发动起来，人人动脑，个个献计，潜力就会越挖越大；原来认为难以克服的困难，也会找到克服的办法。这样订出的计划才是先进的，也是更接近和符合实际的。
    发动群众算活账的办法，在订年计划的时候用得着，在订季度计划、月计划、旬计划以至日计划的时候，也都用得着。这种办法值得提倡。
