    Everything for Early Steel Production
    Liu Shuxin, Foreman of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Steelmaking Plant
    The higher-ups told us that the open-hearth furnaces would produce steel in the first half of this year. Everyone was both happy and anxious. Happy because Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation producing steel would increase the country's strength; anxious because they were afraid of not completing the task and affecting the steel production of the open-hearth furnaces. It's been raining these past few days, so what can we do? The higher-ups originally assigned us to build the heavy oil depot and ground pump room, and recently added the construction of the No. 3 substation project. The task is heavy, and the project is particularly complex. A few days ago, cadres above the team leader level held a meeting to discuss it. They all said there was no problem and they would definitely ensure the quality of the project and guarantee that the construction period would not be delayed.
    Like everyone else, I also have this kind of drive. Previously, our group was a carpentry group, and there wasn't much work to be done, but we often had to stop work and be idle. For example, when supporting formwork, if there were reinforcing bars in the way, we could only stare blankly and wait for the welders to come, which affected the progress of the project. Later, we learned technology, and everyone in the group became versatile. When the work was busy, everyone went all out to rush, and they could do any kind of work, so the task was completed quickly and well. In May of last year, when installing pipelines at the No. 5 pumping station opposite No. 1 blast furnace, the pipeline workers only installed four in three days. After our carpentry group learned this technology and cooperated with the pipeline workers, we installed twenty-seven in three days. Everyone said that versatility really solves problems. Now, we have thirty people who are truly versatile. They are carpenters, and also reinforcing steel workers, concrete workers, scaffolders...; Zhang Baoshen, a sixth-grade worker who was transferred with me from the Northeast, has mastered the technology of fifteen types of work.
    This year, the tasks are crowded together and much heavier than last year. Many of the original versatile workers have been transferred away, and a large number of apprentices have been added, so the technical strength is weak, and there are many difficulties. Secretary Zhang of the construction site Party branch called on us to turn the apprentices into technicians as soon as possible, and we all actively responded to the call. I thought: what kind of worker is lacking, then we will train that kind of worker. We started doing this this year, and before the end of April, we will ensure that all apprentices are trained to become second-grade or third-grade workers; in another six months, everyone will become versatile. We are already giving lectures to the apprentices, using models to explain, and they understand as soon as we explain, and they are also worry-free when they work.
    In order to produce steel at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation as early as possible, like repairing No. 1 blast furnace last year, we must find a way to complete the project task ahead of schedule. Our No. 3 substation, the construction site stipulates that it should be completed in fifty days, and we guarantee that it will be completed in thirty days. We have all discussed it. There are now eight master carpenters and more than forty apprentices in the carpentry aspect, plus concrete workers and scaffolders, there are seventy people. The retaining wall, which is three meters and eight centimeters high, and the platform of more than five hundred square meters, are guaranteed to be completed in two days; the task of pouring more than one thousand cubic meters of concrete is also guaranteed to be completed in three days; and there are many other project items that I won't go into detail. Our versatile workers are not afraid of a lot of work, we will go wherever we are needed, and we can do what others can do. Everyone has one heart: everything is for early steel production. We will also realize semi-mechanization in the first half of the year. Carpenters will use electric planers and electric saws, earthmoving workers will use soil loosening machines, and concrete pouring will use mechanical transportation. This will speed up the construction progress and make early steel production more guaranteed. I remember that last year we proposed to repair No. 1 blast furnace ahead of schedule, and the imperialists said we were bragging, but later we really completed the iron production ahead of schedule, giving them a slap in the face. This time, we will also give them a slap in the face. The Chinese working class is powerful, and what it says, it does. I am a Communist Party member, and I know that the task I shoulder is arduous and glorious. No matter how many difficulties there are, I am not afraid, and I will definitely guarantee to complete the task assigned by the Party ahead of schedule.

    一切为了早出钢
    武钢炼钢厂工长　刘树新
    上级告诉我们说，今年上半年平炉要出钢，大伙儿心里又乐又急：乐的是武钢炼出了钢，将给国家增加力量；急的是怕任务完不成，影响平炉出钢。这几天老下雨，这可怎么整？上级原来分配我们负责修重油库和地泵房，最近又加上修三号变电所的工程，任务重了，工程又特别复杂。前几天，班长以上的干部开会讨论，都说没问题，一定保证工程质量，保证不误工期。
    我和大伙一样，也有这股子劲。以前我们小组是个木工组，论活儿的确不多，可就常常要停工窝工，比方支模板一遇上有钢筋挡住，就干瞪眼等焊工来，影响工程进度。后来我们学技术，全组个个都成了多面手，活儿一忙，大家全去突击，不论哪种工种都能干，任务完成得又快又好。去年5月在一号高炉对面五号水泵站安装管道，管道工三天才安了四个，我们木工组学会这门技术以后，同管道工一配合，三天就安了二十七个。大伙都说，多面手真解决问题。现在我们有三十人真正是多面手，是木工，又是钢筋工、混凝土工、架子工……；跟我从东北一同调来的六级工张宝深，已经掌握了十五种工种的技术。
    今年任务挤在一起，比去年重得多。原来的多面手调走了不少，新添了大批徒工，技术力量弱，困难很多。工地党支部张书记号召我们尽快把徒工变成技工，我们都积极响应了号召。我想：缺什么工就培养什么工。今年开始我们就这么干，在4月底以前，保证把徒工都培养成二级工到三级工；再过半年，个个都成多面手。现在已经给徒工讲课，用模型讲，一讲就懂，干起活来也让人省心。
    为了叫武钢早出钢，跟去年修一号高炉一样，一定得想办法提前完成工程任务。我们修的三号变电所，工地规定五十天建成，我们保证在三十天建成。我们大伙合计过，木工方面现在有八位老师傅，四十多名徒工，加上混凝土工、架子工有七十来人，高三公尺八的挡土墙连五百多平方公尺的平台，保证两天搞完；一千多立方公尺混凝土浇灌任务也保证三天搞完；还有许许多多工程项目不一一细说了。我们多面手不怕活多，哪里需要就到哪里，别人能干咱们也能干。大伙一个心：一切为了早出钢。我们还要在上半年实现半机械化，木工要使电刨电锯，挖土工要使松土机，浇灌混凝土利用机械运输，这样施工进度会更快，早出钢就更有把握。记得去年咱们提出提前修好一号高炉，帝国主义者说是吹牛，后来咱们真的提前建成出铁了，打了他们一记耳光。这回还要给他们送一记耳光。中国的工人阶级力量强大，说到做到。我是一个共产党员，我知道担的任务又艰巨，又光荣，困难再多也不怕，党交给的任务一定保证提前完成。
