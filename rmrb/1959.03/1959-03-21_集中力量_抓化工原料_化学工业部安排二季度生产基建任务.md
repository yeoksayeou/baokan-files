Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 19th: The National Chemical Industry Bureau Directors' Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Chemical Industry determined that this year, under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as a single chessboard," China's chemical industry should continue to organize a great leap forward in the chemical industry, resolutely completing and overfulfilling this year's various production targets and capital construction tasks. The conference also specifically arranged production and capital construction tasks for the second quarter.

The conference analyzed the favorable conditions for vigorously developing the chemical industry, believing that in the great leap forward of 1958, Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over the chemical industry, and the whole people running chemical industry had already begun, which created a good foundation for greater leaps forward this year and in the future. Therefore, it is necessary, under the premise of "the whole country as a single chessboard," to concentrate efforts on developing basic raw material industries and the construction of mines producing chemical raw materials, continue to organize great leaps forward, and resolutely complete and overfulfill this year's various production targets and capital construction tasks. The conference particularly emphasized taking care of the overall situation and promoting the spirit of self-denial, requiring all possible efforts to support the realization of the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. In order to ensure the completion of the four major targets, the chemical industry should consciously and appropriately give way when necessary, and promote its own better progress. Therefore, within the chemical industry, priorities should be well-ordered according to their importance and urgency, needs and possibilities. The conference decided that in the first half of the year, the focus should be on developing acids, alkalis, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, organic raw materials, and carrying out mine construction, while in the second half of the year, the focus should be on developing fertilizers and synthetic materials.

The conference pointed out that the chemical industry must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs." According to economic and technical conditions, it should develop both "native" methods and "foreign" methods, as well as the combination of native and foreign methods.

The conference believes that all chemical enterprises must now quickly break away from the task of compiling and revising plans, and focus fiercely on production. In particular, leading personnel must deeply lead production, and launch a mass technical revolution movement centered on improving labor productivity, and tap the potential of enterprises.

This year, capital construction in the chemical industry must first concentrate efforts on storming key projects and small- and medium-sized projects with good conditions and quick results. According to this requirement, the conference also made appropriate adjustments to this year's capital construction projects and construction time.

The chemical industry is a multi-industry and multi-variety industry. Therefore, the conference emphasized that all regions, industries, factories, and mines must cooperate well and support key provinces, cities, factories, and mines in terms of resources and materials; key provinces, cities, and factories should also support all parts of the country technically.

The conference also decided to expand and newly build a number of large-scale pyrite mines, boron mines, and phosphate mines this year to meet the needs of the development of the chemical industry.

    集中力量  抓化工原料
    化学工业部安排二季度生产基建任务
    据新华社南京19日电　化学工业部最近召开的全国化工厅局长会议确定：今年我国化学工业要在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，继续组织化学工业大跃进，坚定不移地完成和超额完成今年各项生产指标和基本建设任务。会议同时具体安排了第二季度的生产和基本建设任务。
    会议分析了大力发展化学工业的有利条件，认为在1958年的大跃进中，各级党委加强了对化学工业的领导，全民办化工已经开始，这为今年和今后更大跃进创造了良好的基础。因此，必须在全国一盘棋的前提下，集中力量发展基本原料工业和生产化工原料的矿山建设工作，继续组织大跃进，坚定不移地完成和超额完成今年各项生产指标和基本建设任务。会议特别强调照顾全局，发扬克己精神，要求千方百计支持钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现。化学工业为了保证四大指标的完成，必要时应该自觉地适当让路，并且促使本身更好地前进。因此，化学工业内部要根据轻重缓急，需要和可能很好地排队。会议决定上半年重点发展酸碱、农药、医药、有机原料和进行矿山建设，下半年重点发展肥料和合成材料。
    会议指出，化学工业必须坚决贯彻两条腿走路的方针。应该根据经济技术条件，既要发展“土”的，也要发展“洋”的和土洋结合的。
    会议认为，各个化工企业目前必须迅速从编制修订计划中摆脱出来，狠狠抓生产，特别是领导人员必须深入领导生产，掀起一个以提高劳动生产率为中心的群众性技术革命运动，挖掘企业潜力。
    今年化学工业的基本建设首先要集中力量突击建设重点工程和条件好见效快的中小型工程。根据这个要求，会议对今年基建项目和建设的时间也作了适当调整。
    化学工业是一个多行业多品种的工业。因此，会议强调指出，各地区、行业、厂矿之间，必须很好进行协作，在资源、材料上支援重点省、市、厂矿；重点省、市、工厂，也要在技术上支援全国各地。
    会议还决定今年扩建新建一批大型硫铁矿、硼矿、磷矿，以适应化学工业发展的需要。
