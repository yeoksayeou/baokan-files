　　The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party has successfully concluded. The Congress warmly discussed the report on the summary of the central work by Comrade Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and also discussed the directives on the development of the national economy of Poland in 1959-1965, the report on the Party's rural policy, and the report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and adopted corresponding resolutions on these reports. A new central leadership, headed by Gomułka, was also elected. This Congress is a major event in the political life of the Polish people. It marks a new period in which the Polish people are entering a new period of great strides forward on the road to building socialism.

　　In the nearly fifteen years since liberation, Poland has undergone the most profound changes in its history. The Polish United Workers' Party has led the Polish people and achieved great victories in socialist construction. Poland has long since transformed from an economically backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. In 1958, Poland's industrial products increased fourfold compared to 1936, agricultural output increased by 30.5% compared to 1949, and national income increased by 1.7 times compared to 1938. All of this fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority and boundless vitality of the socialist system.

　　In recent years, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Gomułka, the Polish United Workers' Party has carried out a series of important tasks and has achieved major successes in defeating domestic reactionary forces, correcting past dogmatic errors, opposing the main danger of revisionism within the Party, strengthening the unity of the Party, and strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, and so on. At the same time, the Polish United Workers' Party has also made important contributions in safeguarding European security and world peace, in strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement, and in opposing modern revisionism and safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

　　The plan for the development of the national economy of Poland in 1959-1965, formulated by this Congress, has opened a new period in Poland's socialist construction and demonstrated the brilliant prospects for Poland's development. The goal of this plan is to continue the country's socialist industrialization, expand productive forces to improve the living standards of the people, and shorten the distance between Poland and the developed capitalist countries of Europe. According to the provisions of this plan, compared with 1958, Poland's industrial products will increase by 80% in 1965, agricultural production will increase by 30%, and the actual wages of workers and the actual income of farmers will increase by 33% to 35%. The seven-year plan stipulates the increase of urban and rural housing construction, the increase of consumer goods production, and the corresponding development of cultural and educational undertakings. All of this guarantees that in the next seven years, the material and cultural living standards of the Polish people will be greatly improved. At the same time, this Congress also determined the Party's rural policy, which is to gradually realize agricultural collectivization while continuously developing agricultural and animal husbandry production. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on promoting Poland's socialist construction. At present, the peaceful economic competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system is entering a new stage. The countries of the socialist camp are accelerating socialist construction with the heroic spirit of surpassing capitalism. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan is the main symbol of this stage. Poland's seven-year plan and the long-term plans for the development of the national economy of other socialist countries are important components of the economic competition between socialism and capitalism.

　　While formulating a plan for the development of the national economy, this Congress emphasized strengthening the Party's leading role in the people's state, strengthening the Party's unity, and strengthening the Party's ideological work. The Polish Party will strengthen the Party's leading role in the people's state by consolidating the national united front, curbing the reactionary political activities of the church, strengthening the socialist legal system, eliminating anti-socialist tendencies and revisionist tendencies on the cultural front, and so on. Comrade Gomułka pointed out that revisionism is currently the greatest danger to the Polish Party. Revisionism abandons the principles of Marxism-Leninism, undermines the unity of the Party and the unity of the socialist camp, and was severely condemned at this Congress. Many representatives stated in their speeches that the resolute struggle against revisionism must continue. This Congress also emphasized that democratic centralism is the main principle of intra-Party life and the condition for the Party's ideological and political unity, and emphasized that the Party's ideological work must be strengthened, the Party's Marxist-Leninist ideological education for the broad masses of the people, especially the ideological education for the younger generation, must be strengthened. All of this will undoubtedly have a profound impact on Poland's socialist construction in the future.

　　This Congress reiterated Poland's peaceful foreign policy in international affairs. As everyone knows, the People's Republic of Poland occupies an important position in the struggle to safeguard European security and world peace. The Rapacki Plan for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, proposed by Poland, has received widespread support from European countries. The German question, which is currently attracting world attention, is closely related to the Polish people. In his report, Comrade Gomułka reiterated Poland's full support for the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and resolve the West Berlin issue, as well as the proposal to convene a high-level meeting to resolve these issues; and emphasized that the security of the German Democratic Republic is the security of Poland, and the security of the German Democratic Republic is defended by the entire socialist camp.

　　This Congress strongly condemned the Adenauer clique's deliberate conspiracy to annex Poland's western territories. The Polish people's claim to defend the western border of their motherland will undoubtedly be supported by all peace-loving people.

　　Imperialism and all reactionaries have never forgotten to undermine the unity of the international communist movement and the unity of the socialist camp, especially the unity of socialist countries with the Soviet Union. Therefore, without exception, they have tried every means to undermine the unity of Poland with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. However, facts have proved that they are wasting their efforts. Comrade Gomułka pointed out in his report that the theory of Marxism-Leninism is the only foundation of the Polish workers' movement. The principles of the joint declaration of the twelve communist and workers' parties of socialist countries adopted in Moscow in November 1957 serve as the basic guidelines for the Polish Party's policies. The Polish United Workers' Party condemned the Yugoslav revisionists' attempt to undermine the unity of the international communist movement. Comrade Gomułka emphasized that: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the basic force of the international communist movement. The Soviet Union is the pillar of this movement and the pillar of all socialist countries." He also pointed out that: fraternal friendship and unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union are the foundation of Poland's policy, and are the basic, solid and permanent factors in Poland's policy. Comrade Gomułka's words expressed the firm will of the Polish people and once again proved that the unity of international communism and the unity of the socialist camp are unbreakable.

　　The Polish United Workers' Party, with its glorious revolutionary tradition and brilliant achievements, is leading the Polish people from one victory to another based on the guidelines for Poland's development formulated by this Congress. Through the convening of this Congress, the Polish United Workers' Party has strengthened the unity of its ranks and the ties between the Party and the masses, strengthened the unity with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strengthened the unity with the international communist movement centered on the Soviet Union. This is a major guarantee for the Polish people to achieve new victories.

　　China and Poland are fraternal countries of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. There is a deep friendship and strong unity between the people of our two countries. Our people are infinitely excited about the great achievements made by the fraternal Polish people in all aspects under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. We warmly congratulate the victory of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party and warmly congratulate the Polish United Workers' Party for leading the Polish people to achieve greater victories in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

    沿着社会主义的大道胜利前进
    波兰统一工人党召开的第三次代表大会胜利闭幕了。这次大会热烈讨论了波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡同志关于中央工作总结的报告，同时还讨论了关于波兰1959—1965年发展国民经济的指示，关于党的农村政策的报告和关于修改党章的报告，并就这些报告通过了相应的决议。并且选出了以哥穆尔卡为首的新的党中央领导机构。这次大会是波兰人民政治生活中的重大事件。它标志着波兰人民正在进入一个在建设社会主义道路上大步前进的新时期。
    在解放后近十五年来，波兰经历了历史上最深刻的变化。波兰统一工人党领导着波兰人民，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的胜利。波兰早已从一个经济落后的农业国家，变成为一个社会主义的工业国家了。1958年，波兰的工业产品比1936年增加了四倍，农业产量比1949年增加了30.5％，国民收入比1938年增加了一点七倍，所有这一切，都充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性和无限生命力。
    最近几年来，在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，波兰统一工人党进行了一系列的重要工作，在战胜国内反动势力，纠正过去的教条主义的错误，反对党的主要的危险修正主义，加强党内的团结和党与群众之间的联系等等方面，获得了重大的成就。同时，波兰统一工人党在保卫欧洲安全和世界和平方面，在加强社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结方面，以及在反对现代修正主义和保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性方面，也作出了重要的贡献。
    这次大会拟订的波兰1959—1965年发展国民经济的计划，打开了波兰社会主义建设的新时期，展现了波兰发展的光辉的前景。这个计划的目标是，继续进行国家的社会主义工业化，扩大生产力，以提高人民的生活水平，缩短波兰同欧洲发达的资本主义国家的距离。按照这个计划的规定，1965年同1958年相比，波兰的工业产品将增加80％，农业生产将增加30％，职工的实际工资和农民的实际收入将增加33％到35％。七年计划中规定要增加城乡住宅建设，增加消费品生产，并且相应地发展文化教育事业。所有这些，都保证在今后七年中，波兰人民的物质和文化生活水平将大大提高。同时，这次大会还确定了党的农村政策，就是在不断发展农牧业生产的同时，逐步实现农业合作化。这对于促进波兰的社会主义建设，无疑将有重大的意义。目前，世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系的和平经济竞赛正进入一个新的阶段。社会主义阵营各国正以一定要压倒资本主义的豪迈气概加速社会主义的建设。苏联的七年计划就是这一阶段的主要的标志。波兰的七年计划和其他社会主义国家发展国民经济的长期计划，都是社会主义同资本主义进行经济竞赛的重要组成部分。
    这次代表大会在制定波兰发展国民经济的计划的同时，强调加强党在人民国家中的领导作用，加强党的团结和加强党的思想工作。波兰党将通过巩固全国统一战线、制止教会的反动政治活动、加强社会主义法制、肃清文化战线上的反社会主义倾向和修正主义倾向等工作，来加强党在人民国家中的领导作用。哥穆尔卡同志指出，目前修正主义是波兰党的最大的危险。修正主义背弃了马克思列宁主义原则，破坏党内团结和社会主义阵营的团结，在这次大会上受到了严厉的谴责。许多代表在发言中表示，必须继续对修正主义进行坚决的斗争。这次大会还强调民主集中制是党内生活的主要原则和党在思想上和政治上的团结一致的条件，强调必须加强党的思想工作，加强党对广大群众的马克思列宁主义思想教育，特别是加强对青年一代的思想教育。所有这些，毫无疑问将对今后波兰的社会主义建设发生深刻的影响。
    这次大会重申了波兰在国际事务中的和平外交政策。大家知道，波兰人民共和国在维护欧洲安全和世界和平的斗争中占有重要地位。波兰提出的建立中欧无原子区的腊帕茨基计划，获得了欧洲国家广泛的支持。目前世界注目的德国问题同波兰人民有着密切的关系。哥穆尔卡同志在报告中重申波兰完全支持苏联关于缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题的建议，以及召开高级会议来解决这些问题的建议；并且强调指出：德意志民主共和国的安全就是波兰的安全，德意志民主共和国的安全是整个社会主义阵营捍卫的。
    这次代表大会强烈谴责阿登纳集团蓄意并吞波兰西部领土阴谋。波兰人民的维护他们祖国西部边疆的主张，毫无疑问将得到一切爱好和平人民的支持。
  帝国主义和一切反动派，任何时候都没有忘记破坏国际共产主义运动的团结和社会主义阵营的团结，特别是社会主义国家同苏联的团结。因此，毫无例外地，他们千方百计地破坏波兰同苏联和其他社会主义国家的团结。然而，事实证明他们是枉费心机的。哥穆尔卡同志在报告中指出，马克思列宁主义的理论是波兰工人运动的唯一基础。1957年11月在莫斯科通过的社会主义国家十二个共产党和工人党共同宣言的原则，作为波兰党的政策的基本指示。波兰统一工人党谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义者妄图破坏国际共产主义运动的团结。哥穆尔卡同志强调指出：“苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动的基本力量。苏联是这一运动的支柱，是所有社会主义国家的支柱。”他并且指出：同苏联的兄弟友谊和牢不可破的联盟是波兰政策的基础，是波兰政策中的基本的、牢固和永久的因素。哥穆尔卡同志的这些话，表达了波兰人民的坚定的意志，再一次证明了国际共产主义的团结和社会主义阵营的团结是牢不可破的。
    有着光荣的革命传统和已经获得了辉煌成就的波兰统一工人党，根据这次代表大会所制定的波兰发展的方针，正领导波兰人民从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。通过这次代表大会的召开，波兰统一工人党加强了自己队伍的团结和党同群众的联系，加强了同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强了同以苏联为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结。这是波兰人民获得新的胜利的重大保证。
    中国和波兰是伟大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的兄弟之邦。我们两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊和坚强的团结。我国人民对于兄弟的波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导下在各方面所获得的伟大成就，感到无限兴奋。我们热烈祝贺波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的胜利，热烈祝贺波兰统一工人党领导波兰人民在建设社会主义和维护世界和平的事业中获得更大的胜利。
