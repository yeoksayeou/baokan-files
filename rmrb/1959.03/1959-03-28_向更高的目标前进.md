The call by Comrade Li Fuchun, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, at the National Iron and Steel Workers' High Production and High Quality Competition Broadcast Rally, to exert even greater effort and strive for ingenuity, greatly encouraged all the workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's Open Hearth Furnace Workshop. On the 18th, Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, issued a new combat mobilization to the city's 100,000 iron and steel troops at the "Responding to the National Steel High Production and High Quality Competition Broadcast Rally," further strengthening our fighting spirit. We are determined to charge forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of high production and high quality steel for the nation's 18 million tons of steel this year. A fervent competition among shifts and groups of the same trade has already unfolded in the workshop, striving to overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state.

The entire workshop's workers are full of confidence. After carefully calculating accounts, tapping potential, finding key points, and devising methods, they have put forward new leap forward targets, an increase of 87.44% compared to last year; utilization coefficient to reach over 1.8 in the second half of the year, an increase of 58.44% compared to last year; furnace output increased from 55 tons to 80 tons; quality reaching over 99.3%. Our slogan is: Learn from Plant No. 3, catch up with Plant No. 3, surpass Plant No. 3, fight hard for half a year to plant the national open hearth high production red flag on our open hearth furnace.

In order to ensure the realization of the above targets, we propose to storm through four major barriers. 1. High Production Barrier: Fully tap the potential of equipment, improve furnace structure, expand charging capacity, increase furnace output from 55 tons to 80 tons, smelting time to be six hours, and implement single-trough double-ladle operation. The pig iron furnace should achieve "one fast and four highs": fast furnace repair, high production, high temperature, high quality, and high furnace age. 2. Raw Materials Barrier: Achieve rational operation, reduce consumption, and save raw materials. 3. Furnace Protection Barrier: Strengthen full-time furnace protection, implement a visa record system, extending the interval between medium repairs from once a month last year to once every two months. 4. Quality Barrier: Not only must we make good steel, but also develop towards high-grade, multi-variety, and produce various high-quality steels.

In order to realize this year's leap forward targets, we must also strive to achieve four major "izations" in a short period of time. 1. Democratization of Steelmaking: Change the past situation of steelmaking by a few people, implement rotating steelmaking, cultivate more talent, and continuously improve technical levels. 2. Mechanization of Charging: Give full play to the strength of machine repair, and also self-manufacture three-wheeled charging machines, scheduled to be put into production in June. 3. Car-ization of Slag Removal: Change slag removal from the front of the furnace to slag removal with slag cars behind the furnace. 4. Scientification of Operation: According to the requirements of high production, high quality, and multi-variety, promptly revise technical operating procedures and rationally use raw materials.

In order to achieve a greater leap forward this year, we are continuing to improve our leadership style, eating, living, and laboring with the workers, leading the masses among the masses, directing production in production, and actively promoting "two participations and three combinations". At the same time, we are launching red flag competitions of the same trade in front of the furnace, pig iron, cast steel, gas, and auxiliary trades, vigorously engaging in rapid steelmaking, and vying for this year's national open hearth high production red flag. We are determined to work hard together with the nation's steel warriors to resolutely complete and overfulfill the glorious task of 18 million tons of steel.

    向更高的目标前进
    中共上钢一厂平炉车间总支书记　周富坤
    李富春同志代表党中央和国务院在全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会上发出的劲上加劲，巧上加巧的号召，大大鼓舞了我们上钢一厂平炉车间的全体职工。十八日，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志在“响应全国钢铁高产优质竞赛广播大会”上，向全市十万钢铁大军发出了新的战斗动员会，更增强了我们的斗志。我们坚决在去年大跃进的基础上，为今年全国产钢一千八百万吨而冲锋陷阵，争取钢铁高产优质全面大丰收。现在车间里已经热烈地展开了班与班、组与组的同工种竞赛，力争超额完成国家给我们的任务。
    全车间职工信心百倍，经过算细账、挖潜力、找关键、想办法，提出了新的跃进指标，比去年增长87.44％；利用系数在下半年争取达到18以上，比去年增长58.44％；炉产量从五十五吨提高到八十吨；质量达到99.3％以上。我们的行动口号是：学三厂、赶三厂、超三厂，苦战半年把全国平炉高产红旗插在我们的平炉上。
    为了保证实现以上指标，我们提出要猛攻四大关。一、高产关：充分挖掘设备潜力，改进炉体结构，扩大装入量，炉产量在五十五吨的基础上提高到八十吨，冶炼时间为六小时，实行单槽双包。化铁炉作到“一快四高”：快速修炉，高产、高温、高质、高炉龄。二、原料关：做到合理操作，降低消耗，节约原材料。三、护炉关：加强专职护炉，实行签证纪录制度，由去年每月中修一次延长到两个月中修一次。四、质量关：不但要炼好钢，而且向高级、多品种方向发展，炼出各种优质钢。
    为了实现今年跃进指标，我们还要争取在短时间内实现四大化。一、炼钢民主化。改变过去由少数人炼钢的情况，实行轮流炼钢，更多地培养人材，不断提高技术水平。二、进料机械化。充分发挥机修力量，同时自制三轮式加料机，预订在6月份投入生产。三、出渣车子化。使炉前出渣改为炉后用渣车出渣。四、操作科学化。根据高产、优质、多品种的要求，及时修改技术操作规程，合理使用原材料。
    为了实现今年更大跃进，我们正在继续改进领导作风，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，到群众中领导群众、在生产中指挥生产，积极推行“两参三结合”。同时，开展炉前、化铁、铸钢、煤气等以及辅助工种的同工种红旗竞赛，大搞快速炼钢，争夺今年全国平炉高产红旗。我们决心和全国钢铁战士一起，大干一场，为坚决完成和超额完成一千八百万吨钢的光荣任务而奋斗。
