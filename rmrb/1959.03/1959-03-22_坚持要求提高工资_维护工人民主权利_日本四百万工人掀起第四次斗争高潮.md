Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 20th: Four million workers across Japan held strikes and rallies today, insisting on wage increases, the implementation of an 8,000 yen minimum wage system, improved living conditions for workers, and the defense of workers' democratic rights.

Today's massive struggle is the fourth nationwide unified action in the spring struggle led by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo). The main force of this unified struggle is workers in the public utilities sector and the steel, coal, shipbuilding, and metal mining sectors.

Coal miners held 24-hour strikes in sixty-six mines. Among them, workers at Mitsui Mining Company, one of Japan's largest coal mining companies, continued the 72-hour strike that began yesterday. The Japan Coal Miners' Union also decided that workers at fourteen large coal mining companies would hold indefinite strikes starting March 23 to achieve their demands.

Metal miners continued their indefinite strikes in eighteen mines. In the steel industry, workers at Fuji Iron & Steel Co. and Nippon Kokan K. K., two of Japan's three major steel companies, held 24-hour strikes. Shipyard workers held key strikes nationwide.

Workers in public utilities sectors such as postal service, telecommunications, national railways, printing, paper making, and the monopoly industry, because Japanese law prohibits them from striking, held workplace rallies across the country today. Among them, workers in the telecommunications sector stopped their struggle midway because the authorities were forced to meet their demands for wage increases.

According to a decision made by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on March 18, Japanese workers will launch the fifth and sixth unified actions on March 25 and mid-April, and will launch a climax of the spring struggle in late March and early April.

The General Council also decided that in future unified actions, Japanese workers must strengthen the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and oppose the Kishida Nobusuke government's minimum wage bill, the "performance rating" system, and the conspiracy to revise the Social Education Law.

    坚持要求提高工资　维护工人民主权利
    日本四百万工人掀起第四次斗争高潮
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本全国四百万工人今天在各地举行罢工和集会，坚持要求提高工资、实行八千日元的最低工资制、改善工人的生活条件和维护工人的民主权利。
    今天的声势浩大的斗争是日本工会总评议会领导展开的春季斗争的第四次全国性统一行动。这次统一斗争的主力是公用事业部门和钢铁、煤矿、造船、金属矿山部门的工人。
    煤矿工人在六十六个矿山举行了二十四小时罢工，其中，日本最大的煤矿公司之一的三井矿山公司的工人在继续举行从昨天开始的七十二小时罢工。日本煤矿工会还决定，十四个大煤矿公司的工人将从3月23日起举行无一定期限的罢工，争取实现他们的要求。
    金属矿工在十八个矿山继续进行无一定期限的罢工。在钢铁工业部门，日本三大钢铁公司之中的富士制铁公司和日本钢管公司的工人举行了二十四小时罢工。造船工人在全国范围举行了重点罢工。
    邮政、电信、国营铁道、印刷、造纸、专卖业等公用事业部门的工人，因为日本法律禁止他们罢工，今天在全国一齐举行了工作场所大会。其中，电信部门的工人们因为迫使当局满足了他们提出的增加工资的要求，在中途停止了斗争。
    根据日本工会总评议会18日的决定，日本工人将在3月25日和4月中旬展开第五次和第六次统一行动，并在3月下旬和4月初掀起春季斗争的高潮。
    总评议会还决定，今后日本工人要在统一行动中加强粉碎日美
  “安全条约”、反对岸信介政府的最低工资制法案、“勤务评定”制度和修改社会教育法的阴谋的斗争。
