    Developing Suburban Poultry Production
    Zhen Hua
    New industrial and mining areas are constantly appearing in our country, and the populations of existing cities are also constantly increasing due to the rapid development of industry. Thus, the demand for poultry and eggs and other non-staple foods from industrial and mining areas and cities is increasing. What can be done to meet this demand? Universally developing rural poultry farming so that rural areas produce more poultry and eggs is an important method. Judging from the situation in many areas, in addition to the above method, there is another method, which is to make full use of the favorable conditions in the suburbs of cities to develop poultry production.
    Cities are generally the concentration points for food processing, and many vegetables are grown in the suburbs of cities. The by-products of these processing industries and the vegetable scraps are good feeds that can be utilized. Poultry and eggs produced in the suburbs can be directly supplied to the cities, greatly reducing the amount of transportation and transportation links. In this way, on the one hand, the cost of these non-staple foods can be reduced, and on the other hand, consumers can eat the freshest poultry and eggs. Some people simply regard the development of suburban poultry production as just raising chickens and ducks as in the past. Although what is advocated in the suburbs today is still raising chickens and ducks, the significance of raising them today is very different from the past. Raising poultry is an important part of the diversified economy of the communes. Developing poultry farming in the suburbs, on the one hand, enriches the production content of the suburban communes and invigorates the economy of the communes; on the other hand, it supplies the people fighting on various production fronts in the cities and supports socialist construction.
    Judging from the experience of some areas, the most basic aspect of developing suburban poultry production is to organize the suburban communes to raise a large number of poultry. Each suburban commune should regard this production as an important part of all production, and make arrangements for labor, sites, and funds item by item. It is hoped that leaders at all levels will attach importance to this work and earnestly solve these problems so that the suburban poultry farming can develop smoothly.
    Urban residents and collective catering units of enterprises, institutions, and schools distributed inside and outside the city, as well as the catering industry, can also appropriately develop poultry production. This can not only utilize the food discarded by the unit, which is in line with the principle of thrift, but also obtain a certain amount of poultry meat and eggs to improve living standards.
    Rapidly developing suburban poultry farming is possible, but not easy. The units engaged in suburban poultry production include communes, enterprises, institutions, schools, and the vast number of residents; raising poultry requires seed eggs, incubators, feed, epidemic prevention drugs, etc.; after the poultry is raised, there are many things to do such as purchase and supply. This is a new and relatively complex task. To accomplish it requires not only the competent authorities to strengthen leadership in this area, but also the close cooperation of all relevant departments.

    发展市郊家禽生产
    振华
    我国新的工矿区正在不断出现，原有的城市由于工业的迅速发展，人口也在不断增加。这样，工矿区和城市对于家禽和禽蛋等副食品的要求是越来越多了。用什么办法来满足这一要求呢？普遍发展农村养禽业，由农村生产更多的家禽、禽蛋是一个重要的办法；从许多地区的情况看，除上面这个办法以外还有一个办法，就是充分利用城市郊区的有利条件发展家禽生产。
    城市一般都是食粮加工的集中点，城市郊区种植蔬菜很多。这些加工工业的副产物和蔬菜的下脚菜都是可以利用的好饲料。市郊生产的家禽和蛋品，可以直接供应城市，大大减少了运输量和运输环节。这样，一方面可以降低这些副食品的成本，另一方面还可以使消费者吃到最新鲜的家禽、禽蛋。有人把发展市郊家禽生产简单地看成只是和过去一样的养些鸡鸭。今天在市郊提倡饲养的虽然还是鸡鸭，但是今天饲养它们意义却和过去大不相同了。养家禽是公社多种经营的一个重要内容，市郊发展养禽业，一方面丰富了市郊各公社的生产内容，更加活跃了公社的经济；另一方面供应了城市各个生产战线上奋战的人们，支援了社会主义建设。
    从一些地区的经验看，发展市郊家禽生产，最基本的方面是组织郊区各公社大量饲养。每个郊区公社应当把这项生产作为全部生产的一个重要组成部分，在劳力、场所、资金等方面都要逐项的加以安排。希望各级领导重视这项工作，切实解决这些问题，使郊区的养禽事业顺利地发展起来。
    城市居民和分布在城市内外的企业、机关、学校的集体伙食单位以及经营饮食的行业等，也可以适当发展养禽生产，这样既能够利用本单位废弃的食物，符合节约的原则，也可以取得一定数量的禽肉和蛋品，改善生活。
    迅速发展市郊养禽业是可能办到的，但不是轻而易举的。进行市郊家禽生产的单位包括有公社、企业、机关、学校以及广大居民；饲养家禽又需要种卵、孵化器、饲料、防疫药物等等；家禽育成以后还有收购、供应等许多要作的事情。这是一项新的、内容又比较繁多的工作，完成它不仅要主管部门加强这一方面的领导，而且需要各有关部门的密切协作。
