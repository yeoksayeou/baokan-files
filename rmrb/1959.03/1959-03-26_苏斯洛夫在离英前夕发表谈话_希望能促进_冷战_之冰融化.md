Xinhua News Agency report: A delegation from the Soviet Supreme Soviet, led by Suslov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet Supreme Soviet Union Council, returned to Moscow by "Tu-104" aircraft on the afternoon of the 24th, after concluding their visit to England.

The delegation of the Soviet Supreme Soviet visited England on March 13th at the invitation of the Anglo-Soviet Parliamentary Committee.

Before returning home, Suslov delivered a speech in London, saying that the delegation of the Soviet Supreme Soviet visited London, Manchester, South Wales, Reading, Crawley and other places in England, and held talks and meetings with members of the Anglo-Soviet Parliamentary Committee, members of the Foreign Policy and Industry and Commerce Committee, Labour Party members of parliament, people from industry and commerce, representatives of trade unions and cooperative organizations, and editors-in-chief of many major newspapers. The delegation also met and talked with Labour Party leader Gaitskell, famous Labour Party activist Bevan, and members of the Labour Party Executive Committee. During these conversations, they exchanged views on many international issues. In addition, the delegation also visited British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and Stodart-Scott, Chairman of the British Parliamentary Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

Suslov said: In our talks with representatives of the British public, we did our best to explain the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and our line: to strive for mutual understanding and trust in order to ease international tensions and strengthen peace. We described the scene of the Soviet people of all ethnic groups joyfully working to realize the great Seven-Year Plan, which is full of the spirit of peace.

During our visit to England, we had the opportunity to see that among a wide range of people in your country, the desire for peace and cooperation with the Soviet Union is constantly growing. We must further seek and discover a common language for resolving international issues through negotiation.

Suslov finally expressed the hope that the visit of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation to England would promote the melting of the "Cold War" ice, and hoped that the clouds of war would disappear from the international horizon forever.

On the 23rd, the Anglo-Soviet Parliamentary Committee hosted a banquet in the Houses of Parliament to entertain the visiting delegation of the Soviet Supreme Soviet to England. In his speech, Suslov pointed out that after ten days of talks, the two sides have achieved a certain degree of mutual understanding and convergence of views on the assessment of a series of issues. These issues include: recognizing the importance of the principle of peaceful coexistence, abandoning the "position of strength" policy, recognizing the principle of equality when resolving international issues, holding summit meetings to consolidate peace, recognizing the danger of reviving German militarism and equipping it with atomic weapons, and making every effort to improve Anglo-Soviet relations. Both sides also agreed that it is necessary to immediately stop nuclear weapons tests in order to help ease the international situation and pave the way for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

Suslov pointed out that, however, differences of opinion still exist between the two sides, which is not surprising. These differences are particularly evident in the specific ways to solve certain important international issues.

He said that the result of the exchange of views has undoubtedly made your attitude clearer to us, and we have a clearer concept of your attitude.

Suslov emphasized that the current task is to work with the people of other peace-loving countries to do everything possible to strengthen peace, stop the "Cold War", and throw the "position of strength" policy in international relations into the garbage heap of history. All international disputes should be resolved peacefully, through negotiations, in the interest of peace and the security of all peoples.

    苏斯洛夫在离英前夕发表谈话
    希望能促进“冷战”之冰融化
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：由苏联最高苏维埃联盟院外交委员会主席苏斯洛夫率领的一批苏联最高苏维埃代表24日下午结束在英国的访问后，乘“图—一○四”飞机回到莫斯科。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表是应英苏议会委员会的邀请于本月13日到英国访问的。
    苏斯洛夫回国前在伦敦发表谈话说，苏联最高苏维埃代表团在英国访问了伦敦、曼彻斯特、南威尔士、里丁、克劳莱等地方，同英苏议会委员会的委员们、外交政策和工商委员会的委员们、工党议员、实业界人士、工会和合作组织的代表以及许多大报的主编，进行了会谈和会晤。代表团还同工党领袖盖茨克尔、工党著名活动家比万以及工党执行委员会的委员们会面和交谈。在这些交谈中，彼此就许多国际问题交换了意见。此外，代表团还访问了英国外交大臣劳埃德和各国议会联盟英国议员团主席斯多达特—斯科特。
    苏斯洛夫说：在我们同英国公众代表的谈话中，我们尽力解释了苏联的和平外交政策和我们的路线：为了缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平，要争取达到相互谅解和信任。我们讲述了苏联各族人民为了实现充满和平精神的伟大的七年计划而欢欣鼓舞地劳动的情景。
    在我们访问英国期间，我们有机会看到，在你们国家广大人士中正在不断地滋长着要求和平和同苏联合作的愿望。我们必须进一步寻找和发现通过谈判解决国际问题的共同语言。
    苏斯洛夫最后表示希望苏联最高苏维埃代表团对英国的访问将促使“冷战”之冰融化，希望战争的乌云从国际地平线上永远消失。
    英苏议会委员会23日在议会大厦设宴招待苏联最高苏维埃访英代表。苏斯洛夫在讲话中指出，经过十天来的会谈，双方在对一系列问题的估计上已经取得了一定的互相谅解和观点的接近。这些问题包括：承认和平共处原则的重要性、放弃“实力地位”政策、在解决国际问题时承认平等原则、举行政府首脑会议来巩固和平、承认复活德国军国主义并以原子武器来装备它的危险性以及全力改进英苏关系等。双方还一致认为，有必要立即停止核武器试验，以便有助于缓和国际局势和替禁止核武器开辟道路。
    苏斯洛夫指出，但是双方在观点上也仍然存在着分歧，这是不足为奇的。这种分歧特别表现在通过怎样的具体途径来解决某些重要国际问题这一点上。
    他说，交换意见的结果，无疑已经使你们更清楚地理解了我们的态度，而我们对你们态度也有了更明确的概念。
    苏斯洛夫强调说，目前的任务是，同其他爱好和平的国家的人民一起，尽一切努力来加强和平、停止“冷战”，把国际关系中的“实力地位”政策扔到历史的垃圾堆里去。用和平方式、通过谈判来解决一切国际争端，以利和平和各国人民的安全。
