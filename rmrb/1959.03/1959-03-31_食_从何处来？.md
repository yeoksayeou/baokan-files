    Where Does "Food" Come From?
    Xiang Yuan
    A seed can grow into a towering tree; a fish egg can become a shark weighing ten thousand pounds. Their volume increases by tens of millions of times. How much organic matter is needed to form them? All living things must consume energy as long as they are alive. An adult, even if he doesn't do any work, consumes 2,400 large calories of energy per day. Where does this organic matter come from? Where does the energy come from?

　　It turns out that all living things must eat food. Food is a substance that can form the body and supply energy; for example, sugars (including starch, cellulose), proteins, fats, vitamins, etc. They can not only form the body but also be oxidized during respiration to release energy. In addition, water and mineral salts, although also necessary for living organisms and able to participate in the composition of the body, cannot be called food because they cannot supply energy.
    All living organisms cannot live without food. How to obtain food? There are two different paths and methods:

    One is the path of self-reliance, such as green plants, which make organic food from inorganic matter themselves to meet the needs of growth. This is what is called "autotrophy."

    These green plants have a huge and amazing root system that is distributed in the soil. Someone calculated that the roots of a rye plant, including all the branches, forks, and root hairs, are more than 11,000 kilometers long, equal to the length of two Yangtze Rivers. This is a raw material procurement system that goes deep into the grassroots level. Each root hair is the most basic raw material procurement station, vigorously purchasing raw materials such as water and inorganic salts from the soil, and sending them to the leaves through the transportation trunk line – the stem. The leaves are a food factory, with many small chimneys on them, called stomata. These stomata not only discharge oxygen and evaporate water, but also absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide. Sometimes, a small chimney can absorb 25 trillion carbon dioxide molecules in one second.

    The water sent by the purchasing station and the carbon dioxide absorbed by the small chimneys are the two most basic raw materials for synthesizing organic matter. Some people must be wondering, is this going to make soda? Indeed, soda factories use pressure to press carbon dioxide into water, plus some fruit juice and spices, to make refreshing soda. However, plants cannot live by drinking soda. What they need is food containing high energy.

    Soda undergoes wonderful changes in the synthesis workshop – chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are small particles composed of chlorophyll and protein, and a mesophyll cell generally contains twenty to one hundred. The green color of the leaves is their color. Chloroplasts absorb the light energy of the sun and synthesize soda into organic matter containing high energy, while releasing waste gas – oxygen, which is discharged from the chimneys. It is generally believed that the first thing synthesized is a simple sugar, which is then processed into more complex compounds such as starch, protein, and fat. This is the famous photosynthesis. It looks very simple, but it is a very complex process. To this day, people have not figured out why they can turn a bottle of soda into a bag of sugar.

    Most of the food synthesized by plants is used to form the body and stored in seeds or tubers. A small part is decomposed into water and carbon dioxide through respiration, but at the same time, energy is released to supply life activities.

    The other path is called heterotrophy. They have no ability to make food themselves, but they all have mouths that want to eat food. All animals and some microorganisms are in this category. They reap the benefits without labor, relying on plants to live.

    Cunning hares live on weeds and stealing fruits from farmers, while insidious wolves use hares as food. Once a wolf encounters a tiger, it becomes a sacrifice. After the tiger dies, it becomes a paradise for bacteria. Before long, the corpse is decomposed into carbon dioxide and water, returning to nature, and becoming a raw material for plants to make food.

    Therefore, rabbits, wolves, tigers, and bacteria ultimately rely on plants to live.

    In addition to eating 120,000 catties of water in their lifetime, people also eat 20,000 catties of carbohydrates, 3,200 catties of protein, and 2,000 catties of fat. Our skin does not grow chlorophyll, so of course we belong to the heterotrophic type. Whether we eat meat or are vegetarian, we rely on plants to live. People are particularly particular about food, talking about nutrition and taste. Long ago, people understood agriculture and set up green factories to let crops turn soda into food. People take the most nutritious parts, such as seeds, fruits, tubers, etc., as food. Although the remaining stems and stalks are also organic matter, people do not like to eat them, so they set up another processing factory to raise pigs and chickens. These unpalatable foods are digested and absorbed by pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks, and become high-level foods such as pork, milk, and eggs.

    Therefore, except for a very few bacteria that can synthesize food by chemical energy without relying on sunlight, all other living things rely on the photosynthesis of green plants to obtain food. Global plants can produce 400 billion tons of organic matter in a year. This is truly the largest synthesis factory.

### “食”从何处来？

    “食”从何处来？
    相远
    一粒种子，能长成漫天的大树；一颗鱼卵，能变成万斤的鲨鱼；它们的体积增大了千万倍，需要多少的有机物质来组成。一切生物，只要活着就要消耗能量。一个成年人，即使一点工作也不做，一天也要消耗二千四百大卡的能量。这些有机物质从何来？能量从何来？　
　原来，一切生物都要吃食物，食物就是一种能够构成躯体和供应能量的物质；例如糖类（包括淀粉、纤维素）蛋白质、脂肪维生素、等等，它们既能构成躯体，又能在呼吸时被氧化而放出能量。另外如水、矿物质盐类，虽然也是生物体所必需的，而且能参与躯体的组成，但不能称为食物，因为它们不能供应能量。
    一切活的生物都离不开食物。如何获得食物？这有着两种不同的道路和方法：
    一条是自力更生的道路，例如绿色植物，它们自己动手来把无机物制造成有机的食物，满足生长的需要，这就是所谓“自养”。
    这些绿色植物有着一个庞大得惊人的根系，分布在土壤里。有人计算过，一棵黑麦的根，枝枝叉叉连根毛全算在内，一共有一万一千多公里长，等于两条长江的长度。这就是一个深入基层的原料采购系统。每一个根毛就是一个最基层的原料采购站，大力的收买土壤中的水分和无机盐等原料，经过运输干线——茎，源源送入叶子里。叶子就是一个食品工厂，上面有着许多小烟囱，叫气孔。这些气孔一面排出氧气和蒸发水分，一面还吸入大量的碳酸气，有时，一个小烟囱，在一秒钟内能吸进二万五千亿个碳酸气分子。
    采购站送上来的水，和小烟囱吸进来的碳酸气，就是合成有机物的两个最基本的原料。一定有人怀疑，这莫不是要制造汽水了？的确汽水厂就是利用压力把碳酸气压在水里，再加上些果汁香料之类，就成了清凉可口的汽水。然而植物却不能靠喝汽水来过日子，它们需要的是含有高能的食物。
    汽水就在合成车间——叶绿体里，发生了奇妙的变化。叶绿体是由叶绿素和蛋白质等组成的小颗粒，一个叶肉细胞里，一般含二十至一百个。叶子的绿色，就是它们的颜色。叶绿体吸收了太阳的光能，就把汽水合成为含有高能的有机物质，同时放出废气——氧，由烟囱排出。一般认为最初合成的是一种简单的糖，然后再加工成淀粉、蛋白质脂肪等更复杂的化合物。这就是赫赫有名的光合作用。看上去顶简单，但却是一个非常复杂的过程，至今人们还未弄明白它们为什么能把一瓶汽水变成了一包糖。
    植物合成了这些食物，大部分都用来组成躯体和贮藏在种子或块根块茎中，小部分经呼吸作用又被分解成水和碳酸气，但同时放出能量，供给生命活动之用。
    另一条道路叫异养。自己没本领制造食物，但却都长着一张要吃食物的嘴巴，例如所有的动物和部分微生物都是这一类。它们坐享其成，靠植物来生活。
    狡猾的野兔靠野草和盗窃农民的果实来生活，阴险的狼却要以野兔来做食物，狼一旦碰到了老虎，也就成了牺牲品，老虎死后又成了细菌的乐园，不用多久，尸体就被分解得精光，变成了碳酸气和水，回到大自然中，又成了植物制造食物的原料。
    所以兔、狼、虎、和细菌，归根结底都是靠植物来生活。
    人，一生中除了要吃进十二万斤水外，还要吃进二万斤糖类，三千二百斤蛋白质，和二千斤脂肪，我们皮肤上不会长出叶绿素，当然是属于异养型，吃荤也好，吃素也罢，反正都是靠植物而生活。人的食物就格外讲究，要谈营养，讲味道，很久以前人们就懂得了农业，办起了绿色工厂让庄稼来把汽水变成食物。人们把其中营养最丰富的部分如种子、果实、块根块茎等拿来做粮食，剩下的茎秆、糠麸虽然也是有机物质，但人不爱吃，就再办一个加工厂，养猪、养鸡，这些不好吃的食物经过猪、牛、鸡、鸭的消化吸收，就变成了猪肉、牛奶、鸡蛋等高级食物。
    所以，世界上除了极个别的细菌，能不依赖阳光而靠化学能来合成食物外，其它一切生物都靠绿色植物的光合作用来获得食物。全球的植物，一年中能制造出四千亿吨有机物，这真是一个最大的合成工厂了。
