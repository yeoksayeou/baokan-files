Several Issues to Note in Arranging Production
Wang Wenyu, First Secretary of the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee

In the mass movement to rectify people's communes, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has set off a new leap forward upsurge. The entire prefecture has done a better job than last year in tasks such as accumulating fertilizer, processing minor spring crops, and deep plowing the land. Some counties have more than doubled their winter fertilizer accumulation compared to 1958. As a result of the large-scale water conservancy efforts across the prefecture, water storage has increased nearly twofold compared to the same period last year. The people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, after communization, are striving with soaring enthusiasm to realize the call of the Party Central Committee and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

In the face of this new leap forward upsurge, there are many aspects of the people's communes that deserve attention, among which the arrangement of production is the most central issue. Recently, all counties in the autonomous prefecture convened four-level cadre meetings, mobilizing everyone to earnestly summarize the experiences of 1958. The deeper and more thorough these experiences are summarized, the greater the confidence and enthusiasm of the people. In summarizing experiences, we encountered a common problem, which is how people's communes should fully utilize their advantages to arrange this year's production. After the four-level cadre meetings, we worked in the Qianjin People's Commune in Chuxiong County for a few days to help them make arrangements.

Last year, the Qianjin People's Commune's grain output was more than 42 million jin, averaging 1,400 jin per person. This year, they have made two production arrangements. The result of the first arrangement was that the entire commune could only increase production by 30%. After studying the Central Committee's "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes," they mobilized commune members to earnestly summarize last year's experiences and lessons, and made a second production arrangement, raising the grain production increase target from the original 30% to 100%. Moreover, the entire commune can save more than 20% of its labor force, thus making the labor force appear more abundant, and the commune members feel more confident in achieving the increase in production. Through the comparison of these two production arrangements, it can be seen that fully utilizing the advantages of communization and fully utilizing the experiences and lessons of last year is an important link in arranging this year's production well.

The Qianjin People's Commune solved the following three problems when arranging production:

First, after communization, there are conditions to enable the means of production, especially land, to be used more rationally and effectively. Under unified leadership, the Qianjin Commune classified all the fields in the commune, ensuring that basic farmland with good water conservancy conditions achieved large-area high yields; at the same time, it arranged other land more rationally, so that various lands adapted to their different characteristics and played a greater role. Commune members reflected that this arrangement was "focusing efforts on the key points." They designated 15,000 mu of good land as basic farmland, fixed the labor force, with one person managing five mu, applying fine fertilizer, using improved varieties, deep plowing and careful weeding, and rational close planting, planning to produce 2,000 jin of grain per mu. They strived for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu on 20,000 mu of general farmland. They planted corn on 10,000 mu of mountain fields and hillsides. The water in these mountain fields is limited, and there is no guarantee for planting rice, but it is very good for planting corn, and it is very certain to produce 2,000 jin per mu. As a result of this arrangement, water was fully utilized, crops were arranged rationally, the labor force was deployed rationally, and some excessively concentrated farm work was appropriately staggered in time. Not only is the increase in production more certain, but also more than 2,000 laborers can be saved.

Second, while ensuring the completion of the grain production increase task, the Qianjin Commune also paid attention to comprehensively arranging diversified operations, so that self-sufficient production and commodity production were carried out simultaneously. After communization, the combination of the wage system and the supply system requires the commune to carry out diversified operations and to combine self-sufficient production and commodity production. Moreover, the establishment of the commune also provides sufficient conditions for diversified operations. For example, in pig raising, when arranging production, more than 1,000 mu of land suitable for planting feed crops were set aside to grow feed crops. The entire commune will raise 80,000 pigs this year, including 15,000 fat pigs, which can guarantee the completion of the state-allocated tasks and the meat needs of the commune members. The income from pig raising is almost enough to cover the annual wage expenses of all commune members. In addition, pig manure is used to fertilize the fields, saving labor and improving quality, with one load being equivalent to ten loads. Next year, the entire commune can achieve two pigs per mu of farmland, with pig manure being used for all the fertilizer on the basic farmland, saving more than 300,000 labor days of fertilizer accumulation. It can be seen that diversified operations not only meet the needs of the country but also the needs of the commune itself.

Third, to complete the more arduous task of increasing production than last year, it is necessary to rationally solve the problem of labor. Through summarizing last year's experience, the Qianjin Commune deeply realized that efforts should be focused on the most important areas. In addition to classifying farmland, they also considered the issue of labor in water conservancy, fertilizer, and other measures. For example, in water conservancy, the commune originally planned to build two dams in the mountainous area, which would require a lot of labor and provide little benefit. After the farmland was rearranged, water conservancy was also based on the new situation, focusing efforts on building a large ditch, which not only saved about half of the labor force but also irrigated more than 2,000 mu of good farmland.

In order to better improve labor efficiency, they also prominently focused on labor organization and improved tools, so that one person can do the work of ten, and ten people can do the work of a hundred, without wasting a single laborer. They adopted a combination of specialized teams and shock brigades, and took a series of measures such as establishing a responsibility system for various farm tasks. Labor organization has been improved and labor efficiency has been increased. The labor efficiency of the entire commune has generally increased by more than 30%.

After the Qianjin People's Commune fully mobilized the masses to solve the above problems, a new production plan was formulated. The commune members were all delighted and full of confidence in this new plan. Some said, "Now there is a place to put our efforts!" Others said, "As long as we can use all the advantages of the commune, we can guarantee a bumper harvest this year."

    安排生产中应注意的几个问题
    中共楚雄地委第一书记  王文玉
    云南省楚雄彝族自治州在整顿人民公社的群众运动中，掀起了一个新的跃进高潮。全州积肥造肥、小春作物的加工和深翻土地等工作都比去年做得好。有的县冬季积肥比1958年增加了一倍以上。全州大兴水利的结果，蓄水量比去年同时期增加了将近一倍。公社化后的全州各族人民正以冲天的劲头来实现党中央的号召，争取今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    在这个新的跃进高潮面前，人民公社值得注意的方面很多，其中安排生产则是最中心的问题。最近，自治州各县都召开了四级干部会议，发动大家认真总结1958年的经验。这些经验总结得越深越透，大家的信心就越大，劲头就越足。在总结经验当中，我们遇到了一个带有普遍性的问题，这就是人民公社应当怎样充分运用自己的优越性，来安排今年的生产。四级干部会议以后，我们在楚雄县的前进人民公社里工作了几天，帮助他们进行了安排。
    前进人民公社去年的粮食产量是四千二百多万斤，平均每人合一千四百斤。今年，他们先后做过两次生产安排。第一次安排的结果，全社只能增产三成。学习了中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”以后，他们又发动社员认真总结了去年的经验教训，进行了第二次的生产安排，粮食增产指标从原来的三成提高到一倍。而且，全社还可以节省20％以上的劳动力，因而劳动力显得更宽裕了，社员们都感到增产更可靠了。通过这两次生产安排的对比，可以看出：充分运用公社化的优越性，充分运用去年的经验教训，是安排好今年生产的一个重要环节。
    前进人民公社在安排生产时，解决了下述三个问题：
    第一、公社化以后，首先是有条件使生产资料、特别是土地能够得到更合理更有效的使用。前进公社在统一领导下，把全社的田地作了排队分类，保证水利条件好的基本农田获得大面积丰产；同时更合理地安排了其他的土地，从而使各种土地适应于各种土地的不同特点，发挥这些土地的更大作用。社员们反映这样安排是“把劲头使在关节上”。他们把一万五千亩好田划定为基本农田，固定劳动力，一人管五亩，施细肥，用良种，深耕细薅，合理密植，每亩计划产粮两千斤。两万亩一般农田，争取亩产一千斤。把一万亩山田山地种玉米。这些山田里的水是有限量的，用来种稻谷没有保证，可是用来种玉米就很好，每亩产两千斤是很有把握的。这样安排的结果，充分地运用了水，合理地安排了作物，合理地部署了劳动力，而且在时间上把某些过分集中的农活也适当地错开了，不但增产更有把握，而且可以节省出两千多个劳动力。
    第二、在保证完成粮食增产任务的前提下，前进公社还注意全面安排多种经营，使自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。公社化以后，工资制和供给制相结合，这就要求公社必须进行多种经营，必须使自给性生产和商品性生产结合进行。而且公社的成立，也为多种经营提供了充分的条件。例如养猪，在安排生产时，抽出了一千多亩适宜于种植饲料作物的田地种饲料作物，全社今年养猪八万头，其中有肥猪一万五千头，可以保证完成国家分配的任务和社员肉食的需要。养猪的收入，几乎够全社社员一年的工资开支。此外，猪粪压田，工省质高，一挑抵十挑。明年全社就可以做到一亩田上两头猪的猪肥，基本农田的肥料全部用猪粪，可以节省三十多万个积肥的劳动日。由此可见，多种经营是既符合国家的需要，也符合公社本身的需要的。
    第三、要完成比去年更为艰巨的增产任务，就要合理解决劳动力的问题。前进公社通过总结去年经验，深切地体会到要把干劲使在最要紧的地方。他们除了把农田排队分类以外，还在水利、肥料以及其他各项措施上都考虑了劳动力的问题。例如修水利，原来公社计划在山区修两个水坝，费工大而受益少，田地重新安排以后，水利也从新的情况出发，集中力量修一条大沟，不但节省了一半左右的劳动力，而且可以多灌溉二千多亩良田。
    为了更好地提高劳动效率，他们还突出地抓住劳动组织和改良工具，做到一当十，十当百，不浪费一个劳动力。他们采取了专业队与突击队相结合的办法，并采取了建立各种农活的责任制等一系列的措施。劳动组织改善了，劳动效率提高了。全社的劳动效率一般提高了30％以上。
    前进人民公社充分发动群众解决了以上几个问题以后，新的生产规划制订出来了，社员们对这个新的规划都欢欣鼓舞，满怀信心，有的说：“这下子劲可有地方使了！”有的说：“只要我们能够把公社的优越性都运用起来，就能保证今年大丰产”。
