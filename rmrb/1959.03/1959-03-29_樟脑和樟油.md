    Camphor and camphor oil are special products of our country, mainly produced in the regions south of the Yangtze River.

    Camphor is a white crystalline substance obtained from the trunk, branches, leaves, and roots of the camphor tree through distillation and refining. Camphor oil is the oil remaining after camphor extraction. The camphor tree is an evergreen arbor, with many varieties and variations, the common ones being oil camphor, hon-sho camphor, ho camphor, and yellow camphor. Ho camphor and yellow camphor can be used to extract natural yellow camphor oil, which is a raw material for manufacturing heliotropin, vanillin, and isoeugenol. Hon-sho camphor and oil camphor can be used to extract camphor and camphor oil. Camphor has mothproof and moisture-proof properties and is an important industrial raw material, mainly used in national defense, medicine, and celluloid industries. It can also be used to extract various aromatic oils. Camphor oil has bactericidal properties and is the main raw material for manufacturing the pesticide DDT. After refining, it can also be used to extract eucalyptol, gasoline, and as a raw material for soap and fragrances. These materials are important export commodities. (Picture attached)
