    On the Importance of Tactics
    —Reflections on Reading
    Lu Gong

    Academic and ideological criticism is a kind of debate, and we must pay attention to tactics.

    To conduct a battle, of course, the first thing is to have the right direction. If the direction is right, and we can also pay attention to tactics, we can achieve even greater victories.

    Lu Xun was very particular about the tactics of polemics, and he also had some writings on tactics. In a letter to Xu Guangping, Lu Xun once discussed the characteristics of articles about "women," saying: "The special characteristics are even easier to see in argumentative articles. That is, listing the opponent's words one by one, refuting them from beginning to end, although sharp, is not weighty, and rarely directly hits the 'enemy's' vital point, only inflicting a fatal heavy blow" (see "Letters Between Two Places," Complete Works, Vol. 9, p. 34).

    It seems that what Lu Xun describes here is not so much the characteristic of "women's" argumentative writing, but rather the common problem that young people who are "new to the battlefield" are prone to making in their argumentative writing. For those young people who are brave in battle but lack combat experience, pointing out their weaknesses and teaching them tactics is a practical help. In this letter, Lu Xun is teaching his "female" students not only to be brave in battle but also to be good at it, to learn to "directly hit the 'enemy's' vital point, only inflicting a fatal heavy blow."

    In another article, Lu Xun also taught young people: "Combative authors should focus on 'debate,'" be good at "seizing opportunities to take advantage of weaknesses, defeating the enemy with one blow. If you just make a lot of noise, it's the 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' style of warfare..." (See Complete Works, Vol. 4, pp. 345, 346.)

    "Just making a lot of noise" of course does not help the debate, and "listing the opponent's words one by one, refuting them from beginning to end" cannot hit the enemy's vital point. Because, first of all, conducting a debate often cannot rely solely on the method of "discussing the article as it is written," but must place the enemy's articles and viewpoints in the background of a certain ideological struggle, examine them, and then reveal the essence of these viewpoints. Secondly, even regarding the article itself, the mistake of a wrong theory lies in the fundamental point being wrong; not every sentence is necessarily wrong. To be able to confuse people, a wrong theory is often mixed with many arguments that are not wrong or are not very relevant, and they are not necessarily so "purely" or nakedly wrong. Moreover, wrong theories mostly use some correct propositions to distort them, use some one-sided principles to absolutize them, use some real examples to interpret them wrongly, or make absurd extensions, or make inappropriate analogies, or make substitutions of concepts... In short, they use sophistry as argumentation. Therefore, the critic must first do some research and analysis, understand all of this, and then be able to grasp the fundamental point of its intention, expose the hypocrisy of its techniques, and hit its vital point with one blow. If without careful research and analysis, without seeing through the enemy's techniques, and simply adopting the tactic of "listing the opponent's words one by one, refuting them from beginning to end," one will inevitably fall into entanglement, mixing the fundamental points with the irrelevant, the true intentions with the false ornaments, becoming entangled and unclear. Sometimes, because one is not fundamentally opposed to the enemy, but opposes them sentence by sentence, one may even go to extremes, becoming one-sided, reaching the point of directly negating those correct propositions that have been distorted by the enemy, those one-sided principles that have been absolutized, and those real examples that have been wrongly interpreted. As a result, some of one's own arguments are insufficiently reasoned or wrong, which is very unfavorable for defeating the enemy. This is precisely falling for the enemy's trick.

    Lu Xun's opinions are also beneficial to us today. Of course, the ideological struggles that Lu Xun engaged in at that time mostly belonged to the scope of struggles between ourselves and the enemy, while the ideological criticisms we are conducting today, except for the criticism of reactionary political thoughts such as those of right-wing elements, which belongs to the scope of struggles between ourselves and the enemy, belong to the scope of ideological struggles within the people. The nature is different, and the attitudes and methods adopted must also be different. However, conducting academic and ideological criticism within the people also requires paying attention to tactics and hitting the enemy's vital points. This is the same. Over the past year, young people have made great achievements in the struggle of academic and ideological criticism. First of all, their direction is correct, their thinking is liberated, and they are full of revolutionary spirit to dare to fight against bourgeois academic ideology. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the strength of the collective, and with the help of teachers, they have cultivated their revolutionary ability to fight against bourgeois academic ideology through the practice of struggle. However, young people, being "new to the battlefield," inevitably have some weaknesses due to lack of combat experience, such as refuting sentence by sentence without hitting the vital point. This is a phenomenon that conforms to the law and is not surprising. Young people must constantly summarize experience and constantly study Marxist-Leninist theory and historical and cultural knowledge in the practice of polemics to improve their level. And paying attention to tactics and learning combat experience from predecessors on the ideological front like Lu Xun is also a way to improve one's level.

    要讲究战法
    ——读书随感
    卢弓
    学术思想批判，是一种论战，要讲究战法。
    进行战斗，当然首先还在于方向对头。方向对头了，如能讲究战法，就可以取得更大的胜利。
    鲁迅是很讲究论战的战法的，并且还有一些讲述战法的文字。在给许广平的一封信中，鲁迅曾经论到“女性”的文章的特点，其中说：“一到辩论之文，尤易看出特别。即历举对手之语，从头至尾，逐一驳去，虽然犀利，而不沉重，且罕有正对‘论敌’之要害，仅以一击给与致命的重伤者”（见“两地书”，全集卷9，第34页。）
    看来，鲁迅在这里所描述的，与其说是“女性”的辩论文字的特色，不如说是“初初上阵”的青年的辩论文字较易犯的通病。对于那些勇于战斗，但还缺乏战斗经验的“初初上阵”的青年，指出他们的弱点，教给他们以战法，正是一种切实的帮助。在这封信里，鲁迅正是在教导自己的“女性”的学生，不仅要勇于战斗，而且要善于战斗，要学会“正对‘论敌’的要害，仅以一击给与致命的重伤”。
    在另一篇文章里，鲁迅又曾教给青年说：“战斗的作者应该注重于‘论争’”，要善于“伺隙乘虚，以一击制敌人的死命，如果一味鼓噪，已是‘三国志演义’式战法……”（见全集卷四，第345、346页。）
    “一味鼓噪”当然无补于论争，而“历举对手之语，从头至尾，逐一驳去”，也不能击中论敌的要害。因为，首先，进行论战常常不能单靠“就文论文”的方法，而必须把论敌的文章和观点，置于一定的思想斗争的背景中，加以考察，才能揭露这些观点的本质。其次，即就文章本身而论，一种错误的理论，它的错，在于根本之处错了，不必句句皆错。错误的理论，为了要能迷惑人，往往是掺杂在许多并非错误或不甚相干的议论之中，未必都是错得那么“纯粹”，那么赤裸裸。而且，错误的理论多半要利用一些正确的命题加以歪曲，利用一些片面的道理把它绝对化，利用一些真实的事例把它错误地解释，或作荒谬的引伸，或作不伦的类比，或作概念的偷换……总之，以诡辩充当论证。以所，批判者必须先作一番研究剖析的功夫，洞察这一切，然后才能抓住其立意的根本，揭穿其手法的虚伪，一击而中其要害。如果没有经过仔细地研究剖析，没有看透论敌的手法，简单地采用
  “历举对手之语，从头至尾，逐一驳去”的战法，势必陷于夹缠，把根本之处同无关宏旨之处，把真实的本意同虚假的装璜混在一起，纠缠不清，甚至有时由于不是从根本之处同论敌相对立，而是逐句同论敌相对立，竟至使自己走到极端，失之片面，达到直接否定那些被论敌所歪曲的正确命题，所绝对化的片面道理，所错误解释的真实事例的地步，结果使自己有些论点理由不足，或者错误，对于战胜论敌，十分不利。这正是上了论敌的当的原故。
    鲁迅的这些意见，今天对于我们也是有益的。当然，鲁迅当时所进行的思想斗争，大都属于敌我斗争的范围，而我们今天所进行的思想批判，除了对右派分子之类的反动政治思想的批判，属于敌我斗争的范围以外，则属于人民内部思想斗争的范围，性质不同，所采取的态度与方法也要不同。但是，人民内部进行学术思想批判，也要讲究战法，也要击中论敌的要害，这一点都是相同的。一年多来，青年们在学术思想批判的斗争中，已经取得了很大的成绩。他们首先是方向对头，思想解放，充沛着敢于同资产阶级学术思想作斗争的革命气派。同时，他们在党的领导下，依靠集体的力量，取得教师的帮助，通过斗争的实践，锻炼了同资产阶级学术思想作斗争的革命本领。但是，青年们既属“初初上阵”，就难于完全避免一些由于缺乏战斗经验而产生的弱点，如同逐句驳斥而未能击中要害之类。这原是合乎规律的现象，无足惊怪的。青年们要在论战的实践中不断去总结经验，不断去学习马克思列宁主义理论和历史文化知识，提高自己的水平。而讲究战法，注意向鲁迅这样的思想战线上的前辈们学习战斗经验，也是提高自己的水平的一个途径。
