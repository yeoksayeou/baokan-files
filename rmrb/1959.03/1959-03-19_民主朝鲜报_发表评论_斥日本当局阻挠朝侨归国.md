Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 18th. "Democratic Korea" published an editorial today opposing the "screening" of Korean residents in Japan who wish to return home.

The editorial stated: Now, the issue is very simple. The Korean residents in Japan who want to return home and those who want to welcome them have made all the necessary preparations. All that is needed is for the sending party to fulfill its promise and send them back. There are no complicated issues involved. The editorial stated that the Japanese authorities' proposal to "confirm" or "screen" the will of Korean residents in Japan who request repatriation can only indicate that their words and actions are inconsistent.

The editorial stated that the Japanese authorities absurdly insist that the solution to the issue of the return of Korean residents in Japan "depends on the attitude of North Korea." This statement by the Japanese authorities is an attempt to shift the responsibility for not fulfilling its decisions by reversing black and white. This attitude is tantamount to a thief crying "stop thief."

    “民主朝鲜报”发表评论
    斥日本当局阻挠朝侨归国
    新华社平壤18日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表社论，反对对希望回国的旅日朝侨进行“甄别”。
    社论说：现在，问题已经很简单，要归国的旅日朝侨和要迎接他们的人都已经做好了一切准备，只要遣送的人履行自己的诺言，把他们送回就是了，其中没有任何复杂的问题。社论说，日本当局提出的所谓对要求回国的旅日朝侨的意志加以“确认”或“甄别”的主张，只能表明它言行不一致。
    社论说，日本当局荒唐地硬说旅日朝鲜侨民归国问题的解决“取决于北朝鲜方面的态度如何”。日本当局的这种说法，是想颠倒黑白地把不履行它的决定的责任转嫁于人，这种态度就等于贼喊捉贼。
