    Opinions on the Translation of "Bourgeois Right"
    Zhang Zhongshi, Deputy Director of the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Regarding the translation of the term "bourgeois right," we have recently conducted further research and believe that translating it as "bourgeois-style rights" is more consistent with the original meaning.
    The commonly used term "bourgeois right" is based on the following sentence in the Chinese translation of Marx's book "Critique of the Gotha Program": "Here, equal right is still in principle bourgeois right" (see "Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Volume 2, page 22). In the German original, "equal right" is "das gleiche Recht," and "bourgeois right" is "das bürgerliche Recht"; in the Russian translation, "equal right" is "равное право," and "bourgeois right" is "буржуазное право." The words "Recht" in German and "право" in Russian have several meanings, one of which is "right"; another is the general term for laws and regulations formulated by the state, which was previously translated as "law" or "right."
    The Chinese translation of "Critique of the Gotha Program" is inconsistent in its translation of the word Recht (право). In the first half of the aforementioned sentence, it is translated as "right," but in the second half, it is translated as "right." Furthermore, in the context of Marx's sentence, this word appears more than ten times, and everywhere else it is translated as "right," except in the sentence "Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby," where it is translated as "right." The Chinese translation of Lenin's "State and Revolution" has a similar situation in the translation of this term.
    Judging from the content of Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Chapter 1 of "Critique of the Gotha Program" and Lenin's explanation in "State and Revolution," it is inappropriate to interpret the same word Recht (право) as having two meanings in the same sentence; it is more accurate to translate it consistently as "right." This is because Marx is discussing the issue of the socialist distribution system from the perspective of rights, from the perspective of fairness and equality, rather than from the perspective of laws and regulations. The "Gotha Program" advocated that under socialism, "fair distribution" should be implemented, and each member of society should have the "equal right" to obtain the same labor products. This was a petty-bourgeois fallacy of Lassalle, which Marx refuted. Based on the principle of expanded reproduction in society, after deeply analyzing Lassalle's mistakes and the distribution situation in socialist society, Marx pointed out that although inequality in people's relationship to the means of production has been eliminated under socialism, and the system of exploitation has been eliminated, and every member of society is treated equally according to the labor he provides to society; however, due to the different specific situations of each member of society (ability, physical condition, family burden, etc.), there are still inequalities in the material resources enjoyed by people. Therefore, Marx said, "Here, equal right is still in principle bourgeois right."
    The English and Japanese translations of these two books also translate this sentence as "bourgeois-style rights." The English translation translates "Recht" (право) as "right," meaning right, not as "law," meaning "law." In Japanese, there are also two ways to translate the word Recht (право), one is to translate it as "法" (law) or "法律" (law) in the sense of law; the other is to translate it as "権利" (right). In the Japanese translations of these two books, it is translated as "権利" (right). It can be seen that the translators of the English and Japanese versions also understood the word Recht (право) used by Marx and Lenin here to mean "right."
    As early as 1939, He Sijing and Xu Bing translated "Critique of the Gotha Program" in Yan'an in this way, translating Marx's sentence as: "Therefore, here, equal right is still in principle the right of the bourgeois." Later, the "Selected Works of Marx and Engels" (two-volume edition) and the "Selected Works of Lenin" (two-volume edition) changed this term to "bourgeois right." Last year, when we translated "Complete Works of Lenin" Volume 25 (containing "State and Revolution"), we did not carefully consider it and followed this translation. This was an undesirable oversight in our work.
    Based on the above, we believe that it is more appropriate to change all places in the Chinese translations of Marx's "Critique of the Gotha Program" and Lenin's "State and Revolution" that are translated as "bourgeois right" or "bourgeois right" to "bourgeois-style rights." This change in translation does not affect our basic understanding of the issue of "bourgeois right," and it can also avoid some confusion and misunderstanding. Recently, in the translation of Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union in 1959-1965 at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the translation "bourgeois-style rights" has already been used.

### 对于“资产阶级法权”一语译法的意见

    对于“资产阶级法权”一语译法的意见
    中共中央  马克思  恩格斯  列宁　斯大林  著作编译局副局长　张仲实
    关于“资产阶级法权”一语的译法问题，最近我们又作了研究，认为此语改译做“资产阶级式的权利”，比较符合原意。
    近来习用的“资产阶级法权”一语是根据马克思著“哥达纲领批判”一书中文译本中下面这句话而提出的，即：“这里平等的权利在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权”（见“马克思恩格斯文选”第二卷22页）。这句话在德文原文里边，“平等的权利”是“das gleiche Recht”，“资产阶级式的法权”是“das bürgerliche Recht”；在俄文译本里边，“平等的权利”是“равное　право”，“资产阶级式的法权”是“буржуазное　право”。德文中的“Recht”和俄文中的“право”这个字都有好几个意思，其中有一个意思是权利；又有一个意思是国家所制定的法律规章的总称，过去有的译做“法”，有的译做“法权”。
    “哥达纲领批判”一书中文译本对Recht（俄文право）这个字的译法是不统一的。在前述那句话的上半句里把它译做“权利”，下半句里却译成了“法权”。其次，在马克思的这句话的上下文里，这个字出现了十多次，所有其他地方都译成了“权利”，而在“法权永不能超过社会经济制度以及由此经济制度所决定的社会文化发展程度”一句中却译成了“法权”。列宁著“国家与革命”一书中文译本中，对此语的译法也有同样的情形。
    从“哥达纲领批判”一书第一章第1、2、3节的内容和列宁在“国家与革命”一书中的解释看来，把Recht（право ）这同一个字在同一句话里解释成两个意思，是不妥当的；统通译做“权利”，比较确切。因为马克思在这里是从权利的角度，从是否公平、平等的角度来讲社会主义的分配制度问题的，而不是从法律规章的角度来讲这个问题的。“哥达纲领”中主张：在社会主义之下实行“公平的分配”，社会的每个成员都有获得同等劳动产品的“平等权利”。这是拉萨尔的一种小资产阶级的谬论，马克思就是驳斥这种谬论的。马克思根据社会扩大再生产的原理，在深入地分析了拉萨尔的错误和社会主义社会的分配情况以后，指出：在社会主义之下，虽然在人们对生产资料的关系方面已经消灭了不平等，消灭了剥削制度，对于社会的每个成员都一律平等地按照他提供给社会的劳动进行分配；但是，由于社会成员各人的具体情况（能力、身体、家庭负担等）不同，因而，人们所享有的物质资料仍有不平等现象。因此，马克思说，“这里的平等权利在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的权利”。
    而这两本书的英文和日文译本，也都把这句话译做“资产阶级式的权利”。英文译本把“Recht”（право）译做“right”，即权利的意思，不是译做“law”，即“法”、“法律”的意思。日文里对于Recht（право）一词也有两种译法，一种是在法律的意义上译做“法”或“法律”；另一种译为“权利”。而在这两本书的日文译本中都译为“权利”。可见，英、日文译本的译者也都是把马克思和列宁在这里所用的Recht（право）一词理解为“权利”的意思。
    早在一九三九年何思敬、徐冰同志在延安翻译的“哥达纲领批判”中，也是这样翻译的，他们把马克思的那句话译成：“所以此地，平等的权利在原则上仍然是资产者的权利。”后来，“马克思恩格斯文选”（两卷集）本和“列宁文选”（两卷集）本才把此语改译做“资产阶级式的法权”。去年我们在翻译“列宁全集”第二十五卷（内有“国家与革命”一书）时，没有仔细推敲，就沿用了这个译法。这是我们工作中的一种不应有的疏忽。
    根据上述情况，我们认为，将马克思著“哥达纲领批判”和列宁著“国家与革命”两书中文译本中凡译“资产阶级式的法权”或“资产阶级的法权”的地方，都改译为“资产阶级式的权利”，比较恰当。这样改译，并不影响我们对于“资产阶级法权”问题的基本理解，而且还可以免除一些混乱和误解。最近在赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上关于苏联1959—1965年发展国民经济控制数字的报告的翻译中就已经用了“资产阶级式的权利”这个译语。
