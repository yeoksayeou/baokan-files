Xinhua News Agency, March 24th, Havana Dispatch: 100,000 working people in Cuba held a huge demonstration and rally in front of the Presidential Palace in Havana, the capital, on the 22nd, to resolutely protest the recent conspiracy activities of American reactionary groups and American propaganda agencies aimed at overthrowing the Cuban interim government.

    Cuban Prime Minister Castro spoke at the meeting. He vehemently criticized the movement promoted by the reactionary American newspapers. The purpose of this movement is to overthrow the current government and restore the bloody Batista dictatorship.

    Castro pointed out, "The Cuban revolution is opposed by domestic reactionaries and international reactionaries, because the news propaganda movement of the international communications monopoly organizations has already resonated in the reactionary newspapers throughout the continent, and these reactionary newspapers have published the lies and slanders of the communications agencies." Castro emphasized that the reactionary foreign news agencies "talk more about any war criminals who are executed, but talk very little about the 20,000 crimes committed by Batista here. Why is this? First of all, to isolate us, and then to attack us. To make us lose the public sympathy of the people of the various countries of the continent, and then attack us from the base in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic)."

    Castro condemned the American reactionaries and the American government for attempting to economically strangle Cuba by reducing the quota of American sugar imported into Cuba. He also accused the United States of transporting weapons to Batista and the Dominican Republic, while the American "Federal Bureau of Investigation did not even find a small pistol in the hands of the bandits."

    Castro finally called on the Cuban people—including women and children—to implement full mobilization "to repel the counter-revolutionary offensives that may be launched from Florida (in the United States) and the Dominican Republic." He expressed support for the proposal to hold the May Day Labor People's Congress.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana Dispatch: The Cuban People's Socialist Party recently issued a statement on the domestic situation, calling on the people to be vigilant against the destructive conspiracy of US imperialism.

    The statement pointed out that the destruction carried out by imperialism and counter-revolutionary forces in the economic field has put the Cuban economy in serious difficulties.

    The statement revealed that while US imperialism is expressing "leniency" and "friendliness" to the new regime, on the other hand, it is arming Batista's counter-revolutionary movement and sending agents to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to carry out divisive propaganda. The People's Socialist Party called on people to be vigilant against US imperialism overthrowing the Cuban revolution under the pretext of resisting communism, using counterfeit "revolutions," just like what it did in Guatemala in the past.

    In order to protect the revolution and ensure its progress, the People's Socialist Party demanded the adoption of the following important measures in the statement, including: reorganizing all the armed forces of the Republic to make them a disciplined force armed with military knowledge and revolutionary education and spirit; organizing comprehensive and central intelligence agencies in order to uncover conspiracy activities and counter-revolutionary plans; rectifying and organizing the work of the interim revolutionary government; and strengthening the unity of all organized revolutionary forces.

    古巴总理卡斯特罗在哈瓦那十万人的群众大会上
    号召全民动员击败美国侵略阴谋
    古巴人民社会党揭露美国阴谋并要求进一步巩固共和国和军队
    新华社24日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴十万名劳动人民22日在首都哈瓦那总统府前面举行了巨大的示威游行和集会，坚决抗议美国反动集团和美国的宣传机构最近掀起的旨在推翻古巴临时政府的阴谋活动。
    古巴总理卡斯特罗在会上讲了话。他猛烈抨击美国反动报纸所鼓吹的运动。这个运动的目的是要推翻现政府和使血腥的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权复辟。
    卡斯特罗指出，“古巴革命遭到国内反动派和国际反动派的反对，因为国际通讯社垄断机构的新闻宣传运动已经在整个大陆的反动报纸上得到反响，这些反动报纸发表了通讯社的谎言和诬蔑。”卡斯特罗强调说，反动的外国通讯社“对任何一个被处决的战争罪犯谈得多，而对巴蒂斯塔在这里犯下的二万项罪行却谈得很少。这是为什么？首先是要孤立我们，然后打击我们。使我们失掉大陆各国人民的公众同情，然后从（多米尼加共和国）圣多明各的基地进攻我们。”
    卡斯特罗谴责美国反动派和美国政府试图减少美国输入古巴食糖的限额，来从经济上扼杀古巴。他还指责美国把武器运给巴蒂斯塔和多米尼加，而美国的“联邦调查局连匪徒手中的一支小手枪都没有发现”。
    卡斯特罗最后号召古巴人民——包括妇女和儿童在内——实行全面动员，“以击退来自（美国的）佛罗里达州和多米尼加共和国可能发动的反革命进攻”。他表示支持举行五一劳动人民大会的主张。
    据新华社讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴人民社会党最近就国内局势发表声明，号召人民警惕美帝国主义的破坏阴谋。
    声明指出，帝国主义和反革命势力在经济方面所进行的破坏，使古巴经济面临着严重的困难。
    声明揭露说，美帝国主义一方面在对新政权表示“宽大”和“友好”，另一方面却在武装巴蒂斯塔的反革命运动，并且派遣特务渗入革命队伍中进行分裂宣传。人民社会党号召人们警惕美帝国主义在抵御共产主义的借口下，用冒牌的“革命”来推翻古巴的革命，就像过去在危地马拉所干的勾当。
    为了保护革命和保证革命取得进展，人民社会党在声明中要求采取下列重要措施，其中包括：改组共和国的一切武装部队，使他们成为一支以军事知识以及革命教育和精神武装起来的有纪律的部队；组织全面的和中央的情报机构，以便破获阴谋活动和反革命计划；整顿和组织临时革命政府的工作；加强一切有组织的革命力量的团结。
