Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 4th: "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published today the draft of the Soviet-British Treaty of Non-Aggression proposed by the Soviet Union.

    During British Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviet government suggested the conclusion of a Soviet-British Treaty of Non-Aggression. On February 28th, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko handed this draft treaty to British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. The draft treaty has six articles.

    The draft treaty states:

    “The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on the one hand, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on the other,

    Affirming their desire to strive for peaceful coexistence with each other and with all countries, affirming their determination to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter in international relations,

    Willing to contribute to the improvement of the international situation, particularly the situation in Europe, by taking measures aimed at maintaining peace and building an atmosphere of trust in relations between countries,

    Have decided to conclude this Treaty of Non-Aggression."

    Article 1 of the draft treaty states: "The Contracting Parties point out that the use of force or the threat of force in international relations is prohibited by the United Nations Charter, and therefore solemnly declare that they will renounce aggression and will not use force or the threat of force against each other."

    Article 2 states: "The Contracting Parties believe that the establishment of military bases on foreign territory will cause suspicion in international relations, lead to the sharpening of the international situation, and deepen the danger of a new war. Therefore, they should undertake obligations not to allow the establishment of foreign military bases on their territory. Accordingly, measures will be taken to eliminate all existing foreign military bases within the shortest possible period."

    Article 3 reads: "All disputes that may arise between the Contracting Parties shall be resolved in a spirit of mutual understanding, through negotiations and other means of peaceful settlement of international disputes as stipulated in the United Nations Charter."

    Article 4 of the draft treaty declares: "If any country uses force or the threat of force against one of the Contracting Parties, the other Contracting Party will not provide direct or indirect support to the country using force or the threat of force, and will take all possible measures on its part to mediate the conflict peacefully."

    Article 5 of the draft treaty states that the treaty shall be valid for twenty years from the date of its entry into force.

    Article 6 of the draft treaty states: "Any European country, as well as the United States of America, may accede to this treaty."

    苏联向英国提出苏英互不侵犯条约草案
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：“真理报”和“消息报”今天发表了苏联提出的苏英互不侵犯条约草案。
    在英国首相麦克米伦访问苏联期间，苏联政府曾经建议缔结苏英互不侵犯条约。2月28日，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯把这项条约草案交给了英国外交大臣劳埃德。条约草案共有六条。
    条约草案说：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为一方，大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国为另一方，
    确认自己具有力求彼此和平共处并同一切国家和平共处的愿望，确认有决心在国际关系中遵循联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，
    愿意采取旨在维护和平和建立各国关系中的信任气氛的措施来对改善国际局势、特别是欧洲的局势，作出自己的贡献。
    决定缔结本互不侵犯条约。”
    条约草案第一条说：“缔约双方指出，在国际关系中使用武力或武力威胁是联合国宪章所禁止的，因此庄严表示，它们将放弃侵犯，彼此将不使用武力或武力威胁。”
    第二条说：“缔约双方认为，在别国领土上建立军事基地会在国际关系中引起猜疑，导致国际局势尖锐化和加深新战争危险，因此，应承担义务，不允许在本国领土上建立外国军事基地。据此，将采取措施，在尽可能短的期间内撤消现有的一切外国军事基地。”
    第三条写道：“缔约双方之间可能出现的一切争端，均将本着互相谅解的精神，通过谈判和联合国宪章所规定的和平解决国际争端的其它办法来解决。”
    条约草案第四条宣布：“如果某一国家对缔约一方使用武力或武力威胁，缔约另一方将不给予使用武力或武力威胁的国家以直接或间接的支持，并将从自己方面采取一切可能的措施来和平调解冲突。”
    草案第五条指出，条约在生效之日起的二十年内有效。
    条约草案第六条说：“任何一个欧洲国家，以及美利坚合众国都可以加入本条约。”
