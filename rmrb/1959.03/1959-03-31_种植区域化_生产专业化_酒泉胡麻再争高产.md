Regionalized Planting, Specialized Production
	Jiuquan's Flax Strives for High Yield Again
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Jiuquan, March 30th) On the basis of last year's large-scale flax bumper harvest, Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, has put forward the slogan of "Vigorously develop oil production and strive to meet the oil target this year," determined to ensure that each person in the city owns twenty catties of vegetable oil this year, in order to thoroughly implement the policy of simultaneous leaps forward in grain, cotton, and oil.
    In order to achieve this goal, the city's flax planting area has been expanded to more than 38,000 mu, with an average yield of 300 catties per mu, of which 20% of the high-yield fields should reach 1,000 to 1,500 catties per mu; 320,000 people in the city will also use field ridges and all available idle land to plant 300 sunflower plants or 100 castor bean plants per person.
    Jiuquan City has a long history of planting flax, which is the main raw material for local edible vegetable oil, but it has not received the attention it deserves in the past, and the yield has always been only around 100 catties. This year, in order to raise oil production to the same important position as grain and cotton, the Municipal Party Committee recently held a special telephone conference to make specific arrangements before sowing; each commune has assigned a Party Committee Secretary or Commune Leader to take charge of oil production. Under the principles of regionalized planting and specialized production, all production teams have made land and labor plans according to unified arrangements, established oil production bases, and formed oil production professional teams or groups. They have also run short-term training courses through various means, and each production team has trained about two oil crop cultivation technicians.
    At present, the pre-sowing land leveling, fertilizer transportation, fertilization, seed selection, and seed treatment work that the city's farmers are carrying out is about to be completed; planting will also begin in early April. (Lan Ping)

    种植区域化　生产专业化
    酒泉胡麻再争高产
    本报酒泉30日电  甘肃省酒泉市在去年胡麻大面积丰收的基础上，提出了“大力发展油料生产，力争今年油料过关”的口号，决心使全市人民今年每人拥有植物油二十斤，以彻底贯彻粮棉油共同跃进的方针。
    为实现这一目标，全市胡麻播种面积已扩大到三万八千余亩，每亩平均产量要达到三百斤，其中20％的丰产田亩产要达到一千斤至一千五百斤；全市三十二万群众还将利用地头埂和一切空闲地，每人种三百株向日葵或一百株蓖麻。
    酒泉市种植胡麻已有很长的历史，为当地食用植物油的主要原料，但过去没有得到应有的重视，产量始终只在百斤上下。今年为把油料生产提高到和粮棉同等重要的地位，市委最近又专门召开电话会议，作了播种前的具体布置；各公社都抽出一位党委书记或社长抓油料生产。在种植区域化、生产专业化的原则下，所有生产队都根据统一安排作出土地劳力规划，建立了油料生产基地，成立了油料生产专业队或小组，并通过各种方式开办了短期训练班，每个生产队都培养了两名左右油料栽培技术员。
    目前，全市农民正紧张进行的播前平整土地、运肥、施肥、选种及种籽处理工作，即将告竣；种植亦将提前于4月中旬开始。（蓝坪）
