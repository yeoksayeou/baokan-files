Xinhua News Agency, Changchun – Jilin Province, a renowned soybean-producing region in China, will strive to expand its soybean planting area this year to meet the state's need for commercial oil crops. The proportion of the total sown area dedicated to soybeans across the province will increase from 18.8% last year to over 21% this year.

    Many people's communes in Jilin Province have launched a spring farming upsurge, putting forward the slogan to "resolutely remove the low-yield label from soybeans." Yushu County, known as the "Home of Soybeans," also plans to double its soybean output this year compared to last year. Currently, all forty people's communes in the county have made practical arrangements for soybean production, ensuring the implementation of land plots, targets, measures, and tasks, and have launched a high tide of land preparation and moisture conservation.

    给大豆摘低产帽子
    吉林加强备耕工作
  　据新华社长春电　我国大豆著名产区吉林省，今年将尽力扩大大豆播种面积，以满足国家对于商品油料的需要。全省大豆播种面积所占总播种面积的比重，将由去年的18.8％提高到今年的21％以上。
    吉林省许多人民公社都掀起了备耕热潮，他们提出口号，要“坚决摘掉大豆低产帽子”。号称大豆之乡的榆树县，今年的大豆产量也计划比去年增加一倍左右。目前全县四十个人民公社都对大豆生产作了切实的安排，作到了地块、指标、措施、任务四落实，并掀起了整地，保墒生产高潮。
