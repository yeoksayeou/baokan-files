Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 20th: In order to mobilize the nation's scientific and technological forces and extensively and deeply carry out the mass technical revolution movement, the National Science and Technology Association recently held its first National Science and Technology Association Work Conference in Hangzhou. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including responsible cadres from science and technology associations in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as representatives from grassroots science and technology association organizations in some people's communes, factories, and mines. Based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of the past year, and discussed and arranged the work of the Science and Technology Association for 1959.

The meeting discussed and decided on the general task of the China Association for Science and Technology in 1959. This general task is: Under the leadership of the Party, to go all out, aim high, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses in every possible way, closely cooperate with relevant parties, promote a broader and deeper mass technical revolution movement, greatly improve labor productivity, and strive to realize the 1959 national economic plan and the national science and technology development plan. Based on this general task, the meeting formulated the "Main Points of the 1959 National Science and Technology Association Work Plan (Draft)," focusing on the key scientific and technological issues in this year's steel, coal, grain, and cotton production tasks, and formulated a plan for professional activities of mass organizations. The focus of activities is on people's communes, factories, and mines. The meeting required science and technology associations at all levels to quickly organize scientific and technological forces to vigorously summarize and promote the creative inventions and technological reform achievements of the masses in 1958.

In the past year of the Great Leap Forward, especially since the first National Congress of the Science and Technology Association in September last year, the work of the Science and Technology Association has developed rapidly under the leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, and on the basis of the work of the original Science and Technology Association and Popular Science Association. Many science and technology associations in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have done a lot of work in the movements of deep plowing, tool reform, and the whole people running iron and steel. Science and technology association organizations at all levels have also been gradually established and improved in the technical revolution movement. According to incomplete statistics, among the 1,699 counties (cities) in 25 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, 1,399 counties (cities) have established science and technology associations. In more than 7,000 rural people's communes in ten provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, about 4,000 grassroots organizations of science and technology associations have been established. By the end of 1958, the National Science and Technology Association had approximately 6 million members. In order to ensure the completion of this year's work tasks of the Science and Technology Association, the meeting emphasized that science and technology association organizations at all levels should continue to implement the general policy decided by the first National Congress of the Science and Technology Association last year – resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, boldly mobilize the masses, closely integrate with production, rapidly strengthen the scientific and technological ranks, and constantly push the mass technical revolution movement to a new climax.

The meeting believes that to complete this year's huge and glorious tasks, science and technology association organizations at all levels and all members still need to make arduous efforts. Therefore, the meeting requested science and technology associations at all levels to immediately grasp mass scientific and technological professional activities. In addition to a few long-term scientific and technological research activities that cannot be effective immediately, most of the professional activities should quickly have an effect on industrial and agricultural production, and effectively correct the shortcomings of "planning in isolation and abstractly linking with production." In terms of organization, it is required to develop organizations in accordance with the policy of "actively developing, steadily advancing, consolidating and improving," and quickly organize the backbone that has emerged in the mass technical revolution movement to encourage and promote the broad masses to continuously carry out the technical revolution. Regarding the various specialized societies of natural sciences, the meeting once again clarified its role. It believes that it is an organization that carries out mass professional activities under the leadership of the Science and Technology Association and should actively play its role. Finally, the meeting requested that cadres of science and technology associations at all levels should have a firm service attitude, be good at coordinating with all parties to carry out work, strive to study dialectical materialism, exercise their ideological methods, oppose metaphysics, learn the working methods of the mass line, and cultivate themselves into excellent mass workers. Only in this way can they, under the leadership of the Party, take on the task of further promoting the mass technical revolution movement.

    把群众性的技术革命推向新高潮
    全国科协工作会议决定广泛开展科学技术活动
    新华社杭州20日电　全国科学技术协会为了动员全国科学技术力量，广泛深入地开展群众性的技术革命运动，不久前在杭州举行了第一次全国科协工作会议。参加会议的有各省、市、自治区科协和部分全国性专门学会负责干部以及若干人民公社和厂矿基层科协组织的代表共一百余人。会议根据党的八届六中全会精神，总结了去年的成绩和经验，讨论和安排了科协1959年的工作。
    会议讨论决定了中国科协在1959年总的任务。这个总任务是：在党的领导下，鼓足革命干劲，千方百计调动广大群众积极性，与有关方面密切合作，促进一个更加广阔、更加深入的技术革命群众运动，大大提高劳动生产率，为实现1959年国民经济计划和国家科学技术发展计划而奋斗。根据这一总的任务，会议制定了1959年全国科协工作规划要点（草案），以今年钢、煤、粮、棉生产任务的关键性的科学技术问题为中心，订出了群众团体的专业活动的计划。活动的对象以人民公社和厂矿为重点。会议要求各级科协迅速组织科学技术力量，大力总结和推广1958年群众的创造发明和技术改革成果。
    在过去跃进的一年中，特别是在去年9月科协第一次全国代表大会以后，科协工作在中央和各级党委领导下，在原科联、科普的工作基础上获得了迅速的发展。许多省、市、自治区科协在深翻土地、工具改革和全民大办钢铁的运动中作了许多工作。科协各级组织也在技术革命运动中逐步建立和健全起来。据不完全统计，在二十五个省、市、自治区一千六百九十九个县（市）中，已有一千三百九十九个县（市）建立了科协。在十个省、市、自治区七千多个农村人民公社中已建立约四千多个科协基层组织。全国科协现有会员，到1958年底约计已达六百万人左右。为了保证今年科协工作任务的完成，会议强调指出：各级科协组织，应当继续贯彻去年科协第一次全国代表大会决定的总方针——坚决依靠党的领导、放手发动群众、密切结合生产、迅速壮大科学技术队伍、把技术革命群众运动不断推向新的高潮。
    会议认为，要完成今年的巨大而光荣的任务，科协各级组织和全体会员，还需要进行艰苦的努力。因此会议要求各级科协立即抓群众性的科学技术专业活动。除少数带长远性的不可能马上见效的科学技术研究活动外，要使专业活动的大部分工作能在工农业生产上迅速发生效果，切实改正“孤立进行规划，抽象联系生产”的缺点。在组织上则要求按照“积极发展，稳步前进，巩固提高”的方针发展组织，迅速把技术革命群众运动中出现的骨干组织起来，以鼓舞和推动广大群众不断进行技术革命。对于各自然科学专门学会，会议再一次明确了它的作用。认为它是科协领导下进行群众性专业活动的组织，应当积极发挥它的作用。会议最后要求各级科协干部要有坚定的服务态度，善于协同各方面开展工作，要努力学习辩证唯物论，锻炼自己的思想方法，反对形而上学，学习群众路线的工作方法，把自己培养成为优秀的群众工作者。只有这样，才能在党的领导下，把进一步推动群众性的技术革命运动的任务担当起来。
