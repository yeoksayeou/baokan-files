    Stop the Lao Royal Government from Undermining the Geneva Accords
    By a commentator for this newspaper

    Today, this newspaper publishes a letter from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, to Lieutenant General Tara Singh Bal, Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, exposing the various crimes of the United States and the Lao Royal Government in undermining the Geneva Accords, particularly in retaliating against and persecuting former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and members of the Lao Patriotic Party. Every peace-loving and fair-minded person cannot help but feel indignant about this.
    Prime Minister of the Lao Kingdom, Phoui Sananikone, in his statement openly declaring the unilateral abandonment of the Geneva Accords and opposing the continued activity of the International Commission for Laos, which oversees the implementation of the Geneva Accords, used the reason that the Lao Kingdom had completed its responsibility to fulfill the Geneva Accords and no longer had any obligation to abide by the Geneva Accords. However, the actual situation is completely different.
    Article 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulates that "no reprisals or discrimination shall be taken against persons or organizations for their activities during the war and against their family members." Article 15 of the Geneva Agreement "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos" stipulates: "Each party undertakes to refrain from any reprisals or discrimination against any persons or organizations for their activities during the war and guarantees their democratic freedoms." The Lao Royal Government also made a guarantee in its statement at the Geneva Conference: "Determined to take effective measures to unite all citizens in the common life of the nation without any discrimination and to ensure that they enjoy the rights and freedoms stipulated by the Kingdom's Constitution." In fact, however, since August 1958, when the pro-American reactionary forces in Laos represented by Sananikone came to power, the Lao Royal Government's discrimination and retaliatory actions against former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and other Lao patriotic and democratic figures have intensified. The Lao Royal Government even imitated the United States' "House Un-American Activities Committee" and established an organization called the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" to carry out barbaric suppression of the people. From Sam Neua and Phong Saly in the north to Attopeu in the south, whether it is Luang Prabang or Savannakhet, former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and other patriotic and democratic figures are being innocently killed and arrested everywhere. The charges are all trumped up, but in reality, it is simply because they demanded that the Royal Government guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords, or even simply because they participated in the election activities of the Lao Patriotic Party or read newspapers of the Lao Patriotic Party, even though the Patriotic Party has a completely legal status according to the political agreement on domestic peace and unity in Laos.
    At the same time, regarding the various clauses for the merger of the Lao Royal Army and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the Sananikone government not only did not continue to fulfill its obligations, but instead recalled public officials of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units who had already been appointed and selected, completely undermining the agreement. This has made the political settlement stipulated in Article 14 of the Geneva Accords long overdue. In addition, the United States' massive military aid to Laos, the import of large quantities of new weapons, the dispatch of Filipino-American Air Force personnel, the construction of strategic highways and airports, the establishment of American military bases, and the urgent attempt to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, also violate the clear provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, namely that the Lao government shall not accept foreign military aid, shall not participate in military alliances, and shall not provide military bases for foreign countries; and the Lao Royal Government's guarantee in its statement at the Geneva Conference that "it will never participate in a policy of aggression."
    Obviously, the reason why the Lao Royal Government publicly issued the deceptive argument that it has "completely fulfilled the Geneva Accords" is merely to obstruct the continued activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, so that it can further persecute members of the Lao Patriotic Party and former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and clear the way for completely relying on U.S. imperialism and joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. All of this is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords.
    The letter from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to the Indian government on January 31, 1959, clearly pointed out that the decision of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos to suspend its activities indefinitely, but to reconvene through normal procedures, does not affect the legal status of the International Commission for Laos, nor does it reduce the authority of the International Commission for Laos in performing the tasks and responsibilities stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The two chairmen also agreed that the International Commission for Laos' decision of July 19, 1958, to suspend its activities indefinitely was a procedural decision that had nothing to do with the dissolution of the International Commission for Laos. The two chairmen believe that this does not involve the abolition of any of the provisions relating to the International Commission in the Lao Ceasefire Agreement, in particular Article 39. We believe that in order to promptly stop the acts of retaliation and discrimination against former Lao resistance personnel, members of the Lao Patriotic Party, and all patriotic people, to safeguard the independence and freedom of Laos, to prevent the United States from turning Laos into a base of aggression and undermining peace in the Indochina Peninsula, it is imperative that the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos immediately resume its activities in Laos.

    制止老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议
    本报评论员
    今天，本报发表了老挝爱国党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王写给老挝国际委员会主席塔拉·辛格·巴尔中将的一封信，揭露了美国和老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议、特别是对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党人进行报复和迫害的种种罪行。每一个爱好和平和有正义感的人，对此不能不表示愤慨。
    老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空在公然宣布片面废弃日内瓦协议、反对监督日内瓦协议实施的老挝国际委员会继续进行活动的声明中，曾以老挝王国已经完成了履行日内瓦协议的责任、已再无遵守日内瓦协议的义务为理由。可是，实际情况完全不是这样。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第九条曾明确规定“不得对战时曾以任何方式参加对方合作的人员或其家属加以个别或集体的报复”。日内瓦协议“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定”第十五条规定：“每方不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而采取任何报复和歧视，并保证他们的民主自由。”老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议的声明中也作过保证：“决心采取有效措施，俾使全体公民不受任何歧视地团结在全国共同生活中，并保证他们享受王国宪法所规定的权利和自由。”然而事实上，从1958年8月以萨纳尼空为代表的老挝亲美反动势力执政以后，老挝王国政府对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝其他爱国民主人士的歧视和报复行动，变本加厉。老挝王国政府甚至效法美国的“非美活动调查委员会”，成立所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的机构，对人民进行野蛮的镇压。从北方的桑怒、丰沙里，到南方的阿速坡，不论是琅勃刺邦或是沙湾拿吉，到处都有前寮国战斗部队人员和其他爱国民主人士被无辜杀害和逮捕。罪名都是莫须有的，实际上只是因为他们要求王国政府保证日内瓦协议的实施，甚至仅仅是因为他们参加了老挝爱国党的竞选活动或读了老挝爱国党的报纸，尽管根据老挝国内和平团结的政治协议，爱国党具有完全合法的地位。
    同时，对于老挝王国军队和前寮国战斗部队根据日内瓦协议的规定进行合并的各项条款，萨纳尼空政府不但不继续履行自己的义务，相反却召回已经任用和选用的前寮国战斗部队的公职人员，完全破坏了协议。这就使得日内瓦协议第十四条规定的政治解决迟迟不得实现。此外，美国对老挝进行大量军事援助，运入大批新武器，派去菲籍美国空军人员，修筑战略公路和飞机场，建立美国的军事基地，以及亟图把老挝拉入东南亚军事集团，也违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第四条和第五条的明确规定，即老挝政府不得接受外国军事援助、不得参加军事同盟、不得为外国提供军事基地；以及老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议的声明中保证的“永不参与侵略政策”。
    显而易见，老挝王国政府所以公开发出“已经完全履行日内瓦协议”的欺骗论调，不过是为了阻挠老挝国际监督和监察委员会继续进行活动，便于它进一步迫害老挝爱国党人和前寮国战斗部队，为完全投靠美帝国主义、加入东南亚军事集团扫清道路。这一切都是对日内瓦协议的严重破坏。
    日内瓦会议两位主席1959年1月31日写给印度政府的信明确指出：老挝国际监察和监督委员会决定无限期停止活动，但是可以根据正常程序重新复会，这一决议并不影响老挝国际委员会的法律地位，也不减少老挝国际委员会在执行日内瓦协议所规定的任务和职责方面的权限。两位主席还一致认为，老挝国际委员会1958年7月19日关于无限期停止活动的决议，是程序性的决定，同解散老挝国际委员会的问题没有任何关系。两位主席认为，这毫不涉及废止老挝停止敌对行动协定中有关国际委员会的任何条款，特别是第三十九条。我们认为，为了及时制止对老挝前抗战人员、老挝爱国党人和一切爱国人士实行报复和歧视的行为，维护老挝的独立和自由，阻止美国把老挝变成侵略基地和破坏印度支那半岛的和平，老挝国际监察和监督委员会立即恢复在老挝的活动已经刻不容缓。
