    Helping the United Arab Republic with Construction
    Soviet Equipment Arrives in the UAR
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 23rd: TASS Cairo, March 23rd: A large quantity of industrial equipment is now being transported from the Soviet Union to the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic. This equipment will be used in enterprises being built in the UAR with Soviet assistance.
    Equipment for one of the three spinning mills that the Soviet Union promised to provide has already been completely shipped. This factory will be built in Damietta. Since last November, more than twenty ships have sailed from the Soviet Union to the UAR. Officials from the UAR's Egyptian region's Five-Year Plan for Industrialization Authority said that it is particularly worth noting that Soviet equipment always arrives on schedule.

    据新华社24日讯  塔斯社开罗23日讯：大批的工业装备现在正从苏联运到阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区。这些装备将用在由苏联帮助阿联建设的企业中。
    在苏联答应提供的三座纺纱厂设备中有一座工厂的设备已经全部运到，这座工厂将修建在丹密塔。去年11月以来，已经有二十多艘船从苏联开到阿联。埃及地区工业化五年计划执行当局的人士说，特别值得指出的是，苏联装备总是如期运到的。
