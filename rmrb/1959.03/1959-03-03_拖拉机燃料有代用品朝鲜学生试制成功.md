    Substitute Fuel for Tractors
    Successfully Trial-Produced by Korean Students
    Students in the tractor research group at the Seongcheon Agricultural Mechanization Specialized School in South Pyongan Province, Korea, successfully trial-produced a substitute fuel for tractors using peat and anthracite coal.
    On January 16 this year, they drove tractors using this new fuel for over two hundred li to Pyongyang, proving that the effectiveness of this substitute fuel is very good.
    The method of making this substitute fuel is: mixing peat, anthracite coal, and ammonia solution together to make pellets the size of candies.  By installing a gas generator and a centrifugal gas purifier on the tractor, these pellets can be used as fuel. According to experimental results, a tractor consumes 160 kilograms of this substitute fuel in eight hours of operation, and the cost is only 3.5% of that of gasoline.  Large trucks, water pumps, threshing machines, etc. can also use this substitute fuel.
    This new creation by the Korean students can enable agricultural cooperatives in Korea to solve their own tractor fuel problems.
    This valuable creation by the Korean students is the fruit of the Korean Workers' Party's educational policy of combining learning with production. (Jin Xingji)

    拖拉机燃料有代用品
    朝鲜学生试制成功
    朝鲜平安南道成川农业机械化专门学校拖拉机研究小组的学生，用泥煤和无烟煤试制拖拉机燃料代用品成功。
    今年1月16日，他们用这种新的燃料驾驶拖拉机，跑了二百多里，到了平壤，证明这种代用燃料的效能很好。
    这种代用燃料的制法是：把泥煤、无烟煤同氨溶液搅拌起来，做成糖果那样大的丸子。在拖拉机上安装了煤气发生炉和远心煤气清净机，就可以用这种丸子作燃料。据实验结果，一部拖拉机走八小时要消耗这种代用燃料一百六十公斤，所费成本只等于汽油的3.5％。大卡车、抽水机、打谷机等也可以用这种代用燃料。
    朝鲜学生的这一新创造，可以使朝鲜的农业合作社自己解决拖拉机的燃料问题。
    朝鲜学生这种有价值的创造，是朝鲜劳动党学习与生产相结合的教育政策的果实。（金星姬）
