Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The Soviet Leningrad "Zenith" football team played a friendly match against the Beijing football team in Beijing today. The guest team's national team player, center forward Malozov, scored a goal in each the first and second halves, resulting in a 2-0 victory for the visiting team.

    Over 20,000 spectators watched the "Zenith" football team's first match of their second visit to China at the Xiannongtan Stadium. Compared to their first visit to China three years ago, the visiting team's attack speed was faster today, and their coordination was more organized.

    Eighteen minutes after the start of the match, the visiting team's center forward Malozov received a quick pass from the left wing in front of the Beijing team's penalty area. He controlled the ball slightly and suddenly shot towards the opponent's goal. The shot was so sudden that Beijing's goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu didn't even have time to make a save, and the ball flew directly into the net from the lower left corner of the goal.

    In the second half, the visiting team's forwards were very active. The fast-running right inside forward Badanov and left inside forward Bondarenko frequently switched positions, pressing close to the Beijing team's penalty area. Six minutes into the second half, due to a coordination error between goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu and defender Sun Baorong while saving the ball, the visiting team's center forward Malozov shot the second goal into the unguarded net.

    Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi also watched this friendly match. After the game, they went to the field to shake hands with the players of both teams and took pictures together.

    苏泽尼特足球队胜北京队
    新华社11日讯　苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队今天在北京同北京足球队举行了友谊比赛。客队中的国家队员、中锋马洛卓夫在上、下半场各踢进一球，结果客队以二比零获胜。
    在先农坛体育场里，有两万多名观众观看了“泽尼特”足球队第二次访华的首次比赛。比起三年前第一次访问中国时的比赛情况，客队今天进攻速度更快，配合也更有条不紊了。
    在比赛开始后十八分钟时，客队中锋马洛卓夫在北京队禁区前接到从左边传来的一个快球，他稍带了一下球就冷不防向对方球门猛射，这个球来得那么突然，以至于北京队的守门员张俊秀还没有做扑球动作，球已经从球门左下角直飞入网。
    下半场客队的前锋十分活跃，奔跑迅速的右内锋巴丹诺夫和左内锋邦达连科等人经常交插换位，近逼北京队禁区。比赛进行了六分钟，主队由于守门员张俊秀和后卫孙宝荣救球时的配合错误，被客队中锋马洛卓夫向无人看守的空门射入了第二个球。
    贺龙和陈毅副总理也观看了这场友谊比赛。他们在这场球赛结束后，还曾到球场上同双方队员握手，并在一起照了像。
