Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 27th: The Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Recuperation Center's after-school performance troupe has recently concluded its tour performances across the country and returned to Chengdu, laden with accolades.

Since reporting its performances to the Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference and central leaders in the capital last May, this performance troupe has traveled across half of China in the past ten months. It has toured over 300 performances in twenty cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Jinan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Ruijin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, reaching over one million audience members. They have also given reports to people from all walks of life eighty-six times, with an audience of approximately 250,000 people, receiving over 5,000 gifts and 7,000 letters of appreciation.

During the performance troupe's performance in Beijing, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other central leading comrades watched their performances and received them.

People across the country have hailed this performance troupe as the embodiment of communist spirit. Many people who watched their performances were deeply moved and felt that they had received a profound communist education, expressing their determination to learn from these strongest individuals and to build our country with even greater enthusiasm. Li Qiaofeng, a female worker at the Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 7, gave birth to a daughter missing her right hand and had been saddened by the child's future. After watching Zhang Jiachen, who lost both hands, perform with the troupe, she was deeply moved and named her child "Xuechen" (学琛), expressing her desire for her child to learn from this strongest individual.

The care and love of the people and the vigorous development of construction across the motherland have given the performance troupe the greatest encouragement. Despite their physical disabilities, they also participated in voluntary labor at construction sites such as the Ming Tombs Reservoir in Beijing and the Xinlicheng Reservoir in Changchun. They also rehearsed while performing, learning many new musical and dance programs from literary and artistic workers in Northeast China, Guangzhou, and other places, and created approximately 400 works of various types, including songs, essays, dances, and dramas. The level of performance has greatly improved. They expressed that they will never fail the encouragement and care of the Party and the people, and will always be loyal to the Party and the people, contributing all their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    演出三百场　满载盛誉归
    四川革命残废军人教养院课余演出队回成都
    新华社成都27日电　四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队，已经在最近结束在全国各地的巡回演出，满载盛誉回到成都。
    这支演出队从去年5月在首都向第四次全国民政会议和中央首长汇报演出后，十个月来，走遍了半个中国，在北京、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、济南、南京、上海、瑞金、广州、武汉等二十个城市，巡回演出了三百多场，观众达一百多万人，为各界人士作报告八十六次，听众约二十五万人。收到各种礼品五千多件，慰问信七千多封。
    演出队在北京演出时，朱德副主席、周恩来总理等中央负责同志看了他们的演出，并接见了他们。
    各地人民把这支演出队称为共产主义精神的体现者。许多人看过他们的演出，都深受感动，认为是受到一次深刻的共产主义教育，纷纷表示决心，要向这些最坚强的人学习，以更大的干劲来建设我们的祖国。上海国棉七厂女工李巧凤生了一个缺右手的女儿，一直为孩子的将来伤心。她看了演出队失去双手的张家琛的演出后，深为激动，给孩子取名“学琛”，表示要孩子向这位最坚强的人学习。
    人们的关怀和热爱，祖国各地建设事业的蓬勃发展，给了演出队最大的鼓舞。虽然身体残废，他们也参加了北京十三陵水库、长春新立城水库等工地的义务劳动。他们还一边演出一边排练，向东北、广州等地文艺工作者学到许多新的音乐舞蹈节目，并且创作了歌曲、散文、舞蹈、戏剧等各类作品约四百件。演出水平有了很大提高。他们表示，决不辜负党和人民的鼓励和关怀，永远作个忠于党、忠于人民的战士，为祖国社会主义建设贡献出全部力量。
