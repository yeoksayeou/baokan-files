Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 18th: A competition campaign centered on ensuring the early completion of six key mechanical equipment manufacturing tasks has been enthusiastically launched in various factories and enterprises in Shenyang. On March 17th, over 35,000 advanced individuals and worker representatives from all fronts of industry, capital construction, transportation, agriculture, and other fields in Shenyang held a city-wide industrial and agricultural production leap forward competition mobilization meeting at the Shenyang City Stadium. At the meeting, the representatives unanimously stated that in realizing this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industry and agriculture, every worker must guarantee the completion of the manufacturing tasks for six types of mechanical products urgently needed by the country: rolling mills, mining equipment, coal washing and coking equipment, power station equipment, locomotives and rolling stock, and irrigation and drainage machinery.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo attended the meeting and delivered a speech. In his speech, Bo Yibo pointed out that the four major targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are more ambitious leap forward targets than those of 1958. Achieving these targets will allow our country to take another big step forward on the road of socialist construction.

In order to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, Bo Yibo put forward the following issues that need attention: First, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, boost morale, and do everything possible to increase production and practice economy, and tap production potential; second, it is necessary to rapidly launch a mass movement for high yield and high quality centered on vigorous technical revolution; third, it is necessary to grasp the production progress and organizational measures on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis; fourth, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of "the whole country as one chessboard," concentrate forces, ensure key points, strengthen collaboration, and support each other. He pointed out that in the next few months, it is particularly important to concentrate forces and give priority to ensuring the completion of key products such as steel, coal, coal washing and coking equipment, power station equipment, locomotives and rolling stock, and irrigation and drainage machinery when allocating materials, equipment, electricity, and transportation capacity. He said, "The second quarter is the most valuable time for national industrial and agricultural production. 'Opportunity knocks but once,' we must immediately take action, launch a vigorous production upsurge, forge ahead bravely, and fulfill and overfulfill the glorious tasks assigned to you by the state."

After the start of the competition, Liu Dengyun, deputy director of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, on behalf of all the factory's workers, proposed at the meeting: We must manufacture a cold rolling mill with an annual output of 100,000 tons of silicon steel sheets by the end of March this year, and manufacture 40 pieces of equipment for a blooming mill with an annual output of 800,000 tons of steel billets. The two sets of blooming mills with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel billets each, which are currently under construction, will also be completed in April and June, respectively. While completing the rolling mill equipment, all the factory's workers will also collaborate with fraternal factories to manufacture large castings and forgings, and make preparations for manufacturing two large section steel rolling mills with an annual output of one million tons each in the second half of the year.

The representative of Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, which is carrying out a competition to complete the 80 coal washing machines assigned by the state ahead of schedule and emergency production tasks, put forward leap forward targets at the meeting today. They guaranteed to complete the production task of this batch of coal washing machines one month to forty days ahead of schedule, complete the newly accepted three sets of 650 mm rolling mill tasks before the end of July, and strive to complete the production tasks of mining, power station, and irrigation and drainage equipment ahead of schedule, ensuring the overfulfillment of the production plans for March and the first quarter. The specific measures they proposed are to concentrate manpower and material resources according to national needs and the key points of production in various periods, vigorously carry out mass movements, and deeply develop the technical revolution.

The representatives of the Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant, Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang Fan Factory, Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, and Liming Machinery Plant, seven factories which jointly undertake the manufacturing task of sixty 1,500 kW power generation equipment, also guaranteed at the meeting that they would complete this batch of production tasks before August.

Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, spoke at the end of the competition rally. He pointed out that Liaoning Province bears a major responsibility in the national completion of the four major targets, and the success or failure of Liaoning Province's completion is related to the completion of the national plan. Huang Huoqing called on the workers to bravely shoulder this burden. Make every screw's production potential play out, make every inch of steel play a greater role, and save every kilowatt-hour of electricity, every kilogram of gasoline, and every kilogram of coal that should be saved, and in terms of time, every second must be fought for. Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, finally called on all the workers in Shenyang to do everything possible to overcome difficulties and ensure the completion of the manufacturing tasks for the six major types of mechanical equipment.

    干劲越鼓越足　潜力越挖越大
    沈阳市职工代表集会比武　决心提前完成六大设备
    据新华社沈阳18日电　一个以保证提前完成六项重点机械设备制造任务为中心的竞赛运动，已经在沈阳市各个工厂企业中热烈展开。3月17日，来自全市工业、基本建设、交通运输、农业等各个战线的三万五千多名先进人物和职工代表，在沈阳市体育场举行了全市工农业生产跃进比武动员大会。会上，代表们一致表示：在实现今年工农业更大更好更全面的大跃进中，每一个职工一定以更大的干劲，保证完成国家急需的轧钢机、矿山设备、洗煤炼焦设备、电站设备、机车车辆和排灌机械六类机械产品的制造任务。
    国务院副总理薄一波出席了这个大会，并且在会上讲了话。薄一波在讲话中指出，党的八届六中全会提出的1959年的钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标，是一个比1958年更宏伟的跃进指标。实现这个指标，我国就可以在社会主义建设的道路上又向前迈进一大步。
    为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，薄一波提出以下几个需要注意的问题：第一，要充分发动群众，鼓足干劲，千方百计地增产节约，挖掘生产潜力；第二，要迅速开展大闹技术革命为中心的高产优质的群众运动；第三，要按月、按旬、按日地抓生产进度，抓组织措施；第四，要认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，集中力量，保证重点，加强协作，互相支援。他指出，在最近几个月内，特别要集中使用力量，在分配材料、设备、电力和运输力量的时候，首先保证钢铁、煤炭、洗煤炼焦设备、电站设备、机车车辆和排灌机械等重点产品完成计划。他说，“第二季度是全国工农业生产最宝贵的时候，‘机不可失，时不再来’，我们必须立即行动起来，掀起一个热火朝天的生产高潮，奋勇前进，完成和超额完成国家给你们的光荣任务。”
    比武竞赛开始后，沈阳重型机器厂副厂长刘登云代表全厂职工在大会上提出：一定在今年3月末制造出一台年产十万吨矽钢片的冷轧机，制造出一套年产八十万吨钢坯的初轧机的四十项设备，正在制造中的两套年产各六十万吨钢坯的初轧机，也分别在4月、6月完成。在完成轧钢设备的同时，全厂职工还要为兄弟厂协作制造大型铸锻件，并且为下半年制造两套各年产一百万吨的大型型钢轧机作好准备工作。
    正在为提前完成国家交给的八十台洗煤和紧急生产任务开展竞赛的沈阳矿山机器厂的代表，今天在大会上提出了跃进指标。他们保证提前一个月到四十天全部完成这批洗煤机的生产任务，在7月底以前全部完成新接受的三套六百五十公厘轧钢机任务，并且力争提前完成采矿、电站、排灌设备的生产任务，保证3月份和一季度生产计划的超额完成。他们提出的具体措施是，根据国家需要和各个时期生产的重点，集中使用人力物力，大搞群众运动，深入开展技术革命。
    全市共同担负六十台一千五百瓩发电设备制造任务的东北机器制造厂、沈阳机床一厂、沈阳机床二厂、沈阳机床三厂、沈阳扇风机厂、沈阳矿山机器厂和黎明机械厂等七个工厂的代表，也在会上保证，要在8月以前完成这批生产任务。
    中共辽宁省委第一书记黄火青在比武竞赛大会结束时讲了话。他指出，辽宁省在全国完成四大指标中担负着重大任务，辽宁省完成的好坏，关系着全国计划的完成。黄火青号召职工们，要勇敢地担负起这个担子。使每一个螺钉的生产潜力都发挥出来，使每一寸钢材都发挥更大作用，把应该节省的每一度电、每一斤汽油、每一斤煤都要节省下来，在时间上，要分秒必争。中共沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚在大会最后号召沈阳全市职工，千方百计，克服困难，保证六大类机械设备制造任务的完成。
