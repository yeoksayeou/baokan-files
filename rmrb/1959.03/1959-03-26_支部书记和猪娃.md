    The Branch Secretary and Piglets
    In the middle of the night, a strong wind suddenly sprang up outside, and the cold air drilled straight into the house.紀永傳, the Party Branch Secretary of the Yuntai Commune Livestock Farm, who had just returned from inspecting the pigsty, had just closed his eyes when he was awakened. He remembered that there was still a sow in the pigsty about to give birth, and he couldn't sleep anymore.
      "With such cold weather, there will be problems when the sow gives birth!"紀永傳 muttered to himself as he sat up. Looking out the window, the wind was getting stronger and stronger. "Go check on the sow!" He put on his coat, rubbed his sleepy eyes, and walked out of the house.
    He groped his way to the pigsty in the dark and lit the small glass lamp. In the dim light, he saw the sow lying there groaning, probably about to give birth to piglets.
    He busily carried wheat straw and made the pig nest thick and warm. Then he moved a firewood door to block the entrance of the pen, so there wasn't any wind inside. He sat next to the sow, smoking, waiting for the piglets to be born.
    The cold wind blew harder and harder, and the pigsty became colder and colder. The sow was shivering from the cold and kept squealing. "You're cold, aren't you!" he said, taking off his coat and putting it on the sow. The sow stopped shivering, nuzzled the grass with its mouth, and lay down quietly.
    The night grew deeper, and the cold air pierced his bones like a sharp knife. But he still vigilantly kept watch. After a long while, the sow began to give birth. The branch secretary rolled up his sleeves and stared intently at the sow. As soon as a piglet was born, he held it gently to the side as if he had found a treasure, afraid that the sow would crush it. The piglets were afraid of the cold and kept squealing. The branch secretary became anxious and quickly unbuttoned his clothes, putting the piglets into his arms one by one.
    The sow finished giving birth, and the sky was beginning to brighten. Only then did the branch secretary breathe a sigh of relief. He took the piglets out of his arms and placed them next to the sow.纪永传's eyes were red from staying up, and as he looked at the group of plump piglets, a suppressed joy spread across his face, and he said happily, "The commune has added another asset!"

    支部书记和猪娃
    半夜，外面忽然刮起了大风，寒气直往屋里钻。从外面巡视猪舍回来的云台公社畜牧场党支部书记纪永传，刚刚合上眼，就被惊醒了。他想起猪舍里还有一只要生产的母猪，再也睡不着了。
      “天这么冷，猪生娃子会出问题的！”纪永传一边自言自语，一边就坐了起来。望望窗外，风越刮越大。“看看母猪去！”他披上大衣，揉了揉瞌睡的眼，走出屋子。
    他摸着黑来到猪舍，点亮了小玻璃灯。在昏暗的灯光下，看到母猪躺在那里直哼哼，大概快要生小猪了。
    他忙着抱麦秸，把猪窝铺得又厚又暖和。以后又搬来了柴扉，把圈门挡了起来。里面一点风也没有。他坐在母猪的身边，吸着烟，等待猪娃降生。
    冷风越刮越厉害，猪舍里也越来越冷，母猪冻得颤抖起来，不断地叫着。“冷吧！”他说着就把大衣脱了下来，披在母猪身上。母猪不打颤了，嘴巴拱拱草，安静地躺着。
    夜，更深了，冷气像尖刀似地向他骨头里钻。但他仍精神抖擞地守候着。又过了好一会，母猪开始下崽了。支书卷了卷衣袖，全神贯注地直盯着母猪。猪娃一落地，他像得到宝贝似的，两手轻轻地把它捧在一边，生怕母猪压坏了它。猪娃怕冷，冻得直叫。支书着了急，连忙解开自己的衣服，把猪娃一个个地放进怀里。
    母猪生完了娃子，天色已微明了。支书这才松了口气。把猪娃子从怀里抱了出来，放在母猪的身边。两眼熬得红红的纪永传，望着这群胖胖的猪娃子，脸上泛起了抑止不住的喜悦，高兴地说：“社里又添了一笔财产！”
