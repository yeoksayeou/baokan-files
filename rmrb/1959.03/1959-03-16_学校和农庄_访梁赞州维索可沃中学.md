    Schools and Collective Farms
    ——Visiting the Visokovo Middle School in Ryazan Oblast
    By our reporter Cui Yongchang
    Russian winter is a beautiful season, and the Ryazan Oblast, renowned for its outstanding scenery, has a unique charm in winter. Although it is already early March, the ground is still covered with a thick layer of snow. Houses and trees are half-buried in the snow, and the wide Oka River is frozen solid. Sleighs pulled by horses frequently dash across the river surface.

    After leaving Ryazan City, the car sped northwest along the Moscow-Kuibyshev highway. Half an hour later, we arrived at the Visokovo Ten-Year Middle School in the Rybnovsky District.

    Rural schools in Ryazan Oblast have taken a leading role in connecting with production. In the current educational reform, the schools in this oblast have created many advanced experiences, and school education is closely integrated with agricultural production. If a few years ago, some graduates of rural middle schools all wanted to go to big cities to apply to universities, breaking away from agricultural production, now this situation has undergone a fundamental change. Currently, more than 7,000 middle school graduates are working on collective farms, becoming a crack force in Ryazan Oblast for increasing production. Not long ago, when Comrade Khrushchev came to Ryazan to present awards, he said at a mass rally: "The rural youth of Ryazan Oblast have set a very good example. Thousands of middle school graduates have come to work on collective farms and livestock farms... This is a very good thing."

    Every school here seems to be part of a collective farm. In the schoolyard, you can see tractors, sowing machines, trucks, and various other production tools. Senior students can drive tractors and cars, and girls can sow seeds and milk cows. When we arrived at Visokovo Middle School, we saw a garage for storing tractors next to the school building, and behind the school building, we saw large areas of teaching experimental fields.

    School Principal Denisov told us that their school was converted into a ten-year middle school in 1954. Now there are 287 students, all of whom are children of agricultural workers from nearby collective farms and state farms. Even before the promulgation of the decree on educational reform, the teachers of this school raised the issue of connecting with production and often organized students to work on collective farms, but this was somewhat temporary. After the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Ryazan Oblast began to strengthen labor education for students. At that time, many schools began to engage in teaching experimental fields and organize students to engage in production. After the promulgation of the educational reform decree, labor production became one of the regular courses, and a preliminary teaching syllabus for labor education was formulated.

    We asked Comrade Denisov how their school's labor education was specifically organized. He replied that labor education is divided into several aspects: If divided by the nature of the work, there are two major categories: field production and animal husbandry production. In terms of field production, last year they cultivated a total of 26 hectares of teaching experimental fields, planting several crops such as corn, wheat, and potatoes. All the work from sowing to harvesting was done by the students themselves. In terms of animal husbandry production, it includes two projects: raising cattle and raising rabbits. Now the school has a cowshed and a rabbit farm. If divided by grade level, the main focus for lower grades is to cultivate labor viewpoints. Children in grades one to five plant crops on campus and take care of rabbits in the rabbit farm, learning to feed grass and add feed, etc. For higher grades, they are taught specialized techniques, such as driving tractors, driving cars, sowing, fertilizing, hoeing, and other techniques, so that they can directly go to work on collective farms after graduation.

    Kvonovnikov, the Minister of Propaganda of the Ryazan Oblast Party Committee, also told us that last year, the 121 ten-year middle schools in Ryazan Oblast cultivated a total of 3,700 hectares of experimental fields. In addition, many primary schools planted 2,000 hectares of corn. On this nearly 6,000 hectares of land, not only was the students' labor ability exercised, but also tens of thousands of tons of grain and feed were produced.

    We asked Comrade Denisov how the labor was organized last year and what the results were. He said that the two most important stages of field work are sowing and harvesting. During these two work periods, all the students go to the fields. Senior students drive tractors, and junior students do some simple labor. During the crop growing season, students above the fifth grade are divided into four work teams to take care of the crops in stages and keep a diary of the crop growth under the leadership of the biology teacher. There is also a biology enthusiasts group in the senior grade that conducts various experiments in the field. Last year, the crops they planted generally had a bumper harvest. Each hectare of cornfield yielded 500 quintals of silage, which was one-fifth higher than the yield of the collective farm. This is certainly a very good harvest, but there is an even more important harvest: most of the graduates in 1958 went to work on collective farms, and many of them have now become production experts in the collective farms. For example, the calf feeder Kodyakina and the tractor driver Fedoseyev in the "Russia" Collective Farm. The "Russia" Collective Farm is very satisfied with the graduates of this school because they not only work well but also take the lead in learning and studying technology. These young people are all active members striving to become members of the Communist Labor Team.

    If the "Russia" Collective Farm was still a little worried about the school running experimental fields a few years ago, now these doubts have been completely eliminated. Last year, the experimental field was 26 hectares, and this year the collective farm decided to increase it by another 14 hectares and help them solve problems such as seeds and fertilizers.

    Comrade Denisov took us to visit the school's rabbit farm and cowshed. In the rabbit farm, we saw forty or fifty well-fed rabbits. The "director" of the rabbit farm, seventh-grade student Levicheva, said that each rabbit's cage was made by themselves. They have a special work team, and each member is responsible for the breeding work of a rabbit. Biology teacher Balankin told reporters that when these rabbits give birth to rabbits in the fall, they will be sold to the state purchasing station. Here we also saw two fourth-grade little girls, one named Chernikova and the other named Batlinova. They like this work very much. The biology teacher also taught them how to prepare feed for the rabbits, and now the rabbits they raise are all growing very fat and strong.

    Not far from the school, we also saw the experimental teaching cowshed, which was also handed over to the school by the "Russia" Collective Farm. There are a total of forty calves in the cowshed, and the students are cleaning inside, and some are adding feed to the livestock. All the work is the same as that of the collective farm's cowshed, and a collective farm feeder guides the students to work. Ninth-grade student Kavrilina told us that although the weather is very cold now, each calf can still gain five or six hundred grams per day and night. In summer, the calves can gain seven or eight hundred grams per day and night. We asked her if she liked this job. She said that her mother is a feeder and a production expert in the collective farm and has won medals. Now she is preparing to learn from her mother and will help her work together after graduation.

    At the end of the visit, Principal Denisov said to us: "In more than a month, the spring plowing will begin. We must make the first year of the Seventh Five-Year Plan a year of greater harvest for us. We must not only produce more grain but also train more and better students for the country. This is also our small contribution to the construction of communism." (Picture attached)

    学校和农庄
    ——访梁赞州维索可沃中学
    本报记者　崔永昌
    俄罗斯的冬天是个美丽的季节，向来以风景优秀出名的梁赞州在冬天别有一番风味。虽然已经是3月初了，但是地面上仍然铺着一层厚厚的积雪，房屋、树木都有一半埋在雪中，宽广的奥加河也冻得一动不动，河面上时时有马拉的雪橇飞驰而过。
    汽车开出梁赞市以后，沿着莫斯科——古比雪夫公路向着西北方急驰，半小时以后，我们来到了雷布诺夫斯基区的维索可沃十年制中学。
    梁赞州农村的学校在联系生产上起了带头作用，在目前教育改革中，这个州的学校创造了许多先进经验，学校的教育和农业生产密切地配合了起来。如果几年前农村中学的一些毕业生全想到大城市去投考大学，脱离农业生产，那么现在这一情况已经起了根本变化。目前有七千多名中学毕业生在农庄中劳动，他们成了梁赞州提高生产的一支尖兵。不久前当赫鲁晓夫同志来到梁赞授奖时，他在群众大会上说：“梁赞州的农村青年作出了很好的榜样，数千中学毕业生来到农庄和畜牧场工作……这是一件很好的事情。”
    这里的每个学校全好像是农庄的一部分，在学校的院子里你可以看见拖拉机、播种机、载重汽车和其他各种各样生产工具，高年级的学生又会开拖拉机，又会开汽车，女孩子又会播种，又会挤牛奶。当我们来到维索可沃中学时，在校舍旁边看到了保存拖拉机的车库，在校舍后面我们看到了大片的教学试验田。
    学校校长捷尼索夫向我们说，他们的学校是从1954年改成十年制中学的，现在有二百八十七名学生，他们全是附近集体农庄和国营农场农业工作者的子弟。还在教育改革的法令公布以前，这个学校的教员们就提出了联系生产的问题，并且也经常组织学生到集体农庄去劳动，但是这毕竟是有些临时性质的。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，在梁赞州开始加强了对学生的劳动教育，当时许多学校就开始搞教学试验田，组织学生进行生产。教育改革法令公布以后，劳动生产成了正课之一，并且初步制定了劳动教育的教学大纲。
    我们问捷尼索夫同志，他们学校的劳动教育是怎样具体组织的。他回答说，劳动教育分成几个方面：如果按工作性质分有田间生产和畜牧业生产两大类。在田间生产方面，去年他们一共种了二十六公顷教学试验田，种了玉米、小麦、土豆等几种作物，从播种到收获一切工作都是学生们自己干的；在畜牧业生产方面，包括养牛和养兔两项工作，现在学校有一个牛棚和一个养兔房。如果按年级分，那么对低年级的学生主要是培养劳动观点，一至五年级的孩子在校园里种植农作物，在养兔房里看护家兔，学习喂草添料等等，而对于高年级的学生则要教给他们专门技术，如开拖拉机，开汽车，播种，施肥，锄草等等技术，使得他们毕业以后能够直接到农庄工作。
    梁赞州党委宣传部部长阔诺夫尼可夫还告诉我们说，去年梁赞州的一百二十一座十年制中学一共耕种了三千七百公顷试验田，另外还有许多小学种植了二千公顷的玉米，在这将近六千公顷的土地上不但锻炼了学生的劳动能力，并且生产出了十几万吨粮食和饲料。
    我们问捷尼索夫同志，去年劳动是怎样组织的，成绩如何？他说，田间工作最主要的两个阶段是播种和收割，在这两个工作期间，全体学生都到地里边去，高年级的学生开拖拉机，低年级的学生做些简易的劳动。在粮食生长期间，五年级以上的学生分成四个工作队分期看护庄稼，并且在生物教员的领导下作庄稼生长情况日记。高年级还有一个生物学爱好者小组在地里进行各种试验。去年他们种的庄稼普遍丰收，每公顷玉米地收下了五百公担青贮饲料，比农庄的产量还高五分之一。这当然是一项很好的收获，但是还有一项更重要的收获是1958年大部分毕业生都到农庄去工作了，并且有许多现在已经成了农庄中的生产能手。例如现在“俄罗斯”集体农庄中的牛犊饲养员阔佳金娜，拖拉机手费多谢也夫就是。“俄罗斯”集体农庄对这个学校的毕业生非常满意，因为他们不但工作好，并且还带头学习，钻研技术，这些年青人全是争取当共产主义劳动队队员的积极分子。
    如果说几年前，“俄罗斯”集体农庄对于学校搞试验田还有些不放心的话，现在这些怀疑已经完全消除了，去年试验田搞了二十六公顷，今年农庄决定再增加十四公顷，并且帮助他们解决种子、肥料等等问题。
    捷尼索夫同志带我们参观了学校的养兔房和牛棚，在养兔房里我们看到了四五十头喂得肥肥的家兔，养兔房的“主任”，七年级的学生列维切娃说，每个兔子的铁笼都是他们自己做的，他们有一个专门工作队，每个队员专门负责一个家兔的饲养工作。生物教员巴兰金告诉记者说，到秋天时这些家兔生了小兔以后将卖给国家收购站。这里我们还看到了四年级的两个小女孩，一个叫车尔尼可娃，一个叫巴特林诺娃。她们非常喜欢这个工作，生物老师还教给了她们给兔子准备饲料的方法，现在她们饲养的兔子全长得很肥很壮。
    离学校不远，我们还看到了实验教学的牛棚，这也是“俄罗斯”集体农庄交给学校经营的，牛棚里面一共有四十几头小牛，学生们正在里面打扫，还有的人在给牲口添饲料。一切工作全和集体农庄的牛棚一样，并且有一位农庄的饲养员指导学生们劳动。九年级的学生卡甫利林娜告诉我们说，现在天气虽然很冷，但是每头小牛每昼夜仍可以上膘五、六百克，在夏天小牛每昼夜可以加重七八百克。我们问她喜欢不喜欢这个工作，她说她母亲就是一个饲养员，并且是农庄中的生产能手，曾经得过奖章，现在她准备向她母亲学习，并且在毕业后要帮助母亲去一同工作。
    在结束访问的时候，校长捷尼索夫对我们说：“再过一个多月就要开始春耕了，我们要使七年计划的第一年成为我们更大丰收的一年，不但要多打粮食，并且要为国家培养出更多更好的学生，这也是我们对于共产主义建设的一点贡献。”（附图片）
