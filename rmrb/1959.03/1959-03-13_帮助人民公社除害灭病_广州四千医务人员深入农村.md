Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th: Four thousand medical personnel from Guangzhou have formed work teams and gone deep into the people's communes to carry out health campaigns centered on eliminating pests and diseases.

In the past two months, these medical personnel have trained a large number of health workers, childcare workers, and cooks for six special districts including Foshan and Shantou. They have also gone deep into farmers' homes to conduct health education, provide mobile medical treatment, and deliver medicine to farmers' doors. The work team assigned to the Panyu People's Commune assisted production teams in establishing medical rooms. They also worked with local medical personnel to go deep into nurseries, kindergartens, and canteens, taking various preventive measures and injecting placental globulin into many children to prevent measles. The work teams extensively conducted surveys of endemic diseases. The work teams also worked with farmers to build toilets, move manure tanks, dredge ditches, fill in depressions, and clean pig and cattle pens.

Medical personnel also went to the communes' canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly to work alongside cooks and childcare workers, helping canteens and nurseries establish regular hygiene and cleaning systems.

Work teams in various locations have trained a large number of grassroots health cadres, cooks, health workers, and childcare workers for the communes. According to statistics from the Jiangmen and Zhanjiang brigades of Zhongshan Medical College and ten detachments directly under the Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau, a total of more than 18,000 health workers, more than 38,000 childcare workers, and more than 17,000 cooks have been trained.
