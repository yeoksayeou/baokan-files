Xinhua News Agency, March 29th. Taipei Dispatch: After the news of the Tibetan traitors launching an armed rebellion in Lhasa reached Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which had long been in collusion with the Tibetan rebels, hurriedly expressed their "active support," and directly admitted to having "close ties" with the Tibetan rebel leaders and having "constantly provided assistance and support for many years."

    On March 26th, Chiang Kai-shek, in his so-called "Letter to Tibetan Compatriots," encouraged the Tibetan traitors, saying that they "are not isolated." He clamored to "concentrate all forces" to give the Tibetan rebels "continued and effective assistance."

    Chen Cheng, the "Vice President" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly confessed at a press conference held in Taipei on the same day that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had colluded with the Tibetan rebels long ago. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had established "close ties with Tibetan leaders in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, and Tibet" as early as 1957, and had "constantly launched anti-communist armed struggles." He also said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had "constantly provided assistance and support to the Tibetan rebels for many years. However, due to spatial distance, the amount of past assistance was difficult to adapt to actual needs." He expressed that he would "make the greatest efforts to overcome various difficulties and provide massive support" in the future. However, he also revealed that he had no confidence in the Tibetan rebellion, and he wanted everyone to "not only pay attention to the gains and losses of Lhasa alone."

    卖国贼叛乱分子狼狈为奸
    蒋介石集团与西藏叛乱分子早有勾结
    新华社29日讯　台北消息：西藏叛国分子在拉萨发动武装叛乱的消息传到台湾后，和西藏叛乱分子早有勾结的蒋介石集团赶忙表示“积极支持”，并直认和西藏叛乱魁首早有“密切联系”，“多年来曾不断予以协助支援”。
    3月26日，蒋介石在所谓“告西藏同胞书”中鼓励西藏叛国分子说，他们“不是孤立的”。他叫喊要“集中一切力量”来给西藏叛乱分子以“继续有效的援助”。
    蒋介石集团的“副总统”陈诚同日在台北举行的记者招待会上，公开供认蒋介石集团和西藏叛乱分子早有勾结。他说，蒋介石集团早在1957年就和“甘、青、川、康、藏等地的藏族领袖取得密切联系”，并且“不断发动反共武装斗争”。他还说，蒋介石集团对西藏叛乱分子“多年来曾不断地予以协助支援。但因空间距离关系，过去的援助量难以适应实际需要”，他表示今后要“尽最大努力克服各种困难，予以大量支援”。但是他也透露对西藏的叛乱没有什么信心，他要大家“不能仅仅注意于拉萨一城的得失”。
