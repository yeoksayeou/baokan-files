Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 16th (TASS): On March 16th, Soviet Minister of Council Chairman Khrushchev held a reception in the Kremlin for the Iraqi Government Delegation. Khrushchev delivered a speech at the reception, the full text of which is as follows:

Respected Minister Ibrahim Kubba! Distinguished Guests from the Republic of Iraq! Gentlemen! Comrades!

It is with great pleasure that we welcome here the envoys of the heroic Iraqi people, who, under the leadership of their national leader, Abdul Karim Kassem, achieved a victorious revolution in July 1958. The revolution in Iraq and its further development have brought significant results to the Iraqi people. They have thrown off the chains of foreign colonialism and feel freer in their own country.

You must know that a revolution means more than just replacing the personnel of this or that government. If only the people sitting in government positions are replaced, while maintaining the past policies that violate the interests of the people, then the people will soon understand that this is not a revolution, but merely the replacement of some people by others. In that case, the people will certainly not stop fighting against policies that violate their interests.

A true revolution will surely shake up the outdated old system, destroy these systems, and enable the people to express their initiative, enjoy the material and spiritual wealth created by their labor, and make the country serve the interests of the people. A government that implements policies that benefit the people can always count on the support of the people.

In recent days, when a conspiracy group attempted to overthrow the government led by Abdul Karim Kassem, the Iraqi people supported their government. The conspirators were annihilated, and the despicable conspiracy of the reactionary forces completely went bankrupt because of the people's determination to defend their national independence.

The revolution in Iraq is supported by all progressive forces because it has made a significant contribution to the firm struggle of the Arab peoples against imperialist colonialists. The revolution in Iraq also won deep sympathy and praise in the United Arab Republic. I still remember the situation in the first few days after the success of this revolution. At that time, President of the United Arab Republic, Gamal Nasser, expressed his willingness to meet with me and exchange views. Later, we held such a meeting in Moscow.

I had a detailed conversation with the President and shared his joy in the victory of the Iraqi revolution, because this revolution dealt an extremely heavy blow to the plans of the imperialist colonialists. However, Mr. Nasser's attitude towards the Iraqi revolution gradually began to change. We do not fully understand why this happened. The measures implemented by the Government of the Republic of Iraq have clearly brought hope to the people in the past and present; this government truly listens to the voices of its own people and can do everything possible for the people under the current conditions of national economic development.

In this case, what is the reason for President Nasser's change of attitude? It seems that this shows his confusion on the issue of the union of the Republic of Iraq with the United Arab Republic. President Nasser insisted that the Republic of Iraq be merged into the United Arab Republic.

Obviously, the issue of national unification should be resolved by the people of the countries concerned. It is up to them to decide whether to unite or maintain independent development, whether to organize federations or confederations. The Soviet Union has never interfered in such matters in the past or present. However, we are not indifferent to the situation in areas not far from our borders, and we can express our attitude towards events that occur there.

In order to victoriously carry out the struggle to break free from colonial oppression and consolidate the victorious achievements of the people who have broken free from this oppression, and in order to achieve economic independence, the people of these countries must unite their efforts. However, this does not mean that countries that have broken free from the shackles of colonialism must join some kind of union, submit to a government, or follow a leader or a chief.

The unification of several countries into one country is a complex issue. Historical experience has shown that the people of all countries, especially those who have recently broken free from foreign subordination, always do their best to maintain their sovereignty and are very sensitive to any attempts to undermine this sovereignty. Only when the necessary political and economic conditions for unification are ripe, only when all the characteristics of the countries implementing unification are taken into account, can national unification bring benefits to the people. A union imposed on the people against their will cannot be consolidated. In solving these problems, wisdom and patience must be shown. If you act hastily, it may cause results that were not originally expected.

The end result of premature unification will not be the strengthening of people's unity, but only the destruction of this unity. The people of one country participating in the unification will increasingly keenly feel the loss of their national independence, and their former leaders will either retreat to a secondary position because they do not agree with the opinions of the leaders of the unified country in all aspects, or they will be completely thrown aside. What happens is not the strengthening of unity, but the division of forces. Who benefits from this? This only benefits the enemies of people's freedom, only benefits the imperialists.

We sincerely regret that after the victory of the Iraqi revolution and the successful development of this revolution, a relationship has been formed between the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic that cannot promote the unity of the forces of the Arab people to fight for their national independence, for the economic development of their countries, and for the further improvement of the people's living standards. This relationship is of no benefit to the Arab people, but only benefits the colonial countries that hope to weaken the Arab countries.

We express our regret about this especially because our people have always had sincere and friendly feelings towards both the people of the Republic of Iraq and the people of the United Arab Republic. When the colonialists attempted to seize the Suez Canal, the Soviet people sympathized deeply with the heroic struggle of the Egyptians and closely concerned themselves with the fate of the Egyptian people. Our country took various measures to stop the colonialists' predatory war against Egypt and help Egypt maintain its independence.

The heroic Egyptian people, under the leadership of the government headed by Gamal Abdul Nasser, showed strong and heroic spirit in the struggle against the aggressors and defended their country. We have pointed out more than once the positive role of President Nasser in this struggle.

Everyone also knows that the Soviet people have helped Syria eliminate the serious threat it faced due to the imperialist conspiracy against it, and this has also been widely recognized by the Arab people.

The interests of the further development of the Arab countries, their struggle to thoroughly break free from subordination to colonialism and to strengthen their national economies, require strengthening the Arab unity and the unity of the people of the Arab countries to fight against the conspiracies of the imperialists. We hope that reason will prevail, and hope to do everything possible to eliminate this conflict, so that this conflict will not be exploited by the imperialists. Internal development issues are a matter for the people of each country.

It must be admitted that we were all concerned about President Nasser's recent speeches in Damascus. In these speeches, when he talked about communism and communists, he armed himself with the language of the imperialists.

Attacking communism is nothing new. Mr. Nasser's words about communism have long been said by reactionaries in various countries. Mr. Nasser has not yet used up everything in the arsenal of the enemies of communism. If he is willing to take this path, then he can draw more things from those arsenals.

The history of the struggle against communism has been more than a hundred years. In our country, the Tsar and his tyrannical officials fought against communism. At that time, when they encountered folk idioms like "baking cakes with the free air" in books and newspapers, they would even discover rebellion from this sentence, and words like this would have to be deleted.

Some people call communists agents of foreign countries. Then please ask: Which country do you consider the Soviet communists to be agents of? Who are we agents of? If communists are agents, then we are the agents of the Soviet working class, the Soviet working people, and we serve them faithfully. Communists everywhere are loyal sons of their own people. Saying that communists are agents of other countries is not a new trick. After the February Revolution, when Vladimir Ilyich Lenin returned from abroad, the reactionaries said that he was an agent of Germany. The enemies carried out such vile slanders, even saying that Lenin and then all the Bolsheviks were agents of Germany. But what was the result? The people did not believe this slander. The Bolsheviks were the most faithful representatives of the interests of the workers, working peasants and all working people in our country, and they led the Soviet people to achieve the greatest socialist achievements.

Our country has entered a broad world of free development. We have built the most advanced and powerful country with a highly developed economy and culture. President Nasser has had the opportunity to personally understand our country, see our achievements with his own eyes, and correctly assess the development prospects of the Soviet state. All of this has been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, on the basis of communism.

Many people who once opposed communism have long been abandoned and forgotten by the people. If they are sometimes mentioned, it is only as reactionary figures who brought disaster to their country. So I am convinced that the ignoble role of anti-communist fighter will not bring any honor to President Nasser, although it may bring him the favor of certain groups in imperialist countries for a period of time.

People may ask, what is the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic now? I think this relationship will be the same as in the past. Originally, when we established friendly relations with the United Arab Republic, we knew of President Nasser's anti-communist views. It is true that we once thought that in the process of the national liberation struggle that requires the unity of all anti-imperialist forces, greater patience and more care would be shown for the democratic demands of the people of all countries. Regrettably, it is now the opposite. Not only are suppressive measures being taken against the freedom-loving demands of the United Arab Republic, but also against those of other countries. We want to say in a friendly way that if this policy is stubbornly implemented, then this policy is bound to fail.

It is said that Arab nationalism seems to be higher than the interests of individual Arab countries, and higher than the interests of all strata of residents in Arab countries. There is no doubt that the interests of most Arabs are consistent in the struggle against the shackles of colonialism. However, after a country has freed itself from foreign rule, the interests of the people cannot be ignored. Because the interests of all Arabs cannot be completely consistent. Therefore, attempts to ignore the interests of all strata of residents and the interests of the working people under the banner of nationalism are untenable.

Of course, what is happening in the Republic of Iraq is not socialism at all. And we have never established our relationship with Arab countries based on this characteristic. However, we believe that progressive transformations are being realized in the Republic of Iraq, and a more advanced system is being established than in some neighboring countries in the Arab East. Naturally, our sympathy is with those governments and countries that consider the interests of their own people.

We express our warm congratulations to Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kassem for bravely leading the country along the path of progress and strengthening the young Republic of Iraq, and we wish him and the government he leads new achievements.

We pay close attention to and sincerely sympathize with the activities of the Iraqi government aimed at improving its national economy and the welfare of its people. We hope that the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Iraq today will help achieve these goals. The agreement stipulates that we will provide technical assistance to Iraq in the construction of metallurgical plants, machine-building factories, chemical plants, light and food industry enterprises, water conservancy projects, and other projects. We want to help the Iraqi people eliminate the serious consequences of colonialism as soon as possible in a brotherly manner. Our economic and technical assistance to Iraq is friendly and selfless; this assistance is not attached to any political, military or other conditions.

We have given such assistance to Egypt and Syria, and now we are assisting the United Arab Republic. We are also giving such assistance to other countries. We have fulfilled our obligations in the past, and we will faithfully fulfill these obligations in the future.

In the future, we are also prepared to expand economic ties and do our best to help the Iraqi people, the Iraqi state, and other countries that have broken free from colonialism.

The Iraqi government's plan to build industrial enterprises, water conservancy projects, railways, and other important economic projects is a major step on the road to eliminating the backwardness of the national economy. All of this also means employing tens of thousands of workers and guaranteeing to provide cheaper goods and food for their own people.

Your government, and the Iraqi people, face a difficult and lofty task, as you have told us, to transform your homeland from a backward colonial country into an advanced country in the Middle East and Near East. You have all the necessary conditions to do this. The outstanding and industrious Iraqi people have made great contributions to the treasure trove of world culture and civilization.

The history of Iraq is rich in the glorious tradition of fighting for national independence. Your country has various rich natural resources. You have loyal and selfless friends who are willing to help you overcome difficulties. And we have no doubt that the freedom-loving Iraqi people will overcome all obstacles and will surely realize the great tasks facing the Republic of Iraq.

Please allow me to propose a toast to the consolidation of friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Iraq!

To Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kassem and the members of his government!

To our distinguished guests!

To world peace!

    赫鲁晓夫在招待伊政府代表团时讲话
    热烈支持伊拉克捍卫民族独立
    指出纳赛尔反对伊拉克和反共只有利于帝国主义希望理智将占上风，消除伊阿冲突，不被帝国主义利用
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社莫斯科16日电：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫3月16日在克里姆林宫举行招待会，招待伊拉克政府代表团。赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话，全文如下：尊敬的易卜拉欣·库巴部长先生！各位伊拉克共和国的贵宾！各位先生！各位同志！
    我们怀着非常满意的心情在这里欢迎英勇的伊拉克人民的使者，伊拉克人民1958年7月在自己的民族领袖阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆的领导下实现了胜利的革命。伊拉克的革命和革命的进一步发展，给伊拉克人民带来了显著的成果，人民抛掉了外国殖民主义者的锁链，感觉到在自己的祖国生活更加自由了。
    要知道，革命不仅仅意味着更换这一任或那一任政府的人员。如果只更换坐在政府席上的人然而却保持过去违反人民利益的政策，那末人民很快就会理解到，这不是革命，而只是由一些人来代替另外一些人而已。这样一来，人民当然不会停止同违反他们利益的政策作斗争。
    真正的革命一定会动摇过了时的旧制度，破坏这些制度，使人民有可能表现自己的主动精神，能够享受自己的劳动所创造的物质和精神财富，使国家为人民的利益服务。执行有利于人民政策的政府，始终是可以指望得到人民的支持的。
    近几天来当阴谋集团企图推翻由阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆领导的政府的时候，伊拉克人民支持了自己的政府。阴谋者被歼灭了，由于人民决心捍卫自己的民族独立，反动势力的卑鄙阴谋完全破产了。
    伊拉克的革命所以获得一切进步力量的支持，是因为它对阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义殖民主义者的坚决斗争作出了重大贡献。伊拉克的革命在阿拉伯联合共和国也曾经博得深切的同情和赞许。我还记得这次革命成功的最初几天的情况。当时，阿拉伯联合共和国总统加麦尔·纳赛尔表示愿意同我会晤并交换意见。后来我们在莫斯科举行了这样的会晤。
    我同总统作了详细的交谈，同他一道为伊拉克革命的胜利感到高兴，因为这次革命给了帝国主义殖民主义者的计划以极其沉重的打击。但是，纳赛尔先生对伊拉克革命的态度渐渐开始改变了。我们完全不理解为什么会发生这种情况。伊拉克共和国政府所实行的措施过去和现在明明给人民带来了希望；这个政府真正倾听自己人民的声音，并能为人民做到一切在国家经济目前发展的条件下可能做到的事。
    在这种情况下，纳赛尔总统的态度的改变原因何在呢？看来，这里表现出了他在伊拉克共和国同阿拉伯联合共和国联合这个问题上的迷误。纳赛尔总统坚持要伊拉克共和国合并到阿拉伯联合共和国中去。
    显然，国家联合的问题应当由与此有关的那些国家的人民来解决。由他们自己决定：他们联合起来还是保持独立的发展，他们组织还是不组织联邦、邦联。苏联过去和现在一直没有干涉这种事情。但是，我们对离我们国境不远的地区所发生的局势并不是漠不关心的，我们可以对那里发生的事件表示自己的态度。
    为了胜利地进行摆脱殖民主义压迫的斗争和巩固已摆脱了这种压迫的人民的胜利成果，为了取得经济独立，这些国家的人民必须联合自己的努力。但是，这并不意味着，挣脱了殖民主义枷锁的国家一定得要加入国家的某种联合，服从于一个政府或跟着一个领导人、一个领袖走。
    数个国家联合成一个国家，这是一个复杂的问题。历史经验证明，各国人民，特别是不久前摆脱了对外国的从属地位的国家的人民，总是竭尽全力地维护自己的主权，对破坏这种主权的任何企图都非常敏感。只有当实行联合所必要的政治和经济条件成熟了的时候，只有当实行联合的各国的一切特点都得到重视的时候，国家的联合才能给人民带来好处。强加给人民的、违背他们的意志的联合是不可能巩固的。在解决这些问题时，必须表现出英明和耐心。如果是仓卒从事，就可能造成非原来所期望的结果。
    过早联合的结局不会是人民团结的加强，而只会是这种团结遭到破坏。参加联合的一个国家的人民越来越尖锐地开始感觉到本国独立的丧失，而他们从前的领袖由于不是在一切方面都同意联合国家领导人的意见或者退到次要地位，或者完全被抛到一边。所发生的不是团结的加强，而是力量的分裂。这对谁有利呢？这只对人民自由的敌人有利，只对帝国主义者有利。
    我们感到衷心遗憾的是，在伊拉克革命胜利和这一革命得到胜利发展以后，在伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国之间形成了这样一种关系，这种关系不能促使阿拉伯人民的力量联合起来，去为自己的民族独立、为本国的经济发展、为人民生活水平的进一步提高而斗争。这种关系对阿拉伯人民没有益处，而只对希望阿拉伯国家削弱的殖民主义国家有利。
    我们对此表示遗憾特别是因为，我国人民无论是对伊拉克共和国人民，还是对阿拉伯联合共和国的人民，过去和现在一直怀着真诚友好的感情。当殖民主义者企图侵占苏伊士运河时，苏联人民曾经十分同情地对待埃及人的英勇斗争，密切地关心埃及人民的命运。我国采取了各种措施来制止殖民主义者对埃及的掠夺性战争，帮助埃及维护自己的独立。
    英雄的埃及人民在以加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔为首的政府的领导下，在同侵略者的斗争中表现了坚强英勇的精神，保卫住了自己的国家。我们已经不止一次地指出了纳赛尔总统在这一斗争中的肯定的作用。
    大家也知道，苏联人民曾帮助叙利亚消除由于帝国主义对它的阴谋而面临的严重威胁，这一点也得到阿拉伯人民的广泛承认。
    阿拉伯国家进一步发展的利益，它们进行的彻底摆脱对殖民主义的从属地位、争取加强本国经济的斗争，要求加强阿拉伯的一致和阿拉伯国家人民的团结，来对付帝国主义者的阴谋。我们希望，理智将占上风，希望尽一切力量来消除这种冲突，使这种冲突不为帝国主义者所利用。内部发展的问题是每个国家人民的事。
    应该承认，我们大家都为纳赛尔总统最近在大马士革的演说感到忧虑。在这些演说中，当他谈到共产主义和共产党人时，他用帝国主义者的语言来武装自己。
    对共产主义进行攻击，这并不是新鲜事情。纳赛尔先生关于共产主义的话是各国的反动派早已说过了的。纳赛尔先生还没有用完共产主义敌人武库中的全部东西。如果他愿意走这条路，那他还可以从那些武库中搬用更多的东西。
    同共产主义作斗争的历史已经一百多年了。在我国，沙皇和他的暴吏同共产主义进行过斗争，当时，在书本和报纸上碰到像“用自由热气烤饼”这样的民间用语，他们甚至也会从这句话中发现造反，像这样的话都得删去。
    有人把共产党人叫作外国的代理人。那么请问：你们把苏联共产党人算作哪个国家的代理人呢？我们是谁的代理人呢？如果说共产党人是代理人，那我们就是苏联工人阶级、苏联劳动人民的代理人，而且我们在忠诚地为他们服务。各地的共产党人都是本国人民的忠实儿子。说共产党人是别国的代理人，这并不是新的伎俩。在2月革命以后，当弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁由国外回来的时候，反动派就曾说他是德国的代理人。敌人进行了这样卑劣的诽谤，甚至把列宁、随后又把所有的布尔什维克都说成是德国的代理人。可是结果怎样呢？人民没有相信这种诽谤。布尔什维克是我国工人、劳动农民和全体劳动人民利益的最忠实的代表者，他们领导苏联人民取得了最伟大的社会主义成就。
    我们国家进入了自由发展的广阔天地。我们建成了拥有高度发达的经济和文化的、最先进和强大的国家。纳赛尔总统曾有机会亲自来了解我国，亲眼看到我国的成就，正确地估价苏维埃国家的发展远景。所有这些都是在共产党的领导下，在共产主义的基础上才做到的。
    许多曾经反对过共产主义的人早已被人民摒弃和遗忘了。如果说有时还提到他们，那不过是作为给本国人民带来灾难的反动人物而提出来的。所以我确信，反共斗士这个不体面的角色不会给纳赛尔总统带来任何荣誉，虽然它可能在某段时间内会给他带来帝国主义国家某些集团的好感。
    人们可能会问，苏联如今同阿拉伯联合共和国的关系怎样呢？我想，这种关系将和过去一样。本来，我们在同阿拉伯联合共和国建立友好关系的时候，我们就知道纳赛尔总统的反共观点。不错，我们当时曾经想过，在要求一切反帝国主义力量联合起来的民族解放斗争过程中，对各国人民的民主要求会表现出更大的耐性，更多的关怀。很遗憾，现在却相反，不仅对阿拉伯联合共和国的、而且也对其他国家的爱好自由的要求采取镇压的措施。我们想友好地说，如果顽固地执行这种政策，那这种政策必然要破产的。
    据说，阿拉伯民族主义似乎高于个别阿拉伯国家的利益，高于阿拉伯国家各阶层居民的利益。毫无疑问，在反对殖民主义桎梏的斗争中大多数阿拉伯人的利益是一致的。但是，在一个国家摆脱了外国统治以后，就不能忽视人民的利益了。因为所有阿拉伯人的利益不可能是完全一致的。因此，企图在民族主义的旗帜下忽视各阶层居民的利益、忽视劳动人民的利益的做法是站不住脚的。
    当然，在伊拉克共和国发生的完全不是社会主义。而我们也从来没有根据这种特征来建立自己同阿拉伯国家的关系。不过我们认为，在伊拉克共和国正在实现进步的改造，正在建立比阿拉伯东方一些邻国更为先进的制度。自然，我们的同情是在那些考虑本国人民利益的政府和国家方面的。
    我们对伊拉克总理阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆表示热烈的祝贺，祝贺他勇敢地领导国家沿着进步和加强年轻的伊拉克共和国的道路前进，我们希望他和他领导的政府取得新的成就。
    我们密切注意并真挚地同情伊拉克政府旨在提高本国民族经济和本国人民福利的活动。我们希望，今天签订的苏联和伊拉克关于经济和技术合作的协定有助于达到这些目标。协定规定，由我们在技术上帮助伊拉克建设冶金工厂、机器制造厂、化学工厂、轻工业和食品工业企业、水利工程和其他项目。我们要兄弟般地帮助伊拉克人民尽快地消除殖民主义的严重后果。我们对伊拉克的经济援助和技术援助是友好的和无私的；这种援助不附带任何政治、军事或其他条件。
    我们曾给予埃及、叙利亚以这种援助，现在我们正在援助阿拉伯联合共和国。我们也正给其他国家以这种援助。我们过去履行了所承担的义务，将来我们也要忠实地履行这种义务。
    今后我们也准备扩大经济联系，并尽我们的力量来帮助伊拉克人民、伊拉克国家和已经摆脱了殖民主义的其他国家。
    伊拉克政府计划建设工业企业、水利工程、铁路和其他重要的经济项目，这是在消除国家经济的落后状态的道路上的一个重大步骤。这一切也意味着使成千上万劳动者就业，意味着保证为本国人民提供更便宜的商品和食品。
    贵国政府面前，在伊拉克人民面前，摆着一个困难而崇高的任务，正如你们对我们所说的那样，要把自己的祖国从一个落后的殖民地国家变成中近东的先进国家。你们有一切必要的条件来做到这一点。卓越勤劳的伊拉克人民曾对世界文化和文明的宝库作出了很大的贡献。
    伊拉克的历史富有为争取民族独立而斗争的光荣传统。贵国拥有各种丰富的自然资源。你们有忠实和无私的朋友，他们愿意帮助你们克服困难。而我们毫不怀疑，爱好自由的伊拉克人民一定会克服各种障碍，一定能实现摆在伊拉克共和国面前的伟大任务。
    请允许我提议为苏联和伊拉克两国人民的巩固友谊干杯！
    为阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆总理和他的政府成员干杯！
    为我们的贵宾干杯！
    为世界和平干杯！
