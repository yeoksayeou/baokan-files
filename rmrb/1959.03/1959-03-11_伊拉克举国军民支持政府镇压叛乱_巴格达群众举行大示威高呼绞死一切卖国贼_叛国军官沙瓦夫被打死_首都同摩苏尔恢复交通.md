Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 9th. The Iraqi people held a large-scale demonstration in Baghdad on the 9th, expressing their support for the Iraqi Republic government in punishing traitors and conspirators.

　　The demonstrators included workers, peasants, office workers, students, housewives and people from other walks of life. They gathered in Zobeida Square and then walked along Rashid Street to the Ministry of Defense. The masses held placards and huge portraits of Prime Minister Qassem. As the procession moved forward, many people in work clothes ran out of their houses and joined the ranks. Some soldiers sang songs and joined the demonstration, and the masses cheered them enthusiastically. From noon to evening, the streets near the Ministry of Defense were closed to traffic because they were crowded with demonstrators.

　　The demonstrators gathered in front of the Ministry of Defense, shouting slogans to express their support for the government's measures. Workers and peasants in Arab costumes constantly recited poems and gave speeches. One poem said: "Anyone who breaks into our borders will be lassoed, and all traitors will be hanged!"

　　The demonstrators elected a delegation to meet with Prime Minister Qassem, expressing the people's support for the Republic and him, and demanding decisive and swift measures to crush the rebels.

　　Many demonstrators held ropes in their hands, and dummies were hung on major buildings, showing the traitors that the same fate was awaiting them.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 10th. Many Iraqi people's organizations and mass leaders sent telegrams to Prime Minister Qassem on the 8th, after the Shawwaf conspiracy was revealed, supporting his measures against Iraqi traitors and conspirators.

　　A telegram signed by representatives of the National Front of the Tela region and seven worker and peasant representatives to Prime Minister Qassem stated, "We are the armed masses of Tela, and we support the blessed measures you have taken to combat those who are plotting against our Republic." The telegram also stated, "We will dedicate our lives to the Republic."

　　A telegram issued by the Secretariat of the General Union of Students of the Republic of Iraq in the name of hundreds of student union committees across Iraq stated, "We declare: we unswervingly defend our revolution and the survival of our Republic." The telegram expressed to Prime Minister Qassem "absolute support for your fight against the conspirators and ambitious elements colluding with the imperialists."

　　A telegram issued by the President of the Iraqi Education Workers Union and the Council on behalf of 20,000 male and female teachers in Iraq to Prime Minister Qassem stated, "We support your resolute measures to combat the sinful traitors and conspirators."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 10th. According to a report by Baghdad Radio on the 9th, the retired Colonel Shawwaf, who attempted to launch a rebellion in Mosul against the government of the Republic of Iraq, was killed by soldiers under his command.

　　Colonel Mahdawi, the president of the Supreme Military Court of Iraq, pointed out in a radio address on the 9th, "Shawwaf suffered the same fate as Nuri al-Said, the imperialist dog who was beaten to death by the people in the streets of Baghdad."

　　Baghdad Radio emphasized that the country is now completely peaceful. Normal railway traffic has been restored between Baghdad and Mosul.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 8th. The first congress of the Iraqi League for the Defense of Women's Rights opened here this morning.

This convinces me that the people are invincible; this Republic will stand firm." He also praised the role played by women in consolidating the freedom and peace of this Republic.
