Acting as a "Clever Tailor"

    Some employees of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory are carrying out a "clever tailor" campaign, striving to save raw materials and maximize their utilization rate. This campaign is well-organized and seizes an important link in ensuring a greater leap forward in production and construction.
    Practicing strict economy is a basic principle of the socialist economy and a regular activity of all enterprises. In last year's Great Leap Forward, the production of raw materials experienced unprecedented development. The output of the most important industrial raw materials, such as steel and cotton, doubled. This year, the raw materials industry will have an even greater leap forward. However, because the departments that need raw materials are also advancing by leaps and bounds, the quantity of raw materials is not abundant. This requires all enterprises to continue to practice strict economy in the use of raw materials.
    The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory's methods for saving raw materials include reforming processing techniques, improving product design, rational blanking, and utilizing edge and leftover materials. In general, it is carrying out a major technological revolution in the use of raw materials. Last year, many units accumulated experience and made achievements in this area. As long as we earnestly promote and develop these experiences and mobilize the masses to act as "clever tailors," all enterprises can save a considerable amount of raw materials based on the actual raw material consumption quota of last year. Let's all use our brains and come up with clever ideas to strive to save raw materials for the sake of achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward!

### 当“巧裁缝”

    当“巧裁缝”
    重庆建设机床厂的一些职工正在开展“巧裁缝”活动，努力节约原材料，尽量提高原材料的利用率。这一活动开展得好，它抓住了保证生产建设更大跃进的一个重要环节。
    厉行节约本来是社会主义经济的一项基本原则，是各个企业的一项经常的活动。在去年的大跃进中，原材料生产有空前的发展。钢、棉花等最重要的工业原材料，产量翻了一番。今年原材料工业还将有更大的跃进。但是，由于需用原材料的部门也在大踏步前进，所以原材料的数量并不是十分宽裕。这就要求各个企业继续在原材料使用方面厉行节约。
    重庆建设机床厂节约原材料的办法，是改革加工工艺，改进产品设计，合理下料，利用边余料等。总起来讲，是在原材料使用方面大搞技术革命。去年，许多单位都在这方面积累了经验，做出了成绩。只要认真推广和发展这些经验，发动群众人人当“巧裁缝”，各个企业都能在去年实际原材料消耗定额的基础上，再节约不少原材料。大家都来动脑筋、出巧计，为实现更大更好更全面的跃进而努力节约原材料吧！
