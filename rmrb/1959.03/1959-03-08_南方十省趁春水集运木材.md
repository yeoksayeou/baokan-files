Southern Ten Provinces Seize Spring Flood to Transport Timber

    (By our reporter) The ten southern provinces and regions in our country are seizing the spring flood season to vigorously carry out timber collection and transportation work.

    The timber produced in the ten southern provinces and regions is mainly transported by waterways. After the timber is felled, it is transported by land to small streams and rivers, and then floated from the small streams and rivers to the large rivers. The transportation of small streams and rivers is greatly restricted by seasonality, and it is only convenient for timber floating during the spring flood season. According to statistics, by the end of January this year, the timber felling task of the ten southern provinces and regions such as Anhui and Zhejiang has been completed 74% of the annual plan, of which 50% is stored in the mountains, 13% is transported to small streams, 4.5% is transported to big rivers and roads respectively, and only 2.7% is transported to lumber yards. Therefore, concentrating efforts to complete the task of collecting and transporting timber has become the key to completing the annual production task. Recently, at the timber production conference of the ten southern provinces and regions held by the Ministry of Forestry in Wuhan, it was requested that the ten southern provinces and regions must now focus on collection and transportation work, transport all the timber to be transported by water to the sides of the small rivers, and fully prepare for the spring flood season. It is required that 80% of the timber produced throughout the year be rushed to the banks of major rivers before the end of June, and the rivers that will dry up in autumn should be rushed out as soon as possible, and strive to basically complete the timber production and collection task for this year by the end of September. In the first half of this year, all provinces and regions will focus on land transportation (referring to collecting and transporting timber in the mountains) and small-river floating, driving a comprehensive leap forward in the entire timber production.

    Now all provinces and regions have begun to take action. Anhui is taking advantage of the opportunity of several major floods in the Yangtze River, Huai River and Xin'an River and their tributaries to extensively mobilize the masses to carry out surprise attacks on small river transportation, setting off a high tide in rushing to transport timber. Recently, 50,000 cubic meters of timber have been transported to lumber yards and transferred en route; 250,000 mao bamboo have broken through the small river barrier, and 114,200 cubic meters of timber have been transported to big rivers, and 1.16 million mao bamboo have been transported to big rivers. In this rush, Wuhu Special Zone took the lead. Under the leadership of the local party committee and county party committee, more than 38,000 laborers were mobilized, and in five or six days, 20,000 cubic meters of timber were rushed from small rivers to big rivers. Since February 17, Jingning County, Zhejiang Province, has begun "herding sheep" floating. The forestry department alone pushed 8,300 cubic meters of timber into the river in two days. By February 19, Changhua County had released 1,427 cubic meters of timber, and 1,500 cubic meters had been rafted and were waiting to be transported. The Kaihua County Party Committee held a telephone conference, requiring that the season be seized and 50,000 cubic meters be completed in March, and the annual task be completed in the second quarter.

    While vigorously organizing floating, all localities are also seizing the work of salvaging lost timber. By February 19, Jiande County, Zhejiang Province, had salvaged more than 1,100 cubic meters of timber. The secretary of the county party committee personally took charge, arranging for all localities to transport all the timber in the small streams to the big rivers while salvaging, and to continue organizing the floating of the timber along the big rivers. In Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, under the personal mobilization and leadership of leading comrades such as the secretary, minister, and county magistrate, more than 31,000 people from ten people's communes along the river, as well as agencies, groups, schools, enterprises, and residents, went all out, and organized wooden boats, motor boats, and bamboo rafts to participate in the salvage.

### 南方十省趁春水集运木材

    南方十省趁春水集运木材
    本报讯  我国南方十个省区，正抓紧春水季节，大力进行集运木材工作。
    南方十省区生产的木材，主要是靠水路运输，木材伐倒以后，通过一段陆运运到小溪、小河边，再由小溪、小河放运到大河。小溪、小河的运输受季节性的限制很大，只有在春水季节才便于木材流送。据统计：到今年1月底为止，南方安徽、浙江等十个省区的木材砍伐任务已完成了全年计划的74％，其中存在山上的就有50％，运到小溪边的有13％，运到大河边和公路边的各占4.5％和3％，运到贮木场的只有2.7％，因此，集中力量完成集运木材任务，已成为完成全年生产任务的关键。最近，林业部在武汉召开的南方十省区木材生产会议上，要求南方十个省区现在必须着重抓集运工作，把要通过水运的木材全部运到小河边，为春水流送充分作好准备。要求6月底以前把全年生产的80％的木材抢运到大河边，秋季就干枯的河流，要求提早全部抢运出来，力争在9月底基本上完成今年木材生产集运任务。各省区在今年上半年将以陆运（指在山上集运木材）和小溪流送为中心，带动整个木材生产的全面大跃进。
    现在各省区已开始行动起来。安徽各地趁长江、淮河和新安江各干支流出现几次大水的时机，广泛发动群众突击小河运输，掀起了一个抢运木材的高潮。最近，运到贮木场和途中调拨的木材已有五万立方公尺；毛竹二十五万根，突破小河关，运到大河的木材已达十一万四千二百立方公尺，运到大河的毛竹有一百一十六万根。在这场抢运中，芜湖专区一马当先，在地委县委的领导下，发动了三万八千多民工，在五、六天内，从小河抢运到大河的木材就有两万立方公尺。浙江省景宁县从2月17日开始“赶羊”流送，仅林业部门两天就推河八千三百立方公尺。昌化县至2月19日已放运木材一千四百二十七立方公尺，并已有一千五百立方公尺扎排待运。开化县县委召开电话会议，要求抓紧季节，3月完成五万立方公尺，二季度完成全年任务。
    在大力组织放运的同时，各地都抓紧抢捞漂失木材工作。浙江建德县至2月19日已打捞木材一千一百多立方公尺。这个县的县委书记亲自挂帅，布置各地在抢捞的同时，把小溪木材全部运到大河边，大河边的木材继续组织放运。浙江富阳县在书记、部长、县长等领导同志亲自动员、带头打捞下，沿江十个人民公社和机关、团体、学校、企业、居民等三万一千多人，全力以赴，并组织木船、机动船、竹排参加抢捞。（附图片）
