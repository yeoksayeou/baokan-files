This newspaper reports from Nanjing: Since the beginning of spring this year, a vigorous competition for high quality, high yield, and low cost has unfolded on the iron and steel front in Jiangsu Province, greatly improving the production level of small blast furnaces. In January and February, a total of 54,700 tons of pig iron were produced, completing the state-assigned first-quarter pig iron production plan more than a month ahead of schedule. The province's blast furnace utilization coefficient in February has increased from 0.76 in January to 0.88. The sulfur content of the iron has generally been reduced to below 0.1%, fully meeting the Ministry of Metallurgy's temporary quality standards. The average coke ratio in January was 1.71, and in February, it further decreased to 1.4. The unit cost in various regions has generally decreased by more than 10%. This competition began in mid-February.

The Yangzhou Steel Plant was the first to raise the red flag, issuing a competition initiative to all steel plants in the province. The plant proposed targets of ensuring a blast furnace utilization coefficient of 1.5, with all quality meeting the standard of "purple mouth" iron; sulfur content not exceeding 0.04%, and a iron-to-coke ratio of one to one. Following closely, the Nantong Steel Plant, Xuzhou Huaihai Steel Plant, Suzhou Xujiang Steel Plant, and Nanjing Yuejin Steel Plant all launched a competition to "catch up with Yangzhou, surpass Yangzhou." In the competition, the steel plants actively engaged in technical innovation, continuously increasing production, improving quality, and reducing the coke ratio. The No. 5 blast furnace (28 cubic meters) of the Xuzhou Huaihai Steel Plant originally had low production. During the competition, it improved a series of equipment and operations. On February 24, its daily pig iron production jumped to 40.217 tons, with a utilization coefficient of 1.52, a coke ratio of 0.836, and a cost of 125.8 yuan, creating a new record for comprehensive leap forward of small blast furnaces in the province.

During the competition centered on high quality, high yield, and low cost, the leading cadres of many steel plants personally went deep into the furnace front, tightly grasped measures, and studied and solved problems as they arose. Hu Yangqing, the Party branch secretary of the Yangzhou Steel Plant, carried out political and ideological work in front of the furnace, promoting the solution of key issues. Many factories improved various management systems and consolidated production achievements through competition. After the Nantong Steel Plant implemented the economic accounting system, the cost of pig iron was significantly reduced.

Currently, all steel plants in the province are determined to increase pig iron production in March and strive to further improve quality and reduce costs.

This newspaper reports from Zhengzhou: Henan Province achieved a victory in the doubling of steel production in February. The province's daily pig iron production, starting from February 26, has risen from an average of 1,400 tons per day from January 1 to February 15 to over 3,000 tons, exceeding the doubling target of 3,000 tons of iron per day in late February proposed by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The province's pig iron production has increased rapidly. On February 26, the pig iron production was 3,017 tons (including 1,365 tons of gray pig iron). By the 28th, it had surged to 3,922 tons (including 1,590 tons of gray pig iron). From February 20 to the end of February, in nine days, the province produced a total of 24,283 tons of iron (11,075 tons of gray pig iron), exceeding the target proposed by the Provincial Party Committee by 283 tons.

This doubling of steel production movement was launched after the telephone conference convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on February 19. Not only has production increased, but quality has also greatly improved. As early as the beginning of February, all the employees of the 13-cubic-meter blast furnace of the Jiaozuo City Zhongzhan United Steel Plant, all the employees of the Xinyang City Datong Steel Plant, and the coal mining team led by Liu Jiuxue, proposed a grand plan to double steel and coal production and launched a friendly competition with steel warriors and workers throughout the province. This initiative was immediately met with enthusiastic responses from the majority of workers, especially the steel warriors. They revised their leap forward plans one after another. At this time, the Provincial Party Committee proposed launching a movement to double steel production, which further promoted the widespread development of red flag competitions on the steel front. Striving to complete the annual steel production plan before National Day this year has become the goal of steel warriors.

On the basis of the initial victory in February, all localities are now unifiedly planning steel production according to the spirit of "one game of chess," taking active measures, and fighting hard in March, striving to continue to improve the level of daily production. (Attached picture)

The workers on the iron and steel front in Jiangsu Province completed the first quarter pig iron production task assigned by the state more than a month ahead of schedule. This is a large batch of iron ingots produced by the Yangzhou Steel Plant.

### 江苏小高炉开展优质高产低成本竞赛  喜报首季生铁生产计划提早完成  河南二月下旬生铁日产量上升到三千多吨

    江苏小高炉开展优质高产低成本竞赛
    喜报首季生铁生产计划提早完成
    河南二月下旬生铁日产量上升到三千多吨
    本报南京讯　今年入春以来，江苏省钢铁战线上展开了一场热火朝天的优质、高产、低成本的竞赛，小高炉生产水平大大提高。1、2月份共计生产生铁五万四千七百余吨，提前一个多月完成了国家下达的第一季度生铁生产计划。2月份全省高炉利用系数已从今年1月份的零点七六提高到零点八八，铁的含硫量一般已降低到0.1％以下，完全符合冶金部的暂行质量标准。1月份平均焦比一点七一，2月份又下降到一点四。各地的单位成本一般降低了10％以上。这场竞赛开始于2月中旬。
    第一个举起了红旗向全省钢铁厂发出竞赛倡议的是扬州市钢铁厂。该厂倡议指标保证高炉利用系数一点五，质量全部紫口铁；含硫不过0.04％，铁与焦的比例为一比一。紧跟着南通钢铁厂、徐州淮海钢铁厂、苏州胥江钢铁厂、南京跃进钢铁厂都纷纷展开了“赶扬州、超扬州”的竞赛。竞赛中各钢铁厂都大闹技术革新，不断提高了产量、质量，降低了焦比。徐州淮海钢铁厂的五号高炉（二十八立方公尺）原来产量很低，在竞赛中改进了一系列的设备和操作，2月24日日产生铁一跃而为四十点二一七吨，利用系数一点五二，焦比零点八三六，成本一百二十五点八元，创造了全省小高炉全面跃进的新纪录。
    在优质、高产、低成本为中心内容的竞赛过程中，许多钢铁厂的领导干部，都亲自深入到炉边，紧紧抓住措施，临时发生问题，随时便研究解决。扬州钢铁厂支部书记胡仰清，就在炉前开展政治思想工作，推动关键问题的解决。许多厂通过竞赛健全了各项管理制度，巩固了生产成绩。南通钢铁厂推行了经济核算制以后，生铁的成本就显著地降低了。
    目前，全省各钢铁厂决心要在3月份增产更多生铁，并为进一步提高质量，降低成本而努力。
    本报郑州讯　河南省2月份钢铁生产翻番运动告捷，全省的生铁日产量从2月26日起，已由1月1日到2月15日平均日产一千四百吨上升到三千余吨，超过了中共河南省委提出的2月下旬日产铁三千吨的翻番指标。
    全省生铁产量上升很快。2月26日产铁三千零一十七吨（其中灰生铁一千三百六十五吨），到28日就猛增到三千九百二十二吨（其中灰生铁一千五百九十吨）。从2月20日到2月底的九天内，全省共产铁二万四千二百八十三吨（灰生铁一万一千零七十五吨），超额二百八十三吨完成了省委提出的指标。
    这次钢铁生产翻番运动，是在中共河南省委2月19日召开的电话会议以后开展起来的。不仅产量提高，而且质量也有很大提高。早在2月初，战斗在钢铁战线上的焦作市中站联合钢铁厂十三立方公尺高炉全体职工，信阳市大同钢铁厂的全体职工以及刘九学领导的采煤队，提出了一个钢铁、煤炭生产翻番的宏伟计划，并以此向全省钢铁战士和广大职工展开友谊竞赛。这个倡议发出后，立即得到了广大职工、首先是钢铁战士的热烈响应。他们纷纷修订了跃进计划。这个时候，省委提出了开展钢铁生产翻番运动的号召，更加促进了钢铁战线上红旗竞赛的广泛开展。力争今年国庆节前完成全年钢铁生产计划，已成为钢铁战士的奋斗目标。
    在2月份初获胜利的基础上，现在各地正根据一盘棋的精神，统一规划钢铁生产，采取积极措施，大战3月份，力争日产水平继续提高。（附图片）
