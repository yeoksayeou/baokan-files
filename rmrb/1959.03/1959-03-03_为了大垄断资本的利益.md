Last year was a year of "regression" in French history, a year of drastic retreat from democracy. An autocratic regime was established under the guise of the "Fifth Republic." Financial capital and the big bourgeoisie today preside over the French economy and politics more openly than ever before, and are virtually completely beyond the control of Parliament.

In December 1958, the French government made a number of decisions regarding the monetary system, trade and budget by administrative decree. These decisions are so significant and cover such a wide range of areas that it is still difficult to determine all the consequences they may cause.

However, the initial results of these measures have been felt by most French people. It is first manifested in new sharp increases in the prices of food and necessities, expensive rents, increased postage and transportation costs, and rising electricity, gas and other service charges. At the same time, direct and indirect taxes levied on residents have also increased. In addition, various social allowances won by the French working people through years of struggle have also been cancelled or reduced. Subsidies for patients, pregnant women and other subsidies have also been cut.

Along with workers and staff, poor and middle peasants as well as small and medium-sized bourgeoisie have also suffered from the new measures. The state's reduction of subsidies to farmers for the acquisition of agricultural tools, agricultural equipment, fertilizers and gasoline, and the cancellation of the maintenance of prices for many agricultural products, have particularly severely hit agricultural producers.

So what is the purpose of the French government's announcement of new fiscal and economic policies?

The measures taken in terms of the monetary system, budget, expansion of taxes and reduction of social subsidies are primarily to pay for the ever-increasing war expenses of the Algerian War.

The adoption of some measures in trade is due to the entry into force of the European "Common Market" and the pressure from other capitalist countries on France. As everyone knows, this refers to the issue of "liberalization," that is, the issue of France partially lifting restrictions on the quantity of imports of certain industrial and agricultural products. The actual percentage of French "liberalization" of imports from Western European countries has reached 70% (formally 90%), and 50% for countries in the dollar area.

When the French government allows foreign goods cheaper than similar domestic products to enter its domestic market unchecked, it hopes that domestic prices can be stabilized for a period of time, or at least rise more slowly. It must be pointed out that imports of some products that pose a risk of fierce competition to France's most important industrial sectors still maintain certain restrictions. For example, imports of machine tools, automobiles and woolen products are still subject to restrictions.

The devaluation of the franc serves two purposes. On the one hand, it can make French goods cheap abroad, thereby increasing exports; on the other hand, it is also to alleviate the difficulties of the transition to "liberalization" of foreign trade and the "Common Market," because the increase in the price of imported goods will limit their import volume.

In addition to devaluation, the franc has also implemented limited free convertibility. This measure and a series of other decisions are aimed at attracting foreign capital inflows, which is incompatible with the true interests of the French nation.

To understand the reasons that prompted the French government to take all these measures, it is necessary to first look at the international obligations undertaken by France. The "Common Market" Treaty and many other agreements have closely tied France's economy to the economies of other participating countries in "Little Europe" and the United States.

The implementation of limited free convertibility of the franc is an example. The decision by thirteen Western European countries to implement free convertibility of their currencies was the most significant event in Western countries' economic relations last year. Due to the gradual reduction of tariff barriers, the limited free convertibility of currencies in various Western European countries has given greater "freedom" to international trade within the capitalist world, which is precisely one of the main political and economic goals of the United States.

The free convertibility of Western European currencies has been prepared for many years. However, such plans have encountered great obstacles. Only in 1958 did many conditions appear that made it possible to achieve it. These conditions are: the United Kingdom has been able to balance its foreign trade payments and expand its gold and foreign exchange reserves; Italy, the Netherlands and some other countries have improved their balance of payments. However, it seems that the most important thing is that West Germany believes that implementing free convertibility can expand its exports. The German mark has become one of the "hardest" currencies second only to the dollar, and it has also provided the largest amount of loans to other Western European countries.

After this situation occurred, although France was in a very unfavorable situation (frequent imbalances in payments and very thin gold and foreign exchange reserves), it had no choice but to follow others.

The "Common Market Treaty" signed by France obliges France to strictly abide by its provisions. As everyone knows, this treaty stipulates that tariffs must be gradually reduced. The impact of the tariff reduction in 1959 will not be particularly obvious. Because in this year, tariffs on imported goods were only reduced by about 2%. However, another clause in the treaty stipulates that imports within the "Common Market" must be expanded. This year, every item of goods imported by France from other "Common Market" member states should be allowed to reach 3% of its domestic production. This is a very serious matter.

These decisions and obligations made earlier have put the new French government in an extremely difficult situation. Due to the increasing financial, economic and military burden in Algeria, this has made it even more difficult for France to cope. In this case, the French government had to devalue the franc. At the end of last year, French prices were on average 8% to 10% higher than other countries. Maintaining the previous exchange rate would reduce its exports and eventually lead to trade and economic stagnation.

Of course, these kinds of "failures" of France on the international stage and the pressure exerted on it by other countries cannot explain the whole problem. But these things once again show France's weak position in the Western camp.

Although France has also achieved certain economic achievements, it lags behind West Germany or the United Kingdom. Its production structure itself makes it a country that exports very few industrial manufactured goods but needs to import a large amount of raw materials and fuel (power products). As a result, its foreign trade cannot be balanced for a long time.

French imperialism regards the discovery of large oil reserves in the Sahara Desert as a blessing, believing that this will, even if it cannot completely eliminate it, at least greatly reduce France's lack of power resources, thereby reducing its payment deficit caused by buying oil from the dollar area and the sterling area. However, on the one hand, due to the continuation of the Algerian War, and on the other hand, due to the large-scale invasion of the Sahara by American oil trusts, these hopes are easily dashed.

Of course, after the Second World War, France could have corrected the imbalance in its production structure. To this end, it must strengthen its industrialization and take various measures to develop trade, especially to show sufficient courage in expanding trade with socialist countries and greatly reduce military spending. However, the French bourgeoisie, who only care about their own class interests, have chosen another path: the path of colonial war and participation in the North Atlantic Group, which can only lead France to greater difficulties.

Many of the measures taken not long ago that are unrelated to the international situation (the international situation only accelerated the implementation of these measures) reflect a consistent political and economic line. From the "philosophical" arguments on which these measures are based, they were planned long ago. To implement these measures, it is necessary to change the balance of class forces in French society. The events of May 1958, the direct occupation of government positions by representatives of large banks, the implementation of an autocratic constitution, and the reactionary elections in November 1958 have all increased the courage of the French bourgeoisie, making them even more rampant.

Today, the French bourgeoisie believes that for the first time in decades, they have been able to openly and arbitrarily implement their policies without making any compromises to other classes, and in the future, they no longer need to consider the support of the masses when taking measures. The bourgeoisie believes that in order to make the French economy "healthy," the measures they propose must be implemented. In their view, the meaning of "healthy" refers to greatly strengthening the strength of monopoly capital and large industrial enterprises, accelerating the modernization of equipment in certain production sectors, and eliminating some small and medium-sized enterprises.

The French bourgeoisie is trying its best to establish closer ties with foreign competitors, but they are also a little worried about this matter. In addition, many cartel agreements concluded within the "Common Market" are talking loudly about implementing a policy of vigorously strengthening large companies and enterprises. However, for this purpose, it is necessary (as stipulated in the current budget) to maintain an extremely high level of national investment, and at the same time, it is necessary to create the best conditions for private investment both in France and abroad. In short, French financial capital not only wants to retain the profits that the most modern economic sectors can obtain, but also wants to expand this profit. However, the French economy cannot afford all the expenses caused by the Algerian War, participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the need to modernize production while resisting foreign competition without lowering or even maintaining the actual lives of the people. So the French ruling class decided to launch a new offensive against the interests of the working people, the petty bourgeoisie, and even the middle bourgeoisie, in order to achieve its goals.

Similar decisions that violate the wishes of the working people have never been implemented in such an open and shameless manner. The planners of these decisions make no secret of the fact that the next two years will be very difficult. They foresee that large-scale protest movements will break out in both urban and rural areas. But the bourgeoisie believes that they now have enough strength to repel the counterattack of the masses. The latter is still in a state of division in politics as before.

The French bourgeoisie believes that they can persist with borrowing and attracting foreign investment even with increased unemployment, slowing down the pace of expansion to some extent, and even slightly implementing contraction, until they can massively utilize the resources recently discovered in the Sahara to increase (even relatively) the strength of French imperialism against its foreign allies. Because these allies are also its enemies.

In a word, the French ruling group only understands the words "restoring the greatness of France" as restoring the "greatness" of French financial capital, a dubious prospect. To achieve this goal, it does not hesitate to sacrifice the French people. This adventurous policy is too dangerous in terms of the international background and too cruel to the domestic people. The task of French workers and democrats is to unite and point out to France the true path to restoring the French economy and democracy, a path that is in line with the true national interests of France.

    为了大垄断资本的利益
    法国“经济和政治”杂志主编  让·普伦托
    去年在法国历史上是“跃退”的一年，是从民主制度急剧撤退的一年。一个专制政权在
  “第五共和”的招牌下建立了起来。金融资本和大资产阶级今天比任何时候都更加公开地主持着法国的经济和政治，而且实际上完全不受议会的控制。
    1958年12月法国政府曾以行政命令作出了关于货币制度、贸易和预算的许多决定。这些决定影响是如此重大，涉及的方面是如此之广，以至目前还很难确定它们可能造成的全部后果。
    但是这些措施的初步结果已为大多数法国人所感觉到。它首先由食品和生活必需品价格新的急剧上涨，房租昂贵，邮费和交通费用增加，电费、煤气和其他服务费用上升表现出来。同时向居民征收的直接和间接税也增加了。此外，法国劳动人民经过多年斗争赢得的各种社会津贴也被取消或缩减。病人、孕妇的补助以及其他补贴也削减了。
    同工人和职员一道，贫农、中农以及中小资产阶级也吃到新措施的苦头。国家对农民取得农具、农业设备、肥料和汽油的补助费的削减，许多农产品价格维持的取消，特别厉害地打击了农业生产者。
    那么法国政府公布新的财政和经济政策究竟为了什么目的？
    在货币制度、预算、扩大税收和减缩社会补贴方面所采取的措施，首先是为了支付阿尔及利亚战争日益增长的战费。
    在贸易方面一些措施的采取，则是由于欧洲“共同市场”的生效和其他资本主义国家对法国的压力促成的。大家知道，这里所指的是有关“自由化”的问题，即法国部分取消对某些工农业产品入口数量限制的问题。法国对西欧国家进口“自由化”的实际百分比已达到70％
  （形式上是90％），对美元区国家则达到50％。
    法国政府在允许比本国同类产品便宜的外国货长驱进入本国市场的时候，指望国内的物价能因此稳定一个时期，或至少上涨得慢一些。必须指出，对法国最重要的工业部门有激烈竞争危险的一些产品的进口仍然保持了一定限制。例如机床、汽车和羊毛制品的入口仍然实行限制。
    法郎贬值是为了两个目的。一方面，它可以使法国货在国外价格低廉，从而增加出口；另一方面，也是为了减轻对外贸易“自由化”和“共同市场”过渡时的困难，因为入口品价格的上涨会限制它们的输入量。
    除了贬值以外，法郎还实行了有限制的自由兑换。这一措施和其他一系列的决定都是为了吸引外国资本流入，而这同法国民族的真正利益是不相容的。
    要了解促使法国政府采取所有这些措施的原因，必须先看一下法国所承担的国际义务。“共同市场”条约和许多其他协定已把法国的经济和“小欧洲”其他参加国以及美国的经济紧紧地捆在一起。
    法郎实行有限制自由兑换就是一个例子。西欧十三个国家对本国货币实行自由兑换的决定，是去年西方国家经济关系上一件最重大事件。由于关税壁垒的逐渐降低，各个西欧国家货币的有限制自由兑换就使资本主义世界内部的国际贸易有了较大的“自由”，而这正是美国主要的政治和经济目的之一。
    西欧国家货币的自由兑换，已准备了许多年。但是，这类计划曾遇到很大障碍。只是在1958年出现了许多条件，才使它得以实现。这些条件是：英国已能平衡它的对外贸易支付，并扩大它的黄金外汇储备；意大利、荷兰和其他一些国家的支付平衡，都有了改善。但是，看来，最主要的还是由于西德认为实行自由兑换能扩大它的出口。西德的马克已成为仅次于美元的最“硬”货币之一，它还向西欧其他国家提供了最大量的贷款。
    在出现这种情况之后，尽管法国处境很不利（经常支付不能平衡，黄金外汇储备很单薄），它也只好跟着别人走了。
    法国签署的“共同市场条约”责成法国必须严格遵守它的规定。大家知道，这个条约规定要逐步减低关税。在1959年降低关税的影响还不会特别明显的感觉出来。因为这一年对进口货只降低2％左右。但是条约中另外一项条款规定必须扩大“共同市场”内部的进口。就在今年法国从其他“共同市场”成员国进口的每项商品都应当允许其达到本国产量的3％。这就是一件十分严重的事。
    这些早先作出的决定和义务，使法国的新政府陷入异常困难处境中。由于在阿尔及利亚的财政和经济军事负担日益增长，这使法国更加应付维艰。法国政府在这种情况下不得不实行法郎贬值。去年年底法国物价平均比其他国家高8％到10％。如果保持以前的汇率就会使它的出口减缩，最后带来贸易和经济的停滞。
    当然，仅是法国在国际舞台上的这类“失败”和其他国家对它所施加的压力，还不能说明全部问题。可是这些东西却再次显示了法国在西方阵营中处境的软弱。
    法国虽然也取得了一定的经济成就，但是落后于西德或英国。它的生产机构本身，使它成为一个工业制成品出口很少但却需要大量原料和燃料（动力产品）进口的国家。结果使它的对外贸易长期不能平衡。
    法国帝国主义把在撒哈拉沙漠发现大量石油蕴藏看作是一种福音，认为这即使不能完全消除、至少也会大大减少法国动力资源的不足，从而减轻它由于向美元区和英镑区买石油所造成的支付逆差。但是，一方面由于阿尔及利亚战争的持续，另一方面由于美国石油托辣斯的大举侵入撒哈拉，这些指望就很容易落空。
    当然，二次大战结束后，法国本来能够改正它的生产结构中的不平衡。为此它必须加强本国的工业化，并采取多方面措施来发展贸易，特别是在扩大同社会主义国家贸易中表现足够的勇气，大大缩减军费。但是只顾自己的阶级利益的法国资产阶级，却选择了另外一条路：殖民战争和参加北大西洋集团的道路，这条路只能把法国带向更大的困难。
    不久前所采取的许多同国际形势无关的措施（国际形势只是加速了这些措施的实现），反映了一种一贯的政治和经济路线。从这些措施所根据的“哲学”论据来说，它们是早经策划好了的。为实现这些措施，就必须改变法国社会中阶级力量的对比。而1958年5月的事变、大银行代表的直接占据政府要职、专制的宪法的实施以及1958年11月的反动选举都增加了法国资产阶级的勇气，使他们变得更加猖獗起来。
    今天法国资产阶级以为，几十年来他们已能够第一次公开地和专断地不向其他阶级作任何通融就来执行自己的政策，今后它们已不必要在采取措施时还考虑人民群众的支持。资产阶级认为，为了使法国经济能够“健康起来”，他们提出的措施必须实施。而所谓“健康起来”的含意，在他们看来就是指大大加强垄断资本和大工业企业的实力，加速某些生产部门设备的现代化和消灭一部分中小企业。
    法国资产阶级竭力想同外国竞争者建立较密切联系，可是他们对这件事又有点担心。另外在“共同市场”范围内缔结的许多卡特尔协定，则在大谈其要实行大力加强大公司和企业的政策。但是，为此就必须（现在预算中也这样规定）保持国家投资的极高水平，同时在法国国内和国外还必须为私人投资建立最良好的条件。总而言之，法国金融资本不仅要保有最现代化的经济部门所能取得的利润，而且还要把这项利润加以扩大。但是法国的经济在对抗外国竞争并不降低或者甚至保持人民实际生活的同时，却担负不起因阿尔及利亚战争、参加北大西洋公约组织、必须使生产现代化而引起的全部开支。于是法国统治阶级就决定对劳动人民、小资产阶级，甚至中等资产阶级的利益展开新的进攻，由此来达到它的目的。
    违反劳动人民愿望的类似决定还从没有以这样公然无耻的方式被付诸实施过。这些决定的策划者毫不掩饰，今后两年将是非常艰苦的。他们预见到无论在城市和乡村中，都会爆发大规模的抗议运动。但是资产阶级却认为现在他们已有足够的力量来打退人民群众的反击。后者在政治上现在仍同以前一样处于分裂状态。
    法国资产阶级认为，他们在增加失业、多少放慢扩张速度、甚至稍稍实行收缩的情况下，也能用借贷和吸引外资的办法坚持下去，直到能够大规模利用最近在撒哈拉发现的富源来增大（哪怕是相对地）法帝国主义对它的外国同盟者的实力时为止。因为这些同盟者也就是它的敌手。
    一句话，法国统治集团把“恢复法兰西的伟大”的话只理解为恢复法国金融资本的“伟大”这样一个可疑的前景。为了实现这一目的，甚至不惜牺牲法国人民。这一冒险的政策就国际背景来说是太危险了，对国内人民说则是太残酷了。法国劳动者和民主人士的任务，就是要团结起来，向法国指出真正恢复法国经济和民主的道路，指出符合法国真正的民族利益的道路。（译自2月21日苏联“消息报”）（附图片）
