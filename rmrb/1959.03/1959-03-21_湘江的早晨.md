The Xiang River in the Morning
Zhu Yuhua

The early spring morning makes the Xiang River appear exceptionally beautiful. The river is covered in a vast expanse of white mist. A ship departs from Changsha, fully loaded with passengers and rice, heading towards Hankou; ships from Xiangtan and Zhuzhou, greet the dawn as they head for Changsha. And so, the Xiang River becomes busy!

The fishing team of the Dongfeng People's Commune, went down to the river to fish before dawn. Today everyone is especially excited, and they are all talking about the commune's "Full Load of Gold." "Full Load of Gold" is a fertilizer collecting team selected from the young men of the commune. A few days ago, they went up the mountains to collect fertilizer, and yesterday they sent a message saying they would be coming down the mountain this morning. The members of the fishing team all want to see what exactly the "Full Load of Gold" has loaded up with "gold."

Yongqing, the old captain of the fishing team, stood at the bow of the boat, shaking the fishing net, while turning his head to say to the young girl rowing the boat: "Little sister, row faster, catch a few nets before 'Full Load of Gold' arrives!" Yongqing said, his face full of smiles, and with a "whoosh" he swung the net down. The little sister at the stern gently rowed the oars, smiling and saying, "Uncle Yongqing, the wind is so good this morning, 'Full Load of Gold' will have a smooth journey down the mountain!" Yongqing said while pulling the net, "With favorable wind and rain, we'll have a good harvest every year! Once our 'Full Load of Gold' comes down the mountain, the grain in the fields will double! Hey, double!" As he spoke, the net was pulled onto the boat, and only white fish were seen jumping and bouncing in the net. Yongqing couldn't contain the joy in his heart and said to the little sister, "Little sister, look, the Xiang River is simply a treasure bowl, with endless fish and inexhaustible grain. Hey, a sip of this sweet Xiang River water, and you're full even without eating all day!" The little sister said, "Uncle, Faxiang and the others are 'Full Load of Gold,' what about us, let's call us 'Full Load of Silver'!"

"Full Load of Silver, good! Good!" Yongqing rejoiced, he stroked his white beard, and composed a doggerel, singing in a bold Xiang opera tune:

	Full load of silver, full load of gold,
	Our commune rides the east wind,
	The east wind urges the willows to turn green,
	Our old man, white hair turns green,
	Just like that, ah, yo,
	Young man!

This singing made everyone on the river laugh. The fishermen cast their nets while shouting at Yongqing, "Uncle, you really sound like a young man when you sing like that!" Someone with a long tongue shouted, "I say, uncle, marry an eighteen-year-old girl, and you'll be a young couple!" The little sister also giggled. Yongqing was about to flare up, but suddenly said seriously, "Don't make noise, look ahead!"

Ahead, dark shadows of boats were heading towards them, the fog hadn't completely dissipated, and their faces couldn't be seen clearly. Yongqing said, "Could it be 'Full Load of Gold' coming!" The little sister stood on tiptoe, looking left and right, her heart pounding.

The shadows of the boats gradually approached, and only saw a large flag fluttering in the air on the bow of the leading boat. In the morning breeze, came the sound of oars, and heroic Xiang opera singing.

A burst of "chira-la-la" of oar sounds went from far to near, and in a moment, the words on the flag could be seen clearly, on the bright red flag, were written big golden characters: Dongfeng People's Commune, Full Load of Gold. A person stood below the flag, shouting from afar, "Uncle Yongqing, good morning!"

The fishing boat burst into cheers. Yongqing grinned and shouted:

	"Still early? You must have come down the mountain at dawn!"

Faxiang under the flag replied, "That's right, we loaded the mountain fertilizer onto the boat in the middle of the night, and set sail at dawn, spring plowing is in full swing, and the commune is waiting for fertilizer!"

More than a dozen white sails bulged and sailed "whoosh, whoosh." Yongqing saw that the dozens of pontoon boats were all piled high with fertilizer. Yongqing said, "Faxiang, where did you get so much from?"

"Full Load of Gold" approached, and Faxiang said, "The bird droppings in the caves that have been there for thousands of years have been dug out by us!" The young men on the boat only cared about singing Xiang opera, and the old man couldn't hear clearly for a long time, making him stomp his feet in anxiety.

Faxiang was holding a bunch of mountain flowers. When his boat and Yongqing's fishing boat approached, he threw the mountain flowers to the little sister, and greeted her, "Little sister, these are the earliest forsythia flowers blooming on Yuelu Mountain, for you!" The little sister took the flowers, and just wanted to say something, but Faxiang's boat had already sailed past "whoosh, whoosh." More than a dozen boats followed, the sound of oars, the sound of singing, the sound of water, all mixed together. Yongqing looked at the "Full Load of Gold" speeding towards the ferry, and loudly greeted the fishermen, "Commune members, let's work hard, we can't fall behind them!" As he spoke, he shook the fishing net, stretched his waist, and with a "whack" cast the net down, followed by dozens of rows of fishing nets also casting down "whack, whack," and countless waves splashed on the river. The little sister rowed the oars, her heart full of sweetness.

At this time, the fog had completely dissipated, the morning sun shone on the Xiang River, and the Xiang River was golden.

    湘江的早晨
    祝玉华
    初春的早晨，湘江显得分外美丽。江上一片白茫茫的大雾。轮船从长沙起航了，满载着旅客和大米，向汉口驶去；从湘潭、株洲开来的轮船，迎着黎明向长沙驶来。于是，湘江上就这样忙碌起来了！
    东风人民公社的捕鱼队，天麻麻亮就下江捕鱼了。今天人们格外兴奋，大家都在谈着社里的“满舱金”。“满舱金”是社里挑选出来的小伙子组成的积肥队，前几天他们上山采肥去了，昨天带信来说，今天早晨就要下山。捕鱼队的人都想看个究竟，看看“满舱金”装了多少“金子”下山来。
    捕鱼队分队长永青老倌，站在船头上，一边抖着鱼网，一边扭回头对摇桨的细妹子说：“细妹子，摇快点，乘‘满舱金’还没来，赶它几网罗！”永青老倌满面春风地说着，呼的一声抡下网。后艄的细妹子轻轻地摇着桨，笑着说：“永青大伯，今早风向多好，‘满舱金’一下山，就一帆风顺哩！”永青老倌一边拉网，一边说：“风调雨顺，年年丰收！咱们的‘满舱金’一下山，田里的粮食翻一番！嘿，翻一番！”他说着，网已经拉上船上来了，只见白花花的鱼儿在网里跳来蹦去，永青老倌捺不住心里的高兴，对细妹子说：“细妹子，你看，这湘江简直是个聚宝盆啊，打不尽的鱼，吃不完的粮。嘿，喝一口这甜蜜蜜的湘江水，一天不吃饭也饱饱的！”细妹子说：“大伯，发祥他们是‘满舱金’，我们哪，就叫‘满舱银’！”
    “满舱银，好！好！”永青老倌乐了，他捋着那把花白胡子，编了一句顺口溜，用粗犷的湘歌唱道：
    满舱银，满舱金，
    咱们的公社乘东风，
    东风催得柳发青，
    咱老汉，白发转成青，
    活像那个呀儿哟，
    年轻人！
    这一唱，江面上可笑开了。渔人们一边撒网，一边朝永青老倌嚷道：“大伯，你这一唱，可真像个年轻人呢！”不知哪个长舌头大嚷道：“我说大伯，再娶个十八岁的姑娘，可就是年轻夫妻啦！”细妹子也格格格的笑开了。永青老倌正要发作，但却忽然一本正经地说：“你们快别闹，看那前面！”
    前方，黑呼呼的船影向这边驶来，大雾还未完全消散，看不清面貌。永青老倌说：“说不定是‘满舱金’来啦！”细妹子踮起脚尖，左看右看，心里怦怦地跳。
    船影渐渐近了，只见为首一只船头上，飘着一杆大旗，在空中哗哗作响。晨风中，传来桨声，豪迈的湘歌声。
    一阵嗤拉拉的桨声由远而近，一会儿，那面大旗上的字看得清楚了，鲜红的大旗上，写着斗大的金字：东风人民公社，满舱金。大旗下边立着一个人，老远就朝这边喊道：“永青大伯，你们早啊！”
    渔船上沸腾起来了。永青老倌咧着嘴喊道：
    “还早？你们怕是五更天就下山了吧！”
    大旗下的发祥答道：“可不是，半夜就把山肥装上船，五更天就起锚了，春耕闹得欢，社里等着要肥料呢！”
    十几只白帆鼓着肚子呼呼呼地驶来，永青老倌看见那十几只跳板子船上，都堆着尖溜溜的肥料。永青老倌说：“发祥，你们从哪儿搞来这么多？”
    “满舱金”驶近了，发祥说：“几千年的山洞里的鸟粪被我们挖来了！”船上的小伙子只顾唱湘歌，老汉半天听不清话，急得他直跺脚。
    发祥手中拿着一束山花，当他的船和永青老倌的渔船靠近时，他将山花抛给细妹子，打了个招呼说：“细妹，这是岳麓山上开得最早的迎春花，给你！”细妹子接过花，正想说什么，发祥的船已经呼呼地驶过去了。十几只船跟着驶过，桨声、歌声、水声，混成一团。永青老倌瞧着向渡口驰去的“满舱金”，大声招呼渔人们说：“社员们，咱们干罗，可不能落在他们后面！”说着，他抖了抖鱼网，一伸腰，哗的一声撒下网，跟着几十排鱼网也哗哗地撒下了，江面上顿时飞起无数浪花。细妹子摇着桨，心里甜蜜蜜的。
    这时候，大雾完全消散了，朝阳照在湘江上，湘江上一片金黄。
