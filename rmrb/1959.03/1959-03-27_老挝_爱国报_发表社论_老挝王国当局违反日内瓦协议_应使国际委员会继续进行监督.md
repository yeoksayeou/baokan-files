Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th: Vientiane dispatch: The Lao Patriotic Party's official newspaper, the Lao "Patriotic News," published an editorial on February 28th, pointing out that the Geneva Accords on Laos have not been fully implemented, and the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos must resume its activities as soon as possible.

The editorial stated that the statement made by the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Phoui Sananikone, on February 11th, declaring that the Geneva Accords on Laos had been fully implemented, that Laos was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords, and denying the continued existence of the Lao International Commission, has been opposed by the people of Laos and abroad.

The editorial pointed out that the Royal Lao Government has not only failed to fully implement the agreement on the unification of Laos, but is also continuing to take retaliatory measures such as massacre, imprisonment, and torture against former Pathet Lao personnel, and is forcing Lao Patriotic Party members to renounce their party membership. The editorial said that the Lao Royal authorities' attempt to force the withdrawal of the Lao International Commission is precisely to facilitate their above-mentioned retaliatory and persecutory actions.

The editorial emphasized that certain foreigners and some Lao people are attempting to create disunity within Laos on the one hand, and are conspiring to cause disputes between Laos and its neighbors on the other, in order to cause the war to break out again in Laos, so as to transport foreign troops into Laos and turn Laos into a foreign military base. The editorial pointed out that this is contrary to the Geneva Accords and the wishes of the Lao people.

The editorial then refuted the claim that "the continued performance of its duties by the International Commission in Laos will cause Laos to lose its independence and sovereignty." The editorial said that because the task of the International Commission is only to monitor and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords, prevent discrimination and retaliatory actions, prevent foreign interference in Laos' internal affairs, and ensure Laos' security, it enables Laos to obtain genuine independence and sovereignty. The editorial cited the example of the continued activities of the Cambodian International Commission in Cambodia, which not only did not cause Cambodia to lose its independence and sovereignty, but Cambodia's independence and sovereignty became more and more secure as a result.

The editorial said: Therefore, we believe that the Lao International Commission must continue its monitoring and supervisory work so that the Geneva Accords can be fully implemented in Laos.

    老挝“爱国报”发表社论
    老挝王国当局违反日内瓦协议
    应使国际委员会继续进行监督
    新华社河内26日电　万象消息：老挝爱国党的机关报老挝“爱国报”2月28日发表社论指出，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议还没有得到完全的履行，老挝国际监察和监督委员会必须尽快继续进行它的活动。
    社论说，老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空2月11日发表的关于宣称关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议已经得到完全履行、老挝不再受日内瓦协议约束，以及否认老挝国际委员会继续存在的声明，受到老挝国内外人民的反对。
    社论指出，老挝王国政府不但没有完全履行关于老挝统一的协议，而且在继续对前寮国战斗部队人员采取屠杀、监禁、拷打等报复手段，并且强迫老挝爱国党党员脱党。社论说，老挝王国当局企图迫使撤销老挝国际委员会，正是为了便于他们进行上述报复和迫害行动。
    社论强调指出，某些外国人和一些老挝人一方面企图使老挝内部不团结，另一方面阴谋使老挝同邻国发生纠纷，借以使战争重新在老挝爆发，以便把外国军队运入老挝，使老挝变成外国的军事基地。社论指出，这是违背日内瓦协议和老挝人民的愿望的。
    社论接着驳斥了所谓“国际委员会继续在老挝执行自己的任务将使老挝丧失独立和主权”的说法。社论说，由于国际委员会的任务只是监察和监督日内瓦协议的履行，防止歧视和报复行动，不让外国干涉老挝内政，保证老挝的安全，使老挝获得真正的独立和主权。社论举例说，柬埔寨国际委员会的继续在柬埔寨进行活动，不但没有使柬埔寨丧失独立和主权，柬埔寨的独立和主权反而因此越来越有保障。
    社论说：因此，我们认为，老挝国际委员会必须继续进行监察和监督工作，使日内瓦协议在老挝得到完满的履行。
