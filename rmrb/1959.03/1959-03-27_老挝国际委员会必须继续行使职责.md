    The International Commission for Laos Must Continue to Fulfill its Duties
    By People's Daily Commentator
    The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 25th regarding the Laotian situation, expressing the Soviet Union's anxiety about the situation in Laos and suggesting that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference request the International Commission for Laos to resume its practical activities of monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos as soon as possible. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, has taken a solemn stance in safeguarding the Geneva Accords and has received the warm support and heartfelt welcome of the Chinese people and all countries and peoples concerned about peace in Indochina.
    The British government, as the other chairman of the Geneva Conference, bears the same solemn responsibility for upholding the Geneva Accords. The Soviet government is awaiting a response from the British side after making this suggestion to the British government. All people in the world who wish to maintain peace in Indochina, especially the people of all countries closely related to the Indochina situation, are also waiting for a response from the British side. This is entirely understandable.
    Everyone remembers that the British government, together with the Soviet government, stated in a letter to the Indian government on January 31 that the "intermittent recess" of the International Commission for Laos was merely a "procedural decision," which "has nothing to do with the dissolution of the committee," and also believed that "there is no mention in any way of abolishing any provision of the Laos Ceasefire Agreement related to the International Commission, especially Article 39." The two chairmen finally mentioned that they hoped that the chairman of the International Commission for Laos, India, would continue to "actively promote the activities of the committee, in the interest of peace in Indochina," as in the past. It can be seen that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference believe that the International Commission for Laos continues to have the obligation to monitor and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. However, according to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 20 from London, British officials, when the situation in Laos was deteriorating and the Geneva Accords were facing a serious threat, "did not consider it necessary" to reconvene the International Commission to take appropriate measures. On March 25, according to British authoritative sources, the British government believes that since the mission of the International Commission for Laos has been completed, it no longer has any reason to continue to exist. These messages cannot but cause people to feel uneasy. We hope that the British government will take into account the serious situation in Laos, honor its solemn responsibility for the Geneva Accords, and give a positive response to the Soviet government's note as soon as possible.
    Recently, the situation in Laos has become increasingly serious as a result of a series of activities by the Laotian authorities instigated by the United States to abandon the Geneva Accords. After declaring that it would no longer be bound by the Geneva Accords, the Laotian authorities openly announced that from March 20, Vietnamese International Supervisory and Control Commission aircraft flying from Saigon to Hanoi would be prohibited from making stopovers in Laos. At the same time, the Laotian authorities tried to conceal their violation of the Geneva Accords, vigorously persecuting former Pathet Lao personnel, and allowing large quantities of American weapons and ammunition to enter the country, accepting American military personnel, establishing military bases, and so on. According to the Laotian "Patriotic News" on February 28, former Pathet Lao personnel are suffering severe persecution and peace in Laos is threatened. Even Gordon Walker, a reporter for the American "Christian Science Monitor," revealed that former Pathet Lao personnel "will be detained indefinitely in ... a place equivalent to a concentration camp." Not only that, but American imperialism, taking advantage of its increasingly deep control over Laos, has also stepped up its efforts to instigate the pro-American forces in Laos to actively provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and collude with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Laos to invade our border areas. The aim of the United States is to completely destroy the Geneva Accords, control the peaceful and neutral countries of Indochina, in order to expand its aggression against Indochina and create new tensions in Southeast Asia. This conspiracy of the United States has long been no secret. As early as March 9, the "New York Times" editorial openly advocated that the United States now "can train 25,000 Laotian troops, and Laos can freely join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." All these facts show that the demand of the Laotian "Patriotic News" to convene the International Commission for Laos quickly and continue to fulfill its duties in order to maintain peace in Indochina and to maintain the Geneva Accords is entirely in line with the interests of peace in Indochina and should be sympathized with and supported by all the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.
    It should be mentioned here that the attitude shown by India, the chairman of the International Commission for Laos, is welcome. Indian President Prasad pointed out on March 9 that "the members of the International Commission will fully cooperate with each other and obtain the cooperation of the Laotian government to maintain peace." Indian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Menon, also pointed out on March 11 that the Indian government "is working to enable the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos" to, in accordance with the opinions expressed in the recent letter from the two chairmen (of the Geneva Conference) to the Indian government, "deal with issues related to the Geneva Agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos." In the past, the Indian government has made significant contributions to maintaining the Geneva Accords, and we believe that the Indian government will continue to make further contributions to peace in Indochina at this important moment.
    As a signatory to the Geneva Accords and Laos's neighbor, the Chinese people are particularly concerned about peace in Indochina, which is only natural. Recently, Vientiane Radio has distorted the efforts made by the Chinese people to maintain the Geneva Accords as "interference" in Laos's internal affairs, which cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always adhered to a policy of good-neighborliness and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in their foreign relations. The Chinese people sincerely hope to maintain and develop peaceful and friendly good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries, including Laos; but we absolutely cannot allow the United States to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords and realize its conspiracy to expand aggression. It is precisely from this position that the Chinese people firmly demand that the Geneva Accords must be thoroughly implemented in Laos, and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the actions of the Laotian authorities, under the direction of the United States, to continue to abandon the Geneva Accords and threaten peace in Indochina. This is not only directly related to the interests of the Chinese people, but also our solemn responsibility to the Geneva Accords.

    老挝国际委员会必须继续行使职责
    本报评论员
    苏联外交部于25日就老挝局势发表声明，表示了苏联对老挝地区局势的焦虑，并建议由日内瓦会议的两位主席要求老挝国际委员会尽快地继续进行它的监察和监督关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行的实际活动。毫无疑问，作为日内瓦会议主席之一的苏联对于维护日内瓦协议的严正态度受到中国人民和一切关心印度支那和平的国家和人民的热烈支持和衷心的欢迎。
    作为日内瓦会议另一主席的英国政府，对于维护日内瓦协议负有同样的庄严的责任。苏联政府在向英国政府提出这一建议之后，正等待着英国方面的回答。全世界一切愿望维护印度支那和平的人们，特别是与印度支那局势密切相关的各国人民，也在等待着英国方面的回答。这是完全可以理解的。
    大家都记得，英国政府同苏联政府一起曾在1月31日致印度政府的信中认为，老挝国际委员会的“不定期的休会”仅仅是一个“程序性的决定”，它“同解散委员会的问题没有任何关系”，并且还认为，“没有用任何方式提到过关于废止老挝停止敌对行动协定中有关国际委员会的任何条款，特别是第三十九条。”两位主席最后还提到希望老挝国际委员会主席印度仍和过去一样“积极促进委员会的活动，以利于印度支那的和平。”可见日内瓦会议的两位主席都认为老挝国际委员会继续负有监察和监督日内瓦协议在老挝实施的义务。但是，据法新社2月20日发自伦敦的电讯说，英国官方人士在老挝形势趋于恶化。日内瓦协议面临严重威胁的时候，还“并不认为有任何必要”重新召集国际委员会，以采取适当的措施。3月25日，据英国权威人士透露，英国政府认为，由于老挝国际委员会的任务已经完成，它已经没有再继续存在的理由了。这些消息不能不引起人们的不安。我们希望英国政府考虑到老挝的严重局势将信守它对日内瓦协议应负的庄严责任，对苏联政府的照会尽速作出肯定的答复。
    最近，由于美国嗾使老挝当局进行了一系列背弃日内瓦协议的活动，老挝局势正日益严重化。老挝当局在声明将不再受日内瓦协议的约束以后，竟公然宣布从3月20日起禁止从西贡到河内的越南国际监察和监督委员会的飞机在老挝作中途降落。与此同时，老挝当局力图掩饰其违背日内瓦协议，大肆迫害前寮国战斗部队人员，并允许大批的美国武器和弹药入境，接受美国军事人员、设立军事基地等等事实。据老挝“爱国报”在2月28日严正指出，前寮国战斗部队人员正在遭受严重的迫害，老挝的和平受到威胁。甚至连美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者戈登·沃克也透露，前寮国战斗部队人员“将无尽期地被拘留在……相当于一个集中营的地方”。不仅如此，美帝国主义利用它对老挝的日益深入的控制，还加紧策动老挝亲美势力积极向越南民主共和国挑衅，并勾结在老挝的残余蒋军侵犯我国的边境地区。美国的目的是彻底破坏日内瓦协议，控制印度支那的和平中立国家、以便扩大对印度支那的侵略，在东南亚制造新的紧张局势，美国的这一阴谋早已不是什么秘密了。就在3月9日“纽约时报”的社论便公开鼓吹说：美国现在“可以训练老挝二万五千名陆军，而老挝也可以自由参加东南亚条约组织”了。所有这些事实都表明，老挝“爱国报”提出的为了维护印度支那和平，为了维护日内瓦协议，迅速召集老挝国际委员会，继续行使其职责的要求，是完全符合于印度支那和平的利益的，应该得到所有日内瓦会议参与国的同情和支持。
    这里应该提到，老挝国际委员会主席印度所表现的态度是值得欢迎的。印度总统普拉沙德在3月9日指出：“国际委员会的委员们彼此将充分地合作，并且取得老挝政府的合作以维护和平”。印度外交部副部长梅农夫人在3月11日也指出，印度政府“正在努力使老挝国际监察和监督委员会”根据（日内瓦会议的）两位主席最近致印度政府的信中所表示的意见，“处理同关于在老挝停止敌对行动的日内瓦协定有关的问题”。过去一个时期，印度政府曾经为了维护日内瓦协议而作出了重大的贡献，我们相信印度政府在这个重要的时刻将继续为印度支那的和平作出进一步的贡献。
    作为日内瓦协议的签字国和老挝的毗邻的中国人民，对印度支那的和平特别关切，这是理所当然的。最近万象电台竟把中国人民对于维护日内瓦协议所作的努力歪曲为对老挝内政的“干涉”，这不能不引起中国人民的愤慨。中国人民在对外关系上一向坚持睦邻政策与和平共处的五项原则。中国人民真诚希望与包括老挝在内的所有邻国保持与发展和平与友好的睦邻关系；但是我们绝对不能容许美国破坏日内瓦协议的实施和实现其扩大侵略的阴谋。正是出于这一立场，中国人民坚决要求日内瓦协议在老挝必须得到彻底的实施，中国人民坚决反对老挝当局在美国的指使下继续背弃日内瓦协议威胁印度支那和平的行动。这不仅同中国人民有直接的利害关系，也是我们对日内瓦协议的庄严责任。
