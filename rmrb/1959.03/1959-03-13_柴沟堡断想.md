Reflections on Chaigoubao
　　Xue Shan

　　I came to Chaigoubao with the swirling, dancing auspicious snow.

　　The beautiful Yang River lies at the foot of the low mountains. Dressed in plain attire, it extends its pure white hands, tightly embracing Chaigoubao. These days there is no sandstorm, and upon getting off the train, one can see the blast furnaces of the steel plant emitting white smoke. The weather is so warm, as if intentionally welcoming people to visit Chaigoubao.

　　Half of the city wall of Chaigoubao has been demolished, just like other cities along the Beijing-Baotou Railway Line. These cities, which were once ancient post stations and military fortresses, had their brick walls torn down when tall buildings were constructed. Especially last year, during the nationwide steelmaking campaign, the bricks were all used as special materials for building furnaces. Those square bricks that were once used by the ruling class to build castles and suppress the people have finally found their best use.

　　Chaigoubao now belongs to Huai'an County. In just three or four months, the original Huai'an county seat has been transformed into a residential point of the "Guangming People's Commune." Wanquan County has been abolished, and its county seat has also been transformed into a residential point of the "Chengguan People's Commune." The ten communes of Huai'an all have residential points. There are countless cities in the countryside, and lovely villages in the cities, which makes it easier for tractors to cultivate the vast land. Chaigoubao is also a residential point, but its development will be greater in the future, and it will become the center of Huai'an. In this way, the Beijing-Baotou Railway, like a green ribbon, winds around the entire territory of Huai'an. Tall trees will be planted on both sides of the railway, and the closely connected garden area will have boundless apple trees and crabapple trees growing. What a beautiful vision that is!

　　Chaigoubao is a square city, with a crossroads in the very center, and four paifang (memorial archways) erected in all directions. The location of the People's Commune Committee in the north, with its overlapping eaves and strange architectural style, is probably originally an ancient temple; there is nothing more antique than this. However, groups of young men and women are accumulating manure, and People's Liberation Army soldiers in green uniforms are also accumulating manure; loads of manure are being carried away one by one, two by two, cart by cart. This kind of enthusiasm is inconsistent with the solemn atmosphere of the building, forming a sharp contrast. The ranks of production, surging across the land in 1959, began like this in Chaigoubao!

　　When making steel last year, there was a man named Li Pu in Ganling Temple, who was already forty years old. He went up the mountain to mine, and a spark ignited the explosives. For the safety of others, he bravely embraced the explosives and walked away, eventually suffering serious injuries. Where did this living Dong Cunrui, this strength, come from? Before liberation, people had to flee famine every year. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the commune proposed planting apple trees. Some old farmers in Tao'ergou had never tasted an apple in their lives and did not know what kind of sweetness it was. So the commune bought some for them to taste. One of them ate and laughed heartily, tears streaming from his eyes. So people put in a lot of effort, and that place became a flower and fruit gully. I also personally met Zhong Shiju, a model manure accumulator, in the county committee. He is from Dongshawu, and although he is already sixty years old, he is still so diligently collecting manure. His family has five generations living under one roof, and all of them, big and small, are excellent. Some are militiamen, some are factory directors, and some are breeders… their strength has been brought into play in this way, endlessly. What does this illustrate?

　　Chaigoubao, as a command platform, holds high the fluttering red flag. Thanks to the efforts of the people of Chaigoubao and the entire county, a "Marshal County" award flag issued by the provincial committee hangs on the wall of the county committee's conference hall. Facing such an unforgettable sight, and looking at the snowflakes dancing madly with smiles, as a guest, I naturally want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Chaigoubao: Raise the red flag even higher!

    柴沟堡断想
    薛汕
    我随着纷纷飞舞的瑞雪来到了柴沟堡。
    美丽的洋河，躺在低矮的群山脚下。它穿着素装，伸开洁白的双手，紧紧地抱着柴沟堡。这几天没有风沙，一下车就可以见到炼铁厂的高炉吐着白烟。天气那么暖和，仿佛有意欢迎人们到柴沟堡来作客一样。
    柴沟堡的城墙拆去了一半，像京包线沿线其他各个城市一样：这些曾经是古代驿站、军事堡子的城池，在兴建起高大的楼房的时候，城墙的砖头被拆掉了。特别是去年全民炼钢的时候，都做了砌炉子的特殊材料。那些曾经被统治阶级用来砌城堡镇压人民的方砖，如今终于找到它最好的用途。
    柴沟堡已成为怀安县的了。仅仅是三、四个月的光景，原来的怀安县城已改为“光明人民公社”的居民点；万全县撤销了，县城也改为“城关人民公社”的居民点。怀安十个公社都有居民点，乡村中有无数的城市，城市里又有着可爱的乡村，使广阔的土地上，更便于拖拉机的耕种。柴沟堡也是一个居民点，不过将来它的发展来得大些，将要成为怀安的中心。这样，京包线像一条绿色的披带绕过怀安全境，铁路两旁栽上高大的乔木，紧紧挨着的园林地带，将有一望无际的苹果树、沙果树成长起来。这远景，是多么美丽啊！
    柴沟堡是四四方方一座城，最中间是十字街头，四个牌楼竖立在四方。靠北的人民公社委员会所在地，重重叠叠的屋檐、奇异的建筑形式，恐怕原本就是古庙吧，再没有比这更古香古色了。但是一群群的青年男女正在积肥，穿着绿色衣服的解放军也正在积肥；粪疙瘩一挑挑、一驮驮、一车车的运走。这样一股热劲儿，跟建筑物那种静穆的气氛却不协调，形成了鲜明对照。1959年在大地上翻卷起的生产的行列，在柴沟堡，就是这样开头的啊！
    去年炼铁的时候，在甘岭寺有一个叫李朴的，已四十岁了，上山采矿，火花碰燃了炸药，他为了别人的安全，奋不顾身的抱着炸药走开，终于受到重伤。这位活着的董存瑞，这股力量究竟是怎么来的？解放前每年都要往外逃荒；去年大跃进的日子里，社里提出种苹果树，桃儿沟的有些老农终生没有尝过苹果，不知是怎么一个甜头。于是社里买了一些让他们尝了，有一个边吃边哈哈大笑，眼眶淌出了泪水。于是人们一鼓足劲，那儿就变成花果沟了。我又亲自在县委会，遇见了积肥模范钟世举：他是东沙洼人，年已花甲，却仍然那么勤恳地掏粪。他一家五代同堂，大大小小都是好样的，有的是民兵，有的当厂长，也有的当饲养员……，他们的力量就这样的发挥出来了，无穷无尽的。这说明什么问题呢？
    柴沟堡作为一个司令台，高举着翻飞的红旗。由于柴沟堡和全县人们的努力，在县委的会议厅的墙上，悬挂着省委发给的“元帅县”的奖旗。我面对着这么一个难忘的景象，瞧瞧含笑飞舞得发狂了的雪花，作为一个客人，很自然地要向柴沟堡致衷心的祝贺：把红旗举得更高吧！
