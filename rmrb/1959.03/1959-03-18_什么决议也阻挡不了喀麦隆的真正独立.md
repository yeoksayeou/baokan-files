No Resolution Can Stop Cameroon's Genuine Independence
    Ke Yuelin
    The 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of Western colonial countries, passed the so-called "independence" proposal for French Cameroon put forward by the United States and other countries on March 13. Although this proposal ostensibly agrees to end the trusteeship of French Cameroon on January 1, 1960, it does not stipulate the necessary conditions to guarantee Cameroon's genuine independence, such as the withdrawal of French colonial troops from French Cameroon and the holding of elections before the end of the trusteeship; at the same time, it completely ignores the legitimate desire of the Cameroonian people to unite the two trusteeship territories.
    The United Nations General Assembly and the Trusteeship Council have held many discussions on the issue of Cameroon's independence, but due to the deliberate obstruction of colonial countries such as the United States, France, and Britain, the issue of Cameroon's independence and unification has not been reasonably resolved. In recent years, due to the vigorous rise of the national liberation movement in Africa and the increasing armed struggle of the Cameroonian people against the French colonialists, the colonialists have been forced to verbally agree to end the trusteeship of Cameroon in 1960. However, the French and British colonialists are unwilling to give up their colonial interests in Cameroon. On the one hand, they talk glibly about giving the Cameroonian people false "independence," and on the other hand, they intensify their armed suppression of the Cameroonian people, and attempt to incorporate Cameroon into the "French Community" and British Nigeria through the local governments and parliaments they have fostered, creating a situation in which Cameroon will be permanently divided and continue to suffer enslavement. This is why the American proposal on resolving the Cameroon issue is essentially a thorough-going colonialist proposal, and only benefits the French and British colonialists in continuing to maintain their colonial rule over Cameroon under the guise of so-called "independence."
    The attitude of the United States toward the Cameroon issue in the United Nations has once again stripped off its so-called "anti-colonialism" mask, and once again revealed its colonialist hideousness. The American colonialists have consistently supported the British and French colonialists' bloody suppression of the Cameroonian people and opposed Cameroon's independence. Everyone knows that the modern weapons used by the French colonial army to massacre Cameroonian patriots are supplied by the United States in a continuous stream. The United Nations investigation team headed by the United States visited Cameroon twice in 1955 and 1958; however, this investigation team tried its best to distort the true situation in Cameroon, ignoring the Cameroonian people's desire to oppose colonial rule and demand independence. The American representative even expressed "respect" to the French colonial authorities, whose hands were stained with the blood of the Cameroonian people. The "New York Times," mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, shamelessly described the situation in Cameroon as demonstrating "France's enlightened colonial policy." This time, the United States, on the one hand, had to pretend to "support" Cameroon's independence at the United Nations General Assembly, and on the other hand, resolutely opposed the Cameroonian people holding a plebiscite and democratic elections, which is nothing more than a new trick played by American colonialists on the Cameroon issue. According to Western news agencies, the United States has reached a secret understanding with Britain and France: the United States supports the colonialist positions of Britain and France on the Cameroon issue, and Britain and France allow the United States to enjoy "preferential rights" in Cameroon economically. According to Rome's "National Evening News," quoting authoritative sources from Addis Ababa, Owen, Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of Defense, recently held "secret talks" with Beller, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs of French Cameroon. The content of the talks was said to be for the Cameroonian government to "establish positive political and economic relations with the United States" after gaining independence. Owen also hinted that the US government opposed Cameroon relying on France. The matter is very clear: the United States, on the condition of maintaining the colonial interests of Britain, France, and other countries, is actively trying to break into these countries' spheres of influence in Africa, and is trying its best to squeeze out their colonial forces in order to establish direct American rule over African colonies. The Cameroon People's Union recently issued a statement sternly pointing out the threat of American neo-colonialism, and revealing that: "The United States insists on carrying out various conspiracies that are detrimental to the interests of our people, and wants to squeeze out the control of French and British colonialists in our country in order to replace them."
    The fact is obvious that whether or not to agree that the Cameroonian people have the right to demand the complete withdrawal of colonial troops and hold democratic elections before the end of colonial rule is a clear demarcation between colonialism and anti-colonialism. The current legislative assembly of French Cameroon was elected under the threat of French colonial bayonets and does not represent the will of the Cameroonian people; and the nationalist organization, the Cameroon People's Union, which truly represents the aspirations of the Cameroonian people, is still declared illegal. Therefore, when the French colonial army is still wantonly slaughtering people in Cameroon, and when the democratic rights of the Cameroonian people are not guaranteed in the slightest, the colonialist countries such as the United States are talking at the United Nations about the "independence" and "freedom" of the Cameroonian people, which cannot but be another mockery of the United Nations Charter. During the discussion of the Cameroon issue at this United Nations General Assembly, representatives of many people's organizations and political parties in Cameroon expressed the strong desire of the Cameroonian people for genuine independence and unification. Eight independent African countries also put forward fair proposals for resolving the Cameroon issue. Unfortunately, in the United Nations organization, the Cameroonian people themselves and the African countries have no rights at all, while colonial countries such as the United States have the right to decide the fate of the Cameroonian people. The United Nations under the manipulation of the United States has added another disgraceful record to its history.
    However, it is not the colonial countries such as the United States that truly determine the fate of Cameroon, but the Cameroonian people themselves. How can a paper proposal of the American colonialists passed by the United Nations General Assembly hinder the Cameroonian people from moving towards genuine independence and freedom! As the Cameroon People's Union pointed out not long ago: "Our people have been fighting hard for many years. At present, we are more united and stronger than ever before. We will never accept French and British colonial rule or any neo-colonialist rule, no matter which country it comes from."

    什么决议也阻挡不了喀麦隆的真正独立
    柯月霖
    联合国大会第十三届会议3月13日在西方殖民国家的操纵下通过了美国等国提出的所谓法属喀麦隆“独立”的提案。这个提案虽然表面上同意法属喀麦隆在1960年1月1日结束托管，但却没有规定法国殖民军队从法属喀麦隆撤出和在托管结束前举行选举等保证喀麦隆真正独立的必不可少的条件；同时，它也完全忽视了喀麦隆人民要求两个托管区统一起来的合理愿望。
    历届联合国大会和托管理事会对喀麦隆的独立问题曾经进行过多次讨论，只是由于美、法、英等殖民国家的蓄意阻挠，喀麦隆的独立和统一问题一直没有得到合理的解决。近几年来，由于非洲的民族解放运动蓬勃高涨，喀麦隆人民反对法国殖民者的武装斗争日益扩大，迫使殖民主义者不得不在口头上同意1960年结束对喀麦隆的托管。但是，法英殖民者不甘心放弃它们在喀麦隆的殖民利益。它们一方面高谈给喀麦隆人民以虚假的“独立”，另一方面却加紧对喀麦隆人民进行武装镇压，并企图通过自己一手扶植起来的当地政府和议会把喀麦隆分别并入“法兰西共同体”和英属尼日利亚，造成喀麦隆永远分治和继续遭受奴役的局面。这就是为什么美国关于解决喀麦隆问题的提案实质上是一个彻头彻尾的殖民主义的提案，而只是有利于法英殖民者在所谓“独立”的幌子下继续维持它们对喀麦隆的殖民统治。
    美国在联合国对于喀麦隆问题所持的态度，又一次揭去了它的所谓“反殖民主义”的画皮，又一次露出了它的殖民主义的狰狞相。美国殖民者一贯支持英法殖民主义者对喀麦隆人民的血腥镇压，反对喀麦隆的独立。大家都知道，法国殖民军用来屠杀喀麦隆爱国者的现代化武器就是美国源源供应的。以美国为首的联合国调查团在1955年和1958年曾经两次访问过喀麦隆；但是这个调查团竭力歪曲喀麦隆存在着的真实形势，无视喀麦隆人民所表示的反对殖民统治要求独立的愿望。美国代表甚至向双手染满了喀麦隆人民鲜血的法国殖民当局表示“敬意”。美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”更恬不知耻地把喀麦隆局势说成是表现了“法国开明的殖民政策”。而这一次美国在联合国大会上一面不得不假惺惺地表示“支持”喀麦隆的独立，一面却坚决反对喀麦隆人民举行公民投票和民主选举，这不过是美国殖民主义者在喀麦隆问题上玩弄的一个新把戏。据西方通讯社透露，美国已经同英法两国达成秘密谅解：美国在喀麦隆问题上支持英法两国的殖民主义立场，英法两国则在经济上允许美国在喀麦隆享受“优惠权利”，又据罗马的“国家晚报”援引来自亚的斯亚贝巴权威人士的消息说，美国国防部助理欧文不久前同法属喀麦隆劳动和社会事务部长贝勒举行了“秘密会谈”，会谈内容据说是要喀麦隆政府在获得独立后“同美国建立积极的政治和经济关系”。欧文并暗示美国政府反对喀麦隆指靠法国。事情是再清楚不过了，原来美国以维护英法等国的殖民利益为条件，积极打进这些国家在非洲的势力范围，并竭力排挤它们的殖民势力，以便建立美国对非洲殖民地的直接统治。喀麦隆人民联盟在最近发表的声明中严正地指出了美国新殖民主义的威胁，并揭露说：“美国坚持要进行不利于我国人民利益的各种阴谋活动，并且想排挤法英殖民主义者在我国的控制以便取而代之”。
    事实很明显，是否同意喀麦隆人民有权在结束殖民统治以前要求殖民军队全部撤出去并举行民主的选举，这已是殖民主义与反殖民主义的一个鲜明的分野。法属喀麦隆目前的立法议会是在法国殖民者的刺刀威胁下选出来的，并不代表喀麦隆人民的意志；而真正代表喀麦隆人民愿望的民族主义组织喀麦隆人民联盟直到现在仍被宣布为非法。因此，当法国殖民军队还在喀麦隆境内滥施屠杀的时候，当喀麦隆人民的民主权利还得不到丝毫保障的时候，美国等殖民主义国家却在联合国讲坛上侈谈喀麦隆人民的“独立”和“自由”，这不能不是对联合国宪章的又一次嘲弄。在这次联合国大会讨论喀麦隆问题时，喀麦隆许多人民团体和政党代表都表达了喀麦隆人民要求真正独立与统一的强烈的愿望。非洲八个独立国家也提出了解决喀麦隆问题的公正的提案。但是不幸的是，在联合国组织内，喀麦隆人民自己和非洲国家竟是毫无权利的，而美国等殖民主义国家倒有权来决定喀麦隆人民的命运。在美国操纵下的联合国又在自己的历史上添了一笔不光彩的记录。
    然而，真正决定喀麦隆命运的决不是美国等殖民国家，而是喀麦隆人民自己。联合国大会通过的美国殖民者的一纸提案岂能阻挠喀麦隆人民走向真正的独立和自由！正如喀麦隆人民联盟在不久前指出的：“我国人民进行了多年的艰苦斗争。目前我们空前团结，空前壮大。我们永远不会接受法英的殖民统治或是一切新殖民主义统治，不论它来自那一个国家”。
