Strive for a Greater Leap Forward in Bast Fiber Production

This year's bast fiber production task is a magnificent task for a greater leap forward. According to the national plan, major bast fibers such as jute, ramie, hemp, and blue hemp must be increased by multiples or several times compared to last year in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. The Ten Initiatives put forward by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction require: We must do everything possible to increase the output of jute and ramie to 20 million dan in 1959. Enthusiastically responding to this initiative and striving to fulfill the state's requirements for increased bast fiber production is a glorious task for the vast numbers of cadres and masses in bast fiber growing areas throughout the country.

Why must this year's bast fiber production have a greater increase? This is because the growth rate of bast fibers is far from meeting the needs of the rapidly developing industrial and agricultural construction. The unprecedented bumper harvests of grain and cotton in 1958 and the large increase in light industry require a large number of麻袋 (ma dai) and麻布 (ma bu - bast fiber cloth) for packaging and transportation of these industrial and agricultural products. Moreover, with the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, more bast fiber industrial raw materials are needed to meet the needs of the rapid development of light industry; more bast fiber products are also needed to meet the needs of the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Whether in industrial and agricultural production and construction or in people's lives, bast fiber has great uses and is in great demand. Bast fiber is a very important raw material in the textile and paper industries; the tall scaffolding in basic construction is tied together with hemp ropes, and the construction of a building with an area of 160,000 square meters and a height of 42 meters requires about 80,000 dan of hemp. After the realization of communization in rural areas, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have developed in an all-round way, and all sectors need a large number of bast fiber products. Taking agricultural production as an example, the promotion of rope-traction machines requires at least 70 to 80 jin of hemp per machine. The leap forward in fisheries requires a large amount of ramie to manufacture fishing nets, ropes, and other fishing tools. Large-scale water conservancy and river network construction in various places, as well as many sideline productions, cannot do without bast fiber. As for the people's lives, there are even more places where bast fiber is used, which is very clear to everyone. Precisely because bast fiber has such a wide range of and such important uses, it is also a best-selling commodity in the international market. For every ton of ramie we export, we can exchange for five tons of thin steel plates; forty tons of ramie can be exchanged for a set of combined coal mining machines. This is of great help to supporting national construction. Therefore, whether it is to promote industrial and agricultural production, or to meet the needs of people's lives and export trade for bast fibers, we must strive to achieve a greater leap forward in bast fiber production.

To achieve a greater leap forward in bast fiber production this year, all localities must solve two key issues: one is to expand the planting area of bast fiber crops according to the national plan, and the other is to greatly increase the yield per unit area on the basis of the expanded bast fiber field area.

According to the national plan, the planting area of jute, ramie, hemp, and blue hemp this year should be expanded by one to two times compared to last year. All localities should, in accordance with the planting tasks assigned by the state and the needs of the communes themselves, ensure the completion of the bast fiber field area. At present, some localities have an inappropriate view on the issue of expanding bast fiber field area: they believe that the production task can be completed without expanding. Of course, the yield per unit area of bast fiber can still be greatly increased, but the total output of bast fiber in our country this year is not just an increase of a few percent, nor is it just an increase of a few tens of percent, but an increase of multiples or even several times. Therefore, there must be an appropriate expansion of the planting area in order to put the completion of the bast fiber leap forward target on a solid and reliable basis. Our country has very good natural conditions. From Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island in the south, all are suitable for the growth of bast fiber crops. Therefore, all people's communes that can grow bast fiber should plant an appropriate amount of bast fiber crops to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the lives of the vast number of commune members within the commune; the people's communes in the major bast fiber producing areas should, in accordance with the national plan, ensure the completion and over-completion of bast fiber production, and ensure the needs of national industrial and agricultural production and construction. This is a glorious political task for the vast bast fiber producing areas, and all people's communes and local Party committees must victoriously realize this glorious task. In expanding the bast fiber fields, all localities must earnestly solve the seed problem. According to investigations by relevant departments, some areas have not retained enough jute and hemp seeds this year; on the other hand, some areas have retained more. All localities should tap the potential of bast fiber seeds and give full play to the spirit of communist cooperation to support areas with insufficient bast fiber seeds with surplus seeds. Recently, Guangdong Province's various special districts and counties launched a bast fiber seed inspection to vigorously tap the potential of local bast fiber seeds. This measure is very good. If all localities across the country can do this, the difficulty of insufficient seeds can be overcome. In areas with severe seed shortages, it is necessary to improve planting and seedling protection techniques, save seeds, and also use the opportunity of thinning seedlings to transplant the excess bast fiber seedlings, or directly carry out seedling raising and transplanting. These methods are all practical and feasible measures to ensure the completion of the expanded bast fiber field plan, and all localities should vigorously promote them.

Another important key to striving for a leap forward in bast fiber production is to carry out a large-scale high-yield movement in bast fiber fields and vigorously increase the yield per unit area of bast fiber crops. The large-area high-yield typical examples in 1958 show that the potential for increasing bast fiber production is great. Last year, there were four counties in the country with a jute yield of 1,000 jin per mu, four counties with a ramie yield of 200 jin per mu, and two counties with a hemp yield of 300 jin per mu. Their average yields exceeded the national average yield by one to two times. Earnestly promoting these experiences of large-area high yield can completely enable our country's bast fiber production to achieve a greater leap forward. According to the experience of Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the country's jute production and has an average yield of 935 jin per mu, improving the water conservancy conditions of the bast fiber fields (watering two to three times), deep plowing and early planting, applying more base fertilizer, applying frequent topdressing (increasing the amount of fertilizer by 50 times compared to previous years), reasonable close planting (about 35,000 plants per mu); and vigorously preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, diligently cultivating and weeding, and truly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in every bast fiber field, the yield of bast fiber can be greatly increased. These experiences can be adopted in jute producing areas. If half of the jute fields in the country follow the example of Xiaoshan County and achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, there will be confidence in completing the overall jute production task. This year, Xiaoshan County has put forward a grand plan to achieve a yield of 1,500 jin per mu, challenging and competing with the entire province. In order to successfully realize its own leap forward plan, this county is now actively preparing fertilizers and fine seeds for the bast fiber fields, training technical backbones for bast fiber planting, and preparing a large number of sowing machines. It is hoped that all localities will do the same. With such enthusiasm and measures, there is a guarantee to ensure the bumper harvest of bast fiber.

Bast fiber crops are different from general agricultural crops. In addition to increasing production, there is also the issue of stripping and processing. With the increase in bast fiber production, the labor required for stripping bast fiber will also increase accordingly. Now we should actively prepare stripping tools, so as not to be caught off guard and cause passivity. In 1958, various localities created many bast fiber stripping tools. Now these bast fiber stripping tools should be actively evaluated, identified, and manufactured. Heilongjiang Province has decided this year to establish hemp processing plants in key areas producing hemp, and plans to vigorously promote hemp stripping machines. At present, 542 "August 1st" brand foot-operated hemp stripping machines and 206 Leap Forward brand electric hemp stripping machines have been evaluated and promoted. It is hoped that various bast fiber producing areas will also do what Heilongjiang Province is doing in promoting hemp stripping machines while planting hemp.

In order to ensure a leap forward in bast fiber production, it is hoped that Party committees at all levels in bast fiber producing areas will strengthen their leadership over bast fiber production. Key producing areas should manage bast fiber fields with the same energy as managing grain and cotton fields. One of the important reasons for the bumper harvest of bast fiber fields in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province in 1958 was that the county, district, township, and commune all had a Party committee secretary to manage cotton and bast fiber fields. This year, Hubei Province also proposed that bast fiber production should take off in high spirits together with grain, cotton, and oil, and decided that the Provincial Department of Agriculture should set up a Cotton and Bast Fiber Division. Depending on the size of the bast fiber production task, the county Party secretary, county Party committee members, and agricultural and industrial ministers will specifically lead bast fiber production. This approach is very good. The people's communes should draw out a certain amount of labor to establish specialized bast fiber planting groups (teams) to strengthen the responsibility system for bast fiber field management and manage this year's bast fiber fields well.

At present, there is less than a month before the bast fiber planting season. We should seize this crucial time to prepare a series of tasks such as fertilizers, machinery and medicines, seeds, sowing tools, as well as technical training and consolidation of bast fiber fields, improve the quality of sowing, ensure the completion of the bast fiber field area, and fire the first shot of increasing bast fiber production, and strive to ensure a leap forward in bast fiber production this year.

### 争取麻类生产更大跃进

    争取麻类生产更大跃进
    今年麻类的生产任务是一个更大跃进的宏伟任务。按照国家计划，黄洋麻、苧麻、大麻、青麻等主要麻类，必须比去年成倍或几倍的增加，才能适应工农业大跃进对麻类的需要。全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议中要求：要想尽一切办法使1959年黄洋麻和苎麻的产量达到二千万担。热烈响应这个倡议，努力完成国家对麻类增产的要求，是全国种麻地区广大干部和群众的一个光荣任务。
    为什么今年的麻类必须有一个更大的增产呢？这是因为麻类增长速度远远不能满足高速度发展着的工农业建设的需要。1958年粮食、棉花的空前大丰收，轻工业的大增产，为了包装和运输这些工农业产品，就需要大量的麻袋和麻布。而且随着工农业的大跃进，还需要更多的麻纤维工业原料，以满足轻工业高速发展的需要；也需要更多的麻制品满足农林牧副渔全面大发展的需要。无论在工农业生产建设中，无论在人民生活中，麻都有很大的用途，需要量都很大。纺织工业、造纸工业中麻是很重要的原料；基本建设中高大的脚手架，都是用麻绳捆绑搭起来的，建筑一座十六万平方公尺面积、四十二公尺高的楼房，需麻八万担左右。农村实现公社化以后，农林牧副渔五业全面发展，业业都需要大量的麻类产品。拿农业生产来讲，推广绳索牵引机，每一台最少要用麻七十至八十斤。渔业的跃进，需要大量的苎麻制造渔网、绳索等捕鱼工具。各地大兴水利、河网化，以及很多副业生产离了麻也是不行的。至于人民生活方面用麻的地方就更多，这是人人都很清楚的。正因为麻有这样广泛和这样重要的用途，因此在国际市场上麻也是一项畅销的物资，我们每出口一吨苎麻，可以换回五吨薄钢板；四十吨苎麻可换回一套康拜因采煤机。这对于支援国家建设是有很大作用的。所以，不论是为了促进工农业生产，还是为了满足人民生活和出口贸易方面对麻类的需要，都必须努力使麻类的生产有一个更大的跃进。
    要使今年麻类生产获得一个更大的跃进，各地必须解决好两个关键问题：一个是按照国家计划扩大麻类作物的种植面积，一个是在麻田面积扩大的基础上极大地提高单位面积产量。
    根据国家计划，今年黄洋麻、苎麻、大麻、青麻的种植面积，都要比去年扩大一倍到两倍。各地应当按照国家分配的植麻任务和公社本身的需要，保证完成麻田面积。现在，有个别地方在扩大麻田面积问题上存在着一种不妥当的看法：认为不扩大也能完成生产任务。当然，麻类单位面积的产量还能极大的提高，但是，我国今年的麻的总产量不是只增产百分之几，也不是只增产百分之几十，而是成倍以至几倍地增加，因此必须有播种面积适当的扩大，才能把完成麻的跃进指标放在稳妥可靠的基础上。我国的自然条件很好，北到黑龙江，南到海南岛都适合麻类作物的生长，因此，凡是能够种麻的人民公社都应该播种适当数量的麻类作物，满足公社内部工农业生产和广大社员生活中对麻类的需要；各产麻区的人民公社更要按照国家计划，保证完成和超额完成麻类的生产、保证国家工农业生产建设的需要。这是广大产麻区的一项光荣的政治任务，各人民公社和当地党委一定要胜利实现这个光荣任务。在扩大麻田当中，各地要认真解决种子问题。根据有关部门调查，今年有些地区黄麻、大麻种子留得不够；另外有些地区又留得较多，各地应发掘麻种潜力，发挥共产主义协作的精神，将多余的麻种支援麻种不足的地区。最近广东省各专、县开展了一次麻种检查工作，大力挖掘地方麻种潜力，这个措施很好，如果全国各地都能这样做，麻种不足的困难是可以克服的。在缺种严重的地区，要提高播种保苗技术，节约用种，还可以利用间苗时把多余的麻苗移栽，或直进接行育苗移栽，这些办法都是保证完成扩大麻田计划的切实可行的措施，各地应该大力提倡。
    力争麻类跃进生产另一重要关键是开展麻田大面积高额丰产运动，大力提高麻类作物的单位面积产量。1958年的大面积丰产典型说明，麻类的增产潜力是很大的。去年，全国有四个黄麻亩产千斤的县，苎麻有四个亩产二百斤县，大麻有两个三百斤县，他们的平均产量都超过了全国平均产量一倍到两倍。认真推广这些大面积高产的经验，是完全能够使我国的麻类生产获得一个更大的跃进的。根据占全国黄麻产量将近四分之一、平均亩产量达到九百三十五斤的浙江省萧山县的经验，改善麻田水利条件（浇水二至三次）、深耕早播、多施底肥、勤施追肥（施肥量比往年增加五十倍）、合理密植（每亩三万五千株左右）；并大力防治病虫害，勤中耕勤锄草，真正把“八字宪法”贯彻到每一块麻田，麻的产量就能极大提高。这些经验在黄麻产区都是可以采用的。如果全国的黄麻田有一半都向萧山县看齐，达到亩产千斤，全面完成黄麻生产任务就有把握了。今年萧山县更提出亩产一千五百斤的宏伟计划，向全省挑战竞赛。这个县为了胜利实现自己的跃进计划，现在正积极准备麻田的肥料和良种，训练植麻的技术骨干，并且准备了大量的播种器，希望各地都这样做。有了这样的干劲和措施，确保麻类的丰收才有保证。
    麻类作物与一般的农作物不同，除了增产以外，还有剥制加工的问题。随着麻产量的增加，剥麻需要的劳力也会相应地增多。现在就应该积极准备剥麻工具，以免临时措手不及，造成被动。1958年各地创造了很多剥麻工具，现在应该把这些剥麻工具积极进行评选鉴定和制造，黑龙江省已决定今年要在产大麻的重点地区，建立大麻加工厂，并计划大力推广大麻剥麻机，目前已评选推广了脚踏“八一”牌剥麻机五百四十二台，跃进牌电动剥麻机二百零六台。黑龙江省这种在种麻的同时就进行剥麻机的推广工作的作法，希望各产麻区也这样作。
    为了保证麻类跃进增产，希望麻产区各级党委加强对麻类生产的领导。重点产区要用管理粮田棉田的劲头来管理麻田。1958年浙江省萧山县的麻田丰产的重要原因之一，就是县、区、乡、社都有一个党委书记来管理棉田和麻田。今年湖北省也提出：让麻类生产与粮、棉、油比翼高飞，确定省农业厅设立棉麻处，产麻县根据麻产任务大小，由县委书记、县委委员、农工部长等专门领导麻类生产，这种做法是很好的。人民公社应该抽出一定劳力成立种麻专业组（队），以加强麻田管理的责任制，管理好今年的麻田。
    目前距离麻类播种季节，只有不到一个月的时间了，应当抓住这个紧要时机，作好肥料、药械、种子、播种工具，以及技术训练和整理麻田等一系列的准备工作，提高播种质量，保证完成麻田面积，以打响麻类增产的第一炮，力争今年麻类生产过关。
