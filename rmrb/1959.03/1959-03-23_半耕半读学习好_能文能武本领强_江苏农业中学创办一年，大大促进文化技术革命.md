Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 22nd: Jiangsu Province's agricultural middle schools have now been established for a year since they began in March last year. These schools, by adhering to the principle of half-farming and half-study and operating locally, are welcomed by the masses and satisfy the students.

In the past year, under the direct leadership of the local Party committees and with the support of the masses, agricultural middle schools throughout the province have not only greatly increased in number but also significantly improved in teaching quality. At present, the vast majority of agricultural middle schools in the province have been basically consolidated and have become an important base in the countryside for realizing the agricultural technology revolution and cultural revolution.

In March last year, after Shuanglou Township in Hai'an County and Shiqiao Township in the former Hanjiang County began to run half-farming and half-study agricultural middle schools, the Party gave them great attention and support. On March 17th, with the participation of Comrade Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee held a symposium on agricultural middle schools. The meeting pointed out the great significance of agricultural middle schools for developing education rapidly, economically, satisfactorily, and achieving agricultural technological transformation. This clarified the understanding that the development of education must adopt a "two legs walking" approach, which vigorously promoted the development of agricultural middle schools. Before mid-March, there were only two agricultural middle schools in the province; by the end of March, more than 2,000 had been established. During the summer vacation, there was further development. At the same time, development and consolidation were carried out simultaneously. In August last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial conference of teachers' representatives from agricultural middle schools to exchange experience in running schools and teaching, and put forward the slogan "Teaching surpasses regular middle schools, production rivals experienced farmers," pointing the way for the consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools. The realization of people's communes throughout the province has brought even more favorable conditions for consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools. At present, the attendance rate of students in most of the thousands of agricultural middle schools in the province remains above 90%, and many schools have reached 100%. Many schools have more suitable school buildings and have gradually added many books and teaching equipment. Agricultural middle schools in various places have established fixed labor sites, such as experimental fields, orchards, nurseries, and livestock farms. Some schools have also set up small factories, such as local fertilizer plants, local pesticide plants, and farm tool processing plants, so that teaching and labor are properly arranged, adhering to the principle of half-farming and half-study.

The establishment and development of agricultural middle schools have played a significant role in the rural cultural revolution and technical revolution. First, it promoted the development of education, ensuring that every township has a middle school, basically forming a provincial middle school network, meeting the requirements of primary school graduates for further education, thereby driving the development of primary school education. At the same time, agricultural middle schools combine half-farming and half-study, teaching combined with local production realities, which not only cultivates students' love of labor but also improves their cultural and technical knowledge. After students learn agricultural production knowledge, they can immediately apply it to practice, which vigorously promotes the development of agricultural production. The experimental fields of some agricultural middle schools have now become demonstration gardens for townships and communes to promote new technologies. The masses praised the agricultural middle schools, saying:
	"Agricultural middle school students are students in school, fighters in production, technicians in promoting advanced experience, and propagandists in various political movements."

Practice over the past year has shown that strengthening Party leadership, conscientiously implementing the half-farming and half-study system, and improving teachers' professional level and teaching quality are important keys to consolidating, improving, and developing agricultural middle schools. To help teachers improve their teaching level, Jiangsu Province has taken measures over the past year such as higher normal colleges holding correspondence courses for agricultural middle school teachers; various districts and cities and counties using holidays to hold training courses or establishing agricultural middle school teaching guidance groups; and some places establishing teaching research groups according to townships or people's communes, organizing agricultural middle schools to link up with local regular middle schools, and exchanging teaching experience with each other.

Now, as agricultural middle schools celebrate their first anniversary, agricultural middle schools in various places are closely integrating with production to carry out celebration activities, conscientiously summarizing the experience of running schools and teaching in the past year, further consolidating and improving, so as to continue to develop in the future, advance towards the goal of "teaching surpasses regular middle schools, production rivals experienced farmers," and enable agricultural middle schools throughout the province to play a greater role in the rural cultural revolution and technical revolution.

    半耕半读学习好　能文能武本领强
    江苏农业中学创办一年，大大促进文化技术革命
    新华社南京22日电　江苏省农业中学从去年3月创办以来，已经一周年了。这种学校，由于坚持半耕半读的原则，就地办学，受到群众欢迎，也使得学生满意。
    一年以来，全省农业中学在当地党委直接领导和群众支持下，不仅在数量上有很大的发展，而且在教学质量上也有显著的提高。现在，全省绝大多数农业中学已经基本巩固，成为农村中实现农业技术革命和文化革命的一个重要基地。
    去年3月，海安县双楼乡和原邗江县施桥乡开始办起了半耕半读的农业中学后，党便给以很大的重视和支持。3月17日，在中共中央政治局候补委员、中央宣传部长陆定一同志参加下，中共江苏省委举行了关于农业中学的座谈会。这次会议，指出农业中学对多快好省地发展教育事业和实现农业技术改造的重大意义，使许多人对教育事业的发展必须实行两条腿走路有了明确的认识，有力地推动了农业中学的发展。在3月中旬以前，全省还只有两所农业中学，到3月底就办起了二千多所。到暑假期间，又有了进一步的发展。同时，一边发展一边巩固。去年8月，中共江苏省委和江苏省人民委员会召开全省农业中学教师代表会，交流办校的经验和进行教学的经验，并且提出“教学超普中，生产赛老农”的口号，为农业中学的巩固和提高指出了方向。全省实现人民公社化，为巩固和提高农业中学带来了更加有利的条件。目前，全省数千所农业中学大多数学校学生的出席率保持在90％以上，不少学校达到百分之百。许多学校有了比较适合的校舍，逐步添置了不少图书和教学设备。各地农业中学都设立了固定的劳动场所，如试验田、果园、林圃、畜牧场等。有些学校还开办了小型工厂，如土化肥厂、土农药厂、农具加工厂等，使教学与劳动得到了妥善的安排，坚持了半耕半读的原则。
    农业中学的创办和发展，在农村文化革命、技术革命中发挥了很大作用。首先是促进了教育事业的发展，做到乡乡有中学，基本上形成了全省的中学网，满足了高小毕业生升学的要求，从而带动了小学教育的发展。同时，农业中学半耕半读，教学结合当地生产实际，既养成了学生爱劳动的习惯，又提高了学生的文化技术知识，学生在学到农业生产知识以后，马上可以运用到实际中去，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。有些农业中学的试验田，现在都成了乡社推广新技术的示范园地，群众赞扬农业中学说：
  “农业中学学生，在学校里是学员，在生产中是战斗员，在推广先进经验中是技术员，在各项政治运动中又是宣传员。”
    一年来的实践说明，加强党的领导，认真贯彻半耕半读制度，提高教师业务水平和教学质量，是巩固提高和发展农业中学的重要关键。为了帮助教师提高教学水平，一年来江苏省采取了高等师范学院为农业中学教师举办函授班；各专区和市县利用假期举办了训练班或成立了农业中学教学辅导团；有的地方还按乡或人民公社成立了教学研究小组，组织农业中学与当地的普通中学挂钩，互相交流教学经验。
    现在，当农业中学创办一周年的时候，各地农业中学正在紧密结合生产，开展庆祝活动，认真地总结过去一年来的办学和教学的经验，进一步巩固提高，以便今后继续发展，向“教学超普中，生产赛老农”的目标前进，使全省农业中学在农村文化革命、技术革命中起到更大的作用。
