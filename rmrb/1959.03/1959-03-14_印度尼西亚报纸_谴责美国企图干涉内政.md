Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 12th - The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper today published a dispatch from the Associated Press, pointing out that, according to this dispatch, the United States had twice planned to send troops to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs when Indonesian rebels were rampant.

The AP dispatch stated that in November and December of 1957, the U.S. Marine Corps Task Force Third Division, aboard Seventh Fleet warships, advanced southward "to prepare for all eventualities." This group of troops advanced southward again in April 1958 when "disturbances" occurred in Indonesia.

The newspaper pointed out that the end of 1957 was precisely when rebel leader, former Deputy Army Chief of Staff Lubis, and other rebels were carrying out large-scale divisive activities. April 1958 was precisely when the so-called "Revolutionary Government" was in open rebellion, and government forces were suppressing them.

"Indonesia Torch" said that it can be seen from this dispatch that the United States military was twice preparing to interfere in Indonesian internal affairs.

    谴责美国企图干涉内政
    新华社雅加达12日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天刊载了美联社的一条电讯，并且指出，根据这条电讯，当印度尼西亚叛乱分子猖獗的时候，美国曾经两度打算派遣军队干涉印度尼西亚的内政。
    美联社的这条电讯说，在1957年11月和12月期间，美国海军陆战队特遣队第三师乘了第七舰队的兵舰向南挺进“准备应付各种可能性”。这批军队在1958年4月当印度尼西亚发生“骚动”时，再度向南挺进。
    报纸指出，1957年年底正是叛军领袖前陆军副参谋长卢比斯和叛乱分子进行大规模分裂活动的时候。1958年4月正是所谓“革命政府”进行公开叛乱，而政府军对它们进行镇压的时候。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，可以从这篇电讯中看出，美国军队曾经两度准备干涉印度尼西亚内政。
