Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 12th: Iraqi public opinion strongly condemns imperialism and foreign interference forces for creating rebellion in Iraq.

The Iraqi Republic Radio station, on March 10th, issued a commentary pointing out that the imperialist conspiracy recently carried out by the traitor Shawwaf shows that imperialists and all reactionary ambitious elements have not ceased planning and strengthening their conspiracy of aggression.

The radio station said: "Since the beginning of the Iraqi revolution, imperialists, Zionists, and reactionaries from Iraq and other Arab countries have risen up to carry out sinister conspiracies. Leader Qassem has announced more than once that Iraq possesses documents and recordings related to these conspiracies, but he ordered that these things not be announced in order to maintain Arab unity."

The radio station said that the conspiracy of December 9, 1958, already showed that this group, composed of American and British imperialists, ambitious elements, and conspirators, had begun to collude and were prepared to collude with traitors in an attempt to overthrow the democratic regime in Iraq. They put forward deceptive slogans in the name of nationalism and unification, constantly plotting conspiracies, issuing statements, and openly saying that the realization of the Iraqi revolution should be attributed to them. These ambitious forces wanted to extract from Iraq the price they had paid for supporting it, to impose a certain political form on Iraq, and to impose certain relationships and connections that only the Iraqi people could decide.

The radio station emphasized: "The Iraqi people deeply understand the true meaning of Arab unity. They despise the kind of false unity that allows interference in their internal affairs and that is conditional on depriving the people of their right to self-determination, and they despise the kind of false unity that uses conspiracy and subversion, relying on lies, slander, and deception." The radio station said that true unity is the unity of friendly peoples and countries, jointly implementing a policy of opposing world imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries, refusing to compromise and bargain with imperialism, implementing a policy of strengthening the independence of all liberated Arab countries and supporting the peoples of all Arab countries who are fighting to seize freedom and independence from imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries.

Many newspapers in Baghdad, including "Revolution News," "News Report," and "People's Solidarity News," have accused the UAR authorities regarding Shawwaf's rebellion.

The liaison committee of various professional trade unions and cultural associations also sent a telegram to UAR President Nasser, condemning the UAR for "openly inciting those traitorous elements who are conspiring to undermine the structure of our democratic republic." "These actions violate the spirit of fraternal friendship and good neighborliness, and are a stab in the back of Arab nationalism."

In the parades and demonstrations held in Baghdad for several days, the people unanimously expressed their support for the Qassem government in resolutely suppressing the rebels, and angrily condemned foreign conspiratorial interference.

The Middle East News Agency also summarized the reasons for Shawwaf's rebel army to carry out a "revolution" based on Shawwaf's "communiqué," including: the Iraqi government "abandoned Arab unity," "betrayed the July 14th Revolution and its principles and objectives," "removed revolutionary ministers and deprived the Supreme Power Committee of its power," and "excluded members of the Revolutionary Committee in order to allow frivolous opportunists to replace them," and so on.

Cairo Radio and Damascus Radio also rebroadcasted a large amount of these messages from "Mosul Radio".

Some newspapers in Damascus openly expressed support for the Shawwaf rebellion. "Victory News" headlined: "The Iraqi coup is to restore the purpose of the July 14th Revolution." "Today's News" called the Mosul rebellion "the Iraqi Revolution."

    伊拉克舆论就沙瓦夫叛国事件发表评论
    谴责帝国主义和外国势力制造叛乱

    新华社巴格达12日电　伊拉克舆论强烈谴责帝国主义和外国干涉势力在伊拉克制造叛乱。
    伊拉克共和国电台10日发表评论指出，叛徒沙瓦夫最近执行的帝国主义阴谋表明，帝国主义分子和一切反动野心家并没有停止策划和加强阴谋侵略计划。
    电台说：“自从伊拉克革命之初，帝国主义、犹太复国主义以及伊拉克和其它阿拉伯国家的反动派就已群起进行险恶的阴谋。领袖卡塞姆曾经不止一次地宣布说伊拉克拥有有关这些阴谋的文件和录音，但是他命令不要宣布这些东西，为的是维护阿拉伯团结。”
    电台说，1958年12月9日的阴谋就已表明，这些由美英帝国主义者和野心家、阴谋者组成的集团已开始合谋，准备同卖国贼勾结起来，力图推翻伊拉克民主政权。他们假借民族主义和统一的名义提出迷惑性的口号，不时策划阴谋，发表声明，公然说伊拉克革命的实现应归功于他们。这些野心势力想要从伊拉克讨取他们曾经支持它的代价，要把某种政治形式强加于伊拉克，要强加某些只有伊拉克人民才能决定的关系和联系。
    电台强调说：“伊拉克人民深深懂得阿拉伯团结的真实意义。他们蔑视那种允许干涉他们内政和那种以剥夺人民自决权为条件的虚伪团结，蔑视那种使用阴谋和颠覆，依靠撒谎、诽谤和迷惑的虚伪团结。”电台说，真正的团结是友爱的各国人民和国家团结起来，共同执行反对世界帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派，拒绝同帝国主义妥协和讨价还价的方针，执行加强各个解放了的阿拉伯国家的独立并且支持为从帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派手中夺取自由和独立而斗争的各国阿拉伯人民的方针。
    巴格达的许多报纸，包括“革命报”、“消息报”、“人民团结报”等，都就沙瓦夫的叛乱对阿联当局提出了指责。
    各专业工会和文化协会联络委员会并打电报给阿联总统纳赛尔，谴责阿联“公开煽动那些阴谋破坏我们的民主共和国结构的叛国分子”。“这些行动违背了兄弟之情和睦邻的精神，是对阿拉伯民族主义当胸一刀。”
    巴格达人民在连日举行的游行示威中一致表示支持卡塞姆政府坚决镇压叛乱分子，并且愤怒地谴责外国的阴谋干涉者。
    中东通讯社还根据沙瓦夫的“公报”归纳了沙瓦夫叛军进行“革命”的原因，其中有：伊拉克政府“背弃阿拉伯统一”、“背叛7月14日革命以及其原则和目的”、“罢免革命部长并剥夺最高权力委员会的权力”、“排斥革命委员会的委员以便让轻率的机会主义分子取而代之”等等。
    开罗电台和大马士革电台也大量转播了“摩苏尔电台”这些消息。
    大马士革的一些报纸对沙瓦夫叛乱公开表示支持。“胜利报”大字标出：“伊拉克政变是要恢复7月14日革命的目的”。“今天报”把摩苏尔叛乱称之为“伊拉克革命”。
