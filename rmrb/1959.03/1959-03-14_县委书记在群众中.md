    The County Party Secretary Among the Masses
    By our reporter Li Qinyuan
    Li Xueliang, the County Party Secretary of the CCP Hunan Ningxiang County Committee, often labors alongside the commune members. Aside from meeting times, it's difficult to find him in the county committee office. He often goes barefoot, carrying a load of wicker baskets, and holding a manure hoe, gathering wild fertilizer in the fields and mountains. Last year, he, along with technical cadres and farmers, established a multi-crop management experimental field of 34 mu. This year, he continues to cultivate the experimental fields, participating in everything from leveling the land to accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing, and always taking the lead.

    One evening in mid-February this year, he arrived at the Tian'e Production Team. The next day, snowflakes filled the sky, and the north wind howled, the water in the fields was bone-chillingly cold. Even in such weather, he got up early, leading two or three cadres to the fields to transport fertilizer and spread manure. Production Team Leader Wang Dechang got up early and thought it strange: yesterday it was cold, and everyone was told to accumulate fertilizer at home, how is it that someone is sending fertilizer to the fields so early? He went to take a look. Before he went far, he saw that it was Comrade Li Xueliang who was transporting fertilizer. He felt embarrassed and didn't go any further, returning to quickly notify the members of his team to go to work to transport fertilizer. When the members heard that Secretary Li was braving the snow to spread manure, a surge of enthusiasm quickly arose, and they rushed to the fields with their production tools. On this day, all the members of the Tian'e Production Team were mobilized, and poor peasant member Wang Ruozong ran over to help Secretary Li carry the load, but the members advised him to wash his feet and rest. Seeing that his clothes were wet, they scrambled to give him a raincoat, but Comrade Li Xueliang said to the members, "Some of you are older than me and are still working so energetically. How can I not work?" "If you give me the raincoat, you will catch a cold and get sick, I'll be fine." The members were deeply moved by him, and though they didn't say it, they secretly cheered themselves on. Female member Yi Shufen carried fertilizer with a double load, and when people asked her why, she said, "Secretary Li is older than me, yet he carries such a heavy load. I am young and strong. I should carry two loads."

    While transporting fertilizer, Comrade Li Xueliang saw that the ditches of some green manure fields were not cleared well. The green manure was flooded, and during a break, he said to the members, "Is it okay for the green manure to be flooded?" The members said, "No," "What do we do if it's not okay?" "Then let's start clearing the ditches!" In a moment, more than forty members were organized to clear the ditches. That day, they cleared more than two hundred mu. After a day of intense work, Comrade Li Xueliang finished work with the members. However, he did not return to the team's office, but went to the public canteen to have a heart-to-heart talk. Comrade Li Xueliang said to me that cadres taking the lead in production is the first step in following the mass line well. As long as the cadres take the lead, the masses will follow. We have so many cadres, if everyone takes the lead in production, wouldn't we mobilize the masses? Cadres participating in production can also change their work style and further strengthen ties with the commune members. It can also allow us to discover and solve problems in production, so why not do it?

    县委书记在群众中
    本报记者　李沁源
    中共湖南宁乡县委书记李学良同志经常和社员一起劳动。除了开会的时间，在县委会里是很难找到他的。他经常赤着脚，担着一担箢箕，手拿一把粪锄，在田间山野拾野粪。去年，他同技术干部、农民一道搞了三十四亩田土的多种经营试验场。今年，继续种试验田，从平整土地到积肥、深耕。他都样样参加，并且总是走在前面。
    今年2月中旬的一天晚上，他来到了天鹅生产队。第二天，天空飘着白雪，朔风凛冽，田里的水冷得刺骨。就是在这样的天气，他一早爬起来，带领两、三个干部。下田运肥撒粪去了。生产队长王德长清早起来，觉得奇怪：昨天天冷，叫大家在家里积肥，怎么一大早又有人向田里送肥去了呢？他走去看看。没走多远，就看出了是李学良同志在运肥。他觉得不好意思，没有再向前走，回去赶快通知自己小队的社员出工运肥。社员们一听说李书记，还冒雪下水撒粪，一股热劲飞快起来了，忙着拿起生产工具就跑向田间。这一天，天鹅生产队全队的社员都出动了，贫农社员王若宗跑来要帮李书记担，社员们劝他去洗脚休息。看到他衣服淋湿了，争着把蓑衣给他披，可是，李学良同志却对社员说：“你们中间有比我年纪大的还干得这样起劲。我怎么干不得。”“你把蓑衣给我披了。你自己会受寒得病的，我不要紧。”社员们被他深深感动了，嘴里不说，心里却暗暗地鼓劲。女社员易淑芬运肥挑双担，人家问她为什么，她说：“李书记比我年纪大，还这样大一担的挑。我年轻有力。应该挑两担。”
    在运肥中，李学良同志看到一些绿肥田的沟没有清好。绿肥被水浸了，趁休息的时候，他向社员说：“绿肥被水浸了行不行？”社员们说：“不行”，“不行怎么办？”“那我们就动手清沟吧！”一会儿，组织了四十多个社员清沟。那一天，足足清了二百多亩。紧张战斗了一天，李学良同志同社员一道收工了。不过，他没有回到队上的办公室，而到公共食堂谈心去了。李学良同志对我说，干部带头参加生产是走好群众路线的第一步。只要干部带头，群众就会跟着干的。我们有这样多的干部，大家都去带头生产，不就把群众带动起来了吗？干部参加生产，也能够改变作风，进一步密切同社员群众的联系。还能从生产中发现问题、解决问题，这又何乐而不为呢？
