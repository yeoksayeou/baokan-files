Editor's Note

    Everyone Is Their Own Master
    The people's communes in various parts of Guangdong Province have undergone rectification work, further establishing a conscious attitude towards labor among the commune members, which is worth emphasizing. The reason our country has achieved such an astonishing leap forward is that this conscious attitude towards labor is an extremely important factor.
    The masses' ability to have a conscious attitude towards labor depends first and foremost on the nature of our country (which foreign and domestic reactionaries will never understand); but it cannot be ignored that to achieve this, work needs to be done in all aspects. The establishment of a contract responsibility system at all levels of the Guangdong communes is one of the methods to reflect the conscious labor of the masses.

    人人当家作主
    广东省各地人民公社经过整社工作，使社员们进一步树立了自觉的劳动态度，这是值得大书特书的。我们国家之所以获得如此惊人的跃进，这种自觉的劳动态度是极其重要的因素。
    群众能有自觉的劳动态度，这首先取决于我们国家的性质（这一点国内外反动派是永远不能理解的）；但也不能忽视，要做到这一步，需要进行各方面的工作。广东各公社层层建立包干责任制，就是体现群众自觉劳动的办法之一。
