To meet the needs of a greater leap forward in agricultural production and to further improve the management of people's communes, Party committees at and above the county level in Zhejiang Province have sent a large number of core personnel to strengthen the grassroots leadership of people's communes. According to incomplete statistics from the Ningbo Prefectural Party Committee, Ningbo City and Shangyu, Shengxian, Yuyao, Shaoxing, and Cixi counties alone have sent down 227 leading cadres, including 24 at the level of deputy secretary of the county Party committee and heads of county Party committee departments. In addition, 82 cadres have been sent down for labor training, and 298 have undergone short-term labor for one month. At the same time, these counties and cities have also sent 2,953 government cadres to go deep into the production teams to work and labor alongside them.

After these cadres went down to the grassroots level, they closely linked with the masses and worked and labored on the production front, winning the trust and love of the broad masses of commune members. For example, Hu Chen, head of the Industry Section of the Wuxing County People's Committee, ate, lived, and labored with commune members in the Sihe Management Area of the Xingshan Commune. The masses praised him, saying, "Comrade Hu Chen is truly good, he takes the lead in all aspects of production!" The commune leadership also praised him at a telephone conference. Some counties transferred county heads to concurrently serve in grassroots work. Because they labored diligently and closely linked with the masses, commune members composed ditties to sing their praises, saying, "The county magistrates of the Qing Dynasty cleared the way with gongs and shouts, the county officials of the Kuomintang rode horses and sat in sedan chairs, but our people's county heads wear rain capes and bamboo hats." Encouraged by the leading labor of the cadres sent down to the countryside, the broad masses of commune members are filled with greater confidence in achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

In improving their work by going deep into reality, the cadres of Xindeng Commune created and applied the "five visits" and "five participations" mass line working methods. The "five visits" are: visit old farmers to learn knowledge; visit families to discuss experiences; visit kindergartens and nurseries to focus on welfare; visit canteens to focus on daily life; and visit friends to connect hearts. The "five participations" are: cadres participate in labor to conduct experiments; participate in canteens as cooks to manage daily life; participate in nurseries and kindergartens to educate children; participate in technical revolution to create and promote advanced experiences; and participate in learning politics and culture to be vanguards. When applying these working methods, they generally visit first and then "deliver treasures," and help research and solve problems when they are discovered. As a result of carrying out work in this way, not only are problems that were difficult to solve in the past discovered and resolved, but also many advanced experiences have been summarized and exchanged, which is of great help to comprehensively improving work.

    县长当农民蓑衣笠帽
    浙江大批干部下放
    本报讯　为了适应农业生产更大跃进和进一步办好人民公社的需要，浙江省县以上各级党委下放大批骨干充实人民公社的基层领导。据宁波地委不完全的统计，仅宁波市和上虞、嵊县、余姚、绍兴、慈溪等县，就下放了二百二十七名领导骨干，其中有县委副书记、县委部长一级干部二十四人。此外还有下放劳动锻炼的干部八十二人；短期劳动一个月的二百九十八人。同时，这些县市还派出了二千九百五十三名机关干部，深入生产队，一边工作一边劳动。
    这些干部下放到基层后，由于密切联系群众，在生产战线上边劳动、边工作，获得了广大社员的信任和爱戴。如吴兴县人委工业科科长胡臣在星山公社四合管理区与社员同吃、同住、同劳动中，群众称赞他说：“胡臣同志真正好，样样生产带头搞！”公社领导在电话会议上，也表扬了他。有的县抽调县长兼基层工作后，由于他们艰苦劳动，密切联系群众，社员们就编顺口溜歌颂说：“前清的知县开锣喝道，国民党的县官骑马坐轿，人民的县长蓑衣笠帽。”在下放干部带头劳动鼓舞下，广大社员对实现今年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进更加充满了信心。
    新登公社干部在深入实际改进工作中，创造与运用了“五访”“五参”的群众路线的工作方法。五访是访老农，学知识；访家庭，谈心得；访幼儿园、托儿所，抓福利；访食堂，抓生活；访朋友、心连心。五参是干部参加劳动搞试验；参加食堂当炊事员抓生活；参加托儿所、幼儿园教养孩子；参加技术革命搞创造推广先进经验；参加学习政治文化当先锋。在运用这些工作方法的时候，一般是先访问再“送宝”，发现了问题便帮助研究解决。这样进行工作的结果，不仅使过去不易解决的问题能发现和解决了，并且总结交流了许多先进经验，对全面改进工作有很大帮助。
