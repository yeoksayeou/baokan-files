Xinhua News Agency, La Paz, 6th March: The wave of anti-American anger sparked by an insulting article about Bolivia in the American "Time" magazine spread to other Bolivian cities on March 4th.

    In Cochabamba, Bolivia's second-largest city, students demonstrated in front of the newly established US consulate on the 4th. They were unable to break into the US consulate due to police obstruction. Later, the demonstrators attacked the US Information Service office, destroying documents and other office equipment. In another city, Oruro, the US Information Service office was also attacked by angry Bolivians on the same day. The office's windows were smashed.

    It is reported that the atmosphere in the capital, La Paz, has eased after two consecutive days of demonstrations. President Siles Zuazo assured the demonstrators on the 3rd that he would "defend the nation's dignity at all costs." (Attached picture)

    The demonstrators in La Paz marched through the streets carrying American flags and models of "Time" magazine, then burned them to protest the insult to Bolivia.

    玻利维亚反美怒潮未息
    美国使馆和新闻处成为众矢之的
    新华社6日讯　拉巴斯消息：由美国“时代”杂志一篇侮辱玻利维亚的文章所引起的反美怒潮4日扩展到玻利维亚其他城市。
    在玻利维亚第二大城市哥恰邦巴，学生们4日在新设的美国领事馆前举行了示威。由于警察的阻挡，他们没能冲进美国领事馆。后来，示威者袭击了美国新闻处的办事处，捣毁了文件和其他办公用具。在另一城市奥路罗，美国新闻处的办事处也在同一天受到愤懑的玻利维亚人的袭击。办事处的窗户被捣毁。
    据报道，首都拉巴斯在接连两天举行示威游行以后，气氛已趋于缓和。西勒斯—苏阿索总统曾在3日向示威群众提出保证，要“不惜任何代价保卫祖国的民族尊严”。（附图片）
