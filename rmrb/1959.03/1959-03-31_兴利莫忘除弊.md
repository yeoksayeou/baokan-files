    When Promoting Benefits, Do Not Forget to Eliminate Drawbacks
    In many winter rapeseed fields in the South, aphids, flea beetles, leaf miners, downy mildew, Sclerotinia rot, and virus diseases have begun to occur. This is a problem that deserves serious attention in the later stages of rapeseed management.
    The winter rapeseed in the southern regions was sown last autumn. From sowing to the present, a lot of labor has been spent on this production, which has played a significant role in making the seedlings strong and producing more pods. However, the struggle to win a bumper rapeseed harvest is not over. Some areas have put forward the slogan "Wheat management does not stop until the wheat is harvested" for cultivating winter wheat, and the same should be true for rapeseed. Rapeseed has an indeterminate inflorescence, flowering and setting pods simultaneously over a considerable period. During this period, any risk will cause losses to the effort to achieve a bumper rapeseed harvest. To obtain a greater harvest of winter wheat, several "hurdles" must be overcome; rapeseed also has many "hurdles" to cross. The relatively common occurrence of pests and diseases is precisely a "hurdle" that needs to be overcome as soon as possible.
    This year's rapeseed has sufficient base fertilizer, is densely planted, and has suffered little frost damage, which are all favorable conditions for striving for a large oilseed harvest. However, favorable conditions cannot obscure unfavorable ones. The relatively serious pests and diseases of many rapeseed crops this year are closely related to abundant fertilizer, dense planting, and mild winter climate. Here, it can truly be said that "every advantage has a disadvantage."
    The favorable conditions for rapeseed production can enable this year's rapeseed to achieve a greater harvest, but if unfavorable conditions are not actively reformed, the unfavorable conditions may offset the role of the favorable conditions. To prevent unfavorable conditions from exerting their effect, favorable conditions must be fully utilized. Promoting benefits and eliminating drawbacks are the same thing here; without eliminating drawbacks, benefits cannot be promoted. We must not be satisfied with the fact that this year's rapeseed has sufficient fertilizer, dense planting, and good growth, and fail to actively take measures to prevent and control pests and diseases. Of course, to eliminate pests and diseases, we must also have confidence. Confidence must be built on a solid foundation, which is: resolutely relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses, and striving to grasp the patterns of pest and disease occurrence. Leading cadres should work with experienced farmers and technical personnel to summarize the past experiences in fighting pests and diseases, adopt a combination of indigenous and modern methods, and eliminate pests and diseases as early as possible in the initial or impending stages of their occurrence!

### 兴利莫忘除弊

    兴利莫忘除弊
    南方不少冬油菜田里，开始发生蚜虫、猿叶虫、潜叶蝇、霜霉病、菌核病和毒素病等。这是油菜后期管理中一个值得严重注意的问题。
    南方地区的冬油菜是在去年秋季播种的。由播种到目前，在这项生产上已经花费了很多劳动力，对油菜的苗壮、荚多起了很大作用。但是，争取菜籽丰收的斗争还没有完结。有些地区在培育冬小麦上提出了“小麦不收，管理不休”的口号，对油菜也应该这样。油菜是无限花序，边开花边结荚长籽，由最初开花到最后结荚有相当长的时期。在这期间，不论遇到任何风险，都会给争取油菜的丰收造成损失。为获得冬小麦的更大丰收要过几“关”；油菜也有许多“关口”要闯。目前比较普遍出现的病虫害，就正是一个需要尽快冲过去的“关口”。
    今年的油菜底肥足、种得密、冻害少，这是争取油料大丰收的有利条件。可是，在有利条件下不能忽视不利条件。今年许多油菜的病虫害比较严重，就同肥多、株密、冬季气候不冷等等有密切关系。在这里，真可以说是“有一利必有一弊”。
    油菜生产的有利条件可以使今年的油菜获得更大丰收，但是要不积极改革不利条件，不利条件就可能抵销了有利条件的作用。要使不利条件不能发挥作用，才能使有利条件充分发挥作用。兴利除弊在这里是一回事，弊不除，利就不能兴。决不可满足于今年油菜肥足、株密、生长好而不积极采取防治病虫害的措施。当然，要消除病虫害还必须有信心。信心要建立在坚实的基础上，这就是：坚决依靠群众的智慧和力量，力求掌握病虫害发生的规律。领导干部要和老农、技术人员在一起，把过去同病虫害作斗争的经验很好地加以总结，采取土洋结合的办法，及早把病虫害消灭在初发生或者将要发生的阶段！
