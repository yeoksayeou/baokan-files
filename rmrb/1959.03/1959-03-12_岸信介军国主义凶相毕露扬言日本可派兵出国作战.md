Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 10th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi blatantly declared in a Diet session on the 9th, while answering questions, that Japan's troops can be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases."

    Yesterday, during a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors, Japanese Socialist Party member Yajima Miyoshi questioned whether Japanese troops could be dispatched abroad to fight.

    In response to Yajima's question, Kishi Nobusuke actually stated that Japan could send troops abroad to fight. He evasively said, "In principle, the scope of activities of the Self-Defense Forces is limited to within Japanese territory," but if Japan is "invaded," it would have to attack enemy bases, and there would be no other way, and it could only be carried out by the Self-Defense Forces.

    Not long before this, Kishi Nobusuke had said at the same committee meeting that if U.S. military bases in Japan were "attacked," he would consider it an "invasion of Japan," and would take "joint action" with the United States.

    These remarks by Kishi Nobusuke not only blatantly reveal the latent imperialist ambitions of his clique for military expansion abroad, but also show that this reactionary clique is openly attempting to violate the provisions of the Japanese Constitution in order to drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for the United States in launching aggressive wars in Asia. According to Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, Japan must forever renounce war and the use of force, and does not recognize the right of the state to belligerency.

    At the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Councillors on the 9th, Kishi Nobusuke also distorted the interpretation of the Japanese Constitution's prohibition on Japan possessing war potential, attempting to seek a "legal" basis for the plot to arm Japan with nuclear weapons. He said, "If purely nuclear weapons appear to replace existing rifles, I don't think the Constitution prohibits (possessing) such things."

### 岸信介军国主义凶相毕露扬言日本可派兵出国作战

    岸信介军国主义凶相毕露扬言日本可派兵出国作战
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介9日在国会会议上答复质询时公然宣称，日本的军队可以派到国外去“进攻敌人的基地”。
    日本社会党议员矢嶋三义昨天在参议院预算委员会会议上，就是否能够派遣日本军队出国作战的问题进行了质询。
    岸信介在回答矢嶋提出的问题时，竟然表示日本可以派兵出国作战。他闪烁其词地说：“从原则上说，自卫队的活动范围只限于日本领土内”，但是，假如日本遭到“侵略”时，（日本）就得进攻敌人的基地，除此之外没有其他办法，而且也只能由自卫队去进行。
    在此以前不久，岸信介曾经在同一个委员会会议上说，如果在日本的美国军事基地受到“攻击”，他就认为是“对日本的侵略”，从而就要同美国采取“联合行动”。
    岸信介的这些谈话不仅露骨地表明他的集团向国外进行军事扩张的潜在的帝国主义野心，同时表明了这个反动集团公然企图违反日本宪法的规定，来驱使日本人民充当美国在亚洲发动侵略战争的炮灰。按照日本宪法第九条的规定，日本必须永远放弃战争和使用武力，并且不承认国家的交战权。
    岸信介9日在参议院预算委员会会议上，还歪曲解释日本宪法禁止日本保有战争力量的规定，企图为使日本进行核武装的阴谋寻求“合法”根据。他说：“如果出现了纯粹是代替现在的步枪的核武器，我想宪法并没有禁止（保有）这种东西”。
