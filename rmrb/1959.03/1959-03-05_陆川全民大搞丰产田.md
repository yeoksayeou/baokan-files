Luchuan Launches Mass Campaign for High-Yield Fields

(Our Nanning Dispatch, March 4) Guangxi's Luchuan County is launching a mass campaign for high-yield fields. Of the county's 150,000+ labor force, over 100,000 have already joined the high-yield field campaign; the early rice planted in these fields covers approximately 200,000 mu, accounting for 60% of the early rice planting area.

The targets and measures for these high-yield fields were developed based on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," combined with last year's experiences, and after full discussions among cadres and the masses. The planned yield for early rice in the high-yield fields is 3,000 to 5,000 jin per mu. Cadres and the masses have shown a high degree of enthusiasm for planting high-yield fields. After determining the high-yield fields, commune members of the Michang Commune immediately brought out more than 14,000 manure-composting vats and placed them at the head of the high-yield fields. Thirteen women, including Wu Yingxian from the Gaozong Work Area of the Daqiao Commune, used their spare time to drain two ponds and dug out 1,400 dan of black pond mud rich in fertilizer, which they applied to their high-yield fields.

Currently, most of the high-yield fields have been plowed and harrowed, and water has been released to irrigate the fields. Manure-composting vats are placed at the head of each field. All 130,000 manure-composting vats in the county are full of fertilizer. The fertilizer transported to the fields and the fertilizer pits are scattered everywhere, and overall transplanting is about to begin.

In order to manage the high-yield fields well from beginning to end, each commune has made good leadership of the high-yield fields an important task. Some communes have also established special organizations or assigned dedicated personnel to strengthen guidance and inspection of the high-yield fields. Competition has begun between communes, between work areas, between production teams, and between individuals.

    陆川全民大搞丰产田
    本报南宁4日电　广西陆川县开展全民大搞高额丰产田运动。全县十五万多劳动力，已有十万多人参加了丰产田运动；所种早稻丰产田约有二十万亩，占早稻播种面积60％。
    这些丰产田的指标、措施，都是依据农业“八字宪法”结合去年的经验，经过干部、群众充分讨论订出来的。丰产田早稻亩产计划是三千到五千斤。干部和群众对种丰产田表现了高度的积极性。米场公社的社员在确定丰产田后，立即拿出了沤肥缸一万四千多个，安置在丰产田头。大桥公社高埇工区伍英先等十三个妇女在工余时间，戽干了两张水塘，挖出一千四百担肥黑的塘泥，加施在自己的丰产田里。
    目前，大部分丰产田已犁、耙过，并放水灌田，块块田头放有沤肥缸。全县十三万个沤肥缸，缸缸肥料满。运下田去的肥料和凼肥窝星罗棋布，全面插秧即将开始。
    为了把丰产田有始有终地经营好，各公社都把领导搞好丰产田作为一项重要任务，有些公社还成立了专门机构或固定专人，加强丰产田的指导和检查。公社与公社、工区与工区、生产队与生产队、人与人之间展开了竞赛。
