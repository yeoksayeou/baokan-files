Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th – Since the Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, it has promoted teaching and scientific research work, and improved teaching quality.

    Since May of last year, the university has changed the past phenomenon of being detached from production and reality, and vigorously organized teachers and students to participate in professional production labor. It has dispatched thirty internal and external operation teams, with external operations covering seven provinces including Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Yunnan, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Heilongjiang. Among them, more than 260 people cooperated with relevant units to complete the comprehensive mapping task of the Sanjiang area in the Great Northern Wilderness. The working conditions in this area were very difficult, with swamps and wild grasses everywhere, no access for boats or vehicles, and they had to carry their own food when walking. Accommodation was often only a shack made of weeds and branches, but they were not daunted by the difficulties, working hard and cleverly, and finally completing the task ahead of schedule. In order to support the mining project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, the students surveying in Guandiankou in western Hubei and Ji'an in Jiangxi, spent months running around in densely forested mountainous areas up to more than 1,000 meters high, completing arduous surveying and mapping tasks to meet the needs of steel production and ore development. In surveying in Xiangfan and Shandong, the teachers and students went to work before dawn, set up instruments waiting for daylight, and did not finish work until after dark. They not only ensured the successful completion of the tasks, but also maintained excellent quality.

    Through production practice, the ability of teachers and students to use theory to solve practical problems has been greatly enhanced, the teaching content has been enriched, and the teaching quality has been improved. When surveying at the Hubei Steel Plant, the students derived a formula for calculating the eccentricity difference when installing the metal cylindrical shell of the blast furnace system based on practical experience, which played a certain role in improving the speed of blast furnace installation at the steel plant. After participating in production, teachers and students accumulated certain production experience, boldly reformed the teaching content, and compiled twelve kinds of teaching materials under the close combination of the Party committee, teachers, and students. It is planned to compile sixty-two kinds of professional teaching materials before this year's "July 1st." These teaching materials are closely integrated with the actual needs of China's socialist construction.

    In production practice, teachers and students have broken superstitions and also begun to attack cutting-edge technologies in surveying and mapping science. In the cooperation between teachers and students, a laser rangefinder and other instruments have been preliminarily trial-produced. In scientific research, special attention has also been paid to serving the current industrial and agricultural production. The surveying teaching and research group of this school collected the farmers' homemade levels, researched and improved them, and used them for simple mapping in people's communes. They also compiled a small booklet of simple surveying work methods, opening up a path for carrying out mass surveying work. Teachers from the cartography department went to the Hongqi People's Commune in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, to study the compilation of an atlas of people's communes with local farmers, and compiled more than thirty maps of people's communes. In this way, the content of scientific research in this college has been greatly enriched this year, and the level of scientific research has been continuously improved.

    Due to linking with reality and serving production, teachers and students have begun to closely link their specialties with national construction, and actively care about production, improve the speed and quality of surveying work. The knowledge that students learn is also more complete than in the past. Through production practice, most students have a further understanding of textbook knowledge.

    向祖国山河求学问
    武汉测绘学院师生深入实际推动了教学和科学研究
    据新华社武汉4日电　武汉测绘学院贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针后，推动了教学和科学研究工作，提高了教学质量。
    从去年5月份起，这个学院改变了过去脱离生产、脱离实际的现象，大力组织师生参加专业生产劳动，先后出动了三十个内外作业队，外业作业地区遍及湖北、湖南、河南、云南、山东、江西、黑龙江等七个省份。其中有二百六十余人与有关单位合作，完成了北大荒三江地区的综合法测图任务。这个地区工作条件非常艰苦，遍地荒草沼泽，舟车不通，行走时还得自背粮食，住宿往往只能用荒草树枝搭个窝棚，但他们并没有被困难吓倒，苦干加巧干，终于提前完成任务。为了支援武钢的开矿工程，在鄂西官店口和江西吉安测量的同学们，几个月一直奔驰在高达一千余公尺的森林茂密的山区中，完成了艰巨的测绘任务，适应了钢铁生产开发矿石的需要。在襄樊及山东等地测量中，师生天不亮就出工，架起仪器等天亮，天黑后才收工，不仅保证顺利地完成任务，而且质量优良。
    通过生产实践，大大锻炼了师生们运用理论解决实际问题的能力，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。在湖北钢厂测量时，同学们根据实际经验推导出安装高炉系统金属圆柱壳体时求偏心差的公式，对提高这个钢厂的高炉安装的速度方面起了一定作用。师生们参加生产后，积累了一定的生产经验，大胆地改革了教学内容，在党委、教师、学生三者紧密结合下，汇编出十二种教材，计划在今年“七一”以前还编写出各种专业教材六十二种。这些教材都是密切结合着我国社会主义建设实际需要的。
    教师、学生在生产实践中，破除了迷信，也开始向测绘科学中的尖端技术进攻。在师生的合作中，初步试制完成了光速测距仪等。在科学研究中，还特别注意了为当前工农业生产服务。这个学校测量学教研组搜集了农民的土制水准仪，加以研究改进，作为人民公社简易测图之用。他们还编写了简易测量工作方法的小册子，为开展群众性测量工作开辟了道路。制图系的教师们到湖北省应城县红旗人民公社，与当地农民一起研究编制人民公社地图集的问题，编成了人民公社地图三十余幅。这样，这个学院今年科学研究内容大大丰富起来，科学研究水平也不断得到提高。
    由于联系实际，服务生产，师生开始把自己的专业和国家建设密切联系起来，主动地关心生产，提高测量工作速度和质量。学生学到的知识也比过去完整，通过生产实践，大多数学生对书本知识有了进一步的理解。
