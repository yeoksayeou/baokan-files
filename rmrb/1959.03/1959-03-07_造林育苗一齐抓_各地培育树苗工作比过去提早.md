　　Grasp Afforestation and Seedling Cultivation Simultaneously
　　Seedling Cultivation Work in Various Regions Started Earlier Than in the Past
　　(Our Dispatch) Currently, while carrying out the spring afforestation movement, a mass seed collection and seedling cultivation movement is underway across the country. According to statistics from twelve southern provinces, 460,000 mu of seedlings have already been sown, and preparations are actively underway in the north.
    This year, seedling cultivation plans in various regions have increased more than twofold compared to 1958. In order to change the past situation of slow growth and low survival rates with direct sowing afforestation, Guangdong Province is focusing on seedling cultivation this year, with a provincial seedling cultivation plan reaching 1.54 million mu. The seedling cultivation tasks in Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Liaoning, Sichuan and other provinces have also greatly increased compared to previous years. This year's seedling cultivation work is generally being grasped early and tightly. In the past, seedling cultivation was grasped after afforestation was completed, but this year most regions are grasping afforestation and seedling cultivation simultaneously. Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and other provinces and regions have successively convened special on-site seedling cultivation meetings to summarize the rich experiences of seedling cultivation last year. Hebei Province has proposed that every commune, team, and farm should carry out seedling cultivation movements, and requires that 30% of the area be used as high-yield nurseries to ensure quality and quantity. Many communes have established nursery management committees to uniformly lead seedling cultivation work. The Party committees of many counties and communes in Guangdong Province personally lead and specifically arrange seedling cultivation work.
    In order to implement high-yield measures for seedling cultivation and improve the quality of seedlings, various regions have further carried out high-yield movements based on summarizing last year's high-yield experiences. Hunan Province has proposed five high-yield measures: deep plowing and multiple harrowing, meticulous land preparation (plowing depth of one to one and a half chi, and adopting the method of tandem plowing and re-cultivation); applying sufficient organic fertilizer in layers, and topdressing appropriately and on time; preventing drought and waterlogging; early sowing and appropriate dense sowing; and doing a good job in pest and disease prevention. In order to strengthen technical guidance on seedling cultivation, Luoding, Gaozhou and other counties in Guangdong selected more than 100 experienced old farmers to travel around to guide seedling cultivation work.

    造林育苗一齐抓
    各地培育树苗工作比过去提早
    本报讯　目前，全国各地在春季造林运动的同时，开展了一个群众性采种、育苗运动。据南方十二个省统计，已播种育苗四十六万亩，北方正积极进行准备。
    今年各地育苗计划较1958年增加二倍多，广东省为了改变过去直播造林成长慢，成活率低的情况，今年大抓育苗工作，全省育苗计划达一百五十四万亩。河南、江苏、山西、辽宁、四川等省的育苗任务也都较往年大大的增加，今年的育苗工作一般都抓的早，抓的紧。过去情况是抓完造林、再抓育苗，今年大部地区造林育苗一齐抓。山西、河南、河北、江西、湖南、江苏、辽宁等省区已先后召开了专门的育苗现场会议，总结了去年育苗的丰富经验。河北省提出社社、队队、场场开展育苗运动，并要求以30％的面积作为丰产苗圃，以保质保量。许多公社成立了苗圃管理委员会，统一领导育苗工作。广东省许多县、社党委亲自领导和具体安排育苗工作。
    为了贯彻育苗的丰产措施，提高育苗质量，各地在总结去年丰产经验的基础上，进一步开展了丰产运动。湖南省提出了五项丰产措施：深耕多犁，细致整地，（耕深一至一尺五寸，并采用套犁复耕的办法）；分层施足有机肥料，适量适期追肥；防旱防涝；早期播种，适当密播；作好病虫害防治。广东罗定、高州等县，为了加强育苗技术指导，推选了一百多名老农，巡回各地指导育苗工作。
