Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. After overfulfilling the plan in January, the vast number of workers on the capital's industrial front advanced victoriously and achieved new victories in February, which had only twenty-one working days. According to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, the city's total industrial output value in February exceeded the plan by 5.9%, an increase of 157.7% over the same period last year. The average daily output value increased by 11.1% compared with the previous month. The output of products such as pig iron, cement, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, power machinery, and lifting and transportation equipment all exceeded the monthly plan.

Anticipating that there would be fewer working days in February due to the Spring Festival holiday, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China deployed the production work for February as early as late January, and put forward the battle call to all employees to "resolutely complete and overfulfill the February plan, maintain tense production before the Spring Festival, and strive for full attendance and a good start after the Spring Festival." Based on the call of the Municipal Party Committee, the leaders of many factories and mining enterprises went deep into the masses to mobilize them and "disclosed" the monthly tasks to the employees, mobilizing everyone to put forward measures and come up with ideas. Many factory workers proposed to strive for "everyone red, every day red, and the whole month red" in production, and launched a lively socialist competition. Leaders at all levels in many factories checked the progress of production plans every day, and some even participated in labor with the shift to solve problems at any time. Therefore, the first battle in February was a success, and the city's employees completed the plan for the first ten days of February with an excellent achievement of exceeding 12.7%. The average daily output value of this ten-day period increased by 6.8% compared with the average daily output value of the previous month. As soon as the Spring Festival was over, the vast number of workers returned to their posts with full enthusiasm and began a new battle. Almost all factories and enterprises in the city also seized the Spring Festival holiday to overhaul machinery and equipment, and made a series of preparations for starting production after the Spring Festival, creating favorable conditions for completing the plans for the middle and last ten days of the month.

Due to the implementation of the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard", many electromechanical factories completed the tasks of finishing production with low output value and miscellaneous varieties with a high degree of enthusiasm in the production in February. For example, according to national needs, the Beijing Cold Wind Machinery Factory increased the variety of blowers and ventilators from several types last year to thirty-four types. Although the output value was reduced, the factory completed the monthly plan one day ahead of schedule on the 27th. The Beijing Metal Structure Factory organized a large-scale collaboration throughout the factory and rushed out a large number of non-standard equipment urgently needed for many key construction projects in the city in a timely manner.

Under the guidance of the idea of an all-round Great Leap Forward, many factories grasped output value, output, quality, and cost together from the beginning, and mobilized the masses to attack the key problems and weak links in the all-round leap forward of their units. All the workers of the first steelmaking workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant launched a "six comparisons" (comparing quality, comparing smelting time, comparing material consumption, comparing equipment maintenance, comparing safety, and comparing collaboration) red flag competition movement centered on improving quality, and the entire workshop completed the plan seven days ahead of schedule. The state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory mobilized the masses to focus on product quality, technical management, and reducing the consumption of machinery and materials, and achieved remarkable results. The rate of superior first-class products of cotton yarn in this factory was 51% in the first ten days of the month, rose to 86.82% in the middle ten days of the month, and jumped to 94.69% in the last ten days of the month. The rate of first-class products of cotton cloth increased from 96.49% in January to 98.22%. The Beijing Machine Weaving and Dyeing Factory, which supplies the capital's people with a large amount of colored cloth, mobilized the masses to carry out a vigorous technical revolution, formulated and improved process regulations, promoted advanced experience, and strengthened the inspection of finished and semi-finished products. As a result, the output value and output exceeded the plan ahead of schedule, and the quality of the main products all reached the prescribed standards.

In the production in February, the management work of many factories was further strengthened. Many factories did a more detailed and specific job in planning than before. Many units not only have monthly and ten-day plans, but also formulated daily work plans. For example, in addition to having a daily plan for the entire factory, the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory also has daily plans for workshops, sections, and groups, and has taken a series of measures to ensure the completion of the daily plans. This factory completed the February plan 3% ahead of schedule on the 24th. Another aspect of strengthening management work is to rectify and strengthen management work institutions and establish and improve some necessary rules and regulations. Many factories in Chaoyang District strengthened and rectified the inspection section and the laboratory, and the Beijing Winery transferred the finished product inspectors who had been transferred to other jobs back to their original posts. In order to ensure product quality, the Beijing Switch Factory, in addition to strictly implementing some of the original systems, also established a substitute material control system based on the new situation. The system stipulates that the use of substitute materials must be approved by relevant departments.

Although the industrial production in Beijing in January and February has achieved great achievements, the production plans for many products have not been completed, and some factories have not completed the plans. Now, all factories and mining enterprises are further taking measures to deeply mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technical revolution, and promote a larger-scale mass movement for an all-round leap forward, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the first quarter's plan.

### 第一仗打得好　第二仗打得更好  北京工业超额完成二月计划  日产比上月提高11.1％，总值比去年同期提高一倍半

    第一仗打得好　第二仗打得更好
    北京工业超额完成二月计划
    日产比上月提高11.1％，总值比去年同期提高一倍半
    新华社2日讯　继1月份超额完成计划之后，首都工业战线的广大职工乘胜前进，在仅有二十一个工作日的2月份又取得了新胜利。据北京市统计局统计：2月份全市工业总产值超额5.9％完成计划，比去年同期提高了157.7％；平均日产值比上月提高11.1％；生铁、水泥、棉布、棉纱、动力机械、起重运输设备等产品的产量，都超额完成了月度计划。
    预计到2月份春节放假工作日少的情况，中共北京市委早在1月下旬就部署了2月份的生产工作，并且向全市职工提出了“坚决完成和超额完成2月份计划，春节前紧张生产不松劲，春节后争取全勤生产开门红”的战斗号召。许多厂矿企业领导上依据市委的号召，深入发动群众，把全月任务向职工“交底”，发动大家提措施、想办法。不少工厂的职工提出了要争取生产上“人人红、日日红、全月红”，并且展开了热火朝天的社会主义竞赛。好多工厂的各级领导干部每天检查生产计划完成的情况，有的还跟班参加劳动，随时解决问题。因此，2月份第一仗就旗开得胜，全市职工以超额12.7％的出色成绩完成了2月上旬计划；这一旬的平均日产值，比上月平均日产值增长了6.8％。春节刚过，广大职工又以饱满的热情回到了自己的岗位，开始了新的战斗。全市几乎所有的工厂企业还抓紧春节的休假时间，检修了机器设备，并且做好了春节后开工生产的一系列准备工作，为完成中旬和下旬计划创造了良好条件。
    由于贯彻了“全国一盘棋”的精神，不少机电工厂在2月份的生产中，对产值低、品种杂碎的扫尾生产等任务，同样以高度的积极性来完成。如北京冷风机械厂根据国家需要，把鼓风机、通风机的品种由去年的几种提高到三十四种。这样虽然产值降低了，但是这个厂也在27日提前一天完成了全月计划。北京市金属结构厂全厂组织大协作，及时地把本市很多重点建设项目配套所急需的大批非标准设备赶制了出来。
    在全面大跃进的思想指导下，不少工厂一开始就是产值、产量、质量、成本一起抓，并且发动群众猛攻本单位全面跃进中的关键问题和薄弱环节。北京钢厂第一炼钢车间的全体职工，掀起了一个以提高质量为中心的“六比”（比质量、比冶炼时间、比材料消耗、比设备维护、比安全、比协作）红旗竞赛运动，全车间提前七天完成了计划。国营北京第一棉纺织厂发动群众大抓产品质量、技术管理和减少机物料的消耗，取得显著成效。这个厂棉纱的上等一级品率上旬为51％，中旬上升到86.82％，下旬就一跃而为94.69％，棉布的一等品率由1月份的96.49％上升到98.22％。供应首都人民大量色布的北京市机织印染厂发动群众大闹技术革命，制订和改进工艺规程，推广先进经验，加强成品和半成品的检验，结果产值、产量提前超额完成计划，主要产品的质量全部达到了规定的标准。
    在2月份的生产中，不少工厂管理工作也进一步加强了。许多厂计划工作较前做得细致、具体。不少单位不但订有月计划、旬计划，还订出了日的作业计划。如北京电子管厂除了订有全厂日计划以外，车间、工段和小组都订有日计划，并且采取了一系列的措施来保证日计划的完成。这个工厂在24日超额3％提前完成了2月份计划。加强管理工作的另一个方面是整顿和加强管理工作机构，建立与健全一些必要的规章制度。朝阳区很多工厂加强与整顿了检验科和化验室，北京酿酒厂将过去抽调做其他工作的成品检验工调回了原岗位。北京开关厂为了保证产品质量，除了严格执行原来的一些制度以外，根据新的情况还建立了代用材料控制制度，制度规定用代用材料必须得到有关部门的批准。
    北京全市1、2月份的工业生产虽然取得了很大的成就，但是有不少产品的生产计划没有完成，有些工厂也没有完成计划。现在，各厂矿企业正在进一步采取措施，深入发动群众，大搞技术革命，促成一个全面跃进的更大规模的群众运动，为全面超额地完成第一季度的计划而努力。
