It was a chance opportunity that allowed me to visit this small Ant Island in the East China Sea. This is a very small island in the Zhoushan Islands, yet it fully reflects the true picture of happy family and women's lives in our country after communization.

Ant Island, surrounded by rolling waves, has five hundred and eighty-six fishing households and was a famous poor island in the past. "Grass roots dug clean, bitter vegetables swallowed whole, young children sold to Shenjiamen, young girls sold to Shitou." This is a portrayal of the tragic lives of fishermen in the past. But with the establishment of the people's commune here, the lives of the fishermen have changed. They no longer live in dilapidated thatched huts, but in newly built tile-roofed houses, and everyone eats white rice and wears new clothes. The collective welfare undertakings of the commune, such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and maternity hospitals, are the icing on the cake, making the lives of the fishermen better and better.

		The Fourteenth Child

As soon as I arrived on the island, the fisherwomen told me that a woman named Yan Cuiying had recently given birth to her fourteenth child and wanted me to visit her. That day I went to her house to see her, and I saw Yan Cuiying breastfeeding her child. Her face was rosy and she was round and plump, and the clothes on her body seemed too tight. Because Cuiying had plenty of milk, the newborn was even more white and chubby, and didn't look like a two-month-old baby at all.

When Cuiying chatted with me, she happily told me, "This is all thanks to the benefits brought by the commune. I have given birth to thirteen children, and none of them has been as happy as this child." It turned out that her husband was a fisherman on the island, and their life was very hard in the past. Yan Cuiying gave birth to so many children because of poor living conditions and malnutrition. The children had illnesses but no money to treat them, and seven of them died one after another. How sad a mother must have been! Not only that, but she herself couldn't get proper care. After giving birth, she could only drink some sweet potato soup, and there was no question of rest. She often went to work the day after giving birth. Long-term postpartum disorders made her suffer from various ailments.

If you don't talk about the past suffering, how can you appreciate the present happiness? Yan Cuiying told me that this time her childbirth was like entering heaven. She gave birth in the commune's maternity hospital, and the midwife took care of her meticulously, so she didn't have to worry about anything. The commune also stipulated that she should rest for forty days. After she returned home, the canteen sent her meals, with chicken, meat, eggs, and brown sugar. She didn't have to worry about housework at all. The older children went to school, the younger ones were in kindergarten, and the commune collectively took care of laundry and sewing. When people are in good spirits when good things happen, this time she gave birth and her body was much healthier. Talking about this, she complained:
	"To ask me to rest for so many days is really like being a fairy."

			The Fisherwoman's Mother-in-Law is Delighted

Fisherman Yu Songhua recently married a new wife, which was a great joy that his mother had been looking forward to for many years. The old lady is sixty-four years old this year. Her husband was a poor fisherman who went blind in his thirties and couldn't fish. The couple lived by twisting straw ropes. For many years, they had been drinking sweet potato soup and living in thatched houses. They barely made it to liberation, and the lives of the fishermen improved, but because there was little labor in their family, Songhua was only a teenager at that time and couldn't do much work. The old woman had to take care of the food and clothing of three people by herself and rarely had time to participate in labor. The family's income could only make ends meet. Last year, the commune was established, and eating in the canteen was free, and the commune took care of laundry and sewing. This was something the old woman never dreamed of.

What made the old lady even more satisfied was her nineteen-year-old new daughter-in-law, Han Lianhua. She is a capable worker and filial to her parents-in-law. Now Yu Songhua has become a fisherman, and the old woman usually helps twist some straw ropes when she has nothing to do. The family's income has exceeded the level of wealthy fishermen. In this ordinary fishing family, there is really a harmonious scene everywhere.

				Civilized Family

By the sea lives the family of ship boss Xu Aying. In the past, this family was famous throughout the island for quarreling. The couple quarreled almost every day, and almost all the utensils in the house were broken. In the past, people who didn't understand the inside story said that Aying had a bad temper, so he liked to quarrel. In fact, he was wronged. He didn't like to quarrel, but was really forced to by life.

However, these things are already in the past. After liberation, their lives have greatly improved. After the establishment of the people's commune, with the canteen, kindergarten, sewing group, and laundry group, Aying's family no longer quarrels over trivial matters in life. Aying, who used to have a face, now talks and laughs. He goes out to sea every morning and returns in the evening. The canteen prepares hot dishes and meals for him, so that he can eat his fill. Aying's wife, who used to be sad, is now in a good mood and looks younger. She no longer revolves around the stove and children every day, and can wholeheartedly participate in production. All five children have entered elementary school and kindergarten, and the aunt takes care of them cleanly, so the mother doesn't have to worry about it at all. That day when I was at their house, Aying's wife said with a smile, "We have been married for more than ten years, and now we really have the appearance of a family. Everyone laughs and doesn't quarrel anymore. Aying and the children all come home in the evening, and our family is lively."

    这里充满了家庭生活的乐趣
    ——蚂蚁岛渔民家庭生活见闻
    新华社记者  朱敏之
    是一个偶然的机会，使我能够访问东海上这个小小的蚂蚁岛。这是舟山群岛中的一个极小的岛子，然而它完全能够反映出我国公社化以后，家庭和妇女幸福生活的真面貌。
    滔滔海浪环抱着的蚂蚁岛，有五百八十六户捕鱼人家，过去是有名的穷岛。“草子根，挖干净，苦莲菜，整株吞，小娃卖给沈家门，小娘卖给峙头人”。这就是过去渔民们悲惨生活的写照。可是随着这里人民公社的成立，渔民生活变了样，他们不再住那破烂的草屋，家家都住上了新建的瓦屋，人人吃上白米饭，穿上新衣服。公社成立的食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、妇产院等集体生活福利事业，更是锦上添花，使渔民们的生活越来越美好。
          第十四胎
    一到岛上，渔家姐妹们就告诉我说，妇女颜翠英最近生了第十四个孩子，要我去访问她。那天我到她家去看望，只见颜翠英正在给孩子喂奶，她脸色红润，长得圆胖胖的，身上的衣服都显得太窄小了。因为翠英的奶旺，新生的那个小子更是白胖可爱，怎么看也不像是二个月的婴儿。
    翠英和我拉话的时候，乐呵呵地告诉我说：“这都是公社带来的好处?，我生过十三个孩子，哪有这个孩子这么幸福。”原来她丈夫是岛上的渔工，过去生活很苦，颜翠英生了这么多的孩子，就是因为生活不好，营养不良，孩子有病无钱医治，先后死了七个。做妈妈的心里该是多么难过啊！不但这样，她自己因为得不到调养，生了孩子只能喝点蕃薯汤，更谈不上休息，常是生了孩子的第二天就去干活，长时期的产后失调使她得了一身病痛。
    不说过去的苦那能体会到现在的幸福呢？颜翠英告诉我，这次她生产简直像入了天堂，她是在公社的妇产院里分娩的，接生员对她照顾无微不至，她一点不用操心。公社还规定她休息四十天，她回家后，食堂给她送饭来，有鸡，有肉，还有鸡蛋和红糖。家务事她根本不用操心，大孩子进了学校，小的在幼儿园，洗衣缝纫都由公社集体代管。人逢喜事精神爽，这回她生了孩子身体也健康得多了。谈到这里，她抱怨说：
  “要我休息这么多天，真是要做神仙了。”
                乐煞渔家婆
    渔工禹松华最近娶了个新媳妇，这是他妈妈多年以来盼望的大喜事。老太婆今年六十四岁，她丈夫是个穷苦的渔工，三十多岁那年又瞎了眼睛，不能捕鱼，夫妇俩就靠搓草绳过日子。多少年来，他们一直喝蕃薯汤，住茅草房。好容易挨到解放，渔民生活好转了，可是究竟因为他们家劳力少，松华那时只有十几岁，干不了什么活，老婆婆一人要照料三人的吃穿，很少有空参加劳动，全家收入只能糊口。去年成立了公社，食堂吃饭不要钱，洗衣缝纫都由公社管，这是老婆婆做梦也想不到的事。
    更使老太婆满意的是她的十九岁的新媳妇韩莲花，她是个劳动能手，又孝顺公婆。现在禹松华已当上了渔工，老婆婆平时闲着没事也帮着搓些草绳，全家的收入已超过富裕渔民的水平，在这普通的渔家，真是到处呈现出乐融融的景象。
                    文明家庭
    在海边上，住着船老大徐阿英一家人。过去这户人家是全岛闻名的吵架户。夫妇两人几乎天天吵架，家中的用具差不多都被打光了。过去不了解底细的人都说是阿英脾气坏，所以爱吵架。其实才冤枉他呢，他并不爱吵架，实在是生活逼迫的。
    然而，这些事情已经成为过去了，解放后，他们的生活有了很大的改善。人民公社成立后，有了食堂、幼儿园、缝纫组和洗衣组，阿英家永远不再为生活琐事吵架了。过去整天板着面孔的阿英，现在有说有笑。他每天早上出海，晚上归来，食堂为他准备了热菜热饭，使他吃得饱饱的。过去愁眉苦脸的阿英嫂，现在心情舒畅，人也显得更年轻了。她每天不再围着锅台和孩子转，可以一心一意参加生产。五个孩子都进了小学和幼儿园，阿姨替他们收拾得干干净净，一点不用妈妈操心。那天我在他们家时，阿英嫂笑嘻嘻地对我说：“我们结婚十几年，现在才真正有了个家庭的样子，大家笑呵呵不再吵闹了，晚上阿英和孩子们都回家，我们一家人热热闹闹。”
