The Story of Zhang Qiuxiang and Xue Junxiu's Cotton Planting Competition
By Our Reporters Wu Gang and Yuan Mu

After getting off the bus, Zhang Qiuxiang rushed straight to Xue Junxiu's home without even going home first. She was eager to know how much cotton her competitor had yielded.

Zhang Qiuxiang and Xue Junxiu were both in the Shuangwang Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Weinan County. When she left her hometown to attend the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Conference and the National Advanced Agricultural Units Representatives Conference in Beijing, Xue Junxiu's cotton had not yet been completely harvested. According to the estimates at the time, Xue Junxiu's cotton yield was about the same as hers. During the more than one month of the conference, she had written letters asking about it, but there was no reliable news. Now, she had to ask clearly immediately.

"Junxiu, how is your cotton harvest?" She stepped over the threshold and asked without any greeting.

"An average of more than three thousand catties per mu."

"You've caught up with me, what a great thing!"

"Oh! Isn't that what you, as our teacher, taught us to do!" Xue Junxiu's words were full of gratitude to Qiuxiang. The two were completely immersed in the joy of their joint leap forward. That evening, they walked, talking and laughing, to a plot of land outside the village. This plot of land was their twenty mu of cotton fields, each responsible for half this year. In order to better learn from each other and compete with each other, they were connected side by side. Looking at the fertile land that had been deeply ploughed three feet and had just been spring-irrigated, they sat side by side on the edge of the field, discussing this year's competition plan.

	A Small Misunderstanding

The cotton planting competition between Zhang Qiuxiang and Xue Junxiu started as early as the spring of 1957. At that time, Zhang Qiuxiang had already created the highest record in the province for two consecutive years with a yield of more than 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu. Xue Junxiu, on the other hand, only harvested more than 40 catties of seed cotton per mu because she did not understand the technology. Under the encouragement of Yang Wenhuan, the secretary of the township party committee at the time, she finally mustered the courage to learn from Qiuxiang and catch up with Qiuxiang. Their competition started from here.

Because they didn't understand each other, a small misunderstanding occurred in the year the competition started.

One dark night, Xue Junxiu and another female companion took a flashlight and quietly went to Qiuxiang's cotton field. They looked from one end of the field to the other, carefully counting the cotton bolls. What good cotton! The cotton bolls were dense and piled up like horse bells. "Why does Qiuxiang have more bolls than mine?" Xue Junxiu wondered, but she didn't ask Qiuxiang. It wasn't that she was unwilling to ask others for advice, but she was worried that Qiuxiang would not teach her. As for Zhang Qiuxiang, she was happy to tell anyone her experience, but if others didn't ask her, she was too embarrassed to take the initiative to teach others, for fear that people would say she was a "know-it-all." The next day, when Qiuxiang heard that Xue Junxiu had gone to her field to count cotton bolls at night, she was a little unhappy.

"What is she doing? It's not like I wouldn't teach her." Afterwards, Qiuxiang complained to Secretary Yang.

"This is a good thing!" Secretary Yang said, "It would be even better if all the women in the township were vying to see your cotton at night, and everyone was striving to catch up with Qiuxiang!"

Secretary Yang's words gave Qiuxiang a great inspiration. She thought: It's not good for one person to be good, it's good for everyone to be good. It's not enough for Zhang Qiuxiang alone to have high cotton yields. It would be really good if the whole country had high cotton yields. Zhang Qiuxiang quickly took the initiative to go to Xue Junxiu's cotton field.

	Not Only Learned the Technology

Last year, Xue Junxiu encountered serious setbacks at the beginning of the competition: When spraying insecticide, she used too much, and a large area of cotton seedlings that had sprouted half a foot high were burned to death. She had just spent days and nights braving the rain to replant the cotton seedlings, and just as the new seedlings were about to catch up with the old seedlings, they were hit by a serious insect plague, and the cotton seedlings were bitten into pieces by cutworms.

At that time, Qiuxiang had just returned from Dali County after teaching cotton planting experience. When she heard that Junxiu's cotton had been eaten by insects, she rushed to Junxiu's field without going home. She found Junxiu and told her that cutworms love to eat oil residue. Mixing the oil residue with 666 powder and sprinkling it on the ground can eliminate cutworms. At the same time, she also helped Junxiu prepare the powder.

"What a selfless person!" Junxiu really didn't know how to thank Qiuxiang. What she got from Qiuxiang was not only cotton planting technology, but also this noble thought. It was with the support of this kind of thought that Junxiu, although she felt that she didn't have much experience to help Qiuxiang, told Qiuxiang all the new measures she thought of or took to surpass Qiuxiang without reservation. When Liu Shuxian's cotton field was infested with insects, she stopped treating the insects in her own cotton field and took the initiative to help Liu Shuxian treat the insects. Seeing that Wu Shuqian's cotton field needed oil residue but didn't have it, she gave her her own share.

	Enthusiastic Competition, Fruitful Results

The two competitors' mood of helping each other and striving to surpass each other in the competition was always intertwined. This enthusiasm for winning the red flag for high cotton yields was most prominent at the on-site conference on women's cotton planting competition in fourteen counties held by the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation in Weinan County last year.

"Guarantee a cotton yield of 1,500 catties per mu this year," Qiuxiang was the first to put forward the highest production target. However, she never expected that her opponent Xue Junxiu would immediately propose to "yield 2,000 catties per mu."

As soon as the meeting was over, she immediately convened her team members to add measures and targets. "The red flag for high cotton yields must be kept." Zhang Qiuxiang told her team members. Xue Junxiu also declared to her team members: "I am determined: even if it rains hailstones, I have to catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang!" They thought so, and they did so. After Xue Junxiu asked Qiuxiang how to fertilize the cotton field, Qiuxiang applied 80 catties of oil residue per mu, and she applied 100 catties; she saw that her cotton bolls were not as many as Qiuxiang's, and after learning from Qiuxiang the method of postponing topping and leaving more branch bolls, she decided to top a few days after Qiuxiang topped. Qiuxiang's enthusiasm was no less than Junxiu's. When she was seeing a doctor in another place and learned that Junxiu's cotton was growing taller than hers, she hurried back with medicine packs and worked on improving the cotton field all night until it surpassed Junxiu's cotton. When she saw that Junxiu had more and bigger cotton bolls than hers because of the delayed topping, she immediately took various measures to strive to surpass Junxiu in boll size and fiber length in the situation that new cotton bolls could no longer be increased.

This kind of competition itself is a very good support and encouragement for each other. Just like what Qiuxiang and Junxiu often tell each other: If I catch up with you, your energy will be greater; if you want to surpass me, I will have more energy. Because these two competitors both have the desire to increase cotton production for the motherland and hope that each other will have a bumper harvest, although they strive to surpass each other, not only has it not weakened in the slightest, but it has strengthened the help and friendship between each other. When Qiuxiang knew that Junxiu's phosphate fertilizer was insufficient and the cotton leaves were green in one area and yellow in another, she immediately sent her superphosphate to her; when she visited Hebei and learned to prevent boll shedding by sprinkling sugar water, she immediately wrote a letter to tell Junxiu. Junxiu also told Qiuxiang in detail every time she applied more fertilizer than Qiuxiang, or when she topped a few days later than Qiuxiang.

After a year of intense competition, both of these competitors achieved unprecedented bumper harvests last year: Qiuxiang's four mu and three-fen cotton fields averaged 2,993 catties of seed cotton per mu, and the highest mu reached 3,400 catties. Junxiu's three mu and nine-fen land yielded 3,104 catties of seed cotton per mu. Although the highest mu yield was not as good as Qiuxiang's, the average mu yield exceeded Qiuxiang's by more than 100 catties. The friendship established in the hot competition is the most solid. Now they attend meetings together, make plans together, and conduct this year's competition on a piece of land connected side by side.

    张秋香和薛俊秀植棉竞赛的故事
    本报记者　吴钢　袁木
    张秋香下车后，家也顾不得回，直奔薛俊秀家里去。她迫切地要知道她的竞赛对手的棉花产量究竟怎样。
    薛俊秀和张秋香同在渭南县城关公社的双王生产大队。当她离开家乡，到北京参加全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子大会和全国农业先进单位代表会议时，薛俊秀的棉花还没有全部收完。按当时估算，薛俊秀的棉花产量和她的差不多。在一个多月的开会期间，她曾连连写信问过，都没有可靠的消息。现在，她必须马上问清楚了。
      “俊秀，你的棉花收成怎样？”她跨进门槛，来不及寒暄就问了。
    “平均一亩收了三千多斤。”
    “你撵上了我，大喜事啊！”
    “哎呀！这还不是老师你教我们作务的！”俊秀这句话里，充满了对秋香的感激。两个人完全沉浸在共同跃进的欢乐之中。就在那天傍晚，她们又说着笑着走到村外的一块地头。这块地是她们今年各自负责一半的二十亩棉田。为了更好地互相学习和互相竞赛，才连了畔。她俩看着已经深翻过三尺和刚春灌过的肥沃土地，并肩坐在地边，谈着今年的竞赛计划。
        一次小小的误会
    张秋香和薛俊秀之间的植棉竞赛，早在1957年春天就开始了。那时，张秋香已经连续两年创造了亩产籽棉千斤以上的全省最高纪录。而薛俊秀因为不懂技术，一亩才拾了四十多斤籽棉。在当时乡党委书记杨文焕的鼓励下，她终于鼓起勇气，学秋香赶秋香。她们的竞赛就从这里开始了。
    由于她俩彼此不了解，在竞赛开始的那年，曾发生过一次小小的误会。
    一天黑夜，薛俊秀同另一个女伴拿着手电筒，悄悄地到秋香的棉花地里。她们从地这头看到那头，仔细地数着棉桃。多好的棉花啊！棉桃密密累累，像马串铃一样。“秋香的桃子为啥比我的多呢？”薛俊秀疑惑不解，可也没有去问秋香。他倒不是不愿意向别人请教，只是耽心秋香不教给她。而张秋香呢，她乐意把自己的经验告诉任何人，可是别人不去问她，她也不好意思主动地去教别人，生怕人家说她“好为人师”。第二天，秋香一听说薛俊秀黑夜到她的地里数棉桃，她心里就有些不高兴了。
    “这是干啥呢？又不是我不教给她。”事后，秋香向杨书记抱怨说。
      “这是好事嘛！”杨书记说：“要是全乡的妇女，都争着黑夜去看你的棉花，人人争先赶秋香，那才更好啊！”
    杨书记的话，给了秋香很大的启发，她想：一人好不算好，大家好才算好，只有找张秋香一个人棉花高产不行，全国的棉花都高产，那才是真好哩。张秋香很快就主动地到薛俊秀的棉田里去了。
              不光学到了技术
    去年薛俊秀在竞赛一开始就碰到了严重的挫折：喷洒防虫药剂时用过了量，四亩已经出土半尺的棉苗烧死了一大片。刚刚几天几夜冒雨突击把棉苗补上，眼看新苗就要赶上老苗，又遭到了严重的虫灾，棉苗被地老虎咬得七零八落。
    那时，秋香刚从大荔县传授植棉经验回来。她一听说俊秀的棉花被虫咬了，顾不得回家，连忙到俊秀的地里去。她找到俊秀，告诉她地老虎最爱吃油渣，油渣里拌和上六六六药粉，洒在地里，就能消灭地老虎；同时，她又帮助俊秀张罗拌药粉。
    “一个多么无私的人啊！”俊秀真不知道怎样感激秋香才好。她从秋香那里得到的不仅是植棉技术，还有这高贵的思想。也就是在这种思想的支持下，俊秀虽然觉得自己没有甚么经验可以帮助秋香，但只要她想到或者做了那些想要超过秋香的新措施，她都毫不保留地全部告诉给秋香。而当刘述贤的棉田发生虫害时，她就曾停止了自己的棉田治虫，主动去帮助刘述贤治虫。看到吴淑倩的棉田需要油渣而没有油渣，就把自己的分给她。
          热烈的竞赛　丰硕的果实
    两个对手在竞赛中，互相帮助而又力争超过对方的心情，始终交织在一起。这种争夺棉花高产红旗的劲头，在去年陕西省妇女联合会在渭南县召开的十四个县的妇女植棉竞赛现场会议上，表现得最突出。
    “保证今年棉花亩产一千五百斤”，秋香第一个提出了最高的生产指标。但是，她万万也没有料到，她的对手薛俊秀紧接着提出要“亩产二千斤”。
    会一散，她立即召集组员们追加措施和指标。“棉花高产红旗非保住不行。”张秋香这样向组员讲。薛俊秀也向她的组员宣称：“我的决心下定了：那怕天上下碌碡，也得赶上张秋香！”她们这样想，也就这样做。薛俊秀请教过秋香棉田如何施肥以后，秋香每亩追八十斤油渣，她就追一百斤；她看到自己棉桃没有秋香的多，向秋香学习了推迟打尖多留担枝的办法后，决定在秋香打尖之后几天再打尖。秋香的劲头也不下于俊秀。当她在外地看病，知道俊秀的棉花长的比自己的高，赶紧带着药包回来，连夜给棉田整地加工，直到超过俊秀的棉花。当她看到俊秀因为推迟打顶，棉桃比自个的多而大，在已经不能增加新棉桃的情况下，立即采取种种措施，力争在桃大、纤维长上来超过俊秀。
    这种竞赛本身就是彼此很好的支持和鼓舞。正像秋香和俊秀两人时常相互讲的：我赶你呀，你的劲更大；你要超过我嘛，我就更有劲了。这两个对手因为都具有为祖国增产更多的棉花，希望对方都丰产的意愿，虽然力争超过对方，但不仅没有丝毫减弱，反而加强了彼此间的帮助和友谊。当秋香知道俊秀磷肥不足，棉叶长得绿一片黄一片的时候，她马上把自己的过磷酸钙送给她；当她在河北参观，学到用洒白糖水防止落铃时，又马上写信告诉俊秀。俊秀也在每次比秋香多施肥时，或在比秋香推迟几天打顶时，都详细地告诉了秋香。
    一年的紧张竞赛，这两个对手去年都获得了空前大丰收：秋香的四亩三分棉田平均每亩产籽棉二千九百九十三斤，最高的一亩达到三千四百斤。俊秀的三亩九分地每亩产籽棉三千一百零四斤，虽然最高的亩产量还不如秋香，可是平均亩产却超过了秋香一百多斤，在火热的竞赛中建立起来的友谊，是最牢固的。现在她们一起开会，一块制订计划，在一块连畔的土地上进行今年的竞赛。
