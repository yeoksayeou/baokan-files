Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: A Vientiane dispatch: "The Lao Patriotic News" recently published two letters written by Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, in February to Phoui Sananikone, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government. In the letters, Souphanouvong expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Lao authorities' intensified arrests and killings of former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel in the recent period. He solemnly pointed out that Phoui Sananikone and his government must bear full responsibility for these serious situations.

In his letter of February 8th, Souphanouvong listed a large number of persecution facts that occurred in Xieng Khouang, Savannakhet, Saravane, Pakse, and other provinces. Those persecuted included many heads of the Patriotic Party's provincial and county party departments. Souphanouvong cited facts to show that in many cases, the arrests and killings were carried out by fully armed Royal Army troops. Many arrested local Patriotic Party leaders are still being held in government prisons in various places.

In the letter, Souphanouvong accused the military head of Savannakhet Province of openly instructing more than two hundred township and village chiefs to actively suppress former Pathet Lao fighting units as "national enemies."

The letter stated: "All the incidents of threats, arrests, and killings of former Pathet Lao fighting units in various places undoubtedly stem from the government's policy of discrimination and retaliation. This action has had a negative impact on national harmony, undermined the implementation of the Lao unification agreements, and increased the tension in Laos."

The letter stated: "In order to change this situation, I have repeatedly written to you with suggestions. But until now, I have not seen any changes from you and the government. On the contrary, the situation has become more and more serious. Therefore, you and your government must bear full responsibility for the aforementioned incidents."

On February 13th, Prince Souphanouvong wrote to Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone again. In the letter, Souphanouvong mentioned the tragic case of Thao Thiet, a former Pathet Lao fighting unit member in Saravane Province, who was shot and killed by a village chief on January 22nd. The murderer confessed that he killed Thao Thiet on the orders of Captain Khamtan.

In the letter, Souphanouvong pointed out that the killing of Thao Thiet was only one incident in the Lao government's planned killing of former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel. In the past period of time, dozens of former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel have been killed. Souphanouvong requested the Lao government to investigate the killing of Thao Thiet and the killings of thousands of former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel by government personnel, and to give the murderers the punishment they deserve. He also requested the government to investigate the imprisonment of hundreds of former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel in various provinces and to release them.

In the letter, Souphanouvong stated, "I must inform the International Commission for Supervision and Inspection in Laos of the discriminatory and retaliatory actions of government personnel against former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel, because these actions undermine the implementation of the Lao unification agreements stipulated in the Geneva Accords."

Prior to this, Prince Souphanouvong had written to Kade, the Minister of the Interior of the Royal Lao Government, on February 9th, refuting Kade's statement in a letter to Souphanouvong on February 6th that Souphanouvong's "writing to the International Commission for Supervision and Inspection in Laos is illegal."

Souphanouvong said: "It is proper and necessary for me to write to the International Commission for Supervision and Inspection in Laos. Although the Lao International Commission is currently not in Laos, it still exists legally in Laos. Furthermore, the implementation of the Lao unification agreements that both sides have signed is also supervised by the Lao International Commission according to the provisions of the Geneva Accords. And the implementation of this agreement is encountering difficulties and being undermined."

Souphanouvong pointed out that in the face of the increasingly serious situation of persecution of former Pathet Lao fighting unit personnel, "I cannot but, in the name of the Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Party and the representative of the interests of the former Pathet Lao fighting unit side, take responsibility for the former Pathet Lao fighting unit's implementation of the Lao unification agreements, and write to the Lao International Commission requesting it to intervene according to its authority, so that the Lao unification agreements can be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords."

    苏发努冯写信给老挝王国政府首相
    抗议迫害前寮国战斗部队人员
    指出王国政府必须对此负完全责任
    新华社河内20日电　万象消息：“老挝爱国报”最近先后发表了老挝爱国党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在2月间写给老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空的两封信。苏发努冯在信中对老挝当局近一时期变本加厉地逮捕和残杀前寮国战斗部队人员，表示强烈不满，并且严正指出，培·萨纳尼空和他的政府必须对这些严重情况负完全责任。
    苏发努冯在2月8日的信中列举了在川圹、沙湾拿吉、沙拉湾、巴色和其他各省发生的大量迫害事实，受迫害的人包括许多爱国党省县党部的负责人。苏发努冯列举事实说明，逮捕残杀事件在许多情况下，是由武装齐全的王国军队进行的。许多被捕的老挝爱国党地方负责人，现在还关在各地政府的监狱里。
    苏发努冯在信中指责沙湾拿吉省军事负责人公然向二百多名乡长、村长训示，要他们把前寮国战斗部队当作“民族敌人”而积极加以镇压。
    信中说：“所有各地发生的威胁、逮捕和屠杀前寮国战斗部队的事件，毫无疑问是出于政府的歧视、报复政策的指示。这种行动，已对民族的和睦起了不良影响，破坏了老挝统一协议的履行，并使得老挝的局势紧张起来。”
    信中说：“为了改变这种情况，我已经多次写信给你提出建议。但是直到现在，我仍旧没有看到你和政府对我们有什么改变，反而使情况愈来愈加严重。因此，对于上述所发生的事件，你和你的政府要负完全的责任。”
    2月13日，苏发努冯亲王再次写信给培·萨纳尼空首相。苏发努冯在信中提到沙拉湾省一位前寮国战斗部队人员陶迭在1月22日被一位村长枪杀的惨案。凶手已供认他是奉堪坦上尉的命令枪杀陶迭的。
    苏发努冯在信中指出陶迭被杀事件只是老挝政府有计划地杀害前寮国战斗部队人员的行动中的一个事件，在过去的一段时间内，已经有几十个前寮国战斗部队人员被杀害了。苏发努冯要求老挝政府就陶迭被杀事件和政府人员对几千个前寮国战斗部队人员的凶杀事件进行调查，给凶手以应有的处分。他还要求政府就成百前寮国战斗部队人员被监禁在各省这个事件进行调查并且释放他们。
    苏发努冯在信中表示，“我必须把政府人员对前寮国战斗部队人员的歧视和报复行动告诉老挝国际监督和监察委员会，因为这些行动破坏了日内瓦协议所规定的老挝统一协定的实施。
    在这以前，苏发努冯亲王曾经在2月9日写信给老挝王国政府内政大臣卡代，驳斥卡代2月6日在写给苏发努冯的一封信中所说的苏发努冯“写信给老挝国际监督和监察委员会是非法的”的说法。
    苏发努冯说：“我写信给老挝国际监督和监察委员会是正当的，必要的。尽管老挝国际委员会目前不在老挝，但它仍然合法地在老挝存在。再者，履行双方已经签订的老挝统一协议这件事，按照日内瓦协议的规定也是由老挝国际委员会来监督的。而这个协议的履行正在遭到困难和破坏。”
    苏发努冯指出，在迫害前寮国战斗部队人员的事态日益严重的情况下，“我不能不以老挝爱国党主席与前寮国战斗部队方面的利益的代表者的名义，对继承前寮国战斗部队履行老挝统一协议负起责任，写信要求老挝国际委员会根据它的职权出面加以干涉，好让老挝统一协议能够按照日内瓦协议的规定付诸实现。”
