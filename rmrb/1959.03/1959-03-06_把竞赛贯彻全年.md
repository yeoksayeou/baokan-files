Carry Out Competition Throughout the Year

Guangdong and Guangxi have launched province-wide production competitions, arousing even greater revolutionary fervor among the masses. Facts have proven that wherever competition is launched, production becomes vibrant; whichever task launches competition, that task can immediately catch up. Competition has such a significant effect because it mobilizes the masses, and mobilizing the masses is key to improving production. This is a good method for leading the masses to strive for advancement.

The masses have been mobilized, and the competition has unfolded vigorously, but this is only the starting point on the road to competition. A more important question is how to carry out the competition throughout the year? That is, how to continuously organize new competitions based on different seasons, different agricultural activities, and specific circumstances. This is a relatively detailed and complex task, and also the art of leading competition. We hope that various regions can introduce good experiences in these areas. (Attached picture)

The people of Huaibei universally dug river networks in 1958 to eradicate water disasters and develop water conservancy. This is a scene of members of the "March 8th" People's Commune in Su County planting trees along the river network.

### 把竞赛贯彻全年

    把竞赛贯彻全年
    广东、广西展开全省性的生产大竞赛，激起了群众更大的革命干劲。事实证明，那里展开竞赛，那里的生产就搞得热气腾腾；那项工作展开竞赛，那项工作就能立即跟上去。竞赛有这样大的作用，是由于它发动了群众，而发动群众是搞好生产的关键。这是领导群众争上游的好方法。
    群众发动起来了，竞赛轰轰烈烈地展开了，但这只是竞赛道路上的起点；更为重要的问题是，如何把竞赛贯彻全年？就是说，如何根据不同季节，不同农事活动以及本身的具体情况来不断地组织新的竞赛。这是个比较细致复杂的工作，也是领导竞赛的艺术。希望各地能介绍这些方面的好经验。（附图片）
