High-Speed Development of Poultry Farming
By the Editorial Board

In the overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the people across the country are constantly improving. Whether in cities or villages, the demand for non-staple foods has greatly increased. Developing non-staple food production is an important task on China's agricultural front in 1959. The meat and eggs of poultry occupy a very important position in non-staple foods. We must use sufficient strength to develop chickens, ducks, geese, and other poultry, so that this important aspect of non-staple foods will have an even greater and better leap forward in 1959. What issues need attention right now for the high-speed development of poultry production?

In order to rapidly develop poultry production, we must adopt the policy of "walking on two legs" - collective poultry farming by the communes and family poultry farming by the members should be carried out simultaneously.

The establishment of poultry farms by the production teams of the People's Communes for collective poultry raising is the direction for the future large-scale and high-speed development of poultry farming. Collective, specialized, and large-scale poultry raising has many advantages: First, it is easy to adopt advanced technology for scientific management and feeding, which can greatly improve labor productivity; second, the commodity rate is high; third, it can greatly increase the income of the People's Communes and make the economic strength of the communes even stronger. Therefore, every People's Commune must gradually establish poultry farms in each team, management area, and the entire commune, and develop them into a strong poultry industry for the commune. In order to develop the collective poultry industry of the People's Communes quickly, well, and economically, we must currently adhere to the principle of running the communes diligently and thriftily, building farms while producing. In terms of poultry houses and equipment, we should be simple and crude, make full use of old houses, and establish more small and medium-sized farms, with a focus on building large-scale farms. First adopt indigenous methods, and gradually improve the level of modernization of the farms as production gradually develops and economic income gradually increases. Since the People's Communes have not been established for a long time, the development of collective poultry farming is still subject to many constraints. Therefore, while gradually developing collective poultry farming, the People's Communes should also encourage family poultry farming by members. Every household raising a coopful adds up to a large number nationwide.

Not only should we develop rural poultry farming, but we should also encourage all units and places with suitable conditions to raise poultry. Now the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities are generally larger and should establish poultry and egg supply bases, raising large numbers of poultry to achieve self-sufficiency in non-staple foods. Every state-owned farm and ranch must vigorously develop poultry farming, striving to establish modern, large-scale poultry farms. The commodity rate of state-owned poultry farm products is particularly high, and every city should run several. Some places use natural resources and natural favorable conditions to raise poultry on a large scale, such as using barren hills and beaches, adopting grazing-based feeding methods, and establishing "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains" and "Ten Thousand Chicken Beaches." There are wild plant seeds and many small insects that can be used as feed, and there is also wasteland that can be used to grow some feed. This method is very good and should be actively promoted.

To realize the great leap forward in poultry farming this year, we must now seize the opportunity to carry out a spring shock incubation campaign. Whether the poultry industry can develop throughout the year and whether more poultry meat and eggs can be supplied in the second half of the year depends on the number of spring incubations. A small rooster can be slaughtered and eaten three months after hatching, and a small hen can generally start laying eggs five months or more after hatching. Incubating more chicks in the spring will greatly increase the supply of poultry eggs in the second half of the year. Are there enough hatching eggs needed for spring incubation? According to the overall calculation, there is no shortage of hatching eggs. Each province generally has several million or even tens of millions of hens, and the eggs produced can meet the needs of incubation. However, some areas lack hatching eggs. Those areas should adhere to the principle of "eat less and incubate more," preserve hatching eggs as much as possible, and incubate more. In places where hatching eggs are extremely scarce, relevant departments should try to organize adjustments. Currently, many areas have reduced the number of roosters, and there are many infertile eggs that cannot hatch into chicks. We can take measures such as concentrating hens and adjusting roosters to increase the fertilization rate.

There can be a variety of methods for hatching poultry. The suburbs of cities have superior conditions and can carry out large-scale machine incubation, which can improve the hatching rate. The vast rural areas can generally adopt more artificial incubation, striving to ensure that each commune's management area has an incubator and puts it into production as soon as possible. At the same time, mobilize member households raising hens to use old hens to incubate eggs as much as possible.

In order to ensure the stable development of poultry production, we must do everything possible to solve the feed problem. At present, in some areas, the fattening speed of poultry is not fast and the egg production rate is not high due to poor feed arrangements. Therefore, we must vigorously open up feed sources and ensure feed supply in accordance with the principle of green feed as the main component and ensuring a certain amount of concentrated feed; we can also adopt methods such as combining grazing and barn feeding.

Preventing and controlling poultry diseases is an important measure to ensure the great development of poultry farming. We must strengthen epidemic prevention work and strive to eliminate diseases in the shortest possible time. This is of particular significance for the collective poultry raising of the People's Communes. Spring is the season when chicken plague begins to be prevalent. We must focus on both incubation and epidemic prevention, combine it with the entire animal husbandry epidemic prevention work in spring, make unified arrangements, and seize the opportunity to train technical cadres so that each production team has a "chicken doctor." At the same time, step up the preparation of medicines and equipment, and adopt a combination of shock and regular work to prevent and control chicken plague. The People's Commune poultry farms should establish a scientific epidemic prevention system, and also formulate epidemic prevention covenants for privately raised poultry.

As long as the above tasks are done well, the supply of poultry meat and eggs can be greatly increased in the second half of the year. This is a major event closely related to the lives of the people across the country, and we must devote sufficient effort to do it quickly and well!

    高速度发展养禽业
    本报评论员
    在工业农业生产全面大跃进中，全国人民生活水平不断提高。不论在城市或乡村，对于副食品的需要量都大大增加了。发展副食品生产，是1959年我国农业战线上的一项重要任务。家禽的肉和蛋在副食品中占着相当重要的地位，必须用足够的力量发展鸡鸭鹅等家禽，使得副食品的这个重要方面在1959年有一个更大更好的跃进。高速度地发展家禽生产，当前需要注意些什么问题？
    为了把家禽生产迅速地发展起来，必须采取“两条腿走路”的方针——公社集体养禽和社员家庭养禽同时并举。
    人民公社各个生产队举办养禽场，集体饲养家禽，这是今后大量地高速度地发展家禽饲养业的方向。集体化的专业化的大规模的饲养家禽，有很多好处：第一、便于采用先进技术进行科学的管理饲养，可以大大提高劳动生产率；第二、商品率高；第三、可以大大地增加人民公社的收入，使公社的经济力量更加雄厚。因此，每一个人民公社都要逐步建立起各队的、管理区的和全社的养禽场，发展成为公社的强大的养禽业。为了使人民公社集体养禽业多快好省地发展起来，当前必须按照勤俭办社的原则，边生产边建场。在禽舍和设备上要因陋就简，尽量利用旧房，多办小型和中型的饲养场，重点的办大型饲养场。先采用土办法，在生产逐步发展、经济收入逐渐增加以后，再逐步提高饲养场的现代化水平。由于人民公社建立起来的时间还不长，发展集体养禽还受到许多条件限制，因此人民公社在逐步发展集体养禽的同时，还要鼓励社员家庭养禽。每户养一窝，全国凑起来就是一个很大的数字。
    不但要发展农村养禽业，也应提倡一切有条件的单位和地方都养家禽。现在大中城市郊区一般都划大了，应该建立禽蛋供应基地，饲养大批家禽，做到副食品自产自给。每个国营农牧场都要大力发展养禽业，争取创办近代化的较大规模的养禽场。国营养禽场产品的商品率特别大，每个城市都应该办几个。一些地方利用天然资源和天然有利条件来大规模饲养家禽，例如利用荒山、荒滩，采用以放牧为主的饲养方法，建立“万鸡山”“万鸡滩”等。那里有野生的植物籽实和许多小昆虫可以作饲料，也有荒地可以利用种植一些饲料，这种方式是很好的，应该积极提倡。
    要实现今年养禽业的大跃进，现在要抓紧开展春季突击孵化工作。全年养禽业能否发展起来，下半年能否供应更多的禽肉和蛋品，关键在于春孵的多少。一只小公鸡出壳后养育三个月就可以宰食，一只小母鸡出壳后一般的养五个月以上就可以开始产蛋。在春季孵出更多的雏鸡，下半年禽蛋的供应量就会大大增加。春孵需要的种蛋够不够？按大帐来算，种蛋是不缺的。每个省一般都有几百万以至上千万只母鸡，所产的蛋可以满足孵化的需要。但是，有些地区种蛋是缺乏的。那些地区应该根据“少吃多孵”的原则，把种蛋尽量保留下来，多多孵化。种蛋奇缺的地方，有关部门应设法组织调剂。当前许多地区公鸡减少，无精蛋很多，孵不出小鸡。可采取集中母鸡，调剂公鸡等办法，提高受精卵比率。
    家禽孵化的方法，可多种多样化，城市郊区有优越条件，可大搞机器孵化，这样可以提高孵化率。广大农村一般可多采用人工孵化，力争作到每个社的每个管理区都有孵房，并及早投入生产。同时发动养母鸡的社员户尽量用老母鸡孵卵。
    为了保证家禽生产稳定发展，必须千方百计解决饲料问题。目前，一部分地区由于饲料安排不好，家禽的育肥速度不快，产蛋率不高。因此，必须按照以青绿饲料为主、保证一定精饲料的原则，大力开辟饲料来源，保证饲料供应；还可以采用放牧和舍饲相结合等办法。
    防治家禽疫病是保证养禽事业大发展的一项重要措施。必须加强防疫工作，争取在最短期内消灭疫病。这对于人民公社集体饲养家禽更具有突出的意义。春季正是鸡瘟开始流行季节，必须一手抓孵化，一手抓防疫，结合春季整个畜牧防疫工作，统一布置，抓紧训练技术干部，作到每个生产队都有“鸡大夫”。同时加紧准备药械，采取突击和经常工作相结合的办法防治鸡瘟。人民公社养禽场要建立一套科学的防疫制度，对私养家禽也要拟订防疫公约。
    只要把以上这些工作做好了，下半年就可以大大增加禽肉禽蛋供应。这是同全国人民生活有密切关系的一件大事，必须拿出足够的力量来，把它做得又快又好！
