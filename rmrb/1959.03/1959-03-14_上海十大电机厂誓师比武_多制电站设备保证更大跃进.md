Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: Shanghai's top ten electric machinery plants are launching a red flag competition to ensure the timely, high-quality, and sufficient completion of state plans, and to support the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production with more complete sets of power station equipment.

On the 11th, over two thousand worker representatives from these ten factories held a red flag competition oath-taking rally at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant and signed a red flag competition contract. The contract stipulates that in the future, each factory will summarize monthly and evaluate quarterly the implementation of six state plan indicators: output, quality, new products, labor productivity, cost, and profits turned over to the state. It also covers the execution of six measures: large-scale mass movements, vigorous technical revolution, and promoting the spirit of communist cooperation.

Participating in the red flag competition are ten factories including Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, Shanghai Turbine Plant, Shanghai Boiler Plant, Shanghai Cable Plant, Pioneer Electric Machinery Plant, and Xintong Machinery Plant, which manufacture complete sets of power generation equipment and other important electric machinery products. At the oath-taking rally, representatives from each factory proposed to produce more power station equipment and other electric machinery products in March to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state plans for the first quarter and the entire year. Representatives from Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant and Turbine Plant both proposed that in addition to completing the production increase plan, they would also guarantee to trial-manufacture various large, advanced, precision, and cutting-edge new products. The Turbine Plant had already successfully experimented with the hot-rolling and cold-drawing method to manufacture blades in March, solving a key problem in turbine production. Therefore, they also guaranteed to the conference that in the second half of the year, they would produce blades that could be assembled into a one-million-kilowatt turbine to support other brother turbine plants. The Shanghai Boiler Plant, which had just completed the production of a 280-ton large power station boiler twenty-two days ahead of schedule on March 8, proposed at the meeting that in addition to ensuring the early completion of the first quarter's power station boiler production plan, they would continue to save raw materials, etc. Xintong Machinery Plant, which comprehensively completed twelve economic indicators last year, guaranteed at the meeting to increase the production of more condensers, etc., to meet the needs of complete sets of power station equipment. The Shanghai Pioneer Electric Machinery Plant, Xinmin Machinery Plant, and Sifang Boiler Plant, which had never manufactured power station equipment in the past, also proposed their own competition targets and guarantees: to mass-produce small and medium-sized power station equipment within the year.

    上海十大电机厂誓师比武
    多制电站设备保证更大跃进
    据新华社上海12日电　上海十大电机厂开展红旗竞赛，保证按时、按质、按量完成国家计划，以更多的成套电站设备支援全国工农业生产大跃进。
    11日，这十家工厂的二千多职工代表在上海电机厂举行红旗竞赛誓师大会，签订红旗竞赛合同。合同规定今后各厂要每月总结，按季评比产量、质量、新产品、劳动生产率、成本、上缴利润六项国家计划指标，大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命、发扬共产主义协作精神等六项措施的执行情况。
    参加红旗竞赛的是上海电机厂、上海汽轮机厂、上海锅炉厂、上海电缆厂、先锋电机厂和新通机器厂等十家制造成套发电设备和其他重要电机产品的工厂。在誓师大会上，各厂代表纷纷提出要在3月份内生产更多的电站设备和其他电机产品，保证完成和超额完成第一季度和全年的国家计划。上海电机厂、汽轮机厂的代表都提出除了完成增产计划以外，都保证要试制出各种大型、高级、精密、尖端的新产品。汽轮机厂3月份已试验成功用热轧、冷拉法制造叶片，解决了汽轮机生产的关键问题，因此他们还向大会保证：在今年下半年拿出可以装配一百万瓩汽轮机的叶片来支援其他兄弟汽轮机厂。刚在3月8日提前二十二天完成二百八十吨大型电站锅炉的上海锅炉厂，在会上提出除了保证提前完成第一季度电站锅炉的生产计划以外，还要继续节约原材料等。去年全面完成十二项经济指标的新通机器厂，在会上保证要增产更多的冷凝器等，来满足成套电站设备需要。过去从未制造过电站设备的上海先锋电机厂、新民机器厂和四方锅炉厂，也都提出自己的竞赛指标和保证：年内要成批制造中小型电站设备。
