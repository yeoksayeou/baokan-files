Fuzhou, March 2nd (reported by our newspaper) - The Chengmen People's Commune in Minhou County, Fujian, launched a mass debate in early February focusing on close planting. This debate greatly enhanced the confidence of the commune members in increasing production. They consciously set advanced targets for the year, guaranteeing a per-mu yield of 3,000 jin of rice and striving for 4,000 jin. If the target of 3,000 jin per mu of rice is achieved, the total grain output of the entire commune this year can reach 45 million jin, more than double that of 1958.

	Dense Planting or Sparse Planting?

	On the Spring Festival day, Ye Fei, the First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other responsible comrades visited the Pandun Brigade of the Chengmen Commune to inquire about the farmers' Spring Festival celebrations. At the same time, he also asked the commune members about the spring plowing preparations. The commune members said that this year the plowing was deep, the work started early, and more fertilizer was accumulated than in previous years. They expressed great confidence in this year's great leap forward in agriculture. When Comrade Ye Fei asked about the density of early rice seedlings this year, the old farmer Pan Weizeng said first, "This year, we should plant at eight-inch spacing (sparse planting)." The well-to-do middle peasants Pan Daigui and Pan Yugui immediately supported his opinion. The brigade cadre Huang Baoluo, who was present, advocated 5 × 2 inches, and military dependent Pan Zuotong agreed with his opinion. The young people and women present also had some other suggestions for dense planting. Seeing this situation, Comrade Ye Fei suggested to the Chengmen Commune Party Committee to use the holiday time to launch a large-scale debate on dense planting throughout the commune. Through debate, production increase targets and measures should be formulated. Immediately following, a large-scale debate was launched in all sixteen brigades of the commune in a guided manner. This five-day debate was attended by poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants, truly forming the center of public opinion in the entire commune. In the early stage of the debate, a minority advocated planting early rice at eight-inch spacing (sparse planting), and a minority advocated dense planting at 6 × 3 inches and 6 × 4 inches. The majority advocated planting at six-inch spacing. Some well-to-do middle peasants were afraid that dense planting would require more labor. They only talked about the benefits of low-yield sparse planting and did not mention the benefits of high-yield dense planting. Some old farmers were also bound by empiricism and advocated sparse planting.

	Present the Facts and Reason Things Out

	At the debate meeting of the Pandun Production Team, the poor peasant Pan Silu disagreed with the eight-inch spacing proposed by Pan Daigui and others. He said, "A good horse doesn't eat the grass it has already passed. Last year, we changed the eight-inch spacing planting method and reduced the planting distance to 6 × 5 inches and 6 × 4 inches, achieving a great harvest of grain. This year, grain production must leap forward even more than last year, and the planting distance cannot go backward." Pan Zhongxi cited the fact that Pan Daigui had seen with his own eyes, saying, "Last year, there was one mu and one fen of early rice in the team, and the planting distance was 6 × 4 inches, with a yield of 1,050 jin per mu, while the average yield of the team's eight-inch spacing land was only more than 400 jin." The poor peasant Pan Gongzeng and the lower-middle peasant Pan Meihui also added that, generally, rice roots cannot extend more than three inches around, and eight-inch spacing is too wasteful of land and fertilizer. After several presentations of facts and careful calculations, Pan Daigui stopped insisting on eight-inch spacing. After hearing these clear facts at the meeting, the old farmer Pan Weizeng also wavered on planting at eight-inch spacing. After discussing it with his son at home, his son also encouraged him to learn from the advanced. So, he plucked up his courage and said at the third debate meeting: "Eight-inch spacing is outdated and no longer needed."

	At the debate meetings in Luozhou, Shangyang, Duyuan, and other fifteen brigades, they all presented facts and reasoned things out, proving that the understanding of those who advocated sparse planting was wrong. After this large-scale debate on dense planting throughout the commune, the vast majority of commune members agreed to implement dense planting at 6 × 3 inches and 6 × 4 inches. The commune members who had originally advocated sparse planting also changed their minds.

	Organize Comparative Experiments

	However, Lin Youcai, headed by the well-to-do middle peasant Lin Youtian, and Lin Zhiyou, Lin Chuanfu, Lin Zhiming, and other four people, still insisted on eight-inch spacing, emphasizing that this was the old rule of three generations. Lin Zhixiang and others who advocated 6 × 4-inch dense planting were full of fighting spirit and determined to compete with them. After research, the brigade branch decided to divide a plot of land into two sides: one side with eight-inch spacing and the other side with 6 × 4-inch dense planting, competing with each other. In the discussion of dense planting specifications, each team also decided to allocate three, five, eight, or nine mu to conduct various dense planting experiments such as 5 × 2 inches, 4 × 4 inches, and 4 × 2 inches to create experience and guide future production work.

	Mobilized the Enthusiasm of the Masses

	After the dense planting specifications were determined, everyone discussed other production increase measures. The entire commune now has three times more fertilizer than in the same period last year, with an average of 1,500 dan of fertilizer per mu. This year, water conservancy was well-repaired. On the basis of last year's systematization of water conservancy, drainage ditches were generally dug, and seventeen small-scale water conservancy projects were built, greatly facilitating irrigation and drainage. This year, the land was plowed early. All 14,000 mu of rice fields in the commune were plowed before the "Winter Solstice," reaching a depth of eight or nine inches in every plot, half an inch deeper than last year. Fertilizer accumulation and farming preparation started early, and there were sufficient seeds, giving confidence to sow in advance as appropriate. After analyzing the favorable conditions, the commune members had even greater confidence in dense planting. After careful calculations, comparing measures, and boosting morale, the targets set by each team generally exceeded the requirement of 3,000 jin per mu.

	Through this debate, the cadres further mastered the working methods of the mass line and established the style of consulting with the masses in case of problems. In particular, the increase production targets and measures were handed over to the masses for discussion, allowing the masses to formulate them themselves, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. In a few days, they contributed more than 7,000 suggestions. The commune members proactively raised the issue that the current fertilizer preparation was not adapted to the requirements of increased production. Therefore, at the same time as the dense planting debate, a vigorous new upsurge of accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer was launched. In four days, the entire commune accumulated and manufactured more than one million dan of fertilizer. Each production brigade sowed the first batch of seeds early, preparing to transplant seedlings early and striving for a bumper summer harvest.

    灯不拨不明　理不辩不清
    城门公社讨论增产规划
    本报福州2日电　福建闽侯县城门人民公社在2月上旬开展了一次以密植为中心的全民大辩论，这次辩论大大提高了社员的增产信心，他们自觉地订出了全年水稻保证亩产三千斤、力争四千斤的先进指标。水稻亩产三千斤的指标实现后，全公社今年粮食总产量可达到四千五百万斤，比1958年翻一番多。
      密植还是稀植？
    春节那天，中共福建省委第一书记叶飞等负责同志到城门公社潘墩大队，登门访问了农民过春节的情况，同时他还向社员们了解春耕准备工作情况。社员们说，今年翻土深，动手早，肥料比往年积得多。他们对今年农业大跃进表示信心很足。当叶飞同志询问今年早插稻秧密度时，在场的老农潘为增首先说，今年应该插八寸见方（稀植）。富裕中农潘代贵、潘玉贵立即支持他的意见。在场的社干部黄宝洛则主张5 ×2寸，军属潘作通赞同他的意见。在场的青年和妇女又还有另一些密植主张。叶飞同志看到这种情况，即向城门公社党委会建议，利用休假时间，在全公社开展一场密植大辩论，通过辩论，制定增产指标和措施。紧跟着一场大辩论就在全社十六个大队中有领导地展开了。这场历时五天的大辩论，贫农、下中农、富裕中农都参加了，真正形成全公社舆论的中心。鸣放初期，主张早稻插八寸见方稀植的是少数，主张插6×3寸、6×4寸密植的也是少数，主张插六寸见方的则是多数，部分富裕中农怕密植多花工，光说低产稀植的好处，不说密植高产的好处；有些老农民被经验主义束缚着，也主张稀植。
    摆事实，讲道理
    在潘墩生产队辩论会上，贫农潘思流不同意潘代贵等人提出的八寸见方作法。他说：“好马不吃回头草，去年我们改变了八寸见方插法，插秧距离缩小到6×5寸、6×4寸，取得了粮食大丰收。今年粮食要比去年更大跃进，插秧距离不能倒退回去。”潘仲西举出潘代贵亲眼见过的事实说：“队里去年有一亩一分早稻，插秧距离是6×4寸，亩产达到一千零五十斤，而队里八寸见方田地平均亩产只有四百多斤。”贫农潘公增、下中农潘梅惠也补充说，一般稻根向周围伸展不了三寸，八寸见方太浪费土地、浪费肥料了。经过几次摆事实，算细账，潘代贵也不坚持八寸见方了。老农民潘为增在会上听到这些鲜明事实后，对插八寸见方也动摇了，回到家里和他儿子一商量，他儿子也鼓励他学习先进，于是他鼓起了勇气。在第三次辩论会上说：“八寸见方是老皇历，用不着了。”
    在螺州、上洋、杜园等其他十五个大队的辩论会上，都通过摆事实说道理，证明主张稀植的人们的认识是错误的。全公社经过这场密植大辩论后，绝大部分社员都同意实行6×3寸、6×4寸密植，原先主张稀植的社员也纷纷改变了主张。
    组织对比试验
    但是城门大队以富裕中农林友天为首的林知佑、林传富、林知铭等四人，依然坚持八寸见方，强调这是三代老规矩。主张6×4寸密植的林知祥等多人斗志昂扬，决心和他们竞赛。大队支部研究后，决定划出一丘田，分成两边：一边是八寸见方，一边是6×4寸密植，相互竞赛。各队在讨论密植规格中，还决定每队都划出三、五亩或八、九亩搞5×2寸、4×4寸、4×2寸等多种多样的密植试验，以创造经验，指导今后生产工作。
    调动了群众积极性
    在密植规格确定后，大家又讨论了其他各项增产措施。全社现有肥料比去年同期翻三番，平均每亩有肥料一千五百担。今年水利修得好，在去年水利系统化的基础上，普遍挖了排水沟，并兴修了十七条小型水利，大大便利了灌溉排水。今年田地犁得早，全社一万四千多亩稻田在“冬至”前已犁完，丘丘达八、九寸深，比去年加深一半。积肥备耕动手早，种子足，有把握适当提早季节下种。经过分析有利条件后，社员们对密植的信心更加强了。经过算细账、比措施、鼓干劲，各队所订的指标，普遍超过亩产三千斤的要求。
    通过这场辩论，干部们也进一步掌握了群众路线的工作方法，树立了遇事和群众商量的作风，特别是增产指标和措施交给群众讨论，让群众自己制订，大大地调动了群众的积极性，在几天中他们共献计七千多条。社员们主动地提出了当前肥料准备尚不适应增产要求的情况，因此，在密植辩论的同时，就掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥造肥新高潮。在四天中，全社共积造肥料一百多万担。各个生产大队都提早播下第一批种子，准备提早插秧，力争夏季大丰收。
