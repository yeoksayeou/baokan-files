Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th — The Vietnam News Agency was authorized today to issue a statement strongly condemning the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for holding air force exercises in Thailand with units equipped with atomic weapons.

The statement said: Just as the people of the world are rising up to wage a resolute struggle, demanding the abolition of aggressive military blocs and the prohibition of nuclear weapons tests to ease world tensions, U.S. imperialism is using the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, this military bloc, to conduct air force war games with atomic equipment in Thailand, and is preparing to conduct naval exercises in the Far East. This is a blatant provocation against the countries of Southeast Asia. It increases the danger of a new war breaking out, which is posing a threat to the people of Asia and the world.

The statement said that U.S. imperialism has consistently conspired to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam and Laos, in order to drag South Vietnam and Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and turn this region into its military base for preparing to launch aggressive wars. At present, U.S. imperialism is instigating Thailand and South Vietnam to carry out subversive activities against Cambodia, threatening the independence of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and undermining the peaceful neutral policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The statement pointed out that the South Vietnamese and Lao authorities also sent "observers" to participate in the air force exercises held by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Thailand.

The statement said: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly protests against the war games held by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and demands the abolition of U.S. imperialism’s military bases and the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement concluded: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that in order to guarantee and safeguard peace in the Southeast Asian region, it is extremely necessary to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone of peace in the Far East and the Pacific region, which is in line with the strongest aspirations of the Vietnamese people and all the people of Asia.

    谴责东南亚集团举行战争演习
    新华社河内4日电　越南通讯社今天受权发表声明，强烈谴责东南亚条约组织在泰国举行有原子装备的部队参加的空军演习。
    声明说：正当全世界人民起来进行坚决斗争，要求取消侵略性军事集团和禁止核武器试验以缓和世界紧张局势的时候，美帝国主义却利用东南亚条约组织这个军事集团在泰国进行有原子装备的空军的战争演习，并且正在准备在远东地区进行海军演习。这是对东南亚各国的明目张胆的挑衅行为。它增加了发生正在对亚洲和世界人民造成威胁的新战争的危险。
    声明说，美帝国主义一贯阴谋破坏关于越南问题和老挝问题的日内瓦协定的履行，以便把南越和老挝拉入东南亚条约组织，并且把这个地区变成它的准备发动侵略战争的军事基地。目前，美帝国主义正在唆使泰国和南越对柬埔寨进行颠复活动，威胁柬埔寨王国的独立，破坏柬埔寨王国的和平中立政策。声明指出，南越和老挝当局也派了“观察员”，参加东南亚条约组织这次在泰国举行的空军演习。
    声明说：越南民主共和国坚决抗议东南亚条约组织举行的战争演习，并且要求取消美帝国主义的军事基地和解散东南亚条约组织。
    声明最后说：越南民主共和国认为，为了保证和维护东南亚地区的和平，在远东和太平洋地区建立一个无原子武器的和平地区是非常必要的，并且是符合越南人民和全体亚洲人民最强烈的愿望的。
