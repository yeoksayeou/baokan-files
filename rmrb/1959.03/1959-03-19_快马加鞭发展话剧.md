Spoken drama, this sharp artistic weapon, has played a tremendous role in China's national democratic struggle. After liberation, under more favorable working conditions, it has continued to serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, inspiring the people's production enthusiasm and fighting will. Last spring, a nationwide great leap forward in production was launched, and spoken drama, along with other brotherly opera genres, also put forward high creative targets and performance number targets. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of drama workers, these targets were largely completed or even exceeded. In the past, "May Fourth" era plays and foreign plays were performed more often. Last year, more plays reflecting the themes of modern life and struggle emerged. In the past, more attention was paid to the creation of theatrical art in big cities. Last year, there was a simultaneous emphasis on touring performances to bring the drama to the doorsteps of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, theatrical creation relied more on professional workers. Since last year, it has begun to combine with the booming mass art activities. In the past, drama workers were more accustomed to a narrow and pale artistic world. Last year, due to collective downshifting to participate in labor production in batches, the flowers of art came into contact with fresh and bright sunshine, air, and moisture, and grew more vigorously. In the past, actors playing workers and peasants did not look much like workers and peasants but more like intellectuals. Last year, due to eating, living, and working with workers and peasants, they understood their feelings and language, and the workers and peasants they played were more possessed of their spiritual outlook. In the past, the relationship between professional spoken drama troupes and the vast number of amateur troupes was not very close. Due to strengthened guidance, the level of mass amateur performance was improved, and the vitality of the professional troupes themselves was also enhanced. All of these are extremely valuable gains after the great leap forward last year, ensuring the possibility of a greater leap forward this year.

But can we be satisfied with the achievements we have already made? No! We are facing the higher requirements of the broad masses for spoken drama art, and we cannot fully answer these requirements. We still have many shortcomings.

Let's first mention the artistic shortcomings. People say: spoken drama actors are not very good at speaking, the sound is not clear, does not carry far, and lacks rhythm, etc.; they also say that our spoken drama actors have no skills, and their movements and positions are not accurate; spoken drama scripts are generally not as watchable as opera, and people don't want to watch them a second time. But we have both a uniquely styled opera tradition to inherit and advanced acting theories from brotherly countries to learn from, which are extremely favorable conditions for our development. Especially shortly after the founding of the country, the Soviet government, at our invitation, sent several drama experts to our country to engage in teaching performance, directing, and stage design, and directly guide our artistic practice, which greatly benefited us. Since then, we have had a more systematic understanding of the Stanislavski system, and our artistic level of performance and directing has improved significantly. But it is undeniable that our learning is far from deep and thorough. We did not simultaneously use scientific methods to study China's own artistic experience, raise it to a theoretical height, and establish our own national style of performance and directing. The spoken drama circle also took "Tiger Tally" as a starting point, triggering a wave of learning from tradition. Unfortunately, this attempt was not seriously persisted in, and it was generally limited to handling historical plays. How to use traditional methods to express modern life has been constantly mentioned, but little progress has been made.

As Comrade Wu Xue said: most spoken drama workers are "self-taught." Many people joined the spoken drama work during the War of Resistance Against Japan and National Salvation and have not received basic training in spoken drama art. Therefore, our performance is more of a simple imitation of life, without refining it into an artistic form that is truer, more beautiful, and more typical than life. This is unavoidable. You say that spoken drama actors can't speak well and have no skills, and we know it ourselves, but we can't wait to speak well, receive strict training, and then perform plays and resist Japan to save the country. At that time, we had to immediately take up the artistic weapon of spoken drama to awaken the people to fight the enemy. Spoken drama workers have always had abundant political enthusiasm and the desire to be close to the people. After the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," this desire became more clear and urgent. In our work, we naturally adopted some artistic measures that the masses understood and liked, which made our relatively clumsy spoken drama still possess strong appeal. It is unfair and incorrect to not pay attention to the achievements of this stage of artistic activity, or to completely regard it as something of naturalism, formulaization, and conceptualization. In the atmosphere of spoken drama standardization, many of us have looked down on this revolutionary tradition too much.

In today's socialist construction era, our art cannot stay at the previous stage. We can no longer excuse ourselves as "self-taught." We must change from being laymen to being professionals, from being rough to being exquisite. We cannot still not be able to speak well, have no skills, and the play is still not watchable after ten or twenty years. Of course, we have not wasted these great ten or twenty years. We have done a lot of work, and we have also made achievements in all aspects of spoken drama art. We cannot deny these achievements. We are just saying that these achievements are not enough, cannot meet the increasing demands of the people, have not reached the level they should have today, and some people are still not willing to watch our plays. This is the reality we must face squarely.

Secondly, let's talk about the shortcomings in ideological content. Many comrades think that they are politically in command ideologically, but they are just technically lacking. But this is not actually the case. Comrade Xia Yan said it well: today it is necessary to emphasize improving stage art, but the quality of our spoken drama scripts is also not high. It is not only that the artistic quality is not high, but it should also be said that there are still problems with the ideology. … We must not one-sidedly understand improving artistic quality as improving skills. Skills are very important and must be worked hard to improve, but at the same time, better transforming our ideology and more deeply participating in the lives and struggles of the people is a more fundamental issue.

In order to meet the cultural needs of the broad masses of the people, it is necessary to demand more plays and performances that highly combine ideological quality and artistic quality. As a member of the spoken drama workers, I urgently make the following "four more" suggestions to the spoken drama circle and to the literary and art comrades of the national spoken drama theaters and troupes:

	I. Write more good scripts
After all, the script is the basic condition for a good play. We do not have many professional playwrights, and they all have work, so they cannot devote themselves fully. Since the great leap forward last year, a large number of amateur writers have been mobilized to participate in playwriting. Some provinces have produced more than 10,000 spoken drama scripts. Last year, the number of scripts submitted to the Script Monthly reached 15,000, far exceeding previous years, of which spoken dramas accounted for more than one-third. These are mainly the works of young writers and the vast number of amateur writers, and the more excellent works have been published and performed successively. But in general, how to improve quality and carry out artistic processing is still a very serious issue.

As pointed out earlier, we require scripts with higher ideological content. Good plays can never be rigid political sermons, but should subtly influence the audience in artistic enjoyment, and should be a combination of education and entertainment.

In terms of the ideological aspect of the works, we must of course require a high level, but in terms of themes, forms, and styles, there is a vast field for writers to gallop. We welcome everyone to write about current major themes, but they do not necessarily have to be major themes. They can be a combination of large, medium, and small.

How to make spoken drama creation more vigorous? I think we should earnestly implement the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. There is also the issue of writing real people and real events in spoken drama creation. It is meaningful to reflect the current real struggle and portray the heroic figures of the contemporary era. In workshops, fields, construction sites, and barracks, it is also necessary to name names to praise achievements and criticize shortcomings in a timely manner. However, the protagonist being written and the people around him are generally very sensitive to the details of the script. For the convenience of typicalization, the author may attribute merit or fault to the characters; or in order to strengthen dramatic conflict, praise this character and suppress that character. Real people may not be real events, which cannot but cause controversy and disputes. Artistic characters should be more real than real people. The author's judgment of the characters should be the fairest. I think it is best to avoid using real names and surnames, so that the author can gain more initiative and be more convenient for typicalization.

Writing historical figures can of course be freer. Writing historical plays is not writing history, but it should also have a historical materialist spirit. Its praise and derogation should "shock the heavens and weep the ghosts and gods." Lightly making judgments will instead lose the due power of the work.

Clinging to the reality of life to write real people and real events is not necessarily realism, and it will also impose certain restrictions on the writer's creation. Typicalization based on real people and real events, highlighting heroic images with communist style, seeing tomorrow from today, here is revolutionary romanticism.

We must write people, write real people, people who are more real than real people. "Seeing events but not people" has been a common shortcoming of many scripts. The characters must stand up in the hearts of the audience, and their heroic behavior must shine brightly, so that they can arouse the audience to be moved and emulate them, and then the play will have a huge social effect.

On the other hand, there must also be stories, and moving stories, not arbitrarily fabricated false stories, but realistic, reasonable, and convincing stories. Only reasonable and convincing stories will be moving stories. Today, the general shortcoming of spoken dramas is often the lack of story. I also very much agree with Guo Lao's statement: "Audiences 'eat' stories. The reason why opera is popular with audiences is often because the story is moving, but spoken drama is not. Daily life is not the same as art. If spoken drama is just a few slices of daily life, then everywhere is a stage, and it doesn't cost money. Why should the audience spend money to buy tickets to come to your theater to watch spoken drama?" On the other hand, as spoken drama writers, many of us are students of Ibsen, and have absorbed nourishment from the torrent of modern drama. Therefore, comrades mostly regard spoken drama completely as a foreign form. But I personally have always believed that the original form of Chinese spoken drama art can be traced back to our Tang Dynasty's military plays. In terms of writing methods, we can and should learn from our own opera tradition, which contains valuable things common to our various opera genres. In the form of playwriting, I used to strictly abide by Ibsen's revived unities, and adopted the four-act and five-act form. Later, I began to use the multi-scene form, which is also commonly used by European and American playwrights. I myself like this form very much because I learned it from our opera art. I very much like the lively scenes of Chinese opera, which are not restricted by scenery, and arrive as soon as they are mentioned, freely and unrestrainedly. This is very suitable for expressing the huge scale and magnificent, colorful scenes of today's life struggle. In addition, Chinese opera also has its own unique techniques in portraying characters and developing plots, but we do not pay much attention to this. I agree with Comrade Wu Xue's view: "I feel that spoken drama is disconnected from our national artistic tradition. First of all, in terms of playwriting, opera has a set of methods for describing characters, directly to the point, highlighting the characters, with clear contradictions, long when there is a play, and short when there is no play; the selection of details is closely combined with the theme. However, our spoken drama is still stuck in writing events, seeing events but not people. The language is not as refined, accurate, and personalized as opera." This means that in terms of playwriting, in addition to learning from modern drama masters, we should also better learn from the traditional opera.

	II. Perform more good plays
To perform good plays, a good script is the most basic condition, but it also requires good directing and good actors. The three must cooperate very harmoniously. But the relationship between authors, directors, and actors has always been difficult to normalize. Directing is a new profession in China (in the past, China only had play narrators, and famous actors each had their own signature plays, and they themselves were often the directors of the play). According to foreign customs, his status is very high, and the selection and cutting of the script, the performance of the actors, and the entire stage work are all in his hands. Drama is a comprehensive art, and the art departments being integrated cannot engage in independence. Like an orchestra, the musicians of various instruments should obey a unified conductor. The position of the director as the unified conductor should be respected. But the director should also fully respect the playwright, actors, and stage workers, and pay attention to maintaining good relations with them. The new drama requires the playwright, director, actors, and stage artists to cooperate in a centralized and democratic way. The director must have a more serious and detailed study of the work. Through his overall artistic arrangement, he should give full play to the talents of the actors and the entire stage artists, and fully express the artistic conception and ideals required by the author. How fascinating is the close relationship between Stanislavski, Nemirovich-Danchenko, Chekhov, and Gorky!

Since the main key to improving spoken drama art is in the hands of the director, we cannot but expect them to establish a correct relationship between the playwright, actors, and all stage artists with the spirit of an orchestra conductor, and play a harmonious, powerful, and inspiring tune.

The purpose of maintaining good relations among the three is to jointly create a set of performance methods that are more suitable for the requirements of the script and more acceptable and loved by the audience. Chinese opera has its own complete set of methods, while spoken drama has been disconnected from tradition since the May Fourth Movement, and its learning from foreign countries is not enough. It was not until these years that it systematically learned the Stanislavski system, which has been a very good reference.

We say reference because any good things from foreign countries and the ancients can be used for observation and reference, but they cannot replace our own creation. I learned a lot during my visit to Moscow. I very much admire the fact that Stanislavski, after finding his own path, still humbly studied the creations of others, and he also invited dramatic artists of different styles and schools to lecture and direct at the Art Theater. Stanislavski's students also formed many different schools, some following Stanislavski's path in general, and some far away from it. At the same time, the Moscow drama circle does not exclusively worship Stanislavski, but rather rivers flow together and a hundred flowers bloom. I think this is also the artistic world that Stanislavski dreamed of. As a necessary process of learning the Stanislavski system, our spoken drama stage is too restrained and too conventional. The emotions are not unrestrained and vigorous enough, and the expression methods are not rich and colorful enough.

As Chinese dramatists, we have a full responsibility to seriously organize and summarize the rich artistic experience of our traditional opera, raise it to a theoretical height, find out the laws of Chinese opera art, and use it to educate ourselves.

Of course, it is not good to rigidly copy the things of the ancients or foreigners. It is certainly wrong to rigidly copy foreign things. Rigidly copying tradition and not being able to adapt to it will not establish a new national style. In April last year, Mr. Shen Chuan锟 in the Theatre Journal published “How I Direct Modern Operas”, which puts forward some useful experiences for critically learning traditional performance methods to express modern life. For example, combining the method of starting from the heart in spoken drama with the laws of opera: going from the heart to the external form and action, and then deeply understanding the inner activity from the external form and action; for example, applying the performance methods of expanding and beautifying actions and unifying singing, doing, reciting, and fighting in musical rhythm to modern plays; for example, in the design of physical movements, in order to make the movements lifelike and artistic, sometimes slightly modifying the old routines, sometimes applying them without modification, and sometimes innovating them all. His experience has also greatly inspired spoken drama artists on how to learn from and apply tradition. Recently, reading Mr. Yu Zhenfei's "Some Opinions on Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera Performing Modern Plays" (see the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on March 3), I also think it is very good. Mr. Yu pointed out that Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera actors must use traditional performance methods to perform modern plays, and must "create a set of performance methods suitable for modern plays on the basis of tradition." (He cited Li Shaochun's performance of Yang Bailao as an example, believing that he delved into the character's personality. Although he used many Peking Opera techniques, it looked very comfortable.) He reminded everyone "not to move certain routines of performing classical plays over without modification", saying that doing so "may turn modern plays into opera fan biographies!" This is a profound satire on the doctrinaire successors of traditional art.

Mr. Yu also said that relying solely on a set of traditional performance methods "can only make modern plays perform 'like', but cannot make modern plays perform 'well'." To perform modern plays well and lively, we must solve the relationship with the protagonists of modern plays, the workers, peasants, and soldiers and their advanced elements. We must master their thoughts and feelings, and be happy, angry, worried, and happy with them. Therefore, we must strengthen the ideological transformation of the actors. He advocated performing while transforming, and constantly "discovering problems, accumulating experience, eliminating the dross and selecting the essence" in continuous performances, and "exploring a set of performance methods that are relatively complete and can be accepted by everyone." These views are very correct and are worth learning from by spoken drama artists. Indeed, we must not only perform the heroic figures of the new era—workers, peasants, and soldiers—"like", but also perform them "well" and "lively." The older generation of artists had "living Zhao Yun," "living Cao Cao," "living Wu Song"... Today we must also have "living White-Haired Girl," "living Liu Hulan," "living Qu Yuan," "living Sifeng," "living Li Youguo," "living Shi Yang," and the like.

Therefore, we must have a repertoire that we never tire of watching, just like opera. The shaping of a heroic figure must go through the repeated efforts of the actors, carefully carving, repeatedly tempering. I was very moved to see Tarasova's "Marie Stuart" at the Moscow Art Theatre. Later, I visited the Theatre Museum and realized that this was a successful work of her predecessors. Tarasova is famous for playing "Anna Karenina." She is already in her sixties and has passed on her unique skills to her younger generation. Great art is accumulated over generations in this way. Magnificent buildings are not built on sand; we cannot be like bears breaking corn, breaking one and throwing it away; we cannot "write fast, perform fast, discard fast, and forget fast." We must allow future generations to obtain a rich artistic heritage from the stage, from libraries, and from museums that is enough to commemorate this era of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	III. Train more young actors
To train good young actors and accumulate artistic experience, we must maintain good inheritance relationships. Opera has teachers and apprentices, classes, and an apprentice system, while spoken drama does not. Spoken drama actors have always been mostly intellectuals. They do not take apprentices. Furthermore, in the past, it seemed that everyone could perform spoken drama, and it did not require too much specialized technology. Therefore, there was nothing to teach. But these are all things of the past. Today, we have schools that specialize in training spoken drama actors, directors, and stage artists. The central and provincial spoken drama troupes are also carrying out the work of training the next generation.

Some comrades lament that today many of the main actors in spoken drama theaters are "old soldiers." Some people also say that not enough playwrights, directors, and actors have been trained in the ten years since liberation. Currently, there is indeed such a state of discontinuity. This opinion is correct. I think it is also very good for theaters to have more "old soldiers." Art requires natural youth, but it cannot rely solely on natural youth. What is valuable is artistic youth. Tarasova, who was mentioned earlier, and Mei Lanfang in our country are both over sixty years old and have not retired from the stage. There are also opera stage performers like Mr. Zhang Guixuan and Gai Jiaotian who are over seventy or eighty years old and still ambitious. At the spoken drama performance last year, a Bulgarian dramatist asked us who the oldest spoken drama actor was. When he learned that the oldest of our spoken drama actors was only forty years old, he was somewhat disappointed. His intention was also to ask talented and cultivated spoken drama actors not to easily withdraw from the stage, so that audiences can see mature, "consummate" performances, and so that they can drive the growth of many young actors in artistic practice.

The Party requires quality in all economic construction and cultural construction, quantity that guarantees quality, and also requires a high speed. The same is true for developing dramatic art and training dramatic talents. We hope that more new talents will emerge in the spoken drama circle. I personally have seen many local opera genres and feel that it is not only the richness and diversity of the repertoires and performing arts they store that are enviable, but especially the emergence of many excellent young actors. I think that whichever opera genre cultivates more young actors has the most hope for development. Looking back at spoken drama, I feel that it is not as good in this regard.

In the past, it was unavoidable that actors lacked basic training and that their language and physical movements lacked skills. We also ask these art "old soldiers" who are approaching middle age not to think that they are no longer capable and that it is too late. They still have to learn, practice, and perform until they are old, just like opera actors. The training of young actors must be even more rigorous. First of all, spoken drama actors must be able to speak. This is not enough. They must also be able to do singing, doing, reciting, and fighting, like opera actors in general. Otherwise, learning from tradition will be empty talk. Students at the Central Academy of Drama learned Lou Ashu in "Fifteen Strings of Cash" from Wang Chuansong. Because they did not have basic training, the muscles on their faces would not move, and they could not turn over the bench. Comrade Wu Xue directed "Subduing Dragons and Tigers" and asked the actors to flip over from the table. The actors did not have this technical preparation and could not do it. But we should expedite things so that everyone can do it. We cannot be "self-taught" for the rest of our lives.

In addition, in addition to political study, there must also be a deeper literary cultivation. Many Soviet actors can even give specialized reports on poetry and novels.

	IV. Write more constructive criticism
Theoretical criticism is an important force in guiding and promoting the development of drama. To have good scripts and good performances, we cannot but expect good critical writing.

Of course, this does not mean that critics have to say good things about us without principle. Such criticism would instead poison art and hinder the progress of drama. We welcome serious, to-the-point but well-intentioned criticism.

Dramatic criticism in recent years has played a great role, but it cannot be denied that our critical work is still not done well enough. Comrade Ouyang Shanzun, using his written and oral criticisms of "Song of Youth," "Guan Hanqing," "Teahouse," and the recent "Revolutionary Family" as examples, believes that critics "do not do enough to promote new things and affirm good things." Some criticisms exaggerate the shortcomings too much and are not convincing. Others are easily described as "roads" and "directions." He believes that such criticism "is detrimental to the development and improvement of spoken drama art." Comrade Wu Xue also believes that some critics' writings and speeches are more inspired and rely on personal preferences, and do not better reflect the Party's policies on dramatic work. But he said: "There is still fair public opinion on some plays." I personally think that in terms of the situation of dramatic criticism since the Great Leap Forward, "fair public opinion" is still the main thing. In seminars or other occasions, it is inevitable to have different opinions on the same script or performance. Comments in newspapers and magazines are more cautious. Different views can be debated. In order to vigorously develop spoken drama and improve the quality of spoken drama a step further, we urgently await more "fair public opinion."

Editor's note: The words of Comrades Guo Moruo, Xia Yan, Wu Xue, Ouyang Shanzun, etc. in the article are quoted from the speeches at the "Discussion on the Development of Spoken Drama" seminar published in the fifth issue of the "Theatre Journal" this year.

    快马加鞭发展话剧
    田汉
    话剧这一新锐的艺术武器在中国民族民主斗争中起过巨大的作用。解放以后，在更顺利的工作条件下，继续为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，鼓舞着人民的生产热情和战斗意志。去年春天掀起了全国生产大跃进运动，话剧也和广大兄弟剧种一道，提出了很高的创作指标和演出场数指标。由于广大戏剧工作者冲天的干劲，这些指标大体完成甚至超额完成了。以前“五四”剧目和外国剧目演得较多，去年涌现了更多表现现代生活斗争题材的剧目；以前更多注意大城市剧场艺术的创造，去年同时强调了向各地巡回演出，把戏剧送上工农兵的门口；以前戏剧创作较多地依靠专业工作者，去年以来开始与轰轰烈烈的群众性艺术活动相结合；以前戏剧工作者较习惯于狭隘的苍白的艺术天地，去年由于分批集体下放参加劳动生产，使艺术的花朵接触新鲜爽朗的阳光、空气、水分，成长得更加有气力；以前演工人农民不大像工人农民而多像知识分子，去年由于与工人农民同吃、同住、同劳动，理解他们的感情和语言，演出来的工人农民较多具备他们的精神面貌；以前话剧专业剧团跟广大业余剧团的关系不太密切，由于加强了辅导，提高了群众业余演出水平，也增强了专业剧团自己的生命力。所有这些都是去年大跃进以后极可宝贵的收获，保证了今年更大跃进的可能性。
    但我们能不能满足于已有的成就呢？不能！我们面临着广大群众对话剧艺术更高的要求，我们还不能充分回答这些要求，我们还存在许多缺点。
    首先提提艺术的缺点吧。人们说：话剧演员还不大会说话，听不真，送不远，缺乏节奏感等等；又说我们话剧演员身上没有功夫，动作地位不准确；话剧剧本一般地没有戏曲那样耐看，看一次不再想看第二次。但我们既有具有独特风格的戏曲传统可以继承，又有兄弟国家先进的演剧理论可资借鉴，这是我们极为有利的发展条件。特别是建国后不久苏联政府应我们的约请，派遣了好些位戏剧专家来我国，从事表演、导演以及舞台装置的教学，并且直接指导我们的艺术实践，这使我们得到很大的益处；从此我们对斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系才有了较系统的理解，我们表演、导演的艺术水平才显著地有所提高。但无可讳言，我们的学习还是远不够深透的。我们没有同时用科学方法去研究中国自己的艺术经验，把它提到理论高度，建立自己的表演、导演的民族风格。话剧界也曾以“虎符”等为起点，引起向传统学习的热潮。可惜这种尝试也没有认真地坚持下去，而且一般地只限于处理历史剧目，怎样运用传统方法表现现代生活虽不断有人提到，但还进展不大。
    正如吴雪同志所说：话剧工作者多数是“半路出家”，许多人是在抗日救亡运动中参加话剧工作的，没有受过话剧艺术的基本训练，因此我们的表演更多的是对生活的素朴模仿，没有把它提炼成比生活更真、更美、更典型的艺术形式。这是不得已的。你说话剧演员不会说话，身上没有功夫，我们自己也知道，但我们不能等待说好话，受好严格训练，再来演戏，再来抗日救国。我们当时必须立即拿起话剧这一艺术武器，唤起人民跟敌人战斗。从来话剧工作者多有着充沛的政治热情和接近人民群众的要求，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，这种要求更为明确和迫切。我们在工作中很自然地采取一些使群众了解和喜爱的艺术措施，这样使我们较为拙稚的话剧仍具备强烈的感染力。对于这一段艺术活动的成绩不予重视，或全部把它都当作自然主义、公式化、概念化的东西加以否定，是不公平的，也是不正确的。在话剧正规化的风气中，我们有不少人过于看轻这个革命传统了。
    今天的社会主义建设时代，我们的艺术便不能老停留在以前的阶段，不能再以“半路出家”原谅自己，必须由外行变成内行，由粗糙进入精美。不能事隔十年二十年我们还不会说话，身上还没有功夫，戏还不经看。当然，这伟大的一、二十年，我们谁也没有白过，我们做了许多工作，我们在话剧艺术的各方面也都有所成就。不能否定这些成就。我们只是说这些成就还不够，还不能满足人民日益提高的要求，还没有达到今天应有的水准，还有人不太愿看我们的戏。这是我们必须正视的现实。
    其次，谈谈思想内容上的缺点。不少的同志以为自己思想上是政治挂帅了，只是技术上还差些。但实际上并不是这样。夏衍同志说得好：今天有必要强调一下提高舞台艺术，但我们话剧剧本的质量也不高。不单是艺术性不高，也应该说，思想性也还是有问题的。……决不能把提高艺术质量片面地理解为提高技巧。技巧很重要，必须努力提高，但在同时，更好地改造思想，更深入地参加人民群众的生活和斗争，却是一个更根本性的问题。
    为着满足广大人民的文化需要，必须要求有更多思想质量和艺术质量高度结合的剧作和演出。作为话剧工作者的一员，我迫切地向话剧界，向全国话剧院、团的文艺界同志们作以下“四多”的建议：
      一、多写好剧本
    剧本毕竟是戏演得好的基本条件。我们的专业剧作家不太多，又都有工作，并不能全力以赴。去年大跃进以来发动了大量业余作者参加剧作。有些省话剧剧本产量过万。去年投到剧本月刊的大小剧本就达一万五千个，远胜往年，其中话剧占三分之一强。这主要是青年作家和广大业余作者的创作，其中较优秀的作品已经先后刊出和上演。但一般地说如何提高质量，进行艺术加工，仍是十分严重的问题。
    正如前面所指出，我们要求思想性较高的剧本。好的戏永远不能是生硬的政治说教，而应当是在艺术享受中使观众潜移默化，应当是教育性和娱乐性的结合。
    在作品的思想方面，我们当然要要求具有高度的水平，但在题材、形式、风格等方面，却有着任作家驰骋的广阔原野。我们欢迎大家写当前重大题材，但也不一定是重大题材，可以大中小结合。
    如何使话剧创作更有生气，我看应当认真贯彻革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的原则。话剧创作上也存在写真人真事的问题。为了反映当前现实斗争，刻划同时代的英雄人物是有意义的。在车间、田头、工地、兵营，为了及时表扬功绩、批评缺点，提名道姓也有必要。但被写的主人公和他的周围人物对于剧本的细节一般非常敏感。作者为了典型化的便利，可能在人物身上归功、归过；或者为了加强戏剧冲突，对剧中人物扬此抑彼，真人未必真事，这就不能不引起争论和纠纷。艺术上的人物是应该比真人更真实的，作者对人物的评断应该是最公正的。我以为最好避免用真名实姓，作者更取得主动，更便于典型化。
    写历史人物当然可以自由些。写史剧不是写历史，但也应当有历史唯物主义精神，它的一褒一贬应当“惊天地，泣鬼神”，轻易臧否，反而会失去作品应有的威力了。
    拘泥于生活真实地写真人真事，实际不一定是现实主义，而且对作家的创作会有一定的束缚。以真人真事为基础加以典型化，突出具有共产主义风格的英雄形象，从今天看到明天，这里就有了革命的浪漫主义。
    我们一定要写出人，写出真正的人，比真人还要真实的人。“见事不见人”，这曾经是许多剧本的共同缺点。一定要人物在观众心里站起来，他的英雄行为光芒闪烁，才会引起广大人民感动效法，才会有剧作的巨大社会效果。
    另一方面也得有故事，而且是动人的故事，不是任意捏造的虚伪的故事，而是有现实性的合情合理、令人信服的故事。只有合情合理、令人信服的故事，才会是动人的故事。今天话剧的一般缺点常常是缺乏故事性。我也非常同意郭老的说法：“观众‘吃’故事。戏曲所以受观众欢迎，往往是因为故事动人，话剧则不是。日常生活不等同于艺术，如果话剧只是日常生活的几个切片，那么处处都是舞台，而且不要钱，观众何必还要出钱买票到你剧院来看话剧”另一方面，作为话剧作者，我们不少人都是易卜生的学生，从近代剧的洪流中吸取了营养，因此同志们多有把话剧完全看成外来形式的。但我个人一直以为中国话剧艺术的原始形式可以追溯到我们唐代的参军戏。在作剧方法上也可以而且应该向自己的戏曲传统学习，那里面包含着我们各剧种共同的宝贵的东西。在编剧的形式上以前我也严守过易卜生复活的三一律，采取四幕五幕的形式，后来开始运用多场景的形式，这种形式欧美剧作家也常用。我自己爱用这种形式却是从我们戏曲艺术学来的，我非常欢喜中国戏曲那种生动活泼的场子，不受布景的拘束，说到就到，纵横自在，这很适于表现今天生活斗争的巨大规模和波澜壮阔变化多彩的场面。另外在刻划人物、发展情节方面，中国戏曲也有其独特的手法，而我们对此不太注意。我同意吴雪同志的看法：“我感到，话剧跟我们的民族艺术传统脱了节。首先，在编剧方面，戏曲有一套描写人物的方法，单刀直入，人物突出，矛盾鲜明，有戏则长，无戏则短；细节的选择和主题结合的很紧。而我们的话剧还停留在写事件上，见事不见人。语言也不如戏曲那样精炼，准确，性格化。”这就是说在剧作方面我们除了向近代戏剧大师们学习之外，也应该更好地向传统戏曲学习。
      二、多演好戏
    要演出好戏，好剧本是最基本的条件，但还得导演好，演员好。得三者十分融洽的合作。但从来作者、导演、演员的关系是很难得正常的。导演在中国是一种新职业（以前中国只有说戏先生，名演员各有其看家剧目，他自己也常常是剧的导演），按外国的习惯，他的地位很高，剧本的取舍剪裁，演员的表演和整个舞台工作都掌握在他手里。戏剧是综合艺术，被综合的艺术部门不能闹独立性，像乐队一样，各种乐器的乐师应当服从一个统一的指挥。导演作为统一指挥员的地位是应当尊重的。但导演也应当十分尊重剧作者、演员和舞台工作者，注意搞好和他们的关系。新的戏剧正是要求剧作者、导演、演员、舞台艺术家又集中又民主的合作。导演必须对作品有更认真的细致的研究，通过他的总的艺术安排，发挥演员和整个舞台艺术家的才智，充分表达作者所要求的意境和理想。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基、聂米罗维奇·丹钦柯和契呵夫、高尔基的亲密关系是多么使人神往啊！
    话剧艺术的提高，主要关键既然操在导演手里，我们不能不期待他们以乐队指挥员的精神建立和剧作者、演员以及全体舞台艺术家间的正确关系，演奏出和谐雄健、震动人心的曲调。
    搞好三者关系的目的还是在于共同创造出一套更适合剧本要求，也更能被观众接受喜爱的表演方法。中国戏曲有他自己一套完整的方法，而话剧在五四以后既与传统脱节，学习外国也不够，直到这几年才较系统地学习了斯氏体系，才得到很好的借鉴。
    我们说借鉴，因为任何外国的，古人的好东西能供观摩参考，但却不能代替我们自己的创造。我在莫斯科访问中，学习了很多。我非常钦仰斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基在找到了自己的道路之后，还是那样虚心地研究别人的创造，而且他还邀请不同风格、不同流派的戏剧艺术家到艺术剧院讲学和导演。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的学生也形成许多不同的流派，有大体按着斯氏的道路走的，也有离得较远的。同时在莫斯科戏剧界也不是专崇斯氏，而是江河并流，百花齐放。我觉得这样也才是斯氏所寤寐以求的艺术世界。而作为学习斯氏体系的一个必经过程，我们的话剧舞台上就过于拘谨过于循规蹈矩，感情不够奔放泼辣，表现方法不够丰富多采。
    作为中国戏剧家，我们完全有责任来认真整理、总结我们传统戏曲的丰富的艺术经验，把它提到理论高度，找出中国戏曲艺术的规律，拿来教育自己。
    当然，一切硬搬硬套古人的或外国的东西都没有好处。硬搬外国的固然不对，硬搬传统，食古不化，也建立不了新的民族风格。去年4月间沈传锟先生在戏剧报发表“我怎样排演现代题材的戏曲”，对于批判地学习传统表演方法来表现现代生活，提出了几条有益的经验。如像把话剧从内心出发的方法跟戏曲规律相结合：从内心走到外形动作，又从外形动作深入体会内心活动；如像把富于抑扬顿挫的念白，扩大、美化的动作和唱、做、念、打统一在音乐节奏之中等表演方法应用到现代剧中；如像在形体动作的设计上，为了使动作生活化、艺术化有时小小修改旧程式，有时原封不动地应用，有时全部创新。他这些经验对于话剧艺术家如何学习传统，运用传统也有很大的启发。最近读俞振飞先生“对昆曲和京剧表演现代剧的几点意见”（见3月3日上海文汇报），也觉得很好。俞先生指出昆曲京剧演员要运用传统表演方法演出现代剧，得在传统基础上“创造出一套适合于现代剧的表演方法来。”（他举李少春演杨白劳为例，认为他深入人物性格，虽用了许多京剧技法，看上去却很舒服。）他提醒大家“不能把表演古典剧的某些程式原封不动地搬过来”，说那样“就可能把现代剧演成戏迷传！”这是对于传统艺术的教条主义继承者的深刻讽刺。
    俞先生又说，单凭一套传统表演方法“仅仅能把现代剧演‘像’，而不能把现代剧演‘好’”，要把现代剧演好、演活，得解决跟现代剧的主人公工农兵及其先进分子的关系问题。得掌握他们的思想感情，随着他们的喜而喜，怒而怒，忧而忧，乐而乐。因此，必须加强演员的思想改造。他主张边改造边演出，在不断演出中“发现问题，累积经验，去芜存菁”，“摸索出一套比较完整，比较能够为大家所接受的表演方法。”这些看法是非常正确的。很值得话剧艺术家们借鉴。的确，我们不只要把新时代的英雄人物——工农兵演得“像”，而且要演得“好”，演得“活”，前辈艺术家有“活赵云”，“活曹操”、“活武松”……我们今天也得有“活白毛女”、“活刘胡兰”、“活屈原”、“活四凤”、“活李有国”、“活施洋”之类。
    因此我们一定得跟戏曲一样有百看不厌的保留节目，一个英雄人物的塑造得经过演员们再三反复的努力，精雕细琢，千锤百炼。在莫斯科艺术剧院看过塔拉索娃的“玛利·斯迪幼瓦特”非常感动，后来参观戏剧博物馆才知道这是她的前代艺人成功之作。塔拉索娃是以演“安娜·卡列尼娜”有名的，她已经六十多了，又把她的绝艺传给她的后辈。伟大的艺术就是这样经过祖孙代代长期积累而成的，琼楼玉宇不建立在浪淘沙上；不能像狗熊掰棒子，掰一个，扔一个；不能“写得快，演得快，丢得快，忘得快”。一定得让子孙们从舞台、从图书馆、博物馆获得足以纪念这个社会主义革命和社会主义建设时代的丰富的艺术遗产。
    三、多培养青年演员
    要培养好青年演员，要积累艺术经验，必须搞好继承关系。戏曲有师承有科班，有徒弟制度，而话剧没有。话剧演员历来多是知识分子，他们不带徒弟，再说，以前似乎觉得话剧人人能演，也不需要太多的专门技术，因此也没有什么可以教给人的。但这些都是以前的话了。于今我们有专门培养话剧演员、导演和舞台美术家的学校，中央以及各省话剧院团也都在进行培养下一代的工作。
    有的同志慨叹于今天许多话剧院的主要演员都是些“老兵”了，也有人说解放后十年来还没有培养出足够的编剧、导演和演员。目前确是有这样青黄不接的状态。这意见是正确的。我觉得剧院多一些“老兵”也有很大好处。艺术要求自然的青春，但也不能单凭自然的青春，可贵的是艺术的青春。前面提过的塔拉索娃和我国的梅兰芳都是六十岁以上的人了，还没有退出舞台，戏曲舞台上也还有像张桂轩、盖叫天先生那样年过七八十还雄心勃勃的。前年话剧会演时保加利亚一位戏剧家问我们哪一位是最老的话剧演员，及至知道我们话剧演员最老的不过四十来岁，他有些失望。他的意思也是要求有才能有修养的话剧演员不要轻易退出舞台，一者使观众看到成熟的、“炉火纯青”的演出，二者可以在艺术实践中带动许多青年演员成长。
    党对于一切经济建设、文化建设都要求质量，要求保证质量的数量，也要求很高的速度，对发展戏剧艺术和培养戏剧人才也是一样。我们希望话剧界出现更多的新人才。我个人看过很多地方剧种，觉得不只是它们储藏的剧目和表演艺术的丰富多彩使人羡慕，尤其难得的是出现了好多优秀的青年演员，我以为哪一个剧种培养青年演员多，它就最有发展希望。反过来看话剧就觉得有不如之感了。
    过去，演员缺乏基本锻炼，语言和形体动作没有工夫是不得已的，我们还要求这些已近中年的艺术“老兵”们不要以为自己不行了，太迟了，还得跟戏曲演员一样，学到老，练到老，演到老。对青年演员的训练就要更加严格。首先，话剧演员必须会说话。这还不够，还得和戏曲演员一样大体做到唱、做、念、打俱全。不然，向传统学习便是一句空话。中央戏剧学院学员跟王传松学“十五贯”里的娄阿鼠，由于没有基本训练，脸上肌肉不会动，也翻不下板凳。吴雪同志导演“降龙伏虎”，要求演员从桌子上翻下来，演员没有这项技术准备，办不到。但该加紧让大家办得到了，我们不能一辈子“半路出家”了。
    此外，除了政治学习外还必须有较深的文学修养。苏联好些演员甚至能做关于诗歌小说的专门报告。
    四、多写建设性的评论
    理论批评是指导和推动戏剧发展的重要力量。要有好剧本、好演出，不能不期待好的批评文字。
    当然不是说，批评家得无原则地替我们说好话，那样的批评反而是毒害艺术，阻碍戏剧前进的。我们欢迎严正的，击中要害但与人为善的批评。
    近年来的戏剧批评是起了很大作用的，但是也不能否认，我们的批评工作还做得很不够。欧阳山尊同志以对“青春之歌”、“关汉卿”、“茶馆”以及最近的“革命的一家”等的文字和口头的批评为例，认为批评家“提倡新生的东西，肯定好的不够”，有些批评过于夸大缺点，不能服人，对另一些又轻易说成是“道路”、“方向”。他认为这样的批评“对话剧艺术的发展和提高都是不利的”。吴雪同志也认为有些批评家的文字和发言灵感式的多一些，凭个人好恶，没有更好地体现党对戏剧工作的政策。但他说：“对有些戏还是有公正的舆论的”。我个人以为就大跃进以来的戏剧评论情况说，“公正的舆论”还是主要的。在座谈会或其他场合，对于同一个剧本或演出见仁见智，是难免的。报纸杂志上的评论文字就比较慎重些，不同的看法可以展开争论。为了大力发展话剧，把话剧质量提高一步，我们迫切期待更多的“公正舆论”。
