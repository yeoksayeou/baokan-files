Spring Sunshine Shines Across the Land; Brotherly Countries Engage in Timely Spring Plowing
Strive for a New Great Harvest in Agricultural Production
Spring Plowing and Sowing Begins in Rural Areas Across the Soviet Union

    This dispatch reports that with spring gradually arriving across the vast Soviet lands, rural areas everywhere are actively engaged in spring plowing and sowing with great enthusiasm, striving for a new great harvest on the agricultural production front in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan.

    In southern Soviet Union, spring arrived earlier this year than in previous years. Many regions have long completed their preparations for spring plowing and sowing, and are now actively engaged in these activities.

    Many collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic have already sown their first batches of seeds.

    In the granaries of the Russian Federation – the Krasnodar and Stavropol Territories, as well as some farms in the Kubyshev and Rostov regions – field work has already begun. In the eastern farming regions of the Russian Federation, such as Altai and Siberia, although thick snow has not yet melted, collective farms and state farms have already begun field preparations.

    In the Tajik Republic, farms in the southern regions have already sown crops such as wheat and barley, and are now beginning to sow corn. This year, many farms in this republic plan to double their corn planting area.

    In the coastal regions of eastern Soviet Union, spring has also arrived particularly early this year. Farms in the southern zones have already begun spring fertilizing, and some areas have even begun sowing early spring crops. Such early sowing is rare in the coastal regions.

    Spring plowing and sowing are also actively underway in the Kyrgyz Republic, where most collective farms have already begun sowing wheat and oats. Many regions have already completed the sowing of perennial grasses.

    In the Kazakh Republic, preparations for spring plowing are actively underway. This year, four-fifths of the republic's total cultivated land will be used to plant wheat, and more than 70% of the cultivated land will be sown with high-quality seeds. Workers on state farms and members of collective farms in this republic are guaranteeing to increase the grain yield per hectare by three to four quintals compared to previous years. This will increase the republic's grain production from 1.3 billion poods last year to 1.5 billion poods.

Striving by Every Means to Achieve a Bumper Harvest of Early Spring Crops
Korean Farmers Deep Plowing and Close Planting
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 16th: Spring has arrived in northern Korea, and the land is beginning to thaw. After completing agricultural cooperativization and engaging in large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation last winter and this spring, Korean farmers are now investing in a spring plowing and sowing upsurge ahead of schedule with unparalleled confidence and high enthusiasm.

    In the warmer western coastal areas, tractor stations in South Hwanghae Province and North Pyongan Province began spring plowing from the beginning of March. The spring plowing at the Chongdan Tractor Station is more than twenty days ahead of previous years, and it has already plowed more than 250 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu). Before the start of spring plowing this year, tractor stations in various regions had made full preparations for deep plowing, so they have been able to deep plow to 30 cm smoothly after the start of spring plowing. The tractor stations in Yonan, Paechon, and Ryongyon counties in South Hwanghae Province are guaranteeing this spring to deep plow 30 cm two to three times on 100,000 chongbo of land.

    At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have begun sowing early spring crops. South Pyongan Province aims to complete the sowing of spring wheat, potatoes, and beans before the end of March. This year, Korean farmers have implemented deep plowing and deep turning of the soil in order to strive for a bumper harvest of early spring crops, and they have applied about 100 tons of fertilizer per chongbo of land. Close planting is implemented during sowing, with some sowing 300 kilograms of wheat seeds per chongbo of land. Because irrigation area has been expanded by 350,000 chongbo in various regions of Korea last winter and this spring, many early spring crops can be irrigated, making a bumper harvest even more guaranteed.

Czechoslovak Farmers Actively Carry Out Spring Plowing and Sowing
Spring Grains Sown on More Than 60,000 Hectares of Land

    This dispatch from Prague, March 16th, reports that spring has arrived in Czechoslovakia, and farmers everywhere are actively carrying out spring plowing and sowing. As of the 8th, they had sown spring grains on more than 63,000 hectares of land, a figure that was not reached until a full month later, April 8th, last year.

    In the hilly and mountainous regions, sowing, fertilizing, and other field preparations are also underway. To date, Slovakia has made great progress, where spring grains have been sown on more than 40,000 hectares of land.

    Cooperatives in various states of the Czech region have completed spring sowing on 15,000 hectares of land, while state farms have completed spring sowing on more than 8,000 hectares of land. In order to ensure that animal husbandry can obtain sufficient feed, various regions are also sowing mixed feed crops and fertilizing grasslands and pastures.

    One of the reasons why spring field work in agricultural cooperatives is progressing faster than last year is that they have purchased many tractors and machines from machine and tractor stations. Cooperatives have purchased a total of more than 6,000 tractors and a large number of seeders, potato planters, and other agricultural machines.

Determined to Double This Year's Grain Production
Bulgarian Agricultural Cooperative Members March Toward the Land
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: Although the cold air of late winter is still assaulting people, the members of Bulgarian agricultural production cooperatives, determined to double this year's grain production, have enthusiastically started spring plowing and sowing activities. From February 24th to March 3rd alone, the country has sown approximately 1.4 million decares (one decare is equivalent to 1.5 mu) or more of oats, peas, sunflowers, and beets.

    This year, Bulgaria plans to sow spring crops on a total area of 24 million decares, equivalent to about half of Bulgaria's total cultivated land area. Moreover, more than half of this will be deep plowed to 30 cm or more.

    While spring sowing is underway, agricultural production cooperatives have also launched topdressing for overwintering crops and soil compaction to preserve moisture. Currently, topdressing with chemical fertilizers has been completed on 5.26 million decares of overwintering crops nationwide, and soil compaction has been carried out on 230,000 decares. Members of Bulgarian agricultural production cooperatives are determined to transform more than 2 million decares of dry land into irrigated land and turn 2.5 million decares of wasteland and vacant land into cultivated land this year. In order to complete this task, many places are currently launching shock month movements to build water conservancy projects and reclaim new cultivated land.

    万里春光普照大地　兄弟国家及时春耕
    争取在农业生产上来个新的大丰收
    苏联各地农村开始春耕春播
    本报讯　广大的苏联土地上春意渐浓，各地农村正在以热火朝天之势积极进行春耕春播工作，争取在七年计划的头一年在农业生产战线上来一个新的大丰收。
    在苏联南部，今年春天比往年来得早，许多地区的春播春耕准备工作早就作好，现在正在积极进行春耕春播。
    在乌克兰共和国的许多集体农庄已经播下了第一批种子。
    俄罗斯联邦南部的粮仓——克拉斯诺达、斯达夫罗波尔边疆区以及古比雪夫、罗斯托夫等州的部分农庄已经开始田间劳动。在俄罗斯联邦的东部耕种区阿尔泰、西伯利亚等地，虽然厚厚的积雪未化，可是集体农庄和国营农场已经开始了田间的准备工作。
    在塔吉克共和国，南部地区的农庄已经播下了小麦、大麦等作物。现在正在开始播种玉蜀黍。今年，这个共和国的许多农庄都打算把玉蜀黍的播种面积扩大一倍。
    在苏联东部沿海地区，今年春天也来得特别早。南部地带的农庄已经展开了春耕施肥工作，有的地方已经开始了播种早春作物。这样早就播种，在沿海地区来说还是罕见的事。
    吉尔吉斯共和国的春耕、春播工作也正在积极进行中，这里大多数的集体农庄已经开始播种小麦和燕麦。很多地区已经结束了播种多年生草的工作。
    在哈萨克共和国，春耕工作已在积极准备进行。今年这个共和国的全部耕地的五分之四将用来种小麦，而70％以上的耕地也将播种优质的种子。这个共和国的国营农场工人和集体农庄庄员保证要使每公顷土地的谷物产量比往年增产三到四公担。这样，这个共和国的粮食产量将由去年的十三亿普特增为十五亿普特。
    千方百计争取早春作物丰产
    朝鲜农民深耕密植
    新华社平壤16日电　春天已经来到朝鲜北部，大地开始解冻。朝鲜农民在完成了农业合作化并且在去冬今春大搞水利和积肥之后，又以无比的信心和高涨的热情提前投入春耕、春播热潮。
    在暖得较早的西海岸地区，黄海南道、平安北道等地的拖拉机代耕站，从3月初就开始了春耕。青丹代耕站的春耕工作比往年提前二十多天，现在已经耕了二百五十多町步（一町步约合十五亩）。在今年春耕开始前，各地拖拉机代耕站都为深耕作好了充分准备，因此在春耕开始后，都很顺利地能够深耕三十公分。黄海南道的延安、白川、龙渊等地的代耕站今春保证要在十万町步的土地上深耕三十公分两次到三次。
    同时，各地农业社开始了早春作物的播种。平安南道要在3月底以前完成春麦、马铃薯和豆类的播种。今年朝鲜农民为了争取早春作物的丰产，都实行了深耕和深翻土地，并在每町步土地上施肥一百吨左右。在播种时实行密植、有的在一町步土地上播下三百公斤麦种。由于去冬今春朝鲜各地扩大了三十五万町步的灌溉面积，许多早春作物都能进行灌溉，使得丰收更加有保证。
    捷农民积极展开春耕播种
    已在六万多公顷土地上播种了春季谷物
    本报布拉格16日电　春天已经降临到捷克斯洛伐克，各地农民正在积极展开春耕播种的工作。到8日为止，他们已在六万三千多公顷的土地上播种了春季谷物，这个数字在去年是在整整一个月以后——4月8日才达到的。
    在丘陵和山岳地区，播种、施肥以及田间的其他准备工作也在进行中。到目前为止，斯洛伐克已经取得了极大的进展，在那里，四万公顷以上的土地上已播种了春季谷物。
    捷克地区各州的合作社已在一万五千公顷土地上完成了春播工作，国营农场则在八千公顷以上的土地上完成了春播工作。为了保证畜牧业能得到足够的饲料，各地还在播种混合饲料作物以及在草地和牧场上进行施肥的工作。
    农业合作社的春季田间工作进行得比去年较快的原因之一是：它们从机器拖拉机站购买了许多拖拉机和机器。合作社总共已购买到六千多台拖拉机和大批的播种机、马铃薯种植机以及其他农业机器。
    决心要把今年粮食产量翻一番
    保农业社员向大地进军
    新华社索非亚讯　冬末的寒气虽然还在袭人，可是下决心把今年粮食增产一倍的保加利亚农业生产合作社的社员们已经热火朝天地开始了春耕、春播的活动。仅仅从2月24日到3月3日期间，全国就已播种了约一百四十万狄卡尔（一狄卡尔相当于一点五市亩）以上的燕麦、豌豆、向日葵和甜菜。
    今年，保加利亚计划播种的春播作物的总面积将达二千四百万狄卡尔，相当于保加利亚全部耕地面积的一半左右。而且其中一半以上将进行深耕三十公分以上。
    在春种的同时，农业生产合作社还展开了给越冬作物追肥和压地保墒工作。目前，全国已有五百二十六万狄卡尔的越冬作物完成了化肥追肥工作，并且压地二十三万狄卡尔。保加利亚农业生产合作社社员们决心要在今年把二百万狄卡尔以上的旱地变成水浇地，把二百五十万狄卡尔荒地和空地变成耕地。为了完成这一任务，目前很多地方都展开了兴修水利和开垦新耕地的突击月运动。捷克斯洛伐克波希米亚南部农业合作社的社员们正在播种春麦。捷克斯洛伐克通讯社稿（新华社发）
