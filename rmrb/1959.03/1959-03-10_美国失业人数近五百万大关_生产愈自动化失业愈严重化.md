    US Unemployment Nears Five Million Mark
    Increased Automation in Production Leads to More Severe Unemployment
    (Reported by our newspaper) While the US President and some US newspapers are making every effort to promote the so-called "prosperity" that is about to arrive, the US unemployment problem is worsening.
    Last November, the official total number of unemployed in the US was 3.8 million, which increased to more than 4.1 million in December. In January of this year, it increased by another 610,000, reaching 4,724,000, an increase of 230,000 compared with the same month last year, creating the highest January unemployment figure since 1942. It is generally estimated that the unemployment figure for February will break through the five million mark. The most serious aspect is that the proportion of those who have been unable to find work for a long time has remained at one-third of the unemployed, showing no signs of decreasing.
    In major industrial centers in the United States, unemployment is particularly severe. According to a report in the British "News Chronicle" on March 3, in Detroit, the center of the US automobile industry, "one in ten residents is currently receiving food under the Federal Surplus Commodity Donation Program." The number of unemployed in this city has accounted for 12% of the city's labor force. This is more than double the standard set by the US federal government that an area with unemployment accounting for 6% of the labor force is considered a "severely depressed area." The number of people receiving relief in Detroit has doubled compared to a year ago, so that the city's funds were already insufficient to pay February's relief, and this month it has had to turn to the state government for help.
    In Pennsylvania, known as "America's Ruhr," the number of unemployed in January reached 508,000, accounting for 10% of the state's total labor force. This figure is 20% higher than the same period last year. According to the US Department of Labor, among the 149 major industrial areas in the United States, 76 areas have serious unemployment, and another 183 small industrial areas also have extremely serious unemployment.
    Why is unemployment getting worse when the industrial production index officially released by the United States is rising? In answering this question, the British "News Chronicle" wrote that this is because American "manufacturers did not rehire workers when the recovery began, but instead reduced workers and massively implemented overtime work, or turned to automation." In addition, the major US companies' "millions of dollars worth of computer equipment installed after the war could not be used before laying off workers during the recession. Now these new factories are greatly increasing productivity without hiring unemployed workers."
    The newspaper predicted that in April, "when 320,000 unemployed people across the United States have exhausted their normal unemployment benefits and are no longer eligible for federal (government) special benefits, the problem will become more serious."
    On March 2, the US "National Guardian" also reported that the rapid increase in automation and mechanization in US industry is increasing the number of unemployed. Last December, General Motors and Ford produced 60,000 more cars than in the same period of the previous year, but employed more than 33,000 fewer workers.
    The magazine said that the vast number of unemployed are struggling. Unemployed workers in Detroit have formed a delegation to demand that workers strive for a 30-hour work week with 40 hours' pay; extend the duration of unemployment benefits, including the entire duration of unemployment; prohibit overtime work; and that trade unions should fully support unemployed workers in the form of large-scale demonstrations. Under this strong pressure, AFL-CIO Vice President Reuther had to suggest that he lead a large-scale procession of unemployed workers to Washington to petition. However, this proposal has been rejected by the AFL-CIO's recent meeting in San Juan. The meeting only agreed to hold a "mass meeting" of the unemployed this spring. (Attached picture)

### 美国失业人数近五百万大关  生产愈自动化失业愈严重化

    美国失业人数近五百万大关
    生产愈自动化失业愈严重化
    本报讯　当美国总统和美国的一些报刊在竭力宣传所谓“繁荣”就要到来的时候，美国失业问题却愈演愈烈了。
    去年11月美国官方发表的全失业人数是三百八十万，12月增加到四百一十万以上，今年1月份又增加了六十一万而达到四百七十二万四千人，比去年同月增加了二十三万人，创造了1942年以来1月份失业人数的最高纪录。一般估计2月份失业数字将突破五百万大关。而最严重的是，在失业者中，长期找不到工作的人一直保持三分之一的比例，毫无缩减迹象。
    在美国各大工业中心，失业现象特别严重。据3月3日英国“新闻纪事报”报道，在美国汽车工业中心的底特律市，目前“每十个居民中就有一个在根据联邦剩余物资赠送计划，领取粮食。”这个城市的失业人数已占了全市劳动力的12％。以上这比美国联邦政府所规定的失业占劳动力6％的地区就属于“严重萧条区”的标准，要超过一倍。底特律市领取救济金的人比一年前增加了一倍，以致该市在发2月份的救济金时经费就已经不敷，本月份已不得不转而要求州政府帮助。
    在号称“美国的鲁尔区”的宾夕法尼亚州，1月份的失业人数达到五十万八千人，占全州劳动力总数的10％。这个数字比去年同时期要多20％。据美国劳工部宣布，现在美国全国一百四十九个大工业区当中，有七十六个地区存在着严重的失业状况，另外还有一百八十三个小工业区失业状况也极为严重。
    为什么在美国官方发表的工业生产指数回升的时候，失业反而更严重呢？英国“新闻纪事报”在回答这个问题时写道，这是因为美国“制造商在复苏开始时并没有复雇工人，反而减少工人和大量实行超时工作，或是转向实行自动化。”另外，美国各大公司“在战后设立的价值千百万美元的机器脑装备，在萧条期间解雇工人以前是无法采用的。现在这些新工厂正在大大提高生产率而不雇用失业工人。”
    这家报纸预言，在4月份“当美国全国的三十二万失业者领完正常的失业补助金，而也不再有资格领取联邦（政府）特别补助金的时候，问题就会更严重起来”。
    3月2日美国“国民前卫报”也报道说，美国工业中迅速增加的自动化和机械化使失业者更为增加。去年12月，通用汽车公司和福特汽车公司比前年同期多生产了六万辆汽车，但雇用的工人减少了三万三千多人。
    这家杂志说，广大的失业者正在进行斗争。底特律的失业工人组成了代表团要求工人争取每周工作三十小时，按四十小时付工资；延长失业补助金时间，包括整个失业时间；禁止超时工作；工会应以大规模示威形式全面支持失业工人。在这种强大的压力下，劳联—产联副主席洛德不得不建议，由他率领失业工人大规模地列队前往华盛顿请愿。但是这个建议已经被劳联—产联最近在圣胡安举行的会议所拒绝。这个会议只同意今年春季举行一次失业者的“群众大会”。（附图片）
