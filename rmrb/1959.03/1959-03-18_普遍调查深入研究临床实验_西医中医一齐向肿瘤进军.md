Extensive Investigation, In-depth Research, Clinical Trials:
Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine Join Forces to Combat Tumors

    (Our report) Our country's anti-cancer work has made considerable progress in areas such as investigation and research, prevention, and treatment, and has already achieved some results.

    Cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in our country, accounting for approximately 54% of all female cancers. To prevent and treat cervical cancer, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Hospital began conducting a general survey of women aged 30 to 36 in the Dongcheng District of Beijing in August last year, as a pilot project for a city-wide survey. Among the 2,712 women examined, the incidence of cervical cancer was 0.88%. Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Bureau of Public Health, the Beijing survey work was subsequently expanded to residential areas of 100,000 people. Cancer prevention surveys have also been carried out successively in Shanghai, Chengdu, and other places.

    In order to study the causes of cancer in our people and to seek prevention and treatment methods, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has compiled statistics on all tumor cases at the hospital over the past 40 years, totaling more than 27,000 cases. It has also researched cervical cancer cases and proposed new grading methods. In other parts of the country, many meaningful anti-cancer activities have also been carried out. For example, the Shanghai First Medical College analyzed and statistically analyzed more than 47,000 tumor cases from 220,000 pathological biopsy tissue examinations, providing valuable materials.

    Since the National Conference for the Exchange of Experiences in the Technical Revolution in Medicine and Health last autumn, many hospitals have adopted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, etc. For example, Beijing Tumor Hospital and Fuwai Hospital use acupuncture to treat esophageal cancer, and Shanghai uses "Xiaoliu Wan" pills to treat esophageal cancer. In general, there has been improvement to varying degrees. The symptoms of difficulty in swallowing have disappeared, and nutritional status has improved as a result. Beijing Tumor Hospital also uses prescriptions from Chengdu, Dezhou, Dalian, and other places to treat cervical cancer, which can also alleviate some symptoms. By the end of last year, many units in China had already begun research on clinically effective Chinese medicines such as Shennong Wan and Guanguanlang San. It can be affirmed that traditional Chinese medicine has a certain curative effect on some malignant tumors.

    Last autumn, Beijing Tumor Hospital was the first in China to use cobalt therapy for radiation treatment. Currently, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhan, Nanchang, and other places are also using cobalt therapy.

    In terms of experimental tumor treatment, the Institute of Experimental Medicine and the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences used in vivo methods to examine the anti-cancer effects of 153 TCM compound prescriptions and 88 single prescriptions. The results showed that a total of eight drugs had an inhibition rate of more than 50% on animal tumor growth, and they are currently being promoted for clinical use.

    The Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted in-depth research on actinomycin K and is currently undergoing clinical trials. The Institute of Antibiotics of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has also found antibiotics that inhibit cancer cells, which have been proven to have significant efficacy against animal tumors.

    In the serum therapy research of experimental tumors, the Department of Biochemistry of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, using mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma as the object, initially extracted relatively pure antigens (i.e., foreign substances that can induce antibody production in the body). Anti-cancer immune serum prepared by immunization has also been preliminarily observed to have curative effects on cancer, especially on early-stage cancer. For example, the life of mice inoculated with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma can be extended from the usual ten days to twenty-four days.

    The Department of Experimental Morphology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has performed allogeneic transplantation of malignant tumors in more than 250 people. Currently, neurofibrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and esophageal cancer have been passed down to the third generation in white rats, but permanent tumor strains have not yet been obtained. The Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai is also carrying out this work, and their fibrosarcoma has been passed down to the third generation.

    The Department of Experimental Morphology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has done tissue cultures of 125 human tumors. One case of neurofibrosarcoma has been passed down to the eleventh generation in vitro, and one case of chondrosarcoma and one case of fibrosarcoma have been passed down to the fourth generation, but epithelial malignant tumors have not yet been successful.

    Due to the Party's emphasis on the prevention and treatment of tumors, a hospital with modern equipment dedicated to admitting tumor patients has been established in Beijing, a tumor research institute has been established in Shanghai, and tumor research committees have been established in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. At present, our country's cancer prevention and experimental research work has been rapidly developed.

### 普遍调查深入研究临床实验  西医中医一齐向肿瘤进军

    普遍调查深入研究临床实验
    西医中医一齐向肿瘤进军
    本报讯　我国的抗癌工作，在调查研究、预防和治疗等方面，进行了不少工作并已经取得一些成绩。
    子宫癌是我国妇女的癌瘤中最多见的一种，约占妇女所有癌瘤的54％。为了防治子宫癌，中国医学科学院、北京协和医院于去年8月开始在北京东城区三十到三十六岁的妇女中进行了普查，作为全市开展普查的试验田。在接受检查的二千七百一十二人中，子宫癌发病率为0.88％。在北京市党委和卫生局的领导下，北京市的普查工作，随后就扩大到十万人的居民区。防癌普查工作在上海、成都等地也先后开展。
    为了研究我国人民发生癌瘤的原因和寻求防治方法，中国医学科学院对该院四十年来全部肿瘤病例，计二万七千多例进行了统计，对其中子宫颈癌病例进行了研究并提出了新的分级方法。在全国其他各地，也进行了许多有意义的抗癌活动，如上海第一医学院将二十二万病理活体组织检查中的四万七千多个肿瘤病例进行了分析统计，提供了有价值的材料。
    去年秋季全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流大会以来，许多医院采用了中医中药治疗子宫颈癌、食道癌等。如北京肿瘤医院、阜外医院用针灸治疗食道癌，上海用“消瘤丸”治食道癌，一般都有不同程度的好转，吞咽困难的症状消失了，营养状况因此改善了。北京肿瘤医院使用成都、德州、大连等处的处方治疗子宫颈癌也能使一些症状减轻。去年底，国内许多单位都已经展开对临床有效的中药如神农丸、官贯郎散等的研究。已经可以肯定，中医中药对某些恶性肿瘤有一定的疗效。
    去年秋季北京肿瘤医院首先在国内使用钴炮作放射治疗。现在国内使用钴炮的已有上海、广州、天津、武汉、南昌等处。
    肿瘤的实验治疗工作方面，中国医学科学院实验医学研究所和药物研究所使用体内方法检查了一百五十三个中药复方和八十八个单方的抗癌作用，结果发现对动物肿瘤生长的抑制率达到50％以上的药物共有八种，目前正在陆续推广临床使用。
    中国科学院药物研究所对放线菌素K进行了深入的研究，目前正在临床试验中。中国医学科学院抗菌素研究所也找到了对癌细胞起抑制作用的抗菌素，已证实对动物肿瘤有显著疗效。
    中国医学科学院实验医学研究所生物化学系在实验性癌瘤的血清治疗研究中，以小鼠艾氏腹水癌为对象，初步抽提出比较纯的抗元（即在体内能引起抗体产生的异物）。以免疫方法制出的抗癌免疫血清，也初步观察到对癌瘤有疗效，尤其是对早期的疗效更为显著，如接种艾氏腹水癌的小鼠的生命能从平常的十天延长到二十四天。
    中国医学科学院实验医学研究所实验形态学系已做了二百五十多人次的恶性肿瘤的异体移植，现在已有神经纤维肉瘤、纤维肉瘤和食道癌在大白鼠内传到第三代，但还没有获得恒久瘤株。上海中国科学院实验生物研究所也在进行这项工作，他们的纤维肉瘤已传到第三代。
    中国医学科学院实验医学研究所实验形态学系已做了一百二十五个人瘤的组织培养，一例神经纤维肉瘤在试管内已传到第十一代，一例软骨肉瘤和一例纤维肉瘤已传到第四代，但对上皮的恶性肿瘤还没有成功。
    由于党对防治肿瘤的重视，在北京成立了具有现代设备的专收肿瘤病人的医院，在上海成立了肿瘤研究所，在北京、天津、上海、武汉等处也成立了肿瘤研究委员会。目前我国癌瘤防治实验研究工作已迅速开展。
