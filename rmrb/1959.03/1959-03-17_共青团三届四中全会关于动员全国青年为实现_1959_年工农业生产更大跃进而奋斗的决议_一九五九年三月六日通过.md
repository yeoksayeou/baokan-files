    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China's Resolution on Mobilizing Youth Across the Country to Strive for a Greater Leap Forward in Industrial and Agricultural Production in 1959
    Adopted on March 6, 1959
                (I)
      Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of our country have victoriously completed the great tasks of 1958. In that year, our country achieved unprecedented economic success; accumulated rich construction experience; realized the people's commune system in rural areas; and greatly improved the people's communist ideological consciousness. "Going all out, aiming high" has become an important characteristic of the spiritual outlook of the people of our country. This is a great victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, creating favorable conditions for the high-speed development of our country's construction cause in the future, thereby forming a brand-new situation of continuous great leaps forward in our country's socialist construction.
    1959 is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country and a decisive year in the three years of hard work. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held last winter, adopted the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," which has significant historical significance, summarized the main experience of our country's national economic development in 1958, and proposed the guiding principles for national economic development in 1959 and leap forward targets centered on steel, coal, grain, and cotton. Successfully implementing these resolutions will further consolidate and improve the people's commune system, a new social system like the rising sun, further develop social productive forces, and achieve a greater leap forward than in 1958.
    The people of our country have unlimited confidence in achieving this great and arduous task. Currently, the broad masses of workers are universally launching labor competitions centered on technological revolution under the slogan of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward"; the broad masses of farmers are launching large-scale high-yield campaigns centered on increasing grain and cotton production. People can see that a new and larger-scale construction upsurge has been unfolding vigorously on our country's vast land.
    In the victorious year of 1958, the youth of our country played a shock role and vanguard role in the glorious labor of building socialism; the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels carried out much effective work; and the broad masses of youth and Communist Youth League members have also been tempered and strengthened. In order to realize the great and arduous construction tasks of 1959, our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong expect the youth of our country to make greater contributions. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League calls on the Youth League organizations in all regions to widely mobilize and organize the youth of our country so that everyone can continue to maintain revolutionary vigor as the Party expects, and play a greater shock role and vanguard role in the struggle to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959.
                (II)
    The revolutionary vigor of the people is an important spiritual condition for the great leap forward in our country's socialist construction. Without soaring revolutionary vigor, there would be no great victory in 1958; similarly, without greater revolutionary vigor than last year, we will not be able to achieve this year's greater leap forward tasks. In order to fully unleash the infinite potential of our country's 130 million youth and enable them to forever maintain soaring revolutionary vigor, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of youth and continuously improve their communist consciousness. The level of consciousness of our country's youth has been greatly improved through the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, and last year's great leap forward; the influence of bourgeois ideology among the youth has been greatly weakened, and conservative thinking has also been significantly reduced. Like the people of the whole country, the current spiritual state of our country's youth is unprecedentedly invigorated and high-spirited. However, we must see that in our country, the struggle between the two roads has not yet ended, and "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie" is still a long-term task on the political and ideological front. The influence of private ownership thinking on youth cannot be eliminated in a short period of time, and the establishment of a communist worldview cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Therefore, the Youth League organizations in all regions should continue to promote the successful experience of 1958, vigorously strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of youth, strengthen class education, labor education, collectivism education, and communist style education, strengthen education on the dialectical materialist viewpoint, and strengthen education on the methods of youth thinking. We should praise those advanced individuals who "endure hardship first and enjoy benefits later," are selfless and devoted to the collective, and are diligent and thrifty in various practical struggles, and promote the communist labor spirit among the broad masses of youth. We must often help youth correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between the individual and the state, and cultivate the spirit of being aware of the overall situation, considering the whole, emphasizing cooperation, and abiding by discipline. We must constantly encourage youth to study diligently, work hard to research, break down superstitions, liberate their minds, and become strong warriors who are courageous in creation, unafraid of difficulties, and dare to oppose conservatism and establish advanced banners.
    In educating the broad masses of youth, the Youth League organizations should also frequently help them understand the construction situation and tasks of our country and become active propagandists and implementers of the Party's policies. As Comrade Mao Zedong taught us, we must often explain the situation and tasks, the Party's policies, and the methods for completing the tasks clearly to the masses, point out the favorable conditions in the process of advancement and the possible difficulties and ways to overcome them, thereby continuously improving the revolutionary consciousness of our country's youth, so that every young person can understand what the Party and the country require of them; be full of confidence in the future of the revolution and have a high sense of responsibility for the tasks of the revolution; and strive in every possible way to achieve things that should and can be achieved through effort, and be prepared to undertake and overcome difficulties at any time.
    In ideological work, we must be good at conducting specific analysis and not confuse political issues that belong to the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy with ideological issues that belong to the contradiction among the people. On ideological issues among youth, we must adhere to the principle of patient persuasion, pay attention to listening to various different opinions, guide and enlighten them step by step, and convince people with reason. The fundamental method of ideological work is the method of the mass line, which is the method of persuasion and education. We must be good at combining top-down propaganda and education with mobilizing the masses to conduct self-education through great voicing, great blooming, great debates, and big-character posters, so that ideological work can be done more carefully and more deeply.
    The great practice of our people building socialism is the best school for educating and training our country's youth. The plenary session believes that in the great struggle to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959, the communist consciousness and communist style of our country's youth will be further improved.
                (III)
    Under the leadership of the Party, actively organizing youth to participate in labor competitions and giving play to the shock role and vanguard role of youth in socialist construction is a regular and important task of the Communist Youth League organization. In this year's construction movement, we must, on the basis of organizing the broad masses of youth to enthusiastically discuss the current construction situation, construction tasks, and construction targets for 1959, launch a more widespread and in-depth upsurge of competition than in the past to compare advanced elements and compare how to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. We must vigorously mobilize young workers to actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, carry out technological revolutions, and improve labor productivity; mobilize young farmers to conscientiously study and resolutely implement the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, actively participate in the work of rectifying and consolidating people's communes, devote themselves to the large-scale high-yield movement and tool reform movement, and strive to promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    In the national labor competition, the Youth League organizations must earnestly do a good job of regular ideological and organizational work, and mobilize young people to complete various tasks together with adults and the elderly; this is the basic and main aspect. At the same time, under the unified leadership and specific deployment of the Party, the Youth League should actively organize youth to carry out shock activities in a flexible and diverse manner, in accordance with the principles that are conducive to the development of production and adapt to the characteristics of youth, which is also necessary. Many organizational forms and working methods created by various regions in the past, such as organizing youth shock brigades, youth thrift brigades, and launching red flag competitions, have achieved good results and played a positive role in carrying out labor competitions. The Youth League organizations should always attach importance to summarizing experience in this area and strengthen leadership.
    Among the broad masses of youth, we must promote the spirit of mutual learning and common progress, call on youth to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced, make the advanced more advanced, and sincerely encourage and help the backward to emulate the advanced. At any time, in all work, and in all units, we must pay attention to discovering and cultivating advanced individuals and advanced collectives, and hold on-site meetings or activist conferences in a planned and prepared manner to commend and disseminate advanced ideas and advanced experiences. This is a very important working method for Youth League organizations at all levels, and should be better utilized in the future.
    Voluntary labor is a kind of communist labor. Appropriately organizing this kind of labor among youth can not only create material wealth for society, but also enhance the communist qualities of youth and improve their communist consciousness. The Communist Youth League organization should continue to attach importance to this activity.
    In order to ensure that labor competitions can be carried out in a lasting and healthy manner, we must pay attention to the necessary rest of youth in accordance with the principle of "combining work and rest." We must comprehensively care for the lives of young people, and lead them not only to work well and study well, but also to be physically fit. This is a problem that the Youth League organization should always pay attention to.
              (IV)
    Carrying out technological revolutions on a large scale and greatly improving labor productivity are important keys to the successful realization of this year's construction plan. In 1958, the technical level of industrial and agricultural production in our country had been considerably improved compared with the past, but it was still not well adapted to the requirements of the rapid development of our country's construction cause, and it was still very low compared with the technical level of advanced countries in the world. Therefore, in order to more effectively improve our country's labor productivity, complete and overfulfill this year's construction plan, and raise our country's industrial and agricultural technology to the world's advanced level in the next few years, the youth of our country must, together with the people of the whole country, give full play to their creative talents, combine hard work with skillful work, and vigorously promote the vigorous development of the technological revolution movement.
    This year's technological revolution movement has been widely launched, and the youth of the whole country should immediately move faster and be at the forefront of this movement. Young workers should focus on the key to production and actively improve design, equipment, tools, and operating methods; actively carry out versatile activities with one specialty and multiple skills, give full play to the potential of existing equipment, and strive to improve the degree of mechanization and automation. Newly employed young workers should work hard to learn basic operating skills and actively improve their technical proficiency. All young people with conditions should strive to explore and master cutting-edge science and technology as needed. Young farmers should focus on the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, conscientiously learn and master agricultural science and technology knowledge, boldly experiment with and adopt new agricultural technologies; carry out tool reforms on a large scale, strive to master the operating skills of new agricultural tools and modern agricultural machinery, and promote the early realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification.
    The Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should regard mobilizing and leading youth to actively participate in the technological revolution as one of their regular central tasks and earnestly do it well. The plenary session believes that the specific tasks of the Communist Youth League in the technological revolution movement should be: First, to help young people constantly break down superstitions and liberate their minds; and to educate young people to combine bold creation with learning modestly, combine daring to think and daring to do with being realistic, and combine individual research with collective research. Second, to guide young people in a timely manner according to production needs, propose topics, guide young people to conduct research around the key and weak links of production, and propose opinions on technological innovation. Third, to support young people's rationalization proposals and innovative initiatives, commend advanced individuals, and constantly encourage young people's creative enthusiasm. Fourth, to establish various amateur technical learning and technical research organizations, and adopt methods such as holding on-site meetings and holding exhibitions to organize young people to actively learn and promote various advanced technologies and advanced experiences. Fifth, to organize young people to cooperate with veteran workers and veteran farmers, cooperate with technicians, and educate young people to learn from them humbly.
    The technological revolution is a long-term task. The Party regards youth as an important force in carrying out technological revolutions and mastering advanced science and technology, and young people generally have the weaknesses of less experience, lower skills, and insufficient knowledge. Therefore, we must pay special attention to youth's learning, make youth understand that learning is the basis of creation, and must carry out popular science and technology education among youth, attach importance to popular cultural education, and continuously improve the cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge level of our country's youth. At the same time, we must also assist the Party in cultivating a large number of scientific and technological talents who are both red and expert among young people, and continuously strengthen the scientific and technological contingent of our country's working class.
                (V)
    Improving the leadership level of Youth League committees at all levels, continuously improving the working style of the Youth League, and strengthening the grassroots work of the Youth League are important guarantees for better exerting the organizational role of the Youth League. Youth League committees at all levels should continue to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Youth League, resolutely ensure the absolute leadership of the Party over the Youth League in all work; and work with greater initiative and enthusiasm under the close leadership of the Party committees. All Youth League cadres should regularly and conscientiously study and research the Party's instructions and understand the Party's intentions. For the tasks proposed by the Party, we must keep up quickly, keep up closely, and keep up well, take the initiative to offer ideas and think of ways, and report to the Party committee for instructions. When carrying out various tasks, we must promote the spirit of cooperation and be good at cooperating closely with relevant parties.
    All Youth League cadres should conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, study the Party's general line for building socialism and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and continuously improve their political and ideological level. Youth League cadres should also learn to run people's communes, learn the knowledge of leading production and managing the economy, learn some natural science knowledge, and strive to be both red and expert. All Youth League cadres should continue to promote a down-to-earth, thorough, and meticulous working style. Actively respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, participate in production labor, run "experimental plots," establish work base points, and appear among the masses as ordinary laborers. This is an important way for leading cadres to closely link with the masses, link with reality, transform their thinking, and increase their talents.
    Youth League committees at all levels should attach more importance to strengthening the grassroots work of the Youth League and continuously consolidate, improve, and expand the Youth League contingent. Grassroots organizations are the basic combat units of the Youth League organization. With the tremendous development of socialist construction, grassroots cadres are increasingly required to improve their working ability and be good at combining the instructions of the Party committee and the higher-level Youth League committee with the situation of their own unit. Youth League committees in all regions should seize the opportunity to do a good job in rectifying the Youth League, regularly summarize the experience of grassroots work, train grassroots cadres of the Youth League, improve the activity ability of the Youth League branches and groups, and better exert the core role of the Youth League organization among the broad masses of youth and the exemplary role of Youth League members. We should plan to absorb the young activists who have emerged since the Great Leap Forward and meet the standards of Youth League members into the Youth League contingent, so that the Youth League organization can continuously increase new blood.
    The battle drum for a greater leap forward has already sounded. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League calls on the young men and women of our country to muster greater revolutionary vigor and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959; calls on all Communist Youth League members to stand heroically at the forefront of the struggle and become examples for the broad masses of youth; and calls on Youth League cadres across the country to launch larger-scale, in-depth, and meticulous ideological and organizational work among the broad masses of youth, hold high the Party's red flag, closely link with the masses, and do their work more and better than in 1958.

    共青团三届四中全会关于动员全国青年为实现1959年工农业生产更大跃进而奋斗的决议
    一九五九年三月六日通过
                （一）
      我国人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，已经胜利地完成了一九五八年的伟大任务。在这一年里，我们国家获得了空前巨大的经济成就；积累了丰富的建设经验；在农村实现了人民公社化；人们的共产主义思想觉悟大大提高。鼓足干劲，力争上游已经成为我国人民精神面貌的重要特征。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，它为我国今后建设事业的高速度向前发展创造了良好的条件，从而形成了我国社会主义建设不断大跃进的崭新局面。
    一九五九年是我国建国十周年，是苦战三年中具有决定意义的一年。在去年冬季召开的党的八届六中全会通过了具有重大历史意义的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，总结了一九五八年我国国民经济发展的主要经验，并且提出了一九五九年国民经济发展的方针和以钢、煤、粮、棉为中心的跃进指标。胜利地实现这些决议，将使人民公社这一如同初升太阳的新的社会制度，获得进一步的巩固和提高，使社会生产力获得更大的发展，并且实现比一九五八年更大的跃进。
    对于实现这个伟大而艰巨的任务，我国人民具有无限的信心。现在，广大职工，正在“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的口号下，普遍展开以技术革命为中心的劳动竞赛；广大农民，正在以增产粮、棉为中心，展开大面积高额丰产运动。人们可以看到：一个新的更大规模的建设高潮，已经在我国辽阔的土地上，风起云涌地展开了。
    在胜利的一九五八年，我国青年在建设社会主义的光荣劳动中，发挥了突击作用和先锋作用；共青团的各级组织进行了许多有成效的工作；广大青年和共青团员也锻炼得更加坚强了。为了实现一九五九年伟大而艰巨的建设任务，我们的党和毛泽东同志，期望我国青年作出更大的贡献。共青团三届四中全会要求各地团的组织，广泛动员和组织我国青年人人都能够像党所期望的那样，继续鼓足革命干劲，在实现一九五九年更大跃进的斗争中，发挥更大的突击作用和先锋作用。
                （二）
    人民群众的革命干劲是我国社会主义建设大跃进的重要的精神条件。没有冲天的革命干劲，就没有一九五八年的巨大胜利；同样的，没有比去年更大的革命干劲，我们就将不能实现今年的更大跃进的任务。为了充分发挥我国一亿三千万青年的无穷潜力，使他们永远保持冲天的革命干劲，就必须加强青年的政治思想教育工作，不断提高青年的共产主义觉悟。我国青年的觉悟水平，经过整风、反右派斗争和去年的大跃进，已经大大提高了，青年中的资产阶级思想影响大大削弱了，保守思想也显著减少了。同全国人民一样，当前我国青年的精神状态，是空前振奋，斗志昂扬。但是，我们必须看到，在我国，两条道路的斗争还没有结束，“兴无灭资”还是政治思想战线上的一个长期任务，私有制思想对于青年的影响，还不可能在短时期内灭除，共产主义世界观的树立，更不是短期内所可以实现的。因此，各地团的组织应当继续发扬一九五八年的成功经验，大力加强广大青年的政治思想教育，加强阶级教育、劳动教育、集体主义教育和共产主义风格的教育，加强辩证唯物主义观点的教育，加强青年思想方法的教育。应该在各项实际斗争中表扬那些“吃苦在前，得利在后”，大公无私，舍己为群和勤劳节俭的先进人物，在广大青年中发扬共产主义的劳动精神。要经常帮助青年正确地处理个人同集体、个人同国家的关系，养成识大局、顾整体、讲协作、守纪律的精神。要经常鼓舞青年刻苦学习，努力钻研，破除迷信，解放思想，成为勇于创造，不畏艰险，敢于反对保守，树立先进旗帜的坚强战士。
    在向广大青年进行教育中，团的组织还应当经常帮助青年了解我们国家的建设形势和任务，成为党的政策的积极的宣传者和执行者。要像毛泽东同志教导我们的那样，经常把形势任务、党的政策和完成任务的方法，向群众交代得清清楚楚，指出在前进中的有利条件和可能碰到的困难以及克服困难的办法，从而不断提高我国青年的革命自觉，使每个青年都能够懂得党和国家要求于自己的是什么；对革命的前途充满信心，对革命的任务具有高度责任感；凡是经过努力应该和可能做到的事情，都一定千方百计地努力争取做到，并且随时准备承担困难和战胜困难。
    在思想工作中，要善于进行具体分析，不要把属于敌我矛盾的政治问题同属于人民内部矛盾的思想问题混淆起来。对青年中的思想问题，要坚持耐心说服的原则，注意听取各种不同的意见，循循善诱，以理服人。思想工作的根本方法是群众路线的方法，是说服教育的方法。要善于把自上而下的宣传教育同发动群众用大鸣、大放、大争、大辩、大字报进行自我教育结合起来，把思想工作做得更细致，更深入。
    我国人民建设社会主义的伟大实践，是教育和锻炼我国青年的最好的学校。全会相信，在争取一九五九年更大跃进的伟大斗争中，我国青年的共产主义觉悟和共产主义风格，必将得到更大的提高。
                （三）
    在党的领导下，积极组织青年参加劳动竞赛，发挥青年在社会主义建设中的突击作用和先锋作用，是共青团组织一项经常的重要工作。在今年的建设运动中，我们必须在组织广大青年热烈讨论当前的建设形势、建设任务和一九五九年建设指标的基础上，掀起一个比过去更广泛、更深入的比先进、比多快好省的竞赛热潮。大力发动青年职工，积极投入增产节约运动，进行技术革命，提高劳动生产率；发动青年农民，认真学习和坚决贯彻执行党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，积极参加整顿和巩固人民公社工作，投入大面积的高额丰产运动和工具改革运动，努力促进农、林、牧、副、渔业的全面发展。
    在全民的劳动竞赛中，团的组织要切实做好经常的思想工作和组织工作，发动青年同成年人、老年人一起完成各项任务；这是基本的、主要的方面。同时，青年团在党的统一领导和具体部署之下，按照有利于发展生产的原则，适应青年特点，采取灵活的多种多样的形式，积极组织青年进行突击活动，也是必要的。过去各地所创造的许多组织形式和工作方法，如组织青年突击队、青年节约队、开展红旗竞赛等，都收到了良好的效果，对开展劳动竞赛起了积极的作用，团的组织应当经常重视总结这方面的经验，加强领导。
    在广大青年中，要发扬互相学习、共同进步的精神，号召青年学先进、赶先进，先进的要更先进，并热诚地鼓励和帮助落后的向先进的看齐。在各个时期、各项工作、各个单位中，要随时注意发现和培养先进人物和先进集体，并且有计划有准备地召开现场会议或积极分子大会，表彰和传播先进思想和先进经验。这是各级团的组织一个很重要的工作方法，今后应该更好地加以运用。
    义务劳动是一种共产主义的劳动。适当地在青年中间组织这种劳动，不仅能够为社会创造物质财富，还能够增强青年的共产主义品质，提高他们的共产主义觉悟。共青团组织应当继续重视这种活动。
    为了使劳动竞赛能够持久的健康的进行，要按照“劳逸结合”的原则，注意青年必要的休息。全面地关心青年生活，带领他们不仅作到工作好，学习好，还要作到身体好。这是团组织应当经常注意的问题。
              （四）
    大搞技术革命，大大提高劳动生产率，是胜利实现今年建设计划的重要关键。一九五八年，我国工业和农业生产的技术水平，已经较过去有了相当的提高，但是跟我国建设事业迅速发展的要求还很不适应，同世界先进国家的技术水平相比，也还是很低的。因此，为了更有效地提高我国的劳动生产率，完成和超额完成今年的建设计划，为了在今后若干年内把我国的工业和农业技术提高到世界先进水平，我国青年，必须同全国人民一起，充分发挥自己的创造才能，把苦干和巧干结合起来，大力促进技术革命运动的蓬勃发展。
    今年的技术革命运动已经广泛展开了，全国青年应当立即快马加鞭，走在这个运动的前列。青年职工应当围绕生产关键，积极地改进设计、设备、工具和操作方法；积极地开展一专多能的多面手活动，充分发挥现有设备潜力，努力提高机械化、自动化的程度。新入厂的青年工人，应当努力学习基本操作技术，积极提高技术熟练程度。一切有条件的青年，应该根据需要，努力探索和掌握尖端科学技术。青年农民应当围绕农业“八字宪法”，认真学习和掌握农业科学技术知识，大胆试验和采用新的农业技术；大搞工具改革，努力掌握新农具和现代农业机械的操作本领，促进农业机械化、电气化的早日实现。
    共青团的各级组织，应当把动员与带领青年积极参加技术革命作为自己经常的中心任务之一，认真地把它做好。全会认为，共青团在技术革命运动中的具体任务应当是：一、帮助青年不断地破除迷信，解放思想；并且教育青年把大胆创造同虚心学习结合起来，把敢想敢干同实事求是结合起来，把个人钻研同集体研究结合起来。二、根据生产需要及时地向青年指引方向，提出课题，引导青年围绕生产关键和薄弱环节进行研究，并提出革新技术的意见。三、支持青年的合理化建议和革新创举，表扬先进人物，不断地鼓舞青年的创造热情。四、建立各种业余的技术学习和技术研究组织，并且采用召开现场会议、举办展览会等方法，组织青年积极学习和推广各种先进技术和先进经验。五、组织青年同老工人、老农民合作，同技术人员合作，并且教育青年虚心地向他们学习。
    技术革命是个长期的任务，党把青年看作是进行技术革命和掌握先进科学技术的重要力量，而青年一般具有经验少、技术低和知识不足的弱点，因此，我们必须特别注意青年的学习，使青年懂得学习是创造的基础，必须在青年中进行科学和技术知识的普及教育，重视普及文化教育，不断地提高我国青年的文化、科学和技术知识水平。同时，还必须协助党在青年中培养出大批的又红又专的科学技术人材，不断加强我国工人阶级的科学技术队伍。
                （五）
    提高各级团委的领导水平，不断改善团的工作作风，加强团的基层工作，是更好地发挥团的组织作用的重要保证。各级团委应该继续贯彻团的三届三中全会决议的精神，在各项工作中，坚决保证党对团的绝对领导；在党委的密切领导下，以更大的积极性和主动性进行工作。全团干部应当经常地认真地学习和钻研党的指示，领会党的意图。对党所提出的任务，要跟得快、跟得紧、跟得好，主动地出主意、想办法，向党委汇报请示。在进行各项工作时，要发扬协作精神，善于同有关方面密切配合。
    全团干部应该认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，学习党的建设社会主义的总路线和党的八届六中全会决议，不断地提高政治思想水平。团的干部还应该学会办公社，学会领导生产和管理经济的知识，学点自然科学知识，努力做到又红又专。全团干部应该继续发扬扎扎实实、深入细致的工作作风。积极响应党中央的号召，参加生产劳动，办“试验田”，建立工作基点，以普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现。这是使领导干部密切联系群众、联系实际，改造思想，增长才能的重要途径。
    各级团委要更加重视加强团的基层工作，不断地巩固提高和壮大团的队伍。基层组织是团组织的基本战斗单位。随着社会主义建设事业的巨大发展，越来越要求基层干部提高工作能力，善于把党委和上级团委的指示与本单位的情况结合起来。各地团委，都要抓紧做好整团工作，经常总结基层工作的经验，训练团的基层干部，提高团的支部和小组的活动能力，更好地发挥团的组织在广大青年中的核心作用和团员的模范作用。应该有计划地把大跃进以来涌现出的合乎团员标准的青年积极分子吸收到团的队伍中来，使团的组织不断增加新的血液。
    更大跃进的战鼓已经敲响了。共青团三届四中全会号召我国男女青年，鼓起更大的革命干劲，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗；号召全体共青团员，英勇地站在斗争的最前列，成为广大青年的榜样；号召全国团的干部，在广大青年中展开更大规模的深入细致的思想工作和组织工作，高举党的红旗，密切联系群众，把自己的工作做得比一九五八年更多更好。
