Using Labor Requires Careful Accounting
    Zeng Zhi
    Although our agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, with total grain and cotton output doubling, agricultural labor productivity still needs to be further improved. Increasing labor productivity is a major task in our country's agricultural production.

    To increase labor productivity, we need to start by calculating the accounts. After calculating how many kilograms of grain were produced by one laborer and one work-day last year, and how many kilograms of grain each laborer and each work-day should produce this year, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed that the entire province of Guangdong should strive to double labor productivity this year. This is the most fundamental guarantee for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    There are many measures to improve labor productivity, such as: carrying out tool reforms, increasing the degree of mechanization and electrification, improving labor organization, rationally arranging and using labor, improving farming techniques, increasing the skill of using tools, strengthening political work, strengthening labor discipline, and improving labor enthusiasm and creativity. , etc., can all achieve the purpose of improving labor productivity. We must make efforts in many ways to enable each laborer and each work-day to play its role to the maximum extent.

    When formulating production plans, communes and production teams should not only calculate how much seed, fertilizer, etc. is needed to produce a certain amount of things, but also calculate how many work-days need to be invested; it is also necessary to calculate how many work-days are required to complete a certain quantity and quality of agricultural work. There may be several methods that can achieve the goal, and this requires choosing one that spends the least labor and can do things better. When calculating, the entire work process should be considered as a whole, and only a segment of the work should not be considered. For example: although crude fertilizers and refined fertilizers with the same fertilizer efficiency increase grain production equally, it seems at first glance that refined fertilizers require more labor, but they can save more labor in fertilizer transportation. Another example is in the prevention of natural disasters, it may seem for a while that the labor spent is useless for increasing production; however, if no prevention is taken, it will take more labor to rescue after the disaster occurs; after the disaster, it will also make a lot of labor spent on cultivating crops be in vain. All increase production measures must be considered as a whole and carefully calculated. After such calculation, it is possible to make rational use of labor, save labor, and increase labor productivity.

    The central purpose of careful calculation in the use of labor is to facilitate the development of production. Generally speaking, the higher the unit yield, the less labor is spent per unit product. However, in actual production, this situation may also occur: originally, it only took ten man-days to produce three hundred kilograms of grain, but to increase production by another three hundred kilograms of grain, it takes fifteen man-days, which costs five more man-days than producing the original three hundred kilograms. In this case, should we invest so much labor needed to increase production, or not invest it? The answer is affirmative, as long as there is so much labor, it should be invested. Because under the current conditions in our country, increased production mainly relies on manual labor rather than machines. It is of course very good to be able to increase the production of more grain with less manpower; if not, it is worth spending a little more labor. We can only save labor as much as possible on the premise of ensuring increased production, and we cannot fail to use labor that should be used in order to save it.

    Careful calculation in the use of labor is mainly to avoid waste, use labor more rationally, and strive to produce more things while reducing labor expenditure.

    使用劳力要核算
    曾志
    我们的农业生产，去年虽然获得了史无前例的大丰收，粮棉总产量都翻了一番；但是，农业的劳动生产率仍然需要进一步提高。提高劳动生产率，是我国农业生产上的一个重大任务。
    要提高劳动生产率，需要先算算账。中共广东省委在计算了去年一个劳动力、一个劳动日生产多少斤粮食，今年每个劳动力、每个劳动日应当生产多少粮食以后，提出今年广东全省要努力争取劳动生产率翻一番。这是实现今年农业生产的更大更好更全面的跃进的最根本的保证。
    提高劳动生产率的措施很多，诸如：进行工具改革，提高机械化、电气化的程度，改善劳动组织，合理安排和使用劳动力，改良耕作技术，提高使用工具的熟练程度，加强政治工作，加强劳动纪律，提高劳动积极性和创造性，等等，都可以达到提高劳动生产率的目的。必须从多方面努力，使每个劳动力和每个劳动日能够最大限度地发挥作用。
    公社和生产队制定生产计划，不但要计算生产多少东西需要多少种子、肥料等等，而且要计算需要投入多少劳动日；还要计算完成一定数量和质量的某种农活，需要多少劳动日。可能有几种做法都能达到目的，这就要选择一种花费劳动最少，而又能把事情办得更好的做法。计算时应该通盘考虑整个工作过程，不能只看到一个片断的工作。例如：用粗制的肥料和肥效相同的精制肥料虽然增产的粮食相等，乍看起来好像精制肥料需要多用劳动力，但是在运肥上却能节省更多劳动力。又如，在预防自然灾害方面，一时看起来会觉得所花费的劳动对增产是无益的；但是，如果不预防，等灾害发生了再挽救，就要花费更多的劳动力；受了灾害，还会使在培育作物方面所花费的许多劳动成为白费力气。对各项增产措施，都要通盘考虑，仔细核算。经过这样核算，就可以做到合理使用劳动力，节约劳动力，提高劳动生产率。
    在劳动力使用上实行精打细算，中心目的是有利于发展生产。一般地说，单位产量越高，单位产品所花费的劳动也越少。但是，在实际生产中也可能出现这种情况：本来生产三百斤粮食，只需要十个人工，再增产三百斤粮食，却需要十五个人工，比生产原来的三百斤要多花费五个人工。在这种情况下，是投入增产所需要的这样多人工呢、还是不投入？答复是肯定的，只要有这样多的人工，就应当投入。因为在我国目前的条件下，增产主要还是靠人工而不是机器，能够以较少的人力增产更多的粮食，当然很好；不能，则稍为多花一些劳动力也是值得的。只能在保证增产的前提下尽可能地节约劳力，而不能为了节约，把应当使用的劳动力也不使用。
    劳动力使用上的精打细算，主要是为了避免浪费，把劳动力使用得更合理，在力求增产更多东西的条件下，做到少花费劳动力。
