    People say the East China Sea has big winds and waves,
    Even when there is no wind, the waves still roll.
    Guarding the coast for three full years,
    Even the monstrous waves listen to us,
    Sailing across the strait through wind and rain,
    Like riding a warhorse on flat ground.
    Everyone says the Northwest has a lot of wind and sand,
    So what if there is wind and sand?
    One shot pierces the Qilian Mountains,
    Two hands part ten thousand miles of sand,
    Uncover the treasure bowl of the Northwest,
    Dedicate ten thousand tons of oil to the country.

    壮志雄心
  解放军某部复员去玉门油矿战士集体创作
    人说东海风浪大，
    海面无风滚浪花，
    守卫海防整三年，
    惊涛骇浪也听话，
    穿雨乘风飘海峡，
    如像平地跑战马。
    都说西北多风沙，
    多风多沙算得啥，
    一枪戳穿祁连山，
    双手拨开万里沙，
    揭开西北聚宝盆，
    万吨石油献国家。
