Ways to Improve Agricultural Labor Productivity in China
Jie Yin

Fundamentally Change the Situation of Five Hundred Million Peasants Just Scrounging for Food

In 1958, China's grain output increased from 370 billion jin in 1957 to 750 billion jin; the yield per unit area increased from 204 jin in 1957 to 420 jin. Both the total output and the yield per unit area doubled. The increase in one year was five times more than the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan. This is an unprecedented miracle and a true Great Leap Forward. However, due to the low level of development of agricultural productivity in our country, agricultural labor productivity is still very low. Each labor work-day produces an average of only about 28 jin of grain, the yield per mu is only about 450 jin, and each laborer produces only about 8,000 jin of grain annually. This is only one-sixth of the average output per labor work-day of Soviet collective farms, and only one-thirtieth of that of Soviet state farms. Therefore, we have not yet broken free from the situation where 500 million peasants are just scrounging for food. This is a major indication of our country's low production level and the lack of affluence in people's lives.

For thousands of years, China has been an agricultural country with a large population and less than three mu of cultivated land per capita, and the social labor value rate is very low. However, for a long time, the problem of low agricultural labor productivity has not attracted more attention. After liberation, until the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, this problem was not prominent enough. After the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, production targets increased daily, new measures to increase production emerged daily, the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture was established, and mass movements for large-scale water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and deep plowing were launched throughout the country. After the people's communes were established, industry, agriculture, military affairs, education, and commerce advanced simultaneously, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries developed in an all-round way. In addition, there was large-scale steel and iron smelting by the whole people, and large-scale county and commune industries were established, resulting in production tasks increasing several or even dozens of times. Due to low agricultural labor productivity, a shortage of agricultural labor emerged. Therefore, rapidly increasing agricultural labor productivity has become a key issue in ensuring the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, realizing the comprehensive revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and implementing the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture. We can imagine that if, starting from now, we gradually raise China's agricultural labor productivity to the level of a current Anshan Iron and Steel worker's labor productivity, that is, each agricultural laborer produces 300,000 jin of grain annually, then we would only need 10 million laborers engaged in agricultural production to produce 3 trillion jin of grain annually, guaranteeing an average of 5,000 jin of grain per person. If we further increase the grain yield per mu to 5,000 jin, then we could require only one mu of land per person to produce grain, and the country would only need 600 million mu of land to produce grain. Each laborer would only cultivate 60 mu of land, which would guarantee the needs. When we realize this ideal, we can also realize the requirement of the "three-three system" for farmland, fundamentally changing the situation of 500 million people in China just scrounging for food. In this way, we can not only gradually draw out the vast majority of agricultural labor to support national industrial construction and engage in diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, but also gradually eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and manual labor, laying a solid material and technical foundation for the transition to an ideal communist society.

There are many ways to increase agricultural labor productivity, but in general, they are nothing more than two aspects: one is to increase people's labor enthusiasm. This requires rationally adjusting the relations of production between people, improving labor organization, improving management, and promoting the spirit of exerting full effort and striving for the upstream. The facts of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 prove that this is a basic and important aspect.

However, there is a certain limit to increasing labor productivity from these aspects alone; and as the unit output continues to increase, more labor must be invested accordingly. Therefore, the other aspect of increasing agricultural labor productivity must start with improving tools. Only by gradually realizing the mechanization and electrification of agricultural production and achieving a high degree of automation in the production process can we fundamentally improve labor productivity.

The development of social production starts with the development of productive forces, and the development of productive forces starts with the development of production tools. The development of production tools is the main sign of the development of productive forces. The entire historical development process of society is the process of continuous improvement and enhancement of production tools; and people's creative labor is mainly reflected in the creation of production tools. When people began to create simple manual tools and were able to engage in hunting and fishing, they were liberated from the realm of ordinary animals and began the social life of primitive communism. When production tools further developed and improved, from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and then to the Iron Age, as well as the emergence of power machinery industry, human society gradually transitioned from primitive communism to slave society, feudal society, and even capitalist society. If the steam age is the age of capitalism, the electric age is the age of socialism.

The Level of Agricultural Labor Productivity is Directly Proportional to the Degree of Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification

The level of agricultural labor productivity is directly proportional to the degree of agricultural mechanization. The greater the degree of agricultural mechanization, the higher the agricultural labor productivity. The reason why the Soviet Union's agricultural labor productivity is much higher than China's is that their degree of agricultural mechanization is much greater than China's. The Soviet Union basically realized agricultural mechanization as early as 1937. By 1956, the Soviet Union had 1.5 million tractors, with an average of 2,140 mu of cultivated land per tractor. At present, China only has 26,900 agricultural tractors, with an average of one tractor for every 61,338 mu. The same is true from the domestic situation in China. State farms have a much higher degree of mechanization than people's communes, so the grain produced per labor work-day on state farms is much more than that of people's communes. According to the survey and statistical materials of 1958, the grain produced per labor day on state farms was 87 jin, while that of people's communes was only 28 jin. The agricultural labor productivity of state farms was more than twice that of people's communes. It is even more obvious from the harvest volume of specific crops. State farms have a high degree of mechanization in wheat cultivation, so the wheat produced per labor work-day is nine times higher than that of people's communes; in the field of rice, the degree of mechanization is low, and the output per labor work-day is only three times higher than that of people's communes.

Gradually realizing the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and achieving a high degree of automation in the production process, is the inevitable path to technically transform China's agriculture. Due to the comprehensive development of China's entire national economy, the rapid increase in the level of industrialization, especially the continuous leap forward in national steel production, it can be imagined that the implementation of large-scale agricultural mechanization and electrification is not far off. And once this work begins, it will develop rapidly. However, the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification cannot be completed in a short time. Before the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, especially this year, when there is no large supply of agricultural machinery, can we greatly increase agricultural labor productivity? The answer is also affirmative.

Increasing Yield Per Unit Area is an Important Way to Increase Agricultural Labor Productivity

First of all, the facts of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 tell us that the higher the unit yield, the relatively less labor is required, which has become a universal objective law. This can be clearly seen from the comparison of unit area yield, labor input, and output per worker for rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in 1957 and 1958. The yield of rice was 358 jin per mu in 1957, with 15 workers per mu, and an output of 24 jin per worker; in 1958, the yield was 643 jin per mu, with only 22.5 workers, and an output of 28.5 jin per worker. That is to say, the output increased by 79.6%, while the labor per mu increased by only 50%, and the output per worker increased by 18.8%. The yield of wheat was 114 jin per mu in 1957, with 7 workers per mu, and an output of 16 jin per worker; in 1958, the yield was 188 jin per mu, with 10.5 workers, and an output of 18 jin per worker. That is to say, the output increased by 65%, the labor increased by only 50%, and the output per worker increased by 12.5%. The yield of miscellaneous grains was 138 jin per mu in 1957, with 8.5 workers per mu, and an output of 16.2 jin per worker; in 1958, the yield was 277 jin per mu, with 12.5 workers, and an output of 22.1 jin per worker. That is, the yield per mu doubled, the labor increased by 47%, and the output per worker increased by 36.4%. This can also be proved from the different labor input and output per worker for different yields of various crops in 1958. According to a survey of rice production labor input in seven survey points in six provinces: ordinary land with a yield of 1,194 jin per mu required 35 workers per mu, with an output of 34 jin per worker; while high-yield land with a yield of 2,913 jin per mu required 56 workers per mu, with an output of 52 jin per worker; that is, the yield per mu increased by 144%, the labor increased by only 60%, and the output per worker increased by 53%. A survey of corn production in 21 communes (teams) in 19 counties in Shanxi Province showed that ordinary land yielded 623 jin per mu, requiring 15.6 workers per mu, with an output of 40 jin per worker; high-yield land yielded 2,558 jin per mu, requiring 26.9 workers per mu, with an output of 95 jin per worker; high-yield land with high yields yielded 7,511 jin per mu, requiring 30.6 workers per mu, with an output of 245 jin per worker. Compared with ordinary land and high-yield land, the yield per mu increased by 310%, the labor increased by only 72%, and the output per worker increased by 137%. Compared with ordinary land and high-yield land with high yields, the yield per mu increased by 1105%, the labor increased by only 96%, and the output per worker increased by 510%. A survey of cotton production labor input in the Hongqi People's Commune in Weinan, Shaanxi showed that ordinary land yielded 140 jin of lint cotton per mu, requiring 18.05 workers per mu, with an output of 7.8 jin per worker; high-yield land with high yields yielded 1,536.37 jin per mu, requiring 111.63 workers per mu, with an output of 13.8 jin per worker, that is, the yield per mu increased by 997%, the labor increased by only 520%, and the output per worker increased by 77%. There are many other materials from all over the country that can prove that the higher the unit yield, the higher the output per worker, and the relatively less labor is required. This is because, regardless of high or low yields, the unit labor input will not increase significantly in certain operations, or it is basically fixed. When the yield increases, although the labor will still increase, it will be relatively reduced. Therefore, intensive cultivation and increasing the yield per unit area is an important way to increase agricultural labor productivity.

To Increase Agricultural Labor Productivity, We Must See Both People and Things

Secondly, whether it is the development of productive forces or the development of production relations, people are the decisive factor. The experience of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 also proves that promoting people's enthusiasm, creativity, hard work, and skillful work is the most effective measure to increase labor productivity. Because, whether it is improving labor organization, improving management, reforming farming systems, or improving various tools, it is inseparable from people's efforts. In 1958, due to the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the rural areas were short of more than 100 billion work-days (calculated according to the attendance rate and labor quota in 1957). Due to the significant increase in the attendance rate of male and female full and semi-laborers, coupled with improved management and improved labor organization, the labor efficiency was further improved, which solved about 50% of the labor shortage. The mass movement to carry out tool reform invented and created tens of thousands of farm tools, manufactured and promoted more than 350 million pieces, which also solved about 50% of the labor shortage. These two aspects are the decisive factors to ensure the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958. However, according to last year's experience, there are also two issues worth noting in this regard. One is seeing people but not things. Some people, when mentioning promoting people's enthusiasm, simply emphasize exerting full effort, striving for the upstream, and excessively prolonging working hours and increasing labor intensity. This approach cannot last long, and if it lasts for a long time, it will affect the health of the laborers and reduce labor productivity. The other is seeing things but not people. Some people, when mentioning the need to increase labor productivity, demand that the state supply various agricultural machinery. These people know that it is impossible to meet their requirements immediately, but they just wait passively instead of actively mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm and creativity to carry out tool reform. In this way, it is also impossible to increase agricultural labor productivity. Objective facts prove that to increase agricultural labor productivity, we must see both people and things. That is, we must work hard and skillfully; we must promote people's enthusiasm and creativity; we must improve labor organization, improve management, and rationally adjust the relations of production between people to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm; we must creatively reform the farming system, improve various production tools, and implement agricultural technology revolution. Only when human factors and material factors are simultaneously explored, and productive forces and production relations adapt to each other and continue to develop forward, can we greatly increase agricultural labor productivity.

In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the Chinese people exerted full effort, strove for the upstream, and promoted the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to create. They broke superstitions, launched a mass movement for comprehensive tool reform by the whole people, invented and created tens of thousands of tools, and also initially explored and utilized various power energy sources such as water, wind, marsh gas, tide, machinery, and electricity. This not only greatly improved labor efficiency, reduced the heavy labor of peasants, and eased the tense situation of agricultural labor shortage, but also guaranteed the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. It also created various high-efficiency tools that meet the requirements of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture for China's agricultural production. In particular, the emergence of rope-traction machines and electric plows provided a treasure trove of selection for realizing China's agricultural mechanization and electrification, and found a shortcut for realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. In addition, it also cultivated a professional team engaged in agricultural machinery research and production, manufacturing, promotion and use, developed county and commune agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair industries, and accumulated leadership experience, laying a preliminary ideological, technical, and material foundation for realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. Facts prove that tool reform is not only a fundamental measure to increase labor productivity at present, but also a fundamental way to gradually and quickly achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification with good results and low cost.

At present, we must engage in large-scale tool reform, large-scale power energy, and large-scale semi-mechanization of agriculture.

In order to further increase agricultural labor productivity, ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, and actively prepare for the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, where should we start in terms of tool reform? First of all, we must look at the labor input of several major crops. Rice: According to a survey of medium-yield rice labor input in the Wanjin Commune in Xiaogan, Hubei, the total tillage labor input was 69.1, including 7 workers for plowing, harrowing, and hoeing, 12.9 workers for sowing, 5 workers for irrigation, 20 workers for transporting and applying fertilizer, 12.6 workers for harvesting, and 11.6 workers for other tasks. Among them, the labor input for transporting and applying fertilizer was the largest, accounting for 28.8% of the total labor input, the labor input for raising seedlings and sowing accounted for 18.6%, and the labor input for harvesting accounted for 18.2%, and the sum of the three accounted for 65.6% of the total labor input. Wheat: According to a survey of medium-yield wheat labor input in the Juxing No. 3 Commune in Hongzhao, Shanxi, the total tillage labor input was 38.5, including 3.7 workers for plowing, harrowing, and hoeing, 1.8 workers for sowing, 0.8 workers for drainage and irrigation, 22 workers for transporting and applying fertilizer, 9.3 workers for harvesting, and 0.9 workers for other tasks. Among them, the labor input for transporting and applying fertilizer was the largest, accounting for 57.1% of the total labor input, and harvesting accounted for 24.1%, and the sum of the two accounted for 81.2% of the total labor input. Corn: According to a survey of medium-yield corn labor input in the Taiqian Management Area of the Shouzhang People's Commune in Shandong, the total tillage labor input was 137.8, including 35.1 workers for plowing, harrowing, and hoeing, 5.2 workers for sowing, 19.5 workers for drainage and irrigation, 58.5 workers for transporting and applying fertilizer, 7.8 workers for harvesting, and 11.7 workers for other tasks. Among them, the labor input for transporting and applying fertilizer was the largest, accounting for 42.5% of the total labor input, plowing, harrowing, and hoeing accounted for 25.4%, and drainage and irrigation accounted for 14.1%, and the sum of the three accounted for 82% of the total labor input. Cotton: According to a survey of medium-yield cotton labor input in the Wusi Commune in Datun Township, Chaoyang, Liaoning, the total tillage labor input was 67.8, including 7.3 workers for plowing, harrowing, and hoeing, 2.9 workers for sowing, 3 workers for irrigation, 22.7 workers for transporting and applying fertilizer, 18 workers for harvesting, and 13.9 workers for other tasks. Among them, the labor input for transporting and applying fertilizer was the largest, accounting for 33.5% of the total labor input, harvesting accounted for 26.6%, and other field management accounted for 20.5%, and the sum of the three accounted for 80.6% of the total labor input. From the labor input of these four crops, it is not difficult to see that transporting and applying fertilizer accounts for the largest amount of labor, followed by harvesting. In addition, rice transplanting, cotton field management, and deep plowing of general land also occupy a large amount of labor, and the labor is also very heavy. As long as the tool reform work can be done well in these areas, a large number of labor can be saved, the labor intensity of peasants can be reduced, and labor productivity can be increased.

Secondly, let's look at the seasonal labor input. Generally, spring plowing and spring planting, summer harvesting and summer planting, and the three autumn seasons are the most labor-intensive, because the time is short, the task is tight, and agricultural activities are concentrated. If calculated according to the general labor quota, the labor shortage in these seasons is generally about 30%-50%. Accordingly, tool reform must also start with the most seasonal agricultural activities. The experience in 1958 proves that the ball-bearing, rubber-wheeled, and cable-way transportation tools can increase work efficiency by several to more than ten times; the harvesting and threshing tools can be replaced with fast rice harvesters and harvesters and threshers, which can also increase work efficiency by one to several times; rice transplanters can also increase work efficiency by several to more than ten times compared with manual transplanting; processing tool reform can also increase work efficiency by several times or more. Analyze the situation, grasp the key points, carry out large-scale tool reform in a planned and led manner, and promote universal use, which can not only solve the problem of seasonal labor shortage, but also increase work efficiency by several or even ten times. In this way, it is entirely possible to increase labor productivity by one or even several times on the existing basis.

Based on the above analysis, it is not difficult to see that in order to increase agricultural labor productivity by about one time in 1959, in addition to fully exerting the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the most realistic and reliable way is to break superstitions, invent and create, engage in large-scale tool reform, engage in large-scale power energy, and engage in large-scale semi-mechanization of agriculture. Relying on tool reform and semi-mechanization to eat in 1959 is not a passive attitude towards mechanization and electrification, which is determined by China's specific conditions. Because the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification in China must proceed from China's actual situation, not only to meet the needs of different natural conditions and different crops in various parts of China, but also to meet the requirements of the leap forward goals of agricultural production and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture for increasing agricultural production. This requires not only a high degree of mechanization and electrification to achieve a high degree of automation in the production process, but also a high degree of intensive cultivation to implement the agricultural policy of high yield, less planting, and more harvesting, and gradually realize the requirement of the "three-three system" for agriculture. Therefore, we must start with large-scale tool reform, critically accept the experience of other countries according to the actual needs of production, and combine manufacturing, improvement, and creation on the basis of existing tools, invent, identify, promote, improve, popularize, and improve simultaneously, and gradually turn wooden ones into iron ones, small ones into large ones, simple ones into complex ones, low-level ones into high-level ones, indigenous ones into foreign ones, and human and animal power into mechanical and electrical power. Through tool reform, first realize agricultural semi-mechanization, and gradually realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, which is an inevitable way to technically transform China's agriculture quickly, well, and economically. Mechanization and electrification are the direction and goal of tool reform, and tool reform is the prerequisite and foundation for realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. Grasping tool reform in 1959 is precisely to actively prepare for agricultural mechanization and electrification. We call tool reform the budding of technological revolution. Comrade Shaoqi said: "Once this wheel is started, it will never stop for one year, and it will never stop for ten thousand years." This is the reason. In order to further develop agricultural productive forces, increase agricultural labor productivity to a new level, and actively prepare for the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, we must carry out a broader, more detailed, and more effective tool reform movement in 1959. This is a fundamental way to increase agricultural labor productivity at present.

    提高我国农业劳动生产率的途径
    解荫?
    提高农业劳动生产率，根本改变五亿农民弄饭吃的局面
    1958年我国粮食产量，由1957年的三千七百亿斤增加到七千五百亿斤；单位面积产量，由1957年的二百零四斤提高到四百二十斤，无论总产量或单位面积产量都翻了一番。一年的增产数量，比第一个五年计划增产的总和还多五倍。这是一个史无前例的奇迹，确是一个大跃进。但是，由于我国农业生产力的发展水平还很低，农业劳动生产率还是很低的。每一个劳动工日，平均生产粮食不过二十八斤左右，亩产不过四百五十斤，每个劳动力全年生产的粮食不过八千多斤，只及苏联集体农庄每一劳动工日的平均产量的六分之一，只及苏联国营农场的三十分之一，因此还不能摆脱五亿农民弄饭吃的局面。这是我国生产水平低，人民生活不富裕的一个主要标志。
    我国几千年来就是个农业国，人口多，每人平均占有耕地不到三亩，社会劳动价值率很低。但是，长久以来，农业劳动生产率低这个问题，还未引起人们更多的注意。解放以后，直到1958年农业生产大跃进以前，这个问题也还不够突出。1958年农业生产大跃进以后，生产指标日日增，增产措施日日新，确定了农业八字宪法，各地普遍开展了大搞水利、积肥和深翻地的群众运动；在人民公社化后，又工、农、兵、学、商齐头并进，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展；再加上大搞全民炼钢炼铁，大办县社工业，生产任务几倍几十倍的增加。由于农业劳动生产率低，才出现了农业劳动力不足的紧张情况。因此，迅速地提高农业劳动生产率，就成为当前保证农业生产不断跃进，实现农、林、牧、副、渔全线大革命，贯彻工农业并举的方针的关键问题。我们可以设想，如果从现在开始，逐步地把我国农业劳动生产率提高到一个鞍钢工人现在的劳动生产率的水平，即每个农业劳动力全年生产粮食三十万斤，那么，我们从事农业生产的劳动力只需要有一千万个，就可以年产粮食三万亿斤，保证每人平均有粮五千斤。如果再把每亩粮食产量提高到五千斤，那时，我们就可以一个人只要一亩地生产粮食，全国只需六亿亩地生产粮食，每个劳力只耕种六十亩地，就可以保证需要了。我们实现了这个理想，也就可以实现农田三三制的要求，从根本上改变我国五亿人口弄饭吃的局面。这样，我们不仅可以逐渐抽出绝大部分的农业劳动力去支援国家工业建设，和从事林、牧、副、渔等多种经营，而且也就可以开始逐步地消灭工农差别、城乡差别和脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，为过渡到理想的共产主义社会奠定巩固的物质技术基础。
    提高农业劳动生产率的办法是多方面的，但总的来说，不外两个方面：一是提高人的劳动积极性。这就要从合理调整人与人的生产关系，改进劳动组织，改善经营管理，发扬鼓足干劲力争上游的精神。1958年农业生产大跃进的事实证明这是一个基本的和重要的方面。
    但是，仅仅从这些方面提高劳动生产率毕竟是有一定限度的；而且随着单位产量的不断提高，还必须相应地投入更多的劳动力。因此，提高农业劳动生产率的另一方面还必须从改进工具着手，只有逐步地实现农业生产的机械化、电气化，达到生产过程的高度自动化，才是提高劳动生产率的根本办法。
    社会生产的发展，是从生产力发展开始的，而生产力的发展，又首先从生产工具的发展开始。生产工具的发展，是生产力发展的主要标志。整个社会的历史发展过程，也即是生产工具不断改进提高的过程；而人的创造性的劳动，最主要的还是表现在创造生产工具上。当人们开始创造出简单的手工工具，能够从事渔猎的时候，也就从一般动物的领域中解放出来，开始了原始共产主义的社会生活。当生产工具进一步发展和提高，从石器时代进入铜器时代再进入铁器时代，以及动力机器工业的出现，人类社会也就逐步由原始共产主义而进入奴隶社会、封建社会以至资本主义社会。如果说蒸气时代是资本主义时代，电气时代就是社会主义的时代。
    农业劳动生产率的高低与农业机械化、电气化成正比例
    农业劳动生产率的高低与农业机械化程度的大小成正比例。农业机械化的程度越大，农业劳动生产率也就越高。苏联所以比我国农业劳动生产率高得多，就是因为他们农业机械化程度比我国大的多。苏联早在1937年就已经基本上实现了农业机械化。到1956年，苏联已拥有一百五十万台拖拉机，平均每台拖拉机负担耕地二千一百四十亩。而我国目前农用拖拉机，只有二万六千九百台，平均每六万一千三百三十八亩才有一台拖拉机。从我国国内情况看也是如此。国营农场比人民公社机械化程度高得多，所以，国营农场每一劳动工日生产的粮食，也就比人民公社多的多。据1958年调查统计材料证明，国营农场每一劳动日生产的粮食是八十七斤，而人民公社却只有二十八斤，国营农场的农业劳动生产率比人民公社高二倍多。从具体作物的收获量来看就更明显。国营农场种植小麦的机械化程度高，因此，每个劳动工日生产小麦比人民公社产量就高九倍；在水稻方面机械化程度低，每一劳动工日只比人民公社产量高三倍。
    逐步实现农业的机械化、电气化，并达到生产过程的高度自动化，是从技术上改造我国农业的必由之路。由于我国整个国民经济的全面发展，工业化水平的迅速提高，特别是全国钢铁产量不断跃进，可以设想，我们实行较大规模的农业机械化、电气化工作已为期不远了。而且这一工作一经开始，也会以较快的速度向前发展。但是，实现农业机械化、电气化，毕竟不是短时间就可完成的，在没有实现农业机械化、电气化之前，特别是今年，还没有大量农业机械供应的情况下，能不能大大提高农业劳动生产率呢？答案也是肯定的。
    提高单位面积产量，是提高农业劳动生产率的重要途径
    首先，1958年农业生产大跃进的事实告诉我们，单位产量愈高，而用工的比例可相对减少，这已成为一个普遍的客观规律。从水稻、小麦、杂粮三种作物1957年和1958年单位面积产量、用工和每个工的产量的比较中可以清楚地看到这一点。水稻1957年亩产三百五十八斤，每亩用工十五个，每工产量二十四斤；1958年亩产六百四十三斤，用工只二十二点五个，每工产量达二十八点五斤。这就是说，产量增加了79.6％，而每亩用工只增加了50％，每工产量增加了18.8％。小麦1957年亩产一百一十四斤，每亩用工七个，每工产量十六斤；1958年亩产一百八十八斤，每亩用工十点五个，每工产量十八斤。也就是说，产量增加了65％，用工只增加了50％，每工产量增加了12.5％。杂粮1957年亩产一百三十八斤，每亩用工八点五个，每工产量十六点二斤；1958年亩产二百七十七斤，每亩用工十二点五个，每工产量二十二点一斤。也就是亩产增加一倍，用工增加47％，每工产量增加36.4％。从1958年各种作物不同产量的不同用工和每工产量来看，也可证明这一点。据六个省七个调查点水稻生产用工调查：亩产一千一百九十四斤的普通地，每亩用工三十五个，每工产量三十四斤；而亩产二千九百一十三斤的丰产地，每亩用工五十六个，每工产量五十二斤；即亩产增加144％，用工只增加60％，每工产量增加53％。山西省十九县二十一社（队）玉米生产调查：普通地亩产六百二十三斤，每亩用工十五点六个，每工产量四十斤；丰产地亩产二千五百五十八斤，每亩用工二十六点九个，每工产量九十五斤；高额丰产地亩产七千五百一十一斤，每亩用工三十点六个，每工产量二百四十五斤。普通地和丰产地比较，亩产增加310％，用工只增加72％，每工产量增加137％。普通地和高额丰产地比较，则亩产增加1105％，用工只增加96％，每工产量增加510％。陕西渭南红旗人民公社对棉花生产用工调查：普通地亩产皮棉一百四十斤，每亩用工十八点零五个，每工产量七点八斤；高额丰产地亩产一千五百三十六点三七斤，每亩用工一百一十一点六三个，每工产量十三点八斤，即亩产增加997％，用工只增加520％，每工产量增加77％。全国各地还有许多材料可以证明，单位产量愈高，每工产量也就高，而用工也就相对地减少。这是由于无论高产或低产，在某些作业项目上，单位用工不会有很大的增加，或者说基本上是固定的。产量提高了，用工虽然还是增加的，但相对地会减少。因此，精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，是提高农业劳动生产率的一条重要途径。
    提高农业劳动生产率必须见物又见人
    其次，不论生产力的发展，还是生产关系的发展，人是其中的决定因素。1958年农业生产大跃进的经验也证明，发扬人的积极性、创造性、苦干、巧干，是提高劳动生产率最有效的措施。因为，不管是改善劳动组织，改进经营管理，改革耕作制度，改良各种工具等，都离不开人的干劲。1958年由于工农业生产全面跃进，农村缺工达一千多亿个（按1957年出勤率和劳动定额计算）。由于男女整半劳力出勤率大大增加，加以改善经营管理，改进劳动组织，进一步提高了劳动效率，约计解决缺工的50％左右。大搞工具改革的群众运动，发明创造上万种农具，制造推广了三亿五千余万件，约计也解决劳动缺工的50％左右。这两方面是保证1958年工农业生产全面跃进的决定因素。但是，根据去年的经验，在这方面也有两个问题值得注意。其一是见人不见物。有人一提到发扬人的积极性，就单纯强调鼓足干劲，力争上游，过分地延长劳动时间和增加劳动强度。这种作法绝不能持久，持久了就会影响劳动者体质的健康，反而会降低了劳动生产率。其一是见物不见人。有人一提要提高劳动生产率，就是要国家供应各种各样的农业机械。这些人明知不可能立刻满足他的要求，却只是消极地等待，而不是积极地调动一切人的积极性创造性，来进行工具改革。这样，也不可能提高农业劳动生产率。客观事实证明，要提高农业劳动生产率就必须见人又见物。也就是既要苦干，又要巧干；既要发扬人的积极性；又要发扬人的创造性，既要改善劳动组织、改进经营管理、合理的调整人与人的生产关系，以调动一切人的积极性，又要创造性地改革耕作制度、改良各种生产工具，实行农业技术革命。只有人的因素和物的因素同时发掘出来，生产力和生产关系相适应的不断向前发展，才能大踏步地提高农业劳动生产率。
    1958年，我国人民在总路线的光辉照耀下鼓足干劲、力争上游，发扬了敢想敢作敢于创造的精神，破除了迷信，开展了全民全面的工具改革的群众运动，发明创造出各种工具上万种，还初步发掘和利用了水、风、沼、潮、机、电各种动力能源，不仅大大提高了劳动效率，减轻了农民繁重的劳动，缓和了农业劳动力不足的紧张情况，保证了农业八字宪法的实施，它还创造了适应我国农业生产八字宪法要求的各种高工效的工具。尤其是绳索牵引机和电犁的出现，为实现我国农业机械化、电气化提供了选型的宝库，为实现农业机械化、电气化找到了一条捷径。此外，它还培养了一批从事农业机械研究和生产制造、推广使用的专业队伍，发展了县社农业机具制造修配工业，积累了领导经验，为实现农业机械化、电气化奠定下思想、技术和物质的初步基础。事实证明，工具改革不仅是当前提高劳动生产率的一条根本措施，也是逐步地多快好省地实现农业机械化、电气化的一条根本途径。
    目前要大搞工具改革，大搞动力能源，大搞农业的半机械化
    为了进一步提高农业劳动生产率，保证1959年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进，并积极地为实现农业机械化电气化进行准备。在工具改革方面究竟应该从何处着手呢？首先要从几种主要作物的劳动用工情况来看。水稻：据湖北孝感万金社中等丰产水稻用工调查，全部耕作用工六十九点一个，其中耕、耙、锄用工七个，播种用工十二点九个，灌水用工五个，送肥、施肥用工二十个，收获用工十二点六个，其他用工十一点六个。其中送肥施肥用工最多，占全部用工28.8％，育苗播种用工占18.6％，收获用工占18.2％，三者合计占全部用工65.6％。小麦，据山西洪赵巨星三社中等丰产小麦用工调查，全部耕作用工三十八点五个，其中耕耙锄用工三点七个，播种用工一点八个，排灌用工零点八个，送肥施肥二十二个，收获用工九点三个，其他用工零点九个。其中送肥施肥用工最多，占全部用工的57.1％，收获占24.1％，二者合计占全部用工的81.2％。玉米，据山东寿张人民公社台前管理区，中等丰产玉米用工调查，全部耕作用工一百三十七点八个，其中耕耙锄用工三十五点一个，播种用工五点二个，排灌用工十九点五个，送肥施肥五十八点五个，收获用工七点八个，其他用工十一点七个。其中送肥施肥用工最多，占全部用工42.5％，耕耙锄占25.4％，排灌占14.1％，三者合计占全部用工的82％。棉花，据辽宁朝阳大屯乡五四社中等丰产棉花用工调查，全部耕作用工六十七点八个，其中耕耙锄七点三个，播种二点九个，灌水三个，送肥施肥二十二点七个，收获十八个，其他十三点九个。其中送肥施肥用工最多，占全部用工33.5％，收获占26.6％，其他田间管理占20.5％，三者合计占全部用工80.6％。从这四种作物的用工情况中不难看出，送肥施肥是占劳动量最大的，其次是收获。另外，水稻插秧，棉花田间管理，和一般地的深耕，都占用劳动量较多，而且劳动也很繁重。只要能在这些方面把工具改革工作做好，就可以节省大批劳动力，减轻农民的劳动强度，从而提高劳动生产率。
    其次，再从季节性用工情况来看。一般是春耕春种、夏收夏种和三秋季节劳动力最紧张，原因是时间短，任务紧，农事集中。如按一般的劳动定额计，在这些季节里，一般缺工在30％—50％左右。据此，工具改革还必须从季节性最强烈的各种农活着手。1958年经验证明，运输工具滚珠轴承化、胶轮化和索道化后，可提高工效几倍到十几倍；收割脱粒工具改用快速割禾器和收割机、脱粒机后，也可提高工效一倍到几倍；水稻插秧机比人工插秧也提高工效几倍到十几倍；加工工具改革后也提高工效几倍以上。分析情况，抓住重点，有领导有计划地进行大规模的工具改革，普遍推广使用，不仅可以解决季节性的劳力不足的问题，还可以几倍十几倍地提高工效。这样，把劳动生产率在现有基础上提高一倍，甚至几倍，是完全可以实现的。
    根据以上分析，不难看出，要在1959年把农业劳动生产率提高一倍左右，除了充分发挥群众的冲天干劲之外，最现实最可靠的途径，是破除迷信，发明创造，大搞工具改革，大搞动力能源，大搞农业的半机械化。1959年要靠工具改革和半机械化吃饭，这并不是对机械化、电气化的消极，这是由我国具体条件来决定的。因为实现我国的农业机械化、电气化，必须从我国的实际情况出发，不仅要适应我国各地不同自然条件和不同作物的需要，而且要符合农业生产跃进目标和农业增产八字宪法的要求。这就既要高度的机械化、电气化，达到生产过程的高度自动化，又要高度的精耕细作，贯彻高产少种多收的农业方针，逐步实现农业三三制的要求。因此，就必须从大搞工具改革着手，根据生产的实际需要批判地接受其他国家的经验，在现在工具的基础上，使制造、改进、创造相结合，边发明、边鉴定、边推广、边改进、边普及、边提高，并逐步地把木制的变成铁制的，把小型的变成大型的，把简单的变成复杂的，把低级的变成高级的，把土的变成洋的，把人力畜力的变成机械力和电力的。通过工具改革，首先实现农业半机械化，逐步实现农业机械化和电气化，是多快好省地从技术上改造我国农业的必经之路。机械化、电气化是工具改革的方向和目标，工具改革是实现农业机械化、电气化的前提和基础。1959年大抓工具改革正是为农业机械化电气化积极进行准备的。我们把工具改革称作是技术革命的萌芽，少奇同志说：“这部车轮一经开动，一年不停，一万年也不停”，正是这个道理。为了进一步发展农业生产力，把农业劳动生产率提高到一个新的水平，并积极为实现农业机械化、电气化做好准备工作，1959年必须开展一个更广泛更细致更有成效的工具改革运动。这是当前提高农业劳动生产率的一条根本途径。
