Commune Party Secretary
By our reporter Jin Feng

I. The Big Inspection

Gu Daqing, the First Secretary of the Xinglong Commune Party Committee in Yangzhong, Jiangsu Province, didn't get back to the commune from Changshu until 10:00 PM. This thin young man had led Xinglong Township to win the county's high-yield championship for two consecutive years. Last year, he became famous throughout the province for producing over 1,500 jin per mu of rice and wheat in two seasons. He even went to Beijing and met Chairman Mao. He was never complacent but was good at learning. He always saw the strengths of others, was wary of his own shortcomings, and tried everything possible to push his work forward! This time, he learned a lot in Changshu and felt that he was not as good as Changshu in many ways, which made him very anxious. When he returned to the commune, the other secretaries and members of the Standing Committee were not at home but were in the production teams inspecting production. He immediately made several phone calls, found the secretaries and Standing Committee members, and learned about the production situation in the past few days. "The wheat? The fourth application of fertilizer has been completed, and it's growing well. We've basically overcome the re-greening stage," Secretary Liu's voice sounded cheerfully on the phone. "It's just that the growth is still uneven. About 10% are still in the third category of seedlings, especially the wheat in Team Thirteen is the worst." "Team Thirteen again?!" Secretary Gu grumbled with annoyance. On the phone, he and several secretaries agreed that the whole commune would conduct a major wheat inspection the next day.

After finishing the phone calls, it was already past 12:00 AM. In the next room, the snoring of the young clerks, accountants, and messengers had already begun. Only in Secretary Gu's small room was the kerosene lamp still lit. Secretary Gu paced back and forth in the room. Producing 1,500 jin per mu of wheat this year was a heavy burden on his heart. He thought deeply, deeply: "The 10% of third-class seedlings must be eliminated through a concentrated effort! But why is Team Thirteen always the worst? That's the area under the leadership of Secretary Lu. This comrade tends to be subjective and one-sided when looking at problems. He easily becomes complacent and negligent when there are achievements and emphasizes objective factors when shortcomings occur."

Thinking about this, he felt like he had a clue and felt the weariness of a day's travel. He lay down on the bed with his clothes on and dozed off for a while. Before 3:00 AM, he suddenly woke up to see a faint white light outside the window. He quickly jumped up, grabbed the carrying pole and bamboo basket in the corner of the room, opened the door, and went straight to his experimental plot. Under the clear light of the waning crescent moon, the dozen or so mu of Yuans wheat looked dense, with thick stalks and strong leaves, making them appear even more dark and lovely. He squatted down to count the seedlings. Each plant had already sprouted six or seven leaves, and the taller ones were more than a foot high. More fertilizer was needed. He rolled up his trouser legs, went to the small river where the water had been drawn, and carried river mud to the grass mud pond at the edge of the field. He only heard a rustling sound behind him. It turned out that the clerks, accountants, and messengers were all following him, carrying river mud.

They worked until dawn, each carrying thirty to fifty loads of river mud before returning to eat breakfast. At this time, the commune Party secretaries, members of the Standing Committee, and brigade captains and secretaries had also arrived. Secretary Gu immediately led everyone to set off. They walked through one brigade after another, inspecting field after field of wheat. Obviously, most of these black, oily wheat plants had drunk their fill of water and eaten enough fertilizer, thus revealing this happy, re-greened color. Only in the hundreds of mu of wheat in Team Thirteen did Secretary Gu see thin stems and weak leaves, and the wheat seedlings' color was yellowish, indicating a lack of fertilizer. Secretary Lu's face was also very unhappy. Many brigade captains were also discussing the situation. In this assessment, Team Thirteen had once again fallen behind.

II. Clash of Ideas

That night, the Xinglong Commune Standing Committee held a meeting. The members of the Standing Committee were in a somber mood. The young Secretary Gu had always been mild-tempered, but tonight, his face became stern, and he relentlessly launched an ideological struggle. First, he examined himself: "...My leadership work is generally average, about the same as last year. But last year, we only harvested 1,500 jin in the whole year, and this year, we want to get 1,500 jin in one season! The Party has given us such a glorious task. What kind of enthusiasm do we use to respond to the expectations of the Party and the people? ...In Changshu, the commune Party committees divide up areas of responsibility and strive to achieve results, constantly improving the commune's production level wave after wave. But what about us? Some people are satisfied with the little achievement of last year and have stopped moving forward..."

At this time, Secretary Lu felt extremely uncomfortable. He remorsefully examined himself: "My work is superficial. I become complacent and negligent with a little achievement and fail to further overcome shortcomings. The Party Committee sounded the alarm twice, but I didn't humbly accept it. Only this time did I suddenly wake up ideologically. If I don't seriously correct myself, I will really drag the commune down!"

By the time the meeting adjourned, it was already midnight. Secretary Lu rushed back that night, went barefoot into the fields, and worked with the commune members to carry manure, apply fertilizer, and dig ditches. A week later, the color of the wheat changed, becoming green and lush, already catching up to the color of first-class seedlings.

III. On-Site Meeting

Concentrating efforts to overcome difficulties, focusing on weak links to balance imbalances, this was a leadership method that Secretary Gu used very skillfully. When Team Thirteen had indeed caught up, the commune Party committee decided to hold an on-site meeting there to encourage and consolidate its progress and to spur other brigades forward.

It was raining, and the ground was muddy, but everyone was in high spirits as they waded through the mud. These production brigades were both fiercely competitive and full of genuine brotherly affection. Everyone was happy to see that the wheat in Team Thirteen had changed color, and the drainage ditches were dug very well. Water was flowing from the small ditches in the fields and the large ditches at the edges of the fields into the river leading to the Yangtze River.

It seemed that the commune's wheat had overcome the re-greening stage! Despite running through mud and water all morning in the wind and rain, these brigade captains were all energetic and cheerfully talking and laughing loudly, surrounded by a sense of accomplishment. The shrewd and capable Secretary Gu immediately put forward new action requirements at the meeting: while continuing to apply fertilizer to the wheat, also focus on applying base fertilizer for the large harvest, accumulating 800 dan per mu within a week! A knowing smile appeared on the faces of the captains: This Secretary Gu, he just doesn't let people relax! Well, they have become accustomed to this kind of intense leadership and are also happy to accept such leadership! They and Secretary Gu analyzed the favorable and difficult conditions, calculated the fertilizer and labor accounts, and each returned to their teams with an excited and happy heart, treading through even deeper mud.

We must continue to focus on fertilizer, especially on local fertilizer, this was the conclusion of the meeting. Other teams were producing it in large quantities, but Team Eleven had not yet opened up the situation. Although it was already completely dark, Secretary Gu still rushed to Team Eleven to discuss with Acting Secretary Shi Rulin: "Comrade, if you want to catch a dragon, you have to go into the sea yourself. If we want to achieve 1,500 jin, we have to work harder!" A meeting of commune members was called, and they immediately began to set up eight local fertilizer plants overnight. As a result, the entire commune's more than 500 local fertilizer plants could produce more than 2 million jin of local fertilizer every day!

IV. When All Sides are Praising

Braving the wind and rain, Secretary Gu went to the famous advanced team, Team Ten. This was originally the Fude Advanced Cooperative. Its output reached more than 800 jin in 1956 and 1957, and it even harvested more than 2,000 jin in 1958, making it very famous in Jiangsu Province. This was also a key area of leadership for the county Party committee and Secretary Gu. When work was generally balanced, he always went to this team first to make a breakthrough, creating new imbalances to promote the overall situation. Deep plowing, close planting, top dressing, and drainage, this team was ahead in everything.

The wheat here did grow very well, all neatly and uniformly, thick and strong, with more than 800,000 to 900,000 seedlings, still showing strength in the wind and rain. Team Leader Wang Xianwen had a faint look of satisfaction on his face. He thought that even the strict Secretary Gu would have to praise them a few times. However, Secretary Gu's brows gradually furrowed. "You have been the leading team for three consecutive years. Do you want to continue to be the leading team this year?" Secretary Gu chatted with the commune members who were resting and suddenly raised this question. Wang Xianwen couldn't help but be surprised and pricked up his ears to listen carefully. Secretary Gu continued: "Although your wheat is good, several plots in Team Nine are stronger than yours, and they have caught up. What are their conditions? The land is lower-lying than yours, and they don't have as much fertilizer as you. You are the focus of the commune, and you have been given 4,000 jin of chemical fertilizer alone! If you don't work harder, how can you justify it? Besides," he looked at the wheat rows and said, "there is still standing water in your ditches. This is a serious problem. Tomorrow morning, you should go and see the wheat in Team Nine!" The commune members and team leader were silent. Only the straightforward old man Wei Xicai took a few puffs of his dry tobacco pipe and said loudly: "I saw that people kept coming to visit our team, and I thought our team was always about the same. Who knew we were sitting in a well, looking at the sky, praising ourselves. I'm afraid that after seeing others tomorrow, our minds will be opened!" Wang Xianwen turned around and hurriedly went to convene a meeting of the team cadres without saying a word. The commune members also quickly went down to the fields to pump water. Secretary Gu smiled secretly: What good commune members and cadres, as long as you point them out a little, they will take action immediately! He just made up his mind that when all sides are praising them, he must pay attention to finding their shortcomings, finding their loopholes, and sounding the alarm for them, so that they don't fall asleep. In this era where one day is equal to twenty years, the speed of movement has accelerated, and we really can't be careless!

V. Continue Fighting

It had been raining for two days and two nights, and the groundwater level rose rapidly, with some places only a foot below the ground. Secretary Gu was very anxious, as if facing a formidable enemy. That night, he again gathered the commune Party committee members to jointly study the current emergency measures.

"We must immediately lower the groundwater level to below three feet, otherwise, we will definitely suffer!" Secretary Gu analyzed the enemy's situation: "Last year, because the groundwater level was high, the wheat got scab and we lost one-third of the yield. We must not repeat this lesson under any circumstances!" He deployed the battle like a commander: "All the waterwheels are going into action. Pump water when it rains, pump water at night, don't let the wheels rest while the people rest, complete the blitz in three days. One production team leader said it well: 'If the waterwheel doesn't go down, we have to scoop it out with our hands!' Yes, we must have that kind of spirit! We must continue to focus on fertilizer, with fertilizer, we have grain! But when the sun comes out, wheat aphids will come out, and we must also prevent pests and diseases in time. After we have overcome the re-greening stage, we must also get through the jointing stage, prevent pests and diseases, prevent lodging, and ensure the harvest, continue fighting until we get 1,500 jin in our hands. At present, we must not only eliminate the third category of seedlings but also eliminate the second category of seedlings. If the factory can guarantee that all products are first-class, why can't we all have first-class seedlings?"

The meeting was very intense. While the meeting was going on, the secretaries and members of the Standing Committee who were responsible for different areas kept calling the teams to arrange work. The phone rang constantly.

The meeting ended at twelve o'clock. At three o'clock in the morning, the fields were noisy with people, whistles, and songs. The masses had already taken action. The masses had already gotten on the waterwheels. Secretary Gu naturally couldn't sleep anymore. He ran to the fields, climbed onto the waterwheel, and energetically treaded the waterwheel with several young men. The water spun quickly, rolling from the fields into the river. Looking at the wheat fields that were gradually drying up, Secretary Gu was again considering the next battle.

    公社书记
    本报记者　金凤
    一、大检查
    江苏省扬中兴隆公社党委第一书记顾大庆从常熟赶回社里，已经是夜晚十点钟了。这个瘦瘦的年轻人，接连两年领导兴隆乡夺得全县的高产冠军，去年又以稻麦两季亩产一千五百多斤闻名全省，上了北京，见了毛主席。他绝不自满，却善于学习。他总是看到别人的长处，警惕自己的不足，想尽一切办法把工作赶到前面去！这次他到常熟，学了不少东西，自觉得有许多地方不如常熟，心中很着急。赶回社里，公社的另外几个书记和常委都不在家，都到队里检查生产去了。他马上摇了几个电话，找到书记和常委们，了解这几天的生产情况。“麦子吗，第四次肥已追下去，长得不错，返青关基本上闯过来啦”，刘书记的声音在电话里愉快地响着：“只是生长得还不平衡，三类苗还有10％左右，特别是十三队的麦子最差。”“又是十三队？！”顾书记烦恼地咕噜一声。在电话里，他和几个书记商量好了：第二天全公社进行麦子大检查。
    电话打完，已是深夜十二点多。隔壁房间里，已经响起文书、会计和通讯员这几个年轻人的熟睡的鼾声。只有顾书记的小屋内，煤油灯还亮着。顾书记在屋内不住地踱来踱去。麦子今年要亩产一千五百斤，这重担紧紧压在他的心上。他深深地思索着，思索着：“10％的三类苗，一定要突击消灭掉！只是，为什么总是十三队最差？那是陆书记负责领导的地方。这个同志看问题就是主观片面些，有了成绩容易松劲麻痹，发生缺点就强调客观。”
    想到这里，事情有个头绪了，他才感到赶了一天路程的倦意。他和衣躺到床上，迷糊了一会。不到三点，他瞿然惊醒，只见窗外白茫茫的微光。他赶紧跳了起来，拿了放在屋角的扁担篾箩，就开门出去，直奔他那试验田的地头。在下弦月的清光下，那十几亩元麦看来密密层层地，秆粗叶壮，越发显得乌沉沉的可爱。他蹲下来数数麦苗，每棵已分了六七瓣叶子，高的有一尺多了。还得追肥。他卷起裤腿，到车干了水的小河边挑起河泥，送到田头的草泥塘里。只听到身后吃吃嚓嚓一片声响，原来是文书、会计和通讯员都跟在他后面挑河泥来了。
    干到天亮，各人挑了有三五十担河泥，才回来吃早饭。这时，公社的党委书记、常委，大队的队长、支书也都来齐了。顾书记马上带领大伙出发。他们走过一个大队又一个大队，检查了一片又一片的麦田。显然，这些黑油油的麦子大多喝饱了水，吃足了肥，这才露出这样一种喜孜孜的闯过返青关的颜色。只有十三大队的几百亩麦子，顾书记看到茎细叶弱，麦苗颜色泛黄，这是肥料不足的表现。陆书记的脸色也很不愉快。许多大队长也在议论纷纷。这次评比的结果，十三队又一次落后了。
    二、思想交锋
    当天夜里，兴隆公社的常委会开会了。常委们的心情都很沉重。年轻的顾书记脾气一向温和，但今天晚上，他的脸色变得严峻起来，毫不容情地展开了思想斗争。首先他是检查自己：“……自己领导工作一般化，和去年差不多。可是去年全年不过收一千五百来斤，今年一季就要拿它一千五百斤！党以这样光荣的任务交给我们，我们用什么样的干劲来回答党和人民的期望呢？……在常熟，人家公社党委分工包片，争先搞出成绩来，一浪逐一浪的不断提高公社的生产水平。而我们呢？却有人满足于去年的那一点点成就，停住脚步了。……”
    这时候，陆书记难受极了，他沉痛地检讨自己：“工作浮浅，有一点成绩就自满松劲，不进一步克服缺点。党委敲了两次警钟，自己还不虚心接受，直到这次思想上才猛省过来。再不认真改过，真要拉公社的后腿了！”
    散会的时候，已经半夜。陆书记连夜赶了回去，赤脚下田，和社员们一起挑粪、追肥、挖沟。一星期后，麦子的颜色转过来了，青苍苍地，已经赶得上一类苗的成色。
    三、现场会议
    突击困难，突击薄弱环节，使不平衡的达到平衡，这是顾书记运用得很熟练的领导方法。在十三队果然赶了上来的时候，公社党委就决定在那里召开现场会议，鼓励和巩固他的进步，鞭策其他大队的前进。
    天上正下着雨，地上一片泥泞，但大家踩着泥水兴致很高。这些生产大队之间一方面竞赛得很激烈，一方面又充满真正的手足之情。大家高兴地看到十三队麦子都转过颜色；排水沟也挖得很好，水正顺着田里的小沟、田头的大沟流到通江的港里去。
    看来，公社的麦子的返青关是闯过来了！尽管在风雨里拖泥带水跑了一上午，这些大队长一个个精神焕发，兴致勃勃地大声谈笑着，有一种完成任务的轻松感觉包围着他们。精明强干的顾书记在会上马上提出新的行动要求：一面抓麦子追肥，一面抓大熟基肥，一星期内积足每亩八百担！队长们脸上都透出会心的微笑：看这顾书记，就不让人松一口气！也好，他们已经习惯这种紧张的领导，也很乐意接受这样的领导！他们和顾书记一起分析了有利的和困难的条件，算清了肥料账和劳力账，各自带着一颗兴奋而又愉快的心，踏着更深的泥泞赶回队里。
    要继续抓肥料，特别要抓土化肥，这是会上的结论。别的队都在大量制造了，就是十一队还打不开局面。天虽然已经全黑，顾书记还是赶到十一队，和代理书记石如林一块商量：“伙计，要擒龙亲自下海，要实现一千五百斤，咱们得加劲干哪！”社员会议召开了，连夜就动手建立起八个土化肥厂。这一来，全公社五百多个土化肥厂每天能生产二百多万斤土化肥！
    四、当四面叫好的时候
    冒着风雨，顾书记走到了著名的先进队第十队。这里原来是福德高级社，1956、1957年产量就达到八百多斤，1958年更收到二千多斤，在江苏省也很有名。这里也是县委和顾书记的领导重点。当工作大致平衡的时候，他总是先到这个队来突破一点，造成新的不平衡，来推动全局。深翻、密植、追肥、排水，这个队样样工作走在头里。
    这里的麦子长得也确实好，一色崭齐，粗粗壮壮，有八九十万苗以上，在风雨中依然显得威势。队长王贤文脸上显出隐约的得意。他想，就是要求严格的顾书记也要夸赞几句吧。但是，顾书记的眉头却渐渐皱了起来。“你们连着三年当老大哥，今年要不要继续当呢？”顾书记和正在休息的社员一起聊天，忽然提出了这个问题。王贤文不由得大吃一惊，竖起耳朵留心听着。顾书记继续说：“你们的麦子虽则不错，但是九大队有几块比你们还强，人家可是赶上来了。人家是什么条件？地比你们洼，肥料没你们多。你们是公社的重点，光化肥就给了四千斤！你们再不加劲，能说得过去吗？再说，”他打量了一下麦垅说：“你们沟里还有积水呀，这就是严重问题。明天一早你们去看看九大队的麦子吧！”社员和队长都沉默下来，只有魏锡才老汉心直口快，他猛吸了几口旱烟，大声说：“我看到不断有人来参观我们队，我寻思我们队总是差不多咧。谁知是坐井观天，自称自赞。只怕明天去看看别人的，脑筋就开窍啦！”王贤文一言不发，匆匆转身去召集队干部商议去了，社员们也都赶紧下田车水。顾书记暗暗笑着：多么好的社员和干部啊，只要稍一指点，马上行动起来！他只是拿定主意，当四面给他们叫好时，就要注意找他们的缺点，找他们的漏洞，给他们敲敲警钟，不叫他们睡着了。在这一天等于二十年的时代，运动速度加快了，实在马虎不得一点！
    五、连续战斗下去
    连下了两天两夜雨，地下水位迅速上升，有的离地面只有一尺。顾书记十分焦急，如临大敌。这天夜里，他又召集了公社的党委常委们，共同研究当前的紧急措施。
      “必须马上降低地下水位到三尺以下，不然一定要吃亏！”顾书记分析着敌情：“去年就因为地下水位高，麦子得了赤霉病，损失了三分之一的产量。这个教训无论如何不能重复！”他像指挥员似的部署着战斗：“所有的水车都上阵，下雨车，黑夜也车，歇人不歇车，三天突击完毕。有个生产队长说得好：‘水车不下去，用手也要掏干！’对，就要有这样的气魄！肥料还要继续抓，有肥就有粮！可是出了太阳，麦蚜虫又要出来，病虫害也要及时防止。返青关过了，我们还要过好拔节关，防止病虫害，防止倒伏，保证收割，连续战斗下去，一直到一千五百斤拿到手里。目前，我们不仅要消灭三类苗，也要消灭二类苗。工厂能保证全出一级品，我们为什么不能都是一类苗？”
    会议开得很紧张。一面开会，分片包干的书记和常委一面不断往队里打电话，布置工作，电话铃不断地响着。
    会开到十二点才结束。清早三点，田野里人声喧哗，哨子声，歌声响成一片。群众已经行动起来，群众已经上了水车。顾书记自然早已睡不着了，他跑到地里，奔上水车，和几个小伙子一起有劲地踏着水车。水，飞快地旋转着，从田里滚向河里。顾书记望着渐渐干下去的麦田，又在考虑着下一步的战役。
