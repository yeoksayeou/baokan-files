Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: A mass movement centered on technological revolution has unfolded in coal mines across the country. To further clarify the main direction of the technological revolution and promote a deeper development of the movement, the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to promote thirty-six major advanced experiences this year. This will better organize and unleash the wisdom and enthusiasm of millions of coal miners nationwide, ensuring that the national coal-seizing campaign this year achieves greater, faster, and more economical results.

The thirty-six experiences proposed by the Ministry of Coal are the crystallization of technical experiences from the Great Leap Forward in China's coal industry in 1958, as well as technical experiences accumulated in recent years. Twelve of these relate to raw coal production, nine to capital construction, four to coal washing, and the remainder to geological exploration and mechanical manufacturing.

Information provided by the Ministry of Coal indicates that the twelve experiences related to raw coal production are the main way to achieve large-scale bountiful harvests and greater leaps in raw coal this year. The existing production mines (excluding open-pit mines) under the Ministry of Coal will increase raw coal production by nearly 50 million tons this year, equivalent to the output of fifty newly built mines each producing one million tons of coal annually. Increasing production by such a large amount relies mainly on promoting the above twelve advanced experiences to tap production potential. Facts have proven that these experiences played a significant role in increasing raw coal production during the Great Leap Forward last year.

Among the twelve experiences related to raw coal production, some are about shortening auxiliary time and increasing pure coal mining time. The experience of multi-cycle parallel cross-operation with four shifts for coal extraction, created by Fengfeng No. 4 Mine in Hebei Province, can increase the time for coal extraction from each working face by nearly one-third per day. In the past, coal mines generally had two shifts for coal mining and one shift for preparation work. This meant that one-third of the time each day could not be used for coal extraction due to preparation work. Some people say that the experience of four-shift cross-operation is an experience that "turns every day into thirty-two hours," because workers in each shift (eight hours) start work two hours before the previous shift ends to do preparation work. This can increase the effective coal mining time by one-third compared to the past. The experience of integral rapid scraper conveyor moving created by the Xuzhou Mining Bureau in Jiangsu Province has reduced the time for each scraper conveyor move from five or six hours in the past to one hour, greatly increasing pure coal mining time as well. How to reduce the time spent on moving scraper conveyors in sections and strive to increase pure coal mining time is an important issue in the research and solution of coal mining technology in various countries in recent years. Some countries use more complex equipment such as hydraulic jacks to move the scraper conveyors. The experience of integral scraper conveyor moving created by the Jiawang Mine of the Xuzhou Mining Bureau is an innovation in this regard. They do not need to add equipment, but only use the pulling force of the winch used to recover pillars to quickly move it to the required location (mines where conditions are not available have experience in rapid scraper conveyor moving in sections), which not only reduces the time for moving the scraper conveyor, but also greatly reduces heavy manual labor.

Increasing the progress of the coal mining working face and striving to improve labor efficiency is a very important link to ensure a large-scale bumper harvest of raw coal production this year. Several of the twelve experiences related to raw coal production that the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to promote are experiences in this area. For example, the Hongshan Coal Mine of the Zibo Mining Bureau increased the cutting disc used for coal cutting on the coal cutting machine from 1.8 meters to 2.8 meters, which increased the daily output of the coal mining working face by 63% and labor efficiency by 94%. The experience of using the "one-shot one-knife" method to increase the footage (the width of each coal dig along the working face) of each cycle, created by Yangquan No. 2 Mine in Shanxi Province, reduced the number of times the coal conveyor is moved, the number of times the coal is cut, and the amount of coal loading work. The monthly coal mining progress of the working face increased from 40 meters to 60 meters, the number of people in the working face decreased from 64 to 47, and the labor efficiency of each coal miner increased by 82.8%. These experiences are major reforms in coal production methods by Chinese coal miners during the Great Leap Forward last year. It does not require the addition of new equipment, but can significantly increase the output of the working face.

Among the twelve experiences in raw coal production, there is also the experience of rapid tunneling in Hanqiao Coal Mine. This is an effective way to reverse the situation where the preparation work for new working faces lags behind production. This experience mainly involves adopting deep-hole blasting and multi-cycle operations, as well as parallel operations for drilling, loading explosives, loading cars, and supporting pillars. Last year, the Zhuang Hongsheng group of Hanqiao Mine adopted this experience, and the monthly progress reached 1,065 meters in July, compared with 466 meters in the past. The general tunneling efficiency of coal mines nationwide last year was about 200 meters per month. The contrast between these two figures shows the great significance of this experience. The experiences to be promoted this year also include experiences that the Party and the state have always been concerned about, such as reducing heavy manual labor for workers, as well as experiences related to saving timber, accelerating transportation, hydraulic mining, and safe production.

The nine experiences in capital construction that the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to promote this year are the main contents of the technological revolution in coal industry capital construction this year. The promotion of these experiences will play a significant role in carrying out the mass rapid construction movement in coal mines. Among these nine experiences, the important ones include the experience of drilling blast holes in the Quantai vertical shaft of Jiawang Mine, the experience of Quantai and Xuecun vertical shafts of Fengfeng Mine in accelerating the loading of rocks to the ground, and the experience of using wall-less shaft lining. The experience of drilling blast holes in the Quantai vertical shaft involves increasing the drilling speed by using several wind drills simultaneously and increasing the wind pressure of the wind drills as much as possible during tunneling to shorten the time for the drilling process. On the other hand, it also increases the diameter of the blast holes and improves the blasting efficiency to reduce the number of drilling holes. The experience of Quantai and Xuecun in accelerating the loading and transportation of rocks is to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, that is, to change from using one rock grabber in the past to using several rock grabbers working simultaneously. At present, shaft lining in China is generally built by setting up a wall seat after each small section is built to prevent the shaft wall from collapsing. This method requires a large amount of tunneling work and a long shaft lining time. The method of wall-less shaft lining shortens the working time of shaft lining, increases the working time of tunneling, and the quality of the shaft is fully in line with technical requirements. Last year, the Quantai vertical shaft of Jiawang Mine used the above-mentioned advanced experience and created the highest national record of 260 meters per month for completed shaft (including tunneling and shaft lining). The average monthly progress of the shaft from start to completion was more than 70 meters, which was 175% higher than the national average monthly progress of completed shaft last year, thus becoming a red banner in China's coal mine construction last year. The Xuecun vertical shaft of Fengfeng Mine adopted the above-mentioned experience in construction, and also achieved a high record of 142 meters per month for completed shaft in January this year. These facts prove that if all mines can promote the above-mentioned experience, a higher speed will appear in China's coal mine construction this year.

In terms of coal washing, four major advanced experiences will be promoted this year, some of which are experiences in accelerating the construction of coal washing plants, and some of which are experiences in tapping the potential of existing coal washing plants. In terms of production, the main focus this year is on promoting the experience of changing the vertical air valve of the jig used for coal washing to a horizontal air valve. According to relevant engineers, the use of horizontal air valves is a new technology. At present, most of the jigs used for coal washing in China use vertical air valves. Last year, four coal washing plants in China completely or partially switched to horizontal air valves. The processing capacity of raw coal using horizontal air valves in the Sanbao Coal Washing Plant in Beipiao was doubled compared to the original vertical air valves. The water used to process each ton of raw coal was reduced by half, and the electricity consumption was also reduced accordingly. The quality of coal washing is the same as using vertical air valves. Changing from vertical air valves to horizontal air valves only requires 250 kilograms of steel and 80 kilograms of non-ferrous metals, and the transformation technology is relatively simple. Although other processes such as transportation and power equipment need to be modified accordingly after such a transformation, it is still faster, more effective, and economically reasonable than building a new plant. For a small number of coal washing plants that do not use jigs but use trough washing machines, the experience of grading and washing lump coal and fine coal in the Fushun Laohutai Coal Washing Plant will be promoted. The Laohutai Coal Washing Plant adopted this method, and the processing capacity of raw coal was increased by about one time.

Currently, the Ministry of Coal Industry and local coal mines are taking a series of measures to promote these thirty-six experiences so that they can play a role in production and construction more quickly. To this end, the Ministry of Coal Industry has included the promotion of these experiences in the evaluation content of the national coal mine large-scale bountiful harvest red flag competition, and is preparing to hold a series of on-site meetings to vigorously organize the promotion.

    煤炭部向全国煤矿职工指明技术革命的主攻方向
    推广三十六项先进经验
    巧夺三亿八千万吨原煤
    新华社27日讯　以技术革命为中心的群众运动已经在全国煤矿展开。为了使技术革命的主攻方向更加明确，并且促进运动更深入地发展，煤炭工业部决定今年推广三十六项重大的先进经验。这样作，将会更好地组织和发挥全国数百万煤矿职工的智慧和积极性，保证全国今年的夺煤大战收到更大、更快、更经济的效果。
    煤炭部提出的三十六项经验，是1958年我国煤炭工业大跃进中的技术经验和近几年积累的技术经验的结晶。其中有十二项是属于原煤生产方面的，九项是基本建设方面的，四项是洗煤方面的，其它是地质勘探和机械制造方面的。
    煤炭部提供的情况表明，原煤生产方面的十二项经验，是今年原煤获得大面积丰产和实现更大跃进的主要途径。煤炭部现有的生产矿井（露天矿除外），今年将增产原煤近五千万吨，即相当于新建五十个年产煤一百万吨的矿井所生产的煤。增产这样多的煤，主要靠推广上述十二项先进经验来挖掘生产潜力。事实证明，这些经验在去年大跃进中对于原煤增产都曾发挥了巨大作用。
    在有关原煤生产的十二项经验中，有一部分是缩短辅助时间增加纯采煤时间的经验。河北省峰峰四矿创造的多循环平行交叉作业四班出煤的经验，可以使每个工作面每天出煤的时间增加将近三分之一。过去各煤矿一般都是两班采煤，一班作准备工作。这样每天就有三分之一的时间因作准备工作而不能出煤。四班交叉作业的经验，有人说它是“把每天变成了三十二小时”的经验；因为每班（八小时）的工人，在上一班工人下班以前两小时就上班作准备工作。这样作，可以使有效采煤时间比过去增加三分之一。江苏省徐州矿务局创造的整体快速移溜子的经验，使每次移动溜子的时间，由过去五、六小时减到了一小时，也大大增加了纯采煤时间。如何减少因分段移动溜子而耗费的时间，力争增加纯采煤时间，是近年来各国采煤技术方面研究解决的一个重要问题。有的国家是采用液压千斤顶等比较复杂的设备来移动溜子。徐州矿务局贾汪矿创造的整体移溜子的经验，在这方面是一个创举。他们不需增加设备，只利用回收支柱用的绞车的牵引力就可以迅速地把它移动到需要的地方（条件不具备的矿有分段快速移溜子的经验），不仅减少了移溜子的时间，而且也大大减轻了笨重的体力劳动。
    加大采煤工作面进度，努力提高劳动效率，是保证今年原煤生产获得大面积丰收的一个极重要的环节。煤炭工业部决定推广的十二项有关原煤生产的经验中，有好几项是这方面的经验。例如淄博矿务局洪山煤矿把截煤机上用来割煤的截盘，从一点八公尺加长到二点八公尺，使采煤工作面日产量提高了63％，劳动效率提高了94％。山西省阳泉二矿创造的用“一炮一刀”的方法加大每个循环进尺（沿着工作面每次挖煤的宽度）的经验，减少了移动运煤溜子的次数、截煤的次数和装煤的工作量，工作面每月采煤进度由四十公尺提高到了六十公尺，工作面由六十四人减少到了四十七人，每个采煤工人的劳动效率提高了82.8％。这些经验都是我国煤炭职工在去年大跃进中，在煤炭生产方法上的重大改革。它不需要增添新的设备，就能显著地提高工作面的产量。
    在十二项原煤生产经验中，还有韩桥煤矿的快速掘进的经验。这是扭转新工作面的准备工作落后于生产的有效方法。这个经验主要是采取深孔爆破和多循环作业以及打眼、装炮、装车和支柱等工作平行作业。韩桥矿庄洪生小组去年采用这经验，7月份曾由过去月进四六六公尺达到一○六五公尺，而全国煤矿去年一般的掘进效率是月进二百公尺左右。这两个数字的对比，显示了这个经验的巨大意义。在今年要推广的经验中，还有党和国家一直关心的关于减轻工人笨重体力劳动的经验，以及有关节省木材、加快运输、水力采煤和安全生产方面的经验等。
    煤炭工业部决定今年推广的九项基本建设方面的经验，是煤炭工业基本建设方面今年进行技术革命的主要内容。这些经验的推广，对于煤矿开展大面积快速施工运动将起很大作用。在这九项经验中，重要的有贾汪矿权台竖井打炮眼的经验，权台和峰峰矿薛村竖井加快向地面装载岩石的经验，以及采用无壁座砌井的经验。权台竖井打炮眼的经验，一方面是在掘进时尽可能地同时多用几台风钻打眼和加大风钻的风压，来提高打眼速度，缩短打眼工序的时间，另一方面又加大炮眼的直径，提高爆破效率，来减少打眼的数目，权台和薛村加快装运岩石的经验，是学习苏联的先进经验，即由过去一般用一台抓岩机改为用几台抓岩机同时工作。目前我国砌筑竖井井筒一般都是每砌一小节就要打个壁座，以防井壁坍塌。这种作法掘进工作量大，砌井时间长。无壁座砌井的方法，缩短了砌井的工作时间，增加了掘进的工作时间，而且井筒质量完全合乎技术要求。贾汪矿权台竖井去年采用上述先进经验曾创造了月进成井（包括掘进和砌井）二百六十公尺的全国最高纪录，这个井从开工到竣工平均月进成井七十多公尺，比去年全国平均月进成井速度提高了175％，因此成为去年我国煤矿建设中的一面红旗。峰峰矿薛村竖井采用上述经验施工，今年1月也达到了月进成井一百四十二公尺的高纪录。这些事实证明，如果各矿都能推广上述经验，我国今年煤矿的建设，将会出现更高的速度。
    在洗煤方面，今年要推广四项重大的先进经验，有的是加快建设洗煤厂的经验，有的是挖掘现有洗煤厂的潜力的经验。在生产方面，今年主要是推广把洗煤用的跳汰机的立式风阀改为卧式风阀的经验。据有关的工程师说，采用卧式风阀是一项新技术，目前我国洗煤用的跳汰机大都是立式风阀。去年我国已有四个洗煤厂全部或部分改用卧式风阀。北票三宝洗煤厂采用卧式风阀比原来用立式风阀处理原煤的能力提高了一倍，处理每吨原煤所用的水减少了一半，电的消耗量也相应的减少了。洗煤的质量和用立式风阀一样。由立式风阀改为卧式风阀，只需要二百五十公斤钢铁和八十公斤有色金属，改造的技术也比较简单。虽然经过这样的改造，其它工序如运输和动力等设备也需要相应的改造，但比建设新厂仍然收效快、收效大、经济合理。对少数不是用跳汰机而是用槽洗机的洗煤厂，将推广抚顺老虎台洗煤厂把块煤和末煤分级入洗的经验。老虎台洗煤厂采用这种方法，处理原煤的能力提高了一倍左右。
    现在，煤炭工业部和各地煤矿，正在采取一系列的措施推广这三十六项经验，以便使它更快地在生产建设上发挥作用。为此，煤炭工业部已把推广这些经验的情况列入了全国煤矿大面积丰产红旗竞赛的评比内容之一，并且准备召开一系列的现场会议，大张旗鼓地组织推广。（附图片）
