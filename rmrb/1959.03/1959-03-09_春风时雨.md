    Spring Breeze and Timely Rain
    Zhai Wen
    I was deeply moved after reading the article "New Teacher-Student Relationship Encourages Us to Move Forward" written by Mr. Deng Guangming et al., published in the People's Daily on February 28th. This is an article that reflects objective reality and is very enlightening.
    In universities, a new teacher-student relationship that is in harmony with the new look of the motherland has emerged. This is a relationship of mutual love and shared growth in teaching and learning. This relationship is not only a force that encourages teachers and students to work together under the leadership of the Party but also a force that promotes the faster intellectualization of the working people.
    The teacher-student relationship is the relationship between teaching and learning, and the two are a unity of opposites. Originally, teachers and students should love each other, and teaching and learning should grow together. Only when teachers and students love each other can teaching and learning truly grow together. However, in the old society, there were very few cases of genuine love between teachers and students, so shared growth in teaching and learning was generally only an ideal. In feudal society, as Mr. Deng and others said, teachers and students were united by fictitious ethical relationships. This kind of union, of course, rarely talked about true love between teachers and students. In capitalist society, as Mr. Deng and others said, teachers and students were mainly united by commodity relationships. This relationship was controlled by fame and profit, and it was equally rare to talk about true love between teachers and students. Therefore, whether in feudal society or capitalist society, generally speaking, there could be no talk of genuine love between teachers and students, and examples of shared growth in teaching and learning were generally rare. In the years after liberation, the socialist line in universities has been constantly defeating the capitalist line, and the proletarian ideology has been constantly defeating the bourgeois ideology. In the continuous struggle between these two lines and two ideologies, the relationship between teachers and students has also been constantly changing. However, before the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the educational revolution, this change was not significant, because before that, the political and ideological outlook of the schools had not undergone fundamental changes. After the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and especially after the educational revolution, the Party's leadership over universities was further consolidated and strengthened, and the Party's mass line was further developed from mass movements. The revolution brought about profound changes in all aspects, and the teacher-student relationship has also undergone significant changes. The degree of change is directly proportional to the degree of progress in the political ideology of teachers and students. The revolution linked people's emotions together. The union of teachers and students is no longer a union of fictitious ethical relationships, nor is it a union of commodity exchange relationships, but rather a flesh-and-blood connection, mutual respect and love. This is a great and pure love that can only be produced in the socialist era.
    We say it is great because the starting point of mutual love is the magnificent socialist construction cause. Both demand of each other to become new communist people as soon as possible; we say it is pure because it is a brand-new, equal, comradely relationship. Everyone is equal before the truth, and everyone is equal before mistakes. Everyone, whether teacher or student, must adhere to and obey the truth. Everyone, whether teacher or student, must correct and criticize mistakes. This is genuine comradely concern and comradely love. When teachers see the shortcomings of students, they put them forward sternly, hoping that students will become new communist people as soon as possible. When students see the shortcomings of teachers, they point them out sincerely, also hoping that teachers will become comprehensive, both red and expert, working-class intellectuals. With this mutual care, how can teaching and learning not grow together? This close relationship can strengthen and consolidate the leading role of teachers in teaching. The creativity of teachers in teaching can be further developed. They can truly assume the responsibility of "imparting knowledge, teaching skills, and resolving doubts." They will actively consider the difficulties students encounter in learning, and they will be happy to study and solve the difficult problems raised by students together. They will be happy to see that some of the students' views surpass their own. They will also consider the criticisms and opinions put forward by students from the standpoint of seeking help. Students will therefore love teachers more, respect teachers more, and earnestly learn from the strengths of teachers. Everyone will be honest with each other, meet each other with sincerity, and freely debate for the sake of exploring the truth.
    The ancients praised teachers, often using words such as "like sitting in the spring breeze, like being moistened by timely rain." In our opinion, only today, with the Party's light shining and the pure comradely love between teachers and students, is there true spring breeze and timely rain!

    2月28日人民日报上发表了邓广铭先生等写的
  “新的师生关系鼓舞着我们前进”一文，读后很感动。这是一篇反映了客观实际，很有启发性的文章。
    在高等学校里，现在出现了和祖国新面貌相适应的新的师生关系，这是一种师生相爱、教学相长的关系，这种关系不仅是鼓舞师生共同在党的领导下携手前进的一种力量，而且是促进劳动人民更迅速地走向知识化的一种力量。
    师生关系就是教与学的关系，两者是对立的统一。本来师生应该相爱，教学应该相长。也只有师生相爱，教学才能真正相长。但在旧社会里，师生之间能真正谈得上相爱的是很少的，所以教学相长一般说也只是一种理想。在封建社会，诚如邓先生等所说，师生是依靠虚构的伦常关系的结合。这种结合，当然是很少谈到真正的师生相爱。在资本主义社会也诚如邓先生等所说，师生主要是商品关系的结合，这种关系是为名利所左右的，同样是很少谈到真正的师生相爱。所以不论在封建社会也好，资本主义社会也好，师生间一般地说既不能谈到真正相爱，教学相长的事例一般说也是很少的。在解放以后的年代，高等学校中社会主义路线在不断战胜资本主义路线，无产阶级的思想也在不断战胜资产阶级思想，就在这两条路线两种思想的不断斗争中，师生之间的关系也就在不断的发生着变化。但在整风反右和教育革命以前，这种变化还是不显著的，这是因为在这以前，学校的政治思想面貌还没有发生根本性的变化。在整风反右以后，特别是在教育革命以后，党对高等学校的领导进一步巩固加强了，党的群众路线从群众运动中进一步发展了，革命引起了各方面的深刻变化，师生关系也就有了显著的改变。而改变的程度和师生政治思想上的进步程度成正比例。革命把人们的感情联系起来，师生的结合既不再是虚构的伦常关系的结合，也不再是商品交换关系的结合，而是血肉相连，相敬相爱，这是只有在社会主义时代里才能产生的一种伟大的纯真的爱。
    我们所以说它伟大，因为彼此相爱的出发点是宏伟的社会主义建设事业。彼此都以尽快地成为共产主义新人相要求；我们所以说它纯真，因为这是一种崭新的平等的同志关系，彼此在真理面前一律平等，在错误面前也一律平等，凡是真理不论先生学生都要坚持，都要服从，凡是错误也不论先生学生都要改正，都要批评，这是真正同志的关怀，同志的爱；教师看到学生的缺点严正的提出，是热望学生尽快地成为共产主义新人，学生看到教师的缺点诚恳地指出，也是热望教师成为全面的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。有了这种相互关怀，教学还能不相长吗？这种亲密关系可以加强巩固教师在教学中的主导作用，教师在教学中的创造性可以得到进一步的发挥，真正担负起“传道、授业、解惑”的责任，对学生学习中的困难就会主动的去考虑，对学生提出来的疑难问题，也会乐于和学生共同研究解决，对学生某些点上超过自己的见解也就会觉得高兴，对学生提出的一些批评和意见，也就会从求得帮助的立场上去考虑；学生也就会因此而更热爱教师，更尊敬老师，认真地去学习老师之所长，彼此毫无戒心，以诚相见，为探讨真理而自由争辩。
    古人称颂老师，往往爱用“如坐春风，如沾时雨”一类的字句。在我们看来，只有在今天，党的光芒照耀和师生之间的纯真的同志爱，才是真正的春风和时雨！
