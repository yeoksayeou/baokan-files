Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 18th: More than 4,000 teachers and students from Wuhan Medical College and Hubei Medical College, after going to the countryside and living, eating, and working with the farmers, carried out pest and disease elimination work, achieving great success in teaching, scientific research, and political ideology.

These two medical colleges, according to the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, organized teachers and students to go to the countryside at the end of November last year. In several months of rural work, the teachers and students, based on the principles of universal examination and key treatment, examined farmers eight million nine hundred thousand times and carried out some treatment work; combined with accumulating fertilizer and eliminating the "Seven Pests", they helped farmers rectify canteens, toilets, and environmental sanitation. In addition, they trained more than 60,000 health workers for various places.

When working in the countryside, the teachers and students adopted methods such as concentrated training and decentralized treatment, seeing patients during the day and discussing at night, as well as surgical demonstrations and clinical lectures, learning while doing, and researching while learning. Teachers and students from Hubei Medical College conducted thousands of on-site teaching sessions during their work in the countryside. Teachers and students from both colleges also widely carried out mass scientific research by comparing treatment plans, identifying drug efficacy, and summarizing the masses' experiences in eliminating the "Four Pests" and promoting hygiene, writing more than 1,000 scientific papers and special reports, many of which have scientific value. For example, the Zaoyang work team of Wuhan Medical College used the method of cupping with bamboo jars to treat advanced filariasis, which not only reduced the patient's pain but also greatly improved the curative effect.

Through learning and researching while working in practical work, the students' professional knowledge has significantly improved. First-year students who had only been in school for a few months can now generally master the prevention and treatment techniques for several common diseases; senior students can generally independently handle outpatient clinics and more demanding treatment work.

### 给农民除疾病　给自己添知识  武汉医学院和湖北医学院师生下乡除害灭病

    给农民除疾病　给自己添知识
    武汉医学院和湖北医学院师生下乡除害灭病
    新华社武汉18日电　武汉医学院和湖北医学院四千多名师生经过下放农村和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，开展除害灭病工作，在教学、科学研究、政治思想等方面都获得了丰收。
    这两所医学院是根据中共湖北省委的指示，在去年11月底组织师生下乡的。在几个月的农村工作中，师生们根据普遍检查和重点治疗原则，给农民作了八百九十多万人次的检查和进行了一部分治疗工作；结合积肥、消灭七害，帮助农民整顿食堂、厕所和环境卫生。此外，他们为各地培养六万多名卫生人员。
    师生们在农村工作时，采取集中练兵分散治疗，白天看病夜间讨论，以及手术示范临床讲课等方法，边作、边学、边研究。湖北医学院师生在农村工作时，曾进行了上千次的现场教学。两所学院的师生还通过比较治疗方案、鉴定药物疗效、总结群众除四害讲卫生的经验等方式，广泛地开展群众性的科学研究，写出科学论文、专题报告一千多篇，其中不少论文具有科学价值。如武汉医学院枣阳工作队采用拔竹罐的方法治疗晚期丝虫病，不但减轻了病人的痛苦，疗效也大大提高。
    经过在工作实践中边作边学边研究，学生们的业务知识显著提高，刚入校几个月的一年级学生现在一般都能掌握几种常见病的防治技术；高年级学生一般都能单独担任门诊和较繁重的治疗工作。
