In February, we traveled south from Chengdu to Yibin. Although the journey was less than a thousand *li*, it felt like we had passed through several seasons. Along the way, we saw intense preparations for spring plowing. Here, in the neatly leveled rice paddies, the rice seedlings were a lush green. On both banks of the Yangtze River, vigorous wheat seedlings and blooming rapeseed, field after field, with their dark green leaves contrasting with the pale yellow flowers, resembled an embroidered silk carpet stretching towards the distant hills.

Yibin is a hilly area in southern Sichuan, where the Minjiang and Jinsha Rivers converge. The spring plowing in the Sichuan Basin always begins here first. Although farmers everywhere started spring plowing earlier this year, Yibin is still ahead, and the preparations for spring plowing are especially meticulous.

The climate here is warm, and the seasons arrive early, which is a natural advantage! However, the people's enthusiasm for production is an even more important factor. As early as last autumn and winter, the farmers were busy preparing for this spring. Longxi Commune in Pingshan County, on the banks of the Jinsha River, is a mountainous area more than 1,200 meters above sea level. Around the Spring Festival, it even snowed there. The oxen were reluctant to go into the fields because of the cold. To seize the season for a good harvest, Luo Xianguang, a committee member of the Fanshen Gengzuo District, took the lead in going into the fields to plow and harrow with a few young men. At lunchtime, others noticed blood on Luo Xianguang's leg. Upon closer inspection, it was found that he had been cut by the plowshare. He wiped away the blood and went back to the fields in the afternoon.

One late night in late February, a sudden wind and rain caused the temperature to drop, and the sown rice seeds were in danger of being damaged by frost. The commune members of the Lijia Commune in Yibin County immediately put on their clothes and got out of bed. Some moved thatch to cover the rice seedling beds, while others lit fires on the edges of the fields to create smoke. In an instant, piles of bonfires were burning everywhere in the fields, and people braved the wind and rain to guard the seedlings all night. The rice seedlings finally overcame the invasion of the cold air.

On the hillsides, aerial cableways whirred, and manure baskets and earth baskets flew up and down like the wind. The old field ridges were widened and leveled, and some were laid with wooden rails, with架架车 and wheelbarrows moving back and forth. In order to seize the season, people not only put in more effort but also used twice the skill. Thanks to the ideas contributed by the farmers throughout the county, the efficiency of spring plowing preparations was increased by one or two times.

Here, commune members told us many stories, all woven from warm hearts. Zhang Huaqing and Song Yuzhen, members of the Fuming Commune on the banks of the Yangtze River, are a harmonious old couple; however, they recently had a dispute. It turned out that Song Yuzhen and her husband had accumulated 40,000 to 50,000 *jin* of good fertilizer since last winter and planned to plant one or two *mu* of high-yield experimental fields this year to launch a big "satellite." However, the commune established a "satellite" battalion before the New Year, and Zhang Huaqing was to serve as the technical instructor for the demonstration fields. Zhang Huaqing planned to transport most of the fine fertilizer accumulated at home to the demonstration fields. However, Song Yuzhen was also working on high-yield fields in the women's high-yield team. She believed that the fertilizer was mainly accumulated by herself and should not be all transported away by her husband. If it was to be divided, then it should be half for each of them. So, the couple started arguing. In the end, the masses stepped in and rationally distributed the fertilizer, which resolved the problem. From then on, Zhang Huaqing and Song Yuzhen launched a fertilizer accumulation competition. Before long, large piles of fertilizer were accumulated in both of their fields.

Guo Yincheng, the Party Secretary of Songjia Commune in Nanxi County, started working in the fields at the age of twelve, and he is most familiar with the thoughts of the farmers. This spring, he set a goal of achieving 10,000 *jin* per *mu* on a large area. There were many nights when he tossed and turned in bed, worried about achieving such a high goal this year. However, the commune members gave him thousands of ideas, which boosted his enthusiasm. In particular, he personally witnessed father-son challenges and husband-wife competitions, with everyone presenting letters of determination and guarantees, wanting to contribute more to this year's greater leap forward, which strengthened his confidence even more. He said, "With such masses, I dare to break into even a dragon's pool or a tiger's den!"

    宜宾人民心肠热
    本报记者　王焕斗　周祖佑
    2月，我们从成都南行到了宜宾，虽然不到一千里的路程，却好似过了几个节令。一路上，我们看到了紧张的备耕活动。在这里，平整的秧田里，稻苗一片嫩绿；长江两岸一丘连一丘的茁壮的麦苗和盛花的油菜，墨绿衬着鹅黄，像锦绣的丝毯，直铺向遥远的山岗。
    宜宾是四川南部的丘陵区，岷江和金沙江在这里会合。四川盆地的春耕，也总是先从这里开始。今年虽然各地农民都提前春耕，但是这里仍然领先，而且春耕准备工作特别细致。
    这里气候温暖，节令来得早，可谓得天独厚！但是人们搞生产的热心肠，却是更为重要的条件。早在去年秋冬，农民们就为今年的春天忙碌着。金沙江边的屏山县龙溪公社，是个拔海一千二百公尺以上的山区。春节前后，那里还飘了雪花。牛下田，也嫌冷，为了丰收抢季节，翻身耕作区区队委员罗显光首先带领着几个小伙子下田犁耙。中午吃饭时，别人发见罗显光腿上有血，仔细一看，是被铧犁划破了。他抹去了血迹，下午又下田了。
    2月下旬的一天深夜，骤风猛雨，气温下降，播下的稻种眼看要遭受冻害。宜宾县李家公社的社员们立刻披衣下床，有的搬茅草盖谷秧田，有的在田边点火熏烟，霎时间，田野里到处烧起一堆堆烟火，人们冒着风雨，整整守护了一夜。秧苗终于战胜了冷空气的侵袭。
    山坡上，架空索道刷刷地响着，粪筐、土筐飞似地上上下下；旧日的田埂加宽了，平整了，有的铺设着木轨，往来着架架车、独轮车。为了抓住节令，人们不仅劲上加劲，还运用了双倍的技巧。由于全县农民献计献策，使备耕工作的效率提高了一、两倍。
    在这里，社员们曾经给我们叙述了许多故事，这些故事都是由一颗颗火热的心编织起来的。长江岸边阜鸣公社社员张华清和宋玉珍，是对和睦的老夫妻；可是，最近突然发生了争执。原来宋玉珍和丈夫从去年冬天就积下了四五万斤好肥料，计划在今年种一两亩高产试验田，放个大“卫星”。但是社里在年前成立了个“卫星”营，要张华清担任示范田的技术指导员，张华清打算把家里积的精肥弄一大半运到示范田里去。但是宋玉珍在妇女高产队里也搞了丰产田，她认为肥料主要是自己积下的，不能让丈夫都运走，要分的话，就一人一半。于是，两口子争吵起来。最后，群众出面，合理分配这堆肥料，才算解决了问题。从那以后张华清和宋玉珍就展开了积肥竞赛，不多久，两口子的田里都积起了大堆的肥料。
    南溪县宋家公社党委书记郭银成，十二岁就下田干活，他对农民的心思最熟悉。今年春天，他就定下了大面积亩产万斤粮的目标。曾经有多少夜晚，他在床上翻来复去，为实现今年这样高的目标感到耽心。但是，社员们给他出了上千条主意，使他鼓足了干劲。特别是他亲眼看见父子挑战、夫妻竞赛，人人呈献决心书、保证书，要为今年更大跃进多出点力气，使他更加坚定了信心。他说：“有了这样的群众，龙潭虎穴我也敢闯啊！”
