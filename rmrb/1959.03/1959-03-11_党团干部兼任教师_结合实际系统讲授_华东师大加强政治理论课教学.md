Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 10th: East China Normal University in Shanghai is strengthening the teaching of political theory this semester by having Party and Communist Youth League cadres serve concurrently as political instructors, and by implementing a method that emphasizes both systematic theoretical lectures and current affairs and task education. This approach has been widely welcomed by students, and the atmosphere of studying political theory is unprecedentedly strong throughout the school.

This semester, East China Normal University is offering three political theory courses: "Socialist and Communist Education," "Political Economics," and "Philosophy." In addition, it stipulates that three hours per week be devoted to current affairs and task education for all students. The teaching time for the three political theory courses is uniformly stipulated as six hours per week, with three hours for lectures and three hours for self-study and discussion. First- and second-year students study Socialist and Communist Education, third-year students study Political Economics, and fourth-year students study Philosophy. In terms of teaching staff, the university has changed the previous situation where all courses were taught by full-time political teachers and political teachers did not manage the political and ideological work of students. Some political teachers have been assigned to departments, and all political teachers are encouraged to concurrently serve in Party and League work in some departments to better connect political teaching with reality and improve teaching quality. At the same time, the school's main political work cadres, such as the Party Committee Secretary and members, the Party Branch Secretaries of various departments and some members, and the main responsible cadres of the school's Communist Youth League organizations, have taken on the role of political teachers. The school also plans to invite, in a planned manner, responsible persons from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and district committees, as well as experienced veteran workers and peasants, to participate in the school's political lectures. All the school's political teachers form the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office, led by the Party Committee Secretary as the director of the Teaching and Research Office, and under the leadership of the Party Committee, are uniformly responsible for the teaching of political theory courses and the political and ideological education of students throughout the school.

This semester, Party and League cadres who serve concurrently as political instructors mainly lecture on Socialist and Communist Education, systematically explaining several theoretical issues in China's socialist construction. The new teaching plan stipulates that every Tuesday and Thursday evening is the collective lesson preparation time for political teachers in the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office, with the Party Committee Secretary presiding over the lesson preparation discussion meeting. The collective lesson preparation meeting mainly discusses the teaching focus, requirements, some theoretical issues, and analyzes the main ideological tendencies among students. Through such lesson preparation discussions, the teaching content has both theoretical exposition and does not deviate from current reality, which can greatly improve teaching quality. For example, the first unit of the Socialist and Communist Education course (studying the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee), the section on the domestic and international situation and our tasks, is lectured by Deputy Party Secretary Chen Zhunti. Based on the understanding of the domestic and international situation among the school's students, he cited a large number of facts to illustrate the principle that "the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day," guiding students to use the correct standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze the domestic and international situation. Students generally reported that after listening to the lecture, they were able to string together many vague and fragmented phenomena from reading newspapers, the logic became clear, and they had a basic understanding of the domestic and international situation. To enhance the learning effect, the school also adopted a method for certain parts of the political course where teachers give an initial report to stimulate thought, students study and discuss on their own, and finally the teachers give a systematic lecture and summarize based on the discussion. Students were very enthusiastic in their discussions.

Since the implementation of the new teaching methods for political courses this semester, teachers and students alike believe that the effect is very good. Students feel that they have not only learned theory but also solved practical ideological problems, and they understand how to apply theory to understand and analyze reality. Therefore, the atmosphere of learning is unprecedentedly strong. Many students have listed studying political theory well as the first item in their red and expert plans.

    党团干部兼任教师　结合实际系统讲授
    华东师大加强政治理论课教学
    新华社上海10日电　上海华东师范大学这学期采取由党和共青团的干部兼任政治课教师，课程内容实行系统理论讲授和当前形势与任务教育并重的办法，加强政治理论课的教学，受到学生的普遍欢迎，全校学生学习政治理论的空气空前浓厚。
    华东师大这学期共开设“社会主义与共产主义教育”、“政治经济学”和“哲学”等三门政治理论课，另外规定每周有三小时对全校学生进行形势与任务教育。三门政治理论课的教学时间全校统一规定为每周六小时，其中三小时上课，三小时自学和讨论。一、二年级学生学习社会主义与共产主义教育，三年级学生学政治经济学，四年级学生学哲学。师资方面，改变了过去全部由专职政治教师任教和政治教师不管学生政治思想工作的情况，将部分政治教师下放到系，所有政治教师尽可能兼任一部分系的党和团的工作，使政治课教学更好地联系实际，以提高教学质量。同时，校内主要政治工作干部，如党委书记和委员、各系的党总支书记和部分委员，以及学校共青团组织的主要负责干部，兼任了政治课教师。学校还准备有计划地聘请中共上海市委和区委的负责人，以及富有斗争经验的老工人、老农民参加学校政治课的讲授。全校政治教师共同组成马列主义教研室，由党委书记任教研室主任，在党委领导下，统一负责全校政治理论课的教学和学生政治思想教育工作。
    本学期兼任政治教师的党和团的干部，主要是分别讲授社会主义与共产主义教育课，系统讲述我国社会主义建设中的若干理论问题。新教学计划规定每周星期二和星期四的晚上，是马列主义教研室政治教师集体备课时间，由党委书记主持召开备课讨论会。集体备课会主要是讨论讲授重点、要求，以及一些理论性问题和分析学生中的主要思想倾向。通过这样的备课讨论，教学内容既有理论的阐述，又不脱离当前实际，可以大大提高教学质量。例如社会主义与共产主义教育课第一单元（学习六中全会决议）中国内外形势和我们的任务部分，是由党委副书记陈准堤主讲。他根据全校学生对国内外形势的认识，引用大量事实说明“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的道理，指导学生用正确的立场、观点、方法分析国内外形势。学生们普遍反映，听课后把平日读报中许多模糊零碎的现象串连起来，条理清楚了，对国内外形势有了基本的了解。为了增强学习效果，学校还对政治课程的某些部分采取先由教师作启发报告，学生自学、讨论，最后再由教师结合讨论情况进行系统讲授并作总结的方法。学生们在讨论中情绪十分热烈。
    这学期政治课实行新的教学方法以来，师生一致认为效果很好。学生们感到既学到了理论，又解决了实际思想问题，懂得运用理论去认识和分析实际。因而学习空气空前浓厚。很多学生把学好政治理论列为自己红专规划的第一条。
