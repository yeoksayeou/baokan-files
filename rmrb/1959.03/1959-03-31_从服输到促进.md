Many people with conservative ideas had already bowed their heads in defeat during the Great Leap Forward last year. In the new year, they are even more determined to whip their horses and catch up, joining the ranks of the promoters of progress. Many examples I heard in Chengguan People's Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, profoundly reflect this important characteristic of our great era.

"False Zhuge Liang" Becomes "Better Than Zhuge Liang"

The middle peasant Wang Guangfa has been farming for half his life, and he is skilled at everything, whether it's hoeing, plowing, harrowing, or rolling. In the village, he considered himself a capable person. Because of this, in the past, when the commune used chemical powder to control insects, he said, "Even the Dragon King's urine doesn't touch it, what good is that white powder?" When the commune carried out dense planting, he said, "They're deliberately squeezing the seedlings to death!" He wholeheartedly supported cooperativization and communization because it brought him a happy life. However, when people talked about promoting new farming methods and technologies, he always had his own opinions: the first year it was because of "favorable weather," and the second year it was still "favorable weather." Gradually, the villagers gave him the nickname "False Zhuge Liang."

Last year, he was also a little eager to try during the Great Leap Forward. After the Party branch discovered this, they immediately encouraged him to plant 1.4 mu of high-yield corn experimental field. However, as soon as he took the first step, he was tripped up by old experiences. Others deep-plowed, he shallow-plowed; others densely planted, he secretly left behind more than half of the seeds. The seedlings showed the difference as soon as they emerged from the soil: others' were dense and strong, his were sparse and weak. He was flustered inside, but he couldn't bring himself to ask others for advice. The Party branch promptly mobilized some young commune members to help him replant seedlings, apply fertilizer, and water; when the corn tasseled, they half-persuaded and half-forced him to carry out artificial pollination. In this way, he harvested more than 1,600 jin of corn per mu last year. This yield was something Wang Guangfa had never dared to dream of in the past.

Facts educated Wang Guangfa. This year, next to his mu of wheat seedlings, which are green and strong, stands a tall wooden sign, which reads: Deep plow three feet, apply 600,000 jin of base fertilizer… resolutely implement the Eight-Character Charter, and strive to create a high-yield record. The six characters "Farmer Wang Guangfa" are written in red and are particularly conspicuous. Day and night, in wind and rain, he was simply absorbed by the ever-changing wheat seedlings. He said: "Now we dare to think and dare to do, we will definitely be able to pick the fairy fruit!"

The commune members excitedly spread the news: "False Zhuge Liang" is really going to become "Better Than Zhuge Liang" this year.

Old Farmer Catches Up with Young People

In the wave of everyone learning from and catching up with the advanced last year, a surprising large wooden sign appeared in a cotton field here: "My experience is inexhaustible, I don't need others to teach me, high cotton yield must be achieved!" Look, "What a big tone!"

This seventy-year-old man is Li Jinfang.

Old man Li Jinfang has been competitive all his life. If someone says something good about him, he immediately brews tea and prepares wine to treat them warmly; if someone says he is not good, he immediately makes you unable to step down. Although this is the case, when the old man really sees the strengths of others, he is also sincere in admiration. Last summer, he suffered continuous moldy rain, and his cotton bolls rotted and fell. Someone advised him to go to the neighboring village to see how others were managing their cotton, and the old man exploded: "The heavens are blind, where is it different. The few mu of cotton I grew in the 18th year of the Republic of China were the best in Weinan County." The villagers kept praising Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton in the neighboring village for being well-managed. He couldn't help but be a little moved. Taking the opportunity, he went to Qiuxiang's field alone. "Hey, what good and dense cotton bolls!" The old man couldn't help but stroke his beard and praised: "If everyone managed cotton like this, our country's cotton would still be usable!"

After seeing Qiuxiang's cotton, the old man was convinced. This year, he asked the team for five more mu of cotton land. Although others advised him not to grow cotton, he wouldn't listen no matter what. However, his old temper has also changed a bit, "My old experience will learn some new experiences from young people, and this year I still want to compete with them!" He drew several pictures himself and hung them at home. Each picture shows a person riding a blue dragon, flying through the wind, and neatly writing four characters on the picture: "Strive for the Upstream"!

No Longer Disparaging Women

Women are a rising force in the Great Leap Forward. Liu Juncai's husband, Bai Hencai, did not believe this until recently. Last year, Liu Juncai worked in the Xue Junxiu women's cotton planting team. They guaranteed a yield of 3,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, determined to catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang, a national cotton planting expert. Bai Hencai didn't believe that the frightening target could be achieved, let alone that his wife and the women in the village could accomplish anything. From sowing to harvesting, he didn't ask a single question. Once, Liu Juncai was in the team working hard to replant seedlings overnight, and didn't make him dinner. He flared up, walked to the entrance of the village and shouted towards the fields, "It's really haunted, the women in our village want to be immortals, let's see if they can manage the cotton into immortal flowers?" In the autumn, the Xue Junxiu cotton planting team harvested an average of more than 3,100 jin of seed cotton per mu, really catching up with Zhang Qiuxiang all at once. When someone mentioned that matter from last year to Bai Hencai again, his face turned red to the base of his neck.

This year, you can often hear Bai Hencai shouting with a loudspeaker: "Women, villagers, go to the fields, the high-yield fields are waiting for watering!" He is now the production team leader, in charge of about two hundred people, and when he speaks, he often puts women first.

    从服输到促进
    新华社记者　袁木
    许多有保守思想的人，在去年的大跃进中已低头服输。他们在新的一年中更决心快马加鞭，迎头赶上，加入到促进派的行列。我在陕西省渭南县城关人民公社听到的许多事例，都深刻地体现了我们伟大时代的这个重要特征。
    “假诸葛”成了“赛诸葛”
    中农王光法种了半辈子庄稼，不论锄、犁、耙、耱，样样都是一把好手。在村里，他自认为是“一个指头剥葱”的能人。就因为这个，往年社里用化学药粉治虫，他说“龙王尿都不沾，上那白面面管啥”；社里搞密植，他说“成心把苗挤死”；……他从心底拥护合作化和公社化，因为这给他带来了幸福生活。可是，人们谈到推广新耕作方法和新技术时，他总另有自己的看法：头年是因为“风调雨顺”，二年还是“风调雨顺”。慢慢的，村里人给他送了个“假诸葛”的绰号。
    去年，他在大跃进中也有点跃跃欲试，党支部发现后，立刻鼓励他种了一亩四分玉米高产试验田。可是，他刚跨出第一步，又被老经验绊住了脚。别人深翻，他浅翻；别人密植，他暗暗留下一多半籽种。苗子出土就见了高低：别人的又稠又壮，他的又稀又瘦。他内心慌乱，又抹不下脸去请教别人。党支部及时发动一些青年社员帮他补苗、上粪、浇水；玉米抽穗时，又半说服半勉强地帮他搞了人工授粉。就这样，他去年一亩玉米收了一千六百多斤。这产量是王光法过去做梦也不敢想的。
    事实教育了王光法。今年，在他那麦苗碧绿茁壮的一亩丰产地旁，竖起了一块又高又大的木牌，上面写道：深翻三尺，施底肥六十万斤，……坚决贯彻八字宪法，力争创造高产纪录。“作务人王光法”六个大字是用红笔写的，特别显眼。他没明没夜，风里雨里，简直被那一天一变的麦苗儿吸住了。他说：“咱现在敢想敢干，咱就一定能把仙果子摘下来！”
    社员们兴奋地竞相传告：“假诸葛”今年真的要成为“赛诸葛”了。
    老农赶青年
    在去年那人人学先进赶先进的浪潮中，这里的一块棉田里，却出现了一块令人惊讶的大木牌：“我的经验用不清，不用别人把我教，棉花高产要实现！”瞧，“这是多大的口气！”
      这位七十多岁的老汉就是李金芳。
    李金芳老汉一辈子要强好胜，谁说他个好，他马上泡茶打酒，热情款待；要说他不行，他当下叫你下不来台。虽说这样，老汉真的见到别人的长处，佩服起来也是实心实意。去夏遭了连霉雨，他的棉桃沤的沤了，落的落了。有人劝他到邻村看看别人的棉花是咋个作务的，老汉一下子炸了：“老天不睁眼，哪里不一样。咱民国十八年务的几亩花，全渭南县数一。”村里人一个劲儿称赞邻村张秋香的棉花务的好，他心里也不免有些活动，瞅个机会，一个人悄悄去到秋香的地里。“嗨，多好多密的棉桃啊！”老汉不由得捻着胡须赞扬开了：“要是人人都把棉花务成这个样，咱国家的棉花还能用得清！”
    看过秋香的棉花，老汉服啦。他今年又向队里要了五亩棉花地。虽然别人劝他不要种花，他怎么也不听。不过，他的老脾气也有些变了，“咱这老经验再学些年青人的新经验，今年还要同他们见个高低！”他自己画了几张画挂在家里，张张都是一个人驾青龙乘风飞驰，画上工整地写着四个大字：“力争上游”！
    再不轻视妇女了
    妇女是大跃进中突起的异军。刘俊彩的丈夫白恒才，不久前并不相信这一点。去年刘俊彩在薛俊秀妇女植棉组里务花，她们保证亩产籽棉三千斤，决心赶上全国植棉能手张秋香。白恒才不相信那吓人的指标能实现，更不相信自己的老婆和村里那伙妇女能成个啥事。从下种到收花，他压根儿没有问过一句。有一次，刘俊彩在组里连夜突击补苗，没给他做下晚饭，他就发作开了，走到村口冲着地里嚷道：“真见了鬼啦，咱村的妇女想当仙人哩，看他们能把个棉花务成仙花？”秋后，薛俊秀植棉组平均一亩地收了三千一百多斤籽花，真的一下子赶上了张秋香。有人再向白恒才提起去年那档子事，他的脸一下子就红到脖子根。
    今年，常常可以听到白恒才拿着个喇叭筒在叫喊：“妇女们，乡亲们，下地啦，丰产地里等着浇水哩！”他今年当了生产小队长，管着二百来口人，说起话来常常都把妇女放在头里。
