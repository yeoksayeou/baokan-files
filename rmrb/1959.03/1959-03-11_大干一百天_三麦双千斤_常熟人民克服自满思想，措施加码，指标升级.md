Changshu, March 6th. This newspaper reports that Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, held on-the-spot meetings from top to bottom, effectively overcoming and preventing the complacency and paralysis that had begun to emerge among cadres and the masses. The county party committee also put forward the ambitious slogan: "A hundred days of great effort, 1,000 jin per mu for three wheat crops, one harvest equals a year, the key lies in the present."

Changshu County's 770,000 mu of three wheat crops have dense and strong seedlings, surpassing any previous year. The broad masses of cadres and people are full of confidence in achieving the 1,000 jin target. However, a kind of complacency and paralysis began to grow among some cadres and people, satisfied with the original production increase targets and the various measures already implemented, and failing to recognize the greater potential for increasing the production of three wheat crops. At the beginning of the topdressing sprint week, some communes acted slowly. Production team leaders believed that three applications of winter fertilizer had already been applied last year, and now that the seedlings were growing so vigorously, there was no need to apply more topdressing.

The Changshu County Party Committee believes that this complacency and paralysis is an important obstacle to achieving high yields of three wheat crops at present and must be corrected in a timely manner. The county party committee immediately adopted the method of promoting progress by observing the seedlings and held an on-the-spot meeting in Tangqiao Commune. At present, the wheat seedlings in this commune generally grow densely and strongly, with each seedling generally having two to four tillers, seventy to one million two hundred thousand seedlings per mu, and have begun to joint. The party committee secretaries of various communes were greatly inspired after visiting the wheat seedlings and the enthusiasm of the masses in Tangqiao Commune.

Everyone did some careful accounting based on last year's experience and the local wheat seedling conditions. Although the county's wheat seedlings suffered from severe scab last year, the better wheat still had thirty-six to thirty-eight grains per ear. This year's wheat seedling base is much better than last year. If we seize the later processing without giving an inch, it is entirely possible to increase the number of grains. Now the county averages seven to eight hundred thousand mu per mu, and strives to have ears on every seedling and forty grains per ear. Counting 16,000 grains per jin, we can harvest 2,000 jin.

The county held a broadcast conference attended and listened to by more than 300,000 people in late February. Tangqiao Commune challenged all communes in the county to a competition for a mu yield of 3,000 jin of three wheat crops. The communes responded one after another, vowing to compete with Tangqiao. Subsequently, the communes and brigades also held on-the-spot meetings to promote progress by observing the seedlings, re-revise the original production increase targets, and intensify measures.

After the new targets were proposed, the commune members were even more motivated, and crowds of people applying fertilizer and accumulating fertilizer were all over the fields. A total of 230,000 people in the county (accounting for 70% of the agricultural labor force) participated in the sprint to vigorously apply spring fertilizer. At the same time, experienced farmers were organized to conduct large-scale field inspections, determine seedlings by plot, analyze seedling conditions, conduct research by category, insert flags according to seedlings, and apply fertilizer according to flags.

### 大干一百天　三麦双千斤  常熟人民克服自满思想，措施加码，指标升级

    大干一百天　三麦双千斤
    常熟人民克服自满思想，措施加码，指标升级
    本报常熟6日电　江苏常熟县从上到下召开现场会，有效地克服并防止了干部和群众中开始露头的自满麻痹思想。县委还提出“大干一百天，三麦收双千，一熟顶一年，关键在当前”的豪迈口号。
    常熟全县七十七万亩三麦，苗密、苗壮，超过以往任何一年。广大干部和群众对实现千斤指标充满信心。但是在部分干部和群众中也开始滋长了一种自满麻痹情绪，满足于原定的增产指标和已经实现的各项措施，对三麦更大的增产潜力认识不足。在追肥突击周开始时，有些公社行动迟缓。生产小队长认为去年已经施过三次腊肥，现在苗长得这样旺盛，用不着再施追肥。
    中共常熟县委认为这种自满麻痹思想，是当前争取三麦高产的重要障碍，必须及时纠正。县委立即采取看苗促进的办法，在塘桥公社召开现场会议。目前这个公社的麦苗普遍长得密，长得壮，每支苗一般已分蘖二到四株，每亩苗数七十到一百二十万，并已开始拔节。各公社的党委书记参观了塘桥公社的麦苗和群众干劲后，受到很大启发。
    大家根据去年经验和当地麦苗情况算了一笔细账。去年全县麦苗虽遭受严重的赤霉病，但较好的麦每穗仍有三十六到三十八粒，今年麦苗基础比去年好得多，如果一步不让地抓紧后期加工，增加粒数完全可能。现在全县平均每亩七八十万亩，力争苗苗有穗，穗穗四十粒，按一万六千粒一斤计，就可收到两千斤。
    全县在2月下旬召开了有三十多万人参加收听的广播大会，塘桥公社向全县各个公社摆下了争取三麦亩产三千斤的竞赛擂台，各公社纷纷应战，誓与塘桥比高低。接着，各公社、各大队也分别召开现场会议看苗促进，重新修订了原来的增产指标，措施也重新加码。
    新的指标提出以后，各公社社员干劲更足，追肥积肥的人群遍布田野。全县共有二十三万人（占农业生产劳动力70％），投入了猛追春肥的突击运动。同时，组织老农进行田头大检查，逐丘定苗，分析苗情，逐类进行研究，按苗插旗，按旗追肥。
