Firmly Grasp the Initiative
    Chen Zhiyan

    We are at war with the Earth. Nature, this enemy, is extremely tenacious. Without considerable strength, it will not be tamed to serve you. And our foundation is called "poor and blank," the old ruling class left us with economic and cultural disadvantages. Our task of socialist construction is to turn disadvantages into advantages and build our country into a modern, prosperous, and strong socialist power. Under the correct leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, after the construction of our first Five-Year Plan, especially the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the original "poor and blank" situation has undergone great changes.

    We are fighting to thoroughly change this situation as quickly as possible.

    In this struggle, it is very important to base all actions on the initiative.

    From a military point of view, whichever side of the enemy has the initiative is closer to victory; whoever is in a passive position may fail. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his two documents, "Strategic Problems of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare" and "On Protracted War," put forward the strategic guiding ideology of striving for the initiative and turning passivity into initiative, "...first use one's own local advantages and initiative to attack the enemy's local disadvantages and passivity, win in one battle, then deal with the rest, defeat them one by one, and the overall situation will thus turn into an advantage, turn into initiative."

    Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical analysis fully embodies the genius strategic thinking of turning passivity into initiative in a situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak.

    War and construction are two different categories, and the issues they involve are naturally different. However, there is one thing in common, that is, in socialist construction, we must also "base all actions on the initiative," as Comrade Mao Zedong said in his argument on military struggle.

    Because of "poor and blank," we have a lot of things to do, indeed, everything is waiting to be done, the battle line is long, and everything must be done, and one thing is indispensable. The question is how to do it. One way is to use strength evenly and dispersedly, because from the perspective of needs, everything is important, so everyone "mounts their horses" and advances in a straight line. However, because the strength is not concentrated, it is difficult to form local advantages and initiative, and as a result, the development speed is very slow, and the problem cannot be fundamentally solved quickly. One way is to concentrate strength, prioritize what is important, prioritize what is urgent, create advantages in important departments, win in one battle, drive the overall situation, and achieve high-speed development of the entire national economy. Which method is more proactive? Of course, it is the latter.

    Why must we take steel as the key link? Because with steel, everything is possible. Concentrating strength, ensuring the advantage of steel, ensuring the production of raw materials such as steel, iron, coal, and steel, can win in one battle and bring about a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the entire industry, putting us in an active position.

    Why must we first ensure the six major mechanical products of mining, steel rolling, coal washing and coking, irrigation and drainage, power stations, and locomotives and vehicles in the machinery industry this year? Because this is an important measure to ensure the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and to concentrate strength to create the advantages of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. If we have 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 105 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton, we will be much more proactive. Not only will we be firmly in control of the initiative this year, but we will also create good conditions for the continuous high growth of the national economy in the future.

    From this, it can also be seen that the Party's principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" is entirely an active and positive principle. Concentrating the greatest and highest enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole country, twisting the strength of the whole Party and the whole people into one rope, and ensuring the timely and advanced realization of the four major indicators, the initiative will be firmly grasped, and the victory of the overall situation will be as easy as turning one's hand.

    The second quarter is approaching in the blink of an eye. This is a decisive quarter, and we must concentrate our efforts even more, continue our efforts, and show the greatest and highest enthusiasm to ensure the completion of the six major equipment on schedule and in complete sets, ensure the completion of steel, iron, coal, and steel plans on a daily and ten-day basis, and ensure the victorious realization of agricultural production plans. We often say "opportunities are not to be missed, and time never returns," which means that we must proactively seize opportunities, which is the way to win. If the plan for the second quarter is completed and overfulfilled, the third and fourth quarters will be proactive, and the victory of the whole year will be guaranteed. If the opportunity is lost, the initiative will also be lost. For example, if equipment for mining, coal washing, coking, and steel rolling is not seized in the second quarter and produced on time and in complete sets as soon as possible, then the whole year's production will be passive.

    Only by taking the initiative can we get rid of passivity. With the initiative, we can develop the national economy more flexibly and dynamically, just like a person with wings who can soar freely.

    稳操主动
    陈之衍
    我们是在向地球开战。自然这个敌人是十分顽强的，你没有相当的力量，它是不肯驯服地为你服务的。而我们的底子呢，叫做“一穷二白”，旧的统治阶级给我们留下的是经济、文化上的劣势。我们进行社会主义建设的任务，就是变劣势为优势，把我国建设成为一个现代化的繁荣昌盛的社会主义强国。在党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，我国经过第一个五年计划的建设，特别是1958年的大跃进，原来的“一穷二白”的局面已经有了很大的改变。
    我们正在为尽快地彻底改变这种局面而斗争。
    在这个斗争中，把一切行动立于主动地位这一条非常重要。
    从军事上说，敌对双方，谁掌握主动，谁就接近胜利；谁处于被动，谁就可能失败。毛泽东同志在“抗日游击战争的战略问题”和“论持久战”两篇文献中，曾经极其精辟地提出了力争主动和变被动为主动的战略指导思想，“……先以自己局部的优势和主动，向着敌人的局部的劣势和被动，一战而胜，再及其余，各个击破，全局因而转成了优势，转成了主动。”
    毛泽东同志这种辩证的分析，充分体现了在敌强我弱的形势下，变被动为主动的天才战略思想。
    战争和建设，是两个不同的范畴，它们所涉及的问题，自然是不同的。然而有一点相通之处，这就是在社会主义建设中，也要像毛泽东同志在论证军事斗争所说的“一切行动立于主动地位”。
    由于“一穷二白”，所以我们要办的事情非常多，确是百废待举，战线漫长，样样都得办，少一样也不行。问题在于怎样办。一种办法是平均分散使用力量，因为从需要上说，样样都是重要的，于是大家都“上马”，一字形的齐头并进。可是因为力量不集中，很难形成局部的优势和主动，结果发展速度很慢，不能迅速地从根本上解决问题。一种办法是集中力量，重其所重，急其所急，造成重要部门的优势，一战而胜，带动全盘，取得整个国民经济的高速度发展。是哪一种方法主动呢？当然是后者。
    为什么必须以钢为纲呢？因为有了钢，一切就有办法。集中力量，保证钢的优势，保证钢、铁、煤、钢材等原材料的生产，就能一战而胜及其余，形成整个工业的全面大跃进，使我们立于主动地位。
    为什么今年在机械工业中首先必须保证矿山、轧钢、洗煤炼焦、排灌、电站、机车车辆等六大机械产品呢？因为这是保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标实现的重要措施，是为了集中力量造成钢、煤、粮、棉的优势。我们有了一千八百万吨钢，三亿八千万吨煤，一万零五百亿斤粮食，一亿担棉花，我们就主动得多了。不仅今年稳操主动，而且也为今后国民经济不断高涨造成主动的良好条件。
    从这里也可看出，党的“全国一盘棋”的方针，完全是一个主动的积极的方针。集中全党、全国最大最高的积极性，把全党、全民的力量拧成一股绳、保证四大指标按时和提前实现，主动就稳操握中，全局的胜利就易如反掌了。
    第二季度转瞬即至，这是一个决定性的季度，必须更加集中力量，再接再厉，拿出最大最高的积极性，确保六大设备按期按套完成，确保钢、铁、煤、钢材按日按旬完成计划，确保农业生产计划胜利实现。我们常说“机不可失，时不再来”，意思就是要主动地抓住时机，这是致胜之道。第二季度的计划完成和超额完成了，第三、第四季度就主动了，全年的胜利就有把握了。时机丧失了，主动也就丧失了。例如矿山、洗煤、炼焦、轧钢等设备如果不抓紧第二季度，尽快地按期、按套地生产出来，那末，全年的生产就会处于被动。
    只有主动才能摆脱被动。主动了，才可以更机动灵活地来发展国民经济，就像人长了翅膀，可以自由翱翔。
