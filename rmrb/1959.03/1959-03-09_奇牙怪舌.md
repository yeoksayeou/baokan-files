    Peculiar Teeth and Strange Tongues
    Some animals have their teeth and tongues grown together. For example, the penguin is like this, with its entire tongue covered in sharp barbs (teeth). This is because it mainly survives by eating fish, and these sharp teeth can help it catch slippery fish food.
    In America, there is a common orchard snail that grows one hundred and thirty-five rows of teeth, with one hundred and five teeth in each row. When it wants to “bite through” underground burrows, it relies on these fourteen thousand one hundred and seventy-five teeth.
    Among animals, the longest tongue belongs to the anteater. Its head is like a long, extended elephant trunk, but even such a long "pouch" cannot contain its tongue, because its tongue does not grow in its mouth, nor in its throat, but grows on its sternum.

    奇牙怪舌
    有一些动物的牙齿和舌头长在一起，例如企鹅就是这样，整个舌头上长满了尖刺（牙齿），因为它主要靠吃鱼生存，而这些尖齿可以帮助它逮住溜滑的鱼食。
    在美洲有一种普通的果园蜗牛，它生长着一百三十五排牙齿，而且每排是一百零五个。当它要“咬穿”地下的穴道时，就要靠它这一万四千一百七十五个牙齿。
    动物中舌头最长的要算食蚁兽，它的头就像一个长长伸出的象鼻子，但是这样长的“袋子”也还装不下它的舌头，因为它的舌头不是生在嘴里，也不是在咽喉里，而是长在胸骨上。
