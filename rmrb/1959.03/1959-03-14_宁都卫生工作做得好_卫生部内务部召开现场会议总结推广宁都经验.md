Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 13th. The on-site meeting on eliminating pests and diseases held in Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, recently concluded. The meeting summarized the experiences of Ningdu and other places in eliminating pests and diseases, and studied and deployed the national tasks for eliminating pests and diseases in 1959.

This meeting was jointly presided over by the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The meeting was attended by the heads of health departments and bureaus of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as the heads of civil affairs departments of relevant provinces. Li Dequan, Minister of Public Health, He Biao, Deputy Minister, and Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, also attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting.

Since 1952, Ningdu County has continuously carried out the patriotic health movement, and the masses have gradually established a good habit of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene, which has effectively controlled and reduced the occurrence of various diseases, improved people's health, and promoted the development of production. In 1958, with the upsurge of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a large-scale movement to eliminate pests and diseases and promote hygiene was launched. Last December, another mass movement to eliminate seven pests (rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, cockroaches) and eradicate six diseases (venereal diseases, leprosy, tinea capitis, filariasis, hookworm disease, malaria) was organized throughout the county. In order to lead this movement well, from the county party committee to the grass-roots branches, the secretaries took the lead in establishing pest and disease elimination command posts, and closely integrated them with production. At that time, the biggest problem encountered in the movement was the lack of technical personnel, so they adopted the method of sending technical cadres to the lower levels, teaching, learning, and doing at the same time, and quickly trained more than 3,000 people with primary prevention and control skills among the masses; at the same time, they gave full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine. As a result, great achievements have been made in eliminating diseases and pests. During the six-day meeting, representatives from various places conducted on-site visits. In speeches at the general meeting and small meetings, they unanimously agreed that strengthening party leadership, putting politics in command, mobilizing the masses, making unified arrangements in combination with production, and combining Chinese and Western medicine, both indigenous and foreign methods, are the methods of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in Ningdu County's work on eliminating pests and diseases.

At this meeting, the general requirements for national health work in 1959 were adopted, and the national tasks for eliminating pests and diseases in 1959 were deployed. The meeting especially emphasized that in order to achieve the task of eliminating pests and diseases in 1959, it is necessary to closely cooperate with production, serve production, serve the central work, and actively do a good job in prevention and control. The meeting also emphasized that it is necessary to do a good job in the health work of the people's communes, further carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, and currently, it is especially necessary to do a good job in the prevention of spring infectious diseases.

    宁都卫生工作做得好
    卫生部内务部召开现场会议总结推广宁都经验
    新华社南昌13日电　在江西省宁都县召开的除害灭病现场会议最近闭幕。会议总结了宁都等地除害灭病的经验，研究和部署了1959年全国除害灭病的任务。
    这次会议由卫生部、内务部联合主持召开。参加这次会议的有全国各省市自治区卫生厅、局的负责人，及有关省的民政部门负责人。卫生部部长李德全、副部长贺彪，和中共江西省委书记方志纯等也参加了会议，并且在会上讲了话。
    宁都县从1952年起，就连年不断地开展爱国卫生运动，群众中逐渐树立起爱清洁、讲卫生的良好风气，有力地控制和减少了各种疾病的发生，增进了人民身体健康，促进了生产的发展。1958年，随着工农业生产大跃进的高潮，又开展了大规模的除害灭病、讲卫生运动。去年12月，又在全县范围内组织了一次除七害（老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤、臭虫、蟑螂）灭六病（性病、麻疯、头癣、丝虫、钩虫、疟疾）的群众运动。为了领导好这个运动，从县委到基层各个支部，由书记挂帅，普遍成立了除害灭病指挥部，并紧密结合生产进行。当时运动中碰到的最大问题是技术力量不足，他们就采取技术干部下放，边教、边学、边做的办法，在群众中迅速培养了具有初级防治技术人员三千多名；同时并充分发挥中医的作用。结果在灭病除害方面取得很大成就。在六天的会议中，各地代表进行了现场参观，在大会和小会发言中一致认为：加强党的领导，政治挂帅，发动群众，结合生产统一安排，中西医结合、土法和洋法并举等经验，是宁都县除害灭病工作中多快好省的方法。
    这次会议，通过1959年全国卫生工作总的要求，部署了1959年全国除害灭病的任务。会议特别强调指出，实现1959年除害灭病任务，必须密切配合生产，为生产服务为中心工作服务，积极地作好防治工作。会议还强调必须做好人民公社的卫生工作，进一步开展除四害、讲卫生运动，当前特别要做好春季传染病的预防工作。
