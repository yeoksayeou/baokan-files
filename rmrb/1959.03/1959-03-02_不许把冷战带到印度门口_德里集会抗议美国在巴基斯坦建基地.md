Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 2nd - Yesterday evening, the Indian people held a mass rally in Delhi, strongly protesting the United States' establishment of military bases in Pakistan and the impending US-Pakistan bilateral military agreement.

    Joachim Alva, a member of the Indian National Congress, said at the rally that India cannot remain silent on the United States' military aid to Pakistan, as it threatens India's freedom and security. He said that from the day US Vice President Nixon announced that the United States would ship weapons to Pakistan, it brought the Cold War to India's doorstep.

    Indian Communist Party member Bupehsi Gupta pointed out in his speech that the US military bases established in Pakistan threaten the independence and security of Asian and African countries, and are aimed at the democratic development and economic progress of the newly liberated Asian and African countries. Gupta said that the United States is attempting to divide the people of Asian and African countries through such policies, drag these countries into the Cold War, and prepare to attack them.

    Gupta condemned the United States for plotting to sign a bilateral military agreement with Pakistan, and pointed out that people should not trust the United States' hypocritical guarantees. He called on Asian and African countries to unite with socialist countries and cooperate to shatter the conspiracies of imperialist countries.

    Indian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Menon, also attended the rally.

    不许把冷战带到印度门口
    德里集会抗议美国在巴基斯坦建基地
    据新华社新德里电　2月28日傍晚，印度人民在德里举行群众集会，强烈抗议美国在巴基斯坦建立军事基地和美巴即将签订的双边军事协定。
    印度国大党议员乔奇姆·阿尔瓦在集会上讲话说，印度对美国给予巴基斯坦军事援助一事不能保持沉默，因为这威胁着印度的自由和安全。他说，从美国副总统尼克松宣布美国将把武器运给巴基斯坦的一天起，它就把冷战带到了印度的大门口。
    印度共产党议员布佩希·古普塔在讲话中指出，美国在巴基斯坦建立的军事基地威胁着亚非国家的独立和安全，它们是针对着新近解放的亚非国家的民主发展和经济进步的。古普塔说，美国企图通过这样的政策来分裂亚非国家的人民，把这些国家拖入冷战，并且准备进攻它们。
    古普塔谴责美国策划同巴基斯坦签订双边军事协定，并且指出，人们不应该信赖美国的虚伪保证。他要求亚非国家同社会主义国家团结起来，并且进行合作，来粉碎帝国主义国家的阴谋。
    印度外交部副部长梅农夫人也出席了这次集会。
