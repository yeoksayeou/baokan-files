Hygiene for Production, Production Emphasizing Hygiene
Shanghai Medical Personnel Go to Factories and Rural Areas to Serve Production

    (Our report) To cooperate with this year's greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Shanghai's health departments have decided to vigorously carry out the work of eliminating pests and diseases, and continue to transfer and send medical personnel to factories, construction sites, and rural areas to strengthen preventive health organizations at the grassroots production units.
    This year, Shanghai's total industrial output value will increase by 55% compared to last year. In terms of improving labor productivity, the requirement is for one person to accomplish the work of one and a half people last year. At the city's health work leap forward conference in early March, the city's Chinese and Western medicine doctors and professors, around this inspiring target, and based on the principle of "hygiene for production, production emphasizing hygiene," confidently formulated this year's city's health work plan to serve industrial and agricultural production. On the basis of the large-scale pest and disease elimination campaign launched last year and the control already achieved over several common occupational diseases, they will further strengthen the unity and cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, and strive to comprehensively control silicosis, the most serious occupational disease endangering workers' health, as well as severe heatstroke, benzene poisoning, mercury poisoning, and other occupational diseases within this year. At the same time, medical personnel will conduct investigations and research by going down to the workshops, assist factories in improving labor hygiene conditions and environmental sanitation, and further reduce workers' absenteeism due to illness.
    In 1958, in Shanghai, 10 industries related to silica dust, including glass products, enamel, and welding rods, 7 industries and 101 factories had taken comprehensive measures combining improved operations with good healthcare and cleaning, reducing the silica dust in the workshops to about 2 milligrams per cubic meter, basically meeting the national standards, and freeing workers from the harm of silicosis caused by inhaling silica dust. Currently, in the iron-casting industry, where there are more factories, the preliminary success has been achieved in preventing silica dust from flying by using wet operations and other comprehensive measures in sand turning. Before National Day this year, this problem will be solved in various industries.
    For high-temperature operations, which involve more than 100,000 workers, medical units have decided to first take effective cooling measures in the steel, machinery, and electricity industries, which have the heaviest production tasks and the largest number of people this year. The main focus will be on promoting various indigenous ventilation and heat insulation methods created and invented by workers last year, striving to ensure that severe heatstroke does not occur in these industries' factories during this summer and autumn, guaranteeing attendance.
    Some health research institutions, in response to the gradual development of Shanghai's industrial production towards high-level, precision, large-scale, and cutting-edge, have successively established protection and supervision groups in the production and application of radioactive materials, as well as six groups studying the prevention and treatment of soft tissue injuries, joint reduction techniques, etc., such as falls, crushes, dislocations, and other injuries in production. Guangci Hospital has determined to focus on Shanggang No. 3 Factory, Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, and Shenxin No. 9 Factory to conduct investigations and research, controlling industrial burns, crushing injuries, skin diseases, and other illnesses.
    For newly built and expanded factories, as well as counties (suburbs) recently assigned to Shanghai, which urgently need to strengthen medical forces, hospitals, clinics, and prevention and treatment centers in the urban area have transferred and are about to send more than 470 doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other personnel to support them. Medical and health units in various districts of Shanghai have also been linked with various counties, responsible for training primary and intermediate medical personnel for the hospitals of various counties and people's communes. At the same time, a fixed system of mutual support, experience exchange, and consultation has been established between districts (medical colleges) and counties. This spring, medical units throughout the city will also organize forces to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the city's public canteens, nurseries, and food industry, continue to train health workers, cooks, and childcare workers, and further consolidate and improve the health work of collective living welfare undertakings.

    卫生为生产  生产讲卫生
    上海医务人员下厂下乡为生产服务
    本报讯　上海市卫生部门为配合今年工农业生产更大跃进，决定大力开展除害灭病工作，继续抽调和下放医务人员到工厂、工地和农村去，加强生产基层单位的预防保健组织。
    今年上海工业总产值将比去年增长55％，在提高劳动生产率方面，要求一个人抵去年一个半人。全市的医疗卫生单位和医学院校的中西医师、教授，在3月上旬全市卫生工作跃进大会上，围绕着这个振奋人心的指标，根据“卫生为生产，生产讲卫生”的方针，满怀信心地订出了今年全市卫生工作为工农业生产服务的规划，要在去年展开的大规模除害灭病和已经控制了几种常见职业病的基础上，进一步加强中西医团结合作，争取在今年内全面控制危害工人健康最严重的矽肺病，以及重症中暑、苯中毒、汞中毒等职业病；同时通过医务人员下车间调查研究，协助工厂改进劳动卫生条件和环境卫生，进一步降低工人因病缺勤率。
    在1958年，上海全市十个与矽尘有关的行业，已有玻璃品、搪瓷、电焊棒等七个行业一百零一家工厂采取改进操作和做好保健、清洁卫生相结合的综合措施，把车间里的含矽粉尘，减少到了每立方公尺二毫克左右，基本上达到了国家标准的要求，使工人们摆脱了由于吸入矽尘而生矽肺病的危害。目前，工厂较多的铸铁行业，在翻砂中试用湿式操作等综合措施，防止矽尘飞扬，也得到了初步成功。到今年国庆节以前，这个问题将在各个行业中解决。
    对于有十多万工人接触到的高温作业，各医务单位决定首先在今年生产任务最重、人数较多的钢铁、机械、电力三个行业，采取有效的降温措施，主要推广去年工人群众创造发明的各种通风、隔热的土办法，争取今年夏秋季在这些行业的工厂不发生重症中暑，保证出勤。
    一些卫生研究机构，针对着上海工业生产逐步向高级、精密、大型、尖端的方向发展，已陆续建立了含放射性物质生产及应用中的防护监督小组，以及研究防治生产中跌伤、压伤、脱骱等软组织损伤、关节复位手法等六个小组。广慈医院确定以上钢三厂、上海电机厂、申新九厂为重点进行调查研究，控制工业烧伤、轧伤、皮肤病等疾病。
    对于迫切需要加强医务力量的新建、扩建工厂，以及新近划归上海的各县（郊区），市区的各医院、诊所、防治所已抽调出和即将下放医师、护士、药剂人员等四百七十多人去支援。上海市各区各医疗卫生单位还同各县挂钩，负责为各县和人民公社的医院训练初级和中级的医务人员，同时区（医学院）县之间建立了固定的相互支援力量、经验交流和会诊的联系制度。在春季里，全市各医务单位还将组织力量对全市的公共食堂、托儿所、饮食行业进行全面检查，继续培训保健员、炊事员、保育员，进一步巩固提高集体生活福利事业的卫生工作。　　　　（陆左华）
