    Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, March 19th: Yugoslav newspapers have for the past two days continuously attacked and slandered Iraq concerning the tense relations between the United Arab Republic and Iraq.

    Yesterday's "Wednesday News" attempted in a commentary to portray the treasonous conspiracy cases uncovered in Iraq as a power struggle between individuals. It insisted that the basic characteristic of several anti-Iraqi riots was "besides the struggle for power among the organizers and executors of the coup d'état (referring to the July 14th Revolution), also—or at least now—the question of Iraq's foreign policy direction."

    The commentary perversely asserted that Iraq had fallen into "isolation" because it had maintained its status as an independent sovereign state. It said: "Events inside and outside Iraq have placed the new Iraqi Republic in an isolated international position. The characteristic of this position is that it has no support from either side in the Arab countries." The commentary said that the unification of Egypt and Syria had created a movement for unification in the Arab countries. Echoing the UAR's interventionist tone, it said: "This movement is also accepted by the majority of the Iraqi people."

    This Yugoslav newspaper, in the same tone as the UAR's anti-communists, blamed Iraq entirely for the deterioration of relations between the United Arab Republic and Iraq. It wrote that the deterioration and confusion in relations with the UAR had "separated Iraq from the Arab unity movement and excluded it (Iraq) from cooperation in general Arab international politics." The commentary's author made no secret of his malice towards the Iraqi Republic, saying that "General Qassem's government sensed the increasingly embarrassing international isolation of the Iraqi Republic."

    "Wednesday News" also followed behind the imperialist propaganda machine, spreading rumors and sowing discord, saying: "In an isolated international position, in a dispute with the UAR, which has an indisputable influence in the Middle East Arab world, the domestic political situation is not very stable, and there is a strong opposition among the officers of the Iraqi army. Iraq is at a major turning point that will determine its fate."

    Yugoslavia's "Liberation Daily" also recently published a commentary, talking at length about the "crisis in Iraq's national policy and foreign policy direction," and falsely asserted that this "crisis" "occurred due to the sudden deterioration of relations between Iraq and the UAR." This newspaper lamented Shawwaf's failure and obscured the nature of the Shawwaf rebellion. The newspaper said, "Colonel Shawwaf's riot lasted too short and was suppressed too quickly to see its true face, and to evaluate its true motives and purposes." "However, it still reveals some factors that characterize the current Iraqi crisis. The most obvious factor is the dissatisfaction of those officers under Colonel Shawwaf with General Qassem's regime relying on left-wing politicians, especially relying on the Iraqi Communist Party."

### 南斯拉夫报纸攻击伊拉克  附和阿联干涉主义的论调为沙瓦夫叛乱失败而惋惜

    南斯拉夫报纸攻击伊拉克
    附和阿联干涉主义的论调为沙瓦夫叛乱失败而惋惜
    新华社贝尔格莱德19日电  南斯拉夫一些报纸两天来连续就阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克之间的紧张关系攻击和诬蔑伊拉克。
    昨天出版的“星期三消息报”在一篇评论中首先企图把伊拉克破获的一些叛国阴谋案件说成是个人之间的争权夺利。它硬说：几次反伊拉克的暴乱的基本特点是，“除了在政变（指7月14日革命）的组织者和执行者间争夺政权的斗争这个因素以外，还在于——或者至少现在还在于——伊拉克对外政策方针的问题。”
    评论颠倒是非地认为，伊拉克因维护了自己的独立的主权国的地位而陷于“孤立”。它说：“伊拉克国内外的事件，使新的伊拉克共和国处于孤立的国际地位。这种地位的特点是在阿拉伯国家的任何一方都没有依靠”。评论说，埃及和叙利亚的统一，在阿拉伯国家中产生了争取统一的运动。它附和阿联的干涉主义论调说：“这一运动也为大部分伊拉克人民所接受”。
    这家南斯拉夫报纸同阿联反共者一个声调，把阿拉伯联合共和国同伊拉克的关系恶化的责任一股脑儿推在伊拉克身上。它写道，同阿联关系的恶化和混乱把“伊拉克从阿拉伯团结运动中分离了出来，并把它（伊拉克）从一般的阿拉伯国际政策的合作中排斥了出来”。评论作者毫不掩饰自己对伊拉克共和国的恶意，说什么“卡塞姆将军的政府觉察到了伊拉克共和国所处的这种国际孤立的愈益尴尬的地位。”
    “星期三消息报”还跟在帝国主义宣传机关的屁股后面造谣挑拨说：“在孤立的国际地位中，在同中东阿拉伯世界中拥有无可争辩的影响的阿联的纠纷中，国内的政治局势不很安定，在伊拉克军队的军官中有强大的反对派。伊拉克正处在重大的决定命运的转折点上。”
    南斯拉夫的“解放报”最近也发表评论，大谈“伊拉克国家政策和对外政策方针的危机”，并虚妄地断言这一“危机”“发生于伊拉克和阿联关系的突然恶化。”这家报纸为沙瓦夫失败而惋惜，并掩饰沙瓦夫叛乱的性质。报纸说，“沙瓦夫上校的暴乱延续得太短，被镇压得太快，以至不能看清它的真面目，不能评价它的真正的动机和目的。”“但是，它仍然揭示了作为目前伊拉克危机特征的某些因素。最明显的因素就是沙瓦夫上校所属的那些军官对于卡塞姆将军的政权依靠左派的政治人士，特别是依靠伊拉克共产党的不满。”
