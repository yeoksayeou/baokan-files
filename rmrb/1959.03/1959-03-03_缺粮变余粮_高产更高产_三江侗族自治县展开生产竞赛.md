From Grain Shortage to Surplus: Higher Yields, Even Higher Yields
Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County Launches Production Competition

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in Guangxi Province is striving for an average rice yield of 5,000 jin per mu this year. The 180,000 people of all ethnic groups in the county are ambitious and are launching a vigorous socialist friendship competition to achieve this goal.

Before 1958, Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County had always been a grain-deficient mountainous area. Last year, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the Dong, Miao, Yao, Zhuang, and Han ethnic groups in the county greatly liberated their thinking and planted early rice on a large scale for the first time. After a year of hard work, they jumped to become a surplus grain county. Now, after discussions by cadres and people of all ethnic groups throughout the county, an even greater leap forward plan than last year has been formulated. In order to realize this year's leap forward plan, the autonomous county has adopted the following measures:

	(1) Implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and carry out technological innovation. 95% of the fields in the county will be deeply ploughed to a depth of eight inches or more; a plan is in place to apply 5,000 dan of fertilizer per mu. (2) Vigorously launch mass movements and stir up a mass-based socialist friendship competition. The slogan for the competition and evaluation in the county is "A Great Leap Forward in Production, Always Strive for First Place; Heroes Compete Together, See Who Gets the Championship." (3) Adhere to democratic management, with cadres taking the lead in participating in production and promoting advanced experience. Prepare to send a group of leading cadres to strengthen leadership over the communes and teams. (4) Work hard and cleverly, and arrange labor well. This year, we must focus on grain, ensuring that more than 70% of the labor force is invested in agricultural production. (5) Strengthen political and ideological work, focusing on raising communist consciousness and establishing various production responsibility systems.

Currently, the leap forward plan of 5,000 jin of rice per mu is inspiring the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County. On the day of Lichun (Start of Spring), according to the past ethnic customs here, people simply held chicken feathers, faced in all directions, and said "Welcoming Spring," and sowing would only begin when the tung trees bloomed. This year is different. Before Lichun, not only has the task of deep plowing and the "Three Lights" (removing, clearing, and burning all weeds) on the ridges been completed, but also the tasks of seedling management, manure accumulation, harrowing, and sowing have all been advanced by two seasons compared to 1958.

    缺粮变余粮　高产更高产
    三江侗族自治县展开生产竞赛
    据新华社讯  广西三江侗族自治县，今年争取全县水稻平均亩产五千斤。全县十八万各族人民，雄心勃勃，正为实现这个指标开展了热火朝天的社会主义友谊竞赛运动。
    三江侗族自治县在1958年以前，一直是个缺粮的山区。去年，这个县的侗、苗、瑶、僮、汉等族人民，在党的领导下，思想大解放，第一次大面积种植早稻，经过一年苦战，一跃而成为余粮县。现在，经过全县干部和各族人民的讨论，已制定出比去年更大的跃进计划。为了实现今年跃进计划，自治县采取的措施是：
      （1）贯彻“八字宪法”，进行技术革新。全县95％的田深耕达到八寸以上；每亩计划施肥五千担。（2）大搞群众运动，大张旗鼓地掀起群众性的社会主义友谊竞赛。这个县竞赛评比的口号是“生产大跃进、永争第一名；英雄齐比武，看谁得冠军”。（3）坚持民主管理，干部带头参加生产，推广先进经验。准备下放一批领导骨干加强对社、队的领导。（4）苦干、巧干，安排好劳力。今年要突出地抓粮食，保证70％以上的劳动力投入农业生产。（5）加强政治思想工作，突出地抓提高共产主义觉悟和建立各种生产责任制。
    现在，水稻亩产五千斤的跃进规划正激发着三江侗族自治县各族人民的干劲。立春那一天，过去这里的民族风俗习惯，人们只是拿着鸡毛，面向四方，表示“迎春”，播种工作要等到桐树开花的季节才开始；今年不同了，立春前不仅完成了深耕和田头杂草的三光（除光、铲光、烧光）任务，秧田管理、积肥、耙田、播种等各项工作，都比1958年提前了两个季节。
