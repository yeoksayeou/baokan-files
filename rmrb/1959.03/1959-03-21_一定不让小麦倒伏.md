We Must Not Allow Wheat to Lodge
Commentator of this Newspaper

Since the beginning of spring, various regions have been fiercely attacking the spring greening of wheat, and the battle to strive for more plants and more ears has achieved a decisive victory. At present, general wheat fields have about 500,000 seedlings per mu, and high-yield fields have 700,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu, making a bumper harvest even more promising. The vernal equinox has arrived, and wheat in the main wheat-producing areas across the country is about to joint and elongate. This is one of the most important periods for wheat growth and development, and it is an important period to determine whether wheat will lodge and how many spikelets there will be.

What constitutes wheat yield is the number of ears per unit area, the number of grains per ear, and the weight of the grains; among them, the number of ears plays a decisive role. This year, the number of seedlings in general wheat fields has increased by two to three times compared to last year, and the number of ears may also be two to three times more than last year, so the yield may also be two to three times higher than last year. The increase in the number of plants is certainly a reliable guarantee for a greater wheat harvest this year; however, in the case of many plants, it also increases the possibility of lodging. Experience has proven that early lodging of wheat will cause a yield loss of about 50%; late lodging will also reduce production by 10% to 30%. Therefore, the current struggle to strive for a wheat bumper harvest should focus on preventing wheat lodging. We must do everything possible to ensure that wheat does not lodge. We must limit and even eliminate the possible negative effects of dense planting on high yields, so that the beneficial factors of dense planting for high yields can be fully utilized.

After wheat is densely planted, there are many plants and leaves, which are mutually occluded, hindering ventilation and light transmission, and the stems are thin and weak, which will lead to lodging, which is not conducive to improving yield. However, this unfavorable factor should not be regarded as absolute and unchanging. It should also be seen that although dense planting has the possibility of lodging, there is no inevitability of lodging. In 1958, China's wheat achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and many high-yield fields with an output of more than 1,000 catties per mu emerged. These high-yield fields all had more than 400,000 to 500,000 ears per mu, grew well, and mostly did not lodge. Many high-yield fields with an output of more than 2,000 to 3,000 catties per mu reached about 1 million ears per mu, with strong stalks, large ears, and full grains, and almost none lodged. On the other hand, last year, some high-yield fields, although only had 200,000 to 300,000 ears per mu, also experienced serious lodging, yielding only 200 to 300 catties. These examples show that wheat lodging is not simply due to dense planting. The direct cause of wheat lodging is that the stems are not strong enough, and the weight of the upper part of the wheat plant is not compatible with the supporting capacity of the lower stem. Last year's high-yield experience proves that the unfavorable factors of dense wheat planting on high yield can be overcome, and wheat lodging can be prevented; deep plowing of the land, sufficient base fertilizer, selection of strong-stalked varieties, and rational and uniform dense planting are the basis for preventing wheat lodging; on this basis, further strengthening cultivation management to promote deep rooting of wheat roots and strong stems can effectively prevent wheat lodging.

Now, some people see that wheat plants are numerous and vigorous, stems and leaves are lush, and growth is vigorous, and they are worried about wheat lodging in the later stage; this worry is not without basis. The question is what attitude and action to take while worrying. Some people take a passive attitude, are tied up, and dare not water and topdress, for fear that wheat will grow excessively and lodge. This is actually a lack of confidence in striving for high yields, and it is also a manifestation of one-sidedness in thinking methods. We must see that the favorable factors are the mainstream: this year, the area of improved wheat varieties nationwide has reached 90%; most wheat fields have been deeply plowed about one foot; 10,000 to 20,000 catties of base fertilizer are applied per mu, or even more; various methods are used to evenly sow and densely plant, and the sowing quality is very good. These are good conditions for preventing and reducing lodging. At present, the general 500,000 seedlings per mu is not too dense compared with last year's 1,000-catty fields. As long as watering and topdressing are rational and post-management is strengthened, it is entirely possible to prevent wheat from lodging.

What is rational watering and rational topdressing? Obviously, not watering and not topdressing do not meet the normal requirements of wheat growth and are unreasonable. Rational means to look at the weather, look at the land, and look at the crops, and flexibly grasp the amount and time of water and fertilizer. The supply of water and fertilizer must not only meet the needs of wheat growth and development in a timely manner, but also prevent excessive and rapid supply; it must not only make the stems and leaves strong, but also not make the stems and leaves too lush.

Water is the source of wheat's life. When the soil moisture content is less than 70% of the saturated water content, it will hinder wheat growth. During the jointing period, wheat stems elongate rapidly, and at the same time, the florets differentiate, and the metabolism is vigorous. The need for water is the most urgent and sensitive, which is the so-called "critical period" for water. Lack of water during this period will make the plant short, the ear small, and the grains few, and some tillers will not be able to joint and become ineffective tillers. If there is too much water, it will cause the base nodes of wheat to elongate excessively, the cells to become larger, the cell walls to become thinner, the stalks to become soft and the stems to become weak, and it will be easy to lodge. Therefore, watering must be adapted to the specific conditions of different wheat fields. For wheat fields that are dry and lack water and the wheat seedlings are not vigorous, it is necessary to combine topdressing and water early and heavily for the jointing water. For wheat fields where wheat seedlings grow very vigorously and the soil is not very dry, the jointing water can be appropriately delayed, and the seedlings can be suppressed to inhibit the growth of wheat seedlings; that is to say, do not water at the beginning of jointing, and water after the jointing is over. For wheat fields where the situation is between the two, the jointing water can be watered twice: first, water a little to keep the soil moist and prevent the wheat from being droughted; after the jointing, water again.

Fertilizer is the main material condition for increasing wheat production. Wheat has the most vigorous photosynthesis from jointing to heading, and a large amount of dry matter must be accumulated during this period. If there is insufficient fertilizer during this period, it will reduce the number of grains set and the ears will be small and the grains few. However, applying a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer during this period will make the leaves too wide, reduce light at the base, and the stems are prone to excessive growth, and the lignification of the cell walls will also be hindered. Moreover, because the upper stems and leaves are too lush, the burden on the base stems is increased, and the area exposed to wind and rain is also increased, which will increase the possibility of wheat lodging. Therefore, topdressing must also be adapted to the specific conditions of different wheat fields. For the third-category wheat fields with few and weak seedlings, more quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer should be applied before and after the wheat jointing, and the amount of fertilizer should not be reduced for fear of causing excessive growth and lodging. For some wheat fields where the wheat seedlings are very dense and growing too vigorously, it is necessary to supplement fertilizer according to the seedlings, and it is not appropriate to apply a large amount of quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer. Many experimental studies and production practices have proved that increasing the application of quick-acting phosphate and potash fertilizers before wheat jointing can promote the thickening of stem cell walls, promote strong stems, and increase wheat's resistance to lodging. According to the analysis of some high-yield typical materials of wheat in 1958, the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in spring topdressing is about 1:1.5:3, 4. This also shows that applying a large amount of phosphate and potash fertilizers during this period, combined with a small amount of nitrogen fertilizer, can achieve the purpose of non-lodging and high yield. Potash fertilizer should be applied as early as possible. In the past, the effect of potash fertilizer application in some places was not good, mostly because the application time was too late. After wheat jointing and heading, when the stems have formed, topdressing with potash fertilizer has little effect.

If you think that strictly controlling the amount of water and fertilizer during this period can prevent wheat lodging, it is also not comprehensive. It should be recognized that the causes of any phenomenon in the crop growth process are very complicated, and lodging is caused by many factors before and after, inside and outside. Therefore, to ensure that wheat does not lodge, it is also necessary to comprehensively observe and take various effective measures to strengthen wheat stems and consolidate root growth.

The experience of many areas has proven that appropriately harrowing and pressing wheat before jointing can make the wheat roots and tillering nodes closely connected with the topsoil, strengthen the ability to support the stems, and also inhibit the growth of the main stem, making the wheat nodes shorter and stronger, and promote the rapid growth of wheat tillers, catching up with the main stem, with uniform heading and consistent maturity. In places where wheat has not yet jointed, this method can be appropriately adopted according to local conditions. In the south, there is a lot of rain, and the wheat fields are submerged in water for a long time, the topsoil is thin and soft, and the wheat roots are easily loosened, resulting in root lodging of wheat; therefore, the ditches should be cleaned and drained frequently, and the soil in the ditches should be used to cultivate the wheat roots.

Even if the above series of measures are taken, some highly densely planted, heavily fertilized, and well-watered high-yield wheat fields will inevitably have excessive stem and leaf growth, and thin and weak stems. According to last year's experience, this kind of potentially lodged wheat field can also be rescued in time. It is best to tie them into small bundles before the wheat is about to lodge but not yet lodged, and then insert a stick in the middle to keep the wheat plants firmly standing. If you support and tie them after the wheat has lodged, it will often cause greater losses. But do not tie them too early or too tightly, so as not to hinder the normal grain filling and maturity of wheat.

At present, wheat is transitioning from the greening period to the jointing period, and many regions have timely raised the issue of preventing wheat lodging, which is a major issue for further strengthening wheat field management and a key measure to ensure a bumper wheat harvest this year. Now the time is imminent, and all communes and teams should immediately mobilize the masses to invest in the struggle to prevent wheat lodging from many aspects. We must talk about the importance of preventing wheat lodging to ensure a bumper harvest, and we must also universally and specifically summarize the past experience in preventing lodging, concentrate more and better methods, boost greater revolutionary vigor, and carry out wheat field management work centered on preventing lodging. We must go deep into the fields, carefully check the implementation of various lodging prevention measures segment by segment and block by block, and make up for what is lacking. We must adapt measures to local conditions, adapt measures to the time, and adapt measures to the seedlings, do everything possible, take all effective measures, overcome the harm of lodging, and ensure a greater wheat harvest this year.

    一定不让小麦倒伏
    本报评论员
    入春以来，各地猛攻小麦返青关，争取株多穗多的战斗已经取得了决定性的胜利。目前一般麦田每亩都有五十万苗左右，丰产田每亩有七、八十万苗，丰收已经更有希望。春分已到，全国主要麦产区的小麦即将拔节伸长。这是小麦生长发育最重要的时期之一，是决定小麦是否倒伏、小穗籽粒多少的重要时期。
    构成小麦产量的是单位面积上的穗数，每穗粒数和籽粒的重量；其中起决定性作用的还是穗数。今年一般麦田的苗数比去年增加了两三倍，穗数就有可能也比去年多两三倍，因此产量也有可能比去年高两三倍。株数增多固然是今年小麦更大丰收的一项可靠的保证；但是，在株多的情况下，也增加了倒伏的可能。经验证明，小麦早期倒伏会使产量损失50％左右；晚期倒伏，也会减产10％到30％。因此，当前争取小麦丰收的斗争，重点应当放到防止小麦倒伏上。必须想尽一切办法，一定不让小麦倒伏。要限制以至消灭密植对于高产的不利因素可能发挥的作用，才能使密植对于高产的有利因素充分发挥作用。
    小麦密植以后，株多叶多，互相郁闭，妨碍通风透光，茎秆细弱，就会倒伏，不利于产量的提高。但是，对于这不利的因素，也不能看成绝对的、不变的。也要看到：密植固然有倒伏的可能性，而并没有倒伏的必然性。1958年我国小麦获得了史无前例的丰收，涌现出许多大面积亩产千斤以上的高额丰产田，这些高额丰产田每亩都在四十万穗、五十万穗以上，生长良好，大都没有倒伏。许多亩产两三千斤以上的高额丰产田每亩达到一百万穗左右，麦秆壮，穗头大，籽粒饱，几乎都没有倒伏。另一方面，去年也有一些丰产田，虽然每亩只有二十万到三十万穗，也发生严重倒伏现象，只收二百到三百斤。这些实例说明：小麦倒伏不是单纯地由于密植。小麦倒伏的直接原因是茎秆不够粗壮，麦株上部重量和下部茎秆的支持能力不相适应。去年的高产经验证明：小麦密植对高产的不利因素是可以克制的，小麦倒伏是可以防止的；深翻土地，施足底肥，选用秆硬良种，合理匀播密植，是防止小麦倒伏的基础；在这个基础上进一步加强栽培管理，促使麦根深扎、茎秆粗壮，就可以有效地防止小麦倒伏。
    现在，有些人看到小麦株多苗旺，茎叶繁茂，生长旺盛，担心小麦后期倒伏；这种担心不是毫无根据的。问题在于在担心的同时采取什么样的态度和行动。有些人采取消极的态度，束手束脚，不敢浇水追肥，唯恐小麦徒长倒伏。这实际上是对于争取高产信心不足，也是思想方法上的片面性的表现。必须看到有利因素是主流：今年全国小麦良种面积达到90％；大部麦田深翻一尺左右；亩施底肥一二万斤，甚至更多；采用各种办法匀播密植，播种质量很好。这些正是防止和减轻倒伏的良好的条件。目前一般每亩五十万苗左右，与去年的千斤田比较，也不算太密。只要合理浇水追肥，加强后期管理，完全可以叫小麦不倒。
    怎样才算合理浇水、合理追肥呢？显然，不浇水，不追肥是不符合小麦生长的正常要求的，也是不合理的。合理，就是要看天、看地、看庄稼，灵活地掌握水、肥用量和时间。水、肥的供应既要及时满足小麦生长发育的需要，又要防止过多、过猛；既要使茎叶健壮，又要不使茎叶过于繁茂。
    水是小麦的生命的源泉。当土壤含水量少于饱和水量的70％的时候，就会妨碍小麦的生长。拔节时期，小麦茎秆迅速伸长，同时小花分化，新陈代谢作用旺盛，对水分的需要最迫切、最敏感，正是所谓对水分的“临界期”。在这一时期缺少水分，就会使植株矮小、穗小粒少，有些分蘖就会不能拔节，成为无效分蘖。如果水分太多，就会使小麦基部茎节过度伸长，细胞变大，细胞壁变薄，秆软茎弱，容易倒伏。因此，浇水必须适应不同麦田的具体情况。对于地干水缺、麦苗不旺的麦田，需要结合追肥，早浇和大浇拔节水。对于麦苗生长很旺，土壤不很干的麦田，可以适当延迟拔节水，蹲一蹲苗，抑制一下麦苗的生长；也就是说，在初拔节时不浇，等拔节过后再浇。对于情况处于两者之间的麦田，可以把拔节水分两次浇：先小浇一水，保持土壤湿润，不让小麦受旱；待拔节过后，再浇一水。
    肥料是小麦增产的主要物质条件，小麦从拔节到抽穗，光合作用最盛，大量干物质要在这个时期积累起来。这个时期如果肥料不足，就会减少结实粒数，穗小粒少。但是，在这时期施用大量氮肥，会使叶片过于宽大，基部光照减少，茎秆容易徒长，细胞壁的木质化也会受到阻碍。而且，由于上部茎叶过于繁茂，加重了基部茎秆的负担，也增加了遭受风吹雨打的面积，都会加大小麦倒伏的可能性。因此，追肥也要适应不同麦田的具体情况。对于苗少苗弱的三类麦田，在小麦拔节前后，应该多施速效性氮肥，不能因为怕引起徒长倒伏而减少施肥量。对于某些麦苗生长很密、发育过旺的麦田，就要看苗补肥，不宜大量施用速效性氮肥。许多试验研究和生产实践证明，在小麦拔节前增施速效性磷肥钾肥，可以促进茎秆细胞壁加厚，促使茎秆强壮，增加小麦抗倒伏能力。根据1958年的一些小麦高产典型材料分析，春季追肥中氮、磷、钾的比例约为1∶1.5∶3、4。这也说明，在这一时期施用大量的磷肥钾肥，配合少量的氮肥，可以达到不倒和高产的目的。钾肥应该尽早施用。过去有些地方施用钾肥的效果不好，大都是因为施用的时间太晚。在小麦拔节抽穗以后，茎秆已经形成的时候，追施钾肥，作用不大。
    如果认为只要严格控制这一时期的水、肥用量，就可防止小麦倒伏，那也是不全面的。应该认识到作物生长过程中的任何一种现象形成的原因，都是十分复杂的，而倒伏更是前前后后、里里外外的许多因素造成的。因此，要确保小麦不倒伏，还必须全面地观察，采取各种有效措施，强壮小麦茎秆，巩固根系生长。
    许多地区的经验证明：在拔节以前适当耙麦、压麦，可以使麦根和分蘖节与表土密接，加强支持茎秆的能力，还可以抑制主茎生长，使小麦茎节较短较壮，并促进小麦分蘖迅速生长，赶上主茎，抽穗整齐，成熟一致。在小麦还没有拔节的地方，可以根据当地具体条件，适当采用这个方法。南方雨多，麦田长期渍水，表土稀软，容易松动麦根，发生小麦根部倒伏；因此，应该经常清沟排水，并用沟中泥土培壅麦根。
    即使采取了以上一系列的措施，某些高度密植、肥多水足的丰产麦田也还难免茎叶徒长，茎秆细弱。根据去年经验，对这种可能倒伏的麦田也可以及时抢救。最好在小麦将倒未倒以前扎成小把，中间再插一根棍子，让麦株牢牢站住。如果等小麦倒伏以后才扶才扎，往往会造成更大损失。但也不要扎得太早太紧，以免妨碍小麦正常灌浆成熟。
    目前小麦正在由返青期进入拔节期，很多地区及时地提出了防止小麦倒伏的问题，这是进一步加强麦田管理的重大问题，也是保证今年小麦大丰收的关键性措施之一。现在时机已迫在眉睫，各社各队应当立即发动群众，从多方面投入防止小麦倒伏的斗争。要大讲防止小麦倒伏确保丰收的重要意义，也要普遍地具体地总结以往防止倒伏的经验，集中更多更好的办法，鼓起更大革命干劲，开展以防止倒伏为中心的小麦田间管理工作。要深入田间，逐段逐块细致检查各种防止倒伏措施的执行情况，缺什么就补什么。要因时因地因苗制宜，想尽千方百计，采取一切有效措施，战胜倒伏这一害，确保今年小麦更大丰收。
