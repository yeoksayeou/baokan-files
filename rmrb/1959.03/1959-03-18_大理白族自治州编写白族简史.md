The Bai "Brief History" mainly reflects the history of production and class struggle of the Bai people and working people of all nationalities, especially the history of revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Party.

The "Overview of Autonomous Regions" mainly reflects the basic situation of the autonomous prefecture and the great achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

These three books are being compiled by an investigation team composed of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, Yunnan University, the Yunnan Provincial Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Dali Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At the end of last year, they went to Dali, Jianchuan and other counties in the autonomous prefecture, went deep into the countryside, and conducted comprehensive investigations and interviews among the masses. The first drafts of these three series of books will be completed by the end of April.

    大理白族自治州编写白族简史
    新华社昆明16日电　云南省大理白族自治州正积极编写白族“简史”、“简志”和“自治地方概况”，反映白族人民在党和毛主席领导下十年来获得的光辉成就。
    白族“简史”主要是反映白族和各民族劳动人民生产和阶级斗争的历史，特别是在党的领导下进行革命斗争的历史。“简志”主要是反映白族和州内各民族当前发展阶段的政治、经济、文化和生活面貌及其特点。“自治地方概况”主要是反映自治州基本情况以及社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。
    这三本书是由中国科学院、中央民族学院、云南大学、中共云南省党校和中共大理地委共同组成的调查组编写的。他们在去年年底分赴自治州大理、剑川等县，深入农村，在群众中进行了全面调查和访问，这三本丛书将在4月底写成初稿。
