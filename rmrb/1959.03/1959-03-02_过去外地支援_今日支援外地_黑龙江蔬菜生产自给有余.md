　　Heilongjiang, March 2nd (This Newspaper) - The broad masses of people in Heilongjiang's urban and rural areas, even during the long, frigid winter and spring, are able to eat large quantities of fresh vegetables, just like those in the Jiangnan region of the motherland. Heilongjiang, which has historically relied on other regions for vegetable support, is not only able to be self-sufficient but also transfers large quantities of vegetables to support major cities and construction/mining areas like Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Liaoning.

　　In the past, people always thought that Heilongjiang's cold climate, short frost-free period, and difficulty in producing vegetables made self-sufficiency impossible; even if more were produced, it would be difficult to store and preserve them. Therefore, it was considered a matter of course that the winter and spring vegetable supply depended on external assistance every year. However, during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, old ideas changed. Heilongjiang's commercial and agricultural departments worked together to vigorously grasp the "planting," "harvesting," "storage," and "sales" of vegetables. The agricultural departments expanded the vegetable planting area (increasing it by 640,000 hectares compared to 1957), increased fertilization, and strengthened technical guidance. The commercial departments also dispatched full-time resident cadres to the main vegetable production areas to cultivate sources of goods according to market needs and organize them for market in stages. Some commercial departments even organized manpower to rush planting, deliver manure, and apply fertilizer for the vegetable communes. The vegetable people's communes in various places also eliminated concerns such as "fear of the high risk of planting vegetables" by setting up experimental fields and organizing visits, and massively trial-planted vegetables such as onions and lettuce, and also expanded the area of greenhouse and hotbed production. Thus, even under the conditions of autumn vegetable disasters, the province still achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of vegetables, with output more than doubling that of 1957.

　　Under the leadership of the Party committees, all localities mobilized the entire population and organized various forces to rush harvest and store autumn vegetables. Last year, statistics from only eight cities in the province showed that more than one million person-times of cadres, students, workers, and street residents, as well as 250,000 vehicles, were organized and mobilized. After more than ten days of hard work, more than two million tons of vegetables were rushed in.

　　In order to keep the vegetables well-preserved, the commercial departments in various localities, based on the characteristics of short vegetable production time and reliance on stored autumn vegetables for winter and spring supply, adopted the method of "whoever plants stores, whoever eats stores, whoever supplies stores," and organized decentralized storage to store enough according to needs. Last year, eight cities in the province stored more than 400,000 tons of vegetables, ensuring the winter and spring vegetable supply in these cities. In addition, various places also vigorously engaged in making soy sauce, dried vegetables, and alkaline vegetables to facilitate vegetable preservation. In terms of vegetable supply, in addition to setting up supply points and ensuring regular supply, the commercial departments in various places also organized canteens of organs, factories, groups, and other units and vegetable communes in various places to directly link up to supply vegetables, so as to reduce circulation links and reduce losses.

　　The Heilongjiang Provincial Commercial Department is planning the 1959 vegetable work. Now, various places have started to cultivate and sow spring vegetables, and various fresh fine vegetables are also growing in greenhouses and hotbeds. This year, a large number of spring vegetables will be able to be put on the market ahead of schedule before the "May Day" festival. (Song Yuncang)

### 过去外地支援　今日支援外地  黑龙江蔬菜生产自给有余

    过去外地支援　今日支援外地
    黑龙江蔬菜生产自给有余
    本报讯　黑龙江广大城乡人民，在去冬今春漫长的严寒季节里，也像祖国的江南一样，能吃到大量的鲜菜。历来依靠外地支援蔬菜的黑龙江，不仅能够自给，而且，还调运出大批蔬菜支援北京、天津、上海、辽宁等大城市和工地矿区。
    过去，人们总认为黑龙江气候寒冷，无霜期短，生产蔬菜困难，无法自给；就是生产多了，也难以储存和保管。因此，认为每年冬春蔬菜供应依靠外援乃是天经地义的事。但是在大跃进的1958年，旧的观念改变了。黑龙江的商业和农业部门，通力协作，大抓蔬菜“种”“收”“储”“销”等工作。农业部门扩大了蔬菜播种面积（比1957年增加六十四万公顷），增加了施肥量，加强了技术指导。商业部门也在主要蔬菜生产地区，都派有专职驻社干部，根据市场需要，有计划的培植货源，分期组织上市。有的商业部门还组织人力为蔬菜公社抢种、送粪、施肥。各地蔬菜人民公社也通过搞试验田、组织参观等办法，消除了“怕种蔬菜风险大”等顾虑，大量试种了洋葱、窝笋等蔬菜，还扩大了温室、温床生产的面积。这样，虽然在秋季蔬菜遭灾的条件下，全省蔬菜还全面大丰收，产量比1957年提高了一倍多。
    各地在党委领导下，全民动员，组织各种力量对秋菜进行了抢收和储存工作。去年全省仅八个城市统计，共组织和动员了干部、学生、工人和街道居民等就有一百多万人次，车辆二十五万次，经过十多天苦战，就抢收了二百多万吨蔬菜。
    为了把蔬菜保管好，各地商业部门还根据蔬菜生产时间短，冬春全靠储存秋菜供应的特点，采取了谁种谁储、谁吃谁储、谁供谁储及按照需要储足留够的办法，组织分散储存，去年全省八个城市储存蔬菜即达四十多万吨，保证了这些城市冬春蔬菜供应。另外，各地还大搞酱、干、碱菜等，以利蔬菜保管。在蔬菜供应上，各地商业部门除设立供应点，做好经常的供应外，还组织机关、工厂、团体等伙食单位和各地蔬菜公社直接挂勾，供应蔬菜以减少流转环节，减少损失。
    黑龙江省商业部门正在规划1959年蔬菜工作。现在，各地已着手培育和播种春菜，温室和温床里也正生长着各种新鲜的细菜。今年大量春菜将能提前在“五一”节前上市。　（宋云仓）
