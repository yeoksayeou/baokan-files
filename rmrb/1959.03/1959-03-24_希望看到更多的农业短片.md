    Hoping to See More Agricultural Short Films
    Zhu Jiang

    Recently, I had the opportunity to see an excellent short film in Guilin - "Hubei's Ten Thousand Jin Mu;" spending only two fen, the education received was substantial.

    This film is particularly outstanding in breaking superstitions, liberating thought, mobilizing the masses to engage in high-yield experimental fields, and overcoming natural disasters. It correctly reflects the tremendous achievements of the Changfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hubei. After watching it, I kept thinking: If this film could be quickly shown in rural areas across the country, allowing hundreds of millions of farmers to see it, it would certainly play a very good role in promoting a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1959.

    Indeed, the broad masses of farmers are now urgently requesting to see films that reflect the events of the Great Leap Forward. However, most of the films we can see in rural areas are not like this. In 1958, in the village where I live, we saw movies a total of five times. Each time, the films were mostly feature-length stories from two or three years ago, such as "The White Haired Girl" and "The Heavenly Match." Farmers love these films, but they also hope to see more newsreels that can provide timely guidance to the struggle for production. For example, three months ago, the county film team came and showed two newsreels, one was a Soviet animated film, and the other was a newsreel about large-scale industrial development. The former was lively and interesting, and the latter described what everyone had just done, so it felt particularly intimate.

    Therefore, I think that if our film production companies can produce newsreels reflecting the current situation on various fronts more quickly, better, and more economically, and strengthen our screening teams to quickly cooperate with the current movements and show films in the vast rural areas, such as showing "Hubei's Ten Thousand Jin Mu" before rice transplanting, and immediately organizing mass discussions after the screening, then a film simultaneously and universally shown nationwide would be equivalent to holding an on-site conference attended by hundreds of millions of people, how wonderful that would be!

    希望看到更多的农业短片
    朱江
    最近我有机会在桂林看到了一个极好的短片——湖北万斤亩；只花两分钱，受到的教益却不少。
    这个片子在破除迷信、解放思想，动员群众大搞高产试验田，战胜自然灾害等方面表现得特别突出。它正确地反映了湖北长风农业生产合作社取得的巨大成绩。看完以后，我不断地想：如果这个片子能够很快地在全国农村中放映，让几亿农民都看到它，这对于推动1959年更大、更好、更全面的大跃进一定会起到很好的作用。
    真的，现在广大农民正迫切要求看到这种反映大跃进事迹的片子。但是，我们在农村所能看到的多数不是这样的片子。以1958年来说，在我居住的乡村，一共看到了五次电影。每次的影片大多是两三年前的长篇故事片，如“白毛女”、“天仙配”等等。农民很喜爱这些片子，但也还希望能多看到一些能及时指导生产斗争的新闻短片。像三个月前县里电影队来放了两部新闻短片，一个是苏联的动画片，一个是大办工业新闻片。前者生动有趣，后者描写的是大家刚干过的事，看来特别感到亲切。
    因此我想，如果我们的制片公司能多快好省地制造出反映当前各个战线的新闻短片来，又增强我们的放映队伍，迅速配合当前各个运动，在广大农村放映影片，如插秧前映出“湖北万斤亩”，等映出以后，立即组织群众漫谈讨论，如是，一部影片在全国范围内同时普遍映出，就等于召开了一个几亿人民参加的现场会议，那该多么好呵！
