    Support the Punishment of Scum Who Betray the Motherland

    To the Editor:
    This morning, we read the People's Daily news about "The State Council Orders the Dissolution of the Tibet Local Government" and the People's Liberation Army's campaign against the Tibetan armed rebels. We express our heartfelt support. As members of the national family, and as members of China's ethnic minorities, we feel extremely indignant at the actions of the Tibet Local Government and the upper-level reactionary clique colluding with imperialism, betraying the motherland, and undermining the unity and solidarity of the national family. We demand that the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet swiftly and thoroughly wipe out the rebels in the Tibetan region, cut off the evil claws of imperialism extending into our national family, and rescue the patriotic compatriots in Tibet.
    The unity of our national family is the fundamental interest of all nationalities in our country at present. Any remarks or actions that collude with imperialism to undermine the unification of the motherland, and incite or undermine the great unity of all nationalities, are acts that damage and violate the national interests of their own nationalities and the interests of the united family of all nationalities, and will be condemned and punished by the people of their own nationalities and the people of all fraternal nationalities. Therefore, we firmly support the decision of the State Council to remove the members of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and all posts of the traitors Sokang Wangqing Geleg and 17 others, and to punish them according to national laws. We also demand that those who have committed crimes of betraying the motherland and undermining national unity be given due legal punishment.

### 拥护惩处背叛祖国的败类

    拥护惩处背叛祖国的败类编辑同志：
    今天早晨，我们读了人民日报关于“国务院命令解散西藏地方政府”和解放军讨伐西藏武装叛匪的消息，我们衷心地表示拥护。我们作为民族大家庭的一员，作为我国少数民族的一员，对西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、破坏民族大家庭的统一和团结的行径感到无比的愤怒。我们要求驻藏中国人民解放军迅速地彻底地剿平西藏地区的叛匪，斩断帝国主义伸进我国民族大家庭的魔掌，解救西藏的爱国同胞。
    我国民族大家庭的团结一致，是当前我国各民族的根本利益，任何勾结帝国主义破坏祖国统一和挑拨、破坏各民族大团结的一切言论和行动，都是破坏和违背本民族的民族利益和各民族团结大家庭的利益的行为，都将受到本民族人民和各兄弟民族人民的谴责和惩罚。因此，我们坚决拥护国务院关于撤销叛国分子索康·旺清格勒等十八人的西藏自治区筹备委员会委员和一切职务，并按国家法律给予惩处的决定。并要求对背叛祖国、破坏民族团结有罪行的人，给予应有的法律惩处。
