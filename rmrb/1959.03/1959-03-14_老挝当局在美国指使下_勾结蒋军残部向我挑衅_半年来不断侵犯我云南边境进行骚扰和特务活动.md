Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The remnant armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, active in Phongsaly and Houei Sai provinces in Laos, have been constantly infringing upon various parts of our Yunnan border for the past six months. According to the information obtained, the activities of the Chiang army remnants are actively funded and supported by the Lao authorities. The Lao authorities allow the Chiang army remnants to establish secret bases, assemble and train, expand their forces, and provide them with food and ammunition in the northern border of Laos. They also condone and instigate them to repeatedly invade villages and towns on our Yunnan border, carrying out harassment, looting, and espionage activities. In September of last year, when the Chiang army remnants who had infiltrated into Burma advanced towards our Yunnan border in several routes, they were allowed to pass through Laos by the Lao authorities. The commander of the Lao Meng Hsin garrison also provided the Chiang army with a special ferry crossing on the Mekong River and invited the Chiang army leader to jointly plan military operations. The Lao authorities also handed over a large quantity of ammunition that was airdropped by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek in the first half of last year and fell into the hands of Laos to the Chiang army. In December of last year, the Lao military further secretly agreed with the Chiang army remnants to allow them to use Laos as a base for receiving American airdrops to the Chiang Kai-shek clique’s remnant armed forces and for harassing our Yunnan border.

At the same time, Lao military aircraft have also actively cooperated with the Chiang army remnants to repeatedly intrude into our airspace to carry out low-altitude reconnaissance and harassment activities. Since September of last year alone, according to incomplete statistics, Lao military aircraft have intruded into our airspace as many as nine times. Among them, on October 21, 1958, three aircraft intruded into the areas of Yiwu, Mengman, and Jiangcheng; and on January 16 and January 23 this year, Lao military aircraft successively intruded into the Mengla area to carry out low-altitude reconnaissance and harassment.

The Lao authorities also collude with and allow Chiang gang's espionage organizations to use the Meng Hsin area of Laos to carry out espionage and sabotage activities against us. They use border trade to continuously send spies to our Yunnan border to gather intelligence, spread rumors, and carry out activities to instigate rebellion.

The above-mentioned provocative actions carried out by the Lao authorities in collusion with the Chiang army remnants on our Yunnan border are supported and planned by US imperialism behind the scenes. In the past six months, personnel from the US military advisory group and economic survey group have frequently operated in the areas of Meng Hsin and Nam Tha on the Lao side, close to our Yunnan border, and American spies have established permanent institutions in the above-mentioned areas under the guise of medical activities. The American conspiracy is to instigate the Chiang army remnants and pro-American forces in Laos to provoke Sino-Lao border conflicts, in order to create excuses to gradually introduce military intervention by the United States and Southeast Asian aggressive blocs, and gradually drag Laos into the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc in some form, whether overt or covert.

### 老挝当局在美国指使下  勾结蒋军残部向我挑衅  半年来不断侵犯我云南边境进行骚扰和特务活动

    老挝当局在美国指使下
    勾结蒋军残部向我挑衅
    半年来不断侵犯我云南边境进行骚扰和特务活动
    新华社13日讯　活动在老挝境内丰沙里省和会晒省的蒋介石集团残余武装，半年来不断侵犯我云南边境各地。据所获资料证明，蒋军残部的活动是得到老挝当局的积极资助和支持的。老挝当局允许蒋军残部在老挝北部边界建立秘密基地，集结训练，扩充部队，资助他们粮食弹药，并纵容和策动他们多次侵犯我云南边境村寨，进行骚扰抢劫和特务情报活动。去年9月间，窜扰缅甸境内的蒋军残部分数路向我云南边境地区进犯时，曾获老挝当局允许假道，老挝孟新驻军司令也向该股蒋军提供湄公河上的专用渡口，并邀请该股蒋军头目共同策划军事行动。老挝当局还将去年上半年美蒋空投落入老挝方面手中的大批弹药移交给该股蒋军。去年12月间，老挝军方进一步同蒋军残部秘密协议，允许其利用老挝作为接受美国对蒋介石集团残余武装进行空投和向我云南边境进行骚扰的基地。
    与此同时，老挝军用飞机也积极配合蒋军残部多次侵入我国领空，进行低飞侦察骚扰活动。仅自去年9月以来，据不完全统计，老挝军用飞机侵入我国领空即达九批之多。其中1958年10月21日一天即有三架飞机侵入我易武、孟满、江城地区，今年1月16日和1月23日，老挝军用飞机又先后侵入我孟腊地区进行低空侦察骚扰。
    老挝当局还勾结和允许蒋帮特务组织利用老挝孟新地区对我进行谍报和破坏活动。他们利用边境商业往来，不断向我云南边境派遣特务，刺探情报，散布谣言，和进行策动叛乱的活动。
    老挝当局勾结蒋军残部在我云南边境进行的上述挑衅行动，是由美帝国主义在背后支持和策划的。近半年来美国军事顾问团人员及经济考察团人员经常活动于接近我云南边境的老挝方面孟新、南塔一带，美国特务人员并在医疗活动的伪装下在上述地区建立了常设机构。美国的阴谋是策动蒋军残部与老挝亲美势力挑起中老边境冲突，以便制造借口，逐步引进美国和东南亚侵略集团的军事干涉，逐步把老挝在某种或明或暗的形式下拖入东南亚侵略集团。
