Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 26th: More than ten million farmers in Hunan Province have plunged into a spring plowing production campaign centered on turning over paddy fields. From the shores of Dongting Lake to the foothills of the Five Ridges, from dawn till dusk, the fields are abuzz with activity, everywhere bustling with people transporting fertilizer, plowing, and building field ridges. Of the paddy fields suitable for plowing throughout the province, over 80% have already been plowed and harrowed once or twice, and approximately 20% of the early rice fields have been prepared to be level, muddy, and shimmering with water, ready for transplanting.

Based on years of experience in high-yield cultivation, early rice seedlings should be transplanted when they are young and robust, around twenty-five days old, into the fields. In order to avoid “seedlings waiting for fields,” this year, Party committees at all levels in Hunan, while mobilizing the masses to do a good job in sowing and raising seedlings, have also led the people's communes to comprehensively arrange agricultural work and launched the spring plowing campaign early. The Xiangtan Special District organized more than 320,000 people and more than 310,000 head of draught cattle to form specialized plowing teams, launching a competition to compare enthusiasm, progress, deep plowing, dense plowing, quantity, and quality. Now, more than five million mu of early rice fields throughout the district have been universally plowed and harrowed twice, and the mud is thoroughly worked. The broad masses of commune members in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture braved the rain on the 11th alone to launch a surprise plowing of more than 90,000 mu of early rice fields, applying sufficient base fertilizer in layers in conjunction with plowing.

Various localities have further strengthened the work of protecting and caring for draught cattle. Recently, Xiangtan Special District has allocated 6,185 dan of cottonseed cake, more than 370,000 jin of salt, and a portion of grain to feed the cattle. The entire district has also organized a large number of veterinarians to go to the countryside to make rounds treating sick draught cattle. Now, all 5,566 sick cattle in the district have been cured and strengthened, and have been put into spring plowing production.

During spring plowing, the province promoted more than 430,000 pieces of plowing tools such as rope-pulled machines, deep plows, and improved harrows, greatly improving work efficiency and accelerating the progress of plowing and field preparation. The Zhimumu Mountain People's Commune in Shaoyang County promoted more than 30 rope-pulled machines for plowing, saving 531 draught cattle and more than 2,500 laborers, and plowing deeper and faster. Now, more than 10,000 mu of early rice fields in the entire commune have been plowed and harrowed four times, just waiting for the season to transplant the seedlings.

    保证早稻适时插秧
    湖南农民提早深翻水田
    新华社长沙26日电　湖南省上千万农民投入了以翻耕水田为中心的春耕生产运动。从洞庭湖滨到五岭山麓，从早到晚，田野里人声鼎沸，处处是运肥、翻耕和搭田埂的人群。全省能够翻耕的水田，约有80％以上已经犁耙一两遍，约有20％的早稻田已整得田平泥烂、水波荡漾，只待插秧。
    根据历年丰产经验，早稻宜插嫩壮秧，秧龄二十五天左右，就要插到本田里去。为了不让“秧等田”，今年湖南各级党委在发动群众做好播种育秧工作的同时，就领导人民公社全面安排农活，及早开展了春耕翻田运动。湘潭专区组织三十二万多人和三十一万多头耕牛，成立翻耕专业队，开展了比干劲看进度、比深耕看密犁、比数量看质量的竞赛运动，现在全区五百多万亩早稻田已普遍犁耙两遍，泥浆都整活了。湘西土家族苗族自治州广大社员，在11日一天就冒雨突击翻耕早稻田九万多亩，结合翻耕分层施足了基肥。
    各地都进一步加强了耕牛护养工作。最近湘潭专区已拨出棉饼六千一百八十五担、食盐三十七万多斤和一部分粮食给牛吃。全区还组织大批兽医人员下乡巡回治疗有病的耕牛。现在，全区五千五百六十六头病牛也已治好养壮，投入了春耕生产。
    春耕中，全省推广了绳索牵引机、深耕犁、改良耙磙等翻耕工具四十三万多件，大大提高了工效，加速了翻耕整田的进度。邵阳县梽木山人民公社推广三十多部绳索牵引机犁田，节省耕牛五百三十一头、劳力二千五百多个，而且耕得深，进度快。现在，全公社一万多亩早稻田已犁耙了四遍，只等待季节插秧了。
