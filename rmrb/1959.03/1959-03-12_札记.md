    Jottings
    Lessons from the Past
    On March 10, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Roy Welensky, delivered a speech defending the crime of armed suppression of African people. He stated plausibly, "If it weren't for bullets and bayonets, Hitler would be the master of the free world today."
    It seems that this white colonist has learned the lesson that one must worship bayonets and bullets from the fact that Hitler was ultimately destroyed. However, it is laughable that he obviously did not consider that Hitler, who tried his best to "become the master of the free world," built his confidence precisely on bayonets and bullets. Yet, as Welensky knows very well, Hitler did not succeed in "becoming the master of the free world." On the contrary, "he who plays with the knife will eventually die by the knife."
    Therefore, this colonist, who uses Hitler's end as a reason to worship bayonets and bullets, should take Hitler as a lesson.
    The Master Orders a Play
    Not long ago, the Pakistani government issued an order to "halt the industrialization movement." The "New York Times," the mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, cheered loudly and clamored for "many areas of American concern" to "should" also "make changes" based on Pakistan's "good example."
    This is truly as the saying goes, the master has money and can order plays at will. Once caught in the ropes of "American aid," the hope of industrialization vanishes. However, the "New York Times" needs to clamor so loudly, obviously because "many areas" do not feel they "should" "make changes." Pakistan's "Today's News" and other important newspapers indignantly stated: "Regardless of the opinions of American advisors, due to our situation and needs, we should accelerate industrial development."

    札记
    前车可鉴
    3月10日，罗德西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦总理韦伦斯基发表演说，为武装镇压非洲人民的罪行辩护。他振振有辞地说：“要不是借助于子弹和刺刀，希特勒今天将成为自由世界的主人”。
    看来，这位白种殖民者似乎是从希特勒终于复灭的事实中，得出了必须崇拜刺刀和子弹的教训。但是，可笑的是，他显然没有想到那个竭力要使自己
  “成为自由世界的主人”的希特勒，却正是把自己的信心建立在刺刀和子弹上的。然而，正如韦伦斯基所熟知的，希特勒并没有能够使自己“成为自由世界的主人”，相反的，“玩刀者终于死于刀下”。
    所以，以希特勒的下场作为崇拜刺刀和子弹的理由的这位殖民者，却正应该以希特勒作为自己的借鉴。
    老爷点戏
    不久以前，巴基斯坦政府下了一道“停止工业化运动”的命令。美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”大为喝采，并且大声疾呼地要“美国人所关注的许多地区”也“应当”根据巴基斯坦这个“良好实例”“作出改变”。
    这真是俗话所说，老爷有钱，可以随便点戏。一旦被套上了“美援”的绳索，工业化的指望就得化为泡影了。但是，“纽约时报”需要如此大声疾呼，显然因为“许多地区”并不觉得“应当”“作出改变”。巴基斯坦的“今天报”和其他一些重要报纸就愤慨地表示：“不论美国顾问的意见如何，由于我们的情况和需要，应当加速发展工业”。
