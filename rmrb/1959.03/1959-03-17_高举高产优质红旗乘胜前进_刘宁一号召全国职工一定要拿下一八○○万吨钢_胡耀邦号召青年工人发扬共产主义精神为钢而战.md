Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech at the National Steel Workers' High-Yield and High-Quality Competition Radio Conference that all workers on the steel front created a miracle in 1958, victoriously completing the arduous task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel ahead of schedule. This is a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, a victory for the people of the whole country, and another piece of good news in the development of the world situation, where the East Wind further prevails over the West Wind. The current task is to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of this victory.

Liu Ningyi said that the task for steel workers nationwide this year is to secure 18 million tons of steel. This is a glorious task, and at the same time, an arduous task. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, with the support of the workers and people of the whole country, and with the efforts of all workers in the metallurgical industry, any difficulties can be overcome. This glorious and arduous task will certainly be completed victoriously and will be overfulfilled.

Liu Ningyi said that in the intense battle to complete 18 million tons of steel, many steel bases have already launched a vigorous mass movement, carried out a socialist competition centered on technological revolution, and are advancing victoriously, holding high the red banner of high yield and high quality. Many factories and mines have overfulfilled their production plans for January and February; many steel base workers have put forward resounding battle slogans in the competition. Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel) proposed "High yield, high quality, and multiple varieties"; workers at Baotou Steel proposed "Produce steel, iron, and steel products this year"; workers at Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel proposed "Achieve a comprehensive leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, breaking through the six major barriers of technology, transportation, materials, equipment, labor force, and safety, and doubling all indicators." In other areas, workers in the iron, steel products, ore, coke, and refractory materials departments, which are closely related to the completion of steel production targets, have also resolutely put forward strong guarantees. At the same time, an inter-factory competition to learn from, compare with, and catch up with the advanced has also begun. For example, the workers of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant proposed that the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace should be 2.3. After discussing technical measures, the workers of No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant wanted to exceed No. 1 Plant. After the workers of No. 1 Plant learned of this news, they revised the index to 2.4. According to the new technical measures, the workers of No. 2 Plant raised the index to 2.43. The workers of No. 1 Plant are now studying new measures to strive to maintain the highest record in the country. This revolutionary spirit demonstrates the heroic spirit of the steel fighters and reveals their full confidence and strong will to secure 18 million tons of steel. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions firmly believes that all comrades on the steel front across the country will be able to enthusiastically respond to the call of the conference, take immediate action, and, with great enthusiasm, launch a larger-scale socialist competition for high yield and high quality to secure 18 million tons of steel.

Liu Ningyi pointed out that the prerequisite for the competition is to first and foremost ensure the completion of various indicators of the state plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. Only in this way can the task of completing 18 million tons of steel be fundamentally guaranteed. High yield means ensuring quantity, not a single pound less; high quality means ensuring quality, requiring good steel. To have good steel, we must have good iron and good coke. In the socialist competition for high yield and high quality, we hope that you will give full play to your infinite creativity and wisdom, and make a great technological revolution around the key points in production. Everyone should use their brains, everyone should offer suggestions, continue to liberate their thinking, oppose conservatism, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and strive to improve operating methods, improve equipment and tools, reduce heavy physical labor, and ensure production safety. We must rely on our own efforts to create indigenous machinery, tap production capacity, save raw materials, and find substitute materials. We must abide by operating procedures, technical standards, and inspection systems to improve product quality, improve the quality of capital construction projects, and improve labor productivity. As everyone knows, advanced thinking leads to advanced indicators, and achieving advanced indicators requires advanced measures. Therefore, as long as we work hard to implement the above-mentioned measures and requirements, we will have a reliable guarantee for completing the task of 18 million tons of steel.

Liu Ningyi emphasized that in the socialist competition for high yield and high quality, veteran workers are the backbone of production and should enthusiastically help new workers learn technology and improve their skills. Within enterprises, all employees should closely unite and strengthen cooperation and coordination between various processes and sections to create favorable conditions for each other and comprehensively and victoriously complete the state plan. Between factories, we must widely carry out inter-factory competitions and competitions in the same trades, continuously learn from, compare with, and catch up with the advanced, exchange advanced experiences, and support each other to help overcome difficulties in production. In the high-yield and high-quality competition, we must especially establish the concept of the overall situation, conscientiously implement the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard, and strengthen communist collaboration between the steel, steel products, ore, coke, and refractory materials departments, as well as between various industrial departments. We must actively support key construction projects, earnestly fulfill ordering contracts, and achieve allocation tasks in terms of quantity, quality, and time, to jointly strive for a greater harvest in steel production in 1959.

Liu Ningyi concluded by saying that trade union workers should, under the leadership of the Party, go deep into the masses, go deep into production, actively participate in the high-yield and high-quality socialist competition on the steel front, conduct in-depth organizational work and ideological work; continuously grasp typical examples, summarize advanced experiences, promote advanced experiences, and widely carry out production propaganda and mobilization work to encourage the vast number of workers to exert greater effort and continuously push the competition to new heights.

According to Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, called on all members of the Communist Youth League and young workers on the steel front at the Steel High-Yield and High-Quality Competition Radio Conference to enthusiastically respond to the call of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Minister Wang Heshou and actively strive to make contributions to the motherland in the Steel High-Yield and High-Quality Competition.

Hu Yaobang said: Our motherland needs more and better steel, and needs more and better varieties of steel products. With these, we can build more factories and railways, and drive the overall leap forward of other industries; we can arm agriculture in advance and realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture. Hu Yaobang continued: Why should mastering technology be regarded as the first requirement for you? Because the technology of the steel industry is extremely complex: technology is needed to mine more ore. Technology is needed to refine good coke. Technology is needed to have a high blast furnace utilization coefficient. Technology is even more needed to produce various types of steel and roll various high-quality steel products. Young workers account for a large number in the steel industry. If we universally master technology skillfully, then we can work with adult and elderly workers to jointly promote the continuous development of the high-yield and high-quality movement. Therefore, quickly mastering basic operations skillfully and striving to master advanced technology has become the most important thing for our young workers. Technology is not mysterious, and it can be fully learned as long as you work hard.

Hu Yaobang said: Why do we hope that you will further promote a high degree of unity, fraternity, and communist cooperation? Because industrial production is closely linked and interconnected. For example, many steel mills are now waiting for the ironmaking departments to give them more pig iron for steelmaking, and many ironmaking departments are waiting for the coking departments to give them more and better coke. A weak link will affect other links; if some people do not complete their production tasks well, it will affect the completion of the entire production task. Our high-yield and high-quality competition requires achieving the goal of common improvement and comprehensive leap forward. This requires mutual support and large-scale collaboration between our comrades, between classes, between workshops, and between factories. If a comrade falls behind, we will enthusiastically help him; if a comrade's technology is relatively poor, we will unreservedly teach him; if someone is more advanced than me, I will humbly learn from him; if someone needs something for the overall situation, we will happily go to support him. The reason why our revolutionary cause can be victorious is because our goals are the same and we are united as one. I hope that young workers will hold up the red banner of unity, fraternity, and collaboration even higher in the high-yield and high-quality competition.

Hu Yaobang said: Why do we hope that you will overcome all difficulties with soaring enthusiasm and tenacious dedication? Because achieving the goal of high-yield and high-quality steel will inevitably encounter many specific difficulties. However, difficulties are no longer unfamiliar to us. Last year's great leap forward in our country and the multiple increase in steel production were also achieved after overcoming a series of difficulties. Therefore, as long as we continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to undertake difficulties and actively overcome difficulties, the various difficulties facing us can be overcome by finding solutions. If there are no foreign machines, we will first engage in indigenous machinery. If we can solve it ourselves, we will never rely on others. When we encounter new problems, we will hold Zhuge Liang meetings, where everyone contributes ideas and everyone offers suggestions. Our young comrades must also have this revolutionary enthusiasm, rushing to where the task is difficult; marching to where the task is urgent.

Hu Yaobang concluded by saying: Last year, our country's steel production leaped from 5.35 million tons to more than 11 million tons, covering the road that Britain took more than 30 years to travel in one year. The people of the whole country are delighted and encouraged by this huge contribution you have made to the motherland. This year, if we leap from 11 million tons to 18 million tons, then you will have made new contributions to the motherland. Dear comrades, I sincerely congratulate you on your efforts to move forward! (Attached picture)

    高举高产优质红旗乘胜前进
    刘宁一号召全国职工一定要拿下一八○○万吨钢  胡耀邦号召青年工人发扬共产主义精神为钢而战
    新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会上的讲话中指出，钢铁战线上的全体职工在1958年创造了奇迹，胜利地提前完成了一千零七十万吨钢的艰巨任务。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，全国人民的胜利，也是世界形势发展中东风更加压倒西风的又一个捷报。现在的任务就是要在这一胜利的基础上争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    刘宁一说，全国钢铁职工今年的任务是，要把一千八百万吨钢拿到手。这是一个光荣的任务，同时，也是一个艰巨的任务。我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国职工和人民的支援下，在冶金工业全体职工的努力下，任何困难都是可以克服的。这个光荣的、艰巨的任务，一定能够胜利完成并且将超额完成。
    刘宁一说，在为完成一千八百万吨钢而进行的紧张战斗中，目前许多钢铁基地已经掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，开展了以技术革命为中心的社会主义竞赛，高举着高产优质的红旗乘胜前进。许多厂矿已经超额完成了1、2月份的生产计划；许多钢铁基地的职工同志，在竞赛中提出了响亮的战斗口号。鞍钢的职工提出“高产、优质、多品种”；包钢的职工提出“今年出钢、出铁、出钢材”；石钢的职工提出“多快好省，全面大跃进，突破技术、运输、材料、设备、劳动力、安全六大关，各项指标都要翻一番”。在其他方面，和完成钢产量指标密切关联的铁、钢材、矿石、焦炭、耐火材料部门的职工同志们也都坚决提出了有力的保证。同时，一个学先进、比先进、赶先进的厂际竞赛也展开了。例如本溪第一钢铁厂职工提出高炉利用系数指标是二点三，第二钢铁厂职工讨论了技术措施后，要超过一厂；一厂的职工知道这个消息后，又把指标修订为二点四。二厂的职工根据新的技术措施又把指标提高到二点四三，一厂的职工现正在研究新的措施，争取保持全国最高纪录。这种革命干劲，表现了钢铁战士们的英雄气概，表露出钢铁战士们对拿到一千八百万吨钢具有的充分信心和刚强意志。中华全国总工会坚信，我们全国钢铁战线上的全体同志们定能一致热烈响应大会的号召，立刻行动起来，鼓足干劲，为拿到一千八百万吨钢掀起一个更大规模的高产、优质的社会主义竞赛。
    刘宁一指出，竞赛的前提，是首先切实保证按日、按旬、按月地完成国家计划的各项指标，只有这样，才能从根本上保证一千八百万吨钢的任务胜利完成。高产就是要保证数量，一斤也不少；优质就是要保证质量，要好钢。要有好钢，就要有好铁、好焦炭。在高产优质的社会主义竞赛中，希望你们发挥出无穷的创造和智慧，围绕生产中的关键大闹技术革命。要人人开动脑筋，个个献计献策，继续解放思想，反对保守，敢想、敢说、敢干，努力改进操作方法，改进设备工具，减轻笨重体力劳动，保证生产安全；要自力更生创造土机械、挖掘生产能力，节约原材料和寻找代用材料；要遵守操作规程、技术标准和检验制度，提高产品质量，提高基本建设工程质量，提高劳动生产率。大家知道，有了先进思想，才有先进指标，实现先进的指标还必须有先进措施，因此，只要我们努力地贯彻上述一些措施要求，完成一千八百万吨钢的任务就有了可靠的保证。
    刘宁一强调指出，在高产优质的社会主义竞赛中，老工人是生产中的骨干，要热情地帮助新工人学习技术，提高技术。在企业内部，全厂职工密切团结，要在各工序和工段之间，加强协作配合，互为创造有利条件，全面地胜利地完成国家计划。在各工厂之间，要广泛地开展厂际竞赛、同工种竞赛，不断地学先进、比先进、赶先进，交流先进经验，互相支援，帮助克服生产中的困难。在高产优质的竞赛中，特别要树立整体思想，认真贯彻全国一盘棋的精神，钢铁、钢材、矿石、焦炭、耐火材料部门之间，以及和各工业部门之间，都要加强共产主义大协作，积极支援重点建设，切实履行订货合同，按量、按质、按时实现调拨任务，为争取1959年钢产量的更大丰收而共同奋斗。
    刘宁一最后说，工会工作者应当在党的领导下，深入群众，深入生产，积极地投入到钢铁战线上的高产优质的社会主义竞赛中去，进行深入的组织工作和思想工作；不断地抓典型，总结先进经验，推广先进经验，广泛开展生产宣传鼓动工作，鼓舞广大职工拿出更大的干劲，把竞赛不断推向新的高潮。
    据新华社16日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦，在钢铁高产优质竞赛广播大会上，号召钢铁战线上的全体共青团员和青年职工，热烈地响应李富春副总理和王鹤寿部长的号召，积极争取在钢铁高产优质竞赛中为祖国立功。
    胡耀邦说：我们的祖国，需要更多更好的钢铁，需要有更多更好的各种品种的钢材。有了这些，我们就可以建设更多的工厂和铁路，带动其他工业全面跃进；就可以提前武装农业，实现农业的机械化和电气化。胡耀邦接着说：为什么要把掌握技术看作是对你们的第一个要求呢？因为钢铁工业的技术是极其复杂的：要矿石采得多，需要技术。要焦炭炼得好，需要技术。要炉子利用系数高，需要技术。要炼出各种品种的钢和轧成各种优质的钢材，更需要技术。我们青年工人在钢铁工业中占着很大的数量，如果我们普遍熟练地掌握了技术，那末，我们就可以同成年、老年工人一起，共同地促进高产优质运动不断地向前发展。因此，尽快地熟练基本操作，努力掌握先进技术，就成为我们青年工人头等重要的事情。技术并不神秘，只要刻苦努力，是完全可以学会的。
    胡耀邦说：为什么希望你们更大地发扬高度的团结友爱和共产主义的协作精神呢？因为工业生产是密切联系、互相关连的。例如现在许多炼钢厂就等着炼铁部门给它更多的炼钢生铁，许多炼铁部门正等着炼焦部门给它更多更好的焦炭。一个环节薄弱，就要影响其他的环节；一部分人生产任务完成不好，就要影响整个生产任务的完成。我们的高产优质竞赛，就是要求达到共同提高、全面跃进的目的。这就需要在我们的同志与同志之间，班与班之间，车间与车间之间，厂与厂之间，互相支援，大搞协作。那个同志落后了，我们就热情地帮助他；那个同志的技术比较差，我们就无保留地教给他；谁要是比我先进，我就虚心地向他学习；谁要是为了全局有所需要，我们就高高兴兴地去支援。我们的革命事业之所以能够胜利，就是因为我们的目标一致，万众一心。我希望青年职工同志们在高产优质竞赛中，更高地举起团结、友爱、协作的红旗。
    胡耀邦说：为什么希望你们用冲天的干劲和顽强的钻劲去克服一切困难呢？因为达到钢铁高产优质的目的，一定会碰到许许多多的具体困难。但是，困难对于我们来说，早已不是什么生疏的东西了。去年我们国家的大跃进和钢铁产量的成倍增长，也是在战胜了一系列的困难之后才取得的。因此，只要我们继续发扬勇于承担困难，积极战胜困难的精神，摆在我们面前的各种困难，都是有办法克服的。没有洋机器，就先搞土机械。能够自己动手解决的，就决不依赖别人。遇到新问题，就开诸葛亮会议，人人献计，个个献策。我们青年同志还要有这样的革命劲头，那里任务艰巨，就向那里突击；那里任务紧急，就向那里进军。
    胡耀邦最后说：去年我国的钢产量，从五百三十五万吨跃进到一千一百多万吨，一年走了英国三十多年走的路。全国人民对于你们为祖国所作出的这个巨大贡献，感到欢欣鼓舞。今年，我们再从一千一百万吨跃进到一千八百万吨，那你们就又为祖国立下了新的功勋。亲爱的同志们，我衷心地祝贺你们努力前进！（附图片）
