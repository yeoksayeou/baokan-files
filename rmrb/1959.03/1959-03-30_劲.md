    Strength

    Strength is the ability and quantity of physical and mental power exerted on a certain matter through labor. Without strength, people cannot survive and grow.

    Strength is also a material force, but it is not a static number, nor is it something that remains at a certain level forever unchanged. It is expressed and increased through competition with objective things. People who constantly push carts have strong leg strength, people who constantly carry loads have strong shoulder strength, the more the brain is used, the smarter it becomes, and heroes emerge from labor. Without exerting strength, without struggle, you cannot subdue your work object, and your strength will not grow. People who are stingy with their strength will become weaker and weaker; intellectual slackers will become more and more foolish. People with a strong revolutionary cause will have greater revolutionary drive; the appendix does not work or play a role, and it will become more and more degenerate.

    How much strength is there? The standard should be measured by the results of the work. The so-called potential is infinite, and strength is also a constantly changing material force that can be continuously increased. Being unable to lift a "thousand-jin stone" right now, with a few practices, seven or eight practices, it may be possible to lift it. Being unable to penetrate a certain problem today, with a few drills, seven or eight drills, it may be possible to penetrate it. Strength is changing, so if today the drive is sufficient, but with the development of the leap forward situation, if the strength still remains at the original level, it may be relatively insufficient. Therefore, strength can be encouraged, not discouraged.

    Strength is a manifestation of struggle, that is, revolutionary will. People with strong revolutionary enthusiasm will inevitably be full of drive. Slackening emotions are actually a wavering of revolutionary will in a certain period of time, under certain conditions, and on a certain issue.

    Doctors know the "acupoints" before administering acupuncture. If the wrong "acupoint" is pricked, the condition may worsen, or even be life-threatening; if the needle is pricked on the bone, the needle may even break; this is not just a problem of not being able to use strength. Using steel on the edge of a knife, so skillful work is very important. Practice makes perfect. "Familiar" has two meanings, one is to be familiar with the laws of things, to know the performance of the work object, to recognize the grain of the wood when splitting wood; the other is to master the skills in the work and use them freely. Familiarity and skill both come from doing. Hard work is a sign of using strength; skillful work is the direction of using strength.

    劲
    梢舟
    劲，是体力和脑力通过劳动，作用于一定事物表现出来的能和量。人没有劲，就不能生存和生长。
    劲也是物质力量，但它不是一个死的数目字，不是停留在一个水平上永远不变的东西。它是在和客观事物较量中表现出来和增长起来的。常推车的人腿劲大，常挑担的人肩劲大，脑子越用越聪明，劳动里边出英雄。不用劲，不斗争，就降服不了你的工作对象，你的劲也不好增长。惜力的人，身体会越来越弱；思想懒汉，就会越来越愚笨。革命事业心强的人，革命干劲越大；盲肠不劳动，不起作用，就越来越退化。
    劲有多大？标准应该用工作结果来衡量。所谓潜力无穷，劲也是不断变化着的物质力量，可以不断地增长。目下拿不动“千斤石”，练上几练，七练八练，就可能拿动。今天钻不透某一个问题，钻上几钻，七钻八钻，就可能钻透。劲在变化着，所以今天干劲足了，随着跃进形势的发展，劲若仍停留在原有水平上，就可能是相对的不足。因此，劲可鼓，不可泄。
    劲是斗争性，也就是革命意志的表现。革命热情旺盛的人，必然干劲经常十足。松劲情绪，实际上是革命意志在一定时间内、一定条件下、一定问题上的动摇。
    医生扎针，首先懂得“穴道”。如果扎错了“穴”，病情可能加重，甚至有致命危险；如果针扎到骨头上，还可能折针；这不光是个有劲使不上的问题。把钢使在刀刃上，所以巧干很要紧。熟能生巧。熟有两个意思，一是熟悉事物的规律，知道工作对象的性能，劈木识纹道；一是工作中掌握技巧，运用自如。熟也好，巧也好，都是从干中来的。苦干，是用劲的标志；巧干，是用劲的方向。
