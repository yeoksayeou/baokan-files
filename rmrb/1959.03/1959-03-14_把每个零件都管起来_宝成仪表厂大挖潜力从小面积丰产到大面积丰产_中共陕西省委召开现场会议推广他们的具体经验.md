    Managing Every Part
    Bao Cheng Instrument Factory Explores Potential, Moving from Small-Area High Yield to Large-Area High Yield; Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Holds On-Site Meeting to Promote Their Specific Experience
    Xi'an, March 13th (From Our Own Correspondent) - The state-owned Bao Cheng Instrument Factory is currently engaged in a large-scale industrial potential-tapping campaign. In this movement, mass discussions of plans and technical innovation movements are closely integrated. All parts are studied and discussed individually, specific measures are found, and leap forward plans for the first quarter and the whole year are formulated. At the same time, these measures are immediately applied to production.
    This factory's approach quickly produced good results in production. In January, it overfulfilled the total output value plan by 50% and the commodity output value plan by 30%. The commodity output value increased thirteen times compared with the same period last year. In February, it overfulfilled the total output value plan by 20% and the commodity output value plan by 13.3%. The total output value and commodity output value completed in February increased by more than 40% compared with January.
    In December last year, based on the needs of national production and construction, this factory put forward a preliminary plan: in 1959, the commodity output value should be ten times that of 1958, and new products should be increased threefold. Afterwards, it launched the masses of workers to conduct discussions.
    The factory's Party Committee Secretary and Factory Director chose Cui Jingyan's group in the first workshop as their experimental field. This is a precision parts processing group, responsible for processing all precision parts in the first workshop. Its characteristics are many product varieties, high precision, and two-thirds or more of the group are apprentices, with an average worker grade of only 0.71. Therefore, if the great leap forward problem of this group is solved, the problems of other groups will be easily solved. Leading cadres first helped this group formulate a shift production leap forward target equal to ten times the actual production level of last year. Then, leading cadres, technical personnel, and group workers jointly discussed leap forward measures. Their approach was to put forward the drawings and real objects of the 144 parts produced by the whole group and start with the key parts, discussing them "one by one" until they passed. During the discussion, some designs were modified, some process regulations were modified, some equipment and tools were improved, and some materials of the parts were changed, all under the premise of ensuring product quality and specifications. They also experimented while discussing. Each part was innovated technologically in this way until it reached or exceeded the shift production leap forward target. For example, the copper pipe on the instrument, which was originally processed by Master Xu Guoliang, needed to be bored and then polished, and only twenty pieces could be produced per shift. At the group meeting, Xu Guoliang and technician Qi Yongquan jointly studied and modified the design, reducing the boring process, and the shift production could reach two hundred pieces. Another example is a gear part with a shaft, which could only produce thirty pieces per shift in the past. After changing the process route, it could produce fifty to sixty pieces per shift. After more than ten discussions, more than 95% of the parts in the group passed the "test". Every worker in the group was very familiar with the design structure, purpose, importance, processing method, shift production target, annual task, etc. of the parts.
    The factory Party committee promptly summarized the experience of Cui Jingyan's group in closely integrating plan discussion with technical innovation, and believed that this approach was completely in line with the spirit of making economic work more and more detailed proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. It decided to immediately promote it throughout the factory, launching a factory-wide industrial potential-tapping movement to ensure that large-scale high yield is achieved in the struggle for a greater leap forward.
    The "digging potential" movement combining the discussion of plans with vigorous technical revolution has given thousands of workers and staff of the Bao Cheng Instrument Factory greater courage and strength for a greater leap forward from learning the experience of Cui Jingyan's group. They not only learned the experience of Cui Jingyan's group, but also enriched this experience with rich wisdom. For example, the second workshop not only adopted the "three-in-one combination" method to discuss plans, but also used this method to realize the plans. In order to realize the leap forward plan with the "three-in-one combination" method, they appropriately adjusted the workshop's organizational structure, and transferred all staff members such as designers, process engineers, planners, and technicians to the production groups, directly under the leadership of the production group leaders, and participated in production labor and technical innovation research with the workers in the identity of workers; the workshop director, deputy director, and branch secretary were also assigned to each production group to participate in production on the one hand, and to help the group do organizational work on the other hand. In this way, workers, technicians, and leading cadres are combined together, everyone prepares for production, everyone does technical work, and everyone participates in management work and actual operation, which greatly improves production efficiency and product quality, ensures the rapid realization of the "parts pass the test" measures, and also greatly shortens the trial production time of new products. Recently, the workshop accepted a new product trial production task. After the part drawings were sent to the group, more than 20 workers and technicians studied them together, and compiled 52 process regulations in three hours, and the quality of the compilation was very good.
    During the potential-tapping movement, all workshops in the factory universally held "parts pass the test" exhibitions. At the meeting, each group exhibited the shift production targets, part items, passed parts, failed parts, measures taken to pass the parts, etc., to complete the leap forward plan. Leading cadres and all staff members can see at any time from the exhibition how many parts in each workshop or group have passed the test or have not passed the test, prompting staff members to carry out technical innovation on parts that have not reached the shift production target. Many key production problems that could not be solved that day were solved the next day; parts that did not reach the shift production target in the morning broke through the target in the afternoon.
    At present, the entire factory is continuing to break through key points and strive to formulate and implement leap forward measures for 100% of the parts by carrying out the red banner worker movement. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting at this factory from March 3rd to 5th to promote their experience.

    把每个零件都管起来
    宝成仪表厂大挖潜力从小面积丰产到大面积丰产  中共陕西省委召开现场会议推广他们的具体经验
    本报西安13日电　国营宝成仪表厂正在开展一个大规模的工业挖潜力运动。在这个运动中群众性的讨论计划和技术革新运动密切结合在一起，对所有零件逐个进行研究讨论，找到具体措施，制定一季度和全年的跃进计划，同时马上把这些措施运用到生产上。
    这个厂的这种作法，很快在生产上产生了好的效果。1月份超额50％完成总产值计划，超额30％完成商品产值计划，商品产值比去年同时期增长了十三倍；2月份超额20％完成了总产值计划，超额13.3％完成商品产值计划，2月份完成的总产值和商品产值比1月份提高40％以上。
    去年12月份，这个厂根据国家生产建设的需要，提出初步计划：1959年商品产值要等于1958年的十倍，新产品增加三倍，以后就发动职工群众进行讨论。
    这个厂的中共党委书记和厂长选择了第一车间崔景岩组作为他们的试验田。这是一个精密零件加工组，负责加工一车间全部精密零件。其特点是产品品种多，精密度高，全组三分之二以上的人又是徒工，工人平均等级只有零点七一级。因此，如果解决了这个组的大跃进问题，其他组的问题就会迎刃而解。领导干部首先帮助这个组制定了等于去年实际生产水平十倍的班产跃进指标。然后，领导干部、技术人员和小组工人共同讨论跃进措施。他们的作法是把全组生产的一百四十四个零件的图纸和实物都提出来，首先从关键零件开始，一个一个的讨论“过关”。讨论中在保证产品质量规格前提下，有的修改了设计，有的修改了工艺规程，有的改进了设备和工具，也有的改变了零件的材料。他们还一边讨论一边试验。每个零件都是这样通过搞技术革新，直到达到或超过班产跃进指标为止。例如徐国梁老师傅负责加工的仪表上的铜管，原来需要镗空后再抛光，每班只能产二十个。在小组会上徐国梁和技术员齐永泉等共同研究修改了设计，减少了镗空工序，班产能够达到二百个。又如一种带轴的齿轮零件，过去每班只能生产三十个，改变了工艺路线后，每班能生产五十个至六十个。这样经过十多次讨论，全组95％以上的零件都过了“关”；全组每个工人对零件的设计结构、用途、重要性、加工方法以及每人的班产指标、全年任务等等，都非常熟悉。
    工厂党委及时总结了崔景岩小组讨论计划同技术革新密切结合的经验，认为这种做法完全符合党六中全会提出的经济工作越作越细的精神，决定马上在全厂推广，掀起一个全厂工业上挖潜力的运动，保证在争取更大跃进中达到大面积丰产。
    结合讨论计划大搞技术革命的“挖掘潜力”运动，宝成仪表厂数千职工都从学习崔景岩小组经验中得到了更大跃进的勇气和力量。他们不仅学习了崔景岩小组的经验，还用丰富的智慧充实了这个经验。例如二车间不仅采用“三结合”的办法讨论计划，还用这个办法来实现计划。为了用“三结合”的办法实现跃进计划，他们适当调整了车间组织机构，将设计员、工艺员、计划员、技术员等全部职员下放到生产小组去，直接受生产小组长的领导，以工人身份和工人一起参加生产劳动和技术革新的研究工作；车间主任、副主任和支部书记也分工到各生产组去，一方面参加生产，一方面帮助小组做组织工作。这样，工人、技术员和领导干部结合在一起，人人做生产准备工作，人人做技术工作，人人参加管理工作和实际操作，大大提高了生产效率和产品质量，保证了“零件过关”措施的迅速实现，也大大缩短了新产品的试制时间。最近该车间接受一个新产品试制任务，把零件图纸发到小组后，二十多个工人和技术人员一起研究，三个小时就编出五十二份工艺规程，而且编的质量很好。
    全厂各车间在挖潜力运动中，普遍举办了“零件过关”展览会。会上各小组都把自己完成跃进计划的班产指标、零件项目以及过了关的零件实物、没有过关的零件实物、零件过关所采取的措施等等，都展览出来。领导干部和全体职工从展览会上随时可以看到每个车间或小组有多少零件过关或者没有过关，促使职工对没有达到班产指标的零件进行技术革新。很多当天还没法解决的生产关键问题。第二天就解决了；上午还达不到班产指标的零件，下午就被突破了指标。
    目前，全厂正在通过开展红旗手运动，继续突破关键，力争百分之百地零件都订出并实现跃进措施。中共陕西省委已在3月3日到5日在这个厂召开现场会议，推广他们的经验。
