    Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian Seize the Management of Tea Gardens
    Sichuan's Ya'an Tea Production Advances Victoriously
    (Our dispatch) In order to strive for a greater bumper harvest in tea production this year, many tea-producing areas in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian have been focusing on winter fertilization and frost prevention of tea gardens since the end of tea picking and processing last autumn and winter, and have achieved great results. In Anhui Province's key tea-producing area, Wuhu Prefecture, as of now, the area of winter plowing in tea gardens has reached more than 269,000 mu, accounting for 84.3% of the tea garden area; more than 265,000 mu have been earthed up, accounting for 83.1%; and more than 253,000 mu have been fertilized, with a total application of more than 437,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, 2.04 million dan of local fertilizer, and more than 48 million dan of farm manure. The amount of fertilizer applied to tea gardens has greatly exceeded that of last year. The frost prevention work in Zhejiang Province's tea gardens has been better and more widespread this year than last year. According to statistics from 24 counties, the area that has been prepared for frost prevention is 217,000 mu, accounting for more than 80% of the area that should be protected, more than double that of the same period last year. Shaoxing County in this province has done a very good job in applying winter fertilizer and preventing frost in tea gardens. 72% of the county's tea gardens have been fertilized once with winter fertilizer, with an average application of 55 dan of standard fertilizer per mu. Tea trees that are susceptible to frost have basically been protected. As of January 24, Anxi County in Fujian has deep-plowed more than 10,000 mu of tea gardens and fertilized 3,300 mu.
    Judging from the situation in these provinces, although great achievements have been made in the winter management of tea gardens, it is not balanced enough, and some tea-producing areas are even worse than last year. This situation has attracted the attention of various places, and measures are being taken to vigorously carry out early spring topdressing to make up for the lack of winter fertilization.
    (Our dispatch) Ya'an, a mountain city located on the edge of the Sichuan Basin and on the banks of the Qingyi River, has always been rich in border tea. Last year, while grain production increased by 70%, tea production also developed greatly. The county has transplanted more than 94.8 million tea seedlings, which can open up more than 20,000 mu of new tea gardens. At the same time, the county realized the mechanization of tea-making equipment three years ahead of schedule. At present, they are continuing to advance victoriously, ensuring that tea production doubles on the basis of last year, and seedling propagation quadruples, reaching 300 to 400 million seedlings.
    The reason why Ya'an County can become the county with the most and fastest expansion of tea gardens and development of tea production in Sichuan Province is primarily because the Party Committee has strengthened its leadership over tea production. In addition to unified arrangements and deployments for tea production, the County Party Committee has also established command headquarters, stations, and groups for the development of tea production at the county, district, and township levels respectively. The Minister of the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee and the Deputy County Head in charge of tea serve as the chief commanders, and the Party Secretaries of the districts and townships personally take charge, grasping ideology, planning, action, and both ends to drive the middle, in order to ensure the realization of the plan. In the development of tea production in the county, some people believed that the contradictions between grain and tea in terms of land, fertilizer, and labor could not be resolved, and that the development of tea could only be done on a small scale, not on a large scale, and that it could only be done slowly, not by leaping forward. In response to these ideological problems, the County Party Committee, in addition to explaining the important significance of developing tea in large and small meetings, also launched debates among Party members, cadres, and the masses, focusing on the themes of whether tea production needs to leap forward, can leap forward, and how to leap forward. Through debates, a consensus was reached. It was determined that hilly, plain, and gentle slope areas should focus on developing grain, while high mountain slopes should focus on developing tea. It is also planned that 40% of the county's land will be cultivated into contiguous tea gardens, and the goal of producing 1,000 jin per mu will be achieved by 1962. Ya'an County also adhered to the working method of planting experimental fields and holding on-site meetings in the development of tea production. The county, district, township, and commune all planted experimental fields at each level, and as soon as there was experience, it was immediately promoted in the form of on-site meetings.
    In their work, they not only worked hard and practically, but also carried forward the spirit of working skillfully, mobilizing the masses to carry out tool reforms. The people of the county worked hard for a month and reformed and popularized the edge tea rolling machine, realizing the mechanization of the initial processing of edge tea three years ahead of schedule, liberating tens of thousands of tea farmers from the heavy manual tea-making, not only increasing work efficiency by about ten times, saving more than 50,000 laborers in the county, but also improving the quality by one to two grades, increasing income for the commune by about 60,000 yuan. In order to increase tea production, they also grasped the key to increasing production by cultivating and fertilizing tea gardens and fighting against natural disasters. Originally, the tea farmers in the county had no habit of fertilizing tea trees, nor did they cultivate and weed separately, which prevented tea production from increasing rapidly. In order to change this situation, the actual effect of fertilization increasing production was used to educate and mobilize the masses through accounting and demonstration comparisons, and winter plowing and fertilization were gradually implemented. The fertilization area accounted for 70%-80% of the picking area. (Attached photo)

    安徽浙江福建抓紧管理茶园
    四川雅安茶叶生产乘胜挺进
    本报讯　为了争取今年茶叶生产更大丰收，安徽、浙江、福建许多茶区从去年秋冬茶叶采制一结束就抓紧了冬季茶园施肥和防冻，并取得很大成绩。安徽省重点茶区芜湖专区到目前止茶园冬耕面积达二十六万九千多亩，占茶园面积的84.3％；培土二十六万五千多亩，占83.1％；施肥二十五万三千多亩，共施化肥四十三万七千多斤，土化肥二百零四万担，农家肥四千八百多万担，茶园施肥量大大超过了去年。浙江省茶园防冻工作今年比去年做得好而且普遍，据二十四个县统计，已经作好防冻的面积有二十一万七千亩，占应防面积的80％以上，比去年同期扩大了一倍多。这个省绍兴县茶园施冬肥和防冻工作都作得很好，全县72％茶园已施过一次冬肥，每亩平均施标准肥五十五担。易受冻的茶树基本上都作好了防护。福建安溪县截止1月24日，茶园深耕面积达一万余亩，施肥三千三百亩。
    从这几个省的情况来看，冬季茶园管理工作虽然取得了很大成绩但还不够平衡，有些茶区甚至还不如去年。这种情况已引起各地的注意，正采取措施大抓早春追肥，以弥补冬季施肥的不足。
    本报讯　位于川西盆地边缘、青衣江畔的山城雅安，一向盛产边茶。去年在粮食增产70％的同时，茶叶生产也有很大发展。全县共扦插茶苗九千四百八十多万株，可开辟新茶园二万多亩。同时，全县提前三年实现了制茶机具化。目前，他们在继续乘胜挺进，保证茶叶产量在去年的基础上翻一番，扦插育苗翻四番，达到三至四亿株。
    雅安县能够成为四川省目前扩大茶园、发展茶叶生产最多最快的县，首先是由于党委对茶叶生产加强了领导。县委对茶叶生产除统一安排布置外，并在县、区、乡都分别成立了发展茶叶生产指挥部、站、组，县委农村工作部长和管茶叶的副县长任总指挥，区、乡由党委书记亲自挂帅，抓思想、抓规划、抓行动、抓两头带中间，以保证计划的实现。该县在发展茶叶生产中，曾有人认为粮茶争地、争肥、争劳动力的矛盾无法解决，认为发展茶叶只能小搞、不能大搞，只能慢慢来，不能跃进。县委针对这些思想问题，除在大小会议上讲明发展茶叶的重要意义外，并以茶叶需不需要跃进，能不能跃进，如何跃进为主题，在党内外、广大干部和群众中开展辩论，通过辩论，统一了认识。确定丘陵、平坝、缓坡地带，以发展粮食为主，高山陂坡地带以发展茶叶为主。并规划全县以40％土地培植成片茶园，到1962年实现亩产千斤县。雅安县在发展茶叶生产中还坚持了种试验田、开现场会的工作方法。县、区、乡、社都层层种了试验田，一有经验就立即用现场会议等形式加以推广。
    他们在工作中不但实干苦干，而且还发扬了巧干的精神，发动群众大搞工具改革。全县人民苦战一月，便改制并普及了边茶揉茶机，提前三年实现了边茶初制机具化，使几万茶农从笨重的人工制茶中解放出来，不但提高工效十倍左右，全县节约劳力五万多个，而且提高品质一至二等，为公社增加收入约六万元。为了提高茶叶产量，他们还抓住了茶园中耕施肥和向自然灾害作斗争的增产关键。原来该县茶农对茶树无施肥习惯，也不单独中耕除草，使茶叶产量不能迅速提高。为改变这种情况，通过算账和示范对比，用施肥增产的实际效果教育和发动群众，逐步实行了冬耕施肥，施肥面积占采摘面积的70％—80％。（附图片）
