    Planting Pumpkins on High Ridges and Slopes

    The pumpkin is a climbing plant with widely distributed vines. A single pumpkin plant can yield more than 300 jin (150kg) of pumpkins. Pumpkins are nutritious and can be used as a substitute for grain, made into various dishes, and processed into sugar. They are also an excellent feed for pigs. Another characteristic of pumpkins is that they can be stored for a long time; pumpkins harvested as early as May can be stored until March of the following year.

    The growth characteristics of pumpkins make them suitable for high, dry ground. Therefore, high ridges, mountain slopes, embankment walls, river beaches that are not reached by the water level, grave mounds, and other places unsuitable for planting other crops can all be used to plant pumpkins. It is recommended that all localities make use of these vacant places to plant more pumpkins.

    Planting more pumpkins can not only solve the problem of vegetable consumption but also increase the income of the communes and individual members.

    利用高埂斜坡种南瓜
    南瓜是一种攀缘植物，它的茎藤分布面大，一棵南瓜能结瓜三百斤以上。南瓜营养丰富，除能代粮之外，能做出各种菜肴，并可制糖。如果拿来喂猪，更是一种很好的饲料。南瓜还有一个特点，可以保存很长时间，早在5月里结的瓜，可以保存到明年3月。
    南瓜的生长特性，适宜于高燥的地面。因此，凡是高埂、山坡、堤岸壁、水位不到的沟滩、坟墩，以及不适宜种植其他农作物的地方，都可用来种南瓜。建议各地利用这些空闲的地方，多多种植南瓜。
    多种南瓜，不但能够解决吃菜问题，还能增加公社和社员个人的收入。
