Bolivian people, like the people of other Latin American countries, are disgusted with the American imperialists who have long exploited and controlled them.

Bolivia is the fifth largest country in Latin America, with an area of over 1.09 million square kilometers and a population of 3.3 million, more than half of whom are farmers. Bolivia is a country known for its rich mineral deposits, and its tin production is second only to Malaya in the capitalist world. Income from tin mines accounts for 80%-90% of the national income, with an average annual output of 30,000 tons. Since World War II, Bolivia's economic lifeline has been completely controlled by American monopoly capital. The three major companies controlled by American capital own almost all the tin mines. The largest trust is the Patino Mining Corporation, controlled by the Rockefeller Group, which accounts for 43% of Bolivia's total tin production and has a profit rate of as much as 42.7%. Bolivians hate the three major tin mining companies and call them "termites."

In 1952, the Bolivian people's uprising overthrew the Baivian military dictatorship and forced the new government to nationalize the tin mines, severely hitting American imperialism. However, 70% of Bolivia's tin ore still has to be shipped to the United States for smelting, and the tin market is still restricted to the dollar zone, with prices still determined by American companies. Because the United States implements a price-cutting policy, Bolivia has to lose 50 million U.S. dollars every year. For example, in 1951, one pound of tin was 1.83 U.S. dollars, but by 1958, the United States had reduced the price to 0.84 U.S. dollars, while the cost of producing one pound of tin in Bolivia was 1.24 U.S. dollars. In 1958, in order to alleviate the domestic economic crisis, the United States even stipulated through the International Tin Council—the "London Tin Council"—that Bolivia's tin production be reduced from 30,000 tons to an annual output of 18,000 tons. This has made Bolivia's economy even more difficult.

The United States is also doing everything possible to plunder Bolivia's oil wealth. It is estimated that two-thirds of Bolivia's total area has rich oil deposits, and oil production is also increasing year by year. In recent years, seven American companies have obtained oil leases for an area of 11.32 million hectares, including the "Gulf Oil Company" belonging to the Mellon Consortium, as well as "Shell Oil Exploration Company" and "Mobil Oil Company". Only 19.1% of these companies' products are handed over to Bolivia, and the rest are owned by American companies.

    美国对玻利维亚的掠夺
    玻利维亚人民同其他拉丁美洲国家人民一样，恨透了长期剥削和控制他们的美帝国主义者。
    玻利维亚是拉丁美洲的第五个大国，面积一百零九万多平方公里，人口三百三十万，过半数为农民。玻利维亚是以富于各种矿藏而闻名的国家，锡产量在资本主义世界仅次于马来亚而占第二位。锡矿的收入占国民收入的80％—90％，平均年产量达三万吨。第二次世界大战以后，玻利维亚的经济命脉已完全操纵在美国垄断资本手中。美国资本控制的三大公司几乎占有全部锡矿，最大的一个托拉斯是洛克菲勒集团控制的巴提诺矿业公司，占玻利维亚全部锡产量的43％，利润率多达42.7％。玻利维亚人对三大锡矿公司恨之入骨，把它们叫做“蛀虫”。
    1952年玻利维亚人民起义推翻了巴伊维昂军事独裁政权；并迫使新政府把锡矿国有化，沉重地打击了美帝国主义。但是玻利维亚70％的锡矿砂仍要运往美国熔炼，而且锡的市场仍被限制在美元区内，价格仍由美国大公司来决定。由于美国实行压价政策，玻利维亚不得不每年在这方面亏损五千万美元，如1951年一英磅锡是一点八三美元，到1958年已被美国把价格压到零点八四美元，而玻利维亚生产一英磅锡的成本就要一点二四美元。1958年，美国为缓和国内经济危机竟通过国际锡矿组织——“伦敦锡矿委员会”规定玻利维亚的锡矿生产从三万吨降低到年产一万八千吨。这就使玻利维亚经济更加陷于窘境。
    美国还千方百计地掠夺玻利维亚的石油财富。据估计，玻利维亚全国面积的三分之二有丰富的石油矿，石油产量也逐年在增加。近几年来，美国七个公司得到了面积为一千一百三十二万公顷的石油承租权，其中有属于梅隆财团的“海湾石油公司”以及“壳牌石油勘探公司”和“美孚油公司”。这些公司的产品只有19.1％交给玻利维亚，其余的都为美国公司所有。
