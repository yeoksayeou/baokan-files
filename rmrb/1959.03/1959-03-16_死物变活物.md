　　The warehouse is a place to store materials. It is necessary for production enterprises to store a certain amount of materials in their own warehouses, otherwise it will be difficult to maintain continuous production. However, excessive reserves, or storing materials that are not needed for the unit's production, or materials that are not currently needed, will cause backlog and waste, turning animate objects into inanimate ones.

　　Since the Great Leap Forward, although our country's material wealth has greatly increased, the growth of production needs has also been very large. In order to meet this need, in addition to the state rushing to manufacture a batch of production equipment, each unit should take stock of its resources and take out the inventory materials, which will be uniformly allocated by the production command department and used where it is most urgently needed to ensure the needs of key projects and key enterprises. This is also a way to solve the material difficulties. The facts in Gansu are a good proof.

    死物变活物
    仓库是储备物资的地方。生产企业单位在自己的仓库里储备一定数量的物资，是需要的，否则就难以保持连续性的生产。但是，储备量过大，或是储存一些非本单位生产所需要的物资，或是非目前所需要的物资，则会造成积压浪费，活物变成死物。
    大跃进以来，我们国家的物质财富虽然有了很大的增长，而生产需要量的增长也很大。为了满足这种需要，除由国家赶制一批生产设备外，各单位清点一下家底，把库存物资拿出来，由生产指挥部门统一调拨，用到当前最急需的地方去，保证重点工程和重点企业的需要，这也是解决物资困难的一个办法。甘肃的事实就是一个好证明。
