　　Small Factory, Excellent Products
　　The Red Flag Paper Mill of the Renmin University of China, using a small, indigenous-modern combined paper machine, successfully produced thin, high-grade paper – envelope paper. The successful trial production of this new product has opened up a broad road for the multi-variety production of the entire small indigenous paper mills.
　　Small indigenous paper mills, due to their poor equipment conditions, have always been considered incapable of multi-variety production. However, facts have proven that as long as the design, manufacturing, and installation are proper, and the workers are skilled in operation, indigenous-modern combined paper-making equipment, such as small paper machines with iron-wood paper machines and gas-fired drying cylinders, can keep pace with foreign paper machines of similar scale.
　　Small indigenous paper mills are powerful assistants to large foreign paper mills. Small paper mills being able to produce high-grade paper is another victory for the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" in the paper-making industry. Resolutely implementing this policy will allow the paper-making industry to leap forward even greater, better, and more comprehensively, producing more paper to meet the growing needs of the people.

    厂小产品精
    中国人民大学红旗造纸厂，用一台土洋结合的小型造纸机，成功地抄出了薄型高级纸——邮封纸。这个新产品的试制成功，为整个小型土纸厂的多品种生产拓开一条宽阔道路。
    小土纸厂由于设备条件较差，向来有人认为是不能多品种生产的。然而，事实证明：只要设计、制造、安装得当，工人操作熟练，则土洋结合的造纸设备，如像铁木纸机、煤气烘缸的小纸机与同类规模的洋纸机，是可以并驾齐驱的。
    小土纸厂是大洋纸厂的有力助手。小纸厂能生产高级纸，这是党的两条腿走路方针在造纸工业上的又一胜利。坚决地贯彻这个方针，造纸工业就可以更大、更好、更全面地向前跃进，生产更多的纸张，满足人民日益增长的需要。
