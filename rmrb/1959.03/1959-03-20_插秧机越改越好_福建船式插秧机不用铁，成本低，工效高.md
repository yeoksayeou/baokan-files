Rice Transplanters are Getting Better and Better
    Fujian Boat-Style Rice Transplanter Uses No Iron, Low Cost, High Efficiency

Fuzhou, March 19th (Reported by this newspaper) - The Fujian Provincial Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory has recently successfully modified a boat-style simple rice transplanter. After practical use in paddy fields, a skilled person can transplant two to two and a half mu of rice seedlings per day with this boat-style simple rice transplanter, achieving the requirement of dense planting at 6 × 1.5 (row spacing) cun. This is five to seven times more efficient than manual transplanting and greatly reduces the physical labor of farmers. After appraisal by the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Department, it is considered that this boat-style simple rice transplanter is the best among all transplanting tools in the province and can be manufactured and promoted on a large scale.

The boat-style simple rice transplanter consists of three parts: seedling clip, seedling box, and seedling boat. It was successfully manufactured by the staff of the Provincial Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory based on the better simple rice transplanter made in Liling, Hunan Province, after many field tests and repeated modifications. The mud-dragging board of the seedling box frame of the Hunan Liling-made rice transplanter is narrow, leaving a trench after the machine passes, and the transplanted rice seedlings easily float up. The modified rice transplanter of the Fujian Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory has corrected this shortcoming. They modified the mud-dragging board under the seedling box frame into two transplanting boats, so there is no trench left after the machine passes, making the transplanting lighter and faster. The boats can also store seedlings, solving the problem of transporting seedlings. They also nailed a row of palm strips to the lower part of the seedling box board to prevent damage to the seedling roots when clamping the seedlings. The seedling box is divided into grids with ropes, which improves the uniformity of seedling clamping. A regulating bamboo strip is also installed in the seedling clamping part, which can adjust the number of seedlings to meet various dense planting requirements. This rice transplanter is all made of wood and bamboo, without a single piece of iron. Carpenters can understand how to make it at a glance, and the cost per unit is only five or six yuan. The staff of the factory summarized the advantages of this boat-style simple rice transplanter as: high efficiency, low cost, simple manufacture, easy operation, suitable for dense planting requirements, and easy for mass promotion.

The Provincial Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory is now rushing to manufacture a batch of boat-style simple rice transplanters, preparing to distribute them to various counties, and then promote and use them on a large scale.

    插秧机越改越好
    福建船式插秧机不用铁，成本低，工效高
    本报福州19日电　福建省农具试验厂最近改制成功了一种船式简易插秧机。这种船式简易插秧机经过在水田里实地使用，一个技术熟练的人一天可以插秧二亩到二亩半，达到密植6×1.5（株行距）寸的要求，比人工插秧可提高效率五倍到七倍，而且大大减轻了农民的体力劳动。经福建省农业部门鉴定，认为这种船式简易插秧机，是目前本省所有插秧工具中较好的一种，可以大量制造、推广。
    船式简易插秧机由秧夹、秧箱、秧船三个部分组成。是省农具试验厂的职工根据全国较好的湖南省醴陵制造的简易插秧机，经过多次实地试验、反复修改之后，制造成功的。湖南醴陵制造的插秧机秧箱架的拖泥板窄，机子走后留下一条沟，插的秧容易浮起来。福建农具试验厂改制的插秧机改正了这个缺点，他们把秧箱架下的拖泥板改制成两条插秧船，机子走过再没有沟了，插起来又轻快，船上还可以储存秧苗，解决了运秧问题。他们还在秧箱板下部钉上一排棕片，使夹秧时不致碰坏秧根。秧箱用绳子分格，提高了夹秧的均匀度；还在夹秧部分装了一个调节竹片，可以调整秧苗的根数，适应各种不同的密植要求。这种插秧机全部是用木材、竹子作的，不用一块铁，木匠一看就懂得制造，每台成本只有五、六元。该厂职工综合这种船式简易插秧机的好处是：效率高，成本低，制造简便，操作容易，适应密植要求，便于大量推广。
    现在省农具试验厂正在赶制一批船式简易插秧机，准备分发到各个县，然后大量推广、使用。
