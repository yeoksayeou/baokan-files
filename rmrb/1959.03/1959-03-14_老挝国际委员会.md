    The International Commission for Laos
    Question: We are very concerned about the recent developments in Indochina and would like an introduction to the International Commission for Laos.
    Beijing Reader, Li Ming
    Answer: The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, referred to as the International Commission for Laos, was established in accordance with the Geneva Accords on Indochina signed in July 1954. The task of the International Commission for Laos is to supervise and control the implementation of the clauses of the Geneva Accords regarding the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos". The International Commission consists of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada, with the Indian representative serving as chairman.
    Since its establishment in August 1954, the International Commission for Laos has carried out considerable work and made beneficial contributions to supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the Laotian region. The smooth implementation of the ceasefire in Laos, the timely withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteer personnel and French Union forces, and especially the achievement of a peaceful and unified political agreement between the Royal Lao Government and the Pathet Lao forces, while primarily the result of the unremitting efforts of the Lao people, are also inseparable from the efforts of the International Commission for Laos. In addition, the Geneva Accords stipulate that Laos shall not participate in any military blocs, shall not provide military bases for foreign countries, shall not accept foreign military aid, and that the Lao government guarantees that all citizens can participate in national life and enjoy various rights and freedoms without any discrimination. These major measures to safeguard peace in Laos and Indochina need to be continued; the International Commission, responsible for supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords, should continue to play its role. However, due to the insistence of the Canadian commissioner and the agreement of the Indian commissioner, the International Commission for Laos, on July 19, 1958, passed a resolution to adjourn indefinitely by a majority of two votes to one (Poland).
    After the reactionary pro-American forces represented by Phoui Sananikone came to power in the Kingdom of Laos in August 1958, under the instigation of the United States, they not only carried out various obstructions and sabotage to the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, but also openly demanded that the International Commission withdraw from Laos and dissolve. Recently, the United States has further instigated the Royal Lao Government to tear up the Geneva Accords and openly oppose the resumption of activities of the International Commission for Laos. At present, the situation in the Indochina Peninsula, especially in the Laotian region, has become tense due to the sabotage activities of the United States and the Lao government, threatening the peace of the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia. In order to safeguard the implementation of the Geneva Accords and to defend the peace of Indochina, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and our government issued statements on February 15 and February 18 respectively, calling on the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, especially the chairmen of the conference, Britain and the Soviet Union, as well as all countries and peoples concerned about peace, to oppose and stop the United States' conspiracy to instigate the Royal Lao Government to abandon the Geneva Accords, and to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos. On March 11, the Indian government, the chairman country of the International Commission for Laos, also stated that it is making efforts to restore the work of the International Commission for Laos.

    老挝国际委员会
    问：我们很关心最近印度支那局势的发展，希望介绍一下老挝国际委员会。
    北京读者　李明
    答：老挝国际监察和监督委员会，简称老挝国际委员会，是根据1954年7月签订的关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议而成立的。老挝国际委员会的任务是负责监察和监督实施日内瓦协议“关于老挝停止敌对行动协定”的条款。国际委员会由印度、波兰和加拿大三个国家的代表组成，由印度代表担任主席。
    老挝国际委员会自从1954年8月成立以来，对于监督日内瓦协议在老挝地区的实施，曾经进行了不少的工作，并且作出了有益的贡献。老挝停火的顺利实现、越南志愿人员和法兰西联邦军队的按时撤离，特别是老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队人员之间的和平团结的政治协议的达成，这些虽然主要是老挝人民坚持不懈地努力的结果，也是与老挝国际委员会的努力分不开的。此外，日内瓦协议还规定了老挝不得参加任何军事集团，不得为外国提供军事基地，不得接受外国军事援助，以及老挝政府保证全体公民不受任何歧视地参加全国共同生活、享受各种权利自由等。这些维护老挝和印度支那和平的重大措施还需要继续贯彻；负责监督日内瓦协议实施的国际委员会应该继续发挥它的作用。但老挝国际委员会却由于加拿大委员的坚持主张和印度委员的赞同，在1958年7月19日以二票对一票（波兰）的多数通过一项无限期休会的决定。
    1958年8月，老挝王国以培·萨纳尼空为代表的反动亲美势力执政以后，在美国的指使下，不但对日内瓦协议在老挝的实施进行种种阻挠和破坏，并且公然要求国际委员会撤离老挝和进行解散。最近，美国更策动老挝王国政府撕毁日内瓦协议，公开反对老挝国际委员会恢复活动。目前，印度支那半岛特别是老挝地区的形势，已经由于美国和老挝政府的破坏活动而趋于紧张，使整个印度支那和东南亚的和平遭到威胁。为了维护日内瓦协议的实施，为了保卫印度支那的和平，越南民主共和国政府和我国政府在2月15日和2月18日先后发表声明，呼吁日内瓦会议的参加国，特别是会议主席英国和苏联以及一切关心和平的国家和人民反对和制止美国策动老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议的阴谋，使老挝国际委员会恢复活动。3月11日，老挝国际委员会的主席国印度政府也表示，正在进行努力使老挝国际委员会恢复工作。
