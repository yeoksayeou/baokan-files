This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 13th: The Qin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shanxi Province, based on the local natural conditions and the characteristics of agricultural activities, has researched and formulated a set of "Agricultural Almanac" for comprehensively and systematically implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" to guide this year's agricultural Great Leap Forward, and it has been widely promoted throughout the county.

Last year, thanks to the implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution," the people of Qin County achieved an all-around bumper harvest. The total grain output reached 312.84 million catties, an increase of 66% compared to 1957. This year, the plan is to reach 1,000 catties of grain output per mu and a total output of 847 million catties, more than doubling last year's output. To ensure the realization of this grand plan, under the leadership of the Qin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they carefully examined and summarized the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The inspection revealed that in the implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" last year, there were problems such as being incomplete, not specific enough, and not thorough enough, which resulted in the various factors for increasing production not being fully utilized.

The Qin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party accepted last year's lessons and first specifically analyzed the county's natural conditions and the characteristics of agricultural activities brought about by them, and formulated an "Agricultural Almanac" for comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" to guide agricultural production.

This county is a merger of the original Qin County, Qinyuan County, and Xiangyuan County. The western region is mostly a mountainous area with colder climate and short frost-free periods; the central region is a hilly area with a mild climate and a frost-free period of more than 160 days; the eastern region is mostly a plain area with a warmer climate and a longer frost-free period. Due to different natural conditions, the crops grown also have their own characteristics. Therefore, the implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" must be carried out by category. Based on these circumstances, the County Committee selected communes that had better implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" and held on-site meetings to earnestly summarize and exchange experiences in this regard. Subsequently, symposiums were held with experienced old farmers, activists, grassroots cadres, and scientific and technical personnel to systematically solicit opinions from all parties, and an "Agricultural Almanac" for specific, localized, and mass-oriented implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" was researched and formulated.

This "Agricultural Almanac" is closely centered around the different characteristics and requirements of the twelve months and twenty-four solar terms throughout the year, clearly stipulating the central tasks for each period. The specific arrangements are: January, "seeding" into action; February, "fertilizer" in command; March, "soil" as the key; April, "density" first; May, "protect" seedlings; June, "harvest" is important; July, "management" in charge; August, "fertilizer" promoted; September, busy with "harvest and planting"; October, "soil" as the key; November, "water and fertilizer" start; December, "work reform" first. This "Agricultural Almanac" also specifically stipulates that each farming season should grasp the central link of the "Constitution." Grasping this link can drive the overall leap forward in agricultural production in each season. At the same time, it also stipulates the quality standards, time, and specific measures for completing various tasks in each season. For example, March is a good time for the soil to thaw and speed up spring plowing. This year, the county still has 300,000 mu of land that needs to be deep plowed. The task is heavy and the time is short. If this work is not grasped tightly, it will directly affect timely sowing. Therefore, the "Agricultural Almanac" stipulates that in March, "soil" is the key, with garden-style farming as the center to focus on water conservancy and land preparation. It is required that all spring-sown land be made level like a mirror, the soil as fine as flour, the ridges as straight as lines, large plots into squares, channels into nets, and water available for irrigation in every plot by Qingming Festival (Tomb Sweeping Day). In addition, it is necessary to combine early plowing, deep plowing, and universal plowing activities, eliminate underground pests, repair embankments and build dams, lining the inside and padding the outside, adjust and improve the soil, and carefully harrow to prevent drought and conserve moisture.

The formulation and implementation of the "Agricultural Almanac" has further helped cadres and masses throughout the county to unearth enormous potential for increasing production and enhanced their confidence in achieving a yield of 1,000 catties per mu this year. At the same time, it has also helped grassroots cadres improve their working methods. It not only enables them to have a clear understanding of the work for each season, month, and solar term, but also avoids the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another, reversing priorities, and enables them to formulate plans early, plan labor, and carry out production in an orderly manner.

In order to comprehensively and thoroughly implement the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution," the seven county committee secretaries of the entire county personally took charge and were responsible for each "character" of the "Eight-Character Constitution," and promptly checked and resolved the problems encountered in the implementation. Guidance committees for the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" were established at the county, commune, and management district levels. In addition, the county committee also established an "Eight-Character Constitution" technical research institute, with five research stations for "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density," which not only study new technologies, but are also responsible for technical guidance throughout the county. People's communes and management districts have established "Eight-Character Constitution" technical research institutes or technical research groups combining old farmers, rural grassroots cadres, and agricultural technicians, with approximately 2,300 people participating in the research throughout the county. The county committee also plans to expand the number of researchers in each commune to about 50,000 this spring through training methods, accounting for half of the county's labor force, so that the research work of the "Eight-Character Constitution" can be transformed into a mass movement for the whole people.

The "Agricultural Almanac" formulated by Qin County has been welcomed by the vast number of cadres and masses. They unanimously praised: "The Eight-Character Constitution is a treasure, the Agricultural Almanac is well-ordered, every measure is meticulous and ingenious, and a yield of 1,000 catties per mu is still not enough."

    按“八字宪法”订“农事皇历”
    沁县结合当地特点全面系统贯彻增产措施
    本报太原13日电　中共山西省沁县县委根据当地自然条件和农事活动的特点，研究订出一套全面系统贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，指导今年农业大跃进的“农事皇历”，已经在全县普遍推广。
    沁县人民在去年由于贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的结果，获得了全面丰收。粮食总产量达到三亿一千二百八十四万斤，比1957年提高66％。今年计划每亩粮食产量要达到一千斤，总产量要达到八亿四千七百万斤，比去年翻一番半还多。他们为了保证实现这一宏伟的计划，在中共沁县县委的领导下，细致地检查总结了1958年大跃进的成就和经验。检查中发现，去年在贯彻农业“八字宪法”中，存在着不全面、不具体、不彻底等问题，致使各种增产因素没有得到充分的发挥。
    中共沁县县委接受了去年的教训，首先具体分析了本县自然条件，以及由此带来的农事活动特点，制定了全面贯彻执行“八字宪法”的“农事皇历”，指导农业生产。
    这个县是由原来的沁县、沁源、襄垣三县合并的。西部地区，大部分是气候较冷，无霜期短的石山区；中部是气候温和，无霜期达一百六十多天的丘陵区；东部地区大部分是气候较暖，无霜期较长的平原区。因自然条件不同，种植作物也各有特点。因此在执行农业“八字宪法”的时候必须分类进行。县委根据这些情况，选择贯彻执行“八字宪法”较好的公社召开了现场会议，认真总结交流了这方面的经验。接着又分别召开了有经验的老农、积极分子、基层干部、科学技术人员等座谈会，系统地征求了各方面的意见，研究制订出了具体化、地方化、群众化贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的“农事皇历”。
    这个“农事皇历”是紧紧围绕全年十二个月二十四个节令不同的特点和要求，明确地规定了每个时期的中心工作。具体安排是：1月“种”上阵；2月“肥”挂帅；3月“土”为纲；4月“密”当先；5月“保”苗成；6月“收”为重；7月“管”掌印；8月“肥”升帐；9月闹“收种”；10月“土”为纲；11月“水、肥”上马；12月“工改”先行。这个“农事皇历”，还具体规定了各个农事季节应该抓“宪法”的每个中心环节，抓住这个环节，就能带动各个季节的农业生产全面跃进。同时也规定了各个季节完成各种工作的质量标准、时间和具体措施。例如：3月正是土地解冻加紧春耕的好时节，全县今年尚有三十万亩土地需要进行深翻，任务大，时间短，抓不紧这项工作，就会直接影响适时下种。因此在“农事皇历”中就规定了3月
  “土”为纲，以园田化为中心大抓水利和整地，要求在清明节前把全部春播的土地做到：地平如镜、土细如面、埂直如线、大片成方，渠道成网，片片有水，自流灌溉。并且要结合早耕、深耕、普耕的活动，消灭地下虫害，修边垒堰，里砌外垫，调剂和改良土壤，细致耙耱做到防旱保墒。
    通过“农事皇历”的制定和推行，进一步帮助全县干部和群众挖掘出巨大的增产潜力，增强实现今年亩产千斤的信心。同时，也帮助基层干部改进了工作方法。不仅使他们对每季、每月、每个节令的工作心中有数，还避免了顾此失彼，轻重倒置的现象发生，做到了及早制订计划，规划劳动力，使生产有条不紊地进行。
    为了全面彻底贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，全县七个县委书记对“八字宪法”的每个“字”，分别亲自挂帅，包干负责，及时检查解决执行当中的问题。县、公社、管理区都成立了贯彻执行“八字宪法”指导委员会，另外，县委还成立了“八字宪法”技术研究所，分设了“水、肥、土、种、密”五个研究站，既研究新的技术，又负责全县的技术指导。各人民公社和管理区都成立了由老农、农村基层干部和农业技术人员相结合的“八字宪法”技术研究所或技术研究小组，全县参加研究的约计二千三百多人。县委还计划通过训练的方法，把各公社的研究人员，在今春扩大到五万人左右，即占全县劳动力的一半，以便把“八字宪法”的研究工作，变成全民性的群众运动。
    沁县制定的“农事皇历”，受到了广大干部和群众的欢迎，他们一致赞扬说“八字宪法是个宝，农事皇历订的好，样样措施细又巧，亩产千斤还嫌少”。
