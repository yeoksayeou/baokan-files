Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 17th: The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued its session on the morning of the 17th, discussing various reports.

    Polish Minister of Transportation, Szalecki, stated in his speech that by 1965, Poland's passenger traffic will reach 1.6 billion, and freight traffic will reach 366 million tons. During the seven-year period, 1,300 kilometers of railway will be electrified, and by 1965, 4,500 kilometers of new and expanded highways will be constructed. He concluded by saying that although we will encounter many difficulties in our work, the 600,000 workers in the transportation sector are confident in completing this task.

    The Vice-Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, Zenon Nowak, stated in his speech that since the Party's 12th Plenary Session, the entire Party and the entire country have been paying attention to the Party Congress. He pointed out that the further development of socialist construction in Poland and the further improvement of the people's living standards depend on the implementation of the "Third Congress" resolutions. The implementation of the "Third Congress" resolutions is also our contribution to the competition between the two major systems in the world.

    Nowak pointed out that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party united the healthy forces within the Party, invigorated the Party's work, and enhanced the Party's prestige. He said that it cannot yet be considered that the struggle against revisionism and against dogmatism and sectarianism has ended. He pointed out that there are still some people within the Party who want to return to the old path. When talking about the main danger within the Party being revisionism, he pointed out that although we have knocked out the most poisonous fangs of the snake, the snake is hiding and still preparing to bite.

    Nowak also pointed out in his speech that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's work on the ideological front. When talking about agricultural production cooperatives, he pointed out that developing agricultural production cooperatives is the long-term prospect for Poland's development and the path to improving the living standards of farmers. We must not only carry out propaganda work, but also carry out concrete work every day, develop various forms of cooperative organizations, and establish production cooperatives when conditions are ripe.

    Polish Minister of Internal Affairs, Wicha, first pointed out when talking about the work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs that in recent years, the connection between the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the people has been strengthened, the people's compliance with the legal system has improved, criminal cases have decreased, and cases of criminals escaping justice have also decreased. However, the internal affairs departments must still vigorously combat criminal behavior, as well as waste and theft of public property. He said that the internal affairs departments must also pay attention to being vigilant against the activities of hostile elements. Recently, the enemy's espionage activities have increased, and they are mostly spies from the United States and Adenauer. He also pointed out that church clergy often violate state laws. Recently, there have been more than 600 incidents of violations of the law by clergy, and they must abide by government decrees.

    He pointed out that some people want to create chaos and unease in the western regions, and West German militarist forces are carrying out activities against Poland. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has uncovered several such cases. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will take measures to protect the security of the western regions.

    Also speaking at the morning session were the First Secretary of the Bialystok Provincial Committee, Wasiewicz, the Chairman of the Warsaw Provincial People's Committee, Mirzyński, and representatives of party organizations from some factories.

    Representatives of fraternal parties from Sweden, the Netherlands, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Portugal delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

    The conference unanimously adopted the list of the drafting committee for amending the Party Constitution this morning.

    The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 17th.

    Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Morawski, spoke first at the meeting. He said that based on the summary of our work by the Congress, we have the right to declare that the basic line formulated by the Party during the fourteen years of the people's regime has been correct. The Party's policies in areas such as national industrialization, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the development of socialist culture have been correct.

    Morawski also spoke about the merits of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The famous Polish writer, Leon Kruczkowski, spoke next. He said that our Party should pay special attention to work in the ideological and cultural circles.

    He said that the literary circles in Poland have initially achieved unity. The literary circles are not only a good place for revisionist activities, but also a place where bourgeois ideas are rampant. Some people even create ideological confusion in the literary circles. We ask the Congress to pay attention to this issue.

    Kruczkowski said that the Party's leadership over the cultural circles is to strengthen ideological education. We want to establish a socialist culture in Poland.

    The Chairman of the Polish Journalists Association, Rakowski, said in his speech that some revisionist remarks have appeared in the Polish press. However, in the second half of last year, the newspapers have recovered their health and have achieved achievements in promoting socialist ideas. Rakowski emphasized that the task of the Party's journalists is to ensure the combat effectiveness of the newspapers, to promote internationalism and the friendship of the peoples of all countries, to promote the unity between socialist countries and the superiority of socialism, and to promote socialist democracy. He said that to complete these tasks, journalists must improve their political level and sense of responsibility for their work. At the same time, Party organizations should support correct criticisms made by journalists.

    The Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Roman Nowak, said in his speech that the struggle against revisionism is of decisive significance to the unity of our Party, and revisionism is the greatest danger to our Party.

    Roman Nowak pointed out that it is necessary to fight against the phenomenon of suppressing criticism, which demoralizes some wavering party members. In addition, it is also necessary to combat fraud and waste. The new Party Constitution places higher demands on Party members, and it is the duty of Party members to fight against all bad phenomena.

    Nowak also talked about the issue of democratic centralism. He said that the unity of centralism and democracy is manifested in the observance of Party discipline from top to bottom. He also said that the Party must be concerned with improving the political level of Party members.

    The Communist Party of Tunisia, the Communist Party of Morocco, and the Communist Party of Australia delegations delivered congratulatory speeches to the Congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants.

    波兰党代会继续讨论各项报告
    发言代表主张加强党在思想战线的工作
    据新华社华沙17日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会17日上午继续进行，讨论各项报告。
    波兰交通部长斯柴莱茨基发言说，到1965年，波兰的客运量将达到十六亿人次，货运量将达到三亿六千六百万吨。在七年期间，将使一千三百公里铁路电气化，到1965年，新建和扩建的公路将为四千五百公里。他最后说，虽然我们将在工作中遇到很多困难，但是交通运输部门的六十万工作人员有信心完成这个任务。
    波兰部长会议副主席泽农·诺瓦克在发言中说，自从党的十二中全会以来，全党、全国都在注视党的代表大会。他指出，波兰的社会主义建设的进一步发展和人民生活的进一步提高，有赖于实现党的“三大”的决议。而实现“三大”决议也是我们在世界两大体系的竞赛中所作的贡献。
    诺瓦克指出，党的八中全会团结了党内的健康力量，活跃了党的工作，提高了党的威信。他说，现在还不能认为反对修正主义和反对教条、宗派主义的斗争已经结束。他指出，党内还有一部分人想回到老路上去。他在谈到党内的主要危险是修正主义时指出，我们虽然把毒蛇最毒的牙齿打掉了，但是毒蛇隐藏起来，还准备咬人。
    诺瓦克在发言中还指出要加强党在思想战线上的工作。他在谈到农业生产合作社时指出，发展农业生产合作社是波兰发展的远景，是提高农民生活水平的道路。我们不仅要进行宣传工作，而且每天都要进行具体工作，发展各种形式的合作组织，在条件成熟后成立生产合作社。
    波兰内务部长维哈在会上谈到内务部的工作时首先指出，在最近几年来，内务部的工作人员和人民的联系加强了，人民遵守法制的情况改善了，刑事案件减少了，犯罪分子漏网的情况也减少了，但内务部门还必须大力同犯罪行为，以及浪费、偷窃公共财产的现象进行斗争。他说，内务部门还必须注意警惕敌对分子的活动。最近以来，敌人的特务活动增加了，他们大多是美国和阿登纳的特务。他还指出，教会僧侣常常破坏国家法令。最近以来，神职人员违法事件达六百多起，他们必须遵守政府法令。
    他指出，有人想在西部地区制造混乱和不安，西德军国主义势力正进行反对波兰的活动，内务部已揭露了几起这一类的案件。内务部将采取措施保护西部地区的安全。
    在上午会议上发言的还有比亚威斯托克省委员会第一书记瓦谢维奇、华沙省人民委员会主席米日温斯基和一些工厂的党组织代表。
    瑞典、荷兰、智利、阿根廷、墨西哥和葡萄牙等国兄弟党代表在会上致了祝词。
    大会在今天上午一致通过了修改党章起草委员会的名单。
    波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会17日下午继续开会。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员莫拉夫斯基在会上首先发言。他说，根据代表大会对我们工作的总结，我们有权利这样宣布：在人民政权存在的十四年间，党所制订的基本路线是正确的。党在国家工业化、农业社会主义改造和发展社会主义文化等方面的政策是正确的。
    莫拉夫斯基还谈到苏联共产党的功绩。
    波兰著名作家列昂·克鲁奇科夫斯基接着发言。他说，我们党应当特别注意在思想界和文化界的工作。
    他说，波兰的文学界已初步达到了团结。文学界不仅是修正主义活动的良好地方，而且也是资产阶级思想泛滥的场所，甚至有些人在文学界中制造思想混乱，我们要求大会对这个问题给以注意。
    克鲁奇科夫斯基说，党对文化界的领导就是加强思想教育，我们要在波兰建立社会主义文化。
    波兰记者协会主席拉科夫斯基在发言时说，在波兰新闻界中，曾出现过一些修正主义言论。但在去年下半年，报刊已恢复健康，在宣传社会主义思想方面获得了成就。拉科夫斯基强调指出，党的新闻工作者的任务是保证报刊的战斗性，要宣传国际主义和各国人民的友谊，宣传社会主义国家间的团结和社会主义的优越性，宣传社会主义民主。他说，要完成这些任务，新闻工作者就必须提高自己的政治水平和对工作的责任感。同时，党组织应该支持新闻工作者提出的正确的批评。
    波兰统一工人党中央监察委员会主席罗曼·诺瓦克在发言时说，对我党的团结具有决定意义的是对修正主义的斗争，修正主义是我党的最大危险。
    罗曼·诺瓦克指出，必须与压制批评的现象作斗争，这种现象使一些不坚定的党员意志消沉。此外，还必须与舞弊和浪费现象作斗争。新党章对党员提出了更高的要求，同一切不良现象进行斗争是党员的义务。
    诺瓦克还谈了民主集中制问题，他说，集中和民主的统一表现在从上到下的遵守党的纪律上。他还说，党必须关心提高党员的政治水平。
    突尼斯共产党、摩洛哥共产党和澳大利亚共产党代表团向大会致了祝词。他们的讲话受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
