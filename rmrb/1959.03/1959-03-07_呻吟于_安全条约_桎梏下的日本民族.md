The Japanese Nation Groaning Under the Shackles of the "Security Treaty"

The Essence of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"

On May 7, 1952, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a Congressional meeting: "The Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' is not a charitable undertaking; it is certainly not to guarantee Japan's security. It is part of a plan to guarantee the security of the United States." In other words, this is an action taken by the United States for the United States, and it does not bear the obligation to defend Japan. Dulles's words revealed the essence of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is derived from the U.S. "Peace Treaty" with Japan. Its purpose is to allow U.S. troops to be stationed in Japan permanently, to turn the Japanese archipelago into a U.S. military base, and to promote the rearmament of Japan as a colonial army. However, matters concerning the location of U.S. troops in Japan, the number of troops stationed, the expenses of the stationed troops, and the relationship between the U.S. troops stationed in Japan and Japanese law and the Japanese people are not written in the articles of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Instead, the two governments sign an "Administrative Agreement" based on this treaty to determine these issues.

The central content of the "Administrative Agreement" is to allow the United States to establish bases for the army, navy, and air force anywhere and in any number within Japan, and to transport atomic and hydrogen bombs into Japan at will.

The "Administrative Agreement" also stipulates that Japan provides various conveniences to the U.S. troops stationed in Japan and exemptions from taxes and duties. U.S. military personnel and civilian employees and their families are not subject to Japanese passport laws and alien registration laws (Article 9), and do not need to obtain Japanese driver's licenses (Article 10). U.S. military jeeps and cars run amok, and even if they kill Japanese people, the Japanese side has no jurisdiction over crimes committed by U.S. troops in the performance of their duties (Article 17). In 1952, after the U.S. "Peace Treaty" with Japan, the "Security Treaty," and the "Administrative Agreement" came into effect, 115 people died and property losses exceeded 80 million yen due to traffic accidents caused by the U.S. military (according to a survey by the Japanese Police Agency). Although the families of the deceased and the victims requested compensation for losses, there was no follow-up. Even in the case of illegal acts committed when not performing official duties, it is only stipulated that "the United States authorities shall decide without delay whether to apply for payment of condolence money, and shall decide the amount when applying" (Article 18). Whether or not to give this money and how much to give is entirely at the discretion of the U.S. military authorities. When illegal acts occur in the performance of official duties, compensation is paid by the Japanese government, and the U.S. side later repays part of the amount payable in yen (Article 18).

To supplement the shortcomings of this agreement, supplementary agreements such as the "Agreement on Facilities and Areas" and the "Regulations on the Implementation of the Administrative Agreement" were also signed, and Japan also formulated many corresponding domestic laws. This whole set of things, under the name of "Administrative Agreement," binds the hands and feet of the Japanese people like a string of ropes.

In short, what runs through the U.S. "Peace Treaty" with Japan, the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the "Administrative Agreement" is that even if Japan sacrifices everything, there is no way to satisfy the military needs of the United States. From this, it can be seen that as long as the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" system continues to exist, Japan, which has been reduced to a subordinate position in the military, will inevitably be deprived of its freedom, independence, and national consciousness.

The Guise of "Independence and Autonomy"

As of November 1958, the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan was 70,000. Currently, the U.S. troops stationed in Japan are only the air force and navy, which are mainly equipped with nuclear weapons, and there are no army units such as infantry, artillery, or cavalry. At present, the U.S. military bases in Japan include 11 related to airports and firing ranges, 10 related to ports and naval ports, 40 supply facilities and military warehouse bases, 30 barracks and military residences, and 10 military factories, totaling 101. This does not include about 20 extremely secret military communication bases.

Judging from the fact that the number of U.S. military bases in Japan once reached 733, the current number is much smaller. However, this is neither because the United States has relaxed its military policy nor because the United States respects Japanese sovereignty. In fact, it is quite the opposite. This is because in the six years since the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was signed, due to the development of nuclear missile weapons by the United States, the old strategic system has been changed into a new atomic strategic system. To adapt to this situation, the United States has made some changes to its military bases and stationed troops in Japan. However, in terms of quality, it has been strengthened compared to the past. The Japanese "independence and autonomy" that the Japanese conservative parties have been vigorously promoting is nothing more than this.

When Japanese monopoly capital and its representative, the Japanese conservative regime, negotiated and signed the "Peace Treaty" and the "Security Treaty" with the United States during the U.S. invasion of Korea, they intended to solve the problem of blood transfusion and raw material supply to the Japanese economy through Japan-U.S. economic cooperation, especially by hoping that U.S. military expansion could utilize Japan's industrial capacity. This idea of the Japanese monopoly capital group has not changed in principle until now. It advocates that "(Japan) must belong to the free national camp, strengthen cooperation with the United States, and enhance its self-defense capabilities to counter communist aggression." In fact, it is to participate in the military policy of the United States, rely on U.S. aid to strengthen the foundation for reviving imperialism and strengthening rearmament, and to strengthen capital accumulation. This idea is to develop in the direction of "self-reliance" under the military subordination to the United States.

　　　Heinous Crimes

Under the protection of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement," U.S. troops stationed in Japan arbitrarily infringe upon the basic human rights and safety of the lives of the Japanese people. Their crimes are too numerous to mention. There are many specific examples. For example, the "Asahi Shimbun" published a letter of complaint from a housewife in its reader's column. Her husband worked at a U.S. military base, and before his contract expired, he was suddenly dismissed for no reason one day, and the U.S. military police forced them to move. There was also a female typist who worked at the Tachikawa U.S. military base out of necessity for a living, who complained to the public that she was raped by a U.S. soldier and contracted a terrible venereal disease. According to the "Japan Weekly," a first-year high school girl living in Haishima Village, Tama County, near Tokyo, was dragged into the wilderness and raped by several U.S. soldiers. Later, she was forced to become a poor prostitute.

In addition, the "Yumiko Incident" in Okinawa in September 1955 (six-year-old Yumiko was raped and killed by a U.S. soldier), the "Jerard Incident" in January 1957, and the atrocity of U.S. troops shooting and killing university student Miyamura Yoshizumi for no reason in September 1958 were all sensational events at home and abroad.

In October 1953, the provisions on criminal jurisdiction in the "Administrative Agreement" were amended to recognize that the Japanese side has jurisdiction over illegal acts committed by U.S. troops when not performing official duties. However, there is also an additional provision here: "If the U.S. side requests the Japanese side to waive jurisdiction, the Japanese side shall give it consideration in good faith." Moreover, the U.S. military authorities almost always claim that all crimes committed by U.S. troops are "committed in the performance of official duties," and refuse the jurisdiction of the Japanese side. Even if U.S. troops break into private homes and rape Japanese women while out and about, they say that it is "in the performance of official duties" and do not hand over jurisdiction to the Japanese side.

According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Justice, within one year of the amendment to the provisions on criminal jurisdiction (from October 29, 1953, to October 31, 1954), the Japanese Public Prosecutor's Office accepted 4,492 criminal cases of crimes committed by U.S. troops and their families against the Japanese people, and 1,973 cases of crimes under special laws (violations of the Narcotics Control Law and violations of the Traffic Control Law). The criminal crime rate alone (the monthly average ratio calculated per thousand people) is nearly three times the Japanese crime rate. Compared with the Japanese population, the Japanese people are robbed by U.S. troops every two days; Japanese women are raped by U.S. soldiers every four days; an average of four Japanese people are injured by U.S. troops every day; and an average of three Japanese people are injured or disabled due to traffic accidents caused by U.S. troops every day.

If we add the number of crimes in U.S. military bases where Japanese officials are not allowed to enter, the above figures would probably increase several times. When various business operators who target U.S. troops accuse U.S. troops of crimes, the U.S. military authorities use the pretext of "preventing crime" to block off the relevant shops and entire streets, designating them as areas where U.S. troops are not allowed to enter, thereby ruining their livelihoods. This is a very vicious method. Therefore, many crimes are not dared to be exposed.

U.S. troops have also set up secret intelligence agencies in Japan to persecute the Japanese people. In the past 14 years, I don't know how many people who have been repatriated from the Soviet Union and people who have connections with the Soviet Union have been assassinated one after another. The kidnapping and imprisonment of the famous writer Watanabe Koji was related to this kind of secret agency. A secret agency headed by a U.S. Lieutenant Colonel named Cannon is notorious. It is said that Cannon has left Japan and the agency no longer exists. However, according to a report in the "Shukan Shincho" magazine on June 30, 1958, a person who was once listed by Cannon as "Man No. 19" and was to be persecuted is still haunted by lingering fears and does not believe that this agency has been abolished, and therefore dares not fully expose the inhuman atrocities of Cannon's secret agency. The depth of the terror that U.S. military atrocities have caused to the Japanese people can be seen from this.

The Struggle to Abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"

The Japanese conservative parties have been promoting that the U.S. reconciliation with Japan is based on the spirit of "peace, mediation, and trust," and that U.S. troops are stationed in Japan to "guarantee Japan's security" from the "communist threat." This propaganda has had a strong impact on the classes where feudal traditions are still deeply rooted, such as farmers and fishermen (about 30% of the population) and small business operators (17% to 19% of the population). Despite this, the broad masses of the Japanese people cannot be deceived after all. They have launched a movement to demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive to get rid of the U.S. world strategic system.

This movement has grown stronger and stronger, taking the trend of the Kishida Nobusuke government negotiating to revise the "Security Treaty" as an opportunity. This movement, combined with the desire to take a neutral path, has determined the policy of opposing the nuclear-armed militarization route formulated by the U.S.-Japan monopoly capital based on the policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, because Japan's reproduction is greatly restricted due to its reliance on U.S. raw materials, contradictions have arisen between Japanese and U.S. monopoly capital. Some people in the Japanese monopoly capital group are also reflecting on and are wary of being further dragged into U.S. military policy. There is a trend within Japanese monopoly capital to think that it is too early to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The movement to abolish the "Security Treaty," which was launched following the struggle against the "Performance Rating System" and the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law," is constantly developing. The four groups of the Japan National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the National Liaison Council Against Military Bases, and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan have so far maintained their independence in the movement and have resolutely fought against the nuclear-armed militarization policy of the Kishida Nobusuke government separately. However, now they have organized a joint struggle with the common goal of breaking the "Security Treaty" system and restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations as a bond. The Japanese Peace Committee has also strengthened the unity of national peace activists and launched a powerful movement to abolish the "Security Treaty" and realize Japan's neutrality. The core of these movements is the working class, which accounts for 42% to 46% of the national population, and intellectuals, who account for about 5% of the population.

Although for people living far away from U.S. military bases (mainly farmers), the connection between the "Security Treaty" and daily life is not as direct as the "Performance Rating System" and the "Police Duties Law." However, in places where land has been occupied by U.S. troops, the "Security Treaty" is already a matter of life and death for farmers. Of course, in the struggle against the bases, there are also cases like the Hyakurigahara base in Ibaraki Prefecture, where the deceptive propaganda of the Defense Agency has played a destructive role, thus causing some difficulties for the movement to abolish the "Security Treaty." However, history is created by the people, and the people promote the progress of history. Today, the Japanese people are rising up in an unremitting struggle to abolish the "Security Treaty" and realize peaceful coexistence with the confidence to reverse history with their own hands.

    呻吟于“安全条约”桎梏下的日本民族
    日本和平委员会常任理事
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务局长  黑田秀俊
    日美“安全条约”的实质
    1952年5月7日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在国会会议上说：“日美‘安全条约’，不是慈善事业，当然不是为了保障日本的安全。这是保障美国安全计划的一部分。”也就是说，这是美国为美国而采取的行动，并不负有保卫日本的义务。杜勒斯这句话，道破了日美“安全条约”的实质。
    日美“安全条约”是从美国对日“和约”派生出来的。其目的是要使美军永久驻在日本，把日本列岛变成美国的军事基地，以及促进日本作为殖民地军队的重整军备。但是，有关美军在日本的驻地、驻军人数、驻军经费，以及驻日美军同日本法律及日本国民的关系等等，全不写在日美“安全条约”的条文内，而是另由日美两国政府根据这个条约签订一个“行政协定”来确定这些问题。
    “行政协定”的中心内容，是允许美国不拘任何地方、不拘任何数量地在日本境内建立陆海空三军基地，而且可以随心所欲地向日本运进原子弹和氢弹。
    “行政协定”还规定日本向驻日美军提供各种方便以及免征税赋等条款。美国军队的构成人员与文职人员及其家属，不适用日本的护照法令及外侨登记法令（第九条），不需领日本的汽车驾驶许可证（第十条）。美军的吉普车和小汽车横冲直撞，即使撞死日本人，日本方面对美军在执行公务中的犯罪也没有裁判权（第十七条）。在美国对日“和约”、“安全条约”和“行政协定”生效后的1952年，因美军方面的交通肇事，死了一百一十五人，财物损失在八千万日元以上（据日本警察厅调查）。死者家属和受害者，虽然要求赔偿损失，但是没有下文。即便是在非执行公务时发生的不法行为，也只是规定“合众国当局毫不拖延决定是否申请支付抚恤金，并在申请时决定其数目”（第十八条），至于给不给这笔钱，给多少，完全由美军当局随意处理。在执行公务中发生不法行为时，赔偿金由日本政府发给，以后由美国方面以日元偿还应支付的一部分（第十八条）。
    为了补充这个协定的不足，还签订“关于设施及地区的协定”及“关于实现行政协定的规定”等附件，而且日本还制定了许多相应的国内法令。这一整套的东西，冠以“行政协定”的名称，像一串绳子似地束缚着日本人民的手脚。
    总之，贯穿着美国对日“和约”、日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”的东西，就是为了满足美国的军事需要，即使日本牺牲一切也毫无办法。由此可见，只要旧金山“和约”体制继续存在，在军事上沦为从属地位的日本，就不可避免地要被剥夺掉它的自由独立和民族意识。
    “独立自主”的幌子
    到1958年11月为止，驻日美军总计七万人。现在驻在日本的美国军队，仅仅是以拥有核武器装备部队为主力的空军和海军，而没有步兵、炮兵、骑兵等陆军部队。目前，美国在日本的军事基地，与飞机场、打靶场有关的有十一个，与港口、军港有关的十个，补给设施和军用仓库基地四十个，兵营和军人住宅三十处，军用工厂十处，总计一百零一处。这里还不包括大约二十个极端秘密的军事通讯基地在内。
    从美国在日本的军事基地一度达到七百三十三个的情况来看，现在的数字是少多了。但是，这既不是由于美国放松了它的军事政策，也不是由于美国尊重日本主权所致，事实上毋宁说是恰恰与此相反。这是因为自从日美签订“安全条约”后的六年内，由于美国发展了核导弹武器，旧的战略体系改变成一种新的原子战略体系，为了适应这种情况，美国把它在日本的军事基地和驻军部队作了一些变动。而在质量方面反而比过去加强了。日本保守政党所大肆宣扬的日本“独立自主”，不过是这么一回事。
    日本垄断资本及其代表日本保守政权，在美国侵朝战争期间同美国谈判签订对日“和约”和“安全条约”时，打算通过日美经济合作，特别是指望美国的军事扩张能利用日本的工业能力，因之解决给日本经济输血和供应原料的问题。日本垄断资本集团的这种想法，从原则上说来，直到现在还没有改变。它宣传“（日本）必须属于自由国家阵营，同美国加强合作，增强自卫能力，以对抗共产主义的侵略”。实际上，就是要参与美国的军事政策，依靠美国的援助来为复活帝国主义加强重整军备的基础，以及加强资本的积累。这种想法也就是在军事上从属于美国的情况下，朝着“自立”的方向发展。
          滔　天　罪　行
    在日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”的庇护下，驻日美军随意侵犯日本人民的基本人权和生命安全。他们的罪行是罄竹难书的。具体例子是很多的。比如，“朝日新闻”的读者来信栏曾经发表了一位家庭妇女的控诉信。她的丈夫在美军基地作工，在合同没有满期的时候，有一天突然地无故被解雇，美国宪兵还强迫他们搬家。还有一个为生计所迫在立川美军基地工作的女打字员，向社会上控诉她被美军奸污后染上可怕的性病的事实。又据“日本周报”报道，住在东京附近多摩郡拜岛村的一个高中一年级女学生，被几个美国大兵拉到野外去奸污。后来她被迫沦为可怜的娼妓。
    此外，1955年9月在冲绳发生的“由美子事件”（六岁的由美子被美军强奸致死）、1957年1月“哲腊德事件”和1958年9月美军无故开枪打死大学生宫村祥之等暴行，都是轰动国内外的事情。
    1953年10月，“行政协定”中有关刑事裁判权条款有了改动，承认美军在非执行公务期间发生的不法行为，日本方面有裁判权。但是，在这里还有一个附加的规定：“如果美国方面要求日本方面放弃裁判权，日本方面要善意地给予考虑”。而且，美军当局几乎把美军的一切犯罪行为都说成是“在执行公务中发生的”，而拒绝日本方面的裁判。美军在外出中，即使私入民宅强奸日本妇女，也说成是“在执行公务中”，不把裁判权交给日本方面。
    据日本法务省公布的统计材料，自从修改刑事裁判权条款一年的时间内（自1953年10月29日至1954年10月31日），美军及其家属侵犯日本人民的罪行，经日本检察厅受理的有刑事犯罪案件四千四百九十二件，特别法犯罪案件（违反麻醉药品取缔法及违反交通取缔法案件）一千九百七十三件。仅刑事犯罪率（按人口千人计算的每月平均比例）就将近日本犯罪率的三倍。从美军的刑事犯罪案件和日本人口相比，就是日本人民每隔两天要遭受一次美军的抢劫；日本妇女每隔四天要遭到美国大兵的一次强奸暴行；每一天平均有四个日本人被美军的暴行伤害；每一天平均有三个日本人因美军的交通肇事受伤或变成残废。
    如果加上不准日本官吏入境的美军基地的犯罪件数，恐怕以上的数字还要增加好几倍。美军当局遇有以美军为对象的各种营业人员控告美军罪行时，则借口“防止犯罪”，把有关的店铺和整条街封锁起来，圈定为不准美军进入的地区，以断送他们的生计。这种手段十分毒辣。因此，大量的罪行无人敢揭发。
    美军还在日本设立秘密的特务机关，迫害日本人民。过去十四年间，不知有多少从苏联遣返回国的人和与苏联有联系的人，相继被暗杀。著名作家鹿地亘被绑架、监禁的事件，就与这种秘密机关有关。有一个叫加农的美军中校主持的秘密机关，是臭名昭著的。据说，加农已经离开日本，机关也不存在了。但是，据1958年6月30日“周刊新潮”杂志报道，一个曾经被加农列为“第十九号男子”而要加以迫害的人，至今余悸未消，不相信这个机关已撤消，因而不敢全面地揭发加农秘密机关的惨无人道的暴行。美军暴行给日本人民造成的恐怖心理之深于兹可见。废除日美“安全条约”的斗争
    日本的保守政党，专期以来宣传美国对日媾和，是基于“和介和信赖”的精神，美军驻在日本是为了从“共产主义威胁”下“保障日本的安全”。这种宣传在农民渔民（约占人口的30％），小企业者（占人口17％至19％）封建传统仍然根深蒂固的阶层，留下了强烈的影响。尽管如此，广大日本人民毕竟是欺骗不了的。他们已经开展了要求废除日美“安全条约”的运动，争取摆脱美国的世界战略体系。
    这一运动以岸信介政府谈判修改“安全条约”的动向为契机，日益壮大起来。这一运动和渴望走中立道路的意愿结合起来，确定了反对美日垄断资本基于敌视中苏政策而制定的核武装军事化路线的方针。再者，由于日本依靠美国的原料，再生产受到很大的限制，日美垄断资本之间产生了矛盾。在日本垄断资本集团中也有人对进一步拖入美国军事政策持有反省和警惕的态度。在日本垄断资本内部开始出现了认为修改日美“安全条约”为期尚早的动向。
    继反对“勤务评定制度”和反对修改“警职法”斗争而掀起的废除“安全条约”的运动，在不断地发展着。日本拥护宪法国民联合会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、全国反对军事基地联络会议、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会四个团体和日本工会总评议会，到现在为止都是在运动中各自保持独立性，分别地同岸信介政府的核武装军事化政策进行坚决斗争。然而，现在它们以打破“安全条约”体系、恢复日中邦交的共同目标为纽带，组织了联合斗争。日本和平委员会也加强了全国和平运动者的团结，为废除“安全条约”、实现日本的中立而掀起强大的运动。这些运动的核心，是占全国人口42％至46％的工人阶级和约占人口5％的知识分子。
    虽然对于居住在离美军基地远的地方的人民（主要是农民）来说，“安全条约”同日常生活的联系，不如“勤务评定制度”和“警职法”那末直接。但是，在被美军霸占土地的地方，“安全条约”已经是农民生死存亡的问题。当然，在反对基地的斗争当中，也有像茨城县百里原基地那样，防卫厅的欺骗宣传起了破坏作用，因而给废除“安全条约”的运动造成了一些困难。但是，历史是人民群众创造的，人民群众推动历史前进。今天，日本人民正怀着用自己的手来扭转历史的信心，为废除“安全条约”、实现和平共处而挺身进行不懈的斗争。
