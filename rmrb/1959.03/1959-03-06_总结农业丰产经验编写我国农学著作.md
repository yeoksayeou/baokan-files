    Summarize Agricultural Abundance Experiences to Compile China's Agricultural Works
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Systematically summarizing China's large-scale agricultural abundance experiences and compiling agricultural theoretical works is one of the important tasks of China's agricultural scientific research. Recently, the National Agricultural Science and Technology Research Work Conference held by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has made specific arrangements for the above tasks, requiring the compilation of agricultural theoretical works on rice, wheat, cotton, soil, fertilizer, fruit tree cultivation, silkworm rearing, plant protection, and infectious diseases of livestock within this year. This is a major event in China's agricultural scientific research.

    1958 was an extraordinary year on China's agricultural front. China's agricultural production achieved a great bumper harvest. The broad masses of farmers not only saw many high-yield experimental fields in agricultural production, but also achieved large-scale bumper harvests of crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton. There were many bold revolutionary attempts in agricultural production technology measures, and a large amount of valuable abundance experience was obtained. Under the leadership of the Party, due to the implementation of the policy of serving national economic construction in scientific research work, the implementation of the mass line, the simultaneous use of indigenous and foreign methods, and the measures such as agricultural scientific and technological personnel going to the mountains and rural areas, China's agricultural scientific research work has made great achievements in water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, management, as well as animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, fruit tree cultivation, vegetables, and agricultural meteorology. Now, there is an urgent need to systematically and comprehensively summarize the rich production experience created by the masses and the achievements of agricultural scientific research, and elevate it to the height of theory.

    Summarizing China's agricultural abundance experiences and engaging in theoretical works is to scientifically analyze and generalize a large number of rich materials and correctly explain these objective laws. This theoretical work will not only lay the foundation for creating China's agricultural science, but also play a huge role in guiding China's agricultural production. Theory comes from production practice, but it in turn gives guidance to production practice. Without the experience of China's high-yield production, high-yield agricultural theoretical works would not be produced; with the research and writing of high-yield theory, the high-speed development of China's agricultural production can be promoted.

    Now there are conditions for starting theoretical works. First, in addition to high-yield experimental fields last year, there were more than 100 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields with more than 1,000 jin per mu. The number of high-yield fields will be even greater this year. Large-scale high yields provide an inexhaustible source of materials for agricultural theoretical works, which is the material basis for theoretical works. Second, the scientific and technological team is growing stronger. In addition to the research institutions and scientific workers in the central, provincial, municipal, and autonomous regions, the scientific research network at the grassroots level and in the people's communes has initially taken shape, which is a powerful assistant for agricultural scientific research. Third, China's agricultural scientific and technological workers have accumulated some experience last year, and have achieved significant results in research work in several aspects. Fourth, after the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification and study, the communist consciousness of scientific and technological personnel has been greatly improved, the spirit of collectivist collaboration has been greatly strengthened, and the absolute leadership of the Party in scientific research work has been established. All of these are the material conditions and ideological guarantees for realizing agricultural theoretical works.

    To systematically summarize China's high-yield experience, it is necessary to implement the principle of linking theory with practice and combining scientific personnel with the masses. The National Agricultural Science and Technology Research Work Conference has determined that one of the important methods for summarizing abundance experience is to set up base points, organize relevant agricultural scientific personnel to go to the countryside to work with farmers, participate in the entire production process of high-yield fields, and make systematic observations and records of crops from sowing to harvest, master rich scientific data, and then make scientific summaries. This is a method for scientific workers to transform their thinking and a correct way for scientific research work. Scientific workers going to the countryside to create high-yield fields with farmers can not only obtain the help of farmers through production practice, but also give farmers some guidance in science and technology. Of course, in addition to setting up base points and scientific workers directly participating in production labor, how scientific research institutions understand the production situation across the country and combine points and areas is also necessary and indispensable.

    To summarize China's high-yield experience and engage in agricultural theoretical works, it is necessary to implement the national unified planning policy and implement close collaboration between central and local research institutions and higher agricultural colleges. This is because the locality of agricultural production is very strong. Various crops, under certain times, places, and production conditions, have their commonality in addition to their particularity. China has a vast area, and the task of summarizing the rich experience of agricultural production in different regions is arduous. At the same time, the factors for achieving high-yield agricultural abundance are not isolated. It is impossible to do well by studying and analyzing from a single discipline and single factor. Irrigation, deep plowing, fertilization, close planting, plant protection, and field management are all causally related and organically linked. Therefore, when summarizing experience, the research institutions of the central government and local governments, between regions, between disciplines, and between several departments related to the same discipline, need to carry forward the spirit of collectivism, cooperate with each other, and everyone should come together to conduct joint research and summary. In this way, we can summarize the rich and colorful production experience of various parts of China well, and better reflect these experiences in various agricultural theoretical works.

    The agricultural theoretical works compiled this year strive to achieve a higher level, and can truly achieve the theory that is summarized from China's objective reality and is verified in future practice. However, this does not mean that the newly written agricultural theory will not be revised in the future. Now, some people have this idea that the agricultural theoretical works written this year may be revised next year, and it is better to write them next year or even later than to write them this year. This idea is wrong. Things are moving and changing every day, and people's understanding of the laws of nature is also gradually developing. The several agricultural theoretical works that are about to be written are based on last year's high-yield experience. This experience is certainly very valuable, but it cannot be said that this experience is already very complete; last year's large-scale high yield in China was unprecedented, but it cannot be said that high yield has reached its peak. These experiences still need to be supplemented, enriched, and developed by new production practices this year and in the future. Some of these experiences may even be completely negated due to changes in conditions. There are many such examples in natural science. In agriculture, the old concept that wheat is a shallow-cultivated crop and that "wheat will lodge if it exceeds 500,000 ears per mu" was not overturned by last year's practice of deep plowing and close planting? In the past, it was generally believed that China's soil was not deficient in phosphorus and potassium, and that the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers was ineffective. However, did not many places achieve high yields last year by adopting the method of combined use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers? Human beings' ability to understand nature and conquer nature is infinite, and production is constantly developing. Since there is a new understanding of nature and new practices, past views and theories cannot but be revised. Therefore, the kind of works that are never written, and if they are written, they attempt to never be revised, are contrary to the viewpoint of materialist dialectics.

    This year's task of agricultural scientific research in China is arduous. In addition to summarizing experience and writing books and establishing theories, there are many important agricultural scientific research tasks to be completed, such as researching and creating agricultural machines according to different regions and different crops in China; vigorously carrying out soil census and identification with deep tillage as the main focus; full fat and full pregnancy of livestock, multi-fetal and multi-production, breed improvement of livestock and poultry, completely eliminating and controlling several major diseases that seriously harm livestock; comprehensive prevention and control measures for major diseases of wheat, rice, cotton, etc., manufacture and application of native pesticides; continuing to sort out national crop varieties, and continuously select and breed new varieties with high yield and high quality, etc. These research tasks must be carried out simultaneously. This is a glorious and arduous task for China's agricultural scientific work. We must continue to go all out, continue to criticize conservative ideas, carry forward the spirit of daring to think and dare to do combined with scientific analysis, carry forward the spirit of collectivist collaboration, mobilize all positive factors, and strive to support a greater leap forward in this year's agricultural production and overfulfill this year's agricultural scientific research plan.

    总结农业丰产经验编写我国农学著作
    本报评论员
    系统地总结我国农业大面积丰产经验，编写农业理论著作，是我国农业科学研究工作的重要任务之一。最近，中国农业科学院召开的全国农业科学技术研究工作会议上，已将上述任务作了具体的安排，要求在今年内编写出水稻、小麦、棉花、土壤、肥料、果树栽培、栽桑、植物保护、家畜传染病等农业理论著作。这是我国农业科学研究工作的一件大事。
    1958年是我国农业战线上不平凡的一年。我国农业生产取得了伟大的丰收。广大农民在农业生产上不仅出现了许多高额丰产试验田，而且也取得了水稻、小麦、棉花等作物大面积的丰收，在农业生产的技术措施上有许多大胆的革命尝试，取得了大量宝贵的丰产经验。我国的农业科学研究工作，在党的领导下，由于贯彻执行了科学研究工作为国民经济建设服务的方针，贯彻执行了群众路线，实行土洋并举，农业科学技术人员上山下乡等措施，农业科学研究工作在水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管以及畜牧兽医、果树栽培、蔬菜、农业气象等方面都取得了很大成就。现在，迫切需要系统地全面地把群众创造的丰富的生产经验和农业科学研究的成果加以总结，使它上升到理论的高度。
    总结我国农业丰产经验，从事理论著作，就是把大量的丰富材料，加以科学的分析、概括，正确地阐释这些客观规律。这种理论著作工作，不仅将为创立我国的农业科学打下基础，而且对于指导我国的农业生产将会发生极大的作用。理论来源于生产实践，但它反过来又给生产实践以指导。没有我国高额丰产的经验，不会产生高额丰产的农业理论著作；有了高额丰产理论的研究和著作，又能推动我国农业生产高速度的发展。
    现在着手理论著作是有条件的。第一，去年除了高额丰产试验田外，大面积丰产千斤以上的还有一亿亩之多。今年丰产田的数字将会更多。大面积的高产为农业理论著作提供了取之不尽的材料来源，这是理论著作的物质基础。第二，科学技术队伍日益壮大，除了中央、省、市、自治区的研究机构和科学工作者以外，基层和人民公社科学研究网已初步形成，这是农业科学研究工作的一支强大的助手。第三，我国的农业科学技术工作者在去年已经积累了一些经验，并且在若干方面的研究工作已取得重大的成果。第四，经过反右派斗争和整风学习，科学技术人员的共产主义觉悟大大提高，集体主义的协作精神大为加强，党在科学研究工作中的绝对领导已经确立。凡此种种，都是实现农业理论著作的物质条件和思想保证。
  系统地总结我国高产经验，必须贯彻执行理论和实际联系，科学人员和群众相结合的原则。这次全国农业科学研究工作会议上已经确定，总结丰产经验的重要方法之一是设立基点，组织有关农业科学人员下乡同农民一起生产劳动，参加整个丰产田的生产过程，从播种到收获，对农作物作系统的观察、记载，掌握丰富的科学资料，然后作出科学的总结。这是科学工作者改造思想的方法，也是科学研究工作的正确途径。科学工作者下乡同农民一起创造丰产田，既可通过生产实践，取得农民的帮助，又能在科学技术方面给农民一些指导。当然，除了搞基点，科学工作者直接参加生产劳动的办法之外，科学研究机构如何了解全国各地生产情况，点和面结合，也是必要的、不可缺少的。
    总结我国高产经验，从事农业理论著作，要根据全国一盘棋的方针，实行中央同地方研究机关和高等农业院校之间的密切协作。这是因为，农业生产的地方性很强，各种作物在一定时间、地点和生产条件下，除了有它的共同性之外，还有它的特殊性。我国地区辽阔，要把不同地区农业生产的丰富经验总结起来，任务是艰巨的。同时，取得农业高额丰产的因素不是孤立的，仅从某一门学科单因子地去研究、分析，是不可能做好的。灌溉、深耕、施肥、密植、植物保护、田间管理等，都是互为因果，有机联系着的。所以，在总结经验的时候，中央同地方的研究机构、地区同地区之间、学科同学科之间，同一学科有关的几个部门之间，就需要发扬集体主义精神，协同配合，大家都来动手共同研究和总结。这样，才能把我国各地丰富多彩的生产经验总结得好，才能更好地把这些经验反映到各种农业理论著作中去。
    今年编写的农业理论著作力求达到较高的水平，真正能够做到是从我国客观实际总结出来而又在今后实践中得到证实的理论。但是，这绝不是说新著农业理论以后不再作任何修改。现在，有的人有这种想法，今年写出的农业理论著作，说不定明年又要修改，与其今年写还不如明年乃至以后去写。这种想法是不对的。事物是天天在运动变化的，人们对自然规律的认识也是逐渐发展的。即将着手编写的几本农业理论著作，是在去年高产经验的基础上写的，这些经验固然非常宝贵，但是不能说这些经验就已经十分完备了；去年我国大面积高产是空前的，但不能说高产已达到了顶峰。这些经验还有待于今年和以后新的生产实践去补充它、丰富它、发展它，其中某些经验，由于条件的变化，甚至还会完全被否定。在自然科学方面这种例子很多。就以农业来说，过去一向认为小麦是浅耕作物，“小麦每亩超过五十万穗就要倒伏”的陈旧观念，不是为去年深耕、密植的实践所推翻了吗？过去一般认为我国土壤不缺磷、钾，施用磷、钾肥也无效，但是，去年许多地方采取氮、磷、钾肥配合使用的方法，不是也取得了高产吗？人类认识自然和征服自然的能力是无限的，生产是不断向前发展的。既然对自然有了新的认识，又有了新的实践，这就不能不修改过去的观点和理论。因而，那种不写则已，写则企图永不修改的著作，是违反唯物辩证主义观点的。
    今年我国农业科学研究工作的任务是繁重的，除了总结经验、著书立说以外，还有许多重要的农业科学研究任务要去完成，诸如根据我国不同地区、不同作物，研究创制农业机器；大力开展以深耕地为主的土壤普查鉴定；牲畜的满膘满怀、多胎多产，家畜、家禽的品种改良，彻底消灭和控制严重为害家畜的几种主要的疾病；小麦、水稻、棉花等主要病害的全面防治措施，土农药的制造和应用；继续整理全国作物品种，不断选育高产优质的新品种，等等，这些研究任务都要同时进行。这是我国农业科学工作光荣而艰巨的任务，必须继续鼓足干劲，继续批判保守思想，发扬敢想敢干和科学分析相结合的精神，发扬集体主义协作精神，调动一切积极因素，为支援今年农业生产的更大跃进和超额完成今年农业科学研究计划而努力。
