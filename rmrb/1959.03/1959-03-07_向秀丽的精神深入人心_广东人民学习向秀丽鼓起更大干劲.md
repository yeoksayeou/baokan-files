The Spirit of Xiang Xiuli Strikes Deeply into People's Hearts
Guangdong People Learn from Xiang Xiuli and Muster Greater Enthusiasm

(Our dispatch from Guangzhou, March 6th) The noble spirit of Xiang Xiuli, an outstanding Communist Party member hailed as the Party's good daughter, who heroically sacrificed herself to protect the factory, is having a widespread and profound impact on the people of Guangzhou. In the past month, more than 80,000 workers, students, and residents have gone to the Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory where Xiang Xiuli worked to express their condolences or listen to reports about her deeds. People have expressed their determination to learn from her example.

The Guangzhou newspapers' reports in late January of Xiang Xiuli's selfless and self-sacrificing heroic deeds deeply moved the people of Guangzhou. On the first day Guangzhou Daily published the report, it received more than 200 letters, poems, and articles from the masses expressing condolences and their determination to learn Xiang Xiuli's noble communist style. The Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory also received a large number of letters with the same content from various sources. At the same time, groups of people came to the factory to express condolences to the Party branch and the trade union, to listen to reports about Xiang Xiuli's life, or to invite the Party branch to send people to report to their units. Many units and schools have launched activities to learn from Xiang Xiuli. People have also automatically linked this to examining and criticizing their own individualistic thoughts, determined to learn from Xiang Xiuli, improve their ideological awareness, and work and study hard. Li Yongquan, a member of the Communist Youth League at the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, was encouraged by Xiang Xiuli's noble spirit and took the lead in braving the danger on a cold night, jumping into the turbulent and icy Pearl River to rescue a wooden boat loaded with gasoline that was about to explode.

The activities of learning from Xiang Xiuli have not only greatly promoted the growth of people's communist ideology but have also inspired people to work harder and actively promote production and construction. Hundreds of thousands of shock teams, workshops, groups, and classes in factories, shops, and schools throughout Guangzhou have been named after Xiang Xiuli, using the spirit of Xiang Xiuli to promote production and work. People say: "Selfless for the collective, Xiang Xiuli, heroic deeds will be passed down forever, everyone learns from Xiang Xiuli, socialism will be built soon." The Xingqun Pharmaceutical Factory, with more than 300 employees, from leaders to the masses, deeply linked and examined individual ideological work based on the spirit of Xiang Xiuli. When they criticized and urged others, they would say: "Have you learned the spirit of Xiang Xiuli?" With the help of the "Xiang Xiuli Shock Team," all the factory workers actively brought into play their energy and drilling spirit, improved production technology, and reversed the slackening production situation in the first half of January in a short period, finally overfulfilling the monthly output value plan for January. The workers of Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory, after proposing to use practical actions to mourn their close companion, each production team posted their leaping-forward determination letters on the "Xiang Xiuli Memorial Column." They said: "If we engage in individualism again, we have to think about how Xiang Xiuli sacrificed herself!" The workers in the chemical workshop where Xiang Xiuli worked before her death are working hard to adopt new production measures, striving to increase the output in the first quarter by one and a half times compared to the previous quarter, as a tribute to her memory.

Xiang Xiuli's noble spirit is also having a profound impact on the people in urban and rural areas throughout Guangdong Province. Workers in Shantou City sent letters to Guangzhou newspapers from afar, putting forward the goals and specific measures for learning from Xiang Xiuli's spirit. The Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory was also invited to send people to the Panyu People's Commune to report on Xiang Xiuli's deeds to more than 3,000 workers, farmers, and residents. Art groups and literary and art workers in Guangzhou, Foshan, Huiyang, and other places have also visited, collected, and sorted out the themes of Xiang Xiuli's deeds, and are creating songs, dances, dramas, Cantonese operas, and literary and artistic works, enthusiastically reflecting the growth process of this glorious life, and publicizing and praising her great communist virtues.

The Party and League organizations in Guangzhou have also given Xiang Xiuli a very high evaluation. As early as the end of January, the Propaganda Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee and the responsible persons and leading organs of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Communist Youth League called on Party and League organizations at all levels to carry out activities to learn from Xiang Xiuli, regarding it as a vivid and profound communist ideological education class, so as to absorb and inspire people's strength to move forward.

Recently, comrades Dong Biwu, Lin Boqu, Guo Moruo, and other leaders from the province and city who came to Guangzhou have also written poems and inscriptions to mourn this excellent daughter of the Party.

    向秀丽的精神深入人心
    广东人民学习向秀丽鼓起更大干劲
    本报广州6日电　被誉为党的好女儿，因舍身护厂、英勇牺牲的优秀共产党员向秀丽的崇高精神，正在广州人民群众中发生广泛深刻的影响。一个月来，已有八万多职工、学生和居民到向秀丽生前所在的何济公药厂表示悼念或听到有关她的事迹报告。人们纷纷表示要学习她的榜样。
    1月下旬广州的报纸发表的向秀丽为公忘私自我牺牲的光辉事迹，深深感动了广州各界人民群众。广州日报刚发表报道的第一天，就收到群众的来信、诗歌和文章二百多篇，表示悼念和要学习向秀丽的共产主义高尚风格。何济公药厂也收到各方面的同样内容的大量来信，同时，还有一批批群众来厂里向党支部和工会表示悼念，以及听有关向秀丽生平事迹的报告，或邀请党支部派人到本单位作报告。许多单位和学校开展了学习向秀丽的活动，人们还自动联系检查批判自己的个人主义思想，决心要学习向秀丽，提高思想觉悟，努力工作学习。广州钢铁厂的共青团员李永全，受到向秀丽的崇高精神的鼓励，在一个寒冷的晚上，带头冒着生命的危险跳到湍急而冰冷的珠江，抢救了一艘装满汽油正要爆炸的木船。
    学习向秀丽的活动，不仅大大促进了人们共产主义思想的成长，也鼓舞了人们以更大的干劲，积极搞好生产建设。广州全市工厂、商店和学校成百上千的突击队、车间、小组和班都以向秀丽命名，以向秀丽的精神来推动生产和工作。人们说：舍己为群向秀丽，英雄事迹永传世，人人学习向秀丽，社会主义早建成。有三百多职工的星群药厂，从领导到群众都根据向秀丽的精神深入联系检查个人思想工作，他们在批评督促别人时就说：“你有没有学习向秀丽的精神？”全厂职工在“向秀丽突击队”的帮助下，积极发挥干劲、钻劲，改进生产技术，在1月下旬短期内便扭转上半月的某些生产松劲情况，终于超额完成了1月份的月产值计划。何济公药厂职工们在提出要用实际行动悼念自己的亲密同伴后，各生产小组都在“向秀丽纪念栏”上贴了自己的跃进决心书，他们说：今后再闹个人主义，就要想想向秀丽是怎样牺牲的！向秀丽生前所在的化工车间工人正在努力采取新的生产措施，力争第一季度产量比前一季度提高一倍半，作为对她的悼念。
    向秀丽的崇高精神，在广东省各地城乡人民中也发生深刻的影响。汕头市的工人远道给广州报纸来信，提出了学习向秀丽精神的奋斗目标和具体措施。何济公药厂还应邀派人到番禺人民公社，向三千多职工、农民和居民报告向秀丽的事迹。广州、佛山、惠阳等地的艺术团体和文艺工作者，也纷纷在访问收集和整理向秀丽的事迹题材，进行创作歌舞、话剧、粤剧和文学、美术作品，热情地反映这个光辉生命的成长过程，宣扬歌颂她的共产主义的伟大品德。
    广州市的党、团组织也给予向秀丽以很高的评价。还在1月底，中共广州市委宣传部以及共青团广东省、广州市负责人和领导机关，就号召各级党团组织开展学习向秀丽的活动，把它当作一次生动深刻的共产主义思想教育课，从而吸取激勉人们前进的力量。
    近来到广州的董必武、林伯渠、郭沫若等同志和省、市党政领导人，也赋诗题词悼念这位党的优秀女儿。
