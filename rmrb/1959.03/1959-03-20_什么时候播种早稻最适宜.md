A common saying in the Jiangnan region goes: "Early rice sown early, second crop good." Why is there such a connection between them? This is because early sowing of early rice promotes early maturity and early harvest. Due to the early sowing and harvesting of early rice, late rice seedlings can be transplanted earlier, preventing the harm of low temperatures during flowering. If the daily average temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius during the flowering period of late rice, the sterility rate will significantly increase. Therefore, early sowing of early rice is a necessary condition for ensuring increased production of double-cropping rice.

However, how early should early rice be sown exactly? This is a complex question that is related to local weather conditions, varieties, seedling raising methods, cultivation methods, and pest and disease situations. Among these, special attention must be paid to local agricultural meteorological conditions.

Rice is a thermophilic crop, and the minimum temperature required for normal germination is 10 to 14 degrees Celsius. From the perspective of the biological characteristics of rice, during the period from sowing to the appearance of the second true leaf, the seedlings have not yet rooted well. If they encounter low temperatures or continuous rainy weather, they are susceptible to diseases such as cottony rot and damping-off, causing various phenomena of seedling decay. In order to meet the minimum temperature required for rice germination, the appropriate sowing period for early rice across the country can be when the average ground temperature at a depth of 10 centimeters in spring is stably at 12 degrees Celsius. For provinces such as Guangdong, southern Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan, the temperature will stably pass 12 degrees before “Rain Water”; in northern Fujian, southern Hunan and Jiangxi, and the Sichuan Basin, it will be around “Awakening of Insects”; in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, it will be between "Spring Equinox" and "Qingming." The actual sowing period in these regions in previous years was generally slightly later than the aforementioned periods.

Because the terrain varies from place to place, the microclimates of farmland are very inconsistent. At the same time, the selected varieties, soil texture, seedling raising methods, and cultivation techniques are also different. Therefore, the decision of when to sow early rice must be adapted to local conditions. (Agricultural Meteorology Research Office of the Central Meteorological Bureau)

    什么时候播种早稻最适宜
    江南流传着：“一造早，二造好”的农谚。为什么它们之间有这样联系呢？这是因为：早稻早播。促使早熟早收；由于早稻的早播早收，晚稻秧苗可以提早移栽，使开花时不致受到低温的危害。晚稻开花期间，如果日平均温度低于摄氏二十度，不实率便会显著增加。因此，早稻提早播种是保证双季稻增产的必要条件。
    但是早稻究竟应提早到什么时候播种呢？这是一个很复杂的问题，它与各地气象条件、品种、育秧方法、耕作方法、病虫害的情况等都有关系，其中必须引起特别注意的是各地农业气象条件。
    水稻是喜温作物，它正常发芽所要求的最低温度是摄氏十度到十四度。根据水稻的生物学特性来看，播种后到出现第二片真叶期间，秧苗还没有很好扎根，如遇低温或阴雨连绵的天气，易受绵腐病、立枯病的危害，造成各种烂秧现象。为了满足水稻发芽时所要求的最低温度，可以在用春季十厘米平均地温稳定在摄氏十二度深处的时候，作为全国各地早稻的适宜播种期。就广东、闽南、广西、云南等省来看，在
  “雨水”以前就先后稳定通过十二度；闽北、湘赣南部和四川盆地一带，大致在“惊蛰”前后；长江中下游和川北、陕南各地大致在“春分”与“清明”之间。这些地区往年实际的播种期一般略比上述时期为晚。
    因为各地地形复杂，农田小气候很不一致，同时选用的品种、土壤的质地，以及育秧方法、耕作技术等也有不同，因此决定水稻早播的时间，必须因地制宜。（中央气象局农业气象研究室）
