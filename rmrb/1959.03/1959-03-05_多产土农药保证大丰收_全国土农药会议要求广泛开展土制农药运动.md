Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Indigenous pesticides will play a greater role in guaranteeing bumper harvests of crops this year. The plan formulated at the recently concluded National Indigenous Pesticide Conference indicates that in order to control crop diseases and insect pests, and to ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production, the demand for pesticides this year will be greater than last year. In addition to the chemical pesticides supplied by the state, about two-thirds will rely on indigenous pesticides manufactured by the masses themselves.

    This conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Commerce and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The conference called on all regions to extensively launch a campaign to produce indigenous pesticides. According to statistics from this conference, the indigenous pesticides produced in various regions last year, including single-use agents and compound agents, totaled more than 500 types, which played a significant role in ensuring last year's bumper crop. Indigenous pesticides are not only effective, but also very low in cost because they utilize wild plants extracted locally, which can save expenses.

    Indigenous pesticides and indigenous fertilizers are both products of the masses' daring to think and act during last year's Great Leap Forward. Last year, while farmers in various regions were trial-producing indigenous fertilizers, they also developed the experience of using tobacco stalks, lime, and other methods to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, and sought and tried to use more wild plants to manufacture pesticides. The news that Chairman Mao instructed everyone in Sichuan to promote the use of "Broken Bowl Flower" to kill mosquitoes and flies was transmitted to various places, which gave the masses great inspiration. Party committees in various regions also gave active support and leadership to the demands of the masses, and the movement to produce indigenous pesticides was launched vigorously. Agricultural, industrial, commercial, and scientific research departments have all made efforts to promote this movement and have closely cooperated.

    This year's production is to have a greater leap forward, and more pesticides are needed to carry out plant protection work. The Ministry of Commerce and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly convened the National Indigenous Pesticide Conference to arrange the collection, manufacture, and scientific research of indigenous pesticides this year as early as possible. The conference called on all regions to formulate plans at all levels, rationally arrange labor, grasp the timing of disease and insect pest control, and the season for collecting medicinal materials, so that this year's production of indigenous pesticides will be more and better than last year. The conference emphasized that while continuing to explore plant sources of medicine this year, special attention should be paid to making more use of mineral resources to manufacture indigenous pesticides. Some plants with higher efficacy and smaller quantities should be cultivated in a planned way to expand the source of medicine. In terms of scientific research, the conference called on all regions to strengthen the variety identification of plant pesticides, research on collection, processing, use, and storage, and to unify methods for measuring efficacy, research on the refining and purification of indigenous pesticides, so that indigenous pesticides can continuously improve quality on the basis of popularization and develop in the direction of "indigenous in the soil, foreign in effect". The conference also emphasized that safety must be paid attention to during the transportation, storage, and use of pesticides to prevent poisoning accidents.

    At this meeting, the issue of preventing and controlling wheat rust was also discussed in detail, and a plan for the use of medicines for preventing and controlling rust was formulated. The meeting believes that guaranteeing a bumper wheat harvest is of great significance for realizing this year's grain production increase plan. Due to the high winter temperatures and high soil moisture, which are suitable for the spread of wheat rust, the supply of pesticides must be fully prepared. (Attached picture)

### 多产土农药保证大丰收  全国土农药会议要求广泛开展土制农药运动

    多产土农药保证大丰收
    全国土农药会议要求广泛开展土制农药运动
    据新华社4日讯　土制农药将在今年保证农作物丰收上起更大的作用。在最近结束的全国土农药会议所订的规划表明，为除治农作物的病虫灾害，保证农业生产的更大跃进，今年农药需用量比去年更大，除了国家供应的化学农药以外，三分之二左右将依靠群众自己制造的土农药。
    这次会议是由商业部和中国科学院联合召开的。会议要求各地广泛开展土制农药的运动。根据这次会议的统计，去年各地生产的土农药包括单用剂和合制剂共达五百多种，对保证去年农作物丰收起了很大作用。土农药不仅效果好，并且由于利用野生植物就地提炼，成本很低，可以节省费用。
    土农药和土化肥都是去年大跃进中群众敢想敢干的产物。去年各地农民在试制土化肥的同时，并发展了历来利用烟筋、石灰等防治作物病虫害的经验，寻找和试用更多的野生植物来制造农药。毛主席在四川指示大家推广“打破碗花花”杀灭蚊蝇的消息传到各地后，更给予了群众以极大的启示。各地党委对群众的要求也给予积极的支持和领导，大搞土农药的运动便热火朝天开展起来了。农业、工业、商业和科学研究等部门都对促进这个运动作了努力，并且进行了密切协作。
    今年生产要有更大的跃进，需要更多的农药来进行植物保护工作。商业部和中国科学院联合召开全国土农药会议，就是为了及早安排今年土农药的采集、制造和科学研究等工作。会议要求各地层层订出规划，合理安排劳动力，掌握住防治病虫害的时机和采药季节，让今年的土农药生产比去年更多更好。会议强调今年在继续发掘植物药源的同时，要特别注意多利用矿物资源来制造土农药。有些药效较高、数量较少的植物，要有计划地进行栽培以扩大药源。在科学研究方面，会议要求各地加强对植物农药的品种鉴定，采集、加工、使用、储藏的研究等，并要统一药效测定方法，研究土农药的精制和提纯，使土农药在普及的基础上不断提高质量，向土中出洋的方向发展。会议还强调了在农药的运输、保管、使用过程中必须注意安全，防止发生中毒事故。
    这次会上还着重讨论了有关防治小麦锈病的问题，并且订出了防治锈病的用药规划。会议认为，保证小麦大丰收对实现今年粮食增产计划具有重大意义。由于冬季气温高，土壤湿度较大，适于小麦锈病的传播，因此农药供应必须有充分的准备。（附图片）
