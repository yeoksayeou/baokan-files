    Gifts for the Commune
    On the fourth day of the first lunar month, just as dawn was breaking, more than 800 workers and family members from the Yichang City Construction Company in Hubei, led by Deputy Party Secretary Mao Yunfeng, formed a fertilizer-delivery army, transporting the large amount of fertilizer accumulated by the workers during the Spring Festival holiday. They crossed the Yangtze River from the Eighth Pier and headed straight for the Qilichong Brigade of the Dianjun Commune, to wish their farmer brothers a happy Spring Festival.

    In the fertilizer-delivery team, there were elderly workers as well as children who were only a little over ten years old; there were nearly a hundred couples delivering fertilizer, and dozens of families, both adults and children, were out in full force. Comrade Deng Dahai's family of four didn't want anyone to be left behind. His two children, who were only a little over ten years old, also went with the group to deliver fertilizer. Comrade Han Qijun carried a full load of fertilizer. Because it was too heavy, the carrying pole broke not far after he left. The comrades wanted to share his fertilizer, but he refused no matter what. Later, he ran back and found a more solid carrying pole, picked up the heavy load, and quickly caught up with the advancing team.

    As soon as the fertilizer-delivery army entered Qilichong, they heard the sounds of gongs and drums and firecrackers. The enthusiastic welcome from the farmer brothers further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. Comrade Chen Qifu, an old worker who arrived earlier, put down his load and immediately came back to greet the people behind him. But no one was willing to let him share their load. Comrade Xu Guode, who was walking at the back, attracted a lot of attention. When he set off from the company, he was carrying a load of slag fertilizer, but when he arrived at the Qilichong Brigade, it had turned into a load of dry manure piled high. Everyone couldn't help but feel a little strange and hurriedly asked what was going on. It turned out that on the way, as soon as Old Xu saw manure by the roadside, he picked it up, picking as he walked. By the time he carried it to his destination, the baskets were piled high.

    The workers' delivery of fertilizer to the countryside gave the farmer brothers great encouragement. They expressed that they would use practical actions of doing a good job in agricultural production and striving for an even greater harvest to thank the support of the worker elder brothers.

    送给公社的礼物
    农历正月初四，天刚蒙蒙亮。湖北宜昌市建筑公司的八百多个职工和家属，在党委副书记毛云峰的领导下，组成一支送肥大军，运送着职工们在春节假期中积起的大量肥料。他们从八码头渡了江，直向点军公社七里冲大队进发，去向农民兄弟贺春节。
    送肥队伍中，有年老工人，也有才十多岁的小孩；有近百对的夫妻送肥，也有几十户全家大小都出动了的。邓大海同志全家四口人，谁也不愿留下，他的两个小孩都才十多岁，也跟大伙儿一起去送肥。韩启俊同志挑了满满一担肥料，由于太重，刚出门不远，就把扁担压断了。同志们要分担他的肥料，但怎么说他也不干。以后，他又跑回去找了一根更牢实的扁担，挑起沉重的担子，很快地赶上了前进的队伍。
    送肥大军一进入七里冲，就听到锣鼓声和鞭炮声，农民兄弟的热情欢迎，更加鼓舞了大家的干劲。到的较早的老工人陈启富同志，把担子一放，马上又回来迎接后面的人。可是谁也不肯把自己的担子让给他。走在最后面的许国德同志，很引起人们的注意。在公司出发时，他挑的是一担渣肥，但到了七里冲大队，却变成了一担尖尖的干大粪。大家不觉有些奇怪，忙问是怎么回事。原来老许在路上，一见路旁有大粪，就把它拣了起来，边走边拣，等挑到目的地时，箩筐里就堆得尖尖的了。
    工人送肥下乡，给农民兄弟以极大的鼓舞，他们表示要用搞好农业生产，争取更大丰收的实际行动，来感谢工人老大哥的支援。
