Luo Er Mei leads a group of female workers in "herding sheep" on the Wu River in Guangdong Province. Sometimes she stands on a light wooden raft specially designed for "herding sheep," and sometimes she wades in the water, using a bamboo pole with an iron hook to pull the timber that has drifted to the shore into the faster-flowing part of the river, letting the river carry it away.

Since the first "herding sheep" operation on the Wu River last November, Luo Er Mei has participated alongside the male workers. She has been indispensable ever since, and this is her fourth time.

In the initial "herding sheep" operation, they didn't know how to do it. Unrestrained individual logs blocked the way in the narrow beach, and more and more timber piled up behind, stacked haphazardly, higher and higher. They called it "forming a shed." At one point, a large "shed" formed, and it took Luo Er Mei and several other female workers a full hour to clear the blockage. Learning from experience, later, when she saw a place where a "shed" might form, she would send people ahead to clear the way for the timber. Now, the occurrence of "sheds" is rare, and large "sheds" are even rarer.

Due to the mountainous terrain here, southerly winds can blow even in winter. When the southerly wind comes, the timber drifts upstream with the wind, making transportation difficult. At this time, Luo Er Mei and everyone would think of ways to pull the timber downstream forcefully with cables on both banks. Sometimes, when the southerly wind blew during the day, making it difficult to "herd sheep," they would take advantage of the moonlight at night to work overtime and drive the timber a long distance.

Once, during a heavy snowfall, the river water was bitterly cold. In order to transport the "sheep," she jumped into the river to operate. Before long, the snow water had completely numbed her legs. During the days of "herding sheep" in winter, her legs dealt with the river water every day, and cracks opened on the skin of her feet, but she never succumbed to the difficulties.

### 骆二妹在武江上

    骆二妹在武江上
    骆二妹率领着一群女工在广东省武江上“赶羊”。她时而站在专为“赶羊”而设的轻快的木排上，时而泡在水中，用带铁钩的竹竿，把冲到岸边的木材钩到水流较急的地方，让河水带下去。
    从去年11月武江第一次“赶羊”时起，骆二妹就跟着男工一起参加了，以后每次都离不了她，这回是第四次了。
    最初那次“赶羊”，她们不懂得怎样做，一条条无拘无束的散木在狭窄的滩头堵住去路，后面越来越多的木材横七竖八地架叠起来，愈叠愈高，她们管它叫结棚。有一处结了一个大大的棚，骆二妹和几个女工足足花了一个多钟头才算把堵塞的木材疏通。经一事长一智，以后，看什么地方可能会结棚，她就先派人去为木材开路。现在结棚的事已经很少，大棚更是没有。
    这里由于山岭的形势，在冬天也会吹起南风。南风一来，木材就会随风逆流而上，使放运发生困难。这时骆二妹就和大家想办法在两岸牵着缆把木材用力拉下。有时日间吹南风，不好“赶羊”，她们就趁夜间的月色开夜工来赶，也把木材赶了很远的路程。
    有一次，下大雪，河水冰冷刺骨。她为了赶运“羊群”，就跳到江里操作。不多久，雪水就把她两条腿全麻痹了。在冬天“赶羊”的日子里，她的双腿天天都和河水打交道，脚皮上开了裂纹，可是她从来没有向困难屈服过。
