Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 25th: Zhao Fengxiang, the chief culprit in the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu, was executed in Changsha City on the 24th.

In June and July of 1946, secret service chief and Kuomintang Yunnan Provincial Garrison Commander Huo Kuizhang actively carried out Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy of so-called "secret sanctions" against Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, and others. He instructed Wang Ziming, the chief of the Investigation Division, to convene secret service core members Zhao Fengxiang (secret service team leader), Cui Zhensan (team leader), Cai Yunqi (chief of the Kuomintang Kunming City Defense Command Intelligence Team), and others for a meeting to secretly plan the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. Subsequently, Zhao Fengxiang dispatched secret service agents to specifically monitor the movements of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. On the afternoon of July 11th of the same year, Zhao Fengxiang, leading secret service agents Tang Shiliang, Wu Boyun, and others, ambushed and shot Mr. Li Gongpu as he was returning home. Mr. Li Gongpu died in the hospital the next day due to his serious injuries. Afterwards, the secret service agency gave these perpetrators large amounts of "bonuses," and Zhao Fengxiang was promoted from Captain to Major.

The criminal Zhao Fengxiang was from Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. From 1943 to 1949, he successively served as a member and team leader of the intelligence team of the "Investigation Office" of the Kuomintang Army Headquarters and the Yunnan Garrison Command Investigation Division, and as the deputy director of the Intelligence Office of the Fourth District Commissioner's Office of Hubei Province. In May 1949, the criminal Zhao sneaked back to Xiangtan from Shashi, Hubei, fabricated his history, and concealed his crimes for a long time. In the first half of 1958, he was finally exposed through mass accusations and investigations by public security organs. After the criminal Zhao was arrested by the Xiangtan County Public Security Bureau, he had no choice but to confess his crimes in the face of conclusive evidence. The Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court sentenced the criminal Zhao to death according to law, and with the approval of the Supreme People's Court, he was executed by firing squad in Changsha City on the 24th.

    杀害李公朴的主凶赵凤祥伏法
    新华社长沙25日电　杀害李公朴先生的主凶赵凤祥24日在长沙市伏法。
    1946年6、7月间，特务头子、国民党云南省警备司令霍揆彰积极执行蒋介石对李公朴、闻一多等进行所谓“秘密制裁”的阴谋，指使稽查处处长王子明召集特务骨干分子赵凤祥（特务组长）、崔镇三（组长）、蔡云旗（国民党昆明市城防司令部谍报组组长）等开会，秘密布置刺杀李公朴、闻一多。以后，赵凤祥即派特务分子专门监视李公朴和闻一多的行踪。同年7月11日下午，赵凤祥带领特务分子汤世良、吴博云等，趁李公朴先生外出返家的时候，开枪袭击，第二天李公朴先生因伤重在医院逝世。事后，特务机关发给了这些凶犯大批“奖金”，赵凤祥并由上尉被提升为少校。
    赵犯凤祥是湖南省湘潭县人。1943年至1949年间曾先后担任国民党陆军总部“调查室”和云南警备司令部稽查处的谍报组组员、组长，国民党湖北省第四区专员公署情报室副主任等职务。1949年5月赵犯由湖北沙市潜回湘潭后，伪造历史，长期隐瞒自己的罪恶。1958年上半年，在群众检举和公安机关侦察下终被清查出来。赵犯经湘潭县公安局逮捕后，在确凿的证据面前，不得不供认了自己的罪行。湖南省高级人民法院依法判处赵犯死刑，并经最高人民法院批准，24日在长沙市执行枪决。
