Experimental Plots are High-Yield Models

Guangdong Leaders at All Levels Vigorously Grasp the Early Rice Large-Area High-Yield Experimental Plot Movement

(Our newspaper Guangzhou, March 27th) Guangdong Province is using the successful experience of organizing the great leap forward in rice production last year to carry out a province-wide early rice large-area high-yield experimental plot movement to ensure a greater leap forward in early rice this year.

This year, Guangdong Province has launched early rice large-area high-yield experimental plot activities from the beginning of spring plowing. Early rice experimental plots, early rice high-yield areas, Red and Expert Girls' Fields, and Little Heroes' Fields have sprung up everywhere like mushrooms after rain. At present, the scale and number of people involved in this movement far exceed those of last year. According to incomplete statistics from the Shantou and Zhanjiang Special Zones, and the Jiangmen, Shaoguan, and Foshan Special Zones, there are more than 3 million mu of early rice high-yield experimental plots. Among them, the Shantou and Zhanjiang Special Zones account for more than 20% of the basic farmland area for early rice. The Jiangmen Special Zone is as high as 33%. Approximately millions of cadres from Party committees at all levels, various departments, communes, management districts, and production teams, as well as youths and women, have invested in the experimental plot movement. It is estimated that the high-yield experimental plots planted throughout the province this year account for approximately 20% to 30% of the basic farmland for early rice. A dense and interconnected network of experimental plots, mainly for early rice, has been formed throughout the province.

This year's early rice experimental plots generally focus on grain, but there are also large-area high-yield experimental plots in the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. For these experimental plots, all regions have formulated advanced targets and specific and effective measures based on the spirit of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis. The yield requirement is one to several times higher than that of basic farmland.

A major feature of the large-area high-yield experimental plots operated in various regions this year is the universal attention to the principle of economic accounting, striving for low investment and high yield. For example, the million mu of early rice high-yield experimental plots operated in the Zhanjiang Special Zone not only require a significant increase in yield compared to basic farmland, but also require that the input of labor and means of production, and the expenditure of production funds, be similar or slightly more than those of basic farmland. Various regions also pay attention to improving labor efficiency by vigorously carrying out tool reforms, improving labor organization, and launching agricultural technology revolutions, to ensure the quality of work.

Currently, the experimental plots throughout the province have entered the busy season of spring plowing. The rice seedlings planted in Hainan Island, the Leizhou Peninsula, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chaoshan Plain, where the season is earlier, are growing very well.

In order to make the large-area high-yield experimental plots truly play a demonstrative and promoting role, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over the experimental plot work, universally established professional teams with cadres as the core, established scientific labor management and production responsibility systems, and carried out evaluation and competition activities.

    试验田是高产标兵
    广东各级领导狠抓早稻大面积高产试验田运动
    本报广州27日电　广东省各地运用去年组织水稻生产大跃进的成功经验，在全省范围内开展了以早造水稻大面积高产试验田运动，确保今年早造更大跃进。
    今年，广东省从备耕开始，就开展了早稻大面积高产试验田活动，早稻试验田、早稻丰产片、红专姑娘田、小英雄田，如雨后春笋，到处涌现。目前，这个运动规模之大，人数之多，远远超过去年。据汕头、湛江专区和江门、韶关、佛山专区的不完全统计，早稻高产试验田达三百多万亩。其中，汕头、湛江专区约占早稻基本农田面积的20％以上。江门专区高达33％以上。投入试验田运动的有各级党委、各部门、各公社、管理区、生产队的干部以及青年、妇女等群众约数百万人。据估计，全省今年种植的高产试验田约占早造基本农田的20％到30％，一个以早稻为主的星罗棋布、纵横交错的试验田网已在全省范围内形成。
    今年早造试验田一般以粮食为主，同时，农林牧副渔五业也有大面积高产试验田。对于这些试验田，各地都根据冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的精神，制定了先进的指标和具体有效措施，产量要求比基本农田高一倍到几倍。
    今年各地经营的大面积高产试验田的一个重大特点，是普遍注意经济核算原则，力求投资少而产量高。如湛江专区经营的百万亩早造高产试验田，不仅要求产量要比基本农田大大增加，而且也要求在劳动力和生产资料的投放、生产资金的开支等方面，都与基本农田差不多或稍多一点。各地还注意从大搞工具改革、改善劳动组织和开展农业技术革命等方面来提高劳动效率，保证工作质量。
    现在，全省各地的试验田已进入春耕大忙阶段。节季较早的海南岛、雷州半岛、珠江三角洲、潮汕平原一带已插下的秧苗都长得很好。
    为使大面积高产试验田真正起到示范和促进作用，各级党委都加强了对试验田工作的领导，普遍成立以干部为核心的专业队伍，建立科学的劳动管理和生产责任制度，并开展评比竞赛活动。（杨文全）
