    Less is More
    Xue Yangyu
    The stagecraft of the play "Farewell My Concubine," performed by the China Youth Art Theater, is unique. Perhaps I have seen too few plays, but it is indeed the first time I have seen stage settings as concise and clear, yet so full of character, as in "Farewell My Concubine." Take Wang Zhongyuan's home, for example. In a typical treatment, the home of such a pseudo-bank manager would definitely be decorated in a luxurious and dazzling manner. But here, we only see a few items such as a table, chairs, a bookshelf, and a radio. However, we still feel that it is a well-stocked and extravagant house. This is because the furnishings on the stage are not dispensable objects, but are carefully designed and selected by the artists. They have vivid and clear generalizations, which inspire the audience's imagination. The bookshelf is particularly characteristic. When the audience first sees Wang Zhongyuan's home (Scene 3), they first see the bookshelf neatly filled with thick, hardcover books, with one book conspicuously missing. This bookshelf plays a significant role in the conflicts that unfold between the characters, illustrating that Wang Zhongyuan does not really want to read these books ("The Complete Works of Lu Xun," etc.). Later, when Wang Zhongyuan betrays the country and defects to the enemy, we see this home for the second time (Scene 13). The furnishings have not been added to, but the bookshelf, which attracted attention in the third scene, now holds Wang Zhongyuan's mistress Yu Fangzi's (a traitor) various strangely shaped high-heeled shoes. Without verbose explanations, the change of just one bookshelf is enough to indicate the extent of Wang Zhongyuan's depravity.
    The originality of the stagecraft in "Farewell My Concubine" makes me think that the sets of some plays are too cumbersome and extravagant. They seem to want to move everything from real life onto the stage without leaving anything out. Some are so complex that the audience's eyes are not enough to take it all in, and in order to understand the environment, they cannot quickly focus their attention on the activities of the characters in the play.
    My intention is not to generally oppose the use of more sets and props, but to feel that all the devices on the stage, even the smallest thing, should strictly follow the needs of the plot, be carefully selected, and typically highlight the specific qualities of certain objects that should be in a specific environment. We must "achieve more with less."

    以少胜多
    薛养玉
    中国青年艺术剧院上演的话剧“丽人行”，在舞台美术的创造上是别具风格的。也许我看的话剧太少，像“丽人行”中陈设那么简洁明了，却又那么富有特征，确乎还是头一次。就拿王仲原的家来说，按一般的处理，像这么个伪银行经理的家，一定非装饰得富丽堂皇，叫人眼花撩乱不可。但在这里，我们看到的只不过是桌、椅、书架、收音机几样东西，然而我们还是感到它是一个应有尽有的阔绰的屋子。这就是因为舞台上的陈设，不是些可有可无的物件，而是经过了艺术家们的匠心设计和选择。它们有着生动鲜明的概括性，启发了观众的联想力。特别富有特征的是那个书架。当观众第一次看到王仲原的家时（第三场），首先看到那个整齐地摆满了厚厚的精装书的书架，其中又显眼地少了一本书。就是这个书架，在人物间展开的冲突上，起了不小的作用，说明了王仲原并不是真的要看这些书（“鲁迅全集”等）；在以后，王仲原变节投敌了，我们又第二次看到了这个家室（第十三场），陈设并未多添什么，只是这个曾在第三场中惹人注意的书架，放的已是王仲原的情妇俞芳子（汉奸）的各种各样奇形怪状的高跟鞋。不用絮絮叨叨，仅一个书架的变化，就已经表明王仲原堕落的程度。
    “丽人行”的舞台美术上的这种独创性，使我想到有些戏的布景，实在太繁琐、太铺张了。他们似乎恨不得把现实生活中一切都无遗漏地搬上舞台，有的庞杂得使观众的眼睛不够用，为了弄清环境，而不能使人很快地把全神贯注到剧中人的活动上。
    我的意思，并不是一般地反对多用布景和道具，而是觉得舞台上的一切装置，那怕很小的一点东西，都应该严格地服从剧情的需要，精于选择，典型地突出某个具体环境中应该有的某种物件特质来。要“以少胜多”。
