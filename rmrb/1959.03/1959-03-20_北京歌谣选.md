    Workers' Strength is Limitless
    Workers' strength is limitless,
    Holding up the blue sky with both hands,
    Dispatching the sun, moon, and stars,
    Commanding wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning,
    Leading six hundred million people,
    To realize the Party's line.
    Workers' strength is boundless,
    Controlling machines with both hands,
    The East Sea can be filled,
    Mount Tai can be uprooted,
    Leading six hundred million people,
    Towards Communism.
    (Li Jimei, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant)
      The People Have the Communist Party
    Workers have always loved to sing,
    A thousand sing, ten thousand echo;
    One sings feudalism into the grave,
    Two sings exploitation into the river.
    The people have the Communist Party,
    Singing triumphant songs joyfully;
    Singing satellites to spin across the sky,
    Singing flowers never to wither.
    (Wang Shu, Capital Machinery Factory Worker)
      Chairman Mao's Soldiers
    Iron horses gallop bravely,
    Thunder rumbles at the foot of the mountain.
    Through trenches and over shell holes,
    All obstacles are swept away.
    May I ask, whose children are you?
    "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers!"
      (Shen Yingzhou, Beijing Troops)
      Construction Site Lights
    No Milky Way, only a river of lights,
    The river of lights flows over mountain slopes,
    Thousands of people carry earth up the slopes,
    Like flying boats crossing the Milky Way.
    (Zhang Zubin, Thirteen Tombs Reservoir Construction Site)
      The Chief Checks the Ditches Every Night
    The moon has come out,
    The chief has arrived.
    He carries a shovel,
    He walks along the ditch,
    In the moonlight,
    Walking and looking.
    The ditch water is lush green,
    The ditch bank is long and strong.
    He carries a shovel,
    He walks along the ditch,
    In the moonlight,
    Looking and smiling.
    Dry land turns into paddy fields,
    Water is the treasure of treasures,
    To prevent water from running away,
    The chief checks the ditches every night.
    (Dongba Township, Chaoyang District)
      Releasing Water Ballad
    Water is singing,
    People are laughing, water runs in the ditch,
    People jump on the bank. Beating drums, setting off firecrackers,
    We have captured the Dragon King.
    (Jiao Zhixin, Baishuiwa Township, Changping District)
        Riding Golden Clouds to the Azure Sky
    High mountains are inserted among colorful clouds,
    Terraced fields rise straight up the mountain,
    When the wheat turns yellow,
    Riding golden clouds to the azure sky.
     (Dashangu, Mentougou District)

    北京歌谣选
    工人力大无边
    工人力大无边，
    双手托住青天，
    调度日月星辰，
    指挥风云雷电，
    带动六亿人民，
    实现党的路线。
    工人力大无比，
    双手掌握机器，
    东海可以填平，
    泰山能够拔起，
    带动六亿人民，
    走向共产主义。	（石景山钢铁厂  刘寄梅）
      人民有了共产党
    工人从来爱唱歌，
    千人唱来万人和；
    一唱封建进坟墓，
    二唱剥削抛江河。
    人民有了共产党，
    欢天喜地唱凯歌；
    唱得卫星满天转，
    唱得常年花不落。	（首都机械厂工人   王术）
      毛主席的兵
    铁马英勇奔腾，
    大山脚下雷鸣。
    穿过战壕过弹坑，
    所有障碍都扫平。
    借问谁家子弟？
    “我们是毛主席的兵！”
      （北京部队申迎洲）
      工地灯火
    不见银河见灯河，
    灯河流过群山坡，
    千人挑土坡上走，
    好似飞舟过银河。	（十三陵水库工地  张祖彬）
      社长夜夜查渠道
    月亮出来了，
    社长走来了。
    他扛着铁锹，
    他沿着水渠，
    在月光中，
    边走边瞧。
    渠水绿悠悠，
    渠堤长又牢。
    他扛着铁锹，
    他沿着水渠，
    在月光中，
    边瞧边笑。
    旱地变水田，
    水是宝中宝，
    为了不跑水，
    社长夜夜查渠道。
    （朝阳区东坝乡）
      放水谣
    水在歌，
    人在笑，水在渠中跑，
    人在堤上跳。敲锣鼓，放鞭炮，
    咱们把龙王擒来了。	（昌平区白水洼乡  焦志新）
        驾着金云上青天
    高山插在彩云间，
    梯田一直升上山，
    等到麦子转了黄，
    驾着金云上青天。 	 （门头沟区  大山谷）
