    Close Planting is the Central Link in Peanut High Yield
    Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    Peanut is one of China's major oil crops. Although the yield per unit area and total output have increased year by year since liberation, they still fail to fully meet the needs. In 1958, under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, although peanuts were affected by the spring drought, which restricted the planting area and even delayed the sowing date, they still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The yield per unit area was about 138.5% of that in 1957, and the total output increased by about one time.
    Breaking through the density barrier was a key technical measure for the bumper peanut harvest in 1958. In the past, it was generally believed that peanut cultivation should rely on multiple branches to produce more flowers and fruits. When the density increases, the number of branches will inevitably decrease, and the corresponding number of flowering parts will also decrease. Therefore, close planting was not promoted. This statement makes some sense when the soil fertility is low, but people's perception of close planting has been affected to a certain extent as a result.
    In fact, the yield-increasing effect of density varies with the amount of fertilizer applied and the supply of soil moisture. According to the experience of bumper harvests in 1958, the relationship between the number of plants and the yield is roughly ten to one (ten peanut plants yield one jin). This shows that it is necessary to create high yields on a certain density basis. In order to achieve high-yield targets, there must be corresponding fertilizers and moisture to ensure better growth and fruiting of plants. In large-scale production, ordinary clustered large peanuts can have 18,000 to 25,000 plants per mu, and pearl-type peanuts can be slightly increased to ensure a yield of about 2,000 jin. Row spacing of about one chi can be used, with three seeds sown per hole or equidistant wide-row single-seed drilling (wide strip planting), but strip planting has a significant yield-increasing effect.
    The most appropriate planting density should ensure the best growth of plant economic traits and achieve the highest yield under the conditions of fully utilizing space and soil fertility. Therefore, the central issue of peanut high yield is actually the coordination of several major links centered on close planting.
    1. Grade and select seeds, sow at the right time, soak seeds and promote germination to ensure full and strong seedlings.
    In order to ensure the rational distribution of plants, in addition to the amount of seeds sown and the method of sowing, how to maintain complete and vigorous seedlings is a necessary means to achieve the goal of increasing yield through close planting. If there are many missing seedlings, although the requirements for close planting are met at the time of sowing, the purpose of increasing yield through close planting cannot actually be achieved. In order to have complete and vigorous seedlings, attention should be paid to the harvesting, storage, drying, shelling, and grading and selection of peanut seeds. Sowing seeds of the same grade (seeds of the same quality) in the same plot will inevitably result in similar growth, which can avoid mutual interference, which is especially important in the case of high-density planting.
    Peanut germination requires a relatively high temperature. If the soil temperature is insufficient, emergence will often be delayed for a long time and will be very uneven. Soaking seeds and promoting germination before sowing will not only result in early emergence but also uniform emergence.
    Early sowing can extend the growing period, which is more important for peanuts with dispersed flowering periods. The most appropriate sowing period should be determined according to the local temperature, terrain, and soil quality. In the North China region, it is generally appropriate around "Lixia" (Beginning of Summer), and small peanuts can be sown slightly earlier.
    2. Control water during the seedling stage to promote the deep development of the root system; apply top dressing and watering at the right time to promote more flowers and early pods.
    In the past, peanuts were usually cultivated on dry land, and management was extensive, so yields were always low. But the facts have proved that peanuts are very easy to obtain high yields under irrigated conditions. The number of waterings should be determined according to natural conditions, generally more than three times. The first time should be in the late seedling stage during the rounding stage, which is when flower buds are differentiating in large numbers. Watering in conjunction with top dressing can promote flower bud differentiation, increase the number of flowers, and promote uniform flowering. After that, watering can be combined with top dressing according to rainfall and soil moisture conditions; however, it should be ensured that the plants are not drought-stressed until most of the fruit pegs have entered the soil.
    Generally, it takes about fifty to sixty days for a large peanut pod to mature from flowering, and a little shorter for a small peanut. Therefore, a series of measures to promote flowering should be completed about two months before harvesting. During this period, since the fruit pegs have basically all entered the soil and the temperature is gradually decreasing, the soil moisture should be appropriately controlled and the irrigation interval should be extended to increase the soil temperature. If too much water is irrigated at this time, it will not only delay the time for the pods to expand and fill, but also increase the rate of shriveled pods; and because the humidity is too high, it will also have an adverse effect on the mature pods.
    The peanut seedling grows slowly, but the root system expands quickly, so the seedlings have strong drought resistance, and at the same time, in relatively dry conditions, it is more conducive to the root system developing in depth.
    3. Increase the application of base fertilizer, use more phosphate and potash fertilizer, and promote rhizobium inoculation.
    In the past, people mistakenly believed that peanuts were suitable for growing on barren land and did not need a lot of fertilizer, especially because of the symbiotic effect of rhizobia, so it was even more unsuitable to apply nitrogen fertilizer. According to analysis, the amount of fertilizer required by peanuts is very large. Under general production conditions, assuming the ratio of dry grass to pods is one to one, then every 1,000 jin of peanuts produced requires about 55 jin of nitrogen, 10 jin of phosphorus, and 30 jin of potassium.
    According to the high-yield experience in various places in 1958, for peanuts with a yield of 1,000 to 2,000 jin per mu, the application of local miscellaneous fertilizer should not be less than 20,000 jin, and 20 to 30 jin of superphosphate and 300 to 500 jin of plant ash should also be applied; some slow-release fertilizers should also be applied during the fruiting period to facilitate pod development. In 1958, many areas combined soil cultivation with the application of some soil manure during the peanut growing period, which had a great effect on promoting pod maturity and fullness. Peanut flower buds differentiate very early. If about 20 jin of ammonium sulfate can be applied before the start of flowering or quick-acting farm fertilizer can be applied in stages, it will have a very significant effect on promoting flowering and fruiting. In order to ensure the yield-increasing effect of rhizobia, attention should be paid to the rational use method.
    Peanuts have a high requirement for calcium, especially when applying lime on acidic soils can not only neutralize the soil acidity, but also ensure a sufficient supply of calcium, promote pod development; if calcium is lacking, empty pods or shriveled pods will be produced.
    4. Deep plowing can promote root development and lay a solid foundation for growth.
    According to many years of experience, old farmers in peanut-producing areas believe that peanuts like raw soil and are not suitable for continuous cropping; but when continuously cropped, deep plowing and "importing soil" can also offset the adverse effects of continuous cropping. This is because deep plowing and "importing soil" supplement the nutrients that were heavily consumed by the previous peanut crop, and also create a deep, loose soil layer, which is conducive to water and fertilizer retention, and is also more conducive to the activity of soil microorganisms.
    The depth of plowing varies greatly depending on the soil quality in various places. In addition to high-yield cultivation, which can be determined according to the needs, general sandy loam or sandy soil can be plowed to a depth of one to one and a half chi depending on the manpower conditions.
    5. Varieties and cultivation.
    The range of peanut high yields in 1958 was very wide, so the high-yield varieties were also very complex, including ordinary clustered large peanuts or prostrate peanuts, as well as pearl-type small peanuts. These varieties have significant differences in botanical morphology, and the fruiting sites are also different. Because the masses in various places have clarified the characteristics of the varieties based on years of accumulated experience, they can meet the requirements of the biological characteristics of a particular variety in terms of density and field management arrangements. Therefore, any variety type can create high yields. Some people once said that pearl-type small peanuts have concentrated fruiting and are suitable for close planting, so it is a high-yield cultivation type. However, ordinary clustered large peanuts with dispersed fruiting also achieved high yields last year under people's hard work. These facts powerfully destroyed the conditional theory of some people.
    The variety type has little to do with high yield. The key to whether or not there is a high yield lies in determining the appropriate density and corresponding field management methods according to the characteristics of the variety. Of course, this does not mean ignoring or negating the high-yield traits of the variety. The varieties used in high-yield production in various places in 1958 were all the best local farm varieties retained after years of selection and elimination. For example, the "Zhongliuqiu" variety is cultivated on a large area in Nan'an, Fujian, and almost all of the peanuts planted in Hong'an, Hubei, are Hong'an erect peanuts.
    Based on these situations, in the large-scale peanut production in 1959, various places should focus on selecting two or three varieties from the local farm varieties that are suitable for growing in different regions, and formulate corresponding density quotas, fertilization conditions, and management methods for each variety to prepare for the peanut bumper harvest in 1959.
    6. Ensure clean fields and loose soil; carry out topping and soil cultivation to promote pod formation.
    Strengthening the field management of peanut cultivation can better exert the production potential of peanuts. In the past, the measures of topping and soil cultivation, which were affirmed in experiments and mass experience as having an effect on increasing yield, promoted and ensured the bumper harvest in 1958; the bumper harvest in 1958, in turn, more clearly affirmed the effectiveness of these technical measures.
    Topping: Removing the main stem of the peanut can stimulate multiple branches and increase the number of flowers; however, because it is more labor-intensive, the area of promotion is not large except for some areas with habits. However, under the conditions of high yield, close planting, and high fertilizer, the significance of this measure has been further enriched, and it also shows its significant effect of inhibiting excessive growth. For example, in the "Daizhongchun" high-yield field of the Nongchong Team of the Shentu People's Commune in Zhangpu, Fujian, the plant growth was weak due to the high density, sufficient fertilizer, and high water content; however, the growth was stronger in the seedlings that had been topped. The plant height after topping was about five to ten centimeters lower than that of those that were not topped, the internodes were short, which was conducive to the fruit pegs entering the soil and forming pods; at the same time, it could also promote multiple branches and more flowers. The best time for topping is before the start of flowering.
    Soil Cultivation: Under high-yield conditions, the flowering site of the plant will inevitably be raised. In order to help the fruit pegs enter the soil as soon as possible, soil cultivation has a great effect. However, under high-density planting conditions, consideration should be given to maintaining an appropriate row spacing to facilitate field management work.

    密植是花生丰产的中心环节
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    花生是我国主要油料作物之一，解放后单位面积产量和总产量虽都逐年上升，但仍未能充分满足需要。1958年在大跃进的新形势下，花生虽然由于春旱的影响，限制了播种面积，甚至延迟了播期，但仍然获得空前未有的大丰收，单位面积产量约为1957年的138.5％，总产量约增加一倍左右。
    突破了密度关是1958年花生得以大丰收的一个关键性的技术措施。过去习惯上都认为栽培花生要依靠多分枝，才能多开花多结果，当密度增加时势必要减少分枝数，相应的要减少开花部位，因此不提倡密植。这种说法，在土壤肥力较低的情况下有一定的道理，而人们对密植的观念却因此受到一定的影响。
    实际上，密度的增产作用是随着施肥量和土壤水分的供应状况而消长的。根据1958年的丰产经验看来株数和产量的关系大体为十比一（十株花生结果一斤），这说明必需在一定密度基础上才可能创造高额丰产。为了达到丰产指标，必需有相适应的肥料和水分，才能保证植株更好的生长、结实。在大面积生产情况下，普通型丛生大花生每亩一万八千到二万五千株，珍珠豆型花生可略增，即可保证二千斤左右的产量。采用一尺上下的行距，三粒穴播或等距宽幅单粒点播（宽条播）均可，但条播有显著的增产作用。
    最适当的栽培密度，应该在充分利用空间和土壤肥力的条件下，保证植株经济性状的最优良的生育状况，以取得最高的产量。因而花生丰产的中心问题，实际上就是以密植为中心的几个主要环节的配合问题。
    1．分级选种，适期播种，浸种催芽，保证全苗、壮苗。
    为了保证植株的合理分布，除了播种量和播种方式以外，如何保持苗齐苗旺是达到密植增产目标的必要手段。如果缺苗甚多，虽然播种时达到了密植的要求，实际上却不能达到密植增产的目的。为了苗齐苗旺，应注意留种用花生的收获、储存、晒果、剥壳和分级选种工作。同级种子（质量相同的种子）播种于同一地块中，生长势必大体相似，可以避免相互影响，这在高度密植情况下尤其重要。
    花生发芽对于温度的要求较高，土温不足出苗每每延迟甚久，而且极不整齐。播种前进行浸种催芽，不但出苗早而且整齐一致。
    早播可以延长生育期，这对于开花期分散的花生更为重要。最适当的播种期，应根据当地的气温、地势和土质来确定。华北区大体上以“立夏”前后为宜，小花生可略早些。
    2．苗期控制水分，促进根系纵深发展；适期追肥浇水，可以促进多花早荚。
    过去习惯把花生栽培在旱地上，加以管理粗放，一直产量很低。但事实证明，花生在灌溉情况下，很易于获得高产。浇水的次数应根据自然条件来确定，一般应在三次以上。第一次在苗后期圆棵阶段，正当花蕾大量分化时期，结合追肥浇水可促进花蕾的分化，增多开花数，并可促使开花整齐。以后可以根据降雨和土壤水分情况，结合追肥浇水；但应保证不使植株受旱，直至大部果针入土为止。
    一般大花生一个荚果从开花到成熟约需五十到六十天，小花生略短些，所以在收获前两个月左右，应完成促进开花的一系列措施。这个时期，由于果针基本上已全部入土，加以气温逐渐降低，应适当的控制土壤水分，延长灌溉的间距，达到增加土温的目的。这时如灌水过多，不但会延迟荚果膨大充实的时间，还会增多瘪果率；而且由于湿度过大，对于已成熟的荚果也有不良的影响。
    花生苗期生育缓慢，但根系的扩展很快，所以幼苗的抗旱性较强，同时在较为干旱的情况下更有利于根系向纵深发展。
    3．增施基肥，多用磷钾肥，推行根瘤菌拌种。
    过去人们错误地认为花生适于在瘠薄的土地上生长，不需施用大量肥料，尤其因为有根瘤菌的共生作用，更不适于施用氮肥。根据分析证明，花生对于肥料三要素的需要量很大。在一般生产条件下，假设干草与荚果的比例为一比一，则每千斤花生产量约需氮素五十五斤，磷素十斤，钾素三十斤。
    根据1958年各地丰产经验，亩产花生一千到二千斤的，土杂肥的施用量不应少于二万斤，并应施入过磷酸钙二十到三十斤，草木灰三百到五百斤；还应在它的结实期中施用一部分迟效性肥料，以利荚果发育。1958年很多地区于花生生育期结合培土施入一部分土粪，对于促进荚果成熟与饱满有很大作用。花生的花芽分化很早，如果能在始花期前施用二十斤左右的硫酸铵或用速效性农家肥料分期追肥，对于促进开花、结实有极为显著的作用。为了保证根瘤菌的增产效果，应切实注意合理的使用方法。
    花生对于钙质的要求很高，尤其在酸性土上施用石灰不但能中和土壤酸性，而且还能保证供应充分的钙质，促使荚果发育；如果缺乏钙质，就要产生空荚或瘪果。
    4．深耕能促进根系发育，奠定稳固的生长基础。
    花生产区的老农根据多年的经验，认为花生喜爱生土，不宜连作；但当连作时通过深翻，“客土”也可抵消因连作所产生的不良影响。这除了由于深翻、“客土”补充了前作花生所大量损耗了的养分以外，还创造了深厚松软的土层，有利于保水保肥，也更有利于土壤微生物的活动。
    耕翻的深度，因各地土质的差异极大，除了高额丰产栽培可以根据需要的情况确定外，一般的沙壤或沙土，可根据人力条件深翻一到一尺半。
    5．品种与栽培。
    1958年花生丰产的范围很广，因而丰产品种也很复杂，有普通型丛生大花生或匍伏花生，也有珍珠豆型小花生。这些品种，在植物学形态上有显著的差异，结实部位亦不尽相同。因为各地群众根据多年来积累的经验，明确了品种的特性，在密度和田间管理的安排上能符合某一特殊品种生物学特性的要求，因而不论什么样的品种类型都有可能创造高额丰产。曾经有人说珍珠豆型小花生结实集中，适于密植，所以是一个丰产栽培类型。但结实分散的普通型丛生大花生，在人们的辛勤栽培下，去年也同样获得过高额丰产。这些事实，有力地摧毁了某些人的条件论。
    品种类型与丰产关系不大，丰产与否的关键，在于根据品种的特性决定适当的密度和相应的田间管理方法。当然这不等于忽视或否定品种的丰产性状。1958年各地高额丰产中所应用的品种，都是经过多年选择、淘汰所保留的当地最优良农家种，例如福建南安大面积栽培的是“中流球”品种，湖北红安种的几乎全部均为红安直立花生。
    根据这些情况，各地在1959年花生的大生产中，应着重从当地农家品种中选拔二至三个适于当地不同地区生长的品种，分别制定出相应的密度定额、施肥条件和管理方法，为1959年的花生大丰收作好准备工作。
    6．保证田净、土松；进行摘心、培土，促进结荚。
    加强花生栽培的田间管理工作，可以更好的发挥花生的生产潜力。过去在试验和群众经验中所肯定对增产有作用的摘心、培土等项措施，促进并保证了1958年大丰收；1958年的大丰收，反过来也更明确的肯定了这些技术措施的效果。
    摘心：摘除花生的主茎，可以刺激多分枝和增多开花数；但因费工较多，除了一部分有习惯的地区以外，推广面积不大。但在高产、密植、多肥的情况下，又进一步丰富了这个措施的意义，还显示了它的显著的抑制徒长的作用。例如福建漳浦深土人民公社农冲中队的“倒种春”丰产田，由于密度大、肥力足、水分高、株丛生长纤弱；但在苗期经过摘心的，生长则较健壮。摘心后的株高约比不摘心的低五到十厘米，节间短，利于果针入土结实；同时还能促使多分枝，多开花。摘心的时间，最好在始花期前。
    培土：在高额丰产情况下，植株的开花部位势必提高，为了帮助果针早日入土，培土有很大作用。但在高度密植的情况下，应考虑保持适当的行距，以利田间管理工作。
