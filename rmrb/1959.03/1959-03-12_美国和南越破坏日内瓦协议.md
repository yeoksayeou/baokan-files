The United States and South Vietnam Violate the Geneva Accords

Recently, the situation in Indochina has become increasingly tense due to the U.S. imperialists intensifying an aggressive plan to undermine the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina. In this U.S. aggressive plan, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam plays the role of accomplice. After the U.S. instigated the Laotian reactionary authorities to issue a statement renouncing the Geneva Accords, South Vietnamese officials immediately echoed it, clamoring that they were not bound by the Geneva Accords. This attitude of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is not accidental. For four years since the Indochina armistice, the United States has consistently used the Ngo Dinh Diem clique as a tool to undermine the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina. The following are some of the main instances of the U.S. and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique violating the Geneva Accords over the past four years.

The U.S. Illegally Sends Military Personnel into South Vietnam

Article 16 of the Geneva Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam clearly stipulates that all reinforcements of troops and additional military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam. However, a U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group stationed in South Vietnam not only did not withdraw after the armistice but was greatly expanded. This military advisory group has various departments such as land, sea, and air forces, as well as staff, training (combat, weapons, training organization), logistics (joint supply office), intelligence (disguised as "direct assistance group"), and inspection bureaus. In June 1956, the U.S. sent another military delegation called the "Temporary Equipment Update Team" into South Vietnam; this military delegation included nine departments, including air force, navy, artillery, engineers, logistics transportation, health, general affairs, and administration. The U.S. has continuously sent military personnel to South Vietnam. By 1957, the number of U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam had increased from about 200 before the armistice to about 2,000, including as many as 280 senior officers. Currently, U.S. officers are stationed in every department, branch of service, and unit of the South Vietnamese army, and in some places, the number of U.S. officers even exceeds the number of South Vietnamese officers.

The U.S. Illegally Imports War Materials into South Vietnam

Article 17 of the Geneva Agreements stipulates: All reinforcements of all types of weapons, ammunition, and other war materials into Vietnam are prohibited, such as: combat aircraft, naval vessels, artillery, jet equipment and weapons, and armored vehicles. However, the U.S. has continuously violated the agreement since the Indochina armistice, reinforcing South Vietnam with large quantities of war materials. According to materials published by the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, the U.S. has imported war materials into South Vietnam by sea alone: 15 ships in 1955, 82 ships in 1956, and 109 ships in 1957, each ship carrying hundreds or even thousands of tons of war materials. And just from December 13 to 24, 1958, U.S. warships imported 3,900 tons and more than 1,000 boxes of war materials into South Vietnam from the ports of Saigon and Hoi An. According to incomplete statistics, the U.S. has reinforced South Vietnam with tens of thousands of tons of war materials in four years, including machine guns, artillery, tanks, fighter jets, warships, etc.

The U.S. Establishes Military Bases in South Vietnam

Article 18 of the Geneva Agreements stipulates: The establishment of new military bases is prohibited throughout Vietnam. Article 19 further stipulates: No foreign military bases shall be established in either zone of regroupment...

However, in recent years, the U.S. has not only expanded many existing military bases in South Vietnam but also established many new military bases. Before the armistice, South Vietnam had only six military airfields besides landing airfields for liaison and reconnaissance aircraft. After the armistice, under the planning and direct construction of the U.S., the number of air force airfields in South Vietnam has increased to twenty-one, which constitute a vast air force base network distributed throughout South Vietnam.

Buon Ma Thuot in the South Vietnamese Central Highlands is being built into a large land and air force base. U.S. Admiral Radford and many senior U.S. officers have visited Buon Ma Thuot for on-site inspections. As a result, the U.S. decided to build this area into a large land and air force base and headquarters for commanding military activities. Buon Ma Thuot has now become a special military zone.

In addition, the U.S. and South Vietnamese authorities are also using the construction of the Saigon-Bien Hoa highway as a pretext to establish hidden military bases. According to South Vietnam's "National Revolution Newspaper," all the equipment and materials needed for the construction of this highway are provided by the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group. In fact, the so-called "Saigon-Bien Hoa Highway" is not a highway but a hidden military construction that turns the entire Saigon-Bien Hoa area into a huge base for the U.S. to engage in military activities in Southeast Asia.

Before the armistice, South Vietnam's naval bases only had the partially equipped bases of Cần Giờ (Saigon) and Da Nang and the Nha Trang mooring port. At present, in addition to turning Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Bay, and Qui Nhon into new naval bases, the U.S. is also planning to convert Bến Gề Bay (Dam Nhai Bay) into a submarine base. At the same time, many military facilities are being added to the Da Nang base and the Cần Giờ base. According to the "Saigon Gazette," Da Nang is to be built into "one of the most solid military bases."

U.S. Conspiracy to Pull South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Group

In September 1954, the U.S. colluded with several countries influenced by it to establish a military aggressive bloc called the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and unilaterally declared South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to be within the "protected area" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

In February 1955, Dulles formally stated that he hoped South Vietnamese authorities would have representatives attend the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting in Bangkok. In November 1955, O'Daniel, head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in South Vietnam, further declared: "It is time to consider the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) directly participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Under the instigation of the U.S., South Vietnam has also expressed its hope to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. On March 7, 1956, South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau openly said at a press conference: "If you ask me: 'Does Vietnam hope to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization?' I can answer you: 'Yes'."

Due to opposition from world public opinion, South Vietnam has not dared to openly participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization today; however, South Vietnamese authorities have continuously sent delegations to participate in various meetings and military exercises of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as observers.

Article 19 of the Geneva Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam stipulates:
"...Each party shall ensure that the areas assigned to it shall not adhere to any military alliance or be used for the resumption of hostilities or to further an aggressive policy." Obviously, the planning of attempting to make South Vietnam participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military alliance, which occurred after the U.S. included South Vietnam in the so-called "protected area," and the various activities of South Vietnam participating in this military alliance are serious violations of the Geneva Agreements.

South Vietnamese Authorities Persecute Former Resistance Personnel

Article 14(c) of the Geneva Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam stipulates: "Each party undertakes to refrain from any reprisals or discrimination against individuals or organizations on account of their activities during the period of hostilities and to guarantee their democratic liberties." However, since the armistice, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, under the instigation and assistance of the U.S., has carried out frantic reprisals and suppression against former resistance personnel and patriots. According to incomplete figures submitted by the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Commission, from the restoration of peace to November 1957, South Vietnamese authorities carried out 6,172 arrest incidents, killed 2,148 people, wounded 5,182 people, imprisoned 65,211 people, and 778 people disappeared. By 1958, more than 183,000 people had been illegally arrested by South Vietnamese authorities. Not long ago, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique carried out a shocking barbaric massacre in the Phu Loi concentration camp in Thu Dau Mot Province, South Vietnam. They poisoned the food of 6,000 political prisoners, killing more than 1,000 former Vietnamese resistance personnel and patriots.

The crimes of the U.S. and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam in violating the Geneva Agreements go far beyond the facts mentioned above. For four years since the armistice, the U.S. has consistently instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to refuse to hold general elections in accordance with the provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference to achieve the reunification of Vietnam. Not only that, but the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has repeatedly rejected the proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to achieve the reunification of Vietnam through peaceful consultation, and even the proposals for economic and cultural exchanges between the North and South, as well as allowing women and children to visit relatives, have been rejected. This policy of the U.S. and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the Geneva Agreements and divide Vietnam has created a tense situation in Indochina and prevented the desire of 25 million Vietnamese people for the reunification of their motherland from being realized to this day.

### 美国和南越破坏日内瓦协议

    美国和南越破坏日内瓦协议
    最近，由于美帝国主义在加紧执行一项破坏日内瓦协议和印度支那和平的侵略计划，从而使印度支那的局势日益紧张起来。在美国的这个侵略计划中，南越的吴庭艳集团充当着帮凶角色。人们看到，在美国策动老挝反动当局发表毁弃日内瓦协议的声明之后，南越官方人士立即起而呼应，大喊大叫不受日内瓦协议的约束。吴庭艳集团的这种态度并不是偶然的。在印度支那停战四年以来，美国一贯地利用吴庭艳集团作为它破坏日内瓦协议和印度支那和平的工具。下面就是四年来美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的一些主要情况。
    美国非法派遣军事人员进南越
    日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十六条明确规定，禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南。但是，美国设在南越的一个军事援助顾问团，在停战后不仅没有撤走，相反却大大地扩大了。这个军事顾问团设有陆、海、空军等各个部门以及参谋、训练（战斗、武器、训练组织）、后勤（联合补给处）、情报（伪装为“直接援助组”）、监察等处局。1956年6月，美国又增派了一个名为“临时装备更新团”的军事代表团进入南越；这个军事代表团包括空军、海军、炮兵、工兵、后勤运输、卫生、总务和行政等九个部门。美国不断往南越增派军事人员。到1957年，美国在南越的军事人员已由停战前的二百名增加到二千名左右，其中仅高级军官就有二百八十名之多。目前在南越军队的每一个部门、兵种、单位里都派有美国的军官，有些地方，美国军官的人数甚至超过了南越军官。
  美国非法向南越输入作战物资
    日内瓦协定第十七条规定：禁止各种类型的武器、弹药和其他作战物资的一切增援进入越南，如：作战飞机、海军舰艇、火炮、喷气式器械及武器、装甲车辆。但美国却在印度支那停战后不断违反协定，向南越增援大批作战物资。根据越南人民军总部公布的材料，美国仅通过海运输入南越的作战物资就有：1955年十五船，1956年八十二船，1957年一百零九船，每一船都载有作战物资几百吨甚至几千吨。而仅在1958年12月13日至24日，美国军舰又从西贡、会安港口向南越输入三千九百吨和一千多箱的战争物资。据不完全统计，四年中，美国增援南越的作战物资达数万吨，有机关枪、火炮、坦克、战斗机、军舰等。
    美国在南越建立军事基地
    日内瓦协定第十八条规定：禁止在越南全境内建立新的军事基地。第十九条又规定：不得在双方集结区内建立属于外国的任何军事基地……
    然而几年来，美国在南越不但扩充了许多原有的军事基地而且建立了许多新的军事基地。在停战以前，除了供联络机和侦察机使用的降落机场以外，南越只有六个军事机场。停战以后，在美国的筹划和直接修建下，南越的空军机场已增加到二十一个，它们构成了分布于南越全境的广大的空军基地网。
    南越多乐高原的邦美蜀正在被修建成为陆、空军大基地。美国海军上将雷德福及许多美国高级军官，曾先后到邦美蜀进行实地视察。结果美国决定把这个地区修建成为一个陆、空军大基地和指挥军事活动的司令部。邦美蜀现在已经变成一个特别军事地区。
    此外，美国和南越当局还以修筑西贡—边和大公路为名来建立隐蔽的军事基地。据南越的“国家革命报”透露，这条公路修建所需的装备和材料全部是由美国军事援助顾问团提供的。事实上，所谓“西贡—边和公路”并不是一条公路，而是一个隐蔽的军事建筑，这个军事建筑把西贡—边和整个地区变成美国在东南亚从事军事活动的巨大基地。
    南越的海军基地在停战前只有丐?（西贡）和岘港两个并未全部装备的基地及芽庄停靠港。目前，美国除了正在把芽庄、金兰湾、归仁修建成新的海军基地外，还筹划把槟绘湾（达约湾）改建为潜水艇基地。同时，在岘港基地和丐?基地增建许多军事设备。据“西贡公报”透露，岘港将要被建成为“最坚固的军事基地之一。”
  美国阴谋拉南越进东南亚集团
    1954年9月，美国拉拢了若干受它影响的国家建立了名为“东南亚条约组织”的军事侵略集团，并且单方面宣布把南越、柬埔寨和老挝置于东南亚条约组织“保护地区”之内。
    1955年2月，杜勒斯就正式表示，希望南越当局有代表出席曼谷的东南亚条约组织会议。1955年11月，美国驻南越军事援助顾问团长奥丹尼尔更进一步宣称：“是考虑越南共和国（南越）直接参加东南亚条约组织的时候了。”
    南越在美国的唆使下，也曾表示希望参加东南亚条约组织。1956年3月7日，南越外交部长武文牡在记者招待会上公开说：“如果你问我：‘越南是否希望参加东南亚条约组织’？我可以答复你：‘是的’。”
    由于世界舆论反对，南越今天虽未敢公然参加东南亚条约组织；但南越当局却不断派遣代表团以观察员身分参加东南亚条约组织的各次会议和军事演习。
    关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十九条规定：
  “……双方应注意不使划归它们的地区加入任何军事同盟，并不使这些地区用于敌对行动的再起，或服务于侵略政策”。显然，美国在把南越囊括在所谓“保护地区”以后所发生的、企图使南越参加东南亚条约组织军事同盟的策划，以及南越参加这个军事同盟的各种活动，是严重违反日内瓦协议的。
    南越当局迫害前抗战人员
    关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十四条丙款规定：“各方约定，不因个人和团体，在敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由。”但停战以来，南越吴庭艳集团却在美国的指使和援助下，对前抗战人员和爱国人士进行了疯狂的报复和镇压。根据越南人民军总部联络代表团向国际委员会提出的不完全的数字，自和平恢复到1957年11月，南越当局制造了六千一百七十二次逮捕事件，杀害了二千一百四十八人，打伤五千一百八十二人，监禁六万五千二百一十一人，失踪的七百七十八人。到1958年，遭南越当局非法逮捕的已达十八万三千多人。不久以前，吴庭艳集团更在南越土龙木省富利集中营进行了一次骇人听闻的野蛮大屠杀。它在六千名政治犯的饭里下了毒药，杀死了一千多名越南前抗战人员和爱国人士。
    美国和南越吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的罪行远不止于上述的事实。停战四年以来，美国一贯指使吴庭艳集团拒绝按照日内瓦会议最后宣言的规定，举行普选，以实现越南的统一。不止如此，吴庭艳集团还一再拒绝越南民主共和国政府提出的通过和平协商途径实现越南统一的建议，甚至连南北双方促进经济和文化交流，以及允许妇女、儿童来往探亲的建议也加以拒绝。美国和吴庭艳集团这种破坏日内瓦协议、分裂越南的政策，造成印度支那的紧张局势，使越南二千五百万人民要求祖国统一的愿望至今不能实现。　（亚）（附图片）
