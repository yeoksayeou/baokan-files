Cadres Develop Barren Mountains, Barren Mountains Train Cadres
Jiangxi Reviews the Great Achievements of Transferred Cadres in Building Mountainous Areas

(Our report) Nanchang – Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee convened a representative meeting of state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms established by 50,000 transferred cadres from the entire province. The meeting summarized the achievements and gains of the 50,000 cadres over the past year and studied the tasks of the state-owned reclamation farms for 1959.

After discussion, the meeting unanimously agreed that the transfer of 50,000 cadres to mountainous areas effectively strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses, greatly stimulated the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and thus accelerated the economic development of mountainous areas, creating a brand-new situation in mountainous production in the past year.

In the winter of 1957, 50,000 transferred cadres from Jiangxi arrived in the mountainous areas, braving the severe cold to climb the Jinggang Mountains, Damao Mountains, Wuyi Mountains, and other mountains ranging from several hundred to one thousand meters above sea level. Over the past year, they shoveled away ice and snow to set up stoves, opened mountains and felled trees to build houses, and blazed trails through thorns and thistles to cultivate grassland, selflessly laboring to build state-owned reclamation farms, regardless of difficulties. At the same time, they also devoted manpower, materials, and time to actively helping the people in mountainous areas develop production and culture. All of this greatly encouraged the people in the mountainous areas. In the past, many mountain farmers were not content to stay on the mountains and lacked sufficient confidence in building and developing the mountainous areas. They said, "Socialism can only go to the plains and cities, not up the mountains." After the cadres went up the mountains, they said, "Socialism has gone up the mountains." Those who originally wanted to move down the mountains no longer wanted to move down, and those who had already moved down moved back up. The more than 1,800 peasant households who moved away from Mengshan in 1952 saw the transferred cadres building on a large scale on Mengshan and moved back up Mengshan. In particular, the spirit of hard struggle and selfless labor of the transferred cadres greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the people in the mountainous areas, thereby accelerating the construction of the mountainous areas. When the transferred cadres in Jinggang Mountain were jointly building a hydroelectric power station with the masses, in order to race against the mountain floods for time, many cadres, disregarding the cold, jumped into the deep water to block the gaps and build dams. The masses were greatly moved and said, "The cadres cultivated by the Communist Party are like tigers when they go up the mountains and like dragons when they enter the water. They are truly good examples for us to learn from!" Then, they jumped into the water one after another and worked together with the cadres. The transferred cadres in Huanggang Mountain went up the mountain to cut thatch bamboo and carry wood, regardless of wind and rain, and returned early and late every day. The cadres of the surrounding people's communes used this to educate the members to learn from the transferred cadres and compete with the transferred cadres in enthusiasm.

As a result of the year-long battle of 50,000 transferred cadres and the people of the mountainous areas, the face of the mountainous areas of Jiangxi has greatly changed. The cadres have reclaimed more than 280,000 mu of wasteland from places overgrown with thorns and weeds, and have achieved the first harvest on these lands. Barren mountains with an area of 700,000 mu have been planted with trees, firs, and various fruit trees. The mountainous areas, which have never heard the sound of machines, have now established more than 5,600 small factories for brewing wine, papermaking, oil extraction, and iron smelting. The transferred cadres have also jointly built more than 40 small hydropower and thermal power stations with the people of the mountainous areas, and electric lights have begun to illuminate the hills. In the past year, 1,300 kilometers of new roads have been built in the mountainous areas, and most of the mountain tops are accessible by car. Now the people in the mountainous areas say that the mountains have changed greatly in the year that the cadres have gone up the mountains. The fact is indeed so. Take Wufeng Ridge in Damao Mountain as an example. When the transferred cadres climbed Wufeng Ridge last year, Wufeng Ridge was full of weeds and bushes taller than a person, and there was no one living there for more than ten miles around. However, today's Wufeng Ridge has built a road accessible to cars and more than 20 clean white houses; there are factories, schools, post offices, supply and marketing cooperatives, and bank business offices. More than 1,200 transferred cadres and farmers live here. Wufeng Ridge has become a bustling small mountain town.

In a year of labor, the transferred cadres have also transformed and improved themselves, further strengthening their ideas of serving the working people, increasing their production knowledge, and learning certain production techniques. At the end of the meeting, through the exchange of achievements and experiences, the grand task of continuing to build mountainous areas in 1959 was put forward. (Attached pictures)

    干部开发荒山　荒山锻炼干部
    江西检阅下放干部建设山区的巨大成就
    本报讯　最近，中共江西省委、江西省人民委员会召开了由全省五万下放干部建立的国营综合垦殖场代表会议。会议总结了五万干部下放一年来的成绩和收获，研究了1959年国营垦殖场的任务。
    会议经过讨论，一致认为，全省五万干部下放山区，有效地增强了党与群众的联系，大大激发了群众的革命干劲，从而加速了山区经济的发展，使山区生产在过去一年中出现了一个崭新的局面。
    1957年冬，江西五万下放干部到达了山区，他们冒着严寒爬上拔海数百公尺以至一千公尺高的井冈山、大茅山、武夷山等一百多个山头。一年来，他们刨开冰雪摆炉灶，开山伐木盖房屋，披荆斩棘开草地，不畏艰难地为建设国营垦殖场而忘我的劳动着。同时，他们又抽出人力、物力和时间，积极帮助山区人民发展生产，发展文化。所有这些，大大鼓舞了山区人民。过去，许多山区农户不安心在山上，对建设和开发山区缺乏足够信心。他们说：“社会主义只能到平原和城市，上不了山。”干部上山后，他们说：“社会主义上山了”，原来想搬下山来的人再不想往下搬，已经搬下来的纷纷搬回，1952年从蒙山搬走的一千八百多户农民，看到下放干部在蒙山上大搞建设之后，又都搬上了蒙山。特别是下放干部艰苦奋斗、忘我劳动的精神，大大激发了山区人民的干劲，从而加速了山区的建设。井冈山下放干部在和群众共同兴建水电站时，为了和山洪争夺时间，很多干部不顾寒冷跳到深水中堵口筑坝。群众大为感动，说：“共产党培养出来的干部上山如猛虎，入水似蛟龙，真是我们学习的好榜样！”接着，纷纷跳下水里，与干部一起干。黄岗山下放干部不避风雨上山砍茅竹、扛木头，每天早出晚归。周围人民公社的干部就以此教育社员向下放干部看齐，和下放干部比赛干劲。
    五万下放干部与山区人民奋战一年的结果，江西山区面貌已大大改观。干部们从长满荆棘杂草的地方开垦出了二十八万多亩荒地，并在这些土地上获得了第一次丰收。面积达七十万亩的荒山，被栽上了木、杉和各种果树。从来没有机器响声的山区，如今也办起了酿酒、造纸、榨油、炼铁等各种小型工厂五千六百多个。下放干部还与山区人民共同建起了小型水力和火力发电站四十多座，电灯开始照亮了山岗。一年来，山区新修公路一千三百公里，绝大部分山头通了汽车。现在山区人民都说，干部上山一年，山区大变了样。事实也确是这样。以大茅山乌风岭为例。去年下放干部爬上乌风岭时，乌风岭上到处是一人多高的杂草和树丛，方圆十多里无人烟。然而，今日的乌风岭上已修通了汽车路，盖起了二十多栋洁白的房屋；有工厂、学校、邮电所、供销社、银行营业所。住在这里的下放干部和农民有一千二百多人。乌风岭已成了一座热闹的小山城。
    下放干部在一年的劳动中也改造和提高了自己。更加坚定了为劳动人民服务的思想，增长了生产知识，学会了某些生产技术。会议最后，通过交流成绩和经验，提出了1959年继续建设山区的宏伟任务。（附图片）
