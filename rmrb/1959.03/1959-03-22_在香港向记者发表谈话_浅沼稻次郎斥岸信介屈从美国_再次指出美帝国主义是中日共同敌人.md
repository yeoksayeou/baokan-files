　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 21st: Asanuma Inejirō, head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, told reporters in Hong Kong today, reiterating that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan.

　　Asanuma Inejirō said: "At present, U.S. imperialism occupies Japan's territories of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, and also occupies China's territory of Taiwan. It is based on these facts that we say U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan." He refuted Kishi Nobusuke's remarks on March 17th defending U.S. imperialism. He said: Kishi Nobusuke's statement only shows that he wants to continue to be subservient to the United States, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that he is a spokesman for U.S. imperialism.

　　Asanuma Inejirō said: "Since Mr. Zhang Xiruo and I issued a joint statement in April 1957, friendly exchanges between China and Japan have developed greatly. However, due to Kishi Nobusuke's adoption of a policy of hostility towards China, this friendly relationship has been undermined. This is precisely why the resolution of relations between China and Japan must first solve political issues."

　　Regarding Sino-Japanese trade, Asanuma Inejirō pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke must implement the three principles put forward by China, namely, stopping the implementation of a policy of hostility towards China; not increasing conspiracies to create "two Chinas"; and not hindering the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan. Otherwise, Sino-Japanese trade cannot be restored. Asanuma Inejirō finally expressed his admiration and joy for the achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction, saying that this is a great achievement made by the Chinese people in their struggle with nature.

　　A group of seven members of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, led by Asanuma Inejirō, arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou today and will transfer to return to Japan.

    在香港向记者发表谈话
    浅沼稻次郎斥岸信介屈从美国
    再次指出美帝国主义是中日共同敌人
    新华社香港21日电　日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎今天向香港报纸记者发表谈话时，再次强调美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。
    浅沼稻次郎说：“目前美帝国主义侵占了日本的领土冲绳和小笠原等地方，同时又侵占了中国的领土台湾。正是根据这些事实，我们说美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。”他驳斥了岸信介在3月17日发表的替美帝国主义辩解的谈话。他说：岸信介这种说法只表明他要继续屈从美国，我们说他是美帝国主义的发言人也不会过分。
    浅沼稻次郎说：“自从在1957年4月我同张奚若先生发表了共同声明以后，中日两国之间的友好交往曾经一度有很大的发展。但是由于岸信介采取了敌视中国的政策，以致把这种友好的关系给破坏了。这正是为什么强调中日两国之间的关系的解决，在目前必须首先解决政治问题的原因。”
    对于中日的贸易问题，浅沼稻次郎指出，岸信介必须实行中国所提出的三项原则，这就是停止执行敌视中国的政策；不增加制造“两个中国”的阴谋；不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复。否则，中日贸易是不可能恢复的。浅沼稻次郎最后对中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的成就表示十分敬佩和高兴，他说，这是中国人民同自然界的斗争中所取得的伟大战绩。
    日本社会党访华代表团部分团员一行共七人，在浅沼稻次郎率领下，今天从广州抵达香港转道返回日本。
