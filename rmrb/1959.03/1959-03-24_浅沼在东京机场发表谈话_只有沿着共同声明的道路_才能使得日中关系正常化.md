Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 23rd: The Japanese Socialist Party delegation led by Inejiro Asanuma returned to Tokyo by plane this morning. Representatives from various Japanese organizations, numbering approximately 400, greeted them at the airport.

    Asanuma delivered a speech at a press conference held in the airport waiting room. Asanuma first expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for the warm reception given to the delegation, and conveyed the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people, entrusted to him by the Chinese people. Asanuma emphasized that the Socialist Party delegation and the relevant Chinese parties fully agreed that the Kishida government's unfriendly policy towards China and the deceptive practice of attempting to separate politics and economics are the reasons for the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations to their worst state, and that only by following the path indicated in the joint statement issued by Zhang Xiruo and Asanuma can Sino-Japanese relations be normalized in the future.

    Referring to his observations in various parts of China, Asanuma said that through visits to factories and people's communes, he saw that all the Chinese people are united in advancing towards the great road of building socialism, which greatly moved him.

    He said that his visit to China made him realize that when considering the future of Japan, although it is necessary to base considerations on Japan's own conditions, the existence of China cannot be ignored.

    Asanuma stated that the Socialist Party will resolutely launch a national movement in the future to demand that the Japanese government change its policy of hostility towards China, both inside and outside the Diet. Furthermore, it will systematically strengthen cultural, scientific, farmer, fisherman, worker, and other exchanges and interactions between Japan and China in order to strengthen the friendly relations between the people of the two countries.

    Kanzo Uchiyama, Director-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association, spoke at the press conference, expressing full support for the joint statement issued by Zhang Xiruo and Asanuma.

    浅沼在东京机场发表谈话
    只有沿着共同声明的道路
    才能使得日中关系正常化
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：由浅沼稻次郎率领的日本社会党访华代表团今天上午乘飞机回到东京。日本各界团体的代表约四百人到机场迎接。
    浅沼在机场候机室举行的记者招待会上发表了谈话。浅沼首先对中国政府和中国人民对代表团的热诚招待表示感谢，并且受中国人民的委托转达了中国人民对日本人民的深厚友谊。浅沼强调指出，社会党代表团同中国有关方面完全一致地认为，岸信介政府对中国的不友好政策和企图把政治和经济分开的骗人的做法才是使日中关系陷入最恶劣的状态的原因，并且今后只有沿着张奚若和浅沼发表的共同声明所指出的道路才能使日中关系正常化。
    浅沼谈到参观中国各地情况时说，他通过工厂和人民公社的参观，看到了全体中国人民正在团结一致地向着建设社会主义的大道迈进，这使他受到了很大的感动。
    他说，这次访问中国使他认识到：在考虑日本前途问题时，虽然要以日本自己的条件作为考虑的基础，但同时不可忽视中国的存在。
    浅沼表示，社会党今后将坚决展开国民运动，以便在国会内外要求日本政府改变敌视中国的政策。并且还要有计划地加强日本同中国之间的文化、科学、农民、渔民、工人等各方面的交流和往来，以便加强日中两国人民的友好关系。
    日中友好协会理事长内山完造在记者招待会上讲话，表示全面支持张奚若和浅沼发表的共同声明。
