    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th - TASS reported: The Presidium of the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee held a meeting in Moscow to discuss a series of issues related to carrying out solidarity and support movements, and the struggle of the people of various countries against the threat of war and against the aggressive military blocs cobbled together by the United States.

    At the meeting, the speakers unanimously paid tribute to the heroic Iraqi people and their national leader, Prime Minister Qasim, for crushing the conspiracy rebellion group, and expressed indignation at the propaganda campaign launched by foreign countries to undermine the unity of the Iraqi people. As the meeting pointed out, this movement, under the guise of anti-communism, has damaged the unity of the Arab peoples in the struggle against imperialism.

    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Yevgeny Zhukov, expressed regret over the sharp deterioration of relations between the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq, saying that this could cause damage to the entire Afro-Asian solidarity movement.

    The meeting adopted a resolution on holding "Algeria Week" in the Soviet Union from March 30 to April 7. At the initiative of the committee, the Soviet Union will also hold "Africa Freedom Day" on April 15 and "People's Struggle Day Demanding the Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea" in June.

    The resolution pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize public opinion against imperialist blocs and support the national liberation struggle of the African people.

    The meeting also adopted a resolution on the US signing a bilateral military agreement with Iran, condemning this unfriendly action towards the Soviet Union, which will aggravate the tense situation in the East.

    The Presidium of the Committee called on the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the International Commission of Jurists to issue appeals demanding that they protect Congolese patriots.

    对外国发动的反伊宣传运动表示愤慨
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联亚非团结委员会主席团在莫斯科举行会议，讨论了一系列有关开展团结声援运动、有关各国人民反对战争威胁和反对美国拼凑的侵略性军事集团的斗争问题。
    会上，发言者一致向粉碎了阴谋叛乱集团的英勇的伊拉克人民和他们的民族领袖卡塞姆总理致敬，并且对外国发动的破坏伊拉克人民团结的宣传运动表示愤慨。正如会议指出的那样，这个以反共为幌子的运动使阿拉伯各国人民在反对帝国主义斗争中的团结遭到了损失。
    苏联科学院院士叶夫根尼·茹科夫对阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国之间的关系尖锐化表示遗憾，他说，这有可能给整个亚非团结运动带来损失。
    会议通过了一项关于苏联从3月30日到4月7日举行“阿尔及利亚周”的决议。根据委员会的倡议，苏联还将在4月15日举行“非洲自由日”，在6月举行“要求美军撤离南朝鲜的人民斗争日”。
    决议指出，要动员舆论反对帝国主义集团，支持非洲人民的民族解放斗争。
    会议还就美国同伊朗签订双边军事协定这件事通过了一项决议，谴责这个对苏联不友好的、将使东方紧张局势加剧的行动。
    委员会主席团呼吁国际民主法律工作者协会和国际法律工作者委员会发出呼吁，要求它们保护刚果爱国者。
