To improve teacher quality and create conditions for better education, Henan has established a teacher training network.

(By our reporter, Chen Jian) With the great development of education, the number of ordinary middle and primary school teachers in Henan Province has grown to 300,000. Therefore, Party committees at all levels in Henan attach great importance to improving the work of teachers, equipping them with a large number of full-time cadres, and opening correspondence education and various types of normal schools. The four provincial higher normal colleges are responsible for establishing correspondence stations or branch stations for middle school teachers in six districts and one hundred and ten counties, with eight thousand middle school teachers with different levels of specialized education participating in the study. In order to train and improve primary school teachers, more than 80% of the counties in the province have opened in-service teacher training courses; townships and people's communes have also opened various types of short-term, crash course, temporary, and correspondence normal schools and training classes. Ordinary primary and secondary school teachers throughout the province can participate in studies or advanced studies in normal schools in different forms.

In this normal education system, the most active are the mass normal education organizations below the county level, which are flexible and diverse in form and can meet the needs of primary schools to improve the quality of teachers in a timely manner. Yucheng County has established a county-wide normal school headquarters, with fifteen townships each having a branch school. The county party committee has equipped the headquarters with eight full-time teachers, two of whom are responsible for holding in-service teacher training courses at the headquarters to train primary school teachers who have not reached the level of graduation from junior normal school. The other six live in the branch schools in three locations, assisting and guiding the fifteen branch schools in opening spare-time normal classes. The study time for each branch school is Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning. The content of the study is determined according to current needs. From textbook content and lesson preparation methods to teaching effectiveness and even how to correct homework, problems can be solved here. Now, 100% of the primary school teachers in the county participate in this type of study. Shangqiu County has a complete set of normal education organizations: the county has in-service teacher training courses, the township has a crash normal school, and the production brigade has teacher refresher courses. The county party school also provides rotational training for all political teachers in the county. Teachers of the Weixing People’s Commune in Suiping County read middle school in the normal school class of their own school in the morning and teach in the primary school class in the evening.

The provincial Kaifeng and Xinxiang Normal Colleges and the Kaifeng and Zhengzhou Normal Colleges have opened thirteen kinds of correspondence courses for middle school teachers in the province and have compiled a systematic set of textbooks to basically meet the needs of the students. Their method of correspondence is a combination of "correspondence education during normal times and centralized face-to-face instruction during vacations." Teachers with higher levels of normal school specialists and county-level senior high schools in various districts are counselors of correspondence schools. Some old professors and counselors also climbed mountains and ridges to go deep into schools to understand the situation, give lectures and tutoring.

These normal education and correspondence education programs have just started, but their effects have been initially seen. In counties such as Shangqiu, Fugou, Changge, Huaiyang, Yucheng, and Suixian, primary school teachers participating in rotational training have improved from the level of higher primary school to the level of junior normal school in major courses. Fifty-four primary school teachers in Zhu Ji township, Huaiyang, who have been trained, have been tested and forty-eight of them fully meet the national requirements. A female teacher named Guo Ailian used to recite books by rote in class and students were unwilling to listen; after the county training, her level was greatly improved. Achievements have also been made in correspondence education. Many students praised their teachers for improving their teaching level after participating in correspondence courses. Teachers of Shundian Middle School in Yuxian County recently took the first test after correspondence courses, and the average score of teachers in the school was above 80 points. Students praised the teachers in big-character posters, saying: "The teachers are more and more active in learning, and the courses are taught more and more fluently." Teachers in some middle schools in Xuchang reflected that because the correspondence textbooks are systematic and theoretical, and can be linked to reality, many problems in the textbooks can be easily solved, and lectures are also bolder.

    提高教师水平为教好学生创造条件
    河南建成师范教育网
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省已经建成了一套培养、提高教师队伍的师范教育网。
    随着教育事业的大发展，河南省普通中、小学教师已发展到三十万人。因此，河南各级党委都十分重视教师的提高工作，配备了大批专职干部，开办函授教育和各式各样的师范学校。现在省办的四所高等师范院校，负责在六个专区和一百一十个县建立了中学教师函授站或分站，全省八千名不同专科毕业水平的中学教员参加学习。为培养提高小学教师，全省80％以上的县，开办了在职教员轮训班；乡、人民公社也开办了各式各样的短期、速成、临时、函授等师范学校和训练班。全省普通中小学教员，都能以不同的形式，参加师范学校的学习或进修。
    在这个师范教育体系中，最活跃的是县以下的群众性的师范教育组织，这些教育组织形式灵活多样，能及时满足小学提高师资的需要。虞城县设立了全县的师范学校总部，十五个乡各有分校，县委给总校配备了八名专职教员，其中两名负责在总校举办在职教员轮训班，调训不及初师毕业水平的小学教员。其他六名分三个点住在分校，协助和指导十五个分校开办业余师范班。各分校学习时间是每礼拜六下午或星期日上午。学习的内容根据当前需要确定。从课本内容、备课方法到教学效果，甚至于如何批改作业等问题，都可以在这里得到解答。现在全县百分之百的小学教员，都参加这样的学习。商丘县有了一套完备的师范教育组织：县有在职教员轮训班，乡有速成师范学校，生产大队有教员进修班。县党校还为全县所有学校轮训政治教员。遂平县卫星人民公社的教员，早晨在自己学校的师范班读中学，晚上在小学班教课。
    省办开封、新乡师范学院和开封、郑州师范专科学校，已经为全省中学教员开设了十三种函授课，并编出一套系统的教材，基本上满足学员的需要。他们函授的办法，是“平时函授和假期集中面授”相结合。各个专区师范专科学校和县立高级中学水平较高的教员，都是函授学校的辅导员。有些老教授和辅导员，还翻山越岭，深入学校了解情况，进行讲课和辅导。
    这些师范教育和函授教育只不过刚刚开办，但已初步看出它的效果。商丘、扶沟、长葛、淮阳、虞城、睢县等县，参加轮训的小学教员，在主要课程上，已从高小提高到初级师范水平。淮阳朱集乡五十四名受过培训的小学教员，经过测验，已有四十八名完全合乎国家的要求标准。有位叫郭爱莲的女教师，过去在上课时多是死念书本，学生不愿听；经过县的培训，水平大大提高。在函授方面，也同样取得了成绩。许多学生表扬老师参加函授后，教学水平提高了。禹县顺店中学的教员，最近进行了函授后的第一次测验，全校教师平均成绩在八十分以上。学生用大字报表扬老师说：“教员越学越积极，课程越讲越流利。”许昌一些中学的教员都反映：由于函授教材系统、理论性强，能联系实际，对课本上的许多问题，能迎刃而解，讲课也大胆了。
