    Seizing the Initiative, Facing Production, Relying on the Masses
    Heilongjiang's Financial and Trade Work Effectively Promotes Production
    (本报讯) This newspaper reports that along with the great agricultural harvest of 1958, Heilongjiang Province also achieved a great harvest in rural commodity production. The results of this great harvest are significant. Taking diversified economic undertakings alone, it increased the income of Heilongjiang's farmers by 600 million yuan. Based on the province's rural population of over 9 million, the average income per person reached 60 yuan, which is equivalent to the value of the commodity grain created in the countryside in one year last year.
    Heilongjiang's rural areas are full of treasures. In the fertile plain areas, which mainly produce crops, not only was there a great grain harvest, but farmers also expanded their avenues for sideline production, such as raising pigs, cattle, and bees, and growing white melon seeds. The average income per rural person reached more than 40 yuan. In the mountainous areas, where native products are unusually abundant, the average income per rural person reached 70 yuan. The grassland areas have even richer resources, with an average income per rural person reaching as much as 90 yuan.
    The 600 million yuan worth of sideline products produced by farmers, apart from their own consumption, were mostly supplied to urban, industrial, and mining areas, as well as for foreign trade. According to calculations by the Heilongjiang Provincial Foreign Trade Bureau, the total value of the 44 kinds of native products exported last year, if exchanged for tractors, could buy 1,480 tractors. At the same time, the waste products purchased from the countryside have become useful raw materials for industry. With this income from sideline production, the People's Communes have more solid funds to equip their industries. Ten counties across the province have already used this money to equip the commune's power stations and machine tools. The Weihe People's Commune in Shangzhi County, using a portion of its income from sideline production, built five power stations, purchased eighteen rice milling machines, one flour milling machine, and seven feed crushers. At the same time, this income also plays a significant role in enlivening the rural economy. It helps People's Communes to pay wages and improve the lives of farmers.
    In organizing farmers to produce and purchase such a large number of sideline products, Heilongjiang's financial and trade departments, under the unified arrangements of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, have properly combined agricultural production with financial and trade work. This has not only avoided affecting the central tasks but, on the contrary, has promoted the development of agricultural production. Based on the experience of previous years, the financial and trade departments have adopted the policy of starting with production to carry out financial and trade activities, which in turn promotes production development. Therefore, they actively support farmers in expanding avenues for sideline production and take the lead in demonstrating, adopting measures to "make what was originally unavailable available, increase what is small, accelerate what is slow, turn inanimate objects into living ones, turn limited natural conditions into artificial cultivation, and turn wild growth into domestic planting and breeding." Various breeding farms, experimental stations, and production bases were set up on a trial basis. Thirty-nine counties and cities throughout the province have carried out silkworm breeding experiments, and some counties have also artificially raised bullfrogs. In the development of production, all localities have organized professional teams. These professional teams engage in various activities during the gaps in agricultural production, and when the agricultural season is busy, these professional teams are all put into agricultural production. In procurement work, a combination of regular procurement and surprise procurement, and a combination of professional personnel and mass movements, were adopted. During the peak season for wild fruits and medicinal materials, staff from the financial and trade departments went into the mountains with the farmers to purchase on the spot, greatly facilitating the masses. During the tense periods of agricultural production, in order to closely integrate financial and trade work with the central tasks, both supporting the central tasks and ensuring the completion of financial and trade work tasks, surprise purchases were made using mass movement methods during the gaps in agricultural production. Shuangcheng County adopted this method and used seven days to complete 70% of the procurement task for the first half of the year. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee promptly summarized and promoted this experience, enabling commercial employees throughout the province to learn how to comprehensively arrange work, fully utilize the masses, and complete work tasks in sections and stages by squeezing gaps in time, thereby closely integrating financial and trade work with the central tasks.

    争取主动　面向生产　依靠群众
    黑龙江财贸工作有力地促进生产
    本报讯　在1958年农业大丰收的同时，黑龙江省又获得了农村商品性生产的大丰收。这个大丰收的成果是巨大的，仅以多种经营这一项，即为黑龙江省农民增加了六亿元的收入，按全省农村九百多万人口计算，平均每人收入就达六十元，它相等于去年一年农村所创造的商品粮价值。
    黑龙江的农村遍地都是财宝。在土地肥沃，以生产农作物为主的平原区，不仅获得粮食大丰收，而且农民们还扩大了副业生产的门路，如养猪、养牛、养蜂、种白瓜子等，平均每个农村人口收入达到四十元之多。在土特产异常丰收的山区，每个农村人口，平均收入达到七十元。在草原区资源更为丰富，每个农村人口平均收入竟达到九十元。
    农民生产价值六亿元的副业产品，除自己消费外，绝大部分供应了城镇、工矿地区，和对外贸易的需要。据黑龙江省对外贸易局计算：去年出口的四十四种土特产品的总值，若是换拖拉机能换一千四百八十架。同时，从农村收购来的废品，又成为工业上有用的原料。人民公社有了副业生产这笔收入，就有更雄厚的资金来武装自己的工业。全省已有十个县用这笔钱装备了公社的电站、机床。尚志县苇河人民公社，利用副业生产的一部分收入，办了五座发电站，购置了十八台制米机，一台磨面机，和七台饲料粉碎机，同时，这笔收入，对活跃农村经济，也有很大作用。它有助于人民公社发放工资，改善农民生活。
    黑龙江省财贸部门在组织农民生产和收购这样多的副业产品中，是在中共黑龙江省委统一安排下，使农业生产和财贸工作妥善的结合起来，不仅没有影响中心工作，相反的又促进了农业生产的发展。财贸部门根据以往几年的经验，采取了从生产入手开展财贸活动，又促进生产发展的方针。因此，积极地扶植农民扩大副业生产门路，并带头示范，采取了“原来没有的品种让它有，少的让它多，生产慢的变快，死物变成活物，自然条件有限的变成人工培育，野生野长的变成家植家养”的措施，试办了各种养殖场、试验站和生产基地。全省有三十九个县市开展了养蚕的试验工作，有的县份还人工饲养了田鸡。各地在发展生产中都组织了专业队，这种专业队在农业生产的空隙上，从事各种活动，而到农事季节繁忙的时候，这些专业队全部投入农业生产。在收购工作上，采取了经常收购和突击收购相结合，专业人员和群众运动相结合的办法。在野果、药材盛产期，财贸部门的工作人员，同农民一起入山，就地收购，大大便利了群众。在农业生产紧张的时候，为了使财贸工作和中心工作紧密结合，既支援中心工作，又保证财贸工作任务完成，就在农业生产的空隙时间里，用群众运动的方法突击收购。双城县采取这种办法，用七天时间突击完成上半年70％的收购任务。中共黑龙江省委及时总结和推广了这一经验，使全省商业职工学会了全面安排工作，充分发挥群众，串空隙、挤时间分项分段突击完成工作任务的方法，使财贸工作和中心工作紧密地结合起来。（附图片）
