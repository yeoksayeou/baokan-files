In the small bamboo houses of the various ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, every household has a fire pit made of four pieces of wood forming a square, with earth filling the middle. Whether it is the frosty winter or the hot summer, the fire in the fire pit always burns day and night. Whenever distinguished guests arrive, the first thing the host does is to make the fire burn brightly. This is a custom, a sign of respect for the guests.

Around the fire pit, I have spent many nights with the farmers, discussing important production matters in the village while admiring the beauty of the flames, watching how the flames sometimes stretch their bodies, sometimes curl up and lie down, sometimes spin, sometimes dance. The burning branches of the Malipo tree emit a fragrance, sometimes crackling and bursting, sometimes hissing and sizzling, singing joyful songs for us.

In the early days of liberation in 1950, when I first came to Xishuangbanna, I witnessed the poverty of the fraternal ethnic groups. Whether they were Dai, Lahu, Hani, or Kawa people, the vast majority had no cotton clothes, no bedding, and no quilts. In winter, they often huddled around the fire pit as a family, lying sprawled out, roasting themselves to resist the severe cold, roasting one side of their body, then turning over to roast the other side. When the spring planting season arrived, they would set fire to the mountains, and streaks of dark red fire snakes would crawl across the desolate cogon grass slopes, leaving behind ashes as fertilizer. Sparse grains would grow between the charred tree stumps. This could not help but remind me of the most primitive wisdom of mankind, of Suirenshi, who drilled wood to make fire, and of Prometheus, the fire thief, because it was fire that helped these remote ethnic groups survive the centuries of hardship, it was fire that gave people light, warmth, friendship, and moments of peace and happiness.

Today, the most primitive slash-and-burn farming methods have been eliminated. The Dai, Lahu, Hani, and Kawa people, among others, have also made new clothes and cotton quilts, and are no longer afraid of the cold of winter and the coolness of spring and autumn nights. Fire has begun to appear in the lives of the various ethnic groups in the border region in a new form. Throughout the year, I saw all kinds of fire. During the day, grass and sod fertilizer piles were burned in the fields, and countless white smoke rushed into the sky; at night, fire burned in the forests and on the ridges, driving away the darkness for the people accumulating and delivering fertilizer. If these thousands upon thousands of fires were a red dragon, then the thousands of bright lights reflected in the paddy fields and green seedlings on the nights of transplanting and weeding would be a sparkling sea of stars. And in the usual evenings, when the cooking smoke had not yet dissipated over the village, there were also many flickering, not very bright pine torches in the bamboo houses and Buddhist temples. Those were the elderly grandfathers and grandmothers, eagerly and attentively learning culture and learning phonetic alphabets from the young men and women. And then there was the most unforgettable night of the autumn harvest rush, the burning rice straw burning so brightly like luminous fire corals. Whenever the fire crackled, people said: "The fire is laughing!" They compared the laughter of the fire to an auspicious omen. Along with the laughter of the fire, people's labor became even more intense and enjoyable!

When the first granite dam in Xishuangbanna began to be built on the Liusha River, there was a huge rock that could not be drilled with blasting holes and could not be blasted open with explosives. The old people of the Dai ethnic group said: "This is where the water ghost, Bipengxu, lives. She doesn't want to move elsewhere!" What should be done? The water conservancy engineering team proposed to burn it with fire. Everyone cut down many large tree trunks, built them on this stubborn stone, and burned them for days and nights. The stone underwent a chemical change, the blasting holes could be drilled, and the explosives worked. In the deafening roar, the water ghost Bipengxu was eliminated. It was fire again that broke the superstition of thousands of years.

The fire in the tea plantations is perhaps the most beautiful sight. In order to rush to pick the tea leaves and let the tea leaves come down from the trees early so that they would not get old, several large-scale collaborations were organized throughout the year, picking them overnight. The old women in the village, who had not participated in labor for many years, came with crutches. The children, who were very young and only half a person tall, also came. The monks came, and the Buddhas came. And those Han residents from the city, the cadres in the organs, all came to the tea plantations with horse lanterns and pine torches to rush to pick tea. The hillsides were full of lights, and from a distance, they were all green with the reflection of the tea trees.

Fire embodies people's beautiful ideals; fire shines with the brilliance of unity and friendship between nationalities. It not only illuminates the tea gardens of the border region, but also illuminates people's hearts. This year, the Liusha River Hydropower Station has begun construction. In the near future in Xishuangbanna, a new kind of fire—electric lights—will also appear in the small bamboo houses of the various ethnic groups. The folk singers have begun to sing for the power station in ancient melodies. They say: "Fire is our closest friend, our partner. In order to show respect and gratitude to fire, we will build roads and build houses for it, so that it will forever illuminate the great ideals of the Chinese people."

    火
    季康
    在云南西双版纳各族人民的小竹楼上，每一家每一户都有一个用四根木料围成方形中间填上泥土的火塘。不论是降霜的冬天或是炎热的夏日，火塘里的火总是在日夜的燃烧，每逢有贵客来临，主人要做的第一件事便是把火弄旺，这是一种风俗，表示对客人的礼貌。
    围着火塘，我和农民们度过了不少个夜晚，一面讨论着寨子里的生产大事，一面欣赏着火焰的美，看火焰怎样忽而伸展身体，忽而蜷伏倒卧，忽而打旋，忽而跳舞，燃烧着的麻栗树枝散发着芳香，有时噼噼拍拍地爆烈着，有时滋滋拉拉地嘶叫着，为我们唱着欢快的歌。
    1950年解放初期，我第一次来到西双版纳时，亲眼目睹了兄弟民族的贫困生活，不论是傣族、拉祜族、哈尼族或是佧佤族，绝大部分都没有棉衣，没有铺垫，没有被子。冬天，他们往往一家人围在火塘边，横七竖八地躺卧着，烤着火抵御严寒，烤热了一边身子，翻过身来再烤另一边。当春天耕种的季节来临，他们又放火烧山，一条条暗红色的火蛇，爬过荒凉的茅坡，留下的灰烬，便是肥料，焦黑的根根树桩之间，生长出稀疏的谷物。这使我不能不想到人类最原始的智慧，想到那钻木取火的燧人氏，想到盗火者普洛米修斯，因为正是火，帮助了这些边远的民族，度过了千百年来困苦的岁月，正是火，给了人们光明、温暖、友谊和片刻的安宁与幸福。
    今天，刀耕火种最原始的耕种方法已经消灭，傣族、拉祜族、哈尼族和佧佤族等各族人民也都制起了新衣棉被，再不怕冬天的寒冷和春秋之夜的凉意了。火，开始以一种新的姿态在边疆各族人民的生活中出现。一年间，我看见了各种各样的火。白天，田野间焚烧着草皮肥堆，无数道白烟冲向云霄；夜晚，火在童林和田埂上燃烧着，为积肥送肥的人们驱走了黑暗。如果说这千堆万把的火光，是一条红色的巨龙，那么，在插秧和薅锄的夜晚，满田满坝映在水田和绿秧中的万盏明灯，就是一片晶晶闪光的星海。而在平常的黄昏，炊烟还没在寨子上空消散的时候，竹楼和佛寺里也都有很多跳动着的不很明亮的松明火，那是年老的大爹大妈，正热心专注地向小伙子小姑娘们学文化，学拼音字母。还有那最难使人忘怀的秋收突击之夜，燃烧着的禾秆旺盛得像一颗颗透亮的火珊瑚，每当火吱吱地响了起来时，人们说：“火在笑了！”他们把火笑比做吉祥的征兆，随着火的欢笑，人们的劳动也更紧张，更愉快了！
    西双版纳第一座花岗岩水坝开始在流沙河上修建时，有一块巨岩，炮眼打不进去，炸药炸不开，傣族的老人们说：“这是女水鬼彼朋旭居住的地方，她不愿意搬到别处去！”怎么办呢？水利工程队提出来用火烧，大家砍来了许多大树干，架在这块顽强的石头上，烧了几天几夜，石头起了化学变化，炮眼可以打进去了，炸药起了作用，在震耳欲聋的巨响声中，水鬼彼朋旭被消灭了。又是火，破除了千百年来的迷信。
    茶树林中的火，要算是最最美丽的景色了。为了突击采茶，让茶叶早日下树，不放老，一年间组织了好几次大协作，连夜采摘。寨子里多年不曾参加劳动的老大妈们，拄着拐棍来了，年纪还很小个子只有半截人高的小孩子也来了，和尚来了，佛爷也来了，还有城里那些汉族居民们，机关里的干部们，全都提着马灯点着松明，来到了茶树林中，突击采茶。满坡的灯火，远远看来，全被茶树映绿了。
    火，体现了人们的美丽的理想；火，闪耀着民族之间团结友爱的光辉，它不仅照亮了边疆的茶园，而且也照亮人们的心。今年流沙河水电站开始动工，在西双版纳不久的将来，各族人民的小竹楼上，还要出现一种新的火光——电灯。民间的歌手们，开始用古老的曲调为发电站歌唱。他们说：“火是我们最亲密的朋友，我们的伙伴，为了对火表示尊崇和感恩，我们将为它修建公路盖好楼房，让它永远照耀着中国人民的伟大的理想。”
