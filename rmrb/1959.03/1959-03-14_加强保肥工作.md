    Strengthen Fertilizer Preservation Work
    In order to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture this year, a vigorous upsurge in accumulating and producing fertilizer has been launched in various places, and a lot of fertilizer has been accumulated and produced, which is an important guarantee for achieving agricultural production increase this year.
    However, some places have not paid enough attention to protecting the accumulated fertilizer. Recently, I went to the countryside of Jiujiang County, Jiangxi, and found that a lot of fertilizer was placed in the fields without being properly covered, exposed to wind and rain. According to the experience of farmers, all fertilizer placed outside, if not sealed with mud, should be promptly turned into the soil. Otherwise, the nitrogen in the fertilizer will suffer greater losses, and the fertilizer efficiency will be reduced. I suggest that people's communes in various places conduct an inspection of fertilizer preservation work and promptly store the accumulated fertilizer properly.

    加强保肥工作
    为了争取今年农业的更大更好更全面地跃进，各地掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥造肥高潮，积造了不少肥料，这是实现今年农业增产的重要保证。
    可是，有些地方对已积的肥料，却注意保护不够。最近，我因事到江西九江县的农村去了一趟，发现有不少肥料放在田里没有遮盖好，受着风吹雨淋。根据农民的经验，凡是放在外面的肥料，如果不用泥封住，就要及时把它翻入土内。不然，就会使肥料中的氮素遭受更多的损失，就会减低肥效。我建议各地人民公社，进行一次保肥工作检查，及时把已积的肥料保管好。
