Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The China Juvenile and Children's Publishing House in Beijing and the Juvenile and Children's Publishing House in Shanghai recently jointly launched a徵文 (solicited contributions) campaign for children's literature across the country. They hope that children's literature writers, amateur authors, teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, cadres in various fields, and activists on all fronts will work together to write children's books. This is to promote the creation of children's books and gradually meet the reading needs of the 120 million children and teenagers.

The target audience for this 徵稿 (solicitation) ranges from preschool children (3 years old) to junior high school students (15 years old). The scope of the 徵稿 (solicitation) includes: children's literature creation, including novels, essays, features, poetry, plays, fairy tales, fables, folk stories, etc.; science knowledge reading materials, including basic knowledge of social sciences, travel notes, historical stories, biographies, basic knowledge of natural sciences, science fiction novels, science sketches, science fairy tales, science essays; literary and knowledge reading materials for preschool children; picture albums for preschool and lower grade children and illustrations and cover designs for various children's books.

Excellent children's books are powerful tools for conducting socialist and communist education for children and teenagers. With the development of industry and agriculture nationwide, the increasing popularization of primary and secondary school education, and the widespread establishment of rural kindergartens, the demand for children's books has greatly increased. Relevant parties believe that although the creation and publication of children's books have developed in recent years, they are still far from meeting the needs of this new objective situation. Therefore, creating and publishing more excellent children's books with higher quality and quantity is an urgent task that deserves the vigorous completion of all parties.

    大家为孩子创作好作品
    两个儿童出版社发起儿童读物征文
    新华社17日讯　北京的中国少年儿童出版社和上海的少年儿童出版社最近联合向全国各地发起儿童读物征文，希望全国的儿童文学作家、业余作者、广大教师、少先队辅导员、各方面工作的干部以及各个战线上的积极分子，共同努力来写儿童读物，以繁荣儿童读物的创作，逐步满足一亿二千万少年儿童的阅读需要。
    这次征稿的阅读对象是学龄前儿童（三岁）到初中的学生
  （十五岁）。征稿范围是：儿童文学创作，包括小说、散文、特写、诗歌、剧本、童话、寓言、民间故事等；科学知识读物，包括社会科学基础知识、游记、历史故事、传记、自然科学基础知识、科学幻想小说、科学小品、科学童话、科学散文；学龄前儿童文艺和知识读物；供学龄前儿童和低年级儿童阅读的画册及各种儿童读物的插图、封面设计等。
    优秀的儿童读物，是对少年儿童进行社会主义和共产主义教育的有力工具。随着全国工农业的发展、中小学教育的日益普及、农村幼儿园的普遍建立，儿童读物的需要量大大增加。有关方面认为，近年来，虽然儿童读物的创作和出版都有所发展，但还远不能适应这个新的客观形势发展的需要。因此，创作和出版质量更高和数量更多的优秀儿童读物，是一件迫切需要也值得各个方面来大力完成的工作。
