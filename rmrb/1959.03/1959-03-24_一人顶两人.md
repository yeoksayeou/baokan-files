    One Person Doing the Work of Two
    Liu Di
    Last year, during the Great Leap Forward, Li Tianzhu, a farmer from Huguan County, Shanxi Province, did 615 workdays in one burst of energy. This year, he has again proposed a competition to all farmers in the county to do the work of two people (see *People's Daily*, March 23). In him, we see the increased political awareness of our country’s farmers under the leadership of the Party, and we also feel the infinite power hidden within the masses.
    There are only 365 days in a year, so how could Li Tianzhu have done more than 600 workdays? Does he have three heads and six arms like the legendary Nezha? Does he stay up all night for all 365 days of the year? Of course not. Li Tianzhu's secret is still the well-known word "diligence." Li Tianzhu treats labor with the attitude of a master. All year round, he starts early and ends late, "putting down the rake to pick up the broom," doing whatever he can, and doing whatever he comes across. In his own words, this is called "never walking empty" and "never letting time pass in vain." "Diligence" is not just diligence of the hands and feet, but also diligence of the mind; it is not just daily diligence, but also diligence in all matters. Diligence begets skill, and Li Tianzhu is becoming more and more skilled.
    From this, we get an inspiration. Li Tianzhu proves with living facts that in the laboring people who have liberated their minds and broken superstitions, one does not equal one, but equals two, equals three, equals ten... This principle is becoming clearer day by day. People are the most active factor in productivity, and once their role is fully developed, it can continuously improve labor productivity through continuous technological revolution and promote the development of the entire social productivity. As indicators increase, people's enthusiasm and measures also need to increase. This year's "one" cannot be equal to last year's "one"; today's "one" cannot be equal to yesterday's "one." The objective law of forward development requires people to exert greater subjective initiative. Only by exerting double the effort can we achieve an even greater leap forward this year.
    Recently, many places have proposed that one workday should be equivalent to one and a half or even more than two workdays last year; the amount of work completed by one person should be equivalent to one and a half or even more than two people last year. This is a very good slogan for action. It is entirely possible to do the work of two people with one. Li Tianzhu is an ordinary farmer. He can do more than 600 workdays a year. If everyone thinks about it, discusses it, and then does what Li Tianzhu does, everyone can become Li Tianzhu and surpass Li Tianzhu!
    To do the work of two people with one, and to be able to sustain it, requires strength. Where does the strength lie? In the people, in the minds of the people. The physical strength of a person is limited, but the potential of the mind is endless. People like to compare the brain to a "machine," and as long as this machine is started, it can create miracles. Therefore, to do the work of two people with one, we must not rely on increasing labor intensity, but on this omnipotent "machine." A machine can only rotate quickly if it is lubricated with oil; people's thoughts also need to be constantly lubricated. This "oil" is "politics in command." If thoughts grow by an inch, production grows by a foot. If everyone is armed with socialist and communist ideas, develops the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, carries out a great technological revolution, carries out a great tool reform, and engages in creative labor, then one person can do the work of ten, ten people can do the work of a hundred... Thousands of rivers flow into the sea, forming a magnificent momentum that will push our country's Great Leap Forward wave upon wave, pushing it to a new climax.
    Increasing a person's work efficiency by one-fold is not just about saving some manpower and improving labor efficiency. From this "efficiency," we see the victory of our socialist construction cause coming towards us step by step.

    一人顶两人
    柳笛
    山西省壶关县农民李天柱在去年大跃进中，他一鼓作气做了六百一十五个劳动日；今年，他又向全县农民提出了一人做活顶两人的竞赛倡议。（见3月23日人民日报）在他身上，我们看到了在党的领导下我国农民政治觉悟的提高，也感到了一股蕴藏在群众之中的无穷的力量。
    一年只有三百六十五天，李天柱怎么竟能做了六百多个劳动日呢？难道他像传说里的哪吒一样，生着三头六臂？难道一年三百六十五天，他昼夜不眠？当然不是。李天柱的秘诀，仍然是那人所共知的“勤奋”二字。李天柱完全是用主人翁的态度对待劳动。一年四季，他起早搭黑，“放下耙耙弄扫帚”，能做什么做什么，碰见什么就做什么。用他自己的话说，叫做“路不空走”，“时不空过”。“勤”不只是手勤、脚勤，而且是脑勤；不只是日日勤，而且是事事勤。勤能生巧，李天柱干得越来越巧了。
    从这里，我们得到一个启发。李天柱用活生生的事实证明了：在解放了思想、破除了迷信的劳动人民身上，一不是等于一，而是等于二，等于三，等于十……。这个道理，一天比一天更清楚了。人，是生产力中最活跃的因素，人的作用一旦得到充分的发挥，它就可以通过不断的技术革命，不断地提高劳动生产率，促进整个社会生产力的发展。指标提高了，人们的干劲和措施也需要增加。今年的“一”，不能再等于去年的“一”；今天的“一”，不能再等于昨天的“一”。向前发展了的客观规律，要求人们发挥更大的主观能动作用。只有发挥加倍的力量，才能实现今年更大的跃进。
    最近，许多地方都提出：一个工作日顶去年一个半甚至两个以上的工作日；一个人完成的工作量顶去年一个半甚至两个以上的人完成的工作量。这是一个很好的行动口号。以一当二，是完全可能的。李天柱是一个普通的农民，他一年能够做六百多个劳动日，如果大家都来想一想，议论议论，然后照李天柱那样去做，每一个人都可以成为李天柱，超过李天柱！
    一人顶两人，要顶得住，就需要力量。力量在哪里？在人的身上，在人的脑筋里。人身上的体力是有限的，但思想上的潜力却无穷无尽。人们都喜欢把脑筋比作一部“机器”，只要这部机器开动起来就可以创造出奇迹。因此，一人顶两人，不能靠加强劳动强度，而要靠这部万能的“机器”。机器擦上滑润的油，才可以转动得快；人的思想也需要经常不断地擦油。这“油”，就是“政治挂帅”。思想长一寸，生产长一丈，每个人都用社会主义、共产主义的思想武装起来，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，大闹技术革命，大搞工具改革，进行创造性的劳动，那么，一人当十、十人当百……千百条河川归大海，就会汇成波澜壮阔的声势，把我国的大跃进一浪推一浪，推向新的高潮。
    把一个人的工作效率提高一倍，这不止是节约了一些人力，提高了劳动效率。我们从这种“效率”中，看到了我国社会主义建设事业的胜利一步一步地向我们走来。
