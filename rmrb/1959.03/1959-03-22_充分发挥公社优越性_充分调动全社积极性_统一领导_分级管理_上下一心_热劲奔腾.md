    Give Full Play to the Superiority of the Commune, Fully Mobilize the Enthusiasm of All Members
    Unified Leadership, Decentralized Management, Unity from Top to Bottom, Surge of Enthusiasm
    Huanghua Commune in Hunan and Bailian Commune in Hubei Conscientiously Implement the Sixth Plenary Session Resolution and Set Off a Spring Production Upsurge
    Changsha, March 21st (Our Newspaper Reporters Hu Jian and Li Jinting report): Huanghua People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, recently implemented the methods of unified leadership and decentralized management proposed in the Sixth Plenary Session's resolution on certain issues concerning people's communes. As a result, the broad masses of commune members have thrown themselves into this year's new production upsurge with soaring enthusiasm, further demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune. On March 13th, when reporters visited this commune, it was raining. The fields were filled with voices, and the commune members were busily plowing, building field ridges, preparing rice seedling beds, and transporting fertilizer to the fields, vigorously engaging in spring plowing. According to He Xingwo, the commune party secretary, the attendance rate of the entire commune has increased by 15% and work efficiency by 25% since the implementation of unified leadership and decentralized management. Currently, 80% of the early rice in the entire commune has been soaked, and people are full of confidence in realizing this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan.
    The Huanghua People's Commune is a large commune with more than 10,000 households spanning 60 li, established in September last year. At the beginning of March this year, based on summarizing the tremendous superiority already demonstrated by the people's commune in the past few months, and after discussions by the commune members, this commune decided to adopt the method of unified leadership and decentralized management. In this way, formulating production plans is not only conducive to unified planning for the entire commune, but also more conducive to planting according to local conditions, and enabling the plans to take root among the masses. The production plan of the Huanghua Production Brigade for this year had already been initially implemented among the masses according to the tasks assigned by the commune. However, after the commune members arranged the crop area plot by plot and according to local conditions, they found that although this year's plan was much better than in previous years in terms of planting according to local conditions, there were still some arrangements that were not perfect due to insufficient understanding of the situation. For example, this team has always had the habit of growing tomatoes, but the original plan did not include this item. This time, they decided to grow 40 mu of tomatoes, which is expected to generate more than 20,000 yuan in income. The soil here is most suitable for growing mud beans, so they expanded the plan from the original 80 mu to 200 mu. After such specific revisions and arrangements, the production increase target for the entire team this year increased from the original 1,600 jin of grain per mu to 2,000 jin. Some commune members of this team originally felt that there was a shortage of fertilizer and labor, and planned to temporarily leave more than 1,100 mu of poor-quality paddy fields as leisure land. After the commune members discussed the method of unified leadership and decentralized management, the commune members plowed all the leisure land and applied base fertilizer in a few days, preparing to transplant early rice, and also expanded more than 600 mu of cash crops. If there was a shortage of labor, they vigorously reformed tools. Just the full implementation of local tap water in all 67 public canteens in the entire brigade saved 102 people who had been carrying water. The entire team transferred a total of more than 480 laborers from service departments to the agricultural front. If there was a shortage of fertilizer, they launched a concentrated effort to accumulate soil fertilizer and build local chemical fertilizer. Now, an average of more than 1,000 dan of high-quality fertilizer has been accumulated per mu. If there was a shortage of funds, they found 11 new sideline avenues and organized specialized teams to seize cash income. In March, they will earn more than 10,000 yuan in cash, more than double the amount in February, and they can completely solve the difficulty of production funds themselves. Recently, this team also conducted a comprehensive inspection of the team's production in accordance with the requirement of doubling the yield per mu. They found that more than 400 large field ponds were not made completely up to quality standards, and all of them were reworked.
    From the implementation of unified leadership and decentralized management in this commune, it can be seen that not only has it further mobilized the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, but also further mobilized the work enthusiasm of the commune cadres, especially the team cadres. Cadres at all levels have taken on the responsibility of leading the masses to do a good job in production, and their work has become more solid, meticulous, and in-depth. Cadres participate in production more frequently. The Huanghua Brigade originally had more than 110 cadres who were divorced or semi-divorced from production, now there are only 20 cadres. In the past, there were many cadres, and cadres participated in production, doing an average of just over two points of work per person per day. Now, the number of cadres has been reduced, the work is well arranged, and the time spent participating in production has increased compared to before. In the first half of March, each cadre did an average of seven points of work per day, and some did the same ten points of work as the main labor force. More importantly, the cadres went deep into the fields, discovered problems quickly, and solved problems more promptly. When the reporter went to visit, Liu Zhaonan, the party branch secretary of Hexin Team, was covered in mud and had just returned from the field. He said: "This method is very good. Now every cadre is really working in a down-to-earth manner." He also introduced that the nine cadres of the entire team used to find it difficult to consistently participate in production, but now each cadre does at least half a day's work every day. Cadres going to the fields means that many problems are solved in a timely manner. He cited an example: He said that today in Xujiadong production, some commune members said that this year's spring plowing production is better than any year, and the work is almost done, and they have some complacency. He held a small meeting by the field, pointing out that the fertilizer he found in some fields did not meet the requirement of 1,000 dan of high-quality fertilizer, and some individual fields only had 500 dan per mu. He mobilized everyone to discuss whether this could achieve the double-thousand jin plan. Everyone saw the cadres going to the fields and working with the masses to discover and solve problems in production, and their enthusiasm became even higher. That afternoon, more than 20 people were organized to concentrate on accumulating fertilizer. They must achieve a thousand dan of fertilizer per mu and double-thousand jin of grain.
    Due to unified leadership and decentralized management, it is easier for both commune cadres and commune members to understand their own resources, and everyone pays attention to careful calculation. Therefore, the atmosphere of running the commune diligently and thriftily is also stronger than before. Recently, after discussions among commune members, careful calculations, and opening up new sources of income and reducing expenditures, non-productive expenditures for the entire commune will be reduced a lot compared to the original. The money saved has now been used to buy back more than 7,000 dan of lime and 28 dan of vegetable seeds, preparing to expand the planting of more than 7,000 mu of vegetables, and the problem of pig feed can also be solved. The Huanghua Production Brigade was short of 80 raincoats, and originally planned to have the commune buy them. This time, the commune members calculated the team's income and expenditure plan and found that it would cost 320 yuan, so they decided not to buy them. The commune members automatically collected old raincoats, repaired 65 of them, and wove 15 themselves, so they can still go out to work on rainy days. The Hexin Team originally burned more than 4,500 jin of rice straw every month. This time, the commune members calculated a detailed account and found that 100 jin of rice straw can be sold for more than two yuan. If it is all burned as firewood, it would be a pity. The team's firewood mountain is also convenient, so the commune members took the initiative to propose going up the mountain to cut cogon grass for burning, and this item alone would contribute about 900 yuan to agricultural production every month.
    Now, the commune has launched a production competition between teams. In the production competition, every commune member strives to be at the forefront. The Huilong Production Brigade was originally a backward production team. This time, they built pontoon bridges and cableways to transport fertilizer, and in just over ten days, production caught up and won the mobile red flag. The Longtan Team is a famous "poor team" in the entire commune. Under the concern and help of the commune party committee, everyone is full of enthusiasm and striving for self-improvement. They revised this year's production plan and are determined to change the face of the poor mountains and barren land. They were originally short of more than 160 pieces of agricultural tools, and hoped that the commune would help them add them. Now they have decided not to buy them with money, but to solve it themselves. They collected old agricultural tools, repaired 120 of them, and the commune supported them with 40 pieces, so the problem was solved. Because Zhou Zhaofa, the secretary of the brigade general branch, lives in this team to help them mobilize commune members to come up with ideas and overcome various difficulties in production, everyone's enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. In just over ten days, the average amount of soil fertilizer accumulated per mu has increased from more than 100 dan to more than 700 dan. In particular, the rapeseed and wheat are cultivated very well and have been rated as the red flag team of the entire commune.
    Wuhan, March 21st (Reporter Fang Di reports): After the Bailian People's Commune in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, established a system of unified leadership and decentralized management, it further gave play to the role of the management area and production team, making the entire commune show a vivid situation of a step-by-step production upsurge.
    The Bailian Commune has done a very outstanding job in both agricultural production and diversified management. According to the survey, the entire commune has more than 50,000 mu of wheat fields, which are generally growing vigorously and densely. Among them, about half of the wheat fields already have 800,000 to more than 1 million seedlings per mu, and nearly 40% of the wheat fields have more than 600,000 seedlings per mu. "Third-class fields" with only about 400,000 seedlings per mu—which would have been considered "special-class fields" last year—account for just over 10%. Due to early and good efforts, the entire commune's spring sowing preparation work has now been basically completed. Among them, the base fertilizer for crops such as rice, cotton, and oilseeds has long been fully prepared, and part of the top dressing has also been prepared. The diversified management of each production team is also very active, with dozens of management projects.
    The commune is a much larger and more complex organization than the advanced agricultural cooperative. Therefore, in order to manage the entire commune well, it is necessary to give full play to the role of the three-level organizations of the commune, management area, and production team, especially to give play to the role of the production team as the basic unit for organizing labor and carrying out production. It is precisely from this situation that the Bailian Commune implemented decentralized management under the unified leadership of the commune shortly after its establishment, so that the commune, management area, and production team all have certain powers and responsibilities. For example, the commune, according to the requirements of the national plan, uniformly formulates the commune's production plan and the measures to realize the plan, operates and manages the commune's production, construction, and welfare undertakings, and comprehensively arranges labor and organizes mutual cooperation between management areas; for some of the above projects that do not belong to the commune as a whole and other matters that are not suitable for unified operation and management by the commune, the management area and production team shall operate and manage them according to the commune's unified plan and the needs of the unit. For example, for the agricultural production plan formulated by the commune according to the requirements of the national plan, the management area and production team can decide on the specific measures to complete the production plan according to the specific conditions of the unit, and arrange and adjust by themselves on the premise of ensuring the completion of the output and output value required by the commune, with more planting resulting in more harvest and rewards for overproduction. The management area and production team can manage various sideline occupations suitable for decentralized management according to their needs. After doing so, not only can the commune's leadership organization concentrate its efforts to arrange and organize the commune's work and grasp the main issues related to production and life, but more importantly, the management area and production team, these two levels of organization, can also fully play their roles within the scope of their responsibilities, so that the commune's production will be further developed and the commune organization will be further consolidated.
    The Bailian Commune's unified leadership and decentralized management practices began in early December last year, and achieved obvious results as soon as they were implemented. As the masses said, "Everyone cares about it from top to bottom, and everything is easy to handle."
    The Qingfeng Management Area and its subordinate production teams were not clear about their responsibilities. Later, after the management area and each production team knew that on the premise of ensuring the completion of the output and output value required by the commune's plan, they could arrange and adjust by themselves according to the needs of the unit, and that more planting could result in more harvest and overproduction could be rewarded, their enthusiasm for operation and management greatly improved. In order to increase production, each production team in the entire management area not only strengthened the management of the crops that have been sown, but also tried to reclaim 2,000 mu of wasteland to expand the area of cotton and sesame and other crops; in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer, each production team also organized a special team to accumulate and make fertilizer. After the implementation of the decentralized management method, each production team in the Wusi Management Area greatly strengthened the management of both ploughing cattle and agricultural tools than before. Especially the work in ploughing cattle management was very outstanding, making the cattle pen clear and the cattle strong. In terms of diversified management, in addition to a total of 19 larger projects directly operated by the commune, each management area and production team operated about 15 projects, which greatly activated the diversified management on the premise of ensuring increased agricultural production.
    The confidence and determination of cadres and masses of the whole commune to complete this year's larger, better and more comprehensive leap forward plan is even more firm. They are carrying out the fifth topdressing and weeding of wheat fields with soaring enthusiasm, and accelerating the completion of the final spring sowing preparation work. (Attached photo)

    充分发挥公社优越性　充分调动全社积极性
    统一领导  分级管理  上下一心  热劲奔腾
    湖南黄花社和湖北白莲社切实贯彻六中全会决议掀起春季生产高潮
    本报长沙21日电　本报记者胡坚、李进挺报道：湖南省长沙县黄花人民公社最近实行了党的六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中提出的统一领导、分级管理等办法后，广大社员都以冲天干劲投入今年新的生产热潮，进一步发挥了人民公社的优越性。3月13日，记者到这个公社访问时，正下着雨。田野里人声鼎沸，社员们忙碌地翻耕、搭田塍、整秧田和运肥下田，大闹春耕生产。据公社党委书记何兴沃说，实行统一领导、分级管理以后，全公社出勤率比原来提高了15％，工效提高25％。目前，全公社80％的早稻已经浸种，人们满怀信心实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进规划。
    黄花人民公社是一个拥有一万多户、纵横六十华里的大社，是去年9月间建成的。今年3月初，这个公社在总结人民公社过去几个月已经显示出来的巨大优越性的基础上，经过社员讨论，决定采取统一领导、分级管理的办法。这样一来，制订生产计划既有利于全公社统一规划，也更有利于因地种植，并使计划在群众中落脚生根。黄花生产大队今年的生产规划本来已按公社分配的任务初步贯彻到群众中去了。但是这次经过社员逐丘逐块，因地制宜地安排作物面积后，又发现今年的规划在因地种植方面虽较往年好得多，但由于了解情况不够，还有些安排不够妥善的地方。比如，这个队一向有种番茄的习惯，原来的规划就没有这一项，这次他们决定种四十亩番茄，预计可收入两万多元。这里的泥色最适宜种泥豆，他们就由原计划八十亩扩大到二百亩。经这样具体修订和安排，全队今年增产指标就由原来每亩产粮食一千六百斤增加到二千斤。该队有些社员原来总感到肥料、劳力不足，打算把一千一百多亩土质差的稻田暂时作为休闲地。当社员们讨论统一领导，分级管理的办法后，社员们在几天工夫就把全部休闲地翻耕施上基肥，准备插早稻，还扩大六百多亩经济作物。劳力不足，他们就大闹工具改革，单是全大队六十七个公共食堂全部推行土自来水，就节约一百零二个挑水的劳动力，全队从服务性部门共抽调四百八十多个劳动力到农业战线上来。肥料不足，他们突击积土肥，大造土化肥，现在平均每亩已积了一千多担优质肥料。资金不足，他们新找出十一项副业门路，组织专业队抓现金收入，3月份他们将收入现金一万多元，较2月份增加一倍多，自己完全可以解决生产资金的困难。最近这个队又按照亩产双千斤的要求，对全队生产进行了全面检查。他们发现四百多个田间大凼做得不完全合质量标准，又全部返了工。
    从这个公社实行统一领导、分级管理来看，不仅更加调动了广大社员的生产积极性，而且进一步调动了社干部特别是队干部的工作积极性，各级干部都挑起担子，领导群众搞好生产，工作更加踏实、细致和深入了，干部参加生产更加经常了。黄花大队原有一百一十多名脱产和半脱产的干部，现在只有二十名干部了。过去干部多，干部参加生产平均每人每天只做二分多工。现在干部减少，工作安排得好，参加生产的时间比以前增加。3月上半月平均每个干部每天做了七分工，有的和主要劳动力同样做十分工。更重要的是干部深入田间，发现问题快，解决问题也更及时了。记者去访问时，合心队的党支部书记柳兆南满身泥污，刚从田间回来。他说：“这种做法好得很，现在每个干部都真正落落实实工作。”他还介绍全队九个干部过去参加生产不容易经常坚持下去，现在每个干部每天至少做半天工夫。干部下田，许多问题得到及时解决。他举例说：他今天在许家洞生产，有些社员说，今年春耕生产赛过任何一年，工夫做得差不多了，有些自满情绪。他就在田边开了个小会，摆出他发现的有些田里的肥料，按优质肥要求不到一千担，个别田每亩只有五百担。他发动大家讨论这样能不能实现双千斤计划。大家看到干部下田和群众在一起发现和解决生产中的问题，干劲更加高涨起来。当天下午就组织二十多人突击积肥，他们一定要实现亩亩千担肥、双千斤粮。
    由于统一领导、分级管理，社干部和社员都比较容易摸清自己的家底，大家都注意精打细算，因此勤俭办社的风气也较前更为浓厚了。最近各队经过社员讨论，精打细算，开源节流的结果，全公社非生产性开支将比原来减少很多。节余下来的钱，现在买回七千多担石灰和二十八担蔬菜种子，准备扩种七千多亩蔬菜，养猪饲料问题也可以得到解决。黄花生产大队缺少八十件蓑衣，原来打算由公社去买，这次社员们在讨论全队收支计划中，计算一下要三百二十块钱，就决定不买了。社员自动收集旧蓑衣整修好六十五件，自己编制十五件，雨天同样可以出工。合心队原来每月烧稻草四千五百多斤，这次社员一算细帐，一百斤稻草可卖两块多钱，如果都当柴烧了太可惜，队里柴山又方便，社员们就主动提出上山砍茅柴烧，单这一项每月就有约九百多元投入到农业生产上去。
    现在，公社开展了队与队之间的生产竞赛。社员们在生产竞赛中个个力争走在最前列。回龙生产大队原来是个生产落后队，这次他们架起浮桥、索道运肥料，十多天工夫，生产就赶上来了，夺得了流动红旗。龙潭队是全公社有名的“穷队”，他们在公社党委的关怀和帮助下，个个干劲冲天，奋发图强。他们修订了今年的生产计划，决心改变穷山瘠土的面貌。他们原来缺少一百六十多件农具，希望公社帮他们添置。现在他们决定不用钱买，自己来解决。他们收集旧农具整修好一百二十件，公社支援他们四十件，问题就解决了。由于大队总支书记周兆发住在这个队里帮助他们发动社员出主意，克服生产中的各种困难，大家干劲越来越大，十多天中，平均每亩积土肥由原来一百多担增加到七百多担。特别是油菜、麦子培育得很出色，被评为全公社的红旗队。
    本报武汉21日电　记者方堤报道：湖北省光化县白莲人民公社建立统一领导、分级管理的制度后，进一步发挥了管理区和生产队的作用，使整个公社出现了生产高潮步步高的生动局面。
  白莲公社的农业生产和多种经营都搞得十分出色。据调查，全社共有麦田五万多亩，普遍生长得茁壮茂密，其中有大约一半的麦田每亩已有苗达八十多万株到一百多万株，还有将近40％的麦田每亩有苗六十万株以上；每亩只有四十万株左右的“三类田”——去年这要算“特类田”——只占10％稍强。全社的春播准备工作，由于抓得早和抓得好，现在已经基本完成；其中稻、棉、油料等作物的底肥更早已全部备齐，追肥也已准备了一部分。各生产队的多种经营也搞得很活跃，经营项目达几十种之多。
    公社是比高级农业社庞大、复杂得多的组织。因此，为了把整个公社管理好，必须充分发挥公社、管理区和生产队这三级组织的作用，特别是要发挥作为组织劳动和进行生产的基本单位的生产队的作用。正是从这种情况出发，白莲公社建立后不久，就在公社的统一领导下实行了分级管理，使公社、管理区、生产队都有一定的权限和责任范围。例如，公社根据国家计划的要求，统一制订全社的生产规划和实现规划的措施，经营和管理全社性的生产、建设和福利事业，以及统筹安排劳动力和组织管理区间的相互协作等；对于上述项目中的一些不属于全社性的和其它一些不宜于由公社统一经营管理的事，则分别由管理区和生产队根据公社统一规划和本单位的需要来经营管理。例如，对公社根据国家计划要求制订的农业生产规划，管理区和生产队可以根据本单位的具体情况，因地制宜地决定完成生产规划的具体措施，并在保证完成公社要求的产量、产值的条件下自行安排和调剂，多种多收，超产受奖。管理区和生产队可以根据需要经营各种宜于分散经营的副业，这样作以后，不仅公社的领导组织能够集中力量来安排和组织全社性的工作，抓好有关生产和生活的主要问题，更重要的是，管理区和生产队这两级组织，也能够在自己的职责范围内充分地发挥作用，从而使全社生产进一步地得到发展，促使公社组织进一步巩固。
    白莲公社的统一领导、分级管理的作法是从去年12月上旬开始实行的，一实行就收到了明显的效果。正如群众所说的一样：“上上下下齐操心，什么事情都好办”。
    庆丰管理区和它所属各生产队，原来对自己的职责范围不明确，后来，管理区和各生产队知道在保证完成公社规划要求的产量、产值的前提下，可以根据本单位的需要自行安排和调剂，而且多种可以多收、超产可以受奖后，经营管理的积极性就大为提高了。为了多增产，全管理区的各个生产队除加强了对已播作物的管理外，还想办法新开荒二千亩，来扩大棉花和芝麻等作物的面积；为了解决肥料不足的困难，各生产队还组织了专门班子来积肥和造肥。五四管理区各生产队在实行分级管理的办法后，无论是对耕牛和农具的管理都比原来大为加强，特别是在耕牛管理方面的工作很出色，作到了栏清牛壮。在多种经营方面，除了公社直接经营的较大的项目共十九种外，各管理区和生产队经营了大约十五个左右的项目，从而使多种经营在保证农业增产的条件下大大地活跃了起来。
    全社干部和群众对完成今年更大更好更全面的跃进规划的信心和决心是更加坚定了，他们正以冲天的干劲对麦田进行第五次追肥、锄草和加速完成最后的春播准备工作。（附图片）
