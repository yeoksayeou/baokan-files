Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 1st: The South Arabian People's League office in Cairo issued a statement today saying that rebellious Awalik tribesmen, under the leadership of Chief Abu Bakr bin Farid, have gathered in many mountain areas. The statement also said that nationalists have fought with the British colonial army in Awalik.

British aircraft continue to bomb villages and cities in the Lower Yafa Sultanate. However, Prince Muhammad bin Edarus refuses to surrender or recognize the so-called "federation" recently cobbled together by the British.

Nationalists led by Prince Hedra bin Nasser have launched several attacks on British troops in Dhala. In Danina, nationalists attacked British mercenaries, killing two and wounding three.

At the same time, nationalist elements have issued warnings to those Sultans who recognize the British puppet "federation." Arabs in Aden held demonstrations against the rebellious Sultans and hung black flags in the streets to protest against the establishment of the "federation," the separation of Aden from other parts of South Arabia, and the attempt to keep it under British rule.

The South Arabian People's League office also said that, on the other hand, with the development of the struggle against the British puppet "federation" there, new British reinforcements composed of mercenaries arrived in Aden last week to reinforce the British invading forces in South Arabia.

    民族主义者展开武装斗争
    新华社开罗1日电　南阿拉伯人民联盟驻开罗办事处今天发表声明说，起义的阿瓦莱奥部族居民在阿布·巴克尔·本·法里德酋长的领导下已经在许多山岭上面集结。声明还说，民族主义者同英国殖民军在阿瓦莱奥进行了战斗。
    英国飞机继续对下亚菲苏丹国的村庄和城市进行空袭。但是穆罕默德·本·埃达鲁斯亲王拒绝投降或者承认英国最近拼凑的所谓“联邦”。
    由赫德拉·本·纳赛尔亲王率领的民族主义者在达勒对英国军队展开了多次进攻。在达尼纳，民族主义者袭击了英国雇佣兵，打死了两名和打伤了三名。
    同时，民族主义分子已经向那些承认英傀儡“联邦”的苏丹提出了警告。亚丁的阿拉伯人举行了示威反对叛逆的苏丹，并且在街道上悬挂黑旗抗议成立“联邦”和把亚丁同南阿拉伯其他地方分开以及使它继续处在英国统治下的企图。
    南阿拉伯人民联盟办事处还说，另一方面，随着那里反对英傀儡“联邦”的斗争的发展，由雇佣兵组成的英国新的增援部队已经在上星期开到亚丁，增援在南阿拉伯的英国侵略军。
