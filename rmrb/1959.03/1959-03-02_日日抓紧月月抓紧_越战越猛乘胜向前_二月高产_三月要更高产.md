Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 1st: The four large fixed-type open-hearth furnaces newly put into production at Anshan Iron and Steel Works last year overfulfilled the state steel production plan for February ahead of schedule, and in the last three days of February, they took advantage of the victory to advance rapidly and achieved another great victory. The total cumulative increase in high-quality steel for the state in the whole month was 10,496 tons.

After completing the steel production plan for February, the workers of each furnace immediately put forward the fighting slogan of "Don't slack off after completing the task, fight hard for three days to seize 10,000 tons." Everyone was in high spirits and fought more and more vigorously, so that steel production increased day by day. According to calculations, in the three days from the 26th to the 28th, the average daily output of the four open-hearth furnaces increased by more than 700 tons compared with the average daily output in the first 25 days of February.

For the past three days, there has been a tense atmosphere inside and outside each open-hearth furnace. The molten steel was boiling in the furnace, and outside were locomotives. The crane workers posted guarantee letters on the charging machines, determined to produce more steel in the shortest possible time. All leading cadres also went to the front line to fight day and night with the workers. Each furnace, due to the use of advanced operating techniques such as pre-slagging, increasing furnace temperature, and multi-charging and rapid refining, created an unprecedented new record of five heats of steel per shift on the 28th.

The workers of each furnace, who sent off February with excellent results, are now deploying new battles. They are ambitious and full of energy, determined to push production to a higher level in March, and strive for red every day, red every ten days, and red throughout the season.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 1st: Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which has maintained the highest utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the country for ten consecutive months, overfulfilled the February pig iron production plan by more than 920 tons; the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces for the whole month reached 2.212 tons, an increase of 10% compared with January, continuing to lead the country.

In February, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant encountered a series of difficulties on the road to advancement. However, the sense of glory in maintaining honor and the revolutionary enterprising spirit made the entire plant act in unison and open fire on difficulties. At the beginning of the month, the sintering powder rate of iron ore was particularly high, and a large amount of powder blocked the air holes in the furnace, making it impossible to increase the smelting intensity, which greatly affected the output. However, the sintering workers quickly took on the task of reducing the ore powder rate, strictly strengthened the management of ore powder classification, sieving, and sintering, checking every step and not allowing any slack, so that the sintering powder rate was reduced from 4.8% to 2.5%, ensuring the increase in output. With the increase in pig iron production, the supply of cast iron machine parts could not keep up, so the leadership transferred a workshop director to specialize in the production of cast ironware, and also transferred workers from other workshops to assist the machine repair department in producing cast iron spare parts to ensure the needs of iron tapping.

The workers of the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, due to mastering the characteristics of the two old blast furnaces, cleverly and bravely controlled them, demanding that they spew out more iron for the country. The two furnaces have different characteristics: one is honest and loyal, and the other is extremely sensitive. Since the implementation of advanced experience in improving smelting intensity, the air intake has been increased, and the tuyeres of No. 1 furnace have become increasingly prone to damage. The workers immediately took measures to change the straight tuyeres to flared ones, and appropriately enlarged the diameter of the tuyeres. After this change, the air intake was uniform, and the utilization coefficient increased rapidly.

The workers of the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, who overfulfilled the February plan, have now put forward higher goals: determined to increase the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces to more than 2.3 this year, and strive to reach 2.4, and use this as a condition for competing with iron and steel plants across the country.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company separately overfulfilled steel and iron production plans for February ahead of schedule on the 25th and 27th; according to statistics up to the end of February, they produced more than 1,800 tons of steel and more than 1,000 tons of iron for the country.

At the beginning of this year, the company actively mobilized the masses to launch a competition boom centered on iron and steel production, and all employees formed a new atmosphere of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and promoting each other. Workers in the iron smelting plant tried every means to increase the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces. In the case of insufficient coke supply, they promoted advanced experience of reducing batch sizes and lowering coke ratios in various blast furnaces, which not only did not reduce output due to insufficient coke, but also increased pig iron output compared to the past. According to statistics, in the first ten days of February, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in this factory increased by 6.8% compared with the first ten days of January, and in the middle ten days of February, it increased by 4% compared with the middle ten days of January. Due to the increase in the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, the average daily output of pig iron in February increased by 120 tons compared with the average daily output in January.

Actively mobilizing the masses to break through the weak links in production is also an important reason why the company completed the February production plan quickly and well. Workers in the converter workshop took various measures to break through the steel quality barrier. In February, under the conditions of declining silicon content in pig iron and strict quality requirements, the qualification rate of steel ingots reached 100%.

Now the company's employees are launching a production upsurge with greater enthusiasm, comprehensively discussing this year's national plan, tapping production potential, and increasing steel production.

    日日抓紧月月抓紧　越战越猛乘胜向前
    二月高产  三月要更高产
    鞍钢四大平炉二月份最后三天又获大捷
    本溪第一钢铁厂高炉利用系数继续领先
    石景山钢铁公司提前超额完成二月计划
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍钢去年新投入生产的四座大型固定式炼钢平炉提前完成2月份国家产钢计划后，在2月份的最后三天，乘胜急进，又获大捷。全月累计共为国家增产了一万零四百九十六吨优质钢。
    各炉职工在完成了2月份钢产量计划之后，马上提出了“完成任务不松劲，大战三天夺万吨”的战斗口号。大家斗志昂扬，越战越猛，使钢的产量日日上升。根据计算，在26日到28日的三天里，四座平炉的平均日产量比2月份前二十五天的平均日产量增加了七百多吨。
    三天以来，各个平炉的台上台下一片紧张。钢水在炉子里沸腾着，外面是机车，吊钢工人们把保证书贴在装料机上，决心用最短的时间炼出更多的钢。所有领导干部也都亲临前线，和工人一起日夜奋战。各个炉子由于运用了提前造渣，提高炉温和多装快炼等先进操作技术，在28日曾经创造了一班出钢五炉的空前新纪录。
    以优异成绩送走了2月份的各炉职工，现在正在布置新的战斗。他们雄心勃勃，干劲冲天，决心在3月份里把生产推向更高的水平，力争日日红，旬旬红，全季红。新华社本溪1日电　曾经连续十个月保持全国高炉利用系数最高纪录的本溪第一钢铁厂，超额九百二十多吨完成了2月份生铁生产计划；高炉利用系数全月平均达到二点二一二吨，比1月份提高10％，继续在全国领先。
    2月份，本溪第一钢铁厂在前进的道路上遇到一系列的困难。可是，保持荣誉的光荣感和革命的进取心，使得全厂上下行动一致，向困难开火。月初，铁矿烧结粉末率特别高，大量粉末堵塞了炉内的气孔，冶炼强度提不高，产量大受影响。但是烧结工人很快地挑起了降低矿粉率的担子，严格加强矿粉分级、过筛、烧结的管理工作，道道检查，寸步不让，使烧结粉末从4.8％降低到2.5％，保证了产量的提高。随着生铁生产的增长，铸铁机零件供应不上，领导上就抽调一个车间主任去专门管理铸铁器的生产，并且从其他车间抽调工人协助机修部门生产铸铁备件，保证了出铁需要。
    第一钢铁厂的职工由于掌握了两座老高炉的性格，机智、勇敢地驾驭着它，要它为国家吐出更多的铁水。两座炉子的性格各有不同，一个炉子老实忠厚，一个炉子敏感万分。自从推行提高冶炼强度的先进经验之后，加大了进风量，一号炉的风口越来越容易坏了；工人们马上采取措施，把直形风口改为喇叭形，并且适当地扩大了风口的直径。经这么一改，进风均匀，利用系数迅速提高。
    超额完成2月份计划的第一钢铁厂的职工们，现在又提出了更高的奋斗目标：决心在今年把高炉利用系数平均提高到二点三以上，争取达到二点四，并且以此作为同全国炼铁厂竞赛的条件。
    新华社28日讯　石景山钢铁公司职工分别在25日、27日提前超额完成了2月份的钢和铁的生产计划；据到2月底的统计，他们共为国家多生产了一千八百多吨钢和一千多吨铁。
    今年一开始，这个公司就积极发动群众掀起了一个以钢铁生产为中心的竞赛热潮，全体职工形成了学先进、赶先进、互相促进的新气象。炼铁厂职工想尽各种办法提高高炉利用系数。他们在焦炭供应不足的情况下，在各个高炉都推行了减小料批，降低焦比的先进经验，不仅没有因为焦炭不足而降低产量，反而使生铁产量比过去提高。据统计，2月上旬这个厂的高炉利用系数比1月份上旬提高了6.8％，2月中旬又比1月中旬提高了4％。由于高炉利用系数的提高，2月份生铁的平均日产量比1月份平均日产量增加了一百二十吨。
    积极发动群众突破生产中的薄弱环节，也是这个公司又快又好的完成2月份生产计划的重要原因。转炉车间职工采取各种措施突破钢的质量关，2月份在生铁含矽量下降、质量要求严格的条件下，使钢锭合格率达到百分之百。
    现在这个公司职工正以更大的热情掀起一个全面讨论今年国家计划、挖掘生产潜力、提高钢铁产量的生产高潮。（附图片）
