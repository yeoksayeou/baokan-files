Shandong

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 3rd. Recently, more than 24,000 cadres in Shandong Province have been sent down to communes and factories to be commune members or workers.

Among these cadres sent down, there are many leading cadres. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, led Xie Hua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, and nine cadres above the level of director from various departments of provincial-level organs to the Dongjiao Commune in Licheng County to be commune members on February 15th. Zhu Qimin, Secretary of the Linyi Prefectural Party Committee, Li Yongchen, Secretary-General of the Prefectural Party Committee, Zhang Ming, member of the Prefectural Party Committee Standing Committee and Commander of the Military Sub-district; Chen Hongbo, First Secretary of the Changwei Prefectural Party Committee, and Wei Jianyi, Deputy Secretary; Li Wen, First Secretary of the Yantai Prefectural Party Committee, and a large number of responsible cadres have also gone to the people's communes to be commune members. Of the 92 cadres above the level of county party secretary in the Liaocheng Prefectural Party Committee, 41 have been sent down to communes and factories to be commune members or workers. The duration of this cadre assignment is generally two to three months; one month for leading cadres above the level of county party secretary.

After being sent down to communes and factories, leading cadres at all levels appeared as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the masses, participating in production and leading production, which played a significant role in promoting current production and rectification of communes. Commune members of Dongjiao Commune said, "Working with the Provincial Party Secretary makes us happy from the bottom of our hearts, and we don't feel tired no matter how hard we work." Under the direct leadership of Comrade Shu Tong, this commune put forward the battle slogan of "3,000 jin target, 6,000 jin measures, 12,000 jin of effort," determined to strive for this year's wheat production to achieve "one season equals one year." Gao Deming, Deputy Secretary of the Boxing County Party Committee, was sent down to the Second Production Team of the Hubin Commune to be a commune member, and he still worked in the rain. The commune members said with emotion, "The Communist Party's cadres and the masses are truly of one heart and one mind, we must make another effort." While working in the Hubin Commune, this deputy secretary also learned production techniques from the old farmers. Zhu Qimin, Secretary of the Linyi Prefectural Party Committee, went to the Daling Management Area of the Suhe Commune, and the next morning he went to the wheat fields to participate in topdressing, which encouraged the cadres and masses of the entire management area, and they completed the plan to water all the wheat fields once and topdress each mu with 10,000 jin seven days ahead of schedule.

The assignment of leading cadres to be commune members and workers has enabled many grassroots cadres to further improve their leadership style. After hearing the news that Comrade Shu Tong had gone to the Dongjiao Commune in Licheng County to be a commune member, the grassroots cadres in Licheng County unanimously expressed that they would learn from the style of the Provincial Party Secretary, work hard, and work in a down-to-earth manner. The cadres of each commune management area decided to participate in labor for 150 days throughout the year, and the cadres of each production team also said that they would work with the team every day of the year except when attending meetings.

Yunnan

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 3rd. After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee immediately took measures to decide to send down a batch of cadres to factories and rural people's communes as workers and commune members. Since mid-January, Xie Fuzhi, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, has led a group of leading cadres to participate in labor in people's communes such as Penglai in Yiliang, Banqiao in Baoshan, and Xiba in Kunming, while helping to rectify the communes and solve production problems, and using this to guide the rectification and production of the entire province.

After Xie Fuzhi and the Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee and others arrived at the Penglai Production Team of the Yongxin Brigade of the Penglai Commune in Yiliang, they lived in the home of a poor peasant commune member surnamed Duan. Every day, in addition to working in the fields with the commune members, they also held discussions with commune members, grassroots cadres, and commune cadres. In this way, many new problems were discovered and solved in a timely manner. For example, regarding issues such as the commune system, the management authority of the commune and teams, and distribution policies, the ideas of commune cadres, grassroots cadres, and the masses were not completely the same. After Xie Fuzhi discovered this, he convened cadres and activists for discussions to help everyone unify their understanding and put forward many solutions to specific problems. At the same time, after some specific policy issues were put into practice and proved to be feasible, they summarized the experience with everyone and wrote it into formal regulations, which were discussed and approved by the Provincial Party Committee meeting and sent to party committees at all levels throughout the province. In this way, it was of great help to the rectification work in various parts of the province. Xie Fuzhi also constantly studied issues such as the commune's production and cadre style, and gave guidance in a timely manner.

Currently, many responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and secretaries of prefectural and county party committees have gone to factories and rural areas to participate in labor. At the same time, according to the Provincial Party Committee's regulations that all cadres should participate in labor, cadres have now begun to be sent down to factories and rural areas in batches to participate in labor throughout the province.

Guangdong

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 3rd. Guangdong Province is sending down a large number of cadres to the front lines of production to carry out labor training and strengthen the leadership of grassroots work. The first batch of more than 45,000 cadres to be sent down have successively arrived at their destinations. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, has also taken the lead in going to Zhongshan County to serve as the First Secretary of the County Party Committee.

Among the first batch of cadres sent down in the province this year, cadres above the level of division and section chief account for a large proportion. In the first batch sent down from the directly affiliated organs of the province alone, there are more than 800 bureau chiefs, division chiefs, and section chiefs. Except for a small number of these cadres who serve as leaders in grassroots units, most of them go to communes, farms, factories, and mines to be commune members and workers, directly participating in production labor.

In order to further improve the system of cadres participating in labor training, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently decided that county party committee members and leaders at all levels equivalent to this level in organs, enterprises, and institutions above the county level in the province must take turns being sent down to be commune members and workers for one month each year; other staff members of these organs are also sent down in batches to be commune members or workers for about one year. Efforts should be made to ensure that all cadres have the opportunity to be trained within a certain period of time. In order to strengthen the leadership of grassroots work, especially the leadership of communes, the Provincial Party Committee also decided that county party committee members and leaders at all levels equivalent to this level in organs, enterprises, and institutions above the county level in the province, in addition to being sent down to be commune members and workers, should also take turns being sent down to work in grassroots units in batches, each period lasting half a year to one year.

The cadres who have been sent down to the countryside and factories have immediately devoted themselves to the current tense spring production in the posture of ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the masses. Their exemplary actions have greatly inspired the morale of the masses and promoted the current production. County party secretaries, county party committee members, and other cadres sent down to various communes in Leinan County are conducting experimental fields together with the masses and technicians in order to lead agricultural production throughout the county. The Xinhe Management Area of the Tonghu Commune in Huilu County did not perform very well in the past. After Huang Guansheng, the secretary of the commune party committee, was sent down to this management area, he fully mobilized the masses and set an example by accumulating fertilizer in the rain, which greatly inspired the enthusiasm of all commune members. Now each person accumulates 820 dan of fertilizer per day, more than doubling the past amount. (Attached picture)

    开上第一线参加生产领导生产
    成千上万干部到公社到工厂当社员当工人同群众打成一片
    山东云南广东省委第一书记和各级党委书记带头到公社劳动到基层工作
    山东
    本报济南3日电　山东省最近有两万四千多名干部下放到公社、工厂去当社员或工人。
    在这批下放干部中，有许多领导干部。中共山东省委第一书记舒同，在2月15日率领省委副秘书长谢华和省级机关各部门处长以上干部九人，到历城县东郊公社当社员。中共临沂地委书记朱奇民，地委秘书长李永臣，地委常委、军分区司令员张明三；中共昌潍地委第一书记陈洪波、副书记魏坚毅；中共烟台地委第一书记李文等大批负责干部，也都先后到人民公社当社员。中共聊城地委共有县委书记以上干部九十二人，这次有四十一人下放到公社、工厂当社员或工人。这次干部下放的时间一般为两个月到三个月；县委书记以上领导干部为一个月。
    各级领导干部下放到公社、工厂以后，都以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众同吃同住同劳动，参加生产和领导生产，对当前的生产和整社工作起了很大的推动作用。东郊公社的社员们说：“和省委书记一块干活，内心里发乐，再累也不觉疲倦了。”这个社在舒同同志直接领导下，提出了“三千斤指标，六千斤措施，一万二千斤干劲”的战斗口号，决心争取今年小麦生产达到“一季顶一年”。中共博兴县委副书记高德明下放到湖滨公社第二生产队当社员，下雨天他也照样干活。社员们感动地说：“共产党的干部和群众真是一心一意，咱们必须再鼓一把劲。”这位副书记在湖滨公社一面劳动，一面向老农学习生产技术。临沂地委书记朱奇民下放到涑河公社大岭管理区后，第二天一清早就到麦田里参加追肥，鼓舞了全管理区的干部群众，他们提前七天完成了把全部麦田浇一次水、每亩追肥一万斤的计划。
    领导干部下放当社员当工人，使许多基层干部进一步改进了自己的领导作风。历城县的基层干部们，听到舒同同志到历城东郊公社当社员的消息以后，一致表示要学习省委书记的作风，大干苦干扎扎实实地干。各公社管理区的干部决定每人全年参加劳动一百五十天，各生产队的干部们也表示，除参加会议外，全年要天天跟班劳动。云　南
  本报昆明3日电　党的六中全会以后，中共云南省委即采取措施决定下放一批干部到工厂、农村人民公社当工人、社员。省委第一书记谢富治同志自1月中旬以来，带领一批领导干部先后到宜良蓬莱、保山板桥、昆明西坝等人民公社参加劳动，同时帮助整社和解决生产问题，并以此指导全省的整社和生产。
    谢富治同志和省委秘书长等，到了宜良蓬莱公社永新大队蓬莱生产队后，就住在一个姓段的贫农社员家里。每天他们除了和社员一道到田里劳动外，还分别与社员、基层干部、公社干部进行座谈。这样，许多新问题都及时发现，并加以解决。例如对公社体制、社队管理权限、分配政策等问题，公社干部、基层干部和群众的想法都不完全一样。谢富治同志发现后，就召集干部、积极分子座谈，帮助大家统一认识，并提出了许多解决具体问题的办法。同时，一些具体政策问题，在拿到群众中经过实践检验证明可行之后，就同大家一道进一步总结经验，写成正式规定，经省委会议讨论通过，发到了全省各级党委。这样，对全省各地的整社工作有很大帮助。对公社的生产、干部作风等问题，谢富治同志也不断进行研究，并及时给以指导。
    目前，省委的许多负责同志和地、县委书记都分别到工厂、农村参加劳动。同时，根据省委全体干部都要参加劳动的规定，现在全省各地已开始分批下放干部到工厂、农村劳动。广　东
    本报广州3日电　广东省下放大批干部到生产第一线，进行劳动锻炼和加强基层工作的领导力量。决定第一批下放的四万五千多名干部，已陆续到达下放地点。广东省委第一书记陶铸，也已经带头下放到中山县担任县委第一书记。
    今年全省下放的第一批干部中，处、科级以上干部占很大比重，仅省直属机关第一批下放的厅、局长和处、科长就有八百多人。这批下放干部除少数人到基层单位担任领导职务外，大部分都到公社、农场、工厂、矿山去当社员和当工人，直接参加生产劳动。
    为了进一步健全干部参加劳动锻炼的制度，中共广东省委最近决定，全省县以上机关和企业、事业单位中的县委委员和相当于这一级以上的各级领导干部，每人每年都要轮流下放当社员、工人一个月；这些机关的其他工作人员也分期分批下放当一年左右的社员或工人。争取在一定的时间内，使所有干部都能够得到锻炼的机会。为了加强对基层工作的领导，特别是加强对公社的领导，省委还决定全省县以上机关、企业和事业单位中的县委委员和相当于这一级的领导干部，除了下放当社员、工人外，还要分期分批轮流下放到基层单位工作，每期下放半年到一年。
    已经下放到农村、工厂的干部，都以普通劳动者的姿态，立刻投入到当前紧张的春季生产中，和群众同吃同住同劳动。他们的模范行动极大地鼓舞了群众的斗志，推动了当前的生产。雷南县下放到各公社的县委书记、县委委员和其他干部和群众、技术员一起大搞试验田，以此来领导全县的农业生产。惠陆县潼湖公社新和管理区，过去生产不很出色。公社党委书记黄观生下放到这个管理区后，由于充分发动群众，并以身作则冒雨积肥，大大鼓舞了全体社员的干劲。现在每人每天积肥八百二十担，比过去增加一倍多。（附图片）
