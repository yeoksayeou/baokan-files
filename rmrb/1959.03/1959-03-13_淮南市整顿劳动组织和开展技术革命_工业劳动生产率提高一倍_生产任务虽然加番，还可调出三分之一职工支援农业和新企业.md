Huainan City Rectifies Labor Organization and Carries Out Technical Revolution
Industrial Labor Productivity Doubles
While Production Tasks are Increased, One-Third of Employees Can Be Transferred to Support Agriculture and New Enterprises

(Our report) News from the front: In Huainan City, Anhui Province, after the rectification of labor organization in various industrial and mining enterprises during January and February this year, industrial labor productivity has increased by an average of more than double. Now, the city is completing the task of doubling this year's production and construction, not only without increasing personnel, but also able to transfer one-third of the employees, a total of more than 61,000 people, to support agricultural production and new enterprises. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site conference in Huainan City in early March to promote their experience.

Huainan City added a large number of new employees last year. Many industrial and mining enterprises experienced varying degrees of waste due to the improper arrangement and use of labor. However, this year, many enterprise leaders have requested a large increase in personnel. In order to ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, according to the instructions of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Huainan Municipal Committee decided to fully mobilize the masses and launch a movement to rectify labor organization throughout the city, tap the potential strength of enterprises, improve labor efficiency, achieve increased production and tasks without increasing personnel, and reduce personnel.

In this movement, employees of industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city wrote a total of 180,000 big-character posters, raising 210,000 suggestions, exposing the phenomenon of waste of labor, and also put forward many useful suggestions. Transport workers at the Jiulonggang Mine suggested merging the 22 small groups in the transportation area into 12 groups, which would not affect the task and could reduce more than 200 people. Through mass airing of views, debates, and on-site trials, each enterprise formulated a new and more reasonable staffing quota plan. For example, the direct production workers of the 8-cubic-meter blast furnace in the Dongfeng Steel Plant were reduced from the original 72 people (three shifts) to 25.5 people; the 13-cubic-meter blast furnace was reduced from 90 people to 30 people. The Huainan Mining Bureau changed the proportion of auxiliary workers accounting for 55% and production workers accounting for 45% to production workers accounting for 55% and auxiliary workers accounting for 45%. After the Xieji集一 Mine Coking Plant implemented the new staffing quota plan, the labor efficiency per person per month reached 19.9 tons, an average increase of 165% compared with last year, and personnel can be reduced by 38.6%.

The specific measures taken by various enterprises to improve labor efficiency and reduce personnel, in addition to focusing on reducing auxiliary personnel, merging institutions, implementing concurrent operations, and cross-operations, also vigorously carried out tool reform and technical reform movements. According to incomplete statistics, more than 200 reform projects have been implemented, and the labor force saved in this area alone amounts to more than 16,000 people. Ironmaking and coking enterprises promoted technical reforms, aggressively tackling the difficult problems of heavy physical labor such as crushing, charging, transporting, and ramming, achieving "mechanized charging by winches, mechanized crushing, and motorized transportation." The Xieji集一 Mine Coking Plant successfully trial-produced electric coal screening machines, ramming machines, and brick-making machines to replace manual operation, plus overhead cable transportation and motorized transportation, the labor productivity increased by more than two times, and the personnel were reduced by 44%. In technical reform, each enterprise adhered to the principle of moving from simple to complex, from indigenous to foreign, using indigenous methods where possible, and using foreign methods where possible, and strived for self-reliance to solve the problems of equipment, technology, and raw materials.

As of the end of February, nearly 40,000 people had been transferred from the city: more than 2,000 people were added to the city's newly built and expanded enterprises, 22,000 people supported agricultural production in nearby areas, and 15,000 people participated in the Huai River diversion project. More than 20,000 people will be transferred successively in March and April.

After rectifying the labor organization, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. At present, employees of various enterprises have successively put forward various challenges, responses, and leap forward guarantee conditions. A socialist competition movement centered on technological revolution is vigorously developing.

    淮南市整顿劳动组织和开展技术革命
    工业劳动生产率提高一倍
    生产任务虽然加番，还可调出三分之一职工支援农业和新企业
    本报讯　安徽省淮南市各工矿企业，经过今年1、2月间整顿劳动组织，工业劳动生产率平均提高一倍以上。现在，全市完成今年生产建设翻一番的任务，不仅不要增加人员，还可以抽调三分之一的职工，共六万一千多人，支援农业生产和新建企业。中共安徽省委3月上旬在淮南市召开了现场会议，推广他们的经验。
    淮南市去年增加了很大数量的新职工，许多工矿企业由于劳动力没有得到妥善的安排和使用，存在着不同程度的浪费现象；但是，今年不少企业领导人还要求大量增添人员。为了保证今年工农业生产更大、更好、更全面的跃进，根据中共安徽省委的指示，淮南市委决定充分发动群众，在全市范围内开展整顿劳动组织的运动，挖掘企业潜在力量，提高劳动效率，做到增产增事不增人，并且减少人员。
    在这个运动中，全市各工矿企业职工共写了十八万张大字报，提出二十一万条意见，揭发了浪费劳动力的现象，并且还提出许多有益的建议。九龙岗矿运输工人建议，把运输区的二十二个小组合并为十二个小组，既不影响任务，还能减少二百多人。通过群众鸣放辩论和实地试行，各企业都制订出新的比较合理的定员定额方案。如东风钢铁厂八立方公尺高炉的直接生产工人，由原来的七十二人（三班），减少到二十五点五人；十三立方公尺高炉由九十人，减少到三十人。淮南矿务局把辅助工人占55％、生产工人占45％的比例，改变为生产工人占55％、辅助工人占45％。谢家集一矿炼焦厂实行新的定员定额方案后，每人每月劳动效率达到十九点九吨，比去年平均提高165％，人员可以减少38.6％。
    各企业所采取的提高劳动效率和减少人员的具体措施，除了抓住减少辅助人员、合并机构、实行兼职作业和交叉作业以外，还大力开展了工具改革和技术改革运动。据不完全统计，已实现的改革项目有二百多件，单这方面节省的劳动力，就达一万六千多人。炼铁、炼焦企业推行技术改革，猛攻破碎、上料、运输、打夯等笨重体力劳动的难关，做到了“上料卷扬化、破碎机械化、运输车子化”。谢家集一矿炼焦厂试制成功电动筛煤机、打夯机和制砖机代替手工操作，加上空中架线运输和车子运输，劳动生产率提高两倍以上，人员减少44％。在技术改革中，各企业都本着由简到繁、由土到洋、能用土办法的用土办法、能用洋办法的用洋办法的原则，并且力求自力更生，解决设备、技术和原材料的问题。
    截至2月底止，全市调出近四万人：补充本市新建扩建企业两千多人，支援附近地区农业生产两万二千人，参加淮河改道工程一万五千人。还有两万多人，将在3、4月间陆续调出。
    经过整顿劳动组织，群众积极性十分高涨。目前，各企业职工纷纷提出各种挑战、应战及跃进保证条件。一个以技术革命为中心的社会主义竞赛运动，正在蓬勃开展。
