    The Japanese People's Struggle for Peace and Neutrality
    Lan Hai
    Recently, the Japanese people from all walks of life have demonstrated a nationwide unity and a resolute will to take the path of peace and neutrality through a series of activities. Today, a national movement against the revision and for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is unfolding across Japan with the force of a surging spring tide.

    The Advancing Japanese Peace Movement
    On February 27th and 28th of this year, the "Peace Congress for the Abolition of the Security Treaty and Promotion of Peaceful Coexistence," jointly organized by more than thirty Japanese groups, was held in Tokyo. The congress also decided to launch a "Month of Action to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" among the Japanese people starting March 15th. The congress resolved and called on people from all walks of life in Japan to prepare for a larger struggle at the end of March, including worker strikes, to create a climax during the "Month of Action."

    Five hundred and fifty peace fighters from forty-one prefectures of Japan participated in this congress. Before their departure, they held various gatherings in their respective regions to discuss the direction of the peace movement and raise funds for activities.

    All participants in the congress clearly pointed out that the struggle centered on opposing the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last year had strengthened their confidence in the victory of the peace movement. At the same time, everyone emphasized the policy of "changing the past passive stance and moving to an active offensive."

    All speeches also conveyed the idea that only the workers' class's powerful struggle is the pillar of the peace movement, and the people of the whole country should support the workers' class's struggle. The strike action held by the workers' class on November 5th last year made a valuable contribution to the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law," and left a lofty impression in the minds of the people.

    Since last year, the proportion of the workers' class in the Japanese peace movement has grown unprecedentedly. This peace congress was jointly prepared by the Japan Peace Committee and "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan). The main reports of the congress were also made by Kenjiro Yanagida, Standing Director of the Japan Peace Committee, and Akira Imamura, Vice Chairman of "Sohyo." In his report, Imamura Akira emphasized that the workers' class must carry out the peace movement with its own independent activities, and should establish a joint struggle organization including all political parties and groups that can be united.

    The establishment of peace organizations by workers in various places is a landmark event in the development of the Japanese peace movement. For example, in Omuta City, Fukuoka Prefecture, where employees and their families account for more than half of the population, workers in the Mitsui system's coal mines, dye factories, and other enterprises have established peace organizations. In addition, coal miners throughout Kyushu, at the initiative of the peace committees of the Mitsui Coal Mine and Miike Coal Mine, convened a conference of peace workers. Peace fighters from coal mines throughout Kyushu exchanged their work experiences with each other. Facts have proved that the more consciously the working masses participate in the peace movement, the more important it is to raise their political awareness and better promote the current political struggle. A peace worker in Omuta City said in discussing his work experience: "It is not difficult to publicize the principles of abolishing the 'Security Treaty' to the workers. When we explained Khrushchev's report at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, although it lasted for two hours, the workers and their families listened very attentively. In the face of the great socialist development of the Soviet Union and China, the Japanese-American military cooperation system is not only meaningless, but also very harmful to Japan. The working class understands this principle most clearly."

    On March 1, the National Conference Against Nuclear Testing and Nuclear Arming of Japan was held in Yaizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture. This day marked the fifth anniversary of the injury to the crew members of the Yaizu City's "Fifth Fukuryu Maru" fishing boat by the U.S. hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The conference passed a declaration calling for the immediate signing of a nuclear test ban treaty and the cessation of the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The declaration called for a large-scale national movement to be launched against the Kishida Nobusuke government, the Diet, and local assemblies to prevent Japan from implementing nuclear armaments and revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The activities surrounding the commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the Bikini Atoll incident are also an important part of the recent movement by the Japanese people to break the Japan-U.S. military alliance system and demand peace and neutrality.

    The Great March Against War and Unemployment
    Since the beginning of this year, a major activity has emerged in the Japanese people's struggle. This is the "National Great March Against War and Unemployment." This march was launched by the executive committee of the "Great March Against War and Unemployment," which was established in Tokyo on December 15 last year by more than 40 Japanese trade unions, democratic parties, and groups. The marching teams set off from the north and south routes. The south route started from Fukuoka on January 6, traveled 1,400 kilometers, and took 58 days; the north route started from Fukushima on February 4, took 29 days, and traveled 540 kilometers. When the marching teams passed through cities and villages along the way, they were warmly welcomed by farmers, citizens, small and medium-sized business owners, and people from other walks of life. Where the marching teams arrived, some held mass rallies, and some automatically joined the march. When the south route team passed through Yokosuka City, which has a U.S. naval base, more than 1,500 workers and citizens held a rally to warmly welcome them. Moreover, a group of unemployed workers enthusiastically joined the march. Many local mass rallies entrusted the marching teams to bring resolutions to Tokyo and hand them over to the Kishida Nobusuke government. Local masses greeted and sent off the marching teams at the borders of cities and prefectures. Two hundred and fifty representatives of the Japan Steel Pipe Company Tsurumi Ironworks Union and five hundred representatives of workers and citizens from Kanagawa Prefecture accompanied the south route team all the way to Rokugobashi, known as the south gate of Tokyo. More than one million people participated in the march in the places where the march passed, truly setting off a wave against war and unemployment.

    On March 4, the north and south routes of the Great March successfully converged in Tokyo. At this time, it was the second unified action day of the spring struggle held by various unions belonging to "Sohyo," led by the Federation of Steel Industry Unions. The atmosphere of battle was therefore even stronger. On this day, Tokyo held the "Central General Mobilization Conference of the National Great March Against War and Unemployment." The declaration passed by the conference called on the Japanese people to more actively carry out the struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," withdraw U.S. military bases in Japan, and withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Japan.

    The slogans put forward by the Japanese people in this Great March included: demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, opposing Nobusuke Kishida's re-submission of the "Police Duties Law Amendment Bill," immediately increasing workers' wages and implementing a minimum wage system, opposing unreasonable layoffs, and opposing the Kishida Nobusuke government's illegal suppression and punishment. At the summary meeting held on March 7, the participants in the march unanimously believed that this march produced an action-oriented awareness and confidence in directly combining "opposition to unemployment" with "opposition to war." An unemployed worker from Kyushu who participated in the march said: "When we saw the old women in the countryside put their palms together to pay tribute to the portraits of atomic bomb victims hanging on our chests, I realized the true meaning of this Great March." Shioya Nobuo, a standing director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, emphasized when evaluating this Great March that it has epoch-making significance in the history of the Japanese people's movement. The participants in the march threw themselves into the activities of the "Month of Action to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" with higher fighting spirit.

    Enhanced Unity of Democratic Forces
    Recently, one of the most important characteristics of the Japanese people's struggle is the new development of the unity of democratic forces. After the victory in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" at the end of last year, the Japanese people turned the focus of their struggle to the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." On February 9, twenty people's groups and democratic parties in Tokyo formed the "Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for Maintaining Peace and Democracy." On February 28, this organization and five people's groups centered on "Sohyo" jointly launched the "National Congress to Smash the Security Treaty System and Restore Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations," with nearly two hundred participating mass groups. This was the first large-scale national joint action since the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last year.

    Moreover, during the "National Great March Against War and Unemployment," the unity of democratic forces in various parts of Japan was continuously strengthened. Various regular joint struggle organizations sprung up like mushrooms after rain. For example, "Joint Struggle Conferences for Maintaining Peace and Democracy" were established in Fukushima and Hiroshima; "Social Security Promotion Councils" were established in Okayama and Hyogo; "Prefectural People's Conferences Against Unemployment and Establishing Social Security" were established in Ishikawa; "Democratic Defense Alliances" were formed in Gunma; Under the joint proposal of the local organizations of the Japan Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the "Joint Struggle Organization to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" was established in Shimane Prefecture, and so on.

    A major sign of the new development of the unity of democratic forces in Japan is that the Japan Socialist Party decided to take joint action with the Communist Party on March 10. This is the first time in recent years that the Japan Socialist Party has decided to take joint action with the Communist Party, and therefore it is of great significance for enhancing the unity of democratic forces in Japan.

    The nationwide joint struggle organization "National Conference to Prevent Revision and Strive for Abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" (tentative name), initiated by nine groups including the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, "Sohyo," and the Japan Peace Committee, will be established on March 28. This organization plans to take unified national action in mid-April to mobilize the broad masses to fight to smash the conspiracy of Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty."

    There is no doubt that the Japanese people, who have accumulated experience in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law," will give the Kishida Nobusuke group, which is following the reactionary activities of the U.S. war policy, a double blow in today's great development of national unity.

### 日本人民争取和平中立的斗争

    日本人民争取和平中立的斗争
    蓝海
    最近一个时期以来，日本各界人民通过一系列的活动，鲜明地显示了全民性的团结和坚决走和平中立道路的意志。今天，一个反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的国民运动，正以春潮汹涌之势，在日本全国各地展开。
    前进中的日本和平运动
    今年2月27、28两日，日本三十多个团体联合组织的“废除安全条约、促进和平共处和平大会”于东京开会。大会并且决定从3月15日起在日本人民当中展开一个“阻止修改安全条约行动月”。大会决议并号召日本各界人民准备在3月底掀起包括工人罢工在内的更大斗争，以在“行动月”中形成高潮。
    参加这次大会的有来自全国四十一个都、道、府、县的五百五十名和平战士。他们临出发前，在各地举行了各种集会，讨论了和平运动的方针，并且募集了活动资金。
    所有参加大会的人都明确地指出，经过去年一年以反对修改“警职法”为中心而开展的斗争，加强了和平运动的胜利信心。同时，大家都强调“改变以往的被动立场，转入积极攻势”的方针。
    所有的发言当中还贯穿着这样一种思想：只有工人阶级的实力斗争是和平运动的支柱，全国人民都应该支持工人阶级的斗争。去年11月5日工人阶级举行的罢工行动，对反对修改“警职法”斗争就作出了宝贵贡献，在人民心目中留下了崇高的印象。
    自从去年以来，工人阶级在日本和平运动中所占的比重空前地增长了。这次的和平大会，就是日本和平委员会和“总评”共同筹备的。大会的主要报告也是由日本和平委员会常任理事柳田谦十郎和“总评”副议长今村彰两个人作的。今村彰在报告中强调指出，工人阶级必须以独自的活动来开展和平运动，而且应该建立包括一切能够联合的政党团体在内的联合斗争组织。
    各地工人纷纷建立了和平组织，这是日本和平运动发展中具有划时代意义的事情。例如，在职工及其家属占人口半数以上的福冈县大牟田市，三井系统的煤矿、染料厂及其它各企业的工人，都成立了和平组织。又如，全九州的煤矿工人在三井煤矿、三池煤矿的和平委员会倡议下，曾召开了和平工作者会议。来自九州各地煤矿的和平战士，彼此交流了工作经验。事实证明，工人群众越发自觉地参加和平运动，对于提高他们的政治觉悟，更好地推动当前的政治斗争起着重要的作用。大牟田市的一位和平工作者在谈到工作体会时说：“向工人们宣传废除‘安全条约’的道理，并不困难。当我们讲解赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上所作的报告时，虽然讲了两个来钟头，但是工人及其家属们都听得很入神。在苏联和中国社会主义大发展的面前，日美的军事合作体制不仅毫无意义，而且对日本说来又是多么有害的事情。这样的道理，工人阶级认识得最清楚”。
    3月1日在静冈县烧津市举行了反对核试验和核武装日本的全国大会。这一天是烧津市
  “福龙丸第五号”渔船船员在太平洋比基尼岛受美国试验氢弹伤害的五周年。这次大会通过了关于要求立即签订禁止核试验协定和制止修改日美“安全条约”的宣言。宣言号召，为了阻止日本实行核武装和修改日美“安全条约”，必须对岸信介政府、国会和地方议会展开一个大规模的国民运动。围绕纪念比基尼岛事件五周年而展开的活动，也是最近日本人民打破日美军事同盟体制、要求和平中立运动的一个重要组成部分。
    反对战争和失业的大进军
    从今年年初以来，日本人民斗争中出现了一个重大的活动。这就是“反对战争和失业国民大游行”。这次大游行是由日本的四十多个工会、民主政党和团体在去年12月15日在东京成立的“反对战争和失业大游行”实行委员会发动的。大游行的队伍分南北两路出发。南路于1月6日从福冈出发，跋涉一千四百公里，历时五十八天；北路于2月4日从福岛出发，历时二十九天，走了五百四十公里的途程。游行的终点是东京。南北两路游行队伍，经过沿路的城市和乡村时，受到广大农民、市民、中小企业者及其它各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。游行队伍所到之处，有的召开群众大会，有的自动参加游行。南路队伍经过有美国海军基地的横须贺市时，一千五百多名工人、市民举行大会热烈欢迎他们。而且有一批失业工人踊跃参加了游行。许多地方的群众大会委托游行队伍把决议书带到东京去交给岸信介政府。各地群众都在市、县的边境迎送游行队伍。日本钢管公司鹤见制铁所工会的二百五十名代表，以及神奈川县的五百名工人、市民代表，曾经陪同南路队伍一直走到号称东京南大门的六乡桥。这次大游行经过的地方，先后共有一百多万人参加游行，真正掀起了一个反对战争和失业的热潮。
    3月4日大游行的南北两路队伍，在东京胜利地会师。这时正是以钢铁工业工会联合会为首的“总评”所属各工会举行春季斗争的第二次统一行动日。战斗的气氛因而更加强烈。这一天东京举行了“反对战争和失业国民大游行中央总奋起大会”。大会通过的宣言中，号召日本人民更加积极地进行斗争争取废除日美“安全条约”，撤销美国在日本的军事基地，撤走驻在日本的美国军队。
    日本人民在这次大游行中提出的口号有：要求废除日美“安全条约”、要求恢复日中邦交、反对岸信介再次提出“警职法修正案”、立即提高工人工资和实施最低工资制度、反对不合理裁减人员以及反对岸信介政府的非法镇压和处分。在3月7日举行的总结大会上，参加游行的人一致认为通过这次游行产生了把
  “反对失业”同“反对战争”直接结合起来的行动觉悟和信心。参加游行的一位九州的失业工人说：“当我们看到农村老大娘合掌向我们胸前挂着的原子弹受害者遗像致敬时，我体会到了这次大游行的真实意义。”日本工会总评议会常任干事盐谷信雄在评价这次大游行时强调说，这在日本人民运动史上具有划时代的重要意义。参加游行的人以更加高昂的斗志，投入了“阻止修改安全条约行动月”的活动。
    民主力量团结的增强
    最近，日本人民斗争的一个最重要的特征，是民主力量的团结有了新的发展。日本人民在去年年底继反对修改“警职法”斗争胜利后，把斗争的锋芒指向了日美修改“安全条约”的阴谋。2月9日，东京的二十个人民团体和民主政党的组织，组成了“东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议”。2月28日，这个组织和以“总评”为中心的五个人民团体联合发起了“粉碎安全条约体系、恢复日中邦交国民大会”，参加的群众团体近二百个。这是自从去年反对修改“警职法”斗争以来第一次全国性巨大的联合行动。
    再有，在“反对战争和失业国民大游行”期间，日本各地民主力量的团结不断加强。各种经常性的联合斗争的组织，如雨后春笋般建立起来。比如，福岛和广岛等地成立了“维护和平与民主共同斗争会议”；冈山、兵库成立了“促进社会保障协议会”；石川成立了“反对失业、确立社会保障县民会议”；群马组成了“拥护民主联盟”；岛根县在日本社会党、共产党的地方组织共同提议下，成立了“阻止修改安全条约共同斗争组织”，等等。
    而日本民主力量团结新发展的重大标志，是3月10日日本社会党决定同共产党采取联合行动。这是最近几年来，日本社会党第一次决定和共产党采取联合行动，因而对于增强日本民主力量的团结具有十分重大的意义。
    由日本社会党、共产党、“总评”及日本和平委员会等九个团体发起的“阻止修改和争取废除日美安全条约国民会议”（暂称）的全国性联合斗争组织，即将于3月28日成立。这个组织计划于4月中旬采取全国性统一行动，为动员广大群众粉碎日美修改“安全条约”的阴谋而斗争。
    毫无疑义，在反对修改“警职法”斗争中积累了经验的日本人民，在全民团结大发展的今天，将会给岸信介集团追随美国战争政策的反动活动以加倍的打击。（附图片）
