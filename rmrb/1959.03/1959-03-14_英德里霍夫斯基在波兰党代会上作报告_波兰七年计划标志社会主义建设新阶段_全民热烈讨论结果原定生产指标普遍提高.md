Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 12th - The third congress of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) held its afternoon session on the 12th, hearing a report by PUWP Central Political Bureau member, Indrichovsky, "On the Directives for Developing the National Economy in 1959-1965."

　　The reporter pointed out that the next seven years would be a further, higher stage of Poland's socialist industrialization, with profound structural changes taking place throughout the national economy. He said that the realization of the 1959-1965 development directives for Poland would be a new and major step forward for Poland on the road to socialist construction. It would also be Poland's contribution to the overall cause of the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism.

　　Indrichovsky said that before the opening of this congress, factories, enterprises, Party organizations, and government bodies throughout Poland had enthusiastically discussed the 1959-1965 development plan. After the discussions, the production growth targets were raised compared to the directives adopted by the 12th Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. Many units also put forward production increase guarantees.

　　The reporter pointed out that the new stage of socialist industrialization requires concentrating greater effort and more funds to develop those industrial sectors that are decisive for the development of the entire national economy. He said that the total investment in production during the seven years would reach 514 billion zlotys, an increase of 22 billion zlotys over the investment proposed by the 12th Plenary Session.

　　He said that industrial production from 1961 to 1965 would increase by approximately 50%, with the production of means of production increasing by 51.4% and the production of consumer goods increasing by 48.6%. Investment from 1961 to 1965 will increase by 49%, which is a 56.9% increase compared to the current Five-Year Plan.

　　When talking about industrial construction investment, the reporter pointed out that industrial investment is mainly used to develop the production of means of production, accounting for approximately 80% of total industrial investment. Poland will focus on developing the fuel base, machinery, and chemical industries.

　　Indrichovsky talked about the development of various national economic sectors. He pointed out that there would be huge changes in the fuel structure, namely that coal mining would be relatively slow. By 1965, coal production would increase to 112 million to 113 million tons. By 1965, the consumption of petroleum products would increase by 220% compared to 1958; natural gas production would reach one billion cubic meters; and lignite production would increase from 7.5 million tons in 1958 to 27 million tons in 1965. Lignite will be used for power generation in the future. By 1965, electricity production will increase to 43.5 billion to 45 billion kilowatt-hours.

　　The reporter pointed out that the new plan stipulates that production should be developed in a balanced way, the proportion of new products should be expanded, and the production process should be improved.

　　Indrichovsky pointed out that fully utilizing existing equipment and increasing new production capacity are the main problems for the metallurgical industry. By 1965, steel production will reach 9 million tons. In addition, efforts should be made to develop non-ferrous metal industries such as lead and zinc. The production targets for non-ferrous metals have been increased compared to the original plan after discussion.

　　Indrichovsky said that by 1965, the production of the chemical industry would increase by 107% compared to 1960, and by 160% compared to 1958. The production of synthetic fibers will increase five and a half times from 1961 to 1965. The output of the machinery manufacturing industry and the electrical equipment industry will increase by 73% by 1965 compared to 1960.

　　When talking about the development of the consumer goods industry, the reporter pointed out that in the light industry, the production of wool fabrics will increase by one million meters more than stipulated in the directives of the 12th Plenary Session by 1965, knitted goods will increase by four million pieces, and cotton fabrics will increase by 6.36 million meters. The total output value of the food industry and enterprises affiliated to the procurement department will increase by 31% by 1965 compared to 1960.

　　The reporter also talked about the prospects for the further development and modernization of the transportation industry.

　　The reporter said that in the new plan, special attention will be paid to the correct allocation of productive forces and the reduction of the imbalance in the distribution of productive forces. Some factories will be moved to the western region. In addition, vigorous efforts will be made to develop backward areas and utilize existing production resources and potential.

　　The reporter pointed out that during the period from 1961 to 1965, two million housing units would be built in cities and 1.2 million housing units would be built in rural areas. When talking about foreign trade, he said that the volume of foreign trade in 1965 would increase by 46.3% compared to now. The basic direction of developing foreign trade is to strengthen economic relations with socialist countries. Currently, they account for 60% of Poland's foreign trade.

　　In the total export value, the proportion of machinery, industrial equipment, and transportation vehicles will increase from 27.8% in 1958 to 39% in 1965, that is to say, it will approach the level of industrialized countries.

　　He said that the seven-year development plan stipulates that the real income of the people will increase by 33% to 35% in seven years.

　　In the end of his report, Indrichovsky expressed his belief that the Polish working people would support the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party with practical actions, and strive to realize the seven-year development directives and create a better future for People's Poland.

　　The afternoon session on the 12th ended here. (Attached photo)

    英德里霍夫斯基在波兰党代会上作报告
    波兰七年计划标志社会主义建设新阶段
    全民热烈讨论结果原定生产指标普遍提高
    新华社华沙12日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会12日下午会议，听取了统一工人党中央政治局委员英德里霍夫斯基的“关于1959——1965年发展国民经济指示”的报告。
    报告人指出，今后七年是波兰社会主义工业化进一步发展的、更高的阶段，整个国民经济将发生深刻的结构变化。他说，1959—1965年波兰发展指示的实现，将是波兰在社会主义建设的道路上向前迈出新的一大步。这也将是波兰对社会主义同资本主义进行和平竞赛的总的事业的一个贡献。
    英德里霍夫斯基说，在这次代表大会开幕前，波兰各工厂、企业、党组织、机关都热烈讨论了1959—1965年发展计划。经过讨论后，生产增长的指标比党的十二中全会通过的指示提高了。许多单位还提出了增产保证。
    报告人指出，社会主义工业化的新阶段要求集中更大的努力和更多的资金来发展那些对发展整个国民经济有决定意义的工业部门。他说，七年中生产投资总额将达五千一百四十亿兹罗提，这比十二中全会提出的投资增加二百二十亿兹罗提。
    他说，1961—1965年工业生产约将增加50％，其中生产资料的生产将增加51.4％，消费品的生产增加48.6％。1961—1965年投资将增加49％，即比现在的五年计划增加56.9％。
    报告人在谈到工业建设的投资时指出，工业投资主要用于发展生产资料的生产，约占全部工业投资的80％。波兰将着重发展燃料基地、机器和化学工业。
    英德里霍夫斯基谈到了各国民经济部门发展的情况。他指出，在燃料结构方面将发生巨大变化，这就是煤的开采要比较慢。到1965年，采煤量将提高到一亿一千二百万到一亿一千三百万吨。到1965年，石油产品的消费将比1958年增加220％；天然瓦斯的开采将达到十亿立方公尺；褐煤的开采将从1958年的七百五十万吨增加到1965年的二千七百万吨。今后将利用褐煤发电。到1965年，电力生产将增加到四百三十五亿到四百五十亿度。
    报告人指出，新的计划中规定要平衡地发展生产、扩大新产品比例、改进生产过程。
    英德里霍夫斯基指出，充分利用现有设备和增加新的生产能力是冶金工业的主要问题。到1965年钢产量将达到九百万吨。此外，还要大力发展铅锌等有色金属工业。有色金属的产量指标经过讨论后都比原计划增加。
    英德里霍夫斯基说，到1965年化学工业的生产将比1960年增加107％，比1958年增加160％。合成纤维的生产在1961—1965年内将增加五倍半。机器制造工业和电工器材工业的产量到1965年将比1960年增加73％。
    报告人在谈到消费品工业的发展情况时指出，在轻工业中，毛织品的生产到1965年将比十二中全会指示中规定的增加一百万公尺，针织品增加四百万件，棉织品增加六百三十六万公尺。食品工业和采购部所属的企业的总产值到1965年将比1960年增加31％。
    报告人还谈到了运输业的进一步发展和现代化的前景。
    报告人说，在新的计划中，将特别注意正确配置生产力和减轻生产力分布不平衡的现象。将有一些工厂迁到西部地区去。此外，还将积极发展落后地区和利用现有的生产资源和潜力。
    报告人指出，在1961—1965年期间，将在城市中建造二百万间住房，在农村中建造一百二十万间住房。他在谈到对外贸易时说，1965年对外贸易额将比现在增加46.3％。发展对外贸易的基本方向是加强同社会主义国家的经济关系。目前它们在波兰对外贸易额中所占的比重是60％。
    在出口总值中，机器、工业设备和交通工具所占的比重将从1958年的27.8％增长到1965年的39％，也就是说将接近工业发达的国家的水平。
    他说，七年发展计划规定，人民的实际收入在七年内将增加33％到35％。
    英德里霍夫斯基在报告的最后表示，相信波兰劳动人民会用实际行动，来支持波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的决议，为实现七年发展指示、为创造人民波兰美好的未来而奋斗。
