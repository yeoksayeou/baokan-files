Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 8th: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a national conference of refractory material factories and mines in Jiaozuo City, Henan Province. The conference called on all factories and mines to continue to implement the "walking on two legs" policy, vigorously promote mass movements, and launch a technical revolution to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in high production, high quality, and diverse varieties of refractory materials, and to strive to ensure the successful completion of the 18 million tons of steel production target this year.

This conference summarized and exchanged production experiences from 1958, formulated plans for factory and mine production, capital construction, and product allocation in 1959, and studied and formulated measures.

The conference pointed out that in 1958, under the impetus of the all-round leap forward with steel as the key link, China's refractory material industry resolutely implemented the Party's General Line and policies, thus achieving great achievements. Last year, the number of refractory material production units nationwide increased from more than eighty in 1957 to more than one thousand, and output increased by more than two times compared with 1957, guaranteeing the need for doubling steel production. The conference believes that although China's refractory material production capacity has grown significantly in 1958, it is still far from meeting the needs of the high-speed development of steel and other industries this year. The conference required that the production of refractory bricks this year have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, in order to meet the requirements of high yield, long life, and good iron and good steel for metallurgical equipment, of which silica bricks, magnesia bricks (including magnesia-alumina bricks), and high-alumina bricks must have significant increases.

Faced with the situation of large refractory material production tasks and urgent needs in various aspects, the conference decided: this year, we must continue to vigorously implement the "walking on two legs" policy. On the one hand, we must fully tap the potential of large and medium-sized modern factories, improve the production efficiency of crushing and forming, achieve "large-area harvest," and accelerate the construction and expansion of large and medium-sized factories, and do everything possible to strive for early commissioning; on the other hand, we must vigorously develop simple refractory material factories. Preliminary planning calls for the promotion of 600 sets of simple refractory material equipment this year, with each set having an annual output of 5,000 tons. At the same time, we must consolidate and improve the small indigenous refractory material factories, universally implement fixed type, fixed team, fixed labor force, fixed raw material base, and supply relationship, and comprehensively carry out technical reforms to achieve the goals of increasing output, expanding variety, improving quality, and improving labor conditions. For those key "small indigenous group" factories with better resources and transportation conditions, we must vigorously develop indigenous and foreign-combined mechanical equipment, gradually realize simple mechanization, and develop into indigenous and foreign-combined medium and small-sized refractory material factories.

The conference emphasized that the demand and quality of refractory materials are closely related. If we simply pursue quantity and ignore quality, it will increase the demand even more, create a vicious cycle, and expand the contradiction of supply. Therefore, the conference required all localities to deeply mobilize the masses and vigorously tackle the quality of products to ensure that the quality of refractory materials reaches "three resistances, three smalls, and two goods," that is, resistance to fire, resistance to erosion, and resistance to pressure; small porosity, small reheat shrinkage, and small tolerance; good appearance, and good cross-section. Regarding the product quality of modern large and medium-sized factories, the conference required to ensure the standards stipulated by the state, improve the yield rate and the first-class product rate, and continuously improve the main physical and chemical indicators of important products; regarding the product quality of small indigenous factories, the conference required to gradually improve to near the standards stipulated by the state.

The conference required all localities to vigorously develop the raw material production of the refractory material industry, strengthen the management of existing production bases and the construction of new bases, so that various raw materials required for production can be supplied in a timely manner with the right quality and quantity. For this reason, a unified plan should be made for refractory material production and raw material mines. Large and medium-sized refractory material factories should have their own raw material mines and a fixed and reliable raw material supply base, and strive to supply nearby and reduce long-distance transportation. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions with a foundation in raw material production must mobilize mine workers to carry out technical innovation, improve production efficiency, and actively support key enterprises and regions with weak refractory raw material production; these regions must also actively find resources and seize the construction of raw material mines.

The conference emphasized that all refractory material factories and mining enterprises must implement the national unified plan, actively support key needs, and ensure the completion of the allocation tasks of refractory materials with the right quality and quantity.

Before the end of the conference, representatives from Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, and other provinces and Anshan Iron and Steel Refractory Material Factory put forward specific arrangements and opinions on the measures to increase production in old factories, the division of responsibility for helping new factories, and the planning for the development of simple refractory material factories.

Through this conference, representatives of the metallurgical departments and key enterprises of various provinces, cities (autonomous regions) clarified the importance of refractory materials serving the steel industry, and unanimously stated that they would immediately organize the masses to launch a new production upsurge on the refractory material industry front. All the representatives attending the conference also issued a proposal to workers engaged in refractory material production across the country. (Attached picture)

    保证钢铁熔炉高产长寿
    耐火材料会议确定大力增加产量提高质量扩大品种
    据新华社郑州8日电　冶金工业部最近在河南焦作市召开全国耐火材料厂矿会议，号召各厂矿继续贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，实现耐火材料高产、优质、多品种的全面大跃进，为保证胜利完成今年一千八百万吨钢的生产任务而奋斗。
    这次会议总结和交流了1958年的生产经验，制定了1959年厂矿生产、基本建设和产品调拨等方面的规划，并且研究制订了措施。
    会议指出，1958年我国耐火材料工业在以钢为纲全面跃进的带动下，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和方针政策，因而取得了很大的成绩。去年全国耐火材料生产单位由1957年的八十多个，发展到一千多个，产量比1957年增加了两倍多，保证了钢产量翻一番的需要。会议认为，1958年我国耐火材料生产能力虽然有了巨大的增长，但是同今年钢铁和其他工业高速度发展的需要比较，还是相差很远。会议要求今年耐火砖的生产要有更大更好更全面的跃进，为满足冶金设备高产、长寿和出好铁好钢的要求，其中矽砖、镁砖（包括镁铝砖）、高铝砖都要有很大的增长。
    面临着耐火材料工业生产任务大、各方面需要紧迫的情况，会议决定：今年必须继续大力贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，一方面充分挖掘大中型现代化工厂的潜力，提高粉碎和成型的生产效率，实现“大面积丰收”，并且加速大中型厂的新建和扩建，千方百计争取早日投入生产；另一方面，要大搞简易耐火材料厂。初步规划，今年要推广六百套简易耐火材料设备，每套年产量可达五千吨。同时，巩固提高耐火材料工业的小土厂，普遍实行定型、定组、定劳动力、定原料基地和供应关系，全面地开展技术改革，以达到增加产量、扩大品种、提高质量、改善劳动条件的目的；对于那些资源、交通等条件较好的重点“小土群”工厂，要大搞土洋结合的机械设备，逐步实现简易机械化，发展成为土洋结合的中、小型耐火材料厂。
    会议强调指出，耐火材料需用量和质量有着密切的关系，如果单纯地追求数量忽视质量，就会使需要量增加更大，造成恶性循环，扩大供应的矛盾。因此，会议要求各地深入发动群众，猛攻产品质量关，保证耐火材料质量达到“三耐、三小、两好”，即耐火、耐浸蚀、耐压；气孔率小、重烧收缩小、公差小；外形好，断面好。关于现代化大中型厂的产品质量，会议要求保证国家规定的标准，提高成品率和一级品率，并且要不断提高重要产品的主要理化指标；关于小土厂的产品质量，会议要求逐步提高到接近国家规定的标准。
    会议要求各地大力发展耐火材料工业的原料生产，加强原有生产基地的管理和新基地的建设，使生产所需的各种原料按质按量得到及时供应。为此，对耐火材料生产和原料矿山要作统一的规划。各大中型耐火材料厂要有自己的原料矿山和固定可靠的原料供应基地，尽量作到就近供应，减少长途运输。在原料生产有基础的省、市、自治区，必须发动矿山职工开展技术革新，提高生产效率，积极支援重点企业和耐火原材料生产较薄弱的地区；这些地区也要积极寻找资源，抓紧原料矿山的建设。
    会议强调指出，各个耐火材料厂矿企业必须贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，积极支援重点的需要，保证按质按量完成耐火材料的调拨任务。
    会议结束前，河南、陕西、安徽等省和鞍钢耐火材料厂的代表们，对于老厂的增产措施、帮助新厂的分片包干规划、发展简易耐火材料厂的规划等，都提出了具体的安排意见。
    各省、市（自治区）的冶金部门和重点企业的代表通过这次会议，明确了耐火材料为钢铁工业服务的重要性，一致表示要立即组织群众在耐火材料工业战线上掀起一个新的生产高潮。出席会议的全体代表并向全国从事耐火材料生产的职工发出了倡议书。（附图片）
