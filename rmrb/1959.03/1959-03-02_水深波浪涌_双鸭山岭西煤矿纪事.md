Deep Water, Surging Waves
-- A Chronicle of the Lingxi Coal Mine in Shuangyashan
By our reporter Ye Jianyun

	Unprecedented, but Never to be the Last
	In 1958, the Lingxi Mine revised its Great Leap Forward plan eight times. Each time it was revised, people exclaimed that it was an unprecedented and unsurpassed target. But as it turned out, each one was more advanced than the last.
	Lingxi is an old mine with thin coal seams. After years of mining, the mine was already in a stage of gradual decline. That is to say, the thick, good coal seams were being mined out quickly. First, they ate meat, then they gnawed on bones, and they were currently in the bone-gnawing period. At the beginning of last year, they set a target of producing 670,000 tons of coking coal annually. This was more than any year in history, and it could not be considered unprecedented and unsurpassed.
	Soon, the battle drum of the Great Leap Forward sounded across the country, and the leaders here were worried that their plan was too conservative. After some checking and calculation, they raised the target to 740,000 tons, and later to 880,000 tons. In September, when the great task of the Party's 10.7 million tons of steel reached Lingxi, they raised the target to 990,000 tons. At this time, some people said that this figure was a paper flower in a pot, and should not be appreciated as a real flower.
	Once the target was set, the Lingxi Party Committee used the method of organizing high-yield days to promote the increase of daily output. As a result, the output on high-yield days rose, but the daily output declined. As a result, the gossip of the skeptics increased.
	Why did the output on high-yield days rise while the average output declined? It turned out that these planned figures were all made up in the office. The Party Committee studied the root cause and decided to hand over the task to the masses for discussion. A vigorous mass movement was launched in the mine, and the workers expressed their opinions: "Our mine has coal, but it is a bit difficult to mine. As long as everyone thinks of a way to overcome the difficulties, there is no need to worry about not being able to overproduce." At this time, the workers also wrote a poem: Difficulties are like springs, see if you are strong, if you are strong, it is weak, if it is weak, you are strong, do it one hundred and ten, the old mine becomes a new mine.
	After the masses were mobilized, the plan went from one million to one million and five thousand to one million and ten thousand tons, and the final actual completion was one million and thirteen thousand tons. This means that with drive, there is a leap forward.

	The First Day of 1959
	The Great Leap Forward of 1958 left a deep impression on people. Some people say: The drive has no bottom, the leap forward has no limit. Miracles happen every year, and one year is better than the other. But some people also say: Trees have roots, water has a source, and the leap forward must have an end. When the people of the Lingxi Mine were considering the production plan for 1959, these two ideas launched a fierce struggle.
	The struggle started with accounting. Those who said that the leap forward had an end calculated this account: In 1958, there were sixteen working faces in the entire mine. Although the conditions were poor, there were still three thick coal seams of 1.5 to 1.7 meters. This year, there is only one, and the rest are thin or extremely thin coal seams of 1 meter to 0.4 meters. A leap forward will not be so simple. Therefore, they advocated that this year, at most, only 900,000 tons could be achieved.
	Those who said that the leap forward had no limit believed that the account should be calculated like this: Thin coal seams are indeed a difficulty, but people's drive and wisdom are infinitely great. The key is how to bring it into play. The important gain of 1958 was the exploration of a set of experiences to overcome difficulties. This set of experiences can be summarized as: One hanging -- political command, two walking -- following the mass line, following the road of combining native and foreign methods, three fast -- discovering problems quickly, solving them quickly, acting quickly, four handing over -- explaining the situation, handing over tasks, handing over difficulties, handing over methods, five to -- leading cadres go to the scene, technicians go to the scene, political work goes to the scene, propaganda and mobilization go to the scene, cultural entertainment goes to the scene, six same -- eat together, live together, work together, study problems together, solve problems together, entertain together, seven compare -- compare advanced, compare drive, compare thought, compare consciousness, compare quality, compare safety, compare saving, eight grasp -- grasp thought, grasp production, grasp life, grasp planning, grasp measures, grasp preparation, grasp quality, grasp safety, nine big -- launch a big mass movement, make a big technical revolution, insert big red flags, big ming, big fang, big debate, big comparison, big competition, big inspection. This set of work experience has opened up a broad road for continuing to boost morale and carry forward the wisdom of the masses.
	Although the former did not agree with the opinions of the latter in this debate, they could not put forward any objections. They always felt that the achievements of 1958 should be considered unsurpassed.
	On this issue, the Lingxi Mine Party Committee of the Communist Party of China did a series of background investigations. The Party Committee believes that if the Lingxi Mine wants to achieve a greater and better leap forward in 1959, it must constantly boost its morale. To make the drive lasting, it must concentrate the high emotions of the masses on one goal. At present, tunneling lags behind coal mining, which is a weak link in coal production. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to launch a technical revolution in tunneling to break through this weak link. As soon as the resolution was passed to the pit mouth, the workers held a promotion meeting. At the meeting, some workers went on stage three or four times in a row, challenging their companions with higher and higher operation targets.
	On New Year's Day, the first day of 1959, the miners of the Lingxi Mine once again told people with their new achievements that there is only unprecedented and no unsurpassed.
	On this day, the planned output was 3,800 tons, exceeding the average daily output of last year by 800 tons. Three shifts worked, with an average of 1,270 tons per shift. On the same day, the workers of the first shift proposed: Look at January for the whole year, look at New Year's Day for January, and look at the first shift for New Year's Day; full attendance is a good start, a red New Year's Day, a red January, a red whole year, a red every month. As a result, this first shift produced 1,800 tons of coal, and the entire day produced 4,200 tons of coal, exceeding the original plan by 400 tons. Then, the daily footage of tunneling also leapt from 150 meters to 315.5 meters, creating the highest record in the entire mine.
	The first shot of the new year was very loud, opening the prelude to a full red January and a red every month throughout the year. When the plan for coal production of 114,500 tons in January was initially determined, some people shook their heads, thinking that this was a risky plan, but the result was 130,149 tons, exceeding the plan by 15,649 tons. In terms of tunneling, the plan was 5,127 meters, but the result was 5,991 meters, exceeding the plan by 864 meters.
	The victory in January made many people who had previously believed that the exhausted mine could not be turned over also admit that the mine's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year was completely guaranteed. They said that based on the actual results in January, the whole year should be able to complete 1.5 million tons, not 900,000 tons. As Tang poetry says: Deep water, wide waves. Isn't the mass movement in the Lingxi Mine the same!

	Whose Home Does the Red Flag Belong to Today
	January pointed out a promising future for the people of Lingxi. However, people have not forgotten that to achieve greater achievements, they must work harder. Based on this belief, this year's Spring Festival has seen an unprecedented heroic scene.
	Early on the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, the mine entrance was plastered with big-character posters, with poems, clapper rhymes, and some with only two sentences. The forms were different, but the meaning was the same, which was to attend work. It turned out that the miners had learned in advance that the leaders had arranged maintenance tasks on New Year's Day and did not want everyone to go down the mine. Everyone volunteered to participate in the work of loading and storing coal. This registration caused no small trouble. The cadres of each pit spent a lot of effort to mobilize them to go back, but no one was willing to go back. They said: "We are here to load and store coal, not to earn wages." The cadres said: "There are too many people crowded together, there are not so many tools, it is not good to waste work." But the workers said: "This is a little bit of our heart for the country and for steel. If there are no tools, we have hands!" Later, it was found that there was a group of female workers in the team, so they went to mobilize them. This mobilization made a female worker named Jiang Chunzhi angry. She questioned the branch secretary: "Is it right to do this? If you mobilize the men not to leave, you come to chase us women away. If you say we are not as good as men, then watch!" Saying that, she led a group of female workers, jumped onto the coal pile, and started carrying coal. . . . . . . .
	These days, the mine is preparing to select red flag units.
	"Whose home does the red flag belong to today?" This is the most difficult thing for party organizations at all levels. (Attached picture)

    水深波浪涌
    ——双鸭山岭西煤矿纪事

        有空前并无绝后
    1958年，岭西矿修改了八次跃进计划，每改一次，人们都要赞叹一句，这是空前绝后的指标。而结果哩，一次都比一次先进。
    岭西是一个薄煤层的老矿井，经过多年的开采，矿井已经处于逐年递减的阶段。这就是说，厚的好的煤层采的快完了，先采吃肉，后采啃骨头，他们正处在啃骨头的时期。去年年初，他们却订了一个年产焦煤六十七万吨的指标。大于历史上任何一年，这不能不算是空前绝后了。
    不久，全国响起了大跃进的战鼓，这里的领导干部不放心自己的计划是否保守，经过一番查算，又把指标提高到七十四万吨，后来，又提到了八十八万吨。9月，党的一千零七十万吨钢的伟大任务传到岭西，他们又把指标提到了九十九万吨。这时，有人说，这个数字是纸上盆花，不能当真花来欣赏。
    指标一确定，岭西党委就用组织高产日的办法，来促进日产量的提高。结果，高产日的产量上升了，而日常的产量却在下降，于是，怀疑派的怪话又多起来了。
    为什么高产日的产量能够上升而平均产量却在下降呢？原来，这些计划数字都是在办公室里订出来的，党委研究这个根由，就决定把任务交给群众去讨论。矿上掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，工人们发表意见说：“咱们矿有煤，不过挖起来有些困难，只要大家想办法，攻下了难关，不愁不能超产。”这时工人们还写了一首诗歌：困难像弹簧，看你强不强，你强它就弱，它弱你就强，干它个一百一，老井变新矿。
    群众发动起来以后，计划又由一百万到一百零五万再到一百一十万吨，最后的实迹却完成了一百一十三万吨。这就是有了干劲，就有了跃进。
        1959年的第一天
    1958年的大跃进，给人们留下了深刻的印象。有人说：干劲无底，跃进无边。奇迹年年有，一年更比一年多。可是也有人说：树有根，水有源，跃进总得有个头。当岭西矿的人们在考虑1959年的生产计划时，这两种思想就展开了激烈的斗争。
    斗争是从算账开始的，说跃进有头的人算的是这一笔账：1958年全矿十六个工作面，虽说条件差，一点五至一点七公尺的厚煤层还有三个，今年只有一个，其余都是一公尺至零点四公尺的薄或极薄的煤层，要跃进，就不那么简单了。因此，他们主张今年最多只能搞九十万吨。
    说跃进无边的人认为账应该这样算：煤层薄，确是一个困难，然而，人的干劲和智慧却是无限大，关键在于如何把它发挥出来。1958年的重要收获就是摸索出一套克服困难的经验，这套经验归纳起来，就是：一挂——政治挂帅，二走——走群众路线、走土洋并举的道路，三快——发现问题快、解决得快、行动得快，四交——交代形势、交任务、交困难、交办法，五到——领导干部到现场，技术人员到现场、政治工作到现场、宣传鼓动到现场、文化娱乐到现场，六同——同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究问题、同解决问题、同娱乐，七比——比先进、比干劲、比思想、比觉悟、比质量、比安全、比节约，八抓——抓思想、抓生产、抓生活、抓计划、抓措施、抓准备、抓质量、抓安全，九大——大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命、大插红旗、大鸣、大放、大辩论、大比、大赛、大检查。这一套工作经验，为继续鼓足干劲、发扬群众智慧开辟了一条广阔的道路。
    这场辩论，虽然前一种人并不同意后一种人的意见，可是他们也提不出什么反对的意见，总觉得1958年的成就应该算是绝后的。
    在这个问题上，中共岭西矿党委会做了一系列的摸底工作。党委认为：1959年岭西矿要更大更好的跃进，就必须经常鼓足干劲，要干劲持久，必须把群众的高涨情绪集中到一个目标上去。当前，掘进落后于采煤，是煤炭生产中的薄弱环节。于是，党委决定在掘进工作上开展技术革命突破这个薄弱环节。决议一传到井口，工人们就召开了促进大会。会上，有的工人连续上台讲三、四次话，用一次比一次更高的作业指标，向同伴们挑战。
    元旦，这个1959年的第一天，岭西矿的矿工们又用自己新的成就再一次告诉了人们只有空前并无绝后的道理。
    这一天，计划产量是三千八百吨，超过去年平均日产量八百吨，三班作业，每班平均是一千二百七十吨。当天，第一班的工人就提出：全年看一月，一月看元旦，元旦看一班；出勤满堂红，元旦红、一月红、全年红、月月红。结果，这个第一班，生产了一千八百吨煤，全天出煤四千二百吨，超过原定计划四百吨。接着，掘进日进尺，也由一百五十公尺，跃进到了三百一十五点五公尺，创造了全矿的最高纪录。
    新年第一炮打得很响，给1月份满月红、全年月月红揭开了序幕。一开始确定1月份计划产煤十一万四千五百吨的时候，有的人都摇头，认为这是个冒险的计划，结果却完成了十三万零一百四十九吨，超过计划一万五千六百四十九吨。在掘进方面，计划是五千一百二十七公尺，结果完成了五千九百九十一公尺，超过计划八百六十四公尺。
    1月份的胜利，许多过去认定了枯井翻不了身的人，也承认这个矿今年更大更好更全面跃进是完全有把握了。他们说，从1月份的实迹推算，全年应该完成一百五十万吨，而不是九十万吨。唐诗云：水深波浪阔。岭西矿的群众运动又何尝不是这样哩！
        今日红旗属谁家
    一月，给岭西人指出了一个鹏程万里的前景。但是，人们也没有忘记，要获得更大的成就，就要更艰辛的劳动。基于这个信念，今年的春节，又出现了一番空前未有的豪迈景象。
    大年初一的清早，井口贴满了大字报，有诗歌、有快板，有的只写了两句话，形式不一，意思只有一个，就是要出勤。原来矿工们事先了解到元旦这一天，领导上已经安排机修任务，不要大家下井了。大家却自动报名参加装储煤工作。这一报名，招来了不小的麻烦。各坑的干部花了九牛二虎的力气动员他们回去，但是，劝谁谁也不肯回。他们说：“咱们是来装储煤的，可不是来挣工资。”干部们说：“人多挤在一起，没有这么多工具，窝工多不好。”可是工人们又说：“这是咱们对国家对钢铁表示的一点心意，没有工具可有一双手啊！”后来，发觉队伍里有一批女工，于是就去动员她们。这一动员，可惹得一个叫姜春芝的女工生气了，她责问支部书记说：“作兴这样吗？动员男的不走，就来撵咱们女的，你说咱比不上男子汉，那就瞧吧！”说着，她领着一帮子女工，跳上煤堆子就担起煤来了。…………
    这几天，矿上正在准备评选红旗单位。
    “今日红旗属谁家？”这是各级党组织最犯难的事情。（附图片）
