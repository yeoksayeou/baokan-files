Xinhua News Agency, February 28th dispatch from Léopoldville: The struggle of Africans in the Belgian Congo against colonialism continues to develop. On the 26th, in Thysville, a city one hundred miles south of Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, another demonstration of Africans refusing to pay the 1959 taxes to the colonial authorities broke out.

According to reports, the demonstration by the local Africans took place in front of the administrative offices where salaries were paid by the colonial authorities. Colonial police rushed to disperse the demonstrating crowds, and the Africans resisted, throwing stones at the police cars. Later, the colonial authorities dispatched troops to suppress the demonstration and arrested some of the demonstrators.

Other reports say that a similar demonstration took place a few days ago in Inkisi, not far from Thysville.

There are reports that demonstrations by Africans resisting the colonialists continue to occur in Léopoldville.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 27th: The hunger strike and strike by youths from French Equatorial Africa here to protest the massacre of Africans by French imperialism has entered its second day.

The protest was initiated by the United Federation of Equatorial African Youth in the UAR.

In a statement issued today, the Federation said that since 1955, the people of Equatorial Africa have been waging a struggle against French imperialist armed aggression and for independence and freedom. De Gaulle's rise to power has worsened the situation because he imposed a "referendum" on the African people, ignoring their strong opposition to his "constitution." He pursued a policy of terror and repression, resulting in popular uprisings in Central Congo and Chad.

The statement pointed out that the French imperialists' heinous actions of massacring African people on a large scale with airplanes, artillery, and tanks cannot weaken the will of the people struggling for independence and freedom. In fact, the flames of revolution are still burning fiercely throughout Equatorial Africa.

The Federation has decided to continue the hunger strike and strike, and has decided to send telegrams to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and French President De Gaulle, condemning the atrocities committed by French imperialists in the Congo.

The Federation said that the youth of Equatorial Africa will continue to fight until the last occupying soldier withdraws from the region.

    争取独立的火焰在非洲猛烈燃烧
    比属刚果非洲人举行示威拒绝向殖民当局纳税
    法属赤道非洲青年进行绝食斗争抗议法军暴行
    新华社28日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果非洲人反抗殖民主义的斗争继续在发展。26日，在比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔以南一百英里的太斯维尔城，又爆发了非洲人拒绝向殖民当局缴纳1959年税款的抗税示威。
    据报道，当地非洲人的这次示威是在殖民当局支付薪水的行政机关门前举行的。殖民警察赶来，企图驱散示威群众，这些非洲人进行了反抗，并且向警察的汽车扔石头。后来，殖民当局出动了军队，进行镇压，并且逮捕了一些示威者。
    另外有消息说，几天前，在离太斯维尔不远的茵基西也发生了类似的示威。
    有消息说，在利奥波德维尔，仍然不断发生非洲人反抗殖民者的示威行动。
    新华社开罗27日电　在这里的法属赤道非洲青年为抗议法帝国主义屠杀非洲人而举行的绝食和罢课已经进入第二天。
    这次抗议斗争是由在阿联的赤道非洲青年联合会发动的。
    这个联合会在今天发表的声明中说，从1955年以来，赤道非洲人民一直在进行着反对法帝国主义的武装侵略和争取独立和自由的斗争。戴高乐上台以后，使局势恶化了，因为他不顾非洲人民对他的“宪法”的强烈反对，把“公民投票”强加在他们的头上。他奉行恐怖和高压政策，结果，在中央刚果和乍得爆发了人民起义。
    声明指出，法帝国主义者这种用飞机、大炮和坦克对非洲人民进行大规模屠杀的罪恶行动，决不能削弱为争取独立和自由而进行斗争的人民的意志。实际上，革命的火焰仍在整个赤道非洲猛烈地燃烧着。
    这个联合会决定继续进行绝食和罢课斗争，并且决定打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和法国总统戴高乐，谴责法帝国主义者在刚果所犯的暴行。
    联合会说，赤道非洲青年将继续斗争到最后一名占领军撤出这个地区时为止。
