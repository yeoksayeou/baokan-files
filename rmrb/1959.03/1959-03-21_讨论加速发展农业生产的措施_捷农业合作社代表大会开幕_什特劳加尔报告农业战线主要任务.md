Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 19th: The Fourth National Congress of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives of Czechoslovakia grandly opened in Prague today. More than 1,500 delegates from all over the country and more than 500 guests gathered in the Prague National Assembly Hall, which was decorated for the festival. This congress will discuss the tasks put forward for agriculture by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and formulate measures to increase agricultural production and accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Štrougal delivered the main report at the congress. He said that the area of land cultivated by unified agricultural cooperatives now accounts for 73.5% of the total cultivated land in Czechoslovakia, and 80.9% of rural areas have established cooperatives.

Štrougal pointed out that the large-scale production of agricultural cooperatives has proven its superiority. The total output of agricultural products in 1958 increased by 19.9% compared with 1949, and marketable agricultural products increased by 55.7% compared with 1949. Particularly significant is the increase in labor productivity. A full-time agricultural worker produced almost 81% more agricultural products in 1957 than in 1936. He emphasized that the successful establishment of socialism in the countryside proves the correctness and foresight of the Czechoslovak Communist Party's policies.

Štrougal emphasized that further developing agriculture and increasing agricultural production are currently key issues for Czechoslovakia in completing socialist construction. When talking about the main tasks facing agriculture, he pointed out that first, attention must be paid to the development of crop production; investment in land must be increased so that the fertility of the land is greatly increased; new large-scale production technologies must be adopted, and the application of mechanization and chemicals must be greatly expanded; in order to improve the enthusiasm of the working people, the principle of material encouragement must be correctly implemented in every socialist agricultural enterprise. Feed production will occupy a primary position in the entire crop production structure. The planting area of ​​high-yield feed crops, especially corn, must be expanded, and grasslands and pastures must be better utilized.

When talking about increasing livestock products, he pointed out that attention must first be paid to livestock breeding. He pointed out that the basic issue in developing livestock production is to widely adopt large-scale production technologies while ensuring a sufficient feed base.

Štrougal said that it is necessary to help backward agricultural cooperatives catch up with advanced cooperatives as soon as possible. He called on the representatives of advanced agricultural cooperatives attending the conference to send their cadres and cooperative members to those backward cooperatives to help them work for a year or longer.

Finally, he talked about the need to promulgate a new law on unified agricultural cooperatives, which will include all the basic reforms that have been implemented domestically.

    讨论加速发展农业生产的措施
    捷农业合作社代表大会开幕
    什特劳加尔报告农业战线主要任务
    据新华社布拉格19日电　捷克斯洛伐克第四届全国统一农业合作社代表大会今天在布拉格隆重开幕。一千五百多名来自全国各地的代表们和五百多名来宾聚集在披着节日盛装的布拉格国会大厦里。这次代表大会将讨论捷共第十一次代表大会为农业提出的任务，并制定增加农产品生产和加速农业社会主义改造的措施。
    农林部长什特劳加尔在大会上作了主要报告。他说，目前统一农业合作社耕种的土地面积已占捷克斯洛伐克全部耕地面积的73.5％，有80.9％的农村已建立了合作社。
    什特劳加尔指出，农业合作社的大规模生产已经证明了它的优越性。1958年的农产品总产量比1949年增加了19.9％，而商品农产品比1949年增加了55.7％。特别显著的是劳动生产率的提高，一个长年农业工人在1957年生产的农产品几乎比1936年增加81％。他强调说，在农村中成功地建立了社会主义，这证明捷克斯洛伐克共产党的政策的正确性和远见性。
    什特劳加尔强调说，进一步发展农业，增加农产品的生产在目前是捷克斯洛伐克完成社会主义建设的关键性问题。在谈到农业面临的主要任务时，他指出，首先必须重视发展农作物生产的问题；必须增加对土地的投资以便使土地的肥沃程度大大增加；采用新的大规模生产技术，大大扩大机械化和化学品的应用；为了提高劳动人民的积极性，必须在每个社会主义农业企业内正确地执行物质鼓励的原则。饲料生产在整个农作物生产结构中将占首要地位，必须扩大高产饲料作物，特别是玉蜀黍的种植面积，要更好地利用草原和牧场。
    在谈到增加畜产品时，他指出，首先必须注意牲畜饲养的工作，他指出，在发展畜产品生产方面的基本问题是广泛采用大规模生产技术，同时确保一个够用的饲料基地。
    什特劳加尔说，必须帮助落后的农业合作社，使他们尽快地赶上先进的合作社，他号召参加大会的先进农业合作社的代表们把他们的干部和合作社社员送到那些落后的合作社里，帮助它们工作一年或更长的时期。
    最后，他谈到必须就统一农业合作社问题颁布一项新的法律，其中将包含目前在国内已经实行的一切基本改革。
