Managing and Utilizing the Bumper Harvest of Grain Well
Shandong Conducts Comprehensive Inspection, Rationally Arranges Grain Use

Jinan Dispatch from our newspaper on the 24th. Shandong Province is launching a spring grain general survey throughout the region. In order to properly store the state and commune's grain reserves, establish and improve grain storage systems, and achieve "seven no's" and "four no's" in granaries, Shandong Province has launched a spring grain storage general survey movement in most areas, involving checking grain, checking oil, checking potato crops, checking warehouses, and checking systems. Only in Liaocheng and Zibo districts and Qingdao City, more than 3,000 cadres have been organized to go deep into state and commune granaries for a general survey at the end of February and the beginning of March. Many areas have achieved a simultaneous focus on state and commune warehouses, equal emphasis on grain and oil, and a thorough inspection of every warehouse. During the survey, grain that was beginning to mold and deteriorate was promptly rescued.

Many areas have achieved "five clears" through the general survey, namely, the location of grain, oil, and potato storage is clear, the variety and quantity are clear, the accounts and procedures are clear, the safety situation is clear, and the equipment, tools, and agents are clear. This ensures the safety of grain storage in state and commune warehouses.

In order to rapidly improve the grain storage work of the people's communes to the level of state granary storage, some areas are actively training commune grain storage personnel, and many units are actively establishing commune warehouse management systems through the spring grain general survey. In Boxing County, in addition to equipping each commune, management area, and production team with full-time storage personnel, the county also separates state and commune grain storage, seed grain, and cafeteria grain into three categories. More than 2,500 warehouses in the county have established grain storage cards, and universal grain allocation procedures and a system of surveying every seven days and checking at any time during wind and rain have also been established.

Jinan Dispatch from our newspaper on the 24th. People's communes in Shandong are comprehensively arranging grain use in conjunction with the rectification of the communes, in order to achieve planned grain use, better arrange the lives of commune members, and effectively support spring production. When arranging grain use, all areas focus on cafeteria grain, and also arrange grain for feed and seeds. According to recent incomplete statistics, more than 70% of the province's 17,000+ public canteens have made comprehensive arrangements for grain use.

Currently, the general practice for people's grain consumption is to adopt the method of graded rations, with a one-time contract to the end. That is, based on the production situation of the commune, all grain uses are arranged to the wheat harvest, contracted to the production team cafeteria; each production team implements graded and quantified rations based on the grain ration standards stipulated by the commune, and eats with meal tickets. While implementing graded and quantified grain rations with a one-time contract to the end, all areas have also established a unified grain management system, ensuring that state granaries, commune granaries, and cafeteria granaries are strictly separated, and strengthening the planned management of grain. Many communes have universally strengthened the management of cafeterias, better improving meals, ensuring that commune members eat their fill and eat well, while avoiding waste.

Due to the comprehensive arrangement of grain use, achieving planned grain use, not only has grain been saved and waste eliminated, but also the production enthusiasm of commune members has been greatly encouraged. According to statistics from Pingyuan, Pingyi, Qixia, Yiyuan and other counties, before the implementation of graded and quantified rations, each person consumed 44.6 catties of grain per month, and after the implementation of graded and quantified rations, it was reduced to 30.13 catties. Pingyuan County saved more than 370,000 catties of grain in January alone. Many commune members reflected: with a clear understanding of grain use and a plan for grain consumption, we can put our minds at ease and devote ourselves wholeheartedly to production. Many communes' members have all come up with their own plans for saving grain, and sold their surplus grain to the cafeterias and the state.

    把丰收的粮食管好用好
    山东全面检查，合理安排用粮
    本报济南24日电　山东省各地展开春季粮食大普查。为了保管好国家和公社的储粮，建立和健全粮食保管制度，实现“七无”和“四无”粮仓，山东省大部地区展开了查粮食、查油料、查薯类、查仓房、查制度的春季储粮大普查运动。仅聊城、淄博二个地区和青岛市即已组织三千多名干部，于2月底3月初分别深入国家和公社的粮库进行普查。许多地区做到了国、社库并举，粮油并重，有仓必查，查必彻底。普查中发现开始发霉变质的粮食，随即组织力量进行了抢救。
    很多地区通过普查做到了“五清”，即粮、油、薯类存放地点清，品种数量清，账目手续清，安全情况清，器材用具药剂清。保证了国、社库储粮的安全。
    为使人民公社的粮食保管工作迅速提高到国家粮库保管的水平，有些地区积极训练公社粮食保管人员，还有不少单位通过春季粮食大普查积极建立公社仓库管理制度。博兴县除了各公社、管理区、生产队都配备了专职保管人员，并做到了国、社库储粮、种籽粮、食堂粮三分开，全县有二千五百多座仓房建立了存粮卡片，还普遍建立了粮食支拨手续及七天一普查、风雨随时检查的制度。　　　（曹树先）
    本报济南24日电　山东各地人民公社正结合整社全面安排公社用粮，以达到用粮有计划，更好地安排社员群众生活和有力地支持春季生产。各地在安排用粮时，以食堂用粮为中心，同时安排了饲料、种子等用粮。据最近不完全的统计，全省一万七千多处公社公共食堂，70％以上食堂对用粮进行了全面安排。
    现在全省人民吃粮一般采取分等定量，一次包干到底的办法。即根据本社生产情况，对各项用粮一次安排到麦收，包干到生产队食堂；各生产队根据公社规定的口粮标准，实行按人分等定量，凭饭票吃饭。在实行粮食分等定量、一次包干到底的同时，各地还建立了统一管理粮食的制度，作到国库、社库、食堂库严格分开，加强粮食的计划管理。许多公社普遍地加强了对食堂的管理，更好地改善伙食，保证社员吃饱吃好，又不浪费。
    由于全面地安排了用粮，作到用粮有计划，不仅节约了粮食，杜绝了浪费，而且大大地鼓舞了社员生产积极性。据平原、平邑、栖霞、沂源等县统计，未实行分等定量前，每人每月食用粮食四十四点六斤，实行分等定量后，降为三十点十三斤。平原县1月份即节约粮食三十七万余斤。许多社员反映：用粮有底，吃粮有谱，放下心思，好全心全力地搞生产了。不少社的社员都打出了个人节约用粮的谱，并把自己多余的存粮卖给食堂和国家。
