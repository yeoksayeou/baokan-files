    Exchange Information, Know Yourself and Your Enemy, Fully Cooperate
    Taiyuan Industry and Commerce Departments Jointly Arrange Production of Daily-Use Industrial Products

    (Our report) The Taiyuan City light industrial production departments have strengthened their ties and cooperation with the commercial departments, arranging the production of daily-use industrial products according to market changes and needs. This closely integrates production, supply, and sales, ensuring the satisfaction of market needs and promoting the development of light industry.

    In the past, the vast majority of Taiyuan City's daily-use industrial products had to be purchased from other places. This year, the supply from other places has been greatly reduced, while sales have greatly increased. In this situation, how to arrange the production of daily-use industrial products this year to meet market needs has become the most pressing issue for the light industry and commercial departments.

    To solve this problem, the Taiyuan City light industrial production departments first started by strengthening ties with the commercial departments. The main forms of contact and cooperation between industry and commerce in Taiyuan City are: First, irregular industry-commerce cooperation meetings are held frequently, with the participation of production, supply, and sales representatives. In addition to studying market changes and mass needs, these meetings also actively promote cooperation through mutual "stocktaking." The commercial departments put forward a series of improvement suggestions to the production departments regarding product specifications, quality, and variety. For example, the winter market needs dark-colored velvet clothing such as black and green, but the textile factory produces more light-colored velvet clothing, and there are fewer large sizes and more small sizes. The textile factory immediately accepted this suggestion and quickly made improvements.

    The content of the consultations between the production departments and the commercial departments has also been fixed in the form of contracts. At present, 67% of the commodities in the city's department store, electrical appliance, textile, and native product sectors have been arranged. In the arrangement, because both sides have understood their respective situations, the idea of industry and commerce as one, facing the overall situation, has been greatly promoted, and the spirit of cooperation has been greatly enhanced. In view of market needs, the production departments try their best to increase productivity and increase output. For example, the Taiyuan Knitting Factory originally planned to produce 100,000 dozen gloves this year, more than doubling last year's production, but the market needs 200,000 dozen. The factory volunteered to overcome difficulties, improve equipment, and innovate technology, increasing production by another 30% on the original basis.

    The commercial departments also overcame the purely profit-oriented viewpoint, vigorously supported the light industrial production departments in trial-producing new products, and actively assisted the production departments in solving the difficulties of insufficient raw materials. For example, the Taiyuan Food Company saw that the soap factory had difficulties in obtaining oil materials to produce 180,000 boxes of soap this year, so it allocated livestock bones that could be used to extract oil after slaughter to the Taiyuan Chemical Fertilizer Factory to solve part of the oil material problem. The benefit of this kind of contact and cooperation is that it not only meets market needs and promotes commercial work, but also promotes the development of light industry.

    Another form of industry-commerce contact in Taiyuan City is the joint organization of investigation, research, and arrangement teams to conduct in-depth investigations and research in various stores, specialized companies, and factories regarding market needs and factory production. Problems are discovered and solved at any time, and whatever commodities are lacking, production is arranged accordingly. This team recently discovered that the market urgently needs a large number of small hardware products such as shoe eyelets, collar buttons, and trouser hooks, so it adopted the method of one factory engaging in multiple operations, and decided to use old equipment in the Yonghe Enamel Factory and use the offcuts of enamel product manufacture to arrange the production of a portion of small hardware products. For some commodities that are in the greatest demand in the market and can be produced in the city, the Light Industry Bureau is in the process of adjusting some factories to carry out production.

    互通情报　知己知彼　全力协作
    太原工商部门共同安排日用工业品生产
    本报讯　太原市轻工业生产部门加强与商业部门的联系和协作，根据市场变化规律与市场需要来安排日用工业品的生产。使产、供、销密切结合，既保证满足市场需要，又促进了轻工业的发展。
    过去，太原市的日用工业品绝大部分要靠外地进货，今年外地货源大大减少，而销售额又大大增加了。在这样的情况，如何安排好今年日用工业品的生产，满足市场需要，就成了当前轻工业和商业部门最迫切的问题。
    为了解决这个问题，太原市轻工业生产部门首先从加强与商业部门的联系着手。太原市工商之间联系协作的主要形式有二：第一是经常举行由产、供、销三方面参加的不定期工商协作会议。这种会议除了研究市场变化规律、群众需要外，还通过互相摆“家底”，积极开展协作。商业部门对生产部门的产品规格、质量、花色品种提出了一系列的改进意见。例如冬季市场需要黑、绿等深色绒衣，但纺织厂出的绒衣浅色的比较多，而且尺寸大的少、小的多。纺织厂立即接受了这个意见，迅速作了改进。
    生产部门和商业部门协商的内容，还用合同形式固定了下来。目前全市百货、交电、纺织、土产等四个部门已有67％的商品得到了安排。在安排中由于双方都摸清了家底，因而工商一家，面向全局的思想大兴，协作之风大长。生产部门鉴于市场需要，尽量设法提高生产力，增加产量。如太原针织厂原来计划今年生产十万打手套，比去年生产量翻了一番还多，但市场需要二十万打。这个厂就自告奋勇，决心克服困难，改进设备、革新技术，在原有的基础上再增产30％。
    商业部门也克服了单纯利润观点，大力支持轻工业生产部门试制新产品，并积极协助生产部门解决某些原材料不足的困难。如太原市食品公司看到肥皂厂今年生产十八万箱肥皂油料有困难，就把屠宰后能熬油的牲畜骨头拨给太原化工农肥厂解决一部分油料问题。这种联系和协作的好处，不仅满足了市场的需要，推动了商业工作，而且也促进了轻工业的发展。
    太原市工商联系另一种形式是联合组织调查、研究、安排小组，专门深入各商店、专业公司、各工厂调查研究市场需要与工厂生产情况。随时发现问题随时解决，缺什么商品，安排什么生产。这个小组最近发现市场迫切需要大批鞋眼、领扣、裤钩等小五金商品，便采取一厂搞多种经营的办法，决定在永和搪瓷厂利用旧设备，制造搪瓷制品的边料，安排一部分小五金商品的生产。对于一些市场需要量最大而本市又能生产的商品，轻工业局正着手调整一些厂子进行生产。
