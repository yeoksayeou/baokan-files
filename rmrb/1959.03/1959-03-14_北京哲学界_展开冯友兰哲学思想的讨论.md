Philosophical Circles in Beijing
Launch Discussion on Feng Youlan's Philosophical Thought

    Over the past two months, philosophical circles in Beijing have launched a discussion on Feng Youlan's philosophical thought. In January of this year, Feng Youlan published an article entitled "The Prototype of New Rationalism" in "Philosophical Research," providing a comprehensive self-criticism of his so-called "writings during the Zhenyuan period" (referring to his works during the anti-Japanese war). He admitted that the political aim of these works was "to make people wholeheartedly support the semi-feudal, semi-colonial society and the Kuomintang regime at that time," and he admitted that he adopted covert means to oppose Marxism. He further conceded that the so-called "abstract inheritance method" he proposed in January 1957 was merely a revamp of old ideas. In the same issue, "Philosophical Research" published Wang Zisong's article "Whom Does Feng Youlan's Philosophy Serve?" The second issue of "Philosophical Research" this year also published Guan Feng's article "Exposing the Prototype of the 'New Man'." Through concrete analysis of the book "The New Man," these articles criticized Feng Youlan's philosophical thought. Recently, Feng Youlan published an article titled "Questions and Inquiries" in the third issue of "Philosophical Research," offering a response. In addition, the second issue of "New Construction" this year also published Ren Hua's article "How New Rationalism Peddles New Realism," criticizing its reactionary and anti-scientific nature by examining how New Rationalism peddled the reactionary philosophy of the modern foreign bourgeoisie – New Realism.

    In his article, Wang Zisong stated that Feng Youlan was able to link his past philosophy with the reactionary politics of the time and was able to reveal himself as a cunning idealist who admitted to opposing Marxists in a covert manner, which grasped the essence of the problem. However, it is not clear where he used the guise of a supra-philosophical camp to oppose materialism, used supra-class to oppose class struggle, used impracticality to cover up serving actual politics, and used abstraction to propagate reactionary views on concrete social life. The author used historical evidence to reveal the political essence of the "Four Realms" theory. For example, the author believes that Feng Youlan's inclusion of both heroes and traitors under the concept of "selfishness" is actually slandering historical figures, especially contemporary heroes, while elevating traitors; Feng Youlan's "fulfilling moral duties and responsibilities" is also a sophistry that distorts truth and slanders the People's Army. Wang Zisong also believes that the "abstraction" advocated by Feng Youlan is a deliberate obliteration of the essence of things, an abstraction that facilitates the distortion of truth, and is by no means a scientific abstraction.

    Guan Feng's article deeply analyzes Feng Youlan's philosophical system. He believes that Feng Youlan's philosophical system has "New Rationalism" as its head, "The New Man" as its body, "The Realm of Heaven and Earth," or "attaining the highest brightness and following the middle path," as its internal organs, and "New Family Instructions" and "New Origins of the Way" as its wings. Feng Youlan affirmed the old Chinese semi-feudal and semi-colonial social order through this set of theories, asking people to abide by this order and attain "liberation" in spirit, be content with the status quo, and be content with their positions. Politically speaking, Feng Youlan's philosophy objectively played a role in preparing public opinion and ideology for Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang to surrender to Japanese imperialism. The author said that in terms of the source of thought, the mainstream of Chinese philosophy is materialism and dialectics. Feng Youlan not only did not inherit this mainstream, but also did not inherit the relatively rational idealist systems. What he inherited was the worst countercurrent of idealism, mainly Gongsun Long, especially Zhuangzi. The difference is that his philosophical system is more reactionary and decadent than Zhuangzi's philosophy. The author pointed out that these criticisms are not settling old scores with Feng Youlan because his original political stance has changed, and he is now working for the socialist New China, and those books are a thing of the past. It is only because the philosophical system of New Rationalism has not yet undergone due analysis in terms of academic thought, and therefore has not been completely abandoned by its author, that it is still worth discussing.

    In his article "Questions and Inquiries," Feng Youlan stated that he basically agreed with the opinions of Wang and Guan that they had "made a profound class analysis of 'The New Man,' completely exposing the actual meaning and class roots of 'The New Man'," and believed that their analysis of the reactionary role that his so-called ideal life objectively played at the time "is completely correct."

    As for Guan Feng's view that the "Four Realms" are all "groundless fabrications," he does not completely agree. He believes that only the "Realm of Heaven and Earth" is fabricated, and the other three realms are real. He said, "'Realm' may not be an appropriate term, but I feel that those distinctions still exist." And he said: "Since liberation, in our new society, I feel that these distinctions are becoming more and more obvious." He agrees that his abstract principle of "fulfilling moral duties and responsibilities" in "The New Man" as a standard for measuring all behavior is indeed subjective idealism. As for the system of "New Rationalism," it is basically objective idealism. He said, "From a class point of view, it is absurd to abstractly propose 'fulfilling moral duties and responsibilities' as a moral standard," and "'The New Man' proposes 'consciousness' and 'understanding' as standards for judging the level of a person's realm... is also absurd." He said that on the issue of inheritance, on some points, he "has not yet figured it out, and feels that it is sometimes clear and sometimes confused." He also talked about the use of certain terms related to the superstructure. Finally, he asked everyone to continue to criticize and help him.

### 北京哲学界  展开冯友兰哲学思想的讨论

    北京哲学界
    展开冯友兰哲学思想的讨论
    最近两个多月来，北京哲学界展开了冯友兰哲学思想的讨论。今年1月间冯友兰在“哲学研究”上发表了“新理学的原形”一文，对他在抗日战争时期写的所谓“贞元之际所著书”，作了综合的自我批评。他承认这些著作的政治目的，“就是要人一心一意拥护当时半封建、半殖民地的社会和国民党政权”，并且承认他采取了隐蔽的方式反对马克思主义，而他在1957年1月间提出的所谓“抽象继承法”，也就是旧思想的翻版。同期的“哲学研究”发表了汪子嵩的“冯友兰的哲学是为谁服务的”一文，今年“哲学研究”第二期又发表了关锋的“揭露‘新原人’的原形”一文。它们通过对“新原人”一书的具体分析，对冯友兰的哲学思想作了批评。最近冯友兰在“哲学研究”第三期上又发表了题为“质疑和请教”一文，作了答辩。此外，今年“新建设”第二期，也发表了任华写的“新理学是怎样贩运新实在论观点的”文章，从新理学怎样贩运了现代外国资产阶级的反动哲学——新实在论，批评了它的反动性和反科学性。
    汪子嵩在文章中说，冯友兰能将自己过去的哲学和当时的反动政治联系起来考察，而且能够揭露自己是个狡猾的唯心主义者，承认以隐蔽的方式反对马克思主义者，是抓住了问题的实质。但是究竟在哪些地方以超哲学阵营为掩护来反对唯物主义，以超阶级为掩护来反对阶级斗争，以不着实际为掩护来为实际政治服务，以抽象为掩护来宣传对具体社会人生的反动主张，则不太明白。作者通过用史实的印证，揭露了“四境界”说的政治实质。如作者认为冯友兰将英雄和奸雄都归入“利己”概念，实际上是诬蔑历史上的，特别是当时的英雄人物，而抬高汉奸卖国贼；冯友兰的“尽伦尽职”同样是颠倒黑白，污蔑人民军队的诡辩。汪子嵩还认为，冯友兰主张的“抽象”是故意抹煞事物本质的抽象，是便于颠倒黑白的抽象，决不是科学的抽象。
    关锋的文章深入地分析了冯友兰的哲学系统。他认为，冯友兰的哲学系统，“新理学”是头，“新原人”是身体，“天地境界”或者叫做“极高明而道中庸”是内脏，“新世训”、“新原道”则是它的羽翼。冯友兰就是通过这一套理论肯定了旧中国半封建半殖民地的社会秩序，要人们遵照这个秩序行事，并在精神上得到“解脱”，安于现状，安于他处的地位。从政治上说来，冯友兰的哲学在客观上起了为蒋介石国民党准备投降日本帝国主义作舆论上、思想上的准备的作用。作者说，在思想源流上说来，中国哲学的主流是唯物主义和辩证法，冯友兰不但不是继承这个主流，而且比较有理性的唯心主义系统之流，他也没有继承，他继承的乃是最坏的唯心主义的逆流，最主要的就是公孙龙，尤其是庄子。所不同的是他的哲学系统比庄子哲学更为反动和堕落。作者指出，这些批评，并不是和冯友兰算旧账，因为他的原来的政治立场已经改变了，现在正为社会主义的新中国工作，而那些书也已是过去的事了。只由于新理学的哲学系统，还没有从学术思想上作出应有的分析，因此也就没有完全被它的作者所抛弃，所以还值得讨论。
    冯友兰在他的“质疑和请教”一文中表示基本上同意汪、关两人“对于新原人作了深刻的阶级分析，完全揭露了‘新原人’的实际意义和阶级根源”的意见，并认为两人对他的所谓理想人生，在当时客观上所起的反动作用的分析，“是完全正确的”。
    至于关锋认为“四种境界”都是“毫无根据的虚构”，他不完全同意。他认为只有“天地境界”是虚构的，其他三种境界都是实有的。他说，“‘境界’这个名词也许不恰当，但那些区别我觉得还是有的”。并说：“自从解放以来，在我们新社会里，我觉得这些区别，越来越明显。”他同意他在“新原人”中提出“尽伦尽职”这个抽象原则，作为衡量一切行为的标准，确实是主观唯心主义的。至于“新理学”的体系，基本上还是客观唯心主义的。他说，“从阶级观点来看，抽象地提出‘尽伦尽职’作为道德的标准是荒谬的”，“‘新原人’提出‘自觉’‘了解’作为判定人的境界的高低的标准……也是荒谬的。”他说，关于继承问题上，在某些点上，他“还没有想通，觉得有时清楚，有时糊涂。”他还谈到某些与上层建筑有关的名词的使用问题。最后，他要求大家继续批评帮助。
