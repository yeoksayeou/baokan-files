    Comprehensive Study of Knowledge
    Jin Wen
    Under the slogan "emphasizing practice and theory, actively participating in production labor, and settling down to study diligently," students at Tianjin Normal University are studying conscientiously and working diligently. This new style of learning is worth promoting.
    Production labor, centered on teaching and aimed at improving teaching quality, is an effective method to combine theory and practice, enriching and solidifying students' theoretical knowledge from the classroom. The Chinese and History departments of Tianjin Normal University have organized students to conduct social surveys in factories and rural areas, and to work alongside workers and peasants, in conjunction with courses such as "Modern History" and "Modern Revolutionary History," with good results. However, some individuals, after acquiring some initial labor skills through production labor, believe that there is no need to further enrich themselves theoretically, which is clearly a misunderstanding of knowledge.
    What is comprehensive knowledge? It is the combination of perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge. Those lacking perceptual knowledge should obtain it from social practice, that is, participate in the struggle for production and class struggle. Those lacking rational knowledge should acquire it through diligent study, that is, study conscientiously, accepting knowledge that predecessors or older generations have proven or summarized from practice. Therefore, our Party requires that school education be combined with productive labor, and the study of theory be combined with practical application. Combining the two will achieve the goal of learning comprehensive knowledge.
    Young students lack not only rational knowledge but also perceptual knowledge. If they can study diligently and work conscientiously, they can study well, work well, and think well in an all-round way, becoming working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. Currently, our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly, with new industrial bases and batches of factories growing from the ground up, and our agriculture is also developing by leaps and bounds. People's communes have opened up broad avenues for agricultural mechanization and electrification. The country needs a large number of knowledgeable specialists and experts in various sciences to participate in construction and transform nature. Under this situation, young students should, as Marx said, climb the peaks of science, be unafraid of difficulties, and not fear hardships. While actively participating in production labor, they should study diligently and tenaciously march towards the fortress of science.

    全面地学习知识
    津文
    天津师范大学在“既重视实践，又重视理论，既能积极参加生产劳动，又能坐下来安心读书”的口号下，学生们踏踏实实地读书，勤勤恳恳地劳动。这种新的学风，是值得提倡的。
    以教学为中心，以提高教学质量为目的的生产劳动，是使理论和实际相结合的有效方法，可以使学生的课堂理论知识更加丰富和全面，学到的知识更加巩固。天津师大中文系和历史系结合“近代史”、“现代革命史”等课程的学习，一面组织学生下厂矿、下农村作社会调查，一面同工人农民一起劳动，效果都很好。但是也有个别的人经过生产劳动，初步掌握了一些劳动技能以后，就认为不需要在理论上继续充实自己了，这显然是对知识的一种误解。
    什么是全面知识呢？就是感性知识要和理性知识相结合。缺乏感性知识的要从社会实践中得到感性知识，也就要参加生产斗争和阶级斗争；缺乏理性知识的要从努力读书获得理性知识，也就要踏踏实实地读书，从书本上接受前人或老一辈已经从实践中证实或总结了的知识。因此，我们党要求学校教育要和生产劳动相结合，学习理论要和联系实际相结合。两者一结合，就能达到学好全面知识的目的。
    青年学生，不仅缺乏理性知识，也缺乏感性知识。如果能够踏踏实实地读书，勤勤恳恳地劳动，就能够全面地学习好，劳动好，思想好，作一个又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。现在，我国的社会主义建设，正在一日千里地发展，新的工业基地、成批的工厂正在从平地上成长起来，我们的农业也在飞跃发展，人民公社为农业机械化、电气化开辟了广阔的道路。国家到处需要大批有知识的专门人才、各门科学的专家来参加建设，改造自然。在这种形势下，青年学生应该像马克思所说的，攀登科学的高峰，要不怕困难，不畏艰险。在积极参加生产劳动的同时，勤奋地读书，顽强地向科学堡垒进军。
