Animal husbandry increase and protection competition sweeps the region
Urumqi, March 27 (By our reporter) The farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, implementing the Autonomous Region Party Committee's policy of simultaneously promoting agriculture and animal husbandry and developing animal husbandry production at high speed, have achieved initial results. The lambing of the 1.5 million densely bred sheep mated last year has basically ended, with a lamb survival rate generally above 95% and a twin lamb rate generally exceeding 5%. At present, a competition movement centered on increasing and protecting livestock is rapidly developing in various places.

The Party committees at all levels in the vast pastoral areas have made remarkable achievements in implementing the eight basic measures for developing animal husbandry: "grass, fodder, water, breed, reproduction, protection, management, and labor." Last year, the Party organizations at all levels in the Altay region led the Kazakh herdsmen to plant fodder grass and fodder on 114,000 mu of land, harvesting more than 30 million jin of fodder alone, enabling all pregnant female animals to receive good supplementary feeding in winter and spring. At the same time, due to large-scale water conservancy construction and irrigation of grasslands in natural pastures, the pasture grass flourished, allowing all 1.7 million livestock in the region to be fat and strong before winter, smoothly passing the severe winter, and greatly reducing the phenomena of livestock weakness, death, and miscarriage.

In the Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, from the prefecture and county levels to the communes and production teams, there are two teams of people, one focusing on agriculture and the other on animal husbandry. Leading comrades of the prefecture and county Party and government organizations lead working groups to conduct inspections and implement the method of establishing key points, assigning responsibilities at different levels, and assigning areas of responsibility, increasing the number of herders and establishing a system for increasing and protecting livestock. Before and after lambing, Party committees at all levels universally organized inspections of livestock overwintering conditions and dispatched large numbers of cadres and veterinarians to go deep into the production teams for specific guidance, taking turns day and night to receive and protect the lambs.

In agricultural areas, which account for more than 70% of the Autonomous Region's total livestock, animal husbandry professional teams have now been established, and communes with the necessary conditions are vigorously running ranches. Because the Party has strengthened its leadership over animal husbandry production, communist cooperation has been universally carried out in increasing and protecting livestock. The Hami region and the Altay region have adjusted pasture land, making the pasture land more rationally utilized.

    增畜保畜竞赛遍全区
    本报乌鲁木齐27日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族农牧民，执行自治区党委关于农牧业同时并举，高速度发展畜牧业生产的方针，取得了初步成绩。去年配种的一百五十万只密集繁殖羊，产羔基本结束，羔羊繁殖成活率普遍在95％以上，双羔率一般超过5％。目前以增畜保畜为中心的竞赛运动迅速在各地开展。
    广大牧区的各级党委在贯彻“草、料、水、种、繁、保、管、工”八项发展畜牧业的基本措施方面作出了显著成绩。去年，阿勒泰专区的各级党组织领导哈萨克牧民在十一万四千亩土地上，种植了饲草、饲料，仅饲料一项就收获了三千万斤以上，使全部怀孕母畜在冬春两季得到了良好的补饲，同时由于在天然牧草场上大搞水利建设引水灌溉草原，牧草旺盛，使全专区一百七十多万头牲畜在入冬前都吃得膘肥体壮，顺利地度过了严冬，牲畜瘦弱、死亡和流产的现象大大减少。
    在巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州，从州、县、公社到生产队都备有两班人马，一手抓农业，一手抓畜牧业。州、县党政领导同志带领工作组巡回检查，并且实行了建立重点，分层负责，分片包干的办法，增加放牧人员，建立增畜保畜制度，接羔前后各级党委普遍组织了牲畜越春情况检查，派出了大批干部和兽医人员深入到生产队具体领导，昼夜轮班接羔护羔。
    在占有自治区全部牲畜70％以上的农业区，目前也大都建立了畜牧业专业队，有条件的公社正大力举办牧场。由于党加强了对畜牧业生产的领导，在增畜保畜工作中普遍开展了共产主义的大协作。哈密专区和阿勒泰专区之间进行了牧草场的调剂，使牧草场更加合理利用。
