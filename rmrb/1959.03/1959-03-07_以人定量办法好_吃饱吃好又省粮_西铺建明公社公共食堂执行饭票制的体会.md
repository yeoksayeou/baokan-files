The Method of Setting Quotas Based on People is Good - Eating Well, Eating Enough, and Saving Grain
Experiences of the Jianming People's Commune Public Canteen in Xipu in Implementing the Meal Ticket System
Cao Shoushan, First Secretary of the Zunhua County Party Committee

"The method of setting quotas based on people is good, eating well, eating enough, and saving, with both collective and freedom, the enthusiasm of the commune members is higher than the sky." This is a song of praise from the commune members of the Xipu Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei, after the rural canteen implemented the meal ticket system. Now, all 136 canteens in the Xipu Jianming People's Commune have universally implemented the meal ticket system. In the past two months, they have saved 375,000 jin of grain, which, calculated at 400 jin of grain per person per year, is enough for 937 people to eat for a year.

Eating Also Requires Rules
The Xipu Jianming People's Commune implements a semi-supply system, implementing free meals in the canteen, eliminating the eternal worries of the people in history about food and drink. Commune members no longer have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, salt, etc., and can concentrate on doing a good job in production, in order to improve people's lives to a greater extent. However, after the implementation of free meals, some commune members had misunderstandings: believing that 1958 was a bumper year, there was no need to save on meals; coupled with a lack of management experience in the canteen, and the lack of necessary systems, it was not calculated eating, but eating and then calculating; a few young people even held eating competitions, competing for more and faster. Therefore, it was difficult for the canteen to control the cooking, sometimes there was a lot of leftover food, and sometimes there was not enough, and it had to be re-cooked twice, making both the canteen and the commune members dissatisfied. In order to solve this problem, a limited quantity method was once adopted. As a result, those with large appetites did not have enough to eat, saying that since it was all-inclusive, there was no need to be afraid of big stomachs; those with small appetites could not finish the amount they took back, and the leftovers were used to feed pigs and chickens, and some were dried into sweet potato chips, which was a great waste. This situation was very unsatisfactory to some poor and old commune members, especially those who originally started the commune with "three donkey legs." They said: "Isn't this forgetting to drink vegetable porridge after eating dry rice? As the saying goes: Saving should start at the top of the granary, don't wait until there is no grain to think about having grain, a bumper year should be treated as a lean year, and you won't go hungry in a lean year." Some also said: "At this rate of eating and wasting, even the biggest bumper harvest can't stand it." Most commune members were very worried about this issue, and demanded that eating should also have rules and systems.

Setting Quotas Based on People, Savings Belong to the Individual
In response to the above situation, the commune Party committee immediately held a meeting, and in accordance with the opinions and requirements of the masses, based on the principle of eating well, eating enough, and saving, conducted a detailed study and discussion. Finally, it was decided to allocate quotas to the canteen based on the size of the age group within the average quota of 400 jin per person, and implement the meal ticket system.

When this system was first proposed, some people were dissatisfied, thinking that eating was restricted; some said that saving one or two taels of grain a day was not worth it. In order to unify the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, a debate was launched on the topics of "Is planned grain consumption good?" "Is wasting grain right?" "How can we eat well, eat enough, and save?" "Do you still want to maintain the honor of running the commune and doing everything diligently and frugally?" At the same time, a large account was calculated. Saving one or two taels of grain per person per day seems like nothing, but the entire commune of more than 25,000 people can save more than 500,000 jin a year. Extended to the entire county and the entire country, this is an even more alarming figure. Through recalling the past, presenting facts, and reasoning, thoughts were raised and understanding was unified. Specific measures were formulated according to the opinions of the masses: the commune uniformly contracted the canteens according to the average supply standard of 400 jin per person, which was controlled by the canteens, with responsibility for their own profits and losses. The canteens divided the quotas into seven grades according to age, size, and physical strength within the average quota of 400 jin per person, and implemented a meal ticket system with quotas based on people. The calculations are: 90 jin per year for one year old, 156 jin for two to three years old, 256 jin for four to eight years old, 311 jin for nine to twelve years old, 386 jin for thirteen to seventeen years old, 480 jin for eighteen years old and above, and 540 jin for iron and wood workers. In addition, appropriate care is given to commune members with strong labor and large appetites. In this way, the canteen can uniformly control according to the principle of eating more when busy, eating less when idle, and eating enough whether busy or idle, and issue meal tickets to commune members on a monthly basis according to different quotas (the unit of calculation is sometimes jiao and fen, and sometimes jin and liang), which are settled by the canteen at the end of the month. Losses are generally not compensated except in special circumstances; the saved meal tickets belong to the individual, and money is given for money, and grain is given for grain. This not only plans the canteen's grain consumption, but also conforms to the principle of eating well, eating enough, and saving, achieving satisfaction for the state, the commune, the canteen, and the commune members. The Practice of Planned Grain Consumption and Saving is Greatly Promoted

From the process of implementing the meal ticket system for more than two months, we have the following benefits.

1. On the premise of commune members eating enough and well, grain is saved, waste is eliminated, eating and then calculating is changed to calculating and then eating, and commune members can develop a habit of diligence and frugality. Since the implementation of the meal ticket system, commune members have taken the initiative to put forward reasonable suggestions such as "the days are short and the work is light in winter, so we should eat two meals and eat thinner." The canteens have generally changed to two meals according to the opinions of the masses, quickly reducing from an average of 1.2 jin to 1.3 jin of grain per person per day to 0.8 jin to 0.9 jin. The canteens of the eleventh and twelfth production teams in Xipu, with 720 people eating, saved 7,746 jin of grain in two months, and ate even better than before, often eating tofu and vermicelli.

2. The canteen can dispatch on its own within the supply quota, so as to plan grain consumption. In the past, most canteens ate fine grains instead of coarse grains, good grains instead of inferior grains, and thick porridge instead of thin porridge. After the implementation of the meal ticket system, the commune delegated the management authority of grain consumption to the canteen, and most canteens made annual plans for grain consumption based on the agricultural season. Based on the principle of using more during the busy season, using less during the slack season, eating thick porridge when the work is heavy, eating thin porridge when the work is light, and eating enough throughout the four seasons, it is stipulated that two meals should be eaten during the slack season and when the work is light, with an average of 0.9 jin or 1 jin of grain per person per day, and no less than 0.8 jin at the minimum; three meals should be eaten during the busy season and when the work is heavy, with an average of 1.1 jin or 1.2 jin of grain per person per day, and no more than 1.3 jin at the maximum. In order to ensure that people eat enough and well, produce well, are healthy, and save well, the Xipu canteen implements a combination of the administrator and the production team leader. The administrator determines what work the production team is doing, what food to eat, and how much rice to use.

3. Implementing the meal ticket system can eliminate the fuzzy understanding of the masses. In the past, commune members did not dare to reveal that they had grain at home, let alone cook it at home. Since the implementation of the meal ticket system, the saved meal tickets belong to the individual, and commune members have sold out the grain they have accumulated over the years. Wen Yonghe, a household in Xipu, sold more than 1,900 jin, and since the implementation of the meal ticket system, an average of more than 20 households in the entire village of 157 households do not go to the canteen to get food every day, and eat their own grain. The four villages of the original Jianming Commune can dig out 50,000 jin of grain stored over the years.

4. Implementing the meal ticket system and returning the savings to the individual conforms to the principle of large collective and small freedom. Because commune members save and eat, or eat their own old grain, the canteen can control a part of the mobile grain, which can be used to adjust some beans or sweet potatoes, make tofu, sprout soybeans, or make vermicelli, so that commune members can eat better. In addition, commune members, through saving, have some grain or change in their own hands. Sometimes, when the canteen food is not to their liking, they can make something that suits their taste, or buy something good to eat. This makes both the canteen and the commune members not feel "deadly stuck."

5. Saving grain can develop pig raising. Due to the implementation of the meal ticket system, saving grain, and tapping the potential of grain in the homes of commune members, the collective pig raising and commune member pig raising have been powerfully promoted. Each canteen plans to not only ensure self-sufficiency in meat throughout the year, but also to raise a batch of commodity pigs. The grain saved by commune members can also be used to raise pigs. For example, Qu Fuzhong and Wang Fengqi each added a pig after receiving the saved grain.

In short, the implementation of the meal ticket system, setting quotas based on people, and planning grain consumption are good methods to achieve eating enough, eating well, and saving, with both a large collective and small freedom, and everyone is satisfied. Therefore, it has been universally promoted and implemented in the thirteen communes in Zunhua County.

    以人定量办法好　吃饱吃好又省粮
    西铺建明公社公共食堂执行饭票制的体会
    中共遵化县委第一书记　　曹寿山
      “以人定量办法好，吃饱吃好又节约，有集体也有自由，社员干劲比天高。”这是河北遵化县西铺建明人民公社农村食堂执行饭票制以后，社员们的一首赞歌。现在西铺建明人民公社一百三十六个食堂，已普遍执行了饭票制，两个月来节约粮食达三十七万五千斤，以每人每年吃四百斤粮食计算，够九百三十七人吃一年。
        吃饭也要有个规矩
    西铺建明人民公社执行半供给制，实行了食堂吃饭不要钱，解除了人民历史上愁吃愁喝的永世之忧，社员不再为柴、米、油、盐……等而操心，可以一心一意的搞好生产，以便在更大的限度内改善人民生活。但是，实行吃饭不要钱后，有些社员则产生了误解：认为1958年丰收了，吃饭不需要节约；加上对食堂缺乏管理经验，没有建立必要的制度，不是算了吃，而是吃了算；少数年青人吃饭还搞竞赛，比多比快。因此，食堂做饭很难掌握，时而剩饭很多，时而不够吃，又得重做二回，闹得食堂和社员都不满意。为了解决这个问题，曾经采取限量办法。结果饭量大的不够吃，说什么既包吃就别怕大肚子汉；饭量小的按量打回去吃不了，剩下喂猪喂鸡，也有的晒成薯干，浪费很大。这种情况在一些贫农和老年社员看来，特别是原来“三条驴腿”办社的社员看来，很不满意。他们说：“这不是吃上干饭就忘了喝菜粥吗？古语说的好：省吃要在囤尖上，莫等无粮想有粮，丰年要当歉年过，遇着歉年不挨饿。”也有的说：“照这样连吃带糟蹋，再大的丰收也经不起。”对这个问题大部分社员都非常耽心，要求吃饭也应该有个规矩，有个制度。
    以人定量，节约归本人
    公社党委针对上述情况，立即召开了会议，按照群众的意见和要求，根据吃饱吃好又节约的原则，进行了细致的研究和讨论。最后决定在平均每人四百斤的指标内，按年龄大小实行以人定量包给食堂，执行饭票制。
    这个制度刚一提出来，也有些人不满意，认为吃饭受拘束；有的说一天节约一、二两粮食不顶事。为了统一干部和群众的思想认识，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，以“计划用粮好不好？”“浪费粮食对不对？”“怎样才能吃饱吃好又节约？”“还想不想保持勤俭办社勤俭办一切的荣誉”等为题，开展了鸣放辩论。同时算了一笔大账，一人一天节约一两粮食看来不算啥，全公社二万五千多人一年就能节约五十多万斤。推广到全县全国，这更是一个惊人的数字。通过回忆过去，摆事实讲道理，提高了思想，统一了认识。并按群众的意见，制定了具体办法：公社按平均每人四百斤的供应标准，统一包到食堂，由食堂掌握，自负盈亏。食堂按年龄大小，身体强弱，在每人平均四百斤的指标内划分七等，实行以人定量的饭票制。计：一岁全年九十斤，二岁至三岁一百五十六斤，四岁至八岁二百五十六斤，九岁至十二岁三百一十一斤，十三岁至十七岁三百八十六斤，十八岁以上四百八十斤，铁木工人五百四十斤。此外对劳力强饭量大的社员给予适当照顾。这样一来，食堂可以根据忙时多吃，闲时少吃，忙时闲时都吃饱的原则，统一掌握，按不同定量，逐月发给社员饭票（计算单位有的是角分，有的是斤、两），月终由食堂结算。亏者除特殊情况外一般不补；节约下的饭票归本人，要钱给钱，要粮给粮。这样作不仅食堂用粮有了计划，而且也符合吃饱吃好又节约的原则，达到了国家、公社、食堂、社员四满意。实行计划用粮，节约之风大兴
    从执行饭票制后，两个多月过程，我们体会有以下几点好处。
    1、在社员吃饱吃好的前提下，节约了粮食，杜绝了浪费现象，把吃了算，改变为算了吃，能养成社员勤俭节约的风尚。自从执行饭票制后，社员们主动提出：“冬天日短活轻，应该吃两顿饭，吃得稀一些”的合理化建议。食堂按群众的意见普遍改成两顿饭，很快从每人每天平均用粮一点二斤到一点三斤，降到零点八斤到零点九斤。西铺十一、十二两个生产队的食堂七百二十人吃饭，两个月就节省下粮食七千七百四十六斤，并且比先吃的还好，经常能吃上豆腐和粉条。
    2、食堂在不突破供应指标内，可以自行调度，作到有计划用粮。过去大部分食堂是有细不吃粗，有好不吃次，有稠不吃稀。执行饭票制以后，公社把粮食消费部分的管理权限下放到食堂，大部食堂都根据农事季节，作出全年计划用粮。本着农忙多用，农闲少用，活重吃稠，活轻吃稀，全年四季都吃饱的原则，规定闲时、活轻时吃两顿饭，平均每人每日用粮零点九斤或一斤，最少不能少于零点八斤；农忙活重吃三顿饭，平均每人每日用粮一点一斤或一点二斤，最多不超过一点三斤。为了保证作到吃饱吃好生产好、身体好、节约好，西铺食堂实行管理员和生产队长两结合，管理员根据生产队作什么活，吃什么饭，下多少米。
    3、实行饭票制可以解除群众的模糊认识。以前社员自家有粮也不敢露，更不愿自家做着吃。自从实行饭票制，节省下的饭票归本人，社员把几年积蓄下的粮食都卖了出来。西铺温永合一户就卖出一千九百多斤，全村一百五十七户自实行饭票制，平均每天有二十多户不去食堂打饭，吃自家的粮食。原建明社四个村就可挖出历年存粮五万斤。
    4、实行饭票制，节余归本人，符合大集体和小自由原则。因为社员节约着吃，或是吃自家的陈粮，能够使食堂掌握一部分机动粮食，可以调剂一些豆类或薯类，作豆腐生豆芽或粉条，让社员吃的更好。另外社员通过节约，自己掌握了一些粮食或零钱，有时食堂的饭不对口味时，可以自己做点顺口的，也可以买点好的吃，这样使食堂和社员都不感到“死巴”。
    5、节约下粮食可以发展养猪。由于实行饭票制，节约用粮和挖掘社员家中的粮食潜力，有力的推动了集体养猪和社员养猪。各食堂计划全年除保证肉食自给外，并要喂出一批商品猪来。社员节约下的粮食也可以用来养猪，如屈福忠、王凤起把节约的粮食领回来之后，各增添了一口猪。
    总之，执行饭票制，以人定量，计划用粮，是作到吃饱吃好又节约，既有大集体又有小自由，人人满意的好办法，所以在遵化县十三个公社内，已经普遍推广实行。
