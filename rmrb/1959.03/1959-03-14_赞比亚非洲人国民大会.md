    Zambia African National Congress

    The Zambia African National Congress is a nationalist organization in Northern Rhodesia with considerable influence among the masses. The Zambia African National Congress was formed at the beginning of this year from a split from the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress, and its chairman, Kaunda, was the former Secretary-General of the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress. Kaunda attended the All-African Peoples Conference held in Accra in December 1958.

    Since its establishment, the Zambia African National Congress has actively launched a movement against the "Central African Federation" and demanding independence. Recently, it has been particularly strongly opposed to the so-called "Legislative Council elections" to be held on March 20. Kaunda believes that this "election" is a mockery of democracy because it is a step taken according to the "constitutional reforms" in Northern Rhodesia announced by Britain in 1958. Britain is attempting to use this "election" as a guise to further consolidate its colonial rule in Northern Rhodesia. Therefore, this "election" violates the desire of the Africans in Northern Rhodesia for immediate independence. Not long ago, Zambia African National Congress Chairman Kaunda stated at a conference held in Matero near Lusaka: "No matter the consequences, we are prepared to pay the price for freedom." He also said that if the Zambia African National Congress is banned, it will go underground.

    赞比亚非洲人国民大会
    赞比亚非洲人国民大会是北罗得西亚的一个民族主义组织，在群众中有很大的影响。赞比亚非洲人国民大会是今年年初从北罗得西亚非洲人国民大会分离出来的，主席卡翁达就是北罗得西亚非洲人国民大会的前总书记。卡翁达曾经出席过1958年12月在阿克拉举行的全非人民大会。
    赞比亚非洲人国民大会从成立后就积极地展开反对“中非联邦”和要求独立的运动。最近它特别强烈反对即将在3月20日举行的所谓
  “立法议会选举”。卡翁达认为这个“选举”是对民主的嘲笑；因为它是根据1958年英国所宣布的北罗得西亚的“宪法改革”所采取的步骤，英国企图利用这个“选举”作为幌子来进一步巩固它在北罗得西亚的殖民统治。所以这个“选举”违反了北罗得西亚非洲人要求立即独立的愿望。不久前，赞比亚非洲人国民大会主席卡翁达在卢萨喀附近的马特罗举行的大会上曾表示过：“不管后果如何，我们准备付出争取自由的代价。”他还说，如果赞比亚非洲人国民大会被禁止活动，它将转入地下。
