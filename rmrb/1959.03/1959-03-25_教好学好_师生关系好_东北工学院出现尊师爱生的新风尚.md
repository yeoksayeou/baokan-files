Teaching Well, Learning Well, Good Teacher-Student Relationship
    New Atmosphere of Respect for Teachers and Love for Students Appears in Northeast Institute of Technology

    (Reported by our newspaper) Since the beginning of the new semester, a new atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving students, and teachers and students working together to improve teaching has emerged in the Northeast Institute of Technology.

    After the teachers and students of this institute participated in supporting local industry and production labor in conjunction with teaching and scientific research last year, they increased mutual understanding and established a new democratic and equal teacher-student relationship. Many students conduct scientific research and graduation design in factories and mines while engaging in production labor. Because they can receive timely help and guidance from teachers and obtain research results, they have a deeper understanding of the role of teachers in teaching. Teachers also feel that students are energetic, approachable, and amiable. Especially in the new semester, the adoption of the "three-way combination" method of lesson preparation, involving Party branches, teachers, and students, has made teachers realize that student participation in teaching activities can better improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, both teachers and students generally request that teachers and students cooperate closely to teach better and learn better. On this basis, the Party committee of the institute immediately launched an activity of "teaching well, learning well, and having good teacher-student relationships" and provided specific leadership, enabling teachers and students to improve together in the teaching process.

    Since the beginning of the new semester, many teachers have changed the past phenomenon of only managing teaching but not learning in the teaching process and have taken the initiative to play a leading role in teaching. After teaching a class, they often go deep into the student dormitories to understand the students' learning situation, help students solve difficulties in learning at any time, and solicit opinions on teaching. A good atmosphere of respecting teachers has also emerged among students. Each department and specialized class actively creates good teaching conditions for teachers. For example, some specialized classes in the Mining Department, in order to take care of the rest of the old teachers after class, prepare stools and hot water for the teachers to drink, showing close unity between teachers and students.

    The new relationship of teachers and students combining with each other and improving together is also manifested in the close cooperation in the teaching process. In order to give full play to the role of students in teaching, each department has generally established various teaching groups combining teachers and students. Some departments have also established teacher-student combination groups for each course to jointly discuss and study teaching content and teaching methods. At present, these teacher-student combination teaching groups have carried out various activities, and some have held teacher-student symposiums to formulate specific measures for "teaching well" and "learning well."

    Because teachers go deep among students and work with students to improve teaching, both "teaching" and "learning" have improved. For example, a teacher in charge of the Electrical Engineering course repeatedly wrote the lecture three times to prepare a lesson. However, after studying with the students, it was discovered that it had already been learned in physics. In this way, it took very little time to finish the lesson. At the same time, students can get guidance from teachers and understand teaching requirements at any time, which makes it easier to overcome learning difficulties and improve the quality of learning.

### 教好学好　师生关系好  东北工学院出现尊师爱生的新风尚

    教好学好　师生关系好
    东北工学院出现尊师爱生的新风尚
    本报讯　东北工学院的师生，在新的学期开学以来，出现了尊师爱生、师生结合共同搞好教学的新风尚。
    这个学院的师生，在去年结合教学、科学研究参加支援地方工业、生产劳动以后，增加了师生间的相互了解，建立起民主平等新的师生关系。许多学生在厂矿一面进行生产劳动，一面进行科学研究和毕业设计，由于能及时得到教师的帮助指导，获得研究成果，因而，对教师在教学中的作用体会更深。教师也感到学生朝气风发，可亲可近。尤其在新的学期中，采取由党支部、教师和学生参加的三结合备课方法，使教师体会到：学生参加教学活动，能够更好地提高教学质量。因此，教师和学生都普遍要求师生通力合作，教得更好、学得更好。在这基础上，学院党委立时开展教好、学好、师生关系好的活动，并加以具体领导，使教师和学生在教学过程中得到共同提高。
    在新的学期开学以来，许多教师在教学过程中改变了过去管教不管学的现象，主动发挥了教学中的主导作用。他们在教完课后，经常深入到学生宿舍，了解学生的学习情况，随时帮助学生解答学习上的疑难，并征求对教学的意见。在学生中，也出现尊敬教师的良好风尚。各系专业班都主动为教师创造良好的教课条件。如采矿系有些专业班，为照顾老教师的课后休息，给教师准备凳子，准备热水喝，表现了师生间亲密团结。
    教师和学生互相结合，共同提高的新关系，也表现在教学过程中的通力合作。各系为了能充分发挥学生在教学中的作用，普遍建立了各种师生结合的教学小组。有些系还根据每一门课，建立师生结合小组，共同讨论研究教学内容和教学方法。目前，这些师生结合的教学小组，已经开展了各种活动，有的召开了师生座谈会，制定了“教好”和“学好”的具体措施。
    由于教师深入到学生中去，并和学生共同搞好教学，在“教”和“学”方面就得到提高。如担任电工学课程的教师，曾为准备一节课反复写了三次讲稿。但经过与学生研究，才发现在物理学中已经学过。这样，就可以用很少时间讲完这节课。同时，学生能随时得到教师的指导与了解教学上的要求，也就容易克服学习上的困难，提高了学习质量。
