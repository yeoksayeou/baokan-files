Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

Shanghai workers, who have always been closely connected with the countryside, are now showing an even greater surge of activity in supporting the leap forward in agricultural production.

Tools and equipment needed for the current spring ploughing, sowing, and irrigation are being manufactured at an accelerated pace. Large items such as tractors and deep plows, and small items like wire nails and galvanized wire, as well as artificial rain machines for irrigating farmland and galvanized iron wire for screening seeds, are being rushed out in batches. The rotary deep tillage machine recently successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory has already been put into production and will be rushed out at a rate of two hundred units before mid-April. The Zhongguan, Dachang, and two other machinery factories just received a task to produce 450 water pumps for the countryside, and the workers are working intensely to prepare for production. These water pumps are all large-scale, with the largest capable of discharging 0.64 tons of water per second.

In order to supply the countryside with more pesticides for eliminating pests, a large-scale pesticide factory is under construction in Shanghai.

Shanghai commercial departments are further developing the large-scale purchasing and sales movement, actively organizing sources of agricultural production materials, and increasing supplies to the countryside. Relevant purchasing and supply stations are both assisting factories in purchasing raw materials, developing raw material conservation and substitution, and tapping production potential to increase output; and rapidly supplying the existing production materials in warehouses.

Workers on water and land transportation lines are expediting the transport of agricultural production materials to the countryside.

Scientific and technical workers in relevant scientific research institutions in Shanghai are also busy supporting the greater leap forward in agricultural production.

    上海工人为农业跃进忙
    据新华社讯　一向与农村息息相通的上海，现在又呈现出支援农业生产更大跃进的忙碌景象。
    当前春耕、播种和灌溉所需的工具和器材，正在加紧制造。大的如拖拉机、深耕犁，小的如元钉、铅丝，以及灌溉农田的人工降雨机，筛选种籽用的镀锌铁丝等，正在一批批地赶制出来。上海农业机械厂最近试制成功的旋转式深耕农作机，已经投入生产，在4月中旬以前将赶制出二百台。中冠、大昌等四家机器厂刚刚接到为农村突击生产四百五十台抽水机的任务，工人们就紧张地进行生产前的准备工作。这批抽水机都是大型的，其中最大的一种每秒钟可以出水零点六四吨。
    为了供应农村更多的除虫农药，一个规模巨大的农药厂正在上海兴建。
    上海商业部门进一步开展大购大销运动，积极组织农业生产资料货源，增加对农村的供应。有关的采购供应站一面协助工厂采购原材料，开展原料节约代用和挖掘生产潜力，增加产量；一面把仓库已有的生产资料迅速供应出去。
    水陆交通线上的工人们，正在尽速地把农业生产资料运往农村。
    上海有关的科学研究机构的科学技术工作者们，也都在为支援农业生产的更大跃进而忙碌。
