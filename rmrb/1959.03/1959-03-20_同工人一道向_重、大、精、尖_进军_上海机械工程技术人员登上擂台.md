Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 19th: More than two thousand engineering technicians from the Shanghai mechanical industry system held a rally on the 17th, vowing to leap forward. They presented their achievements in product design improvement and new product trial production this year, attained together with workers in the great technical revolution, to the conference as gifts, using physical objects and charts. They also expressed their intention to work with all industry employees this year to double the output value, trial-produce more than 400 new products, and further develop towards heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products.

Li Guangren, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Mechanical Industry, addressed the meeting. He said: Judging from the situation of vigorously launching mass movements and carrying out the great technical revolution last year, deeply mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and relying on the workers are the most fundamental aspects. However, the role of engineering technicians in the great technical revolution is also significant. He hoped that all industry engineering technicians would continue to exert their energy, rely on the workers, liberate their minds, and fully play the role of engineering technicians to make more contributions to this year's greater leap forward.

Li Gentong, chief engineer of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, on behalf of more than 140 engineering technicians of the factory, proposed an initiative to launch a friendly competition to all engineering technicians in the industry. He said: This year, the machine tool production of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory will increase by one time over last year. The factory will trial-produce twenty-eight kinds of high-efficiency, precision, cutting-edge, and large-scale machine tools. At present, the engineering technicians of the factory are working with the workers, and they are simultaneously designing nine kinds of machine tools. Since the beginning of this year, the engineering technicians of the factory have completed the design of two large new products, the cylindrical grinder and the roll grinder, under the joint efforts of the employees, which greatly shortened the design cycle. Many people at the meeting also talked about the benefits brought about by the implementation of the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers under the leadership of the Party Committee.

At the beginning of this year, the engineering technicians of various factories continued to implement the policy of "technology serving production, combining theory with practice, and combining technology with labor," going deep into the workshops and the masses, and actively put forward thousands of technical innovation measures.

Weng Jixun, an engineer from the Shanghai Auto Parts Manufacturing Factory, proposed a suggestion to fully automate the production of the factory's main product, radiators, which was warmly supported by the workers of the factory. At the meeting, he expressed that with the help of the workers, he would strive to complete the fully automatic water tank core assembly line for the main parts of the radiator before May 1st, so as to increase the output by two times. Liu Yutang, the chief of the technical section of the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory, introduced that the factory's engineering technicians are working with the workers to trial-produce a large nine-meter vertical lathe. They also simplified the design structure of the old products, and eliminated more than 130 parts on the lathe, which enabled each lathe to save more than 600 kilograms of steel.

Many engineering technicians cited facts to illustrate that as long as they believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and solve difficulties together with the workers, the technical innovation movement can be carried out quickly.

In order to further play the role of engineering technicians and implement the policy of combining technology and labor, more than half of the engineers in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory have been assigned to workshops to directly participate in the technical management of the workshops. The engineering technicians of the foundry workshop of this factory assured the conference that they would realize the mechanization of small castings production before May 1st. Engineering technicians from other factories also proposed to participate in labor regularly, continue to transform their thinking, strive to be both red and expert, and work with the workers to carry out the great technical revolution to realize a greater leap forward this year.

    同工人一道向“重、大、精、尖”进军
    上海机械工程技术人员登上擂台
    据新华社上海19日电  上海机械工业系统两千多名工程技术人员，17日举行集会，誓师跃进。他们用实物、图表把今年同工人一起大闹技术革命，改进产品设计、试制新产品所取得的成绩向大会献礼。并且表示今年要同全行业职工一道，完成产值翻一番的任务，试制四百多种新产品，进一步向重型、大型、精密、尖端产品的方向发展。
    上海市机械工业局局长李广仁在会上讲了话。他说：从去年大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命的情况来看，深入发动群众，依靠群众，依靠工人，这是最基本的方面。但是，工程技术人员在大闹技术革命中的作用，也是很大的。他希望全行业工程技术人员继续鼓足干劲，依靠工人，解放思想，充分发挥工程技术人员的作用，为今年更大跃进作出更多的贡献。
    上海机床厂总工程师李艮同代表全厂一百四十多个工程技术人员向全行业工程技术人员提出开展友谊竞赛的倡议。他说：今年上海机床厂的机床生产比去年增加一倍。全厂要试制二十八种高效率、精密、尖端、大型的机床。目前，全厂工程技术人员正在和工人一道，同时进行着九种机床的设计工作。今年以来，全厂工程技术人员已经在和职工们共同努力的情况下，完成了外圆磨床和轧辊磨床两种大型新产品的设计，大大缩短了设计周期。许多人在会上还畅谈了在党委领导下实行领导干部、技术人员、工人三结合所带来的好处。
    今年一开始，各工厂的工程技术人员继续贯彻了技术为生产服务，理论和实践结合、技术和劳动结合的方针，深入车间，深入群众，主动提出了成千上万条的技术革新措施。
    上海汽车配件制造厂工程师翁纪勋提出把厂里的主要产品——散热器生产全盘自动化的建议，受到全厂工人热烈支持。会上他表示要在工人的帮助下，争取在“五一”前，首先完成散热器的主要零件水箱芯子的全自动流水作业线，使产量提高二倍。上海重型机床厂的技术科长刘玉堂介绍了厂里的工程技术人员正在和工人一道，试制大型的九米立式车床的情况。他们还简化了老产品的设计结构，取消了车床上的一百三十多个零件，使每台车床能够节约六百多公斤钢铁。
    许多工程技术人员都举出事实说明，只要相信群众、依靠群众，有困难和工人一起解决，技术革新运动就能很快开展起来。
    为了进一步发挥工程技术人员的作用，贯彻技术和劳动相结合的方针，上海机床厂已经有半数以上的工程师下放到车间，直接参加车间的技术管理工作。这个工厂铸工车间的工程技术人员向大会保证，要在“五一”前实现小铸件生产机械化。其他工厂的工程技术人员也提出要定期参加劳动，继续改造思想，力求红透专深，同工人一起大闹技术革命，实现今年更大的跃进。
