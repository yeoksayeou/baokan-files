Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 18th: The "Al-Shaab" newspaper published an interview with Iraqi Foreign Minister Jawad on the 17th, stating: "The UAR is a country that planned the Mosul conspiracy from beginning to end."

The Foreign Minister, in an interview with a United Press International reporter, said: "The Iraqi government possesses evidence proving that the conspirators received truckloads of small arms, and the UAR also provided the conspirators with a set of broadcasting equipment. During the rebellion, the conspirators raised the UAR flag on military buildings in Mosul."

Jawad said that the UAR transported small arms, machine guns, rifles, and bombs via trucks through Syria. Some of these weapons were manufactured in Port Said.

Jawad also said that Iraq has obtained evidence proving that the three conspiracies against Kassem that have occurred in the past eight months can be entirely attributed to UAR President Nasser.

He said that Nasser is afraid of Iraq because Iraq wants to establish a democratic government that encourages trade unions and cultural development, which is contrary to Nasser's one-man rule. He also said that Nasser rules his country in a dictatorial manner.

    伊拉克外交部长发表谈话指出
    阿联是策划摩苏尔叛乱的一个国家
    过去三次反卡塞姆的阴谋可以完全归咎于纳赛尔
    新华社巴格达18日电　“国民报”17日发表的伊拉克外交部长贾瓦德的一篇谈话指出：“阿联是从始至终策划摩苏尔阴谋的一个国家。”
    这位外交部长在对合众国际社记者发表的这篇谈话中说：“伊拉克政府拥有证据证明阴谋分子得到成车的小型武器，阿联还给予阴谋分子一套广播设备。在叛变时，阴谋分子在摩苏尔的军事建筑物上升起了阿联的国旗。”
    贾瓦德说，阿联通过叙利亚用卡车运送了小型武器、机枪、步枪和炸弹，这些武器中，有些是在塞得港制造的。
    贾瓦德还说，伊拉克获得证据证明，过去八个月中发生的三次反对卡塞姆阴谋，可以完全归咎于阿联总统纳赛尔。
    他说，纳赛尔所以害怕伊拉克，是因为伊拉克要建立一个鼓励工会和文化发展的民主政府，这是同纳赛尔一人统治相抵触的。他还说，纳赛尔用独裁的方式统治着他的国家。
