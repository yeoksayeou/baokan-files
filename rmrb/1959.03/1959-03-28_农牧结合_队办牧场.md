    Combining Agriculture and Animal Husbandry: Team-Run Ranch
    (Our Dispatch) The Fourth Production Team of Yafuquan People's Commune in Shule County, southern Xinjiang, has established a ranch and implemented a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, specializing in animal husbandry, and has achieved good results.
    The development of animal husbandry in the agricultural areas of Xinjiang has been slow for a long time, mainly due to the lack of construction of feed bases, and also due to decentralized breeding, the reproduction rate is low. After communization in October last year, this production team concentrated the large livestock to organize a ranch, equipped with cadres, and carried out unified planning. Due to the adoption of advanced methods of grazing in separate groups, the introduction of fine livestock breeds, planned breed improvement work, and strengthened livestock epidemic prevention, therefore, from October last year to the present, no livestock have died.
    The method of developing animal husbandry by this production team is the direction for the development of animal husbandry in the agricultural areas of Xinjiang. Xinjiang has more than 22 million head of livestock, of which livestock in agricultural areas account for more than 70%. Due to decentralized feeding, it has failed to develop greatly. Taking the method of running ranches by production teams as a unit, specializing in animal husbandry, can reverse the slow development of animal husbandry in agricultural areas. The ranch implements a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, which can solve the feed problem; at the same time, livestock can provide a large amount of fertilizer for agricultural production.

    农牧结合  队办牧场
    本报讯　新疆南部蔬勒县雅甫泉人民公社第四生产大队建立了一个牧场，并实行农牧结合，专门经营畜牧业，获得了良好的成绩。
    新疆农业地区的畜牧业长期以来发展缓慢，主要是没有建设饲料基地，同时由于分散饲养，繁殖率低。去年10月间公社化以后，这个生产大队把大牲畜集中起来组织了牧场，配备了干部，进行了统一规划。由于采用分群放牧的先进方法，引进优良牲畜品种，有计划的进行品种改良工作，和加强牲畜防疫。因此，从去年10月到目前，牲畜没有死亡。
    这个生产大队发展畜牧业的办法是新疆农业区发展畜牧业的方向。新疆两千二百多万头牲畜，其中农业区牲畜占70％以上，由于分散喂养，未能得到大发展。采取以生产大队为单位办牧场，专门经营畜牧业的办法，就可扭转农业地区畜牧业发展缓慢的局面。牧场实行农牧结合，可以解决饲料问题；同时牲畜又可为农业生产提供大量肥料。
