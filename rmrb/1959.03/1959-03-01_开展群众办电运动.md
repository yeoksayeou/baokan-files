Launch a Mass Movement for Electricity Generation
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Last year, our country's electric power industry achieved unprecedented success in production and construction. The growth rate of both power generation and power equipment far exceeded the growth level of any previous year. Nevertheless, due to the ever-increasing demand for electricity from all sectors of the country's Great Leap Forward, the electric power industry must have a greater leap forward in order to meet the needs of all sectors.

To organize a greater leap forward in the electric power industry, in addition to continuing to vigorously develop large and modern electric power industries, a mass movement for electricity generation should also be launched. In this regard, the city of Lushun-Dalian in Liaoning Province provides a successful experience. Last year, Lushun-Dalian adopted the method of mass electricity generation, with the secretary taking the lead and the entire population participating, grasping steel production while simultaneously grasping electricity generation. In just four months, more than 4,000 various power stations and motive power stations were built, generating 140,000 kilowatts of electricity. As a result, the city exceeded its annual Great Leap Forward plan by 6.7% despite insufficient power supply in 1958, achieving significant results in ensuring industrial production.

This experience proves that mass electricity generation can not only appropriately meet the needs of production, but also is a long-term policy for electricity construction. Large and small, indigenous and foreign, are relative. They must be organically combined to play a role. "Small indigenous groups" are not only needed now, but will still be an indispensable mode of power supply for some regions, especially rural areas, in the future.

At present, many regions across the country have already begun to break away from the mystical view of electricity generation and have launched mass movements for electricity generation. However, some regions still have various mystical views on the manufacture of power equipment and motor equipment. This hurdle must be overcome in order for the mass electricity generation movement to be carried out smoothly.

There are two different methods for solving the manufacture of "small indigenous" power equipment. One is to passively wait and rely solely on the supply of manufacturing departments; the other is to be proactive, manufacture it ourselves, starting with indigenous methods and then adopting foreign methods, moving from indigenous to foreign. It is obvious which method can achieve immediate results. Liaoning Province adopted the latter method in carrying out the mass electricity generation movement. Many units that had never manufactured electromechanical equipment have already produced a considerable amount of power generating equipment and built many motive power stations and power stations.

In terms of the current situation, the development direction of "small indigenous groups" must be: adapting to local conditions, using local materials, fully exploiting the potential of various old and obsolete equipment, and rationally utilizing various motive power resources. In areas with relatively weak industrial foundations, various natural resources should be utilized in large quantities, focusing on small-scale projects, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, or first indigenous and then foreign methods, and taking a two-step development approach of first motive power and then electricity, to gradually consolidate and improve the results of mass electricity generation. In areas and cities with better industrial foundations, due to the large amount of electricity consumption and concentrated load, and because of better technical conditions and manufacturing capabilities, a combination of indigenous and foreign methods can be adopted, and gradually develop towards small and medium-sized modern groups, manufacturing a large number of small or medium-sized power generating equipment.

"Small indigenous groups" have broad development prospects in the comprehensive utilization of motive power resources. In this regard, not only should small-scale wind power, small-scale hydropower, and small-scale tidal power be widely utilized, but also waste resources such as industrial waste steam and coke oven gas should be widely utilized.

Recently, in a small number of regions and cities with better industrial foundations, a trend of unified planning, collaborative production, organization of complete equipment manufacturing, and construction of joint power stations has begun to emerge. From small to large, from indigenous to foreign, from individual work to collaboration, this is an inevitable development process. Using this communist large-scale collaboration method to carry out the mass electricity generation movement can smoothly solve a series of problems such as funds, materials, equipment, technology, and labor force in electricity generation, and can truly achieve learning from each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses, and each doing their best, which is worth promoting.

Overall, with the continuous leap forward of various sectors of the national economy, the demand for electricity in the future will inevitably be greater and greater. Therefore, while organizing and arranging the construction of "large modern" power stations, continuing to carry out the mass electricity generation movement of "small indigenous groups" is of great significance for ensuring the comprehensive leap forward of our country's industrial production. Of course, the mass electricity generation in a region must also have unified arrangements and planning, so that human, material and financial resources can be rationally utilized to meet the needs of all parties.

    开展群众办电运动
    本报评论员
    去年，我国电力工业的生产和建设，获得了空前的成就。发电量和发电设备的增长速度，都远远地超过了以往任何一年的增长水平。虽然如此，但是，由于全国各方面的大跃进对电力的需要日益增长，电力工业必须有更大的跃进，才能适应各方面的需要。
    组织电力工业的更大跃进，除了继续大力发展大洋群的电力工业以外，还应当开展一个群众性的办电运动。在这方面，辽宁省旅大市就提供了一项成功的经验。去年旅大市采用了群众办电的方法，书记挂帅，全民动手，抓钢同时抓电，在短短的四个月里，建成了各种电力站和动力站四千余座，办电十四万瓩，因此，该市在1958年电力供应不足的情况下，超额6.7％完成了全年跃进计划，在保证工业生产方面，获得了显著的效果。
    这个经验证明，群众办电不仅能适当满足生产的需要，而且这是电力建设的一个长远方针。大与小、土与洋都是相对的。必须有机地结合起来发挥作用。“小土群”不仅现在需要，就是将来，仍是一些地区特别是农村必不可少的一种供电方式。
    现在，全国许多地区已经开始打破了办电神秘的观点，开展了群众性的办电运动。但是，还有一些地区对于动力设备和电机设备的制造还有着各种神秘观点。必须突破这一关，才能使群众办电运动顺利开展。
    解决“小土”电力设备的制造，有两种不同的方法。一种是消极等待，单纯依靠制造部门供应；另一种是积极主动，自己动手制造，先土后洋，由土到洋。采取哪一种方法可以立见功效是显而易见的。辽宁省在开展群众办电运动中，就是采取了后一种方法。许多没有制造过机电设备的单位，都已经造出了不少的发电设备，建成了不少的动力站和发电站。
    就当前情况来看，“小土群”的发展方向必须是：因地制宜，就地取材，充分发挥各种残旧设备的潜力，合理地利用各种动力资源。在工业基础比较薄弱的地区，应该大量利用各种天然资源，以小型为主，采取土洋结合或者先土后洋、先动力后电力分两步走的发展方式，来逐步巩固和提高群众办电的成果。在工业基础较好的地区和城市，由于用电量大，负荷集中，并且由于技术条件和制造能力较好，因此可以采用土洋结合方法，并逐渐向小、中洋群的方向发展，大量制造小型或者中型的发电设备。
    在发展动力资源的综合利用方面“小土群”有广泛的发展前途的。在这方面，不仅小型风力、小型水力和小型潮力应当加以广泛利用，特别是对工业废汽、焦炉煤气等废弃资源，也都应当加以广泛利用。
    最近以来，在少数工业基础较好的地区和城市，已经开始出现统一规划、协作生产、组织成套设备制造、兴建联合电站的趋势。由小到大，由土到洋，由单干到协作，这是一个必然的发展过程。用这种共产主义大协作方式开展群众办电运动，就能够顺利地解决办电中的资金、材料、设备、技术和劳动力等一系列问题，就能够真正地做到取长补短，各尽所能，这是值得提倡的。
    总起来说，随着国民经济各部门的不断跃进，今后对电力的需要必然是越来越大，因此，在组织和安排“大洋”电站建设的同时，继续开展“小土群”的群众办电运动，对于保证我国工业生产的全面跃进是有非常重要意义的。当然，一个地区的群众办电，也必须要有统一的安排和规划，这样才能合理利用人力、物力、财力，适应各方面的需要。
