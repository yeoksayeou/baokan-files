    The Pearl River Boat Dwellers Come Ashore
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Xinxian
    Recently, the boat-dwelling people of Guangzhou have successively moved to settle on land. The small boats that used to be lined up along the banks of the Pearl River as "homes" for boat dwellers are decreasing day by day.

    For many years, the boat people have longed to settle on land. They once used the lines "Generations of water as home, years of boats as houses; floating in the waves, living at the edge of the sea" to reflect their centuries-old drifting life and their desire to change this kind of life. However, under the traditional discrimination against boat people in the old society, this reasonable desire was just a fantasy for generations and could never become a reality. In the old society, the ruling class stipulated that they were not allowed to intermarry with people on land, were not allowed to do business on land, and were even less allowed to settle on land. In the Fangcun area, there is a tragic story: A boat-dwelling couple, because their two children had successively fallen into the river and drowned, took their remaining daughter, who was about fifteen or sixteen years old, and a child under one year old to the land. They secretly built a thatched hut by a remote riverbank, wanting to live there. This was discovered by a local tyrant, who immediately forced them to pay three years' rent within three days, otherwise they would have to give their daughter as compensation. When the couple was forced to prepare to move elsewhere, they were discovered by the tyrant again. The tyrant's henchmen beat the couple unconscious, threw their child under one year old into the river, and snatched their daughter away. When the couple woke up and found that their beloved children were gone, they committed suicide by drowning themselves.

    However, the miserable life of boat dwellers in the old society has vanished forever. Now, new fishermen's villages, new boatmen's villages, new residents' villages and residents' dormitories have been built along the Pearl River in Liwan, Ersha Island, Kejia, Donglang and other places, providing comfortable housing for the boat people. Many boat people have also moved to residential areas on land streets and employee dormitory areas. In Shamian, a "concession" area that was once occupied by imperialists, some boat people have now moved in. Before liberation, some boat women who had rowed small boats on the Shamian riverbank for a lifetime never dared to go ashore to take a look. Most of the boat people who moved to Shamian are family members of railway workers. Because they have always lived on the water and used boats as their homes, they have no bed boards, mosquito nets, or tables and chairs. The railway trade union took care of their difficulties and helped them buy bed boards and mosquito nets. Some neighbors, fearing that they would not be accustomed to life on land, also enthusiastically helped them with household chores.

    In the Ersha Island Fishermen's New Village, there are six rows of neat bungalows. Each house has a living room and a bedroom, or a living room and two small bedrooms, with a kitchen and bathroom. The owners of these houses wipe the floors and glass windows so that they are sparkling clean, and many families also hang portraits of Chairman Mao on the white walls. Around the residential area, there are supply and marketing cooperatives, canteens, nurseries, as well as fishing boat repair factories, hemp rope factories, and fishing gear processing plants. Many male and female fishermen are busy weaving hemp ropes and repairing fishing boat tools in the factories, showing a scene of joy everywhere.

    The Liwan Boat Dwellers' Dormitory is built next to Liwan Park. In the middle of the two rows of three-story buildings, there is also a flower garden. Each floor here has a kitchen, bathroom and toilet. When the reporter came here to visit, an old lady warmly greeted me into her home. The old lady excitedly told me that she now lives with her son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren. In the past, her family was separated in three places: she took two older grandchildren to ferry on the Huangsha River, her daughter-in-law rowed a "foreign board" in Liwan, and her son worked at another pier. The life of family reunion now makes the old lady feel infinite happiness.

    The relocation of boat dwellers to land not only stabilizes their residence, but also facilitates their participation in the country's various production and construction undertakings. Now, many of these boat people have joined state-owned factories and enterprises, and more women have joined production in factories run by street offices. As for the various fishermen's new villages and street-run factories and workshops, there are even more. Boat dwellers who moved to the land who did not participate in production in the past are now all employed.

    珠江水上人家上岸来
    新华社记者　陈信贤
    近来，广州市的水上人家相继迁移到陆上定居，过去排列在珠江岸边作为水上居民“住宅”的小艇，正在一天天地减少。
    多少年来就盼望到陆地定居的水上人民，曾经用“世世水为乡，年年艇作家；浮沉波浪里，生活海天涯。”的诗句，反映他们千百年漂流生活的情景和要求改变这种生活的愿望。可是，在旧社会对水上人民的传统歧视下，他们这个合理的愿望只是世世代代的幻想，永远不能变成现实。在旧社会里，统治阶级曾经规定过：不准和陆上人家通婚，不准在陆上做买卖，更不用说到陆上定居的事了。在芳村一带流传着这样一段凄惨的故事：一对水上人家夫妻，因为两个孩子先后掉进江里淹死了，他们就带着剩下的一个十五、六岁的女儿和一个未满周岁的孩子迁到陆上，偷偷地在一处偏僻的河边搭了一间茅屋，想在那里住下来。这事被当地一个恶霸发现了，立即强迫他们在三天内交足三年地租，否则便要他们把女儿作抵偿。这对夫妻被迫准备迁到别处去的时候，又被恶霸发觉，恶霸的爪牙把这对夫妻打晕了后，把他们未满周岁的孩子抛到江里去，并把女儿抢走。这对夫妇醒来发现他们心爱的孩子都没有了，便双双投水自尽。
    可是，水上居民在旧社会里的凄惨生活，已经永逝不返了。现在，珠江沿岸荔湾、二沙头、科甲、东朗等地，都建起了渔民新村、船民新村、居民新村和居民宿舍，给水上人民安排下舒适的住宅。还有许多水上人家搬到了陆上街道住宅区和职工宿舍区。在沙面，这个从前曾是帝国主义霸占的“租界”区里，现在也搬进了一些水上人家。而在解放前，有的水上妇女虽在沙面江边划了一辈子小艇，却从未敢上岸看看。迁居沙面的水上人家多是铁路职工家属，由于他们一向住在水上，以艇为家，没有床板、蚊帐，也没有桌椅。铁路工会照顾他们的困难，帮助他们买了床板、蚊帐。有的邻居怕他们不习惯陆上生活，还热情地帮助他们料理家务。
    在二沙头渔民新村里，坐落着六排整齐的平房。每座屋内都有一厅一房，或者一厅两小房，有厨房、浴室。这些房屋的主人把地板、玻璃窗擦得亮晶晶的，许多人家还在粉白的墙壁上挂着毛主席像。住宅周围有供销社、食堂、托儿所，还有渔船维修厂、麻缆厂、鱼具加工场等。许多男女渔民在场里忙着编麻缆、修补渔船工具，到处呈现着一片欢乐景象。
    荔湾水上居民宿舍建在荔湾公园旁边，在两排并列着的三层楼房中间，还有一片花圃。这里每一层楼都有厨房、浴室和厕所。当记者到这里来访问的时候，被一位老大娘热情地招呼到她家里去。这位老大娘兴奋地告诉我说，她现在和儿子、媳妇、孙儿们都住在一起了，而在过去，她们一家人却分在三处：她带着两个大一点的孙儿在黄沙河上摆渡，媳妇在荔湾里划“洋板”，儿子又在另一处码头干活。现在一家团聚的生活，使老大娘感到无限的幸福。
    水上居民移居陆上，不仅使他们居住安定，而且也便于他们参加国家的各项生产建设事业，现在，这些水上人民中有许多已经参加了国营工厂、企业工作，更多的妇女则到街道办的工厂里参加生产。至于各个渔民新村、街道民办的工厂、工场，那就更多了。迁到陆上的水上居民，过去没有参加生产的，现在已经全部就业。
