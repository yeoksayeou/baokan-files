    Layered Contracting, Everyone Responsible
    Mass Enthusiasm Fully Unleashed After Guangdong's Rectification of Communes
    (Reported by our newspaper) In the process of rectifying and consolidating communes, the 759 People's Communes in Guangdong Province have, based on the principle of combining conscious labor with universal responsibility, initially established a layered production responsibility system suited to the nature of the People's Communes. This has further motivated commune members' enthusiasm for labor and improved labor efficiency.
    In the process of promoting the production responsibility system, People's Communes in various regions have fully mobilized commune members to conduct discussions and debates, unifying their ideological understanding and establishing the production responsibility system on the foundation of conscious labor. In these debates, most commune members believed that clear division of labor, specialized personnel for tasks, and designated management for materials not only facilitated the implementation and execution of the commune's production plans but also helped to unleash commune members' enthusiasm for production and improve labor efficiency. In addition, after these debates, the communes also recognized that implementing quota management still had significant positive effects: first, it could serve as a basis for leaders to formulate production plans, labor plans, and production task assignments; second, it could serve as a basis for assessing commune members' work attitude, strengthening their sense of responsibility; and third, it facilitated labor competitions between teams and individuals.
    Currently, People's Communes in Guangdong Province have implemented a layered contracting production responsibility system. Communes generally implement a "four-guarantee" system for management districts (包产量, 包投资, 包措施, 包上调产品): guaranteeing output, guaranteeing investment, guaranteeing measures, and guaranteeing the products to be turned over to the state. When production teams organize labor for production separately, they implement a "six-determination" system within a certain period (定领导, 定人员, 定工地, 定任务, 定质量, 定时间): fixed leadership, fixed personnel, fixed worksite, fixed task, fixed quality, and fixed time. Based on this, they implement rewards for exceeding quotas and conduct labor competitions. Production teams arrange and contract to complete various agricultural tasks according to the commune's unified plan. For tasks requiring group or individual operation, the communes also adopt a method of "fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed quality" to contract production responsibility to groups or individuals. At the same time, based on the wage levels determined according to each commune member's physical strength, skills, and work attitude, they implement a method of calculating wages based on actual workdays and democratically assess rewards and penalties based on the quantity and quality of work actually completed. In order to combine the collective responsibility system with the individual responsibility system, communes throughout the province have now universally implemented quota management, implementing production responsibility down to the individual. In addition, they have established attendance and evaluation reward systems, combining political and ideological education for commune members with the distribution of bonus wages and adjustments to wage levels, achieving "setting attendance based on the individual, rewarding those who exceed attendance, and penalizing those who are absent." The specific practices of quota management are generally: taking the amount and quality of work that a medium-strength laborer can complete in one day for various agricultural tasks as a quota unit, and then, according to the commune member's wage level, stipulating the quota tasks that laborers at each level should complete each month. At the end of the month, calculations are made, and those who exceed the quota are marked with a red dot. Most communes use quota management as a basis for assessing commune members' work attitude and distributing bonus wages. According to statistics from 106 communes in the Hainan District, 85% of the communes have implemented the "six-determination" management system, 83% have implemented quota responsibility systems for various agricultural tasks, and attendance, inspection, acceptance, and evaluation reward systems have been established, with attendance books or cards set up by work group for regular evaluations and rewards.
    Having absorbed some good experiences in labor management from the original agricultural cooperatives, and having initially established a production responsibility system adapted to the nature of the communes, the People's Communes throughout the province have not only established normal production order but also ensured that everyone has something to do and everything is taken care of. Production teams, specialized teams, and even individual commune members have clear responsibilities, know what is expected of them, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved, with labor quotas constantly being broken. In Jiangcheng Commune in Liangyang County (formerly Yangjiang and Yangchun Counties), labor efficiency in all aspects of production, including water conservancy, deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline occupations, has increased across the board by one to several times after the establishment of the responsibility system. After rationally allocating labor, organizing specialized teams, and promoting the production responsibility system, Nada Commune in Danxian County increased deep plowing from 0.03 mu per person per day to 0.15 mu; ditch digging from 60 feet per person per day to 100 feet; green manure accumulation from 1,000 jin per person per day to 2,000 jin; and the efficiency of tasks such as seed selection and sowing also increased exponentially. After the Shuitang Management District of Xieji Commune in Gaozhou County implemented quota management, the commune members' sense of responsibility for labor was greatly strengthened. Of the 56 commune members in Qingsan Village of this management district who attended work, 40 were marked with red dots for exceeding the labor quota in five consecutive days of labor, and only one failed to meet the quota. The entire management district was filled with a joyful and actively laboring atmosphere. Commune members wrote big-character posters and sang: "Implementing quotas is no small matter, commune members' enthusiasm soars, everyone is active and no one is lazy, in the blink of an eye fertilizer piles up like mountains." "Conscious labor is different from before, swift as a rocket, everyone implements quotas, and everyone who exceeds the quota is marked with a red dot."

    分层包干  人人负责
    广东整社后群众积极性充分发挥
    本报讯　广东省七百五十九个人民公社在整顿巩固公社工作中，根据自觉劳动和人人有责相结合的原则，大部分公社已经初步建立了与人民公社性质相适应的层层包干生产责任制，进一步调动社员劳动积极性，提高了劳动效率。
    各地人民公社在推行生产责任制的过程中，都充分发动社员群众开展鸣放辩论，统一思想认识，把生产责任制建立在群众自觉劳动的基础上。在辩论中，大多数社员认为，分工明确，事有专人，物有专管，这不仅便于贯彻和执行公社的生产计划，同时有利于发挥社员的生产积极性，提高劳动效率。另外，各公社在经过辩论以后，也认为实行定额管理仍然有很大的积极作用：一，可以作为领导上制订生产计划、劳动计划和分配生产任务的依据；二，作为考核社员劳动态度好坏的依据，加强社员的责任心；三，便于队与队、人与人之间开展劳动竞赛。
    广东省各人民公社目前已推行层层包干生产责任制。公社对管理区、管理区对生产队一般是实行包产量、包投资、包措施、包上调产品的“四包”制度；生产队在分别组织劳动力进行生产时，在一定时间内实行定领导、定人员、定工地、定任务、定质量、定时间的“六定”制度，并在这基础上实行超额奖励和开展劳动竞赛。生产队根据公社的统一计划来安排和包干完成各项农活，其中一些需要小组或个人操作的工作，各公社还采取“定时间、定数量、定质量”的办法，把生产责任包到小组或个人。同时，在根据每个社员的体力、技术、劳动态度所评定的工资等级的基础上，实行按实际工作日计算工资的办法，并根据每人实际完成的工作数量和质量，由群众进行民主评定奖罚。为了将集体的责任制和个人的责任制结合起来，全省各公社现在普遍推行了定额管理，把生产责任贯彻到个人；另外，还建立了考勤、评比奖励制度，把对社员的政治思想教育和发放奖励工资、调整工资级别结合起来，做到“按人定勤、超勤奖励、缺勤处罚”。定额管理的具体做法一般是：以一个中等劳动力在各项农活中一天所能完成的工作数量和质量为一个定额单位，再根据社员的工资级别，规定各级劳动力每月应完成的定额任务，月终核算，超额的记上红点；大多数公社都把定额管理作为考核社员劳动态度的好坏和发放奖励工资的依据。根据海南区一百零六个公社的统计，目前已实行“六定”管理制度的公社占85％，各项农活已实行定额责任制的占83％，并且建立了考勤、检查、验收、评比奖励制度，以作业组为单位设立考勤簿或卡片，定期评比，实行奖励。
    全省各地的人民公社在吸收了原来农业社在劳动管理上一些好的经验，初步建立了与公社的性质相适应的生产责任制之后，不仅建立了正常的生产秩序，而且做到人人有事干，事事有人管，生产队、专业队、以至社员责任明确，心中有数，劳动效率大大提高，劳动定额不断被突破。两阳县（原阳江、阳春县）江成公社无论在水利、深翻、积肥、副业等各方面的生产，在建立责任制后，劳动效率全面增长一倍到几倍。儋县那大公社在合理安排劳动力、组织专业队和推行生产责任制后，深翻从每人每天完成三厘地增加到一分半；挖水沟从每人每天六十尺增加到一百尺；积绿肥从每人每天一千斤增加到二千斤；选种、播种等工作效率也成倍地提高。高州县谢鸡公社帅堂管理区实行定额管理后，社员们劳动责任心大大加强。这个管理区的清散村出勤生产的五十六名社员，在连续五天劳动生产中，超过劳动定额被记上红点的便有四十人，完不成定额的只有一人。全管理区出现一片愉快、积极劳动的气氛。社员们写大字报唱道：“实行定额不等闲，社员干劲冲崩山，个个积极无人懒，转眼肥料堆成山。”“自觉劳动不同前，快步如飞似火箭，人人定额都实行，大家超额记红点。”
