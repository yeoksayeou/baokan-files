The Hunter's Cloth Ration Coupons
Dawoer Nationality Batu Baoyin

Early in the morning, the hunter Tuokechun led out his white steed, traversed the forest and grasslands, and galloped to the department store of the Banner Commercial Bureau. The department store was packed with people, and there was plenty of merchandise. He looked around, wanting to buy everything. White flour, fine cloth, candy, liquor, New Year pictures, firecrackers, fruit... he bought a large pile, big bags and small packages. Just as he stepped out the door, he saw a group of hunters from his tribe sitting on the ground drinking. Recognizing them all as friends, he hurried over to greet them, and they quickly urged him to join them for a drink. When good friends meet, everything is done heartily. Tuokechun sat down and drank and chatted to his heart's content.

They reminisced about the miserable life under the puppet Manchukuo regime. Back then, the Japanese were utterly brutal, killing an Oroqen like killing a wild beast. Relatives who were dragged off to do hard labor couldn't return home for a whole year, let alone reunite for the Spring Festival. All that could be heard were the gunshots of the Japanese devils and their lackeys, the wails of the hunters, and all that could be seen were the ugly faces of the Japanese and their lackeys and the worried faces of the hunters. Now, wherever you go, there is a scene of joy. How lively the Spring Festival is now! The banks of the Nuomin River resonate with songs, laughter, and the sound of firecrackers... The more they chatted, the happier they became, and they emptied one liquor container after another. As the saying goes, "A thousand cups are too few when drinking with kindred spirits." Tuokechun still felt he hadn't had enough, but he was drunk. He staggered onto his horse and cheerfully galloped back to the tribe.

In the evening, Tuokechun was overjoyed because his son was graduating from the Central University for Nationalities and returning to work, and also marrying a daughter-in-law. He was delighted to be celebrating a double blessing during the Spring Festival. However, his wife, with a stern face, said, "You old fool, you only cared about buying New Year's goods and forgot to buy the flowered fabric for the new quilt for your daughter-in-law!" Only then did Tuokechun remember that he had forgotten to buy the quilt cover at the department store today. "I'll go buy it tomorrow!" he thought as he felt in the pocket of his roe-deer skin coat. Suddenly, he was dumbfounded. Ah! Where had the three cloth ration coupons gone? His wife, seeing that he was silent, urged him, "When are you going to buy it?" He pretended to be calm and said, "Tomorrow, I'll go tomorrow."

The next day, Tuokechun again rode his white steed to the department store. He lowered his head, searching for the cloth ration coupons. He couldn't find them on the left, he couldn't find them on the right. He was so anxious that he scratched his head, not knowing what to do. "Grandpa, what are you looking for?" A crisp voice came from behind. He turned around and saw a little girl with a red scarf around her neck.

"I, I'm looking for cloth ration coupons," he said, lowering his head again to search.

"How many?" the little girl asked again.

"Three, have you seen them?"

Without answering, the little girl took the old man's hand and walked towards the compound of the Banner People's Committee. Arriving at the gate of the Banner People's Committee, the little girl pointed to the notice board in front of the gate and read aloud, "Our People's Committee's car driver found three cloth ration coupons. We hope the fellow villager who lost the cloth ration coupons will come to the office to claim them."

The little girl then pulled the old man's hand and ran to the office to claim the cloth ration coupons. Tuokechun retrieved his cloth ration coupons, bought the flowered fabric, and returned to the tribe. The old man felt a surge of warmth in his heart and told everyone he met, "In the past, we were afraid of government offices and couldn't avoid them fast enough. Now, the government people pick up cloth ration coupons and even write a notice to find the owner. The cadres also treat me kindly. The Han, Mongol, and Oroqen people are united as one, without a single crack. The world has truly changed! That little girl wearing the red scarf is a child from a hunter's family. She studies so well..."

On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, warm sunlight streamed through the sparkling glass windows, shining on the freshly painted walls, making them glitter. The walls were covered with various colorful New Year pictures. Tuokechun's daughter, helping her mother, happily sewed a new quilt on the kang, humming a newly composed folk song as she sewed:

	"Welcoming the New Spring arrives at the door,
	Receiving the new bride arrives at home,
	The sun shines brightly on the doors and windows,
	The gentle breeze warms our home village...." (Attached image)

    猎人的布票
    达斡尔族　巴图宝音
    大清早，猎人托克春牵出了白骏马，穿过了森林草滩，快马加鞭地来到了旗商业局百货门市部。门市部里挤满了人。货色可不少。他东瞅西看，见啥都想买。白面、细布、糖果、白酒、年画、炸炮、水果……大一袋小一包地买了一大堆。刚走出大门，见着部落里一伙猎人在那里坐在地上喝酒，一看都是相识的朋友，他就忙上前打招呼，大伙赶紧拦住请他喝酒。知心朋友见面，干啥都来得痛快，托克春就坐在那里，痛痛快快地喝呀痛痛快快地唠。
    他们唠起伪满时的悲惨生活，那时日本人干啥都很野，枪杀一个鄂伦春就像枪杀一个野兽那样简单，那时被拉去做苦工的亲人一年到头回不了一趟家，更谈不上春节团聚。那时候到处听到的是鬼子狗腿子的枪声，猎民的嚎哭声，到处看到的是鬼子和狗腿子的丑脸和猎民们的愁眉苦脸。如今，不论走到哪里，都是一片欢乐景象，现在的春节多热闹啊！诺敏河畔响彻着歌声、欢笑声、炸炮声……。他们越唠越高兴，酒棒子一个一个被他们喝空喝干。不知不觉喝到唠到太阳偏西。俗语说：“酒逢知己千杯少”，托克春还觉得没有喝够，但是他醉了。他摇摇晃晃地跨上马，兴高彩烈地奔回部落。
    晚间，托克春因为儿子从中央民族学院毕业回来参加工作，又娶儿媳妇，正为过个双喜临门的春节而感到非常高兴的时候，老伴却在一边板着脸说：“你这老糊涂，你咋只顾办年货，连给儿媳妇做新被的花被面也忘了买呢？”托克春这才想起今天上门市部忘了买被面。“赶明儿个再去买吧！”他边想边摸狍皮大衣口袋。忽然，他变得目瞪口呆，呵！三张布票咋没有了？老伴见他不作声，催问了一句：“啥时候再去买呵？”他假装镇静地说：“明天就去，明天就去。”
    第二天，托克春又骑着白骏马来到了百货门市部院里。低着头找布票，左找不见，右找没有，急得他搔头挠耳，不知咋办好。“老大爷，您找啥呀？”后面传来了清脆的问话声。他回头一看，见是一个脖子上系着红领巾的小姑娘。
  “我，我找布票。”说着，他又低下头四处找寻。
    “几张？”小姑娘又问。
      “三张，你见到吗？”
    小姑娘也不答话，拉着老大爷的手，就往旗人委的院里走，到了旗人委门前，小姑娘指着门前的揭示板念道：“我人委汽车司机拾到三张布票，希丢了布票的老乡快来办公室领取。”
    小姑娘又拉着老大爷的手，跑到办公室去认领布票。托克春领回了布票，买好了花被面，回到了部落里。老大爷心里一阵热呼，见人就说：“从前见了衙门就害怕，躲还躲不及，如今，政府的人捡了布票，还写布告招领，干部还亲切招待我，汉人、蒙古人、鄂伦春人团结得一条缝也没有，真是世道大变啦！那个戴着红领巾的小丫头，是我们猎民家的孩子，学得多好呀……”
    大年三十的响午，温暖的阳光透过亮晶晶的玻璃窗照进来，照得粉刷一新的墙面闪闪发光。墙上贴满了各种彩色年画。托克春的闺女帮着母亲，在炕上欢欢乐乐缝新被，边缝边哼着新近编的民歌：
      “迎新春到门上来，
    接新娘到家里来，
    太阳照亮了门窗，
    和风吹暖了家乡。……”（附图片）
