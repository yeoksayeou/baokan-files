A Commentary by Xinhua News Agency Reporter
During Tito's recent visits to some Asian and African countries in recent months, Yugoslav revisionists have been particularly energetic in portraying themselves as warriors who "support national independence" and "defend peace." However, people are not only "listening to their words" but, more importantly, "observing their actions." Leaving aside the more distant past, let's take the example of Yugoslavia's commentary on the Cyprus agreement recently signed in London by three NATO member states (Britain, Greece, and Turkey). The "Borba" newspaper, the mouthpiece of the Tito clique, provided a very detailed assessment of the Anglo-Greek-Turkish London agreement. On February 24, "Borba" published a special commentary stating: "The London agreement is a positive fact compared to the current situation, and it opens up prospects for a final resolution of the Cyprus issue." This newspaper went to great lengths to try to convince the people of Cyprus that "this agreement gives them the possibility of peace, improved life, and deciding their own destiny."

The communiqué issued by Tito and Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis on March 3 also clearly stated that they discussed the London agreement and believed that "the people of Cyprus have gained independence through this agreement."

But what is the truth of the matter? Although the London agreement nominally stipulates that Cyprus become an "independent republic," in reality, Britain continues to possess absolute sovereignty over its military bases there. The agreement also stipulates that Cyprus must conclude a military alliance with Greece and Turkey, which will station troops in Cyprus. The three countries, Britain, Greece, and Turkey, reserve full rights to interfere in Cypriot affairs, and they have even predetermined every key point of Cyprus's future constitution in the agreement. It is clear that the London agreement is nothing more than a form of collective colonialism imposed on Cyprus by the three countries, maintaining Britain's unsustainable rule there, turning Cyprus into a colony and military base jointly managed by the three NATO member states, Britain, Greece, and Turkey, and enabling the United States to further strengthen the southern flank of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. "The Times of India" pointed out that the London agreement is "obviously imposed on the people of Cyprus" and is "extremely unfavorable to the people of Cyprus." The "Hindustan Times" and other newspapers also believe that the London agreement is a chain that hinders Cyprus's independence. Even Lebanon's "Al-Yom" newspaper believes that Britain is the "victor" of the London agreement because it allows Britain to retain military bases and "do as it pleases."

Tito's communiqué on the talks in Greece and "Borba's" commentary on the London agreement have thus completely torn off the Tito clique's mask of "anti-colonialism," exposing what the Tito clique's idea of "deciding their own destiny" really is!

The "Borba" commentary also went to great lengths to urge the people of Cyprus to "peacefully" accept the London agreement, saying that "the most direct expectation of this agreement is linked to peace, and peace should spread throughout Cyprus's happy olive groves." It turns out that the "peace" advocated by the Tito clique is the "peace" of oppressed people submitting to imperialist rule without resistance.

It is not difficult to understand why the Tito clique was so eager to speak out on the London agreement issue without bothering to disguise itself. Immediately after the London agreement was signed, the U.S. State Department, which was behind the scenes of this agreement, immediately issued a statement expressing its welcome. Obviously, since the master has praised it, how dare the lackey not support it! The "Borba" commentary, in praising the London agreement, also mentioned that before it published its commentary, "The New York Times" had already spoken. "Borba" wrote that "'The New York Times' has completely and accurately evaluated the agreement on Cyprus from the perspective of the overall interests of the West, and it ( 'The New York Times' ) wrote: 'In terms of its impact on the Eastern Mediterranean and the entire defense system of NATO, the agreement is more important than any detail stipulated in the new order in Cyprus.'" So that's what "Borba" is praising! The Tito clique's claims of "supporting national self-determination," "opposing colonialism," and "non-alignment," etc., can stop now!

    铁托集团揭下了自己的画皮
    新华社记者述评
    在铁托最近几个月访问一些亚非国家期间，南斯拉夫修正主义者特别卖劲地把自己打扮成“支持民族独立”、“维护和平”的战士。但是，人们不仅是“听其言”，而更重要的是“观其行”。远的不说，就拿南斯拉夫对不久前由三个北大西洋成员国（英国、希腊和土耳其）在伦敦签订的关于塞浦路斯协定的评论来说吧。铁托集团的机关报“战斗报”很详尽地对英、希、土伦敦协定作了评价。“战斗报”2月24日专门发表一篇评论写道：“伦敦协定同现今的局势相比是个积极的事实，它开辟了最终解决塞浦路斯问题的远景。”这家报纸竭力企图使塞浦路斯人民相信
  “这一协定给他们和平、改善生活和独自决定自己命运的可能性”。
    3月3日，铁托同希腊首相卡拉曼利斯发表的会谈公报中也明白写道，他们谈到了这个伦敦协定，并认为“塞浦路斯人民通过这个协定获得独立”。
    但是，事情的真相是怎样的呢？伦敦协定虽然名义上规定塞浦路斯成为“独立的共和国”，实际上，英国继续拥有它在那里的军事基地的绝对主权，协定并且规定塞浦路斯必须同希腊和土耳其缔结军事联盟，这两国将在塞浦路斯驻兵，英、希、土三国保留有充分的权利来干涉塞浦路斯事务，它们甚至已经在协定里预先为塞浦路斯未来的宪法决定了每一项要点。由此可见，伦敦协定不过是以三国强加于塞浦路斯的集体殖民主义的形式，保持了英国在那里无法维持下去的统治，把塞浦路斯变为北大西洋集团三个成员国英、希、土三国共管的殖民地和军事基地，并且使得美国能够进一步加强北大西洋侵略集团的南翼。“印度时报”就曾指出，伦敦协定“显然是强加在塞浦路斯人民身上的”，是“极其不利于塞浦路斯人民的”。“印度斯坦时报”等报也认为，伦敦协定是阻碍塞浦路斯独立的锁链。连黎巴嫩的“今天报”也认为英国是伦敦协定的“胜利者”，因为它允许英国保留军事基地并“为所欲为”。
    铁托在希腊会谈的公报以及“战斗报”关于伦敦协定的评论，就这样彻底撕下了铁托集团的“反对殖民主义”的面纱，暴露了铁托集团心目中的“独自决定自己命运”是怎样的货色！
    “战斗报”评论里还竭力要塞浦路斯人民“和平”地接受伦敦协定，它说，“对这一协定最直接的期望是同和平相联系的，和平应该遍及塞浦路斯幸福的橄榄树林。”原来铁托集团主张的“和平”却是要被压迫人民屈从帝国主义统治而不得反抗的“和平”。
    铁托集团在伦敦协定问题上这样顾不得伪装而急忙出来讲话，也是不难理解的。伦敦协定刚一签订后，在幕后策划这个协定的美国国务院立即声明表示欢迎。很明显，主子既已赞赏，奴才哪敢不捧场！“战斗报”在称赞伦敦协定的评论里，也提到在它发表评论以前，“纽约时报”已经有言在先。“战斗报”写道，
  “‘纽约时报’完全精确地从西方整体利益的观点评价了关于塞浦路斯的协定，它（‘纽约时报’）写道：‘按它对东地中海和北大西洋公约组织整个防御体系的影响来说，协定要比在塞浦路斯新秩序方面所规定的任何细节都更重要’。”原来“战斗报”赞扬的就是这个！铁托集团标榜“支持民族自决权”、“反对殖民主义”、“非集团”等等，可以休矣！
