    Factory Histories Can Be Greatly Developed
    Fang Ji
    The activity of compiling factory histories in Tianjin began in the spring of last year. At that time, factories were carrying out communist ideological education. Many veteran workers spoke about the exploitation and oppression they suffered in the old society and their heroic and unyielding struggles, which greatly inspired the new workers who had joined the factory after liberation. The Party Committee of the Cotton Textile Mill, recognizing that this was a good form of education, found people to draw the past lives and struggles of the veteran workers into comic strips and held exhibitions. The Tianjin State-owned No. 3 Cotton Mill was the first to hold a "Factory History Exhibition." The exhibition achieved unexpected results, greatly promoting the ideological education and production of the workers. At that time, many moving phenomena appeared, such as a decrease in the rate of second-grade cloth, an increase in attendance, and greater unity between new and veteran workers. Subsequently, other state-owned cotton mills also began to do the same.
    At this time, Tianjin was launching a mass creation movement. The Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Writers Association learned about this and sent comrades from the "New Port" editorial department to the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill to understand and help. This approach received the support and leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the Chinese Writers Association, and the activity of compiling factory histories in Tianjin began to spread.
    Initially, we were not without doubts about this matter ideologically. We read Gorky's articles on factory history and affirmed the great significance of engaging in factory history from an ideological perspective; at the same time, factories had already started doing it, so we more actively began to do it. But who should we rely on to do it? The writers' strength was small, and they all had their own work. The help of the magazine editorial department initially played an important role in promoting it, but to truly write about the lives and struggles of the workers, we mainly relied on the workers themselves. For example, factory history was transformed from comic strips to text. Initially, it was written by a few worker authors. Later, in order to expand the content and scope of factory history writing, a topic was assigned in the composition class of the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill's workers' night school: "Everyone write a paragraph of factory history." As a result, more than a thousand articles were written at once. Many of them were vivid in content and well-written. In this way, the writing of factory history had a mass base. Some factories also conducted collective discussions and writing in workshops and teams, turning the factory history activity into a mass movement.
    Since the summer of last year, thanks to the attention and leadership of Party committees at all levels, the activity of compiling factory histories has gradually become a city-wide, large-scale, mass writing activity. According to statistics, there are nearly one hundred large factories directly under the control of various districts engaged in compiling factory histories, with tens of thousands of people participating in writing activities and providing materials. Written materials that have already been produced, including some usable articles, amount to three million words. Three factory histories have already been printed and will be published in the short term.
    Carrying out such a large-scale writing activity requires a certain number of key personnel. These key personnel are mainly propaganda cadres of factory Party committees, trade union cadres, Communist Youth League cadres, and worker writing groups from various factories with more than a thousand people. In addition, 400 students from the Chinese and History departments of several universities, such as Nankai University, Normal University, and Normal College, were mobilized to go to factories one or two days a week, or for one or two weeks during the holidays, to record, sort out, and compile factory history materials for the workers. A few professors also participated.
    The activity of compiling factory histories has been going on for nearly a year, and now it can be seen that it has achieved the following significant results:
    Educating Workers and Promoting Production
    First, factory history has played a role in educating and uniting the working class and promoting production. Gorky emphasized in the significance of compiling factory history that the working class should be familiar with the history of its own factory and the development of its industry, and familiar with the history of its class's labor and struggle, in order to understand how the working class, as an emerging class, was organized by modern production, freed itself from the influence of various old forces, became a united and fighting class, and stepped onto the historical stage to complete the mission of transforming the old society and building a new society. In this regard, the workers of the New Port Wharf can be cited as an example. These workers, who were initially deceived poor peasants, bankrupt urban petty bourgeoisie, and vagrants, were deceived by imperialism and its running dogs into the "water prison" outside Dagu Port, where they served heavy labor for their plundering of China's massive resources, living the lives of cattle and horses without freedom and without enough to eat. They spontaneously rose up to fight for enough to eat and freedom. In the struggle, they gradually grew into a united and conscious working class. Subsequently, under the leadership of the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party, they held large-scale, organized, and led strike struggles, even fighting face-to-face with the agents of British imperialism and Japanese imperialists, and burning ships of cotton and oil seized by the imperialists. But in the past, even the workers who participated in these struggles did not fully understand its significance. It was not until this time, when writing factory history, through their recollections, narrations, mutual discussions, and supplements, that these past tragic and heroic historical facts became clearer in their minds, making them realize their own growth process and the meaning of the unity of the working class. In the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill, even such a touching thing was discovered: A strike leader who had been imprisoned by the enemy during the struggle one day suddenly found the lock on his door opened, and he escaped from the clutches of the enemy. However, for the next twenty or thirty years, he never knew who had opened the door, and he did not even have the opportunity to thank the person. When writing factory history, he mentioned this incident, and another veteran worker stood up and said: "That was me! I stole the enemy's key and opened the prison door for you!"
    Almost every factory history is a tragic, heroic, and victorious epic. These facts compare the old and new societies, and the different fates of workers in different societies, in the clearest way possible. Wang Peiyu, a female worker at the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill, was fired three times for being pregnant during the Japanese imperialist occupation. The last time, she tried desperately to tighten her stomach to prevent the enemy from seeing it. But the enemy finally discovered it and beat her severely. Her third daughter was born as a result of this beating. This child, named Li Huiyun, went to work at the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill after liberation and has now become an advanced producer. Two generations, two destinies. People knew these facts in the past, but they could not clearly recognize them. Now that these things have been recorded, they have played a profound educational role in helping the working class understand their own lives and in helping everyone understand how this world was created.
    Enriching the Content of Socialist Literature
    Second, the writing of factory history has enriched the content of our socialist literature. Factory history, although still only in the nature of material and an immature literary work, is of great significance because the working class as the protagonist of the work has been written into our literature on a large scale, even if it is immature. Since last winter, a noteworthy phenomenon has emerged: after the large-scale development of the activity of compiling factory histories, some people have noticed the use of this part of the material for processing and creation. This is first reflected in art, drama, and folk art. Tianjin already has a "Factory History Comic Strip Series" compiled and drawn based on factory history, a drama "Red Trade Union," a Ping Opera "Angry Waves of Bohai," a long storytelling "Havoc in the West Railway Station," and some writers are writing long novels based on factory history. This is a gratifying phenomenon. There is a lot of room for literary and artistic processing and creation based on factory history, because the materials in factory history are extremely rich and extremely moving, and most of them are already semi-finished products.
    Emergence of a Large Number of New Worker Authors
    Third, around the compilation of factory history, a group of worker authors, or the backbone of factory history writing, has emerged. The exact number of this group has not yet been accurately counted. According to the figures from various districts, there are more than a thousand people; according to the figures from the trade unions, there are more than five hundred people; the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Writers Association is directly connected with fifty people. These three figures probably have their own basis and their own meaning, but in any case, worker authors have emerged in batches, and many of them have written quite well from the beginning, reaching a certain level, and are mostly activists in politics and production. Moreover, several female workers have also emerged, which was not the case in the past. Perhaps it can be said that the activity of writing factory history is a better way to cultivate worker authors. The activity of writing factory history in the Soviet Union produced a generation of famous great writers such as Gladkov, Shaginyan, Kataev, and Libedinsky. It is possible that some excellent writers will emerge in our factory history author team in the future.
    Factory History Needs Further Improvement
    Factory history has great potential. The task before us is how to further improve the content, form, and quality of factory history.
    At the beginning, the content of factory history was generally more about suffering and less about struggle. This is probably a law, just like the poor and lower-middle peasants pouring out their grievances during the land reform. But it changed quickly, proving that the working class is different after all. And the more mass the matter becomes, the more obvious its positive significance and militancy become. Now, it is more common to write about the past more and the present less; that is, more about before liberation, and it is written vividly; less about after liberation, and it is more difficult to write, mostly summary articles of past movements, and the characters and stories are much worse. It is also difficult to say that this is because they are not familiar with life, because for workers, this problem does not exist. What is the problem? Perhaps in addition to the understanding and skills of life, there is also the question of how to express the contradictions among the people. This is a new problem, which can only be gradually solved through practice. Another aspect of the problem is that the content of many works is not broad enough, often limited to the factory, or at most writing about a family; there are still very few works that reflect the social landscape and the background of the times by connecting to other social classes through the struggles and lives of workers, and this is an urgent problem to be solved. The richer the content of factory history, the greater the educational role it can play.
    The form of factory history is still vague. As the name suggests, factory history should be a continuous history of a certain factory. But it is very difficult to achieve this, either because the materials are not complete, or because it will be written into a boring chronological record. What has been written and published now are just single stories compiled by year. Only those written with the help of history students are more systematic, but they have really become historical records, with very little literary value. Now it seems that if factory history is to be written richly, vividly, and with greater educational significance, it is better to write struggle stories and character biographies, that is, literary factory history. Forcing perfection will inevitably lead to triviality, rigidity, and simple narration. From this, we thought of the writing of "Records of the Grand Historian." "Records of the Grand Historian" is a great historical book and literary work, and has become a model for later writing of history. Factory history can take the form of "biographies," mainly writing about characters to express it; it can also write about "hereditary houses," that is, the families and collectives of veteran workers. At the same time, the overall picture and development process of a factory can also be written in the form of a "chronological table," such as production development, technological revolution, and its evolution. Even the main leaders of the factory, such as the director, engineer, and Party secretary, can be written in the form of "basic annals," only changing the original meaning of this term. This is a unique form in China, combining literature and history. In addition, there is another form that can be considered, that is, developing into a romantic novel based on the stories of factory history. This was inspired by the storytelling "Havoc in the West Railway Station." This is also our traditional method, just as "Records of the Three Kingdoms" was evolved into "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," the stories of Song Jiang and others were evolved into "Water Margin," and the story of Xuanzang was evolved into "Journey to the West."
    The biggest problem with factory history at present is the quality problem, that is, how to improve it. The current factory history is basically written by two types of people: one is worker authors or factory cadres, and the other is workers dictating and university students recording. Works by workers with a certain level of education, or more skilled worker authors and cadres, are mostly better, with content, emotion, and vivid language; those recorded by university students are not so rich and vivid. This is mainly due to unfamiliarity and lack of understanding of the lives of workers; it is also difficult to fully preserve the characteristics of worker language. This point was raised at the beginning, and the students also worked hard to learn from the workers. But in any case, there is still a process of becoming familiar with the lives and language of the workers. Therefore, if not helped by authors who are familiar with the lives of workers and have a high level of cultivation, the improvement of the quality of factory history will take a considerable amount of time. According to the growth of worker authors in Tianjin, we want to organize the existing dozens of worker authors with a higher level, who have already published some works, to "contract" to write several key factory histories separately. In this way, they can break through the limitations of being limited to their own factory, workshop, and life experience, and can also receive the effect of collective wisdom. These worker authors are familiar with the life of the factory and have already published some works, and have initial experience. On the basis of the original factory history, further processing with guidance may be a faster way. Of course, it is best to have a more mature writer write one out as a sample to set an example.

    工厂史大有可为
    方纪
    天津编写工厂史的活动是去年春天开始的。当时工厂里正进行共产主义思想教育。许多老工人讲出自己在旧社会所受的剥削、压迫和英勇不屈的斗争，给解放以后入厂的新工人很大启发。棉纺党委鉴于这是一种很好的教育方式，便找人把老工人过去的生活和斗争画成连环画，举行展览。天津国棉三厂是最早举行“工厂史展览会”的。这个展览会取得了出人意外的效果，对工人的思想教育和生产起了重大的推动作用，当时出现了许多动人的现象。如次布率下降，出勤率提高，新老工人更团结了等等。之后，其他国棉厂也陆续这样做起来。
    这时，天津正在发动一个群众性的创作运动。中国作家协会天津分会知道了这件事，便派“新港”编辑部的同志到国棉三厂去进行了解和帮助。这种做法得到了天津市委和中国作家协会的支持和领导，天津编写工厂史的活动便普遍地开始了。
    起初，我们对于这件事在思想上不是没有疑问的。我们阅读了高尔基有关工厂史的文章，从思想上肯定了搞工厂史的重大意义；同时工厂里已经搞起来，于是我们便更积极地着手去做。但是依靠谁去搞？作家的力量很少，而且各有各的工作。刊物编辑部的帮助，最初起到了重要的推动作用，但真要写出工人的生活和斗争，主要还是依靠工人自己。例如，工厂史由连环画变成文字，起初是由少数工人作者写，后来为了扩大工厂史的内容和写作范围，在国棉三厂工人夜校的作文课堂上出了一个题目：“每人写一段工厂史”，结果一下子就写出了一千多篇。其中有不少内容生动，写得也很流畅。这样，工厂史的写作有了群众基础。有的工厂还在车间和小组里进行集体讨论和写作，使工厂史活动变成了群众性的。
    去年夏天以来，由于各级党委的重视和领导，编写工厂史的活动逐渐变成了全市性的、大规模的、群众性的写作活动。据统计，现在由各区直接掌握的编写工厂史的大工厂近一百个，参加写作活动和提供材料的有好几万人，已经写出的文字材料，其中包括一部分可用的文章，有三百万字。已经付印、短期内可以出版的工厂史有三部。
    进行这样一个大规模的写作活动，没有一定数量的骨干是不行的。这些骨干，主要是工厂党委的宣传干部，工会干部，共青团干部，以及数在千人以上的各工厂的工人写作小组。除此之外，还动员了南开大学、师范大学、师范学院等几个高等院校的中文系、历史系学生四百人，每周抽一、二天，或在假期中集中一、二个星期，到工厂里去为工人做记录、整理和编写工厂史材料。教授也有个别参加的。
    编写工厂史的活动已经进行了将近一年，现在可以看出来收到了这样一些显著的效果：
    教育工人推动生产
    第一，工厂史起到了教育和团结工人阶级的作用，推动了生产。高尔基在编写工厂史的意义中强调指出，工人阶级应当熟悉自己的工厂和本部门工业发展的历史，熟悉自己阶级的劳动和斗争的历史，以便懂得工人阶级作为一个新兴的阶级，怎样被近代生产组织起来，摆脱各种旧势力的影响，成为一个团结统一的战斗的阶级，登上历史舞台，完成改造旧社会，建设新社会的使命。在这一点上，可以举新港码头工人为例。这些起初是被欺骗的贫苦农民、破产的城市小资产阶级和流浪者，被帝国主义及其走狗骗到大沽口外的“水牢”中，为他们掠夺中国的大量物资服繁重的劳役，而过着不自由、吃不饱的牛马生活。他们自发地起来进行争吃饱、争自由的斗争。在斗争中，逐渐成长为团结的、有觉悟的工人阶级。随后，又在中国共产党地下组织的领导下，举行了大规模的、有组织、有领导的罢工斗争，直到面对面和英帝国主义的代理人进行斗争，和日本帝国主义者进行斗争，成船的烧毁帝国主义者掠夺来的棉花和油料。但是在过去，连参加了这些斗争的工人，也不是都完全明了它的意义，直到这次写工厂史，通过他们的回忆、讲述、相互讨论和补充，这些过去悲惨的和英勇的史实，才在他们面前变得更加鲜明，使他们认识到了自己的成长过程和工人阶级团结的意义。在国棉三厂，甚至发现了这样动人的事，一个过去在斗争中被敌人关起来的罢工领袖，有一天，忽然房门的锁打开了，于是他逃出了敌人的魔掌。但是，过了二、三十年，他始终不知道门是谁打开的，连想要感谢一下这个人的机会都没有。在编写工厂史的时候，他提到了这件事，于是另一个老工人站出来说：“那是我，是我偷了敌人的钥匙，给你打开牢门！”
    几乎每一部工厂史都是一首悲壮的、英勇的、胜利的史诗。这些事实把新旧社会，把工人在不同社会里的不同命运，对比得再明显不过了。国棉三厂有个女工王佩玉，在日本帝国主义统治时期，曾经三次因为怀孕被开除。最后一次，她为了要工作，拼命勒紧肚子，不让敌人看出来。但是，敌人终于发现了，把她痛打一顿。她的第三个女儿，就是在挨打中生产的。这个孩子叫李蕙芸，解放以后进国棉三厂做工，现在已经成了先进生产者。母女两代，两种命运。这些事实，人们过去知道，但却不能清楚地认识它。现在这些事情被记录下来，对工人阶级认识自己的生活，对所有的人认识这个世界是被怎样创造出来的，起了深刻的教育作用。
    丰富社会主义文学内容
    第二，工厂史的写作，丰富了我们的社会主义文学内容。工厂史，在目前虽然还不过是资料性质，是不成熟的文学作品，但是在工人阶级作为作品的主人公被大规模地写进了我们的文学里面，即使是不成熟的，却是意义重大的。去年冬天以来，出现了一种值得注意的现象：就是在编写工厂史的活动大规模开展以后，已经有一些人注意到了利用这一部分材料来进行加工和创作。这首先表现在美术、戏剧和曲艺上。天津已经有了根据工厂史编绘的“工厂史连环画丛书”，有了话剧“红色工会”，有了评剧“渤海怒涛”，有了长篇评书“大闹西车站”，还有个别作家正在根据工厂史写作长篇小说。这是一种可喜的现象。以工厂史为基础，进行文学艺术加工的创作活动，是有很多文章可做的。因为工厂史的材料极为丰富，也极为动人，而且它们本身大部分已经是半成品了。
    涌现出大批新的工人作者
    第三，围绕编写工厂史，出现了一批工人作者，或者说工厂史的写作骨干，这批人究竟有多少，还没有确切统计，根据各区的数字，在一千人以上；根据工会的数字，在五百人以上；中国作家协会天津分会直接联系的是五十个人。这三个数字大概各有各的根据，各有各的意义，但无论如何，成批的出现工人作者，而且一开始就有不少写得相当好，有一定水平，又多是在政治上、生产上的积极分子。而且其中也出现了几个女工作者，这更是过去所没有的。也许可以说，写作工厂史的活动，是培养工人作者的一种较好的方法。苏联写工厂史的活动中，曾产生出一代有名的像革拉特珂夫、沙金娘、卡达耶夫、里别进斯基那样的大作家。在我们的工厂史的作者队伍里，将来也有可能出现一些优秀作家的。
    工厂史需要进一步提高
    工厂史是大有可为的。摆在我们面前的课题，是如何进一步提高工厂史的内容、形式和质量。
    工厂史的内容，在开始的时候，大体上都是写受苦的多，写斗争的少。这大约是规律，和在土地改革时贫雇农倒苦水一样。但是很快就改变了，证明工人阶级究竟不同。而且事情越带群众性，它的积极意义、斗争性，就越加明显地显示出来。现在比较普遍的，是写过去多，写现在少；即写解放以前的多，写得也生动；写解放以后的少，写起来也比较困难，多半是历次运动的总结性的文章，人物、故事性，都比较要差得多。也很难说这是因为对生活不熟悉，因为对工人来说，这个问题是不存在的。这是什么问题呢？也许除了对生活的理解和技巧之外，还有如何表现人民内部矛盾的问题。这是一个新问题，只能从实践中逐步解决。问题的另一个侧面，是许多作品的内容不够宽广，往往只限于工厂内，至多写到一个家庭；联系到社会其他阶层，通过工人的斗争和生活，反映出社会面貌和时代背景的作品还很少，这是亟需解决的问题。工厂史的内容越丰富，教育作用才可能越大。
    工厂史的形式，至今也还是模糊的，顾名思义，工厂史应该是一部连续性的某一个工厂的历史。但做到这一点，很困难，不是材料不齐全，就是会写成枯燥的编年记录。现在写成的，发表的，也不过是按年编就的单篇的故事。只有历史系学生帮助编写的，比较系统，但也真成了历史记录，文学价值很少了。现在看来，工厂史要写得充实、生动，教育意义更大，还是以写斗争故事，人物传记为好，即文学性的工厂史。勉强求全，就难免失之琐碎、呆板、平铺直叙。由此我们想到了“史记”的写法。“史记”是一部伟大的史书和文学作品，而且成为后来写史的范本。工厂史，是可以采取“列传”的形式，主要写人物来表现的；也可以写“世家”，即老工人的家庭和集体。同时用“年表”的形式，也可以写出一个工厂的全貌和发展过程来，如生产发展、技术革命及其演变等等。甚至厂里主要负责人——如厂长、工程师、党委书记等，也可用“本纪”的形式来写，只不过改变了这个术语的本来意义罢了。这是我们中国特有的形式，把文学和历史结合起来。此外，还有一种形式可以考虑，即在工厂史的故事的基础上，发展成为演义性的小说。这是受“大闹西车站”这部评书的启发想到的。这也是我们的传统方法，正如把“三国志”演成“三国演义”，把宋江等的故事演义成“水浒”，把玄奘故事演义成“西游记”那样。
    工厂史当前最大的问题是质量问题，也就是如何提高的问题。现在的工厂史基本是两种人写的，一是工人作者或工厂干部，一是工人口述大学生作记录。有一定文化水平的工人，或比较熟练的工人作者和干部的作品，多半是比较好的。有内容，有感情，语言生动；大学生记录的，就不是那样丰富和生动了。这主要是由于不熟悉、不理解工人的生活；工人语言的特点，也难以充分保留下来。这一点，一开始就提起过注意，学生们也努力向工人学习。但无论如何，熟悉工人的生活和语言，还有一个过程。因此，如果不是有比较熟悉工人生活，又是修养较高的作者去帮助，工厂史质量的提高，将要经过相当长的时间。根据天津工人作者成长的情况，我们想把现有的水平较高的，已经发表过一些作品的几十个工人作者组织起来，分头去“包写”几部重点的工厂史。这样，他们既可以打破局限于本厂、本车间、本身生活经历的限制，而又能收到集思广益的效果。这些工人作者既熟悉工厂的生活，也已发表过一些作品，有了初步的经验，在原有工厂史的基础上，有指导地做进一步的加工，可能是一个较快的办法。当然，最好是有比较成熟的作家写一部出来，做为样本，起一个示范作用。
