Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 27th: Prince Sihanouk said in Battambang Province on the 26th that certain countries have not abandoned their conspiracies against Cambodia, and now they hope to find new figures to replace Choeung Moch.

Prince Sihanouk revealed that after the death of Choeung Moch, Son Ngoc Thanh's capable assistant, Pok Khun, organized a gathering at the Preah Vihear Temple in Thailand on March 8th, where he announced a new conspiracy to find Cambodian traitors to achieve their goals. Pok Khun said that the United States had agreed to support this new attempt. Prince Sihanouk added that he had just received a letter from Cambodian Ambassador to Japan, Sim Var, which informed him that Son Ngoc Thanh had recently written to him, asking him to contact Prince Penn Nouth, Nhiek Tioulong, Lon Nol, Tiv Ol, and Dy Touch in order to "correct" Cambodia's current policies. Sim Var told Prince Sihanouk that he had not contacted Son Ngoc Thanh and remained loyal to the Prince. The Prince also said that Son Ngoc Thanh had written to the two Supreme Patriarchs of Buddhism for the same purpose.

Prince Sihanouk pointed out that Cambodia's neutrality is well-assured. First, it is the unity of the people across the nation, relying on which Cambodia has successfully suppressed foreign-backed conspiracies and rebellions. Second, Cambodia's neutrality is supported by some foreign countries. He said that during the Water Festival, Chinese Vice Premier Chen Yi announced in Beijing in front of foreign envoys that the Chinese government fully supports Cambodia's struggle to maintain its neutrality and independence. The Soviet government recently also told Cambodia that it supports Cambodia's neutrality and its struggle against foreign conspiracies. Sihanouk added that Britain told him that Britain would not be involved in conspiracies against Cambodia and that it also supports Cambodia's neutrality.

The Prince said: "In the eyes of our people, our outstanding figures, and our students, neutrality is the best path. In this case, why should I change my policy? Do people think that joining a military bloc will bring us peace?"

### 西哈努克在巡视马德望省时说  中立是柬埔寨的最好道路

    西哈努克在巡视马德望省时说
    中立是柬埔寨的最好道路
    新华社金边27日电　西哈努克亲王26日在马德望省说，某些国家并没有放弃它们反对柬埔寨的阴谋，现在它们希望寻找新人物来替代琼·莫舒皮。
    西哈努克亲王透露，在琼·莫舒皮死后，山玉成的得力助手朴空3月8日在泰国的巴盖庙组织了一个集会，在会上他宣布了他们要另找柬埔寨的卖国贼来实现他们目标的新阴谋。朴空说，美国同意支持这个新企图。西哈努克亲王又说，他刚收到柬埔寨驻日本大使沈法的一封信，这封信告诉他，最近山玉成写信给他，要他同宾努亲王、涅刁隆、朗诺、丁东、丁沅接触以便“改正”柬埔寨目前的政策。沈法对西哈努克亲王说，他没有同山玉成接触，仍忠于亲王。亲王又说，山玉成还为了同样的目的写信给两位僧王。
    西哈努克亲王指出，柬埔寨的中立是很有保证的。首先是全国人民的团结，依靠这种团结，柬埔寨成功地镇压了外国支持的阴谋叛乱。其次，柬埔寨的中立是得到一些外国支持的。他说，在灯笃节，中国副总理陈毅在北京曾经当着各国使节的面宣布，中国政府完全支持柬埔寨为维护自己的中立和独立而进行的斗争。苏联政府最近也对柬埔寨说，它支持柬埔寨的中立和反对外国阴谋的斗争。西哈努克又说，英国对他说，英国不会牵涉到反对柬埔寨的阴谋中去，它也支持柬埔寨中立。
    亲王说：“在我国人民、我国杰出人士和学生看来，中立是最好的道路。在这种情况下，我为什么要改变方针呢？难道人们认为，参加一个军事集团会给我们带来和平么？”
