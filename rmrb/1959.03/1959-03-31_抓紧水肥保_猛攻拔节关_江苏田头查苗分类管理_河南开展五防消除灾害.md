Grasp Water and Fertilizer to Ensure Growth, Vigorously Attack the Jointing Stage
Jiangsu Conducts Field Inspections and Categorized Management of Seedlings; Henan Launches "Five Defenses" to Eliminate Disasters

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, March 30th dispatch) While carrying out spring plowing and sowing, Jiangsu is also strengthening the management of the jointing stage of the three wheats (barley, wheat, and naked barley) with greater care and diligence. The vast numbers of cadres and commune members are adopting methods such as in-depth field inspections and comparisons, categorizing and ranking fields and seedlings one by one, and implementing different management practices according to the seedlings and categories, striving for every seedling to have an ear, every plant to have large ears, every ear to have many grains, and every grain to be full.

Jiangsu Province's more than 33 million mu of three wheats, after careful cultivation and management by the people of the province, have successfully passed the greening stage. At present, most of the wheat seedlings have entered the jointing stage, and the seedlings are generally growing vigorously. Based on past experience, the people of the province believe that after the "head" of the three wheats is well managed, even greater efforts must be made to grasp the "waist" and "tail" of the three wheats. Therefore, the management methods in various places are becoming more and more scientific and meticulous.

As the wheat seedlings enter the jointing stage, counties and people's communes everywhere are universally organizing inspection groups composed of cadres, experienced farmers, technicians, and commune members to conduct large-scale inspections, comparisons, and promotions in the fields. They universally adopt the method of inspecting the seedlings block by block, categorizing the fields and seedlings, proposing different requirements and measures, and conducting different management practices. This not only effectively strengthens the scientific management of the jointing stage of the three wheats, but also greatly promotes balanced growth over large areas. Recently, Taizhou County organized a ten-thousand-person inspection group to meet in the fields, adopting the method of seeing every block, inspecting every mu, discussing, comparing, and mobilizing the masses to formulate specific measures, further launching a red flag competition movement with 200,000 people participating in a large area of high-yield production, greatly improving the quality of field management during the jointing stage of the three wheats.

During the large-scale inspections, all localities have conducted a comprehensive and intensive overhaul of the existing drainage ditches in accordance with the requirements of high-standard irrigation and drainage systems. Based on the situation in previous years, there is more rainfall in the area south of the Huai River and on both sides of the Yangtze River from the beginning of spring to the summer harvest, and the groundwater level in the areas along the river and lake is relatively high. The three wheats have historically been susceptible to waterlogging. Therefore, the issue of water has become one of the important issues to ensure a bumper harvest. This year's irrigation and drainage systems in various parts of Jiangsu are better than in any previous year. Although there has been more rainfall since the Spring Festival, no waterlogging damage has been suffered due to the timely elimination of water disasters.

As the three wheats enter the jointing stage, Jiangsu has further strengthened the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests of the three wheats. At present, disease and insect pest forecasting and reporting stations have been established in various special zones and some counties, and disease and insect pest prevention and control headquarters have been established in many counties and people's communes. Production brigades have established information stations, and production teams have established information officers. A vigorous movement to produce indigenous pesticides has also been launched throughout the province.

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, March 30th dispatch) While vigorously attacking the wheat jointing stage, the vast areas of Henan Province are implementing the spirit of "water, fertilizer, and protection" simultaneously, and launching a "five defenses" movement throughout the province: defending against frost, defending against diseases and insects, defending against wind and sand, defending against lodging, and defending against trampling by livestock.

At present, the wheat in the province is growing very well, and in most areas it has already jointed to a height of more than one chi, but due to less rain and snow and higher temperatures last winter, diseases and insect pests have begun to be discovered in some areas, and various areas are taking emergency measures to eliminate and control them. The Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to launch a concentrated insect control campaign from mid-March to April 5, requiring that no plot be missed and no insect be released. In order to grasp the law of insect pest growth, each county has established an insect control headquarters, and the entire region has also established more than 8,800 insect situation monitoring stations, trained more than 23,490 technicians, and prepared 6 million jin of various "666" pesticide powders, and rushed to make 1.6 million jin of various indigenous pesticides. Wheat rust is currently relatively common, and more than 40 counties in the province have experienced varying degrees of disease. In order to prevent the spread of this disease as soon as possible, in addition to allocating 4 million jin of sulfur to areas with severe disease, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has also universally promoted the experience of using indigenous methods for prevention and control.

Preparations for frost prevention and lodging prevention have also been started early in various places. According to statistics from Xincai, Guangshan, Suiping and other five counties in Xinyang Prefecture, more than 239,000 field frost prevention platforms have been established, and more than 100 million jin of dry foam for field smoke has been prepared. Preventing lodging of high-yield wheat is a serious task at present. This year, the high-yield wheat in large areas is growing particularly vigorously. In order to prevent lodging of high-yield wheat, various places generally apply more plant ash, and some also build wooden frames or use ropes and kudzu vines to form a net. Lushan County has also taken measures to cut leaves and remove seedlings and eliminate ineffective tillers in high-yield fields, and the effect is very good.

    抓紧水肥保　猛攻拔节关
    江苏田头查苗分类管理　河南开展五防消除灾害
    本报南京30日电　江苏各地在开展春耕春种工作的同时，更加细致踏实地加强三麦（大麦小麦和元麦）拔节期的管理。广大干部社员采取深入田头检查评比，逐田逐苗分类排队，按苗按类进行不同管理的方法，力争苗苗有穗，株株穗大，穗穗粒多，粒粒饱满。
    江苏省三千三百多万亩三麦，经过全省人民精细加工管理，已经胜利地闯过了返青关。目前，大部分麦苗已进入拔节期，麦苗普遍生长旺盛。全省人民根据历年来的经验，三麦的“头”抓好了，还必须用更大的努力抓住三麦的“腰”和“尾”。因此，各地的管理方法越来越科学，越来越细致。
    在麦苗进入拔节期时，各地的县和人民公社都普遍组织有干部、老农、技术人员和社员参加的检查团，深入田头进行大检查、大评比、大促进。普遍采取逐块看苗，按田按苗排出不同的类型，提出不同的要求和措施，进行不同的管理。这样不仅有效地加强了三麦拔节期的科学管理，也大大促进了大面积生长平衡。泰州县最近组织万人检查团会师田头，采取块块看到、亩亩查到，边看苗、边议论、边评比、边发动群众订出具体措施的办法，进一步掀起了有二十万人参加的大面积高额丰产的红旗竞赛运动，大大提高了三麦拔节期田间管理的质量。
    各地在大检查中，都根据高标准排灌系统的要求，对现有的排水沟进行了一次全面的突击整理。根据历年来的情况，淮河以南地区和长江两岸地区，在入春到夏收这段时间内雨水较多，沿江沿湖地区的地下水位都较高，历来三麦易受涝害，因此，水的问题，也就成为确保丰收的重要问题之一。今年江苏各地的排灌系统比以往任何一年做得好，春节以后虽然雨水较多，由于能够及时排除水患，未受一点涝害。
    江苏各地在三麦进入拔节关时，进一步加强了三麦病虫害的防治工作。目前，各个专区和一部分县都设立了病虫害预测预报站，许多县和人民公社都建立了防治病虫害指挥部，生产大队建立了情报站，生产队设立了情报员。全省各地还掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的大搞土农药的运动。

    本报郑州30日电　河南省广大地区在猛攻小麦拔节关的同时，贯彻“水、肥、保”三管齐下的精神，在全省开展一个防霜冻、防病虫、防风沙、防倒伏、防牲畜践踏的五防运动。
    目前全省小麦生长非常良好，大部分地区已经拔节一尺多高，但是由于去冬雨雪少，气温较高，部分地区已经开始发现病虫害，各个地区正采取紧急措施进行除治。中共南阳地委决定从3月中旬到4月5日以前开展一个突击治虫运动，要求一块不漏，一虫不放。为了掌握虫害生长的规律，各县都建立了防虫指挥部，全区还建立虫情测报站八千八百多个，培训技术人员二万三千四百九十多人，准备了各种不同成分的“六六六”药粉六百万斤，赶制各种土农药一百六十万斤。当前小麦锈病比较普遍，全省有四十多个县都发生轻重不同的病害，为了及早防治这种病害的蔓延，省农业厅除已调拨四百万斤硫黄给病害严重的地区外，还普遍推广用土法防治的经验。　　防霜冻、防倒伏的准备工作各地也及早动手。信阳专区新蔡、光山、遂平等五个县统计，就建立田间防霜台二十三万九千多个；并且准备了田头熏烟用的干沫子一亿多斤。防止丰产方小麦倒伏，是当前一项严重的任务。今年大面积的丰产方小麦生长得特别旺盛，各地为了防止丰产方小麦倒伏，普遍多施草木灰，有的还搭上木架或用绳子、葛条牵成网。鲁山县还对高产田采取了剪叶去苗，去掉无效分药的措施，效果很好。
