In the Flame Mountain People's Commune

The Flame Mountain Commune in Turpan County, Xinjiang, has established twenty-five nurseries and kindergartens. This is Aibibuhan, the nanny of the sixth production team's kindergarten, giving milk tea to the children.

Members of the Flame Mountain People's Commune are leveling land.

The old workers of the commune's woodworking factory, Turdi and Tursun, are installing their newly designed cotton seed selection machine.

These photos were taken by Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Wenyu.
