To strive for a Bumper Harvest of Spring Wheat, Start with Sowing
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

In 1958, the nation's spring wheat achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The sown area was 43.19 million mu, and the total output increased by 63% compared with 1957. The yield per unit area increased by 83% compared with 1957.

The main reason for the bumper harvest of spring wheat in various regions in 1958 was the political leadership, the thorough implementation of the general line of building socialism, the full mobilization of the masses, the overcoming of right-leaning conservative ideology, and the clearing of all obstacles on the road to the Great Leap Forward on the basis of the anti-rightist, rectification, and uprooting white flags and planting red flags movements. In terms of technical measures, the main focus was on conscientiously implementing the Eight-Point Charter for agriculture—water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, and management—breaking through past conventions, and particularly grasping the central link of increasing planting density.

After studying the main experiences of spring wheat bumper harvests in 1958, the following opinions are put forward on the cultivation techniques for large-scale bumper harvests in 1959, mainly the cultivation techniques during the spring sowing stage.

Deep plowing to about one chi (Chinese foot, about 1/3 meter), achieving top-turning and bottom-loosening, maintaining good root development, and increasing resistance to lodging.

Deep plowing can promote good root development of wheat and strong growth of the above-ground parts of the plant, enhancing resistance to lodging. According to the survey of spring wheat bumper harvest experiences in various regions in 1958, the plowing depth of those with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu was generally between seven cun (Chinese inch, about 1/30 meter) and one chi, and those with more than 2,000 jin generally had a plowing depth of more than one chi two or three cun. We preliminarily believe that under the conditions of large-scale spring wheat bumper harvests, a plowing depth of about one chi is more realistic. The plowing depth in various regions can be adjusted according to the specific conditions of labor, livestock power, and tools. In addition, deep plowing must be combined with increased fertilization and layered mixed fertilization, otherwise it is difficult to achieve the expected yield increase.

One of the characteristics of spring wheat areas is the low soil temperature, and the difference in soil temperature between the cultivated layer and the subsoil layer is even more significant. According to the survey results of Qinghai Saishike Farm, in the two months of June and July when spring wheat grows most vigorously, the monthly average soil temperature at the surface and 20 cm deep are different by 1.7 to 2.8 degrees Celsius, respectively. The difference between the average soil temperature below 20 cm and the surface will be even greater. Other spring wheat areas have similar situations. If the soil temperature is too low, the activity of microorganisms in the soil is weak and short, nutrients cannot be fully decomposed, and the soil fertility is not high. This characteristic shows that deepening the cultivated layer in spring wheat areas can increase soil temperature and promote the activity of microorganisms in the soil, which plays a greater role than in winter wheat areas. In spring wheat areas, the best way to deepen the cultivated layer is to use the method of top-turning and bottom-loosening. The plowing depth of the topsoil can be increased gradually each year according to the previous plowing depth, and the loosening depth of the subsoil layer can be determined according to the specific situation.

Increase fertilizer application, apply 10,000 to 20,000 to 30,000 to 50,000 jin of high-quality soil manure per mu, apply layered mixed fertilizer, apply 10 to 15 jin each of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer mixed chemical fertilizer as seed fertilizer before sowing, and topdress in stages.

Increasing fertilizer application is of particular importance to spring wheat production. The soil temperature in spring wheat areas is low, and increasing the application of organic fertilizer can increase the soil temperature and promote the decomposition of nutrients originally present in the soil by microorganisms. Due to the large temperature difference between the topsoil layer and the subsoil layer in spring wheat areas, the root system is distributed more and active in the topsoil layer, so it is necessary to ensure the supply of water and nutrients in the topsoil layer with higher soil temperature to fully meet the needs of plant growth and development.

In response to these environmental characteristics of spring wheat areas, applying more fully decomposed organic fertilizer in the topsoil layer can have an extremely good effect on the growth of spring wheat. Qinghai Delingha Farm once observed the following facts: on plots where fertilizer that was not fully decomposed was applied, wheat seedlings were yellow, weak, and thin for a long time, and the yield was reduced by 15%-20% compared to wheat fields where the same amount of decomposed fertilizer was applied. The reason is that the temperature is very low during the seedling growth period of spring wheat, and applying more decomposed manure in the topsoil layer can quickly meet the nutrients needed for seedling growth. Therefore, how to take effective measures (such as heating with a kang, etc.) to promote the decomposition of manure before applying fertilizer on the ground is a problem that deserves special attention. According to the survey of spring wheat bumper harvest experiences in various regions in 1958, the amount of soil manure applied per mu is generally between 15,000 and 50,000 jin. In order to meet the requirements of large-scale spring wheat bumper harvests, in areas with fertile land and wide fields (such as Northeast China), 10,000 to 20,000 jin of high-quality soil manure is required per mu; in other areas (such as the Hexi Corridor), 30,000 to 50,000 jin is required per mu. Most of these fertilizers must be used as base fertilizer and applied before winter; otherwise, it is difficult to apply a large amount of fertilizer into the soil in early spring due to seeding on frozen ground.

Due to the early sowing date and low ground temperature of spring wheat, the decomposition of organic matter is slow. Relying solely on the application of decomposed manure cannot fully meet the nutrients needed for seedling growth and development. Therefore, it is also very necessary to apply 10 to 15 jin each of nitrogen and phosphorus mixed chemical fertilizer as seed fertilizer at the same time as sowing.

Topdressing of spring wheat should be done early and in stages. Spring wheat begins to tiller shortly after the third leaf appears, which marks the beginning of the differentiation of the primordial body of the ear of the main stem. The time from tillering to jointing of spring wheat is generally only about 30 days. At the same time, after spring wheat begins to tiller, the temperature rises rapidly, the plant grows rapidly, and a large amount of fertilizer is needed. Therefore, applying quick-acting fertilizer at this time plays a great role. The jointing stage begins to differentiate the primordial body of the flower, and topdressing can increase the number of grains on the spikelets. Therefore, topdressing is also very necessary at this stage. Early topdressing has a particularly good effect if it is combined with phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, and late topdressing also has a certain effect. However, if too much nitrogen fertilizer is applied in the later stage, it is easy to cause excessive vegetative growth, late maturity, and severe lodging, which should be paid attention to.

On the basis of increasing fertilizer application, it is also necessary to combine with appropriate irrigation to fully exert the yield-increasing effect of fertilizer. According to the survey of spring wheat bumper harvest experiences in various regions in 1958, irrigation is generally required four to six times during the entire growth period of spring wheat. The main periods for irrigation are tillering, jointing, booting, heading, and grain filling. The results of the spring wheat irrigation experiment of the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences show that the first irrigation at tillering is the most important. The experience of some state-owned farms in Qinghai is that two irrigations at tillering and jointing are essential. It should be noted that watering at jointing should not be too frequent or too heavy to avoid excessive growth.

Increase the seeding rate to 30 to 50 jin per mu, achieving 400,000 to 800,000 ears per mu, use a seeder to sow evenly in narrow rows to ensure even and strong seedlings.

In recent years' production practice, dense planting has become one of the main yield-increasing measures that has been tested for a long time. Especially in 1958, when farmers in various regions launched a climax of deep plowing and increased fertilizer application, the yield-increasing effect of dense planting became even more prominent.

The yield of wheat depends on the number of ears per unit area, the average number of grains per ear, and the size of the grain. Spring wheat generally tillers less. Although tillering increases under sparse sowing conditions, the time from tillering to jointing of spring wheat is short, that is, the differentiation process of the ear primordial body is faster, often forming small spikelets or becoming ineffective tillers, which is of course unfavorable to spring wheat production. How to increase the number of main stem ears per unit area and ensure large ears, many grains, and large grains is the key to determining the yield of spring wheat. Therefore, for spring wheat, appropriately increasing the seeding rate on the basis of deep plowing and increased fertilizer application is more important than for winter wheat.

In 1958, we investigated and studied the spring wheat bumper harvest experience with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu in Northeast and Northwest China. According to the survey results, the seeding rate for spring wheat with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu ranged from 22 jin to 50 jin, and the number of ears per mu ranged from 317,000 to 1 million ears. In the nine bumper harvest experience surveys, seven cases had a seeding rate of 32 jin to 42 jin, one case had 22 jin, and one case had 50 jin; six cases had 470,000 to 800,000 ears per mu, two cases had 310,000 to 320,000, and one case had 1 million. We believe that these figures can be used as a reference. If you want to achieve a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu on a large area of spring wheat, a seeding rate of 22 jin per mu is obviously too little. Calculating an average of 15,000 grains per jin of wheat seed, a seeding rate of 22 jin is about 330,000 grains. If the land preparation quality is poor or the germination rate is less than 90%, the actual number of seedlings per mu may be less than 300,000 plants, and it is not easy to achieve 400,000 to 800,000 ears. At the same time, it is not necessary to exceed 45 jin to 50 jin per mu, because conditions such as land preparation, fertilization, and irrigation are limited on a large area. If these conditions cannot keep up, it may cause a danger of reduced production; too much seeding rate will also cause a tight supply of seeds and a waste of seeds.

Based on the above analysis, if you want to achieve a yield of more than 1,000 jin of spring wheat per mu on a large area, it is more appropriate to set the seeding rate at 30 jin to 50 jin per mu and achieve 400,000 to 800,000 ears per mu. Various regions can choose the most suitable seeding rate according to regional characteristics and specific conditions such as land preparation, fertilization, irrigation, and varieties.

While increasing the seeding rate, it is also necessary to achieve narrow-row and even sowing to ensure full and strong seedlings so that dense planting can play its due role in increasing yield. The horse-drawn seeder has been confirmed as the best tool for achieving narrow-row and even sowing in both the Northeast and Northwest spring wheat areas. Through the survey of 14 spring wheat bumper harvest experiences in 1958, the row spacing is generally between 7.5 cm and 15 cm, with about 10 cm being more common. If the row spacing is too large, the land cannot be fully utilized; if the row spacing is too small, missing seedlings and broken ridges are often caused due to the difficulty in ensuring the quality of land preparation.

Among the 14 bumper harvest experiences surveyed, seven adopted the method of cross-sowing, which can make the wheat seeds distributed more evenly and not squeezed on a line, thereby expanding the land utilization area and increasing the efficiency of light energy utilization. However, the time for timely sowing of spring wheat is very short. Within the appropriate sowing period, it is necessary to strive to complete the sowing work in the shortest possible time. Cross-sowing doubles the workload and can be promoted if labor and livestock power permit.

Sow early at the appropriate time and rush to complete the sowing in a short period of time.

The earliness of the sowing period plays an extremely important role in the yield of spring wheat. When the soil thaws to a sufficient sowing depth, time should be seized to rush to sow. Because the length of time for the differentiation of the ear primordial body of spring wheat is closely related to the temperature, the earlier the sowing date, the earlier the wheat seedlings grow, and the lower the temperature during the differentiation period of the ear primordial body, the longer the differentiation time, and the ears may differentiate larger; conversely, the later the sowing date, the later the wheat seedlings grow, and when the differentiation period of the ear primordial body arrives, the temperature rises rapidly, prompting the ear primordial body to shorten the differentiation time, and the ears may become shorter and smaller.

Early sowing of spring wheat can also relatively advance the maturity period, which is also very beneficial for avoiding harvesting difficulties caused by the rainy season in Northeast China and the danger of early frost damage in Northwest China.

Although spring wheat should be sown as early as possible in principle, according to the experience of Qinghai Saishike Farm and some state-owned farms in the Beian area of Heilongjiang, early sowing of spring wheat is not necessarily beneficial. The reason is that the temperature and soil temperature are low when sowing is too early, the emergence time is long, and the seedlings appear thin, yellow, and weak after emergence, and the growth is not strong. Sometimes, if the emergence is too early and the temperature suddenly drops sharply, it is also easy to suffer from frost damage. Therefore, spring wheat should strive to sow early at the appropriate time. The temperature rises rapidly in spring, and the so-called suitable time for sowing spring wheat is extremely short. It is necessary to mobilize all forces and rush to sow during the time suitable for sowing spring wheat, and never delay the time and miss the appropriate time for sowing spring wheat, resulting in reduced production losses.

Select fine varieties, tap the potential of local varieties, actively cultivate new fine varieties, and strengthen introduction to overcome the phenomenon of single varieties.

Through the summary of the spring wheat bumper harvest experience in 1958, it can be seen that the selection of fine varieties is one of the important measures to ensure increased production. Especially after the adoption of measures such as dense planting, deep plowing, and increased fertilizer application, the production level has been greatly improved. Under this situation, the superiority of fine varieties is more prominent. Conversely, even a fine variety will hardly be able to exert its high-yield potential if it does not have superior cultivation conditions. Therefore, the so-called fine variety must be combined with specific cultivation conditions. When selecting fine varieties, various regions must not only pay attention to their high-yield characteristics, but also conduct a detailed analysis of other characteristics of the variety. In response to the main problems existing in spring wheat production in the local area, select varieties with characteristics such as strong stalks, disease resistance, tight mouth, and early maturity, respectively. It is unrealistic to expect a variety to have all the excellent traits. However, the selected fine varieties must help solve the main problems existing in local production in order to achieve stable and high yields, which is very important.

Stem rust disease is serious in the Northeast spring wheat area over the years, and special attention should be paid to selecting varieties resistant to stem rust disease. The Northwest spring wheat area has a higher production level and a shorter growing season, and the danger of early frost damage is greater. Except for individual areas, the threat of stem rust disease is not great, and attention should be paid to selecting varieties with early maturity and strong stalks. In addition to farmer varieties, the fine varieties currently promoted include Gansu 96, Biyu Wheat, Wugong 774, Sanlian No. 2, and Nanda 2419 in Northwest China, and Gansu 96, Songhua River No. 1, Cooperation No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 in Northeast China. In addition, some new disease-resistant hybrid fine varieties will be promoted soon.

In general, the number of fine varieties in the current spring wheat area is still not large. In the past, the variety selection work failed to adapt well to the needs of production development, and naturally formed a phenomenon of single varieties, which is extremely unfavorable to ensuring the stability of spring wheat yield. This problem must be given due attention in a timely manner.

    争取春小麦丰产要从播种抓起
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1958年全国春小麦获得了空前大丰收。播种面积四千三百一十九万亩，总产量比1957年增长63％。单位面积产量比1957年增长83％。
    1958年各地区春小麦获得丰收的主要原因是由于政治挂帅，深入地贯彻执行了建设社会主义的总路线，充分发动了群众，克服了右倾保守思想，在反右、整风、拔白旗插红旗运动的基础上，扫除了跃进道路上的一切障碍。在技术措施方面，主要是认真贯彻了水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管八字宪法，突破了过去的陈规，特别是抓紧了增加播种密度这一中心环节。
    研究1958年春小麦的主要丰产经验以后，对1959年大面积丰产栽培技术，主要是春播阶段的栽培技术措施，提出如下的意见。
    深耕一尺左右，作到上翻下松，保持根系发育良好，增加抗倒伏能力。
    深耕可以促使小麦根系发育良好和地上部分的植株生长健壮，增强抵抗倒伏的能力。根据1958年各地春小麦丰产经验的调查，亩产一千多斤的，一般耕翻深度在七寸到一尺之间，二千斤以上的耕深多在一尺二、三寸。我们初步认为，在春小麦大面积丰产的条件下，耕翻深度在一尺左右是比较现实的。各地区耕翻深度，可以根据劳畜力和工具等具体条件酌加伸缩。此外，深耕还必须与增施肥料和分层混合施肥相结合，否则难望达到预期的增产效果。
    春麦区的特点之一是土温较低，耕作层与底土层土温相差更为显著。根据青海赛什克农场调查结果，在春小麦生长最旺盛的6、7两个月，地表与二十厘米土层深处，月平均土温分别相差摄氏一度七到二度八，至于二十厘米以下与地表平均土温相差当更为悬殊。其他春麦区也有类似情况。土温太低，土壤中微生物活动弱而时间短，养料不能充分分解，土壤肥力就不高。这个特点说明，在春麦区加深耕层可以增加土温，促进土壤中微生物的活动，较冬麦区所起作用更大。在春麦区加深耕层最好采用上翻下松的办法，表土耕翻深度可按以往耕地深度逐年酌量增加，底土层松土深度，可根据具体情况来决定。
    增施肥料，每亩施用质量较好的土粪一、二万到三、五万斤，分层混合施肥，播前每亩施用氮、磷肥料各十到十五斤的混合化肥作种肥，分期追肥。
    增施肥料对于春小麦生产来说具有特别重要的意义。春麦区土温较低，增施有机质肥料，可以提高土温，促使微生物分解土壤中原来存在的养分。由于春麦区的表土层与底土层温差较大，表土层中根系分布多，活动强，因此应该很好地保证土温较高的表土层中的水份和养料的供应，以充分满足植物生长发育的需要。
    针对春麦区的这些环境特点，在表土层中施入较多的充分腐熟的有机质肥料，对于春小麦生长能起极为良好的作用。青海德令哈农场曾观察到下列的事实：施用没有充分腐熟肥料的地块上，麦苗在很长时间内黄弱纤细，比施用同等数量腐熟肥料的麦田减产15％—20％。原因在于春小麦幼苗生长期间气温很低，表土层多施腐熟的厩肥，可以迅速满足麦苗生长所需的养料。因此在整地上粪以前，如何采取有效措施（例如火炕加温等等）来促进厩肥的腐熟，是一个值得十分注意的问题。根据1958年各地春小麦丰产经验的调查，每亩土粪施用量一般在一万五到五万斤之间。为了满足春小麦大面积丰产的要求，在地肥地广的地区（如东北），每亩需施用质量较好的土粪一、二万斤；在其他地区（如河西走廊），每亩需施用三、五万斤。这些肥料大部分必须作基肥，于冬前施下；否则，在早春由于顶凌播种，大量肥料是难以全部施入土中的。
    春小麦由于播种期早，地温低，有机质分解慢，仅靠施用腐熟的厩肥还不能完全满足幼苗生长发育所需要的养料。因此在播种的同时，每亩施用氮、磷各十到十五斤混合的化学肥料作为种肥，也是十分必要的。
    春小麦追肥宜早，并应分期追肥。春小麦在第三叶出现后不久即开始分蘖，此时标志着主茎开始分化穗的原始体。春小麦分蘖至拔节，一般不过三十天左右，同时春小麦自分蘖开始以后，气温上升很快，植株迅速生长，需要大量肥料供应，因此，在这时追施速效肥料是起很大作用的。拔节期开始分化花的原始体，追肥能增加小穗上粒数，因此，这个时期追肥也是十分必要的。早期追肥如能配合磷、钾肥效果尤为良好，后期追肥也有一定作用。但如后期氮肥追施过多，容易造成贪青晚熟，严重倒伏等问题，应加注意。
    在增施肥料的基础上还必须结合适当的灌溉，才能充分发挥肥料的增产作用。根据1958年各地春小麦丰产经验的调查，在春小麦生育全期，一般需要灌溉四到六次。灌溉的主要时期是分蘖、拔节、孕穗、抽穗和灌浆。黑龙江省农业科学研究所春小麦灌溉试验的结果，说明其中分蘖一水是最重要的。青海一些国营农场的经验，分蘖和拔节两水是必不可少的。应该注意的是拔节时浇水不宜太勤、太大，以免引起徒长。
    播种量增加至每亩三十到五十斤，每亩达到四十到八十万穗，用播种机窄行匀播，保证苗齐苗壮。
    密植在近年生产实践中已成为久经考验的主要增产措施之一，特别是1958年在各地农民掀起了深翻土地、增施肥料的高潮中，密植的增产作用，显得更为突出。
    小麦的产量决定于单位面积的穗数、每穗平均粒数和籽粒大小。春小麦一般分蘖较少，在稀播的情况下，分蘖虽然增多了，但是由于春小麦从分蘖至拔节时间较短，亦即穗原始体分化过程较快，往往形成小穗或变为无效分蘖，这对于春小麦的生产当然是不利的。如何增加单位面积主茎穗数，以及保证穗大、粒多、粒大，是决定春小麦产量的关键问题。所以对于春小麦说来，在深翻土地、增施肥料的基础上，适当地增加播种量，比冬小麦具有更为重要的意义。
    1958年我们调查研究了东北、西北亩产千斤以上的春小麦丰产经验总结，根据调查结果，春小麦亩产一千多斤的，播种量自二十二斤到五十斤，每亩穗数自三十一点七万到一百万穗。在九个丰产经验调查中，有七例播种量在三十二斤到四十二斤，一例二十二斤，一例五十斤；有六例每亩穗数在四十七万到八十万，二例在三十一万到三十二万，一例一百万。我们认为这些数字是可以参考的。欲求春小麦大面积亩产达到一千多斤，每亩播种二十二斤，显然是少了一些。每斤麦种以平均一万五千粒计算，二十二斤播种量约合三十三万粒，如整地质量欠好，或发芽率不足90％，实际每亩出苗数可能在三十万株以下，欲求达到四十万到八十万穗是不太容易的。同时，每亩超过四十五斤到五十斤也没有必要，因为在大面积上整地、施肥、灌溉等条件是受一定限制的，这些条件跟不上，反而会造成减产的危险；播种量过多了，也会造成种子供应的紧张局面和种子的浪费现象。
    根据以上情况的分析，欲求达到大面积上亩产春小麦一千多斤，每亩播种量定在三十斤到五十斤，每亩达到四十万到八十万穗较为妥当。各地可以根据地区特点及整地、施肥、灌溉、品种等具体情况，选择最合适的播种量。
    在增加播种量的同时，还必须作到窄行匀播，保证全苗壮苗，才能使密植起到应有的增产作用。马拉播种机不论在东北或西北春麦区已肯定为达到窄行匀播的最好工具。通过1958年十四个春小麦丰产经验的调查，行距一般在七点五厘米到十五厘米之间，以十厘米左右较为普遍。行距过大，不能充分利用地力；行距过小，往往由于整地质量难以保证，引起缺苗断垅。
    在所调查的十四处丰产经验中，有七处采用了交叉播种的方法，它可以使麦种分布得更为均匀，不至挤在一条线上，因而扩大了土地利用面积和增加了光能利用效率。但春小麦适期播种的时间很短，在播种适期范围内，必须争取在最短时间内突击完成播种工作。交叉播种，工作量增加一倍，在劳畜力许可的情况下是可以提倡的。
    适期早播，在短期内突击抢种完毕。
    播种期的早晚对于春小麦的产量起着极为重要的作用，在土壤化冻至足够播种深度时，应即抓紧时间突击抢播。因为春小麦穗原始体分化时间的长短与温度高低的关系至为密切，播种期早，麦苗生育得早，穗原始体分化时期温度较低，分化时间延长，穗子就有可能分化得长大些；反之播种期晚，麦苗生育也晚，等到穗原始体分化时期气温迅速上升，促使穗原始体缩短分化的时间，穗子也就可能变得短而小了。
    春小麦提前播种还可以相对地提早成熟期，对于避免东北地区因雨季来临所造成的收割困难和西北地区的早霜危害，也是很有利的。
    春小麦虽然以尽可能提早播种为原则，但据青海赛什克农场和黑龙江北安地区一些国营农场的经验，春小麦过早播种也不一定有利。原因是播种过早气温和土温均较低，出苗时间长，出苗后表现纤细黄弱，生长欠壮。有时出苗过早，遇到气温骤然剧烈下降，也易遭受冻害，因此春小麦应该争取在适当时期提早播种。春季气温上升很快，所谓春小麦播种的适宜时间极短，必须在春小麦适合播种的时间内，动员一切力量，突击抢种，切不可拖延时日，错过春小麦播种的适期，以致造成减产的损失。
    选用良种，发掘当地品种的潜力，积极培育新的良种和加强引种，克服品种单一化现象。
    通过1958年的春小麦丰产经验总结，可以看出选用良种是保证增产的重要措施之一。特别在采用了密植、深耕、增施肥料等措施后，生产水平大为提高，在这种情况下，良种的优越性显得更为突出。反之，同样一个良种如不具备优越的栽培条件，也难望发挥其丰产潜力，因此所谓良种必须结合具体栽培条件来说。各地区在选用良种时，除注意其丰产性外，还必须对该品种的其他特性进行详细的分析。针对当地春小麦生产上存在的主要问题，分别选用具有秆强、抗病、口紧、早熟等特性的品种。指望一个品种具备所有的优良性状是不现实的。但选用的良种必须有助于解决当地生产上存在的主要问题，以达到稳定丰产的目的，这一点是十分重要的。
    东北春麦区历年秆锈病为害严重，应该特别注意选用抗秆锈病的品种。西北春麦区生产水平较高，生长期较短，早霜为害的危险性较大，除个别地区外，秆锈病威胁不大，应该注意选用早熟、秆强的品种。除农家品种外，目前推广的良种，在西北地区有甘肃96、碧玉麦、武功774、三联二号，南大2419等，在东北地区有甘肃96、松花江一号、合作2号、3号、4号、5号、6号。此外有些新的抗病杂交良种即将推广。
    总的说来，目前春麦区的良种数目还是不多的，过去选种工作未能很好地适应生产发展的需要，自然地形成了品种单一化的现象，对于保证春小麦产量的稳定性极为不利，这个问题必须及时引起应有的重视。
