    A Good Investigative Report
    The People's Daily published an article by Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, entitled "Investigation Report on the Humen Commune" on February 25th. I think this investigative report is very good and has its unique features. In the past, most general investigation reports analyzed problems based on statistical figures, while fewer paid attention to proposing solutions to the problems discovered during the investigation. This investigative report, however, devoted considerable space to analyzing problems and proposing solutions. From this investigative report, we not only see the tremendous advantages of the people's communes but also see how the responsible comrades of the provincial party committee go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation.

    一篇好的调查报告
    人民日报2月25日发表了中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志的“虎门公社调查报告”一文。我觉得这篇调查报告很好，有它的独特的地方。过去一般的调查报告就统计数字分析问题的较多，而注意就调查中发现的问题提出解决办法的较少。这篇调查报告却用了相当多的篇幅来分析问题并提出解决问题的办法。从这篇调查报告中，我们不仅看到了人民公社的巨大优越性，也看到了省委负责同志怎样深入基层了解情况。　　　　　　　　　　　　曾声文
