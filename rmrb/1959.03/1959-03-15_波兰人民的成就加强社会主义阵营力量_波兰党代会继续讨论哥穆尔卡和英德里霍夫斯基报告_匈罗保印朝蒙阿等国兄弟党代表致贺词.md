Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 13th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party has entered its fourth day. At the morning session today, delegates continued to speak and discuss the reports by Gomulka and Jedrychowski.

    Albrecht, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke first, saying that this congress fully demonstrates the party's power of unity. The new national economic development plan formulated by the party will greatly strengthen Poland's economic strength and improve the people's living standards.

    Albrecht mainly discussed how to maximize the effectiveness of basic investment. He reminded the congress to pay attention to three issues: the coordination of basic investment plans, reducing the proportion of construction and installation costs in basic investment, and housing and social construction. He finally called for strengthening the sense of responsibility of leading cadres at all levels of the national economy.

    Mahn, First Secretary of the Gdansk Provincial Committee, spoke next. He gave a detailed analysis of Gdansk's economic development plan, emphasizing that this plan could be greatly overfulfilled. He said that in the discussions before the congress, the masses put forward more than 7,000 valuable suggestions, and implementing these suggestions could produce 700 million zlotys worth of products for the country. The wide participation of the masses in the discussions proves their support for the party's plans.

    Marosan, head of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress at the morning session on the 13th. He said, "We have learned with genuine joy and satisfaction of the achievements made by the Polish people under the leadership of the United Workers' Party, as announced at the congress. These achievements have strengthened the socialist camp."

    Borila, head of the Romanian Workers' Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, then delivered a congratulatory message to the congress. He said that the Romanian people are happy for the achievements of the Polish people. They stand with the Polish people. He said that all attempts by the Yugoslav modern revisionists to undermine the unity of the socialist camp have been met with ignominious failure. The unity of all parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism is unshakable.

    Jaroszewicz, Deputy Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, spoke specifically about the issue of economic cooperation between socialist countries in his speech. He believes that developing this cooperation is a fundamental and necessary condition for Poland to carry out socialist construction. He said that in formulating Poland's economic development plan, the economic, technical, and scientific cooperation and international division of labor between fraternal countries should be taken into account, and the great potential in this area should be considered.

    Wieczorek, First Secretary of the Zielona Gora Provincial Committee, spoke at the congress about the economic construction achievements and future plans of the province. He pointed out that the party and government are giving increasing attention to the continued development of this western recovered territory. In the next seven years, the light and heavy industrial production of our province will more than double, and the chemical industry will grow more than three times. He also said that the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and the maintenance of the Oder-Neisse border will have a positive impact on the economic development of our province.

    Kruczek, First Secretary of the Rzeszow Provincial Committee, spoke after the representative of the Poznan Cegielski Factory, emphasizing the great achievements made by the country and Rzeszow Province in the past fourteen years. He said that emphasizing this point is important because the revisionists, under the pretext of criticizing errors in work, negate the achievements of past work.

    Kruczek also talked about agricultural issues. He believes that various forms of cooperation, including agricultural cooperatives, should be developed, and peasants should be explained to, so that they understand the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. He said that emphasizing the principle of voluntariness does not mean not doing work. He believes that ideological work should be strengthened, socialist propaganda should be strengthened, and the construction experience of the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries should be introduced.

    Staikov, head of the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation and member of the Central Political Bureau, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress. When he spoke about the great achievements Bulgaria has made in agricultural collectivization, the audience responded with warm applause.

    Staikov pointed out that the attempts of modern revisionists to undermine the unity of socialist countries have been met with ignominious failure. They have fallen into complete isolation. He emphasized that we should cherish the unity of the socialist camp as we protect our own eyes.

    The congratulatory message from Ahmed, head of the Indian Communist Party delegation, was also warmly welcomed. He said to the delegates: "You have made great achievements in socialist construction, and have also made great contributions to the socialist family. The unity of socialist countries is peace, national liberation, and socialism will achieve greater achievements in the victory of socialism throughout the world.

    The morning session ended here. In the afternoon, the meeting will continue.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 13th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued in the afternoon of the 13th to discuss the reports of Gomulka and Jedrychowski. Seven representatives spoke at the meeting.

    Maretz, First Secretary of the Bydgoszcz Provincial Committee, spoke first. He talked about the production achievements and development prospects of the province, emphasizing that the party should closely contact the masses and promote the party's policies to the masses.

    Wachowicz, First Secretary of the Kielce Provincial Committee, spoke next. He said, "We have carried out a sharp and uncompromising struggle against revisionism, and we have also opposed dogmatism and backward forces, strengthening the unity of the party and the connection between the party and the masses."

    Wachowicz also said that after discussions, the masses in Kielce Province decided to increase the growth of labor productivity from the originally planned 49% to 63%.

    Jabłonski, Scientific Secretary of the Polish Academy of Sciences, expressed his complete agreement with the party's policy on science and culture in his speech. He reported on the situation in Polish science and the connection between scientists and practical life, and reported on the contribution of Polish scientists to the cause of socialist construction.

    Jabłonski pointed out that Polish scientists are eager to more closely link scientific activities with socialist construction and with the politics of the people's country.

    Michkiewicz, First Secretary of the Lodz Provincial Committee, spoke about issues such as industrial distribution, developing small and medium-sized enterprises, and organizing handicraft production cooperatives.

    Strenko, representative of the "Paris Commune" Shipyard, said in his speech, "Our factory plans to increase production threefold and increase labor productivity by 80% from 1959 to 1965, but we believe that this indicator can still be improved."

    Park Kum-chul, head of the Korean Workers' Party delegation, spoke in his congratulatory message about the construction achievements of the Korean people and the support of the Polish people for North Korea, and expressed his gratitude for this support.

    He finally emphasized that socialist countries are united in opposing revisionism and advancing together under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    Molomzhamts, head of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party delegation, spoke in his congratulatory message about the great significance of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. He said that we will continue to strengthen unity and friendship with all fraternal countries, resolutely fight against revisionism, and fight against all enemies of socialism.

    S. Kolega, head of the Albanian Labor Party delegation, said that the Yugoslav revisionists tried to separate us from the socialist camp, but the people of our country stand like a mountain on the position of unity and friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Every member of the socialist family is united like one person in the struggle for peace and socialism.
