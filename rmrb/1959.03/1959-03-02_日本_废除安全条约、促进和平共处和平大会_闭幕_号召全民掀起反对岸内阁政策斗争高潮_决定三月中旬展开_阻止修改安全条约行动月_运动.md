Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th -- The "Abolish the Security Treaty, Promote Peaceful Coexistence Peace Conference" in Japan concluded its two-day meeting, victoriously closing on the evening of the 28th.

    On the morning of the 28th, the conference split into three groups: banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, preventing nuclear armament, and abolishing the Japan-US "Security Treaty"; abolishing the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and international friendship; and safeguarding democracy and rights. They held lively discussions on the current tasks of Japan's peace forces.

    The conference held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 28th, passing resolutions, requests, appeals, and a conference declaration.

    At the conference, congratulatory telegrams from the China Peace Committee and five other organizations were read, and all attendees warmly applauded.

    The conference also passed a resolution, sending telegrams to the people of Cameroon, Panama, the Belgian Congo, Central Africa, Cuba, and Algeria, expressing support for their struggle for national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th -- The "Abolish the Security Treaty, Promote Peaceful Coexistence Peace Conference" in Japan unanimously passed a resolution on opening up Japan-China relations and restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations on the 28th.

    The resolution condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government's hostile policy towards China, as demonstrated by its attempt to revise the "Security Treaty." The resolution pointed out that while pursuing a hostile policy towards China, the Kishida Nobusuke government is spreading fallacies about restoring Japan-China trade, which is an insult to the people of both Japan and China.

    The resolution stated that the participants in the conference will do everything in their power to strive for the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and the Japan-Chiang treaty, the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, and the crushing of the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

    The conference also passed a resolution on concentrating peace and democratic forces and strengthening action.

    The resolution stated that all participants unanimously affirmed that Japan is currently at a crucial juncture of choosing between two paths: one is to allow the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty," placing the fate of the Japanese nation in the hands of the United States and the Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet; the other is to prevent the revision of this treaty and open up a path towards neutrality and peaceful coexistence.

    The resolution pointed out that the time has come for all people who are uneasy about the Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet's policies and demand Japan's security and peace in Asia to strengthen unity and rise up to launch a struggle.

    The resolution stipulates that March 15th to April 15th will be "Action Month to Stop Revision of the Security Treaty." The resolution calls for the following powerful actions to be launched during this action month: in all posts and regions, explain the spirit of the declaration and resolutions of this peace conference to the masses, expose the dangerous essence of the Japan-US "Security Treaty," launch a campaign to collect signatures and opinions, and hold various gatherings of all sizes. The resolution also calls on all sectors to prepare for a wave of national struggle including worker strikes at the end of March in order to form a climax of the action month. The resolution believes that this action month is of great significance for promoting the development of Japan's peace and democratic movement in the future, preventing the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty," and leading Japan towards neutrality and peaceful coexistence.

    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本“废除安全条约、促进和平共处和平大会”结束了为期两天的会议，在28日晚间胜利闭幕。
    大会在28日上午分为禁止原子弹和氢弹、阻止核武装、废除日美“安全条约”；废除日美“安全条约”与国际友好；维护民主与权利三个小组，热烈讨论了日本和平力量当前的任务问题。
    大会在28日下午举行了全体会议，通过了决议、要求书、呼吁书和大会宣言。
    在大会上宣读了中国保卫世界和平委员会等五个团体致大会的贺电，全体到会者热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    大会还通过决议，致电喀麦隆、巴拿马、比属刚果、中非、古巴、阿尔及利亚人民，表示支持他们为争取民族独立的斗争。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本“废除安全条约、促进和平共处和平大会”在28日一致通过了关于打开日中关系、恢复日中邦交的决议。
    决议谴责岸信介政府由于企图修改“安全条约”而表现出来的敌视中国的政策。决议指出，岸信介政府一方面实行敌视中国的政策，另一方面却散布关于恢复日中贸易的谬论，这是对日中两国人民的侮辱。
    决议说，参加大会的人们将竭尽全力为争取废除日美“安全条约”和日蒋条约、恢复日中邦交、粉碎制造“两个中国”的阴谋而斗争。
    大会还通过了关于集中和平、民主力量和加强行动的决议。
    决议说，全体与会者一致确认日本目前处于选择两条道路的重要关头：一条是容许修改日美“安全条约”，把日本民族的命运放在美国和岸信介内阁手里的道路；另一条是阻止修改这项条约，开辟通往中立、和平共处的方向的道路。
    决议指出，对岸信介内阁的政策感到不安、要求日本的安全和亚洲的和平的一切人民加强团结，站起来展开斗争的时候已经到来了。
    决议规定从3月15日到4月15日为“阻止修改安全条约行动月”。决议号召在这个行动月里展开下列强有力的行动：在所有的岗位、地区向群众阐明这次和平大会的宣言和决议的精神，揭穿日美“安全条约”的危险本质，展开征集签名和意见的运动，举行大小各种集会。决议同时号召各界准备在3月底掀起包括工人罢工在内的全民斗争的浪潮，以便形成行动月的高潮。决议认为，这个行动月对于促使今后日本和平、民主运动发展，阻止修改日美“安全条约”，使日本走向中立和和平共处方向，有重要意义。
