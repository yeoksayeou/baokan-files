Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 17th: At the afternoon session of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on the 17th, the heads of the Tunisian Communist Party delegation and the Moroccan Communist Party delegation expressed their hopes for the unity of Arab countries in their congratulatory speeches to the Congress.

The head of the Tunisian Communist Party delegation, Ben Mustapha Abdel Hamid, said that the Tunisian Communist Party is fighting for Arab unity. The Tunisian Communist Party opposes all tendencies that weaken this unity, first and foremost the United Arab Republic's anti-communist and anti-Iraqi actions. We will fight alongside the Iraqi Communist Party.

The head of the Moroccan Communist Party delegation, Abdallah Layashi, said that the Moroccan Communist Party supports the unity and solidarity of the Arab nation. The Moroccan Communist Party believes that its most glorious task is to strengthen the unity of the Arab people. The Iraqi revolution has opened up the path for the Arab people to fight for freedom, democracy, and independence, and all Arab people will unite with the Iraqi people against imperialist intervention.

The heads of these two fraternal party delegations also spoke about the struggles in their respective countries in their speeches.

Ben Mustapha Abdel Hamid said that Tunisia has made great achievements since its independence, but the struggle against imperialism has not ended. Our party supports the government in establishing cooperative relations with socialist countries, and we hope that the government will adopt a foreign policy based on the Bandung Principles.

Abdallah Layashi said that the struggle for independence and democracy is the most urgent task put forward by the Moroccan Communist Party. We are fighting for the withdrawal of US military bases and for the recovery of Moroccan territories occupied by France and Spain. He also said that the Algerian colonial war threatens the independence of Tunisia and Morocco, and poses a threat to world peace. Our party is also fighting to end this war.

    突尼斯共产党和摩洛哥共产党领导人指出
    阿拉伯人民同伊拉克人民站在一起  阿联反伊反共作法削弱阿拉伯团结
    新华社华沙17日电　在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会17日下午会议上，突尼斯共产党代表团团长和摩洛哥共产党代表团团长在向大会致祝词时谈到了他们对阿拉伯国家团结的期望。
    突尼斯共产党代表团团长本·穆斯塔法·阿卜杜勒·哈米德说，突尼斯共产党为阿拉伯的团结而斗争。突尼斯共产党反对一切削弱这种团结的倾向，首先是反对阿拉伯联合共和国反共、反伊拉克的作法。我们将与伊拉克共产党并肩斗争。
    摩洛哥共产党代表团团长阿卜杜拉·拉雅希说，摩洛哥共产党支持阿拉伯民族的统一和团结。摩洛哥共产党认为自己的最光荣的任务就是加强阿拉伯人民的团结。伊拉克革命为阿拉伯人民开辟了争取自由、民主和独立的道路，所有阿拉伯人民将同伊拉克人民团结在一起反对帝国主义的干涉。
    这两位兄弟党代表团团长在致词中还谈到他们本国的斗争情况。
    本·穆斯塔法·阿卜杜勒·哈米德说，突尼斯自从独立以来已取得很大成就，但是，反对帝国主义的斗争并未结束。我们党支持政府与社会主义国家建立合作关系，我们希望政府采取基于万隆原则的外交政策。
    阿卜杜拉·拉雅希说，为独立和民主进行斗争是摩洛哥共产党提出的最迫切的任务。我们正在为撤消美军基地、为收回被法国和西班牙占领的摩洛哥领土而斗争。他还说，阿尔及利亚殖民战争威胁着突尼斯和摩洛哥的独立，造成对世界和平的威胁，我们党也正为结束这一战争而斗争。
