Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 11th -- Eight staff members of the United Arab Republic's Embassy in the Republic of Iraq, headed by Embassy Counselor Ahmed Misri, returned to Cairo from Baghdad on the afternoon of the 10th.

According to the Middle East News Agency today, the eight staff members of the UAE Embassy returned to Cairo because the government of the Republic of Iraq considered their continued presence in the Republic of Iraq undesirable. According to Cairo Radio, the government of the Republic of Iraq demanded on the 10th that ten staff members of the UAE Embassy (including the UAE's military attaché to the Republic of Iraq and the embassy's press attache) leave the country within twenty-four hours.

Reports say that the UAE's military attache to the Republic of Iraq, Abdul Magig Farid, is currently in Damascus.

UAE Ambassador to Iraq, Said Fahmi, had returned to the UAE before the Mosul rebellion occurred.

Furthermore, according to a Middle East News Agency dispatch from Damascus, the agency's Baghdad branch was closed on the 10th by order of the Iraqi government's military governor.

    伊拉克政府要求
    一批阿联外交人员离境
    新华社开罗11日电　以大使馆参赞艾哈迈德·米斯里为首的阿拉伯联合共和国驻伊拉克共和国大使馆的八名工作人员已经在10日下午从巴格达回到开罗。
    据中东通讯社今天报道，阿联大使馆的这八名工作人员回到开罗，是因为伊拉克共和国政府认为他们留在伊拉克共和国境内是不受欢迎的。据开罗电台报道，伊拉克共和国政府在10日要求阿联大使馆的十名工作人员（其中包括阿联驻伊拉克共和国的武官和大使馆新闻专员）在二十四小时内离开这个国家。
    有消息说，阿联驻伊拉克共和国武官阿卜杜勒·马吉格·法里德目前在大马士革。
    阿联驻伊拉克大使赛义德·法赫米已在摩苏尔叛乱发生前回到阿联。
    又据中东通讯社从大马士革发出的消息说，这家通讯社驻巴格达分社已在伊拉克政府军事长官命令下于10日被封闭。
