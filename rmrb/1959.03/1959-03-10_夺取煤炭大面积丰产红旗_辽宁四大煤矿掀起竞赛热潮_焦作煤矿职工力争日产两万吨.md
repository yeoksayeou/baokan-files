Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 9th: Workers in the four major state-owned coal mines in Liaoning Province are enthusiastically launching a red banner competition movement for large-scale bumper harvests.

In the first week of March, raw coal production has been rising steadily, with an average daily output increase of 18.6% compared to the average daily output in February.

After the National Coal Mine Workers Red Banner Competition Broadcast Rally, workers in the four major coal mines of Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao in Liaoning Province are all energetic and high-spirited. At the mobilization rallies held in many mining areas, workers put forward action slogans to advance towards shift outputs of 500, 800, and 1,000 tons, guaranteeing the overfulfillment of the coal production task for the first quarter. In the first seven days of March, the Fushun Coal Mine, which proposed the competition initiative to the national coal mines, and the Fuxin Coal Mine, which immediately responded to the challenge, saw a very heated red banner competition. By the seventh day, Fushun Mine maintained a slight lead with an average daily output of 50,093 tons; however, the workers of Fuxin Coal Mine are determined to overtake Fushun Mine.

In this red banner competition, while focusing on coal mining, the various mining bureaus are also closely following up with production preparation and auxiliary work, thus ensuring the continuous growth of coal mining volume. After overcoming the past weakness of tunneling not keeping up with coal mining, the Beipiao Mining Bureau achieved an average daily tunneling progress of 433 meters in the first seven days of March, completing 114% of the plan, thus ensuring that the entire mine broke the 10,000-ton mark every day in the first week, with daily coal production increasing by 26% compared to February.

After the launch of the competition movement, technical revolution has begun to become the central content. The mines in the Fushun mining area are universally promoting the experience of drilling deep holes and using large-scale blasting, which proved effective in the Great Leap Forward last year. After implementing the coal mining method of drilling deep holes and multiple blasting at one time in the third district of Longfeng Mine, a record of 2,000 tons of daily output was created on the 4th. Workers in various mines are actively improving production labor organization and coal mining methods, making coal production increase exponentially.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiaozuo: Under the slogan of striving to achieve a large-scale bumper harvest and ensuring that the average daily output level in March is a quarter higher than last month, reaching 20,000 tons, the workers of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine have launched a competition upsurge.

Accelerating tunneling speed and increasing coal production per unit area are important keys to ensuring the improvement of daily output level. Therefore, all workers in the mine guarantee to create nine to eleven working faces with a daily output of 1,000 tons of coal and fifty tunneling teams with a daily progress of two meters by mid-March. Around this goal, all workers in the mine have launched a red banner competition. The two tunneling teams of Si Yancai and Ren Xiaosuo in Xiaomacun Mine have now reached the target of two meters of daily progress due to the flexible application of advanced operating methods of deep-hole blasting and shallow-hole multi-cycle blasting. The workers in the first mining area of Wangfeng Mine have adopted methods such as mining while releasing the roof and four-shift cross-operation, and in recent days, the daily output on the 80-meter working face has reached more than 900 tons, and they are currently advancing towards the goal of 1,000 tons per day.

### 夺取煤炭大面积丰产红旗  辽宁四大煤矿掀起竞赛热潮　焦作煤矿职工力争日产两万吨

    夺取煤炭大面积丰产红旗
    辽宁四大煤矿掀起竞赛热潮　焦作煤矿职工力争日产两万吨
    据新华社沈阳9日电　辽宁省四大国营煤矿职工正在热烈展开大面积丰产的红旗竞赛运动。
    在3月份开始的第一周，原煤产量已经节节上升，平均日产量比2月份平均日产量增加了18.6％。
    全国煤矿职工红旗竞赛广播大会之后，辽宁省抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票四大煤矿的职工，个个神采奕奕，斗志昂扬，在许多矿区召开的比武誓师大会上，工人们提出了向班产五百、八百、一千吨前进的行动口号，保证超额完成第一季度的煤炭生产任务。3月份头七天，向全国煤矿提出竞赛倡议的抚顺煤矿和立即应战的阜新煤矿，红旗竞赛十分热烈。到第七天，抚顺矿以平均日产五万零九十三吨的成绩，稍稍保持领先地位；但阜新煤矿职工决心赶过抚顺矿。
    在这次红旗竞赛中，各矿务局在大抓采煤的同时，生产准备和辅助工作也紧紧跟上，因而保证了采煤量不断增长。北票矿务局在克服了过去掘进跟不上采煤的薄弱环节之后，3月份头七天掘进平均日进度达到四百三十三公尺，完成计划114％，因而保证了全矿第一周天天突破万吨关，日产煤量比2月份提高26％。
    竞赛运动展开以后，技术革命已开始成为中心内容。抚顺矿区各矿正在普遍推广去年大跃进中行之有效的打深眼、放大炮的经验。龙凤矿三区实行打深眼、一次多放炮的采煤方法后，4日曾创造了日产两千吨的纪录。各矿的工人们纷纷改进生产劳动组织和采煤方法，使煤炭产量成倍地增长。
    据新华社焦作讯　焦作煤矿职工在为实现大面积丰收、保证3月份平均日产水平比上月提高四分之一达到两万吨而奋斗的口号下，掀起了竞赛热潮。
    加快掘进速度、提高采煤单位面积产量，是保证提高日产水平的重要关键。因此，全矿职工保证在3月中旬创造九个到十一个日产千吨煤的工作面、五十个日进两公尺的掘进小组，围绕这一奋斗目标，全矿职工已展开红旗竞赛。小马村矿的司延材、任小锁两个掘进组，由于灵活地运用深孔爆破和浅孔多循环的先进操作方法，现在已经达到了日进两公尺的指标。王封矿一采区的职工由于采用了边采煤边放顶和四班交叉作业等方法，这几天在八十公尺的工作面上日产已经达到九百多吨，目前正在向日产千吨的目标挺进。（附图片）
