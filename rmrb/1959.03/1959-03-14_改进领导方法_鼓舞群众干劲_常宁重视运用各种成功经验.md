Improving Leadership Methods and Inspiring Mass Enthusiasm
Changning Attaches Importance to Using Various Successful Experiences

(Our reporter Gong Jie reports) The Changning County Party Committee and cadres in Hunan Province, while leading spring plowing production, have been using a whole set of experiences accumulated during the Great Leap Forward last year to launch a high tide of mass movement.

In last year's Great Leap Forward in production, Changning County accumulated rich experience in leadership methods. For example, putting politics in command, holding on-site meetings, conducting comparisons, competitions, and visits, engaging in experimental fields, participating in production to lead production, and grasping both ends to bring along the middle – all these are good methods for implementing the mass line. Applying and developing these experiences in this year's production campaign is an important condition for ensuring a greater and more comprehensive leap forward. Therefore, the County Party Committee requires all Commune Party Committees and cadres to continue to boldly mobilize the masses and vigorously launch mass movements this year.

The vast majority of Commune Party Committees and cadres have a correct understanding of last year's Great Leap Forward. According to the requirements of the County Party Committee, they have correctly applied last year's experience to this year's work. Therefore, the spring plowing started off vigorously there from the beginning.

On January 22nd, the County Party Committee held an on-site meeting on fertilizer accumulation in Yintian Commune. The leading cadres of Yintian Commune, from the very beginning of preparations for plowing, used last year's set of experiences in vigorously launching mass movements. In just over a month, they organized two competitions centered on fertilizer accumulation and deep plowing, and held an on-site meeting. Production was carried out vigorously. In particular, the Shang'an Brigade, around January 20th, had already plowed all the paddy fields, and most of the fields were dotted with fertilizer pits, each pit full of fertilizer. The field ridges were trimmed on three sides, and thick smoke from burning soil ash was everywhere on the mountains and ridges. People were everywhere, and fertilizer was everywhere. Cadres and the masses were full of enthusiasm. At that time, the entire brigade had already accumulated more than 300 dan of fertilizer per mu. After discovering this "thoroughbred horse," the County Party Committee immediately held an on-site meeting here attended by more than 600 people, including branch secretaries and above from the entire county and some team leaders. This meeting made everyone further realize that as long as they mustered enough energy and used the methods of vigorously launching mass movements in 1958, it was entirely possible to achieve a greater leap forward this year. Some people who had only seen difficulties and had doubts before also increased their confidence after visiting the Shang'an Brigade. Some people who had more or less complacent feelings also quickly caught up. Mao Sanyuan, the secretary of the Guanyang Commune Party Committee, after returning to the Dalu Brigade under his responsibility after the on-site meeting, immediately led the team's cadres to contract specific areas and mobilize the masses. After ten days of hard work, the team's production jumped from the second to last place to the first place.

This on-site meeting not only set off a spring plowing upsurge centered on fertilizer accumulation throughout the county to catch up with Shang'an and compete with Shang'an, but also further recognized the great significance of summing up and applying the leadership method experience in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the spring plowing preparation work, the County Party Committee and the Commune Party Committees correctly used methods such as visiting, comparing, competing, engaging in experimental fields, leading production with production, and grasping both ends to bring along the middle to vigorously launch mass movements.

In order to better carry out inspection, comparison, and competition in this year's production Great Leap Forward, the county's fifteen communes were divided into five competition groups, with monthly comparisons within the groups. According to the production season, four county-wide comparisons are carried out throughout the year. Since January 20th, the county's fifteen communes have organized sixty-two comparisons, visits, and on-site meetings, and more than 150 brigades have organized 484 comparisons, visits, and on-site meetings. The enthusiasm of the masses is increasing day by day.

In spring plowing production, more than 95% of the county's cadres insist on engaging in experimental fields and participating in production to lead production. In order to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, the County Party Committee has also transferred nearly 200 cadres from county-level organs, and the communes have transferred more than 600 cadres to work in production teams.

Because the Party Committees and cadres at all levels in Changning County have used the accumulated experience of vigorously launching mass movements, the spring plowing production movement centered on fertilizer accumulation has been enthusiastically launched. At present, the county has accumulated more than 300 dan of high-quality fertilizer per mu of paddy fields, all the paddy fields have been plowed, and the 50,000 mu of rapeseed and wheat are being top-dressed with the second application of fertilizer, and are generally growing well. Cadres and the masses throughout the county are full of confidence and are striving for a greater leap forward this year.

    改进领导方法　鼓舞群众干劲
    常宁重视运用各种成功经验
    本报讯　记者龚杰报道：湖南省常宁县党委和干部在领导春耕生产中，运用去年大跃进中积累的一整套发动群众的经验，掀起了群众运动的高潮。
    常宁县在去年的生产大跃进中，在领导方法方面积累了丰富的经验，比如政治挂帅，开现场会，评比竞赛参观，搞试验田参加生产领导生产，抓两头带中间，所有这些都是贯彻执行群众路线的好办法，在今年的生产运动中运用和发展这些经验，是保证更大更全面跃进的重要条件。因此县委要求各公社党委和干部今年继续放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。
    各公社党委和干部中，绝大部分对去年的大跃进有正确的认识，他们根据县委的要求，把去年的经验正确地运用到今年的工作中，因此那里的春耕一开始就搞得轰轰烈烈。
    1月22日县委在荫田公社召开了一次积肥现场会议。荫田公社的领导干部，备耕一开始就运用了去年一套大搞群众运动的经验，一个多月中，就组织了以积肥、深耕为中心的两次评比，开了一次现场会议，生产搞得轰轰烈烈，特别是上安大队，1月20日左右，板田就已全部犁翻，大部分田里，肥凼星罗棋布，凼凼肥满，田塍刨得三面光，遍山遍岭是烧火土灰的浓烟，满山是人，到处是肥。干部、群众干劲冲天。当时全大队每亩积肥已达三百多担。县委发现这个“千里马”后，立即在这里召开了全县分支书记以上干部和一部分队长参加的六百多人的现场会议。这次会议使大家进一步认识了只要鼓足干劲，运用1958年大搞群众运动的方法，实现今年更大跃进，是完全有把握的。原来一些只看到困难、有怀疑情绪的人，参观了上安大队以后，也增强了信心。原来一些多少有自满情绪的人也急起直追。官阳公社党委书记毛三元，开完现场会回到自己分工领导的大禄大队，立即带领队里干部，分片包干，发动群众，苦战十天，全队生产由原来的倒数第二位，跃居第一。
    这次现场会议，不仅在全县范围内掀起了赶上安、赛上安的以积肥为中心的春耕热潮，全县干部也进一步认识了总结和运用1958年大跃进中领导方法经验的重大意义。在春耕备耕工作中，县委和各公社党委就正确地运用了参观评比竞赛，搞试验田，以生产领导生产，抓两头带中间等大搞群众运动的方法。
    为了在今年的生产大跃进中，更好地开展检查、评比、竞赛，全县十五个公社分了五个竞赛片，片里每月评比一次。根据生产季节，一年开展四次全县性的大评比。1月20日以来，全县十五个公社组织过六十二次评比参观和现场会，一百五十多个大队组织过四百八十四次评比参观和现场会，群众干劲一天比一天高。
    在春耕生产中，全县95％以上的干部坚持搞试验田，参加生产领导生产。为了加强基层的领导，县委还从县级机关下放了近两百名干部，公社下放了六百多干部到生产队工作。
    常宁县各级党委和干部由于运用了积累下来的大搞群众运动的经验，以积肥为中心的春耕生产运动已经火热展开，目前全县每亩稻田已积优质肥料三百多担，板田已经全部犁翻，五万亩油菜和麦子正在追施第二次肥料，一般生长良好。全县干部和群众正满怀信心为争取今年的更大跃进而奋斗。
