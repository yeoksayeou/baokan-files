Last June, the Nanping City Education Bureau in Fujian conducted a random test of primary schools throughout the city. A four-grade combined single-teacher primary school achieved an average score of over 80 in both Chinese language and arithmetic, ranking first among primary schools in the city. In recent years, many teachers from other places have visited this primary school. When they saw the students' good self-discipline, neat and well-written assignments, rich and vivid compositions, as well as the students' correct and fluent reading and accurate language expression skills, everyone praised the teaching quality of this school. This school is the Taxia Primary School in the suburbs of Nanping.

The high teaching quality of Taxia Primary School is inseparable from the hard work of teacher Chen Meigui. In order to enable the children to acquire more and better knowledge, she poured all her efforts into it.

When Chen Meigui first arrived at Taxia Primary School in 1954, the students quarreled in class and fought after class, and the school discipline was very chaotic. Due to the lack of discipline, the students' learning quality was very low. Some first-grade students couldn't even write their own names, and they often mixed up the order when counting from one to ten. "We must find every way to educate the children well!" Recalling the instructions of the Party Branch Secretary and the principal of the school district on work, and the parents' ardent expectations for the school, a strong sense of work responsibility often made her think hard into the late night. At first, she thought: her own cultural level is not even as good as a junior normal school graduate, and she lacks combined teaching experience, so how can she teach the children well? But then she thought of the support of the Party and the masses, and she made up her mind: she must overcome all difficulties and teach the children well.

Braving the wind and rain of early spring, she ran through several surrounding natural villages, visiting door to door. With the help of the township cadres, she finally mobilized all school-age children to enroll. In the first few days, she told the students stories about revolutionary leaders loving learning, educating them on the purpose of learning, teaching children to sing and dance, so that they developed feelings for the school and teachers, and aroused their strong desire to study. Truancy slowly disappeared.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of teaching, Chen Meigui attached great importance to educating students in self-discipline from the beginning. Because of her genuine love for children, she has always insisted on the educational method of positive enlightenment and patient persuasion. There was a child surnamed Lin in the first grade who was irritable and beat people at every turn. The order of the class was often disrupted by him. Chen Meigui was so anxious that she almost cried several times. However, she did not punish him casually. From careful observation in peacetime, she found that this peasant child had a very simple and straightforward character, had organizational skills, and loved listening to stories, so she looked for opportunities to get close to him and told him stories of unity and friendship in revolutionary struggles. Once, after listening to the story of the volunteers selflessly rescuing the Korean people, he was so moved that he shed tears. He told the teacher that he wanted to learn from the example of the volunteer uncles and be friendly to his classmates. In class activities, Chen Meigui appointed him as the captain, which greatly encouraged his enthusiasm. As a "leader," of course, he had to lead by example, so he no longer bullied his classmates, and often helped the younger ones! Because Chen Meigui respected children and loved children, the children listened to her teachings very much, some school rules were gradually established, and self-discipline in the school was also formed.

In order to enable children to acquire deep and solid knowledge, Chen Meigui paid a huge price for each lesson. For four years, she has never stepped into the classroom without preparing a lesson plan, and she attaches great importance to studying teaching materials. In language teaching and daily life, she pays attention to linking with current political movements to improve the socialist and communist consciousness of the younger generation. In teaching, Chen Meigui especially attaches importance to conducting intuitive teaching through demonstrations, experiments, and observations. She must find a way to do everything that can let students see, touch, smell, and do. For example, when the third grade read the lesson "Gargle," in order to prove the principle that limestone will become soft under the erosion of acetic acid, she did an experiment of soaking eggs in vinegar to make them soft, so that students understood and believed this difficult scientific principle.

Taxia Primary School is a four-grade combined single-teacher school. Chen Meigui has to be familiar with the teaching materials of eight subjects in Chinese and arithmetic in four grades every day. She has to look at sixteen textbooks and reference materials every day to prepare lessons, and she has to deal with more than one hundred students' written assignments. In addition to teaching, she also has to conduct correspondence learning and participate in literacy work. Moreover, Chen Meigui is a mother of four children, and cumbersome housework often takes up a lot of time. In order to solve the contradiction between many tasks and insufficient time, Chen Meigui pays great attention to rationally and scientifically allocating time, improving work efficiency, and not wasting a minute. She uses the winter and summer vacations of each semester to study the teaching materials, determine the key points of the teaching materials, and formulate teaching progress according to the requirements of the teaching syllabus and the actual level of the students. After class, she uses Saturday or Sunday to become familiar with the teaching materials for the next week, and determines the teaching purpose of each lesson. In this way, she only needs to study the teaching materials a little bit when preparing lessons on weekdays to grasp the teaching materials. She has arranged a strict schedule for her daily work: In addition to teaching time, she gets up at six o'clock in the morning to study politics or correspondence courses, takes a one-hour break after lunch to process students' classroom assignments, and spends one hour in the evening tutoring literacy, and prepares lessons and corrects assignments at other times. Although life is tense, but work and rest are combined, and she is busy but not chaotic. Chen Meigui also pays attention to improving work methods and improving work efficiency. She used to use four lesson preparation notebooks to prepare lessons, and then copied them on another book when combining dynamics and statics, which wasted a lot of time. Later, she absorbed the experience introduced in the "Teacher's Newspaper" and created a more complete loose-leaf lesson preparation notebook. She wrote the teaching content and dynamic and static combination of the four grades in a loose-leaf notebook. It is not only convenient to use, but also the teaching steps are well-organized, so that teachers will not be flustered and confused in the classroom, thus improving the efficiency of lesson preparation.

Due to Chen Meigui's conscientious teaching, the grade retention rate of students has dropped from 20% to 3.6%, and the score of five has increased from 32% to 68% of the whole class. Generally, third-grade students can write short articles of about 200 words, and some fourth-grade children can also help the production team keep accounts.

Chen Meigui is deeply loved by the masses. In 1958, she was honorably named an advanced education worker in Nanping City, and Taxia Primary School was also awarded the honorary title of advanced unit in school work. Chen Meigui said: "All the honors should be attributed to the Party. It is the Party that gives me courage and strength, and makes me understand how to work. I am determined to work hard in the mountains for the rest of my life and strive to become red and expert in the mountain gully!"

    一切为了把孩子教好
    ——记苦干巧干的山区女教师陈美珪
    王丕成
    去年6月，福建南平市教育局对全市小学进行一次抽考，一所四复式的单班小学语文算术总平均成绩均达八十分以上，名列全市初级小学第一位。几年来，曾有不少外地教师来访问这所小学，当他们看到学生良好的自觉纪律，整齐端正的书面作业，内容丰富、语言生动的作文，以及学生正确流畅的朗读和准确的语言表达能力，大家都不约而同的赞扬这所学校的教学质量。这所学校就是南平郊区的塔下初级小学。
    塔下初级小学能有这样高的教学质量，这与教师陈美珪的辛勤劳动是分不开的。为了使孩子们获得更多更好的知识，她灌注了自己全部的心血。
    1954年陈美珪初到塔下初级小学时，学生上课争吵、下课打闹，学校纪律很紊乱。由于缺乏纪律，学生的学习质量很低，有些一年级学生连自己的名字都写不来，由一数到十还常常颠三倒四。“一定要想一切办法把孩子们教好！”她想起党支书、学区校长对工作的指示，想起家长对学校的殷切期待，一种强烈的工作责任感常常使她到深夜还在苦苦思索。起初她想：自己文化程度还不及初等师范，又缺乏复式教学经验，怎样能把孩子们教好呢？但又想起党和群众的支持，她下定决心：一定要排除一切困难，把孩子们教好。
    冒着初春的风雨，她跑遍了周围几个自然村，挨家挨户访问，在乡干部的帮助下，终于把学龄儿童全部动员入学。头几天，她讲革命领袖热爱学习的故事，对学生进行学习目的性的教育，教孩子们唱歌跳舞，使他们对学校和老师产生了感情，引起他们强烈的求学欲望。逃学的现象慢慢消除了。
    为了保证教学的顺利进行，陈美珪一开始就非常重视对学生进行自觉纪律教育。由于真诚的热爱儿童，她一贯坚持正面启发、循循善诱的教育方法。一年级有个姓林的小朋友，性情暴躁，动不动就打人，上课秩序常常被他闹乱，陈美珪几次急得几乎哭起来，但是，她并没有随意处罚他，她从平时细心的观察中，发现这位农民的子弟性格十分朴实直率，有组织能力，爱听故事，于是她就寻找机会亲近他，和他讲革命斗争中团结友爱的故事。有一回他听了志愿军舍身救护朝鲜人民的故事，激动得流下眼泪，他向老师表示要学习志愿军叔叔的榜样，对同学友爱。在班级活动中，陈美珪指派他做队长，大大鼓舞了他的积极性，当了“领导”，当然要以身作则了，于是他不再欺侮同学，还常常帮助年纪小的同学哩！由于陈美珪尊重儿童，热爱儿童，所以，孩子们十分听从她的教导，学校的一些制度逐步建立起来，学校里的自觉纪律也形成了。
    为了使孩子们获得深刻的、牢固的知识，陈美珪每课都付出巨大的劳动代价。四年来，她从来没有一堂课没编写教案就踏进课堂，她非常重视钻研教材。在语文教学和日常生活中，注意联系当前的政治运动，提高少年一代的社会主义和共产主义觉悟。在教学中，陈美珪特别重视通过演示、实验、观察等方式进行直观教学，凡是能让学生看、摸、闻、做的，她一定要想办法做到。如三年级读到“漱口”这一课，为了证明石灰质在醋酸的浸蚀下会变软的道理，她作了用鸡蛋泡在醋里变软的实验，使学生理解和确信了这个难懂的科学道理。
    塔下初小是四复式的单人校，陈美珪每天要熟悉四个年级的语文算术共八科教材，每天备课都要看十六本的课本和参考资料，还要处理一百余本的学生书面作业，除了教学，她还要进行函授学习，参加扫盲工作，而且陈美珪是一个已有四个孩子的母亲，繁琐的家务也常常要拖累不少时间。为了解决任务多和时间不足的矛盾，陈美珪很注意合理地、科学地支配时间，提高工作效率，不浪费一分钟。她利用每学期的寒暑假钻研教材，确定教材的重点，根据教学大纲要求和学生的实际水平，编拟教学进度，上课后利用星期六或星期天熟悉下周的教材，确定每课的教学目的，这样平日备课只要再钻研一下就可掌握住教材了。她给自己每天工作安排了严格的时间表：除教课时间外，早晨六点钟起床后就学习政治或函授，午饭后休息一个钟头就处理学生课堂作业，晚上用一个钟头辅导扫盲，其他时间备课和批改作业，生活虽然紧张，但是劳逸结合，忙而不乱。陈美珪还很注意改进工作方法，提高工作效率，以前备课用四本备课簿，动静搭配时再抄在另一本上，浪费了许多时间，后来她吸收了“教师报”上介绍的经验，创造了一种比较完善的活页备课簿，用一本活页簿子写下四个年级的教学内容和动静搭配，不仅使用方便，而且教学步骤有条不紊，使教师在课堂上不至于慌张错乱，因而提高了备课的效率。
    由于陈美珪认真教学，学生的留级率由20％降低到3.6％，五分的成绩由占全班的32％提高到68％，一般三年级的学生都能写出二百来字较通顺的短文，一些四年级的孩子还能帮助生产队记账。
    陈美珪深受群众的爱戴，1958年光荣的被评为南平市先进教育工作者，塔下小学也得到学校工作先进单位的光荣称号。陈美珪说：“一切荣誉都应该归功于党，是党给我勇气和力量，使我懂得怎样工作，我决心在山区苦干一辈子，争取在山沟里红透专深！”
