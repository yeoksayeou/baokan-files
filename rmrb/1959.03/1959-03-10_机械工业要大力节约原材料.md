Editorial: The Mechanical Industry Must Vigorously Conserve Raw Materials

    In 1958, China's raw materials industry experienced a great leap forward. This year, with the focus on producing 18 million tons of steel, the entire raw materials industry will achieve even greater development in terms of output, variety, and quality. However, judging from the needs of China's high-speed development of production and construction for raw materials, various raw materials are still not abundant. Therefore, how to rationally and economically use raw materials to ensure that limited raw materials achieve maximum results has become a major issue for the processing industry.

    The mechanical industry has always been one of the sectors that consumes the most raw materials. This year, in order to ensure the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and to achieve a greater leap forward in the entire national economy, the mechanical industry sector needs to provide a larger quantity and a greater variety of mechanical equipment, which therefore requires more raw materials. According to preliminary calculations, the amount of raw materials needed by enterprises directly under the First Ministry of Machine Building this year, compared with 1958, will increase steel by about 2.4 times, pig iron by about 3.6 times, copper by about 2.6 times, and aluminum by about 3 times; other acids, alkalis, and various non-metallic materials such as insulation materials will generally increase by several times. The rational and economical use of such a large amount of raw materials is not only one of the important measures to ensure that the mechanical industry itself achieves a greater leap forward this year, but also has great significance for the conservation of raw materials nationwide.

    In order to conserve raw materials, the mechanical industry must first fully and effectively use raw materials and minimize raw material consumption. The mechanical industry sector will use a lot of raw materials this year, and the potential for conservation is considerable. The First Ministry of Machine Building has calculated that based on the amount of raw materials needed by the national mechanical industry sector this year, and based on the actual raw material consumption quotas of last year, if various measures are taken to reduce the consumption of steel and pig iron by 10% each, then more than one million tons of steel and pig iron can be saved throughout the year. According to relevant data, it is entirely possible for each enterprise to reduce its raw material consumption quota this year by 10% on the basis of last year, according to its specific conditions. Therefore, all mechanical factories across the country should include saving 10% of raw materials as an important indicator in this year's leap forward plan, and strive to complete and exceed this indicator in every possible way.

    Based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, launching the masses to carry out technical revolution is an important way to conserve raw materials. The raw material conservation exhibition organized by the First Ministry of Machine Building collected a wealth of experience created by the masses in reforming processing technology, improving product design, and selecting economical materials. This year, we must continue to mobilize the masses, emancipate our minds, break down superstitions, and carry out a major technical revolution in the use of raw materials. Therefore, we should conscientiously summarize and promote existing advanced experiences. Some effective new technologies, such as die forging, die casting, precision casting, powder metallurgy, and hot-rolled gears, should be vigorously promoted. Because the mechanical industry sector includes many industries, with a wide variety of products and different materials, processing methods, and production processes, each enterprise, while actively learning from the experience of other factories, must proceed from reality and formulate its own conservation measures according to its specific circumstances. In the mass movement of technical revolution, we must also strive to improve product quality and reduce the reject rate, which is also an important aspect of saving a lot of raw materials.

    Fully utilizing domestic resources and gradually expanding the variety and quantity of substitute materials under the principle of ensuring product quality and reducing costs is another important way to conserve raw materials. Past production practice has proved that there is much to be done in using substitute materials. For example, substituting steel with iron, forgings with nodular cast iron, non-ferrous metals with ferrous metals, metals with high output for metals with low output, and non-metals such as plastics and cement for metals, all play a significant role in saving materials. Of course, the use of substitute materials requires the implementation of the spirit of scientific analysis, and must undergo rigorous performance testing and technical appraisal before they can be substituted on the premise of ensuring product quality and performance.

    Rational blanking and the utilization of edge and waste materials can save a lot of materials. For example, the blanking of silicon steel sheets for motors, with large, medium, and small sheets nested together, can make the material utilization rate reach more than 90%. The edge and waste materials of transformers, generators, and boilers account for more than 15% of the total material used, and using them to manufacture small transformers and small machines can make the material utilization rate reach more than 90%. If the masses are mobilized to find ways to adopt new structures and welding methods, the utilization rate may even be increased to nearly 100%.

    Strengthening material management is an important measure to ensure material conservation. Material transportation, warehouse management, material requisitioning, material testing and analysis, blanking, and waste material recycling are all important tasks that require the establishment and improvement of necessary systems, the formulation of some conservation measures, and their earnest implementation.

    In short, there are many ways and methods to conserve raw materials, and past production practices have also proved that the potential for conserving raw materials is great. With the continuous improvement of production technology, the possibility of tapping this potential is even greater. The key to turning this possibility into reality lies in the enterprise Party committee strengthening leadership, mobilizing the masses, and taking resolute and specific measures. As long as the above-mentioned work is done conscientiously, the mechanical industry sector will definitely be able to save 10% or even more raw materials this year. The realization of this indicator will enable the mechanical industry to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    机械工业要大力节约原材料
    1958年，我国原材料工业有了巨大跃进。今年以生产一千八百万吨钢为中心的整个原材料工业，在产量、品种和质量方面，还将有更大的发展。但是，从我国生产建设高速度发展对原材料的需要来看，各种原材料还并不是宽裕的。因此，合理地、节约地使用原材料，以保证用有限的原材料发挥最大的效果，就成为加工工业的重大课题。
    机械工业历来是耗用原材料最多的部门之一。今年为了保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现和整个国民经济的更大跃进，机械工业部门要提供数量更大品种更多的机械设备，因此就需要更多的原材料。据初步计算，仅第一机械工业部直属企业今年需用的原材料数量，同1958年比较，钢材增加约二点四倍，生铁增加约三点六倍，铜增加约二点六倍，铝增加约三倍；其他酸类、碱类以及绝缘材料等各种非金属材料，一般也都增加几倍。合理地、节约地使用数量这样众多的原材料，不但是保证机械工业本身实现今年更大跃进的重要措施之一，而且对于全国原材料的节约也具有重大的意义。
    机械工业为了节约原材料，首先必须充分有效地使用原材料，尽量降低原材料消耗量。机械工业部门今年用的原材料很多，节约的潜力也就十分可观。第一机械工业部算过一笔账：以今年全国机械工业部门需要原材料数量为基数，以去年原材料实际消耗定额为基础，如果采取各种措施，把钢材和生铁的耗用量各节约10％，那末，全年就可以节约钢材和生铁一百万吨以上。而根据有关资料计算，每个企业按照自己的具体条件，在去年的基础上将今年的原材料消耗定额降低10％是完全可以作到的。因此，全国机械工厂应该把节约10％的原材料作为一个重要指标，列入今年各厂的跃进计划，并且千方百计地为完成和超额完成这一指标而奋斗。
    根据去年大跃进的经验，发动群众大搞技术革命，是节约原材料的重要途径。第一机械工业部组织的节约材料展览会，就搜集了广大群众在改革加工工艺、改进产品设计、选用经济材料等方面创造的丰富经验。今年还要继续发动群众，解放思想，破除迷信，在原材料使用方面大搞技术革命。因此就应当认真地总结和推广现有的先进经验。一些行之有效的新工艺，如模锻、压铸、精密铸造、粉末冶金、热轧齿轮等，要大力推广。由于机械工业部门包括许多行业，产品品种繁多，需用的材料不同，加工方法和生产过程也各有特点，每个企业在积极学习外厂经验的同时，要从实际出发，根据自己的具体情况，制订各自的节约措施。在技术革命的群众运动中，还要努力提高产品质量，降低废品率，这也是大量节约原材料的一个重要方面。
    充分利用国内资源，在保证产品质量、降低成本的原则下，逐步扩大代用材料的品种和数量，是节约原材料的又一重要途径。过去的生产实践证明，使用代用材料大有可为。如以铁代钢，以球墨铸铁代锻件，以黑色金属代有色金属，以产量多的金属代产量少的金属，以塑料、水泥等非金属代替金属等等，都对节约材料有很大的作用。当然，采用代用材料，需要贯彻科学分析的精神，必须经过严格的性能试验和技术鉴定，在确保产品质量和使用性能的前提下才能代用。
    合理下料和利用边余料，能够节约大量材料。例如，电动机硅钢片大中小兼套着下料，就可以使材料利用率达到90％以上。变压器、发电机和锅炉的边余料占全部用料的15％以上，利用它们来制造小变压器和小机器，可以使材料利用率达到90％以上。如果发动群众想办法，采用新结构和焊接法，利用率还可能提高到接近百分之百。
    加强材料管理工作，是保证节约材料的一个重要措施。材料运输、仓库管理、材料领发、材料试验分析、下料以及废料回收利用等，都是重要工作，需要建立和健全必要的制度，制定一些节约措施，切实执行。
    总之，节约原材料的途径和方法很多，历年的生产实践也证明，节约原材料的潜力是很大的，随着生产技术的不断改进，挖掘这种潜力的可能性就更大，把这种可能性变为现实的关键，一在于企业党委加强领导，二在于发动群众，三在于采取坚决具体的措施。只要切实作好上述工作，机械工业部门今年一定能节约10％以至更多的原材料。这一指标的实现，将使机械工业获得一个更大更好更全面的跃进。
