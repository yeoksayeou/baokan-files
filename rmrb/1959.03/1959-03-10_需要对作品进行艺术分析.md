Title: Need for Artistic Analysis of Works

    Recently, I read Comrade Mao Dun's two articles analyzing short stories ("On Recent Short Stories," published in *People's Literature*, June 1958; "The Bumper Harvest of Short Stories and Several Issues in Creation," published in *People's Literature*, February 1959), which were very enlightening. I discussed them with a friend, who felt the same way. We both think these are two good articles. In his articles, Comrade Mao Dun offered detailed criticisms and suggestions on the artistic techniques of newly created short stories, which is helpful to both authors and readers. My friend said, "It has been a long time since I saw such articles that carefully examine the creative process."

    The phrase "carefully examine the creative process" is well said. The term "carefully examine" (推敲, *tuīqiāo*) as a word, originated after the Tang Dynasty, supposedly from the story of the Tang Dynasty's painstaking poet Jia Dao. Jia Dao was once riding a donkey when he was inspired to write a poem, struggling to find the right image for a line, either "the monk pushes the moonlit gate" (僧推月下門, *sēng tuī yuè xià mén*) or "the monk knocks on the moonlit gate" (僧敲月下門, *sēng qiāo yuè xià mén*). Which word, "推" (*tuī*, push) or "敲" (*qiāo*, knock), better captured the scene he was describing? While contemplating, he gestured the actions of "pushing" and "knocking," momentarily forgetting himself and accidentally barging into the procession of the high official Han Yu, and was arrested to see Han Yu. However, when Han Yu learned that Jia Dao was painstakingly thinking about poetry, he joined him in "carefully examining" the words, and they later became close friends, a story that has been passed down for ages.

    This makes me think about the current state of literary criticism. Of course, we should fully appreciate the tremendous contributions that literary criticism has made in the past few years in the struggle against bourgeois literary thought. However, from another perspective, it is indeed as my friend said, there are fewer articles that carefully examine artistic techniques. In the context of focusing on ideological struggle, this may be unavoidable, but it must be said that it is a deficiency that needs to be supplemented, especially now that we have the conditions for it. We often see critical articles that point out where the author's expression is insufficient or incomplete, but rarely offer suggestions on how the author can express things correctly and comprehensively, or seriously "carefully examine" the work together with the author. Naturally, improving artistic techniques cannot rely solely on literary critics; writers themselves must pay attention to the artistic refinement. From many current works, it is clear that there is a lack of "careful examination." Some works have good subject matter and content, but because the authors have not put effort into artistic techniques, they remain like unpolished jade, not carefully carved by a jade craftsman, and the true beauty of the jade is not revealed, which is a pity.

    It is wrong to unilaterally emphasize artistic techniques while neglecting political and ideological content. However, it cannot be said that advocating artistic techniques is bourgeois literary thought. It is completely wrong to suggest that proletarian art can be crude and shoddy. The proletariat has never advocated for disregarding artistic techniques. In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao explicitly called for "the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible degree of perfection in artistic form" in proletarian literature and art. Our many ancient and earlier writers also provide countless examples. The great poet Du Fu famously said, "I will not rest until my words astonish people." Therefore, as a reader, I have a small hope: that newspaper editorial departments will organize more articles that carefully examine creative work, that the older generation of writers and literary critics will write more of them, and that a trend of carefully examining artistic techniques can be formed among critics and writers, and among writers themselves. In addition, critically inheriting the legacy of ancient literary criticism is also important work, and I hope that publishing houses will organize and compile excellent works of classical literary theory.

    需要对作品进行艺术分析
    最近读了茅盾同志的两篇分析短篇小说的文章（“谈最近的短篇小说”，载人民文学1958年6月号，
  “短篇小说的丰收和创作上的几个问题”，载人民文学1959年2月号）很有启发，和一个朋友谈起，他也有同感。我们都觉得这是两篇好文章。茅盾同志在文章里对新创作的短篇小说的艺术技巧，提出了细致的批评和意见，因而，对作者和读者都有帮助。我的朋友说：“很久没有看到这种推敲创作的文章了。”
    “推敲创作”这句话说得好。所谓“推敲”，作为一个词儿，是唐代以后的事情，据说是由于唐代的苦吟诗人贾岛的故事形成的。贾岛有一次骑驴行路，诗兴大发，苦苦思索一句诗的意境，即“僧推月下门”或“僧敲月下门”，这“推”和“敲”哪一个字更切合他所描写的意境。一边思索，一边比拟着
  “推”和“敲”的姿态，一时忘情，没有留神闯入了大官韩愈的队伍，被抓起来去见韩愈。可是，当韩愈知道了贾岛是为做诗而苦苦思索的时候，也就和他一起“推敲”起来，而且后来成了莫逆之交，传为千古佳话。
    这使我想到了文艺批评的现状。当然我们应该充分估价几年来文艺批评界对资产阶级文艺思想作斗争，是有巨大贡献的，但是从另一个角度来看，确实也像我的朋友所说的，推敲艺术技巧的文章是少了一点。在集中精力进行思想斗争的情况下，这可能也是难免的，但不能不说是一个欠缺，需要补充，特别是现在，已经有这样的条件了。我们经常看到一些评论文章，在指责作者这里表现得不充分，那里表现得不全面的时候，却很少给作者出些主意，告诉作者怎样表现才算正确，才算全面，和作者一起认真地推敲、推敲。自然，提高艺术技巧不能光靠文艺批评家，必须作家自己重视艺术技巧上的加工，从目前许多作品明显地可以看出来，是欠缺“推敲”工夫的。有些作品题材内容很好，就是因为作者在艺术技巧上没有下工夫，结果就只能像璞一样，没有经过玉工的认真琢磨，总是显不出玉的真面目来，令人惋惜。
    片面强调艺术技巧，忽视政治思想内容，是错误的；但不能说凡是提倡艺术技巧就是资产阶级文艺思想。仿佛无产阶级艺术可以粗制滥造，这是完全错误的。无产阶级从来没有提出过不讲究艺术技巧的主张。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”里就明确地号召过，无产阶级的文艺要求“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”。而我们的许多古代的和前辈作家们，也有无数的榜样。伟大的诗人杜甫有过“语不惊人死不休”的名句。因此，作为一个读者，我有这样一点小小的希望，那就是希望报刊编辑部多多组织一些推敲创作的文章，希望老一辈的作家和文艺批评家多多写一些，希望在批评家与作家，作家与作家中间，推敲艺术技巧能够形成一种风气。此外，批判地继承古代文艺批评遗产也是重要的工作，希望出版社整理编选古典文艺理论的优秀著作。
