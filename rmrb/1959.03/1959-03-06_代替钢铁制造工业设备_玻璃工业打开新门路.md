Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th – Glass industries in various locations have successfully used glass to replace steel in the trial manufacturing of fifteen types of equipment and components for the chemical and light industries, including acid-resistant pumps, distillation columns, grease evaporators, tubular boilers, pipes, ball bearings, etc. Seven types are currently in formal mass production.

The trial manufacturing of industrial equipment and components using glass instead of steel began in September of last year. Factories in Taiyuan, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Chengdu, and other places have made achievements in this area. This not only opens up new avenues for the glass industry's own production, but also, in situations where steel raw materials are insufficient, it allows for the manufacture of certain equipment to equip the chemical, food, and light industries, promoting the development of these industries.

Industrial equipment and components manufactured with glass have characteristics such as acid resistance, corrosion resistance, transparency, and cleanliness, and are low in cost and price, which are welcomed by chemical and food factories. For example, glass equipment replacing stainless steel or aluminum in distilling, fractionating, and transporting alcohol and some acidic solutions has excellent corrosion and acid resistance. At the same time, due to its transparency, it is easy for workers to observe fluid movement and chemical reactions during operation. The Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory's glass pipes can replace iron pipes in water and heating projects, while the cost is 60% lower than that of ordinary iron pipes. The factory uses higher quality heat-resistant glass to manufacture civilian boilers, with a cost only one-third of that of cast iron boilers.

The Ministry of Light Industry recently held a meeting in Taiyuan City. Representatives from twelve glass factories exchanged and studied the experiences of using glass to trial-produce industrial equipment over the past few months and discussed how to organize production and further expand trial production projects in the future.

### 代替钢铁制造工业设备  玻璃工业打开新门路

    代替钢铁制造工业设备
    玻璃工业打开新门路
    新华社太原5日电　各地玻璃工业已用玻璃代替钢铁试制成功十五种化学工业和轻工业用的设备和部件，其中包括耐酸泵、分馏塔、油脂蒸发器、排管式锅炉、管道、滚珠轴承等。目前有七种已经正式成批地生产。
    用玻璃代钢铁试制工业设备和部件，是从去年9月开始的，太原、上海、沈阳、天津、成都等地的工厂都在这方面做出了成绩。这不仅为玻璃工业本身的生产开辟了新的门路，而且在钢铁原料不足的情况下，可以制造一部分设备，装备化学工业、食品工业和轻工业，促进这些工业的发展。
    用玻璃制造的工业设备和部件，具有耐酸、抗腐蚀、透明洁净等特性，成本和价格低廉，受到化学工厂和食品工厂的欢迎。如用玻璃代替不锈钢或铝制造的酒精和一些酸性溶液的蒸馏、分馏和输送设备，抗腐、耐酸性能良好，同时还由于透明，便于工人操作时观察流体运动和化学反应情况。沈阳玻璃仪器厂制造的玻璃管道，能代替铁管用于水道、暖气工程上，而成本要比一般铁管低60％；这个厂用质量较高的耐热玻璃制造民用锅炉，造价只有铸铁锅炉的三分之一。
    轻工业部最近在太原市召开会议。会上有十二个玻璃厂的代表交流和研究了近几个月来用玻璃试制工业设备的经验，并且讨论了今后如何组织生产和进一步扩大试制项目等的问题。
