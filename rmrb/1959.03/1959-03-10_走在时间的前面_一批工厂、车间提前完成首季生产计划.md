Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 9th: Workers at the Harbin Power Machine Factory and the Agricultural Machinery Factory have comprehensively completed their first quarter plans ahead of schedule on the 6th, achieving a flying start to the year. The total output value of the two factories in the past two months or so has increased by four times and three point three times respectively compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity has increased by one point seven times and three point two times respectively compared with the same period last year.
	The Harbin Power Machine Factory's first quarter undertaking of manufacturing coking, coal preparation, and drainage and irrigation equipment exceeded its existing production capacity, and the materials on hand were only about a quarter of what was needed. In order to overcome these difficulties and complete the first quarter's task, the factory's Party committee resolutely relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and immediately held symposiums with veteran workers and organized large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, so that all factory workers fully recognized the political and economic significance of ensuring the completion of the first quarter's production plan for completing the four major national targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. They also fully estimated the various favorable factors for completing the task, thereby strengthening their determination and confidence in overcoming difficulties and achieving a great leap forward in production. All factory workers put forward the slogan of ensuring the completion of key national construction projects on time and without missing a single unit, and launched a red flag competition throughout the factory to seize time, take the initiative, and carry out a great technical revolution. Factory-level leading cadres also spend a certain amount of time each month participating in labor in the workshops, working hard, working practically, and working skillfully with the workers to identify and solve problems. In terms of production capacity, after the three-way combination of cadres, technicians, and workers, three types of equipment needed for sand loosening and sand mixing were designed and manufactured, increasing efficiency by twenty times and breaking through the bottleneck of insufficient diesel engine casting supply. During this time, the labor productivity of factory workers continued to increase, with an average of one person being able to do the work of two point seven people in the same period last year, and 10% of the workers doing the work of five people. In terms of raw materials, all factory workers widely opened up sources of raw materials by using methods such as digging, finding, modifying, substituting, saving, and utilizing waste materials.
	In the first quarter, the Harbin Agricultural Machinery Factory also used methods such as informing employees of the situation, tasks, difficulties, and solutions to overcome difficulties in raw materials, equipment, etc., and completed the production tasks ahead of schedule.
	Now, the workers of these two factories are taking the momentum to advance victoriously. Workers at the Harbin Power Machine Factory have proposed to do two months' work in March and exceed the first quarter plan by 50%; workers at the Harbin Agricultural Machinery Factory are also striving to complete the first quarter plan by 40% ahead of schedule by the end of the month.

Xinhua News Agency: Workers at the Tianjin Belt Conveyor Factory, after overfulfilling their production tasks in January and February, completed their first quarter production plan ahead of schedule on the 5th. A batch of belt conveyors they manufactured for the Yangquan Coal Mine has been delivered one month ahead of the contract schedule, and coal washing machines supporting coking production were also put into production in late February ahead of schedule.
	In the first quarter of this year, in addition to more than 7,000 meters of belt conveyors, the state assigned the factory production tasks for lathes needed for rural industrialization, and the production tasks increased by 60.2% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. When discussing this plan, the workers fully recognized the importance of supporting coal production and rural industrialization, and launched a technical revolution movement of "everyone has suggestions, and everyone has innovations." Workers put forward more than 700 technical innovation suggestions in just a few days, and many workers used their spare time to study measures to quickly realize the suggestions, greatly improving labor productivity.
	While carrying out technical innovations, each group also formulated leap forward indicators for daily output and studied various measures to achieve the indicators, so that the leap forward indicators were implemented. Many lathe groups adjusted labor organization and improved equipment utilization and output. In addition, the entire factory launched a production competition of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced between groups and individuals, setting off a hot production upsurge throughout the factory. Therefore, in the twenty-eight days of February, the total output value of the factory increased by 42% compared with January, and labor productivity increased by 64%.
	At present, the workers of this factory are concentrating their efforts on producing coal washing machines, and they guarantee to rush out 192 coal washing machines by mid-May, half a month ahead of the national plan, in order to support coke and coal production as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Workers at the converter workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company completed the first quarter steel production plan ahead of schedule on March 7th; the qualified rate of steel reached 99% in January and February, and rose to 99.14% from March 1st to 6th.
	The Party and government leading cadres of this workshop often study and improve operating techniques with the workers, and assign full-time technicians to be responsible for batching; the workers in the converter section who directly control the pouring of molten iron ensure accurate charging; timely summarizing and promoting advanced smelting experience, etc., are all important measures for this workshop to ensure high yield and high quality. At present, all workshop workers are continuing to vigorously implement the above-mentioned effective measures, and strive to produce more and better steel in March. Their slogan is: grasp tightly every day, grasp tightly every month, high production in January and February, and even higher production in March.

    走在时间的前面
    一批工厂、车间提前完成首季生产计划
    哈尔滨两机械厂产值跃增三倍到四倍
    天津皮带运输机厂提前履行订货合同
    石钢转炉车间钢的合格率达99％以上
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　哈尔滨动力机厂、农业机械厂职工已在6日提前全面完成了第一季度计划，实现了首季满堂红。两厂今年两个多月来的总产值分别比去年同期提高了四倍和三点三倍，劳动生产率分别比去年同期提高一点七倍和三点二倍。
    哈尔滨动力机厂第一季度承担的炼焦、选煤和排灌等设备的制造任务，工作量超过现有生产能力，而且手头现有材料又只及需要量的四分之一左右。为了克服这些困难，完成第一季度任务，工厂党委坚决依靠群众，发动群众，立即召开老工人座谈会和组织大鸣大放大辩论大字报，使全厂职工充分认识到确保完成第一季度生产计划对于完成全国钢煤粮棉四大指标的政治意义和经济意义，并且充分估计完成任务的各种有利因素，从而坚定了克服困难，实现生产大跃进的决心和信心。全厂职工提出了确保国家重点建设，任务按时完成、一台不少的口号，在全厂范围内展开了抢时间，争主动，大闹技术革命的红旗竞赛。厂级领导干部也每月抽出一定时间到车间参加劳动，与工人一起苦干、实干、巧干，发现问题解决问题。在生产能力方面，经过干部、技术人员和工人三结合，设计制造了松砂、混砂等需用的三种设备，提高效率二十倍，突破了柴油机铸件供应不足的关键。在这时间，工厂职工劳动生产率不断提高，平均一人能顶上去年同期二点七个人，其中10％的工人一人顶上了五个人。在原材料方面，全厂职工运用挖、找、改、代、节约、利用废料等办法，广泛地开辟了原材料来源。
    哈尔滨农业机械厂在第一季度中，也运用向职工群众交形势、交任务、交困难、交办法等办法，突破原材料、设备等困难，提前完成了生产任务。
    现在这两个厂职工正在一鼓作气，乘胜前进。哈尔滨动力机厂职工提出要在3月份干出两个月的活，超过第一季度计划50％；哈尔滨农业机械厂职工也争取到月底超额40％完成第一季度计划。
    新华社讯　天津市皮带运输机厂的职工，继超额完成1、2月份的生产任务以后，在5日又提前完成了第一季度的生产计划。他们为阳泉煤矿制造的一批皮带运输机已经比合同规定的时间提早一个月交货，支援炼焦生产的洗煤机，也提前在2月下旬投入生产。
    今年第一季度国家分配给这个工厂的生产任务除了七千多公尺的皮带运输机外，还有农村工业化需要的车床，生产任务比去年第四季度增加了60.2％。职工们在讨论这个计划时，充分认识到支援煤炭生产和农村工业化的重要意义，掀起了一个“人人有建议，个个有革新”的技术革命运动。职工们在短短的几天内就提出七百多件技术革新建议，很多工人都利用业余时间研究措施，使建议很快得到实现，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    在开展技术革新的同时，各个小组还分别制订出日产量的跃进指标，研究出实现指标的各种措施，使跃进指标落实。许多车工小组调整了劳动组织，提高了设备利用率和产量。此外，全厂组对组、人对人地开展了学先进、比先进、赶先进的生产竞赛。使全厂掀起了一个热火朝天的生产高潮。因此，2月份二十八天中，全厂生产总值比1月份增加了42％，劳动生产率提高了64％。
    目前，这个厂的职工正集中力量生产洗煤机，他们保证在5月中旬比国家计划提早半个月，把一百九十二台洗煤机赶制出来，以便尽快地支援焦煤生产。
    新华社8日讯　石景山钢铁公司转炉车间职工在3月7日提前完成了第一季度产钢计划；钢的合格率1、2月份达到99％，3月1日到6日又上升到99.14％。
    这个车间的党政领导干部经常同工人一道研究改进操作技术，并且指定专职技术员负责配料；转炉工段直接掌握倒铁水的工人作到了下料准确；及时总结推广先进的吹炼经验等等，这些都是这个车间保证高产高质的重要措施。目前，全车间职工正在继续大力贯彻执行上述有效措施，力争在3月份炼出更多更好的钢。他们的口号是：日日抓紧，月月抓紧，1、2月高产，3月更要高产。
