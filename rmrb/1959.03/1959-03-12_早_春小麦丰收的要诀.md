    The Key to a Good Harvest of Early Spring Wheat
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The spring wheat region has always been a high-yield area for wheat in our country. In 1958, the average yield per mu of spring wheat nationwide was more than 20% higher than that of winter wheat. Although the planting area of spring wheat is only about one-eighth of that of winter wheat, the area of land yielding over 1,000 jin per mu for spring wheat last year was two-thirds more than that of winter wheat. In Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, the total of more than 60,000 mu of spring wheat achieved a yield of 1,037 jin per mu, becoming the first county in the country with a yield of over 1,000 jin of wheat. This year, the planting area of winter wheat is about 10 million mu less than last year; in order to ensure the completion of this year's wheat production increase target, it is necessary to vigorously expand the planting area of spring wheat and strive for high yields. Obviously, under the current circumstances of a reduced winter wheat area, actively expanding the spring wheat area and increasing the proportion of spring wheat is a powerful measure to increase the unit yield of wheat and ensure the completion of this year's wheat production increase target. Spring wheat is an important grain crop in the spring wheat region. In major spring wheat producing areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia, and Gansu, the spring wheat area accounts for about one-quarter to one-half of the grain crop area, and the yield per unit area is higher than that of general grain crops in the area. The spring wheat region generally has more land and fewer people, spring wheat cultivation is labor-saving, and suitable for mechanical farming. Planting more spring wheat can also free up labor to cultivate mid-season crops such as corn. Spring wheat is also the main fine grain in the spring wheat region. Currently, wheat production in the spring wheat region, especially in the Northeast, is far from meeting the growing needs of urban industrial and mining areas. Therefore, expanding the spring wheat area and actively planting spring wheat is of greater significance for increasing grain production in the spring wheat region and improving the material life of the people in the spring wheat region. Now, the spring wheat sowing in North China has entered a large-scale phase, and spring wheat in Northwest, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast China will also be sown successively. We should implement the spring wheat sowing plan to the cooperative as soon as possible to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the spring wheat sowing area; and like winter wheat, we should carry out a mass movement for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu with full confidence, and strive to have more 1,000-jin teams, 1,000-jin cooperatives, 1,000-jin counties, and 1,000-jin special districts.

    The first key to striving for a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu of spring wheat is to grasp soil, fertilizer, water, and seeds, and do a good job of pre-sowing preparations as early as possible. At present, the deep plowing work in the spring wheat region has achieved great success. Heilongjiang Province plans to plant all spring wheat on deeply plowed land. Deep plowing is the foundation for increasing spring wheat production; in areas with irrigation conditions, if deep plowing was not carried out last winter, it should be continued after the wheat fields thaw. The general plowing depth should be guaranteed to reach about seven inches, and strive to reach about one foot. At present, the base fertilizer prepared in various places for spring wheat has reached 10,000 to 30,000 jin per mu, and in some cases as much as 40,000 to 50,000 jin. However, most of it is coarse fertilizer, and most of it has not been delivered to the fields. Spring wheat is sown early and has a short growing period, requiring a lot of fertilizer in the early stages. The spring wheat region should immediately adjust labor and animal power, reform transportation tools, transport the existing fertilizer to the fields in a concentrated effort, and apply more fine fertilizer and some seed fertilizer. This year, the national spring wheat irrigation area is about 30 million mu. We should level the land and tidy up the ridges in a timely manner, solve the problem of water lifting tools, and try every means to expand the wheat watering area. Dryland spring wheat should be harrowed in time to prevent drought and conserve moisture.

    On the basis of doing a good job in pre-sowing preparations, in order to achieve high yields, it is also necessary to sow early and plant well, and manage early and manage well, according to the growth and development characteristics of spring wheat.

    Early sowing plays an important role in increasing spring wheat production. The agricultural proverb in the spring wheat region "sow on ice, harvest on fire" means this. Last year's high-yield spring wheat fields were sown ten days to half a month earlier than ordinary fields. Because spring wheat can germinate at a temperature of about 0 degrees Celsius; low temperature is conducive to the growth of young roots and deep rooting. Spring wheat will quickly joint and stop tillering after emergence when it encounters high temperatures; therefore, early sowing can increase the tillering time of wheat, increase the number of plants and ears. Because the temperature is relatively low when early-sown spring wheat forms its base stems and heads, it can also increase the seed setting rate of spikelets and increase the number of grains per ear. Early sowing can also make timely use of the water from the early spring thaw to prevent spring drought; and it can mature earlier, avoiding rain damage and reducing rust damage.

    In order for wheat to reach a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, there must be more than 500,000 fertile ears per mu. Spring wheat has a shorter tillering period than winter wheat, and generally tillers less, so the planting density is generally greater than that of winter wheat, and the sowing amount can be increased to 30 to 50 jin. Areas with conditions can also use ammonium sulfate as seed fertilizer to promote vigorous seedling growth, increase tillering, and ensure that there are more than 500,000 plants per mu.

    Underground pests and bunt are the main diseases and insect pests in the spring wheat region. Soil should be disinfected with "666" when sowing, and seeds should be mixed with "Ceresan."

    Spring wheat has a short growing period, and the key to field management is still the word "early." We must promote early growth and development of wheat seedlings, especially early topdressing and early watering.

    This year's grain production task is very arduous, and what is decisive for the overall situation is to fight the first battle well and strive for a greater summer harvest this year. To strive for a summer harvest, the South focuses on early rice, the North focuses on winter wheat, and the spring wheat region focuses on spring wheat. We must start from grasping the immediate, grasping the sown area, grasping the sowing preparation, grasping the field management, step by step, never letting go, and grasping it from beginning to end.

    早——春小麦丰收的要诀
    本报评论员
    春麦区历来是我国小麦的高产地区。1958年全国春小麦平均亩产比冬小麦高出20％多。春小麦的播种面积虽然只有冬小麦的八分之一左右，但去年春小麦的千斤田面积却比冬小麦多三分之二。甘肃省敦煌县全县六万多亩春小麦，亩产一千零三十七斤，成为全国第一个小麦千斤县。今年冬小麦的播种面积约比去年减少一千万亩左右；为了保证完成今年小麦增产任务，就需要努力扩大春小麦播种面积，并力争高产。显然，在当前冬小麦面积缩小的情况下，积极扩大春小麦面积，增加春小麦比重，是提高小麦单位产量和保证完成今年小麦增产任务的有力措施。春小麦是春麦区的重要粮食作物，在青海、宁夏、甘肃等主要春小麦产区，春小麦面积占粮食作物面积的四分之一到二分之一左右，单位面积产量高于当地一般粮食作物。春麦区一般地多人少，春小麦栽培省工，适宜于机械耕作，多种春小麦还可腾出劳力种好玉米等中耕作物。春小麦还是春麦区的主要细粮，目前春麦区小麦生产特别是东北地区大大不能满足城市工矿区日益发展的需要。因此，扩大春小麦面积，积极种好春小麦，对提高春麦区粮食产量，改善春麦区人民物质生活更有重要意义。现在华北春小麦播种已进入大流，西北、内蒙、东北的春小麦也将陆续播种，应当及早使春麦播种计划落实到社，保证完成和超额完成春小麦播种面积；并且要像对待冬小麦那样，满怀信心地开展亩产千斤的群众运动，争取出现更多千斤队、千斤社、千斤县和千斤专区。
    力争春小麦亩产千斤以上的第一个关键是抓住土、肥、水、种，及早做好播种前的准备工作。目前春麦区深翻地工作已取得很大成就。黑龙江省计划春小麦要全部种在深翻地上。深翻地是春小麦增产的基础；有灌溉条件的地区，去冬没有深翻的，麦田开冻以后，还应继续深翻，一般耕深应保证达到七寸左右，争取达到一尺左右。目前各地准备的春麦基肥已达到每亩一万到三万斤，多的有四万到五万斤。但大部分是粗肥，而且多数没有送到地里。春小麦播种早，生长期短，早期需要的肥料多。春麦区应该立即调整劳畜力，改革运输工具，把现有肥料突击运到田间，并多施一些细肥，增加一些种肥。今年全国春麦灌溉面积约有三千多万亩，应该及时平地整畦，解决提水工具等问题，想尽一切办法扩大浇麦面积。旱地春麦要及时顶凌耙地，防旱保墒。
    在作好播种前准备工作的基础上，要达到高产，还必须根据春小麦生长发育的特点，早种，种好；早管，管好。
    早种对于春小麦增产有重要作用。春麦区的农谚“种在冰上，收在火上”就是这个意思。去年的春小麦高产田，都比一般田提早播种十天到半月。因为春小麦在摄氏零度左右的温度就可以发芽；在低温条件下有利于幼根生长，扎根深。春小麦出苗以后遇到高温就会很快拔节生长，停止分蘖；因此，早播能增加小麦分蘖时间，增加株数和穗数。由于早播的春麦在形成基秆和抽穗的时候气温比较低，还能增加小穗的结实率，增加每穗粒数。早播还可以及时利用早春化冻的水分，防止春旱；并可较早成熟，躲过雨害和减轻锈病为害。
    小麦要达到亩产千斤以上，必须每亩有结实穗五十万个以上。春小麦比冬小麦分蘖期短，一般分蘖较少，因此密植程度一般比冬小麦还要大些，播种量可以增加到三十到五十斤。有条件的地区还可以用硫铵作种肥，以促使幼苗生长健壮，增加分蘖，保证每亩有五十万株以上。
    地下害虫和腥黑穗病是春小麦区的主要病虫害。在播种时要用“六六六”把土壤消毒，用“赛力散”拌种。
    春小麦生长期短，田间管理的关键仍是一个“早”字。要促使麦苗早长早发，特别是要早追肥、早浇水。
    今年的粮食生产任务是很艰巨的，而对全局有决定意义的是打好第一仗，争取今年夏季更大丰收。争取夏季丰收，在南方是抓早稻，在北方是抓冬麦，在春麦区就是抓春麦。要从抓眼前起，抓播种面积，抓播种准备，抓田间管理，一步不松，一着不让，从头抓到底。
