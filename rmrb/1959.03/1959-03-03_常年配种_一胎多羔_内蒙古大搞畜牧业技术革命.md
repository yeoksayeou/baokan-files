Year-Round Breeding, Multiple Births
Inner Mongolia Launches Livestock Technology Revolution

(Reported by this newspaper) The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, both herdsmen and farmers, are vigorously promoting livestock technology reforms such as two lambings per ewe per year and multiple births per litter, in order to welcome a new upsurge in livestock production.

For many years, hundreds of millions of ewes on the Inner Mongolian grasslands have relied on natural mating, producing only one lamb per year. With the communization of pastoral areas, the broad masses of herdsmen have further mastered the science and technology of livestock production, and the conventional practice of seasonal breeding is being replaced by the new rule of year-round breeding. In order to develop animal husbandry at high speed, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region bred more than one million winter lambs early last summer. Now, all these winter lambs have been born, with a survival rate of about 95%. In conjunction with the delivery of winter lambs and the current spring lambs, the herdsmen have also adopted various measures to induce estrus in ewes, organized artificial insemination technical teams, and carried out breeding work after the winter and spring lambing season. This is a major technological reform in the livestock production of the autonomous region.

A technical reform movement to increase the "output per unit area" of ewes has also been launched. People's communes in the Zhaowuda, Yikezhao, and Ulanqab areas are now, on the one hand, taking care of spring lambing, and on the other hand, organizing manpower to strengthen the postpartum management of ewes, selecting healthy ewes to inject pregnant mare serum before estrus. Injecting serum from healthy mares that are forty to one hundred and twenty days pregnant into ewes before estrus to increase lambing rates is an innovation that began to be successfully tested in Inner Mongolia's livestock production during the Great Leap Forward last year, and has achieved good results. In the Bayinxili Brigade of the Bayir Wula People's Commune in the Xilin Gol grassland, 447 ewes were injected with pregnant mare serum for multiple-birth breeding experiments last autumn. Now these ewes have begun to give birth, and all of the more than 150 ewes that have already given birth have produced twins.

    常年配种　一胎多羔
    内蒙古大搞畜牧业技术革命
    本报讯  内蒙古自治区各族牧民和农民，大搞母畜一羊两产和一胎多羔的畜牧业技术改革，迎接新的牧业生产高潮。
    多年来，内蒙古草原牧场上的成百成千万头母畜，一直是依靠自然交配，一年一产的。随着牧区人民公社化，广大牧民进一步掌握畜牧生产的科学技术，那种局限于季节配种的惯例，正被常年配种的新规代替着，自治区各族牧民和农民，为了高速度发展畜牧业，去年夏季就提早配种了百万多头冬羔，现在这批冬羔，已全部出生，成活率达95％左右。结合冬羔和目前春羔的接产，牧民们又采取各项母畜催情措施，组织人工授精技术力量，开展了冬春羔产后的配种工作。这是自治区畜牧业生产上出现的一项重大技术改革。
    提高母畜“单位面积产量”的技术改革运动也已展开。昭乌达、伊克昭和乌兰察布地区各人民公社，现在一方面接产春羔，一方面组织人力加强母畜产后管理，选择健壮母畜在发情前注射妊娠马血清。把妊娠已四十到一百二十天的健康母马血清，注射给发情前的母羊，来提高产羔率，是去年大跃进中内蒙古畜牧业生产上开始试验成功的一项创举，并且收到了良好效果。锡林郭勒草原巴伊尔乌拉人民公社巴音锡里大队，去年秋季给四百四十七只母羊注射妊娠马血清，进行了多胎配种试验，现在这批母羊开始生产，已经畜羔的一百五十多只母羊，只只都产了双羔。
