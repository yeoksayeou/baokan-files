Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 29th - According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: Czechoslovak Deputy Foreign Minister Hájek reiterated on the 28th that the Czechoslovak government requests to participate as an equal member in the Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the top-level meeting that are being prepared.

　　Hájek reaffirmed the Czechoslovak government's position when he received representatives from the U.S., British, and French embassies in Prague.

　　Hájek emphasized that Czechoslovakia, as a country that was first subjected to Nazi aggression and borders two German states, is very concerned about the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the resolution of all the issues that will be considered.

　　Hájek expressed surprise at the fact that, although the Western governments recognized in their March 26th note to the Soviet government that Poland and Czechoslovakia had legitimate reasons and direct interests in participating in the discussion of these issues, they were, in contradiction to this, attempting to limit or even exclude these two countries from these negotiations.

    捷克斯洛伐克外交部副部长重申
    捷应参加外长会议和最高级会议
    新华社布拉格29日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克外交部副部长哈耶克28日再一次表示，捷克斯洛伐克政府要求作为平等的一员参加正在准备中的外长会议和最高级会议。
    哈耶克是在接见美、英、法三国驻布拉格大使馆的代表时，重申捷克斯洛伐克政府的这一态度的。
    哈耶克强调说，捷克斯洛伐克作为首先遭受纳粹侵略并且同两个德国毗邻的国家，十分关心缔结对德和约以及将要加以考虑的一切问题的解决。
    哈耶克对这样一种情况表示奇怪：西方国家政府在3月26日给苏联政府的照会中虽然承认波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参与讨论这些问题，是有正当的理由和直接的利害关系的，但是同这一点矛盾的是，它们又力图限制这两个国家参加这些谈判，甚至排斥它们参加。
