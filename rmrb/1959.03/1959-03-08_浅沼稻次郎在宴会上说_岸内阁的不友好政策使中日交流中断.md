    Asanuma Inejirō Says at Banquet
    Kishida Cabinet's Unfriendly Policies Have Interrupted Sino-Japanese Exchanges

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) At the welcome banquet held by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Asanuma Inejirō, leader of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation, delivered the following full text of his speech:

    Mr. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Comrades and Friends of the People's Republic of China:

    Our Japanese Socialist Party delegation is visiting your country again. We were deeply moved by the warm welcome we received at the airport this morning and this grand welcome banquet. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all comrades and friends on behalf of the entire delegation, and also allow me to say a few words.

    Two years ago, our Japanese Socialist Party delegation visited China and had frank talks with you all. We were deeply moved by your friendship, which did not dwell on the past, and by your forward-looking approach. Although diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not yet been restored, we have reached various agreements on exchanges and friendship in various fields. Since then, other Japanese civil groups have visited China, signed many civil agreements, and conveyed the friendship of a leaping-forward China to the Japanese people.

    In this way, the friendship between Japan and China and the exchanges between the two countries have further developed. At this time, due to the unfriendly policies adopted by the conservative and reactionary Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet in our country since last year, exchanges have been interrupted, and the promises we made have not been fulfilled. We sincerely regret this.

    At the same time, some people have not reflected sufficiently on what they did in the past, and the Nagasaki flag incident occurred. Now they are attempting to strengthen the Japan-U.S. security system, which has caused trouble for your country. We also feel sincere regret about this. Our peace and reform forces are not strong enough, and therefore, we have not been able to completely change the diplomatic line of befriending distant countries and attacking neighboring ones into a diplomatic line of good-neighborliness, peace, and friendship. This is a regrettable thing. However, our Socialist Party has been fighting to break the Japan-U.S. security system, to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and to establish a new security system linking the East and West camps. In the future, we will continue to fight to the end for the people of Japan and China, and for the people of Asia and the whole world.

    This time, we are prepared to discuss the following issues: First, the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, Asian peace, the establishment of non-nuclear zones in the Far East, the convening of the Asian-African Conference, and the issue of world peace. Second, economic cooperation issues, issues related to personnel exchanges, culture, and technical exchanges.

    In particular, we are willing to discuss issues that have been interrupted. We know it will be difficult to discuss issues that have been interrupted, but we will sincerely convey the feelings, wishes, and hopes of the Japanese people to your country. We hope that through a frank exchange of opinions, the relationship between the two countries can move forward.

    Finally, I would like to add one more sentence. When I came here the year before last, I said at a welcome banquet like this one: It takes two days and two nights to get from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Beijing via Hong Kong, but it only takes three hours to fly directly from Haneda Airport to Beijing. (I said) I hope this can be realized as soon as possible. But it has not yet been realized, and I feel very regretful. I sincerely hope that diplomatic relations between Japan and China will be restored soon, and that various pending issues will be resolved so that this wish can be realized.

    When I came the year before last, Mr. Mao Zedong said: Now, China is beginning a new war, that is, the struggle against nature. Now China is carrying out a simultaneous leap forward in industry and agriculture throughout the country, and is winning victories in the struggle against nature, which is deeply moving. I sincerely wish you success in the future.

    浅沼稻次郎在宴会上说
    岸内阁的不友好政策使中日交流中断
    本报讯　日本社会党代表团团长浅沼稻次郎在中国人民外交学会会长张奚若举行的欢迎宴会上讲话全文如下：
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若先生、中华人民共和国的同志们、朋友们：
    我们日本社会党代表团再次访问贵国，今天早晨承蒙诸位到机场欢迎，现在又举行了如此盛大的欢迎宴会。这使我们非常感激。请允许我借此机会代表全团向同志们、朋友们表示衷心的感谢，同时请允许我讲几句话。
    两年前，我们日本社会党代表团访问中国，同各位先生坦率地进行了交谈。各位先生不究既往的友情和向前迈进的情况，使我们很受感动。尽管日中两国的邦交还没有恢复，但是我们还是在各方面达成了各种交流和友好的协议。在这以后，又有日本民间团体访问中国，签订了许多民间协定，并且向日本国民传达了跃进中的中国的友情。
    这样，日中两国的友好和两国间的交流有了进一步的发展。在这个时候，由于我国的保守反动的岸信介内阁从去年以来采取了不友好的政策，交流中断了，我们所做的诺言没有能够付诸实现。我们对此衷心感到遗憾。
    同时，由于一部分人对于过去做的事反省不够，发生了长崎国旗事件等，现在他们又企图加强日美安全体制等，这些都给贵国带来了麻烦。我们对此也感到衷心的遗憾。我们的和平和革新的力量不够，因此，没有能够使远交近攻的外交路线完全改变为友好睦邻和和平友好的外交路线。这是很可惜的事情。可是，我们社会党为了打破日美安全体制，为了恢复日中邦交，为了树立联结东西两阵营的新的安全体制而进行了斗争。今后，我们也将为日中两国人民，为亚洲和全世界的人类而斗争到底。
    我们这次来，准备就下列各项问题进行商谈。第一、恢复日中邦交、亚洲和平、在远东设立非核武装地区、召开亚非会议以及世界和平的问题。第二、经济合作的问题、关于人物来往、文化、技术交流等问题。
    特别是愿意就曾经一度中断的问题进行商谈。我们想商谈已经中断了的问题，是会有困难的，但是我们将诚心诚意地向贵国转达日本人民的心情、愿望和希望，我们希望能够通过坦率地交换意见，使两国关系前进一步。
    最后，我愿意再补充一句。前年来的时候，在像今天这样一个欢迎宴会上我曾经说：从东京羽田机场经过香港到北京，一定要在路上需要过二天二晚，可是从羽田机场直接飞北京，只有三个小时就够了。（我曾经说）希望早日实现这一点。可是至今还没有实现，我感到很遗憾，我衷心希望早日恢复日中邦交，解决种种悬案，以便实现这个愿望。
    前年来的时候，毛泽东先生说：现在，中国正开始进行新的战争，那就是同自然的斗争。现在中国在全国各地展开工农业的同时跃进，并且正在同自然的斗争中取得胜利，令人深为感动。我衷心祝愿你们今后的成功。
