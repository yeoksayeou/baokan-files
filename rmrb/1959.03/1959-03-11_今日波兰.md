	Today's Poland
		New Look of Warsaw
		This January marked the fourteenth anniversary of the liberation of Warsaw. During the Second World War, Warsaw suffered 600,000 casualties, and 85% of the city's economy was destroyed, with 11,300 buildings reduced to ruins. The Hitlerites destroyed 732 of Warsaw's 957 monuments and ancient buildings, and damaged 658 schools.
		Today, Warsaw has a population of 1,110,000. In the fourteen years since the war, Warsaw has built and restored 377,000 housing units. In addition, 87 schools have been built, and 88 kindergartens and 46 nurseries have been opened. The number of hospital beds has increased by 5,923. The city currently has 42 cinemas and theaters, and 25 union, cooperative, and club film screening rooms.
		Developing Atomic Energy Program
		The first atomic reactor and the first cyclotron with a power of 13 million electron volts, built by the Polish people with the assistance of the Soviet Union, both began operation in 1958. According to Poland's long-term plan for the utilization of atomic energy, Poland's first atomic power station is expected to be put into production around 1965. In 1970, the first nuclear-powered ship will also be built.
		Emerging Shipping Industry
		Before the war, Poland was backward in maritime affairs, with only a small number of merchant ships and a small shipyard in Gdansk. After liberation, Poland's shipping industry has developed greatly. In 1958 alone, Poland built six large ships, each with a capacity of 10,000 tons. Poland's merchant fleet regularly sails on 23 sea routes, maintaining direct maritime transportation with ports in Asia, Africa, North America, and South America.
	Exporting Machines to Sixty Countries
		In the past, Poland's exports were mainly coal and agricultural products, and the total value of machinery and equipment exports was less than 1%. With the tremendous development of national industry, Polish machinery accounted for 25% of total exports in 1958. Currently, Poland exports machinery and equipment to sixty countries around the world. (Attached images)

    今日波兰
  　华沙新貌
    今年1月华沙解放已十四周年。在第二次世界大战期间，华沙居民死伤达六十万人，全市85％的经济遭到破坏，有一万一千三百幢房屋变成废墟。希特勒分子把华沙的九百五十七座纪念碑和古代建筑物毁坏了七百三十二座，并且破坏了六百五十八所学校。
    今天，华沙拥有一百一十一万居民。战后十四年来，华沙新建和修复了三十七万七千间住房。此外，还盖了八十七所学校，开办了八十八个幼儿园和四十六个托儿所。病床增加了五千九百二十三个。全市现有四十二个影剧院和二十五个工会、合作社和俱乐部的电影放映厅。
          发展原子能计划
    波兰人民在苏联的援助下建造的第一个原子反应堆和第一座功率为一千三百万电子伏特的回旋加速器都已在1958年内先后开始工作。根据波兰利用原子能的长期规划，波兰的第一个原子能发电站大约要在1965年投入生产。在1970年还将建造第一艘用原子能推进的船。
      新兴的航运业
    战前，波兰在航海事业方面是落后的，全国只有少量的商船，在革但斯克有一个小型的船舶修理厂，解放后，波兰的航运事业有了很大的发展。只在1958年里，波兰就建造了六艘每艘各一万吨的大船。波兰的商船队经常在二十三条海运航线上航行，同亚洲、非洲、北美和南美各地的港口保持着直接的海上交通。
  向六十个国家出口机器
    在过去，波兰的出口货物以煤炭和农产品为主，机器设备的出口总值还不到1％。随着国家工业的巨大发展，1958年波兰的机器已占出口总额的25％。目前波兰已向世界上六十个国家输出机器和设备。（附图片）
