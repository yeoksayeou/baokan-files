To supply more high-quality breeding stock to the whole country, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is comprehensively carrying out the eight basic constructions of "fodder grass and feed, breeding, improved varieties, feeding management, livestock protection and disaster prevention, water conservancy, and tool reform" in order to build the autonomous prefecture into a high-quality breeding stock base for our country as soon as possible. This year, more than 6.9 million livestock in the entire autonomous prefecture will breed more than 2.6 million young livestock. In addition to supporting more than 500,000 head of high-quality breeding stock, draught animals, and meat livestock to various provinces across the country and Xinjiang, the net increase rate of livestock at the end of the year will reach 20%, which is three times that of last year.

The animal husbandry economy accounts for more than half of the total value of the national economy of the autonomous prefecture. The fine-wool Xinjiang sheep that produce both wool and meat, the Ili horse that is used for both riding and draught, the Ili cattle that produce both milk and meat, and the Altai Mountain meat-producing fat-tailed sheep, which are cultivated here, have won praise from farmers and herdsmen all over the country. In the four years before 1957, only more than 16,000 Ili horses and more than 20,000 Xinjiang fine-wool sheep were purchased from Ili. During the great leap forward in agriculture and animal husbandry last year, the autonomous prefecture transferred more than 100,000 head of high-quality breeding stock, draught animals, and meat livestock within one year. Ili's high-quality breeding stock has spread to more than 20 provinces (cities) and autonomous regions across the country.

The people's commune movement has opened up broad prospects for the high-speed development of animal husbandry in the autonomous prefecture. The original 580 agricultural cooperatives and 971 pastoral cooperatives in the prefecture have now been merged into more than 140 large-scale agricultural and pastoral integrated people's communes. On average, each people's commune has 40,000 to 50,000 mu of cultivated land and more than 50,000 livestock. The commune implements the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, unified utilization of grassland, establishes animal husbandry professional teams, begins to reorganize livestock herds and gradually implements zoned rotational grazing, which greatly improves the carrying capacity of natural pastures. It is estimated that the carrying capacity of grassland in the whole prefecture can be increased from the current 6.9 million to more than 30 million. In particular, during the Great Leap Forward last year, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups extensively built water conservancy projects and reclaimed more than 800,000 mu of wasteland. The total grain output increased by 55.2%. Most animal husbandry counties have become self-sufficient in grain with a surplus, while also producing large amounts of fodder grass and feed for animal husbandry production.

    供应全国更多优良种畜
    伊犁哈萨克自治州全面进行畜牧业基本建设
    本报讯　为了尽快地把伊犁哈萨克族自治州建成为我国的优良种畜基地，自治州全面进行“饲草、饲料、繁殖、改良品种、饲养管理、保畜防灾、水利、工具改革”八项基本建设。今年，全自治州六百九十多万头牲畜将繁殖幼畜二百六十多万头，除支援全国各省和新疆各地优良种畜，耕畜和肉用牲畜五十多万头外，年终牲畜净增率将达到20％，相当去年的三倍。
    畜牧业经济占自治州国民经济总值一半以上。这里培育的毛肉兼用的新疆细毛羊，乘挽兼用的伊犁马，乳肉兼用的伊犁牛和阿尔泰山区肉用大尾羊，获得了全国各地农牧民的好评。1957年前的四年间，全国各地购买伊犁马只有一万六千多匹，新疆细毛羊两万多只。去年农牧业大跃进，自治州一年之内外调优良种畜、耕畜和肉用牲畜达十万多头。伊犁优良种畜遍及全国二十多个省（市）和自治区。
    人民公社化运动给自治州畜牧业高速度发展开辟了广阔的前途。全州原有五百八十个农业社和九百七十一个牧业社，现在合并建立了一百四十多个大型的农牧结合的人民公社。平均每个人民公社拥有四万到五万亩耕地和五万多头牲畜。公社实行农牧结合，草原统一利用，建立了畜牧业专业队，开始整编畜群和逐步地实行划区轮牧，大大提高了天然牧场的载畜量，估计全州草原载畜量可以从现在的六百九十多万头提高到三千多万头。特别是各族农牧民在去年大跃进中广泛兴修水利，开垦了八十多万亩荒地，粮食总产量增加55.2％，多数牧业县粮食已经自给有余，同时给畜牧生产出大量饲草和饲料。
