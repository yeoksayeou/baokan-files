Shexian County, Anhui Province, is located in the mountainous area of southern Anhui, where the main production activities are tea and forestry. Tea accounts for 30% of the total annual income, and in key tea-producing townships and communes, it accounts for more than 80%. The county has a total tea garden area of 131,327 mu, including 68,432 mu of tea-grain intercropping tea gardens. After the rectification movement, the broad masses of farmers are full of fighting spirit and vigor. While industry and agriculture are leaping forward at a rapid pace, they are also sweeping away all difficulties with overwhelming force and rushing towards high-yield tea production. The county's tea output last year increased by 68% compared with the actual output in 1957, breaking the highest pre-war annual output in one fell swoop. The average yield per mu increased from 89.5 jin in 1957 to 144 jin (calculated based on the tea picking area). Due to the unprecedented increase in tea output, before the communization, out of the 392 tea-producing cooperatives in the county, 385 cooperatives increased production and value compared with the previous year. In addition, some achievements have also been made in opening up new tea gardens and transforming old ones. Since last spring, the county has expanded new tea gardens by more than 31,000 mu, transplanted and filled vacancies with more than 4.77 million seedlings, supplemented vacancies with more than 270,000 cuttings, cultivated seedlings with short cuttings on more than 1,800 mu, and established seed orchards of 6,000 mu.

Our ability to achieve such great results in tea production last year is due to the widespread application of the following in our specific work:

	(1) Adhere to the method of mass self-education and adhere to putting politics in command. There were also many ideological obstacles in our county's development of tea production. We reached ideological unity in the development of tea production through mass debates. On this basis, we implemented the spirit of continuous revolution, put forward fighting slogans and new fighting tasks in a timely manner, and inspired the masses' fighting spirit. During the tea picking period, we proposed "pick day and night, pick in the rain, and ensure that no old tea is left." During the drought resistance, we proposed "we cannot wait for rain and rely on God's grace, we must fight against nature and fight for tea against drought." In addition, the county party committee also regarded engaging in tea experimental fields as an important method for leading tea production. Last year, the county's tea "satellites" were all created by experimental fields. In our work, we also adopted large-scale mass movements, grasped both ends to bring along the middle, extensively carried out inspections and evaluations, and organized face-to-face large-scale competitions through oath-taking and leap-forward conferences, so that tea production surged wave after wave.

	(2) Strengthen tea garden management and improve cultivation level. Last year, the cultivation and weeding of each tea garden was done in a way that combined deep and shallow cultivation, and fertilization was done with more frequent applications, so that the tea trees were well-fed and well-nourished. It was changed from one cultivation, two weedings, and two fertilizations per year in the past to two cultivations, five weedings, and five fertilizations. The county also launched a campaign to protect tea trees during the winter before last year. Because fertilization was carried out in batches every season, it ensured the health of the tea trees and promoted the increase in tea production. Many "satellite" tea gardens also adopted foliar fertilization methods, which played a great role in increasing production.

	(3) Greatly break down conservative ideas and extend the picking period. Last year, in tea picking, first of all, in addition to continuing to implement advanced methods such as leaving fish leaves, topping seedlings (except for new trees), leaving belly seedlings, and cultivating lateral branches, we also resolutely promoted the method of picking in batches and multiple times through layer-by-layer special debates and on-site observations. Spring tea is generally divided into three to five batches, summer tea is divided into four to six batches, and autumn tea is picked as it grows. "Satellite" tea gardens are picked in eight to more than twenty batches. Generally, tea picking, processing, and sales are separated to ensure increased production and improved quality. Secondly, we reversed the old practice and extended the picking period. Spring tea was not only harvested seven to ten days earlier than the previous year, but the picking period was extended to twenty-five days, summer tea was extended to thirty days, and autumn tea was extended to seventy-three days, so that the proportion of summer tea to spring tea increased from 39% in 1957 to 57.1%, and autumn tea accounted for 53.04% of spring tea. At the same time, we also trial-produced broken red tea and picked wild tea. In addition, in order to improve tea picking efficiency, starting from summer tea, we learned from the advanced experience of Qimen and other places, vigorously promoted the method of picking tea with both hands throughout the county, and extensively carried out the movement of picking more than 100 jin per day.

	(4) Vigorously engage in technological innovation and realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of primary processing. Our county has promoted more than 8,500 pieces of various primary processing machinery, so that the two main processes of killing and kneading in the primary processing operation are all done by machines, and seventeen primary processing plants with a daily output of 2,000 to 7,000 jin of dry rough tea have been built. After using machinery, it reduced labor intensity, improved work efficiency, saved a large number of labor force, and solved the difficulty of insufficient labor in tea areas. Producing 100 jin of dry rough tea using semi-mechanization saves seven workdays compared to manual labor. Based on this calculation, the county can save more than one million labor days. Mechanical operation can kill at high temperature and knead fully, so it also improves quality.

In addition, overcoming natural disasters, organizing communist cooperation, building large numbers of terraced fields, maintaining water and soil, transplanting and filling vacancies, pruning, and stooling are also several important measures for our tea production to achieve large-scale bumper harvests last year.

In 1959, our county's tea production will have an even greater leap forward. The preliminary plan is to reach a total output of 290,000 dan, doubling the output of 1958. At the same time, 6,225 mu of high-yield tea gardens will be cultivated. In order to achieve this goal, we have strengthened the winter and spring soil cultivation and fertilization work to ensure that all tea gardens are carefully cultivated and managed in a garden-like manner. In addition, we must also carry out a campaign to transform old tea gardens with a focus on filling vacancies, and fundamentally change the appearance of old tea gardens. In terms of expanding the tea garden area, we will expand by another 150,000 mu this year. In addition, we must actively create and promote various types of machinery. In addition to primary processing machines, we also require that machines be gradually used in tea garden management work.

We firmly believe that with the correct leadership of the Party and the state, and the great strength of the people's communes, we have the determination and confidence to do a better job in tea production and ensure a greater harvest in tea production in 1959. (Attached picture)

    歙县茶叶大面积丰产经验
    安徽歙县人民委员会
    我县地处皖南山区，生产内容以茶、林为主，其中茶叶要占全年总收入30％，重点产茶乡、社高达80％以上，共有茶园面积十三万一千三百二十七亩，内茶粮兼作茶园六万八千四百三十二亩。广大农民经过整风运动，斗志昂扬，干劲十足，在工农业生产飞速跃进的同时，也以排山倒海之势，横扫一切困难，向茶叶高额丰产飞弛猛进。全县去年茶叶的产量比1957年实产增长了68％。一举突破战前最高年产量。平均亩产由1957年的八十九点五斤上升到一百四十四斤（以采茶面积算计），由于茶叶产量的空前提高，在公社化前，全县三百九十二个生产茶叶的社，就有三百八十五个社比前一年增产又增值。此外，在新辟和改造旧茶园方面，也取得了一些成绩，从去春起，全县扩大新茶园三万一千多亩，移栽补缺四百七十多万株，压条补缺二十七万多株，短穗扦插育苗一千八百多亩，建立留种园六千亩。
    我们所以能够取得去年茶叶生产的巨大成绩是由于在具体工作中广泛运用了：
      （一）坚持群众自我教育方法，坚持政治挂帅。我县在发展茶叶生产上也有不少思想障碍，我们通过全民大辩论，在发展茶叶生产上达到思想上的统一。在这基础上，贯彻不断革命精神，及时提出战斗口号和新的战斗任务，鼓舞群众斗志。在采茶期间提出“日夜采、冒雨采，保证不老茶”，在抗旱中提出“不能等雨靠天恩赐，要和自然斗争，向干旱争茶”。此外，县委并把搞茶叶试验田作为领导茶叶生产的重要方法之一。去年全县的茶叶卫星都是试验田创造出来的。在工作中，我们还采取大搞群众运动，抓两头带中间，广泛开展检查评比，通过誓师跃进大会，组织面对面的大竞赛等，使茶叶生产一波赶一波，一浪高一浪。
      （二）加强茶园管理，提高耕作水平。去年各茶园耕锄做到深浅相结合，施肥做到多食多餐，使茶叶吃得饱吃得好，由过去一年一耕二锄二施肥，改为二耕五锄五施肥。全县前冬还开展了保护茶树过冬运动，由于做到季季分批施肥，因此，保证了茶树健壮和促进了茶叶产量提高。不少卫星茶园还采用根外追肥方法，对增产起了很大作用。
      （三）大破保守思想，延长采摘期。去年在采茶上，首先除继续贯彻留鱼叶，打顶苗（新棵例外），留肚苗、养侧枝等先进方法外，并通过层层专题辩论，现场观摩，坚决推行分批多次采的办法，春茶一般分三至五批，夏茶四至六批，秋茶随大随采，卫星茶园分八至二十多批采。并且一般都做到采、制、售三分开，保证增加产量提高质量。其次我们一反旧例，延长了采摘期，春茶不仅比前年提早七至十天开采，而且采期延至二十五天，夏茶延至三十天，秋茶延至七十三天，使夏茶占春茶比重由1957年39％，提高到57.1％，秋茶占春茶53.04％，同时还试制了红碎茶和采了荒野茶。此外，为了提高采茶效率，从夏茶起我们学习了祁门等地先进经验，在全县范围内，大力推广双手采茶法和广泛开展日采超百斤运动。
      （四）大闹技术革新，实现初制半机械化和机械化。我县已推广各种初制机械八千五百多件，使初制操作中的杀青、揉捻两个主要工序全部用上机器，并建有日产二千——七千斤干毛茶的初制厂十七所。使用机械以后，减轻了劳动强度，提高了工效，节约了大批劳力，解决了茶区劳力不足的困难，生产百斤干毛茶，使用半机械，比手工节约七个工，以此计算，全县可节约劳力一百多万个。机械操作能高温杀青、充分揉捻，因此，还提高品质。
    此外，战胜自然灾害，组织共产主义协作，大量修建梯田，保持水土，移株补缺，修剪台刈等，也是我们去年茶叶生产获得大面积丰收的几个重要措施。
    1959年我县茶叶将有一个更大跃进，初步计划总产达二十九万担，比1958年产量翻一番，同时培养丰产茶园六千二百二十五亩。为了实现这个指标，我们加强了冬春培土施肥工作，保证全部茶园要精耕细作，实行管理园田化。另外还要开展一个以补缺为主的改造旧茶园运动，基本改变旧茶园面目。在扩大茶园面积上，今年再扩大十五万亩。此外还要积极创造和推广各类机械，除初制机器外，要求茶园管理工作上，也逐渐使用机器。
    我们坚信，有党和国家的正确领导，有人民公社的巨大力量，我们有决心、有信心把茶叶生产搞得更好，保证1959年茶叶生产取得更大的丰收。（附图片）
