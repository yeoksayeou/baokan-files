Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th. The 26th Congress of the British Communist Party today unanimously passed an emergency resolution supporting the African people's struggle for freedom.

The resolution expresses full support for the heroic struggle of the Africans in Nyasaland and expresses full support for the liberation movements of Africans in Southern and Northern Rhodesia.

The resolution vehemently condemns the Conservative government and the European immigrants in these three regions, who are colluding to carry out armed suppression and violence in order to prevent Africans from obtaining the right to vote, a higher standard of living, and the right to manage their own affairs.

The resolution states that the Congress despises the old trick of fabricating so-called "conspiracies" to cover up the imperialist armed aggression against the peoples of the colonies. The resolution emphasizes that there is no conspiracy by Africans to murder Europeans. This is a conspiracy jointly planned by European immigrants and the Conservative government to massacre African freedom fighters and destroy their movements.

The resolution states: "The increasingly high tide of the united movement for African liberation is inseparable from the British working class's struggle against British capitalism and Conservative Party policies. The monopoly companies that exploit British workers are also the monopoly companies that exploit the African people. The (British) imperial rulers who threaten the lives and living standards of the British people with aggressive war plans are also threatening and attacking the Africans. The struggle in Africa is also our struggle."

The Congress calls on the organized labor movement in Britain to awaken the nation and take concerted action to support the following demands: end the state of emergency, withdraw troops, release all arrested Africans, abolish the fascist laws of Southern Rhodesia, universal suffrage for all Africans, Nyasaland's right to secede from the federation, and recognition of the right to independence for all peoples in all African countries.

Before the resolution was passed, the Vice-Chairman of the British Communist Party, Duddell, said that the reason for submitting this draft resolution to the Congress was to express protest and indignation at the shameless actions of the British colonial authorities, the Conservative government, the Prime Minister of the Central African Federation, Welensky, and the British colonists, and to protest and be indignant at the massacres, mass arrests, and the banning of African organizations in Nyasaland and Southern and Northern Rhodesia this month.

He also said: "Submitting this draft resolution is also to express full support and solidarity with the oppressed people of Nyasaland and all the people of Central Africa in their just struggle for basic democratic rights and freedom from the rule of a white minority."

He said that all the African people have risen up, and they have declared at the great Accra All-African People's Conference that they are united in their struggle for African freedom, closely linked to the common cause of Asian-African liberation represented by the Bandung Conference, which represents the majority of mankind. He said: "In the months since the end of the Accra Conference, the struggle has been advancing in the Belgian Congo, in the French Congo, in Kenya, in Cameroon, in Somaliland, in Nyasaland, and in Central Africa."

Duddell said: "Imperialism is collapsing. Although it is not over yet." He concluded amid stormy applause: "The final victory of the liberation struggle against imperialism depends on our common struggle. Our actions will ensure that the British people do not collapse along with the dying imperialist system, but advance together with the emerging world towards the common victory of a nationally liberated and socialist Britain."

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th. The 26th Congress of the British Communist Party today continued to discuss John Gollan's political report.

Speakers expressed full support for the policies put forward in the report and pledged to work actively in their respective fields to fight for peace, against economic crisis, and to build the Party. Moffat, a leader of the Scottish miners, emphasized that only united action by workers could bring about economic and political changes, develop the struggle, and win the victory of the working class. Recently, workers have begun to unite more closely than before and take concerted action, regardless of their political views and religious beliefs. He cited the struggle against soaring rents, the London bus drivers' strike, and the miners' mass petition movement against the closure of mines as examples of the development of united action. He also called for this united action to be developed to a higher stage in the struggle for higher wages and employment, and called for more resolute efforts to build the Communist Party to lead these struggles.

Several representatives spoke about the importance of strengthening the Party's education in the struggle against the attacks of capitalism, reformism, and revisionism, and in preventing the corruption of workers.

In her speech, Nora Jeffrey emphasized that three points are very important in the struggle against capitalist propaganda: first, to clearly reflect the actual class situation of capitalist Britain; second, to understand the socialist concept of the working class seizing power; and third, to realize that none of this is possible without a strong Communist Party. She said: "Capitalism's days in Britain are numbered. History is on our side."

Campbell, the editor of the "Daily Worker," fiercely attacked the reformist ideas of the Labor Party and right-wing trade unionists. He said that objective conditions - the crisis of the capitalist world, the continuous progress of the socialist world - have never been so favorable for carrying out the ideological struggle against reformism as they are today. He said that capitalist ideas can no longer be allowed to create confusion and weaken the workers' fighting spirit in the mass movement of British workers, and reformist ideas must be eradicated from the ranks of the workers' movement. George Matthews gave a special report on the "Daily Worker" at the meeting. He emphasized the very important role of the "Daily Worker" in speaking for the British working class on all major issues and in fighting for the workers' current and long-term interests.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th. Representatives of fraternal parties from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries spoke at the 26th Congress of the British Communist Party today. The entire body of representatives expressed their warm welcome with long and sustained applause and cheers.

The representatives of the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties received a particularly warm welcome, as this was the first time that representatives of these two parties had attended a congress of the British Communist Party.

Rumyantsev, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the Congress, saying: "The British Communist Party, based on the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, has bravely faced all the tests it has encountered since its establishment, and has always stood at the forefront of the fighters for the interests of the working people of Britain. In the face of frenzied anti-communist movements and attacks by reactionary forces, the British Communists have loyally defended the ideological and organizational principles of Marxism-Leninism, crushed the revisionists, and further strengthened the ranks of the Party."

In his speech, Rumyantsev pointed out that the achievements of the British Communist Party in the two years since the last congress of the British Communist Party, as well as the developments in Britain and other capitalist countries, clearly prove the complete bankruptcy of revisionism and the correctness of the policies adopted by the British Communist Party at its 25th Congress.

Rumyantsev said that if we look at the situation of other fraternal parties, we will be convinced that despite the revisionists' attempts to distort Marxism-Leninism and to steal the leadership of our movement, the forces loyal to Marxism-Leninism have given them a decisive and devastating rebuff. The strength and maturity of the entire international communist movement have greatly increased.

After briefly describing the achievements of the Soviet Union, Rumyantsev said: "The achievements of the Soviet people are also the achievements of the international workers' movement, the victory of the great theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. These achievements and victories vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and expose the hypocrisy of all kinds of opportunist 'theories' that attempt to whitewash capitalism in their own way. The achievements of the socialist camp are winning more and more supporters to its side."

Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting and read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (the full text of the speech and congratulatory message will be published separately).

Kish Karoly, on behalf of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, conveyed to the Congress the warm congratulations of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the First Secretary of the Party, Kadar Janos. He pointed out that the existence and growth of the Hungarian workers' regime is not due to the "kindness" of the world's reactionaries and imperialist elements, but due to the strength of the Hungarian working class and its party, the Soviet Union, China, other fraternal countries, and the workers' class parties.

Kurt Seibt congratulated the Congress on behalf of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Seibt said that the German Party is leading a decisive struggle to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys. He pointed out that the lack of a democratic peace treaty facilitates the revival of reactionary forces such as militarism and fascism in West Germany.

    英共代表大会通过紧急决议
    声援非洲人民争取自由的斗争
    苏、中、匈、德等兄弟党代表向大会致贺词
    新华社伦敦28日电　英国共产党第二十六次代表大会今天一致通过声援非洲人民争取自由的斗争的紧急决议。
    决议表示完全支持尼亚萨兰非洲人的英勇斗争，并且表示全力支持南罗得西亚和北罗得西亚的非洲人的解放运动。
    决议猛烈谴责保守党政府和这三个地区的欧洲移民，他们为了不让非洲人获得选举权、较高的生活水准以及管理自己的事务的权利，而勾结起来进行武装镇压和暴力行动。
    决议说，代表大会鄙视这种老一套的伎俩：捏造什么“阴谋”来掩盖对殖民地各国人民的帝国主义武装侵略。决议着重指出，根本没有什么非洲人要谋害欧洲人的阴谋。这是欧洲移民和保守党政府为了屠杀非洲的自由战士，破坏他们的运动而共同策划的阴谋。
    决议说：“争取非洲解放的日益高涨的联合运动，同英国工人阶级反对英国资本主义和保守党政策的斗争，是分不开的。剥削英国工人的垄断公司也就是剥削非洲人民的垄断公司。以侵略战争计划威胁英国人生命和生活水准的（英）帝国统治者，也在威胁和进攻非洲人。在非洲进行的斗争也是我们的斗争。”
    代表大会号召英国有组织的劳工运动唤醒全国，采取一致行动来支持以下的要求：结束紧急状态，撤出军队，释放所有被捕的非洲人，取消南罗得西亚的法西斯法律，所有非洲人都有普遍的选举权，尼亚萨兰有脱离联邦的权利，承认非洲所有各国人民有独立的权利。
    在决议通过前，英国共产党副主席杜德说，所以向代表大会提出这个决议草案，是为了对英国殖民当局、保守党政府、中非联邦总理韦伦斯基和英国殖民者的无耻行动表示抗议和愤慨，对本月的屠杀、大逮捕、取缔尼亚萨兰和南、北罗得西亚非洲人的组织的行动表示抗议和愤慨。
    他还说：“提出这个决议草案也是为了表示全力支持和声援被压迫的尼亚萨兰人民和中非的全体人民为了争取基本民主权利和摆脱少数白种人的统治而进行的正义斗争。”
    他说，所有的非洲人民已经起来了，他们已经在伟大的阿克拉全非人民大会上宣布，他们团结一致进行争取非洲自由的斗争，同万隆会议所表现的、代表大多数人类的亚非解放共同事业密切联系。他说：“自从阿克拉大会结束以来的这几个月里，在比属刚果，在法属刚果，在怯尼亚，在喀麦隆，在索马里兰，在尼亚萨兰和中非，斗争在向前发展。
    杜德说：“帝国主义正在垮台。虽然它还没有完蛋。”他在暴风雨般的掌声中最后说：“对帝国主义进行的解放斗争的最后胜利，还要靠我们共同斗争来争取。我们的行动将使英国人民不同垂死的帝国主义制度一起垮台，而是同新兴的世界一起前进，走向民族解放和社会主义的英国的共同胜利。”
    新华社伦敦28日电　英国共产党第二十六次代表大会今天继续讨论约翰·高兰的政治报告。
    发言者表示完全支持报告中所提出的各项政策，并且保证在他们各自的工作方面积极工作，为争取和平、反对经济危机和建设党而斗争。苏格兰矿工领导人莫法特强调指出，只有工人采取联合行动，才能带来在经济和政治方面的改变，使斗争发展，并且赢得工人阶级的胜利。最近工人中已经开始比以前更紧密地团结起来，采取一致行动，而不顾彼此政治见解和宗教信仰的差别。他以反对房租暴涨的斗争、伦敦公共汽车司机的罢工以及矿工反对关闭矿井的群众性请愿运动为例，说明联合行动有了发展。他还要求在争取提高工资和就业的斗争中使这种联合行动发展到更高级的阶段，并且号召更加坚决地努力建设共产党，来领导这些斗争。
    若干代表谈到在迎击资本主义、改良主义和修正主义的进攻和防止工人腐化的斗争中，加强党的教育的重要性。
    诺拉·杰弗里在发言中强调指出，在反对资本主义宣传的斗争中，有三点是很重要的：第一，是明确地反映资本主义英国的阶级的实际情况；第二，是理解关于工人阶级取得政权的社会主义概念；第三，是了解到没有强大的共产党，这一切都不可能做到。她说：“资本主义在英国的日子已屈指可数了。历史是有利于我们的。”
    “工人日报”主编坎贝尔激烈抨击工党和右翼工会人员的改良主义思想。他说，客观条件——资本主义世界的危机，社会主义世界的不断进步——从来没有像今天这样有利于进行反对改良主义的思想斗争。他说，不能再容许资本主义思想在英国工人的群众运动中制造混乱和削弱工人的斗志，必须把工人运动队伍中的改良主义思想连根拔掉。乔治·马修斯在会上作了关于
  “工人日报”的特别报告。他强调指出了“工人日报”在一切重大问题上代表英国工人阶级说话以及在为工人的当前利益和长远利益进行斗争方面的十分重大的作用。
    新华社伦敦28日电　苏联、中国和其他国家兄弟党的代表今天在英国共产党第二十六次代表大会上讲话。大会的全体代表发出经久不息的掌声和欢呼，表示对他们的热烈欢迎。
    苏联和中国共产党的代表受到了特别热烈的欢迎，因为这是这两个党的代表第一次参加英国共产党代表大会。
    苏联共产党中央委员会委员鲁米扬采夫在代表大会上宣读苏联共产党中央委员会的贺词说：“以伟大的马克思—列宁主义原则为基础的英国共产党从成立的时候起，就一直勇敢地面对它所遭到的一切考验，并且始终站在为英国劳动人民的利益而斗争的战斗者的最前列。在疯狂的反共运动和反动势力进攻的情况下，英国共产党人忠诚地保卫了马克思—列宁主义的思想原则和组织原则，粉碎了修正主义分子，并且进一步加强了党的队伍。”
    鲁米扬采夫在他的讲话中指出，从英国共产党上次代表大会以来的两年间，英国共产党所取得的成就以及在英国和其他资本主义国家内的事态发展，明显地证明了修正主义的彻底破产，证明了英国共产党在第二十五次代表大会上所通过的方针的正确性。
    鲁米扬采夫说，如果我们看一下其他兄弟党的情况，我们就会相信，尽管修正主义分子企图对马克思列宁主义进行歪曲，企图窃取我们运动的领导地位，但是忠于马克思列宁主义的力量给了他们以决定性和毁灭性的反击。整个国际共产主义运动的力量和成熟程度都大大增加了。
    鲁米扬采夫在扼要地叙述了苏联的成就以后说：“苏联人民的成就同时也是国际工人运动的成就，是马克思、恩格斯和列宁的伟大理论的胜利。这些成就和胜利生动地证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性，揭露了形形色色的机会主义‘理论’的虚伪性，这些
  ‘理论’以自己特有的方式企图为资本主义涂脂抹粉。社会主义阵营的成就正在把愈来愈多的支持者争取到它这一方面来。”
    中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记王稼祥在会上讲话，并且宣读了中国共产党中央委员会的贺词（讲话和贺词全文另发）。
    基什·卡罗伊代表匈牙利社会主义工人党向代表大会转达了匈牙利社会主义工人党以及党的第一书记卡达尔·亚诺什个人的热烈的祝贺。他指出，匈牙利工人政权的存在和壮大并不是出于世界反动派和帝国主义分子的“好心”，而是由于匈牙利工人阶级和它的党、苏联、中国、其他兄弟国家以及工人阶级政党力量的强大。
    库尔特·赛普特代表德国统一社会党向大会祝贺。赛普特说，德国的党正在领导争取和两个德国缔结和约而进行的有决定意义的斗争。他指出，缺乏一个民主的和约便利了军国主义和法西斯主义等反动势力在西德的复活。
