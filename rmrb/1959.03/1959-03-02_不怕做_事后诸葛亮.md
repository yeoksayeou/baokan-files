Not Afraid to be a “Hindsight Expert”
    Ying Lin

    When a person makes a mistake, and only realizes what they did wrong afterward, understanding what they should have done correctly, some people often scornfully say this is being a "hindsight expert," as if such a person is useless.

    This view is actually incorrect and represents a failure to observe the issue dialectically.

    It is certainly very good when a person knows what they should do before doing something, and the actual result proves that their subjective thinking completely aligns with objective reality, thus achieving the expected effect. This is called having foresight. Foresight is the understanding of the objective laws of things. As long as a person is proficient in materialist dialectics, possesses rich practical knowledge, and is good at observing and analyzing problems using dialectical methods, it should be entirely possible to possess this kind of scientific foresight. The reason our Party consistently requires cadres to earnestly study materialist dialectics, strengthen their research into objective reality, and delve into practical matters and connect with the masses is to enable cadres to discover and grasp the objective laws of things and enhance their foresight regarding the occurrence and development of things. This way, they will be able to work with ease and make fewer mistakes.

    However, it is one thing for people to potentially foresee the direction of the development of things, and another thing to be able to actually achieve it. We know that objective things (including natural and social phenomena) are extremely complex and ever-changing, while people's understanding of things is always gradual and cannot be free from various limitations. Therefore, even for the most proficient person in dialectics, the most knowledgeable revolutionary party regarding the laws of the development of things, it is undoubtedly impossible to have foresight in every matter and never make any mistakes. People always think that Zhuge Liang was a divine strategist, with foresight in everything, but in reality, Zhuge Liang didn't have such supernatural powers. It's just that people have idealized him. Even in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, where Zhuge Liang is portrayed as being almost magical, he still made mistakes, and not small ones. That was when he misused Ma Su, who had no practical experience and only book knowledge, to defend the important strategic location of Jieting. As a result, Jieting fell, and Sima Yi's army approached the city, forcing Zhuge Liang to stage an extremely risky Empty Fort Strategy. Since neither the ancients nor modern people can achieve foresight in every matter, nor can they make their subjective and objective realities completely consistent, it is not only unsurprising but also in accordance with the laws of things to make some mistakes, large or small, and suffer some failures and setbacks in work. In "On Practice," Comrade Mao Zedong tells us this: "... Whether in the practice of changing nature or changing society, it rarely happens that people's original ideas, theories, plans, or programs are realized without any alteration. This is because people engaged in changing reality are often subject to many limitations; they are not only subject to the limitations of scientific and technological conditions, but also to the limitations of the development of the objective process itself and the degree to which it manifests itself (the aspects and essence of the objective process have not yet been fully revealed). Under these circumstances, it is common for ideas, theories, plans, or programs to be partially altered as a result of discovering unforeseen circumstances in practice, and it is also possible for them to be completely altered. That is to say, it is possible for the original ideas, theories, plans, or programs to be partially or wholly incompatible with reality, partially wrong or wholly wrong. Many times, it is necessary to fail repeatedly before erroneous knowledge can be corrected, before one can reach a point where one's knowledge is in accordance with the laws of the objective process, and thus be able to transform subjective things into objective things, that is, to achieve the desired results in practice."

    It can be seen that people not only make mistakes in practice, but only through many failures and mistakes in practice can people gain complete foresight about a certain thing, preparing the conditions for successfully doing this thing in the future. This may seem incomprehensible, but it is in accordance with dialectics. Dialectics tells us that correctness and error, success and failure, are a unity of opposites. Without error, there is no correctness; without failure, there is no success. If you fail in one practice, that is certainly a bad thing; but if it provides you with experience and lessons, increases your knowledge, and you are good at absorbing these experiences and lessons, you may be able to succeed in the next practice. Therefore, if a person wants to be a "pre-event Zhuge Liang," they must first be a good "post-event Zhuge Liang." One should not separate "pre-event" and "post-event," but rather connect them organically. Of course, things are different, and the experiences and lessons of one thing may not be fully applicable to another. But things are also interconnected, and the experiences and lessons of one thing may become a reference for doing another. Therefore, whether a person succeeds or fails in doing something, they should carefully summarize the experiences and lessons, which is of great benefit to improving our level of understanding and improving our work.

    In short, being able to be a "pre-event Zhuge Liang" is certainly good, but if that is not possible, being a "post-event Zhuge Liang" is not bad either. The worst thing is to be neither a "pre-event Zhuge Liang" nor willing to be a "post-event Zhuge Liang," not even knowing where you went wrong when you made a mistake. Such a person is truly useless.

    不怕做“事后诸葛亮”
    应麟
    当一个人做错了事，事后才发现自己错在哪里，认识到应当怎样做才对的时候，有人往往会轻蔑地说这是“事后诸葛亮”，仿佛觉得这样的人没有用处似的。
    这种看法其实是不对头的，是不会辩证地观察问题的一种表现。
    一个人在未做一件事之前，就知道应当怎样做，而且实际做的结果，证明他的主观想法完全同客观实际符合，因而收到预期的效果，这当然非常之好。这叫做有预见性。所谓预见性，就是人们对事物客观规律的认识。一个人只要精通唯物辩证法，又有丰富的实践知识，善于用辩证的方法观察问题，分析事物，要具有这种科学的预见性，应该说是完全可能的。我们党所以一贯要求干部都要认真学习唯物辩证法，都要加强对客观实际的钻研，都要深入实际和联系群众，目的就是为了使干部都能发现和掌握事物的客观规律，增强他们对事物发生和发展的预见性。这样，他们工作起来就会得心应手，少犯错误。
    但是，人们有可能预见到事物发展的方向，这是一回事，能不能做到这一点，又是一回事。我们知道，客观事物（包括自然现象和社会现象）是十分复杂的，千变万化的，而人对事物的认识总是渐进的，不能不受种种条件的限制。因此，即使是一个最精通辩证法的人，最通晓事物发展规律的革命政党，要作到在每一件事情上都有预见性，绝对不犯任何错误，无疑是不可能的。人们总以为诸葛亮料事如神，样样事情都有预见性，其实诸葛亮何尝有这样的神通，只不过是人们把他理想化了罢了，就是把诸葛亮写得神乎其神的三国演义中，他也同样犯过错误，而且是不小的错误。这就是他误用了并无实战经验只有书本知识的马谡去守要地街亭。结果街亭失陷，司马懿兵临城下，弄得诸葛亮不得不演出极端冒险的空城计来。既然不论古人或今人，都不可能作到在任何事情上都有预见性，都不可能使自己的主观和客观完全一致，可见在工作中犯一些或大或小的错误，遭受一些失败和挫折，这就不仅不足为怪，而且是合乎规律的。在“实践论”中，毛泽东同志这样告诉我们：“……不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。这是因为从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多的限制，不但常常受着科学条件和技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）。在这种情形之下，由于实践中发现前所未料的情况，因而部分地改变思想、理论、计划、方案的事是常有的，全部地改变的事也是有的。即是说，原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，部分地或全部地不合于实际，部分错了或全部错了的事，都是有的。许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能达到于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果。”
    可见，人们不仅会在实践中犯错误，而且只有通过在实践中的许多次失败和错误，才能使人们对某一事物获得完全的预见性，为以后做成功这件事准备好条件。这样说，似乎是不可理解的，但却是合乎辩证法的。辩证法告诉我们，正确和错误，成功和失败，都是对立的统一。没有错误，就没有正确，没有失败，就没有成功。在一次的实践中，你遭到失败，这固然是坏事；但是使你获得了经验教训，增长了知识，只要善于吸取这样的经验教训，你就有可能在下次的实践中成功。因此，一个人要想作“事前的诸葛亮”，就必须先作好“事后的诸葛亮”。不应把“事前”和“事后”割裂开来，而要把它们有机地联系起来。当然，事物是各不相同的，这一件事情上的经验教训，不一定完全适用于另一件事情上。但事物又是互相联系的，这一件事情上的经验教训，也有可能成为做另一件事情的借鉴。所以，一个人不论做成功或者做失败了事情，都应该认真地总结经验教训，这对提高我们的认识水平，改进我们的工作大有好处。
    总之，能够作“事前诸葛亮”固然好，如果作不到，能作“事后诸葛亮”也不错。最糟糕的莫过于，既不能作“事前诸葛亮”，也不愿做“事后诸葛亮”，做错了事连错在哪里也不知道。这样的人才真正是没有用处的。
