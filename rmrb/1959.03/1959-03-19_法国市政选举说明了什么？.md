    What Do the French Municipal Elections Show?
    By Our Special Correspondent Mario Magnan
    The French people cast their votes for the third time since De Gaulle came to power on March 8th and March 15th. This time it was the municipal elections, in other words, the election of municipal committees in 38,000 towns and cities across the country.
    The elections are conducted according to candidate lists, based on different voting systems: proportional representation in the capital Paris, with only one round of voting; proportional representation in the twelve cities with a population of more than 120,000, generally with one round of voting; and majority voting in other towns and cities, with two rounds of voting.
    In the September 1958 "referendum," votes in favor of the De Gaulle constitution accounted for 80% of the total, but these votes were equivalent to votes for General De Gaulle personally. Then, parliamentary elections were held in November 1958. Right-wing elements, using De Gaulle to mask reactionary and colonial war policies, obtained a "victory" by means of deception and civil war blackmail, exploiting the division of constituencies and the two-round majority voting system, which opened the door to despicable activities. This electoral system deprived the Communist Party of nearly 140 seats in the National Assembly (only ten communists were elected as members of the National Assembly), although the Communist Party received 3,882,000 votes, while De Gaulle's party, which held 188 seats, received only 3,600,000 votes.
    Now, after several months of De Gaulle's rule, more French voters have voted for the Communist Party. In many areas, the electoral law's traps have harmed its founders.
    After General De Gaulle's party, which launched a coup by force, gained a "victory" in the National Assembly elections in November 1958, the French bourgeoisie hoped to drive the communists out of the municipal committees, especially from the municipal committees in what they called the "red zone" of the Paris suburbs. The slogan of the De Gaulle party, the extreme nationalist "Union for the New Republic," was "Attack the municipal committees and expel the communists."
    This proposition means that the French big bourgeoisie has launched a real offensive against the working class and the working people of France, and it also means that the coup that guided De Gaulle to power in 1958 was in the service of big banks. Those who hailed De Gaulle as a "savior" in 1958 are still boasting that the French people have silently accepted economic dictatorship and personal autocracy, and they are still touting that the policies of the party with the De Gaulle label are correct.
    However, the decrees promulgated by the government serving the big capitalists, which attack the living standards of the masses, have caused serious damage to the masses of the people and have made them recall the illusions they had during the "referendum" in September 1958. Now, social insurance has been hit, veterans' pensions have been canceled, the economic crisis has caused workers to be laid off (and the threat of unemployment has been used as a pretext for attacking wages), taxes have increased, rents have risen, and prices have skyrocketed due to the devaluation of the franc.
    All this has certainly aroused dissatisfaction. In January and February, veterans' marches in Paris and other cities expressed this dissatisfaction. Then, a strike movement against forced layoffs was launched, and soon after, a collective demonstration against the cancellation of medical expense compensation for social insurance recipients took place. Due to rising living costs, demands for wage increases are becoming increasingly strong.
    De Gaulle, the "savior," not only failed to fulfill the expectations of the voters in September and November 1958 to end the Algerian war, but on the contrary, this war has become more and more cruel and bloody. De Gaulle and his government, instead of adopting a policy of peace and easing international tensions, have adopted a policy of forming an alliance with the Adenauer group, which has aroused resentment among the French people.
    Faced with the fierce offensive of the reactionary forces, the French Communist Party maintains close ties with the masses. The French bourgeoisie, with the support of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, intends to completely isolate the French Communist Party. However, the French Communists have mobilized to defend the municipal system as they defend the "fortress of republic and democratic freedom," against personal autocracy and against the reactionary forces of capitalists and colonialists. The Communist Party announced a program that fully meets the needs of the masses who have shattered their illusions:
    ——Achieve peace in Algeria through negotiations, reduce military spending, and strive for France's independence, in other words, withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;
    ——Improve the living standards of working people and protect purchasing power;
    ——Implement democratic tax reform and abolish the anti-social and anti-democratic decrees adopted since June 1;
    ——Strive to achieve democratic reform and implement innovative democracy.
    In addition to the above-mentioned program of national salvation, the municipal election program also includes demands regarding housing, school buildings, summer camps, and relief undertakings.
    One of the topics of the election campaign was to condemn the suffering brought to the French people since the armed forces in Algiers launched a coup on May 13, 1958, and to condemn the collusion of pseudo-socialists like Mollet, dividers of democratic forces, and supporters of war and poverty.
    The Communists pointed out to the voters that, based on their experience, they should elect the most capable municipal personnel who are most capable of defending the welfare of the residents. The Communists asked the voters to use their votes to block personal military dictatorship and fascist adventures, and to stop anti-communist and anti-people conspiracies.
    The lists of the "Republican Alliance" uniting candidates from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and other left-wing parties appeared in dozens of cities.
    On March 8, male and female voters expressed their attitudes.
    For the De Gaulle group, this was a heavy blow.
    The party that relies on the armed coup in Algeria as its backing and has received De Gaulle's open support suffered a fierce blow only four months after deceiving voters for a "victory" in November 1958. In general, the "Union for the New Republic" lost no less than hundreds of thousands of votes.
    In Paris, compared with the 1958 elections, the "Union for the New Republic" lost 64,700 votes. In Lyon, despite the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Soustelle, one of the organizers of the Algiers conspiracy, as a candidate and his conspiracy activities, the "Union for the New Republic" lost 12,000 votes.
    The "Independent Party" - this is a party under the wings of the big trust forces, and one of its leaders is Finance Minister Pinay. Compared with November 1958, the Independent Party also lost votes. The same is true for the Socialists.
    In large cities with a population of more than 120,000, the "Union for the New Republic" had 25% of the votes in the parliamentary elections in November 1958, and on March 8, its votes dropped to 18%.
    However, on the contrary, the Communist Party regained voters who had been deceived into believing in De Gaulle. Moreover, the Communist Party also gained some voters who had never voted for the Communist Party, and these people were indignant at discovering that they had been deceived by De Gaulle.
    This situation shows that the victories gained by the Communist Party in various places are very significant. In about 1,400 municipal committees, the Communists maintained their position, and in other municipal committees, the Communist Party's strength increased.
    In Paris, the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party was 52,000 more than in the 1958 parliamentary elections, totaling 327,458, accounting for 29% of the total votes, ranking first among all parties in Paris. The Communist Party won 29 municipal council seats in Paris (out of a total of 90 seats), one more than in 1953.
    In the Seine district of Paris, the Communists won an absolute majority, occupying 25 seats. The reactionary faction suffered the most severe blow here because, in the past, the Communist Party managed the administration of this district in cooperation with other small parties, and according to the electoral law originally intended to attack the Communists, there are no longer minority seats, so the district is completely managed by the Communist Party alone. The electoral law excluding the Communist Party has struck its creators.
    In major cities outside Paris, the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party was also much higher than in 1958. The Communist Party gained 18,900 more votes in Marseille, 10,120 more in Le Havre, and 5,000 more in Lyon. In medium-sized cities and villages, the Communist Party's votes also increased. In general, the Communist Party's votes accounted for 19.5% of the total in 1958, while the votes on March 8 accounted for 27.7% of the total. In the Paris suburbs and some cities in other provinces, the proportion of votes obtained by the Communist Party was 60%, 68%, 70%, and 72%, and in two places, the Communist Party's votes reached as high as 96.4% and 98%!
    The "Die Welt" in Hamburg declared with good reason that March 9 was "De Gaulle's first defeat, which may not be decisive, but must not be ignored."
    Despite the collusion of reactionary forces, it is clear that the second round of voting in the municipal elections cannot change the general trend of the rise of the French communist movement. In recent months, the focus of the struggle has been on improving the living conditions of the working class and the masses, and opposing autocratic totalitarianism and monopoly capital. The municipal elections should be viewed from the perspective of the French and international situation. The De Gaulle regime has suffered its first blow.

### 法国市政选举说明了什么？

    法国市政选举说明了什么？
    本报特约记者　马里奥·马尼安
    法国人民于3月8日及3月15日举行自戴高乐执政以来第三次的投票。这一次是市政选举，换而言之，就是选举全国三万八千个市镇的市政委员会。
    选举是依照候选人名单、根据不同的投票制进行的：在首都巴黎按比例投票制，只举行一轮投票；在人口为十二万人以上的十二个城市里，一般也按比票投票制，一轮投票；在其他的市镇里则采用多数投票制，二轮投票。
    1958年9月的“公民投票”，戴高乐宪法的赞成票占总票数的80％，不过，这些赞成票等于向戴高乐将军个人投的票。接着，1958年11月举行了议会选举。利用戴高乐以掩饰反动与殖民战争政策的右翼分子，凭借欺骗与内战的讹诈，利用划分选区以及为卑鄙活动大开方便之门的二轮多数投票制，获得了“胜利”。这个选举制度夺走了共产党在国民议会中近一百四十个议席（当选为国民议会议员的共产党人只有十名），虽然共产党获得了三百八十八万二千张票，而占有一百八十八个议席的戴高乐的政党仅获得三百六十万张票。
    现在，经历了几个月的戴高乐的统治之后，有更多的法国选民投了共产党的票。在不少的地区，选举法的陷阱使它的创始人自蒙其害。
    1958年11月，以武力发动政变的、戴高乐将军的政党在国民议会选举中获得“胜利”以后，法国的资产阶级就希望从市政委员会、尤其是从他们所谓的巴黎郊区“红色地带”的市政委员会中，把共产党人赶掉。戴高乐分子的政党、极端民族主义分子“保卫新共和联盟”的口号，就是“向市政委员会进攻、驱逐共产党人。”
    这种主张意味着法国的大资产阶级向工人阶级、向全法国的劳动人民展开了真正的进攻，也意味着1958年导引戴高乐上台的武力政变是为大银行服务的。那些在1958年把戴高乐捧为
  “救主”的人，还在吹嘘说法国人民已经默默地接受了经济的独裁、个人的专制，他们还在标榜说，具有戴高乐标记的政党的政策是正确无误的。
    可是，为大资本家服务的政府所颁布的向人民群众生活水平进攻的法令，已经使人民群众蒙受严重的损害，并且使他们回忆起1958年9月“公民投票”时期他们所具有的幻想。现在，社会保险受了打击，退伍军人年金被取消了，经济危机引起了工人的被解雇（而失业的危险竟被用来作为对工资进攻的口实），捐税增加了，房租上涨了，由于法郎贬值物价扶摇直上。
    这一切当然引起了不满。在1、2月里，巴黎和其他城市退伍军人的游行就表达了这种不满的情绪。接着，展开了反对强迫停工的罢工运动，不久以后，又发生了反对取消社会保险者医疗费补偿金的集体示威。由于生活费用上涨，增加工资的要求也愈来愈强烈了。
    戴高乐“救主”不但没有满足选民们在1958年9月与11月的期望、终止阿尔及利亚战争，相反地，这个战争愈来愈残酷、流血愈来愈多。戴高乐和他的政府，不但没有采取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的政策，反而采取了一个引起法国人民反感的、与阿登纳集团建立联盟的政策。
    面临着反动势力猛烈进攻的法国共产党，与人民群众保持着密切的联系。法国资产阶级在社会党右翼首脑的支持下，打算把法国共产党完全孤立起来。可是，法国共产党人动员起来，像保卫“共和与民主自由的堡垒”那样，保卫着市政制度，反对个人专制，反对资本家和殖民主义者的反动势力。共产党公布了一个完全符合破除了幻想的人民群众的纲领：
    ——通过谈判在阿尔及利亚实现和平，削减军费，争取法国的独立，换言之，退出北大西洋公约；
    ——提高劳动人民生活水平，保护购买力；
    ——实行捐税民主改革，废除自6月1日以来所采取的反社会、反民主的法令；
    ——争取实现民主改革，实行革新的民主制。
    在市政选举纲领中，除了以上列举的救国纲领以外，还包括有关于房屋、校舍、夏令营、救济事业这些方面的要求。
    选举运动的一项课题是谴责自1958年5月13日阿尔及尔武装力量发动政变以来，给法国人民带来的苦难，谴责像摩勒这样的伪社会主义者、民主力量分裂者、战争与贫穷的支持人的共谋。
    共产党人向选民们指出，应该根据他们的经验，选出最能保卫居民福利的、最有能力的市政人员。共产党人要求选民们用他们的选票来堵塞个人军事独裁和法西斯冒险，制止反共、反人民的阴谋。
    团结着共产党、社会党、激进社会党和其他左翼党派候选人的“共和主义者联盟”的名单，在几十个城市里出现了。
    3月8日，男女选民们表示了态度。
    对戴高乐集团说来，这是一个沉重的打击。
    哪个依赖阿尔及利亚的武力政变为后盾、并且得到了戴高乐的公开支持的政党，距离它在1958年11月期间骗取选票的“胜利”仅仅只有四个月，就遭受了猛烈的打击。总的说来，“保卫新共和联盟”丧失的选票不下数十万张。
    在巴黎，与1958年选举比较起来，“保卫新共和联盟”丧失了六万四千七百张选票。在里昂，虽然有副总理、阿尔及尔阴谋组织者之一苏斯戴尔作为候选人和他的阴谋活动，“保卫新共和联盟”丧失了一万二千张选票。
    “独立党人”——这是在大托拉斯势力翼卵下的政党，它的一个首脑就是财政部长比内。与1958年11月比较起来，独立党人也丧失了选票。社会党人也是这样。
    在人口超过十二万人的大城市里，1958年11月议会选举的时候，“保卫新共和联盟”拥有25％的选票，3月8日，它的选票降为18％。
    可是，相反地，共产党却重新获得了受骗相信了戴高乐的选民。而且，共产党还获得一些从未投过共产党的票的选民，这些人因为发现自己上了戴高乐的当而感到愤慨。
    这种情况说明共产党在各地获得的胜利是十分巨大的。在一千四百个左右的市政委员会中，共产党人保持了地位，在其他的市政委员会中，增加了共产党的力量。
    在巴黎，共产党所得的票数，比1958年议会选举时多五万二千张，共得三十二万七千四百五十八张，占总票数的29％，居巴黎各党派的首位。共产党赢得巴黎市政委员会中二十九个市政委员席位（总数为九十席），比1953年多一席。
    在巴黎塞纳区，共产党人赢得了绝对的多数，占有二十五个席位。反动派在这里遭受的打击最为严重，因为，过去共产党是在与其他小党派合作的情况下，管理这个区的行政的，而根据本来旨在打击共产党人的选举法，现在不再有少数派的议席，因此，完全由共产党单独管理。排斥共产党的选举法打击了它的创立人。
    在外省各大城市里，共产党所得的票数，也比1958年的大为增加。共产党在马赛多得了一万八千九百张，在哈佛尔多得了一万零一百二十张，在里昂多得了五千张。在中等城市和村镇里，共产党的得票也有增加。总的说来，1958年共产党得票占总数的19.5％，而3月8日的得票占总数的27.7％。在巴黎郊区和外省若干城市中，共产党得票的比例为60％、68％、70％、72％，有两处地方，共产党的得票竟高达96.4％和98％！
    汉堡的“世界报”不无理由地宣称，3月9日是“戴高乐的第一次失败，这个失败也许还不是决定性的，但是决不能予以忽视。”
    尽管有反动力量的纠合，显然市政选举的第二轮投票也不可能改变法国共产主义运动高涨的一般趋势。最近几个月以来，斗争的重点在于改进工人阶级、人民群众的生活状况、反对专制极权与垄断资本。应当从法国国内外局势来看待这次市政选举。戴高乐政权受到了第一次的打击。
