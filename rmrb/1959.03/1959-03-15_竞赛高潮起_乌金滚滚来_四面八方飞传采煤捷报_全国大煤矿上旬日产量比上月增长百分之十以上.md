Xinhua News Agency, March 14th - Coal mine workers across the country are fully engaged in a large-scale high-yield red flag competition, with widespread production successes reported in all mines in the first ten days of March. According to materials from the Production Dispatch Office of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the total average daily output of major coal mines nationwide increased by 10.25% compared to February, with over 70% of coal mines exceeding their February daily production levels. Among them, the Fushun, Beipiao, Fuxin, Zibo, Xishan, Pingdingshan, and Fangzi mining bureaus performed best in completing their production tasks.

Since the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Central People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a national coal mine worker red flag competition broadcast rally on March 2nd, coal mine workers across the country, after discussions, successively held mobilization rallies and organized red flag competitions between mines, districts, shifts, and groups, sparking a new upsurge in production. Zibo, Fushun, and other units that mobilized earlier and more effectively have had over 90% of their workers participate in the competition. Among the 1,943 production teams in the Zibo Mining Bureau, 1,282 teams completed their competition plans in the first ten days of March, increasing the mine's daily output level from over 18,000 tons in February to over 22,000 tons. Workers at the Fushun Mining Bureau also exceeded their production plan for the first ten days by 16.76% in the competition.

Party committees and leading Party and government cadres in various localities personally took charge, went deep into the grassroots to mobilize the masses, and assisted in solving key production problems, which is the main reason for the general increase in production in coal mines across the country. All four secretaries of the CPC Fushun Municipal Committee were dispatched, and together with the Party and government leading cadres of the Fushun Mining Bureau, formed five working groups and two mobile working groups, which went to various mines and lived, ate, and worked alongside the workers, leading production in the process. Shen Yue, Secretary of the CPC Fushun Municipal Committee, discovered that some electric locomotives were broken at the Xilutian Mine and the mining area was unable to repair them on its own, so he immediately organized the city's machinery factories to assist in the repairs. Seeing that many small coal carts were broken, affecting production, he immediately assigned a special person to be responsible for solving the problem, and by the 9th, 160 carts had been repaired. The Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau moved meetings to study production and mobilize the masses from above ground to underground in order not to affect production, which was very popular with the workers.

Most coal mines organized high-yield working faces in the form of experimental plots during the red flag competition to set an example for large-scale bumper harvests. The Datong Mining Bureau organized fifteen high-yield working faces. The Fenxi Mining Bureau organized sixteen. The Zibo Mining Bureau cultivated fifty-seven experimental high-yield plots, and seventeen have already reached high-yield targets.

Various coal mines vigorously promoted the advanced experiences that had been effective last year. The Hongshan Mine and the Xihe Mine of the Zibo Mining Bureau lengthened the cutting discs of fourteen coal cutting machines, increasing the average daily output by 600 tons. In order to increase daily output levels, many coal mines also actively rectified labor organization and strengthened mining and excavation work. The Zibo Mining Bureau transferred more than 1,000 auxiliary workers and newly opened nine working faces. The Jixi Mining Bureau increased the number of underground production workers by 2,000.

At present, the morale of coal mine workers in various localities is very high. They are determined to fight even better battles in the middle and last ten days of March to ensure the completion of the production plan for the first quarter. (Attached pictures)

    竞赛高潮起  乌金滚滚来
    四面八方飞传采煤捷报
    全国大煤矿上旬日产量比上月增长百分之十以上
    新华社14日讯　全国煤矿职工全力展开大面积丰产红旗竞赛，3月上旬各矿生产普遍告捷。根据煤炭工业部生产调度室的材料，全国大煤矿的总平均日产量比2月份增长了10.25％，70％以上的煤矿日产水平超过了2月份。其中又以抚顺、北票、阜新、淄博、西山、平顶山、坊子等矿务局的生产任务完成得最好。
    自从煤炭工业部和中央人民广播电台在3月2日联合召开全国煤矿职工红旗竞赛广播大会以后，全国各地煤矿职工经过讨论，都先后举行了誓师比武大会，组织了矿与矿、区与区、班与班、组与组之间的红旗竞赛，掀起了新的生产高潮。动得比较早、比较好的淄博、抚顺等单位，已经有90％以上的职工参加了竞赛。在淄博矿务局的一千九百四十三个生产小组中，有一千二百八十二个小组在3月上旬完成了竞赛计划，使全矿日产水平由2月份的一万八千多吨上升到两万二千多吨；抚顺矿务局职工在竞赛中也超额16.76％完成了上旬生产计划。
    各地党委和各矿党政领导干部亲自挂帅，深入基层发动群众和协助解决生产上的关键问题，是各地煤矿能够普遍提高生产的主要原因。中共抚顺市委四个书记全部出动，和抚顺矿务局的党政领导干部共同组成五个工作组和两个流动工作组，分赴各矿和工人同吃同住同劳动，在生产中领导生产。中共抚顺市委书记沈越在西露天矿发现有些电机车坏了，矿区无力自修，就立刻组织全市机器厂协助修理；看到不少小煤车坏了，影响了生产，就立刻派专人负责解决，到9日为止已经修好了一百六十台。抚顺矿务局局长为了不影响生产，把研究生产的会、发动群众的会都从井上搬到井下去开，很受工人欢迎。
    大部分煤矿在组织红旗竞赛中，都用种试验田的方式组织高产工作面，为大面积丰收树立榜样。大同矿务局组织了十五个高产工作面。汾西矿务局组织了十六个。淄博矿务局培养了五十七个试验丰产田，目前已经有十七个达到了丰产指标。
    各煤矿大力推广了去年行之有效的先进经验。淄博矿务局洪山矿和西河矿把十四台截煤机的截盘加长，平均每天增加产量六百吨。为了提高日产水平，许多煤矿还积极整顿劳动组织，加强采掘工作。淄博矿务局抽调一千多个辅助工，新开了九个工作面。鸡西矿务局增加了两千个井下生产工人。
    目前，各地煤矿职工士气非常旺盛，他们决心在3月中旬、下旬打更漂亮的仗，保证完成第一季度的生产计划。（附图片）
