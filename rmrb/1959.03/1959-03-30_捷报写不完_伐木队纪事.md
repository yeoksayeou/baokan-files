Endless Good News
——Chronicle of a Logging Team
Wang Zhuyu

Just as the sky began to brighten, the area in front of the logging headquarters was already packed with people, bustling and lively as if celebrating a festival. People were there to inquire about the news of the Second Logging Company's new record.

On the desk in the headquarters lay a dazzling large red paper, with a large, dark "Victory" character whose ink was not yet dry. This was a report of good news to the higher Party committee, neatly written: "…Yesterday, the three-person team of the No. 18 saw of the Second Company, after twelve hours of hard work, created a high-yield record of 811 cubic meters of manual logging… This is the first miracle created by the logging army in the Wanda Mountains…"

Secretary Wang looked at the report again and again, read it over and over, and finally, he told the statistician thoughtfully: "I will personally deliver this report so that I can report some specific situations to the leaders in person." Before he finished speaking, the telephone rang. The statistician picked up the receiver. "Hello, looking for Secretary Wang." He handed the receiver to Secretary Wang and added, "It's from the First Company, probably inquiring about the Second Company's new record."

Secretary Wang had only spoken a few words to the person on the other end when a look of surprise appeared on his face, and he asked loudly, "How much, say it again,… ha, 1219 cubic meters, has the work efficiency been verified?… It’s the No. 50 saw… three people… eleven hours of intense battle… Good…" Secretary Wang repeated each sentence, receiving affirmative answers from the other end each time, and only then did he feel relieved. At this moment, there were cheers inside and outside the room: "Breaking the 1,000 cubic meter mark!"

For a long, long time, people quieted down. Secretary Wang was as happy as if he had fought an "annihilation battle" in the army in the past. He shouted:
"Quick, quickly revise the good news report, no, write another one, with a big brush, on big paper…" Before this report was finished, the telephone rang again. The statistician picked up the headset and almost jumped up. He spoke to the other party in a voice as loud as shouting a slogan: "…Logging team from the Agricultural University… How much?… A circular saw, what?… Ah, created 2,761 cubic meters of manual logging!" This good news once again set off waves of joy among the people. Someone outside the door set off firecrackers, and young people were singing and dancing joyfully…

Secretary Wang, beaming with joy, picked up the report and walked outside.
"Hey, Secretary, the second one hasn't been finished yet!"
"Don't write it, the good news is endless."
"Well… this third and greatest piece of good news should still be written down."
"This one is written in my heart… Then you can write a report to the People's Daily…" Secretary Wang said, taking a big step out the door, but he looked back at the telephone that "transmitted the good news three times" before hurrying away from this "front-line command."

The people fighting in the Great Northern Wilderness, in the frigid north of the motherland, in the desolate Wanda Mountains, beat the war drums, planted red flags everywhere, and scattered this glorious red good news report high, high into space, far away, and towards Beijing!

    捷报写不完
    ——伐木队纪事
    王主玉
    天刚亮，伐木指挥部的门前，就挤满了人，熙熙攘攘，像过节日一样的热闹。人们是来打听关于伐木二连创造新纪录的消息的。
    指挥部的办公桌上，放着一张耀眼的大红纸，上面的那个又大又黑的?字，墨迹未干。这是一封向上级党委报捷的喜报，上面工整地写着：“……昨天二连十八号锯的三人小组，奋战十二小时，创造人工伐木八百一十一立方的高产纪录……这是伐木大军在完达山上创造的第一个奇迹……。”
    王书记把这张捷报看了又看，读了又读，最后，他若有所思地告诉统计员：“这张捷报我自己送去，好把一些具体情况再当面向首长汇报。”话音未落，电话铃响了，统计员拿起听筒，“喂，找王书记。”他把听筒递给王书记，并顺便说明一句：“一连来的，大概是询问关于二连创造新纪录的事。”
    王书记和对方刚讲几句话，脸上便现出惊喜的神情，并大声反问：“多少，再说一遍，……呵，一千二百一十九立方，工效核对了没有？……是五十号锯……三个人……十一小时的激战……好的……”王书记一句一句地复述着，句句得到对方肯定的答复，他才放心。这时，屋里屋外一片欢呼声：“破千方大关了！”
    好久，好久，人们才安静下来。王书记高兴得像过去在部队上打了个“歼灭战”一样，他大声招呼：
  “快，快改捷报，不，再写一张，用大笔，用大纸……。”这张捷报还没写完，电话铃又响了。统计员拿过耳机，几乎蹦了起来，他用高呼口号的嗓音给对方讲话：“……农业大学伐木队……多少？……一盘锯，什么？……啊，创造人工伐木二千七百六十一立方！”这个喜讯，又一次掀起人们欢乐的浪潮，不知是谁在门外放起鞭炮来了，年轻人在纵情歌舞……
    王书记红光满面，拿起捷报就向外走。
    “喂，书记，第二张还没写完哪！”
    “不写啦，捷报是写不完的。”
    “那……这第三个最大的捷报，还是写了好。”
    “这个在我心里写好了；……那你们就给人民日报写个报道吧……”王书记说着大步跨出门外，但他又回头看了看那部“三传捷报”的电话机，才匆忙地离开这个“前线司令部”。
    战斗在北大荒的人们，在祖国严寒的北方，在荒无人烟的完达山上，把战鼓擂响，把红旗插遍，把这张光辉夺目的红色喜报，高高地、高高地撒向太空，撒向远方，撒向北京！
