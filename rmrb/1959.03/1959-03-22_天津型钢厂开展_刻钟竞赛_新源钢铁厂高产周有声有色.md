    Tianjin Steel Plant Launches "Quarter-Hour Competition"
    Xinyuan Steel Plant's High-Yield Week is Lively and Colorful
    Yili Daily, March 21st: Responding to the call of the national steelworkers' high-yield and high-quality broadcast competition, the workers of the Xinyuan Steel Plant in Xinjiang launched a vigorous high-yield week campaign. Under the heroic slogan of "Learn from Benxi, Catch up with Benxi, and Vow to Win the National High-Yield Red Flag for Blast Furnaces," the utilization coefficient of the No. 2 eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace has been rising steadily in recent days. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached an advanced standard of 2.635 on March 18th.
    The Xinyuan Steel Plant is located on the Gongnaisi Grassland in the Yili Autonomous Prefecture, on the most remote border of the motherland, and is a small steel plant that was established last National Day. The equipment in this plant is old and simple. Under the leadership of the plant's Party committee, workers of all ethnic groups have worked hard and cleverly to continuously increase the output of pig iron. Among them, the utilization coefficient of the No. 2 eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace was 0.81 in January, and the coke ratio was 1.63; by March 14th, the utilization coefficient had reached a level of 1.64, and the coke ratio had been reduced to 0.99.
    In response to the call of the national steelworkers' high-yield and high-quality broadcast competition, the plant's workers launched a competition upsurge centered on technological innovation. The Party committee secretary and plant director followed the shifts to work. Since March 15th, the No. 2 blast furnace has continuously set new records for four consecutive days. At present, under the leadership of the plant's Party committee, workers of all ethnic groups in the plant are riding the waves and striding forward, vowing to create even greater records and fight to overfulfill the target of 18 million tons of steel.

    天津型钢厂开展“刻钟竞赛”
    新源钢铁厂高产周有声有色
    伊犁日报21日电　新疆新源钢铁厂职工响应全国钢铁职工高产优质广播竞赛大会号召，开展了声势浩大的高产周运动。在学本溪赶本溪誓夺全国高炉高产红旗的豪迈口号下，二号八立方公尺小高炉的利用系数连日来直线上升。3月18日的高炉利用系数达到了二点六三五先进标准。
    新源钢铁厂位于祖国最边远的伊犁自治州巩乃斯草原上，是去年国庆节诞生的一个小型钢铁厂。这个厂的设备陈旧简陋，各族职工在厂党委的领导下，苦干加巧干，使生铁产量不断上升。其中二号八立方公尺小高炉元月份利用系数是零点八一，焦比是一点六三；到3月14日利用系数就达到了一点六四的水平，焦比降低到了零点九九。
    为了响应全国钢铁职工高产优质广播竞赛大会号召，该厂职工掀起以技术革新为中心的竞赛热潮。党委书记厂长跟班劳动，从15日起，二号高炉连续四天创新纪录。目前全厂各族职工在厂党委的领导下乘风破浪阔步前进，誓创更大纪录，为超额完成一千八百万吨钢而战。
