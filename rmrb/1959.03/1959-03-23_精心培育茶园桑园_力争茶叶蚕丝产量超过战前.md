Xinhua News Agency Report: Strive to have tea and tussah silk cocoons exceed the highest pre-war annual output this year, and mulberry silk cocoons strive to double or so. This is the production target proposed at the National Tea and Silk Production Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing.

Our country is a world-renowned producer of tea and silk cocoons. However, for a long period before liberation, the tea and silk industries had been declining. As a result, in 1949, tea production was only slightly more than 820,000 dan, mulberry silk cocoons were less than 620,000 dan, and tussah silk cocoons were less than 240,000 dan. Since liberation, they have been recovering year by year, but none have yet recovered to half of the highest pre-war annual output. The main reason is that the reclamation and development of tea and mulberry gardens cannot be effective in the short term.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, tea production increased by 27% compared to 1957, mulberry silk cocoons increased by 19%, and tussah silk cocoons increased by 27%. The National Tea and Silk Production Conference believes that the leap forward in 1958 is not only reflected in output but in many aspects. All of these have laid the foundation for a greater leap forward this year.

The conference believes that the key to completing this year's leap forward task is to strengthen the cultivation of tea and mulberry gardens in accordance with the requirements of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and strive to achieve high yields over large areas. In terms of tea, the current focus should be on a concentrated effort to seize spring tea, and later on the picking and production of summer and autumn tea. In terms of mulberry silkworms, the current focus should be on vigorously fertilizing mulberry gardens and raising spring silkworms, first striving for high yields of mulberry leaves and spring silkworms, and ensuring that spring silkworms complete more than 60% of this year's leap forward targets; then widely promoting the raising of summer and autumn silkworms, promoting fast and economical silkworm raising methods, and innovating silkworm raising techniques. In terms of tussah silk cocoons, it is necessary to vigorously reclaim tussah slopes and tap the potential of tussah slopes, and release a large number of silkworms.

In order to ensure the realization of this year's Great Leap Forward, the conference also adopted eight proposals to the national people's communes on tea production and ten proposals on silkworm cocoon production. At the meeting, the representatives of Jiangsu Province also proposed to carry out competitions with Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guangdong and other major silkworm raising areas. Jiangsu Province proposed that this year's silkworm cocoon production should catch up with Zhejiang and exceed Sichuan and Guangdong.

### 精心培育茶园桑园  力争茶叶蚕丝产量超过战前

    精心培育茶园桑园
    力争茶叶蚕丝产量超过战前
    据新华社讯　茶叶和柞蚕茧要力争在今年超过战前的最高年产量，桑蚕茧要力争翻一番左右。这是最近农业部在北京召开的全国茶叶、蚕丝生产会议提出的生产指标。
    我国是世界上著名的出产茶叶和蚕茧的国家。但是，解放以前的很长一个时期，茶业和蚕业就已日趋衰落。以致1949年茶叶的产量仅八十二万担多点，桑蚕茧不到六十二万担，柞蚕茧不到二十四万担。解放以来逐年恢复，但都还没有恢复到战前最高年产量的一半。主要原因是茶园和桑园的垦复和发展，都不是短期能够见效的事。
    1958年大跃进中，茶叶比1957年增产了27％，桑蚕茧增产了19％，柞蚕茧增产了27％。全国茶叶和蚕业生产会议认为，1958年的跃进不仅表现在产量方面，而是多方面的。所有这些都为今年更大跃进打下了基础。
    会议认为：完成今年跃进任务的关键，是照农业八字宪法的要求加强对茶园和桑园的培育，力争实现大面积高产。茶叶方面当前要突击抓春茶，以后还要抓夏秋茶的采制。桑蚕方面当前要大抓桑园施肥和饲养春蚕，首先争取桑叶和春蚕高产，保证春蚕完成今年跃进指标的60％以上；然后广泛地推广饲养夏秋蚕，推广快省养蚕法和革新养蚕技术。柞蚕茧方面要大力垦复柞坡和发挥柞坡潜力，大量放养。
    为保证实现今年的大跃进，会议还通过了给全国人民公社的关于茶叶生产的八项倡议和蚕茧生产的十项倡议。会上，江苏省代表还提出要与浙江、四川和广东等主要养蚕区开展竞赛。江苏省提出今年的蚕茧产量要追上浙江，超过四川和广东。
