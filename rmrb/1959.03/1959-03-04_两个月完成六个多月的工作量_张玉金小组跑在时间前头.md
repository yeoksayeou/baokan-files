Completing Six Months' Worth of Work in Two Months
    Zhang Yujin Team Runs Ahead of Time
    (Our dispatch) The Zhang Yujin forging team of the Dalian Shipyard completed six months and twenty days' worth of work in the forty-eight actual working days of January and February this year.

    This team, which was rated as a Red Flag unit last year for completing more than one year and eight months' worth of work, recently summarized its experience of the Great Leap Forward last year and decided to advance victoriously, aiming to complete thirty-two months' worth of work this year. Their achievements and their ambition to strive for a greater leap forward have become a model for many workers and staff in the Lüda City to learn from.

    The primary factor in this team's outstanding achievements in production at the beginning of this year is maximizing the utilization rate of the steam hammer. When reviewing their work last year, in addition to affirming their experiences, they believed that the main shortcoming was poor tool preparation. For example, red-hot blanks were often taken out of the furnace and placed on the drill, but often the tools could not be found, causing the blanks to turn greyish-black and having to be reheated, which wasted a lot of time. At the beginning of this year, they were determined to eliminate this phenomenon. One day, the workshop assigned more than twenty kinds of work. With so many different types of work, there were also many tools needed. The whole team understood this situation, and everyone worked together to prepare the tools and dies the night before. The next day, when they started work, the tools were neatly arranged and easy to use, and the work progressed smoothly, one link after another. This greatly reduced the downtime of the steam hammer. Work that used to take sixteen or even twenty-four hours to complete can now be completed in eight hours.

    The Zhang Yujin team makes every effort to improve tools according to production needs. Last year, they innovated a total of ninety-five types, and this year they have already put forward twenty-one innovation suggestions. By constantly paying attention to technological innovation, production efficiency has been greatly improved. Last year, they forged chain plates for ships, and after countless improvements in tools and operating methods, they increased efficiency to a daily output of one hundred and fifteen pieces. In February of this year, thanks to further improvements in operating techniques, the daily output has reached a maximum of one hundred and sixty-five pieces.

    两个月完成六个多月的工作量
    张玉金小组跑在时间前头
    本报讯　大连造船厂张玉金锻工小组在今年1、2两月的四十八个实际工作日里，完成了六个月又二十天的工作量。
    这个去年曾经完成一年又八个多月工作量而被评为红旗单位的小组，最近总结了去年大跃进的经验，决定乘胜前进，今年要完成三十二个月的工作量。他们的成就和力争更大跃进的雄心，已经成为旅大市许多职工学习的榜样。
    这个小组今年一开始就在生产上创造了优异的成绩，首要因素是最大限度地提高了汽锤的利用率。他们在检查去年工作的时候，除了肯定经验以外，认为主要缺点是工具准备不好。如火红的毛坯从炉里夹出来放在钻子上，却常常因为找不到工具，使毛坯变成灰黑色，不得不重烧，耽误很多时间。今年一开头，他们就决心消除这种现象。有一天，车间分配下来二十多种活。活的样数多，用的工具也多。全组了解了这个情况，头天晚上大家就分工把工具、胎具准备好，第二天一上班，工具摆得整整齐齐，随心应手，工作起来，一环扣一环。这样就大大减少了汽锤的间歇时间，过去要十六小时甚至二十四小时干完的活，现在八小时就可以完成。
    张玉金小组根据生产需要，千方百计地改进工具。去年他们共革新了九十五种，今年又已提出了二十一项革新建议。由于不断注意革新技术，大大提高了生产效率。他们去年锻造船上用的链子板，经过了无数次的改进工具和操作方法，曾使效率提高到日产一百一十五个；今年2月由于他们进一步改进了操作技术，日产量已最高达到一百六十五个。
