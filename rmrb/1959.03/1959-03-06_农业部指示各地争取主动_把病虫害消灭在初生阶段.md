Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 3rd, requiring all regions to launch a campaign to eliminate overwintering and early spring pests and diseases, eradicating them during the overwintering and initial outbreak phases.

The notice pointed out that temperatures this past winter and spring have generally been higher than in previous years, resulting in a lower mortality rate for overwintering pests and diseases. In addition, some regions have not thoroughly controlled overwintering pests and diseases, leaving a substantial number of surviving pests. Of even greater concern: the Yangtze River basin has experienced heavy rainfall this spring, and the Yellow River basin has recently received widespread snowfall. While these conditions are conducive to the growth of early spring crops, they also favor the spread of wheat rust and scab, as well as the emergence and hatching of certain pests. Furthermore, this year's conditions of abundant water, sufficient fertilizer, and dense planting create a favorable breeding environment for pests and diseases. Based on these circumstances, the notice indicates that severe outbreaks of pests and diseases are highly probable this year. Therefore, all regions must seize the final opportunity before overwintering pests become active, combining this effort with current central tasks to launch a broad, deep, and thorough campaign to eliminate overwintering and early spring pests and diseases, resolutely eradicating them during the overwintering and initial outbreak phases.

The notice calls for the following work to be carried out effectively:

    I. In rice, coarse grain, cotton, fruit tree, and vegetable producing areas, efforts should be made to process the remaining stubble, stalks, withered branches, fallen leaves, and dry bolls before the Qingming Festival. Weeds along field edges and ditches should be cleared. Collected stubble, weeds, etc., should be promptly used for composting fertilizer or as fuel. Those reserved for feed should be crushed or sealed in mud.

    II. In cotton-growing areas, before the Grain Rain period, all flower storage and processing facilities should be thoroughly cleaned, and cracks in the walls should be sealed with mud. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that last year a significant amount of seed cotton was scattered in commune members' homes, benefiting overwintering pink bollworms. The communes must uniformly investigate and address this situation. Pests such as cotton aphids, spider mites, and blind plant bugs should be eliminated on their overwintering and early spring hosts by spraying pesticides.

    III. Conscientiously treat spring-sown seeds. In the case of early sowing, seedling diseases may be severe, and seed dressing agents may be insufficient. Therefore, all effective methods should be adopted for treatment.

    IV. Winter wheat producing areas should closely monitor the occurrence of rust and scab diseases in conjunction with field management. In areas where stripe rust occurs, conduct a comprehensive survey during the wheat regreening stage, treating while surveying, and eliminating it in the initial outbreak stage. In areas where leaf rust and stem rust occur, promptly grasp the disease situation after wheat regreening. When the rate of diseased leaves and stems reaches 1%, immediately spray pesticides for prevention and control to prevent its spread. The Yangtze River basin should pay attention to the prevention and control of wheat scab.

    V. Immediately seize the time to inspect, repair, and replenish existing sprayers and dusters.

    农业部指示各地争取主动
    把病虫害消灭在初生阶段
    新华社5日讯　农业部3日发出通知，要求各地开展一个消灭越冬和早春病虫害的战役，把病虫害消灭在越冬和初发生阶段。
    通知指出，去冬今春气温一般比往年高，所以越冬病虫死亡率低，加上部分地区对越冬病虫防治不彻底，目前存活的病虫数量仍然很大。更值得注意的是：长江流域今春降雨多，黄河流域最近又普遍下雪，虽有助于早春作物生长，但也对小麦锈病、赤霉病的流行，对某些害虫的羽化和出生有利。同时，在今年水大、肥足、密植情况下，作物生长密茂，又给病虫以良好的繁殖条件。根据这些情况，通知指出：今年的病虫很可能大发生，为此，要求各地必须抓住越冬病虫尚未活动的最后时机，结合当前中心工作，开展一个广泛、深入、彻底消灭越冬和早春病虫的战役，狠狠地把病虫消灭在越冬及初发生阶段。
    通知要求做好以下工作：
    一、在水稻、杂粮、棉花、果树、蔬菜等产区，争取清明节以前，把残余的根茬、秸秆、枯枝、落叶、枯铃进行处理，并把田边、沟边的杂草铲光。已经收集起来的根茬、杂草等，应及时沤熏肥料或作燃料。留作饲料的磨碎，或泥封。
    二、棉区在谷雨以前，对所有贮花、加工的房屋进行一次彻底清扫，并泥封墙上的缝隙。特别要注意去年有不少的籽棉分散在社员家里，便宜了红铃虫的过冬，必须由公社统一摸清情况，加以处理。对棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象等害虫，应在越冬、早春寄主上喷药消灭。
    三、认真处理春播的种子。在早播的情况下，苗期病害可能严重，拌种药剂又不足。因此，应采取一切行之有效的办法进行处理。
    四、冬小麦产区要结合田间管理工作，严密注意锈病、赤霉病的发生。条锈病发生地区，在小麦返青阶段，开展普查、边查边治，消灭在初发生阶段。叶锈、秆锈病发生地区，在小麦返青后及时掌握病情，当病叶、病秆率达1％时，立即喷药防治，不使蔓延。长江流域应注意小麦赤霉病的防治。
    五、对旧存的喷雾器和喷粉器立即抓紧进行检查，修理和补充。
