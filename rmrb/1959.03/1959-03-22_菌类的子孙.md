The general herbs and trees all blossom and bear fruit, propagating their offspring by seeds. Fungi give birth to fruiting bodies equivalent to flowers. Fruiting bodies bear spores equivalent to seeds. Spores are very small and can only be seen with a high-powered microscope. Spores are generally 0.004 to 0.007 cm long and 0.003 to 0.004 cm wide, only appearing as large as sesame seeds when magnified 800 times. One fungus contains tens of thousands of spores. For example, one Western pine mushroom produces 1.8 billion spores, and a certain type of ephemeral mushroom produces 5.24 billion spores. Each spore is 0.012 cm long. If these spores were arranged one by one, the total length would reach 41 miles.

    菌类的子孙
    一般草木都开花结实，借种子繁殖后代。菌类则生有与花相等的子实体。子实体上生有与种子相当的孢子。孢子很小，需用高倍显微镜才能看出来。孢子一般长为千分之四至千分之七厘米，宽千分之三至千分之四厘米，放大八百倍才有胡麻粒大。一个菌里有数以万计的孢子，如一个西洋松菌生十八亿个，一种一夜菌生有五十二亿四千万个。每个孢子长千分之十二厘米，若把这些孢子一个个排列起来，全长可达四十一哩。
