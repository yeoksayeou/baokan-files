　　Operating" on the Heart of the Machine Tool

　　Shanghai Machine Tool Factory Worker Wu Delun

　　I am a mechanical worker. Before liberation, I was called a "scrap metal worker." But under the leadership of the Party, an ordinary worker like me can actually change the design of a precision and complex control box. This was something I wouldn't even have dared to dream of in the past.

　　I started working on hydraulic components in 1953. At that time, the machine tools manufactured by our factory were just transitioning from gear transmission to hydraulic transmission. Precision and complex hydraulic transmission is a new technology in the machine tool industry, and the control box is an important component of hydraulic transmission. We compare it to the "heart" of the machine tool. This control box is very heavy, with forty-five high-precision parts. The inside of the box has countless throttle valves, using the principle of hydraulic transmission to control the automatic cycling of the machine tool, directing the starting, stopping, speed, and direction of the machine tool. At the beginning of manufacturing, the parts were complex, and there were many rejects. By 1954, we could only produce a maximum of twenty or so units per month, which seriously affected production. At that time, we workers felt very uncomfortable, and we discussed in private, saying, "How great would it be if we could improve it!" But then we thought: if it could be improved, the designers and experts would have already done it.

　　After the Great Leap Forward began last year, the demand for control boxes produced by our workshop became increasingly large. Even cars from other places came and parked at the factory gate, waiting to pick up the assembled control boxes. However, because the control box was limited by its complex design, the increase in output was very slow, whether it was in processing or assembly. At this time, the Party Secretary called on us workers at the factory-wide meeting to break superstitions, liberate our minds, and be bold in creation. These words gave me great encouragement. I had been constantly thinking about reforming the control box for the past few years, but I was afraid of failure and didn't dare to bring it up. After the meeting, I thought, "If I don't bring it up now, when will I?" So I went back to the dormitory and started drawing; I only rested when I was really tired. Sheet after sheet of drawings, either couldn't be pieced together here or had problems there. Seeing that they wouldn't work, I tore them all up. After a week of this, I had conceived dozens of specific drawings, and finally, I had one left. Seeing that it was relatively reasonable, I drew it in a notebook.

　　The next day, I gave this oil-stained drawing to engineer Zhu Danian. After the Party branch learned about this, they supported me with all their strength and appointed engineer Zhu Danian and technician Chen Songkai to draw detailed drawings based on the sketch. Thanks to the care of the Party and the support of the collective, the drawing was completed in just three days, and many experienced masters from the assembly team collectively studied it and offered suggestions.

　　When I participated in processing the first new-style control box, I was very excited, carefully chiseling each oil hole. After only a week, the first control box was assembled successfully and was about to enter the test run. Looking at all this, I was both happy and worried. The leaders and comrades were so concerned, what if it didn't succeed? But then I thought, if it doesn't succeed, try again. With the Party and the comrades, we will definitely succeed. The machine started, and at the beginning, there were some problems. There was an impact when running at high speed, and the speed couldn't be reached when running at low speed. Oil leakage was also discovered. At that time, many workers were gathered around the test bench. Many people, many ideas. After summarizing, they immediately drilled and grinded. The second test run was finally successful. After a while, gongs and drums sounded, and the comrades excitedly came to congratulate us on the successful improvement of the control box. In order to celebrate the great victory of the Party in leading the technical revolution, everyone named it "GY22"; "G" represents technical revolution. After the improvement, the parts of the control box were streamlined from the original seventeen to ten, and the weight was reduced from fifteen kilograms to ten and a half kilograms.

　　This control box played the role of a catalyst. Only a week later, young assembly worker Xin Fuyu put forward an improvement suggestion based on this control box, combining the control valve and the reversing valve, and successfully trial-produced the "GY23" control box, which is small and exquisite, with only seven parts, while still maintaining the practical performance of the control box. It's just that because the "GY23" has a small oil content, it is only suitable for several special grinding machines. In the near future, an even better control box will surely appear.

　　This year is the decisive year of three years of hard work. In order to better complete the national production tasks, we are continuing to make great strides in the technical revolution. Now, our workshop has established a theoretical study group, and technicians are giving us lessons in conjunction with actual production activities. Although our tasks are busy, we are determined to continuously improve our technical theory and, under the cultivation of the Party, become a new type of worker who is capable in both literature and military affairs, and better strive for the cause of socialist construction.

    向机床的心脏“开刀”
    上海机床厂工人　吴德伦
    我是一个机械工人，解放前被人叫做“烂铜匠”。可是在党的领导下，像我这样一个普通工人竟然能够改变精密、复杂的操纵箱设计。这种事在过去是连做梦都不敢想的。
    我开始搞液压部件是在1953年。那时我们厂制造的机床刚从由齿轮传动转向液压传动。精密、复杂的液压传动是机床工业中一项新技术，而操纵箱又是液压传动中的一个重要部件，我们把它比喻为机床中的“心脏”。这个操纵箱很重，它有四十五个精度很高的零件，箱子内层有着无数个油门，运用液压传动的原理，用它来控制机床的自动巡回，指挥机床的开停，快慢及转向。刚开始制造时，零件复杂，报废很多，到1954年，每月也最多只能生产二十多只，曾经严重地影响了生产。那时我们工人心里都很难受，背后议论着说：“要能改进一下该是多么好啊！”可是又想：要是能改进，设计师、专家早就改了。
    去年全国大跃进开始以后，我们车间生产的操纵箱需要量越来越大，甚至外地也开来了汽车，停在厂门口等取装配好的操纵箱。可是操纵箱因为受到设计复杂的限制，加工也好，装配也好，产量上升得都很慢。这时，党委书记在全厂大会上号召我们工人破除迷信，解放思想，大胆创造。这些话给了我很大鼓励。这几年我曾不断琢磨过改革操纵箱的事，可是怕不成功，一直没敢拿出来。大会以后，我想：“现在不拿出去，还等什么时候？”于是回到宿舍，就提笔画起来；实在疲倦了，才歇了一会。一张张图纸，不是这里拼不拢，就是那里有毛病，看看不行，都撕掉了。这样有一星期功夫，先后设想了几十种具体的图样，最后剩下一种，看看比较合理了，就画在练习簿上。
    第二天，我把这份沾着油迹的图纸交给工程师祝大年。党支部知道这件事以后，就用最大力量支持我，并指定工程师祝大年和技术员陈松楷，根据草图画出详细图样。由于党的关怀和集体的支持，这份图纸只用三天功夫就好了，装配小组的很多老师傅还集体研究提出意见。
    当我参加加工第一只新式操纵箱的时候，内心非常激动，仔细地开凿着每个油眼。先后只一个星期，第一只操纵箱就装配成功，即将进入试车了。望着这一切，我心里一面高兴，一面担忧。领导和同志们都这样关心，要是不成功怎么办？但是又想，不成功，再试，有党、有同志们，一定能成功。机器开动了，开始的时候有点毛病，开快车有冲击，开慢车速度达不到，又发现漏油。当时，许多工人都围在试验台旁，人多主意多，归纳之后，立即钻的钻、磨的磨，第二次试车终于成功了。不一会，锣鼓声响起来了，同志们为改进操纵箱的成功兴高采烈地赶来庆贺。大家为了庆贺党领导技术革命的伟大胜利，给它定名“GY22”；“G”，代表着技术革命。改进后的操纵箱，零件从原来的十七个精简到十个，重量由十五公斤减轻到十点五公斤。
    这个操纵箱起了抛砖引玉的作用。仅仅隔了一个星期，青年装配工人忻福裕，就在这种操纵箱的基础上又提出了改进建议，把操纵阀和换向阀合并，试制成功“GY23”操纵箱，小巧玲珑，只有七个零件，依然保持操纵箱实用的各种性能。只是因为“GY23”含油量少，所以还只是适用于几种专用磨床。在不久以后，一定会出现更好的操纵箱。
    今年是苦战三年具有决定性的一年，为了更好地完成国家生产任务，我们正在继续大闹技术革命。现在，我们车间已经成立了理论学习小组，由技术人员结合实际生产活动给我们上课。我们任务虽然繁忙，但是下定决心要不断地提高技术理论，在党的培养下成为一个能文能武的新型工人，更好地为社会主义建设事业努力。
