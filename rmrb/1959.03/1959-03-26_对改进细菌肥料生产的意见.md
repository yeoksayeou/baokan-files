    Opinions on Improving the Production of Bacterial Fertilizers
    Regarding the current production of bacterial fertilizers in various regions, we offer some suggestions for improvement for your reference.
    I. Quality and Price of Finished Products:
    The effect of bacterial fertilizers produced in various regions on agricultural production should be affirmed. However, the current production of bacterial fertilizers lacks appropriate specifications and standards. At the same time, there are no specific regulations on counting methods and operations, resulting in large discrepancies in the figures. Some production units indicate that the finished product contains several hundred million bacteria per gram, but inspections prove that it only contains several million live bacteria per gram.
    The function of bacterial fertilizer mainly relies on the beneficial microorganisms within it to reproduce and be active in the soil, improving soil fertility to benefit the absorption of nutrients by the root system. Its dosage should be appropriately increased, and the number of applications should be increased. In terms of production and manufacturing, it is advisable to produce and apply locally, which can greatly reduce production and transportation costs, and lower the price of finished products.
    II. Strain Issues:
    The quality and purity of the strain are related to the quality of the finished bacterial fertilizer product. In the past, a few qualified research institutions supplied production units, and these strains generally underwent purification, selection, comparative testing, and other steps. Later, as work progressed, some production units sold transplanted and cultured strains as commodities at high prices, and the strains suffered pollution and deterioration after repeated transplantation. We suggest that local agricultural science research units should be responsible for supplying excellent strains.
    III. Gibberellin Issues:
    This new type of plant growth and development stimulant has been successfully researched and produced in many regions of the country. According to newspaper advertisements, the finished products are mostly sold in liquid form, and the price is generally high. In fact, the cost of producing gibberellin is not high, and the effective components in the fermentation broth are easily decomposed and inactivated.
    This finished product is extracted and refined from the bacteria on diseased rice seedlings. If it is widely produced, it must be strictly controlled to avoid the spread of bacteria and cause serious consequences.
    Some types of antibiotic fermentation broth sold have a very short storage validity period, making them unsuitable for long-distance transportation as commodities. It is best to produce and use them locally.
    We believe that the quality inspection of commercial bacterial fertilizers and other biological products, the supply of strains, etc., should be the responsibility of local agricultural science research institutions, agricultural colleges, or qualified institutions to inspect, supply, and control. The selling price is also best to be jointly negotiated, so that bacterial fertilizers can better serve agricultural production.

### 对改进细菌肥料生产的意见

    对改进细菌肥料生产的意见
    我们就目前各地的细菌肥料的生产情况，提出一些改进的意见，供大家参考。
    一、成品的质量和价格问题：
    各地生产的菌肥，在农业生产上的效果是应该肯定的。不过，目前菌肥生产还缺乏适当的规格标准，同时在计数方法和操作上还没有一定的规定，以致数字出入很大。有些生产单位标明成品含菌每克有若干亿，但检查证明，每克只含几百万个活菌。
    菌肥的作用，主要是依靠其中有益的微生物在土壤中繁殖活动，提高土壤肥力，以利于根系吸收养分。它的用量应适当增大，施用次数应增多。在生产制造方面，宜于就地生产，就地施用，这样可以大大地降低生产和运输成本，降低成品价格。
    二、菌种问题：
    菌种的优劣和纯度，关系着菌肥成品的质量。过去由少数有条件的研究机关供应生产单位，这些菌种一般都经过纯化、提选、比较试验等等步骤。以后因工作开展，有的生产单位把菌种移植培养作为商品出售，售价很高，并且菌种经过辗转移植，带有污染变质的情况。我们建议，最好由各地农业科学研究单位负责供应优良菌种。
    三、赤霉素问题：
    这种新型的植物生长发育刺激素，已在国内很多地区研究成功并进行生产。据报刊广告，成品大都是以液体状态出售，售价一般较高。其实生产赤霉素成本并不高，而且在发酵液状态，其中的有效成分很容易分解失效。
    这种成品是从水稻恶苗病株上的病菌中，分离提炼出来的。如果广泛生产，必须严格控制，以免病菌传播，造成严重后果。
    出售的抗菌素发酵液，有某些种类贮藏有效期很短，作为商品远程运售，不大适宜。最好是就地生产，就地使用。
    我们认为，商品菌肥等生物制品的质量检查，菌种供应等等，最好由当地的农业科学研究机构、农学院校或有条件的机构，负责检查、供应和掌握。售价也最好能共同协商。以便细菌肥料能更好地为农业生产服务。
