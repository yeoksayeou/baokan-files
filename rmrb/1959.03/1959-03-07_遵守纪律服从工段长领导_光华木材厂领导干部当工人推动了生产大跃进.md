Observing Discipline and Obeying Workshop Director Leadership
Guanghua Lumber Factory Leading Cadres Working as Workers Promoted the Great Leap Forward in Production

    (Our report) Beijing News -- Since the beginning of this year, leading cadres of the Beijing Guanghua Lumber Factory, including the Party Secretary and the Factory Director, have left their current positions and taken turns going to workshops and teams to work as workers, creating favorable conditions for the comprehensive completion of this year's Great Leap Forward plan.

    The Guanghua Lumber Factory has more than 160 cadres detached from production. At the beginning of this year, based on summarizing the experience of cadres participating in labor to promote production last year, the factory's Party committee formulated a plan for all cadres in the factory to go to workshops to work as workers this year.

    The participation of all leading cadres in labor as ordinary workers has been warmly welcomed by the workers and has greatly boosted the workers' enthusiasm for production. The relationship between cadres and workers has undergone a significant change. In the past, the third work section of the factory's door and window workshop often failed to complete its production plan. In early February, after Deputy Party Secretary Hou Chunxiang and other leading cadres went to this work section to work as workers, they took the lead in strictly observing labor discipline, obeying the leadership of the work section leader, and actively taking the lead in hard work, which inspired the workers' enthusiasm. Many workers said excitedly, "The Deputy Party Secretary is working with us, full of energy. We must step up our efforts to catch up." As a result, they completed the February production plan for this work section three days ahead of schedule.

    In the course of labor, the factory's leading cadres have better listened to the opinions and demands of the masses, and have promptly discovered and solved key problems in production. The production efficiency of the factory's third workshop's machine workers often could not keep up with the needs of the carpentry assembly, sometimes causing the carpenters to wait for work, which affected the completion of the door and window production plan. After the leading cadres of the Party committee and the administration worked as workers in this workshop, they found that the production efficiency of the sixth work section of this workshop was relatively high, so they promptly helped them summarize their experience, which further increased the machine processing efficiency by more than 30%. Subsequently, the workshop leaders promoted the experience of the sixth work section throughout the workshop, increasing the workshop's monthly output of doors and windows from 21,000 sets to 32,000 sets, creating the highest record in the ten years since the factory was established. The quality of the factory's plywood has been unstable for a long time. This time, in the process of labor, leading cadres such as Party Secretary Peng Dekun and Deputy Factory Director Deng Jinyu found that glue penetration and uneven pressing often occurred in the glue pressing process, affecting the quality of the plywood. They immediately worked with the workers to study and overcome this shortcoming, so that the first and second grade products of plywood were stabilized at around 80%.

    遵守纪律服从工段长领导
    光华木材厂领导干部当工人推动了生产大跃进
    本报讯　北京市光华木材厂从今年年初开始，党委书记、厂长等领导干部脱离现任职务，轮流下到车间、小组去当工人，给全面完成今年的跃进计划创造了良好的条件。
    光华木材厂有一百六十多名脱产干部。今年年初，工厂党委在总结去年干部参加劳动推动生产的经验的基础上，订出了今年全厂干部下车间当工人的规划。
    全厂领导干部以普通工人的身分参加劳动，受到了工人的热情欢迎，并且大大鼓舞了工人的生产积极性。干部和工人的关系起了显著的变化。这个厂门窗车间的三工段过去常完不成生产计划。2月上旬，党委副书记侯春祥等领导干部到这个工段当工人后，以身作则地严格遵守劳动纪律，服从工段长领导，积极带头苦干，鼓舞了工人的干劲，很多工人激动地说，“党委副书记和我们一块劳动，干劲冲天。我们一定要加油赶上去。”结果，提前三天完成了本工段的2月份生产计划。
    这个厂的领导干部在劳动中，更好地听取群众的意见和要求，及时发现和解决了生产中的关键问题。这个厂三车间机器工的生产效率常常赶不上木工装配的需要，有时造成木工窝工的现象，影响了门窗生产计划的完成。党委和行政的领导干部在这个车间当工人后，发现这个车间六工段机器工人的生产效率比较高，就及时帮助他们总结经验，使机器加工效率又提高了30％以上。接着，车间领导在全车间推广了六工段的经验，使车间的门窗月产量从二万一千樘提高到三万二千樘，创造了建厂十年来的最高纪录。这个厂的胶合板质量长期以来不大稳定。这次，党委书记彭德昆及副厂长邓金玉等领导干部在劳动过程中，发现胶压工序中经常发生透胶和压得不平，影响胶合板的质量。他们立即和工人一起研究，克服了这个缺点，使胶合板的一、二级品稳定在80％左右。
