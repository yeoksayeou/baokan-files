——Introducing "The Transformation of My Worldview"

Yanagida Kenjuro is a famous contemporary Japanese philosopher and social activist, and was once an important member of the Nishida philosophy school [Note], a school of modern bourgeois idealist philosophy. Now, he is stepping over Nishida philosophy and moving towards militant materialism.

"The Transformation of My Worldview" is a fascinating book. As I read it, it was as if an honest old scholar was sitting in front of me,娓娓动听地narrating his childhood, his arduous youth and middle age of seeking knowledge, and the suffering of the Japanese people after World War II, and his fierce ideological struggles. Through these introductions, he tells us how he turned from an idealist to a materialist. As a reader, I cannot agree with some of the arguments in his book; but more importantly, I am pleased to see his transformation and am willing to introduce this book to readers in our country.

From the perspective of the old world, Yanagida Kenjuro was "fortunate" to climb to the upper class of society. He was born into a middle-peasant family. When he graduated from elementary school, his father originally wanted him to "be the heir to a farmer," but in view of the child's "sincere pursuit of learning," he was sent to a normal school for "further study." In this way, Yanagida Kenjuro finished normal school and was assigned to a remote rural area as an elementary school teacher. This was in 1913. Later, after many years of hard self-study, he became a normal school teacher, went to Kyoto University, and eventually served as a professor at several universities. He also wrote books and became an important member of the Nishida philosophy school and a famous Japanese scholar. He considered himself a super-class, most just person. This kind of life purpose, as he now criticizes, "is of an extremely egoistic nature."

From "The Transformation of My Worldview," we can see that an idealist philosopher can indulge in the illusions of his own thinking, but the "secular" world cannot but shake his real life. "The urgency of the times" played a decisive role in Yanagida Kenjuro's ideological transformation. Yanagida Kenjuro lost his beloved only son in World War II, which pushed him into an abyss of grief from which he could hardly extricate himself; the economic oppression after World War II actually fell on people like university professors; what made him feel "infinite grief and extreme anger" was the loss of independence of the Japanese nation and its occupation by the United States. Finally, he saw the restoration of Japanese military industry, the revival of the old army, the establishment of American military bases everywhere, and he heard the footsteps of war. More importantly, he saw the strength of the Japanese working people, the prosperity of the socialist camp, and the rise of colonial national liberation movements. Therefore, he was determined to walk out of his study and into the streets to fight for peace and socialism. He said: "I am not necessarily a member of the proletariat now, I may belong to the petty bourgeoisie; however, the conscience of the modern era and the reason of the world are constantly demanding that I liquidate the inferior qualities of the petty bourgeoisie and shift to the proletariat to carry out activities as a necessity. In a sense, this will threaten my personal fate, and may even lead to persecution in the future; but no matter what, I cannot change my determination."

Yanagida Kenjuro is an idealist scholar. In addition to "the urgency of the times," the reason why he turned to materialism, as he himself said, was that "there must also be ideological preparation subjectively."

Yanagida Kenjuro's transformation of worldview occurred after World War II, but he came into contact with Marxism-Leninism relatively early. When he was studying philosophy at Kyoto University (1922-1925), he participated in the work of the Social Science Research Association. But at that time, he believed that "the Social Science Research Association is a research institution, and it is not necessary to participate in strikes, and it should honestly take academic research as its main task." Later, when he discovered that the members of this group were "practice-centered," he left. He also argued with Japanese Communist activist Iwata Yoshimichi on the issue of worldview, but he used Kant's idealist philosophy to oppose dialectical materialism. Given this, why did he later turn to Marxism? As mentioned above, the issue of national independence was placed before him, the torrent of democracy was pushing him forward, especially the struggle in the ideological field, which in turn pushed him into the torrent of striving for national independence and democracy.

As an idealist philosopher, it is impossible to turn to materialism without criticizing his own philosophical ideas. I believe that Yanagida Kenjuro's several face-to-face debates with materialists played an important role. In 1946, under the auspices of the Materialism Research Association of Tokyo University, he had a debate with the materialist philosopher Matsumura Kazuto on "Idealism or Materialism?"; later, in a radio discussion, he had a debate with Miyamoto Kenji, who was then the head of the Cultural Department of the Japanese Communist Party, and others on "Does God Exist?"; a year later, he again debated Christianity and materialism with the atomic physicist Watanabe Akira and Waseda University professor Matsuo Takashi in another radio discussion. If the first and second debates made him distressed and instead increased his demand for religion, then in the third debate, he realized that he was standing on the backward side of society, and therefore emphasized the historical mission of religion in the debate. That is, he believes that "standing on the side of the proletariat and contributing to the liberation of the abused people is the real mission of a religious person; without it, the so-called human love of religion has nothing but empty concepts." He said: "Starting from this discussion, it can be said that I have already taken the first step towards a new direction." The author also tells us that after he interacted with communists, he was introduced into "a world of noble morality that I had never known before." He realized: "It is these communists who are the conscience of the nation and the reason of the world. But people curse these pure people as demons and treat them as traitors to the country! What an unreasonable society this is!" At the same time, he also realized that as a philosopher who pursues truth, "no matter how profound the truth is, if it does not become the property of the masses, it will not complete its historical mission." So he decided to join the masses, willing to "become a member of them, and while taking their sorrows as my sorrows and their happiness as my happiness, I must also think together, decide together, and act together with them."

The chapter "Self-Criticism of Nishida Philosophy" in the book is the most valued by readers, not only because "Nishida philosophy and materialism have been enemies since a long time ago," but more importantly because Nishida philosophy's opposition to materialism is universal. The author tells us that Nishida's "key points of criticism" of materialism can be summarized as "consciousness is not produced from matter." This is indeed the most fundamental opposition between idealist and materialist philosophy. Related to this issue is the fact that Nishida philosophy ignorantly despises materialism's theory of reflection as an epistemology based on naive realism. Like all bourgeois philosophies, Nishida philosophy seemingly impartially covers up class and class struggle from the standpoint of "humanity in general," and therefore, in the doctrine of the state, it insists on saying that the tool of class rule is "the self-expression of human reason." On all these issues, Yanagida Kenjuro has carried out useful criticisms of Nishida philosophy to varying degrees, thus realizing that "Nishida philosophy, as a philosophy that does not stand on the proletariat's position of negating and transforming the existing society (i.e., neglecting and negating class practice), has at least become a philosophy suitable for the bourgeoisie's demands of perpetually affirming the status quo." Precisely because of this understanding, although Yanagida Kenjuro believes that his criticism of Nishida philosophy is "very uncomfortable from a personal friendship perspective," he said: "Perhaps someone will criticize me and say, 'You are a traitor.' I am willing to accept this."

As mentioned above, Yanagida Kenjuro has made useful self-criticisms on some fundamental philosophical issues, but his view that he wants to "resolve to combine Nishida philosophy with materialism to create a philosophy for the liberation of the Japanese proletariat" is untenable; because materialism and idealism are two fundamentally opposed worldviews, and the two can never be "combined." On the issue of religion, on the one hand, he admits that religion lacks a scientific understanding of social reality, but he also believes that he "cannot understand" the need to negate religion. He believes that "at the root of the universe, there is some great force beyond our consciousness at work," and we can only silently worship it. When talking about this issue, Yanagida Kenjuro himself also realized that "this is a remnant of past idealism and a remnant of mysticism," but he also said "I am not yet convinced by all these conclusions."

It should be stated that Yanagida Kenjuro was still a believer and promoter of Nishida philosophy until 1947-1948, and "The Transformation of My Worldview" was written in August 1951, nearly eight years ago. During this period, he traveled to our country and the Soviet Union in 1954, which made him even more convinced of the righteousness of the socialist cause. After returning to Japan, he wrote a book "My Journey to Seek Truth," telling the Japanese people the real situation of socialist countries. In order to counter the bourgeois propaganda agencies' frantic attacks on communism and the Soviet Union by borrowing the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots in 1956, he wrote another book "The Philosophy of Freedom" in 1957. This book critically examines the essence of freedom in modern capitalist society, scientifically demonstrates the objective criteria of freedom, and tells people what true freedom is and how to strive for it. This is a very valuable work, and it also shows the progress of his thinking. Recently, at the "Abolish the Security Treaty, Promote Peaceful Coexistence and Peace Conference" jointly organized by more than 30 Japanese groups, he gave a report as a permanent director of the Japan Peace Committee, calling on the Japanese people to step up their struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and promote peaceful coexistence. From this, it can be seen that Yanagida Kenjuro has practiced the glorious road he chose in the book "The Transformation of My Worldview" and is advancing bravely. How can we not be sincerely happy for him when we read this book? At the same time, from Yanagida Kenjuro's ideological transformation and its development, readers can see that this reflects the ideological changes of excellent intellectuals in modern Japan and other capitalist countries in many aspects, so this book has a certain significance of the times.

[Note] Nishida Kitaro (1870-1945) was a modern Japanese bourgeois philosopher. He combined Western bourgeois philosophy (mainly German idealist philosophy) with Eastern idealist philosophical thought, and used Western philosophical methods to form a unique philosophical system based on Mahayana Buddhism, namely the so-called "Nishida philosophy."

Nishida's representative work is "A Study of Good" (1911). The fundamental idea of this book is to take "pure experience" as the only reality. The so-called "pure experience" is the unity of subject and object, spirit and matter that have not yet been separated. This unity is neither subjective nor objective. Therefore, Nishida believes that his philosophy is a philosophy that transcends idealism and materialism. In fact, "pure experience" is nothing more than what he calls "consciousness phenomenon." In the final analysis, Nishida philosophy is actually a kind of subjective idealist philosophy, which reflects the ideology of Japanese capitalist society, which still had feudalist elements at that time. It is an academic bourgeois philosophy, and at the same time, in a sense, it is a philosophy of feudalism.

    抛弃唯心主义哲学前进
    ——介绍“我的世界观的转变”
    日本·柳田谦十郎著　李丙盛等译　三联书店出版
    王城
    柳田谦十郎是当代日本著名的哲学家和社会活动家，也曾经是现代资产阶级唯心主义哲学的一个流派——西田哲学派〔注〕的重要成员。现在，他正踏过西田哲学向战斗的唯物主义前进。
    “我的世界观的转变”是一本饶有趣味的书。我在看这本书的时候，仿佛在我的面前坐着一位诚实的老学者，娓娓动听地叙述着他的童年生活、他的艰苦求学的青年和壮年时期，以及第二次世界大战后日本人民的苦难、他的激烈的思想斗争。通过这些介绍，他告诉我们，他如何从一个唯心主义者转向唯物主义。作为一个读者，我不能同意他的书里的某些论点；但是更主要的是，我高兴地看到他的转变，并愿意把这本书介绍给我国的读者。
    从旧世界的眼光看来，柳田谦十郎是“有幸”爬到上层社会的人。他出身于中农家庭，在小学毕业的时候，他的父亲本来要他“当一个农民的继承子”，但是鉴于孩子“诚心向学”，以后还是送他到师范学校“深造”。就这样，柳田谦十郎念完师范，被派到一个偏僻的农村当小学教员了。这是1913年的事。以后他经过多年的刻苦自学，当师范教员，上京都大学，最后连任几个大学的教授，并且著书立说，成为西田哲学派的重要成员，也是日本著名的学者了。他自以为是一个超阶级的最公正的人。这种人生目的，正如他现在所批判的，“是带有极端利己主义性质的”。
    从“我的世界观的转变”一书中我们看到，一个唯心主义的哲学家可以沉溺于自己思维的幻境，但是“世俗”世界却不能不震撼他的现实生活。“时代的迫切逼人”，对柳田谦十郎的思想转变，起了决定性的作用。柳田谦十郎在第二次世界大战中失去了心爱的独生子，这把他推进悲痛的深渊几乎不能自拔；第二次世界大战后的经济上的压迫，居然临到大学教授一类人头上来；最使他感到“无限悲痛和万分愤怒”的是日本民族丧失独立，处于美国的占领下，最后，他看到日本军事工业恢复起来了，旧军队复活了，到处建立美国的军事基地，他听到了战争的脚步声。而且更重要的是他看到了日本劳动人民的力量、社会主义阵营的兴盛和殖民地民族解放运动的高涨。因此，他决心走出书斋，奔向街头，为和平与社会主义而奋斗。他说：“我现在还不一定是属于无产阶级的，我也许是属于小资产阶级的；但是，现代的良心和世界的理性却时刻在要求着我去清算小资产阶级的劣根性并转到无产阶级这一边来活动的必然性。在某种意义上就是说，这将会使我个人的命运遭受到威胁，甚至以后将会遭受到迫害；但是无论如何我也不能改变我的决心。”
    柳田谦十郎是一个唯心主义的学者，他之所以转向唯物主义，除了“时代的迫切逼人”以外，正如他自己说的，“在主观上也是要有思想准备的”。
    柳田谦十郎世界观的转变，是第二次世界大战以后的事，但是他接触马克思列宁主义却是比较早的。他在京都大学学习哲学时（1922—1925年），曾经参加过社会科学研究会的工作。但是当时他认为“社会科学研究会是一个研究机构，可以不必参加罢工，应当老老实实地以进行学术研究为主要工作”。后来当他发现这个团体的成员“是以实践为中心”时，他就离开了。他也曾与日本共产党活动家岩田义道争论世界观的问题，但是他是用康德的唯心主义哲学来反对辩证唯物主义。既然如此，他为什么后来转向马克思主义呢？如上所述，民族独立的课题摆在他的面前，民主的激流在推动他前进，特别是思想领域里的斗争，反转过来把他推向争取民族独立与民主的洪流里去。
    作为一个唯心主义的哲学家，如果不通过对自己的哲学思想的批判，是不可能转向唯物主义的。我认为柳田谦十郎与唯物主义者几次面对面的论战，是有重要作用的。1946年，在东大唯物主义研究会的主持下，他与唯物主义哲学家松村一人进行过“唯心主义还是唯物主义？”的辩论；以后在广播讨论会上，他又与当时任日本共产党文化部长的宫本显治等人进行了“神是否存在？”的辩论；过了一年，他再一次在一次广播讨论会上与原子物理学者渡边慧和早稻田大学教授松尾隆辩论了基督教和唯物主义的问题。如果说第一、二次辩论，使他苦恼，反而对于宗教的要求高涨起来，那末在第三次辩论时，他已觉悟到自己是站在社会的落后方面，因而在辩论时强调了宗教的历史使命。即认为“站在无产阶级这一边，为被虐待的人们的解放而贡献自己才算是一个宗教者的现实的使命；缺了它，所谓宗教的人类爱除空虚的观念以外没有其他任何东西”。他说：“以这个讨论会为起点，可以说我已经开始向新的方向迈进了第一步”。作者又告诉我们，他以后与共产主义者一经交往，就被引进了“一个过去一直完全不知道的高尚道德的世界”。他才认识到：“正是他们这些共产主义者才是民族的良心、世界的理性。但是人们却咒骂这些纯洁的人们是魔鬼，对待他们和对待国家的叛徒一样！这是一个多么不合理的社会！”同时，他也认识到，作为一个追求真理的哲学家，“真理不管它怎样高深，如果它不成为群众的财产，也就不会完成自己的历史使命”。于是他决心参加到群众中去，愿意“成为其中的一分子，在以他们的悲苦为悲苦、以他们的快乐为快乐的同时，我还必须和他们共同思索、共同决议、共同行动”。
    书中“西田哲学的自我批判”是读者最为重视的一章，这不仅是因为“西田哲学和唯物主义从老早就是冤家”，而更重要的是因为西田哲学反对唯物主义的观点是有普遍性的。作者告诉我们，西田对唯物主义的“批判的要点”，可以归结为“意识不是产生自物质的”。这的确是唯心主义与唯物主义哲学最根本对立之所在。与这个问题相联系的是西田哲学把唯物主义的反映论当作是站在朴素的实在论上的一种认识论加以无知的轻视。西田哲学也像所有资产阶级哲学一样，貌似公正地以“人类一般”的立场，掩盖阶级和阶级斗争，因而在国家的学说上，把阶级统治的工具硬说是“人类理性的自我表现”。对所有这些问题，柳田谦十郎都在不同程度上对西田哲学进行了有益的批判，从而认识到“西田哲学，作为不是站在要去否定和改造现存社会的无产阶级立场上的哲学（即忽视和否定阶级实践的哲学），至少它是成了适合于妄想永久肯定现状的资产阶级要求的哲学”。正因为有了这样的认识，柳田谦十郎虽然认为他批判西田哲学，“从私人情谊来说，那是非常难受的”，但是他表示：“也许会有人非难我说，你是一个叛徒。这话我也甘心接受。”
    如上所述，柳田谦十郎在哲学的一些带根本性质的问题上做了有益的自我批判，但是他要“决意使西田哲学同唯物主义结合起来，创造一种日本无产阶级解放的哲学”的观点，是不能成立的；因为唯物主义与唯心主义是两种根本对立的世界观，二者是绝不可能“结合起来”的。在对待宗教问题上，他一方面承认宗教是对社会现实缺乏科学的认识，但是他又认为要否定宗教，“那我是想不通的”。他以为“在宇宙的根底处有着超越我们意识的某种伟大的力在活动着”，对它唯有默默加以崇拜。在谈到这个问题的时候，柳田谦十郎自己也意识到“这是过去唯心主义的残余，神秘主义的遗毒”，但是他又表示
  “所有这些结论现在还不能使我信服”。
    应该说明，柳田谦十郎直到1947—1948年，仍然是西田哲学的信徒和宣传者，而“我的世界观的转变”一书，是1951年8月写的，距今将近八年了。在这期间，他曾于1954年到我国和苏联旅行，这使他更加相信社会主义事业的正义性。他回日本后写了一本“我寻找真理的旅行”，把社会主义国家的真实情况告诉了日本人民。为了回击资产阶级宣传机构借1956年匈牙利反革命暴乱对共产主义和苏联进行的疯狂攻击，他在1957年又写了一本“自由的哲学”。这本书批判地考察了现代资本主义社会中自由的实质，科学地论证了自由的客观标准，告诉人们什么是真正的自由，以及如何争取这种自由。这是一本很有价值的著作，也表现了他的思想的进程。最近他在由日本三十多个团体联合组织的“废除安全条约、促进和平共处和平大会”上，以日本和平委员会常任理事的身份作了报告，号召日本人民加紧斗争，废除日美“安全条约”和促进和平共处。由此可见，柳田谦十郎实践了他在“我的世界观的转变”一书中所选择的光荣道路奋勇前进，我们在读这本书的时候，怎能不衷心地为他高兴呢？同时，从柳田谦十郎的思想转变及其发展中，读者可以看到，这在许多方面都反映了现代日本以及其他资本主义国家的优秀的知识分子的思想变化，因而这本书是有一定的时代意义的。
    〔注〕西田几多郎（1870—1945年）是现代日本资产阶级哲学家。他把西方资产阶级哲学（主要是德国唯心主义哲学）与东方唯心主义哲学思想结合起来，用西方哲学的方法，以大乘佛教为基调，形成一个独特的哲学体系，即所谓“西田哲学”。
    西田的代表著作是“善的研究”（1911年）。该书的根本思想是以“纯粹经验”为唯一的实在。所谓“纯粹经验”就是主观与客观、精神与物质尚未分立的统一体。这个统一体，既非主观，也非客观。所以西田认为他的哲学是超乎唯心主义与唯物主义之上的一种哲学。其实，“纯粹经验”无非是他说的“意识现象”，归根到底，西田哲学实际上是一种主观唯心主义哲学，它反映了当时还带有封建主义因素的日本资本主义社会的思想，是学院式的资产阶级哲学，同时在某种意义上，它又是封建主义的哲学。
