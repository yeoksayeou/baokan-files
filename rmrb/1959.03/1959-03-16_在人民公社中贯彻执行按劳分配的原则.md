Implementing the Principle of Distribution According to Labor in People's Communes

The Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party correctly points out: The transition from socialism to communism is a rather long and complex process of development, and throughout this entire process, the nature of society remains socialist. The socialist principle of distribution is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work."

In the work of rectifying and consolidating people's communes in various localities, solving the problem of distribution has been placed in an important position. Many provinces have proposed implementing a method of "fixed grades and flexible evaluation" in the wage system portion distributed to commune members. The people's commune distributes wages to each production team according to the originally assessed wage levels, and the production team evaluates work and records points for the labor of commune members, issuing wages according to the work points assessed for each commune member (including those not graded) each month. This method adopts the experience of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives regarding work evaluation and point recording and can better embody the principle of distribution according to labor, more pay for more work.

According to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the manner in which people distribute social products ultimately depends on the social mode of production and the system of ownership. The distribution method adopted in the people's commune, of course, depends on the development level of the people's commune's ownership system. For a considerable period, our country's people's communes are not communist in nature but socialist; for a certain period, they are also not of the nature of ownership by the whole people but of collective ownership. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to implement the socialist principle of distribution according to labor, more pay for more work, in the distribution of products within the people's commune.

Implementing the principle of distribution according to labor in the people's commune can create a social atmosphere of "labor is glorious," facilitate the statistics and supervision of production, rationally allocate labor, and establish a production responsibility system and economic accounting system. This is conducive to the development of production, the increase of social products, the building of socialism, and the preparation of conditions for a gradual transition to communism. Distribution according to labor means using labor as the measure for distributing social consumer products, which, compared with unearned income, is the greatest equality. Of course, implementing this distribution principle will still have differences in income. However, these differences are different from the differences between the exploiting and exploited classes, and also different from the wealth disparity caused by class differentiation within the peasantry before agricultural collectivization, but only differences in the income of teams and individual members due to differences in the quantity and quality of labor and the different production bases. Some of these differences will continue to exist forever in communist society (because people's needs cannot be uniform), and others will disappear in communist society, but today they must be recognized and should be recognized. Recognizing differences is precisely to prepare conditions for gradually eliminating those differences that can and should be eliminated in the future. The elimination of these differences can only be achieved through the economic development level of each production team tending towards balance, the powerful surge of the people's commune's economy, and the realization of national industrialization, commune industrialization, and rural mechanization and electrification. If we simply attempt to eliminate this difference by adopting a method of leveling distribution, we will commit the error of egalitarianism, which can only have a negative and destructive effect on social production and the people's commune movement.

Under the principle of running communes diligently and thriftily, the people's commune's correct distribution is an extremely complex issue. It involves the relationship between the individual, the collective, and the state. In the final analysis, this is the issue of the relationship between our Party and 500 million peasants. On the basis of increased production, both accumulation and consumption must increase. This is the basic principle of distribution. With the great leap forward in production, accumulation must increase, which is necessary; however, the increase in accumulation should not be too much or too rapid, and accumulation and consumption must maintain an appropriate ratio. The Party Central Committee stipulates that it is necessary to ensure that the income of 90% of the commune members increases compared to the previous year, and the income of the remaining commune members is no less than the previous year. This is a minimum limit. In the distribution of the consumption portion, the collective consumption portion and the individual consumption portion must also have a correct ratio, and the individual consumption portion should occupy the main position. The collective consumption portion should gradually increase, but this increase should also not be too much or too rapid. In the individual consumption portion, a system combining wages and supply is implemented. This system carries the bud of communist distribution according to need, and we should actively cherish and support the growth of this bud. However, the supply portion and the wage portion must also have a correct ratio. As the Sixth Plenary Session resolution says, for a considerable period, the wage portion will be the main one and should have a relatively rapid increase; wage grades should maintain an appropriate gap, but not be excessively disparate.

Some people doubt whether implementing "distribution according to labor, more pay for more work" in the distribution aspect contradicts "politics in command." This is, of course, a misunderstanding. What is politics? In our socialist society, this is first of all acknowledging and adhering to socialist principles, opposing both Right-leaning conservatism and Left-leaning adventurism, and correctly handling the contradictions within socialist society. Correctly implementing the principle of "distribution according to labor" is an important aspect of adhering to socialist principles and also an important aspect of correctly handling the contradictions within socialist society. Of course, implementing this distribution system cannot replace ideological and political work, nor can it make people realize the great ideal of socialist construction and the correct relationship between the current interests of the individual and the long-term interests of the collective. Therefore, while caring about the material interests of the masses, we must also pay attention to strengthening ideological and political work, strengthening socialist and communist education for the masses, in order to continuously improve the consciousness of the masses and continuously improve the initiative and creative spirit of the masses in labor. Politics and economics should be unified, and the principle of conducting political and ideological education for the masses should be unified with the principle of caring about the material interests of the masses. Only in this way can we facilitate the development of production, the improvement of people's consciousness, the consolidation of people's communes, and socialist construction and the transition from socialism to communism.

### 在人民公社中贯彻执行按劳分配的原则

    在人民公社中贯彻执行按劳分配的原则
    党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议正确地指出：由社会主义过渡到共产主义是一个相当长相当复杂的发展过程，在这个整个过程中，社会的性质仍然是社会主义的。社会主义的分配原则是“各尽所能，按劳分配”。
    各地在整顿和巩固人民公社的工作中，都把解决分配问题，放在一个重要的位置。许多省提出，在分给社员的工资制部分实行“死级活评”的办法，人民公社按原来评定的工资级别，把工资发给各生产队，生产队对社员的劳动实行评工记分，根据每个社员（包括未评级的）每月评定的工分发给工资。这个办法接受了过去高级农业生产合作社关于评工记分的经验，可以较好地体现按劳分配、多劳多得的原则。
    根据马克思列宁主义的原理，人们对于社会产品采取什么分配方式，归根结底，取决于社会生产方式，取决于所有制。在人民公社中采取什么分配方式，当然也就取决于人民公社的所有制的发展水平。在一个相当长的时期内，我国的人民公社还不是共产主义性质的，而是社会主义性质的；在一定时期内，它也还不是全民所有制性质的，而是集体所有制性质的。因此，在人民公社内部的产品分配方面，实行社会主义的按劳分配、多劳多得的原则是完全必要的。
    在人民公社中贯彻执行按劳分配的原则可以造成“劳动光荣”的社会风气，便利于统计和监督生产，合理地进行劳动分配，建立生产责任制和经济核算制。这是有利于生产的发展，有利于社会产品的增加，也有利于社会主义的建设和为逐步向共产主义过渡准备条件的。按劳分配，就是拿劳动作为分配社会消费产品的尺度，这同不劳而获来作比较，就是最大的平等。当然，实行这种分配原则，还会有收入多少的差别。但是这种差别，不同于剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的差别，也不同于农业合作化之前由于农民内部阶级分化而产生的贫富差别，而只是由于劳动的数量质量不同和生产基础的不同而产生的队与队之间和队员个人之间收入多一些和少一些的差别。这些差别，一部分在共产主义社会也还会永远存在（因为人的需要是不可能整齐划一的），另一部分在共产主义社会将归于消失，但是在今天都必须承认和应该承认。承认差别，正是为了准备条件，逐步消灭那些将来可以消灭、应该消灭的差别。这些差别的消灭，只有通过各生产队的经济发展水平趋于平衡，人民公社的经济的强大高涨，全国工业化、公社工业化和农村机械化、电气化的实现，才能够做到。如果简单化地企图采用拉平分配的方法来消灭这种差别，就要犯平均主义的错误，对社会生产和人民公社运动就只能起消极的破坏作用。
    人民公社在勤俭办社的原则下，正确地进行分配，是一个极其复杂的问题。它涉及个人、集体和国家三方面的关系，归根到底，这是我们党同五亿农民的关系问题。在生产增长的基础上，积累和消费都要增加，这是分配的基本原则。生产大跃进了，积累要增加，这是必需的；但是积累的增加不能过多过急，积累和消费，必须保持一个恰当的比例。党中央规定，要保证90％的社员收入比上年有所增加，其余社员的收入也不比上年减少，这就是一个最低的界限。在消费部分的分配中，集体消费部分和个人消费部分也要有正确的比例，而且个人消费部分应当占主要的地位。集体消费部分是要逐步增长的，但是这种增长同样也不可过多过急。在个人消费部分中，是实行工资制和供给制相结合的制度，这个制度带有按需分配的共产主义的萌芽，我们应该积极地爱护和支持这种萌芽的生长。但是，供给部分和工资部分也要有正确的比例。如六中全会决议所说，在相当长的时间内，工资部分将是主要的，并且要有较快的增长；工资等级应当保持适当的差距，但是不要过分悬殊。
    有的人怀疑，在分配方面实行“按劳分配，多劳多得”同“政治挂帅”是否有矛盾。这当然是一种误解。什么叫政治呢？在我国社会主义社会里，这首先就是承认并且坚持社会主义原则，既反对右倾保守主义，又反对左倾冒险主义，并且正确地处理社会主义社会内部的矛盾。正确地实现“按劳分配”的原则，是坚持社会主义原则的一个重要方面，也是正确地处理社会主义社会内部矛盾的一个重要方面。当然，实行这个分配制度，并不能代替思想政治工作，并不能使人民认识到社会主义建设的伟大理想，认识到个人的目前利益和集体的长远利益之间的正确关系。因此，在关心群众物质利益的同时，还必须注意加强思想政治工作，加强对人民群众进行社会主义和共产主义教育，以便不断地提高人民群众的觉悟水平，不断地提高人民群众在劳动中的主动精神和创造精神。政治同经济应当统一起来，对群众进行政治思想教育的原则同关心群众物质利益的原则应当统一起来。只有这样，才能有利于生产的发展，有利于人民觉悟的提高，有利于人民公社的巩固，有利于社会主义建设和从社会主义向共产主义的过渡。
