To the respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

    As the women of the capital commemorate their own festival, as we cheer the brilliant achievements of the motherland's socialist construction, we respectfully offer our most cordial and sublime salute to our great Party Central Committee and our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

    Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the brilliant general line of the Party's socialist construction, the political consciousness of the women of the capital has been significantly raised, their enthusiasm for labor production has soared to unprecedented heights, and the number of women participating in social labor has increased as never before, contributing tremendous strength to socialist construction. We deeply realize that our happiness and progress are all obtained under the leadership, care, and encouragement of the Party and Chairman Mao. Only by closely following the Party on the path of socialism and communism can we achieve the complete liberation of women.

    We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward will occur this year. On the occasion of commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day, we resolutely guarantee to the Party and Chairman Mao: we must follow the Party's instructions, work a hundred times harder in our various positions, continue to go all out, aim high, improve our awareness, learn our skills, and work together with the people of the city and the whole country to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national construction plan, to achieve the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and to do our best to run the people's communes well! Let us greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with the most outstanding achievements!

    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

                                              March 7, 1959
