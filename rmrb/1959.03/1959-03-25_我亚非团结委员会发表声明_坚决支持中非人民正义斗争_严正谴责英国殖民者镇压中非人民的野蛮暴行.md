Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: Statement by the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee on Supporting the Struggle of the People of Nyasaland and Central Africa for National Independence

    The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee resolutely supports the just struggle of the people of Nyasaland, the people of Central Africa, and the people of Africa in various regions for national independence and against colonial rule and racial oppression, and extends warm fraternal greetings to the heroic people of Nyasaland and the people of Africa.
    For a long time, British colonialists have carried out extremely cruel plunder and oppression against the people of Nyasaland and the people of Central Africa, and forced Nyasaland to merge into the "Central African Federation." Since 1951, the heroic people of Nyasaland have continuously launched struggles against British colonial rule. Now, large-scale struggles for independence have broken out in more than 30 regions throughout Nyasaland. Despite the colonial authorities' massive arrests of patriots in these regions, bloody suppression and massacres by military police, and indiscriminate strafing by aircraft, the people of Nyasaland have continued to fight bravely against the colonial military police. Now, the people of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, the Union of South Africa, and other regions have also been drawn into this widespread struggle. Together with the ongoing struggles in other parts of Africa, they have formed a new high tide of anti-colonialism throughout Africa, shaking the last colonial strongholds of British imperialism in Africa.
    The Chinese people are extremely indignant at the frantic suppression and massacres carried out by British colonialists in Nyasaland, Central Africa, and other African regions, and solemnly condemn the barbaric acts of British colonialism! We demand that the British colonial authorities immediately stop the suppression and massacres of the people of Nyasaland, the people of Central Africa, and other African people! Immediately release Dr. Banda, Chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress, and all patriotic fighters in Central Africa, East Africa, who have been arrested for fighting for independence. The African people must gain independence and freedom.
    The Chinese people naturally have deep sympathy for the people of Nyasaland, the people of Central Africa, and the people of all of Africa, and will always stand with the people of Nyasaland, the people of Central Africa, and the people of Africa, and fight to end colonialism and oppose imperialist aggression. We firmly believe that the people of Nyasaland, Central Africa, and Africa, as long as they strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, will surely achieve a complete victory in the struggle against colonialism and for independence and freedom. Imperialists and colonialists must get out of Africa! Victory will surely belong to the African people!

    新华社24日讯　中国亚非团结委员会关于支持尼亚萨兰和中非人民争取民族独立斗争的声明
    中国亚非团结委员会坚决支持尼亚萨兰人民、中非人民以及非洲各地人民争取民族独立和反对殖民统治和种族压迫的正义斗争，并向英勇奋斗的尼亚萨兰人民和非洲人民致以热烈的兄弟的敬意。
    长期以来，英殖民主义者对尼亚萨兰人民和中非人民进行了极端残酷的掠夺和压迫，并强迫尼亚萨兰并入“中非联邦”。从1951年起，英勇的尼亚萨兰人民就不断地展开了反对英殖民统治的斗争。现在，在尼亚萨兰全境三十多个地区又展开了大规模的争取独立的斗争。尽管殖民当局对这些地区的爱国人士大肆逮捕，出动军警进行血腥镇压和屠杀，调派飞机滥肆扫射，而尼亚萨兰人民还是前仆后继，不屈不挠地与殖民军警奋勇搏斗。现在南罗得西亚、北罗得西亚、怯尼亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀、南非联邦以及其他地区的人民，也都卷入了这一广泛的斗争。他们与非洲其他地区正在进行的斗争，形成了整个非洲反殖民主义的新高潮，动摇了英帝国主义在非洲的最后殖民阵地。
    中国人民对英国殖民者在尼亚萨兰、中非和其他非洲地区进行的疯狂镇压和屠杀感到无比愤慨，并严正谴责英国殖民主义者的野蛮行为！我们要求英国殖民当局立即停止对尼亚萨兰人民、中非人民和其他非洲人民的镇压和屠杀！立即释放尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达博士和中非、东非所有为争取独立而遭受逮捕的爱国战士。非洲人民必须获得独立和自由。
    中国人民对尼亚萨兰人民、中非人民和全非洲人民自然地怀着深厚的同情，并将永远与尼亚萨兰人民、中非人民和非洲人民站在一起，为结束殖民主义和反对帝国主义侵略而奋斗。我们深信，尼亚萨兰、中非和非洲人民，只要加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够在反对殖民主义、争取独立和自由的斗争中取得彻底胜利。帝国主义和殖民主义者必须滚出非洲！胜利一定属于非洲人民！
