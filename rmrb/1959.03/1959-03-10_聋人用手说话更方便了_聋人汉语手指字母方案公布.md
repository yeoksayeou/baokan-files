Xinhua News Agency, March 9th. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Education recently issued a joint notice requiring all regions to implement the "Chinese Sign Language Alphabet Scheme for the Deaf" on a trial basis.

This scheme is based on the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet (hanyu pinyin) and uses twenty-six handshapes of the right hand to represent the twenty-six Chinese phonetic letters. Deaf and mute people can use these handshapes to spell out standard Mandarin sign language according to the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet scheme, as a type of deaf and mute sign language. This scheme was formulated by the China Welfare Association for the Deaf and Mute in July 1958, which invited linguists, philologists, psychologists, deaf and mute education workers, and people who have researched deaf sign language to form a Deaf Sign Language Reform Committee. After the scheme was formulated, it was extensively consulted and revised repeatedly.

The notice requires all regions to first implement this scheme on a trial basis in schools for the deaf and mute, spare-time literacy schools for the deaf and mute, and literacy classes (groups) as a literacy aid and auxiliary means for pronunciation teaching. Deaf people in deaf welfare organizations or deaf production units can also try using finger alphabets to improve the expression of gestures. The notice also requires relevant departments in all regions to promptly collect and reflect the problems encountered during the trial implementation process, report them systematically to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the China Welfare Association for the Deaf and Mute, and make a comprehensive trial implementation summary within half a year, so as to further research and revise it to achieve further perfection.

    聋人用手说话更方便了
    聋人汉语手指字母方案公布
    新华社9日讯　内务部和教育部最近发出联合通知，要求各地试行“聋人汉语手指字母方案”。
    这个方案以汉语拼音方案为基础，用右手的二十六个指式分别表示二十六个汉语拼音字母。聋哑人可以运用这些指式，按照汉语拼音方案拼成普通话手语，作为聋哑人手语之一种。这个方案是由中国聋哑人福利会于1958年7月间邀请语言学家、文字学家、心理学家、聋哑教育工作者以及对聋人手语有研究的人士，组成聋人手语改革委员会制定的。方案制定后，曾经过多方面征求意见和反复修正。
    通知要求各地先在聋哑学校、聋哑业余补习学校、扫盲班（组）作为识字拐棍和发音教学的辅助手段试行这个方案。聋人福利组织或聋人生产单位的聋人，也可以试行使用手指字母来改善手势语的表达方法。通知还要求各地有关部门在试行过程中，应及时搜集和反映试行中遇到的问题，按系统报内务部、教育部、和中国聋哑人福利会，并于半年内做出全面试行总结，以便再加研究修正，求得进一步完善。
