In the national coal mine workers' Red Flag competition in mid-March, the Fushun Mining Bureau continued to lead in completing the state plan on a daily and ten-day basis. The average daily output of the bureau in mid-March exceeded the state plan by 81%. Kailuan, Xuzhou, and Xishan Mining Bureaus all achieved large-scale bumper harvests in this ten-day period. The daily output of eighty coal mining faces in Kailuan all reached the high-yield production target proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry, making each working face reach an average monthly output of 15,000 tons of raw coal. More than thirty coal mining faces in Xuzhou Mining Bureau had eighteen reaching the high-yield daily output targets. Twenty out of twenty-nine coal mining faces in Xishan Mining Bureau reached the high-yield daily output targets.

In this ten-day period, fourteen key coal washing plants across the country overfulfilled their coal washing plans.

    在3月中旬全国煤矿职工红旗竞赛中，抚顺矿务局在按日按旬完成国家计划方面继续领先，全局中旬的平均日产量超过了国家计划81％。开滦、徐州和西山矿务局，在这一旬里都获得了大面积丰产。开滦八十个采煤工作面的日产量，平均都达到了煤炭工业部提出的高额丰产指标的日产水平，使每个工作面达到平均月产原煤一万五千吨。徐州矿务局三十多个采煤工作面，有十八个达到了高额丰产的日产指标。西山矿务局二十九个采煤工作面，有二十个达到了高额丰产的日产指标。
    在这一旬里，全国有十四个重点洗选厂超额完成了洗煤计划。
