Xinhua News Agency, March 5th, Blantyre Dispatch: The bloody suppression carried out by British colonialists after declaring a "state of emergency" in Nyasaland has further stimulated the will of the Nyasaland Africans to resist colonial rule.

It is reported that since the morning of the 4th, the number of African attacks on colonialist farms and colonial police patrols has increased. Many roads have become impassable because Africans have felled trees, and some roads can only be used when colonial vehicles travel in convoys.

In Mlanje, southeastern Nyasaland, local African residents gathered on the 4th to protest the colonial authorities' arrest of a village chief. In Cholo, crowds demonstrated with sticks, and four people were arrested.

According to news on the 5th, on the highway in the central province of Nyasaland near Chefeop, a group of angry Africans armed with spears fought the police, and one person was killed. In the area near Nhaia in this province, British forest rangers were attacked by Africans hiding in the jungle.

Fully armed colonial soldiers and police are still dispatched throughout Nyasaland to carry out brutal suppression of Africans. On the 4th, in the two commercial cities of Blantyre and Limbe, the colonial authorities sent vehicles equipped with loudspeakers to patrol various districts, coercing Africans to return to work, but many still persisted in their strike.

According to new reports, at least thirty-two Africans were massacred by colonial troops and police on the 3rd alone. Since February 18, more than forty Nyasaland Africans have sacrificed their lives in their heroic struggle, and countless have been injured. So far, more than two hundred people have been arrested.

The Nyasaland Africans, who only have stones and sticks in their hands, persist unyieldingly in the face of British colonialists' machine guns, rifles, tear gas, and "vampire" airplanes. They are determined to secede from the "Central African Federation" and implement self-government and independence for Africans and Asians. Chilwa, the legal advisor of the Nyasaland African National Congress and an African lawyer, said in a speech protesting the atrocities of the British colonialists, "We want independence. On this point we cannot compromise—with or without an army." He also said, "In the eyes of the Africans in Nyasaland, the Federation means the rule of the white immigrants of Southern Rhodesia."

Mrs. Chibambo, former chairman of the Women's League under the leadership of the African National Congress, said: "They have banned the National Congress, but they cannot ban the spirit."

    尼亚萨兰人民坚持斗争
    新华社5日讯　布兰太尔消息：英国殖民者在尼亚萨兰宣布“紧急状态”后所进行的血腥镇压，更加激发了尼亚萨兰非洲人反抗殖民统治的斗争意志。
    有消息说，自从4日清晨以来，非洲人袭击殖民者的农场、袭击殖民警察巡逻队的次数增加了。许多道路已经由于非洲人掘倒了树木而无法通过，有的道路也只有在殖民者汽车成队行驶时才能使用。
    在尼亚萨兰东南部的姆耳詹杰，当地非洲居民在4日曾经聚集起来抗议殖民当局逮捕一个村长。在乔洛，群众持着棍棒示威，有四个人被捕。
    据5日消息，在尼亚萨兰中部省靠近切菲奥普的公路上，一群愤怒的非洲人手持矛枪，同警察展开了斗争，有一人被杀。在这个省靠近纳海亚的地带，英国守林人受到隐藏在丛林中的非洲人的袭击。
    全副武装的殖民军、警仍然在尼亚萨兰全境出动，对非洲人进行残酷镇压。4日，在布兰太尔和林贝两个商业城市，殖民当局派了装有扩音器的车子到各区巡行，胁迫非洲人回来工作，但是许多人仍然坚持罢工。
    根据新的消息，仅仅在3日这一天就至少有三十二名非洲人被殖民军警屠杀。自2月18日以来，尼亚萨兰非洲人在他们英勇的斗争中牺牲的已超过四十人，受伤的不计其数。到目前为止，已经有两百多人被逮捕了。
    手中只有石块和棍棒的尼亚萨兰非洲人在英国殖民者的机关枪、步枪、催泪弹以及“吸血鬼式”飞机的面前坚持不屈，他们决心脱离“中非联邦”，实行非亚人自治和独立。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的法律顾问、非洲籍律师契尔瓦在抗议英国殖民者暴行的一次谈话中说，“我们要独立。在这一点上我们不能妥协——不论有没有军队。”他还说，“在尼亚萨兰的非洲人看来，联邦就意味着南罗得西亚白色移民的统治。”
    在非洲人国民大会领导下的妇女联盟前主席奇班博夫人说：“他们取缔了国民大会，可是他们取缔不了精神。”
