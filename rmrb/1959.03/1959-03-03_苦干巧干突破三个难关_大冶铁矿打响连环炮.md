Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 2nd: Daye Iron Mine workers have overcome three difficulties in open-pit mining during the spring rainy season, fully completing the February stripping, mining, and ore supply plans, and have also laid the technical foundation for ensuring the completion of the first quarter's plan.

After overfulfilling the January plan, Daye Iron Mine workers proposed the slogan "Launch a barrage of production successes, strive for monthly achievements" and launched a production increase and economy drive centered on technical revolution. In mid-February, continuous rain and snow brought three major difficulties to open-pit mining: cable joint explosions, roadbed subsidence of electric train railways, and water entering blasting holes making it difficult to detonate. As a result, the daily amount of ore rock mined and excavated dropped from 18,000 cubic meters to 11,000 cubic meters. However, under the leadership of the Party, the workers vigorously carried out technical innovations around the current key production issues, quickly eliminating the above difficulties. The "Joint Tackling Core Group" formed by the power station and electric shovel work sections found that the cause of the cable joint explosions was that the cables were stretched too long, had too many joints, and rainwater infiltrated the joints. Worker Liu Changquan suggested organizing cable workers, electric shovel operators, welders, etc., to implement assembly line operations in moving mobile poles, extending the high-voltage lines along with the movement of the electric shovel, while shortening the cable length and reducing the number of joints. After this suggestion was implemented, the cable joints went from exploding more than 20 times per shift to not exploding for three consecutive rainy days. Under the slogan of "Work hard and ingeniously, everyone tackle the problem, don't come down the mountain without complete victory," technician Fu Jianli and veteran worker Li Yingren finally researched the formula and manufacturing method and made nitrate-based waterproof explosives on the 18th. This type of explosive can sink to the bottom of the water for eighteen hours without reducing its power, and its blasting efficiency is about 25% higher than the original explosive, with a cost that is two-thirds lower. After overcoming these "three difficulties," the mine's daily output quickly rose to more than 20,000 cubic meters.

    苦干巧干突破三个难关
    大冶铁矿打响连环炮
    据新华社武汉2日电　大冶铁矿职工连破春雨期间露天开矿的三个难关，全面完成2月份剥离、采矿和供矿计划，并且在技术上为保证完成第一季度的计划打下了基础。
    大冶铁矿的职工在超额完成1月份计划以后，便提出“打响连环炮，力争月月红”的口号，开展了以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。2月中旬雨雪连绵，给露天采矿带来了三大困难：电缆接头爆炸，电气火车铁路路基下沉，炮眼进水很难放炮。因此，每天的采掘矿岩量由一万八千立方公尺下降到一万一千立方公尺。但是，职工们在党的领导下围绕当前的生产关键问题大搞技术革命，迅速地排除了以上的困难。动力站和电铲工段组成的“联合攻关核心小组”查出，电缆接头爆炸的原因是电缆牵的太长、接头太多，雨水浸入接头。工人刘长全建议将电缆工、电铲、焊工等组织起来，在迁移活动电杆中实行流水作业，使高压线路随电铲移动的位置延长，而电缆长度缩短，接头减少。这项建议实现后，电缆接头即由一班爆炸二十多次变为连续三个雨天都未爆炸。他们在“苦干加巧干，个个来攻关，不获全胜不下山”的口号下，最后由技术员傅建礼和老工人李英仁研究出配药和制造方法，在18日制成硝?防雨炸药。这种炸药能沉入水底十八小时不减威力，其爆破效率还比原用炸药高25％左右，成本低三分之二。这“三关”闯过以后，全矿的日产量即迅速上升到两万多立方公尺。
