    What is Commercial Storage and Transportation Work

    The main links of commercial work are purchasing, sales, allocation, and storage. In the process of commodity purchase and sales, it is necessary to go through several storage and transportation links. The better the storage and transportation work is done in these links, the more it can accelerate commodity circulation and save costs. Therefore, warehousing and transportation work is an important link in commodity circulation.

    The warehousing work of commercial departments is to ensure market supply and to safely store and promptly supply national reserve materials. Its main tasks are: to ensure commodity safety and to facilitate purchase and supply. In specific work, it is to do a good job in commodity maintenance and warehouse security and fire protection. Through the graded and zoned management system, each link inside the warehouse can achieve clear responsibilities. In terms of commodity inbound and outbound operations, we must constantly improve labor organization and procedural systems, and strengthen cooperation with wholesale, retail, loading and unloading, and handling departments, in order to complete the storage tasks in commodity circulation.

    The transportation task of commercial departments is to rationally organize and complete commodity allocation through railway and transportation departments and people's communes according to the requirements of commodity circulation. Its main work is: to formulate commodity transportation plans according to the commodity circulation plan, and to organize and complete commodity allocation in the shortest time, traveling the shortest distance, and spending the least amount of money. Methods include: carrying out direct transportation; mixed transportation of light and heavy materials; and constantly studying loading technology, improving loading methods, and increasing technical loading capacity; assisting people's communes in organizing transportation professional teams, and doing a good job in short-distance transportation, etc. (Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce)
