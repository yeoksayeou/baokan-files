Visiting the Xin'an River Construction Site
By Our Correspondent Liu Fan

The Xin'an River in March is enchantingly beautiful.

In the morning, after the car climbed the last hillside, we arrived at Cangtan. If the Xin'an River Hydropower Station construction site is a battlefield where every second counts, then Cangtan is the outpost of this battlefield. Here, along a ten-plus li (Chinese mile) stretch, scaffolding is densely packed, and trucks and trains transporting materials speed back and forth. That over three-hundred-meter-long belt conveyor is like a giant from a fairy tale. It has a large belly, swallowing eight thousand cubic meters of sand and gravel materials in twenty-four hours.

Following the path of the belt conveyor, we climbed over layers of scaffolding and finally made our way to the "70 Pier." Looking down from above, the Jiang-blocking dam, known as the "main battlefield," with its twenty-four concrete dam sections, stood tall in the heart of the river like towering buildings. The Jiang-blocking dam is the heart of the hydropower station. More than fifty factories and nearly a hundred trades distributed across the construction site are working hard for it. The rapid rise of the Jiang-blocking dam is related to the early power generation of the hydropower station. Therefore, people must raise the dam to the "70 elevation" before the April flood arrives in order to realize the plan of water storage on "May Day" and power generation on National Day.

On the "70 Pier" and "40 Pier," three gantry cranes lifted the 5.2-meter diameter water diversion steel pipes and sent them into the tunnels pre-set in the dam body. Then, installation workers and welders immediately jumped into the tunnels to install and weld. Five concrete mixing systems are distributed on the right bank, left bank, upstream, and downstream of the Jiang-blocking dam. The concrete produced here is continuously transported to various dam sections through a spider web of belt conveyors, cranes, trucks, trolleys, and other aerial and ground transportation tools. On the more than one thousand square meter dam body, hundreds of leveling workers immediately spread and smooth the concrete and rubble. Following closely behind them, the vibration workers inserted missile-like vibrators into the concrete, "thump, thump, thump," kneading and compacting the concrete and rubble. Those active underwater divers in the heart of the river swam to this side for a while, and then swam to that side, inspecting the dam cofferdam and checking the dam foundation....

Everything for early power generation, this is the battle slogan of the heroes building the Xin'an River, and it is also their battle goal. As early as last year, after the first phase of cofferdam diversion, the vehicle and pedestrian trunk line on the right bank was cut off by the backwater after the cofferdam. A huge construction site, with its transportation lines cut off, what an urgent matter this was. At that time, the scaffolders working at high altitudes put forward the battle slogan: the 38 elevation grand runway on the right bank must be built in the shortest time. This task was arduous. More than thirty scaffolders from the scaffolding platoon on the construction site stepped forward. Under the leadership of Platoon Leader Wang Guifang, they climbed to high altitudes and fought hard for three days, finally gloriously completing the task. In order to accelerate the progress of the right bank project, the dam site headquarters required the divers to complete the closure and airtightness of the second phase of the cofferdam within three days. Three days, this was nine-tenths shorter than the time required for the closure and airtightness of the first phase of the cofferdam project. After receiving this arduous task, the divers immediately used wooden boards, sacks, and straw bundles to block the water. Because the attraction of the water was great, wooden pieces as thick as bowls were sucked away with a "thump" as soon as they were placed down. At this critical moment, veteran diver Yao Xingen suddenly thought of using sacks filled with sand and gravel to block the water. He took several divers to the construction site and worked hard through the night. As a result, the task was completed eight hours ahead of schedule.

The Xin'an River Hydropower Station is leaping forward at such an astonishing speed. The hydropower station was originally planned to generate electricity in 1961. After the Great Leap Forward across the country, the Party Committee of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station proposed striving for early power generation this year. The original cost of the hydropower station was 403.84 million yuan, but it has now been reduced to 250 million yuan. When calculating this account, the workers patted their chests and said: "We are not only racing against time, but also saving more money. Because the Party tells us to do more, faster, better, and more economically, we must remember this sentence of the Party and build Xin'an River into a hydropower station that is more, faster, better, and more economical."

    访新安江工地
    本报记者　刘凡
    3月的新安江，景色迷人。
    早晨，汽车爬过最后一个山坡，我们来到了仓滩。如果说新安江水电站工地是一个分秒必争的战场的话，那末，仓滩就是这个战场的前哨阵地。这里，在十多华里长的线路上，脚手架密密层层，运送材料的汽车、火车往来奔驰。那三百多公尺长的皮带输送机，就像神话里所介绍的巨人一样，它有很大的肚皮，在二十四小时内要吞下去八千公方的沙石料。
    顺着皮带输送机的道路，我们翻过了重重叠叠的脚手架，好容易才爬上了“七○栈桥”。登高俯视，那个被称为“主要战场”的拦江大坝，二十四个混凝土坝段，像一幢一幢高大的楼房矗立在江心。拦江大坝是水电站的心脏，分布在工地上的五十多个工厂、近百个工种都在紧张地为它忙碌着。拦江大坝的飞速升高，关系到水电站的提前发电，因此，人们必须在四月洪水来到之前将大坝升高到“七○高程”，这样才能实现“五一”蓄水、实现国庆发电的计划。
      “七○栈桥”和“四○栈桥”上的三台门式起重机吊着直径五·二公尺的输水钢管，送进坝身预为设置的坑道里去，接着安装工人、电焊工人便立即跳下坑道进行安装、焊接。拦江大坝右岸、左岸、上游、下游分布着五个混凝土拌和系统，从这里生产出来的混凝土，通过蛛网般的皮带输送机、起重机、汽车、斗车等各种空中、地面的运输工具，源源地输送到大坝的各个坝段。在一千多平方公尺的坝体上，几百个平仓工立即把混凝土和毛石散开、拉平。紧跟在他们后面的震动工，将炮弹似的震动器插进混凝土里，“通、通、通”地把混凝土和毛石揉和、压紧。那些活跃在江心的潜水工人，在蓝湛湛的江水里，一会儿游到这边，一会儿又游到那边，他们正在检查大坝围堰、察看大坝坝基……。
    一切为了提前发电，这是建设新安江的英雄们的战斗口号，也是他们的战斗目标。早在去年第一期围堰导流以后，由于右岸的车辆、人行干线被围堰以后的回水切断了。一个庞大的工地，交通线被截断了，这是一件多么紧急的事情。当时，高空作业的架子工们提出了战斗的口号：必须在最短的时间内搭成右岸的三八高程大跑道。这个任务是艰巨的。工地上的架子排三十多个架子工挺身而出，在排长王桂芳的率领下，登上高空，苦战三天，终于光荣地完成了任务。为了加速右岸工程进度，大坝现场指挥部要求潜水工必须在三天内完成二期围堰的合拢闭气。三天，这比第一期围堰工程合拢闭气的时间要缩短十分之九。潜水工接到这个艰巨任务后，立即用木板、麻袋、草捆去堵水。由于水的吸引力很大，碗口粗的木头，向下一放，“扑”的一声，就被吸走了。正在紧急的时候，老潜水工姚新根忽然想到用麻袋装砂石料去堵水的办法，他带了几个潜水工赶到工地，漏夜苦战，结果提前八小时完成了任务。
    新安江水电站就是以这样的惊人速度向前飞跃的。这个水电站原计划是1961年发电，全国大跃进以后，新安江水电站的党委会又提出力争在今年内提前发电。原来水电站的造价是四亿零三百八十四万元，现在却降低到二亿五千万元；在算这笔账的时候，工人们拍拍胸脯子说：“我们不仅和时间赛跑，而且还要多省点资金。因为党告诉我们要多、快、好省，我们一定记住党的这句话，把新安江修成一个多快好省的电站。”（附图片）
