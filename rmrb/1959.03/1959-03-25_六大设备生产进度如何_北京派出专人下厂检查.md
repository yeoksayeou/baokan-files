How is the Production Progress of the Six Major Equipment?
Beijing Sends Specialists to Factories for Inspection

    (Our Newspaper) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the seven district committees have, since March 10th, formed inspection teams to go to the sites of relevant electromechanical factories to urge the rush production of the six major equipment categories—mining, steel rolling, coal washing and coking, power stations, locomotives and rolling stock, and irrigation and drainage machinery—and their supporting equipment.

    As of now, the inspection teams have inspected more than eighty units. These include the Beijing Third General Machinery Factory, which manufactures mining equipment; the Beijing Pipe Fittings Factory, which manufactures steel rolling mills; the Beijing Steam Turbine Generator Factory and the Liangxiang Repair Factory, which manufacture power station equipment; the Beijing Cold Air Machinery Factory, which manufactures coal washing and coking equipment; the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the Nankou Parts Manufacturing Factory, which manufacture locomotives and rolling stock and their accessories; the Beijing First General Machinery Factory, which manufactures irrigation and drainage machinery; the Beijing Switch Factory, which manufactures power station equipment supporting equipment; and the Beijing Steel Plant, which supplies steel castings for the six major equipment categories. Based on the national unified planning concept, the inspection teams specifically checked the following issues at these units: First, the completion of plans for the six major equipment categories and their supporting equipment; second, the material supply situation; third, the ordering and arrival of cooperative parts; fourth, the utilization of equipment, utilization of working hours, and consumption of materials; fifth, the work of the Party and the mobilization of the masses. The inspection team members inspected the sites of each factory, consulted with the masses, and discussed with the Party organizations of the enterprises.

    The inspection clarified the situation, tapped potential, and solved many problems. The Beijing Steel Plant, which supplies steel castings for the six major equipment categories, originally planned to produce only 400 tons of steel castings in the first quarter. After this inspection, it was found that the main reason limiting the steel casting capacity was insufficient sand removal capacity. Therefore, they firmly grasped this key issue, adjusted the labor force, adjusted the equipment, and adopted advanced experiences such as sandblasting for sand removal. After taking this series of measures, it is expected that the steel casting plan for the first quarter can be overfulfilled by more than 150 tons.

    Through inspection, many units have further strengthened their mutual cooperation. The Beijing Third General Machinery Factory planned to produce mining and ore dressing equipment in the first quarter—scraper conveyors, bucket elevators, and other machines. Most of the parts had been manufactured, but because the steel castings were not supplied in time, the products could not be assembled and leave the factory. In the spirit of the national unified planning, the Beijing Crane Factory immediately and automatically obeyed the orders from above, released a portion of its own steel castings, and gave priority to the Beijing Third General Machinery Factory.

    Through this inspection, the leaders of many enterprises have become more aware of the situation, and the masses have become clearer about the importance of rushing to produce the six major equipment categories. A more vigorous new situation has emerged in production. It was difficult for the Low-Voltage Electrical Appliance Factory to complete a portion of its products. During the inspection process, after the masses learned about the serious impact of the incomplete variety plan on the national power station construction, the workshops held skill competitions one after another, and the workers suggested adjusting equipment and manpower. Now it can be guaranteed that the variety plan will be completed according to plan. While striving to complete the first quarter plan, the employees of the Beijing Third General Machinery Factory are actively preparing for production in the second quarter. The factory leaders have been holding meetings day and night these days. After detailed accounting, they decided to shorten the battle line, reduce the production tasks of other non-priority equipment, and concentrate their efforts on rushing to produce mining and ore dressing equipment. The employees actively support this measure of the leadership, and are now brewing to launch a labor competition centered on complete sets, high quality, and high output.

    六大设备生产进度如何
    北京派出专人下厂检查
    本报讯　中共北京市委和七个区委，从3月10日起，分别组成检查组，到各有关机电工厂的现场，督促赶制矿山、轧钢、洗煤炼焦、电站、机车车辆、排灌机械六大设备及其配套设备。
    截至目前为止，检查组已检查了八十多个单位。其中有制造矿山设备的北京第三通用机械厂，制造轧钢机的北京管件厂，制造电站设备的北京汽轮发电机厂和良乡修造厂，制造洗煤炼焦设备的北京冷风机械厂，制造机车车辆及其配件的长辛店机车车辆工厂和南口配件制造厂，制造排灌机械的北京第一通用机械厂，制造电站设备配套的北京开关厂，以及供给六大设备铸钢件的北京钢厂等。检查组在检查这些单位的全国一盘棋思想的基础上，具体检查了以下一些问题：第一，六大设备及其配套设备的计划完成情况；第二，材料供应情况；第三，协作件订货与到货情况；第四，设备利用、工时利用和材料消耗情况；第五，党的工作和群众发动情况。检查组人员在各厂现场一边检查，一边同群众一起商量，并同各企业的党组织共同讨论。
    检查结果，弄清了情况，挖出了潜力，许多问题得到了解决。给六大设备制造铸钢件的北京钢厂，原来第一季度只计划生产四百吨铸钢件，经过这次检查，摸清了限制铸钢能力的原因，主要是清砂能力不足，于是就狠狠地抓住这个关键问题，调整了劳动力，调整了设备，并采用喷砂机清砂等先进经验。在采取了这一系列措施以后，预计第一季度铸钢件计划可超产一百五十多吨。
    通过检查，很多单位进一步加强了互相间的协作关系。北京市第三通用机械厂第一季度计划生产的矿山洗选设备——刮板运输机、斗子式提升机等机器，绝大部分的部件都已制成，只因铸钢件供给不上，因此配不成套，产品不能出厂。北京市起重机厂根据全国一盘棋的精神，立即自动服从上级调动，把本厂的一部分铸钢件让出来，尽先供应北京市第三通用机械厂。
    通过这次检查，许多企业的领导更加心中有数，广大群众更加清楚了赶制六大设备的重要意义，生产上出现了更加蓬勃的新局面。低压电器厂有一部分产品不容易完成，在检查过程中，群众知道了品种计划完不成对国家电站的严重影响后，各车间就纷纷召开比武大会，职工们纷纷建议调整设备和人力，现在已可保证按计划完成品种计划。北京市第三通用机械厂职工在争取完成第一季度计划的同时，积极进行第二季度的生产准备工作。工厂的领导干部这几天日夜开会，经过详细核算，决定缩短战线，削减其他非重点设备的生产任务，集中力量突击生产矿山洗选设备。职工们积极支持领导上的这个措施，现正酝酿掀起一个以成套、优质、高产为中心的劳动竞赛。
