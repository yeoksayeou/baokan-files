    Active Rural Cultural Life
    The People's University of the Collective Farm
    In Stepanovka village, Poltava Oblast, Ukraine, Soviet Union, a new sign has appeared in front of the club, reading "Kalinin Collective Farm People's University." Every Friday evening is the time for classes at the oblast's first such farm university. The students are the collective farm's group leaders, production team leaders, milkmaids, tractor drivers, and others.
    The Kalinin Collective Farm is a wealthy farm, receiving an income of eight million rubles last year. This year, the farm has set an even larger production plan, and to complete this production plan requires new knowledge. The People's University of the farm was thus born.
    The first lesson of the university is divided into two sections. The first section is a lecture by a Deputy Doctor of Economics on "The 21st Congress of the CPSU is the Congress of Communist Builders." The second section is "Using Pavlov's Theory to Increase Livestock Productivity," lectured by an Academician of the Ukrainian Republic Academy of Sciences.
    The curriculum of this People's University includes courses in agriculture, economics, and culture. The teachers are all professors and lecturers from Poltava higher education institutions.
    Performing for the People Reclaiming Wasteland
    This year, many Soviet theater and music groups have proposed to expand their performances for rural residents, especially to greatly increase performances for state farms and collective farms in newly reclaimed areas.
    To fulfill this guarantee, the famous Moscow Art Theater and Maly Theater have formed a joint performance group, led by People's Artist Kudryavtsev, and at the beginning of the year, they have already held forty performance meetings in Karaganda Oblast, Kazakh Republic. Their program includes famous plays such as "Lyubov Yarovaya" and songs. Many other theaters in various places, including the amateur theater of Moscow University students, will go to the reclamation areas one after another this year to perform for the people reclaiming the wasteland. In total, this year, various theatrical groups will organize three thousand performances in the reclamation areas of the Kazakh Republic alone. (Attached picture)
    With the improvement of material life, the members of the Soviet collective farms have also increased their demand for spiritual food. The "Friendship of All Peoples" collective farm in Crimea Oblast recently established a permanent art exhibition hall, collecting seventy pieces of paintings, sculptures, and prints. The photograph shows a corner of the exhibition hall, displaying gifts from Crimean artists.

    活跃的农村文化生活
    集体农庄的人民大学
    在苏联乌克兰波尔塔瓦州斯皆潘诺夫卡村，俱乐部门前新出现了一个牌子，上面写着“加里宁集体农庄人民大学”。每星期五晚上是州内这第一所农庄大学上课的时间。学生是农庄的小组长、生产队长、挤奶员、拖拉机手等人。
    加里宁农庄是个富裕的农庄，去年得到了八百万卢布的收入。今年农庄订了更大的生产计划，要想完成这个生产计划就需要新的知识。农庄的人民大学就这样诞生了。
    大学的第一课共分两节。第一节课是经济学副博士讲的“苏共第二十一次代表大会是共产主义建设者的代表大会”。第二节课是“利用巴甫洛夫学说来提高牲畜的产品率”，主讲人是乌克兰共和国的一位科学院士。
    这个人民大学的教学大纲包括农业、经济和文化等方面的课程。教员都是波尔塔瓦高等学校的教授和讲师。
    为开荒的人们演出
    今年，苏联许多剧团和乐团都提出了扩大为农村居民演出的保证，特别要大大增加为新垦区的国营农场和集体农庄的演出。
    为了实现这项保证，莫斯科著名的艺术剧院和小剧院已经组成了联合演出组，在人民演员库德梁夫采夫的率领下，年初已经到哈萨克共和国卡拉干达州举行了四十次演出会。他们的节目包括有“柳鲍芙·雅洛瓦雅”等名剧和歌曲。其他各地许多剧团，包括莫斯科大学学生的业余剧团，今年都要先后前往开荒地区为拓荒的人们表演。总计今年各戏剧团体仅在哈萨克共和国开荒地区即要组织三千次演出。（附图片）
    随着物质生活的提高，苏联集体农庄的庄员们对精神食粮的需求也提高了。克里米亚州“各族人民的友谊”集体农庄不久前建立了一个常设的艺术陈列室，搜集了七十件绘画、雕刻和版画作品。照片上是陈列室的一角，摆设的是克里米亚美术家送来的礼物。
