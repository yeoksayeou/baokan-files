    Vigorously Create Mine Prop Forests
    In order to ensure the supply of mine props for coal mines, Huainan City has launched a vigorous afforestation campaign throughout the city, planning to achieve self-sufficiency in mine props (pit wood) within five years. Coal mining bases in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, and Datong, Shanxi Province, are also vigorously creating pit wood forests, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in mine props within a few years. This approach deserves strong promotion.
    The amount of mine props used in the coal industry accounts for the largest proportion of wood used in industrial and mining enterprises nationwide. Although the national output of mine props has been increasing year by year, it still cannot meet the needs of coal mines. Because most of the forests are concentrated in remote mountainous areas in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and some parts of Southwest China, major coal mining bases such as Tangshan, Datong, and Jiaozuo are distributed in North China, where forests are sparse. The consumption of mine props in the six provinces of Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Liaoning accounts for about half of the national total, but the local supply capacity only accounts for 10%-20% of the demand. A large number of mine props have to be transported from northern Northeast China and Inner Mongolia over long distances. This increases the burden on railway transportation, raises production costs, and may even affect production due to the untimely supply of mine props.
    To solve the problem of tight mine prop supply, one method is to reduce consumption; more importantly, it is to increase sources. Therefore, on the one hand, forestry departments should vigorously increase production, fully utilize treetop wood and small-diameter timber as mine props, and coal mining departments should tap potential, reduce mine prop consumption, and experiment with and promote substitutes; on the other hand, it is necessary to vigorously create mine prop forests near mining areas and establish timber bases. From a national perspective, if various localities create 5 million to 10 million mu of fast-growing and high-yielding mine prop forests within two to three years, after about ten years of growth, they can produce 30 million to 60 million cubic meters of mine prop timber annually, which will ensure the needs of coal industry development. Therefore, planting mine prop forests is a fundamental measure to solve the problem of pit wood supply. Creating mine prop forests can not only supply timber nearby and reduce the burden of railway transportation, but also make the areas near the mines green and lush, reduce coal dust in the air, and help workers' health. Therefore, all provinces (regions), cities, and counties with coal mines can follow the example of Huainan and other places, and according to the layout of coal mines and the planning of production development, make plans for creating mine prop forests, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in mine props within five or six years, or more. When planning to create mine prop forests, attention should be paid to selecting land, preferably reclaimed land, sandy land, river滩地, and spaces around houses in plains areas with better soil, or increase density and width when planting trees around houses. Fast-growing tree species such as poplar, willow, black locust, Chinese toon, Chinaberry, eucalyptus, and elm should be used, and high-yield measures should be implemented to achieve rapid growth.
    The people's communes near the mining areas should include the creation of mine prop forests in the overall production plan of the commune and in the landscaping plan, and according to the annual afforestation tasks, arrange seed collection and seedling cultivation, establish forest farms and professional teams, and actively carry out afforestation activities. At the same time, coal mine forest farms that have been creating mine prop forests for several years should continue to carry out afforestation according to the plan, making it a part of the entire coal mine production and construction, and combining it with the landscaping work of the mining area. In addition, state-owned forest farms in the mining area should not only regard the creation of mine prop forests as a central task, but also conscientiously help communes and related forest farms in technical guidance and promotion of high-yield measures. In this way, it is possible to strive to change the current situation of tight mine prop supply in a short period of time.
    Currently, various localities are successively launching a spring afforestation upsurge. Cities, counties, people's communes, coal mine forest farms, and state-owned forest farms in the mining area should seize the good spring season, seize the time to create mine prop forests, and work together to rapidly meet the mine prop timber needed by the coal industry.

    大造矿柱林
    淮南市为了保证煤矿矿柱的供应，全市开展了一个轰轰烈烈的造林运动，计划在五年内做到矿柱（坑木）自给。河北省唐山专区、山西省大同等煤矿基地，也都在大造坑木林，争取几年内做到矿柱自给。这种做法值得大大提倡。
    煤炭工业用的矿柱，数量占全国工矿所用木材的第一位。虽然全国矿柱产量年年增加，但是还不能满足煤矿的需要。由于森林大部分集中在东北、内蒙古和西南一些边远的山区，而主要煤矿基地，如唐山、大同、焦作等却分布在森林稀少的华北一带。陕西、山东、山西、河南、河北、辽宁六省矿柱用量占全国一半左右，但当地供应能力只占需用量的10％—20％，大量的矿柱要迢迢千里地从东北北部、内蒙古运来。这样既增加了铁路运输的负荷，也提高了生产成本，甚至会由于矿柱供应不及时而影响生产。
    解决矿柱供应紧张的问题，一个办法是节流；更重要的是开源。因此，一方面林业部门要大力增加产量，充分利用梢头木和小径级材作矿柱，煤矿部门要挖掘潜力，减少矿柱消耗，试验和推广代用品；另一方面，在矿区附近需要大造矿柱林，建立用材基地。从全国来说，如果各地在两三年内造快速丰产矿柱林五百万至一千万亩，十年左右成材后，每年就能生产三千至六千万立方公尺的矿柱材，这样就保证了煤炭工业发展的需要。因此，植造矿柱林是解决坑木供应问题的根本措施。造了矿柱林，不仅能够就近供应，减轻铁路运输的负担，而且使矿区附近绿荫丛丛，减少空气中的煤尘，有助于工人健康。因此，凡是有煤矿的省（区）、市、县都可以仿照淮南等地的做法，根据煤矿的布局和生产发展的规划，做出营造矿柱林的规划，争取五、六年或者更多一些时间内做到矿柱自给。在规划造矿柱林的时候，要注意选择土地，最好选土壤较好的平原地区的退耕地、沙滩地、河滩地、四旁隙地，或在四旁植树时加密加宽。树种要采用速生树种，如杨、柳、洋槐、椿树、苦栋、桉树、榆树等，并且贯彻丰产措施，以便迅速成材。
    矿区附近的各人民公社应该把造矿柱林列入本社的整个生产规划，和园林化规划之内，并且根据逐年营造的任务，安排采种育苗工作，建立林场、专业队，积极开展造林活动。同时，几年来一直在造矿柱林的煤矿林场，仍应根据计划继续进行造林，使之成为整个煤矿生产建设的一部分，与矿区园林化工作结合起来。此外，矿区所在地的国营林场不仅要把造矿柱林当做一项中心任务，还应该在技术指导和推广丰产措施上，认真帮助公社和有关林场。这样就可以争取在短时期内，改变目前矿柱供应紧张的情况。
    现在，各地正在接二连三地掀起春季造林高潮，各矿区所在地的市、县、人民公社、煤矿林场、国营林场要趁大好春光，抓紧造矿柱林，为迅速满足煤炭工业所需要的矿柱用材而共同努力。
