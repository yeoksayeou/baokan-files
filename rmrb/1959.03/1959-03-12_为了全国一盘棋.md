　　In the bright spring sunshine, the banks of the Huangpu River are sounding the call for an even greater leap forward: "Increase the total industrial output value by another 55% on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and increase labor productivity by another 40% to 50%, and under the deployment of the whole country as one chessboard, strive to overfulfill the glorious tasks assigned by the state." The call to new battle has quickly spread throughout Shanghai. From the Jiangnan Shipyard, with nearly a century of history, to the newly established Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, from large-scale textile printing and dyeing joint enterprises to small alleyway repair workshops... Everywhere is a competition to see who is more advanced, and a magnificent and vigorous upsurge in production competition has begun.

　　This year's goal for the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai's industrial production is to increase the total output value by another 55%, which is an extraordinary indicator. During last year's Great Leap Forward, Shanghai's total industrial output value increased by 50.3%, with an absolute value increase of 5.4 billion yuan. This increase was greater than the total increase in the five years of the First Five-Year Plan, which was already an unprecedented speed. This year, a further increase of 55% will bring the total annual output value to 26.5 billion yuan, an increase of 9.4 billion yuan over the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. This increase even exceeds the total industrial output value of Shanghai in 1955.

　　Glorious Duty

　　The rich significance of this year's indicator also lies in the magnificent picture it contains of comprehensively developing and supporting the country's socialist construction. Shanghai's steel output is to reach 1.6 million tons, almost one-tenth of the national task. The production of machinery and electrical industries is to double, and the production of other chemical, light, and textile industries will also see significant development. This year, Shanghai will not only produce complete sets of equipment, but also various parts and accessories; not only high-end, large, and precision products, but also various products needed by the people of the whole country for daily use. Therefore, the 55% increase indicator means batches of large rolling mill equipment, forging equipment, power generation equipment, mining equipment, paper-making equipment...; means 10,000-ton freighters, high-end cars, precision instruments, heavy and precision machine tools; means more printed fabrics, food, watches, sewing machines, bicycles...

　　These days, people on both sides of the Huangpu River are discussing this even greater leap forward indicator with unparalleled excitement. Everyone has a common feeling: achieving this indicator is the Shanghai workers' and all working people's lofty responsibility and glorious duty to the country's socialist construction, and it is also the greatest interest of all the people of Shanghai. Such an indicator should not only be completed, but also be prepared to exceed it and break through it. Because the faster the production development of Shanghai, the country's largest industrial base, the more powerfully it can support the country's Great Leap Forward, and the more it conforms to the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard. Just like an athlete who may achieve excellent results must make the greatest effort to create a new record, otherwise it will affect the team's total score and the team's honor. This is the Shanghai working class's understanding of the whole country as one chessboard, and it is also the new style of the Shanghai working class in this year's Great Leap Forward.

　　One Person Equals One and a Half

　　The 55% increase in Shanghai's industrial output value, this inspiring indicator, not only marks the rapid speed and large scale of the leap forward, but also has a clear characteristic, that is, to achieve it by increasing labor productivity without adding a single person. There are two ways to develop social productive forces at high speed in industry: one is to expand and build new industrial enterprises and expand the workforce, and the other is to continuously improve the labor productivity of existing enterprises. From the perspective of Shanghai, this industrial base, it is necessary to expand and build some key enterprises this year to meet the needs of a greater leap forward, but more importantly, it is necessary to continuously improve the labor productivity of existing enterprises. Shanghai's emphasis on continuously improving labor productivity has its great practical significance: it can fully utilize the potential of this industrial base, save the country's investment, and use it for new key projects, which is also a manifestation of fully utilizing local initiative under the guidance of the principle of the whole country as one chessboard. At the same time, emphasizing the continuous improvement of labor productivity also has its far-reaching political significance. Lenin once pointed out: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and fundamental condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." Continuously improving labor productivity reflects the objective law of the rapid development of Shanghai, this industrial base, and reflects the Shanghai workers' will and desire to build a socialist country at the fastest speed.

　　In the past few years, labor productivity in Shanghai's industry has been increasing year by year, but the potential is still great. Among the workers in the city's industrial enterprises, only 27% are engaged in mechanized operations, 36% are engaged in semi-mechanized operations, and the remaining 37% are still engaged in manual operations. If some reforms are made to manual and semi-mechanized operations, and old soldiers are replaced with new guns, labor productivity can be greatly improved. Therefore, Comrade Ke Qingshi proposed at the Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference that this year's labor productivity should be increased by 40%-50%, striving for one person to equal one and a half people last year, and one hour to equal one and a half hours last year. This resounding slogan has spread throughout the city's large and small factories.

　　"Old soldiers" are actively thinking of ways to replace "new guns," "new soldiers" are working hard to catch up with "old soldiers," the backward are striving to catch up with the advanced, labor organization is constantly improving, and a mass movement centered on improving labor productivity has been launched. Many workers have ambitiously made the oath of "one person equals five people" and "one person equals ten people." Peng Dasheng, a lathe worker at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, recently improved a processing method, increasing efficiency sixfold. Now he announces that he will continue his efforts to innovate technology and complete fifteen years of work in one year. Zhang Baofu, Xu Longyun, and other workers at the Xinyue Electrical Machinery Factory created five new records in one day, increasing efficiency more than tenfold. Worker Zhu Zengtai used a hard alloy knife to quickly cut threads to process a kind of screw, and the efficiency was increased by fifty times compared with the plan. Ding Xingqing, a lathe worker at the Huatong Switch Factory, and his colleagues made an electrically controlled automatic lathe, which one person can operate several. Jingye Machine Factory also improved production efficiency by improving labor organization methods. After they adjusted the position of machine tools in the workshop and implemented assembly line operations, the time for manufacturing oil accessories sprockets was shortened from the original sixty days to twenty days.

　　Jump Up to Pick the Fruit

　　This greater leap forward indicator is not something that can be obtained by reaching out, but is a "fruit that needs to be jumped to pick." "Jumping" means carrying out mass movements on a larger scale, giving fuller and wider play to the power of the masses and the power of technical personnel, mobilizing all positive factors, and concentrating the wisdom of the masses to a greater extent, and further carrying out the technical revolution movement to solve key problems in production.

　　"Must jump, can jump; jump high, jump early" has become the action slogan of every factory and every worker in the city, and it is also a characteristic of the starting point of this year's greater leap forward in Shanghai's industrial production. Before and after the Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference, large and small factories and tens of thousands of workers have already started to jump.

　　Big-character posters are once again the pioneers of this year's Great Leap Forward. Since the opening of the industrial conference, hundreds of thousands of big-character posters are sweeping away obstacles on the road to progress. This year's big-character posters appear with a new attitude and new power. Almost all the big-character posters in the factories have raised the issue of improving quality. They not only have high requirements for cadres, but also have high requirements for production. A worker at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory posted a big-character poster on how to improve gears to a first-class level of accuracy, with fourteen items, proposing a complete set of suggestions from leadership methods, labor organization to production technology.

　　Factories fight factories, workshops fight workshops, and individuals fight individuals, making it difficult to distinguish the winners. Fighting competitions was an important method for carrying out mass production competitions in last year's Great Leap Forward, but this year's method is very different. The competitions not only focus on indicators, but also on measures and actual actions. In the Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, a worker group spent two days and two nights to formulate more than 300 measures to compete. A technician said after seeing their measures, "It's really better than reading ten years of books." It turned out that the workers in this group had written down their operating experience over the years, which is almost the most practical operating regulations.

　　"Despise difficulties strategically, and value difficulties tactically" has become the dialectic grasped by the masses of workers. The workers said: "The greater the difficulty, the greater the motivation." Indeed, they have mastered the method of carefully calculating accounts in their actions. Large and small factories are calculating accounts, and everyone is calculating carefully. The more carefully the accounts are calculated, the more measures are calculated, the greater the potential is calculated, the more sufficient the enthusiasm is calculated, and the higher the indicators are calculated and the more reliable they are calculated.

　　The workers of Jiangnan Shipyard, who fought day and night on the banks of the Huangpu River, sent a 5,000-ton train ferry into the water after a 29-day dock cycle, and then welded and installed a second 5,100-ton train ferry. They guarantee that the dock cycle will be shortened to 20 days while reducing the number of welding and installation personnel by more than half compared to the first ship.

    为了全国一盘棋
    本报驻上海记者
    春光明媚，黄浦江畔吹起了更大跃进的号角：“把工业总产值在去年大跃进的基础上再提高55％，劳动生产率再提高40％到50％，在全国一盘棋的部署下，为超额完成国家所交给的各项光荣任务而斗争。新的战斗的号召，迅速传遍了整个上海。从有近百年历史的江南造船厂到刚诞生不久的上钢五厂，从规模巨大的纺织印染联合企业到弄堂修配小工场……到处是摆擂台比先进，一个波澜壮阔、声势浩大的生产竞赛高潮已经开始了。
    今年上海全市工业生产大跃进的目标，是要把总产值再提高55％，这是一个不平凡的指标。去年的大跃进，上海工业总产值提高50.3％，绝对值增长五十四亿元，这个增长数，比第一个五年计划期间五年增长的总数还要大，这已经是一个空前的速度。今年再提高55％，全年总产值就要达到二百六十五亿元，比大跃进的1958年再增长九十四亿元。这个增长数，甚至超过了1955年上海全市的工业总产值。
          光荣的义务
    今年这个指标的丰富意义，还在于它包含着一幅全面发展和全面支援国家社会主义建设的宏伟图景。上海的钢产量要达到一百六十万吨，几乎占全国任务的十分之一，机械、电机工业的生产要翻一番，其他化工、轻工业、纺织工业生产也将有很大的发展。今年上海不仅要生产成套的设备，也要生产各种配件；不仅要生产高级、大型、精密的产品，也要生产全国人民日用所需的各类产品。因此，增长55％这个指标，意味着成批的大型的轧钢设备、锻压设备、发电设备、采矿设备、造纸设备……；意味着万吨巨轮、高级轿车、精密仪表、重型和精密的机床；意味着更多的花布、食品、手表、缝纫机、自行车……。
    这些天来，黄浦江两岸的人们正以无比兴奋的心情讨论着这个更大跃进的指标。人人有这样一个共同的感觉：实现这个指标，是上海工人和全体劳动人民对国家社会主义建设的崇高责任和光荣义务，也是全上海人民的最大的利益。这样的指标，不但要完成，而且还在准备超过它、突破它。因为上海这个全国最大的工业基地的生产发展愈快，就可以更加有力地支援全国的大跃进，也就愈符合全国一盘棋的精神。正如一个可能取得优秀成绩的运动员，必须尽最大努力创造新纪录，否则就会影响团体总分，团体的荣誉。这就是上海工人阶级对全国一盘棋的理解，也是今年大跃进中上海工人阶级的新风格。
      一个人顶一个半
    上海工业产值再提高55％，这个振奋人心的指标，不仅标志着跃进的速度快，规模大，还有一个鲜明的特点，就是要在不增加一个人的情况下，通过提高劳动生产率的办法来实现。在工业中高速度发展社会的生产力，有两种办法，一是扩建、新建工业企业和扩大工人队伍，一是不断提高原有企业的劳动生产率。从上海这个工业基地来说，今年必须扩建和新建若干关键性企业，适应更大跃进的需要，但是更重要的是不断提高现有企业的劳动生产率。上海强调不断提高劳动生产率，有它巨大的现实意义：即可以充分发挥这个工业基地的潜力，节省国家的投资，使其运用到新建的重点工程中去，这也是在全国一盘棋的方针指导下，充分发挥地方积极性的表现。同时，强调不断提高劳动生产率，也还有它的深远的政治意义。列宁曾经指出：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”不断提高劳动生产率，它反映了上海这个工业基地高速发展的客观规律，反映了上海工人以最快速度建设社会主义国家的意志和愿望。
    过去几年来，上海工业中劳动生产率逐年都有提高，但是潜力还是很大的。全市工业企业工人中从事机械化操作的仅占27％，半机械化操作的占36％，其余37％还是手工操作。如果将手工和半机械化操作作一些改革，老兵换上新枪，劳动生产率就可大大提高。因此，柯庆施同志在市委工业会议上提出今年提高劳动生产率40％—50％，争取一个人抵上去年的一个半人，一个小时抵上去年的一个半小时的号召，这个响亮的口号，传遍了全市大小工厂。
  “老兵”积极想办法换“新枪”，“新兵”努力赶“老兵”，落后的奋身赶先进，劳动组织不断改进，一个以提高劳动生产率为中心的群众运动已经展开。许多工人雄心勃勃地立下了“一人抵五人”“一人抵十人”的誓言。上海锅炉厂车工彭大生最近改进了一项加工方法，提高效率六倍，现在他宣布再接再厉，革新技术，今年一年要完成十五年的工作量，新业电工机械厂工人张保富、许龙云等一天创造五个新纪录，提高效率十多倍，工人朱增泰用硬质合金刀快速切丝法加工一种螺丝，效率比计划提高了五十倍。华通开关厂车工丁杏清和他的同伴制成了电气操纵自动车床，一个人可以操作几台。精业机器厂还通过改善劳动组织的方法提高生产效率，他们在车间调整机床位置，实行流水作业以后，制造石油配件链轮的时间，从原来的六十天缩短为二十天。
        跳起来摘果子
    这个更大跃进的指标，不是伸手就可以拿得到的，而是“需要跳一跳才能摘下来的果子”。“跳一跳”也就是要更大规模地开展群众运动，更充分更广泛地发挥群众的力量和技术人员的力量，把各方面的积极因素都调动起来，更大限度地集中群众的智慧，进一步开展技术革命运动，来解决生产中的关键。
      “必须跳、可以跳；跳得高、跳得早”，已经成为全市每一家工厂、每一个工人的行动口号，也是今年上海工业生产更大跃进的起点的一个特色。在市委工业会议的前后，大大小小的工厂和成千上万的工人，已经起步跳了。
    大字报，又是今年大跃进的开路先锋，在工业会议开幕以来，几十万张大字报正在横扫前进道路上的障碍。今年的大字报，以新的姿态、新的威力出现。几乎所有工厂的大字报，都提出了提高质量的问题，他们不但对干部的要求很高，对生产的要求也很高。上海机床厂一个工人贴出一张如何使齿轮提高到一级精度的大字报，洋洋十四条，从领导方法、劳动组织到生产工艺，提出了一整套的建议。
    工厂与工厂之间，车间与车间之间，个人与个人之间，打擂台打得难解难分。打擂台是去年大跃进中开展群众性生产竞赛的重要方法，但今年的打法有很大不同。打擂台不仅打指标，还要打措施、打实际行动。在杨浦棉纺织印染厂里，一个工人小组以两天两夜的心血，订出三百多条措施去打擂台。一个技术人员看到他们的措施后表示“真是胜读十年书”。原来这个小组工人把多少年来的操作经验都写进去了，几乎就是一本最实际的操作规程。
    “在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难”，已经成为工人群众掌握的辩证法。工人们说：“困难愈大，动力愈大”。的确是这样，他们在行动中都掌握了算细账的方法。大大小小的工厂都在算账，每个人都算细账。账愈算愈细，措施愈算愈多，潜力愈算愈大，干劲愈算愈足，指标愈算愈高也愈算愈可靠。（附图片）
    昼夜战斗在黄浦江畔的江南造船厂工人，用二十九天的船台周期把一条五千多吨的火车渡轮送下水后，又在焊装第二条五千一百吨的火车渡轮。他们保证在焊装人数比第一条减少一半以上的情况下，把船台周期再缩短到二十天。　　　　　　新华社记者　赵成、张萍摄
