Two brave generals of the commander's mansion,
Competing and helping each other,
Plant No. 3 raises the red flag,
Plant No. 1 vows not to yield.
You send me secrets,
I send you good formulas,
Great collaboration with each other,
Everything for steel.

Worker of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Wang Chenhu
