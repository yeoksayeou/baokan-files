Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 12th: The expansion project of the Tianjin Railway Hub has recently begun construction.

The main projects of the expansion are the construction of a large marshalling yard in both Xinhe and Nancang, and the construction of a large ring line around the Tianjin outer area. The Xinhe hump marshalling yard will be designed using advanced world technology, with all operations utilizing mechanical manipulation and electrical control.

The Tianjin hub is the gateway between regions inside and outside Shanhaiguan, and passenger and freight trains going north and south must pass through the Tianjin hub stations for sorting, marshalling, or loading and unloading. Last year, the freight volume of Tianjin Hub's seven stations increased by more than 60% compared to the previous year, and an even greater increase is expected this year. After the hub expansion project is completed and put into use this year, the marshalling capacity of Tianjin stations will be doubled, and the unloading capacity will be increased by one time.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 12th: The track-laying project of the Kunming-Yiliang railway line has been successfully completed on the 6th of this month.

The Kunming-Yiliang line is part of the future Chengdu-Kunming railway, is 125 kilometers long, and began construction in June last year. After this line is open to traffic, coking coal produced in Yiliang, an important coke production area in Yunnan, as well as grain, salt, timber and other materials along the line, can be continuously transported to Kunming and other cities; at the same time, mechanical equipment, daily necessities and other goods produced in Kunming can also be transported to various places along the line by train in a timely manner.

    天津铁路枢纽开始扩建
    昆一铁路铺轨完工
    新华社天津12日电　天津铁路枢纽扩建工程最近开始施工。
    扩建工程的主要项目是，在新河和南仓两地各建一个大编组站，在天津外围地区修建一条大环线。其中的新河驼峰编组站，将采用世界先进技术设计，全部利用机械操纵和电气控制。
    天津枢纽是关内外的咽喉，南往北去的客货列车都要经过天津枢纽各站进行分解、编组或装卸。去年天津枢纽的七个车站货运量比前年猛增60％以上，今年预计会有更大的增长。枢纽扩建工程今年建成交付使用以后，天津各车站编组能力共可提高两倍，卸车容量增加一倍。
    据新华社昆明12日电　昆（明）—（平浪）铁路线铺轨工程已经在本月6日胜利完工。
    昆一线是将来成（都）昆（明）铁路的一部分，长达一百二十五公里，去年6月开始动工。这条线路通车之后，云南重要产焦地—平浪所产的焦炭，以及沿线的粮食、食盐、木材等物资，可以源源运往昆明和其它城市；同时，昆明所产的机械设备、日用百货等，也可以用火车及时运往沿线各地。
