Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 24th: Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim said on the evening of the 23rd that Iraq is "rooting out imperialism."

He said he had found "the path to bury imperialism in this country and its neighboring countries. This path is to unleash a high tide of all people striving for freedom."

Prime Minister Qasim reiterated the goals of the July Revolution declaration of Iraq to establish a government and a republic of the people, governed by the people, and working according to the wishes of the people. He said that the Republic of Iraq was founded on this basis. We will continue to struggle and work for these goals.

He said that he would announce good news in the next five days.

Qasim said that Iraq "is a fortress of freedom and dignity. This republic composed of Arabs and Kurds will shine in history as an eternal flame. No one can launch aggression against it."
