Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 29th: Rice transplanting has begun on a large scale in Guangxi. Recently, more than 230 women rice transplanting experts, agricultural technicians, and women's work cadres from the Yulin and Wuzhou special districts held an on-site rice transplanting meeting in Xindi People's Commune, Cangwu County. Seventeen women rice transplanting experts participated in an intense and moving transplanting demonstration, kicking off the transplanting competition.

These seventeen female rice transplanters each transplanted a fen of land according to the specification of five by three, demonstrating who could transplant faster and better. During the competition, everyone was in high spirits and moved their hands and feet nimbly. Huang Guoying from Pingnan County divided the seedlings quickly and evenly, and completed transplanting one fen of land in 41.1 minutes. Moreover, she transplanted in vertical and horizontal rows, fully meeting the standards of close planting. Li Jingqun from Cangwu County adopted the weaving-style transplanting method, transplanting from left to right and then from right to left. Last year, she created an excellent record of transplanting more than 3.1 mu of land in one day. Zhong Xiuqing from Luchuan County not only used the weaving-style transplanting method, but also used both hands alternately. Cai Shaolian, a thirteen-year-old girl, had great ambitions despite her young age. Her specifications and speed were no lower than those of adults. As a result, she was rated as one of the most outstanding rice transplanters. This demonstration fully demonstrated the true qualities of Guangxi women's good labor.

At this on-site meeting, representatives from Luchuan, Cangwu, and other counties introduced their experience in organizing rice transplanting competitions. Some rice transplanting experts introduced advanced rice transplanting technologies. After serious discussions, the representatives of various counties were full of confidence in creating high records for rice transplanting. They immediately found targets at the meeting to launch challenges and accept challenges. All the representatives present also made a competition proposal to all rice transplanters in the entire autonomous region. The conditions of the competition are: on the basis of ensuring specifications and quality, strive to transplant more than one mu of rice per person per day, and strive to complete the rice transplanting task before Qingming Festival.

    看谁的手脚利落
    广西妇女插秧能手发起技术竞赛
    新华社南宁29日电　广西插秧大规模开始，最近玉林、梧州两专区的二百三十多个妇女插秧能手、农业技术干部和妇女工作干部在苍梧县新地人民公社举行插秧现场会，有十七位妇女插秧能手进行了一场紧张动人的插秧表演赛，揭开了插秧竞赛的序幕。
    这十七位女插秧能手，每人按照五乘三的规格各插一分田，表演看谁插得快，插得好。比赛中，个个意气风发，手脚利落。平南县黄桂英分秧又快又匀，一分田用四十一点一分钟就插完了，而且插得纵横成行，完全合乎密植标准。苍梧县李景群采取织布式的插秧法，从左往右插过去，又从右往左插过来。她去年曾创造过一天插三亩一分多田的优良成绩。陆川县钟秀清不仅用织布式插法，而且左右开弓，两手轮换插。十三岁的姑娘蔡少莲，人小志大，在规格和速度上都不低于成年人，结果被评为最优秀的插秧手之一。这场表演赛充分表现了广西妇女劳动好的本色。
    在这次现场会上，陆川、苍梧等县的代表介绍了他们组织插秧竞赛的经验。一些插秧能手介绍了先进插秧技术。各县代表经过认真讨论，对于创造插秧高纪录充满了信心，她们就在会上找对象展开挑战应战。全体到会代表还向全自治区所有插秧手提出竞赛倡议。竞赛的条件是：在保证规格质量的基础上，争取每人每天插秧一亩以上，力争在清明前完成插秧任务。（附图片）
