    Small Skiff
    Zhejiang Folk Song, Gu Yuan Woodcut
    Small skiff, carrying manure,
    Startles a large flock of water birds.
    Shakes the river full of stars,
    Shakes out a chimney full of smoke.
    Small skiff, carrying manure,
    The oar sways and the song echoes leisurely.
    Passes through willow clouds,
    Melts into the peach blossom mountain. (Image Attached)

    小篷船
    浙江民歌  古元木刻小篷船，装粪来，惊飞水鸟一大片。摇碎满河星，摇出满囱烟。小篷船，装粪来，橹摇歌响悠悠然。穿过柳树云，融进桃花山。（附图片）
