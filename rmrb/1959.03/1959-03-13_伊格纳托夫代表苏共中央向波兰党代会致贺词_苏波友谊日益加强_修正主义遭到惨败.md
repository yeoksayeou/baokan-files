    Reported here, Ignatov, head of the Soviet Communist Party delegation, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message at the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on March 11.

    Ignatov first conveyed warm fraternal greetings to the delegates of the Congress, and through them, to the Polish United Workers' Party and all the Polish people, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, all members of the CPSU, and all the Soviet people.

    Ignatov said, "On behalf of the members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Comrade Khrushchev himself, I extend sincere respect to your congress. They wish the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party success."

    Ignatov then pointed out that the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party is a major event not only for the Polish people but also for the people of all countries in the socialist camp.

    Because every step People's Poland takes on the road to socialism is its contribution to the cause of further consolidating the world socialist system. Ignatov said that the Soviet people, as Poland's true brothers and loyal friends, wholeheartedly stand with the Polish people, whether in days of victory or days of difficulty.

    Ignatov then elaborated on the Soviet Union's position on the German question, condemned the conspiracies of West German revanchists, and pointed out that the aggressive intentions of West German militarists are also directed against the Oder-Neisse border, which is now the western border of the People's Republic of Poland. The Bonn ruling clique's stubborn refusal to recognize this border, as well as the threat posed by West German revanchists to People's Poland, prove this point.

    It should have been understood long ago that the Oder-Neisse border is the only legitimate and reasonable border between Poland and Germany, and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries consider this border inviolable. We have pointed out more than once that anyone who attempts to undermine the existing borders of Poland or any other country in the socialist camp will have to deal with the Soviet Union and all participants of the Warsaw Pact, and we do not keep secret the fact that our socialist camp has corresponding tranquilizers to give to aggressors.

    We oppose the "Cold War" and any other war, and we make every effort to normalize the international situation. However, the aggressors in Western countries are precisely unhappy about this. As soon as there is a slight easing of the international situation, some politicians in the West immediately become agitated and try by all means to restore the permanent freeze. However, this policy of imperialism cannot weaken the determination of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries in the socialist camp to fight for the noble cause of strengthening world peace.

    Speaking of the current problems of the international workers' movement, Ignatov said: "Revisionism has always been the most vicious enemy of the international workers' movement. Today, revisionists are also trying to find cracks in the walls of our communist edifice in order to undermine the ideological unity of communist and workers' parties. But they have suffered a shameful defeat everywhere. The modern revisionists in the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have not been able to lead any fraternal party away from the path of Marxism-Leninism. Revisionists have exposed their despicable faces nakedly before the working class, and the Marxist-Leninist unity of communist and workers' parties has become more consolidated. The historically significant declaration adopted at the famous Moscow meeting by the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries has great significance for further uniting the international communist movement.

    The Polish United Workers' Party and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Gomulka defeated the revisionists, defeated their attempts to undermine the achievements of the Polish socialist revolution, and made the Polish working people more closely united around the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    Ignatov pointed out that Comrade Gomulka's profound and rich report powerfully demonstrated the great achievements made by the Polish people. These achievements are the result of the Polish people's tenacious and selfless labor under the leadership of their glorious Marxist-Leninist party—the Polish United Workers' Party. The report also mentioned that your party and all the Polish people still have many unresolved tasks and difficulties in socialist construction. A tense struggle is being waged against the reactionary forces who stubbornly resist and are supported by external forces.

    The imperialists and their lackeys—the revisionists—not long ago hoped to separate the Polish people from the fraternal family of socialist countries, hoping it would argue with the Soviet people, and hoping to eliminate the socialist achievements of the Polish working people.

    Now everyone sees that these cunning plans have been shamefully defeated. Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, your working people have repelled the attacks of the reactionaries, successfully overcome the difficulties in socialist construction, and are advancing confidently along the broad road of socialism.

    The Polish communists, the heroic Polish working class, and all the Polish working people have once again convincingly demonstrated that they do not want and do not consider any other road except the road of building a new, socialist society.

    The relations between communist and workers' parties are built on the principles of proletarian internationalism, voluntary cooperation, and mutual assistance. All fraternal parties are completely independent and equal. There is no superior party and subordinate party in the communist movement. Each of our parties uses Marxist-Leninist theory and combines it with the characteristics and peculiarities of our own country to lead socialist construction. The relationship between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Polish United Workers' Party is a vivid example of this relationship. Close fraternal friendship exists between our two parties and the people of our two countries. This friendship was born as early as the common revolutionary struggle of the Russian and Polish proletariats against exploiters and oppressors. This friendship is being consolidated and deepened year by year, and our fraternal ties are developing and expanding year by year. The visit of the delegation of the People's Republic of Poland headed by Comrade Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, to the Soviet Union once clearly proved this, and the upcoming visit of the party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to your country will also prove this.

    The fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two parties are precious achievements, and its significance is inestimable. Under the conditions of socialist countries, when the Marxist-Leninist party becomes the leading force of society, the relationship between parties determines the entire relationship between our two peoples and two countries. Therefore, we communists will continue to do everything possible in the future to continue to strengthen the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Polish United Workers' Party.

    CPSU Central Committee's Letter of Congratulations

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's letter of congratulation to the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party. The full text is as follows: Dear Comrade Delegates to the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party!

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the entire party and the Soviet people, extends warm fraternal greetings to all Polish communists and all the working people of the People's Republic of Poland through you, and sincerely wishes the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party success.

    The Polish working people, who are the heirs to the fine traditions of the revolutionary workers' movement and are united in the national united front, have achieved great victories in consolidating their people's democratic state, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and building socialism under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the long-tested vanguard of the Polish people.

    The Polish United Workers' Party is convening its Third Congress. It is the recognized organizer and leader of the working masses in carrying out socialist construction in the People's Republic of Poland.

    The Polish United Workers' Party resolutely defends the principles of proletarian internationalism, struggles against modern revisionism, and further strengthens the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. The Polish United Workers' Party has won the respect and gratitude of the fraternal parties—the Marxist-Leninist working-class parties—due to its loyalty to the solidarity of the international proletariat.

    The People's Republic of Poland has made a great contribution to the struggle against the revival of West German militarism by the socialist countries and the working people of the whole world, and for the elimination of the Cold War. It plays an active role in the international arena and unswervingly defends the cause of peace and security of all peoples.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union warmly congratulates the fraternal Polish United Workers' Party and all the Polish people on their new achievements in building a socialist society, developing the socialist national economy, culture and science, improving the material welfare of all Polish working people, and further strengthening the power of the socialist camp.

    Long live the fraternal Polish people building socialism!

    Long live the Polish United Workers' Party!

    May the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and Poland be consolidated and developed!

    May the unity of the countries of the socialist camp and the international communist movement be strengthened!

    Long live Marxism-Leninism!

                          The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

    伊格纳托夫代表苏共中央向波兰党代会致贺词
    苏波友谊日益加强  修正主义遭到惨败
    本报讯　苏联共产党代表团团长、苏共中央主席团委员、苏共中央书记伊格纳托夫3月11日在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会上致贺词。
    伊格纳托夫首先代表苏联共产党中央委员会、苏共全体党员和全体苏联人民向大会代表，并通过他们向波兰统一工人党和全体波兰人民转达热烈的兄弟敬意。
    伊格纳托夫说，我谨代表苏共中央主席团委员和赫鲁晓夫本人向你们代表大会致以真诚的敬意，他们祝波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会取得胜利。
    伊格纳托夫接着指出，波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会不仅对波兰人民、而且对社会主义阵营所有国家的人民都是一件大事。
    因为人民波兰在社会主义道路上每迈进一步都是它对进一步巩固世界社会主义体系事业的贡献。伊格纳托夫说，苏联人作为波兰真正的兄弟和忠诚的朋友，不论在胜利的日子或困难的日子里，都衷心地同波兰人民在一起。
    伊格纳托夫接着阐述了苏联在德国问题上的主张，谴责了西德复仇主义者的阴谋，他指出，西德军国主义者的侵略意图也针对现在波兰人民共和国西部的奥得—尼斯边界。波恩统治集团顽固地拒绝承认这个边界，以及西德复仇主义分子对人民波兰的威胁，都证明了这一点。
    早就应该明白，奥得—尼斯边界是波兰和德国之间唯一合法和合理的边界，苏联和其他社会主义国家认为这个边界是不可侵犯的。我们不止一次地指出，凡是企图破坏波兰国家或者社会主义阵营任何其他国家现存边界的人都需要同苏联和华沙条约的所有参加者打交道，而我们社会主义阵营有着给侵略者吃的相应的镇定剂，这一点我们并不保守秘密。
    我们反对“冷战”和任何其他战争，并且尽一切努力使国际局势正常化。但是西方国家的侵略者恰恰不高兴这一点。只要国际局势稍微有一点缓和，西方的某些政治家就马上激动起来，不择手段地要恢复常封的冰冻。但是，帝国主义的这种政策不能减弱苏联和整个社会主义阵营各国人民为加强世界和平的崇高事业而斗争的决心。
    在谈到国际工人运动当前问题时，伊格纳托夫说：修正主义一向是国际工人运动的极凶恶的敌人。修正主义者在今天也企图在我们共产主义大厦的墙壁上寻找裂缝，以便破坏共产党和工人党的思想上的团结一致。但是他们到处遭到了可耻的失败。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导中的现代修正主义者没有能使任何一个兄弟党离开马克思列宁主义的道路。修正主义者在工人阶级面前赤裸裸地暴露出卑鄙的面目，而共产党和工人党的马克思列宁主义的团结一致更加巩固了。在著名的莫斯科会议上所通过的社会主义国家共产党和工人党有历史意义的宣言，对进一步团结国际共产主义运动具有巨大的意义。
    波兰统一工人党及以哥穆尔卡同志为首的中央委员会击败了修正主义者，击败了他们想破坏波兰社会主义革命成就的企图，使波兰劳动人民更加密切地团结在不可战胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜的周围。
    伊格纳托夫指出，哥穆尔卡同志的深刻而内容丰富的报告，有力地表明了波兰人民获得的巨大成就，这些成就是波兰人民在自己光荣的马克思列宁主义政党——波兰统一工人党的领导下进行顽强和忘我劳动的结果。报告中还说到，你们党和全体波兰人民在社会主义建设中还有不少尚未解决的任务和困难。同顽固反抗的受到外力支持的反动势力进行着紧张的斗争。
    帝国主义者同他们的奴仆——修正主义者不久前还希望使波兰人民脱离社会主义国家的兄弟大家庭，希望它同苏联人民发生争执，希望消灭波兰劳动人民的社会主义成果。
    现在大家都看到，这些狡诈的打算已经遭到了可耻的失败。你们劳动人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，击退了反动派的进攻，顺利地克服了社会主义建设中的困难，充满信心地沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进。
    波兰的共产党员，英勇的波兰工人阶级和全体波兰劳动人民再次令人信服地表明，他们除了建设新的、社会主义社会的道路以外，不愿意也不考虑任何其他道路。
    共产党和工人党之间的相互关系是建筑在无产阶级国际主义原则、自愿合作和互助原则的基础上的。所有兄弟党都是完全独立的和平等的，在共产主义运动中没有上级党和下级党。我们每个党都运用马克思列宁主义理论并结合本国的特点和特性来领导社会主义建设。苏联共产党同波兰统一工人党的相互关系是这种关系的生动范例。在我们两党和两国人民之间存在着密切的兄弟友好关系，这种友好早在俄国和波兰无产阶级反对剥削者和压迫者的共同革命斗争时期就产生了。这种友谊正在一年年地巩固和加深，我们的兄弟联系在一年年地发展和扩大。以波兰统一工人党中央第一书记哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰人民共和国代表团到苏联的访问曾经明显地证明了这一点，以苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志为首的党和政府代表团即将对贵国进行的访问也将证明这一点。
    我们两党的兄弟友谊和合作是宝贵的成果，它的意义是不可估价的。在社会主义国家的条件下，当马克思列宁主义政党成为社会的领导力量的时候，党和党之间的相互关系确定着我们两国人民和两国之间的整个关系。因此，我们共产党人今后也将竭尽一切力量来继续全力加强苏联共产党和波兰统一工人党之间的兄弟友谊和紧密合作。苏共中央的贺信
    苏联共产党中央委员会致波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的贺信。全文如下：波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会亲爱的代表同志们！
    苏联共产党中央委员会代表全党和苏联人民向你们并通过你们向波兰全体共产党员，向波兰人民共和国全体劳动人民致以热烈的兄弟祝贺，并衷心地祝波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会成功。
    波兰革命工人运动优良传统的继承者、团结在民族统一战线中的波兰劳动人民，在波兰统一工人党——波兰人民久经考验的先锋队的领导下，在巩固自己的人民民主国家方面，在加强工农联盟和社会主义建设方面取得了巨大的胜利。
    波兰统一工人党召开了第三次代表大会，它是劳动群众在波兰人民共和国进行社会主义建设的公认组织者和领导者。
    波兰统一工人党坚决捍卫无产阶级国际主义的原则、同现代修正主义进行斗争，使社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结进一步加强。波兰统一工人党由于忠于国际无产阶级的团结一致，博得了各兄弟党——马克思列宁主义工人阶级政党的尊敬和感谢。
    波兰人民共和国在社会主义国家和全世界劳动人民反对西德军国主义复活，争取消除冷战的斗争中作出了巨大贡献，在国际舞台上起着积极的作用，始终不渝地保卫各国人民的和平与安全事业。
    苏联共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺兄弟波兰统一工人党和全体波兰人民在建设社会主义社会方面，在发展社会主义国民经济、文化和科学方面，在提高波兰全体劳动人民的物质福利方面，在进一步加强社会主义阵营威力的斗争方面取得新的成就。
    建设社会主义的兄弟波兰人民万岁！
    波兰统一工人党万岁！
    祝苏波两国牢不可破的兄弟友谊日益巩固和发展！
    祝社会主义阵营国家和国际共产主义运动的团结日益加强！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
                          苏联共产党中央委员会
