Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 9th -- According to Cambodian National Radio broadcasts, Cambodian government advisor Prince Sihanouk stated on the 8th that the death of the traitor Choeung Mochupich does not mean that the conspiracy against Cambodia has ended. He said that there are still some traitors alive and active in the border areas, attempting to establish another government to split Cambodia.

Prince Sihanouk, representing Prince Norodom Sihanouk, also said at the inauguration ceremony of the Kandal Province Assembly Hall that the traitor Son Ngoc Thanh not only sold himself to Thailand, but also sold himself to another country. Son Ngoc Thanh, along with two other traitors, Sam Sary and Choeung Mochupich, even agreed on who would be president, prime minister, and marshal if the conspiracy succeeded. He said that thanks to the unity and cooperation of the whole country, we extinguished this conspiracy.

When talking about Cambodia's foreign policy, Prince Sihanouk said that Cambodia's ideal is peace and neutrality. He also said that recently, when some foreigners asked him about Cambodia's inclinations, he asked in return: Which camp is currently aggressing against Cambodia? Since Cambodia is being invaded, why can't it express hatred towards the invaders? He said whether or not other countries can live in harmony with Cambodia is up to them, not up to Cambodia. However, Cambodia will not sit idly by and wait for death; it will always remain vigilant.

    柬埔寨宾努亲王指出
    必须警惕叛国分子的活动
    新华社金边9日电　据柬埔寨国家电台广播，柬埔寨政府顾问宾努亲王在8日说，叛国犯琼·莫舒皮的死亡，并不意味着反对柬埔寨的阴谋已经结束。他说，还有一些叛国分子活着，并且在边境地区进行活动，他们企图建立另一个政府来分裂柬埔寨。
    宾努代表西哈努克亲王在干丹省议会大厅的落成典礼上还说，卖国贼山玉成不仅把自己出卖给泰国，而且还把自己出卖给另一个国家。山玉成同另两个卖国贼桑·萨里和琼·莫舒皮甚至谈妥了如果阴谋成功，由谁当总统、总理和元帅。他说，由于全国的团结和合作，我们扑灭了这一阴谋。
    宾努在谈到柬埔寨的对外政策时说，柬埔寨的理想是和平和中立，他还说，最近当有些外国人问他关于柬埔寨的倾向时，他反问：那个阵营现在在侵略柬埔寨？既然柬埔寨遭到侵略，它为什么不能对侵略者表示仇恨呢？他说，是否能同柬埔寨和睦相处，这要由外国来决定，而不是由柬埔寨来决定。但是，柬埔寨不会坐以待毙，它始终保持着警惕。
