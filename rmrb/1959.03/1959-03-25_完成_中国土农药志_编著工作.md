Based on the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," Party committees in various regions led the masses in vigorously promoting the movement to create indigenous pesticides in 1958. Over the past year, various regions have discovered many varieties of indigenous pesticides, particularly creating many compound mixtures. At the same time, they have explored and accumulated rich experience in collection, preparation, usage, and storage. The vigorous promotion of the indigenous pesticide movement not only solved the shortage of chemical pesticides and promoted agricultural production, but also pointed out new directions for the future development of pesticide research. Not long ago, in order to further enhance the effectiveness of indigenous pesticides, ten relevant central units jointly formed the "Indigenous Pesticide Scientific Research Office" to conduct a series of scientific research on variety identification, chemical analysis, efficacy testing, refining and purification, and storage and preservation. Furthermore, based on the principles of popularization and improvement, the Indigenous Pesticide Scientific Research Office collectively compiled the book "A Compendium of Indigenous Chinese Pesticides," drawing on the experience of the broad masses, combined with the preliminary experiments of various collaborating units, and referencing relevant literature. This book is now about to be published by the Science Press.

"A Compendium of Indigenous Chinese Pesticides" is a popular and scientific work. The book lists a total of 404 single-use indigenous pesticides, 19 mineral and other indigenous pesticides, and 100 indigenous pesticide mixtures. The book includes color illustrations, key references, and several indexes. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also wrote a preface for the book. The publication of this book not only initially summarizes past experiences and meets the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, but will also be of great significance in eliminating the opposition between foreign and indigenous methods, especially the tendency to value foreign methods over indigenous ones.

    完成“中国土农药志”编著工作
    1958年各地党委根据“土洋并举”的方针，领导群众大搞土农药运动。一年来各地发掘了许多土农药的品种，特别是创造了不少附合混合剂，同时在采集、配制、使用和贮存等方面也摸索积累了丰富的经验。大搞土农药运动不仅解决了化学农药的不足，促进了农业生产，而且为今后农药研究的发展指出了新的方向。不久以前，为了进一步发挥土农药的效用，中央有关十个单位联合组成“土农药科学研究办公室”，对品种鉴定、化验分析、药效测定、精制提纯和贮存保管等，进行了一系列的科学研究。并且，土农药科学研究办公室还根据普及和提高的原则，以广大群众的经验为基础，结合各协作单位的初步试验，以及参考有关文献，集体编著成“中国土农药志”一书。现在，这本书即将由科学出版社出版。
    “中国土农药志”是一本大众化、科学化的著作。书中共列单用土农药四百零四种，矿物性和其他土农药十九种，土农药合剂一百种。书后附有彩色图谱、主要参考文献和几种索引等。中国科学院院长郭沫若还为这本书写了序。这本书的出版，不仅初步总结了以往的经验，将满足农业生产大跃进的要求，而且对消除洋土对立，特别是厚洋薄土的作风，也将具有重要的意义。
