Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 20th. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting in Paris yesterday and today.

The Central Committee heard Duclos's report on the results of the municipal elections and the tasks of the Party, Raymond Guyot's report on the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and a report on the preparations for the French Communist Party Congress to be held from May 27th to 31st. General Secretary Thorez made an important speech at the meeting.

Today, the Central Committee passed a resolution on Duclos's report. The resolution emphasized that the French Communist Party achieved a major victory in the municipal elections. Democratic voters, by voting for the candidate lists proposed or supported by the Communist Party, expressed their agreement with the Communist Party's policies and its strategy of uniting against reactionaries and fascists. They gave resolute resistance to the anti-democratic policies of personal dictatorship, poverty, and war. The resolution pointed out that the Party's victory was vividly demonstrated in Paris and throughout France.

The resolution pointed out that the results of this election prove that the National Assembly elected last November does not represent the French people, and it is composed of a majority of reactionaries and fascists.

The Central Committee believes that the achievements made in establishing an alliance of workers and democratic forces are one of the most important results of this municipal election. In order to prevent these results from being abandoned halfway, the Central Committee requests that the Communists, Socialists, and all Republicans who have united in the municipal elections consolidate this unity and make it lasting. The Central Committee calls on all party organizations and members to give full play to political initiative in order to strengthen ties with Socialists among the working people, expand joint actions, and guarantee the unity of all workers and democratic forces, in order to strive to realize the urgent political and economic demands of the French people.

Regarding the preparations for the Fifteenth Congress, the resolution calls on organizations at all levels and all party members to do their utmost to recruit thousands of new party members and establish hundreds of new party branches in factories, enterprises, cities, and villages, and among those men and women who supported the Party in the municipal elections.

The resolution concludes that the great achievements of the French Communist Party in the municipal elections will provide new impetus to the great struggle for the restoration of democratic freedoms, for the improvement of the living conditions of the working people, and for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 21st. Jacques Duclos, Secretary to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, made a report at the plenary session of the French Communist Party Central Committee, which concluded yesterday, on the results of the municipal elections and the tasks of the Party.

He emphasized that the results of this election showed the internal changes in the French people since the parliamentary elections last November, indicating that the Communist Party's influence is strengthening and the people's trust in the Communist Party is increasing.

When analyzing the results of the municipal elections, Duclos emphasized that the victory of the Communist Party and the growing unity of democratic and republican forces in the struggle against reactionaries have important political significance. He said that the election results showed that the reactionaries' plot to seize those municipal committees led by Communists, Socialists, and Republicans has failed.

Duclos continued by saying that the Communist Party ranks first in terms of the number of votes it received, accounting for 29.1% of the total votes. This is an increase of 300,000 votes compared to 1953. The significant victory gained by the French Communist Party – strengthened its position as the largest party in France.

Duclos said that the election results even exceeded the most optimistic projections, and they clearly exposed the deepening contradiction between dictatorial rule and the will of the people. The Union for the New Republic and other ruling parties suffered defeats.

A large part of Duclos's report analyzed the position of the French Socialist Party and expounded on the issue of united action between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

Duclos said that the Socialist Party leadership tried its best to prevent the Socialist Party members from forming an alliance with the Communists, and instead promoted the alliance of the Socialist Party members with various reactionary parties, including the Union for the New Republic.

Duclos went on to say that, however, the situation within the Socialist Party has now changed. Some Socialists participated in the joint lists of reactionaries, while others formed alliances with Communists and other Republicans.

Duclos emphasized that the fact that many Socialists, regardless of the opposition of the Socialist Party leadership, joined the Communists without hesitation and voted for the Communists is of great significance.

Duclos said that recently, the proposition that workers and democratic forces must form an alliance has more widely penetrated the minds of working people and democrats. He emphasized that Communists should not only maintain but also strengthen the contacts that have already been established with Socialists.

Duclos then talked about the tasks of the Communist Party. He said that the masses' dissatisfaction with the government's policies has been politically manifested during the municipal elections. However, this dissatisfaction is only the beginning of the tireless struggle for unity in action.

Duclos emphasized that for all party members, the most important and urgent issue is to carry out the struggle to safeguard the interests of the working masses. He pointed out that recently, the struggle carried out by the working people to meet their own economic demands is becoming larger and larger in scale. He said that the characteristic of this rising struggle is the unity of action of trade unions in various industries.

Duclos pointed out that the current government's economic and financial policies are opposed by the French working class and the masses of the people; these policies are closely related to the continued Algerian war. Duclos emphasized that the unadulterated colonial nature of de Gaulle's policies should be explained in the face of the national liberation movements in the colonies and dependent countries.

Duclos then talked about the European situation, especially the situation in Germany and Berlin. He pointed out the great significance of the Soviet Union's proposals on a German peace treaty and the Berlin issue, and severely condemned the policies of the French government. He pointed out that the French government is not committed to easing international tensions, but instead ties its fate to West German militarists. It also stubbornly refuses to recognize the German Democratic Republic.

    法共中央就杜克洛报告通过决议指出
    法共在市政选举中获得重大胜利
    号召全体党员扩大联合行动保证工人和民主力量的团结
    新华社巴黎20日电　法国共产党中央委员会昨天和今天在巴黎举行会议。
    中央委员会听取了杜克洛关于市政选举结果和党的任务的报告、雷蒙·居约关于苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的报告，以及关于将于5月27日至31日召开的法国共产党代表大会准备工作的报告。总书记多列士在会上作了重要发言。
    今天中央委员会就杜克洛的报告通过了一项决议。决议强调说，法国共产党在市政选举中获得了重大胜利。民主的选民们用投票支持共产党所提出的或支持的候选人名单，来表示他们同意共产党的政策和它的团结起来反对反动派和法西斯的策略。他们对个人专政以及贫困和战争的反民主政策给予了坚决的抵抗。决议指出，在巴黎和在法国全国，党的胜利都得到了生动的证明。
    决议指出，这次选举结果证明，去年11月选举产生的国民议会，不代表法国人民，它是由反动分子和法西斯分子构成的多数组成的。
    中央委员会认为：在建立工人和民主力量的联盟方面所取得的成就，是这次市政选举的一个最重要的结果。为了使这些结果不致有始无终，中央委员会要求在市政选举中已经团结起来的共产党人、社会党人和一切共和人士巩固这种团结，并且使这种团结持久，中央委员会号召所有党组织和党员，发挥政治主动性，以便加强同劳动人民中的社会党人的联系，扩大联合行动，保证一切工人和民主力量的团结，以争取实现法国人民迫切的政治和经济要求。
    关于十五次代表大会的准备工作，决议要求各级组织和全体党员竭尽全力在工厂、企业、城市和农村中，在那些曾在市政选举中支持党的男女公民中吸收数以千计的新党员，建立数以百计的新的党支部。
    决议最后说，法国共产党在市政选举中取得的巨大成就将对争取恢复民主自由、争取改善劳动人民生活条件、争取和平的伟大斗争提供新的动力。
    新华社巴黎21日电　法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛在昨天结束的法共中央全会上作了关于市政选举结果和党的任务的报告。
    他强调指出，这次选举结果表明了法国人民从去年11月议会选举以来内心的变化，表明共产党的影响在加强，人民对共产党的信任在提高。
    杜克洛在分析市政选举结果时着重指出，共产党的胜利以及民主力量和共和力量在同反动派斗争中日益扩大的团结，具有重大政治意义。他说，选举结果表明，反动派企图夺取共产党人、社会党人和共和人士所领导的那些市政委员会的阴谋已经遭到失败。
    杜克洛接着说，共产党就它所获得的票数来讲居第一位，占总票数的29.1％。比1953年所获票数还增加了三十万张。法国共产党所获得的重大胜利——加强了它作为法国第一大党的地位。
    杜克洛说，选举结果甚至超出了最乐观的预计，它明显暴露了独裁统治同人民意志之间日益加深的矛盾。保卫新共和联盟和其他执政党遭到了失败。
    杜克洛报告中的很大一部分分析了法国社会党的立场，阐述了社会党和共产党一致行动的问题。
    杜克洛说，社会党领导极力阻挠社会党人和共产党人结成联盟，而促使社会党人同包括保卫新共和联盟在内的各反动党派结成联盟。
    杜克洛接着说，然而，社会党党内的情况现在已经发生了变化。一部分社会党人参加了反动派的联合名单，另一部分人则同共产党人和其他共和人士结成了联盟。
    杜克洛强调说，许多社会党人不顾社会党领导的反对，毫不犹疑地同共产党人联合起来并投共产党人的票，这个事实具有非常重大的意义。
    杜克洛说，最近以来，关于工人和民主力量必须结成联盟的主张已经更加广泛地深入到劳动人民和民主人士的思想中去。他强调指出，共产党人不仅应当保持，而且应当加强同社会党人已经建立起来的接触。
    杜克洛接着谈到了共产党的任务。他说，人民群众不满政府的政策已在市政选举期间在政治方面表现出来。但是，这种不满只是不倦地争取行动一致的开端。
    杜克洛强调指出，对全体党员来说，最重要和最迫切的问题是开展维护劳动群众利益的斗争。他指出，最近，劳动人民为满足自身经济要求而开展的斗争，规模正越来越大。他说，这个日益高涨的斗争的特征在于各行各业工会的行动一致。
    杜克洛指出，现政府的经济和财政政策遭到法国工人阶级和人民群众的反对；这些政策同继续阿尔及利亚战争有密切关系。杜克洛强调指出，应当在殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动面前说明戴高乐政策的不折不扣的殖民主义性质。
    杜克洛接着谈到了欧洲局势，特别是德国和柏林的局势。他指出苏联关于对德和约和柏林问题的建议的重大意义，并且严厉谴责了法国政府的政策。他指出，法国政府不致力于缓和国际紧张局势，反而把自己的命运同西德军国主义者联系在一起。它还顽固地拒绝承认德意志民主共和国。圣多昂的居民欢呼共产党在市政选举中获得很大胜利的情形。
