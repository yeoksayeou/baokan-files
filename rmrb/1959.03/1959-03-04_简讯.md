	Magnesite Support Replaces Pit Props
	Benxi Coal Mine has successfully experimented with using magnesite supports to replace pit props. A single magnesite support can bear a load of up to six tons. Its compressive strength is second only to red pine, and its cost is low and easy to use. Promoting its use can save a large amount of pit props.

	Single-Shaft Coke Crusher
	Chen Yan枢, a veteran technician at the Gejiu Ore Dressing Plant Repair Shop, used old materials to make a single-shaft coke crusher.
	This coke crusher can crush more than 15 tons of coke per hour, and the loss rate of coke is only about 7%.
	In the past, the factory used manual crushing, and each person could only crush more than 300 kilograms of coke per day, and the loss rate averaged as high as 15%.

	Largest Domestically Produced Universal Milling Machine
	China's first and largest X250 gantry type universal milling machine was successfully trial-produced at Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.
	The gantry milling machine uses the method of processing with the workpiece stationary and the tool moving. The width of the workpiece it processes is five meters, and the length is unlimited, because this machine tool can be extended with guide rails at will. The weight of the machine tool is only more than 70 tons, which is about one-tenth of the weight of similar models in the world. At the same time, the head can be replaced to perform various processing such as grinding, drilling, and boring.

	Hollow Copper Wire
	A new material to promote rapid growth of electricity and manufacture power generation equipment - hollow copper wire - was manufactured at Shenyang Cable Factory. It not only replaces the copper flat wire on general power generation equipment, but also enables a generator with the same capacity to generate three times more electricity; and can save a lot of materials.
	This hollow copper wire is suitable for various DC generators, AC generators, steam turbines and transformers.

    菱苦土支架代坑木
    本溪煤矿试验用菱苦土支架代替坑木成功。菱苦土支架一根负荷达六吨重，它的抗压强度仅次于红松，成本也低，使用方便，推行以后可以节约大量坑木。
    单轴碎焦机
    个旧选矿厂修配所老技工陈炎枢，利用旧料制成一部单轴碎焦机。
    这部碎焦机每小时能碎焦炭十五吨多，焦炭的损耗率只有7％左右。
    这个厂过去用人工破碎，每人每天只能碎焦炭三百多公斤，而且损耗率平均高达15％。
    国产最大的万能铣床
    我国第一台最大的X250天桥式万能铣床在齐齐哈尔第一机床厂试制成功。
    天桥式铣床是采取工作物不动、刀具动的方式加工。它所加工的工作物的宽度为五公尺，长度不受限制，因为这种机床可以任意接长导轨。机床重量只有七十多吨，约相当于世界上类似型号机床重量的十分之一。同时还可以改换床头，进行磨、钻、镗等多种加工。
    空心铜导线
    一种促进电力迅速增长，制造发电设备的新材料——空心铜导线在沈阳电缆厂制成。它不仅代替了一般发电设备上的铜扁线，而且可使同样容量的发电机，发出比它大三倍的电量来；并能节约大量的材料。
    这种空心铜导线适用于各种直流发电机、交流发电机、汽轮机和变压器上。
