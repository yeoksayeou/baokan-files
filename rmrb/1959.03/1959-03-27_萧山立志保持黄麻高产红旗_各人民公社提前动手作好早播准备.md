    Xiaoshan Resolves to Maintain the Red Flag of High Jute Yields
    People's Communes Take Early Action to Prepare for Early Planting
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th) Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, known throughout the country for its high jute yields, has set a leap forward target for this year: to increase the average yield of its 200,000 mu of jute from 935 jin per mu last year to 1,500 jin per mu. Based on the experience that early planting can increase production, farmers throughout the county have made preparations for early planting this year. Some experimental fields have already begun sowing, and full-scale planting is expected to begin from the end of March to the beginning of April.
    In order to maintain the national red flag for high jute yields, the enthusiasm of the people's communes throughout the county is even greater this year, and the measures are better. In addition to seizing the agricultural season to implement early planting, extending the growing period of the jute to increase yield (last year, two identical jute fields, one with a growing period of 182 days yielded 1,870 jin per mu; the other with a growing period of 150 days yielded only 645 jin per mu), the land will be deeply plowed to a depth of 9 to 10 inches (last year it was 8 inches), 90% of the jute fields will use improved varieties, and dense planting will be promoted, increasing from an average of 30,000 plants per mu last year to 40,000 to 45,000 plants per mu. In addition, the four-purpose seeder will be vigorously promoted to replace manual sowing. Using this new tool for sowing not only ensures appropriate depth and uniform row spacing, but also increases efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual labor.

    萧山立志保持黄麻高产红旗
    各人民公社提前动手作好早播准备
    本报杭州26日电　以黄麻高产闻名全国的浙江省萧山县，今年提出了全县二十万亩黄麻要由去年平均亩产九百三十五斤提高到一千五百斤的跃进指标。全县农民根据往年早播能增产的经验，今年已作好了早播的准备。有的试验田已开始播种，3月底到4月上旬播种即可全面展开。
    为了保持全国黄麻高产的红旗，今年全县各人民公社的干劲更高，措施更好。除了抓紧农时实行早播，使麻的生长期延长，以增加产量外（去年同样两块麻田，生长一百八十二天的亩产一千八百七十斤；另一块生长一百五十天的亩产只六百四十五斤），土地要深翻九寸到一尺（去年为八寸），90％的麻田选用良种，推广密植，由去年平均每亩三万株增加到四万至四万五千株。此外，还要大力推广四用播种机代替用手播种。使用这种新工具播种，不仅深浅合适，行距均匀，而且效率比人工快十倍以上。
