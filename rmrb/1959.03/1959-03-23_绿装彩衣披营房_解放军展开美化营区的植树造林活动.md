Xinhua News Agency, March 21st – Since the beginning of spring, various units of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically launched a tree-planting and afforestation campaign focusing on greening and beautifying the barracks, determined to transform the camps into gardens where "fruit trees grow into forests, hundreds of flowers bloom, and green attire and colorful garments adorn the barracks." To date, the troops in the Zhanjiang area have planted more than 420,000 trees, including more than 19,000 fruit trees such as oranges and lychees. A certain unit of the Fuzhou Garrison planted more than 890,000 saplings of various kinds and sowed more than 10,000 jin of oil tea seeds, totaling more than 3,900 mu, in just a few days. A certain unit of the Nanjing Troops is planting more than 100,000 saplings that have been prepared. The garrisons in Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places have not only planted a large number of saplings, but have also begun planting flowers and building gardens. A certain unit of the Guangzhou Troops planted more than 40,000 fruit trees and built 52 gardens of various sizes, as well as hundreds of flower beds and flower plots, in 20 days.

All units have set up special tree planting headquarters and technical guidance groups to lead the tree planting and flower planting activities. The vast number of officers and soldiers are very enthusiastic. The retiring veterans are busy planting commemorative trees and friendship trees to leave a memory for the new soldiers. The newly enlisted soldiers also enthusiastically participate in the greening work. A certain unit of the Fuzhou Garrison braved the rain to plant trees on the mountain during the Spring Festival, and the rain and sweat soaked their clothes. Some soldiers wrote poems singing: "Fighting bravely in the mountains in the rain, every drop of sweat shows strength, today the seedlings are planted well, the country's construction has enough timber, and our faces are radiant."

In order to make the greening and beautification of the barracks more planned, many troops have formulated plans to realize the landscaping of the barracks in a few years. Recently, a telephone conference held by the Guangzhou Troops called for consolidating the existing trees on the basis of last year's greening work, vigorously planting fruit trees, and building parks with green, fruit, flowers, and fragrance in each barracks. A certain unit of the Nanjing Troops also requires all units to plant tall and easy-to-grow trees such as poplars and phoenix trees near the barracks, along the roads, and around the training grounds, interspersed with wintersweet, peach, plum, and other flowers and trees for winter and spring viewing. Troops with suitable conditions should also dig ponds, plant lotus flowers and water hyacinths, and raise fish.

    解放军展开美化营区的植树造林活动
    新华社21日讯　入春以来，人民解放军各部队热烈展开以绿化美化营区为重点的植树造林活动，决心把营区变成“果木成林百花香，绿装彩衣披营房”的花园。到目前止，湛江地区部队已经植树四十二万多株，其中柑橘、荔枝等果树一万九千多株。福州驻军某部几天内栽各种树苗八十九万多棵，种油茶籽一万多斤，计三千九百多亩。南京部队某部准备好的十多万棵树苗正在栽植。武汉、广州等地驻军除了种植大量树苗以外，还开始了种植花卉和修造花园的活动。广州部队某部在二十天内就种了果树四万多株，修成大小花园五十二个，花坛、花地数百个。
    各部队都专门设立植树指挥部和技术指导组，领导植树种花活动。广大官兵干劲很大。将退伍的老兵为了给新战士留个纪念，都在忙着种纪念树、友谊树。才入伍的新战士也热情地参加绿化工作。福州驻军某部春节期间冒雨上山植树，雨水合着汗水湿透了衣衫。有的战士写诗歌唱道：“冒雨奋战在山岗，滴滴汗水显力量，今天幼苗栽得好，祖国建设木材足，我们脸上添红光。”
    为了使绿化和美化营区工作更加有计划地进行，许多部队都制订了几年实现营区园林化的规划。最近，广州部队召开的电话会议，要求在去年绿化工作的基础上整顿现有树木，大力种植果树，并在各营区修建绿、果、花、香俱备的公园。南京部队某部也要求各单位在营房附近、道路两旁、操场周围，大种白杨、梧桐等高大而且易于生长的树木，夹种腊梅、桃李和其它供冬春观赏的花卉和树木。有条件的部队还要挖水塘，种荷花、水浮莲和养鱼。
