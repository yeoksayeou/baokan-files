    Correctly Understand Seeking Truth From Facts

    Some people lack a supportive attitude towards those technological innovators who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and possess a spirit of innovation. Some even claim to have "foresight" when these technological innovators encounter setbacks and difficulties, saying things like: "I knew it all along, you aren't being realistic!"

    Yes, we do not approve of people's unfounded fantasies, but we cannot assume that "seeking truth from facts" means finding the "truth" all at once and "seeking" it with 100% accuracy. Similarly, we cannot assume that technological creation and invention must be successful at once, without any setbacks or failures. Because this is not in line with the objective laws of the development of things.

    In fact, "truth" must be found from thousands upon thousands of "non-truths" or "near-truths that are actually non-truths," so in the process of "seeking truth," it is inevitable that sometimes "non-truths" are taken as "truths," or "near-truths" are taken as "complete truths," thus suffering setbacks and failures of varying degrees. If one grasps all the "truths" at the beginning of everything, then why bother to "seek" or experiment? Moreover, every setback and failure has moved those brave "seekers of truth from facts" one step closer to the road to success, overcoming a difficulty, solving a problem, moving forward one step, and finally achieving victory. This is not only because they have drive, but also because they finally achieved victory because they have the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

    We should understand that scientific creations will not be automatically delivered into people's hands, and "truth" will never come without "seeking." People's understanding of a matter always needs to be improved step by step on the basis of existing knowledge, and correct understanding always comes from correcting erroneous understanding. Being afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, and not daring to do things that predecessors have never done, only daring to base oneself on or even below the level that others have already reached, not daring to cross the forbidden zone, and not daring to take a further step on the basis of what predecessors have already achieved, will obviously only lag behind the development of the situation forever, and thus cannot be said to have a scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. Therefore, we must never abandon the pioneering spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act because we emphasize the scientific spirit of "seeking truth from facts." Therefore, for the technological creations and inventions of the broad masses, as long as they are based on something rather than nothing, then even if there are shortcomings and the basis is insufficient, we should actively support their experiments, distinguishing between the important and the urgent.

    The same reasoning applies that any work is bound to produce this or that kind of shortcoming on the road to progress, which is also the objective law of the development of things. As long as the mainstream is progress, then these shortcomings are only a problem of one or even half a finger out of ten fingers. If one sees some shortcomings on the road to progress and shouts that our work is not seeking truth from facts, it is precisely oneself who is violating the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. Because this kind of exaggeration of a problem of one finger or even less than half a finger is not in accordance with the facts, and to demand that no shortcomings should arise on the road to progress is not in accordance with the objective laws of the development of things.

### 正确理解实事求是

    正确理解实事求是
    有些人对于那些敢想、敢说，敢做的富有首创精神的技术革新者，缺乏一种支持的态度，甚至有些人一遇到这些技术革新者受到挫折和碰到困难的时候，就要表示自己有“先见之明”，说什么：“我早就知道了，你们这不是实事求是嘛！”
    是的，我们不赞成人们无根据地胡思乱想，可是，我们不能设想：“实事求是”非得一下子把“是”求出来，而且还要“求”得百分之百的正确。同样不能设想技术上的创造和发明也必须一下子就创造成功，不允许有任何挫折和失败。因为这是不符合事物发展的客观规律的。
    实际上，“是”要从千千万万的“非”或者“近是而实非”的当中找出来，因此在“求是”的过程中就免不了有时把“非”当作“是”，或者把“近是”当作“全是”，从而遭受到大大小小的挫折和失败。如果凡事在一开始就把“是”全部掌握了，那又何必去“求”，何必还要去试验呢？况且，每一次的挫折和失败都使那些勇敢的“实事求是”的人们向成功的道路上前进了一步，克服了一个困难，解决了一个问题，前进了一步，终于取得了胜利。这不仅是因为他们有干劲，而且也因为他们有实事求是的精神才终于取得了胜利的。
    我们应当懂得：科学上的创造是不会自动的送到人们的手里来的，“是”也决非不“求”自至的。人们对于一件事情的认识总是要从已有认识的基础上再一步一步地提高起来，正确的认识总是从改正错误的认识中得来的。前怕狼，后怕虎，根本不敢做那些前人所未做过的事业，只敢把立足点放在别人已经达到的水平线上甚至水平线下，不敢越雷池一步，不敢在前人已经达到的基础上再进一步，显然就只能永远落后于形势的发展，从而也就根本谈不上是什么实事求是的科学精神。因此，我们决不能因为讲究“实事求是”的科学精神就把敢想、敢说、敢做的首创精神丢掉了。因此，我们对于广大的群众的技术上创造和发明的创议，只要有所根据而不是毫无根据，那末，尽管还有缺点，还嫌根据不足，都应该分别轻重缓急积极支持其试验。
    同样的道理，任何工作在前进的道路上总不免会产生这样或那样的缺点，这也是事物发展的客观规律。只要主流是前进的，那这些缺点就只不过是十个指头中的一个甚至半个指头还不到的问题。如果一看到前进道路上产生了某些缺点，就大叫我们的工作不是实事求是的，其实正是自己违反了实事求是的科学精神。因为这种把一个指头甚至不到半个指头的问题夸大化，是不符合事实的，而要求在前进的道路上不会产生任何缺点，又是不符合事物发展的客观规律的。
