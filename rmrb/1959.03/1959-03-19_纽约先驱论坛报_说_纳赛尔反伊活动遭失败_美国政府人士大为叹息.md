Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch from New York: The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Joseph Alsop on the 17th, saying that core figures in the U.S. government were "greatly displeased" with Nasser's failure in Iraq.

Alsop said that Nasser made a "final, quite risky gamble" to overthrow the Qasim government in Iraq, but suffered a serious defeat. The article said that in the past, "any major failure of Nasser's made the vast majority of American policymakers happy," "however, today, due to Nasser's serious failure in Iraq, core figures in the (American) government are greatly displeased."

Alsop revealed in this article that the main reason for Washington's displeasure is: because the Iraqi people "coped with and defeated" this military rebellion, the "long-cherished hope" of Western imperialists to re-enslave the Iraqi people has now "faded to complete disillusionment."

    “纽约先驱论坛报”说
    纳赛尔反伊活动遭失败  美国政府人士大为叹息
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”17日刊登的约瑟夫·艾尔索普写的一篇文章说，美国政府核心人士对纳赛尔在伊拉克遭到的失败“大为不快”。
    艾尔索普说，纳赛尔在推翻伊拉克卡塞姆政府方面作了“最后的、相当冒险的赌博”，但是遭到了严重失败。文章说，过去“纳赛尔的任何重大失败都使绝大多数美国决策者感到高兴”，“然而今天，由于纳赛尔在伊拉克遭到严重失败，（美国）政府核心人士就大为不快”。
    艾尔索普在这篇文章中透露，华盛顿方面感到不快的主要原因是：由于伊拉克人民“应付了并且打败了”这次军事叛乱，西方帝国主义者妄想重新奴役伊拉克人民的“长期怀抱的希望现在已经黯淡到完全幻灭的程度”。
