Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st – Taiyuan City held a 1959 Great Leap Forward Swearing-in Conference on February 27th. More than 3,500 representatives from various fronts, including industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, and health, unanimously stated at the meeting that they would fight a great battle in March with even greater enthusiasm to ensure the realization of the 1959 targets. Li Qi, First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He called on leading cadres of all enterprises in the city to immediately go deep among the masses of workers and staff to vigorously carry out technological innovation, and called on the vast number of workers and staff to contribute ideas and innovate, striving to double the city's industrial production.

Subsequently, representatives from various fronts took the stage to express their determination. Chen Langhuan, manager of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, representing all employees of the company, proposed to strive to double the output of major products such as iron, steel, steel materials, metallurgical coke, and refractory bricks this year, and strive to achieve the first place in the country in various technical and economic indicators. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces must exceed Benxi's, to win the national red flag. The workers and staff of the Xishan Mining Bureau, who have consistently overfulfilled the national plan for twenty-six consecutive months, under the slogan of overwhelming enthusiasm, exhaustive measures, racing against time, and exceeding targets, will strive to produce 6.3 million tons of coal throughout the year, and double the output value of coke compared to last year. The chairman of the Taiyuan Railway Administration Trade Union stated at the meeting that they would guarantee to better shoulder the important responsibility of the pioneer this year, ensuring that how much is produced is transported, how much is needed is pulled, and how much is available is unloaded, seizing every second and not pressing down on every ounce.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 1st – The four-day Benxi City Industrial and Mining Enterprise High-Yield Red Flag Celebration and Competition Conference successfully concluded on February 28th. More than 1,600 representatives of workers and staff, advanced figures, and responsible enterprise cadres vowed at the conference to launch an even greater production leap forward this year. On the basis of planting national and provincial red flags in electric furnace steelmaking, blast furnace ironmaking, mining, ore dressing, transportation, and other aspects last year, they will raise the red flags higher and plant more of them. Ren Zhiyuan, First Secretary of the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the meeting that Benxi is an important base for the production of coking coal and steel products in the country, and ensuring the overfulfillment of the annual Great Leap Forward plan is of great significance to national production and construction. He called on all workers and staff in the city on behalf of the municipal party committee to take active action, boost even greater enthusiasm, vigorously promote technical measures, demand steel from time, seize every second, not yield an inch, and launch an even greater production upsurge, completing the production Great Leap Forward plan on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis.

During the conference, representatives from nineteen systems including steel, iron, coal, coke, mines, refractory materials, and transportation, used the method of mutual linking and self-selection to launch red flag competitions between similar units. Representatives from more than sixty units took the stage to compete, launching a red flag competition upsurge of planting red flags, protecting red flags, and guaranteeing the completion of the leap forward plan. Representatives from Benxi Steel Plant, which won the national electric furnace steelmaking championship in the fourth quarter of last year, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which has maintained the national ironmaking red flag for ten consecutive months, and other steelmaking units in Benxi put forward their own competition conditions and challenged brother ironmaking plants in various places.

Representatives from several coal mines that produce a large amount of coking coal also competed very enthusiastically. Chen Guangjin, the representative of Benxi Coal Mine, which completed the February production plan more than two days ahead of schedule, proposed a friendly competition on behalf of all the workers and staff of the mine to Benxi Caitun, Fushun Laohutai, Fuxin Ping'an, and Beipiao Taiji coal mines. Their conditions are to guarantee to produce more than 53,900 tons of raw coal more than the original plan in the first quarter and complete the annual tunneling plan twenty days ahead of schedule.
