Xinhua News Agency, March 21st - Over eight hundred musicians and music lovers in the capital commemorated the 120th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian composer Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky this evening.

At the meeting, Xiang Yu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Musicians Association, delivered a report on Mussorgsky's life and achievements in his musical career. The report pointed out that from the very beginning of his artistic creation, Mussorgsky demonstrated a strong realistic tendency, and later became an advanced fighter who strived for realistic art throughout his life. His works are full of revolutionary democratic spirit. At the same time, he used vivid musical language to express the pain and joy of the Russian people and created perfect artistic images. In the history of Russian classical music, Mussorgsky was the first composer to portray the people and their struggles. Xiang Yu said: Today, we commemorate Mussorgsky not only because of our respect for this realistic composer who loved the people, but also because our musicians have a high enthusiasm for studying Russian classical music and Soviet music.

The commemoration was jointly organized by the Chinese Musicians Association, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and was presided over by Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters. Diplomatic officials from the Soviet Embassy in China also attended the commemoration. After the meeting, teachers and students from the Central Conservatory of Music performed Mussorgsky's works and screened the Soviet film "Mussorgsky."

    新华社21日讯　首都音乐家和音乐爱好者八百余人，今晚为俄罗斯伟大作曲家莫·彼·穆索尔斯基诞生一百二十周年举行纪念会。
    会上，中国音乐家协会书记处书记向隅作了关于穆索尔斯基生平和音乐事业上的成就的报告。报告中指出穆索尔斯基一开始跨入艺术创作的领域，就表现了强烈的现实主义倾向，而后成为毕生为现实主义艺术而奋斗的先进战士。他的作品中充满了革命民主主义精神，同时他以生动的音乐语言，表现了俄罗斯人民的痛苦和欢乐，并且创造了完美的艺术形象。在俄罗斯古典音乐史上，穆索尔斯基是第一个表现了人民和人民的斗争的作曲家。向隅说：今天我们纪念穆索尔斯基，不仅由于我们对这位热爱人民的现实主义作曲家的尊敬，而且还因为我国音乐工作者对于俄罗斯古典音乐和苏联音乐怀着很高的学习热情。
    纪念会是中国音乐家协会、中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友好协会三个单位联合举办的，由中苏友好协会总会副秘书长戈宝权主持。苏联驻华大使馆外交官员也出席了这个纪念会。会后，中央音乐学院师生演奏了穆索尔斯基的作品，并放映了苏联电影“穆索尔斯基”。
