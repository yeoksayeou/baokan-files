Xinhua News Agency, Washington: A delegation of more than one hundred Indians held a demonstration in front of the White House on the 19th, lasting for several hours, protesting the cruel rule and discriminatory policies of the U.S. government against the Indians.

These Indian representatives arrived in Washington on the 18th. A leader of an Indian tribe told reporters that they would hand over to Eisenhower a "long and shameful list" of the U.S. authorities' violations of the treaties it signed with the Indian tribes. This leader said that the Indians were deprived of all political rights.

There are currently about 400,000 Indians in the United States. They are confined to barren "special reservations," and some are even fenced in with barbed wire like animals in so-called "Indian villages," and cannot leave without permission.

Recently, the "Newsday" published in Yorktown, reported on the tragic situation of the Indians, saying, "The Indians are an oppressed colonial people living within our country."

"Newsday" cited facts to prove that the mortality rate from pneumonia and influenza among Indians is almost four times that of Americans, and the number of people suffering from tuberculosis is five times that of Americans.

The newspaper pointed out that the infant mortality rate among Indians is very high. In the Papago and Navajo Indian reservations, the infant mortality rate under one year old is 50%. The newspaper said that according to Senator Langer's statistics, the average life expectancy of American Indians is only seventeen years old. (Attached picture)

### 抗议美当局的残酷统治  印第安人在白宫前示威

    抗议美当局的残酷统治
    印第安人在白宫前示威
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：一个由一百多名印第安人组成的代表团19日在白宫前面举行了历时数小时的示威游行，抗议美国政府对印第安人的残酷的统治和歧视政策。
    这些印第安人的代表是在18日到达华盛顿的。一个印第安人部落的领袖告诉记者们说，他们将要交给艾森豪威尔一张关于美国当局破坏它同印第安各部落签订的条约的“长长的可耻的清单”。这个领袖说，印第安人被剥夺了一切政治权利。
    美国目前大约有四十万印第安人。他们被限制在荒芜的“特别居留地”中，有些甚至被像动物一样地用铁丝网圈在所谓“印第安人村”里，没有得到允许就不能离开。
    最近约克城出版的“新闻日报”在报道关于印第安人所处的悲惨境地时说，“印第安人是生活在我国境内的受压迫的殖民地人民”。
      “新闻日报”举出事实证明，印第安人患肺炎和流行性感冒的死亡率差不多为美国人的四倍，而患肺结核病的人为美国人的五倍。
    这家报纸指出印第安人的儿童死亡率很高。在帕帕哥和纳瓦霍印第安人居住区，不满一岁的儿童死亡率为50％。报纸说，据参议员朗格统计，美国印第安人的平均寿命只有十七岁。（附图片）
    美国印第安人：算了吧，你说的这一套，我在美国就没见过！
