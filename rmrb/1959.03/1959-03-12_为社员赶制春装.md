    Rushing to Make Spring Clothing for Commune Members
    More than one hundred sewing factories in the Huashaoying People's Commune in Wei County, Hebei Province, are working day and night to rush-produce single-layer and lined garments, ensuring that commune members can change into spring clothing on time during the busy spring plowing season.
    From the Spring Festival to February 20th, in just over half a month, they have already produced 1,770 single-layer and lined garments, disassembled, washed, and repaired 771 quilts and pieces of clothing, and made 532 pairs of single shoes.
