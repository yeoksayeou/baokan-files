    Mongolian "Truth Daily" Points Out
    Foreign Forces Planned Shawwaf Rebellion
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 19th – The Mongolian "Truth Daily" pointed out today in a commentary entitled "Iraq Defends Revolutionary Achievements" that the rebellion of Shawwaf in Iraq was planned by foreign aggressive forces who oppose Iraq. They are unwilling to see Iraq embark on the road of independence and democracy and are trying every possible means to undermine it. People all over the world are happy for the new victory of the Iraqi people in quelling the rebellion.
    The commentary said that imperialism not only wants to stifle the revolutionary achievements of the Iraqi people, but also tries every possible means to undermine the unity of the Arab peoples. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the unity of the Arab countries and then devour these countries one by one. Therefore, some actions from the United Arab Republic that may cause damage to the unity of the Arabs not only make the Arabs uneasy, but also make the people of Asian countries who oppose imperialism uneasy. The more consolidated the unity of the Arab countries, the more timely they can expose and smash every conspiracy of imperialism.
    The commentary concluded that the Mongolian people, together with the people of all countries in the world, fully support the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people, and we fully stand on the side of the just cause of the Iraqi people and the Arab people.

    蒙古“真理报”指出
    外国势力策划沙瓦夫叛乱
    新华社乌兰巴托19日电　蒙古“真理报”今天在题为“伊拉克保卫着革命成果”的评论中指出，伊拉克沙瓦夫的叛乱是那些反对伊拉克的外国侵略势力所策划的，它们不愿看到伊拉克走上独立民主的道路，千方百计要搞垮它。全世界人民为伊拉克人民扑灭叛乱的新胜利而感到高兴。
    评论说，帝国主义不仅想扼杀伊拉克人民的革命成果，同时还千方百计地企图破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结，它们最终的目的是要在破坏阿拉伯各国的团结以后，一个个地吃掉这些国家。因此，来自阿拉伯联合共和国方面的某些会对阿拉伯人的团结造成损失的举动，就不仅使阿拉伯人、而且也使亚洲各国反对帝国主义的人们感到不安。阿拉伯各国的团结愈是巩固，就愈能及时揭露和粉碎帝国主义的每一个阴谋。
    评论最后说，蒙古人民同世界各国人民一道，完全支持伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，我们完全站在伊拉克人民和阿拉伯人民正义事业的一边。
