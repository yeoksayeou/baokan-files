Implement the National Overall Planning Policy to Ensure Key Construction Projects
The whole country supports Wuhan Steel, Wuhan Steel supports the whole country

(Reported by our newspaper) Following the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," factories and mines across the country continue to promote the spirit of supporting key construction projects, actively aiding Wuhan Steel's greater leap forward in terms of manpower and resources.

Equipment arrives at Wuhan Steel from all over the country almost every day. According to statistics, eighty-nine major manufacturing plants in eighteen provinces are working to produce various equipment for Wuhan Steel. Equipment needed for the engineering projects that Wuhan Steel plans to complete or install in the first quarter has either already been delivered or is being shipped. The main equipment for Wuhan Steel's sintering plant—Nos. 1 and 2 sintering machines—was fully delivered by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory in the fourth quarter of last year. The door frames and protection plates for the No. 3 coke oven were fully supported and processed by Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, and all orders were delivered in January of this year. During the transportation of this equipment, strong support and assistance were also received from railway bureaus, port authorities, and the Changjiang Shipping Bureau in various locations. Many units regard ensuring the completion of Wuhan Steel's orders on time or ahead of schedule and vigorously supporting key construction projects as practical actions to implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

In the first quarter of this year, one hundred factories and mines in nineteen provinces supported Wuhan Steel with tens of thousands of types of fuel and construction materials for production. In the first quarter, Wuhan Steel needed 500,000 tons of coking coal and 50,000 tons of power coal, which were guaranteed by eleven mines in eight provinces. The local mining bureaus and coal bureaus seized the support work for Wuhan Steel in January, and more than 34,000 tons of coal were sent out before the new contract was signed. In order to meet Wuhan Steel's production needs this year, various places across the country also supported a large number of raw materials such as iron ore powder, silica, manganese ore, fluorite, ferrosilicon, and high-lead soil.

Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) played the great power of the old iron and steel base and continued to vigorously support Wuhan Steel. Of the more than 15,000 tons of steel allocated by the state in the first quarter, Ansteel was responsible for supplying 70%, including steel rails, steel plates, steel bars, channel steel, and angle steel. The first batch of more than 300 tons of steel plates arrived in January. In addition, twenty-seven steel plants in Daye, Chongqing, Fushun and other places also supported Wuhan Steel with various steel products. Other building materials such as cement, stone, sand, lime, and red bricks were in great demand, and all regions vigorously supported them in the spirit of giving priority to key construction projects.

While vigorously supporting Wuhan Steel with equipment and various materials, various places also sent a large number of laborers to Wuhan Steel. Since the second half of last year, Hubei, Hunan, and Henan provinces have supported more than 39,000 new workers, greatly strengthening the production and construction teams. Ansteel, Daye Steel Plant and other units also trained workers for Wuhan Steel.

While the whole country is supporting the large-scale construction of Wuhan Steel, Wuhan Steel has also begun to use the great power of its backbone industry to support the whole country.

Since the fall of last year, Wuhan Steel has successively built and put into production No. 1 blast furnace and Nos. 1 and 2 coke ovens. Because these furnaces not only have high output but also good quality, since they were put into production, they have produced hundreds of thousands of tons of good iron and coke. In addition to a part of self-use, most of these products have supported various parts of the country and various factories and mines. According to incomplete statistics, more than 100 factories in nineteen provinces and cities including Shandong, Sichuan, and Shanghai have received support from Wuhan Steel. Wuhan Steel manufactured nearly a thousand small metallurgical equipment and other equipment last year. In addition to arming itself, it supported other factories and mines.

In recent years, Wuhan Steel has supported the steel industry in various places with its enormous technical strength. In the past year, Wuhan Steel has trained more than 5,000 workers and technicians for eighty-five units in seventeen provinces across the country, and supported more than 6,000 workers and more than 1,700 technicians and cadres in Hubei Province, Wuhan City, Baotou Iron and Steel Company and other units. This year, Wuhan Steel will make greater contributions to socialist construction. In 1959, in addition to No. 1 blast furnace and Nos. 1 and 2 coke ovens, Wuhan Steel will also have two blast furnaces, three coke ovens, five large open-hearth furnaces and a series of steel rolling mills put into production, and this year's output will increase several to dozens of times compared with last year. With the support of the people of the whole country, the broad masses of workers and staff of Wuhan Steel are accelerating the construction speed and intensifying production with soaring energy, striving to seize 18 million tons of steel.

    贯彻全国一盘棋方针保证重点建设
    全国支援武钢　武钢支援全国
    本报讯　全国各地厂矿根据“全国一盘棋”的原则，继续发挥过去支援重点建设精神，在人力、物力等方面积极支援武钢更大跃进。
    现在，武钢差不多每天都可收到从全国各地运来的成批设备。据统计，全国共有十八个省八十九个主要制造厂正在为武钢赶制各种设备。武钢第一季度要竣工或要进行设备安装的工程项目所需的设备，有的已经交货，有的正在发运。武钢烧结厂的主要设备——一、二号烧结机，沈阳重型机器厂早在去年第四季度就已全部交清。三号焦炉的炉门框、保护板，则由太原重型机器厂全力支援加工，订货在今年1月份已全部交清。这些设备在运输过程中，还得到各地铁路局、港务局、长航局等部门的大力支援和协助。许多单位把保证按期和提前完成武钢订货，大力支援重点建设，作为贯彻党的八届六中全会决议的实际行动。
    今年第一季度内有十九个省一百个厂矿支援武钢上万种生产用的燃料和建筑材料。第一季度武钢需用炼焦煤五十万吨，动力用煤五万吨，由八个省十一个矿保证供应。各地矿务局、煤炭局1月份便抓紧了对武钢的支援工作，新的合同签订以前就发出煤三万四千多吨。为了满足武钢今年生产需要，全国各地还支援了大量的铁矿粉、矽石、锰矿、萤石、矽铁、高铅土等数十种原料。
    鞍钢发挥老钢铁基地的巨大威力，继续大力支援武钢。第一季度国家调拨的一万五千多吨钢材中，鞍钢负责供应的即占70％，其中包括钢轨、钢板、钢筋及槽钢、角钢等，第一批支援的钢板三百多吨已于1月份运到。此外，大冶、重庆、抚顺等地的二十七个钢铁厂也支援了武钢各种钢材。其他如水泥、石料、砂子、石灰、红砖等建筑材料，需用量极大，各地都本着首先保证重点建设的精神，大力加以支援。
    各地在大力支援武钢设备和各种物资的同时，还为武钢输送了大批劳动力。从去年下半年起，湖北、湖南、河南三省共支援了新工人三万九千余名，大大地加强了生产和施工的队伍。鞍钢、大冶钢厂等单位还为武钢培训工人。
    在全国支援武钢大规模建设的同时，武钢也开始以它骨干工业的巨大威力来支援全国了。
    自从去年秋季以来，武钢先后建成并投入生产的有一号高炉和一号、二号焦炉。由于这些炉子不仅产量高而且质量好，自从投入生产到现在，已生产了几十万吨好铁、焦，这些产品除一部分自用外，绝大部分支援了全国各地和各厂矿。据不完全统计，全国已有山东、四川、上海等十九个省市的一百多个工厂得到了武钢的支援。武钢去年自己制造了近千台小型冶金设备和其他设备，除了武装自己以外，都支援了其他厂矿。
    近年来，武钢以巨大的技术力量支援了各地的钢铁工业。去年一年内，武钢为全国十七个省八十五个单位培养了五千多个工人和技术人员，并且支援了湖北省、武汉市、包头钢铁公司等单位六千多名工人，一千七百多名技术人员和干部。今年，武钢在社会主义建设中将作出更大贡献。1959年武钢除了一号高炉，一、二号焦炉外，还将有两座高炉、三座焦炉、五座大平炉和一系列的轧钢厂投入生产，今年的产量将比去年增加几倍到几十倍。武钢的广大职工在全国人民支援下，正以冲天的干劲，加快建设速度和加紧生产，为夺取一千八百万吨钢而奋斗。（附图片）
