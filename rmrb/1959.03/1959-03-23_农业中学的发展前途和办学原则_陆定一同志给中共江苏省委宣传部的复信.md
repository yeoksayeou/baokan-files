Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd, Nanjing: The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published on March 20th a reply letter from Comrade Lu Dingyi to the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC. This letter discusses the development prospects and the guiding principles for running agricultural middle schools well. The full text is as follows:

To the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee:

Your letter of March 7th has been received. At the same time, I received telegrams from Xinhua Daily and Rugao Yonggan Agricultural Middle School, and a letter from the Propaganda Department of the Hai'an County Committee, all asking me to say a few words about agricultural middle schools to commemorate the first anniversary of their establishment. I am now replying to all of them together; please forward this accordingly.

I apologize for the delay in replying due to other matters.

Agricultural middle school is a new form of school that has emerged in China's education cause. Although it has only been established for a year, its benefits are already known to everyone, and I will not say more about them. What I want to talk about is the development prospects of agricultural middle schools.

Currently, the vast majority of agricultural middle schools are, in terms of cultural level, equivalent to junior middle schools, teaching the most basic courses of junior middle school. In terms of technical education, they cultivate junior agricultural technical cadres. In terms of school type, they are half-day schools. In terms of students' age and cultural level, they are graduates of higher primary schools aged thirteen to sixteen or seventeen. Are such schools needed? In my opinion, China will need this kind of school for a considerable period.

Children aged thirteen to sixteen can do some auxiliary labor in the countryside, but they are not yet adults. We, as fathers and elder brothers, should let them read more books. In the future, after the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, they should enter full-time junior middle schools that combine education with labor.

Our full-time junior middle school education is not yet developed enough. There are about 37 million children aged thirteen to sixteen across the country, while full-time junior middle schools, although they have developed greatly, can only accommodate more than 7 million now. Our primary school education has almost been basically universalized, but full-time junior middle schools cannot be developed too quickly. Therefore, we can fully expect that agricultural middle schools will develop greatly while full-time junior middle schools are developing. It is likely that agricultural middle schools will develop to their peak in the next five to ten years.

China's annual steel production has increased greatly, so the process of agricultural mechanization and electrification will also be rapid. It is very likely that agricultural mechanization and electrification can be developed to a considerable scale in the next five to ten years. To use machines and electricity, there must be cadres with modern scientific knowledge. Who will train this large number of junior technical cadres? Agricultural middle schools must assume a large part of the responsibility.

The superstructure must be suitable for the economic base. The rise of culture is based on the rise of the economy. It seems that agricultural mechanization and electrification will greatly save manpower and bring about a rise in culture. Then, when China implements a six-hour working day, there will be an even greater cultural upsurge.

At that time, agricultural middle schools will gradually "disappear," that is, they will be transformed in a planned and step-by-step manner into full-time junior middle schools that combine education with labor. All children aged thirteen to sixteen can receive full-time junior middle school education.

With economic development, senior high school education and higher education in rural areas will also gradually develop. In this long period to come, part-time education will mainly be adopted, because those who receive this education are all full laborers in the countryside. But we must still work hard. We must "strive to basically ensure that all young people and adults in the country who are qualified and willing can receive higher education within about fifteen years." (Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Education).

This prospect depends on our current and future long-term efforts.

The current agricultural middle schools are doing very well. As long as we abide by four principles, we will run agricultural middle schools well. These four principles are:

(1) The cultural courses should be the most basic courses of junior middle school, including politics, Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

(2) The technical courses should aim to cultivate junior agricultural technical cadres. With economic development, courses on agricultural mechanization and electrification and rural industry should be gradually increased. When specifying the technical courses of agricultural middle schools, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and the times.

(3) Adhere to the half-day system. Agricultural middle schools are neither full-time schools nor part-time schools.

(4) In principle, admit graduates of higher primary schools aged thirteen to sixteen, and do not admit too many overage students. This is to avoid excessively occupying rural labor.

Those overage youths who want to study but cannot enter agricultural middle schools should be properly organized to carry out part-time study. Part-time study is very important in rural areas. The Central Committee's Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes stipulates that under normal circumstances, rural commune members should be guaranteed two hours of study per day. This kind of study should be well organized to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy and popularizing part-time education for young and middle-aged people.

Let me take this opportunity to extend warm congratulations to all teachers and students of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu and the whole country.
Salute!
Lu Dingyi

    农业中学的发展前途和办学原则
    陆定一同志给中共江苏省委宣传部的复信
    新华社22日讯　南京新华日报3月20日刊载了陆定一同志给中共江苏省委宣传部的一封复信。这封信谈到了农业中学发展的前途和办好农业中学的原则。全文如下：江苏省委宣传部：
    3月7日来信收到。同时收到了新华日报和如皋勇敢农业中学的来电，海安县委宣传部的来信，都是要我对农业中学说几句话，来纪念农业中学创办一周年的。现在一并答复，请代为转致。
    因为有些别的事情，这封回信耽搁了。很抱歉。
    农业中学是我国教育事业中出现的一种新形式的学校。虽然创办仅一年，它的好处大家已经知道，我不想多说了。我想说的，是农业中学发展的前途。
    现在农业中学的最大多数，就文化程度来说，相当于初级中学，教的文化课程是初中的最基本的课程。就技术教育方面来说，它培养初级的农业技术干部。就学校的类别来说，它是半日制学校。就学生的年龄和文化程度来说，是十三岁到十六七岁的高小毕业生。这样的学校，是不是需要呢？我看，我国将在一个相当长的时期里需要这种学校。
      十三岁到十六岁的孩子，在农村中可以做些辅助劳动，但他们还没有成年。我们做父兄的，应该让他们多读点书。到将来，农业机械化和电气化实现之后，应该让他们进教育与劳动相结合的全日制的初级中学读书。
    我们的全日制的初中教育还不够发达。十三岁到十六岁的孩子，全国约有三千七百多万人，而全日制的初级中学，虽然有了很大发展，现在还只能容纳七百多万人。我国的小学教育已经快要基本普及了，而全日制的初级中学是不能发展得太快的。所以我们完全可以预料，在全日制初级中学发展的同时，农业中学将会有很大的发展。大概今后五年到十年中，农业中学将会发展到最高峰。
    我国钢铁的年产量，有很大的增长，因此，农业机械化电气化的过程也将是很快的。很有可能，在今后五年到十年期间，农业机械化电气化就可以发展到相当大的规模了。用机器，用电，要有具有现代科学知识的干部。谁来培养这大批的初级技术干部？农业中学要担负很大一部分责任。
    上层建筑要适合经济基础。文化的高涨是以经济的高涨为基础的。看来，农业机械化电气化将大大节省人力，带来文化的高涨。然后，等到我国实行六小时工作制的时候，将会出现更大的文化高涨。
    到了那个时候，农业中学将会逐渐“消亡”，就是有领导有步骤地分批地变为教育与劳动相结合的全日制的初级中学。所有十三岁到十六岁的孩子，都可以受到全日制的初中教育。
    随着经济的发展，农村里的高级中学教育和高等教育，也一定会逐步发展起来。在这今后一个很长的时期中，将主要地采取业余教育的方式，因为受这种教育的人，在农村中都是全劳动力。但我们仍须努力，我们要“争取在十五年左右的时间内，基本上做到使全国青年和成年，凡是有条件的和自愿的，都可以受到高等教育。”（中共中央、国务院关于教育工作的指示）
    这个前景，有赖于我们今天的以及今后的长期努力。
    现在的农业中学，办得很有成绩。只要遵守四条原则，我们将把农业中学办好。这四条原则是：
      （一）文化课程应当是初中的最基本的课程，包括政治、语文、数学、理化等。
      （二）技术课程应当是以培养初级的农业技术干部为目标。随着经济的发展，要逐步增加关于农业机械化和电气化的课程，和农村工业的课程。规定农业中学的技术课程的时候，要因地制宜，因时制宜。
      （三）坚持半日制。农业中学既不是全日制的学校，也不是业余学校。
      （四）原则上吸收十三岁到十六岁的高小毕业生，不要过多吸收超龄学生。这样做，是为了不致过多地占用农村劳动力。
    凡是要求学习而又不能进农业中学的超龄青年，应该妥善地组织起来，进行业余学习。业余学习在农村里很重要。中央关于人民公社若干问题的决议，规定在一般情况之下，保证农村社员每天有两小时的学习。应当好好组织这种学习，完成扫除文盲的任务，普及青壮年的业余教育。
    让我趁这个机会，对江苏和全国的农业中学的全体师生，致热烈的祝贺。敬礼
