The cadres in Jiangxi Province are vigorously planting experimental fields, driving the masses to launch a high-yield campaign.

Nanchang, March 25th (from our newspaper) - Currently, more than 50,000 cadres at all levels in Jiangxi Province have participated in planting "experimental fields."

This year, the characteristics of cadres at all levels planting experimental fields in Jiangxi are: more participants, larger experimental field area, wider scope, and integration with the broad masses of commune members and agricultural technicians. In this way, planting experimental fields has developed into a mass high-yield movement. Last year, 3,600 cadres in Anyi County planted experimental fields, totaling 3,800 mu. This year, they summarized the achievements and experiences of planting experimental fields last year, believing that planting experimental fields last year achieved great results, obtaining high yields, and also exercising and improving the cadres. However, the disadvantage was that cadres were engaged in it in isolation, rarely absorbing the surrounding masses to participate, and the experimental field area was small. Therefore, some old farmers said that the cadre's experimental field was "more labor, more fertilizer, less land," no wonder it had high yield. Based on this situation and the requirements for large-scale high yield this year, the county party committee decided to develop the cadre's single experimental field of last year into a mass large-area "100-mu high-yield experimental field" combining the vast number of cadres, commune members, and technical personnel. This decision was supported by the vast number of cadres and commune members. In just a few days, 49 "100-mu high-yield experimental fields" appeared in the county, with a total of more than 5,100 mu of high-yield experimental fields, and 4,900 cadres, commune members, and technical personnel participated. In Yongxiu, Xingzi, Duchang, Hukou and other counties, almost all rural work cadres participated in planting experimental fields. They combined with the vast number of commune members and technical personnel, and will plant 90,000 mu of experimental fields this year. The experimental projects include more than ten kinds of crops such as rice, cotton, sweet potatoes, corn, and peanuts. These experiments are not only carried out on land with good natural conditions, but also on land with poor conditions. At the same time, comparative experimental methods are adopted, such as comparison of sparse and dense planting of grain and cotton, comparison of improved varieties, comparison of deep and shallow cultivation, comparison of fertilization, and comparison of soil improvement, in order to create experience, promote overall development, and promote universal high yield.

Now, cadres at all levels have begun to engage in intense labor in their experimental fields. Transporting and applying fertilizer, plowing and harrowing the land, sowing and cultivating seedlings, since they have learned the skills from planting experimental fields last year, and because the vast number of commune members participate and technical personnel guide this year, everything is done meticulously and professionally. In the cadre experimental fields of Nancheng, Chongren and other counties, more than 80% applied 400 to 600 dan of base fertilizer, and the seedling fields underwent three plows and four harrows or even four plows and nine harrows, truly making the fields as flat as a mirror and the mud as rotten as slurry. In order to save time, cadres in Xingzi, Pengze and other counties have recently been sending fertilizer to the experimental fields in the rain, and the secretaries of the Jiujiang Prefectural Committee are busy deep plowing their cotton experimental fields.

With cadres taking the lead in planting experimental fields, the enthusiasm of the masses has been aroused, and their work has become even more vigorous. After the cadres in Anyi County started the "100-mu high-yield experimental field" combining the three aspects, in many communes, young people started youth high-yield experimental fields, women started women's high-yield experimental fields, and cadres and commune members found their respective objects and fields, forming a "three comparisons" competition upsurge of comparing advanced indicators, comparing reliable measures, and comparing soaring enthusiasm, which strongly promoted the current spring plowing production. Wu Jiali, an old commune member of Tu埠 Commune in Yongxiu County, and his son and grandson jointly cultivated a rice experimental field. He said, "Our three generations must cultivate this experimental field well, surpassing the experimental fields of young men."

    试验田里长干劲
    江西干部大种试验田带动群众开展高额丰产运动
    本报南昌25日电　目前，江西省各级干部已有五万多人参加了种“试验田”。
    今年江西各级干部种试验田的特点是：参加的人多，试验田面积大，方面广，并且与广大社员、农业技术人员结合了起来。这样，种试验田就发展成了一个群众性的高额丰产运动。安义县去年有三千六百名干部种试验田，共种试验田三千八百亩。今年他们总结了去年种试验田的成绩和经验，认为去年种试验田成绩很大，获得了高额产量，同时也锻炼提高了干部。但缺点是干部孤立地搞，很少吸收周围群众参加，而且试验田面积小。因此有些老农说，干部试验田是“劳多、肥多、田少”，怪不得高产。根据这种情况和今年大面积高额丰产的要求，县委决定把去年干部单一的试验田，发展成为广大干部、社员、技术人员三结合的群众性大面积“百亩高产试验畈”。这一决定获得了广大干部和社员的拥护，短短几天，全县就出现了四十九个“百亩高产试验畈”，共有五千一百多亩高产试验田，有四千九百个干部、社员和技术人员参加。永修、星子、都昌、湖口等县，全体农村工作干部几乎全部参加了种试验田，他们与广大社员、技术人员相结合，今年将种植九万亩试验田。试验的项目有水稻、棉花、红薯、玉米、花生等十多种。这些试验，不仅在自然条件好的土地上进行，而且在条件差的土地上试验，同时还采用对比试验的方法，如粮棉稀密植对比、优良品种对比、深浅耕对比、施肥对比、土壤改良对比等，以创造经验，推广全面，促进普遍高产。
    现在，各级干部开始在他们的试验田里进行紧张的劳动。送肥施肥、犁地耙田、播种育秧，由于去年种试验田已学得了本领，又由于今年有广大社员参加和技术人员指导，样样做得细致而内行。南城、崇仁等县的干部试验田，80％以上施了基肥四百到六百担，秧田经过了三犁四耙以至四犁九耙，真是田平如镜，泥烂如浆。为了抢时间，近来星子、彭泽等县的干部在冒雨往试验田送肥，九江地委的书记们忙着深耕他们的棉花试验田。
    干部带头种试验田，群情奋发，干劲更大。安义县干部搞起三结合的“百亩高产试验畈”后，在许多公社，青年搞起了青年高产试验畈，妇女搞起了妇女高产试验畈，干部和社员之间各找各的对象和畈头，形成了比指标先进、比措施可靠、比干劲冲天的“三比”竞赛高潮，有力地推动了当前春耕生产。永修县涂埠公社老社员吴家礼和他的儿子、孙子共同搞了一块水稻试验田，他说：“我祖孙三代一定要种好这块试验田，赛过年轻小伙子的试验田。”
