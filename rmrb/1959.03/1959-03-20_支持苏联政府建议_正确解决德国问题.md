    Yesterday, our government issued a reply to the Soviet government, expressing full support for the Soviet government's proposal in its March 2nd note to our government regarding a peaceful solution to the German question. The Soviet proposal is to convene a top-level meeting attended by the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as Poland and Czechoslovakia, with representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany participating, to discuss the German peace treaty issue and the West Berlin issue. If Western countries are not prepared to participate in such a top-level meeting, then a foreign ministers' meeting involving the aforementioned countries should be convened. Our government's reply to the Soviet government reflects the deep concern of the entire Chinese people for the German situation and their heartfelt support for the Soviet government's sincere efforts to ease international tensions.
    Among the major international issues left unresolved after the war, the German question occupies a particularly important position. Germany was once the source of two world wars. History has proven that the internal situation of Germany and the path of German development largely affect the issue of peace and war in the entire world. The people of all countries, especially the people of European countries, suffered severely from Hitler's aggression during World War II, and they paid a heavy price for the victory of the anti-fascist war. They should enjoy peace and tranquility after the war. But now they cannot help but feel anxious about the development of the situation in West Germany once again. Because, due to the policies pursued by Western countries headed by the United States, West Germany has once again embarked on the path of militarism and revanchism. West Germany's war forces are being revived, and West Germany is now an ambitious figure in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. The reactionary policies of the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism have created and deepened the division of Germany. If West Germany continues to be allowed to move towards militarism and revanchism, the European situation will breed more serious dangers, and world peace and security will face greater threats.
    The Soviet Union made the greatest contribution in the anti-fascist war. After the war, it made the greatest efforts in eliminating German militarism and promoting the peaceful and democratic development of Germany. The Soviet Union resolutely opposes the Western countries' policy of reviving German militarism, and has repeatedly put forward many reasonable proposals and propositions to open up the path for a peaceful solution to the German question. Following the proposal put forward last November regarding making West Berlin a demilitarized free city, the Soviet Union again suggested on January 10th this year that a peace conference be convened by the countries concerned to discuss and conclude a German peace treaty. In the note to the governments of various countries on March 2nd, the Soviet Union reiterated its determination and proposed convening a top-level East-West meeting or a foreign ministers' meeting to discuss these issues. The Soviet Union's continuous efforts stem from its lofty desire for peace and its deep concern for the interests of the German people and the people of the world. The Soviet proposals proceed from the reality of the German situation and the urgency of the situation's needs. They point out a realistic path for a peaceful solution to the German question. The realization of these proposals will create conditions for the peaceful reunification of Germany, eliminate the current tensions existing inside and outside Germany, and eliminate West German militarism, thereby establishing an important foundation for lasting peace in Europe.
    What attitude is adopted towards the Soviet proposal is a test of whether Western countries have the sincerity to seek a peaceful solution to the German question. Due to the strong pressure from the people of the world, Western countries headed by the United States have not dared to completely reject the Soviet proposal. They are now also expressing their willingness to hold negotiations. Eisenhower also expressed his willingness to participate in the top-level meeting in his speech on March 16th. At the same time, however, Eisenhower also talked a lot about his deterrent power and conducting nuclear war. Therefore, how much sincerity the United States has in solving the problem from reality remains to be seen. There are currently many signs that the United States and its followers are still trying to play tricks, obstructing negotiations, delaying the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and insisting on their illegal occupation of West Berlin. Under this circumstance, the people of the world need to make further efforts, expose the imperialists' conspiracies at any time, and continue to fight for a peaceful solution to the German question. If the Western countries brazenly disregard the wishes of the people of various countries and oppose the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the elimination of the abnormal state of West Berlin, then the peace-loving socialist countries, as stated in our government's reply: "will have to find other ways to promote the settlement of the German and West Berlin issues." The reply also pointed out that if imperialism dares to resort to force and infringe upon the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic because of this, then the People's Republic of China will, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, fully support the German Democratic Republic's counterattack against such armed provocations, and the aggressors will surely reap what they sow.
    Peace is indivisible. The Chinese people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also hope that peace in Europe will be guaranteed. We will work tirelessly with the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving people, until the German question is correctly resolved.

### 支持苏联政府建议  正确解决德国问题

    支持苏联政府建议  正确解决德国问题
    昨天，我国政府发表了给苏联政府的复照，对苏联政府在3月2日给我国政府照会中所提出的关于和平解决德国问题的建议，表示完全的支持。苏联的建议就是：召开由苏、美、英、法四国和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的国家领导人出席，并有德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表参加的最高级会议，来讨论对德和约问题和西柏林问题。如果西方国家不准备参加这样的最高级会议，那就召开由上述各国参加的外长会议。我国政府给苏联政府的复照，反映了全体中国人民对于德国局势的深切关怀和对于苏联政府为缓和国际紧张局势的真诚努力的衷心的支持。
    在战后悬而未决的重大国际问题中，德国问题占有特别重要的地位。德国曾经是两次世界大战的策源地。历史已经证明，德国内部的状况和德国发展的道路，在很大程度上对整个世界的和平与战争问题发生影响。世界各国，特别是欧洲各国人民在第二次世界大战中遭受过希特勒侵略的严重灾难，他们为反法西斯战争的胜利付出了重大的代价。他们理应在战后享受和平和安宁。但是现在他们却不能不对西德局势的发展再一次感到焦虑不安。因为，由于以美国为首的西方国家所执行的政策，西德重新走上了军国主义和复仇主义的道路。西德的战争势力正在复活起来，在北大西洋侵略集团中，西德今天已经是野心勃勃的脚色了。以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的反动政策，造成了并且加深了德国的分裂。如果继续纵容西德朝着军国主义和复仇主义的道路走去，欧洲局势就会孕育着更加严重的危险，世界的和平和安全就会面临更大的威胁。
    苏联在反法西斯战争中作了最大的贡献。战后，它在肃清德国军国主义和促进德国的和平民主的发展方面，又尽了最大的努力。苏联坚决反对西方国家复活德国军国主义的政策，并一再提出许多合理的建议和主张，来打开和平解决德国问题的道路。继去年11月提出的关于使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市的建议之后，苏联又在今年1月10日建议，由有关国家召开和会来讨论并缔结对德和约。在3月2日致各国政府的照会中，苏联又重申了自己的决心，并建议召开东西方最高级会议或外长会议来讨论这些问题。苏联这种不断的努力，是出于它崇高的和平愿望和它对德国人民与世界人民利益的深切关怀。苏联的建议是从德国的现实情况和形势需要的迫切性出发的，它们给和平解决德国问题指出了现实的道路。实现这些建议，就能为德国的和平统一创造条件，就能消除目前存在于德国内部和外部的紧张局势，就能消除西德的军国主义，从而为欧洲的持久和平建立重要基础。
    对于苏联建议究竟采取什么态度，这是西方国家有没有诚意谋求和平解决德国问题的考验。由于世界各国人民的强大压力，以美国为首的西方国家已不敢完全拒绝苏联的建议。它们现在也表示愿意举行谈判的姿态，艾森豪威尔在3月16日的演说中，也表示愿意参加最高级会议。但与此同时，艾森豪威尔还大谈其威慑力量和进行核战争，因之，美国究竟有多少诚意从现实出发来解决问题，尚有待于行动。目前有不少迹象显示美国及其追随者仍在企图玩弄各种花样，从中作梗，来阻挠谈判，拖延对德和约的缔结，和坚持它们在西柏林的非法占领地位。在这种情况之下，世界各国人民就需要作进一步的努力，随时揭穿帝国主义的阴谋，为和平解决德国问题而继续斗争。如果西方国家悍然不顾各国人民的愿望，反对缔结对德和约和消除西柏林的不正常状态，那末爱好和平的社会主义各国，正如我国政府的照会中所说的：“就不得不寻找其他办法来促进德国和西柏林问题的解决。”照会并且指出：如果帝国主义竟然因此而企图诉诸武力，侵犯德意志民主共和国的主权，那么中华人民共和国将同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起全力支持德意志民主共和国对于这种武装挑衅的反击，侵略者必将自食其果。
    和平是不可分割的。中国人民不仅关心着亚洲的和平，同时也希望欧洲和平得到保障。我们将同苏联、德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家以及一切爱好和平的人民一起进行不懈的努力，直到德国问题获得正确的解决时为止。
