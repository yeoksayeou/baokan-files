　　Soviet Union's Nine Republics
　　Held Local Soviet Elections
　　This paper's comprehensive reports According to Xinhua News Agency: Nine Soviet republics held elections for their Supreme Soviets and local Soviets of Working People's Deputies on March 1. These republics are: the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. On this day, the cities and villages of the nine republics were filled with a festive atmosphere. The doors of the polling stations opened at six in the morning, and the working people went to cast their votes for the candidates of the Party and the non-Party alliance with excitement and joy.
　　This election campaign was carried out under the banner of strengthening the work of the Soviets, strengthening the ties between the Soviets and the masses, and more broadly attracting workers to participate in the practical work of the Soviets.
　　In order to expand the representation of residents in the Soviets—the organs of state power—the number of representatives to be elected in this election in each republic will be much larger than in previous Soviets. For example, the number of candidates for representatives to the Soviets at all levels in the Russian Federation has increased by 127,624 compared to 1955, reaching approximately one million. The number of representative candidates in Leningrad City and Leningrad Oblast alone is three thousand more than in the past.
　　In this election, many new constituencies have also emerged, especially in the eastern regions, on the construction sites of the Seven-Year Plan projects, and in the reclamation areas.
　　This election campaign is being carried out amid the enormous upsurge in the political and labor enthusiasm of the entire Soviet people for building communism after the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The atmosphere was particularly warm on election day.
　　On the 1st, Moscow was decorated like a holiday, with red flags flying in the streets and slogans such as "March 1st, the whole people participate in the election" visible everywhere. The polling stations set up on the streets were brightly lit. From early morning, people happily came to the polling stations, ready to exercise their rights as citizens. Just as the Kremlin bells rang eight times, thousands of polling stations throughout the city opened their doors simultaneously to welcome voters.
　　According to statistics from the Central Election Commission of the Russian Republic, all voting was completed by six o'clock in the afternoon. Almost all citizens actively and enthusiastically voted. For example, the voter turnout in Moscow was 99.29%, in Ryazan Oblast it was 99.99%, and so on. (Attached picture)

    苏联九个加盟共和国
    举行地方苏维埃选举
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联有九个加盟共和国在3月1日举行共和国最高苏维埃和地方劳动人民代表苏维埃选举。这些加盟共和国是：俄罗斯联邦、白俄罗斯、哈萨克、拉脱维亚、摩尔达维亚、塔吉克、土库曼、乌兹别克和乌克兰。这一天，九个共和国的城市和乡村，到处洋溢着节日的气氛。清晨六时各选举站的门就开了，劳动人民怀着兴奋愉快的心情去投党和非党联盟候选人的票。
    这次选举运动是在加强苏维埃的工作、加强苏维埃同群众的联系、更广泛地吸引劳动者参加到苏维埃的实际工作中去的标志下进行的。
    为了扩大居民在苏维埃——国家权力机构中的代表名额，各加盟共和国的这届选举所要选出的代表，将比历届苏维埃的代表要多得多。例如，俄罗斯联邦各级苏维埃代表候选人的数目比1955年增加了十二万七千六百二十四人，而达到了一百万人左右。仅列宁格勒市和列宁格勒州的代表候选人就比过去多三千人。
    这次选举，各地还出现了许多新的选区，特别是在东部地区，在七年计划工程的工地上，在开荒地区。
    这次选举运动是在苏共第二十一次代表大会以后全体苏联人民建设共产主义的政治和劳动热情巨大高涨的情况下进行的。在选举这一天，人们的情绪尤其热烈。
    1日，莫斯科像过节一样打扮起来，大街上红旗飘扬，“3月1日全民参加选举”的标语到处可见。设在各条大街上的选举站灯火通明。从清晨起，人们兴高彩烈地来到选举站门前，准备履行公民的权利。正当克里姆林宫的钟声响了八下时，全市上千的选举站同时打开大门欢迎选民。
    据俄罗斯共和国中央选举委员会统计，到下午六时就全部投票完毕。几乎全体公民都积极热情地投了票。例如，莫斯科市投票者占选民99.29％，梁赞州占99.99％等等。（附图片）
