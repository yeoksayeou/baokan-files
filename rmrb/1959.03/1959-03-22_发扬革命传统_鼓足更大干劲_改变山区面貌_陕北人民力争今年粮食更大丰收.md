Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition, Summon Greater Drive, Change the Face of the Mountainous Areas
People of Northern Shaanxi Strive for a Greater Grain Harvest This Year

(Our report) The people of the old revolutionary base area of Northern Shaanxi are carrying forward their glorious revolutionary tradition and striving, with soaring energy, for a greater leap forward this year on the basis of the great leap forward last year. This year, the total grain output of the entire region will double on the basis of doubling last year, so that this historically grain-deficient area will leap from self-sufficiency last year to prosperity; the face of the mountainous area, which has always been considered barren, will also be greatly changed.

At present, various tasks in the rural areas of Northern Shaanxi are flourishing. More than one million laborers in the region, formed into specialized teams for fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, and wheat field management, are working hard in the freezing cold. Everywhere in the thousands of mountains and gullies are crowds of people accumulating fertilizer. More than 10,000 specialized fertilizer accumulation teams are lighting bonfires to smoke fertilizer on the mountainsides, with thick smoke rising everywhere. Groups of people break through the white snow to blast frozen soil in the forest, finding many rotten branches and fallen leaves to fill fertilizer cellars. Large and small vehicles loaded with manure are constantly shuttling back and forth in the gullies. More than 200,000 people, forming a water conservancy army, are braving the severe cold to persist in construction at more than 100 construction sites, and the sound of chiseling mountains and blasting rocks is shaking the valleys. Near the rivers, thousands of farmers are opening ice blocks and carrying ice to irrigate the fields. As of now, the Yan'an and Yulin regions have accumulated a total of 190 billion jin of fertilizer, which is equal to the total amount of fertilizer applied to all cultivated land in 1958. The existing irrigated area has reached 2.16 million mu, more than double the actual irrigated area in 1958; snow removal and ice transportation for field irrigation have reached 470,000 mu; and more than 2 million mu of newly built and repaired contour terraces and 6.9 million mu of deep plowing have also greatly increased compared with 1958. At present, the entire Northern Shaanxi region is carrying out preparatory activities for spring plowing, inspecting all draught animals one by one, strengthening feeding, vigorously repairing farm tools, transporting and selecting good seeds, and preparing to welcome spring plowing.

"Be the masters of nature! Give play to the revolutionary tradition, summon greater drive, change the face of the mountainous areas of Northern Shaanxi, and strive for a greater leap forward this year!" This is the heroic slogan issued by the 2.4 million people of Northern Shaanxi on the basis of the great leap forward last year. The mountainous area of Northern Shaanxi has a complex terrain, with little rainfall, cold climate, and many natural disasters such as wind, sand, hail, drought, and floods. Some people have always believed that high-speed grain production is impossible. However, the practice of the Great Leap Forward proves that as long as we break superstitions, liberate our minds, and give full play to people's subjective initiative, we can change the natural face of Northern Shaanxi. In the past, severe spring droughts, late thawing, and early frosts almost created insurmountable difficulties for the sowing and growth of crops. But in the Great Leap Forward, the masses adopted methods such as starting early and building water conservancy in winter, which avoided frost damage and resulted in an unprecedented bumper harvest. In the past, wind and sand erosion was also regarded as an insurmountable difficulty. However, after studying the local water and sand characteristics, the masses created methods such as using water to pull sand, planting grass and trees, and building windbreaks to stop desert movement. Last year, a total of 5.3 million mu of sandbreak forests were built, which is ten times the afforestation in 1957. At the same time, water was diverted to pull sand, and more than 1 million mu of sand dunes were transformed into farmland, forest land, and pasture land. In the past, people believed that the maximum increase in grain production in barren mountainous areas was only a hundred or so jin. However, last year, there were 5,640 mu of high-yield fields with yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu in this area, and 500,000 mu with yields of 440 jin to 1,000 jin per mu. Many of these high-yield fields appeared on land that people considered barren, bad, or barren in the past. The Dongfanghong People's Commune in Yan'an County cultivated millet with a high yield of more than 4,000 jin per mu on a 35-degree slope. Farmers in Huayuangou, Yulin County, achieved a rice yield of 3,963 jin per mu on barren sandy land. These achievements have further aroused people's soaring enthusiasm. This year, the masses in the entire Northern Shaanxi region have decided to achieve yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu on 20% of the cultivated land, and use these high-yield fields as an advancing position to drive the overall increase in production of general farmland. Judging from the current situation, the grain production increase plans in various places this year are larger than the leap forward last year, and the measures are more specific than last year; leaders at all levels are grasping earlier, faster, better, and tighter than last year, and the enthusiasm of the masses is also greater and more vigorous than last year.

    发扬革命传统　鼓足更大干劲　改变山区面貌
    陕北人民力争今年粮食更大丰收
    本报讯　陕北革命老根据地的人民，正发扬光荣革命传统，以冲天的干劲，在去年大跃进的基础上争取今年的更大跃进。今年，全区的粮食产量要在去年翻一番的基础上再翻一番，使这个历史上的缺粮区由去年的自给自足再一跃而为富裕；一向被认为贫瘠山区的面貌也将进一步大大改观。
    现在，陕北农村中的各项工作蓬蓬勃勃。全区一百多万劳动力分别组成的积肥、水利、麦田管理等专业队，正在冒着零下的严寒，紧张奋战。千山万沟里到处都是积肥的人群，一万多个积肥专业队正在山前山后，点燃起熏肥的火塔，满山遍野，浓烟四起。一群一群的人踏破皑皑白雪到梢林里去炸开冻土，找到了许多腐烂的枯枝落叶肥窖。沟里沟外，满载着粪土的大小车辆，络绎不绝。二十多万人组成的水利大军，在一百多个工地上冒着严寒，坚持施工，凿山炸石的响声，震荡着山谷。在靠近河流的地方，成千上万的农民打开冰块，背冰润田。截至目前，延安和榆林专区共积肥一千九百亿斤，等于1958年全年全部耕地的总施肥量。现有的水地已达二百一十六万亩，比1958年的实灌面积多出一倍以上，扫雪归田和背冰润田共达四十七万亩；新修、补修的水平梯田二百多万亩，深翻地六百九十万亩，也都比1958年有了很大增加。现在，陕北全区正在开展备耕活动，对全部耕畜进行逐槽检查，加强饲养，并大力整修农具，调运、选晒良种，准备迎接春耕。
      “作自然界的主人！发挥革命传统，鼓足更大干劲，改变陕北山区的面貌，争取今年更大的跃进！”这是陕北二百四十多万人民在去年大跃进的基础上发出的豪迈口号。陕北山区地形复杂，雨量少，气候寒冷，风沙、冰雹、旱、涝等自然灾害很多。一向有些人认为高速增产粮食是不可能的。可是，大跃进的实践证明：只要破除迷信，解放思想，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，是可以改变陕北自然面貌的。过去因为春旱严重、解冻迟而霜冻早，几乎给农作物的播种、生长造成了不可克服的困难。但在大跃进中，群众采取早动手，冬季修水利等办法，结果避开了霜冻，获得空前的大丰收。过去风沙的侵袭也被看成是无法征服的困难，但是，群众研究了当地水、沙等特性之后，创造了以水拉沙、种草植树、营造防风林等办法制止沙漠流动，去年共营造防沙林五百三十万亩，等于1957年造林的十倍。同时，引水拉沙，改造沙丘为农耕、林牧地一百多万亩。过去，人们认为贫瘠山区粮食增产最多不过百十斤，但是，去年这个地区出现的亩产千斤以上的高产田就有五千六百四十亩，亩产四百四十斤到一千斤的有五十万亩。这些高产田有不少都是在过去人们认为是薄地、坏地或不毛之地上出现的。延安县东方红人民公社在三十五度的山坡上，培育出亩产四千多斤的高额丰产糜子。榆林县花园沟农民，在贫瘠的沙地上试种的水稻亩产达到三千九百六十三斤。这些成就更进一步的激起了人们的冲天干劲。今年，陕北全区的群众决定要在占耕地面积20％的土地上，达到亩产千斤以上，并且以这些高额丰产田为前进阵地，带动一般农田全面增产。从目前情况看，今年各地的粮食增产计划比去年跃进的幅度更大，措施也比去年更加具体；各级领导比去年抓得更早、更快、更好、更紧，广大群众的干劲也比去年更大、更猛。（王永）（附图片）
