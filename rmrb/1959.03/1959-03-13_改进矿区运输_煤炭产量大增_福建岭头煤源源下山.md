Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th - Lingtou Coal Mine in Yong'an County, Fujian Province, has improved mine transportation using indigenous methods, increasing the average daily coal production from three tons to sixty-one tons, and significantly reducing costs compared to the past.

Fujian Province has few coal mines, and Lingtou Coal Mine is a "small-scale indigenous group" mine established last year. The coal here is not only supplied to the Xiyang Iron Plant in Yong'an County for iron smelting but is also transported to the newly built industrial area of Sanming County in Fujian and supplied to the residents of Fuzhou for civilian use.

This coal mine has considerable coal reserves, but due to the coal kilns being located on cliffs, transportation was inconvenient, and there was even no place to stockpile coal, making large-scale mining impossible. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the workers launched a transportation innovation campaign of "everyone participating, everyone contributing ideas." They went up the mountain to fell trees and cut bamboo, wove bamboo ropes to replace steel ropes, built bamboo and wooden tracks, wooden chutes, and aerial cableways, and also built a platform that could store one thousand tons of coal. Now, the mine's horizontal adit has bamboo tracks, from the adit entrance to the top of the cliff there are wooden tracks, connected to the wooden tracks and the foot of the mountain is an 84-meter-long wooden chute, next to the wooden chute are two aerial cableways, and at the foot of the mountain there is also a simple highway. Through this transportation line, the extracted coal can be continuously transported down the mountain.

### 改进矿区运输　煤炭产量大增  福建岭头煤源源下山

    改进矿区运输　煤炭产量大增
    福建岭头煤源源下山
    新华社福州12日电　福建永安县岭头煤矿用土办法改进矿区运输，使煤的平均日产量由原来的三吨提高到六十一吨，成本也比原来降低了许多。
    福建省煤矿很少，岭头煤矿是去年建立起来的一个“小土群”煤矿。这里的煤除了供永安县西洋铁厂炼铁之外，还运到福建新建的工业区三明县和供福州市民用。
    这个煤矿煤的储量不少，但由于煤窑开在悬岩之上，运输不便，甚至堆煤的地方也没有，不能大量开采。工人们在党支部的领导下开展了一个“人人动手，个个献计”的运输革新运动，他们上山伐木、砍竹，自编竹绳代替钢绳，修建了竹木轨道、木滑道和架空索道，还修了可以堆放一千吨煤的平台。现在，这个煤矿的矿井平洞有竹轨道，从洞口到峭壁顶端有木轨道，接连木轨道和山脚的是一条长八十四公尺的木滑槽，在木滑槽旁有两条架空索道，山下还有一条简易公路。通过这条运输线，采出的煤就可以源源不断地运到山下。
