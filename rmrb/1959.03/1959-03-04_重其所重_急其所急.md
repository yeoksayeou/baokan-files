Placing basic construction projects in order of priority is an important step in the "nationwide coordination" approach. This step can ensure that manpower, materials, and financial resources are used rationally, so that basic construction projects are completed more abundantly and quickly.

On the surface, it may seem that all projects, regardless of their importance, should advance simultaneously in order to complete more of them. However, this is not the case. Because materials and equipment are produced gradually, and the labor force is also limited within a certain period. Simultaneous advancement would only result in "dividing forces," making it impossible to concentrate superior strength for a swift resolution. Therefore, we advocate prioritizing projects according to their importance and urgency, and even prioritizing those that are important and urgent. In this way, ensuring the rapid completion of key national projects will create even more favorable conditions for other projects to commence in sequence. The entire basic construction plan can then proceed in an orderly manner and be completed quickly.

The industrial basic construction in Beijing during the first quarter has achieved "emphasizing what is important and expediting what is urgent," which is in line with the spirit of "nationwide coordination." In order to win more splendid victories on the basic construction front, this approach should be promoted. (Attached photo)

### 重其所重　急其所急

    重其所重　急其所急
    基本建设项目排队，是“全国一盘棋”的重要一着。这一着棋，可以保证人力、物力、财力得到合理的使用，使基本建设工程完成得又多又快。
    从表面上看，好像所有工程不分轻重齐头并进，才能完成的多。其实不然。因为材料、设备是陆续生产出来的，劳动力在一定时间内也是有限的。要齐头并进，结果只能是“分兵把口”，不能集中优势力量，速战速决。因此，我们主张轻重缓急要排队，重重急急也要排队。这样，保证国家的重点工程尽快完成，也就为其他工程依次上马创造了更加有利的条件。整个基本建设计划也就能循序前进，迅速完成。
    北京市第一季度的工业基本建设，作到了“重其所重，急其所急”，符合“全国一盘棋”的精神。为了在基本建设战线上打更多的漂亮仗，应该推广这种作法。（附图片）
