　　(Dispatch from our newspaper) The "Common Market" of the six Western European countries has been officially open for only two months, but the "European Coal and Steel Community," also composed of these six countries, is facing the danger of collapse due to a severe economic crisis.

　　The "European Coal and Steel Community" is an international coal and steel cartel organization established in April 1951 by West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. At that time, Western propagandists touted this organization as a pioneer of "European unity and cooperation." But now, because the members of this alliance are all in an economic crisis with declining coal and steel production, their mutual struggle is becoming increasingly fierce. In 1958, the steel production of the "Coal and Steel Community," except for France and the Netherlands, decreased compared to 1957. Luxembourg decreased by 2.9%; Belgium decreased by 3.3%; West Germany decreased by 6.4%; Italy decreased by 7.4%. In 1958, the coal production of the four major countries also decreased compared to the previous year. The proportion of the decline was: West Germany 0.5%; France 1.8%; Belgium 26.9%; Italy even reached 9.8%. At the same time, a serious coal sales crisis occurred in the "Coal and Steel Community." Currently, the coal stockpiled in the "Coal and Steel Community" countries in coal mines and in the hands of consumers will reach 55 million tons. West Germany and Belgium are the most serious. In West Germany, the inventory of unsold coal and coke has exceeded the 14 million-ton mark. From February to the end of last year, the Ruhr coal mine owners have forced more than 170,000 miners to implement more than 1.5 million compulsory "layoffs." Since the beginning of this year, half of the mines in the Ruhr area have implemented a "shift shutdown" system. In Belgium, coal stocks have reached more than 7 million tons. Miners have five to twelve days of unemployment each month. The French coal inventory is also "piling up to an alarming degree" (Paris "Le Monde"), thus beginning to limit coal production. Around the above-mentioned crisis of the "Coal and Steel Community," a dispute is brewing within the six "small Europe" countries. For the monopoly capital of the six countries, the central issue of this dispute is: how to shift the crisis to other countries and continue to protect their huge profits. In order to reduce the coal industry crisis, West Germany, on the one hand, reduced prices for dumping abroad, and also decided to increase the import tax on coal from February 16, increasing it by $4.76 per ton. This is actually a violation of an important principle stipulated by the "Coal and Steel Community" to "abolish various tariff restrictions." Belgian mines are relatively backward. After it joined the "Coal and Steel Community" and lowered tariffs, it has been at a disadvantage in competition with West Germany and the Netherlands. Belgium is also very dissatisfied with this, and recently openly accused the Netherlands of constantly dumping American coal into Belgium. In order to cope with the Belgian coal industry crisis, the senior agency of the "Coal and Steel Community" ordered Belgium to close those "unprofitable" mines. However, as soon as the news came out, more than 100,000 miners in Belgium held a general strike. In view of the severity of the crisis, Belgium has formally proposed to the "Coal and Steel Community" that the senior agency formally declare a clear crisis in the coal industry, thereby stipulating a reduction in coal production in the six countries, otherwise Belgium will declare a "temporary withdrawal from the Coal and Steel Community" or prohibit the entry of coal from Germany, the Netherlands, and France. Obviously, these measures actually mean the collapse of the Coal and Steel Community. France has openly expressed opposition to Belgium's request. Contradictions in this regard are still developing further.

　　In addition to the coal issue, the French steel price issue has now occurred in the "Coal and Steel Community." Not long ago, the de Gaulle government took measures to devalue the franc in order to increase its competitive power within the "Common Market." This made the price of French steel 16% to 28% lower than that of other countries. The French practice of selling at low prices did open up sales for French steel, especially in West Germany. However, it aroused the envy of West German steel monopoly capital. According to "U.S. News & World Report," this French offensive made the Ruhr steel tycoons "very uneasy." Representatives from West Germany and several other countries are now asking France to raise steel prices or impose a compensation tax on French steel companies. France initially refused both suggestions; later, under pressure from West Germany, the French government stated that it could consider the issue of levying a compensation tax under certain conditions.

　　The "European Coal and Steel Community" is actually a predecessor of the Western European "Common Market." The crisis of the "Coal and Steel Community" will inevitably greatly affect the development of the "Common Market." When commenting on the many contradictions in the "Coal and Steel Community," the French "Le Monde" lamented: When distance is created between each other, "it can almost be said that there is no common market." At present, when the "Common Market" has just been born and is less than half a year old, its congenital diseases have already occurred. The "Common Market" countries originally stipulated that from January 1, the import quota should be relaxed to 3% of domestic production. On this basis, the import quota for cars in Italy in January should have reached about 12,000 vehicles, but in reality, it was less than 5,000 vehicles. Moreover, because Italy is afraid of competition from West German and French cars, it refuses to issue import licenses for West German and French cars. This practice by Italy has caused great dissatisfaction in France and West Germany. France has also stopped issuing import licenses for Italian cars in retaliation, and West German car dealers are also asking the government to take similar actions.

　　The contradictions and infighting between the interests of the "Common Market" countries have caused many Western newspapers to worry about its future. The French "Echo" said: "The Common Market does not actually work during peak seasons, and it cannot withstand the test when facing economic recession." Last year, the "Common Market" countries and non-"Common Market" countries launched a big melee to compete for the market. When the "Common Market" officially took effect, the six countries within the "Common Market" experienced many contradictions and conflicts. All this foretells that as the economic crisis of capitalist countries intensifies, their conflicts of interest will become more profound and acute. (Attached picture)

### 资本主义经济危机日益加深  西欧国家利害冲突更加尖锐  “煤钢联营”濒于瓦解“共同市场”前景暗淡

    资本主义经济危机日益加深
    西欧国家利害冲突更加尖锐
    “煤钢联营”濒于瓦解“共同市场”前景暗淡
    本报讯　西欧六国“共同市场”正式开张不过两个月，而同样由这六国组成
  “欧洲煤钢联营”却由于严重的经济危机而面临瓦解的危险。
    “欧洲煤钢联营”是西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡六国在1951年4月成立的一个国际煤钢卡特尔组织。当时西方宣传家们曾大事吹嘘这个组织是“欧洲统一和合作”的先驱。但是现在由于这个联营组织的成员都处在煤钢生产下降的经济危机之中。从而使它们的相互斗争日益激烈。在1958年“煤钢联营”的钢产量除了法国和荷兰外都比1957年下降了。卢森堡下降2.9％；比利时下降3.3％；西德下降6.4％；意大利下降7.4％。1958年四个主要国家的煤产量也都比前一年下降了。下降的比例是：西德0.5％；法国1.8％；比利时26.9％；意大利甚至达到9.8％。同时在“煤钢联营”中还发生了严重的煤炭销售危机。目前“煤钢联营”国家积存在煤矿矿场上和消费者手里的煤将达五千五百万吨。其中以西德和比利时最为严重。在西德卖不出去的煤和焦炭的存货已突破一千四百万吨大关。从去年2月到年底，鲁尔煤矿主已迫使十七万多名矿工实行了一百五十多万次强制性“歇工”。而今年以来，鲁尔区又有一半的矿井实行了“轮班停工”制度。在比利时，煤的存货已达七百多万吨。矿工每月有五天到十二天没有工作。而法国煤的存货也“堆积到令人不安的程度”。（巴黎“世界报”）因而开始限制煤生产。围绕着“煤钢联营”的上述危机，六国“小欧洲”内部又正在掀起一场争吵。对于六国垄断资本来说，这场争吵的中心问题就是：如何把危机转嫁到别的国家头上，而继续保住自己的巨额利润。西德为了减少煤业危机，它一方面削价向国外倾销，同时也决定从2月16日起增加煤的进口税，每吨增加四点七六美元。这实际上是破坏了“煤钢联营”所规定的一个“取消各种关税限制”的重要原则。比利时的矿井是比较落后的，在它参加“煤钢联营”降低关税后，它对西德、荷兰的竞争一直处于劣势。比利时对此也就大为不满，最近曾公开指责荷兰不断向比利时倾销美国煤。为了应付比利时的煤业危机，“煤钢联营”的高级机构命令比利时关闭那些“不赚钱”的矿井。但是消息一传出来，比利时全国十多万矿工就举行了总罢工。鉴于危机的严重性，比利时已正式向“煤钢联营”提出：由高级机构正式宣布煤业明显危机状态，从而规定减少六国煤产量，否则比利时就宣布“临时退出煤钢联盟”，或者禁止德国、荷兰和法国的煤入境。显然，这些措施实际上意味着煤钢联营的瓦解。对于比利时这个要求，法国已经公开表示反对。这方面的矛盾还在进一步发展中。
    除了煤的问题外，现在“煤钢联营”中又发生了法国的钢价问题。不久以前，戴高乐政府为了提高在“共同市场”内的竞争力量采取了法郎贬值的措施。这样一来就使法国的钢的价格比其他国家要低16％到28％。法国这种削本贱卖果然使法国的钢打开了销路，特别在西德销路大增。但是惹起了西德钢铁垄断资本的眼红。据“美国新闻与世界报道”说：法国这一进攻使鲁尔钢铁大亨“感到非常不安”。现在西德和其他几国的代表都要求法国提高钢价，或向法国钢铁企业课一种补偿税。法国对于这两项建议起初都表示拒绝；后来在西德的压力下，法国政府又表示对于征收补偿税问题在某种条件下可以加以考虑。
      “欧洲煤钢联营”实际上是西欧“共同市场”的一个前身。“煤钢联营”的危机必然会大大影响“共同市场”的发展。法国“世界报”在评论“煤钢联营”的重重矛盾时，曾感慨地说：当彼此产生距离时，“简直可以说，没有什么共同市场”。在目前“共同市场”刚刚出生还不满半足岁时，它的先天的病症就已发生了。“共同市场”国家本来规定从1月1日开始放宽进口限额到本国产量的3％。在这基础上，意大利1月份汽车输入的限额本来应该达到一万二千辆左右，但是实际上还不到五千辆。而且意大利由于害怕西德和法国汽车的竞争，不肯发给西德和法国汽车输入的许可证。意大利这种做法引起了法国和西德的极大不满。法国为了报复也已停止意大利汽车输入的许可证，而西德的汽车商也正在要求政府采取同样行动。
      “共同市场”各国利害的矛盾和倾轧已经使不少西方报刊为它的前途感到担忧了。法国“回声报”说：“共同市场实际上旺季时不起作用，在面临经济衰退时就经不起考验”。去年“共同市场”国家和非“共同市场”国家曾为争夺市场展开一场大混战。而当“共同市场”正式生效后，
  “共同市场”内的六国又发生重重的矛盾和冲突。这一切预示随着资本主义国家经济危机的加重，它们彼此利益的冲突也更加深刻和尖锐化。（附图片）
