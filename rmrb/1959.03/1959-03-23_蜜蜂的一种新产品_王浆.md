A New Product of Bees - Royal Jelly

"Royal Jelly"—also known as bee milk—is a substance secreted by the pharyngeal glands of bees (worker bees). It is called royal jelly because it is a food specifically used by bees to feed the queen bee.

Those familiar with bee colony life know that both the queen bee and the worker bee are female insects. Whether a female egg develops into a queen bee or a worker bee mainly depends on the influence of royal jelly. Within three days after bee eggs hatch into larvae, bees feed these larvae with royal jelly. However, if the larvae continue to be fed with royal jelly after three days, they will develop into queen bees with fully developed reproductive organs. Conversely, if royal jelly is not given, and only ordinary pollen and honey mixture—bee bread—is used as the larval feed, they will develop into worker bees with incomplete reproductive organs. Furthermore, the entire growth time of the queen bee is only sixteen days, which is five days shorter than the twenty-one days required for a worker bee to grow from egg to adult.

Also, the egg-laying queen bee, due to eating nutritious royal jelly, can lay 1,500 to 2,000 eggs in a single day during the peak production period, and the total weight of these eggs exceeds the weight of the queen bee itself. Moreover, because the queen bee regularly feeds on royal jelly, its lifespan can reach more than five years, while worker bees only live for more than a month, and at most eight months during the wintering period of the bee colony.

From the above facts, it has been proven that royal jelly has the effect of stimulating reproductive activity and prolonging life.

Last year, the Beijing Poultry Farm, the Biology Department of Peking University, and the Beijing Medical College jointly established a socialist collaboration to conduct a series of studies on the production, scientific preservation, clinical application, and pharmacological determination of royal jelly.

Research has shown that royal jelly, in addition to containing abundant amino acids and various vitamins, also contains several rare substances and radioactive substances with special medical effects. Experiments have also proven that royal jelly has significant effects on strengthening the heart, restoring the function of endocrine glands, diabetes, female infertility, and enhancing disease resistance. It has also been proven that royal jelly has no toxic reactions.

In terms of royal jelly production, the method of artificially cultivating queen bees is used, and one hundred to two hundred milligrams of royal jelly can be obtained from each queen cell. A relatively successful experience has been obtained for the mass production of royal jelly. With one hundred bee colonies, more than ten kilograms of royal jelly can be produced per month.

Fresh royal jelly taken from the queen cells quickly turns yellow and deteriorates at ordinary room temperature, especially under the influence of sunlight. Experiments have proven that the quality of royal jelly can be preserved and maintained by adopting refrigeration or freeze-drying methods.

Royal jelly is a substance with high nutritional value and is easily absorbed by the human body. It obviously also contains undiscovered elements, which are precisely what the human body needs and can prolong life. This issue awaits further exploration by the medical community.

### 蜜蜂的一种新产品——王浆

    蜜蜂的一种新产品——王浆
    “王浆”——也叫作蜂乳，是蜜蜂（工蜂）从咽腺分泌出来的一种物质，这种物质所以叫作王浆，是因为它是蜜蜂专门用来饲喂蜂王的食料。
    熟悉蜂群生活的人们都知道，蜂王和工蜂都是雌性虫，一颗雌性的卵成长为蜂王或者工蜂，主要受王浆的影响。蜜蜂的卵从孵化成幼虫以后的三天内，蜜蜂都用王浆饲喂这些幼虫，但三天以后的幼虫，如果继续以王浆饲喂，就成长为性器官发育完全的蜂王；相反的情况下，如果不给王浆，只用普通的花粉和蜜的混合物——蜂粮作为幼虫的饲料，就成长为性器官发育不完全的工蜂。并且，蜂王整个成长时间只需十六天，比工蜂从卵到成虫需二十一天缩短了五天。
    还有，产卵蜂王由于吃了营养丰富的王浆，在盛产期一昼夜间可以产卵一千五百个至二千个，这些卵的总重量超过蜂王本身的体重。更由于蜂王经常以王浆为食料，它的寿命能达到五年以上，而工蜂只能活一个多月，即使在蜂群越冬期间也最多活八个月。
    从上面的事实看来，已能证明王浆具有刺激生殖活动和延长寿命的作用。
    去年，北京市家禽场、北京大学生物系和北京医学院共同建立了社会主义大协作的关系，对王浆的生产、科学保存、临床应用以及药理测定等方面作了一系列的研究。
    研究证明王浆中除含有丰富的安机酸和多种维生素外，还有若干具有医疗特效的稀有物质和放射性物质。实验也证明了王浆对强心，恢复内分泌腺的机能，糖尿病，妇女不孕症和增强抗病力等有显著的效果。同时也证明王浆没有任何毒性反应。
    在王浆生产方面，采用人工培育蜂王的方法，可以从每个王台中获得一百至二百毫克王浆。大量生产王浆，已经得出一套比较成功的经验，用一百群蜜蜂，每月可以生产出十公斤以上的王浆。
    从王台中取出的新鲜王浆，在普通室温下，尤其受阳光的影响，王浆很快就变为黄色并且变质。实验证明，采取冷藏或冷冻干燥的方法，可以保存并保持王浆的质量。
    王浆是一种营养价值很高而且容易为人体吸收的物质，其中显然还含有尚未发现的东西，这些正是人体需要并能延长寿命的东西，这个问题，有待于医药界作更进一步的探索。
