    "Sword Testing" and "Great Battle"
    Zeng Zhi

    Regarding last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's even Greater Leap Forward, members of the Shengli (Victory) Commune in Longxi County, Fujian Province, have a vivid analogy: "Last year was sword testing, this year is great battle."

    This analogy is truly excellent! It shows that although grain and cotton production doubled last year, and in some places even quadrupled, people were not dizzy and floating on air in the face of achievements. It also reflects the spirit of people constantly revolutionizing and moving forward, reflecting the people's lofty aspirations to achieve an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    Indeed, last year's Great Leap Forward was just a first test of mettle for both leaders and the masses. Last year, under the inspiration and call of the Party, the broad masses of cadres and the masses broke free from the shackles of old ideas and began to think boldly and act boldly. The enthusiasm and wisdom of the broad masses of cadres and the masses in building socialism burst forth like colorful fireworks during a festival. In a year of great practice, the sword of the general line for socialist construction, the sword of launching mass movements in production and construction, the sword of technological revolution and the "Eight-Character Charter," were forged, sharpened, and shone with golden light, dazzling and radiant. Are these swords sharp or not? How powerful are they exactly? In 1958, they were given a preliminary test, and they were truly incomparably sharp and infinitely powerful.

    Now that the sword has been tested, this year we must have a great battle. Only a great battle can achieve a great victory; only a great battle can bring great happiness. To have a great battle, we must have an even stronger and more vigorous fighting spirit, even greater and fiercer drive, and even more refined and meticulous strategies. Only people with great wisdom and courage can wield the several swords forged in 1958 freely and win new victories.

    “试剑”和“大战”
    曾志
    对于去年的大跃进和今年的更大跃进，福建龙溪县胜利公社的社员有一个生动的比喻：“去年试剑，今年大战。”
    这个比喻真好！它说明虽然去年粮棉产量翻了一番，有的地方甚至翻了几番，但人们并没有在成绩面前昏昏然飘飘然。它还反映了人们永远向前不断革命的精神，反映了人们实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的雄心壮志。
    是的，去年的大跃进，无论是对领导还是群众来说，都还只是初试锋芒而已。去年，广大干部和群众，在党的启示和号召下，摆脱了旧思想的束缚，开始大胆地想，大胆地干。广大干部和群众在建设社会主义方面的热情和智慧，像节日的多彩的火花一样迸发出来。在一年的伟大的实践中，社会主义建设总路线的宝剑，在生产建设中大搞群众运动的宝剑，技术革命和“八字真经”的宝剑，铸成了，磨好了，金光闪闪，灿烂夺目。这些宝剑锋利不锋利？究竟有多大威力？在1958年，初试了一下，真是锋利无比，威力无边。
    剑试好了，今年要大战。大战才能取得大胜；大战才能带来大幸福，要大战就得有更旺更盛的斗志，更大更猛的干劲，更精更细的韬略。只有大智大勇的人，才能举起1958年铸好的几把宝剑运用自如，赢得新的胜利。
