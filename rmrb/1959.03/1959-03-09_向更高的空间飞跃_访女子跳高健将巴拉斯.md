    Leaping to Higher Heights
    – An Interview with Female High Jumper Balas
    By our correspondent Wei Lingbing

    In the days before International Women's Day, I interviewed Iolanda Balaș, the world-renowned Romanian female high jumper.
    After inviting us to sit down, Balaș excitedly announced some good news: "I'm so happy. I'll be visiting China in May, and I'll be meeting my friend Zheng Fengrong again." Her coach (also her husband), Șoter, immediately chimed in, "Their meeting can be called a 'top-level meeting'!" Before people could figure out what he meant, he explained, "Because both of them have created the highest world records in women's high jump." The Romanian men's high jump record holder's humor immediately drew laughter from everyone.
    Last June, Balaș broke the official world women's high jump record held by Chinese athlete Zheng Fengrong with a jump of 1.78 meters. Subsequently, she broke her own record one after another at an astonishing rate, finally leaping over 1.83 meters, an unprecedented height in women's high jump. However, she is not satisfied with her achievements; on the contrary, she has begun even more diligent training. Although she is very busy with work now, she always takes time to persist in training for one to two and a half hours every day.
    When the reporter asked Balaș how she usually trains, her coach said, "Strong physical strength is the primary condition for every athlete. In addition to practicing high jump, Balaș also often engages in sports activities such as weightlifting, running, and playing basketball." He expressed satisfaction with Balaș's winter training, but then turned to Balaș and said with a complaining tone, "I always want her to train according to the items and time I have prescribed, but she just won't listen to me. She always wants to train more."
    Balaș, who is always thinking of leaping to higher heights, has set a new goal for herself. She said: "People who are satisfied with their work can never move forward. I want to strive to create a higher record, first of all jumping over the height of my own body -- 1.84 meters!"
    Balaș not only values her own progress, but also cares very much about the growth of new female high jump athletes. She proudly told reporters that she has already taken on two young apprentices, who are two girls of fourteen or fifteen years old. Surprisingly, under Balaș's guidance, they have already jumped over 1.45 meters!
    Balaș has great hopes for Chinese female high jump athletes. She said, "I believe Zheng Fengrong can create better results than me, and I also believe that more Zheng Fengrongs can emerge in China!" At this time, Balaș's coach took over the conversation and said: "I also believe that your high jump athletes can emerge in batches, like your steelmaking furnaces."
    Balaș said that she and Zheng Fengrong often exchange letters, and she has received four letters from Zheng Fengrong this year alone. They exchange high jump experience and discuss training conditions in their letters, and they have become close friends.
    The reporter asked Balaș to talk about what she was preparing to do before visiting China. She said: "I will study and practice harder, and when I go to China, I want to observe and compete with my counterparts, so that everyone can make progress together and keep the throne of the world women's high jump record forever in the socialist family!"

### 向更高的空间飞跃——访女子跳高健将巴拉斯

    向更高的空间飞跃
    ——访女子跳高健将巴拉斯
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    记者在国际妇女节的前几天访问了世界闻名的罗马尼亚女子跳高家约兰达·巴拉斯。
    巴拉斯在请我们坐下后，一开头就兴奋地向我们宣布了一个好消息，她说：“我真高兴，5月间我就要去访问中国，又要和我的朋友郑凤荣见面了。”她的教练（也是她的丈夫）薛戴尔马上插嘴说：“她们的会见称得上是‘最高级会见’”。正在人们还没来得及了解他这句话的时候，他接着解释说：“因为她们两人都创造过世界女子跳高的最高纪录”。这位罗马尼亚男子跳高纪录保持者的诙谐立刻引得大家笑起来了。
    巴拉斯在去年6月以一点七八公尺的成绩打破了中国运动员郑凤荣所保持的正式世界女子跳高纪录，随后又以惊人的速度接二连三刷新了自己的纪录，最后跃过了一点八三公尺这个世界女子跳高的空前高度。但是，她并不满足于自己的成就；恰恰相反，她开始了更加勤奋的锻练。她现在虽然工作很忙，但每天总要抽时间坚持锻练一小时到两个半小时。
    在记者问巴拉斯平时怎样锻练时，她的教练说：“坚强的体力是每个运动员的首要条件，巴拉斯除去练习跳高外，还经常进行举重、跑步、打篮球等体育活动。”他对巴拉斯的冬季锻练表示满意，但又转向巴拉斯带着埋怨的口吻说：“我总想要她按我规定的项目和时间进行锻练，她就是不听我的话，她总要多锻练”。
    时刻想向更高的空间飞跃的巴拉斯又为自己定了一个新目标。她说：“对自己的工作感到满足的人就永远不能再前进，我要争取创造更高的纪录，首先跳过我自己的身体的高度——一点八四公尺！”
    巴拉斯不仅重视自己的进步，而且也非常关心新的女子跳高运动员的成长。她骄傲地告诉记者，她已经收了两名小徒弟，她们是两个十四、五岁的小姑娘。使人惊奇的是，在巴拉斯的指导下，她们已经都跳过了一点四五公尺！
    巴拉斯对中国的女子跳高运动员寄予很大希望，她说：“我相信郑凤荣能够创造比我好的成绩，我也相信中国能够出现更多的郑凤荣！”这时，巴拉斯的教练把话头接过来说：“我也相信你们的跳高运动员能像你们的炼钢炉一样，成批成批地涌现出来。”
    巴拉斯说，她和郑凤荣经常有信件往来，今年就收到郑凤荣的四封来信。她们在信中交流跳高经验，谈论锻练情况，她们已经成为亲密的朋友。
    记者请巴拉斯谈谈她在访问中国前准备做些什么，她说：“我要更加勤学苦练，到中国时我要和自己的同行们进行观摩比赛，使大家共同进步，把世界女子跳高纪录的宝座永远留在社会主义大家庭里！”（附图片）
