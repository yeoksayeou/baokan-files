Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 17th: The Indonesian newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial today commenting on the relations between the United Arab Republic and Iraq, saying that every Asian and African country has a responsibility to faithfully abide by the Bandung Conference and Cairo Conference resolutions and avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

The editorial said that if any country, whether the UAR or Iraq, manages its own internal affairs, then harmonious relations can be maintained between Asian and African countries, and at the same time, the position of these countries against imperialism will be strengthened. But if a country begins to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, it will completely violate the Bandung Conference and Cairo Conference resolutions, and will certainly cause disputes.

The editorial said that people cannot help but be surprised that Cairo Radio called the Shawwaf counter-revolutionary rebellion a "revolutionary uprising." The editorial also said that when Nasser accused Qasim of being a "communist agent," did he not know that this was a term that imperialism often forced on Nasser?

"People's Daily" pointed out in another commentary that imperialism, headed by the United States, is unwilling to see the Arab people unite against imperialism and colonialism, and therefore, imperialism spares no effort to pit Iraq and the UAR against each other. For this reason, imperialism is using the old recipe of "international communist danger" again.

The commentary said that the people of Iraq and the people of Indonesia will eventually realize that if they carry out the struggle against imperialism under the banner of anti-communism, then their anti-imperialist struggle will not achieve any success. The commentary also said that anti-communism means opposing national unity, and this is only beneficial to imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 16th: The Pakistani newspaper "Today's News" published an editorial on the 16th, saying: "The differences between President Nasser and Prime Minister Qasim will cause irreparable damage to Arab unity," and "foreign countries waiting for this opportunity may be able to profit from it." It pointed out that "no well-intentioned person in the Arab world can be happy about this dispute."

The newspaper expressed its hope that the leaders of the two countries "should focus on the greater good." It said: "They should not expand differences but should try to narrow them."

The editorial pointed out that the failure of Shawwaf's rebellion "undoubtedly proves that the majority of the Iraqi people are in favor of General Qasim."

It said, "Arab unity by no means means" that all Arab countries "abandon their own characteristics." The editorial also said that the Iraqi revolution "is not a repetition of Egypt's, because the conditions are different in the two countries, the problems are different, and their solutions are also different."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 17th: "L'Humanité" published an editorial saying that the opposition between Cairo and Baghdad is basically due to different views on the issue of "Arab unity." Nasser demanded that Iraq be directly and completely incorporated into the United Arab Republic, and that this merger would be imposed from top to bottom, thus actually amounting to annexation.

The editorial said that Nasser's accusations against Qasim and the Iraqi Communists are completely unfounded. Nasser's attacks can only damage the unity necessary for the struggle of the Arab peoples to maintain and consolidate their independence.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 17th: "The Daily Worker's" editorial today said that the leaders of the United Arab Republic are openly defending the organizers of the Iraqi rebellion, which is only beneficial to the imperialists.

The newspaper asked: "How can it be said that the Iraqi government's suppression of the Mosul rebellion is practicing 'terrorism'? Obviously, the real responsibility for this bloodshed lies with those who organized the rebellion against the legitimate government."

The newspaper continued: "If not all Arab countries want to join the United Arab Republic, it is not because they oppose the idea of ​​Arab countries uniting to fight against imperialism. This kind of unity can be achieved without each country losing its uniqueness. If the current autocratic rule of the United Arab Republic is not imposed on all other Arab countries, this kind of unity will be stronger, not weaker.

"When the leaders of Egypt attack Iraqi 'communism,' it seems that they are calling everyone who opposes immediate accession to the United Arab Republic a 'communist.' Using anti-communism in this way is fatal to any national movement. This immediately provides a basis for imperialist divisive conspiracies.

"Attacking communists is attacking the best fighters for freedom. This does not strengthen, but divides and differentiates the liberation movement. Therefore, this will benefit the imperialists, who are always ready to use those groups who weaken the unity of the people for whatever reason to achieve their own goals."

    各国舆论评论阿联和伊拉克的关系
    阿联攻击伊拉克损害阿拉伯国家团结
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说
    反共意味着反对民族团结
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天发表社论，评论阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克的关系时说，每一个亚非国家都有责任忠实地遵守万隆会议和开罗会议的决议，避免干涉别国的内政。
    社论说，假如任何一个国家，无论是阿联或是伊拉克，都管理自己的内政的话，那么亚非国家之间就可以保持和睦的关系，同时也将加强这些国家反对帝国主义的地位。但是假如一个国家开始干涉另一国家的内政，那么就会完全违反万隆会议和开罗会议的决议，并且肯定会造成争端。
    社论说，人民不能不对开罗电台把沙瓦夫反革命叛乱称为“革命起义”感到惊奇。社论还说，当纳赛尔指责卡塞姆是“共产党代理人”时，他难道不知道，这是帝国主义常常硬加在纳赛尔头上的一个字眼吗？
    “人民日报”在另一篇评论中指出，以美国为首的帝国主义是不愿看到阿拉伯人民团结起来反对帝国主义和殖民主义的，因此，帝国主义不遗余力地使伊拉克和阿联对立起来。由于这个原因，帝国主义又使用“国际共产主义危险”这张老药方。
    评论说，伊拉克人民和印度尼西亚人民随着日子的过去终会认识到，假如他们在反共旗帜下进行反对帝国主义的斗争，那么他们的反帝斗争是不会获得任何成就的。评论又说，反共是意味着反对民族团结，而且这只是对帝国主义有利。
    巴基斯坦“今天报”指出
    大多数伊拉克人支持卡塞姆
    新华社卡拉奇16日电　巴基斯坦“今天报”16日发表社论说：“纳赛尔总统和卡塞姆总理之间的分歧会给阿拉伯团结造成不能挽回的损失”，而“等待这种机会的外国将有可能从中渔利。”它指出，“阿拉伯世界的任何好心人都不能对这种争论感到高兴。”
    这家报纸表示希望两国领导人“要从更大的利益着眼”。它说：“他们不应当扩大分歧而应当设法缩小分歧。”
    社论指出，沙瓦夫的叛乱的失败“毫无疑问地证明大多数伊拉克人民是赞成卡塞姆将军的”。
    它说，“阿拉伯的统一决不意味着”一切阿拉伯国家“放弃自己的特性”。社论还说，伊拉克的革命“不是埃及的重复，因为两国的条件不同，问题不同，它们的解决办法也不同。”
    法国“人道报”指出
    纳赛尔的指责没有道理
    新华社巴黎17日电　“人道报”发表社论说，开罗和巴格达之间的对立，基本上是由于对“阿拉伯统一”问题的看法不同。纳赛尔要求伊拉克直接完全并入阿拉伯联合共和国，而且这种合并将是自上而下强加于人的，因此实际上等于兼并。
    社论说，纳赛尔对卡塞姆和伊拉克共产党人的指责是完全没有道理的。纳赛尔的攻击，只能损害阿拉伯各国人民为了维护和巩固自己独立的斗争所必需的团结。
    英国“工人日报”指出
    攻击伊拉克使帝国主义得到好处
    新华社伦敦17日电　“工人日报”今天的社论说，阿拉伯联合共和国的领袖公开为伊拉克叛乱的组织者辩护，这只对帝国主义者有利。
    这家报纸问道：“怎么能说伊拉克政府镇压摩苏尔叛乱是在实行
  ‘恐怖主义’？很明显，这次流血事件的真正责任要由那些组织叛乱来反对合法政府的人来负。”
    报纸接着说：“如果不是所有的阿拉伯国家都希望并入阿拉伯联合共和国，那并不是因为它们反对阿拉伯国家团结起来同帝国主义作斗争的主张。可以在每个国家不失去它的独特性的情况下实现这种联合，如果不把现在阿拉伯联合共和国的专制统治强加在所有其他阿拉伯国家的身上，这种联合会更强固，而不是更削弱。
    “当埃及的领袖们攻击伊拉克‘共产主义’的时候，看来，他们是把每一个反对立即加入阿拉伯联合共和国的人都叫做‘共产党人’。这样来利用反共，对任何民族运动来说，都是致命的。这使得帝国主义的分裂阴谋立即有了基础。
    “攻击共产主义者就是攻击争取自由的最优秀的战士。这不是加强而是分裂和分化解放运动。因此，这样就能使帝国主义者得到好处，他们随时准备利用那些不论由于什么理由而削弱人民的团结的集团来达到他们自己的目的。”
