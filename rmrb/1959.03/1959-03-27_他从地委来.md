The management area's meeting room was brightly lit, and the get-together for new and old commune members was in full swing. The chairman announced: "Now, let's invite Secretary Wang of the Jinzhong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China to speak."

A wave rippled through the crowd: "When did Secretary Wang arrive?" "Which one is Secretary Wang?"…

A lean, energetic middle-aged man stood up calmly from the crowd and walked onto the stage. He said: "Comrades, my name is Wang Rong. I am not speaking to you as the Prefectural Committee Secretary, but as a new commune member..." The commune members listened and whispered to each other: "New commune member Old Wang is actually the Prefectural Committee Secretary, who would have thought!" "Comrade Old Wang can really endure hardship, he's simply a top-notch farmer."

Once Wang Rong's "background" was revealed, people naturally focused their attention on him. Everyone recalled some of the circumstances of his initial arrival at Zhangqing Village: It was noon on March 8th, when he arrived here with thirty young men and women, carrying luggage and covered in dust. The management area assigned him to work in the Seventh Team. He dropped his luggage, ate lunch in the commune members' canteen, and then went to find Team Leader Wang Gouwa to get work assignments. Everything seemed so natural, as if he had returned to his own home. In the fields, no matter what he did, he did it neatly and efficiently. People were secretly amazed: "This person doesn't seem like a novice!" Early the next morning, before dawn, he arrived at the team's office. The team's courtyard was quiet, with no one around. He picked up a broom and started sweeping. By the time he was almost finished, Team Leader Gouwa and the commune members arrived one after another.

Wang Rong didn't do this to show off to everyone. He still remembered that after the Party organization officially approved him to become a commune member in the Shuguang People's Commune of Yuci City, a nameless sense of honor arose spontaneously; in his excitement, he made such a plan: he would truly appear as an ordinary worker, and in terms of ideological feelings, and in heavy physical labor, he would integrate with the peasants. He would strive to be a "Five-Good" commune member with good ideology, good labor, good work, good unity, and good learning. After coming down, he did whatever the commune members did every day. He went to the fields earlier than most commune members and returned later than most commune members. Sometimes, when he went to the fields to work, he would carry a basket and a dung fork, picking up manure as he walked.

This old cadre from a peasant background could handle any kind of agricultural work. However, since leaving the countryside in 1938, he had not formally or continuously worked in the fields for a long time. In addition, years of revolutionary work had taken a toll on his health. Therefore, heavy physical labor did bring him considerable pain. On the third day of participating in labor, blisters appeared on his palms, and his thumb and index finger split. He gritted his teeth, wrapped them with cloth, and was afraid of being seen. One night, his old insomnia returned. In the morning, his whole body ached terribly. People advised him to lie down for a while, but he still insisted on going to the fields on time. He secretly encouraged himself: "Must persevere to the end, and must not slack off!"

When Wang Rong arrived at Zhangqing Village in Yuci City, it was the time to plant spring barley. According to the team's plan, more than 140 mu of barley had to be planted in eight days, but there was not enough labor, and even with a tight schedule, they could only plant six mu a day. Wang Rong carefully analyzed the situation and decided to assist the production team in solving the problem. First, he reduced the "logistics" personnel, and then, together with the team cadres, he formulated a detailed and reasonable labor plan. In order to encourage commune members to work more shifts and work harder, he sacrificed his rest time and took the lead in writing three big-character posters, praising the hard work and skillful work of Gao Sanni, Yan Guilan, Xu Qingtang, and all the kitchen staff in enthusiastic language. As a result, the agricultural production front was strengthened, and with more than sixty male and female laborers in the team, they achieved "three shifts" every day, and the daily progress of barley planting rapidly increased to fifteen mu.

Helping the production team solve the contradiction of insufficient labor was just one example. Since becoming a commune member, Wang Rong has helped his production team and the management area solve many problems. He clearly understood that going to the people's commune as a commune member was not just to bury himself in labor. As a leader, he must specifically help with work at the grassroots level while participating in labor, thereby enriching his practical work experience. Therefore, in the production team, he was not only a good laborer, but also an active member who was enthusiastic about the team's work. During breaks in the fields or when resting at home, he would chat intimately with the commune members about family matters and discuss problems in production and work. When the team held meetings to study work, he helped the production team cadres come up with ideas and find solutions.

After the get-together, the news that the Prefectural Committee Secretary was a commune member immediately spread throughout the village. People who had not worked hard enough before said: they would guarantee to be "Five-Good" commune members; those who were actively working worked even harder. Everyone said excitedly: working with the Prefectural Committee Secretary, they didn't feel tired even when they were exhausted.

    他从地委来
    李文珊　梁毅
    管理区的会议室灯光通明，新老社员联欢会正开得红火热闹，主席宣布：“现在请中共晋中地委王书记讲话。”
    人群里掀起了波涛：“王书记什么时候来的？”“那一个是王书记？”…… 
    一位身材瘦长神彩奕奕的壮年人，不慌不忙地从人群中站起来，走上了主席台。他说：“同志们，我叫王荣。我现在不是以地委书记的身份同大家讲话，我是以一个新社员的身份在这里发言……”社员们一边听着，一边小声议论：“新社员老王原来就是地委书记啊，真没想到！”“老王同志真能吃苦，简直是个呱呱叫的庄稼人。”
    王荣的“来历”一暴露，人们便很自然地把注意力集中在他的身上。大家回忆起他初到张庆村的一些情况：那是3月8日的中午，他同三十个青壮年男女一起，带着行李，仆仆风尘地来到这里。管理区把他分配到七队劳动，他扔下行李，到社员食堂里吃了午饭，就去找队长王狗娃领活计。一切都表现的那么自然，活像回到了自己的家。到了地里，无论干什么，他都弄得干净利落。人们暗暗吃惊：“这人可不像个生手啊！”第二天一早，天才麻麻亮，他就到了队房。队房的大院子，静悄悄的没有一个人，他顺手拿起扫帚就扫起来，赶他快扫完的时候，队长狗娃和社员们陆陆续续来了。
    王荣并不是为了给大家摆样子才这样干的。他还记得，当党组织正式批准他到榆次市曙光公社当社员之后，一种无名的荣誉感油然而生；在兴奋和激动之下，他就做了这样的打算：要切实以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现，在思想感情上，在繁重的体力劳动中，都要和农民打成一片。争取做个思想好、劳动好、工作好、团结好、学习好的“五好”社员。下来以后，每天，社员干什么，他就干什么。上地比一般社员去得早，下工比一般社员回得迟。有时下地劳动，还要担上箩头拿上粪杈，一边走路，一边拾粪。
    这个农民出身的老干部，对于农业活，可以说样样都拿得起，放得下。但是，自从1938年离开农村以后，再没有正式的长期的在田间干过活，加上多年来从事革命工作，把身体搞得挺糟，所以，繁重的体力劳动，确也给他带来了不少痛苦。参加劳动的第三天，他手掌上磨起了血泡，虎口也都震裂了，他咬咬牙，用布缠住，还生怕别人看到。有一天夜里，失眠的老病又犯了。天明，浑身疼痛得不得了，人们都劝他多躺一会儿，但他仍旧坚持按时下地。他暗暗鼓励自己：
  “一定要坚持到底，绝不能先紧后松！”
    王荣到达榆次市张庆村的时候，正赶上种春大麦。按队里的计划，一百四十多亩大麦，要在八天种完，但劳动力不够，紧赶慢赶，一天只能种六亩。王荣仔细分析了一番，便决定协助生产队来解决。先是缩减“后勤”人员，接着，又和队干部们一起，具体制订出合理的劳动规划。为了鼓励社员们多出勤，多干活，他还牺牲了休息时间，带头写了三张大字报，以充满热情的语言，表扬了苦干、巧干的高三妮、阎贵兰、许庆堂及全体炊事人员。这一来，农业生产战线加强了，加上全队六十多个男女劳动力，每天都做到了“三出勤”，大麦播种日进度，便迅速提高到十五亩。
    帮助生产队解决劳力不足的矛盾，这不过是一个例子。自从下放当社员以后，王荣已经帮助自己所在的生产队、管理区解决过许多问题。他清楚地懂得自己到人民公社当社员，并不是要自己“埋头”劳动。做为一个领导者，必须在参加劳动的同时，具体地帮助下面工作，从而丰富自己的实际工作经验。因此，在生产队里，他不仅仅是一个好的劳动者，同时也是一个热心全队工作的积极分子。在田间劳动休息时或在家休息时，他就和社员们亲密无间地谈家常，商量生产中、工作中的问题。队里开会研究工作，他帮助生产队的干部们出主意、想办法。
    联欢会以后，地委书记当社员的消息，立即传遍全村。原来劳动不够好的人们都表示：保证当个“五好”社员；劳动积极的人，干活更加卖力气了。大家兴奋地说：跟地委书记在一块干活，再疲劳也不觉得累。
