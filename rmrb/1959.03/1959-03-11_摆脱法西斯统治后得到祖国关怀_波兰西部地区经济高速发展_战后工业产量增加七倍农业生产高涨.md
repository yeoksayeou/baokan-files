Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 9th: Western Poland's economy has experienced rapid development since the war. The region's industrial output has increased sevenfold since the war. In 1945, the total industrial output value of the western region accounted for only 8.1% of the national total, but now it accounts for more than 27%.

The western region of Poland includes the provinces of Wrocław, Opole, Szczecin, and Koszalin. This area originally belonged to Poland but was under German rule for a long time. After World War II, according to international agreements, the western region was returned to Poland from Fascist Germany. The region's population accounts for a quarter of the total Polish population, and its area accounts for 30% of the country.

During the period of Hitler's German occupation, the western region of Poland was economically backward and did not keep pace with the overall economic development of Germany. It also suffered severe damage during the war. However, after returning to Poland, it became a region of surging national economy, with industrial production growing faster than in other parts of Poland. The region's industrial and agricultural output value now accounts for 30% of the national total.

Over the past fourteen years, the Polish people have built many industrial centers and large factories in this region, and have developed many coal and copper mines, thereby changing the face of the region.

The western region is continuing to be developed. This year, Poland's industrial investment in the western region is 4.2 billion zlotys, accounting for 21.5% of the total national industrial investment. By the end of this year, twenty new enterprises will be put into production.

Agriculture in the western region has also experienced vigorous development in the past fourteen years. In 1945-1946, more than 60% of the cultivated land in the western region was barren due to war damage, and 124,000 farm households were displaced and bankrupted. Now, its cultivated land accounts for 31% of Poland's cultivated land, and its grain production accounts for 27.7% of the national output.

The population of the western region is also increasing year by year. There are now about 7.5 million residents there, and about 200,000 residents move there every year. It is estimated that by 1965, the region's population will reach 9 million. Despite the threats from Mr. Adenauer and West German militarists who say they do not recognize the Oder-Neisse line, the residents of the western region are still building their own houses, constructing gardens, and planting apple trees and various flowers and plants. According to the Five-Year Plan, residential construction in this region will increase by 75%. Everyone understands that it is not only Poland that is defending the Oder-Neisse line, but also the entire socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 8th: In the era of the people's regime, Poland's most backward regions in the past have achieved great development and are playing an increasingly important role in the national economy.

Before liberation, the Polish bourgeoisie divided Polish territory into two parts—"Zone A" and "Zone B." "Zone A" was a relatively developed region of Poland, while "Zone B" was the most backward region. "Zone B" included three provinces: Białystok, Lublin, and Rzeszów. In the past, these areas had no industry, insufficient food, and people were impoverished and wandered around looking for work.

After the working class seized power, the Party and the government were very concerned about the development of these regions. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1950-1955) alone, fifteen large-scale industrial projects and dozens of factories were built in these regions.

Now, the disproportion between "Zone A" and "Zone B" has been narrowed. Living conditions in the two zones have been balanced. Before the war, Białystok residents consumed two-thirds less sugar than residents in other regions, and they had difficulty buying matches. Now, many rural areas have been electrified, and many rural areas have radios. The backward state of "Zone B" in capitalist Poland has become history, and it now demonstrates the vitality of the people's regime.

    摆脱法西斯统治后得到祖国关怀
    波兰西部地区经济高速发展
    战后工业产量增加七倍农业生产高涨
    新华社华沙9日电　波兰西部地区的经济在战后获得了高速度的发展。这个地区的工业产量在战后增加了七倍，1945年，西部地区工业生产总产值只占全国总产值的8.1％，而现在已占27％以上。
    波兰西部地区包括弗罗茨瓦夫、奥波尔、斯才新、科沙林等省。这个地区本是波兰领土，曾经长期被德国统治，到了第二次世界大战以后，根据所签订的国际协定，西部地区才从法西斯德国的手中收归波兰。这个地区的人口占波兰全国人口的四分之一，面积为全国的30％。
    波兰西部地区在希特勒德国占领时期，经济很落后，没有跟上德国的整个经济发展，在战争中又受到严重破坏。但是在回到波兰怀抱之后，它便成了国民经济高涨的地区，工业生产的增长速度比波兰其它各地还快。这个地区的工农业产值现在已占全国总产值的30％。
    十四年来，波兰人民在这个地区建设了许多工业中心，建立了许多大型工厂，开发了许多煤矿和铜矿，从而改变了这个地区的面貌。
    西部地区正在继续建设中。今年波兰对西部地区的工业投资为四十二亿兹罗提，即占全国工业投资总数的21.5％。到今年底，将有二十个新企业投入生产。
    西部地区的农业在这十四年中也获得了蓬勃的发展。在1945—1946年，西部地区因为战争的破坏，有60％以上的耕地处于荒芜状态，有十二万四千农户流离失所和破产。现在，它的耕地已占波兰耕地的31％，它给国家生产的粮食占全国产量的27.7％。
    西部地区的人口也在逐年增长，现在那里约有七百五十万居民，每年迁到那里的居民约二十万人，预计到1965年，这个地区的人口将达九百万。尽管阿登纳先生和西德军国主义分子恐吓说，他们不承认奥得—尼斯分界线，但是，西部地区的居民还是为自己建造房屋，修建花园，种植苹果树和各种花草。依照五年计划规定，这个地区住宅建筑将增加75％。每一个人都懂得，保卫奥得—尼斯分界线的不只是波兰，还有整个社会主义阵营。
    新华社华沙8日电　在人民政权时代，波兰过去最落后的地区已经获得了很大发展，在国民经济中起着日益重要的作用。
    解放以前，波兰资产阶级曾把波兰领土划分成两部分—“甲”区和“乙”区。“甲”区是波兰比较发达的地区，而“乙”区是最落后的地区。“乙”区包括有三个省：比亚威斯多克、卢布林和热绍夫。过去，这些地区没有工业、粮食不够吃，人们一贫如洗，东奔西走，寻找工作。
    工人阶级掌握政权以后，党和政府十分关怀这些地区的发展。单是在六年计划（1950—1955年）期间，这些地区就建成了十五个规模宏大的工业项目和几十座工厂。
    现在，“甲”区和“乙”区不成比例的情况已经缩小了。两个区的生活条件已经平衡。战前，比亚威斯多克居民用糖量比其他地区少三分之二，他们很难买到火柴。现在，许多农村已经电气化，许多农村都有收音机。“乙”区在资本主义波兰的落后状况已成为历史，现在它显示了人民政权的生命力。
