Playing the Qin to Wood
    Zhu Xiangyuan

    The common saying "playing the qin to a cow" means it's a futile effort. However, it's now discovered that music can stimulate dairy cows to produce more milk, so light music is regularly broadcast in cowsheds. "Playing the qin to a cow" is no longer a futile effort, but a measure to increase production.

    Recently, it was reported that someone discovered music can stimulate plant growth. It seems that "playing the qin to wood" has also become a measure to increase production.

    An Indian botanist, Dr. Singh, often played the violin and played symphonic records in his garden. Over time, he found that music stimulated the growth of flowers, plants, and trees in the garden. So, he started formal experiments. In a six-acre paddy field, he broadcast twenty-five minutes of symphonic music every day. After a month, he found that the rice in this field grew more luxuriantly and sturdily than the rice in the same field without music, with plants fifteen inches taller. He then used the same method to have tobacco plants listen to violin performances, and the results were equally good.

    He concluded that plants can also listen to music, and female voices are more effective than male voices.

    Some Indian scientists also invited mimosa plants to listen to classical Indian songs for twenty-five minutes every morning. As a result, these shy plants, after listening to the ancient songs, seemed to be in a better mood, and their growth rate significantly increased.

    These interesting experiments have aroused people's interest and imagination: if plants can really listen to music and grow faster after listening, then agricultural production should not only be mechanized and electrified, but also "musicalized." Erect loudspeakers in the fields and hold "production increase concerts" every day. Composers can directly serve production by creating various movements that crops love to listen to: Rice Development Symphony, Wheat Growth March… The great musician Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" is even more realistic. In order to eliminate weeds, people can use unpleasant noise to torture them… Are these ideas possible?

    Music is a harmonious and melodious sound. Sounds are produced by the vibration of objects. The vibration of a singer's vocal cords produces sound waves, which travel through the air at a speed of 340 meters per second to the listener's ears, causing the eardrum to vibrate. The eardrum, composed of 10,000 transverse fibers and only 0.1 square centimeters in size, has 30,000 nerve endings on it. The vibration is transmitted through them to the brain, and people can enjoy the singer's beautiful singing. Cows are also animals with advanced nervous activity. They have hearing and memory. Farmers in southern China often sing "cow songs" while plowing, singing loudly while holding the plow. The cow is very happy when it hears it, wagging its tail and pulling the plow vigorously. In dairy farms, relaxing and pleasant music, coupled with the gentle massage of the milkers, naturally leads to an increase in milk production.

    The above is about animals, but plants are completely unrelated. Plants have no nervous system at all, let alone hearing. Why can music stimulate their growth?

    As mentioned earlier, music is a rhythmic sound. This rhythmic sound wave can cause the vibration of substances inside plant cells, just like vibrating the eardrum. This vibration may cause a mechanical stimulation effect. Appropriate mechanical stimulation can accelerate plant growth. For example, Chinese farmers use bamboo sticks to "acupuncture" corn to obtain high yields, which has a mechanical stimulation effect. It can be seen that the sound that can stimulate plants does not necessarily have to be pleasant music, and unpleasant sounds will not torture plants.

    Why does mimosa have a particularly good effect after listening to music? This is because it is a plant that is very sensitive to external stimuli. It is named because it closes its leaves when touched, and it is naturally particularly sensitive to sound stimulation.

    The significant effect of female sopranos is not that plants love to listen to female sopranos, but because the frequency of female voices is much higher than that of male voices, often reaching several thousand hertz (that is, vibrating several thousand times per second). The greater the frequency, the faster the vibration and the greater the stimulation may be. For example, high-frequency ultrasound has been used in agriculture in the Soviet Union with good results. This ultrasound has a frequency of more than 20,000 hertz, exceeding the range of human hearing, so it is called ultrasound; if it is lower than 20 hertz, people cannot hear it either, and it is called infrasound. Soviet agronomists use ultrasound of a certain frequency to stimulate potato tubers, which can increase production by 3.4% after planting. Stimulating radish seeds can increase production by 32.7% to 40.6%. Other crops such as wheat, vegetables, and trees can also achieve good results. This is also because the seeds are stimulated by sound waves, causing changes in storage substances such as proteins and accelerating the oxidation process. Experiments have shown that a small amount of ultrasound can stimulate cell division; a medium amount will inhibit it; and a large amount will cause death. Therefore, ultrasound has been used to kill bacteria.

    Whether music can significantly stimulate plant growth remains to be studied. But it is certain that with the development of physics and chemistry, physical stimuli such as sound, light, electricity, and ionizing radiation will be used more and more widely in future agriculture.

    对“木”弹琴
    朱相远
    俗话说“对牛弹琴”，就是徒劳无功的意思。不过现在发现音乐能刺激乳牛多产奶，于是在牛舍里定期播送轻音乐。“对牛弹琴”就不再是徒劳无功，而是增产措施了。
    最近报载竟又有人发现音乐能刺激植物生长，这么一来似乎“对木弹琴”也成了增产措施。
    印度的一位植物学家singh博士，常爱在花园里拉拉小提琴，放两支交响乐唱片，天长日久，竟发现音乐刺激了园中花草树木的生长。他就开始正式试验，在一块六英亩大的稻田里，每天播送二十五分钟交响乐，一月后发现这块田中的水稻，比同样一块田而没有听音乐的水稻，要长得繁盛茁壮，株长要高出十五英寸。接着又依此法去请烟草欣赏小提琴的演奏，结果一样良好。
    他得出结论，植物也能听音乐，并且女声比男声效果更好。
    又有些印度科学工作者请含羞草来欣赏古典的印度歌曲，每天清晨进行二十五分钟，结果这些羞答答的草儿，听了古老的歌曲后，好像心情更加舒畅似的，生长速度显著加快。
    这些有趣的试验，引起了人们的兴趣和想像：如果植物真的能听音乐，而且听了以后还加速生长，那么农业生产就不仅要机械化和电气化，还要加上一条“音乐化”。在庄稼地里架起扩音器，每天举行“增产音乐会”。作曲家就能直接为生产服务了，创作各种作物爱听的乐章：水稻发育交响乐，小麦生长进行曲……。伟大音乐家贝多芬的“田园交响乐”就更富有现实性了。为了消灭杂草，人们可以用难听的噪声来折磨它们……这些想法有可能实现吗？
    音乐是一种和谐而有旋律的声音。声音都是由于物体的振动而产生。歌唱家声带的振动产生了声波，声波在空气里以每秒三百四十公尺的速度，传到听众的耳朵里，引起鼓膜的振动。由一万条横向纤维组成的鼓膜，只有0.1平方厘米大，上面却布有三万条神经末稍，振动通过它们而传至大脑，人们就欣赏到歌唱家优美动听的歌声。牛也是一种有高级神经活动的动物，它有听觉、有记忆力，我国南方农民在犁田时常爱唱“牛歌”，一边扶犁一边高歌，牛听了就十分高兴，摇着尾巴使劲的拉犁。在乳牛场里，轻松愉快的音乐，再加上挤奶人温顺的揉摩，当然就引起产乳量的增加。
    上面说的是动物，植物可就风马牛不相及。植物根本没有神经系统，更谈不上有听觉，为什么音乐能刺激它生长呢？
    前面谈了，音乐是一种有节奏的声音，这种有节奏的声波能引起植物细胞内部物质的振动，就像振动耳朵的鼓膜一样。这种振动可能引起一种机械刺激的作用。适当的机械刺激是可以加速植物的生长的。例如我国农民用竹签来替玉米
  “针灸”而能得到丰产，就有一种机械刺激的作用。由此可见，能对植物引起刺激作用的声音就不一定要是什么悦耳的音乐，而难听的声音也不会折磨植物。
    含羞草为什么听音乐后效果特别好？这是因为它是一种对外界刺激十分敏感的植物。它就因为一碰就把叶子合起来而得名，对声音的刺激当然就格外敏感了。
    女高音效果显著，不是植物爱听女高音，是由于女声的频率要比男声高得多，往往可达好几千赫兹
  （就是每秒钟振动好几千次）。频率愈大，引起的振动愈快，刺激也可能愈大。比如高频率的超声波，目前在苏联已运用于农业，效果很好。这种超声波，频率在二万赫兹以上，超过了人的听觉范围，所以叫超声波；若低于二十赫兹，人也听不见，叫低声波。苏联农学家用一定频率的超声波来刺激马铃薯的块茎，种下以后能增产3.4％。若刺激一下萝卜种子，可增产32.7％—40.6％。其它如麦类、蔬菜、树木，都能得到良好的效果。这也是由于种子受到声波的刺激，使蛋白质等储藏物质发生变化，加速了氧化过程。实验证明：少量的超声波可以刺激细胞分裂；中量就会抑制；大量就会引起死亡。因此，超声波已被用来杀菌。
    音乐到底是否能显著的刺激植物生长，还有待研究。但肯定地说，随着物理学和化学的发展，声、光、电、电离辐射等物理刺激，将在未来的农业中，得到越来越广泛的运用。
