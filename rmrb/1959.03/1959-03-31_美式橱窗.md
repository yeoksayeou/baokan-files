    "American Showcase"
    Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano recently stated that the practice of using the Philippines as a so-called "democratic showcase" in Asia for many years has failed.
    Using the Philippines as a "democratic showcase" for display in Asia was originally a carefully designed idea by American imperialists. According to the meaning of the commercial term "showcase," it is intended for people to admire in order to attract business. However, now things have gone in the opposite direction of the designers' original intentions.
    According to Serrano, in the Philippines, this so-called "democratic showcase," there is neither "national spirit and local (Philippine) characteristics," nor "opportunities to develop our (Philippine) national strength economically." What's more, the Philippine economy has become an appendage of the "American apron strings," and the "strong desire for Philippine national dignity" is not respected! These are just the sporadic situations revealed by Serrano, but they are enough to illustrate what kind of stuff is in this "showcase" set up by the United States.
    In fact, the failure of the American-style "showcase" is not surprising. What is displayed in the "showcase" is all goods with the imprint of American imperialism, and there is absolutely no room for Philippine independence, freedom, and democracy. In this way, Filipinos do not "admire" but hate such a "showcase"; in Asia, it has also played a "business attracting" role, but what it attracts is only contempt and opposition. (Attached image)

### “美式橱窗”

    “美式橱窗”
    菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺最近发表谈话说，多年来把菲律宾作为所谓亚洲“民主橱窗”的做法已经失败。
    把菲律宾作为“民主橱窗”在亚洲进行展出，本是美帝国主义者精心设计的主意。按照“橱窗”这个商业用语的含意来说，它是供人欣赏以广招徕的。但是现在，事情走向了设计人原意的反面了。
    按照塞兰诺的说法，在菲律宾这个所谓“民主橱窗”里，既没有“民族精神和本国（菲律宾）特点”，更没有“机会在经济方面发展我们（菲律宾）的民族力量”，尤有甚者，菲律宾的经济已成为“美国围裙带”的附属品，“菲律宾的民族尊严的强烈愿望”也得不到尊重！这只是塞兰诺透露出来的零星情况，但是这已经足够说明美国摆设的这所“橱窗”的货色如何了。
    其实，美式“橱窗”的失败并不奇怪。“橱窗”里摆的统统是美帝国主义和打着美帝国主义烙印的货色，而菲律宾的独立、自由和民主则完全没有存在的余地。这样，菲律宾人就不是“欣赏”而是憎恨这样的“橱窗”；在亚洲，它也起了“招徕”作用，不过招来的只是蔑视和反对罢了。（附图片）
