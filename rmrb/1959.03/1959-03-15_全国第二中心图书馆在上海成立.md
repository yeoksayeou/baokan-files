Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 14th. The National Second Central Library was established in Shanghai on March 12. This new institution, jointly established by the Shanghai Library and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Shanghai First Medical College, and other units, will serve the development of industrial and agricultural production and scientific research in Shanghai and the whole country in a more planned way.

As early as last year, in the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Shanghai Library established scientific and technological book cooperation relations with more than 80 units' libraries and reference rooms under the central and local industrial departments. They shared resources and greatly exerted the potential of books, providing many useful reference materials for industrial and agricultural production and scientific research in various places.

This year, the National Second Central Library will strengthen its cooperation with the scientific and technological book and material cooperation network of the city's industrial departments; expand inter-library lending relationships with libraries in provinces and cities across the country, as well as scientific research institutions and university libraries.

    全国第二中心图书馆在上海成立
    新华社上海14日电　全国第二中心图书馆3月12日在上海成立。这个由上海图书馆和中国科学院上海分院、交通大学、复旦大学、上海第一医学院等单位的图书馆联合组成的新机构，将更有计划地为上海以及全国工农业生产发展和科学研究服务。
    早在去年工农业生产大跃进的形势下，上海图书馆就与中央及地方各工业部门所属的八十多个单位的图书馆、资料室建立了科学技术图书协作关系，互通有无，大大发挥了图书的潜力，为各地的工农业生产和科学研究提供了许多有益的参考资料。
    全国第二中心图书馆，今年将加强与本市工业部门科学技术图书资料协作网的协作关系；扩大与全国各省、市图书馆以及科学研究机关、大专院校图书馆建立馆际互借关系。
