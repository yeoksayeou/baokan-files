Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 25th: The Iraqi Supreme Military Court began trying the Shawwaf treason case on the evening of the 24th. The first four defendants are aircraft pilots who participated in the Shawwaf rebellion, bombed Baghdad Radio Station, and planned to bomb Prime Minister Qassem's residence.

The Prosecutor General, Muhammad Amin, read a lengthy indictment. The indictment not only included accusations of crimes against these four defendants and detailed information about the Shawwaf conspiracy to commit treason but also exposed the entire process of the United Arab Republic's conspiracy to overthrow the Iraqi Republic. The prosecutor requested the court to sentence these pilots to death.

After he read the indictment, the court president, Colonel Mahdawi, delivered a lengthy speech.

The trial continued until 1:00 AM this morning, and the trial will continue tonight.
