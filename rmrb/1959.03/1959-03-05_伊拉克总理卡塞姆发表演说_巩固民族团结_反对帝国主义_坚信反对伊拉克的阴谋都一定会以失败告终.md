Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 3rd: In a speech delivered at the graduation ceremony of the Reserve Officers Academy on March 2nd, Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim said that Iraq will continue its struggle against imperialism and will defeat them sooner or later. He said: We are advancing on the road to freedom, and through the power of the people, we will surely achieve our goals. No one can make the Iraqi people deviate from the path they have chosen.

He said that one of our goals is collective governance, eliminating personal rule and arbitrary behavior. The people are the rulers, they are the absolute masters.

Qasim said: "We have suffered from the oppression of imperialism for a long time. We will never allow imperialism to make a comeback in our country under any circumstances, or to stay in our country again. We will fight against imperialism."

Qasim pointed out that imperialists are now carrying out "slander, conspiracy and creating chaos" against Iraq. He called on the people to be vigilant to defend the republic.

The Prime Minister pointed out that those traitors, hirelings, conspirators and splitters who oppose our practices will surely fail. He said that the people are awakened and united, and will never be divided again. Now that the people have tasted freedom, imperialist elements, greedy elements or drug traffickers cannot take it away from the people.

Speaking of Iraq's foreign policy, Qasim said that the Iraqi government advocates cooperation with all Arab and non-Arab countries on the basis of mutual benefit. He said that our relations with other countries are based on the principle of friendship.

Speaking of Iraq's relations with other Arab countries, Qasim said that Iraq's interim constitution stipulates that "Iraq is a part of the Arab nation. It is part of a whole, not part of some parts." He said that Iraq, like Tunisia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and all other Arab countries, is part of the Arab nation.

Prime Minister Qasim emphasized that Iraq should achieve consistency in foreign policy with the Arab countries that have already been liberated, and conduct full cooperation in economic policy, military unity and culture.

He emphasized that what we need is friendship, unity, cooperation, and for God, not for personal gain. He asked the Iraqi people to maintain cooperation and tolerance, and not to attack any brother, even if they overstep the bounds. He said that the policy we are pursuing will enable the Arab nation to gain its due position in the world.

Qasim believes that nationalism is everyone's property and honor, and no individual or group can monopolize it.

Prime Minister Qasim recounted his work in 1956 as the head of a military delegation sent by the old Iraqi regime to Jordan to try to overthrow the then Syrian government, in order to thwart the plan to attack Syria. He also recounted the work Iraq has done for the Algerian people, Palestine, and the entire Arab people. He said that Iraq will continue to do so.

Qasim said: "We will support Algeria with all the strength we have." He said that the heroic "Algeria is fighting against the brutal French for liberation and independence, and we provide assistance to Algeria with voluntary and sincere attitude." He pointed out that Iraq guarantees to continue to provide this assistance until Algeria achieves independence.

Qasim said that Iraq intends to develop and strengthen the army. He said that after the recent establishment of the Fifth Army Division in Iraq, a sixth division will be established soon.

Qasim revealed that at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, Iraq will carry out a great revolution to consolidate the republic and ensure its independence.

The Prime Minister recounted that Iraq was once the birthplace of civilization. He pointed out that the Iraqi Republic has concentrated its efforts on economic construction and consolidation of the national economy. He said that factories will soon be established to ensure the happiness and prosperity of the people. He emphasized that the people will be producers, not just consumers. Qasim also said that Iraq focuses on the development of agriculture. The land reform law that has been formulated will be strictly implemented in accordance with regulations.

    伊拉克总理卡塞姆发表演说
    巩固民族团结　反对帝国主义
    坚信反对伊拉克的阴谋都一定会以失败告终
    新华社巴格达3日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆2日在后备军官学院毕业典礼上发表的演说中说，伊拉克将继续进行反对帝国主义的斗争，并且迟早将击败它们。他说：我们正在自由的道路上前进，通过人民的力量，我们必将达到我们的目的。任何人都不能使伊拉克人民离开他们所选定的道路。
    他说，我们的目的之一就是集体执政，消除个人统治和专横行为。人民是执政者，他们是绝对的主人。
    卡塞姆说：“我们长期受着帝国主义压迫的痛苦。我们决不让帝国主义在任何情况下在我国卷土重来，或者是再在我们国家里留下去。我们要同帝国主义进行斗争。”
    卡塞姆指出，帝国主义者现在正在对伊拉克进行“诽谤诬蔑、阴谋和制造混乱”。他号召人民提高警惕来保卫共和国。
    这位总理指出，那些反对我们的作法的叛徒、雇佣者、阴谋家和分裂者都一定会失败。他说，人民觉悟并团结起来，而且今后再也不会分裂。既然人民尝到了自由，帝国主义分子、贪婪分子或贩毒者都不能把它从人民手里夺走。
    谈到伊拉克的对外政策，卡塞姆说，伊拉克政府主张同一切阿拉伯国家和非阿拉伯国家实行以互利为基础的合作。他说，我们同其它国家的关系以友好原则为基础。
    谈到伊拉克同其它阿拉伯国家的关系时，卡塞姆说，伊拉克临时宪法规定，“伊拉克是阿拉伯民族的一部分。它是一个整体的一部分，而不是某些部分的一部分。”他说，伊拉克就像突尼斯、苏丹、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、埃及以及所有其他阿拉伯国家一样是阿拉伯民族的一部分。
    卡塞姆总理强调伊拉克要同已经获得解放的阿拉伯国家在外交政策上取得一致，并且在经济政策上，军事上和文化的统一方面进行充分的合作。
    他强调说，我们需要的是友好、团结、合作和为真主而不是为了私人利益。他要求伊拉克人民保持合作和容忍，不要攻击任何一个兄弟，即使他们越出范围。他说，我们所奉行的政策会使阿拉伯民族在世界上获得它应有的地位。
    卡塞姆认为，民族主义是每个人的财产和荣誉，任何人或集团都不能垄断它。
    卡塞姆总理追述了他在1956年作为一个军事代表团团长被伊拉克旧政权派往约旦去设法推翻叙利亚当时的政府时为了粉碎进攻叙利亚的计划而进行的工作。他还追述了伊拉克为阿尔及利亚人、巴勒斯坦和全体阿拉伯人民进行的工作。他说，伊拉克将继续这样做。
    卡塞姆说：“我们要以我们所拥有的一切力量来支持阿尔及利亚。”他说，英雄的“阿尔及利亚为了争取解放和独立正在同残暴的法国进行战斗，我们本着自愿和真诚的态度对阿尔及利亚提供援助”。他指出，伊拉克保证将继续提供这种援助，一直到阿尔及利亚实现独立为止。
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克打算发展和加强军队。他说，在伊拉克最近建立了陆军第五师以后，不久将建立第六个师。
    卡塞姆透露，在本月底或下月初，伊拉克将进行一次伟大的革命来巩固共和国和保证它的独立。
    这位总理追述说，伊拉克曾经是文明的发祥地。他指出，伊拉克共和国已经集中力量进行经济建设和巩固国民经济。他说，不久将建立工厂以保证人民的幸福和繁荣。他强调指出，人民将是生产者，而不仅仅是消费者。卡塞姆还说，伊拉克集中注意农业的发展。已经制定的土改法将严格按照规定实行。
