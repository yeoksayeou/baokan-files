    How to Achieve High Yields of Jute?
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

    Under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production across the country in 1958, China's jute achieved a bumper harvest, with total output reaching approximately 7 million dan (1 dan = 50 kg), an increase of 222% compared to the highest annual output before liberation. The average unit area yield nationwide was 339.3 jin (1 jin = 0.5 kg) of jute bark per mu (1 mu ≈ 0.0667 hectares), a 20% increase compared to 1957. Four jute "thousand-jin counties" emerged, including Nan'an in Fujian, Chao'an in Guangdong, and Guangfeng in Jiangxi. Furthermore, the Mayuan No. 3 Cooperative in Xinhui County, Guangdong, created a high-yield miracle of 3,220 jin per mu. In addition, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, known domestically for jute production, also achieved a yield of 935 jin per mu across the county's 205,000 mu. The main reason for these achievements was that, under the brilliant light of the General Line, and after the nationwide rectification movement, the right-leaning conservative thinking in jute production was criticized, and comprehensive technical measures centered on close planting were adopted, thereby creating high-yield cultivation experiences of over 1,000 jin.

    Centered on Close Planting
    In order to achieve increased jute production through close planting, the CCP Nan'an County Committee, based on the high-yield experience gained by the Guifeng Cooperative in the county in 1956 and 1957 using double-row, wide-bed close planting methods, promoted this method throughout the county in 1958. The past single-row sparse planting method was changed to double-row, wide-bed close planting, with a bed width of 2.2 chi (1 chi ≈ 0.33 meters), a ditch width of 6 cun (1 cun ≈ 0.033 meters), two rows planted on each bed, a sowing width of 7 cun, a row spacing of 5 cun, and 8 seedlings retained per chi of sowing width during thinning, with a plant spacing of 3 cun, resulting in approximately 30,000 seedlings per mu, doubling the planting density compared to 1957. Due to the increased sowing width, the land utilization rate increased from 37% in 1957 to 60%. Most of the high-yield jute land in Chao'an County, Guangdong, and Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang, adopted the wide-narrow row close planting method, with wide row spacing of 6-9 cun, narrow row spacing of 3-4 cun, and plant spacing of 2.5-3 cun. In 1958, the Tingguang Cooperative in Chao'an County, Guangdong, observed on 0.83 mu of land that single-row planting with 8 x 3 cun spacing yielded 802 jin of jute bark per mu, which was 103 jin less per mu compared to double-row planting with 9 + 4.5 x 2.5 cun spacing (wide row spacing of 9 cun, narrow row spacing of 4.5 cun, plant spacing of 2.5 cun). This shows that under the same cultivation and management conditions, wide-narrow row planting yields more than single-row planting.

    Due to the increased planting density, the sowing amount also increased accordingly. In 1958, most of the high-yield jute land yielding over 1,000 jin per mu used a sowing amount of 1.5 to 2.5 jin of round-pod jute seeds and 1 to 1.5 jin of long-pod jute seeds. To solve the problems that might occur after close planting, jute farmers also relied on past experience to carefully select seeds and prepare the land meticulously during sowing to ensure uniform seedling emergence. In thinning techniques, multiple thinning (3-4 times) and the method of "removing both ends and keeping the middle" were adopted to promote uniform growth of jute plants and reduce the occurrence of inferior jute. In fertilization techniques, multiple, phased topdressing and uniform fertilization methods were adopted to promote robust and uniform growth of jute plants. In addition, after the jute plants were 4-5 chi tall, bamboo poles were inserted in the furrows and jute ropes were pulled to divide the fields for staggered sun-drying of the jute, allowing the jute plants to ventilate and receive light.

    Increased Fertilizer Application
    It is understood that the jute planted in 1958 generally not only increased the application of base fertilizer, but also the frequency and amount of topdressing increased significantly compared to the past. According to a survey of seven typical teams in Nan'an County, Fujian, the amount of organic fertilizer applied per mu in 1958 increased four times compared to 1957, and the amount of chemical fertilizer increased more than doubled; in terms of fertilizer types, the potassium content in the soil was greatly increased. According to the analysis of materials from five typical teams in Guangdong and Fujian, high-yield jute land yielding over 1,000 jin of jute bark per mu, in addition to applying 100-500 dan of soil fertilizer (of relatively poor quality) and 30-70 dan of water fertilizer (30% human waste and urine, 70% water) per mu as base fertilizer before sowing, also adopted the principle of "less first, more later, sparse first, dense later, and emphasizing late-stage topdressing" based on the growth characteristics of jute plants, applying topdressing six times or more after the jute seedlings emerged. When the seedlings were 1-4 cun tall, 20-35 dan of diluted water fertilizer and 5 jin of ammonium sulfate were applied. When the seedlings were 5-9 cun tall, in addition to applying 20-40 dan of diluted water fertilizer and 7-15 jin of ammonium sulfate, 40 dan of soil fertilizer was also used to cover the surface to prevent nutrient loss. When the seedlings were 1-2 chi tall, 40-60 dan of water fertilizer, 10-20 jin of ammonium sulfate, 100-180 dan of soil fertilizer, and 200 jin of plant ash were applied per mu. At this time, applying more soil fertilizer not only prevented nutrient loss, but also helped to cultivate the soil, prevent soil compaction, and prevent jute plants from lodging. When the seedlings were 3-4 chi tall, 30 dan of water fertilizer, 10-25 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 25 jin of potassium sulfate (or 200 jin of grass ash) were applied. When the plants were 5-6 chi tall, 15-30 jin of ammonium sulfate (or 100-150 jin of cake fertilizer) were applied. When the plants were 7-8 chi tall, 20-40 jin of ammonium sulfate were also applied. From the above fertilizer application amounts at various stages of jute plant growth, it can be seen that after the plants are 1-2 chi tall, a large amount of fertilizer needs to be applied to meet the needs of rapid plant growth. In the later stage of jute growth, after the plants are 7-8 chi tall, fertilizer should still be applied according to the plant growth situation to meet the needs of bark thickening and plant growth.

    Deep Plowing One to One and a Half Chi
    Jute is a deep-rooted crop, with the main root reaching more than three chi into the soil. After the soil is deeply plowed, the cultivated layer is deepened, promoting root development, vigorous plant growth, and increased bark yield. The Hongxi Brigade of the Red People's Commune in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, achieved 2,128 jin of jute bark per mu on its 4.55 mu of high-yield land in 1958 due to deep plowing combined with fertilization, which was 644 jin more per mu compared to the 41.15 mu of jute that had not been deeply plowed. In addition, according to the experience of the Yuzhouhong People's Commune in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, deep plowing also prevents jute plants from lodging. Jute seeds are small, and if land preparation is poor, it is easy to form uneven emergence and missing seedlings, and it is also easy to produce inferior jute, affecting yield. According to the deep plowing experience of high-yield fields in 1958, deep plowing one to one and a half chi, combined with other cultivation measures, can achieve large-area yield increase.

    Selection of Fine Varieties
    Jute cultivation experience in 1958 proved that selecting fine varieties is also an effective measure for increasing production. For example, D154, Hongtiegu Ma (Red Iron Bone Jute), and Zhugan Ma (Bamboo Pole Jute) are all relatively good local varieties, and these three varieties generally yield 10% to 30% more than other local varieties. According to past regional jute variety trials, D154 and Xin Xuan No. 1 (Newly Selected No. 1) performed well in Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi, generally yielding 3.9%-38.8% more than other varieties; Xin Feng, Jikou, Bailian Zhi (White Lotus Sesame), and Cuilu (Emerald Green) four jute varieties increased production by 10% in the Zhejiang jute area.

    Jute is a short-day crop, and seeds from the southern region planted in the northern region have a longer growing period, taller plants, thicker bark, and significantly increased fiber yield. The above shows that in addition to selecting fine varieties suitable for local cultivation, such as D154, Xin Xuan No. 1, and Qingpi Jia Ma (Green Pod Jute), the 1959 high-yield jute fields can also introduce seeds from the southern region for planting in the northern region to achieve increased production.

    Timely Early Sowing
    Jute requires a relatively high temperature for germination. The minimum germination temperature is generally 15 degrees Celsius for round-pod varieties and 18 degrees Celsius for long-pod varieties. If sowing is too early, not only will seedling emergence be uneven, but the seedlings will be easily damaged by frost after emergence or grow poorly, resulting in missing seedlings. It is also easy to cause early flowering. If sowing is too late, the growing period will be shortened, the plants will be short, the bark will be thin, and the yield will be reduced. According to observations of jute fields with different sowing dates by the Tingguang Cooperative in Chao'an, Guangdong, the bark yield of sowing seven days before Qingming (Tomb Sweeping Day) is higher than that of sowing fifteen days after Qingming. According to a 1957 survey of high-yield typical teams in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, the sowing period in 1958 was advanced by 10-15 days compared to previous years. This shows that early sowing of jute within the appropriate period, extending the growing period, can increase the bark yield.

    The suitable sowing period for round-pod jute is around Guyu (Grain Rain) in the Yangtze River Basin, between Qingming and Guyu in Fujian, and around Qingming in Guangdong and Guangxi. Long-pod jute seeds require a higher germination temperature than round-pod varieties, and the sowing period should be postponed by 3-8 days compared to round-pod varieties.

    Disease Prevention and Enhanced Field Management
    The high-yield jute fields in 1958 all paid attention to pest and disease control and field management. In terms of preventing jute anthracnose, according to a survey in Nan'an County, Fujian, in addition to the widespread use of cold water and warm water soaking seed treatment and Ceresan seed dressing before sowing, land that had been planted with jute for more than one year was also selected for planting, and potassium-rich burnt soil, plant ash, and wall soil were commonly applied as base fertilizer and topdressing. Attention was also paid to drainage during the jute growing period and ventilation and light transmission in the jute fields. Due to the adoption of the above series of comprehensive prevention and control measures, the damage caused by anthracnose in 1958 was significantly reduced compared to previous years.

    In terms of field management, in addition to achieving early thinning, early seedling setting, multiple thinning (3-4 times), timely transplanting and seedling replacement, and inter-tillage and weeding (3-4 times), special attention was also paid to drainage during the seedling stage and irrigation techniques in the later stage. Irrigation was carried out according to plant growth and climate conditions: jute seedlings require less water, and water should be flowed to the bottom of the ditch during irrigation. When the plants are 1-2 chi tall, they require more water, and water should be poured to half the height of the furrow. After the plants are 3-4 chi tall, they grow particularly fast and require a lot of water. When irrigating, it is advisable to fill the water to one cun from the surface of the bed so that the water permeates the entire bed, preventing it from submerging the surface of the bed and preventing soil compaction. During the mid-growth period of jute in June and July, irrigation should also be carried out depending on the weather. In dry north winds, irrigate every two to three days. In humid south winds, irrigate every six to seven days. Each time, the water should be thoroughly and evenly irrigated.

    怎样叫黄麻丰产？
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1958年在全国农业生产大跃进的鼓舞下，我国的黄麻获得了大丰收，总产量已达到七百万担左右，较解放前最高年产量增加222％。全国单位面积产量平均每亩麻皮三百三十九点三斤，比1957年增产20％。还出现了福建南安、广东潮安及江西广丰等四个黄麻千斤县。广东新会县麻园三社还创造出亩产三千二百二十斤的高额丰产奇迹。此外素以黄麻产地闻名国内的浙江省萧山县，也在全县二十万五千亩的面积上获得亩产九百三十五斤。获得这些成绩的主要原因是在总路线的光辉照耀下，通过全民整风运动后，批判了黄麻生产上的右倾保守思想，采取了以密植为中心的综合技术措施，从而创造出千斤以上丰产栽培经验。
    以密植为中心
    为了达到黄麻密植增产，中共福建南安县委根据该县贵峰社1956及1957两年采用双条宽幅密植的栽培方法所获得的丰产经验，1958年在全县范围内进行了推广，将过去单条稀植的栽培方法改为双条宽幅密植，畦宽二点二尺，畦沟宽六寸，每畦种二条，播幅七寸，幅距五寸，定苗时每一尺的播幅内留苗八株，株距三寸，每亩留苗三万株左右，较1957年栽培密度增加一倍。由于增加了播幅面积，土地利用率由1957年的37％增至60％。广东潮安县及浙江萧山县的大部分丰产麻地都采用宽窄行密植法，宽行距六——九寸，窄行距三——四寸，株距二点五寸——三寸。广东潮安县亭光社1958年在零点八三亩地上，观察到8×3寸的单行种植亩产麻皮八百零二斤，比9＋4.5×2.5寸的双行种植（宽行距九寸，窄行距四点五寸，株距二点五寸），每亩少收麻皮一百零三斤。这说明在同样栽培管理条件下，宽窄行种植比单行种植增产。
    由于栽培密度增大，播种量也相应增加。1958年亩产千斤以上的大部分丰产麻地，每亩播种量圆果种黄麻一斤半到二斤半，长果种一到一斤半。为了解决黄麻密植后可能发生的问题，麻农们还根据过去的经验，播种时精选种子，精细整地，促使出苗整齐。在间苗技术上，采用多次间苗（三——四次）、拔两头留中间的办法，促使麻株生长一致，减少笨麻（低劣的麻）发生。在施肥技术上，采用多次、分期追肥及均匀施肥方法，促使麻株生长粗壮一致。另外在麻株四、五尺高以后，采用在畦沟内插竹杆拉麻绳办法，进行分畦分期晒麻，使麻株通风透光。
    增施肥料
    据了解，1958年种植的黄麻，一般不仅增施了基肥，而且追肥次数及施用量都较以往有显著增加。根据在福建南安县七个典型队的调查，1958年每亩施用有机肥料较1957年增加四倍，化肥增加一倍以上；在施肥种类上，大大地增加了土壤内钾素含量。在施肥方法上，根据广东、福建五个典型队的材料分析，亩产麻皮千斤以上麻地，除播种前每亩施用土肥（质量较次）一百——五百担，水肥（人粪尿占30％，水占70％）三十——七十担作基肥，黄麻出苗以后，还根据麻株生长特性，采用先少后多、先稀后浓、重视后期追肥的原则，追肥六次以上。苗高一——四寸时，施稀薄水肥二十——三十五担，硫酸铵五斤。苗高五——九寸时，除施稀水肥二十——四十担，硫酸铵七——十五斤外，还用土肥四十担复盖，防止肥份流失。苗高一、二尺时，每亩施水肥四十——六十担，硫酸铵十——二十斤，土肥一百——一百八十担，草木灰二百斤。这时施用较多土肥除有防止肥份流失作用外，还有培土、防止土壤板结及麻株倒伏的作用。苗高三、四尺时，施水肥三十担，硫酸铵十——二十五斤，硫酸钾二十五斤（或草灰二百斤）。株高五、六尺时，施硫酸铵十五——三十斤（或饼肥一百——一百五十斤）。株高七、八尺时，还施硫酸铵二十——四十斤。从以上麻株生长各阶段的施肥量看来，株高一、二尺以后，需要追施大量肥料，供应麻株迅速生长的需要。黄麻生长后期，株高七、八尺以后，仍要根据麻株生长情况追施肥料，以供应麻皮加厚及麻株上长的需要。
    深耕一尺到一尺半
    黄麻是深根作物，主根入土可达三尺以上。土壤深耕以后，耕作层加深，促进根系发达，植株生长健壮，麻皮产量增加。福建省南安县红色人民公社洪西大队，1958年的四点五五亩丰产地，由于深耕结合了施肥，亩产麻皮二千一百二十八斤，较未经深耕的四十一点一五亩黄麻每亩多产六百四十四斤。此外，按浙江省萧山县宇宙红人民公社的经验，深耕还有防止麻株倒伏的作用。黄麻种子小，如整地不良，不仅容易形成出土不齐的缺苗断垅现象，还易产生笨麻，影响产量。根据1958年丰产田的深耕经验，深耕一尺至一尺半，结合其他栽培措施，就能获得大面积增产。
    选用良种
    1958年黄麻栽培经验证明，选用良种也是增产的一项有效措施。如D154、红铁骨麻及竹秆麻都是当地比较好的良种，这三个品种比当地其他品种一般增产10％至30％。根据过去黄麻品种区域试验结果，D154及新选一号两个品种在江苏、福建、江西、湖北、广东及广西地区，表现良好，一般比其他品种增产3.9％—38.8％；新丰、吉口、白莲芝及翠绿四个黄麻品种在浙江麻区增产10％。
    黄麻系短日照作物，较南地区种子移往较北地区种植，生长期延长，植株高大，麻皮厚，纤维产量显著增高。以上说明1959年的丰产麻田，除应选用适于当地栽培的良种如D154、新选一号及青皮荚麻等外，同时还可由较南地区引进种子在较北地区种植，以取得增产效果。
    适期早播
    黄麻发芽要求温度较高，最低发芽温度一般圆果种为十五度，长果种为十八度。如播种过早，不仅出苗不整齐，出苗后麻苗容易遭受冻害而死亡，或生长不良，形成缺苗断垅，同时还易引起早花现象；播种过迟，生长期缩短，植株矮，麻皮薄，产量减低。广东潮安亭光社根据对不同播种期的麻田的观察，清明前七天播种比清明后十五天播种的麻皮产量高。根据1957年福建、浙江、广东等地丰产典型队的调查，1958年播种期均较往年提早十至十五天。这说明黄麻在适期内早播，延长生长期，能提高麻皮产量。
    圆果种黄麻的适宜播种期，长江流域地区在谷雨节前后，福建地区在清明谷雨间，广东、广西地区可在清明节前后。长果黄麻种子发芽温度要求较圆果种高，播种期应比圆果种推迟三至八天。
    防治病害，加强田间管理
    1958年的丰产麻田都注意到病虫防治及田间管理工作。在防治黄麻炭疽病方面，根据在福建南安县的调查，除播种前普遍采用了冷水温汤浸种及赛力散拌种处理外，还选用隔一年以上的地种植黄麻，同时普遍施用含钾素比较丰富的火烧土、草木灰及墙土作基肥追肥，并注意到黄麻生长期内的排水和麻田通风透光工作。由于采用了以上一系列综合防治措施，因而1958年炭疽病的为害较往年显著减轻。
    在田间管理方面，除做到早间苗、早定苗、多次间苗（三至四次）、及时移苗补苗和中耕除草（三至四次）外，还特别注意苗期排水及后期灌水技术问题。根据麻株生长及气候情况进行灌溉：黄麻幼苗期需水少，灌水时水流灌到沟底。麻株一、二尺高时需水较多，水灌到畦沟的一半。麻株三、四尺高以后，生长特别快，需水也特别多，灌水时灌到离畦面一寸处为宜，使水渗透全畦，不让淹没畦面，防止土壤板结。在黄麻生长中期的6、7月内，还要视天气进行灌水，北风干燥天，每隔二至三天灌水一次。南风潮湿天，每隔六至七天灌水一次。每次都要灌透灌匀。
