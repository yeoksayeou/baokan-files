Xinhua News Agency, March 7th, Washington dispatch: Certain figures within the American ruling clique have recently been stirring up war hysteria surrounding the Berlin issue. They are clamoring that the United States should take emergency preparedness measures to counter the Soviet Union's steps to end the occupation status of West Berlin.

On March 5th, U.S. President Eisenhower convened a "special meeting" of the National Security Council, followed by a meeting with congressional leaders from both parties on the 6th to study the Berlin issue and the German question. According to congressional leaders who attended the latter meeting, the United States' position on the Berlin issue will be "unyielding," but it will "keep" the "door open" for negotiations with the Soviet Union. Democratic leader Johnson clamored after the meeting that, in his view, the Berlin issue has "greatly increased" the "necessity" for the United States to be militarily prepared, and that he had discussed with Eisenhower the issue of "assembling" American military forces "as quickly as possible."

U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy also spread war sentiments when speaking to reporters on March 5th after attending the National Security Council meeting. According to him, the Pentagon is drafting many plans to cope with the Berlin situation, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are studying various possible "emergency situations." McElroy threatened that if a conflict broke out in Berlin, he thought it would be difficult to make the conflict a "limited war." He threatened that the United States would use ground forces to "keep the (West German) roads to West Berlin open," and that the United States believed it was free to use "any kind of atomic weapon."

Democratic Senator Dodd demanded in the Senate that a so-called "extremely urgent ninety-day plan" be formulated "to prepare the American people mentally to fight for Berlin."

However, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor recently testified before the Senate Disarmament Subcommittee that the United States has "no available capital" to use force on the Berlin issue at present. Speaking of the comparison of strength between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Taylor said, "According to intelligence, it is fair to say that the Soviets are currently leading in terms of intercontinental missiles."

    在柏林问题上煽风点火
    美官方人士散布战争言论
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团一些人士最近围绕柏林问题大肆煽动战争歇斯底里。他们叫嚷美国要采取紧急备战措施来反对苏联关于结束西柏林占领状态的步骤。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔5日召开了国家安全委员会“特别会议”，接着又在6日同国会两党领袖会晤，研究柏林问题和德国问题。据参加后一个会议的国会领袖说，美国在柏林问题上的立场将“寸步不让”，但是将“保留”同苏联谈判的“大门敞开”。民主党领袖约翰逊在会后叫嚣说，在他看来，柏林问题已经“大大增加了”美国在军事上作好准备的“必要性”，他已同艾森豪威尔讨论了“尽可能快地集结”美国军事力量的问题。
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊5日在参加国家安全委员会会议后对记者发表谈话时也大肆散布战争气氛。据他说，五角大楼正在起草许多应付柏林局势的计划，三军参谋长正在研究可能产生的各种“紧急状态”。麦克耳罗伊恫吓说，如果在柏林爆发冲突，他认为很难使这场冲突成为“有限战争”。他威胁说，美国将要使用地面部队来“使
  （西德）到西柏林的道路畅通”，并且说美国认为自己可以自由采用“任何种类的原子武器”。
    民主党参议员多德在参议院要求制订一项所谓“极为紧急的九十天计划”，“使美国的人民对于将为柏林而战有思想准备。”
    但是美国陆军参谋长泰勒最近在参议院裁军小组委员会上作证时说，美国在柏林问题上使用武力现在“还没有可用的任何本钱”。谈到美苏力量的对比时，泰勒说，“根据情报，如果说在洲际导弹方面苏联人目前领先，这是公平的说法”。
