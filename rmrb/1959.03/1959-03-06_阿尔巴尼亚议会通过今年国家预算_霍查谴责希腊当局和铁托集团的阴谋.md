Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 4th—The Albanian People's Assembly session, which opened on March 3rd, closed this afternoon.

    The session heard a report from Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labour Party, and unanimously approved the Albanian National Budget for 1959. According to the new budget, total revenue for this year is 27.4 billion leks, and total expenditure is 26.9 billion leks.
    At the March 4th session, a letter from the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to the Albanian People's Assembly on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany was read, and a resolution supporting the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany was adopted.
    The session also elected the new Supreme Court and approved a number of orders promulgated by the Presidium of the People's Assembly.
    At the March 3rd session, Finance Minister Verdi gave a report on the 1959 budget, emphasizing that the allocation for the national economy in 1959 would increase by 15% compared to 1958. The allocation for industrial development is 4.57 billion leks (compared to 3.9 billion leks in 1958). The allocation for agriculture has increased by 11% compared to last year.
    Hoxha delivered a speech at the March 3rd session. When talking about the domestic situation, he said that the 1958 national economic plan of the republic was completed by 101.6%. Industrial output increased by 20% compared to the previous year. Significant victories have also been achieved in the socialist transformation of agriculture. Currently, more than 62% of farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives. The cultivated land of agricultural cooperatives accounts for more than 76% of the country's total sown area.
    Hoxha emphasized that our strength lies in the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our Party and government consider it their sacred duty to constantly maintain and steadfastly strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union and the solidarity of all fraternal countries in the socialist family.
    Hoxha spoke about Albania's relations with its neighboring countries.
    Hoxha exposed the Greek authorities' ambitions for Albanian territory at the meeting. He said that the King of Greece and the reactionary chauvinists of Greece, in order to alleviate the Greek people's dissatisfaction with their betrayal of the Cypriot people, have put forward a disgraceful card coveting the southern territory of Albania. King Paul of Greece said at a recent banquet: "Since 1912, Greece has been watching the North Epirus issue, or the South Albania issue. This is a more important issue than the Cyprus issue." The King of Greece also incited the Greek public to say: "Forget about the Cyprus issue. In order to obtain South Albania, focus your attention on opposing Albania!"
    Hoxha said that it is clear that the King of Greece is engaging in an anti-Albanian "cold war" again, which echoes Tito's activities. Of course, this "cold war" waged by the King of Greece and American imperialism will be detested by the heroic Greek people and all progressive Greek public opinion, and will receive a proper response. Hoxha went on to say that we remind the Greek government that their recent actions will not only not achieve good results, but also will not benefit the people of both countries and will not benefit peace.
    Hoxha also said: We remind the Greek government that we have made many efforts in the past and will continue to dedicate ourselves to improving our relations.
    Hoxha then revealed that for a long time, Tito and the King of Greece had dreamed of encroaching upon Albanian territory. He said that at present, the Tito group has organized a frantic campaign against Albania, engaging in fabrications and slanders, as if Albanians are interfering in Yugoslavia's internal affairs.
    Hoxha said that we hope to have friendly neighborly relations with the Yugoslav state and should respect international regulations. However, Yugoslav activists, including Yugoslav diplomats in Tirana, do not respect this regulation and are undermining it. Our diplomats have never interfered in the internal affairs of other countries. We will never allow people wearing the cloak of diplomats to engage in interference in our internal affairs.
    Hoxha finally called on the Albanian working people to further develop their labor enthusiasm, further strengthen their unbreakable ties with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and make new efforts in the struggle for peace and friendship among all peoples.

    阿尔巴尼亚议会通过今年国家预算
    霍查谴责希腊当局和铁托集团的阴谋
    据新华社地拉那4日电　3日开幕的阿尔巴尼亚人民议会会议今天下午闭幕。
    会议听取了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委会员第一书记霍查的报告，一致通过了阿尔巴尼亚1959年国家预算。根据新预算，今年总收入为二百七十四亿里克，总支出为二百六十九亿里克。
    在4日的会议上宣读了德意志民主共和国人民议院就对德和约问题致阿尔巴尼亚人民议会的信，并且通过了一项支持及早缔结对德和约的决议。
    会议还选举了新的最高法院和批准了人民议会主席团所公布的一些命令。
    在3日会议上，财政部长维尔迪就1959年预算作了报告，他着重指出，1959年国民经济拨款比1958年增加15％。发展工业的拨款为四十五亿七千万里克（1958年这方面的拨款是三十九亿里克）。农业方面的拨款比去年增加11％。
    霍查在3日会上发表了演说。在谈到国内情况时，他说，1958年共和国国民经济计划完成了101.6％。工业产量比前一年增长了20％。在农业社会主义改造方面也获得重大胜利。目前有62％以上的农户参加了农业合作社。农业合作社的耕地占全国总播种面积的76％以上。
    霍查强调说，我们的力量在于以苏联为首的坚如磐石的社会主义阵营钢铁般的团结一致。我们党和政府认为，经常地保持和坚定不移地加强同苏联的友谊、社会主义大家庭的所有兄弟国家的团结，是自己的神圣职责。
    霍查谈到了阿尔巴尼亚同邻国的关系。
    霍查在会上揭露了希腊当局对阿尔巴尼亚领土的野心。他说，希腊国王和希腊反动的沙文主义者为了缓和希腊人民对他们背叛塞浦路斯人民的行为的不满，竟拿出了一张觊觎阿尔巴尼亚南部领土的可耻的纸牌。希腊国王保罗在最近一次宴会上说：“从1912年，希腊就注视北爱比尔问题或者叫做南阿尔巴尼亚问题。这是一个比塞浦路斯问题还重大的问题。”希腊国王还煽动希腊公众说：“把塞浦路斯问题忘了吧。为了取得南阿尔巴尼亚，把注意力集中到反对阿尔巴尼亚方面去吧！”
    霍查说，很明显，希腊国王又在搞反对阿尔巴尼亚的“冷战”了，这是在和铁托的活动相呼应。当然，这一个由希腊国王和美国帝国主义所搞的“冷战”将会遭到英雄的希腊人民和所有希腊进步的社会舆论的憎恶，也将会得到应有的回答。霍查接着说，我们提醒希腊政府，他们最近的这种行动不但不会获得好结果，而且无利于两国人民和无利于和平。
    霍查又说：我们提醒希腊政府，我们曾作了许多的努力，过去和将来都将致力于改善我们的关系。
    霍查接着揭露，很久以来，铁托和希腊国王就梦想侵吞阿尔巴尼亚领土。他说，目前，铁托集团对阿尔巴尼亚组织了疯狂的活动，进行捏造和诬蔑，好像阿尔巴尼亚人干涉南斯拉夫内政。
    霍查说，我们希望和南斯拉夫国家之间是友好的邻居，应当尊重国际法规。但是，南斯拉夫活动家们，包括南斯拉夫在地拉那的外交家们，并不尊重这一法规，而且正在破坏它。我们的外交官从没有干涉过别国的内政。我们任何时候也不允许披着外交官的外衣的人从事干涉我们的内政。
    霍查最后号召阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民进一步发挥劳动热情，进一步加强同苏联和其它社会主义国家的牢不可破的联系，在争取和平和各国人民之间的友谊的斗争中作出新的努力。
