Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The spring afforestation movement is progressing rapidly. As of the 4th, according to statistics from seventeen provinces and autonomous regions, including Hubei, Fujian, and Gansu, over 122 million mu of forest have been planted, and 9.3 billion trees have been planted around houses and villages. The average daily progress of afforestation nationwide has increased from 2.3 million mu in mid-February to 3.9 million mu, which is faster than the same period last year.

The main afforestation areas are still in the south. Since the beginning of the movement, the afforestation progress in Guangxi and Sichuan has been continuously and rapidly increasing, taking turns in leading the country. The afforestation area in both provinces and regions has exceeded 20 million mu. Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have also exceeded 10 million mu. In Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, 19 counties and cities have completed or overfulfilled their annual afforestation plans. Guizhou Province, which progressed faster last year but started later this year, is catching up recently. Before the end of the month, Yinjiang and Wuchuan counties in the province had completed this year's afforestation plan.

While the afforestation movement in the south continues to move forward, afforestation work in the north is also gradually unfolding. Following the North China Plain, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in the northwest have begun afforestation. As of the 4th, Gansu Province had afforested 1.69 million mu.

The people's communalization has created particularly favorable conditions for this year's afforestation work. Because the communes have more people, unified minds, and greater strength, and adopt the method of combining long-term arrangements with short-term assaults, some communes have achieved high speeds of planting tens of thousands of mu of forest in one day. Many large areas of barren mountains and wastelands, which were previously unable to be afforested, have been quickly planted with trees after the communes organized their forces to attack them. In Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, Lishang People's Commune still had more than 90,000 mu of barren mountains that had not been planted with trees during the agricultural cooperative period; after communalization, the trees were planted on these barren mountains in four days of concentrated effort this spring. Shuguang People's Commune in Jinhua County also created a record of planting more than 96,000 mu of forest in five days. The commune members also demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation in the afforestation movement. Some communes drew labor to help communes with more barren mountains and wastelands to afforest. Some communes supplied the best tree species and seedlings to communes lacking tree seedlings.

All localities have paid attention to the quality of afforestation this spring, and have generally implemented the system of guaranteeing planting, survival, and management, as well as grasping inspection, evaluation, and acceptance; for the fast-growing and high-yield forests that are the focus of construction, measures such as deep plowing, applying base fertilizer, and irrigation have been adopted. Fujian Province has established inspection teams in each key county and inspection groups in each commune. Shuangqiao People's Commune in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, organized inspection groups to inspect the quality of tree planting after planting, and divided the forest area into sections, assigning special personnel to be responsible for cultivation. Trees within the scope of the production team were the responsibility of the team, and scattered trees were managed by households. In addition, field management signs were established for forests, gardens, and sections, writing the names of the managers, the scope of management, tree names, number of plants, management measures, etc.

While afforesting, all localities are also seizing the season to cultivate seedlings, preparing seedlings for autumn and next year's afforestation. Guangdong Province has decided to minimize direct seeding afforestation this year, prioritizing meeting the needs of seedling cultivation with existing seeds in order to cultivate more and better seedlings and increase the proportion of afforestation. Shanxi Province has decided to implement the method of combining mass seedling cultivation with state-owned forest farm seedling cultivation, large-scale seedling cultivation and small-plot seedling cultivation, to vigorously cultivate seedlings. Jiangsu Province focused on promoting the experience of Jurong County in adopting asexual reproduction methods such as cuttings, grafting, and division of roots on a large scale to cultivate seedlings. As of the 4th, seventeen provinces and regions had cultivated a total of 698,000 mu of seedlings. (Attached pictures)

### 开展全民绿化运动逐步实现大地园林化  趁大好春光植树造林  十七省区今春已造林一亿二千万亩，四旁植树九十三亿株

    开展全民绿化运动逐步实现大地园林化
    趁大好春光植树造林
    十七省区今春已造林一亿二千万亩，四旁植树九十三亿株
    新华社8日讯　春季造林运动进展迅速，到4日为止，据湖北、福建、甘肃等十七个省、自治区的统计，已造林一亿二千二百多万亩，四旁植树九十三亿株。现在全国造林平均每日进度已由2月中旬的二百三十万亩上升到三百九十万亩，比去年同期快。
    目前主要造林地区仍是南方。从运动开始以来，广西、四川两地的造林进度都不断迅速上升，轮番在全国赢得领先地位。这两个省、区的造林面积都已超过两千万亩。湖南、安徽、江西三省也都已超过一千万亩。湖南、江西两省还各有十九个县、市已完成或超额完成全年造林计划。去年进度较快、但是今年动手较迟的贵州省，最近正在追赶上来。还在月底以前，这个省的印江、婺川两县就已完成今年造林计划。
    在南方造林运动继续向前发展的同时，北方造林工作也在逐步展开。继华北平原之后，西北的甘肃、陕西两省都已开始造林。甘肃省到4日为止，已造林一百六十九万亩。
    人民公社化给今年的造林工作创造了格外有利的条件。由于公社人多、心齐、力量大，和采取长安排、短突击相结合的办法，有些公社出现了一天造林几万亩的高速度。许多大面积荒山荒地，过去无力造林，现在经过公社组织力量突击，很快种上了树。浙江省淳安县里商人民公社在农业社时还有九万多亩荒山没有植树；公社化后，今春四天突击就在这些荒山上种了树。金华县曙光人民公社也创造了五天造林九万六千多亩的纪录。社员们在造林运动中还表现了共产主义大协作的精神，有的公社抽出劳力帮助荒山荒地多的公社造林。有的公社把最好的树种和苗木供给缺树苗的公社。
    各地今春都很注意造林质量，比较普遍地贯彻了包种、包活、包管理，和抓检查、抓评比、抓验收等制度；对于重点营造的速生丰产林，更采取了深翻土、施基肥、灌水等措施。福建省每个重点县都成立了检查团，每个公社都成立了检查小组。安徽省寿县双桥人民公社在栽树后组织检查组检查植树质量，并且将林区划片，指定专人负责抚育，属于生产队范围的树由队里负责，零星树木分户定人管理，果园包给懂园艺技术的社员管理；此外，又分林、分园、分段建立了地头管理牌，写上管理人的姓名、管理范围、树名、株数、管理措施等。
    各地在造林的同时，还抓紧季节培育树苗，为秋季和明年造林准备苗木。广东省决定今年尽量少搞直播造林，把现有种子尽先满足育苗需要，以便培育又多又好的苗木，增加植树造林比重。山西省决定实行群众育苗和国营林场育苗、大面积育苗和小畦育苗并举的办法，大力培育苗木。江苏省着重推广了句容县大规模采取扦插、嫁接、分根等无性繁殖育苗的经验。到4日为止，十七个省、区共已育苗六十九万八千亩。（附图片）
