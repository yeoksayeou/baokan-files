Xinhua News Agency, 19th. In order to adapt to the continued development and consolidation and improvement of education, various regions are taking active measures to deploy and train teachers, and vigorously solve the teacher problem.

    With the rise of industrial and agricultural production and the continuous development of education, China's teaching force is growing year by year. In 1957, the number of teachers in various schools increased by about 90% compared with the highest year before liberation, more than 1.7 times for middle schools, and more than three times for universities. However, it still cannot fully meet the needs. In 1958, education had greater development and needed more teachers. Therefore, teachers became a problem that urgently needed to be solved. In addition to the unified national distribution of normal school graduates and a portion of university graduates to solve part of the teacher problem, various regions also adopted a self-reliant approach to equip various levels of schools with the teachers they need. Under the leadership of the Party committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, a large number of cadres with high political quality and considerable cultural level were selected from government agencies and demobilized soldiers to serve as administrative leaders and teachers in schools, strengthen the Party's leadership in schools, and strengthen the teaching force. Thanks to the attention and leadership of Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province, from May to late December last year, more than 10,600 Party member leading cadres have been transferred to schools at all levels. Jiangsu Province has equipped newly built universities with more than 1,000 teachers, basically ensuring that each discipline has professional teachers. The province's agricultural middle schools already have a full-time and part-time teaching force of about 10,000 people. Guizhou, Shanxi and other provinces also directly grasped the deployment work by the Party committee, and in a short period of time dispatched thousands of cadres with higher quality suitable for education work to schools.

    Various regions, proceeding from long-term needs, also run various types of normal schools. Various regions have also greatly developed amateur normal education, organizing on-the-job teachers to study. In the autumn of 1958, Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, ran 41 amateur normal schools in 39 townships across the county, with more than 800 students learning and applying what they learned, improving teaching standards. Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, established normal schools in every commune, forming an amateur normal education system throughout the county, absorbing more than 5,000 teachers from primary and secondary schools and mass cultural and technical schools to study at the schools. Through lectures and specific research on political and professional courses, they solved specific problems encountered by teachers in teaching practice. Some counties in Henan, Sichuan and other provinces have established teacher training colleges and teacher Red and Expert schools. Under the leadership of the county party committee, they made comprehensive and unified arrangements for the political, cultural, and professional studies of in-service teachers, so that teachers have fixed time and organization for learning. Some also organize teachers to take short-term leave from work for study on a rotational basis. Normal colleges and universities and some secondary normal schools in various regions also run correspondence courses, sending teachers to conduct regular itinerant lectures, and systematically helping in-service teachers improve. In October last year, 18 counties in the Gannan Administrative Region of Jiangxi Province popularized correspondence normal education, and with the direct leadership of the county and township Party committees, established 19 correspondence normal schools of various types, and more than 95% of primary school teachers participated in the study.

    In the leap forward of education in 1958, full-time and part-time normal education in various regions also developed rapidly. Most of the special districts across the country successively established normal colleges, and counties established normal schools. Now, the number of secondary normal schools in Hebei Province has increased more than twofold compared with 1957, and the number of students enrolled has increased by about onefold, basically achieving that every county has a normal school or normal class. Some places have also expanded some secondary normal schools with good foundations into normal colleges, and expanded the original normal colleges into normal institutes and normal universities, increasing departments and expanding enrollment quotas.

    Promoting the spirit of communist cooperation and mutual support is also a way to solve the teacher problem. Since the autumn of 1958, many schools established earlier with a good foundation have helped newly established brother schools in terms of manpower, and areas with better teacher conditions have supported areas with poor conditions. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region started from scratch to run universities, and received support in terms of teachers from five universities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shaanxi. Some schools have improved their working methods, brought into play the potential of teachers, and supported brother schools. Hebei Agricultural University has made every effort to support the newly established agricultural colleges in five counties in the province. The relevant departments have sent teachers to these schools to conduct itinerant lectures to help the newly established schools solve the difficulties of insufficient teachers and lack of experience. In Shandong and other provinces, some schools with poor rural conditions are linked with schools with better urban conditions, and teachers are exchanged regularly using the "study abroad" method. Some normal schools in Nanjing, Nanning, Jinan and other places send graduating students and some senior students still in school to the counties to run teacher training classes in combination with internships to help relevant areas train and cultivate teachers. Some higher normal colleges and universities in Wuhan and Nanjing also accept the entrustment of the Party committee and open training classes in the schools to train teachers. Some schools are also linked with scientific research institutions, technical units, and medical and health departments, and the scientific and technical personnel of these units serve as part-time teachers of some professional courses. More cooperation is in business guidance. Generally, counseling networks are established with the original public schools as the center. Old schools counsel new schools, public schools counsel private schools, and old teachers counsel new teachers. Some special districts and counties in Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have specially organized teaching lecturer groups to set up points in different areas, conduct itinerant lectures, and help agricultural middle schools improve the quality of their teachers by means of delivery to the door.

    At present, some places still lack teachers considerably because the original schools are being expanded and new schools are being built. Party committees in various regions are actively taking measures to solve this problem by every possible means, proceeding from current needs and long-term needs.

    千方百计解决师资问题
    各地采取积极措施调配和培养教师
    新华社19日讯　为了适应教育事业的继续发展和巩固提高，各地采取积极措施调配培养教师，大力解决师资问题。
    随着工农业生产上升，教育事业不断发展，我国教师队伍正在逐年壮大。1957年各类学校教师人数和解放前最高年份相比，小学增加90％左右，中学增加一点七倍多，高等学校增加三倍多，但仍不能充分满足需要。1958年，教育事业有更大的发展，需要的教师人数更多，因此师资成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。各地除了由全国统一分配的师范学校毕业生和一部分高等学校毕业生解决一部分师资外，还采取自力更生的办法，为各类各级学校配备所需要的教师。各省、市、自治区在党委领导下，从机关、复员军人当中挑选了一大批政治质量较高并具有相当文化水平的干部，到学校中分别担任行政领导和教师等职务，加强学校中党的领导，增强教师队伍。安徽省由于各级党委的重视和领导，从去年5月到12月下旬，调到各级学校的党员领导干部已有一万零六百多人。江苏省为新建的高等学校配备了一千多名教师，基本上做到各学科有专业的教师，全省农业中学已拥有一支约一万人的专职和兼职教师队伍。贵州、山西等省，也由党委直接抓调配工作，在短期间内分别把成千的质量较高适宜于做教育工作的干部派到学校中去。
    各地还从长远需要出发，举办各种类型的师范学校。各地还大大地发展了组织在职教师学习的业余师范教育。四川省叙永县在1958年秋季前后，全县三十九个乡办起四十一所业余师范学校，有八百多名学员边学边用，提高教学水平。江苏省昆山县社社办师范，全县形成一个业余师范教育体系，吸收中、小学和群众文化技术学校教师等五千多人在校学习，通过政治和业务等课程的讲授和具体研究，解决教师在教学实践中所遇到的具体问题。河南、四川等省有些县成立教师进修学院、教师红专学校，在县委领导下对在职教师政治、文化、业务学习作出全面统一的安排，使教师学习有固定的时间和组织，有的还组织教师轮流作短期脱产的学习。各地师范院校、部分中等师范学校还举办函授班，派教师出去定期巡回讲学，有计划地帮助在职教师提高，江西省赣南行政区十八个县已在去年10月份普及了函授师范教育，在县、乡党委直接领导下办起各种函授师范学校十九所，95％以上的小学教师参加了学习。
    在1958年教育事业跃进中，各地全日制和半日制的师范教育也飞速发展，全国绝大多数的专区陆续建立师范专科学校，县成立师范学校。现在河北省的中等师范学校比1957年增加两倍多，在校学生人数增加了一倍左右，基本上达到县县有师范学校或师范班。有些地方还把一些基础好的中等师范学校扩充为师范专科学校，把原来的师范专科学校扩建为师范学院、师范大学，增加了科系，扩大了招生名额。
    发扬共产主义协作精神，互相支援，也是解决师资问题的一个办法。自1958年秋季以来，许多成立较早基础较好的学校，在人力上帮助新办的兄弟学校，师资条件较好的地区支援条件较差的地区。宁夏回族自治区白手起家兴办高等学校，在师资方面得到北京、上海、陕西等地五个高等学校的支援。有些学校改进工作方法，发挥师资潜力，支援兄弟学校。河北农业大学对省内五个县新成立的农业院校都尽力支援，由有关系科派教师到这些学校进行巡回讲学，帮助新办学校解决师资不足和经验不够的困难。在山东等省，有些乡村条件较差的学校和城市条件较好的学校挂钩，用“留学”的办法定期交换教师。南京、南宁、济南等地有的师范学校，派毕业班学生和部分在校高年级学生到县里，结合实习开办师资训练班，帮助有关地区训练培养师资。武汉、南京有的高等师范院校还接受党委委托，在学校内开设训练班，训练教师。还有一些学校和科学机关、技术单位、医药卫生部门挂钩，由这些单位的科学技术人员兼任一部分专业课程。协作当中更多的是业务上的辅导，各地一般以原有的公立学校为中心建立辅导网，老校辅导新校，公立学校辅导民办学校，老教师辅导新教师。安徽、江苏等省有些专区、县专门组织教学讲师团，分片设点，巡回讲学，用送上门的办法帮助农业中学提高师资质量。
    目前，有些地方由于原有的学校在扩建，新的学校在兴建，师资仍然相当缺乏。各地党委正在积极地采取措施，千方百计，从目前需要和长远需要出发，大力解决这个问题。
