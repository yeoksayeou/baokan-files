Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Ministry of Forestry recently issued instructions on actively developing the hunting industry.

The instructions stated that China is extremely rich in wildlife resources. In 1957, China produced more than 22 million fur pelts and many valuable animal medicinal materials, as well as a large amount of bird and animal meat. The development of the hunting industry not only supports national construction, supplies the needs of people's lives and healthcare, but also increases the income of mountain people and prospers the mountain economy. In order to better promote the development of this cause, the Ministry of Forestry instructed the agricultural and forestry departments and forestry departments (bureaus) of all provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions to grasp the resources and growth conditions of birds and animals with economic value, hunt them in a planned way, and make full use of them; at the same time, they should encourage hunters to vigorously kill birds and animals that are harmful to humans, livestock, and agricultural and forestry crops in the spirit of eradicating the four pests. Forestry systems and eligible people's communes can also establish animal farms to raise wild animals with a wide range of uses and high economic value, such as deer, mink, fox, otter, raccoon, and so on.

The instructions pointed out: Rare and precious birds and animals are of great significance in China's historical relics, so they must be protected. For example, pandas, golden monkeys, gibbons, Northeast tigers, and sika deer can be captured alive in part for scientific research, cultural exchange or breeding, and cannot be slaughtered arbitrarily. Birds and animals with high economic value, wide uses, and those beneficial to agriculture and forestry should also be protected. Do not capture them alive or hunt them during the breeding season. Several temporary hunting ban areas can be designated to prohibit the hunting of certain or all birds and animals within a certain period of time to facilitate reproduction. Areas with suitable conditions can choose appropriate locations to be designated as nature reserves, prohibit hunting, establish scientific research institutions, and conduct scientific research on birds and animals and hunting. The introduction of certain wild animals should be promoted.

    林业部指示
    积极开展狩猎事业
    据新华社28日讯　林业部最近发出了关于积极开展狩猎事业的指示。
    指示中说，我国野生动物资源极为丰富，在1957年，我国就生产了毛皮二千二百余万张和许多贵重的动物药材，以及大量的鸟兽肉。狩猎事业的发展，不仅支援了国家建设，供应了人民生活及保健的需要，并且增加了山区群众的收入，繁荣了山区经济。为了更好地推动这一事业的开展，林业部指示各省、市、自治区农林厅、林业厅（局）对有经济价值的鸟兽，应掌握资源和生长情况，有计划地猎取，充分利用；同时应鼓励猎民以根除四害的精神，大力捕杀对人畜和农林作物有害的鸟兽。林业系统和有条件的人民公社还可以建立养兽场，饲养用途广、经济价值高的野生动物，如鹿、貂、狐、水獭、貉子等等。
    指示指出：稀有的珍贵鸟兽在我国历史文物中具有重要意义，因此必须加以保护，如熊猫、金丝猴、长臂猿、东北虎、梅花鹿等，可以活捉一部分供科学研究、文化交流或饲养，不可任意捕杀。对经济价值高、用途广以及对农林有益的鸟兽，也应加以保护，在繁殖期间不要活捉，更不要猎杀，可以划定若干个临时禁猎区，在一定时间内禁止猎取某些或所有鸟兽，以利繁殖。有条件的地区可以选择适当地点，划为自然保护区，禁止狩猎，建立科学研究机构，进行鸟兽与狩猎的科学研究工作。对某些野兽应提倡引种。
