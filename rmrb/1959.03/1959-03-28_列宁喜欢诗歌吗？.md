    Does Lenin Like Poetry?

    The March issue of "Poetry Magazine" published an article written by Comrade Ge Baoquan: "Lenin and Poetry."

    Whether our revolutionary teacher Lenin liked poetry is indeed a very interesting question. Perhaps some readers might think that Lenin did not like poetry, because Lenin himself said that he was "an amateur in this regard" and "even if you skinned me alive, I couldn't write two lines of poetry." But the fact is not so. The article "Lenin and Poetry" tells us that Lenin not only loved poetry throughout his life, but also had his own unique insights into poetry.

    Lenin's mother, Maria Alexandrovna, was very fond of music. She could sing many old songs and lyrical songs, and she played the piano well. Therefore, Lenin liked to sing since he was a child, and he maintained his love for music throughout his life. Lenin's love for music was linked to his love for poetry. Lenin had liked the poems of Pushkin, Lermontov, and Nekrasov since childhood, and even when he was exiled to Siberia, he still kept their poems by his bedside, and he would repeatedly read them again and again at night.

    Lenin not only liked to sing, but also had his own unique style in singing. According to Lenin's brother, Dmitry Ilyich, "I have hardly ever heard Vladimir Ilyich sing songs that were depressed or melancholic. His singing was always full of courage, fearlessness, passion, and appeal." In 1889, Lenin was one of the first in Russia to sing "The Internationale." He attached great importance to "The Internationale." In 1913, on the 25th anniversary of the death of Eugène Pottier, the author of "The Internationale," Lenin specially wrote a commemorative article.

    Lenin repeatedly cared about the development of Soviet poetry. He had high evaluations of Demyan Bedny and Mayakovsky. He emphasized more than once that Demyan Bedny's works had a great mobilizing effect.

    Lenin loved poetry and music, first and foremost because he valued their political and ideological nature, and regarded them as weapons for carrying out revolutionary struggles and propagating socialist ideas.

    列宁喜欢诗歌吗？
    3月号的“诗刊”上，发表了戈宝权同志写的一篇文章：“列宁与诗歌”。
    关于我们的革命导师列宁是不是喜欢诗歌，这的确是一个很有趣的问题。也许有的读者会以为列宁是不喜欢诗歌的，因为列宁自己说过“在这方面是外行”、“即使剥掉我的皮，我也写不出两行诗来”。但事实并不是这样。“列宁与诗歌”一文告诉我们：列宁在他的一生中不仅热爱诗歌，而且对于诗歌还有他的独特的见解。
    列宁的母亲玛丽亚·亚历山德罗夫娜是非常喜欢音乐的，她能唱许多古老的歌曲和抒情歌，并且弹得一手好钢琴。所以，列宁从小就喜欢唱歌，在他的一生中都保持着对音乐的爱好。列宁对音乐的爱好和他对诗歌的爱好是连在一起的。列宁从童年时代就非常喜欢普希金、莱蒙托夫和涅克拉索夫等人的诗，甚至在他被流放到西伯利亚的时候仍然把他们的诗放在自己的床边，到了晚上就拿出来再三反复地读。
    列宁不但喜欢唱歌，而且在唱歌方面有他独特的地方。据列宁的弟弟德米特里·伊里奇说：“我几乎从来没有听过弗拉基米尔·伊里奇唱消沉、忧郁的曲子，他的歌声永远充满着勇敢、无畏、激昂和号召力。”在1889年，列宁在俄国最早唱起了“国际歌”。他对“国际歌”是非常重视的，1913年“国际歌”的作者艾任·鲍狄埃逝世二十五周年时，列宁还特地写了纪念文章。
    列宁一再关心着苏联诗歌的发展。他对杰米扬·别德内依和马雅可夫斯基都有过很高的评价。他不止一次地强调过杰米扬·别德内依的作品有极大的鼓动作用。
    列宁热爱诗歌和音乐，首先是重视它们的政治思想性，把它们作为一个进行革命斗争、宣传社会主义思想的武器。
