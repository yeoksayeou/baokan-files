Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 10th: The Politburo of the French Communist Party issued a statement today analyzing the results of the municipal elections held on Sunday.

    The statement pointed out that the movement against undemocratic policies, poverty, and war, which has been unfolding since June 1st of last year, has achieved a significant victory. The French Communist Party has made universal progress in the election. In urban centers, especially in Paris and Seine Department, the votes received by the Communist Party reached the highest percentage since the liberation; the workers clearly expressed their trust in the policies of the French Communist Party and agreed to adopt a united strategy with the French Communist Party to oppose the reactionaries and fascism.

    In this election, the extreme reactionaries suffered a clear setback. The Union for the New Republic encountered a serious defeat, as did the Independent Party. The Popular Republican Movement only maintained its position in the east and west by openly colluding with the Union for the New Republic. The position of the Socialist Party was weakened in this election, which is a sanction against its collusion with the reactionaries and the power-hungry individuals.

    The statement said: Our party is pleased that many Socialists decided to fight the reactionaries with us, ignoring the instructions of Mollet (General Secretary of the Socialist Party) to form an alliance with the Union for the New Republic and the most vile reactionaries.

    The statement also pointed out that the current task of the Communist Party is to maximize the various new possibilities in the second round of voting, to unite with Republicans to further defeat the reactionaries.

    The statement concluded: At present, it is necessary to systematically recruit new members to strengthen the party organization. We should resolutely lead the masses of the people against the great tide of big business and policies of individual autocracy by adopting bold united policies, in order to strive for bread, national independence, peace, and freedom.

    法共政治局就市政选举结果发表声明
    法共在反击反动逆流斗争中大胜
    在巴黎和塞纳省所获选票达到十多年来最大百分比
    新华社巴黎10日电　法国共产党政治局今天发表声明，分析了星期天举行的市政选举的结果。
    声明指出，从去年6月1日以来展开的反对不民主、贫困和战争政策的运动获得了重大的胜利。法国共产党在选举中获得了普遍的进展。在城市中心，特别是在巴黎和塞纳省，共产党所得到的选票达到了自解放以来最大的百分比；劳动者明显地表示了他们对法国共产党政策的信任，同意同法国共产党采取联合一致的策略以反对反动派和法西斯主义。
    在这次选举中，极端反动派受到了明显的挫折。保卫新共和联盟遇到严重失败，独立党人也是如此。人民共和党，只是在公然和保卫新共和联盟勾结的情况下，才在东部和西部维持住了自己的地位。社会党的地位在这次选举中削弱了，这是对它同反动派和个人当权狼狈为奸的一种制裁。
    声明说：我们党对很多社会党人决定和我们一起对反动派进行斗争感到高兴，这些社会党人没有理睬摩勒（社会党总书记）要他们同保卫新共和联盟和最恶劣的反动派结成联盟的指示。
    声明还指出，共产党目前的任务是，在第二轮投票中，最大限度地利用各种新的可能性，同共和人士联合起来进一步挫败反动派。
    声明最后说：目前，必须有计划地吸收新党员以加强党的组织，应该坚决地通过采取大胆的联合政策来领导人民群众反对大企业和个人专权政策的巨大逆流，以争取面包、争取民族独立、争取和平和自由。
