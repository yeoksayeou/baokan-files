    Notes
    Coward
    Recently, a farce unprecedented in history was staged in West Germany.
    On March 3, a group of judges in black robes from the Dortmund Municipal Political Criminal Court of the West German High Court ascended the judge's bench with solemn faces. The "trial" began. The defendant was brought in. Unexpectedly, the defendant was neither a communist nor a West German patriot, but one hundred and fifty thousand letters from the people of the German Democratic Republic supporting the struggle of the residents of Dortmund against the stationing of the British missile battalion in the city. These letters were intercepted by West German government intelligence personnel in the post office.
    The court conducted a "trial" of these 150,000 letters, and finally a judge read out a lengthy judgment, sentencing these letters to the "extreme penalty" - incineration.
    Do not think that these West German judges are suffering from mental illness, or that they are bored and have nothing to do. In these hundreds of thousands of letters are steeped the ardent common fighting spirit of the people of both East and West Germany. It is precisely this fighting spirit that makes the West German militarist executioners rush to severely suppress these letters as well.

    怯懦者
    最近在西德演出了一幕史无前例的丑剧。
    3月3日，西德高等法院多特蒙德市政治刑庭的一群穿着黑色长袍的法官，扳起庄严的脸孔走上了法官席。“审讯”开始了。传上了被告。出乎意外的，这个被告既不是共产党员，也不是西德的爱国人士，而是德意志民主共和国人民支援多特蒙德市居民反对英国导弹营进驻该市的斗争的十五万封信件。这些信件是西德政府情报人员在邮局中截获的。
    法庭对这十五万封信件进行了“审讯”，最后由一位法官宣读了洋洋的判决书，宣判这些信件处以“极刑”——焚毁。
    不要以为这些西德的法官患了神经病，或是因为他们闲得发慌。在这十多万封信件中浸透着德国东西两部分人民炙热的共同斗志。正是这种斗志，使得西德军国主义刽子手们慌忙地对这些信件也加以严厉的镇压。
