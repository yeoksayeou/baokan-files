Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 3rd: At the first joint prevention conference of six provinces (cities) in China for eliminating crop pests and diseases, held in Xi'an, the Joint Prevention Committee of the Joint Prevention Zone for Eliminating Crop Pests and Diseases in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Beijing was formally established. A joint prevention plan for 1959 was formulated, requiring the six provinces (cities) to comprehensively eliminate and focus on eradicating the main pests and diseases of major crops such as wheat, cotton, corn, potatoes, oil crops, and vegetables this year, ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. The meeting decided that, from now on, a high tide of eliminating wheat rust and other overwintering pests and diseases should be launched immediately in each province (city) of the joint prevention zone; it should be ensured that information is shared, mutual supervision is carried out, joint annihilation is conducted, and comprehensive encirclement is implemented.

    The meeting seriously studied the current prevention and control work of wheat rust, and unanimously passed a resolution focusing on eliminating wheat rust and overwintering pests and diseases, ensuring a fierce attack on wheat rust and successfully passing the two key stages of wheat returning to green and jointing. The resolution requires that each province (city) in the joint prevention zone must seize the current favorable period, take the initiative, thoroughly eliminate the disease transmission center, use powder to seal off areas, and comprehensively protect crops to prevent the spread of harm. The meeting also drafted a technical measure to prevent wheat rust.

    The main crops of these six provinces (cities) (wheat, cotton, corn, millet, potatoes, etc.) are roughly the same, and the pests and diseases are similar. Often, when pests and diseases occur in one province, they will spread to other provinces. Therefore, on the basis of the pest control experience of each province (city) last year, the six provinces (cities) jointly consulted and decided to form a pest and disease joint prevention zone. This connects the vast cultivated land of more than 490 million mu into one piece, unifies steps, and comprehensively prevents and controls, and comprehensively eliminates.

    The joint prevention plan stipulates that the joint prevention zone requires the resolute elimination of rust, wheat blossom midges, cotton aphids, spider mites, blind bugs, pink bollworms, corn borers, sweet potato black rot, and rapeseed flea beetles throughout the year. The division of labor is: Shaanxi for wheat, Henan for cotton, Shanxi for corn, Hebei for potatoes, Shandong for oil crops, and Beijing for vegetables. The plan stipulates that each province (city) must formulate prevention and control measures in accordance with the division of labor, and regularly grasp relevant information, and be responsible for summarizing the experience of single prevention and control at the end of the year.

    In order to make the joint prevention work more timely and in-depth, the joint prevention plan stipulates that five small inter-regional joint prevention zones will be established in the adjacent areas of the six provinces (cities) and in large and medium-sized cities. These five joint prevention zones are: Handan and Xinxiang Joint Prevention Zone; Kaifeng and Jining Joint Prevention Zone; Liaocheng, Zibo, Handan, and Tianjin Joint Prevention Zone; Zhangjiakou, Northern Shanxi, Yulin, and Yan'an Joint Prevention Zone; Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Datong, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xi'an, and Baoji Joint Prevention Zone. The meeting requested that these joint prevention zones convene meetings quickly after this meeting to establish joint prevention organizations and take active prevention and control measures to ensure the smooth completion of the above tasks.

    The joint prevention plan also stipulates that two joint large-scale inspections will be organized throughout the year. The first will begin in late March, and the inspection content will include the prevention and control of wheat rust, overwintering pests and diseases, and sweet potato black rot, as well as the preparation of pesticides and machinery. The second will begin in mid-July, and the inspection content will include the prevention and control of pests and diseases in cotton fields and various autumn crops.

    In response to the situation reported by various places at the meeting, the meeting also focused on analyzing the situation of pests and diseases this year. The meeting believes that the prevention and control work of pests and diseases before winter was generally more in-depth and meticulous than in previous years. Each province (city) has successively held plant protection conferences, established organizations for preventing and controlling pests and diseases from top to bottom, and strengthened forecasting and early warning work. These are all favorable conditions, but we must not be complacent and satisfied because of this. Especially because the weather was warm, the temperature was high, the rainfall was abundant, and the humidity was high last winter, the mortality rate of overwintering pests and diseases was low. Since the beginning of spring, pests and diseases have gradually increased, and the onset period has also been earlier than in previous years. If prevention and control are not strengthened, unnecessary losses may be suffered.

    During the meeting, the six provinces and cities fully exchanged pest information and prevention and control experience, and successively visited the on-site situation of Xingping County and the suburbs of Xi'an City in preventing and controlling wheat stripe rust. Everyone unanimously reflected that the method used by Shaanxi Province to prevent and control wheat stripe rust by burying soil and cutting leaves and removing wheat leaves is very good and worth learning from other provinces.

    This meeting lasted six days and ended in Xi'an on the 3rd. (Han Guoying)

    六省市组织联防
    全面围剿病虫害
    据新华社西安3日电　在西安举行的我国第一次六省（市）消灭农作物病虫害联防会议上，正式成立了晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕、北京消灭农作物病虫害联防区联防委员会，制订了1959年联防方案，要求六省
  （市）在今年内对于小麦、棉花、玉米、薯类、油料、蔬菜等主要作物的主要病虫害，做到全面消灭，重点肃清，确保农业大丰收。会议决定从现在起在联防区各省（市）立即掀起一个扑灭小麦锈病和其它越冬病虫害的高潮；保证做到互通情报，互相督促，联合围歼，全面包剿。
    会议认真研究了当前小麦锈病的防治工作，一致通过一项消灭小麦锈病和越冬病虫为中心的决议，保证狠狠地打击小麦锈病，过好小麦返青和拔节两关。决议要求联防区各省（市）必须抓紧当前有利时期，争取主动，彻底消灭传病中心，喷粉封锁，全面保护，不使传播为害。会议还拟定了一项防止小麦锈病的技术措施。
    这六个省（市）的主要农作物
  （小麦、棉花、玉米、谷子、薯类等）大致相同，病虫为害相近。往往一省发生病虫，就会流传他省。为此，六个省（市）在去年各省
  （市）防虫经验的基础上，共同协商，决定组成病虫害联防区。这样就把四亿九千多万亩广阔的耕地连成一片，统一了步调，全面防治，全面消灭。
    联防方案规定：联防区要求全年坚决消灭锈病、吸浆虫、棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象、红铃虫、玉米螟、甘薯黑斑病和油菜芜青叶蜂等病虫害。专业分工是：陕西为小麦，河南为棉花，山西为玉米，河北为薯类，山东为油料作物，北京市为蔬菜。方案中规定：各省（市）必须按照分工订出防治措施，并经常掌握有关情况，年终负责进行单项防治经验的总结。
    为了使联防工作做得更加及时和深入，联防方案规定在六省（市）毗邻地区和大、中城市再设立五个地区间的小联防区。这五个联防区是：邯郸、新乡联防区；开封、济宁联防区；聊城、淄博、邯郸、天津联防区；张家口、晋北、榆林、延安联防区；北京、天津、保定、石家庄、邯郸、济南、青岛、太原、大同、郑州、开封、西安、宝鸡联防区。会议要求这些联防区在这次会议结束后，迅速召集会议，成立联防组织，采取积极的防治措施，保证上述任务顺利完成。
    联防方案还规定：全年组织两次联合大检查。第一次于3月下旬开始，检查内容包括小麦锈病、越冬病虫、甘薯黑斑病的防治工作和农药械准备工作等。第二次于7月中旬开始，检查内容包括棉田和各种秋田作物的病虫防治工作。
    针对会上各地汇报的情况，会议还着重分析了今年病虫害的情况。会议认为，冬前病虫害防治工作普遍较往年深入细致，各省（市）先后召开了植保会议，从上到下层层建立了防治病虫害的组织，加强了预测预报工作。这些都是有利条件，但是绝不能因此而麻痹自满。特别是因为去冬天气暖，温度高，雨量多，湿度大，越冬病虫害死亡率低。入春以来，病虫害已逐渐上升，发病期也较往年提前，如果不加强防治，很可能遭到不必要的损失。
    会议期间，六个省、市充分交流了病虫情报和防治经验，先后参观了兴平县和西安市郊区防治小麦条锈病的现场情况。大家一致反映：陕西省用埋土切叶和摘除麦叶防治小麦条锈病的方法很好，值得各省学习。
    这次会议历时六天，3日在西安结束。　（韩国英）
