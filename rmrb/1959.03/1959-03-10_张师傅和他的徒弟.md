    Master Zhang and His Apprentices
    Cheng Shizhong, Jixi Mining Machinery Factory, Heilongjiang
    Around eight or nine o'clock in the morning, as the night shift ended, Old Master Zhang led a large group of young men out of the workshop and towards the factory gate in a grand manner. He seemed particularly happy today, his face radiant as if he were a triumphant general. The young apprentices behind him also surrounded Old Master Zhang with smiles, constantly erupting into cheerful laughter.
    Why were they so happy?
    It turned out that there were a total of four craftsmen in Old Master Zhang's group, but only he had worked yesterday. One went to Beijing to visit the Industrial Exhibition, one was temporarily transferred due to urgent flask tasks, and another was sick with a bad cold and couldn't work. When Old Master Zhang entered the workshop at twelve o'clock last night and arrived at the work site, he couldn't help but frown. He looked at the dozen or so apprentices around him, all those pairs of youthful eyes focused on him alone. He didn't say a word for a long time, thinking seriously. Suddenly, he relaxed his brow and said with a smile, "Kids, come on, sit down. Let's have a pre-shift meeting first, how about it?"
      "Okay, let's have a meeting!" the young people replied in unison.
    "Your masters aren't here today, but these tasks still need to be completed. What do you think we should do? In my opinion, can you all be bold and try to do it yourselves? I'll provide guidance if you don't understand something. What do you say, do you have confidence?"
    Old Master Zhang looked at these young men with enthusiasm, and he was happy to see the surprise and excitement in their eyes.
      "We can do it, as long as Old Master Zhang provides guidance and corrections from time to time, we dare to do it," replied a young man who looked a little older and more capable.
      "That's great, this is the communist spirit of the working class, daring to think and daring to do. Let's make it a deal. Let's start taking action now."
    This night shift really kept him busy. Not only did he have to do an important job himself, but he also had to keep running back and forth, and answer many questions that seemed extremely simple but were so interesting. He was satisfied to see that although these little guys were a bit clumsy, they were still producing work, and some of the work was quite clean. He nodded from time to time, saying with an approving look:
  "That's right, do it like this, not bad at all."
    These young men were praised, and their energy increased. Their faces were flushed with excitement, and they worked harder and harder.
    Old Master Zhang looked at these lovely, energetic young men, each like a little tiger, and was happy from the bottom of his heart. He looked at his watch, it was half an hour before eight o'clock, the end of the shift, and the sky outside the window was already bright. He said, "Kids, stop working, let's call it a day. Take a look at our harvest tonight, it's not small, and it was all made by you apprentices. Okay, go back to sleep now, this day is enough to tire you out."
    As they were about to leave the workshop, a bright red poster was pasted in the most conspicuous place in the workshop, praising the creativity of these apprentices, and also praising Old Master Zhang, saying that he had created the experience of a rapid apprentice training method.

    张师傅和他的徒弟
    黑龙江鸡西矿山机械厂　成士忠
    早上八九点钟下夜班的时候，老张师傅领着一大帮青年小伙子浩浩荡荡地离开了车间朝着工厂大门走去。他今天显得特别高兴，好像一个旗开得胜的将军似的红光满脸；他身后的这些青年徒工也一个个嘻笑地围在老张师傅身边，不断地哄发出愉快的笑声。
    他们为什么这样高兴呢？
    原来，老张师傅这一小组一共有四个工匠，可是昨天却只有他一个人上了班，其他三个工匠，一个上北京参观工业展览会去了，一个因扣箱任务紧张，临时调了去，另一个却因为重感冒病了不能上班。当昨天半夜十二点钟上班的时候，老张师傅进了车间来到工地一看，眉头不禁皱了起来。他看着围在他身边的十几个徒弟，这十几对带着稚气的眼光都集中在他一个人身上。他半响没吭声，认真的思索了起来，可是突然他高兴地松开眉毛笑着说：“孩子们，来，都坐下来，咱们先来开个班前会吧，怎么样？”
      “好啊，开会吧！”这群年青人齐声回答说。
    “今天你们的师傅都没来，可是这些任务又不能不完成，你们看怎么办？依我看，你们大伙能不能自己大胆的动手干它一下，不明白的地方我来作指导，怎么样，有信心没有？”
    老张师傅热情地望着这些小伙子们，他高兴地看到从他们的眼睛里流露出来的惊喜而激奋的眼光。
      “我们能干，只要老张师傅随时指导纠正，咱们就敢干。”一个年纪显得较为大些，神气显得较精明能干的小伙子回答说。
      “那太好了，这才是工人阶级敢想敢干的共产主义风格，咱们就一言为定。现在马上就开始行动。”
    这一个夜班，可真是把他忙坏了，他不但自己要干着一个重要的活，又要不停地跑到这头，又跑到那头，而且又要回答好多看来是极其简单但又是那么有意思的问题。他满意的看到这些小家伙们虽然有些笨手笨脚，可是毕竟是干出活来了，而且有些活还干得挺干净呢，他不时的点头，带着赞扬的神色说：
  “对了，就这么干，一点也不错。”
    这些小伙子们受到了赞扬，劲头更大了，一个个兴高采烈的脸孔红通通的，愈干愈有劲。
    老张师傅望着这些可爱的生气勃勃的小伙子，一个个像个小老虎似的，从心里高兴。他看了看表，离八点下班还差半个小时，窗外的天已经大亮了，他说：“孩子们，别干了，现在收工吧，你们大伙看看咱们这一夜收获可不小呢，这是你们学徒做出来的。好了，现在马上回去睡觉，这一天够你们累的了。”
    在他们快要离开车间时，一张鲜红的大字报贴在车间最醒目的地方，表扬了这些学徒们的创造，并且还表扬了老张师傅，说他创造了快速培养学徒法的经验。
