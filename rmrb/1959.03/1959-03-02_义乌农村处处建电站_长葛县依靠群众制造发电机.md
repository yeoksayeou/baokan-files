Yiwu County in Zhejiang Province is launching a mass movement of the whole Party and all the people to run electricity.

Since late April of last year, the county has relied on the masses to build 43 small hydropower stations and hydraulic processing stations, with an installed capacity of 324 kilowatts. In winter, combined with the water conservancy construction movement, focusing on the five reservoir power stations of Yanjiang, Qiaoxi, Yi'an, and Dongfeng, and using the water drop of irrigation channels and the method of long vines bearing melons, reservoirs, ponds, streams, and channels are connected to build small power stations everywhere, forming a county-wide water conservancy and power grid.

The development of power stations throughout the county has brought great benefits to the development of people's commune industry, the improvement of agricultural production, and the convenience of commune members' lives. After the Yiting People's Commune built a 24-kilowatt hydropower station, it immediately established a large-scale electric grain processing plant. After one year of operation, this power station can increase the total industrial output value of the commune by eight times compared to the investment cost of the power station. At the same time, it can save more than 32,000 labor days in one year for other production. This year, while utilizing electric power for processing, it is planned to develop electric irrigation and electric cultivation. The commune members affectionately call the power station "night pearl" and "night light treasure."

In the mass electricity generation movement, Yiwu County, in addition to relying on the masses to raise funds themselves, also relied on the strength of the masses to run on-site training classes, training a large number of local engineers, and solving the shortage of technical manpower for station construction. In late April last year, after the masses of Qianshan Village, Yiting, built a small hydropower station in three days, the Yiwu County Party Committee immediately held a short-term training class on the spot with 147 people including township and commune cadres, mud and water workers, and carpenters, learning the basic knowledge and technical design of station construction, breaking the mysterious view of electricity generation. Now, according to incomplete statistics, there are basically more than 1,000 farmer technicians in the county who can master the survey, design, and construction of small hydropower stations.

In the mass electricity generation in Yiwu County, the policy of "small-scale as the main, production as the main, and commune-run as the main" was correctly implemented. At the same time, the experience of "small-scale hydropower stations in the plains" in Tianjin blooming in five days was absorbed, which accelerated the speed of building power stations and cost very little money.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 5th. Changge County in Henan Province relies on the masses and self-reliance to launch a county-wide mass upsurge in electricity generation.

From October last year to now, Changge County has manufactured 24 indigenous generators with a power generation capacity of 55 horsepower and has begun generating electricity. This year, the county strives to manufacture 400 indigenous generators with a power generation capacity of 15,000 horsepower.

When Changge County started manufacturing indigenous generators, there were no raw materials, no equipment, no tools, and no technicians. Many people believed that indigenous methods could not produce generators. Others believed that manufacturing indigenous generators was not useful and that it would be better to build large foreign generators in the future. The county party committee mobilized the masses to repeatedly discuss these opinions, criticized these right-leaning conservative ideas, and found ways to solve the difficulties.

The process of trial-producing indigenous generators is the process of overcoming difficulties. People use waste oil drums, waste iron kettles, and iron slag after heat treatment to replace silicon steel sheets; use scrap steel to make steel bars; draw steel wire to replace enameled wire; use silk to replace yellow wax cloth; use light bulbs to replace voltmeters; use wooden machine shells to replace cast iron machine shells, and so on. Many masses voluntarily donated materials and raised funds, and as a result, the generator was successfully trial-produced and of good quality. (Attached picture)

    义乌农村处处建电站
    长葛县依靠群众制造发电机
    本报讯　浙江义乌县，正在开展一个全党全民办电的群众运动。
    这个县自去年4月下旬开始，依靠群众办起小型水力发电站和水力加工站四十三处，装机容量三百二十四瓩。冬季全县结合兴修水利运动，以兴建的岩江、巧溪、遗安和东风等五个水库电站为主，利用灌溉渠道的跌水和以长藤结瓜的方法，做到库、塘、溪、渠相连，处处建筑小电站，从而形成一个全县性的水利电力网。
    全县电站的发展对发展人民公社工业、提高农业生产和便利社员生活带来了很大好处。义亭人民公社在建成了一座二十四瓩的水力发电站后，立即办起了规模较大的电力粮食加工厂。这座电站投入生产一年，就能使公社工业总产值比这座电站投资成本增长八倍，同时一年中还可以节约劳动力三万二千多个从事其他生产。今年在利用电力加工的同时，计划发展电力灌溉和电力耕作。社员们心爱地称电站是“夜明珠”、“夜光宝”。
    义乌县在全民办电运动中，除依靠群众自筹经费外，还依靠群众力量开办现场训练班，培养出大批土工程师，解决了建站技术力量的不足。去年4月下旬，义亭前山村群众三天办起一座小型水力发电站后，中共义乌县委立即就地举办了有乡、社干部和泥水、木工等一百四十七人参加的短期训练班，学会了建站的基本知识和技术设计，打破了办电的神秘观点。现在据不完全统计，全县基本上能掌握小型水力发电站的勘察、设计和施工的农民技术人员已有一千多人。
    义乌县在全民办电中，正确地贯彻了以“小型为主、生产为主、社办为主”的办电方针，同时吸收了天津“平原小型水电站”五天开花的经验，使大办电站的速度加快，而且花钱很少。

    本报讯　河南长葛县依靠群众，自力更生，掀起全县群众性办电的高潮。
    从去年10月到现在，长葛县已经制成土发电机二十四部，发电能力为五十五马力，并已开始发电。今年内，全县争取制造土发电机四百部，发电能力为一万五千马力。
    长葛县开始制造土发电机，没有原料，没有设备，没有工具，没有技术人员，许多人认为土法造不成发电机。还有人认为，制造土电机不顶事，不如将来搞大的洋电机。县委发动群众反复讨论这些意见，批判了这些右倾保守思想，并且找出了解决困难的办法。
    试制土电机的过程，就是克服困难的过程。人们用废油桶、废铁壶、铁渣等经过热处理，代替矽钢片；用废钢打钢条；拔钢丝代替漆包线；用丝绸代替黄腊布；用电灯泡代替电压表；用木制机壳代替铸铁机壳，等等。许多群众自动献材料，凑集资金，结果发电机试制成功了，而且质量良好。（附图片）
