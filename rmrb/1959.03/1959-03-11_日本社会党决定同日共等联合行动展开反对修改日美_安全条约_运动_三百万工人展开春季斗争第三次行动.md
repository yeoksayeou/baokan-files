Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party decided today to launch a powerful nationwide movement jointly with the Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and about 200 other mass organizations, to oppose the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

This is the first time in recent years that the Japanese Socialist Party has decided to take joint action with the Communist Party.

The Socialist Party's decision was made at a leadership cadre meeting chaired by Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki today. The meeting also decided to establish a national joint struggle organization – the "National Conference Against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

This joint struggle organization will include the Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the Japan Peace Committee, the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, and various sectors such as youth and women, totaling about 200 organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch, Tokyo: Approximately three million workers across Japan launched the third unified action of the spring struggle today.

In today's unified action, workers in various sectors such as coal mining, steel industry, shipbuilding industry, chemical industry, metal mining, postal and telecommunications, railways, and government officials carried out various forms of struggle such as strikes and workplace rallies. Five hundred thousand teachers held rallies in 15,000 schools across the country today to oppose the reactionary education policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Not only did many unions belonging to the powerful General Council of Trade Unions of Japan participate in today's unified action, but also some neutral unions that had previously acted independently. The scope of workers participating in the spring struggle is wider than in previous years.

In this year's spring struggle, Japanese workers not only demanded higher wages, the implementation of a national uniform minimum wage of 8,000 yen, and opposition to the government's illegal suppression of workers, but also put forward clear political goals such as crushing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The Joint Struggle Committee leading the spring struggle decided yesterday on a plan to launch the fourth and fifth unified actions, and also determined the policy of launching a movement to crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and restore Japan-China diplomatic relations.

The policy stipulates that before April, trade unions across the country should hold rallies, pass resolutions against revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, and should protest to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party on the issues of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and Japan-China relations.

The policy also stipulates that on April 15, workers across the country will hold workplace rallies against revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    日本社会党决定同日共等联合行动展开反对修改日美“安全条约”运动
    三百万工人展开春季斗争第三次行动
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天决定同日本共产党和日本工会总评议会等约二百个群众团体共同展开强大的全国性运动，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    这是最近几年来日本社会党第一次决定同共产党采取联合行动。
    社会党的这个决定是在今天由委员长铃木茂三郎主持的领导干部会议上作出的。这次会议还决定成立一个全国性联合斗争组织——“反对日美安全条约国民会议”。
    这个联合斗争组织将包括日本共产党、日本工会总评议会、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、日本拥护宪法国民联合会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、日本和平委员会、全日本农民协会联合会以及青年、妇女等各界共约二百个团体。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本全国各地共约三百万工人今天展开声势浩大的春季斗争第三次统一行动。
    在今天的统一行动中，煤矿工业、钢铁工业、造船工业、化学工业、金属矿业，邮电、铁道等各个部门的工人和政府机关的公务人员，分别进行了罢工、工作场所大会等各种方式的斗争。五十万教职员今天在全国一万五千所学校举行了大会，反对岸信介政府的反动教育政策。
    参加今天统一行动的不仅有强大的日本工会总评议会所属的许多工会，而且还有一些过去单独行动的中立性工会。参加春季斗争的工人的范围比往年更加广泛。
    日本工人在今年的春季斗争不仅要求提高工资、实行全国统一的八千日元最低工资制、反对政府非法镇压工人，而且提出了粉碎日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交、打倒岸信介内阁等鲜明的政治目标。
    领导春季斗争的联合斗争委员会在昨天决定了展开第四次和第五次统一行动的计划，同时还确定了展开粉碎日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交运动的方针。
    方针规定，在4月以前，全国各地工会要举行大会，通过反对修改日美“安全条约”和要求恢复日中邦交的决议，并且要就修改日美“安全条约”和日中关系问题向岸信介政府与自由民主党提出抗议。
    方针还规定，在4月15日，全国工人一齐举行反对修改日美“安全条约”的工作场所大会。
