    Factory Specialization Combined with Mass Movement
    Sichuan's Tool Reform Achieves Good Quality and Low Cost

    Chengdu, March 22nd (Our Dispatch) – Sichuan Province, in its tool reform, is implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," combining factory specialization with a vigorous mass movement. This constantly consolidates and improves the effectiveness of tool reform, guarantees specifications and quality, and reduces costs. Through this approach, the province plans to promote 20 million units of various new-style tools and 20 million sets of ball bearings this year, increasing labor productivity by more than 50% from the current level.

    Accelerating the pace of basic agricultural machinery construction and vigorously promoting the factory production of farm tools, as well as establishing specialized teams for manufacturing and repairing tools, are prominent features of the current upsurge of tool reform in Sichuan Province. At present, the province has newly built more than 10,600 farm tool factories and repair shops, manufactured more than 4,000 units of indigenous and modern machine tools, and more than 84,000 large-scale implements, laying a preliminary material foundation for tool reform and creating conditions for the upcoming agricultural mechanization and electrification. This year, the province will establish a relatively complete agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair network between the vast urban and rural areas, achieving the goal of "small repairs within the team, major repairs within the commune." The existing farm tool factories and repair shops are now being assigned production tasks level by level according to their equipment situation. This effectively guarantees the quality of products and their regular supply. Since October of last year, Lezhi County, relying on the county farm tool factory and the broad masses, has independently manufactured more than 230 machine tools and more than 6,000 large-scale implements, constructed and equipped 61 farm tool factories and more than 400 farm tool repair stations, basically establishing the county's farm tool manufacturing and repair network. To date, the county has created and improved 190 types of tools for agricultural production, of which 157 types, totaling 520,000 units, have been promoted. These generally improve efficiency several times over, saving a total of more than 40 million labor days.

    While accelerating the creation and production of various new-style farm tools and machinery equipment, the specialized teams in various regions also evaluate and standardize the tools invented by the masses, adopting those that are suitable, improving those that are basically suitable, and then drawing up blueprints for mass production and universal promotion. After tools are promoted, many county farm tool factories send technical personnel to the fields to understand their usage and provide technical guidance to commune members. This approach, which combines specialized teams and mass movements, not only solves the difficulty of insufficient technical strength but also accelerates the pace of the movement and improves the quality of tool reform. Leshan County, closely integrated with current production, relying on the technology of the farm tool factory's employees and the practice of the masses, has successfully created 20,000 units of new-style tools in the past two months.

    This year, Sichuan Province is implementing a complete set of measures for creation, production, use, management, repair, and modification in tool reform to ensure the implementation of the policy of "walking on two legs." This set of measures was summarized from the experience of the province's mass production and promotion of new-style tools last year. It advances the tool reform movement in a more detailed and solid direction from the production to the use of tools, overcoming the shortcomings of last year, such as more manufacturing, less promotion, and lack of improvement in popularization. At present, the tool production departments and user units in various parts of Sichuan are vigorously implementing this set of measures. Farm tool factories in various regions have already established or are establishing and improving product acceptance systems, ensuring that unqualified products are reworked, products of poor quality are not allowed to leave the factory, and tools leaving the factory are guaranteed for use, replacement, and repair.

### 工厂专业制造和群众运动相结合  四川工具改革质量好成本低

    工厂专业制造和群众运动相结合
    四川工具改革质量好成本低
    本报成都22日电　四川省在工具改革中贯彻两条腿走路的方针，使工厂专业制造和大搞群众运动相结合，不断地巩固、提高工具改革的成效，保证规格质量，降低成本。通过这一途径，全省要在今年内推广各种新式工具两千万件，滚珠轴承两千万套，把劳动生产率从现有基础上提高50％以上。
    加速农业机械基本建设的速度，大搞农具制造工厂化，建立制造、修配工具的专业队伍，是四川省今年工具改革高潮中的鲜明特点。现在全省已新建起了农具厂、修配厂一万零六百多个，制造了各种土、洋机床四千多台，大型机具八万四千多件，初步为工具改革奠定了物质基础，也为即将到来的农业机械化、电气化，创造了条件。今年，全省就要在广大的城乡之间建立起一个比较完整的农业机械制造修配网，实现社有农具厂、队有修配站。现有的农具厂、修配站，目前已按设备情况，逐级分工，安排生产。这样就切实地保证了产品的质量和产品的经常供应。乐至县从去年10月到现在，依靠县农具厂和广大群众，自力更生，制造出了二百三十多台机床和六千多件大型机具，建设和武装了六十一个农具厂，四百多个农具修配站，已经实现了农具小修不出队，大修不出社，基本上建成了全县的农具制造修配网。到现在为止，该县已为农业生产创制、改良了各种工具一百九十种，其中推广的一百五十七种五十二万件工具，一般都提高效率数倍，共节省劳力四千多万个。
    各地专业队伍在加紧创制和生产各种新式农具、机器设备的同时，还对群众发明创造的工具进行评比定型，适用的采用，基本适用的加以改进，然后绘出图纸，成批生产，普遍推广。许多县农具厂在工具推广以后，并派出技术人员深入田间，了解使用情况，对社员进行技术辅导，这种把专业队伍和群众运动结合起来的作法，不仅解决了技术力量不足的困难，同时加快了运动的速度，提高了工具改革的质量。乐山县紧密结合当前生产，依靠农具厂职工的技术和群众的实践，在最近两个月内，就创制成功了两万件新式工具。
    四川省今年在工具改革中，贯彻了创、产、用、管、修、改一整套措施，以确保两条腿走路的方针的执行。这套措施是从去年全省大量制造、推广新式工具的经验中总结出来的。它从生产到使用的各个环节上，使工具改革运动沿着更细更扎实的健康方向前进，克服去年制造多、推广少、普及没有提高等缺点。目前，四川各地的工具生产部门和使用单位正在大力贯彻这套措施，各地农具厂已经或正在建立与健全产品验收制度，做到不合规格的返工，质量不好的不准出厂，出厂的工具包用、包换、包修理。
