Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, March 26th: Tens of thousands of workers at the Baotou Iron and Steel Base are taking various measures to fiercely attack the iron production barrier. In recent days, whether at key construction sites directly related to iron production such as iron ore mines, water sources, coking plants, and iron smelting plants, or in the general machinery repair factory rushing to manufacture equipment and process materials for iron production, workers have launched a fervent Red Flag emulation drive. The project is progressing rapidly.

At the iron smelting plant construction site of the "Ten Route Heroes' Great Battle," installation workers have caught up to the front. The main structure of the No. 1 blast furnace and three hot blast stoves is nearing completion. Now, on the 60-meter-high furnace top of the blast furnace and the tall gas scrubbing tower, the clatter of shovels cutting steel plates echoes, sparks from electric welding fly everywhere, the whistles of seven cranes rise and fall one after another, and the mechanical equipment installation is in full swing. Construction workers, in order to clear the way for the installation workers, are carrying out three shifts day and night on projects such as the blower station, material bin trestle, and large material pit. Pipeline workers are laying water pipes and gas pipes more than one meter thick in the air and underground, and furnace builders are inspecting and arranging various refractory bricks. At the coking plant, which is about to be put into production, the first coke oven has been baked to more than 500 degrees, and production workers are busy preparing for coking. At the Baiyunebo iron ore mine, electric locomotives have already been driven to the mountaintop working face; the medium crushing plant, which will supply the No. 1 blast furnace with rich ore ahead of schedule, is also being installed with equipment.

Baotou Steel this year must pass "three barriers: iron production, steel production, and steel product production." Since the beginning of the year, a mass movement with iron production as the first goal has been launched here. Recently, the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Baotou Steel Party Committee convened leading cadres from various plants and mines of Baotou Steel, and made more specific arrangements for the engineering projects and construction periods, deciding to appropriately shorten the battle lines, concentrate forces, and first break through the iron production barrier. The entire company further mobilized the masses around this task, so a new and active situation quickly appeared on the construction site.

In order to accelerate and support the construction of key projects, various plants and mines have further strengthened collaboration. The construction force of the iron smelting plant has now increased from more than 2,000 people to more than 6,000 people, and four civil engineering units and eight professional engineering companies and affiliated production enterprises have launched three-dimensional parallel cross-operations and coordinated operations. Key construction sites such as the iron smelting plant and coking plant have established front-line headquarters and Party working committees as dispatch agencies of the general company's Party and government leaders to uniformly lead, command, and schedule manpower and material resources. Some leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee and Baotou Steel have gone to the construction sites and workshops to strengthen leadership at the forefront. Functional departments such as design, engineering technology, material supply, and quality inspection have sent working groups led by leading cadres to work on the construction site. While strengthening organizational measures, a new upsurge in the mass movement has also risen. After the iron smelting plant construction site held a mobilization rally and skills competition on the 20th, the workers launched a Red Flag emulation movement to ensure construction period, ensure quality, ensure safety, and exceed quotas.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, March 26th: Under the guidance of the "national unified planning" principle, all parts of the country are vigorously supporting the construction of Baotou Steel. Since March, an average of more than 120 train cars of construction materials have been transported from all over the country to Baotou Steel every day, ensuring rapid progress of the project.

More than 200 major manufacturing factories in more than 40 cities across the country are rushing to manufacture equipment for Baotou Steel. In order to ensure that Baotou Steel produces iron ahead of schedule, the five major pieces of equipment for the No. 1 blast furnace (loading device, distributor, balance device, charging car winding machine, and mud gun) manufactured in Shenyang, the main equipment for coking ovens weighing more than 600 tons manufactured in Shanxi, the in-plant transfer equipment manufactured in Luda, and the electric locomotives for iron ore mines manufactured in Xiangtan have all been delivered ahead of schedule. Thousands of kinds of mechanical and electrical equipment and instruments manufactured by Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Xi'an, Kunming and other cities for Baotou Steel have also been partially transported ahead of schedule.

The building materials needed by Baotou Steel almost come from all over the country, from steel, cement, and refractory materials from the northeastern and northern provinces, to sleepers from Guangdong, bamboo from Guizhou, asphalt from Lanzhou, tools and asbestos from Sichuan, timber from the Greater Khingan Mountains in Inner Mongolia, and electrical and hardware materials from major cities across the country. Now trains loaded with materials arrive in Baotou from all over the country every day. The northeastern and northern provinces and regions and relevant departments across the country are strengthening support for Baotou Steel in terms of manpower, especially technical forces.

    数万建设大军展开红旗竞赛
    包钢力争早日出铁
    全国各地赶制设备、赶运材料、输送人员为包钢加油
    据新华社包头26日电　包头钢铁基地数万职工正在采取各种措施猛攻出铁关。这些天来，无论是在直接关系出铁的铁矿山、水源地、焦化厂、炼铁厂等重点工地上，或者是在为出铁赶制设备和加工材料的机修总厂里，职工们都开展了火热的红旗竞赛。工程在迅速进展。
    在“十路英雄大会战”的炼铁厂工地，安装工人赶到了前面。第一号高炉和三座热风炉的本体结构，快要安装完了。现在，在六十公尺高的高炉炉顶和高大的煤气洗涤塔上，铲钢板的铲枪哒哒响，电焊火花四处迸飞，七台起重机的笛声此起彼落，机械设备安装全面展开了。土建工人为了给安装工人开路，在鼓风机站、料仓栈桥、大料坑等工程上，昼夜三班突击。管道工人把一公尺多粗的水管和煤气管敷设在空中和地下，筑炉工人在检查排列各种耐火砖。在即将投入生产的焦化厂，第一座焦炉烘炉已烘到五百多度，生产工人正在忙着作出焦前的准备工作。在白云鄂博铁矿山，电机车已经开上了山顶工作面；将提前供应一号高炉富矿的中破碎厂，也正在安装设备。
    包钢今年要过“三关：出铁、出钢、出钢材。”年初以来，这里就掀起了以出铁为第一个目标的群众运动。最近，中共包头市委和包钢党委又召集包钢各厂矿领导干部，更具体地安排了工程项目和工期，决定适当缩短战线，集中力量，首先突破出铁第一关。全公司都围绕着这一任务进一步发动群众，因此工地上很快就出现了新的活跃局面。
    为了加快和支援重点工程的建设，各厂矿进一步加强了协作。炼铁厂的施工力量目前已由两千多人增加到六千多人，四个土建单位和八个专业工程公司、附属生产企业、展开了立体平行交叉作业，协同作战。炼铁厂、焦化厂等重点工地，都成立了前线指挥部和党的工作委员会作为总公司党政领导的派出机构，统一领导，统一指挥，统一调度人力物力。市委和包钢的部分领导干部，下到了工地、车间，加强第一线的领导。设计、工程技术、材料供应、质量检查等职能部门，都派出由领导干部率领的工作组，到工地办公。在加强组织措施的同时，群众运动新高潮也起来了。炼铁厂工地在20日举行誓师比武大会以后，职工们展开了保工期，保质量，保安全，超定额的红旗竞赛运动。
    新华社包头26日电　在“全国一盘棋”方针指导下，全国各地正大力支援包钢的建设。3月份以来，平均每天都有一百二十多个火车车皮的建设物资从各地运到包钢，保证工程迅速进展。
    全国有四十多个城市的二百多家主要制造工厂为包钢赶制设备。为了保证包钢提前出铁，沈阳制造的一号高炉设备五大件（装料装置、布料器、平衡装置、料车卷场机、泥炮），山西制造的六百多吨焦炉主要设备，旅大制造的厂内转运设备，湘潭制造的铁矿山电机车等，都提前交了货。上海、天津、北京、西安、昆明等城市，为包钢制造的成千种机电设备和仪表等，也有一部分提前运到。
  包钢需要的建筑材料，几乎来自全国，从东北华北各省的钢材、水泥、耐火材料，到广东的枕木，贵州的竹材，兰州的沥青，四川的工具和石绵，内蒙古大兴安岭的木材，以及全国各大城市的电气五金材料等。现在每天都有满载材料的火车，从全国各地到达包头。东北、华北各省区和全国有关部门，都在人力特别是技术力量方面加强了对包钢的支援。（附图片）
