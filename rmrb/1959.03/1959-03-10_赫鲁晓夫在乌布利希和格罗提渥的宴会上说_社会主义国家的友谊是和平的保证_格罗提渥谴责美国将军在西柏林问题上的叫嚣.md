Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Otto Grotewohl , Premier of the German Democratic Republic, held a grand banquet this evening at the Red Town Hall in Berlin for Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, who is visiting the German Democratic Republic.

    Grotewohl spoke at the banquet, and after describing the warm welcome given to Khrushchev by the working people of the German Democratic Republic, he said that the working people of the German Democratic Republic warmly welcome Khrushchev because he is a tireless and enthusiastic defender of the Soviet Union's policy of peace. The Soviet Union hopes to completely end the Hitler war and its consequences, to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and to achieve peace and relaxation of world tensions.

    The people's desire for peace and security has now become a tremendous force. The people are thoroughly disgusted with the Cold War; they never wanted it. Therefore, a cunning NATO politician in Bonn has spread a "brilliant" slogan around the world: the Cold War must be replaced by flexible diplomatic warfare. But war is war after all. Flexible diplomatic warfare, like the Cold War, should end.

    Grotewohl said that U.S. President Eisenhower stated last week that he opposes a unilateral treaty with the two Germanys. If he really thinks that way, then he should first abolish the military treaty that the Western countries unilaterally concluded with the Federal Republic in Paris. Mr. Eisenhower said that he is willing to negotiate the issue of a peace treaty with the whole of Germany. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a peace conference to discuss and adopt a unified peace treaty with the two Germanys provides all the possibilities in this regard. Grotewohl said that the impression one gets is that some active and retired generals in the United States are now suffering from nervous breakdowns. They are threatening to use force to open up the supposedly free lines of communication to West Berlin, which are already free. Since it has been suggested that the major powers concerned guarantee free traffic from all directions to the demilitarized free city, what does it mean to irresponsibly yell about a blockade that no one is prepared to implement?

    If some gentlemen in the West think that by shouting like this they can maintain in the heart of Europe those privileges that they have already had to relinquish in the former colonial countries, they are greatly mistaken.

    Grotewohl then pointed out that the Leipzig Spring Fair once again confirms that the German Democratic Republic is an independent and sovereign state, and that its highly developed industry and achievements in the economic, social, and cultural fields are recognized worldwide. It is fully committed to serving the well-being of its people and peace.

    Grotewohl said that the residents of West Berlin, like the residents of our republic and the people of all countries who are willing to maintain and guarantee peace, are concerned about eliminating the sources of tension caused by the West Berlin occupation regime. The great achievement of the Soviet government is that it proposed the establishment of a demilitarized free city and put forward practical solutions, regarding which the government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to negotiate with all relevant countries.

    Grotewohl particularly pointed out that this grand reception is being held on International Women's Day, "March 8th". By virtue of their vocation, women and mothers are enemies of war and protectors of life, and therefore also protectors of peace. Grotewohl thanked all the women of the republic and congratulated women all over the world. He said that in our republic, women have made outstanding contributions to the cause of peace and socialist construction. We assure women all over the world that our meeting and consultation with Comrade Khrushchev will help realize the heartfelt desires of all women – to ensure peace, security, and happiness for their children.

    Khrushchev then spoke, expressing his heartfelt gratitude to the German Democratic Republic for its hospitality and deep affection. He said that this is a manifestation of the German people's most sincere and best feelings towards the Soviet people.

    Khrushchev pointed out that the friendship between the Soviet people and the working people of the German Democratic Republic is constantly growing and consolidating, just as the friendship between the people of all socialist countries is constantly growing and consolidating. This friendship is the guarantee of our achievements and the guarantee of all our victories. As long as this friendship continues to grow and consolidate, we will not fear any enemy.

    He said that the friendship of the people of socialist countries is a solid guarantee for consolidating peace in the world. Socialist countries are the most peace-loving countries because the development of our countries requires peace, peace, and only peace.

    We will do everything we can to strive to eliminate the "Cold War," ease international tensions, and establish greater mutual understanding among the people of all countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.

    Khrushchev finally congratulated all the women of the world on "March 8th," wishing them greater victories in the struggle to defend world peace.

    The banquet took place in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The guests and hosts frequently toasted to peace, to the people of the two countries, and to the health of the President of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck, and the party and government leaders of the two countries.

    Attending the banquet were party and state leaders of the German Democratic Republic, representatives of workers from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, diplomatic envoys from various countries to the German Democratic Republic, and government delegations from various countries participating in the Leipzig Fair.

    赫鲁晓夫在乌布利希和格罗提渥的宴会上说
    社会主义国家的友谊是和平的保证
    格罗提渥谴责美国将军在西柏林问题上的叫嚣
    新华社柏林8日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今晚在柏林红色市政厅为苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问德意志民主共和国举行盛大宴会。
    格罗提渥在宴会上讲了话，他在叙述了德意志民主共和国劳动人民对赫鲁晓夫欢迎的热烈情况后说，德意志民主共和国劳动人民热烈地欢迎赫鲁晓夫，因为他是苏联和平政策的不倦的、热情的捍卫者。苏联希望彻底终结希特勒战争及其后果，希望缔结对德和约，希望和平和缓和世界紧张局势。
    人民要求和平和安全的愿望在目前成了一支巨大的力量。人民对冷战厌恶透了，他们从来不希望冷战。因此，波恩的一个狡猾的北大西洋公约组织的政客在世界上散布了一个“英明”的口号：必须用灵活的外交战争来代替冷战。但是，战争毕竟是战争。灵活的外交战争，也同冷战一样，应当结束。
    格罗提渥说，美国总统艾森豪威尔先生在上星期说过，他反对单方面同两个德国缔结条约。如果他真的这样想，那末他应当首先废除西方国家单方面同联邦共和国在巴黎缔结的军事条约。艾森豪威尔先生说，他愿意就同整个德国缔结和约的问题进行谈判。而苏联提出召开和会来讨论和通过同两个德国缔结的统一和约的建议，正就提供了这方面的一切可能性。格罗提渥说，目前人们得到的印象是：美国的一些现役和退役的将军们现在神经失常。他们威胁要用武力来打通本来就是自由的通到西柏林的自由交通线。既然已经建议由各有关大国保证从各个方向到非军事化的自由城市的自由交通，那么，这样不负责任地大叫谁也不准备实行的封锁，意味着什么呢？
    如果西方的某些先生们以为，他们这样叫嚷就可以在欧洲中心保住他们在过去的殖民地国家中也已经不得不放弃了的那些特权，那么他们就大错而特错了。
    格罗提渥接着指出，来比锡春季博览会又一次证实，德意志民主共和国是一个独立的有主权的国家，举世公认它高度发达的工业，经济、社会和文化各方面的成就。它全力在为本国人民的幸福与和平服务。
    格罗提渥说，西柏林的居民，也同我们共和国居民以及愿意维护和保证和平的各国人民一样，关心消除西柏林占领制造成的紧张根源。苏联政府的巨大功绩在于，它建议建立非军事化的自由城市，并提出了切实可行的解决办法，关于这种解决办法，德意志民主共和国政府愿意同一切有关国家进行谈判。
    格罗提渥特别指出，这次盛大的招待会是在“三八”国际妇女节这一天举行的。由于自己的天职，妇女和母亲是战争的敌人、生活的保卫者，从而也是和平的保卫者。格罗提渥感谢共和国全体妇女，并向全世界妇女祝贺。他说，在我们共和国中，妇女对和平和社会主义建设事业作出了卓越的贡献。我们向全世界妇女保证，我们同赫鲁晓夫同志的会晤和会商将有助于实现所有妇女内心的愿望——保障她们的儿女得到和平、安全和幸福。
    赫鲁晓夫接着讲话，他衷心地感谢德意志民主共和国对他的殷勤招待和深情厚意。他说，这是德国人民对苏联人民的最真诚、最良好的感情的表现。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联人民和德意志民主共和国劳动人民之间的友谊在不断增长和巩固，正如所有社会主义国家人民之间的友谊不断增长和巩固那样。这种友谊是我们成就的保证，是我们一切胜利的保证。只要这种友谊不断增长和巩固，任何敌人我们都不怕。
    他说，社会主义国家人民的友谊是世界巩固和平的牢靠保证。社会主义国家是最爱好和平的国家，因为，我们这些国家的发展需要和平、和平，而且只需要和平。
    我们将尽一切力量来争取消除“冷战”，缓和国际紧张局势、树立各国人民之间以和平共处原则为基础的更多的互相谅解。
    赫鲁晓夫最后向全世界的妇女祝贺“三八”节，祝她们在保卫世界和平的斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    宴会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。宾主之间频频为和平、为两国人民、为德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克和两国党政领导人的健康而干杯。
    参加这次宴会的有德意志民主共和国党和国家领导人、德意志民主共和国和西德的工人代表、各国驻德意志民主共和国外交使节和参加来比锡博览会的各国政府代表团。
