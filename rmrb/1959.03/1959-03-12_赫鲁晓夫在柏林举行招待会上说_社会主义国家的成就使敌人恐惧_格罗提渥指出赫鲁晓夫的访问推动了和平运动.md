Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th -- Soviet Premier Khrushchev held a grand reception at the Soviet Embassy in Berlin tonight.

Present at the reception were leaders of the German Democratic Republic, including Grotewohl, Ulbricht, Dieckmann, representatives of the National Front of Democratic Germany, heads of various democratic parties and mass organizations, senior officers of the National People's Army, representatives of advanced workers in industrial and agricultural production, and prominent figures from scientific and cultural circles.

On the Soviet side, attendees included Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin, Soviet Ambassador to Germany Pervukhin, staff of the Soviet Embassy in Germany, and senior officers of the Soviet forces stationed in Germany. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Reimann, the Finnish parliamentary delegation, and diplomats from various countries also attended the reception.

Khrushchev spoke at the reception. He said that our visit to the German Democratic Republic is coming to an end. The talks we have held and the meetings with the German people convincingly demonstrate that the friendly and fraternal relations between our two peoples are being consolidated and developed year by year.

He said that the meeting with the workers at the Ninth All-German Workers' Conference in Leipzig left a very deep impression on me. At this conference, 1,100 representatives of the West German working class, staff members of the Social Democratic Party, and trade union workers participated. This was a moving meeting with our class brothers. We were surprised and very pleased that the representatives of the West German working class understood our policies so deeply and correctly and gave them such high praise. This shows that there are currently very favorable conditions for uniting the efforts of all German people in the struggle to defend peace and strive for the vital interests of the German working people. Khrushchev said that he had held many meetings with all kinds of Germans here.

Referring to the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, Khrushchev pointed out that good relations have been established and are developing smoothly between the peoples of our two countries, between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the leaders of the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev pointed out that more and more people in the world are beginning to realize that in countries that have embarked on the path of socialist development, the economy is developing by leaps and bounds, the living standards of the working people are constantly improving, the working day is being shortened, and true people's democracy is being fully developed. In these countries, there are no economic crises like those encountered by capitalist countries, and there is no terrible disaster for the working people—unemployment.

Our enemies—the enemies of communism—often feel great unease. The achievements of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries frighten them. Many of them now do not deny that socialist countries will overtake capitalist countries in their development. There are also some skeptical people who say that our plans are grand, but these plans may not be completed on schedule. However, before long, these gentlemen will understand the reality of our plans.

Grotewohl then spoke. He said that the Leipzig Fair, due to Khrushchev's visit, has become a global gathering place for peaceful coexistence. The proposals made by Khrushchev in Leipzig and Berlin have been warmly approved, which proves that Khrushchev's visit has given a new and powerful impetus to the surging peace movement and the socialist forces all over the world.

Grotewohl then talked about the German issue. He said that eliminating the source of tension in West Germany and West Berlin has become an urgent need. The government of the German Democratic Republic has constantly expressed its desire to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys and has announced its willingness to take and support any measures to normalize the situation in West Berlin. He said, today I once again express this desire on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Referring to the achievements of the Leipzig International Fair, Grotewohl pointed out that the economic strength of the German Democratic Republic is constantly growing and its international prestige is constantly increasing. This year, the trade volume of this fair has increased by 35% compared with last year. We regard this as recognition of the labor achievements of the residents, workers, farmers, scientists, and technical experts of the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl finally said that the unbreakable friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, and with the people of other socialist countries, is a reliable guarantee for the German people to move towards peace, prosperity, and happiness.

    赫鲁晓夫在柏林举行招待会上说
    社会主义国家的成就使敌人恐惧
    格罗提渥指出赫鲁晓夫的访问推动了和平运动
    新华社柏林10日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今晚在柏林苏联大使馆举行了盛大的招待宴会。
    出席这个宴会的有德意志民主共和国领导人格罗提渥、乌布利希、狄克曼等，以及民主德国全国阵线代表、各民主党派、群众团体负责人、国家人民军高级军官、工农业生产战线上的积极分子代表和科学文化界著名人士。
    苏联方面出席宴会的有苏联外交部副部长佐林、苏联驻德大使别尔乌辛、苏联驻德使馆人员和苏联驻军的高级军官。德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼，芬兰议会代表团和各国使节也参加了宴会。
    赫鲁晓夫在宴会上讲了话。他说，我们在德意志民主共和国的访问即将结束。我们所进行的会谈和同德国人民的会见，都令人信服地说明，我们两国人民之间的友好的兄弟关系正在一年年地巩固和发展。
    他说，在来比锡第九次全德工人代表会议上同工人的会见给我留下了非常深刻的印象，在这次会议上有一千一百名西德工人阶级的代表、社会民主党的工作人员和工会工作者参加。这是同我们的阶级弟兄的一次动人的会见。西德工人阶级的代表对我们的政策理解得非常深刻和正确，并给它很高的评价，这使我们感到惊奇和非常高兴。这一点说明，目前有最有利的条件把全体德国人民在为保卫和平、争取德国劳动人民的切身利益的斗争中的努力联合起来。赫鲁晓夫说，我在这里曾同各式各样的德国人进行了许多次会见。
    在谈到苏德两国的友好关系时，赫鲁晓夫指出，我们两国人民之间、苏联共产党同德国统一社会党之间、苏联领导人同德意志民主共和国领导人之间建立了很好的关系，这种关系在不断顺利发展。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在世界上越来越多的人开始认识到，在走上社会主义发展道路的国家里，经济在飞跃发展，劳动人民的生活水平在不断提高，工作日在缩短，真正的人民的民主得到充分的发扬。在这些国家里没有资本主义国家所遭到的经济危机，没有劳动人民遭到可怕的灾难——失业。
    我们的敌人——共产主义的敌人经常感到极大的不安。苏联和所有社会主义国家的成就使他们感到恐惧。其中许多人现在并不否认，社会主义国家在自己的发展方面会赶过资本主义国家。还有一些抱着怀疑态度的人说，我们的计划是宏伟的，不过这种计划不见得会按期完成。但是，用不了多久，这些先生们就会明白我们计划的现实性。
    格罗提渥接着讲话。他说，来比锡博览会由于赫鲁晓夫的访问，成了和平共处的世界集议场所。赫鲁晓夫在来比锡和柏林的建议受到人们热烈的赞同，这证明了赫鲁晓夫这次访问给了汹涌澎湃的和平运动和全世界社会主义的力量以新的有力的推动。
    格罗提渥接着谈到德国问题。他说，消除西德和西柏林产生紧张局势的策源地已经成为迫切的需要。德意志民主共和国政府不断表示要求缔结一个同两个德国的和约的愿望，并且宣布愿意采取和支持使西柏林局势正常化的任何措施。他说，今天我代表德意志民主共和国政府再次表示这种愿望。
    在谈到来比锡国际博览会的成就时，格罗提渥指出，德意志民主共和国的经济实力在不断增长，国际威望在不断提高。今年这个博览会的贸易额比去年增加了35％。我们把这看作是对德意志民主共和国居民，工人、农民、科学家、技术专家的劳动成果的承认。
    格罗提渥最后说，德意志民主共和国同苏联，同其他社会主义国家人民的牢不可破的友谊，是德国人民走向和平、繁荣和幸福的可靠保证。
