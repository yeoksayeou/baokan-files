He said, "In the arduous struggle for national liberation, the Vietnamese and Indian people have come to understand each other deeply. Today, both of our countries are independent, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference are closely linking us together. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the Republic of India's contribution to safeguarding world peace, and especially welcome India's shouldering of the important responsibility of the International Supervisory and Control Commission to maintain peace in Indochina."

Now, that era of foreign rule is over. Both countries have gained freedom.

He said that currently, our major task is to raise the living standards of our people, and I believe that in this regard, we can progress and may be able to maintain this progress. We hope that our two countries can help each other with our own contributions.
