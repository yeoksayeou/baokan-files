Message of Respect to the Women's International Democratic Federation

To the Respected Madame Eugénie Cotton and the Women's International Democratic Federation:

    As women from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, commemorate International Women's Day on March 8th, we extend to you our highest respects!

    1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward for the entire nation in our country, and our socialist construction achieved unprecedented victories. These victories are the result of the hard work, upward striving, and multi-faceted and rapid construction by Chinese women together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. These victories play a huge role in maintaining and consolidating world peace. Now, Beijing women are working with the people of the city and the whole country to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national construction plan, to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in our country, to strive to build our nation into a great socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at an early date, and to defend the great cause of world peace.

    Beijing women wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the Women's International Democratic Federation's appeal to women around the world, and are determined to unite more closely with all peace-loving women and people around the world, to fight to the end for the glorious cause of peace, for the elimination of war, and for the struggle for and protection of the rights of women and children!

       The Commemoration Meeting of International Women's Day on March 8th by Women from All Walks of Life in the Capital of the People's Republic of China.
                                            March 7, 1959
