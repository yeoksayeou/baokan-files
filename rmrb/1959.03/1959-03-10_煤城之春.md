Spring in the Coal City
By our reporter Ye Jianyun

Coming to Hegang, one is struck by a sense of novelty everywhere.

Located at 48 degrees north latitude, one might imagine it to be exceptionally cold, but strangely enough, the climate in this basin of the Lesser Khingan Mountains is quite mild. The snow has begun to melt, and the roads are wet; the poplars along the roadside are budding. It is said that just a few days ago, the air was so cold that one's breath would turn to ice, but in just five or six days, the season has changed so quickly. Truly: "Suddenly, like a spring breeze overnight, thousands of trees bloom with pear blossoms." The people of Hegang are welcoming a vibrant spring.

Most of the offices in the municipal committee are sparsely occupied, with typewriters clattering away. Upon inquiry, it was learned that they had gone down to the mines.

We made a brief stop in the city, preparing to go to Xing'an Platform.

The Xing'an Platform Coal Mine is the farthest unit from the city, requiring a car ride of more than thirty minutes. The car moved forward on a flat highway. Outside the window, there are vast fields, very few houses, and dense oak forests on the hills. My travel companion told me that this is the "Great Northern Wilderness" where one can "knock out roe deer with a stick and scoop up fish with a ladle." We were enthusiastically discussing the stories of the Great Northern Wilderness when the car quickly reached its destination. Currently, the particularly robust vertical shaft and the especially tall coal preparation plant and coal washing plant buildings create a charming scene compared to the fertile Great Northern Wilderness.

The Xing'an Platform vertical shaft was built with Soviet assistance to China. From mining to underground transportation, almost everything is mechanized and automated. It is a modern, large-scale mine. However, the leaders here have maintained a so-called "guerrilla habit" style of work.

Mao Jinlai, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, has his desk placed by the window. On an ordinary nine-drawer desk, one end has a telephone and stationery, while the other end has a bedding roll. It is just after eight o'clock in the morning, and it seems that the owner of this bedding, due to getting up in a hurry, has not had time to fold it carefully. Walking into the offices of the three nearby secretaries, I discovered that each person had a bedroll. Not only does the secretary's office have a set of bedding, but also the mine manager, chief engineer, and cadres of each pit section have bedrolls in their offices.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the production upsurge in Xing'an Platform has consistently increased. The designed capacity of this vertical shaft is 1.5 million tons of coal per year. According to the design requirements, it should reach the designed level by the end of this year. However, last year, they produced 1.45 million tons. 1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward and a year of promotion. At the end of the year, when people were considering how much coal should be produced in 1959, the number 1.45 million became a motivator. The miners said that anything less would be embarrassing, at least double it. Therefore, Xing'an Platform's plan for this year jumped from 1.45 million to 2.9 million. When this figure was proposed, the miners still felt it was not ideal. Since it was a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, why not put all their energy into it! The Party committee concentrated everyone's opinions and proposed a second target of 3.5 million.

The Party committee is holding a series of meetings specifically to study how to create a situation where the high tide rises higher every day. Although Xing'an Platform has always been in a magnificent high tide, the leaders here clearly see that doubling coal production is not a simple matter. Coal is buried underground, and to dig it out requires reliable geological data, tunneling, extraction, underground transportation, hoisting, and above-ground transportation. This is a series of links, and if any link is broken, it will affect the overall situation. To double production, the enthusiasm of the masses must be combined with concrete measures. Therefore, their slogan is: Boldly set plans, carefully make arrangements.

Here, we read through a thick file, which contains the specific measures Xing'an Platform Coal Mine will take to ensure the completion of 2.9 million tons and strive to complete 3.5 million tons. This document was obviously written recently, and the problems summarized and analyzed are mostly the weak links exposed during the Great Leap Forward last year. Following closely behind these weak links are several large and small measures. Among the measures, they particularly emphasized not calculating the lack of equipment, because such calculations would not yield results. Doubling the designed capacity of 1.5 million tons is, of course, proposed on the premise of not increasing equipment. Efforts should be focused on the people who use the equipment. Not long ago, the transportation department reported that the underground lines' throughput capacity was very tight. After cadres, workers, and technicians brainstormed together, they only changed one switch, and the throughput capacity immediately increased threefold.

Fully mobilizing people to unleash the potential of equipment is a guiding ideology and a thought-provoking issue.

Leaving the Party committee office, we went down to the mine, more than 200 meters below the surface. The first person we met in the mine was signalman Chi Lianzhang, who introduced himself as a motivator. This is indeed the case: as soon as he pulls the signal, with a rumble, in less than three minutes, forty tons of coal are hoisted to the surface. There are 525,600 minutes in a year, and he can pull the signal 175,200 times. By this calculation, he can send 5 million tons of coal to the surface in a year, excluding the necessary mechanical maintenance time. If 3.5 million tons are produced this year, the task is still insufficient. Chi Lianzhang is a burly man. I asked him, "Is the work energetic?" He pointed to the wide-open coal container and laughed, saying, "Well, we are well-fed and warmly clothed, but it, this guy, is always starving." I looked at this fully automated behemoth again and again. Old Chi tapped the baffle with a hammer and shouted, "This year, let's do 3.5 million, and maybe it will be 5 million next year. One day, we will feed it full." Yes, time is a constant for everyone. There are 525,600 minutes in a year for each person. In these days of racing against time, who would be willing to fall behind!

At twelve o'clock, we sat in the underground transportation dispatch room waiting for the electric locomotive to go to the Red Flag Coal Mining Team in the twelfth mining area. After waiting for a while, the driver Zhang Zongming took us there. Zhang Zongming is a twenty-three-year-old young man with a simple farmer's face, occasionally revealing an innocent smile. He told me that a year ago, he was still a farmer, and he had only been learning to drive for more than half a year. The day before yesterday, he could only pull fifteen cars, today he pulled eighteen cars, and tomorrow's plan is to pull twenty cars. He is confident that he will pull twenty-five cars the day after tomorrow. He is a skating enthusiast, but in order to achieve this plan, he did not enter the skating rink once this winter, and all his time was spent studying the structure of the electric locomotive and understanding the essentials of driving.

"The Red Flag Coal Mining Team has arrived." The guide told us. Here, you can't see a single person, and all you can hear is the sound of a gale blowing and heavy rain falling. After walking a few steps, there is a coal transport trough, many coal troughs, like mountain streams, flowing to the coal loading station. Shining the miner's lamp, the shiny black coal is really lovely.

Since we have arrived at the Red Flag Coal Mining Team, why can't we see anyone? While wondering, we suddenly heard someone speaking from above. At this time, we realized that we were standing at the foot of the coal mining team's mountain. After climbing a steep slope of more than one hundred meters, we saw the Red Flag Coal Mining Team's personnel.

The Red Flag Coal Mining Team has a total of seventy-five people, each full of vigor and vitality. In their team, such a sensational event occurred in the entire mining area. In the morning, one shift took five hours to complete a cycle, and the work efficiency exceeded the average level by four times. When the second shift went to work, they did not show any weakness. They said: No pit until the first shift is exceeded. As a result, it only took four hours to complete a cycle. Wu Liancai, the second shift leader, is a very honest person. He immediately called the third shift and told Sun Hongyu, the third shift leader, about his experience in taking two cycles in one shift. The third shift leader is a steady person. As soon as he received the call, he went to work early to study the situation of the working face. When the second shift leader discovered that four people in the third shift were on public leave and there were fewer people in the shift, he took the lead in leaving four people to help the third shift complete two cycles. The comrades of the third shift did not agree. On the surface, they said they were afraid that they would be too tired to work two shifts in a row, but in their hearts, they wanted to do something amazing with fewer people. As a result, they absorbed the experience of the first and second shifts and worked cleverly. Even with four fewer people in one shift, they completed two cycles. For this reason, the people of the Red Flag Coal Mining Team also wrote a poem:

As long as the enthusiasm is great, even high mountains listen;
We come and it gives way, coal follows us to dig.

In the four hours underground, I heard and saw the heroic deeds of the workers chasing each other and racing against time. Back in the city, it was already dusk, the time of ten thousand lights.

Spring has come. Hegang, this coal city, is using advanced indicators, solid measures, and soaring enthusiasm to welcome the most beautiful spring in the world.

    煤城之春
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    来到鹤岗，到处给人一种新鲜的感觉。
    这儿地处北纬四十八度，在一般人的想像当中，大概是异常寒冷了，可是，说来奇怪，在这块小兴安岭的盆地上，气候却显得相当温和。积雪开始融化了，公路上湿漉漉的；路旁的白杨，含苞欲放。据说，几天前，这儿还嘘气成冰，不过五六天，季节就变得这样快。真是：忽如一夜春风来，千树万树梨花开。鹤岗的人们，正在迎接着生机勃发的春天。
    市委会的多数办公室很少留人，打字机在滴?作响。一问，才知道他们是下矿去了。
    我们在市内稍作停留，准备到兴安台去。
    兴安台煤矿，是离市区最远的一个单位，小汽车要跑三十多分钟。车子在平坦的公路上前进。窗外，沃野千里，极少人家，山岗子上柞树林子密密层层。旅伴告诉我，这儿就是棒打獐子瓢舀鱼的北大荒。我们正在津津有味地谈说着北大荒的故事，车子很快就到目的地了。目下，特别魁梧的竖井和特别高大的选煤厂，洗煤厂的厂房同那肥沃的北大荒比起来，又是一番迷人景象。
    兴安台竖井是苏联帮助我国建设的，从采掘到井上下运输，几乎全部是机械化自动化的，这是一座现代化的大型矿井。然而，这里的领导人员却保持了所谓“游击习气”的作风。
    党委副书记毛金来的办公桌子是临窗摆着的，一张普通的九屉桌子上，一头是电话机子和文件纸墨，另一头却放着一个铺盖卷儿。现在是早晨八点多钟，看来这副行李的主人，由于起身仓促，还没有来得及仔细卷叠，走到临近的三位书记办公室里，发觉每人都有一床铺盖。这里不仅书记办公室有一套铺盖，而且矿长、总工程师、各坑段的干部，办公室都有铺盖卷。
    大跃进以来，兴安台的生产高潮一直是有涨无落。这里的竖井，设计能力是年产一百五十万吨煤炭，根据设计要求，要到今年年底才能达到设计水平，结果，去年他们就生产了一百四十五万吨。1958年是个跃进年，又是促进年。年末，当人们在考虑1959年应该生产多少煤炭的时候，一百四十五万这个数字却当了促进派。矿工们说，少了拿不出手，起码是翻一番。于是，兴安台今年的计划，就从一百四十五万跳到了二百九十万。这个数字一提出，矿工们还觉得它不够理想，既然是更大更好更全面的跃进，为什么不把浑身的力气都拿出来呢！党委集中了大家的意见，又提出了第二本账三百五十万。
    党委正在进行一系列的会议，专门研究如何形成高潮日日高的形势问题。尽管兴安台一直是处在波澜壮阔的高潮当中，这里的领导人却清楚地看到：要煤炭成倍地增长，这是一件不简单的事情。煤埋藏在地下，把它挖出来，要有可靠的地质资料，要掘巷道、回采、井下运输、提升、井上运输，这是一系列的环节，在哪个环上脱了节，都会影响全局。要产量翻一番，必须把群众的干劲和具体措施结合起来，因此，他们提出的口号是：大胆订计划，细心作安排。
    在这里，我们翻阅了一本厚厚的文件，这是兴安台煤矿保证完成二百九十万吨争取完成三百五十万吨的具体措施。这个文件显然是最近写成，其中总结分析的问题，多是去年大跃进当中暴露出来的一些薄弱环节，紧跟在这些薄弱环节的后面，就是若干条大大小小的措施。在措施当中，他们特别强调了不要去算设备少不够用这本账，因为这样的算账方法是算不出油水来的。一百五十万吨的设计能力，要翻一番，当然是在不增加设备的前提下提出来的，应当在使用设备的人，在他们身上打主意。不久以前，运输部门反映井下线路通过能力很紧张，经过干部、工人、技术人员一道想办法，结果，只改了一个道岔子，通过能力一下就提高了三倍。
    充分动员人，去发挥设备的潜力，这是一种指导思想，也是一个耐人寻味的问题。
    离开党委办公室，来到离地面两百多公尺的井下。在井下会见的第一个人是信号工迟连章，他在自我介绍时，竟以促进派自居。事实的确这样：他只要一拉信号，轰隆一声，不到三分钟，四十吨煤就提升到井上去了。一年是五十二万五千六百分钟，他可以拉十七万五千二百次信号，以此推算，一年之内，除去必要的机械维修时间，他可以把五百万吨煤送到井上去。如果今年出三百五十万吨，任务也是不足的。迟连章是个身材魁梧的人，我问他：“工作干的起劲吗？”他却指着张开了大嘴的煤罐子笑笑，说：“咱嘛，饱食暖衣，可就是它，这家伙常闹饥荒。”我把这个完全自动化的庞然大物看了又看。老迟用鎯头敲了一下挡板，大声地嚷道：“今年来个三百五，明年说不定就是五百万，总有一天，咱们是会把它喂饱的。”是的，时间对每个人来说都是常数，一年，每人都是五十二万五千六百分钟，在这分秒必争的日子里，有谁会甘心落后呢！
    十二点，我们坐在井下运输调度室里等着去十二采区红旗采煤队的电机车。等了一会儿，驾驶员张宗明送我们前去。张宗明是个二十三岁的青年人，一副纯朴的农民面孔，时而露出天真的憨笑。他告诉我，一年前，他还是一个农民，学开车子不过半年多。前天，他只能拉十五节，今天他拉到了十八节，明天的计划是拉二十节，后天，他满有把握地说，一定要拉上二十五节。他是个溜冰迷，可是，为了实现这个计划，这个冬天，他一次也没有进溜冰场，时间全花在研究电机车的构造和领会司机的要领上面了。
      “红旗采煤队到了”。响导告诉我们说。在这里，看不到一个人，耳朵里只听得像在刮狂风下暴雨。脚下走不几步，就有一个运煤槽，许许多多的煤槽，像山间的小溪，向装煤站流去。矿灯一照，乌光溜溜的煤炭，真惹人喜爱。
    既然到了红旗采煤队，为什么瞧不见一个人呢。正在疑惑，忽听得高处有人讲话，这时，才发觉我们是站在采煤队的山脚下。又爬了一百多公尺的陡坡，才见到了红旗采煤队的人马。
    红旗采煤队一共七十五个人，个个生龙活虎。在他们队里曾发生过这样一件轰动全矿区的事情。早晨，一班花五个小时，拿下了一个循环，工效超过了平均水平的四倍。二班一上班，毫不示弱，他们说：不超过一班不升坑。结果只花了四个小时就拿下了一个循环。二班长吴连才，人挺厚道，连忙打电话给三班，把他们一班拿两个循环的体会告诉了三班长孙洪裕。三班长人稳重，一接到电话，就提前上班研究掌子面的形势。当二班长发觉三班有四个人公休，班上少人的时候，自己带头留下四个人帮助三班拿下两个循环。三班的同志怎么也不答应，面子上是说，怕他们连干两个班累得吃不消，骨子里头是想来个人少出大活的惊人之举。结果，他们吸取了一、二两个班的经验，来了个巧干，一个班少四个人，也干成了两个循环。为此，红旗采煤队的人还写了一首诗：
    只要干劲大，高山也听话；
    咱来它让路，煤炭随咱挖。
    在井下四个小时，听到、看到了工人们你追我赶、争分争秒的英雄事迹。回到市区，已经是夜色苍茫，万户灯火的时候了。
    春天来了，鹤岗这座煤城，正在用先进的指标，扎实的措施，冲天的干劲，迎接着人间最美好的春天。
