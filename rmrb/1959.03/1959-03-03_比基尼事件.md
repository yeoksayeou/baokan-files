    Bikini Incident
    On March 1, 1954, the United States, disregarding the protests of peace-loving people all over the world, conducted a hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island (at the northern end of the Marshall Islands), and once again publicly and illegally declared the nearby high seas a "restricted zone." At that time, the Japanese fishing boat "Fifth Fukuryu Maru," which was fishing on the high seas eighty miles away from the "restricted zone," was harmed by radioactive dust from the American hydrogen bomb explosion.
    Two days later, the crew of the "Fifth Fukuryu Maru" all fell ill. Kuboyama Aikichi, the radio operator on the fishing boat, was the most seriously ill. When he was sent to the hospital, his whole body was yellow and his liver was severely damaged. Kuboyama groaned on his sickbed for 207 days and finally died tragically. He became the first victim in the world to die under an American hydrogen bomb. The Japanese people believe that this is the third tragedy brought to the Japanese people after the United States used atomic bombs to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
    Kuboyama Aikichi's tragic fate aroused boundless indignation and protests from the people of Japan and all countries of the world. For five years, the Japanese people have continuously launched large-scale movements to protest against American nuclear weapons testing. Since the Bikini Island incident alone, the number of people who have signed petitions demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons has increased to 35 million; the people of the world have actively supported the just struggle of the Japanese people.
    However, the United States has not stopped nuclear tests because of the protests of Japan and the people of various countries. Instead, it has repeatedly expanded the "restricted zone" on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean and around the territory entrusted to it by the United Nations, and continues to conduct nuclear explosion tests, endangering the freedom and safety of navigation on the high seas. What is especially shameful is that the United States, under the pretext of treating the affected Japanese patients, attempted to bring them to the United States as "experimental subjects" for "researching" hydrogen bombs. The Japanese people resolutely condemned this shameless attempt by the United States. (East)

    比基尼事件
    1954年3月1日，美国不顾全世界爱好和平人民的抗议，在比基尼岛（马绍尔群岛北端）进行氢弹试验，并又一次公然非法宣布附近的公海为“禁区”。当时在距“禁区”八十哩公海上捕鱼的日本渔船“福龙丸第五号”，受到美国氢弹爆炸的放射性微尘的伤害。
    两天后，“福龙丸第五号”的船员都病倒了。渔船上的无线电报务员久保山爱吉病得最重，被送入医院的时候，周身发黄，肝脏损伤严重。久保山呻吟于病榻达二百零七天，终于悲惨地死去。他成了世界上第一个死在美国氢弹下的牺牲者，日本人民认为，这是继美国于1945年用原子弹轰炸广岛和长崎之后给日本人民带来的第三个悲剧。
    久保山爱吉的悲惨命运激起了全日本和世界各国人民的无比愤恨和抗议。五年来日本人民连续大规模地展开了抗议美国试验核武器运动，仅从比基尼岛事件发生以来，签名要求禁止核武器的人数已增加到三千五百万人；全世界人民都积极地支援了日本人民的这一正义斗争。
    但是美国并没有因为日本和各国人民的抗议而停止核试验，反而在太平洋公海上和联合国委任它托管的领土周围一再扩大“禁区”，继续不断地进行核爆炸试验，危害公海航行自由和安全；尤其可耻的是，美国借口治疗受害的日本患者，企图把他们弄到美国作为“研究”氢弹的“实验品”，日本人民坚决地谴责了美国这种无耻图谋。（东）
