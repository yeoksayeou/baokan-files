    Praising the Mountain Area
    Jin Jin
    Good mountain area, rich mountain area, good mountain area, the mountain area is full of treasures everywhere, chestnuts and walnuts hang on the trees, bamboo shoots and medicinal materials are dug from the ground; gold, silver, copper, iron and coal are buried underground waiting for you to find them. Who comes to find the treasure, it is the exploration team, find it this year and open it this year, so many factories are set up.
    Wheat Ears Grow Doubled
    Black stones, piece by piece, just mined from the mountains, the stones are soft and loose, like mud and coal, the coal-bearing shale is sent to the fertilizer plant to make the best fertilizer, apply it to the wheat field, the wheat ears grow doubled.
    Cowherd (and Two Other Poems)
  　Liu Raomin
    The cowherd's singing is the most beautiful, the cowherd's whip is the crispest. Sing of the red sun in the morning, drive the sheep out of the village. Sing of a hundred kinds of flowers at noon, drive the sheep all over the mountain. Sing of the stars in the sky at night, drive the sheep back into the pen. The song ends and the whip cracks, the sheep travel tens of thousands of miles like clouds. The song begins and the whip falls, the sheep roll like the Yellow River.
    Little Horticulturalist
    One tree blooms with a hundred kinds of flowers, red, orange, yellow and green like a rainbow. Who has such great skill? We little horticulturalists. One small tree bears a hundred kinds of fruits, bitter, sweet, sour, and astringent, all without difference. Who has such great ability? We little horticulturalists.
    Little Manure Basket
    Little manure basket, little manure fork, take it with you every time you go out. Dog manure is smelly, horse manure is dirty, put it in the basket when you see it. You pick up gold, he picks up silver, it’s better to go with me to pick up manure. Manure is treasure, the crops are good, the Kunlun Mountains are smaller than the grain piles!

    夸山区
    金近
    山区好山区富，山区好，山区到处都是宝，栗子核桃树上挂，竹笋药材地里掏；金银铜铁和煤块，埋在地下等你找。谁来找宝贝，就是勘探队，今年找到今年开，好多工厂办起来。
    麦穗长一倍黑石头，一块块，刚从山上采下来，石头软松松，像泥又像煤，石煤送进化肥厂，做出最好的肥料来，施到麦田里，麦穗长一倍。
    牧童　（外二首）
  　刘饶民牧童的歌声最美，牧童的鞭声最脆。早上唱起红太阳，赶上羊群出村庄。中午唱开百样花，赶散羊群满山洼。晚上唱出满天星，赶回羊群进圈中。歌声落了鞭声起，羊群如云走万里。歌声起了鞭声落，羊群滚滚似黄河。
    小小园艺家一树开了百样花，红橙黄绿似彩霞。是谁本领这么大？我们小小园艺家。一棵小树结百果，苦甜酸涩全不差。是谁本领这么能？我们小小园艺家。
    小粪筐小粪筐，小粪叉，每天出门带上它。狗粪臭，马粪脏，见了就往筐里装。你拾金，他拾银，不如跟我去拾粪。粪是宝，庄稼好，昆仑山比粮堆小！
