    The Functions of Tea

    Tea leaves contain the elements of theine, tannin, aromatic oils, proteins, carbohydrates, enzymes, pectin, pigments, vitamins, and minerals.

    Theine, also known as caffeine, is an alkaloid with a stimulating effect. It has the functions of refreshing the mind, strengthening the heart, diuresis, and stimulating the central nervous system and gastric gland cells.

    Tannin can dissolve fat and coagulate the protein bodies of bacteria to kill them.

    There are many benefits to drinking tea, but do not drink too much or too strong tea. For some people, too much and too strong tea can put the nerves in an excited state and easily cause insomnia. People with heart disease, hypertension, and excessive stomach acid should drink less and drink lighter tea. (Example)

    茶的功能
    茶叶含有茶素、单宁、芳香油、蛋白质、碳水化合物、酵素、果胶素、色素、维生素和矿物质等成分。
    茶素又叫咖啡因，是种有刺激作用的生物碱。它有提神、强心、利尿、兴奋中枢神经和胃腺细胞的功能。
    单宁能溶解脂肪，能凝固细菌的蛋白体而杀死细菌。
    喝茶的好处很多，但不要喝得太多、太浓。对某些人，太多太浓会使神经处于兴奋状态、易失眠。患心脏病，高血压症和胃酸过多的人，以少喝和喝淡些为宜。（举）
