Writing History Together With Those Who Create History
    History Department Faculty and Students of Hangzhou University Go to the Countryside to Study and Research Modern History

    (Our dispatch) Hangzhou University's History Department faculty and students are going into actual production struggles to study and research modern history. In labor, they are writing history together with the working people.

    Last September, after achieving victory in improving teaching, over one hundred and seventy first and fourth-year students and teachers from the History Department of Hangzhou University moved the "Modern Chinese History" course to Xindeng County, Zhejiang. The faculty and students joined the production teams of the Xindeng People's Commune, eating, living, and laboring alongside the workers and peasants, while simultaneously studying modern history and conducting scientific research. Through investigation and research, and by personally participating in productive labor, they further realized that the laboring people are the creators of history. Together with the workers and peasants, they compiled five books, including "History of the Land Reform Movement in Guantang Village," "History of the First Production Cooperative in Zhejiang Province," "One Year of the Great Leap Forward in Shuangyan," "History of the Tonglu No. 3 Steel Plant," and "Ode to the Great Leap Forward in Guantang," truthfully reflecting the history of the struggle of the people of Xindeng County in engaging in socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past decade since liberation.

    Cadres and masses of the Xindeng People's Commune actively participated in the work of writing their own history, enthusiastically providing the faculty and students with rich historical materials and research clues. In addition to giving reports and analyzing the situation at the time for the faculty and students, Guantang Production Team Leader Qiu Gaoyuan and Xinyan Production Team Leader Xu Guirong personally held discussion meetings for them, mobilizing the masses to write memoirs. In order to help the faculty and students compile the history of the land reform movement, the peasants of Guantang Village wrote one hundred and fifty big-character posters recalling the land reform struggle in five days, becoming important materials for compiling this book. Among them, the section on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was written by Ruan Xiaobao, a peasant from Guantang.

    The vast majority of the students who went to the countryside this time were freshmen who had just entered school. Under the leadership of the Party General Branch of the History Department, the faculty and students emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, and boldly threw themselves into the work of compiling modern history. In the process of compiling, they conducted in-depth investigations and research, visited peasants and cadres separately, held discussion meetings, and collected a large amount of materials; at the same time, they conscientiously studied relevant books and periodicals published since liberation, and studied the relevant principles, policies, and theoretical articles on land reform, agricultural cooperativization, etc., combining investigation and research, study, and the writing of modern history. They also read the initial drafts chapter by chapter to the peasants, soliciting opinions. (Huang Keping) (Attached picture)

    同创造历史的人一起编写历史
    杭州大学历史系师生下乡学习和研究现代史
    本报讯　杭州大学历史系师生，到实际生产斗争中去，学习和研究现代史。他们在劳动中和劳动人民一起编写历史。
    去年9月下旬，杭州大学历史系一、四年级一百七十多个学生和教师，在改进教学获得胜利的基础上，把“中国现代史”搬到浙江新登县去上。师生们参加了新登人民公社的生产队，同工农群众同吃同住同劳动，同时学习现代史和进行科学研究工作。他们经过调查研究和亲身参加劳动生产，进一步体会到劳动人民是历史的创造者。他们和工农群众一起编写了“官塘村土改运动史”、“浙江省第一个生产合作社史”、“双堰大跃进的一年”、“桐芦第三钢铁厂史”和“官塘大跃进之歌”等五本书，真实地反映了新登县人民在解放十年来从事社会主义革命和社会主义建设的斗争历史。
    新登人民公社的干部和群众积极参加了编写自己历史的工作，热情地为师生们提供丰富的历史资料和研究线索。官塘生产队长丘高元和新堰生产队长许桂荣除了为师生们做报告分析当时情况外，还亲自为他们召开座谈会，发动群众写回忆录。官塘村农民为了帮助师生们编写土改运动史，在五天里写了一百五十张回忆土改斗争的大字报，成为编写这本书的重要资料，其中关于镇压反革命一节是由官塘农民阮小保写的。
    这次下乡的学生绝大部分是刚入学的新生。师生们在历史系党总支领导下，解放思想，破除迷信，大胆地投入编写现代史工作中去。在编写过程中，他们一面深入调查研究，分头访问农民、干部，召开座谈会，搜集大批资料；一面认真地翻阅解放以来有关书籍报刊，学习有关土地改革、农业合作化等方面的方针政策和理论文章，使调查研究、学习和编写现代史结合起来。他们还把初稿逐章逐节念给农民听，征求意见。（黄客萍）（附图片）
