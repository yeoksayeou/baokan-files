Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is strengthening its leadership over workers' education. With the leap forward in production, workers' learning has also seen vigorous development.

Since liberation, along with the increasing development of industrial production, workers' education in Tianjin has also developed rapidly. It has made even more significant and rapid progress since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of January, the number of workers' schools has increased from 220 in 1957 to 989, and the number of workers participating in learning has increased from 159,000 to more than 460,000. Approximately 68% of the city's young and middle-aged workers are participating in learning, with some districts reaching over 90%. Most of these schools are part-time, and some factories and enterprises, under the leadership of the Party committee, are actively experimenting with a number of work-study schools. There are various types of workers' schools, including those run by workshops, factories and enterprises, jointly run by several small and medium-sized factories, run by districts, and run by enterprise systems. The city as a whole, and even some large enterprises, have established complete workers' education systems from primary school to university. In the city's education system, workers' education has become an important base for cultivating intellectuals from the working class.

The most important reason for the relatively smooth development of workers' education in Tianjin is the Party's unified leadership. The city has carried out a series of ideological education campaigns regarding the development of workers' education from top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party. Most factories and enterprises have also launched mass airing of views, big debates, making workers' education a cause for the whole Party and the whole people. The Party committee also conducted pilot projects at each level to gain experience and gradually promote it. From the Municipal Committee to the District Committee and the vast majority of grassroots Party committees, the secretaries took the lead in unifying and leading the efforts of all parties, grasping both production and education. In the Municipal Committee, a secretary was assigned to take charge of worker-peasant education, and workers' education and production were regularly studied together at the Party committee meetings. Finally, under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the city organized the forces of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, as well as education, industry, finance, and trade, and established a special agency to manage workers' education. The eight districts in the city and the factories and enterprises under them have also established professional agencies to lead workers' education at each level under the direct leadership of the Party committee. The vast majority of enterprises and institutions have Party committee responsible cadres and administrative heads concurrently serving as leaders of workers' schools. A unified system for leading workers' education has been formed from the city to the district, factory, section, and group, overcoming some decentralized phenomena in workers' education.

Party organizations at all levels in Tianjin also directly grasp the teaching of workers' schools. Responsible cadres from the city and districts go deep into the grassroots to conduct investigations and research, help some grassroots units summarize experience in running schools, improve teaching, and organize relevant parties to exchange experience. Dozens of units in the city have, under the leadership of the Party committee, mobilized teachers and the masses to experiment with revising teaching materials and flexibly arrange teaching methods to make teaching serve politics and production. Except for a few industries with seasonal production, the vast majority of workers' schools in the city have persisted in learning during the leap forward in production, resulting in a situation of double leap forward in production and education.

Party organizations at all levels in Tianjin also directly lead the solution of the problem of teachers in workers' education. In addition to rectifying the original teaching staff, they also opened up sources of teachers from all aspects, cultivated and trained them, and sent new blood to the workers' teaching staff. At present, there are more than 8,500 full-time and part-time teachers in workers' schools in the six districts of the city. The relevant parties also held training courses to organize new teachers to concentrate on learning the Party's policies, teaching principles, and teaching methods in a relatively short period of time. In order to cultivate and improve teachers in a long-term and planned way, the city and districts have established teachers' spare-time colleges, worker-peasant normal schools, and single-subject specialized study classes. Some large factories and enterprises also run their own normal classes. The city is currently starting to run a number of normal schools to train workers' school teachers, and set up worker-peasant classes attached to higher normal schools, gradually establishing a base specializing in training teachers for workers' schools.

Now, the new semester of Tianjin's workers' schools has begun. Before and after the start of the school year, from the Municipal Committee to the districts and grassroots Party organizations, meetings were held many times to rectify workers' education and study this year's work. The specific study and production and life issues of workers were arranged in a unified manner. The teaching time of workers' schools throughout the city was uniformly stipulated. Any temporary suspension of classes due to production needs must go through certain examination and approval procedures. According to this regulation, various industries have specifically arranged different learning methods and times. (Attached picture)

    为广大职工开辟广阔的学习园地
    天津建立各种职工业余学校
    新华社天津12日电　中共天津市委加强对职工教育的领导，随着生产的跃进，职工学习也有了蓬勃的发展。
    天津市在解放后随着工业生产事业的日益发展，职工教育也迅速发展起来，在1958年大跃进以来更是突飞猛进，有重大的发展。截至1月底不完全的统计，职工学校已由1957年的二百二十所增至九百八十九所，参加学习的职工人数由十五万九千人增至四十六万多人，全市青壮年职工参加学习的约占68％左右，有的区达90％以上。这些学校绝大部分是业余的，也有部分工厂企业在党委领导下积极地试办了一批半工半读学校。各类职工学校有车间办的，工厂企业单位办的，几个中小厂联合办的，区办的，企业系统办的；有普通学校，也有专业技术学校。全市以至部分大型企业单位都建立了从小学到大学的完整的职工教育体系。在全市教育事业中，职工教育已成为培养工人阶级知识分子的一个重要基地。
    职工教育在天津市比较顺利的发展，最主要的原因是由于党的统一领导。全市曾经从上到下，从党内到党外，进行了一系列的关于开展职工教育的思想教育，在大部分的工厂企业单位还发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，使职工教育成为全党全民的事业。党委又层层试点，取得经验，逐步推广。从市委到区委和绝大多数的基层党委都由书记挂帅，统一领导各方面的力量，既抓生产，又抓教育。在市委，有一个书记分工掌握工农教育，在党委的会议上经常对职工教育和生产一起进行研究，最后全市又在市委领导下把工会、共青团以及教育、工业、财经贸易等各方面力量组织起来，建立了专门管职工教育的机构。全市八个区和下面所属工厂企业单位，也都在党委直接领导下层层建立起领导职工教育的专业机构，绝大多数企业单位并由党委负责干部和行政负责人分别兼任职工学校的领导职务。从市到区、厂、工段、小组，形成领导职工教育的统一体制。克服了职工教育工作中某些分散现象。
    天津各级党组织也直接抓职工学校的教学，市、区有关负责干部，分别深入基层进行调查研究，帮助一些基层单位总结办学经验，改进教学，组织有关方面交流经验。全市已有几十个单位在党委领导下发动教师群众试行修改教材，灵活地安排教学方法，使教学为政治为生产服务。全市职工学校除一部分生产有季节性的行业外，绝大部分在生产跃进中都坚持了学习。出现了生产和教育双跃进的局面。
    天津市各级党组织还直接领导解决职工教育当中的师资问题，除了对于原有教师队伍进行整顿外，还从各方面开辟师资来源，培养训练，为职工教师队伍输送新的血液。现在市内六个区的职工学校，已有专职和兼职教师八千五百多人。有关方面还举办训练班，组织新教师在较短的时间内集中学习党的政策、教学原则和教学方法。为了长期有计划地培养提高师资，市、区成立了教师业余进修学院、工农师范学校、单科性的专科学习班等，有些大的工厂企业也自办师范班。全市目前正在着手办一批培养职工教师的师范学校，在高等师范学校附设工农班，逐步建立一个专门培养工人学校教师的基地。
    现在，天津市职工学校新的学期已经开始。在开学前后，从市委到各区、基层党组织都多次开会，对职工教育进行了整顿，研究了今年的工作。对职工的学习和生产、生活等问题具体地进行了统筹安排。统一规定了全市职工学校教学时间。凡因生产需要暂时停课的，得经过一定批审手续。根据这一规定，各个行业具体地安排了不同的学习办法和时间。（附图片）
