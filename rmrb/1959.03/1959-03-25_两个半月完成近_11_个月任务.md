    The Great Leap Forward's Pace
    Completing Nearly 11 Months of Work in Two and a Half Months
    In the No. 2 Mechanical Workshop of the Dalian Diesel Engine Factory, young lathe operators Liu Jishan, Yan Yongshen, and Wang Guoren, working in shifts on the same lathe, cooperated closely and helped each other. From January to the first half of March this year, they completed ten months and twenty-three days' worth of work, averaging four days' production task per person per day. They proposed to guarantee the completion of thirty-two months' worth of work this year.
    All three of them are members of the Communist Youth League. They work in shifts on the same six-foot belt-driven lathe. This machine tool is over thirty years old, and some people used to think that it couldn't be used to create high output. However, during the Great Leap Forward last year, the three of them completed two years' worth of work. This year, their machine tool is responsible for processing five types of parts, all of which are relatively precise parts for diesel engines. The three of them cherish every minute of their time in production. Each of them arrives at the factory an hour early to prepare tools and arrange the day's production tasks, reducing downtime. They also researched methods of measuring while the machine is running, saving auxiliary time. For example, they can produce sixty more screws per day when turning screws. At the same time, they also increased the machine's rotational speed, greatly maximizing the equipment's potential. In addition, they cooperated closely, supporting each other, with the previous shift creating conditions for the next shift, ensuring that each shift had complete tools, no errors, and high output. When they encountered technical difficulties in production, in addition to consulting with veteran workers in their own workshop, they also went to fraternal factories on Sundays to learn from their experiences, and promptly applied what they learned to production. In February of this year, after learning from the experiences of Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande at the Dalian Shipyard, they made a "roller ball tool" fixture, which greatly improved production efficiency when processing "protective cap cover" components.
    Hard work and ingenuity are good measures for them to improve production efficiency. They have achieved tooling of processing, high-speed multi-tool cutting, and standardization of measurement samples, which has greatly increased daily output. In an example of high output in early March, Liu Jishan completed fifty-two minutes and thirty seconds' worth of work in just eight hours.

    大跃进的步伐
    两个半月完成近11个月任务
    大连柴油机厂机械二车间在同床换班生产的青年车工刘积善、阎永深、王国恩，紧密协作，团结互助，从今年1月到3月上半月完成了十个月零二十三天的工作量，平均每人每天完成了四天的生产任务。他们提出今年要保证完成三十二个月的工作。
    他们三个人都是共青团员，在同一台六尺皮带车床上换班生产。这台机床已有三十多年的历史，过去有些人认为用这台机床不能创造高产。可是在去年的大跃进中，他们三个人完成了两年工作量。今年他们的机床担负了五种部件的加工任务，而且都是柴油机上比较精密的零件。他们三个人在生产中珍惜每分钟的时间，每人都提前一个小时来厂准备工具和安排当天的生产任务，减少停台时间，他们还研究了不停车量活的操作方法，节约了辅助时间。如车螺丝每天就可以多生产六十个。同时他们也提高机床回转速度，大大发挥了设备潜力。此外，他们紧密协作，互相配合，上一班为下一班创造条件，做到班班工具全、班班无差错、班班创高产。他们在生产中遇到技术困难时，除了向本车间老工人请教外，星期天就一块儿到兄弟厂学习经验，并及时把学来的东西用到生产中去。今年2月份，他们到大连造船厂学习了朱维勤和张连德的经验以后，做了一个“滚珠刀”胎具，加工“护帽罩”部件时，使生产效率提高了不少。
    苦干巧干是他们提高生产效率的良好措施，他们实现了加工胎具化、切削多刀高速化、量活样板化，日产量大大提高。3月上旬一次高产日里，刘积善只用八小时的时间就完成了五十二点三十分钟的工作量。
