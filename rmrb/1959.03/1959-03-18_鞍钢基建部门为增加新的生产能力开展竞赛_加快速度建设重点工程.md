Anshan, March 17th (report from our newspaper) To ensure a greater leap forward in steel production this year, the broad masses of workers in the capital construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel are actively launching a competition, striving to complete the forty-five construction projects focusing on coking, mining, and ore dressing this year in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, the workers in the capital construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel built a giant blast furnace, five giant open-hearth furnaces, and a large number of small indigenous blast furnaces at the fastest construction speed. The early completion of these projects played a significant role in ensuring the great leap forward in steel production at Anshan Iron and Steel last year. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel is building these forty-five projects focusing on coking, mining, and ore dressing, all of which directly serve the greater leap forward in steel production this year, and the construction scale is still quite large. In order to solve the urgent need for coke production this year, in addition to building several modern coke ovens, construction of a number of simple coke ovens is also being accelerated. Except for one modern coke oven which will be completed and put into production next year, the remaining large and small coke ovens are planned to be completed and put into production within the year. In terms of mining and ore dressing, there are the new Gongchangling magnetic separation plant project with an annual output of 3.3 million tons of concentrate powder, and the expansion projects of Dong Anshan, Gongchangling, Yingtaoyuan and other mines. After the completion of these mine expansion projects, 8.9 million tons of iron ore can be produced annually. A large part of the raw materials and fuel used in Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production this year will rely on the production of this batch of construction projects put into production.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction tasks, Anshan Iron and Steel has transferred a group of workers and cadres from the production and capital construction departments to support key projects; construction units are also accelerating the training of new construction forces. Various construction sites have also launched competitions to vigorously save raw materials and solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment through self-reliance. In order to speed up the construction progress, the workers of many units are vigorously engaging in small-scale mechanization combining indigenous and foreign methods, and building simple construction machinery. After the workers of construction units such as the Steel Rolling Engineering Company and the Second Engineering Team completed their construction plans for February ahead of schedule, they have now put forward guarantees to complete the construction plans for March ahead of schedule, and once again set off a new construction competition. The entire builders of the newly built Gongchangling magnetic separation plant construction site recently set up a battle formation to launch a competition, determined to work hard for three months to ensure that part of the magnetic separation plant system will be completed and put into production in the second quarter. They used this as a condition to challenge all the workers on the construction site of the new No. 4 giant coke oven. The workers on the construction site of the No. 4 giant coke oven refused to be outdone and immediately accepted the challenge, setting off a red flag competition between classes and groups. Now, the bricklaying project of the furnace body of the No. 4 giant coke oven has been completed ahead of schedule, and equipment installation has begun. The refractory brick masonry project of this giant coke oven, due to the fast bricklaying competition led by the Cui Shangchang group and the Ma Yanhou and Tan Yuchang groups, accelerated the bricklaying speed. The entire furnace body bricklaying project took only thirty-eight days, shortening the construction period of the same scale coke oven in the past by half. The workers at the construction site of the No. 4 coke oven are determined to carry out construction at a faster speed, ensure baking the oven in March, and strive to complete all production by the end of April.

    鞍钢基建部门为增加新的生产能力开展竞赛
    加快速度建设重点工程
    本报鞍山17日电　为保证今年钢铁生产更大跃进，鞍钢基本建设部门的广大职工正积极开展竞赛，力争多快好省地完成今年的以炼焦、矿山和选矿为重点的四十五项建设工程。
    在去年大跃进中，鞍钢基本建设部门的职工曾以最快的建设速度新建成一座巨型高炉、五座巨型平炉和大批小洋高炉。这批工程提前建成，对保证鞍钢去年钢铁生产大跃进曾经起了重大作用。今年，鞍钢建设这批以炼焦、矿山和选矿工程为重点的四十五项工程，都是直接为今年钢铁生产更大跃进服务的，建设规模仍然相当大。为了解决今年生产焦炭的迫切需要，除新建几座现代化焦炉外，同时还抓紧建设一批简易炼焦炉。这些新建焦炉除有一座现代化焦炉将在明年建成出焦以外，其余大小焦炉都计划在年内建成出焦。在矿山和选矿方面，有新建每年可产三百三十万吨精矿粉的弓长岭磁选厂工程和东鞍山、弓长岭、樱桃园等矿山扩建工程，这些矿山扩建工程完成后，每年可以生产八百九十万吨铁矿石。鞍钢今年钢铁生产所用的原料、燃料，很大一部分就将依靠这批建设工程投入生产后来生产。
    为了保证完成今年的基本建设任务，鞍钢已从生产和基建部门抽调一批工人和干部，支援重点工程；施工单位也在加速培养新的施工力量。各个工地也都展开了大力节约原材料、自力更生地解决原材料和设备不足的困难的竞赛。为了加快施工进度，许多单位的职工都在大闹土洋结合的小型机械化，大造简易施工机械。轧钢工程公司、第二工程队等几个施工单位的职工在提前完成2月份的施工计划以后，现在他们又提出提前完成3月份施工计划的保证条件，再次掀起新的施工竞赛。新建的弓长岭磁选厂工地的全体建设者们最近摆开阵势展开竞赛，决心苦干三个月，保证在第二季度内使磁选厂的部分系统建成投入生产。他们以此作为条件，向新建四号巨型焦炉工地的全体职工提出挑战。四号巨型焦炉工地的职工们不甘示弱立即应战，掀起班与班、组与组的红旗竞赛。现在，四号巨型焦炉的炉体砌砖工程已经提前完工，开始设备安装了。这座巨型焦炉的耐火砖砌筑工程，由于崔尚长小组和马延厚、谭玉昌两个小组带动展开快速砌砖竞赛，加快了砌砖速度，全部炉体砌砖工程只用三十八天，比过去建设同样规模焦炉的工期缩短了一半。四号焦炉工地的职工，决心以更快速度进行建设，保证在3月份内烘炉，争取4月末全部建成出焦。
