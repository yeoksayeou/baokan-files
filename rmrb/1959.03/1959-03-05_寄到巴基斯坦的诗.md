A poem sent to Pakistan
Liu Lanshan
	On a balmy spring night, in Beijing, I think of a caged eagle;
	Although the Karakoram Mountains soar into the clouds,
	I can always hear your breathing;
	Faiz Ahmed Faiz, you wear shackles,
	yet hold an olive branch in your mouth.
	That is the sword for defending peace,
	you tirelessly circle with it in your beak,
	no matter how great the storm you encounter,
	you never abandon it.
	Faiz, this is you yourself,
	this is the poem that you send over the Pamir peaks.
	Where dark clouds press low against the chest,
	you lift your head high, full of spirit;
	in the deep night, you carry a wind and rain lamp,
	calling for the dawn that gallops from the other side of the valley;
	You stand by the rolling Indus River,
	and the Kirthar Mountains bow to you in respect.
	Just because of this, you are guilty,
	what awaits you is a dark and damp prison.
	Son of Pakistan, Faiz wears shackles,
	yet holds an olive branch in his mouth.
	I hear people emerging from the windowless mud huts
	reading your poems under the palm trees.
	Brave people of Pakistan, peace fighter,
	I am reading your poem aloud;
	"Not many days left"! Truly not many days
	left, what use is that tattered prison door?
	It is about to break and fall, and you are about to soar,
	I am ready to listen to the sound of your wings spreading.
	A intoxicating spring night is taking place here,
	I stand at the door looking at the distant guests.
	Oh, you cannot even return to your own home,
	so how can you come to Beijing again to write poems!
	"Release him! Release him! Release him!"
	Karachi, listen, this voice comes from the whole
	world!
		February 1959, Beijing

    寄到巴基斯坦的诗
    刘岚山春风煦煦的夜晚，在北京我想念着一只被囚的鹰；喀喇昆仑山虽然高触云天，但我总是听得见你的呼吸；费兹·艾哈迈德·费兹，你戴着脚镣，衔着橄榄枝。那是保卫和平的宝剑，你衔着它不倦地飞旋，无论遇见多么大的风暴，你从来不把它放弃。费兹呵，这就是你自己，这就是你越过帕米尔山峰的
  诗。在黑云低压到胸口的地方，你高抬着头颅，气宇轩昂；在深夜里，你提着风雨灯，呼唤从山谷那边驰来的黎明；你站在滚滚的印度河边，吉尔达尔山低头向你致敬。就因为这样，你有罪了，迎接你的是又黑又湿的牢监。巴基斯坦的儿子，费兹戴着脚镣，衔着橄榄枝。我听见从无窗的小土屋走出来
  的人们正在棕榄树下读你的诗的
  声音。勇敢的巴基斯坦人，和平战士，我正在大声读着你的诗；“没有几天了”！真正没有几天
  了，那破破烂烂的牢门顶什么用？它就要断落，你就要飞腾，我已准备好收听你展翅的声
  音。醉人的春夜正在这里进行，我站在门口望着远方的客人。哦哦，你连自己的家也回不去，又怎能重来北京城头题诗！“放他出来！放他出来！放他
  出来！”喀喇蚩，听吧，这声音来自全
  世界！
