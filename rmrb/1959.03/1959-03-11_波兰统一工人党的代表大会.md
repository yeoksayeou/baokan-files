\tMarch 10th, the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party opened in Warsaw. This is a day of major political significance in Poland's development along the socialist path.

\tThe Polish United Workers' Party, inheriting the glorious traditions of the Polish Communist Party and the Polish Workers' Party, has made tremendous achievements in consolidating the people's democratic power, building the foundations of socialism, strengthening the unity of the international communist movement, and striving for the relaxation of the international situation since its establishment in 1948.

\tIn 1945, the Polish Workers' Party, established on the basis of the original Polish Communist Party, led the Polish People's Armed Forces, and, in coordination with the Soviet Red Army which was advancing victoriously westward to eliminate the main forces of fascist Germany, liberated the motherland and established the Polish People's Republic. After the establishment of the People's Republic, the Polish Workers' Party organized the National Democratic Front, united all political parties and groups in Poland that supported socialism, led the people in implementing revolutionary democratic reforms, and carried out domestic economic recovery work, healing the devastation left by the war. In December 1945, the First Congress of the Polish Workers' Party formulated the task of consolidating the people's democratic system and striving for the victory of the Polish socialist revolution. The Polish Workers' Party effectively carried out this task in the following years and achieved great success.

\tFrom December 15 to 21, 1948, the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party held a unification congress, which was also the First Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party. The congress adopted a resolution on the political and organizational merger of the two parties and the establishment of the Polish United Workers' Party based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The ideological declaration issued by the congress stated: "We are merging to become the vanguard of the Polish proletariat, the leading force for the Polish people to advance towards socialism, and the Polish contingent of the international democratic socialist front; we are merging in order to guide Poland towards the complete victory of the cause of social justice, towards the elimination of all forms of human exploitation—that is, towards socialism." The congress put forward the great historical task of building socialism in Poland, formulated the tasks of the people's government, and adopted the Six-Year Plan for the development of the national economy (1950-1955). The resolution of the First Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party showed that Poland had, in a very short historical period, healed the wounds left by the fascist German invasion of Poland and had begun planned socialist construction work.

\tFrom March 10 to 17, 1954, the Polish United Workers' Party held its Second Congress. The congress summarized the implementation of the first four years (1950 to 1953) of the Six-Year Plan. The summary showed that during this period, due to the basic completion of the main task of national industrialization, Poland had changed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country with huge and growing economic potential. Industrial output in 1953 had increased 3.6 times compared to 1938, and the proportion of socialist industry in total industrial output had reached more than 99%. The congress also formulated ways to further develop the national economy and improve the living standards of the working people. The congress adopted a new party constitution. The party constitution pointed out that the primary task of the Polish United Workers' Party at that time was: to build a socialist society, to continuously develop production on an increasingly perfect technological basis to ensure the continuous improvement of the material welfare and culture of the working class and all urban and rural workers, to carry out patriotic and internationalist education for all members of society, and to strengthen the strength of the people's state and the defense of the motherland.

\tSince the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party in March 1954 until 1958, the Polish people have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction. In 1955, Poland successfully completed the Six-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and the total output value of socialist industry had increased by 185% compared to 1949, the year before the plan. Based on the achievements already made in the Six-Year Plan, Poland implemented the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) starting in 1959. During the first three years of the Second Five-Year Plan, Poland's national economy developed rapidly. During this period, the average annual growth rate of socialist industry reached about 9.5%, and the average yield of grain per hectare in the three years also exceeded the target of the Five-Year Plan. The tremendous efforts made by the Polish people in implementing the national economic development plan have enabled Poland to take a big step towards reaching the level of the most economically developed countries in Europe. Currently, Poland has exceeded the world average level in terms of the average per capita output of basic products.

\tThe resolution on convening the Third Party Congress was adopted by the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in October 1958. The resolution of the Twelfth Plenary Session pointed out that the Third Congress will focus on discussing the instructions on developing the national economy during the period from 1959 to 1965, the instructions on the party's policy in rural areas, and the draft resolutions on amending the constitution of the Polish United Workers' Party. The Polish people greeted the convening of the Party Congress with unparalleled political enthusiasm and a high tide of production competition, and expressed their support for the Party's instructions on the Seven-Year Plan. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, Poland's industrial production will increase by 80%, and agricultural production will increase by 30%; the successful completion of this plan will enable Poland to catch up with and surpass some capitalist countries in Western Europe in terms of the output of important products and the consumption of necessities per capita, and will also provide a great contribution to the growth of the economic strength of the entire socialist camp. Therefore, the convening of this congress will lay a solid foundation for Poland to achieve greater achievements in the cause of building socialism. (Su)

    波兰统一工人党的代表大会
    3月10日，波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会在华沙开幕了。这是波兰沿着社会主义道路发展过程中具有重大政治意义的日子。
    波兰统一工人党继承了波兰共产党和波兰工人党光荣的传统，从1948年成立迄今，在巩固人民民主政权，建设社会主义基础，加强国际共产主义运动团结，争取缓和国际局势等方面都取得了巨大的成就。
    1945年，在原来波兰共产党的基础上建立的波兰工人党，领导波兰人民武装力量，配合着乘胜西进消灭法西斯德国主力部队的苏联红军，解放了祖国，并建立了波兰人民共和国。在人民共和国成立以后，波兰工人党即组织民族民主阵线，团结了波兰拥护社会主义的各个政党和团体，领导人民实行了革命的民主改革，进行了国内经济恢复工作，医治了战争留下来的百孔千疮。1945年12月，波兰工人党举行的第一次代表大会拟定了为巩固人民民主制度和为争取波兰社会主义革命而胜利斗争的任务。波兰工人党在以后的几年中有成效地执行了这个任务，取得很大成就。
    1948年12月15日至21日，波兰工人党和波兰社会党举行统一代表大会，这也是波兰统一工人党的第一次代表大会，这个大会通过了关于两党实行政治上和组织上合并并根据马克思列宁主义思想原则成立波兰统一工人党的决议。这次代表大会发表的思想宣言说：“我们合并成为波兰无产阶级的先锋队，波兰人民向社会主义前进的领导力量，国际民主社会主义阵线的波兰队伍；我们合并，为的是要引导波兰走向社会正义事业的彻底胜利，向消灭一切人剥削人现象——即向社会主义前进。”代表大会提出了在波兰建成社会主义的伟大历史任务，拟定人民政权各项工作任务，通过了发展国民经济的六年计划（1950—1955）。波兰统一工人党第一次代表大会的决议表明，波兰已经在极短的历史期间，医治好了因法西斯德国侵略波兰而遗留下来的伤痕，并且开始了有计划的社会主义建设工作。
    1954年3月10日至17日，波兰统一工人党举行了第二次代表大会。这次大会总结了六年计划头四年（1950年至1953年）的执行情况。总结表明，在这段期间，由于国家工业化主要任务的基本完成，波兰已从一个落后的农业国变为一个具有巨大的、日益增长的经济潜力的社会主义工业国。1953年的工业产量已增为1938年的三点六倍，社会主义工业在工业总产量中所占的比重已达到99％以上。这次代表大会还拟定了进一步发展国民经济和提高劳动人民生活水平的办法。代表大会通过了新的党章。党章指出波兰统一工人党当时首要的任务是：建立社会主义社会，在愈益完善的技术的基础上不断发展生产以保证不断提高工人阶级和全体城乡劳动者的物质福利和文化，对全社会成员进行爱国主义和国际主义教育，加强人民国家的实力和祖国的国防。
    自从1954年3月波兰统一工人党举行第二次代表大会到1958年为止，波兰人民在社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。1955年，波兰胜利地完成了发展国民经济的六年计划，社会主义工业总产量已比计划前一年的1949年增加了185％。在六年计划已获得的成就的基础上，从1959年开始，波兰又实行了第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）。在第二个五年计划的头三年期间，波兰的国民经济有了进一步的迅速发展。这一期间，社会主义工业每年的平均增长率达到9.5％左右，三年中的谷物每公顷平均产量也已超过了五年计划的指标。波兰人民在实现发展国民经济计划中所作出的巨大努力，已使得波兰朝着达到欧洲经济最高度发展的国家的水平大大地跨进了一步。目前，波兰在基本产品产量按人口平均计算方面已超过了世界产量的平均水平。
    关于召开第三次党代表大会的决议是1958年10月波兰统一工人党第十二次中央全会通过的。十二中全会的决议指出，第三次代表大会将着重讨论关于在1959年到1965年期间发展国民经济的指示，关于党在农村中的政策的指示以及修改波兰统一工人党党章等的决议草案。波兰人民以无比的政治热情和掀起生产竞赛高潮来迎接了党代表大会的召开，并表示拥护党的关于七年计划的指示。七年计划规定，到1965年，波兰的工业生产将增长80％，农业生产将增长30％；胜利完成这个计划，就将使波兰在按人口平均计算的重要产品的产量和生活必需品的消费量方面，分别赶上和超过西欧的一些资本主义大国，而且也将为整个社会主义阵营的经济实力的增长提供很大的贡献。所以，这次代表大会的召开，将为波兰在建设社会主义事业中取得更大的成就奠定巩固的基础。（苏）
