In the high-yield wheat plot of Xiwang Village, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, hundreds of commune members are working intensely. Some are ridging, some are fertilizing, some are watering… After seven days of hard work, they will have rolled the entire 3,600 mu of wheat fields in the team once, and then they will fight for another six days to achieve garden-like management.

Liu Shuqi, the deputy captain of the production team, carefully measured the ridges and inserted markers with a ruler, examining them left and right, afraid of even the slightest deviation. To the east of the high-yield plot, loud singing could be heard from time to time. This was a group of young women transporting soil and building ridges. They really had a lot of energy. More than twenty people worked hard for a whole day to build more than a li of five water channels, forming an irrigation network.

It's truly managing wheat like embroidery! Wang Shuhe, Xu Wenkai, Wang Ruizeng, and other old farmers nearing their sixtieth year, are the experts in farming in this village. This time, they voluntarily contracted the task of adjusting the boundaries and straightening the ridges for the land consolidation. Look how careful Uncle Xu Wenkai is! If there is even a small clod of earth in any ridge of wheat, he will level it again and again with an iron rake. He doesn't even let go of the weeds, picking them out one by one with his hands, as if he were dressing up his daughter for her wedding, so meticulously and carefully. Look at the ridges he has leveled, they are as smooth as a mirror. The ridge backs are stepped on again and again, and patted with a mattock, straightened perfectly and made solid. Accompanied by the lush green wheat seedlings, it is truly beautiful.

Secretary Yin of the management district, led cadres from five production teams to visit this high-yield plot. Immediately, the people fighting on this plot became excited and worked even harder. The girls sang songs they had composed themselves while working to welcome the visitors. They sang: "More vigorous than Wu Song, as meticulous as a doctor. The ridges are straight as lines, the ground as flat as a mirror. Sweat more now, and in summer the wheat will become a mountain."

    管麦如绣花
    在河北高阳县西王庄的小麦丰产方里，有好几百名社员，在紧张地劳动着。有的打畦、有的施肥、有的浇水……。他们经过七天的奋战，在全队三千六百多亩麦田普轧一遍后，又要鏖战六天，实现园田化。
    生产队副队长刘书奇，拿着标尺，细心地量畦插标，左端详右察看，惟恐有一点不直。丰产方的东边，不时传来嘹亮的歌声，这是一群年轻的姑娘，正在那里运土、打畦。她们可真有股子干劲，二十多人大战一天，修好了一里多长的五条水渠道，形成了一个灌溉网。
    真是管麦如绣花！年近花甲的老农王书和、许文楷、王瑞增等，是这个村种地的能手。这次整方，他们自动承包了调埂整畦的任务。看，许文楷大伯多么细心！哪畦麦子有一点坷拉，他就要用铁耙平了再平。他对于草也不放过，一根一根地用手拣出来，真像是打扮闺女出嫁那么要好，那么仔细。再看他整过的畦，都像镜子那样的平整，畦背用脚踩了又踩，用铣拍了又拍，整的笔直，又牢靠。再陪衬上绿油油的麦苗，真是好看极了。
    管理区的尹书记，带着五个生产队的干部，到这块丰产方来参观。顿时，战斗在这块方的人们沸腾起来，干劲更足了。姑娘们一边劳动着一边唱起自己编的歌子，来欢迎参观的人们。她们唱道：“干劲赛武松，心细像医生。畦埂直如线，地面平如镜。这会多流汗，夏季麦成山。”
