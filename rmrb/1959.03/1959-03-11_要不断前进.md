　　To Keep Moving Forward

　　With achievements, it is often easy to become complacent. The important thing is to immediately and effectively overcome complacency when it is discovered.

　　Because the cadres and people of Changshu County promptly overcame the complacency that had just emerged, they greatly stimulated people's enthusiasm. The originally set production targets were considered too low, and the measures being implemented were felt to be insufficiently advanced. They put forward the resounding slogan of "Working hard for one hundred days to harvest two thousand catties of wheat," and production became even more vigorous.

　　This fact once again tells us that as long as we are not satisfied with the achievements already made and promptly prevent and overcome complacency, we can continue to move forward.

    要不断前进
    有了成绩，往往容易产生自满情绪。重要的是在发现有自满情绪的时候，要立即有效地去克服它。
    常熟县干部和人民，由于及时克服了刚刚露头的自满情绪，大大激发了人们的干劲，原来订出的增产指标已经嫌太低了，正在实行的措施也感到不够先进，他们提出了“大干一百天，三麦收双千”的响亮口号，生产变得更红火了。
    这个事实再一次告诉我们，只要不满足已经取得的成绩，及时防止和克服自满情绪，就能不断前进。
