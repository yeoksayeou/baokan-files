    The "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is a summary of the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, and also a summary of the experiences of crop cultivation throughout history. To ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production, it is necessary to fully implement this "Eight-Character Constitution." How can we comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture? The Qinxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province, in light of the local agricultural characteristics, has concretized the "Eight-Character Constitution" and implemented it on a large scale with leadership and planning. This approach is worth promoting.

    The Qinxian County Committee, in light of the local natural conditions and the characteristics of agricultural activities, linked the "Eight-Character Constitution" with the local situation, thereby making the "Eight-Character Constitution" concrete, localized, and popularized. Because the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is a summary of the agricultural production experience of many regions over many years, and it has been elevated to a theory. It is a universally applicable truth for agricultural production. However, in each region, its application must combine theory with practice. The Qinxian County Committee, in accordance with the twelve months and twenty-four solar terms of the year, formulated specific plans for each period, taking one or several characters of the "Eight Characters" as the center to drive other work, and set specific requirements, indicators, measures, and completion times. This provides a reliable foundation for the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution." Some places have further concretized a certain character in the "Eight-Character Constitution." For example, some places have formulated five more characters in the "work" character aspect: "repair (mend), reform (revolutionize), promote (popularize), return (lost tools must return to the team), protect (safeguard)." All these creative methods of implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" have achieved remarkable results.

    Practice also tells us that to ensure the comprehensive and thorough implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," on the one hand, it is necessary to form a mass movement, and on the other hand, it is necessary to combine it with scientific research work. This requires a serious and meticulous organizational work, establishing and cultivating a scientific and technological team. In this way, in the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," there will be both a broad mass ideological foundation and a scientific and technological foundation, which will make the technical management of agricultural production more and more detailed and better and better.

    All localities should creatively implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture in a variety of ways, so that it adapts to various specific situations and exerts greater power.

    创造性地运用“八字宪法”
    李玉秀
    农业“八字宪法”，是去年大跃进的经验的总结，也是对有史以来种庄稼的经验的总结。要保证农业生产更大地跃进，必须全面地执行这“八字宪法”。如何全面地实行农业“八字宪法”呢？中共山西省沁县县委针对当地农事特点，把“八字宪法”具体化，有领导、有计划、大规模地实行“八字宪法”，这种做法是值得提倡的。
    沁县县委针对当地自然情况和农事活动特点，把“八字宪法”和当地的情况挂钩，从而使“八字宪法”具体化、地方化、群众化。因为农业“八字宪法”，是总结了许多年来，许多地区的农业生产经验，并把它上升为理论。它对农业生产来说，是放之四海皆准的真理。但是，在每一个地区应用它就必须把理论和实际结合起来。沁县县委按照全年十二个月二十四个节气，制定了每个时期以“八字”中的一个字或几个字为中心带动其他工作的具体计划，订出具体要求、指标、措施和完成的时间。这就使“八字宪法”的贯彻执行有了可靠的基础。还有些地方把“八字宪法”中的某个字，又进一步具体化。例如有的地方在“工”字方面，又订出“修（补）、改（革）、推（广）、归（丢失的工具要归队）、保（护）”五字。所有这些创造性地贯彻执行“八字宪法”的办法，都收到了显著效果。
    实践还告诉我们：要使“八字宪法”全面地彻底地执行，一方面要形成群众运动，另方面要和科学研究工作结合起来。这就要做一番认真、细致的组织工作，建立和培养科学技术队伍。这样，在执行“八字宪法”中，既有广泛的群众思想基础，也有科学技术基础，就会使农业生产的技术管理工作越做越细，越做越好。
    各地都应该创造性地以多种多样的方法贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，使它适应各种不同的具体情况，发挥更大的力量。
