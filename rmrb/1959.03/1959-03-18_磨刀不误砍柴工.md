    "Sharpening the Knife Doesn't Delay the Woodcutting"
     Huang Ying
    Last year, I participated in labor training in the countryside. During the wheat harvest, I bought a new scythe that hadn't been sharpened. When I started to sharpen it, I felt it took a lot of time and delayed the wheat cutting. After sharpening it for a while, I went to the field with the farmers to cut wheat. But because the sharpening wasn't sufficient, the blade wasn't sharp enough, and coupled with my unfamiliarity with the wheat-cutting technique, I cut very slowly. So I decided to spend time sharpening it properly. Afterwards, I cut very swiftly, and the efficiency was greatly improved. Although sharpening the knife took some time, it didn't delay the wheat cutting; on the contrary, it sped it up. As the saying goes, "Sharpening the knife doesn't delay the woodcutting." This saying is very reasonable and thought-provoking.
    Sharpening the knife is for woodcutting, and woodcutting is the purpose of sharpening the knife. If there is no woodcutting, there is no need to sharpen the knife; if one wants to cut wood but is unwilling to sharpen the knife, the wood cannot be cut or cannot be cut quickly. When the knife is being sharpened, sharpening and woodcutting seem contradictory, but fundamentally, they are consistent.
    Many things in the world are like sharpening a knife, seemingly delaying wheat cutting or woodcutting, but in fact, they are for better wheat cutting or woodcutting. The relationship between tool reform and production is like the relationship between sharpening the knife and woodcutting.
    I have some material at hand: Peng Shangshu and others, laborers at the Danxi Reservoir construction site in Zhejiang, successfully trial-produced a caterpillar-type motorized transfer machine after eight setbacks. During the trial production process, they encountered many technical difficulties. Some people said it was a waste of time, and others said it was getting worse and worse, advocating not to continue. However, Peng Shangshu and his comrades did not lose heart. With the support of the Party committee, they finally succeeded in the trial production, increasing work efficiency by 150 times.
    Tool reform is often like sharpening the knife, seemingly time-consuming and labor-intensive, but in reality, it promotes production and develops production. Spending time researching and trial-producing initially is precisely to avoid wasting time in future production, so the initial "waste" should not be counted as waste. If Peng Shangshu and his comrades had listened to the opponents and were afraid of "wasting" time, giving up the trial production, then the increase in work efficiency by 150 times would not have occurred. From this perspective, wouldn't not carrying out tool reform delay production? Wouldn't not sharpening the knife delay woodcutting instead?
    Tool reform is to production as sharpening the knife is to woodcutting, extremely important. Marxism believes that the development of human society depends first and foremost on the development of productive forces; and one of the important signs of the development of productive forces is the improvement of production tools. "The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist." ("Marx and Engels Collected Works") Now, atomic energy is giving us a socialist-communist era. This shows that the improvement of tools promotes the development of society. Terms such as "tool reform" and "technical innovation" were coined by our generation, but in fact, they have existed since the beginning of mankind. Our ancestors initially used stone tools, then bronze and iron tools, and later invented the steam engine and electricity, and now atomic energy. From ancient times to the present, for thousands of years, mankind's ability to live a civilized life today cannot be without gratitude to our ancestors for constantly carrying out tool reforms. Otherwise, we would still be living in caves in the mountains, drinking blood.
    However, our ancestors did not realize the enormous role that tool reform would have on social development, so their tool reforms could not consciously form a mass movement like ours. This kind of movement is also impossible in a society where the working people do not have the power to be masters of their own affairs. Now, we have understood the enormous role of tool reform in social development, and our working people have also become masters of their own affairs. Thus, a magnificent mass movement of tool reform has taken shape in our country and is gaining momentum.
    "Since we are enthusiastic about the cause of communism, we must first be enthusiastic about developing our productive forces." ("Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes") Let us—those who are enthusiastic about the cause of communism—hold even higher the banner of technological innovation!

    “磨刀不误砍柴工”
     黄荧
    去年我在农村里劳动锻炼，麦收时买了把未开口的新镰刀，磨刀时觉得磨起来很费时间，耽误割麦，磨了一会儿便和农民一起下地割麦去了。但磨的功夫不到，刀口不利，外加割麦技术不熟练，割得慢极了。于是我下决心花时间把它好好磨了一下，以后割起来麻利得很，工效大大提高。磨刀虽然花了点时间，却并没有耽误割麦，反而是加快了割麦。正如俗话所说：“磨刀不误砍柴工”。这话很有道理，耐人深思。
    磨刀为了砍柴，砍柴是磨刀的目的。如果不砍柴，刀便用不着磨；如果想砍柴而又不愿磨刀，柴是砍不成或者砍不快的。刀在磨时，磨刀和砍柴显得有矛盾，然而它们在根本上是一致的。
    天下有很多事像磨刀一样，看起来好像耽误了割麦、砍柴，其实是为了更好地割麦、砍柴。工具改革和生产的关系，就像磨刀和砍柴的关系。
    手头有个材料：浙江淡溪水库工地民工彭尚枢等试制履带式机动转扬机，经过八次挫折才成功。在试制过程中，遇到多次技术上的困难，于是有人说这是浪费时间，也有人说是越搞越糟，主张不要搞了。但是，彭尚枢他们没有灰心，在党委支持下，终于试制成功，提高工效一百五十倍。
    工具改革往往和磨刀一样，看来费时费工，而实际上却是推动了生产、发展了生产的。当初花点时间研究、试制，正是为了在以后生产上不浪费时间，所以当初的“浪费”，是不能算作浪费的。倘若彭尚枢他们听信了反对者的意见，也怕“浪费”时间，放弃了试制，那么，提高工效一百五十倍的事便不会出现。从这个意义上说，不进行工具改革，岂不耽误了生产？不磨刀岂不反而耽误了砍柴？
    工具改革对于生产，犹之乎磨刀对于砍柴，十分重要。马克思主义认为，人类社会的发展，首先取决于生产力的发展；而生产力发展的重要标志之一，就是生产工具的改进。“手碾给你一个以领主为首的社会，蒸汽碾给你一个工业资本家的社会。”（“马克思恩格斯全集”）现在，原子能正给我们一个社会主义—共产主义的时代。足见工具的改进，促进了社会的发展。“工具改革”、“技术革新”这类名词，虽则是我们一代人想出来的，而它们实际上在有人类以来，早就有了。我们的祖先开头用石制的器具，后来用铜制铁制的器具，以后又发明了蒸汽机和电力，以至于现在的原子能。从古到今，千年万载，人类到今天能过着文明的生活，不能不感谢我们的祖先不断地进行了工具改革。否则，我们今天也还会过着穴居山野、茹毛饮血的生活。
    然而，我们的祖先并未意识到工具改革对社会发展会有如此巨大的作用，因而他们的工具改革，不可能像我们这样自觉地形成群众运动。这种运动，在劳动人民没有当家作主的社会，也不可能有。现在，我们已经懂得了工具改革对于社会发展的巨大作用，我们的劳动人民也已经当家作主，于是一个规模壮阔的群众性的工具改革运动，已在我们的国家里形成起来，而且声势越来越大了。
    “我们既然热心于共产主义事业，就必须首先热心于发展我们的生产力。”（“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”）让我们——热心于共产主义事业的人们，更高地举起技术革新的旗帜吧！
