Demanding Labor from Water
By our reporter Feng Dongshu

Some people say that it is too early to carry out electrification in the countryside, but the commune members in Hongtong County, Shanxi, have already seen the bright prospects of rural electrification. They say: "Building power stations is really beneficial; bright electric lights save labor; heavy work is done by machines; look in a few years, and grain and cotton will increase dozens of times."

　　Build Stations Wherever There is a Drop

By the end of January, Hongtong County had built 112 small hydroelectric power stations, with 26 more under construction. The total installed capacity of the completed power stations is 1,400 kilowatts. Some have already been equipped with generators and have begun to transmit electricity; others, due to a lack of generators, are using water power for cotton ginning, flour milling, and oil pressing. More than 90% of these hydroelectric and power stations in Hongtong County are built on irrigation canals. These canals not only have year-round water flow but also have considerable drops. Without affecting irrigation, stations are built wherever there is a drop, utilizing all available water power. The Ze Yuan Canal is 25 li long with a drop of 75 meters. Twenty-three stations have already been built on this main canal, and 97 more stations are planned on its branch canals.

　　Serving Production

Hongtong County's rural electrification movement began after August last year. At that time, due to the all-round Great Leap Forward, the labor force in the county became increasingly tight. After investigating and studying the county's water resources, the Hongtong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that fully utilizing water power was an effective way to solve the labor shortage. Therefore, they launched a "demanding labor from water" movement throughout the county. This movement was immediately supported by the masses. When the masses in Qinbi Village of Quting People's Commune saw that their village was not included in the first batch of hydroelectric power station construction plans published in the newspaper, they took the newspaper to the Party branch and asked the Party branch to talk to the county to approve Qinbi Village's participation in the first batch of station construction at all costs. After the masses' request was approved, the commune members voluntarily brought out their lime, bricks, timber, and tiles. After seventeen days of hard work, they built a 14-kilowatt power station and a 21-horsepower power station. The power of these two stations can drive two stone mills, two steel mills, and eight cotton gins, processing 3,500 catties of grain and ginning 8,000 catties of cotton per day. They can also be used for chopping straw, irrigating fields, and lighting. This freed up 150 laborers to transfer to the agricultural front.

In the rural electrification movement, Hongtong County paid attention to the construction policy of "serving production, being simple and crude." Many stations built power stations first without generators; some stations, after being built, started production in makeshift sheds made of straw because they had no factory buildings. As a result, all places with hydroelectric and power stations in the county quickly realized the mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing. These hydroelectric and power stations save about 10,000 laborers and 2,000 head of livestock per day in agricultural and sideline product processing and other production aspects.

　　Smashing Mysterious Views

"To carry out rural electrification, we must smash mysterious views," is a consistent view of several hydroelectric power station directors I met. It is said that when rural power stations started, some people were frightened by electricity, saying, "If we people who deal with dirt clods can generate electricity, that would be a strange thing!" At the beginning, people were sent everywhere to buy equipment. Purchasing agents traveled to Harbin, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and other cities, but returned empty-handed. What should be done? The Hongtong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to rely on the masses for self-reliance. The county committee entrusted the task of manufacturing water turbines to the workers of the iron and woodworking production cooperative in Hongtong County. These workers did not even know what a water turbine was in the past, but they still made wooden propeller-type water turbines according to the drawings provided by the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and quickly taught the manufacturing technology to the iron and woodworking workers of each commune, solving the county's water turbine problem for electrification. The most difficult thing was the generator. I visited the place where generators were manufactured. It was a small machine repair shop in an oil pressing factory. There were no planers or punching machines there. The workers melted scrap copper into copper water, cast it into copper strips, hammered it into copper sheets, cut it into thin copper strips, and finally drew it into copper wires, then welded them together, and then wrapped them with double-layer yarn to make yarn-covered wires; the wire packages were also completely hand-wrapped. The copper heads of the rectifiers originally required a fifteen-ton press, but they used a jack. All the technical data was borrowed, and there were no drawings. Now, in addition to lead wire, instruments, and adhesive wire, the workshop can manufacture all the parts of the generator itself. It has been officially named Hongtong County Motor Manufacturing Factory. It produces a 10-kilowatt generator every five days.

On the road to rural electrification, the people of Hongtong County have already taken the first step towards victory. (Attached picture)

In addition to providing lighting, they are mainly used for smelting steel, repairing agricultural tools, and processing agricultural and sideline products.

    向水要劳力
    本报记者  冯东书
    有人说农村现在搞电气化还为时太早，但是山西洪洞县的社员已经看见农村电气化的灿烂前景了。他们说：“建电站，真有利，电灯明亮省劳力，笨重活儿机器干，再过几年看一看，粮棉翻它几十番”。
          有落差就建站
    洪洞县到1月底，已经建起小型水力动力站一百一十二个，还有二十六个正在施工。建成的动力站总的装机容量是一千四百瓩，有的已经装上了发电机，开始输送电力；有的站因为缺乏发电机，就利用水动力在轧花、磨面、榨油。洪洞县的这些水电站和动力站，90％以上都是建立在灌溉渠道上的。这些渠道不仅常年流水，而且都有相当的落差，在不影响灌溉的情况下，哪里有落差，就在哪里建站，把所有能利用起来的水力都利用起来了。泽垣渠全长二十五里，落差七十五公尺，在这个干渠上已经建站二十三个，还准备在它的支渠上建站九十七个。
        为生产服务
    洪洞县的农村电气化运动，是在去年8月以后开始的。当时因为各方面都在大跃进，全县劳力日趋紧张，中共洪洞县委在调查研究了全县的水力资源以后，认为充分利用水力是解决劳力紧张的有效办法之一，于是就在全县开展了一个“向水要劳力”的运动。这个运动一开始就受到群众拥护。曲亭人民公社秦壁村的群众，看到报纸上公布第一批建立水电站的计划中没有他们村在内的时候，就拿着报纸去找党支部，要求党支部去县里谈一下，无论如何要批准秦壁村在第一批建站。群众的要求得到批准后，社员把自己家里的石灰、砖、木料、瓦主动拿出来，经过十七天苦战，建成了十四瓩电站一座，和二十一马力动力站一座。这两个站的动力能带动两盘石磨、两盘钢磨和八架轧花机，一天能加工三千五百斤粮食、轧八千斤棉花，还能铡草、浇地、照明用。这样就抽出了一百五十个劳力转到农业战线上。
    洪洞县在农村电气化运动中，注意了“面向生产，因陋就简”的建站方针。很多站没有发电机就先建动力站；有的站建起以后没有厂房，就先用秸秆搭起工棚开始生产。因而使全县所有有水电站和动力站的地方很快都实现了农副产品加工的机械化。这些水电站和动力站，在农副产品加工上和其他生产方面每天节约的劳力大约在一万人以上，节省的牲口达二千头。
      大破神秘观点
    “要搞农村电气化必须大破神秘观点”，这是我遇到的几个水电站站长一致的看法。据说开始搞农村电站，有的人就被电吓住了，说是“咱这些和土坷垃打交道的人，要是能搞得发了电，那才是怪事哩！”开始时，派人到处去买设备，采购员跑遍了哈尔滨、天津、上海、广州、重庆等城市，结果空手而回。怎么办呢？中共洪洞县委决心依靠群众自力更生。县委把制造水轮机的任务交给了洪洞县城里的铁木业生产合作社的工人。这些工人过去连水轮机是什么也不知道，但是他们还是根据山西省水利局提供的图纸，经过多次试制，制成了木质的旋桨式水轮机，并且迅速把制造技术传授给各公社的铁木业工人，解决了全县电气化的水轮机问题。最困难还是发电机。我到制造发电机的地方去参观过，那是一个榨油厂的小机修车间，那里没有刨床、冲车，工人们在把废铜化成铜水，铸成铜条，打成铜片，裁成细铜条，最后拔成铜丝再焊接起来，然后缠上双层纱就成了纱包线；线包也完全是用手工缠起来的。做整流子的铜头本来要用十五吨压力机，他们用的却是千斤顶。全部技术资料是借来的，一张图纸也没有。现在这个车间，除了铅丝、仪表和胶线外，发电机的全套零件都能自己造，它已经正式被命名为洪洞县电机制造厂。每五天生产一台十瓩的发电机。
    在农村电气化的道路上，洪洞县的人民已经迈开了胜利的第一步。（附图片）
    甘肃武山县已建成了十七座中小型水力、火力发电站，除供照明外，主要用于冶炼钢铁、农具修配和加工农副业产品等生产方面。图为洛门人民公社新建成的小型水力发电站的夜景。
