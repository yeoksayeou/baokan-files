    Firearms of the Ming Dynasty
    Liu Mianzhi
    Gunpowder was transmitted from China to Europe, Southeast Asia, Japan, and all parts of the world. By the 15th century, China was importing various gunpowder weapons from Annam (present-day Vietnam), Portugal, Japan, and other countries.

    The earliest firearms of the Ming Dynasty were introduced from Annam, called Shenji Guns and Cannons.

    Shenji guns and cannons were cast from refined copper or a mixture of raw and refined red copper. Some were made of iron, with Jian iron being the best, followed by Western iron. They came in various sizes. The larger ones were mounted on vehicles, while the medium and smaller ones were used with frames, stakes, or rests. They were essential equipment for military expeditions at the time. Emperor Chengzu of Ming attached great importance to this new weapon and specially organized a special force called the Shenji Camp, with a supervising eunuch. It was one of the three major battalions of the Beijing garrison.

    In the tenth year of Yongle (1412 AD), an order was issued to place five cannon mounts on the mountaintops from Kaiping to Huailai, Xuanfu, Wanquan, Xinghe, etc. In the twentieth year, additional installations were added in Datong, Tiancheng, Yanghe, and Shuozhou in Shanxi to defend against enemies (Ming History, Military Affairs).

    The first person to help Emperor Chengzu of Ming manufacture Shenji guns was Li Cheng from Annam (Shen Defu, "Ye Huo Bian").

    "Folangji" refers to present-day Portugal. In 1517 AD, Portuguese merchant ships came to Guangdong for trade. He Ru, a patrol inspector in Baisha, bought their cannons, and these cannons were called Folangji. They were made of copper, five or six feet long, with the larger ones weighing over a thousand pounds and the smaller ones weighing a hundred and fifty pounds. They had a large belly and a long neck, with a long hole in the belly containing five sub-cannons. Gunpowder was loaded into the belly, and the range reached over a hundred zhang [unit of length].

    In 1519 AD, when Prince Chenhao of Ning rebelled, Lin Jun, a local official in Putian, Fujian, obtained the news and sent people to make models of Folangji and the gunpowder formula out of tin overnight, and sent it to commander Wang Shouren. By the time it arrived, Wang Shouren had already captured Chenhao, so it was not used. (Wang Shouren, "Yangming Ji Yaowen Hua Ji San Gengchen Book of Folangji Anecdotes.") It was not until 1529 AD that they were officially manufactured, called "General," and distributed to various border towns for defense (Ming History, Military Affairs).

    When Japanese pirates invaded China, "birds-beak guns" were introduced from Japan. Tang Shunzhi described its form, saying:

    Folangji, sub-mother cannons, quick guns, and birds-beak guns were all new weapons of the Jiajing era, with the birds-beak gun being the latest and most powerful. The gun uses copper or iron as the barrel, with a wooden shaft mounted on the barrel. Lead bullets are stored inside, and can pierce through people and horses. The firing method involves holding the gun in hand and lighting the fuse. Male and female sights are mounted on the back of the barrel. The eye aligns with the sights, and the sights are aligned with the target to be shot. It is accurate and will hit the enemy's eyebrows and nose without fail. It is faster than the Shenji gun and more accurate than the quick gun, making it the best of the firearms (Jingchuan Waiji, Volume 2, "Memorial on Training Troops in Jizhou Garrison").

    Song Yingxing's "Tiangong Kaiwu" records the manufacturing method of the birds-beak gun in detail, stating that birds within thirty steps would have their feathers and flesh shattered when hit. Beyond fifty steps, the shape would be intact. Beyond a hundred steps, the power of the gun would be weak and ineffective.

    Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, "Red Barbarian cannons" were introduced. They were more than two zhang [unit of length] long, weighing up to three thousand pounds, capable of breaking through city walls, and the sound could be heard for dozens of miles. In the first year of Tianqi (1621 AD), the Ministry of War suggested recruiting Jesuit missionaries residing in Macau, Luo Ruwang, Yang Mano, and Long Huamin, who were skilled in artillery, to manufacture guns and cannons in the mainland. After they were manufactured, they were named "General," and officials were sent to offer sacrifices to the cannons. In 1630, Long Huamin and Bi Fangji were sent to Macau to buy cannons and recruit gunners. Westerners Lu Ruohan and Gongsha de Xilao led several Westerners with guns and cannons to answer the call to participate in the battles of Ningyuan, Zhuozhou, and other places (Ming History, Military Affairs; Huang Bolu, "Zhengjiao Fengbao," pages 14, 15).

    The several ancient cannons displayed to the left and right of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City in Beijing are relics of the Ming-Qing wars.

    明代的火器
    刘勉之
    火药从中国传到欧洲、东南亚、日本和世界各地。到十五世纪，中国又从安南（今越南）、葡萄牙、日本等国输入各种用火药制成的火器。
    明代最早的火器是从安南传来的，叫作神机枪、炮。
    神机枪、炮用熟铜或生、熟赤铜相间铸造。也有用铁的，最好的是建铁，其次是西铁。大小不等，大的用车发，次和小的用架用桩用托，是当时行军的要器。明成祖非常重视这个新武器，特别组织了一支特种部队，叫神机营，并设监枪太监，是京军三大营之一。
    永乐十年（公元1412）下令从开平到怀来、宣府、万全、兴和等山顶，都安放五个炮架，二十年又增设了山西大同、天城、阳和、朔州等地以御敌（明史兵志）。
    第一个帮助明成祖制造神机枪的是安南人黎澄（沈德符野获编）。
    佛郎机即今葡萄牙。公元1517年葡萄牙商船到广东通商，白沙巡检何儒买了他们的炮，就叫这种炮作佛郎机。用铜制造，长五、六尺，大的重一千多斤，小的重一百五十斤，巨腹长颈，腹部有长孔，藏子铳五个，装火药在腹中，射程达到一百多丈。
    公元1519年宁王宸濠反，福建莆田乡官林俊得到消息，连夜派人用锡作了佛郎机的模型和火药配方，送给统帅王守仁，送到的时候，王守仁已经把宸濠俘掳了，没有用上。（王守仁阳明集要文华集三庚辰书佛郎机遗事。）到公元1529年才正式制造，叫作大将军，发给各边镇用于防守（明史兵志）。
    倭寇侵扰中国，又从日本传入鸟嘴铳。唐顺之记其形制说：
    佛郎机、子母炮、快枪、鸟嘴铳都是嘉靖时的新武器，鸟嘴铳最后出，也最厉害。铳以铜、铁为管，用木杆装管。中贮铅弹，所击人马洞穿。其点放之法，用手握铳，点燃药线。管背安雌雄两臬（瞄准器），用眼睛对臬，用臬对准所要射击的目标，对准了才发射，要打敌人的眉毛鼻子，没有一失。快于神机枪，准于快枪，是火器中的最好的东西（荆川外集卷二条陈蓟镇练兵事宜）。
    宋应星天工开物记鸟铳的制造方法很详细，说鸟雀在三十步内被铳击，羽肉皆碎。五十步外方有完形，百步以外，铳力微弱，便不行了。
    到明末，又传入红夷炮，长两丈多，重的到三千斤，能够打穿城墙，声闻数十里。天启元年（公元1621）兵部建议，招寓居澳门，精于火炮的西洋人罗如望、阳玛诺、龙华民来内地制造铳炮。制成后命名为大将军，并派官祭炮。1630年又派龙华民、毕方济到澳门买炮和招募炮手，西洋人陆若汉、公沙的西劳带领西洋人多名带铳炮应募，参加宁远、涿州等战役（明史兵志，黄伯禄正教奉褒页十四、十五）。
    现在陈列在北京故宫午门左右阙门的几尊古老的大炮，就是明清战争的遗物。
