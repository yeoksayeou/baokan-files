    Commending the Advanced
    Hua Ren
    People's communes in various parts of Jiangsu Province and Yongshun County in Hunan Province, based on summarizing last year's agricultural production, used the method of appraisal to select thousands of good cadres and good commune members, thereby further inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses and promoting current production.
    Carrying out appraisal work is one of the methods to promote advanced experience. These experiences can be found not only in advanced regions and advanced individuals, but also in those regions and individuals that are temporarily lagging behind. They are not all backward, and there are many things worth learning. Which experiences are good and why they are good will be specifically presented to people in the appraisal process, which is convenient for learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses. At the same time, through appraisal activities, advanced regions and advanced individuals will be praised and will inevitably play a greater role in their enthusiasm and strive for greater honor. For regions and individuals that are temporarily lagging behind, this is also a spur, so that they are determined to catch up and learn from the advanced.
    Appraisal is a good way to encourage the morale of the masses and move from victory to victory. Objective things are constantly changing, and the situation of advanced and backward is constantly changing. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, this change is rich and colorful, and each time there will be fresher content and better experience. The responsibility of the leadership lies in grasping new situations, frequently conducting appraisals with the spirit of continuous revolution, and promoting the movement to develop to a higher stage. In this way, the waves behind push the waves ahead, so that we can continue to move forward and achieve continuous victories. Many areas in Jiangsu Province have gradually formed a system in this regard. The Yancheng Satellite Commune in this province conducted 24 appraisals last year, so that cadres and the masses always maintained a vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit.
    In the appraisal, we should be realistic, "appraise" appropriately, and "compare" appropriately. In this way, we should conduct a specific analysis of things, and put units or individuals with roughly the same conditions together for "appraisal" and "comparison." In the process of appraisal, special attention should be paid to developing positive factors and encouraging greater enthusiasm among the masses. In the Great Leap Forward last year, we accumulated many experiences in leading appraisal work. Now, we should systematically summarize them and better use these experiences to serve the new leap forward climax.

    表扬先进
    华仁
    江苏省各地人民公社和湖南省永顺县，在总结去年农业生产的基础上，运用评比的办法，评选出成千上万的好干部和好社员，从而进一步鼓舞了群众的干劲，推动了当前生产。
    开展评比工作，是推广先进经验的方法之一。这些经验，不仅在先进地区、先进人物身上可以找到；就是那些暂时处于后进的地区和人物，也不是一切都落后的，也有许多值得学习的地方。哪些经验好，为什么好，在评比过程中，都会具体地摆在人们面前，便于取长补短，相互学习。同时，通过评比活动，先进地区和先进人物受到赞扬后，必将发挥更大的积极性，争取更大的荣誉。对于暂时落后的地区和人物，也是一种鞭策，使得他们下决心迎头赶上，向先进看齐。
    评比是鼓舞群众士气、从胜利走向胜利的良好形式。客观事物是在不停地变化着，先进和落后的情况在不断地变化着。在大跃进的形势下，这种变化是丰富而多彩的，每一次都会有更新鲜的内容，更好的经验。领导的责任，就在于抓住新的情况，以不断革命的精神经常进行评比，促进运动向更高的阶段发展。这样，后浪推前浪，就能使我们不断前进，不断取得胜利。江苏省不少地区在这方面已经逐渐形成制度。这个省的盐城卫星公社，去年就进行了二十四次评比，使干部和群众经常保持着旺盛的革命斗志。
    在评比时，应当实事求是，“评”得恰当，“比”得合适。这样，就应当对事物进行具体的分析，把条件大体相同的单位或个人放在一块“评”，放在一块“比”。在评比的过程中，应当特别注意发扬积极因素，鼓舞群众更大的干劲。去年一年大跃进中，我们积累了领导评比工作的多方面的经验，现在，应当系统地加以总结，并更好地运用这些经验为新的跃进高潮服务。
