From the Readers

    Welcome "Pocket Editions"
    Yizhi Mei, Hulin County, Heilongjiang

    Recently, I was very happy to see that the People's Literature Publishing House has published a set of small literary series. This kind of small-sized literary book is indeed needed by readers.

    In recent years, our books have made great progress in terms of cover layout, binding, etc. However, the issue of book size does not seem to have attracted the attention of the publishing industry.

    We often see promotional content such as "pocket-sized, easy to carry" in the advertisements for some mass manuals and dictionaries, which shows that the masses like small books. "Pocket editions" are both small and exquisite, and can be put in a shirt pocket; it is so good and convenient to take it out at any time and read a few pages! Why can't we publish more 64-open small books? If we can selectively publish some "pocket editions" of well-known literary works so that readers can carry them with them and make full use of their rest time to "learn some literature", this would be a great merit, and it can also save a lot of paper.

    欢迎“袖珍本”
    黑龙江虎林县　伊之美
    最近，看到人民文学出版社出版了一套文学小丛书，感到十分欣喜。像这种开本很小的文学书籍，对于读者来说确是很需要的。
    近年来，我们出的书籍，无论在封面版式、装帧等方面，均有了很大的进步。但是书籍的开本大小问题，似乎还是没有引起出版界的重视。
    我们常在一些群众性手册、辞书的广告上见到“袖珍本，携带方便”等宣传内容，可见群众是喜欢小本书的。“袖珍本”既小巧又精萃，衬衣口袋里就可放下；随时掏出，看上几页，这多好多方便啊！为什么我们不能多出一些64开本小书呢？如果能把某些烩炙人口的文学作品酌情出些“袖珍本”，让读者可以随身携带，充分利用休息时间“大家学点文学”，这是功德无量的事，而且还可以大量节约纸张。
