    Iraq and the Baghdad Pact

    The Republic of Iraq announced on the 24th that it was formally withdrawing from the Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact Organization was an aggressive military bloc cobbled together by US and British imperialism in the Middle East. This treaty was concluded on February 24, 1955, and the countries participating in this aggressive organization were: Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Iran, and the United Kingdom.

    The United States is not nominally a formal participant in the treaty, but in fact, before the establishment of this military bloc, the United States had been working behind the scenes to piece together this treaty organization. After the establishment of this group, it actively supported and manipulated it, becoming the de facto commander of the Baghdad military bloc. The United States has a permanent representative stationed at the headquarters of this treaty organization and sends "observers" to attend all sessions of the council. At the second meeting of the Council in April 1956, the United States formally joined the Economic Committee and the "Anti-Subversion Committee" of the Baghdad Pact Organization; at the third meeting of the Council in 1957, it announced its participation in the Military Committee. After the victory of the Iraqi revolution, the government of the Republic of Iraq took control of the secret documents of the Baghdad Treaty Group, including the US-proposed invasion plan, the joint military plans of the countries participating in this group, and the list of special agents and spies deployed by the so-called "Anti-Subversion Committee" under this group. According to Middle Eastern newspapers, the Baghdad Treaty Group, under the command of the United States and Britain, carried out many despicable activities, so that the countries concerned had to beg the Iraqi government not to publish these documents.

    Iraq was the only Arab country in the Baghdad military bloc; US and British imperialism regarded Iraq, ruled by the Faisal dynasty, as the cornerstone of the Baghdad Treaty Group. The treaty was named after Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, and the treaty headquarters was also located in Baghdad. After the establishment of this military bloc, US and British imperialism more actively used Iraq to carry out aggressive activities against Middle Eastern countries. In April 1957, when the United States instigated a coup to subvert the Jordanian nationalist government, Turkey and the former Iraqi reactionary government stationed troops on the borders of Jordan and Syria, respectively, to threaten them; in August 1957, when the US conspiracy to subvert the national independent government of Syria was revealed, Turkey and the former Iraqi reactionary government again assembled troops on the Syrian border in an attempt to attack. However, the Iraqi revolution broke the backbone of the Baghdad Pact.

    The freedom- and independence-loving people of Iraq waged a resolute struggle against the Baghdad Treaty Group. In the spring of 1952, the Iraqi people held extensive demonstrations to oppose joining the Middle East Command. In 1956, on the first anniversary of the signing of the Baghdad Pact, the Iraqi people launched extensive protest demonstrations demanding that the government withdraw from the Baghdad Pact. As soon as the Republic of Iraq was established, it announced its opposition to imperialism, its support for the principles of the Bandung Conference, and the closure of the offices of the Baghdad Treaty Organization in Iraq. Now, the government of the Republic of Iraq has officially announced its withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, giving another heavy blow to the imperialist military bloc in the Middle East.

### 伊拉克和巴格达条约

    伊拉克和巴格达条约
    伊拉克共和国于24日宣布正式退出巴格达条约。巴格达条约组织是美英帝国主义在中东拼凑的一个侵略性军事集团。这个条约是在1955年2月24日缔结的，参加这个侵略性组织的国家是：土耳其、伊拉克、巴基斯坦、伊朗和英国。
    美国在名义上不是条约的正式参加国，然而事实上在这个军事集团成立之前，美国一直在幕后为拼凑这个条约组织而努力，在这个集团成立之后，它更积极加以支持和操纵，并成为巴格达军事集团的事实上的指挥者。美国在这个条约组织的总部派有常驻代表，并派遣“观察员”出席理事会的历届会议。在1956年4月理事会第二次会议上，美国正式参加了巴格达条约组织的经济委员会和“反颠复委员会”；在1957年理事会第三次会议上，又宣布参加军事委员会。伊拉克革命胜利以后，伊拉克共和国政府掌握了巴格达条约集团的秘密文件，包括美国所提出的侵略方案、参加这个集团的国家的联合军事计划以及这个集团所属的所谓“反颠复委员会”所布置的特务间谍的名单。据中东国家报纸揭露，巴格达条约集团在美英指挥下干了许多卑鄙活动，以至有关国家不得不央求伊拉克政府不要公布这些文件。
    伊拉克是巴格达军事集团里唯一的阿拉伯国家；美英帝国主义把费萨尔王朝所统治的伊拉克，看作是巴格达条约集团的基石。这个条约就以伊拉克的首都巴格达命名，条约总部也设在巴格达。在这个军事集团成立之后，美英帝国主义更积极利用伊拉克对中东国家进行侵略活动。1957年4月，当美国策动政变颠覆约旦民族主义政府的时候，土耳其和前伊拉克反动政府分别陈兵约旦和叙利亚边境，进行威胁；1957年8月，当美国颠复叙利亚民族独立政府阴谋被揭露的时候，土耳其和前伊拉克反动政府又在叙利亚边境集结军队企图进攻。但是，伊拉克革命把巴格达条约的脊骨给打断了。
    爱好自由和独立的伊拉克人民为反对巴格达条约集团进行了坚决的斗争。1952年春，为反对参加中东司令部，伊拉克人民举行了广泛的示威游行。1956年，巴格达条约签订一周年的时候，伊拉克人民又发动了广泛的抗议示威游行，要求政府退出巴格达条约。伊拉克共和国一成立，就宣布反对帝国主义，拥护万隆会议原则，并封闭了在伊拉克的巴格达条约组织的办事处。现在，伊拉克共和国政府正式宣布退出巴格达条约，给帝国主义在中东的这个军事集团又一次沉重打击。
