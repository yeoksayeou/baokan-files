    High Output, Good Quality, Many Varieties
    Jilin Chemical Company Launches Technical Revolution to Ensure Doubled Production
    (Our correspondent from Changchun, 20th) The Jilin Chemical Industrial Company is launching a mass movement centered on technological revolution to double the production of basic chemical and organic synthetic chemical products in order to support national industrial and agricultural production.
    This year, the company will produce over a hundred kinds of chemical products, including important chemical raw materials such as calcium carbide, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, caustic soda, and methanol, organic synthetic chemical products such as chloroprene rubber, polyvinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, and polyacrylonitrile, as well as dyes, dye intermediates, and pharmaceutical products necessary for people's lives. After earnestly studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the staff and workers of all factories under the company have established the concept of "the whole country as a single chessboard." They are determined to ensure that the national chemical products urgently needed will double or treble the output of last year and increase by more than 30 new varieties, moving towards the direction of high output, good quality, and many varieties.
    Currently, the staff and workers of various factories are vigorously engaged in technological revolution, starting with analyzing the current production situation to identify problems and seize key points, and proposing leap-forward measures for their respective units. Then, "three-in-one" groups of cadres, technicians, and workers are organized to conduct special research, and technical measures are compiled to be implemented on schedule.
    Based on summarizing mass experience, the company has also proposed raising the degree of mechanization and automation as the main goal of the technological revolution. To achieve this goal, on the one hand, technical levels are improved by improving operating methods, and the mechanization and automation capabilities of the original equipment are fully utilized; on the other hand, new technical measures are proposed to improve the production process of certain backward processes, so as to multiply production capacity, improve labor productivity, and reduce product costs. According to this goal of technological revolution, the staff and workers of the acetic acid workshop of the Jilin Calcium Carbide Factory plan to make full use of remote instrument control in the short term, which can save about one-third of the operators. Based on the characteristic of strong continuity of chemical industry production, the Jilin Dyestuff Factory pays attention to guiding the masses to find ways to change intermittent production into continuous production. According to tests, this can increase equipment utilization by more than ten times. In addition, auxiliary processes mainly based on manual operation in various factories, such as loading, unloading, and handling processes that occupy a large amount of labor, will greatly promote operation mechanization and carry out tool reform campaigns to save a large number of workers.

### 产量高  质量好  品种多  吉林化学公司大闹技术革命确保产品翻番

    吉林化学公司大闹技术革命确保产品翻番
    本报长春20日电　吉林化学工业公司正在掀起一个以技术革命为中心的群众运动，使基本化学和有机合成化学产品翻番，支援全国工农业生产。
    这个公司今年要生产出上百种化工产品，其中包括电石、硫酸、硝酸、醋酸、烧碱和甲醇等重要化工原料，氯丁橡胶、聚氯乙烯、三氯乙烯和聚丙烯腈等有机合成化工产品，以及人民生活必需的染料、染料中间体和药用产品。公司所属各厂在认真学习了六中全会文件以后，树立了“全国一盘棋”的思想，决心保证国家急需的化工产品，在去年的基础上翻一番到两番，并增加三十余种新品种；向产量高、质量好、品种多的方向迈进。
    目前，各厂职工正在大闹技术革命，从分析当前生产状况入手找问题，抓关键，提出本单位的跃进措施，然后组织干部、技术人员、工人“三结合”小组进行专门研究，再编出技术措施，按期实现。
    这个公司还在总结群众经验的基础上，提出了以提高机械化和自动化程度作为技术革命的主要目标。为了实现这个目标，一方面，通过改进操作方法提高技术水平，充分发挥原有设备的机械化和自动化能力；另一方面，提出新的技术措施，改进某些落后工序的生产流程，以便成倍地提高生产能力，提高劳动生产率，降低产品成本。吉林电石厂醋酸车间的职工根据这个技术革命的目标，计划在短期内将仪表远距离控制充分利用起来，这样就可以节省三分之一左右的操作人员。吉林染料厂根据化学工业生产连续性强的特点，注意引导群众想办法，把断续生产改为连续生产。据试验，这样可以把设备利用率提高到十数倍。此外，各厂以手工操作为主的辅助工序，如占用大量劳动力的装卸搬运工序，将大搞操作机械化，开展工具改革运动，以节省大批劳动力。
