Turning Over the "Black Pot Bottom"
    Tan Qinglu

    The People's Daily's front-page headline on March 25th reported that various regions in Shaanxi Province are "learning from Ba Fu and catching up with Ba Fu." "Ba Fu" refers to the Ba Fu Village Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province. Ba Fu Village was originally a place with barren land and impoverished people. In 1956, this village was incorporated into the local advanced agricultural production cooperative, but the cooperative often had to allocate grain and seeds from other villages with higher production levels to support them. Now things are different. It's still the same production team, but it has now become a model for the vast number of farmers in neighboring counties to learn from and a goal to strive for.

    How did this change come about? It turns out that the people of the "Ba Fu Village Production Team" have turned over the "black pot bottom." "Black pot bottom" is a local dialect in the Guanzhong area, also called "scapegoating," meaning a lack of honor. Here, it refers to the fact that they always relied on others for grain and seed support. Support is a good thing from the perspective of the supporting party, representing the spirit of communist cooperation. However, for the supported party, it always feels uneasy and not very honorable. Turning over the "black pot bottom" means wiping away the dirt on one's face, shedding the label of backwardness, and making oneself honorable. Isn't the Ba Fu Village Production Team currently a shining mirror?

    How exactly is this "black pot bottom" turned over? In a word: high aspirations, great energy, and striving to improve one's own production level.

    The people of Ba Fu Village carried the "black pot" in the past. According to the news, there were two reasons: One was the barren land. The underground water source was 35 meters deep, and the entire village did not have a single well for irrigation before 1958. Half of the cultivated land had very poor soil quality, which the local people called "Cogon Grass Land." "Cogon Grass Land" is naturally considered a poor condition, but in my opinion, this is not the main reason. Because the natural conditions of the surrounding villages are not that different, why is it that other villages not only don't need support from others but can even spare grain and seeds to support it? The difference lies in their "high production level."

    Therefore, the other reason is the main one. This is the low production level, namely, the so-called "very extensive cultivation," "not plowing or fertilizing the land before sowing." With "Cogon Grass Land" and also "not plowing or fertilizing," how can you expect high yields? Doing so naturally makes it impossible not to carry the black pot. Therefore, the decisive factor is the production level. However, whether the production level can be improved depends first and foremost on whether people have the ambition to change nature and are willing to exert soaring energy to turn over the "black pot bottom."

    Farmers in some villages around Ba Fu Village, in addition to material support, also sent big-character posters to the people of Ba Fu Village, suggesting that they take good care of their crops. In this way, the help to the Ba Fu Village Production Team is much stronger than just providing grain and seed support. You see, they have become determined, holding continuous meetings of all commune members and enthusiastically debating whether they can quickly turn themselves around in production. As a result, all commune members mustered their strength and rolled up their sleeves for a great effort. In this way, many "Cogon Grass Land" areas have been transformed into irrigated land; "extensive cultivation" has become meticulous. And the yield per mu of wheat fields will also jump from 78 jin last year to 1,500 jin. Thus, the "black pot bottom" has been turned over, becoming a shining mirror. This is truly worthy of great learning and great progress!

    Therefore, "learning from Ba Fu" is not just learning their specific methods, but learning the "Ba Fu" spirit, which is to learn their ambition to change the landscape and reverse the situation, to learn their self-reliance and the heroic act of carrying a thousand catties of burden alone and advancing rapidly, to bring out their own soaring energy and improve their own production level according to the characteristics of their own regions, striving for excellence and seeking higher levels. In this way, the agricultural production level of our entire country will be further improved, and the face of our entire country will become even more radiant.

    翻“黑锅底”
    谭清露
    3月25日人民日报一版头条消息说：陕西省各地正在“学八福，赶八福”。“八福”就是陕西省蒲城县城关人民公社的八福村生产队。八福村原来是个地瘠民贫的地方。1956年，这个村并入了当地的高级农业生产合作社，但是社里经常要从其他生产水平较高的村庄拨口粮和籽种支援他们。现在不同了，还是他们这个生产队，如今却变成邻近各县广大农民学习的榜样，追赶的目标了。
    怎样变的？原来“八福村生产队”的人们，翻过了“黑锅底”。“黑锅底”是关中地区的一种方言，又叫“背黑锅”，意思是脸面不光彩，在这里指的是老靠别人支援口粮和籽种的事。支持对于支援的方面来说是共产主义协作精神，好事情；但是，对被支援的方面来说，总是觉得于心不安，不大光彩。翻“黑锅底”，意思就是擦去脸上的脏污，摘掉落后的帽子，使自己脸面光彩起来。八福村生产队，目前不就是一面光彩夺目的明镜了吗？
    这“黑锅底”是怎样的翻法呢？一句话：志高劲大，努力去提高自己的生产水平。
    八福村的人过去背了“黑锅”，据消息里说，原因有两个：一个是地瘠。地下水源深达三十五公尺，全村在1958年以前没有一口浇地水井，一半耕地土质很坏，当地群众称为“茅草之地”。“茅草之地”，自然算得是条件不好，但依我看这不是主要的。因为周围接壤的村庄的自然条件，比它并不会另有一番天地，可是为什么别的村庄不仅不要别人支援，反而抽出口粮和籽种来支援它呢？区别就在人家“生产水平高”。
    因此，另一个原因才是主要的。这就是生产水平低，即所谓“耕作非常粗放”，“土地下种前不翻地不施肥”。“茅草之地”而又“不翻地不施肥”，哪里能指望有高产呢？这样做，自然没法不背黑锅。所以起决定作用的是生产水平。但是，生产水平能不能提高，又首先决定于人是不是有改变自然的志气，肯不肯拿出冲天干劲来，把
  “黑锅底”翻过来。
    八福村周围一些村子的农民，除了物质支援外，他们还给八福村的人送去了大字报，建议他们好好务庄稼。这末一来，对八福村生产队的帮助，就比只是支援口粮和籽种强的多。你看，他们发奋起来了，连续举行全体社员大会，热烈辩论了能不能在生产上迅速翻身。结果全体社员憋足一股劲，挽起袖子大干一场。这样一来，不少“茅草之地”变成了水地；“粗放”变成了细致。而每亩麦田的产量，也要由去年的七十八斤跃上一千五百斤去了。于是“黑锅底”翻过来了，变成了一面光彩夺目的明镜。这真是值得大学和大赶的啊！
    因此，“学八福”就不只是学他们的那些具体作法，而是要学“八福”精神，这就是学习他们立志改变山河面貌扭转乾坤的雄心，学习他们自力更生独担千斤重担飞步前进的壮举，发挥出自己的冲天干劲来，按照自己地区的特点，精益求精，高益求高地去提高自己的生产水平。这样我们整个国家的农业生产水平会更加提高一步，我们整个国家的面貌也会更加光彩夺目。
