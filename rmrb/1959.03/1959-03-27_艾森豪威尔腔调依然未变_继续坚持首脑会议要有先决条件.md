Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 25th: According to TASS, Washington, March 25th: U.S. President Eisenhower discussed the prospects for negotiations with the Soviet Union and the results of his talks with British Prime Minister Macmillan at a press conference held on the 25th.

Reporters asked Eisenhower if he believed that his talks with Macmillan would lead to a relaxation of relations between Western countries and the Soviet Union, and what conditions he had for participating in a summit conference. Eisenhower replied that the basic purpose of talks like the one with Macmillan was to discuss steps to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. As for the necessary conditions for holding a summit meeting, these will be clarified in the U.S. and its allies’ response to the Soviet note of March 2.

Eisenhower stated that his views on the necessary conditions for holding a summit conference were well known, and he had not changed his opinion. He then answered a question about whether his earlier statement that a summit conference should depend on the development of the situation could be understood to mean that even if the foreign ministers' conference broke down, a meeting of heads of government would still be necessary. Eisenhower replied that he was referring to the foreign ministers' conference "making progress," and he said that he meant that a summit conference must depend on the foreign ministers' conference making progress.

A reporter asked Eisenhower to clarify "some conflicting reports" that the U.S. President had agreed "unconditionally" to participate in a summit conference. Eisenhower said he did not understand why anyone said he had unconditionally agreed to hold such a meeting. He said that no one who participated in his talks with Macmillan had said such a thing.

A reporter asked how he viewed the idea of holding government summit meetings more or less regularly, which, according to newspaper reports, was put forward by the British Prime Minister during the Camp David talks. Eisenhower replied that if a climate could be created in the future that would allow such meetings to achieve good results, then he would certainly not object to holding such meetings.

Eisenhower said he agreed that if Western countries hoped to reach a truly valuable agreement with the Soviet Union, then sooner or later he would have to deal with Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev personally. Eisenhower went on to say that this did not mean that Western countries could be "forced" to hold such a meeting, and he believed that government summit meetings should be held on the basis of consultation and the desire of the participants to reach a genuine agreement.

A reporter asked how he viewed the proposal to "freeze" armed forces and armaments levels in Europe. Eisenhower replied, implying that the issue was only discussed in general terms during the Camp David talks. He declined to state his attitude towards the proposal.

A reporter asked what impact the signing of a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic would have on the prospects for negotiations with the Soviet Union. Eisenhower replied that the fact itself did not affect the Western countries’ "rights" in Germany, and he did not think that this would affect the prospects for negotiations between Western countries and the Soviet Union.

    艾森豪威尔腔调依然未变
    继续坚持首脑会议要有先决条件
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿25日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔在25日举行的记者招待会上谈同苏联谈判的前景和他同英国首相麦克米伦会谈的结果。
    记者们问艾森豪威尔，他是否认为他同麦克米伦的会谈将导致缓和西方国家同苏联的关系，并且问，他在参加政府首脑会议的问题上有什么条件。艾森豪威尔回答说，类似同麦克米伦这样的会谈的基本目的是讨论缓和同苏联的紧张关系的步骤。至于谈到举行最高级会议的必需条件，这将在美国和它的盟国对苏联3月2日照会的复照中予以阐明。
    艾森豪威尔表示他对举行最高级会议所必需的条件的看法是大家都知道的，他并没有改变自己的观点。他接着回答了这样一个问题：早先他说过的关于最高级会议应当取决于事态的发展的话是否可以作这样的理解：即使外长会议破裂，政府首脑的会见也是必要的。艾森豪威尔回答说，他指的是外长会议“取得进展”，他说，他这句话的意思是说，最高级会议必须取决于外长会议取得进展。
    有记者请艾森豪威尔澄清“一些矛盾的消息”，这些消息说，美国总统“无条件地”同意参加政府首脑会议。艾森豪威尔说，他不明白为什么有人说他无条件地同意举行这种会议。他说，参加他同麦克米伦会谈的人谁也没有说过这样的话。
    有记者问，他如何对待或多或少经常地举行政府首脑会议的主张，据报纸报道，这个主张是英国首相在戴维营会谈过程中提出来的。艾森豪威尔回答说，如果将来能够创造一种气氛促使这种会议取得良好的结果，那么他当然不会反对举行这种会议。
    艾森豪威尔说，他同意这样一点：如果西方国家希望同苏联达成有真正价值的协议，那么迟早他要亲自同苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫打交道。艾森豪威尔接着说，这并不等于可以“强迫”西方国家举行这种会议，他认为政府首脑会议应该在协商和与会者希望达成真正协议的基础上举行。
    记者问，他如何对待在欧洲“冻结”武装部队和军备水平的主张。艾森豪威尔回答时暗示，在戴维营会谈的过程中只是泛泛谈到了这个问题。他拒绝表示他对这个主张的态度。
    记者问，苏联和德意志民主共和国之间签订和约对同苏联谈判的前景会产生什么影响。艾森豪威尔回答说，这个事实本身不涉及西方国家对德国的“权利”，而且他认为，这不会影响西方国家同苏联谈判的前景。
