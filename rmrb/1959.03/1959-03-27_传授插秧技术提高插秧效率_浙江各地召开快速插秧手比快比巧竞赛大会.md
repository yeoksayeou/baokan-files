Imparting Rice Transplanting Techniques to Improve Efficiency
Zhejiang Holds Quick Rice Transplanting Competitions

(Our dispatch from Hangzhou, March 26th) Quick rice transplanting competitions are being held across Zhejiang Province.

Most of the early rice seeds for continuous cropping in Zhejiang Province have already been sown. In areas where sowing was earlier, the robust seedlings are already three to four inches tall and will soon be ready for transplanting. To strive for a high-yield early rice harvest this year, most of the rice paddies in Zhejiang will adopt reasonable close planting with more than 40,000 to 50,000 clumps per mu. This requires a significant increase in transplanting speed and technique. To address this issue, in addition to vigorously promoting rice transplanters and improving labor organization, Zhejiang is holding quick rice transplanting competitions everywhere to summarize and promote quick transplanting techniques.

In the Jiaxing Special District, 137 rice transplanting experts participated in a quick transplanting competition in Wutong Commune, Tongxiang County. Xu Qiguan, a rice transplanting expert from Jiaxing County, won first place by transplanting 60,000 clumps per day. Xu Qiguan possesses highly skilled transplanting techniques and has made many innovations and improvements to the transplanting method. Combined with his concentration during transplanting, his hands move left and right like a shuttle, surpassing the swiftness of a dragonfly skimming the water. His transplanting posture is also meticulous: his legs form an arch, his chest is slightly forward, and his entire body gently undulates up and down with the movement of his hands, allowing his blood to circulate freely, preventing backaches and leg numbness even after one or two hours of continuous transplanting. His hand coordination is also excellent. As the right hand transplants to the right, the left hand follows, placing the seedlings in the middle of the third finger of the left hand. While the right hand is transplanting, the thumb of the left hand has already separated the seedlings, eliminating the need for the right hand to do so, greatly increasing transplanting speed. When he retreats, his feet do not lift out of the water, but move backward only with the heels, preventing the backward movement from affecting the transplanting action. Xu Qiguan's transplanting technique has left a deep impression on people, and many counties are preparing to promote his expertise and experience.

At the quick rice transplanting competitions held across various regions, fast female rice transplanters are receiving even more attention. The "Seven Fairies" of Huangyan, who were known throughout the province last year for their fast rice transplanting, initiated a friendly quick rice transplanting competition among women throughout the Wenzhou Special District. At this quick transplanting competition held in Huangyan County, with skilled participants from all counties in the special district, they maintained their top three positions. Xu Meixiang, the fastest transplanter, transplanted 1,295 clumps in ten minutes, averaging more than two clumps per second, and each clump was transplanted well with straight row spacing. This year, the "Seven Fairies" of Huangyan have made new innovations in transplanting techniques: they have learned the "flying clump" technique – separating the seedlings once to transplant two or three clumps consecutively, further increasing speed.

The "Seven Fairies" of Huangyan's proposal to launch a friendly quick rice transplanting competition has been enthusiastically responded to by women throughout Zhejiang Province, quickly igniting a massive "learn transplanting, practice martial arts" upsurge. In Huangyan County alone, more than 50,000 women have become rice transplanting experts, with some achieving transplanting speeds and quality comparable to the "Seven Fairies." Women in Linhai County responded to the "Seven Fairies'" quick rice transplanting competition proposal by launching a "Ten Thousand Fairies" movement, ambitiously aiming to compete with the "Seven Fairies" during the transplanting season. They are determined to "be production champions and skilled transplanting experts." More than 120 women cadres in the Luoyang Management District of Huangyan County's Luqiao Commune, upon hearing that the "Seven Fairies" had won the competition championship, immediately took off their shoes and socks, rolled up their trouser legs, and went into the fields to study transplanting techniques. After the women of Chengjiang Commune hired He Fengying, the eldest sister of the "Seven Fairies," to impart her transplanting experience, eight women were each able to transplant around 60,000 clumps of rice per day.

### 传授插秧技术提高插秧效率  浙江各地召开快速插秧手比快比巧竞赛大会

    传授插秧技术提高插秧效率
    浙江各地召开快速插秧手比快比巧竞赛大会
    本报杭州26日电　浙江各地分别召开快速插秧手现场比巧比快竞赛大会。
    浙江省连作早稻的种子大部分已经播下，在播种较早的地区，茁壮的秧苗已出土三四寸高，很快就要开始插秧。为了争取今年早稻获得高产，浙江大部分稻田都将采取每亩四、五万丛以上的合理密植，这就必须大大提高插秧速度和插秧技术。浙江各地为了解决这一问题，除了大力推广插秧机和改善劳动组织外，正到处召开快速插秧手现场比巧比快竞赛大会，总结和推广快速插秧的技术。
    嘉兴专区各县有一百三十七名插秧能手在桐乡县梧桐公社进行了快速插秧比赛，嘉兴县插秧能手徐其观以日插六万丛获得第一名。徐其观有高度娴熟的插秧技术，插秧方法又有很多创造和改进，加上插秧时思想集中，双手如穿梭般的左右来回，胜过蜻蜓点水。他的插秧姿势也很讲究，两脚成弓形，胸略挺，全身随手的动作上下轻微颠动，使全身血脉流通，即使连插一、二小时也不致腰酸脚麻。他的双手配合也极好。当右手插到右方时，左手跟向右方，秧苗放在左手第三指的中间，当右手插秧时，左手的大拇指已经把秧分好，无需右手分秧，这样就大大加快了插秧的速度。他后退时，脚不拔出水面，只用脚跟向后移动，不因后退而影响插秧动作。徐其观的插秧技术给人们很深的印象，很多县都准备推广他的特长和经验。
    在各地快速插秧手的现场比巧比快竞赛大会上，快速的妇女插秧手更受到人们的重视。去年以快速插秧闻名全省的黄岩“七仙女”，她们曾向温州专区全区的妇女发起快速插秧友谊竞赛的倡议。这次在黄岩县举行的有全专区各县好手参加的快速插秧比巧比快大会上，她们保持了前三名。插秧最快的许梅香十分钟插了一千二百九十五丛，平均每一秒钟插两丛多，而且每一丛秧都插得好，行距也笔直。今年黄岩“七仙女”在插秧技术上又有了新的创造：她们学会了“飞株”技术——一次分秧，可连插二、三丛，使速度更加提高。
    黄岩“七仙女”提出的展开快速插秧友谊竞赛的倡议，得到了浙江全省妇女的热烈响应，很快就掀起了一个规模巨大的“学插秧、练武艺”的热潮，仅黄岩县就有五万多妇女已成为插秧能手，有的插秧速度和质量还赶上了“七仙女”。临海县妇女响应“七仙女”快速插秧竞赛倡议，开展了“万名仙女”运动，她们雄心勃勃，要与“七仙女”在插秧季节大赛一场，他们决心“当生产健将，做插秧巧手”。黄岩县路桥公社螺洋管理区一百二十多个妇女干部听说“七仙女”得到了竞赛冠军，马上就有一百零五人脱鞋袜，卷裤管，下田钻研插秧技术。澄江公社的妇女在聘请了“七仙女”中的大姐贺凤英传授插秧经验后，有八个妇女每人每天已能插秧六万丛左右。（附图片）
