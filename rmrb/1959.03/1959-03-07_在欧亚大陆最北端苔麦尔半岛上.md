    On the Taimyr Peninsula, the Northernmost Part of Eurasia
    By Our Correspondent Li Nan
    Flying north from Igarka along the Yenisei River, the entire area is tundra. Like an outstretched palm, the Taimyr Peninsula juts into the heart of the Arctic Ocean, bordered by the Laptev Sea to the east and the Kara Sea to the west. The northernmost point, Cape Chelyuskin, faces the Severnaya Zemlya across a strait at 77 degrees 50 minutes north latitude, a strait congested with ice floes. The journey from Igarka to Cape Chelyuskin is over a thousand kilometers. The entire Taimyr Peninsula covers 820,000 square kilometers, larger than Germany, Italy, Austria, and Belgium combined.

    Although the entire Taimyr Peninsula is a tundra permafrost zone, the landscape changes continuously from south to north. Igarka is the boundary between the forest zone and the tundra zone. Here, the vast Siberian forests turn into shrubland interspersed with tundra. Looking down from the plane, these clumps of shrubs can still be clearly distinguished. Soon, the low shrubs disappear completely, entering the complete tundra world.

    Below is a snow-covered plain. The features of pools, lakes, and hills are indistinguishable. Occasionally, some solitary trees appear. When these scattered small trees have completely disappeared, we know that we are approaching the depths of the Taimyr Peninsula's tundra.

    The Taimyr Peninsula belongs to the Taimyr National District, the homeland where many northern minorities of the Soviet Union have lived for generations. The Taimyr Peninsula points directly to the Arctic region, making it an ideal base for Arctic workers to advance.

    In Dudinka, the Center of the National District
    After flying for an hour and a half, in the hazy sky, we saw the giant arms of cranes and the majestic figures of icebreakers from the plane. Dudinka, the center of the Taimyr National District, is in sight. We landed at the airport on the bank of the Yenisei River.

    Dudinka is also a city that has grown up in the era of Soviet power. On this sloping land on the right bank of the Yenisei River, a port and an airport have been opened, and factories and the northernmost railway line in the Soviet Union have been built. The residents of Dudinka are increasing year by year, and the construction area is constantly expanding. On the way to the city, we saw rows of residences and many tall and beautiful buildings. Judging from the scale of the streets and houses, Dudinka is not a small city in the context of the Arctic Circle.

    In addition to Russians, the residents of Dudinka include Nenets, Dolgans, Evenks, and Kets, all wearing beautiful ethnic costumes, coming and going in the streets. Along with the buses, there are dog sleds and reindeer sleds driven by collective farm members, which sometimes run faster than cars. Residents put their children on small sleds and pull them out for a walk. Groups of young people ski and speed on the open slopes in the city center.

    We visited the office building of the Executive Committee of the National District Soviet. Deputy Chairman Alekseyev gave us a general introduction to the situation in the national district. He said: "The national district has six administrative regions, in addition to Dudinka, there are industrial centers like Norilsk and seaports like Dickson. This northernmost part of Eurasia has a long coastline, undulating hills, vast rivers, and beautiful lakes." He tried to describe the richness and beauty of this peninsula as much as possible, as if to prevent newcomers from feeling that the area was desolate and barren because of names such as tundra, Arctic, and permafrost. He said: "Except for a very shallow layer of moss at the very northern tip of the peninsula, other plants are difficult to grow. Most of the tundra has strawberries and flowers. In summer, the land is like a thick felt, interspersed with countless flowers. Groups of wild deer roam the tundra, and migratory birds fly in the low sky." As a government worker in the national district, Alekseyev has worked for more than ten years and intends to continue working. I think his narrative is not only to make a good impression on guests, but because he is indeed familiar with and loves this area.

    In Dudinka, we visited the hospital, cultural palace, and museum. In the museum of the national district, the exhibits we saw showed that the Taimyr Peninsula is indeed a rich land. There are forty or fifty kinds of fish products here. The fur types that people love are also very rich. As for mineral deposits, there are iron, copper, aluminum, oil shale, and coal. The peninsula has rich coal reserves, and it is also said that the remains of ancient mammoths have been found on the peninsula, which shows that it used to be a very warm area. The peninsula's resources were later buried and covered by the outwardly harsh and barren phenomena. Only under the Soviet regime were they discovered and developed to serve the happiness of the various ethnic groups in northern Soviet Union.

      A Hub of Air Transportation
    The Taimyr National District is sparsely populated, and collective farms and settlements are far apart. In winter, ice and snow block the roads. In summer, the snow melts, forming many pools, hindering normal transportation. In order to adapt to the conditions in the north, northern ethnic groups have always used reindeer as a means of transportation. Even now, reindeer sleds are still used as before. However, aviation has been universally developed, extending to every settlement.

    The aviation industry has relieved many sufferings for the northern ethnic minorities and brought unspeakable conveniences to their lives. Local comrades told us that, under the living conditions in the Arctic, using airplanes is more economical and convenient than railways and highways. Building roads and railways is neither economical nor extremely difficult.

    Dudinka is the aviation center of the Taimyr National District, connecting various settlements. We specially talked with Comrade Zhernov, the head of the airport. He said that the Dudinka Airport officially opened in 1936 and has regular contact with every settlement in the district. The An-2 aircraft is light and flexible, and with skis, it can land in any snow-covered area.

    Returning to the airport from the city, we saw several planes taking off one after another, although it was a cold, misty night. The fuselage was completely wrapped in the snow swirling up from the engine, and disappeared completely in an instant. Perhaps it was going to a remote part of the tundra to pick up a patient from a northern ethnic group. We had often heard about the heroic labor achievements of pilots and medical staff in the northern ethnic minority areas, and now we saw this reality with our own eyes.

    The Victory of the Lenin's Nationalities Policy
    The Taimyr Peninsula is a region where various northern ethnic groups live, but the main one is the Dolgan people. Although there are only a few thousand Dolgans, they are the most numerous among the various ethnic minorities on the peninsula.

    Like the various northern ethnic groups, the history of the Dolgan people is also one full of bitterness and sorrow. Before the revolution, the Dolgan people were one of the northern minorities on the verge of extinction. Cruel exploitation and oppression, backward economy and culture, almost destroyed this small number of people within the Arctic Circle.

    The October Revolution averted the fate of the people of all ethnic groups on the Taimyr Peninsula from extinction, enabling the Dolgan people to leap directly from clan society to socialist society. After the revolution, the first measure taken by the Soviet regime on the Taimyr Peninsula was to organize clan Soviets and mobile Soviets in various ethnic groups to carry out political education and various reform work. From 1930 to 1938, it took eight years to complete the work of collectivization, organize the friendly and united farms of the northern ethnic groups, and develop the economic and cultural life of the various ethnic groups according to the special conditions in the north.

    There are now twenty-two collective farms on the peninsula. In 1953, these farms had a total income of seven million rubles, which increased to twenty-four million rubles in 1957. The average income per workday is twenty rubles, and the highest is thirty-five rubles.

    Dolgan farmers have learned animal husbandry and cultivation. The natural environment on the peninsula provides ample conditions for the development of diversified economies in farms. Each farm has organized specialized mobile hunting teams and fishing teams, who go to the tundra with reindeer-pulled huts and move at any time. Along with them are specialized cultural workers and medical staff. Their children stay in the boarding schools on the farm to study. The day the hunting team and fishing team set off is a joyous festival for the farm.

    On the tundra, the simple and backward conical deer skin tents of ancient times have gradually disappeared, and new villages with convenient facilities have appeared. In the new villages, schools, hospitals, nurseries, and clubs have been established, just like the villages in the interior.

    Before the revolution, the Turukhan region, including the Taimyr Peninsula, with more than one million square kilometers, had only two doctors. Now the national district has more than one hundred doctors and more than ten hospitals. Diseases caused by long-term living conditions have been reduced or completely eliminated. Swarms of mosquitoes are a major defect in the tundra in summer. In order to prevent diseases caused by mosquitoes, the government has recently allocated a large amount of funds and prepared special medicines.

    Today's Taimyr Peninsula is facing a situation of great development. During our visit, the Party Congress of the National District was being held to discuss the seven-year perspective plan. The national district has only tens of thousands of people, but they are all capable people who have been tempered by wind and snow. They are determined to quickly build communism on this vast land at the northernmost point of Eurasia.

    Comrade Mikhailov, the first secretary of the Party Committee of the National District, is a Dolgan and a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The head of the agricultural department of the national district is also a Dolgan comrade. When he saw us off at the airport and talked about the past and present of the Dolgan people, he said: "The past and present of the northern ethnic minorities are really like hell and heaven, incomparable!" From the road of death to the road of prosperity, this is the fate of the northern ethnic minorities, and this is the victory of Lenin's nationalities policy on the Taimyr Peninsula.

      In the Area Where Hunters Winter
    In winter, the hunters of the Taimyr Peninsula set off to the northernmost area to hunt the most precious Arctic fox. There are fifty-eight such hunters along the Arctic Ocean coast. We once visited an area where hunters spend the winter hunting.

    These fifty-odd hunters are distributed in the Dickson District, covering an area of more than 240,000 square kilometers. Each hunter operates within a certain range. We drove along the coast from Dickson for thirty kilometers in an off-road vehicle. In the open, snowy tundra, the driver used the starlight to discern the direction and slowly move forward. After driving for two and a half hours, we saw a gleam of cold light emerging from the snow. The hunter's cabin appeared in front of us like a lone island in the sea.

    The hunter, Sesoyev, has come here for the seventh time to spend the winter. He lives here with his wife, Kaga, and their two children study at a boarding school in Dickson. In the area of several hundred square kilometers assigned to him, he has installed two hundred and fifty wooden traps and three hundred and fifty iron moving rings. For the precious fur of the Arctic fox, he must constantly patrol the cold and uninhabited tundra on a sled. For the precious fur of the Arctic fox, the two of them must spend a long winter in the small wooden house.

    The animals in the Arctic region are all pure white. Polar bears, seals, walruses, and even Arctic mice are white. Sesoyev showed us the forty-odd Arctic foxes he had caught in the past two weeks, truly snow-white and soft fur. He estimated that he could catch at least two hundred and fifty during this hunting season.

    Before the revolution, the hunters in the Arctic region suffered from the heavy exploitation of fur merchants. The merchants used the fact that the hunters lived far in the depths of the tundra to exploit them. Now, these fifty-odd hunters are all organized in hunting stations. The wooden house where Sesoyev lives was built by the station, and all the production and living materials he uses are transported by the station on time. The station also purchases the furs at a unified price according to national regulations. The station's off-road vehicles often come to visit and also screen art films, although the audience is only him and his wife.

    Sesoyev invited us to see the closest wooden trap and explained to us how the hungry Arctic fox in the tundra in winter falls into the trap. The characteristic of the trap is that it can capture the Arctic fox without damaging the fur at all. Back in the house, we saw that the host's life was indeed prosperous. There are many newspapers and books in the house. The newspapers include "Pravda," "Krasnogorsky Worker," and "Polar Star." These newspapers and books are their good companions for spending the Arctic night. The host entertained guests with meat pies and dumplings made with venison. We raised our glasses to bless them. Everyone said that if they see beautiful Arctic fox fur somewhere in the future, they will definitely remember the hunters who work hard in the Arctic night on the Taimyr Peninsula.
  Cape Chelyuskin, the Northernmost Point of Eurasia
    Cape Chelyuskin is the northernmost point of the Taimyr Peninsula and also the northernmost point of Eurasia. It is a scientific village that began to be built in 1936. Chelyuskin is the name of an eighteenth-century Russian sailor who traveled throughout the Taimyr Peninsula and wrote the first book about the peninsula. In order to commemorate him, it was named here. This is called Chelyuskin. This is a wilderness of rocks and moss, and the climate is very cold. The farm scientific station is more than 400 kilometers south of here and is not small in scale, with more than one hundred staff members. The scientific station was organized by the famous Arctic explorer Babanin. There were few people at the beginning, but with the development of the Northern Sea Route and the progress of Arctic research, the scale of the station has expanded day by day. There are many buildings here, which already have the scale of a village.

    The strait composed of Cape Chelyuskin and Severnaya Zemlya is seventy kilometers wide and is the most difficult section of the Northern Sea Route. On the coast there is a sign made of stones indicating that this is the end of the continent. We stood on this high coast, the north was a black night, and on the sea under our feet we could vaguely see countless icebergs, like countless giant elephants, frozen and motionless. At this time, a plane happened to fly from afar and landed, and the scientific station and the airport were brightly lit. We looked around, although the north wind was fierce, and some people's nostrils had white spots, which was a sign that the skin was beginning to freeze. But we were reluctant to leave this northernmost land on the Eurasian continent. Cape Chelyuskin, this starting station for conquering the Arctic, is where many Arctic workers bid farewell to the continent and then return after working for a long time on the Arctic islands and ice floes, and are first warmly received here. We firmly believe that it will not take long for a noisy city to grow up here, just like many other regions in the Arctic.

### 在欧亚大陆最北端苔麦尔半岛上

    在欧亚大陆最北端苔麦尔半岛上
    本报记者　李楠
    从伊加尔卡起飞沿着叶尼塞河向北飞行，一路上都是苔原区域。像一只伸出的手掌一样，苔麦尔半岛一直突入到北极海洋的中心，东邻拉普切夫海，西抱喀拉海。最北的一点车留斯肯和北地岛遥遥相望，在北纬七十七度五十分的地方构成了一条浮冰拥塞的海峡。从伊加尔卡到车留斯肯航程一千多公里。整个苔麦尔半岛一共有八十二万平方公里，比德国、意大利、奥地利、比利时加在一起的面积还要大一些。
    虽然全部苔麦尔半岛都是苔原冻土地带，但地面的景物却也由南到北不断在变化。伊加尔卡是森林地带和苔原地带的交界线，西伯利亚的莽林在这里变成了和苔原交错的灌木林。从飞机上往下望，这些一丛丛的灌木林还可以清晰分辨出来。不久，低矮的灌木丛全部消失，进入了完全的苔原世界。
    下面是一片白雪掩盖的原野。池沼、湖泊、丘陵的面目已经无法辨认。偶尔还有一些孤独的树木出现。等到这些零落的小树已完全绝迹的时候，我们知道开始接近苔麦尔半岛苔原的深处了。
    苔麦尔半岛属于苔麦尔民族区，是苏联许多北方少数民族世世代代生长的家乡。苔麦尔半岛直接指向北极地区，是北极工作者们一块理想的前进基地。
    在民族区中心杜金卡
    飞行一个半钟头之后，在朦胧的天色中，从飞机上看见起重机的巨臂，破冰船的雄姿。苔麦尔民族区的中心杜金卡在望了。我们在叶尼塞河岸上的机场降落。
    杜金卡也是苏维埃政权时代成长起来的城市。在叶尼塞河右岸这块倾斜的土地上面，开辟了港口和航空站，建立了工厂和苏联最北的铁路线。杜金卡的居民一年年在增加，建筑面积也不断在增多。在到城市去的路上，我们看到一片片的住宅，看到许多高大漂亮的房屋。从街道和房屋的规模判断，就北极圈的情况来说，杜金卡已不算一个太小的城市。
    杜金卡的居民除了俄罗斯人外，还有涅涅茨人、多尔干人、爱文克人、凯特人，他们都穿着美丽的民族服装，在街道上来来往往。和公共汽车一起奔驰的有集体农庄庄员们驾驶的狗拉和鹿拉的雪橇，这些雪橇有时比汽车跑得还快。居民们把小孩放在小雪橇上拉着出来散步。一群群的青年人就在市中心空旷的斜坡上滑雪飞驰。
    我们到民族区苏维埃执行委员会的办公楼去访问。副主席阿列克塞也夫概括地给我们介绍了民族区的一般情况。他说：“民族区下面有六个行政区，除了杜金卡外，还有像诺林斯克这样的工业中心，有像迪克森这样的海港。这个欧亚大陆的最北端有绵长的海岸，有起伏的丘陵，有浩大的河流，也有美丽的湖泊。”他尽量地给我们叙述这个半岛的富饶和美丽，像是要让新来者不要因为苔原、北极、冻土等名称就产生对这个地区的荒寒贫瘠的感觉似的。他说：“只有半岛的顶北端除了一层非常浅薄的苔藓，其他植物很难生长而外，大部分苔原上都有草莓和花卉。夏天，大地上像是铺了一层丰厚的毛毡，间杂着无数的花朵。一群群的野鹿在苔原上奔走，候鸟在低空飞翔。”作为民族区的政府工作人员，阿列克塞也夫已经工作了十多年，并且还打算继续工作下去。我想，他的叙述到不光是为了使客人有良好的印象，而是自己确乎是熟悉这个地区，热爱这个地区。
    在杜金卡，我们参观了医院、文化宫和博物馆。在民族区的博物馆，我们看到的陈列品说明了苔麦尔半岛的确是块富饶的土地。这里的鱼产有四、五十种之多。那些令人爱不释手的皮毛种类也非常丰富。至于矿藏，这里有铁、铜、铝、油母页岩，还有煤。半岛上有丰富的煤藏，同时听说半岛上还发现过古代巨象的遗迹，这些都说明这里曾经是非常温暖的区域。半岛上的富源后来被外表上的酷寒荒凉现象所埋没、掩盖，只有到了苏维埃政权之下，才被人发现和开发出来，为苏联北方各族人民的幸福服务。
      航空交通的枢纽
    苔麦尔民族区地广人稀，集体农庄和居民点相隔遥远。冬天冰雪把道路封锁了起来，夏天雪化了，形成许多池沼，妨碍着正常的交通联系。为了适应北方的条件，北方民族自来就利用驯鹿作为交通工具。直到现在鹿拉的雪橇也还是照旧使用。但是航空普遍发展，伸展到每一个居民点。
    航空事业给北方各少数民族解除了许多苦难，带来了难以言尽的生活上的便利。当地同志告诉我们说，在北极的生活情况下，利用飞机比铁路和公路都要经济便利得多。修筑公路铁路既不经济，而且有极大的困难。
    杜金卡是苔麦尔民族区联系各个居民点的航空中心。我们特地和航空站站长热诺夫同志谈了话，他说，1936年杜金卡航空站正式开航，和区内的每个居民点都有定期联系。安二式飞机轻巧灵便，再加上滑雪板，因此可以在任何一个雪封的地区降落。
    从城市返回机场，我们看见好几架飞机都相继起飞，虽然这时正当寒雾漫天，夜色方浓。机身完全包裹在发动机扇起来的雪团中间，顷刻就完全消逝。也许又是到一个遥远的苔原深处去迎接一个北方民族的病人罢。平常我们就听过许多北方少数民族地区飞行员和医务人员的英勇劳动功绩，现在亲眼看到了这个真实的情况。
    列宁民族政策的胜利
    苔麦尔半岛是北方各民族杂居的地区，但是主要的是多尔干人。虽然多尔干人一共也不过几千，但在半岛上各少数民族中算是人数最多的了。
    像北方各个少数民族一样，多尔干民族的历史也是一篇充满了辛酸和悲痛的历史。在革命前，多尔干民族属于北方正在走向灭亡过程中的少数民族之一。残酷的剥削和压迫，落后的经济和文化，几乎毁灭了北极圈内这个人数不多的民族。
    十月革命避免了苔麦尔半岛上各族人民灭亡的命运，使多尔干民族从氏族社会直接飞跃到社会主义社会。革命后，苏维埃政权在苔麦尔半岛上的第一个措施是在各个民族中组织了氏族苏维埃和流动苏维埃，进行政治教育和各项改革工作。从1930年到1938年，用八年的时间完成了集体化的工作，组织了北方各民族友爱团结的农庄，根据北方的特殊条件，发展各民族的经济和文化生活。
    现在半岛上有二十二个集体农庄。1953年，这些农庄共收入七百万卢布，1957年已增加到二千四百万卢布。平均每个劳动日收入是二十卢布，最高的到三十五卢布。
    多尔干农民学会了畜牧和种植。半岛上的自然环境给农庄发展多种经济准备了充分的条件。各个农庄都组织了专门的流动打猎队和捕鱼队，他们带着鹿拉的小屋到苔原上去，随时移动。随着他们一道流动的有专门的文化工作人员和医务工作人员。他们的子女留在农庄的寄宿学校里读书。打猎队和捕鱼队出发的日子是农庄的一个欢乐的节日。
    在苔原上已逐渐消灭了亘古以来的简陋落后的圆锥形的鹿皮帐篷，出现了一个个的有便利设备的新村。在新村里，建立了学校、医院、托儿所、俱乐部，一如内地的村落。
    革命前包括苔麦尔半岛在内的一百多万方公里的土鲁汗边区，只有两名医生，现在民族区有一百多名医生，十多家医院。由于长期生活条件造成的疾病已经减少或完全消灭。蚊虫成群是夏天苔原上的一大缺陷，为了防治蚊虫带来的疾病，政府最近拨了大批款项，准备了专门的药品。
    今天的苔麦尔半岛面临着大发展的局面。在我们访问的时候，民族区正在召开党的代表会议，讨论七年远景计划。民族区一共只有几万人口，可是他们都是经过风雪锻炼的能干的人，他们决心在这块亚欧大陆最北的辽阔土地上迅速建设共产主义。
    民族区党委会第一书记米哈依洛夫同志是多尔干人，是苏联最高苏维埃的代表。民族区的农业科长也是一位多尔干同志，他送我们到机场，谈起多尔干人的今昔时说：“北方少数民族过去和现在，真像地狱和天堂一样，不能比拟啊！”从死亡的道路到繁荣的道路，这就是北方少数民族的命运，这就是列宁民族政策在苔麦尔半岛的胜利。
      在猎人过冬的地区
    苔麦尔半岛的猎人们在冬天就出发到最北的地区去捕猎最珍贵的北极狐。在北冰洋沿岸上，有五十八个这样的猎人。我们曾经访问了一个猎人过冬打猎的地区。
    这五十多个猎人分布在面积为二十四万多方公里的迪克森区。每个猎人在一定的范围内活动。我们坐着越野车从迪克森沿着海岸走了三十公里。在空旷的积雪的苔原上，司机借着星光辨别方向，缓缓前进。走了两个半钟头，看到从雪地上冒出来一缕寒光，打猎人的小木屋像大海中的孤岛似地出现在我们的前面。
    打猎人色索也夫已经是第七次来到这里过冬了。他和妻子卡加一道住在这里，两个儿女在迪克森寄宿学校读书。在划分给他的方圆几百公里的地段上，他安装了二百五十个木制的捕机，三百五十个铁制的活动环圈。为了珍贵的北极狐的皮毛，他要不断地坐着雪橇在寒冻无人的苔原上巡回。为了珍贵的北极狐的皮毛，他们俩个人要在小木屋里度过一个漫长的冬季。
    在北极地区的动物都是纯白的颜色。白熊、海豹、海象连北极鼠都是白色。色索也夫把两个星期来捕得的四十多只北极狐给我们看，真是雪白柔软的皮毛。他估计在今年狩猎季节至少可以捕上二百五十只。
    在革命前，北极地区的猎人受着皮毛商人的重重剥削。商人们利用猎人远居苔原深处的情况，进行盘剥。现在，这五十多个猎人都组织在狩猎站里。色索也夫住的木屋是站里修建的，使用的一切生产和生活物资都由站里按时运来，皮毛也由站里按国家规定价格统一收购。站里的越野车经常来访问，还来放映艺术影片，虽然观众只有他们夫妻俩人。
    色索也夫邀请我们去看了看设在最近的木制捕机，给我们讲解冬天在苔原上饥饿的北极狐如何落入捕机里面。捕机的特点是既要把北极狐捕获，同时又不损害皮毛分毫。回到屋子里面，我们看到主人的生活确是丰裕的。屋中报纸书籍不少。报纸中有“真理报”、“克拉斯诺戈尔斯克工人报”、“北极星”三种。这些报纸和书籍是他们两人度过北极长夜的良伴。主人用鹿肉做的肉饼和饺子招待客人。我们举杯祝福他们。大家说，今后如果在甚么地方看到美丽的北极狐的皮毛，一定会记起苔麦尔半岛的在北极夜里辛勤劳动的打猎人。
  欧亚大陆最北点车留斯肯
    车留斯肯是苔麦尔半岛最北端，也是欧亚大陆的最北点，这是一个1936年开始建设起来的科学村。车留斯肯是十八世纪俄国一个水手的名字，他曾经走遍了苔麦尔半岛，写下了有关半岛的第一部著作。为了纪念他，这里取名。这里的叫车留斯肯。这里是一片岩石和青苔的原野，气候非常冷酷。这里往南四百多公里才有农庄科学站规模不小，有一百多个工作人员。科学站是有名的北极探险家巴巴宁组织的，才开始时人很少，随着北海航运的发展和研究北极工作的进展，站的规模一天天扩大了。这里的建筑不少，已经具备一个村镇的规模。
    车留斯肯和北地岛组成的海峡宽七十公里，是北海航线中最困难的一段。在海岸上有一块用石块砌的标志，指明这里是大陆的终点。我们站在这高高的海岸上，北方是一片黑夜，脚下的海面上可以隐约看到无数的冰山，像无数巨象一样，凝伏不动。此时恰好有飞机从远处飞来降落，科学站和机场上灯火灿烂。我们环顾四周，虽然朔风凛冽，有的人鼻孔已出现了白点，这是皮肤开始冻坏的标志。但这块欧亚大陆最北端的土地却使我们依依不舍。车留斯肯，这个征服北极的出发站，多少北极工作者在这里告别大陆，然后从北极的岛屿和浮冰上长期工作归来，又首先在这里受到亲切的接待。我们深信，不会需要很久时间，这里也会像北极其他许多地区一样，喧闹的城市将在这里成长起来。
