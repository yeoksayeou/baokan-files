This newspaper reports: Reporter Ji Jingru reports: Harbin No. 19 Middle School has adopted various specific measures this semester to incorporate productive labor into the teaching plan; at the same time, in accordance with the spirit of full-time schools focusing on learning, it has rationally arranged time for teaching, productive labor, and recreational activities.

In last year's work-study program, No. 19 Middle School ran many small factories. These factories have now been reorganized. Most of the factories that are closely integrated with teaching have been enriched with equipment and adjusted production to make them more in line with the teaching process. In addition, several factories that meet teaching requirements have been added, and some factories that are less related to teaching have been reduced. The existing factories can be roughly divided into two categories: one category is basically used as a practice factory for this semester's "productive labor class," so that young people can engage in some useful labor suitable for their age characteristics while learning, learn the use of basic production tools, and lay a good foundation for participating in productive labor in the future; the other category is closely integrated with the teaching content of physics, chemistry, handicraft and other courses, such as distillation water plants, acetone plants, starch plants, alkali plants, ampoule plants, tile plants, marble plants, embroidery sewing and linen textile plants, etc., which basically become expanded laboratories for these courses. In this way, students can understand and master more firmly the three states of matter change, purification, industrial production of distilled water, the production methods and principles of organic chemistry's acetone and ethanol, etc., which are explained in physics and chemistry classes, through on-site operation.

At the same time, in order to supplement the shortcomings of course textbooks, the small factories of Harbin No. 19 Middle School have compiled their own teaching materials this semester in combination with teaching and production. The content includes the application of knowledge principles taught in class, production methods, operating procedures, compliance with discipline, attention to safety, and conscious cultivation of students' excellent qualities of the working class, so that students can regard participation in productive labor as an important link organically related to teaching from the content.

The productive labor time in these factories is all included in the curriculum. The school stipulates that each class participates twice a week, and each time does not exceed three hours. All teachers in the school also work with students of fixed classes according to the grade they teach, the courses they teach, or their personal expertise, fully responsible for lecturing, managing, inspecting and supervising the productive labor of this class. Teachers and students all have labor manuals, and labor performance is assessed regularly.

Harbin No. 19 Middle School has also scientifically arranged the time for teaching, production, recreational activities, and political and ideological education, making full use of each classroom and factory, with classes and production in each session, turning this two-shift school with twenty-six classes and more than 1,200 students into a one-shift school. In this way, each class spends twenty-eight to thirty sessions a week in the classroom and six sessions in the factory. There are forty-five minutes of free time every day for recreational activities and team activities. These teaching, production, recreational activities and team activities are all arranged within the time from 7:30 am to 3:00 pm every day. In addition to teaching and participating in labor, teachers also have sufficient time for lesson preparation, tutoring, and teaching research activities during this time. After 5:00 pm, they can engage in personal advanced studies or rest. (Attached picture)

    把生产劳动纳入教学计划
    哈尔滨十九中改进教学和劳动生产工作
    本报讯　记者纪静如报道：哈尔滨十九中学，这学期采取了多种具体措施，把生产劳动纳入教学计划；同时，根据全日制学校以学习为主的精神，合理安排了教学、生产劳动和文体活动时间。
    十九中学在去年勤工俭学活动中，曾经办了很多小工厂。现在把这些工厂重新排队作了整顿。对于大部分能密切结合教学的工厂，充实设备、调整生产，使之与教学环节更加合拍；另外增加了几个符合教学要求的工厂，减少了一些与教学关系不大的工厂。现有工厂大致可分为两类：一类基本上作为本学期“生产劳动课”的实习工厂，使青少年在学习的同时，进行一些适合年龄特点的有益劳动，学会基本生产工具的使用，为将来参加生产劳动打下良好基础；另一类是与物理、化学、手工艺等课程的教学内容紧密结合的蒸馏水厂、丙酮厂、淀粉厂、制碱厂、安瓶厂、制瓦厂、大理石厂、刺绣缝纫及亚麻纺织厂等，基本上成为这些课程的扩大实验室。这样，学生在理化课上讲的物体三态变化、提纯、工业制蒸馏水、有机化学的丙酮、乙醇制法和原理等，通过实地操作就理解得更深刻，掌握得更牢固。
    同时，为了补充课程教本的不足，哈尔滨十九中学的各个小工厂，这学期都结合教学与生产自编了教材。内容包括课堂讲授过的知识原理的应用、生产方法、操作规程，遵守纪律，注意安全，有意识的培养学生具备工人阶级的优良品质等，使学生从内容上把参加生产劳动看成是与教学有机联系的一个重要环节。
    在这些工厂的生产劳动时间，全部列入课程表。学校规定每个班级级生每周参加两次，每次不超过三小时。全校老师也按任课年级、讲授课程或个人擅长，固定与一定班级的学生，一起跟班劳动，全面负责对这个班级生产劳动的讲课、管理、检查督促。师生都有劳动手册，定期考查劳动成绩。
    哈尔滨十九中学还科学地安排了教学、生产、文体活动及政治思想教育的时间，充分利用每个教室和工厂，每节都有班级上课和生产，把这个有二十六个班、级一千二百多名学生的两部制学校变成了一部制。这样，每个班级每周在教室上课二十八到三十节，在工厂劳动六节。每天有四十五分钟自由活动时间，作为文体活动和团队活动。这些教学、生产、文体、团队活动都安排在每天上午七点半到下午三点的时间之内。老师在这个时间内除上课和参加劳动外，也有充分的时间进行备课、辅导和教学研究活动，下午五点以后就可以个人进修或休息。（附图片）
