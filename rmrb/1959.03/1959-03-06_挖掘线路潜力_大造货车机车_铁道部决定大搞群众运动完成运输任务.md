Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. Based on this year’s production plan targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton in our country, and the needs of various sectors of the national economy for an even greater leap forward, the growth rate of national railway freight volume in 1959 will exceed any year in our country’s history. The Ministry of Railways recently pointed out in its deployment of this year’s work that this task is very arduous. To ensure the completion of this task, it is necessary to further strengthen transportation organization, tap the potential of existing equipment; strengthen the weak links in railway transportation work, especially to vigorously increase the production of freight cars and locomotives; strengthen and transform existing railways, speed up the construction of double tracks and hubs on major trunk lines; and build railway branch lines and necessary trunk lines in industrial and mining areas.

Last year, the "native hump" shunting created by the workers of Fengtai Station, and the "high platform, low cargo position" loading and unloading created by the railway workers of Tangshan, increased the shunting efficiency and loading and unloading efficiency by tens to several times. The experiences of "marshal leading logistics," carrying goods along the way, and carrying goods on the way created by railway workers in Xi'an, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and other places have more effectively utilized the vehicle load. This year, these experiences will be promoted nationwide. At the same time, the railway department is currently mobilizing the masses to make a big technical revolution and carry out the "One-Five-One" movement in railway transportation (that is, requiring each railway bureau to have an average freight car turnaround time of one hour, loading and unloading operation time of five hours, turnaround time of one day, one million tons (each locomotive produces one million ton-kilometers per day), safety, punctuality, and a car donation movement), to further accelerate vehicle turnover and load and transport more quickly.

The vast majority of the increased freight volume this year will be completed by newly added vehicles. Therefore, increasing the production of a large number of locomotives and vehicles, especially freight cars, has become the key to realizing this year's freight plan. The Ministry of Railways has taken measures to strengthen the weak production links such as casting, forging, and machining in existing locomotive and vehicle factories to improve the manufacturing capacity of locomotives and vehicles. In the first half of this year, it will also seize the opportunity to carry out necessary expansions of these factories and build several new locomotive and vehicle factories.

Because the current railway transportation volume is mainly concentrated on the existing trunk lines, and there are very few double tracks on the existing railways in the country, and the capacity of railway transportation hubs is also weak, actively strengthening the existing railway trunk lines and transforming the existing lines and stations with insufficient transportation capacity is the primary task in this year's railway construction. The Ministry of Railways has determined that the focus of building double tracks and transforming existing railways this year is the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which connect the north and south of the motherland, as well as the lines where coal, ore, and timber transportation volumes are concentrated in the Northeast and North China regions.

Of the increased freight volume this year, the transportation of equipment and materials required for the construction of new steel bases, coal bases, and new projects in other industrial sectors, as well as the transportation of products and raw materials from these enterprises, accounts for a considerable proportion. To meet the needs of these regions and enterprises, the focus of new railway construction projects this year is to build a number of industrial and mining branch lines in more than a dozen provinces and regions.

The Ministry of Railways believes that the most fundamental way to complete the 1959 railway transportation task is to further carry out the mass movement of the whole party and the whole people running railways and continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs." In 1958, whether in loading and unloading work or double-track construction, the mass movement of the whole party and the whole people running railways showed extremely great power. The Ministry of Railways has decided to continue to promote and develop the rich experience gained in this regard this year.

    铁道部决定大搞群众运动完成运输任务
    据新华社5日讯　根据今年我国钢、煤、粮、棉的生产计划指标和国民经济各部门更大跃进的需要，1959年全国铁路货运量增长的比率，将超过我国历史上的任何一年。铁道部最近在部署今年的工作时指出，这一任务是很繁重的，保证完成这一任务，必须进一步加强运输组织工作，挖掘现有设备的潜力；加强铁路运输工作中的薄弱环节，特别是要大力增造货车、机车；加强和改造现有铁路，加紧修建主要干线的复线和枢纽；修建工矿区铁路支线和必要的干线。
    去年，丰台车站职工创造的“土驼峰”调车，唐山铁路职工创造的“高站台、低货位”装卸，曾经把调车效率、装卸效率提高了百分之几十到几倍。西安、上海、郑州等地铁路职工创造的“元帅带后勤”、捎脚和顺路带货等等经验，更加有效地利用了车辆载重。今年这些经验将在全国范围内推广。同时，铁路部门目前还正在发动群众，大闹技术革命，开展铁路运输上的“一——五——一（即要求各铁路局货车平均中转时间为一小时，装卸作业时间为五小时，周转时间为一天、百万吨（每台机车日产百万吨公里）、安全、正点、献车运动”，进一步加快车辆周转，多装快运。
    今年增加的货运量，绝大部分要靠新增车辆完成，因此，增造大批机车、车辆，特别是货车，就成为实现今年货运计划的关键。铁道部已经采取措施加强现有机车车辆工厂的铸工、锻工和机械加工等生产薄弱环节，提高机车、车辆的制造能力，今年上半年还将抓紧时机对这些工厂进行必要的扩建，并且新建几个机车车辆工厂。
    因为目前铁路运输量主要集中在现有的各个干线上，而全国现有铁路的复线很少，铁路运输枢纽的能力也弱，因此积极加强现有的铁路干线，改造现有运输能力不足的线路和车站，是今年铁路建设中的首要工作。铁道部确定，今年修建复线和改造现有铁路的重点，是联系祖国南北的京广铁路和京沪铁路，以及东北和华北区煤炭、矿石、木材运量集中的线路。
    在今年增加的货运量中，新建钢铁基地、煤炭基地和其他工业部门新建项目所需的器材物资以及这些企业产品、原料的运输，占相当比重。适应这些地区和企业的需要，今年新建铁路工程的重点是在十几个省、区内修筑若干工矿支线。
    铁道部认为，完成1959年铁路运输任务，最根本的途径是进一步开展全党全民办铁路的群众运动，继续贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针。1958年无论在装卸工作或复线建设方面，全党全民办铁路的群众运动，都显示了极其伟大的力量。铁道部决定在今年继续推广和发扬在这方面已经取得的丰富经验。
