Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The State Council issued a notice on March 8 regarding the work of catching prawns, yellow croaker, and other aquatic products, requiring Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other places to immediately deploy fishing operations in various fish and shrimp producing areas, and strive to over fulfill this year's production targets.

The notice said that the peak season for the production of yellow croaker and prawns is approaching. According to reports from individual regions, due to the warmer climate this year, the fishing season has arrived earlier, and it is estimated that the output will be greater than last year. In order to strengthen the supply of non-staple food and support export needs, it is hoped that all localities will immediately deploy fishing operations in various fish and shrimp producing areas, not only to complete the production targets issued by the Ministry of Aquatic Products, but also to strive to exceed them.

The notice requires all localities to earnestly prepare for all aspects of prawn, yellow croaker and other aquatic product catching, refrigeration equipment, and transportation, and to vigorously mobilize the masses to strive to complete and over fulfill this year's production targets.
