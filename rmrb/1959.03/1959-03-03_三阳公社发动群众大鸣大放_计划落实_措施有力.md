The Sanyang Commune Mobilizes the Masses for a Great Airing of Views
Plans Implemented, Measures Effective

(Our newspaper, Changsha, 2nd dispatch) The Sanyang People's Commune in Pingjiang County, Hunan, after fully mobilizing the masses for a great airing of views and a great debate in formulating its production plan, unanimously decided to increase this year's grain production to 2,500 jin per mu on the basis of last year's average yield of 1,005 jin per mu. The total income from agricultural and sideline industries (excluding industry) should reach 19,588,000 yuan, an increase of two times compared to last year. Now, the entire commune has high confidence and is working hard to ensure the realization of this even greater leap forward plan.

When the discussion of this year's production plan began, the commune's Party committee decided to launch a great airing of views and a great debate among the masses around the targets and measures of the production plan, so that the masses could recognize the favorable conditions for a greater leap forward, see the difficulties, and at the same time find ways to overcome the difficulties, so that the plan could take root in the minds of every commune member.

In the debate, commune members presented the favorable conditions for achieving this year's greater leap forward: for example, the realization of communization, eating without paying, so the masses no longer worry about the problem of eating, and can concentrate on production; funds can be used and labor can be deployed in a unified manner on a larger scale; there is the rich experience of last year's Great Leap Forward; and this year's preparatory work and material foundation are also much stronger than last year. In terms of production funds alone, there was very little cash at this time last year, but this year the commune has 720,000 yuan in cash.

While debating the favorable conditions for this year's production leap forward, the commune's Party committee also organized commune members to debate several issues of particular concern to them. The first question was: Is there a way to solve the labor shortage this year? They calculated three accounts: First, only about 12,000 people were engaged in agriculture last year. This year, a large number of women have been liberated. Even if some people are transferred to industry, the number of people engaged in agriculture will still reach more than 16,000, which is 800,000 more labor days than last year. Second, some people had to spend a few days a month at home working on their private plots and chopping firewood last year. This year, people participating in labor are unencumbered and can go to work every day, which is estimated to be 720,000 more labor days than last year. Third, a vigorous campaign of tool reform can save 1.97 million labor days. According to this calculation, the problem of labor shortage can be solved. The second question was: Can this year's output be doubled again? In the debate, everyone analyzed last year's various production increase measures, mainly focusing on water, density, and fertilizer. However, the density aspect was not well grasped in some places; the quantity of fertilizer was grasped, but the quality was ignored, especially the rational application of fertilizer was not paid enough attention to; and lodging occurred widely in early rice. Last year, deep plowing was hardly grasped. With last year's experience, the "Eight-Character Charter" can be implemented better and more comprehensively this year.

On the basis of unified ideological understanding, and through mass discussion, this year's production increase measures were formulated, which are: First, deep plowing of the land. Universally deep plow to more than eight inches, which is deeper than the four inches or so last year; all paddy fields should be thoroughly plowed three times and harrowed five times; for the 2,800 mu of land that is not easy to deep plow, the method of thickening the soil should be adopted, and a layer of soil should be added to ensure more than eight inches of muddy feet. Second, ensure water use. The 1,250 water conservancy projects that have been renovated can guarantee drought resistance for 60 days; and a water management system has been established to adjust the water system. Third, apply 1,000 dan of high-quality fertilizer per mu, and apply sufficient base fertilizer before transplanting. After transplanting, apply 100 jin of soil-chemical fertilizer per mu as top dressing, and pay attention to rational fertilization. Fourth, dense planting. 50,000 tufts per mu, 500,000 indica rice, even if one indica rice only produces 60 grains of plump rice, each season can guarantee a yield of 1,500 jin per mu. Fifth, widely use improved varieties. Early rice generally promotes improved varieties such as Nantet No. and Liuyang Early, and late rice is all late japonica. Sixth, do a good job in tool reform, saving 1.97 million labor days from this aspect. Seventh, prevent and control pests. Emphasize pest control in rice seedling beds once. The second harrowing and before heading is the season for pest occurrence, and control it continuously twice. Make 80,000 jin of homemade soil pesticides, and there are already 42,000 jin. Eighth, do a good job in field management. Implement planned "three to the field": First, determine what crops and seeds to plant in each field according to natural conditions. Second, output to the field, stipulating the annual output and the output of each season for each field. Third, measures to the field, specifically stipulating the number of plowing and harrowing times, the degree of deep plowing, the number of dense planting tufts, the amount of top dressing, and the number of harrowing times for each field.

After detailed debate on the production plan, the commune members saw the favorable conditions, found ways to overcome the difficulties, and became more confident and energetic. Work efficiency has generally improved. Originally, each person accumulated an average of 32 dan of fertilizer per day, but later it increased to 49 dan. Ling Dousheng, the captain of the fifth production team of the Jiashan Brigade, originally said that he could not produce 2,000 jin no matter what, but now he says: "The accounts are not clear, and the words are not clear. After everyone debates, their minds are opened, and I will take on the burden of 2,500 jin." Now the production of this commune is in full swing, and red flag competitions have been launched between the major brigades. Each mu already has more than 430 dan of fertilizer, more than 4,800 mu of rice seedling beds have been prepared, and spring harvested crops are undergoing the third processing and top dressing.

### 三阳公社发动群众大鸣大放  计划落实　措施有力

    三阳公社发动群众大鸣大放
    计划落实　措施有力
    本报长沙2日电　湖南平江县三阳人民公社在制订生产计划中，充分发动群众大鸣大放大辩论以后，一致决定今年的粮食在去年平均亩产一千零五斤的基础上，增加到二千五百斤，农副业（不包括工业）总收入要达到一千九百五十八万八千元，比去年增加两倍。现在，全社人人信心很高，正大干特干，保证实现这个更大跃进的计划。
    开始讨论今年生产计划的时候，公社党委便决定围绕生产计划的指标和措施，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，使群众认识到更大跃进的有利条件，看到困难，同时找到克服困难的办法，让计划在每个社员思想上落脚生根。
    在辩论中社员们摆出了实现今年更大跃进的有利条件：例如实现了公社化，吃饭不要钱，群众再不耽心吃饭的问题了，能专心搞生产；可以在更大的范围内统一使用资金，调配劳动力；有了去年大跃进的丰富经验；今年的备耕工作和物质基础也比去年雄厚很多。单是生产资金一项，去年此时很少有现金，而今年公社却存有现金七十二万元。
    在辩论今年生产跃进有利条件的同时，公社党委还就社员特别关心的几个问题组织社员进行了辩论。第一个问题是：今年劳动力紧张有没有办法解决？他们算了三笔账：第一、去年搞农业的只有一万二千人左右。今年大批妇女解放出来，即使抽调一部分人搞工业，搞农业的还是达到一万六千多人，比去年可以多作八十万个劳动日。第二、去年有一些人每月要在家里搞几天自留地和砍柴等。今年参加劳动的人都无牵无挂，可以天天出工，估计要比去年多做七十二万个劳动日。第三、大闹工具改革，共可节省劳力一百九十七万个。这样算来，劳力紧张的问题可以解决。第二个问题是：今年产量能不能再加番？在辩论中，大家分析了去年的各项增产措施，主要是抓了水、密、肥这几条。而密这一条有的地方就抓得不好；肥料抓了数量却又忽视了质量，特别是合理施肥注意得不够；早稻普遍发生了倒伏现象。去年对深耕几乎没有抓。今年有了去年的经验，就可以把“八字宪法”执行得更好更全面。
    在统一思想认识的基础上，又通过群众讨论，订出了今年的增产措施，这就是：第一、深翻土地。普遍深翻到八寸以上，比去年耕深四寸左右；全部水田做好三犁五耙；对二千八百亩不好深耕的土地，采取加厚土壤的办法，普遍加一层土，保证有八寸以上的泥脚。第二、保证用水，已整修了的一千二百五十处水利工程，能保证抗旱六十天；并建立起管水制度，调整好水系。第三、肥料每亩田施一千担优质肥料，在插秧以前施足底肥。插秧以后，每亩追施一百斤土化肥，并且注意合理施肥。第四、密植。每亩五万来兜，五十来万籼，即使一籼只结壮谷六十粒，每一季也可保证亩产一千五百斤。第五、广用良种。早稻普遍推广南特号、浏阳早等良种，晚稻全部用晚粳。第六、搞好工具改革，从这方面节省出劳动日一百九十七万个。第七、防治虫害。强调秧田治虫一次，第二次中耕和打苞以前是虫害发生季节，连续治两次。自制土农药八万斤，现已有四万二千斤。第八、作好田间管理。实行计划“三到田”，一、根据自然条件，确定每丘田种植什么作物种子。二、产量到丘，规定每丘田的全年产量和每一季的产量。三、措施到丘，具体规定每丘的犁耙次数、深耕程度、密植兜数、追肥数量、中耕次数。
    经过详细辩论生产计划以后，社员们看到了有利条件，找到了克服困难的办法，信心更高了，干劲更大了，工效普遍提高。原来每天每人平均积肥三十二担，后来提高到四十九担。甲山大队第五生产队队长凌豆生，原来说无论如何不能产两千斤，现在他说：“账不算不清，话不说不明，大家一辩论，心里通了窍，二千五百斤的担子我担承。”现在这个社的生产搞得热火朝天，各大队之间开展了红旗竞赛。每亩已有肥料四百三十多担，四千八百多亩秧田已经整理好了，春收作物正在进行第三次加工追肥。
