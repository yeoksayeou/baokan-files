Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 18th: The leadership meeting of the Japanese Socialist Party held today formally expressed its agreement with the joint statement issued on the 17th by Asanuma Inejirō, head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, and Zhang Xiruo, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The Socialist Party believes that this joint statement is in line with the party's policy.

At the leadership meeting, the Socialist Party also decided to mobilize public opinion demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and to actively promote a national movement demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its foreign policy. The meeting also decided that the Socialist Party would actively campaign in the upcoming local and Upper House elections to demand that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet change its foreign policy.

Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Suzuki Mosaburo, issued a statement today welcoming the joint statement. He said: "It is truly gratifying that the Chinese side and the Socialist Party delegation have reached a complete consensus on issues of common concern to Japan and China, such as establishing a non-nuclear zone in Asia and the Pacific region and establishing an Asian collective security system with Japan, China, the United States, and the Soviet Union as its main members."

Suzuki pointed out that the joint statement shows that under the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of following the United States and being hostile to China, it is impossible to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and to restore trade between Japan and China. Suzuki also pointed out that although the Kishi Nobusuke government pretends to be working hard to restore trade between Japan and China when elections are approaching, it will not succeed as long as it does not change its policy of hostility towards China. Suzuki stated that the Socialist Party will fight on the basis of the results of this delegation's visit to China, further intensify the national movement to crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and strive to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet in order to respond to the expectations of all Japanese people who eagerly hope to achieve peaceful independence, restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and restore trade between Japan and China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 18th: The Japanese Communist Party and various organizations enthusiastically support the joint statement issued on the 17th by Asanuma Inejirō, head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, and Zhang Xiruo, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, Miyamoto Kenji, stated that the Japanese Communist Party fully agrees with the spirit of the joint statement and is willing to work on this basis to further strengthen joint actions with the Socialist Party and other mass organizations. He also expressed the hope that the Socialist Party would unite on the path indicated in the joint statement, strengthen its connection with the people, adopt an attitude of never compromising with the enemy, and cooperate to launch joint actions.

Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Kazami Akira, expressed heartfelt support for the joint statement. He said that the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations will henceforth devote all its efforts to enabling a broad range of people to deepen their understanding of the spirit of the joint statement and to strive for the realization of the goals pointed to by the joint statement.

Kazami Akira said that all those who demand to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations should support this statement, and only the lackeys of U.S. imperialism oppose this statement. He also pointed out that this statement is bound to have an impact within the conservative parties.

Miyamoto Kenji and Kazami Akira also unanimously pointed out in their speeches that from now on, the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations and other Japanese democratic forces can hold high the clear banner - U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China, march in unison, and launch a joint struggle to crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty", restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and strive for the neutralization of Japan.

They also pointed out that the joint statement will play a beneficial role in this struggle and will move it forward.

Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Iwai Akira, stated that Sohyo fully supports the joint statement.

He pointed out that the joint statement specifies that crushing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system is the current urgent task of the people of Japan and China. Iwai stated that in order to achieve this goal, the workers belonging to Sohyo will further strengthen their struggle.

Regarding promoting friendly exchanges between the people of Japan and China, Iwai said that they will strive to create conditions for representatives from the Chinese side to visit Japan.

According to today's "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the reaction of the Japanese business community to the joint statement is that Japan-China trade cannot be restored unless the Kishi Nobusuke government changes its policy towards China and negotiates with China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 18th: The fourteen initiating organizations of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision and Strive for the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" issued an appeal on the evening of the 17th, calling on all Japanese groups and individuals to participate in the "National Conference to Prevent Revision and Strive for the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" scheduled to be established on March 28th. These initiating organizations include the Japanese Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

The appeal stated that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" not only restricts Japan's independence and establishes many U.S. military bases in Japan, but the revised "Security Treaty" will further strengthen the "Security Treaty" system, expand Japan's military, implement Japan's nuclear armament, and form an alliance between Japan and Taiwan and South Korea, becoming a base for attacking Asian countries. The appeal emphasized that this is a serious crisis for the Japanese people.

The appeal calls on all Japanese people to fight against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to abolish this treaty.

The appeal stated that in order to ensure Japan's true security, it is necessary to not participate in any military bloc, to implement an independent and active neutral foreign policy, and to abide by the Japanese Constitution. The appeal calls on all Japanese workers to prepare to continue striking to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." The appeal calls for large-scale mass rallies to be held in various parts of Japan on March 28th.

    日本社会党、共产党等进步民主力量
    一致支持张奚若浅沼共同声明
    表示要加强打倒岸内阁、废除日美“安全条约”的斗争
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：今天举行的日本社会党领导干部会议，正式表示同意日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎和中国人民外交学会会长张奚若在17日发表的共同声明。社会党认为，这项共同声明是符合社会党的方针的。
    社会党在领导干部会议上还决定要动员要求恢复日中邦交的舆论，积极推进要求岸信介政府改变外交政策的国民运动。会议还决定，社会党要在即将举行的地方和参议员选举的竞选中，积极展开要岸信介内阁改变外交政策的活动。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎今天发表谈话，表示欢迎这项共同声明。他说：中国方面和社会党代表团“就在亚洲和太平洋地区建立非核武装地区，建立以日本、中国、美国、苏联为主要成员的亚洲集体安全体系等日中两国共同有关问题上取得完全一致的意见，实在令人高兴。”
    铃木指出，共同声明表明，在岸信介内阁奉行追随美国、敌视中国的政策的情况下，恢复日中邦交和恢复日中贸易是不可能的。铃木还指出，虽然岸信介政府在即将举行选举的时候，装出好像要努力恢复日中贸易的样子，但是只要它不改变敌视中国的政策，他就不会成功。铃木表示，社会党要以这次代表团访问中国的成果为基础进行斗争，使粉碎日美“安全条约”和恢复日中邦交的国民运动更加高涨，并且争取打倒岸信介内阁，来回答热烈希望实现和平独立、恢复日中邦交和日中贸易的全体日本人民的期望。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本共产党和各界团体热烈支持社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎同中国人民外交学会会长张奚若在17日发表的共同声明。
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治表示，日本共产党完全同意共同声明的精神，并且愿在这个基础上为进一步加强同社会党和其他群众团体的联合行动而努力。他还表示，希望社会党在共同声明中表示的路线上团结起来，并且加强同人民的结合，采取绝不同敌人妥协的态度，共同协作，展开联合行动。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章表示衷心支持共同声明。他说，恢复日中邦交国民会议从此以后将全力为使广泛的人民加深认识共同声明的精神和为实现共同声明所指向的目标而奋斗。
    风见章说，凡是要求打开日中关系僵局的人，都应支持这项声明，只有美帝国主义的走狗才反对这项声明。他还指出，这项声明势必在保守政党内部产生影响。
    宫本显治和风见章在谈话中还一致指出，从此以后，日本共产党和社会党以及恢复日中邦交国民会议等日本民主力量，能够高举着鲜明的旗帜——美帝国主义是日中两国人民共同的敌人，整齐步伐，为粉碎日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交、争取日本的中立化而展开联合斗争。
    他们还指出，共同声明对这个斗争将起有益的作用，并使它向前发展。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章表示，总评议会全面支持共同声明。
    他指出，共同声明指明：粉碎日美“安全条约”体系是日中两国人民目前的紧急课题。岩井表示，为了实现这个目标，属于总评议会的工人将进一步加强斗争。
    岩井谈到关于增进日中两国人民间的友好往来时表示，他们将为创造中国方面的代表能够前来日本访问的条件而奋斗。
    据今天的“日本经济新闻”报道，日本贸易界人士对共同声明的反应是：除了岸信介政府改变对中国的政策，并和中国谈判以外，日中贸易是无法恢复的。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改和争取废除日美安全条约国民会议”的十四个发起组织17日晚上发表了呼吁书，号召日本一切团体和个人参加预定在3月28日成立的“阻止修改和争取废除日美安全条约国民会议”。这些发起组织包括日本社会党、共产党和日本工会总评议会等。
    呼吁书说，日美“安全条约”不仅限制了日本的独立，在日本设立了许多美国军事基地，而且修改后的“安全条约”将进一步加强“安全条约”的体系、扩大日本的军队、实行日本的核武装和使得日本和台湾、南朝鲜结成联盟，而成为进攻亚洲国家的基地。呼吁书强调说，这是日本人民的严重危机。
    呼吁书号召所有日本人民为反对修改“安全条约”以及废除这个条约而斗争。
    呼吁书说，要使日本的真正安全能够得到保障，只有不参加任何军事集团，执行独立和积极中立的外交政策，以及遵守日本宪法。呼吁书号召所有的日本工人准备继续罢工以阻止修改“安全条约”。呼吁书要求日本各地在3月28日举行大规模的群众集会。
