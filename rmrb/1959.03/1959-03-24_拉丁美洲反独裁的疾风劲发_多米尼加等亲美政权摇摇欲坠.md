The great victory of the Cuban people's struggle against the dictatorial regime is having a profound impact in Latin America, especially in the few remaining dictatorial or quasi-dictatorial countries. The struggles of the people of the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Haiti against pro-American dictatorial regimes have become even more激昂激昂.

    According to reports, Dominicans exiled in Venezuela and Cuba have organized various political organizations against the Trujillo dictatorial rule and launched various activities to liberate the Dominican Republic. Patriots in Paraguay have also established the "Paraguayan National Liberation Front" in Uruguay. The purpose of this organization is to lead and promote the Paraguayan people's struggle to overthrow the Stroessner dictatorial rule and establish a national democratic provisional government. Participants include the Liberal Party, the February Party, the Communist Party, democratic elements in the ruling National Republican Association, and Catholics. Patriots in Nicaragua have also established the "Nicaraguan Patriotic Association" in Venezuela and called on the Nicaraguan people to unite and overthrow the pro-American Luis Somoza regime. Haitian exiles in Cuba have also established the "Haitian Revolutionary Front" to overthrow the pro-American Duvalier regime.

    Due to the serious deterioration of the domestic economic situation and the intensified repressive measures of the ruling group, popular discontent in these countries has generally increased, and the struggle against the pro-American dictatorial regimes is developing. In some countries, organizations for armed struggle have also emerged. According to a report in the Puerto Rican "El Mundo" based on a conversation with a well-known activist who returned from the Dominican Republic, the vast majority of people in the Dominican Republic are living in increasing poverty, while a small group of dictator's cronies who control the country's main resources are making a fortune. Popular discontent with the Trujillo dictatorship is growing, and has recently spread to the army. The growth of discontent in the army has caused Trujillo great panic. According to the Cuban "Noticias del Día," Trujillo cracked down on a case of overthrowing the dictatorial government in January and arrested Richardson, the head of the country's navy, and a group of officers.

    In southern Paraguay, the armed struggle organization "Citizens' Army for Paraguayan Freedom" emerged not long ago. A statement issued by the Free Citizens' Army stated that the purpose of this organization "is to abolish the existing autocratic regime and establish a democratic regime." A military "rebellion" also occurred in the Chaco region of Paraguay. General Granno, the principal of the Paraguayan Military Academy, General Ovando, the leader of the Military Aviation Corps, and more than two hundred other officers have been arrested. In the Paraguayan border area near Argentina, members of exiled organizations carrying weapons and aiming to overthrow the dictatorial regime are often active. In addition, discord has occurred among the military leaders in Paraguay, and friction has also occurred within the ruling National Republican Association. There are also contradictions between the National Republican Association and the army. The National Republican Association's suggestion to establish armed militia teams outside the army is a concrete manifestation of this contradiction.

    The situations in Nicaragua and Haiti are also extremely unstable. According to reports, Nicaraguan President Somoza admitted at a press conference that Nicaraguan political exiles are preparing to carry out a revolution to overthrow his government, and this movement is led by General Carlos Pasos. In Haiti, the three opposition parties that make up the "Haitian Revolutionary Front" have demanded the resignation of Haitian President Duvalier.

    The United States is trying to save the few remaining pro-American dictatorial regimes in Latin America that are tottering. One of its new methods is to intensify the creation of tension in the Caribbean region. The Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Nicaragua are all countries in the Caribbean region. The dictators of the Dominican Republic and Haiti have recently been clamoring about the so-called "tension" existing in the Caribbean region. Haitian President Duvalier, out of thin air, used the excuse that Haiti is facing the danger of "invasion from Cuba" to demand that the United States "take immediate measures" to "maintain the security of the Caribbean region." At the same time, the Dominican Republic's 10,000 troops were ordered to the border with Haiti, threatening to "guard against back door attacks by non-Haitian forces." The United States also supports the dictators of the Dominican Republic and Haiti in creating tension materially and in action. According to a report by "New York Times" Washington correspondent Kenworthy, the U.S. State Department has decided to support the Duvalier regime in Haiti, predicting that if he is overthrown, it "will put Haiti in a state of complete chaos." In addition to sending a naval mission to Haiti to "train" the Haitian army, the United States has also announced an emergency aid of six million U.S. dollars to Haiti. It is also reported that with the direct help of the United States, the Dominican Republic is establishing a special marine corps modeled after the U.S. Marine Corps. More noteworthy is that the U.S. Navy is currently conducting so-called "anti-submarine" exercises in the South Pacific and the Caribbean Sea of the Atlantic Ocean in two teams. The Cuban "Hoy" pointed out in an article entitled "The Source of Tension in the Caribbean Region" that behind the Haitian dictator Duvalier's request for U.S. intervention under the pretext of a fictional Cuban invasion lies this conspiracy of the United States: to maintain its position at the junction of North and South America, to ensure U.S. rule and exploitation of this important region.

    However, the struggle of the people of Latin American countries against pro-American dictatorial regimes is an unstoppable historical trend, and no force can save the collapse of a regime opposed by the entire people. The U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" reported acknowledging that the wind of anti-dictatorship is sweeping through Latin America. The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" could not conceal this fact either: "The days when Trujillo, Duvalier, and others share the fate of Jiménez and Batista are not far off."

### 拉丁美洲反独裁的疾风劲发  多米尼加等亲美政权摇摇欲坠

    拉丁美洲反独裁的疾风劲发
    多米尼加等亲美政权摇摇欲坠
    本报讯　古巴人民反独裁政权斗争的巨大胜利，正在拉丁美洲特别是在几个残存的独裁或趋向独裁的国家里，发生着深远的影响。多米尼加、巴拉圭、尼加拉瓜和海地等国人民反对亲美独裁政权的斗争更加激昂起来。
    据报道，流亡在委内瑞拉和古巴的多米尼加人，纷纷组织各种反特鲁希略独裁统治的政治组织，并且展开了解放多米尼加的各种活动。巴拉圭的爱国者也在乌拉圭成立了
  “巴拉圭民族解放阵线”。这个组织的宗旨是领导和推动巴拉圭人民推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁统治和建立全国性的民主临时政府的斗争。参加的有自由党、二月党、共产党、执政党国家共和党中的民主分子和天主教徒。尼加拉瓜的爱国者也在委内瑞拉成立了“尼加拉瓜爱国者协会”，并号召尼加拉瓜人民团结一致推翻亲美的路易斯·索摩查政权。在古巴的海地流亡者也成立了“海地革命阵线”，从事推翻杜瓦利埃亲美政权的工作。
    由于国内经济情况严重恶化和统治集团的加紧镇压措施，这些国家人民的不满情绪普遍增长，反对亲美独裁政权的斗争正在发展，有些国家并出现了武装斗争的组织。据波多黎各“世界报”根据从多米尼加回来的一位著名活动家的谈话报道说，多米尼加广大人民生活日益贫困，控制国家主要富源的一小撮独裁者的走狗却大发横财。人民对特鲁希略独裁制度的不满情绪日益增长，最近还扩展到军队之中。军队中不满情绪的滋长使特鲁希略极为恐慌。据古巴“国民日报”报道，特鲁希略曾在1月间破获了一项推翻独裁政府的案件，并且逮捕了这个国家的海军首脑理查逊及一批军官。
    在巴拉圭南部，不久以前出现了“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”的武装斗争组织。自由公民军发表的一项公告说，这个组织的目的“是要取消现存的专制政权，建立民主政权”。在巴拉圭查科地区也曾发生过军事“叛乱”。巴拉圭军事学校校长格兰诺将军、军事航空队领袖奥范多将军和其他二百多个军官已被逮捕。在靠近阿根廷的巴拉圭边境地区常有携带武器的旨在推翻独裁政权的流亡组织的成员在活动。此外，在巴拉圭的军事领袖中间发生了不和，在执政的国家共和党内部也发生了摩擦。国家共和党和军队之间也有矛盾。国家共和党曾建议在军队以外成立武装民兵队，就是这种矛盾的具体表现之一。
    尼加拉瓜和海地的情况也极不稳定。据报道，尼加拉瓜总统索摩查在一次记者招待会上承认，尼加拉瓜的政治流亡分子，正在准备进行推翻他的政府的革命，这一运动是由卡洛斯·帕索斯将军领导的。在海地，组成“海地革命阵线”的三个反对党曾要求海地总统杜瓦利埃辞职。
    美国正在设法挽救拉丁美洲残存的几个摇摇欲坠的亲美独裁政权。它的一个新手法就是在加勒比海地区加紧制造紧张局势。多米尼加、海地和尼加拉瓜都是属于加勒比海地区的国家。多米尼加和海地的独裁者最近以来大肆叫嚣在加勒比海地区存在着所谓“紧张局势”。海地总统杜瓦利埃无中生有地借口海地面临“来自古巴入侵”的危险，要求美国“立即采取措施”，以“维护加勒比海地区的安全”。与此同时，多米尼加的一万名军队奉命开往同海地接壤的边境，扬言要“提防非海地部队的后门攻击”。美国还从物质上和行动上支持多米尼加和海地的独裁者制造紧张局势。据“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者肯沃锡报道说，美国国务院决定支持海地的杜瓦利埃政权，预料他如果被推翻“会使海地处于完全混乱状态”。美国除了向海地派了一个海军使团去“训练”海地军队外，还宣布给予海地六百万美元的紧急援助。另据报道，在美国的直接帮助下，多米尼加仿照美国的海军陆战队建立一支特殊的海军陆战队。更值得注意的是，美国海军目前正分两队分别在南太平洋和大西洋的加勒比海举行所谓“反潜艇”演习。古巴“今日报”在一篇题为“加勒比海地区紧张局势之源”的文章中指出，海地独裁者杜瓦利埃在虚构的古巴入侵的借口下，要求美国进行干涉的背后，还隐藏着美国的这一阴谋：力图保持它在美洲南北部接合点的阵地，以确保美国对这个重要地区进行统治和剥削。
    但是，拉丁美洲各国人民反对亲美独裁政权的斗争正是一股不可阻挡的历史潮流，任何力量都挽救不了遭到全民反对的那个政权的垮台。美国“基督教科学箴言报”报道承认，反独裁之风正吹遍拉丁美洲。“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”也不能掩饰这一事实：“特鲁希略、杜瓦利埃和其他人分享希门尼斯和巴蒂斯塔命运的日子已经不远了”。
