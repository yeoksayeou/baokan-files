Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Japanese Socialist Party delegation, led by Asanuma Inejirō, arrived in Beijing by plane this morning at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The Japanese Socialist Party had sent a goodwill mission to China in the spring of 1957, and this is their second visit to our country.
    Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, expressed a warm welcome to the Japanese friends in his speech at the airport. He said: "In the past two years, the Japanese Socialist Party has made great efforts to promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and to improve Sino-Japanese relations, and has put forward clear propositions, such as resolutely opposing the 'two Chinas' conspiracy and advocating that political and economic issues between China and Japan must be discussed and resolved simultaneously, which have played a significant role in clarifying many misunderstandings in Sino-Japanese relations."
    Zhang Xiruo said: "Although the Kishi Nobusuke government is pursuing the United States' aggressive policy and continues to be hostile to China today, we Chinese people know how to distinguish between friends and enemies. We always sincerely welcome friends. Although Kishi Nobusuke has created many obstacles in the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, we believe that through the joint efforts of the people of both countries, the friendly relations between the two peoples will continue to develop." Zhang Xiruo concluded by saying that we believe that this visit by the Japanese Socialist Party delegation will be of great significance in breaking down the obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations and further promoting the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.
    Asanuma Inejirō then delivered the following speech:
    Mr. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and friends of the People's Republic of China:
    We are very grateful for your welcoming us.
    Thanks to the kindness of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, our Japanese Socialist Party delegation is very pleased to be able to visit your country again. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to the Chinese gentlemen on behalf of the entire delegation.
    Two years ago, our Japanese Socialist Party delegation visited China and had frank talks with you. We were very touched by your friendship that did not dwell on the past and your progress forward. Although diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not yet been restored, we have reached agreements on exchanges and friendship in various fields. Later, more than forty Japanese non-governmental organizations visited China, signed many temporary agreements, and conveyed to the Japanese people the friendship of a China that is leaping forward. However, we regret that the unfriendly policies adopted by our reactionary conservative government and the Nagasaki flag incident since last year have caused displeasure to your country. At the same time, we are ashamed that our strength, that is, the strength of peace and innovation, has not developed sufficiently.
    We, the Japanese people, have protected the peaceful constitution, and we will certainly be able to realize the policy of peaceful coexistence in our country that the people of your country and the people of all Asia hope for.
    Our Socialist Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee in January this year. The meeting decided to make the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations the focus of the 1959 activities, and decided to send a Japanese Socialist Party delegation to visit your country as part of this activity.
    We hope that through this visit, we will be able to frankly exchange opinions on many important issues existing between the people of Japan and China, especially based on the wishes, opinions and ideas of the Japanese people, enhance mutual understanding between the people of the two countries, eliminate the current unfortunate situation, and further develop the friendly relations between the people.
    We were very moved by the achievements made by the Chinese people in the struggle against nature during our journey from Guangzhou to Beijing. We wish China success.
    The members of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation are:
    Leader:
    Inejirō Asanuma (Central Executive Committee Member, Secretary-General, Member of the House of Representatives)
    Members:
    Seiichi Katsumada (Central Executive Committee Member, Chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council, Member of the House of Representatives)
    Soji Okada (Central Executive Committee Member, Director of the International Bureau, Member of the House of Councilors)
    Masaru Sone (Central Executive Committee Member, Chairman of the National Movement Committee, Member of the House of Councilors)
    Satoshi Nakazaki (Central Executive Committee Member, Chairman of the Special Committee for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Member of the House of Representatives)
    Tadatake Sata (Chairman of the General Assembly of Members of the House of Councilors, Member of the House of Councilors)
    Toshio Tanaka (Central Executive Committee Member, Member of the Policy Affairs Research Council, Member of the House of Representatives)
    Attendants:
    Kenichi Hirosawa (Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Policy Affairs Research Council)
    Akira Watanabe (Responsible for Asian and African Affairs in the International Bureau)
    Suematsu Tasaki arrived in Beijing with the delegation.
    Those who welcomed the delegation at the airport included Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, Xu Shengwu, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Zhou Gengsheng, Vice President of the Foreign Affairs Institute, Wu Maosun, Secretary-General, Xie Nanguang, and Yang Chunsong, Council Members.
    Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and others in Beijing also went to welcome the delegation.
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, severely condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for following the United States in intensifying its policy of hostility towards China at the banquet held tonight in honor of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation. He also solemnly pointed out that the Chinese people will never tolerate the Kishi Nobusuke government's duplicitous approach of being hostile towards China.
    In his speech at the banquet held by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs tonight to welcome Asanuma Inejirō and the Japanese Socialist Party delegation led by him, Zhang Xiruo reviewed the changes in Sino-Japanese relations since the visit to China by the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission in 1957, and expressed his gratitude to the Japanese Socialist Party for its efforts to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people in the past two years.
    Zhang Xiruo said that the Chinese people fully support the Japanese Socialist Party's proposal to break the Japan-U.S. security system and for Japan to take the road of peace and neutrality; agree with the Japanese Socialist Party's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone; and welcome the Japanese Socialist Party's repeated and clear expression of its position on restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and opposing "two Chinas." He said that the people of our country are willing to cooperate with friends from the Japanese Socialist Party and continue to work to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. When talking about the relations between China and Japan, Zhang Xiruo reiterated the position expressed by the spokesperson of our government on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations, pointing out that this position of the Chinese people is impossible to change in any way. He emphasized that as long as the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its policy of hostility towards China, continues to play the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and continues to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, trade relations between China and Japan cannot be restored, and the current stalemate between the two countries cannot be broken.
    Zhang Xiruo said that despite this, the people of our country have always been friendly to the Japanese people. We and our friends from the Japanese Socialist Party have so many common points on issues such as defending peace, improving Sino-Japanese relations, opposing American aggression, upholding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and striving to establish an Asian peace and neutrality zone and a nuclear-free zone. We are friends and comrades-in-arms for peace.
    Zhang Xiruo's speech (full text on page 4) was repeatedly greeted with welcoming applause from Chinese and Japanese people attending the banquet.
    Asanuma Inejirō then spoke at the banquet (full text on page 4). After talking about the development and changes in Sino-Japanese relations since the visit to China by the Japanese Socialist Party delegation two years ago, he said, "We are here this time to discuss the following issues. First, the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, Asian peace, the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Far East, the convening of the Second Asian-African Conference, and world peace. Second, economic cooperation issues, such as the exchange of people, culture, and technology, especially those that have been interrupted. We want to discuss the interrupted issues, but we sincerely convey the feelings and hopes of the Japanese people, and we hope that through frank exchange of opinions, the relations between the two countries will move forward. "
    Those who attended the banquet tonight included people from all walks of life in China: Liao Chengzhi, Liu Changsheng, Li Dequan, Wang Zhen, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Li Zhuchen, Cai Tingkai, Lei Renmin, Zhou Gengsheng, Hu Yuzhi, Ji Chaoding, and others.
    Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and others in Beijing were invited to attend the banquet. (Attached picture)

    日本社会党代表团到北京
    中国人民外交学会设宴欢迎贵宾
    新华社7日讯　应中国人民外交学会邀请前来我国访问的日本社会党访华代表团，今天上午由浅沼稻次郎率领乘飞机到达北京。日本社会党曾在1957年春天派遣亲善使节团访问过我国，这次是他们对我国的第二次访问。
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若在机场的讲话中对日本朋友们表示热诚的欢迎。他说：“这两年来，日本社会党在促进中日两国人民友好和改善中日关系上作了很大的努力，并且提出了明确的主张，例如坚决反对‘两个中国’的阴谋，主张中日两国间的政治和经济问题必须同时商谈和解决等，对澄清中日关系上的许多误解都起了重大的作用。”
    张奚若说：“尽管岸信介政府追随美国的侵略政策，今天仍继续敌视中国，但是我们中国人民懂得如何把朋友和敌人区别对待。对朋友我们永远是竭诚欢迎的。尽管岸信介在中日两国人民间的友好方面制造了许多障碍，但我们相信，经过中日两国人民的共同努力，两国人民的友好关系将继续向前发展。”张奚若最后说，我们相信，日本社会党访华代表团这次来访，对于打破中日关系上的障碍和进一步促进中日两国人民之间的友好将具有重大的意义。
    浅沼稻次郎接着发表了如下的讲话：
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若先生、中华人民共和国的各位朋友：
    承蒙各位先生前来欢迎，我们非常感谢。
    由于中国人民外交学会的好意，我们日本社会党访华代表团能够再一次访问贵国，感到非常高兴，我愿意借此机会，代表全团向中国的各位先生讲几句话。
    两年以前，我们日本社会党代表团访问中国，同各位先生坦率地进行了交谈。各位先生不咎既往的友情和向前迈进的情况，使我们很感动。尽管日中两国的邦交还没有恢复，但是我们还是在各方面达成了有关交流和友好的协议。后来，又有四十多个日本民间团体访问了中国，签订了许多临时性协定，并且向日本人民传达了跃进中的中国的友情。但是去年以来我国反动的保守政府所采取的不友好的政策和长崎国旗事件的发生等，给贵国带来了不愉快，我们感到很遗憾，同时对于我们的力量，即和平和革新的力量没有发展到足够的地步，感到惭愧。
    我们日本国民保卫住了和平宪法，同样也一定能够在我国实现贵国人民以及全亚洲人民所希望的和平共处的政策。
    我们社会党在今年1月召开了中央委员会扩大会议。会议决定把废除日美安全条约和恢复日中邦交做为1959年活动方针的重点，并作为这个活动的一环，决定派遣日本社会党代表团访问贵国。
    我们期望，通过这次访问，就日中两国人民之间存在的许多重要问题，特别是要根据日本国民的愿望、意见和想法，来坦率地交换意见，增进两国人民的相互了解，消除目前的不幸状态，使人民的友好关系再次得到进一步的发展。
    我们从广州到北京的途中看到了中国人民在自然斗争中所取得的成就，这使我们很受感动。祝中国成功。
    日本社会党访华代表团的成员是：团长：
    浅沼稻次郎（中央执委、书记长、众议员）团员：
    胜间田清一（中央执委、政策审议会会长、众议员）
    冈田宗司（中央执委、国际局长、参议员）
    曾弥益（中央执委、国民运动委员长、参议员）
    中崎敏（中央执委、恢复日中邦交特别委员长、众议员）
    佐多忠隆（参议院议员总会会长、参议员）
    田中稔男（中央执委、政策审议会委员、众议员）随员：
    广泽贤一（政策审议会事务局次长）
    渡边朗（国际局负责亚非事务）
    与代表团同行到达北京的，有田崎末松。
    到机场欢迎的，有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜，对外文化协会会长楚图南，中国红十字会总会会长李德全，中国国际贸易促进委员会副秘书长徐绳武，外交学会副会长周鲠生、秘书长吴茂荪、理事谢南光、杨春松等。
    前往欢迎的还有在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一等。
    据新华社7日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今天晚间在欢迎日本社会党访华代表团宴会上严厉谴责岸信介政府追随美国变本加厉地执行敌视中国的政策，并且严正指出：中国人民绝不能容忍岸信介政府敌视中国的两面三刀的做法。
    张奚若在中国人民外交学会今晚欢迎浅沼稻次郎和由他率领的日本社会党访华代表团宴会上的讲话中，回顾了日本社会党访华亲善使节团从1957年访问中国以来中日两国关系上的变化，并且对日本社会党在这两年来，为增进中日两国人民的友谊所进行的努力表示感谢。
    张奚若说，中国人民完全支持日本社会党提出的打破日美安全体制和日本走向和平中立道路的主张；赞同日本社会党提出的设立非核武器地带的主张；欢迎日本社会党一再明确表示的恢复中日邦交和反对“两个中国”的主张。他说，我国人民愿意同日本社会党朋友们合作，为促进中日两国邦交的恢复而继续努力。在谈到中日两国的关系时，张奚若重申了我国政府发言人就中日关系问题所表示的立场，指出中国人民的这种立场是不可能有任何改变的。他强调说，只要岸信介政府一天不改变它敌视中国的政策，继续玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，继续阻挠中日关系的正常化，中日两国的贸易关系就无法恢复，两国目前的僵局就无法打开。
    张奚若说，尽管如此，我国人民对日本人民始终是友好的。我们和日本社会党的朋友在保卫和平、改善中日关系，反对美国侵略、拥护和平共处五项原则和万隆精神、争取设立亚洲和平中立地带和无原子区域等问题上有这么多共同点，我们是朋友，又是和平的战友。
    张奚若的讲话（全文见第四版）不断获得出席宴会的中日两国人士的欢迎掌声。
    浅沼稻次郎接着在宴会上讲话
  （全文见第四版）。他谈到了两年前日本社会党代表团访问中国以来中日关系的发展和变化的一些情况后说，我们这次来准备就下列各项问题进行商谈。第一、恢复日中邦交、亚洲和平、在远东设立非核武装地区、召开第二次亚非会议以及世界和平的问题。第二、经济合作的问题，关于人物来往、文化、技术交流等问题，特别是愿意就曾经一度中断的问题进行商谈。我们想商谈中断了的问题是会有困难的，但是我们诚心诚意地转达日本人民的心情和希望，我们希望能够通过坦率地交换意见，使两国关系前进一步。
    参加今晚宴会的，有中国各方面的人士：廖承志、刘长胜、李德全、王震、楚图南、许广平、李烛尘、蔡廷锴、雷任民、周鲠生、胡愈之、冀朝鼎等。
