    Summarize Experience to Promote Second Quarter Production
    Harbin No. 2 Machine Tool Plant Massively Produces Mining and Rolling Equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, March 23rd) The Harbin No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, having completed its first quarter plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule, conscientiously summarized its first quarter experience and made early arrangements for its second quarter production. Using the first quarter to promote the second quarter, it decided to further increase labor productivity by 66.9% on the basis of a 75.31% increase in the first quarter.
    This year, the plant is undertaking the manufacturing tasks of a large number of important industrial products to support the whole country, such as rolling equipment, mining machinery, and smelting equipment, including a 2,300 mm medium plate rolling mill and belt conveyors with a total length of 3,000 meters. The total weight of these equipment manufactured for Baotou Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel will increase by 1.7 times compared with the entire last year. In order to complete this year's arduous tasks, under the guidance of the idea of "competing for time, competing for initiative, ensuring quality, ensuring quantity, and ensuring safety," the plant's Party committee firmly grasped the initiative of the year's Great Leap Forward, from grasping the monthly plan to focusing on daily plans, daily progress, and daily output. They fully mobilized the masses and established the production plan on a reliable basis, thereby completing the first quarter's national plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule. After the completion of the first quarter's production plan, the Party committee immediately summarized the experience of early and tight grasping in the first quarter, making the work active step by step, and resolved to continue this approach of early, tight, and relentless grasping in the second quarter.
    Some people believe that machining is the weakest link in the plant, with only twenty-six machine tools, making it difficult to achieve another leap forward in the second quarter. After presenting the facts and repeatedly calculating the accounts, it was further realized that since the beginning of this year, workers have created as many as fifty indigenous machine tools of various kinds. This number alone greatly exceeds the total number of all machine tools in the factory in the past few years, and these machine tools will gradually exert their power in the second quarter. This calculation made those who originally lacked confidence also express that the potential is great. Regarding the shortage of labor and other issues, after careful calculation, it was decided to further transform manual operations into mechanical and semi-mechanical operations. The plant initially estimated that if only 10% of the current manual operations, which account for 40% of the production process, are reduced, the plant's labor productivity can be increased by 10%. Through presenting the facts and calculating the overall accounts, people's enthusiasm became higher and higher, and their confidence became stronger and stronger. On the basis of extensively tapping potential, the Party committee re-formulated the output value plan, increasing it from 3 million yuan in the first quarter to 5 million yuan, an increase of 66.7%. In this way, labor productivity was increased by 66.9% compared with the first quarter on the basis of increasing production without increasing manpower.
    Currently, the Party committee has submitted this new plan to the workers for extensive discussion. When the Party committee's plan was passed to the factory's red flag group - the Ma Shurong group, the group's workers' enthusiasm doubled, and they immediately held a meeting to reschedule the original plan to complete the annual task by "July 1st" to be achieved by "May 1st." The news of the Ma Shurong group's revised plan immediately caused a sensation throughout the factory. The Meng Qingli group in the second workshop, the He Chengqin group in the third workshop, and more than twenty other groups all calculated their accounts separately, determined to compete with the Ma Shurong group.

    总结经验促进二季度生产
    哈尔滨第二机械厂为武钢包钢大造矿山轧钢设备
    本报哈尔滨23日电　哈尔滨第二机械厂在提前二十一天完成首季计划的基础上，认真总结第一季度经验，及早安排二季度生产，以一季度促进二季度，决定把劳动生产率在一季度提高75.31％的基础上，再提高66.9％。
    这个厂今年担负着大批支援全国的轧钢设备、矿山机械以及冶炼设备等重要工业产品的制造任务，其中有二千三百公厘中板轧机，总长度达三千公尺的皮带运输机等。这些为包钢、武钢制造的设备的总重量，较去年全年增加一点七倍。为了完成今年的艰巨任务，这个厂党委在“争时间、争主动，保质保量保安全”的思想指导下，紧紧掌握全年大跃进的主动权，从抓月计划进而发展到狠抓日计划、日进度、日产量，充分发动群众，把生产计划建立在可靠的基础上，从而提前二十一天完成了第一季度国家计划。首季生产计划完成之后，党委立即总结了一季度早抓、紧抓，使工作步步主动的经验，决心把这种早抓、紧抓、狠抓的作法在二季度坚持下去。
    有的人认为机械加工是全厂最薄弱的环节，机床只有二十六台，二季度实现再跃进有困难。通过摆事实，反复算账之后，进一步认识到今年以来，工人自己创造的各种各样的土机床就达五十台之多，仅这个数量，就大大超过了几年来工厂全部机床的总数，这些机床都将陆续在二季度内发挥威力。这样一算，就使得原来信心不足的人也表示潜力很大了。又如劳力不足等方面的问题，通过算细账决定进一步变手工操作为机械半机械操作以后，全厂初步估计，仅把目前占生产过程40％的手工操作减少10％，全厂劳动生产率即可提高10％。通过摆事实、算大账，人们干劲越来越高，信心越来越足，在大挖潜力的基础上，党委重新制订了产值计划，由一季度的三百万元，提高到五百万元，提高66.7％。这样，就在增产不增人的基础上使劳动生产率比一季度提高了66.9％。
    目前，党委已把这一新的计划交到工人中去广泛讨论。当党委这一计划传到全厂红旗小组——马树荣小组后，全组工人干劲倍增，立即集会把原订“七一”完成全年任务的计划，提前安排到“五一”实现。马树荣小组修订计划的消息顿时轰动全厂，二车间孟庆利小组、三车间何承勤和其他二十几个小组都纷纷各自算细账，决心与马树荣小组比高低。（附图片）
