Editor's note: Cultivating strong seedlings is an important condition for ensuring timely and dense planting of early rice. Many places are now preparing seedlings for early rice. This article written by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture is very helpful in strengthening seedling cultivation and should be paid attention to.

Strengthening seedling cultivation and preventing seed rot, seedling rot, and seedling death are important tasks in current early rice production.

Preventing Seed Rot
There are two situations where seed rot occurs in seedling fields: one is where the seed grain has not germinated or sprouted, and remains unsprouted after sowing, eventually becoming dead grain; the other is where the young sprouts die after sprouting, becoming dead grain. The main reason for the former type of seed rot is incomplete seed soaking and germination, resulting in blind seeds falling into the field. After falling into the field, the seeds lack sufficient moisture, temperature, and oxygen, and over time, their vital functions are lost, resulting in dead grain. The latter type of seed rot is mainly caused by frost damage to the sprouted grain after falling into the field due to low temperatures and poor coverage, or by the seedling bed becoming muddy and rotten, causing the sprouted grain to sink into the mud, affecting seed respiration and sunlight absorption, leading to suffocation and death. Covering too thickly with mud ash can also affect seed respiration and cause seed rot.

The main ways to prevent seed rot are, first, to carefully select seeds, ensuring that the seeds are full and have strong germination ability. Second, master the proper degree of seed soaking and germination. Seed soaking must be thorough according to the characteristics of the variety. For example, for varieties like Mangzao Geng, the seed soaking period is generally no less than three days, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve uniform germination. When germinating, be sure to maintain uniform temperature and moisture. Soaking the seeds in warm water (around 40°C) for ten minutes before sowing can ensure that the seeds are heated evenly and reduce blind seeds. When the weather turns sunny and germination is not uniform, sowing should not be done in advance to "seize the sunshine," because including some blind seeds will cause seed rot. If time is pressing and sowing must be done early, a staggered sowing method can be used, i.e., sowing the sprouted seeds first, and continuing to germinate the unsprouted seeds, and then sowing them after they have sprouted uniformly. Third, after sowing the sprouted grain, it is necessary to prevent it from being exposed to the air and freezing, and also to prevent covering it too thickly, otherwise it is easy to lose moisture and affect seed respiration. Generally, covering should be to the extent that the seeds are covered, with a maximum thickness of no more than three points. After covering, it should also be prevented from caking. Fourth, when making seedling beds, attention must be paid to doing it early and letting it sit early, sowing when the bed surface is moderately soft and hard, to prevent the seedling bed from becoming muddy and rotten. Fifth, in order to prevent root tumbling, a bamboo tube can be used to gently roll over the seedlings after sowing, which can sink the half-buried seeds into the seedling bed, so that the roots will take hold quickly and will not be easily damaged by heavy rain.

Preventing Seedling Rot
The causes of seedling rot are generally five types: ① Prolonged low temperature and rainy weather causes frost damage to young sprouts, leading to withering and death. ② Water accumulation in the depressions of the seedling bed leads to insufficient oxygen supply and slow rooting; or the seedling bed is too hard, the young roots are too long, and rooting is difficult; or when rooting has not yet solidified, it is attacked by strong winds and rain, causing root tumbling. If root tumbling lasts for a while, the consumption of seed grain nutrients leads to nutritional imbalance, resulting in withering and floating death. ③ Algae grow on the surface of the seedling bed, causing the surface layer to float, and the young sprouts fall over and die. ④ Fermentation of organic fertilizers deprives oxygen and produces toxic substances, causing the young roots to be corroded and die. ⑤ The sprouted grain is parasitized by seedling rot pathogens, white fluffy mycelium appears at the base of the young sprouts, producing "water plums," the young sprouts bend, and the seed grain rots and dies. In addition, due to the parasitism of other bacteria and incomplete seed disinfection, the pathogens invade and deprive nutrients during the growth of young sprouts, causing the young sprouts to wither.

According to existing experience, the above five causes of seedling rot can all be prevented. There are three main ways to prevent it: ① Importance must be attached to making good seedling beds. A poorly made seedling bed often not only fails to become a garden for cultivating strong seedlings, but also becomes a place for causing seedling rot. Experienced farmers do not use raw organic fertilizers (such as green manure, fresh straw manure, etc.) as base fertilizer for seedling fields, because these fertilizers will generate bubbles during the rotting process, causing the seeds to sink, or produce toxic substances that corrode young roots. Secondly, the seedling field must be made as flat as a mirror to prevent the occurrence of low-lying areas accumulating water and high-lying areas being exposed to the sun; before sowing, it must be soft and hard in moderation. ② Before rooting, ensure that the seedling bed is moist. Do not irrigate the seedling bed unless it is absolutely necessary. Because there is a water layer on the seedling bed after sowing, rooting is often slow, which easily leads to floating roots and root tumbling, and is conducive to the proliferation of bacteria and algae, causing crusting, or being parasitized by saprophytic fungi. ③ Strengthen management and prevent frost. Simple low temperature conditions or low temperature for a period of time is not an important reason for causing the rapid death of seedlings. According to experiments, rice seedlings only die 15% in low temperatures of 0 to 5 degrees Celsius for ten days, but after low temperatures, the seedlings' vital functions are fragile, and they are often invaded by pathogens, causing a large amount of seedling rot. The main measure for frost prevention in seedling fields is to cover them. This year, due to the expansion of seedling fields, there is a shortage of covering materials, and ways should be found to solve this. This year, some areas are using rice straw fans to cover them, which is a good method, but old rice straw often carries a large number of pathogen spores (such as rice blast and sheath blight). If it is not treated, it will cause a large spread of pathogens. Therefore, before weaving straw fans, the rice straw must be disinfected with warm water above 60 degrees Celsius for five to ten minutes.

Adopting the above three measures can basically eliminate seedling rot. Using the semi-dry seedling field method for seedling cultivation makes it easiest to implement the above three measures, and all areas should adopt it comprehensively.

In the event of seedling rot, measures should be taken in a timely manner to prevent its spread and expansion. The main methods are: ① If root tumbling or crusting and floating root phenomena occur, fine scorched mud ash can be sprinkled to press down the seedling roots. Gypsum or alum can be applied at 4 to 5 jin per mu to solidify the muddy soil and fix the floating roots. ② When seedling rot occurs or toxic substances corrode young roots and young sprouts, the sewage (rust water) should be drained out on a warm day and replaced with clean river water or pond water. Spray a 1:10 solution of Xilisheng lime powder at 3 to 4 jin per mu; wrap copper sulfate in a small cloth bag and place it at the inlet, dissolving it in the water, using 2 to 3 liang per mu, which can eliminate algae such as moss in about eight hours. ③ Regardless of the type of seedling rot, after water changing, root pressing, and other treatments, a quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer should be applied once, using 5 to 6 dan of dilute human manure per mu to promote the production of new roots.

Seedling Death Problem
After the seedlings take root and grow, when the seedlings are about 1 to 2 cun high, if they are subjected to frost damage, and diseases occur due to frost, seedling death can occur in patches or locally.

The basic measures to prevent seedling death are to strengthen seedling field management. When the seedlings are more than one cun high, water must be irrigated into the seedling bed to maintain a shallow water layer and stabilize the microclimate of the seedling field. During low temperatures, deep water (exposing the seedling tips) should be irrigated to protect the seedlings. When the weather is dry, prevent the shallow water layer from evaporating and causing the seedling bed to lack water. This year, some early-sown seedling fields are covered with oil paper. Attention should be paid to ensuring that the seedling bed is moist during the covering period. Before uncovering the paper, it is best to open air holes to ventilate, exchange air, and exercise the seedlings. When uncovering the paper, choose a sunny and warm day, and reasonably irrigate water to prevent frost after uncovering. Improper management is prone to disease. When seedlings develop pathological damping-off, diseased seedlings should be removed, and 4 jin of 1:10 Xilisheng lime powder should be sprayed per mu. Some data indicate that spraying Bordeaux mixture is also effective.

Direct Seeding and Rapid Seedling Cultivation
In the event of more serious seed rot, seedling rot, and seedling death, re-sowing is required to make up for missing seedlings and adapt to the needs of dense planting. Re-sowing and seedling cultivation before Qingming can generally meet the needs of early rice transplanting. After this period, the temperature rises quickly, and the seedlings grow faster. Generally, seedlings with an age of more than sixteen days can be transplanted. If re-sowing and seedling cultivation is done after Qingming, it may delay the transplanting time. Generally, direct seeding can be used. Rapid seedling cultivation has the advantages of fast time and labor saving, but the seedlings are weak and have poor disease resistance. Its effect on increasing production still needs to be further studied, and it can be used as a last resort.

    怎样防止早稻死谷烂秧死苗
    编者按：培育壮秧是保证早稻适时密植的一个重要条件。现在许多地方正在为早稻准备秧苗。浙江省农业厅写的这篇文章，对加强育秧工作很有帮助，希望引起注意。
    加强育秧工作，防止死谷、烂秧、死苗，是当前早稻生产中的重要任务。
    防止死谷
    秧田产生死谷有两种情况，一是种谷没有萌动或没有出芽，播种后仍不出芽，时间长了就成死谷；一是出芽以后，幼芽死坏，成为死谷。前一种死谷的主要原因是浸种、催芽不透，盲子落田，在落田以后又缺乏足够的水分、温度、养气，时间一久，生活机能丧失而成死谷；后一种死谷的原因主要是芽谷落田后，由于气温低，复盖不良而受冻伤，或由于秧板糊烂，芽谷陷入泥中，影响种子呼吸作用和吸收阳光，以致窒息死亡。用泥灰等复盖过厚，也会同样影响种谷的呼吸作用而造成死谷。
    防止死谷的主要办法，首先是认真进行种子精选工作，种子粒粒饱满，发芽能力就强。其次，掌握浸种、催芽适度。浸种必须根据品种特性浸透，如用芒早粳一类的品种，浸种日数一般不少于三天，否则催芽就很难催齐。催芽时一定要掌握温度、水分均匀。落孵前采用温水（40℃左右）掏种十分钟，可使种谷受热均匀，减少盲子。当天气转晴而催芽未齐时，不能为“抢晴”而提前播种，因为夹有部分盲子落田，就会造成死谷。如时间紧迫，必须及早播种，则可采用分期播种的办法，即把已出芽的先播，未出芽的继续留下催芽，待芽齐以后再播。第三，芽谷播种以后，既要防止暴露在空气中受冻，也要防止复盖过厚，否则容易失去水分和影响种谷呼吸作用的进行。一般以盖没种子为度，最厚不超过三分。复盖以后还应防止复盖物板结。第四，在做秧板时必须注意早做、早搁，当板面软硬适度时播种，防止秧板泥糊烂。第五，为防止翻根，在播种后可采用竹筒轻轻滚过，可把半粒种谷陷入秧板，这样扎根快，不易为大雨冲坏。
    防止烂秧
    发生烂秧的原因，通常所见的大体上有五种：①长期低温阴雨，幼芽受冻害，枯萎死亡。②秧板凹处积水，养气供应不足，幼根扎土缓慢；或由于秧板过硬，幼根过长，扎土困难；或由于开始扎根未固时，受大风雨冲袭，造成翻根，翻根时日稍久，由于种谷养分的消耗，而造成营养失调，以至枯萎死浮。③秧板表面因藻类植物繁生，生皮上浮，幼芽横倒死亡。④由于有机质肥料发酵，夺取养气，产生有毒物质，幼根受到腐蚀死亡。⑤芽谷为苗腐病病菌所寄生，幼芽基部发生白色绒状菌丝，产生“水杨梅”，幼芽弯曲，种谷腐烂死亡。此外，由于其它细菌的寄生，种子消毒不彻底，在幼芽生长时，病原菌侵入夺取养料，使幼芽枯萎。
    上述五种烂秧原因，根据已有经验，都是可以预防的。预防办法有三条：①必须重视做好秧板，秧板做得不好，往往非但不能成为培育壮秧的园地，反而是造成烂秧的场所。有经验的农民，都不采用生的有机质肥料（如绿肥、新鲜草藁厩肥等）为秧田底肥，这些肥料在腐烂过程中会发生气泡，使种谷下陷，或产生有毒物质，腐蚀幼根。其次秧田必须做得平整如镜，防止秧板板面产生低处积水，高处晒白现象；在播种前一定要做到软硬适中。②未扎根前保证秧板湿润，非不得已，不灌水上秧板。因为播种后秧板上有水层，常使扎根缓慢，容易产生浮根、翻根现象，并且有利菌藻繁生，造成结皮，或受腐生菌的寄生为害。③加强管理，防止受冻。单纯的低温条件或低温连续时间并不过久，都不是引起秧苗迅速死亡的重要原因。据试验，水稻幼苗在摄氏零度到五度的低温中，十天仅死亡15％，但低温过后，幼苗生活机能脆弱，往往因此为病菌侵入而造成大量烂秧。秧田防冻的主要措施是进行复盖。今年由于秧田扩大，复盖物缺乏，应该设法解决。今年部分地区采用稻草扇复盖，这是好办法，但旧稻草往往带有大量病菌孢子（如稻热病、纹枯病等），如不经过处理，会使病菌大量传播，因此编草扇以前，稻草必须用摄氏六十度以上的温水消毒五到十分钟。
    采用上述三条措施，基本上可以消灭烂秧。采用半旱秧田办法育秧，最易实现上面三条措施，各地应该全面采用。
    万一发生烂秧，要及时采取措施抑止蔓延扩大。主要办法是：①发生翻根或结皮浮根现象，可撒施细焦泥灰压秧根。每亩可施石膏或明矾四至五斤，以沉实糊泥，固定浮根。②发生苗腐病或有毒物质腐蚀幼根、幼芽时，应在日暖时排出污水（锈水），换入清洁河水、塘水。喷施一比十西力生石灰粉每亩三至四斤；把硫酸铜用小布袋包好，放在进水口，溶入水中，每亩用二至三两，八小时左右可以消灭青苔等藻类。③无论何种烂秧，经过换水、压根等处理，应施用速效性氮肥一次，每亩施稀薄人粪尿五至六担，以促使产生新根。
    死苗问题
    秧苗扎根成长以后，在苗高一至二寸左右时，如果遭受冻害，和因受冻而发生病害，会成片地或局部地发生死苗现象。
    防止死苗的基本措施是加强秧田管理，在苗高一寸以上时，必须灌水上秧板，保持浅水层，稳定秧田小气候。低温时应灌深水（露出苗尖）护秧。天气干燥时，要防止浅水层蒸发而造成秧板缺水。今年有些早播的秧田，以油纸复盖，应注意在复盖期中保证秧板湿润。在揭纸前最好开气洞通气、换气、进行锻炼。揭纸时要选择晴暖天，揭后要合理灌水防冻。管理不当容易发生病害。当秧苗发生病理性立枯病时，应拔去病苗，每亩并喷一比十西力生石灰粉四斤。有些资料指出以波耳多液喷射防治，也有效果。
    直播和快速育秧
    万一发生较严重的死谷、烂秧、死苗现象，就需要补播，以补足缺苗，适应密植的需要。在清明以前补播育秧，一般仍能适应早稻移栽的需要，这一时期以后气温上升快，秧苗生长较快，一般有十六天以上的秧龄就可移栽。在清明以后，再补播育秧，可能耽误插秧时间，一般可采用直播的办法。快速育秧有时间快、劳力省的优点，但幼苗细弱，抗病力差，在增产作用上还得继续研究，不得已时可以采用。
