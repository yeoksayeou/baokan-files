　　Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 22nd: According to the Mongolian "Truth Daily" report: Mongolian party and government leaders Damba, Sürenjav, and others recently went to various provinces in Mongolia to inspect work and met with the working people. Damba, the Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said during a meeting with the working people in Dalanzadgad, the capital of South Gobi Province, that the Mongolian people warmly responded to the decision of the 13th Congress of the People's Revolutionary Party on developing the agricultural and pastoral cooperation movement. So far, more than 90% of the herdsmen's households in the country have joined cooperatives, among which, the herdsmen's households in South Gobi and other provinces have all joined the cooperatives. Based on this development, Mongolia is fully capable of enabling all herdsmen to join cooperatives this year. Damba said that the most important tasks at present are to increase the income of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, conduct political and ideological education for members, and gradually settle the cooperatives. Sürenjav, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia, said during a meeting with the working people in Öndörkhaan, the capital of Khentii Province, that the important task at present is to consolidate agricultural and pastoral cooperatives organizationally and economically. He called on everyone to do a good job in the current central work of lambing, protecting lambs, and preparing for spring plowing.

    达姆巴在南戈壁省视察时指出
    蒙古今年将完成农牧业合作化
    增加合作社收入和加强政治教育是目前重要任务
    新华社乌兰巴托22日电　据蒙古“真理报”报道：蒙古党政负责人达姆巴、苏伦扎布等最近前往蒙古各省视察工作，并且同劳动人民进行了会见。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第二书记达姆巴在南戈壁省省会达兰扎达加特和劳动人民会见时说，蒙古人民热烈响应人民革命党第十三次代表大会关于发展农牧业合作化运动的决定。到目前为止，全国已有90％以上的牧户加入了合作社，其中，南戈壁等省的牧户已全部入社。根据这一发展情况看，今年蒙古完全有条件使所有牧民加入合作社。达姆巴说，目前最重要的任务是，使农牧业合作社增加收入，对社员进行政治思想教育，逐步使合作社定居下来。蒙古部长会议第一副主席苏伦扎布在肯特省省会温都尔汗会见劳动人民时说，目前，重要的任务是从组织上和经济上巩固农牧业合作社。他号召大家做好接羔、保羔、准备春耕等当前的中心工作。
