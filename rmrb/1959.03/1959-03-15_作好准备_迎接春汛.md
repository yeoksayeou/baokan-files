Zhejiang Province

The fishermen of the Zhoushan area are carrying out a revolutionary friendship production competition in order to greet this year's spring fishing season. Each of them has issued a heroic declaration: "Strive for the top, create the best, and be the champions of both the north and south coasts," unanimously expressing their determination to resolutely and comprehensively complete the spring fishing season tasks.

The members of the Xiazhi Commune here have issued a battle declaration to the entire area: the entire commune guarantees to complete 350,000 dan of marine fish catches during the spring fishing season, which is four times the actual output of last year. Shengsi, Gaoting, Baiquan and other communes have risen to the challenge, determined to work hard in the spring and surpass Xiazhi.

Shanghai

As spring warms and flowers bloom, the yellow croaker season in the ocean and the silver fish, knife fish, and shad seasons in the Yangtze River will arrive one after another. Fishermen in Chongming County, Shanghai, are stepping up preparations for various production tools to welcome the spring fishing season's large-scale production. The Haiyang, Jianghai, Hongqi, and Liming fishing cooperatives here have mobilized more than 400 male and female members to engage in spinning yarn, making ropes, knitting nets, and repairing boats in order to rush to manufacture fishing gear. The county has currently knitted 2,217 various fishing nets, processed 3,400 thick and thin ropes, and rushed to manufacture 15 sampans. Fishermen are also actively reforming some backward fishing gear.

Shandong Province

Each management area and production team of the Rongcheng County Jinghai People's Commune, Shandong Province, is actively carrying out preparations for the marine spring fishing season production, striving for a bumper harvest in fisheries this year. The first production team of the commune's fisheries management area has organized 38 girls to establish a rope-spinning factory to meet the need for straw ropes during the spring fishing season. Currently, they are working hard to spin 70,000 catties of straw rope before the spring fishing season. The first management area took advantage of the river, ditch, bay, and reservoir freezing season to organize more than 3,800 people to launch two surprise ice-cellaring operations, cellaring 4.25 million catties of ice, preparing cold storage conditions for the spring fishing season's fishery production.

Guangdong Province

The Zhapo Fisheries Production Area of the Hailing Commune in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, is carrying out large-scale production preparation work to welcome the first marine spring fishing season after communization.

Fishermen throughout the port are acting earlier than in previous years, repairing boats and mending nets on one hand, and studying fishing technology on the other. To adapt to diverse operations, the entire area has newly built 17,000 flying fish nets, 2,000 shark nets, 100 fine-mesh nets, and 4,000 catties of shark longline fishing rods and lines. In addition, it has also built canvas boats and small boats. Due to the unified production arrangements of the commune, this year's spring fishing season preparation work in Zhapo has been done faster and better than in any previous year. (Attached picture)

    作好准备　迎接春汛
    舟山全区渔民为了迎接今年的春汛，开展了革命友谊生产竞赛。他们个个发出“争上游，创第一，南北两岸称魁首”的壮言豪语，一致表示坚决全面完成春汛任务。
    这里的虾峙公社的社员们，向全区发出战表：春汛全社保证完成海洋捕鱼三十五万担，要比去年实际产量翻两番。嵊泗、高亭、白泉等公社都奋起应战，决心大干一春，赛过虾峙。
                            ＊
    春暖花开，海洋黄花鱼汛和长江银鱼、刀鱼、鲥鱼汛，都将先后来临。上海市崇明县渔民正在加紧准备各项生产工具，迎接春汛大生产。这里的海洋、江海、红旗、黎明等渔业社，发动了男女社员四百多人进行摇纱、打绳、结网、修船等赶制渔具工作。全县目前已经结成各种渔网二千二百十七口，加工好粗细绳索三千四百条，赶制好舢舨十五只。渔民们还积极改革了一些落后的渔具。
                              * 
    山东省荣成县靖海人民公社各管理区、生产队，积极进行海洋春汛渔业生产的准备工作，争取今年渔业大丰收。这个社渔业管理区第一生产队，为满足春汛草绳的需要，组织三十八名姑娘建立了纺绳厂。现在，她们正在为春汛前纺好七万斤草绳而紧张地劳动。第一管理区趁河、沟、湾、库结冰季节，组织了三千八百多人，突击窖藏天然冰两次，窖冰四百二十五万斤，为春汛渔业生产准备了冷藏条件。

    广东省两阳县海陵公社闸坡渔业生产区，正在进行大规模的生产准备工作，迎接公社化以后的第一个海洋春季渔汛。
    全港渔民比往年提早行动，一面修船、补网，一面钻研捕捞技术，为适应多种作业生产，全区已新造飞鱼网一万七千张、防鲨网二千张、密网一百张，鲨鱼延绳钓杆线四千斤，此外还造了帆布艇、小艇等。由于公社统一安排生产，闸坡今年的春汛准备工作，比过去任何一年都做得又快又好。（附图片）
