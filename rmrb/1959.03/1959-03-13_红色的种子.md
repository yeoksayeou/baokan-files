	The film "Red Seeds" tells a rather tortuous and dramatic story: Hua Xiaofeng, a female cadre of the New Fourth Army, is a determined and unyielding communist. The Party sends her to work in the enemy-occupied area, with Gao Wang Town as her destination. Unexpectedly, the situation changes en route. Not only can she not reach Gao Wang Town, but she is also tricked and sold to the farmer Wang Lao'er by the businessman Qian Fuchang. In this difficult and embarrassing situation, Hua Xiaofeng is not discouraged at all. She persuades Wang Lao'er and his mother, gaining their sympathy and support; she mobilizes and educates the activists in the village, establishing a Party organization; and through them, she leads the masses in an unyielding struggle against the enemy, achieving great victories. Hua Xiaofeng is truly like a red seed, taking root wherever she falls, blooming fragrant flowers, and bearing abundant fruit. In narrating this story, the film creates many suspenseful moments, making people worry about Hua Xiaofeng's experiences at times, and smile with joy at her wit and bravery at others. And on International Women's Day, seeing films like "Red Seeds" and "Beside the March 8th River" that portray positive images of women ("Beside the March 8th River" is about the agricultural labor model Chen Shuzhen), makes us particularly excited. For thousands of years, Chinese women were oppressed at the very bottom of the darkness, enduring humiliation and living in disgrace; but under the wise leadership of the Party, our sisters have turned themselves over and stood up. They have not only fought bravely against the enemy in the revolutionary historical struggle, but have also contributed incomparably powerful strength in the cause of socialist construction. Hua Xiaofeng, Chen Shuzhen, and others are our glorious banners and role models for women to emulate!

    “红色的种子”

    影片“红色的种子”有一个相当曲折的富于戏剧性的故事：新四军的女干部华小凤，是一个坚毅不拔的共产党员，党派她到敌占区去开展工作，目的地是高王镇。不料中途情况变了，她不但不能到达高王镇，还被商人钱福昌骗卖给农民王老二。处在这种困难尴尬的境况之中，华小凤丝毫没有气馁。她说服了王老二和他母亲，得到了他们的同情和支持；她发动和教育了村里的积极分子，建立了党组织；并且通过他们带领群众向敌人进行不屈不挠的斗争，取得了很大的胜利。华小凤真像一颗红色的种子，落在哪里，就在哪里扎下根，开出芬芳的花朵，并且结出丰盛的果实来。影片在叙述这个故事的时候，制造了许多悬念，使人时而为华小凤的遭遇担惊受怕，时而为她的机智勇敢喜笑颜开；而在“三八”国际妇女节时，看到像“红色的种子”和“三八河边”这类描写正面妇女形象的影片（“三八河边”是写农业劳动模范陈淑贞的），使我们分外振奋。几千年来，我国妇女被压在黑暗的最底层，忍辱含垢地过着日子；但在党的英明领导下，姊妹们却翻了身，站了起来。她们不仅在革命历史斗争中跟敌人英勇作战，而且在社会主义建设事业中贡献了无比强大的力量。华小凤、陈淑贞等人，是我们光辉的旗帜，是妇女们效法的榜样！
