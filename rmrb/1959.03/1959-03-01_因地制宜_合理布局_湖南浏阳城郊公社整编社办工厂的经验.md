Adapting to Local Conditions and Rational Layout
——The Experience of Integrating Commune-Run Factories in the Suburbs of Liuyang, Hunan
Wang Peide

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Liuyang Suburban People's Commune made great achievements. In just a few months, it built more than 2,000 factories for iron smelting, founding, agricultural machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, oil extraction, paper making, firecrackers, and rayon. The total industrial output value for the year accounted for 42% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Over the past year, it has also cultivated an industrial production force, laying a good foundation for the industrialization of the commune.

However, the rapid development of the commune's industry has also brought some problems: 1. Insufficient leadership. The number of factories in the commune soared from 264 before the establishment of the commune to several thousand, while the number of management cadres remained at the original 388. One person has to manage several factories, and sometimes it is difficult to even grasp the situation. As a result, they cannot take care of the political and ideological work, production, and management problems of the factories, and some factories have experienced production declines. 2. With many factories, the use of funds is dispersed, and the role of funds cannot be fully utilized. For example, the commune allocated 1,000 yuan to a brigade, which was originally intended for the brigade's larger No. 1 Agricultural Implement Repair Factory, but the brigade's other seven small repair factories, upon hearing this news, also competed for it, resulting in each factory splitting just over 100 yuan. The No. 1 Agricultural Implement Repair Factory used this money to buy equipment but had no money to buy materials, which affected the completion of the task of manufacturing 2,400 rapid harvesting machines. 3. Too many houses are occupied by factories. Five people boiling saltpeter is a factory, and ten people making fertilizer is also a factory, and both have to occupy civilian houses. The commune's factories occupied more than 4,700 civilian houses, causing a shortage of housing for the masses. 4. With many factories and small scales, technical research and teaching are also restricted. 5. With many factories and dispersed locations, there are too many non-production personnel and non-production expenses.

In order to solve the above problems, the commune's Party committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Industry and Communications Conference, actively carried out the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the commune's industry, putting production on the right track. Their methods and experience are:

I. Comprehensive Sorting, Rational Layout,
	Making a Rectification Plan.

The Liuyang Suburban People's Commune Party Committee conducted a comprehensive sorting of the existing factories based on the principle of "adapting to local conditions, rational layout, facilitating production, and facilitating management." As a result, among these factories: 48 had insufficient resources due to not adapting to local conditions; 714 had too few employees (averaging only 5-15 people per factory) and incomplete equipment; 2,016 were inappropriately located, with an excessive concentration of factories of the same nature (factories of the same nature every half a li to one li); and 689 adapted to local conditions, were rationally distributed, and had good equipment and production. Through sorting, a rectification plan was made: the 48 factories with insufficient resources were abolished. They were dealt with in two ways: one was to completely change their business and engage in industries with local resources; the other was to merge with other factories. For the second and third types of factories, mergers were carried out according to "location planning," with factories with better resources, production, and transportation conditions as the center. The fourth type of factory remained unchanged. As a result of the planning, the entire commune was organized into 383 factories. The scale of the factories was larger than before, with 243 factories having 20 to 50 people, and 140 factories having more than 50 people; the occupancy of civilian houses was reduced by 40%, and non-production expenses were also greatly reduced.

II. Combining Communist Education, Widely Publicizing the
	Significance of Rectification, and Organizing Workers to Discuss the Plan.

After the plan was formulated, the commune Party committee held industrial cadre meetings at all levels to make arrangements. While carrying out communist ideological education, factories and mines vigorously publicized the significance of rectification and mobilized the masses to discuss the rectification plan. More than 8,000 workers from factories and mines across the commune all participated in the "letting a hundred flowers bloom." At that time, there were three different attitudes towards the rectification work: one was active support, believing that rational layout and rectification would bring great benefits to production, greatly reducing waste in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources, and at the same time vigorously promoting production development. The second was an indifferent attitude, saying: "Merging is fine, uniting is fine, as long as we have work to do and food to eat, we neither advocate nor oppose it." The third was unwilling to rectify, let alone merge, and demanded that the status quo be maintained. This was mainly because of the factories that were originally doing well, and they had three fears: first, the leaders of the factories and mines were afraid of losing their leadership positions; second, the workers with higher skills were afraid that after merging, "there are many skilled people, and there are always those who are stronger," and that their wage levels would decline; and third, some workers were afraid that with larger factories, more people, stricter systems, and heavier tasks, they would be restrained and unaccustomed to it.

In view of the above ideological situation, the commune's Party committee repeatedly explained the important significance of rectification to the workers and masses, and guided everyone to review the losses caused to production by the unreasonable layout of some factories in the previous stage, so that everyone deeply realized the benefits of rectification ideologically. At the same time, they launched a great debate on "Will mergers cause losses?" "Will more people cause problems?"
	"Will larger factories be more tiring?" Many people cited countless facts to show that rational layout is a good measure, and the idea that "mergers will cause losses" is wrong and does not view the problem from a developmental perspective. The reason why factories with temporarily poor production are poor is only because of insufficient strength, incomplete equipment, difficult raw materials, and poor technical conditions. After the merger, with more people, more wisdom, and sufficient equipment, everyone will only make progress together, and everyone will be better off, and no one will suffer losses. As for the fear that "larger factories, more people, will be chaotic" and "production tasks will be more stressful" are also unnecessary worries. With the appropriate concentration of factories, the leadership will be stronger, the experience in management will gradually improve, and production will only get better day by day. Through debate, everyone's thinking was cleared, their eyes were brightened, and they looked further. More than 8,000 workers expressed their determination to support the rectification.

III. Democratic Consultation to Handle Specific Issues.

With unified ideological understanding, the work progressed smoothly. It only took two days
	to complete the merger work.

They handled the specific issues in the merging factories in this way: ① The leading cadres basically remained unchanged. Those cadres who did not continue to hold leadership positions were assigned to be workshop directors or other positions. ② Financial issues. Originally, all factories and mines in the commune were managed by two levels of decentralized power. This time, the factories and mines managed by the commune remained unchanged; the factories managed by the brigades also did not exceed the boundaries of the brigade. Only the factories in the brigade were merged, and the financial issues were handled by the brigades themselves. The method was to generally only merge accounts, and the original factory and mine properties and debts were all transferred to the large factory. Private individuals had no right to use them. The factories that were abolished were responsible for their own profits and losses. If the losses were too large and the factory could not handle them, the brigade would coordinate and resolve them. ③ The issue of returned civilian houses was handled by the brigade. In principle, the houses were returned to the original owners, and the original factory was responsible for repairing the damage.

IV. Strengthen Leadership, Improve Systems, and the
	Production Landscape is Renewed.

After the rectification, the commune's Party committee immediately convened a meeting of the general branch industrial secretaries of each brigade and the cadres in charge of industry of the commune and brigades to seriously study the issue of strengthening the leadership of the existing factories and mines. After the meeting, cadres went to help each factory and mine establish and improve various systems, so that production could be put on the right track in a timely manner. The commune's more than 300 factories and mines established 19 Party branches and 35 Communist Youth League branches, elected factory and mine directors and deputy directors, and established factory and mine affairs committees and management committees. According to the needs of production, each factory and mine also set up workshops, sections, and offices, so that there was leadership everywhere and everything was managed by a dedicated person. Each factory and mine also democratically formulated production, life, learning, and meeting systems. Each factory and mine also revised the 1959 plan and work quotas and launched a production competition.

At present, a new atmosphere has emerged in the commune's industrial production. Products that could not be produced by small factories in the past can now be produced after the merger, with more people, more wisdom, and greater strength. New products from various factories are constantly increasing. At the same time, the quality of products has been greatly improved, and income has also increased. After the rectification, the average daily income of the entire commune increased by 50%. The workers are also very happy and praise the wise leadership of the Party in unison.

    因地制宜  合理布局
    ——湖南浏阳城郊公社整编社办工厂的经验
    王配德
    浏阳城郊人民公社在1958年大跃进中做出了很大的成绩，仅仅几个月时间，就兴建了炼铁、翻砂、农械、化肥、农药、榨油、造纸、鞭炮、人造棉等工厂二千多座。全年工业产值占工农业总产值的42％。一年来还培养了一支工业生产队伍，为实现公社工业化奠定了良好的基础。
    但是，公社工业的迅速发展，也带来了一些问题：1．领导力量不足。该社工厂由成立公社前的二百六十四个猛增到几千个，而管理干部仍然是原来的三百八十八人。一个人要管好几个厂子，有时连情况都难以掌握起来，对于工厂的政治思想工作，生产、管理上的问题也就更顾不上了，因而有些工厂发生了减产的现象。2．厂子多，资金使用分散，不能充分发挥资金的作用。如公社分配给一个大队一千元资金，原是给该队一个较大的第一农具修配厂的，但该队另有七个小修配厂得此消息，也争着要，结果每厂平分一百多元。第一农具修配厂用这些钱买了设备就没有钱买材料，影响了这个厂制造二千四百部快速割禾器任务的完成。3、占用民房过多。五个人熬硝是一个厂子，十个人制肥料也是一个厂子，都得占用民房。全社办工厂共占用民房四千七百多间，造成群众住房紧张。4．厂多规模小，技术研究和传授上也受到限制。5．厂多分散，非生产人员、非生产开支过多。
    为了解决上述问题，社党委根据省委工交会议精神，积极进行了公社工业的整编、巩固和提高工作，使生产走上了正轨。他们的作法和经验是：
    一、全面排队，合理布局，
        作出整编规划。
    浏阳城郊人民公社党委把现有的厂子，本着“因地制宜，合理布局，便于生产，便于管理”的原则，进行了一次全面排队。结果，这些厂子中：没有因地制宜资源不足的四十八个；职工太少（平均每厂只有五——十五人）设备又不齐的七百一十四个；布局不当，同一性质的厂子过于集中的二千零一十六个（每半华里至一华里有同一性质的厂子）；因地制宜、分布合理、设备和生产等方面都较好的六百八十九个。通过排队，做出了整编规划：把资源不足的四十八个厂子撤销。分作两种办法处理：一是彻底改行，经营本社本地有资源的工业；二是与其他厂合并。对于二、三种情况的厂子，按照“布点”，以资源、生产、交通等条件较好的厂子为中心布点，进行合并。第四种厂子仍旧不动。规划结果，全社编成三百八十三个厂子。厂的规模较前扩大，二十人到五十人的二百四十三个，五十人以上的一百四十个；占用民房减少40％，非生产开支也大大减少。
    二、结合共产主义教育，广泛宣传整编
        意义，组织职工讨论规划。
    规划制定后，社党委层层召开了工业干部会议进行布置。各厂矿在开展共产主义思想教育的同时，大力宣传整编工作的意义，发动群众，讨论整编规划。全社各厂矿共八千多名职工全部参加了鸣放。当时对整编工作出现了三种不同的态度：一种是积极拥护，认为这样合理布局加以整编，将对生产带来莫大的好处，不仅人、财、物力上大大减少浪费，同时将有力地促进生产发展。第二种是抱无所谓的态度，他们说：“并也好，联也好，我们只要有活干，有饭吃，既不主张也不反对。”第三种是不愿整编，更不同意合并，要求维持现状。这主要是原来办得较好的厂子，他们有三怕：一是厂矿领导怕编掉自己的领导职位；二是技术较高的工人，怕并了后“人多武艺高，强中更有强中手”，怕工资等级下降；三是有的工人怕厂子大了，人多了，制度紧，任务重，受拘束，不习惯。
    针对上述思想情况，社党委反复向职工群众说明进行整编的重要意义，引导大家回顾前阶段部分厂子因布局不合理，给生产上造成的损失，使大家从思想上深刻地体会到编整的好处。同时，开展“合并是不是会吃亏？”“人多是否会误事？”
  “厂大是否更累人？”的大辩论。许多人列举了无数的事实说明合理布局是一条好措施，“合并会吃亏”这种认识是不对的，是没有从发展观点上去看问题。暂时生产较差的厂子，他们之所以差，就只因为力量不足，设备不齐，原料困难，技术条件差所致。合并后，人多、智多、设备足，只会共同进步，大家都好起来，谁也不会吃亏。至于怕“厂大、人多、会乱”“生产任务更压人”也是多余的顾虑，厂子适当集中了，领导力量也更强了，管理工作经验也会逐步提高，生产只会一天天地好起来。通过辩论，大家思想通了，眼睛亮了，望得更远了，八千多名职工纷纷表示决心，拥护整编。三、民主协商处理具体问题。
    思想认识一致了，工作进
    行很顺利，只花了两天时
    间，合并工作就完成了。
    对并厂中的具体问题，他们是这样处理的：①领导干部基本不动。对于没有继续担任领导工作的干部则分配其担任车间主任或其他职务。②财务问题。原来全社所有厂矿是两级分权管理，这次合并，社管的厂矿未动；大队管的厂子也未超出大队界限，只是本队的厂子进行了合并，财务问题即由各大队自己核算处理。方法是一般只并账目，原厂矿财产及债务等一律转入大厂，私人没有动用权，撤销的厂子，盈亏自负，若亏损过多，本厂不能处理，由大队统一调整解决。③退出的民房问题，一律由大队处理，原则上退回原主，损坏由原厂负责修理。
    四、加强领导，健全制度，生产面貌
        焕然一新。
    整编后，社党委即召开了各队总支工业书记和社、队管工业的干部会议，认真研究了加强现有厂矿的领导问题。会后干部分头帮助各厂矿建立健全各种制度，使生产及时走上正轨。全社三百多个厂矿建立了十九个党支部，三十五个团支部，选出了正、副厂、矿长，成立了厂、矿务委员会和管理委员会。按照生产需要，各厂、矿还设了车间、股、室，做到了处处有领导，事事有专人管。各厂矿并民主制订了生产、生活、学习、会议等制度。各厂矿还修订了1959年的计划和工作定额，开展了生产竞赛。
    目前，全社的工业生产已出现了新气象。过去小厂不能生产的产品，并厂后人多智广力量大，可以生产了。各厂的新产品不断增加。同时，产品质量大大提高，收入也增加了。编整后全社每天平均收入增加了50％。职工们也都兴高采烈，齐声颂扬党的英明领导。
