Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th. After five days of meetings, the 12th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions successfully concluded this afternoon. In a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union unanimously approved by the delegates, it was guaranteed that all Soviet workers would be mobilized to strive to complete the magnificent seven-year plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule and actively work to build communism.

Soviet party and government leaders Suslov, Kozlov, Kirichenko, Mukhitdinov, Furtseva, Pospelov, and others attended the closing ceremony of the congress.

This morning, the congress approved the revised Charter of Soviet Trade Unions and elected a new Central Council of All-Union Trade Unions and a Supervisory Committee.

The 12th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions was convened during a new period when the Soviet Union entered a comprehensive phase of communist construction. In accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the conference comprehensively discussed the issues of further improving and enhancing the work of trade unions. This conference will play a significant role in organizing the vast number of workers to rapidly develop the Soviet national economy, enhance the communist consciousness of workers, and increase the material and cultural welfare of the working people.

During the conference, the delegates heard a report by Grishin, Chairman of the Central Council of All-Union Trade Unions, on the summary of trade union work and the tasks of Soviet trade unions in implementing the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, and a report on the partial revision of the Charter of Soviet Trade Unions. The delegates also discussed the above reports.

Forty trade union workers or worker representatives from fifteen union republics spoke successively in the discussion. They unanimously expressed their support for the measures formulated by the Party in recent years to enhance the role of trade unions, and unanimously pointed out that the rights enjoyed by trade unions have been greatly expanded in recent years. They pointed out that trade union work has greater tasks after the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The primary task of trade union work is to ensure the victorious implementation of the resolutions of the Party Congress under the leadership of the Party, further give play to creativity and initiative, actively participate in economic production management, and strictly ensure the completion of production plans.

The delegates pointed out in their speeches that another important task of the Soviet trade unions in the future is to raise the communist consciousness of the workers. Under the leadership of the Party, the trade unions must thoroughly publicize the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and extensively organize workers' universities, night schools, and social education. The work of workers' clubs and workers' newspapers and periodicals, which occupy an important position in strengthening the ideological education of workers, must be further improved.

During the discussions, the delegates unanimously expressed that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the maintenance of world peace and strengthen the ties of the international workers' movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th. The 12th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions concluded its discussion of the report by Grishin, Chairman of the Central Council of All-Union Trade Unions, this morning. The conference unanimously passed a resolution on Grishin's report on "Summary of the Work of the Central Council of All-Union Trade Unions and the Tasks of the Soviet Trade Unions in Implementing the Resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU". In the afternoon, the conference entered the third item on the agenda – the partial revision of the Charter of Soviet Trade Unions.

Gulyayev, Secretary of the Central Council of All-Union Trade Unions, made a report on the partial revision of the Charter of Soviet Trade Unions. Gulyayev pointed out that in recent years, the Party has carried out a series of important reforms in the economic and socio-political life of the Soviet Union, and the trade unions have also been reorganized. Therefore, it is necessary to revise and supplement the Charter of the Trade Unions.

Gulyayev pointed out that these revisions mean that the role of Soviet trade unions is increasing during the period of fully unfolding the construction of a communist society. Now, trade unions should more widely attract the working people to manage production, participate in the formulation of national economic plans, and represent the workers in studying labor issues, the lives and cultural issues of the working people with state organs and economic institutions. At the same time, trade unions should also more actively fight for the solidarity of the international workers' movement and support the just struggle of the working people for their rights and interests.

Talking about the changes in the institutions and functions of the trade unions, Gulyayev pointed out that this is to bring the leaders of various trade union institutions closer to local trade union organizations and closer to the masses of working people.

Gulyayev said that new clauses expanding the rights of members have been added to the chapter on the rights of trade union members. Trade union members have the right to raise questions about the work of trade unions to trade union organs, as well as questions about economic organizations, and have the right to make suggestions on improving their work. Gulyayev went on to say that local trade union committees should participate in the work of enterprises in formulating production plans, lead the work of standing production conferences, scientific and technological associations, and associations of rationalization proposers and inventors, and supervise workers' compliance with labor laws and safety regulations. The local trade union committees have the right to nominate candidates for enterprise leaders, and employees cannot be dismissed without the consent of the trade union committee.

    全苏工会代表大会向苏共中央作出保证
    动员全苏职工提前完成七年计划
    新华社莫斯科27日电　全苏工会第十二次代表大会经过五天的会议以后，在今天下午胜利闭幕。到会代表在一致通过的大会致苏联共产党中央委员会的信中表示，保证动员全体苏联职工力争提前完成宏伟的发展国民经济的七年计划，积极努力建设共产主义。
    苏联党和政府的领导人苏斯洛夫、科兹洛夫、基里钦科、穆希金诺夫、福尔采娃、波斯别洛夫等出席了大会的闭幕式。
    大会在今天上午批准了经过修改的苏联工会章程，并选出了新的全苏工会中央理事会和检查委员会。　
    全苏工会第十二次代表大会是在苏联进入全面展开共产主义建设的新时期召开的。大会根据苏共第二十一次代表大会决议的精神，全面地讨论了进一步改进和提高工会工作的问题。这次大会在组织广大职工迅速发展苏联国民经济、提高职工的共产主义觉悟和增进劳动人民的物质和文化福利等方面将起巨大作用。
    大会在进行期间，曾听取了全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申关于工会工作总结和苏联工会在实现苏共第二十一次代表大会决议方面的任务的报告和关于苏联工会章程的部分修改的报告，代表们并对以上报告进行了讨论。
    十五个加盟共和国的四十个工会工作者或工人代表先后在讨论中发了言。他们一致表示拥护近年来党所制订的旨在提高工会作用的措施，并一致指出，近年来工会享有的权利已大大扩大。他们指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会后，工会工作负有更大的任务。工会工作的首要任务是在党的领导下保证胜利实现党代表大会的决议，进一步发挥创造性和主动性，积极参加经济生产管理工作，严格保证生产计划的完成。
    代表们在发言中都指出，苏联工会今后的另一个重要任务是提高职工的共产主义觉悟。工会必须在党的领导下深入地宣传苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议，广泛组织职工大学、夜学和社会教育。必须进一步改进在加强职工思想教育中占有重要地位的职工俱乐部和职工报刊的工作。
    在讨论中，代表们都一致表示，必须继续加强维护世界和平、加强国际工人运动的联系。
    新华社莫斯科26日电　全苏工会第十二次代表大会今天上午结束了对全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申的报告的讨论。大会一致通过了关于格里申的“全苏工会中央理事会的工作总结和苏联工会在实现苏共第二十一次代表大会决议方面的任务”的报告的决议。大会在下午进入第三项议程——对苏联工会章程的部分修改。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记古烈耶夫作了关于苏联工会章程的部分修改的报告。古烈耶夫指出，最近几年来党在苏联的经济和社会政治生活中进行了一系列重要的改革，工会也进行了改组，因此有必要对工会章程进行修改和补充。
    古烈耶夫指出，这些修改意味着苏联工会在全面展开共产主义社会建设时期的作用日益增强。现在，工会应该更广泛地吸引劳动人民来管理生产，参加制定国民经济计划，代表职工同国家机关和经济机构研究劳动问题、劳动人民的生活和文化问题。同时，工会还应该更积极地为国际工人运动的团结一致而斗争，支持劳动人民争取自身权利和利益的正义斗争。
    在谈到工会的机构和职能方面的改变时，古烈耶夫指出，这是为了使各工会机构的领导人更接近地方工会组织，更接近劳动人民群众。
    古烈耶夫说，在关于工会会员权利这一章中，补充了扩大会员权利的新条款。工会会员有权不仅向工会机关提出关于工会工作方面的问题，而且可以提出关于经济组织方面的问题，有权提出关于改进它们的工作的建议。古烈耶夫接着说，各地方的工会委员会应该参加企业制定生产计划的工作，领导常设生产会议、科学技术协会以及合理化建议者和发明者协会的工作，监督职工遵守劳动法和安全技术条例。各地方的工会委员会有权提名企业领导人的候选人，同时未经工会委员会的同意不得解雇职工。
