To commemorate the centenary of the birth of the great Russian scientist, inventor of radio, and founder of modern radio engineering, Alexander Stepanovich Popov, today is of great significance. Recently, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union victoriously opened a new historical period for the comprehensive construction of communism in the Soviet Union. The Congress called on Soviet scientists to create new technologies for communist construction based on the widespread adoption of new achievements in physics, radio electronics, and other fields, and demanded the realization of radioization in the ideological education work of communism. Our people are launching a high tide of cultural and technological revolution, and are increasingly aware of the importance and urgency of accelerating the development of radio electronics. At this time, we more deeply appreciate the far-reaching impact of Alexander Stepanovich Popov's scientific creation and naturally have high respect. At this time, we cannot help but look back at the major developments in radio electronics in the decades since Popov's invention of radio, and look forward to the increasingly significant role that radio electronics will play in the future construction of socialism and communism, and in the struggle of mankind to further conquer nature and enrich their lives.

    (I)

Since Popov pioneered a new path for the application of basic scientific research on electromagnetic waves and electrical oscillations to the practical life of mankind, through the efforts of Soviet and world scientists for decades, with the continuous development, mutual influence and mutual promotion of modern productive forces and various scientific and technological departments, radio electronics has developed into a technological scientific department with very extensive and rich content in practical application and scientific theory.

In the most recent ten years or more, radio electronics has had new and great developments. Due to the rapid development of ultra-high frequency electronic devices, new situations have emerged in electron vacuum devices. Their power is increasing day by day, noise is decreasing, sensitivity is increasing, adjustable frequency bands are wider, and available wavelengths are shorter (entering the millimeter wave band). The invention of semiconductor devices has triggered another revolution in radio technology, enabling many radio equipment to greatly reduce size, reduce weight, and reduce power consumption, thus enabling radio technology to further penetrate many engineering technology departments. The electronic computers, information theory and cybernetics, low-temperature physics, solid-state physics, quantum amplifiers and parametric amplifiers, nuclear physics, plasma region research, artificial earth satellites and space navigation, new synthetic materials, and new manufacturing processes that have developed in recent years are making radio electronics face a more extensive and far-reaching technological revolution, making radio electronics enter a new, higher, and broader stage of development. As described by Academician Topchubayev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in the article "Communist Construction and Science," "Our era is the era of atomic energy, but it is also correct to call it the era of radio electronics, because radio electronic methods are now applied to all scientific and technological departments."

Radio electronics, which started with Popov's great invention, what does it look like today? Here I would like to briefly talk about its main aspects from the perspective of the practical application of radio electronics:

                    Radio Communication and Television

Although radio communication is the earliest practical application of radio electronics, it has not lost its vitality of continuous innovation and development. Due to the increasing demand for communication volume, the increasing distance required for communication, and the continuous increase in natural and man-made interference, these situations require people to seek new communication methods that are highly reliable, efficient, and economical. Radio relay systems have developed greatly in recent years, and several countries are conducting 1920-channel communication experiments. The current research direction is to reduce interference between antennas, increase communication volume, and improve communication quality. Forward scattering propagation communication has advantages that radio relay systems do not have, that is, it is not affected by solar activity, is not restricted by geographical conditions, and can cross lakes, sea surfaces, forests, and mountains without intermediate stations. Ionospheric scattering propagation has achieved reliable communication of 2,000 kilometers in the 30-60 MHz band. Tropospheric scattering propagation has used centimeter waves to achieve reliable communication of 480 kilometers. The research in this area is developing towards increasing the power of the transmitter, increasing the sensitivity and stability of the receiver, and high-gain narrow-lobe antennas.

Millimeter wave waveguide long-distance transmission is a new communication method that is beginning to be studied and has great development prospects. It has excellent characteristics such as a wide frequency band, low attenuation, and immunity to interference. The realization of this method still requires solving a series of theoretical, experimental, and technological problems, such as eliminating low-order waves, distortion caused by discontinuities, millimeter wave low-noise amplification, signal modulation methods, small attenuation measurement, waveguide processing, and anti-corrosion. However, after the successful research of this method, millimeter waves can be used in a small-section circular waveguide to simultaneously pass tens of thousands of telegraph and telephone lines or hundreds of television programs. It will bring about a huge technological revolution in communication methods, so countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and Japan are conducting a lot of research in this area.

Television has been developing for nearly thirty years. It can not only extend people's vision by hundreds of kilometers, but also display the scenes of high altitude and seabed, as well as places that humans cannot approach (such as environments with explosions, radioactivity, and highly toxic substances) in front of people. In industrial production, television is used in conjunction with automatic production lines to ensure product quality and increase output, and to help people check processes and phenomena that the eyes cannot see. Military television can help commanders quickly and accurately understand the situation and improve combat effectiveness. In cultural life and education, the application of television is becoming increasingly widespread. At present, television is constantly improving its resolution and sensitivity, improving transmission methods, reducing the complexity of equipment, increasing its reliability, and striving to make color television practically and widely applicable.

                      Radar – Radio Ranging

Radar was researched and created based on the phenomenon that electromagnetic waves discovered by Popov can be reflected, before the Second World War. In the most recent ten years or more, it has had great development. The development of radar has expanded the application of radio technology from the field of communication to many aspects such as navigation, measurement, astronomy, and meteorology. At the same time, it has put forward increasingly high requirements for basic work in radio electronics such as transmission, reception, antenna, display, information transmission, pulse technology, and various electronic devices and components, which has greatly promoted the progress of the latter. At present, radar is developing towards increasing the effective range and improving the resolution. The United States is developing a 3,000-mile ultra-long-range radar, and a millimeter-wave radar that can display the shape of targets within 30 kilometers has been manufactured in several countries. The types and models of radar used for different civil and military purposes are very numerous, so the research and manufacture of radar accounts for a very large proportion of the scientific research and industrial production of radio electronics.

                      Electronic Computer

The emergence of electronic computers is a new peak in the development of modern radio electronics and is a true miracle of human endless creative talents. In recent years, with the accelerated development of fast electronic computers and calculation technology, the entire science and technology is undergoing a qualitative leap, and many specialized sciences and technologies in various sectors of the national economy will be profoundly affected. Science and technology will be rapidly mathematized, and all major scientific sectors will become precise academic sectors. We must be fully prepared ideologically and organizationally for this unprecedented, profound, and huge technological revolution and its possible far-reaching impact. Electronic computers are already widely serving all aspects today. It can quickly perform a large number of complex calculations, helping people solve very complicated mathematical calculations in gas dynamics, fluid mechanics, meteorology, and nuclear physics, etc. It can help people control complex and precise production processes and fast-moving processes, and it can also perform scientific data sorting and statistics, and perform text translation. At present, electronic computers are developing towards high calculation speed, high reliability, and more applications.

                        Radio Navigation

Radio navigation has developed with the development of the aviation industry. In increasingly frequent air traffic and with the increasing speed of aircraft, radio navigation is becoming increasingly important. There are already two navigation systems: VHF navigation and long-wave hyperbolic navigation system. These systems can enable aircraft to accurately determine their location, with an error of only tens of meters. It is necessary to further improve the accuracy and reduce the weight of navigation equipment on the aircraft. Modern high-speed aircraft must have a guidance system composed of original information sensors, computers, and autopilots. Automatic radar navigation systems and inertial navigation systems are developing with the increase in aircraft speed. In recent years, due to the construction of nuclear submarines, long-distance underwater navigation has been realized, so solving the navigation problem of submarines has become an urgent need, and a lot of research work is being carried out in this area.

    Radio Technology in Rocket Technology, Artificial Earth Satellites, and Space Navigation

The successful launch of artificial earth satellites and space rockets by the Soviet Union has opened the prelude to space navigation and has put forward many new tasks for radio electronics. First of all, it is necessary to increase the effective range of radio. According to someone's simple theoretical calculation, if a communication machine with a wavelength of 3 cm and a radiated pulse power of 1 megawatt is used, when the area of the transmitting and receiving antennas is 1 square meter, a communication distance of 130 million kilometers can be obtained, and the round-trip time of the signal at this distance is 15 minutes. Obviously, this is a new topic for radio technology. In order to prevent meteorite impacts, since the effective reflection surface of the smallest meteor that can harm the spacecraft is almost only 0.01 square meters, and it has a relative speed of tens of kilometers per second, it is necessary to use radar with extremely short wavelengths (such as 4 mm) to discover them. In order to measure the trajectory of high-speed meteors and quickly change the direction of the spacecraft, there must also be an automatic steering device controlled by a computer. Rocket technology has particularly strict requirements for the anti-vibration, high-temperature resistance, low-temperature resistance, and ultra-miniature performance of electronic devices and various components. Data from various scientific research can only be transmitted to the ground using radio technology. Therefore, when many mechanics workers, engine dynamics workers, high-energy fuel workers, chemistry and metallurgy workers are creatively working for rocket technology and the realization of space navigation, radio electronics workers must also make unremitting efforts for the same purpose.

              Radio Electronics and Atomic Energy Science and Technology

The development of atomic energy science and technology is inseparable from the development of accelerators. It can be said that without the cooperation of radio electronics in the development of cyclotron accelerators, linear electron accelerators, synchrophasotrons, and other types of accelerators, there would be no achievements in atomic energy science and technology today. In order to study certain characteristics of elementary particles, nanosecond and even picosecond pulse technology has been developed. In order to realize the artificial control of thermonuclear reactions, the research of high-current pulsed discharge and the research of plasma region have been greatly developed in recent years. This is a marginal discipline that has grown up between radio electronics and atomic energy science. Many radio electronics workers are working hard in this area, and they are contributing their strength together with atomic energy science workers to realize the further liberation and mastery of the great potential of nature by mankind. The "Ogra" device, which the Soviet Union is currently testing, is an outstanding achievement in this area. Of course, in the scientific research and peaceful utilization of atomic energy, many measuring, controlling, and other various electronic instruments and equipment are still needed. Radio electronics workers must make efforts in many ways to directly and indirectly cooperate with the work of atomic energy.

                      Radio Spectroscopy

This new radio spectroscopy, which has emerged in the last ten years, is a powerful tool for studying the various properties of substances in gaseous, liquid, or solid states using radio technology. It has close links with theoretical physics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and group theory. The application of radio spectroscopy methods observed the shift of the S energy level of the hydrogen atom and discovered the abnormal magnetic moment of electrons, which gave a great impetus to the development of quantum electrodynamics. Applying this method to study molecular structure is of great significance to the theory of chemical bonds. This method can make the quantitative analysis of mixed gases (especially rare gases) rapid and accurate. Using this method to measure the nuclear moments of atomic nuclei has enriched the nuclear theory. The molecular clock is made using the principle that the narrow spectral lines absorbed by gas can make ultra-high frequency oscillation have high stability, and from this we obtain extremely accurate frequency standards. The achievements of radio spectroscopy have advanced the method of generating and multiplying extremely short electromagnetic waves (sub-millimeter) a step forward.

                    Radio Astronomy

Radio astronomy has developed rapidly after the Second World War due to the use of high-sensitivity receivers, antennas, and displays on radar. It has now become one of the most powerful tools for studying the universe. It has opened up new avenues for studying the structure of the sun and stars, the composition and distribution of interstellar matter, and the origin of cosmic rays. Since electromagnetic waves with wavelengths from 1 cm to 20 meters can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and reach the ground, radio astronomy observations can be carried out in any weather conditions, day or night, thus opening up a broad horizon for people. The main objects of radio astronomy observation and research are the radio frequency radiation of the sun, the moon, the Milky Way, and the general galaxy. It has not only discovered previously undiscovered constellations and nebulae, but can also be used to study interstellar matter. Radio telescopes and radio interferometers are the main tools of radio astronomy stations. These two tools are developing towards narrow directivity, high angular accuracy, and high sensitivity. Increasing antenna size and using signal accumulation and low-noise amplification are the main directions of development.

                      Radio Meteorology

Radio meteorology was actually born sixty-four years ago when Popov used his thunderbolt indicator to record lightning at a distance of 30 kilometers. Today radio meteorology serves both radio technology and meteorology. Meteorological factors affect the refraction, scattering, and absorption of radio waves, so radio meteorology can estimate the impact of meteorological factors in the troposphere on radio wave propagation. Radio technology methods can help study the formation of rain, snow, and clouds, as well as the non-uniformity and turbulence of the lower troposphere. There are a variety of radio instruments serving meteorology, such as unattended equipment that can automatically measure various hydrological and meteorological factors (including wind speed, wind direction, air pressure, temperature, humidity, atmospheric deposition, water temperature, etc.), radio sondes, radio anemometers, and meteorological radars. The use of all these radio methods has greatly enriched meteorology; in addition, only with the help of electronic computers can accurate weather forecasts be made quickly and accurately today, enabling people to defend against and overcome the invasion of natural disasters in a timely manner.

                      Application of Ultrasound

Ultrasonic vibration has a wide range of applications due to its many characteristics. Water is a good conductor of sound waves, so the phenomenon of ultrasonic waves propagating in water was first used in the detection, contact, and communication of submarines. Echo sounders can detect the depth of seawater and schools of fish in the sea, becoming a powerful tool for fishing and marine exploration. Pulsed ultrasound can be used to detect the non-uniformity of solids, so ultrasonic flaw detection is widely used in industry to improve product quality and prevent accidents. The cavitation effect of ultrasound in liquids can generate huge pressure and localized temperature increases. This phenomenon can be used to improve metal structures, disinfect liquids, and artificially create emulsions, and can also clean tiny parts. When ultrasound acts on certain chemicals, it can accelerate the reaction and control the process of the reaction, such as accelerating the polymerization process of polymer compounds. Ultrasound can also be used to weld aluminum and stainless steel and tin plating on it, and can also drill holes in brittle and hard materials (such as glass) without damaging the material. In medicine, ultrasound has begun to be used to treat certain neuralgias and detect early symptoms of cancer and tumors, etc. Because the application of ultrasound is becoming increasingly widespread, the problem of how to convert electrical oscillations into sound waves, the propagation of sound waves in different media, and the problem of converting sound waves into electrical oscillations have become an important issue in electronics.

Since radio electronics methods and various electronic instruments and equipment have been applied to almost all scientific and technological departments, it is impossible for us to list them all completely. Such an important scientific research tool as the electron microscope has not yet been mentioned above. And such a comprehensive technical science as automatic technology and remote control technology is largely based on the achievements of radio electronics. We can say that today the level of application of electronic instruments and equipment has become an important measure of the development status of a certain production department and scientific and technological department.

But we must not create a misconception that radio electronics is just an applied and experimental science. On the contrary, radio electronics is a science based on solid theory. With the increasingly widespread development of the application range of radio electronics, its own basic research and theoretical research tasks are also more arduous. Theoretical radio electronics, which is based on the most advanced theoretical basis, is constantly developing due to the use of powerful electronic computers and the achievements of mathematics and theoretical physics, especially classical electrodynamics, quantum electrodynamics, statistical physics, solid-state physics, nuclear physics, and the methods and achievements of mechanics. Through in-depth analysis and extensive summaries, it is constantly absorbing useful nutrients from various brother disciplines to enrich itself, and constantly laying a solid foundation for experimental work, engineering design, and production technology.

                  (II)

Speaking of the situation in our country, we can say that in old China, due to the plunder of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang which suffocated scientific undertakings, the radio electronics industry in our country was in an extremely backward state for a long time. At that time, postal and telecommunications and broadcasting were also not developed. There were only a few radio stations and broadcasting stations with very little power. No colleges and universities in the country had independent radio departments. Only a few colleges and universities had radio courses. There was not a single factory that manufactured radio equipment on its own, and all radio equipment was almost entirely dependent on imports from foreign countries. There was not a single specialized radio research institution, and only a few scientific workers engaged in some sporadic and ineffective research work.

After the founding of New China, the Party and the government attached great importance to and cared for the development of radio electronics. In the Twelve-Year Perspective Plan for the Development of Science and Technology in our country, formulated in 1956, specific arrangements were made for the development direction, research plan, establishment of research institutions, industrial production, cadre training, and other important aspects of radio electronics. The comprehensive leap forward of socialist construction in our country in 1958 further promoted the development of radio electronics in our country, making it possible to realize the twelve-year perspective plan ahead of schedule. In the winter of 1956, the Chinese Academy of Sciences began to prepare for the establishment of specialized research institutions for cutting-edge technologies related to radio electronics, automation, computing technology, and semiconductors. After two years of efforts, practical research work has begun. The postal and telecommunications broadcasting departments, industrial departments, and other industrial departments have established several specialized research institutions and have made certain achievements. After the Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a national conference on radio electronics scientific research work in September 1958, many provinces began to prepare for the establishment of local research institutions related to radio electronics.

In terms of talent training, our country has newly built three specialized colleges in radio electronics, and dozens of colleges and universities have established departments or majors related to radio electronics. In the University of Science and Technology of China, newly established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences last year, the Department of Radio Electronics is one of the departments with the largest number of students. In the past year, the scientific research work of radio electronics in various colleges and universities has also been vigorously launched. In order to concentrate forces to solve major scientific problems, a new relationship of communist collaboration is being formed and developed between the various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, factories and research institutions in various industrial sectors, and colleges and universities.

In terms of the radio industry, since the founding of New China, a certain foundation has been gradually established from scratch, from small to large, providing favorable conditions for further development in the future. The total output value of my country's radio industry increased by more than six times during the first five-year plan. In 1958, the total output value of the national radio industry increased by 2.6 times compared with 1957, exceeding the total of the five-year output value of the first five-year plan. The number of electronic tubes produced in 1958 increased by nearly two times compared with 1957. The production of various radios increased by nearly four times in 1958 compared with 1957. In recent years, the production technology level of the radio industry has also been greatly improved. Television, radar, radio navigation equipment, high-power broadcast transmission equipment, ultra-high frequency electron tubes, electron beam tubes, transistors, and certain other advanced electronic instruments have been successfully developed and put into production. A total of 791 new product trial production projects were completed in 1958, equivalent to 6.6 times the five-year trial production projects of the first five-year plan. The total number of radio employees in the country in 1958 increased by more than half compared with 1957.

As for the development of radio communication and broadcasting, it can be said that it has become an important part of the cultural life of the Chinese people. Every province has a radio station, and listeners are all over the cities and countryside. Every commune has a radio. Many communes have connected radio broadcasts and wired broadcasts installed by the commune itself, becoming a powerful tool for publicizing the Party's policies, educating the people, disseminating cultural knowledge, exchanging production experience, and enriching cultural and entertainment life. In order to meet the growing needs of the people's cultural life, China's first television station has been established in the capital Beijing, and many large and medium-sized cities have also begun to prepare for the establishment of television stations.

The achievements my country has made in the radio electronics industry, scientific research, and education are inseparable from the fraternal assistance of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people. Here, our Chinese radio scientists would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people and the Soviet experts, professors, and scientific and technical workers—the successors of the great Russian scholar and inventor Alexander Stepanovich Popov.

Today, as we commemorate this genius inventor, our New China radio electronics workers must strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, study Alexander Stepanovich Popov's theories and writings, learn from his scientific work attitude of linking theory with practice, and learn from his noble character of loving the motherland and the people. We must resolutely implement the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," continue to emancipate our minds, break superstitions, strengthen scientific analysis, proceed from the tasks of socialist construction, realize the whole country as one game of chess, further mobilize the masses, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in China's radio electronics industry.

    纪念波波夫诞生一百周年加速发展无线电电子学事业
    中国科学院电子学研究所筹备委员会副主任　顾德欢
    今天，我们来纪念伟大的俄罗斯科学家、无线电发明者与近代无线电工学奠基者亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫诞生一百周年，有着非常重大的意义。最近，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会胜利地揭开了苏联全面建设共产主义的新的历史时期，大会号召苏联科学家们要在广泛采用物理学、无线电电子学等新成就的基础上为共产主义建设创造新的技术手段，要求在共产主义的思想教育工作中实现无线电化。我国人民正在掀起一个文化革命与技术革命的高潮，同样日益感到加速发展无线电电子学的重要性与迫切性。在这个时候，我们更深切的体会到亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫的科学创造事业的深远影响，而油然产生崇高的敬意。在这个时候，我们也不能不来回顾一下自波波夫发明无线电后几十年来无线电电子学的重大发展，展望一下无线电电子学在今后社会主义与共产主义建设事业中，在人类进一步征服自然与丰富自己的生活的斗争中将要发挥的日益巨大的作用。
      （一）
    自从波波夫为电磁波与电振荡的基本科学研究应用于人类生活实践开辟了一条新的道路以来，经苏联与全世界各国科学家几十年的努力，在近代生产力与各部门科学技术的不断发展与互相影响互相促进下面，无线电电子学已经发展成为一门在实际应用与科学理论上内容都非常广泛丰富的技术科学部门。
    在最近的十多年中，无线电电子学有了新的巨大的发展。电真空器件由于超高频电子器件的迅速发展而出现了新的局面，它们的功率日益增大，噪音日益缩小，灵敏度日益提高，可调的频带更宽，可用的波长更短（进入毫米波段）。半导体器件的发明，掀起了又一次无线电技术的革命，使许多无线电设备可以大大地缩小体积，减轻重量，减少电能消耗，因而使无线电技术能够进一步渗入许多工程技术部门。在最近几年内发展起来的电子计算机、信息论与控制论、低温物理学、固体物理学、量子放大器与参量放大器、核子物理学、等离子区研究、人造地球卫星与宇宙航行和新的合成材料以及新的制造工艺，使无线电电子学正面临着一次更加广泛而深远的技术革命，使无线电电子学正在进入一个新的更高更宽广的发展阶段。正如苏联科学院副院长托布切卡院士在“共产主义建设与科学”一文中所论述的，“我们的时代是原子能时代，但把它叫做无线电电子学时代亦是正确的，因为无线电电子学的方法现在已应用于所有的科学技术部门中”。
    以波波夫的伟大发明作为起点而发展起来的无线电电子学，今天具有怎样的面貌呢？这里想从无线电电子学实际应用的角度上简单谈谈它的几个主要方面的情况：
                    无线电通信与电视
    无线电通信虽然是无线电电子学最早的实际应用，但是它并没有失掉自己不断革新发展的生命力。由于对通信数量的要求增大，通信的距离要求越来越远，而自然和人为的干扰不断在增加，这些情况要求人们寻求具有高度可靠性的和高效率的同时又经济的新的通信方法。无线电接力系统在近几年有着很大的发展，已经有几个国家在进行1920路的通讯实验。现在的研究方向是降低天线间的干扰，增大通讯量，提高通讯质量。前向散射传播通讯具有无线电接力系统所没有的优点，即不受太阳活动的影响，不受地理条件的限制，可以跨过湖泊、海面、森林和高山而不需中间站，电离层散射传播在30—60兆赫波段上，已经获得二千公里的可靠通信，对流层散射传播利用公寸波已获得四百八十公里的可靠通讯，这方面的研究工作正向着提高发射机功率，提高接收机的灵敏度和稳定度以及高增益狭波瓣天线的方向发展。
    毫米波波导管远距离传输是正在开始研究的有着很大发展前途的新的通信方法，它具有宽的通频带，低衰耗，不受干扰等优良特性。实现这一方法还需要解决一系列理论上实验上和工艺上的问题，例如消除低次波的问题，不连续处引起的失真问题，毫米波低噪声放大问题，信号调制方法问题，小衰耗量测问题，波导管的加工和防腐问题等。但这一方法研究成功后，可以在一条小截面的圆波导内使用毫米波同时通过数万路电报电话或上百路电视节目，它将使通讯方法出现一次巨大的技术革命，因而现在苏联、美国、英国、日本等等国家都在这方面进行大量研究工作。
    电视已经有将近三十年的发展，它不仅可以把人们的视野延长数百公里，还可把高空和海底以及人类不能接近的地点（如有爆炸放射性和剧毒的环境）的景象显示在人们的前面。在工业生产上，电视和自动生产线配合，可以保证产品的质量并提高产量，帮助人们检查眼睛无法看到的过程和现象。军用电视可以帮助指挥员迅速而正确地了解情况，提高战斗效能。在文化生活中和教育事业中，电视的应用日益广泛。目前，电视正在不断改进它的分辨力和灵敏度，改进传输方法，降低设备的复杂程度和增加其可靠性，并努力使彩色电视可以实际广泛应用起来。
                      雷达——无线电测位术
    雷达是根据波波夫发现的电磁波可以被反射的现象，在第二次世界大战前夕研究创制成功的，在最近的十多年中它有很大的发展。雷达的发展，使无线电技术的应用，从通讯的领域扩大到导航、测量、天文、气象等许多方面，同时它对发射、接收、天线、显示、信据传递、脉冲技术、各种电子器件与元件等无线电电子学的基本工作，提出了越来越高的要求，大大促进了后者的进步。目前雷达正向着提高作用距离和提高分辨力的方向发展。美国正在研制三千哩的超远程雷达，可以显示三十公里内目标形状的毫米波雷达已经在几个国家制造出来。用于不同的民用与军事目的雷达的种类型号非常繁多，因而雷达的研究与制造在无线电电子学的科学研究与工业生产的数量中占了非常大的比重。
                      电子计算机
    电子计算机的出现是近代无线电电子学发展的新的高峰，是人类无穷无尽的创造才能的真正奇迹。近年来随着快速电子计算机与计算技术的加速发展，整个科学技术正在发生一种质的飞跃，国民经济各部门的许多分门别类的科学和技术都将受到深刻的影响，科学和技术将迅速地数学化，一切重大科学部门都将成为精密的学术部门。对于这一个空前深刻与巨大的技术革命及其可能产生的深远影响，我们必须要有充分的思想准备与组织准备。电子计算机今天已经广泛地为各方面服务。它可以迅速地进行大量的复杂的计算，帮助人们解决气体动力学、流体力学、气象学和原子核物理等等方面非常繁杂的数学计算。它可以帮助人们对复杂而精确的生产过程和快速动作的过程进行控制，它还可以进行科学资料的整理和统计，并进行文字翻译。目前电子计算机正向着高计算速度、高的可靠性以及更多的应用上发展。
                        无线电导航
    无线电导航是随着航空事业的发展而发展起来的。在日益频繁的空中交通中，和飞机速度愈来愈大的情况下，无线电导航也日益重要。已经有两种导航系统：超短波导航和长波双曲线导航系统。这些系统可以使飞机精确地确定自己的所在地，其误差仅数十公尺。需要进一步提高精确度并减轻飞机上导航设备的重量。现代的高速飞机上必须具有由原始信息感受器、计算机和自动驾驶仪组成的制导系统。自动雷达导航系统和惯性导航系统正随着飞机速度的提高而发展着。近年来由于原子能潜艇的制成，实现了水下的长距离航行，因而解决潜艇的导航问题成为迫切需要，大量的研究工作在这方面进行着。
    火箭技术、人造地球卫星与宇宙航行中的无线电技术
    苏联发射人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭的成功，揭开了宇宙航行的序幕，并向无线电电子学提出了许多新的任务。首先必须增加无线电的作用距离。根据有人简单的理论计算，如果使用波长为三公分，辐射脉冲功率为一兆瓦的通讯机，当收发天线的面积为一平方公尺，可获得一点三亿公里的通讯距离，在这样距离上信号的往返时间要十五分钟。显然这对无线电技术是个新课题。为了防止流星的撞击，由于可以伤害飞船的最小流星的有效反射面差不多只有零点零一平方公尺，并且具有每秒数十公里的相对速度，必须使用波长极短的雷达（例如四毫米）来发现它们。为了测量高速流星的轨迹，并迅速改变飞船的方向，还必须有由计算机控制的自动操舵装置。火箭技术对电子学器件与各种元件的抗振、耐高温、低温、超小型等性能的要求特别严格。各种科学研究的数据，只能用无线电技术来传到地面。因此，当今天许多力学工作者、发动机动力学工作者、高能燃料工作者、化学和冶金工作者在为火箭技术与实现宇宙航行而创造性地工作着时，无线电电子学工作者也必须为着同样的目的而进行不懈的努力。
              无线电电子学与原子能科学技术
    原子能科学技术的发展与加速器的发展是分不开的。可以这样说：没有无线电电子学在研制回旋加速器、直线电子加速器、同步稳相加速器和其他类型的加速器方面的配合，就不可能有今天原子能科学技术的成就。为了研究基本粒子的某些特性，毫微秒以至微微秒脉冲技术发展起来了。为了实现热核反应的人工控制，强电流脉冲放电的研究和等离子区的研究，在近几年有了极大的发展，这是一门从无线电电子学和原子能科学之间生长起来的边缘学科。许多无线电电子学工作者在这方面顽强地工作着，他们和原子能科学工作者一起为实现人类进一步解放与掌握大自然的伟大潜力而贡献着力量。苏联最近正在进行试验的“奥格拉”装置是这方面杰出的成就。当然，在原子能的科学研究与和平利用中，还需要许许多多量测用的、控制用的与其他各种各样的电子学仪器设备。无线电电子学工作者必须从多方面为直接间接配合原子能的工作而努力。
                      无线电频谱学
    最近十年来产生的这门新的无线电频谱学，是用无线电技术来研究处于气态、液态或固态的物质的种种特性的有力工具。它与理论物理学、电动力学、量子力学和群论有密切的联系。应用了无线电频谱学的方法观察到了氢原子S能级的位移并发现了电子的不正常的磁矩，这给予量子电动力学的发展以巨大的推动。应用这个方法来对分子结构进行研究，对化学键的理论有很大意义。这个方法可使混合气体（特别是稀有气体）的定量分析迅速而准确。利用这个方法测量原子核的核矩，使核子理论丰富了。分子钟是利用被气体吸收的窄谱线能使极高频振荡具有高稳定度的原理制成的，由此我们得到极为精确的频律标准。无线电频谱学的成就把极短的电磁波（次毫米）的产生和倍频的方法向前推进了一步。
                    无线电天文学
    无线电天文学在第二次世界大战后，由于利用了雷达上的高灵敏度接收机，天线和显示器因而得到很快的发展，目前已成为研究宇宙的最强有力的工具之一。它开辟了研究太阳及恒星结构、星际物质的组成和分布以及宇宙线的起源等基本问题的新途径。由于波长从一公分到二十公尺的电磁波能够穿透地球大气层而达到地面。射电天文观察在任何气候条件下，不论日夜都可进行，因而给人们打开了广阔的眼界。无线电天文观察和研究的主要对象是太阳、月球、银河系和总星系的射频辐射，它不仅发现了以前未发现的星座和星云，还可用于研究星际物质。无线电望远镜和无线电干涉仪是无线电天文站的主要工具，这两种工具正向着窄方向性、高的角度准确性以及高灵敏性发展，加大天线尺寸和采用信号积累以及低噪声放大等方法是发展的主要方向。
                      无线电气象学
    无线电气象学实际上是在六十四年前波波夫用自己的雷暴指示器记录了距离在三十公里远的闪电时诞生的。今天无线电气象学同时为无线电技术和气象学服务。气象学因素影响着无线电波的折射、散射和吸收作用，因而无线电气象学能估计对流层中气象因素对无线电波传播的影响。用无线电技术的方法可以帮助研究雨雪和云的形成以及对流层下层的不均匀性和湍流性。有多种多样的无线电仪器为气象学服务，如不需人管理可以自动测量各种水文气象因素的设备（包括风速、风向、气压、温度、湿度、大气沉积、水温度等），无线电探空仪、无线电风力计和气象雷达等。所有这些无线电方法的利用大大地丰富了气象学；此外，只有借助于电子计算机，今天才可以进行迅速而准确的气象预报，使人们能及时地防御和战胜自然灾害的侵袭。
                      超声波的应用
    超声波振动由于具有许多特点，因而有着广泛的应用。水是声波的良好导体，因而超声波在水中传播的现象首先被利用在潜艇的探测、联络和通讯上。回声测深仪可以探测海水的深度和海中的鱼群，成为捕鱼和海洋考察的有力工具之一。脉冲状态的超声波可以用来探测固体的不均匀性，因而超声探伤广泛地用于工业中，以改进产品质量并防止事故。超声波在液体中的空化作用可以产生巨大的压力和局部温升，这种现象可用来改善金属结构，对液体进行消毒，并用人工方法制成乳状液体，还可以清洗微小零件。超声波作用于某些化学物时可以使反应加快，也可控制反应的过程，如可以加速高分子化合物的聚合过程。超声波还可以用于焊接铝与不锈钢并在上面镀锡，还可以在脆硬的材料（如玻璃）上凿孔而不损坏材料。在医疗方面，超声波已开始用来治疗某种神经痛，并探测癌和瘤的早期症状等等。由于超声波的应用日益广泛，因而如何把电振荡转换为声波，声波在不同媒质中的传播，以及把声波转换为电振荡的问题，已是电子学的一个重要课题。
    既然无线电电子学的方法，各种电子学的仪器设备，已经应用于几乎所有的科学技术部门中，我们不可能一一列举完全。如像电子显微镜这样重要的科学研究工具，在上面还没有提到。而自动技术与遥控技术这样一门综合性的技术科学，在很大程度上是以无线电电子学的成就为基础的。我们可以说，今天应用电子学仪器设备的水平，已成为衡量某一生产部门与科学技术部门的发展状况的重要尺度之一。
    但是我们决不能造成一种错觉，以为无线电电子学只是一门应用的与实验性的科学。正相反，无线电电子学是一门以巩固的理论为基础的科学。随着无线电电子学应用范围的日益广泛发展，它本身的基本研究与理论研究的任务也更加繁重了。建立在最先进的理论基础上的理论无线电电子学，由于采用了强有力的电子计算机和数学及理论物理学的成果，特别是经典电动力学、量子电动力学、统计物理学、固体物理学、原子核物理学和力学的方法与成果，正在不断地发展着，它用深入的分析和广泛的总结，不断地吸收着各兄弟学科的有用的养料，来丰富自己，并不断地为试验工作、工程设计和生产技术奠定着巩固的基础。
                  （二）
    谈到我国的情况，我们可以说，在旧中国，由于帝国主义的掠夺与国民党反动统治窒息科学事业的结果，使我国无线电电子学事业长期处于极端落后状态。那时，邮电通信和广播也并不发达，只有为数很少的、电力不大的无线电台和广播电台。全国没有一个高等学校设有独立的无线电学系，只有极少的高等学校里有无线电课程。没有一个自己制造无线电设备的工厂，而所有的无线电设备几乎完全依赖从国外进口。没有一个无线电的专门研究机构，只有少数科学工作者从事一些零星的收效不大的研究工作。
    在新中国成立以后，党和政府就十分重视和关怀无线电电子学事业的发展。在1956年制订的我国科学技术发展的十二年远景规划中，对无线电电子学的发展方向、研究计划、研究机构设置、工业生产、干部培养等等重要方面都作了具体的安排。1958年我国社会主义建设的全面大跃进，又促进了我国无线电电子学事业的进一步发展，使十二年远景规划有可能提早实现。1956年冬，中国科学院开始筹建无线电电子学、自动化、计算技术、半导体等有关尖端技术的专门研究机关，经过两年来的努力，已开始实际研究工作。邮电广播部门、工业部门及其他产业部门都建立了若干个专业性研究机构，并做出了一定的成绩。1958年9月，中国科学院召集了一次有关无线电电子学科学研究工作的全国性会议以后，许多省开始筹建有关无线电电子学的地方性研究机构。
    在培养人材方面，我国已新建三所无线电电子学方面的专门学院，几十所高等学校内设立了有关无线电电子学的系或专业。中国科学院去年新办的中国科学技术大学内，无线电电子学系是学生人数最多的系之一。近一年来，各高等学校，无线电电子学的科学研究工作也已蓬勃地开展起来。为了集中力量解决重大的科学问题，在中国科学院各研究所、各产业部门的工厂与研究机构及高等学校之间，一种共产主义大协作的新关系，正在形成与发展起来。
    在无线电工业方面，新中国成立以来，已从无到有、从小到大逐步建立了一定的基础，为今后进一步发展提供了有利的条件。我国无线电工业的生产总值，第一个五年计划内，共增长了六倍多。1958年全国无线电工业总产值比1957年增长二点六倍，超过第一个五年计划五年产值的总和。1958年生产的电子管个数比1957年增加了近二倍。各种收音机的生产量1958年比1957年增加了将近四倍。几年来无线电工业的生产技术水平也有了很大的提高。电视、雷达、无线电导航设备、大功率广播发射设备、超高频电子管、电子束管、晶体管及其它某些高级电子仪器已研制成功，并投入生产。1958年共完成新产品试制项目七百九十一项，相当于第一个五年计划五年试制项目的六点六倍。1958年全国无线电职工总数比1957年增加了一倍半多。
    至于无线电通讯与广播事业的发展，可以说已成为我国人民文化生活的重要组成部分。各省都有广播电台，听众遍及城乡，每个公社都有收音机。许多公社已经把无线电广播和社里自己安置的有线广播连接起来，成为宣传党的方针和政策、教育人民、传播文化知识、交流生产经验和丰富文化娱乐生活的有力工具。为了满足人民文化生活日益增长的需要，在首都北京已建立了我国第一座电视台，许多大中城市也开始筹建电视台的工作。
    我国在无线电电子学工业、科学研究及教育事业方面取得的成就，都是与伟大的苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民兄弟般的援助分不开的。在这里，我们中国的无线电科学工作者，谨向苏联人民以及苏联的专家、教授、科学技术工作者——俄罗斯伟大学者和发明家亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫的继承者表示衷心的谢意。
    今天，当我们纪念这位天才的发明家的时候，我们新中国的无线电子学工作者一定要努力学习苏联的先进经验，学习亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫的理论和著作，学习他理论联系实际的科学工作态度，学习他热爱祖国、热爱人民的崇高品格。我们一定要坚决贯彻党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线，继续解放思想，破除迷信，加强科学分析，从社会主义建设任务出发，实现全国一盘棋，进一步发动群众，为我国的无线电电子学事业获得更大、更好、更全面的跃进而努力。
