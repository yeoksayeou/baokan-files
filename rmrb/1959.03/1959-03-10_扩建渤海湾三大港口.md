Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Extensive expansion projects at the three major ports of Bohai Bay—Tianjin New Port, Qinhuangdao Port, and Dalian Port—have recently commenced or are entering the stage of construction preparation.
    Tianjin New Port will be expanded this year with a deep-water wharf capable of simultaneously accommodating five 10,000-ton freighters. Giant "portal" cranes will be installed on the wharf, and dedicated railway lines will be laid, allowing ships and trains to directly transport goods. The expansion project began construction in February. Upon completion of this project, the cargo throughput capacity of Tianjin New Port will nearly double.
    The first phase of the recently commenced Qinhuangdao Port expansion project includes two berths equipped with mechanized equipment. Upon completion, it will be able to simultaneously accommodate two freighters ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 tons, increasing the loading and unloading capacity by more than two times.
    Dalian Port's focus this year is on expanding mechanized loading and unloading equipment to improve loading and unloading efficiency.
    The expansion of these three ports is being undertaken to accommodate the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the increasing volume of cargo throughput.

    扩建渤海湾三大港口
    据新华社讯　渤海湾三大港口——天津新港、秦皇岛港和大连港宏伟的扩建工程最近已经开工或进入施工准备阶段。
    天津新港今年要扩建一个同时能停靠五艘万吨巨轮的深水码头；码头上将安装巨型“门式”起重设备、铺设铁路专用线，轮船、火车可以直接运载货物。扩建工程已经在2月份开始动工。这项工程全部完工以后，天津新港的货物吞吐能力将增加近一倍。
    最近开工的秦皇岛港第一期扩建工程，包括两个泊位的、具有机械化装备的码头，建成后可以同时停靠一万吨到一万五千吨的巨轮两艘，装卸能力将增加两倍多。
    大连港今年主要是扩建机械化的装卸设备，以提高装卸效率。
    这三个港口是为适应工农业生产的更大跃进、货物吞吐量日益增长而进行扩建的。
