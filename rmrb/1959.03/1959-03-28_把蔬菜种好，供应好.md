    Grow and Supply Vegetables Well
    People's Daily Commentator
    Growing and supplying vegetables well is a very important issue for further improving people's lives. All relevant departments and people's communes should pay serious attention to this matter.

    This year, China's vegetable planting area will expand by about 50% compared to last year. Many provinces and cities, including Henan, Hunan, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Beijing, and Shanghai, have successively convened vegetable conferences based on the principles of "local production, local supply, designated responsibility areas, guaranteeing self-sufficiency, and providing support to other areas when necessary," comprehensively arranging vegetable production and supply work. Some provinces and cities have also established vegetable production offices or headquarters under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with agriculture and commerce departments working together. Vegetable production and supply work have been further strengthened.

    However, after the rural communization and the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, with the great leap forward in industry, the number of cities, industrial and mining areas has increased, and the demand for vegetables has also increased; in rural areas, due to the communal dining halls, the number of vegetables that need to be supplied centrally is even greater. This puts forward the task of developing vegetable production faster and better for the people's communes in urban suburbs and vast rural areas. In order to ensure the realization of this year's production plan and to meet people's needs for vegetable supply relatively evenly, two more problems should be solved in a timely manner: properly arrange the labor force for vegetable production and gradually achieve vegetable specialization; make full use of processing and storage to solve the contradiction between the off-season and peak season, and achieve balanced supply during the off-season and peak season.

    Vegetables are a kind of horticultural crop, and vegetable production requires certain techniques. Therefore, to ensure that this year's vegetable production completes the plan in quantity, on time, and in variety, the primary key is to arrange the labor force required for vegetable production well, and correspondingly ensure the specialization of the technical force for vegetable production. After liberation, the suburbs of several cities and industrial and mining areas had agricultural production cooperatives specializing in vegetable production. Taking Beijing as an example, in 1957 there were about fifty vegetable production cooperatives. These cooperatives had fixed land and labor force, specializing in vegetable production. This practice has played a good role in ensuring the supply of the city, and is of great significance for studying technology, improving production management, and increasing varieties.

    In terms of labor arrangement, the first thing to do is to specialize technical personnel. There are two situations here: one is the people's communes in the suburbs of cities and industrial and mining areas, they should fix the technical personnel necessary for the national vegetable planting plan and specialize in vegetable production. Some cities have proposed the method of returning old vegetable farmers to the team is necessary, which can not only strengthen field management and increase vegetable production, but also help to continuously cultivate new forces. One is the vast rural people's communes, they should delineate a certain amount of land and equip necessary labor force for vegetable production according to the principle of simultaneously focusing on self-sufficiency production and commodity production, in order to gradually improve technology.

    Some people think: At present, the labor force is relatively tight, will emphasizing the specialization of vegetable production technicians cause waste of labor? We believe that this issue should be viewed dialectically. It is precisely because the labor force is tight, and vegetable production is relatively labor-intensive and has certain technicality, the specialization of technical personnel is even more necessary, and it can save labor. By doing this, first, we can strengthen regular field management and prevent and control diseases and insect pests in a timely manner, which can avoid concentrating labor force to carry out shock work in a certain period of time; second, we can be proficient and improve technology, increase labor productivity, thereby greatly saving manpower. If no one is in charge, resulting in extensive field management, affecting the yield and quality of vegetables, this is the biggest waste.

    Vegetable production has a strong seasonality, but people's consumption of vegetables is frequent. This forms a contradiction in vegetable production and supply. There are two ways to solve this contradiction: one is to strive to improve technology in production, and gradually narrow the contradiction by staggering sowing and bringing forward or postponing the time of market; the other is to make full use of processing and storage methods to regulate the contradiction between the off-season and peak season, so as to supplement the off-season with the peak season and connect the off-season and peak season. To achieve this, it is necessary to implement the two-pronged approach of simultaneously focusing on self-sufficiency production and commodity production. Collective canteens of factories, schools, government agencies, people's communes in the suburbs mainly producing vegetables and operating departments, collective canteens of communes, and the vast consumers, should all process and store a certain amount of vegetables in the peak season. There are many rich experiences in processing and storing vegetables in our folk, and using these experiences can better regulate the contradiction between the off-season and peak season.

    把蔬菜种好，供应好
    本报评论员
    把蔬菜种好、供应好是进一步改善人民生活的一个很重要的问题，各有关部门和人民公社应该把这件事情认真地重视起来。
    今年我国的蔬菜播种面积将比去年扩大50％左右。河南、湖南、陕西、黑龙江、北京、上海等许多省市都根据“就地生产，就地供应，划片包干，保证自给，必要时还能支援外地”的方针，先后召开了蔬菜会议，全面安排了蔬菜的生产和供应工作。有些省市还在党委统一领导下，建立蔬菜生产办公室或指挥部，农业和商业部门共同协作，蔬菜生产和供应工作都进一步加强了。
    但是，农村公社化和工农业生产出现更大的跃进以后，随着工业大跃进，城市、工矿区增多了，对蔬菜的需要量也增多了；在农村中由于吃饭食堂化，需要集中供应蔬菜的数量更大。这就给城市郊区和广大农村的人民公社提出了更多更快地发展蔬菜生产的任务。为了保证今年生产计划的实现，使蔬菜供应比较均衡地满足人们的需要，还应该及时地进一步解决两个问题：妥善安排生产蔬菜的劳动力，逐步达到种菜专业化；充分利用加工贮存解决淡季旺季的矛盾，做到淡季旺季衔接均衡供应。
    蔬菜是一种园艺作物，生产蔬菜需要一定的技术。因此，要保证今年的蔬菜生产按量、按期、按品种地完成计划，首要的关键是很好地安排蔬菜生产所需劳动力，相应地保证生产蔬菜的技术力量专业化。解放后，若干城市和工矿区的郊区曾有着专门生产蔬菜的农业生产合作社。以北京为例，1957年就有五十个左右的蔬菜生产社。这些合作社有固定的土地和劳动力，专门经营蔬菜生产。这种作法对保证城市的供应起了良好的作用，对钻研技术、改进生产管理、增加品种等方面都有重要的意义。
    在劳力安排上，首先应该使技术人员专业化。这里有两种情况：一种是城市和工矿区郊区的人民公社，他们应该按照国家关于蔬菜播种计划所必需的技术人员固定起来，专门从事蔬菜生产。有些城市提出老菜农归队的办法是必要的，这不仅可以加强田间管理工作，提高蔬菜生产量，还有利于不断地培养新生力量。一种是广大农村人民公社，他们应根据自给性生产与商品性生产同时并举的方针，划定一定的土地，配备必要的劳动力，进行蔬菜生产，以便逐步提高技术。
    有人认为：目前劳动力比较紧张，强调蔬菜生产技术人员专业化会不会造成劳力浪费呢？我们认为应该辩证地看待这个问题。正是由于劳力紧张，而蔬菜生产比较费工，又有一定的技术性，技术人员专业化才更是需要的，才更能够节省劳动力。这样作，一可以加强经常的田间管理，及时防治病虫害，这就可以避免了集中劳动力在一定时期内搞突击；二可以熟练和提高技术，提高劳动生产率，从而大大节省人力。如果没有专人负责，形成田间管理粗放，影响蔬菜的产量和质量，这才是最大的浪费。
    蔬菜生产有较强的季节性，但人们对蔬菜的消费却是经常的。这就形成了蔬菜生产和供应中的矛盾。解决这个矛盾有两个办法：一个是生产上努力提高技术，通过排开播种、提早或错后上市时间等办法，逐步缩小矛盾；一个是充分利用加工和贮存的办法来调节淡季和旺季的矛盾，做到以旺补淡，淡旺衔接。要做到这一点，就要贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的两条腿走路的方针。工厂、学校、机关团体的集体食堂，郊区生产蔬菜为主的人民公社和经营部门，公社的集体食堂以及广大的消费者，都应该在旺季加工和贮存一定数量的蔬菜。我国民间有许多丰富的加工贮存蔬菜的经验，利用这些经验，就可以更好地调节淡旺季的矛盾。
