Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 28th: From February 18th to 25th, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region held a conference of advanced units and advanced producer representatives in industry and transportation in Urumqi. The 775 representatives attending the meeting proposed to the 200,000 workers of all ethnic groups on the industrial and transportation front of the region: Exert full effort, immediately launch a greater leap forward in production, and complete this year's production plan by season, month, and day.

During the meeting, Saifuddin, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, spoke at the meeting. Zeng Di, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, reported on the achievements of the autonomous region's industrial and transportation front in 1958 and this year's basic tasks.

The representatives of all ethnic groups who attended the conference unanimously believed that with the foundation and experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Xinjiang's leap forward plan for industry and transportation this year can be fully realized. The meeting demanded that workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously carry out technological revolution, continuously improve equipment utilization, reduce production costs, and launch a high-quota, high-yield, high-quality, high-record emulation campaign on the industrial and transportation front to complete production plans by season, month, and day.

The meeting adopted a combination of in-conference and out-of-conference methods, broadcasting the main activities of the conference to various factories and mines north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Workers in various factories and mines reported good news to the conference with practical actions to launch a production upsurge. On the last day of the meeting, a region-wide radio mobilization rally was also held. From miners in the Altai Mountains to silk reeling workers at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, from steel workers on the banks of the Toutun River and in the valleys of the Tianshan Mountains to oil workers in Karamay, they responded to the conference's proposal. The workers of the metallurgical industry system proposed: Exert soaring energy, seize the time, strive for the top, and strive for a year to achieve a complete red success in monthly and seasonal production plans. The workers of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration proposed: Strive to complete the annual drilling and oil production plan one quarter ahead of schedule. Coal workers expressed that they must achieve the production increase plan for raw coal and coking coal to ensure the leap forward of the steel industry. The workers of the July 1 Cotton Textile Factory sent to the conference a letter of determination signed by more than 8,000 workers.
