Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 29th: Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, a nationally renowned high-yield rice county, is vigorously and practically grasping early rice sowing and seedling cultivation to strive for a bumper early rice harvest this year. As of now, about half of the county's more than 70,000 mu of early rice seedling fields have completed sowing, and the communes are vigorously strengthening their management. The remaining seedling fields have generally been prepared and will be sown in concentrated bursts in the next few days. To welcome early rice transplanting, the plowing of early rice fields and the application of base fertilizer are also being carried out on a large scale.

Last year, Xiaogan County achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of early rice. The average yield per mu in this season alone was much higher than the average yield per mu of both early and late rice in the previous year, thus winning the title of Hubei Province's champion in large-scale high-yield early rice production. This year, based on summarizing last year's successful experiences, the county decided to make an even greater leap forward in early rice production to maintain the title of high-yield champion. At the same time, it was decided that grasping sowing and seedling cultivation would be the primary key to achieving a bumper early rice harvest. To this end, Party organizations at all levels from the county to the production team formulated specific measures related to sowing and seedling cultivation as early as possible, and mobilized cadres and commune members to conscientiously organize their implementation. Because of the importance attached to the key of early rice sowing and seedling cultivation from top to bottom, and the implementation of early and vigorous grasping, the various tasks related to sowing and seedling cultivation were carried out very well. The county's more than 70,000 mu of early rice seedling fields were cultivated two to three times in some cases, and four to five times in others. Generally, they achieved "fields as smooth as mirrors, mud as thick as soup, properly opened ridges, and weeds removed," and the amount of fertilizer applied was generally doubled compared to last year. The sowing period for seedling fields was generally seven to ten days earlier than last year, and the amount of seeds sown per mu was more than doubled compared to last year. In terms of seed treatment, all communes, in accordance with the requirements of the county Party committee, selected early rice varieties such as Nantao No. 1, Hongjiaozao, and Aomori No. 5, and conscientiously implemented a series of measures such as seed drying and seed soaking. They promoted soil greenhouse germination and seedling cultivation in moist seedling fields, and made preparations for frost prevention as early as possible.

Of the 300,000 mu of fields planned for early rice planting in the county, except for a portion planted with spring-harvested crops, they have generally been plowed and harrowed more than twice, with the plowing layer generally reaching a depth of about eight inches, and some reaching a depth of about one foot. In order to adapt to the further implementation of close planting, the preparation of early rice base fertilizer in the county is far more sufficient than last year, and many places have already applied hundreds to nearly a thousand dan per mu.

    田平如镜　泥烂如羹
    孝感大抓早插育秧工作
    本报武汉29日电　全国著名的水稻高产县——湖北省孝感县正轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的大抓早稻播种、育秧工作，为力争今年早稻大丰收而战。截至目前为止，全县七万多亩早稻秧田完成播种工作的已达一半左右，各公社正大力对它们加强管理；其余的秧田一般都已整好，最近几天内将陆续突击播种。为迎接早稻插秧，早稻田的耕翻和增施底肥的工作也正在大规模地进行着。
    去年孝感县的早稻曾获得空前未有的大面积丰收，仅这一季的平均亩产量就比前年早、晚两季水稻的平均亩产量还高得多，因而获得了湖北省早稻大面积高产冠军的称号。今年，在总结去年成功经验的基础上，这个县决定使早稻生产再来一个更大的跃进，以保持高产冠军的称号；同时，还决定把抓好播种、育秧作为取得早稻大丰收的首要关键。为此，从县到生产队的各级党组织都及早地订出了有关播种、育秧的具体措施，发动干部和社员群众切实地组织贯彻。由于从上到下都重视了早稻播种、育秧这一关键，实行了早抓、狠抓的结果，有关播种、育秧的各项工作都作得很出色。全县七万多亩早稻秧田少的整了二次到三次，多的整了四次到五次，一般都作到了“田平如镜、泥烂如羹、厢沟开正、杂草除尽”，而且施肥量普遍比去年增加了一倍左右。秧田播种期一般都比去年提早了七天到十天，每亩下种量比去年增加一倍以上。在种子处理方面，各公社都根据县委的要求，全部选用了南特号、红脚早、青森五号等早稻良种，并且认真地贯彻了晒种、浸种等一系列的措施，推行了土温室催芽和用湿润秧田育秧等办法。并且及早地作好了防冻准备工作。
    全县计划种植早稻的三十万亩田，除一部分种有春收作物的以外，一般都已经耕、耙二次以上，耕层普遍深达八寸左右，有一部分深达一尺左右。为适应进一步推行密植的需要，全县早稻底肥准备得远比去年充足，许多地方每亩已经施下几百担到近千担。
