    Power Machinery for Irrigation and Drainage

    The power machines used for irrigation and drainage in rural areas include gas engines, diesel engines, steam engines, gasoline engines, and electric motors.

    Gas engines use firewood, charcoal, anthracite, and bituminous coal as fuel. Natural gas can also be used directly as fuel. A ten-horsepower gas engine can drive a waterwheel to irrigate one hundred mu of land per day.

    Diesel engines use diesel as fuel. In addition to being used as power for irrigation and drainage, diesel engines are also commonly used in automobiles, tractors, road construction machinery, and mining machinery.

    Gasoline engines use gasoline as fuel, which is more expensive.

    The fuel for steam engines can be obtained locally, including coal, firewood, straw, heavy oil, or natural gas. The fuel cost is low, and repair and maintenance are relatively simple, but its disadvantage is its bulky size.

    Electric motors are generally called motors and can be used wherever there is a power source. It is the best type of power machine, economical, convenient, and efficient.

    排灌动力机械
    农村排灌用的动力机有煤气机、柴油机、锅驼机、汽油机和电动机等。
    煤气机用木柴、木炭、无烟煤、烟煤做燃料。也可以直接用天然煤气做燃料。一部十马力的煤气机，带动水车每天可以浇地一百亩。
    柴油机用柴油做燃料。除了用作排灌动力以外，汽车、拖拉机、筑路机械、矿山机械等也常采用柴油机。
    汽油机用汽油做燃料，费用较高。
    锅驼机（蒸汽机）的燃料可以就地取材，煤、木柴、秸秆、重油或天然气都可用。燃料费用低，修理维护也较简单，但体积笨重是它的缺点。
    电动机一般称作马达，凡有电源的地方都可以使用。它是最好的一种动力机，经济，方便，效率也高。
