    A rally was held in the capital this afternoon by the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity to celebrate the second anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Ghana and to welcome Mr. Gamaliel Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the All-African People’s Conference Preparatory Committee and editorial advisor of the Ghanaian magazine "Pan-Africa Century," and Mr. Moses Faircloth, publisher of "Pan-Africa Century," on their visit to our country.
    The famous American black scholar Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois was also invited to attend the rally.
    Mao Dun, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, said in his welcoming speech that we are very happy to gather today, on the anniversary of Ghana’s independence, to welcome friends from Ghana. He said that Ghana’s independence is a major victory for the African people in their struggle for national independence and freedom. In recent years, the African people’s movement against imperialism and for national independence and safeguarding has developed unprecedentedly vigorously and has continuously achieved new victories. It can be asserted that the days are not far off when the people of African countries will be liberated from imperialist enslavement and the imperialists will get out of Africa.
    Mao Dun said that the Chinese people express great sympathy and support for the struggle of the African people for independence and freedom. We believe that the people of African countries must gain independence, imperialism and colonialism must get out of Africa, and the African people should stand up and decide their own destiny.
    Mao Dun concluded by wishing that the friendship between the Chinese people and the Ghanaian people and the people of African countries will grow day by day.
    Mr. Annan began his speech by happily singing a Ghanaian folk song to everyone, the lyrics of which were: "Victory is ours, victory is ours, in the struggle of the African people, victory is ours." Then he said that as I speak to you here, in the cities, villages, and every corner of Ghana, everyone is cheering and celebrating Ghana’s Independence Day.
    He said that as we commemorate this Independence Day, we think of our brothers and sisters who are still toiling under the yoke of imperialism on the vast majority of African soil. They must be free, freedom is their right. Therefore, every effort must be made to liberate them from imperialism and colonialism.
    Annan then introduced the achievements Ghana has made in various construction undertakings in the two years since its independence. He said that during the colonial rule, Ghana was completely plundered of all rights to good welfare, education, culture, economy, and health facilities. Today, all this is changing. Roads that were once nominal are now first-class highways, city streets have been widened, and roads have been built in the most remote areas. Before independence, Ghana was very short of water, and at present many rural areas and villages have obtained a good water supply. Ghana's education has also developed in all aspects. Thousands of primary schools, high schools, colleges, and other educational institutions have been established. Cities, rural areas, and villages that could not enjoy these measures in the era of imperialism and colonialism can enjoy them today after independence and freedom.
    Annan said that all this illustrates what an independent country can achieve. He pointed out, however, that the world is going through a tense stage again because imperialist countries are greedily stockpiling weapons that lead to death and destruction, and they are stirring up trouble all over the world. He said that riots have occurred in many areas under imperialist and colonial rule, and the reason for these riots is that they do not recognize the right of the people in these areas to live as human beings, as masters of their own destiny.
    Annan concluded passionately that imperialism and colonialism are a pair of abominable twins. They must be completely and once and for all eliminated from the earth. Otherwise, the world will not be able to obtain peace and tranquility. Let all peace-loving people in the world stand up as one and wage a merciless struggle against the elements that undermine world security.
    Mr. Faircloth also spoke at the meeting, saying that the recent events in African colonies, such as the anti-imperialist struggles in the Belgian Congo, Nyasaland, and Southern Rhodesia, and the collapse of imperialist rule over the Algerian people, all show that imperialism is coming to an end.
    Faircloth said, how much longer can imperialism last? Certainly, no one can rule another for a long time. Whether imperialism likes it or not, just as day will come with night, the people of the whole world must be liberated from imperialist and colonial oppression.
    Dr. Du Bois was also invited to give an enthusiastic speech at the meeting. He said that he is an American, but his ancestors were African. He has been to Africa, but not to Ghana. Today, meeting Ghanaian friends in New China is a very meaningful thing.
    Dr. Du Bois wished the Ghanaian people happiness and prosperity. He concluded by shouting: "Long live Africa!"
    Today, more than 1,000 people from all walks of life, including Li Dequan, Ding Xilin, Hu Yuzhi, and Zhang Zhiran, attended the rally.

    首都欢迎加纳朋友集会上宾主同声指出
    帝国主义必须滚出非洲
    新华社6日讯　今天是加纳共和国独立两周年纪念日，中国亚非团结委员会在今天下午举行演讲会，欢迎全非人民大会筹备委员会秘书长、加纳“泛非世纪”杂志，编辑顾问加米苏·可非·阿麦格倍和“泛非世纪”杂志发行人摩西·费尔却艾尔特·哥霍霍来我国访问。
    美国著名黑人学者杜波伊斯博士也应邀出席了演讲会。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席茅盾在欢迎词中说，我们非常高兴在加纳独立纪念日的今天，集会欢迎来自加纳的朋友。他说，加纳的独立是非洲人民争取民族独立和自由斗争的重大胜利。近几年来，非洲人民反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的运动有了空前蓬勃的发展，并且不断取得新的胜利。可以断言，非洲各国人民从帝国主义的奴役下解放出来和帝国主义者滚出非洲的日子已经不远了。
    茅盾说，中国人民对非洲各国人民争取独立和自由的斗争表示极大的同情和支持。我们认为，非洲各国人民必须获得独立，帝国主义、殖民主义必须滚出非洲，非洲人民应该站起来决定自己的命运。
    茅盾最后祝中国人民和加纳人民、非洲各国人民的友谊日益发展。
    阿麦格倍先生在讲话开始时，愉快地向大家唱了一首加纳民歌，歌词是这样的：“胜利是我们的，胜利是我们的，在非洲人民的斗争中，胜利是我们的。”然后他讲话说，当我在这里向你们讲话的时候，在加纳的城市、村庄以及每一个角落，到处都在欢呼和庆祝加纳的独立日。
    他说，在我们纪念这个独立日时，我们想到在非洲绝大部分的土地上，还在帝国主义枷锁下做着苦役的我们的兄弟姐妹们。他们必须获得自由，自由是他们的权利。因此，必须竭尽一切努力，从帝国主义和殖民主义下解放出来。
    阿麦格倍接着介绍了加纳独立两年来在各项建设事业中所取得的成就。他说，在殖民统治时期，加纳完全被掠夺了一切良好福利、教育、文化、经济和卫生设施的权利。今天，这一切都在变化，曾经一度是有名无实的公路现在已成为头等的大干线公路，城市的街道扩大了，在最偏僻的地方也建设了公路。独立前，加纳很缺乏水，而目前许多农村和村庄都得了良好的水的供应。加纳教育事业也已经在各个方面发展起来。成千上万的小学、高等学校、学院以及其他教育机构已建立。在帝国主义及殖民主义时代无法享受这些措施的城市、农村和村庄，都能够在独立和自由以后的今天得到这些享受。
  阿麦格倍说，这一切都说明了一个独立了的国家能得到些什么。他指出，但是由于帝国主义国家贪馋地储存导致死亡和毁灭的武器，世界又在经历着紧张的阶段，他们正在世界各处惹事生非。他说，在帝国主义和殖民主义统治的许多地区发生了暴动，这些暴动的原因，都是因为他们不承认这些地区人民作为人类、作为自己命运的主人而生活的权利。
    阿麦格倍最后激昂地说，帝国主义同殖民主义是一对可恶的孪生兄弟。一定要彻底地、一劳永逸地将他们从地球上消灭掉。不然，世界就得不到安宁与和平。让世界上所有爱好和平的人们都像一个人一样地站起来，向破坏世界安全的分子进行无情的斗争。
    哥霍霍先生也在会上讲话，他说，最近在非洲殖民地所发生的事件，例如比属刚果、尼亚萨兰和南罗得西亚的反帝斗争，以及帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民的统治崩溃瓦解，这一切都说明帝国主义快要完蛋了。
    哥霍霍说，帝国主义还能维持多长？肯定地说，没有一个人能对另一个人长时期进行统治，不管帝国主义愿意与否，就像白天将随着黑夜来临一样，全世界人民一定要从帝国主义和殖民主义压迫下解放出来。
    杜波伊斯博士也应邀在会上作了热情的讲话。他说他是一个美国人，但是他的祖先是非洲。他到过非洲，但是没有到加纳。今天在新中国和加纳朋友会见是一件很有意义的事情。
    杜波伊斯博士祝加纳人民幸福和繁荣。他最后高呼：“非洲万岁！”
    今天，参加这个演讲会的，有李德全、丁西林、胡愈之、张志让等各界人士一千多人。
