To Rapidly Expand the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan-Zhangjiakou Power Grid
Beijing Electric Power Bureau Holds Meeting to Formulate Production and Construction Measures

    (Our Newspaper) The Beijing Electric Power Administration Bureau held a production and capital construction conference of the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou power grids from February 8th to 25th, and formulated measures to complete this year's production and construction tasks.
    This year's power generation plan for the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou power grids is 70% higher than last year. In terms of capital construction, it is planned to install more than 360,000 kilowatts of new power generation equipment this year, more than double that of last year. The meeting believes that in order to complete the task of doubling capital construction, under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the following four issues need to be resolved: First, seize the construction of civil engineering projects and strive for civil engineering to take the lead, so as to create conditions for the installation of power generation equipment and early power generation. The factory buildings of the four key projects of Tangshan Power Plant, Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant, Chengde Power Plant, and Xiahuayuan Power Plant will strive to have the roofs covered in the first quarter, so that power generation equipment can be installed and generate electricity as soon as possible. Second, vigorously promote rapid construction methods, promote the experience of cross-operation of civil engineering and installation, and pre-installation, pre-inspection, and pre-testing of equipment and materials, and implement three-shift or four-shift operations to improve the utilization rate of machinery. In the installation procedure of equipment, a unified arrangement will be made for the power grid as early as possible based on the arrival of the equipment. Third, improve engineering quality and resolutely eliminate "seven leaks" (air, water, steam, coal, oil, ash, gas). For projects that have been completed, the masses should be organized and mobilized to conduct inspections, and projects with poor quality should be remedied in a timely manner. Fourth, do a full and meticulous job of construction preparation and reduce project costs. At the same time, it is necessary to actively and proactively solve the problems existing in the supply of equipment and materials, and overcome the mentality of dependence and waiting. We must find out the specifications and quantities and the materials that are lacking. We must obtain materials locally. While ensuring the quality of the project, we must manufacture what can be manufactured and substitute what can be substituted.
    In terms of production, it is necessary to vigorously carry out mass movements and adhere to the policy of safe production. The meeting believes that this year, in addition to the mass safety inspection carried out before the Spring Festival, three more mass safety inspections should be launched before the warm and windy spring, the rainy and thundery summer, and the peak winter electricity consumption to eliminate and prevent various accidents. The meeting decided that it is necessary to seize the opportunity of relatively light electricity load in the first quarter of this year, concentrate efforts to basically complete the annual equipment overhaul tasks, and lay a good foundation for the annual safe production. The meeting also believes that this year, all plants should continue to actively tap the potential of power generation equipment and improve power generation capacity in accordance with specific conditions.

    迅速扩充京津唐张电网
    北京电业局开会制定生产和建设措施
    本报讯　北京电业管理局2月8日到25日召开了京、津、唐、张电网生产和基本建设会议，制定了完成今年生产和建设任务的措施。
    今年京、津、唐、张电网的发电量计划比去年增加70％，基本建设方面今年计划新安装三十六万多瓩发电设备，比去年增加一倍多。会议认为，为了完成基本建设翻一番的任务，在多快好省的方针指导下，需要解决以下四个问题：第一、抓紧土建工程，力争土建先行，为安装发电设备和提前发电创造条件，唐山发电厂、天津发电一厂、承德电厂、下花园电厂这四项重点工程的厂房，将争取在第一季度内把房顶盖好，以便发电设备早日安装，早日发电。第二、大力推行快速施工法，推广土建和安装交叉作业和设备器材的预安装、预检修、预试验等经验，实行三班或四班作业，以提高机械利用率。在安装设备的程序上，根据设备到货的情况，以早为发电网进行统一安排。第三、提高工程质量，坚决消灭“七漏”（漏风、水、汽、煤、油、灰、气）。对已经完工的工程，应组织和发动群众进行检查，发现质量不好的工程要及时进行补救。第四、充分细致地做好施工准备工作，降低工程造价。同时要积极主动地解决设备材料供应上存在的问题，克服依赖等待思想。要摸清规格数量，所缺材料，要就地取材，在保证工程质量的情况下，能制就制，能代就代。
    在生产方面，要大搞群众运动，坚持贯彻执行安全生产的方针。会议认为，今年除春节前进行了一次群众性的安全检查外，还要在乍暖多风的春季、暴雨多雷的夏季和用电高峰的冬季前，再发动三次群众性的安全大检查，来消灭和防止发生各种事故。会议决定，要抓紧今年第一季度用电负荷比较轻的时机，集中力量基本上完成全年的设备大检修的任务，为全年安全生产打好基础。会议还认为，今年各厂应根据具体条件，继续积极地挖掘发电设备潜力，提高发电能力。
