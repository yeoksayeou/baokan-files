Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th, TASS dispatch: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, N.S. Khrushchev, issued a statement at a press conference with Soviet and foreign journalists on the 19th. The full text is as follows:

Comrades, Gentlemen!

As you all know, some time has passed since the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany and proposals for ending the occupation regime in West Berlin were published. We have been patiently and steadfastly clarifying our position, both in the past and now. Not only the relevant governments, but also broad sections of the public have had the opportunity to fully understand the content of these important proposals from the Soviet government.

We have said, and continue to say, that the sole purpose of the Soviet government's proposals is to eliminate the remnants of World War II, normalize the situation in Berlin and throughout Germany, and thereby lay a solid foundation for eliminating the "Cold War".

We firmly believe that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the end of the occupation status of West Berlin are in the national interests of the German people and in the interests of strengthening peace and universal security. The international atmosphere not only can, but should, become cleaner, and we are working towards one thing: to make the clouds of new war disappear forever from the international horizon.

The proposal for the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the normalization of the Berlin situation has gained widespread recognition and support abroad. We are pleased that our peaceful policy is increasingly understood by the people of all countries. We attach great importance to this and will do everything possible to eliminate the consequences of World War II, strive to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, thereby promoting the establishment of a normal situation in Central Europe. This will open the beginning to clear away all the obstacles in international relations that hinder normal relations and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

The sentiment for negotiations between countries is also growing among politicians in Western countries. Increasingly, sensible views are being expressed, advocating that the German question must be resolved peacefully.

For example, it can be mentioned that during our recent meetings and talks with British Prime Minister Macmillan, it was acknowledged that the governments of the countries concerned must hold negotiations as soon as possible to resolve differences of opinion, including on issues such as the peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin problem.

Not only in European countries, but also in the United States, politicians are increasingly advocating the elimination of the dangerous situation created by the "Cold War" and the failure to resolve many major international issues fourteen years after the end of World War II.

Take the recent speech by Senator Fulbright, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for example. Although we do not agree with many of the arguments he put forward, it must be pointed out that we believe his speech also contains positive views. These views are not too far from promoting an agreement between the countries concerned on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and on the issue of eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin.

I have previously mentioned Senator Mansfield's speech, in which he also put forward some useful ideas on these issues. It is true that he later retreated somewhat from his position, but we believe that Senator Mansfield, in addition to expressing unacceptable arguments, also put forward arguments that could provide a basis for negotiation and make people expect that the countries concerned, as long as they make persistent efforts, can reach an agreement on certain contentious issues.

Other American politicians, business figures, and observers have also made many statements, expressing sober views on the German peace treaty and the Berlin problem.

In his speech on March 16, US President Eisenhower supported the idea of negotiations. He said that the United States "is fully prepared to participate in all sincere efforts to hold negotiations."

All of this proves that our proposals are vital and timely.

At the same time, it is impossible not to note the remarks of certain political and military figures in the West, who distort the true nature of the Soviet proposals on the German peace treaty and the Berlin problem, and impose unwarranted purposes on us. This makes one feel that these people still will not give up the "Cold War" methods.

We hope that our proposals can be understood correctly and that correct conclusions can be drawn from them. We are prepared to make any explanations so that no one can arbitrarily distort our proposals.

The Soviet government's proposals on the German peace treaty and the Berlin problem are not intended to gain any advantages at the expense of other countries or to harm the interests of others, because no one will suffer because the Germans obtain a peace treaty and West Berlin gets rid of the occupiers entrenched there. The conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys will eliminate the remnants of World War II, and the people of all countries will be satisfied with this.

The atmosphere in Central Europe, where disputes and military conflicts often occur, will be healthier, which is beneficial to everyone and most beneficial to the cause of peace.

We call on the governments of all countries that fought against Hitler's Germany to sit down and negotiate, resolve the issues that have matured, and sign a peace treaty with Germany. We hope that the governments of Western countries will abandon the arrogant threats of their army and navy generals against our country and sit down with us at the negotiating table. If they have reasonable suggestions, we are prepared to study these suggestions together with our suggestions.

The people of all countries expect and hope that reason will prevail in the policies of the United States and other Western countries—our allies in World War II.

The people of all countries hope that cooperation and mutual understanding will be achieved between the countries that bear the primary responsibility for peace. For us, the Soviet government, this will of the people is the law. We have put forward proposals on a peace treaty with Germany and the normalization of the Berlin situation. Now it's up to the Western countries. If they are seriously preparing for negotiations, then we are not a problem. We will do everything in our power to make the negotiations a success.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS dispatch: After issuing the statement, Khrushchev then answered some questions raised by reporters.

In answering questions about the Soviet government's attitude towards convening a foreign ministers' meeting and a summit meeting, and the prospects for convening these meetings, Khrushchev said that in the Soviet notes to Western countries, the Soviet Union had already expressed its attitude towards the issue of foreign ministers' meetings. In that note, the Soviet government agreed to the Western countries' proposal to convene this meeting. The Soviet government believes that a summit meeting is better, but it also agreed to hold a foreign ministers' meeting first.

Khrushchev refuted the Western claim that the Soviet Union had issued an "ultimatum" on the West Berlin issue. He said that May 27 is not a ultimatum, but an approximate date. The Soviet Union has put forward proposals for a peace treaty with Germany and on the Berlin issue. However, as history teaches, the answer may wait for a year, or even two years. The Soviet government believes that six months is enough to consider this issue. If the issue can be resolved not in six months, but in two months, then the Soviet Union certainly welcomes it. However, if the issue cannot be resolved in six months, then let's use seven months to resolve it.

Khrushchev said, when talking about the news that a foreign ministers' meeting will be held on May 11, that if someone makes such a proposal, then he is willing to accept it.

A reporter asked whether there is a magic power that can prompt a summit meeting to solve the problems that a foreign ministers' meeting cannot solve. Khrushchev used a Russian proverb when answering this question: "If you say one, then you have to say two." He said that if the heads of government cannot solve the problem of guaranteeing peace, then such heads of government should be replaced by their own people who demand peace.

Khrushchev then talked about the Soviet government's assessment of Eisenhower's recent speech. He said that Eisenhower, on the one hand, advocated convening a foreign ministers' meeting and said that the United States was willing to participate in a summit meeting, but on the other hand, he tried his best to make the American people insist on a rigid attitude and not make concessions on the Berlin issue. Eisenhower's speech did have contradictions.

Khrushchev said that, obviously, the American president's speech was intended to intimidate the Soviet Union, but contrary to his wishes, the president only intimidated the American people and those who yearn for peace.

Khrushchev continued by saying the American president's other talk was wiser, and more in line with the people's wishes, that is to convene the foreign ministers' meeting and summit meetings, to negotiate and solve problems that are ripe for resolution: the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the Berlin problem.

In answering questions about the Soviet Union's relations with Iraq and with the United Arab Republic, Khrushchev said that we can maintain friendly relations with both Iraq and the UAR. He said that the President of the UAR is somewhat impatient. He is a young president and is impatient. I had two pleasant meetings and conversations with him.

Khrushchev said that when the President of the UAR said that we were interfering in their internal affairs, I replied: We have not interfered; we are only defending our ideology—the doctrine of Communism, from unreasonable and unwarranted attacks. As a Communist, I have the right to defend our Communist doctrine. As for the internal affairs of the UAR, that is a matter for the people of that country themselves.

Khrushchev said that if the President of the UAR could be patient and not allow the UAR to interfere in the affairs of Iraq and other Arab countries, there would be more opportunities for the Arab countries to unite and fight to protect their independence and to fight for the independence of those Arab countries that have not yet achieved independence. We have always stood, and will continue to stand, with those who are striving for their own independence and striving to develop their economy, culture, and the welfare of their people. We have always stood on the position of non-interference, and we will remain true to this policy in the future.

### 赫鲁晓夫就德国问题发表声明  呼吁有关国家早日谈判签订对德和约  苏联将尽一切努力使谈判成功　现在要看西方国家了

    赫鲁晓夫就德国问题发表声明
    呼吁有关国家早日谈判签订对德和约
    苏联将尽一切努力使谈判成功　现在要看西方国家了
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫19日在苏联和外国记者招待会上发表了声明。全文如下：同志们，先生们！
    你们大家都知道，自从苏联的对德和约草案和结束西柏林占领制度的建议公布后，已经过去不少时间了。我们过去和现在都一直耐心和坚定不移地阐明了我们的态度。不仅有关政府，而且广泛的社会人士都有可能足够地充分了解苏联政府这些重要建议的内容。
    我们过去和现在都一直说，苏联政府建议的唯一目的在于，消除第二次世界大战的残余，使柏林和整个德国局势正常化，从而为消除“冷战”奠定良好开端。
    我们坚信，缔结对德和约和结束对西柏林的占领状态是符合德国人民的民族利益、符合加强和平和普遍安全的利益。国际气氛不仅可能、而且应该变得更加清洁，我们正在致力于一件事情：使新战争的乌云从国际地平线上永远消失。
    尽速缔结对德和约和使柏林局势正常化的主张，在外国获得了广泛的承认和支持。我们高兴的是，我们的和平政策越来越为各国人民所理解。我们很重视这一点，并将尽一切努力来消除第二次世界大战的后果，争取缔结对德和约，从而促进在中欧建立正常的局势。这样就将打开一个开端，来清除国际关系中的一切妨碍正常关系、妨碍社会制度不同的国家和平共处的芥蒂。
    主张各国之间谈判的情绪在西方国家的政治家中间也日益高涨。人们越来越多地表示明智的见解，主张必须和平解决德国问题。
    例如，可以提一下，在不久前我们同英国首相麦克米伦先生会晤和会谈的过程中得到承认，有关国家政府必须早日举行谈判，解决意见分歧，其中包括在对德和约和柏林问题这样一些问题上的分歧。
    不仅在欧洲国家，而且在美国，政治家们也都日益主张消除由于“冷战”、由于第二次世界大战结束十四年后仍没有解决许多重大的国际问题而形成的那种危险局势。
    就拿美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特先生不久前的讲话来说吧，尽管我们不同意他所提出的很多论点，但是不能不指出，我们认为在他的讲话中也包含有积极的看法。这些看法离促进有关国家就对德和约问题和就消除西柏林占领制度问题达成协议的因素并不太远。
    我从前已经提到过参议员曼斯菲尔德的讲话，他也对这些问题提出了一些有益的想法。不错，后来他从自己的立场上后退了一些，但是我们认为，参议员曼斯菲尔德除发表了不能接受的论点以外，也提出了这样一些论点：他们能提供谈判基础，并能使人期望：有关国家只要作顽强的努力，就能就某些争执问题达成协议。
    其他美国政界人士，实业界人士、观察家也发表了不少谈话，他们在对德和约问题和柏林问题上表示了清醒的见解。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔先生在3月16日的讲话中支持谈判的主张。他说，美国“准备充分参加举行谈判的一切真诚的努力”。
    这一切都证明了我们的建议是具有生命力和及时的。
    同时不能不注意到西方某些政界和军界人士的言论，他们歪曲苏联提出的关于对德和约和柏林问题建议的真正性质，硬把莫须有的目的加在我们身上。这就使人觉得，这些人士仍然不会放弃“冷战”方法。
    我们希望我们的建议能够得到正确的理解，希望能够对这些建议得出正确的结论。我们准备作任何说明，以便使任何人都不能胡乱歪曲我们的建议。
    苏联政府提出关于对德和约和柏林问题的建议，并不是想靠牺牲他国而得到什么好处，或者损害别人的利益，因为任何人也不会由于德国人得到和约和西柏林摆脱盘据在那里的占领者而蒙受损失。同两个德国签订和约将会消除第二次世界大战的残余，对此各国人民都将感到满意。
    经常发生纠纷和军事冲突的欧洲中部的气氛将更加健康，这对大家都有利，而对和平事业最为有利。
    我们呼吁所有同希特勒德国作过战的国家的政府坐下来谈判，解决已经成熟了的问题，签订对德和约。我们希望，西方国家政府摒弃自己的陆海军将领们对我国的狂妄威胁，同我们一起坐到谈判桌旁。如果他们有合理的建议，我们准备把这些建议同我们的建议放在一起加以研究。
    各国人民期待和希望，在美国和其他西方国家——我们在第二次世界大战中的盟国——的政策中理智会占上风。
    各国人民希望，对和平负有首要责任的国家之间实行合作和取得相互谅解。对我们苏联政府来说，人民的这个意志就是法律。我们提出了关于对德和约和使柏林局势正常化的建议。现在要看西方国家了。如果他们认真准备谈判，那么我们是不成问题的。我们将尽我们的一切努力使谈判成功。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：赫鲁晓夫在发表声明后，接着回答了记者们向他提出的一些问题。
    在回答关于苏联政府对召开外长级会议和政府首脑会议的态度以及召开这些会议的前途的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，在苏联给西方国家的照会中，苏联已经表示过对外长会见问题的态度，苏联政府在那次照会中同意西方国家关于召开这个会议的建议。苏联政府认为政府首脑级会见更好，但是也同意外长先举行会见。
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥了西方硬说苏联在西柏林问题上发出“最后通牒”的说法。他说，5月27日不是什么最后通牒，而是一个大概的日期。苏联提出了缔结对德和约和关于柏林问题的建议。但是，正如历史所教导的，回答会等一年，甚至两年，苏联政府认为，考虑这个问题，六个月的时间是足够的。如果问题不是用六个月，而是用两个月就可以解决，那么苏联当然欢迎。然而，如果用六个月解决不了问题，那就用七个月来解决吧。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到有关5月11日将举行外长会议的消息时说，如果有人提出这样的建议，那他愿意接受。
    有记者问道，是否有一种魔力能够促使政府首脑会议解决外长会议解决不了的问题，赫鲁晓夫在回答这个问题时用了一句俄国谚语说：“说一就得说二”。他说，如果政府首脑不能解决保证和平的问题，那么这样的政府首脑就应该由要求和平的本国人民来代替。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈了苏联政府对艾森豪威尔最近谈话的估价。他说，艾森豪威尔一方面主张召开外长会议，又说美国愿意参加政府首脑会议，而另一方面却竭力要美国人在柏林问题上坚持僵硬态度和不让步。艾森豪威尔的谈话的确有自相矛盾的地方。
    赫鲁晓夫说，显然，美国总统的谈话是想恫吓一下苏联，可是事与愿违，总统只是恫吓了美国人民和渴望和平的人们。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，美国总统的另一次谈话是比较明智的，较多地符合了人民的愿望，也就是召开外长会议和政府首脑会议，来谈判和解决已经成熟的问题——缔结对德和约和柏林问题。
    在答复关于苏联同伊拉克以及同阿拉伯联合共和国的关系的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，我们同伊拉克和阿联都能保持友好关系。他说，阿联总统有些急躁。他是一个还年青的总统，是性急的。我同他有过两次令人愉快的会晤和交谈。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当阿联总统说，我们在干涉他们的内政时，我回答说：我们没有干涉，我们只是在维护我们的思想——共产主义学说，使它不受没有理由的无缘无故的攻击。作为一个共产党人，我有权维护我们的共产主义学说。至于谈到阿联的内政，那是这个国家的人民自己的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果阿联总统能有耐心，不使阿联干涉伊拉克事务和其他阿拉伯国家的事务，就会有更多的机会使阿拉伯国家团结起来为保护自己的独立和为争取还没有得到独立的那些阿拉伯国家的独立而奋斗。我们过去和将来都始终和争取自己的独立，争取发展自己的经济、文化和人民的福利事业的人站在一起。我们始终站在不干涉的立场上，我们今后仍然忠于这一政策。
