    Grasping the daily plan, implementing the daily plan, grasping it tightly, grasping it ruthlessly—this is an important move to ensure the completion of the plan, and a good method for organizing production rhythmically.
    No matter what you do, you must have a method, and you must plan and arrange it; otherwise, you will be confused and things will not be done well. Economic work is very complicated, so it should be planned more carefully, more specifically, and more accurately. At present, some factories have the following situations: some have monthly plans but no ten-day plans; some have ten-day plans but no daily plans; some have factory-wide daily plans but no workshop, section, or shift daily plans. Some plans are well formulated, but the implementation of the plan is not grasped tightly or ruthlessly enough, and the measures are not specific enough. In short, there are still many cases of rough lines in planning work. Precisely because of this, reflected in production, it is either loose then tight, or loose in the beginning and tight at the end, and there is no reliable guarantee for the completion of the production plan. A good way to change this situation is to earnestly strengthen the planning of production, and make the plan meticulous, specific, and accurate. Not only should monthly plans be made, but daily plans should also be made as much as possible. Not only should there be factory-wide daily plans, but also workshop, section, and team daily plans. The principle is very simple: if a person takes a walk and takes every step well and quickly, his overall walking speed will be fast. Similarly, if the daily plans of each department in an enterprise are completed well, there will be no problem in completing the daily plan of the entire enterprise; if the daily plan is completed, of course the monthly plan will not fail, and the completion of the annual plan will be guaranteed.
    The greatest benefits of grasping the daily plan are: 1. Workers have clear goals to strive for every day, and they know what to do, which will make them maintain high morale from the time they go to work to the time they get off work; 2. Grasping the daily plan will organize and drive every link in an enterprise, so that every link can work together with one heart and mind, closely cooperate, and strive towards a common goal; 3. Production is rhythmic, which makes everyone proactive and feel happy. Now February has passed, and one-sixth of this year has passed. If we want to complete the tasks for the whole year, we must make arduous efforts. We hope that the comrades on the national industrial front will muster greater enthusiasm and, like the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant, grasp production fiercely and tightly from morning to night and from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, without relaxing for a moment.

### 抓日计划

    抓日计划
    订日计划，抓日计划，抓得紧，抓得狠，这是确保计划完成的重要一着，是有节奏的组织生产的一个好方法。
    无论做什么事情总要有个章法，总要计划安排一番，否则就盲无头绪，事情做不好。经济工作非常复杂，就应该计划得更细致，更具体，更准确。目前有一部分工厂有这样几种情况：有的有月计划，而没有旬计划；有的有旬计划，而没有日计划；有的有全厂日计划，而没有车间、工段或每一班的日计划。有的计划虽订得不错，但对计划的执行抓得不紧不狠，措施不具体，总之，在计划工作上粗线条的情况还不少。正因为如此，反映在生产上，不是一松一紧，就是前松后紧，生产计划的完成也就没有切实可靠的保证。改变这种情况的一个好办法就是认真加强生产的计划工作，把计划作得细致、具体、准确。不但要做出月计划，而且尽可能要做出日计划，不但要有全厂日计划，而且还要有车间、工段、班、组的日计划。道理非常简单，一个人走一段路，如果他每一步都迈的好，迈的快，他走路的整个速度就快。同样，在一个企业内如果各个部门每天的计划都完成的好，全企业日计划的完成就没有问题；日计划完成了，当然月计划就不会落空，全年计划的完成也就有了把握。
    抓日计划最大的好处是：一、职工每天有明确的奋斗目标，心中有数，会使他们从上班到下班始终保持昂扬的斗志，二、抓住日计划就会把一个企业内各个环节组织与带动起来，使各个环节同心协力，紧密配合，朝着一个共同目标努力，三、生产有节奏，它使人人主动，心情舒畅。　　现在2月已过，今年已过去六分之一的时间了，我们要完成全年的任务，还必须作艰巨的努力。我们希望全国工业战线上的同志们，鼓起更大的干劲，像北京琉璃河水泥厂一样，对生产从早到晚，从月初到月底狠狠地、紧紧地抓下去，一时一刻也不放松。
