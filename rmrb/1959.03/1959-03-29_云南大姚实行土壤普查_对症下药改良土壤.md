Yunnan's Yao County Implements Soil Survey
Improving Soil with Targeted Measures

(Our newspaper, Kunming, 28th) Based on the summary of last year's increased production experience, Yao County, Yunnan Province, conducted a comprehensive scientific survey of more than 700,000 mu of cultivated land in the county, and formulated effective measures to maximize the potential of the soil.

Yao County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production last year, with a 70% increase in grain production, realizing a "thousand-jin county." All communes conscientiously summarized different experiences in increasing production. In order to make these experiences more systematic and scientific, the county, since last winter, has adopted a method of combining training technical backbones with the masses to conduct ten soil surveys on the county's cultivated land: surveying the area and distribution of the soil; surveying the soil texture (sandy soil, loam, or clay); surveying moisture and toxic substances; surveying grades (based on yield); surveying nutrient content (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium); surveying soil layer thickness and mechanized farming conditions; surveying acidity and alkalinity and lime response; surveying fertilizer selection and response; surveying the current land use; surveying suitable crops and improvement measures. To conduct soil surveys, the county trained more than 290 technicians, who were combined with experienced farmers to divide areas and contract work, implementing field-by-field inspection and ranking of cultivated land. After nearly three months, the characteristics and production potential of various soils were basically clarified. Soil archives and soil distribution maps were established from the county to the commune and production team levels. The county party committee also required all communes to adapt measures to local conditions, prescribe the right remedy, and add measures according to the fields, so as to gradually realize soil standardization, fertilizer planning, and scientific fertilization, and plant crops according to local conditions to maximize the potential of the soil.

According to the instructions of the county party committee, the people of the county conscientiously combined their specific circumstances, mobilized the masses to use their experience in improving soil over the years, and gradually transformed sandy soil and clay into loam, achieving seven parts mud and three parts sand or eight parts mud and two parts sand, so that sandy soil becomes aggregated and clay becomes loose and soft. This year, all cultivated land will be deeply ploughed to a depth of 1.5 feet or more, changing rough cultivation to intensive cultivation, and turning dead soil into living soil, so as to gradually realize the gardening of cultivation. And by applying lime, gypsum, and rational fertilization and rational irrigation and drainage methods, all acidic and alkaline soils will be transformed into neutral soils. In the work of improving soil, the masses have summed up many experiences in transforming soil. For example, in the Shiyang Commune, over the past three years, a large amount of green manure and farmyard manure and other organic fertilizers have been applied to more than 100 mu of alkaline soil, weakening the alkalinity of the soil, and last year's yield increased by more than two times. According to the characteristics of phosphorus deficiency in most fields, each commune has established soil fertilizer plants to produce large quantities of phosphate fertilizer. In terms of fertilization methods, the practice of applying heavy base fertilizer and frequent top dressing has been universally adopted, changing the previous practice of applying heavy "cap fertilizer."

Based on the soil fertility, water conservancy, climate, and other conditions, the county has also formulated dense planting plans for different crops. Generally, rice requires 30,000 to 50,000 clumps per mu, with four to six plants per clump.

The formulation of more scientific and solid production measures from bottom to top has greatly enhanced the confidence of the broad masses and promoted this year's preparatory work and spring ploughing production. The county plans to apply 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu for this year's spring planting, and more than 60% has now been completed. After scientifically surveying the soil and rationally formulating measures to increase production, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses throughout the county to learn science has been greatly encouraged. Now, a trend has formed throughout the county where everyone studies science and everyone masters production technology. Yu Gang, the first secretary of the county party committee, has repeatedly given agricultural technology lessons to commune party committee secretaries and cadres, and has selected and trained a large number of technical cadres, who have established rice and corn research groups and technical research and promotion stations for cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and hemp in the main crop areas.

    云南大姚实行土壤普查
    对症下药改良土壤
    本报昆明28日电　云南省大姚县在总结去年增产经验的基础上，对全县七十多万亩耕地进行了全面的科学普查，制定出最能发挥土壤潜力的有效措施。
    大姚县去年的农业生产获得了空前的丰收，粮食增产七成，实现了千斤县。各个公社都认真总结出不同的增产经验，为了使这些经验更系统、更科学，全县从去冬以来，采取培训技术骨干和群众相结合的办法，对全县耕地进行土壤十查：查土壤面积和分布情况；查土壤的质地（砂土、壤土或粘土）；查水分及毒质；查等级（依据产量）；查养分含量（氮、磷、钾）；查土层厚度及机耕条件；查酸碱及石灰反映；查肥料选择与反映；查土地利用现状；查适种作物和改良措施。为进行土壤检查，全县训练了二百九十多个技术人员，与老农相结合分片包干，实行耕地逐块检查排队，经过近三个月的时间，基本上查清了各种土壤特性及生产潜力。从县到公社、生产队，都根据普查建立了土壤档案与土壤分布图。县委又要求各公社，因地制宜、对症下药、看田加措施，逐步实现土壤标准化、造肥计划化和施肥科学化，并因地种植作物，最大限度地发挥土壤潜在能力。
    根据县委指示，全县人民认真结合自己的具体情况，发动群众根据历年改良土壤的经验，逐步把砂土和粘土变为壤土，达到七泥三沙或八泥二沙，使沙土变团聚，粘土变疏软。今年全部耕地深翻一尺五以上，变粗耕为精耕，死土为活土，以逐步实现耕作园田化。并以施用石灰、石膏和合理施肥、合理灌排的办法，使所有的酸性和碱性土壤变成中性土壤。在改良土壤工作中，群众总结出许多改造土壤的经验。例如，石羊公社三年来在一百多亩碱性土壤中，施用了大量的绿肥、厩肥等有机质肥料，减弱土壤含碱性，去年产量提高二倍以上。各公社又根据多数田地缺磷的特点，队队建立土化肥厂，大量生产磷素化肥。在施肥方法上，普遍采用了重施底肥，勤施追肥，改变以往重施“盖头肥”的作法。
    全县根据土壤的肥力和水利、气候等条件，还订出了不同作物的密植方案，稻谷一般每亩要求达到三至五万丛，每丛四至六株。
    这样自下而上地制定了更为科学、更扎实的各项生产措施，大大增强了广大群众的信心，推动了今年的备耕和春耕生产。全县计划今年大春施底肥每亩两万斤，现在已经完成了60％以上。经过科学普查土壤和合理制定增产措施，大大鼓舞了全县干部群众学科学的积极性。现在全县已形成人人钻科学，个个掌握生产技术的风气，县委第一书记于刚曾多次给公社党委书记和干部上农业技术课，并抽调训练了大批技术干部，分别在各主产作物区建立了稻谷、玉米研究组和棉花、烤烟、大麻等技术研究推广站。
