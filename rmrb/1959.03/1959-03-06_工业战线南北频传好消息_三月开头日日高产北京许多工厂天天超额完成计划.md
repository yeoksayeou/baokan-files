    Industrial Front Frequently Reports Good News from North and South
    High Production Every Day at the Beginning of March; Many Factories in Beijing Overfulfilled Their Plans Daily
    (Our newspaper's report) The workers of many factories and mining enterprises in Beijing, with greater efforts, launched a battle to strive for a "Red Letter Day" in March and fully complete the production plan. According to incomplete statistics, from March 1st to 3rd, seventy-one factories, including the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Fourth Agricultural Machinery Plant, the state-owned Beijing First, Second, and Third Cotton Textile Factories, and the Yanjing Paper Mill, completed and overfulfilled their plans every day.
    In recent days, in the fiery Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the clean spinning and weaving factories, in the Jingxi Coal Mine, which spews out black gold day and night, and in the steel rolling and machinery manufacturing enterprises where machines roar, as well as in small and medium-sized factories scattered throughout the city, one can see a bustling scene of socialist production competition everywhere. Inside and outside the workshops of many factories, slogans, big-character posters, and challenge letters for comprehensively overfulfilling the first quarter's plan are posted in colorful arrays, and production success reports are dazzling.
    The slogan of the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who completed their February steel and pig iron plans ahead of schedule, is: "Seize every day, seize every month, high production in February, and even higher production in March." From March 1st to 3rd, this company has already overproduced forty-five tons of steel. According to the statistics of the company's planning department, by March 3rd, the company's workers had completed 95.75% of the state's steel production plan for the first quarter. It is expected that in the next few days, the good news of completing the steel production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule will be reported. At the Liulihe Cement Plant, more than a hundred miles away from Beijing, a mass-based, all-round great leap forward in production has been formed. The factory overproduced every day in the first three days of March, with a total overproduction of 289 tons of cement. All the factory's leaders have gone to the forefront of production. The factory workers are determined to work hard and strive for a "full house red" in the first quarter. At the beginning of March, the state-owned Beijing First Cotton Textile Factory organized production by organizing short-term battles. The first battle, which focused on improving product quality and lasted for a week, has achieved remarkable results since it began on the 1st. Leading cadres take turns participating in labor every day, specifically directing production, handing over the planned targets to the masses, and promptly promoting advanced experience. As a result, the plan is comprehensively overfulfilled every day. In the first three days, the first-grade yarn rate reached 100% every day, and the warehousing first-grade rate of cloth reached 99.03%, creating a new record that the entire factory has never had before. The planned output value of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant in March is 31% more than the total of January and February. But the workers said: This month is the key to completing the annual task. The indicators are high, and our enthusiasm is even higher. We must guarantee completion. Since the 1st, the attendance rate of the entire factory has remained above 99%. The workers of the Yu Dupeng riveting team in the first workshop of the Beijing Third General Machinery Factory, who work in the open air, persisted in production as usual in the heavy snow, and overfulfilled their production tasks on both the 1st and 2nd. The daily plan for the spot welding and forming of electrolytic cell components for this group was fifteen, but they completed twenty on the 1st and forty on the 2nd, doubling it.

    Shanghai Workers Initially Show Their Skills in the March Battle
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 5th: Shanghai's factories and enterprises are firmly grasping current production, focusing on the key to production in March, mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and fully, carrying out technical revolutions, and launching red flag competitions to ensure the completion of the greater production tasks in March and to ensure the timely completion of the production tasks of various national key products.
    The workers of the Shanghai Metallurgical Industry Bureau's iron and steel plants, who are engaged in a tense battle to produce 1.6 million tons of steel this year, are doing everything possible to seize the output of each shift and each furnace to ensure that steel production continues to increase in March. The Shanghai Steel No. 6 Plant, which has overfulfilled its output and quality plans for two consecutive months, held a forum for veteran workers and a mass meeting in the workshop at the beginning of March to summarize the experience of January and February and discuss the larger leap forward targets for March. Steelmaking workers also held a martial arts competition between shifts, challenging each other. From the 1st to the 3rd, the output of the converter workshop continued to increase, with an average daily output exceeding the planned target by more than 10%. The steel casting workshop of the Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, through mass discussion, put forward a March leap forward plan to increase production by 59% compared with February. This workshop is currently casting large castings required for the city's machinery industry to manufacture rolling mill equipment and mining equipment. The workers unanimously stated that they would complete their production plan as a major political task.
    In order to complete the tasks of urgently needed rolling mill equipment, mining equipment, and power station equipment in March, the machinery and electrical factories in Shanghai have recently made further adjustments and arrangements in raw materials and cooperative relations in accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" to ensure key points. At the same time, various factories have widely launched more extensive technical revolution movements to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and processing capacity.
    After completing the production plans for January and February, the textile industry in Shanghai continued to advance and ensured that cotton yarn production would increase by another 13% in March compared with February.

    Many Machinery Factories in Shenyang Achieved a Bumper Harvest in the First Three Days
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 5th: Many machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang, which are rushing to manufacture equipment for mines, coal washing, steel rolling, and power stations across the country, have recently launched a high-yield campaign. In the first three days of March, they completed or overfulfilled their daily production plans one after another.
    The task of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant in March increased by 65.5% compared with February. The plant originally planned to complete eighty coal washing machines by the end of April. Later, the factory party committee called on the workers to complete this task half a month to a month ahead of schedule. The factory workers quickly launched a high-yield competition centered on technological revolution, breaking the habit of "slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month." In the first three days of March, the daily output of many teams exceeded the average daily output in February. The daily output of the large planing team on March 1st increased by two times compared with the daily output in February. The riveting and welding workshop originally had a monthly production capacity of only 55,000 man-hours. The workers proposed that in March, they would ensure the completion of 85,000 man-hours on the basis of technological innovation and strive to reach 110,000 man-hours. This factory has already produced a coal washing machine on the 3rd that can wash 140 tons of coal per hour at its highest capacity. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant launched a leap forward month in March with rolling mills as the center, driving other products, and achieved a great harvest in the first three days. Many workers have broken through the man-hour quota. They are preparing to increase the machine tool production efficiency from 600 hours per month to 1,000 hours. In this way, they can ensure the completion of the manufacturing tasks of four sets of rolling mills and a batch of power station, metallurgical, and mining equipment in March. The Shenyang Water Pump Factory, which completed its monthly plan three days ahead of schedule in February, overfulfilled its production targets by more than 20% in the first three days of the high-yield month in the steel casting and processing workshops.

    Anshan Iron and Steel No. 10 Blast Furnace and Medium Plate Plant Production Rose Linearly
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 5th: The giant Anshan Iron and Steel No. 10 Blast Furnace is exerting greater power after overfulfilling the production plans for January and February. In the first four days of March, this blast furnace has already produced 8,339 tons of pig iron, exceeding the plan by 259 tons.
    This blast furnace was built and put into production in November last year. The ironmaking experts who mastered this blast furnace launched a red flag competition as soon as they went into the furnace. With the help of Soviet experts, they quickly became familiar with the operating technology of this large blast furnace, so the daily output of the blast furnace rose linearly. In January and February, it overproduced 10,536 tons of pig iron compared to the plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 5th: The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Medium Plate Plant, who continuously overfulfilled their production plans for January and February, entered March with greater enthusiasm. In the first three days, they overproduced 340 tons of high-quality steel plates for the country, exceeding the plan.
    In order to better complete the plan for the first ten days of the month, the workers of the entire plant launched a "High Production Week" competition starting on the 3rd. On the morning of the 3rd, the workers of Class A were tense and devoted to this competition as soon as they went to work. The Ding Fumin team and the Zhang Chengye team separated their lines and chased each other, continuously creating seven small-class high-yield records within eight hours; after the workers of Class B and Class C took over, they quickly caught up and also created excellent results. After the workers of the three shifts overfulfilled the task of the day, their mood was very high. They reported the victory to the Party Committee with gongs and drums, and expressed their determination to create greater achievements.
    On the first day of March, the factory party committee convened a meeting of all the factory cadres, summarized the experience of the previous month, arranged the work for March, and called on all the factory workers to overfulfill the plan every day in March. The workers of each class and section responded enthusiastically to the call of the Party Committee, immediately put forward guarantees for overfulfilling the plan, and launched a competition.

    Fuxin Coal Mine's Daily Output Increased to More Than 48,000 Tons
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, March 5th: More than 60,000 workers in the Fuxin Coal Mine, after completing the coal production task in February, made rapid progress in March. The average daily output of raw coal in the first three days reached more than 48,000 tons, an increase of 6,800 tons compared with the average daily output in February.
    From the end of February, the workers in this mining area launched a high-yield red flag competition with the workers in the Fushun Coal Mine. In order to ensure the completion of the first quarter's raw coal production task, they decided to produce 1.83 million tons of raw coal in March. At present, the competition between mines, pits, sections, and teams has been carried out vigorously. Many pit entrances have achieved shift-by-shift red and day-by-day red in the first three days of the month, and have overfulfilled the production tasks on a daily basis.
