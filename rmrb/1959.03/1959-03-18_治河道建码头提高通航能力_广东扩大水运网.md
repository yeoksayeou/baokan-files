Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 16th: Guangdong Province is taking measures to accelerate the improvement and canalization of waterways and the construction of ports, increasing the navigable mileage of rivers and improving the capacity of waterways to meet the needs of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production.

Guangdong Province is located in the subtropical zone. The province has 1,343 rivers with a total length of 25,290 kilometers. The density of river distribution ranks first in the country, and they are ice-free all year round and navigable in all seasons. Last year, Guangdong's water transport volume accounted for more than 76.5% of the province's total land and water (including railways, highways, and waterways) transportation volume. Therefore, developing a water transport network is an important part of Guangdong's development of transportation.

Guangdong's water transport development plan for this year is to develop, improve, and dredge 6,000 kilometers of waterways, bringing the navigable mileage to over 85% of the total river length. Among them, the maritime waterways responsible for ocean transportation, such as the Lingding Waterway and the Liyu Sha Waterway, began dredging in January this year and are expected to be completed in May. After dredging, the Lingding Waterway will be able to accommodate 10,000-ton freighters. The main inland river routes responsible for transporting steel and coal, such as the Lianjiang River, the Hanjiang River, and the Moyang River, have also begun to be improved. After the improvements, these waterways will be able to handle 30-ton to 200-ton barges and push-tow convoys.

Construction of ports along the coast of Guangdong Province is also being accelerated. The construction of the new large port in westernmost China, Longmen Port in Qin County, has begun. The expansion project of Guangzhou Port is also being accelerated and is scheduled to be completed within this year. In addition, a series of modern docks, warehouses, and mechanized loading and unloading equipment are also planned to be built in ports such as Zhanjiang, Basuo, Shantou, and Jiangmen this year. Inland river medium and small ports are preparing to build and expand a number of simple docks, warehouses, and freight yards to increase the number of berths and cargo storage space in these ports. In addition, Guangdong Province also plans to add hundreds of thousands of tons of ships and equipment this year to increase transportation capacity.

    治河道建码头提高通航能力
    广东扩大水运网
    新华社广州16日电　广东省采取加速整治和渠化航道、建设港口等措施，增加河流的通航里程和提高航道的通过能力，以适应工农业生产飞跃发展的需要。
    广东省地处亚热带，全省有一千三百四十三条河流，长达二万五千二百九十公里；河流分布的密度居全国首位，而且终年不冻，四季都可通航。去年广东水运的货运量，占全省水陆（包括铁路、公路、水路）运输总量的76.5％以上，因此开发水运网，是广东省发展交通运输事业的重要环节。
    广东省今年水运的发展规划是：开发、整治、疏浚航道六千公里，使通航里程占到河流总长的85％以上。其中，担负着远洋运输的海上水道：伶仃水道、鲤渔沙水道，已于今年1月动工疏浚，估计5月份即可完成，伶仃水道经过疏浚后，能够通航一万吨的巨轮。担负钢铁、煤炭运输任务的内河主要航线，如连江、韩江、漠阳江等航道，亦已动工整治。经过整治后，这些航道将能够行驶三十吨至二百吨的驳船和航行顶推拖带船队。
    广东省沿海各港口的建设工程也正在加紧施工。我国最西边的新建大港——钦县龙门港，已开始动工兴建。广州港扩建工程也正在加速施工，计划今年内全部建成。此外，湛江、八所、汕头、江门等港口，今年内还计划兴建一系列的现代化的码头、仓库及机械化装卸设备。内河的中小港口则准备新建和扩建一批简易码头和仓库、货场，使这些港口增加泊位和堆存货位。此外，广东省今年还计划增加几十万吨的船只设备，以增加运输能力。
