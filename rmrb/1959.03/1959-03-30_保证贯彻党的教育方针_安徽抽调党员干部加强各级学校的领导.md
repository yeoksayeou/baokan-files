To ensure the implementation of the Party's education policy, Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have transferred a large number of Party cadres to take on leadership roles in various types of schools, strengthening the Party's leadership over education. More than 10,000 Party leaders and cadres have been transferred to universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout Anhui. The original five institutions of higher education and the newly established Anhui University have been assigned 40 people, including Party secretaries, presidents, deans, provosts, bursars, ministers, and branch secretaries of departments and faculties. Party committees have been established in all schools. 1,325 Party cadres, including principals, vice-principals, branch secretaries, deans of studies, bursars, and Youth League cadres, have been assigned to 768 secondary schools. 729 secondary schools have been equipped with Party member principals, accounting for 93.6% of secondary schools. Larger secondary schools have also been doubly staffed. In primary schools, more than 9,000 Party member principals have also been assigned. At the same time, in accordance with the Party's policy on Party building, Party members have been actively and cautiously developed among teachers and staff.

With the arrival of a large number of Party cadres in schools, the Party's leadership over school work has been greatly strengthened. Most of these newly appointed Party cadres, who have been tempered by years of practical struggle and have rich experience in mass work, are active and enthusiastic about school work. They have conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of combining education and labor, significantly improving the quality of education in schools throughout the province and greatly strengthening students' labor concepts. For example, after Anhui Medical College transferred a large number of Party cadres, it established Party general branches according to teaching units and equipped them with full-time Party cadres to lead, ensuring that the Party organization was present at all levels of the school, thereby guaranteeing the implementation of the education policy. After Anhui University transferred a large number of Party cadres, the Party committee strengthened the ideological work of teachers, uniting both new and old teachers. While fully leveraging the expertise of veteran teachers, it also paid attention to boldly organizing young teachers to teach independently. For example, the general Party branch of the Mathematics Department mobilized veteran teachers to better help young teachers, establishing a weekly scientific report discussion meeting system, where they took turns reporting and discussing relevant scientific topics and literature under the guidance of veteran teachers, in order to improve the teaching and scientific research level of young teachers. Veteran teachers, due to the Party's care and respect, are able to prepare lessons conscientiously and actively strive to undertake more important courses, thereby solving the difficulty of insufficient teachers. At the same time, the Party committee also actively encouraged and supported teachers and students to conduct scientific research. In a few months, teachers and students of the Physics Department successfully manufactured analog electronic computers and other various instruments. The school's teaching and scientific research activities have been progressing well.

After a large number of Party cadres were transferred to serve as principals in secondary schools in Fuyang County, each school established Party branches, Youth League committees, and Youth League branches. In the course of conscientiously implementing the Party's education policy and carrying out the struggle between the two roads and the two methods, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, the mass line was followed, and debates were conducted in a guided manner, criticizing various bourgeois educational viewpoints, correcting the political direction, and clarifying the principle that education must serve the proletariat.

    保证贯彻党的教育方针
    安徽抽调党员干部加强各级学校的领导
    本报讯　安徽省各级党委调配大批党员干部，到各类学校担任领导工作，加强了党对教育事业的领导。安徽各地为大、中、小学调配的党员领导干部有一万多人。原有五所高等学校和新建的安徽大学，已配置了党委书记、校长、院长、教务长、总务长、部长、系科总支书记等四十人，各校都建立了党委会。七百六十八所中等学校调配了校长、副校长、支部书记、教导主任、总务主任，团干等党员干部一千三百二十五人，有七百二十九所中学配备了党员校长，占中等学校的93.6％，规模较大的中学还作了双线配备。在小学中，也已调配党员校长九千余人。同时，各学校还根据建党方针，在教职员中积极、慎重地发展了党员。
    大批党员干部调到学校后，党对学校工作的领导大大加强。这些新任学校领导工作的党员干部，多数都经过了多年的实际斗争锻炼，有着丰富的群众工作经验，对学校工作积极、热情，认真地贯彻了党的教育和劳动相结合的方针，使全省各学校教育质量显著提高，学生劳动观念大大加强。如安徽医学院调配大批党员干部后，根据教学单位建立了党总支，并配备专职党员干部领导，使学校层层都有党的组织，因而保证了教育方针的贯彻。安徽大学调配了大批党员干部后，党委加强了教师的思想工作，把新、老教师都团结起来。在充分发挥老教师专长的同时也注意放手组织青年教师独立开课。如数学系党总支发动老教师更好地帮助青年教师，建立了每周举行教研组的科学报告讨论会制度，在老教师帮助下，轮流报告和讨论有关科学专题和文献，以提高青年教师的教学与科学研究水平。老教师也因党的关怀和尊重，都能认真备课，并主动争取担任较重要的课程，从而解决了师资不足的困难。同时，党委也积极鼓励，支持教师和学生进行科学研究。几个月中，物理系师生制造成功了模拟式电子计算机和其他各种仪器。学校的教学和科学研究活动一直进行得较好。
    阜阳县各中等学校，在调配了大批党员干部担任校长后，各校均建立了党支部、团委会、团支部。在认真贯彻执行党的教育方针，开展两条道路、两种方法的斗争中，在党支部的统一领导下，走群众路线，有领导地进行辩论，批判了形形色色的资产阶级教育观点，端正了政治方向，明确了教育必须为无产阶级服务的道理。
