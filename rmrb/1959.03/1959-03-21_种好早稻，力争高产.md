Cultivate Early Rice Well, Strive for High Yields

"The spring breeze has greened the south bank again." In the Lingnan area, the intense work of cultivating and transplanting early rice has already begun. Provinces in the Yangtze River basin are also stepping up preparations for sowing early rice. The battle to win a bumper harvest of early rice has reached the point where the drums are beating and the game is about to begin.

Striving for a bumper summer harvest is the first great battle on the agricultural production front this year. Winning this battle will make it more certain that we will achieve 1050 billion catties of grain this year. The bumper harvest in the first season not only has a material impact on the overall bumper harvest, but also has an immeasurable inspirational and driving effect in terms of morale. Summer-harvested crops promote autumn-harvested crops, one wave higher than another – this is an important experience from the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958. Among the summer-harvested crops, wheat and early rice occupy the most important positions. On the wheat front, the movement for large-scale high-yield production is constantly rising. Now, on the early rice front, a high tide of large-scale high-yield production movement should also be quickly launched.

In recent years, the area of early rice cultivation in our country has continuously expanded, and the yield has rapidly increased. In 1957, more than 118 million mu of early rice were planted nationwide, producing more than 38.6 billion catties of rice, accounting for 40% of the 96.5 billion catties of grain in the first season. In 1958, the area of early rice increased to more than 146 million mu, producing more than 87 billion catties of rice, and the increase in early rice production accounted for 60% of the increased grain production in the first season. It is not difficult to see how important striving for a bumper harvest of early rice is in the struggle to ensure a bumper harvest in the first season! This year, the preparations for early rice production are better than in any previous year, the masses' awareness has increased, they are more motivated, and the leadership experience of cadres at all levels is also richer. The yield per unit area of early rice has always been one to two times higher than that of wheat. Now that wheat can strive for a yield of 1,000 catties per mu on a large area, it is entirely necessary and possible to strive for large-scale high-yield production in early rice. Last year, there were already three provinces with early rice yields of 1,000 catties, more than 100 counties with early rice yields of 1,000 catties, and about 15 million mu of early rice fields with yields of 1,000 catties; there were also many early rice fields with yields of several thousand catties per mu. These facts show that the potential for increasing early rice production is still very large. This year, the conditions for striving for a bumper harvest of early rice are even better, and we should strive to have more provinces with yields of 1,000 catties or more per mu, and more special districts, counties, and people's communes with yields of 1,000 catties, 1,500 catties, or even 2,000 catties per mu.

To achieve a bumper harvest of early rice, it is necessary to ensure a certain planting area so that the first season's bumper harvest can be built on a reliable foundation. The greatest advantage of early rice is that it is less affected by natural disasters and is relatively easy to guarantee a harvest. According to historical meteorological records, drought is more serious in many southern provinces in July and August. In Fujian Province, from 1950 to 1958, seven out of eight years were affected by drought. In coastal areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other provinces, typhoons often cause damage in August and September. In recent years, large-scale farmland capital construction has greatly enhanced the ability to resist disasters, but the threat of natural disasters to crops still exists. Early rice generally matures and is harvested in July, which can avoid seasonal drought and typhoons, and can also be less affected by pests. Early rice has always been a bumper and guaranteed harvest in these areas. Therefore, sufficient attention must be paid to early rice to ensure a certain planting area.

Now, in most areas, early rice is about to be sown. In order to ensure the area of early rice planting, the planting plan must be implemented. Tasks and measures should be arranged to the team and the field, and a production responsibility system should be established and improved. The early rice planting plan has not yet been finalized in some areas and should be finalized quickly. Without a plan, the goals will not be clear, and there will not be sufficient material preparation and greater motivation. If you relax one step, you will not be tight in every step, and the leap forward plan will fall through.

Spring is pressing, the opportunity must not be missed, and time will not come again. Now is the time to make a decisive decision on how to fight this battle for a bumper harvest in the first season in rice-growing areas. Judging from the current situation, appropriately increasing the area of early rice sowing, resolutely adopting effective yield-increasing measures, and striving for a bumper harvest of early rice is the best policy.

According to the characteristics of early rice and the experience of bumper harvests of early rice in previous years, grasping the main measures of water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and density, seizing the time, catching up with the season, sowing and transplanting early, sowing and transplanting well, so that the rice roots are firmly established, is the key to striving for a bumper harvest of early rice. Early rice mainly absorbs nutrients from the outside world during the "vegetative growth period" before jointing and heading. When it grows to a certain time and under certain temperature conditions, it will enter the "reproductive growth period." During the reproductive growth period, the nutrients accumulated in the stems and leaves will be continuously transported to the grains. Because the growth of early rice is from low temperature to high temperature, the temperature is getting higher and higher, the later the planting, the shorter the vegetative growth period, and the less nutrients absorbed. Early sowing and transplanting can appropriately extend the growth period of early rice, allowing it to absorb more nutrients and accumulate richer nutrients, which can result in larger ears and more grains. However, early planting also has unfavorable factors. The weather in early spring is cool, and early planting often leads to rotten seeds and rotten seedlings, which must be highly vigilant. Advocating early sowing must not be seen as the earlier the better. The early rice sowing season in the south is when the cold wave from the north is moving south, and the temperature changes a lot and is unstable. Experienced farmers often seize the end of the first cold wave and seize the time to sow when the weather is about to turn from cold to warm; by doing so, the seedlings can grow more roots, take root firmly, have a relatively strong organization, and grow more healthily before the next cold weather arrives, and can withstand even the attack of cold waves. To advance sowing, advanced seedling cultivation methods must be adopted. In recent years, with efforts in various aspects, many good experiences have been gained that can not only advance sowing but also prevent rotten seedlings, such as using moist seedling fields or adding coverings and windbreaks. These experiences should be vigorously promoted.

In terms of seedling cultivation, it is necessary to emphasize cultivating strong seedlings, which is the first hurdle to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice. With strong seedlings, it is possible to prepare conditions for increasing ear primordia and striving for a bumper harvest. With the promotion of close planting, the area of seedling fields has increased and must be specifically calculated and rationally arranged. The amount of seeding should not be too much in order to cultivate strong seedlings and avoid wasting seeds and labor; the seeding should not be too little, so as not to affect the rational degree of close planting and the planting area.

Early rice has a short growth period and few tillers. In order to ensure more plants and more ears, rational close planting must be implemented on the basis of deep plowing and more fertilization. The density of early rice is suitable for planting how many plants, because the area is different, the transplanting time is different, the variety is different, and the deep plowing and fertilization conditions are different, and it cannot be mechanically specified; all regions must implement rational close planting according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, that is to say, they should formulate different rational close planting specifications and methods that are conducive to local leap forward and increased production based on different situations and existing experiences through mass discussions. It is necessary to continue to criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking on close planting, and to prevent the tendency of blindly close planting. Sparse planting is certainly not good, but it is not the denser the better, and especially cannot rigidly stipulate a highly dense planting specification for the masses to mechanically implement. How dense is considered reasonable? To solve this problem, we must consult with the masses to come to a practical conclusion. In this matter, special attention should be paid to the mass line. Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, initially stipulated that an average of 60,000 holes should be planted per mu, using the 5×2 method, planting 600,000 seedlings per mu; after a meeting discussion with the active participants and old farmers, it was unanimously agreed that: in the plains, where there are more people and less land (each person only has more than one mu of land), there is more labor and good fertilizer, it is required to plant 600,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu; in the mountainous areas, where there are fewer people and more land (each person has about ten mu), there is less labor and poor fertilizer, at most only 400,000 seedlings can be achieved. This method of following the mass line and adapting to local conditions is what every region must adopt when implementing close planting. To increase the yield of rice, we cannot simply focus on close planting in isolation. We should strengthen various measures under the condition of reasonable density to ensure ventilation and light transmission, and continuously supply nutrition in a timely and appropriate amount, and strive for more ears, larger ears, and more full grains. When promoting rational close planting, the relationship between agricultural seasons and labor should be taken into account. The transplanting period should not be delayed because of excessive pursuit of close planting, or the use of thin seedlings and bad seedlings to fill the number, which is not conducive to increasing yield.

Judging from the growth of wheat this year, plants with tillers are strong seedlings, and those without tillers are slender seedlings. Rice is also a plant with tillering characteristics, and its plant is larger than wheat, and its tillering ability is also stronger. Therefore, each rice plant must be given an appropriate nutritional area to meet its growth and development needs. It is necessary to ensure the number of plants necessary for increasing production per unit area, and also to ensure that plants obtain certain growth and development conditions, so that individual plants can fully exert their yield-increasing potential in the growth of the group. To obtain high yields, it is still necessary to rely on the main ears, but there must be appropriate effective tillers, so as to ensure the healthy growth of plants and achieve the goal of large ears and many grains.

While doing a good job in sowing, we must also prepare the fields as early as possible, "rather let the field wait for the seedlings, than let the seedlings wait for the field." Last winter and this spring, all regions carried out deep plowing of rice fields and water conservancy construction, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest of early rice. At present, special attention should be paid to applying sufficient base fertilizer, advancing topdressing, ensuring that the transplanted seedlings return to green quickly and tiller early, and meeting the needs of fertilizer during the "vegetative growth period" before panicle initiation after transplanting, according to the characteristics of the short growth period of early rice.

When considering the local early rice sowing and transplanting time, the amount of seeds used during sowing, the ratio of seedling fields to rice fields, planting density and planting methods, etc., we must follow the mass line, with leading cadres, experienced farmers, and scientific researchers discussing together. We should adopt the tested and reliable experiences in last year's Great Leap Forward, adapt to different conditions, and adopt different methods that are indeed effective locally. Those methods that are not sure or not very sure can only be tested in small experimental fields, and should not be rashly promoted on a large area. Combining energy with scientific analysis, combining leadership with the masses, is what must be implemented throughout the entire process of striving for a bumper harvest of early rice.

Once spring arrives, production work in rural areas is launched in all directions, and priorities must be distinguished and arrangements must be made comprehensively and reasonably. In various parts of the south, we must not only do a good job in the field management of overwintering crops, but also not relax in the slightest all the work to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice. It is necessary to ensure that the yield per unit area of early rice greatly exceeds that of wheat, and strive to go upstream and further upstream.

    种好早稻，力争高产
    “春风又绿江南岸”。岭南地区，早已开始了紧张的早稻育秧、插秧工作。长江流域各省也正在加紧准备播种早稻。争取早稻大丰收的战斗，已经到了擂鼓上场的时候。
    争取夏季大丰收，是今年农业生产战线上第一个伟大的战役。这一仗打胜了，今年取得一万零五百亿斤粮食就更有把握了。第一季的大丰收，对全国大丰收所起的作用，不只是物质上的，同时在精神上也有不可估量的鼓舞、推动作用。夏收作物促进秋收作物，一浪高过一浪，这是1958年农业大跃进的一项重要经验。在夏收作物中，麦子和早稻占着最重要的地位。在小麦方面，大面积丰产运动正在不断高涨。现在，在早稻方面，也该赶快掀起一个大面积高额丰产运动的高潮。
    近几年来，我国早稻面积不断扩大，产量迅速提高。1957年全国种早稻一亿一千八百多万亩，产稻谷三百八十六亿多斤，占第一季粮食九百六十五亿多斤的40％。1958年早稻面积增加到一亿四千六百多万亩，产稻谷八百七十多亿斤，早稻的增产占第一季增产粮食的60％。不难看出，争取早稻丰收，在确保第一季丰收的斗争中占着多么重要的地位！今年在早稻方面的生产准备工作比以往任何一年都好，群众觉悟提高了，干劲更足了，各级干部的领导经验也更丰富了。早稻的单位面积产量，历来就比小麦高一、二倍。现在，既然小麦可以在大面积上力争亩产千斤，那末，在早稻方面也完全有必要和可能争取大面积高额丰产。去年，已经出现了三个早稻千斤省，一百多个早稻千斤县，大约一千五百万亩早稻千斤田；亩产几千斤的早稻田也很多。这些事实说明，早稻增产的潜力还是很大的。今年争取早稻大丰收的条件更好了，应该力争有更多的省亩产量达到千斤以上，有更多的专区、县、人民公社亩产量达到一千斤、一千五百斤以至两千斤。
    要取得早稻大丰收，就要确保有一定的种植面积，这样才能使头季丰产建立在可靠基础上。早稻的最大的好处就是受自然灾害影响较少，比较容易保收。据历年气象记载，南方不少省份7、8月间旱象比较严重。福建省1950年到1958年八年中，有七年受旱。在浙江、江苏、福建等省沿海地区，8、9月份又常受台风为害。近年来大搞农田基本建设，抗灾能力大大增强了，但自然灾害对农作物的威胁还是存在的。早稻一般在7月份成熟、收割，能够避免季节的干旱和台风，也可以少受虫害。这些地区历年来早稻都是丰产保收的。因此，必须对早稻给予足够的重视，保证有一定的播种面积。
    现在，绝大部分地区的早稻，就要播种了。为了确保早稻种植面积，种植计划一定要落实。任务和措施要安排到队、到田，并且要建立和健全生产责任制度。部分地区早稻种植计划还没有最后确定，应当迅速定下来。计划不定，奋斗目标不明确，就不会有充分的物质准备和更大的干劲。一步放松，步步不紧，跃进计划就会落空的。
    春光逼人，机不可失，时不再来，今年水稻地区争取第一季大丰收这一仗如何打法，现在是当机立断的时候了。从目前形势看，适当增加早稻播种面积，坚决采取有效的增产措施，力争早稻丰收，这是上策。
    根据早稻特性和历年早稻丰产经验，抓住水、肥、土、种、密几项主要措施，抢时间，赶季节，早播早插，播好插好，使水稻脚根站稳，是争取早稻丰收的关键。早稻从外界吸收养分，主要是在拔节抽穗前的“营养生长期”。它生长到一定时间，在一定温度条件下，就要进入“繁殖生长时期”。在繁殖生长期中，茎叶中积累的养分，就要源源不断地输送到籽粒中去。因为早稻生长是由低温走向高温的，气温越来越高，种植越迟，营养生长期越短，吸收的养分也就越少。提早播种插秧，就可以适当延长早稻的生长期，使它吸收更多的养料，积蓄更丰富的营养物质，可以长得穗大粒多。但早种也有不利的因素，早春天气凉，早种往往发生烂种烂秧现象，必须引起高度警惕。提倡早播，决不能看成是越早越好。南方早稻播种季节，正是北方寒流南下的时候，气温变化多，不稳定。有经验的农民常常抓住第一个寒流末尾，在天气将要由寒转暖的时候，抓紧时间播种；这样做，可以使秧苗在下一个冷气候到来之前，根已经长多了，扎稳了，组织比较强硬了，生长得比较健壮了，即使受到寒潮的袭击也抗得住。要提早播种，必须采取先进的育秧方法。近几年来，在各方面努力下已经取得不少既能提早播种、又能防止烂秧的好经验，如采用湿润秧田或加复盖物、防风障等，这些经验，应当大力推广。
    在育秧方面，要强调培育壮秧，这是争取早稻丰收第一关。有了健壮的秧苗，才能为增大穗胎、争取丰收准备条件。推广密植后，秧田面积增加了，必须具体计算，合理安排。播种量不宜过多，以便培育壮秧，以免耗费种子和劳力；播种也不要太少，以免影响合理的密植程度和种植面积。
    早稻生长期短，分蘖少，为了保证株多穗多，必须在深耕、多施肥的基础上，实行合理密植。早稻的密度究以栽多少株为宜，因为地区不同，插秧时期不同，品种不同，深耕施肥情况不同，不能机械规定；各地必须根据因地制宜的原则，实行合理密植，就是说，应当根据不同情况和已有的经验，通过群众讨论，制定不同的有利于当地跃进增产的合理密植的规格和方式。既要继续批判对密植的右倾保守思想，又要防止盲目密植的偏向。稀植固然不好，但也不是越密越好，尤其不能生硬规定一个高度密植的规格，要群众机械执行。怎样密植才算合理呢？要解决这个问题，必须和群众商量，才能得出切合实际的结论。在这件事情上，要特别注意走群众路线。浙江省瑞安县最初规定每亩平均插六万穴，采用5×2的方式，每亩栽六十万苗；经过积极分子和老农共同参加的会议讨论，一致认为：在平川地区人口多土地少（每人只合一亩多地），劳力多，肥料好，要求每亩栽六十万到八十万苗；在山区人口少，土地多（每人约合十亩），劳力少，肥料差，最多只能达到四十万苗。这种走群众路线和因地制宜的方法，是每个地区在实行密植的时候必须采取的。提高水稻的产量，不能孤立地单从密植上做文章，应当在具有合理密度的情况下，加强各项措施，保证通风透光，并且适时适量地源源不断地供给营养，力争穗多穗大，粒多粒饱。在推广合理密植时，要考虑到农事季节和劳动力的关系，不能因为过分追求密植延误插秧时期，或用瘦苗坏秧滥竽充数，这些对产量的提高，都是不利的。
    从今年小麦生长情况来看，有分蘖的植株才是壮苗，没有分蘖的则是纤苗。水稻也是具有分蘖特性的植物，而且它的植株比小麦大，分蘖力也强。因此，必须给水稻每个植株以适当的营养面积，以满足其生长发育的需要。既要保证在单位面积上增产所必需的株数，又要保证植株获得一定生长发育的条件，使个体植株能够在群体的生长中，充分发挥其增产潜力。要获得高产，还是要靠主穗的，但必须要有适当的有效分蘖，这样才能保证植株生长健壮，达到穗大粒多的目的。
    在作好播种工作的同时，还必须及早作好本田准备，“宁叫田等秧，不叫秧等田”。去冬今春，各地都进行了稻田深耕和兴修水利工作，给早稻丰收打下了基础。目前应当特别注意的是按照早稻生长期较短的特点，施足底肥，提早追肥，确保移植后的秧苗返青快、分蘖早，并满足插秧后孕穗前这一段“营养生长期”对肥料的需要。
    在考虑当地早稻播种栽插时间、播种时的用种量、秧田与本田的比例、栽插密度与栽插方式等等问题的时候，都必须走群众路线，领导干部、有经验的农民以及科学研究人员一起讨论。应当采取去年大跃进中经过考验的确有把握的经验，适应不同条件，采取不同的但在当地确有成效的方法。那些没有把握或把握不大的方法，只可以在小块试验地上试验，不要贸然在大面积上推广。干劲和科学分析相结合，领导和群众相结合，这是在争取早稻大丰收的整个过程中必须贯彻始终的。
    春天一到，农村中的生产工作万箭齐发，必须分清先后缓急，全面合理安排。在南方各地，目前既要搞好越冬作物的田间管理工作，又不能丝毫放松争取早稻丰收的一切工作。一定要使早稻单位面积产量大大超过小麦，力争上游更上游。
