    Moist Seedbeds Reduce Rotting Seedlings and Increase Seedling Count
    Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture
    Hubei Province vigorously promoted moist seedbeds last year with excellent results. These seedbeds have three characteristics:
    1. Clear distinction between ditches and seedbeds. Generally, the seedbeds are four to five feet wide, the ditches are eight inches wide and two to three inches deep, with level seedbeds and connected ditches.
    2. After sowing, mix various types of ash with fine soil or fine sand, aged wall soil, hearth soil, topsoil, etc., to cover the seeds, helping to keep them warm and moist, and to establish roots and emerge quickly.
    3. From sowing until the seedlings turn green, except during strong winds and heavy rain when short-term irrigation is permissible, the seedbed surface should be kept moist as long as there is water in the ditches. Generally, even during cold spells and rainy days, avoid irrigating and prevent water from flooding the seedbed surface.
    Due to these characteristics of moist seedbeds, they demonstrate their superiority—fewer rotting seedlings and more seedlings. Because the surface of the moist seedbed has no standing water and has a covering, it can retain warmth and has sufficient air. After sowing, the seedling roots quickly penetrate downwards, seeking water and fertilizer, resulting in early emergence, numerous roots, and no lodging. In addition, there is no harm from green algae, duckweed, chironomid larvae, snails, etc. The seedlings grow strong and uniform, with fewer weak seedlings. According to experiments conducted by the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute, the rotting seedling rate in moist seedbeds is only 6.87%, while the rotting seedling rate in general seedbeds reaches 21.14% to 32.27%.
    Prepare the fields early, cultivate meticulously
    Seedbeds must be prepared meticulously to facilitate the cultivation of strong seedlings. It is required to universally implement five procedures: plowing, harrowing, cultivating, rolling, and leveling, truly achieving a field as flat as a mirror, mud as soft as paste, clean banks, and removal of weeds and rice stubble.
    Fertilizing seedbeds is a crucial step in cultivating strong seedlings. Because seedlings grow in seedbeds for a short time and early spring temperatures are low, more quick-acting and dry fertilizers should be used as base fertilizer. Using unfermented raw cakes, fresh manure, or green grass can cause rotting seedlings. The fertilization method should also be improved. Because fertilizer loss is low in moist seedbeds and the sowing density is increased, the proportion of surface soil fertilizer should be increased so that seedlings can absorb sufficient fertilizer as soon as they take root. This is why dense sowing does not result in thin seedlings, and early sowing allows them to grow quickly, tenderly, and strongly.
    After preparing the seedbeds, dig surrounding ditches for drainage and irrigation. Following the specifications for moist seedbeds, level the seedbed surface repeatedly after digging the ditches, ensuring there are no uneven areas and avoiding a turtle-back shape. Also, avoid smoothing the sides of the ditches too much to prevent hindering water permeability.
    Select seeds carefully, disinfect strictly
    Before sowing, seeds must undergo a series of treatments. First, sun the seeds. The purpose of sunning the seeds is to promote uniform and robust germination and enhance seed vitality, as well as to facilitate water absorption during soaking. Exposure time should be two to three days, spread thinly and stir frequently so that every grain is exposed to sunlight.
    Second, select the seeds. Through wind sifting, screening, and selection using yellow mud water, achieve the goal of no empty grains, no impurities, and no half grains. If these are not removed, half grains that cannot germinate after sowing will rot in the field, causing rotting seedlings. Empty grains will also propagate in the field, affecting seedling growth.
    Third, disinfect the seeds. Early Japonica rice seeds often carry rice blast spores and should be treated with formalin. The method is to mix one catty of the liquid with fifty catties of water and spray it on four to five hundred catties of seeds, sealing it tightly for three hours. Early Indica rice should be soaked in 1% lime water for forty-eight hours (two days and two nights). After seed treatment, wash thoroughly with clean water, then soak or sprout them.
    Fourth, soak thoroughly, sprout evenly. Early Japonica rice generally needs to be soaked for three days and three nights, while early Indica rice generally needs to be soaked for two days and two nights, allowing the grains to absorb 25% of their weight in water, which is considered thoroughly soaked. Sprouting requires great care, paying close attention to temperature and preventing burning the sprouts. Maintain the temperature between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius during sprouting and stir frequently to ensure uniform sprouting and consistent length. When the sprouts are one to two fen long, spread them out to dissipate heat and sow as soon as the weather clears. If the weather changes suddenly and you cannot go to the fields after sprouting, spread them thinly, paying attention to stirring, and sow when the weather clears.
    Pass the Five Tests
    1. Early. Early rice should be sown at the appropriate time, erring on the early side, to facilitate early transplanting and early maturity, as well as early transplanting of the second-season late rice. Because the temperature is low in March and the climate changes greatly, grasp the cold wave patterns, sow during clear weather, and arrange the soaking and sprouting time during the cold wave and rainy periods. After sprouting is completed, the weather will be clear, allowing you to seize several clear days for sowing, facilitating root establishment and preventing losses. Early rice sowing should also be based on variety characteristics, transplanting sequence in the fields, and the amount of transplanting labor, with staggered and batch sowing to avoid one-time sowing leading to old seedlings and reduced production.
    2. Dense. This year, the early rice area has expanded and the transplanting density has increased. Therefore, the amount of seeds used per mu has also increased from more than twenty catties last year to forty to eighty catties. In order to cultivate sufficient seedlings, in addition to expanding some of the seedbeds, it is also necessary to increase the sowing amount per mu of seedbed.
    3. Even. Even sowing is the foundation for strong, uniform, and complete seedlings. Try every means to achieve even sowing so that each seedling has a certain nutritional area and grows uniformly. If each catty of seeds produces 14,000 seedlings, and each mu of seedbed has 600,000 square inches, with a seedbed utilization rate of 85%, then sowing 400 catties per mu will result in only 11.2 seedlings per square inch. It is generally possible to achieve even sowing based on this standard. How can even sowing be achieved? First, select people with sowing experience or conduct sowing technical training before sowing. Second, divide the seeds according to the seedbed area, determine the amount of seeds to be used for each seedbed, and let the sowers know the amount. Third, adopt the method of "sparse first, then supplement, fill the gaps three times" during sowing to achieve true evenness.
    4. Strong. After sowing, immediately strengthen seedbed management, remove weeds and skins in a timely manner, apply topdressing fertilizer early to cultivate strong seedlings, and pay close attention to pest occurrence. Apply "666" insecticide once or twice in the seedbeds to prevent insects. When the climate changes, pay attention to keeping warm and preventing frost. Completing this series of tasks will successfully complete the seedling cultivation mission.
    5. Tender. Transplanting tender seedlings allows for rapid recovery, early tillering, and slightly earlier maturity, and can also stagger labor, especially when the sowing density is high and the transplanting area is large. It is even more important to transplant tender seedlings early. Therefore, as long as the seedlings can be transplanted, transplant them as early as possible. Do not wait for the seedlings to grow very tall and reach an age of more than thirty days before transplanting, which would miss the opportunity. Apply fertilizer heavily to the cultivated field for early transplanted seedlings. Temporarily avoid transplanting when the cold wave is coming. Irrigate and keep warm for transplanted seedlings to reduce seedling death in the fields.

    湿润秧田烂秧少成苗多
    湖北省农业厅
    湖北省去年大力推广湿润秧田，效果很好。这种秧田有三个特点：
    1、沟厢分明。一般厢宽四至五尺，沟宽八寸、深二至三寸，厢平沟通。
    2、播种以后，用各种火灰拌和细土或细砂、陈壁土、灶心土、地皮土……盖住种子，帮助保温保湿，扎根立针。
    3、从播种到现青以前，除了在狂风暴雨时可以短时间灌水外，平时只要沟里有水，厢面保持湿润状态，一般寒潮雨天，也要坚持不灌水，避免水漫厢面。
    由于湿润秧田有这几个特点，所以就显示了它的优越性——烂秧少，成苗多。因为湿润秧田厢面没有水，又有复盖物，能够保温，空气充足，播种后秧根很快下扎，找水找肥，因之就立针早，根系多，不倒苗；加上又没有青苔、牛毛毡、摇泥虫、螺丝等为害，秧苗生长健壮整齐，脚秧少。据华中农业科学研究所的试验，湿润秧田烂秧仅6.87％，而一般秧田烂秧率达到21.14％到32.27％。
    早整田，精耕细整
    秧田要整得精细，才有利于培育壮秧。要求普遍做到犁、耙、耖、轧、平等五道手续，真正达到田平如镜，泥烂如糊，四岸刮光，杂草谷蔸拣净。
    秧田施肥是培育壮秧的重要环节。由于秧苗在秧田中生长的时间短，早春气温又较低，所以底肥要多用速效肥、燥性肥。如果用了没有腐熟的生饼、鲜粪、青草就会引起烂秧。在施肥方法上也要改进，因为湿润秧田肥料流失少，同时播种量增加，所以要提高表土肥的比重，使秧苗一扎根，就能吸收充足的肥料。这些就是密播了也不会线苗，早播也能长得快、嫩、壮的原因。
    秧田整好后，四围开好围沟，以便排水灌水。并按照湿润秧田的规格，开沟后再把厢面反复推平，不能有高低不平的地方，也不要做成龟背形，沟的两边也不要糊得太光滑，以免妨碍透水。
    精选种子，严格消毒
    播种之前，种子要经过一系列的处理。首先是晒种。晒种的作用，是促进出芽整齐粗壮，增强种子生活力，浸种时吸水也快。暴晒时间以二至三天为宜，晒时要摊得薄，翻动勤，使每粒谷都能接触到阳光。
    其次是选种。通过风筛、筛选、黄泥水选等几次精选，达到无秕子、无杂质、无半米。这些东西若不选出来，播种后半米谷不能出芽就会在田中腐烂，引起烂秧。秕子在田中也要繁殖，影响秧苗生长。
    第三，种子消毒。早粳稻种常带有稻热病菌，应当用福尔马林闷种。办法是一斤药水兑水五十斤，喷洒在四百至五百斤谷种上，密闭三小时；早籼稻应全部用1％的石灰水浸种四十八小时（两天两夜），种子处理后，都要用清水洗净，然后浸种或催芽。
    第四，种浸透，匀催芽。早粳一般浸种三天三夜，早籼一般浸二天二夜，使谷种吸足其重量的25％的水分，就算浸透了。催芽要十分细致，要密切注意温度，严防烧芽。催芽时要保持温度在摄氏三十至三十五度之间，并勤翻动，使发芽整齐，长短一致。芽长一至二分，摊开散热后，即可抢晴播种；如遇天气突变，已催了芽而又不能下田，应薄薄的摊开，注意翻动，俟天晴后播种。
    过好五关
    1、早。早稻播种，应适时偏早，以利早插早熟，二季晚稻早栽。由于3月份温度较低，气候变化大，应掌握寒潮规律，抢晴播种，把浸种催芽时间，安排在寒潮风雨期中，等催芽结束，天气已晴，即可抢住几个晴天播种，便于种子扎根立针，以免造成损失。早稻播种还要根据品种特性，本田插秧先后，及插秧的劳力多少，进行分期分批下秧，不能一次下，插不及造成老苗减产。
    2、密。今年早稻面积扩大，插秧密度增加，因之每亩用种量也由去年二十多斤增加到四十至八十斤，为了培育充足的秧苗，除了扩大一部分秧田外，还必须增加每亩秧田的播种量。
    3、匀。匀播是秧苗壮、齐、全的基础，要想尽一切办法做到匀播，使每一根苗有一定的营养面积，生长齐整一致。如按每斤谷种出苗一万四千株，每亩秧田有六十万平方寸，秧田利用率以85％计算，每亩播四百斤，每平方也只有十一点二株，根据这个标准来要求匀播，一般是可做到的。怎样才能播匀呢？首先要选有播种经验的人来播，或在播种前，进行播种技术训练；其次是按秧厢面积，分厢秤种，把用种量固定下来，使播种人心中有数；第三在播种时采用“先稀、后补、三填空”的办法，达到真正的匀。
    4、壮。播种后要紧接着加强秧田管理，及时除草扯皮，提早追肥培育壮苗，并密切注意虫害发生情况，在秧田打“六六六”一至二次防虫；在气候有变化时，注意保温防冻，做好了这一系列的工作，就圆满的完成了育秧的任务。
    5、嫩。插嫩秧回青快，分蘖早，成熟也可略早，又能错开劳力，特别是播种密度大，插秧面积大的情况下，提早插嫩秧，更有其重要意义。因之只要秧苗能插就抢早插秧，不要等秧长到很高，秧龄达到三十天以上才插，以致错过了时机。早插的秧，耖口肥应施重点。在寒潮正来时，暂时躲开不插；已插的要灌水保温，减少本田死苗。
