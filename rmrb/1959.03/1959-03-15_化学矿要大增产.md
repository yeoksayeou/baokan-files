    Chemical Ores Must Greatly Increase Production
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    This year, the production of basic chemical industries and chemical fertilizer industries will have a large increase. Therefore, the production of chemical ores must also have a corresponding great leap forward. In particular, the production of major chemical ores (pyrite, phosphate rock, etc.) must, while ensuring quality, increase the output by more than double that of 1958 in order to meet the needs.
    To develop chemical ores at high speed, accelerating the construction and expansion of large-scale mines and striving to put them into production as soon as possible is a most basic measure. This year, there are more new construction and expansion projects for chemical ores. A considerable amount of the annual production task of major chemical ores is to be undertaken by these new and expanded projects being put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule. Therefore, the relevant departments' arrangements for the new construction and expansion projects of chemical ores this year should, in the spirit of coordinating all the activities of the nation like pieces in a chess game, distinguish between primary and secondary, arrange the order, and concentrate the use of manpower and material resources to complete them batch by batch. First complete those projects that are most urgently needed and have the best construction conditions. For projects that have already started new construction and expansion, implement the spirit of self-reliance, accelerate the construction speed, shorten the construction period, and ensure quality through large-scale mass movements, and strive to put them into production and play a role as soon as possible. The units responsible for new construction and expansion must also pay close attention to the finishing touches. These projects do not require much manpower, materials, or equipment, and as long as they can be seized tightly, they can be put into production quickly. However, if they are not seized tightly, they can easily be delayed because the closer the project is to completion, the more complicated things become, and it is easy to be overlooked and delayed, or hastily completed with poor quality, which will prevent normal production. Therefore, all finishing touches must be carefully inspected and specific measures taken to ensure smooth commissioning.
    Giving full play to the production role of existing large-scale chemical ore mines is an important measure to ensure that the output of major chemical ores doubles. Although a considerable amount of this year's production task of major chemical ores is to be undertaken by new construction and expansion projects, ensuring the normal supply of chemical ores still depends on the production of existing mines. Especially in the first half of the year, when new construction and expansion projects cannot be put into production on a large scale, almost all of the chemical ore production task must be supplied by existing production mines. From the current situation, the production capacity of each mine is relatively large, but the transportation capacity is very tight. Therefore, the current central issue should be to actively find ways to solve the transportation problem. Solving the transportation problem should start from two aspects: technical revolution and strengthening cooperation. In-mine transportation and short-distance transportation should be solved by mobilizing the masses, reforming transportation tools, and giving full play to the existing transportation capacity. As for external railway and waterway transportation, each mine should actively and proactively establish cooperative relations with the transportation departments, arrange transportation plans, so that chemical ores can not only be produced in large quantities, but also be transported to the users in a timely manner. After the transportation capacity is resolved, the center of the technical revolution should be to improve mining methods, and drive the leap forward of all work in the entire mine.
    In order to meet the needs of the development of basic chemical industries and chemical fertilizer industries, it is necessary to not only focus on the new construction and production of large mines, but also vigorously develop the production of "small-scale indigenous" and "small-scale modern" chemical ores, combining the concentrated mass production of chemical ores with the decentralized small-scale production. Chemical ore production can fully develop small and scattered chemical ore resources, take materials locally, meet the needs of chemical industrial production; and the production technology and equipment of small chemical ore mines are relatively simple, so they can be "launched" first, mining and prospecting simultaneously, and then expand mining after clarifying the resources, to create conditions for the construction of regular mines. When mining chemical ores by indigenous methods, it is necessary to pay attention to saving mineral resources and protecting mineral resources. It is necessary to study mining methods and strive to extract all mineral resources.
    In order to ensure the high-speed development of chemical ores, geological exploration work must also keep up accordingly. In the geological exploration work of chemical ores, it is first necessary to find large-scale chemical ore resources, because large-scale chemical ores are the base for the raw material supply of basic chemical industries and chemical fertilizer industries. Whether large-scale mine resources can be guaranteed will directly affect the development of basic chemical industries and chemical fertilizer industries. In the work of exploring large-scale chemical ores, in addition to looking for new mineral resources around existing mines to meet the needs of these mines for continued expansion, it is also necessary to strengthen prospecting work and look for new mineral points, to actively create conditions for the establishment of new chemical ore production bases. While exploring large-scale chemical ores, it is also necessary to grasp more small-scale chemical ore resources with less reserves to meet the needs of small-scale mine development.
    Expanding the variety of chemical ore resources is an urgent requirement for the multi-variety development of the chemical industry. For example, the inorganic salt industry requires many varieties of chemical ores, and some varieties have not yet been resolved. With the development of the chemical industry, more requirements will be put forward in the future. Therefore, the geological exploration work of chemical ores, while vigorously searching for new mineral resources, should strive to discover and explore new varieties of chemical ores, to provide China's chemical industry development with new mineral resources with greater output and more varieties.

    化学矿要大增产
    本报评论员
    今年基本化学工业和化学肥料工业的生产将有很大的增长，因此要求化学矿的生产也要相应地来一个大跃进。特别是主要的化学矿（黄铁矿、磷矿等）的生产，必须在保证质量的条件下，使产量比1958年提高一倍以上，才能适应需要。
    要想高速度地发展化学矿，加速大型矿山的新建和扩建，力争尽快地投入生产，是一项最基本的措施。今年化学矿的新建和扩建工程比较多。全年主要化学矿的生产任务，有相当数量是依靠这些新建和扩建项目按期或提前投入生产来承担的。因此，有关部门对今年化学矿的新建和扩建工程的安排，应根据全国一盘棋的精神，分清主次，排好顺序，集中使用人力和物力，一批一批的去完成。首先完成那些最急需建设条件又最好的工程，已经开始新建和扩建的工程，要贯彻自力更生的精神，通过大搞群众运动，加快建设速度，缩短建设工期，保证质量，争取早日投入生产，发挥作用。新建和扩建的单位，还必须十分注意扫尾工程，这些工程所需要的人力、材料、设备都不多了，只要能够抓紧，很快就可以投入生产；可是如果不抓紧，很容易拖延下去，因为工程愈接近竣工，愈是千头万绪，而且容易被人忽视而延误竣工，或者草率竣工，质量不好，都不能正常生产。因此，对一切扫尾工程必须详加检查，采取具体措施，保证顺利投入生产。
    充分发挥现有化学矿大型矿山生产的作用，是保证主要化学矿产量翻一番的重要措施。今年主要化学矿的生产任务，虽有相当数量要由新建和扩建工程来承担，但是保证化学矿正常的供应，还是要依靠现有的矿山生产，特别是上半年新建和扩建工程还不能大批投入生产，化学矿的生产任务，几乎全部要由现有生产矿山来供应。从目前的情况来看，各矿山的生产能力较大，但运输力量十分紧张，因此，目前的中心问题应该积极设法解决运输问题。解决运输问题应该从两方面着手，一是技术革命，一是加强协作。矿内运输和短途运输，要通过发动群众，改革运输工具，充分发挥现有的运输能力来解决。至于外部的铁路和水路运输，各矿山要积极主动，和交通运输部门建立协作关系，安排好运输计划，使化学矿不但能够大量生产出来，而且能够及时地运送到使用部门去。在解决了运输能力以后，技术革命的中心就应该是改进采矿方法，带动整个矿山一切工作的跃进。
    为了适应基本化学工业和化学肥料工业发展的需要，既要抓好大矿场的新建和生产，也要大力发展“小土”和“小洋”化学矿的生产，把化学矿集中的大量生产和分散的小量生产结合起来。化学矿生产，可以充分开发量小而分散的化学矿资源，就地取材，满足化学工业生产的需要；而且小型化学矿的生产技术与设备比较简易，可以先“上马”，边采边探，弄清资源后再扩大开采，为建设正规矿山创造条件。用土法开采化学矿，必须注意节约矿源，爱护矿源。要研究采矿方法，争取把矿产资源全部拿出来。
    为了保证化学矿的高速发展，地质勘探工作也必须相应地跟上去。在化学矿地质勘探工作中，首先要寻找大规模化学矿的资源，因为大型化学矿是基本化学工业和化学肥料工业原料供应的基地，大型矿山资源能否得到保证，将直接影响基本化学工业和化学肥料工业的发展。在勘探大规模化学矿的工作中，除了在现有矿山周围寻找新的矿源，满足这些矿山继续扩建需要之外，还必须加强普查工作，寻找新矿点，为建立新的化学矿生产基地积极创造条件。在勘探大规模化学矿的同时，也要多多的掌握一些储量较少的小型化学矿资源。满足小型矿山开采的需要。
    扩大化学矿资源的品种，是化学工业多品种发展的迫切要求，如无机盐工业所需要的化学矿的品种很多，目前有些品种我们还没有得到解决。随着化学工业的发展，今后还会提出更多的要求，因此，化学矿的地质勘探工作，在大力寻找新矿源的同时，应该努力发现和勘探化学矿的新品种，为我国化学工业发展提供产量更大品种更多的新的矿产资源。
