    Grand Assembly of Advanced Workers
    ——A Sideline Report on the Mongolian Advanced Producers Conference
    By Our Correspondent Féng Yè
    Last March, the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party declared that the Mongolian People's Republic had developed from a backward, purely pastoral country into an agricultural-pastoral-industrial country. Over the past year, Mongolia's industry has further developed. In 1958, the annual industrial production plan was fulfilled by 103.8%, and the total industrial output increased by 16.1% compared with 1957, worth 57.5 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency). In the same year, Mongolia built many new industrial and mining enterprises: the largest Nalaikha Coal Mine shaft in the country was officially put into production; the "Friendship Brick Factory" with an annual output of 25 million bricks was completed; and the first large-scale dairy processing plant was put into production. In addition, new industrial sectors that Mongolia did not have in the past, such as flour mills and glass factories, were also built successively last year.
    With the development of industry, Mongolia's emerging working class is further growing. Before the victory of the revolution, Mongolia did not have its own working class. After the founding of the republic, with the state's industry, the working class grew day by day. In 1958, the number of employees in various factories and mines increased by 12.4% compared to the previous year. Now, whether in factories and mines, or in transportation, postal and telecommunications, and construction departments, Mongolian workers are gradually mastering various new scientific technologies, completing production tasks excellently, and continuously producing advanced figures.
    Recently, the "Second Mongolian Advanced Producers Conference" held in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, brought together advanced figures from factories, mines, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and construction departments, and reviewed their outstanding achievements on various production fronts.
    The advanced deeds of the miners attending the conference attracted the audience. Coal miner Mén Sū’ěr mined 115 tons of coal every day (six hours), completing nine to ten days of mining tasks. Workers at the East Bayan Oil Plant completed 107.8% of the production plan in 1958, saving more than 570,000 Tugriks. Oil worker Chágān Dào’ěrjí and others successfully trial-produced automatic oil loading equipment, improving labor efficiency by 42%.
    Mongolian construction workers have also achieved great success. The State Construction Committee completed 105% of the annual construction plan for 1958. In Ulaanbaatar, new buildings are springing up like mushrooms after rain. In 1958, the newly built industrial, mining, agricultural, pastoral, and employee housing totaled 94,000 square meters, which is 16% more than the construction area during Mongolia's first five-year plan. If only the residential area is calculated, then the residential area completed in one year is equal to 4.5 times the area built during the first five-year plan. Employees moved into houses with heating and other equipment one after another, spending Mongolia's long and severe winter warmly.
    In the construction worker ranks, there are many famous advanced workers. Lāmùsūlún, a bricklayer who won the Choibalsan Prize in 1958, and his production team learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, mastered new production technologies, and broke production records three times in a year. In summer, the bricklaying volume of this group was more than 40,000 to 50,000 bricks per shift (eight hours), and the bricklaying volume in winter was more than 22,000 bricks, completing more than 1,200% of the prescribed target, saving the country more than 10,000 Tugriks per shift. The advanced example of Lāmùsūlún's team encouraged other bricklayers. The youth league member Cáo Gāo bricklaying team launched a friendly competition with Lāmùsūlún's team, and as a result, it also broke more than 1,100% of the target. Cáo Gāo received Mongolia's highest medal—the Sukhbaatar Medal—at this conference.
    On the transportation front, railway workers and automobile workers have completed very difficult and glorious tasks. On Mongolia's vast grasslands, herders live scattered, and transportation is an important tool to strengthen urban-rural ties and meet the needs of people's lives. The railway trunk line spanning the north and south of Mongolia not only promotes the exchange of materials within the country, but also becomes an important line connecting the Soviet Union and China. Over the past year, railway workers have completed the transportation plan well, and over-fulfilled the savings plan in an exemplary manner. Railway employees also proposed an initiative to call on workers across the country to participate in physical labor, which was warmly responded to by workers in various places, and was made a resolution by the Party and the government and implemented as a system.
    Car drivers drive cars day and night on the grassland. They set off a competition upsurge for safe driving. Driver Lǔbùsāng Sāngbù was the first to drive safely for 500,000 kilometers and was awarded the title of "Labor Hero" of the Republic last year. This hero is a driver in the transportation department of the Gobi-Altai Province. His car has safely passed countless Gobi deserts and grasslands. Many others have completed the target of 300,000 kilometers and 400,000 kilometers of safe driving. One hundred and thirty-five people across the country have completed the target of 100,000 kilometers of safe driving.
    On the day the Advanced Workers Conference ended, the Presidium of the Mongolian Great People's Hural awarded a group of outstanding advanced producers. Shā Lābù, an old worker in the Industrial Union Factory, was awarded the title of "Labor Hero" of the Republic.
    We met Shā Lābù at the Industrial Union Factory. This "Labor Hero" was originally an ordinary herder. He came to the Industrial Union Factory fifteen years ago, learned the technology, and quickly became a skilled worker. For the past fifteen years, he has been undertaking relatively heavy work. During the first and second five-year plans, he completed more than nineteen years of production quotas.
    People praised Shā Lābù as a person who dedicated all his wisdom and strength to the country. He is a versatile person who has mastered the operation methods of more than a dozen processes in the workshop. He also taught his technology to later workers. With his help, 36 people quickly mastered the technology, of whom 28 became advanced workers.
    The Advanced Workers Conference successfully closed in mid-March. The advanced producers issued a loud initiative at the closing meeting, calling on the working class across the country to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule and over-fulfill the plan, and requiring all production departments to continue to carry out socialist labor competitions and establish socialist labor teams. There is no doubt that this initiative will be warmly responded to by workers across the country, accelerating Mongolia's socialist construction.
    This year is the second year of Mongolia's three-year plan, and it is a year of decisive significance. After the completion of the three-year plan, the face of Mongolia will be further changed. Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, pointed out to the representatives at this meeting the inspiring development prospects. He said that the Mongolian Party and government have begun to formulate the draft of the five-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture from 1961 to 1965. This plan will more rapidly develop Mongolia's productivity. All sectors of the national economy will gradually implement electrification. In the new five-year plan, the total industrial output will increase by 60% compared to the three-year plan. All investment will increase to three times the total investment of the three-year plan. This beautiful prospect further aroused the labor enthusiasm of the people across the country, and they will move forward along the happy road guided by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

    先进工人大会师
    ——蒙古先进生产者会议侧记
    本报记者　逢烨
    去年3月，蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会曾经宣布，蒙古人民共和国已经从一个过去落后的纯牧业国发展成为农牧业—工业国了。一年来，蒙古的工业又有了进一步的发展。1958年全年完成了工业生产计划的103.8％，工业总产量比1957年增加了16.1％，价值五千七百五十万图格里克（蒙币）。这一年，蒙古又建成了许多新的工矿企业：全国最大的那莱河煤矿竖井正式投入生产；一个年产二千五百万块红砖的“友谊砖瓦厂”完工了；第一个大型的乳品加工厂投入生产了。此外，蒙古过去没有的工业部门如面粉加工厂、玻璃厂等也在去年内相继建成了。
    随着工业的发展，蒙古新兴的工人阶级正在进一步成长。在革命胜利以前，蒙古是没有自己的工人阶级的。共和国成立后，有了国家的工业，工人阶级才一天天成长起来。1958年，各厂矿的职工人数又比上一年增加了12.4％。现在，无论在厂矿企业，或者在交通运输、邮电、建筑部门，蒙古工人都逐步掌握了各种新的科学技术，出色地完成生产任务，同时不断地涌现出先进人物。
    最近，在蒙古首都乌兰巴托召开的“蒙古第二届先进生产者大会”，集中了工厂、矿山、交通、邮电和建筑部门的先进人物，检阅了他们在各个生产战线上的出色的成绩。
    参加大会的矿工们的先进事迹，吸引了到会的人们。煤矿工人门苏尔每天（六小时）采煤一百一十五吨，完成了九天到十天的采煤任务。东白音石油厂工人1958年完成了生产计划的107.8％，节约资金五十七万多图格里克。石油工人查干道尔吉等人，试制成功自动的装油设备，提高劳动效率42％。
    蒙古建筑工人也获得巨大的成就。国家建筑委员会完成了1958年全年建筑计划的105％。在乌兰巴托，新建筑像雨后春笋一样上升起来。1958年，新建的工矿业、农牧业建筑和职工住宅共达九万四千平方公尺，比蒙古第一个五年计划期间的建筑面积还多16％。如果光计算住宅面积的话，那么一年来完工的住宅面积，等于第一个五年计划期间修建的四点五倍。职工们相继搬进了有暖气等设备的房子里，暖暖和和地度过蒙古漫长的严冬季节。
    建筑工人队伍里，有许多著名的先进工人。1958年荣获乔巴山奖金的砌砖工人拉木苏伦和他的生产小组，学习了苏联的先进经验，掌握了新的生产技术，在一年内曾三次突破生产纪录。这个小组夏天每班（八小时）的砌砖量为四万多块到五万多块，冬天的砌砖量两万两千多块，完成规定指标的百分之一千二百多，每班为国家节约资金一万多图格里克。拉木苏伦小组的先进事例鼓舞了其他砌砖工人，青年团员曹高砌砖小组，向拉木苏伦小组开展了友谊竞赛，结果也突破了百分之一千多的指标。曹高在这次会上得到了蒙古的最高勋章——苏赫巴托尔勋章。
    在交通运输战线上，铁路工人和汽车工人完成了十分艰巨而又光荣的任务。在蒙古广阔的草原上，牧民居住分散，交通运输是加强城乡联系、满足人民生活需要的重要工具。横跨蒙古南北的铁路干线，不仅促进了本国内的物资交流，同时成为连系苏中两国间的重要线路之一。一年来，铁路工人很好地完成了运输计划，模范地超额完成了节约计划。铁路职工还提出号召全国职工参加体力劳动的倡议，得到各地职工的热烈响应，并且经党和政府作出决议，作为一项制度来实行了。
    汽车司机日夜驾驶汽车在草原上奔驰。他们掀起了一个安全行车的竞赛热潮。司机鲁布桑桑布第一个安全行车五十万公里，去年荣获了共和国的“劳动英雄”称号。这位英雄是戈壁阿尔泰省运输部门的司机，他的汽车安全地驶过无数的戈壁和草原。还有许多人完成安全行车三十万公里、四十万公里的指标。全国有一百三十五人完成安全行车十万公里的指标。
    这次先进工人会师大会结束的那天，蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团给予一批出色的先进生产者奖励。工业联合工厂的老工人沙拉布荣获了共和国“劳动英雄”的称号。
    我们曾经在工业联合工厂会见沙拉布。这位“劳动英雄”原来是一位普通牧民，十五年前到了工业联合工厂，学会了技术，很快成为一个熟练工人。十五年来，他一直担负着比较繁重的工作。在第一个和第二个五年计划期间，他完成了十九年多的生产定额。
    人们称赞沙拉布是为国家献出一切智慧和力量的人。他是一位多面手，掌握了车间十多个工序的操作方法。他还把自己的技术教给后来的工人，在他的帮助下，有三十六人很快掌握了技术，其中，二十八人成为先进工作者。
    先进工人会师大会在3月中旬胜利闭幕。先进生产者们在闭幕会上发出了响亮的倡议，要求全国工人阶级提前和超额完成三年计划，要求各生产部门继续开展社会主义劳动竞赛，建立社会主义劳动队。毫无疑问，这个倡议将会得到全国工人的热烈响应，加速蒙古的社会主义建设。
    今年是蒙古三年计划的第二年，是有决定性意义的一年。三年计划完成后，将进一步改变蒙古的面貌。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席泽登巴尔在这次会上向代表们指出了鼓舞人心的发展远景。他说，蒙古党和政府已在开始制订1961—1965年发展国民经济和文化的五年计划草案，这个计划将更加迅速地发展蒙古的生产力，国民经济各部门将逐步实行电气化，在新的五年计划内，工业总产量将比三年计划增加60％。全部投资将比三年计划的总投资增加到三倍。这一美好远景，更加激起全国人民的劳动热情，他们将沿着蒙古人民革命党指引的幸福大道，迈步前进。（附图片）
