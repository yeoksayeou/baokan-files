Shaanxi North is good, Shaanxi North is good,
Shaanxi North is full of treasures,
Dig up the treasure trove to get gold and silver,
Thousands of cave dwellings cannot hold it all.

Shaanxi North is good, Shaanxi North is good,
Every gully and ditch is a granary,
Silver light shines all over the mountains,
Rice is planted in every river and valley.

Shaanxi North is good, Shaanxi North is good,
Green robes are worn all over the mountains and fields,
Pine and cypress trees on distant high mountains,
Pear and apricot trees on nearby low mountains.

Shaanxi North is good, Shaanxi North is good,
Green grass grows in thousands of miles of pasture,
Cattle, sheep, and mules are lined up,
Each one is fat and round.

Shaanxi North is good, Shaanxi North is good,
Shaanxi North has a new look everywhere,
The bare ridges and barren mountains have all changed,
Who says it's not as good as the South of the Yangtze River!

    陕北好陕北好来陕北好，陕北遍地都是宝，挖开宝库取金银，千万窑洞装不了。陕北好来陕北好，沟沟洼洼粮食窖，山上山下银光闪，川川道道栽水稻。陕北好来陕北好，满山遍野穿绿袍，远山高山松柏树，近山低山梨杏桃。陕北好来陕北好，千里牧场长青草，牛羊骡马摆成行，个个肥胖滚圆膘。陕北好来陕北好，陕北处处新容貌，秃岭荒山全改变，谁说不如江南好！
