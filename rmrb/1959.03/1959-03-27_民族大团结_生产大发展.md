The one million eight hundred thousand people of all nationalities in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan, under the leadership of the Party, have united as one and achieved tremendous success in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Especially in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the economic and cultural construction of the autonomous prefecture showed an even more prosperous and leaping situation. In terms of agricultural production, many unprecedented miracles were created. The 135 people's communes, reorganized from 3,897 agricultural production cooperatives in the prefecture's rural areas, have demonstrated their superiority in production, distribution, ideology, and life. In this way, the social outlook of the autonomous prefecture and the spiritual outlook of the people of all nationalities have once again undergone changes in a very broad scope and to a very profound extent. Socialist ethnic relations have been further formed and are developing day by day. This has created extremely favorable conditions for striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, for thoroughly changing the backward appearance of the autonomous prefecture, and for accelerating socialist construction.

How do we implement the Party's policies and instructions and lead the people of all nationalities to achieve an all-round Great Leap Forward? Our experience is:

We must strengthen the Party's leadership, conscientiously implement the Party's ethnic policies, and lead the masses to victoriously conduct the struggle between the two roads on all fronts. As early as 1952, the minority nationalities in the Xiangxi area realized regional ethnic autonomy. Before and after this, a series of democratic reforms and socialist transformations were carried out, eliminating the systems of class exploitation and ethnic oppression. At the same time, the people of all nationalities were led to constantly criticize Han chauvinism and local nationalism, further eliminating the ethnic estrangement left over from history, and making ethnic unity possess new content and a new foundation. Especially after the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people of all nationalities was further strengthened; the people of all nationalities more deeply realized that without the Party's leadership, there would be no thorough liberation of the minority nationalities, and no real equality, happiness, and prosperity. Therefore, now they often cannot help singing: "Great unity and great collaboration, thinking of the benefactor, sing folk songs, singing songs do not forget the Communist Party, following the Party will bring lasting happiness." This is the most affectionate and sincere expression of the people of all nationalities towards the Party.

Actively developing the economy of minority nationality areas is the material foundation for realizing ethnic unity, ethnic development, and prosperity. Due to various historical reasons, minority nationality areas appear poorer and more backward. After the change in the ownership of the means of production, the people of all nationalities urgently demanded to change this economically backward situation and achieve de facto equality among all nationalities. We made our best efforts to realize this wish together with the people of all nationalities, and led the masses to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production and various basic construction projects. First of all, we armed the masses ideologically, leading them to criticize "special theory," "backward theory," "condition-only theory," and all right-leaning and passive thoughts that sit and wait for relief without practicing self-reliance. In agricultural production, from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, we focused on water conservancy. After a winter and spring of hard work, we began to change the situation of suffering from drought every year in history; secondly, we also conscientiously implemented various advanced production increase technologies and experiences, such as early sowing, strong seedlings, deep plowing, close planting, and selection of improved varieties in grain production; "four diligence and eight haves" in terms of fertilizer accumulation, and so on. Therefore, in 1958, an unprecedented bumper harvest was obtained in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, with grain as the main focus. The total grain output of the prefecture increased by 70% compared with the increased production of 1957. The total output value of agricultural and sideline industries reached 300 million yuan, an increase of 78% compared with 1957. In industrial production, the central government's policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture was implemented. The prefecture produced 20,000 tons of iron, 4,430 tons of steel, and 400,000 tons of coal throughout the year, and equipped 180 lathes. At the same time, light industry, mainly processing industry, was vigorously developed. A total of 10,196 large and small factories (sites) were established in the prefecture. The total industrial output value reached more than 83 million yuan, an increase of 4.4 times compared with 1957, accounting for 25% of the total industrial and agricultural output value (only 6.51% in 1952). The autonomous prefecture has trained nearly 10,000 minority nationality workers, which not only strengthened various technical forces, but also made the prefecture have its first minority nationality working class. These have created conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification in the future.

Due to the Great Leap Forward and bumper harvests in industrial and agricultural production, a reliable material and ideological foundation was created. Thus, it became possible to have a situation of full-scale leap forward on all fronts such as transportation, culture, education, health, finance, and trade. The formerly blocked transportation situation has been further changed, and all ten counties have now been connected by highways. Great achievements have been made in literacy work, and 95% of school-age children have entered school. The autonomous prefecture has established its first university, Jishou University, as well as specialized schools in agriculture and health. The health level of the people has been greatly improved, and diseases that seriously endanger people's health, such as malaria, have begun to be conquered. The people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, and universal arming of the people has been realized.

All of these have promoted profound changes in the spiritual outlook of the people of all nationalities. The communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do has become the standard for people to encourage and train themselves. "Learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced" has become a common social atmosphere. "Daring to roll on the back of a fierce tiger, daring to pull tendons from a vicious dragon" is the most appropriate portrayal of the revolutionary heroism of the people of all nationalities.

We must cultivate and rely on the backbone elements with communist ideological consciousness among the minority nationalities. In various movements and struggles, through the Party's active education and training, more than 40,000 activists of all nationalities have emerged. More than 7,200 of the most outstanding among them have been admitted into the Party (more than 3,700 Tujia people and more than 3,400 Miao people). More than 3,600 minority nationality cadres with communist awareness and deeply loved by the people of all nationalities have been trained and promoted (1,896 Tujia people and 1,749 Miao people), undertaking various specific and leadership work in Party and state organs and enterprises. At the same time, the Communist Youth League organization has also been developed among young people. The vast majority of these minority nationality cadres have demonstrated the noble quality of wholeheartedly serving the people in implementing the Party's policies, contacting the masses, and completing various work tasks, and are often praised by the people as "good cadres of Chairman Mao." It should also be pointed out here that many Han cadres working in the autonomous prefecture are generally hardworking, thorough, and selfless in serving the people of all nationalities, and have been deeply supported and loved by the vast masses.

It is entirely foreseeable that after the people's commune system, it will open up broad avenues for further comprehensively developing and prospering the economic and cultural undertakings of minority nationalities; it will provide a more favorable situation and conditions for building socialism at high speed and striving to thoroughly change the face of the autonomous prefecture in the shortest possible time.

In the future, the important task of the people of all nationalities in the autonomous prefecture is to continue to strengthen ethnic unity under the leadership of the Party and under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line, better implement the Party's ethnic policies, and build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way; and actively create conditions for the future transition to communism. At present, according to the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we should concentrate our efforts to consolidate and rectify the organization of the people's communes, implement the central government's instructions on "walking on two legs" in all our work, and achieve a greater leap forward in 1959.

We firmly believe that our wishes and goals will surely be realized.

    民族大团结  生产大发展
    中共湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州地方委员会第一书记  齐寿良
    湘西土家族苗族自治州一百八十万各民族人民，在党的领导下，团结一致，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，都取得了巨大的成绩。特别是在大跃进的1958年，自治州的经济文化建设事业，更加出现了一个兴旺蓬勃的跃进局面。在农业生产方面，创造了不少前无古人的奇迹。全州农村中，由三千八百九十七个农业生产合作社改组成的一百三十五个人民公社，已经在生产、分配、思想和生活等方面，显示了优越性。这样，自治州社会面貌和各民族人民的精神面貌，就在极广泛的范围内和极深刻的程度上，再一次发生了变化。社会主义的民族关系进一步形成；并且正在日益发展。这就为争取今年更大更好更全面的跃进，为彻底改变自治州的落后面貌，为加速社会主义建设，创造了极有利的条件。
    我们是怎样贯彻执行党的方针政策和指示，领导各族人民实现全面大跃进的呢？我们的体会是：
    必须加强党的领导，认真贯彻党的民族政策，在一切战线上领导群众胜利地进行两条道路的斗争。早在1952年，湘西地区的少数民族就实现了民族的区域自治，在这前后，还通过一系列的民主改革和社会主义改造，消灭了阶级剥削和民族压迫制度。同时，又领导了各民族人民不断地批判了大民族主义和地方民族主义，进一步消除了历史上遗留的民族隔阂，使民族团结具备了新的内容和基础。特别是经过1957年的反右派斗争，进一步密切了党和各民族人民的血肉关系；各民族人民更加深刻地体会到，没有党的领导就没有少数民族彻底的翻身，就没有真正的平等和幸福繁荣。因此，现在他们常常情不自禁地唱道：“大团结大协作，想起恩人唱山歌，唱歌不忘共产党，跟着党走幸福长。”这就是各民族人民同党的最深情最诚挚的表现。
    积极发展少数民族地区的经济，是实现民族团结、民族发展和繁荣的物质基础。由于种种历史上的原因，少数民族地区显得更穷更白。在生产资料所有制改变以后，各民族人民就迫切要求改变这种经济上的落后面貌，达到各民族间事实上的平等。我们以最大的努力同各族人民一道实现了这种愿望，领导群众大力发展了工农业生产和各项生产基本建设。首先在思想上武装群众，领导群众批判了“特殊论”、“落后论”、“唯条件论”和坐等救济不实行自力更生的一切右倾消极思想。我们在农业生产上，从1957年冬到1958年春，就大抓水利，经过苦战一冬春，就开始改变了历史上年年遭受旱灾的局面；其次，还认真贯彻了各种先进的增产技术和经验，如粮食生产上的早播、壮秧、深耕、密植、选用良种；积肥方面的“四勤八有”等等。因此，1958年就获得了以粮食为主的农林牧副渔各项生产的空前丰收。全州粮食总产量比增产的1957年还增加70％。农副业总产值达到三亿元，比1957年增长78％。在工业生产上，执行了中央关于工农业同时并举的方针，全州全年产铁二万吨，钢四千四百三十吨，煤四十万吨，装备车床一百八十台，同时大力发展了以加工工业为主的轻工业，全州共建立大小工厂（场）达一万零一百九十六座。工业总产值达到八千三百多万元，比1957年增加四点四倍，占工农业总产值的25％（1952年只占6.51％）。自治州已经培养了近万名的少数民族工人，不仅壮大了各种技术力量；而且使本州内第一次有了少数民族的工人阶级队伍。这些都为今后实现农业机械化电气化，创造了条件。
    由于工农业生产的大跃进大丰收，创造了可靠的物质基础和思想基础，于是就有可能出现一个交通、文教卫生、财经贸易等各个战线万马奔腾，全面跃进的局面。过去交通闭塞的面目已经进一步改变，十个县已经县县通公路。扫盲工作已经获得很大的成绩，适龄儿童已有95％的人入了学，自治州已经建立第一所高等学校——吉首大学，以及农业、卫生等专科学校。人民群众的健康水平大大提高，严重危害人民健康的疾病如疟疾等，开始被人们降服了。人民民主专政进一步巩固，实现了全民武装等等。
    所有这些，都促进了各民族人民精神面貌的深刻变化，敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，成为人们勉励自己、锻炼自己的标准。“学先进、赶先进、超先进”已成为普遍的社会风气，“猛虎背上敢打滚，恶龙身上敢抽筋”，正是各族人民的革命英雄主义气概的最恰当的写照。
    必须培养和依靠少数民族中的具有共产主义思想觉悟的骨干。在各项运动和斗争中，经过党的积极教育培养，已涌现出四万多名各民族的积极分子，他们中的最优秀分子已经有七千二百多名被吸收到党内来（土家族三千七百多人，苗族三千四百多人），并且还培养提拔了具有共产主义觉悟和深受各民族人民爱戴的少数民族干部三千六百多人（土家族一千八百九十六人，苗族一千七百四十九人），在党和国家机关、企业单位中担负着各种具体工作和领导工作。同时，在青年中还发展了共青团的组织。这些少数民族干部，在执行党的方针政策，联系群众，完成各项工作任务中，绝大多数都表现了忠心耿耿为人民服务的高贵品质，常被人民群众誉为“毛主席的好干部”。这里应该同时指出的是：许多在自治州工作的汉族干部，一般都是艰苦深入、任劳任怨，全心全意地为各民族人民服务的，并已深为广大群众所拥护和爱戴。
    完全可以预料，在人民公社化之后，将为进一步全面地发展和繁荣少数民族的经济和文化事业，开辟广阔的道路；将为高速度地建设社会主义，争取在最短期间内彻底改变自治州面貌，提供更加有利的形势和条件。
    今后，自治州各民族人民的重要任务就是：继续在党的领导下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，更好地贯彻执行党的民族政策，进一步加强民族团结，多快好省地建设社会主义；并为将来过渡到共产主义积极创造条件。而在当前，应该根据党的八届六中全会的决议，集中力量，巩固整顿人民公社的组织，在各项工作中执行中央关于“用两条腿走路”的指示，实现1959年更大的跃进。
    我们深信：我们的愿望和目的是一定能够实现的。
