    Living Canned Goods - Galapagos Tortoises
    Xiao Yuan

    If we open a map of South America, we can see the Galapagos Islands in the ocean five or six hundred miles west of the coast of Ecuador in the northwest direction of South America. The name is a transliteration of the Spanish word, originally the name of a kind of freshwater turtle. Why use the name of a turtle to call a group of islands? There is a certain reason for this.

    This group of islands is home to the largest living land turtle today—the Galapagos tortoise. This giant tortoise generally weighs four or five hundred catties (200-250kg). In 1835, the famous naturalist Darwin made a detailed investigation of these islands while circumnavigating the world on the warship "Beagle." The observations made during the investigation were closely related to the formation of the evolutionary thought on the biological world in his famous book "Origin of Species." Darwin was the first to observe and scientifically record this giant tortoise.

    As the name suggests, the Galapagos tortoise must be the "elephant" among turtles, with a body length of about two meters. These turtles feed on prickly cacti, and sometimes eat grass and wild fruits. The Galapagos Islands are located near the equator, and the year is divided into rainy and dry seasons instead of four seasons. During the rainy season, Galapagos tortoises forage on the plains at the foot of the mountains, and during the dry season, they go to the cloud-covered mountain peaks to seek food.

    Turtles have the characteristic of being able to survive for a long time without care or feeding, and the Galapagos tortoise is large and fleshy, so it has become a living canned food carried by seafarers during the dry season. At that time, there were no canned goods, and carrying Galapagos tortoises on board meant that fresh meat was often available to eat. The earliest were pirates in the nineteenth century, and later the sailors of whaling ships, who came here to catch hundreds of them for slaughter and consumption during the journey. Galapagos tortoises have a lot of oil in their bodies, and in the past, people often hunted them for oil. As a result, these Galapagos tortoises, which lived in secluded islands, could no longer live the carefree life they once had, especially with the arrival of mammals such as pigs, cats, dogs, and rabbits that had never existed on the island before. Some of these mammals forage for turtle eggs, while others compete with Galapagos tortoises for plants. All these reasons have caused the number of Galapagos tortoises to decline, and now they only survive on the largest island in the archipelago. If they are not strictly protected, they may become extinct in a few years.

    活罐头—象龟
    小元
    翻开南美洲地图，我们可以看见南美的西北方向厄瓜多尔海岸以西五、六百英里的海洋中，有一个名叫加拉巴哥斯的群岛。这个名字本是西班牙文的译音，原是一种淡水龟的名字。为什么用龟的名字来称呼一群海岛，原来是有一定缘由的。
    在这群海岛上生存着今日最大的陆生龟类——象龟，这种巨龟一般体重有四、五百斤。1835年著名的博物学者达尔文在乘“贝格尔号”军舰环游世界的时候，到这群岛上做过详细的考察。考察中所得对他有名的“物种起源”一书中关于生物界进化思想的形成，有密切的关系。关于这种巨龟首先作了观察与科学的记载的，就是达尔文。
    象龟顾名思义，必定是龟类中的“大象”，体长约两公尺。这种龟以生满针刺的仙人掌为食，有时也吃青草与野果。加拉巴哥斯群岛位于赤道附近，一年不分四季，只有雨季与旱季之别。雨季象龟寻食于山下平地，旱季就到云雾润泽的山巅求食。
    龟类都有长期不照管不饲养、照常存活的特点，而象龟又体大多肉，于是便成为旱期航海者随船携带的活罐头。当时没有罐头，而随船带有象龟便经常有鲜肉食用。最早是十九世纪的海盗，后来又是捕鲸船的水手们，来此成百捕捉而去，以供旅途中杀取食用。象龟体内油脂很多，以前也常有人捕杀取油。于是这种安居在与世隔绝的群岛上的象龟，便越来越不能过从前与世无争的生活，特别是随着人迹所至，出现了这个岛上从不曾有过的猪、猫、狗、兔子等哺乳动物以后，它的日子就更加不好过了。这些哺乳动物有的寻食龟蛋，有的则与象龟争食植物。所有这些原因，使象龟的数目日渐减少，现在只存活在群岛中最大的一个岛上，如不严加保护，若干年后可能绝种。
