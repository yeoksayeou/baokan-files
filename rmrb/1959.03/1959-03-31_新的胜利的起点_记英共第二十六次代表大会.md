　　A New Starting Point for Victory – On the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain
　　By our correspondents Pan Fei and Li Yichuan

    The four-day 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain concluded on March 30th. This congress prominently displayed the unity of the entire party and the boundless confidence of the vanguard of the British working class in their just cause. The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Gollan, said: This is the best congress held since the founding of the Communist Party of Great Britain.
    Two years ago, when the Communist Party of Great Britain held its 25th Congress, the British bourgeoisie predicted that the Communist Party of Great Britain, experiencing a "crisis," was about to "collapse" and "split" and that it would withdraw from the British political stage. The situation at the time was: the British ruling group used the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident to stir up a fierce and malicious anti-communist movement, and within the Communist Party of Great Britain, a small group of revisionists was indeed stirring up trouble. Two years have passed, and the bourgeoisie's "predictions" have not been realized, and they will never be realized. The 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain held the red flag of Marxism-Leninism even higher. Now, the bourgeoisie's propaganda machine is silent. They have admitted their failure.
    In the past two years, the ranks of the Communist Party of Great Britain have been consolidated and developed in the struggle. Around the time of the 25th Congress, the number of party members once decreased. Now, the Communist Party of Great Britain has increased its membership to more than 26,500. In the past five months, the Communist Party of Great Britain has admitted 3,500 new members. This reflects the broad masses' dissatisfaction with the Conservative Party, their disappointment with the Labour Party, and their support for and hope in the Communist Party. A delegate from Scotland told reporters: In a certain mining area, there were only four party members last year. The party led the struggle against the closure of the mine, and the party's influence quickly expanded. Now, this area has grown to twenty-five party members.
    In the past two years, the influence of the Communist Party of Great Britain in British political life has been growing. In the struggle to defend the interests of the working people and to defend peace, the Communist Party has put forward the most distinct program and carried out the most resolute struggle. The large-scale demonstration against American military bases organized by the Communist Party of Great Britain last year promoted the British peace movement and had a tremendous impact. The Communist Party of Great Britain led the struggle against layoffs, demanding wage increases, and opposing rent increases, becoming the defender of the vital interests of the British working people. The influence of the Communist Party can be seen from the fact that the Communist Party member, Penton, was recently elected as the General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers in the United Kingdom. Among the 700,000 miners in the United Kingdom, there are only more than 2,000 Communist Party members, but Penton received more than 200,000 miners' votes.
    The task of the 26th Congress was to summarize the experiences of the past two years and to deploy new struggles based on the new situation. As Gollan's report pointed out, one of the important reasons for the success was that the party carried out the struggle against revisionism and drew a clear line with social democratic ideas.
    This congress paid great attention to economic issues. The current situation is that the British bourgeoisie is shifting the burden of the crisis onto the working people. The congress put forward a program of action to defend the interests of the working people, demanding the launch of an anti-layoff struggle, striving for wage increases and shorter working hours; advocating reducing British military spending by one-half in order to use the saved funds to improve people's lives.
    The congress analyzed the current political situation. The congress pointed out that the Conservative Party cannot and cannot possibly put forward a program to solve Britain's problems, and the Labour Party's reformist policy has also completely failed with the end of the post-war "prosperity." A speech by Campbell, a member of the Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, exposed the essence of the Labour Party's right-wing policy. He said: The Labour Party right-wing believes that as long as it controls a few central institutions, it can continuously increase employment, production, and wages. "Unfortunately, the economic depression has tarnished this picture… The capitalists' profits are higher than at any time in the history of capitalism. All this nonsense is to weaken the working class's fighting spirit." Based on the analysis of the current situation in Britain, the congress particularly emphasized the necessity of uniting all forces in the struggle and the great significance of continuing to consolidate and develop the party in the struggle.
    Just as the last congress paved the way for the achievements of the past two years, the 26th Congress will become a new starting point for the Communist Party of Great Britain to achieve new victories in future struggles.

    新的胜利的起点——记英共第二十六次代表大会
    本报记者　潘非　李一川
    历时四天的英共第二十六次代表大会，已于3月30日闭幕。这次大会突出地显示了全党的团结一致，显示了英国工人阶级先锋队对于自己的正义事业的无限信心。英共总书记高兰说：这是英国共产党成立以后开得最好的一次代表大会。
    两年以前，当英共举行第二十五次代表大会的时候，英国资产阶级曾经预言：经历着“危机”的英国共产党，即将“崩溃”和“分裂”，它将退出英国的政治舞台。当时的情况是：英国统治集团利用匈牙利反革命事件，掀起了凶狠恶毒的反共运动，而在英共内部，也确有一小撮修正主义分子在兴风作浪。两年的时间过去了，资产阶级的“预言”没有实现，而且也永远不会实现。英共第二十六次代表大会，把马克思列宁主义的红旗举得更高。现在，资产阶级的宣传机器沉默了。他们承认了自己的失败。
    两年来，英国共产党的队伍在斗争中巩固了，并有了发展。在第二十五次代表大会前后，党员人数曾一度减少。现在，英共党员又增加到二万六千五百余人。在最近的五个月内，英共接收了三千五百名新党员。这反映了广大群众对保守党的不满，对工党的失望，对共产党的拥戴和寄予希望。来自苏格兰的代表告诉记者：在当地的某一矿工区内，去年只有四个党员。在反对关闭矿井时，党领导了这个斗争，党的影响迅速扩大。现在，这个区已发展到二十五名党员。
    两年来，英国共产党在英国政治生活中所起的影响日益增长。在保卫劳动人民的利益和保卫和平的斗争中，共产党提出了最鲜明的纲领，进行了最坚决的斗争。去年英共所组织的反对美国军事基地的大示威，推动了英国的和平运动，产生了巨大的影响。英国共产党领导了反对解雇、要求增加工资、反对增加房租的斗争，成为英国劳动人民切身利益的保卫者。英共的影响可以从这样一个事例中看出，最近英国全国矿工工会改选总书记时，共产党员彭特胜利当选。在英国七十万矿工中，只有两千多名共产党员，而彭特得到了二十多万个矿工的选票。
    第二十六次代表大会的任务，是总结两年来的经验，并根据新的形势部署新的斗争。正如高兰的报告所指出的，获得成功的重要原因之一，是因为党进行了反修正主义的斗争，并和社会民主主义思想划清了界线。
    这次代表大会对经济问题给予了极大的注意。目前的情况是，英国资产阶级正在把危机的负担转嫁到劳动人民身上。代表大会提出了保卫劳动人民利益的行动纲领，要求展开反解雇斗争，争取增加工资和缩短工时；主张把英国的军费减少二分之一，以节省下来的款项改善人民生活。
    代表大会对当前的政治局势作了分析。大会指出，保守党提不出、也不可能提出解决英国问题的纲领，而工党的改良主义政策，随着战后“繁荣”的结束，也已彻底失败。英共政治委员会委员坎贝尔的发言，揭穿了工党右派政策的实质。他说：工党右派认为只要控制几个中央机构，就可以使就业、生产和工资都不断地增加。“遗憾的是，经济萧条损污了这幅图画。……资本家的利润比资本主义历史上任何时期都高。所有这些胡说八道，都是为了削弱工人阶级的斗志。”基于对英国目前情况的分析，代表大会特别强调了在斗争中团结一切力量的必要性，以及在斗争中继续巩固党和发展党的重大意义。
    正如上次代表大会为过去两年来的成就开辟了道路一样，第二十六次代表大会，将成为英共在今后斗争中取得新的胜利的起点。
