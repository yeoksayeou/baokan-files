Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th—People from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a gathering at the Moranbong Theater tonight to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "March 1st" Movement.

    Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myung-hee pointed out in his speech at the meeting that forty years ago, under the influence of the victory of the October Revolution, the people of Korea rose up in unison to hold the "March 1st" movement against Japanese imperialism. This movement, which shook the world, dealt a great blow to the Japanese aggressors.

    Hong Myung-hee said that later the movement was brutally suppressed by the Japanese aggressors. The lesson of this movement shows that it is impossible without a correct working-class party. He said that in the 1930s, the strong Korean communists led by Comrade Kim Il-sung, based on past revolutionary experiences and lessons, organized anti-Japanese guerrillas and carried out armed anti-Japanese struggles, which inspired the Korean people and showed the world that the Korean people were unconquerable.

    When talking about the achievements of socialist construction in Korea since liberation, Hong Myung-hee said that this year the per capita output of many heavy industrial products of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will greatly exceed that of Japan, which once invaded Korea. He pointed out that today the people of South Korea are still living a miserable life under the occupation of the American aggressors, just like they did forty years ago.

    He emphasized that the three thousand miles of Korean territory will never allow foreign aggressors to seize it. The Korean people of today are not the Korean people of forty years ago. The blood of patriotic martyrs is boiling in our hearts. The people of the whole country must mobilize together and fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet, Nam Il, Vice Premier of the Cabinet, Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul and Kim Chang-man, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and others attended today's meeting.

    纪念“三·一”运动四十周年
    平壤各界举行集会
    新华社平壤28日电　平壤市各界今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场举行集会，纪念“三·一”运动四十周年。
    朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹在会上讲话时指出，四十年以前，朝鲜全国人民在十月革命胜利的影响下，一致奋起举行了“三·一”反对日本帝国主义的运动。这一震动了全世界的运动给日本侵略者以很大的打击。
    洪命熹说，后来这个运动被日本侵略者残酷地镇压下去了。这个运动的教训表明，没有一个正确的工人阶级的政党是不行的。他说，到了三十年代，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜坚强的共产主义者，根据过去的革命经验和教训，组织了抗日游击队，进行了反日武装斗争，鼓舞了朝鲜人民，并且向全世界显示了朝鲜人民是不可征服的。
    洪命熹在谈到解放以后朝鲜社会主义建设的成就时说，今年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国许多重工业产品按人口平均计算的产量将大大超过曾经侵略朝鲜的日本。他指出，今天南朝鲜人民仍然像四十年以前一样，在美国侵略者的占领下过着悲惨的日子。
    他强调说，朝鲜的三千里江山决不容许外国侵略者强占，今天的朝鲜人民已经不是四十年以前的朝鲜人民了，爱国先烈的热血在我们的心脏中沸腾，全国人民要一致动员起来，为祖国的和平统一而斗争。参加今天大会的有：朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一，内阁副首相南日，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲和金昌满等。
