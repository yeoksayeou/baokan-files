Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The 1958 conscription and replenishment work has been completely finished. The eligible young people who were approved for military service have arrived successively at the People's Liberation Army's ground, naval and air forces to fulfill the glorious duty of defending the motherland.

The 1958 conscription work was carried out after the realization of communization in the national countryside and the implementation of the system of everyone a soldier. The political quality and physical condition of the new recruits are very good. Most of the new recruits have received preliminary military training in the militia and have mastered certain military techniques and knowledge. In the conscription work, many moving stories emerged in various places of eligible young people actively enlisting, fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, and brothers competing to join the army. Zhu Baolin, a 64-year-old man from the Weiguo People's Commune in Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province, said when sending his son to enlist: "Now that we have communes, life is getting better, and I am sending my son to defend the country and protect our happy life." Yang Yupuo, the father of martyr Yang Lian'di, rushed to the Tianjin No. 3 Chemical Factory after hearing the news of the start of conscription and encouraged his youngest son, Yang Lianjin, who was working in the factory, to sign up for enlistment. He said to his son, "The better our country is built, the more the imperialists will hate us. You must take on your brother's aspirations and defend our national defense well." When the whole family celebrated Yang Lianjin's enlistment, Yang Changlin, the son of martyr Yang Lian'di, said to his uncle, "I will study hard and exercise so that when your term of service is over, I can take over your position as well."

In Fujian Province, which is located on the front line of coastal defense, more than 95% of the eligible young people wrote letters of determination, requesting to enlist in the army. Eighteen eligible young people from Yueyang Village in Yongtai County rushed to the conscription registration station, more than 20 li away, late at night to sign up for enlistment. Yang Jiachun, a young worker from Xiamen City whose father was killed by the Chiang army, said when he signed up for enlistment: "I am determined to take up arms to defend the coast and avenge my father and the compatriots who were killed by the Chiang army."

The new recruits who enlisted in the army were warmly welcomed by the local governments and people and enthusiastically welcomed by the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army when they left their hometowns and arrived at various units of the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Hundreds of thousands of veteran soldiers who have completed their terms of service in the People's Liberation Army's ground and air forces this year have been leaving the army since early March and returning to industrial and agricultural production and construction posts.

These veteran soldiers, who have been cultivated and educated by the Party for three or four years in the revolutionary army and have undergone strict military training, have generally improved their communist ideological awareness and have learned the skills to defend the motherland. Most of them are excellent marksmen, technical experts and five-good soldiers, and many have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Before leaving the army, they all expressed their firm obedience to the allocation of the Party and the state, vowing to always maintain the glorious character of the people's soldiers and continue to serve the people on the industrial and agricultural production front.

Before retiring from the army, these veteran soldiers seized the time to pass on their skills and experience to the new recruits who enlisted this year. Before leaving the team, veteran soldiers of the coastal defense troops on the Fujian front not only ensured that they "stood the last post well and performed the last duty well," but also patiently led the new soldiers to familiarize themselves with the terrain in the警戒 area again and again, and explained in detail the specific methods for dealing with various situations. When the officers and soldiers of the部队 bid farewell to them as they embarked on their construction posts, many people shook hands with their comrades-in-arms tightly and said excitedly: Let us compete with each other in the positions of building and defending the motherland.

    各地适龄青年踊跃应征入伍
    1958年度征兵工作全部结束
    数十万退伍老战士走上生产建设岗位
    新华社26日讯　1958年度征集补充兵员工作已经全部结束。被批准服兵役的适龄青年已先后到达中国人民解放军陆、海、空军部队，履行保卫祖国的光荣义务。
    1958年度征兵工作是在全国农村实现公社化和实行全民皆兵制度以后进行的。应征入伍的新兵的政治质量、体质条件都很好。大多数新兵都在民兵队伍里受过初步的军事训练，掌握了一定的军事技术和军事知识。在征兵工作中，各地都涌现出许多适龄青年踊跃应征，父送子、妻送夫、兄弟争相入伍的动人事例。江苏省大丰县卫国人民公社六十四岁的老人朱保林在送儿子应征服兵役时说：“现在公社化了，日子过得更好了，我送儿子去保卫国家，保卫幸福生活。”杨连弟烈士的父亲杨玉璞听到开始征兵的消息后，赶到天津第三化工厂，鼓励在厂里做工的小儿子杨连金报名应征，他对儿子说：“咱们的国家建设得越好，帝国主义就越恨咱们，你要担起你哥哥的志愿，好好保卫咱们的国防。”在全家欢送杨连金入伍的时候，杨连弟烈士的儿子杨长林对叔叔说：“我一定好好读书，锻炼身体，等你服役期满了，我也去接替你的岗位。”
    位于海防前线的福建省，95％以上的适龄青年都写了决心书，要求应征服兵役。永泰县岳阳村十八名适龄青年深夜赶到二十多里外的征兵登记站报名应征。被蒋军打死了父亲的厦门市青年工人杨家春在报名应征时说：“我决心拿起武器保卫海防，给我父亲和被蒋军杀害的同胞报仇。”
    应征入伍的新兵在离开家乡和到达人民解放军各部队时，受到当地政府与人民群众的热烈欢送和部队官兵热情的欢迎。
    新华社26日讯　今年已在中国人民解放军陆、空军部队服役期满的数十万老战士，从3月上旬起，陆续离开部队，回到工农业生产建设岗位上。
    今年退伍的老战士，在革命部队里经过党的三、四年的培养教育和严格的军事训练，普遍地提高了共产主义思想觉悟，学会了保卫祖国的本领，其中多数人都是优等射手、技术能手和五好战士，很多人参加了共产党和共青团。在离开部队之前，他们都表示坚决服从党和国家的分配，永远保持人民战士的光荣本色，在工农业生产战线上继续为人民服务。
    这些老战士在退伍以前，都抓紧时间，把自己的技术和经验传授给今年入伍的新战士。福建前线海防部队退伍的老战士在离队前，不但保证“站好最后一班岗、值好最后一次勤”，还耐心地一次又一次地带领新战士熟悉了警戒区域内的地形，详细交代了应付各种情况的具体办法。当部队官兵依依不舍地欢送他们走上建设岗位时，很多人都紧握着战友们的双手，激动地说：让我们在建设祖国、保卫祖国的岗位上互相竞赛吧。
