(This was) sent from Xining by our newspaper. The Hongqi People's Commune in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, established a family visit system during the rectification of the commune, further strengthening its ties with the masses.

During the rectification, commune cadres organized thirteen visiting groups to visit households one by one. During the visits, commune members raised many questions related to production and life. For example, some commune members pointed out that they lacked experience in arranging labor last year, and sometimes it was not entirely appropriate, so this year they need to adjust it properly to make better use of labor. Some commune members pointed out that after the increase in grain and fruit production last year, they did not pay enough attention to conservation, and arrangements should be made earlier this year.

From the beginning of the visits to the previous stage, commune members of this commune had already put forward 591 opinions on production management, 544 on living welfare, and 310 on the work style of cadres. Those opinions that could be resolved immediately were resolved, and those that could not be resolved immediately were also explained. Through family visits, many commune members said, "This rectification truly solves problems!" Now, the cadres and commune members have even greater enthusiasm and are trying every means to complete this year's agricultural production increase work.

    乐都红旗公社关心群众生产生活
    社干部经常访问社员家庭
    本报西宁电　青海省乐都县红旗人民公社在整社过程中建立了一项家庭访问制度，进一步密切了和群众的联系。
    整社中社干部曾组织了十三个访问小组逐门逐户进行访问。访问中，社员提出许多有关生产和生活等问题，比如，有的社员提出去年在劳动力安排上因为没有经验，有的时候不够完全恰当，今年需要好好调整，使劳动力运用得更恰当，有的社员提出去年粮食、水果增产后，没有很好的注意节约，今年要早作安排。
    从开始访问到前一阶段，这个公社的社员已经提出有关生产管理的意见五百九十一条，有关生活福利的五百四十四条，有关干部作风的三百一十条。这些意见能立即解决的就解决，不能立即解决的也做了交代。通过家庭访问，许多社员说：“这次整社真正解决问题！”现在，干部和社员的干劲更大，都在想尽办法努力完成今年的农业增产工作。
