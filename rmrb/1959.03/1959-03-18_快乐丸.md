    "Happy Pills"
    Poem by Tian Ma, Painting by Jiang Yousheng
    Lord Lao's elixir,
    Guanyin's sweet dew,
    Myths have a thousand magical cures,
    But none compare to America's pills and powders.
    The names of these drugs are quite novel,
    Called "Stimulant Pills" and "Happy Pills,"
    Newspaper ads sing their praises to the heavens,
    Claiming they miraculously cure all sorts of incurable diseases:
    The oppressed take them to lessen their worries,
    The unemployed take them to feel better,
    They can both relieve sorrow and dispel melancholy,
    Truly miraculous and profound!
    The unemployed lead miserable lives,
    America has a particularly large number of worry-stricken patients,
    Everyone rushes to buy the drugs,
    The profits swell the capitalists' moneybags.
    The deceptive tricks become increasingly new,
    The capitalists' hearts become increasingly ruthless.
    Taking pills to relieve sorrow only deepens the sorrow,
    The people's suffering becomes even heavier and deeper!

### “快乐丸”

    “快乐丸”
    天马诗　江有生画
    李老君的仙丹，
    观世音的甘泉，
    神话里灵丹妙药千百件，
    比不上美国的膏丹丸散。
    这药名儿却也新鲜，
    叫什么“兴奋片”、“快乐丸”，
    报纸广告吹得天花乱坠，
    说是医诸般绝症怪灵验：
    被压迫的人吃了少烦恼，
    失业的人吃了心情好，
    既能解忧又会消愁，
    神通广大真奥妙！
    失业的人失意的生活，
    美国的忧愁病者特别多，
    大家争着把药买，
    利润把资本家的钱袋胀破。
    骗人的把戏越变越新，
    资本家的心肠越来越狠。
    吃药消愁愁更愁，
    人民的苦难更重更深！
