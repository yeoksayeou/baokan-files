Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The people from all walks of life in Wuhan, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenyang, Harbin, Taiyuan, Changchun, Fuzhou, Lanzhou and other cities have held seminars, resolutely supporting the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the rebellion, and angrily denouncing the treasonous crimes of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet.
    At the symposium held by the sailors in Wuhan, Lin Youqing, the mate of the "Wu Jian No. 2" ship, said: "The people of the whole country are working hard to build the motherland, but the rebels in Tibet are undermining the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities, which is really infuriating." Teachers and students from the Central Institute for Nationalities' South-Central Branch, Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping, and Hubei University also held seminars and wrote big-character posters to denounce the heinous crimes of the Tibetan reactionary clique. Tan Du, a Zhuang teacher from the Ethnic Institute branch, said: "The rapid suppression of the Lhasa rebellion by the People's Liberation Army shows that the rebels' conspiracy to split the motherland has gone bankrupt, which is a great victory for the Party's policy on nationalities." On the 29th, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference invited the heads of democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, ethnic minorities, religious groups, returned overseas Chinese, and non-party figures in the Wuhan area to hold a symposium. Tang Zhe, chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and Chen Jianxun, vice chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church, said in their speeches that the People's Liberation Army put down the Lhasa rebellion in just two or three days, which shows that the imperialists and traitors have completely miscalculated the situation in Tibet and that the broad masses of the Tibetan people do not support them.
    Tibetan teachers and students teaching and studying in Shaanxi Province held a forum on the 29th. Tibetan teacher Phuntsok Tsering said: "The rebels betrayed the motherland and the vast Tibetan people, and vainly attempted to let the Tibetan people be enslaved by them for generations to come. We will never agree to this." Tibetan girl Laji, who came from the Garri pastoral area of Tibet to study in the interior, said: "The Tibetan people sincerely love the Communist Party. The reactionaries say that the Communist Party is not good, which is completely turning black and white upside down." Bai Zhen's husband, Jin Jiu (Tibetan), a Tibetan student, is an active officer in the People's Liberation Army and is currently quelling the rebellion in Tibet. In addition to expressing her determination at the meeting, she also wrote a letter to her husband, instructing him to fulfill the sacred duties of the People's Liberation Army and resolutely quell the rebellion together with the Tibetan people. Many workers, students and heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Xi'an also expressed their firm support for the measures taken by the State Council to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities.
    The people of Guangzhou were extremely indignant at the rebellion created by the Tibetan reactionary forces in collusion with imperialism, and expressed their respect to the PLA troops stationed in Tibet for their swift crushing of the rebellion. Song Junzhuo, a worker in the engine repair workshop of the Guangzhou Shipyard, said that the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet colluded with imperialism to launch a rebellion, which was a criminal act of betraying the motherland and violating the will of the Tibetan people. In order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities, it was perfectly correct and wise for the State Council to order the suppression of the rebellion in a timely manner. Li Shanggong, a Zhuang worker and advanced producer from the Guangzhou No. 1 Heavy Machinery Plant, said: "The Zhuang people, who have made great progress in all aspects under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao since liberation, will never tolerate the criminal acts of the Tibetan reactionary forces in undermining national unity and betraying the motherland."
    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Guangzhou Municipal Committee also held a symposium to denounce the Tibetan traitorous group. Zhang Boquan, vice chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, said at the meeting: "The Tibetan traitorous group colluded with imperialism to carry out a rebellion, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of all nationalities in the country."
    Wu Juetian, chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Zhi Gong Party, said: "The rapid suppression of this rebellion shows that the Tibetan monks, secular people, and patriotic upper and middle strata are completely on the side of safeguarding the unity of the motherland and safeguarding national unity. In addition to expressing our warm support for the order of the State Council, we must also be vigilant and crush any sabotage conspiracy of imperialism." Yi Meihou, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: "The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and suppress the Tibetan bandits is completely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. The returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province fully support the measures taken by the State Council to quell the rebellion."
    Many factories, institutions and schools in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City held seminars and wrote letters to the Sichuan Daily and Chengdu Daily to angrily denounce the towering crimes of the Tibetan traitors. At a symposium held by the workers of the Red Flag Iron Factory in Chengdu, Long Qinghe, an advanced producer in Sichuan Province, said: "We the working class resolutely support the order of the State Council. Only by thoroughly eradicating the rebels can we consolidate the unity of the motherland and enable the Tibetan people to be reborn." Guo Ji Muge (Yi nationality), vice chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Political Consultative Conference and deputy governor of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, and Wang Haimin (Yi nationality), deputy governor of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, also made speeches saying: "The broad masses of working people and the majority of the upper strata in the Tibetan region are patriotic and resolutely support the Communist Party's policy on nationalities, safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities. The upper-class reactionary group instigated a rebellion, which goes against the wishes and vital interests of the majority of the Tibetan people and only benefits imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Therefore, they will inevitably be abandoned by the broad masses of the Tibetan people and come to a complete failure."
    The people of Chongqing enthusiastically supported the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the rebellion, and unanimously believed that due to the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion, a new page is unfolding in the history of Tibet.
    At a forum held by people from the Islamic community in Chongqing, Ding Qishan, the head of the Islamic church, said that the Kalon and the upper-class reactionary group of the Tibetan local government colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, openly gathered bandits for armed rebellion, harmed the people, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and tore up the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Such crimes of betraying the motherland and undermining unification are intolerable to the law of the country. The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion and the decision that the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region should exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government are very correct. These measures will play a huge role in safeguarding the unity of the motherland, stabilizing the social order in Tibet, promoting the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.
    The working class of Shenyang, who are striving to achieve greater leaps in production this year, unanimously support the measures taken by the State Council against the Tibetan rebellion. Wang Fengen, an engineer at the Shenyang Transformer Factory and a municipal model worker, said: "The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government is in line with the interests of the Tibetan people." Yang Weigang, a milling worker at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, said: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group openly tore up the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and betrayed the motherland, which is intolerable to the law of the country. Those traitors who are determined to be enemies of the people must be severely punished." Teachers and students from Liaoning University, Shenyang Medical College, Shenyang No. 5 Middle School and other schools unanimously believed in the discussion that with the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, the consolidation of the unity of the motherland and the promotion of the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people have been further promoted. The heads of the Liaoning Province and Shenyang City organizations of various democratic parties all expressed their firm support for the order of the State Council. Chen Guangzhou, chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group violated the interests of the Tibetan people and betrayed the motherland, which is intolerable."
    The people of Harbin also unanimously condemned the crimes of the Tibetan traitorous group. Su Guangming, a famous model worker, said: "We resolutely support the order of the State Council, quickly and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion, and safeguard the unity of the motherland and the unity of the people of all nationalities." Jingguan, a standing director of the Buddhist Association of China, said that the rebellion activities of the Tibetan traitors were truly heinous and intolerable to the law of the country. We resolutely support all the measures taken by the central government for this rebellion incident in Tibet. The heads of local organizations of various democratic parties and the broad masses of intellectuals in Harbin also held seminars to support the resolute measures taken by the State Council to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities.
    The heads of democratic parties and people's organizations in Shanxi Province have issued statements. Li Guanyang, deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The upper-class reactionary group in Tibet represents the interests of the most reactionary large serf owners. Their treasonous acts are not only intolerable to the law of the country, but also violate the will and wishes of the Tibetan people. The conspiracy of the reactionary group cannot succeed, and their rebellion is only self-destructive." Dao Tieshan, a member of the China Islamic Association and director of the Taiyuan Mosque, said that since liberation, the central government has given meticulous care to the Tibetan people, and the economic and cultural undertakings in Tibet are constantly developing, but the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet is not willing to let the Tibetan people live a good life. They will inevitably run into a brick wall in front of the people of the motherland.
    The people of Changchun held seminars one after another, angrily condemning the treasonous crimes of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet. After seeing the news that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group launched an armed rebellion, all the staff and workers of the First Automotive Manufacturing Plant were indignant. All the staff and workers of the plant unanimously supported the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the rebellion. More than 6,000 students from Jilin Normal University held a general seminar, and the students in Class 4, Grade 1 of the Chinese Department also wrote a letter to the PLA troops stationed in Tibet, congratulating them on their victory in quelling the Lhasa rebellion. Religious figures and democratic parties in Changchun also held symposiums, expressing their firm support for the State Council's order. They unanimously believed that a new page is unfolding in the history of Tibet.
    The people of Fuzhou held rallies one after another. Qin Dajin, a well-known model worker from the Cold Work Boiler Factory, said: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group colluded with imperialism, betrayed the country and harmed the people, and undermined unification. We must resolutely suppress them." He said: "After liberation, the people of all nationalities in the motherland have formed a close-knit family. A small group of reactionaries in Tibet launched a rebellion, but they are only digging their own graves." Chen Kunzong, the leader of the Duyu Garden Production Team of Chengmen Commune in the suburbs, said: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group regard the central government's attitude of benevolence and righteousness towards them as weak and deceitful. Only by thoroughly quelling the rebellion and building a democratic and socialist new Tibet can we protect the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet and safeguard national unity and national solidarity." The democratic parties, returned overseas Chinese, religious figures, ethnic minorities, and the broad masses of residents and women here have also expressed their firm support for the order of the State Council and angrily denounced the crimes of the Tibetan traitorous group.
    At the Northwest Institute for Nationalities in Lanzhou, nearly a thousand Tibetan teachers and students condemned the crimes of the Tibetan rebels. Filled with righteous indignation, they scrambled to speak at the symposium and wrote big-character posters on the spot, expressing their firm support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. Li Zonghua, deputy director of the Chinese Department, and Hou Shengzhen, head of the Tibetan Language Teaching and Research Group, and other Tibetan teachers said that the Tibetan rebellion can only show that the Tibetan traitorous group has taken off its hypocritical mask, which can only prompt our Tibetan people to recognize their reactionary essence and evil conspiracy faster, and promote their early demise. All the students of Tibetan Class 7 and Tibetan Class 10 in the Chinese Department resolutely stated that the unity of the motherland cannot be divided, the solidarity of all nationalities cannot be undermined, the Tibetan working people must be completely liberated, and the rebellion must be completely suppressed.

    各地人民怒指西藏叛匪
    新华社30日讯　武汉、西安、广州、成都、重庆、沈阳、哈尔滨、太原、长春、福州、兰州等城市的各界人民，纷纷举行座谈会，坚决拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令，愤怒地声讨西藏上层反动集团的叛国罪行。
    在武汉市海员们举行的座谈会上，武建二号轮大副林幼清说：全国人民正在努力建设祖国，而西藏的叛乱分子却在那里破坏祖国的统一和民族团结，实在令人愤怒。中央民族学院中南分院、武汉测绘学院、湖北大学等校师生也纷纷座谈和写大字报，声讨西藏反动集团的滔天罪行。民族学院分院的僮族教师谭度说：拉萨叛乱被人民解放军迅速平定，说明叛乱分子分裂祖国的阴谋已经破产，这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。政协武汉市委员会29日邀请武汉地区各民主党派组织、工商界、少数民族、宗教团体、归国华侨的负责人和无党派人士举行了座谈。民盟湖北省委员会主任委员唐哲和基督教三自爱国运动会副主席陈建勋在发言中说，人民解放军在短短两三天内就平定了拉萨的叛乱，这说明帝国主义和叛国分子对西藏的形势完全估计错了，广大西藏人民是不支持他们的。
    在陕西省教书和学习的藏族师生在29日举行座谈会。藏族教员平措次仁说：叛乱分子背叛祖国，背叛广大藏族人民，妄想让藏族人民世世代代永远受他们的宰割，这我们决不答应。从西藏嘉黎牧区到内地来学习的藏族姑娘拉基说：西藏人民都衷心爱戴共产党。反动分子说共产党不好，这完全是颠倒黑白。藏族学生拜珍的丈夫金纠（藏族）是人民解放军的现役军官，目前正在西藏平息叛乱。她除了在会上发言表示自己的决心外，还写信给丈夫，嘱咐他履行解放军的神圣职责，和西藏人民一道坚决平息叛乱。西安市许多职工、学生及各民主党派地方组织负责人也纷纷表示坚决拥护国务院为维护祖国统一和民族团结所采取的措施。
    广州市各界人民对西藏反动势力勾结帝国主义制造叛乱事件极为愤慨，对解放军驻藏部队迅速粉碎叛乱表示敬意。广州造船厂轮机修配车间职工宋均卓说，西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义发动叛乱，是背叛祖国、也是违反西藏人民意志的罪恶行为。国务院为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，及时命令平息叛乱，是十分正确和英明的。广州第一重型机器厂僮族工人、先进生产者黎尚功说：解放后在共产党和毛主席领导下各方面都取得巨大进步的僮族人民，决不能容忍西藏反动势力破坏国家统一、破坏民族团结和背叛祖国的罪恶行为。
    中国人民政治协商会议广东省委员会和广州市委员会也举行了座谈会，声讨西藏叛国集团，省政协副主席张?村在会上说：西藏叛国集团勾结帝国主义进行叛乱，是全国各族人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    致公党广州市委员会主任委员伍觉天说：这次叛乱的迅速平定，说明西藏僧俗人民群众和爱国的中上层人士是完全站在维护祖国统一、维护民族团结的立场上的。我们除了表示热烈拥护国务院的命令之外，还必须提高警惕，粉碎帝国主义的任何破坏阴谋。”广东省归国华侨联合会主席蚁美厚说：国务院命令解散西藏地方政府，讨伐西藏叛匪，是完全符合西藏人民和全国人民的利益。广东省的归国华侨和华侨眷属完全拥护国务院为平定叛乱而采取的措施。
    四川省和成都市许多工厂、机关、学校纷纷举行座谈并写信给“四川日报”和“成都日报”，愤怒声讨西藏叛国分子的滔天罪行。成都市红旗铁工厂职工举行的座谈会上，四川省先进生产者龙清和说：我们工人阶级坚决拥护国务院的命令，只有彻底肃清叛乱分子，才能巩固祖国的统一和使西藏人民获得新生。四川省政协副主席、凉山彝族自治州副州长果基木古（彝族）、凉山彝族自治州副州长王海民（彝族）也发表谈话说：西藏地区广大劳动人民和多数上层人士是爱国的，是坚决拥护共产党的民族政策、维护祖国统一和各民族团结的。上层反动集团策动叛乱，违背了西藏大多数人民的愿望和切身利益，只对帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石集团有利，因此，他们必然会遭到广大西藏人民的唾弃而归于彻底失败。
    重庆市各界人民热烈拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛匪的命令，并一致认为由于西藏反动势力的叛乱和叛乱的失败，西藏的历史正在展开新的一页。
    在重庆伊斯兰教界人士举行的座谈会上，伊斯兰教教长丁岐山说，西藏地方政府噶伦和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和国外反动分子，公然纠集叛匪进行武装叛乱，残害人民，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁关于和平解放西藏的十七条协议，这种背叛祖国、破坏统一的罪行，实为国法所不容。国务院下令解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府，决定由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权，这是非常正确的。这些措施对维护祖国统一，安定西藏社会秩序，促进西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生，都将起巨大的作用。
    正在力争实现今年生产更大跃进的沈阳市工人阶级，一致拥护国务院对西藏叛乱采取的措施。沈阳市变压器厂工程师、市劳动模范王凤恩说：国务院命令解散西藏地方政府，这是符合西藏人民的利益的。沈阳矿山机器厂铣工杨维纲说：西藏地方政府和上层反动集团公然撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，背叛祖国，实为国法所不容，对那些坚决与人民为敌的叛国分子必须严加惩办。辽宁大学、沈阳医学院、沈阳市第五中学等校师生在座谈时一致认为，随着西藏叛乱被迅速平息，更加促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。各民主党派辽宁省和沈阳市组织的负责人都表示坚决拥护国务院的命令。中国民主同盟辽宁省委员会主任委员陈光舟说：西藏地方政府和上层反动集团违背西藏人民的利益，背叛祖国，是可忍孰不可忍。
    哈尔滨市各界人民也一致声讨西藏叛国集团的罪行。著名劳动模范苏广铭说：我们坚决拥护国务院的命令，迅速彻底平息西藏叛乱，维护祖国的统一和各民族人民的团结。中国佛教协会常务理事静观法师说，西藏叛国分子的叛乱活动真是罪大恶极，为国法所不容。我们坚决拥护中央对西藏这次叛乱事件所采取的一切措施。哈尔滨市各民主党派地方组织负责人和广大知识分子也纷纷座谈，拥护国务院为维护祖国统一和民族团结所采取的坚决措施。
    山西省各民主党派、各人民团体负责人纷纷发表谈话。中国国民党革命委员会山西省委员会副主任委员李冠洋说：西藏上层反动集团是代表最反动的大农奴主的利益的，他们的叛国行为不仅国法所不容，也违反西藏人民的意志和愿望。反动集团的阴谋是不能得逞的，他们的叛乱只是自取灭亡。中国伊斯兰教协会委员、太原市清真寺理事长岛铁山说，解放以来，中央对西藏人民的关怀无微不至，西藏的经济和文化事业正在不断发展，但是西藏的上层反动集团却不甘心西藏人民过好生活。他们在祖国人民面前，必然会碰得头破血流。
    长春市各界人民纷纷举行座谈，愤怒谴责西藏上层反动集团的叛国罪行。第一汽车制造厂全体职工看到西藏地方政府及上层反动集团发动武装叛乱的消息后，群情激愤，全厂职工一致拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令。吉林师范大学六千多名学生普遍举行了座谈，中文系一年级四班的学生还写信给解放军驻西藏部队，祝贺他们平定拉萨叛乱的胜利。长春市宗教界人士和民主党派人士都纷纷举行座谈会，表示坚决拥护国务院的命令，他们一致认为：西藏的历史正在展开新的一页。
