In a noble person, we often see how high a person's communist selflessness can be developed. The great Xiang Xiuli has become a brilliant example for everyone to learn from.

Look! For the sake of the factory, all the workers, and the lives and property of nearby residents, she is fighting desperately against the raging fire.

Listen! That person whose whole body is engulfed in flames is shouting loudly to his companions who are urging her to leave the fire: "Don't worry about me, quickly find someone to put out the fire!"

The person who fainted and was being carried away opened her eyes; we hear her struggling to say: "Don't worry about me, quickly save the metallic sodium."

The person who had been in a coma for four days woke up; listen to the first thing she said: "Did the metallic sodium explode? Did the factory suffer any losses?"

She smiled! She completely forgot the pain of burns all over her body, because she heard the answer: "The metallic sodium did not explode! The factory did not suffer any losses!"

She is again concerned about inquiring: Was Luo Xiuming injured? How badly? She is asking someone to send my regards to Luo Xiuming, and be sure not to tell her that my injuries are very serious, so as not to make her sad.

What is she discussing with the doctors again? She is unwilling to use so many precious medicines, she wants to save as much as possible for the country: Let me drink some wine, drinking some wine can also relieve the pain.

What is she discussing with the nurses again? She is unwilling for others to give her blood transfusions: Will blood transfusions affect their health? Will this affect their work?

Who is that visiting her? Ah, her husband. Listen to what she is instructing him: Don't worry about me, don't think about me when you work, if you're inattentive, there will be accidents while driving.

Who is that visiting her again? Ah, her mother. Why is she hiding her left hand, only showing her right hand? She is afraid that her left hand is too seriously injured and will increase the elderly person's concern. She stretched out her right hand and said with a smile: "Mom, look, I'm almost better, you don't have to worry about me."

Why does she always ask for the radio to be turned on? To cover up her weak moans, so as not to increase the inner pain of those around her.

Why does she want the doctors and nurses to dance in front of her bed? In order to allow those guarding her bedside to happily celebrate the New Year's Eve, in order to slightly alleviate the unease in her heart caused by the fact that they cannot have a holiday because of her.

What was she most concerned about before she passed away? How that young member of the Youth League doctor can join the Party as soon as possible.

What were her parting words to her husband? "If anything happens, consult the Party more, listening to the Party is never wrong." Comrade Xiang Xiuli used all her strength to say her last words.

This is the words and actions of a great person in more than thirty days. She used these glorious words and deeds to construct a golden and splendid spiritual world for us. In this world, the "self" as an individual has completely melted into the collective.

The great selfless person Xiang Xiuli, with the great spirit of "one for all," has set up a golden image of a communist in front of us. She condensed her life principles into such a crystal-like formula: to contribute everything to the Party, to the great collective, and to all mankind at all times. The poet Guo Moruo praised her, saying: "Comrade Xiang Xiuli, your whole body has turned into light." The selfless person is to transform the new "self" into light, like the sun, forever shining on the world, so that one's own light can serve mankind.

Xiang Xiuli makes us realize that communists are always completely aware of their existence and the obligations they owe to the collective and to mankind, and can always, completely naturally, and meticulously fulfill these obligations. This will inevitably be expressed as selfless actions in all the minutiae of life.

From the beginning of establishing a clear collectivist consciousness—raising the banner of the new self in thought—to the purely natural action, there is a refining process, and people also abandon impurities and become a "true communist," rising to a new realm of human morality. Countless heroic revolutionary martyrs are like this, all living old communist fighters are like this, and good children of the working class like the young Xiang Xiuli are also like this.

Individualists demand that their own self be expanded to the point where it cannot be added to, and that all others be squeezed to the point where they cannot be accommodated. They want to turn others into the fertilizer for their own growth; while communists, however, carry forward the spirit of collectivism to the point of permeating the entire universe, embracing all others into their own arms, while melting their own "self" into the blood of all people, forming a whole that is connected by flesh and blood. The "self" of the selfless person is only a cell on the collective body, a drop of blood in the blood vessel, contributing everything for the growth and health of the whole.

    伟大的忘我者
    庄农
    在一个崇高的人底身上，我们常常看到：人的共产主义的忘我精神，能够发扬到怎样的高度。伟大的向秀丽，已经因此成了人人竞相学习的光辉榜样。
    你看啊！为了工厂、全体工人、附近居民的生命财产，她正在同熊熊烈火作拼死的恶斗。
    你听啊！混身已燃起了火团的那个人，正在对劝她退出火场的同伴大声地喊：“不要管我，快去找人来救火！”
    那个昏倒后被抱起来的人睁开眼了；我们听她在挣扎着说什么：“不要管我，快去抢救金属钠。”
    那个昏迷了四天的人醒过来了；你听她说出了第一句话：“金属钠有没有爆炸？工厂有没有受到损失？”
    她笑了！她完全忘记了周身烧伤的痛楚，因为她听到了回答：“金属钠没有爆炸！工厂没有受到损失！”
    她又在关心地探问什么：罗秀明受伤了吗？伤得怎样？她在托人：去代我问候罗秀明吧，千万不要告诉她我伤得很重，使她难过。
    她又同医生们谈论什么？她不愿用那么多的贵重药品，她要为国家尽量节省：让我喝点酒吧，喝点酒也可以止疼。
    她又同护理人员谈论什么？她不愿意别人来给她输血：输血会不会影响他们的健康？这会不会影响他们的工作？
    那是谁来探望她了？啊，她的丈夫。你听她在嘱咐他什么：你别为我耽心，工作时别想念我，思想开小差，开车就要出事故。
    那又是谁来探望她了？啊，她的妈妈。她为什么把左手藏起来，只把右手给她看。她怕左手伤太重增加老年人的耽心。她伸着右手笑着说：“妈，你看，我都快好了，你老人家不用为我操心。”
    她为什么老是要求开响收音机？为了掩盖住她微弱的呻吟，以免增加她周围人的内心痛苦。
    她为什么要医生和护士在她的病床前跳舞？为了使守护在她床前的人能够欢度新年之夜，以稍稍减轻一些因了她，他们不能度假这件事在她内心引起的不安。
    她在临逝以前，所最关心的是什么？是那个青年团员的医生怎样能快些入党。
    她同丈夫诀别的话是什么？“有事多请示党，听党的话，是没有错的。”向秀丽同志用全身所有的力气，说出了最后的话。
    这是一个伟大的人在三十多天内的言行，她用这些光辉的言语和事迹，为我们构筑了一个金光灿烂的精神世界，在这个世界里，作为个人的那个“我”已经完全溶化于集体之中。
    伟大的忘我者向秀丽，用“我为人人”的伟大精神，在我们的面前，树立了一个金光灿灿的共产主义者的形象。她把自己的生活原则，凝聚成这样一个晶体般的公式：要时时刻刻地向党，向伟大的集体，向全人类贡献着自己的一切。诗人郭沫若赞扬说：“向秀丽同志，你全身都化成了光”。忘我者正是要把新的“我”化成光，像太阳一样，永远照耀人间。使自己的光，为人类服务。
    向秀丽使我们认识到，共产主义者时时刻刻完完全全明白自己的存在，对集体，对人类所负的义务，而又能时时刻刻，完全自然的，一丝不苟的去实现这种义务，这样就必然在一切生活的细微末节中都表现为忘我的行动。
    从开始树立明朗的集体主义意识——在思想里插起新我的大旗，到纯乎自然的行动之间有着一个冶炼的过程，人也由此摒弃了杂质，而成为一个“真正的共产主义者”，升入人类道德的新的境界。无数可歌可泣的革命先烈们是这样，一切健在的老的共产主义战士们是这样，年轻如向秀丽这样的工人阶级的好儿女们也是这样。
    个人主义者，要求把一己之我，扩张到无可复加的地步，把一切别人，都排挤到无可容身的地步，要把别人变为自己借以生长的肥料；而共产主义者，却把集体主义精神发扬到弥漫于整个宇宙，把所有别人都揽入自己的怀抱，同时使自己这个“我”溶化到一切人的血液中去，同他们结成血肉相连的整体。忘我者的“我”，只是集体肌体上的一个细胞，血管里的一滴血，为了整体的生长和健在，而供献出自己的一切。
