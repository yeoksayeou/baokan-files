The Ordinary Yet Great Question

“Why do corn leaves always grow to both sides, and not in all directions?” This is an ordinary yet great question, just like “Why does an apple fall to the ground?” Few people who have planted or seen corn have researched this question; perhaps some people have a fleeting thought in their minds, but pass it by without seeking a thorough understanding. To seize a question, to think deeply, and to find a reason no matter what – this is a very precious spirit that needs to be greatly promoted.
To ask questions, to think about reasons, and to discover the laws of objective things developing, is an arduous mental labor, which, in addition to correct thinking methods, also requires abundant political enthusiasm. What force makes Comrade Zhang Mingde interested in the growth of corn leaves? It is his determination to serve the masses in the mountainous areas.

    平凡而伟大的问题
      “玉米叶子为什么老是向两边生长，而不是向四面八方生长呢？”这是一个和“苹果为什么落地”一样平凡而伟大的问题。种过和见到过玉米的人，很少有人研究这个问题；也许有人在脑子里一闪，却不求甚解地过去了。抓住问题，深思熟虑，非找出一个道理不可——这是一种非常珍贵的精神，需要大加提倡。
    提问题，想道理，发现客观事物发生发展的规律，这是一个艰苦的思想劳动，除了有正确的思想方法外，还需要充沛的政治热情。什么力量使张明德同志对玉米叶子生长情况感到兴趣呢？那就是他为山区群众服务的决心。
