Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 16th: At the afternoon session of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on the 16th, the General Secretary of the Syrian Communist Party, Bagdash, spoke about the situation in the Middle East in his congratulatory address. He said: The Arab national liberation movement has achieved great victories in recent years, thanks to the unity of all patriotic forces in Arab countries, the solidarity of the Arab people, and finally, the enthusiastic support of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.

Bagdash said that the most recent victory of the Arab people was the great Iraqi revolution, which destroyed an important stronghold of imperialism in the Near East, undermined the foundations of the Baghdad Pact, and caused a great reaction in Arab countries.

Bagdash pointed out that the Arab national liberation movement is currently at an extremely difficult period. The unity of Arab countries is in serious crisis due to the tense relations between the UAR and the Republic of Iraq. In addition, the political and economic situation in Syria is constantly deteriorating, and imperialism is attempting to undermine the friendly relations between the Arabs and the Soviet Union.

He said, it must be pointed out that the responsibility for this tension lies entirely with certain groups within the UAR.

Bagdash further said that at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Comrade Khrushchev—a loyal friend of the Arab people—warned the Arab people to be vigilant because the imperialists had not abandoned their plans to rule and enslave Arab countries. However, some Arab politicians did not fully understand Khrushchev's friendly advice, which gave Washington convenience. Therefore, U.S. imperialism finally changed its policy towards the UAR.

This situation explains the roots of the anti-Iraq movement and the opposition to the patriotic and progressive forces of Syria and Egypt. This movement has developed to the point of organizing imperialist and reactionary military rebellions against the Republic of Iraq. The Iraqi people and their army crushed this rebellion. Currently, all progressive forces in the world stand on the side of the democratic and patriotic people of the Arab countries.

He said: The leadership of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has turned into a gang of adventurers, spies, and murderers. It has lost all contact with the masses of the people and draws its political and ideological inspiration from the policies of the Yugoslav revisionists—these traitors. The activities of these Yugoslav revisionists—traitors—in Arab countries are particularly destructive and beneficial to U.S. imperialism.

Bagdash said that the Syrian Communist Party has gone underground for the fourth time in its history. But our party has not been separated from the people. He concluded by saying that we can assure you that no force can take away from us the banner of Marxism-Leninism in Syria, because our people have confirmed from their own experience that this is the banner of true patriotism, true socialism, and is bound to win.

### 叙利亚共产党总书记巴格达什指出  阿联伊拉克之间的紧张关系完全应由阿联某些集团负责  南修正主义者在阿拉伯国家的活动有利美帝国主义

    叙利亚共产党总书记巴格达什指出
    阿联伊拉克之间的紧张关系完全应由阿联某些集团负责
    南修正主义者在阿拉伯国家的活动有利美帝国主义
    据新华社华沙16日电在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会上16日下午会议上，叙利亚共产党总书记巴格达什在致祝词时谈到了中近东情况。他说：阿拉伯的民族解放运动在最近几年中取得很大的胜利，这是由于阿拉伯国家全体爱国力量的团结，由于阿拉伯人民的团结一致，最后是由于苏联和整个社会主义阵营的热情支持。
    巴格达什说，阿拉伯人民的最近一次胜利是伟大的伊拉克革命胜利，这次革命破坏了帝国主义在近东的重要的堡垒，破坏了巴格达条约的基础，在阿拉伯国家中引起了很大的反应。
    巴格达什指出目前阿拉伯的民族解放运动处在极困难的时期。阿拉伯国家的团结由于阿联和伊拉克共和国之间的紧张关系而处在严重的危机中，此外，叙利亚的政治和经济情况不断恶化，帝国主义企图破坏阿拉伯和苏联的友好关系。
    他说，必须指出，造成这种紧张局势的责任完全应由阿联某些集团负责。
    巴格达什又说，在苏共第二十一次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫同志——阿拉伯人民的忠实朋友——曾经警告阿拉伯人民要提防着，因为帝国主义者并未放弃自己统治和奴役阿拉伯国家的计划。然而，某些阿拉伯的政治家并没有完全了解赫鲁晓夫的友好的劝告，这就给予了华盛顿方便，因此，美帝国主义最后改变了自己对阿联的政策。
    这种形势说明了反伊拉克运动的根源和反对叙、埃爱国和进步力量的根源。这一运动发展到组织了反伊拉克共和国的具有帝国主义和反动性质的军事暴乱。伊拉克人民和他们的军队粉碎了这一暴乱。目前世界上一切的进步力量是站在阿拉伯国家的民主和爱国人士一边的。
    他说：阿拉伯复兴社会党的领导已经变为冒险分子、间谍和杀人犯匪帮，它已经丧失了与人民群众的一切联系，它从南斯拉夫修正主义者——这些叛徒们的政策中取得政治上和思想上的灵感。这些南斯拉夫修正主义者——叛徒们在阿拉伯国家里的活动具有特别的破坏性和有利于美帝国主义。
    巴格达什说，叙利亚共产党在自己历史上已第四次转入了地下活动。但是我们的党并未脱离人民。他最后说，我们可以向你们保证，任何一种力量也不能从我们手中夺去在叙利亚的马克思列宁主义大旗，因为我们人民从自己切身的经验中确认，这是真正爱国主义的、真正社会主义的大旗，并且是必然获得胜利的大旗。
