Jilin Normal University Mathematics Department Teachers and Students Go Deep into Factories and Mines
Find Mathematical Research Topics from Production

This newspaper reports that more than 600 students from the second, third, and fourth grades of the Mathematics Department of Jilin Normal University, along with some teachers, focusing on teaching, have gone deep into factories, mines, enterprises, and scientific research institutions in Changchun, Jilin, Siping and other places to investigate mathematical problems in actual production and carry out mass scientific research activities. This has powerfully solved the problem of how higher mathematics can be linked to reality and has promoted teaching work.

In the past, some people in the Mathematics Department of Jilin Normal University believed that "mathematics is an abstract science and cannot be linked to reality at all," or that "elementary mathematics can be linked to actual production, but higher mathematics cannot." After going deep into reality, this view changed. In actual production, there are not only a large number of mathematical problems, but also many higher mathematics problems that directly serve production. The Mathematics Department has found more than 400 topics worth studying.

After going deep into actual production, the problems that teachers and students encountered most were higher mathematics such as differential equations, computational mathematics, probability theory, and operations research. However, because mathematics was divorced from reality in the past, these courses were not emphasized. Therefore, in the initial stage of going deep into reality, it was generally difficult to find topics. But after a period of study, repeated research and exploration, and improved analytical skills, they extracted valuable higher mathematical problems from complex production for research. Fourth-year students participating in the study of grid refinement problems at the Changchun Hydroelectric Power Design Institute, in order to calculate the stress of the head dam of the Longwangmiao Hydropower Station to be built in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, learned differential equations, mechanics, quasi-differential integrals, and mathematical physics in a short period of time using the method of learning by doing. They also studied the famous Soviet mathematical works "Lagrange Interpolation" and approximation theory, thereby accurately calculating the stress of the head dam of the Longwangmiao Dam, which has now been adopted by the Changchun Hydroelectric Power Design Institute. Seven fourth-year students, including Yu Shenghai, studied differential equations and other subjects chapter by chapter to research the "Erect Pole Tower" construction manual for the Changchun Electric Power Design Institute. They calculated some problems over three or four thousand times without success. However, after discussion, recognizing that this research was of great significance to production and construction, they tenaciously continued to study and finally found a new method, completing the task a week ahead of schedule.

Learning in conjunction with practice, students have made rapid progress. In order to complete production tasks, students have clear learning objectives, great enthusiasm, and fast speed. Some groups finished reading "Operations Research" in two days. Some mathematical knowledge had not been learned, so they adopted a blitz method, finding books, looking up materials, reading and discussing collectively, concentrating everyone's wisdom, or collaborating with veteran workers. Knowledge that used to take several months to learn was learned in a few days, which exercised the students' learning will.

Learning mathematics in conjunction with actual production, students have gained a more profound and systematic theoretical knowledge. In just over two months, they completed more than 230 research topics closely related to actual production. According to preliminary review and acceptance by relevant production units, more than 30 of them are major or cutting-edge issues. In the past, the department had always wanted to start a publication, but had not been able to do so because it could not produce scientific papers. Now, in just two months, it has published two collections, writing more than 200 papers and reports. Based on the information learned from going deep into practice, it has now been decided to add 16 courses such as differential equations and computational mathematics, establish a computational technology major, and train talents and teachers for manufacturing electronic computers. They also compiled a new set of textbooks combining geometry and trigonometry in cooperation with students, workers, technicians, and teachers, based on the workers' suggestions.

Recently, after the entire department of teachers and students summarized this scientific research work in conjunction with practice, they generally felt that the knowledge they had learned in the past was too little. Now, whether in the classroom or outside of class, they are actively and proactively studying theory. Many students are studying and improving learning methods and have proposed various plans to strengthen theoretical learning. (Wang Wenlian)

    吉林师大数学系师生深入工厂矿山
    从生产中找出数学研究课题
    本报讯　吉林师范大学数学系二、三、四年级六百余名学生和部分教师，以教学为中心，分别深入到长春、吉林、四平等地厂矿、企业和科学研究机关中，调查生产实际中的数学问题，开展群众性科学研究活动，有力地解决了高等数学如何联系实际的问题，推动了教学工作。
    过去，吉林师范大学数学系曾有人认为“数学是一门抽象的科学，根本不能联系实际”，或者说：“初等数学可以联系生产实际，但高等数学就不可能”，经过深入实际以后，这种观念改变了。生产实际中，不仅存在着大量的数学问题，而且也有不少直接为生产服务的高等数学问题，数学系前后找到四百多个有研究价值的题目。
    深入生产实际以后，师生们碰到最多的问题，是微分方程、计算数学、概率论、运筹学等高等数学。但这些课程由于过去数学脱离实际，没有重视。因而在深入实际的初期，普遍感到找题困难。但经过一段学习，反复研究、探讨，提高了分析能力以后，便从复杂的生产中，抽出有价值的高级数学问题进行研究。参加长春水力发电设计院研究网格法加细问题的四年级学生，为了给即将在松花江上游兴建的龙王庙水力发电站大头坝计算应力，用边学边做的方法，短时期内学习了微分方程、力学、似微分积分、数学物理，还学习了苏联有名的数学著作“拉格朗日内插法”和逼近论，从而精确地计算出龙王庙水坝大头坝的应力，现已为长春水力发电设计院采用。四年级于胜海等七名学生，为长春电力设计院研究“正立杆塔”施工手册时，曾经对某些问题，演算到三、四千次以上，不得要领。但是经过讨论，认识到这种研究对生产建设有重大意义时，便顽强地继续钻研，并分段分章地学习了微分方程等，终于找到了新的方法，提前一周完成了任务。
    结合实际学习，学生进步很快。为了完成生产任务，学生的学习目的明确，劲头大，速度快。有的小组用两天时间看完了“运筹学”，有些数学知识没有学过，便采用突击方法，找书本，翻资料，集体阅读，讨论，集中大家的智慧，或与老工人协作，把以前要几个月才能学完的知识，在几天内学完了，锻炼了学生的学习意志。
    结合生产实际学习数学，学生们获得的理论知识比较深刻系统。仅两个多月，就完成了二百三十多项密切联系生产实际的研究题目，据初步审查和有关生产单位验收，其中有三十多项属于重大的或尖端问题。过去系里一直想筹办一个刊物，但总因提不出科学论文而未能实现。现在短短两个月中便出版了两期集刊，写出论文和报告二百多篇。根据深入实际了解的情况，现决定增设微分方程、计算数学等十六门课程，设立计算技术专业，培养制造电子计算机人材和师资。他们还根据工人的建议，由学生与工人、技术人员、教师合作，编写出一套几何与三角结合在一起的新教材。
    最近，全系师生总结了这次结合实际的科学研究工作以后，普遍感到过去学到的知识太少。现在，他们无论在课堂或课外，都积极主动钻研理论，不少学生正在研究改进学习方法，并提出了各种方案，以加强理论学习。　　　　　　　　（王文琏）
