    Wife's Singing
    Lin Guangxu, Commune Member of Pandong Commune, Jieyang, Guangdong
    One evening at dusk, my wife and I left the canteen, chatting as we walked home. As soon as we reached the door, several children suddenly surrounded us:
    "Dad, sing us a song!"
    "I can't!" I shook my head.
    "Can't sing? The kindergarten teacher says everyone should sing. How can't you sing?" The children pouted, their faces full of displeasure.
    I was stunned for a moment, blushing, not knowing how to answer. Suddenly, my wife interjected:
    "Don't be noisy, don't be noisy, Mom will sing for you."
    "Socialism is good...", the song flowed out like a small river. After only singing the first two lines, the children joined in, singing loudly. The commune had only been established for a short time, and my wife already loved to sing again.
    When I married her, she was a lively and cheerful girl, and she liked to hum tunes. She helped me hoe the fields and operate the waterwheel, and I helped her carry water and feed the pigs, and everyone was very happy. But with the birth of the first, second, and third child, she gradually stopped liking to sing.
    To be honest, it was hard to blame her. There was only me in the fields, and only her at home. In order for me to go to work early, she had to get up before dawn to fetch water, cook, and feed the pigs. The three children were clingy and demanding. This one wanted milk, that one wanted a bath, the little one needed to be held, the big one was afraid of falling into the pond, one was clamoring for food, and another was making a fuss to play... She was swamped.
    "Long arms, short sleeves, shallow water, fish collide." She was too busy, her mood was not good, and her temper was not as good as before.
    After the establishment of the commune, public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens were established one after another. She was extremely happy. She didn't have to cook, and she didn't have to worry about the children. Every day, she and I went to work and got off work on time. In this way, she quickly worked with the women in the team and engaged in recreational activities together.
    It was this happy life that brought my wife endless songs! (Attached picture)

    妻子的歌声
    广东揭阳盘东公社社员　林光续
    一天黄昏，我和妻子离开食堂，谈谈说说地往回走。刚到家门，几个孩子突然围上来：
    “爸爸，唱个歌给我们听听！”
    “不会！”我摇摇头。
    “不会唱？幼儿园阿姨说，人人都要唱歌。你怎么不会唱？”孩子们撅着嘴，满脸不高兴。
    我一时给楞住了，红着脸，不知怎样回答好。突然，妻子接上说：
    “勿吵勿吵，妈妈给你们唱。”
    “社会主义好……”，歌声像小河水似地淌开来。才唱过头两句，孩子们就接着放声合唱。公社建立才多久呀！我的妻子又喜欢唱歌了。
    我结婚时，她是个活活泼泼的姑娘，也喜欢哼歌儿。她帮我锄地、车水，我帮她挑水、喂猪，大家都很高兴。但是，随着第一个、第二个、第三个孩子的诞生，她逐渐就不喜欢唱了。
    说实在，这也很难怪她。田里只我一个，家里只她一个。为了让我早出工，她得天未亮就起床去挑水、煮饭、喂猪，三个孩子又是缠脚粘手，这个要吃奶，那个要洗澡，小的要抱，大的怕跌落池塘，有的吵要吃，有的闹要玩，……把她忙得团团转。
    “手长衣袖短，水浅鱼相撞”，她忙不过来，心情不舒畅，性情也就没以前那么好。
    公社建立后，接着又成立了公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园。她，高兴极了。她不用煮饭，不用为孩子耽心了。每天，她和我同样地按时出勤，按时收工。这样，她很快地就和队里的妇女一道劳动，在一块搞文娱活动。
    正是这样欢快的生活，给我的妻子带来了唱不完的歌！（附图片）
