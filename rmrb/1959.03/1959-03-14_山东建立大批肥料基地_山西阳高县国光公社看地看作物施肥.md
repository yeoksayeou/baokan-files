Jinan, March 13th (By our reporter) According to the directives from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council regarding the launch of a fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, people's communes in Shandong have constructed a large number of livestock sheds and pens, field-side fertilizer pits, and local chemical fertilizer plants in the fields. These permanent fertilizer accumulation facilities have formed a network of fertilizer bases scattered across the fields in some areas. According to statistics from Fan County, Zhucheng, Rizhao, Shouzhang, Pingyuan, and Wulian Counties alone, over 1.5 million new field-side fertilizer pits, more than 5,000 field livestock sheds and pens, and over 7,000 field-side local chemical fertilizer plants were built during the fertilizer accumulation surge before and after the Spring Festival.

The construction of these facilities in various locations starts from the establishment of permanent fertilizer bases. Therefore, scientific planning was conducted in advance based on the principles of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and construction was adapted to local conditions based on the needs of crops and objective conditions. For example, Pingyuan County demarcated areas on over 500,000 mu of saline-alkali slopes to establish simple local chemical fertilizer plants, using natural alkaline soil to produce nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers on the spot. Shouzhang and Fan Counties planned to build a pig farm for every 1,000 mu or so, with one pig per mu, and a manure pit for every three to five pigs. In the mountainous areas of Wulian, livestock were moved to the mountains, pens were built on the mountains, and fertilizer was applied on the spot. All these plants, pens, pits, and pools are assigned to specific personnel responsible for regularly and consistently supplying "food" to crops in a specific quality, quantity, and area.

The measures taken by Shandong to establish a fertilizer base network in the fields have greatly saved labor and animal power in fertilizer transportation. Distant areas can also obtain sufficient fertilizer. Moving livestock to the fields or mountains facilitates work and improves village sanitation.

These areas are now taking further measures to strengthen the consolidation of the fertilizer base network. (Hu Lei, Lü Xingkui)

Taiyuan, March 13th (By our reporter) The Guoguang People's Commune in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, has begun to implement fertilizer application based on land and crops, greatly enhancing the yield-increasing effect of fertilizers.

Between November of last year and January of this year, the commune conducted two general surveys and analyses of the soil quality, fertility, and acidity/alkalinity of over 5,000 mu of cultivated land and over 6,000 mu of wasteland. At the same time, they summarized the effective experiences accumulated by farmers over the years in improving soil, planting according to local conditions, and applying fertilizer rationally. This provided a basis for applying fertilizer based on land conditions. For example, pig manure is applied to yellow soil slopes and sandy shale slopes, cattle, horse, mule, and donkey manure are applied to saline-alkali wetlands, and sheep manure is applied to orchards. Simultaneously, based on the experience that "adding a layer of skin to the soil is equivalent to adding a layer of fertilizer," they vigorously carried out soil inversion and replacement, turning various types of soil into fertilizer and transporting it to the fields. For example, 12,000 cartloads of cohesive yellow soil have been applied to 405 mu of sandy soil lacking a granular structure, and 15,000 cartloads of "Kou Tou" soil, which can loosen the soil, have been applied to over 500 mu of excessively sticky clay soil. A layer of beach soil has also been universally spread on sloping land with less organic matter.

Based on the principle that crops need more nitrogen fertilizer in the early stages and an appropriate amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer in the later stages, 80 to 120 jin of nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer is added to the base fertilizer for yam, corn, millet, sorghum, and wheat crops. During topdressing, a suitable amount of stove soil and plant ash, which contain more phosphorus and potassium, is added.

In terms of topdressing methods, in addition to the 3,300 mu that underwent layered fertilization in conjunction with deep plowing last autumn, the Guoguang Commune will also change the long-standing habit of large-scale spreading and adopt scientific fertilization methods such as furrow application and hole application this year. This will not only achieve the effect of concentrated fertilization but also avoid losing fertilizer effectiveness.

In order to popularize fertilizer knowledge and master rational fertilization techniques among the masses, the commune has specifically organized fertilizer training courses. The more than 60 deputy technical team leaders who participated in the training have basically mastered the application of different fertilizers based on land and crops.

### 山东建立大批肥料基地  山西阳高县国光公社看地看作物施肥

    山东建立大批肥料基地
    山西阳高县国光公社看地看作物施肥
    本报济南13日电　山东各人民公社根据中共中央、国务院关于开展积肥造肥运动的指示，在田间修建了大批的畜棚畜圈、田头造肥坑以及土化肥厂。这些永久性的积肥设备，在部分地区的田野里，已经形成一个星罗棋布的肥料基地网。仅据范县、诸城、日照、寿张、平原、五莲等六个县的统计，在春节前后的积肥浪潮中，即新建田头造肥坑一百五十多万个，田间畜棚畜圈五千多处，田间土化肥厂七千多处。
    各地修建这些设备，都是从建设永久性的肥料基地出发的。因此在事先都根据多快好省的原则，作了科学的规划，并且是因地制宜根据农作物的需要和客观条件去建设。如平原县在五十多万亩大硷坡上，划方划片建立简易土化肥厂，利用天然碱土，就地制造氮肥和磷肥；寿张、范县规划千亩左右建一猪场，一亩地有一头猪，三、五头猪修一圈粪坑。五莲山区实行移畜上山，就山建圈，就地施肥。所有这些厂、圈、坑、池，都固定专人负责，定时定质定量定地片，经常不断地为农作物供应“食粮”。
    山东各地在田间建立肥料基地网的措施，大大节省了运肥的大批劳、畜力；远地也可以得到充足的肥料；牲畜迁往田间或山上，使役方便，村庄卫生。
    现在这些地区，正在进一步采取措施，加强肥料基地网的巩固工作。　　　　　（胡雷、吕兴魁）
    本报太原13日电　山西省阳高县国光人民公社开始实行因地因作物施肥，大大发挥了肥料的增产作用。
    去年11月和今年1月间，这个公社对五千多亩耕地和六千多亩荒地的土质、肥力、酸碱度，进行过两次普查、化验。同时，总结了农民多年来行之有效的改良土壤、因地种植、合理施肥等方面的经验。这就使得因地施肥有了依据。例如，把猪粪施在黄土坡地、砂板坡地，把牛马骡驴粪施到盐碱湿地，把羊粪施到果林里。同时，还根据“土加一层皮，顶上一层肥”的经验，大力进行了倒土换土，使各种各样的土也变成肥料而运到地里。如在四百零五亩缺乏团粒结构的砂质地上，已经施入了一万二千车富有粘性的黄土，在五百多亩粘性太大的澄泥地上，则施入了一万五千车可以疏松土壤的“口头土”，还在有机质较少的坡地，普遍撒了一层滩土。
    根据作物早期需要氮肥多，晚期适当需要磷钾肥的规律，在种植山药、玉米、谷子、高粱、小麦等作物的底肥中，加施八十到一百二十斤固氮菌肥。而追肥时则适当加含磷含钾较多的灶土、草木灰。
    在追肥方法上，除去年秋天有三千三百亩结合深翻进行分层施肥外，今年国光公社对于多年来相沿成习的大铺大撒，也将加以改变，而采用垅施、窝施等科学施肥方法，这不但可以收到集中施肥的效果，还可以避免失去肥效。
    为了在群众中普及肥料知识、掌握合理施肥技术，公社专门举办了肥料训练班。参加训练的六十多名技术副队长，已经基本上掌握了因地因作物施用不同肥料。
