Working Style: Hardworking and In-depth; Work: Down-to-earth
Ningxiang, Hunan Cadres Closely Connect with the Masses

(Our report) This reporter, Li Qinyuan, reports: The broad masses of cadres in Ningxiang County, Hunan, have further developed a hardworking and in-depth work style in spring plowing production, and have more closely connected with the masses. Because cadres at all levels lead production in labor, they have encouraged the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses, setting off a high tide of spring plowing production.
    The Ningxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always attached importance to the connection between cadres and the masses. Over the years, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been harmonious. According to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, starting from the end of last year, it has once again emphasized strengthening the connection between cadres and the masses. At various meetings held by the County Party Committee, it is necessary to check the work style of cadres every time, commend a group of good cadres who are hardworking, in-depth, and connect with the masses, and select the deeds of model cadres to launch discussions and studies among the broad masses of cadres, and compare and check their own work style. At the same time, the leading comrades of the County Party Committee personally took the lead in setting an example. Li Xueliang, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, often labored and produced with the peasants barefoot, bareheaded, and dressed in peasant clothes, which had a good influence on cadres and the masses. One day, Comrade Li Xueliang came to the second canteen of the Zhenzhou Production Team. As soon as he entered the canteen, he busied himself helping the chef chop vegetables, asking them if they were used to it, what difficulties they had, and how the commune members were living. Then, he cleaned the kitchen inside and out with the cooks. His actions boosted the cooks' confidence in doing a good job in the service industry. Under the leading influence of the County Party Committee, many cadres also consciously corrected some of the shortcomings that originally existed, closely united with the masses, and greatly promoted a down-to-earth work style.
    The further closeness of the relationship between cadres and the masses is also due to the continued adherence to planting experimental plots. Up to now, 94% of the cadres in the county have planted experimental plots, and planting experimental plots has developed from hills to fields, from single experiments to multiple experiments, forming an experimental network. In order to plant the experimental plots better, the County Party Committee also organized a county-wide inspection, evaluation, and competition of experimental plots, proposing three comparisons (comparing quantity, comparing quality, comparing promoting production) and three priorities (cadre reports first talk about experimental plots, inspection and evaluation first evaluate experimental plots, promotion of advanced technology first promotes experimental plots). Under the leadership of the cadres, the masses rose up to compete for the first place. Up to now, more than 96,000 commune members have planted experimental plots, an increase of 90% over last year. Planting experimental plots has made the work of cadres more in-depth and the level of leadership has been continuously improved.
    In order to further strengthen the connection between cadres and the masses, the County Party Committee also organized cadres to carry out the "Five Goods" cadre evaluation and competition. The five goods are: good mass line, good labor production, good ideological style, good implementation of policies, and good completion of tasks. The development of this movement has formed a climax among cadres in which everyone learns "Five Goods" and everyone strives for "Five Goods." The cadres all strictly checked their work according to the conditions of the "Five Goods". In order to place cadres directly under the supervision of the masses, the County Party Committee also decided that in addition to internal evaluation among cadres, the "Five Goods" cadres should also be regularly evaluated by the masses. Because the masses cherish and care for the cadres, they enthusiastically praise good cadres and also criticize the shortcomings of some comrades by name. Some cadres who were not rated as "Five Goods" for the first time guaranteed to the masses and leaders that they would strive to be "Five Goods" next time, and a strong atmosphere of striving for the top was created. Cheng Yingqing, a member of the Party Committee of Baimaqiao Commune, worked in the Yaoshi Brigade. When evaluating "Five Goods" cadres, the masses said to him, Comrade Cheng, you are good at everything else, but one morning, we all went into the water to turn over the paddies, but you were afraid of the cold and didn't go down, so you only meet the conditions for "Four Goods". From then on, Cheng Yingqing changed his work style and actively took the lead in participating in production. In the second evaluation, the masses said that he met the conditions for "Five Goods" cadres. In this mass evaluation, 67% of the 4,829 cadres in the county were rated as "Five Goods" cadres.

    作风艰苦深入  工作踏踏实实
    湖南宁乡干部密切联系群众
    本报讯　记者李沁源报道：湖南宁乡县广大干部在春耕生产中，进一步发扬了艰苦深入的工作作风，更加密切地联系了群众。由于各级干部在劳动中领导生产，鼓舞了广大群众的冲天干劲，掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    中共宁乡县委一贯重视干部同群众的联系，历年来，干群关系是融洽的。根据党的八届六中全会的精神，从去年年底开始，又再一次强调了加强干部同群众的联系。在县委召开的各种会议上，每次都要检查干部作风，表扬一批艰苦深入、联系群众的好干部，并选择模范干部的事迹，在广大干部中展开讨论学习，对照检查自己的工作作风。与此同时，县委领导同志还亲自带头做出榜样。县委第一书记李学良同志，赤脚光头，身着农民服装，经常与农民一起劳动生产，在干部和群众中起了良好的影响。一天，李学良同志来到了珍洲生产队第二食堂，一进食堂就忙着帮厨师切菜，问他们习惯不习惯，有什么困难，社员生活过得怎样。接着，就和炊事员一道把厨房前后打扫得干干净净。他的行动鼓舞了炊事员们搞好服务事业的信心。在县委的带头影响下，许多干部也自觉地改正了原来存在的一些缺点，密切的同群众在一起，踏实的工作作风大大发扬。
    干群关系进一步的密切，也是由于继续坚持种试验田的结果。到目前为止，全县94％的干部种了试验田，并且种试验田由丘发展到片，由单一试验发展到多种试验，形成了试验网。为了把试验田种的更好，县委还组织了全县范围的试验田检查评比竞赛，提出三比（比数量、比质量、比推动生产）、三先（干部汇报先谈试验田、检查评比先评试验田、推广先进技术先推广试验田）。在干部的带动下，群众奋起争先，至目前止，有九万六千多社员种了试验田，比去年增加了90％。种了试验田，使干部工作更加深入，领导水平不断提高。
    为了进一步密切干部同群众的联系，县委还组织干部开展了“五好”干部评比竞赛。五好是：群众路线好、劳动生产好、思想作风好、贯彻政策好、完成任务好。开展这个运动，在干部中形成了人人学“五好”，个个争“五好”的高潮。干部们都按照“五好”的条件来严格检查自己的工作。为了把干部直接置于群众监督之下，县委还决定除了干部内部进行评比外，还定期把“五好”干部交由群众去评定。由于群众爱护干部，关怀干部，他们热情地表扬好干部，也指名道姓的批评某些同志的缺点。有些干部第一次没有评上“五好”，就向群众和领导保证下一次争取当“五好”，一种争上游的风气非常浓厚。白马桥公社党委委员成映晴在腰市大队工作，评选“五好”干部时，群众对他说，成同志，你别的都好，就是有一天早晨，我们都下水去翻凼子，你怕冷没有下去，只够“四好”条件。从此以后，成映晴改变了作风，积极带头参加生产，第二次评定时，群众说他够“五好”干部的条件了。在这次群众评选中，全县四千八百二十九个干部，有67％被评为“五好”干部。
