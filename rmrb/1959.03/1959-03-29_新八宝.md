    New Eight Treasures
    Zhou Da

    "Eight Treasures" was originally a popular auspicious pattern, using eight different miscellaneous objects as themes, taking their shape or borrowing their sound, adorned with ribbons fluttering in the wind, organized into a set of patterns that are both varied and unified. It can be square or round, highly adaptable, and highly decorative. It is widely used in architecture, furniture, brocade, and daily utensils, becoming a symbol of auspiciousness and a decoration that the masses are most familiar with and love to see.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, many miracles have been created by the masses. In our actual life, there are not only new "Eight Treasures," but also thousands of treasures, becoming the symbols and pride of the material and spiritual life of our era. For a long time, I have felt that these new contents should be reflected in decorative art. For example, in our current life (even in a considerable period to come), the three marshals (steel, grain, machinery), the three pioneers (hydropower, coal mining, transportation), and the two cutting edges (atomic energy science and construction mechanization) that are often mentioned are all central tasks for which millions of people in our era are striving, and they are the symbols of production level and living standards. It should become our new "Eight Treasures." Based on the above ideas, I tried to use traditional techniques, with ribbons or with clouds, to form new auspicious patterns with these eight different themes, the so-called New Eight Treasures (see picture). It can be used alone or in combination with other patterns. Its characteristic is that it is unidirectional, suitable for ribbon decoration, and can be used for architectural decoration, decoration of daily utensils, etc. If eight are used, it can be called "Eight Treasures"; if the three marshals are used, it can be called "Three Treasures"; and it can even be developed into ten treasures or even a hundred treasures. The flexibility is great.

    This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. In order to celebrate the National Day, there are more and larger design and production tasks for arts and crafts than in previous years. How to make the new arts and crafts products have both the new socialist content and the traditional national style is a very important issue. The creation of the New Eight Treasures is my first attempt in this regard. There are many shortcomings in both the selection of materials and the expression methods, for example, it does not have the same meaning as the original auspicious patterns.

    I believe that reflecting new content in arts and crafts cannot be the same as drawing, let alone rigidly apply certain serious political symbols. Using the techniques of many auspicious patterns in folk art to reflect certain new content is one of the more appropriate forms.

    新八宝
    周达
    八宝原是民间吉祥图案的一种，以八种不同的杂物为题材，取其形或借其声，饰以随风飞舞的绶带，组织成一组既有变化又能统一的图案。可方可圆，适应性大，装饰性强。在建筑、家具、织锦和日用器皿中，得到广泛的应用，成为吉祥的象征，是群众最熟悉最乐见的一种装饰。
    1958年社会主义大跃进以来，在党的领导下，许多奇迹被群众创造出来。在我们的实际生活中，不但有新的“八宝”，而且有千万种宝，成为我们这个时代的物质生活和精神生活的标志和骄傲。很久以来，我就感到这些新内容应该在装饰艺术中得到应有的反应。例如在我们目前生活中（甚至在今后一个相当时期），经常要提到的三大元帅（钢铁、粮食、机械），三位先行（水电、采煤、运输），和两个尖端（原子能科学和建筑机械化），都是我们这个时代的千百万人为之奋斗的中心任务，是生产水平和生活水平的标志。它应该成为我们的新“八宝”。我根据以上的想法，试将这八种不同的题材，利用传统的手法，用绶带，或用行云，组成了新的吉祥图案，即所谓新八宝（见图）。它可以单独的运用，亦可与其他图案结合运用。它的特点是单方向的，适用于带状装饰，可用于建筑装饰，用于日用器皿的装饰等。如果用八个可称八宝，如用三大元帅可称三宝，更可以发展成为十宝以至百宝。灵活性是很大的。
    今年是我们伟大祖国建国十年大庆，为了向国庆献礼，有比往年更多更大的工艺美术品的设计和生产任务，如何使新的工艺美术品既有社会主义的新内容，又有传统的民族风格，这是一个很重要的问题。新八宝的创作，是我在这方面的初次尝试。不论在取材上或表现方法上，都有很多缺点，比如它不像原来吉祥图案那样寓意等。
    我认为在工艺美术方面反映新内容不能与绘图相同，更不能把某些严肃的政治表号生搬硬套。而运用民间艺术中许多吉祥图案的手法来体现某些新内容是比较适宜的形式之一。
