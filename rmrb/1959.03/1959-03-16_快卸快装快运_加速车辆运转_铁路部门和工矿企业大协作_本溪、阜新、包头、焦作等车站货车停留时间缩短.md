Xinhua News Agency, March 15th – The vast railway workers, working diligently day and night on the railway transportation lines, are actively tapping the transportation potential of existing vehicles with a fighting spirit of quick unloading, quick loading, and quick transportation. Stations in key iron and steel enterprises and coal mining areas such as Benxi, Fuxin, Beipiao, Luotuo Ying, Tangshan, Baotou, Jiaozuo, and Daye Tieshan have achieved preliminary results in this struggle to "gain vehicles from time." Since March, the dwell time of each freight car at these stations has been shortened by 0.1 to 1.8 hours compared to the original plan, which is equivalent to contributing a considerable number of freight cars to the country. The accelerated vehicle turnover has also promoted the production of these factories and mines, such as the timely transportation of steel and coal, and the import of raw materials.

These stations have been able to shorten freight car dwell time and speed up vehicle turnaround, mainly due to two experiences: one is that under the unified leadership of the Party committees in various places, close cooperation between railway transportation departments and industrial and mining enterprises has been implemented. Each station and factory and mine jointly formulated transportation plans, and notified the factory and mine enterprises in advance when sending and picking up vehicles, fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of "vehicles waiting for people" and "people waiting for vehicles." Under the leadership and organization of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the local station and coal mine established a transportation high-yield command, which unified the leadership of ten aspects of work such as planning, scheduling, systems, and inspection, so that the loading and unloading of vehicles in this coal mining area has been going very well. In the past, Benxi Iron and Steel Company often did not have enough loading and unloading workers during busy transportation periods. Since Benxi City unified the use of locomotives and loading and unloading labor from factories and mines, this problem has been solved.

The other is that these stations pay attention to mobilizing the masses of employees to grasp the transportation plan on a daily and hourly basis. Because Tangshan Station implemented a method of checking and estimating every three hours, summarizing every six hours, and concluding every nine hours on the completion of the daily plan, it ensured that each shift completed the plan successfully. In early March, this station not only completed the loading and unloading tasks outstandingly and shortened the dwell time, but also ensured that more than 100 trains a day were on time every day and every train.

This year, China's railway transportation task is heavy, and there is a great shortage of freight cars. Therefore, shortening the dwell and transit time of vehicles is an important measure to tap the potential of existing vehicles and solve the above contradictions. According to calculations by the Ministry of Railways, if the dwell time of freight cars across the country is shortened by half an hour, it is equivalent to adding about 1,400 freight cars to the country. More than 30 stations in China are located in key coal mining areas and iron and steel enterprise factory areas. The freight volume and the number of vehicles occupied by these stations account for a large proportion of the country. In the past, many stations did not do enough in transportation organization work, and these mining areas often had the phenomenon of "six waitings" (i.e., waiting for train disintegration, marshalling, picking up vehicles, sending vehicles, loading vehicles, unloading vehicles). This was detrimental to both railway transportation and factory and mine production. The practices of Benxi, Fuxin, Beipiao, Luotuo Ying, Tangshan, Baotou, Jiaozuo and other stations in shortening the dwell time of vehicles provide some useful experience for solving this problem.

### 快卸快装快运　加速车辆运转  铁路部门和工矿企业大协作  本溪、阜新、包头、焦作等车站货车停留时间缩短

    快卸快装快运　加速车辆运转
    铁路部门和工矿企业大协作
    本溪、阜新、包头、焦作等车站货车停留时间缩短
    新华社15日讯　日夜紧张地工作在铁路运输线上的广大铁路职工，正以快卸、快装、快运的战斗姿态，积极挖掘现有车辆的运输潜力，本溪、阜新、北票、骆驼营、唐山、包头、焦作、大冶铁山等重点钢铁企业和煤矿区的车站，在这场“向时间要车”的斗争中，取得了初步成就。3月份以来，每辆货车在这些车站的停留时间，都比原定计划缩短了零点一小时到一点八小时，这等于为国家献出了相当数量的货车车辆。车辆运转加快后，对于这些厂矿的生产，如及时运出钢铁、煤炭，运进原材料，也起了促进作用。
    这些车站能够缩短货车停留时间，加快车辆周转，主要经验有二：一个是各地在党委的统一领导下，实行了铁路运输部门和工矿企业的大协作。各站和厂矿共同制订运输计划，向厂矿区送车、取车时，都事先通知厂矿企业，从根本上改变了过去“车等人”、“人等车”的现象。在中共阜新市委的领导和组织下，当地车站和煤矿成立了运输高产指挥部，统一领导计划、调度、制度、检查等十个方面的工作，使这个煤矿区的装、卸车一直进行得很好。本溪钢铁公司过去在运输繁忙的时候，装卸工人往往不够用，自从本溪市把厂矿企业的机车、装卸劳动力等统一使用后，这个问题迎刃而解。
    另一个是这些车站注意发动职工群众，按日按时抓运输计划。唐山车站由于对每天计划完成的情况实行了三小时检查和推算一次、六小时小结一次、九小时总结一次的办法，因而保证班班完成了计划。这个车站3月上旬不仅出色地完成了装车、卸车任务，缩短了停车时间，而且每天一百多趟列车都能做到天天、列列正点。
    今年我国铁路运输任务繁重，货车很感不足。因此，缩短车辆的停留和中转时间，是挖掘现有车辆潜力、解决以上矛盾的一个重要措施。据铁道部计算，全国货车车辆停留时间如缩短半小时，就等于为国家增加约一千四百辆货车。我国有三十多个车站位于重点煤矿区和钢铁企业厂区，这些车站的货运量和占用的车辆，都占全国很大比重，过去，许多车站因为运输组织工作作得不够，这些矿厂区常常存在着“六等待”的现象（即等待列车解体、编组、取车、送车、装车、卸车、）这对铁路运输和厂矿生产都不利。本溪、阜新、北票、骆驼营、唐山、包头、焦作等站缩短停车时间的作法，为解决这个问题提供了一些有益的经验。
