International Public Opinion on the Situation in the United Arab Republic and Iraq
UAR's Anti-Iraq Actions Please Imperialism
Some Indian newspapers publish commentaries
Attacking Iraq as detrimental to anti-imperialist unity
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 18th. Some Indian newspapers have expressed deep concern about the recent events in which the United Arab Republic launched attacks against the Republic of Iraq.

The Bengali newspaper "Yugantar" (Epoch) said on the 17th that this situation "has caused great unease and concern among many well-intentioned people in India and Asia." The newspaper said that these developments were happening at a time when "the people of Asia were expecting Cairo and Baghdad to guide the revolution towards a more perfect democracy."

The newspaper pointed out that UAR President Nasser's incitement of religious fanaticism to attack Iraq and playing this role is fraught with serious dangers because it "strengthens the forces of reaction in the Middle East" and "divides and weakens Arab nationalism and democratic forces."

The "Bombay Chronicle" pointed out that "only conservatives, ultra-reactionaries, and reactionaries everywhere are pleased" with the situation caused by the actions of the UAR.

The Bengali newspaper "Azad" (Freedom) called on the UAR to recognize that this attack on Iraq is detrimental to Arab anti-imperialist unity and pleases imperialism.

An Italian right-wing newspaper
Expresses pleasure at Nasser's anti-communism
Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 19th. The Italian right-wing newspaper "Il Tempo" expressed pleasure on the 17th at the recent speech by United Arab Republic President Nasser attacking Arab communists and international communism. The newspaper said that Western countries, due to "where their interests lie," are clearly going to "help Nasser."

The newspaper clearly pointed out that if Nasser wants to pursue a policy of anti-communism and forcefully "unifying" Arab countries, he cannot maintain an equal distance from both camps.

Cambodian "Ekareach" Points out
The affairs of Iraq should be solved by Iraq itself
Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 19th. The Cambodian newspaper "Ekareach" (Independence) pointed out on the 18th, in a commentary on the Mosul rebellion in Iraq, that the leaders of the United Arab Republic participated in the recent rebellion in Mosul. It also said that the imperialists exploited this event.

In analyzing the causes of this rebellion, the newspaper said that it was due to the imperialists' attempt to regain control of Iraq and the attempt by some Arab chauvinists to incorporate Iraq into the United Arab Republic. The newspaper said that the affairs of Iraq should be solved by Iraq itself, and no country should engage in incitement, as this violates the United Nations Charter and the will of all nations.

Pakistani "Leader" Expresses Regret at Nasser's Threats
Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 18th. The Karachi evening newspaper "The Leader" said in today's editorial that "all level-headed people regret President Nasser's terrible threat to organize a series of meaningless bloody actions against the Republic of Iraq."

Commenting on Nasser's recent speech in Damascus, "The Leader" said that Nasser's activities became more obvious in the Mosul rebellion. The newspaper continued, "If anyone had any doubts," then those doubts should have disappeared after he "delivered a fiery speech" in Damascus.

    各国舆论评阿联和伊拉克的局势
    阿联反伊使帝国主义高兴
    印度一些报纸发表评论
    攻击伊拉克不利反帝团结
    新华社新德里18日电　印度一些报纸对阿拉伯联合共和国最近发动的反对伊拉克共和国的事件，表示深切的忧虑。
    孟加拉文日报“划时代报”在17日说，这种情况“已经在印度和亚洲的许多好心人中间引起了巨大的不安和忧虑。”这家报纸说，这是因为这些事态发展是发生在“亚洲人民正在期望着开罗和巴格达把革命引导到更加完善的民主的道路上去的时候。”
    这家报纸指出，阿联总统纳赛尔煽动宗教狂热来攻击伊拉克，扮演这种角色是充满着严重的危险的。因为它“加强了中东反动分子的力量”，“分裂和削弱了阿拉伯民族主义和民主力量”。
    “孟买纪事报”指出，对于由于阿联的行动而引起的局势，“只有各地的保守分子、极端顽固分子和反动分子才感到高兴”。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”要求阿联认识到，对伊拉克的这种攻击是不利于阿拉伯人的反帝团结的，是使帝国主义高兴的。
    意大利一家右翼报纸
    对纳赛尔反共表示高兴
    新华社19日讯　罗马消息：意大利右翼报纸“时代报”17日对阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔最近所发表的攻击阿拉伯共产党人和国际共产主义的演说表示高兴，这家报纸说，西方国家由于“利益的所在”显然是要“帮助纳赛尔”的。
    这家报纸明白指出，纳赛尔要推行反共和强力“统一”阿拉伯各国的政策，他就不可能保持同两个阵营的同等距离。
    柬埔寨“统一报”指出
    伊拉克的事应由伊拉克自己解决
    新华社金边19日电　柬埔寨的“统一报”18日在评论伊拉克摩苏尔叛乱事件时指出，阿拉伯联合共和国的领导人参与了最近在摩苏尔发生的叛乱。它还说，帝国主义者利用了这个事件。
    报纸在分析这次叛乱的原因时说，这是由于帝国主义者企图重新控制伊拉克以及一些阿拉伯沙文主义者企图把伊拉克并入阿拉伯联合共和国。报纸说，伊拉克的事应该由伊拉克自己来解决，任何国家都不应该进行煽动，因为这是违反联合国宪章和各民族的意志的。
    巴“领袖报”对纳赛尔的威胁感到遗憾
    新华社卡拉奇18日电　卡拉奇晚报“领袖报”今天的社论说，“一切头脑清醒的人对于纳赛尔总统要对伊拉克共和国组织一系列没有意义的流血行动的可怕威胁感到遗憾”。
    “领袖报”在评论纳赛尔最近在大马士革的演说时说，在摩苏尔的叛乱中，纳赛尔的活动变得更加明显了。这家报纸继续说，“如果任何人有过怀疑”，那么在他在大马士革“发表激烈的演说以后这种怀疑应该消失了”。
