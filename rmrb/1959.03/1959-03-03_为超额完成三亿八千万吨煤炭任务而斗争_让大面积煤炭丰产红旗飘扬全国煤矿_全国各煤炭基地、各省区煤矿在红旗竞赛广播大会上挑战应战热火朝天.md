Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: The nationwide coal mine workers have launched the red banner competition to fulfill the 380 million tons of coal task. This afternoon, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Central People's Broadcasting Station jointly held the "National Coal Miners Red Banner Competition" broadcast conference. Leaders of the coal mine administrations and bureaus of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions who attended the recent National Coal Industry Cadre Conference in Beijing, along with directors and mine managers from the Ministry of Coal Industry's mining bureaus, presented their red banner competition conditions, measures, and resolutions at the conference. Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo, addressed the national coal mine workers. Minister of Coal Industry, Zhang Linzhi, presided over the conference. Over one million coal mine workers across the country listened to the broadcast conference.

After pointing out the great achievements of China's coal industry in 1958 and the importance of completing this year's 380 million tons target, Bo Yibo emphasized the issues of grasping plans by the ten-day period and by the day, rapidly increasing the national daily coal production level, especially the daily production level of coking coal, vigorously carrying out mass movements centered on technological revolution, and conscientiously implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." In his speech, Bo Yibo called on all coal mine workers across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, to continue to exert soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, work practically, diligently, and cleverly, launch the red banner competition vigorously in large-scale mass movements centered on technological revolution, and let the red banner of large-area bumper harvests be planted all over the coal mines in the country.

At the broadcast conference, the Fushun Mining Bureau issued a red banner competition challenge to the Kailuan, Fuxin, Datong, Jixi, Hegang, Huainan, Jiaozuo coal bases and coal mines across the country. Qian Chuhang, Director of the Henan Provincial Coal Industry Bureau, on behalf of the coal mine workers of the province, issued a competition challenge to coal mine workers in all provinces and regions of the country. Yongchuan Coal Mine in Sichuan Province, which achieved high yields per unit area in thin coal seams, issued a competition challenge to coal mines with thin coal seams across the country. The coal washing plant of the Beipiao Mining Bureau issued a competition challenge to coal washing plants across the country. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau issued a competition challenge to units across the country tasked with building simple coal washing plants for a rapid construction competition.

The competition conditions put forward by the Fushun Mining Bureau are to guarantee the completion of the annual production task of 21 million tons of raw coal and 26 million tons of oil shale. The working faces of vertical and inclined shafts in the entire mining bureau will strive to reach an average monthly output of 15,000 tons, and vigorously strengthen tunneling work to ensure that the coal reserves (prepared minable coal reserves) of the entire bureau reach more than six months before National Day, and meet the various quality indicators stipulated by the state. At the same time, in the mass movement centered on technological revolution, fully exploit the potential of existing large-scale machinery and equipment, and carry out small-scale mechanization and automation movements. With the double leap forward in coal mine production and basic construction, the ground transportation volume of the Fushun Mining Bureau this year will increase by 64% compared with last year, the mining equipment manufactured by the machinery manufacturing plant will double compared with last year, the electrical equipment manufactured by the electrical machinery manufacturing plant will increase sixfold compared with last year, and the production of gunpowder, carbon black, and safety instruments will also increase from double to sixfold. Henan Province coal mine workers proposed to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the province's coal production tasks and increase the yield per unit area, under the premise of rational resource development, good preparation work, guaranteeing quality, and eliminating major accidents. From March to the end of the year, the province will ensure an average of 12,000 tons per working face, and strive to reach 15,000 tons. Specific targets were also put forward for product quality and labor productivity. Yongchuan Coal Mine in Sichuan, which proposed a competition to thin coal seam mines across the country, has coal seams that are 9 centimeters at the thickest and 4 centimeters at the thinnest. The target for large-area bumper harvests proposed by this mine is an average of 6,000 to 8,000 tons per working face. The coal washing plant of the Beipiao Mining Bureau proposed three major indicators for the competition to coal washing plants across the country: 1. The processing volume of raw coal will increase by 103% compared with last year, and the output of clean coal will increase by 81.6%; 2. Ensure the completion of the output targets required by the state; 3. The coal washing recovery rate will increase by another 5% compared with the original plan. In the initiative to accelerate the construction of simple coal washing plants to coal mines across the country, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau said that seven simple coal washing plants with a total production capacity of 2.1 million tons should be built as quickly as possible. The 30-2 type coal washing plant is guaranteed to be completed by March 10th; the 30-1 type coal washing plant is guaranteed to be completed by April 10th, but they will strive to complete it by the end of March. While speeding up the construction, it is also necessary to ensure the quality of the project, ensure safe construction, and save raw materials.

Sun Ran, Director of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration, on behalf of the seven mining bureaus (or administrations) of Kailuan, Fuxin, Datong, Jixi, Hegang, Huainan, and Jiaozuo, enthusiastically accepted the challenge from the Fushun Mining Bureau. These seven mining bureaus (administrations) all put forward their respective leap forward targets, and guaranteed that from March onwards, they would complete the plan every month and overfulfill the plan every quarter, guarantee the ash content target of raw coal, and strive to reduce it by another 3% to 5% compared with the national plan; improve labor efficiency and reduce costs. The overall efficiency of each bureau (administration) will increase by 14% to 26% compared with last year, and the cost of raw coal will be reduced by 10% to 24% respectively. Strictly implement technical policies, and each bureau (administration) guarantees that the coal reserves will reach more than six months in the first and second quarters. And specific measures were put forward. The Northeast, North China, and East China provinces, which are shouldering huge coal production tasks this year, have expressed their willingness to respond to Henan Province's initiative in the form of collaboration zones. The provinces in Northeast China, in combination with their own provincial conditions, have put forward competition conditions and practical measures. The main measures in the three northeastern provinces are to make great efforts in technological revolution and promote multi-cycle operations to increase the yield per unit area. At the same time, a five-ization movement is also being carried out. The five-izations are: mechanization, vigorously exploiting mechanical efficiency, and carrying out small-scale mechanization and multi-purpose machine use; acceleration, that is, quick cutting, quick releasing, quick mining, quick moving, quick tunneling, quick stripping, quick loading, quick transportation, quick unloading, and quick draining; multi-facing, that is, multi-cycle adoption of four-shift cross-integrated parallel operation, and training workers in multiple skills; diversification of solutions to material supply problems, that is, diligent repair, more manufacturing, more saving, more substitution, more utilization of waste products, close cooperation, and multi-purpose use of one item, etc.; safe production and construction. And resolutely implement the industrial management methods of "one handover, four bigs, two participations, one reform, and three combinations." Representatives of the four provinces and regions of Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong said in a joint speech that they would guarantee the completion of the preparation work for the construction of 26 new simple coal washing plants in these areas by the end of March, and guarantee that all equipment would be installed and put into production within one month after being transported to the site. Representatives of the eleven new coking coal bases, including Pingdingshan, Fengfeng, Xiaoyi, Luan, and Zaozhuang, jointly told the conference that they would guarantee the completion of the construction tasks of 47 pairs of coking coal shafts on schedule, and the completion of the construction of 43 simple coal washing plants in the first half of the year. Representatives of coal mines in the Northwest region and other regions also spoke.

The grand occasion of challenges and acceptances in the central venue was transmitted from the broadcast to coal mines across the country. From Hegang in Heilongjiang to Tengchong in Yunnan, from Xinjiang to Shandong, coal mine workers sent urgent telegrams and long-distance calls to the conference, promising to resolutely support Vice Premier Bo Yibo's speech, respond to and support the competition conditions put forward at the conference, immediately launch the red banner competition, and strive to ensure the completion of the 380 million tons of coal production task. After listening to the broadcast of the conference, more than 20,000 workers and staff of the Benxi Mining Bureau resolutely guaranteed that on the basis of overfulfilling the February plan, they would complete the first quarter plan ahead of schedule and achieve an all-round success for the entire bureau. They guaranteed that more than 10,000 meters would be tunneled in March, more than 3,000 meters more than in February, and that 60% of the coal mining faces would reach the red banner standards stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry. More than 20,000 workers and staff of the Pingdingshan Coal Mine in Henan, which specializes in producing coking coal for the iron and steel industry, put forward new leap forward plans while listening to the broadcast. Liu Jinchic, a national model worker in the coal industry, on behalf of the Second Well Construction Engineering Team of the Sixth Mine, guaranteed that two pairs of inclined shafts would be completed three months ahead of schedule. The Pingdingshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Pingdingshan Mining Bureau made a decision this afternoon: starting tomorrow, a high-yield and high-quality red banner competition will be launched in the entire mine to rapidly increase the daily production level. More than 70,000 miners and more than 40,000 family members of workers and staff in the Hegang Mining Bureau listened to the conference broadcast in 63 venues, and were greatly encouraged. The workers and staff of the Xing'an Mine vertical shaft unanimously expressed that they would strive to increase the production capacity by one time compared with the design capacity without increasing equipment.

A large number of competition conditions and guarantee letters all indicated that the vast number of coal mine industrial workers are determined to plant the red banner of large-area bumper harvests all over the coal mines in the country.

In his concluding speech at the conference, Minister of Coal Industry Zhang Linzhi pointed out: Everyone enthusiastically challenged, accepted challenges, and launched high-yield and high-quality red banner competitions at the conference. This soaring enthusiasm and determination to resolutely overfulfill production and construction tasks are important guarantees for realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the coal industry this year. He demanded that coal mine workers across the country learn from each other, improve together, and leap forward together in the red banner competition, and earnestly achieve guaranteed quantity, guaranteed quality, guaranteed safe production, and guaranteed the proportion of mining and tunneling, and achieve "high yields on all sides, high yields every month," and complete and overfulfill the glorious task of producing 380 million tons of coal this year in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
