Cadres as Workers, Masses Add Enthusiasm
Forty-Eight Factory Directors and Party Committee Secretaries in Tianjin Go to Workshops to Labor
A Batch of Department and Bureau Leaders in Qinghai Go Down to Industrial and Mining Enterprises for Training
    This newspaper Tianjin, March 3rd dispatch: Since the beginning of this year, forty-eight leading cadres, including factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and trade union chairmen from twenty-four factories in Tianjin, have been going down to workshops and teams to work as laborers for periods of one to two months, achieving good results.
    Last year, factories and enterprises in Tianjin systematically organized cadres to go down to workshops and teams to participate in physical labor and universally implemented a system of “following-shift labor” for leading cadres. This year, the Party organizations of these factories have decided that while continuing to adhere to the system of leading cadres participating in labor on a regular basis and the “following-shift labor” system, they will follow the example of “generals becoming soldiers” by having leading cadres leave their current positions and go to the grassroots level for short periods to work as laborers, completely eating, living, and working with the workers. At the same time, they will listen to and discover workers' opinions and demands regarding Party and government leadership at any time, and assist workshops or teams in studying and resolving problems existing in production and work.
    After these leading cadres went down to work as laborers, they set an example by strictly observing labor discipline, obeying team leadership, humbly learning from veteran workers, and taking the lead in working hard, regardless of dirt or fatigue. They were enthusiastically welcomed by the workers, and greatly boosted the workers' enthusiasm for production. Li Zhangshuan, deputy secretary of the Party committee of the Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, began working as a laborer in the scouring team of the printing and dyeing workshop on January 30. He studied diligently and worked actively, which boosted the workers' enthusiasm. Many people said: "The Party committee secretary is here to work as a laborer, full of energy, and we can't fall behind." As a result, the phenomenon of producing second-class and substandard products in this team in the past was reversed. Wang Wenhua, vice chairman of the trade union of the Internal Combustion Engine Factory, went to the third workshop to work as an apprentice and took veteran worker Qin Guoan as his teacher. In his work, he took the initiative to wipe machines, clean up, and sometimes even fetch water and pour tea for his master. He also frequently publicized the importance of producing irrigation and drainage equipment to support the great agricultural harvest, further boosting Qin Guoan's enthusiasm. When the workers of the Feilong Rubber Factory saw that the factory director, Qin Shuzhong, who was over fifty years old, went to the canteen to work as a cook and took the initiative to light stoves and clean up for the workers, they were very moved. People who used to think that cooks were inferior and were not at ease in their work now felt the glory of this work.
    Because leading cadres completely identified with their ordinary worker status, laboring and living alongside the workers, the relationship between cadres and workers was further strengthened, allowing leading cadres to truly take root among the masses. After Li Yuhua, deputy secretary of the Party committee of the Water Turbine Factory, went to the workshop to work as a laborer, some workers initially thought he was there to inspect the work and kept a distance from him. Later, they saw that he had no airs and worked very conscientiously, and their relationship with him became very close. The workers were always afraid that he would be tired and scrambled to do the heavy work, often asking him if he was cold or warm. The workers regarded him as a confidant and talked to him about everything. After the deputy secretary of the Party committee of the Guangkai Paper Mill went to the workshop, he found that the pulping workers were squatting on the cement pool to operate, and their cotton trousers were always half wet. He immediately suggested that the administrative leaders make oilcloth aprons, which the workers were very satisfied with.
    Leading cadres going down to work as laborers for short periods can conduct in-depth investigations and research, better listen to the opinions and demands of the masses, and timely discover and solve key problems in production. Li Zhangshuan, deputy secretary of the Party committee of the No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, felt in the past that there were some problems in the grassroots Party groups and that they could not fully play their due role, but he could not figure out the exact reasons, so he could not propose specific methods for improvement. This time, after working as a laborer, he found that the production teams in the workshop were divided too finely and the Party members were also dispersed. Some places could not form a leading core, so he suggested that the administrative department appropriately merge the production teams and establish a Party leadership core, which would be conducive to both production and political and ideological work among the masses. Some Party and government leading cadres in other factories also discovered some unrealistic situations in the work arrangements made by the leaders from the perspective of the workers after going down, and promptly suggested that the Party committee make improvements.
    Leading cadres have also made great achievements in familiarizing themselves with production knowledge and learning technology while working as laborers. Du Zhenhong, the director of the No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, was a transferred military officer and was not familiar with production. After going down to the roving frame maintenance team this time, the workers taught him the names and functions of each part of the roving frame and drawing frame, as well as how to disassemble, wash, and install them, without reservation. Now he can independently wipe the machine and fully understand the work content of the maintenance team.

    This newspaper Xining, March 3rd dispatch: The first batch of department and bureau leaders in Qinghai Province to go down to industrial and mining enterprises to work as laborers this year are conducting in-depth research on the problems existing in actual work during the process of labor training and are helping to solve them in a timely manner, which is of great significance for completing the plan for a greater leap forward this year.
    Most of the industrial and mining enterprises in Qinghai Province were established and developed during the Great Leap Forward last year. The management level of these factories and mines is still not keeping up with the requirements of production development. To achieve a greater leap forward this year, some problems must be solved in a timely manner. Therefore, this year's leadership cadres going down to work as laborers also have such a task: to help these factories and mines improve their management level and fully tap their production potential to ensure the realization of this year's leap forward plan.
    After the leading cadres of each department and bureau went down to the factories and mines, they ate, lived, and worked with the workers, earnestly carrying out labor training while strengthening the investigation and research of practical work. After Li Xingwang, the minister of the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, went down to the Qinghai Provincial Automobile Repair Factory to work as a laborer, he found through working with the workers that this factory had great potential to be tapped in terms of labor allocation and equipment utilization. The sand casting workshop of this factory was originally divided into three teams. Several experienced master craftsmen were concentrated in one team, while the other teams had more apprentices. Relying solely on the team leader to guide production, the team leader could not manage it all, and the master craftsmen only cared about their work and had no time to help the apprentices. After discovering this problem, he helped the factory adjust the labor organization and divided it into eight combat teams with veteran workers as the backbone, adopting the method of simultaneously producing several products in a cross-cutting manner. As a result, production efficiency was greatly improved. In terms of equipment utilization, Li Xingwang found that of the thirty machine tools in the manufacturing workshop, some were operating three shifts, some were operating two shifts, some were operating only one shift, and some were operating less than one shift. If all were operating three shifts, the equipment utilization rate could be increased by 35% compared to the original; if the method of workers taking turns off on Sundays and equipment not resting were adopted, the equipment utilization rate could be increased by 58.9% compared to the original. Based on the conditions of this factory, Li Xingwang suggested opening three shifts, which greatly improved the utilization rate of the equipment. In terms of mobilizing the masses and vigorously carrying out technological revolution, Li Xingwang found that this factory also had great potential to be tapped. For example, there were thirty-one manual operations in the repair workshop that could be converted into machine operations. He suggested that this workshop or several workshops work together to solve these machine problems.
    Hu Xiqing, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Labor Reform Bureau, together with the workers in the process of going down to the Xinsheng Iron Smelting Plant as a laborer, researched and developed a set of experiences to turn white pig iron into grey pig iron. Qiang Jianhua, director of the Qinghai Provincial Fuel Bureau, found some problems in the workers' lives in the Donggou Coal Mine. After helping to solve them in a timely manner, the workers were more motivated, and the production of raw coal increased from 290 tons per day to more than 500 tons, and the daily output of coke increased by nearly one time.
    Currently, this batch of leading cadres has returned to their agencies one after another. They are preparing to go to factories and mines again in the second half of the year to work as laborers, so as to train themselves, improve their leadership level, and improve their leadership style.

    干部当工人　群众添干劲
    天津四十八名厂长党委书记等到车间劳动
    青海一批厅、局长下放工矿企业进行锻炼
    本报天津3日电　天津市二十四个工厂的四十八名厂长、党委书记和工会主席等领导干部，今年以来以一到两个月的时间下放到车间、小组当工人，收到良好的效果。
    天津市的工厂、企业去年有计划地组织干部下车间、小组参加体力劳动，并且普遍实行了领导干部“跟班劳动”的制度。今年这些工厂的党组织确定在继续坚持领导干部定期参加劳动和“跟班劳动”制度的同时，仿照“将军当兵”的办法，使领导干部脱离现任职务，短期到基层去当工人，完全与工人同吃、同住、同劳动；同时，随时听取和发现工人对党政领导的意见和要求，协助车间或小组研究解决生产和工作中存在的问题。
    这些领导干部下去当工人以后，都以身作则地严格遵守劳动纪律，服从小组领导，虚心向老工人学习，不怕脏不怕累带头苦干，受到了职工的热情欢迎，并且大大鼓舞了职工的生产积极性。天津第六棉纺织厂党委副书记李章拴1月30日开始到印染车间精炼小组当工人后，虚心学习，积极肯干，鼓舞了工人的干劲，很多人表示：党委书记来当工人，干劲十足，我们也不能落后。结果扭转了这个小组过去出二等品、等外品的现象。内燃机厂工会副主席王文华到第三车间当徒工，拜老工人秦国安为师，在工作中他主动擦机器，打扫卫生，有时还给师傅提水倒茶，并经常向工人宣传生产排灌设备对支援农业大丰收的重要作用，进一步鼓舞了秦国安的干劲。飞龙橡胶厂的职工看到五十多岁的厂长秦守忠到食堂当炊事员，主动为工人生火炉，搞卫生，十分感动，过去一向认为炊事员低人一等而不安心工作的人，现在也感到这一工作的光荣。
    由于领导干部完全以普通工人身份与工人同劳动、同生活，进一步密切了干部与工人的关系，使得领导干部真正在群众中扎了根。水轮机厂党委副书记李雨化到车间当工人后，开始时有些工人以为他是来检查工作，和他比较疏远，后来看到他没有一点架子，干活也很认真，和他的关系很亲密。工人们总怕他累着了，都抢着干重活，经常问寒问暖。工人们把他当成知心人，什么话都对他谈。广开造纸厂党委副书记下车间后，发现打浆工人蹲在洋灰池上操作，每天棉裤都要湿半截，马上就建议行政领导制作油布围裙，工人感到很满意。
    领导干部短期下放当工人，可以深入进行调查研究，更好地听取群众的意见和要求，及时发现和解决生产中的关键。棉纺六厂党委副书记李章拴过去感到基层党小组存在一些问题，不能充分发挥应有的作用，但到底原因何在摸不清楚，因此对如何改进，提不出具体办法。这次当工人后，发现车间生产小组划分太细，党员也分散，有的地方不能形成领导核心，就建议行政把生产小组适当合并，建立了党的领导核心，既有利于生产，又便于对群众进行政治思想工作。还有些工厂党政领导干部下去以后，从工人角度发现了一些领导上布置工作不切实际的情况，就及时建议党委加以改进。
    领导干部当工人在熟悉生产知识、学习技术等方面也获得很大的成绩。第六棉纺织厂厂长杜振洪是部队转业的，对生产不熟悉，这次下到并粗保全组后，工人们手把着手地把粗纱机、并条机的各个部件的名称、性能以及如何拆洗、安装等都毫无保留的教给了他。现在他已经能独立擦车了，并全部了解了保全组的工作内容。
    本报西宁3日电　青海省今年首批下放到工矿企业当工人的厅、局长领导干部，在劳动锻炼的过程中，深入研究实际工作中存在的问题，并及时帮助解决，对完成今年更大跃进的计划有很大意义。
    青海省的工矿企业，大部分是在去年大跃进中建立和发展起来的。这些厂矿企业的管理水平，还跟不上生产发展的要求。今年要实现更大的跃进，有些问题必须及时解决。因此，今年领导干部下放当工人，同时也就有这样一个任务：帮助这些厂矿企业提高管理水平，并充分挖掘生产潜力，以保证实现今年的跃进计划。
    各厅、局领导干部下放到厂矿企业以后，都和工人同吃同住同劳动，一面认真进行劳动锻炼，一面加强对实际工作的调查研究。中共青海省委工业交通部部长李兴旺下放到青海省汽车修理厂当工人后，通过和工人一起劳动，发现这个厂在劳动力的配备、设备的利用等方面，都大有潜力可挖。这个厂翻砂车间原来划分三个小组，几个有经验的老师傅集中在一个组里，其他组的学徒多，光靠组长指导生产，组长管不过来，而老师傅们都只顾干活，没时间帮助学徒。他发现这个问题以后，帮助工厂调整了劳动组织，以老工人为骨干，分成八个战斗小组，采取几种产品同时交叉生产的办法，结果生产效率大大提高。在设备利用方面，李兴旺发现制造车间三十台机床，现在有的开三班，有的开两班，有的只开一班，有的还不到一班。如果都开三班，设备的利用率可比原来提高35％；如采取工人星期天轮休、设备不休息的办法，设备利用率可较原来提高58.9％。李兴旺根据这个厂具备的条件，建议开三班，结果大大提高了设备的利用率。在发动群众、大闹技术革命方面，李兴旺发现这个厂也大有潜力可挖。如修理车间有三十一个手工操作，是有条件改为机具操作的。他建议由这个车间或几个车间共同协作来解决这些机具问题。
    青海省劳改局副局长胡席卿在下放到新生炼铁厂当工人的过程中，和工人一起研究出了一套使白口铁变灰口铁的经验。青海省燃料局局长强建华在东沟煤矿发现工人生活上存在着一些问题，及时帮助解决以后，工人们的干劲更足了，原煤生产由原来日产二百九十吨增加到五百多吨，焦炭日产量增加近一倍。
    目前，这批领导干部已相继回机关，他们准备下半年再到厂矿去当一次工人，以锻炼自己，提高领导水平，改进领导作风。
