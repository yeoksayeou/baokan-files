    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 6th: Prime Minister Nehru today expressed his dissatisfaction with the United States' explanation to India regarding the bilateral military agreement it signed with Pakistan.

    Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference here this morning that the US Ambassador to India visited Indian Foreign Ministry officials last night and explained that the bilateral military agreement between the United States and Pakistan was subject to the Eisenhower Doctrine, which is limited to defending against aggression from so-called "communist countries." It was also said that "this treaty has nothing new or additional." Nehru said that he was "not satisfied with this explanation because no matter what understanding is reached, things may develop in such a way that the problem may become confused and difficult to distinguish, causing entanglement." He cited an example: Pakistan "used American weapons" when invading the border.

    He also said that from the perspective of the US government, this explanation is true.

    He said that the Indian government has brought to the attention of the US government the statements interpreting this agreement published in Pakistan.

    According to the interpretation of the statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman, this agreement applies to resisting "aggression from any source."

    He said that the bilateral military treaties concluded with Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey are "something that replaces the Baghdad Pact."

    美国粉饰美巴军事协定
    印度总理尼赫鲁表示不满
    新华社新德里6日电　尼赫鲁总理今天对美国就它同巴基斯坦签订的双边军事协定向印度进行的解释表示不满。
    尼赫鲁总理今天上午在这里举行的记者招待会上说，美国驻印度大使昨晚访问了印度外交部官员，并且解释说，美国同巴基斯坦签订的双边军事协定是受艾森豪威尔主义约制的，而艾森豪威尔主义只限于防御来自所谓“共产主义国家方面的侵略”。又说“这个条约没有什么新的东西，或者外加的东西。”尼赫鲁说，他“对这种解释并不满意，因为不管取得怎样的谅解，事情可能这样发展起来以致问题可能混淆而很难区别，使人纠缠不清”。他援引了这样一个例子：在侵犯边境时，巴基斯坦“使用了美国的武器”。
    他还说，从美国政府的角度来看，这种解释是真实的。
    他说，印度政府已经提请美国政府注意在巴基斯坦发表的解释这个协定的声明。
    按照巴基斯坦外交部发言人发表的声明的解释，这项协定适用于抵制“来自任何方面的侵略”。
    他说，同巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其缔结的双边军事条约是“某种代替巴格达条约的东西”。
