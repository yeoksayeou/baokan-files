Skilled Craftsman – Tuo Hu Ti Ke Ran Mu
By our reporters Wang An Yang Kexian

Tuo Hu Ti Ke Ran Mu is the oldest of the one thousand plus representatives attending the Xinjiang Agricultural Advanced Production Units and Advanced Producers Representative Conference. He is eighty-two years old, his eyebrows are gray, but he is very energetic.

When we asked the old man about his health, Tuo Hu Ti Ke Ran Mu jokingly replied: "It has been more than nine years since liberation, and I haven't used my public medical card once since I received it!"

Tuo Hu Ti Ke Ran Mu is an ordinary agricultural machinery repairman in Xinjiang. In the past nine years, he has traveled all over Turpan and Kuqa, and all over the counties of the vast Korla region, finally settling down in Qiemo County. He is not afraid of any hardship, traveling thousands of miles to repair animal-drawn farm implements, water mills, and various crop processing tools for farmers of various ethnic groups. The farmers affectionately call him "Tuo Hu Ti Aka (Brother)."

Tuo Hu Ti spent seventy-two years of his life in poverty, hunger, insult, and beatings. From the age of nine, he successively learned ironwork, house building, flour milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning water turbines, and making iron and wood looms... But none of it was useful. In order to survive, he had to wander around.

One year, Tuo Hu Ti and his brother Mai Fa Ni Ya Zi made a water-powered cotton gin. They moved the machine from Turpan to Kuqa County. At first, four big landlords in Kuqa were competing to gin cotton. Later, the landlords agreed that no one would gin and ordered Tuo Hu Ti to move the machine out of Kuqa County. When Tuo Hu Ti refused to move, they sent Tuo Hu Ti to the county government and imprisoned him for six months. After being released from prison, Tuo Hu Ti moved the machine to the remote Qi Nai Ba Ke village. After the landlords found out, they instigated their henchmen to destroy the machine. Tuo Hu Ti had no choice but to pack up his bedding and wander again.

Later, Tuo Hu Ti found a job in the farm implement factory affiliated to the Agricultural Reclamation Department in the old society. He worked for more than ten years. With his rich experience and skillful hands, he made thousands of farm implement parts and repaired all kinds of farm implements. In the end, he was sent to Fukang for land reclamation. More than four thousand peasant brothers who were forced to participate in this land reclamation worked under the whip. Tuo Hu Ti fell ill. After recovering, the factory director said to him:

"You are over sixty years old and useless." He was driven out like that. He had to pick up scraps in the garbage dump to fill his stomach. He had a pair of hardworking and skillful hands, but he had always lived a wandering life lacking food and clothing. More than once he thought: Is the world so big that there is no place for Tuo Hu Ti to use his hands? Can the poor never find a happy life?

In his seventy-second year, Xinjiang was liberated, and Tuo Hu Ti returned to Urumqi from Hotan. With a longing heart, he came to the farm implement station (the original farm implement factory) to test whether he could act as a watchman. After the leaders of the farm implement station learned that he was an old worker who had worked here for more than ten years, they kept him as an ordinary handyman.

Not long after Tuo Hu Ti arrived at the farm implement station, he saw three scrapped horse-drawn harvesters left over from the Kuomintang era and couldn't help but want to repair them. One day, he said to Stationmaster A He Mai Ti: "I think these machines can be repaired." He started to repair and install them. His technique was so skilled that even the cadres of the farm implement station were mesmerized. The stationmaster immediately praised him over the loudspeaker and promoted him from handyman to agricultural machinery repairman. These facts made Tuo Hu Ti feel that the world had changed greatly.

In the early days of liberation, Xinjiang was very short of agricultural machinery repair talents. Tuo Hu Ti traveled from county to county to help farmers repair and match new farm implements. From then on, he felt that his hands were useful. His good reputation spread wider and wider. In the summer of 1956, Tuo Hu Ti was repairing farm implements in the countryside of Ruoqiang County when someone from Qiemo County, separated by the vast desert, sent someone to invite him to build a water-powered cotton gin that they had never seen before. At that time, the highway between Ruoqiang and Qiemo had not yet been built. Tuo Hu Ti was already seventy-nine years old. He rode a donkey and set off with a transportation team.

The section from Ruoqiang to Qiemo is a well-known quicksand area in Xinjiang. The eyes are full of yellow sand rolling and flowing with the wind. Along the way, he drank bitter and salty water, and at night he wrapped himself in a fur coat and slept on the sand dunes. After many days of hard travel, Tuo Hu Ti arrived in Qiemo County.

With the support of the local leaders, Tuo Hu Ti helped farmers establish three large-scale water-powered cotton ginning plants in one year. The water turbine cotton gin he made can gin 8,000 jin of cotton per day, which is more than 100 times more efficient than a manual cotton gin.

Over the years, Tuo Hu Ti had a wish buried deep in his heart: to be a conscious and cultured Communist Party member. He had repeatedly submitted applications to the Party organizations of the units he had worked for. In order to learn the Party's policies and rapidly improve his political awareness, Tuo Hu Ti began to learn culture at the age of seventy-six. After eight months, he finally learned to write and spell the Uyghur alphabet. Once he mastered the culture, he first bought a Uyghur version of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China and carried it with him. He studied and understood it word by word. He knew how important every word was.

In October 1957, Tuo Hu Ti's long-cherished wish was realized. The local Party organization in Qiemo County accepted him into the Communist Party of China. At this time, he had just turned eighty years old.

Last spring, the call to arms of the agricultural Great Leap Forward sounded, and remote Qiemo County felt that various farm implements, animal power, and manpower were very tight. Before the summer harvest, the farm implement reform movement started. Tuo Hu Ti thought that he was a Communist Party member and should serve the people better. Seeing that the farmers in Qiemo County used large sickles to cut wheat, which was too slow, he created a human-pushed or horse-drawn harvester. He felt that the efficiency of the cotton gin was still low, and the cotton dust in the machine room was flying around, which hindered the health of the workers, so he thought of improving the water turbine cotton gin. Seeing that the wheat was about to be harvested, Qiemo, a grain-producing county, did not have many stone rollers for threshing, and there was an urgent need to create a new threshing machine. From then on, Tuo Hu Ti began to think about and design the thresher day and night. He would pick up a pencil and draw on paper, and then take out a chalk and draw on the wall. When he felt bored at night, he would lie down with his clothes on; when he felt there was a glimmer of hope, he would immediately jump up and draw again. When he felt bored during the day, he would go to the street to breathe. When walking on the street, his hands would involuntarily draw in the air. He was thinking about the model diagram, and he simply didn't see the pedestrians on the road. When he was fighting against difficulties, Comrade Hao Shu Chuan, deputy secretary of the Qiemo County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, often came to encourage him and persuade him not to be discouraged. In this way, Tuo Hu Ti finally designed the model diagram in seven days, and after twenty-five days of manufacturing and modification, a seven-horsepower water-powered wheat thresher named "Dongfeng" was manufactured. After testing, it only took four people to operate, and it could thresh 850 jin of wheat per hour, which was equivalent to the efficiency of more than 100 cattle trampling the field, and the threshed wheat was also clean. The masses happily said: "Tuo Hu Ti Aka is truly the technical revolutionist of our Qiemo County!"

After the Dongfeng wheat thresher was successfully manufactured, the Korla region asked him to teach the iron and wood craftsmen of the five counties in the entire region the technology of manufacturing the wheat thresher. There, he further studied and modified it into a universal thresher for various grain crops. When he set off to Urumqi for the meeting, the young Uyghur iron and wood craftsmen excitedly sent off their master.

    能工巧匠——托乎提·克然木
    本报记者　王安　杨克现
    托乎提·克然木，是出席新疆农业先进生产单位及先进生产者代表会议一千多个代表中年纪最老的一个。他，八十二岁，眉毛都灰白了，精神却很旺盛。
    我们问候老人身体健康的时候，托乎提·克然木却诙谐地回答说：“解放九年多了，自从领到公费医疗证，还没有用过它一次呢！”
    托乎提·克然木是新疆一个普通的农机修理员。最近九年来，他走遍了吐鲁番、库车，走遍了辽阔的库尔勒专区各县，最后在且末县安家立业。他不畏任何艰苦，千里奔波，为各地维吾尔族农民修理马拉农具，修理水磨，修建各种农作物加工工具。农民们都亲切地叫他“托乎提阿卡（哥）。”
    托乎提有七十二年的生活都是在贫困、饥饿、侮辱和鞭打中度过的。他从九岁开始，便陆续学会了打铁、盖房、做磨面、榨油、轧棉花的水轮机，学会做铁木质的织布机……，但都没有用处，他为了生活，还不得不到处流浪。
    有一年，托乎提和他的哥哥买法尼亚孜制成了一架水力轧花机。他们把机器从吐鲁番搬到库车县，开始时库车四个大地主都争着轧棉花，后来地主们商定谁都不轧，命令托乎提把机器搬出库车县，托乎提不搬，他们就把托乎提扭送县衙，坐了六个月监狱。从监狱出来，托乎提把机器搬到偏僻的其乃巴克村。地主们发觉后，唆使爪牙捣毁机器。托乎提无法，只好背起铺盖流浪了。
    后来，托乎提在旧社会的农垦厅附属农具厂找到工作，干了十多年，他凭着丰富的经验和灵巧的双手打制过成千的农具配件，修理过各式各样的农具。最后，却派他去阜康开荒。这一次被迫参加垦荒的四千多个农民兄弟都是在皮鞭下工作的，托乎提病倒了。病好后，厂长对他说：
  “你已六十多岁，没有用处了。”就这样把他赶了出来。他不得不在垃圾堆里捡些破烂混肚子，空有一双勤劳而又灵巧的手，却一直过着缺吃缺穿的流浪生活。他不止一次想到：难道世界这样大，竟没有托乎提施展双手的地方，难道穷人就永远找不到幸福的生活？
    七十二岁那年，新疆解放了，托乎提从和阗回到了乌鲁木齐。他怀着眷恋的心情来到农具站（即原先农具厂），试探能不能充当一名打更巡夜的人。农具站领导上知道他是曾在这里作过十几年工的老工人以后，留下他做一个普通杂工。
    托乎提到了农具站不久，看见国民党时代遗留下来的三架报废的马拉割麦机，禁不住就想动手修理。有一天，他给阿合买提站长说：“我看这些机器是可以修理好的。”说着就动手修理安装。他的技术是那样熟练，连农具站干部也看得出神。站长马上用广播喇叭表扬了他，把他从杂工提升为农机修理员。这些事实，使托乎提觉得世界大大变了样子。
    解放初期，新疆各地农机修理人才非常缺少，托乎提走了一县又一县，帮助农民修配新式农具。从此，他才觉得他的一双手有了用处。他的好名声也因而越传越广。1956年夏天，托乎提正在婼羌县农村修理农具，隔着大沙漠的且末县派人来请他去造那里还没有见过的水轮轧花机。当时婼羌到且末之间的公路还没有修通，托乎提已经七十九岁了，他骑着一头毛驴，随着一帮运输队出发了。
    从婼羌到且末是新疆境内一段有名的流沙地带，满眼尽是黄沙滚滚随风流动的沙丘。沿途喝着又苦又咸的水，夜晚就地裹着皮大衣睡在沙堆上。经过了多少天的旅途辛苦，托乎提才到了且末县。
    托乎提在当地领导的支持下，一年间帮助农民建立起三座大型水力轧花厂。他制造的水轮轧花机，每台每天可以轧花八千斤，比人力轧花机工效提高一百多倍。
    几年以来，托乎提内心深处早就埋藏着一个愿望：作一个有觉悟、有文化的共产党员。他曾经多次地把申请书递给他工作过的单位的党组织。为了学习党的政策，迅速提高自己的政治觉悟，托乎提从七十六岁那年开始学文化。前后经过八个月，他终于学会了维吾尔族文字母的书写和拼音。一掌握了文化，他首先就买了一本维吾尔文中国共产党党章带在身边。他逐字逐句地研究、理解，他知道上面每一个字是多么重要。
    1957年10月，托乎提多年的愿望实现了，且末县当地党组织接收他参加了中国共产党。这时，他正刚刚满八十岁。
    去年春天，农业大跃进的号角响起来了，边远的且末县感到各种农具、畜力和人力都非常紧张，到夏收前，农具改革运动便闹起来了。托乎提想到自己是一个共产党员，应当更好地为人民服务。他看到且末县农民用大镰刀割麦，速度太慢，就创造一种人推的或者是马拉的割麦机；他觉得轧花机效率还低，而机器房棉絮尘土飞扬，又妨碍工人健康，便想法改进了水轮轧花机。眼看麦子就要收割，且末这个产粮县连个打场的石?也不多，急需创造一种新的打场机器。从这以后，托乎提就日夜思考、设计起打谷机起来了。他一会儿拿起铅笔在纸上画，一会儿掏出粉笔在墙上画。夜晚想得闷了，他合衣而卧；觉得有一线希望，立刻跳起再画。白天想得闷了，就上街道透透风。在街上散步时，手又情不自禁地在空里画起来了，他一心想着模型图，简直连路上的行人也视而不见。在他和困难作斗争的时候，中共且末县委副书记郝树川同志经常来鼓励他，劝他不要灰心丧气。这样托乎提终于在七天内把模型图设计出来，又加上二十五天的制造修改，一架被命名为“东风牌”七马力的水力小麦脱粒机制造出来了。经过试验，只要四个人操纵，每小时可脱小麦八百五十斤，顶上一百多头牛踩场的效率，打出的小麦也干净。群众都高兴地说：“托乎提阿卡真是我们且末县的技术革命家！”
    东风牌小麦脱粒机制造成功后，库尔勒专区请他向全专区五个县的铁木工匠传授制造小麦脱粒机的技术。在那里他又进一步研究把它改为各种粮食作物的万能脱粒机。当他动身到乌鲁木齐开会的时候，年轻的维吾尔铁木工匠们都无比兴奋地替老师傅送行。
