Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Washington dispatch, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower said at a press conference on March 25th that he could not draw conclusions about the situation in Tibet due to the brevity of the information. Eisenhower avoided answering questions about the possibility of outside aid to the Tibetan rebels.

The next day, March 26th, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Christian Herter issued a statement slandering the Chinese government for "violating the agreement," and attacked the Chinese army's suppression of the rebellion with vicious language, saying it was a "brutal suppression" of "a courageous people." Herter expressed "sadness" and was "deeply shocked" by the rapid clearing of rebels in the Lhasa area, and said that the United States "sees another inspiring example of the indomitable spirit of mankind" in the Tibetan rebellion.

According to United Press International, U.S. officials said it would be difficult for the United States to do anything to support the Tibetan rebellion, even if doing so would be "politically appropriate." These officials also said that the only practical way to supply weapons to the rebels would be by air, which would mean flying over Indian territory or mainland China.

    赫脱就我国西藏局势发表声明
    诬蔑和攻击我国讨伐叛乱
    竟对拉萨叛匪被肃清表示“难过”
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息，美国总统艾森豪威尔3月25日在记者招待会上说，由于消息过于简略，他无法对西藏局势下结论。艾森豪威尔避免回答关于外界援助西藏叛匪的可能性问题。
    第二天，3月26日，美国代理国务卿赫脱又发表声明，诬蔑中国政府“破坏了协定”，并且用恶毒的字句攻击中国军队讨伐叛乱，说什么这是对“一个勇敢的民族”的“残酷的镇压”。赫脱对叛匪在拉萨地区被迅速肃清表示“难过”和“深为震惊”，并且说什么美国从西藏叛乱中“看到人类不屈不挠的精神的又一个令人鼓舞的范例”。
    据合众国际社报道，美国的官员们说，美国很难做什么事情来支持西藏的叛乱，即使这样做“在政治上是相宜的”。这些官员们还说，把武器供给叛乱者的唯一切合实际的方式将是空运，这意味着飞过印度的领土或者中国本部。
