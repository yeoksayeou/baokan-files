    Officers and Privates
    In Britain, if a person's resume contains the words "public school," then it's as if they've been branded with a special mark. A British friend told me about this interesting experience he had:
    This friend graduated from a public school. During the anti-fascist war, he volunteered for the army, requesting to be a private. When the military authorities saw his resume: a public school graduate. "Ah! How can we let a public school graduate be a private!" So, without hesitation, they promoted him to officer. In less than two days, the police department's file arrived, saying he was a "dangerous" communist. He was immediately stripped of his officer's rank and demoted to a common soldier.
    The story doesn't end there. Later, the unit was transferred to Egypt. The British military authorities stationed in Egypt saw his resume and immediately had the same conditioned reflex: "Ah! How can we let a public school graduate be a private!" He was immediately promoted to officer again.
    The result, of course, was the same: Soon, a telegram arrived in Cairo from London, saying he was a "dangerous" communist. He was once again stripped of his officer's rank and demoted to a common soldier, where he remained until he left the army at the end of World War II.
    This true story shows how much magic power "public school" possesses.

              Pyramid

    The so-called "public schools" in Britain are actually a type of privileged class school established by the bourgeoisie to firmly grasp ruling power in their own hands and to pass this ruling power down through generations without fail. It is itself a type of secondary school, entered at age twelve and graduated from at age eighteen. Students who can enter these schools only account for 1.3% of young people of the same age. Before entering, they must graduate from a "preparatory school" - an aristocratic primary school. Once students from public schools graduate from university, the bourgeoisie immediately places them in important positions in industry, politics, and state institutions. Among senior figures in the British ruling class, 87% of generals, 83% of archbishops, 67% of senior civil servants, 82% of colonial governors, 85% of judges, 95% of senior officials in the Foreign Office, and 88% of ambassadors are graduates of public schools.
    In order to strengthen its rule, the bourgeoisie also established "grammar schools" to cultivate a segment of "middle-level personnel." The majority of students come from the petty bourgeoisie or are "selected" from among the children of some workers. Students attending these schools account for about 20% of young people of the same age, and only a small number of them can hope to attend university. The remaining 80% of young people can only attend "modern secondary schools" (equivalent to junior high school), and they have no hope of attending university at all.
    This pyramid shape of the British education system perfectly reflects the essence of British society: a very small number of ruling-class children attend public schools and are groomed to be future rulers; petty-bourgeois children and a very small portion of workers' children attend "grammar schools," where they are trained to be bourgeois clerks; the vast majority of workers' children can only attend "modern secondary schools" and become the future reserve army of labor.

                  Eton College

    The management of public schools is usually composed of important figures from the traditional ruling class, and the government and parliament have no right to interfere. The management committee of the famous Eton College in Britain includes people known as "prime minister makers" - Salisbury, the Governor of the Bank of England Cobbold, as well as several famous British nobles and directors of large companies; the management committee of Harrow School includes the Lord Chancellor, a Field Marshal, Conservative Party members of parliament, and directors of large companies; the management committee of Wellington College includes six generals, two air marshals, an admiral, and a director of a large company. Entering public schools requires paying huge tuition fees, reaching as much as 430 pounds per student per year, equivalent to the entire annual income of a worker. Those bourgeois gentlemen and ladies often register their children as soon as they are born, regardless of whether they are talented or idiotic, and then send them to public schools at the age of twelve.
    The teaching facilities and faculty in public schools are incomparably better than those in ordinary municipal schools. Most public schools are boarding schools. At Eton College, which we visited, each student has a dormitory. The number of teachers is twice as high as in ordinary schools, and the vast majority come from aristocratic universities such as Oxford and Cambridge.
    In these public schools, senior students have absolute power over junior students, just like commanders and soldiers in feudal times. Younger children also have to make beds for older children. Not only that, but older children can also physically punish younger children. I saw a bamboo whip in the rooms of senior students, which was specially used for spanking. The public school scene described by Dickens in "David Copperfield" has not changed at all to this day. All of this is said to cultivate "leadership qualities," in other words, to fully develop the nature of the exploiting class.
    The head teacher told us that they want to cultivate students to be "people with political responsibility, because Eton has a political tradition." Since Britain has had prime ministers, there have been more than forty in total, of which eighteen, including the first prime minister, Robert Walpole, and the current prime minister, Macmillan, all came from Eton College. Currently, one-eighth of the members of parliament, 32.4% of cabinet members, 30.9% of directors of large companies in the City of London, and 29.7% of directors of the five major banks are graduates of Eton College.

            People Who "Chop Wood and Carry Water"
    Britain's "modern secondary schools," on the other hand, are specifically for cultivating people who "chop wood and carry water" (Ministry of Education notice). These students generally can only study until the age of fifteen, and then they have to leave school to become apprentices in factories. Students in these schools are considered to be people who "don't use their brains" and "only use their hands." This is because they failed a certain exam at the age of ten. It is extremely absurd to judge a person's talent at the age of ten, but in practice, this kind of exam, or "selection," starts at the age of nine, eight, or even seven. The result of the "selection" is only to send a limited number of so-called "smart" children to "grammar schools," and individual ones are even sent to public schools (now one in 100,000 in London), while the vast majority are "not smart," are "not using their brains," and are sent to "modern secondary schools." The bourgeoisie always loves to talk about their cliches: "Socialism restricts people's individuality"; the opposite is true: in capitalist society, how many talented people are branded as "untalented" before they are even enlightened!
    The curriculum in "modern secondary schools" is limited and does not provide any systematic knowledge. There are basically three subjects: arithmetic, English, and history. For capitalists, these are necessary to be able to operate modern machines. Some courses have become tools to ideologically control the workers' movement. Many invaders and colonizers have become heroes in the classroom. Prayers are said before class every day, and there is one and a half hours of religious class every week. The facilities are also extremely poor, and classes are crowded. According to statistics in 1958, more than two-thirds of the classes exceeded the officially prescribed number of students. The lack of teachers is even more widespread, and their wages are also extremely low. Many teachers have to do other work during holidays and spare time in order to make a living.
    In Britain, money can buy education, buy power, buy everything you need. The so-called "individuality," "democracy," "freedom and equality" are just a screen for the stinking money relationship.

    教育与金钱

    军官和列兵
    在英国，如果一个人的履历表上填有“公学”二字，那末他就等于刻上了特别标记。有位英国朋友告诉我关于他这样一段有趣的经历：
    这位朋友毕业于公学，在反法西斯战争时，他自愿从军，要求当一名列兵。兵役当局一看他的履历：公学毕业。“啊！怎么能让公学毕业生当一名列兵！”于是他们毫不犹豫地把他提拔为军官。过不了两天，警察局的档案送到了，说他是个“危险的”共产党员。他一下子被剥夺了军官的职务，贬为一个普通战士。
    故事到这里还没有完结。后来部队调到了埃及。驻在埃及的英国军事当局看到了他的履历表，立刻引起了同样的条件反射：“啊！怎么能让公学的毕业生当一名列兵！”他马上又被提拔成军官。
    结果当然是同样的：不久，伦敦拍到开罗一个电报，说他是个“危险的”共产党员。他再一次被剥夺了军官的职务。被贬为一个普通的战士，直到第二次世界大战结束时离开部队为止。
    这一真实的故事，说明“公学”具有多大的魔力。
              金　字　塔
    英国的所谓“公学”，实际上是资产阶级为了把统治权牢牢地掌握在自己手中，并把这种统治权万无一失地祖祖辈辈传下去的一种特权阶级的学校。它本身是一种中等学校，十二岁进去，十八岁毕业。能够入这种学校的学生仅只占同年龄青年的1.3％。在入校以前，必须在一种“预备学校”——贵族小学毕业。从公学出来的学生，一旦在大学毕业之后，资产阶级立即把他们放到工业、政治和国家机构的重要岗位上。在英国统治阶级高级人物中，87％的将军、83％的大主教、67％的高级民政官员、82％的殖民总督、85％的法官、95％的外交部高级官员、88％的大使都毕业于公学。
    资产阶级为了加强它的统治，培养一部分“中层人员”，还设立了“语法学校”，学生大部分都是来自小资产阶级，或从一部分工人子女中“选拔”来的。上这种学校的学生，占同年龄青年的20％左右，其中只有少部分人可以希望上大学。其余80％的青年只能上“现代中学”（相当于初中），他们根本没有上大学的希望。
    英国教育制度的这种金字塔形，正好反映了英国社会的本质：极少数统治阶级的子女上公学，被造就成未来的统治者；小资产阶级和极少一部分工人子女上“语法学校”，把他们培养成资产阶级的职员；绝大部分工人子女则只能上“现代中学”，成为未来的产业后备军。
                  伊　登　公　学
    公学的管理机构照例是由传统的统治阶级中重要人物组成的，政府和议会无权过问。英国著名的伊登公学管理委员会中有英国人称之为“制造首相”的人——索耳兹伯里、英格兰银行行长柯伯尔德，此外还有几个英国著名的贵族和大公司董事；汉诺公学管理委员会中有大法官、元帅、保守党议员、大公司董事；威灵顿公学管理委员会中有六个将军、两个空军元帅、一个海军大将、一个大公司董事等。进入公学，得付出巨额学费，每年每个学生竟达四百三十镑之多，等于一个工人一年的全部收入。那些资产阶级先生女士们往往生下孩子，不问是蠢才或是白痴，就先去登记，待十二岁时，送入公学。
    公学中的教学设备和师资比一般市政学校要好得无法比拟。大多数公学都是寄宿的。我们参观过的伊登公学，每个学生有一间宿舍。教员比一般学校多一倍，并且绝大部分来自牛津和剑桥等贵族大学。
    在这种公学中，高年级学生对低年级学生有一种绝对的权力，俨然封建时代的统帅和士兵。小孩子还要给大孩子收拾床铺。不仅如此，大孩子还可以给小孩子以体罚。我看到在高年级学生的房间里，放着一根竹鞭，那是专门供打屁股用的。狄更斯在“大卫·考伯菲尔”里所描写的公学情景，到现在还一点也没有改变。这一切，据说是为了培养“领袖品质”，换句话说，就是要充分发扬剥削阶级的本性。
    主任教员告诉我们，他们要把学生培养成“有政治责任感的人，这是因为伊登有一种政治传统”。英国自有首相以来，共总四十多个，其中十八个，包括第一任首相罗伯特·渥耳波尔和现任首相麦克米伦都是来自伊登公学。现在议会中的八分之一的议员、内阁阁员的32.4％、伦敦城大公司董事的30.9％、五大银行董事的29.7％都是毕业于伊登公学。
            “劈柴挑水”的人
    英国的“现代中学”则是专门为了培养“劈柴挑水”的人（教育部通知）。这些学生一般只能学习到十五岁，就不得不离开学校到工厂当学徒。这种学校的学生是被认为“不会用脑”“只会用手”的人。因为他们在十岁的时候，没有通过一种考试。从十岁来判断一个人的才能已是荒谬至极了，但在实际中，这种考试，或者说是“选择”，在九岁、八岁、甚至七岁上就开始了。“选择”的结果只把有限的几个所谓‘聪明’孩子送到“语法学校”，而个别的甚至送入公学（现在伦敦十万中选一个），而绝对大多数都是“不聪明的”，都是“不会用脑”的，送到“现代中学”。资产阶级总爱谈他们的滥调：“社会主义束缚了人的个性”；事实正相反：在资本主义社会，多少有才能的人，在他们还未启蒙的时候就被打上“没有才能”的烙印！
    “现代中学”课程有限，根本谈不上什么系统知识。基本上三门课：算术、英语和历史。对于资本家来说，要能操纵现代化机器，这些都是必要的。一些课程则变成从思想上控制工人运动的工具。许多侵略者和殖民者成了课堂上的英雄。每天上课前祷告，每星期有一个半钟点的宗教课。设备也极差，班次拥挤，据1958年统计，有三分之二以上的班次超过正式规定人数。教员缺乏更是普遍现象，他们工资也极低，许多教员不得不在假日和工余的时间作些其他工作，借以糊口。
    在英国，金钱可以买到教育，买到权势，买到你所需要的一切。所谓“个性”、“民主”、“自由平等”都不过是发臭的金钱关系的帷幕而已。
