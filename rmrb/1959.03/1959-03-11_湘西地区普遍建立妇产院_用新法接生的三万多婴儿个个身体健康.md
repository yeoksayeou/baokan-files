    Maternity Hospitals Universally Established in Western Hunan
    Over 30,000 Babies Delivered Using New Methods Are All Healthy

    (Our report) Since the people's communes were established in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province, maternity hospitals have been universally established in the deep mountain Miao villages and Tujia villages, including high-altitude mountain villages. Over 80% of pregnant women in these maternity hospitals are using new methods of delivery. More than 34,000 babies delivered using new methods are all strong and healthy.

    Before liberation, many infants in Xiangxi contracted tetanus, and the mortality rate was as high as 50%. "Only see mothers conceive, but never see children walk," was a tragic description of the time. After liberation, in order to ensure the health of pregnant women and infants of all ethnic groups, the Party and the government established 512 new-method delivery stations in rural areas, and widely carried out propaganda and education on the benefits of new-method delivery. In recent years, the number of people using new-method delivery has continued to increase, and the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced.

    After the establishment of the people's communes, in order to provide pregnant women with better birthing conditions, the communes established more than 760 maternity hospitals, with 2,765 beds and more than 4,200 midwives, working diligently day and night for the pregnant women.

    Pregnant women of all ethnic groups not only get good rest in the maternity hospitals, but also get good nutrition. The pregnant women in the Laotianchong Miao District Maternity Hospital of the Dongfeng Commune in Fenghuang County can eat glutinous rice porridge and sweet wine cooked by the midwives every day during their delivery period. In the maternity hospital, the pregnant women don't have to worry about anything. Hot meals are delivered to their beds, and the midwives take care of the babies and wash the diapers. The pregnant women receive meticulous care, feeling more loved than at their own mother's home, and warmer than their own homes. (Meng Fanqin)

    湘西地区普遍建立妇产院
    用新法接生的三万多婴儿个个身体健康
    本报讯　湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州人民公社化以后，在深山苗寨、土家族寨等高寒山寨普遍建立了妇产院。在这些妇产院进行新法接生的产妇，已有80％以上。新法接生的三万四千多个婴儿，个个身体健壮。
    解放前的湘西，婴儿得破伤风的很多，死亡率曾高达50％。“只见娘怀胎，不见崽走路”，正是当时悲惨的写照。解放后，党和政府为了确保各民族产妇和婴儿的健康，在农村建立了五百一十二个新法接生站，广泛地开展了新法接生好处多的宣传教育，几年来新法接生的人数不断增多，婴儿的死亡率已大大减少。
    人民公社化后，为了使产妇得到更好的生育条件，各公社共建立了七百六十多个妇产院，设立产床二千七百六十五张，四千二百多名接生员，日夜为产妇辛勤的忙碌着。
    各民族产妇在产院里，不但休息得好，而且获得了良好的营养，凤凰县东风公社老田冲苗区产妇院的产妇们，在产期中每天都能吃上由接生员煮好的糯米稀饭和甜酒。在产妇院里，产妇们什么也不用操心，热菜热饭送到床边，婴儿的服侍、尿片的洗刷都由接生员做。产妇们受到无微不至的关怀，感到比娘家还亲，比自家还温暖。　	（孟繁勤）
