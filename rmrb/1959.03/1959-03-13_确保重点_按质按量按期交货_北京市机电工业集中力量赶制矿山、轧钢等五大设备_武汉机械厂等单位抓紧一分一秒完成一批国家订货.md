　　Ensure Key Projects: Deliver on Time, with Quality, and in Quantity
　　Beijing's electromechanical industry concentrates its efforts on manufacturing five major types of equipment including mining and steel rolling equipment
　　Wuhan Machinery Factory and other units seize every second to complete a batch of state orders.

　　(Our report) Beijing: According to the spirit of "the whole nation as a single chessboard," Beijing's electromechanical industry departments are concentrating their efforts on manufacturing equipment for mining, steel rolling, coal washing, power stations, and irrigation and drainage.

　　Recently, the Beijing Electromechanical Bureau held a special meeting to study the problems existing in the manufacturing of key equipment such as mining and steel rolling equipment. In accordance with the spirit of "emphasizing the important, prioritizing the urgent," it was determined: First, in terms of steel castings, the needs of steel rolling and mining equipment must be met first, and other aspects must make appropriate concessions; second, the balance and allocation of raw materials should be carried out among electromechanical factories in the city to ensure that the raw materials needed for key equipment are given priority; third, organize large-scale production collaboration to ensure the matching of key equipment; fourth, in order to ensure that key equipment becomes finished products and leaves the factory as soon as possible, materials should be put into production in batches and finished products should be produced in batches, changing the past situation where materials were put in in large quantities but finished products could not be produced for a long time. The bureau also instructed relevant factories to complete the production of these key equipment as a top political task, and strive to complete and over fulfill the tasks on time, with quality, and in quantity.

　　At present, factories in Beijing that produce these equipments and have collaborative tasks have been mobilized and put into battle. The Beijing No. 3 General Machinery Factory will produce more than 600 sets of mining equipment and 600 tons of coal washing equipment this year. In order to overcome the difficulty of not having large-scale equipment, they used the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to make indigenous equipment themselves, and used waste materials to make a 12-meter gantry planer and a 5-meter vertical lathe. Because there was not enough space in the factory building, these two self-made large-scale equipment were installed in the open space outside the workshop. The workers are now striving to install a batch of scraper conveyors and bucket elevators in the first quarter. The Beijing Pipe Fittings Factory workers are manufacturing four sets of 500 mm steel rolling mill mainframes for Xinjiang, Ningxia, Henan, and Guangxi this year, which can be assembled successfully this month. In order to rush to produce the boiler-towed machines, the Beijing No. 1 General Machinery Factory adjusted its labor organization and adopted a large number of substitutes on the premise of not affecting the quality of irrigation and drainage machinery. The Beijing Switch Factory, which undertakes many supporting tasks for power stations and steel rolling mills, has produced more than 2,700 sets of high and low voltage switch cabinets since the beginning of this year, and has successively transported these equipments to more than 50 units such as Fuxin Power Station, Fushun Power Plant, and Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. Now the factory's employees are actively striving to complete the production task of 1,800 high and low voltage switch cabinets in March, and are actively trying to equip the more than 8,000 sets of semi-finished high and low voltage switch cabinets that have been accumulated in the past.

　　(Our report) Wuhan: The employees of Wuhan Machinery Factory and the affiliated factory of Wuhan Electromechanical Bureau Installation Company resolutely implemented the policy of "the whole nation as a single chessboard," and carried out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy with technological revolution as the center. They completed and over fulfilled the manufacturing tasks of 135 units of simple No. 2 coking equipment 2K9 water pumps and 145 units of electric motors at the end of February and the beginning of March respectively.

　　When assigning tasks, both factories emphasized the importance of completing the manufacturing task of Hongqi No. 2 coking furnace equipment to support the steel marshal. After accepting the task, the employees of the casting workshop and the metalworking workshop 2 of Wuhan Machinery Factory carried out extensive debate and discussion, and their enthusiasm was soaring. They put forward measures and guarantees, and overcame difficulties through self-reliance. In the past, the mud core for turning the water pump impeller in the casting workshop was made of white sand cement, and it needed to be dried in natural air, and each impeller needed 12 hours to dry. According to this method, it was impossible to complete the task at all. In order to save time and supply the processing workshop in advance, technicians and old skilled workers jointly used their brains to change the white sand cement to tung oil sand and dry it with fire, which greatly improved the production efficiency and could make 40 pieces a day. Many new workers adopted high-speed cutting and increased the amount of feed, and the vehicle speed was increased from more than 200 revolutions to more than 400 revolutions, generally increasing work efficiency by more than one time. The fitter assembly team also improved the operation method, implemented assembly line operation, assembled as soon as it was processed, tested water as soon as it was assembled, and painted as soon as it was tested, one link interlocking with another. Although there were still 40 water pumps to be assembled on February 27, and the parts for these 40 units were still being processed. However, thanks to the workers, seizing every second, the processing, assembly, water testing, and painting were arranged on the assembly line, which greatly accelerated the production progress. By February 27, 135 water pumps were completed, which was five units more than required by the Municipal Electromechanical Bureau one day in advance.

　　The employees of the affiliated factory of Wuhan Electromechanical Installation Company, who had never had batch production tasks, carried forward the style of daring to think and daring to do, and accepted the task of producing electric motors under the condition of weak technical strength. The vast number of workers worked hard and skillfully, improved operation methods, and solved many key production issues. He Changxiu's punching die group changed the silicon iron stator that needed to be filed and grinded to no filing and no grinding, saving 14 hours for each electric motor than before. At the same time, the tools and molds were improved, and multiple fixtures were adopted to improve efficiency. In the past, it took 14 and a half hours to machine an electric motor, but now it only takes 6 hours. Due to the improvement of operation, the working hours for embedding wires were reduced from 8 hours per electric motor to 2 hours. Due to the workers' active technological innovation and improved operation, a total of 145 units were completed by March 3, which was two days ahead of the target set by the Municipal Electromechanical Bureau and exceeded the target by ten units. At present, this factory is going all out and moving forward victoriously, and has put forward the slogan of three guarantees - guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing output, and guaranteeing use, to ensure that the manufacturing task of 215 electric motors will be completed before March 15.

    确保重点　按质按量按期交货
    北京市机电工业集中力量赶制矿山、轧钢等五大设备
    武汉机械厂等单位抓紧一分一秒完成一批国家订货
    本报讯　北京市机电工业部门根据全国一盘棋的精神，正集中力量赶制矿山、轧钢、洗煤、电站、排灌等设备。
    最近，北京市机电局专门召开会议，研究制造矿山、轧钢等重点设备中存在的问题。依据“重其所重，急其所急”的精神，确定：一、在铸钢件方面，首先要满足轧钢、矿山等设备的需要，其他方面要适当让路；二、在全市机电工厂中进行原材料的平衡调剂工作，保证优先满足重点设备所需的原材料；三、组织生产大协作，保证重点设备配套；四、为了使重点设备都成为成品早日出厂，要做到投一批料就出一批成品，改变过去将料大批投入而成品迟迟不能出厂的状况。这个局并责成有关工厂，要把生产这些重点设备做为头等的政治任务来完成，并力争按时、按质、按量完成和提前完成。
    目前北京市生产这些设备及有协作任务的工厂，已紧张动员起来投入战斗。北京市第三通用机械厂今年要生产六百多台矿山设备和六百吨洗选设备。为了克服没有大型设备的困难，他们用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法自制土设备，用废料制成了一台十二公尺龙门刨和一台五公尺立车，厂房不够用，就把这两台自制的大型设备安装在车间外面的空地上。工人们现在正争取在第一季度就安装出一批刮板运输机和斗子式提升机。北京市管件厂工人今年为新疆、宁夏、河南、广西制造的四套五百公厘的轧钢机主机，本月份就可以组装成功。北京市第一通用机械厂为了赶制锅驼机，调整了劳动组织，并且在不影响排灌机械质量的原则下，采用了大量的代用品。担负着很多电站、轧钢机配套任务的北京市开关厂，今年以来已经生产了二千七百多台高低压开关柜，并且已经陆续把这些设备运到阜新电站、抚顺电厂、重庆钢铁公司等五十多个单位。现在这个厂的职工一面积极争取在3月份完成一千八百台高低压开关柜的生产任务，一面积极想办法将过去积压下来的八千多台高低压开关柜的半成品配制成套。
    本报讯　武汉机械厂、武汉市机电局安装公司附属厂职工，坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，深入开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，分别在2月底和3月初完成和超额完成了简易二号焦化设备2K9水泵一百三十五台，电动机一百四十五台的制造任务。
    这两个厂在布置任务时，都强调指出了完成红旗二号焦炉设备制造任务对支援钢铁元帅的重要意义。武汉机械厂铸造车间和金工二车间职工接受任务后，经过深入开展大鸣大放大辩论，干劲冲天，意气风发，纷纷提措施提保证，自力更生克服困难。铸造车间翻水泵叶轮的泥心过去是用白砂水泥做的，要自然空气干燥，每个叶轮干燥需十二小时。按照这个办法，根本无法完成任务。为了争取时间，提前供应加工车间，技术人员和老技术工人共同开动脑筋，将白砂水泥改为桐油砂，用火烘干，大大地提高了生产效率，每天能做四十个。许多新工人采用高速切削，加大走刀量，车速由二百多转提高到四百多转，一般提高工效一倍以上。钳工装配组也改进了操作方法，实行流水作业，加工好了就总装，总装好了就试水，试好了水就刷油漆，一环扣一环。虽然到2月27日还有四十台水泵要总装，而且这四十台零件还在加工。但是由于工人群众，抓紧了一分一秒，由加工、总装、试水、油漆摆开了流水线，大大加快了生产进度，至2月27日就完成了一百三十五台水泵，比市机电局要求提前一天超额五台完成任务。
    从来没有成批生产任务的武汉市机电安装公司附属厂职工发扬了敢想敢干的风格，在技术力量薄弱的条件下，接受了生产电动机的任务。广大工人群众苦干巧干，改进操作方法，解决了许多生产关键。何昌秀冲模小组将要锉要磨的矽铁定子改为不锉不磨，每一台电动机比过去节约十四小时。同时改进了工模具，采用多夹具，提高了效率。以前车一台电动机需十四小时半，现只需六小时。由于改进操作，嵌线的工时由以前一台电动机需八小时，降低到二小时。由于工人群众积极革新技术，改进操作，到3月3日共计完成了一百四十五台，比市机电局下达指标提前二天超额十台完成任务。目前这个工厂正鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，提出了三包——包质包产包用的口号，保证在3月15日以前完成二百一十五台电动机的制造任务。（附图片）
