    (Our dispatch) Nanning—The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which historically has rarely cultivated cotton, plans to plant 200,000 mu this year and has decided to gradually achieve cotton self-sufficiency within three years.

    Last December, relevant departments in the autonomous region successively transferred large quantities of Dai Zi Cotton No. 15 and Guannong No. 1 cotton seeds from Hubei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and other provinces. In order to solve the technical problems of cotton cultivation, various localities organized on-site meetings and training courses. A total of 341 people were trained in the four special districts of Yulin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning. The cotton planting training course held in Nanning Special District specially invited a group of cotton farmers and technical cadres with rich cotton planting experience from Xinxiang Special District and the Anyang Agricultural Science Research Institute in Henan to teach cotton planting techniques.

    At present, various localities are actively preparing for planting.

    广西争取三年内用棉自给
    本报讯　历史上很少种植棉花的广西僮族自治区，今年计划种植二十万亩，并决定在三年内逐步做到棉花自给。
    去年12月，自治区有关部门已陆续从湖北、辽宁、江苏等省调入大批岱字棉十五号、关农一号棉种。为了解决种棉的栽培技术问题，各地分别组织了现场会议和训练班。玉林、柳州、梧州、南宁等四个专区共训练了三百四十一人；南宁专区举办的植棉训练班，特从河南新乡专区和安阳农业科学研究所，请来一批富有植棉经验的棉农和技术干部，传授种棉栽培技术。
    目前，各地都在积极着手种植前的各项准备工作。
