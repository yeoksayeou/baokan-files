　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) yesterday sent three representatives, including Yoshio Shiga, to hand over a proposal to the Acting Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Tomomi Narita, suggesting that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party strengthen cooperation in the upcoming local elections and House of Councillors elections, and hold talks for this purpose.
    The proposal pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet are attempting to collude with U.S. imperialism to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," forcing the Japanese people to embark on the path of militarism and imperialism, and dragging them into wars of aggression. At this time, Japan's democratic forces must win in the upcoming elections and thoroughly crush the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty."
    The Japanese Communist Party pointed out in the proposal that the reason why the LDP candidates were elected in the recent gubernatorial elections was because the Japanese democratic forces, including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, had not established a solid system of unified action.
    The proposal pointed out that the "Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Maintenance of Peace and Democracy," with the participation of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and all mass organizations, was established some time ago in Tokyo. This organization decided to unite to fight for the victory of the democratic forces' candidates. Soon, a nationwide joint struggle conference, including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will be established, which shows the common will of the democratic forces with the working class as the core.
    The proposal pointed out that, in particular, the Tokyo gubernatorial election will have a great impact on the House of Councillors elections and local elections, so it is requested that the Socialist Party especially strengthen cooperation with the Communist Party in this election.
    The proposal asks the Socialist Party to respond to the people's demand for the realization of unity among the democratic forces and to express a clear attitude.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with more than three million members, formally decided at a standing executive committee meeting held on the 14th to participate in the nationwide joint struggle organization -- the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision and Strive for the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" -- and conduct a joint struggle with the Japanese Communist Party.
    This is the first time that Sohyo has decided to conduct a joint struggle with the Communist Party.
    At the standing executive committee meeting, Sohyo also decided to form an executive committee centered on Sohyo in order to launch a signature campaign for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The standing executive committee also made decisions on the spring struggle and promoting contact with trade unions in Asia and Africa.

    日本共产党向社会党提出建议书
    主张两党在未来选举中加强合作
    总评决定同日共联合斗争废除“安全条约”
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会昨天派志贺义雄等三位代表把一份建议书交给社会党代理书记长成田知已，建议社会党和共产党在即将举行的地方选举和参议员选举中加强合作，并为此举行会谈。
    建议书指出，自由民主党和岸信介内阁正在企图同美帝国主义勾结起来修改日美“安全条约”，强迫日本人民走军国主义和帝国主义的道路，并卷进侵略战争中。在这个时候，日本的民主力量必须在即将到来的选举中取得胜利，一定要彻底打击修改“安全条约”的阴谋。
    日本共产党在建议书中指出，自由民主党候选人在最近举行的几次知事选举中所以当选，是因为包括社会党和共产党在内的日本民主力量没有建立巩固的统一行动体制。
    建议书指出，前些时候在东京成立了有社会党和共产党以及所有群众团体参加的“东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议”，这个组织决定要联合起来为使民主力量的候选人获得胜利而斗争。不久又将成立包括社会党和共产党在内的阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的全国规模的联合斗争会议，这表明了以工人阶级为核心的民主力量的共同意志。
    建议书指出，特别是东京都知事选举，将会给参议员选举和地方选举以很大的影响，所以要求社会党特别要在这次选举中和共产党加强合作。
    建议书要求社会党回答人民要求民主力量实现统一的意见，并且表示明确的态度。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会在14日举行的常任干事会会议上，正式决定参加全国各界的联合斗争组织——“阻止修改和争取废除日美安全条约国民会议”，同日本共产党进行联合斗争。
    这是总评议会第一次决定同共产党进行联合斗争。
    总评议会在常任干事会会议上还决定，为了展开废除日美“安全条约”的签名运动，将组成一个以总评议会为中心的实行委员会。
    常任干事会还就春季斗争和促进同亚非地区工会间的接触问题作出了决定。
