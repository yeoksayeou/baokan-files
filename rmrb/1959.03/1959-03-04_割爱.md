    A Leap Forward Essay

    Cutting Love

    "Cutting love" has always been a virtue praised by people. In the old society, we often heard "enduring the pain to cut love," which was a last resort. In the era of the socialist Great Leap Forward, countless touching stories of cutting love have emerged. People summarize these stories in one sentence: "Give convenience to others." The four words "give to others" are worth savoring carefully, as they reveal the communist style of people being happy to cut love and brave enough to cut love.

    The People's Daily published two news items on February 24th. One was about the Beijing Automobile Factory deciding to reduce its original plan to manufacture sedans in order to complete the production tasks of accessories for the Changchun Automobile Factory and the Luoyang Tractor Factory. Some people may feel that this is enduring the pain to cut love, but the slogan of the comrades at the Beijing Automobile Factory is: it is glorious to produce cars, and it is equally glorious to produce car accessories; this is done happily.

    The other news item was about Anhui Province transporting pig iron to support Shanghai and other places, transferring more than 105,000 tons of pig iron in just over a month. Not only was the quantity large and the quality high, but it was also guaranteed to be delivered in a timely manner. The comrades in Anhui also listed this matter as one of their important tasks. What a moving spirit this initiative is!

    Our slogan is only one: the whole country is a chessboard. People focus on the overall situation, are happy to cut love, and are brave enough to cut love. With "happiness" and "courage," we can smoothly achieve the whole country working together to ensure the needs of key production and construction, thereby driving the country to a greater leap forward.

    割爱
    古田
    “割爱”一直是被人称颂的美德，在旧社会，常常听到的是“忍痛割爱”，这是不得已而为之。社会主义大跃进的时代，涌现了无数动人的割爱的故事。人们把这些故事概括为一句话：“把方便送给别人”。“送给别人”这四个字很值得细细咀嚼，它道出了人们乐于割爱和勇于割爱的共产主义风格。
    人民日报2月24日刊载两则消息。一则是北京汽车制造厂，为了完成长春汽车厂和洛阳拖拉机厂附件的生产任务，决定削减原来制造小轿车的计划。也许有人会觉得这是忍痛割爱，可是北京汽车厂同志们的口号却是：生产汽车光荣，生产汽车附件同样光荣；这是乐而为之的。
    另一则消息是安徽省运生铁支援上海等地，一个多月就调出生铁十万五千多吨。不仅量大质高，而且保证及时送到。安徽同志并且还把这件事列为重要工作之一。这种主动精神又是多么动人啊！
    我们的口号只有一个：全国一盘棋。人们从全局着眼，乐于割爱，勇于割爱。有了“乐”和“勇”，就能顺利实现全国一齐动手，保证重点生产建设的需要，从而带动全国更大跃进。
