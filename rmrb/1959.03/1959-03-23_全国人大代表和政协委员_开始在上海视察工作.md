Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 22nd: Deputies to the Second National People's Congress and members of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) began inspection work in Shanghai on the 21st.

On the morning of the 21st, the deputies and members attended a symposium held by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee to discuss the specific itinerary and locations for the inspection work. Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, expressed a warm welcome on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee to the deputies and members for their inspection work, hoping that they would promptly raise any issues discovered during the inspection in order to further promote the leap forward in various tasks in Shanghai. Cao Diqiu briefed the deputies and members on the situation of Shanghai's industrial and agricultural production and various other tasks.

More than 70 people, including Zhong Min, Zhou Gucheng, Su Buqing, Chen Wangdao, Liao Shicheng, Wu Yaozong, Zhao Zukang, Rong Yiren, and Xie Xuetang, are participating in the inspection work in Shanghai. The deputies and members are very concerned about the situation of the great leap forward in Shanghai's industry and agriculture. They have formed seven inspection groups and, after listening to briefings from the heads of various units, will go to grassroots units such as factories, suburban people's communes, science and culture, and judicial departments for inspection.

Wang Shao'ao, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, and Weng Wenhao, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, also came from Beijing to participate in the inspection work in Shanghai.
