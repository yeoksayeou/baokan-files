This newspaper Urumqi dispatch: Party and government leaders in the Halajun pastoral area of ​​Atushi County, Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, are focusing on livestock production in conjunction with rectifying people's communes in pastoral areas. Aiming at the specific circumstances of the current "lambing" season in the pastoral area, the pastoral area leaders have listed seven important items and launched a "seven checks" campaign throughout the region (checking pastures, checking sheds, checking fodder, checking allocation of lambing personnel, checking lamb survival, checking feeding of general livestock and breeding stock, checking livestock mating), discovering and resolving problems in a timely manner, which has greatly promoted the current work of protecting livestock and raising lambs.

The pastoral area has a total of three townships. In the checking of fodder and sheds, it was found that the third township lacked grass, and forces were immediately organized to transport 25,330 bundles of green hay from the Tianshan pastoral area, solving the forage needed for ewes to give birth. The sheds in the first township were not enough, and the district allocated ten yurts, so that the ewes and lambs had sheds to live in.

The district found in the "seven checks" campaign that to further develop animal husbandry, one of the more important items is to improve the political awareness and scientific and technological knowledge of herders. To this end, a herdsmen training class was held in the first township, allowing the existing 19 students to study the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee, meteorological knowledge, and feeding and veterinary courses; and preparations are being made to conduct rotational training for all herders.

    新疆哈拉俊牧区加强保畜
    本报乌鲁木齐讯　新疆克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州阿图什县哈拉俊牧区党政领导，结合整顿牧区人民公社，大抓牧业生产。这个牧区针对当前牧区收获“产羔”季节的具体情况，排列出七个重要项目，在全区开展“七查”运动（查牧场、查棚圈、查草料、查接羔人员配备、查羊羔成活、查一般牲畜和种畜的喂养、查牲畜交配），发现问题及时解决，大大推动了当前的保畜工作和接羔育羔工作。
    这个牧区共有三个乡，在查草料、查棚圈中，发现三乡草不足，立即组织力量由天山牧区中运出两万五千三百三十把青干草，解决了母畜产羔所需的饲草。一乡圈棚不够用，区上给调剂了十个毡房，使产羔母羊和羊羔都有了棚圈住。
    这个区在“七查”运动中发现，要进一步发展畜牧业，更重要项目之一是必须提高牧放人员的政治觉悟和科学技术知识。为此，在一乡举办了牧工训练班，让现有十九个学员学习八届六中全会决议、气象知识和饲养、兽医等课程；并准备对所有牧工进行轮训。
