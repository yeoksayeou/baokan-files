Li River's spring waters are lush green,
Fine rain and overcast skies accompany our journey.
We can't take in all the wondrous mountains along the way,
Our boat moors beneath the Green Lotus Peak.

Venturing to Yangshuo in the rain,
It's rare to encounter such beautiful scenery.
How many turns of the Li River,
Ten thousand points of Guilin's peaks.

Sailing downstream, discussions are unhindered,
Returning by road, the path is not circuitous.
The region is leaping forward again,
And the beautiful scenery is even more enhanced.
