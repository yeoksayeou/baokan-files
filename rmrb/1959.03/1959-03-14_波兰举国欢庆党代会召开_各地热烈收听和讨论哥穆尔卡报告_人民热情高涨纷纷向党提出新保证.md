Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 13th. The convening of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party has become a major event in the lives of the Polish people. Since the opening of the congress, factories, mines, government offices, and schools across Poland have greeted this significant event with soaring enthusiasm.

　　When the congress was declared open on the 10th, crowds of people in cities and villages across the country stood by radios, broadcasting stations, and television sets to listen to the news of the meeting. Many factory workers listened to Gomulka's report while working. Farmers throughout the province of Krakow listened to the congress broadcast.

　　On the morning of the 11th, newspapers carrying Gomulka's report were quickly sold out. Party organizations in many enterprises have already begun discussing the report. Many factory representatives attending the congress are using their breaks to meet with workers and report on the progress of the congress.

　　The working people of Poland have greeted the ongoing Party Congress with soaring labor enthusiasm. On the opening day of the meeting, workers in many enterprises held rallies to summarize the pledges made in preparation for the Party Congress and put forward new pledges.

　　The staff and workers of the "Oswiecim" Chemical Plant said in a telegram to the presidium of the congress that, as a result of their special guarantee, the production task for the first quarter would be completed eight days ahead of schedule.

　　Workers at the Warsaw Automobile Factory, the Luxembourg Factory, the "July 22nd" Candy Factory, and many construction enterprises in Warsaw organized production shock brigades. Workers at the Krakow Electrical Materials Factory pledged to master the production of special cables before March 20th. In Poland, all of this type of cable has so far relied entirely on imports. The city of Krakow also held an exhibition introducing the history of the Polish workers' movement and the achievements of the people's government.

　　Thanks to the initiative of the masses, the Gdansk Television Center brought forward the date of delivering television sets for use, enabling television viewers to see the Third Congress.

　　On the opening day of the congress, construction began in the Lublin workers' district on the city's first school to be built in commemoration of the millennium of the founding of Poland. Workers from ten enterprises in the area and local residents will jointly build this school.

    10日代表大会宣布开幕的时候，在全国各城市和乡村里有成群的人站在收音机、广播站和电视机旁收听会议消息。很多工厂的工人们一边工作，一边听着哥穆尔卡的报告。克拉科夫省全省的农民都听了代表大会的广播。
    11日早晨，刊登着哥穆尔卡的报告的报纸很快就被买光。很多企业的党组织中已经开始讨论这个报告。参加代表大会的许多工厂的代表都利用休会时间和工人会面，向他们报告代表大会的进行情况。
    波兰的劳动人民以高涨的劳动热情迎接了正在进行的党代表大会。会议开幕的当天，许多企业的工人纷纷举行集会，总结为迎接党代表大会提出的保证，同时提出了新的保证。
    “奥斯文采姆”化工厂职工在给代表大会主席团的电报中说，由于他们进行了特别的保证，第一季度的生产任务将比原订计划提前八天完成。
    华沙汽车厂、卢森堡工厂、“7月22日”糖果工厂和华沙许多建筑企业的职工都组织了生产突击队。克拉科夫电料厂的职工提出保证，在3月20日以前掌握特种电缆的生产。在波兰这种电缆至今全是依靠进口的。克拉科夫市还举办了介绍波兰工人运动历史和人民政权成就的展览会。
    革但斯克电视中心由于群众的倡议提前了交付电视机使用的日期，因而使电视观众们能够看到第三次代表大会的电视。
