Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 14th. More than 1,500 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region gathered on the 14th to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the Autonomous Region.

At the celebration meeting, Liu Jianxun, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, delivered the opening speech, congratulating the great achievements made by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the past year. Liu Jianxun said: Practice has proved that our socialist construction cause must advance with great leaps forward. Although Guangxi's level of productivity development is not high and the construction foundation is relatively poor, these cannot stop us from moving forward. The argument that backward areas cannot leap forward is fundamentally untenable. They have not seen the infinite power contained in the people of all ethnic groups, and under the leadership of the Party, this power will be maximized and create great miracles. Liu Jianxun emphasized: Guangxi's great leap forward last year was achieved by constantly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and the erroneous thinking of "Guangxi's backwardness." He said that as long as we continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, muster greater energy than last year, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region, we can firmly believe that when we celebrate the second anniversary of the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi's appearance will undergo even greater changes.

Next, Wei Guoqing, Chairman of the Autonomous Region, spoke at the meeting. He first represented the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi to thank the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao for their care for the people of Guangxi. He spoke in detail about the brilliant achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in all aspects under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction. When he talked about Guangxi's victory over the threat of a severe drought last year, and the total grain output of the region in 1958 increased by more than double that of 1957, and the average grain output per mu reached 800 jin, the venue cheered, because when the autonomous region was established last year, it was announced that an average yield of 800 jin per mu would be achieved in the next six years, and now it has been achieved in one year. Wei Guoqing said that the achievements of Guangxi's industrial front last year were also unprecedented, with the total investment in industrial capital construction increasing two and a half times compared with 1957. In the mass movement to vigorously develop steel, the pig iron produced was equivalent to about fifty times the average annual output of pig iron during the region's first five-year plan period. Because of the victory of the "Marshal of Steel", all industrial sectors have achieved an all-round leap forward. After the realization of people's communes in the vast rural areas of the region, it further greatly promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Wei Guoqing finally called on the people of all ethnic groups in the region to, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, muster greater revolutionary energy, sum up and carry forward the experience of the great leap forward last year, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

Nguyen Mai, Acting Consul of the Consulate General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Nanning, was invited to attend today's celebration meeting. Zhu Wenjin, Chairman of the Administrative Committee of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also sent a telegram of congratulations.

On the evening of the 14th, a get-together party was also held to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 14th. Since the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region a year ago, great achievements have been made in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, which fully proves the correctness and greatness of the Party's ethnic policy.

In this year, the total industrial and agricultural output value of Guangxi increased by 95% compared with 1957. In agriculture, overcoming the threat of severe drought, an unprecedented bumper harvest of food crops was achieved, and the total grain output of the region increased by more than double that of 1957, realizing the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule; at the same time, great progress has also been made in cash crops, forestry, and animal husbandry production. In industry, the policy of the whole party and the whole people running industry has been implemented. The total investment in industrial capital construction increased by 267.5% compared with 1957; the small-scale industries run by townships and communes have also developed significantly. In just a few months, the region's pig iron production was equivalent to fifty times the average annual output of pig iron during Guangxi's first five-year plan period. The output of raw coal increased by 573% compared with 1957, power generation increased by 39.2%, and the production of machine tools, gasifiers, gasoline engines, electric motors and other mechanical industries has also increased significantly. In terms of transportation, the Dongluo, Tunqiu, and Yangliu railway branch lines have been completed or are about to be completed. In addition, 6,184 kilometers of highways and more than 9,000 kilometers of rural roads have been newly built or repaired. Significant progress has also been made in commerce, culture, education, health, and people's welfare.

With the great leap forward in production and the improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses of the people, the region realized the communization of the people in August last year. From the date of its establishment, the people's commune has shown strong vitality and great superiority, which has strongly promoted the great development of production and various tasks.

The great achievements made by the autonomous region last year have once again powerfully proved the correctness and greatness of the Party's ethnic policy with glorious facts. The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have formed close fighting friendship in the revolutionary struggles they jointly carried out in the past, and the establishment of the autonomous region has further developed this friendship. In the great leap forward, the people of all ethnic groups have widely carried out communist cooperation, supported each other, visited and compared with each other, and launched friendship competitions with each other. The development of this great unity and great cooperation among ethnic groups has greatly promoted the leap forward in production in the autonomous region. Many minority nationality areas with relatively backward agricultural production in the past, such as Sanjiang, Longsheng, and Jingxi counties, have stood at the forefront of high yield in the region in the great leap forward last year.

This year, Guangxi will achieve a greater leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. According to the plan, the output of grain, steel, iron, and coal in the region will increase even more this year than last year. In order to ensure the realization of this year's leap forward plan, a vigorous mass movement is currently being launched throughout the region, setting off a greater upsurge in production.

    庆祝僮族自治区一年的光辉成就
    广西各族人民举行盛大集会
    新华社南宁14日电　广西僮族自治区各族各界人士一千五百多人，14日集会庆祝自治区成立一周年纪念。
    在庆祝会上，自治区党委第一书记刘建勋致开幕词，祝贺广西僮族自治区成立一年来的伟大成就。刘建勋说：实践证明，我们的社会主义建设事业，必须采取大跃进的步伐前进。虽然广西生产力的发展水平还不高，建设基础还比较差，但是这些都不能阻止我们前进。那种认为落后地区就不能跃进的论调，是根本站不住脚的。他们没有看到各族人民中蕴藏着无穷的力量，在党的领导下，这种力量将得到最大限度的发挥，创造出伟大的奇迹。刘建勋强调指出：广西去年的大跃进，也就是在不断克服右倾保守思想和“广西落后论”的错误思想下实现的。他说，只要我们继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，鼓起比去年更大的干劲，把全自治区各族人民的积极性和创造性充分发挥起来，可以坚信：在庆祝广西僮族自治区成立第二周年时，广西的面貌将会出现更大的改变。
    接着，自治区主席韦国清在会上讲话。他首先代表广西各族人民感谢党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席对广西人民的关怀。他详细地讲到各族人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，各个方面取得的光辉成绩。当他讲到广西去年战胜严重旱灾的威胁，1958年全区粮食总产量比1957年增长了一倍多，粮食平均每亩产量已经达到八百斤时，会场欢腾，因为去年自治区成立的时候，曾宣布在今后六年内实现平均亩产八百斤，现在一年就实现了。韦国清说，去年广西工业战线上的成就也是史无前例的，工业基建投资总额比1957年增长两倍半。在大搞钢铁的群众运动中，生产的生铁相当于全区第一个五年计划期间生铁平均年产量的五十倍左右，由于钢铁元帅的胜利升帐，带动所有工业部门都获得全面跃进。全区广大农村实现人民公社化以后，又进一步大大地促进了工农业生产的发展。
    韦国清最后号召全区各族人民在1958年大跃进的基础上，鼓足更大的革命干劲，总结和发扬去年大跃进的经验，争取今年实现一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    越南民主共和国驻南宁领事馆代领事阮梅应邀出席了今天的庆祝会。越南民主共和国越北自治区行政委员会主席朱文晋，也来电祝贺。
    14日晚上，还举行了庆祝自治区成立一周年的联欢晚会。
    新华社南宁14日电　广西僮族自治区成立一年来，在工农业生产和各项建设事业中都取得了很大成绩，充分证明了党的民族政策的正确、伟大。
    在这一年中，广西工农业总产值比1957年增长了95％。在农业方面，战胜了严重旱灾的威胁，粮食作物获得了史无前例的大丰收，全区粮食总产量比1957年增长了一倍以上，提前实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标；同时在经济作物、林业和畜牧业生产等方面也有了很大发展。在工业方面，贯彻执行了全党全民办工业的方针。工业基本建设投资总额比1957年增长267.5％；乡、社举办的小型工业也有了显著的发展。全区在短短的几个月内，生产的生铁就相当于广西第一个五年计划期间生铁平均年产量的五十倍。原煤产量比1957年增长573％，发电量增长39.2％，机床、煤汽机、汽油机、电动机等机械工业生产也都有了很大增长。在交通运输业方面，岽罗、屯秋、杨柳等三条铁路支线已经建成或即将建成，另外还新建或修建了六千一百八十四公里公路和九千多公里乡村大路。在商业、文教卫生和生活福利事业等方面也都有了显著发展。
    随着生产大跃进和广大人民思想觉悟的提高，去年8月间全区实现了人民公社化。人民公社从建立日起，就显出了强大的生命力和极大的优越性，有力地推动了生产和各项工作的大发展。
    自治区去年取得的这些伟大成绩，又一次以光辉的事实，有力地证明了党的民族政策的正确、伟大。广西各族人民在过去共同进行的革命斗争中，结成了亲密的战斗友谊，自治区的成立使他们这种友谊得到了更进一步的发展。在大跃进中，各族人民之间广泛开展了共产主义大协作，互相支援，互相参观评比，互相展开友谊竞赛。这种大团结、大协作的民族关系的发展，大大推动了自治区生产的跃进。许多过去农业生产比较落后的少数民族地区，如三江、龙胜和靖西等县，在去年大跃进中都站到全区高产的前列。
    今年，广西将要在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现更大的跃进。根据计划，今年全区粮食、钢、铁、煤炭的产量都将比去年有更大的增长。为了保证实现今年的跃进计划，目前在全区范围内展开了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，掀起了更大的生产高潮。
