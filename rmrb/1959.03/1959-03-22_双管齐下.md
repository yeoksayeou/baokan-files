    Taking Two Approaches Simultaneously
    Qin Li
    I received letters from Comrade Wang Jinxiang and Wang Huaiting, teachers at Fengtai Nanyuan Middle School, saying that they wanted to buy some better literary and art books published in the past two or three years for their students to read, but they couldn't find them in many bookstores. They hope that the relevant departments can solve this problem.
    As far as I know, many readers have similar troubles and hopes. I think this issue is indeed worth studying.
    Some time ago, newspapers suggested that dramas should perform repertoire programs, and good movies should be re-screened. Shouldn't good books also be reprinted according to the needs of readers?
    Good plays and good movies will not lose their value because they are performed once or twice, and the same is true for good books. Some good books have been published, but not everyone has read them. Later, readers see book reviews in newspapers and periodicals and learn about some good books, generating a desire to read these good books. Therefore, it is still necessary to appropriately reprint some good books to meet the needs of these readers.
    However, the problem is not entirely a shortage of books; there also seem to be some problems with distribution. Some books, according to their print runs, could have met the needs of readers, but problems arose due to shortcomings in the distribution work: they were stockpiled here, but unavailable there. It seems that to solve the problem of book shortages, publishing and distribution must work closely together, taking two approaches simultaneously. The eighth edition of the People's Daily once introduced the "Decoration" magazine published in Beijing, and many readers from other places wrote to the editorial department saying that they had never seen it and could not buy it. Can this really be said to be just because the magazine's print run was insufficient?

    双管齐下

    接到丰台南苑中学教师王晋祥、王怀亭两位同志的来信，说他们想买一些前两三年出版的比较好的文艺书，供学生阅读，跑了许多书店都买不到。他们希望有关方面能解决这一问题。
    据我知道，有不少读者有类似的苦恼和希望。我想，这个问题确实值得研究研究。
    前些时候，报纸上提出，戏剧要上演保留节目，好的电影应该重映。是不是好书也应该根据读者的需要再版出书呢？
    好戏，好电影不会因上演一次两次就失去了它的价值，好书也是这样。有些好书出版了，但不是所有的人都读到了。以后，读者看到了报刊的书评，知道了有这么一些好书，产生了看这些好书的愿望，因此，适当地再版一些好书，满足这些读者的需要，还是应该的。
    但是问题还不完全在于书缺，发行上似乎也还有些问题。有的书照印数来说，本来是可以满足读者需要的，只是因为发行工作有缺点，才发生了问题：这里积压，那里又买不到。看来，要解决缺书的问题，还须出版和发行紧密配合，双管齐下才行。人民日报第八版曾经介绍过在北京出版的“装饰”杂志，就有许多外地读者写信给编辑部说从来没有看到过，也买不到。这难道能说只是因为杂志的印数不够么？
