    On the Evaluation of Some Films of 1957
    Yuan Wenshu Chen Huangmei
    Editor's Note: Published below are the exchanged letters between comrades Yuan Wenshu and Chen Huangmei regarding comrade Chen Huangmei's article "Resolutely Uproot the White Flags on the Silver Screen." This article was published in this newspaper on December 2nd of last year. We believe that the opinions raised by comrade Yuan Wenshu are basically correct. Our handling of this article also has shortcomings.
            (I)
  Comrade Huangmei:
    I heard that you have returned from abroad. I hope you are well.
    After reading your article "Resolutely Uproot the White Flags on the Silver Screen" published in the "People's Daily" on December 2nd of last year, I felt that I had some opinions I wanted to discuss with you, but at that time you were far abroad, and I thought you must be very busy, so I did not want to bother you with a letter. Although two months have passed, I still feel it is necessary to discuss those issues, so I am now presenting my personal views for your correction.
    First of all, I think that after you affirmed the achievements made in Chinese film art creation in 1957, it was very necessary to criticize the various bourgeois ideas expressed in some films, and many of your opinions are also very valuable. Looking back at the period from the winter of 1956 to the spring and summer of 1957, under the attack of the rightists and the influence of revisionist thought, the entire film front was filled with miasma and heresies, and many creative personnel lost their direction. As a result, some films with erroneous ideas and distorted realities of life were produced, which was indeed a painful experience and lesson. As you pointed out, "Since the vast majority of film artists are bourgeois intellectuals, their original standpoints have not been completely changed, so their works often express bourgeois thoughts, feelings, and tastes. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the film industry has criticized some films with serious erroneous ideas, and the broad masses of film artists have been educated. ... However, the problem has not been completely solved, the bourgeois kingdom in the depths of the soul has not been completely destroyed, and under the influence of revisionist ideas at home and abroad, these dregs have resurfaced." This analysis is completely correct.
    Fortunately, under the leadership of the Party, after a fierce rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the above situation on the film front was changed, the Party's leadership was consolidated, the direction of the film industry was corrected, and the bourgeois rightists were isolated. On the basis of thoroughly destroying various bourgeois artistic viewpoints, the ideological consciousness of film workers has also been improved to varying degrees, thereby creating conditions for the great leap forward in the film industry in 1958. It can be said that without the rectification in 1957, the great leap forward in 1958 would have been impossible. The facts are before our eyes: film production in 1958 increased more than twofold compared with 1957, creative personnel began to contact the masses, and the spiritual outlook of creative personnel also changed greatly. Of course, the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology on the film front is a long-term one. In order to better accept this experience and lesson, and to give all creative personnel a clear understanding, so as to speed up their ideological transformation and improve the level of film creation, a serious analysis and criticism of the shortcomings and errors in past films is completely necessary. Therefore, many of the issues you pointed out in this article are of positive significance to our future work.
    However, after reading the article, in addition to gaining the above benefits, I also felt some dissatisfaction and disagreement in my views, so I am now willing to raise them for your discussion.
    First of all, I think it is inappropriate for you to distinguish problems from the film style, classify comedy films into one category for criticism, which will inevitably confuse many comedy films with different error natures, or only some shortcomings. Under the subheading "Abusing satire, using 'reflecting reality' and 'intervening in life' as excuses to directly attack the Party and the new society, and opposing the leadership of the Party," you criticized "An Unfinished Comedy" and many films such as "Who is the Abandoned One," "Seeking Love," "Football Match Incident," "Three Comrades," and "Happiness." Although these films have varying degrees of shortcomings or errors, and the errors in individual films are very serious, they should not be equated with "An Unfinished Comedy." For example, "Seeking Love" is very different from "An Unfinished Comedy." The film "An Unfinished Comedy," as you said, is indeed a thoroughly anti-Party and anti-socialist, and at the same time vulgar and unbearable film. Whether it is the conception of the theme, the design of the characters, the arrangement of the plot, or the various details, it viciously attacks and slanders our new society, distorts our Party's policies, and uglifies our responsible cadres, and it is so vicious that it wants to kill them with one blow. In Lu Ban's eyes, everything about the new society, the new system, the Party's leadership, the Party's policies, etc. is worthless and should be overthrown. The vulgar and decadent things of the bourgeoisie should be restored so that they can rule the world. This is truly an anti-Party and anti-socialist film. However, the film "Seeking Love," although it used satire regardless of the occasion and the characters in order to pursue comedic effects, resulting in mocking many characters who should not have been satirized, and instead being tolerant of the real targets of satire, it made the viewpoints blurred and the rights and wrongs unclear. Such films do reflect the vulgarity of the thoughts and feelings and the low moral character of our creative personnel, and will not produce an educational effect of improving moral character on the audience. However, these are only ideological and artistic shortcomings or errors, and are fundamentally different in nature from "An Unfinished Comedy," which maliciously attacks our Party and society. Therefore, it feels a bit overstated to put this type of film in the same category as "An Unfinished Comedy" and classify them all as anti-Party and anti-socialist works. The result would inevitably confuse errors of various natures and make the errors more serious. Therefore, I think the method you adopted on this issue is inappropriate.
    Secondly, you classify all films that have shortcomings in expressing the Party's leadership, regardless of their circumstances, as "obliterating the Party's leadership, violating the Party's policies, canceling or distorting the images of Party members and leading figures, and distorting the Party's life and style." This also expands the problem, as if so many films have the same serious errors, which is also not appropriate, because the actual situation is not completely like this. In fact, although many films have more or less such shortcomings as you pointed out, these shortcomings do not occupy an important position in those films, nor are they the main trend of those films. The main trend of those films is still correct. Therefore, you seem to have a great deal of one-sidedness on this issue.
    Indeed, films such as "Nurse's Diary," "Mother and Daughter Teachers," "Son of a Herdsman," "Happiness," "Sailing Against the Wind," "Song of the Phoenix," and "The Flute Blows Horizontally," as you pointed out, "all show various characters engaged in struggle, but the authors only focus on expressing their personal struggles, and the support and strength given to them by the Party organization and leadership is expressed very weakly, and even some incorrect styles and erroneous leadership methods are treated as good things, so the images of Party members and leaders embodied on the screen are pale and weak, lack vitality, and are even simple and crude, rigid in style, and unreasonable." This criticism is in line with the facts and is correct. But this only illustrates one aspect of these films, and you have not made due analysis and assessment of another more important aspect, so it seems very incomplete, and as a result, the negative aspects have been expanded.
    For example, the film "Nurse's Diary," despite the fact that it portrays the process of a young intellectual participating in actual struggle and tempering himself in a relatively simple way, thus failing to deeply reflect the changes in the thoughts and feelings of a young student from a petty-bourgeois background in actual tempering, and that the Party and Youth League organizations did not provide enough ideological education and help to the protagonist, Jian Suhua, in all her work experiences, and that there were places where her role was excessively highlighted in certain details in order to show the protagonist's excellent qualities, etc. But in any case, the keynote of this film is upward, and it is basically healthy. As a young student cultivated in a socialist system, in order to respond to the call of the motherland, she would rather leave her lover temporarily, and not be afraid of hardships and difficulties, to engage in construction work in remote places where it is needed, which is precisely the excellent quality we want to praise today. The development of the entire film's plot also reflects the ever-changing atmosphere of our country's socialist construction and the new changes and developments in the relationships between people around them. Therefore, although the film still has its shortcomings and inadequacies, creative personnel should draw experience and learn lessons from it, and further improve in future creations. However, the objective effect of this film is basically good, and it has a certain inspiring power.
    Other films such as "Mother and Daughter Teachers," "Sailing Against the Wind," "Son of a Herdsman," and "Happiness," all have varying degrees of shortcomings, but their main direction is still correct. But you have overlooked a comprehensive and specific analysis of the films in this regard, and you lack a correct distinction between the major and minor issues of the films. Therefore, you say: "A considerable number of films last year had errors that were common and universal. Despite their different forms of expression, the essence is a wavering and betrayal of the direction of art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, all the way to openly waving a white flag to attack the Party and oppose the leadership of the Party." I don't think this conclusion is convincing. As mentioned earlier, at the time when the rightist evil wind was blowing, some creative personnel did lose their direction and waver about their creative path, resulting in serious errors in creation. But in my opinion, for the majority of creative personnel, what you said at the beginning of the article is still correct: mainly "because the vast majority of film artists are bourgeois intellectuals, and their original standpoints have not been completely changed, so their works often express bourgeois thoughts, feelings, and tastes." Except for a very small number of rightists, the vast majority belong to ideological problems, and it cannot be said that they are all political problems. Therefore, it should not be affirmed that they are all consciously "openly waving a white flag to attack the Party and oppose the leadership of the Party." Since most of the films belong to ideological problems, only the conclusion of ideological errors should be drawn, and not the political conclusion of anti-Party and anti-socialism. What do you think?
    Of course, political problems and artistic ideological problems are often closely related and difficult to distinguish. But the two are ultimately different, especially when commenting on film creation in 1957 under the rampant attack of the rightists, it is necessary to carefully and cautiously distinguish which are political attacks and which are ideological errors, and give comments appropriately, so that the relevant creative personnel can receive correct education. Because artistic ideological problems belong to the contradictions among the people, while political problems (anti-Party and anti-socialist problems) belong to the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy.
    Furthermore, regarding the issue of expressing the Party's leadership in films, I think what you said in the article is not clear enough, thus causing misunderstandings. First of all, I want to say that your exposure and criticism of the erroneous thoughts expressed by the directors of "Footsteps of Youth" and "Deep Feelings" in the creative process is accurate and powerful. Some creative personnel believe that the appearance of Party members and Youth League members and responsible Party and Youth League cadres in their works will make the works formulaic and conceptualized, so they intentionally avoid portraying Party members, which is of course completely wrong. But when you talk about whether or not to express Party members in films and whether or not to portray the images of Party members well, the issue is not clear enough. I think it should be separated: for those creators who are unwilling to express the images of Party members in films, the erroneous ideas of why they are unwilling can be pointed out. For those creators who have expressed the images of Party members but have not expressed them appropriately or well, the reasons why they are not expressed appropriately should be analyzed, and their shortcomings should be pointed out truthfully, so that they can draw lessons from it, and more emphasis should be placed on talking from the positive side. What do you think?
    Finally, the term "white flag" is now inappropriate for criticizing artistic thought. What do you think?
    Finally, I want to say once again that the various erroneous ideological tendencies in our 1957 film creation that you pointed out in your article are very worthy of our attention and are of great help to our current work. We will firmly remember the experiences and lessons of 1957. I completely agree with what you pointed out at the end of the article that the reason why such serious errors occurred in the 1957 film creation is that the rightist attack was indeed a major reason, but it is also inseparable from the lack of deep understanding and understanding of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy by those of us who are doing leadership work. This is especially important for those of us who are doing direct organization of creation and production work. As you said, although we have always emphasized the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and emphasized the creation of new heroic figures, we have relaxed the most fundamental point, that is, we have not seriously taken effective measures to help and urge all creative personnel to go deep into life, temper themselves, and transform themselves; on the other hand, we have not relied enough on the leadership of the Party, and political leadership has not been taken, and the phenomenon of separating from politics and neglecting politics is not only very common among creative personnel, but also quite serious among us responsible cadres. In our daily work, we only calculate economic accounts and not political accounts, and political work is not deep or frequent enough, so it is no wonder that when the rightist evil wind blows, we cannot withstand the test at all and are messed up. As far as I am concerned personally, the situation of a fear running through three stages that you pointed out exists. Indeed, at the beginning, we overemphasized the characteristics of film, fearing that letting go would lead to chaos and poisonous weeds; when implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, we did not dare to carry out ideological leadership, fearing that it would hinder "letting a hundred flowers bloom"; and when bad films came out, we did not dare to face up to the errors and were afraid of criticism, which is actually a manifestation of right-leaning thought that does not believe in the truth and does not believe in the masses.
    Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party, the rectification and anti-rightist campaign has turned bad things into good things, and now the situation of creative personnel has greatly changed. In 1958, we resolutely implemented the Party's instructions, and completed forty-eight artistic films, fifty-four fine arts films, and one hundred and thirteen science and education films. Obviously, if the consciousness of the broad masses of creative personnel has not been raised, and without the enthusiasm of the broad masses, it would be impossible to complete this unprecedented production target. What is particularly gratifying is that in the past year, all creative personnel have come into contact with reality, and have begun to realize the great significance of going deep into life. We believe that on the basis of 1958, further strengthening the Party's leadership, taking politics as the lead, continuing to go deep into life, temper ourselves, transform ourselves, and improve artistic cultivation and artistic skills will not only continuously improve our creative level, but also gradually build a film team that is both red and expert. So all in all, the situation is good and the future is optimistic.
    Written in haste, I hope you will correct any improprieties.
          Best regards!

            (II)
 Comrade Wenshu:
    Your letter has been received. I have been quite busy with work recently. At the same time, the opinions you raised are very important and need to be carefully considered, so I did not reply immediately. Please forgive me.
    That article of mine was written in a rush before I went abroad, and I did not have the opportunity to revise it again personally when it was published. When passing through Moscow, I also wrote a letter to the comrades in the literary and art department of the newspaper, asking them to carefully consider it again and distinguish between poisonous weeds and some films with varying degrees of bourgeois ideology and viewpoints, so as to avoid misunderstandings. But the article had already been published by then. Since returning to China this year, I have been busy and have not had time to write an article to correct this shortcoming. This matter itself is a lesson worth learning. This article involves many issues. It would have been better to solicit the opinions of more comrades and revise it more before publishing it.
    I basically agree with your criticisms and opinions on the shortcomings of my article.
    I think the main shortcoming of the article is that while criticizing the erroneous tendencies, it did not carefully distinguish the different degrees of errors, especially the nature of the errors, expressed in various films, and the specific analysis was not enough.
    I personally believe that the creation of film art films in 1957 was indeed serious. A total of forty films were completed this year, of which ten were opera stage documentaries. And among the thirty feature films, six or seven films expressed serious bourgeois ideological viewpoints, and several other films also expressed many errors. That is to say, more than a dozen films have quite serious errors. Of course, the nature and degree are still different. (By the way, many of the films mentioned in my article are not entirely products of 1957. There are also five or six films that are products of 1958. They were only mentioned to illustrate the erroneous tendency. When mentioning certain films, it only explains the commonality of a certain tendency based on a certain error of the film, and it does not think that these films are all poisonous weeds. Since 1957, whether the film industry has published articles or spoken at meetings, only one "Unfinished Comedy" has been publicly declared a poisonous weed. This is known to everyone.) However, these errors, to a certain extent, do have commonality and universality. For example, the phenomena of abusing satire, intentionally avoiding or being unwilling to portray the Party's leadership and the image of Party members, and actually appreciating and promoting the thoughts, viewpoints, and tastes of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. 1957 was the year with the largest artistic production in recent years, but the ideological confusion in artistic creation was also astonishing. Therefore, I think that the errors in film art creation this year are indeed a matter of a tendency, not an individual or accidental phenomenon. I personally feel this deeply and painfully feel the importance of the responsibility. Therefore, the article emphasizes the aspect of erroneous tendencies, but ignores pointing out that while pointing out the erroneous tendencies, it carefully distinguishes the different nature and degree of errors in the films. It only classifies a certain erroneous tendency revealed in the works into one category. It neither first distinguished the nature of the errors from a political perspective, nor could it meticulously judge the degree of the errors.
    For example, the errors of abusing satire, "Seeking Love", "Three Comrades", etc., are obviously different from "An Unfinished Comedy". As a work, of course, we cannot only emphasize the creator's motives. In the end, we still have to evaluate the work from the objective effect. But Lv Ban's blatant and intentional attack on the new society, and the badness of the work, are obviously different from the mistakes formed by certain authors who attempted to reflect the contradictions among the people, but due to their unstable position and unsophisticated expression, abused satirical methods, and pursued vulgar and low-level tastes. This should be strictly distinguished. As you said, they are problems of different natures. However, as a creator, we must also see a fundamental lesson. If the position and thoughts are not changed, it is possible to create anti-Party and anti-socialist works even if it is not conscious. In addition to "An Unfinished Comedy", there was an individual satirical comedy film two years ago that can indeed be said to be almost indistinguishable from "poisonous weeds".
    Naturally, ideological transformation is a long-term process, and the thoughts, viewpoints, and tastes of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will still be expressed frequently. This kind of ideological problem requires long-term, patient, and meticulous work to help creative workers further overcome their weaknesses and move forward in big steps.
    From this point of view, I deeply feel the backwardness of our film theory work. We now need to seriously learn lessons from the errors in the artistic creation of 1957 and explore in a positive way (through specific analysis of the works) issues such as the relationship between reality and Party spirit, satirical comedy, expressing the image of the Party's leadership, and how to portray intellectuals, so that some creators have a correct understanding of these issues and eliminate certain misunderstandings; so that our film creation is more extensive in subject matter and more diverse in style. Precisely for this reason, I think it is very necessary for you to point out these shortcomings in my article. Otherwise, it may have some negative impact among creative personnel.
    But there is one point of view that I still reserve my own opinion. That is, judging from the erroneous tendencies of the films in 1957, there are so many films with errors, and certain errors have commonality and universality (naturally, the nature and degree are different). To summarize, it can be said that "despite the different forms of expression, the essence is a wavering and betrayal of the direction of art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, all the way to openly waving a white flag to attack the Party and oppose the leadership of the Party." I think that from the perspective of the erroneous tendencies and the essence of the thoughts, this view is still acceptable and not excessive. The problem is that there is a big distance between wavering from the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and attacking the Party and opposing the leadership of the Party. What I said is too general and lacks specific analysis of various different situations. At the same time, if I did not use the words "betrayal" and "white flag" and only said that this is a wavering and violation of the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and individual films even reached the point of opposing the Party, it might be more appropriate and more in line with the facts. This is naturally only my personal opinion, and maybe this view is still one-sided. But I still put it forward for your discussion.
    I agree that it is inappropriate to call all films with erroneous thoughts "white flags." When I wrote this article, the concept of "white flag" was unclear. At that time, it generally referred to bourgeois thought. Now it seems that it is very inappropriate to use the term "white flag" to criticize bourgeois thought in creation. Red flags and white flags should refer to two political roads, major issues of right and wrong, and the distinction between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. The phenomenon of literary and artistic creation is complex, and it may be difficult to make a simple judgment based on this.
    Thank you for your many valuable opinions. This is of great benefit to us in better helping and promoting creation, especially in summing up the creation of 1958 well. I also hope that we can often communicate in the future to exchange some views and opinions on creation. If there are any inappropriate views in my reply, please correct me. Best regards!

### 对1957年一些影片的评价问题

专栏：

    对1957年一些影片的评价问题
    袁文殊　陈荒煤
    编者按：下面发表的是袁文殊和陈荒煤两位同志就陈荒煤同志写的“坚决拔掉银幕上的白旗”一文交换意见的来往信件。这篇文章是去年12月2日在本报发表的。我们认为，袁文殊同志提出的意见基本上是正确的。我们对这篇文章的处理也是有缺点的。
            （一）
  荒煤同志：
    听说你已经从国外回来了，近况谅好。
    读了你在去年12月2日“人民日报”上发表的“坚决拔掉银幕上的白旗”一文之后，觉得有些意见很想和你谈谈，但是那时你已远在国外，又想到你一定很忙，所以未便写信相扰。现在虽然事隔二月，但是那些问题觉得仍有商谈的必要，因此特将我个人的看法提出来，请你指正。
    首先，我觉得你这篇文章在对1957年我国电影艺术创作中所取得的成就作了肯定之后，对一部分影片中所表现的形形色色的资产阶级思想进行批判是十分必要的，其中许多意见也极可宝贵。回想1956年冬至1957年春夏之间，在右派进攻和修正主义思想影响之下，整个电影战线被弄得乌烟瘴气，邪说纷纭，许多创作人员迷失了方向。因此产生了一些有错误思想和歪曲了生活真实的影片，这确是一个沉痛的经验教训。诚如你所指出的，“由于电影艺术创作者绝大部分都是资产阶级知识分子，他们原来的立场观点还没有彻底改变，因此，在他们的作品里，时常表现出资产阶级的思想感情和趣味。几年来，在党的领导下，电影界对一些具有严重错误思想的影片进行了批判，使广大电影创作人员受到了教育。……不过问题并没有得到彻底解决，那个灵魂深处的资产阶级王国并没有完全摧毁，在国内外修正主义思想影响下，这些渣滓又浮了上来。”这个分析是完全正确的。
    幸好在党的领导下，经过一场剧烈的整风反右斗争之后，电影战线上的上述情况才改变过来，党的领导巩固了，电影事业的方针端正了，资产阶级右派分子孤立了。在大破形形色色资产阶级艺术观点的基础上，电影工作者的思想觉悟也有不同程度的提高，从而给1958年的电影事业大跃进创造了条件。可以这样说，如果没有1957年的整风，1958年的大跃进是不可能的。事实摆在眼前，1958年的影片产量比1957年增加了两倍还不止，创作人员开始和群众接触了，创作人员的精神面貌也大大改观了。当然电影战线上的无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想之间的斗争是长期的，为了更好的接受这个经验教训，使所有创作人员都有一个明确的认识，从而加紧自己的思想改造，提高电影创作水平，对过去影片中的缺点和错误进行认真的分析批判是完全必要的。所以你在这篇文章中所指出的许多问题对我们今后的工作是有积极的意义的。
    但是，当我读完文章，除了得到上述的教益之外，也还感到有些不满足和看法上不完全一致的地方，所以我现在愿意提出来和你商讨。
    首先，我觉得你从影片样式上来区分问题，把喜剧影片归到一类来进行批判，就势必把许多错误性质不同，或只有一些缺点的喜剧影片都混淆在一起了，这是不恰当的。你在“滥用讽刺，借口‘反映真实’、‘干预生活’，直接攻击党和新社会，反对党的领导”的小标题下面，批评了“未完成的喜剧”和“谁是被抛弃的人”、“寻爱记”、“球场风波”、“三个战友”、“幸福”等等许多影片。这些片子虽有各种不同程度的缺点或错误，个别片子错误还很严重，但不应把他们一律和“未完成的喜剧”相提并论。比如“寻爱记”和“未完成的喜剧”就有极大的不同。影片“未完成的喜剧”，的确如你所说的，是一部彻头彻尾反党反社会主义的、同时又是庸俗不堪的影片，它不论是主题的构思，人物的设计，情节的安排以及种种细节描写都恶毒地在攻击和诽谤我们的新社会，歪曲我们党的政策和丑化我们的负责干部，而且狠毒到要一棍子打死的程度。在吕班的眼里，一切新社会、新制度、党的领导、党的政策等等都一无是处，应该打倒。应该让资产阶级的庸俗腐朽的东西复辟，让他们来坐天下。这是实实在在的一部反党反社会主义的影片。但是影片“寻爱记”，则虽然为了追求喜剧效果，不顾场合，不看人物乱用了讽刺，结果对不该讽刺的人物给了许多嘲讽，而对真正要讽刺的对象却反而加以宽容，这就弄得观点模糊，是非不清。这样的影片的确反映了我们创作人员的思想感情的庸俗和情操的低下，对观众不会产生提高道德品质的教育作用。但这些只是思想上艺术上的缺点或错误，同恶意攻击我们的党和社会的“未完成的喜剧”是有根本性质的区别的。因此，把这类影片和“未完成的喜剧”划在一道，都归之为反党反社会主义的作品就感到话有点说过了头了。其结果就势必把各种不同性质的错误混淆起来，把错误严重化。所以我以为你在这个问题上所采取的方法是不恰当的。
    其次，你把所有在表现党的领导上存在着缺点的影片，不论其情况如何，都一概划为“抹煞党的领导，违反党的政策，取消或歪曲党员及领导人物的形象，歪曲党的生活和作风”，这也把问题扩大化了，好像那么多影片都存在着同样严重的错误似的，这也不够恰当，因为实际情况并不是完全如此。实际上是，有许多影片虽然或多或少的存在着像你所指出的那类缺点，但是这些缺点在那些影片中并不占重要地位，更不是那些影片的主要倾向，那些影片的主要倾向还是正确的。因此你在这个问题上就显得有很大的片面性。
    不错，像影片“护士日记”、“母女教师”、
  “牧人之子”、“幸福”、“乘风破浪”、“凤凰之歌”和“洞箫横吹”等等，诚如你所指出的，是“都可以看到各种各样的人物在进行斗争，可是，作者只着重表现了他们个人的斗争，对党的组织和领导所给予他们的支持和力量，却表现得非常微弱，甚至把一些不正确的作风和错误的领导方法，也当作好的东西来表现，因而，体现在银幕上的党员和领导人员的形象，就苍白无力，缺乏生气，甚至简单粗暴，作风生硬，不近情理。”这种批评是合乎事实的，是正确的。但是这只能说明这些影片的一个侧面，还有另外的更主要的一个侧面你没有进行应有的分析和估计，因此，就显得很不全面，结果就把消极面扩大了。
    例如，像“护士日记”那样的影片，尽管它把一个青年知识分子参加实际斗争锻炼的过程写得比较简单，从而不能深刻地反映一个小资产阶级出身的青年学生在实际锻炼中的思想感情的变化过程，在主人公简素华参加工作的全部经历中，党、团组织对她思想上的教育和帮助也还写得不够，而为了显示主人公的优秀品质，在某些细节描写上也有过分突出她的作用的地方，等等。但是无论如何，这部影片的基调是向上的，基本上是健康的，作为一个社会主义制度中培养出来的青年学生，为了响应祖国的号召，宁愿暂时离开爱人，不怕艰难困苦，到工作需要的遥远的地方去从事建设事业，这正是我们今天所要表扬的优秀品质。在全部影片情节的发展过程中也反映了我国社会主义建设日新又新的气象和周围的人与人之间的关系的新的变化和发展。所以，虽然影片还有它的缺点和不足之处，从创作人员来说，应该汲取经验，引为教训，在今后的创作中进一步提高，但是，这部影片的客观效果，基本上是好的，有一定的鼓舞人的力量的。
    其它如“母女教师”、“乘风破浪”、“牧人之子”和“幸福”等等，虽然都存在着各种不同程度的缺点，但是它的主要方向还是正确的。而你在这方面却忽略了对影片的全面的具体的分析，对影片的主要问题和次要问题也缺少正确的辨别，因此而说：“去年有相当数量的影片，其错误是带有普遍性和共同性的。尽管表现形态各不相同，实质上就是对文艺为工农兵方向的动摇和叛变，一直到公开摇着白旗向党进攻，反对党的领导。”我觉得这个结论是不能令人信服的。正如在前面说过的，在右派妖风刮来的当时，的确有一部分创作人员迷失了方向，对自己的创作道路发生动摇，从而造
  成创作上的严重错误，但是依我看来，对大多数创作人员来说，还是你在文章开头时候说的对，主要是“由于电影艺术创作者绝大部分都是资产阶级知识分子，他们原来的立场观点还没有彻底改变，因此，在他们的作品里，时常表现出资产阶级的思想感情和趣味”罢了。除了极少数的右派分子外，绝大部分是属于思想问题，不能说都是政治问题，因此也就不应该肯定他们都是有意识的“公开摇着白旗向党进攻，反对党的领导”。既然大多数影片是属于思想问题，就只能得出思想错误的结论，而不应该得出反党反社会主义的政治性的结论，你说是不是呢？
    当然，政治问题和艺术思想问题往往是关系密切，难于区分的。但是两者究竟有所不同，特别是评论到1957年在右派猖狂进攻下的电影创作的时候，更需要仔细而谨慎地加以区别，哪些是政治性的进攻，哪些是思想上的错误，恰如其分的给予评论，才能使有关创作人员得到正确的教育。因为艺术思想问题是属于人民内部的矛盾问题，而政治问题（反党反社会主义的问题）则是属于敌我矛盾的问题了。
    再次是，关于在影片中表现党的领导的问题，我觉得你在文章中也说得不够清楚，因此有使人产生误解的地方。首先我要说，你对于
  “青春的脚步”和“情长谊深”的导演们在创作过程中表现的错误思想进行揭露、批判是准确的而且是有力的。有些创作人员认为作品中出现了党团员和党团负责干部，就会使作品公式化概念化，因而有意回避描写党团员，这当然是完全错误的。但是当你说到在影片中表现不表现党员和能不能表现好党员的形象的时候，问题就说得不够清楚了。我以为应该把它分开来说：对那些不愿意在影片中表现党团员形象的创作者，可以指出他们为什么不愿意的错误想法，对那些表现了党团员形象而表现得不够恰当、不好的创作者，应该分析他们为什么表现不恰当的原因，实事求是的把他们的缺点指出来，使他们引为教训，更多的从正面来谈会更贴切一些，不知道你以为怎样？
    最后，把“白旗”这个名词用来批判艺术思想，现在看来并不妥当，你的看法如何？
    末了，我还要说一遍，你的文章所指出的我们1957年电影创作中的各种错误思想倾向是很值得我们重视的，对我们当前的工作有很大的帮助，我们将牢牢的记住这1957年的经验教训。我完全同意你在文章的最后所指出的，1957年的电影创作之所以产生如此严重的错误，右派进攻固然是一个主要原因，但是它和我们做领导工作的人员对党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针缺乏深刻的认识和理解也是分不开的。这对于在做直接组织创作和制片工作的我们，责任尤其重大。正如你所说的，尽管我们一直强调工农兵方向，强调要创造新英雄人物，但是却放松了最根本的一条，就是没有认真采取有效措施帮助和督促所有的创作人员深入生活，锻炼改造；另一方面就是依靠党的领导不够，政治没有挂帅，脱离政治轻视政治的现象不但在创作人员中间十分普遍，在我们这些负责干部中间也相当严重，在日常工作中只算经济账，不算政治账，政治工作极不深入也不经常，这样就难怪当右派的妖风刮来的时候，完全经不住考验而被弄得乌烟瘴气了。拿我个人来说，你所指出的一个怕字贯串三个阶段的情况都存在着，的确，开始时候过多的强调电影的特性，怕放手之后会乱，会放出毒草来；到了贯彻百花齐放的方针的时候又不敢进行思想领导，怕妨碍“百花齐放”；到出了坏影片的时候又不敢正视错误，害怕批评，这实际是一种不相信真理，不相信群众的右倾思想的表现。
    由于党的英明领导，经过整风反右之后，把坏事变为好事，现在创作人员的情况已大为改观了。1958年，我们坚决贯彻了党的指示，光是艺术片就完成了四十八部，美术片五十四本，科教片一百一十三部。显然，如果广大创作人员的觉悟程度没有提高，没有广大群众的积极性，要完成这个空前的生产指标是不可能的。特别值得高兴的是，过去的一年间，所有的创作人员都接触了实际，并且已经开始体会到深入生活的重大意义了。我们相信，在1958年的基础上进一步的加强党的领导，政治挂帅，继续深入生活，锻炼改造，提高艺术修养和艺术技巧，就不但可以不断提高我们的创作水平，而且将逐步建成一支又红又专的电影队伍。所以整个说来，情况是良好的，前途是乐观的。

            （二）文殊同志：
    来信收到。最近工作较忙，同时，你所提出的意见很重要，需要仔细地考虑一下，所以没有立即回信，请你原谅。
    我那篇文章是在去年出国之前赶写出来的，写得比较匆忙，发表的时候也没有机会亲自再修改一遍。经过莫斯科时，我还曾经写过信给报社文艺部的同志，请他们再仔细斟酌一下，把毒草和一些具有不同程度的资产阶级思想和观点的影片区别开来，以免发生误会。可是那时候文章已经发表了。今年回国来因为忙，又没有及时写文章纠正这个缺点。这件事情的本身，就是很值得汲取的教训。这篇文章涉及到许多问题，如果事先多征求一些同志的意见，多修改一下再发表就好了。
    我基本上同意你对我的这篇文章存在的缺点所提出的批评和意见。
    我觉得文章最主要的缺点，是在批判错误倾向的同时，对各种影片中所表现的程度不同的错误、特别是错误的性质，没有仔细地加以区别，具体的分析很不够。
    我个人认为：1957年电影艺术片的创作情况，确实是严重的。这一年一共完成了四十部影片，其中有十部是戏曲舞台纪录片。而三十部故事片中，有六、七部影片表现了严重的资产阶级的思想观点，还有好几部影片也表现了很多错误。这就是说，有十几部影片有相当严重的错误。当然，其性质与程度也还是有所不同的。（附带说明一下，我文章中所提到的许多部影片，不完全是1957年的产品，还有五、六部影片是1958年的产品，只是为了说明错误的倾向而提到它。提到某些影片时，也只就其某一点错误而说明某一种倾向的共同性，也并不认为这些影片都是毒草。从1957年以来，电影界无论发表文章也好，在会议中发言也好，公开宣布了毒草的还只是一部“未完成的喜剧”。这是大家都知道的。）但是，这些错误，在某种程度上说，确实带有普遍性和共同性。比如，滥用讽刺，有意回避或不愿去描写党的领导和党员形象，以及实际欣赏和宣扬资产阶级与小资产阶级的思想、观点和趣味等等现象。1957年是我们近几年艺术生产量最多的一年，然而艺术创作中思想上的混乱却也是惊人的。所以，我认为，这一年电影艺术创作中的错误确是一种带倾向性的问题，不是一种个别、偶然的现象。这一点，我个人感触很深，痛感到责任的重大，因此，写文章就强调了错误的倾向这一方面，而忽视了指出错误倾向的同时，仔细区别影片中错误的不同的性质和程度上的区别，只就作品中所流露的某一种错误倾向而归于一类，既没有首先从政治上来区别错误的性质，也没有能细致地判断错误的程度了。
    例如，滥用讽刺这一类的错误，“寻爱记”、
  “三个战友”等，显然和“未完成的喜剧”有所不同。作为作品来看，当然不能只强调创作者的动机，最后还是要从客观效果来评价作品，但如吕班那种明目张胆、有意攻击新社会，以及作品之坏，显然和某些作者企图反映人民内部矛盾，但由于立场不稳，表现不深刻，滥用讽刺手段，追求庸俗低级趣味的效果而形成某些错误是不相同的，这是应该严格区别开来的。正如你所说的是不同性质的问题。但是，作为一个创作者来讲，也要看到一个根本的教训，立场思想不改变，尽管不是有意识地却也可能创作出反党、反社会主义的作品来。除了“未完成的喜剧”外，前年有个别的讽刺喜剧片，也确实可以说是和“毒草”相差无几了。
    自然，思想改造是长期的，资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想、观点和趣味还是要经常表现出来的，这种思想问题需要长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，才能帮助创作工作者进一步克服弱点，大步前进。
    从这一点来讲，我深深感到我们电影理论工作的落后。我们现在很需要认真地从1957年艺术创作的错误中去吸取教训，正面地去探讨一下（通过作品的具体分析）真实与党性、讽刺喜剧、表现党的领导形象、如何描写知识分子等等问题，使得有些创作者对这些问题具有正确的认识，消除某些误解；使得我们的电影创作在题材上更广泛，在样式上更多样。正是如此，我觉得，你指出我文章中的这些缺点，是十分必要的。不然，它很可能在创作人员中间产生一些消极的影响。
    但是有一点意见我还保留自己的看法。那就是，从1957年影片的错误的倾向来看，有错误的影片这样多，某些错误又带有共同性与普遍性（自然，性质与程度有所不同），概括起来讲，说是“尽管表现形态各不相同，实质上就是对文艺为工农兵方向的动摇和叛变，一直到公开摇着白旗向党进攻，反对党的领导。”我觉得，从错误的倾向和思想的实质上来看，这个看法还是可以的，是不过分的。问题是从对工农兵方向动摇到向党进攻，反对党的领导，这中间还有很大距离，我说的太笼统，缺乏对各种不同情况的具体分析。同时如果我不用“叛变”、“白旗”这些字眼，而只说这是对工农兵方向的动摇和违背，个别影片竟达到了反党的地步，这样也许更恰当，更符合事实一些。这自然只是我个人的看法，也许这个看法还有片面性。但仍提出来和你商讨。
    我同意，把许多有错误思想的影片一律叫作“白旗”，是不恰当的。我在写这篇文章的时候，对“白旗”这个概念是不明确的，当时，是一般地指资产阶级的思想。现在看来，用“白旗”这个名词来批判创作中的资产阶级的思想是很不恰当的。红旗和白旗应该是指政治上的两条道路、大是大非、香花与毒草的区别。而文学艺术创作现象是复杂的，恐怕很难以此作简单的判断。
    谢谢你提出的许多宝贵的意见。这对我们更好地帮助、推动创作，特别是很好地总结1958年的创作，有很大好处。也希望今后能经常通讯来交换一些创作上的看法和意见。我复信中如有不妥当的看法，还请你指正。敬礼！
