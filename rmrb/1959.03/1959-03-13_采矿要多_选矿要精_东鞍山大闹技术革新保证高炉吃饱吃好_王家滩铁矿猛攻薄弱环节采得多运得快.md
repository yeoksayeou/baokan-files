East Anshan Iron Mine Carries Out Technical Innovation to Ensure High Furnace Output

    This newspaper reports that workers at Anshan Iron and Steel's Dong Anshan Iron Mine boldly broke superstitions and launched three technical revolution campaigns, breaking through the main key to production - reducing the moisture content of concentrate powder, and then set off a new technical revolution upsurge throughout the mine.

    The newly built flotation workshop in Dong Anshan Iron Mine is not only large in scale, but also has the latest technical equipment. However, after being put into production in October last year, the concentrate powder dehydrated by the filter press was always like a slurry, with excessive moisture content, which made it difficult to sinter and could not be used by Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnace. As a result, the filtering process was like a bone stuck in the throat of the entire mine's production. The downstream sintering machine could not get enough to eat, and the ore mined upstream was piling up, seriously threatening production.

    In order to change this situation, from the end of last year, the mine's Party committee issued a combat call to the workers to "concentrate fire and break through the technical barrier of the filter press", and launched three consecutive campaigns. Before breaking through the technical barrier, the workers first carried out a great debate to break the erroneous ideas of blindly worshipping foreign countries and books, such as "non-ferrous metals can be floated, but ferrous metals are difficult to float", which greatly encouraged the workers' confidence in overcoming the technical barrier. After appropriately adjusting the chemical agents, the situation improved, but the problem was not completely solved. At this time, the Party committee pointed out that it is not enough to rely solely on machines and agents, but more importantly, to rely on the workers to master these new machines. As a result, the masses put forward more than 3,000 rationalization proposals and created many indigenous methods. For example, worker Zhang Zhimin used the method of adding clear water to adjust the concentration of the slurry, and the dehydration effect was very good. Worker Qi Youchun paid attention to repairing the filter cloth at any time, reducing machine leakage and improving water blowing capacity. The wisdom and practical experience of the masses were concentrated, and after scientific analysis, the law of controlling the moisture content of concentrate powder was found and summarized into six new operating procedures. Since then, the technical barrier of the filter press has been completely broken through, so that the moisture content of the concentrate powder has dropped from 17 or 18 percent to about 12 percent, and the iron grade of the concentrate powder has also increased accordingly to 64 percent. At this point, the quality barrier was broken through, and the output also increased accordingly.

Wangjiatan Iron Mine Vigorously Attacks Weak Links to Mine More and Transport Faster

    This newspaper reports that workers at the Wangjiatan Iron Mine of Kunming Iron and Steel Works have set off a technical innovation upsurge centered on mining more and transporting ore faster, which has greatly improved work efficiency and greatly reduced the labor intensity of workers.

    Wangjiatan Iron Mine's mining task this year has increased by one and a half times compared with last year. In the case of insufficient equipment and labor, the mine's Party general branch mobilized the masses through large and small meetings, calling on workers to use their brains and think of ways to carry out technical innovations to ensure the completion of this year's mining tasks and meet the needs of blast furnace ironmaking. The workers responded to the call and immediately took action. Li Shunman, a worker at the Majiafen mining area open-pit mining site, used the T-shaped hole layout method for blasting instead of the previous I-shaped hole layout method, which increased the amount of ore blasted down by 50 times compared to the past. In order to overcome the weak link of ore loading work, the workers proposed the method of using chutes to load ore. Zhao Baoshan, a worker in the Xiejiaying mining area, and Jiang Tingwen, a safety officer, installed three ore chutes using old wood. In the past, it took thirty workers half an hour to load a car of ore, but now it only takes five or six minutes to load a car once the car arrives and the chute door is opened. After the workers in the Majiafen open-pit mining site innovated the car loading technology, the efficiency of loading ore was increased by five or six times, and the labor intensity of the workers was greatly reduced. The workers of the vertical shaft team and the Dakuangqing mining area, in the case of a lack of equipment and most of them being new workers, were determined to carry out technical innovations to speed up the construction. The vertical shaft team lacked a hoist during construction, so the workers manufactured their own wooden hand-cranked hoist for hoisting. The Dakuangqing mining area adopted the parallel operation method of drilling holes and removing slag at the same time, which accelerated the progress of the project. Because groundwater wet the detonators and caused "duds," the workers coated the detonators with oil to prevent moisture, eliminating "duds" and ensuring that the plan was overfulfilled every month.

    采矿要多　选矿要精
    东鞍山大闹技术革新保证高炉吃饱吃好
    王家滩铁矿猛攻薄弱环节采得多运得快
    本报讯　鞍钢东鞍山铁矿职工大胆破除迷信，发起三次技术革命战役，突破了生产主要关键——降低精矿粉含水量，进而在全矿掀起了新的技术革命热潮。
    东鞍山铁矿新建浮选车间，不仅规模大，而且技术装备是最新的。但是去年10月投入生产后，经过过滤机脱水的精矿粉总是像稀泥，含水量过大，难于烧结，鞍钢高炉不能使用。于是过滤工序像一根骨刺一样卡住了全矿生产的咽喉，下道工序烧结机吃不饱，上道工序采下的矿石又积压起来，严重地威胁着生产。
    为了改变这种状况，从去年年末，矿党委就向职工发出了“集中火力，突破过滤机技术关”的战斗号召，连续发起三次战役。在突破技术关以前，首先通过职工大鸣大放大辩论，破除了有些人认为“有色金属可以浮选，黑色金属很难浮选”等等迷信外国、迷信书本的错误思想，大大鼓舞了职工攻破技术关的信心。经过适当的调整化学药剂，情况虽有好转，但仍未彻底解决问题。这时，党委指出，不能光靠机器和药剂，更重要的是依靠工人群众掌握这些新机器。于是群众又提出了三千多条合理化建议，并创造了许多土办法。例如工人张志民利用加清水的办法调节矿浆浓度，脱水效果很好。工人祁有春随时注意缝补过滤布，减少了机器漏气，提高了吹水能力。群众的智慧和实际操作经验集中起来，经过科学分析，找到了控制精矿粉含水量的规律，归纳成六条新的操作规程。从此，过滤机技术关全线突破，使精矿粉的含水量由百分之十七、八，下降到12％左右，精矿粉的含铁品位也相应提高到64％。至此，质量关被突破，产量也随之上升。
    本报讯　昆明钢铁厂王家滩铁矿工人，掀起了以多采矿、快运矿为中心的技术革新热潮，使工效大大提高，工人劳动的强度也有很大减轻。
    王家滩铁矿今年的采矿任务比去年增加一倍半。在设备和劳动力不足的情况下，矿党总支通过大会小会发动群众，号召职工动脑筋、想办法，大搞技术革新，保证完成今年的采矿任务，满足高炉炼铁的需要。职工响应号召，立即行动起来。马家坟工区露天采矿场工人李顺满采用丁字形布眼法打眼放炮，代替过去的一字形布眼法，使矿石炸落比过去提高了五十倍。为了克服装矿工作这一薄弱环节，工人们提出采用溜槽装矿的办法。谢家箐工区工人赵保山和安全员姜庭文利用旧木料安装了三个溜矿槽，过去三十个工人半小时才能装一车矿石，现在只要车子一到，把槽门一开，五、六分钟就能装完一车。马家坟露天采矿场工人革新了装车技术后，装矿石工效提高了五、六倍，并大大的减轻了工人的劳动强度。竖井队和打矿箐工区的工人们，在设备缺乏、而且大部分是新工人的情况下，决心大搞技术革新来加快基建速度。竖井队在施工中缺乏卷扬机，工人们就自己制造了木制手摇卷扬机进行提升。打矿箐工区采用边打眼边出碴的平行作业法，加快了工程进度。因为地下水浸湿雷管造成“瞎炮”，工人们就在雷管外面涂上油来防潮，消灭了“瞎炮”，保证了月月超额完成计划。（附图片）
