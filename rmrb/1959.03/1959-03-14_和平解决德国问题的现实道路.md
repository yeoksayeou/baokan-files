Realistic Path to Peaceful Resolution of the German Question

Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, concluded his visit to the German Democratic Republic on March 12 and issued a joint communiqué. During the visit, Comrade Khrushchev held talks with the leaders of the German Democratic Republic and exchanged views on major issues in the current international situation, particularly the German question. In the joint communiqué, both sides reiterated their positions on the German question, once again demonstrating their desire for a peaceful resolution.

Recently, the German question has become the focus of attention for countries around the world. Whether and how the German question is resolved not only affects the immediate interests of the German people but also the security of European countries and the future of world peace.

The key to a peaceful resolution of the German question is the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Because in the current situation, with the historical reality of the co-existence of two German states, it is impossible to use any mechanical method to first achieve German reunification and then conclude a peace treaty. Only by first concluding a peace treaty with Germany can obstacles be cleared and prerequisites created for the peaceful reunification of Germany. With the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the occupation regime in West Berlin must also be eliminated, and the tense situation in Europe will be greatly eased, which will help to further resolve the issue of European collective security and make the peace in this important region of the world truly stable.

The communiqué of Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the German Democratic Republic pointed out that under the current conditions, a peace treaty with Germany can be signed by the two German states, or, once a German confederation is established, it can be signed in the name of the confederation. The establishment of a confederation would open a shortcut to the restoration of German unity. On the issue of eliminating the occupation status of West Berlin, in order to facilitate the reaching of a consensus among all parties, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to participate in the work of the four major powers in guaranteeing the independent status of West Berlin as a free city and ensuring non-interference in its internal affairs, and agreed that the United Nations should participate in this guarantee. If the Western countries are willing to conduct negotiations in a truly rational manner, Comrade Khrushchev also stated that the Soviet Union could consider appropriately postponing the deadline for the transfer of management rights over the transportation lines from West Germany to West Berlin. On the part of the German Democratic Republic, it also expressed its willingness to grant and guarantee West Berlin, within its own territory, the status of a demilitarized free city and to guarantee the unhindered connection of the free city of West Berlin with the external world, both East and West. This attitude once again clearly demonstrates that the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic do not want to take unilateral actions, but hope to seek a reasonable solution to the problem through the cooperation of all parties. This attitude of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has been welcomed and supported by the entire German people and peace-loving people around the world.

However, the powerful groups headed by U.S. imperialism are still trying their best to obstruct and delay the peaceful resolution of the German question. They are unwilling to give up their occupation status in West Berlin, which has long lost its moral and legal basis, and attempt to maintain this "cold war" base; nor are they willing to end the situation without a peace treaty with Germany, in order to create tensions in Europe at any time. The Western countries are now unable to openly refuse to hold talks with the Soviet Union, but there are reports that they also want to create obstacles to the talks by increasing the number of participants, expanding the agenda, and extending the time. They are plotting to make the upcoming East-West talks fall into endless disputes over trivial issues from the very beginning, in order to delay the resolution of substantive issues. Many members of the U.S. Congress are spreading pessimistic air about the negotiations, saying that accepting the Soviet proposal is tantamount to "shameful surrender." The U.S. Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Army are openly conducting armed intimidation, clamoring to prepare for "emergencies" and "imaginable situations" arising from the so-called "Berlin crisis." Even U.S. President Eisenhower himself has repeatedly come forward to declare that the United States will "not budge an inch" on the West Berlin issue. At a press conference on March 11, he even blatantly carried out nuclear war blackmail. With the support of the United States, the West German government has also adopted a more stubborn attitude. The Adenauer group has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the proposals on making West Berlin a free city, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and all other proposals conducive to easing tensions in Europe. They are even still fantasizing about achieving German reunification by annexing the German Democratic Republic. This policy of the U.S. and West German governments has become the main obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the German question and may lead the German situation to dangerous consequences. Therefore, in the joint communiqué of Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet and German governments resolutely condemned this policy of the Western countries and the West German Adenauer government, and solemnly declared that the Western countries and West Germany must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this policy.

It should be pointed out that the policy of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, which attempts to continue to maintain the division of Germany and the occupation status of West Berlin, is fundamentally unworkable. No matter what excuses they attempt to use to delay or sabotage the upcoming East-West conference, they cannot shirk the responsibility for obstructing the peaceful resolution of the German question. Now the people of the world have been able to see through the fog of Western propaganda and see more clearly the Soviet Union's desire for peace. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany through negotiations and resolving the Berlin issue has become a universal demand of the broad masses of the people. In the face of this powerful force, the U.S. policy toward Germany today has fallen into a state of "utter chaos." The "Washington Post" wrote in commenting on this policy: "If it weren't so bad, it should be said to be ridiculous." Regarding the strategy of how to get out of the current predicament, differences have emerged among Western countries. After British Prime Minister Macmillan visited the Soviet Union, he rushed between London, Paris, and Bonn, and also went to Washington to hold talks with Eisenhower, according to British newspapers, in order to coordinate these contradictions between Western countries. However, the political climate that Macmillan encountered was both hot and cold, and he also incurred cold wind from Washington.

A peace treaty with Germany must be concluded, and the occupation regime in West Berlin must be ended. After the complete bankruptcy of the policy of strength, the way out for the Western countries is to honestly sit down and negotiate. Only peaceful negotiations are the realistic way to resolve the German question and all other outstanding international issues.

### 和平解决德国问题的现实道路

    和平解决德国问题的现实道路
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志，已于3月12日结束了对德意志民主共和国的访问，并发表了访问公报。在访问中，赫鲁晓夫同志曾和德意志民主共和国的领导人进行了会谈，就当前国际局势中的重大问题，特别是德国问题交换了意见。在访问公报中，双方重申了在德国问题上的主张，再一次表现了和平解决德国问题的愿望。
    最近一个时期以来，德国问题一直成为世界各国注意的焦点。德国问题的解决与否和如何解决，不仅关系到德国人民的切身利益，而且也关系到欧洲各国的安全和世界和平的前途。
    和平解决德国问题的关键就是缔结对德和约。因为在战后历史发展所已形成的两个德国同时并存的现实情况下，不可能用任何机械的办法来先实现德国的统一而后缔结对德和约，而只有先缔结对德和约才能为德国的和平统一扫除障碍创造前提。随着对德和约的缔结，西柏林的占领制度也要消除，欧洲的紧张局势将会大大地缓和下来，从而有助于进一步解决欧洲的集体安全问题，使世界这一重要地区的和平得到真正的稳定。
    赫鲁晓夫同志访问德意志民主共和国的公报中指出，在目前条件下，对德和约可由两个德国来签署，如一旦成立了德意志邦联，也可以用邦联的名义来签署。而邦联的成立则会为德国统一的恢复开辟一条捷径。在消除西柏林的占领状态的问题上，为了便于使各方面取得一致的协议，苏联表示愿意参加四大国保障西柏林自由城市的独立地位及其内政不受干涉的工作，并同意由联合国来参加这种保证。如果西方国家愿意真正理智地进行谈判，赫鲁晓夫同志还曾表示过苏联可以考虑把从西德到西柏林的交通线管理权的移交限期作适当的推延。在德意志民主共和国这方面，也表示愿意赋予和保证在它自己领土上的西柏林以非军事化自由城市的地位，并保障西柏林自由城市和东西方外部世界的无阻碍的联系。这种态度，再一次清楚地表现了苏联和德意志民主共和国并不想采取单方面的行动，而希望通过各方面的协力合作来谋求问题的合理解决。苏联和德意志民主共和国的这种态度，得到了全体德国人民和爱好和平的世界各国人民的欢迎和支持。
    但是，以美国帝国主义为首的有势力集团现在仍然想竭力阻挠和拖延德国问题的和平解决。它们不愿放弃自己在西柏林的早已失去了道义和法律根据的占领地位，力图保持这一个“冷战”基地；也不愿结束没有对德和约的局面，以便随时制造欧洲紧张局势。西方国家现在已无法公然拒绝同苏联举行会谈，但是有消息表明它们还想用增加会议成员、扩大议程和延长时间的办法来为会谈制造障碍。它们阴谋使将来举行的东西方会谈一开始就陷于枝节问题的无休止的争论，以便拖延实质问题的解决。美国的许多议员正在对谈判放出悲观空气，说什么接受苏联建议等于是“可耻的投降”。美国的国防部长和陆军部长则公开进行武力恫吓，叫嚣要准备应付“紧急状态”和由于所谓“柏林危机”而产生的“可以想像的局势”。就连美国总统艾森豪威尔本人也为此一再出面表示，美国要在西柏林问题上“寸步不让”。在3月11日举行的记者招待会上，他甚至露骨地进行了核战争的讹诈。在美国的支持下，西德政府也采取了更加顽固不化的态度。阿登纳集团一再表示反对关于使西柏林成为自由城市、缔结对德和约和其他一切有利于缓和欧洲紧张局势的建议。它们甚至还在妄想以吞并德意志民主共和国的方式来实现德国的统一。美国和西德政府的这种政策，已成为阻挠德国问题和平解决的主要障碍，并且有把德国局势导向危险后果的可能。因此，在赫鲁晓夫同志访问德意志民主共和国的公报中，苏德两国政府坚决谴责了西方国家和西德阿登纳政府的这种政策，并且严正声明，西方国家和西德必须对这种政策所产生的后果负完全的责任。
    应该指出，以美国为首的帝国主义集团企图继续坚持分裂德国和保持西柏林占领状态的政策是根本行不通的。不管它们企图采取什么借口来拖延或破坏将要举行的东西方会议，它们无论如何也推卸不了阻挠和平解决德国问题的责任。现在全世界人民已经能够透过西方宣传的迷雾，更加看清楚苏联的和平愿望。通过谈判缔结对德和约，解决柏林问题已经成为广大人民普遍的要求。在这一强大力量面前，美国的对德政策今天已陷于“混乱之至”的状态中了。“华盛顿邮报”在评论这个政策时写道：“如果它不是那么糟糕的话，也应该说是可笑的”。在如何摆脱目前这种困境的策略上，西方各国之间出现了分歧。英国首相麦克米伦访问苏联以后，又急急忙忙奔波于伦敦——巴黎——波恩之间，还要去华盛顿同艾森豪威尔进行会谈据英国报纸透露，为的是协调西方各国之间的这种矛盾。但是，麦克米伦所碰到的政治气候却有冷有热，而且也招致了来自华盛顿的冷风。
    对德和约必须缔结，西柏林的占领制度必须结束。在实力政策彻底破产以后，西方国家的出路就是老老实实地坐下来进行谈判。只有和平谈判，才是解决德国问题以及其他一切悬而未决的国际问题的现实的办法。
