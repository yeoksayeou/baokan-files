    On "Integration"
    Cheng Pu
    The socialist cause is becoming more prosperous day by day, and our work is becoming more and more numerous. If we were to do so many tasks individually and in isolation, it would be difficult to do them all well. So people have found a good working method, which is to combine various tasks that have certain connections with each other. Taking rural work as an example, the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is not an isolated development of each, but a combination of the five major sectors of the agricultural economy. Within the "five industries," each sector has many tasks, and these tasks also need to be combined. We often hear various places propose so-called "two integrations," "three integrations," "five integrations," and even more "integrations" in their actual work. When work is well integrated, it becomes much easier to do.
    Everything has its principal contradiction and numerous secondary contradictions; the principal contradiction and the secondary contradictions are closely related. Every period has the most important and decisive central tasks, but many tasks outside the center are also inseparable from the central tasks. By adopting the method of several "integrations," we can comprehensively grasp other tasks while concentrating our main force on fiercely attacking the central tasks. In this way, the central tasks are highlighted and move forward by leaps and bounds, and other tasks also move forward around the central tasks. This is exactly what is meant by "when the main rope is lifted, the net opens." For example, many regions have implemented many "integrations" in accumulating and producing fertilizer, such as integrating accumulating and producing fertilizer with preparing for plowing, with transporting and applying fertilizer, with field management of summer crops, with developing animal husbandry and sideline production, and with the health movement, and so on. Through these "integrations," the movement to accumulate and produce fertilizer has been vigorously launched, and at the same time, various other tasks have been driven forward. Adopting such a method of several "integrations" can not only make the work more comprehensive, but also more economical. Because combining various tasks often promotes each other, complements each other, and achieves twice the result with half the effort, which is naturally much more economical in terms of manpower, materials, and time than doing them individually.
    Integration is a very good working method, but it is not possible to do a good job no matter how it is done. The same is true of integration, but some places have made great achievements, while others have made relatively small achievements. This is because some are well integrated, and some are not well integrated. Poor integration may have three situations: First, various tasks are integrated, but the key points are not prominent, and the central tasks are submerged in non-central tasks; second, the key points are prominent, but the key points and non-key points are not closely integrated, so non-key tasks seem somewhat backward; third, the key points are prominent, but the key points and various non-key tasks are not integrated in a balanced way, so some of the non-key tasks have caught up, while others have fallen behind. A good integration should be one that correctly reflects the positions that various tasks should occupy and the objective relationships between them.
    Therefore, in actual work, to make various tasks correctly integrated, it cannot be achieved by simply issuing a general call or making a simple arrangement. Things are not isolated, but are mutually constrained and influenced; and each thing itself is constantly changing. The influence between them is also changing. When arranging the integration of various tasks, it is necessary to carefully study these situations. When arranging work at any time, we must consider the relationship between key points and light points, and consider the large or small influence between various tasks. Only in this way can the work be correctly integrated and fully developed. When the work is developed and the relationship between various tasks changes, it is necessary to organize a new integration between various tasks according to the new situation.
    It can be seen that this kind of integration is not only a matter of working methods and ideological methods, but also a matter of work style. It is relatively easy to put forward a slogan of "three integrations" or "five integrations," but to ensure that various tasks are integrated properly and achieve comprehensive victory, it requires in-depth and meticulous work. One of the most important tasks is to conduct careful investigation and research, deeply understand the internal connections of various practical tasks and their external connections, and gradually grasp the development laws of various tasks. This is one of the indispensable and important conditions for achieving a comprehensive leap forward in various tasks.

    谈“结合”
    程浦
    社会主义事业一天比一天兴旺，我们的工作也越来越繁多。这么多的工作，若是孤立地一件一件地去做，就很难都做好。于是人们找到一个良好的工作方法，就是把各项彼此具有一定联系的工作结合起来做。拿农村工作来说，农林牧副渔全面发展，并不是各自孤立地发展，而是农业经济五大部门的结合。在“五业”之中，每个部门又有许多项工作，这些工作也需要结合。我们常常听到各地在实际工作中提出所谓“两结合”、“三结合”、“五结合”以至更多的“结合”。工作结合得好，就好办得多。
    事物都有主要矛盾和诸多的次要矛盾；主要矛盾和次要矛盾又有密切的联系。每个时期都有最重要的、具有决定意义的中心工作，但是中心以外的许多工作也同中心工作不可分离。采取几“结合”的方法，就可以在集中主力猛攻中心工作的条件下，把其他工作也全面地抓起来。这样一来，中心工作突出了、大踏步地前进了，其他工作也围绕中心工作前进了。正所谓“纲举目张”。比如，许多地区在积肥造肥中就实行了许多个“结合”，例如，积肥造肥与备耕结合，与运肥、施肥结合，与夏收作物田间管理结合，与发展畜牧业和副业生产结合，与卫生运动结合，等等。通过这些个“结合”，就把积肥造肥运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，同时也把其他各项工作带动起来。采取这样几“结合”的方法，不但可以把工作做得较全面，而且可以做得更经济。因为把各项工作结合起来做，常常会使它们互相促进，相得益彰，事半功倍，这比孤立地一件一件地去做，自然要节省好多人力、物力和时间。
    结合是个很好的工作方法，但是，并不是随便怎样结合都能把工作做好。同是结合，有的地方做出的成绩很大，有的地方做出的成绩却比较小。这是因为有的结合得好，有的结合得不好。不好的结合，可能有三种情形：一、各项工作是结合起来了，但重点不突出，中心工作淹没在非中心的工作中；二、重点突出了，但是重点与非重点结合得不够紧密，因此非重点工作显得有些落后；三、重点突出了，但是重点与各个非重点工作结合得不平衡，以致非重点的工作中有的跟上来了，有的却落后了。好的结合，应当是正确地反映着诸项工作应占的地位和它们之间的客观联系的那种结合。
    所以，在实际工作中，使各项工作正确结合，并不是泛泛地号召一下，或者简单地布置一下就能办到的。事物不是孤立的，而是互相制约、互相影响的；而各个事物本身又在不断的变化中。它们相互之间的影响，也在变化着。在安排各项工作的结合的时候，不能不细致地研究这些情况。任何时候安排工作，都要考虑重点和轻点的关系、考虑各项工作相互间的或大或小的影响。这样才能使工作正确结合，全面发展。工作发展了，各项工作之间的关系变化了，又需要根据新的情况来组织各项工作之间新的结合。
    可见，这种结合，不仅是工作方法、思想方法问题，也是工作作风问题。提出个“三结合”或“五结合”的口号是比较容易的，要保证各项工作结合得恰到好处，取得全面的胜利，则需要深入的细致的工作。其中最重要的一项工作是，认真地进行调查研究，深刻地了解各项实际工作的内部联系和它们之间的外部联系，逐步掌握各项工作的发展规律。这是实现各项工作全面跃进所不可缺少的重要条件之一。
