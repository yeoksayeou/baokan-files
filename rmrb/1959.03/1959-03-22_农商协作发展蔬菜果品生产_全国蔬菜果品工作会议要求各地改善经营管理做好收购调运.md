Xinhua News Agency, 21st -- The National Vegetable and Fruit Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Commerce concluded on the 20th. The conference decided to focus on doing a good job in the operation of vegetables and fruits on the basis of the great development of vegetable and fruit production, and strive to solve the problem of insufficient vegetable supply in some areas as soon as possible, so as to achieve sufficient quantity, variety, and convenient and timely supply.

Due to the attention and careful arrangements of the local party committees, the national vegetable cultivation area this year will increase by about 50% compared with last year, and the vegetable yield will increase greatly compared with last year. The conference believes that it is entirely possible to meet the needs of urban and rural people for vegetables on this basis. The conference requested that commercial departments in various regions cooperate closely with agricultural departments to promote the development of vegetable production. Since vegetable production has certain technicalities, commercial departments in various regions should assist people's communes in establishing professional teams (groups) to be specifically responsible for vegetable production. The conference believes that solving the seed problem is the central link in vegetable production. When arranging this year's vegetable planting area, commercial departments should assist people's communes to establish seed bases with 5% or more of the total vegetable field area. In this way, it is possible to achieve self-sufficiency in general vegetable seeds, except for special varieties and fine varieties that need to be allocated. In addition, commercial departments should also assist communes in establishing specialized groups or designating special personnel to be responsible for seed production among vegetable growers according to needs; pay attention to rationally controlling the price of vegetable seeds, and ensure that the actual income from producing vegetable seeds is higher than the income from producing vegetables.

In terms of fruit production, the conference requested commercial departments to actively assist agricultural and forestry departments in formulating long-term fruit production plans, and to vigorously promote the development of fruit production by collecting improved varieties, allocating fruit seedlings, and strengthening the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery.

The conference emphasized that on the basis of striving to develop vegetable and fruit production, commercial departments must make every effort to do a good job in the purchase and transportation of vegetables and fruits. The active role of the supply and marketing departments of the people's communes should be brought into play, and purchases should be vigorously organized through them; in the peak season, mobile purchase teams should also be organized and purchase stations should be set up at fixed points to facilitate mass sales. In order to ensure a balanced supply of vegetables in the off-season and peak season, the conference particularly emphasized the need to vigorously carry out vegetable storage and processing in the peak season. In addition to commercial departments increasing their own processing and storage equipment, they should also organize people's communes, organizations, groups, factories, schools, and public canteens to process and store vegetables. Commercial departments should help people's communes build vegetable cellars and processing plants, and make processing and storage plans for both the vegetables used by the communes themselves and the commercial vegetables; the existing processing equipment in cities should also be fully utilized, and the production of raw materials for pickles should be actively developed to ensure processing needs. In this way, the spoilage and loss of vegetables in the peak season can be reduced as much as possible, and the market supply in the off-season can be guaranteed. The conference requested that all regions generally attach importance to the processing and storage of fruits, so that wherever there are fruits, processing should be carried out.

This conference also arranged the allocation and supply plans for the thirty-three kinds of vegetables and fruits managed by the Ministry of Commerce; the representatives of the provinces and cities also planned and led the exchange of the third category of materials not managed by the central government during the conference, and signed 650 purchase and sale contracts through the exchange.

During the conference, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian spoke at the meeting.

More than 300 representatives from 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions attended the meeting.

    农商协作发展蔬菜果品生产
    全国蔬菜果品工作会议要求各地改善经营管理做好收购调运
    新华社21日讯　商业部召开的全国蔬菜果品工作会议已在20日结束。会议决定在蔬菜、果品生产大发展的基础上全力做好蔬菜、果品的经营工作，力争尽快地解决某些地区蔬菜供应不足的问题，做到数量足、品种多、供应方便及时。
    由于各地党委的重视和认真安排，今年全国的蔬菜耕种面积将比去年增加50％左右，蔬菜产量将比去年大大增加。会议认为，在这个基础上满足城乡人民对蔬菜的需要是完全可能的。会议要求各地商业部门要同农业部门密切协作，促进蔬菜生产的发展。由于蔬菜生产有一定的技术性，各地商业部门应该协助人民公社建立专业队（组），专门负责蔬菜生产。会议认为解决种子问题是蔬菜生产的中心一环，在安排今年蔬菜种植面积时，商业部门应协助人民公社以菜田总面积的5％或更大一点的面积，建立种籽基地。这样就可以做到除特殊品种、优良品种需要调剂外，一般菜籽都能自给。此外，商业部门还应根据需要协助公社在蔬菜种植人员中建立专业小组或指定专人负责菜籽生产；注意合理地掌握菜籽的价格，保证生产菜籽的实际收入较高于生产蔬菜的收入。
    在果品的生产方面，会议要求商业部门积极协助农林部门，制订长期的果品生产规划，并且要从搜集良种、调剂果苗、加强肥料、农药、药械的供应等工作着手，大力促进果品生产的发展。
    会议强调提出，在努力发展蔬菜、果品生产的基础上，商业部门必须全力搞好蔬菜果品的收购、调运工作，应该发挥人民公社供销部门的积极作用，通过他们大力组织收购；在旺季还要组织流动收购组和划片定点设立收购站，以便利群众出售。为了保证淡季、旺季能均衡供应蔬菜，会议特别强调旺季要大搞蔬菜贮存和加工工作。除了商业部门自己增加加工、贮存设备以外，还要组织人民公社、机关、团体、工厂、学校和公共食堂加工贮存蔬菜。商业部门要帮助人民公社建立菜窖、加工厂，对公社自用的蔬菜和商品菜都分别作出加工贮存计划；城市现有的加工设备也要充分利用，要积极发展咸酱菜加工原料的生产，保证加工需要。这样，就能尽量减少旺季蔬菜的腐烂、损耗，保证淡季市场供应。会议要求各地普遍重视果品的加工贮存工作，做到哪里有水果，哪里就搞加工。
    这次会议还安排了商业部主管的三十三种蔬菜、果品的调拨供应计划；对不属于中央管理的第三类物资，各省、市代表在会议期间也有计划有领导地进行了交流，并且通过交流签订了六百五十份购销合同。
    会议期间，国务院副总理李先念在会上讲了话。
    参加这次会议的有二十七个省、市、自治区的代表三百多人。（附图片）
