Deputy Manager of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Zhou Jiahua

    In 1959, the steel output of Benxi Iron and Steel Company increased by 1.6 times compared to last year, steel materials increased by 1.7 times compared to last year, and pig iron increased by 23% compared to last year. All our employees are determined and confident to overfulfill the various production tasks assigned by the state. Now, we put forward our competition conditions: (1) Guarantee to overfulfill the daily production plan for March. (2) Guarantee the completion of the state-stipulated pig iron and steel material allocation tasks. (3) Utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces: In March, the medium-sized blast furnaces of Iron Plant No. 1 should reach 2.3, and the large-sized blast furnaces of Iron Plant No. 2 should strive to reach 2.05. The annual average for Iron Plant No. 1 should reach 2.3, striving for 2.4; Iron Plant No. 2 should reach 2.2, with a pig iron qualification rate of 99.5%. (4) Small blast furnaces: The lifespan should reach more than half a year, with a coke ratio of 1, a utilization coefficient of 0.8 to 1, and a wind temperature of over 600 degrees. Continued improvements are still needed. (5) The utilization coefficient of electric furnaces can currently reach 36, and we strive for 37 for the whole year. The qualified rate of high-quality steel should reach 99%. (6) Converters should pass the technical barrier well in March and April. (7) The operating rate of rolling mills should reach 75%, and the average hourly quota should increase by more than 50%. (8) Iron ore and artificial rich ore should ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed. (9) The carbonization time of large coke ovens should be 13 hours, and the coke drum strength should be over 310 kilograms. (10) The finished product rate of refractory silica bricks should reach 95%, and the furnace utilization coefficient should be 0.048.
    Our measures are: (1) Under the unified leadership of the Party, give prominence to politics, continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, go all out, aim high, and vigorously carry out mass movements centered on the technical revolution, and rapidly push the technical revolution to a new climax in solving key production issues. (2) Launch a high-yield and high-quality movement month in March, striving for large-scale high yield. (3) Conscientiously implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" of the industrial constitution. (4) With the spirit of ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point efforts, vigorously grasp technical measures, and ensure the completion of all 125 measures of the company throughout the year. Key requirements: In terms of blast furnaces, continue to adopt the technical operation policy of simultaneously improving smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio. The main measures are to improve the quality and output of raw materials, mass-produce spherical agglomerates, increase the output of artificial rich ore, and give full play to the capacity of blast furnace auxiliary equipment. Increase the temperature of hot blast stoves, strengthen equipment maintenance, improve the lifespan of tuyeres and slag tapping holes, reduce the downtime of blast furnaces, protect the tapholes, and ensure safe production. In terms of steelmaking, continue to adopt the policy of multi-loading, fast smelting, and high-quality, high-yield, and multi-variety production. The main measures are: for electric furnaces, implement top-blowing oxygen, and for three-gas steelmaking, increase coal gas pressure. For converters, improve furnace lining lifespan, reduce molten iron consumption, and strengthen production organization and management. In terms of rolling and forging steel, adopt the policy of multiple passes and fast rolling. The main measures are: ① Separate installation of rolling mills. ② Improve heating furnaces and increase heating capacity. ③ Implement multi-pass steel feeding and two-way rolling. ④ Improve existing annealing furnaces to improve the heat treatment quality of steel.

    努力提高日产水平
    本溪钢铁公司副经理　周家华
    1959年本溪钢铁公司钢比去年增长一点六倍，钢材比去年增长一点七倍，生铁比去年增加23％。我们全体职工有决心、有信心超额完成国家给予的各项生产任务。现在，提出我们的竞赛条件：（一）保证超额完成3月份的日产计划。（2）保证完成国家规定的生铁、钢材调拨任务。（3）大中型高炉利用系数：3月一铁厂中型高炉要达到二点三，二铁厂大型高炉力争达到二点零五，全年平均，一铁厂要达到二点三，争取二点四；二铁厂要达到二点二，生铁合格率99.5％。（4）小高炉：寿命达到半年以上，焦比一，利用系数达到零点八至一，风温六百度以上，还要继续改善。（5）电炉利用系数目前能达到三十六，全年争取三十七，优质钢合格率达到99％。（6）转炉在3、4月份过好技术关。（7）轧钢机作业率达到75％，台时定额平均提高50％以上。（8）铁矿、及人造富矿保证高炉吃的饱吃的好。（9）大型焦炉炭化时间十三小时，焦炭转鼓强度三百一十公斤以上。（10）耐火矽砖成品率达到95％，炉窑利用系数零点零四八。
    我们的措施是：（1）在党的统一领导下，政治挂帅，继续反对保守，破除迷信，鼓足干劲，力争上游，大力开展以技术革命为中心内容的群众运动，迅速将技术革命推向解决生产关键的新高潮。（2）3月份开展高产优质运动月，争取大面积高产。（3）认真贯彻“两参一改三结合”的工业宪法。（4）以十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲的精神，大抓技术措施，全年一定保证全公司的一百二十五项措施完成，重点要求：高炉方面，继续采用提高冶炼强度与降低焦比同时并举的技术操作方针。主要措施是改进原料质量和产量，大量生产球型团矿，增加人造富矿产量，充分发挥高炉附属设备的能力。提高热风炉温度，加强设备维护，提高风口渣口的寿命，减少高炉的休风率，保护好出铁口，保证安全生产。炼钢方面继续采用多装、快炼和优质高产多品种的方针。主要措施是：电炉方面实行炉顶吹氧，三气炼钢煤气加压。转炉方面提高炉衬寿命，减少铁水消耗，加强生产组织管理。轧锻钢方面采用多条、快轧的方针，主要措施是：①轧钢机分装。②改进加热炉，提高加热能力。③实行多条喂钢和双路轧钢。④改进现有退火炉，提高钢材热处理质量。
