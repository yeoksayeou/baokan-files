Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd—Shenyang Medical College has established hospitals in rural people's communes, which has played a positive role in improving teaching, medical care, scientific research, and the ideological awareness of teachers and students.

Last September, the college established ten hospitals in Kaiyuan, Huanren, Xinmin counties, and the suburbs of Shenyang, as internship bases for senior students. After arriving in the countryside, teachers and students, on the one hand, carried out medical work, and on the other hand, paid attention to utilizing all favorable conditions to improve the quality of teaching and scientific research. They formed special groups to investigate rural sanitation and various medical conditions, accumulating data for teaching and scientific research. Because there are many traditional Chinese medicine doctors with rich medical experience in rural areas, they often consulted with these doctors to learn clinical experience and collect traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. Teachers also adopted on-site teaching methods, combining theoretical lectures on medical care with various cured cases. In terms of medical practice, students, through the medical work of rural hospitals, can independently diagnose and treat common diseases of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and otolaryngology.

After the establishment of rural hospitals, some changes have also taken place in the thinking of teachers and students. They eat and live with the peasants in the countryside and began to be infected by the excellent qualities of the peasants, strengthening the idea of serving the people. Some students climbed mountains and crossed ridges late at night to see patients, and some students gave their blood to patients. During deep plowing, autumn harvesting, and other labor, they delivered medicine to the fields, which was warmly welcomed by the members of the People's Commune.

    沈阳医学院在农村办医院
    提高了教学质量和师生的思想觉悟
    新华社沈阳2日电　沈阳医学院在农村人民公社建立医院，对提高教学、医疗、科学研究以及师生们的思想觉悟，都起了良好作用。
    去年9月间，这个学院在开原、桓仁、新民三个县和沈阳市郊人民公社创办了十所医院，做为高年级学生的实习基地。师生们到农村以后，一方面进行医疗工作，一方面注意利用各方面的有利条件，提高教学和科学研究的质量。他们组成专题小组，对农村卫生和各种病情进行调查，为教学和科学研究积累资料。由于农村有许多具有丰富医疗经验的中医师，他们经常和这些中医师共同会诊，学习中医的临床经验和搜集中医药方。教师们还采取现场教学方法，结合各种治愈病例进行医疗护理的理论讲授。在医疗实践方面，学生们通过乡村医院的医疗工作，对内、外、小儿、妇产和五官科的一般疾病都能独立诊断和治疗。
    农村医院建立后，在师生们的思想上也引起一些变化。他们在农村里和农民同吃、同住，开始受到农民优秀品质的感染，加强了为人民服务的思想。有的学生深夜爬山越岭为农民出诊，有的学生把自己的血输给病人。在深翻地、秋收等劳动中，他们把医药送到田间，受到人民公社社员们的热情欢迎。
