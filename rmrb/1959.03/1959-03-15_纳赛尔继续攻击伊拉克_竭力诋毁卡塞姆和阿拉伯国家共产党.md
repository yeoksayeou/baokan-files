Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 14th: Arab United Republic President Nasser continues to deliver speeches, vigorously slandering Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem and the communists of Arab countries.

Nasser delivered a lengthy speech to the masses gathered in front of the presidential palace in Damascus on March 13th, at the end of the funeral ceremony for Shihab, who was injured in the Iraqi rebellion, fled to Syria, and died.

In his speech, Nasser said: "The traitor Kassem is the agent of international communism in the Arab world. He has opened the gates of Iraq to all Syrian communist leaders." He said: "The traitor Kassem and the communists have united to prevent the unification of the Arab world."

Nasser attacked Kassem for doing his best to "sabotage the relations between Iraq and the UAR," and said that Kassem would suffer a fate similar to that of Nuri al-Said.

Nasser did not admit that the UAR "supported from behind" the Shawwaf rebellion in Iraq. He said that "the revolution in Mosul" was because Iraq "eliminated patriotic nationalists." He also said that "every free person in Iraq will rise up in revolt." He said that the accusations about Arif's conspiracy with the UAR against Kassem were "communist rumors fabricated by the Iraqi Communist Party." Kassem's trial of Arif was "to eliminate a true hero of pan-Arabism."

Nasser attacked the communists of Arab countries as "foreign agents." They "spread malice and hatred between the people of Iraq and the UAR," opposed "Arab nationalism and Arab unity," and wanted to establish a "Red Fertile Crescent" in the Arab world. He also insisted that the Egyptian Communist Party "accepts instructions from the Italian Communist Party."

Tens of thousands of people in Damascus participated in the funeral held by the Damascus authorities for the traitor Shihab, who was injured in the Shawwaf rebellion and died after fleeing to Syria. The funeral procession carried wreaths presented by President Nasser and other senior government officials, and shouted slogans such as "Avenge Shawwaf," "There is no place for communism and separatism in the Arab world," and "Baghdad, rise up against communism and reactionaries!"

This is the third time in three days that Nasser has delivered anti-Iraq speeches in Damascus. Nasser also delivered a speech in front of the presidential palace in Damascus on March 12th, vehemently attacking Kassem and the communists of Arab countries.

    纳赛尔继续攻击伊拉克
    竭力诋毁卡塞姆和阿拉伯国家共产党
    新华社14日讯　大马士革消息：阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔继续发表讲话，竭力诋毁伊拉克总理卡塞姆和阿拉伯国家的共产党人。
    纳赛尔13日在为参加伊拉克叛乱受伤逃到叙利亚毙命的希哈卜举行的葬礼仪式结束时，对聚集在大马士革总统府前的群众发表了长篇讲话。
    纳赛尔在讲话中说：“卖国贼卡塞姆是国际共产主义在阿拉伯世界中的代理人。他把伊拉克的大门向所有的叙利亚共产党领袖开放。”他说：“卖国贼卡塞姆和共产党联合起来阻止阿拉伯世界的统一。”
    纳赛尔攻击卡塞姆尽他最大的力量来“破坏伊拉克和阿联之间的关系”。并且说卡塞姆将遭到与努里·赛义德所遭到的相似的命运。
    纳赛尔不承认阿联“在背后支持”伊拉克的沙瓦夫叛乱事件。他说“摩苏尔的革命”是因为伊拉克“清除爱国的民族主义分子”。他还说伊拉克“每一个自由的人将起来暴动”。他说关于阿里夫同阿联合作阴谋反对卡塞姆的指责是“伊拉克共产党造谣”。卡塞姆审判阿里夫是“为了消除泛阿拉伯主义的一个真正的英雄”。
    纳赛尔攻击阿拉伯国家的共产党是“外国的代理人”。他们“在伊拉克和阿联人民之间散播恶意和仇恨”，反对“阿拉伯民族主义和阿拉伯统一”，想在阿拉伯世界建立一个“红色肥沃新月”。他还硬说埃及共产党“接受意大利共产党的指示”。
    大马士革数万人参加了大马士革当局为在沙瓦夫叛乱事件中负伤逃到叙利亚后死去的卖国贼希哈卜举行的葬礼。送葬行列举着纳赛尔总统以及其它政府高级官员敬献的花圈，并且高喊“为沙瓦夫报仇”，
  “在阿拉伯世界没有共产主义和分裂主义的地位”，“巴格达，起来反对共产主义和反动派吧！”等口号。
    这是纳赛尔三天内在大马士革连续发表反伊拉克演说的第三次。纳赛尔12日也曾经在大马士革总统府前面发表讲话，猛烈攻击卡塞姆和阿拉伯国家的共产党。
