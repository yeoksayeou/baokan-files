Many famous dramatic performers always put their heart and soul into their performances. Whether it's singing or acting, they can do it meticulously, so that the audience, after watching their performances, not only marvels at their superb art, but also admires their serious and responsible spirit.

I am reminded of the deceased Sichuan Opera actress Liao Jingqiu. She suffered from an incurable disease, and she knew she wouldn't live long. But while she was still alive, she did not waste her precious time. Every performance and film shoot was treated seriously and meticulously. The illness was cruelly tormenting her, but she fought it with great perseverance because she had a lofty goal in mind: to strive to serve the audience. Therefore, when I watched the film "Du Shiniang" starring her, I was deeply moved by her selfless spirit, and my admiration arose spontaneously.

However, not everyone has achieved this. Not long ago, I watched a Peking Opera performance. One of the actors was a renowned figure, considered first-rate. It was my first time watching him perform, and I had high expectations. But I was disappointed. This actor appeared on stage with half-opened eyes, looking listless. Both his singing and acting were so weak and unenthusiastic, it seemed he was just going through the motions. As a result, the prestige of this famous actor was greatly diminished in my eyes.

Not long after that, I watched another Peking Opera performance. The actors' level was said to be only second or third-rate, not as famous as the actor mentioned earlier. But they put in a lot of effort, and as a result, they performed very well, earning enthusiastic applause from the audience. I also excitedly clapped along. I secretly made a comparison in my heart and came to my own conclusion: watching their performance was much better than watching those famous actors who were just coasting on their reputation.

It seems that talent needs to be encouraged. If one thinks that because one has become famous, one can be careless in performance, the play will certainly not be performed well. Logically speaking, some famous actors have higher skills and many years of performing experience, providing them with favorable conditions. If they put in more effort, their artistic level could be greatly improved. But perhaps they have become arrogant, or perhaps they are indifferent, thinking that they can casually cope and others will still applaud, and that their reputation alone can sell tickets. Who knows that the audience has eyes and wants to see genuine performances. Even famous actors have to sing well. If one adopts an unserious attitude towards the cause one is engaged in and is unwilling to continue to study and delve deeper, even the highest level of performance will decline.

Conversely, some actors, whose artistic level is not very high and whose experience is not so rich, have a great strength: they are full of energy and strive to go upstream. They perform seriously, study hard, and as a result, they can perform very well, and their artistic level is constantly improving in practice. It seems that they will definitely surpass their predecessors, at least they will be much more promising than those famous actors who have talent but do not put in effort.

This makes me think of many things, first of all, our Great Leap Forward.

"To count the outstanding figures, we must look to the present day." In the Great Leap Forward, there have been countless heroes and models, all of whom are daring to think and act, able to work hard and skillfully, and more importantly, they also have a meticulous spirit and a serious and responsible work style. To be meticulous in work, one must have unlimited loyalty to the cause of the Party and the people, and think that every thing one does is related to the interests of the people. Doing it well is beneficial to the people, and doing it badly is harmful to the people. It is this sense of responsibility that motivates our heroes and models to be full of vigor and constantly move forward. Therefore, they have also become respectable people in the eyes of the people.

To have talent and also be encouraged, not to be arrogant, not to abandon oneself, to work seriously and responsibly, and to move forward meticulously forever. I think this is needed by everyone, not just dramatic performers.

    提倡一丝不苟
    易和元
    有很多著名的戏剧表演家，他们在演戏时总是那么卖力气，不论是唱和做，都能做到一丝不苟，使观众看了他们的表演后，不但惊叹他们艺术的精湛，而且对他们那种认真负责的精神，更是钦佩不已。
    我想起了已经去世的川剧演员廖静秋。她患了不治之症，而且自己也知道活不久了，但是当她还活着的时候，她没有虚度宝贵的时光，每一次演出、拍片，都很严肃，一丝不苟。病魔在残酷地折磨着她，她以很大的毅力与它搏斗，因为她心目中有一个崇高的目的：努力为观众服务。因此，当我看她主演的影片“杜十娘”的时候，就为她的这种忘我的精神深深感动，敬佩之情油然而生。
    但是，不是所有的人都做到了这点。不久以前看了一次京剧，其中有位演员是久负盛名的，算得第一流，我是第一次看他的戏，抱的希望很大。结果我却失望了。这个演员出场了，眼睛半睁半闭，懒懒散散，唱和做都那么有气无力，看来是在敷衍，走过场。于是这个名演员在我心目中的威信大大打了折扣。
    过了不久，又看了一次京剧。演员水平据说只能算是二三流的，不及前面说的那位演员有名。但是他们很卖力气，结果演得很好，博得观众热烈的掌声，我也兴奋地跟着鼓了掌。我心中暗地作了比较，得出自己的结论：看他们的戏，比看那些徒具盛名却不卖力气的名角强多了。
    看来，有才还得鼓劲。以为自己有了名，表演就可马虎，戏一定是演不好的。论理说，有些名演员，他们有较高的技巧，有多年的表演经验，条件优越，如果再加一把劲，他们的艺术水平还可大大提高。但是，他们也许骄傲了，也许是满不在乎，以为随随便便应付一下，别人也会喝采，单靠自己的名气也能卖座，谁知观众是有眼睛的，他们要看货真价实的戏，名角也得唱好才行。如果对自己所从事的事业采取不严肃的态度，不肯继续钻研，再高的表演水平也会每况愈下的。
    相反，有些演员，他们的艺术水平并不算很高，经验也不那么丰富，但是他们有一个最大的长处，鼓足干劲，力争上游。他们表演认真，努力钻研，结果却能演出很好的戏，艺术水平也在实践中不断提高。看来，他们是一定会超过他们的前辈的，至少要比那些有才而不卖力气的名演员有出息得多。
    由此使我想到了很多，首先是想到了我们的大跃进。
    “数风流人物还看今朝”，在大跃进中出现的英雄、模范何止千千万万，他们都是敢想敢干的人，能够苦干巧干的人，更重要的是他们还有一丝不苟的精神和严肃负责的工作作风。要做到工作上一丝不苟，必须要有对党和人民的事业的无限的忠心，想到每做一件事，都和人民的利害相关。做好了，对人民有利，做坏了对人民有害。正是这种工作责任感促使我们的英雄模范朝气勃勃，不断前进。因此他们也就成为人民心目中的可敬的人。
    有才而又鼓劲，不骄傲，不自暴自弃，工作认真负责，一丝不苟永远前进。我想，这是每一个人都需要的，岂止戏剧表演家而已。
