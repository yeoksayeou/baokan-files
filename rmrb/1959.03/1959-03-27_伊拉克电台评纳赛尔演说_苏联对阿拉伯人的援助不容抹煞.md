Xinhua News Agency, March 26th, Baghdad News: Iraqi Republic Radio published a commentary on the 23rd, severely criticizing UAR President Nasser for being ungrateful and trying hard to "find excuses for his policy of betraying the interests of the Arab nation."

The commentary said: "Nasser has repeatedly insulted and slandered Iraq, and offended the Soviet Union, the loyal friend of the Arabs, turning his back on the glorious position of the Soviet Union in supporting and saving Egypt."

The radio station said: "As for President Nasser's claim that he alone supported Iraq, it cannot stand the test of facts. The people of all Arab countries still remember these facts vividly. Because everyone knows that all Asian, African people and neutral countries condemned the Anglo-American aggression, while the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries adopted a decisive position of support. We want to ask the President: When Britain and France issued their ultimatum, why did Nasser rush to Moscow? The Anglo-French ultimatum at that time not only threatened Iraq but also threatened the Syrian region of the UAR. Does he not remember that Soviet leaders had announced their full support for Iraq and the UAR even before President Nasser told them this? Does he not remember that Egyptian newspapers at the time prominently published Soviet statements and the Soviet Union's mobilization of troops, thus allowing people to see the light through the clouds? The failure of the American and British aggressors in Lebanon and Jordan, and their failure to dare to attack Iraq and Syria, ultimately stemmed from the rapid consolidation of our republic and the decisive and thunderous blow struck by our republic with the full support of the Arab world and the entire world, especially the Soviet Union."

The commentary pointed out: "Arabs should not forget the good deeds of friends, just as they should not forget the conspiracies, aggressions, and enslavement of enemies. Nasser's casual denial of the role played by the Soviet Union's warnings issued in 1956 when Egypt was invaded, in 1957 when Syria was threatened, and in 1958 after Lebanon and Jordan were invaded, is completely contrary to Arab traditions. These are historical facts that cannot be erased, and erasing these historical facts is detrimental to the Arabs. We still have dozens of statements made by Nasser and other rulers of the UAR. In these statements, they praised the Soviet Union for its firm anti-imperialism, its assistance to the Arabs, its help to Egypt and the UAR in breaking the Anglo-American economic blockade of Egypt, and the Soviet Union's selfless assistance on issues such as the High Dam. An ungrateful person can only harm himself, just as a person who prides himself on violence cannot raise his own position, nor can he make his own people and other people respect him; he can only bankrupt himself."

### 伊拉克电台评纳赛尔演说  苏联对阿拉伯人的援助不容抹煞

    伊拉克电台评纳赛尔演说
    苏联对阿拉伯人的援助不容抹煞
    新华社26日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克共和国电台23日发表评论，严厉批评阿联总统纳赛尔忘恩负义，竭力“为他背弃阿拉伯民族利益的政策寻找借口”。
    评论说：“纳赛尔百般辱骂和诬蔑伊拉克，并且触犯阿拉伯人的忠实朋友苏联，翻脸不认苏联支援和拯救埃及的光荣立场。
    电台说：“至于纳赛尔总统说，只有他一个人支持了伊拉克，那是经不起事实驳斥的。阿拉伯各国人民对这些事实记忆犹新。因为大家都知道，所有亚非人民和中立国家都谴责过美英侵略，而苏联、中国和其它社会主义国家则采取了决定性的支持立场。我们要问总统：当英法发出最后通牒以后，纳赛尔为什么急急忙忙跑到了莫斯科？英法通牒当时不仅威胁了伊拉克，并且也威胁了阿联的叙利亚地区。难道他不记得：苏联领袖们甚至在纳赛尔总统向他们说出这一点以前就已宣布全力支援伊拉克和阿联吗？难道他不记得：当时埃及报纸大字登载苏联的声明和苏联集结军队从而使人得以拨云雾而见青天这件事吗？美英侵略者在黎巴嫩和约旦的失败和他们不敢进攻伊拉克和叙利亚，归根结蒂就是由于我们共和国的迅速巩固和我们共和国在阿拉伯世界和整个世界，特别是苏联的全面支持下进行了决定性的迅雷一般的打击。
    评论指出：“阿拉伯人不应该忘掉朋友的好处，正像他们不应该忘掉敌人的阴谋、侵略和奴役一样。纳赛尔这样随随便便地不承认苏联在1956年埃及受到侵略、1957年叙利亚受到威胁的时候以及1958年黎巴嫩和约旦受到侵略以后先后发出的警告所起的作用，是和阿拉伯人的传统完全违背的。这是一些不容抹煞的历史事实，抹杀这些历史事实对阿拉伯人是不利的。我们面前还摆着几十份纳赛尔和阿联其他统治者所发表的声明。他们在这些声明中赞扬苏联坚决反帝，援助阿拉伯人，帮助埃及和阿联打破美英对埃及的经济封锁，以及在高水坝等问题上苏联的无私援助。忘恩负义的人只能对自己不利，正像以强暴自豪的人抬不高自己的地位，也不能使他自己的人民和其他人民尊敬，而只能使自己破产一样。”
