Xinhua News Agency, 20th: People's Liberation Army units stationed in various locations have recently been enthusiastically participating in socialist construction voluntary labor with a heroic fighting spirit. They are determined to work with the people of the whole country to make new contributions to achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction this year.

Many units have designated March as a "shock month" for supporting socialist construction, with entire divisions and regiments of officers and soldiers going to construction sites to launch an attack on nature. According to incomplete statistics from units in the Shenyang area up to March 5th, the labor days devoted to supporting industrial and agricultural construction and accumulating fertilizer and seizing water for the people's communes have reached 1,225,000. In the Yuguo Tuofeng marshalling yard, the Qinghe Reservoir, and the Tie (ling) Fa (ku) railway construction site leading to the Liaobei mining area, officers and soldiers in this area have widely launched a labor competition centered on quantity, quality, and safety, and the project is progressing extremely rapidly. The Guangzhou area units participating in the construction of 29 projects, including the Luojia Ferry coal mine railway special line, part of the Beijing-Guangzhou railway double line project, the Xiangzi Bridge in the Chao-Shan area, and the Tuo-Shan Highway, had completed more than 549,000 labor days by the end of February. The Jinan area units participating in the construction of 23 water conservancy projects have completed more than 190,000 cubic meters of earthwork. By the end of February, units in the Nanjing area had used more than 420,000 labor days to accumulate more than 230 million catties of fertilizer for local people's communes, build more than 50 reservoirs, and complete more than 370,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Officers and soldiers of a certain division, recently awarded a collective third-class merit by the Ministry of National Defense, are fully utilizing their past experience in building the Songhua River levee at the Mohe Mountain Reservoir construction site in the Changbai Mountains, and are stepping up construction, determined to make Taohua water serve spring plowing and strive for a bumper grain harvest this year.

According to the Outline of the Army's Participation in Socialist Construction issued by the General Political Department, all units have generally formulated work plans for participating in socialist construction this year and have submitted these plans to the local Party committee for inclusion in the local construction plan. According to preliminary statistics, the voluntary labor days that garrisons in various places plan to use for participating in national construction this year are generally much more than last year. Units in the Shenyang area plan to use 6 million to 7 million labor days to support local production and construction, and concentrate their main forces on supporting several large and medium-sized basic construction projects. Of the 4 million labor days that the Guangzhou area units plan to support locally, about 60% of the time will be used to support larger basic construction projects. In addition, the units have also stipulated in the plan that they should support the people's communes in an organized and planned manner, not only actively participating in the seasonal agricultural production labor of the communes in batches, but also using great efforts to support the communes in building water conservancy and hydropower stations, manufacturing and repairing agricultural machinery and tools, and helping the communes train technicians, drivers, health workers, veterinarians, accountants, telephone operators and other technical personnel.

    在生产战线上立新功
    解放军各部队大规模参加社会主义建设
    新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军驻各地部队最近以英勇的战斗姿态热烈参加了社会主义建设义务劳动，他们决心同全国人民一道，为争取今年工农业生产和建设的更大更好更全面的跃进立下新功勋。
    许多部队都把3月份作为支援社会主义建设的突击月，整师整团官兵开赴工地，向大自然展开了进攻。据沈阳地区部队到3月5日止的不完全统计，支援工农业建设和为人民公社积肥夺水所做的劳动日已达一百二十二万五千个。这个地区的部队官兵在裕国驼峰编组场、清河水库和通向辽北煤矿区的铁（岭）法（库）铁路工地上，广泛展开了以数量多、质量高、保证安全为中心的劳动竞赛，工程进展极快。广州地区部队参加修建的罗家渡煤矿铁路专用线、京广铁路复线部分工程、潮汕地区的湘子大桥，鮀汕公路等二十九项工程，到2月底已经做了五十四万九千多个劳动日，济南地区部队参加修建的二十三项水利工程，已经完成十九万多土方。南京地区部队到2月底止，已用四十二万多个劳动日，为当地人民公社积肥二亿三千多万斤，修建水库五十多座，完成三十七万多土方。最近被国防部批准获得集体三等功的某师官兵，在长白山区磨盒山水库工地充分运用了过去修建松花江江堤的筑堤经验，正在加紧施工，决心要使桃花水为春耕服务，争取今年粮食大丰收。
    根据总政治部发布的军队参加社会主义建设工作纲要，各部队普遍制订了今年参加社会主义建设的工作规划，并把这一规划报请当地党委列入当地的建设规划中。据初步统计，各地驻军今年计划用于参加国家建设的义务劳动日普遍比去年多得多。沈阳地区部队计划用六百万到七百万个劳动日支援地方生产建设，并集中主要力量支援几项大、中型的基本建设工程。广州地区部队计划支援地方的四百万个劳动日中，60％左右的时间将用于支援较大的基本建设工程。此外，各部队还在规划中规定，要有组织有计划地支援人民公社，不仅分批积极参加公社季节性的农业生产劳动，而且还要用很大力量支援公社兴修水利和水电站，制造修理农业机械和农具，帮助公社训练技术员、司机、卫生员、兽医、会计、电话员等技术人材。
