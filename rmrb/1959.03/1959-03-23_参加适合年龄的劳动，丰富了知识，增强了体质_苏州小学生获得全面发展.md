Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 22nd. Primary schools in the Jinchang District of Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, organize students over the age of nine to participate in a variety of age-appropriate labor activities, enabling them to achieve all-round development. Schools arrange tasks for students according to different classes, including brush making, straw mat production, willow basket weaving, embroidery, seal carving, brick making, and manufacturing crystal radios.

Through various labor activities, students have developed labor habits and a greater love for labor. In the past, some students at Xinhua Primary School did not like to work and would wander around the streets after school until dark before returning home. Now they have changed. Not only can they earnestly participate in school labor, but they also help with household chores when they have free time. Students' writing ability has also improved significantly. Fourth-grade students at Zhu Zhuang Primary School could originally only write up to 200 words in their compositions, and the content was relatively poor. Now that they have firsthand experience with labor, they can incorporate their feelings about labor into their compositions, such as in a composition titled "Our Vegetables Are So Big!" They can generally write about 400 words, and their vocabulary is also richer. Students at Taowu Central Primary School have also written children's works such as poems, essays, and rhythmic stories.

Through labor, students have enriched their production knowledge and initially mastered some simple production skills. For example, students at Zhu Zhuang Primary School understand the production process of mushrooms and the technology for managing mushroom laboratories, and they have also learned to grow vegetables. Children's physical fitness has also improved. Zhao Ziliang, a sixth-grade student at Zhu Zhuang Primary School, originally had poor physical fitness and frequently took sick leave. After a period of labor, his complexion changed from pale to rosy, and he rarely takes sick leave anymore. (Attached Picture)

    参加适合年龄的劳动，丰富了知识，增强了体质
    苏州小学生获得全面发展
    新华社南京22日电　江苏苏州市金阊区各小学组织九岁以上的学生，进行适合年龄特点的多种多样劳动，使他们获得全面的发展。各校按照不同班级，为学生们安排了穿刷子、制草垫、编柳条篮、刺绣、雕刻图章、做砖坯、制造矿石收音机等项劳动。
    通过各种劳动，学生们养成劳动习惯，更加热爱劳动了。新华小学有个别学生过去不爱劳动，一放学就在街上闲荡，不到天黑不回家。现在他们有了转变，不但能认真参加学校劳动，有空还帮助家里劳动。学生写作能力也有显著提高。朱庄小学四年级学生，原来作文最多只能写二百多字，内容比较贫乏。现在对劳动有了切身体会，在一次以“我们的青菜好大啊”为题的作文中，能把自己在劳动中的感情写到作文里，一般都能写到四百字左右，词汇也比较丰富。桃坞中心小学的学生还写出了诗歌、散文、快板等儿童作品。
    通过劳动，学生们丰富了生产知识，初步掌握了一些简易的生产技能。如朱庄小学的学生能懂得蘑菇的生产过程和管理蘑菇试验室的技术，并且学会了种植蔬菜。儿童的体质也增强了。朱庄小学六年级学生赵子良，原来体质较差，经常请病假，经过一个时期的劳动以后，面色由白转红，很少再请病假。（附图片）
