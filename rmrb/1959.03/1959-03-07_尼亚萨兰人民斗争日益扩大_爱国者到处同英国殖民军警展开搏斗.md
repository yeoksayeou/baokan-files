Xinhua News Agency, March 6th, Blantyre dispatch: The atmosphere throughout Nyasaland remained very tense on the 5th. Emotionally charged Africans continued to use spears, clubs, and axes as weapons to fight the British colonial troops and police everywhere. It is reported that on the 5th alone, struggles against colonial rule occurred in thirty locations, and many roads, bridges, and buildings constructed by the colonialists to rule the Africans were "severely damaged."

On the evening of the 5th, a fierce battle took place near a roadblock in southern Nyasaland, near the capital, Zomba. Colonial police opened fire on spear-wielding Africans, killing five and injuring four.

Reports say that the situation is also tense in the areas of Fort Manning and Kota Kota in central Nyasaland. Colonial authorities admit that tension and unrest are also increasing in Chisenga, Rumpi, and Mzimba in the north. All roads north and south of Mzimba have been "severely damaged."

In Fort Hill, on the northern border of Nyasaland, roads and bridges have been heavily damaged, even though British colonial police from Tanganyika had already arrived here to suppress the resistance. Reports say that a total of five bridges have been destroyed on the main road from Rumpi to Fort Hill, leading to East Africa.

Reports say that in addition to continuing to dispatch large numbers of armed military police to the scene of incidents for suppression, the colonial authorities also sent planes on the 5th to distribute 30,000 leaflets throughout Nyasaland. These leaflets, in addition to making armed threats, also threatened that if resistance did not cease, and the destruction of bridges, roads, and buildings continued, the colonialists would close the tobacco markets in those areas and stop purchasing tobacco produced by Africans. At the same time, fines would be imposed on Africans in these areas. Tobacco is Nyasaland's main agricultural product and is the economic crop upon which many Africans rely for their livelihood.

In order to find an excuse for their bloody suppression, the British colonial authorities are trying their best to portray the just struggle of the Nyasaland Africans against colonial rule and their resistance to the barbaric suppression of the colonialists as a "massacre" premeditated by the African National Congress. However, even the British "Manchester Guardian" pointed out that there is no evidence to prove this claim.

The British colonial authorities' efforts to block news also show their nervousness. According to a Reuters reporter's dispatch from Blantyre on the 6th, all news telegrams sent from Nyasaland are subject to censorship. An urgent telegram sent by a reporter from Blantyre had not arrived thirty-four hours after it was sent.

The Nyasaland people's confidence in opposing the British-created Central African "Federation" and striving for autonomy and independence is unwavering. Before being arrested, Hastings Banda, President of the Nyasaland African National Congress, wrote a letter to British Labour Party MP Brockway, stating, "Arresting me, or sending troops and police from Southern Rhodesia, will not make us deviate from our path."

The letter, published in the British "Tribune" weekly on the 5th, also said, "The morale of the people is very high. Although there are troops everywhere and planes flying in the sky, the people are as firm as ever."

### 尼亚萨兰人民斗争日益扩大  爱国者到处同英国殖民军警展开搏斗

    尼亚萨兰人民斗争日益扩大
    爱国者到处同英国殖民军警展开搏斗
    新华社6日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰全境的气氛在5日仍然十分紧张。情绪激昂的非洲人继续用长矛、棍棒和斧头为武器，到处同英国殖民军队和警察展开斗争。有消息说，在5日一天，就有三十个地方发生了反对殖民统治的斗争，殖民者为统治非洲人而建筑的许多公路、桥梁和建筑物，遭到“严重破坏”。
    5日晚上在尼亚萨兰南部、首府松巴附近的一个路障旁边发生了一次剧烈的战斗。殖民警察向手持长矛的非洲人开枪，打死五人，打伤四人。
    消息说，在尼亚萨兰中部的曼宁堡和科塔科塔一带，局势也很紧张。殖民当局承认，在北面的契森加、鲁姆皮和姆津巴，紧张和不安的气氛也在日益增加。姆津巴以北和以南的所有公路都已遭到“严重破坏”。
    在尼亚萨兰北部边境的希尔堡，公路和桥梁被破坏得很厉害，虽然早些日子坦噶尼喀的英国殖民警察已经开到这里来镇压。有消息说，在从鲁姆皮到希尔堡这一条通往东非的主要公路上，共有五座桥梁被破坏。
    有消息说，殖民当局除继续派出大批武装军警赶到各出事地点进行镇压外，在5日还派出飞机到尼亚萨兰各地散发了三万张传单，这些传单除了进行武力恫吓外，还威胁说，如果哪里再不停止反抗，继续破坏桥梁、道路和建筑物，殖民者就将在哪里关闭烟草市场，停止收购非洲人生产的烟草。同时，将对这些地区的非洲人征收罚金。烟草是尼亚萨兰的主要农产品，是许多非洲人赖以为生的经济作物。
    英国殖民当局为了替他们的血腥镇压行动寻找借口，竭力把尼亚萨兰非洲人反对殖民统治、抵抗殖民者野蛮镇压的正义斗争，说成是非洲人国民大会预谋进行“屠杀”。但是，就是英国“曼彻斯特卫报”也指出，并无证据能证明这种说法。
    英国殖民当局竭力封锁新闻的做法也表明了它的心虚。据路透社记者6日从布兰太尔报道，从尼亚萨兰发出的一切新闻电讯都要受到检查。有一名记者自布兰太尔发出的一条急电自发出后三十四小时尚未到达。
    尼亚萨兰人民反对英国制造的中非“联邦”、争取自治和独立的信心坚定不移。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达在被捕以前曾写给英国工党议员布罗克威一封信，信中说，“逮捕我，或从南罗得西亚派军队和警察来，都不会使我们离开我们的道路”。
    发表在5日的英国“论坛”周报上的这封信还说，“人民的士气非常高。虽然到处都是军队，飞机在空中飞翔，人民还是同往常一样坚定。”
