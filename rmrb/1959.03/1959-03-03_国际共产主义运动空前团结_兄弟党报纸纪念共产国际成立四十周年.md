Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Newspapers of fraternal parties in countries such as North Korea, Vietnam, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Japan published articles commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Comintern.

The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun"’s commentary on the 2nd stated: "Under the leadership of Lenin, the Comintern, through all its activities, educated the ranks of the international working class to be armed with the ideas of proletarian dictatorship and proletarian internationalism, and thoroughly shattered the bourgeois ideological currents within socialism."

The commentary said: "Today, the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries, inheriting the great cause of the Comintern, are leading the working people of their respective countries in achieving great victories in the struggle for peace, socialism, and national independence."

The commentary said: "The Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in November 1957 was of great significance for the development of the international communist and workers' movement. The Moscow Declaration embodies the unbreakable unity of the international communist movement based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

The commentary said: "The anti-Marxist views of the Yugoslav revisionists have been thoroughly crushed in the practice of the international communist movement." "Today, no force can stop the advance of the great victory of socialism."

The commentary concluded: "Under the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea, one of the glorious troops of the international communist movement, the Korean people will surely achieve victory in the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the construction of socialism."

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an article entitled "The Unity and Cohesion of the International Communist and Workers' Movement is Growing Stronger," stating that the unity and cohesion of the international communist and workers' movement has never been as consolidated as it is today, and its strength has never been as great as it is today.

The article pointed out that imperialism, which is in the process of collapsing, is adopting the most despicable and barbaric means in an attempt to hinder the advancement of the international communist and workers' movement. They are directing their henchmen in various countries to rampantly launch anti-communist activities. This is essentially an attack on the movement for independence, democracy, and peace. Imperialism also praises modern revisionists represented by the Tito group in Yugoslavia, attempting to use this gang to split the international communist and workers' movement.

The article said that the true faces of all dark and reactionary forces have been exposed. In the near future, they will surely receive the final punishment of history.

The article said that the Vietnamese revolution has achieved great victories under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh. Looking back on the road we have traveled and the victories we have achieved, we clearly realize that the unity and cohesion within the Party and the unity and cohesion of the international communist and workers' movement are prerequisites for achieving victory. Therefore, today we must more resolutely defend this unity and cohesion.

Czechoslovakia’s "Rude Pravo" published an article on the 2nd celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Comintern.

The article said that the history of the Comintern is a great lesson in proletarian internationalism.

The newspaper emphasized that in order to establish new-style revolutionary proletarian parties and strive for their leading role in the revolutionary workers' movement, the Comintern consistently fought revisionism in various places. Therefore, the history of the Comintern is first and foremost an example of an irreconcilable, principled struggle against revisionist and opportunist tendencies in the workers' movement. Marxist-Leninist parties are still continuing this struggle today.

The newspaper pointed out that at present, it is particularly necessary to fight against Yugoslav revisionism. Under the guise of "national communism," Yugoslav revisionism attempts to split the unity of the international communist and revolutionary movement and its greatest achievement—the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The newspaper went on to say that these attempts by Yugoslav revisionists have been opposed by the communist parties of various countries. The proletarian internationalism that added new features to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an unbreakable fortress.

The Hungarian "Népszabadság" published an article on the 1st on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Comintern entitled "The Growing Strength of Proletarian Internationalism." The article elaborated on the heroic struggles of the working class and the development of the workers' movement since the founding of the Comintern. The article emphasized that the entire history of the workers' movement is also a history of revolutionaries constantly fighting against opportunists.

The article said that today, the strength of the international communist movement and internationalist unity proves that we have taken great strides towards the final victory of communism.

The Japanese Communist Party organ "Akahata"’s editorial on the 2nd pointed out that in the current period of transition from capitalism to socialism, in order to strengthen the front against imperialism and against war, it is of decisive importance to strengthen the international unity of the workers' parties of various countries and these parties. The editorial said that the declaration issued by the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in Moscow in November 1957 has become the international charter of the world communist movement, and this declaration inherits the principles of party building stipulated by the Comintern—to launch a struggle against all revisionism to uphold the revolutionary purity of the party and the organizational principle of democratic centralism.

The editorial pointed out that when the socialist world system is becoming increasingly dominant and the broad masses of people recognize that capitalism is bound to collapse and socialism is bound to be realized, the bourgeoisie always deliberately spreads fallacies, distorts Marxism-Leninism, and conspires to weaken the strength of the Communist Party and undermine their international unity. Yugoslav revisionism is a typical example.

    国际共产主义运动空前团结
    兄弟党报纸纪念共产国际成立四十周年
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：朝鲜、越南、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和日本等国兄弟党报纸发表文章，纪念共产国际成立四十周年。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”2日的评论说：“共产国际在列宁的领导下，通过自己的全部活动，教育国际工人阶级的队伍以无产阶级专政和无产阶级国际主义思想武装起来，彻底地粉碎了社会主义内部的资产阶级思想潮流。”
    评论说：“今天，继承共产国际伟大事业的各国共产党和工人党，领导本国的劳动人民在和平和社会主义以及民族独立的斗争中取得了巨大的胜利。”
    评论说：“1957年11月在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议对发展国际共产主义和工人运动有着巨大意义。莫斯科宣言体现了国际共产主义运动根据马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的牢不可破的团结一致。”
    评论说：“南斯拉夫修正主义者的反马克思主义的见解，在国际共产主义运动的实践过程中被彻底粉碎了。”“今天没有任何力量可以阻挡社会主义伟大胜利的前进。”
    评论最后说：“在国际共产主义运动的光荣部队之一——朝鲜劳动党的领导下，朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的伟大事业必将获得胜利。”
    越南“人民报”发表题为“国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结一致日益巩固”的文章说，国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结一致从来没有像今天这样的巩固，它的力量也从来没有像今天这样的强大。
    文章指出，处在崩溃过程中的帝国主义，采取最卑鄙和野蛮的手段，企图阻挠国际共产主义运动和工人运动前进的步伐。他们指使他们在各国的爪牙猖狂地展开反共活动。这在实质上是对争取独立、民主、和平的运动的进攻。帝国主义还赞扬以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，企图利用这帮人来分裂国际共产主义运动和工人运动。
    文章说，现在一切黑暗和反动势力的真面目已经暴露无遗。不远的将来，他们一定会受到历史最后的惩罚。
    文章说，越南革命在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导下已经取得了伟大的胜利。回顾所走过的道路和所取得的胜利，我们清楚地认识党内的团结一致以及国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结一致是取得胜利的先决条件，因此，今天必须更加坚决地保卫这种团结一致。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”2日发表文章庆祝共产国际建立四十周年。
    文章说，共产国际的历史是无产阶级国际主义的伟大课程。
    报纸着重指出，共产国际为了建立新式的革命的无产阶级政党和争取它们在革命工人运动中的领导作用，始终如一地在各个地方同修正主义进行斗争。因此，共产国际的历史首先是同工人运动中的修正主义和机会主义倾向进行不调和的原则性斗争的范例。各马克思列宁主义政党今天仍旧在继续这个斗争。
    报纸指出，在目前，特别需要同南斯拉夫修正主义进行斗争。南斯拉夫修正主义在“民族共产主义”的掩盖下力图分裂国际共产主义和革命运动的团结以及它的最伟大的成就——以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的团结。报纸接着说，南斯拉夫修正主义者的这些企图已遭到各国共产党的反对。为苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会增添了新的特色的无产阶级国际主义是坚不可破的堡垒。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”1日就共产国际成立四十周年发表了题为“增长着的无产阶级国际主义力量”的文章。文章阐述了共产国际成立以后工人阶级的英勇斗争和工人运动的发展，文章强调指出，工人运动的整个历史也是革命者对机会主义者不断进行斗争的历史。
    文章说，今天国际共产主义运动的力量和国际主义团结，证实了我们已经以极大的步伐向共产主义的最后胜利迈进。
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”2日社论指出，在现在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期，为了加强反对帝国主义和反对战争的阵线，加强各国工人阶级政党和这些党之间的国际团结是有决定性的重要意义。社论说，1957年11月在莫斯科举行的社会主义各国共产党和工人党代表会议所发表的宣言，已经成为世界共产主义运动的国际统一的宪章，同时这项宣言继承了共产国际所规定的建党原则——同所有修正主义展开斗争以坚持党的革命纯洁性和民主集中制的组织原则。
    社论指出，在社会主义世界体系越来越占优势、广泛的人民群众认识到资本主义必然崩溃而社会主义必能实现的时候，资产阶级总是要故意散布谬论，歪曲马列主义，阴谋削弱共产党的力量，破坏它们的国际团结。南斯拉夫的修正主义就是一个典型例子。
