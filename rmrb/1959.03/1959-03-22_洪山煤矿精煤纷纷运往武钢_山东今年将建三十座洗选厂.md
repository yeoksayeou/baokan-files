Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: Shandong Province will build thirty coal washing plants this year, with a designed annual washing capacity of 15.9 million tons. Twenty-two plants have already started or are about to start construction. The vast majority of these coal washing plants are located in high-quality coking coal producing areas, such as Zaozhuang, Guanqiao, Xinwen, and Feicheng mining areas. Twenty-seven of these plants will be handed over to production within this year.

In order to complete the construction of twenty coal washing plants in stages during the first half of this year, the Shandong Provincial Coal Industry Bureau has established a special leading body headed by the bureau director to promptly dispatch and inspect the work. Various mining bureaus are also actively preparing materials and transferring cadres and workers to make a crash effort in the construction of coal washing plants. At the construction sites where construction has already started, workers have put forward the slogan of "Accelerate the construction of coal washing plants and supply good rations to the steel commander," launching a competition movement centered on technological revolution to compare speed, quality, and safety. They have adopted the method of parallel cross-operation construction, greatly accelerating the progress of the project.

Various mining bureaus have also sent a large number of workers and cadres to coal washing plants in the Northeast and in Shandong Province to learn operating techniques, making preparations for the production of the new coal washing plants.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th: Hongshan Coal Mine Washing Plant of Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province is tapping the potential of equipment to produce more high-quality coal to support Wuhan Iron and Steel. This plant shipped more than 15,500 tons of high-quality coal to Wuhan Iron and Steel six and a half days ahead of schedule in February, which was praised by the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel. From March 1st to 15th, in the "Six Comparisons" red flag competition, it overfulfilled the washing plan for the first half of the month by 13.2%, and continued to support Wuhan Iron and Steel with more than 7,300 tons of high-quality coal.

This plant is tasked with supplying 200,000 tons of high-quality coal to Wuhan Iron and Steel this year, and the original designed annual production capacity of the plant's equipment is only 200,000 tons. However, in order to wash more and better coal for Wuhan Iron and Steel, the workers have tried every possible means to tap the potential of the equipment, increasing the annual production capacity to 600,000 tons. At the same time, the method of setting up gatekeepers at all levels and contracting responsibility is adopted. Float-sink sampling and testing are carried out every half hour, resolutely preventing gangue from passing the "gate," so that the high-quality coal meets the quality standards required by Wuhan Iron and Steel.

    洪山煤矿精煤纷纷运往武钢
    山东今年将建三十座洗选厂
    新华社济南21日电　山东省今年将要建设三十座洗选厂，设计年洗选能力共达一千五百九十万吨。目前已经动工和即将动工兴建的有二十二座。这些洗选厂绝大部分分布在优质焦煤产地——枣庄、官桥、新汶和肥城等矿区，其中有二十七座将在今年内移交生产。
    为了在今年上半年分期建成二十座洗选厂，山东省煤炭工业局已经设立了专门的领导机构，由局长挂帅，及时调度和检查。各个矿务局也在积极进行备料和抽调干部、工人突击洗选厂的建设。在已经开工建厂的工地上，职工们提出“加速建设洗选厂，供应钢帅好粮饷”的口号，掀起了以技术革命为中心的比速度、比质量、比安全的竞赛运动。他们采取平行交叉作业法施工，大大加快了工程进度。
    各矿务局还派出了大批工人和干部，到东北及本省的洗选厂去学习操作技术，为新建的洗选厂作好生产准备工作。
    据新华社济南20日电　山东淄博矿务局洪山煤矿洗选厂大挖设备潜力，生产更多的精煤支援武钢。这个厂在2月份提前六天半把一万五千五百多吨精煤运到武钢，受到武钢职工的赞扬；3月1日到15日，在“六比”红旗竞赛运动中又超额13.2％完成上半月的洗选计划，并且继续支援武钢七千三百多吨精煤。
    这个厂今年担负着供应武钢二十万吨精煤的任务，厂内设备的原设计年产能力也只有二十万吨。但是，为了给武钢洗选更多更好的煤；职工们千方百计地挖掘设备潜力，把年产能力加大到六十万吨。同时，采取层层设闸、包干负责的办法，每隔半小时就作一次浮沉取样化验，坚决不让矸石过“关”，从而使精煤达到了武钢要求的质量标准。
