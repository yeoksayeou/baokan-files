　　Zhejiang Spring Crops Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest
　　In Zhejiang Province, the more than ten million mu of spring crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans are growing better than in any previous year. Most of the wheat and rapeseed have full and strong seedlings, good tillering, and are growing robustly, with first-class and second-class seedlings accounting for about 80%. In order to strive for high yields per mu, all parts of the province are currently strengthening field management and eliminating third-class seedlings. To this end, field inspections and field consultations of spring crops have been widely carried out, and measures such as separate management by plot and applying fertilizer according to seedling conditions have been adopted.

　　Anhui Green Manure Grows Vigorously
　　In Anhui Province this year, green manure crops were planted with the same care as oil crops, including fertilization, ditching, drainage, and covering with grass to prevent frost. As a result, autumn-sown green manure crops generally emerged completely and are growing vigorously. It is estimated that the average yield of fresh grass per mu will be 4,000-5,000 catties. At present, while actively strengthening field management of green manure crops, various methods are also being adopted throughout the province to intercrop short-term green manure within summer harvest crops to fully meet the needs of base fertilizer for spring and summer crops this year.

　　Hunan Focuses on Small Farm Tool Production
　　Hunan is focusing on the production of small farm tools. More than four million various small farm tools have been added and repaired throughout the province. More than 4,200 farm tool factories in counties and people's communes, farm tool repair stations in production brigades, and farm tool repair groups in production teams are actively repairing and manufacturing small farm tools. A large number of furnaces are also going to the countryside to provide door-to-door repair services. The province plans to ensure that every commune member has a set of small farm tools before Grain Full (around May 21st).

　　Spring Irrigation Begins in Southern Mountainous Areas of Ningxia
　　Spring irrigation has begun successively in the southern mountainous areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The Autonomous Region's Water and Electricity Bureau dispatched a channel surveying team in late February to help Hui and Han farmers survey reservoir channels, so that reservoir projects and channel excavation projects could proceed simultaneously. Currently, six medium-sized reservoirs have begun to store water. Small-scale water conservancy projects in five counties across the region are also being carried out in a scattered manner under the spirit of "repairing and irrigating at the same time."

    浙江春花丰收有望
    浙江省一千多万亩大小麦、油菜、蚕豆等春花作物生长情况比过去任何一年都好。大小麦和油菜大多苗全苗旺，分蘖良好，生长健壮，一类苗和二类苗约占80％。为了争取亩亩高产，目前全省各地都在加强田间管理，消灭三类苗，为此普遍进行了春花作物田间检查、田头会诊，采取了逐丘逐片地分别管理，看苗施肥等措施。
    安徽绿肥生长旺盛
    安徽省今年种绿肥作物像种油料作物一样，进行了施肥、挖沟、排水、盖草防冻等工作，因而秋种绿肥普遍出苗齐全，生长旺盛，预计每亩平均可收鲜草四十——五十担。目前，全省各地在积极加强绿肥作物田间管理的同时，还采取多种办法，在夏收作物内套种短期绿肥，以充分满足今年春夏季作物基肥的需要。
    湖南大抓小农具生产
    湖南大抓小农具生产。全省添置和修补的各种小农具已达四百多万件。各县、人民公社的四千二百多个农具厂、生产大队的农具修配站和小队农具的修配组，都在积极修造小农具；还有大批烘炉正在下乡上门巡回修造。全省计划在小满以前做到每个公社社员都有一套小农具。
    宁夏南部山区开始春灌
    宁夏回族自治区南部山区春灌陆续开始。自治区水电局在2月下旬派了渠道测量队，帮助回汉农民勘测水库渠道，使水库工程和开挖渠道工程同时并进。目前已有六个中型水库开始蓄水。全区五个县的小型水利工程，也在边修边灌的精神下，星罗棋布地摆开了阵势。
