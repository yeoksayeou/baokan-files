Sum up last year's experiences and do a good job in this year's Great Leap Forward
Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    1958 was a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The reason why it was able to achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward was because it earnestly implemented the general line of socialist construction.
    1959 is the second year of the three years of hard work, and it is a more important year. All construction undertakings must have a greater and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In order to complete this new and greater leap forward task, there is no doubt that the key lies in better implementing this general line of socialist construction.
    Like all parts of the country, our Anhui has rich experiences in the Great Leap Forward of various production and construction undertakings last year, especially in the mass campaign to run iron and steel. If we can sum it up comprehensively and meticulously, it will be helpful for us to better implement the general line and ensure this year's Great Leap Forward in the future. This is a huge task, and I personally have not explored it deeply enough and do not understand it enough, so I cannot take on this task. I can only write a little about my experiences with a few issues I have come into contact with on a regular basis.

      On the Issue of Overcoming Right-leaning Conservative Thinking
    This is a matter of defending the general line, and there can be no slackening at any time. Of course, only a few people have right-leaning conservative thinking. However, in last year's Great Leap Forward, this right-leaning conservative thinking still appeared with different periods and different problems. When deciding on tasks, it was "the theory of conditions only"; when the movement unfolded, it was "the theory of tension"; when there was a defect of less than one finger, it was "the theory of uneconomical"; when we compressed the air, it was "the theory of prescience"; when organizing continued leap forward, it was "the theory of peak production and exhausted potential"; on the issue of raw materials, it was dependence and waiting; and on the issue of technology, it was a lack of confidence. The problem is very obvious. If these right-leaning conservative arguments and viewpoints are not thoroughly criticized and their weapons are not removed, it will greatly hinder the implementation of the general line. We have analyzed the roots of these right-leaning conservative thoughts. One is because of different class positions, so the viewpoints are different; the other is because the ideology lags behind reality. This is not surprising, and it cannot be reversed all at once, so the attitude we have adopted is resolute criticism and continuous criticism; the methods we have adopted are six words: teach, refute, debate, watch, lead, and compare, which is a combination of practical and virtual methods. The so-called teach is to carry out socialist and communist education to improve the awareness of the broad masses of people and cadres, and not be swayed by right-leaning conservative thinking; the so-called refute is to use Marxist-Leninist theory to refute all kinds of fallacies completely, so that they have no market; the so-called debate is to debate whatever is done, and debate whatever is available, so that right-leaning conservative thinking has no place to hide; the so-called watch is to organize the masses to watch the advanced, watch the typical, and watch the exhibitions, in order to break dependence and break superstition; the so-called lead is to grasp the two ends and lead the middle, and use the advanced to lead the backward; the so-called compare is to organize competitions, mutual evaluations, and boost morale. Wherever this has been done, the ideological problem has been thoroughly resolved, and their production has developed very rapidly. In agriculture, for example, Lai'an County increased grain production by 2.3 times, with 3,410 jin of grain per person, and Jieshou County in Huaibei exceeded 1,000 jin per mu, with 3,194 jin of grain per person; Tongcheng County, with little land and a large population (only one mu per person), increased production by about one time, with 1,709 jin of grain per person. In iron smelting, for example, Hefei and Huainan have fast technological reforms, low coal consumption, and high iron production rates. In places where the ideological problem has not been well resolved, there are more problems and the results are not great. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion: earnestly, continuously, and timely overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking is a basic guarantee for implementing the general line. We should remember this experience, resolutely implement putting politics in command, strengthen political work, and strengthen ideological leadership.
  On Comprehensively Understanding the Spiritual Essence of the General Line
    This is a prerequisite for comprehensively implementing the general line, so it must first be resolved in terms of understanding. The purpose of the general line is to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. The policy for achieving this goal is the five-pronged approach and walking on two legs. These are all opposing unities, which must be comprehensively implemented. One cannot grasp one aspect while relaxing the other. More, faster, better, and more economical are a four-in-one unit that are interconnected. More and faster are based on better and more economical results, and better and more economical results are based on more and faster results. More and faster themselves include better and more economical results. Without more and faster, the results will inevitably be poor and expensive; better and more economical results themselves include more and faster results. Better is worth it, and saving saves labor and raw materials, which can increase production. Some comrades do not understand their relationship, and often have some abnormal ideas and practices, such as paying more attention to praising more and faster, and less attention to praising better and more economical; paying more attention to high-yield "satellites," and less attention to high-quality "satellites"; some people think that less and slower should be criticized, while poor and expensive can not be criticized, thinking that criticizing poor and expensive will affect more and faster. Walking on two legs is done at the same time, but there are priorities. Only by doing both can we mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, and only by doing both can we ensure the proportional development of the national economy. However, there are priorities in doing both, and it is by no means egalitarianism. Some people do not understand this principle, thinking that two hands can only catch one fish, and that engaging in industry will inevitably affect agriculture, and that it is impossible to grasp industry with one hand and agriculture with the other. Or they regard doing both as half a catty or eight taels, treating them equally, not understanding that when central enterprises and local enterprises are done at the same time, the central government should be the main focus, and not actively completing the task of upward transfer, resulting in not a national game of chess, but several games of chess; thinking that the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is not mainly based on "foreign," and not actively studying technology, resulting in technology not being improved and production not being normal. Although these phenomena are individual, they have their ideological roots, which is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the general line. Therefore, we must continue to conduct a comprehensive education on the general line. Only by removing some of the one-sidedness in propaganda work and ideological guidance can we correctly implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results and walking on two legs. Only in this way can we achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
      On Specific Arrangements and Rational Layout
    This is a deployment issue for realizing the general line. Just like fighting a war, with the correct strategy and tactics, there must also be a correct deployment to realize the strategy and tactics in order to achieve victory in the war. The content of the deployment mainly includes tasks, measures, equipment manufacturing issues, raw material issues, labor issues, and the establishment of bases. Some of these issues have been stipulated by the central government, and some also have principled instructions. Our task is to ensure the over-fulfillment of various regulations and the practical realization of principled instructions. Based on the experience of 1958, for work tasks, we must weigh the importance and urgency, distinguish the priorities, grasp the time, and arrange them properly, reliably, specifically, in stages, and in batches, and arrange them to the end, arrange them to each factory, each mine, each construction site and workshop, each production team, and each professional team; and at the same time as assigning tasks, we must explain the methods, so that everyone knows what to do and improve their sense of responsibility. Regarding measures, we should combine principle with creativity according to different regions and different conditions, and cannot copy them mechanically. For example, in iron smelting, medium-sized cities must engage in foreign production methods, and mountainous areas with iron smelting traditions can engage in indigenous production methods; for example, in deep plowing, in Huaibei, one foot to two feet can be plowed, but currently in Huainan, only about eight inches can be plowed. Regarding the manufacturing of equipment, no matter how busy, a certain amount of strength should be drawn to build simple machine tools to improve manufacturing capacity. In the manufacturing process, the main and secondary should be distinguished, and they should be completed in batches. For example, for the equipment of small foreign blast furnaces, blowers and hot blast pipes should be built first, and then water pumps and crushers should be built. Because the arrangements were made according to the urgency, although our manufacturing capacity was extremely weak, the tasks were completed on time. Regarding the shortage of raw materials, we concentrated the materials allocated by the central government for use in the main aspects, and replaced the secondary things with indigenous materials. This is a necessary measure to solve the difficulties of raw materials. For example, in building small foreign blast furnaces, bluestone was used to replace steel bars and foreign cement to build the furnace foundation, galvanized iron sheet and iron hoops were used to replace the steel plates used for the furnace belly and furnace body, improved wooden waterwheels were used to replace water pumps, and ceramic pipes were used to replace cast iron pipes. As a result, small foreign blast furnaces with a total capacity of more than 10,000 cubic meters were built one after another in this way in the case of a shortage of raw materials. Regarding the shortage of labor, the measures we have taken are to improve labor organization and eliminate idle work; strengthen technological reforms to improve labor efficiency. In rural areas, we have vigorously developed improved agricultural tools, and in factories and mines, we have gradually improved the level of mechanization, and adopted the "small foreign group" or "medium foreign group" of combining indigenous and foreign methods for newly built industries. The labor force that participated in industry and transportation last winter once reached five million, but now it has been reduced to about one million, and it can continue to be reduced in the future, so the problem of labor shortage has been initially solved. Our arrangement method is not to lower the targets because of the lack of labor and materials, but to adopt the method of tapping potential and solving difficulties to overfulfill the tasks. Regarding the layout of industrial bases, in steel production, it is carried out according to the "five on" principle, that is, establishing bases based on five conditions: raw materials, transportation, power, cadres, and technology. Practice has proved that this is appropriate, which not only solves the above-mentioned difficulties, but also accelerates the construction speed and reduces basic construction investment. Of course, not every production must meet these five conditions, but an experience should be drawn from this, that is, each production unit and each production must be rationally arranged according to specific conditions and requirements, such as a factory, a mine, a construction site, a workshop, a special zone, a county, a commune, and a production team, must have its own production layout. Agricultural production should also be rationally arranged, and each crop should be arranged according to local conditions, especially the commodity economy part, which must be arranged in a relatively concentrated manner in places with convenient transportation, because this is convenient for management, convenient for purchase, and convenient for transfer. In short, specific arrangements and rational layout are important issues to strengthen leadership, save labor and raw materials, improve output and quality, reduce costs, and ensure the normal development of production, which should be paid attention to on the entire production front.
        On Solving the Problem of Insufficient Cadres
    This is a problem that must be effectively solved in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of production. The revolutionary cause is constantly developing, and there are always not enough cadres, but this is even more prominent in the Great Leap Forward. In the past, we adopted the method of transferring cadres to solve this difficulty. During last year's mass campaign to run iron and steel, we deeply felt that the temporary transfer of cadres was time-consuming, and because it was a newly formed team, it was not easy to exert combat effectiveness and could not adapt to the needs of emergencies. Therefore, we changed this practice, that is, we did not transfer cadres from various units, but distributed the tasks from top to bottom to them. Some people disagreed with this practice, thinking that it would affect their main business. As a result, not only did it not affect their main business, but it also proved that there were many benefits: First, the various departments automatically extracted cadres to run iron and steel, with strong leadership, a high sense of responsibility, and high enthusiasm of the cadres, and the results were quick. For example, the various units directly under the province built more than 170 small foreign blast furnaces in just three months, and production was also very normal. Second, the decision to send cadres to lower levels and participate in labor was earnestly implemented, and at the same time, the policy of the whole party running industry was realized. Third, the heads and cadres of various departments have acquired knowledge of iron and steel smelting, and some have participated in running "experimental fields" and become experts. Fourth, and more significantly, the organs have become schools for training cadres, because a group of cadres were released to run iron and steel and became full-time cadres in the iron and steel industry, and new cadres were absorbed into the organs for training, continuous rotation, and continuous transfer to professional positions, which has added a way to solve the shortage of cadres in the continuous leap forward in the future. Our difficulty in lacking cadres this year is greater than last year. We must continue to adopt this method, and do not ignore our successful experience because of the so-called argument of some people that they are not doing their job properly.
          On the Issue of Technological Reform
    As has been said above, this is the most basic method to improve labor efficiency, save raw materials, and improve quality, and it must be carried out seriously. The experience of technological reform over the past year is: First, leaders must take the lead. This is not only to improve the technical level of leading cadres, but more importantly, to create a craze and increase confidence. We have found that many technicians lack the courage to reform. They are afraid of difficulties and afraid of losing face. This is of course because their views are not correct and must be strengthened, but it cannot be changed all at once. In order to make them change quickly, the best way is for the leaders to personally participate in and preside over the technological reform, in order to break their concerns. The activists among the broad masses of people are very brave and have practical knowledge, but the shortcoming is that they lack technical theory and lack a leading force, so leading cadres, the masses, and technical personnel must be "combined in three ways." In the "three-way combination," leadership is the key. If the leaders do not participate, they cannot be organized. Especially some problems require the organization of multi-faceted cooperation, and they cannot be grasped without the leaders. For example, in order to improve the efficiency of sand excavation in Dabie Mountain last winter, magnets needed to be manufactured, which required a series of things such as ceramic kilns, pressure machines and magnetic pressing molds, and ferric oxide, which could not be solved by technicians and the masses. In order to replace cast iron pipes with ceramics, it is necessary to have a relatively mechanized ceramic factory, which requires many special refractory materials, which cannot be solved by the masses and technicians. Therefore, leading cadres must personally take the lead in participating. Regarding technological reform projects, the method we have adopted is to have all parties come up with topics, discuss and decide, and then organize forces to conduct research. These projects are reviewed and decided according to the six characters of "pass," "improve," "save," "produce," "simplify," and "substitute." "Pass" is to pass the technical barrier of iron and steel, "improve" is to improve existing technology and improve the level of mechanization, "save" is to save raw materials and labor, "produce" is to produce those scarce raw materials, "simplify" is to simplify machine construction and simplify production procedures, and "substitute" is to replace scarce raw materials with substitutes. Because this practice combines current production and changes the phenomenon of being divorced from reality in the past, the enthusiasm of leaders, the masses, and technical personnel has been greatly enhanced, and the achievements have been more significant. For example, the rapid development of small foreign groups in steel production and the continuous creation of improved tools for water conservancy, agricultural production, and transportation are obvious examples. Therefore, in order to ensure this year's Great Leap Forward, I think it is necessary to further improve the spirit and practice of technological reform over the past year.
        On Vigorously Launching Mass Movements
    This is a question of whether the general line can be realized and whether the Great Leap Forward can be realized. Our province last year vigorously launched mass movements in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, fought drought, fought pests, and ran iron and steel. At present, the question of whether or not to vigorously launch mass movements for socialist construction has been resolved. The question is how to further improve and consolidate the mass movements. On the whole, our mass movements are healthy and normal. The problem is very obvious. Without vigorous and healthy mass movements, it would not be possible to achieve such a great victory of comprehensive leap forward. However, there are still some shortcomings in individual places, that is, there are still coercive orders in mobilizing the masses, the movement is not very solid, the leadership is not strong, and there is a phenomenon of "mass booming." According to our experience over the past year, in order to overcome these shortcomings, we must emphasize ideological mobilization. In ideological mobilization, while criticizing right-leaning conservative tendencies, it is more important to strengthen socialist education and communist education, especially to strengthen the education to break superstition and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, because only in this way can we lead our energy to the study. When conducting education, cadres must have the spirit of patiently persuading, and must have a democratic spirit. They must consult with the masses on everything, attract the masses to participate in management, and resolutely implement the "two participations and one reform" system. We must care about the lives of the masses and combine production with life. In particular, we must participate in labor according to the system, continue to cultivate experimental fields, and treat people with the attitude of ordinary workers, because exemplary action is the best mass education work, and it is also self-education work. Another most effective method of education work is the self-education of the masses, which is also the education of cadres. This is the big ming, big fang, and big debate. This method was "invented" by the rightists, and was also used to fight the rightists and isolate the rightists. Now we must use this form as a weapon for self-education of the masses, that is, to debate whatever there is, and to debate whatever is done, to make the ideas clear, and to clarify the truth before doing it, so that it will be done with more energy. Since last year, the soaring energy has been boosted. The current question is how to lead the energy to the study. Therefore, the competition work should strive to be comprehensive, not just to compete for energy, but more importantly, to compete for the study, to compete for creation; not just to compete for quantity, but more importantly, to compete for quality, to compete for savings, to compete for cost, to compete for overcoming difficulties, to compete for self-reliance; not just to compete for high yields in small areas, but more importantly, to compete for bumper harvests in large areas; not just to compete for bumper harvests in production, but more importantly, to compete for bumper harvests in thought. In short, we must sum up the experience of mass movements on the production front over the past year, and further consolidate and improve the movements, because only in this way can we implement the general line and ensure a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year.
          On the Issue of Centralized Leadership
    This is the question of ensuring a game of chess, the question of ensuring the rapid resolution of problems, and the question of ensuring the proper adjustment of production links. Because the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, the battle is extremely tense, because various production is closely combined, especially industrial production, which is one link after another, if there is a slight negligence, a slight improper handling, or untimely handling, there will be gaps, which will affect the progress of the entire production cause. For example, a machine, as long as a screw goes wrong, the entire machine will not be able to operate flexibly. Therefore, there must be a high degree of centralized leadership. To achieve a high degree of centralized leadership, it is of course not something that can be solved by various production departments. Even the provincial, prefectural, and county party committees can hardly concentrate all their energy on production issues, because there are other tasks and can only solve major policies and strengthen political and ideological work. According to our experience in running iron and steel on a large scale last year, under the leadership of the party committee and the government, a command headquarters was established at all levels and at each construction site, just like a command headquarters for combat, to uniformly command various production departments and various production combat troops, and to concentrate on solving various problems in production, so that all aspects of production can advance in coordination. The reason why more than one million tons of iron and tens of thousands of tons of steel were completed in just a few months last winter is closely related to the centralized command of the iron and steel command headquarters. Therefore, we believe that this year, instead of abolishing this institution, we should better improve and strengthen this combat command headquarters to better play its role. Because this year's production tasks are greater, more centralized command is needed to better ensure unified leadership and better complete the task of the Great Leap Forward.
    The above is a little bit of experience of the several main problems I have come into contact with. It may not be correct. I hope that everyone will sum up the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, and sum up the rich experience of implementing the general line, in order to guide this year's greater and more comprehensive leap forward.

    总结去年的经验，搞好今年的大跃进
    中共安徽省委第一书记  曾希圣
    1958年是全面大跃进的一年。它之所以能够全面大跃进，就是因为认真地执行了社会主义建设的总路线。
    1959年是苦战三年的第二年，是一个更重要的一年，各项建设事业都要有一个更大更全面的大跃进。为要完成这个新的更大的跃进任务，毫无疑问，关键还在于更好地贯彻执行这条建设社会主义的总路线。
    我们安徽也和全国各地一样，在去年各项生产建设事业的大跃进中，特别是在全民大办钢铁的运动中，有着丰富的经验，如果能把它全面地细致地总结起来，对于我们今后如何更好地去贯彻执行总路线、保证今年大跃进是有帮助的。这是一个巨大的工作，我个人摸得不深，了解不够，不可能担当这个任务，我只能就平时所接触到的几个问题写一点体会。
      关于克服右倾保守思想问题
    这是保卫总路线的问题，任何时候都不能有所松懈。当然，有右倾保守思想的只是少数人。但是，在去年大跃进中这种右倾保守思想，仍然随着不同时期，不同问题而出现。在决定任务时是“唯条件论”，在运动展开时是“紧张论”，在发生不到一个指头的缺点时是“不合算论”，在我们压缩空气时是“先知先觉论”，在组织继续跃进时是“增产到顶、潜力挖尽论”，在原材料问题上是依赖等待，在技术问题上是缺乏信心。问题很明显，如果对这些右倾保守论调和观点不进行彻底批判，不解除他们的武器，对总路线的贯彻执行是有很大妨碍的。我们分析了这些右倾保守思想的根源，一是由于阶级立场不同，所以观点不同；一是由于思想落后于实际。这是不足为奇的，也不是一下能够反掉了的，所以我们采取的态度是坚决的批判，不断批判；我们采取的办法是教、驳、辩、看、带、比六个字，也就是虚实并举的办法。所谓教，就是进行社会主义共产主义教育，提高广大群众和干部的觉悟，不为右倾保守思想所波动；所谓驳，就是以马列主义的理论，把形形色色的谬论驳得体无完肤，使它没有市场；所谓辩，就是做什辩什，有什辩什，使右倾保守思想没有藏身之所；所谓看，就是组织群众看先进，看典型，看展览，以打破依赖，打破迷信；所谓带，就是抓两头带中间，以先进带落后；所谓比，就是组织竞赛，互相评比，鼓起干劲。凡是这样做了的，思想问题就解决得彻底，他们的生产就发展得很快。农业方面，如来安县，粮食增产两点三倍，每人占有粮食三千四百一十斤，淮北界首县超过亩产千斤，每人占有粮食三千一百九十四斤；地少人多（每人只有一亩）的桐城县，增产约一倍，每人也占有粮食一千七百零九斤。炼铁方面，如合肥和淮南，技术改革快，煤耗低，出铁率高。凡是思想问题解决得不好的地方，他们那里的问题比较多，成绩就不大。因此，我们可以得出一个结论：认真地、不断地、及时地克服右倾保守思想，是贯彻执行总路线的基本保证。我们应该记取这个经验，坚决实现政治挂帅，加强政治工作，加强思想领导。
  关于全面地领会总路线的精神实质问题
    这是有关全面贯彻执行总路线的先决问题，所以必须首先从认识上得到解决。总路线的目的是多快好省，实现这个目的的方针是五个并举，两条腿走路。这都是对立的统一，必须全面贯彻，不能抓了这一面而放松那一面。多快好省是四位一体的，是互相联系的。多快是在好省基础上的多快，好省是以多快为前提的好省。多快本身包含有好省，不多不快，结果必然差费；好省本身包含有多快，好则顶用，省则节约劳力和原料，就能增加生产。有些同志不理解它们的关系，常常发生一些不正常的想法和做法，如多注意表扬多快，而少注意表扬好省，多重视高产“卫星”，而少重视高质“卫星”；有的人认为少慢应该批判，而差费可以不批判，认为批判了差费就会影响多快。两条腿走路是同时并举的，而又是有重点的。只有并举才能调度各方面的积极性，也只有并举，才能保证国民经济按比例发展。但并举中有缓急轻重，绝不是平均主义。有的人不理解这个道理，认为两只手只能揪一条鱼，搞了工业必然影响农业，不能一手抓工业，一手抓农业。或者把并举当成半斤八两，等量齐观，不了解中央企业和地方企业同时并举应当以中央为主，不积极完成上调任务，结果不是全国一盘棋，而是几盘棋；以为土洋并举不是以“洋”为主，不积极钻研技术，结果技术提不高，生产不正常。这些现象虽然是个别的，但是有其思想根源的，这就是对总路线缺乏全面理解的原故。因此，我们还必须继续地全面地进行一次总路线的教育，只有在宣传工作方面和思想指导方面去掉某些片面性，才能正确贯彻多快好省、两条腿走路的方针。也只有如此，才能实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
      关于具体安排、合理布局问题
    这是实现总路线的部署问题。正如作战一样，有了正确的战略战术，还需有实现战略战术的正确部署，才能取得战争的胜利。部署的内容主要是任务、措施问题，设备制造问题，原材料问题，劳动力问题，基地的建立问题。这些问题有的已经中央作了规定，有的也有原则指示。我们的任务是保证各项规定的超额完成和原则指示的切实实现。根据1958年的经验，对于工作任务，必须权衡轻重缓急，分别先后，掌握时间，妥善地可靠地具体地分期分批地安排，而且要安排到底，安排到每个厂矿、每个工地和车间、每个生产队和专业队；并且在交代任务的同时交代办法，使大家心中有数，以提高他们的责任心。关于措施，应根据不同地区，不同条件，把原则性与创造性结合起来，不能生搬硬套。如炼铁，在中等城市必须搞洋法生产，在山区而又有炼铁传统的地区，可以搞土法生产；如深耕，在淮北可耕一尺到二尺，目前在淮南只能耕八寸左右。关于设备的制造，不管如何忙迫，应抽出一定的力量大造简易机床，以提高制造能力。在制造程序上，则应分清主要与次要，一批一批地突击完成。如对小洋高炉的设备，先造鼓风机和热风管，再造水泵和破碎机。由于按照轻重缓急进行安排，虽然我们的制造能力极为薄弱，但任务也按时完成了。对于原材料的不足，我们把中央调给的材料集中使用于主要方面，把次要的东西用土材料代替，这是解决原材料困难的一个必须采取的办法。如建小洋高炉，以青石代替钢筋、洋灰打炉基，以白铁皮加铁箍代替炉腹和炉缸用的钢板，以改良木制水车代替水泵，以陶瓷管代替铸铁管，结果，容量共达一万多立方公尺的小洋高炉，就是这样的在原材料缺乏的情况下陆续建设起来了。对于劳动力的不足，我们采取的办法是改善劳动组织，消除窝工；加强技术改革，以提高劳动效率。在农村大搞改良农具，在厂矿逐步提高机械化程度，对新建工业采取土洋结合的“小洋群”或“中洋群”。我们去冬参加工业、交通运输的劳动力曾一度达到五百万，现在已减少到一百万左右，今后还可继续减少，从而劳动力不足的问题也就初步解决了。我们的安排办法不是因为劳力和材料的不足而降低指标，而是采取挖掘潜力、解决困难来超额完成任务的。关于工业基地的布局，在钢铁生产中，是按“五就”原则进行的，即就原料、就交通运输、就动力、就干部、就技术等五个条件建立基地。这样做证明是适当的，不仅解决了上述困难，而且加快了建设速度，减少了基本建设投资。当然，不是每一种生产都要合乎这五个条件，但应由此得出一个经验，就是每一个生产单位、每一种生产都要根据具体条件和要求进行合理布局，如一个厂矿、一个工地、一个车间、一个专区、一个县、一个公社、一个生产队，均要有自己的生产布局。农业生产也要合理布局，每一种农作物都要按当地条件进行安排，特别是商品经济部分，必须比较集中地安排在交通运输便利的地方，因为这样才便于管理，便于收购，便于调拨。总之，具体安排、合理布局是加强领导，节约劳力、原料，提高产量、质量，降低成本，保证生产正常发展的重要问题，在整个生产战线上都要引起注意。
        关于解决干部不足的问题
    这是生产全面大跃进中必须切实解决的问题。革命事业是不断发展的，干部是经常不够的，但在大跃进中则显得更为突出。在以前我们是采取抽调干部的办法，来解决这个困难的。在去年大办钢铁时，我们深深感到临时抽调干部既费时间，又因为是新组成的班子，不易发挥战斗力，不能适应紧急情况的需要，因而改变了这种做法，就是不向各个单位抽调干部，而将任务从上而下的分配给他们。有些人不同意这种做法，认为会影响正业。结果不仅没有影响正业，而且证明好处很多：第一，由各个部门自动抽出干部去办钢铁，领导强，责任心大，干部积极性高，收效快。如省直各单位在短短三个月中间，即建成一百七十多个小洋高炉，生产也很正常。第二，认真地执行了干部下放，干部参加劳动的决定，同时也实现了全党办工业的方针。第三，各部门的负责人和干部都有了炼钢铁的知识，有的参加办“试验田”，成了专家。第四，更有意义的是把机关变成了培养干部的学校，因为放出一批干部办钢铁，成为钢铁工业的专职干部，又吸收新的干部到机关培养，不断轮训，不断转到专业，就为今后不断跃进中增加了一条解决干部不足的门路。我们今年干部缺乏的困难大过于去年，我们要继续采取这个办法，不要因为某些人所谓不务正业的论调，而忽视我们的成功经验。
          关于技术改革问题
    在上面已经说过，这是提高劳动效率、节约原材料、提高质量的最基本办法，必须认真进行。一年来对于技术改革的体会是：首先要领导带头。这不仅是为了提高领导干部的技术水平，而更重要的是在于造成热潮，提高信心。我们发现许多技术人员对于改革问题是缺乏勇气的。他们怕困难，怕丢面子。这固然由于他们的观点不对头，必须加强教育，但也不是一下可以转变的。要使他们迅速改变过来，最好的办法是领导亲自参加和主持技术改革，才能打破他们的顾虑。广大群众中的积极分子是很勇敢的，而且有实际知识，但缺点是缺乏技术理论，缺乏主持力量，所以必须领导干部、群众、技术人员“三结合”。在“三结合”中，领导是关键，领导人员不参加是组织不起来的。特别是有一些问题，还需要组织多方面协作，没有领导人员来抓，是抓不起来的。譬如，去冬为了提高大别山的掏砂效率而制造磁铁，就需要有瓷窑、压力机和压磁模子、氧化铁等一系列的东西，这都不是技术人员和群众所能解决的。为了以陶瓷代替铸铁管，就需要有一个比较机械化的陶瓷工厂，需要有许多特殊的耐火材料，这更不是群众和技术人员所能解决的。所以必须领导干部亲自带头参加。关于技术改革项目，我们采取的办法是由各方面出题目，经过讨论决定，再组织力量进行研究。这些项目是按“过”、“提”、“节”、“产”、“简”、“代”六个字来审查决定的。“过”是过钢铁技术关，“提”是提高现有技术，提高机械化程度，“节”是节约原材料和劳力，“产”是生产那些缺少的原材料，“简”是简化机器构造，简化生产程序，“代”是把缺少的原材料改用代用品。由于这种做法结合了当前生产，改变了过去脱离实际的现象，因而领导、群众、技术人员的积极性都大为增强，取得的成绩也就比较显著。如钢铁生产的小洋群迅速发展，水利、农业生产、交通运输等改良工具的不断创造，都是明显的例子。因此，为了保证今年的大跃进，我认为必须把一年来的技术改革的精神和做法再进一步地加以提高。
        关于大搞群众运动问题
    这是总路线能不能实现的问题，大跃进能不能实现的问题。我省去年大搞水利、积肥，大战干旱，大战虫害，大办钢铁，都是轰轰烈烈地大搞群众运动。目前对于社会主义建设要不要大搞群众运动的问题已经解决，问题在于如何把群众运动更加提高和巩固。整个来说，我们的群众运动是健康的，正常的。问题很明显，没有轰轰烈烈而又健康的群众运动，就不可能取得如此全面跃进的伟大胜利。但也有个别地方还存在一些缺点，就是在发动群众中还有强迫命令，运动还不很踏实，领导不强，有“大呼隆”的现象。根据我们一年来的经验，要克服这些缺点，必须强调思想发动，在思想发动中固然要批判右倾保守倾向，但更重要的是加强社会主义教育和共产主义教育，特别是要加强破除迷信的教育，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，因为只有如此，才能把干劲引向钻劲。进行教育时干部要有耐心说服的精神，要有民主精神，遇事要与群众商量，要吸引群众参加管理，坚决贯彻“两参一改”的制度。要关心群众生活，把生产与生活结合起来。特别要按制度规定参加劳动，要继续种试验田，要以普通劳动者的态度对人，因为模范行动是最好的群众教育工作，也是自我教育工作。教育工作的另一个最有效的方法是群众的自我教育，也是对干部的教育。这就是大鸣、大放、大辩论。这种方法是右派“发明”的，也以此斗争了右派，孤立了右派，现在我们要利用这种形式，作为群众的自我教育武器，即有什辩什，做什辩什，把思想搞通，把真理弄明再去做，这样就做得更有劲。从去年以来，冲天的干劲已经鼓起来了，目前是如何把干劲引向钻劲。因此，竞赛工作要力求全面，不是单比干劲，而更重要的是比钻劲，比创造；不单比数量，而更重要的是比质量，比节约，比成本，比克服困难，比自力更生；不单是比小面积高产，而更重要的是比大面积丰收；不单是比生产大丰收，而更重要的是比思想大丰收。总之，我们要把一年来在生产战线上的群众运动经验总结起来，把运动更加巩固和提高，因为，只有如此才能贯彻实行总路线，才能保证今年更大更全面的跃进。
          关于集中领导问题
    这是保证一盘棋的问题，是保证问题的迅速解决，保证生产环节的妥善调整的问题。因为全面大跃进，战斗是极为紧张的，因为各种生产是密切结合的，特别工业生产，是一环套一环的，如果稍有疏忽，稍一处理不当，或者处理不及时，就会发生空隙，就会影响整个生产事业的前进。譬如一部机器，只要一个螺丝钉出了毛病，就会使全部机器不能灵活运转。因此必须高度的集中领导。要达到高度的集中领导，固然不是各个生产部门所能解决，就是省、地、县三级党委也很难把全部精力集中在生产问题上，因为还有其他工作，只能解决大政方针，加强政治思想工作。根据我们去年大办钢铁的经验，是在党委和政府的领导下，成立各级、各工地的指挥部，好像作战的指挥部一样，统一指挥各生产部门，各个生产的战斗部队，聚精会神地解决生产的各个问题，使各方面的生产协同前进。去冬在短短的几个月中间之所以能够完成百多万吨铁，十几万吨钢，与钢铁指挥部的集中指挥是有密切关系的。因此，我们认为，今年不是撤销这个机构，而是更好改善和加强这个战斗性的指挥部，使它更好地发挥作用。因为今年生产任务更大，更需要集中指挥，才能更好地保证统一领导，才能更好地完成大跃进的任务。
  以上是我接触到的几个主要问题的一点体会，不一定正确，希望大家把去年大跃进的丰富经验总结起来，把贯彻执行总路线的丰富经验总结起来，以指导今年的更大更全面的跃进。
