    Some young people don't pay much attention to reading. They think that book knowledge is divorced from reality, and that it's better to participate more in labor and practice to learn real knowledge. This view is one-sided. It is certainly correct to participate more in labor and practice in order to learn knowledge comprehensively. However, learning knowledge cannot be limited to participating in labor and practice. We should both participate in labor and practice, and study book knowledge at the same time. We should read extensively. In addition to mainly reading books on Marxism-Leninism, we can also read books with bourgeois viewpoints. We should adopt the attitude of "discarding the dross and selecting the essence" towards the latter, absorbing the useful parts and discarding the useless and incorrect parts. Even poison weeds can be used as "fertilizer." Didn't Marx extensively consult and read the relevant works of bourgeois scholars when he wrote "Das Kapital"?

    Some young students only want to study specialized courses and do not value studying basic courses. They believe that specialized courses are more closely related to practice, while basic courses are not useful. In the previous period, some places even advocated abolishing basic courses. These views are incorrect. Science itself has its system. Basic courses are disciplines that reflect the general laws of a science. They not only prepare the necessary basic knowledge for studying specialized courses, but also enable students to have a comprehensive and unified understanding of the entire material world and a certain discipline, which is extremely important for cultivating students' dialectical materialist world outlook and methodology, and for students to master and develop professional knowledge. It is undoubtedly right to continue carrying out academic criticism in schools. The question now is how to do this work better. Here, we should further clarify that academic criticism is a matter of the nature of contradictions among the people. Therefore, free debate should be conducted, and people with different opinions should be allowed to speak. This way, the truth becomes clearer as it is debated. This can not only truly convince the other party and clarify their thinking, which is conducive to their ideological transformation, but also enable us to clarify the problem, truly gain from the debate, and increase our academic talents. At the same time, it can also enable our schools to truly form a lively situation, which is conducive to improving teaching and academic standards in the future. We should not be afraid of the other party speaking. There are only two possibilities when the other party speaks: one is that they do not accept our correct opinions and launch a counterattack. This puts forward new tasks for us, prompting us to conduct the debate more deeply and comprehensively, and the criticism will be more thorough. The other is that there are correct opinions or correct facts in the other party's rebuttal. We should accept correct things, which is beneficial and harmless to us. In academic criticism, we must have an attitude of seeking truth from facts and being kind to others.

    If we want to read, we must have teachers to guide us. Now, in addition to a few teachers, many teachers still have a certain amount of knowledge. Teachers are still more knowledgeable than students in terms of the total amount of knowledge. Therefore, schools must give play to the role of teachers, and students should humbly learn from teachers. Teachers "impart knowledge, teach skills, and resolve doubts" to students, and students should respect teachers. Of course, this does not mean that students cannot criticize teachers. So-called criticism is mutual help. Generally speaking, teachers certainly have more knowledge than students, but this does not mean that teachers are better than students in everything. Confucius said: "When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers." Han Yu's "Teacher Says" also has such words: "Those who were born before me knew the truth earlier than I did, and I follow them and learn from them. Those who were born after me also knew the truth earlier than I did, and I follow them and learn from them. I learn the truth, why should I care whether they were born before or after me? Therefore, regardless of status, regardless of age, where the truth lies, there lies the teacher." From this, it can be seen that the ancients also advocated mutual learning and teaching each other.

### 认真读书　虚心学习

    认真读书　虚心学习
    有的青年不大重视读书，他们认为书本知识都是脱离实际的，不如多参加劳动，从事实践，还可以学得真正的知识。这种看法是片面的。多参加劳动，从事实践，以便全面地学得知识，这当然是正确的。但学习知识不能只限于参加劳动。从事实践，同时也要学习书本知识。我们应该博览群书，除了主要读有关马列主义的书，也可以读带有资产阶级观点的书。对后者，要采取“弃其糟粕，取其精华”的态度，吸取其中有用的部分，丢掉其无用和不正确的部分。即使是毒草，也可以当作“肥料”。马克思当年著“资本论”不就是旁征博览，遍读了资产阶级学者有关的著述吗？
    还有的青年学生在学习中只愿学专业课，不重视学习基础课。他们认为专业课比较能联系实际，而基础课学了用不上；在前一时期，甚至有的地方出现了取消基础课的主张。这些看法是不正确的。科学本身有它的体系。基础课是反映一门科学的一般规律的学科，它不仅为学习专业课准备必要的基础知识，而且使学生对整个物质世界和某一门学科有全面的统一的理解，对培养学生辩证唯物主义的世界观和思想方法，对于学生掌握和发展专业知识，有极重要的意义。在学校中继续开展学术批判，是无疑的。现在问题是要如何把这项工作搞得更好。在这里，我们应该进一步明确，学术批判是属于人民内部矛盾性质的问题。因此应该进行自由辩论，应该让各种不同意见的人讲话。这样真理越辩越明；既可以使对方真正口服心服，搞通思想，有利于他们的思想改造；也可以使我们弄清问题，通过辩论真正得到收获，并增长自己的学术才干；同时也可以使我们学校真正形成生动活泼的局面，有利于今后的教学和学术水平的提高。我们不要害怕对方说话，对方说话不外出现这两种情况：一种是不接受我们的正确意见，进行反攻。这就给我们提出了新的任务，促使我们把辩论搞得更深刻更全面，而批判也会更彻底。另一种是在对方反驳中还有正确的意见或正确的事实。正确的东西我们就应该接受，这对我们是有利而无害的。在学术批判中，我们一定要有实事求是、与人为善的态度。
    我们要读书就得有老师来指导。现在，除了少数教师外，不少的教师还是有一定的学识的。教师在知识的总量上，还高出于学生。因此，学校必须发挥教师的作用，学生还应当虚心向教师学习。教师对学生“传道、授业、解惑”，学生就应该尊敬教师。当然这也不是说，学生就不能批评教师。所谓批评就是互相帮助。一般的讲，教师固然比学生的知识要多些，但也不能因此认为教师什么都比学生强。孔子说：“三人行必有我师焉”，韩愈的“师说”也有这样的话：“生乎吾前，其闻道也，固先乎吾，吾从而师之；生乎吾后，其闻道也，亦先乎吾，吾从而师之。吾师道也，夫庸知其年之先后生于吾乎？是故无贵无贱，无长无少，道之所存，师之所存也。”由此可见，古人也是提倡互相学习，教学相长的。
