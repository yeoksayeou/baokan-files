Which Minerals Can Be Used as Chemical Raw Materials?
　　Chuān Liú

　　The chemical industry is a very important industry. It can turn the decayed into the miraculous and the useless into the useful. However, "even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Like many other industries, it still needs raw materials to produce. However, the sources of raw materials are particularly wide. It can be water from the sea, air from the sky, or organisms from the ground, and the earth's mineral deposits are an important source.

　　Which minerals can be used as chemical raw materials?

　　　　　　Coal

　　First is coal. The main component of coal is carbon, and carbon is the basis of all organic matter. Therefore, the organic chemical industry is inseparable from carbon and its compounds. The carbon we need is mainly obtained from the earth. The carbon content in the earth's crust is more than 6,500 times that of carbon in organisms, and more than 2,000 times that of carbon in the air. Coal is a concentrated warehouse of carbon in the earth's crust. Coal not only contains carbon, but also often contains various carbon compounds and a small amount of nitrogen compounds. Therefore, the coal tar, coke, and coal gas obtained after coal is dry-distilled are widely used in the chemical industry. Coal tar contains many carbon compounds (benzene, toluene, phenol, cresol, naphthalene, anthracene), which can be used as basic materials to produce ever-changing products, such as light, transparent, and tough plastics, thin, long, and soft artificial fibers, saccharin that is more than 500 times sweeter than sugar, perfume that is more fragrant than roses, and dyes that are more beautiful and diverse than rainbows. Explosives, rubber, paint, preservatives, commonly used aspirin, 666 insecticide powder and other medicines, and many other things can be made from materials extracted from coal tar. Coal gas also contains a large number of basic raw materials for the organic chemical synthesis industry, which can be used to produce formaldehyde, methanol, acetylene (calcium carbide gas), carbon black, etc. Formaldehyde and methanol are both raw materials for manufacturing plastics, carbon black is an important filler in rubber, and acetylene, after further processing and transformation, can also be used to make various products such as plastics, artificial fibers, and rubber. Therefore, in addition to being used as a reducing agent in the metallurgical industry, coke is also used as a reducing agent in the chemical industry. Burning coke and lime together can turn it into calcium carbide, which is an important source for obtaining calcium carbide gas. Coke is also used in the manufacture of chemical products such as yellow phosphorus, carbon disulfide, and sodium sulfide. In addition to these carbon and carbon compounds, ammonia can often be obtained during the dry distillation of coal, and ammonia is a raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and nitric acid.

　　Therefore, coal is not only an important fuel, but also an important chemical raw material. China has large coal reserves and a wide distribution. Coal has been discovered in more than half of the counties in the country, which provides favorable conditions for the whole people to run the chemical industry. In addition to coal, peat (the predecessor of coal) also contains a lot of carbon, while petroleum, natural gas, and oil shale contain a large number of hydrocarbons. They are also important raw materials for the chemical industry. In particular, natural gas and oil shale are extremely abundant in our country and deserve great attention.

　　　　　　Salt

　　Another important type of mineral used as a chemical raw material is salt mines. Salt mines contain many salt substances, the most abundant of which is table salt. In addition to being eaten, table salt is also a raw material for manufacturing soda ash (sodium carbonate), caustic soda, and hydrochloric acid. Acids and alkalis are the foundation of the chemical industry, so table salt occupies a very important position in the chemical industry. Chlorine gas and metallic sodium can also be extracted from table salt. Table salt is a compound of these two substances. Chlorine gas can sterilize and disinfect, and manufacture bleaching powder and many chemical products, while metallic sodium is often used to promote certain chemical changes and becomes an important catalyst in the chemical industry. It can also separate certain rare or difficult-to-extract metals from their oxides and becomes a reducing agent in the metallurgical industry.

　　Salt is concentrated in dry salt lakes on the mainland or buried in underground rock layers, becoming a usable mineral. These naturally produced ores often contain many other salts, such as potash (a compound of potassium and chlorine), carnallite (a compound of potassium, magnesium, and chlorine), kainite (potassium and magnesium sulfate), mirabilite, epsom salt, borax, gypsum, natural alkali, etc. The first three minerals are the main source of potassium we get today, and important raw materials for manufacturing potash fertilizers. Many potassium-containing chemical products also need them for manufacturing.

　　If we comprehensively utilize salt mines, we can also obtain many important and useful by-products such as bromine, iodine, lithium, strontium, rubidium, cesium, barium and other elements or their compounds. Therefore, comprehensive utilization of salt resources is a direction in our work.

　　　　Borax

　　It is worth mentioning borax. In addition to being used in the pottery and pharmaceutical industries, it is now also a source of high-energy fuel borohydride, so borax is much more important than before.

　　　　Sulfur

　　Another important raw material in the chemical industry, sulfur, is also taken from the earth. Sulfur is a raw material for manufacturing sulfuric acid and other sulfides. Some of it exists alone in nature, but more of it forms various sulfides, among which the compound of iron and sulfur, pyrite, contains a lot of sulfur and is easy to find, becoming the main source of sulfur. More than half of the world's sulfur production comes from pyrite. In fact, not only pyrite, but also many other metal ores such as chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, stibnite, etc. also contain sulfur. In the past, we only paid attention to extracting metals and let the sulfur run away for nothing. Therefore, it is very important to pay attention to the recovery of tail gas during smelting. The recovered sulfur can be used to make sulfuric acid, and sulfuric acid is the foundation of the chemical industry.

　　　　Phosphorus

　　Speaking of sulfur, we cannot fail to think of phosphorus, which is also mainly taken from the earth. It exists in minerals such as apatite, phosphate rock, and guano stone. These minerals become the main source of phosphate fertilizer, and phosphorus can also be extracted from them and various useful phosphates can be manufactured. Phosphorus is indispensable for making matches. It and its compounds are widely used in the manufacture of plastics, medicine, coatings, etc. China's Xisha Islands are world-famous guano stone producing areas, and huge phosphate mines have been discovered in many places on the mainland, such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Jiangsu.

　　　Limestone, Fluorite………

　　In the field of the chemical industry, we can also see that limestone, fluorite, alunite, chromite, etc. are also important raw materials. We know that lime is used to make calcium carbide, and lime is made by burning limestone. Lime is used in sugar making, alkali making, leather making and other industries, and can also be used as an alkaline fertilizer. In addition to being used in the metallurgical industry, fluorite is also the main source of fluorine and fluorine compounds. Fluorine is a chemically active element. It and its compounds can be used as corrosives, insecticides, and wood preservatives. In particular, it has recently been used to make plastics with particularly excellent properties, as an oxidizing agent in rocket fuel, and to separate uranium isotopes, which can produce atomic explosive uranium after concentration.

　　Alunite is a sulfate of aluminum and potassium. In addition to its water purification effect, it is also useful in the leather making and textile industries. In addition, when potassium and aluminum resources are insufficient, potassium and aluminum can also be extracted from it. In addition to being used in the metallurgical industry, chromite is also a raw material for manufacturing pigments and manufacturing chromium-containing chemical products. These products are used in leather making, printing and dyeing, medicine, etc.

　　If we list them one by one, there are many chemical industry raw materials in the earth's crust. For example, barite and talc for manufacturing coatings and fillers, niter for manufacturing fertilizers, ocher (hematite), azurite, malachite for manufacturing pigments, realgar, orpiment and many other minerals for manufacturing medicines. Originally, the earth's crust is a treasure trove of chemical elements. On average, every billion cubic meters of rock contains 62.4 million tons of sodium, 31.2 million tons of phosphorus, 2.6 million tons of sulfur, and 260,000 tons of boron... 58.1% of the rocks that make up the earth's crust are feldspar, which contains a large amount of potassium and sodium. In the past, it was not very useful, but now some places in our country have made potassium-containing feldspar into fertilizer, just as Engels taught us: "Nature provides labor with materials, and labor transforms materials into wealth." In our socialist country, it will definitely be as the poet sings: "Amazing miracles are commonly seen, and the ground is full of inexhaustible treasures."

    哪些矿产可作化工原料？
    川流
    化学工业是一项非常重要的工业，它能化腐朽为神奇，变无用为有用，但是“巧妇难为无米之炊”，它和其他许多工业一样，仍然要有了原料才能生产，不过原料的来源特别广泛，可以是大海里的水、可以是空中的气、也可以是地上的生物，而大地里的矿藏更是一个重要的来源。
    有哪些矿产可以作为化工原料呢？
                煤
    首先是煤。煤的主要成分是碳，而碳是一切有机物的基础，因此有机化学工业简直离不开碳及其化合物，我们要的碳，主要向大地索取，地壳中碳的含量比生物中碳的含量要多六千五百多倍，比空气中碳的含量大两千倍以上，煤就是地壳中碳素集中的仓库，煤里不仅含有碳，还常常含有各种碳的化合物以及少量氮的化合物，因此将煤干馏以后，得到的煤焦油、焦炭、煤气都被广泛应用在化学工业中；煤焦油中含有许多碳的化合物（苯、甲苯、酚、甲酚、萘、蒽），用它们作为基本材料，可以制出千变万化的产品，像轻巧透明而坚韧的塑料、又细又长又软的人造纤维、比糖还甜五百多倍的糖精、比玫瑰还要香的香水、比虹彩还要美丽多样的染料。而炸药、橡胶、油漆、防腐剂、常用的阿斯匹灵、六六六杀虫粉等药品以及其他许多东西，都可以用煤焦油中提炼出来的材料制成。在煤气中也含有大量有机化学合成工业的基本原料，能够制出甲醛、甲醇、乙炔（电石气）、碳黑等，甲醛、甲醇都是制造塑料的原料，碳黑是橡胶中的重要填充料，而乙炔在进一步加工变化以后，又可以造出塑料、人造纤维、橡胶等各种产品，因此，焦炭除了在冶金工业中用作还原剂以外，在化学工业中也用来作为还原剂。将焦炭和石灰放在一起烧，就能变成电石，电石是取得电石气的一个重要来源，在制造黄磷、二硫化碳、硫化碱等化学产品时，也都要用焦炭。除开这些碳和碳的化合物外，在干馏煤时还常常可以得到氨，而氨是制造肥料以及硝酸的原料。
    因此，煤不仅是重要的燃料，还是重要的化工原料，我国的煤储量多，分布广，全国一半以上县份都发现了煤，这就为全民办化学工业提供了有利的条件。除开煤以外，泥炭（是煤的前身）含碳也很多，石油、天然气、油页岩则含有大量碳氢化合物，它们也是化学工业的重要原料，特别是天然气和油页岩在我国极其丰富，很值得重视。
              盐
    作为化工原料的另外一类重要矿产是盐矿。盐矿中包含的盐类物质很多，其中最多的是食盐，食盐除了吃，还是制造纯碱（苏打）、烧碱、盐酸的原料，酸碱是化学工业的基础，因此食盐在化学工业中占有非常重要的地位。从食盐中还可提取氯气和金属钠，食盐就是这两种物质的化合物氯气可以杀菌消毒、制造漂白粉以及许多化学产品，而金属钠则常用来促进某些化学的变化，成为化学工业中的重要催化剂，还可以使某些稀有或不易提取的金属从它们的氧化物中分离出来，成为冶金工业中的还原剂。
    盐在大陆上集中在干燥的盐湖里或是埋在地下的岩层中，成为可以利用的矿产，这些天然产出的矿石里往往还含有其他许多盐类，如钾盐（钾和氯的化合物）、光卤石（钾、镁和氯的化合物）、杂卤石（钾、镁的硫酸盐）、芒硝、泻盐、硼砂、石膏、天然碱等。前面三种矿物是今天我们得到钾的主要来源，制造钾肥的重要原料。许多含钾的化学产品也要用它们来制造。
    如果将盐矿加以综合利用，我们还可以得到许多重要的有用的副产品如溴、碘、锂、锶、铷、铯、钡等元素或它们的化合物，因此综合利用盐业资源是我们工作中的一个方向。
            硼　砂
    值得一提的还有硼砂，它除了用在窑业和医药工业，现在还是高能量的燃料硼化氢的来源，因此硼砂比从前就重要得多了。
            硫　磺
    化学工业中又一项重要的原料——硫磺，也是取之于大地，硫磺是制造硫酸和其他硫化物的原料，自然界中有一部分单独存在的，但更多的是形成各种硫化物，其中以铁和硫的化合物、黄铁矿含硫多，容易找到，成为硫的主要来源，全世界生产的硫有一半以上来自黄铁矿。其实不仅是黄铁矿，其他许多金属矿如黄铜矿、方铅矿、闪锌矿、辉锑矿等也都含有硫，过去我们只注意提炼金属，把硫白白给放跑了。因此注意回收冶炼时的尾气非常重要，用回收来的硫能制出硫酸，硫酸又是化学工业的基础。
              磷
    谈到硫，我们不能不想到磷，它也是主要取之于大地的，它存在于磷灰石、磷块岩、鸟粪石等矿藏中，这些矿藏成为磷肥的主要来源，还可以从中提取磷及制造各种有用的磷酸盐。磷是制造火柴所不可少的，它和它的化合物在制造塑料、医药、涂料等方面有广泛的用途。我国的西沙群岛是世界闻名的鸟粪石产地，而大陆上许多地方如四川，云南、江苏都有巨大的磷矿被发现。
        石灰岩、萤石………
    在化学工业的领域里，我们还可以看到石灰岩、萤石、明矾石、铬铁矿等也都是重要的原料。我们知道，制造电石要用石灰，而石灰是石灰岩烧成的，石灰在制糖、制碱、制革等工业中都有应用，还可以用来作为碱性肥料。萤石除了在冶金工业中应用外，还是我们取得氟和氟的化合物的主要来源，氟是一种化学活动性很强的元素，它和它的化合物可以作腐蚀剂、杀虫剂、木材防腐剂，特别在最近还用它制成了性能特别优良的塑料，在火箭燃料中作为氧化剂，并被用来分离铀的同位素，浓缩后能够产生原子爆炸的铀。
    明矾石是铝和钾的硫酸盐，它除了有净水的功效外，在制革、纺织工业中也有用，另外当钾、铝的资源不足时还可从中提取钾、铝。铬铁矿除了在冶金工业中应用外，还是制造颜料以及制造含铬的化学制品的原料，这些制品在制革、印染、医药等方面都有应用。
  如果一一列举起来，地壳中的化学工业原料还很多，譬如制造涂料和填充料的重晶石、滑石，制造肥料的硝石，制造颜料的赭石（赤铁矿）石青、孔雀石，制造药品的雄黄、雌黄等许多矿物。本来，地壳就是一个化学元素的聚宝盆，平均每十亿公方的岩石中就含有钠六千二百四十万吨、磷三千一百二十万吨、硫二百六十万吨、硼二十六万吨……。组成地壳的岩石中有58.1％是长石，其中便含有大量钾、钠，过去用处不多，如今我国有的地方已将含钾的长石制成肥料，正如恩格斯所教导我们的：“自然界提供劳动以材料，而劳动则把材料变为财富。”在我们社会主义国家里，一定会如诗人所唱出的：“惊人奇迹寻常见，满地浑金无尽藏。”
