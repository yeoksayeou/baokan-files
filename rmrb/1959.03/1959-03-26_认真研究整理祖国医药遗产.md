    Conscientiously Study and Organize the Heritage of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Qian Xinzhong
    Traditional Chinese medicine is the crystallization of the struggle against diseases by the Chinese working people over thousands of years. We have thousands of medical works and many folk prescriptions and secret recipes scattered among the people, all of which are the summaries of the experiences of our working people and past generations of medical scientists in treating, observing, and analyzing diseases. They contain many valuable things and are a "great treasure trove." We should study it well, organize it, and raise it to the level of modern science. This is the responsibility of all our health workers.
    In the past few years, the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine has achieved great victories. Especially since the rectification movement in 1957, the political consciousness of health workers has been universally raised, and they have a further understanding of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, basically reversing the ideas of belittling and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine. A wave of learning and applying traditional Chinese medicine has emerged, and the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine have been greatly strengthened. The valuable experience of traditional Chinese medicine has been universally valued, and the enthusiasm of health workers to study and organize the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine has been rising, and there have been many good beginnings. For example, Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Beijing Medical College and other units recently held an academic conference on the use of traditional Chinese medicine methods to treat appendicitis, found some rules, and initially summarized the indications for the three treatment methods of acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and surgery. At present, they are continuing to study early diagnostic methods for indications, so as to be able to master various different methods and more effectively treat appendicitis with different degrees of lesions. Another example is Shanghai First Medical College and other units, under the close cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, conducted systematic analysis and research on effective methods for treating various tumors across the country, absorbed the advantages of various prescriptions, and made a kind of "tumor-reducing pill" and attached prescriptions for tumors in different parts. The results of trial use on more than 90 patients showed that the effect on esophageal cancer was the most significant, and the treatment of lung cancer and cervical cancer also had considerable effects. This new trend of valuing traditional Chinese medicine is almost all over the country. Therefore, it is time to propose the work of conscientiously studying and organizing the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine. Systematically research, analyze, organize, and improve the rich experiences scattered in various places to find their regularity, explain their theories and mechanisms of action, enrich the content of medical science, and make traditional Chinese medicine serve the people's health more widely. This is the sacred task of all our health workers, especially medical and scientific workers.
    Based on China's specific historical conditions and scientific level, I think the methods and requirements for studying and organizing the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine can be considered as follows.
    The research on traditional Chinese medicine should be carried out from three main aspects:
    First, study the role and mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment methods that have special curative effects on certain diseases. The etiology of these diseases has been confirmed by modern science, such as appendicitis, stones, deafness, polio, thromboangiitis obliterans, fractures, dislocations, soft tissue injuries, and advanced schistosomiasis. There are great differences, even completely opposite, between traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of these diseases. Therefore, conducting some theoretical research on these aspects with emphasis will raise many new questions in medicine, which can not only improve traditional Chinese medicine, but also enrich modern medicine, which is very important.
    Second, summarize the clinical treatment experience and rules of traditional Chinese medicine for certain diseases. The etiology of these diseases has not been completely confirmed by modern science, such as tumors, hypertension, radiation sickness, cirrhosis, chronic nephritis, etc., which are currently difficult to cure, and both traditional Chinese and Western medicine have certain curative effects. For some diseases, the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine is more significant, but it is not stable. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conduct careful clinical observation, case discussion, and scientific analysis of these diseases to find treatment rules, and cooperate with the research on etiology and pathological mechanism to improve their curative effects. In carrying out this work, it is especially necessary to combine the spirit of creativity with the attitude of scientific analysis.
    Third, research on meridian theory and acupuncture. Meridian theory is a comprehensive summary of the phenomena observed by Chinese medical scientists in long-term medical practice of the human body fighting against diseases, that is, from the main treatment effects of acupoints, it is summarized to pathological reactions and physiological phenomena. Meridians are closely related to diagnosis and treatment; meridian theory is one of the theoretical foundations of traditional Chinese medicine. The relationship between acupuncture acupoints and meridians is even closer. To explain the rapid and definite curative effects of acupuncture on many diseases and symptoms, such as arthritis, neuralgia, asthma, appendicitis, shock, pain, paralysis, and radioactive reactions, we can use modern physiology, pathology, especially electrophysiology and pathophysiological methods, combined with meridian theory, to study the physiological and pathological mechanisms of acupuncture acupoints.
    The above three aspects of research have been widely carried out throughout the country, but there is still a lack of experience, and the direction is not clear enough. For example, acupuncture treatment of appendicitis without surgery is being clinically observed almost everywhere, and many cases have been accumulated. Several major hospitals in Shanghai have observed thousands of cases of appendicitis, and there are also many cases in Beijing and other cities, and the curative effect has reached more than 90%. At present, we can organize exchanges of experience in this area and discuss from which aspects to conduct observation and research, so as to make the research direction clearer, the experience richer, and the research work more in-depth. Another example is that the calibration work of the meridian measuring instrument has not been done very accurately, and some problems and differences have been encountered in the experiment, which makes in-depth research and observation difficult. Therefore, for the research on meridian theory, it is more necessary to cooperate in many ways to make the meridian measuring instrument more accurate, and under the premise of close integration of clinical and experimental, conduct multi-faceted observations on various diseases, various disease courses, symptom courses, and physiological states; explore deeply from known phenomena and clarify the relationship between meridians and physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment. Furthermore, in areas such as the treatment of tumors and the reduction of radiation reactions by acupuncture, different levels of experience exist across regions. However, these experiences are largely scattered and should be synthesized and analyzed while also following up with patients to observe their long-term efficacy. Without long-term observation, it is impossible to confirm whether a cure has been achieved. Of course, this does not mean that the therapeutic effects that can alleviate symptoms or temporarily improve the condition can be underestimated. Currently, traditional Chinese medicine has already discovered many cases with special curative effects in clinical observation. These are all valuable clues for scientific research, and we should pay attention to them, summarize experience at any time, hold academic seminars, and promote the spirit of academic democracy to conduct concrete and in-depth discussions and analyses from a theoretical perspective. The content of traditional Chinese medicine is rich and colorful, but it is also very complex. We must recognize the arduousness of exploring the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine in our minds, combine revolutionary vigor with scientific analysis, and conduct serious research and organization in order to obtain better results.
  Regarding the research of traditional Chinese medicine, I believe that it can be carried out in this way:
    First, use modern plant medicine research methods to study herbs that are known to have significant curative effects, conduct chemical analysis and physiological identification, and clarify their physiological and pharmacological effects. Through research in medicinal chemistry and medicinal physiology, it is possible to discover new effective drugs and open up avenues for the invention and creation of new drugs in our country. Dozens of special drugs have been gradually confirmed in clinical practice. They are also a great treasure trove in traditional Chinese medicine, and we should actively conduct research.
    Second, comprehensive research on prescriptions (including folk prescriptions and secret recipes). Prescriptions are the product of the development of drug treatment and the accumulation of experience in exerting the comprehensive effects of drugs by past generations of medical scientists. Therefore, we should take a cautious attitude towards effective prescriptions and not conduct segmented research by pursuing the efficacy of each drug; we should conduct research through careful clinical observation and applying the principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment and prescription composition, combined with modern diagnosis and treatment methods. The observation of cases should have a meticulous plan, and the observation and recording data should be made as suitable as possible for the requirements of scientific research. For example, design special or unified formats for comprehensive analysis, but also avoid unnecessary cumbersome procedures. In frequent case discussions and analyses, summarize the clinical effects of effective prescriptions, distinguish the significance of their monarch, minister, assistant, and guide combinations, and analyze the general rules of their addition and subtraction applications. In recent years, clinical experience in various places has confirmed the regularity of the application of certain prescriptions. If traditional Chinese and Western medicine closely cooperate to further study and summarize the successful and failed experiences in clinical practice, the rules of prescription composition can be found. This requires comprehensive analysis of clinically applied effective prescriptions based on different symptoms, different disease courses, different epidemiological characteristics, and different patient conditions, and searching for their general rules and contingency methods for special circumstances.
    Third, research on the cultivation and introduction of medicinal plants. With the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards and the further implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, the demand for traditional Chinese medicine has greatly increased. Therefore, the State Council has issued instructions requiring provinces and cities to establish medicinal plant bases and combine them with the sideline production of people's communes to organize and plan the planting of medicinal materials, cultivate wild medicinal materials in large quantities, and introduce medicinal materials from other places. This is very correct. However, the cultivation and introduction of medicinal materials, especially the northward migration of southern medicines or the southward migration of northern medicines, will inevitably affect the growth and effective ingredients of medicinal materials due to changes in natural conditions and cultivation methods. Therefore, a series of studies are needed. China has abundant medicinal plants. The identification of the origin, morphology, variety, properties, efficacy, etc. of each medicine, as well as processing and storage, needs to be studied. At the same time, each province also has precious "authentic medicinal materials," which need to be studied in a planned way. First, it is necessary to carefully observe the growth and morphological changes of these precious medicinal materials after introduction or wild domestication, as well as the effective ingredients. Conduct chemical analysis and physiological identification and extraction and analysis of effective ingredients. This is an arduous research task that cooperates with medicinal plant planting bases.
    In terms of organization, I think it can also be carried out from three main aspects:
    First, the collection and organization of folk prescriptions and secret recipes. Since the winter of 1958, provinces and cities have widely carried out folklore collection activities. Millions of folk prescriptions and secret recipes have been collected so far. The work of organizing these large numbers of folk prescriptions and secret recipes has also begun, which is a very huge task that requires good arrangements, planned organization and division of labor, and a clear understanding of the situation. General experience believes that it can be carried out in this way: start with single prescriptions and secret recipes that are more effective, have been circulating among the people for a long time, and have been welcomed by the local people. Take the method of interviews and investigations to initially understand the scope of folk circulation, usage methods and effectiveness, and the reactions of the local people to it; then treat them separately and gradually organize them. When necessary, discussion meetings can be held to analyze the medicinal properties and collect reliable data and arguments; after preliminary editing and organization, eliminate the false and retain the true, and then conduct experimental organization. However, it must be used with caution for patients. Do not obtain single prescriptions and secret recipes and use them casually without investigation. For the sake of prudence, the health departments of provinces and cities can organize committees or groups to organize single prescriptions and secret recipes to lead this work. The original materials that have been collected should be properly stored, as there may be many valuable heritages, and they should never be treated rashly, easily denied, or caused to be lost.
    Second, organize valuable medical records. In the past few years, various places have implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and accumulated many valuable medical records, many of which are clinical data that are worth paying attention to. Scientific analysis of valuable medical records is a meaningful work, from which we can discover rules, learn lessons, and raise questions, so as to provide information for scientific research or further clinical observation. The organization method can be combined with the current learning of traditional Chinese medicine and summarizing clinical experience, and organized by the medical units themselves.
    Third, translate and edit and organize works on traditional Chinese medicine. This is an important topic in organizing the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine. Works on traditional Chinese medicine are truly as vast as the sea. In order to prevent this valuable heritage from being lost and widely used in health care, and to enable more medical workers to fully utilize the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine and use it to enrich the content of world medicine, organization or translation will play an important role. Some traditional Chinese medicine colleges and research units have already carried out some work in this area. Translation and writing must have a correct understanding of traditional Chinese medicine, and it is necessary to avoid far-fetched and over-literal translations, which can lead to misinterpretation and lower the true value and valuable experience of traditional Chinese medicine. It is inappropriate to rigidly apply the vocabulary of modern medicine, but it is also impossible to completely abandon the knowledge of modern natural sciences and social sciences. When necessary, comparison and analogy methods can be used to make it easier for readers to understand without misunderstanding. Regarding syndrome differentiation and treatment and prescription compatibility rules, it is best to integrate organization and translation to make it easier for beginners to get started.
    The People's Daily editorial on January 25, "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine," pointed out that in order to study and organize the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, we cannot rely solely on the strength of Western medicine, nor can we rely solely on the strength of traditional Chinese medicine. Close cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine must be achieved. In research work, a pragmatic spirit must be adopted. Parts that cannot be explained by modern science for the time being should not be easily negated. Parts that are incomplete or immature in experience or theory should not be readily affirmed. A scientific attitude must be taken towards academics, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend must be implemented. Mass academic groups in various places can organize academic report meetings on the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine research in a planned way to liven up the academic atmosphere and exchange experience. This will not only help the research and organization of the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, but also improve: enrich the quality and content of our country's medicine.
    The current task, I believe, is to first analyze, enrich, and promote the application of the many clinical and experimental experiences that have been accumulated nationwide, as well as the cases that have been cured.
    If we can explore experience separately in the above-mentioned major aspects based on the specific conditions in various places and make achievements in 1959, it will be our most meaningful practical action to implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine.

    认真研究整理祖国医药遗产
    钱信忠
    祖国医药学是我国劳动人民几千年来同疾病斗争的结晶。我们现有几千部医学著作和许多散在民间的单方、秘方，都是我国劳动人民和历代医学家对疾病治疗、观察和分析的经验总结，其中蕴藏着许多宝贵的东西，是一个“伟大的宝库”。我们应该很好地学习它，整理它，把它提高到现代科学的水平上，这是我们全体卫生工作人员的责任。
    几年以来，党的中医政策取得了伟大的胜利。特别从1957年整风运动以来，卫生工作人员的政治觉悟普遍地提高了，对党的中医政策有了进一步的认识，基本上扭转了轻视、歧视中医的思想，出现了学习中医、应用中医的热潮，中西医之间的团结合作大大地加强了。祖国医药的宝贵经验得到了普遍的重视，卫生工作人员研究整理祖国医药遗产的情绪日益高涨，并且已经有不少良好的开端。如北京协和医院和北京医学院等单位，不久以前举行了关于使用中医方法治疗阑尾炎的学术会议，找到了一些规律，初步总结了用针灸、中药、手术三种治疗方法的适应症。目前他们正在继续进行研究适应症的早期诊断方法，以便能够掌握各种不同的方法，更有效地治疗病变程度不同的阑尾炎。又如上海第一医学院等单位，在中西医亲密合作下，对全国各种肿瘤治疗有效的方法，进行了系统的分析和研究，吸取了各方剂的长处，制成了一种“消瘤丸”以及各种部位不同的肿瘤的附方，对九十多个病人试用结果，其中对食道癌的疗效最为显著，对肺癌和子宫颈癌的治疗也有相当效果。这种重视祖国医药的新的趋势，几乎遍及全国，因此目前提出认真研究整理祖国医药遗产的工作，是时候了。把散在各地的丰富经验，系统地进行研究分析，整理提高，以寻找它们的规律性，阐明它们的理论和作用机制，充实医学科学内容，使祖国医学更广泛地为人民健康服务，这是我们全体卫生工作人员，尤其是医药科学工作人员的神圣任务。
    根据我国的具体历史条件和科学水平，研究整理祖国医药遗产的方法和要求，我认为可以作如下考虑。
    对中医的研究，从三个主要方面进行：
    第一，研究中医对某些疾病有特殊疗效的治疗方法中的作用和机制问题。这类疾病的病因，已为现代科学所证实，如阑尾炎、结石、聋哑、小儿麻痹、血栓闭塞性脉管炎、骨折、脱臼、软组织损伤和晚期血吸虫病等。对这类病的治疗方法，中西医之间有很大差异，甚至完全相反。因此在这方面有重点地进行一些理论性的研究，会给医学上提出许多新问题，既能提高祖国医学，又能充实现代医学，这是十分重要的。
    第二，总结中医对某些疾病临床治疗的经验和规律。这类疾病的病因，还没有完全为现代科学所证实，如肿瘤、高血压、放射病、肝硬化、慢性肾炎等，目前都是很难根治的疾病，而中西医都有一定的疗效，有的病中医的疗效比较显著，但也不稳定。所以，我们有必要对这类疾病认真地作临床观察，进行病案讨论和科学分析，寻找治疗规律，并配合病因和病理机制的研究，以提高它们的疗效。进行这一工作，特别要把创造性的精神和科学分析的态度结合起来。
    第三，经络学说和针灸的研究。经络学说是我国医学家在长期的医疗实践中观察到的人体同疾病进行斗争的现象的综合，即从俞穴的主治作用，归纳到病理反映和生理现象。经络与诊断和治疗的关系都很密切；经络学说是祖国医学理论基础之一。而针灸俞穴与经络的关系更为密切。要阐明针灸对许多疾病和症状，如关节炎、神经痛、喘息、阑尾炎、休克、疼痛、麻痹、放射性反应等，有迅速而确实的疗效，我们可以应用现代生理、病理学，尤其是电生理和病理生理学等方法，结合经络学说，进行针灸俞穴的生理和病理机制的研究。
    以上三方面的研究工作，目前在全国各地已经普遍地展开，但还缺乏经验，方向也还不够明确。例如针灸治阑尾炎不开刀，几乎各地都在进行临床观察，也积累了不少病例。上海几个大医院对几千个阑尾炎病例进行了观察，北京和其他城市也有很多病例，疗效都达到90％以上。目前就可以在这方面组织交流经验，座谈从哪些方面进行观察和研究，使研究方向更加明确，经验更加丰富，研究工作更加深入。又如经络测定仪的定标工作，还没有很精确地做，实验中遇到一些问题和差异，使深入研究和观察有一定的困难。因此，对经络学说的研究，更有必要多方面协作，使经络测定仪更加精确，在临床与实验密切结合的前提下，对各种疾病，各个病程、症程以及生理状态等，进行多方面的观察；由已知现象，向深处探索，阐明经络与生理、病理、诊断、治疗的关系。再如治疗肿瘤和针灸减轻放射反应等，各地都有不同程度的经验。但是这些经验大体上是分散的，应该进行综合、分析，随访病人，观察它们的远期疗效。如果缺少远期观察，就不能证实根治情况。当然，这不等于说那些能够和缓症状或使病况一时好转的治疗作用可以轻视。目前祖国医学在临床观察中已经发现了很多有特殊疗效的病例，这都是宝贵的科学研究的线索，我们应该加以重视，随时总结经验，召开学术讨论会，发扬学术民主的精神，具体深入地从学理上进行讨论和分析。祖国医学的内容是丰富多彩的，但也是十分复杂的，我们要在思想上认识发掘祖国医学宝库的艰巨性，鼓足革命干劲和科学分析相结合，认真地进行研究和整理，才有可能获得更好的成果。
  对中药的研究，我认为，可以这样进行：
    第一，沿用现代植物药研究的方法，对已知有显著疗效的草味药进行研究，进行化学分析和生理鉴定，阐明它们的生理和药理作用。经过药物化学、药物生理的研究，可能发现新的有效药品，为我国新药的发明创造开辟道路。特效药目前陆续在临床中被证实的已经不下几十种。它们也是祖国医药学中的伟大宝库，我们应该积极地进行研究。
    第二，方剂（包括民间验方和秘方）的综合性研究。方剂是药物治疗发展中的产物，也是历代的医学家发挥药物综合作用的经验积累。因此，我们对于有效的方剂，应该采取谨慎的态度，不要用追求每一味药效的方法，进行分割式的研究；要通过临床的周密的观察，并应用辨症论治和方剂组成的原则，结合现代诊断和治疗方法进行研究。对病例的观察，要有一个周密的计划，把观察记载资料尽量做到适合科学研究的要求。如设计专门的或统一的格式，以便综合分析，当然也要避免不必要的烦琐手续。在经常进行病案讨论和分析中，总结有效方剂的临床作用，区别它们的君、臣、佐、使的配伍意义，分析它们的加减应用的一般规律。几年来，各地的临床经验已经证实了应用某些方剂的规律性。如果中西医密切合作，进一步研究和总结临床中成功的和失败的经验，方剂组成的规律是可以找寻到的。这需要把临床应用的有效方剂，根据不同症状、不同病程、不同流行病学的特点、不同的病人等条件，进行综合分析，寻找它们的一般规律性和特殊情况的应变方法。
    第三，药用植物的栽培、引种的研究。随着人民物质文化生活水平的提高，党的中医政策的进一步贯彻，中药的需求数量大大增长，所以国务院曾经颁发指示，要求各省、市建立药用植物基地，并结合人民公社的副业生产，有组织、有计划地种植药材，大量培植野生药材和引种外地药材。这是十分正确的。但药材的栽培和引种，特别是南药北移或北药南移，由于自然条件、培植方法的变化，必然会使药材生长、有效成分受到影响，所以需要进行一系列的研究。我国有丰富的药用植物，每味药的产地、形态、品种、性味、效用的鉴定，以及炮制、贮藏等，都有研究的必要。同时，各省还有名贵的“道地药材”，要进行有计划的研究，首先要详细地观察这些名贵药材在引种或野生家种后的生长、形态变化以及有效成分，进行化学分析和生理鉴定以及有效成分的提取和分析研究，这是一项配合药物种植基地的繁重的研究任务。
    整理方面，我认为，也可以从三个主要方面进行：
    第一，对验方、秘方的收集和整理。各省、市从1958年冬季以来，广泛地进行了采风运动。目前已经收集到的验方、秘方，数以千百万计。对这大量验方、秘方的整理工作，也已初步开始，这是一件十分庞大的工作，需要很好地安排，有计划地进行组织分工，理出头绪来。一般经验认为可以这样进行：先从较有效用、民间流传较久、已为当地人民所欢迎的单方和秘方着手，采取访问和调查的方法，初步了解民间流传范围、使用方法和成效，以及当地人民对它的反应等；然后分别对待，逐步整理，必要时可以举行座谈会讨论，分析药性，收集可靠的资料和论据；经过初步的编辑和整理，去伪存真，再进行实验性的整理。但用于病人则必须慎重，不能取得单方、秘方后，不加调查，随便使用。各省、市卫生部门为慎重起见，可以组织整理单方、秘方的委员会或小组，领导这一工作。对已经收集起来的原始资料，要妥为收藏，其中可能有很多宝贵的遗产，绝不应该草率从事，轻易否定，造成损失。
    第二，整理有价值的病案。几年来各地贯彻了党的中医政策，积累了不少有价值的病案，其中有很多临床资料是值得重视的。对有价值的病案，进行科学分析，是一件有意义的工作，从中可以发现规律，吸取教训，提出问题，以便为科学研究或进一步临床观察提供资料。整理的方法可以和目前学习中医、总结临床经验结合起来，由各医疗单位自行组织。
    第三，语译和编辑整理祖国医学的著作。这是整理祖国医药遗产中的一个重要课题。祖国医学著作真是浩如烟海。为使这份宝贵遗产不致失传，广泛应用于保健事业，为使更多的医务工作人员能充分利用祖国医学的宝库，并用以充实世界医学内容，整理或语译工作将起重要作用。目前有些中医院校和中医研究单位已经进行了一些这方面的工作。语译和编写，都必须对祖国医学有正确的理解，要避免牵强附会，译意过实，以误传误，贬低了祖国医学真正的价值和宝贵经验。沿用现代医学的语汇死搬硬套，固然不妥，但也不能完全抛弃现代自然科学和社会科学的知识。必要时可以采用对照和比拟说明的办法，使读者容易领会，又不致误解。关于辨症论治、方剂配伍法则，最好能整理和语译兼顾，使初学者更容易入门。
    人民日报1月25日“认真贯彻党的中医政策”社论指出，为了研究整理祖国医药遗产工作，既不能单靠西医的力量，也不能单靠中医的力量，必须通过中西医密切合作。在研究工作中，要采取实事求是的精神，对暂不能用现代科学解释的部分，不宜轻易否定，对经验或理论不完整、不成熟的部分，也不宜急于肯定；要以科学的态度对待学术，要贯彻百家争鸣的方针。各地群众性的学术团体，可以有计划地组织一些祖国医学研究成绩的学术报告会，以活跃学术气氛，交流经验。这既有助于祖国医药遗产的研究整理，又能提高：充实我国医学的质量和内容。
    当前的任务，我认为，首先要把全国已经积累的许多临床和实验的经验以及已经治愈的病例进行分析，加以充实，推广应用。
    1959年如果我们能在上述各主要方面根据各地具体条件，分头探索经验，做出成绩，就是我们贯彻党的中医政策最有意义的实际行动。
