The joint statement signed by the Chinese Communist Party Delegation and the Japanese Communist Party Delegation on March 3rd, following warm and friendly talks, is a historically significant event for our two fraternal parties. It will undoubtedly have a profound impact on further strengthening the fraternal unity of the two parties in their struggle for a common cause and on enhancing friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people.

The Chinese and Japanese party delegations reached complete agreement on the current international situation, particularly the situation in the Far East. The joint statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialist policy of threatening peace in the Far East and infringing on national sovereignty, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia and the world. It exposed the U.S. imperialist collusion with Japanese reactionaries in an attempt to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," revive Japanese militarism, and transform Japan into a U.S. base for aggressive war in the Far East. The two party delegations unanimously stated that they would continue to wage a resolute struggle for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Far East and the Pacific, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, the conclusion of a Far East peace treaty, and a Sino-Japanese non-aggression treaty. Both sides unanimously condemned the deceptive tactics of the Japanese reactionaries on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations and believed that relying on the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people to eliminate various obstacles from the U.S. and Japanese reactionary forces, restoring diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and developing economic, cultural exchanges and friendly exchanges between the two peoples is definitely achievable. The two party delegations unanimously agreed that consolidating and developing the unity of the international communist movement is the sacred internationalist obligation of the two parties; and unanimously agreed that in order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, the struggle against modern revisionism represented by Yugoslavia must be carried through to the end. The propositions put forward in the Sino-Japanese joint statement on resolving the Far East issue and the issue of Sino-Japanese relations are entirely in line with the common interests and common aspirations of the Chinese and Japanese people, and are also entirely in line with the universal peace demands of the people of the Far East and the world. Therefore, the joint statement is a great program for the Chinese and Japanese parties to further unite the Chinese and Japanese people and fight to defend peace in the Far East and the world and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression. It will surely further encourage the common struggle of the two peoples against the U.S. policy of aggression in the Far East, against the revival of Japanese militarism by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

In the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and the revival of Japanese militarism, the Japanese Communist Party has always been the most determined fighter in safeguarding the interests of the Japanese people. Even in the most difficult circumstances, for the sake of the interests of the Japanese people and the nation, and for the sake of peace and security in the Far East and the world, the Japanese Communist Party has always held high the banner of peace, independence, and democracy, and has waged a tenacious and unyielding struggle against all reactionary forces. In recent years, the Japanese Communist Party, together with the Japanese people and all patriotic and democratic forces in Japan, has bravely opposed the U.S. turning Japan into a war base for aggression in the Far East, and opposed the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' revival of Japanese militarism. The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people have also made tremendous efforts to develop friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people and to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. The Chinese people express their heartfelt respect for the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people; and express their deep gratitude for the sympathy and support given by the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people to our people's anti-aggression struggle.

At present, the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people are shouldering arduous and glorious tasks. U.S. imperialism is further colluding with the Japanese reactionaries, plotting to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," revive Japanese militarism, and turn Japan into a U.S. atomic war base for aggression in the Far East, in order to drive the Japanese people to seize chestnuts from the fire for the U.S. aggressive war. According to the plans of the U.S. aggressors, in Western Europe, the West German fascist forces must be revived and West Germany must be turned into a U.S. nuclear war base; in the Far East, the Japanese militarist forces must be revived and Japan must be turned into a U.S. nuclear war base. It is very obvious that in the recent period, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have stepped up preparations to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to achieve this ulterior motive of the U.S. aggressors. Once Japan is turned into a U.S. atomic war base and the Japanese militarist forces are supported, the danger of war in the Far East will inevitably be aggravated. This will not only seriously threaten Japan's independence and security, but will also seriously threaten the peace and security of the Far East and the entire Asian region. Conversely, the success of the Japanese people in opposing the U.S. aggressive war plan is of great significance not only for Japan but also for peace and security in the Far East and Asia. Without Japanese militarism as an accomplice, it would be very difficult for the U.S. aggressors to launch a war in the Far East. The statement issued by the cadre meeting of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on February 14 this year called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese working class to "hold high the banner of peace and neutrality and smash the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," expressing the most urgent demands and aspirations of the Japanese people.

Since the winter of last year, the Japanese people have launched a massive wave of resistance against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and against the revival of Japanese militarism. This struggle is still developing. This is a great struggle unprecedented in Japanese history. It most clearly shows the Japanese people's firm will to oppose war and demand peaceful neutrality, oppose U.S. rule and demand independence and autonomy, and oppose militarism and demand democracy and freedom. The joint statement of the Chinese and Japanese party delegations stated: "The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people have always believed that it is only when Japan gets rid of U.S. control and becomes an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country that it is in the interests of the Japanese people and conducive to peace in the Far East. The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people resolutely advocate the abolition of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan, the abolition of U.S. military bases in Japan, and the return of Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people resolutely support this just and patriotic demand of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people." We firmly believe that the Japanese people will further strengthen their unity and joint action in the struggle, and ultimately overcome the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and realize their aspirations for true independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

### 为中日两国人民的共同事业而奋斗

    为中日两国人民的共同事业而奋斗
    中国共产党代表团和日本共产党代表团经过热烈友好的会谈，3月3日签署了联合声明。这是我们两个兄弟党之间的有重大历史意义的事件。它对于进一步加强两党在为共同事业的斗争中的兄弟般的团结，以及增进中日两国人民之间友好和合作，无疑将产生深远的影响。
  中日两党代表团对目前的国际形势特别是远东形势，取得了完全一致的看法。联合声明强烈地谴责了美帝国主义威胁远东和平和侵犯民族主权的罪恶政策，指出了美帝国主义是亚洲和世界人民的共同敌人，揭露了美帝国主义勾结日本反动派，企图修改日美“安全条约”，复活日本军国主义，把日本变成为美国侵略远东战争基地的阴谋。两党代表团一致表示，要继续为建立远东和太平洋和平地区，建立禁止核武器区，签订远东和平公约和中日互不侵犯条约而进行坚决的斗争。双方一致谴责日本反动派在中日关系问题上的作伪手法，并且相信依靠中日两国人民的共同努力，排除美日反动势力的各种阻碍，恢复中日两国外交关系，发展两国人民的经济文化交流和友好往来，是一定能够实现的。两党代表团一致认为，巩固和发展国际共产主义队伍的团结，是两党的国际主义的神圣义务；并且一致同意，为了保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，必须把反对以南斯拉夫为代表的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。中日两党联合声明中所提出的解决远东问题和中日邦交问题的主张，是完全符合于中日两国人民的共同利益和共同愿望的，也是完全符合于远东和世界各国人民普遍的和平要求的。因此，联合声明是中日两党进一步团结中日两国人民，为保卫远东和世界和平、反对美帝国主义侵略而斗争的伟大的纲领。它必将更加鼓舞两国人民为反对美国对远东的侵略政策、反对美日反动派复活日本军国主义争取恢复中日邦交的共同斗争。
    在反对美帝国主义侵略和日本军国主义复活的斗争中，日本共产党一贯是维护日本人民利益的最坚决的战士。即使在最困难的情况下，日本共产党为了日本人民和民族的利益，为了远东和世界和平和安全的利益，始终高举和平、独立、民主的旗帜，同一切反动势力进行了坚韧的不折不挠的斗争。最近几年来，日本共产党同日本人民和日本一切爱国民主力量一起，英勇地反对美国把日本变成侵略远东的战争基地，反对美日反动派复活日本军国主义。对于发展中日两国人民之间的友好关系，对于恢复中日邦交，日本共产党和日本人民也作了巨大的努力。中国人民对日本共产党和日本人民的爱国的正义的斗争，表示衷心的敬意；对日本共产党和日本人民在我国人民反侵略斗争中所给予的同情和支持，表示深深的感谢。
    目前，日本共产党和日本人民正在肩负着艰巨的同时也是光荣的任务。美帝国主义正在进一步勾结日本反动派，阴谋修改日美“安全条约”，复活日本军国主义，要把日本变成为美国在远东进行侵略的原子战争基地，以便驱使日本人民为美国的侵略战争火中取栗。按照美国侵略者的打算，在西欧，要复活西德法西斯势力，把西德变成美国的核战争基地；在远东，要复活日本军国主义势力，把日本变成美国的核战争基地。很明显，在最近一个时期里，美日反动派加紧准备修改日美“安全条约”，就是为了达到美国侵略者这个不可告人的目的。而日本一旦变成了美国的原子战争基地，日本军国主义势力一旦被扶植起来，那就必然会加剧远东的战争危险。这不仅会更加严重地威胁日本的独立和安全，并且会严重地威胁着远东和整个亚洲地区的和平和安全。反之，日本人民反对美国的侵略战争计划的成功，不但对于日本而且对于远东和亚洲的和平和安全，都具有重大的意义。没有日本军国主义作帮凶，美国侵略者在远东发动战争是十分困难的。日本共产党中央委员会干部会在今年2月14日发表的声明中，号召日共全体党员和日本工人阶级“高举着和平与中立的旗帜，粉碎修改日美安全条约的阴谋”，表达了日本人民最迫切的要求和愿望。
    日本人民从去年冬季以来，为反对美日反动派阴谋修改日美“安全条约”，反对复活日本军国主义，掀起了规模巨大的反抗怒潮。这个斗争还在继续发展着。这是日本有史以来从未有过的伟大斗争。它最清楚不过地表明了日本人民反对战争、要求和平中立，反对美国统治、要求独立自主，反对军国主义、要求民主自由的坚定意志。中日两党代表团的联合声明说：“日本共产党和日本人民向来认为只有当日本摆脱了美国的控制，变成为一个独立、民主、和平、中立的国家，才符合于日本人民的利益，才能有利于远东和平。日本共产党和日本人民坚决主张废除日美‘安全条约’，撤退美国在日本的驻军，撤销美国在日本的军事基地，归还冲绳岛和小笠原群岛。中国共产党和中国人民坚决地支持日本共产党和日本人民的这一正义的和爱国的要求。”我们深信，日本人民在斗争中必将进一步加强团结和联合行动，最终战胜美日反动派的阴谋，实现真正独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望。
