The mother of martyr Liu Hulan, Hu Wenxiu, came to the Fujian front lines with the Shanxi Provincial People's慰问团 to visit the soldiers. The soldiers were overjoyed, beating drums and gongs to welcome her. Zhang Weipan, an artilleryman who bravely protected the cannons during a battle and was awarded a Second Class Merit, nestled beside Liu Hulan's mother, reporting on life and victories on the front lines to the heroic mother, and thanking her and the people of the motherland for their enthusiastic care and support. Mother Liu looked at these young and lovely soldiers and said excitedly: "You are all good soldiers of the people, you are fighting so well!"

Hu Wenxiu walked into the observation post and looked at Jinmen Island, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, through the observation mirror. Then, she went from the position to the kitchen. In the kitchen, she rolled up her sleeves and said: "Comrades, you have worked hard, let me help." The cooks would not let Mother Liu work hard, and Mother Liu anxiously patted cook Lin Zhongyu on the shoulder and said: "Your sister Hulan was the most obedient, but you... ."

"We must be as obedient as sister Hulan!" Lin Zhongyu felt a surge of heat in his heart, and had to gently hand the spatula to Mother Liu.

During the break, Hu Wenxiu was surrounded by the soldiers on the sunny lawn, and affectionately told the soldiers about the beautiful scenery of the people of Shanxi after the establishment of the communes. She also told the soldiers that Yunzhou West Village had established "Hulan Farm." Mother is the leader of the women's company, leading the women to participate in agricultural production, transportation, well-digging, and steelmaking, and other kinds of labor, and making a great leap forward together with the people of the whole country.

The soldiers asked Mother Liu to talk about the life and deeds of sister Hulan. This aroused endless excitement in Mother Liu's heart. When she talked about Hulanzi, who had just turned sixteen, facing the vicious enemy, unyielding to death, and dying heroically, she said passionately: "Hulanzi, she is just like Chairman Mao said: 'She lived greatly, and died gloriously!'"

The soldiers' eyes sparkled with tears, and they clenched their fists.

"Learn from sister Hulan! Avenge sister Hulan!" A solemn oath echoed across the position.

At 1:00 PM on the 7th, the front-line artillery received combat orders. Hu Wenxiu requested the leaders of the troops to allow her to participate in the battle as a militia member. The leaders approved. The soldiers shouted: "Wish Mother Liu every shot hits the target!"

The mighty cannons, with their thick muzzles, coldly pointed at Jinmen Island.

"First round, load!" Following the squad leader's command, Hu Wenxiu held a large artillery shell in both hands and deftly loaded it into the chamber. Then she reported: "Ready!" Then she pulled the firing cord, stood proudly, and waited for the squad leader's firing order.

The young squad leader Pei Yingsong held the telephone in one hand and clenched his fist tightly in the other, and commanded in a solemn and loud voice: "Respected Mother Liu! In order to defend the motherland, in order to liberate Taiwan, and in order to avenge sister Hulan, fire!"

Like a fearless warrior, Hu Wenxiu pulled the firing cord with all her strength, and suddenly flames burst from the muzzle, the shell whizzed through the sky, flew across the strait, and went straight to Jinmen Island.

"Boom!" The shell fired from the hands of the heroic mother exploded on the enemy's position. The observation post immediately called to report: "Well done! Hit the target!" The soldiers burst into applause and cheers: "Mother Liu did a great job! Mother Liu did a great job!"

Mother Liu smiled.

    刘胡兰烈士的母亲在前线
    新华社记者　姜庆肇
    英雄刘胡兰烈士的母亲胡文秀随山西省人民慰问团来到福建前线，看望战士们来了。战士们喜气洋洋，敲锣打鼓地欢迎她。曾经在一次战斗中英勇掩护大炮安全荣立二等功的炮手张伟盼，依偎在刘胡兰妈妈的身边，向英雄的母亲汇报前线的生活和胜利，并且感谢妈妈和祖国人民的热情关怀和支援。刘妈妈打量着这些年轻可爱的战士，激动地说：“你们都是人民的好战士，你们打得太好啦！”
    胡文秀走进观察所，从观察镜里看了看蒋军盘踞的金门岛。接着，又从阵地走进厨房。在厨房里，她挽起袖子说：“同志们辛苦了，让我来帮帮手吧。”炊事员们哪里肯让妈妈劳累，刘妈妈急得直拍着炊事员林忠玉的肩膀说：“你们的胡兰姐最听话啦，可是你们……。”
    “我们也要像胡兰姐一样听话！”林忠玉心里一阵火热，只得轻轻地把炒菜的铲子交给了刘妈妈。
    休息的时候，胡文秀被战士们围坐在春光明媚的草坪上，亲热地向战士们讲述着山西人民实现公社化后的美好光景。她还告诉战士们，云周西村已经建立了“胡兰农场”。妈妈是妇女连的连长，领着妇女们参加农业生产、运输、打井和炼钢炼铁等各种劳动，同全国人民一起大跃进。
    战士们再请妈妈讲一讲胡兰姐的生平和事迹。这激起了刘妈妈心情的无限激动。当她讲到刚满十六岁的胡兰子在凶恶的敌人面前，临死不屈，英勇就义的时候，激昂地说：“胡兰子，她正像毛主席说的：生的伟大，死的光荣！”
    战士们一个个闪烁着晶莹的泪花，捏紧了拳头。
    “向胡兰姐学习！为胡兰姐报仇！”阵地上滚动着一片庄严的宣誓声。
    7日下午一时，前线炮兵接到了战斗命令。胡文秀请求部队首长允许她以民兵身份参加战斗。首长批准了。战士们高呼：“祝刘妈妈百发百中！”
    威武的大炮，粗大的炮口冷冷地指向金门岛。
    “一发装填！”紧随着班长的口令声，胡文秀双手端起一颗大炮弹，动作敏捷地填进了炮膛。然后报告了一声：“好！”接着便扯着拉火绳，昂然站立着，静候班长的射击命令。
    年轻的班长裴应松一手握着电话机，一手紧捏着拳头，以庄严宏亮的声音命令道：“敬爱的刘妈妈！为了保卫祖国，为了解放台湾，为了给胡兰姐报仇，开炮！”
    像无畏的战士一样，胡文秀用全力把拉火绳一拉，顿时炮口迸出火焰，炮弹呼啸着划破长空，飞过海峡，直捣金门岛。
    “轰！”发自英雄母亲手中的炮弹在敌军阵地上爆炸了。观察所马上来电话报告：“打得好！击中目标！”战士们一阵掌声夹着一阵欢呼：“刘妈妈打得好！刘妈妈打得好！”
    妈妈笑了。
