The Maldives, located 640 kilometers southwest of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean, is a nation comprised of over six hundred small islands. The total area is over 296 square kilometers, with Malé Island, the largest, being the location of the capital. The population is 93,000, mostly Maldivians, with the remainder being Arabs, Malays, and Dravidians from India, predominantly followers of Islam. The inhabitants of the Maldives are mostly engaged in fishing and overseas trade.

The Maldives has a history of over 800 years of Islamic dynasties. When the colonialists expanded eastward, the Maldives, like other Eastern countries, suffered invasion and enslavement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maldives was successively occupied by Portugal and the Netherlands. In the late 19th century, it became a dependency of Britain. In 1952, the Maldives declared itself a republic; in February 1954, the Maldivian National Assembly announced the abolition of the republic and reverted to a sultanate.

On January 1, 1953, Britain and the Maldives signed a treaty stipulating that the Maldives was a member of the British Commonwealth, that Britain continued to control its foreign affairs and defense, and had the right to use its islands as bases. Since Britain was forced to agree to withdraw from its military base in Ceylon, it has been even more eager to occupy and expand its base in the Maldives archipelago for the long term. In early 1957, Britain signed a treaty with the then pro-British Prime Minister stipulating that Britain could establish military bases in the Maldives. However, due to popular opposition, this treaty was not approved by the National Assembly, and the pro-British government was overthrown as a result. In December 1957, Ibrahim Nasir became the Prime Minister of the Sultanate of the Maldives, and remains so to this day. Prime Minister Nasir's policy of peace and neutrality reflects the wishes of the Maldivian people. From February 1958, the Maldivian government began negotiations with the British government, demanding that Britain recognize the Maldives as an independent and autonomous nation, and stated that negotiations on the issue of British military bases could only take place on this premise. However, British representatives adhered to the colonialists' position, and the negotiations failed to make any progress. (Attached picture)

    印度洋上的岛国—马尔代夫
    马尔代夫位于锡兰西南六百四十公里的印度洋上，是由六百多个小岛组成的国家。总面积为二百九十六余平方公里，其中最大的马尔岛，是首都所在地。人口九万三千人，大部分是马尔代夫人，其余为阿拉伯人、马来亚人和印度的达罗维荼人，以信奉伊斯兰教为主。马尔代夫居民多从事渔业和海外贸易。
    马尔代夫有八百多年的伊斯兰王朝的历史。当殖民主义者向东方扩张的时候，马尔代夫和其他东方国家一样遭到了入侵和奴役。十六和十七世纪，马尔代夫曾先后被葡萄牙和荷兰侵占；十九世纪末叶，又沦为英国的附属国。1952年马尔代夫宣布为共和国；1954年2月，马尔代夫国民议会宣布废除共和制，改为苏丹国。
    1953年1月1日，英国和马尔代夫签订条约，规定马尔代夫是英联邦成员国，英国继续控制它的外交和国防，并有权使用它的海岛作为基地。自从英国被迫同意从在锡兰的军事基地撤出后，就更加想长期占领和扩充在马尔代夫群岛的基地。1957年初，英国即与当时的亲英首相签订了一项条约，规定英国可以在马尔代夫建立军事基地。但是在人民的反对下，这项条约未得国民议会批准，亲英政府也因此下了台。1957年12月，易卜拉欣·纳西尔出任马尔代夫苏丹国首相，直至今日。纳西尔首相执行的和平中立政策反映了马尔代夫人民的愿望。从1958年2月起，马尔代夫政府即开始同英国政府谈判，要求英国承认马尔代夫为独立自主国家，并且表示只有在这一前提下，才能进行英军基地问题的谈判。但是，英国代表坚持殖民主义者的立场，谈判始终未能获得任何进展。（附图片）
