    Everyone Uses Their Brains to Create New Tools
    Yunnan Water Conservancy Construction Site Launches High-Efficiency Competition
    
    (Our Dispatch) Yunnan's water conservancy construction sites have launched a competition craze centered on striving for high efficiency. More than one million people of all ethnic groups are in high spirits and full of ideas. Currently, more than 200 million cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, exceeding the amount of work done in the same period last year, but the labor force used in water conservancy is only equivalent to one-third of last year's.
    
    Although Yunnan increased its irrigated area by 8.34 million mu last year, exceeding the total construction volume in the thousands of years before liberation, it has not fundamentally overcome the threat of drought followed by flooding. Continuing the great battle for water conservancy is still the urgent demand of farmers of all ethnic groups, but to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, it is impossible to have as much labor force on water conservancy construction sites as last year. Therefore, the migrant workers at various water conservancy construction sites launched a revolutionary friendship competition to strive for higher efficiency, better quality, and earlier completion. The first to launch a challenge throughout the province was the Dongfeng Reservoir in Yuxi County. This is a large reservoir project with a storage capacity of 120 million cubic meters, originally planned to require more than 10,000 migrant workers, but only 5,000 people were deployed. Due to practical work, hard work, and clever work, they completed the estimated amount of work according to schedule. After they issued a challenge to the whole province, they immediately received enthusiastic responses from more than 600 large and medium-sized reservoir construction sites in thirteen special zones, autonomous prefectures, and cities throughout the province. Driven by the competition wave, all the migrant workers in this reservoir further boosted their efforts, launched a five-day and five-night assault, and built six roads including those for cattle carts, mine cars, and mine car tracks. They added more than 100 cattle carts and horse carts, more than 90 mine cars, and also installed a large flying car and five small flying buckets, so that the average daily compaction of earthwork per person reached four cubic meters, doubling the increase before the challenge.
    
    At the same time, competitions were also launched between counties, between construction sites, and between types of work within the construction sites. The Zhaotong Special Zone successively organized three high tides of high-efficiency competitions. People of all ethnic groups, with the revolutionary enthusiasm to strive for a greater leap forward and the heroic spirit of not fearing any hardship, fought on the icy and snowy ground and on the cliffs. In this special zone, more than 1,600 migrant workers from the Baiyang Reservoir in Yiliang County worked on high mountains with an altitude of more than 2,000 meters. In order to achieve high efficiency, all water conservancy construction sites in the region extracted 19% to 20% of the labor force to set up more than 2,300 factories, and manufactured and improved nearly 90,000 tools. At present, the average efficiency of 125 large, medium, and relatively small reservoir construction sites has reached more than six cubic meters. The average efficiency of the whole region has reached 3.99 cubic meters, of which the average efficiency of Qiaojia, Weixin, and Yanjin counties has broken through six cubic meters. After Tengchong County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, proposed that everyone should use their brains and liberate their minds, and launched a high-efficiency campaign of one person抵顶 equaling one hundred people to challenge the whole prefecture, Changning County immediately launched a campaign of one person equaling two hundred to five hundred people to learn from Tengchong and surpass Tengchong. The water conservancy construction site in Longling County fully implemented wooden track soil transportation and automatic soil unloading in the competition, and the daily amount of soil increased from 1,200 cubic meters to 3,900 cubic meters. In the red flag competition of the Fuge River Reservoir in Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, the tool reform was carried out vigorously. Now, transportation has been realized by cars, soil extraction has been done by piling, soil transportation has been done by chutes, soil loading and unloading have been automated, and tamping has been done by animal-powered stone rollers, eliminating phenomena such as human back carrying, human shoulder carrying, and human head carrying. The average efficiency has reached five cubic meters.
    
    In the competition, many high-efficiency experiences and methods created by various places were quickly promoted and continuously developed. The Baimiao Reservoir in Baoshan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, created the experience of taking more than 30,000 cubic meters of stone at a time. After learning from it, the migrant workers of Sancha River in Shiping County developed it and created the experience of deep-hole blasting, and the amount of stone taken greatly exceeded that of Baimiao Reservoir in Baoshan County. After learning from it, the migrant workers of Longtan Reservoir in Jianshui County further created a blasting method combining large, medium, and small cannons, and the amount of stone taken exceeded that of Sancha River in Shiping County. In order to timely promote advanced tools and create tools suitable for construction sites, many regions have generally promoted the experience of running factories on construction sites. Some water conservancy construction sites have also established steel mills. General tools are made of crude steel produced by themselves, and ball bearings and pulleys are installed on many tools, which greatly improves efficiency.
    
    In the competition, all localities attached great importance to the quality of the project and the safety of the construction site, and listed ensuring quality and safe production as one of the important contents of the competition. Many construction sites have also organized inspection and acceptance teams to effectively ensure the quality of the project. (Chen Weigeng)

    人人动脑筋　创造新工具
    云南水利工地展开高工效竞赛
    本报讯　云南各水利工地掀起了以争取高工效为中心的竞赛热潮。百余万各族民工斗志昂扬，智慧百出。目前已完成两亿多土石方工程量，超过了去年同期的工程量，但是，用在水利方面的劳动力只相当于去年的三分之一。
    云南虽然在去年增加灌溉面积八百三十四万亩，超过解放前几千年建设总量的一倍，仍还没有从根本上摆脱先旱后涝的威胁。继续大战水利仍是各族农民的迫切要求，但是今年要更大更好更全面的跃进，上水利工地的劳动力不可能有去年那么多。因此，各水利工地的民工发起了力争工效更高，质量更好，完工更早的革命友谊竞赛。首先在全省范围内提出挑战的是玉溪县东风水库，这是一个蓄水一亿二千万方的大型水库工程，原计划需要一万多民工，而他们只上阵了五千人，由于实干、苦干、巧干，按进度完成了预计的工程量。他们向全省提出挑战后，立即得到了全省十三个专区、自治州、市六百多个大、中型水库工地的热烈响应。在竞赛浪潮的推动下，这个水库全体民工进一步鼓足更大的干劲，突击五昼夜，修通了包括牛、马车、矿车轨道等六条道路，增加了一百多辆牛、马车，九十多辆矿车，还装起一架大飞车，五架小飞兜，使平均每人每日压实土方达到四方，比挑战前提高了一倍。
    与此同时，县与县、工地与工地以及工地内部工种与工种之间也展开了竞赛。昭通专区连续组织了三次高工效竞赛高潮，各族人民以争取更大跃进的革命热情，和不怕任何艰苦的英雄气概，战斗在冰天雪地和悬岩绝壁上。该专区彝良县白杨水库一千六百多民工在海拔二千多公尺的高山上工作，为了达到高工效，全区各水利工地抽出了19％到20％的劳动力办起两千三百多个工厂，制造和改良了近九万件工具。目前，已有一百二十五个大、中及较大小型水库工地平均工效达到六方以上。全区平均工效已达三点九九方，其中巧家、威信、盐津等县平均工效都已突破六方。德宏傣族景颇族自治州腾冲县提出人人动脑筋，个个思想大解放，开展一人抵一百人的高工效运动向全州挑战后，昌宁县立即开展一人抵二百人到五百人的运动来学腾冲，超腾冲。龙陵县的水利工地在竞赛中全部实行木轨道运土，自动卸土，每天就由上土一千二百方增加到三千九百方。澜沧拉祜族自治县富格河水库在红旗竞赛中，大闹工具改革，现已实现运输车子化，取土排桩化，运土溜槽化，上土卸土自动化，夯压畜力石碾化，消灭了人背、人挑、人顶等现象，平均工效达五方。
    在竞赛中，各地创造的许多高工效的经验和办法，很快就得到了推广，并不断地有了新的发展。德宏傣族景颇族自治州保山县白庙水库创造了一次取石三万多方的经验，石屏县三岔河民工学了后，加以发展，创造了深眼大爆破的经验，取石量大大超过了保山县白庙水库。建水县龙潭水库民工学了后，又进一步创造出大、中、小炮相结合的爆破法，取石量又超过了石屏县三岔河。许多地区为了及时推广先进工具和创造适合工地用的工具，普遍推广了工地大办工厂的经验，若干水利工地还建立了炼钢厂，一般的工具都用自己炼出的粗钢来制造，并在很多工具上安上了滚珠和滑轮，大大提高了工效。
    各地在竞赛中，都十分重视工程质量和工地安全，把保证质量和安全生产列为竞赛的重要内容之一。许多工地还组织了检查验收小组，切实保证工程质量。（陈渭庚）
