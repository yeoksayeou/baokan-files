Turning Beaches into Parks

The Dengta Management Area of the Nan San Island Commune in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, has been continuously greening the beaches for years, transforming the originally barren sandy coast into a tree-lined seaside park. Forestry workers from various provinces attending the national afforestation and landscaping conference praised this place as a red flag for the national coastline of over 10,000 kilometers to move towards landscaping.

The Dengta area, facing the sea on its southeast sides, now has greenery everywhere along its coastline. The dense forest belt has also brought water sources and patches of green grass to this area, nourishing poultry, livestock, and crops. But a few years ago, except for a small amount of arable land, it was all a vast expanse of sandy wasteland. These shifting sands often submerged farmland and damaged crops. According to surveys, more than 1,000 mu of farmland were swallowed by shifting sands in the twenty years from 1929 to 1949. Due to frequent wind, sand, and drought disasters, grain production often suffered consecutive years of crop failure.

After the cooperativization in 1955, this area began to mobilize the masses to green the beaches and build coastal protection forests. After several years of efforts, a protection forest belt, 22 li long and about half a li wide, has been built on the coastal beaches, and 16,000 mu of forest have been planted on the inland sandy wasteland. The afforestation area accounts for 64% of the total area of the island, with a total of more than 6.4 million Casuarina trees planted. The trees planted in 1955 are now about 10 meters high with a diameter at breast height of 7 centimeters, and those planted in the spring of 1958 are generally as high as 3 meters. Now the forest belt has completely fixed the coastal shifting sands, the sandy wasteland between the forest belts has also turned into grassland, and the groundwater level has also increased. Under the protection of the forest belt, the damage from typhoons has also been greatly reduced.

After this area built the protection forest belt, it played a significant role in promoting agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Last year, more than 2,400 mu of rice and miscellaneous grain crops avoided wind, sand, and drought disasters, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average increase of 530 jin of rice per mu. Two hundred and five mu of farmland that had been submerged by shifting sands have been restored to cultivation. Several hundred mu of grassland near the forest belt have been used to build three livestock farms and nineteen poultry farms, raising more than 6,250 pigs, cattle, sheep, etc., and more than 11,900 chickens, geese, and rabbits. The dead branches and fallen leaves of the trees have completely solved the problem of firewood for the residents, greatly saving labor.

### 变海滩成公园

    变海滩成公园
    广东省湛江市郊南三岛公社灯塔管理区连年不断绿化沙滩，已将原来满目荒沙的海岸变为林木参天的海滨公园。参加全国造林、园林化会议的各省林业工作者，都盛赞这个地方为全国一万多公里海岸线迈向园林化的一面红旗。
    东南两面临海的灯塔区，现在整个海岸线上已绿荫处处。茂密林带还给这个地区带来了水源和片片绿草，滋养着禽畜和庄稼。但在几年前，这里除少量耕地外全是一片茫茫的沙荒。这些流沙经常淹没农田和损害庄稼。据调查，从1929至1949年二十年间，被流沙吞没的农田就有一千多亩，由于风、沙、旱灾频繁，粮食生产常常连年失收。
    1955年合作化后，这个地区开始发动群众绿化沙滩，营造海岸防护林。经过几年来的努力，已在海滨沙滩上营造起一条长达二十二华里、宽约半华里的防护林带，又在内陆沙荒上造林一万六千亩，造林面积占全岛总面积的64％，共种下木麻黄六百四十多万株。1955年种的树现已高约十公尺，胸径七公分，1958年春种的一般也高达三公尺。现在林带已将海岸流沙全部固定下来，林带间的沙荒也变成了草地，地下水位也有提高。在林带保护下，台风的灾害也大大减轻。
    这个地区营造防护林带以后，对促进农、林、牧、副、渔生产发挥了重大作用。去年二千四百多亩水稻和杂粮作物避免了风、沙、旱灾，获得空前丰收，平均每亩增产稻谷五百三十斤。过去被流沙淹没的农田已有二百零五亩恢复耕种。林带附近的几百亩草地已建起了三个畜牧场和十九个养禽场，饲养猪、牛、羊等六千二百五十多头和鸡、鹅、兔一万一千九百多只。林木的枯枝、落叶已彻底解决了居民的柴薪问题，大量节省了劳动力。
