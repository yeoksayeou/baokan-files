    Against US Corporations Interfering in Public Life
    Residents of Argentine Capital Hold Demonstration
    Buenos Aires dispatch: To protest against the rise in electricity prices, residents of the Argentine capital, disregarding police obstruction, held demonstrations and rallies in heavy rain on the 24th, demanding that the government abolish the contract signed between the power company and American enterprises. This increase in electricity prices was proposed by the American company that recently invested in the power company.
    The "Central Coordinating Committee of the Movement Against Increasing Electricity Prices," which led the rally, issued a statement at a press conference held on the 23rd. The statement pointed out that raising electricity prices by 300 percent "leaves people living in darkness and forces small businesses to close down." In a petition to the government, the committee demanded the abolition of the contract signed between the power company and the American company, and demanded that "international electrical trusts no longer interfere in Argentina's public life."
    Since the power company decided to increase electricity prices at the request of the American company, the Argentine people have immediately launched a widespread protest movement. They put forward the resounding slogan "Don't pay electricity bills!" Masses in the capital and other cities hold protest rallies almost every day.

    反对美国企业干涉公共生活
    阿根廷首都居民举行示威游行
    布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：为反对电费涨价，阿根廷首都居民不顾警察的阻挠在24日冒大雨举行了游行和集会，他们要求政府废除电力公司和美国企业签订的合同。这次电费涨价，是最近在电力公司进行投资的美国公司提出的。
    领导这次集会的“反对增加电费运动中央协作委员会”曾在23日举行的记者招待会上发表声明。声明指出，把电费提高百分之三百“使人民生活在黑暗之中，并且使得小工商业被迫停业”。委员会在给政府的请愿书中要求废除电力公司和美国公司签订的合同，并且要求“使国际电业托辣斯不再干预阿根廷的公共生活”。
    自电力公司应美国公司的要求决定提高电费以后，阿根廷人民立即掀起了一个广泛的抗议运动。他们提出了“不要付电费！”的响亮口号。首都和其他城市的群众差不多每天都举行抗议集会。
