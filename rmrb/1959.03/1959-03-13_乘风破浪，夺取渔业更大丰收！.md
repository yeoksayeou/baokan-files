Riding the Wind and Waves to Seize a Greater Fishing Harvest!	Zhang Shuyuan

The fisheries of Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province (now merged with Yangchun into Liangyang County), increased by 4.77 times last year compared to 1957. Last year's bumper harvest in fisheries was the result of implementing the Party's General Line, putting politics in command, liberating thought, opposing right-leaning conservatism, and launching a large-scale mass movement. We have the following points of understanding regarding the fisheries production movement over the past year:

      Break Conservatism, Strive for the Top
In fisheries production, those who harbor conservative ideas particularly emphasize the power of the ocean while ignoring the infinite wisdom of the working people. The ideas of "waiting for the sky to provide food" and "relying on the wind to catch fish" are extremely serious. When we proposed that fisheries production should also have a Great Leap Forward, they said, "Whether or not production can be increased depends on what the sea says." Especially during February to April (the past considered off-season), they believed that there was no possibility of increasing production at all.

In response to these erroneous ideas, the county party committee summarized the typical experience of Dongping Port transforming the off-season into a peak season, held on-site meetings, and organized an on-site debate on winning the "Great Spring Sea" and transforming the off-season into a peak season through comparison and visits. Last year, Dongping Town, due to its focus on going out to sea diligently, casting more nets, seizing time, seizing the wind, transforming single operations into multiple operations, and transforming shallow sea production into long-distance port production, took the lead in the four-month "Great Spring Sea" battle and long-distance production movement. Dongping Port, which had always been in the middle reaches, jumped to the top reaches, increasing production by 54% compared to the same period of the previous year. The output of Haiying Cooperative in one season exceeded the total output of 1957. These vivid facts severely criticized the conservative complacency of the cadres and their mentality of being content with being in the middle reaches, freeing them from their ideological constraints. As a result, a thunderous and surging "Small Spring Sea" production upsurge was launched throughout the county.

    Change Single Operations to Multiple Operations
The second problem hindering the Great Leap Forward in fisheries production is that ocean-going trawlers are limited to their original production scale and production habits, only engaging in trawling operations and not engaging in other operations. When the main operations are facing off-season, while other multiple operations are still promising, they let go of the good opportunity and sigh at the ocean! This makes large-boat trawling production far behind small boats during the large and small spring sea periods. After the "May Water", the "multi-single dispute" became the focus of the debate between promoters and conservatives. Some members of Zhapo and Shaba ports, who were accustomed to "trawling operations," said: "Trawling is our housekeeping skill. If we do many kinds of sea (multiple operations), the number of net casts is high, and the output is low. It is both hard work and troublesome. This is the way to 'master many skills, become poor', not the way to increase production." However, Dongping Port greatly increased production by combining encirclement, angling, and stabbing, and implementing mother-child system (large boats carrying small boats) to adapt to multiple operations. In order to vigorously promote the mother-child system and multiple operations, the county party committee spent twenty-five hours renovating fifty-two canvas boats in the second brigade of Zhapo Port and equipped them on sixteen large trawlers. When the large boats anchored at sea, the sixteen mother-child boats equipped with small boats showed their power, each small boat increasing income by four loads of fish per day, making the "master many skills, become poor" faction dumbfounded. After the on-site meeting, multiple operations became a high tide. All large and small fishing boats in the county completely eliminated single operations. Therefore, production in June and July flourished. Zhapo increased production by 198% compared to the same period of the previous year, and Shaba increased production by two times. The entire county increased production by one time compared to the same period of the previous year.

    Both Raise and Catch, Grasp Production and Manufacturing Together
The third problem hindering the Great Leap Forward in fisheries production is "emphasizing catching and neglecting raising" and neglecting processing work. Because we implemented the policy of raising and catching simultaneously, and grasping production and processing together, we made fish fry the leader in the aquaculture industry. All ports and semi-fishing and semi-farming areas mobilized the masses to participate in the fish fry collection movement, and combined it with water conservancy construction to build large-scale standard sea dikes. In order to cultivate a large number of mussels, etc., the masses in various places took out old bamboo rafts, old bamboo baskets, and bamboo poles for drying clothes as attachment devices for collecting seedlings. In addition to fully utilizing mountain ponds and reservoirs, we also built eight sluice gates on six rivers to raise fish.

After more than three months of hard work by the masses, the aquaculture area increased greatly. By the end of October last year, the county's marine aquaculture area had expanded twenty-five times compared to 1957. Freshwater aquaculture also expanded from more than 13,700 mu last year to more than 80,000 mu.

In order to implement the policy of grasping production and processing together, we vigorously built comprehensive aquatic product processing factories. Zhapo and Dongping used local methods to use shellfish, algae, and fish as raw materials to make more than 40 new products, including special grade dried shrimp, fish board glue, fish meal, artificial fish lips, puffed fish glue, dried foreign fish, dried shark, and shark strips, which are also sold to foreign markets such as Malaysia. We also used shrimp, crab, turtle, and other shells to make chitin, used fish scraps and fish bones to make fish meal, and used second-class fish and shrimp to make fish sauce and shrimp sauce. After some aquatic products are processed into new products, their economic value is greatly increased, and their uses are more extensive.

    Break the "Small Circle", Open Up New Fishing Grounds
Whenever the autumn flood arrives, the large boats in Yangjiang fishing grounds have the habit of long-distance production at other ports, but small and medium-sized boats never travel long distances. The situation of the Great Leap Forward in fisheries in 1958 encouraged the masses, and some people proposed the demand for small and medium-sized boats to produce at other ports. The leadership supported this bold proposal and organized large-scale production of small and medium-sized boats at other ports. However, this "breaking the routine" approach was opposed by conservatives. After fully mobilizing the masses and unifying their thinking, 90% of the fishing boats in the county participated in production at other ports, from Shanwei in the east to Qingcong in the west, Gan Chang, Changhua, Beibu Gulf and other places. In order to strengthen the leadership of production at other ports, we set up a command post according to the season to select key harvesting points and organized a large-scale maritime transport team, which sailed out with materials and medical personnel to ensure the supply of fishing boats at other ports and the health of the members. Due to breaking the routine and expanding the fishing grounds, 1958 achieved a greater harvest than 1957.

In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in fisheries production, it is necessary to vigorously promote the tool reform movement. By the end of November last year, there were 48 major innovations in various fishing gears and operating methods in the county. Because this innovation generally increased production by 30% to one time, or even two or three times. At the same time, in order to strongly support the Great Leap Forward in fisheries production, we have expanded six shipyards, three cable-making factories, and three ironware factories in the past year, equipped with tools such as electric saws, electric drills, and electric piles, which greatly improved production efficiency.

Riding the Wind and Waves, Continue to Advance

In Yangjiang County, more than 40,000 professional fishermen and coastal semi-fishing and semi-farming areas have implemented communization in 1958. Coupled with the experience and material foundation of the bumper harvest in 1958, fisheries production in the future will surely show a greater and more comprehensive leap forward. In terms of fishing operations, we must vigorously increase the construction of motorized sailing and motorized wheel ships, implement single-boat operation methods, develop mother-child system, multiple operations and crop rotation, and develop the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands through long-distance voyages. In terms of marine aquaculture, we must vigorously develop the production of fish fry, algae, and shellfish, as well as fisheries processing production. In terms of freshwater aquaculture, we must vigorously develop basic construction, vigorously develop artificial incubation of fish fry, and vigorously cultivate carp, mullet, and African crucian carp, so that every pond has fish and the output per mu is 10,000 jin.

In order to ensure a greater leap forward in 1959, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, further overcome conservative ideas, vigorously carry out mass movements, and effectively grasp the key measures for increasing fisheries production, especially do a good job in the rectification and consolidation of people's communes. We have the confidence and determination to complete this year's aquatic product production increase plan. (Attached picture)

Frame net fishing is a kind of large fishing tool in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province, which can encircle hundreds of acres of lake fish at a time. In mid-January this year, members of the Wanzihu Commune in Yuanjiang County created a record of 25,000 jin of fish caught in one net. This is a picture of the members collecting the net.

### 乘风破浪，夺取渔业更大丰收！

    乘风破浪，夺取渔业更大丰收！	张书元
    广东省阳江县（现已与阳春合为两阳县）的渔业，去年比1957年增产四点七七倍。去年的渔业生产大丰收，是贯彻党的总路线，政治挂帅，解放思想，大反右倾保守，大搞群众运动的结果。我们对于一年来的渔业生产运动，有如下几点体会：
      破保守，争上游
    在渔业生产中，抱有保守思想的人，特别强调海洋的威力而无视劳动人民的无穷智慧。“等天吃饭”、“靠风流捕鱼”的思想极为严重。我们提出渔业生产也要大跃进，他们就说：“能不能增产要问大海才知道”。特别在2月至4月（过去认为的淡季）里，他们更认为根本没有增产的可能。
    针对这些错误思想，县委总结了东平港变淡季为旺季的典型经验，召开现场会议，通过评比、参观，组织了从战胜“大春海”，变淡季为旺季的现场大辩论。东平镇去年由于抓紧了勤出海，多下网，抢时间，抢风流，化单一作业为多种作业，化浅海生产为远航过港生产等办法，在四个月的“大春海”战斗和过港生产运动中，过去一贯居于中游的东平港跃居了上游，比前一年同期增产54％。海英社一季的产量超过1957年总产量。这些活生生的事实狠狠地批判了干部的保守自满、甘居中游的思想，解除了他们的思想束缚。这样一来，一场雷霆万钧、波涛汹涌的“小春海”生产高潮便在全县范围内开展起来了。
    改单一作业为多种作业
    阻碍渔业生产大跃进的第二个问题，是远洋拖风船局限于原有的生产规模和生产习惯，只搞拖风作业，不搞其他经营。当主要作业面临淡季，而其他多种作业尚大有可为时，却放过良机，望洋兴叹！这就使大船拖风生产在大小春海期中，远远落在小船的后头。在“五月水”以后，“多单之争”成为促进派与保守派争论的焦点，习惯于
  “拖风作业”的闸坡、沙扒两港一些社员说：“拖风是看家本领，做什海（多种作业）网次多，产量低，既辛苦、又麻烦，这是“百艺百穷”，非增产之道。但东平港采取围、钓、刺相结合，并实行母子化
  （大船带小船）与多种作业相适应的办法，却大大增了产。为了大力推广母子化与多种作业，县委在闸坡港第二联队用二十五个小时突击装修好五十二艘帆布艇，配在十六艘大拖风船上。当大船在海上抛锚时，配有小艇的十六艘母子船便大显神威，每小艇每天增收四担鱼，使“百艺百穷”派瞠目结舌。召开现场会议后，多种作业就变成了高潮。全县大小渔船完全消灭了单一作业，因此，6至7月份的生产便蒸蒸日上。闸坡比前年同期增产198％，沙扒增产二倍。全县则比前年同期增产了一倍。
    又养又捕，产制齐抓
    阻碍渔业生产大跃进的第三个问题，是“重捕轻养”，忽视加工工作。我们由于贯彻养捕并举，生产加工一齐抓的方针，使鱼瑥在养殖业中挂帅，各港和半渔农地区动员了广大群众，投入采集鱼苗运动，并结合修水利，修筑大型标准海塘。为了要大量养殖贻贝等，各地群众把旧竹笏缆、旧竹箩、晒衫竹竿拿出来，当采苗附着器。我们除了山塘水库全部利用外，还把六条河涌建起了八道水闸拦起来养鱼。
    经过广大群众三个多月的奋战，养殖面积大增，至去年10月底，全县海水养殖面积，比1957年扩大二十五倍。淡水养殖也由去年的一万三千七百多亩扩大到八万多亩。
    为了贯彻生产加工一齐抓的方针，我们大搞水产品综合加工厂，闸坡、东平靠土办法利用贝藻鱼类为原料，制成新产品四十多种，其中特级虾米、鱼板胶、鱼粉、人造鱼唇、泡沙鱼胶、洋鱼干、鲨鱼干、鲨鱼条等，还远销马来亚等国外市场。我们还利用虾、蟹、鳖等甲壳制成甲壳素，利用鱼碎、鱼骨制成鱼粉，利用次鱼、次虾制成鱼露和虾露。有些水产品经过加工制成新产品之后，经济价值大大提高，用途更为广泛。
    破“小圈圈”，辟新渔场
    每逢秋汛到来时，阳江渔场的大船都有远航过港生产的习惯，可是中小船从来不远航过港。1958年渔业大跃进的形势，鼓舞了群众，有人提出了中小船过港生产的要求。领导支持了这个大胆的建议，组织了中小船大规模过港生产。可是这种“打破常规”的作法又遭到保守派的反对。经过充分发动群众，统一思想，全县90％的渔船都参加了过港生产，东至汕尾，西至清从，感昌、昌化、北部湾等地。为了加强过港生产的领导，随着季节选择抢收重点设立指挥部，并组织大规模的海上运输队，连物资带医务人员一齐出航，保证过港渔船的供应和社员身体健康。由于大破常规，扩大了渔场，使1958年获得了比1957年更大的丰收。
    为适应渔业生产大跃进形势要求，必须大搞工具改革运动。到去年11月底止，全县革新各种网具及操作方法主要的有四十八项。由于这种革新一般增产30％至一倍，甚至二、三倍以上。同时，为了有力的支援渔业生产大跃进，一年来，我们扩建了六个造船厂、三个打缆厂、三个铁器厂，设备了电锯、电钻、电桩等工具，大大提高了生产效率。
    乘风破浪，不断前进
    阳江县四万多专业渔民和沿海半渔农地区，1958年已实行了公社化，加上1958年大丰收的经验和物质基础，今后的渔业生产必将出现更大、更全面的跃进。在捕捞作业方面，要大力增造机帆机轮船，实行单船操作法，开展母子化、多种作业兼轮作，远航开发西沙群岛南沙群岛。海水养殖方面要大搞鱼瑥、藻类、贝类生产及渔业加工生产。淡水养殖方面，大搞基本建设，大力发展人工孵化鱼苗，大力培育鲤鱼、鲻鱼、非洲鲫，做到塘塘有鱼，亩产万斤。
    为了保证1959年更大的跃进，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，进一步克服保守思想，大搞群众运动，切实地抓好渔业增产的关键措施，尤其做好人民公社的整顿巩固工作。我们有信心有决心完成今年水产增产的规划。（附图片）
