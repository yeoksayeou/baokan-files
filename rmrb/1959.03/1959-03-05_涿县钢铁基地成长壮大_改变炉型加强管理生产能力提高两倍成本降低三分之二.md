The Zhuoxian steel industry in Hebei Province, after rectification, consolidation, and improvement, has replaced all the original scattered small indigenous furnace production with small modern furnaces. The production capacity has increased more than twofold, the cost has been reduced by two-thirds, and a new enterprise management system has been established.

Starting in August of last year, the whole party and all the people in Zhuoxian County vigorously developed the steel industry. In less than a month, more than 4,500 indigenous iron-smelting furnaces were built throughout the county. By the end of the year, a total of more than 16,000 tons of pig iron were produced, winning the glorious title of "Steel Champion" of Baoding Prefecture.

In order to further develop steel production, from mid-December of last year, the Zhuoxian County Party Committee began the work of rectifying, consolidating, and improving the small indigenous furnace clusters, abolishing all thirteen small indigenous furnace clusters in Qinggang, Songlindian, and other places far from the mines and inconvenient for transportation. Steel joint factories were built on the basis of the three small indigenous furnace clusters in Zhuozhou Town, Laishui Town, and Gaobeidian. In just over a month, these three steel joint factories built sixty-two small blast furnaces with volumes of 6.5 to 28 cubic meters, increasing the production capacity from an average of 96 tons of pig iron per day in the past to 300 tons.

While adjusting the leadership structure and assigning personnel and leadership, these three steel joint factories also mobilized the workers of each factory to establish simple and easy-to-implement quota management, planning management, and safety technology responsibility systems. From cadres to the masses of workers, the concept of cost accounting was further established. After the factories mobilized workers to implement "four determinations" (determination of personnel, output, quality, and consumption) based on each furnace, the furnace workers automatically formulated the "eight no acceptances" handover system, such as not accepting furnace loss materials, not accepting ore that has not been calcined, and not accepting insufficient gas supply, as well as systems for blast furnace production logs, after-shift production analysis, and material requisition. The number of production workers in small 6.5-cubic-meter blast furnaces throughout the county has generally decreased from more than 100 people (two shifts) to 45 people (three shifts), and the average daily output has increased from 2 tons to 4.6 tons, with the consumption of coke per ton of iron reduced from 4 tons in the past to less than 2 tons. At the same time, the factory mines also reduced the number of functional departments from six to three: production technology, finance, and supply and marketing, and increased the laboratory. Administrative management personnel were reduced to 3% of the total number of workers, a reduction of two-thirds.

In order to improve labor efficiency and reduce costs, the county also launched a technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization of the production process, mobilizing workers from steel joint factories, iron mines, refractory materials, and coking plants. The workers of each factory and mine adopted the method of using local materials and attacking foreign methods with indigenous methods, manufacturing a set of mechanical equipment from mining, transportation, coal washing, coking to blast furnace charging and water supply to equip themselves, which greatly improved labor efficiency.

The quality of iron produced by the various steel joint factories in the county is still unstable, and the sulfur content fluctuates. The cost of iron is still relatively high. At present, the county is mobilizing the masses of workers and taking various measures to solve these problems. (Fang Chen)

    涿县钢铁基地成长壮大
    改变炉型加强管理生产能力提高两倍成本降低三分之二
    本报讯　河北省涿县钢铁工业经过整顿、巩固和提高，原来分散的小土炉生产全部由小洋炉代替，生产能力提高两倍多，成本降低三分之二，一套新的企业管理制度已经建立起来。
    去年8月开始，涿县全党全民大办钢铁工业，不到一个月时间，全县就建起土炼铁炉四千五百多座，到年底共生产生铁一万六千多吨，获得了保定专区“钢铁冠军”的光荣称号。
    为了进一步发展钢铁生产，从去年12月中旬，中共涿县县委对小土炉群开始了整顿巩固和提高工作，将离矿山远、交通不便的青岗，松林店等十三处钢铁小土炉群全部撤销，在涿州镇、涞水镇、高碑店三处小土炉群的基础上建设钢铁联合厂。一个多月时间，这三座钢铁联合厂建起了六十二座容积六点五到二十八立方公尺的小高炉，生产能力由过去平均日产生铁九十六吨提高到三百吨。
    这三座钢铁联合厂在调整领导机构进行定员、定领导的同时，还发动各厂职工建立起简单易行的定额管理、计划管理和安全技术专责制，从干部到工人群众进一步树立起成本核算观念。各厂发动工人以炉为单位进行了定员、定产、定质和定消耗的四定以后，炉前工人自动制订出了炉亏料不接，矿石不焙烧不接、煤气不够不接等“八不接”交接班制度和高炉生产日志、后班生产分析、领取材料等制度，全县六点五立方公尺的小高炉生产工人由原来的一百多人（两班生产）普遍减少到四十五人（三班生产），平均日产量由两吨提高到四点六吨，由过去的四吨焦炭炼一吨铁降低到两吨以下。同时各厂矿也由六个职能科室减少到生产技术、财务、供销三个职能科，增加了化验室，行政管理人员缩减到占工人总数的3％，减少了三分之二。
    为了提高劳动效率，降低成本，这个县还发动钢铁联合厂、铁矿、耐火材料和炼焦厂职工，开展起以生产过程机械化为中心的技术革命运动。各厂矿职工采取就地取材，以土攻洋的办法，制造出从采矿、运输、洗煤、炼焦到高炉上料、上水等一套机械设备装备了自己，大大提高了劳动效率。
    这个县各个钢铁联合厂的铁的质量还不稳定，含硫量忽高忽低；铁的成本仍然较高。目前，这个县正在发动职工群众和采取各种措施解决这些问题。　（方辰）（附图片）
