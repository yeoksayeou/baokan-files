    African Women Are Heroically Struggling
    Lu Ying
    The African women's movement is closely linked to the African people's struggle for national liberation. In recent years, African women have played an increasingly important role in the burgeoning anti-colonialist struggle of the African people.
    Under long-term colonial rule, African women are in a state of extreme poverty and backwardness. Moreover, due to the constraints of religion and feudal customs on women, women in many African countries still wear veils, polygamy is still very common, and few are educated. For example, 90% of school-age children in Black Africa cannot attend school, with girls accounting for the largest proportion. Due to extremely poor medical and maternal and child health conditions, infant and maternal mortality rates are very high. For example, child mortality rates in Togo and the Congo are as high as 45%-50%.
    African women deeply understand that to achieve their own liberation, they must first destroy the colonial system, because it is the root of poverty, enslavement, and humiliation.
          Fighting Algerian Women
    Algerian women, along with their husbands, fathers, and brothers, participated in the sacred national liberation war.
    In the army and auxiliary service teams, there are female soldiers, as well as female attendants who undertake various tasks. Especially in cities still occupied by French colonialists, the task of liaison officers is mainly undertaken by women. In order to cross police blockades every hundred meters, they risk their lives every minute, but they have successfully completed their tasks. There are many female doctors or nurses in the medical teams, who try their best to take care of the wounded and enable them to recover as soon as possible and return to the front lines. In rural areas, women often complete a major task with selfless spirit: when the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army rest after battles or after marching seventy to one hundred kilometers overnight, they are responsible for guarding, washing clothes, and preparing meals for the Liberation Army soldiers, so that they can set off again at nightfall. They are also often responsible for transporting weapons.
    Fighting Algerian women are contributing their strength to the sacred cause of national liberation.
    The Old Mother of Cameroon
    In the Cameroonian people's struggle against the French bloody rule, women also stood at the forefront, and they also made contributions in the fierce armed struggle. We have heard a story from an African friend about an old mother who scouted enemy positions for the guerrillas. This old mother disguised herself as a peanut vendor, and regardless of her life, she sold peanuts near a police station with a large number of guns every day, learned the positions of the doors and windows and the nearby roads, and told the guerrillas. According to the report, the guerrillas made deployments and successfully completed the attack plan, killing four enemy soldiers, capturing six alive, and seizing more than one hundred automatic rifles to equip themselves. This is just one chapter in the epic of the Cameroonian women's struggle.
    South African Women Resisting Racial Discrimination
    African women in the Union of South Africa suffer double oppression. First, as Africans, they are subjected to the oppression of racial discrimination; second, as female workers and peasant women, they are subjected to the oppression of capitalists and landlords. However, South African women do not resort to moaning and sighing, but actively participate in the struggle like women in other countries.
    South African women have demonstrated incredible and astonishing strength in the struggle against the government's forced implementation of the so-called identity card system for black women last year and this year. From October 21st to 22nd last year, countless black women held demonstrations in front of the South African government's Department of Native Affairs for two consecutive days to protest this barbaric identity card system. The South African authorities brutally suppressed these unarmed women, arresting more than two thousand women in just three weeks from October to November last year. However, the prisons and clubs of the South African authorities cannot scare the brave South African women. On February 26th this year, more than two thousand African women in the African residential town of Lady Selborne in the Union of South Africa held a rally to protest the government's issuance of identity cards.
    In the African people's struggle against colonial rule and for national independence, African women have written many inspiring poems. With the rise of the African national independence movement and the growing strength of the world's peace forces, African women will achieve even more brilliant victories. (Attached picture)

    非洲妇女在英勇斗争着
    鲁映
    非洲的妇女运动是同非洲人民的民族解放斗争密切结合在一起的。近几年来，在蓬勃发展的非洲人民反殖民主义斗争中，非洲妇女所起的作用越来越大了。
    非洲妇女在长期的殖民统治下，处于极端贫穷和落后的状态；更由于宗教和封建习俗对妇女的束缚，至今非洲许多国家的妇女还带着面纱，一夫多妻制还很普遍，受教育的还很少，如黑非洲90％的学龄儿童不能入学，其中女孩子占的比例最大；由于医疗和妇婴卫生条件非常差，婴儿和产妇的死亡率很高，如多哥和刚果等国儿童死亡率即高达45％—50％。
    非洲的妇女深深懂得，要求得自身的解放，首先要摧毁殖民制度，因为它是贫困、奴役和屈辱生活的根源。
          战斗着的阿尔及利亚妇女
    阿尔及利亚的妇女同她们的丈夫、父亲和兄弟一道参加了神圣的民族解放战争。
    在军队和辅助服务队里，有女战士，也有担负各种任务的女服务员。特别是在仍为法国殖民者占领的城市里，联络员的任务主要由妇女担任，因为要越过每一百公尺一道的警察封锁线，她们每分钟都冒着生命的危险，但是她们出色地完成了任务。在医疗队里有很多女医生或护士，她们想尽办法来照顾伤员，使他们早日恢复健康，重上前线。在农村里，妇女经常以忘我的精神来完成一项重大的任务：当解放军的指战员们在战斗后或经过一夜七十到一百公里的行军休息时，她们就负责放哨，她们替解放军战士洗衣服，准备伙食，使他们一到天黑就再出发。担负武器运输工作的也经常是她们。
    战斗着的阿尔及利亚妇女正在为民族解放的神圣事业贡献着自己的力量。
    喀麦隆的老妈妈
    喀麦隆人民在反抗法国血腥统治的斗争中，妇女也站在最前线，在激烈的武装斗争中同样也有她们的贡献。我们曾听到过非洲朋友谈的一位老妈妈为游击队侦察敌情的故事。这位老妈妈乔装成一个卖花生的小贩，不顾生命危险，每天带着花生到藏有大量枪支的警察派出所附近叫卖，把门窗的位置和附近的道路都了解得一清二楚，告诉了游击队。游击队根据报告进行部署，胜利完成了袭击计划，杀死了四个敌兵，活捉了六个，缴获了一百多支自动步枪装备了自己。这只是喀麦隆妇女斗争史诗中的一个篇章。
    反抗种族歧视的南非妇女
    南非联邦的非洲籍妇女受着双重压迫。首先，作为非洲人，遭受着种族歧视的压迫；其次，作为女工和农妇要受资本家和地主的压迫。但是，南非妇女并不是求助于呻吟和叹息，而是和其它国家的妇女一样积极地参加斗争。
    南非妇女在去年和今年反对政府强迫对黑人妇女实施所谓身份证制度的斗争中，更显示出无比的惊人力量。去年10月21日到22日，无数黑人妇女接连两天在南非政府土著事务部前举行示威，反对这种野蛮的身份证制度。南非当局对这些手无寸铁的妇女进行了残酷的镇压，在去年10月到11月仅仅三周内即逮捕了二千多妇女。但是，南非当局的监狱和大棒吓不住勇敢的南非妇女。今年2月26日，在南非联邦非洲人聚居的雷迪塞耳博尼镇又有二千多名非洲籍妇女举行集会，抗议政府颁发身份证。
    在非洲人民反抗殖民统治和争取民族独立的斗争中，非洲妇女已经写下了不少可歌可泣的诗篇。随着非洲民族独立运动的高涨和世界和平力量的日益壮大，非洲妇女将会取得更为辉煌的胜利。（附图片）
