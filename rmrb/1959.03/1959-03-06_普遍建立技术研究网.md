Establish Technical Research Networks Universally
Sun Zhen

Yangzhong County has established a wheat technical research network. Generally, every 10 to 15 mu of land has a trained commune member as a technician, who regularly communicate with each other and exchange experiences. This provides a reliable technical guarantee for striving for high wheat yields. This is an excellent organizational form for implementing the mass line in technical promotion work, and a concrete application of the working method of combining points and surfaces, and combining the specific and the general, in technical work.

The technology for striving for high wheat yields is very complex. This year and in previous years, this place and that place, have commonalities and differences. Establishing a technical research network and training a large number of technical backbones can allow us to flexibly and creatively adopt technical measures on different wheat fields based on past experience and this year's new circumstances. In different regions, due to different climates and soil qualities, some need watering and some need drainage. At different times, because the wheat seedlings are growing differently, the amount of fertilizer required is different, and the composition of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers is also different. Yangzhong County has a technician for every 10 to 15 mu of land. Each technician is very familiar with the piece of land they manage. This allows them to make clever arrangements according to the time and place, take measures based on the seedlings and the weather, and closely integrate general experience with specific circumstances.

Establishing a technical research network can also quickly and timely apply the advanced experience of high-yield plots to general fields, promoting overall high yields. Technicians from each production team can visit high-yield plots to learn, or participate in the production activities of high-yield plots while learning experience. High-yield fields take the lead, and general fields catch up wave after wave, constantly improving technical levels.

With a technical research network, it is also easier to exchange experiences with each other in a timely manner. The experience of high-yield plots is certainly worth learning from, but general fields may also have aspects that can be learned from in certain areas. These scattered experiences can be gathered through the technical research network to become more systematic experience. "A wise man may make a mistake in a thousand considerations." Managers of high-yield plots can also draw on more experience through the technical research network to make their experience more perfect.

Technical research networks can also serve as an intelligence network for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests is one of the important checkpoints for high wheat yields. On the one hand, it is necessary to prepare sufficient pesticides and equipment and train prevention and control personnel as early as possible. On the other hand, it is necessary to attach great importance to doing a good job in intelligence work. Many diseases and insect pests spread rapidly. If they are not prevented and controlled in time, the diseases and insects will have already become harmful, and even if there are pesticides and equipment, it will not be easy to quickly extinguish them. Technical research networks are scattered in every corner of every commune. Once diseases and insect pests are discovered, they can be immediately reported to various places to organize forces to extinguish or prevent them in a timely manner.

This organizational form of researching and promoting technology is worth greatly promoting. It should not only be established in wheat field management, but also universally established in various crop fields, preferably starting at the beginning of spring sowing.

    普遍建立技术研究网
    孙振
    扬中县建立了三麦技术研究网，一般每十亩到十五亩都有一名经过训练的公社社员担任技术员，他们经常互相联系，交流经验。这就使争取三麦高产在技术方面有了可靠的保证。这是在技术推广工作中贯彻执行群众路线的一个很好的组织形式，是点和面相结合、特殊和一般相结合的工作方法在技术工作中的具体运用。
    争取三麦高产的技术是很复杂的，今年和往年，此地和彼地，有共同之处，也有不同之处。建立技术研究网，训练大批技术骨干，就可以根据过去的经验和今年的新情况，在不同的麦田上灵活地创造性地采取技术措施。在不同的地区，因为气候、土质不同，有的需要浇水，有的需要排水。在不同的时间，因为麦苗生长情况不一样，所需肥料的数量就不一样，氮、磷、钾肥的成分也不一样。扬中县每十亩到十五亩地设一个技术员；每个技术员对自己管理的一片土地非常熟悉，这就可以因时因地巧安排，看苗看天加措施，把一般的经验和特殊的情况密切地结合起来。
    建立技术研究网，还可以把高额丰产田的先进经验，迅速及时地在一般田运用起来，促进全面丰产。各个生产队的技术员，可以到高额丰产田参观学习，也可以一边参加高额丰产田的生产活动，一边学习经验。丰产田先行一步，一般田一浪赶一浪，不断提高技术水平。
    有了技术研究网，也便于及时地互相交流经验。高额丰产田的经验固然值得大家学习，一般田也可能在某一方面有可供学习之处；这些零星的经验通过技术研究网集中起来，就能成为比较系统的经验。“智者千虑，必有一失。”高额丰产田的管理者，也可以通过技术研究网，吸取更多的经验，使自己的经验更加完美。
    技术研究网，还可以起防治病虫害的情报网的作用。防治病虫害，是三麦丰产的重要关口之一。一方面要准备充足的农药和器械，及早训练防治人员，一方面要十分重视做好情报工作。许多病虫害蔓延很快，如不及时防治，病虫已经成害，虽有药械也不易迅速扑灭。技术研究网散布在每个公社的每个角落，一旦发现病虫害，就可以立即通报各地，及时组织力量扑灭或预防。
    这种研究和推广技术的组织形式，值得大大提倡。不但要在小麦田间管理中建立，也可以在各种作物田间普遍建立，最好在春播开始时就建立起来。
