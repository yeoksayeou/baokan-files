    Flower Tune Spreads Fragrance
    Ma Ke
    On the "Hundred Flowers Garden" of the February 16th People's Daily, eighth edition, Comrade Li Ji's "Hoping for Another Flower to Bloom" was published. The poet enthusiastically praised the "Flower" singers on the Yin Taolai construction site for creating the first "Flower Tune" drama, while criticizing the erroneous views of "art for art's sake" advocates on "Flower," and hoping that professional artists would write scripts, organize tunes, and support this nascent genre.
    "Flower" is a kind of mountain song popular in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai in the Northwest, and its form is similar to the "Xintianyou" of northern Shaanxi. Singers call girls "flowers" in their songs, hence the name of this kind of mountain song. This is a very apt name, because each of these melodious and unrestrained songs is like a wild flower blooming on a hillside in spring, exuding a fresh fragrance.
    Is it possible to use this kind of mountain song as the basis for the singing style of a new genre?
    This question has not only been answered by today's facts, but also by historical evidence. For example, the music composition of the Southern Song Dynasty Yongjia Zaju, which predates Yuanqu, was "made from village tunes, with no palace tones and rarely any rhythm, simply taking what was easy for farmers and market women to sing" ("Preface to Southern Lyrics"). It can be seen that mountain songs and ditties have always been an important foundation for opera music, and in the trailing melodies of some more developed opera genres today, such as Gaoqiang, the distinct traces of mountain songs can still be seen.
    In recent decades, some local opera genres that have developed and formed, such as Ping Opera, Xi Opera, and Yue Opera, have absorbed rich musical elements from mountain songs and ditties. In recent years, some mountainous areas in the south and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities have also successfully developed several local opera genres based mainly on mountain songs. It seems that from mountain songs to opera, this is not a question of possibility, but an objective law in the development of our national musical culture.
    The tunes of "Flower" are generally slow-paced. As the basic singing style of a genre, can it be competent?
    In fact, the answer to this already exists in the development of the "Flower" tunes themselves. With the changes of various lyrics, "Flower," in addition to having slow-paced tunes with sufficient lyrical nature, also has various tunes that express passion, narration, or mutual response. In terms of rhythm, in addition to the lyrical free rhythm, there are also general four-beat, two-beat, and three-beat and five-beat, which are rare in general folk songs but quite accurate. These changes have already given "Flower" a good foundation as an opera singing style, and it will be further developed in opera with the expression of content.
    Generally, operas developed from folk songs and ditties often have two musical situations: one is that there are many "qupai" (tune patterns) in the folk songs, and after being absorbed into the opera, they still use the changes and contrasts of various different qupai as the main method of expression, such as Flower Drum Opera; the other is that there are not many "qupai" in the folk songs, but there are rich variations on a few basic tunes, and after being absorbed into the opera, this technique of rhythmic variation on the basic tunes is more fully developed, such as Bangzi Opera. The situation of "Flower Tune" is obviously closer to the latter. But these two types of situations and two methods are not absolute, not opposed, but often complement each other and penetrate each other, so this does not mean that "Flower Tune" cannot absorb other tunes in its development.
    The development of "Flower Tune," according to the current situation of opera and opera development in our country, seems to have two paths. One is to focus on mass creation, with folk "Flower" singers as the main force, and follow the path of traditional opera in terms of creation, performance, and singing. Professional artists should also actively participate in this work, learn from the masses, and improve the creative level of the masses. The other is also based on the music of "Flower," but can be more professionally processed, and can have greater flexibility in absorbing other musical elements, and the expression method does not have to be limited to the tradition of opera. This is the general "new opera." Of course, the creation of new opera should not be limited to this style and approach, but this kind of new opera with a stronger earthy flavor will surely be warmly welcomed by the masses.
    Writing here, I can't help but close my eyes and imagine: after some time, what a glorious and brilliant genre "Flower Tune" will form! It will prove to us how beautiful and fragrant flowers can bloom in the soil of the folk, and how people cultivate and appreciate these flowers with such wise labor and such broad vision!

    花曲吐芬芳
    马可
    2月16日人民日报第八版的
  “百花坛”上，登载了李季同志的“希望再开一朵花”。诗人满怀热情地赞扬了引洮工地上的“花儿”歌手们创造了第一个“花曲”的剧目，同时批判了“艺术至上”论者对“花儿”的错误看法，并希望专业的文艺工作者编写剧本、整理曲调，扶持这一新生的剧种。
    “花儿”是流行在西北甘、宁、青一带的一种山歌，其形式与陕北的“信天游”差不多。歌手们在歌唱中称姑娘们为“花儿”，这种山歌也因此而得名。这倒是一个非常贴切的名称，因为这些悠扬、奔放的歌曲，每一首都像春天山坡上盛开的野花，吐露清新的芳香。
    用这种山歌作为一个新的剧种唱腔的基础是否可能呢？
    这个问题不仅已有今天的事实作了回答，而且也有历史的证明。例如，远在元曲之前的南宋永嘉杂剧，它的音乐构成，就是“即村坊小曲而为之，本无宫调，亦罕节奏，徒取其畸农市女顺口可歌而已”（“南词叙录”）。可见，山歌、小曲自来是戏曲音乐的一个重要基础，在今天一些比较发达的大剧种如高腔的拖腔中，还可以看到山歌的鲜明痕迹。
    近几十年来发展、形成的一些地方剧种如评戏、锡剧、越剧等，都曾从山歌、小曲中吸收了丰富的音乐成分。最近几年来，南方一些山区和兄弟民族地区，也以山歌为主要基础发展成功了几个地方剧种。看来，从山歌到戏曲，这不是可能与否的问题，而是我们民族音乐文化发展中的一种客观规律。
    “花儿”的曲调一般是节奏漫长的，这作为一个剧种的基本唱腔，能不能够胜任呢？
    其实，这在“花儿”曲调本身的发展中已经有了答案。随着各种不同歌词的变化，“花儿”除了具有充分抒情性质的漫长曲调以外，也有表现激情的、叙述的或互相应答的各种曲调。在节拍上，除了抒情性的自由节奏外，还有一般的四拍子、二拍子和在一般民歌中罕见但却颇为准确的三拍子和五拍子。这些变化，已经使得“花儿”作为一种戏曲的唱腔有了良好的基础，它在戏曲中随着内容的表现还将得到更进一步的发展。
    一般从民歌小曲发展而成的戏曲，在音乐上往往有这样两种情况：一种是民歌的“曲牌”很多，被吸收进戏曲后仍以各种不同曲牌的变化、对比为主要的表现方法，如花鼓戏等；一种是民歌的“曲牌”不多，但在少数基本曲调上有丰富的变体，被吸收进戏曲后更充分发展了这种基本曲调上的节奏变化手法，如梆子戏等。“花曲”的情况显然更接近后一类。但这两类情况和两种方法不是绝对的，不是对立的，而常常是相辅相成、互相渗透的，所以这并不意味着“花曲”在发展中不能吸收其他的曲调。
      “花曲”的发展，按照我国目前戏曲和歌剧发展的情况来看，似乎可以有两种途径。一种是以群众性的创造为主，以民间的“花儿”歌手为主，在创作、表演、歌唱等方面走传统戏曲的路子，专业的艺术家也应积极主动地参加这一工作，向群众学习，同时提高群众的创作水平。另一种是同样在“花儿”的音乐基础上，但可以作更大的专业性加工，在吸收其他音乐成分上可以有较大的灵活性，表现方法上不一定局限于戏曲的传统。这即是一般所说的“新歌剧”吧。当然，新歌剧的创作决不应限于这一种风格和做法，但这样带有更强烈的泥土香味的新歌剧也必将是群众所热烈欢迎的。
    写到这里，不禁闭目畅想：若干时日以后，“花曲”将形成一种怎样光辉灿烂的剧种！它将向我们证明，民间的土壤上能够开出多么鲜美的香花，人民又是以多么智慧的劳动和多么博大的眼光来栽培和欣赏这些花朵！
