Rehabilitating Cao Cao

Cao Cao, though he fought the Yellow Turbans, did not betray the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising

Cao Cao fought the Yellow Turban peasant uprising at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty; this is a historical fact. It can be said that this is the most inglorious page in Cao Cao's life.

The question today is: should Cao Cao, who fought the peasant uprising, be cursed for thousands of generations?

Cao Cao was not the only one who fought the Yellow Turbans at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty; Liu Bei, Sun Jian, Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, and others also fought them.

To put the historical scope more broadly: Emperor Guangwu of Han, Liu Xiu, fought the Red Eyebrows and Bronze Horses; Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin, fought Dou Jiande and Liu Wuzhou; Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang, and the Hegemon-King of Chu, Xiang Yu, were both leaders of uprisings but fought each other; Emperor Taizu of Ming, Zhu Yuanzhang, did not directly seize the throne from the Yuan Dynasty but mainly from those who rose in rebellion before and after him.

Therefore, the question should be further examined: what were the consequences of Cao Cao's fight against the Yellow Turban rebels?

In my opinion, although Cao Cao fought the Yellow Turbans, he did not betray the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising. What was the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising? It was that the people wanted food, land, and to survive. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the people's sources of food and clothing were monopolized by the corrupt dynasty and some imperial relatives, eunuchs, and powerful families; they killed each other, causing the people to suffer cruel labor, be separated from the land, and be unable to make a living, even to the point described in Cao Cao's poem, "For a thousand miles, no cock crows; of living people, one in a hundred remains" (see "Song of Hao Li"). The people wanted to survive, so they had to revolt.

But how could the purpose of the uprising be achieved? It should have had a relatively good military organization. If it was just a rabble, the future could be foreseen: it would either gradually disappear or gradually deteriorate.

What was the organizational situation of the Yellow Turban rebels at that time? It was really bad. There were many people, tens of thousands or more than a million at once, but "the groups followed each other, the army had no baggage, and only plunder was used for supplies" ("Wei Zhi·Wu Di Ji," Bao Xin's words). This means that men, women, old, and young were all together, without military rations, just eating along the way. Such military action was difficult to sustain.

This situation was not limited to the Yellow Turban rebels. There was a general food shortage in northern China at that time. Even the so-called government troops of the prefectures and states were also a rabble. The lost "Wei Shu" has the following description:

"Since the chaos of the famine, they were generally lacking food. The armies rose together, without a year-long plan. When hungry, they plundered; when full, they abandoned the surplus. The number of those who disintegrated and dispersed, defeated themselves without an enemy, was countless. When Yuan Shao was in Hebei, the soldiers relied on eating mulberries; when Yuan Shu was in Jianghuai, they subsisted on snails. People ate each other, and the towns and villages were desolate." ("Wei Zhi·Wu Di Ji," note quoting the first year of Jian'an) The so-called government troops, a rabble, "disintegrated and dispersed, defeated themselves without an enemy," so how could the Yellow Turban rebels be exempt? The main reason for the failure of Zhang Jiao's brothers, the leaders of the Five Pecks of Rice sect, lies here. Yuan Shao's soldiers ate mulberries when they had mulberries, and Yuan Shu's soldiers ate snails when they had snails. What happened when these things were eaten up or unavailable? Then they had to eat people. Therefore, Liu Bei's subordinates had eaten human flesh, and Cao Cao's subordinates did the same; this is recorded in the history books.

Inseparable from military action is the need for food; this is common sense. Therefore, "sufficient food and sufficient troops" are linked together. If there are troops but no food, in addition to natural disintegration, the phenomenon of "whoever has milk is my mother" can also occur. Some of the Yellow Turban rebels depended on Yuan Shu or Sun Jian, and some even protected the emperor. Please see the following two historical records:

In the first month of the first year of Jian'an, in Runan, "the Yellow Turbans He Yi, Liu Pi, Huang Shao, He Man, and others each had tens of thousands of followers, initially responding to Yuan Shu and then attaching themselves to Sun Jian." ("Wei Zhi·Wu Di Ji") In the eleventh month of the second year of Xingping, Emperor Xian of Han moved east. On the way, "Yang Feng and Dong Cheng led the Bai Bo leader Hu Cai, Li Le, Han Xian, and the Xiongnu Right Worthy King Qubei (originally mistakenly written as 'Left Worthy King,' now corrected) to lead troops to welcome him, fought with Li Jue and others, and defeated them." (Bai Bo refers to the Yellow Turban rebels who rose in the Bai Bo Valley.) ("Hou Han Shu·Xian Di Ji") Isn't this a change in quality? The peasant uprising army actually colluded with powerful clans, even with the emperor!

However, although Cao Cao fought the Yellow Turbans, he did organize them. In the winter of the third year of Chuping (193 AD), he defeated the Yellow Turbans east of Shou Zhang, pursued them to Jibei, and the Yellow Turbans begged to surrender. Then, he "accepted the surrender of more than 300,000 soldiers and more than 1 million men and women, and selected the elite among them to be called the Qingzhou soldiers." ("Wei Zhi·Wu Di Ji") This was the foundation of Cao Cao's military power. Just like Emperor Guangwu of Han broke the Bronze Horses and was supported by the Bronze Horse rebels as the "Bronze Horse Emperor," Cao Cao was supported and became the leader of the Qingzhou soldiers. We can think: if Cao Cao was completely a person who was bloodthirsty and acted recklessly, how could hundreds of thousands of Qingzhou soldiers and more than a million peasant men and women listen to his command? Wouldn't they have turned around and killed him, or simply dispersed in a chaotic rush? But it wasn't like that. So it is worth re-examining the so-called historical verdict.

It is undeniable that Cao Cao had military genius and organizational skills. The Yellow Turban rebels were indeed spared the suffering of "disintegration and dispersal" through his organization. The historical fact is like this, and it is not good to obliterate it.

Cao Cao had the Qingzhou soldiers, but there was still a major problem that had not been solved at the same time, that is, the problem of military rations. This problem was postponed for three years, and in the first year of Jian'an (196 AD), it was finally solved. That is, he adopted the suggestions of Zao Zhi and Han Hao to establish the Tuntian system (military agricultural colonies). The text above, from the "Wei Shu," under "People ate each other, and the towns and villages were desolate," reads:

"The Duke said, 'The art of stabilizing the country lies in strengthening the army and having sufficient food. The Qin people conquered the world by emphasizing agriculture, and Emperor Wu stabilized the Western Regions with the Tuntian system. These are the good examples of previous generations.' In that year (the first year of Jian'an), he recruited people to cultivate land under the Tuntian system in Xuxia and obtained one million hu of grain. Therefore, land officials were established in the prefectures and states, and grain was accumulated everywhere. When he conquered the four directions, there was no labor of transporting grain, and he finally destroyed the bandits and pacified the world." The Tuntian policy was learned from the ancients, but Emperor Wu of Han established Tuntian colonies on the frontier, while Cao Cao established Tuntian colonies in the inland prefectures and states. This was because in the Yellow River basin at that time, so many people had died that there was ownerless land everywhere, and therefore it belonged to the public. ("Wei Zhi·Sima Lang Zhuan": "Now, after the great chaos, the people are scattered, and the land is ownerless, all of which are public land.") Cao Cao used this ownerless land to lend to the farmers and also to allow the soldiers to cultivate it. Therefore, there were two types of Tuntian: military Tuntian and civilian Tuntian, but the methods were the same. Those without oxen were lent oxen by the government, and the government received 60% of the harvest, while the private individuals received 40%. Those with oxen divided the harvest equally. Some people say that this was too much exploitation. But we must pay attention to the fact that there were only two levels here: the government and the people, with no private landlords to exploit in the middle. The common people at that time were happy to accept it, and I think there was a reason for it. Another reason was that Cao Cao collected this grain for military needs, for state use, not to fill his own pockets. Cao Cao himself was a very frugal person, not changing his clothes for ten years, mending and washing them every year. Because it was for public use, the military and civilians were also happy to donate and accept his methods.

Although the Tuntian policy adopted established methods and Zao Zhi's suggestions, it was in fact supported by the Yellow Turban peasants and relied on them. The Tuntian decree stated, "When the Yellow Turbans were broken and Xu was settled, the property of the rebels was obtained, and Tuntian should be established." ("Wei Zhi·Ren Jun Zhuan," note quoting "Wei Wu Gu Shi.") The "property" referred to here should refer to the farming tools or a small number of oxen that the Yellow Turban peasants carried with them, and most importantly, the farming techniques of the peasants. The Tuntian policy was built on these foundations. The attack on the Yellow Turbans was in the fourth year of Chuping (193 AD), and the Tuntian was first established in the first year of Jian'an (196 AD). Although three years had passed in between, during these three years, the "more than 1 million men and women" of the Yellow Turban peasants would not have just been eating and sleeping; there was not so much idle food to eat at that time. Therefore, they must have been diligently reclaiming wasteland, but the Tuntian policy was only implemented three years later.

With the Qingzhou soldiers and the Tuntian measures, Cao Cao had the foundation of "sufficient food and sufficient troops," so he was able to gradually defeat and eliminate those armies of prefectures and states that ate mulberries, snails, and human flesh, and gradually sweep away Tao Qian, Lu Bu, Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, and others. Those armies that could "defeat themselves without an enemy" could only fail when they encountered such a strong enemy.

Some people say that Cao Cao was a representative of powerful clans, but according to historical materials, it was not like that. Although he was born into a large landlord family, he opposed the powerful clans of the time. I will not cite many other things, just one example. For example, in the ninth year of Jian'an (204 AD), he destroyed Yuan Shao, and in September he issued an order "emphasizing the law against the powerful and the mergers," so that the people of Hebei did not have to pay the land tax of that year, and the people were happy. The "Wei Shu" recorded his decree:

"Those who have a country or a family are not worried about scarcity but worried about inequality, not worried about poverty but worried about unrest. Under the rule of the Yuan family, the powerful and the strong were allowed to act willfully, relatives merged properties, the lower people were poor and weak, paid taxes on behalf of others, sold family property, and it was not enough to meet the demands. Shen Pei (a person's name)'s clan even hid criminals and became a haven for fugitives; how could they expect the people to be close and the army to be strong? Therefore, the land tax should be four sheng per mu, and each household should pay two bolts of silk and two jin of cotton, and no one else should be allowed to levy taxes without authorization. The governors and prime ministers of the prefectures and states should clearly inspect and ensure that no powerful people hide their property and that the weak people are not burdened with taxes." ("Wei Zhi·Wu Di Ji," note quoting) According to this, Cao Cao was very considerate of the people's feelings and able to win over people's hearts. Winning over people's hearts is not a bad thing; it is much better than "powerful and greedy monopolization" and slaughtering the people to indulge oneself. Therefore, to say that Cao Cao was a representative of the powerful and the strong, or that he colluded with the powerful and the strong to expand his power, I think is inconsistent with historical facts. Of course, he lived one thousand seven or eight hundred years ago, and we cannot expect him to break away from feudal consciousness. But he once made knives with workers, which was criticized by the intellectuals of the time (see "Tai Ping Yu Lan," 346); he was "law for the construction of palaces and the repair of instruments, all of which were done with his intention" ("Wu Di Ji," note quoting "Wei Shu"); it seems that he was able to come into contact with the so-called lower classes and equally valued labor and intellectual work. In fact, he was able to restore the productive order under the feudal system and reverse the situation in which the people were enslaved, which, in terms of the historical development process, was a progressive cause at that time.

What is particularly worth emphasizing is that in the twelfth year of Jian'an (207 AD), in May, he marched thousands of miles to the northeast Liaoning River basin to pacify the three commanderies of Wuhuan, eliminated the main border troubles at that time, and rescued more than 100,000 households of Han people who had been captured and enslaved, totaling several hundred thousand people. So many people needed food along the way. Even the "Cao Man Zhuan," written by the Wu people out of hostile consciousness, said that he had "killed thousands of horses for food," which shows that he valued people more than horses. If we consider the feelings of the hundreds of thousands of people who were rescued, they would have been sincerely grateful to Cao Cao. To say that they regarded Cao Cao as their reborn parents would probably not be an exaggeration, would it?

Cao Cao's pacification of the Wuhuan was an anti-aggression war that was supported by the people

The Wuhuan people were a branch of the Xianbei people. The Wuhuan and Xianbei, these semi-nomadic races, suddenly prospered at the end of the Han Dynasty; according to historical records, their social nature was still in the early stages of slavery. At the end of the Han Dynasty, they often caused trouble on the northern border of China. The Xianbei people occupied the old land of the Northern Xiongnu, and the Wuhuan people occupied the old land of the Southern Xiongnu. At that time, the Northern Xiongnu had already moved west, and the Southern Xiongnu had already submitted, so in Chinese history, the powerful enemies in the north since the Yin and Zhou dynasties, the Xianyun or Xiongnu (Xianyun is Xiongnu, different transliterations of different eras), had been replaced by the Xianbei and Wuhuan at the end of the Han Dynasty.

Cao Cao's pacification of the Wuhuan was an anti-aggression war that was supported by the people. The best evidence is the full support of Tian Chou, an enlightened landlord who protected the people and defended the border in the mountains near Shanhaiguan. Tian Chou often resisted the Wuhuan invasion in peacetime. When Yuan Shao was in power, he refused to go down the mountain despite repeated invitations. When Cao Cao crossed the border and encountered difficulties in his march due to heavy rain, flooding, and impassable roads, he sent someone to hire him, and he immediately went down the mountain to offer advice. His "mountain people" were even more willing to act as guides, crossed the Great Wall to the north, passed through Rehe, and attacked the rear of the Wuhuan. "They dug trenches and filled valleys for more than 500 li," reaching Liucheng (south of Chaoyang County, Liaoning). The enemy was caught off guard, and they finally won an unprecedented victory, eliminating border troubles and rescuing the Han people who had been enslaved. (Please refer to "Wei Zhi·Wu Di Ji" and "Wei Zhi·Tian Chou Zhuan.")

Chairman Mao's poem "Lang Tao Sha," sung at Beidaihe, mentions Cao Cao's conquest of the Wuhuan.

"Heavy rain falls on Youyan, white waves soar to the sky, fishing boats outside Qinhuangdao. A vast expanse is nowhere to be seen, who knows where they've gone? Past events pass a thousand years, Wei Wu wields his whip, East of Jieshi there are lingering chapters. The desolate autumn wind is here again, the world has changed!"

Here there are various associations: heavy rain, place names, the sea, the autumn wind, which are the same as when Cao Cao conquered the Wuhuan. The conquest of the Wuhuan was launched in May, and Taton Shanyu was killed in August. It was late autumn when he returned. Cao Cao's poem "Walking Out of the Summer Gate" mentions "East of Jieshi, to view the vast sea" and "the desolate autumn wind," which is enough to determine that it was written when he returned in triumph. All four poems end with "How fortunate, to sing and express my aspirations," which also proves that he admitted that his victory was "taking advantage of danger and good fortune." Chairman Mao thought of Cao Cao when writing the poem because of the similarity of various objective things, and thought of Cao Cao's eastern expedition against the Wuhuan, which is very worthy of attention. But despite the similarity of various objective things, there is one major difference: "The world has changed!" Cao Cao was an era at that time, and today is another era.

Regarding Cao Cao's eastern expedition against the Wuhuan, the most noteworthy consequence is that he pacified the three commanderies of Wuhuan, and the Hou and Wang lords of the other tribes of Wuhuan were sincerely convinced by him and obeyed his command. The Wuhuan cavalry became the "most famous cavalry in the world" under Cao Cao's command ("Wei Zhi·Wu Wan Zhuan"). It is very difficult to achieve such an effect when war breaks out between races.

In Cao Cao's military achievements, I think these two things are the most amazing. One is that he fought the Yellow Turbans, and the Yellow Turban peasants supported him; the other is that he fought the Wuhuan, and the Wuhuan people obeyed him. If Cao Cao was a bloodthirsty and reckless person, these historical phenomena cannot be explained. Although there are not many detailed records in the history books, we can imagine that he did not simply subdue people by force, but also subdued people by virtue.

Regarding the issue of Cao Cao killing people, it should be reconsidered based on historical facts

Here we cannot avoid touching on the issue of Cao Cao killing people. Some people say that Cao Cao killed too many people, and the main example cited is the defeat of Tao Qian. Here there are some discrepancies in the historical materials. I want to examine the historical materials without being bored with trivial matters. The "Wei Zhi·Tao Qian Zhuan" records it this way:

"In the fourth year of Chuping (193 AD), Emperor Taizu conquered Qian and captured more than ten cities. He arrived at Pengcheng and fought a great battle. Qian's army was defeated and fled, and tens of thousands of people died, so that the Si River did not flow." It is impossible not to die in battle between two armies. The "tens of thousands of people who died" mentioned here are Tao Qian's soldiers. It is possible that they were killed in battle, or they may have been drowned or trampled to death in the defeat, not necessarily all killed by Cao Cao. But this historical fact changed in the "Cao Man Zhuan."

"Since the capital suffered from the chaos of Dong Zhuo, the people moved east and relied on the area around Pengcheng. When Emperor Taizu arrived, he buried tens of thousands of men and women in the Si River, and the water did not flow. Tao Qian led his army to Wu Yuan, Emperor Taizu could not advance, and led his army to attack and capture the counties of Lu, Suiling, and Xiaqiu from the south of the Si River, all of which were slaughtered, and even the chickens and dogs were exhausted. There were no more pedestrians in the ruined towns." ("Wei Zhi·Xun Yu Zhuan," note quoting) This portrayed Cao Cao as a demon king. Interestingly, "soldiers" became "men and women" (the people), "tens of thousands" became "tens of thousands," and death in battle or drowning became "buried alive." Which side should we believe? The "Cao Man Zhuan" was written by the people of Sun Wu, and clearly contains the effect of propaganda against the enemy. Understanding this, we should carefully select historical materials. However, people who do not like Cao Cao are very welcome to the "Cao Man Zhuan," and even feel that it does not say enough. Please see the biography of Tao Qian in the Book of Later Han by Fan Ye of the Liu Song Dynasty.

"In the fourth year of Chuping, Cao Cao attacked Qian and broke Pengcheng Fuyang. Qian retreated to protect Shan, Cao Cao attacked it but could not overcome it, so he returned. He passed through and captured Lu, Suiling, and Xiaqiu, all of which were slaughtered. A total of hundreds of thousands of men and women were killed, with no chickens or dogs remaining, and the Si River did not flow. From then on, there were no more traces of people in the five counties. Initially, the Three Auxiliary Areas suffered from the chaos of Li Jue, and the people who moved and relied on Qian were all annihilated." This is clearly based on the "Cao Man Zhuan" and exaggerates the numbers tenfold, with "tens of thousands of men and women" becoming "hundreds of thousands of men and women." This can truly be said to be a typical distortion by the historian! The bigger the lie, the more popular it is. Sima Guang's "Zizhi Tongjian" adopted the statement of the Book of Later Han, and today many people who scold Cao Cao are happy to have a basis.

Mengzi, more than two thousand years ago (although many people today call him an idealist), was more cautious in the selection of historical materials, and he did not believe the words of "blood flowing and floating pestles" in the "Wu Cheng Pian." He said: "It is better to have no books than to believe everything in books. I only take two or three strategies from 'Wu Cheng.' The benevolent have no enemies in the world. To attack the extremely unbenevolent with the utmost benevolence, how can there be blood flowing and floating pestles?" "To attack the extremely unbenevolent with the utmost benevolence" is problematic. King Wu of Zhou was not "utmost benevolence," and King Zhou of Yin was not "extremely unbenevolent." This should be discussed separately. But Mengzi was able to distinguish between truth and exaggeration, which should be said to be commendable. Our friends today even believe the words "all the chickens and dogs were exhausted."

The Wei Zhi Xun Yu Zhuan records that after Tao Qian's death, Xun Yu advised Cao Cao to slow down the attack on Xuzhou, first harvest the wheat, and attack Lu Bu. Cao Cao listened to him and defeated Lu Bu first. There are a few sentences in Xun Yu's speech:

"Previously, when we attacked Xuzhou, we carried out strict punishments. Their children and brothers remember the shame of their fathers and brothers, they will surely defend themselves, and there is no intention to surrender. Even if they can break it, it is still impossible." It is clear that there are still "children and brothers" of those who died in battle, so how could it be "all the chickens and dogs were exhausted" and "all the people were annihilated"? Such propaganda reminds me of the propaganda of the rulers and landlord class in the early Qing Dynasty about Zhang Xianzhong. They said, "Zhang Xianzhong suppressed Sichuan and killed all the chickens and dogs," but the population of Sichuan today is more than 70 million (including myself), although many are immigrants from other provinces, there are still many natives of Sichuan. Therefore, the words about Cao Cao killing people indiscriminately are worth considering.

Of course, Cao Cao killed people. Not only did he kill people in battle, but he also killed people who violated his laws. What everyone likes to criticize is that he killed Kong Rong (one of the Seven Scholars of Jian'an). Kong Rong was a descendant of Confucius. This gentleman's temperament and opinions were actually quite eccentric. For example, Cao Cao banned alcohol, but Kong Rong insisted on mocking him, saying, "Jie and Zhou lost their countries because of lust, but now you forbid marriage." Cao Cao killed Kong Rong, and it is said that he also killed his two eight-year-old children. This is certainly enough to show Cao Cao's cruelty, but there are also problems here. The "Shi Yu" says:

"Kong Rong's two sons were both young. When Rong was arrested, he turned around and said to his two sons, 'Why don't you avoid it?' The two sons both said, 'My father is still like this, what is there to avoid?' They thought they would all die together." ("Wei Zhi·Cui Yan Zhuan," note quoting)

"They thought they would all die together" is that the two sons thought they would be killed at the same time, but whether they were killed is not explicitly stated. Sun Sheng's "Wei Shi Chunqiu" confirmed that the two sons were "all killed" and embellished it. Pei Songzhi, the annotator of the Records of the Three Kingdoms, criticized it, thinking that "the Shi Yu said that Rong's two sons did not avoid it, knowing that they would all die together, which is still acceptable, how can it be like Sun Sheng's words? ... It is probably due to being fond of strange emotions and not knowing that the words hurt reason."

(All of the above are found in Wei Zhi Cui Yan Zhuan note) When this matter fell into the Kong Rong Zhuan of the Book of Later Han, it was even more exaggerated than Sun Sheng, and it was simply like a novel. Here I do not want to cite more things. Interested friends, please read the original book.

For example, in the stage play "Catching and Releasing Cao" that we often see, it is performed that Cao Cao killed Lu Boshe's family out of suspicion. This is not out of fiction, but based on historical evidence. However, the material on which it is based has problems. The Wei Zhi Wu Di Ji says, "Dong Zhuo appointed Taizu as the Xiaoji Colonel, wanting to discuss matters with him. Taizu then changed his name and secretly returned east." Below this, Pei Songzhi's note cites three kinds of materials, which I will now list below:

"(1) 'Wei Shu' says: Taizu thought that Zhuo would eventually be defeated, so he did not accept the appointment and fled back to his hometown. He passed through his old friend Lu Boshe in Chenggao with several riders. Boshe was not there, and his son and guests robbed Taizu, taking horses and belongings. Taizu killed several people with his own hands.

(2) 'Shi Yu' says: Taizu passed by Boshe, Boshe was traveling, and his five sons were all there, preparing the etiquette for the guest. Taizu thought that he had betrayed Zhuo's order and suspected that they were plotting against him, so he killed eight people with his own sword at night and left.

(3) Sun Sheng's 'Za Ji' says: Taizu heard the sound of their tableware, thought they were plotting against him, so he killed them at night. Afterwards, he said sadly, 'I would rather betray others than have others betray me.' Then he left." This is really how the book changes after three transfers. Judging from the situation, the Wei Shu is more credible, but people who do not like Cao Cao naturally especially chose Sun Sheng, the gentleman who is "fond of strange emotions and does not know that the words hurt reason." The words "I would rather betray others than have others betray me" should be Sun Sheng's words, not Cao Cao's words. Cao Cao was especially distorted, and these gentlemen who were "fond of strange emotions" should be responsible.

Of course, Cao Cao also made mistakes, wrongly killing good people. We do not want to defend him one by one. For example, it was wrong of him to kill Hua Tuo. According to historical records, Hua Tuo was just hiding at home for reasons and refused to treat Cao Cao's illness; this alone was not enough to be sentenced to death. He also sometimes put people in prison in a moment of anger, and later forgave him. Jia Kui is one example (see "Wei Zhi·Jia Kui Zhuan," note quoting "Wei Lue"). There should also be some or many people who died unjustly because he did not have time to forgive them.

He also had good intentions, but he was too eager and ruined things. The biggest thing was that in the eighteenth year of Jian'an (213 AD), when Cao Cao attacked Sun Quan, "fearing that the counties on the river would be plundered by Quan, he ordered them to move inland, and the people were alarmed. From Lujiang, Jiujiang, Qichun, and Guangling, more than 100,000 households crossed the river to the east. Jiangxi was then emptied, and south of Hefei, there was only Wancheng" (Wu Zhi·Sun Quan Zhuan). This is what the Wei Zhi Yuan Huan Zhuan says: "At that time, new people were recruited to open Tuntian fields, but the people were not happy and many fled." But Cao Cao listened to Yuan Huan's suggestion not to force the people, "those who are willing to take it, and those who do not want it should not be forced," so "the people were very happy." It can be seen that many of the more than 100,000 households who "crossed the river to the east" later returned, and Jiangxi was temporarily emptied, but not for long. But some people, seeing the collective flight of the peasants, negated the positive significance of the Tuntian policy. This is not seeing the problem from a comprehensive perspective and should be considered "attacking one point and not counting the rest."

In short, Cao Cao made many mistakes and lost many battles. He had many shortcomings, but he also had many advantages. He was able to correct his mistakes and was good at learning lessons from failures, which was also his great advantage. He lived one thousand seven or eight hundred years ago. According to historical records, he was able to disbelieve in fate, disbelieve in ghosts and gods, destroy evil shrines, break superstitions, prohibit thick burials, prohibit private revenge, punish without avoiding the powerful and the nobles, recommend talented people and promote the humble, and dare to publicly order the selection of people who were called "unbenevolent and unfilial but had the art of governing the country and using troops." After he defeated Yuan Shao at Guandu in the fifth year of Jian'an, he burned all the documents he found from the enemy's documents, including the correspondence from Xuxia and people in the army to Yuan Shao, and did not pursue them. According to these, he was really enlightened and confident enough. As for his versatility, he was a multifaceted talent; he "commanded the army for more than 30 years and never put down his book," and was a scholar; he not only had military achievements, but also valued literary governance. The high tide of Jian'an literature was formed under the encouragement of Cao Cao and his sons; many friends have said it, and I am not going to say more here.

Cao Cao made great contributions to the development of the nation and the development of culture

To evaluate a historical figure, we should look at the problem comprehensively, weigh the importance of his major virtues, and especially see whether he made contributions to the people at that time and whether he made contributions to the development of our entire nation and the development of culture. Fairly speaking, Cao Cao made contributions to the people at that time, not only did he make contributions, but they were also great; he made contributions to the development of the nation and the development of culture, not only did he make contributions, but they were also great. In my opinion, Cao Cao's contributions in these areas were the greatest compared to the people of his time. For example, Zhuge Liang is a person who should be affirmed, but the Western Shu that he relied on was not greatly damaged at that time, and the scale of his achievements was much smaller than that of Cao Cao. However, Zhuge Liang was deified by later generations, while Cao Cao was demonized by later generations. This is not fair. The main reason for this unfairness or the special distortion of Cao Cao cannot but be attributed to the dominance of the concept of legitimacy.

Recently, I read Mr. Wang Kunlun's "Cao Cao in History and Cao Cao on the Stage," in which he cited Su Dongpo's "Zhi Lin":

"The little children in the streets and alleys are inferior, and their families are disgusted and suffer. They often give money to gather together to sit and listen to ancient stories. When it comes to the story of the Three Kingdoms, when they hear that Liu Xuande was defeated, they frown and some shed tears. When they hear that Cao Cao was defeated, they rejoice and sing quickly." He believes that using Cao Cao as a negative example is not entirely due to the dominance of legitimacy, but is "the choice of the broad masses of the people for many years." He wants us not to "ignore" the latter point. Yes, for many years the broad masses of the people have chosen Cao Cao as a negative example. But the question is: how many years is "many years"? If it is said to be since the Zhao and Song dynasties, it should be admitted. Therefore, a further question can be raised: is the people's choice of Cao Cao as a negative example "their own choice"? According to what we know, people who lived in the same era as Cao Cao did not hate Cao Cao, and some even said: "I would rather be a slave of Duke Wei than a superior guest of Liu Bei" (see Wei Shu·Wen Di Ji note quoting Xian Di Chuan).

Cao Cao's ministers, such as Wang Can, and his sons, such as Cao Zhi, praised Cao Cao to the sky in their eulogistic articles, which we do not need to cite. But Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin, has an "Eulogy to Emperor Taizu of Wei" ("Quan Tang Wen," volume 10), which is worth noting. He calls Cao Cao a "philosopher" and says that he "used his heroic posture to face the difficult times; the burden of the pillar is the same as in the past, and the merit of helping is different from the past." He said that he saved the drowning and supported the overturned. In our opinion, these words are close to historical truth. An interesting piece of evidence that the Tang Dynasty did not deny Cao Cao is that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang called himself "Aman." If the people in the Tang Dynasty had already regarded Cao Cao as a big villain, how could the emperor of the dynasty use the nickname of a big villain to mock himself? This is unimaginable.

Cao Cao has been greatly distorted, and it is really since the Song Dynasty. I don't think it's good to casually attribute the responsibility to the people for its source. Mr. Wang Kunlun said: "Probably the change of public opinion starts from the people first." This statement is very problematic if it is generalized because there is a lot to do in the word "probably." In my opinion, the essence of democracy generally starts from the people, but the dross of feudalism should not be the responsibility of the people. For example, the saying "Huang Chao killed eight million people, and those who were in the robbery could not escape" is widely circulated among the people, and its source is undoubtedly from the ruling class. If it is considered to be the people's own consciousness because the broad masses of the people have said that for many years, then things will not be easy to handle because whoever wants to remove the dross of feudalism will become opposed to the people's consciousness. In fact, the consciousness of the people in the feudal era, except for the revolutionary democratic essence, we should affirm, is deliberately cultivated by the ruling class. Only those with relatively strong revolutionary qualities can get rid of the control of that ideology. Cao Cao's image of a white-faced treacherous official has almost become an irremovable iron case on the stage and in the minds of the people. However, there was a leader of a peasant uprising who wanted to move this iron case hundreds of years ago. Luo Rucai, who rose up at the

    替曹操翻安
    郭沫若
    曹操虽然打了黄巾，但没有违背黄巾起义的目的
    曹操打过东汉末年的农民起义军——黄巾，这是历史事实。这可以说是曹操一生中最不光采的一页。
    在今天的问题是：打过农民起义军的曹操，是不是就应该受千年万代的咒骂？
    在东汉末年打过黄巾的不止曹操一个人，刘备、孙坚、袁绍、袁术和其他的人都打过。
    再把历史范围说广泛一点。汉光武刘秀打过赤眉、铜马，唐太宗李世民打过窦建德、刘武周，汉高祖刘邦和楚霸王项羽同是起义军的领袖而互相打，明太祖朱元璋坐天下，不是从元人手里直接打下来的，而主要是从先后起义者的手里打下来的。
    因此，问题倒应该进一步看看：曹操打了黄巾义军之后的后果如何？
    在我看来，曹操虽然打了黄巾，但并没有违背黄巾起义的目的。黄巾起义的目的是什么呢？那就是人民要粮食，要土地，要活下去。在东汉末年，人民的衣食之源，被腐朽的王朝和一些皇亲国戚、宦官豪右所垄断，他们互相残杀，使人民遭受惨酷苦役，脱离土地，不能聊生；甚至闹到如曹操的诗所描写的“千里无鸡鸣，生民百遗一”（见“蒿里行”）的地步。人民要活下去，所以不得不起义。
    但要怎样才可以达到起义的目的呢？那就应该要有比较好的军事组织。如果只是乌合之众，前途是可以预见的：不是逐步消亡，便是逐步变质。
    当时黄巾义军的组织情况又是怎样呢？实在很差。人数是很多的，一起就是几十万或者百多万，但“群辈相随，军无辎重，唯以钞略为资”（“魏志·武帝纪”鲍信语），这就是说男女老少都伙在一道，没有军粮，只是走一路吃一路。这样的军事行动是断难持久的。
    这情况倒不限于黄巾义军，当时中国北部是普遍缺粮，就是郡国的所谓官兵也同样是些乌合之众。遗失了的“魏书”有这样的叙述：
    “自遭荒乱，率乏粮谷。诸军并起，无终岁之计。饥则寇略，饱则弃余。瓦解流离、无敌自破者不可胜数。袁绍之在河北，军人仰食桑椹，袁术在江淮，取给蒲赢（?螺）。民人相食，州里萧条。”（“魏志·武帝纪”建安元年注引）乌合之众的所谓官军都是“瓦解流离、无敌自破”，黄巾义师又何能免？五斗米教魁张角弟兄的失败，其主要原因就在这里。袁绍的军人有桑椹时吃桑椹，袁术的军人有?螺时吃?螺，这些东西吃完了或者没有的时候怎么办呢？那不是就只好人吃人了。因此刘备的部下吃过人肉，曹操的部下也同样，这是在史书上有记载的。
    和军事行动不可分开的必须有粮食，这是常识问题。故“足食足兵”是相联带的事。有兵无食，除自然瓦解之外也还可以产生“有奶便是娘”的现象。黄巾义军有的依附过袁术或者孙坚，有的甚至保护过皇帝，请看下引的两项史料：
    建安元年春正月汝南“黄巾何仪、刘辟、黄邵、何曼等众各数万，初应袁术，又附孙坚。”（“魏志·武帝纪”）兴平二年十一月汉献帝东迁，途中“杨奉、董承引白波帅胡才、李乐、韩暹及匈奴右贤王去卑（原误为“左贤王”，今改正）率师奉迎，与李傕等战，破之”。（白波即起义于白波谷的黄巾义师。）“后汉书·献帝纪”）这难道不是变了质？农民起义军竟和强宗豪右甚至于和皇帝都合流起来了！
    然而曹操虽然打了黄巾，他确是把黄巾进行了组织化。初平三年（公元193年）冬，他击破黄巾于寿张东，追至济北，黄巾乞降，于是“受降卒三十余万，男女百余万口，收其精锐者号为青州兵。”（“魏志·武帝纪”）这就是曹操起家的武力基础。就和汉光武打破了铜马，而被铜马义军拥戴为“铜马帝”一样，曹操是被拥戴成为了青州兵的领袖。我们可以想想：如果曹操完全是嗜杀成性、胡作非为的人，那几十万的青州兵、百多万的农民男女，怎么能够听他指挥呢？不是倒过来把他干掉，便尽可以一哄而散，然而不是这样。那就值得我们把所谓历史定案重新审核审核一下了。
    曹操具有军事天才和组织本领是无可否认的。黄巾义师确实是经过了他的组织而免掉了“瓦解流离”之患，史实如此，不好抹杀。
    曹操有了青州兵，但还有一个重大问题没有同时解决，那就是军粮的问题。这个问题推迟了三年，在建安元年（196年），终于被解决了。那就是他采用了枣祗、韩浩的建议兴立屯田。上引“魏书”在“民人相食，州里萧条”之下的文字是：
    “公曰，夫定国之术在于强兵足食。秦人以急农兼天下，孝武以屯田定西域，此先代之良式也。是岁（建安元年）乃募民屯田许下，得谷百万斛。于是州郡例置田官，所在积谷。征伐四方，无运粮之劳，遂兼灭群贼，克平天下。”屯田政策是从古人学来的，但汉武帝是开边屯田，而曹操是在内地郡国普遍屯田。这是由于当时的黄河流域，人民死亡得太厉害了，到处是无主之地，因而也就归公家所有。（“魏志·司马朗传”：“今承大乱之后，民人分散，土业无主，皆为公田。”）曹操便利用了这些无主之地来贷给农民，也使军人垦辟。故屯田有军屯、民屯两种，但办法是一样的。无牛者，公家贷牛，所获公家得六成，私人得四成。有牛者，所获平分。有人说，这剥削得太厉害。但我们要注意，在这里只有官和民两层，没有中间剥削的私人地主。当时的老百姓乐于接受，我看是有道理的。还有一个原因，那就是曹操征收这些粮食来是为的军需，为的国用，不是以饱私囊。曹操自己是非常俭朴的人，衣被十年不换，每年缝补浣洗。为了公用，所以军民也乐于捐输而接受了他的办法。
    屯田政策虽然是采取成法和枣祗的建议，但事实上是得到黄巾农民的支持，而且倚靠了他们。屯田令云“及破黄巾，定许，得贼资业，当兴立屯田”。（“魏志·任峻传”注引“魏武故事”。）这所说的“资业”应该指的是黄巾农民所随身带走的耕具或者少数的耕牛，而最重要的是农民的耕种技术。屯田政策是建立在这些基础之上的。攻破黄巾是在初平四年（193年），而开始兴立屯田是在建安元年（196年），中间虽然相隔三年，在这三年当中那“男女百余万口”的黄巾农民是不会只是吃饭睡觉的，当时也没有那么多的闲饭来吃。所以他们一定是勤勤恳恳地在垦辟荒土，只是屯田政策是迟了三年才见诸实施而已。
    有了青州兵，有了屯田措施，这在曹操说来就具有了“足食足兵”的基础，所以他能够逐步打败和消灭那些吃桑椹、吃?螺、吃人肉的郡国之师，把陶谦、吕布、袁绍、袁术等都逐步扫荡了。那些可以“无敌自破”的军队遇到了这样的劲敌，当然是只好失败的。
    有人说曹操是强宗豪右的代表，但从史料上看来并不是那样。他虽然是大地主出身，但却反对当时的强宗豪右。别的不多事征引，单举一例吧。例如建安九年（204年）他把袁绍破灭了，九月就下令“重豪强兼并之法”，使河北人民无出当年的租赋，人民都高兴。“魏书”记载了他的令文：
    “有国有家者不患寡而患不均，不患贫而患不安。袁氏之治也，使豪强擅恣，亲戚兼并，下民贫弱，代出租赋，衒鬻家财，不足应命。审配（人名）宗族，至乃藏匿罪人，为逋逃主；欲望百姓亲附、甲兵强盛，岂可得耶？其收田租亩四升，户出绢二匹、绵二斤而已，他不得擅兴发。郡国守相，明检察之，无令强民有所隐藏、而弱民兼赋也。”（魏志·武帝纪注引）。据此看来，曹操是很能够体贴民情，而收揽人心的。收揽人心并不是坏事，比“豪右辜榷”（垄断之意）、屠民以逞的好得多。所以要说曹操是豪右的代表，或者结纳豪右以扩张自己的权势，我看是和史实不符的。当然，他生在一千七八百年前，我们也不能希望他脱离封建意识。但他曾经和工人一道打刀，为当时的知识分子所非难（见“太平御览”346）；他对于“造作宫室、缮治器械，无不为之法则，皆尽其意”（“武帝纪”注引“魏书”）；看来，他倒能和所谓下层群众相接触，是同等重视劳力与劳心的人。事实上他能够恢复封建制度下的生产秩序，把人民被奴役的情况扭回过来，从历史发展过程上来说，在当时倒是进步的事业。
    特别值得强调的是他在建安十二年（207年）五月，千里远征，一直到东北辽河流域去平定了三郡乌桓，消除了当时主要的边患，而救回了被俘掳去做奴隶的汉民十余万户，总得有好几十万人。这样多的人沿途是要粮食吃的，连出于敌对意识、由吴人写成的“曹瞒传”，都说他曾经“杀马数千匹以为粮”，可见他是重人不重马。我们如果体贴一下那被解救了的十几万户人的心理，他们对于曹操是会衷心感激的。要说他们把曹操当成重生父母，恐怕不会是过分的吧？
    曹操平定乌桓是反侵略性的战争，得到人民的支持
    乌桓人是鲜卑人的一支。乌桓和鲜卑，这些半游牧性的种族，在汉末突然兴盛了起来；他们的社会性质，据史籍所载，还是在奴隶制的初期。他们在汉末经常为患于中国的北边，鲜卑人占领了北匈奴的旧地，乌桓人占领了南匈奴的旧地。当时的北匈奴已经西迁，南匈奴已经内附，故在中国历史上自殷周以来的北方的强敌玁允或者匈奴（玁允即匈奴，是时代不同的音译），在汉末已经换成为鲜卑乌桓了。
    曹操的平定乌桓是反侵略性的战争，是得到人民支持的。最好的证据就是当时的一位在山海关附近的山上保境安民的开明地主田畴的全力支持。田畴平时即经常抵抗乌桓的侵略，当袁绍在时尽管屡次请他下山，他都拒绝了。待曹操一过境，在行军上遇着困难，由于大雨，河水泛滥、道路不通，遣人去聘请他，他便立地下山献策。他的“山民”更乐意作向导，北越长城，经过热河，去抄击乌桓的后路。“堑山湮谷五百余里”，一直达到柳城（辽宁朝阳县南）。使敌人措手不及，终于获得了空前的胜利，消泯了边患，救回了被奴役的汉民。（请参看“魏志·武帝纪”及“魏志·田畴传”）
    毛主席咏北戴河的一首词“浪淘沙”，是提到了曹操征乌桓这件事的。
    “大雨落幽燕，白浪滔天，秦皇岛外打鱼船。一片汪洋都不见，知向谁边？往事越千年，魏武挥鞭，东临碣石有遗篇。萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间！”
    这里有种种的联想，太雨、地望、沧海、秋风，和曹操征乌桓时是相同的。征乌桓是五月出征，八月斩蹋顿单于，回军的时候是暮秋了。曹操的“步出夏门行”一诗中提到“东临碣石，以观沧海”、“秋风萧瑟”，足以断定是回军凯旋时做的。一连四首都是以“幸甚至哉，歌以咏志”作结语，也可以证明他自认他的胜利是“乘危以侥幸”的。毛主席在写词时因种种客观事物的相同而想到曹操，想到曹操的东征乌桓，这是很值得注意的。但尽管有种种客观事物相同，而却有一件最大的不同。那就是“换了人间”！曹操当时是一个时代，而今天又是另一个时代了。
    关于曹操的东征乌桓，还有最值得注意的后果是：他把三郡乌桓平定了，而乌桓的其他部落的侯王大人们却对他心悦诚服，服从他的指挥。乌桓的骑兵，在曹操麾下成为了“天下名骑”（“魏志·乌丸传”）。在种族之间发生了战争，能够收到这样的效果，是很不容易的事。
    在曹操的武功中，我看就有这两件事体最值得惊异。一件是他打了黄巾，而黄巾农民拥戴他；另一件是他打了乌桓，而乌桓人民服从他。如果曹操是嗜杀成性、胡作非为的人，这样的历史现象是无法说明的。史书上虽没有多的详细的记载，但我们可以推想得到：他不是纯粹地以力服人，而是同时在以德服人。
    关于曹操杀人问题，应该根据历史事实重新考虑
    在这里不能不接触到曹操杀人的问题。有的人说曹操杀人太多，引用的例证主要是打败陶谦的那一件。在这里史料上是有些出入的，不厌烦琐，想把史料来检查一下。“魏志·陶谦传”上是这样纪载的：
    “初平四年（193年）太祖征谦，攻拔十余城。至彭城，大战。谦兵败走，死者万数，泗水为之不流。”两军交战是不能不死人的。这儿所说的“死者万数”是陶谦的兵。这里有可能是战死的，也有可能是在败走中被水淹死或者自相践踏而死的，不一定都是曹操所杀。但这项史实落在“曹瞒传”里却变了样。
    “自京师遭董卓之乱，人民流移东出，多依彭城间。遇太祖至，坑杀男女数万口于泗水，水为不流。陶谦帅其众军武原，太祖不得进，引军从泗南攻取虑、睢陵、夏丘诸县，皆屠之，鸡犬亦尽。墟邑无复行人。”（魏志·荀彧传注引）这把曹操写成了一个混世魔王。很有趣的是“兵”变成了“男女”（人民群众），“万数”变成了“数万”，战死或者淹死变成了“坑杀”。我们到底应该相信那一边呢？“曹瞒传”是孙吴的人做的，明显地包含有对敌宣传作用在里面，了解到这一点我们对于史料就应该慎重选择了。但是，不高兴曹操的人却十分欢迎“曹瞒传”，而且还嫌他说得不够劲。请看刘宋时代的人范晔的后汉书陶谦传吧。
    “初平四年曹操击谦，破彭城傅阳，谦退保剡，操攻之不能克，乃还。过拔取虑、睢陵、夏丘，皆屠之。凡杀男女数十万人，鸡犬无余，泗水为之不流。自是五县城保无复行迹。初三辅遭李傕乱，百姓流移依谦者皆歼。”这分明是根据“曹瞒传”，而把数目字又夸大了十倍，“男女数万”变成为“男女数十万”了。这真可以说是作史者典型的曲笔！谎愈扯愈大，却愈受人欢迎。司马光的“资治通鉴”便采取了“后汉书”的说法，今天好些骂曹操的人也就乐于有根据了。
    两千多年前的孟子（尽管在今天有不少人斥他为唯心主义者），他在史料的选择上就比较审慎，他就不相信“武成篇”的“血流漂杵”的话。他说：“尽信书则不如无书，吾于‘武成’取二三策而已矣。仁人无敌于天下，以至仁伐至不仁，而何其血之流杵也？”“以至仁伐至不仁”是有问题的，周武王并不是“至仁”，殷纣王也并不是“至不仁”，这当别论。但孟子能够分别真实与虚夸，应该说是可取的。我们今天的朋友们却连“鸡犬亦尽”的话都信以为真了。
    魏志荀彧传载陶谦死后荀彧劝曹操缓攻徐州，先收麦，并攻打吕布。曹操听从了他，先把吕布打败了。荀彧的说辞里面有这样几句：
    “前讨徐州，威罚实行。其子弟念父兄之耻，必人自为守，无降心，就能破之，尚不可有也。”明明还有战死者的“子弟”，哪里就会是
  “鸡犬亦尽”，“百姓皆歼”呢？这样的宣传令我想到清初的统治者和地主阶级关于张献忠的宣传。他们说“张献忠剿四川，杀得鸡犬不留”，然而四川人口在今天却有七千多万（包含我自己在内），虽然有好些是后来外省的移民，然而也有不少人是四川的土著。因此，关于曹操乱杀人的话也就值得我们考虑考虑了。
    当然曹操是杀过人的，不仅打仗要杀人，和他的法令相抵触的人他也杀过。大家喜欢指责的是他杀了孔融（建安七子中的一子）。孔融是孔夫子的后人，这位先生的性情和主张其实都是相当乖僻的。例如曹操禁酒，而孔融偏要嘲笑他，说“桀纣以色亡国，今令不禁婚姻”。曹操杀了孔融，据说又把他两个八岁的小孩子也杀了。这当然也足以表示曹操的残忍，但这里也是有问题的。“世语”云：
    “融二子皆龆齓。融见收，顾谓二子曰何以不辟？二子俱曰父尚如此，复何所辟？以为必俱死也。”（魏志·崔琰传注引）
    “以为必俱死也”是二子自以为必将同时被杀，但是否杀了，并无明文。孙盛“魏氏春秋”却肯定了二子“俱见杀”，并加以渲染。三国志注者晋人裴松之曾加以批评，以为“世语云融二子不辟，知必俱死，犹差可，安如孙盛之言？……盖由好奇情多，而不知言之伤理。”
  （以上俱见魏志崔琰传注）这事落到后汉书孔融传里，也比孙盛更加夸大，简直类似小说了。在这里我不想多事征引，感兴趣的朋友，请去翻读原书。
    又如我们在舞台上经常看到的“捉放曹”，表演曹操出于猜疑，把吕伯奢的一家人杀了。这并不是出于虚构，是有根据的。然而所根据的材料却有问题。魏志武帝纪云“董卓表太祖为骁骑校尉，欲与计事。太祖乃变易姓名，间行东归。”在这下边裴松之的注征引了三种资料，我现在把它们并列在下边：
    “（1）‘魏书’曰太祖以卓终必复败，遂不就拜，逃归乡里。从数骑过故人成皋吕伯奢。伯奢不在，其子与宾客共劫太祖，取马及物。太祖手刃击杀数人。
    （2）‘世语’曰太祖过伯奢，伯奢出行，五子皆在，备宾主礼。太祖自以背卓命，疑其图己，手剑夜杀八人而去。
    （3）孙盛‘杂记’曰太祖闻其食器声，以为图己，遂夜杀之。既而凄怆曰‘宁我负人，无人负我’。遂行。”这真是书经三转就变了样。照情理上看来，魏书是比较可信的，但是不高兴曹操的人自然特别选中了孙盛，这位“好奇情多，而不知言之伤理”的先生。“宁我负人，无人负我”的话应该是孙盛的话，而不是曹操的话。曹操特别受了歪曲，这些“好奇情多”的先生是应该负责的。
    当然，曹操也有犯错误的时候，错杀了好人，我们并不想一一替他辩护。例如他把华佗杀了，总是不该的。按照史书所述，华佗只是托故躲在家里，不肯替曹操治病；单只这一点并不至于犯死罪。他也有时在一时盛怒之下收人入狱，后来又原恕了他。贾逵就是一例（见
  “魏志·贾逵传”注引“魏略”）。来不及原恕而冤死了的人应该也是有的或者还不少。
    他也有出于好心肠，但操之太切，而把事情办坏了的。最大的一件事是建安十八年（213年）曹操攻孙权，“恐江滨郡县为权所略，征令内移，民转相惊。自庐江、九江、蕲春、广陵，户十余万，皆东渡江。江西遂虚，合肥以南惟有皖城”（吴志·孙权传）。这就是魏志袁涣传里所说的“是时新募民开屯田，民不乐，多逃亡”。但曹操听了袁涣的建议对于人民不要强迫，“乐之者乃取，不欲者勿强”，于是“百姓大悦”。可见“东渡江”的十余万户其后是有不少人回来的，江西虚了一时，不至于长久虚下去。但有人看到农民的集体逃亡，便否定屯田政策的积极意义。这是没有从全面来看问题，要算是“攻其一点，不计其余”了。
    总之，曹操是犯过不少次错误，也打过不少次败仗的，他的缺点不少，但优点也很多。他能够改正错误，善于从失败中取得教训，也就是他很大的优点。他是一千七八百年前的人，据史书所载，他能够不信天命，不信鬼神，毁灭邪祠，破除迷信，禁止厚葬，禁止复私仇，诛不避权贵，举能扬侧陋，敢于公开下令要选用被人称为“不仁不孝而有治国用兵之术”的人；建安五年他败袁绍于官渡之后，从所收获的敌方文书中把许下和军中人给袁绍的通信都烧掉了，不加追究；据这些看来，他实在也算得是够开明，够有自信的。至于他多才多艺，是一位多面手；他“御军三十余年、手不舍书”，是一位博学家；他不仅有武功，而且重文治，建安文学的高潮是在曹操父子的鼓舞下形成的；好些朋友都说过，我在这里就不准备多说了。
    曹操对于民族的发展和文化的发展有大的贡献
    我们评价一位历史人物，应该从全面来看问题，应该从他的大节上来权其轻重，特别要看他对于当时的人民有无贡献，对于我们整个民族的发展、文化的发展有无贡献。公平地说来，曹操对于当时的人民是有贡献的，不仅有而且大；对于民族的发展和文化的发展是有贡献的，不仅有而且大。在我看来，曹操在这些方面的贡献，比起他同时代的人物来是最大的。例如诸葛亮是应该肯定的人物，但他所凭借的西蜀，在当时没有遭到多大的破坏，而他所成就的规模比起曹操来要小得多。然而诸葛亮却被后人神化，而曹操被后人魔鬼化了。这是不公平的。其所以产生这种不公平或者使曹操特别遭受歪曲的最主要原因不能不归之于正统观念的统治。
    最近我读到王昆仑先生的“历史上的曹操和舞台上的曹操”，他援引了苏东坡的“志林”，
  “涂巷中小儿薄劣，其家所厌苦，辄与钱令聚坐听说古话。至说三国事，闻刘玄德败，辄蹙眉，有出涕者，闻曹操败，即喜唱快。”他认为把曹操作为反面教员，不完全由于正统主义的支配，而是“多少年来广大人民自己的选择”。他要我们不要把后一点“忽略了”。是的，多少年来广大人民是把曹操选为了反面教员。但问题是：这“多少年”究竟有多少年？如果说是自赵宋以来，那是应该承认的。因而也就可以进一步再提出一个问题：人民选曹操为反面教员究竟是不是出于“自己的选择”？据我们所知道的，和曹操同时代的人却也并不痛恨曹操，甚而有人说：“宁为魏公奴，不为刘备上客”（见魏书·文帝纪注引献帝传）。
    曹操的臣下如王粲，儿子如曹植，他们的歌功颂德的文章，把曹操捧上了天，我们且不必征引。但唐太宗李世民有一篇“祭魏太祖文”（见“全唐文”卷十），是值得注意的。他称曹操为“哲人”，说他“以雄武之姿，当艰难之运；栋梁之任同乎曩时，匡匹之功异于往代”；说他拯救了沉溺，扶持了颠复。这些话，在我们看来，倒是接近于历史真实的。唐代没有否定曹操还有一个有趣的证据，便是唐玄宗自名为“阿瞒”。如果唐代的民间已经把曹操当成一个大坏蛋，一朝的天子哪里会把大坏蛋的小名来嘲骂自己呢？这是不能想像的。
    曹操受了很大的歪曲，实在是自宋代以来。其来源我觉得不好随便把责任归诸人民。王昆仑先生说：“大概舆论的变化就从民间先开始”，这话如果一般化了，就很成问题。因为在“大概”一辞中就大有文章可做。据我的看法，民主性的精华大抵是从民间开始的，而封建性的糟粕则不好让人民来负责。例如说“黄巢杀人八百万，在劫者难逃”，这话在民间流传得广泛得很，其来源无疑是出于统治阶级。如果因为多少年来广大人民那样说，而认为是人民自己的意识，那事情就不好办。因为谁要剔除封建性的糟粕，那就会成为反对人民意识了。其实，人民在封建时代的意识，除掉革命的民主性的精华之外，我们应该肯定，是支配阶级蓄意培植的。只有革命性比较强的人才能摆脱那种意识形态的控制。曹操的粉脸奸臣的形象，在舞台上，在人民心目中，差不多成为了难移的铁案了。然而在几百年前也有农民起义的领袖想移动一下这个铁案。和李自成、张献忠同时起义的罗汝才，他自号为“曹操王”，不就表明草莽英雄中也有不愿意为“三国演义”所束缚的人物存在吗？
    “三国演义”是一部好书，我们并不否认；但它所反映的是封建意识，我们更没有办法来否认。艺术真实性和历史真实性是不能够判然分开的，我们所要求的艺术真实性是要在历史真实性的基础上而加以发扬。罗贯中写“三国演义”时，他是根据封建意识来评价三国人物，在他并不是存心歪曲，而是根据他所见到的历史真实性来加以形象化的。但在今天，我们的意识不同了，真是“萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间”了！罗贯中所见到的历史真实性就成了问题，因而“三国演义”的艺术真实性也就失掉了基础。这是无可如何的。尽管还有相当长的一个时期人们还会相信“三国演义”的真实性，但那是会逐渐淡薄的。在今天桃园三结义的形象已经不如往年那样神气了。我们可以预言曹操的粉脸也会逐渐被人民翻案的。今天不是已经在开始翻案了吗？
    旧剧中的曹操形象主要是根据“三国演义”的观点来形成的。要替曹操翻案须得从我们的观点中所见到的历史真实性来从新塑造。如果在旧戏的粉脸中透出一点红色来，解决不了问题。例如以“赤壁之战”而言，在史籍上就有不同的说法。曹操遗孙权书云“赤壁之役，值有疾病，孤烧船自退，横使周瑜虚获此名”（见“吴志·周瑜传”注引“江表传”）。“魏志·武帝纪”也说“公至赤壁，与备战不利，于是大疫，吏士多死者，乃引军还。”到底哪一边是历史真实呢？我们很难判断。但曹操在赤壁之战是打败了，那是没有问题的。三分鼎足之所以形成，在我看来，地理形势要算是一个重要原因。西蜀是得到山岳的屏障，孙吴是得到长江的保护。但尽管这样，魏蜀吴都是想中国成为一统的。本是统一的中国不愿意成为群雄割据的局面，这是三国人物的普遍心理。所不同的只是：不让你来统一，让我来统一，如此而已。诸葛亮的“汉贼不两立，王业不偏安”，不就是很坦白的自述吗？
    但有人认为“三国的分立是有其社会经济原因的。……曹操在统一北方后所进行的扩张战争，是违背历史规律和人民愿望的”。这见解真是非常奇特。三国的社会经济，我们丝毫也看不出有什么根本上的不同。曹操在南征，诸葛亮和孙吴都屡次在北伐，南征如果是“违背历史规律和人民愿望”，北伐也同样是“违背历史规律和人民愿望”。愿意中国分裂而不愿意统一，这算什么“历史规律”！这算什么
  “人民愿望”！以前的读书人有一种毛病：“好读书、不求甚解”；今天的读书人似乎有人又有一种毛病：“不读书、好求甚解”。我们好不好来一个辩证的统一：“好读书、好求甚解”呢？我们须得知道：曹操生前虽然没有完成统一中国的大业，但在他死后不足五十年终于由他所组织起来的力量把中国统一了。这却是无可动摇的历史事实！
    曹操冤枉地做了一千多年的反面教员，在今天，要替他恢复名誉
    曹操冤枉地做了一千多年的反面教员，我们在今天是要替他恢复名誉。但我们也知道，这不是一件容易的事，因为积重难返。历史上应该恢复名誉的人物，如殷纣王，如秦始皇，要翻案都比较困难。原因是对于他们的敌性宣传太年长岁远，深入人心。而尤其是曹操，由于“三国演义”和三国戏的普及，三岁小儿都把他当成了大坏蛋，要翻案是特别不容易的。王安石是同样受极大歪曲的历史人物，他的案是翻过来了。他的幸运是对于他的敌性宣传只限于知识分子，没有曹操所受的影响那么普遍，妇孺皆知。但长远地把一位好人作为反面教员总是不大妥当的。我们搞历史的人有责任把真实性弄清楚。但我们也并不主张把“三国演义”烧掉、把三国戏停演或者一一加以修改，我们却希望有人能在用新观点所见到的历史真实性的基础之上来进行新的塑造。新旧可以共存，听从人民选择。
    关于曹操的功过，还有一个问题今天虽然没有人提到，但在古书上却有人早提到了。那就是民族问题。曹操的民族政策除掉必要时进行反抗战争之外，基本上是采取各族融和的办法的。鲜卑乌桓人为他所用，匈奴人与汉族杂居于河东，因而有人把西晋末年的“五胡乱华”隐隐归罪于曹操。例如唐章怀太子李贤注“后汉书·南匈奴传”便有这样的话：
    “自单于比入居西河美稷（今内蒙古乌克昭盟一带）之后，种类繁昌，难以驱逼。魏武虽分其众为五部，然大率皆居晋阳。暨乎左賢王豹之子刘元海，假称天号，纵盗中原，吞噬神乡，丘墟帝宅，愍怀二帝沉没虏庭。差之毫端，一至于此，百代无灭，诚可痛心也。他虽然不是专门在责备魏武帝，而主要是在责备窦宪，但魏武是承继了窦宪的混处政策的。那么“五胡乱华”的责任，在魏武帝似乎也就不能不分负了。这样的归罪也是很值得商兑的。
    “五胡乱华”的诱因并不是由于民族混居，而是由于西晋的内乱。司马氏夺取了曹魏政权之后，不再传便有“八王之乱”，大家抢做皇帝，相互斫杀了十六年。内乱的结果因而便诱致了“五胡”的崛起。
    “八王之乱”又是怎样产生的呢？这是由于制度的改革。汉朝的郡国制度，国的诸侯王是没有实权的，实权是操在中央所委派的国相手里。魏因汉制，诸侯王同样无实权，司马氏因而得以篡位。司马氏一夺取了政权之后，为了巩固本姓的王朝便把制度改革了。办法是大封公族，使各侯王得以任官分治，征兵自卫。用心是在防止异姓篡夺，但谁知道却招致了同姓纷争，而终于酿成大祸。因此，“五胡乱华”的责任不能让窦宪和曹操来负。
    据我看来，曹操受到歪曲的另一原因，和秦始皇一样，是政权的延续不太长。秦是二世就亡了，仅仅十几年。魏的统治也不久。魏文帝曹丕在位仅七年，只活了四十岁。魏明帝曹睿在位仅十四年，只活了三十六岁。偶然碰着了这两位短命皇帝，所以给了司马氏以夺取政权的机会。曹丕和曹睿都是比较可取的人物，如果他们活得长一点，在位得长一点，曹魏的统治更长得一点，我看历史上对于曹氏祖孙父子的评价是会有所不同的。
    总之，我们今天要从新的观点来追求历史的真实性，替曹操翻案；而且还须得替一切受了委曲的历史人物，如殷纣王，如秦始皇，翻案。只有在人民做了主人的今天才有可能。人民是正直的，只要我们把真正的历史真实性阐明了，人民决不会把有功于民族发展和文化发展的历史人物，长远地错当成反面教员。因此，我们乐于承担这个任务：替曹操翻案。
