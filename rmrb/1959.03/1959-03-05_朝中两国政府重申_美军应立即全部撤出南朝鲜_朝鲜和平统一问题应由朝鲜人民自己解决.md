Xinhua News Agency, March 4th—The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today handed a note to the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires and requested the British government to forward it to the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations forces. This note is a reply from the Chinese government, in its own name and on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the note of December 4, 1958, from the British government representing the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations forces. The full text of the note is as follows:

To the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires:

    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China respectfully requests the Office of the Chargé d'Affaires to notify the British government of the following matters and, through the British government, forward them to the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations forces.
    The Chinese government, in its own name and on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, considers it necessary to make the following statement in response to the British government's Note No. 129 of December 4, 1958, representing the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations forces.
    The Chinese and North Korean governments believe that the British Note No. 129 does not show the slightest sincerity on the part of the governments of the countries of the United Nations forces to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The note failed to provide any satisfactory answer to the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, as raised in previous notes and statements by the Chinese and North Korean governments, but instead adopted an evasive attitude. The governments of the countries of the United Nations forces have not taken any measures to withdraw their troops from Korea. It is particularly important to point out that the United States has repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, transporting large quantities of new weapons, including atomic weapons, into South Korea, and conducting military exercises near the Military Demarcation Line, exacerbating tensions in Korea. Therefore, the governments of the countries of the United Nations forces, especially the United States government, must be held responsible for the failure to achieve a swift and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and bear all the consequences of the deterioration of the situation in Korea and all the consequences arising therefrom.
    It is even more absurd to forward the so-called United Nations resolution passed under the manipulation of the United States in the reply.
    As is well known, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations has been placed in the position of one of the belligerent parties in Korea, and it has long lost its qualification and moral strength to deal with the Korean issue fairly and reasonably. Therefore, all resolutions passed by the United Nations concerning the Korean issue are one-sided and invalid. Any attempt to impose the will of one party on the other can only be interpreted as deliberately obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea and creating excuses for the long-term occupation of South Korea by American troops.
    The Chinese and North Korean governments believe that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea, and the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves through consultations between North and South Korea without foreign interference; the desire of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their homeland must be fulfilled; relevant countries should undertake the obligation to guarantee the peace of Korea and not interfere in the internal affairs of Korea. The Chinese and North Korean governments have made unremitting efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, and the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea in October 1958. The governments of the countries of the United Nations forces should respect the will of all Korean people to reunify their homeland and make corresponding efforts to withdraw all their troops from South Korea immediately, otherwise, they cannot escape the serious responsibility of obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea.

### 朝中两国政府重申  美军应立即全部撤出南朝鲜  朝鲜和平统一问题应由朝鲜人民自己解决

    朝中两国政府重申
    美军应立即全部撤出南朝鲜
    朝鲜和平统一问题应由朝鲜人民自己解决
    新华社4日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天交给英国代办处照会一份，并且要求英国政府转达参加联合国军方面各国政府。这份照会是中国政府以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，对英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府1958年12月4日来照所作的答复。照会全文如下：英国代办处：
    中华人民共和国外交部谨请代办处将下列事项通知英国政府，并且通过英国政府转达联合国军方面各国政府。
    中国政府以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，认为必须对1958年12月4日英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府的来照作如下的声明。
    朝中两国政府认为从英国第一二九号照会中看不出联合国军的各国政府有谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的丝毫诚意。该照会对于朝中两国政府历次照会和声明中提出的从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队问题没有作出任何令人满意的答复，而是采取了回避的态度。联合国军方面各国政府没有采取任何措施从朝鲜撤出它们的军队。特别需要指出的是美国一再违反朝鲜停战协定，把原子武器等大批新式武器运入南朝鲜，并且在军事分界线附近举行军事演习，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势。因此，联合国军方面各国政府特别是美国政府必须对朝鲜问题的不能迅速和平解决负责，并承担朝鲜局势的恶化和由此引起的一切后果。
    来照把美国操纵下通过的所谓联合国决议转来，更是荒谬之至。
    如众所周知，在美国操纵下，联合国被置于朝鲜交战一方的地位，它早已失去了公平合理地处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。因而联合国所通过一切有关朝鲜问题的决议都是片面的和无效的。一切企图以一方的意志强加于另一方的做法只能被解释为蓄意阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并且为美国军队长期占领南朝鲜制造借口。
    朝中两国政府认为，一切外国军队必须从朝鲜撤出，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己在没有外力干涉的情况下，通过南北朝鲜的协商求得解决；朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的愿望必须得到满足；有关国家应该承担义务保证朝鲜的和平和不干涉朝鲜的内政。朝中两国政府为实现朝鲜和平统一作出了不懈的努力，中国人民志愿军已经于1958年10月全部撤离朝鲜。联合国军方面各国政府应当尊重全体朝鲜人民统一祖国的意志，作出相应的努力，把它们的军队立即全部从南朝鲜撤出去，否则它们就不能逃避它们阻挠朝鲜和平统一的严重责任。
