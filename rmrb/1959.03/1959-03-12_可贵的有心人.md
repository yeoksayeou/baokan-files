Admirable People with Heart
Qin Li

If someone asks: What is the business of an old bookstore? I'm afraid everyone would laugh at their naivety. Since it's called an old bookstore, can its business go beyond the circle of "buying and selling"? Buying is to serve those who sell books; selling is to serve readers. That's all there is to it. But there are two bookstores that have combined their business with very meaningful work.

The Shanghai Ancient Books Bookstore and the Shanghai Old Bookstore successively sent out a group of experienced staff members to collect revolutionary historical materials throughout the country at the end of last year. The effect was very good. They collected many valuable revolutionary books, periodicals, and revolutionary historical materials, including two kinds of books and periodicals related to Chairman Mao's early revolutionary activities - the "Tian Wen" weekly and "A History of the Hunan Autonomy Movement." In the twenty-third issue of the "Tian Wen" weekly, there is an article written by Chairman Mao entitled "The Self-Determination of the Hunan People." They also collected the Chongqing Xinhua Daily dated January 18, 1941. This newspaper contains Comrade Zhou Enlai's elegy "Mourning Those Who Died for the Country in Southern Anhui" and the poem "An Unprecedented Injustice, the Incident in Southern Anhui; Fratricidal Strife, Why the Urgent Mutual Torment!" This newspaper was very difficult to find in the past. The reason why their collection was so effective is that they are people with heart, and they are doing the collection work purposefully, not just general "buying and selling," waiting for customers to come to their door.

Collecting revolutionary books and periodicals is an arduous task. During the Kuomintang rule, reading revolutionary books and periodicals was against the "law" and was considered a "crime." Needless to say, preserving revolutionary books and periodicals was even worse. The reason why some revolutionary books and periodicals could be preserved was thanks to some people with heart at that time. They preserved them at the risk of being beheaded and imprisoned. These people with heart are worthy of our admiration. However, more revolutionary books and periodicals and revolutionary historical materials have been lost for various reasons. This requires our current people with heart to discover and collect them. The comrades of these two bookstores are doing just that.

If all regions and relevant departments pay attention to this issue and become people with heart, I think the work of collecting revolutionary documents will be done better and the achievements will be even greater.

    可贵的有心人
    秦犁
    如果有人问：旧书店的业务是什么？恐怕大家都会笑他幼稚。既然叫旧书店，它的业务还跳得出“买进，卖出”这个圈子？买进，为售书者服务；卖出，为读者服务。如此而已。但是有这么两家书店，却结合自己的业务，做了很有意义的工作。
    上海古籍书店和上海旧书店，去年年底曾陆续派出一批较有经验的工作人员，到全国各地去收购革命史料，效果很好，收购到不少珍贵的革命书刊和革命史料，其中有与毛主席初期革命活动有关的两种书刊——“天问”周刊和“湖南自治运动史”。在“天问”周刊第二十三号上有毛主席写的“湖南人民的自决”一文。他们还搜集到1941年1月18日的重庆新华日报。这张报纸上有周恩来同志“为江南死国难者志哀”和“千古奇冤，江南一叶；同室操戈，相煎何急！”的题诗。这张报纸过去很难找到。他们搜集效果之所以好，就在于他们是有心人，是有目的地去做搜集工作的，不是一般的“买进，卖出”，等客上门。
    搜集革命书刊是一件艰巨的工作。在国民党统治时代，读革命书刊是犯“法”的，是要论“罪”的，保存革命书刊那就更不用说。有的革命书刊之所以能保存下来，就是靠了当时的一些有心人，他们保存它，是冒了杀头坐监的危险的。这种有心人值得我们钦敬。但是更多的革命书刊和革命史料，却因种种原因散失了，这就需要我们现在的有心人去发现它，搜集它。这两家书店的同志，正是做了这样的有心人。
    假如各个地区，各个有关部门，都注意这个问题，都来做有心人，我想，搜集革命文献的工作会做得更好，成绩将会更大。
