Jiangxi's 4.8 Million-Strong Army Fights in the Rice Fields Guangdong Launches Mass Inspection to Welcome Rice Transplanting

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 19th report) Currently, a spring plowing production movement of "striving for one season of early rice to surpass a whole year" is vigorously unfolding across Jiangxi Province. In the early spring of the Gan-nan area, soaking and sowing have generally begun; the first batch of seedlings is growing lush and strong, and people are strengthening their cultivation and management. On the vast Gan-zhong Plain, millions of laborers are busy accumulating fertilizer, plowing fields, and repairing water conservancy facilities. In the recently rainy Jiujiang area, a spring plowing production movement centered on accumulating and producing fertilizer and sowing seeds is in full swing, with thousands upon thousands of people fighting in the rain. The people of the entire province have loudly proposed: Grasp early rice firmly, strive for one season to surpass a whole year, and seize the first hurdle for winning the overall victory for the year.

In order to guarantee the realization of a bumper early rice harvest, all localities are grasping measures firmly and using measures to ensure high yields. First, political and ideological work has been strengthened, and large-scale propaganda for spring plowing production has been carried out. All localities have summarized the achievements and experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward, adopted various methods, and widely publicized the great significance of striving for a bumper early rice harvest this year, thereby further boosting the enthusiasm of the masses. Second, taking the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" as the guiding principle, all localities have comprehensively conducted a major inspection of preparatory work, and promptly taken measures to remedy any problems discovered. Based on the inspection, the province has currently organized three million laborers to fiercely attack the fertilizer bottleneck, requiring each mu of early rice to be fertilized with 600 dan of farm manure and 400 to 500 jin of soil fertilizer, and to effectively carry out deep plowing, close planting, and tool reform. Third, large-scale high-yield demonstration fields are being vigorously developed. Currently, the planned large-scale high-yield demonstration fields in various localities have reached more than 5 million mu, which is the key to realizing a bumper early rice harvest this year. Therefore, in addition to strengthening measures for high-yield demonstration fields, all localities have generally implemented the "Four Aspects Reaching Every Field" system (targets, measures, management methods, division of labor) to ensure high yields in every field and a bumper harvest on every mu. Fourth, in order to first meet the needs of agricultural production for labor, all localities have transferred a large number of laborers from community-run industries, sideline occupations, service industries, and other fields to strengthen the agricultural front, based on the principle of rational arrangement and ensuring key areas. Currently, the labor force on the agricultural front in the province has reached 4.8 million people, accounting for more than 80% of the total rural labor force in the province. Fifth, competitions are being organized extensively and in depth. Currently, heated competitions have been launched among more than 80 counties across the province and among the 1,100-plus people's communes. Sixth, party organizations at all levels are delegating cadres to strengthen specific leadership over agricultural production.

Currently, the people of the province are working hard with full confidence to achieve a bumper early rice harvest this year. Fuzhou Prefecture, striving to achieve a 2,000-jin-per-mu specialized zone for the entire year, has universally launched visit-and-compare and red-flag competition movements between counties and counties, communes and communes, teams and teams, and members and members. In order to speed up the accumulation and delivery of fertilizer, Wenzhen People's Commune in Linchuan County launched a "Four Comparisons" and "Three Competitions" competition in the entire commune, comparing attendance, progress, quality, and skills, and competing in determination, energy, and momentum. After eight days of hard work by more than 6,000 commune members, more than 4 million dan of fertilizer have been delivered to the fields.

Under the hard work of the province's 4.8 million-strong spring plowing production army, the province's spring plowing production has achieved great results. According to statistics as of March 13, the province had accumulated 13.3 billion dan of various fertilizers, an increase of 6.7 billion dan over the same period last year. Calculated based on the province's 24 million mu of early rice sown area, each mu already has 555 dan of fertilizer and 250 jin of soil fertilizer. Water conservancy projects have completed more than 365 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, and more than 93,000 large and small projects have been completed. The province's first batch of early rice sowing work has been completed, and some areas have begun the second batch of sowing. The Gan-nan Administrative Region, with its earlier season, has completed 60% of its early rice sowing task.

(Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th report) Guangdong Province has recently launched a mass spring plowing inspection to welcome the upcoming busy season of early rice transplanting.

Recently, all localities in Guangdong Province, with counties, communes, or production management areas as units, have conducted field inspections of current spring plowing work item by item, promoting early rice preparation and cultivation. After the major inspections in the four special zones of Foshan, Shantou, Jiangmen, and Shaoguan, areas that had partially failed to implement spring plowing and cultivation measures and plans organized forces to rush to deliver and apply fertilizer, plow and harrow fields, and sow and cultivate seedlings, quickly catching up with advanced areas according to plan requirements. In the major inspections in many counties in Jiangmen, Shantou, Foshan, and other special zones, the question of whether or not enough seedlings were prepared, whether or not fertilizers were delivered to the fields, and whether or not field management could keep up, overcame the thinking of some cadres and commune members who thought "the season is still early, take your time to start," and implemented the method of simultaneously advancing seedling cultivation, field management, and fertilizer delivery to the fields; some communes also organized shock teams for remote fields and implemented contract systems. Now, most of the more than 13 million mu of early rice in these three special zones have been plowed and re-harrowed according to the measures plan, with more than 1,200 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, and seedlings have been cultivated and transplanting has begun. On Hainan Island, where transplanting started earliest, the transplanting progress has been accelerated through major inspections of transplanting and field management, and an average of about 500,000 seedlings have been densely planted per mu of the more than 900,000 mu of fields that have been transplanted.

In the upcoming busy season of early rice transplanting in Guangdong Province, in order to strive for a basic farmland yield of 1,800 jin per mu, it is required to transplant about 500,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu. This is a key measure to strive for high yields. After identifying the reasons why some seedlings were destroyed by cold waves and some original sowing was insufficient during the major inspection, all localities immediately organized forces to step up topdressing in seedling fields, frequently drain and shallow irrigate, rescue damaged seedlings, and fix specific personnel for management, while also massively replanting. After resisting the cold and protecting seedlings during the cold wave, Fanshun County in Foshan Prefecture organized more than 15,000 cadres and commune members to conduct a comprehensive inspection of seedling fields, identify them plot by plot, and formulate measures through "field diagnosis" and "prescribing the right medicine," turning more than 18,000 mu of frozen seedlings green again within a few days.

The first characteristic of this spring plowing inspection in Guangdong Province is its large scale, with 1.5 million people participating in Shaoguan Prefecture alone; another characteristic is the universal practice of inspecting, comparing, determining measures, and organizing actions simultaneously, so that inspection and improvement work are closely integrated.

Now, combined with the major spring plowing inspection, all localities in Guangdong Province are organizing a comprehensive high-yield competition movement between counties and counties, communes and communes, management areas and management areas, and production teams and production teams. On the basis of the major inspection, Foshan, Jiangmen, Shantou, and other special zones have implemented hooked-up competitions of soldiers against soldiers and generals against generals, and in turn, have mutually established a system of regular inspections and comparisons to ensure that various yield-increasing measures are effectively implemented to the end.

    过好早稻丰收第一关
    江西四百八十万大军奋战秧田  广东开展群众性检查迎接插秧
    本报南昌19日电　目前，一个“力争早稻一季赛一年”的春耕生产运动，正风起云涌地在江西省各地展开。早春的赣南地区，普遍开始了浸种和播种；第一批秧苗长得青葱茁壮，人们正在加强培育管理。广阔的赣中平原上，几百万劳动大军正忙着积肥、犁田、修水利。近来多雨的九江地区，以积肥造肥和播种为中心的春耕生产运动热火朝天，成千上万的人冒雨奋战。全省人民响亮地提出：狠狠抓早稻，力争一季赛一年，夺取全年胜利的第一关。
    为了保证实现早稻大丰收，各地都在狠狠抓措施，用措施来保高产。第一，加强了政治思想工作，大张旗鼓地开展了春耕生产大宣传。各地都通过总结去年大跃进的成绩和经验，采取各种办法，广泛宣传了争取今年早稻大丰收的重大意义，从而更加鼓足了群众的干劲。第二，以贯彻“八字宪法”为纲，各地全面地进行了备耕工作大检查，发现问题及时采取措施进行补救。根据检查的情况，目前全省组织了三百万劳动力猛攻肥料关，要求每亩早稻施农家肥六百担，土化肥四百到五百斤，并切实做好深耕、密植和工具改革等工作。第三，大搞大面积高额丰产田。目前各地计划搞的大面积高额丰产田已达五百多万亩，这是实现今年早稻大丰收的关键。因此，各地除了加强高额丰产田的措施外，普遍实行了“四到丘”（指标、措施、管理方法、分工）的制度，以保证丘丘高产，亩亩丰收。第四，为了首先满足农业生产对劳动力的需要，各地根据合理安排、保证重点的原则，从社办工业、副业、服务行业等各方面抽调出大批劳动力加强农业战线。目前全省农业战线上的劳动力已达四百八十万人，占全省农村总劳动力的80％以上。第五，广泛深入地组织竞赛。目前全省八十多个县和全省一千一百多个人民公社之间，都已掀起了热烈的竞赛。第六，各级党组织层层下放干部，加强了对农业生产的具体领导。
    目前，全省人民正在满怀信心地为实现今年早稻大丰收而紧张的劳动着。力争全年实现两千斤专区的抚州专区，各县普遍开展了县与县、公社与公社、队与队、社员与社员之间的参观评比和红旗竞赛运动。临川县温圳人民公社为了加快积肥送肥的速度，在全社开展了比出勤、比进度、比质量、比技巧和赛决心、赛干劲、赛声势的“四比”“三赛”竞赛。全社六千多个社员经过八天苦战，四百多万担肥料已全部送到了田。
    在全省四百八十万春耕生产大军的奋战下，全省春耕生产已获得很大成绩。到3月13日统计，全省已积各种肥料一百三十三亿担，比去年同期间增加六十七亿担，按全省二千四百万亩早稻播种面积计算，每亩已有肥料五百五十五担，土化肥二百五十斤。水利已完成三亿六千五百多万土石方，已完工的大小工程达九万三千多座。全省第一批早稻播种工作已经全部结束，部分地区并已开始了第二批播种。季节较早的赣南行政区，已完成早稻播种任务的60％。

    本报广州19日电　广东省最近展开了群众性的春耕大检查，以迎接即将到来的早稻插秧大忙。
    最近，广东省各地都以县、公社或生产管理区为单位，就当前春耕工作逐项进行了田间大检查，推动了早稻备耕和开耕。佛山、汕头、江门、韶关四个专区经过大检查后，部分贯彻春耕、开耕措施计划不力的地区，都组织了力量，按照计划要求，突击送肥、施肥、犁田、耙田、播秧、育秧，很快赶上了先进地区。江门、汕头、佛山等专区许多县，在大检查中，还通过查秧苗是否准备足，查肥料是否运到田，查办田是否赶得上，克服了一部分干部、社员认为“季节还早，慢慢动手”的思想，实行了育秧、办田、送肥三路齐头并进到田的办法；有些公社还给远田组织了突击队，实行包干。现在，这三个专区的一千三百多万亩早稻，大部分已按措施计划翻犁复耙，每亩施下一千二百担以上的基肥，并且培育了秧苗，开始插秧。插秧最早的海南岛，经过插秧和田间管理大检查，插秧进度更快了，已插下的九十多万亩田平均每亩密植秧苗在五十万条左右。
    广东省即将开始的早稻插秧大忙中，为力争基本农田亩产一千八百斤，要求每亩插五十万到八十万条苗左右。这是力争高产的关键性措施。大检查中，找出了部分秧苗被寒潮摧残和部分原来播种不足的原因之后，各地立即组织力量加紧秧田追肥，勤排浅灌，抢救坏秧苗，并固定专人管理，同时大量补植。佛山专区番顺县在寒潮中经过抗寒保苗后，又组织了一万五千多干部、社员全面进行秧田大检查，逐丘鉴定，通过“田头会诊”、
  “对症下药”订措施，几天内使一万八千多亩被冻坏的秧苗回青转绿。
    广东省此次春耕大检查的第一个特点是规模大，只韶关专区就有一百五十万人参加；另一个特点是普遍地实行边检查，边评比，边定措施，边组织行动，使检查和改进工作紧密结合起来。
    现在，广东省各地结合春耕大检查，正在组织起一个县与县、社与社、管理区与管理区和生产队与生产队之间的全面高产大竞赛运动。佛山、江门、汕头等专区都在大检查的基础上，实行兵对兵、将对将的挂钩竞赛，反过来又互相订立了定期检查评比的制度，保证各项增产措施切实贯彻到底。（附图片）
