Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 2nd: Reporter Qin Yuzhen reports: Anhui Province's vast rural science and technology network is now actively carrying out scientific research and popularizing science, focusing on the spring production season and vigorously serving production.

There are more than 77,000 rural science and technology organizations in Anhui Province, with more than one million participants, including engineers, technicians, commune and team cadres, experienced farmers, and students in rural areas engaged in production. Under the guidance of county science research institutes and technology extension stations, they closely integrate with production and actively carry out diverse scientific research and science popularization work, adopting the method of "study what you do, solve whatever problems arise in production," experimenting, researching, and promoting simultaneously to serve production. Currently, they are focusing on field management of summer harvest crops, cultivating high-yield demonstration plots, vigorously carrying out tool reforms, mass-producing native chemical fertilizers and pesticides, establishing plant protection teams and pest and disease intelligence teams, actively inspecting and preparing spring sowing seeds, and conducting germination tests. In order to help wheat yields exceed 1,000 jin per mu in the Fuyang Special Zone, various science and technology organizations actively cooperate with the communes to conduct a general survey of wheat fields, study methods for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, prepare necessary medicines, and establish more than 2,500 native chemical fertilizer and pesticide plants, producing large quantities of lime and sulfur mixture, plant ash, etc., and making more than 30 kinds of native chemical fertilizers, with a current production of 5.5 million dan. In Huaibei, a large number of rice planting technicians are being trained for the conversion to rice cultivation. Fuyang has already trained 258 rice conversion teachers, and before transplanting, the entire special zone will train 1.5 million to 2 million rice conversion technicians. Lai'an County has established 135 key research groups for wheat and rice. The county's science and technology organizations have cultivated 200,000 mu of high-yield fields, and many key groups have established field archives, recording field management and carrying out research work. The county is also promoting and rushing to manufacture more than 6,000 rice transplanters, so that the entire county uses rice transplanters for planting.

In carrying out scientific research work, various places are vigorously carrying out technological revolution, implementing a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and new creations and inventions are constantly emerging, playing a significant role in production. Mao Qichang, a native expert in Taihe County, lengthened the water tank of his created topdressing cart, increasing efficiency from 20 mu per day to 60 mu. Yang Shouyi, a native expert in Funan County, has successfully tested a four-bucket waterwheel. The water pumping capacity of this waterwheel is equivalent to a 30-horsepower water pump. The Lai'an County Scientific Experiment Station used charcoal to burn phosphate rock to make calcium superphosphate, creating conditions for large-scale phosphate fertilizer production. The pest and disease key research group in Tuncang Township has researched and developed more than 10 kinds of native pesticides to prevent and control wheat stem rust, and some scientific research groups have adopted the method of simultaneous experimentation, research, and popularization, so that more than 30 methods of manufacturing chemical fertilizers have been promoted throughout the county. Zhangshan, Leiguan, Shiguang and other communes in this county, using political, cultural and technical schools as bases, gathered more than 400 native experts and young and middle-aged commune members to conduct experiments in the fields while working. Now, they are conducting research on seedling transplantation and the rational application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers.

In order to widely impart new scientific and technological knowledge and promote universal science learning and the application of science in production, various places have carried out science popularization work. All localities have summarized the experience of high-yield fields last year, compiled them into booklets, and explained them before and after various meetings and in the fields. In January this year, Lai'an County convened a meeting of more than 2,000 district, township, and commune cadres to conduct a major inspection and comparison of scientific work, and each township held a mobilization meeting for science popularization work, formulating a scientific work plan for 1959. The county has summarized more than 70 experiences in manufacturing native chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preventing and controlling wheat diseases and insect pests, low-temperature seedling cultivation, close planting, seed selection, and topdressing, and organized more than 1,700 mobile propaganda stations to carry out propaganda work. After Liu, an old man from the Maoqiao Production Brigade, understood how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer was needed for wheat yields per mu, he mobilized his production team to make human urine fertilizer, producing more than 200 dan in one day.

Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province attach great importance to scientific research and popularization work. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, personally oversees scientific work. The leaders of many scientific and technological institutions are personally led by party and government leaders at all levels, arranging how to make scientific research work serve production. Therefore, a wave of enthusiasm for researching science and technology has emerged in the spring production throughout the province. (Attached pictures)

    干什么研究什么　有什么问题解决什么问题
    安徽农村科学网为生产服务
    本报合肥2日电　记者秦聿震报道：安徽省庞大的农村科学技术网，现正围绕着春季大生产积极开展科学研究和科学普及工作，大力为生产服务。
    安徽全省有七万七千多个农村科学技术机构，共有一百多万人参加，其中有工程师、技术员，社、队干部、老农和在乡参加生产的学生。他们在县科学研究所和技术推广站的指导下，紧密结合生产，积极开展多种多样的科学研究和科学普及工作，采取干什么研究什么，生产中存在什么问题就解决什么问题的方法，边试验，边研究，边推广，为生产服务。现在，他们正大抓夏收作物的田间管理，培养高额丰产田，大搞工具改革，大制土化
  肥和土农药，建立植物保护小组、病虫害情报小组，积极检查和准备春播种子，并作发芽试验。阜阳专区为了使小麦亩产过千斤关，各科学技术组织积极配合公社，对麦田进行大普查，研究病虫害的防治方法和必要的药物准备工作，并建立了二千五百多个土化肥和土农药厂，大量生产石灰和硫磺合剂、草木灰等，并制成三十多种土化肥，现已生产出五十五万多担。淮北为了进行改种水稻工作，大量培养种稻技术人员。阜阳已培训了二百五十八名稻改老师，插秧前，全专区要训练出一百五十万至二百万稻改技术员。来安县已建成小麦、水稻重点研究组一百三十五个。全县科学技术组织培养了二十万亩高额丰产田，有不少重点小组建立了田头档案，进行田间管理记载，开展研究工作。这个县还正在推广和赶制插秧机六千多部，使全县都用插秧机栽秧。
    在开展科学研究工作中，各地大闹技术革命，实行土洋结合，新的创造发明不断涌现，对生产起了很大作用。太和县土专家毛其昌，把他创造的追肥车的水槽加长，效率由原来每天浇二十亩提高到六十亩。阜南县土专家杨守义创造的四桶水车已试验成功。这种水车的抽水量相等于三十马力的抽水机。来安县科学试验室用木炭烧磷矿石，制成了醋酸过磷酸钙，为大搞磷肥创造了条件。该县屯仓乡病虫害重点研究小组，已研究出防治小麦秆锈病的土农药十多种，有些科学研究小组采用边试验，边研究，边普及的办法，使三十多种制造化肥的办法在全县推广。这个县的张山、雷官、施官等公社以政治文化技术学校为基地，集中土专家、青壮年社员四百多人，边干边研究，大搞试验田。现在，他们正在进行移苗和氮、磷、钾肥合理施用的研究。
    为了广泛传授新的科学技术，推动全民学科学，生产用科学，各地开展了科学宣传工作。各地都总结了去年高额丰产田的经验，编印成小册子，在各种会议前后，在田头地边进行讲解。来安县在今年1月召开了两千多人的区、乡、社干部大会，开展科学工作大检查大评比，各乡又开了科普工作誓师大会，制订1959年的科学工作规划。该县已总结出制造土化肥、土农药、防治小麦病虫害、低温育苗、密植、选种、追肥等的经验七十多种，组织一千七百多个流动宣传站开展宣传工作，毛桥生产大队的刘老大爷，懂得小麦亩产需要多少氮、磷、钾肥后，即动员本生产队制造人尿肥，一天就造了二百多担。
    安徽省各级党委对科学研究和普及工作十分重视。安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志亲自抓科学工作，许多科学技术机构的领导人，都是由各级党政负责人亲自领导，安排如何使科学研究工作为生产服务。因此，全省春季生产中出现了研究科学技术的热潮。（附图片）
