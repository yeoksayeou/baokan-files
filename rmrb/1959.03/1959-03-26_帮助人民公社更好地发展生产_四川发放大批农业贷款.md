To Help People's Communes Better Develop Production
Sichuan Issues Large Agricultural Loans
Chengdu, March 25th (This newspaper dispatch) – Sichuan Province is issuing a large number of agricultural loans to support people's communes in developing production. Currently, spring plowing loans are being accelerated for distribution across various regions. As of early March, people's communes throughout the province had already received over 40 million yuan in loans. According to the plan, the total amount of agricultural loans issued throughout the province during the first half of this year will reach approximately 300 million yuan through the People's Bank of China and credit cooperatives.

People's communes throughout Sichuan Province need an unprecedented increase in funds as they strive for rapid development in industry and agriculture this year and a comprehensive great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. After implementing the system of unified leadership and hierarchical management, this situation has become even more prominent, and many communes and production teams urgently need appropriate assistance from the state. To this end, Sichuan has made the issuance of agricultural loans this year an important measure to help people's communes better organize production. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued relevant instructions as early as last December and made timely arrangements. Many places began issuing loans from January.

Based on the new situation after the people's communes were established, Sichuan has paid special attention to taking care of key needs while rationally considering general needs during the issuance of loans this year. The loans issued in Neijiang, Wenjiang, Nanchong, and other regions are mostly used to support communes in purchasing or self-manufacturing fertilizers, oxen, and agricultural machinery and pesticides, based on actual production needs, and appropriate arrangements have also been made in commune-run industries and basic construction. In terms of recipients, all regions first help the communes or production teams with the most urgent needs.

In order to ensure that loans are issued in a timely and accurate manner, counties such as Leshan, Fushun, and Longchang have sent a large number of cadres to understand the needs of the communes and production, and to help formulate production funding plans and loan plans. They meticulously calculated to ensure that the loans played their full role, while also helping communes and production teams tap potential and expand sources of funds in many ways. When the Wanxian People's Bank helped five communes in the Longju District plan loans, it assisted the communes in self-manufacturing local fertilizers and local pesticides, saving a large amount of funds, in accordance with the spirit of relying as little as possible on the state if they could solve the problems themselves.

Loans have powerfully supported the development of production in people's communes. People's communes in various parts of the sugarcane-rich Neijiang region have purchased more than 500 tons of chemical fertilizer after receiving loans. People's communes in Nanchong County recently borrowed a total of more than 900,000 yuan, bought more than 600 head of cattle, and timely invested them in spring plowing production. Among the eight management districts of the Xianfeng People's Commune in Ziyang County, three management areas originally had poor economic conditions and relatively backward production. After receiving loans, they bought more than 80 cattle and other means of production, and set up a number of fertilizer factories, and production quickly improved greatly.

    帮助人民公社更好地发展生产
    四川发放大批农业贷款
    本报成都25日电　四川省发放大批农业贷款支援人民公社发展生产。目前，各地春耕贷款正加速发出。到3月上旬，全省人民公社已领贷款四千多万元。按照计划，今年上半年通过人民银行和信用社，全省发放农贷总数将达三亿元左右。
    四川省各地人民公社在力争今年工农业飞速发展和农林牧副渔全面大跃进中，需要资金比往年空前增加。在实行统一领导分级管理的制度后，这种形势更加突出，许多公社和生产队都迫切需要国家的适当帮助。为此，四川今年把发放农贷作为帮助人民公社更好地组织生产的一项重要措施。中共四川省委早在去年12月就发出了有关指示，及时进行了布置。从1月份起，许多地方就开始发放贷款。
    根据人民公社化后的新形势，今年四川各地在发放贷款中特别注意了照顾重点需要，同时合理兼顾一般。内江、温江、南充等专区发放的贷款，大都根据生产实际需要，主要用于支援公社购买或自制肥料、耕牛、农药械等方面，同时在社办工业、基本建设方面也都做了适当安排。在发放对象上，各地都首先帮助需要最迫切的公社或生产队。
    为了使贷款发放及时而准确，乐山、富顺、隆昌等县都派出了大批干部了解公社和生产的需要，帮助制定生产资金规划和贷款计划。他们精打细算，使贷款充分发挥作用，同时多方面帮助公社和生产队挖掘潜力，扩大资金来源。万县人民银行在帮助龙驹区五个公社计划贷款时，按照自己能解决的尽量不依靠国家的精神，协助公社自制土化肥、土农药，节省了很大一笔资金。
    通过贷款有力地支援了人民公社发展生产。盛产甘蔗的内江专区各地人民公社，在得到贷款后已买回五百多吨化学肥料。南充县各地人民公社最近共贷到九十多万元，买回六百多头耕牛，及时地投入了春耕生产。资阳县先锋人民公社的八个管理区中，有三个管区原来经济条件较差，生产也比较落后，经过贷款后，他们买了八十多头牛和其它生产资料，举办了一批肥料厂，生产上很快就大有起色。
