Strive to Manufacture Heavy, Precision Mechanical Equipment in the Short Term
Jilin City Ushers in a New Upsurge in Vigorously Developing the Machinery Industry

(Reported by our newspaper) In order to thoroughly change the situation of "not being able to do big, heavy, and precise work, and not having enough small, light, and rough work," the employees of various machinery factories in Jilin City are working hard to strive to basically undertake the task of manufacturing large, heavy, and precision mechanical equipment in a short period of time. It is determined that more than 500 large, medium, and small machine tools will be manufactured this year to equip themselves, increase mechanical manufacturing capacity, and accelerate the development speed of the machinery industry.

More than a month ago, Jilin City's machinery industry had already manufactured more than 180 various machine tools by combining indigenous and foreign methods. After these machine tools were put into production, the production capacity has been increased by more than double compared to the original equipment, greatly changing the production outlook of the city's machinery industry. However, the newly added 100-plus machine tools still cannot adapt to the new situation of a greater leap forward. According to the production situation of several larger machinery factories, this year's output value plan will increase more than four times compared to last year. The variety of products has also increased. This year, it is required to manufacture large, heavy, and precise equipment, such as Red Flag No. 2 coking equipment, cement production equipment, large brick presses, air compressors, etc., some of which weigh up to 540 tons per set.

After studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the employees of various machinery factories in Jilin City summarized the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year and formulated this year's leap forward plan. When discussing and arranging this year's plan, various machinery factories proposed to continue implementing the policy of walking on two legs, manufacturing whatever mechanical equipment is needed according to production needs, and arming themselves. According to statistics from factories such as the First Machinery Factory, the Third Machinery Factory, the Lianda Machinery Factory, and the New Enterprise Company, more than 500 new machine tools will be manufactured this year, of which more than 200 will be manufactured in the first quarter.

At present, the employees of various machinery factories are actively engaged in new battles and have formed a new upsurge in vigorously developing mechanical equipment. The First Machinery Factory plans to manufacture 50 relatively precise lathes and planers in the first quarter, and strive to arm the newly built 2,000-square-meter factory building with its own manufactured mechanical equipment. The Third Machinery Factory is carrying out a competition to complete the task of manufacturing 60 lathes in a very short time. In order to manufacture more and better large and medium-sized mixers, hoists and other equipment urgently needed by the construction enterprise, the Machinery Factory of the Municipal Construction Company adopted the method of designing, manufacturing, and installing simultaneously to accelerate the armament of itself. Some machinery factories are starting to manufacture large-scale machinery that was not available in the past but is now urgently needed, such as 1,000-ton hydraulic presses, herringbone gear milling machines, floor-type boring machines, floor-type lathes, and vertical lathes.

### 争取在短期内能够制造重型、精密的机械设备  吉林市掀起大搞机械工业的新高潮

    争取在短期内能够制造重型、精密的机械设备
    吉林市掀起大搞机械工业的新高潮
    本报讯　吉林市机械工业为了彻底改变“大活重活精活干不了，小活轻活粗活不够干”的局面，各机械厂职工正在努力争取在短时间内，基本上能够担负起制造大型、重型、精密机械设备的任务。确定今年要制造五百余台大中小型机床装备自己，增加机械制造能力，加快机械工业发展速度。
    吉林市机械工业在一个多月前，已经制造出一百八十多台土洋结合的各种机床。这批机床投入生产以后，已经比原有设备的生产能力提高一倍以上，大大改变了全市机械工业生产面貌。但是，新增加这一百多台机床，仍然不能适应更大跃进的新形势。据几个较大机械厂的生产情况来看，今年的产值计划比去年增加四倍以上。生产的品种也增多了。今年要求制造大型、重型、精密的设备，如红旗二号炼焦设备、水泥生产设备、大型压砖机、空气压缩机等，其中有些设备每套的重量达五百四十吨。
    吉林市各机械工厂职工从学习了党的八届六中全会决议以后，总结了去年大跃进的经验，制订了今年的跃进计划。各机械厂在讨论和安排今年计划时提出要继续贯彻两条腿走路的方针，根据生产需要，缺什么机械设备就造什么机械设备，把自己武装起来。据第一机械厂、第三机械厂、联大机械厂、新生企业公司等厂的统计，今年要制造五百多台新机床，其中第一季度要制出二百多台。
    目前各机械厂职工正在积极投入新的战斗，并已形成大搞机械设备的新高潮。第一机械厂，计划在第一季度要制造五十台比较精密的车床和刨床，并争取把新建的两千平方公尺的厂房，用自己制造的机械设备武装起来。第三机械厂正为在很短时间内就完成制造六十台车床的任务开展了竞赛。市建筑公司机械厂，为了制造出更多更好的、建筑企业急需的大中型搅拌机、卷扬机等设备，采取了边设计、边制造、边安装的办法，加快武装自己。有的机械厂正在开始制造过去没有而现在又急需的、大型的机械，如一千吨水压机、人字齿轮铣、落地镗床、落地车床和立式车床等等。
