Xinhua News Agency, March 25th—The representatives attending the Ministry of Commerce's National Storage and Transportation Work Conference have proposed eight initiatives to storage and transportation workers in the national commercial system, as common goals to strive for, to launch a red banner movement in storage and transportation work. These eight initiatives are:

	1.	Strengthen planned management of transportation work. Faced with the extremely heavy transportation tasks in 1959, we resolutely adhere to the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and "making way, assisting, squeezing," actively coordinate with railway and transportation departments to properly arrange commodity transportation plans, first ensuring the transportation of national and export materials, and striving to comprehensively complete the transportation of materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. At the same time, we must strive to improve the accuracy of plans and resolutely overcome the phenomenon of plans falling through; we must accelerate commodity loading and unloading to ensure timely completion of operations; for oil tankers, we must unload them as soon as they arrive, doing everything possible to save transportation capacity; and we must also coordinate with railway and transportation departments to fully utilize all available transportation capacity, achieving "inserting needles into gaps" and "filling in whenever there is space."

	2.	Do a good job in short-distance transportation. In order to accelerate commodity circulation and further invigorate the urban and rural economy, we must, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, rely on the people's communes to do a good job in short-distance transportation. While assisting communes in planning production and commodity circulation, we will also help them with transportation planning, so that production, circulation, and transportation are closely integrated; under the overall arrangement of rural labor, we will assist communes in establishing specialized urban and rural material transportation teams to better complete material transportation tasks; in the purchase and supply contracts signed with communes, we must include transportation clauses, clarifying the time, location, and freight rates for handover, so that the responsibilities of both parties are fixed in the form of a contract. For commercial departments' own short-distance transportation tools, we must strengthen management and continuously improve utilization rates.

	3.	Comprehensively and thoroughly carry out direct-line transportation. We must adhere to the principles of benefiting production, benefiting supply, and saving costs, achieving the goal of using the shortest time, taking the closest route, spending the least money, and using the least labor and transportation capacity to organize commodity transportation in a faster, better, and more economical way. All industrial products distributed from top to bottom with direct delivery conditions and agricultural and sideline products with direct transportation conditions must be directly transported from the place of origin to grassroots supply points or stations, docks, and factories. Second-level wholesale stations dealing in industrial products must ensure the planning of commodity flows within the entire business scope, and directly deliver goods to grassroots points that can bypass the county-level business links. In carrying out this work, we must achieve planning at every level and talk about direct transportation everywhere. Not only should major commodities have flow plans, but also comprehensive flow plans for other commodities should be made, striving to basically achieve direct commodity transportation before National Day.

	4.	Vigorously promote the "marshal leading logistics" transportation method and improve technical loading capacity. "Marshal leading logistics" is an effective way to accelerate commodity transportation and save transportation capacity. We must actively and proactively cooperate with transportation departments to formulate plans. Based on the principles of not exceeding the specified height and load, not delaying scheduled operation, and ensuring commodity safety, we will widely adopt the "marshal leading logistics" transportation method on various transportation lines such as railways, highways, and waterways. We should strive to carry as much as possible. We must actively cooperate with relevant departments to improve packaging methods, reasonably reduce packaging volume according to commodity performance, especially for major agricultural products such as cotton and hemp. We must further improve packaging and loading methods, striving to reach and exceed the technical loading capacity standards of vehicles and ships. We must also vigorously organize the combined loading of light and heavy materials, doing everything possible to transport more goods with fewer vehicles and ships to accelerate commodity transportation.

	5.	Launch a great technical revolution. Based on the principles of "using indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods, continuously improving, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials," we will focus on improving work efficiency and reducing heavy physical labor, and launch a great technical revolution. In warehousing, we will actively and systematically realize the vehiclization of handling, and the semi-mechanization or mechanization of conveying, loading and unloading, stacking, and unloading; in transportation, we will actively innovate transportation tools and loading methods to improve transportation efficiency, and strive to innovate technology in many ways. In carrying out the technical revolution, we must prevent the occurrence of unrealistic waste tendencies.
	While carrying out the technical revolution, we will actively carry out a cultural revolution, continuously improve our political awareness, professional skills, and cultural level, and strive for everyone to develop in the direction of being both red and expert.

	6.	Strengthen commodity maintenance and ensure material safety. In terms of fire prevention, we must implement the policy of "prevention first, supplemented by elimination," and start from many aspects to block all loopholes that may cause fires; in terms of preventing mildew, we must strengthen the management and control of warehouse temperature and humidity, and pay special attention to prevention during the rainy season; we must strengthen the feeding and management of fresh commodities. Strive for all warehouses to basically meet the "six without and one fast" standard.

	7.	Vigorously assist the commercial departments of the people's communes in doing a good job in material storage and safekeeping, especially for the safekeeping of agricultural and sideline products. According to their storage volume, we must properly arrange storage capacity and storage equipment such as tarpaulins and fire protection; and help establish necessary storage systems, train storage personnel, and improve fire organizations to strengthen the storage and safekeeping work of the people's communes.

	8.	Implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and strive to save management costs. In the spirit of "hard work, clever work, and careful calculation," we should spend as little money as possible, or even no money, utilize waste materials, and improve warehousing and transportation conditions by ourselves. We should strengthen the maintenance of all equipment such as warehouses, vehicles, ships, and tarpaulin equipment to extend their service life. In the case of insufficient storage capacity, based on the spirit of combining dedicated warehouses with comprehensive utilization, we should change the unevenness of warehouse workload between departments and seasons to fully utilize storage capacity and expand material storage.

    用最短的时间走最近的路线
    储运工作会议代表向全国商业储运工作者提出八项倡议
    新华社25日讯　出席商业部召开的全国储运工作会议的全体代表向全国商业系统的储运工作者提出了八项倡议，作为共同奋斗的目标，在储运工作方面开展一个红旗运动。这八项倡议是：
    一、加强运输工作的计划管理。在1959年运输任务十分繁重的形势下，我们坚决本着全国一盘棋和“让、援、挤”的精神，积极地协同铁道、交通部门妥善地安排商品的运输计划，首先保证有关全国性的和出口物资的运输，力争全面完成工农业生产和人民生活所需物资的运输。同时，要努力提高计划的准确性，坚决克服计划落空的现象；要加速商品装卸工作，保证按时完成作业，对运油槽车，要做到随到随卸，千方百计地节约运力；还要协同铁道、交通部门，充分利用一切可以利用的运力，作到“见缝插针”、
  “有空即补”。
    二、作好短途运输工作。为了加速商品流转，进一步活跃城乡经济，我们要在各级党委的领导下，依靠人民公社作好短途运输工作。在协助公社规划生产、商品流通的同时，并帮助作好运输规划，使生产、流通与运输密切结合起来；在统筹安排农村劳动力的前提下，协助公社建立城乡物资运输专业队伍，以更好地完成物资的运输任务；在与公社签订的收购、供应合同中，要包括运输方面的条款，明确交接时间、地点和运价，使双方应负的责任用合同的形式固定下来。对商业部门自有的短途运输工具，要加强管理，不断提高利用率。
    三、全面深入地开展直线运输。我们要本着有利于生产、有利于供应和节约费用的原则，做到用最短的时间，走最近的路线，花最省的费用，以最少的劳力和运力，多快好省地组织商品的运输。凡自上而下进行分配的有直达条件的工业品和有直运条件的农副产品，都保证作到由起运地直运基层供应点或车站、码头、工厂。经营工业品的二级批发站，要保证做好整个经营范围内的商品流向规划，对可以不经过县级经营环节的基层点都做到直接发货。在开展这一工作中，要做到层层搞规划，处处讲直运，不只是主要商品要有流向规划，对其他商品也要做好全面的流向规划，力争在国庆节前基本实现商品直运化。
    四、大力推广“元帅带后勤”的运输方法和提高技术装载量。“元帅带后勤”，是加速商品运输、节约运力的有效办法。我们要积极地、主动地与交通运输部门协作，订出规划，根据不超过规定的标高和载重、不误正点运行、保证商品安全的原则，在铁路、公路、航路等各个运输线上，广泛采用“元帅带后勤”的运输方法，凡是能够带运的，努力做到带运。要积极配合有关部门改进包装方法，根据商品性能，合理缩小包装体积，尤其是对棉花、麻类等主要农产品，要进一步改进包装和装载方法，力争达到和超过车船的技术装载量标准。还要大力组织轻重物资配装，千方百计地做到少用车船多运货物，以加速商品的运输。
    五、大闹技术革命。根据“土法上马、土洋结合、不断提高、因地制宜、就地取材”的方针，以提高工作效率、减轻重体力劳动为中心，大搞技术革命。在仓储方面，积极地、有步骤地实现搬运车子化，输送、装卸、码垛、下货半机械化或机械化；在运输方面，积极地革新运输工具和装载方法，提高运输效能，力求多方面地革新技术。在开展技术革命中，要防止发生不切合实际的浪费偏向。
    在开展技术革命的同时，积极地开展文化革命，不断地提高政治觉悟、业务水平和文化水平，每个人都向又红又专的方向奋斗。
    六、加强商品养护，确保物资安全。在防火方面，要贯彻“以防为主，以消为辅”的方针，从多方面入手，堵塞一切可能引起火灾的漏洞；在防霉变方面，要加强仓库温度、湿度的管理与控制，在雨汛季节要特别注意防范；对鲜活商品要加强饲养和管理工作。争取所有仓库基本达到“六无一快”的标准。
    七、大力协助人民公社商业部门做好物资储存保管工作，尤其对农副产品的保管，要根据其储存量妥善安排仓容和苫垫、消防等保管设备；并帮助建立必要的保管制度，训练保管人员和健全消防组织，以加强人民公社的仓储保管工作。
    八、贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，努力节省管理费用。本着“苦干、巧干、精打细算”的精神，尽量少花钱，甚至不花钱，利用废材，自己动手，努力改善仓储、运输条件，并加强对库房、车船、苫垫器材等一切设备的保养，以延长其使用年限。在仓容不足的情况下，根据专仓专用和综合利用相结合的精神，改变部门间、季节间仓库忙闲不均的情况，以充分利用仓容，扩大物资存量。
