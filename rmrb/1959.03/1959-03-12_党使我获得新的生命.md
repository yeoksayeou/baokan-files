    The Party Gave Me a New Life
    Chen Yuan

    Today, on the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Beijing, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and from now on my life has entered a new stage. I am extremely excited.

    When Beijing was liberated, I was almost seventy years old. Looking back on the old society, I really wasted those seventy years in a muddle. Because I didn't have the guidance of correct thought at that time, I experienced a tortuous and circuitous life. It wasn't until after liberation, under the care and education of the Party, that I gradually embarked on the correct path of striving for truth. The process of ten years is also a process of self-revolution and self-transformation under the education of the Party, which is naturally a very arduous process for an intellectual who has grown up in the old society for a long time.

    I was born in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, China was suffering from both internal and external troubles, and was subjected to cruel oppression, exploitation, bullying, and humiliation by imperialism and feudal rule. The country was plagued with disasters. When I was young in Guangzhou, I was influenced by some reformist ideas and once had the ambition to save the country. I participated in some anti-imperialist and anti-feudal activities at that time. After the Revolution of 1911, I once held political positions and came to Beijing. At that time, I thought that the Qing Dynasty had been overthrown and the country would gradually become rich and strong. But in reality, things went against my wishes. The country became increasingly chaotic and worse. Seeing the national affairs deteriorating and the warlords fighting for years, I felt lost in my thoughts, felt that I was born in troubled times and didn't know what to do. I just felt that participating in such politics was a dirty thing, so I wanted to devote myself to teaching and writing, holding the attitude of "preserving my life in troubled times and not seeking fame among the princes." This is how I spent decades.

    Ten years ago, the liberation of Beijing, such an earth-shattering change, awakened me from my dream. After liberation, all kinds of new things were educating me every day. I saw for the first time a disciplined army, hard-working and simple cadres, and a political party that thought of the interests of the people. I was surprised and admired. I have been in Beijing for decades, and I can truly say that I have experienced many changes. None of the rulers was not trying to get something by trickery or force and sucking the people's blood. Such a new government is really like the "people of the Xi Huang era" mentioned in ancient books. Not only have I never seen it, but it has never existed in history. I only began to realize that the road to China's independence and prosperity that we longed for is the revolutionary road led by the Communist Party of China.

    These preliminary understandings played a great educational role for me at the time. At the same time, I began to study new theoretical books, which I had never had the opportunity to read in the past. In my studies, I initially understood some theories of the Chinese revolution and the position of the Chinese revolution in the international communist cause, and initially recognized the nature of the Communist Party and the people's regime. Therefore, I began to participate in political activities.

    The anti-imperialist struggle at Fu Jen Catholic University in 1950 gave me my first experience in actual political struggle. In the past, I had no understanding of imperialist cultural aggression, thinking that old China was in decline in everything, and education was even more underdeveloped. They came across the ocean to run schools for the Chinese, and it was not with bad intentions. Therefore, at the beginning of the struggle, my ideological understanding was vague. It was the Party's timely education that enabled me to gradually recognize the true face of imperialism in the struggle, and to recognize that imperialist elements were carrying out cultural aggression in religious disguise in order to enslave Chinese youth. The Party gave me the strength to fight and pointed out the direction for me to fight. The Party led the teachers and students of the whole school to achieve victory in the struggle, enabling me to ideologically draw a line with imperialist elements in the struggle, and my ideological awareness was greatly improved. As a Chinese person, I felt an unparalleled sense of national pride in the victory of the struggle against imperialist elements. I began to realize that only the Chinese people under a superior social system can truly stand up; only with the leadership of the Communist Party can the ideal of China's independence and prosperity be realized, and it is possible to run cultural and educational undertakings well. From then on, I became more convinced and supported the Party.

    In order to further receive ideological transformation and practical training, the Party gave me the opportunity to participate in the land reform in the Southwest. This movement allowed me, a so-called intellectual who had only read books and read them rigidly in the past, to have contact with the vast number of peasants for the first time. In the movement, I received a very profound class education. I participated in the land reform in Nanquan, Ba County, and visited Anren, Dayi. The peasants' tearful accusations and realistic education enabled me to recognize the reactionary essence of the landlord class, as well as the feudal rule and cruel exploitation and oppression they had carried out for a long time on the vast number of peasants in the economic, political, and ideological fields. I recognized that this reactionary feudal system restricted the development of productive forces, was the root cause of our nation's long-term invasion and oppression, poverty and backwardness, and was a fundamental obstacle to the country's industrialization. In the sharp class struggle, my thoughts and feelings underwent drastic changes. I realized the greatness of the people's power and the wisdom of the working people. In the past, I thought I was great because I had read a few books. This time, standing in front of the working people, I felt the ignorance of the old intellectuals for the first time.

    Due to the change in class feelings, my views on historical documents and records also changed during the land reform. I recognized the class nature of the historical books I had studied in the past. I remember in Dayi, I saw a carved marble monument, which praised the completion of the local weir. The inscription said: "When the weir is completed, the year is celebrated with great abundance. Each peasant, thinking of the source when drinking water, commemorates it by carving on stone. Truly a great event." These are words I am so familiar with, words that are often encountered in historical records. But the peasant brothers told me that in order to build the weir, the landlords seized the land and forced people to work day and night. Many peasant families were broken up. After the weir was built, the harvest increased, but the rent and deposits were also increased, making it impossible to live. I saw many such praising inscriptions, and at the same time, I saw the pain and tears of the peasant brothers between the lines of these inscriptions. The landlord class’s carved beams and painted buildings hung plaques that said "benevolent family" and "kind heart", which formed a strong contrast with the private courts and water prisons set up in their deep houses. For thousands of years, the exploiting classes have wielded words and cultivated intellectuals to serve their own class. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all provided by the working people, but intellectuals not only think it is deserved and a matter of course, but also help the ruling class "preach the scriptures and defend the Tao", and even say "shamans, doctors, and craftsmen are not worthy of gentlemen." This is extremely unfair and unreasonable. I didn't understand such a simple truth before. This actual struggle of land reform gave me a vivid lesson, which caused drastic changes in my political thought and academic thought.

    The day after returning from the land reform, I participated in the Three-Anti Campaign and the ideological remolding study for teachers. During the learning process, the Party was always concerned about the slightest progress in my thinking. Many comrades from the municipal party committee and the school party organization helped me analyze and study in a concrete and detailed manner. Thanks to the Party's patient education and the help of the masses, I was able to systematically understand the problems existing in my past experience and thinking, criticize wrong ideas, determine the direction of progress, and gradually establish a revolutionary outlook on life.

    When the Party put forward the call to advance towards science, because I had different views on my past academic research, and due to the limitations of my ideological level, it was difficult to start with new scientific research for a while. At this time, the Party's leading comrades promptly reminded me and provided assistance in various aspects, suggesting that some of my past works still had useful value and should be compiled and printed for reference. Since the establishment of the four departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1955, which organized scientists, in 1956, under the leadership of the Party, a twelve-year science plan was formulated to comprehensively arrange the national scientific research according to the needs of national construction, distinguishing priorities and carrying out planned work. In this plan, I saw the brilliant prospects of the scientific cause. Because I participated in these tasks, my ideological awareness has also been greatly improved.

    During the anti-Rightist struggle the year before last, at the beginning, in the face of great storms, I could not see the sinister faces of some Rightist elements for a while, and underestimated the nature and seriousness of the anti-Rightist struggle, and had a sentimentalism towards some Rightist elements. Thanks to the timely help of the Party and comrades, I gradually recognized that this was a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, gradually strengthened my ability to identify things, improved my awareness, distinguished right from wrong, strengthened my class stance, and gradually drew a line with the bourgeois Rightists in politics and ideology.

    I am an old man nearly eighty years old. I have experienced a long life in the old society. It can be said that I am a person who has experienced many hardships. In the past, I also yearned for light, but all I saw was darkness. I also hoped to see an ideal politics, but for decades it has been disappointing. I also had some ambitions to save the country, but under the reactionary rule, this ambition was根本impossible to realize. After liberation, the Party led the people of the whole country to make unprecedented brilliant achievements and realize all the people's righteous and good wishes. The Party gave me light, the Party made me understand the truth, and the Party made me understand the objective laws of social development and the great historical mission of the working class. It made me determined to strive to participate in the advanced organization of the working class.

    On the one hand, I feel that I heard the truth too late. When advanced people and advanced intellectuals had already been unyielding and bravely fighting for the people's revolutionary cause, I had no understanding of such a great cause in the past and failed to participate in the ranks of the revolution. I really feel ashamed of the people. But on the other hand, I am also grateful and thankful for the Party's care and cultivation over the years. The Party has educated me with the communist world view, so that I can gain a new political life in my twilight years, so I feel glorious.

    The self-transformation in the past ten years has been a process of discarding the old and establishing the new. Today, as a new party member, I must strictly demand myself and continue to transform myself. I take the present as a new starting point for future struggle, and constantly revolutionize myself in thought and work, so that I can better shoulder the tasks assigned to me by the Party. I will contribute everything to the realization of the highest ideal of mankind - communism with infinite loyalty!

    党使我获得新的生命
    陈垣
    在北京解放整整十年的今天，我光荣地加入了中国共产党，从此我的生命开始了新的阶段，我感到万分兴奋。
    北京解放的时候，我年已将七十，回想起在旧社会，真是糊糊涂涂地虚度了七十年，由于那时没有正确思想的指导，经历了曲折迂回的大半生，直到解放以后，在党的关怀教育下，才逐渐走上了为真理而奋斗的正确道路。十年的过程，也就是在党教育下自我革命、自我改造的过程，这对一个长时期在旧社会生长的知识分子来说，自然也是非常艰巨的过程。
    我出生在清朝季年，当时中国正是外患内忧，受到帝国主义、封建统治残酷的压迫剥削、欺凌侮辱，国家灾难重重。我青年时在广州，受到些维新思想影响，也曾抱有救国之志，参加了一些当时的反帝反封建活动。辛亥以后，曾一度担任过政治职务，来到北京，我当时以为，清朝统治已被推翻，国家会逐渐富强起来，而实际上事与愿违，国家反日益混乱，越搞越糟。眼见国事日非、军阀混战连年，自己思想没有出路，感到生于乱世，无所适从，只觉得参加这样的政治是污浊的事情，于是就想专心致力于教学与著述，抱有“苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯”的态度，就这样度过了几十年。
    十年以前，北京解放，这样翻天复地的变革，才把我从梦中唤醒。解放后各种新鲜事物，天天都在教育着我，我初次看到了纪律严明的军队，勤劳朴实的干部，一切为人民利益着想的政党，我感到惊奇，感到佩服。我在北京几十年，真可以说是历尽沧桑，看过多少次兴亡衰盛，没有一次当政者不是巧取豪夺，吸民膏脂，而像这样的新政府，真像古书上所说的“羲皇上人”，不但我没有看见过，就是历史上也从来没有过。我才开始发现：我们所向往的中国独立富强的道路，就是中国共产党所领导的革命的道路。
    这些初步的认识，对我来说，当时起着很大教育作用。与这同时，我开始学习着新的理论书籍，这些书都是我在过去从没有机会读到的。在学习中，我初步理解了一些中国革命的理论，及中国革命在国际共产主义事业中的地位，初步认识了共产党和人民政权的性质，因此，我开始参加了政治活动。
    1950年辅仁大学的反帝斗争，使我第一次受到实际政治斗争的锻炼。我过去对帝国主义的文化侵略是没有认识的，以为旧中国百事雕敝，教育更不发达，他们远涉重洋来替中国人办学校，总不是坏意。因此在斗争开始，我的思想认识是模糊的，是党的及时教育，才使我在斗争中逐步认清帝国主义的真实面貌，认清帝国主义分子是披着宗教外衣来进行文化侵略，以奴化中国青年。党给了我斗争的力量，指给我斗争的方向。党领导着全校师生取得斗争的胜利，使我在斗争中，和帝国主义分子在思想上划清了界限，思想觉悟提高一大步。和帝国主义分子进行斗争的胜利，作为一个中国人民，我感到无比的民族自豪感，开始认识到只有在优越的社会制度下的中国人民，才能真正站起来；只有有了共产党的领导，才能实现中国独立富强的理想，才有可能办好文化教育等事业。从此我对党就更加相信和拥护。
    为了更进一步得到思想改造和实际锻炼，党给予我到西南参加土地改革的机会。这次运动，使我这样一个过去死读书、读死书的所谓知识分子，第一次和广大农民有了接触，在运动里，我受到一次极深刻的阶级教育。我参加了巴县南泉的土地改革，并参观了大邑安仁。农民的血泪控诉和现实的教育，使我认清了地主阶级的反动本质，以及他们长期骑在广大农民头上所进行的经济、政治、思想上的封建统治和残酷的剥削压迫，认清这反动的封建制度束缚了生产力，是我们民族长期被侵略受压迫、穷困和落后的根源，是国家工业化的根本障碍。在尖锐的阶级斗争中，我的思想感情发生着急剧的变化。我认识了群众力量的伟大和劳动人民的智慧。自己从前念过几本书，就自以为了不得，这一次，站在劳动人民的面前，才第一次感到旧知识分子的无知。
    由于阶级感情的变化，在土改中，我对历史文献记载等的看法，也有了改变，认出了过去所钻研的历史书籍中的阶级性。记得在大邑，我看见了一个镂花大理石的纪念碑，是称颂当地堰塘修成的碑，碑上说：“堰成，岁歌大有，各农民饮水思源，相与勒石纪念，诚盛举也。”这是我多么熟习的字句，这类字句是在历史记载里常常会遇到的。但是农民弟兄告诉我，为修堰塘，地主霸占了土地，又加日夜拉工，多少农民妻离子散，修堰塘后收成增多，更是加租加押，无法生活。我看到很多这样称颂的碑碣，同时也看到了这些刻石上字里行间农民兄弟的辛酸血泪。地主阶级雕梁画栋上挂着“积善人家”“宅心仁厚”的匾额，和他们深宅后院私设的公堂，水牢吊牢等等，形成了极强烈的对比。几千年来，剥削阶级操持着文字，培养出为其本阶级服务的知识分子。衣食住行，无一事物不是劳动人民供养，而知识分子不但认为受之无愧、理所当然，而且还帮助统治阶级“传经卫道”，还说什么“巫医百工，君子不齿”，这是极不公平、极不合理的事情。这样简单的真理，我以前全不明白，这次土改的实际斗争中，给我上了活生生的一课，使我在政治思想和学术思想上起了剧烈的变化。
    土改回来的次日，我参加了三反和教师思想改造学习。在学习过程中，党无时无刻不在关心着我思想上的点滴进步，市委和学校党组织的很多同志，具体地细致地帮助我分析研究。由于党的耐心教育和群众的帮助，我才有可能比较系统地认识了自己的过去经历和思想中存在的问题，批判了错误思想，确定了前进方向，逐步树立起革命人生观。
    在党提出向科学进军的号召时，我因对自己过去的学术研究，看法已有不同，而由于思想水平的限制，一时对新的科学研究，又很难着手。就在这时候，党的领导同志又及时向我提醒，并给与各方面的帮助，提出我过去的某些著作，尚有可用之处，应当整理印出，以供参考。自从1955年科学院成立了四个学部，把科学家组织起来，1956年，在党的领导下制定了十二年科学规划，把全国的科学研究按着国家建设需要统筹安排，分出轻重缓急，有计划地进行，在这规划上我看到了科学事业的绚灿远景。自己因为参加了这些工作，思想意识上也得到不少提高。
    前年反右派斗争，开始时，在大风大浪的面前，我一时看不出某些右派分子的阴险面貌，对反右派斗争的性质和严重性也估计不足，对某些右派分子有温情主义。由于党和同志们的及时帮助，才使我逐渐认清这是政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，逐渐加强了对事物的识别能力，提高了觉悟，辨明了大是大非，坚定了阶级立场，逐渐和资产阶级右派，在政治上和思想上划清了界限。
    我是一个年近八十的老人，在旧社会经历了漫长的岁月，可以说是饱经忧患的人，过去我也曾渴望着光明，但所看到的都是黑暗；也曾希望见到理想的政治，但几十年来都使人失望。也曾有过一些救国之志，但在反动统治下，这志愿根本也不可能实现。解放后，党领导着全国人民作出了史无前例的辉煌成就，实现了人们的一切正义的善良的愿望。党使我得到了光明，党使我认识了真理，党使我懂得了社会发展的客观规律和工人阶级的伟大历史使命。使我有决心争取参加到工人阶级的先进组织。
    一方面我感到闻道太晚，在先进的人们、先进的知识分子早已为人民革命事业不屈不挠英勇奋斗的时候，而我过去却一直对这样伟大事业毫无认识，未能参加到革命的行列，实觉愧对人民。但一方面，我也庆幸和感谢党多年以来的关怀与培养，党用共产主义世界观教育了我，使我能在垂暮之年，获得新的政治生命，因此我感到光荣。
    十年来的自我改造，是一个革故鼎新的过程，今天作为一个新党员，我更要严格地要求自己，继续改造。我以现在作为今后奋斗的新起点，在思想上和工作上不断革命，以便能够更好地担负起党所交给我的任务，我要无限忠诚地为实现人类的最高理想——共产主义贡献一切！
