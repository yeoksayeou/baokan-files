Visiting the Taishan Chemical Factory
By our reporter Zhou Yongkang

The Shanghai Taishan Chemical Factory is the largest saccharin factory in China. However, because the waste gas—sulfur dioxide—left over from the production of saccharin flies out in large quantities, it affects the surrounding environmental hygiene. The factory can only produce four or five batches of saccharin a day, and each batch only uses sixty or seventy kilograms of materials. For a long time, saccharin production has not increased. Many workers have tried every possible way to help the leadership brainstorm ideas. They said: "There must be chemical components in the waste gas, why not recycle it for reuse?" The factory's Party branch supported the workers' suggestion and called on them to do it themselves. Before long, a closed-loop recycling equipment appeared in the saccharin workshop. The workers also chemically treated the recovered sulfur dioxide and turned it into sodium bisulfite, an important raw material for saccharin.

With no more waste gas flying out, saccharin production immediately jumped more than four times. At the production rate at that time, sodium bisulfite worth 140,000 yuan could be recovered every year. In other words, this raw material used for producing 100,000 kilograms of saccharin no longer needed to be bought from outside.

The entire factory quickly launched a treasure hunt centered on the comprehensive utilization of waste materials and the expansion of raw material sources. Many waste material attacking battle groups were established in the workshop. These groups experimented one after another and achieved one victory after another. After warehouse worker Xia Handong and several department cadres saw that the workers in the workshop used manganese dioxide scraps produced during saccharin oxidation to make manganic chloride, which was worth more than 10,000 yuan per ton, new scraps of manganese chloride were produced. Next, these scraps were made into manganese carbonate, a new raw material with a higher value than manganic chloride. In order to mass-produce this important raw material used in the telecommunications industry, they figured out a set of indigenous equipment. Without a mixer, they hung a bamboo pole on the beam and mixed it manually. Without a drying room, they made more than twenty briquette stoves. The total cost was only more than 500 yuan, and the first batch of manganese carbonate produced was worth more than 10,000 yuan.

The mass technical revolution opened the door to the treasure trove of waste materials. Last year, the workers of the Taishan Factory successfully extracted more than 20 kinds of important chemical raw materials from the flying foul gas, flowing sewage, and waste slag used for filling rivers and paving roads one after another. The factory, which originally only produced saccharin, has become a comprehensive factory with more than 20 kinds of products.

Perhaps some people will think that the workers in the Taishan Factory must have a very high level of education and very strong technical strength. Actually, this is not the case. Here, there are not many people who can really understand chemical equations. Most of the workers only have a junior high school education, but they are not intimidated by chemical equations. They said: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who put their heart into it. With hands and brains, waste can be turned into gold." They broke the mysterious view of chemistry, bravely charged into battle, and studied diligently. Several young people in the antibiotic raw material workshop, Shen Genchu, Zhou Zhixin, Gu Keqiang, etc., saw that the supply of bromine raw materials could not keep up, so they thought of using waste liquid for recycling. At the beginning, they worked hard for four consecutive days without success. Later, while continuing to work, they read materials, asked technicians when they didn't understand, and consulted veteran workers when they couldn't figure it out. Finally, they took down this bunker and ensured the normal production of antibiotic raw materials. Although Shen Genchu and others do not have a high level of education, production practice has greatly enriched their experience. They recently wrote a paper of more than 7,000 words, specifically introducing the experience of waste acid recovery and utilization.

I visited several workers in the Taishan Factory, and they all told me in unison: To utilize waste materials well and use them reasonably, it cannot be simply regarded as a technical issue, the main thing is to put politics in command. If this is not the case, it will also cause new waste. The Taishan Factory pays great attention to starting from a global perspective and weighing the pros and cons when utilizing each type of waste. They resolutely do not do things that are only beneficial to the factory but detrimental or less beneficial to the entire construction cause. This point can be explained more clearly with a story.

Last year, when the old worker Wang Yuequan was studying technology at the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory, he saw that they had a byproduct of chloramphenicol that was difficult to handle. He brought it back to Shanghai, refined it, and made an intermediate of chloramphenicol. Later, he used the waste material transported from the Northeast for mass production. Not long after, people from the Northeast came to exchange experience in this area, and some people in the factory secretly became anxious: This is not good, we have successfully researched this thing, if they learn it, we will not get waste material in the future, what should we do? Wang Yuequan said to them humorously: "It is best if the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory can utilize it themselves, so they don't have to transport the waste material from afar, and we don't have to send the finished product back over a long distance. If they don't give it to us, we will find other waste materials. There is such a big China, are we afraid of not having waste material? If there is no waste material in the factory, we will find it outside the factory; if there is no waste material in the north, we will find it in the south; if there is no waste material on the ground, we will find it underground; when there is really no waste material anywhere, you can worry about it!" As soon as the people from the Northeast arrived, the old worker introduced the entire production process of manufacturing this raw material to the other party in detail. The spirit of putting others before oneself and taking care of the overall situation of the Taishan Factory has been praised by many factories in the past.

The year of hard work of the Taishan Factory has pointed out a direction for chemical factories to carry out technological revolution. The factory's experience in comprehensive utilization of raw materials has attracted widespread attention from chemical factories in various places. The employees of the Taishan Factory are also becoming more and more courageous in the battle. A few days ago, they were working overnight to calculate and determine the war plan for raw materials from waste this year, determined to make the Taishan Factory a "three-no factory" with no waste gas in the sky, no waste material on the ground, and no waste liquid underground before this year's National Day, so that waste materials can generate heat and light in socialist construction.

    访泰山化工厂
    本报记者　周永康
    上海泰山化工厂是国内最大的一家糖精厂，可是因为生产糖精时残余下来的废气——二氧化硫大量飞出去，会影响周围的环境卫生。厂里每天只能生产四、五批糖精，每一批的投料也只有六、七十公斤。长时期以来，糖精的产量一直没有提高。许多工人千方百计地帮助领导上动脑筋，他们说：废气中一定还有化学成分，为什么不回收再用呢？厂党支部支持了工人的建议，号召他们自己动手。过不久，糖精车间出现了一套密闭式的回收设备，工人们还把回收下来的二氧化硫加以化学处理，变成了糖精的重要原料重亚硫酸钠。
    废气不飞出去了，糖精的产量马上跳上去四倍多。按当时的产量，每年还可以回收价值十四万元的重亚硫酸钠。也就是说，生产十万公斤糖精所用的这种原料不用再到外面去买了。
    全厂很快就展开了一场以综合利用废料、扩大原料来源为中心的夺宝大战。车间里成立了许许多多攻废料的战斗小组，这些小组一个接一个的实验，获得了一次又一次的胜利。仓库工人夏咸栋和几个科室干部看见车间里工人用糖精氧化时产生的二氧化锰下脚，制成了一种价值一万多元一吨的糠氯酸以后，又产生了新的下脚氯化锰，接上来，把这种下脚又制成了一种比糠氯酸价值更高的新原料炭酸锰。为了大量生产这种电讯工业上用的重要原料，他们自己想办法搞了一套土设备。没有搅拌机，就在梁上挂根竹竿，用人工拌；没有烘房，做了二十多只煤球炉。全部费用只有五百多元，而做出来的第一批炭酸锰价值有一万多元。
    群众性的技术革命，冲开了废物宝库的大门。去年泰山厂工人接二连三的从飞走的臭气、流掉的污液、填河铺路的废渣中，先后提取成功了二十多种重要化工原料，原来只有糖精一种产品的工厂，一变而成为一个有二十多种产品的综合性工厂了。
    也许有人会以为泰山厂的工人文化程度一定很高，技术力量一定很强。其实不然，这里，真正看得懂化学方程式的人没有几个，绝大部分工人只有初中程度，但他们没有被化学方程式吓倒。他们说：“天下无难事，只怕有心人，双手加个脑，废物变黄金。”他们打破了对化学的神秘观，一边勇敢地冲锋陷阵，一边刻苦地学习研究。抗菌素原料车间沈根初、周志新、顾克强等几个年青人，看到溴素原料供应不上，就动脑筋想利用废液回收。开始，接连苦干了四天，都没有成功。后来他们一面继续再干，一面翻阅资料，看不懂找技术人员，做不通请教老工人，最后终于拿下了这个碉堡，保证了抗菌素原料的正常生产。沈根初等虽然文化水平不高，生产实践大大丰富了他们的经验，他们最近还写了一篇长达七千多字的论文，专门介绍废酸的回收和利用的经验。
    我在泰山厂访问过几个工人，他们不约而同地对我说：废物要利用得好，用得合理，不能单单看成是技术问题，主要的还是政治挂帅。如果不是这样，也会造成新的浪费。泰山厂在利用每一种废物时，很注意从全局观点出发，权衡利害。只对本厂有利，对整个建设事业不利或少利的事情，他们坚决不干。这一点还是用一个故事更能说得清楚些。
    老工人王月泉去年在东北药厂学习技术时，看到他们那里有一种合霉素的下脚，很难处理，他把它带回上海加以提炼又制成了一种合霉素的中间体，以后就用东北运来的废料进行大量生产。过了不久，东北派人来交流这方面的经验，厂里有些人暗地里着急起来了：这可不行，这东西是我们研究成功的，他们学会了，以后下脚不来了，我们咋办？王月泉幽默地对他们说：“东北药厂能自己利用，这再好也没有，省得他们老远把下脚运来，做了成品我们再长途送去。他们不给，我们再找别的。要找废料，偌大中国还怕没有。厂里没有，厂外去找；北方没有，南边去找；地上没有，地下去找；等到真的到处没有废物，你再着急吧！”老工人在东北来人一到，就把制造这种原料的全部生产过程详详细细介绍给对方。泰山厂这种先人后己、照顾大局的精神，过去曾经受到许多工厂的赞扬。
    泰山厂一年的苦战，给化工厂开展技术革命指出了一个方向，这个厂综合利用原料的经验已经引起了各地化工厂普遍的重视。泰山厂的职工也越战越勇，前几天，他们又在漏夜算账，确定今年向废物要原料的作战计划，决心在今年国庆以前，叫泰山厂成为一个天上无废气、地上无废料、地下无废液的“三无工厂”，叫废料在社会主义建设中发热发光。
