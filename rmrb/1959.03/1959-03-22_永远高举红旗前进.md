Always Hold High the Red Flag and Advance
By Our Correspondents Yuan Mu and Feng Senling
　　“Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory,” this is the expectation that Chairman Mao placed on the people of the old revolutionary base areas after liberation. Recently, when we revisited Yan'an, the sacred place of the revolution, and the old revolutionary base areas of northern Shaanxi, we felt very strongly that Chairman Mao's expectation is generating infinite power among the people of northern Shaanxi.
　　Among the more than 2.4 million hardworking and simple people of northern Shaanxi, we visited old heroes who bravely participated in the revolutionary struggle as early as the land revolution period, met soldiers of the people who took up arms to defend their hometowns and liberate all of China during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, and also the new generation who grew up under the glorious revolutionary tradition education during the construction period of recent years. Today, they are all contributing their full strength to the great socialist cause in their respective posts. The communist spirit of the people of northern Shaanxi, who have been utterly loyal to the Party and the revolutionary cause for many years, has left us with an unforgettable and profound impression.
　　Twenty Years as One Day
　　Starting from Panlong Town, fifty kilometers east of Yan'an City, along a narrow path, we entered a remote mountain village—Majiagou Village. It was here that when the Northern Shaanxi Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led by Comrade Liu Zhidan, came to this mountain village in 1935, a poor farmer named Shen Changlin took the lead in participating in the struggle against local tyrants and evil gentry. He once took out all the grain that he and his brothers had accumulated through years of hard work and dedicated it to the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. He became the company commander of the Red Guards. In the years that followed, when the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao led the national people's revolution in northern Shaanxi, because he enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, actively developed production, and supported the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, he was gloriously praised as a model Communist Party member.
　　Shen Changlin, who is already sixty-five years old this year, is still serving as the Communist Party branch secretary of the Majiagou Production Team of the Panlong People's Commune. With his strong physique and a high sense of responsibility for the collective interests of socialism, this old secretary still insists on taking on the most arduous task in the production team—herding sheep in the mountains every day. During the Spring Festival this year, all the commune members took a holiday and celebrated the festival happily. Shen Changlin still stepped across the frozen river early in the morning and climbed the snow-covered hills to herd sheep. When he returned at night, he called a meeting of the branch committee members to study the production plan and labor arrangement for the entire year of 1959 for the Majiagou Village Production Team.
　　For more than twenty years, Shen Changlin has always used his exemplary practical actions to advance along the socialist road with his fellow villagers. When the people drove away the Hu Zongnan bandit gang and rebuilt their homes, it was he who took the lead in establishing the first production mutual aid group in Majiagou Village; later, it was he who led the mutual aid group to develop into an agricultural production cooperative; and when the People's Commune was established last year, he was also the first in Majiagou Village to convey the Party Central Committee's resolution on the People's Commune to all the farmers. Whenever people recall the past suffering and think of today's happy life, they cannot help but praise Shen Changlin and say, "He is a red flag in our village that never fades."
　　From One Battlefield to Another
　　I don't know how many outstanding sons and daughters of the working people of northern Shaanxi once bravely rushed to the battlefield during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War in order to defend their hometowns and help their brothers and sisters all over the country who had suffered the same hardships as themselves to gain liberation. Some of them have already shed their last drop of blood for the cause of the people's liberation; some have returned to their hometowns and participated in the socialist construction cause.
　　In Mizhi County, Yulin Prefecture, we met Xue Yuanyang, a demobilized soldier from the Qingquan People's Commune. He joined the army as early as 1944 and was a veteran soldier who had served as a deputy company commander in the People's Liberation Army. In nearly ten years of combat life, Xue Yuanyang had fought in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and the Northeast, and had made ten major and minor contributions. To this day, he still has the bullet wound scars from the Taiyuan Campaign on his right arm. At that time, his right arm was hit by an enemy bullet, blood was flowing, and his entire arm was swollen and numb, but he still stubbornly held the machine gun and insisted on fighting.
　　In the autumn of 1953, he returned to his hometown after being demobilized. The next day, he went to the fields with a hoe on his shoulder. Within a few days, he was elected as the leader of the village's production mutual aid group. Soon, the mutual aid group developed into an agricultural production cooperative, and he was elected as the director of the cooperative. Last year, the farmers of Mizhi County worked together to build the Shajiadian Reservoir. People compared this project with the Shajiadian battle during the Liberation War, calling it the "Second Shajiadian Campaign." This fighter who had made contributions in the Shajiadian battle in the past once again showed the demeanor of a revolutionary soldier who despised any difficulties in this new battle, and made four contributions in this construction cause. The 180-member migrant worker team he led was always praised as the "Tiger Team" with soaring enthusiasm throughout the construction site during the more than six months of reservoir construction. In July, a flash flood washed away a gap in the almost completed reservoir dam. At this critical moment, Xue Yuanyang carried a sandbag weighing more than 100 pounds and led his partners, risking their lives, to jump into the chest-high flood to rescue the dam. After a day of fierce fighting, they finally repaired the gap and ensured the safety of the dam. In this reservoir construction project, Xue Yuanyang won three first-class awards and one second-class award among the county's migrant workers.
　　Live Up to the Expectations of the Forefathers
　　In contact with many of the younger generation in northern Shaanxi, we feel the profound influence left on them by the revolutionary forefathers everywhere. From Xie Shaowang, the 28-year-old branch secretary of the Zaoshuping Production Brigade of the Zichang People's Commune in Zichang County, we can feel that this influence is particularly strong.
　　Xie Shaowang is the nephew of Comrade Xie Zichang, one of the founders of the Northern Shaanxi Red Army. Along with Comrade Xie Zichang, ten members of Xie Shaowang's family gloriously sacrificed during the land revolution. Xie Shaowang was only three years old at that time. After he grew up in the loving care of the Party and the revolutionary family, a strong desire took root in his mind: "We must never disgrace our forefathers. Families like ours, how can we not be ahead of others in following the socialist road!?"
　　In the spring of 1953, when Xie Shaowang was twenty-two years old, he organized the first agricultural production cooperative of three poor peasant households in his hometown. With the consolidation and development of the agricultural cooperative, all the way to the establishment of the People's Commune last year, Xie Shaowang's moving stories of completely forgetting personal gains and losses for the socialist collective were widely spread among the villagers. When the agricultural cooperative was first established, there were no livestock, and there was a shortage of farm tools and seeds. Xie Shaowang took out the gold ring that his brother gave him as a souvenir and a piece of silk clothing material from his wedding, sold them for fifty-five yuan, bought livestock and farm tools, and invested them in the agricultural cooperative without compensation; when a member of the cooperative fell ill, he gave all the liter of white flour he had saved for his nursing child to that member; Xie Shaowang went to the county for a meeting. The responsible comrades in the county saw that his family was having financial difficulties at the time, and subsidized him with twenty yuan from the public relief funds. When he returned to the village, he gave all the money to several other families in difficulty. When others asked him gratefully what he would do, he smiled nonchalantly and said, "Our good days are ahead, and these difficulties will pass in the blink of an eye!"
　　During the Great Leap Forward last year, the commune members built hundreds of acres of paddy fields. Their mountain village planted some rice for the first time. At midnight one day in June, there was a heavy rain, and the flood washed away a gap in the waterproof trench of the paddy fields. The nearly mature rice was about to be completely submerged. Xie Shaowang led the commune members to rescue it three times late at night. He jumped into the flood and used his body to block the gap in the waterproof trench, ensuring the safety of the paddy fields. In the autumn, when the commune members celebrated last year's bumper harvest and ate the rice they had grown themselves, they said with emotion, "This white rice was exchanged for our Secretary Xie's life!"
　　What is recorded here are just a few very ordinary people and examples among countless heroic figures and achievements. A deputy commissioner of the Yan'an Prefecture who had worked here for many years said to us with passion, "The long and arduous revolutionary struggle has tempered the unparalleled hard work and extreme simplicity of the people of northern Shaanxi! Once such people believe that the Communist Party is their savior, they will unswervingly carry out all the Party's calls at any time, even if it means giving everything they have." Yes, precisely because the people of northern Shaanxi are people with such a lofty style, they were able to always hold high the red flag of revolution during the difficult war years. Today, in the great era of the Great Leap Forward in the construction of the motherland, they are working with the people of the whole country to jointly write the heroic epic of "one day equals twenty years!"

    永远高举红旗前进
    本报记者　袁木　冯森龄
      “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，这是毛主席在解放后对老根据地人民提出的期望。最近，当我们重访革命圣地延安和陕北老根据地时，我们十分强烈地感觉到，毛主席的这种期望，正在陕北人民身上发生着无限的力量。
    在二百四十多万勤劳朴素的陕北劳动人民中，我们访问过早在土地革命时期就英勇地参加了革命斗争的老英雄，见到过在抗日战争和解放战争时期拿起枪杆保卫家乡和解放全中国的人民子弟兵，还有那在光荣的革命传统教育下，在最近几年的建设时期中成长起来的新的一代。他们今天都在自己的岗位上为伟大的社会主义事业贡献着自己的全部力量。那种陕北人多少年来对党和革命事业忠心耿耿的共产主义精神，给我们留下了永远不能忘怀的深刻印象。
    二十年如一日
    从延安城东五十公里的蟠龙镇出发，沿着一条羊肠小道，我们进入了一个偏僻的山村——马家沟村。就是在这里，当1935年刘志丹同志领导的陕北工农红军来到这个山村的时候，一位名字叫做申长林的贫苦农民，带头参加了反对土豪恶霸的斗争。他曾把他们弟兄几个终年辛勤劳动积攒下的一些粮食，全部拿出来献给工农红军。他当了赤卫军的连长。而在以后党中央和毛主席在陕北领导全国人民革命的年代里，因为他热烈响应党的号召，积极发展生产，支援抗日战争和人民解放战争，被光荣地誉为模范中共党员。
    今年已经六十五岁的申长林，现在还担任着蟠龙人民公社马家沟生产队的中共支部书记。这位老书记，凭着自己结实的身子骨和对社会主义集体利益的高度责任感，现在还坚持担任着生产队里最辛苦的工作——每天上山放羊。今年春节里，全体社员都放了假，欢欢乐乐地过节。申长林仍然一清早就踏过冰河，爬上积满白雪的山岗去放羊。夜晚回来，他又召集支部委员们开会，研究马家沟村生产队1959年全年的生产规划和劳动力安排。
    二十多年如一日，申长林总是以他那模范的实际行动，在社会主义大道上同乡亲们一道前进。当人民赶走胡宗南匪帮重新建设自己家园的时候，就是他，带头在马家沟村建立起第一个生产互助组；以后，又是他，领导着互助组发展到农业生产合作社；而在去年建立人民公社的时候，也是他第一个在马家沟村把党中央关于人民公社的决议传达给全体农民。人们每当回忆过去的苦难和想到今天的幸福生活的时候，都不由得赞美申长林说：“他是我们村里一面永不褪色的红旗。”
    从一个战场到另一战场
    不知道有多少陕北劳动人民的优秀子弟，曾经在抗日战争和解放战争时期，为了保卫家乡，为了帮助全国各地同自己一样受尽苦难的兄弟姐妹们获得解放，英勇地奔赴战场。他们当中有的人已经为人民解放事业付出了自己最后一滴鲜血；有的人又重新回到家乡，参加了社会主义建设事业。
    在榆林专区米脂县，我们会见了清泉人民公社的复员军人薛元洋。他早在1944年就参了军，是人民解放军中担任过副连长的老战士。将近十年的战斗生活，薛元洋曾经转战陕西、山西、甘肃、宁夏和东北，立过大小十次战功。至今，他的右臂上还留有解放太原战役的枪弹伤痕。那时，他的右臂中了敌人的枪弹，鲜血直流，整个臂膀都肿得失去了知觉，但他仍然倔强地手握机枪，坚持战斗。
    1953年秋天他复员还乡，第二天他就扛着锄头下地。没几天，就被人们推举为村里的生产互助组组长，不久，互助组发展为农业生产合作社，他又被选举为社主任。去年，米脂全县农民协力修建沙家店水库，人们都把这个工程同当年解放战争时期的沙家店战斗相比，称它是“第二次沙家店战役”。这个当年在沙家店战斗中立功的战斗员，就在这次新的战斗中，又一次显示了他藐视任何困难的革命军人的风度，在这项建设事业中立了四次功。他所领导的一百八十人的一个民工大队，在半年多的修库过程中始终被全工地誉为干劲冲天的“老虎队”。7月间，暴涨的山洪把快要修好的水库大坝冲开了一个缺口，就在这个千钧一发的时刻，薛元洋扛起一百多斤重的沙包，带领着他的伙伴们，冒着生命的危险，跳进齐胸的洪水去抢救大坝，经过一天的激战，终于修好缺口，使大坝安然脱险。在这次水库修建工程中，薛元洋在全县民工中荣获三次甲等奖，一次乙等奖。
    不辜负先辈的期望
    在和许多年青一代的陕北人接触中，我们处处都感觉到革命的先辈们留给他们的深厚影响。而从子长县子长人民公社枣树坪生产大队支部书记、二十八岁的谢绍旺那里，可以感觉到这种影响表现得特别强烈。
    谢绍旺是陕北红军的创始人之一——谢子长同志的侄儿。谢绍旺的一家中，同谢子长同志一起，曾经有十个人在土地革命时期光荣牺牲。那时候谢绍旺才三岁。他在党和革命大家庭的抚爱中长大以后，一个强烈的愿望就在他的思想中扎了根：“决不能辱没自己的先辈。像我们这样的家庭，走社会主义的道路还能不走在别人前头！？”
    就在谢绍旺二十二岁的那年——1953年春天，他在自己的家乡组织起第一个三户贫农的农业生产合作社。随着农业社的巩固和发展，一直到去年人民公社的建立，谢绍旺那种为了社会主义集体而完全忘掉个人得失的动人故事，就在乡亲们当中广泛地传播开来。农业社刚建立的时候没有牲畜，缺少农具和子种，谢绍旺就把他哥哥送给他留作纪念的金戒指和他妻子结婚时的一件绸衣料，拿出去卖了五十五元钱，买了牲畜和农具，无代价地投入农业社；有一户社员病了，他把留给自己吃奶的孩子吃的一升白面也全部送给了那个社员；谢绍旺到县里开会，县里的负责同志看到当时他家里生活困难，从公家的救济款中补助了他二十元。回到村里，他把这些钱全部送给了其他几家困难户。别人感激地问到他自己怎么办的时候，他毫不在意地笑了笑说：“咱们的好日子在后头呢，现在这点困难一眨眼就过去了！”
    去年大跃进中，社员们修下几百亩水地。他们那个山村第一次种了一些水稻。6月间一天的午夜，下了暴雨，洪水把稻田的防水壕冲了一个缺口，眼看着快成熟的水稻，就要全部被淹死了。谢绍旺领导着社员们深夜去抢救了三次。他跳进洪水，用自己的身体堵住防水壕上的缺口，保证了稻田的安全。秋后，当社员们欢庆去年大丰收和吃着自己种的稻米时，都感动地说：“这白米是咱谢书记用性命换来的呵！”
    这里记述的只不过是无数英雄人物和业绩中几个极普通的人物和事例罢了。延安专区有一位在这里工作了多年的副专员曾经满怀激情地对我们说：“长期的艰苦的革命斗争，锻炼了陕北人民无比勤劳和极其朴实的气质！这样的人民一旦相信了共产党是他们的救星，任何时候他们就会对党的一切号召毫不退缩地去执行，哪怕付出自己的一切。”是的，正因为陕北人民是有着这样崇高风格的人民，他们才能在艰苦的战争时期始终高举着革命的红旗，而在今天，在祖国建设大跃进的伟大时代里，他们又和全国人民一道，共同写着“一天等于二十年”的英雄史诗！（附图片）
