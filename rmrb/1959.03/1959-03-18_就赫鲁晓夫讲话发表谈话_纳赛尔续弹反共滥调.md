Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 17th. President Nasser, in a special meeting with Middle East News Agency reporters late on the 16th, commented on Khrushchev's speech at the reception for the Iraqi government delegation, saying, "Mr. Khrushchev's defense of the communists in our country is unacceptable to the Arab people." He insisted that "helping and defending the communists in our country" "means despising the unity of our Republic's people."

When referring to Khrushchev's statement that Nasser "used the language of imperialists to arm himself when talking about communism and communists," Nasser continued to smear the Arab countries' communist parties and socialist countries with the anti-Soviet and anti-communist clichés often used by imperialists. He said, "We oppose the movement of communist agents in order to protect our country and keep it free from the encroachment of new colonialism."

Ignoring the Soviet Union's consistent friendship toward the people of the United Arab Republic, Nasser sowed discord by saying, "We have always accepted the Soviet Union's assistance to our Republic, but we cannot accept its support for a group of people whose attitude is contrary to the Arab people's united struggle for independence, staying out of spheres of influence, and refusing subordination. Mr. Khrushchev's support for the communists in our country is a contempt for the will of the Arab people."

Nasser denied Khrushchev's statement that President Nasser insisted on the merger of Iraq and the United Arab Republic.

Prior to this, after the Iraqi government suppressed the Shawwaf rebellion, Nasser delivered five speeches in Damascus from the 11th to the 15th, attacking Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem and the Iraqi Communist Party.

On the 15th, while addressing a group of Lebanese Arabs, Nasser described Shawwaf's rebellious action, which aimed to overthrow the Iraqi government and merge Iraq into the United Arab Republic, as a "revolution" "against terror, injustice, and aggression." He even openly said that as long as the current "terror" in Iraq exists, "the Mosul revolution will not be the last revolution."

    就赫鲁晓夫讲话发表谈话
    纳赛尔续弹反共滥调
    新华社大马士革17日电　纳赛尔总统16日深夜在特别接见中东通讯社记者时，评论赫鲁晓夫在招待伊拉克政府代表团的招待会上发表的讲话说，“赫鲁晓夫先生为我国共产党人进行的辩护是不能为阿拉伯人民接受的。”他硬说，“帮助我国共产党人并为他们辩护”，“意味着蔑视我们共和国人民的一致”。
    纳赛尔在提到赫鲁晓夫指出纳赛尔在“谈到共产主义和共产党人时，他用帝国主义者的语言来武装自己”这句话时，继续用帝国主义者常用的反苏反共的滥调污蔑阿拉伯国家共产党和社会主义国家。他说，“我们反对共产主义代理人的运动是为了保护我国，使它免于新殖民主义的侵犯”。
    纳赛尔不顾苏联对阿联人民的一贯友谊而进行挑拨说，“我们向来接受苏联对我们共和国的帮助，但是我们不能接受它对一部分人的支持，这部分人与阿拉伯人民一致为争取独立和呆在势力范围以外并且拒绝从属地位而进行斗争的态度是相左的。赫鲁晓夫先生支持我国共产党人是蔑视阿拉伯人民的意愿。”
    纳赛尔否认赫鲁晓夫所说的这个事实，即纳赛尔总统坚持伊拉克和阿联的合并。
    在这以前，纳赛尔在伊拉克政府镇压沙瓦夫叛乱以后，从11日至15日的五天中，连续在大马士革发表了五篇攻击伊拉克总理卡塞姆和伊拉克共产党的演说。
    纳赛尔15日在向一批黎巴嫩阿拉伯人发表演说时，把图谋推翻伊拉克政府并使伊拉克并入阿联的沙瓦夫的叛乱行动说成是“反对恐怖、不正义和侵略”的“革命”。他甚至公然地说，只要伊拉克现在的“恐怖”还存在，“摩苏尔的革命将不是最后的革命”。
