Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd. The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee convened a telephone conference of the industrial secretaries of local area and city committees on the 20th. Based on the spirit of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," the conference arranged the province's steel production tasks for the second quarter in advance.

The second quarter is the busiest season for agricultural production and the season with the most rainfall throughout the year. The conference required all localities to earnestly prepare for steel production in the second quarter in advance, while striving to comprehensively fulfill the production plan for the first quarter. The conference pointed out that since the national high-yield, high-quality steelworker competition broadcast conference on the 16th, the output and quality of pig iron and steel in Sichuan Province have improved rapidly. Several areas such as Dachuan and Luzhou have already completed the pig iron production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule; Chongqing's daily steel output has increased significantly. However, the daily output of steel has not increased rapidly. Therefore, in addition to not relaxing the production of pig iron, steel, especially ore and coking coal, all localities must focus on steel production and resolutely increase the daily production level of steel in the short term, in order to lay a better foundation for production in the second quarter.

According to the national plan, Sichuan Province's steel production will increase more each quarter this year. The conference believes that in order to comprehensively fulfill this year's steel production plan, we should grasp tightly from beginning to end, especially at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter. Extend furnace life; all small converters that can produce normally in various places must be started up quickly. The basic construction and equipment supporting work of key steel plants must also be accelerated.

In order to ensure the supply of more high-quality iron for steelmaking to key steel plants in Chongqing, Chengdu and other places, the conference particularly emphasized the need to further increase the output and quality of iron. In addition to paying attention to improving the quality of iron produced by indigenous blast furnaces, we must focus on earnestly grasping the production and construction of foreign blast furnaces. All foreign blast furnaces that have been put into production must strive to increase the utilization coefficient to above 0.7 in the short term; foreign blast furnaces under construction must quickly solve the problems of equipment matching and technical worker training, and strive to put them into production as soon as possible. Around each furnace group, better iron ore and coal resources should be selected, and the construction of ore, coal, and coking bases should be started quickly, and all bases should be built in the second quarter in order to fundamentally get rid of the passive situation of insufficient ore and fuel supply.

In terms of pig iron transportation, the conference required all localities to establish professional iron transportation teams, fix manpower, solve problems in short-distance collection and transportation, and ensure that 80% of foreign iron and 85% of low-sulfur gray iron are transferred out, and strive to enable key steel plants to obtain enough pig iron reserves for one week of steelmaking before the end of March.

    四川安排二季度钢铁生产
    据新华社重庆22日电　中共四川省委20日召开各地委、市委工业书记电话会议，根据“一开头就要抓紧，自始至终抓紧”的精神，提前布置了第二季度全省钢铁生产任务。
    第二季度是农业生产最忙和全年雨量最多的季节，会议要求各地在力争全面完成第一季度生产计划的同时，要提前认真作好第二季度钢铁生产的准备工作。会议指出，16日全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会以后，四川省的生铁和钢材的产量、质量提高得很快，达县、沪州等几个专区已经提前完成第一季度生铁生产计划；重庆钢材日产量有很大增长。但是，钢的日产量提高不快。因此，各地在不放松生铁、钢材，特别是矿石、煤焦等生产以外，还要侧重抓钢，坚决在短期内把钢的日产水平增长上去，为第二季度的生产打下更好的底子。
    按照国家计划，四川省今年钢铁生产增长幅度一个季度比一个季度大，会议认为：要全面完成今年的钢铁生产计划，应当自始至终抓紧，特别要抓紧第一季度的末尾和第二季度的开头。延长炉子寿命；各地凡能正常生产的小转炉，都要迅速开动起来。重点钢厂的基本建设和设备的配套工作也要加快。
    为了保证供应重庆、成都等地重点钢厂更多的炼钢好铁，会议特别强调要进一步大力提高铁的产量和质量。除了注意提高土高炉产铁的质量以外，要着重认真抓好洋高炉的生产建设。凡是已经投入生产的洋高炉，必须争取在短期内把利用系数提高到零点七以上；正在建设的洋高炉，要迅速解决设备配套和技术工人的培训等问题，争取尽快投入生产。在各个炉群周围，要选择较好的铁矿、煤矿资源，迅速着手建立矿石、煤炭、炼焦基地，在第二季度内全部把基地建起来，以便从根本上摆脱矿石、燃料供应不足的被动局面。
    在生铁调运方面，会议要求各地建立专业的运铁队伍，固定人力，解决短途集运中的问题，保证有80％的洋铁和85％的低硫灰口铁外调，争取在3月底以前使各重点钢厂得到足够一周炼钢所需的生铁储备。
