    No Wheat in Hand, Management Will Not Cease
    Shucheng Criticizes Settled Thinking, Strengthens Wheat Field Management
    Pidong Commune Carefully Manages, Striving for a Bumper Wheat Harvest
    (Our Dispatch) Anhui's Shucheng County, through great debate, great inspection, great appraisal, and great competition, has overcome laxity and complacency in wheat field management, eradicated "settled outcome" theories, and is deepening wheat field management step by step.
    Shucheng County's 190,000 mu of wheat and barley are generally growing well. Currently, the main roots are generally over a foot deep, each plant has three to four tillers, and there are 300,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu, with an estimated yield of 1,000 jin per mu.
    Because the wheat is growing well, a sense of laxity and complacency arose among some cadres and the masses, leading to a "settled outcome" mentality of sitting and waiting for a bumper harvest. In response to this thinking, the Shucheng County Party Committee launched a top-down great airing of views and great debate. The debate focused on: Is the wheat harvest a "settled outcome"? Can we afford to be complacent and lax? Can we sit and wait for a bumper harvest? Shen Xingfu, the captain of the Dashu Production Team in Luzhen Commune, used facts in the debate to make a comparison: Last year, this team had a 0.5 mu plot that grew very well initially, but was not managed in the later stages; another 0.7 mu plot grew poorly initially, but was fertilized twice with manure and once with wood ash after the jointing stage; at harvest time, the 0.5 mu plot only yielded 150 jin of wheat, while the 0.7 mu plot yielded 880 jin. Many people said that wheat has to pass "five barriers," and we have only passed "two," so how can we sit and wait for a bumper harvest? The great debate eradicated the idea that the wheat harvest was already "settled" for some people. Now, "No wheat in hand, management will not cease!" has become the action slogan of the vast majority of the county's masses.
    The county convened an on-site meeting to promote wheat management, organized visits, and further swept away complacency and laxity by inspecting and appraising each plot of land. The entire county has already assessed each plot of land according to the wheat seedlings' growth, determined management methods for each plot, and is inspecting, appraising, and mobilizing simultaneously, supplementing what is lacking and accepting each task as it is completed. The first step is to apply fertilizer and weed according to the seedlings' condition to promote strong seedlings. Between Grain Rain and Beginning of Summer, during the flowering and grain-filling stage of wheat, foliar application of phosphate fertilizer will be widely carried out to promote strong stalks and plump grains. Secondly, we must do a good job in preventing disease, pests, waterlogging, late frost, and lodging. Each commune has carried out red flag competitions between teams based on these measures to win this year's bumper harvest.
    In order to ensure that the measures for late-stage wheat field management are resolutely implemented, the Shucheng County Party Committee decided that the county and commune first secretaries will personally grasp wheat field management, and eight county committee members will be responsible for different areas. At the same time, all localities have rectified the organization of field management professional teams and strengthened their capabilities. The County Party Committee has also transferred cadres from county-level agencies to go deep into the grassroots, dividing up responsibilities by area, assigning tasks to groups, implementing measures to the fields, ensuring that every road has a commander, every area has a general, every field has soldiers, and everyone is responsible, leaving no plot unattended and ensuring a bumper harvest in every mu.

    (Our Dispatch) The Pidong People's Commune in Liu'an County, Anhui, is striving for a yield of 4,000 jin per mu on its 3,500 mu of high-yield wheat fields. This large area of high-yield fields achieved an all-round bumper harvest last year and has become a red flag in Anhui Province for high wheat yields.
    This year, the wheat in this high-yield field has been cultivated like a garden, with the addition of the Nanda 2419 improved variety. The wheat fields have generally been deeply plowed to a depth of over one chi, with over 1,500 dan of base fertilizer and the use of wide-strip sowing. To date, the high-yield fields have been top-dressed, weeded, and ridged three times each, with an average of 3,000 dan of soil fertilizer, 1,800 dan of liquid manure, and some chemical fertilizer applied per mu. Currently, the wheat plants are generally six cun tall, with approximately one million seedlings per mu.
    In order to achieve high-yield targets, the Pidong Commune has developed the experience of strengthening late-stage wheat seedling management from last year and formulated a number of practical and feasible measures. The first is to apply fertilizer according to the time, first applying fine soil fertilizer, then quick-acting fertilizer; applying fertilizer according to the weather, applying liquid fertilizer on sunny days, and dry fertilizer on rainy days; applying fertilizer according to the soil, applying sandy fertilizer to sticky soil, and muddy fertilizer to sandy soil; applying fertilizer according to the seedlings, applying more fertilizer to weak seedlings. Based on the wheat seedlings' needs at different stages of growth, quick-acting nitrogen fertilizers such as human and animal manure, and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as wall soil and wood ash are applied separately to increase the number of seedlings and strengthen the wheat stalks.
    The Pidong Commune has also made proper arrangements for the prevention of lodging and wheat rust this year. For wheat seedlings that are growing particularly vigorously, attention is paid to applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, and hemp stalks and wooden sticks have been prepared for supporting the wheat plants to prevent lodging. The commune has also purchased more than 2,000 jin of "666" powder, and more than 300 mu of wheat fields have already been sprayed with a lime-sulfur mixture once. In addition, the work of clearing ditches and draining water has been strengthened to prevent the occurrence of wheat rust.

    小麦不到手　管理不罢休
    舒城批判定局思想加强麦田管理
    淠东公社精心管理争取小麦丰收
    本报讯　安徽舒城县通过大辩论，大检查，大评比，大竞赛，克服了麦田管理的松劲自满思想，破除了“定局论”，使麦田管理步步深入。
    舒城县的十九万亩小麦和大麦，普遍生长良好。目前，一般主根扎有一尺多深，每株有三个到四个分蘖，每亩有苗三十万到八十万株，预计亩产可达千斤。
    由于麦子长得好，在一些干部和群众中产生了松劲自满情绪，产生了坐等丰收的“定局”思想。针对着这种思想，舒城县委自上而下的开展了一场大鸣大放大辩论。辩论内容是：麦子是不是“定局”了？能不能自满松劲？能不能坐等丰收？芦镇公社大树生产队队长沈兴福，在辩论中用事实进行了对比：去年这个队有一丘五分地，原来长的很好，后期就没有管它；另一丘七分地，原来长的差，在拔节后期，连追二次人畜粪，一次草木灰；到收割时，那五分地只收一百五十斤小麦，而那七分地则收获八百八十斤。许多人说，麦子要过“五关”，现在只过了“两关”，怎么能坐等丰收呢？一场大辩论，破除了一些人的小麦已经“定局”的思想。现在，“小麦不到手，管理不罢休！”已成为全县广大群众的行动口号。
    全县召开了小麦管理促进现场会，组织了参观，通过逐丘检查评比，进一步扫清了自满松劲思想。全县已经按照麦苗生长情况，逐丘鉴定，逐丘定出管理办法，并做到边检查、边评比、边发动，缺什么补什么，做一样验收一样。首先是看苗追肥，看苗锄草，促进壮苗。在谷雨和立夏之间，小麦扬花结实阶段，将普遍进行根外喷磷肥，促使秆硬粒饱。其次要做好防病、防虫、防涝、防晚霜、防倒伏。各公社都以这些措施为内容，开展了队和队之间的红旗竞赛，夺取今年的大丰收。
    为了保证麦田后期管理的措施坚决贯彻到底，中共舒城县委决定：由县委和公社第一书记亲自抓麦田管理工作，八个县委委员，分片负责。与此同时，各地还整顿了田间管理专业队的组织，加强了专业队的力量。县委还从县属机关抽调干部，深入基层，划片包干，分工负责，做到任务到组，措施到田，路路有帅，方方有将，田田有兵，人人有责，一亩不漏，亩亩丰收。
    本报讯　安徽六安县淠东人民公社三千五百亩小麦丰产田，力争亩产四千斤。这块大面积丰产田，在去年获得全面丰收，成为安徽省小麦丰产的一面红旗。
    今年这块丰产田的小麦实现了园田化，增加了南大2419良种，麦田普遍深耕一尺以上，基肥一千五百多担，并采用宽幅条播。到目前为止，丰产田已普遍追肥、锄草、整畦各三次，每亩平均追土杂肥三千担，水粪一千八百担和一部分化肥。现在麦棵一般高达六寸，每亩麦苗约在一百万株左右。
    为了实现高产指标，淠东公社发展了去年加强麦苗后期管理的经验，订立了一些切实可行的措施。首先是采取了看时追肥，先追土细肥，后追速效肥；看天追肥，晴天追水肥，雨天追干肥；看土追肥，粘土追沙肥，沙土追泥肥；看苗追肥，弱苗多追肥。并根据麦苗生长阶段需要，分别追人畜粪等速效氮肥和墙灶土、草木灰等磷、钾肥料，使苗株增多，麦茎粗壮。
    淠东公社对今年小麦倒伏和麦锈病的预防工作也作了妥善的安排。对生长特别旺盛的麦苗，注意多施磷、钾肥，并准备了为麦棵搭架用的麻杆和木棍，防止小麦倒伏。公社还购买了“666”药粉二千多斤，目前已有三百多亩麦田洒过一次石灰硫黄合剂。此外还加强了清沟排涝工作，预防麦锈病的发生。
