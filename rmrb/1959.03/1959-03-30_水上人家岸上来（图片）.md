Waterside Dwellers Come Ashore

The waterside dwellers of Guangzhou have successively moved to settle on land, ending the life of living by the water and taking boats as homes for generations over thousands of years.

For many years, the waterside people, who had longed to settle on land, once used the lines "Generation after generation lives by the water, year after year the boat is home; floating and sinking in the waves, life is on the edge of the sea and sky" to reflect their thousands of years of floating life and their desire to change this life.

The work of assisting waterside residents to settle on land began as early as 1956. The Guangzhou Municipal Party and government leading organs and relevant departments attach great importance to this work of improving the living conditions of waterside people. Over the past two years, the Municipal People's Committee has allocated more than 600,000 yuan as construction funds to assist waterside residents in relocating.

Now, fisherman's new villages and boatmen's new villages have been built along the Pearl River in Liwan, Ershatou, Donglang and other places... providing comfortable housing for the waterside people. Recently, with the great leap forward in various production undertakings, waterside residents have basically found employment, and many people have joined state-owned factories and enterprises. The small boats that used to line the banks of the Pearl River as "homes" for waterside residents are decreasing day by day. According to recent statistics, more than 5,000 waterside households have moved ashore, and the remaining 5,000 households will also be relocated this year. The miserable life of waterside residents in the old society is gone forever.

3. The Pearl River Insulating Materials Factory has more than 200 employees who were originally waterside residents. Waterside residents come ashore, not only to live a stable life, but also to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    水上人家岸上来
    广州市的水上人家相继迁移到陆上定居，结束了千百年来世世代代以水为乡、以艇为家的生活。
    多少年来就盼望到陆地定居的水上人民，曾经用“世世水为乡，年年艇作家；浮沉波浪里，生活海天涯”的诗句。反映了他们千百年漂流生活的情景和要求改变这种生活的愿望。
    协助水上居民上陆定居的工作，早在1956年就已经开始了。广州市党政领导机关和各有关部门对这项改善水上人民居住条件的工作很重视。两年来，市人民委员会先后拨款六十多万元，作为协助水上居民迁居的建设费用。
    现在，珠江沿岸荔湾、二沙头、东朗等地都建起了渔民新村、船民新村……给水上人家安排了舒适的住宅。近来，随着各项生产事业大跃进，水上居民已基本就业，许多人参加了国营工厂、企业工作。过去排列在珠江岸边作为水上居民“住宅”的小艇，正在一天天地减少，据最近统计，已经有五千多户水上居民先后迁居陆上，剩下的五千多户今年内也将迁居完毕。水上居民在旧社会里的凄惨生活已一去不返了。

    3珠江绝缘器材厂有二百多个职工是原来的水上居民。水上居民上岸来，不仅生活安定，而且更便于参加祖国各项社会主义建设。这是女工们正在刮胶，制造传动平型胶带。

    5解放后，水上居民的子弟能普遍上学读书。这是珠江水上第四小学的学生们在课外活动。这个学校有一千多名学生是水上居民的子弟。
