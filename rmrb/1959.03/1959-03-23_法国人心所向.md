Editorial: The French People's Aspirations

    On March 8th and 15th, France held the first and second rounds of municipal elections respectively. This was the first time since last September's "referendum" and November's National Assembly elections that the French people had expressed their attitude towards the various political forces in France through a nationwide vote, and it was also a public opinion poll on de Gaulle's "achievements" in recent months.

    As early as May 13th of last year, when the French military insurgents in Algeria fired the first shot to support de Gaulle's rise to power, a fierce struggle between dictatorship and anti-dictatorship unfolded between de Gaulle and his bourgeois right-wing allies on one side, and the French democratic forces led by the French Communist Party on the other. De Gaulle relied on military insurgents and a large-scale deception campaign to spread the illusion among the French people that only he could solve all of France's major problems; this is how he seized power and won the two "voting victories" last year. Immediately after seizing central power, de Gaulle actively prepared to exclude the French Communist Party and other democratic forces from municipal institutions and seize control of all local power. To this end, he formulated municipal election laws aimed at excluding the French Communist Party. The de Gaulle faction's party, the "Union for the Defense of the New Republic," shouted the arrogant slogan of "attacking municipal councils and expelling Communists." The French Communist Party called on the French people to use their votes to show their determination to block the path of personal military dictatorship and fascist adventures. These municipal elections were held in this tense situation.

    These municipal elections have ended with a great victory for the French Communist Party and a severe setback for de Gaulle's plan to seize national municipal councils. Despite the siege of the French Communist Party by de Gaulle's followers and their allies, despite the undemocratic election laws that gave the French Communist Party many votes but few seats, the French Communist Party still won roughly the same number of municipal council seats as in the previous municipal elections, maintained many of the municipal councils it originally led, and gained an advantage in some new municipal councils. In particular, in the suburbs of Paris, which de Gaulle's followers called the "red zone," the offensive of the "Union for the Defense of the New Republic" was defeated. The number of votes received by the French Communist Party in this municipal election increased significantly compared with the parliamentary elections last year, reaching 29.1% of the total votes (the French Communist Party received 19.5% of the total votes in the parliamentary elections last year), which was 300,000 more votes than in 1953, thus strengthening its position as the largest party in France. As for the Union for the Defense of the New Republic, which supported de Gaulle, it lost hundreds of thousands of votes compared with last year's parliamentary elections. In Paris alone, it lost nearly 64,700 votes; according to the total number of votes in major cities with a population of more than 120,000, it fell from 25% last year to 18% in the first round of voting. The political forces that uphold democracy are stubbornly rising under various forms of repression, while the political forces that support dictatorship are significantly declining despite having all the favorable conditions of the ruling party. This vividly reflects the direction of popular sentiment. The "Paris Daily" exclaimed that this was "the voters sounding the alarm," and the Associated Press reported that the fact that many French voters had "returned to the red camp" was "the most amazing result."

    De Gaulle's serious setback in these municipal elections was no accident. It is the inevitable result of his increasingly unpopular policies. Everyone knows that the most fundamental reason for the continuous deterioration of the lives of the French people since World War II lies in the fact that successive French governments have insisted on waging colonial wars and following the United States' path of arms expansion and war preparation, while completely shifting the resulting disastrous consequences to the French people. Since de Gaulle came to power, he has intensified the implementation of this reactionary policy that harms the interests of the French people.

    De Gaulle hoped to solve the Algerian problem by eliminating the Algerian national independence movement. He put forward a plan to help Algeria's economic recovery, sang the hackneyed tune of the "French Community," and tried to disintegrate the will of the Algerian people; at the same time, he increased war spending, transferred troops, and intensified the barbaric colonial war. De Gaulle also hoped to gain political capital and strengthen his domestic rule by "restoring France's status as a major power." He continued to expand armaments, tried his best to develop atomic weapons, and wanted to squeeze into the "atomic club" of major powers. De Gaulle also hoped to rely on opening up a path for French monopoly capital in the international capitalist market to ease the economic recession in France. Therefore, he did not hesitate to abandon the traditional tariff system that protected French industry, accelerated the realization of the "Common Market," and even quenched his thirst with poison by devaluing the franc and making it freely convertible, strengthening the competitiveness of French export commodities and driving Britain out of the Western European continental market. In order to carry out this overwhelming competition, de Gaulle did not hesitate to approach Adenauer in exchange for West Germany's economic support.

    All of this has made the already very difficult French financial and economic situation even worse. The intensification of colonial wars and the expansion of armaments have resulted in a sharp increase in the fiscal deficit, from 600 billion francs last year to more than 1 trillion francs at present. The devaluation of the franc and free convertibility have not achieved much success in improving the competitiveness of export commodities, but have greatly increased the prices of essential imported industrial raw materials, making France's gold and dollar reserves even more depleted, and exacerbating the trend of inflation and soaring prices. In order to make up for the deficit, curb the continued deterioration of the economy, and protect the profits of monopoly capital, the de Gaulle government announced the so-called "economic plan for saving," increasing new taxes, freezing wages, cutting social welfare subsidies, canceling subsidies for agricultural product prices, and increasing the fees for public utilities, etc., launching a fierce attack on the living standards of the French people, taking away 859 billion francs from the income of the working people every year. This cannot but sharpen the class contradictions in France. Recently, the struggles launched by the French working people to meet their own economic demands have become larger and larger. De Gaulle's policies have also led to economic and diplomatic dependence on West Germany, and have entrusted the fate of the French nation to the German militarists who have invaded France three times in 70 years, seriously threatening the security of the French people.

    The facts of the past few months have proved that de Gaulle, the so-called "powerful figure," is completely incapable of solving France's problems, and has also completely exposed that this so-called "super-class supreme arbiter" is precisely the most loyal servant of the French monopoly capital group and the agent of the French colonialist group. De Gaulle's "myth" has begun to shatter. De Gaulle's setback in these municipal elections shows that many people who were deceived by de Gaulle in the past have gradually awakened from their own experience.

    In sharp contrast, the prestige of the French Communist Party has been further enhanced. From the very beginning, the French Communist Party sounded the alarm to the French people, pointing out that de Gaulle's rule would bring disastrous consequences, and repeatedly exposing de Gaulle's hypocrisy and the essence of his policies. The French Communist Party always regards the interests of the French people as its highest interests and has supreme trust in the French people. Even in the days when de Gaulle won the "victory" of the "referendum" and was at the height of his arrogance, the French Communist Party did not lose its trust in the French people, but correctly pointed out: "The masses of the people have learned lessons from their own experience and have been inspired by the French Communist Party... They will soon see through the true nature of de Gaulle's policies." The French Communist Party, under very difficult conditions, united all democratic forces and waged unremitting struggles against de Gaulle's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. With its correct propositions and heroic struggles, the French Communist Party has proved that it is the most loyal defender of the interests of the French people and the most resolute opponent of de Gaulle's dictatorial rule. It is on this basis that thousands of French people responded to the call of the French Communist Party: "Make this (municipal) election a battle to defend democracy and freedom, oppose poverty, and strive for peace." In these municipal elections, not only did many voters who had lost their way re-vote for the French Communist Party, but also a considerable number of people who had never voted for the Communist Party voted in support of the candidates nominated by the French Communist Party.

    It should be especially mentioned here that, at the initiative of the French Communist Party, some local organizations of the French Socialist Party and other bourgeois parties formed an alliance with the French Communist Party, disregarding the orders of their upper-level right-wing leaders, and put forward joint candidate lists in dozens of cities, and achieved important victories. This is a development of great significance, indicating that there has been further differentiation within the Socialist Party and other bourgeois parties. The emergence of such alliances is a reflection of the dissatisfaction of French petty and middle bourgeoisie with de Gaulle's policies that serve the monopoly capital group, and it is also a heavy blow to the likes of Mollet and Guy Mollet who collude with de Gaulle to sell out the interests of French workers. The French bourgeois ruling group, with the support of the right-wing socialist leaders, originally intended to isolate the French Communist Party in the municipal elections, but the result was that those who wanted to isolate others were isolated themselves. The broad masses of working people are uniting more and more closely around the French Communist Party, and even some petty and middle bourgeoisie are increasingly aware that alliance with the French Communist Party is the only way out; the proposition that workers and democratic forces must form an alliance has been more widely deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The left-wing alliance that emerged in these municipal elections is just a beginning. In the future, as de Gaulle's reactionary policies run into more and more snags, the French people's awareness increases, and the alliance uniting all French democratic forces will be widely developed, and will play an increasingly important role on the French political stage.

    Of course, all reactionaries are unwilling to accept defeat. The French reactionary forces represented by de Gaulle will inevitably intensify their attacks on the French democratic forces in an attempt to consolidate their rule, which has already begun to decline. However, the direction of the French people's hearts and the general trend, as shown in these municipal elections, can never be changed by any struggle of the reactionary forces.

    法国人心所向
    3月8日和15日，法国先后举行了第一轮和第二轮投票的市政选举。这是法国人民从去年9月“公民投票”和11月国民议会选举以来，第一次通过全国性的投票来表明他们对法国当前各种政治力量的态度，也是对戴高乐几个月来“政绩”的一次民意测验。
    早从去年5月13日法国军事暴乱分子在阿尔及利亚放出簇拥戴高乐上台的第一枪那一天起，在戴高乐和他的资产阶级右翼联盟者作为一方，同以法国共产党为首的法国民主力量作为另一方之间，就展开了激烈的独裁和反独裁的斗争。戴高乐依靠军事暴乱分子和大规模的欺骗运动，在法国人民群众中散播了所谓唯有他能解决法国的一切重大问题的幻想；这样才攫取了政权和取得了去年的两次“投票胜利”。紧跟在攫取中央政权之后，戴高乐就积极准备把法共和其他民主力量排挤出市政机构，夺取全部地方政权的控制权，为此，制定了目的在排斥法共的市镇选举法。戴高乐分子的政党“保卫新共和联盟”叫出了“向市政委员会进攻，驱逐共产党人”的狂妄口号。法国共产党则号召法国人民用他们的选票来表明堵塞个人军事独裁和法西斯冒险道路的决心。这次市政选举正是在这种激烈斗争的形势下举行的。
    这次市政选举已经以法国共产党取得巨大胜利和戴高乐夺取全国市政委员会的计划遭受严重挫折而告结束。尽管戴高乐分子和他们的联盟者向法共实行围攻，尽管不民主的选举法使法共得票多而席位少，法共仍然获得了和上届市政选举时大体相当的市政委员的席位，保持了许多原来由它领导的市政委员会，并且在新的一些市政委员会中取得了优势。特别是在戴高乐分子称为“红色地带”的巴黎郊区，打败了“保卫新共和联盟”的进攻。法共在这次市政选举所得票数比去年议会选举时大有增长，获得总票数的29.1％（去年议会选举时法共得票占总数的19.5％），比1953年还多了三十万张，这样就加强了它作为法国第一大党的地位。至于支持戴高乐的保卫新共和联盟比起去年的议会选举来，丧失了几十万张选票，仅仅在巴黎一地，就减少了近六万四千七百票；根据人口超过十二万人的各大城市的选票总计，从去年的25％降到第一轮投票中的18％。维护民主的政治力量在种种受压制的情况下顽强地上升，而支持独裁的政治力量则尽管拥有执政者的一切有利条件仍然显著地下降。这鲜明地反映了人心的向背。“巴黎日报”惊呼这是“选民们拉了警铃”，美联社报道说，许多法国选民“回到红色的队伍中”是“最惊人的结果”。
    戴高乐在这次市政选举中遭受严重的挫折，并不是偶然的。这是他的政策日益不得人心的必然结果。谁都知道，造成第二次世界大战以后法国人民生活不断恶化的最根本原因在于：历届法国政府坚持进行殖民战争，追随美国的扩军备战道路，却又把由此而来的灾难性后果完全转嫁于法国人民。戴高乐上台以来，变本加厉地执行了这种危害法国人民利益的反动政策。
    戴高乐指望以消灭阿尔及利亚民族独立运动，来解决阿尔及利亚问题。他提出什么帮助阿尔及利亚经济复兴的计划，高唱“法兰西共同体”的滥调，来瓦解阿尔及利亚人民的斗志；与此同时，增拨战费、调兵遣将，加紧进行野蛮的殖民战争。戴高乐又指望从“恢复法国的大国地位”，来捞取政治资本，加强自己对国内的统治地位。他继续扩张军备，竭力发展原子武器，要挤进大国的“原子俱乐部”。戴高乐还指望依靠在国际资本主义市场上，为法国垄断资本打开一条出路，以缓和法国国内的经济衰退。因此，他不惜放弃传统的保护法国工业的关税制度，加速实现“共同市场”，甚至饮鸩止渴地实行法郎贬值和自由兑换，加强法国出口商品的竞争能力，把英国赶出西欧大陆市场。而为了进行这场力不胜任的竞争，戴高乐不惜靠拢阿登纳，换取西德的经济支持。
    所有这一切，使得原来已经十分困难的法国财政经济状况更加恶化。加紧殖民战争和扩张军备的结果是财政赤字急剧增加，从去年的六千亿法郎增至目前的一万亿法郎以上。法郎贬值和自由兑换在提高出口商品的竞争能力方面未见多大成效，倒是使得必需的进口工业原料价格大大提高，法国的黄金美元储备更加空匮，加剧了通货膨胀的趋势，物价飞涨。为了弥补赤字，制止经济的继续恶化，保障垄断资本的利润，戴高乐政府宣布了所谓“节约的经济计划”，增加新税、冻结工资、削减社会福利补贴、取消对农产品价格的补贴，提高公用事业的收费等等，向法国人民的生活水平发动了凶猛的进攻，每年从劳动人民的收入中夺去了八千五百九十亿法郎。这就不能不使法国国内阶级矛盾尖锐化起来。最近，法国劳动人民为满足自身经济要求而开展的斗争，规模越来越大。戴高乐的政策也导致了在经济上和外交上依附西德，把法兰西民族的命运交给在七十年中三次侵入法国的德国军国主义者之手，使法国人民的安全受到严重的威胁。
    几个月来的事实，证明了戴高乐这个所谓“强有力的人物”完全无能解决法国的问题，也完全暴露了这个所谓“超阶级的最高仲裁者”正是法国垄断资本集团最忠实的仆人，法国殖民主义集团的代理人。戴高乐的“神话”开始破灭了。戴高乐在这次市政选举中所遭受的挫折，正是表明了不少过去为戴高乐所欺骗的人，已经从亲身的经验中，逐渐清醒起来。
    成为鲜明对照的，是法国共产党的威信进一步提高了。从一开始，法国共产党就向法国人民敲起警钟，指出戴高乐的统治将带来灾难性后果，并反复揭露戴高乐的虚伪面目和他的政策的实质。法国共产党始终以法国人民的利益为自己的最高利益，对法国人民有着无上的信任。即使在戴高乐取得“公民投票”的“胜利”而气焰万丈的日子里，法共也没有丧失它对法国人民的信任，而是正确地指出：“人民群众从自己的经验中吸取了教训，并受到法国共产党的启发……他们不久就会识破戴高乐政策的真正性质”。法国共产党在十分困难的条件下，团结一切民主力量，向戴高乐的对内对外的反动政策进行不懈的斗争。法国共产党以自己的正确的主张和英勇的斗争，证明了自己是法国人民利益的最忠实捍卫者，是戴高乐专制统治的最坚决的反对者。正是在这样的基础上，成千上万的法国人民响应了法国共产党的号召：“使这次（市政）选举成为保卫民主和自由、反对贫困、争取和平的战斗”。在这次市政选举中，不但有许多曾经迷失方向的选民重新投了法共的票，而且有为数不少的从来不投共产党的票的人，也投票支持法共提名的候选人了。
    这里特别应该提到，在法国共产党的倡议下，法国社会党和其他资产阶级政党的一些地方组织，不顾它们的上层右翼领导的命令而同法共结成了联盟，在几十个城市里提出了联合候选名单，并且取得了重要的胜利。这是具有重要意义的发展，表明在社会党和其他资产阶级政党内部有了进一步的分化。出现这样的联盟，是法国中小资产阶级分子对戴高乐的为垄断资本集团服务的政策不满的反映，也是对勾结戴高乐出卖法国工人利益的摩勒、盖伊阿之流的沉重打击。法国资产阶级统治集团在右翼社会党首脑的支持之下，原来打算在市政选举中孤立法国共产党，结果却是想孤立别人的人，自己倒是陷于孤立了。广大劳动人民越来越紧密地团结在法共的周围，甚至连一部分中小资产阶级者也日益醒悟到只有和法共联盟才是出路；工人和民主力量必须结成联盟的主张，已经更加广泛地深入人心。这次市政选举中出现的左翼联盟仅仅是一个开端。今后，随着戴高乐的反动政策日益碰壁，法国人民的觉悟日益提高，团结着法国一切民主力量的联盟将会得到广泛的发展，而在法国政治舞台上将起日益重要的作用。
    当然，一切反动派都是不甘心于失败的。以戴高乐为代表的法国反动势力必将加紧向法国民主力量进攻，以图巩固其目前已经开始走下坡路的统治局面。但是，在这次市政选举中所表明的法国人心所向，大势所趋，决不是反动势力的任何挣扎所能改变的。
