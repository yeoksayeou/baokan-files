Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 16th: Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, are striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year, and their spring planting preparations are basically complete. Spring plowing has already begun in some areas of southern Xinjiang and the Turpan Basin, where it is warmer earlier.

The common characteristics of this year's spring planting preparations in various parts of Xinjiang are: early start, rapid progress, and great achievements. Since last winter, farmers of all ethnic groups throughout the region have comprehensively launched spring planting preparations, centering on manure accumulation, starting more than a month earlier than in previous years. As of the end of February, the entire autonomous region had accumulated 667.1 billion jin of manure, completing 66.7% of the annual manure accumulation task, more than twice the total amount of manure accumulated in the autonomous region last year and the year before. In addition to preparing enough topdressing fertilizer for winter wheat, an average of 20,000 jin of manure was accumulated for each mu of spring-sown crops. In Turpan County, measures such as high-temperature composting and collecting human urine were adopted to improve the quality of fertilizer. By the end of February, the county had accumulated an average of 30,000 jin of manure per mu. While vigorously carrying out the manure accumulation campaign, various localities also established more than 6,000 small local chemical fertilizer plants and some bacterial fertilizer plants, producing 51.5 billion jin of local chemical fertilizer.

During the spring planting preparations, winter water conservancy projects were widely carried out in various places. According to recent statistics, the region has completed 42.45 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, increasing the irrigated area by 1.65 million mu and improving the irrigated area by 5.44 million mu. Many areas in southern Xinjiang, in response to the water shortage in spring in previous years, have carried out winter irrigation on most wheat fields.

In terms of seeds, most of the various seeds required for spring sowing in the region have now been adequately prepared. The region's major crops are planning to basically achieve the use of improved varieties this year. As of recently, the region has manufactured, improved, and promoted 572 types of new agricultural implements, totaling 250,000 pieces; commercial departments at all levels have transferred more than 9,000 deep plows and seeders, 331 tractors, and nearly 2,000 pieces of various machinery, and 4,620 tons of chemical fertilizer to rural areas.

In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are currently universally carrying out a large-scale production labor competition to ensure the realization of increased production targets. The wheat 1,000 jin bumper harvest competition initiated by Yengisar County has been enthusiastically launched between Yanqi, Shawan and other counties.

This newspaper, Urumqi, March 18th: Yengisar County, which overcame various natural disasters and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture in the Great Leap Forward last year, recently raised its original plan of 400 jin of wheat per mu to 1,000 jin, striving to achieve a wheat 1,000 jin county, and used this to propose a friendly competition to all counties in the region.

Before proposing the target of striving to become a wheat 1,000 jin county, the Yengisar County Party Committee conducted a detailed inspection and analysis of the growth and management of winter wheat throughout the county: a total of 145,000 mu of winter wheat were planted in the county. Due to the universal deep plowing, close planting, application of base fertilizer, and adoption of improved varieties by all communes during sowing last year; and the intensive winter management work since the beginning of winter: all wheat fields were winter-irrigated, universally covered with fertilized soil, harrowed two to three times, and most wheat fields were fertilized with nearly 10,000 jin of fine fertilizer. Therefore, the wheat fields were generally loose and moist, the wheat roots were well-established, and the growth was very vigorous, all of which created favorable conditions for a bumper wheat harvest this year.

Based on the investigation and analysis, the Yengisar County Party Committee recently convened a symposium of Party Committee secretaries, presidents, and commune cadres of various communes to discuss the issue of whether wheat can achieve a large increase in production. At the meeting, everyone put forward many favorable conditions that could be used to strive for a bumper wheat harvest. First of all, since the communes vigorously carried out the manure accumulation campaign last winter and this spring, each mu of wheat field has now accumulated an average of more than 32,000 jin of fine fertilizer; in terms of water conservancy, due to the vigorous water conservancy campaign last year, the county has built two large canals and two large reservoirs. In addition, the various water conservancy projects currently underway can completely guarantee sufficient water for all wheat fields; especially under the inspiration of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year, the people of the county are full of energy. Everyone believed that the above conditions are the material basis for realizing a wheat 1,000 jin county and unanimously agreed to raise the original target of 400 jin per mu to 1,000 jin.

The meeting also conducted a detailed discussion on the current and complete wheat field management work and put forward many specific measures: First, to muster greater revolutionary energy, adhere to putting politics in command, and the first secretaries of the county and commune party committees should grasp the management of wheat fields, resolutely implement the method of contracting responsibility at all levels, so that this work can be carried out thoroughly and ensure the implementation of various measures. Second, hold high the red flag of the wheat 1,000 jin bumper harvest campaign, and continuously carry out extensive publicity and mobilization work among the masses, and set off a continuous upsurge of appraisal and competition. Third, resolutely ensure that general wheat fields are topdressed with 30,000 jin of fertilizer again, and high-yield fields are topdressed with 100,000 jin. In terms of the method of applying topdressing fertilizer, slow-release fertilizer should be applied first, followed by fast-acting fertilizer; and it should be evenly distributed. Fourth, let the wheat fields drink enough water, ensuring that they are irrigated whenever they are short of water, with less frequent and more frequent irrigation. General wheat fields should be irrigated four more times, and high-yield fields should be irrigated six times. Fifth, continue to do a good job in the file management of winter wheat, and make every effort to manage the county's 10,000 mu of high-yield fields producing 5,000 jin and 50,000 mu of double 1,000 jin wheat fields, in order to gain experience to drive the production of other wheat fields. In order to thoroughly realize the above work, in addition to establishing winter wheat professional teams (groups), each commune must also establish a winter wheat field command post to implement unified command. Sixth, continue to do a good job in harrowing to preserve soil moisture, and all winter wheat must be harrowed once before returning to green, and weeding must be done well to ensure that the soil is loose and there are no weeds on the ground. Seventh, strictly prevent diseases, pests, frost damage, and trampling by humans and animals. Each team should organize a wheat protection group to strengthen prediction and forecasting, so as to prevent diseases and insects, and to eliminate all diseases and insects.

Currently, Yengisar County has launched a vigorous wheat bumper harvest competition climax between communes, teams, and groups. In order to strengthen leadership, the County Party Committee has transferred 39 of the 65 county, department, and section-level cadres from the entire county to the production brigades of various communes to specifically lead this work. Under the slogan of striving to achieve a wheat 1,000 jin county, the county plans to sow 15,000 mu of spring wheat, and the sowing has started half a month earlier than in previous years.

    新疆备耕工作又早又好
    英吉沙县摆下小麦千斤擂台，全区掀起竞赛高潮
    据新华社乌鲁木齐16日　电  新疆天山南北各族农民力争今年农业全面大丰收的备耕工作已经基本就绪。早暖的南疆部分地区和吐鲁番盆地已开始春耕。
    今年新疆各地备耕工作的共同特点是：动手早、进展快、成绩大。从去冬以来，全疆各族农民就以积肥工作为中心，全面地展开了备耕工作，较往年早动手一个多月。截至2月底，全自治区已积肥六千六百七十一亿斤，完成了全年积肥任务的66.7％，超过自治区去年和前年积肥总数的二倍多。除准备了足够的冬麦所需追肥外，平均为每亩春播作物积肥二万斤。吐鲁番县在积肥中，采取了高温堆肥、收集人尿等办法，提高肥料的质量，到2月底全县平均已为每亩地积肥三万斤。各地在大搞积肥运动的同时，还建立了六千多座小型土化肥厂和一些细菌肥料厂，制造土化肥五百一十五亿斤。
    在备耕中，各地普遍进行了冬修水利工作。据最近统计，全区已完成土石方工程四千二百四十五万立方，增加灌溉面积一百六十五万亩，改善灌溉面积五百四十四万亩。南疆许多地区针对当地历年春季缺水的情况，对大部分麦田都进行了冬灌。
    在种子方面，目前全区春播所需的各种种籽，绝大部分已准备充足。全区主要作物都准备在今年基本实现良种化。截至最近为止，全区已制造、改良和推广各种新式农具五百七十二种、二十五万件；各级商业部门为各地农村调运了各种深耕犁和播种机九千多部，拖拉机三百三十一台，各种机械近二千件，化肥四千六百二十吨。
    为争取今年更大的丰收，自治区各族农民目前正在普遍地开展保证实现增产指标的生产劳动大竞赛。由英吉沙县发起的小麦千斤丰产竞赛运动，已在焉耆、沙湾等县之间热烈展开。
    本报乌鲁木齐18日电　去年在大跃进中战胜各种自然灾害、获得了农业全面大丰收的英吉沙县，最近把原订亩产小麦四百斤的计划提高到一千斤，力争实现小麦千斤县，并以此向全区各县提出了友谊竞赛。
    英吉沙县在提出力争小麦千斤县的指标前，县委曾对全县的冬麦生长情况和管理工作进行了详细的检查和分析：全县共种冬麦十四万五千亩，由于去年播种时各公社普遍进行了深耕、密植，施了底肥和采用了良种；入冬以来又大抓了越冬管理工作：所有麦田全部进行了冬灌，普遍上了肥田土，耙磨了二至三次，大部分麦田施了近万斤细肥，因此麦田普遍松软湿润，麦田扎根好、生长得非常健壮，这些都为今年小麦大丰收创造了有利条件。
    在调查和分析的基础上，英吉沙县委在最近召开了各公社党委书记、社长、社干部座谈会，对小麦能否大增产的问题进行了讨论。会上大家又提出了许多能够争取小麦大丰收的有利条件，首先是去冬今春公社大搞积肥运动以来，目前每亩麦田平均已积了三万二千多斤细肥；水利方面由于去年大搞了水利运动，全县已修好两个大渠和两个大水库，再加上目前正在进行的各项水利工程，完全可以保证全部麦田有充足的用水；尤其是全县人民在去年大跃进成绩的鼓舞下，干劲十足。大家认为上述种种条件是实现小麦千斤县的物质基础，一致同意把原订单产四百斤的指标提高到一千斤。
    会议对目前以及全部麦田管理工作还作了细致的讨论，提出了许多具体措施：一是鼓足更大的革命干劲，坚持政治挂帅，县和公社党委第一书记，都抓麦田管理工作，坚决贯彻层层包干负责的办法，使这一工作一竿子插到底，保证各项措施的实现。二、高举小麦千斤丰产运动的红旗，不断在群众中广泛地进行宣传鼓动工作，掀起不断的评比竞赛热潮。三、坚决作到一般麦田再次施追肥三万斤，高额丰产田追肥十万斤。在施追肥的方法上，要先施迟效肥，后施速效肥；并要撒布均匀。四、让麦田喝饱喝足，作到随缺随灌，少灌勤灌，一般麦田再灌四次水，高额丰产田灌六次水。五、继续作好冬麦档案管理工作，全力管好全县一万亩产五千斤的高额丰产田和五万亩双千斤麦田，以取得经验带动其他麦田的生产。为了使上述工作彻底实现，各公社除成立冬麦专业队（组）外，还要建立冬麦田间指挥部，实行统一指挥。六、继续作好耙磨保墒工作，所有冬麦在返青前还要耙磨一次，作好锄草工作，保证土壤疏松，地无杂草。七、严防病、虫、冻害和人畜践踏，各队都要组织护麦小组，以加强预测预报，作到无病虫预防，有病虫全部消灭。
    目前，英吉沙县已掀起了轰轰烈烈社与社、队与队、组与组之间的小麦丰产竞赛高潮。县委为了加强领导，已从全县六十五名县、部、科长级干部中抽调出三十九名，分配到各公社生产大队，具体领导这一工作。全县计划播种的一万五千亩春麦，在争取实现小麦千斤县的口号下，已较往年提前半个月开始播种。（丁文）
