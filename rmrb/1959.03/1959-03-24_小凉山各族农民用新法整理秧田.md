Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 23rd: Farmers of various ethnic groups in the Lesser Liang Mountains, Yunnan, have learned to use new methods to prepare rice seedling fields and carry out spring planting.

The Ninglang Yi Autonomous County in the Lesser Liang Mountains is inhabited by several ethnic groups, including Yi, Naxi, and Lisu. In the past, they practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, and the area devoted to rice was small. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the total grain output of the county increased by more than double that of 1957. However, because farmers of various ethnic groups were not skilled in rice cultivation techniques, the yield per unit area was still relatively low. This year, the county has carefully summarized its experiences from last year, formulated a larger Great Leap Forward plan, and expanded the rice area to 71,000 mu, of which 14,200 mu are designated as high-yield fields. Since this spring, the county has sent more than 300 cadres to rural areas to help farmers of various ethnic groups learn rice cultivation techniques.

Now, farmers of all ethnic groups have learned the techniques of plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and raising small seedlings. Plowing and deep digging of paddy fields have reached 1.2 chi (approximately 1.3 feet), achieving insect-free and weed-free conditions. The amount of base fertilizer in seedling fields has generally reached over 100,000 jin (approximately 50 tons) per mu, and attention is paid to applying more potash-rich fertilizers such as grass ash to ensure strong seedling growth. Seed selection generally involves mud-water selection, warm water soaking, or Ceresan seed treatment, and the time for sowing seedlings has been moved up by one solar term compared to last year. Currently, preparations are underway to open rice transplanting training classes in batches, by area, to train a large number of skilled rice transplanters.

    小凉山各族农民用新法整理秧田
    据新华社昆明23日电　云南小凉山的各族农民学会用新法整理秧田和进行春播。
    小凉山宁蒗彝族自治县境内居住着彝、纳西、傈僳等几个民族，过去是刀耕火种，水稻面积很少。在去年大跃进中，全县粮食总产量比1957年增产一倍多。但由于各族农民种水稻的技术不熟练，单位面积产量还比较低。今年，全县认真总结了去年的经验，订出了更大的跃进计划，把水稻面积扩大到七万一千亩，其中有一万四千二百亩定为丰产田。今春以来，全县派出三百多名干部到农村，帮助各族农民学会种水稻的技术。
    现在，各族农民都学会了犁田、积肥和培育小秧的技术。水田深挖深犁达到一尺二寸，做到无虫无草，秧田底肥数量普遍达到每亩十万斤以上，并注意多施草木灰等含钾素较多的肥料，使秧田植棵健壮。种子普遍做到泥水选种、温汤浸种或赛力散拌种，撒秧时间比去年提早了一个节令。目前正在准备分片分批开办栽秧训练班，训练大批栽秧能手。
