Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 19th: The Chinese Communist Party and government delegation, headed by Vice Chairman Zhu De, arrived in Budapest on the 19th. The delegation was invited by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government to participate in the 40th anniversary commemoration of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Members of the delegation include Xi Zhongxun, member of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary-General of the State Council, and Hao Deqing, Chinese Ambassador to Hungary.

Those who welcomed the delegation at the airport included: Munnich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government; Marosan György, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Party Central Committee; Apro Antal, member of the Political Bureau and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government; Ronai Sándor, member of the Political Bureau and Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly; and members of the Political Bureau, Kisz, Fock, Biszku, Somogyi; alternate member of the Political Bureau, Nemes; as well as Hungarian Foreign Minister Sik and Defense Minister Révész.

Prime Minister Munnich and Vice Chairman Zhu De spoke at the airport successively.

In his welcoming speech, Prime Minister Munnich said that when the Hungarian working class first seized power forty years ago, the international situation was still favorable to the counter-revolution. At that time, reactionary forces at home and abroad united and were able to temporarily defeat the young, inexperienced proletarian state. However, the tide of history cannot be stopped. Over the past forty years, the world situation has undergone fundamental changes. Today, the Soviet Union has become one of the most powerful countries in the world, and socialism has achieved complete victory in China and other countries of the socialist camp. The countries of the socialist camp are developing rapidly at an unprecedented speed. After crushing the counter-revolutionary rebellion of 1956, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, are now building a better future at an even faster pace.

Munnich pointed out that two and a half years ago, when the Hungarian people were in difficult times, the heroic Chinese people gave them great help, and the Hungarian people will never forget this.

Munnich said that for the sake of common ideals, we must now and in the future strive to develop the relations between Hungary and China and help and learn from each other on the basis of proletarian internationalism. The selfless drive, simplicity, and self-sacrificing heroism of the great Chinese people will always be the example we follow.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said in his speech that on the occasion of the upcoming 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, our Chinese Communist Party and government delegation is honored and pleased to be invited by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government to come to your beautiful country and commemorate this glorious festival with you. We sincerely thank you for your warm and friendly welcome.

I am particularly happy to have the opportunity to visit Hungary for the second time. When I first visited your country in January 1956, the great achievements of Hungary's socialist construction, its beautiful and rich land, its hardworking and courageous people, and their brotherly friendship with the Chinese people left me with an indelible impression. Since then, the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in China and Hungary, and the deep friendship between our two countries, have developed anew. I believe that our visit to your country this time to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and to meet with the Hungarian party and government leaders and the Hungarian people, will surely help to further strengthen the close unity and friendly cooperation between our two peoples.

Vice Chairman Zhu De finally said that under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the Hungarian people have carried out struggles and work effectively, and have made significant achievements in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, defending socialist achievements, and carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction. The Chinese people are greatly delighted and encouraged by the achievements of the Hungarian people, and sincerely wish the Hungarian people continued new and brilliant victories on the road to building socialism!

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 19th: Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China and head of the party and government delegation invited to attend the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, left Warsaw by plane for Budapest at 9:30 this morning.

    应邀参加匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年庆祝典礼
    朱德副主席率代表团到布达佩斯
    新华社布达佩斯19日电  以朱德副主席为首的中国共产党和
  中国政府代表团19日到达布达佩斯。代表团是应匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的邀请前来参加匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年纪念的。代表团团员有中共中央委员、国务院秘书长习仲勋和中国驻匈牙利大使郝德青。
    到机场欢迎代表团的有：社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫，政治局委员、党中央书记处书记马罗山，政治局委员、工农革命政府第一副总理奥普罗，政治局委员、匈牙利国民议会议长罗奈伊，政治局委员基什、福克、比斯库、绍莫吉，政治局候补委员内梅什以及匈牙利外交部长西克和国防部长雷维斯。
    明尼赫总理和朱德副主席先后在机场上讲了话。
    明尼赫总理在致欢迎词时说，当四十年前匈牙利工人阶级第一次取得政权时，国际形势还有利于反革命。当时，国内外的反动势力联合起来还能够暂时击败年轻的、毫无经验的无产阶级国家。但是，历史的潮流是阻挡不住的。四十年来，世界局势已经发生了根本的变化。今天，苏联成了世界上最强大的国家之一，社会主义在中国及社会主义阵营其他国家里也取得了彻底的胜利。社会主义阵营各国正在以史无前例的速度迅速发展着。匈牙利人民在粉碎了1956年的反革命叛乱后，现在在社会主义工人党的领导下也正以更快的速度建设着美好的未来。
    明尼赫指出，两年半以前，当匈牙利人民处于困难的日子里，英雄的中国人民给了匈牙利人民很大的帮助，匈牙利人民永远不会忘记这一年。
    明尼赫说，为着共同的理想，现在和将来我们都要努力发展匈中两国的关系，并且在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上互相帮助和学习。伟大中国人民的大公无私的干劲，纯朴和自我牺牲的英雄精神，永远是我们要追随的榜样。
    朱德副主席在讲话中说，在匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年这个重大节日即将到来的时候，我们中国共产党和政府代表团受匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的邀请，来到你们美丽的国家，同你们一道纪念这个光辉的节日，我们感到十分荣幸和高兴。我们衷心地感谢你们的热情和友好欢迎。
    我能有机会第二次来到匈牙利，感到特别高兴。当我在1956年1月第一次访问你们国家的时候，匈牙利社会主义建设的巨大成就、美丽富饶的河山、勤劳勇敢的人民以及他们对中国人民的兄弟友情，给我留下了不可磨灭的印象。从那时以来，中匈两国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业，我们两国的深厚友谊，都有了新的发展。我相信，我们这次来访问你们的国家，参加庆祝匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年，并且同匈牙利党政领导人和匈牙利人民会见，一定有助于进一步增强我们两国人民的亲密团结和友好合作。
    朱德副主席最后说，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的正确领导下，成效卓著地进行了斗争和工作，在巩固无产阶级专政、捍卫社会主义成果、进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设各方面都取得了重大成就。中国人民为匈牙利人民的成就感到极大的欢欣和鼓舞，并且衷心地祝望匈牙利人民在建设社会主义的道路上继续取得新的辉煌的胜利！
    新华社华沙19日电　应邀参加匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年庆祝典礼的中华人民共和国党和政府代表团团长朱德副主席今天上午九时半乘飞机离开华沙前往布达佩斯。同机前往的有代表团团员、中共中央委员、国务院秘书长习仲勋。
