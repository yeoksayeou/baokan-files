Turn Resistance into Assistance

At present, there are roughly two types of people in rural areas with right-leaning conservative thoughts: one type believes there are too many difficulties to continue the Great Leap Forward; the other type is complacent and stagnant, unwilling to continue the Great Leap Forward. Those who believe it is impossible to continue the Great Leap Forward argue: "Potential has been exhausted, doubling production is difficult; labor is stretched, further leaps are difficult; ideas have run out, it's hard to come up with new ones; fertilizer sources are limited, large-scale fertilizer accumulation is difficult." Their minds are filled with difficulties and endless worries. Their thinking lags behind reality and is one-sided. They only see one aspect, not the whole picture; they only see the role of material things, not the role of people; they only see difficulties, not the favorable conditions; they only see the current state of affairs, not the continuous development of things. They lack the courage to overcome difficulties and do not study ways to overcome them. Instead, they are weak and incompetent in the face of difficulties, at a loss, and therefore can only conclude that further leaps are impossible. Although this type of person only represents a very small minority, if their erroneous arguments are not refuted, they will become a hindrance to the Great Leap Forward. Our responsibility is to promptly criticize this conservative thinking, enabling them to see the sufficient basis for further leaps, to see the subjective initiative of people, in a word, to help them overcome the one-sidedness of their thinking methods, to turn resistance into assistance, to make them believe that further leaps are possible, and to have the courage to join everyone in further leaps. Some people say: "With yields of 1,000 catties per mu, why bother with further leaps?" "With free meals, why bother with hard struggle?" They are satisfied with a "three cotton garments on the body, three meals in the stomach" small-scale comfortable life. This is entirely a reflection of backward consciousness. They only see personal immediate interests and do not see that the nation's "poor and blank" state has not fundamentally changed; they only see the improvement of personal living standards and do not see the broad needs of socialist construction; they only see agriculture itself and do not see the relationship between agriculture and industry; they only crave immediate ease and forget the grand ideals. Although this type of person also only represents a very small minority, if their negative emotions are allowed to grow, they will also affect people's soaring enthusiasm and become a hindrance to the Great Leap Forward. Our responsibility is to promptly criticize this thinking, to tell them that the continuous forward development of things is an objective law, that we should constantly revolutionize, be a revolutionary, educate them to correctly understand the relationship between the individual, the collective, and the nation, in a word, to help them overcome the problem of ideological stagnation, guide them to look forward, turn resistance into assistance, to restore their courage, and be willing to continue the Great Leap Forward with the broad masses of the people.

We must criticize all kinds of conservative thinking, but we adopt the methods of accounting, comparing, presenting facts, and reasoning, the methods of self-debate and self-education among the people. People with conservative thinking can never argue against facts, can never argue against the truth. Now, those who fear difficulties have begun to cheer up, and those who are unwilling to leap forward have begun to regain their courage. Once they recognize their mistakes, they believe that further leaps are possible, and are willing to leap forward again, and therefore will throw themselves into this year's Great Leap Forward torrent.

### 化阻力为助力

    化阻力为助力
    目前农村有右倾保守思想的人大体上有两种情况：一种人认为困难太多，不能再跃进；一种人自满自足，停滞不前，不愿再跃进。认为不能再跃进的人的论点是：“潜力挖光，翻一番难；劳力紧张，再跃进难；点子想尽，出主意难；肥源不多，大积肥难。”他们的头脑中装满了困难，有无穷的忧虑。他们的思想落后于实际而又具有片面性，他们只看到一点，看不到全面；只看到物质的作用，看不到人的作用；只看到困难，看不到有利条件；只看到事物的现状，看不到事物的不断发展。他们没有战胜困难的勇气，不去研究克服困难的办法，而是在困难面前懦弱无能，束手无策，所以只能得出不能再跃进的结论。这种人虽然只占极少数，但是如果对他们的错误论点不加批驳，就会成为跃进中的阻力；我们的责任就是要及时地批驳这种保守思想，使他们能够看到再跃进的充分依据，看到人的主观能动作用，一句话，帮助他们克服思想方法上的片面性，化阻力为助力，使他们相信能够再跃进，有勇气和大家一道再跃进。有人说：“亩产一千斤，何必再跃进？”“吃饭不要钱，何必再苦战？”他们满足于“三棉上身，三餐进口”的小康生活。这完全是一种落后意识的反映。他们只看到个人眼前利益，看不到国家“一穷二白”的面貌还未根本改变；只看到个人生活水平的提高，看不到社会主义建设的广泛需要；只看到农业本身，看不到农业和工业的关系；只贪图眼前轻松，忘记了远大理想。这种人虽然也只占极少数，但是如果听任他们的消极情绪滋长，也会影响人们的冲天干劲，成为跃进中的阻力；我们的责任就是要及时地批判这种思想，告诉他们事物不断向前发展是客观规律，应当不断革命，做一个革命派，教育他们去正确认识个人、集体和国家的关系，一句话，帮助他们克服思想上停滞不前的毛病，引导他们向前看，化阻力为助力，使他们恢复勇气，愿意和广大人民一道继续跃进。
    我们一定要批判各式各样的保守思想，但我们所采取的是算账、对比、摆事实、讲道理的方法，是人民群众自我辩论自我教育的方法。具有保守思想的人，总是辩不过事实，辩不过真理的，现在，害怕困难的人已经开始振作精神，不愿跃进的人又开始恢复了勇气。他们一经认识了自己的错误，就相信能够再跃进，愿意再跃进，因而就会投入今年的大跃进洪流里来。
