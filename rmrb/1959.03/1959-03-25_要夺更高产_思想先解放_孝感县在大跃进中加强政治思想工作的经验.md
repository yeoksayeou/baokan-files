To Seize Higher Yields, First Liberate Thinking
The Experience of Xiaogan County in Strengthening Political and Ideological Work During the Great Leap Forward
By Our Correspondent Qu Yifan

Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, known for its high rice yields, achieved an average yield of over 2,000 *jin* per *mu* on its more than 700,000 *mu* of grain fields in 1958, more than doubling the average yield of 1957. Among these, 1,004 *mu* of single-crop rice yielded over 10,000 *jin* per *mu*. As a result, the county won the title of Hubei Province's Grain Production Champion for the third time. This year, the people of the county have once again raised the red banner of "Higher Yields, Greater Leaps Forward," fighting for another major increase in grain production—5,000 *jin* per *mu*.

Over the past three years, especially last year, Xiaogan County has created extremely rich experiences in organizing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. The most fundamental of these is: give prominence to politics, muster full energy, strive for the top, and constantly struggle against conservative thinking, advancing in the midst of victorious struggle.

Key to Liberating Thinking

Opening the grain production records of Xiaogan County since liberation reveals a series of encouraging figures: 1949—average yield of 370 *jin* per *mu* across the county's grain fields, 1951—459 *jin*, 1955—605 *jin*, 1956—859.5 *jin*, 1957—1,003 *jin*, 1958—2,053 *jin*. Truly brilliant, each step a higher climb. However, during this journey of increasing yields year after year, Xiaogan County has undergone countless struggles against conservative thinking.

The most intense and acute struggle against conservative thinking took place in 1958. In 1957, the county's grain fields broke the 1,000-*jin* mark. This was originally a cause for celebration, but it added worry to those with conservative thinking. They believed further leaps forward were impossible. When formulating the 1958 production plan, the initially proposed target was only 1,100 *jin* per *mu*. At that time, advanced elements criticized this as a "capital-preservation plan," but some said: it would be good enough just to preserve the "capital." After debate among cadres and the masses at all levels, the plan was revised a second time to 1,200 *jin*. In March, the call for a Great Leap Forward sounded across the country, and the broad masses, full of vigor and high spirits, were ready to go. At this time, under the advocacy of the Xiaogan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the county proposed a new "Double 15" plan (i.e., grain yield of 1,500 *jin* per *mu*, cotton yield of 150 *jin* per *mu*). At that time, some people said:
	"The 859 (*jin*) of the year before last was luck, the 1,000 *jin* of last year took great effort, the Great Leap Forward can only happen twice, not a third or fourth time." Some people with milder tones said: "Small increases are possible, but great leaps forward are difficult."

The leaders of Xiaogan County prescribed a four-character "prescription" for those suffering from conservative thinking: look, check, find, dig. Look at the high-yield models of the previous year; check for loopholes in the previous year's large-scale production; compare and find the reasons; dig out new potential for increased production. In 1957, Xiaogan County had over 1,000 *mu* of high-yielding fields with yields of over 2,000 *jin* per *mu*, more than double the average yield of the county's grain fields. The County Committee seriously summarized the experiences of many high-yielding fields with yields of over 2,000 *jin*, the most prominent features being early planting, high density, deep plowing, and abundant fertilizer (both large quantities of fertilizer and rational fertilization). Various small cooperatives also summarized the high-yield experiences of their own cooperatives. The County Committee, comprehensively summarizing the high-yield experiences of various places, further pointed out that the loopholes in the previous year's large-scale production were precisely the huge potential for large-scale increase in production in the new year. Therefore, the battle cry "Use the technical measures and energy of 2,000 *jin* to guide the large-scale production movement of 'Double 15' (plan)" was loudly put forward throughout the county, refuting conservative arguments such as "production has reached its peak."

After the "Double 15" plan was proposed throughout the county, a rectification movement was launched in a timely manner. The County Committee proposed to summarize the high-yield experience of 1957 through the rectification movement, requiring the achievement of four major leaps forward (ideological, style of work, production, technology).

At that time, some cadres, due to continuous good harvests and successive victories, developed complacency, became lazy in their work, and became detached from the masses. For example, Zhang Qingguan, the captain of the Wulong Second Team of Longdian Commune (formerly the director of a small cooperative), relaxed his work after the great harvest of 1957 and did not go to the fields for several months. After the rectification began, the members posted dozens of big-character posters, seriously pointing out his "ideological illness." Under the education of the Party organization and the help of the masses, Zhang Qingguan finally made a self-criticism to the members, expressing his determination to correct his mistakes. The day after the self-criticism, he went to the fields with the members to transplant seedlings.

After the rectification, the production and work outlook of the entire county took on a new look. Of the original 148 backward cooperatives (small cooperatives) in the county, 142 changed their backward state through the rectification movement. Cadres and the masses united as one, setting off a vigorous production upsurge. In order to participate in production leadership, the practice of cadres engaging in experimental plots prevailed. The cadres' experimental plots further drove the masses to engage in high-yield fields on a large scale, covering a total area of 380,000 *mu*, with the participation of over 100,000 people. In many places, the following situation occurred: a cadre found a good experimental plot and just put up a sign; within a few days, more new signs appeared around this experimental plot, indicating the masses' high-yield fields. Their production targets and technical measures were often higher and more specific than those of the cadres, forming a friendly competition between cadres and the masses.

Learn from the Advanced, Break with the Conservative

In every production link and every technical measure, the struggle between the advanced and the conservative permeates and intertwines at all times. Xiaogan County's experience is to adopt the method of airing views, debating, and mobilizing the masses, learning from the advanced and breaking with the conservative, advancing victoriously in constant struggle.

When the county summarized the high-yield models of various places and proposed the new technical measures of "deep plowing, abundant fertilizer, high density, and early planting" to promote them comprehensively, those with conservative thinking said: "Deep plowing, abundant fertilizer, high density, and early planting are good, but artificial fertilizer is hard to find." Captain Gui Desheng, after consulting with some experienced fertilizer-accumulating old farmers and cadres, posted a big-character poster in response: "Fertilizer is everywhere, only afraid of lazy people who don't move their hands, three exchanges and five relocations, accumulating fertilizer blooms everywhere." After a month of hard work, the team's 2,300 *mu* of fields averaged more than 650 *dan* of base fertilizer per *mu*.

Join Forces to Seize Victory

"Three years of continuous victory, let's see how it goes this year? As long as the whole Party is united, there is no fear of not being able to seize victory." This is a big-character poster that Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, recently presented to Xiaogan County when attending the county's rectification meeting. At this rectification meeting, more than 2,400 people were determined to further consolidate the people's communes on the basis of the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward this year. The battle cry they put forward is: one season (spring harvest plus early rice) catches up with the whole year, total output doubles, vowing to win the first place in rice production in the province.

    要夺更高产　思想先解放
    孝感县在大跃进中加强政治思想工作的经验
    本报记者　曲一凡
    以水稻高产著称的湖北省孝感县，1958年的七十多万亩粮田获得平均亩产二千多斤的大丰收，比1957年平均产量翻了一番多；其中有一千零四亩水稻（单作）亩产量达到一万斤以上。因此这个县第三次获得了湖北省的粮食高产冠军。今年，这个县的人民又高高举起了“高产更高产，跃进再跃进”的红旗，为粮食再次大加番——亩产五千斤而战。
    三年来，特别是去年，孝感县在组织农业生产大跃进方面创造了极为丰富的经验，而其中最基本的一条是：政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，力争上游，不断地向保守思想作斗争，在胜利的斗争中前进。
    解放思想有要诀
    翻开孝感县解放以来历年粮食生产纪录就会看到一连串令人鼓舞的数字：1949年——全县粮田平均亩产三百七十斤，1951年——四百五十九斤，1955年——六百零五斤，1956年——八百五十九点五斤，1957年——一千零三斤，1958年——二千零五十三斤。真是光辉灿烂，步步高升。可是，就在这岁岁丰收的跃进途程中，孝感县不知经过了多少次与保守思想的斗争。
    同保守思想的一场最激烈最尖锐的斗争，是在1958年。1957年，全县粮田突破千斤关。这本是一件值得庆幸的大喜事，但是它却给有保守思想的人增添了忧虑。他们认为再跃进是不可能了。在制订1958年的生产规划时，开始提出的亩产指标只有一千一百斤。当时，先进分子批评说：“这是保本规划”，可是有人却说：只要能保住“本”就不错。经过各级干部和群众的辩论，第二次修订为一千二百斤。3月间，全国各地吹起了大跃进的号角，广大群众意气风发，干劲冲天，这时在中共孝感县委的倡议下，全县又提出了“双一五”（即粮食亩产一千五百斤，皮棉亩产一百五十斤）的新规划。当时，有的人说：
  “前年八百五十九（斤）是碰运气，去年千斤费了九牛二虎之力，大跃进只有再一再二，没有再三再四。”有些语气缓和一点的人就说：“小增产则可，大跃进则难。”
    孝感县领导者给患保守思想病症的人开了四个字的“药方”，那就是：看、查、找、挖。看是看上一年的高产典型；查是检查上年大面积生产中的漏洞；加以比较，找到原因；挖出新的增产潜力。1957年，孝感县出现了一千多亩亩产二千斤以上的高额丰产田，比全县粮田平均单产高出一倍多。县委认真地总结了许多二千斤以上高产田的经验，最突出的特点是早、密、深（耕）、肥（肥料多和合理施肥）。各个小社也纷纷总结了本社的高产典型经验。县委综合各地的高产典型经验，进一步指出上一年大面积生产的漏洞，正是新的一年大面积增产的巨大潜力。因此，在全县响亮地提出了“要用二千斤的技术措施和干劲，指导‘双一五’（规划）的大生产运动”的战斗口号，驳倒了“增产到顶”等保守主义论调。
    在全县“双一五”规划提出之后，又及时展开了整党整风运动，县委提出通过整党整风总结1957年高产经验，要求达到四大跃进（思想、作风、生产、技术）的目的。
    当时，有一些干部由于连年丰收，节节胜利，产生了骄傲自满情绪，工作疲疲沓沓，脱离了群众。如龙店公社五龙二队队长张清官（原小社主任），在1957年大丰收以后，工作上松了劲，几个月不下田。整党开始后，社员们给出了几十张大字报，严肃指出他的“思想病”。在党组织的教育和群众帮助下，张清官最后向社员们作了检讨，表示决心改正错误。检讨后的第二天，就下田和社员们栽秧去。
    整风整党以后，全县生产和工作面貌焕然一新。全县原有一百四十八个落后社（小社），通过整党整风就有一百四十二个改变了落后面貌，干部、群众打成一片，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产高潮。干部们为了参加生产领导，大搞试验田之风盛况空前。干部试验田又进一步带动了群众大搞丰产田，面积共达三十八万亩，参加者达十万余人。很多地方出现这样的情况：一个干部找好了一块试验田，刚插上了牌子；不几天，在这块试验田周围就出现了更多的新牌子，这是群众的丰产田。他们订的产量指标和技术措施往往比干部的更高更具体，形成了干部与群众之间的友谊竞赛。
    见先进就学  遇保守就破
    在每一个生产环节，每一项技术措施中，无时无刻不渗透和交织着先进与保守的斗争。孝感县的经验是采取鸣放辩论、发动群众的办法，发现先进就学，遇到保守就破，在不断的斗争中乘胜前进。
    当全县总结了各地高产典型，提出“深、肥、密、早”的新的技术措施，向全面大力推广时，有保守思想的人说：“深肥密早固然好，就是人工肥料不好找。”队长桂德生找到一些积肥有经验的老农和干部们商量后，贴出大字报回答说：“肥料到处有，就怕懒汉不动手，来个三换五搬家，积肥到处开红花。”经过一个月的苦战，全队二千三百亩田平均每亩有底肥六百五十多担。
    齐心合力夺取胜利
    “三年连把红旗夺，且看今年又如何？只要全党团结好，那怕胜利无把握。”这是中共湖北省委书记处书记王延春最近参加孝感县整党会议赠给该县的一张大字报。在这次整党会议上，二千四百多人决心在1958年大跃进的胜利基础上，进一步把人民公社巩固好，争取今年更大更好更全面的大跃进。他们提出的战斗口号是：一季（春收加早稻）赶全年，总产翻一番，誓夺全省水稻第一名。
