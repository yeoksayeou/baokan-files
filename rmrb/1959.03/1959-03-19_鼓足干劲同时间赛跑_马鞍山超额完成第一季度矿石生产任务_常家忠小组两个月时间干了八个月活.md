    Work with Full Vigor and Race Against Time
    Ma'anshan Overfulfills First Quarter Ore Production Task; Chang Jiazhong Group Accomplishes Eight Months of Work in Two Months
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei) The workers of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's various mines, who are engaged in a high-yield and high-quality competition, overfulfilled the first quarter production plan by 0.34% by noon on the 16th, producing more than 918,000 tons of ore for the country. This exceeds the company's total ore production for the entire year of 1957. The cost per ton of ore has also been reduced from 2.1 yuan to 1.5 yuan.
    In order to ensure the completion of the first quarter plan, the workers fighting in the two mechanical yards of the Nanshan Iron Mine tried every means to shorten auxiliary operation time and improve equipment utilization. Electric shovel operators changed the past method of stopping work for shift handover, adopting on-the-job handover. In the past, because the auxiliary work such as checking equipment during shift handover took a long time, the actual operating time of each shift's electric shovel was only six and a half hours; now, after shortening the auxiliary operation time, the actual operating time of the electric shovel is generally more than seven and a half hours.
    In the semi-mechanized Dongshan mine of Nanshan Iron Mine and various mines of Gushan Iron Mine, the workers launched a vigorous tool reform movement. They replaced shoulder poles and baskets with aerial transportation and wheelbarrows. In the past, using shoulder poles, each worker could only transport two tons of ore per shift; now, using aerial transportation, each worker can transport eight tons per shift. In the past, two people per shift could only screen one ton of ore; now, using a foot-operated vibrating screen, one person can complete the workload of two people.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing) The Chang Jiazhong Group of the Forging and Pressing Workshop of Xuzhou Heavy Machinery Factory completed eight months and three days of work in two months and eight days, without producing a single defective product or accident, and achieving a 100% finished product rate.
    The Chang Jiazhong Group is a well-known "ever-victorious group" in Xuzhou. This year, the group's production tasks have greatly increased compared to last year. In January and February, they accepted the forging tasks of six new products, including 15-ton traveling cranes, grouting vibrators, and 70-ton gantry cranes, as well as twenty other important products. Under the circumstances of heavy tasks, short time, and small equipment, the whole group worked diligently, used indigenous methods to replace foreign ones, and adopted the method of "ants gnawing at bones," creating and reforming twenty-four sets of tools, overcoming thirty-six production key points, greatly improving production efficiency, and ensuring the successful trial production of new products.
    Another important reason why the Chang Jiazhong Group was able to complete eight months of production tasks in more than two months is that the group put politics in command. A competition and evaluation platform was established within the group, with daily competitions and daily evaluations. The group leaders not only frequently mobilized everyone to find intelligent and skillful methods in technology, but also paid attention to strengthening the political and ideological work of the workers, fully leveraging the enthusiasm and subjective initiative of all group members, so that all group workers could eliminate defective products and accidents throughout the entire production process. This powerfully guaranteed the early completion of production tasks.

    鼓足干劲同时间赛跑
    马鞍山超额完成第一季度矿石生产任务　常家忠小组两个月时间干了八个月活
    据新华社合肥讯　正在开展高产优质竞赛运动的马鞍山钢铁公司各矿山职工，16日中午超额0.34％提前完成了第一季度生产计划，共为国家生产矿石九十一万八千多吨，超过了1957年这个公司的全年矿石总产量；每吨矿石的成本也由二点一元降到一点五元。
    为了保证完成第一季度计划，战斗在南山铁矿两个机械场的职工，想尽各种办法缩短辅助作业时间，提高设备利用率。电铲工人改变了过去停工交班的方法，采取跟班交接。过去因为交接班时进行检查设备等辅助工作占用时间长，每班电铲实际作业时间只有六个半多钟点；现在缩短辅助作业时间后，电铲实际作业时间一般都在七个半小时以上。
    在半机械化开采的南山铁矿东山矿场和姑山铁矿各矿场，职工们掀起了轰轰烈烈的工具改革运动。他们用空中运输和独轮车代替了扁担加箩筐。过去用扁担挑，每工每班只能运两吨矿石；现在采用空中运输，每工每班能运八吨。过去两人一班只能筛选一吨矿石；现在采用脚踏震动筛，一个人能完成两人的工作量。
    据新华社南京讯　徐州重型机械厂锻压车间常家忠小组，用两个月零八天的时间完成了八个月零三天的工作量，没有出一个废品和一次事故，成品率达到了百分之百。
    常家忠小组是徐州市有名的“常胜小组”。今年，这个小组的生产任务比去年大大增加。1、2月份，他们接受了十五吨行车、灌浆震动器、七十吨龙门起重机等六种新产品和其它二十种重要产品的锻制任务。在任务重、时间短、设备小的情况下，全组刻苦钻研，用以土代洋、蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，创造和改革了二十四套工具，攻克了三十六个生产关键，生产效率大大提高，保证了新产品试制成功。
    常家忠小组能够在两个多月内完成八个多月生产任务的另一个重要原因，是小组里做到了政治挂帅。小组内建立了竞赛评比台，天天竞赛，日日评比，小组领导人不但在技术上经常发动大家寻找智取巧夺的方法，同时还注意加强了工人们的政治思想工作，充分发挥全体组员的积极性和主观能动性，使全组工人在整个生产过程中做到了消灭废品和事故，这样，就有力地保证了生产任务的提前完成。
