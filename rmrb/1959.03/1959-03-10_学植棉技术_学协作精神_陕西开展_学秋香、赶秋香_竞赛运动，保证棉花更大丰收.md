Learn Cotton Planting Techniques, Learn Cooperative Spirit
    Shaanxi Launches "Learn from Qiu Xiang, Catch Up with Qiu Xiang" Competition to Ensure Greater Cotton Harvests

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 9th dispatch) In order to ensure a greater leap forward in cotton production this year, Shaanxi Province will, on an even larger scale and in greater depth, promote the cotton planting techniques of national agricultural labor model Zhang Qiu Xiang, and further stir up a "Learn from Qiu Xiang, Catch Up with Qiu Xiang" cotton bumper harvest competition.
    In Shaanxi Province last year, over 40,000 "Qiu Xiang" groups in the "Learn from Qiu Xiang, Catch Up with Qiu Xiang" competition achieved a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin of seed cotton, which played a huge role in ensuring a doubling of the province's cotton production last year. Provincial leading organs are requiring all areas of the province to push this competition to a new high this year, and take this as the center to fully implement various measures to ensure a large-scale bumper harvest of cotton.
    Currently, all parts of Shaanxi are stepping up various preparations for cotton field sowing. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee recently made a decision at a Standing Committee meeting to hold a cotton conference in Weinan County or Xi'an City, where Zhang Qiu Xiang is located, to vigorously promote Zhang Qiu Xiang's cotton planting techniques. The Provincial People's Committee's Department of Agriculture, with Zhang Qiu Xiang's summarized cotton planting experience as the main content, is planning to print 40,000 copies of a cotton planting manual, to be distributed to various special districts, counties, and people's communes. At the provincial women's broadcast mobilization meeting held on February 19, the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation focused on issuing a call to women throughout the province to engage in large-scale high-yield cotton fields and large-area bumper harvest competitions, requesting women's organizations in various special districts and counties to promote the establishment of more Qiu Xiang cotton planting groups, engage in large-scale 500,000 mu of high-yield fields, and use this to drive large-area bumper harvests of cotton fields throughout the province. At the meeting, Zhang Qiu Xiang read out her leap forward plan for this year, and proposed a competition to women's cotton planting groups throughout the province.
    In the "Learn from Qiu Xiang, Catch Up with Qiu Xiang" cotton planting competition, the provincial leading organs require all areas to not only vigorously promote Zhang Qiu Xiang's cotton planting techniques, but also to learn from Zhang Qiu Xiang's spirit of unselfishly helping others in the competition. Last year, thanks to Zhang Qiu Xiang's earnest help, Xue Junxiu's cotton planting group, in the same production brigade as her, achieved a high-yield record of 3,104 jin of seed cotton per mu. The provincial leading organs require all areas to promote the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration in the competition, widely organize experience exchanges, vigorously carry out mutual help and mutual learning in the competition, in order to achieve a common leap forward and ensure the overfulfillment of the province's cotton production increase tasks this year.
    Grasping an advanced production-increase experience with universal significance, promoting it year after year, and carrying it through to the end is an important experience of Shaanxi Province in leading agricultural production in the past. Zhang Qiu Xiang had created the province's highest record of around 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu for three consecutive years before 1957, and last year her 4.3 mu of land achieved an excellent result of 2,993 jin of seed cotton per mu, with the highest mu reaching 3,400 jin. As early as the end of 1956, the relevant departments of Shaanxi Province summarized her cotton planting technical experience, and in 1957 it was universally promoted throughout the province. Last year, a "Learn from Qiu Xiang, Catch Up with Qiu Xiang" competition upsurge was launched in various places. A large number of "Qiu Xiang" cotton planting groups were established. Last year, there were more than 4,000 "Qiu Xiang" group leaders who came to Weinan to learn Zhang Qiu Xiang's cotton planting techniques, and 120,000 people went to Weinan to participate in on-site cotton bumper harvest meetings and on-the-spot visits. Zhang Qiu Xiang also made more than a dozen experience presentations in cotton producing areas of Dali and other six counties. As a result, last year more than 4.7 million mu of cotton fields in the province adopted Zhang Qiu Xiang's cotton planting techniques, and more than 40,000 Qiu Xiang groups reached more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, which played a great role in increasing the province's total cotton output last year by one time compared to 1957. This year, the provincial leading organs require all cotton producing areas in the province to further universally promote Zhang Qiu Xiang's cotton planting experience.

### 学植棉技术　学协作精神  陕西开展“学秋香、赶秋香”竞赛运动，保证棉花更大丰收

    学植棉技术　学协作精神
    陕西开展“学秋香、赶秋香”竞赛运动，保证棉花更大丰收
    本报西安9日电　陕西省今年要更大规模地深入推广全国农业劳动模范张秋香的植棉技术，进一步掀起“学秋香、赶秋香”的棉花丰产竞赛运动，保证实现今年棉花产量的更大跃进。
    陕西省去年在“学秋香、赶秋香”的竞赛运动中有四万多个“秋香”组达到了亩产籽棉千斤以上，对保证去年全省棉花增产一倍起了极大作用。省级领导机关要求全省各地在今年把这个竞赛运动推向新的高峰，并以此为中心全面贯彻保证棉花大面积丰产的各项措施。
    目前陕西各地正在加紧进行棉田播种的各项准备工作。中共陕西省委最近召开的一次常委会已经作出决定，要在张秋香所在的渭南县或者西安召开一次棉花会议，大力推广张秋香的植棉技术。省人民委员会农业厅以张秋香的植棉经验总结为主，正在筹划印刷植棉手册四万本，发给各专区、县和人民公社。陕西省妇女联合会在2月19日召开的全省妇女广播动员大会上，曾着重向全省妇女发出大搞棉花高额丰产田和大面积丰产竞赛的号召，要求各专区和县的妇女组织推动各地成立更多的秋香植棉组，大搞五十万亩高额丰产田，并以此带动全省棉田的大面积丰产。张秋香在大会上宣读了她今年的跃进计划，向全省妇女植棉组提出竞赛。
    在“学秋香、赶秋香”的植棉竞赛运动中，省级各领导机关要求各地不仅要大力推广张秋香的植棉技术，并且要学习张秋香在竞赛中无私地帮助别人的精神。去年，由于张秋香的认真帮助，同她在一个生产大队的薛俊秀植棉组，获得了亩产籽棉三千一百零四斤的高额丰产纪录。省级领导机关要求各地在竞赛中要发扬共产主义大协作的精神，广泛组织经验交流，大力开展竞赛中的互相帮助和互相学习，以达到共同跃进，保证超额完成全省今年的棉花增产任务。
    抓住一项有普遍意义的先进增产经验，连年推广，一贯到底，这是陕西省在过去领导农业生产上的一条重要经验。张秋香在1957年前就连续三年创造了亩产籽棉千斤左右的全省最高纪录，去年四亩三分地又获得了亩产籽棉二千九百九十三斤的优异成绩，其中最高的一亩达三千四百斤。早在1956年底，陕西省有关部门就总结了她的植棉技术经验，1957年就在全省普遍推广，去年更在各地掀起了“学秋香、赶秋香”的竞赛热潮。大批“秋香”植棉组纷纷建立，去年前后到渭南学习张秋香植棉技术的“秋香”组组长就有四千多人，去渭南参加棉花丰产现场会议和实地参观的有十二万人；张秋香还到大荔等六个县的棉产区作过十几次经验介绍，因而去年全省已有四百七十多万亩棉田采用张秋香的植棉技术，并且有四万多个秋香组达到了亩产籽棉千斤以上，这对去年全省棉花总产量比1957年提高一倍，起了很大作用。今年省级领导机关要求全省所有产棉区要进一步普遍推广张秋香的植棉经验。
