Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 22nd: Approximately 200,000 citizens of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, enthusiastically participated in tree-planting activities and celebrated "Freedom Day" on the 21st. "Freedom Day" is a festival established by the largest ethnic minority in Iraq, the Kurds, to commemorate their historically significant struggle for freedom. The Kurdish people, under the leadership of the blacksmith Kawa, launched an uprising, overthrew the despotic monarchical government, and at one point established their own free state. Later, "Freedom Day" became a festival for Arabs and Iranians, as there are many Kurds in Iran.

In the morning, a tree-planting ceremony was held in "July 14th" Park. A huge portrait of Prime Minister Qassem and the Iraqi flag were hung at the site of the ceremony. When Prime Minister Qassem appeared, the crowd cheered him enthusiastically and shouted slogans such as "Long live Qassem!" Prime Minister Qassem planted a pine tree in this park. The flags hanging in the park read: "This tree is a symbol of peace."

Many cabinet ministers and diplomatic envoys from some countries to Iraq attended the ceremony. Also present were cultural delegations from China and East Germany. When the delegations arrived at the venue, the crowd applauded warmly. The American ambassador to Iraq, Jernegan, did not appear at the ceremony.

Female students participating in the celebration wore short white dresses, holding an image of Qassem in one hand and a bouquet of white flowers in the other. They sang "The Song of the Tree." A military band played the march "Son of the People," praising Qassem. A female student performed a ballet called "Spring Dance," and male students performed a short play about tree planting and explaining how Prime Minister Qassem helped them obtain land. Another female student said during the celebration that the Iraqi people were like a volcano, and this volcano would burn the traitors to death.

"Al-Bilad," "Al-Zaman," and "Al-Khabar" all published editorials celebrating Arbor Day and "Freedom Day." The commentaries in each newspaper emphasized the brotherly friendship between Kurds and Arabs under the republic government, which had declared that Kurds and Arabs are equal in Iraq.

    巴格达二十万人欢庆佳节
    卡塞姆总理参加植树受到群众热情欢呼
    新华社巴格达22日电　伊拉克首都巴格达约二十万市民在21日热烈参加了植树节的活动和庆祝“自由节”。“自由节”是伊拉克的最大的少数民族库尔德族人为纪念具有历史意义的争取自由的斗争而确定的节日。库尔德人民曾经在铁匠卡瓦的领导下举行了起义，推翻了专制君主政府，并且一度建立了他们的自由的国家。后来，“自由节”成为阿拉伯人和伊朗人的节日，因为在伊朗有许多库尔德族人。
    上午，在“七·一四”公园里举行了植树节仪式。在举行仪式的地方挂着卡塞姆总理的巨幅肖像和伊拉克国旗。在卡塞姆总理出现的时候，群众向他热情欢呼，并且高呼“卡塞姆万岁”等口号。卡塞姆总理在这个公园里种了一棵松树。在公园里悬挂的旗帜上写道：“这棵树是和平的象征”。
    许多内阁部长和一些国家驻伊拉克的外交使节都参加了这次仪式。在场的还有中国和民主德国的文化代表团。当代表团到达会场时，群众报以热烈的鼓掌。美国驻伊拉克大使杰尼干没有在这次仪式上露面。
    参加庆祝活动的女学生们穿着短的白裙子，一手拿着卡塞姆的像，一手拿着一束白色的花。她们唱着“树之歌”。军乐队奏起了歌颂卡塞姆的“人民之子”进行曲。一名女学生跳了一个名叫“春之舞”的芭蕾舞，男学生们演出了一个关于植树和说明卡塞姆总理怎样帮助他们得到土地的短剧。另有一名女学生在参加庆祝活动时讲话说，伊拉克人民好比一座火山，这座山要把叛徒们烧死。
    “国家报”、“时代报”和“消息报”都发表了社论，庆祝植树节和“自由节”。各报的评论都强调指出在共和国政权下库尔德人和阿拉伯人的兄弟友谊，这个政权曾经宣布：在伊拉克，库尔德人和阿拉伯人是平等的。
