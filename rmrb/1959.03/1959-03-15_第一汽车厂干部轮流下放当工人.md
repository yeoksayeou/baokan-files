Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. More than 3,000 cadres from the First Automobile Works will be assigned to work as laborers in batches for one to three months this year. The first group of over 500 cadres scheduled to be assigned in March are leaving their posts and joining various units for labor.

Last year, cadres at all levels of the First Automobile Works universally participated in short-term labor. This year, they will mainly participate in labor for longer periods away from their positions, while some cadres will participate in fixed-time, short-term labor, continuing to uphold the system of cadres participating in physical labor. Recently, cadres at all levels from departments, sections, workshops, and the engineering department who have been assigned as laborers and cooks have consciously engaged in tempering and reforming themselves in production labor, and are universally welcomed by the workers. Wang Zhen, director of the heat treatment workshop, wrote a letter of guarantee after being assigned to the workshop as a carburizing worker, expressing his determination to learn from the workers. From the first day of his assignment, he worked the night shift with the workers, who encouraged him with blackboard news. Cui Shunzhe, chief of the cadre section of the personnel department, was assigned to the second casting workshop as a worker. Although he was physically weak, he still persisted in relatively heavy work and was praised by the workers. Zhang Mingzhong, director of the carpentry workshop, worked as a cook, arriving early and leaving late, which greatly encouraged the catering staff.

    第一汽车厂干部轮流下放当工人
    据新华社长春讯　第一汽车制造厂的三千多名干部将在今年分批下放当一个月到三个月的工人。确定在3月份下放的五百多名干部，正陆续离职到各单位参加劳动。
    第一汽车制造厂的各级干部去年普遍参加了短期劳动，今年他们将以脱离职务较长时期地参加劳动为主，同时部分干部参加定时短期的劳动等方式，继续坚持干部参加体力劳动的制度。最近下放当工人、炊事员的处、科、车间和工部的各级干部，在生产劳动中都能自觉地进行锻炼和改造，受到工人们的普遍欢迎。热处理车间主任王振下放到车间做渗炭工人以后，写了保证书，表示决心向工人学习。他从下放的第一天起就和工人们一道值夜班，工人们出黑板报鼓励了他。人事处干部科科长崔顺哲下放到第二铸工车间做工人，他身体较弱，但仍能坚持较繁重的工作，得到工人们的好评。木工车间主任张明忠做炊事员，早来晚归，对炊事人员鼓舞很大。
