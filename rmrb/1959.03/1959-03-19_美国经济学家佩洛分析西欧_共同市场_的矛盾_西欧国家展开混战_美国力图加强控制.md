Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, New York: An article by American economist Victor Perlo was published in the American weekly "National Guardian" on March 16th, commenting on the economic and trade warfare among Western European countries surrounding the Western European "Common Market." He believes that American corporations will definitely benefit the most from changes in economic relations between these countries.

The article states that due to changes in the economic relations of Western European countries at the beginning of this year, American companies expect to gain more benefits from their overseas investments, and Wall Street bankers expect to strengthen their control over Western European finances.

The results of these changes are: the establishment of the six-nation "Common Market," the replacement of the European Payments Union with the European Monetary Agreement, the implementation of free currency convertibility by most Western European countries, a 17.5% devaluation of the French franc, and the provision of funds by banks in the United States, West Germany, and other countries to stabilize the French currency.

The article states: All these measures seem to suit American foreign economic policy, which since the end of World War II, has aimed to dismantle the control of other countries' governments over foreign trade and financial transactions. The United States' objective is to open the door for the export of American goods, especially capital, and to find ways to repatriate profits earned by American companies overseas.

The article states: At first glance, the tariff barriers of the Western European "Common Market" seem to be an obstacle to the flow of American goods, but there is only some truth to this. Three-quarters of American exports to Western Europe are raw materials and food, some of which will continue to be imported into Europe duty-free or at low tariffs. For example, France has lifted import restrictions on traditional American exports such as cotton.

The article argues that, in any case, the establishment of the "Common Market" is more beneficial than harmful to American corporations, because most of America's overseas trade is now conducted through overseas companies. Expanding currency convertibility will make it easier for American companies and wealthy individuals to earn profits and royalties from Western European countries and to gain control of property in Western Europe. For example, an American doing business in France can remit profits earned back to the United States in dollars, or convert them into West German marks to buy shares in West German companies.

The article also points out that labor is cheaper in Western Europe than in the United States. For example, excluding welfare costs, the wage of an assembly worker at Ford Motor Company in Detroit is $2.44 per hour, while it is $1.05 in the United Kingdom and $0.69 in West Germany. Therefore, American companies have recently been more actively acquiring existing Western European companies to reduce so-called "labor costs."

The article states: The "Common Market" will enable modern factories owned by the United States in Western Europe to sell mass-produced goods in the region. In 1957, the book value of direct investment by American companies in the "Common Market" area had already reached nearly $1.6 billion, and this number is rapidly increasing. The free convertibility and devaluation of the French franc will give new impetus to American investment.

The article states that at the same time as the implementation of measures for limited free convertibility of Western European currencies, the control of Britain's major aluminum company, British Aluminum Company, was transferred to Reynolds Metals Company and Tube Investments Ltd. of the United States, which is probably not a coincidence. Because, according to "Business Week," even before these measures were taken, American factory owners believed that the profits that could be obtained in Western Europe were "at least twice as much as our domestic enterprises." Now, the magazine says: "Almost anywhere American businessmen gather or hold talks… you can hear them talking about a new phenomenon in industry – the transfer of American enterprises overseas."

The article states: American financial groups can now expand their influence in Western Europe through the European Monetary Agreement and the French Currency Stabilization Fund. Of the $600 million fund in the European Monetary Agreement, the United States provided $236 million, thus gaining a major say in deciding who can receive loans from this fund and under what conditions.

Of the $450 million French Currency Stabilization Fund, $200 million was provided by a Wall Street syndicate led by Chase Manhattan Bank and First National City Bank. For these institutions, this will be to establish direct power in France. In the first major deal with the de Gaulle regime, Rockefeller Bank excluded Morgan Bank from playing the leading role in dealing with France.

The article points out that there are obstacles to the series of new economic measures recently adopted in Western Europe, one of which is the increasingly sharp conflict between European capitalist countries, especially between Britain and continental Western European countries. The conflict between the United States and Western European countries over foreign markets and Western European exports to the United States will also inevitably intensify.

However, due to the relative fundamental weaknesses of Western European countries in finance and industry, they are at a disadvantage.

Another obstacle is the continued economic instability of capitalist countries, with the recession in Western Europe dragging on and the American economy still being placed on an unstable military foundation. France's financial situation remains precarious. Due to falling prices, the power of raw material producing countries to purchase imports will be weakened. Unfavorable trends in the balance of trade for several months could prompt other Western European currencies to devalue.

The article states: The most decisive obstacle is the resistance of the people. The strength of French workers against lowering their living standards cannot be ignored. In addition, all economic arrangements are inevitably related to the military construction activities in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization area that are subservient to and dominated by the United States. This activity makes the Western European economy increasingly strained. Due to the emergence of modern weapons, this policy is difficult to implement militarily. It makes the powerful European peace movement and the struggle of labor to defend its living standards eventually form a force that is difficult for reactionary forces to resist.

The article concludes: Regardless of temporary achievements, these measures will not lead to a very complete and peacefully realized European capitalist common market. On the contrary, they will collapse in a deeper crisis of European and world capitalism.

    美国经济学家佩洛分析西欧“共同市场”的矛盾
    西欧国家展开混战  美国力图加强控制
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：3月16日出版的美国“国民前卫”周刊发表了美国经济学家维克托·佩洛的一篇文章，评论围绕西欧“共同市场”问题而在西欧国家间展开的经济和贸易混战，他认为美国大企业肯定将从这些国家间经济关系的变动中获得最大好处。
    文章说，由于今年年初西欧国家经济关系的变动，美国公司预料将从它们的海外投资中获得更多的好处，而华尔街的银行家预料将加强他们对西欧财政的控制权力。
    这种变动的结果是：成立了六国“共同市场”，欧洲货币协定代替了欧洲支付同盟，大多数西欧国家实行了货币自由兑换，法郎贬值了17.5％以及美国、西德和其他国家的银行提供基金来稳定法国货币。
    文章说：所有这些措施看来正适合美国对外经济政策，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，这项政策的目的就是搞垮其他国家政府对国外贸易和财政往还的控制。美国的目的就是要为美国货物、特别是资本的输出打开大门以及设法把美国公司在海外赚得的利润汇回美国。
  文章说：乍看起来，西欧“共同市场”的关税壁垒似乎是对美国货物流通的一个障碍，但是这只有一部分道理。美国输往西欧的货物中，有四分之三是原料和粮食，其中有些东西将继续免税或者以低关税输入欧洲。比如说：法国就取消了对于像棉花这样的美国传统出口货的输入限额。
    文章认为，不管怎样，“共同市场”的成立对美国大公司来说是利多害少，因为美国的海外贸易现在大部分是通过海外公司进行的。扩大货币兑换将使得美国公司和富有的个人更容易从西欧国家赚取利润和专利权以及在西欧取得财产控制权。例如，一个在法国做生意的美国人可以把赚得的利润用美元汇回美国，也可以把它换成西德马克，购买西德公司的股票。
    文章还指出，在西欧，劳动力要比在美国便宜，例如：除掉福利费以外，美国底特律福特汽车公司一个装配工人的工资每小时为二点四四美元，而在英国是一点零五美元，在西德是零点六九美元。因此，最近美国公司都比较积极地在收买现有的西欧公司，以降低所谓“劳工开销”。
    文章说：“共同市场”将使得美国在西欧所拥有的现代化工厂能够在这个地区销售大规模生产的货物。1957年，美国公司在“共同市场”地区的直接投资的票面价值已经达到将近十六亿美元，这个数字正在迅速增加。法国法郎的自由兑换和贬值将给予美国投资以新的刺激。
    文章说，在实行西欧货币有限自由兑换的措施的同时，英国主要的制铝公司——不列颠制铝公司的控制权转移到了美国雷诺兹金属公司和钢管投资有限公司的手里，这大概不是巧合。因为，据“商业周刊”说，早在采取这些措施之前，美国的厂主就认为，在西欧可以获取的利润
  “至少有我们国内企业的两倍之多”。现在，这家杂志说：“差不多在有美国商人聚会或举行会谈的任何地方……你都可以听到他们在谈论工业中出现的新的现象——美国企业向海外转移。”
    文章说：美国财团现在可以通过欧洲货币协定和法国货币稳定基金扩大它们在西欧的势力。在欧洲货币协定的六亿美元基金中，美国提供了二亿三千六百万美元，从而在决定谁可以得到这项基金的贷款和根据什么条件取得贷款的问题上取得了主要发言权。
    在四亿五千万美元的法国货币稳定基金中，有两亿美元是由以曼哈顿大通银行为首的华尔街辛迪加和第一花旗银行提供的。对于这些机构来说，这将是在法国树立直接权力。在同戴高乐政权进行第一次大交易中，洛克菲勒银行排除了摩根银行在向法国打交道中所起的主要作用。
    文章指出，在实行西欧不久以前采取的一系列新经济措施中遇到了障碍，其中之一就是在欧洲资本主义国家中间，特别是在英国和西欧大陆国家之间存在着愈来愈尖锐的冲突，而美国和西欧国家在国外市场和西欧向美国输出货物的问题上的冲突也肯定是会加剧的。
    但是由于西欧国家在财政和工业方面存在着相对的基本弱点，它们处于劣势。
    另一个障碍就是资本主义国家经济继续不稳定，西欧经济衰退拖延和美国经济仍然被置于不稳定的军事基础上。法国财政状况依然危险。由于价格下跌，原料生产国家购买进口货物的力量将被削弱。几个月贸易差额的不利趋势就可以促使其他西欧货币贬值。
    文章说：最具有决定意义的障碍是人民的抵抗。不能忽视法国劳工反对降低生活水准的力量。此外，一切经济安排都必然同北大西洋公约组织地区听命于美国和受它支配的军事建设活动有关。这种活动使西欧经济愈来愈拮据。由于出现现代武器，从军事上说，这项政策很难实行下去。它使得强大的欧洲和平运动同劳工保卫它的生活水准的斗争最终将结成一种反动势力难于招架的力量。
    文章最后说：不管暂时的成就如何，这种措施不会导致出现一个十分完整的、和平地实现的欧洲资本主义共同市场。相反地，它们将在欧洲和世界资本主义更深刻的危机中垮台。
