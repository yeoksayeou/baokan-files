Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 4th: Four million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and neutral trade unions launched a massive second unified action in their spring struggle across the country this morning.
    The goals of the Japanese workers' spring struggle are: to demand higher wages, implement a uniform national minimum wage of 8,000 yen, oppose illegal dismissal of workers, demand the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.
    Twelve unions affiliated with the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions began a 24-hour strike. Workers at Japan's largest steel company, Yawata Iron & Steel Co., also joined the struggle this time, launching a 48-hour strike.
    Workers at fourteen major companies in the Japanese coal mining industry, including Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, held a 24-hour strike.
    Workers in the private railway sector and the metal mining sector launched partial strikes respectively. Approximately 50,000 workers in the chemical industry held a 24-hour strike ahead of schedule yesterday. The Kanto region union of the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation will begin a partial strike starting tomorrow.
    Employees of public corporations and government agencies such as national railways and postal services held workplace rallies and other forms of struggle. Today, the Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial pointing out that never before have so many people from different strata with different demands united in the workers' struggle, and that this is a characteristic of this year's spring struggle.
      "Akahata" called on the Japanese working class to fight to the end, without compromise, to smash the Kishi Nobusuke government's "minimum wage" system, prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and realize the workers' demands.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 4th: The north and south route teams participating in the Japanese people's grand march against war and unemployment successfully arrived in Tokyo today after a long journey. Nearly two thousand workers and citizens in Tokyo warmly welcomed the marching teams in the streets.
    This large-scale nationwide national march held in Japan reflects the Japanese people's strong will for peace. The south route marching team departed from Fukuoka City, Kyushu, on January 6th, and traveled 1,400 kilometers over fifty-eight days to reach Tokyo; the north route marching team departed from Fukushima City, Hokkaido, on February 4th, and traveled 540 kilometers over twenty-nine days to reach Tokyo. Along the way, more than one million people participated in the march at various times. (Attached picture)

    日本工人春季斗争再接再厉
    四百万人展开声势浩大的第二次统一行动
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会和中立工会所属的四百万工人今天早晨开始在全国各地一齐展开了声势浩大的春季斗争第二次统一行动。
    日本工人春季斗争的目标是：要求提高工资、实行全国统一的八千日元最低工资制、反对非法处分工人，要求恢复日中邦交、废除日美“安全条约”，打倒岸信介内阁。
    日本钢铁产业工会联合会所属的十二个工会开始举行了二十四小时罢工。日本全国最大的钢铁公司——八幡制铁公司的工人这次也加入斗争，展开了四十八小时罢工。
    日本煤矿工业部门的三井、三菱、住友等十四个大公司的工人举行了二十四小时罢工。
    私营铁道部门和金属矿业部门的工人分别展开了部分罢工。化学工业部门的约五万名工人于昨天提前举行了二十四小时罢工。日本私营铁道工会总联合会的关东地区工会将从明天起举行局部罢工。
    国营铁道和邮政等公共事业机关和政府机关的职工分别举行了工作场所大会和其他形式的斗争。日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论指出，过去从未有过这样多的不同阶层的有着不同要求的人团结在工人的斗争中，这是今年春季斗争的特点。
      “赤旗报”号召日本工人阶级绝不妥协地为粉碎岸信介政府的“最低工资”制度，阻止修改日美“安全条约”和实现工人的要求而斗争到底。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：参加日本人民反对战争和失业国民大游行的南北两路队伍经过长途跋涉，今天胜利地到达东京。东京的工人和市民近两千人在街头热烈欢迎游行队伍。
    在日本举行的这次大规模的全国性国民大游行反映了日本人民要求和平的坚强意志。南路游行队伍是在1月6日从九州的福冈市出发，经过五十八天走了一千四百公里的路程才到达东京的；北路游行队伍则在2月4日从北海道的福岛市出发，经过二十九天，走了五百四十公里而到达东京。一路上，先后共有一百多万人参加了游行。（附图片）
    日本钢铁产业工会联合会会员2月25日举行罢工，开始了春季斗争。这是东京的钢铁工人举着“废除日美安全条约”的标语牌在示威。
