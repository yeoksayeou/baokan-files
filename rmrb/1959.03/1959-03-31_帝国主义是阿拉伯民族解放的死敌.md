Imperialism is the mortal enemy of Arab national liberation
Yu Zhaoli

The history of the modern Arab nation is a history of suffering from imperialist aggression, and also a history of the Arab people's heroic resistance to imperialist aggression.

Since the decline of the Abbasid Dynasty in 850 AD, the Arab countries have long been in a state of feudal separatism. During the Ottoman occupation, the Ottoman Empire also implemented a "divide and rule" policy. As a result, economic and political backwardness and imbalance occurred in various Arab regions, and long-term conflicts arose between ruling groups and sects. Imperialists, taking advantage of this situation, in addition to constantly carrying out military offensives, subversive activities, and economic enslavement against Arab countries, often adopted the method of supporting the most corrupt reactionary ruling forces and creating conflicts and discord among Arab countries, using Arabs to fight Arabs, in order to achieve the goal of enslaving and ruling the Arab people. Before World War II, British imperialism was accustomed to using this method in its aggression against Arab countries. After World War II, American imperialism replaced the position of British imperialism and became the most ferocious enemy of Arab countries, continuing to use this method.

Here, let us recall a few famous historical facts:

During World War I, British imperialism carried out vicious provocations against two Arab countries—Hejaz and Nejd (now the eastern and western parts of Saudi Arabia). In 1915, in order to induce the Arab people to participate in the war against Turkey, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, McMahon, wrote to Hussein, the King of Hejaz at the time, promising to help him establish a unified Arab country after the war. Thus, the Arabs were drawn into the anti-Turkish war and suffered huge sacrifices. However, Britain also signed the Treaty of Qatif with the King of Nejd in December of the same year, recognizing Nejd's independence. This treaty clearly contradicted McMahon's promise to Hussein. The years of continuous war between Hejaz and Nejd after World War I were precisely instigated by British imperialism. The purpose of Britain's carrying out such conspiracies was, of course, to create conditions for occupying Arab countries after the war. Therefore, in 1916, it secretly signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement with France to divide Arab territories after the war, making Nejd, Hejaz, and other countries in the Arab East completely lose their independent status.

Churchill once bluntly said in 1921: "Two policies can be adopted towards the Arab race. One policy is to dismember the Arabs, make them lose confidence in their national aspirations, and establish administrations formed by local elders in each separate place or city, realizing our own influence by provoking their mutual hostility.... The other policy, I think, is to seek to establish an Arab state in the form of Britain and its allies around the ancient city of Baghdad." Whether imperialists carry out instigation and division, establish their so-called unified states, or combine the two, it is all to develop their own aggressive forces. During World War II, under the guise of "supporting Arab unity," Britain, through its agent the Hashemite dynasty, put forward a series of expansion plans—the "Greater Syria Plan," the "Fertile Crescent Plan," the "Arab Federation Plan," and so on. As a result, disputes arose between Arab countries, enabling Britain to continue to maintain its colonial rule in the Arab region after the war.

After World War II, American imperialism began to show its true colors in the Arab region. The policy of the United States is to suppress and undermine the national liberation movements in Arab countries, replacing the position of British and French colonialism. In December 1956, Dulles made it clear in a secret memorandum submitted to Eisenhower that the main tasks of American policy were to "overcome the strengthening of Arab nationalism" and "fill the vacuum formed in the Near East." American imperialism not only inherited the mantle of British and French colonialists, but also adopted more vicious conspiracies against Arab countries.

The United States uses Israel as its base for aggression against Arab countries, inserting a sharp knife into the chest of the Arabs. Before the founding of Israel, American imperialism colluded with Zionist elements to formulate the secret "Morgenthau Plan." In the war between Israel and Arab countries, the United States supplied Israel with a large amount of military equipment. In the ten years since the founding of Israel, the United States has given Israel more than ten billion US dollars in grants, loans, aid, and donations.

The United States has been conspiring to put together military blocs to carry out aggression against Arab countries. As early as 1951, under the smokescreen of the "Soviet threat," the United States colluded with Britain, France, and Turkey to propose to Arab countries the organization of the so-called "Middle East Command." In 1952, the United States instigated the establishment of the so-called "Middle East Defense Organization." After these blatant aggression plans failed, Dulles ran to the Middle East in 1953 for an "inspection" trip, planning new aggression plans. Under the instigation of American and British imperialism, the Iraqi Faisal dynasty violated the agreement reached between Arab countries and signed the Turkish-Iraqi agreement with Turkey in January 1955. Subsequently, based on the Turkish-Iraqi agreement, it developed into the Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact became a tool for American and British imperialism to carry out aggression, sabotage, and subversive activities against Arab countries. In the eyes of the Arabs, the Baghdad Pact is "the great prison of the Arab nation."

In early 1957, U.S. President Eisenhower put forward the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine." Under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States used economic "aid" as bait, carried out military threats and subversive activities against Arab countries, and even adopted despicable assassination methods. Jordan was the first victim of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In April 1957, under the direct planning of the U.S. Embassy in Amman and with the support of the deterrent force of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, reactionary forces in Jordan launched a reactionary coup, overthrowing the Nabulsi cabinet, which pursued a policy of national independence. In the second half of 1957, the United States repeatedly planned internal subversive activities and external armed aggression against Syria. The Syrian people united to fight against imperialist aggression and received the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world. As a result, the conspiracies manufactured by the United States failed. American imperialism once regarded Egypt, Syria, which implemented a policy of peace, neutrality, and opposition to imperialism at that time, and the later established United Arab Republic as thorns in its side. After the Suez Canal War, when the Egyptian Republic was in extreme economic difficulty, the United States imposed various economic pressures on Egypt and organized multiple subversive and assassination conspiracies. On November 9, 1956, "U.S. News & World Report," the mouthpiece of the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie, openly declared: "The United States has done a lot of work to weaken Nasser's position." "The United States expects those forces that are already in action to eliminate Nasser without military action in about a year." Sure enough, in April 1957, the United States instigated a plot to overthrow the Nasser government and assassinate President Nasser. In March 1958, The United States once again used its agents in the Arab world to conspire to assassinate Nasser with a price of two million pounds. The U.S. State Department stated more clearly in a secret notice issued to U.S. diplomatic representatives in the Middle East on April 18, 1958: "It is necessary to unremittingly consolidate internal forces with Western ideals and foreign forces that can intervene in possible events in the United Arab Republic at an appropriate time. It must be remembered that the disintegration of the United Arab Republic will not only end the fate of Nasser's Egypt, but also make it easier for us to repel Arab nationalism." These historical facts that thoroughly expose the hideous face of the United States towards the Arab national independence movement seem to have been forgotten by some people now.

Imperialism's aggression and enslavement of Arab countries cannot but arouse resolute resistance from the people of various Arab countries.

Between World War I and World War II, the Arab people held many armed uprisings against imperialism. In 1919, the anti-British uprising of the Egyptian people forced Britain to recognize Egypt's independence in 1922. In 1921, the uprising of the Moroccan people against French and Spanish colonialists persisted until 1929. In 1925, the Syrian people, in order to oppose Britain's Palestine plan and support the struggle of the Moroccan people, held an armed uprising against British and French imperialism. In 1920, 1936, and 1941, large-scale anti-British riots occurred continuously in Iraq. These struggles demonstrated the Arab people's deep hatred for imperialism and their firm will to fight for national independence, and in the common struggle against imperialism, they supported each other, forming a wave of great unity of the Arab people.

The successive Pan-Arab congresses held in the 1930s and the Arab League, established in 1945, all put forward concerted efforts to strive for and safeguard the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries as their goals. These organizations have played a positive role in the Arab countries' struggle against imperialism. In 1948, in the Palestine War provoked by imperialism, many Arab countries jointly carried out the struggle against Israeli aggression. Because imperialism used the Baghdad Pact to threaten and divide Arab countries, many Arab countries successively concluded bilateral and multilateral treaties to strengthen the struggle against the Baghdad Pact.

The victory of the Egyptian people in recovering the sovereignty of the Suez Canal and opposing the war of aggression by British and French imperialism and Israel in 1956; the victory of the Syrian people in opposing the American imperialist plot of aggression in 1957; the victory of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the imperialist running dog Faisal dynasty in 1958; the victory of the Arab countries in forcing the American and British aggressor troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan—this series of great victories were all the result of the Arab people's heroic struggle with the active assistance of all anti-imperialist forces in the world.

In the Arab countries' struggle against imperialism, they have always received the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The Soviet state, when it was just born, announced its first foreign policy decree—the "Decree on Peace." According to this decree, the Soviet government announced the abolition of all unequal treaties during the Tsarist Russia period, including the secret agreement on the Anglo-French-Russian co-management of Palestine. Since then, the Soviet Union has consistently stood on the side of the Arab people, and together with the Arab people, has resolutely opposed imperialist aggression against the Arab people and supported the Arab people's struggle for national independence. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize Yemen's independence in 1923. In 1926, the Soviet Union was the first country to recognize Saudi Arabia's independence. After World War II, when Syria and Lebanon launched the people's struggle to demand the abolition of the trusteeship system and the withdrawal of British and French troops, the Soviet Union took the lead in resolutely supporting the struggle of the Syrian and Lebanese people until the Syrian and Lebanese people won victory. Afterwards, the Soviet government and people have also tried their best to oppose the imperialist conspiracy to station troops in the Middle East and occupy the "Middle East Command Plan" of Middle East countries, and to oppose the Baghdad Treaty that undermines Arab national unity and threatens the security of Arab countries.

In the Suez Canal War and the Syrian anti-aggression struggle, in the Arab countries' struggle against imperialist interference in the Iraqi revolution, and against the American and British military occupation of Lebanon and Jordan, the Soviet Union's strong support played a decisive role in the victory of the Arab people. The Soviet Union's support for the Egyptian national independence struggle cannot be obliterated by anyone. On November 5, 1956, when Egypt was invaded and in a critical situation, the Soviet Union issued a serious warning to the imperialist aggressors in a timely manner. At that time, the Soviet Union stated that if the aggressors did not immediately stop the war, "the Soviet government is determined to use force to eliminate the aggressors and restore peace in the East." The whole world knows that it was precisely this warning from the Soviet Union that forced Britain, France, and Israel to announce the end of the war against Egypt on November 6. When Egypt was subjected to an imperialist economic blockade in the struggle to recover the sovereignty of the Suez Canal, and the Egyptian people were threatened by starvation, the Soviet government immediately provided Egypt with 200,000 tons of wheat. When Egypt's cotton was in a sales crisis due to the resistance of Britain and France and the competition from the United States, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries purchased 63.3% of Egypt's exported cotton in 1957-1958. Since then, in order to help Egypt develop its national independent economy, the Soviet Union has provided Egypt with a conditional low-interest loan of 700 million rubles. On the one hand, the imperialists threatened to cancel their assistance to Egypt in the construction of the Aswan Dam project, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union generously agreed to give Egypt a loan of 400 million rubles to help Egypt design and build the first phase of the Aswan Dam.

From the above facts, people can clearly see who are the enemies of the Arabs and who are the friends of the Arabs.

The policy of imperialism is to create divisions, undermine unity, and weaken anti-imperialist forces in Arab countries, and to politically control and oppress and economically enslave and exploit the Arab people.

The policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is to vigorously help the Arab people liberate themselves from imperialist oppression and enslavement, establish politically and economically independent and sovereign Arab countries, and promote the unity of Arab countries in the anti-imperialist struggle.

Today, the most important task facing Arab countries is still the struggle against imperialism. Indeed, the Arab countries' anti-imperialist struggle has achieved significant victories. After World War I, of the Arab colonial territories under imperialist rule, ten countries have now gained varying degrees of independence. The population of these independent countries accounts for 73 million of the total Arab population of 85 million; the area of independent countries accounts for more than 9 million square kilometers of the total Arab land area of more than 12 million square kilometers. However, the Arab people's anti-imperialist cause is far from being completed.

First, more than 11 million Arab people and nearly 3 million square kilometers of Arab land are still under the direct enslavement of imperialism. The people of Algeria, Oman, and Aden colonies are suffering from the brutal massacres of imperialist wars of aggression. Moreover, many Arab countries that are nominally independent are actually still in a semi-colonial status, and the people of these countries are also suffering from imperialist plunder and exploitation, living an extremely impoverished life. For countries that have achieved independence, imperialists are still doing everything possible to carry out various conspiracies in an attempt to strangle their national independence.

Second, among the seventeen Arab independent countries and colonies or protectorates, except for the UAR, Yemen, and Iraq, many other countries or regions still have imperialist troops stationed, or have imperialist military bases, or accept a large number of military advisers sent by imperialism. Around Arab countries, imperialism, mainly American imperialism, has armed 300,000 Israeli regular troops and reserves, 500,000 Turkish troops, and more than 100,000 Iranian troops. These large numbers of troops are a serious threat to Arab countries. In addition, the United States has the powerful Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean, which is said to be to protect its "homeland security." The United States has nearly 20 large air force bases and more than a dozen naval bases in Turkey, stationed with a huge "U.S. Military Assistance Joint Mission" composed of six advisory groups including land, sea, air, logistics, air transport, and engineering. Recently, the United States has signed bilateral military treaties with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. Although imperialists shout that the purpose of establishing military bases in the Middle East and Arab countries is to oppose the Soviet Union and communism, at present, the first to be invaded by the United States is not the powerful socialist Soviet Union, but these Middle Eastern and Arab countries where military bases are being established; the first to be militarily threatened by Turkey and Iran is not the powerful socialist Soviet Union, but the Arab countries.

Third, oil, which plays a decisive role in the poverty or wealth of the Arab people, is now basically still in the hands of imperialism. 99.9% of the oil reserves and 99.7% of the oil production in the Middle East (including Iran) are still controlled by the monopoly capital of the four imperialist countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, of which the United States accounts for 59.4% of the reserves and 58.7% of the production, and American capital accounts for 58.4% of the total foreign oil investment. Imperialists enjoy various privileges in the "oil lease areas" of Arab countries. The "lease area" of the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO), operated by American capital, in Saudi Arabia is 1.14 million square kilometers, which is about half of the total area of Saudi Arabia. The status of the "lease area" in Saudi Arabia is called "a country within a country." Imperialism extracts huge oil profits from the Middle East every year. It is estimated that the seven major oil companies in the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands extracted profits of 1.5 to 1.8 billion US dollars in 1955 alone, and the profit of the US oil organization in the Middle East exceeded 900 million US dollars in 1956.

There is no need to list the figures of imperialist ownership of various enterprises (including minerals, factories, banks, insurance companies, railways, highways, etc.) in Arab countries, list the figures of the foreign trade of many Arab countries that are still monopolized by imperialism, or list the figures of many of the most fertile lands of Arab countries being occupied and operated by landlords and agricultural capitalists of imperialist countries; there is also no need to list the situation of imperialist cultural aggression against Arab countries, list the various unequal obligations assumed by certain Arab countries due to accepting the "Truman Point Four Program" and the "Eisenhower Doctrine," etc. Without listing these, we can have sufficient reason to draw the conclusion that the Arab countries' anti-imperialist struggle still needs to move forward, and the Arab people still need to continue to move forward along the road of unity against imperialism.

People can also see from these facts that American imperialism is the number one enslaver of the economy of Arab countries, American imperialism is the most important source of military threats to Arab countries, and American imperialism is the most important enemy of Arab countries.

In order to oppose the ferocious imperialism and complete the historical task of national liberation, the Arab people are still facing a serious struggle. In the anti-imperialist struggle, it is only possible to win the struggle if the Arab people unite closely, all Arab anti-imperialist forces unite closely, and Arab countries unite closely. The just cause of the Arab people will surely receive the support of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, and the support of Asia, Africa, and all anti-imperialist forces in the world. This support is one of the basic guarantees for the victory of the Arab national liberation struggle.

Not only in Arab countries, but also in all countries striving for and safeguarding national independence, any political force must solve such a problem: either break with imperialism, rely on and mobilize the strength of the people, and unite with socialist countries and all anti-imperialist forces in the world, so that it is possible to achieve a complete victory in the struggle against imperialism; or compromise with imperialism, fear and even suppress the strength of the people; be hostile to socialist countries and all anti-imperialist forces, so that it is inevitable to become a traitor to national interests. Farouk, Faisal II, Said, Shishakli, and others are representatives of such national traitors in Arab countries.

President Nasser of the United Arab Republic is respected because he once led the Egyptian people in a resolute struggle against imperialist aggression, once gave sympathy and support to the liberation cause of other Arab countries, and maintained the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence together with socialist countries and nationalist countries. However, President Nasser, who once won the respect of the people, has recently made vicious attacks on Iraq, on the Communist Party, and on the Soviet Union, which makes people have to worry about where he is going?

President Nasser openly supported the Shawwaf rebel group in Iraq and made barbaric attacks on Prime Minister Qassem of the Republic of Iraq. What is the reason for this? The Republic of Iraq has just been liberated from the shackles of imperialism. The government and people of Iraq stand on the front line against imperialism. What they do in internal affairs and diplomacy violates the wishes of imperialism. It is completely understandable that they are hated by imperialism. If President Nasser is sincerely for the national liberation cause of Arab countries, he should be with the Republic of Iraq against imperialism, and should not be with imperialism against the Republic of Iraq. Unfortunately, President Nasser's fanatical curse against the Qassem government has echoed the tone of imperialism.

President Nasser attacked Prime Minister Qassem for undermining the unity of the Arab nation, but he could not cite any credible arguments. Whether Iraq and the UAR should unite to become one country is a matter to be decided according to the wishes of the people of the two countries. Now Iraq and the UAR are two independent sovereign countries recognized by the world. If the common interests of the anti-imperialist struggle are disregarded and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are violated, and one party insists on annexing the other, it will only cause conflicts and discord between Arab countries, which is precisely undermining the unity of the Arab nation. Those who do this, no matter what they say about the interests of the Arab nation, are actually facilitating imperialists to promote their conspiracy of using Arabs to fight Arabs.

Article 8 of the "Arab League Covenant" clearly stipulates: "Each member state of the League shall respect the government system of other countries of the League, and recognize the existing political system as one of the rights of these countries, and guarantee not to take any action that will change this political system." Who violated this covenant, Prime Minister Qassem of Iraq, or President Nasser of the UAR? Isn't the fact now very clear!

When attacking the Republic of Iraq, Nasser particularly vigorously attacked the Iraqi Communist Party, saying that they and the Communists in Arab countries were all "foreign agents." The Syrian Communists, Iraqi Communists, and Communists in other Arab countries, like Communists in all oppressed countries, are fighters standing on the front line of the anti-imperialist struggle. In the long struggle against imperialism, the Syrian Communist Party and the Iraqi Communist Party have played a well-known outstanding role, and many Communists have heroically thrown their heads in this struggle. The Syrian people and the Iraqi people regard the Communists as the most loyal sons and daughters of the motherland based on countless historical facts. This cannot be erased by any slander.

President Nasser has made the most rude attacks on the Soviet Union, even denying that the Soviet Union has ever aided Egypt and the UAR. This denial, of course, cannot change the facts, cannot undermine the credibility of the Soviet Union, but can only make those who deny the facts morally bankrupt. People cannot help but feel strange, why is President Nasser so self-contradictory? Less than a year ago, during President Nasser's visit to the Soviet Union last year, he repeatedly said to the Soviet people:

"The friendship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is based on the commonality of interests in developing the national economy, opposing aggression, and opposing imperialism. We have received huge assistance from the Soviet Union to shatter the economic blockade that imperialism tried to create for us, and we have received your assistance to develop our country's economy and implement our country's industrialization."

"At the critical moment when we resisted the aggression of imperialist countries, the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship and assistance to us. The Soviet Union stood on our side; in the United Nations and in various international conferences, the Soviet Union supported us. When our people were invaded in Port Said, the Soviet Union defended us."

"Your support for our cause played a huge role in ensuring our victory in this battle (referring to the Suez Canal War - author). ...Your support and your ultimatum were a factor in safeguarding freedom and the hearts of the people in this region of the world."

"The people of the United Arab Republic and the people of other Arab countries regard the Soviet Union as their friend. This friend helps them not for their own selfish interests, but to strengthen the freedom and independence of Arab countries."

How can the Soviet Union now be turned into "communist imperialism" or "neo-colonialism" in a blink of an eye? How can it be said that Egypt and the UAR have not received assistance from any country? The anti-communist newspapers and periodicals of the UAR are now vigorously promoting the slogan of "neither the West nor the East," which is nothing more than deliberately confusing socialist countries with imperialist countries, confusing friends with enemies, nothing more than saying "neither enemies nor friends," and people who do not want friends will of course not make any enemies afraid. On the contrary, this will become a step towards surrendering to the enemy.

The Chinese people are very familiar with such anti-Soviet and anti-communist voices. Chiang Kai-shek attacked the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, and had long abused words like "red imperialism" and "foreign agents."

Before 1927, Chiang Kai-shek had participated in the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudal warlords at that time. At that time, he had implemented the Three Great Policies of "alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants" put forward by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, he had said many, many good things about the Soviet Union. In April 1927, when he saw that he had the possibility of gaining national power, he immediately turned around, opened a knife to the Chinese Communists, the most resolute fighters in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, and immediately turned against the Soviet government, which at that time unconditionally aided the Chinese revolution. At this time, in order to deceive the masses, Chiang Kai-shek did not dare to abandon the slogan of opposing imperialism in words at once, saying that he would oppose imperialism and also oppose the Soviet Union; but Chiang Kai-shek, while shouting against "red imperialism" and "foreign agents," had completely plunged into the embrace of imperialism, and thoroughly and thoroughly became an agent of imperialism in China. This fact made the Chinese people clearly see that the anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance is fundamentally incompatible with the interests of national liberation.

President Nasser's attacks on the Republic of Iraq, which stands on the anti-imperialist position, and his anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda, are ultimately beneficial to whom? Are they beneficial to the Arab national liberation cause, or are they beneficial to the imperialists, the enemies of the Arab national liberation cause? This is obvious. People can see that the American imperialists, who were originally hostile to President Nasser, have changed their tone in recent times. A commentary in the U.S. "New York Herald Tribune" on March 17 said: "Just a year ago, any major defeat of Egypt's Nasser would have pleased most American decision-makers, but today, due to Nasser's serious setbacks in Iraq, core government figures are very unhappy." The U.S. "Time" magazine said on March 23: "It is a welcome change to hear Arabs accuse Communists instead of Western countries of splitting the Arab nation." Imperialists have always been good negative teachers for the people of all countries, and the reactionary policies they have implemented in various periods are negative teaching materials for educating the people of all countries. The mouthpiece of American imperialism is so worried and so happy about the recent anti-Iraq, anti-communist, and anti-Soviet words and deeds of UAR President Nasser. Is this not enough to arouse the deep thinking and vigilance of the Arab people!

The Chinese nation and the Arab nation share a common destiny of being oppressed and exploited by imperialism for a long time. We are closely related in the anti-imperialist struggle, sharing weal and woe. We are willing to offer advice with the historical lessons of China: anti-Soviet and anti-communist will never have good results. Any anti-Soviet and anti-communist hero will never find a way out for his country, nation, and himself.

We hope that the tension between Iraq and the UAR will be quickly eliminated, that the United Arab Republic will correct the path it has recently taken, and return to a policy of adhering to opposition to imperialism, adhering to Arab unity, and adhering to friendship with socialist countries.

    帝国主义是阿拉伯民族解放的死敌
    于兆力
    近代阿拉伯民族的历史是一部饱受帝国主义侵略的历史，也是一部阿拉伯人民英勇反对帝国主义侵略的历史。
    自从公元八五○年阿拔斯王朝衰微以来，阿拉伯国家长期处于封建割据的局面。在土耳其占领时代，奥斯曼帝国又实行“分而治之”的政策。结果造成了阿拉伯各个地区间经济上和政治上的落后和不平衡，并且产生了统治集团间和教派间的长期冲突。帝国主义者正是利用这种情况，除了不断地对阿拉伯国家进行军事进攻、颠复活动和经济奴役以外，经常采取扶植最腐朽的反动统治势力，制造阿拉伯各国之间的冲突与不和的方法，用阿拉伯人来打阿拉伯人，以达到奴役和统治阿拉伯人民的目的。在第二次世界大战以前，英国帝国主义在对阿拉伯国家实行侵略中惯于施用这种方法。在第二次世界大战以后，美国帝国主义代替了英国帝国主义的地位，成为阿拉伯国家的最凶恶的敌人，仍然继续施用这种方法。
    在这里，让我们回忆一下几件著名的历史事实：
    在第一次世界大战期间，英国帝国主义曾经对于两个阿拉伯国家——汉志和内志（今沙特阿拉伯的东西两部）进行毒辣的挑拨。1915年，英国为了诱使阿拉伯人民参加反对土耳其的战争，曾由当时英国驻埃及的专员麦克马洪致函当时汉志国王侯赛因，答应在战后帮助他建立一个统一的阿拉伯国家，由此阿拉伯人就卷入了反土战争，遭受了巨大的牺牲。可是英国又在同年12月与内志国王签订了卡提夫条约，承认内志独立。这一条约显然同麦克马洪答应侯赛因的诺言是互相矛盾的。第一次世界大战后，汉志、内志间连年不断的战争，正是这样由英帝国主义挑动起来的。英国进行这种阴谋活动的目的，当然是为了造成条件，好在战后侵占阿拉伯国家，所以，它在1916年又同法国秘密签订了战后瓜分阿拉伯领土的塞克—毕各协定，使内志和汉志以及阿拉伯东方的其他国家完全丧失了独立的地位。
    丘吉尔在1921年曾经露骨地说：“对阿拉伯族可以采取两种政策。一种政策是使阿拉伯人分崩离析，使他们丧失民族希望的信心，在每一个别地点或城市中，建立起由地方耆绅形成的行政，用挑拨其相互仇视的方法，实现自己的影响……。另一种政策，我想是企求在古都巴格达的周围，建立一英国及其盟国的形式下的阿拉伯国家。”帝国主义者或者是实行挑拨离间，或者是建立他们所谓的统一国家，或者是二者兼施，都无非是为了发展自己的侵略势力。在第二次世界大战期间，英国在“支持阿拉伯统一”的幌子下，通过自己的代理人哈希米特王朝，提出了一连串的扩张计划——“大叙利亚计划”、“肥沃新月计划”、“阿拉伯联邦计划”等等。结果，造成了阿拉伯国家之间的纷争，使英国能够在战后继续维持它在阿拉伯地区的殖民统治。
    第二次世界大战以后，美国帝国主义才在阿拉伯地区大露头角。美国的政策就是镇压和破坏阿拉伯国家的民族解放运动，取英、法殖民主义的地位而代之。1956年12月，杜勒斯在提交给艾森豪威尔的秘密备忘录中就明白地说，美国政策的主要任务，就是“克服阿拉伯民族主义的加强”和“填补在近东所形成的真空”。美帝国主义不但继承英、法殖民主义者的衣钵，而且对阿拉伯国家采取了更加毒辣的阴谋。
    美国利用以色列作为它侵略阿拉伯国家的基地，在阿拉伯人的胸膛上插进一把利刃。在以色列建国前，美帝国主义就同犹太复国主义者勾结起来，制订了秘密的“摩根索计划”。在以色列和阿拉伯国家的战争中，美国供给以色列大批军火。在以色列建国以来十年的时期中，美国给以色列的赠予、贷款、援助和捐助不下十余亿美元。
    美国一直阴谋拼凑军事集团，对阿拉伯国家进行侵略。早在1951年，美国就在“苏联威胁”的烟幕下，勾结英国、法国和土耳其，向阿拉伯国家提出组织所谓“中东司令部”的建议。1952年，美国又策动建立所谓“中东防务组织”。当这些露骨的侵略计划失败之后，杜勒斯在1953年跑到中近东去作“视察”旅行，策划新的侵略方案。在美、英帝国主义的策动下，伊拉克费萨尔王朝违背阿拉伯各国间曾经达成的协议，在1955年1月与土耳其签订了土伊协定，随后以土伊协定为基础，发展为巴格达条约。巴格达条约成为美、英帝国主义对阿拉伯国家进行侵略、破坏和颠复活动的工具。在阿拉伯人的心目中，巴格达条约是“阿拉伯民族的大监狱”。
    1957年初，美国总统艾森豪威尔提出了所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”。在“艾森豪威尔主义”的招牌下，美国以经济“援助”为钓饵，对阿拉伯国家实行武力威胁和颠复活动，甚至采用了卑鄙的暗杀手段。约旦就是“艾森豪威尔主义”的第一个受害者。1957年4月，在美国驻安曼大使馆的直接策划和美国第六舰队的威慑力量的支持下，约旦国内反动势力发动了反动的政变，推翻了执行民族独立政策的纳布西内阁。1957年下半年，美国接二连三地策划了对叙利亚的内部颠复活动和外部武装侵略。叙利亚人民团结一致地进行了反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，并且得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的声援，结果，美国制造的这些阴谋失败了。美国帝国主义曾经把当时执行和平中立和反对帝国主义政策的埃及、叙利亚以及以后建立的阿拉伯联合共和国，看作是眼中钉。当苏伊士运河战争之后，埃及共和国在经济上处于极端困难的情况下，美国对埃及实行了种种的经济压力，并且组织了多次的颠复和暗杀阴谋。1956年11月9日，美国垄断资产阶级的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”曾公开宣称：“在削弱纳赛尔地位方面，美国已经作了许多工作。”“美国期望那些已经行动中的力量，将要在一年左右的时间，不用军事行动就把纳赛尔消灭掉。”果然，在1957年4月，美国就策动了一次推翻纳赛尔政府、谋杀纳赛尔总统的阴谋。1958年3月，美国又通过它在阿拉伯世界的代理人，用二百万英镑的代价来谋杀纳赛尔。美国国务院在1958年4月18日发给美国驻中东的外交代表的秘密通告中，更加明白地说：“必须不懈地巩固具有西方理想的内部力量和可以在适当时机干涉阿拉伯联合共和国国内可能发生的事件的国外力量。必须记住，阿拉伯联合共和国的瓦解，不仅将结束纳赛尔埃及的命运，而且也将使我们较容易地击退阿拉伯民族主义。”这些彻底地暴露美国对阿拉伯民族独立运动的狰狞面目的历史事实，现在有些人似乎已经忘记了。
    帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的侵略和奴役，不能不激起阿拉伯各国人民的坚决反抗。
    在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战之间，阿拉伯人民举行了多次的反对帝国主义的武装起义。1919年，埃及人民的反英起义迫使英国于1922年承认埃及的独立。1921年，摩洛哥人民反对法国和西班牙殖民者的起义，一直坚持到1929年。1925年，叙利亚人民为了反对英国的巴勒斯坦计划，支援摩洛哥人民的斗争，举行反对英、法帝国主义的武装起义。1920年、1936年和1941年，在伊拉克曾经连续发生反英的大暴动。在这些斗争中，显示了阿拉伯人民对帝国主义的深刻仇恨和争取民族独立的坚决意志，并且在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，互相支援，形成阿拉伯人民大团结的浪潮。
    在二十世纪三十年代召开的历次全阿拉伯代表大会和在1945年成立的阿拉伯国家联盟，都提出协同一致、争取和维护阿拉伯国家的独立和主权，作为奋斗目标。这些组织对于阿拉伯国家的反对帝国主义的斗争曾经起了积极的作用。1948年，在帝国主义挑起的巴勒斯坦战争中，许多阿拉伯国家共同进行了反对以色列侵略的斗争。由于帝国主义利用巴格达条约威胁和分裂阿拉伯国家，不少阿拉伯国家间却相继订立了双边和多边条约来加强反对巴格达条约的斗争。
    1956年，埃及人民收回苏伊士运河主权，反对英、法帝国主义和以色列的侵略战争的胜利；1957年，叙利亚人民反对美帝国主义策动的侵略阴谋的胜利；1958年，伊拉克人民推翻帝国主义走狗费萨尔王朝革命的胜利；阿拉伯各国人民迫使美、英侵略军从黎巴嫩、约旦撤退的胜利——这一连串的伟大胜利，都是阿拉伯人民在全世界一切反对帝国主义的力量的积极援助下英勇斗争的结果。
    在阿拉伯国家反对帝国主义的斗争中，一贯得到苏联和其他社会主义国家的同情和援助。苏维埃国家在它刚刚诞生的时候，就公布了它的第一个对外政策法令——“和平法令”。根据这个法令，苏维埃政府宣布废除沙俄时期的一切不平等条约，其中包括英、法、沙俄共管巴勒斯坦的秘密协定。此后，苏联一贯站在阿拉伯人民的一边，和阿拉伯人民一起，坚决反对帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的侵略，支持阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的斗争。苏联于1923年首先承认也门的独立。1926年苏联是第一个承认沙特阿拉伯独立的国家。第二次世界大战结束后，当叙利亚和黎巴嫩展开了要求取消托管制和撤退英、法军队的人民斗争时，苏联带头坚决支持了叙、黎人民的斗争，直到叙、黎人民获得胜利。往后，苏联政府和人民又曾竭力反对帝国主义阴谋驻军中东、占领中东国家的“中东司令部计划”，反对破坏阿拉伯国家团结、威胁阿拉伯国家安全的巴格达条约。
    在苏伊士运河战争和叙利亚反侵略斗争中，在阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义对伊拉克革命的干涉、反对美、英军事占领黎巴嫩和约旦的斗争中，苏联的有力支持，对于阿拉伯人民的胜利起了决定性的作用。苏联对埃及民族独立斗争的支持，是任何人抹煞不了的。在1956年埃及受到侵略陷于危急境地的时候，11月5日，苏联及时地向帝国主义侵略者发出了严重的警告。当时苏联表示，如果侵略者不立即停止战争行动，“苏联政府决心使用武力来歼灭侵略者和恢复东方和平”。全世界都知道，正是苏联的这个警告迫使英国、法国和以色列不得不在11月6日宣告侵埃战争的终止。当埃及在收回苏伊士运河主权的斗争中受到帝国主义的经济封锁，埃及人民遭到饥饿的威胁时，苏联政府立即提供给埃及二十万吨小麦。当埃及的棉花受到英、法的抵制和美国的竞争而陷入销售危机时，苏联和其他社会主义国家在1957—1958年度购买了埃及出口棉花的63.3％。此后，为了帮助埃及发展其民族独立经济，苏联以无条件的低利贷款贷给埃及七亿卢布。一方面，帝国主义者威胁取消帮助埃及建设阿斯旺水坝工程，另一方面，苏联慨然答应给埃及四亿卢布的贷款，帮助埃及设计和建设阿斯旺水坝的第一期工程。
    从以上这些事实中，人们可以清楚地看到谁是阿拉伯人的敌人，谁是阿拉伯人的朋友。
    帝国主义的政策就是在阿拉伯国家中制造分裂、破坏团结、削弱反帝力量，就是要在政治上控制与压迫、在经济上奴役与剥削阿拉伯人民。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家的政策是大力帮助阿拉伯人民从帝国主义的压迫与奴役下解放出来，建立起政治上和经济上独立自主的阿拉伯国家，促进阿拉伯各国在反帝斗争中的团结。
    今天在阿拉伯各国面前的最重大的任务，还是反对帝国主义的斗争。的确，阿拉伯国家的反帝斗争已经取得了重大的胜利。第一次世界大战后，在帝国主义统治下的阿拉伯殖民领地，现在已经有十个国家获得了不同程度的独立。这些独立国家的人口占全阿拉伯人口八千五百万中的七千三百万；独立国家的面积占全阿拉伯土地面积一千二百余万平方公里中的九百余万平方公里。但是，阿拉伯人民的反帝事业远没有胜利完成。
    第一，一千一百余万的阿拉伯人民和近三百万平方公里的阿拉伯土地，还在帝国主义的直接奴役统治下。阿尔及利亚、阿曼和亚丁殖民地的人民，正遭受着帝国主义侵略战争的残酷屠杀。而且许多在名义上已经独立的阿拉伯国家，实际上仍处于半殖民地地位，这些国家的人民也正遭受着帝国主义的掠夺与剥削，过着极其贫困的生活。对于已经取得独立的国家，帝国主义还在千方百计地进行各种阴谋活动，企图扼杀他们的民族独立。
    第二，在十七个阿拉伯独立国家和殖民地或保护国中，除阿联、也门和伊拉克等国外，其余许多国家或地区都还或者驻扎有帝国主义的军队，或者设有帝国主义的军事基地，或者接受帝国主义派遣的大批军事顾问。在阿拉伯国家周围，帝国主义，主要是美帝国主义，武装了三十万以色列的正规军和后备部队，五十万土耳其军队和十余万伊朗军队。这些数量庞大的军队，是对阿拉伯国家的严重威胁。此外，美国在地中海驻扎着据说是为了保护其“本土安全”的实力雄厚的第六舰队，美国在土耳其有近二十处大型的空军基地和十多个海军基地，驻扎有由陆、海、空、后勤、空运和工程等六个顾问组组成的机构极为庞大的“美国军事援助联合使团”。最近，美国已与土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦签订了双边军事条约。尽管帝国主义者高喊在中东和阿拉伯国家建立军事基地的目的是为了反苏反共，但是，在现时，首先受到美国侵略的不是强大的社会主义苏联，而是这些被建立军事基地的中东国家和阿拉伯国家；受到土耳其和伊朗的军事威胁的，首先不是强大的社会主义苏联，而是阿拉伯国家。
    第三，对阿拉伯人民的贫困或富裕有决定作用的石油，现在基本上还是被帝国主义所掌握。中东（包括伊朗在内）的石油蕴藏量的99.9％，开采量的99.7％，现在还控制在美、英、法、荷四个帝国主义国家的垄断资本手中，其中美国占有蕴藏量的59.4％和开采量的58.7％，美国资金在外国石油总投资中占58.4％。帝国主义者在阿拉伯各国的“石油租借区”内享有各种各样的特权。美国资本经营的阿美石油公司在沙特阿拉伯境内的“租借区”达一百一十四万平方公里，即约等于沙特阿拉伯总面积的一半，“租借区”在沙特阿拉伯的地位被称为“国中之国”。帝国主义每年从中东榨取了巨额的石油利润，据估计美、英、荷七大石油公司在1955年一年中即榨取利润达十五亿至十八亿美元，美国在中东的石油组织在1956年的利润超过九亿美元。
    用不着再去列举帝国主义占有阿拉伯国家各种企业（包括矿产、工厂、银行、保险公司、铁路、公路等等）的数字，列举许多仍然被帝国主义垄断的阿拉伯国家对外贸易的数字，列举许多阿拉伯国家最肥沃的土地被帝国主义国家的地主和农业资本家所占有和经营的数字；也用不着再去列举帝国主义对阿拉伯国家进行文化侵略的情况，列举某些阿拉伯国家由于接受“杜鲁门第四点计划”和“艾森豪威尔主义”等等而承担的各种不平等的义务条款了。用不着再去列举这些，我们就可以有充分的理由得出这样的结论：阿拉伯国家的反帝斗争还需要继续前进，阿拉伯人民还需要继续沿着团结反帝的道路前进。
    人们从这些事实中，还可以看到，美帝国主义是阿拉伯国家经济的第一号的奴役主，美帝国主义是对阿拉伯国家的军事威胁的最重要的来源，美帝国主义是阿拉伯国家最主要的敌人。
    为了反对凶恶的帝国主义，完成民族解放的历史任务，阿拉伯人民还面临着严重的斗争。在反帝斗争中，阿拉伯人民紧紧地团结起来，阿拉伯一切反帝国主义力量紧紧地团结起来，阿拉伯各国之间紧紧地团结起来，才有可能使斗争取得胜利。阿拉伯人民的正义事业一定能够得到苏联和一切社会主义国家的支持，得到亚洲、非洲和世界上一切反帝力量的支持，这种支持是阿拉伯的民族解放斗争取得胜利的基本保证之一。
    不但在阿拉伯国家中，而且在一切争取和维护民族独立的国家中，任何政治力量都必须解决这样一个问题：或者是同帝国主义决裂，依靠和发动人民群众的力量，联合社会主义国家和世界上一切反帝力量，这样就有可能取得反对帝国主义斗争的彻底胜利；或者是向帝国主义妥协，畏惧以至镇压人民群众的力量；敌视社会主义国家和一切反帝力量，这样就难免成为背叛民族利益的罪人。法鲁克、费萨尔二世、赛义德、施舍克里等人，就是阿拉伯各国中这样的民族罪人的代表。
    阿拉伯联合共和国的纳赛尔总统之所以受到人们的尊敬，就是因为他曾经领导埃及人民对帝国主义的侵略进行了坚决的斗争，曾经对其他阿拉伯国家的解放事业给予同情和支持，并且同社会主义国家和民族主义国家一起维护了和平共处的五项原则。可是，曾经赢得人们尊敬的纳赛尔总统最近对伊拉克、对共产党、对苏联的恶毒攻击，却使得人们不得不替他担心，他究竟要走到那里去？
    纳赛尔总统公然支持伊拉克的沙瓦夫叛乱集团，并且对伊拉克共和国的卡塞姆总理进行了横蛮的攻击。这究竟是因为什么缘故呢？伊拉克共和国是刚刚从帝国主义的桎梏中解放出来的。伊拉克的政府和人民站在反对帝国主义的前线。他们在内政、外交上的所作所为都违反了帝国主义的意愿。他们遭受到帝国主义的仇恨是完全可以理解的。如果纳赛尔总统是真心诚意地为了阿拉伯各国的民族解放事业，本应当和伊拉克共和国在一起反对帝国主义，而不应当和帝国主义在一起反对伊拉克共和国。遗憾的是，纳赛尔总统对卡塞姆政府的狂热的咒骂已经和帝国主义的调子互相应和了。
    纳赛尔总统攻击卡塞姆总理破坏了阿拉伯民族的统一，但是他并不能举出任何足以置信的论据。伊拉克和阿联是不是要联合成为一个国家，这是要根据两国人民的意愿来决定的。现在伊拉克和阿联是举世公认的两个独立的主权国家。如果不顾反帝斗争的共同利益，违反和平共处的五项原则，一方硬要吞并另一方，这样只能造成阿拉伯各国之间的冲突与不和，恰恰是破坏了阿拉伯民族的统一。这样做的人，不管他口口声声地说什么阿拉伯民族的利益，实际上恰恰是便利于帝国主义者推行其以阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的阴谋。
    “阿拉伯国家联盟公约”第八条明文规定：“联盟每一会员国应尊重联盟其他国家的政府制度，并承认现行的政体为这些国家的权利之一，同时保证不采取势将改变此项政体的任何行动。”究竟是谁违反了这个公约，是伊拉克的总理卡塞姆，还是阿联的总统纳赛尔呢？现在的事实不是很清楚吗！
    纳赛尔在攻击伊拉克共和国的时候，特别起劲地攻击了伊拉克共产党，说他们和阿拉伯各国的共产党人都是“外国代理人”。叙利亚共产党人、伊拉克共产党人和其他阿拉伯国家的共产党人以及一切被压迫国家中的共产党人一样，是站在反帝斗争最前线的战士。在反对帝国主义的长期斗争中，叙利亚共产党和伊拉克共产党起了世所共知的卓越作用，并且有很多共产党人在这个斗争中英勇地抛掷了自己的头颅。叙利亚人民和伊拉克人民是根据无数历史事实而把共产党人看成祖国最忠诚的儿女，这不是任何诽谤所能抹杀的。
    纳赛尔总统对苏联进行了最无礼的攻击，甚至否认苏联曾经援助过埃及和阿联。这种否认，当然不能改变事实，并不能破坏苏联的信誉，而只能使这样否认事实的人们自己，在道义上完全破产。人们不能不感到奇怪，为什么纳赛尔总统前后这样自相矛盾呢？不到一年以前，在去年纳赛尔总统访问苏联的时候，他曾经多次对苏联人民说：
    “苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊是以发展民族经济、反对侵略、反对帝国主义方面的利益的共同性为基础的。我们从苏联获得了巨大的援助来粉碎帝国主义企图给我们制造的经济封锁，我们得到你们的援助来发展我国的经济和实行我们国家的工业化。”
    “在我们反抗帝国主义国家侵略的严重关头，苏联向我们伸出了友谊和援助的手。苏联站在我们这一面；在联合国、在各种国际会议上，苏联都支持我们。当我国人民在塞得港遭到侵略的时候，苏联维护我们。”
    “你们对我们的事业的支持，对保证我们在这场战斗（指苏伊士运河战争——作者）中的胜利起了巨大的作用。……你们的支持和你们的最后通牒是维护了世界这个地区的自由和民心的一个因素。”
    “阿拉伯联合共和国人民和其他阿拉伯国家人民把苏联看做是自己的朋友。这个朋友帮助他们不是为了自己的私利，而是为了加强阿拉伯国家的自由和独立。”
    怎么能够现在一翻脸就把苏联说成是“共产帝国主义”或“新殖民主义”呢？怎么能够说什么埃及和阿联没有得到过任何国家的援助呢？阿联的反共报刊现在大肆宣传所谓“既不要西方，也不要东方”的口号，这无非是故意把社会主义国家同帝国主义国家混同起来，把朋友同敌人混同起来，无非是说“既不要敌人，也不要朋友”，而不要朋友的人当然不会使任何敌人害怕，相反，这会成为投向敌人的一个步骤。
    中国人民对于这样的反苏反共的声音是十分熟悉的。蒋介石攻击苏联和中国共产党，早已把“赤色帝国主义”、“外国代理人”这一类的话用滥了。
    蒋介石在1927年以前，曾经参加过当时中国人民反对帝国主义和封建军阀的革命斗争。那时他曾执行孙中山先生所提出“联俄、联共、扶助工农”的三大政策。那时他对苏联说过许多许多的好话。到了1927年4月，当他看到自己有可能取得全国政权的时候，他就马上回过头来，向在中国革命斗争中最坚决的战士中国共产党人开刀，同时立即同当时无条件援助中国革命的苏联政府翻脸。这时，蒋介石为了欺骗群众，他还不敢一下子在口头上丢开反对帝国主义的口号，说什么要反帝，也要反苏；但是蒋介石就在高呼反对“赤色帝国主义”和“外国代理人”的时候，已经完全投入帝国主义的怀抱，彻头彻尾地成为帝国主义在中国的代理人。这种事实使中国人民清楚地看到，反苏反共的立场是和民族解放的利益根本不能相容的。
    纳赛尔总统这样地攻击站在反帝立场上的伊拉克共和国，这样地进行反共反苏的鼓动，究竟对谁有利，是有利于阿拉伯民族解放事业，还是有利于阿拉伯民族解放事业的敌人帝国主义者？这是一目了然的事。人们可以看到，本来对于纳赛尔总统采取敌视态度的美帝国主义者在最近一个时期来已经改变了他们的论调。3月17日美国“纽约先驱论坛报”的一篇评论中说：“在短短的一年以前，埃及纳赛尔的任何重大失败，都使绝大多数美国决策者感到高兴，然而今天，由于纳赛尔在伊拉克遭到严重的失败，（美国）政府核心人士就大为不快。”3月23日美国“时代”周刊说：“听到阿拉伯人指责共产党人而不是指责西方国家分裂阿拉伯民族，这是一个受人欢迎的变化。”帝国主义者从来都是各国人民很好的反面教员，他们在各个时期所实行的反动政策，都是教育各国人民的反面教材。美帝国主义的喉舌对于阿联总统纳赛尔最近反伊拉克、反共产党、反苏联的言行如此担忧又如此高兴，难道还不足以引起阿拉伯人民的深思和警惕吗！
    中华民族和阿拉伯民族有着共同的长期受帝国主义压迫与剥削的共同命运，我们在反帝斗争中休戚相关，忧乐与共，我们愿以中国的历史教训提出忠告：反苏、反共是绝不会有好结果的，任何反苏反共的英雄，绝不会给自己的国家和民族以及他自己本人找到出路。
    我们希望，伊拉克和阿联间的紧张局势迅速消除，阿拉伯联合共和国端正它最近所走的道路，重新回到坚持反对帝国主义、坚持阿拉伯团结、坚持同社会主义国家友好的政策上来。　（原载“红旗”杂志1959年第七期）
