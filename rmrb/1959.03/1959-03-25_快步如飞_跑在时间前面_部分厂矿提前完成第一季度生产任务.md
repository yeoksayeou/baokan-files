Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, March 24th: Dalian Steel Plant comprehensively fulfilled its first quarter leap forward plan nine days ahead of schedule. This is the first piece of good news from Dalian Steel Plant since responding to the high-yield, high-quality red flag competition initiative proposed by Benxi Steel Plant.

By the end of the first quarter, Dalian Steel Plant's steel output is expected to increase by more than 1.1 times compared to the same period last year. The utilization coefficient of electric furnaces has been rising in a straight line, from 33.358 in January to gradually increasing to 37.4 in March. So far, the average utilization coefficient since the beginning of this year has exceeded last year's annual average by nearly 5, and also exceeded that of its strong competitor, Benxi Steel Plant.

The significant feature of Dalian Steel Plant's completion of the first quarter plan this year is the simultaneous leap forward in the four major indicators: output, quality, cost, and safety. The sulfur content of raw materials entering the plant at the beginning of this year was higher than last year, while the quality standards were much stricter than last year, which brought great difficulties to the production in the first quarter. In order to improve the quality of steel, they took a series of measures starting from January. In addition to adopting technical measures such as raw material drying, they also strengthened the inspection of the production process and product ex-factory, and conducted education on quality assurance for workers, so that the ingot qualification rate increased from 98.31% in the fourth quarter of last year to 99.5%, the cost was reduced by 6%, the average power consumption per ton of steel was reduced by more than ten degrees compared with last year; and the steel varieties were also produced entirely in accordance with the national plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 24th: As of March 21st, seven special districts and cities in Sichuan Province, including Dazhou, Wanxian, Luzhou, Nanchong, Xichang, Ya'an, and Chengdu, had overfulfilled the first quarter pig iron production plan ahead of schedule by ten to sixteen days respectively.

Dazhou, Wanxian, and Luzhou are the main iron-producing areas in Sichuan Province. Due to the increase in pig iron production in these areas, the province's daily pig iron output has remained above 5,000 tons since the 16th; the quality of pig iron is also relatively good, with gray iron generally reaching over 58%, and the sulfur content of native iron generally reduced to below 0.2%.

In order to ensure the completion of the first quarter pig iron production tasks, most leading cadres in these special districts went deep into the production front line to work alongside the workers, cultivated "experimental fields," grasped the party's political and ideological work and organizational leadership, and promptly solved key problems in production. In Luzhou Special District alone, the experimental furnaces contracted by leaders at all levels reached more than 200. In Gulin County, which accounts for 50% of the special district's pig iron production, the county party secretary went to the furnace side to participate in the operation and summed up and promoted advanced experience with the workers, which strongly promoted the rapid increase in pig iron production and quality. Since March 16th, the county's daily iron output has surged from more than 60 tons at the beginning of the month to more than 120 tons. On the basis of consolidating and improving the native blast furnace groups, all special districts and counties extensively mobilized workers to carry out a production emulation campaign focusing on technological revolution to achieve high pig iron production and quality. In addition to comparing the improvement of technology, reduction of costs, and political and ideological work, foreign blast furnaces focused on comparing the utilization coefficient, and native blast furnaces focused on further improving the quality of pig iron.

While grasping production, all special districts also seized the construction of foreign blast furnaces. Many special districts and counties have established special institutions to concentrate local machinery forces to rush to manufacture steam engine and blower equipment, so that foreign blast furnaces can be put into production as soon as possible.

This newspaper, Shuangyashan, March 24th: Shuangyashan Lingxi Coal Mine adopted the method of grasping plans every month, every ten days, every day, and several times a day, and overfulfilled the first quarter production task of high-quality coking coal fourteen days ahead of schedule on March 17th. The excavation of main roadways was completed twenty-four days ahead of schedule.

The more detailed, practical, and specific the leadership work is, the better is an important experience of this mine. In management, they tightly grasped the mass movement of high yield with completing plans on a daily and ten-day basis, and increasing the level of daily output as the center. Around the 26th of each month, the mine party committee formed a planning group composed of technicians, leading cadres and cadres from various wells, and proposed preliminary plans based on tasks and actual conditions, which were then discussed at the party committee meeting, and then fully discussed at the three-level cadre meetings of the wells, teams, and mines, so that everyone knew what to do. In the implementation of the plan, the mine party committee and cadres at all levels contracted different sections and went straight to the front line to promptly reflect the problems in the work and study and solve them, ensuring the timely completion of the plan. In order to achieve large-scale high yield, the mine launched a mass technical revolution movement. According to incomplete statistics in March, more than 6,000 major rationalization proposals were made, and 3,000 have been realized, which played a great role in completing the first quarter plan ahead of schedule.

This newspaper: Daye Iron Mine workers completed 150 percent of the entire month's production task for March in fifteen days.

In February, Daye Iron Mine continuously broke through many major production bottlenecks, and output rose steadily. Production was completed very well in January and February. In the first half of March, due to the promotion of many advanced experiences, the drilling footage was rapidly increased from an average of eight meters per machine to 11.6 meters. Workers in the West Open-pit Mining Workshop, through discussion, decided to eliminate heavy physical labor and put forward the fighting slogan of "Loading trucks takes the lead, driving blasting and transportation to gallop," new and old workers were involved in the technical revolution movement, and in just fifteen days, 193 innovation suggestions were put forward. After the implementation of these suggestions, work efficiency was increased by 30%-50% respectively.

In March, the production task of this mine exceeded the historical level, but it only took fifteen days to complete 50% more than the task. (Attached picture)

    快步如飞　跑在时间前面
    部分厂矿提前完成第一季度生产任务
    钢
    据新华社旅大24日电　大连钢厂提前九天全面完成了第一季度跃进计划。这是大连钢厂响应本溪钢厂提出的高产优质红旗竞赛倡议以来传出的第一个捷报。
    到第一季度末，大连钢厂的钢产量预计将比去年同期提高一点一倍多。电炉利用系数直线上升，1月份为三三点三五八，3月份逐渐提高到三七点四；到目前为止，今年以来的平均利用系数已超过去年全年平均水平将近五，也超过了强有力的竞赛对手——本溪钢厂。
    今年大连钢厂完成首季计划的显著特点，是产量质量成本和安全四大指标比翼齐飞，同时跃进。今年年初进厂的原料含硫量比去年大了，而质量标准却比去年严格得多，这给第一季度的生产带来巨大的困难。为了提高钢的质量，他们从1月份起就采取了一系列措施。他们除了采取原料干燥等技术措施以外，还加强了生产过程和产品出厂的检验工作，并且向工人进行了保证质量的教育，因而使钢锭合格率由去年第四季度的98.31％提高到99.5％，成本降低6％，每炼一吨钢平均耗电量比去年减少十多度；钢的品种也完全是按照国家计划生产的。
    铁
    新华社重庆24日电到3月21日止，四川省已有达县、万县、泸州、南充、西昌、雅安、成都等七个专区和市，分别提前十天到十六天超额完成了第一季度生铁生产计划。
    达县、万县、泸州等专区，是四川省产铁的主要地区。由于这些地区的生铁产量上升，使全省生铁日产量从16日起一直保持在五千吨以上；生铁的质量也较好，灰口铁一般达到58％以上，土铁含硫量一般降到0.2％以下。
    为了保证完成第一季度生铁生产任务，这些专区的大部分领导干部都深入生产前线跟班劳动，种“试验田”，抓紧党的政治思想工作和组织领导工作，并及时解决生产上的关键问题。仅泸州专区各级领导干部包的试验炉，就达到二百座以上。生铁产量占这个专区50％的古蔺县，由于县委书记深入到炉边参加操作，同职工一起总结、推广先进经验，有力推动了生铁产量和质量的迅速提高，全县3月16日以来，铁的日产量已由月初的六十多吨，猛增到一百二十多吨。各专区、县在巩固与提高土高炉群的基础上，都广泛地发动职工开展了以技术革命为中心的生铁高产高质竞赛评比运动。除了比改进技术、降低成本，比政治思想工作以外，洋高炉着重比利用系数，土高炉着重比进一步提高生铁质量。
    在抓生产的同时，各专区都抓紧了洋高炉的建设。许多专区、县都成立了专门机构，集中本地机械力量赶制蒸汽机、鼓风机设备，使洋高炉尽快投入生产。
    煤
    本报双鸭山24日电双鸭山岭西煤矿采取了月月抓计划，旬旬抓计划，日日抓计划，一日抓几抓的办法，于3月17日提前十四天超额完成首季优质焦煤的生产任务。主要巷道掘进提前二十四天完成了掘进计划。
    领导工作愈做愈细，愈做愈实际，愈做愈具体，是这个矿的一条重要经验。他们在管理工作中紧紧地抓住了以按日按旬完成计划，以提高日产水平为中心的大面积丰产运动。在每个月26日左右，矿党委即组成由技术人员，领导干部和各井干部参加的计划编制小组，根据任务和实际情况提出初步方案，然后在党委会上讨论，再经过全矿的井、队、矿三级干部会议进行充分讨论后，使人人心中有数。在执行计划中，矿党委以及各级干部，分片包干一竿子插到第一线，及时把工作中的问题反映上来，加以研究解决，保证了计划的按时完成。为实现大面积丰产，这个矿开展了群众性的技术革命运动。据3月份不完全统计，共出现重大的合理化建议达六千余件，已经实现的有三千件，这对提前完成第一季度计划起了很大作用。
    矿石
    本报讯　大冶铁矿的职工用十五天的时间，完成了3月全月生产任务的百分之一百五十。
    2月份，大冶铁矿连续攻破了许多重大生产关键，产量节节上升。1、2月份生产完成得很好。3月上半月，由于推广了许多先进经验，钻岩进尺即由每台平均八公尺迅速提高到十一点六公尺。西露天采矿车间职工，通过讨论确定消灭笨重体力劳动，并提出了“装车一马当先，带动爆破、运输万马奔腾”的战斗口号，新老工人一起卷入了技术革命运动，仅十五天时间，就提出一百九十三项革新建议，实现这些建议后，工效分别提高了30％——50％以上。
    3月份，这个矿生产任务超过历来水平，然而仅用了十五天的时间就超额50％完成了。（附图片）
    北京钢厂一号电炉提前九天完成了第一季度钢产计划，钢的合格率达到百分之百。炉前奋战的工人们，在提前完成计划之后，正在为生产更多的好钢而战。　　　　　　　　新华社记者　安　康摄
