Ensure the Completion of National Tasks
Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company

Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO) still needs two years to be fully completed. The situation this year: production is beginning to enter its peak, and construction is at its highest peak. This situation requires us to not only do a good job in production but also do a good job in construction. The task is extremely arduous.

However, we have full confidence in completing the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the country. First, we have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee; second, our team, after the victory of the rectification campaign, was tested in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and has greatly improved in ideology and organization; third, the broad masses of workers have the confidence to overcome difficulties and achieve victory; fourth, all aspects are actively supporting us, especially the leading organs of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, which often care about us and vigorously help us solve various problems. In January and February of this year, we have overcome various difficulties and accelerated the construction progress of No. 2 Blast Furnace, No. 3 Coke Oven, sintering, ore dressing, and open hearth furnace. The rolling mill project has already started digging foundations.

Of course, there are still many difficulties in construction and production. For example, the production team cannot yet skillfully use modern automated equipment, a large number of new apprentices cannot fully adapt to the needs of production, and some materials and equipment cannot keep up with the construction progress. Transportation also has difficulties. But these difficulties are difficulties in progress. They are being overcome one by one, batch by batch.

In order to accomplish our tasks, we will organize this year's Great Leap Forward in production and construction based on the following principles:

First, within the entire company, further implement the principle of unified leadership. Under the guidance of the idea of the whole country as a single chessboard, the whole Party is of one heart, ensuring the realization of the production targets for steel, iron, steel products, and coke.

Second, maximize the combination of self-reliance and striving for foreign aid. Actively organize the production of refractory materials, cement, small steel products, lime, ferromanganese, ferrosilicon, welding rods, calcium carbide, etc., and organize the production of some non-standard equipment and simple tools.

Third, seize the breakthrough of weak links, one is mining, one is transportation, and one is spare parts manufacturing. In this regard, implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs.

Fourth, mobilize the masses to take various measures to improve labor productivity, thoroughly rectify labor organization, and improve labor management. Vigorously promote the advanced experience of cultivating technical forces, and rely on the masses to continuously improve the technical level of workers.

Fifth, carry out a technical revolution movement, with the aim of completing the plan, organize cadres, workers, and technicians to solve key production problems.

1959 is a decisive year for the construction of WISCO. Currently, we are carrying out a mass movement to compare targets, measures, and enthusiasm. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to complete and strive to overfulfill our tasks.

    确保完成国家任务
    武汉钢铁公司总经理  李一清
    武钢还需要两年才能全部建成。今年的形势：生产开始进入高峰，施工已是最高峰；这个形势，要求我们既要把生产搞好，又要把施工搞好，任务是十分艰巨的。
    但是，我们有充分的信心完成党和国家交给我们的任务。第一，有党中央的正确领导；第二，我们的队伍在整风胜利之后又在1958年的大跃进中经过了考验，在思想上组织上大大提高了一步；第三，广大职工群众具有克服困难，取得胜利的信心；第四，各方面都在积极支援我们，特别是湖北省、武汉市的领导机关经常关心我们，大力帮助我们解决各种问题。今年1、2月间我们已战胜各种困难，加速了二号高炉、三号焦炉、烧结、选矿、平炉的建设进度，轧钢工程已经开始挖基础。
    当然，在建设和生产中还存在着不少困难。如生产队伍还不能熟练地运用现代化的自动设备，大量的新徒工还不能完全适应生产的需要，材料设备有些还赶不上建设进度，交通运输也还有困难。但是这些困难都是前进中的困难。正在一个一个地、一批一批地克服着。
    为了完成我们的任务，我们将依据以下几项原则，组织今年生产建设大跃进。
    第一，在全公司范围内，进一步贯彻统一领导原则，在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，全党一条心，确保钢、铁、钢材、焦炭的生产指标实现。
    第二，最大限度地实行自力更生与争取外援相结合，积极组织耐火材料、水泥、小型钢材、石灰、锰铁、矽铁、电焊条、电石等的生产，和组织部分非标准设备与简易机具的生产。
    第三，抓紧突破薄弱环节，一是矿山，一是交通运输，一是备品备件制造。在这方面贯彻执行土洋结合与两条腿走路的方针。
    第四，发动群众采取各种办法提高劳动生产率，彻底整顿劳动组织，改进劳动管理。大力推广培养技术力量的先进经验，依靠群众不断地提高工人的技术水平。
    第五，开展技术革命运动，以完成计划为目的，组织干部、工人、技术人员解决生产关键问题。
    1959年是武钢建设决定性的一年。目前，我们正在开展比指标、比措施、比干劲的群众运动。我们相信，在党的领导下，我们一定能够完成并力争超额完成任务。
