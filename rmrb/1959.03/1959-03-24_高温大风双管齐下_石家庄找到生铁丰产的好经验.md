High Temperature and Strong Wind Work Together
Shijiazhuang Finds Good Experience for High Pig Iron Yield

(Our newspaper, Shijiazhuang, March 23rd) In the red flag competition for high yield, high quality, and reduced coke ratio, the iron smelting plants in the Shijiazhuang area have seized technical innovations and implemented high temperature and strong wind, resulting in a new situation in production. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-five blast furnaces in the Shijiazhuang area that have already used high temperature and strong wind, the average daily output of blast furnaces has increased nearly doubled, the average coke ratio has dropped to below 1.5, and the sulfur content is all below 0.15. This proves that it is an important experience for achieving an all-round bumper harvest in iron smelting production.

In all units that implemented high temperature and strong wind, regardless of the size of the furnace, the output increased in a straight line, and the coke ratio continued to decline. In order to achieve high yield, high quality, and reduce coke ratio, the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant focused on high temperature and strong wind. It adopted the method of parallel connection, increasing and connecting fans in series to ensure sufficient air volume for the blast furnace. The wind temperature and pressure have been universally improved, effectively increasing the smelting intensity. The No. 4 blast furnace of this factory, with a volume of 55 cubic meters, uses two 200 cubic meter air volume blowers in parallel, doubling the air volume, and the wind pressure has also increased from 0.38 to 0.46. The daily output has increased sharply from 36 tons to 55.34 tons, and the utilization coefficient has broken through a major barrier. The coke ratio has dropped to an advanced level of 1.214. The No. 1 blast furnace (15 cubic meters) of this factory had an average daily output of 9.24 tons at the end of February. They adopted multi-nozzle combustion to increase the wind temperature, and also connected two 42 cubic meter blowers in parallel. As a result, the average daily output in early March reached 20.94 tons, and the average utilization coefficient reached 1.38. The daily output increased by more than double compared to the end of February. The 6.5 small blast furnace of the Xinsheng Iron Smelting Plant used two 24 cubic meter fans in parallel. After increasing the air volume, the average daily iron output in early January was 10.78 tons, and the average utilization coefficient reached 1.66. The highest daily output was 13.954 tons. Due to the increase in output and quality, and the significant reduction in coke consumption, the production cost per ton of iron dropped to below 200 yuan.

The workers of the Pingshan Iron Smelting Plant, who initiated the friendship competition to the whole province, heard that the 6.5 small blast furnace of the Xinsheng Iron Smelting Plant had exceeded 13 tons. They refused to be outdone and proposed "Work hard for five days, resolutely use strong wind, double the output, and look back at Xinsheng." As a result, within a few days, they connected twelve blowers in parallel to six small blast furnaces, and the air volume was generally doubled (all 6.5). They also made full use of multi-nozzle combustion, and the wind temperature was as high as 700 degrees Celsius. The output rose steadily. On the first day the No. 6 furnace blower was connected in parallel, the output increased from more than 5 tons to 8 tons, the second day was 9.9 tons, and the third day the output reached 15.593 tons, creating the highest record in the province. Moreover, all the iron produced was first-class, and the coke consumption per ton of iron was reduced to 0.93.

The experience of various factories proves that high temperature and strong wind are closely linked. However, before using strong wind, the hot blast stove should be modified first and multi-nozzle combustion should be implemented to achieve high temperature. Otherwise, if the furnace temperature does not rise, simply using strong wind will easily reduce the furnace temperature, produce white iron, and even cause the blast furnace to freeze. However, if only high temperature is used without increasing wind pressure and air volume, the furnace will not have enough air volume and the air permeability will not be strong, which will lead to high material suspension and poor digestion, affecting the output. High temperature and strong wind should be carried out simultaneously, comprehensively reformed, and the pipes should be thickened and the air nozzles enlarged. Only in this way can we achieve an all-round bumper harvest of high yield, high quality, and reduced coke ratio.

Based on the above experience, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to implement multi-nozzle combustion and blower parallel connection in all 241 blast furnaces before May, and universally adopt high temperature and strong wind smelting, in order to achieve or break through the four major competition indicators stipulated by the province in various furnace types.

    高温大风双管齐下
    石家庄找到生铁丰产的好经验
    本报石家庄23日电　石家庄地区各炼铁厂，在开展高产优质降低焦比红旗竞赛运动中，抓住技术革新，实行高温大风，生产出现新局面。据石家庄地区各炼铁厂已经运用高温大风的二十五个炼铁炉的初步统计，高炉日产量平均提高近一倍，焦比平均降到一点五以下，含硫量都低于零点一五。证明它是炼铁生产获得全面丰收的一项重要的经验。
    凡是实行高温大风的单位，不论炉型大小，产量均直线上升，焦比连续下降。石家庄钢铁厂为了达到高产、优质、降低焦比的目的，这个厂大抓高温大风，采取并连、增装和串连风机的办法，使高炉得到充足风量，风温、风压普遍提高，有效地提高了冶炼强度。这个厂五十五立方公尺的四号高炉，采用两个二百立方公尺风量的鼓风机并开，风量加大了一倍，风压也由零点三八上升到零点四六，日产量由三十六吨猛增为五十五点三四吨，利用系数突破了一大关，焦比降到一点二一四的先进水平。这个厂一号高炉（十五立方公尺）2月底平均日产九点二四吨，他们采用了多嘴燃烧提高风温，又把两个四十二立方公尺的鼓风机并连开动，因而3月上旬日产量平均达到二十点九四吨，利用系数平均达到一点三八，日产量比2月底增加一倍还多。新生炼铁厂的六点五的小高炉，采用两个二十四立方公尺的风机并开，加大风量以后，1月上旬平均日产铁十点七八吨，利用系数平均达到一点六六，最高日产量为十三点九五四吨。由于产量和质量的提高，焦炭消耗的显著减少，每吨铁的生产成本降到二百元以下。
    向全省发出友谊竞赛倡议的平山炼铁厂的工人们，听说新生炼铁厂六点五的小高炉突破十三吨以上。他们不肯甘拜下风，提出“大干五天整，坚决用大风，产量成倍番，回头看新生”。结果几天内把十二台鼓风机并连在六个小高炉上，风量普遍增加一倍（都是六点五的），还全部利用多嘴燃烧，风温高达七百度以上，产量节节上升，六号炉风机并开的第一天，产量就由五吨多增为八吨，第二天九点九吨，第三天产量高达十五点五九三吨，创造了全省最高纪录。而且全部出的是一级铁，吨铁焦炭消耗降为零点九三。
    各厂的经验证明，高温、大风是紧密结合的。但在采用大风以前，应该首先改装热风炉，实行多嘴燃烧，达到高温。不然炉温上不去，单纯运用大风，容易降低炉温，出白口铁，甚至造成高炉冻结。但只用高温而不增加风压、风量，炉子风量不足，透气性不强，又会形成高料悬料，消化不良，影响产量。高温大风应同时并行，全面改革，并相互的加粗管道，改大风嘴。这样才能获得高产、优质、降低焦比的全面丰收。
    根据上述经验，中共石家庄地委决定在5月份以前，将二百四十一座高炉，实行多嘴燃烧，风机并连，普遍采用高温大风冶炼，要在各种炉型上分别实现或突破省规定的四大竞赛指标。
