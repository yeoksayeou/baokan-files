Hold More Material Exchange Meetings Like This

During the recent National Native Produce and Waste Products Conference, the Ministry of Commerce held a material exchange meeting. At the meeting, small native products and commodities that were not within the scope of the state's unified purchase and allocation were rationally exchanged. The units requiring goods submitted purchase orders to the relevant producing areas based on local needs, requesting the producing areas to plan production and organize supply. The producing areas also took the initiative to propose what materials they could offer for exchange with other regions. After consultation and agreement between the producing and marketing parties, contracts or agreements were signed. After the representatives of each province return, they will hold such material exchange meetings at all levels, until the people's communes incorporate the commodities stipulated in the contracts into their production plans, thus ensuring the implementation of all contracts and agreements. This kind of material exchange meeting is worth greatly promoting.

After the people's communes were established, the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, self-sufficient production and commodity production was adopted in the development of production. This requires the people's communes to be more planned in their production arrangements, and also requires the production of the people's communes to meet the needs of the state and be incorporated into the orbit of the state plan. To achieve this, the commercial departments need to sign contracts with the communes according to the needs of the state and the market, to guide the communes in developing diversified operations.

However, how can the commercial departments of one region know what commodities other regions need and when? Especially those small native products and commodities with complex varieties, it is even more difficult to understand clearly. Therefore, organizing inter-regional exchanges through material exchange meetings is a very good method.

Material exchange meetings were a form frequently used in our country during the period of national economic recovery. At that time, they played a great role in enlivening urban and rural economy and developing production. Today's material exchange is developed on the basis of the past, and is a new type of material exchange adapted to the new situation of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production and the people's commune system. It has very important significance.

From the perspective of the state's requirements, the supply of all materials, large and small, in the domestic market currently relies on state-owned commercial departments for unified arrangements. However, there are tens of thousands of types of commodities in the country, and it is impossible to arrange everything through the state plan. Therefore, in addition to the centralized management of important commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihood, the best form for arranging some scattered small native products and commodities, from the current situation, is to hold material exchange meetings.

Therefore, material exchange meetings are an important method to rationally allocate many commodities in the spirit of "one game of chess nationwide," following the principles of ensuring key points, taking care of general needs, and strengthening collaboration. It not only plays a great role in balancing national materials and ensuring supply, but also promotes and guides the people's communes to carry out diversified operations and develop production.

The material exchange meeting held during this National Native Produce and Waste Products Conference has made a good start in organizing the exchange of small native products. Provinces, special zones, and counties should hold this new type of material exchange meeting as soon as possible. Commercial departments at all levels should, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, take on the responsibility of organizing and leading material exchange meetings.

### 多开这样的物资交流会

    多开这样的物资交流会
    商业部在最近召开的全国土产废品会议期间，举行了一次物资交流会。会上，把不在国家统一收购、调拨范围内的小土产、小商品作了合理的交流。由要货单位根据本地需要向有关产区提出要货单，请产区规划生产、组织供应；产区也主动提出本地区可以拿出什么物资来和外地进行交换；经过产销双方协商同意后，就签订合同或协议。各省代表回去后，还要层层召开这样的物资交流会，一直到人民公社把合同中规定的商品纳入生产计划为止，这样就使所有合同和协议的执行有了保证。这种物资交流会是值得大大提倡的。
    人民公社化以后，在发展生产上采取了工业和农业、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针。这样，一方面要求人民公社在生产的安排上做到更有计划；另一方面又要求人民公社的生产必须符合国家的需要，纳入国家计划的轨道。要做到这一点，就需要商业部门根据国家和市场的需要，与公社签订合同，来指导公社发展多种经营。
    但是，一个地区的商业部门又怎样能了解别的地区在什么时候需要什么商品呢？特别是那些品种复杂的小土产、小商品，就更难了解清楚了。因此，通过物资交流会，组织地区之间互通有无，是很好的办法。
    物资交流会是我国在国民经济恢复时期经常运用的一种形式，当时对活跃城乡经济、发展生产曾经起过很大的作用。今天的物资交流，是在过去的基础上发展起来的，适应全国工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化新形势的一种新型的物资交流。它有着很重要的意义。
    再从国家的要求来看，目前国内市场一切大小物资的供应，都要依靠国营商业部门来统一安排。但是全国的商品种类数以万计，要完全通过国家计划来安排是不可能的。因此，国家除了对关系国计民生重大的商品实行集中管理外，对于一些零星的小土产、小商品的安排，从目前的情况看来，最好的形式就是举行物资交流会。
    因此，物资交流会是使许多商品在全国一盘棋的精神下，按照保证重点、照顾一般、加强协作的原则进行合理分配的一种重要方法，它不仅对平衡全国物资、保证供应起着极大的作用，而且对人民公社开展多种经营、发展生产起着促进和指导的作用。
    这次全国土产废品会议期间举行的物资交流会，对组织小土产的交流已经有了良好的开端。各省、各专区、各县要尽快地召开这种新型的物资交流会。各级商业部门应该在各级党委的领导下，很好地担负起组织领导物资交流会的责任。
