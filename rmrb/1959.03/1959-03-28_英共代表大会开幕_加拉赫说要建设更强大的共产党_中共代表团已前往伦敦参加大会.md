Xinhua News Agency, London, March 27th: The 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain opened here this morning.

    In his opening address, William Gallacher, honorary chairman of the Communist Party, contrasted the great progress of socialist countries with the moribund state of capitalist countries. He said that in capitalist countries, ten million or twelve million people are unemployed, not counting those with only short-term jobs, which means there is a truly large-scale phenomenon of misery and suffering. He said that the monopoly capitalist groups in these countries are trying to cut each other's throats in the struggle for markets. He said that, in contrast to this situation in capitalist countries, the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, China's Great Leap Forward, and the rapid development of every socialist country show that socialist countries are striding forward. He said, "We can see the forces changing the world advancing everywhere."

    Gallacher then said: "The sick agents of a sick system do not want to die. The organized working class must see them off before they get the chance to destroy the world. This is our world - the world of the people, not the private property of a handful of crazy capitalists. We must preserve this world."

    Gallacher criticized the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party, saying: "The Labor Party published a document in 1918: 'Labor and the New Social Order,' which said that the Labor Party would not help capitalism revive; on the contrary, it would do everything possible to bury capitalism."

    "Forty years later, instead of carrying out the work of burial, the right wing intends to implement capitalism more effectively than the Conservatives. This is a shameful betrayal of our pioneers. Our party must rescue the labor movement from the quagmire of capitalism and return it to the safe and reliable road of socialism."

    Speaking of the international situation, Gallacher pointed out the danger that the British people are being dragged down the dangerous path of Dulles and Adenauer's brinkmanship. He warned: "Sick old men desperately trying to save a sick old system can become very dangerous, so we must never relax the struggle for peaceful negotiations and effective control of the madmen." Speaking of the struggle of the people of Central Africa for independence, he said that now is the time for Britain to leave there and give them a chance to do things for themselves. Gallacher praised those party members who stood firm in the storms before, during, and after the last party congress. He said, "We have shown our enemies that lies and slander cannot lead our party, which is firmly established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, away from the British road to socialism."

    In closing his opening address, Gallacher said, "Let us, from this congress onward, meet the upcoming elections with the spirit that will break the two parties' monopoly on Parliament!

    "We must rebuild the workers' confidence in the great and glorious socialism and communism. For peace, for the progress of mankind, for the unity of the working class at home, for the solidarity with our brothers in colonial countries, for proletarian internationalism, for all this, our party will wage an unceasing struggle. Our party congress will illustrate this.

    "First of all, we will build a stronger Communist Party from this congress onward."

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 27th: The Chinese Communist Party delegation composed of Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Wu Xiuquan, member of the Central Committee, left here by plane at 10:00 this morning for London. They were invited to attend the 26th National Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain, which opened today. Also traveling on the same plane to attend the congress was the Polish United Workers' Party delegation headed by Edward Gierek, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    Muralewski, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Tytkow, member of the Central Committee, and others saw them off at the airport. Wang Bingnan, Chinese Ambassador to Poland, also saw them off at the airport.

    英共代表大会开幕
    加拉赫说要建设更强大的共产党
    中共代表团已前往伦敦参加大会
    新华社伦敦27日电　英国共产党第二十六次代表大会今天上午在这里开幕。
    共产党名誉主席威廉·加拉赫在致开幕词时把社会主义国家的巨大进展同奄奄一息的资本主义下的国家作了一番对比。他说，在资本主义国家内，有一千万或一千二百万人失业，只有短期工作的还不算在内，这意味着有真正大规模的悲惨和苦难现象。他说，这些国家的垄断资本集团为了进行争夺市场的斗争，彼此都想切断对方的咽喉。他说，同资本主义国家这种情况对比，苏联的七年计划、中国的大跃进以及每一个社会主义国家的大踏步发展都说明社会主义国家在大步前进。他说，
  “我们到处可以看到改变世界的力量在前进”。
    加拉赫接着说：“一个患病的制度的患病的代理人不想死。在他们得到毁灭世界的机会之前，组织起来的工人阶级必须把他们送终。这是我们的世界——人民的世界，这不是一小撮疯狂的资本家的私人财产。我们一定要保全这个世界。”
    加拉赫批评工党的右翼领袖说：“工党在1918年发表了一个文件：‘劳工和新的社会秩序’，文件说，工党不会帮助资本主义复活，相反的，它将尽一切力量来埋葬资本主义”。
    “在四十年后的今天，右翼非但没有进行埋葬的工作，反而打算要比保守党更有效地实行资本主义。这是对我们先驱的可耻的背叛。我们的党一定要把劳工运动从资本主义的泥坑中挽救出来，使它回到社会主义的安全可靠的道路上来。”
    在谈到国际局势时，加拉赫指出英国人民被人拖着在杜勒斯和阿登纳的战争边缘政策的危险道路行走的危险性。他警告说：“拼命想挽救患病的旧制度的患病的老人可能变得非常危险，所以我们决不能放松为争取和平谈判和使疯子受到有效的控制而进行的斗争。”他在谈到中非人民争取独立的斗争时说，现在是英国离开那里，并且让他们有机会为他们自己做些事情的时候了。加拉赫赞扬了在上次党代表大会以前、会议期间以及以后的风浪里站稳立场的那些党员。他说，
  “我们向我们的敌人表明，谎言和诽谤不能使牢固地建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的我们的党离开英国走向社会主义的道路。”
    加拉赫在结束他的开幕词时说，“让我们从这次代表大会起以将会打破两党对议会的垄断的精神来迎接未来的选举！
    “我们必须重新建立工人对伟大的和光荣的社会主义和共产主义的信心。为了和平，为了人类的进步，为了国内工人阶级的团结，为了同殖民地国家我们兄弟们的团结，为了无产阶级国际主义，为了所有这一切，我们党将进行永不停止的斗争。我们党的代表大会将说明这一点。
    “首先，我们将从这次代表大会起建设一个更强大的共产党。”
    新华社华沙27日电　由中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记王稼祥、中央委员伍修权组成的中国共产党代表团，今天上午十时乘飞机离开这里前往伦敦。他们是应邀参加今天开幕的英国共产党第二十六次全国代表大会的。同机前往参加大会的，还有以波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员格雷克为首的波兰统一工人党代表团。
    到机场送行的有，波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员莫拉夫斯基、中央委员蒂特科夫等。中国驻波兰大使王炳南也到机场送行。
