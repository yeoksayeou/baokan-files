A little chat on past and present
Xie Juezai

Let me tell you a story, also a joke.

In my hometown, there was a famous *juren* (successful candidate in the imperial examination), and I read his eight-legged essay when he passed the examination. The topic was: "The Master said: 'If a *gu* is not a *gu*, is it a *gu* indeed?'"

A *gu* is a wine vessel. Confucius saw that the wine vessels of the time were different from the ancient wine vessels, so he couldn't help but sigh and say, "If a *gu* is not a *gu*, is it a *gu* indeed!" The "ti bi" (introductory section) of this *juren*'s essay had these sentences:

"The Winter Official's book has many omissions, but the *zhi* holds three *sheng*, which can be traced back to the wise system of a dynasty. Scholars study the past, and they eagerly wish to see the standards of the former kings and join this world in reversing the decline..." (Note)

Just imagine: everyone going to the museum to see those crude things like bronze wine vessels, bronze food vessels, and pottery pots and jars, could "join this world in reversing the decline," and even make warmongers not want to engage in aggressive wars. Wouldn't that be a big joke! This is not only being obsessed with the past but also mystifying it. However, even I once believed these words, and that was only sixty years ago.

Let me tell another story, also a recent one.

When I was a child, I read the Five Classics and particularly loved the *Zuo Zhuan*. Although I didn't understand it much, I felt it was easier to read than the *Book of Poetry*, *Book of Documents*, and *Book of Changes*. After leaving private school, I hadn't flipped through it for almost sixty years. I often thought I would have a chance to read it again. Recently, I found a woodblock-printed *Zuo Zhuan*, the same edition I read as a child, and after reading it once, I felt relieved and no longer missed it.

The concept my private school teacher gave me: kings (the Three Kings) were superior to hegemons (the Five Hegemons), the Spring and Autumn period was better than the Warring States period, which is the law that the past is better than the present. In fact, the *Zuo Zhuan* is only a record of a group of savage local tyrants and gentry fighting for land, plundering wealth, snatching women, raping, killing, enticing to kill, eating people (literally eating), using people to sacrifice to ghosts... and so on, not to mention the cruelty to the common people. Many things that violated the basic nature of humanity were rare in later generations but were very prevalent at that time. As for Confucius's one-word praise, one-word criticism, and "Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and rebellious officials and thieves were afraid," those are just deceptive nonsense.

Secondly, it is said that Zuo Qiuming wrote well. True, there are some good articles. In an era when writing tools were not yet perfect, it was valuable and worth emulating to be able to collect many historical facts and record them in concise sentences. But judged solely on the writing, many articles are not well-written. Even the good ones are limited by the times. Without objectively good facts and lofty ideals, it is impossible to write articles that will be recited by people forever; if there are any, they are only fragments.

Venerating the past and belittling the present is a method used by the exploiting classes to maintain their rule and prevent the people from progressing. Over time, it cultivates a kind of inertia, that is, servility, especially among intellectuals, who always think that each generation is worse than the last and that one should venerate the past. When imperialism came, they felt that everything about black hair and flat noses was inferior to yellow hair and high noses, and one should "venerate foreigners." Accustomed to being slaves, they seem unable to live without slave owners. Laboring people who have not been subjected to slave training do not think this way. Therefore, people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act always come from among them.

Venerating the past and venerating foreigners are not innate. In the past, learning from the past with a superstitious attitude and learning from foreigners with a superstitious attitude naturally made everything from the past and from foreign countries seem good. If we change to learning from the past and from foreign countries with a critical attitude, then it will be a completely different matter. In this way, we may be able to learn some truly good and useful things there. People who venerate the past and venerate foreigners, after knowing about the "present" and the "local," and then revisiting the past and foreign countries, like me rereading the *Zuo Zhuan*, may find it a bit beneficial.

(Note) "Ti bi" is a part of the eight-legged essay. This paragraph is the standard tune of the eight-legged essay.

    小谈今古
    谢觉哉
    讲个故事，也是个笑话。
    我乡有一位有名的举人，我读过他中举的八股文。题是：“子曰：觚不觚，觚哉觚哉”。
    觚是酒器，孔子看到当时的酒器和古时的酒器不一样，于是不胜其感慨地说：“觚不觚，觚哉觚哉！”这位举人文章的“提比”有这么几句：
    “冬官一册多阙文，然觯受三升，可溯一代圣明之制。儒生读书稽古，雅愿睹前王矩矱，与斯世共挽浇漓……”（注）
    试想：大家到博物陈列馆去看看那些铜酒器，铜食器，瓦钵子罐子等粗劣的东西，就可以“与斯世共挽浇漓”，甚至于可以使战争贩子也不想搞侵略战争了。岂非天大笑话！这不仅是迷古，而且是把古神秘化了。然而这些话连我也曾信过，这还不过是六十年前的事。
    再讲一个故事，也是个近事。
    我小时候读五经，颇爱左传，虽然并不大懂，但觉得它比诗、书、易好读。出了私塾差不多有六十年没有翻它了。常想有机会再读一读。最近找到了一册木板左传，即我小时读过的本子，读一遍之后，如释重负，再也不留恋它了。
    小时塾师给我的概念：王（三王）胜于霸（五霸），春秋比战国好，也即是古比今好的定律。实则一部左传，只是一群野蛮的土豪劣绅之间抢土地、抢财宝、抢妇女、奸杀、诱杀、吃人（当真吃）、用人祭鬼……等等的记载，更不要说对老百姓（庶人）的残酷了。有很多违反人类起码的本性的事，后世已经罕见，而当时则很盛行。至于孔子的一字之褒、一字之贬、“孔子作春秋而乱臣贼子惧”，更是骗人的鬼话。
    其次是说左丘明的文章做得好。不错，文章是有几篇好的，在文字工具尚不完善的时代，能够搜集很多史实，用简练的句子记载下来，是可贵的，值得效法的。但就文论文，写得不好的也不少。就是好的，又为时代所限制。没有客观好的事实和高尚的理想，不可能写出永远为人传诵的文章来，有，也只是片言只语。
    厚古薄今，是剥削阶级为维护自己的统治，不许人民进步的手法。久而久之，特别是在知识分子中养成一种惰性，也即是奴性，总以为一代不如一代，应该厚古。帝国主义来了，又觉得黑头发、平鼻子事事不如黄头发、高鼻子，又应该“厚洋”。作奴隶惯了，没有奴隶主，好像不能生活似的。没有受过奴隶训练的劳动人民，不这样想。所以敢想、敢说、敢做的人，总是出在他们中间。
      厚古、厚洋，并不是生成的。从前以迷信古的心情去学古，迷信洋的心情去学洋，自然甚么都是古的、洋的好。如果改变以批判的心情去学古、学洋，那就完全是另外一回事了。这样，可能在那里可以学得一些真好的可用的东西。厚古、厚洋的人在知道了“今”和“土”以后，再去温习下古和洋，像我重读左传一样，可能有点好处。
    （注）“提比”是八股文的一股。这里的一段，是八股文的标准调子。
