    Xinhui - A Green City
    Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, is carrying out landscaping construction centered on production, which not only helps develop production but also creates a magnificent environment of greening, beautification, and fragrance.

    This Xinhui County, located in the Pearl River Delta, proposed the "Four Transformations" slogan in 1954: "Rice paddies become granaries, rivers become fish ponds, barren mountains become fruit mountains, and rural areas become gardens." Last year, it further moved towards the direction of "production landscaping, landscaping production." The areas that were the focus of landscaping last year—towns, villages, roads, embankments, and barren mountains—have now taken on a new look. More than 1,300 kilometers of highways and village roads in the county are lined with trees. Along the 54-kilometer main highway, a river channel several meters wide has been dug on both sides. Six rows of ornamental trees, fan palms, and fruit trees are planted on the embankments on both sides of the channel, and short-term crops such as purple eggplants, golden vegetables, and beans are planted on the slopes. The river channel is used for irrigation, transportation, and fish farming. This not only beautifies the natural environment but also generates a substantial income every year. Of the county's more than 1,000 kilometers of embankments, 600 kilometers have been planted with swamp cypress, bamboo, willow, fan palms, and bananas. Guifeng Mountain, a demonstration area for landscaping barren mountains, has seen the emergence of large areas of timber forests, fruit tree forests, oil tea forests, and tea and medicinal herb forests. In addition, short-term crops such as sugarcane, pineapple, and castor beans are planted, and a large number of poultry and livestock are raised. This formerly barren mountain is now not only full of poetic and picturesque scenery, but also generated more than 100,000 yuan in income last year. Huidong Town, which was destroyed into a ruin by the Japanese invaders, has now been built into a city that is green year-round and full of flowers and fruits; the market towns of various communes and some villages are also adorned with fruit trees, bananas, fan palms, green bamboo, and trees, making them colorful.

    A major characteristic of Xinhui County's landscaping work is that it starts from production and implements the principle of "adapting to local conditions and comprehensive utilization," combining greening, beautification, fragrance, and production. Therefore, this not only achieves "landscaping supports landscaping, production supports scenery," but also continuously accumulates to consolidate and expand landscaping construction.

    Currently, the practical experience of beautifying the mountains and rivers and obtaining huge economic benefits in the various landscaping demonstration areas in the county is guiding the broad masses to further engage in large-scale landscaping. They propose to strive for "self-sufficiency in timber in six years, inexhaustible bamboo in four years, woody oil materials in seven years, free fruit consumption in two years, and everyone living in a large garden this year."

    新会——绿色的城市
    广东省新会县以生产为中心开展园林化建设，既有助于发展生产，又创造了绿化、美化和香化的瑰丽环境。
    这个位于珠江三角洲的新会县，在1954年就提出“稻田变谷仓、河流变鱼塘、荒山变果山、农村变花园”的“四变”口号。去年更进一步向“生产园林化、园林生产化”的方向迈进。在去年重点开始园林化的地区——城镇、村庄、道路、围堤和荒山，现在已出现新的面貌。全县一千三百多公里公路和村庄大道已经林木成行。全长五十四公里的主干公路，两旁边开了一条宽几公尺的河道，河道两旁的堤上共栽上六行风景树、蒲葵和果树，边坡还种上紫茄、金菜和豆类等短期作物，河道则用来灌溉、运输和养鱼。不仅美化了自然环境，而且今后每年还可有大笔收入。全县一千多公里围堤，已有六百公里种上水松、竹、柳、葵和香蕉等。荒山园林化的示范区——圭峰山，已出现成片的用材林、果树林、油茶林和茶叶、药材林等，另外，还种上甘蔗、菠萝、蓖麻等短期作物，加上养了大批禽畜，这座原来的荒山现在不仅充满诗情画意，而且去年就已经有了十万多元的收入。过去被日本侵略者破坏成废圩般的会城镇，现在已建成一座终年穿红披绿和花卉、果木纷繁的城市；各公社的圩镇和部分村庄也被果树、香蕉、蒲葵、绿竹和林木点缀得千紫万红。
    新会县开展园林化工作的重大特点是从生产出发，贯彻“因地制宜、综合利用”的原则，使绿化、美化、香化、生产化相结合，因此，这不仅达到了“园林养园林，生产养风景”，而且还不断有积累来巩固和扩大园林化建设。
    目前，这个县的各个园林化示范区美化了山河面貌和获得巨大经济效益的实践经验，正在引导着广大群众进一步大搞园林绿化；他们提出，要力争“六年后木材自给，四年竹子用不完，七年油料木本化，两年吃果不要钱，今年人人住在大花园”。
