    Holding a New-Style Rice Seedling Training Class
    This year, the Jinguo Commune in Wuning County, Jiangxi Province, has completely converted all its rice seedling fields to the new style. The commune transferred thirty-seven members from various production teams to set up a new-style rice seedling training class. First, they made everyone aware of the advantages of new-style rice seedling fields over the old style, and then they learned techniques such as land preparation and sowing.
                                                                                  (Yao Tanghao)

    办新式秧田训练班
    江西武宁县巾国公社今年把秧田全改成新式秧田。公社从各生产队调出三十七名社员，开办了新式秧田训练班，首先使大家认识新式秧田比旧式秧田的好处，然后学习整田和播种等技术。	　　　　（姚唐豪）
