Deep Friendship on Mount Wuyi
By Our Correspondent Mei Guobao

In the spring of 1958, sixteen young cadres from the directly subordinate organs of Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, were sent to Yangjiapai, a small village in the Wuyi Mountains. This group received a warm welcome upon their arrival. The first words the villagers said to them were: "Chairman Mao has sent you to help us build the mountain area!" Ai Songlin, a veteran of the Red Army, immediately cleaned his two rooms and offered them as dormitories for the cadres. The villagers also quickly brought bed boards and straw. The next day, under the guidance of Xiao Shengxue, the production team leader of the village's agricultural cooperative, they began to find barren hills and open up wasteland, working as if they were back in their hometowns.

Yangjiapai, formerly part of the Minbei Soviet area in the Wuyi Mountains, has a total of eleven households. The village mainly produces tea, with more than 300 mu of tea gardens, yielding three to four thousand catties of tea annually. Due to the scarcity of labor, the tea gardens were more than they could handle, and they always had to hire people from the foot of the mountain to help from January to May. If they missed the season, the tender tea leaves, which could have been made into the nationally famous "Wuyi Rock Tea," would turn into ordinary leaves.

In the blink of an eye, it was May when Shi Yougui and the others arrived at Yangjiapai. At this time, Yangjiapai seemed particularly tense. This was partly because the tea-picking season had arrived, but more importantly because a vigorous production campaign was underway at the foot of the mountain, and there was a shortage of labor, with no one able to spare time to help with the tea picking. The entire tea-picking task had to be completed by themselves. However, with only a dozen or so laborers in the whole village, and with five people having to be left to take charge of transplanting rice seedlings and planting corn, there were fewer than ten people left. With so much tea and so little labor, and the season so tight, how could they not be tense? The Wuyi Mountains were already rainy, but the rain at this time poured down like the Yellow River after a levee break. Anxious and uneasy emotions appeared on the faces of the people of Yangjiapai. Just at this moment, Shi Yougui and the others, having just finished planting corn, learned about this situation and decided to change their original production plan, postponing the work of cutting thatch bamboo and concentrating all their efforts on helping the masses with the rush harvesting of spring tea. The news spread, and the masses were greatly encouraged.

As soon as the rush tea picking began, Shi Yougui and Xiao Shengxue, the production team leader of the cooperative, led the cadres and the masses, respectively, and appeared in the high mountains every day. In order to further encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses, they also organized red flag competitions. The enthusiasm of the masses was even higher. The mountain trails were both slippery and hard, and the cadres sent down were not used to walking on such roads, and they would fall accidentally. The small Wang Aishun often slipped and rolled down the hillside, looking like a mud bodhisattva, but she did not complain at all, got up after falling, and continued to pick tea leaves. The rain seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for people, pouring down relentlessly, and the mountain wind was strong, so there was no way to hold an umbrella. So they didn't hold umbrellas and picked tea leaves on the mountain with their heads bare. For more than ten days, their clothes were often dry at night and wet during the day. While picking tea, their bodies were constantly soaked as if they were immersed in water. Xiao Shengxue, the production team leader of the cooperative, felt sorry for them and sent raincoats several times, but Shi Yougui refused them.

In more than ten days, Shi Yougui and the other sixteen cadres helped the masses pick more than 100 mu of tea leaves. Yangjiapai successfully completed the tea-picking task.

After the spring tea was picked, Shi Yougui and the others were in a hurry to go to a very distant mountain to cut thatch bamboo, and they forgot that the corn they had planted had not yet been weeded for the first time. 社员肖来生 社员肖来生 told the team leader about this situation. After discussion, everyone formed groups of three or five and spent more than two days weeding the cadres' cornfields. Where the seedlings had come loose, they carefully replanted corn seedlings transplanted from their own fields, making the cornfields neat and clean. A few days later, the cadres returned, and Shi Yougui and several comrades, carrying hoes, ran to the cornfields. But when they arrived at one plot of land, the weeds had been cleared; when they arrived at another plot of land, the weeds had also been cleared. They walked all over the cornfields they had planted and did not find a single plot of land with weeds. The corn plants grew green and tender, slender and graceful, and were very pleasing. This unexpected new situation puzzled them for a while. Who was the kind-hearted person who had helped them so much?

One night, after finishing cultural lessons, Shi Yougui, on behalf of all the cadres sent down, thanked the people of Yangjiapai for the corn weeding. He said excitedly: If it weren't for everyone helping to weed the cornfields, the corn would have been overwhelmed by the weeds. We guarantee that we will cultivate the corn well in the future and strive for a bumper harvest to thank you all. As soon as he finished speaking, the villager Xiao Laisheng stood up and said: What does it matter if we help you weed a little? You help us learn culture, treat our illnesses, and risk your lives to help us pick tea leaves. There are many other things that I can't even remember. We really want to thank you! Everyone was discussing it enthusiastically. At this time, Ai Songlin, a veteran of the Red Army who was sitting on the side, also spoke. He said: "Everyone, don't argue. It's right for the cadres to help us, and it's right for us to help the cadres. This is called fish helping water, water helping fish. Is everyone right?" His words made everyone laugh, and then continuous applause and laughter broke through the silent mountains. (Attached photo)

    武夷山上情谊深
    本报记者　梅国宝
    1958年的春天，江西省上饶地、专直属机关的青年干部施有贵等十六人，下放到了武夷山上的一个小村子杨家排。这伙人一到杨家排就受到热烈的欢迎，群众同他们见面的第一句话就是：“毛主席派你们来帮助我们建设山区啦！”红军老战士艾松林立即把自己的两间房子打扫的干干净净，让出来给干部作寝室。群众也很快就送来了铺板和稻草。第二天他们便在这个村子的农业社生产小组长肖胜学的指引下，找荒山、开荒地，就像回到家乡一样搞起生产来了。
    杨家排原属武夷山闽北苏区，共有十一户人家。这个村子以产茶为主，全村共有三百多亩茶林，每年可收三、四千斤茶叶。由于劳动力少，茶林多，1到5月便忙不过来，总要到山下请一些人来帮忙。要是错过了季节，本来可以制成全国闻名的“武夷岩茶”的嫩茶，就会变成树叶子。
    施有贵等十六人到杨家排，一转眼就到了5月。这时，杨家排显得特别紧张；这虽然是由于摘茶的季节到了，更主要的是山下正在开展轰轰烈烈的生产运动，劳力不足，没有人能挤出时间到山上帮助采茶，整个采茶任务全要自己完成。但是全村只有十几个劳动力，除了必须留五个人负责插秧、种玉米以外。剩下的就不到十个人，茶多人少，季节又紧，怎么能不紧张。本来就是多雨的武夷山，这时的雨又像决了口的黄河水一样，不断地往下落。焦急不安的情绪在杨家排人们的脸上出现了。就在这个时候，施有贵等刚刚种完玉米，一了解到这个情况，他们便决定改变原来的生产计划，把砍伐茅竹的工作推迟一步，集中全力帮助群众突击采摘春茶。消息一传开，群众大为振奋。
    突击摘茶一开始，下放干部施有贵和社的生产组长肖胜学便分别带领着干部和群众，整天出现在崇山峻岭中。为了进一步鼓舞群众的生产热情，他们还组织了红旗竞赛。群众的情绪更高涨起来了。山区的羊肠小道是既滑又硬，下放干部们没有习惯走这种路，一不小心，就会跌倒。小个子王爱顺是经常滑倒在山坡上打滚滚，弄的像个泥菩萨，但她没有叫苦一声，跌倒了就爬起来，继续摘茶叶。雨像故意与人们为难似的，一个劲儿往下落，加上山风又大，根本就没有办法撑伞，他们便不撑伞，光着头在山上摘茶叶。十几天中，他们的衣服经常是黑夜干、白天湿。在采茶的时候，他们的身上一直就像浸在水中一样。社里的生产小组长肖胜学过意不去，几次送来了蓑衣，但都被施有贵拒绝了。
    十几天中，施有贵等十六个干部帮助群众采摘了一百多亩茶叶。杨家排胜利地完成了摘茶任务。
    春茶摘完以后，施有贵等急着到一座很远的山头上去砍茅竹，他们忘记了种上的玉米还没有锄第一次草。社员肖来生将这一情况告诉了小组长。大家一商量，便三人一帮，五人一伙，在二天多的时间里，把干部玉米田里的草都锄了；脱了蔸的地方，他们很细心地补栽上从自己田里移来的玉米苗，一丘丘的玉米地弄的整整齐齐、干干净净。不几天干部回来了，施有贵和几个同志，肩着锄头就往玉米地跑；可是到一丘地草被锄光了，到另一丘地，草也是被锄光了。他们走遍他们所种的玉米地，没有发现一丘地里有草；一棵棵的玉米长的又青又嫩，亭亭玉立，很是讨人欢喜。这种意想不到的新情况，一时把他们弄得莫明其妙。是那些好心肠的人帮了他们这样一个大忙呢？
    在一个夜晚，上完了文化课以后，施有贵为了玉米草的事，代表全体下放干部向杨家排的人们致谢。他很激动地说：要不是大家帮助把玉米地里的草锄掉，玉米就会让草压死了。我们保证今后一定把玉米培植好，争取个大丰收，来感谢大家。他的话刚一落音，社员肖来生便站了起来，他说：我们帮你们锄点草算得什么，你们帮我们学文化、治病，还拼着命抢着帮我们摘茶叶，还有许多，我都记不清楚了。我们才真要好好地谢谢你们呢！大家都在热烈地议论着。这时坐在一边的老红军艾松林也说话了，他说：“大家都不要争论了。干部帮助我们，我们帮助干部，都是应该的，这叫做鱼帮水、水帮鱼，大家说对不对？”他的话把大家说得哈哈大笑起来，接着，连续不断的掌声、笑声冲破了这寂静的山林。（附图片）
