Five Children's Songs
    Liu Raomin

    Smashing Ore
    Little hammer, smashing rocks,
    Smashing them all into little fists.
    Smashing quickly, smashing a lot,
    Cars haul them, trains drag them.
    Smashing a lot, smashing well,
    Letting the iron smelting furnace eat its fill.
    Eating its fill, the iron flows long,
    The surging waves push the front waves...

    Golden Hoe
    Golden hoe, silver hoe,
    Can't compare to my little hoe.
    First hoeing the millet, then hoeing the beans,
    Hoeing the wheat, then hoeing the taro.
    Millet ears grow nine yards, nine feet;
    One bean grain holds a peck.
    Wheat grows ten stories high;
    One taro fills the Yellow River to the brim!
    Little hoe, truly good,
    With it, the earth offers treasures with both hands.
    Little hoe, priceless,
    With it, treasures everywhere, you can't finish taking them!

    Manure Accumulation Tide Like a Sea Tide
    Young Pioneers are heroes,
    Manure accumulation tide like a sea tide,
    Younger siblings carrying in pairs,
    Older siblings carrying alone,
    During the day, the Sun Grandpa smiles,
    At night, the Moon Grandma shines,
    Accumulating manure piles higher than Mount Tai,
    Mount Tai is not as tall as the sorghum stalk!

    Harvesting Salt
    The salt pond is dry, time to harvest salt!
    Sweeping, sweeping clean,
    Lifting, running quickly,
    Each salt pond is swept clean,
    Each salt mountain is piled up,
    Salt mountain big, salt mountain high,
    White clouds float underfoot,
    Head touches the sun's waist,
    Uncles are happy, aunts are smiling,
    The old commune leader says loudly:
    "Little girls have contributed too!"

    Delivering Tea
    Sky is blue, clouds are floating,
    Uncles in the commune are transplanting rice seedlings.
    Carrying pole bends, earthenware pot is big,
    I'm delivering tea to the uncles.
    Crossing the canal, crossing the small bridge,
    Carp jumping in the ditch.
    Crossing the small bridge, going up the field ridge,
    Ten thousand acres of rice seedlings, a stretch of green.
    Tea is fragrant, tea is sweet,
    Uncles drink it and are even more capable.
    Water sound rings, sweat drips,
    Transplanting a hundred acres of rice in one day!

    儿歌五首
    刘饶民砸矿石小鎯头，砸石头，砸的都像小拳头。砸的快，砸的多，汽车拉了火车拖。砸的多，砸的好，让炼铁炉吃个饱。吃饱了，铁流长，滚滚后浪推前浪……
    金锄头金锄头，银锄头，比不过我的小锄头。先锄谷，后锄豆，锄了麦子锄芋头。谷穗长，九丈九；一个豆粒盛一斗。麦子高，十层楼；一个芋头塞断黄河流！小锄头，实在好，有了它大地双手献元宝。小锄头，金不换，有了它遍地元宝取不完！
    积肥热潮似海潮少先队员是英豪，积肥热潮似海潮，弟弟妹妹两人担，哥哥姐姐单人挑，白天太阳公公笑，黑夜月亮婆婆照，积得肥堆比泰山高，泰山高不到高粱腰！
    收盐盐池干了，来收盐了。扫呀扫干净，抬呀快步跑，一个个盐池扫完了，一座座盐山堆成了，盐山大，盐山高，脚下白云飘，头碰太阳腰，伯伯们喜，叔叔们笑，老社长大声说：
  “小妞也有功劳！”
    送茶天蓝蓝，云飘飘，社里叔叔耥稻苗。扁担弯，瓦罐大，我给叔叔来送茶。跨渠道，过小桥，水沟里边鲤鱼跳。过小桥，上田埂，万亩稻苗一片青。茶水香，茶水甜，叔叔喝了更能干。水声响，汗珠掉，一天耥完百亩稻！
