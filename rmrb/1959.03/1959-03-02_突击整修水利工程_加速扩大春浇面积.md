    Rush Repairs on Water Conservancy Projects
    Accelerate Expansion of Spring Irrigation Area
    Shanxi
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 1st dispatch) Shanxi Province is stepping up the repair of existing water conservancy projects to put them into spring irrigation as soon as possible and enable them to play a role during spring plowing and sowing.
    At present, from the Jinnan Plain to outside Yanmen Pass, the preparatory activities to welcome a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture have been launched in full swing throughout Shanxi Province. In order to rapidly expand the spring irrigation area, people's communes in various places have universally organized a certain number of laborers to repair water conservancy projects and water lifting tools, according to local water conservancy conditions and labor conditions. In Jinbei area, where water conservancy conditions are poor, forces were organized as early as January to repair water conservancy projects. At present, there are more than 4,800 various water conservancy projects completed and under construction in the whole area. After the completion of these projects, more than 3 million mu of basic farmland will become "disaster-free in heavy rain and guaranteed harvest without rain." The Jin Southeast Special District is expanding water sources by repairing original water conservancy projects and farmland irrigation projects, and at the same time adopting measures such as digging springs, chiseling springs at the bottom of wells, combining streams for long-distance irrigation, and using topography to build temporary small reservoirs. Wenxi County in Jinan not only actively stores water, but also actively solves water lifting equipment. Now all 40 projects without water lifting tools in the county have been installed with water lifting equipment.
    Repairing and consolidating existing water conservancy projects is a new measure determined by Shanxi Province based on the new situation of the great development of water conservancy projects since the great leap forward in agriculture. According to the experience of various places over the years and the current phenomenon of less rain and snow and drought, giving full play to the efficiency of existing projects and tapping the potential of original equipment are quick, efficient, and economical measures. After inspecting the benefits of water conservancy projects, Xilu People's Commune in the suburbs of Yuci City found that some projects lacked channels and farmland projects. They immediately organized forces to carry out a blitz. Each management area also universally leveled land, sorted out old channels, deepened old wells, and processed and repaired original dams and channels. After doing so, this year's spring irrigation area greatly exceeded the actual irrigation area of the original project. The Hongshan Irrigation Area in Jiexiu County has abundant water sources, but some cultivated land cannot be supplied with water due to the lack of field irrigation projects. After repairing more than 78,000 mu of field projects, the irrigation efficiency has doubled.

    Hunan
    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 1st dispatch) Hunan Province has completed the repair and construction of more than 90,000 reservoirs, ponds and other projects. Now, all localities are conducting a comprehensive inspection of the completed water conservancy projects in conjunction with the great inspection of preparation for cultivation to ensure that the finishing work is done well. According to incomplete statistics from Changde and Hengyang Special Districts and Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, 226 water conservancy inspection and acceptance teams headed by party committees at all levels were established, and thousands of water conservancy projects were inspected and accepted on the spot. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently transferred cadres from relevant provincial departments to form groups to go to more than 100 medium-sized reservoir construction sites with dam heights of more than 25 meters throughout the province to cooperate with cadres from special and county levels to conduct engineering quality inspections.
    The general quality inspection of water conservancy projects in various places is carried out in combination with the method of party committees taking the lead, mobilizing the masses to inspect, repair, accept, store water, and establish water use management systems at the same time. Xining County recently transferred more than 100 cadres to form 13 inspection teams to inspect the 93 completed reservoir projects in the county. It was found that the quality of 7 reservoirs did not meet the standards, and more than 15,000 members were immediately mobilized to repair them, reinforce the dam foundation, and open spillways. The inspection team of the Shaodong County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently discovered at the Mawangchong Reservoir construction site that this medium-sized reservoir, which can irrigate more than 30,000 mu of farmland, would take more than 50 days to complete according to the current manpower and work efficiency. They immediately helped the construction site reform tools, improve work efficiency, and the number of workers increased from 1,600 to 3,000. As a result, the reservoir can be guaranteed to be completed within 30 days.
    Due to the large-scale tool reform on water conservancy construction sites, the use of labor this year has been reduced, work efficiency has been improved, and the quality is better than in previous years. (Hu Jian)
    Yunnan
    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 1st dispatch)
  The existing and under construction large, medium and small water conservancy projects in Yunnan have generally stored water. Up to now, in addition to more than 5 million mu of wheat being watered twice, the province has stored more than 6 billion cubic meters of water for spring rice, cotton and other cash crops, which is one and a half times that of the same period last year. If calculated at 400 cubic meters of water per mu, it can irrigate 15 million mu of farmland, which is about a quarter of the province's cultivated land area.
    In order to enable water conservancy projects to store water before spring plowing, all localities have generally implemented the provincial party committee's instructions on first concentrating efforts to repair projects that will benefit this year and constructing and storing water at the same time. They have also mobilized the masses to start early to repair ditches and build dams, and seize the favorable opportunity of rain to irrigate and store winter water. In addition to irrigating 120,000 mu of wheat fields two to three times, Qujing Special District has accumulated a large amount of water for more than 2.2 million mu of rice fields. In order to ensure the use of water for spring crops, the Qujing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently stipulated that the current use of water for minor spring crops should be solved by extracting groundwater and diverting perennial water. Because Minle Commune in Jinggu County repaired ditches and dams early, more than 900 ditches were filled with water by the end of last year. In January of this year, they used rainwater to fill all 64 dams and ponds in the commune.
    Dali, Yangbi, Fengyi and Xiaguan, four counties and cities in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, paid attention to improving the engineering quality of reservoirs. The dam bodies of reservoirs in these counties and cities are all built on solid and reliable foundations. The reservoir culverts are mostly built in tunnels under the mountains next to the dam, avoiding water erosion in the area where the dam body and the culvert are combined. (Chen Weigeng)
    Gansu
    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 1st dispatch)
  The people of Gansu are repairing and reinforcing various water conservancy projects with greater efforts than last year's "diverting water to the mountains." At present, the repaired reservoirs, ponds, and canal projects can guarantee spring irrigation for 14 million mu of cultivated land; the newly built water conservancy storage projects in various places can store more than 170 million cubic meters of water. According to the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee, 60% of the province's planned 50 million mu of cultivated land will be generally irrigated before the end of spring sowing.
    In order to give full play to the maximum irrigation benefits of water conservancy construction, Gansu has adopted the following main measures: Communes and teams generally establish water conservancy professional teams, first repair channels with small projects and quick results, and store water while building storage projects, implementing a responsibility system with division of labor; combine canal irrigation, and break ice for spring irrigation, which can reduce leakage, prevent freezing, and increase water volume; various places train a large number of technicians to improve irrigation technology to avoid wasting water; water conservancy construction sites universally carry out high work efficiency campaigns, greatly improving work efficiency and accelerating the progress of water conservancy projects.

    Shandong
    (Our newspaper, Jinan, 1st dispatch)
  Since last winter, Shandong Province has had more than 3 million water conservancy troops fighting for water. Now the province's farmland water storage has increased from more than 20 billion cubic meters last year to more than 30 billion cubic meters. However, it still cannot meet the water demand for this spring; at the same time, due to the lack of water lifting tools, the existing water storage cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted five effective measures to rush to repair water conservancy facilities while carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement. The first is to arrange labor so that each commune generally uses 20% of its labor to strengthen the water conservancy professional team, striving to solve all the water used in the spring by the end of March, and basically solve the water used throughout the year in April and May. The second is to vigorously rush to repair and manufacture water lifting tools in order to give full play to the role of groundwater. The province plans to manufacture 2 million sets of simple water lifting tools by early April, including wooden windmill waterwheels, manual waterwheels, and animal-powered waterwheels. Third, combine spring plowing and wheat watering, leveling the land, repairing field embankments and ridged fields, and irrigating ditches and canals. Fourth, carry out technical reforms on water conservancy construction sites to achieve semi-mechanization of construction and improve labor efficiency. Finally, focus on soil and water conservation in mountainous areas.
    Now the high tide of water conservancy construction in Shandong Province is getting higher and higher. Party committees and people's communes at all levels have actively implemented the above five measures. Iron and wood workers in Yantai Special District have been mobilized to rush to repair water lifting tools. Since the Spring Festival, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Zhucheng, and Anqiu counties have manufactured more than 20,000 water lifting tools, developed some group wells (spring combinations), washed a large number of old wells, and most of the drainage and irrigation machinery has also returned to the team.

    突击整修水利工程
    加速扩大春浇面积
    山西
    本报太原1日电  山西省各地正在加紧整修现有水利工程，使其尽快投入春浇，并能在春耕播种期间发挥作用。
    目前，山西全省从晋南平原到雁门关外，迎接更大更好更全面农业大跃进的备耕活动，已经轰轰烈烈地展开。各地人民公社为了迅速扩大春浇面积，都根据当地水利条件、劳力情况，普遍组织一定数量的劳力整修水利工程和提水工具。水利条件较差的晋北地区，早在1月份即组织力量整修水利工程，目前全区已完成和正在动工的各种水利工程有四千八百多项，这些工程竣工后，将使三百多万亩基本农田成为“雨多不成灾、没雨保丰收”的水地。晋东南专区一面整修原有水利工程和田面灌溉工程，一面采取挖泉、井底凿泉、合流远浇和利用地形建筑临时小型蓄水池，积极扩大水源。晋南闻喜县不仅积极蓄水，还积极解决提水设备，现在全县四十项没有提水工具的工程已全部安装了提水设备。
    整修和巩固原有水利工程是山西省根据农业大跃进以来水利工程大发展的新情况，确定的新措施。根据各地历年的经验和当前雨雪少、出现干旱的现象，充分发挥现有工程效益，挖掘原有设备的潜力是见效快、效益大、又经济的措施。榆次市郊区西路人民公社经过检查水利工程受益情况，发现有些工程缺乏渠道和田面工程，立即组织力量突击，各管理区也普遍平整土地、整理旧渠道、挖深旧井、加工补修原有坝渠，这样做以后，今年的春季灌溉面积就大大超过了原来工程的实际灌溉面积。介休县洪山灌溉区水源很丰富，由于缺少田间灌溉工程，有些耕地送不到水，经过修整田面工程七万八千多亩，使灌溉效率提高了一倍。

    湖南
    本报长沙1日电湖南省已完成整修和新建水库、山塘等工程九万多处。现在，各地正结合备耕工作大检查，对已完成的水利工程，进行全面检查，保证做好煞尾工程。仅据常德、衡阳两专区和湘西土家族苗族自治州的不完全统计，由各级党委挂帅成立了二百二十六个水利检查验收小组，就地检查验收了好几千处水利工程。中共湖南省委最近从省级有关部门抽调干部分组赴全省一百多处坝高在二十五公尺以上的中型水库工地，配合各专、县干部进行工程质量检查。
    各地对水利工程质量大检查，是采取党委挂帅，发动群众边检查、边补修、边验收、边蓄水、边建立用水管理制度的办法结合进行的。新宁县最近抽调一百多名干部组成十三个检查组，检查全县已竣工的九十三处水库工程，发现七个水库质量不合标准，当即发动一万五千多名社员突击补修，加固坝基和开好溢洪道。中共邵东县委检查组最近在马王冲水库工地发现这个能灌田三万多亩的中型水库，按现有人力和工效要五十多天才能完工，当即帮助工地改革工具，提高工效，出工人数也由一千六百人增加到三千人，这一来，这个水库能保证在三十天内完工。
    由于水利工地大搞工具改革，今年用工减少，工效提高，质量亦较往年好。　（胡坚）
    云南
    本报昆明1日电
  云南现有的和正在兴建的大中小型水利工程，已普遍蓄上了水。到目前止，除了五百多万亩小麦浇了两次水以外，全省为大春的水稻、棉花及其它经济作物储备的水量已达六十多亿方，等于去年同期的一倍半。如以每亩浇四百方水计算，可以灌溉农田一千五百万亩，约等于全省耕地面积的四分之一。
    为了使水利工程能在春耕以前蓄满水，各地普遍执行了省委关于首先集中力量修好当年受益工程和边兴修、边蓄水的指示，同时发动群众及早动手修沟筑坝、抓紧下雨的有利时机灌蓄冬水。曲靖专区除了在十二万亩小麦田里灌溉了两次到三次水以外，并为二百二十多万亩稻田积蓄了大量的水。为了保证大春作物的用水，最近中共曲靖地委规定，目前小春用水一律提取地下水和引用长流水解决。景谷县民乐公社因为提早整修了沟坝，去年年底就使九百多条水沟都灌满了水。今年1月又利用雨水，把全社六十四个坝塘个个都灌满了。
    大理白族自治州大理、漾濞、凤仪和下关等四个县市注意了提高水库的工程质量。这几个县市的水库坝体都建筑在坚实可靠的基础上。水库涵洞大都筑在水坝旁边山下的隧洞里，避免了坝体与涵洞结合的部分受水浸蚀。　（陈渭庚）
    甘肃
    本报兰州1日电
  甘肃人民用比去年“引水上山”更大的干劲，整修加固各种水利工程。目前，修复的库、塘和渠道工程，可以保证一千四百万亩耕地春灌；各地新建水利蓄水工程可蓄水一亿七千多万公方。按照省委要求，在春播结束以前，全省计划播种的五千万亩耕地的60％，要普遍进行灌水。
    甘肃各地为充分发挥水利建设的最大灌溉效益，采用了以下几项主要措施：各公社、队普遍建立水利专业队，先修工程小、收效快的渠道，蓄水工程边修边灌，实行分工负责的责任制；合渠灌溉，破冰春灌，这样可以减少渗漏，防止冻结和增大水量；各地培训大批技术员，改进灌溉技术，以免浪费水；水利工地普遍开展高工效运动，大大提高了工作效率，使水利工程进度加快。　（翟其寅）
    山东
    本报济南1日电
  山东省从去冬以来，一直有三百多万水利大军为水而战，现在已使全省的农田蓄水量由去年的二百多亿公方，增加到三百多亿公方。但是仍然不能满足今年春季所需水量；同时由于缺乏提水工具，现有蓄水亦不能全部利用。因此中共山东省委在积肥运动的同时，采取了五项有效措施赶修水利。首先是安排劳力，使各公社大体以20％的劳力，加强水利专业队，争取3月底把春季用水全部解决，4、5月间基本解决全年用水。其次大力突击修制提水工具，以便充分发挥地下水的作用。全省计划在4月初，制造简易提水工具二百万套，其中包括木制风力水车、人力水车和畜力水车。第三，结合春耕浇麦，平整土地、修整地堰畦田、灌溉沟渠。第四，在水利工地上，大力进行技术改革，达到施工半机械化，提高劳动工效。最后在山区抓紧搞好水土保持。
    现在山东省的水利建设高潮越来越高。各级党委和人民公社都积极地贯彻了上述五项措施。烟台专区的铁木工人，已经都动员起来赶修提水工具。寿张、范县、诸城、安丘等四个县，在春节以后，已制造提水工具二万多部，并搞了一部分群井（泉组合），淘洗了大批的旧井，排灌机械也大部分归队了。
