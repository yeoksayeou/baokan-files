    All in Their Places
    In the spring of 1869, one day, Inostrantsev, the secretary of the Department of Physics and Mathematics of St. Petersburg University, went to visit his friend Mendeleev. As soon as he entered the door, he saw Mendeleev standing by his desk, looking depressed.
    "What are you busy with?" Inostrantsev asked with concern.
    Mendeleev then talked about the periodicity of the elements. He said, "Everything has been thought out, but a periodic table cannot be made yet."
    A few days later, Mendeleev was studying by his desk, trying to make a periodic table, without closing his eyes for three days and three nights, but this attempt was unsuccessful.
    Ninety years ago today, on March 1, 1869, the periodic law of elements was discovered by the great Russian scientist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev. This great discovery laid the foundation for modern science concerning the structure of matter and enabled the major development of science after the mid-nineteenth century.
    Chemical elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen exist individually in nature, but they are interconnected by common properties, becoming an inseparable whole. This concept had already emerged in the eighteenth century, and some scientists attempted to systematize the discovered chemical elements, but without success. Mendeleev arranged the then-discovered sixty-four chemical elements according to their natural properties (i.e., atomic weight), so that the seemingly "isolated" elements were all in their places, exhibiting significant periodicity. Mendeleev scientifically predicted that many unknown elements could be discovered in the future, and according to atomic weight, their properties could be predicted. Facts have proved that among the thirty-seven elements discovered after 1869, twenty-one were predicted by Mendeleev. The periodic table of elements clearly shows how significant the qualitative change resulting from quantitative change is in the history of natural development.
    Engels gave a high evaluation of Mendeleev's great discovery: "Mendeleev unconsciously applied Hegel's law of the transformation of quantity into quality and completed a scientific feat that can be compared to Leverrier's calculation of the orbit of the as-yet-unknown planet Neptune."

    各就各位
    1869年春季里，有一天，彼得堡大学物理数学系秘书依诺斯特兰采夫去拜访自己的好友门德列也夫。刚一进门，就见到门德列也夫站在写字台旁，神情带有郁闷。
    “您在忙什么呀？”依诺斯特兰采夫关心地问。
    门德列也夫就谈起了元素周期性。他说：“一切都已经想好了，可是还不能制成周期表。”
    过些天，门德列也夫在自己的写字台旁研究，试图制成元素周期表，一连三天三夜不曾合眼，但是，这个试图都没有成功。
    九十年前的今天，1869年3月1日元素周期律被俄国伟大科学家德米特里·伊凡诺维奇·门德列也夫发现了。这一伟大的发现，奠定了有关物质构造的近代科学的基础，使十九世纪中叶以后的科学得到重大的发展。
    化学元素如氢、氧、氮等在自然界中是个别地存在着，但它们以共同的性质相互联系着，成为不可分割的整体。这一概念早在十八世纪就产生了，并且有些科学家试图将已发现的化学元素加以系统化，但都没有成功。门德列也夫根据当时已发现的六十四种化学元素的自然性质（即原子量）排列起来，使表面上“孤立”的各种元素各就各位，表现出显著的周期性。门德列也夫科学地预言：将来还可以发现许多未知元素，并且根据原子量，可以预知它们的特性。事实证明，在1869年以后发现的三十七种元素中，就有二十一种是门德列也夫所预言过的。元素周期表清楚地表明，由量变而发生质变在自然发展史中有多么大的意义。
    恩格斯给予门德列也夫的伟大发现以崇高的评价：“门德列也夫不自觉地应用黑格尔的从量转化为质的规律，完成了科学上的一个勋业，这个勋业可与莱维利叶之计算尚未知道的海王星行星的轨道居于同等的地位。”（“自然辩证法”，人民出版社1955年版，第44页）
