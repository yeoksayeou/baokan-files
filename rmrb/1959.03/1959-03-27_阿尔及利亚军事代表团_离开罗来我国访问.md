    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 26th: The Algerian military delegation headed by Algerian Deputy Minister of State Omar Oussedik left Cairo this morning for Beijing. This nine-member delegation is visiting China at the invitation of Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China.
    In a written statement before departure, the delegation said that its visit to China was based on the friendly policy between the people and governments of the Republic of Algeria and the People's Republic of China. This friendly policy began when the government of the People's Republic of China recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria only a few days after its establishment. The statement said that the visit to China by the delegation of the Algerian Provisional Government led by Minister of Social Affairs Youssef Ben Khedda and Minister of Armaments and Supplies Mahmoud Cherif in December last year strengthened the friendly ties between the great Chinese people and the struggling Algerian people.
    The statement said that for five years, the Algerian people, armed with weapons, have been waging a difficult battle against the French oppressors.
    The Algerian people must carry on the struggle for national independence to the end.
    Algerian Minister of Social Affairs Ben Khedda and Minister of Finance and Economy Ahmed Francis saw the delegation off at the airport. Lin Zhaonan, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the United Arab Republic, and Military Attaché Li Dazhong also saw the delegation off at the airport.

    阿尔及利亚军事代表团
    离开罗来我国访问
    新华社开罗26日电　以阿尔及利亚国务部次长奥马尔·乌西迪克为首的阿尔及利亚军事代表团今天上午离开开罗前往北京。这个由九人组成的代表团是应中华人民共和国副总理兼国防部长彭德怀的邀请到中国去访问的。
    代表团在临行前发表书面声明说，代表团访问中国是根据阿尔及利亚共和国和中华人民共和国两国的人民和政府之间的友好政策进行的。当中华人民共和国政府在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立后只几天就承认它的时候，这种友好政策就开始了。声明说，由社会事务部长优素福·本·赫达和军备和供应部长马哈茂德·谢里夫率领的阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团曾经在去年12月访问中国，这加强了伟大的中国人民同斗争着的阿尔及利亚人民之间的友好联系。
    声明说，五年以来，拿着武器的阿尔及利亚人民一直在进行着反对法国压迫者的艰苦战斗。
    阿尔及利亚人民一定要把争取民族独立的斗争进行到底。
    阿尔及利亚社会事务部长本·赫达以及财政经济部长艾哈迈德·弗朗西斯到机场送行。中国驻阿联大使馆参赞林兆南和武官李大中也到机场送行。
