Accelerating the Sorting and Enhancement of the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
Academy of Medical Sciences and Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Collaboration

    This newspaper reports that the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine have begun large-scale collaboration in scientific research to accelerate the sorting and enhancement of traditional Chinese medicine.

    More than thirty researchers from the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine recently went to the Fuchengmenwai Hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, to begin collaborating with Western medicine researchers and determine key research projects. More than ten traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture doctors, led by TCM expert Zhao Xiwu, are working with the cardiology department of Fuchengmenwai Hospital and the physiology department of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to jointly observe the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in treating hypertension and explore its mechanisms. The cardiology department of Fuchengmenwai Hospital is responsible for the diagnosis and clinical observation from the Western medicine perspective, while physicians from the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment from the traditional Chinese medicine perspective. In addition to outpatient treatment on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, several TCM physicians are residing in this hospital to conduct medical work. The Institute of Experimental Medicine's physiology department is responsible for research on the mechanisms of treatment. They plan to conduct research on the pathogenesis of hypertension and the treatment mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in terms of higher nervous activity, autonomic nervous system function, and fluid changes. Research teams led by TCM experts Yue Meizhong and Shen Zhonggui are conducting research on liver diseases, leukemia, bronchial asthma, and gastric ulcers in collaboration with the Department of Internal Medicine of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. TCM gynecology expert Qian Boxuan and his research team are collaborating with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital to conduct research on pelvic organ prolapse and toxemia of pregnancy. The Acupuncture Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine will collaborate with the Department of Surgery of Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the physiology department of the Institute of Experimental Medicine to conduct research on the mechanisms of acupuncture in treating appendicitis. In ophthalmology, Western medicine expert Luo Zongxian and TCM expert Wei Wengui are collaborating to study optic nerve atrophy and other ophthalmic diseases. Research on the above diseases will first focus on observing clinical efficacy, accumulating data, and summarizing experience, and then proceed to mechanism research; mechanism research will begin immediately for diseases with clinically confirmed efficacy.

    Prior to this, various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences had generally begun to study and research traditional Chinese medicine, learning some TCM theories and clinical treatment experience. However, due to the extreme shortage of TCM physicians within the academy, Western medicine doctors had to explore on their own, and generally felt difficulties in their research work. After studying the People's Daily editorial "Seriously Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine," Western medicine experts further realized that to do a good job in the research and sorting of China's medicine, close cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine must be achieved. After consultation between the two academies, the formulation of a collaborative research plan began in early February. TCM and Western medicine experts from both academies believe that collaborative scientific research is an important measure to effectively combine TCM and Western medicine to overcome diseases.

    加速整理和提高祖国医药学遗产
    医学科学院和中医研究院大协作
    本报讯　中国医学科学院和中医研究院开始实行科学研究大协作，加速整理和提高祖国医药学。
    中医研究院的三十多位研究人员最近分别到医学科学院所属阜城门外医院和北京协和医院，开始和西医研究人员合作，确定了重点研究项目。由中医专家赵锡武领导的十多位中医和针灸大夫，与阜城门外医院心脏科和医学科学院实验医学研究所的生理系，共同进行中药和针灸治疗高血压的疗效观察和机制的探讨。由阜城门外医院心脏科负责西医方面的诊断与临床观察，中医研究院医师负责中医方面的诊断和治疗。除每星期一、二、五进行门诊治疗外，有数位中医师住在这个医院进行医疗工作。治疗机制方面的研究，由实验医学研究所生理系负责，他们计划在高级神经活动、植物神经系统机能和液体的变化等方面，进行高血压发病机制及中药、针灸治疗机制的研究。在中医专家岳美中、沈仲圭领导下的研究小组，与协和医院内科进行肝脏疾病、白血病、支气管哮喘、胃溃疡等病的研究。中医妇科专家钱伯煊及其研究小组与协和医院妇产科合作，进行盆器脱垂和妊娠中毒症的研究。中医研究院针灸研究所，将与协和医院外科、实验医学研究所生理系合作，进行针灸治阑尾炎的机制研究。眼科方面，由西医专家罗宗贤和中医专家韦文贵合作，研究视神经痿缩等眼科疾患。对以上疾病的研究，首先是进行临床疗效的观察，积累资料，总结经验，然后进行机制研究；对临床疗效已经肯定的疾病，即开始机制研究。
    在这以前，中国医学科学院各研究所普遍开始学习和研究祖国医学，学到了一些中医理论和临床治疗工作经验。但由于院内中医师极少，只好由西医自己摸索，在研究工作中普遍感到困难。西医专家们学习了人民日报“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的社论后，进一步认识到要作好我国医药学的研究整理工作，必须通过中西医密切合作。经过两院协商，在2月上旬就开始进行制订协作研究计划。两院中西医专家认为，协作进行科学研究工作，是有效地进行中西医结合以战胜疾病的重要措施。　　　（郭少军）
