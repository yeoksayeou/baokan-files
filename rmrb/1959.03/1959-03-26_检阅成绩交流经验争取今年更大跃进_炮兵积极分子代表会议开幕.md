    Review Achievements, Exchange Experiences, and Strive for a Greater Leap Forward This Year
    Artillery Activists' Representative Meeting Opens

The Second Artillery Activists' Representative Meeting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army opened in Beijing today. Six hundred and forty-two artillery activists' representatives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and all parts of the motherland gathered to review the tremendous achievements in political and ideological work, training, and combat against the enemy last year, summarize and exchange advanced experiences, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, and Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, attended the meeting and delivered speeches, congratulating the convening of the conference.

Artillery Commander Chen Xilian delivered a report at the opening ceremony. He said that in 1958, the artillery units achieved tremendous achievements and glorious victories in all aspects, including political ideology, combat, and training. In the battle to punish the Jinmen (Quemoy) Chiang Kai-shek troops, the brave front-line artillery, fearing no hardship, fought heroically, using fierce and accurate artillery fire to powerfully destroy and severely kill the enemy's military equipment, facilities, and combat personnel. They also shot down, damaged, and sunk many U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and ships that harassed the motherland's skies and seas, protecting the safety of the people in the coastal areas. In the battles, a large number of heroic units and people's meritorious personnel emerged. According to incomplete statistics, nine people were awarded first-class merit, forty-five people were awarded second-class merit, and more than one thousand one hundred people were awarded third-class merit. In addition, eight companies, platoons, and squads were awarded collective second-class merit, and twenty-three companies, platoons, and squads were awarded collective third-class merit.

General Chen Xilian said that under the lofty aspiration of mastering skills and defending the motherland, the artillery units' military training achieved outstanding results in 1958. With the deepening of the "one specialty, multiple skills" movement, the artillery's professional training has entered a new stage. By the end of last year's annual training, the artillery units of the entire army had generally reached the level of "all-around gunners" and "dual-skill professional soldiers," and many advanced units had also reached "overall excellence." In addition, ten artillery units and eleven academies proposed more than 80,000 technical innovations in the past year alone.

The activists attending today's conference are representatives of advanced individuals and advanced units on various fronts and in various tasks of the artillery last year. Among them are representatives of a certain company that won the collective second-class merit for sinking and damaging Chiang Kai-shek's ships and amphibious transport vehicles, representatives of the Second Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit that shot down and damaged seven enemy aircraft, heroic soldiers Hu Dean and Chen Jiaming who persisted in fighting despite being burned by flames, as well as experts who have made outstanding contributions in invention and technological innovation and activists who actively participate in the country's socialist construction.
