Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 12th: According to the Cambodian News Agency on the 11th, Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk, when talking about the current situation in Cambodia, said that he still believes that foreign countries are secretly conspiring with Sam Sary, Son Ngoc Thanh, and Choeung Mochulpich, and that foreign countries continue to interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs.

Sihanouk also said when receiving provincial governors, royal representatives, and local officials on the evening of the 9th that the tragic end of Choeung Mochulpich was a major victory for Cambodia, a severe blow to those who supported him with money and weapons, and a disastrous failure for them. His death means that the plans they had painstakingly and meticulously formulated have failed. Sihanouk added that although Choeung Mochulpich is dead, the conspiracy has not ended and continues to be supported by foreign countries, with perhaps the support of "big countries" behind it. He hopes that those who have supported this conspiracy will examine their attitudes and listen to the voice of reason.

    西哈努克首相说
    外国继续干涉柬埔寨内政
    新华社金边12日电　据柬埔寨新闻社11日报道，柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王在谈到柬埔寨目前的局势时说，他仍然认为，外国秘密地同桑·萨里、山玉成和琼·莫舒皮的阴谋共谋，外国继续干涉柬埔寨的内政。
    西哈努克在9日晚上接见各省省长、王室代表和地方长官时还说，琼·莫舒皮的悲惨结局是柬埔寨的重大胜利，是对用金钱和武器支持他的那些人的严厉打击和那些人的惨重失败。他的死意味着他们曾经苦心而周密地制订的计划已经失败。西哈努克又说，虽然琼·莫舒皮已经死了，阴谋并未因此而告终，而且继续受到外国的支持，在背后也许有“大国”的支持。他希望那些支持过这个阴谋的人检查一下自己的态度，并且听听理性的呼声。
