Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 8th: Baghdad Radio broadcast tonight an order issued by Iraqi Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Qassem, requesting officers and soldiers of the Iraqi Fifth Brigade to arrest the brigade's commander, Abdul Wahab Shawwaf, "because he is cooperating with foreigners to undermine the interests of the motherland, and at the same time conspiring to undermine the security of the eternal Iraqi Republic."

Qassem said in another order he issued that "every officer and soldier and civilian" of the Iraqi Republic "has the responsibility to arrest Abdul Wahab Shawwaf and hand him over to the authorities immediately."

An earlier announcement by Baghdad Radio tonight said that "based on the needs of public interest and the recommendation of the Minister of Defense, it is hereby approved to immediately place Colonel Abdul Wahab Shawwaf, Commander of the Fifth Brigade, on the retired list."

Colonel Younis Muhammad Taher has been appointed by the Commander-in-Chief as the new brigade commander.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 8th: Baghdad Radio broadcast yesterday evening an announcement by Qassem, Commander-in-Chief of the Iraqi Armed Forces, to all the people of the Republic, all members of the armed forces, and all tribal people.

The announcement said that the Iraqi Republic will award a cash reward of 10,000 dinars to anyone who catches the traitor of the motherland and retired Colonel Abdul Wahab Shawwaf, who is colluding with imperialism in conspiring against the security of the Iraqi Republic, and hands him over (dead or alive) to the nearest government authority.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 8th: Baghdad Radio broadcast tonight an order issued by Brigadier General Ahmed Salih Abdi, Military Governor of the Iraqi Republic, to all border posts in the Zakho, Tankeshev, and Dogar regions.

The order said that in the event that retired Colonel Abdul Wahab Shawwaf passes through your sentry areas attempting to escape from Iraq, he should be arrested and handed over to the nearest military authority.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 8th: The division commanders of the Iraqi Army all sent urgent telegrams tonight, expressing their support for the Republic and Prime Minister Qassem's order to deal with retired Colonel Abdul Wahab Shawwaf, who is engaged in conspiracy activities, and expressing their support for the policy of taking a firm stance against conspirators.

Commanders of the People's Resistance Forces, the police, security police, People's Resistance Forces, the First Brigade, the Nineteenth Brigade, the Twentieth Brigade, and the Twenty-seventh Brigade, the Rashid Heavy Artillery Battalion, and many garrison commanders have also issued similar telegrams expressing their support for Qassem.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 9th: Iraqi Republic Radio published a commentary on the 8th, saying that the despicable conspiracy of Abdul Wahab Shawwaf, the former commander of the Iraqi Fifth Brigade and retired colonel, and his betrayal of the revolution have aroused strong anger among the armed forces loyal to the revolution and the patriotic forces of the people—all social strata and all nationalities. This anger has strengthened the unity of the Iraqi people and the army and increased their support for their leader, Qassem.

The radio said that under the leadership of Qassem, the Iraqi Republic is realizing the freedom of the people, defending the Republic, and preventing it from being harmed by those who ridicule democracy and freedom. These democratic freedoms are stimulating liberating Arab nationalism, making it stronger and stronger, and enabling it to achieve true harmony and friendship with the Kurdish nation and all domestic minorities.

The radio said that the Iraqi Republic, which has already been victorious in consolidating its existence, will crush all conspirators and traitorous rebels under its feet, whether these people are overt or hidden behind some attractive masks and cloaks.

The radio pointed out that history proves that a republic that relies on the unity of the people, relies on a brave army, and implements a policy of freedom, believes in a democratic system, and opposes personal dictatorship, will stand firm. All conspiracies, aggression plans, and threats will be shattered in its face.

The radio said that the Iraqi people and their armed forces are more united today and stronger than ever before. All conspiracies serving imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries can never harm them in the slightest or divert them from the path they are taking.

    电台说，伊拉克共和国在卡塞姆的领导下，实现着人民的自由，保卫着共和国，不使它遭受侮弄民主自由者的侵害。这些民主自由在刺激着解放的阿拉伯民族主义，使它愈来愈强，使它同库尔德民族和一切国内的少数民族达到真正的和睦和友爱。
