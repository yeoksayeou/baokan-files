    "I am a server in the Tianqiao Market"
    Last summer, many canteens and snack shops in the Tianqiao Market posted signs saying "Find a fly, and the meal is free." Fortunately, there haven't been any flies here for several years. Leaving that aside, let's talk about Auntie Di, a server in the Second Canteen. She is clean and diligent, and always arrives at the canteen an hour early every day to scrub tables, wash benches, tidy utensils, and sweep the floor, constantly busy. When customers sit down, Auntie Di always rushes to them immediately, rattling off more than a dozen dishes for them to choose from. When she sees customers finishing their meal and leaving, she always says with concern, "Make sure you have all your belongings."
    One day, when the canteen was closed for a break, Auntie Di seized the opportunity to sweep the floor and wipe the tables and chairs. Suddenly, she noticed an old piece of clothing piled on a chair in the corner. She muttered, "Whose clothes did they forget to take!" As she picked it up, she felt that the clothing was very heavy, probably with something in the pocket! She took it out and, wow! It was all money, all five-yuan bills, a total of four bundles, each bundle containing five hundred yuan. Auntie Di panicked. She had never seen so much money in her fifty-plus years! There was no one around at this moment, so she rushed to the cashier's office with the old clothing, constantly muttering, "Will something bad happen if this money is lost! Will the person who lost the money do something drastic if they can't find it!" The accountant reminded her, "Don't panic, let's report it to the police station first, and someone will come looking for it soon."
    Sure enough, the person who lost the money came back. He was Li Boyin, a cadre from the People's Committee of Lixian County, Hebei Province, who was carrying public funds to Beijing to purchase livestock... When he got his lost money back, he really didn't know how to express his gratitude. He repeatedly asked for Auntie Di's name and address. Auntie Di finally only told him, "I am a server in the Tianqiao Market." (Attached picture)
    "Look carefully!"
    "Little brother, keep an eye on me!"

    “我是天桥市场上一个服务员”
    去年夏天，天桥市场里，许多食堂和小食店里都贴着“发现一个苍蝇，吃饭不要钱”的标语。好在这里没有苍蝇已是好几年的事了。这且不说，只说第二食堂服务员邸大妈，她干净勤快，每天总是提前一小时到食堂来，刷桌子洗板凳，整理用具与扫地，忙个不休。顾客落座，邸大妈老是立刻赶到面前，一连说出十几样饭菜的名儿来，供顾客选择。看到顾客吃完要走时，又总是关心的说：“您把东西带好了。”
    这天食堂到了休息的时候，邸大妈抓紧空隙扫地擦桌椅，忽然发现墙角的一张椅子上堆放着一件破旧的衣裳，她一边叨念着：“这是谁的衣服忘了带走！”一边拾起来，感到这件衣服很重，可能兜里有什么东西吧！掏出来一看，呵！都是钞票，都是五元一张的钞票，一共四捆，每捆五百元。邸大妈心慌起来。她活了五十多岁从来也没见过这么多的钱呀！这时周围一个人也没有，她慌忙提着这件破衣服往柜房跑，嘴里不断地叨念着：“这些钱丢了会不会出事呀！丢钱的人要老找不着会不会寻死呀！”会计提醒她：“先别着慌，咱们先报告给派出所，一会儿会有人来找的。”
    果然，丢钱的人跑回来了，他是河北省蠡县人民委员会的干部李伯印，他携带着公款到北京来采买牲口的……当他拿回他丢掉的钱时，他真不知怎样感激才好，一再问邸大妈的姓名住址，邸大妈最后只告诉他：“我是天桥市场上的一个服务员”。（附图片）
    “瞧仔细点！”
    “小弟弟，瞧住我！”
