Fully tapping the internal labor potential of industrial and mining enterprises, transportation industries, and basic construction units is an important measure to ensure the overall leap forward in the national economy this year.

Using as little labor as possible to produce as many products as possible is one of the important principles of socialist enterprise management. At all times, we must pay attention to fully leveraging the role of internal labor within enterprises and improving labor productivity. This year, tapping the internal labor potential of enterprises is of particular significance. According to the national economic plan targets for 1959 proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the scale of development of China's industrial production, basic construction, and transportation will be even more magnificent than in 1958. To achieve this magnificent plan, we need not only the necessary material and technical conditions as a foundation, but also a certain amount of labor as a guarantee. Where will the new labor force needed on the industrial front come from? In the past, the main method was to draw labor from the countryside. Can we still draw large numbers of laborers from the countryside this year? No, we cannot. The reason is that a lot of labor was already drawn last year, and this year agricultural production must continue to leap forward, and we must also develop diversified operations, which requires a lot of labor. Before mechanized production is implemented, drawing too much rural labor will hinder the continued great development of agriculture. Since the labor force needed by industry cannot be transferred from the countryside, the way out lies in fully tapping the labor potential of the industrial front itself and making adjustments among enterprises, departments, and regions. This year, fully tapping the internal labor potential of enterprises is not only related to the issue of whether labor productivity can be improved, but especially to the major matter of whether the entire industrial leap forward plan can be realized. Every enterprise must do a good job in this area, not only to achieve increased production without increasing personnel, but also to strive to increase production while reducing personnel, transferring some labor to support newly built enterprises and those that truly need to increase labor. Moreover, after meeting the needs of industry itself, we must, according to needs and possibilities, do our best to transfer a batch of labor to support agricultural production. This is a glorious task for existing enterprises.

The amount of labor used by an enterprise is closely related to equipment, tools, workers' technical level, labor organization, and labor quotas. The more advanced the equipment and tools, the higher the technical level of the workers, the more advanced the labor quotas, and the more rational the labor organization, the less labor is used; conversely, the more labor is used. However, equipment, tools, workers' technical level, etc., can be improved under the conditions that the broad masses of employees give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. As long as we constantly muster our energy, strive for the upstream, and are not satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and learn from advanced enterprises, advanced workshops, advanced groups, and advanced workers at all times, we can improve our equipment and tools, make our technical level higher day by day, make our labor quotas more advanced day by day, and make our labor organization more rational day by day, thereby greatly saving labor.

According to materials from various places, the labor potential within many enterprises is still very large this year. This is because many small and medium-sized enterprises across the country were built during the great leap forward last year. At that time, there were no strict staffing standards and a lack of management experience, and there were still many unreasonable aspects of labor organization and labor quotas; the vast majority of employees were newly recruited, and their production technology was not very skilled; a considerable number of enterprises started with indigenous methods and relied heavily on manual operations, occupying too much labor; these were difficult to completely avoid in the early stages of development. However, after a period of production practice, the management level of these enterprises and the technical level of the workers have improved significantly, the equipment and tools are gradually being improved, and manual operations are gradually being reduced. It is entirely possible to free up a considerable amount of labor. Even if some enterprises have not made much improvement in management and technical equipment, they can still save a lot of labor after a period of effort. In addition, in the great leap forward in production, large and medium-sized old enterprises, thanks to the spirit of daring to think, act, and create displayed by the broad masses of employees, have reformed many equipment and tools and further improved their technical level, and labor productivity has increased significantly, which can also save labor. All this shows that the labor potential within enterprises this year is indeed very large, and there are extremely favorable conditions for tapping the internal labor potential of enterprises. As long as we make good use of these conditions, further develop the mass technological innovation movement, further improve the technical level of workers, especially new workers, and further rectify labor organization and labor quotas, we can completely achieve the goal of increasing production without increasing personnel and increasing production while reducing personnel; we can completely draw a large number of laborers from existing enterprises to support newly built enterprises and those that truly need to increase labor, and we can also draw a group of people to support agricultural production.

If anyone doesn't believe it, please look at the example of Huainan City in Anhui Province. Huainan City plans to increase its total industrial output value by 1.13 times in 1958 this year. According to the preliminary labor plans proposed by various enterprises, the city needs to add more than 150,000 new workers. Later, under the leadership of the Huainan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city's enterprises launched a mass movement to rectify labor organization and reform technology. As a result, not only did they not need to add more than 150,000 new workers, but they could also draw more than 61,000 people from the existing personnel. Of these, in addition to retaining 15,000 people to supplement the city's newly built and expanded enterprises, the remaining 45,000 people could be transferred to support other regions. Currently, more than 25,000 people have returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

Tapping the labor potential of enterprises is a work that involves a wide range of aspects. It not only affects the work of every employee, but also which equipment and tools need to be reformed, which labor organizations and labor quotas are unreasonable, where there are too many people, and where there are too few people. Only the broad masses of employees know best, and only by relying on all employees to take action can it be done well and quickly. Therefore, when carrying out this work, the Party committee must strengthen leadership, put politics in command, repeatedly conduct ideological education for all employees, boldly mobilize employees to speak out freely, hold great debates, and post big-character posters, combine tapping labor potential with technological revolution and improving business management, launch a vigorous mass movement, and set off a new upsurge in production.

Fully tapping the internal labor potential of enterprises is to support national construction and meet the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. Therefore, when there is a surplus of labor, enterprise leaders must promote the communist style and resolutely act in accordance with the principle of "the whole country as one chess game," and transfer personnel whose technical level, cultural level, and physical health meet the needs of the receiving unit. Employees must also promote the communist style, not only having the courage to innovate technology and fight against all unreasonable labor use phenomena, but also having the spirit of resolutely obeying the needs of the country, and going wherever they are needed happily.

Enterprises that truly need to supplement labor must also promote the communist style. They should neither ask for too many people who are needed in production, nor should they arbitrarily raise conditions, and they must act in accordance with the system and not recruit workers privately.

A new upsurge in industrial production and construction in 1959 is taking shape, and the broad masses of employees have already begun to plunge into the torrent of the mass movement of technological revolution. Let us seize the opportunity and fully tap the huge labor potential hidden within enterprises!

### 充分挖掘企业内部劳动力潜力

    充分挖掘企业内部劳动力潜力
    充分挖掘工矿企业、交通运输业和基本建设单位内部劳动力潜力，是保证今年国民经济全面大跃进的一个重要措施。
    用尽量少的劳动力生产尽量多的产品，是社会主义企业经营管理的重要原则之一。不论什么时候，我们都必须注意充分发挥企业内部劳动力的作用，提高劳动生产率。在今年，挖掘企业内部劳动力潜力更具有特殊的意义。根据党的八届六中全会提出的1959年国民经济计划指标，我国工业生产、基本建设和交通运输事业的发展规模，比1958年更加宏伟。要实现这个宏伟的计划，不仅需要有必要的物质技术条件作基础，还要有一定的劳动力作保证。工业战线上需要的新劳动力从哪里来呢？按照过去的作法，主要是从农村抽调。今年能不能再从农村大批抽调劳动力呢？不能了。原因是去年已经抽调了很多，今年农业生产还要继续大跃进，还要发展多种经营，所用的劳动力很多，在没有实行机械化生产以前，过多地抽调农村劳动力，就会妨碍农业继续大发展。工业上所需要的劳动力既然不能从农村调，出路就在于充分挖掘工业战线本身的劳动力潜力，在企业之间、部门之间、地区之间进行调剂。今年充分挖掘企业内部劳动力潜力，不仅关系到能不能提高劳动生产率的问题，尤其是关系到能不能实现整个工业大跃进计划的大事情。每一个企业必须做好这项工作，不但要做到增产不增人，还要尽量做到增产减人，抽调一部分劳动力来支援新建的和真正需要增加劳动力的企业，而且，在满足工业本身的需要之后，还要根据需要和可能，尽力抽调一批劳动力支援农业生产。这是现有企业的一项光荣的任务。
    一个企业使用的劳动力多少，跟设备、工具、工人的技术水平、劳动组织、劳动定额等，都有着密切的关系。设备和工具越先进，工人的技术水平越高，劳动定额越先进，劳动组织越合理，使用的劳动力就越少；反之，就越多。而设备、工具、工人技术水平等等，在职工群众充分发挥积极性和创造性的条件下，都是可以改进的。只要不断鼓足干劲，力争上游，不满足于已经取得的成就，时时刻刻向先进的企业、先进的车间、先进的小组、先进的工人学习，就可以改进自己的设备和工具，使技术水平一天比一天高，劳动定额一天比一天先进，劳动组织一天比一天合理，从而大大节省劳动力。
    根据各地的材料，今年许多企业内部的劳动力的潜力还很大。因为全国有不少中小型企业是在去年大跃进中建设起来的，当时还没有严格的定员标准，又缺乏管理经验，劳动组织和劳动定额还有许多不合理的地方；绝大部分职工又是新招来的，生产技术还不很熟练；相当数量的企业又是用土法上马，手工操作比较多，占用了过多的劳动力；这些都是发展初期难于完全避免的。然而经过了一段时间的生产实践，这些企业的管理水平和工人的技术水平都有了显著的提高，设备和工具也在逐步改善，手工操作在逐步减少，完全有可能腾出相当数量的劳动力来，即使有些企业现在在经营管理和技术设备方面的改进还不大，经过一个时期的努力，仍然可以节省很多劳动力。此外，大中型的老企业，在生产大跃进中，由于职工群众发扬了敢想敢干敢创造的风格，改革了许多设备和工具，进一步提高了技术水平，劳动生产率有显著提高，也是可以节省劳动力的。这些都说明今年企业内部的劳动力潜力确实是很大的，挖掘企业内部劳动力潜力具备着极为有利的条件，只要我们很好地利用这些条件，进一步开展群众性的技术改革运动，进一步提高工人特别是新工人的技术水平，进一步整顿劳动组织和劳动定额，就完全可以达到增产不增人和增产减人的目的；就完全可以从现有企业中抽调出大批劳动力来支援新建设的和真正需要增加劳动力的企业，并且还可以抽出一部分人来支援农业生产了。
    谁不相信，请看安徽省淮南市的例子。淮南市今年计划工业总产值比1958年增加一点一三倍，根据各企业初步提出的劳动力计划，全市需要增加十五万多新工人，后来在中共淮南市委的领导下，全市企业开展了一个整顿劳动组织和改革技术的群众运动以后，不但不需要增加十五万多新工人，而且还可以从现有人员中抽出六万一千多人来。其中除留一万五千人补充本市新建和扩建的企业外，其余的四万五千多人都可以调出支援其他地区。目前已经有二万五千多人回到农村参加农业生产了。
    挖掘企业劳动力潜力是一个涉及面很广的工作，它不仅影响到每一个职工的工作，而且哪些设备和工具需要改革，哪些劳动组织和劳动定额不合理，哪里人多，哪里人少，只有职工群众才最清楚，也只有依靠全体职工行动起来，才能做得好，做得快。因此，进行这一项工作的时候，党委必须加强领导，政治挂帅，对全体职工反复进行思想教育，放手发动职工大鸣大放、大辩论、贴大字报，把挖掘劳动力潜力和技术革命、改善经营管理结合起来，开展一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，掀起一个新的生产高潮。
    充分挖掘企业内部劳动力潜力，为的是支援国家建设，满足工农业大跃进的需要。因此，当劳动力有多余的时候，企业领导人员必须发扬共产主义风格，坚决按照“全国一盘棋”的原则办事，把技术水平、文化水平、身体健康等条件都合乎调入单位需要的人员调出来。职工群众也要发扬共产主义风格，不但要有勇于革新技术、勇于和一切不合理使用劳动力的现象作斗争的精神，还要有坚决服从国家需要的精神，哪里需要，就愉快地到哪里去。
    真正需要补充劳动力的企业，也要发扬共产主义风格，对于生产上需要的人，既不应多要，也不应随便提高条件，而且必须按照制度办事，不能私自招收工人。
    1959年工业生产和建设的新高潮正在形成，广大的职工已经开始投入了技术革命的群众运动的洪流。让我们抓住时机，把蕴藏在企业内部的巨大劳动力潜力充分挖掘出来吧！
