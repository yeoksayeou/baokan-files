Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 24th. Shanghai recently held a drama festival lasting a month. Thirty-seven drama units, ten opera genres, and more than fifty plays participated in the festival. Among them, newly created modern dramas accounted for half.

Many of the excellent plays in this performance were written through the cooperation of professional and amateur artists, after repeated research, discussion, and numerous revisions.

The main purpose of this festival was to promote artistic exchange, and to use a combination of experts and the masses to freely discuss some common and important issues in the drama world, in order to promote the prosperity and flourishing of dramatic art. Many of the plays in the festival will continue to be processed and refined in order to participate in the second phase of the festival to be held in May.

The Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe and the Hualian Yangzhou Opera Troupe, among four units, used the theme of the May 30th Movement to write "Spark," "Torrent of the Huangpu River," and "Shi Hongmei" from different angles. The authors and actors sang with full political enthusiasm about this great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party. These three plays successfully shaped the images of proletarian revolutionaries such as Yang Guiying, Liu Ying, Old Sun, Zhiying, and Shi Hongmei. The Yong Opera "East Wind Blows Spring," reflecting the happy life of the people's commune, is full of the atmosphere of life, with distinct and prominent characters, and vivid and lively language. The achievements of many drama workers in last year's activities of performing, working, and creating have been reflected on the stage.

The popular spoken drama "Three Mothers," and the Shanghai operas "Clear Sky, Myriad Clouds Floating," and "Competing for the Thirteen Tombs," which were created based on real people and events, all broke free from the circle of real people and events and became touching works of art. "Three Mothers," written by the old artist Wu Saiwen, absorbed the traditional creative methods of Chinese opera and the forms popular among the people. The plot is tortuous and the contradictions are sharp and complex, arousing great attention among the audience. The small Shanghai opera "Competing for the Thirteen Tombs," inspired by a small news item in the newspaper and artistically processed, is fresh and lively.

The historical dramas Peking Opera "Hai Rui," "Battle of Feishui," Yue Opera "Wise Trial of the Mud God," Kun Opera "Love Affair at the Wall," and Huai Opera "Female Trial," which were compiled or newly created in this festival, have all achieved gratifying results. Kun Opera "Love Affair at the Wall," through a pair of men and women who fell in love at first sight on the wall, strongly attacked the feudal marriage system and praised Li Qianjun, a more bold and fierce woman than Cui Yingying and Zhu Yingtai.

The four plays performed by Shanghai's unique comic opera genre not only changed the past shortcomings of randomly producing "gags" in performances, but also broke through the circle of portraying trivial matters in the lives of petty citizens. The comic operas "Village of the Sleepless Night" and "Managing Everything," which depict new people and new things in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, reflect serious themes while retaining the humor of comedy.

### 百花争艳  上海举行戏剧会演

    百花争艳
    上海举行戏剧会演
    新华社上海24日电　上海市最近举行了历时一月的戏剧会演。参加会演的有三十七个戏剧单位、十个剧种、五十多个剧目。其中新创作的现代戏占了半数。
    这次演出的优秀剧目，不少都是专业与业余文艺工作者合作，经过反复研究、讨论和多少次修改才写出来的。
    这次会演主要是进行艺术交流，用专家和群众相结合的方法，对戏剧界一些带有普遍意义而又重要的问题进行自由讨论，以促进戏剧艺术的繁荣、兴盛。会演的许多剧目都将继续进行加工、整理，以便参加将在5月间举行的第二阶段的会演。
    上海人民沪剧团和华联扬剧团等四个单位用五卅运动的题材，从不同角度写出了“星星之火”、“黄浦江的激流”、“史红梅”等戏。作者和演员们以饱满的政治热情歌颂了中国共产党领导的这次反帝反封建的伟大斗争。这三个戏相当成功地塑造了杨桂英、刘英、老孙、志英、史红梅等无产阶级革命者的形象。反映人民公社幸福生活的甬剧“东风吹春”，生活气息很浓，人物形象鲜明突出，语言生动活泼。许多戏剧工作者在去年边演出边劳动边创作等活动中获得的成就，已经在舞台上体现出来了。
    根据真人真事创作的通俗话剧“三个母亲”，沪剧“晴空万里彩云飘”、“争上十三陵”，都跳出真人真事的圈子，成为感人的艺术作品。老艺人伍赛文编写的“三个母亲”，吸取了我国戏曲的传统创作方法和民间喜闻乐见的形式，情节曲折，矛盾尖锐复杂，在观众中引起极大的注意。从报纸上一则小消息受到启发，经过艺术加工而成的小型沪剧“争上十三陵”，清新活泼。
    这次会演中整编或新创作的京剧“海瑞”、“淝水之战”，越剧
  “智审泥神”，昆剧“墙头马上”，淮剧“女审”等历史剧，都取得了可喜的成绩。昆剧“墙头马上”，通过一对在墙头马上一见钟情的男女，强烈地攻击了封建婚姻制度，颂扬了一个比崔莺莺、祝英台更加大胆、泼辣的烈性女子李倩君。
    上海特有的滑稽剧种这次演出的四个戏，不仅在演出方面改变了过去那种乱出“噱头”的缺点，而且突破了以往表现小市民生活琐事的圈子。描写工农业生产大跃进中新人新事的滑稽戏“不夜的村庄”、“样样管”，反映的是严肃的主题，同时又保留了喜剧的风趣。
