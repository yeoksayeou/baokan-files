New Songs from the Frontier
    Sha Yin

During February, I traveled for half a month outside Yanmen Pass, visiting the famous ancient frontier city of Datong, and also traversing the mountains and plains of the frontier. With unusually excited feelings, I recorded the songs of the frontier people praising their unprecedentedly wonderful lives. From Yanmen Pass to the outer Great Wall, from the Lüliang Mountains to Pingxing Pass, on the forty-mile Golden Sand Beach, and along the long banks of the Sanggan River, everywhere echoed the vigorous songs of the frontier people – filled with the pride of victors, brimming with invincible confidence.

On this land of "nine droughts in ten years," 4.97 million mu of clear water land has been developed. The overall management projects of the five major river basins of Sanggan River, Hun River, Yang River, Tang River, and Huliu River have been more than half completed. Thus, the frontier climate, like a fiery wild horse, has been tamed by the most outstanding horsemen – the frontier people. Thus, the frontier people began to sing new songs:

　　Barren hills and bald ridges wear new clothes,
　　Salt-alkali flats become granaries,
　　Mountains and reservoirs are scattered like stars,
　　Daring to compare scenery with the two Lakes.

　　Thousands of miles of sandy beaches become orchards,
　　Resting in the shade of trees, watering the fields;
　　Tractors run in the distance,
　　Yellow earth mountains are nowhere to be seen.

　　A cool breeze passes, fish swim in the water,
　　Paddy fields all over the river are like lotus ponds;
　　Travelers, stop praising Suzhou and Hangzhou,
　　Now Yanbei surpasses the south of the Yangtze River.

The lives of the frontier people have also improved accordingly. Those bitter, poignant, and heavy songs have been replaced by completely new songs full of pride.

This year, spring came early to Yanggao Beach. When I visited, it was already "people and horses everywhere, preparing for spring plowing everywhere." People were singing:

　　Yanggao Beach is a land of rice and grain,
　　Harvests get better year after year,
　　Eating enough and eating well,
　　Everyone smiles,
　　Without singing, the mouth is tasteless,
　　Singing makes the mouth full of sweetness.

On the Golden Sand Beach, where "upon reaching Huanghualiang, tears well up in your eyes, a field of good crops swept away by water and sand," joyful songs are resounding:

　　Upon reaching Huanghualiang,
　　Good scenery with grains everywhere,
　　Eyebrows are open and smiling, flowers are fragrant.

In the mountainous areas of Lüliang Mountain, Heng Mountain, and near the outer Great Wall, how many people used to live a life of "getting up empty-handed, moving houses with shoes on"! They sang:

　　Nine out of ten mountains are headless, floods flow everywhere,
　　Walking on the barren mountain ridge, the wind blows tears dry,
　　Looking back at the hometown, rotten kilns and ragged clothes.

The desolate frontier mountainous areas have completely changed, especially in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, when people obtained fruitful rewards from the mountains, with grain yields averaging four to five hundred jin per mu. People love this area, and new songs rise one after another:

　　A field of red sorghum, millet everywhere yellow,
　　Many bean pods, long millet ears,
　　Red-egg-like fruits with smiling faces,
　　Green vegetables emit fragrance,
　　Both irrigated and dry land have good harvests,
　　Slopes and depressions are good for grain.

　　Whips crack everywhere,
　　Herds of cattle and sheep roam the mountains.

After ten years of hard work under the leadership of the Party, poverty has been eliminated. Now, the frontier people, with even grander ideals, have responded to the Party's call for a greater leap forward in 1959:

　　Good scenery inside and outside the Great Wall,
　　Manure accumulation and plowing preparation are in full swing,
　　Men and women, old and young, all go into battle,
　　Each one is stronger than the other.

　　Strive for a yield of a thousand jin per mu,
　　Red flags fly high in the mountainous and plain areas,
　　Four million people are of one mind,
　　Joyfully watching Yanbei cross the Yangtze River!

    塞上新歌
    莎荫
    2月间，在雁门关外旅行了半个月，访问了著名的塞上古城——大同，也跋涉了塞上的山地和平川，我以异常激动的心情记录下塞上人民对于他们亘古未有的美好生活的歌颂。从雁门关到外长城，从吕梁山到平型关，在四十里金沙滩上，在桑干河漫长的两岸，到处响着塞上人民昂扬的歌声——充满胜利者的骄傲，洋溢着无往不胜的信心。
    在这片“十年九旱”的土地上，发展了四百九十七万亩清水地。桑干河、浑河、洋河、唐河、壶流河五大流域的全面治理工程完成了一大半。于是，像一匹烈性野马似的塞上气候，被最出色的驭手——塞上人驯服了。于是，塞上人便唱起了新歌：
    荒山秃岭穿新装，
    盐碱滩成米粮仓，
    山川水库星罗布，
    敢和两湖比风光。
    千里沙滩变果园，
    树下歇凉水浇田；
    远处跑着拖拉机，
    四面不见黄土山。
    清风过时鱼游水，
    满川稻田一塘莲；
    游人休夸苏杭好，
    如今雁北赛江南。
    塞上人民的生活也相应地提高了。那些苦难、辛酸的沉重歌声也就被完全新的、充满自豪的歌声所代替了。
    今年阳高滩上春来早，我去访问的时候，已经是“人马遍地是，处处备耕忙”了，人们唱着：
    阳高滩是米粮川，
    收成一年赛一年，
    吃饱又吃好，
    人人笑开颜，
    不唱歌儿口无味，
    唱起歌来满口甜。
    在“上了黄花梁，两眼泪汪汪，一片好庄稼，水冲沙压一扫光”的金沙滩上，正响彻着欢乐的歌声：
    上了黄花梁，
    五谷遍地好风光，
    眉开眼又笑，花开喷鼻香。
    在吕梁山、恒山和靠近外长城的山区，过去有多少人过着“人起炕光，穿鞋搬家”的生活！他们唱着：
    十山九无头，洪水遍地流，
    走上荒山梁，风吹泪不干，
    回头看家乡，烂窑破衣裳。
    荒凉的塞上山区，已经完全变了，特别是大跃进的1958年，人们从山地上取得丰硕的报酬，粮食产量平均每亩达到四、五百斤。人们热爱着这个地区，新歌声此起彼伏：
    高粱一片红，黍子遍地黄，
    豆子荚儿多，谷子穗儿长，
    红蛋蛋的果子面带笑，
    绿油油的蔬菜放清香，
    水地旱地都丰收，
    坡坡洼洼好打粮。
    鞭声到处响，
    牛群羊群遍山岗。
    在党的领导下苦干了十年，摆脱了贫困。如今，塞上人怀着更雄伟的理想，响应了党1959年更大跃进的号召：
    长城内外好风光，
    积肥备耕一片忙，
    男女老少齐上阵，
    一个更比一个强。
    力争亩产千斤粮，
    山区平川红旗扬，
    四百万人一股劲，
    喜看雁北过长江！
