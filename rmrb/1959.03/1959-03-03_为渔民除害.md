On February 2nd, a gale of force seven or eight, which had lasted for three or four days, had just subsided. Tens of thousands of fishermen from Pingtan Island in Fujian Province and nearby counties such as Changle, Fuqing, Putian, and Hui'an, sailed thousands of fishing boats to the Niushan Ocean fishing grounds to chase the southward migrating schools of fish.

At noon, as the fishermen were reeling in the nets they had cast in the morning, and were rejoicing over the large catch of fresh fish, a Chiang Kai-shek (KMT) gunboat, carrying Kuomintang armed agents, sneaked into the fishing grounds, attempting to rob them. A fierce battle immediately unfolded on the sea.

The KMT gunboat charged towards two motorized sailing fishing boats. More than a dozen militiamen fishing on these two motorized sailing boats spotted the enemy vessel. The commander, Fang Baolin, immediately ordered everyone to reel in their nets and prepare for battle. "Shooting fortifications" were quickly built on the bows of the boats using fishing nets. The militiamen, armed with gleaming machine guns, submachine guns, and rifles, took up their combat positions. In order to prevent other fishermen from suffering losses during the battle, they decided to lure the enemy gunboat out of the fishing grounds before engaging it. The two boats then sailed towards Pingtan Island at top speed in combat formation.

The Kuomintang armed agents on the gunboat desperately chased after them, bullets whistling over the fishing boats. The enemy vessel was only four or five hundred meters away from them. Seeing that the enemy vessel had been lured out of the fishing grounds and into the effective firing range of the boats' various weapons, Fang Baolin shouted at the top of his lungs:

"Fire! Fire decisively!" As soon as he finished speaking, a dense barrage of gunfire from various weapons on the two boats suddenly poured onto the enemy vessel. Young militiaman Lin Qin'ken, a former reconnaissance soldier in the front-line Xiamen forces before his discharge, had honed excellent marksmanship. He continuously used his machine gun to shoot down four or five armed agents standing on the deck. Twenty-four-year-old Zheng Shiyi Di was wounded in the hand while shooting. He handed his gun to someone else to continue firing, enduring the pain as he prepared bullets for his comrades. Some militiamen simply took off their coats, determined to go all out.

The battle lasted for thirty or forty minutes. The armed agents on the vessel, seeing that there was no hope of seizing the two motorized sailing boats, and fearing being bombarded by the People's Liberation Army's coastal artillery if they got too close to Pingtan Island, fired a volley of guns and cannons at the motorized sailing boats, then turned around and fled back to the fishing grounds, attempting to rob other fishing boats.

Just at that moment, a People's Navy gunboat unit arrived after hearing the news. When the enemy vessel realized this, they hurriedly fled towards Matsu Island.

Standing on the gunboat's command platform, our army commander Ruan Guoquan saw the Chiang Kai-shek gunboat fleeing through his binoculars. He ordered the flotilla to pursue at full speed. The fishermen, seeing their own gunboats arriving, quickly cleared the sea for them to advance. The armed agents on the Chiang Kai-shek gunboat, seeing that they could not escape, opened fire to obstruct them, and shells exploded continuously in the sea. Ruan Guoquan disregarded everything and commanded the flotilla to seize a favorable firing position. With a command, a large number of shells fired simultaneously from each vessel exploded on and around the enemy vessel. The rear of the enemy vessel immediately billowed with thick smoke and flames, and it was crippled on the sea. As our flotilla rapidly fired on the enemy vessel again, half of the enemy vessel had sunk into the water. As our vessels rapidly approached the enemy vessel, an armed agent attempting to resist stubbornly suddenly climbed up from the deck of the enemy vessel, grabbing a machine gun and about to fire. The sharp-eyed and quick-handed gunner of our army, Sun Yaoren, preemptively fired a burst of shells, sending that fellow and his machine gun into the sea.

As Ruan Guoquan and the soldiers prepared to board the Chiang Kai-shek gunboat, which was riddled with holes and burning, the Chiang Kai-shek gunboat, with the large white characters "63" painted on its hull, suddenly capsized like a somersault, sinking completely to the bottom of the sea. More than a dozen armed agents, terrified by the militiamen and naval soldiers, floated and sank on the sea, struggling on the brink of death.

Our navy sailors threw them lifebuoys and lifelines, pulling them one by one onto the gunboats. According to the prisoners, there were a total of twenty-three Kuomintang armed agents on the sunken gunboat. Apart from the twelve who were captured, the other eleven were all killed or drowned.

As the People's Navy flotilla returned victoriously, the fishermen in the fishing grounds, near and far, stood happily on the bows of their boats, waving, applauding, and cheering. When two Chiang Kai-shek gunboats, covered by eight Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, arrived attempting to retaliate, our People's Air Force fighter aircraft also arrived. The Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and gunboats, like rats seeing a cat, slipped away without daring to show their faces.

### 为渔民除害

    为渔民除害
    新华社记者　冶峰
    2月2日，一连刮了三、四天的七、八级大风刚刚平息。福建省平潭岛和附近的长乐、福清、蒲田、惠安等县的万名渔民，驾着几千条渔船，云集牛山洋渔场，追捕南游的鱼群。
  中午，当渔民们收起早晨撒下的渔网，正为捕到很多鲜鱼而高兴时，一艘载着国民党武装特务的蒋军炮艇，偷偷摸摸地钻进渔场，企图进行抢劫。海上立即展开了一场恶战。
    蒋军炮艇向两条机帆渔船冲来。在这两条机帆船上捕鱼的十几个民兵发现敌艇后，指挥员方保林立即命令大家收起渔网，准备战斗。船头上很快用渔网筑起了“射击掩体”，手持擦得发亮的机关枪、冲锋枪和步枪等武器的民兵各自站上了战斗岗位。为了使其他渔民在战斗时免受损失，他们决定把敌人的炮艇吸引到渔场外面再打。两条船便按战斗队形以最快的速度向平潭岛方向驶去。
    炮艇上的国民党武装特务拼命地向他们追赶，子弹嗖嗖地从渔船上空飞过。敌艇离他们只有四、五百公尺了，方保林一看敌艇被诱出了渔场，并进入了船上各种火器的有效射程，便放开喉咙大喊一声：
  “打！坚决打！”话音刚落，两条船上的各种火器突然向敌艇上射出密集的枪弹。青年民兵林琴肯，退伍前曾在厦门前线部队当过侦察兵，练了一手好枪法，他连续用机枪打倒了站在艇面上的四、五个武装特务。二十四岁的郑十一俤，射击时手上负伤了，他把枪交给别人继续射击，自己忍着痛为伙伴们准备子弹。有的民兵索性把外衣都脱掉了，决心利利落落地大干一场。
    战斗持续了三、四十分钟。艇上的武装特务眼看想抓走两条机帆船是没有希望了，又怕再靠近平潭岛受到解放军海岸大炮的轰击。他们对机帆船乱射了一阵枪炮，就调过头奔回渔场，企图抢劫别的渔船。
    正在这时候，人民海军的一支炮艇部队闻讯赶来了。敌艇发觉后，慌忙向马祖岛方向逃跑。
    站在炮艇指挥台上的我军指挥员阮国权，从望远镜中看到蒋军炮艇正在逃跑，他命令艇队以全速向前追击。渔民们看见自己的炮艇赶来了，迅速给它们让开了前进的海面。蒋军炮艇上的武装特务看到逃不掉了，便开炮阻拦，炮弹连续在海里爆炸。阮国权不顾一切地指挥艇队抢占了有利的射击方位，一声命令，各艇齐发的大批炮弹同时在敌艇上和它的周围爆炸了，敌艇后部随即升起浓烟烈火，被打瘫在海面上。当我军艇队再次向敌艇急速射击时，敌艇已有半截沉下水里去了。我军各艇迅速向敌艇靠拢，一个企图顽抗的武装特务忽地从敌艇艇面上爬起来，抓住机枪刚要射击，眼明手快的我军瞄准手孙耀仁抢先打出了一串炮弹，把那个家伙连机枪一起打到海里去了。
    阮国权和战士们准备登上被打得千孔百疮正在燃烧的蒋军炮艇时，这艘艇舷上写着“六十三”号白色大字的蒋军炮艇，突然像驴打滚似地上下一翻，全部沉下海底了。被民兵和海军战士们打得丧魂失胆的十几个武装特务，在海面上漂上沉下，正在死亡线上挣扎着。
    我军水兵们向他们抛去救生圈和救生绳，把他们一个一个地捞上了炮艇。据俘虏供称：被击沉的这艘炮艇上，共有二十三个国民党武装特务，除了被俘的十二人外，其余的十一个全被打死或淹死了。
    当人民海军的艇队胜利返航时，渔场上远远近近的渔民们欢乐地站在船头上向他们招手、鼓掌和欢呼。当两艘蒋军炮舰在八架蒋军飞机掩护下，赶来企图报复时，我人民空军歼击机群也已飞临。蒋军飞机和炮舰像老鼠见到猫似的，没敢照面便溜掉了。
