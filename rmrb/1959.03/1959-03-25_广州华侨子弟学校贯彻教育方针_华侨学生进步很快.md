Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 24th: Many schools for overseas Chinese children in Guangzhou have implemented the policy of "combining education with productive labor." As a result, the ideological awareness of students has significantly improved, the atmosphere of learning and labor is strong, and cultural and sports activities are very active, showing a new outlook.

Since last year, students in various overseas Chinese children's schools in Guangzhou, together with students in general schools, have actively participated in work-study programs, and have initially developed a habit of loving labor. Many overseas Chinese schools have established fixed connections with local factories and farms, or have set up small factories and farms themselves, organizing students to spend a certain amount of time each week or month participating in factory or farm labor. Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Middle School Remedial School, in conjunction with teaching practice last semester, built factories for steelmaking, coking, sulfuric acid, refractory bricks, and mechanical repair on campus. Students spent a certain amount of time each week participating in labor production in these factories or nearby farms. Students of Lehui County Overseas Chinese Middle School, in order to support farmers in striving for a greater harvest of early rice, recently made great efforts to accumulate fertilizer during after-school hours, with high school students in grades one and two averaging nearly a hundred loads of fertilizer per person.

Through work-study programs, the academic performance of overseas Chinese students in various schools has improved significantly compared to the past. Jinan University, where overseas Chinese students account for 65% of the student body, participated in production practice in rural areas, fishing villages, and ships last semester in conjunction with teaching, learning and practicing at the same time, and completed more than 200 scientific research projects. When the overseas Chinese students who graduated from Guangzhou No. 5 Middle School last year participated in the entrance examination, their scores were better than those of previous sessions. All eight high school graduates were admitted to university; and more than 92% of the 96 junior high school graduates who participated in the entrance examination were admitted.

After work-study programs, many activists have emerged among the overseas Chinese students in various schools. Last semester, 72 overseas Chinese students at Guangdong Overseas Chinese Middle School were named learning and labor models, and more than 500 were named activists. Among the eighty-six overseas Chinese students at South China Normal University, 50% have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

    广州华侨子弟学校贯彻教育方针
    华侨学生进步很快
    新华社广州24日电　广州市许多华侨子弟学校，贯彻执行“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针后，学生的思想觉悟显著提高，学习和劳动空气都很浓厚，文娱活动和体育活动也很活跃，出现了一片新气象。
    去年以来，广州市各华侨子弟学校的学生和一般学校的学生一道，积极参加勤工俭学，已经初步养成了热爱劳动的习惯。许多华侨学校都和当地工厂、农场建立固定的联系，或自己办了小型工厂、农场，组织学生们每周或每月抽出一定的时间参加工厂或农场劳动。广州归国华侨中等补习学校，上学期结合教学实习，在校内建起了炼钢、炼焦、硫酸、耐火砖、机械修配等工厂，学生每周以一定时间到这些工厂或附近农场参加劳动生产。乐会县华侨中学学生为了支援农民争取早稻更大丰收，最近利用午后课余时间大搞积肥运动，高中一、二班的学生平均每人积了近百担肥。
    各校华侨学生通过勤工俭学，学业成绩比过去有了显著的提高。华侨学生人数占65％的暨南大学，上学期结合教学到农村、渔村、轮船去参加生产实践，边劳动边实习，完成了二百多项科学研究项目。广州市第五中学上届毕业的华侨学生参加升学考试时，成绩比过去历届都好，八名高中毕业生全部考进了大学；九十六名初中毕业生，参加升学考试的人92％以上都被录取。
    各校华侨学生经过勤工俭学以后，还出现了许多积极分子。广东华侨中学上学期有七十二名华侨学生被评为学习和劳动模范，有五百多人被评为积极分子。华南师范学院的八十六个华侨学生中，有50％的人参加了共产党和共青团。
