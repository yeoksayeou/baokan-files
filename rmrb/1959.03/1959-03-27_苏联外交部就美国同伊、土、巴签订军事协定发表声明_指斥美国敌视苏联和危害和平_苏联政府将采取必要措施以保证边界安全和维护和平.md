Xinhua News Agency, March 26th dispatch from Moscow, TASS: The Soviet government issued a statement on the 25th regarding the United States' conclusion of bilateral military agreements with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. The statement said, "The Soviet government cannot but regard such actions by the governments of the United States, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan as actions hostile to the Soviet Union and the cause of peace." The statement also said, "It goes without saying that the Soviet government will take the necessary measures to ensure the security of the Soviet borders and maintain peace."

The statement pointed out that, according to foreign newspapers, the U.S.-Iran and U.S.-Pakistan military agreements include secret clauses specifying the specific obligations of both parties and the ways to implement the agreements. Such news has not been substantially refuted.

The statement said that the above three identical agreements refer to the Baghdad Pact and the infamous "Eisenhower Doctrine." Under the pretext of "defending" against a non-existent threat of aggression, the signing of these agreements means tying Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan more tightly to the American chariot, means opening the territories of these countries to American troops and using American troops there, and means turning these countries into American military springboards. The American ruling group, as the most powerful party to these agreements, reserves for itself the possibility of interfering in the internal affairs of these three countries and deciding, according to its own opinion, on the use of American troops on the territory of these countries.

The statement said that the bilateral agreements stipulate that the U.S. government will jointly implement military strategic measures with the governments of Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. This means that the United States can prepare to use the territories of the aforementioned countries as battlefields according to the plans of American warlords.

This is a matter of revising and re-drafting the strategic plans of the Baghdad Pact and drafting new plans, taking into account the changes caused by the crisis of the group, and stipulating the reallocation of forces, so that Britain will further retreat to a secondary position within the Baghdad Pact, and the main role of leading the participating countries will be transferred to the United States.

The statement said that the American warlords do not conceal that they are assigning Turkey a major role in their plans of aggression against the Soviet Union and its Arab neighbors, preparing to turn Turkey into a major rocket-atomic base adjacent to the southern border of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, which sincerely cares about establishing friendly and good-neighborly relations with Turkey, cannot but consider the policy of the current Turkish government to be very, very dangerous.

Speaking of the U.S. military agreement with Iran, the statement said that the United States hopes that the military agreement signed with Iran can create conditions for completely pulling Iran into the U.S. military measures in the Middle East. If the Baghdad Pact is regarded by the American ruling group as a "link" in the chain of aggressive military blocs - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization - then Iran, in the eyes of the Americans, is such a part of this chain: without this part, their military plans and plans to strangle the newly liberated Eastern countries and impose new colonial enslavement on them would be bankrupt.

The statement pointed out that a series of facts prove that someone is making Iran participate more and more actively in the U.S. military measures in the Middle East. Preparations are now being made to use Iranian territory to establish U.S. military bases. This policy deepens Iran's current subordinate status within the scope of the Badag Pact, and it will gradually turn Iran into a semi-colony of the United States.

The statement emphasized that the military agreement signed between Iran and the United States makes it possible for Iranian territory to become a military-strategic springboard for imperialist countries against the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation. The military agreement signed between the Iranian government and the United States is an intolerable violation of the obligations undertaken by Iran under the currently valid Soviet-Iranian Treaties of 1921 and 1927.

Speaking of the new military agreement signed between Pakistan and the United States, the statement said that the facts prove that the new military agreement makes the Pakistani army and Pakistan itself as a country increasingly subordinate to the aggressive plans of the United States. In addition to the large number of American military advisers and American special military missions stationed in Pakistan, there are also more than a thousand engineering troops specializing in building military bases and rocket launching sites. This policy of the Pakistani government has aroused justifiable concern from Pakistan's peace-loving neighbors. Pakistan's continuous acquisition of American weapons and expanded military cooperation with the United States has encouraged certain groups in Pakistan to make various preparations against India and Afghanistan. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Afghan Prime Minister Daoud reminded the world public in their statements of the above-mentioned situation arising from the conclusion of a military agreement between Pakistan and the United States.

The statement said that it can be seen from the above that the United States' conclusion of bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan has aggravated international tensions and created a danger to peace in the Near and Middle East and Southeast Asia. It goes without saying that this practice of the U.S. government cannot be associated with its repeated declarations that it has the intention of peace and peaceful resolution of international problems. The United States' signing of these agreements with the direct participation of Britain is an act hostile to the Soviet Union. The People's Republic of China, India, Afghanistan, the Republic of Iraq, and other peace-loving countries rightly consider the above-mentioned agreements to be extremely hostile measures against these countries.

The statement said that the American ruling group here plays the disreputable role of an international gendarme against the people of the Eastern countries who have only recently freed themselves from colonial oppression. The American ruling group is now betting on all kinds of alliances whose purpose is to interfere in the internal affairs of the Eastern countries and suppress those forces that the colonialists do not like. However, the statement went on to emphasize that the people of Asia and Africa will never compromise with attempts to re-enslave them. No military alliance pieced together by colonial countries can stop the irresistible and vigorous development of the liberation struggle of the Eastern nations.

The statement concluded by saying that bilateral military agreements will not bring any benefits to Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, and will not help to ensure their security. Their practice of expanding military cooperation with the United States and undertaking new military obligations, in the era of cosmic rockets and artificial earth satellites, will not increase their military potential in the slightest, but will only make their territories become battlefields for the interests of American and British monopoly groups in the event of war. The statement also said that Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan's signing of military agreements with the United States makes them even more subordinate to the policies of aggressive blocs of Western powers. Undoubtedly, these military agreements have aggravated the situation in the vast areas along the southern border of the Soviet Union or in areas directly adjacent to these areas.

### 苏联外交部就美国同伊、土、巴签订军事协定发表声明  指斥美国敌视苏联和危害和平  苏联政府将采取必要措施以保证边界安全和维护和平

    苏联外交部就美国同伊、土、巴签订军事协定发表声明
    指斥美国敌视苏联和危害和平
    苏联政府将采取必要措施以保证边界安全和维护和平
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府25日就美国同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦缔结双边军事协定发表了声明。声明说：“苏联政府不能不认为美国、伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦政府的这种行动是敌视苏联、敌视和平事业的行动。”声明又说：“不言而喻，苏联政府方面将采取必要的措施，以保证苏联边界的安全和维护和平。”
    声明指出，据外国报纸透露，美国——伊朗军事协定和美国——巴基斯坦军事协定中包括有秘密条款，这些条款规定双方的具体义务和实现协定的途径。这种消息实质上没有受到反驳。
    声明说，上述三个内容相同的协定参照了巴格达条约和恶名昭著的“艾森豪威尔主义”。在
  “防御”莫须有的侵略威胁的借口下，签订这些协定意味着把伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦更紧地捆在美国的战车上，意味着把美国军队开入这些国家的领土并在那里使用美国军队，以及把这些国家变成美国的军事跳板。作为这些协定的最强有力的一方的美国统治集团，使自己保留有干涉这三国内部事务并根据自己意见决定关于使用在这些国家领土上的美国军队的问题的可能性。
    声明说，双边协定规定美国政府将同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦政府共同实行军事战略措施。这就是说，美国可以根据美国军阀的计划来准备把上述国家的领土当作战场。
    这就是修改和重新拟定巴格达集团的战略计划并拟定新的计划的问题，这些计划考虑到由于这个集团的危机而发生的变化，并且规定重新配置力量，使英国在巴格达集团内进一步退居二等地位，而领导这个集团的参加国的主要角色将转由美国扮演。
    声明说，美国军阀并不掩饰，他们把自己反对苏联和阿拉伯邻国的侵略计划中的一个主要角色分配给土耳其，准备把土耳其变成挨近苏联南部边境的一个主要的火箭原子基地。真诚关心同土耳其建立友好睦邻关系的苏联，不能不认为土耳其现政府的政策是非常非常危险的。
    声明在谈到美国同伊朗的军事协定时说，美国指望同伊朗签订的军事协定可以为把伊朗完全拉过来参加美国在中东的军事措施创造条件。如果巴格达集团被美国统治集团看作是在侵略性的军事集团——北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织——中的链条中的一个“环节”，那么，伊朗在美国人的眼中就是这根链条中的这样一个部分：没有这一部分，他们的军事计划以及扼杀不久前获得解放的东方国家并对它们实行新的殖民奴役的计划就会破产。
    声明指出，一系列的事实证明，有人在使伊朗越来越积极地参加美国在中东的军事措施。现在正在准备利用伊朗领土来建立美国军事基地。这种政策加深了伊朗现今在巴达格集团范围内的从属地位，它将使伊朗逐渐变成美国的半殖民地。
    声明强调说，伊朗同美国签订的军事协定使伊朗领土有可能变成帝国主义国家反对苏联的军事战略跳板，苏联对这种情况不能漠然视之。伊朗政府同美国签订的军事协定令人不能容忍地违背了伊朗根据现今有效的1921年和1927年签订的苏伊条约所承担的义务。
    声明在谈到巴基斯坦同美国签订新的军事协定时说，事实证明，新的军事协定使巴基斯坦的军队和作为一个国家的巴基斯坦本身越来越从属于美国的侵略计划。巴基斯坦国内除了驻有大量的美国军事顾问和美国特别军事使团外，还驻有千人以上的工程兵部队专门建造军事基地和火箭发射场。巴基斯坦政府这种政策引起巴基斯坦爱好和平的邻邦理所当然的担心。巴基斯坦不断获得美国武器并同美国扩大军事合作，这种情况鼓舞了巴基斯坦某些集团去作反对印度和阿富汗的种种准备。印度总理尼赫鲁和阿富汗首相达乌德在自己的声明中提醒世界公众注意鉴于巴美缔结军事协定而产生的上述情况。
    声明说，从上述情况中可以看出，美国同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦签订双边军事协定一事，加剧了国际紧张局势，并给中近东和东南亚的和平造成危险。不言而喻，美国政府的这种做法无论如何是同它一再声明的所谓它具有对和平及和平解决国际问题的意图联不到一起的。美国在英国的直接参与下签订这些协定，这是敌视苏联的行动。中华人民共和国、印度、阿富汗、伊拉克共和国和其他爱好和平国家公正地认为，上述协定是极端敌视这些国家的措施。
    声明说，美国统治集团在这里扮演着反对不久前才摆脱殖民压迫的东方各国人民的国际宪兵这个不体面的角色。美国统治集团现在把赌注放在形形色色的联盟上，这些联盟的宗旨是干涉东方国家内政和镇压殖民主义者所不喜欢的那些力量。但是，声明接着强调指出，亚非国家人民决不会和妄想重新奴役他们的企图妥协。殖民主义国家拼凑起来的任何军事联盟，都不能阻止东方各民族不可抑制地蓬勃发展的解放斗争。
    声明最后说，双边军事协定不会给伊朗、巴基斯坦和土耳其带来任何好处，决不会有助于保证它们的安全。它们扩大同美国的军事合作并承担新的军事义务的做法，在宇宙火箭和人造地球卫星的时代，丝毫也不能增加它们的军事潜力，而只会使它们的领土在一旦发生战争时成为替美英大垄断集团的利益而战的战场。声明又说，伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦同美国签订军事协定，这更加使它们听命于西方大国侵略集团的政策。无疑地，这些军事协定加剧了沿苏联南部边境的广大地区或者与这些地区直接接近的地区局势。
