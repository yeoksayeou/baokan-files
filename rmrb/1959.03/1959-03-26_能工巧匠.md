Behind the Scenes

    Skilled Craftsmen

    Why did the Zhang Yujin group complete more than nine months' worth of work in sixty-four workdays? Why did the Zhang Huaji group do nine months of work in two and a half months?

    The answer: "Studying produces skilled craftsmen, and many skills increase efficiency."

    What is most thought-provoking here is the relationship between "study" and "skill."

    Everyone wants to be a skilled craftsman. But where do "ability" and "skill" come from? Obviously, they don't fall from the sky. They require people to work hard and study diligently. Whoever puts in the effort can become skillful and capable; whoever puts in the most effort can become the most skillful and capable. Isn't the Zhang Yujin group and the Zhang Huaji group following this path?

    As the saying goes, nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, anyone can be a skilled craftsman. The question is whether they have the determination to study hard and the perseverance to be unyielding.

    能工巧匠
    为什么张玉金小组六十四个工作日完成了九个多月的工作量？为什么张化吉小组两个半月干了九个月的活？
    答曰：“钻研出巧匠，艺多效率高。”
    这里最耐人寻味的是“钻”和“巧”之间的关系。
    谁都愿意做个能工巧匠。但是，“能”和“巧”从哪儿来，显然不是从天上掉下来的，需要人们辛勤劳动，刻苦钻研。谁付出了劳动，谁就能变巧变能；谁付出了最大的劳动，谁就能变成最巧最能。张玉金小组、张化吉小组不正是从这条道路走过来的吗？
    俗语说得好，天下无难事，只怕有心人。在大跃进的时代里，谁都可以做能工巧匠，问题在于有没有刻苦钻研的决心，有没有坚韧不拔的毅力。
