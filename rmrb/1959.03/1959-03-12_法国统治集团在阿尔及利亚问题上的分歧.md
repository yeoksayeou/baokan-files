The divisions within the French ruling class over the Algerian question have become more apparent since early February. When Debré went to Algeria, extreme right-wing reactionaries held demonstrations and shouted slogans such as "De Gaulle is a murderer" and "Send De Gaulle to the gallows." When De Gaulle himself traveled to southwestern France, similar, albeit smaller, demonstrations also occurred.

This internal discord is an expression of the despair felt by the French ruling group as the Algerian National Liberation Army has won repeated victories recently, and as they sense their colonial rule is nearing its end.

De Gaulle is a trump card thrown out by the French monopoly groups to save the deep political crisis of the French colonial empire. The monopoly groups elevated this figure in the hope of using his appeal to some within the French army, especially exploiting the illusions the French people have about him, to establish a regime that promotes dictatorship under the banner of the republic, and to forcibly implement policies that benefit the monopoly groups. In the Algerian question, they want to use De Gaulle's influence from his participation in the anti-German struggle in North Africa during World War II to carry out the goals of splitting and disintegrating the Algerian people's national liberation movement, thereby maintaining their colonial position in North Africa. The plantation owner group that instigated the military coup in Algeria hoped that De Gaulle, after coming to power with their support, would listen to their plan to annex Algeria under their influence and pressure. On the common ground of maintaining colonial rule, the two forces reached an agreement to support De Gaulle's coming to power. However, the two forces had inconsistent demands on De Gaulle's approach to the Algerian question. The De Gaulle regime, which emerged as a result of compromise, has always been vague on the Algerian question, neither openly claiming to implement "annexation" nor playing with words about closely "welding" Algeria and France together, but never putting forward a clear proposition. This, in addition to having a side of deceiving the people, also reflects the internal contradictions of the French ruling group. De Gaulle has had to try to maintain what he often calls the so-called "balance of power" with this ambiguous attitude.

After all, times have changed. The French monopoly groups know that with the French people's calls for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian question growing louder and the Algerian people's struggle for independence becoming increasingly strong, the hope of naked military suppression and annexation is not only slim, but also risks completely losing the little political capital that De Gaulle relies on to maintain his rule. How to cleverly safeguard their colonial interests and get rid of the Algerian war, which has become a heavy burden on French economic expansion, has become the goal that the monopoly groups are painstakingly seeking. For the benefit of their group, they are prepared to sacrifice the interests of the plantation owners.

Judging from De Gaulle's words and deeds since he came to power, the French monopoly groups intend to implement the following set of policies:

De Gaulle's policy towards Algeria differs from that of previous governments in that it focuses on the Constantine Plan as its core and key. Generally speaking, De Gaulle hopes to achieve three goals through this plan: (1) To use some so-called welfare undertakings and the claim that "developing North Africa" can "enable the Algerian people to have more employment" and that their lives can be "improved" as bait to split the unity of the Algerian people and paralyze the people's fighting spirit. (2) To promote the relationship between "developing North Africa" and the "future" of France, thereby politically blinding the people, covering up the truth of their colonial plunder in Algeria, inciting chauvinistic sentiments, and weakening the French people's opposition; and economically forcing the people to contribute more manpower and financial resources to support their suppression and exploitation of Algeria. (3) To absorb the capital of international monopoly groups to participate in the plunder of North African resources, so as to facilitate the use of the pressure of international monopoly capital to stifle the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

Of course, this is not the entirety of De Gaulle's policy towards Algeria; as an auxiliary part of the above plan, there is also military "appeasement" and political division.

De Gaulle will never give up military means until he achieves his goal of dividing and inducing the surrender of the Algerian National Liberation Army. However, in the face of the heroic fighting of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the situation of the French colonial army has become increasingly worse. It is reported that the French army has twenty-two divisions, of which seventeen are stationed in Algeria, and 90% of these seventeen divisions are used to defend strongholds and communication lines, with only a small amount of mobile forces. Therefore, the French colonial army authorities are constantly requesting reinforcements. However, France is currently facing the difficulty of insufficient active-duty troops (because the troops conscripted from this year onwards are people born during World War II, and the number of young and strong men of the right age is small). Therefore, the colonial army authorities are also considering withdrawing some troops from certain areas in order to strengthen the mobile assault forces in a way that can cut flesh to heal sores. This is enough to show the predicament France is encountering. In this situation, the French authorities have to try to find a "shortcut" other than the main means of military suppression.

In coordination with the above two methods, De Gaulle also intends to pick up the "election" weapon that had once gone bankrupt in the general election, that is, to re-search for a group of local figures with a "free" color in the recent local elections as objects to discuss the "future status" of Algeria with the government. It is estimated that if the ultimate goal can be achieved, the French monopoly groups intend to give Algeria, as a member of the "community," "partial local autonomy" as the price for getting rid of the war and maintaining colonial rule.

This set of practices by the French monopoly groups through De Gaulle has aroused the opposition of the French plantation owner group in Algeria. In order to maintain their exploitation, these people frantically shouted "annexation" and demanded the maintenance of absolute rule over the Algerian people. They feared that even "partial autonomy" would harm their bloody and barbaric exploitation. They clamored for increasing troops in Algeria and opposed the plan to withdraw troops. They tried to ensure that the people elected in the local elections were those who wholeheartedly defended their interests. The fear of losing their own interests drove them to issue slogans attacking De Gaulle. They exerted pressure on De Gaulle and his backstage bosses and implemented a "war of nerves."

Because these people have a traditional influence in North Africa and are combined with the local feudal forces, De Gaulle remained silent each time he extended his probing tentacles to promote the above plan and encountered their counterattacks. There are signs that while De Gaulle is trying his best to strengthen his control over the North African army, he is trying to compromise with the plantation owners in two aspects. In the economic aspect, the plan of "developing North Africa" includes increasing the establishment of small-scale light industries, attempting to obtain the cooperation of the plantation owners through this way, absorbing the investment of the plantation owners, and distributing them a certain amount of profit. In the political aspect, it is guaranteed that there will be a certain number of plantation owner representatives in the local elections. But people doubt how effective these buffers are and how long their effectiveness can be maintained.

More importantly, the Algerian people's unyielding struggle has and will continue to exacerbate the difficulties of the French ruling group. The more difficulties increase, the deeper the sense of the end, and the more serious their internal divisions will be. In this constant and increasingly fierce quarrel, the French people and even the middle forces will be educated.

Faced with the pressure of the plantation owners, and at the same time, French military activities have not suffered a fatal blow, and the French economy has not yet reached the end of its rope, De Gaulle will continue to fight. But this can only further lead to a dead end. De Gaulle expects and promises his "victory," but what awaits him is only the opposite of victory—the complete failure of colonialist policies. The victorious will be the Algerian people who are fighting for their national independence.

    法国统治集团在阿尔及利亚问题上的分歧
    杨效农
    2月初，法国统治阶级内部对阿尔及利亚问题的分歧，趋于表面化。当德勃雷赴阿尔及利亚时，极右反动分子曾举行示威，并喊出“戴高乐凶手”、“把戴高乐送到死刑台去”的口号。当戴高乐本人到法国西南部出行时，也曾发生了类似的只是规模较小的示威。
    这种内部的龃龉，是在阿尔及利亚民族解放军近来不断获胜后，法国统治集团感到自己的殖民统治日益临近末日所表现出来的一种绝望情绪。
    戴高乐是法国垄断集团为了挽救法殖民帝国深重的政治危机而抛出的一张王牌。垄断集团所以抬出这个人物来是希冀利用他在法国军队中的一些号召力量，特别是利用法国人民对他存有的幻想，来建立一个挂共和招牌、推销独裁的政权，强制地推行有利于垄断集团的政策。其中在阿尔及利亚问题上，即想利用戴高乐在二次世界大战中曾在北非进行过抗德斗争这个影响，遂行分化与瓦解阿尔及利亚人民民族解放运动，借此保持在北非殖民地位的目的。当时策动阿尔及利亚军事政变的庄园主集团，则希望戴高乐在他们支持上台后，能在他们的影响与压力下，听从他们吞并阿尔及利亚的计划。在维护殖民统治这一共同点上，两种力量就支持戴高乐上台取得了协议。但两种力量对戴高乐关于阿尔及利亚问题上的做法的要求则不一致。作为妥协结果而出现的戴高乐政权所以在阿尔及利亚问题上一直含混其辞，既不公开声称实行“吞并”，又玩弄字眼说要把阿尔及利亚与法国紧密地“焊接”在一起，但却一直不拿出明确主张来。这，除了有欺骗人民的一面外，也正反映了法国统治集团的内部矛盾。戴高乐不得不企图以这种模棱的态度，来维持他常说的所谓“力量的平衡”。
    毕竟时代变了，法国垄断集团知道：在法国人民要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的呼声日高，阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争日益强大的今天，如果赤裸裸地用军事镇压实行吞并的办法，不但希望渺茫，而且有使戴高乐借以维持统治的一点政治资本完全输光的可能。采取什么办法既巧妙地维护自己的殖民利益而又从使法国经济扩张形成重负的阿尔及利亚战争中摆脱出来，就成为垄断集团苦心寻求的目标。为了自己集团的利益，他们是准备牺牲庄园主的利益的。
    从戴高乐上台后的言行看来，法国垄断集团是打算实施下列一套政策的：
    戴高乐的对阿尔及利亚政策，和过去历届政府不同的地方，在于它是以君士坦丁计划作为核心和重点。大体说来，戴高乐希望通过这个计划达到三方面的目的：（一）以办一些所谓福利事业和宣称“开发北非”后可以“使阿尔及利亚人民更多就业”，生活可以得到“提高”作为诱饵，分化阿尔及利亚人民的团结，麻痹人民的斗志。（二）宣传“开发北非”和法国“前途”的关系，从而在政治上蒙蔽人民，掩盖其在阿尔及利亚进行殖民掠夺的真相，煽动沙文主义情绪，减弱法国人民的反对；在经济上迫使人民拿出更多的人力财力支持其对阿尔及利亚的镇压和剥削。（三）吸收国际垄断集团的资本参加对北非资源的掠夺，从而便于借助国际垄断资本的压力，扼杀阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。
    当然，这并不是戴高乐对阿尔及利亚政策的全部；作为上述计划的辅助部分的，还有军事“绥靖”与政治分化。
    戴高乐在未达成其分化诱降阿尔及利亚民族解放军的目的之前，绝不会放弃军事手段。但在阿尔及利亚民族解放军英勇战斗面前，法国殖民军处境已愈来愈恶劣。据悉，法陆军有二十二师，其中十七个师放在阿尔及利亚境内，而这十七个师中的90％又用于防守据点和交通线，机动兵力只有很少。因之，法国殖民军当局不断要求补充兵源。可是法国目前又遇到了现役兵源不足的困难（因从今年起征调的兵源，正是第二次世界大战期中出生的人，适龄壮丁人数少）。因之，殖民军当局还考虑从若干地区收缩一部分兵力，以便能挖肉补疮地加强机动突击兵力。这已足以说明法国所遭遇的困境。在这种情况下，法国当局不得不企图在军事镇压的主要手段以外，另寻“捷径”。
    与上述两种手法相配合，戴高乐还打算再收拾起在大选中已一度破产的“选举”武器，即在最近的地方选举中再物色一批带“自由”色彩的地方人物，作为与政府商谈阿尔及利亚“未来地位”的对象。人们估计，如果最终目的能达到，法国垄断集团是打算以给阿尔及利亚“共同体”中一员实行“部分地方自治”，作为摆脱战争，维持殖民统治的代价。
    法国垄断集团通过戴高乐所搞的这一套，激起了阿尔及利亚境内法国庄园主集团的反对。这批人为了保持自己的剥削，疯狂地喊叫“吞并”，要求维持对阿尔及利亚人民的绝对统治。他们害怕即使“部分自治”也会危害他们血腥的野蛮剥削。他们叫嚷增兵阿尔及利亚，反对收缩兵力的计划。他们力图使地方选举中选出的人是死心踏地维护其利益的人。害怕自己利益丧失的心理，驱使他们发出了攻击戴高乐的口号。他们向戴高乐及其后台老板施加压力，实行“神经战”。
    由于这批人在北非有传统影响，而且和当地封建势力结合着，因之戴高乐每次伸出其推行上述计划的试探触角而遇到他们的反击时，就表示沉默。有迹象显示，戴高乐在极力设法加强其对北非军队控制掌握的同时，正设法在两个方面与庄园主实行妥协。在经济方面，在“开发北非”的计划中增加开办小型轻工业，企图通过这一途径取得庄园主的合作，吸收庄园主的投资，分给他们以一定利润。在政治方面，保证地方选举中有一定名额的庄园主代表。但这些缓冲剂有效程度如何？效力能保持多久，人们是表示怀疑的。
    更重要的是阿尔及利亚人民的不屈不挠的斗争，这个斗争已经并且将继续加剧法国统治集团的困难。困难愈增，末日之感愈深，其内部分歧也将愈加严重。在这场不断的且将愈来愈剧烈的争吵中，法国人民甚至中间力量将受到教育。
    面对庄园主的压力，同时法国军事活动尚未受致命打击，法国经济也还未到山穷水尽之际，戴高乐还会继续打下去。但这只能进一步陷入死胡同。戴高乐期望着也在约许着他的“胜利”，但等待他的只是胜利的反面——殖民主义政策的彻底失败。胜利的将是为自己民族独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。
