Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 21st — Hu Dean, a heroic gunner of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, has basically recovered from his injuries. On the 20th, he and representatives of the frontline artillery units set off for Beijing to attend the All-Army Artillery Activists Representative Conference.

Hu Dean was wounded in a shelling battle to punish the Kinmen Chiang troops on September 11th last year. At that time, an incendiary bomb landed on the artillery position and ignited a raging fire. In order to protect the artillery piece and the lives of his comrades, he braved the flames and fired a shell about to explode in the gun's chamber, resulting in severe burns covering 66% of his body. After the all-out rescue efforts of a certain PLA hospital on the Fujian Front, and with the support from many quarters, including thousands of local people who voluntarily signed up to donate blood, starting with the First Secretary of the CPC Prefectural Committee, his life was snatched back from the jaws of death.

During the treatment, Hu Dean demonstrated his heroic character in every way. While still lying in bed, he endured the pain to exercise the joint function of his arms and legs every day. From the seventy-third day after entering the hospital, he began to get out of bed and walk, and insisted on studying. In the hospital, he finished reading Volume I and part of Volume II of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and also read books such as "Dedicate Everything to the Party" and "The Legless Flying General."

Over the past few months, Hu Dean has received hundreds of letters from Heilongjiang, Hebei, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. These letters unanimously expressed the desire to learn from the heroic qualities of this communist fighter and to establish meritorious service for the motherland on various fronts.

    英雄炮手胡德安伤愈
    来京参加炮兵积极分子代表大会
    新华社福建前线21日电　福建前线中国人民解放军某部英雄炮手胡德安，伤势已经基本痊愈，20日和前线炮兵部队代表一起，启程去北京参加全军炮兵积极分子代表大会。
    胡德安是在去年9月11日惩罚金门蒋军的一次炮战中负伤的。当时，一发燃烧弹落在炮兵阵地上燃起烈火，他为了保全大炮和战友们的生命，冒着烈火把炮弹膛里即将爆炸的一发炮弹打了出去，因而浑身受到66％的严重烧伤。经过福建前线解放军某医院的全力抢救，并且得到当地自中共地委第一书记以下成千人自动报名输血等多方面支援，才从死神手里夺回了生命。
    在治疗期间，胡德安处处表现了英雄本色。当他还躺在病床上时，就每天忍着疼痛锻炼臂和腿的关节机能。自从进入医院的第七十三天起，开始下病床走路，并且坚持了学习。他在医院中读完了毛泽东选集的第一卷以及第二卷的一部分，还阅读了“把一切献给党”和“无脚飞将军”等书。
    几个月来，胡德安先后收到了来自黑龙江、河北、河南、内蒙古、甘肃、浙江和福建各地的几百封来信，这些信上一致表示要学习这个共产主义战士的英雄品质，在各个战线上为祖国建立功勋。
