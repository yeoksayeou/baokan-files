    Soda niter comes in white, gray, light reddish-brown, and even lemon-yellow colors. It appears as transparent or semi-transparent crystals, typically in massive, granular, powdery, or layered forms, but it turns into powder when exposed to air for a long time. When soda niter is burned on charcoal, it explodes, melts into a solution, and dyes the flame a deep yellow. Soda niter is easily soluble in water. Its composition includes sodium nitrate.
    Soda niter usually occurs in independent mineral layers, but it can also be found alongside rock salt, gypsum, clay sand, etc. Occasionally, it coexists with iodates and other minerals.
    Soda niter has a wide range of uses, primarily as a fertilizer. Because it is an alkaline fertilizer, it is suitable for application in acidic soils. Soda niter can also be used to manufacture nitric acid, saltpeter, potassium nitrate, barium nitrate, picric acid (yellow explosive), sodium nitrite, and iodine can be extracted from soda niter containing iodine.

    钠硝石
    钠硝石有白色、灰色、淡红褐色，也有像柠檬一样的黄色。它的形状是透明或微透明的结晶体，普通的结晶形状为块状、粒状、粉状或间成层状，但曝在空气中久了，就变成粉末。钠硝石放在木炭上燃烧就发生爆炸，熔成溶体，并把火焰染成浓黄色。钠硝石容易为水溶解。成分含有硝酸钠。
    钠硝石一般都是独立矿层，也有与岩盐、石膏、粘土砂粒等相伴生，偶然也有与碘酸盐和其他矿物共生的。
    钠硝石用途很广，主要是用作肥料。因为它是一种碱性肥料，适合施用于酸性土壤。钠硝石还可以制造硝酸、硝石、硝酸钾、硝酸钡、苦味酸（黄色炸药）、亚硝酸钠，含碘的钠硝石，还可以制碘。
