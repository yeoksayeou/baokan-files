    Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem officially notified the governments of Britain, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan on March 24th and solemnly declared to the world that Iraq was withdrawing from the "Baghdad Pact." From then on, Iraq became a free, independent, and fully sovereign nation. It will establish relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries, on the basis of friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. This decision by the Iraqi government is clearly a great encouragement to the Iraqi people and the people of Arab countries in their struggle against imperialism, and another head-on blow to the imperialists and their agents.
    In fact, the "Baghdad Pact" group, this sinister tool of American and British imperialism for invading Arab countries, had long been paralyzed by the victory of the Iraqi revolution. At the beginning of the Republic, the Iraqi government closed the headquarters of the "Baghdad Pact," forcing the imperialists and their lackeys to quietly move the headquarters of this aggressive group to Ankara. The "Baghdad Pact" had long ceased to have Baghdad. However, the imperialists have not given up, and they are still shamelessly stealing and tarnishing the sacred name of Baghdad, vainly attempting to make a comeback and once again trample on the land of free Iraq. After the suppression of the Shawwaf rebellion, the "Wall Street Journal" still "hoped" for a "change" in the Iraqi government to "suit the West's wishes." And now, the Iraqi government, based on the will of the people, has formally announced its withdrawal from the "Baghdad Pact" group! This completely shattered the imperialists' illusions, formally pronounced the death sentence of the "Baghdad Pact," and once again demonstrated the determination of the Iraqi people to oppose imperialism, safeguard national independence, and pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. Therefore, this important decision by the government of the Iraqi Republic will have a positive impact on consolidating Iraq's independence and freedom and enhancing the unity among the people of Arab countries. Not only the Arab people but all countries and peoples who oppose imperialism and love peace around the world sincerely welcome this decision by the Iraqi government.
    From the very first day of its birth, the Iraqi Republic has waged a sharp and intense struggle against imperialist aggression to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty. It is precisely because of this that the Iraqi Republic and its leaders have won the support and love of the Iraqi people and have also won the respect of the people of Arab countries and peace-loving people around the world.
    Since the victory of the July 14th Revolution, the Iraqi government and people have repeatedly foiled the conspiracies of subversion and rebellion concocted by the imperialists and their followers. However, the enemies of Iraq's independence and freedom have not given up, and they are continuing to plot intervention in the Iraqi Republic. One cannot ignore the fact that American imperialism, which has already participated in various major institutions of the "Baghdad Pact," recently signed bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan respectively. The remaining member states of the "Baghdad Pact" recently held a meeting in Ankara; the Iranian army has been ordered to "closely and carefully monitor the development of the situation in Iraq" along the border; the Turkish High Command has also taken so-called "security measures" in the Turkish-Iraqi border area. There are reports that the US President actually ordered the Sixth Fleet to be on "alert," supposedly to deal with the situation in Berlin. But people clearly remember that when the Iraqi Revolution had just triumphed, wasn't the US Sixth Fleet also on "alert" in preparation for armed intervention? At the same time, the imperialists are trying their best to incite hatred and conflict between Arab countries, attempting to create a situation of Arabs fighting Arabs, so as to facilitate their armed intervention in Iraq and Arab countries. This situation cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Iraqi people, the people of Arab countries, and all those who care about maintaining peace and security in this region.
    However, the imperialists' conspiracies and wishful thinking are one thing, and whether these conspiracies and wishful thinking can succeed is another. The Iraqi people have a glorious revolutionary tradition and a long history of experience in dealing with imperialism and domestic and foreign reactionaries. They cannot be defeated, nor can they be intimidated. For forty years, the heroic Iraqi people have fought stubbornly against the tyranny of feudal lords and imperialism, one after another, and have launched five large-scale uprisings in just over twenty years. And the last uprising, the one on July 14th last year, finally overthrew the reactionary dynasty, armed to the teeth by imperialism for betraying the country and the people, and won a great victory in the national democratic revolution. The heroic Iraqi people, having already won independence and freedom, know how to defend the fruits of the revolution; having been able to smash the dictatorial machine of the tyrant Faisal, they will certainly be able to make all imperialists and foreign reactionary forces, who covet and covet the territory of the Republic, suffer a crushing defeat!
    The Iraqi people's just struggle to maintain independence and freedom and defend their new motherland is by no means isolated. They have the sympathy and support of the fraternal Arab people, the people of Asian and African countries, and the powerful peace forces of the world headed by the Soviet Union. Although the imperialists are doing their best to sow discord between Arab countries and between Arab countries and socialist countries, the awakened people of Arab countries have been able to see through the serious harm of this conspiracy of the imperialists to the independence and security of Arab countries from their own historical experience. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the Asian and African countries that actively uphold the spirit of the Bandung Conference, as well as all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and people in the world, have supported, still support, and will always support the struggle of the people of Arab countries against imperialism and for national liberation.

### 高举反帝的旗帜继续前进

    高举反帝的旗帜继续前进
    伊拉克总理卡塞姆于3月24日正式照会英国、伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦政府，并向全世界庄严地宣布：伊拉克退出“巴格达条约”。从此，伊拉克就变成了一个自由、独立和拥有完整主权的国家。它将在友好、平等和互利的基础上和所有国家建立关系，特别是邻近的国家。伊拉克政府的这一决定，显然是对伊拉克人民以及阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义斗争的一个极大鼓舞，也是对帝国主义者和它们的代理人的又一次迎头痛击。
    事实上，美英帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的这一罪恶的工具“巴格达条约”集团，早就随着伊拉克革命的胜利而陷于瘫痪了。伊拉克政府在共和国开国伊始就封闭了“巴格达条约”的总部，而迫使帝国主义者和它们的喽罗们不得不把这个侵略集团的总部悄悄地搬到安卡拉去。“巴格达条约”早就没有了巴格达。可是，帝国主义者并没有死心，它们仍然厚颜无耻地盗用和玷污着巴格达这个神圣的名字，妄想卷土重来，再度蹂躏自由伊拉克的国土。在沙瓦夫叛乱被扑灭以后，“华尔街日报”还在“希望”伊拉克政府的“变革”，以“合西方的心意”。而现在，伊拉克政府根据全国人民的意志，正式宣布了退出“巴格达条约”集团！这就彻底地粉碎了帝国主义者的幻想，正式宣告了“巴格达条约”的死刑，又一次表明了伊拉克人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和奉行和平中立政策的决心。因此，伊拉克共和国政府的这一重要决策，对于巩固伊拉克的独立和自由，增进阿拉伯各国人民之间的团结，都将发生积极的影响。不但阿拉伯人民，全世界一切反对帝国主义、爱好和平的国家和人民，都衷心欢迎伊拉克政府的这一决定。
    伊拉克共和国从它诞生的第一天起，就为维护民族独立和国家主权而同帝国主义侵略势力进行了尖锐的、紧张的斗争。正是因为这样，伊拉克共和国和它的领导人得到了伊拉克人民的拥护和爱戴，同时也赢得了阿拉伯各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的尊敬。
    7月14日革命胜利之后，伊拉克政府和人民曾经多次粉碎了帝国主义及其追随者制造的颠复和叛乱阴谋。然而伊拉克独立与自由的敌人并未死心，他们正在继续策划着干涉伊拉克共和国的阴谋活动。人们不能忽视这样的事实：已经参加了“巴格达条约”各种主要机构的美帝国主义，不久以前同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦分别签订了双边军事协定。“巴格达条约”残余成员国最近在安卡拉举行了会议；伊朗陆军已经奉命在边境一带“密切和认真地注视伊拉克的事态的发展”；土耳其的高级司令部也在土伊边境地区采取了所谓“安全措施”。有消息说，美国总统居然下令第六舰队处于“戒备状态”，据说这是为了应付柏林的局势。但是人们清楚地记得，在伊拉克革命刚刚胜利的时候，美国的第六舰队不也是为了准备武力干涉而处于“戒备状态”的吗？与此同时，帝国主义者竭力在阿拉伯国家间煽动仇视和冲突，力图造成阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的局势，以便于它们对伊拉克和阿拉伯各国进行武装干涉。这种局势当然不能不引起伊拉克人民、阿拉伯各国人民和一切关心维护这一地区和平与安全的人们的严重警惕。
    但是，帝国主义者的阴谋和妄想是一回事，而这种阴谋和妄想能不能得逞又是一回事。伊拉克人民有着光辉的革命传统，有着同帝国主义和国内外反动派打交道的悠久的历史经验。他们打不倒，也吓不退。四十年来，英勇的伊拉克人民前仆后继地向封建主和帝国主义的暴政进行了顽强的斗争，仅仅二十多年间，就发动过五次大规模的起义。而最后一次起义，也就是去年7月14日的起义，终于推翻了由于出卖国家和人民而为帝国主义武装到牙齿的反动皇朝，赢得了民族民主革命的巨大胜利。英勇的伊拉克人民，既然已经获得了独立和自由，他们懂得怎样去保卫革命的果实；既然能够把费萨尔暴君的专政机器打得粉碎，当然也就能够使一切垂涎和觊觎共和国领土的帝国主义者和外国反动势力碰得焦头烂额！
    伊拉克人民维护独立和自由，捍卫自己新生祖国的正义斗争，决不是孤立的。他们有着阿拉伯兄弟人民、亚非各国人民和以苏联为首的全世界强大的和平力量的同情和支持。尽管帝国主义者竭尽挑拨阿拉伯各国之间和阿拉伯国家与社会主义国家之间的团结，但是觉醒了的阿拉伯各国人民从他们切身的历史经验中，已经能够看穿帝国主义者的这种阴谋对于阿拉伯各国的独立与安全的严重危害性。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和积极维护万隆会议精神的亚非国家以及全世界一切爱好和平、主持正义的国家和人民，过去支持了、现在仍然支持、而且今后将永远支持阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义和争取民族解放的斗争。
