　　Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 15th. Beirut's "Al-Haya" newspaper commented on March 14th on the anti-Republic of Iraq movement launched by the UAR authorities, saying, "Making Arabs fight Arabs is the most dangerous conspiracy that imperialism has successfully pulled off."
　　The newspaper pointed out that Arab countries have suffered under imperialist and colonial rule for more than forty years, and they have been struggling for freedom, independence, and national sovereignty, giving imperialism a heavy blow. It said that thanks to the cooperation of the Arab people, the Arab national liberation movement has achieved some success in the struggle against imperialism.
　　The newspaper said, "It is regrettable that the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to make Arabs fight Arabs has succeeded." It pointed out that the aim of U.S. imperialism is to eliminate the republican regime in Iraq and establish a reactionary regime to suppress freedom and stifle the voice of the people.
　　The newspaper warned that the current danger is more serious than in the past. It pointed out that Israel remains a pillar of imperialism, and the Rountree Plan is still in effect. In addition, the resolutions of the Baghdad Pact Karachi Conference, the bilateral military agreements signed by the United States with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, and the measures implemented in the UAR to oppose democracy and freedom, all of these are threats to every Arab country.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 16th. Dispatches from the Middle East by American news agencies indicate that Western imperialist countries are trying to use the current situation in the Middle East to achieve their own sinister aims.

　　United Press International reporter Landrey, in a dispatch from Cairo on March 14th, said, "The United States now finds that Nasser is fighting the same communist enemy in the same region." He said that Nasser's actions "go beyond" domestic affairs, and "in this struggle that is now taking place, the West suddenly finds itself on Nasser's side." The reporter also wrote in Cairo: "The West, long referred to here as the 'imperialist enemy,' has almost become a forgotten target."

　　Landrey also said that U.S. diplomatic officials believe that Nasser's words are "a more powerful weapon than the Eisenhower Doctrine."

　　Landrey explained the West's strategy of ostensibly not directly participating in the UAR and Iraq's dispute: "Because there is a deep-seated anti-Western sentiment throughout the Middle East, diplomatic officials believe that exuberant Western support for Nasser would hinder rather than help him."

　　Another United Press International dispatch from Baghdad on March 14th said, "Western prestige in Iraq today has fallen to a new low... As Nasser's prestige declines, so does the West's prestige."

    贝鲁特“呼声报”评阿联反伊拉克运动
    使阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人是帝国主义阴谋
    西方通讯社透露帝国主义利用中东局势来达到阴险目的
    新华社贝鲁特15日电　贝鲁特“呼声报”14日评论阿联当局发动的反对伊拉克共和国的运动说，“使阿拉伯人打击阿拉伯人是帝国主义搞成功的最危险的阴谋”。
    报纸指出，阿拉伯国家身受帝国主义和殖民主义统治已经有四十多年了，它们一直在为争取自由独立和获得民族主权而斗争，并且给了帝国主义以沉重的打击。它说，由于阿拉伯人民的合作，阿拉伯民族解放运动已经在反对帝国主义的斗争中取得了一定的成功。
    报纸说，“令人遗憾的是：美帝国主义力图使阿拉伯人打击阿拉伯人的阴谋竟成功了。”它指出，美帝国主义的目的就在于消灭伊拉克的共和国政权，建立用来镇压自由和压制人民呼声的反动政权。
    报纸警告说：目前的危险比过去更为严重。它指出，以色列仍然是帝国主义的支柱，朗特里计划还在产生效力。此外，加上巴格达条约卡拉奇会议的决议，美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订的双边军事协定以及在阿联所实行的反对民主自由的措施等，所有这一切都是对每一个阿拉伯国家的威胁。
    新华社16日讯　美国通讯社由中近东发出的电讯表示，西方帝国主义国家正在力图利用目前中近东的局势来达到自己的阴谋目的。
    合众国际社记者兰德雷14日自开罗发出的一条消息说，“美国现在发现，纳赛尔正在同一个地区打击同一个共产党敌人。”他说，纳赛尔的做法“超出了”内政范围，“在这场现在正在进行的斗争中，西方突然发现它站在纳赛尔一边”。这个记者还在开罗写道：“长期以来在这里被称为‘帝国主义敌人’的西方，几乎成为被人遗忘的目标”。
    兰德雷还说，美国的外交官员们认为，纳赛尔的话是“比艾森豪威尔主义更有力的武器”。
    兰德雷解释西方表面上不直接参加阿联和伊拉克的争执的策略说：“由于整个中东存在着根深蒂固的反西方的情绪，外交官员们认为，西方对纳赛尔进行得意忘形的支持对他来说将是妨碍而不是帮助。”
    合众国际社14日自巴格达发出的另一条消息说，“西方今天在伊拉克的威信下降到新的低潮……随着纳赛尔威信的降低，西方的威信也降低了。
