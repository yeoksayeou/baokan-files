Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Manila Dispatch: Amidst the rising anti-American sentiment among the Philippine people, the United States was forced to resume negotiations with the Philippines in early March regarding the revision of the base agreement, which had been interrupted for a time.

According to newspaper reports, these secret Philippine-US negotiations did not reach any agreement. On the contrary, the dispute between the Philippines and the US over the jurisdiction of military bases has become more acute. It is revealed that the US negotiator, US Ambassador to the Philippines, Bohlen, insisted during the negotiations that the Philippine proposal of 1956 regarding the settlement of the jurisdiction issue should be the basis for reaching an agreement. He stated that this was the US's final "concession." This plan mainly stipulates that the United States recognizes the Philippines' jurisdiction over non-duty American soldiers who commit crimes within the base. However, the final decision on whether the offending American soldier was on duty at the time of the crime rests with the commander of the US military base. This plan is obviously unfavorable to the Philippines, as it still allows US soldiers to act as they please. Therefore, it has been criticized by people from all walks of life in the Philippines, and the Philippine authorities have had to reject the US request.

Fifteen senators from different parties in the Philippine Senate submitted a proposal on March 21 regarding the revision of the base agreement. On the 24th, the Senate also strongly stated that any new agreement reached between the Philippine government and the United States on the base issue would not be approved by the Senate if it did not conform to the resolutions made by the Senate.

The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives, Mitra, said on the 22nd that unless the US government recognizes the sovereignty of the Philippines over US military bases within its territory, it would be impossible to reach a satisfactory solution on the issue of these military bases.

According to the "Manila Chronicle," the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Sumulong, also said, "The United States should turn its claims regarding the recognition of Philippine sovereignty over the bases here into concrete and affirmative terms."

It is reported that facing strong opposition from all walks of life in the Philippines, US Ambassador Bohlen is currently adopting coercive and seductive tactics in an attempt to force the Philippine authorities to make concessions that would harm national sovereignty through secret negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Manila Dispatch: The "Manila Chronicle" reported on the 28th that some Philippine congressmen launched a movement on the 27th aimed at eliminating inequalities in various treaties between the Philippines and the United States and strengthening the Philippines' position in these treaties.

A draft resolution drafted by a powerful group in the House of Representatives, led by Acting Speaker of the House of Representatives Castaneda and Representative Roses, clearly demonstrates this.

The proposal, which is expected to be submitted next week, suggests establishing a special committee of the House of Representatives to "study and recommend revisions to existing agreements between the two countries."

The House of Representatives' proposal calls for a re-examination of the US-Philippines Mutual "Defense" Treaty, the Military Assistance Treaty, the Laurel-Langley Trade Agreement, the Quirino-Foster Agreement, and the Romulo-Snyder Agreement.

In a statement outlining the reasons for re-examining these agreements, Castaneda emphasized that the problems between the Philippines and the United States should be dealt with comprehensively. He also said: "Such a major and serious issue cannot be resolved incompletely or piecemeal." Congressmen Veloso, Apaldo, Enviga, Ligot, and Cabanban agreed to the re-examination.

### 美菲恢复修改基地协定谈判  菲公众抨击美国无视菲律宾主权

    美菲恢复修改基地协定谈判
    菲公众抨击美国无视菲律宾主权
    据新华社27日讯　马尼拉消息：在菲律宾人民反美情绪日益高涨的情况下，美国被迫在3月上旬同菲律宾恢复了一度中断的关于修改基地协定的谈判。
    据报纸报道，这一次菲美秘密谈判并没有达成任何协议，相反地，菲美双方在军事基地的裁判权问题上的争执更加尖锐了。据透露，美国谈判代表、美国驻菲律宾大使波伦在谈判中坚持要以菲律宾在1956年提出的有关解决裁判权问题的方案，作为达成协议的基础。他表示这是美国的最后的“让步”。这个方案主要规定，美国承认菲律宾对在基地内犯罪的非值勤的美国军人有审判权，但是对于犯罪的美军当时是否正在值勤的最后决定权则属于美军基地的司令官。这个方案显然对菲律宾不利，它仍然使美国军人可以任所欲为，因此，受到菲律宾各界人士的纷纷抨击，菲律宾当局也不得不表示拒绝美国的要求。
    菲律宾参议院的十五名不同党派的议员曾经在3月21日提出一项关于修改基地协定的提案。参议院在24日还强烈表示，菲律宾政府在基地问题上和美国达成的任何新的协定，如果不符合参议院作出的决议，那么，参议院将不予批准。
    菲律宾众议院外交委员会主席米特拉22日发表谈话说，除非美国政府承认菲律宾对本国境内的美国军事基地的主权，否则不可能在这些军事基地的问题上达成满意的解决。
    据“马尼拉纪事报”报道，参议院外交委员会主席苏木朗也说，
  “美国应该把它关于承认菲律宾对这里基地的主权的主张，变成具体的和肯定的条款。”
    据报道，面对着菲律宾各界人士的强烈反对，美国大使波伦目前正在采取威逼利诱的手段，企图通过秘密谈判迫使菲律宾当局作出有损国家主权的让步。
    据新华社29日讯　马尼拉消息：“马尼拉纪事报”28日报道，菲律宾一些国会议员27日发动了一个旨在消除菲律宾和美国之间各项条约中的不平等现象以及加强菲律宾在这些条约中的地位的运动。
    以众议院临时议长卡斯塔尼达和众议员罗赛斯为首的众议院的一个有势力的集团所起草的一项决议草案清楚地表明了这一点。
    预料将在下星期提出的这项提案建议设立一个众议院特别委员会，以便“研究并建议修改这两国之间现有的协定。”
    众议院的这项提案要求重新审查美菲共同“防御”条约、军事援助条约、劳雷尔—朗格莱贸易协定、季里诺—福斯特协定和罗慕洛—斯奈德协定。
    卡斯塔尼达在一项声明中申述对这些协定重新进行审查的理由时着重指出，菲律宾和美国之间的问题应该加以全盘处理。他还说：“对这样一种重大的和严重的问题不能够不彻底地或者一点点地解决。”赞同重新审查的议员有众议员维络索、阿波尔多、恩维加、利戈特和卡班班。
