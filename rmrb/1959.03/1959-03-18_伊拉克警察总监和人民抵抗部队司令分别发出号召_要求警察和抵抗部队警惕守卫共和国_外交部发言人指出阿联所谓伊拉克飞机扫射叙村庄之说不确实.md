Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 16th: Iraqi Police Chief, Colonel Rashid Helemi, demanded on the 15th that the Mosul police force continue to perform its duties day and night, "not allowing conspirators and imperialists to have any opportunity in our beloved homeland."
	In a telegram to the Mosul police force, he thanked the police force for "the continued sacrifices made in coordination with the armed forces and the people to crush the conspirators and protect the borders of the republic."
	Helemi also sent this telegram to all police commanders, asking the police force to be more vigilant, strengthen defenses, and redouble efforts to protect the republic.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 17th: Iraqi People's Resistance Forces Commander, Colonel Bamarney, emphasized in an appeal to Iraqi citizens and foreign residents on the 16th: "The Iraqi People's Resistance Forces are organized to serve the people, maintain order, and defend the beloved and immortal republic to the last drop of blood."
	The appeal said that certain bad elements have taken actions against the Iraqi people. We express regret over the treacherous actions of this gang of traitors, agents of imperialism, carried out by such cheap means.
	The People's Resistance Forces request that Iraqi citizens and foreign residents report any such incidents to the responsible authorities in order to arrest these criminals and conspirators and bring them to justice.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 15th: A spokesman for the Iraqi Republic's Foreign Ministry issued a statement today saying that the allegation by the United Arab Republic authorities that two Iraqi aircraft strafed Syrian villages with machine guns is untrue. The spokesman said that this accusation is merely part of the actions launched by the United Arab Republic against the Iraqi Republic.
	The spokesman also said that some tribesmen from Syria are infiltrating and crossing the Iraqi border, attempting to carry out sabotage activities. The spokesman called the attention of the Syrian regional authorities to this situation and asked them to take appropriate measures to prevent such actions.

According to a Middle East News Agency dispatch from Damascus, Syrian regional officials once accused two Iraqi fighter jets of strafing a village in the Syrian region on the 10th.

    新华社巴格达16日电　伊拉克警察总监拉希德·赫勒米上校15日要求摩苏尔的警察部队继续日夜执行任务，“不让阴谋分子和帝国主义者在我们可爱的祖国内有可乘之机。”
    他在给摩苏尔警察部队的电报中感谢警察部队“在武装部队和人民配合下为粉碎阴谋分子和保护共和国边疆继续作出的牺牲”。
    赫勒米也把这份电报发给所有的警察司令，要求警察部队提高警惕，加强防范，加倍努力保护共和国。
    新华社巴格达17日电　伊拉克人民抵抗部队司令巴马尔尼上校16日在向伊拉克公民和外国居民发出的呼吁中强调说：“伊拉克人民抵抗部队是组织来为人民服务，维护秩序和保卫亲爱的和不朽的共和国而流尽最后一滴血的。”
    呼吁说，某些坏分子采取了反对伊拉克人民的行动。我们对这一帮叛徒、帝国主义的代理人用这种便宜的办法进行的叛国行动表示遗憾。
    人民抵抗部队要求伊拉克公民和外国居民向负责当局报告任何此类的事件，以逮捕这些罪犯和阴谋分子，并且对他们进行审判。
    新华社巴格达15日电　伊拉克共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明说，阿拉伯联合共和国当局宣称的所谓两架伊拉克飞机用机关枪扫射叙利亚村庄这件事是不确实的。发言人说，这种指责不过是阿拉伯联合共和国发动的反对伊拉克共和国的行动的一部分。
    发言人还说，叙利亚的一些部落人正在渗入和越过伊拉克边境，试图进行破坏活动。发言人提请叙利亚地区当局注意这种情况，并且采取适当的措施来阻止这种行动。
    据中东通讯社大马士革消息报道，叙利亚地区官方人士曾经指责说，两架伊拉克战斗机10日曾经扫射了叙利亚地区的一个村庄。
