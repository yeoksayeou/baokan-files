    Fight the First Battle Well for a Greater Leap Forward in Cocoon Production
    Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong Actively Prepare to Raise Spring Silkworms
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Province, which accounts for about half of the country's silk production, is making early preparations for cultivating mulberry gardens and adding/repairing silkworm rearing tools and building silkworm houses in all silkworm areas, striving for a greater bumper harvest of spring cocoons this year.
    In the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, which accounts for more than 80% of the province's total cocoon production, more than 600,000 mu of mulberry gardens have been fertilized with 1,000 to 1,500 dan of river mud per mu. The average amount of fertilizer applied has increased by more than 50% compared to last year. Pest control by scraping eggs, and branch trimming have also been done better than last year in this area. Therefore, the mulberry branches are more numerous and stronger this year. Recently, the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee held an on-site meeting in Deqing County, which achieved 1,000 jin of leaves and 100 jin of cocoons last year, and after promoting Deqing County's experience in high-yield silkworm and mulberry production, all counties in the prefecture quickly launched a production competition to strive for a bumper harvest of spring silkworms this year. At present, the 1,630 silkworm and mulberry professional teams newly established by the people's communes in the prefecture are actively preparing for raising spring silkworms. The prefecture has built and added 20,000 silkworm houses and 40,000 simple silkworm rearing trays, and also built 65 new steam sterilization stoves for silkworm diseases. All communes are preparing to start raising the first batch of spring silkworms around the Qingming Festival.
    People's communes in the silkworm farming areas of Ningbo, Jinhua, and Wenzhou prefectures are currently stepping up the cultivation of mulberry gardens and actively preparing for the construction of silkworm houses.

    Xinhua News Agency report: "To double the annual cocoon production, we must first pass the spring silkworm barrier" - Under the guidance of this idea, the preparation work for spring silkworm rearing in both old and new silkworm areas of Jiangsu Province has been done earlier and better than last year.
    In order to ensure that spring silkworms have a sufficient amount of "food", various regions have strengthened the field management of mulberry gardens, trying every means to produce more mulberry leaves. In new silkworm areas such as Xuzhou and Huaiyin, the field management experience of agricultural crops has been applied to mulberry garden management, with universal plowing, fertilization, and pest control to ensure that mulberry trees safely passed the cold winter. The Suzhou area, which is known throughout the country for its silkworm and mulberry production, has done a more refined job in the field management of mulberry gardens this year. The branch trimming of more than 130,000 mu of mulberry gardens in the entire prefecture has been basically completed.
    Various regions have also made preparations for silkworm houses, silkworm rearing tools, cluster grass, medicines, and fuel for heating silkworm houses. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of February, the province had prepared more than 154,000 silkworm houses.

    This newspaper reports: As the spring warms up, flowers bloom, and mulberry trees grow tender green leaves, more than 2 million silkworm farmers in Sichuan Province are rapidly launching a high tide of spring silkworm production, according to the province's goal of striving for "one season equals one year" (the output of spring cocoons in 1959 will reach 260,000 dan for the entire year of 1958). In order to fully guarantee the "food" for the silkworms, the province has carried out large-scale mulberry tree pruning and pest control. According to incomplete statistics from the Jiangjin Prefecture, more than 10 million mulberry trees have been pruned.
    The key silkworm areas and counties here are comprehensively reforming silkworm houses and silkworm rearing tools in order to strive to exceed the 100-jin yield mark over a large area. According to incomplete statistics from more than ten counties including Yanting, Langzhong, and Xichong, more than 13,800 silkworm houses have been rebuilt and newly built.
    All parts of the province are also actively carrying out the reform of silkworm and mulberry tools, aiming at the characteristics of tight rural labor.
    In order to ensure that silkworms are free from disease and death, and that each one can produce large cocoons, the province is actively preparing pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements such as penicillin, glucose, and magnesium sulfate.
    In order to resolutely implement the spirit of the National Silkworm Industry Production Conference, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture has decided to hold a provincial on-site meeting in Yanting County on March 18 to conduct an inspection of the preparations for spring silkworms, further boost morale, add measures, fill loopholes, and push spring silkworm production to a new climax.

    Xinhua News Agency report: The spring silkworm rearing work in Guangdong Province has already begun. In the past few days, more than 30,000 sheets of silkworm eggs have been raised throughout the province.
    This year, Guangdong plans to raise more than 130,000 sheets of spring silkworms for the first crop. To this end, various regions have been making preparations since last year. Based on the experience of the leap forward in silkworm and mulberry production last year, various regions are grasping both mulberry planting and silkworm rearing, striving for balanced development of silkworms and mulberries. At present, the province has expanded the planting of new mulberry fields by 60,000 mu, and also vigorously carried out field management work such as winter plowing and turning the soil, and applying spring bud fertilizer to the original mulberry fields. Therefore, the mulberry leaves in many areas are growing better than last year.
    Various regions have also made preparations for silkworm houses and silkworm rearing equipment, and have reformed the silkworm houses.

    打好蚕茧生产更大跃进的第一仗
    浙江江苏四川广东积极准备饲养春蚕
    据新华社讯　蚕丝产量占全国约一半的浙江省各蚕区为力争今年春茧更大丰收，都在提早进行培育桑园和添修蚕具、修建蚕室等工作。
    占全省蚕茧总产量80％以上的杭嘉湖地区，目前有六十多万亩桑园每亩已施河泥一千担到一千五百担。平均施肥量比去年增加50％以上。这个地区的治蟥刮卵、整枝剪梢也比去年做得好，因此，今年桑树枝条又多又壮。嘉兴地委最近在去年实现千斤叶百斤茧的德清县召开现场会议，推广了德清县蚕桑高额丰产的经验后，全专区各县很快掀起了争取今年春蚕大丰收的生产竞赛。现在，全专区各人民公社新建立的一千六百三十个蚕桑专业队正在积极进行饲养春蚕的准备工作。全专区已经修建和添置了两万间蚕室和四万张简易蚕匾，同时还新建了六十五座蚕病蒸汽消毒灶。各公社都准备提早在清明前后开始饲养第一批春蚕。
    宁波、金华、温州等专区的养蚕区人民公社，目前正在加紧培育桑园积极进行修建蚕室等准备工作。
    据新华社讯　“要得全年蚕茧产量翻一番，必须首先闯过春蚕关”——在这一思想指导下，江苏老、新蚕区春蚕饲养准备工作都比去年抓得又早又好。
    为了保证春蚕有足够数量的“粮食”，各地都加强了桑园的田间管理，千方百计地增产更多的桑叶。徐州、淮阴等新蚕区在桑园管理上，运用了农作物的田间管理经验，普遍进行翻耕、施肥和除虫，保证桑树安全渡过了寒冬。向以蚕桑生产闻名全国的苏州地区，今年的桑园田间管理比去年做得更加精细，全专区十三万多亩桑园的整枝、剪梢已经基本结束。
    各地对蚕室、蚕具、簇草、药品和蚕室加温用的燃料也都做了准备。据不完全统计，到2月底止，全省已准备好蚕室十五万四千多间。
    本报讯　在春暖花开、桑树长出嫩绿叶子的时候，四川全省二百多万蚕农正根据省提出的力争“一季顶一年”（1959年春茧产量达到1958年全年的二十六万担）的奋斗目标，迅速掀起春蚕生产跃进高潮。为了使蚕儿的“粮食”得到充分保证，全省开展了大规模的桑树修枝除虫。据江津专区的不完全统计，修枝的桑树已达一千多万株。
    这里的重点蚕区县，为了力争实现大面积超过百斤产量关，正在全面的进行蚕房、蚕具的改革。据盐亭、阆中、西充等十多个县不完全统计，改建和新建的蚕房已有一万三千八百多间。
    全省各地还在针对农村劳力紧张特点，积极开展了蚕桑工具改革工作。
    为了保证蚕儿不病、不死，条条能结大茧，全省正积极准备药剂和营养添食用的青霉素、葡萄糖，硫酸镁等。
    四川省农业厅为了坚决贯彻全国蚕业生产会议精神，已决定3月18日在盐亭县召开全省现场会议，对春蚕准备工作进行一次检查，进一步鼓干劲、添措施、补漏洞，把春蚕生产推向新的高潮。
    据新华社讯　广东省的春蚕饲养工作已经开始。最近几天全省饲养的蚕种已有三万多张。
    今年广东计划饲养头造春蚕十三万多张。为此，各地从去年开始就进行了准备工作。根据去年蚕桑生产跃进经验，各地今年都一手抓植桑，一手抓养蚕，力争蚕、桑平衡发展。目前，全省已扩大种植新桑田六万亩，对原有桑田也大力进行了冬耕翻土和追施春芽肥等田间管理工作。因此，很多地区的桑叶都比去年长得好。
    各地对蚕房和养蚕用具等也进行了准备，并对蚕房进行了改革。
