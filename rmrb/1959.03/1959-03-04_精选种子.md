Short Commentary

    Selecting seeds carefully is an effective and simple way to increase yield per unit area. Experiments at the East China Agricultural Science Institute show that selecting large-grain wheat seeds increases yield by 11% compared to unselected seeds. Farmers in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, further selected the "Early Three Hundred Rice Seeds" chosen from the fields, increasing production by more than 10%.

    Why can careful seed selection increase production? First, carefully selected seeds have larger grains and heavier weight, higher germination rates, and produce robust and complete seedlings, reducing the occurrence of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Second, some seeds carrying diseases and pests, as well as other debris, are removed, reducing the harm of diseases, pests, and weeds to crops.

    Many regions already have the habit of carefully selecting seeds. After communization, with more people, greater strength, and centralized and unified management, extremely favorable conditions have been created for carefully selecting seeds before sowing. However, some cadres directly leading agricultural production do not yet recognize the importance of careful seed selection, and therefore have not made good arrangements for this work. Selecting good seeds is one of the eight basic measures of agricultural production, occupying an important position in preparatory work. Only with excellent seeds and robust seedlings can other measures have something to serve. Although rural labor is relatively tight at present, careful seed selection is a light task that can be done by semi-laborers and children. As long as we pay attention to it, this work can be done well.

    Some people believe that "seeds bred in seed fields, and seeds selected from the field spikes, do not need to be selected again." Generally speaking, seeds that have truly been selected from spikes are of relatively pure quality; however, spike-selected seeds still have large and small grains, and it is of course better to find ways to select them again. Generally speaking, spike-selected seeds account for only a few percent of all seeds in a commune, and furthermore, the situation of communes not separating seeds from food grain is still common this year. Most of the seeds allocated by the state are selected from commercial grain and are generally not pure or good enough. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to carry out a careful selection before sowing.

    How to carefully select seeds? Some people's communes have adopted the method of "passing five barriers." That is, the seeds of one crop are simultaneously subjected to wind selection, sieve selection, mud and water selection, salt water selection, and finally, grain selection. Seeds selected in this way are, of course, very good seeds. However, doing so requires more manpower. Depending on the different crops, different regions, and the quality of the seeds themselves, taking one or two of these methods for careful selection can generally meet the requirements for improving seed quality. Large-grained seeds, such as soybean, cotton, and other crop seeds, and tubers, should be selected by grain or tuber depending on labor conditions. Seeds of very poor quality should be exchanged nearby before being carefully selected again.

    The season for spring plowing and production has arrived, and the work of carefully selecting seeds must be accelerated. All people's communes should act quickly, actively arrange, and ensure that every seed sown is a good seed, laying a good foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

### 精选种子

    精选种子
    精选种子，是提高单位面积产量的有效而简便的办法之一。华东农业科学研究所试验，精选大粒的小麦种子，比没有精选的产量增加11％。浙江省诸暨县的农民把田间穗选的“早三百水稻种”再行精选，增产10％以上。
    精选种子，为什么能增产呢？第一、精选过的种子，粒大体重，发芽率高，生长出来的幼苗肥壮齐全，缺苗断垅的现象少。第二、有些带病虫害的种子和其他杂物都被清理掉了，庄稼就能减少病虫和杂草为害。
    很多地区已有精选种子的习惯。公社化以后，人多力量大，管理集中统一，更为播种前精选种子创造了极其有利的条件。但是，有些直接领导农业生产的干部，还不认识精选种子的重要性，因而对这项工作没有很好地安排。选用良种是农业生产的八项基本措施之一，在备耕工作中占着重要地位。要有优良的种子，健壮的幼苗，其他措施才有服务的对象。目前农村的劳动力虽然比较紧张，但是精选种子是项轻活，半劳动力、少年儿童都可以做。只要重视了它，这项工作是完全可以做好的。
    有一些人认为“种子地里繁育的种子，经过田间穗选的种子，用不着再选了”。一般说来，真正经过穗选的种子，质量比较纯；但是穗选的种子也还有大粒的和小粒的，能再设法精选一下当然更好。一般地说，一个公社的全部种子，穗选的也不过占百分之几，况且今年各公社种子与口粮不分的情况还是普遍存在。国家调拨的种子，大部分又是从商品粮中挑选出来的，一般不够纯不够好。因此，在播种前进行一次精选是十分必要的。
    怎样来精选种子呢？有些人民公社采取“过五关”的办法。即一种作物的种子，同时采用风选、筛选、泥水选、盐水选，最后粒选。这样精选出来的种子，当然是很好的种子。但是，这样做要用较多的人力。根据作物的不同，地区的不同和种子本身的好坏等条件，采取其中一两种方法进行精选，一般就可以达到提高种子质量的要求。大粒的种子，如大豆、棉花等作物种子和薯块，应当根据劳力条件进行粒选、块选。质量很坏的种子，还要就近串换后再进行精选。
    春耕生产的季节已经到来，精选种子的工作必须加快进行。各人民公社应当赶快行动起来，积极安排，保证播种的种子粒粒都是良种，为今年农业生产更大跃进打好基础。
