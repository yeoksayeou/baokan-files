    Bumper Harvest of Sugarcane on the Thousand-Li Plateau
    Actively Transferring Sugar to Support the Entire Country

    (Our Dispatch) Yunnan Plateau's more than 500,000 mu of sugarcane has yielded an unprecedented bumper harvest, and this year, for the first time, a large amount of sugar is being transferred to support the entire country.

    Currently, it is the sugarcane harvesting season. On the thousand-li plateau, stretching from the Jinsha River in the north to the Honghe River in the south, sugarcane grows everywhere like forests, and the air is filled with the sweet aroma of sugar. Four mechanized sugar factories, more than 230 small-scale mechanized sugar factories, and thousands of native sugar presses are all operating simultaneously. According to the harvested areas, the average yield per mu has increased by about 30% compared to last year. Furthermore, the sugarcane planting area last year expanded by 73% compared to 1957. Therefore, excluding the amount retained for seeds, this year's sugar production is double that of last year, making it the year with the highest sugar production in Yunnan's history.

    The Yunnan Plateau has a subtropical climate, abundant rainfall in summer, and no major wind threats, making it suitable for sugarcane cultivation with very high yields. Sugarcane is produced in 91 of the province's 131 counties and cities. Last year, the Yuanjiang Farm had 13 mu of sugarcane with an average yield of 36,052 jin per mu, setting a national record. This year, the farm (now merged into the Honghe People's Commune) has 2.13 mu of sugarcane, now averaging 5.3 meters in height, with leaves reaching up to 7 meters, equivalent to the height of an ordinary building. The thickest stalks have a diameter of 5.6 centimeters, as thick as a teacup. The average weight of each stalk is 10 jin, with the heaviest reaching 15 jin. From a distance, it truly resembles a lush forest. After harvesting a small portion for measurement, the yield is estimated to be over 50,000 jin per mu.

    The people of all nationalities in Yunnan have a long history of cultivating sugarcane and have accumulated relatively rich experience. However, before liberation, the planting area was very small, only about 100,000 mu in the entire province, and sugar was produced using native methods, only producing brown sugar. Every year, white sugar had to be transported from provinces such as Sichuan. In recent years, Party committees and governments at all levels in Yunnan have vigorously promoted and supported sugarcane production, and the planting area has been expanding year by year, with continuous improvements in yield per unit area. At the same time, the state has invested in building four mechanized sugar factories in major sugarcane producing areas to produce white sugar, and has helped the masses to set up a large number of small-scale mechanical sugar factories and improve native presses. This year, in addition to being self-sufficient in white sugar, a large amount of brown sugar can also be transported to support other provinces. Around the Spring Festival, 20,000 tons of brown sugar have already been transported out.

### 千里高原甘蔗大丰收  积极调运食糖支援全国

    千里高原甘蔗大丰收
    积极调运食糖支援全国
    本报讯　云南高原五十多万亩甘蔗，获得空前大丰收，今年第一次大量调运食糖支援全国。
    目前正是收割甘蔗的季节，北起金沙江，南迄红河的千里高原上，处处甘蔗如林，糖香四溢。四个机械化的糖厂，二百三十多座小型机制糖厂以及数千个土榨糖机，同时运转。根据各地已收割的情况，平均每亩的单位面积产量比去年增产30％左右，再加以去年甘蔗种植面积比1957年扩大了73％，全省除留种外，今年产糖量比去年产糖量增加了一倍，为云南历史上产糖最多的年份。
    云南高原，属于亚热带气候，而且夏季雨量充沛，并无大风威胁，适合种植甘蔗，而且产量很高。全省一百三十一个县、市中，有九十一个出产甘蔗。去年元江农场有十三亩甘蔗，平均亩产三万六千零五十二市斤，创全国最高纪录。今年，这个农场（现已并入红河人民公社）有二点一三亩甘蔗，现在平均长到五点三公尺高，连叶子高达七公尺，约相当于一座普通楼房的高度。最粗的直径达五点六公分，有一个茶杯粗。平均每株重十市斤，最重的有十五市斤。远远望去，真像一片茂盛的森林。经收割小部分后测算，每亩产量可达五万斤以上。
    云南各族人民栽培甘蔗已有悠久的历史，积累了比较丰富的经验。但是，解放前，种植面积很小，全省只有十万亩左右，制糖都用土法，只能生产红糖，每年还需从四川等省运进白糖。近几年来，云南各级党委和人民政府大力提倡和扶持蔗糖生产，种植面积逐年扩大，单位面积产量不断提高。同时，国家投资在主要甘蔗产区兴建了四座机械化的制糖厂，生产白糖，并帮助群众大量设置小型机械糖厂及改良土榨。今年，除白糖可以自给外，还可运出大量红糖支援外省。春节前后，已运出了两万吨红糖。
