　　Refreshing and Original
　　Qin Mu

　　Works with high ideological and artistic quality have one characteristic: they always give people a refreshing and original feeling. A literary work that cannot give people a sense of novelty is a failure. Du Fu praised Li Bai's poems, saying "Freshness of Yu Kai-fu, and elegance of Bao Can-jun." In the stage performance of the Dream of the Red Chamber story, Lin Daiyu's aria includes lines like "Begonia Society competes for freshness." It can be seen that the importance of freshness and originality in literary works was discovered by ancient writers long ago.

　　Almost every representative work of each era, when it appeared, "refreshed people's minds and eyes." This was true of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," and "Dream of the Red Chamber." The artistic giants of our era also have many similar examples. Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman," "The True Story of Ah Q," and his essays and sketches, from content to form, can be said to be brand new literary creations. The same is true of Qi Baishi's paintings. This old painter has always been opening up his own artistic path in opposition to blindly imitating and blindly copying objects naturalistically. These giants' creative activities have always been opposed by conservatives, but their works, like fresh blood, are welcomed by the broad masses.

　　"Freshness" is a general adjective, but a closer examination reveals that its content is very rich. Why do some works give a sense of freshness, while others do not? The reason is none other than that those with particularly profound thoughts, particularly vivid descriptions of life details, and fresh and powerful language, when highly combined, make the work appear particularly fresh compared to similar works (works that are ideologically different are not even worth mentioning), but are of lower quality. The source of freshness is not only due to one factor, but to the combination of many factors.

　　Fresh language and fresh things can give people unusual feelings, thereby deepening the reader's thinking and impression. If we say that American capitalists are greedy and cruel, we get a general impression. However, when Gorky said, "They seem to have three stomachs and one hundred and fifty teeth," we get a fresh feeling based on that general impression. Describing the desolate scene of an autumn night garden, narrating "There are two jujube trees there," we get a very bland impression. But when Lu Xun writes in "Autumn Night" "One is a jujube tree, and the other is also a jujube tree," we get a fresh feeling.

　　The reason why good literary works often give a sense of freshness is that they describe concrete things and use fresh language.

　　Vivid and lively language enhances the freshness of literature, but language is only a tool for describing things. If the subject matter is thin and a lot of fresh vocabulary is used, it will only make people feel bored. Only rich content gives language room to gallop. Literature expresses concrete things, characters, and stories. Although they may sometimes be similar in the most general outlines (because things have generality, so such similarities are sometimes inevitable), they must be greatly different in every specific detail (because things have particularity, so profound descriptions must portray this difference). "There are no two identical grains of sand in the world." Detailed depictions can show their particular points. It is in these places that excellent literature gives people a sense of freshness.

　　Language and materials are all used to express a certain idea. When this idea is great and correct and can firmly grasp people's hearts, rich and lively language, fresh and vivid images can firmly grip people's hearts, and the strength of the sense of freshness affects the degree to which readers who can accept that idea resonate with it.

　　Therefore, paying attention to this point: that literature must give a refreshing feeling, is very important for literary creation. To achieve this, one must truly have correct and profound thoughts, rich life experience, and lively language. The author should also not avoid expressing their own personality (by writing about things through their own true feelings). As long as this personality is rooted in healthy commonality, it can be a good personality. If an author does not dare to pour their thoughts and feelings into their work, and does not dare to describe things in their own unique language, how can the work have fresh life? Not to mention those inferior works that imitate or are formulaic.

　　Freshness and originality should be advocated! The originality we require has nothing in common with the so-called "modernist" figures in capitalist countries who flaunt "originality." They want to break away from tradition, break away from life, and break away from the masses. The originality we require is based on correctly inheriting excellent traditions, delving into life, and breathing with the masses.

　　Real life is flowing day and night like the Yangtze River. Our era provides the richest material for literary creation. Marxist-Leninist thought is the most vital thought that stays young forever. Our artists are deeply involved in life and have very close relationships with the masses. Under these conditions, our literary and art circles should have, and will definitely have, works that are ideologically and artistically high, fresh, and original this year.

    清新独创
    秦牧
    思想性艺术性高的作品有一个特色：它总是给人一种清新独创的感受。文艺作品而不能给人一种新鲜感，那就是它的失败。杜甫称赞李白的诗写得好，就说“清新庾开府，俊逸鲍参军”。舞台上表演红楼梦故事，林黛玉的唱词里面有“海棠结社斗清新”一类的句子。可见，文艺作品贵有清新独创，古代的文人们已经老早就发现这道理了。
    差不多每一个时期的代表作，在它出现的时候都是“一新人们耳目”的。“三国演义”这样，“水浒”这样，“红楼梦”也是这样。我们时代的艺术巨匠，也同样地有不少的范例。鲁迅的“狂人日记”、“阿Q正传”，和他的杂文小品，从内容到形式，可以说都是崭新的文学创造。齐白石的画也是这样，这位老画家一直是在反对一味临摹和一味自然主义地照搬实物当中开拓出自己的艺术道路来的。这些巨匠们创造性的活动，一直受到保守者的反对，然而他们那些像流注着新鲜血液的作品，却受到广大群众的欢迎。
      “清新”是一个笼统的形容词，细察起来它的内容却是很丰富的。为什么有些作品给人一种清新感，有些作品却不能够？无他，凡是思想格外深刻的，生活细节描写特别生动的，语言新鲜有力的，它们高度的结合，就使作品较之同类（思想上不同调的作品根本不去说它了）但是等而下之的作品，显得格外清新了。清新的来源不仅仅是由于一种因素，而是许许多多的因素结合而成的。
    新鲜的语言，新鲜的事物，才能使人获得不同寻常的感受，从而加深了读者的思索和印象。说美国资本家贪婪残酷，我们听起来所得的是一般的印象，然而高尔基说：“他们好像有三个胃袋和一百五十颗牙齿”，这一来，我们获得的却是在一般印象的基础上的新鲜的感受了。描写秋夜庭园萧瑟的景象，叙述“那里有两株枣树”，我们所得到的只是一个很平淡的印象，但是鲁迅在“秋夜”一文中写成“一株是枣树，还有一株也是枣树”，我们获得的却是一种新鲜的感受了。
    好的文艺作品所以往往给人一种新鲜感，理由在于：它描写了具体的事物，运用了新鲜的语言。
    生动活泼的语言加强了文学给人的新鲜感，但是语言只是描写事物的工具，如果题材单薄，用上一大堆新鲜词汇，看了也只使人感到厌倦。只有丰富的内容，才使语言有驰骋的余地。文艺是表现具体事物的，人物，故事，尽管在最笼统的轮廓上有时可以近似（因为事物有一般性，所以有时难免出现这种近似），然而在各个具体细节上，必然大大有别
  （因为事物有特殊性，所以深刻的描写必然刻划了这种区别）。“世界上没有两粒相同的砂子”，细致的刻划就能表现出它们的特殊之点，正是在这些地方，使优秀的文艺给予人一种清新之感。
    语言、材料都是用来表达某一种思想的，当这种思想是伟大正确能够紧紧地抓住人心的时候，丰富活泼的语言，新鲜生动的形象就能紧紧地扣人心弦，清新感的强弱，也就影响了可以接受那种思想的读者思想共鸣的程度。
    所以，注意这一点：文艺必须给人以清新感受，对文学创作来说，是十分重要的。要做到这一步，就必须真真正正是有正确深刻的思想，有丰富的生活和活泼的语言。作者还应该不回避表现自己的个性（通过他自己的真正感受来写事物）。只要这种个性是生根于健康的共性上面的，它就可以是好的个性。如果一个作者不敢倾注他的思想感情到作品里面，不敢用自己独特的语言来描述事物，作品又怎能有新鲜的生命呢？更不用说那些模仿的、公式主义的下乘之作了。
    应该提倡清新独创！我们要求的独创和资本主义国家的那些所谓“现代派”人物所标榜的“独创”毫无共同之处，他们是要摆脱传统，摆脱生活，摆脱群众。而我们所要求的独创却是在正确地继承优良传统，深入生活，和群众共呼吸的基础上来进行独创。
    现实生活像长江大河那样日夜奔流着，我们的时代供给文艺创作以最丰富的素材。马克思列宁主义思想又是永保青春的最有生命力的思想，我们的文艺家又是深入生活和群众关系十分密切的。在这种条件下，我们文艺界今年应该有、也一定有思想性艺术性都很高的、清新独创之作。
