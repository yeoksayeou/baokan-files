    Create New Achievements, Strive to Go to Beijing, and Win Glory at the Gathering of Heroes!
    The Central Committee of the ChineseCommunist Party and the State Council have decided to convene a national conference of advanced collectives and advanced producer representatives in industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade in Beijing in the fourth quarter of this year. The decision to convene this conference comes at a time when our country is in the midst of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and the heroic sons and daughters of all walks of life, having achieved unprecedented great victories in 1958, are continuing to exert their utmost efforts and strive for excellence, advancing towards new and more ambitious goals. With the drums of war beating loudly and the momentum surging high, the news of the scheduled convening of the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producer Representatives in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade is a powerful encouragement. The notice states: "Enterprises and units in the above-mentioned systems that have made outstanding achievements in production, significant improvements in enterprise management, and contributions in the study of advanced science and technology and inventions through vigorous mass movements and technical revolution and innovation to improve labor productivity can send representatives to attend this conference." This will further motivate the millions of workers on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts to create more, better, and more outstanding achievements with greater enthusiasm to welcome this heroic gathering. We believe that the lofty aspiration of creating new achievements, striving to go to Beijing, and winning glory at the gathering of heroes will give the broad masses of workers throughout the country tremendous excitement and encouragement!
    The victory of our construction undertaking, like the victory of other undertakings, depends on the conscious efforts of the broad masses of the people. Marxism has always held that, in the final analysis, history is created by the masses of the people. The liberation of the masses must be won by the masses themselves, and the happy life of the masses must also be built by the masses themselves. The Party's leading role for the masses of the people is mainly manifested in correctly pointing out the direction of struggle for the masses of the people and helping the masses of the people to strive for and create their own happy lives. Therefore, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people are the most fundamental guarantee for the continuous development of our socialist construction undertaking; bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people is the most fundamental task of Party organizations. Why were we able to win the great victory of doubling the output of major products such as steel, coal, grain, and cotton in 1958 on the basis of "poverty and blankness"? The most fundamental reason is that the Party's general line for socialist construction and a whole set of policies for walking on two legs have fully brought into play the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. Why do we dare to propose even more ambitious goals for the leap forward on the basis of the high-speed development of last year? Do we not know that another high-speed development following the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production in the previous year is not an easy task? No, we know very well that only high speed every year and a great leap forward every year can fully reflect and satisfy our people's ardent desire to build socialism; and we firmly believe that as long as the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people are brought into play, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year can certainly be achieved. The notice of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on convening the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producer Representatives in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade is a call to battle. The broad masses of workers on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts should take more active actions, carry out socialist labor emulation more extensively and deeply, and launch a more massive upsurge in production and construction to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.
    The central link of the labor emulation is to vigorously carry out technical revolution and technical innovation and accelerate the improvement of labor productivity. To achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, we cannot rely on increasing manpower, nor can we simply rely on working overtime. At present, the manpower on the entire industrial front is not less, but more; it is not a question of absorbing workers from the countryside again, but a question of finding ways to save manpower to support the countryside. Our workers often go to work early and leave work late out of their enthusiasm for building socialism, and this conscious labor is of course very valuable. However, we should guide this valuable enthusiasm to technical innovation such as improving equipment, tools, technology, and design, and guide it to the overall goal of improving labor productivity. Only by carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation and accelerating the improvement of labor productivity can the labor emulation be sustained and production continue to leap forward. In carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation, we must give full play to the wisdom of the masses to solve key problems in production. Focusing on key production problems, adopting the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians to carry out technical revolution and technical innovation can ensure that the results of technical revolution and technical innovation quickly pave the way for fulfilling and overfulfilling the state plan.
    In the labor emulation, we must greatly promote the spirit of communist cooperation. Our emulation movement is a movement to learn from each other's strengths and make progress together. The purpose of the emulation is not to evaluate who is superior or inferior, or to compare who is higher or lower. Evaluation is only a means of emulation, and the purpose is to establish advanced banners, summarize advanced experience, and promote it to achieve common improvement. The most valuable thing about an enterprise or a producer creating an advanced level of production is not only that this enterprise or this producer creates much more social wealth than other enterprises or other producers; the most important thing is that the achievements of this enterprise or this producer can provide experience for other enterprises or other producers, so that they also have the possibility of reaching the same level. Therefore, it is very important to promote the spirit of communist cooperation in the emulation, and to advocate mutual learning and mutual assistance. In the great leap forward last year, the communist spirit of cooperation of the Chinese working class was further developed, and comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping others catch up with oneself have become common social practices. We must further promote this spirit of communist cooperation, so that the level of advanced collectives and advanced producers can be quickly popularized to the level of the whole society, and then advance together and improve even more on this new and improved level.
    Organizing the emulation is a very meticulous work. In recent years, with the development of production and the deepening of the emulation, the organizational forms of the emulation have also been diverse. But in analysis, there are only two categories. One category is inter-factory emulation, which mainly includes inter-factory emulation between the same industry and the same type of work, and inter-factory emulation between different industries and different types of work; the other category is intra-factory emulation, which includes emulation between workshops, between groups, between individuals, and between the same type of work. Intra-factory emulation is the basis of inter-factory emulation. Without inter-factory emulation, it is difficult for the emulation to become a broad social movement. Without intra-factory emulation, the foundation of inter-factory emulation will be very unsound. Therefore, in organizing the emulation, we must grasp both inter-factory emulation and intra-factory emulation, and focus on intra-factory emulation. In the emulation movements of previous years, we have also gradually accumulated a set of methods for leading the emulation, such as setting up pacesetters, proposing conditions, formulating measures, inspections, visits, evaluations, and so on. These are all effective experiences. In this year's emulation, we must also firmly grasp these links to make the emulation carry out in a down-to-earth manner.
    In order to welcome this gathering of heroes, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to workers throughout the country, calling on workers throughout the country to hold high the red banner of communist thought, discuss the state plan in depth unit by unit with the spirit of painstaking research and with the methods of great contending, great blooming, posting big-character posters, and great debates, formulate advanced indicators, take advanced measures, and universally launch an upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Let us use the ending of this letter to the workers of the whole country as the ending: "Comrades of all workers: This year is the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country, it is a year of greater leap forward, it is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle, we must warmly respond to the call of the Party and the government, in the socialist labor emulation, we must be high-spirited, spirited, and take out greater and better achievements and thousands of advanced deeds to dedicate to the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producer Representatives in Industry. We must guarantee to the Party and the government that we will complete and overfulfill the great plan of national production and construction in 1959 ahead of schedule and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward!"

    创造新成绩，争取上北京，群英会上争光荣！
    中共中央和国务院决定今年第四季度在北京召开全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。决定召开这次会议的时候，我们的国家正处在一个更大更好更全面的跃进中，各行各业的英雄儿女在取得1958年史无前例的伟大胜利之后，正继续鼓足干劲、力争上游，向新的更宏伟的目标前进。战鼓阵阵紧，干劲逐浪高，在这个时候传来全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议定期召开的消息，这个通知说：“在上述这些系统中的企业和单位，凡是在大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和技术革新，提高了劳动生产率，在生产上有突出成绩，在企业管理上有重大改进，在钻研先进科学技术和创造发明方面有贡献的先进集体和先进生产者，都可以选派代表出席这次会议。”这就必将进一步推动工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸各个战线上的千百万职工，用更大的干劲，创造更多更好更卓越的成就，来迎接这个英雄的盛会。我们相信：创造新成绩、争取上北京、群英会上争光荣的崇高志愿，将会给全国广大职工以万分兴奋的鼓舞！
    我们的建设事业的胜利，同其他各项事业的胜利一样，都取决于广大人民群众自觉的努力。马克思主义向来认为，归根到底，历史是人民群众创造的。人民群众的解放必须人民群众自己起来争取，人民群众的幸福生活也必须人民群众自己起来建设。党对人民群众的领导作用，主要表现为正确地给人民群众指出斗争的方向，帮助人民群众自己争取和创造自己的幸福生活。因此，广大人民群众的积极性和创造性，是我们的社会主义建设事业不断发展的最根本的保证；把广大人民群众的积极性和创造性发挥起来，是党组织的最根本的任务。为什么我们能够在“一穷二白”的基础上，赢得了1958年钢、煤、粮、棉等主要产品成倍增长的伟大胜利呢？最根本的原因，就在于党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，把广大人民群众的积极性充分发挥起来了。为什么我们敢于在去年高速度发展的基础上，又提出更加宏伟的跃进目标来呢？难道我们不知道，紧接着上一年工农业生产的高速度发展，再来一个高速度的发展，并不是一件轻而易举的事情吗？不是的。我们深知只有年年高速度，年年大跃进，才能充分地反映和满足我们的人民对于建设社会主义的热烈愿望；而且我们深信，只要把广大人民群众的积极性和创造性发挥出来，也一定能实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进。中共中央和国务院关于召开全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议的通知，就是一纸战斗的动员令。全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸各个战线上的广大职工群众，应当更加积极地行动起来，更加广泛更加深入地开展社会主义劳动竞赛，掀起更为巨大的生产建设高潮，为实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。
    劳动竞赛的中心环节是大闹技术革命和技术革新，加速提高劳动生产率。我们要实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，一不能靠增人，二不能单纯靠加班加点。目前整个工业战线上的人力不是少了，而是多了；不是再从农村吸收工人的问题，而是设法节约人力支援农村的问题。我们的工人出于建设社会主义的热情，常常早上班、晚下班，这种自觉的劳动当然是十分宝贵的。但是，我们应该把这种宝贵的热情引导到改进设备、工具、工艺、设计等技术革新方面来，引导到提高劳动生产率的总目标上来。只有开展技术革命和技术革新，加速提高劳动生产率，劳动竞赛才能持久，生产才能不断地跃进。在开展技术革命和技术革新中，一定要发挥群众的智慧来解决生产上的关键问题。围绕着生产关键问题，采用领导干部、工人群众和技术人员三结合的方法，开展技术革命和技术革新，才能使技术革命和技术革新的成果，迅速为完成和超额完成国家计划铺平道路。
    在劳动竞赛中，要大大发扬共产主义的协作精神。我们的竞赛运动是一个取长补短、共同提高的运动。竞赛的目的不在于评一个高低、比一个上下。评比只是竞赛的一种手段，目的是通过评比，树立先进旗帜，总结先进经验，并推而广之，求得共同的提高。一个企业、一个生产者创造了先进的生产水平，最可贵的地方，不只在于这个企业、这个生产者创造了比别的企业、别的生产者多得多的社会财富；最主要的还在于这个企业、这个生产者的成就能为别的企业、别的生产者提供经验，使他们也有可能达到同样的水平。因此，在竞赛中发扬共产主义的协作精神，提倡互相学习、互相帮助是十分重要的。在去年的大跃进中，我国工人阶级的共产主义协作精神有了进一步的发扬，比先进、学先进、赶先进和帮助别人赶上自己，已经成为普遍的社会风气。我们一定要更进一步地发扬这种共产主义的协作精神，使先进集体和先进生产者的水平迅速普及为全社会的水平，并在这个提高了的新水平上再共同前进，更加提高。
    组织竞赛是一件非常细致的工作。几年来，随着生产的发展和竞赛的深入，竞赛的组织形式也是多种多样的。但分析起来，也无非是两类。一类是厂际竞赛，其中主要是同行业同工种之间的厂际竞赛和不同行业不同工种间的厂际竞赛；一类是厂内竞赛，其中包括车间和车间、小组和小组、个人和个人以及同工种之间的竞赛。厂内竞赛是厂际竞赛的基础。没有厂际竞赛，竞赛就很难成为广阔的社会运动。没有厂内竞赛，厂际竞赛的基础就很不落实。因此，在组织竞赛中既要抓厂际竞赛，又要抓厂内竞赛，并且要以厂内竞赛为主。在历年来的竞赛运动中，我们也逐渐积累了一套领导竞赛的办法，如立标兵、提条件、订措施、检查、参观、评比等等。这些都是行之有效的经验。今年的竞赛中也还要抓紧这些环节，使竞赛踏踏实实地开展起来。
    全国总工会为了迎接这个群英大会，发表了一个告全国职工书，号召全国职工更高地举起共产主义思想的红旗，以刻苦钻研的精神，以大鸣、大放、贴大字报、大辩论的方法，一个单位一个单位地深入讨论国家计划，订出先进指标，采取先进措施，普遍掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进的高潮。让我们用这个告全国职工书的结尾来作结尾吧：“全体职工同志们：今年是我国国庆十周年，是更大跃进的一年，是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，我们要热烈响应党和政府的号召，在社会主义劳动竞赛中，昂扬斗志，意气奋发，拿出更大更好的成绩和千千万万的先进事迹，献给全国工业先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。我们一定要向党和政府保证：提前和超额完成1959年国家生产建设的伟大计划，实现更大更好更全面的跃进！”
