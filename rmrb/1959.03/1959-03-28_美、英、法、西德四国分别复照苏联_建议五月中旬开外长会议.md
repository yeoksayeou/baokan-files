Xinhua News Agency, 27th: After more than three weeks of back-and-forth consultations and intense talks, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany have finally reached a consensus on this point: suggesting that a meeting of Eastern and Western foreign ministers be held with the Soviet Union in Geneva on May 11.

The above-mentioned Western opinion was put forward in the replies issued separately by the four governments to the Soviet Union on the 26th. The Soviet government had sent notes to various countries on March 2, suggesting that a top-level meeting of leaders of Eastern and Western countries concerned be held to discuss the German peace treaty and West Berlin, as well as other issues related to easing international tensions. The Soviet government's note also pointed out that if Western countries were not yet prepared to participate in a top-level meeting, a foreign ministers' meeting of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia could be convened first to discuss the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue.

Worldwide pressure advocating the use of peaceful and rational attitudes to resolve international events has forced the West to express its willingness to sit at the negotiating table. However, when they were forced to make this choice, they reserved various conditions and had different plans and ideas.

When mentioning the agenda of the proposed East-West foreign ministers' meeting, the four Western countries expressed their opposition to the meeting only discussing the Soviet Union's proposed conclusion of a German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. The replies from the United States and Britain stated that the foreign ministers' meeting should discuss "issues related to Germany, including the German peace treaty and the Berlin issue." The French reply stated that the French government believes that the foreign ministers' meeting should "discuss the issues of Germany and European security." The West German government's reply clamored against the so-called "restriction" of the meeting's agenda, and it advocated that "the governments participating in the [meeting] should not be prevented from raising further questions directly related to the issues under discussion."

As for whether to hold a top-level meeting after the foreign ministers' meeting, the U.S. government reiterated its old tune in its note, insisting that the U.S. would only be "prepared" to participate in a top-level meeting when the development of the foreign ministers' meeting proved that there was "reason" to hold a top-level meeting. Britain said in its reply that if the development of the foreign ministers' meeting was considered to justify holding a top-level meeting, Britain would be "happy" to participate in a top-level meeting. France bluntly advocated that the foreign ministers' meeting must make so-called "real progress" before it would be willing to hold a top-level meeting, and it did not mention, as the United States and Britain did, that the top-level meeting could generally be held in the summer of this year. As for West Germany, it did not even explicitly state whether it was in favor of holding a top-level meeting.

Regarding the membership of the foreign ministers' meeting, the Western replies advocated that "at least at the beginning of the meeting, it should only include the four countries responsible for Germany." Although the United States, Britain, and France acknowledged that Poland and Czechoslovakia had "legitimate and direct interests" in the issues to be discussed at the foreign ministers' meeting, and that these two countries were "concerned about the resolution of some of the issues to be discussed at the meeting," the three countries insisted that the West only agreed to consider the possibility of "other countries" participating at "some stage" of the negotiations.

The Western replies also stated that they had noted that the Soviet government had agreed to their earlier proposal to invite advisors from the two Germanies to participate in the foreign ministers' meeting.

Western news agencies generally believed when commenting on the replies of the four Western countries that there were "great differences" in the wording and emphasis of the conditions for negotiations with the Soviet Union among the Western countries, and that these differences would be raised again for discussion at the Western Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting to be held in Washington next week.

### 美、英、法、西德四国分别复照苏联  建议五月中旬开外长会议

    美、英、法、西德四国分别复照苏联
    建议五月中旬开外长会议
    新华社27日讯　经过三个多星期的往返磋商和紧张会谈以后，美、英、法、西德四国政府终于在这样一点上达成一致的意见：建议5月11日在日内瓦同苏联举行东西方外交部长会议。
    西方的上述意见是在四国政府26日分别发出的给苏联的复照中提出的，苏联政府曾经在3月2日照会各国，建议举行东西方有关国家领导人最高级会议，来讨论对德和约和西柏林以及其他有关缓和国际紧张局势的问题。苏联政府的照会还指出，如果西方国家还不准备参加最高级会议，那么可以先召开苏联、美国、英国、法国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克等国的外交部长会议来讨论缔结对德和约和西柏林问题。
    世界范围的主张用和平和理智的态度来解决国际事件的压力，迫使西方不得不表示愿意坐到谈判桌旁来。但是，当它们在被迫作出这一抉择时，它们是保留有各种各样的条件的，并且各自有不同的打算和主意。
    西方四国在提到拟议的东西方外长会议议程时，表示反对这个会议只讨论苏联建议的缔结对德和约问题和西柏林问题。美英两国的复照说，外长会议要讨论“有关德国的问题，其中包括对德和约和柏林问题”。法国的复照说，法国政府认为外长会议应该“讨论德国和欧洲安全的问题”。西德政府的复照则叫嚷反对所谓“限制”会议议程的作法，它主张“不应该阻止参加
  （会议）的政府提出同讨论的问题直接有关的进一步的问题”。
    至于外长会议之后是否举行最高级会议，美国政府在照会中重弹老调，坚持要在外长会议的发展证明“有理由”举行最高级会议时，美国才“准备”参加最高级会议。英国在复照中说，如果外长会议的发展被认为举行一次最高级会议是有理由的话，英国将“乐于”参加最高级会议。法国直截了当地主张外长会议必需有所谓“真正的进展”，然后它才愿意举行最高级会议，并且没有像美、英两国那样提到最高级会议大体可以在今年夏天举行。至于西德，它甚至没有明确表示是否赞成举行最高级会议。
    外长会议的成员问题，西方的复照主张“至少在会议开始时只包括对德国负责的四国”。尽管美、英、法三国承认，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克对外长会议将要讨论的问题有着“合法的和直接的利益”，这两个国家是“关心会上将讨论的一些问题的解决的”，但是这三国硬说，西方只同意考虑这样的可能性，在谈判的“某个阶段”有“其他国家”参加。
    西方复照还表示，它们已经注意到苏联政府同意它们早先的建议：邀请两个德国的顾问参加外长会议。
    西方通讯社在评论西方四国的复照时普遍认为，西方国家对于同苏联谈判的条件的措词和强调程度有着“很大的不同”，这些分歧将要在下星期在华盛顿举行的西方四国外交部长会议和北大西洋公约组织会议上再次提出来讨论。
