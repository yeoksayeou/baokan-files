Increasing Production of Match Raw Materials

    China's largest red phosphorus production unit, the Red Phosphorus Workshop of the Calcium Carbide Plant of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, is producing red phosphorus in large quantities to meet the needs of the people's lives. Currently, a large amount of red phosphorus from this factory is shipped to match factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places every day.
    Red phosphorus is an essential raw material for the production of safety matches. The red phosphorus produced by the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant is not only large in quantity but also of good quality, with low moisture content, small particle size, and low acid content, which has been well received in the domestic market. Last year, during the technical revolution movement, the employees of the Red Phosphorus Workshop shortened the conversion time for producing red phosphorus, which had remained at 120 hours for decades, to 72 hours, more than doubling production capacity. This year, they will use last year's successful experience to continue to increase production capacity and improve the quality of red phosphorus without increasing equipment or manpower.

Weather Forecasts from Changbai Mountain

    Since the Changbai Mountain Tianchi Meteorological Station issued its first weather forecast to all parts of the country on October 1 last year, observation work has never been interrupted.
    The climate of Changbai Mountain has an important impact on the Northeast Plain. In order to obtain meteorological data from Changbai Mountain, the Jilin Provincial Meteorological Department established the first meteorological station on Tianchi of Baitou Mountain, at an altitude of more than 2,700 meters, at the end of September last year, and issued its first weather forecast on October 1.
    Changbai Mountain is covered with snow all year round, and the weather is constantly changing. Tianchi on the top of Baitou Mountain has low air pressure, thin air, frequent strong winds of level 12, and frequent fog and rain. Sometimes, if the observers are not careful, they will be blown away by the strong wind or lose their way in the thick fog. However, they step on the snow and climb to the top of the mountain along the wooden poles nailed to the snowdrifts, and insist on conducting twelve regular observations every day without interruption.
    All the comrades of the Tianchi Meteorological Station are working hard to find the preliminary laws of weather changes in Changbai Mountain in the short term, summarize the impact of Changbai Mountain's climate on the whole province, and continue to fight against nature.

Rural Earth Telephones

    Eighteen management districts and seventy-seven production teams in Liuhe County, Jilin Province, have installed a type of earth telephone suitable for rural areas, which is used to direct production.
    This type of earth telephone consists only of a speaking box and a 6V6 output transformer replacing the induction coil. Unlike ordinary telephones, it does not have earphones and uses wired broadcast loudspeakers to receive and transmit speech, and the sound quality is very good.
    The Liuhe County Party Committee attaches great importance to this creation and has decided to promote it widely throughout the county. The linesmen of the people's communes have all learned how to manufacture and install earth telephones, and soon all production teams in the county will be equipped with earth telephones.

Three Civil Aviation Routes

    The Jilin Provincial Transportation Department is currently actively preparing to open civil aviation routes within the province.
    The construction of Jilin Province's civil aviation network will be centered on the provincial capital, Changchun. This year, the initial plan is to open three routes: Changchun-Tonghua-Changbai, Changchun-Dunhua-Yanji, and Changchun-Baicheng. This will greatly shorten the distance between mountainous and remote areas and the provincial capital, Changchun, and promote the development of the province's economic and cultural undertakings. For example, it generally takes about six days to travel from Changchun to Changbai County by train and then by car, and at least four days at the fastest. If you take a plane, including the stopover time at the intermediate station, it will only take about four hours to arrive. As for traveling from Changchun to Baicheng, Yanji, and other places, it will be even faster.

    吉林新事
    增产火柴原料
    我国目前最大的赤磷生产单位——吉林化学工业公司电石厂的制磷车间赤磷工段全体职工，正在大量生产赤磷，满足人民生活需要。目前，这个厂每天都有大批赤磷发往北京、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨等地火柴厂。
    赤磷是生产安全火柴所必需的原料。吉林电石厂生产的赤磷不仅数量大，而且质量好，水分少，粒度小，含酸量小，得到国内市场的好评。去年，赤磷工段职工在大闹技术革命运动中，把几十年来一直停留在一百二十小时的生产赤磷的转化时间缩短到七十二小时，生产能力提高一倍多。今年，他们要运用去年的成功经验，在不增加设备和人力的条件下，继续提高生产能力和提高赤磷质量。长白山上预报天气
    长白山天池气象站从去年10月1日向全国各地发出第一次天气预报以来，观测工作从未间断过一次。
    长白山的气候对东北平原有着重要的影响，为了获得长白山气象资料，吉林省气象部门于去年9月底在拔海二千七百多公尺的白头山天池上建立起第一个气象站，并在10月1日发出了第一次天气预报。
    长白山终年积雪，气象变化无常。白头山顶的天池气压低，空气稀薄，经常有十二级大风，雾雨频繁，有时观测员一不小心，就会被大风刮走很远，或被浓雾迷失方向。但是，他们踏着积雪，沿着钉在雪堆上的木竿，爬到山顶，每天都要坚持进行十二次定时观测，从未间断。
    天池气象站的全体同志正在为短期内找出长白山天气变化的初步规律，并总结出长白山气候对全省的影响，继续与大自然搏斗。
    农村的土电话
    吉林省柳河县已经有十八个管理区和七十七个生产队，安装了一种适用于农村的土电话，用来指挥生产。
    这种土电话只由送话盒和代替感应线圈的6V6输出变压器组成，和一般电话机不同，没有耳机，是利用有线扩播喇叭来收听和送话，话音很好。
    中共柳河县委很重视这项创造，已决定在全县普遍推广。各人民公社的线务员已经都学会了制造和安装土电话的方法，不久全县各生产队都将安上土电话。
    三条民用航空线
    吉林省交通部门目前正积极筹备在省内开辟民用航空线。
    吉林省民用航空网的建设以省会长春市为中心，今年初步计划要开辟长春——通化——长白，长春——敦化——延吉，长春——白城三条航线。这将大大缩短山区、边远地区和省会——长春市的距离，促进全省经济文化事业的发展。如由长春市到长白县，乘火车后再转乘汽车，一般约需六天左右，最快也得四天才能到达。如果乘飞机，加上中间站停留时间，四小时左右，即可到达。至于由长春市到白城市、延吉市等地，那就更快了。
