    Both Strengthen Unified Leadership and Implement Tiered Management
    Important Principles in the Economic Life of People's Communes
    "A year's plan starts in spring." What is our country's major plan this spring? It is to rectify and consolidate the people's communes and to usher in a new high tide of even greater leaps forward. To realize this major plan, the most important thing in the current work of rectifying the communes is to implement the system of "unified leadership and tiered management" as pointed out in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This is a key issue in building good people's communes, and it is also a key issue in realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.
    People's communes are large in scale, wide in scope, with many people, many affairs, and many operations; they are both the organizers of people's production and the organizers of people's lives. There is no doubt that centralized leadership and unified arrangements are extremely important principles for the people's communes in organizing economic life. In order to effectively and rationally mobilize forces from all sides and maximize the advantages of the people's communes being both large and public, this principle must be resolutely implemented. However, this kind of centralized leadership and unified arrangement must be closely combined with a system of tiered management, so that we can, like the conductor of an orchestra, skillfully direct each member of the orchestra to play a beautiful, harmonious, and rhythmic score.
    To maximize the advantages of the people's communes being both large and public, the first requirement is to "make the best use of people's talents, make the best use of materials, and make the best use of land." To achieve this, it is necessary to earnestly implement the principle of adapting to local conditions and making rational arrangements. Our people's communes are mostly tens or hundreds of square miles in size, with thousands or tens of thousands of households. If we only pay attention to the "unified" aspect, assign tasks too rigidly, concentrate the use of manpower and materials excessively, and do not pay attention to tiered management or to giving play to the initiative and creativity of cadres at all levels and the broad masses of commune members, we will not be able to give play to the advantages of the people's communes being both large and public. We know that the universe is a diverse and unified universe, and the imbalance and differences between things are absolute. Economic life is very complex, and within a people's commune, the various management districts (or production brigades) and production teams have different specific conditions in terms of original production conditions, economic foundations, and the distribution of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. When the people's communes make unified arrangements for the production, exchange, consumption, and accumulation plans of the entire commune, they must both base themselves on the unified plans of the state and the principle of running the communes with diligence and thrift, and also base themselves on the specific conditions of the various management districts (or production brigades) and production teams, so that the various management districts (or production brigades) and production teams have a high degree of initiative and flexibility in adapting to local conditions in implementing the plans. Only in this way can we more correctly reflect the requirements of objective economic laws and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in our economic construction work. "The organizational principle of the people's commune is democratic centralism." We must not only implement democratic centralism in political life, but also in economic life. Unified leadership and tiered management are the concrete manifestations of implementing this principle, and they are also the concrete application of the Party's mass line in the leadership methods of building people's communes.
    Some people suspect that unified leadership cannot be implemented if tiered management is implemented. There are two kinds of unified leadership: one is the so-called "single" unified leadership, which denies the necessity of tiered management, neglects the enthusiasm of lower-level cadres and commune members, and does not take into account the specific conditions of production organizations at all levels. This is a subjective form of unified leadership. The other is unified leadership that is combined with tiered management and gives play to the enthusiasm of all sides under centralized leadership. This is in line with the principle of democratic centralism and is a unified leadership that follows the mass line. We resolutely oppose the former kind of unified leadership and advocate the latter kind of unified leadership. Unified leadership and tiered management are two contradictory aspects of a unified whole. They are contradictory, but they are also dialectically unified. We should not grasp one aspect and negate the other. Obviously, the reason why tiered management is implemented in the people's communes is precisely to better implement unified leadership; and to better implement unified leadership, it is necessary to earnestly implement tiered management.
    So, how can we more specifically implement the system of unified leadership and tiered management? At present, it is important for us to recognize the objective fact that the people's communes were established and developed on the basis of the original advanced agricultural production cooperatives. People's communes generally establish management districts (or production brigades) based on the original advanced agricultural production cooperatives, as the basic units for the current management of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, management of living and welfare undertakings, and general basic construction undertakings, and for organizing production, economic accounting, and product distribution. This is completely correct. The production teams under the management districts (or production brigades) are also necessary as grassroots organizations for organizing labor. Only in this way can we easily inherit and further develop the experience of the original advanced agricultural production cooperatives in management, facilitate adapting to local conditions, tap production potential, give play to the advantages of the people's communes being both large and public, and promote the gradual transition of the people's communes from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people.
    Only in the people's communes, by conscientiously implementing the system of "unified leadership, tiered management," with both centralized leadership and unified arrangements, and tiered management, properly dividing the management scope of production organizations at all levels; establishing a tiered economic accounting system, especially taking the management district (or production brigade) as the basic accounting unit, acknowledging the reasonable differences in income between teams and between individual commune members due to differences in the quantity and quality of labor and differences in the production base, can we better give play to their enthusiasm, can we fully utilize and further develop the foundation and experience of the original advanced agricultural production cooperatives in running the communes, can we rationally allocate and deploy labor, and can we effectively improve labor efficiency and work quality.
    (Excerpt from the editorial of Jiangxi "Leap Forward" Issue 6: "Conscientiously Implement the System of 'Unified Leadership, Tiered Management'")
    Fully Mobilize the Enthusiasm of the Masses
    The people's commune is a grassroots organization that combines government and commune. It is a whole, and unified leadership must be implemented. Whether it is the commune's annual plan or long-term plan, production plan or distribution plan, it should be uniformly formulated and supervised by the management committee of the people's commune; whether it is the labor force required for agriculture, industry, transportation, service industries, and other undertakings, there must be a unified and reasonable arrangement for the entire commune; the undertaking and management of commune-wide basic construction must also have unified leadership. The broad masses of commune members unanimously believe that the role of this unified leadership of the commune must be maintained and strengthened to further give play to the great superiority of the people's commune. In order to further improve the commune, we should of course strengthen the unified leadership of the commune in the future in accordance with the common requirements of the broad masses of commune members.
    To do a good job in the management and operation of the people's commune, it is also necessary to implement the method of tiered management under the unified leadership of the commune. What are the benefits of such a management system? Many cadres and masses, in the process of rectifying the commune, have already affirmatively answered these questions through research and discussion. In the course of research and discussion, cadres and masses further carefully studied the Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and, combined with the practical experience of various communes, put forward many practical and feasible methods for the management system, which will greatly help the further improvement of the people's commune system.
    The Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party also made clear provisions on the fundamental requirements of the commune management system. The resolution reads: "It is necessary to continuously improve the work of labor organization, continue to implement and consolidate the responsibility system of tiered contracting in production tasks and other tasks, improve the labor inspection and award system, and effectively ensure the improvement of labor efficiency and work quality." The "responsibility system of tiered contracting" mentioned in this resolution has now been concretized in the tiered management system after the practice of the broad masses of cadres and masses of the commune, and as a result of research and discussion based on practical experience.
    The tiered management system is premised on the unified leadership of the commune. Under this unified leadership, each management district of the commune has its own management rights such as economic accounting and production distribution, and at the same time, it should stipulate systems such as contracted work, contracted output, rewards for exceeding quotas, and financial contracting for the many production teams under its jurisdiction, and supervise their implementation. As for the various production teams under the management district, which are originally the basic units for organizing production, they should specifically arrange the production plans for each year, each quarter, each month, and each period in accordance with the above-mentioned contracted work and contracted output tasks, fully mobilize the masses, tap potential, and ensure the completion and over-completion of the contracted tasks; at the same time, they must more specifically manage production for the various work groups within the team, reasonably assess the wages or work points of each commune member, and reasonably assess and issue bonuses. This tiered management system fully meets the current actual needs.
    In short, by doing so, the enthusiasm of the commune, the management district, and the production team can be further brought into play, and production can be done better. This is of great significance for striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

### 既要加强统一领导  又要实行分级管理

    既要加强统一领导  又要实行分级管理
    人民公社经济生活中的重要原则
    “一年之计在于春”。今年春天，我们国家的大计是什么？就是整顿、巩固人民公社，掀起更大跃进的新高潮。要实现这个大计，在目前整社工作中，首先必须贯彻执行中共中央八届六中全会的决议中所指出的：“人民公社应当实行统一领导、分级管理的制度”。这是建设好人民公社的一个关键性的问题，也是实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进的一个关键性的问题。
    人民公社规模大、范围广，人多、事多、经营多；既是人民生产的组织者，又是人民生活的组织者。毫无疑问，集中领导和统一安排是人民公社组织经济生活一个极其重要的原则。为了有效地合理地调动各方面的力量，最大限度地发挥人民公社又大又公的优越性，就必须坚决贯彻这个原则。但是，这种集中领导和统一安排，又必须与分级管理的制度密切地结合起来，我们才能像乐队的指挥一样，得心应手地指挥乐队的每个成员演奏出优美、和谐、有节奏的曲谱。
    要最大限度地发挥人民公社又大又公的优越性，首先要求做到“人尽其才，物尽其用，地尽其利”。而要做到这些，就必须切实贯彻因地制宜、合理安排的原则。我们的人民公社的规模，多数是方圆十里、数十里，千户万人以上，如果只注意“统一”的一方面，布置任务过死，人力物力的使用过分集中，不注意分级管理，不注意发挥各级干部和广大社员群众的主动性和创造性，是不能够发挥人民公社又大又公的优越性的。我们知道，宇宙是多样化的统一的宇宙，事物的不平衡和千差万别是绝对的。经济生活很复杂，在一个人民公社内部的各管理区（或生产大队）、生产队中，原来的生产条件、经济基础以及工农商学兵的分布等等，都有不同的具体情况。人民公社在统一安排全社的生产、交换、消费和积累的计划时，既要根据国家的统一计划和勤俭办社的原则，又要根据各管理区（或生产大队）、生产队的具体情况，使各管理区（或生产大队）、生产队在贯彻执行计划中具有高度的主动精神和因地制宜的灵活性。只有这样，才能比较正确地反映客观经济规律的要求，使我们的经济建设工作取得又多又快又好又省的成效。“人民公社的组织原则是民主集中制”。我们不但在政治生活中要实行民主集中制，经济生活中也要实行民主集中制。统一领导、分级管理就是贯彻执行这个原则的具体表现，也是党的群众路线在建设人民公社的领导方法方面的具体应用。
    有人怀疑，实行了分级管理能不能实行统一领导？有两种统一领导：一种是所谓“单一”的统一领导，它否认分级管理的必要，忽视下级干部和社员群众的积极性，不照顾各级生产组织的具体情况，这是一种主观主义的统一领导。另一种是与分级管理相结合，在集中领导下发挥各方面积极性的统一领导，这是符合民主集中制的原则，走群众路线的统一领导。我们坚决反对前一种统一领导，提倡后一种统一领导。统一领导与分级管理是一个统一体的两个矛盾着的侧面，它们是矛盾的，但又是辩证的统一，我们不应该抓住一个侧面而否定了另一个侧面。很显然，在人民公社中所以要实行分级管理，正是为了更好地实行统一领导；而要更好地实行统一领导，就必须认真地实行分级管理。
    那么，要怎样才能更具体地实行统一领导、分级管理的制度呢？目前重要的是我们要认清这样一个客观事实，即人民公社是在原来高级农业生产合作社的基础上建立和发展起来的。人民公社一般都以原高级农业生产合作社为基础建立了管理区（或生产大队），作为当前分片管理工农商学兵、管理生活福利事业和一般的基本建设事业，进行组织生产、经济核算和产品分配的基本单位，这是完全正确的。管理区（或生产大队）内所属的生产队作为组织劳动的基层组织，也是必需的。只有这样做，才便于继承和进一步发挥原高级农业生产合作社经营管理的经验，便于因地制宜，挖掘生产潜力，发挥人民公社又大又公的优越性；促进人民公社逐步地由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制。
    只有在人民公社中，认真执行“统一领导、分级管理”的制度，既有集中领导和统一安排，又有分级管理、恰当地划分各级生产组织的管理范围；建立分级的经济核算制度，特别是以管理区（或生产大队）为基本核算单位，承认由于劳动的数量、质量不同和生产基础的不同而产生的队与队之间和社员与社员个人之间收入上的合理差别，才能更好地发挥他们的积极性，才能充分利用和进一步发展原来高级农业生产合作社的办社基础与经验，才能合理地分配、调度劳动力，才能切实提高劳动效率和工作质量。
    （摘自江西“跃进”第六期社论：“认真执行‘统一领导、分级管理’的制度”）
    把群众的积极性充分调动起来
    人民公社是政社合一的基层组织，它是一个整体，必须实行统一领导。无论全社的年度计划和远景计划，生产计划和分配计划，都应该由人民公社的管理委员会统一制定和督促实行；无论农业、工业、交通运输业、服务业和其他事业所需要的劳动力，非有全社统一的合理的安排不可；全社性的基本建设的举办和管理工作也必须有统一的领导。广大的社员们一致认为，必须维护和加强公社的这种统一领导的作用，进一步发挥人民公社的巨大优越性。为了进一步把公社搞得更好，我们今后当然应该按照广大社员群众的共同要求，加强公社的统一领导。
    要搞好人民公社的经营管理，还必须在公社的统一领导之下，实行分级管理的办法。这样的管理制度有什么好处呢？许多干部和群众在整社过程中，经过研究讨论，已经肯定地回答了这些问题。干部和群众在研究讨论中，进一步细心地学习了党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议，结合各个公社实践的经验，对于经营管理的制度，提出了许多切实可行的办法，这将大大地有助于人民公社制度进一步的健全。
    党的八届六中全会通过的关于人民公社若干问题的决议对于公社管理制度方面的根本要求，也做了明白的规定。决议写道：“必须不断地改进劳动组织工作，在生产任务和其他任务中继续执行和巩固分层包干的责任制，健全劳动检查和评奖的制度，切实保证提高劳动效率和工作质量。”这个决议中所说的“分层包干的责任制”，现在经过公社的广大干部和群众的实践，并且根据实践的经验加以研究讨论的结果，已经在分级管理制度中加以具体化。
    分级管理制度是以公社的统一领导为前提的。在这个统一领导下，公社的各个管理区各有自己的经济核算和生产分配等的管理权，同时对它们所属的许多生产队应该规定包工、包产、超额奖励、财务包干等制度，并且予以监督执行。至于管理区所属的各个生产队，本来是组织生产的基本单位，它们应该按照上面规定的包工、包产等任务，具体安排每年、每季、每月和每段的生产计划，充分发动群众，挖掘潜力，保证完成和超额完成承包的任务；同时对于队内各个作业组必须更加具体地进行生产的管理，合理地评定每个社员的工资或工分，合理地评定和发放奖金。这种分级管理的制度完全符合于当前的实际需要。
    总之，这样做，公社、管理区和生产队的积极性就能更进一步发挥出来，生产就能够搞得更好。这对于今年争取更大更好更全面的跃进，是有重大意义的。
