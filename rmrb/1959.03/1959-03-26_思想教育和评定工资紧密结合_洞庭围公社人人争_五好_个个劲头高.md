Combining Ideological Education with Wage Assessment
Dongtingwei Commune Residents Strive for "Five Goods," Full of Enthusiasm

    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 25th) The Dongtingwei People's Commune in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, combines democratic appraisal of wage distribution with the "Five Goods" commune member campaign, organically integrating socialist ideological education with material rewards. This has created a lively political environment in the entire commune, where everyone learns from and catches up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, pushing production to a new high tide.

    Starting in February of this year, the commune's Party committee, based on the opinions of the commune members and using the successful experience of work point recording in advanced agricultural cooperatives, adopted a democratic wage assessment method of "fixed grades, flexible wages, work point assessment, and wage distribution based on work points," which was well received by the commune members. During the mobilization of commune members for democratic wage assessment, the Party committee discovered a new situation: in the comparisons, everyone not only compared each commune member's completion of work quotas and the number of work points assigned based on the quality of completion, but also compared work attitude, protection of public property, and contributions to socialism. At the same time, with the surge in political enthusiasm, the work of democratic wage assessment became more detailed, which was more conducive to implementing the principle of "distribution according to work" and mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members. After summarizing this experience, the commune Party committee pointed out that socialist ideological education must be well integrated with wage assessment work.

    In the February wage assessment and distribution, they combined it with the "Five Goods" commune member campaign. The entire commune held 145 appraisal meetings and life meetings at the production team level, with more than 90% of adult commune members participating in the "Five Goods" commune member campaign. The entire commune selected more than 5,000 "Five Goods" commune members who had good work attitudes, good obedience to commands, good completion of work quotas, good work quality, and good love for the commune and protection of public property. "Five Goods" commune members not only received spiritual praise, but most of them also received bonuses and material rewards. In February, the entire commune extracted 20% of the total wage, or more than 8,000 yuan, as bonuses, and 4,685 of the more than 17,000 male and female commune members participating in the grading received bonuses. Commune members receiving spiritual and material rewards accounted for about 30% of the total male and female labor force, which had a great educational and inspiring effect on the commune members.

    During the February wage distribution, commune members Yao Peibo and his wife received bonuses for the third time. Originally, Yao Peibo was criticized at the wage assessment life meeting in November of last year. Because he was a second-level laborer, he should plow three mu of land per day according to the quota, but he only completed two mu, and the quality of his work was not good. Everyone assessed and reduced his wage by one yuan. He immediately expressed his intention to strive to become a model in the following month and launched a labor competition with his wife. In December of last year, Yao Peibo dug lotus roots in the Neihu, and according to the quota, he should dig 140 jin per day, but he averaged 220 jin per day. In December, both husband and wife overfulfilled their work quotas and were rated as good commune members, and both received bonuses.

    The combination of the "Five Goods" commune member campaign and wage assessment work in this commune is carried out under the unified leadership of the production brigade, with the production team as the unit. Generally, a life meeting is held every ten days, and a major appraisal is conducted once a month. At the life meeting, everyone checks work attitudes based on the daily attendance sheet. This attendance sheet is recorded daily by the production team leader, noting each commune member's attendance, completion of work quotas, labor work points, and completion of basic labor days. At the life meeting, everyone also conducts praise, criticism, and self-criticism. The production team leader records everyone's opinions as the basis for monthly wage assessment and selection of "Five Goods" commune members. Therefore, the process of democratic wage assessment is actually a self-education process of loving the commune and abiding by labor discipline. Through frequent mass democratic wage assessments, many commune members not only receive material rewards, but also reap a great ideological harvest. The ideological transformation of commune member Hu Changsheng is a good example. In November of last year, he was responsible for cultivating eight mu of rapeseed, and it was found during the inspection that three mu of rapeseed were "third-class seedlings." At the life meeting, everyone criticized him, and he检讨(jian tao) said: "If the big river has no water, the small river will also run dry. If the commune's harvest is not good, how can our own lives be good." He also assured everyone that he would eliminate the "third-class seedlings." In February of this year, another inspection showed that the rapeseed he was responsible for cultivating had many branches and abundant flowers. Now he has been rated as a good commune member and has also received a bonus. (Hu Jian)

    思想教育和评定工资紧密结合
    洞庭围公社人人争“五好”个个劲头高
    本报长沙25日电　湖南湘阴县洞庭围人民公社把民主评议发放工资和评比“五好”社员结合起来，把社会主义思想教育和物质奖励有机地结合起来，全公社出现了一个人人学先进、赶先进，先进更先进的生动活泼的政治局面，把生产推向了新的高潮。
    从今年2月份起，公社党委根据社员的意见，运用高级农业社评工记分的成功经验，采取“死级别、活工资、评工记分、按工分发工资”的民主评定工资的办法，深受社员欢迎。在发动社员民主评定工资时，党委会发现一个新的情况：就是大家在评比中，除了比每个社员应完成工作定额的情况，以及由于完成定额好坏而评定的工分多少；也比劳动态度、比爱护公共财产、比对社会主义的贡献。同时，在高涨的政治热情中，民主评议工资的工作越做越细致，更有利于贯彻“按劳分配”的原则，有利于调动广大社员的生产积极性。公社党委总结这个经验后指出，必须把社会主义思想教育工作和评定工资工作很好地结合起来。
    在2月份评议发放工资中，他们就是结合评选“五好”社员运动同时进行的。全公社以生产队为单位召开了一百四十五次评比会和生活会，有90％以上的成年社员都参加这次评比“五好”社员运动。全公社评选出劳动态度好、服从指挥好、工作定额完成得好、工作质量好和爱社爱护公共财产好的“五好”社员五千多名。“五好”社员不仅得到精神上的表扬，而且绝大部分人都领到了奖金，得到物质上的奖励。2月份，全公社从工资总额中抽出20％即八千多元作奖金，参加评级的一万七千多名男女社员中有四千六百八十五人领到奖金，全公社受到精神和物质奖励的社员约占男女劳动力总数30％，这对社员的教育和鼓舞作用很大。
    在2月份发工资时，社员姚佩波夫妇已经是第三次领到奖金了。原来在去年11月份评议工资的生活会上，姚佩波还受到批评。因为他是二级劳力，按定额每天应犁三亩田，他只完成两亩，工作质量也不好，大家评议减他一块钱工资。他当场表示要在下个月争取当模范，并向他的爱人发起劳动竞赛。去年12月份姚佩波在内湖挖藕，按定额每天挖一百四十斤，他平均每天挖二百二十斤。12月份夫妻双双超额完成了工作定额，都被评为好社员，两人都得到奖金。
    这个公社开展评“五好”社员和评议工资工作相结合，是在生产大队的统一领导下，以生产队为单位进行的。一般每十天开一次生活会，一月进行一次大评比。在生活会上，大家根据每天的考勤表，检查劳动态度。这个考勤表由生产队长逐日记下每个社员出勤、完成工作定额、劳动工分和完成基本劳动日等情况。在生活会上，大家还开展表扬、批评与自我批评。生产队长把大家的意见记录下来，作为月终评工资、评选“五好”社员的依据。因此，民主评议工资的过程，实际上是一个爱社教育和遵守劳动纪律的自我教育过程。通过经常的群众性的民主评议工资，许多社员不仅得到物质奖励，而且得到思想大丰收。社员胡长生的思想转变，就是一个很好的例子。去年11月，他负责培育八亩油菜，检查中发现有三亩油菜是“三类苗”。在生活会上，大家向他提出批评，他检讨说：“大河没有水，小河也会断流。公社收成不好，自己的日子哪能过得好。”他还向大家保证消灭“三类苗”。今年2月再次检查，他负责培育的油菜枝多花盛。现在他已被评为好社员，还得到了奖金。　（胡坚）
