Laying a Solid Foundation for Studying Cutting-Edge Science
The University of Science and Technology of China Achieves Excellent Results in Basic Theory Teaching

(Our report) In the University of Science and Technology of China, which is cultivating talent in cutting-edge science and technology, the majority of teachers conscientiously and responsibly guide students to learn basic theoretical courses well. The students are also studying diligently and practicing hard, seizing every minute. In the first exam, more than 70% of the students achieved a grade of Excellent or Good.

When this university was established last September, the school Party committee focused on the teaching of basic theory and political courses, believing that this was the foundation for students to tackle cutting-edge science in the future. The teaching plan requires students to learn basic courses such as political theory, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and foreign languages well in the recent two-plus years, and to participate in production labor for three months of the year. The content of each basic course in this school is relatively broad and deep. In order to save time, the four basic courses are progressing simultaneously in each department. This is a relatively heavy learning task for students who have just left middle school. Especially for the one hundred and thirty students from Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle Schools, who previously used four years to learn the six-year curriculum of regular middle schools, learning here is even more difficult.

The main lecturers for each course at the University of Science and Technology of China are mostly scientists from various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They are enthusiastically adopting various methods to help students learn deeply and thoroughly. Hua Luogeng, director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, teaches higher mathematics to students of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computing Technology. He takes the time to personally compile lecture notes suitable for the students' training in this department. When lecturing on some relatively complex and abstract theorems in class, he always uses the simplest formulas to connect to the knowledge that students learned in middle school to explain, so that students can easily understand the content of the course and improve their thinking ability. Zhang Sucheng, a teacher who teaches higher mathematics in the Department of Radio Electronics, is also a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics. At first, he did not understand the actual situation of the students, and only gave key and concise lectures in class. The students could not understand and were very anxious. At the teacher-student forum, the students reported their difficulties and anxious feelings to him. He said that he would definitely care for the students and improve teaching. The next day, he adopted the method of lecturing and asking questions. After finishing a paragraph, he would let the students ask questions. He would answer common questions on the spot, and individual questions separately after class. Sometimes students could not ask questions, so he would give questions for students to answer, and also list formulas for students to calculate on the spot. He and two teaching assistants guided back and forth in the classroom in different areas. The classroom was very active, and the teachers and students felt very close.

Scientists who teach physics, chemistry, and other courses here are also constantly improving teaching effectiveness. Zheng Linsheng, a researcher at the Institute of Physics, often solicits the opinions of tutoring teachers on his written lecture outlines before going to the classroom to teach students. Yan Jici, director of the Department of Technological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yu Hao, a researcher at the Institute of Geology, and Wang Baoren, a researcher at the Institute of Chemistry, personally went to relevant production sites to collect materials in order to help students understand some basic theorems in physics and chemistry in connection with production practice.

Many young teaching assistants also cooperated with these main lecturers to improve the tutoring work. For worker-peasant students, most departments have half a day a week for specialized tutoring. Most teaching assistants often take advantage of the opportunity to eat and work with students to understand their learning situation. They also often go to the self-study room to solve students' doubts and receive students who come to the office at any time.

The students studying here seize the time and work hard like workers standing in front of steelmaking furnaces, striving to improve the quality of learning. Most people have formulated a timetable for personal time allocation based on the school's unified timetable. They have also summarized the learning methods for each learning step, such as previewing, listening to lectures, reviewing, and doing exercises, by class. Mutual assistance was carried out on the basis of self-study. Worker-peasant students are more diligent in their studies. They write the newly learned formulas into big-character posters and post them in the self-study room for review at any time to enhance memory. Some students make mistakes in exercises. After the teacher points them out, they redo them until they are all correct. Some students encounter difficult problems in doing exercises. In order not to affect the progress of other subjects, they write the problems on slips of paper and put them in their pockets, taking them out to think whenever there is a gap. These students, with the patient help of the teachers, have become more and more confident after more than five months of study. As the students of the Department of Radio Electronics wrote in the new semester's study plan: "The more we learn, the clearer the direction, the more we think, the clearer the heart, the more humble we are, the more we progress, and the stronger our drive."

    为学习尖端科学打好根基
    中国科学技术大学基础理论教学成绩优良
    本报讯　在培养尖端科学技术人材的中国科学技术大学里，多数教师都认真负责地教导学生学好基础理论课程。学生们也以分秒必争的干劲在勤学苦练。第一次考试70％以上的学生获得了优或良的成绩。
    这所大学在去年9月成立时，学校党委就抓紧了基础理论和政治课的教学，认为这是学生们将来攻尖端科学的根基。教学计划中要求学生们在最近两年多的时间里学好政治理论课和数理化、外文等基础课，一年里有三个月时间参加生产劳动。这个学校各门基础课的内容比较广而深。为了争取时间，四门基础课在各个系里都同时并进。这对刚离开中学的学生来说是比较繁重的学习任务。特别是对一百三十个来自工农速成中学的学生，他们过去用四年时间学习了正规中学六年的课程，在这里学习困难也就更多些。
    中国科学技术大学各门课的主讲教师多数是中国科学院各个研究所里的科学家。他们满腔热情地采取各种方法帮助学生学得深学得透。中国科学院数学研究所所长华罗庚为应用数学和计算技术系的学生讲授高等数学，他抽出时间亲自编写适合这个系培养学生所需要的讲义，在课堂上讲到一些比较复杂而又抽象的定理时，他总是引用最简单的式子联系到学生们在中学里学过的知识来解释，使学生既容易理解课程的内容，又提高了思考能力。在无线电系讲授高等数学的教师张素诚，也是数学研究所的研究员。最初他不了解学生的实际情况，在课堂上只作重点扼要讲授，学生们理解不了，都很着急。师生座谈会上，学生们把自己的困难和焦急的心情向他作了汇报，他表示一定体贴学生改进教学。第二天就采用边讲授边提问的方法进行讲课。讲完一段他就让学生提问题，带有普遍性的问题他就当场解答，个别问题，课后单独解答。有时学生提不出问题，他就出题要学生回答，还列出式子要学生当场演算，他和两个助教分区在课堂里来回辅导。课堂上显得非常活跃，师生之间都感到非常亲切。
    在这里讲授物理、化学等课程的科学家也都在不断地提高教学效果。物理研究所的研究员郑林生，常常把自己写好的讲授提纲先征求辅导教员的意见，然后再到课堂上去教学生。中国科学院技术科学部主任严济慈、地质研究所的研究员余皓、化学研究所的研究员王葆仁为了帮助学生结合生产实际理解物理学和化学上的一些基本定理，他们亲自跑到有关生产现场去搜集资料。
    许多青年助教也配合这些主讲教师改进了辅导工作，对工农学生，多数的系每周有半天时间进行专门辅导。多数助教常常利用和学生在一起吃饭、劳动的机会了解学生的学习情况。并经常下到自习室去为学生解决疑问，并随时接待到办公室里来访的学生。
    在这里学习的学生就像站在炼钢炉前的工人那样抓紧时间刻苦钻研，为提高学习质量奋斗。多数人根据全校统一的作息时间制订了个人支配时间的作息表。他们还按班总结出了预习、听课、复习、作习题等每个学习步骤的学习方法。在自学为主的基础上展开了互助。工农学生在学习中更加刻苦，他们把新学的公式写成大字报贴在自习室里，随时复习，增强记忆。有的学生习题作错了，经教师指出后，就重新再做，直到一个不错为止。有的学生作习题碰到疑难问题，为了不影响其他功课的进行，就把问题写成纸条放在口袋里，一有空隙就拿出来思考。这些学生，在教师们耐心的帮助下，经过五个多月的学习，信心越来越强。正如无线电系的学生在新学期的学习规划里所写的那样：“越学方向越明，越想心里越明，越虚心越进步，越干劲头越强”。　　　（朱彬）（附图片）
