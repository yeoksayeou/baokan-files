    The Weihe Commercial Department Actively Promotes the Commune to Develop Diversified Operations
    Commune Production and Commercial Purchases and Sales Leap Forward Together
    (Our newspaper reports) The commercial department of the Weihe People's Commune in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, has adopted various methods to promote the commune's diversified operations, expanding commercial purchasing and sales on the basis of developing production, and commercial purchasing and sales in turn guarantees the further development of commune production. In 1958, the total income of this commune's diversified operations reached more than 3.22 million yuan, averaging more than 200 yuan per agricultural person in the commune; this year, the commune's commercial department has already signed contracts with 19 management districts and 13 specialized teams, with a planned purchasing amount reaching 4.29 million yuan.
    The Weihe People's Commune is located in a mountainous area, with good natural conditions for mountain harvesting, hunting, beekeeping, fruit tree planting, and livestock and poultry breeding. Starting from the development of commune production, the commercial department has adopted various methods to promote the commune's diversified operations. Last fall, two directors of the supply and marketing cooperative led eight cadres and experienced farmers into the deep mountains and old forests to survey sideline production resources, discovering more than ten places where a large number of valuable saplings and tree seeds could be collected, becoming an important project for the commune's mountain harvesting last year. This survey added more than 60 varieties to the original 120 varieties of mountain harvesting items. In the commune's large-scale water conservancy construction of digging ponds and building dams, the commercial department purchased 250,000 fish fry from various places, all of which were released by the commune. Recently, they have also purchased a large number of breeding pigs and rabbits to increase the means of production for the commune's livestock breeding. When the commune's diversified operations reached the peak season of production, in addition to actively doing a good job in the unified purchasing and sales of bulk products, the commercial department also actively organized mass-based decentralized purchasing, forming "five-member purchasing teams" composed of barbers, shop assistants, restaurant and hotel service personnel, supply and marketing cooperative purchasers, and commune livestock breeders, who went deep into the mountain villages by districts, combined with the masses, and visited homes to purchase decentralized sideline products.
    The Weihe People's Commune's diversified operations have developed to more than 100 varieties. There are "ten major breedings" in constant production: raising pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, poultry, fish, rabbits, bees, silkworms, and frogs. There are "ten major plantings": planting vegetables, fruit trees, wild strawberries, mountain grapes, ginseng, fritillaria, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, white melon seeds, and cultivating mushrooms. As a result of developing diversified operations, not only has the life of the commune members been improved, but also a strong force has been added to the commune's industrial and agricultural production, providing a large amount of means of production. According to the needs of the commune's production development, the commercial department used the income from the commune's diversified operations. In 1958 alone, it established seven medium-sized factories such as iron and wood farm tool factories and six small hydropower stations for the commune, and purchased two tractors and more than 100 dry-land weeding machines, more than 40 paddy field seeding machines, as well as various farm tools and more than 500 double-wheeled double-shared plows. As a result, the proportion of industry in the whole commune increased from the original 5% to 30%, thus basically realizing the electrification of lighting and the mechanization of processing in the whole commune.

    苇河商业部门积极促进公社发展多种经营
    公社生产和商业购销齐跃进
    本报讯　黑龙江省尚志县苇河人民公社商业部门采取各种办法促进公社多种经营，在发展生产的基础上扩大商业购销工作，商业购销工作又反转回来保证公社生产的进一步发展。1958年这个公社多种经营的总收入达到三百二十二万多元，按全社农业人口平均计算，每人有二百多元；今年，公社商业部门又已经和十九个管理区、十三个专业队订了合同，收购额达到四百二十九万元。
    苇河人民公社位于山区，采山、狩猎、养蜜蜂、种果树和饲养家畜、家禽都有良好的自然条件。商业部门从发展公社生产出发，在促进公社多种经营方面采取了各种办法。去年入秋时候，供销社的两名主任带领八名干部和老农一道进入深山老岭，勘察副业生产资源，发现了十余处有大量贵重树苗、树籽可以采集，成为去年公社采山的一个重要项目。这项勘察，使采山项目在原有一百二十种的基础上又增加了六十多种。在公社挖塘迭坝大修水利中，商业部门从各地采购进货二十五万尾鱼苗，全由公社放养起来。最近他们又购进大批的种猪、种兔，增加公社家畜饲养的生产资料。而在公社多种经营到了生产旺季，商业部门除积极作好大宗产品的统一收购和外销工作外，还积极组织群众性的分散收购，把镇市里的理发员、商店营业员、饭店和旅馆服务员、供销社采购员和公社畜牧员组成“五大员收购小组”，分片深入山村，和群众结合在一起，登门收购分散生产的副业产品。
    苇河人民公社的多种经营已经发展到一百多种，仅是常年生产的就有“十大养”：养猪、养马、养牛、养羊、养禽、养鱼、养兔、养蜂、养蚕和养蛙。有“十大种”：种菜、种果树、种草梅、种山葡萄、种人参、种平贝、种黄烟、种大麻、种白瓜籽和培养蘑菇。而发展多种经营的结果，不仅提高了社员生活，更为公社工农业生产增加了雄厚的力量，提供了大量的生产资料。商业部门根据公社发展生产的需要，使用公社多种经营的收入，仅在1958年内，就为公社开办了铁木农具厂等七个中型工厂和建立了六处小型水电站，购买了两台拖拉机和一百多部旱田除草机、四十多部水田播种机，以及各种农具，双轮双铧犁五百多件。使全社的工业比重由原来的5％提高到30％，从而使全公社基本上实现了照明电器化、加工机械化。
