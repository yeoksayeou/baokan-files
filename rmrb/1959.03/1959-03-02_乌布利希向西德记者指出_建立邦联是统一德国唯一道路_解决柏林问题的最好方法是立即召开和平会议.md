　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 1st. The "Neues Deutschland" published on February 28th a conversation between Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the editor-in-chief of the West German "Neue Ruhr Zeitung" on the German question and the Berlin question.

　　In the conversation, Ulbricht focused on the issue of establishing a confederation, believing that establishing an all-German confederation is the only way to restore German unity.

　　Ulbricht also expressed his support for the Soviet proposal to hold a summit conference of relevant countries to discuss and resolve major issues, and believed that the issue of a German peace treaty should be discussed at this conference.

　　Ulbricht said that we advocate taking a shortcut to establish a confederation and restore national unity. This shortcut is to convene a peace conference and conclude a German peace treaty. It can be seen that a German peace treaty will create a foundation for the peaceful resolution of the German question. The German people should rely on the treaty to end the threat of atomic war and the rule of militarists in West Germany, in order to achieve German reunification.

　　Ulbricht said that confederation means that the two Germanies should reach an understanding on some measures leading to German peace, so as to achieve reunification. This includes reaching an agreement on issues such as renouncing atomic armament, reducing armaments, abolishing foreign military bases, and the four countries withdrawing their troops. Then things can move forward.

　　Ulbricht pointed out that West Germany's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would be a condition for the establishment of a confederation, because NATO and the Paris Treaty prevent Bonn from taking any steps independently towards reunification. He said that we cannot participate in a confederation linked to NATO, and we expect that the West German government will not participate in a confederation linked to the Warsaw Pact.

　　When talking about the functions of the central body of the confederation—the All-German Conference—Ulbricht said that it has no right to issue orders to the parliaments and governments of the two Germanies; it can only make suggestions. He added that it should be possible to reach an agreement on the time and place for the All-German Conference to be held. For example, it can be held alternately in the democratic part of Berlin and somewhere in the Ruhr area.

　　When talking about the German peace treaty issue, Ulbricht said that signing a German peace treaty is a matter of paramount importance. If the treaty is concluded by the member states of the anti-Hitler coalition and the two Germanies that make up the confederation, the peace of the German people will have the best guarantee.

　　Ulbricht said that we believe that a summit meeting attended by responsible representatives of major powers should be held, and the issue of a German peace treaty should be discussed at this meeting. He also said that in a series of international conferences on the German peace treaty, it is a matter of course for representatives from both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic to attend together.

　　Ulbricht pointed out that Adenauer officially announced that he was in favor of holding a foreign ministers' conference because he thought that such a conference would not produce any results and would help cover up West Germany's atomic armament actions. Adenauer, Strauss, and Schröder want to hold foreign ministers' conferences for two years or more so that Strauss can complete his atomic armament plan at the same time. But no one will be deceived by such despicable tactics.

　　In answering questions about West Berlin, Ulbricht said that the best way to solve the Berlin problem is to immediately convene a peace conference. In the negotiations to sign a German peace treaty, it is easiest to reach a mutual understanding on the establishment of a demilitarized free city of West Berlin. If these countries want to solve the problem of eliminating this malignant tumor in West Berlin through other negotiation methods, we are also prepared to participate in such negotiations.

　　In the conversation, the editor-in-chief of the "Neue Ruhr Zeitung" believed that the West no longer demands "free elections" as the first and only step towards reunifying Germany, which shows that the West has changed its attitude. Ulbricht replied: "This change is not yet visible in the official notes from Western countries and the Adenauer government to the Soviet Union; at most, it is a change in tactics."

　　Ulbricht said that he could not accept the West's so-called "free elections." He said that before 1952, that is, until militarism was re-established in West Germany, the German Democratic Republic was always prepared for all-German elections, but Adenauer refused at that time. After West Germany has been militarized, the prerequisite for holding such elections is that, on the basis of a peace treaty, West Germany renounces atomic armament and cancels the positions currently held by former Hitler generals and judges in the Federal Republic of Germany. The sooner this prerequisite appears, the sooner the confederation and the German peace treaty will be realized, and the sooner all-German elections will be possible. For this reason, it is of course necessary to establish democratic relations in West Germany as well, that is, the basis for free elections.

　　Ulbricht said that according to the draft peace treaty, it must be guaranteed that all democratic parties and organizations can carry out free activities. This goes without saying that it means lifting the ban on the Communist Party of Germany, the Free German Youth League, the German-Soviet Friendship Association, and other democratic organizations. This also means allowing the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to operate in West Germany.

### 乌布利希向西德记者指出  建立邦联是统一德国唯一道路  解决柏林问题的最好方法是立即召开和平会议

    乌布利希向西德记者指出
    建立邦联是统一德国唯一道路
    解决柏林问题的最好方法是立即召开和平会议
    新华社柏林1日电　“新德意志报”2月28日发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希就德国问题和柏林问题对西德“新鲁尔报”主编发表的谈话。
    乌布利希在谈话中着重谈到了建立邦联问题，他认为，建立全德邦联是恢复德国统一的唯一道路。
    乌布利希并且表示赞成苏联所提出的举行有关国家的政府首脑会议来讨论和解决重大问题的主张，并认为在这个会议上应该讨论对德和约问题。
    乌布利希说，我们主张通过捷径来建立邦联和恢复国家统一。这条捷径就是召开和平会议和缔结对德和约。由此可见，对德和约将为和平解决德国问题创造基础。德国人民应该依靠和约来结束原子战争的威胁，结束军国主义分子在西德的统治，以便达到德国的重新统一。
    乌布利希说，邦联意味着两个德国应该在一些关于导致德国和平的措施上达成谅解，从而获得重新统一。这里面包括就放弃原子武装、裁减军备、取消外国军事基地和四国撤出它们的军队等问题达成协议。然后，事情就可以向前发展。
    乌布利希指出，西德的退出北大西洋公约组织将是成立邦联的一个条件，因为北大西洋公约组织和巴黎条约是不让波恩独立地朝着重新统一的方向采取任何一个步骤的。他说，我们不能参加同北大西洋公约组织有联系的邦联，我们料想西德政府也不会参加同华沙条约有联系的邦联。
    谈到邦联中央机构——全德会议的职能时，乌布利希说，它没有权利对两个德国的议会和政府发出命令，它只能提出建议。他又说，就全德会议举行会议的时间和地点达成协议应该是可能的。例如它可以轮流在柏林民主区和鲁尔地区的某处举行。
    乌布利希在谈到对德和约问题时说，签订对德和约是具有头等重要性的问题。如果和约由反希特勒联盟的成员国和组成邦联的两个德国来缔结的话，德国人民的和平就有最好的保证。
    乌布利希说，我们认为应当举行一个由各大国的负责的代表参加的最高级会议，对德和约问题应当在这个会议上讨论。他又说，在国际会议上的一系列关于对德和约的讨论中，德意志民主共和国和联邦共和国双方代表一同出席是理所当然的事。
    乌布利希指出，阿登纳正式宣布他赞成举行外长会议，这是因为他以为这样一种会议不会有什么结果，并且会帮助掩饰西德的原子武装的行动。阿登纳、施特劳斯和施罗德想要举行两年或者两年以上的外长会议，以使施特劳斯能够同时完成他的原子军备计划。但是没有人会受这种卑鄙的手法欺骗的。
    乌布利希在答复有关西柏林的问题时说，解决柏林问题的最好的方法是立即召开一个和平会议。在举行签订对德和约的谈判中，最容易对建立西柏林非军事化自由城市一事达成相互谅解。如果这些国家想通过其它谈判方式来解决消除西柏林这个毒瘤的问题的话，我们也准备参加这样的谈判。
    在谈话中，“新鲁尔报”主编认为，西方不再要求把“自由选举”当作重新统一德国的第一步和唯一步骤，这表明西方改变了态度。乌布利希回答说：“从西方国家和阿登纳政府给苏联的正式照会中，还看不出这种改变，顶多是策略改变了”。
    乌布利希表示不能接受西方的所谓“自由选举”。他说，在1952年前，即直到军国主义在西德重新建立以前，德意志民主共和国一向是准备全德选举的，但是阿登纳当时拒绝了。在西德已实现了军国主义化之后，举行这种选举的前提是在和约的基础上，西德放弃原子武装，撤消前希特勒将领和法官现在在德意志联邦共和国所担任的职位。这种前提出现得越快，邦联和对德和约实现就会越快，全德的选举就越早有可能。为此，当然有必要在西德也建立起民主关系，即自由选举的基础。
    乌布利希说，根据和约草案规定，必须保证一切民主党派组织自由活动。这不用说是意味着取消禁止德国共产党、自由德国青年联盟、德苏友好协会和其它民主组织。这也意味着允许德国统一社会党在西德活动。
