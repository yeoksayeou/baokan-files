Be Proactive Throughout the Year
Increase Production in Summer
Da Miao Shan Miao Autonomous County Issues Call to Action
Plant More Early Rice and Coarse Grains to Increase Yield Per Unit Area

Nanning, March 29th (by our newspaper) – The Da Miao Shan Miao Autonomous County in Guangxi is vigorously tapping potential, striving to make early harvests catch up with the whole year.

Based on the exploration of potential, the Da Miao Shan Miao Autonomous County has formulated this year's leap forward plan. The plan requires that the total grain output this year will double that of last year, with each person having 3,000 catties of grain. The county has warm weather in the first half of the year, coupled with good preparation for farming. Therefore, based on the spirit of promoting positive factors and overcoming unfavorable factors, the county party committee believes that there is a lot of potential to be tapped currently. For example, in terms of labor, the logging task has been completed, and a large number of laborers in forestry can be transferred; the labor engaged in industry and sideline occupations can be appropriately reduced, so that the labor force on the agricultural front can be increased from the original 60% to 85%. Vigorously carry out tool reforms, further promote cart usage in the plains, requiring each laborer to have a cart; vigorously develop aerial cableway transportation and bamboo and wood track transportation in mountainous areas, which can greatly improve labor efficiency. This creates conditions for expanding the planting area of ​​early rice and dry land crops, and better implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in order to increase yield per unit area. Therefore, the county party committee issued a loud battle call to the people of the county: "Strive to complete a year's plan in half a year." It believes that only by achieving a greater bumper harvest in the first half of the year can we ensure the better realization of the annual plan and win greater initiative in the work of the second half of the year. Therefore, the production in the first half of the year must be firmly grasped.

Under the guidance of this thought, after the county's communes vigorously publicized the significance of "striving to complete a year's plan in half a year," a new force emerged like a tide. In order to strive for higher and higher yields in early planting, all communes brainstormed ideas, and all teams explored potential, revising their plans with even greater enthusiasm. The first is to expand the planting area. The Xingdong Brigade of the Zhongzhai Commune originally did not plant thirty mu of land, but now it has all been plowed and harrowed in preparation for planting early rice. The Xinping Brigade of the Shanying Commune expanded the planting of spring corn, sorghum and other dry land crops by more than 200 mu. According to the revised plans of the county's communes, early rice has been expanded from more than 140,000 mu to more than 160,000 mu, accounting for 66% of all paddy fields. Early-maturing dry land crops have been expanded from more than 63,000 mu to more than 110,000 mu, and most have been planted.

Now the county's bumper harvest competition has developed from competition between communes and brigades to competition between small teams and individuals. In this fiery mass movement, the county party committee proposed to carry out the movement of upstream communes and upstream brigades. So that spring plowing production is like a rolling sea wave, with each wave higher than the last. (Gong Jingzhi)

    全年主动
    夏季增产
    大苗山苗族自治县发出号召
    多种早稻杂粮提高单位产量
    本报南宁29日电  广西大苗山苗族自治县大挖潜力，力争早造赶全年。
    大苗山苗族自治县在挖掘潜力的基础上，订出了今年的跃进规划。规划要求今年粮食总产量比去年翻一番，每人有粮三千斤。这个县上半年气候温暖，加上备耕工作好，所以县委本着发扬积极因素，克服不利因素的精神，认为当前可挖的潜力很多。如在劳动力方面，伐木任务已完成，林业方面的大批劳动力可以调出；从事工业、副业的劳动力可以适当减少，这样农业战线的劳动力就可由原来的60％增加到85％。大力进行工具改革，平原地区进一步推广车子化，要求每个劳动力一架车；山区大力发展空中铁索运输和竹木修道运输，劳动效率可以大大提高。这样就有条件扩大早稻和旱粮作物的种植面积，更好地贯彻执行“八字宪法”，以便提高单位面积产量。于是县委向全县人民提出了响亮的战斗号召：“争取一年计划半年完成。”并认为：只有上半年获得更大的丰产，才能确保全年计划的更好实现，才能赢得下半年工作更大主动。因此，上半年的生产必需狠狠的抓。
    在这一思想指导下，全县各公社大张旗鼓地宣传了“争取一年计划半年完成”的意义后，一股新的力量如潮水般地涌现出来。各公社为争取早造高产再高产，人人献计，队队挖潜力，纷纷修订计划，劲头更大了。首先是扩大种植面积。中寨公社兴洞大队原有三十亩田不种了，现在已全部犁耙准备插早稻。山鹰公社新平大队扩种春玉米、糁子等旱粮作物二百多亩。全县各公社修订后的计划，早稻已由十四万多亩扩大到十六万多亩，占全部水田66％。早熟旱粮作物由六万三千多亩扩大到十一万多亩，大部已种完。
    现在全县的丰产竞赛运动已由社与社、大队与大队发展到小队与小队、人与人之间的竞赛了。在这火热的群众运动中，县委又提出开展上游公社、上游大队的运动。使春耕生产如翻滚的海浪，一浪高一浪。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（宫敬之）
