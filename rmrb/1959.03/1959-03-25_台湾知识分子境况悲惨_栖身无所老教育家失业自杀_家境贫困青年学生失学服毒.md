Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, March 24th: Recent social news reports in Taiwanese newspapers have carried several stories of unemployed teachers and impoverished students committing suicide, reflecting the tragic circumstances of Taiwanese intellectuals.

The "Independent Evening News" published a story titled "Blind Elderly Educator Wu Baoren Commits Suicide by Poison, Suffering from Illnesses and Taking Refuge in Relief Home, Leaves Behind Heartbreaking Suicide Note, Saying He is Weary of the World," reporting that Wu Baoren, an elderly educator who served in the education field for more than twenty years and a graduate of the Education Department of National Central University in Nanjing, became ill due to hardship after arriving in Taiwan. In 1954, he lost his job due to blindness. From then on, he had no place to live and became a beggar. In 1956, he entered the Taipei Ai'ai Relief Home (an institution for beggars). Recently, Wu Baoren, suffering from numerous illnesses and lacking money for treatment, suffered a severe blow to his physical and mental health. Feeling that after devoting his life to education, he had fallen to such a tragic end, he felt utterly despondent. On the 16th, he committed suicide by taking a large dose of poison, leaving behind three letters before his death expressing the bitterness of the world.

Taiwanese newspapers report that at the Taiwan Provincial Taichung Commercial Vocational School, a female student named Fang Liangmei, 18, was repeatedly scolded and humiliated by the "tutor" sent by the Taiwan Kuomintang because her family was poor and unable to pay the school's "school construction donation." She was eventually forced to drop out. Unable to bear the shame and pain of losing her education, she recently committed suicide by swallowing a large dose of rat poison.

Taiwanese schools charge many kinds of exorbitant fees, making it difficult for people from poor families to study. Taiwan’s "Independent Evening News" said that Fang Liangmei's suicide "is a heartbreaking tragedy, reflecting the fact that behind the scenes of schools in Taiwan Province today, there are some base and ugly malpractices and chronic problems. Some scoundrels in the education field extort donations from students, which is even more fierce and ruthless than tax collectors urging donations or wealthy families demanding debts. They ask students for money morning after morning and chase them for money all the time, sneering and pressing them until they achieve their goals. If students from poor families are completely destitute and have no other option, they have to endure the pain of dropping out of school, and even incidents like Fang Liangmei protesting with her death occur."

Taiwanese newspapers report that another 17-year-old middle school student, Yan Deming, committed suicide by poison in Keelung on the 15th after his family had been without food for several days due to poverty.

    台湾知识分子境况悲惨
    栖身无所老教育家失业自杀
    家境贫困青年学生失学服毒
    新华社24日讯　台北消息：最近台湾报纸的社会新闻版中登载了几个台湾失业教师和贫穷学生自杀的消息，反映了台湾知识分子悲惨的境况。
    台湾“自立晚报”以“双目失明老教育家吴保仁服毒自杀，百病丛生栖身救济院，一念厌世遗书说凄凉”为标题，发表消息说：服务教育界二十余年的老教育家吴保仁，现年五十多岁，前南京中央大学教育系毕业，到台湾后因生活困难，忧劳成疾，在1954年因双目失明失业。从此栖身无所，沦为乞丐，1956年进了台北市爱爱救济院（收容乞丐的机构）。吴保仁近日因百病缠身，无钱治疗，身心遭受严重打击，觉得终身从事教育工作，竟落得如此悲惨下场，顿感万念俱灰，遂于16日服下大量毒药自杀，死前写下三封说尽人间辛酸的遗书。
    台湾报纸说，台湾省立台中商业职业学校，有一个名叫方良美的女学生，今年十八岁，因家境贫困，无力缴纳学校的“建校捐款”，屡遭由台湾国民党派遣的“导师”责骂凌辱，最后被迫退学。她因不堪羞辱和失学的痛苦，最近吞吃大量毒鼠药自杀。
    台湾学校收取的各种苛捐杂费很多，家境贫穷的人都不容易念书。台湾“自立晚报”说，方良美自杀“是一件令人酸鼻的惨事，由此反映出今日台省学校幕幛的后面，蕴藏着若干卑劣丑恶的陋规积弊，问题严重。一些教坛败类们向学生勒索捐款，真比税吏催捐，豪门索债，还要凶横凌厉。他们朝朝向学生索款，时时向学生追钱，冷嘲热骂，交相煎迫，不达目的，决不中止。家境贫困的学生，万一罗掘俱穷，无法可想，只好忍痛休学，甚至发生方良美以一死抗议的事件。”
    台湾报纸说，另一个十七岁的中学生严德明，因家庭贫困，断粮几天，15日在基隆服毒自杀。
