    新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克共和国人民在10日和11日继续在巴格达举行大规模的示威游行，表示支持政府和谴责企图阴谋颠复伊拉克政府的叛乱活动。
    示威群众手持卡塞姆总理的巨幅画像，高呼口号，谴责企图在摩苏尔发动叛乱的阴谋分子和卖国贼，要求惩办他们，并且表示决心为保卫共和国而贡献出自己的生命。
    游行队伍中有工人、青年、学生和其他阶层的人。
    在10日举行的大游行中，卡塞姆总理坐着汽车从国防部前往社会事务部，群众围绕着他，向他欢呼致敬，表示支持他和他领导的政府。
    新华社巴格达10日电　巴格达电台广播了驻扎在摩苏尔的新任第五旅旅长穆罕默德·塔赫尔的一封电报。电报说，这个地区的局势继续保持稳定和平静。
    新华社巴格达10日电　巴格达电台今天晚间广播了伊拉克军事长官艾哈迈德·萨勒·阿卜迪发布的一项命令。命令宣布，自10日起，摩苏尔城每天从晚上七时到次日早晨六时实行宵禁。开禁日期另行通知。
    新华社巴格达10日电　伊拉克军事长官艾哈迈德·萨勒·阿卜迪今天发表声明说：“一个属于某个外国的秘密电台自称为摩苏尔电台，广播对伊拉克共和国怀有恶意的消息”。
    声明说：“我们宣布，这个外国电台所广播的谎言和诽谤完全是不真实的。我们也不承认上面提到的这个电台在伊拉克境内存在。我们号召伊拉克共和国的公民不要收听这个为帝国主义服务的电台所广播的东西。”
    声明还说：“我们奉劝那个和帝国主义合作的国家停止这种阴谋、谎言和诽谤。这种作法会损害他们自己的名誉和破坏阿拉伯的团结，而不会对伊拉克共和国发生一点影响。”
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：伊拉克共和国驻联合国代表团在9日发表公报说，在颠复伊拉克政府的叛乱失败以后，“局势又恢复正常，安全有了保障，政府完全控制着全国”。
    代表团声明，沙瓦夫在3月9日早晨被他的士兵打死了。公报说，这个消息是代表团从伊拉克外交部那里接到的。
    公报指出，“阴谋已经被粉碎了，人民和军队的全体官兵显示了自己对共和国和卡塞姆总理的支持。”公报指出，目的在于反对伊拉克共和国政府而散布的谎话是“设在伊拉克领土以外的电台为了混淆国外视听”而制造出来的。
