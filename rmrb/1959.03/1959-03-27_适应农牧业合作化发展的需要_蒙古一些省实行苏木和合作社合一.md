Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar News: With the development of the agricultural and pastoral cooperative movement, some provinces in the Mongolian People's Republic have implemented the merger of Sum (county) and cooperative, and abolished the basic-level administrative organs of Bag (township).

According to the Mongolian "Truth Daily" report: Because all the herdsmen in many provinces with Sum (county) as the unit have joined the cooperatives, the existence of two levels of administrative organs in Bag (township) and Sum, as well as the management form of cooperatives, appears to be overlapping in institutions, affecting work efficency. The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers recently adopted resolution based on the new situation, stipulating the abolishment of the administrative organization of Bag in Bayan-Ulgii, Govi-Altai, Ovorkhangai, Arkhangai, Khuvsgul and Dornogovi provinces, and implementing the organizational management form of Sum-Cooperative. The administrative head of Sum is also the director of the cooperative, which can not only simplify administrative procedures, streamline institutions, and save expenses, but also enable cadres to further go into the masses and implement centralized leadership. This is a major measure to bring administrative leadership closer to economic work.

The "Truth Daily" recently pointed out in an editorial that the reorganization of local administrative organs is a new measure to consolidate cooperatives, help them settle down, and improve the material and cultural living standards of cooperative members.

    适应农牧业合作化发展的需要
    蒙古一些省实行苏木和合作社合一
    新华社乌兰巴托讯　随着农牧业合作化运动的发展，蒙古人民共和国有一些省已经实行苏木（县）和合作社合一，而撤销巴戈（乡）一级的基层政权机构。
    据蒙古“真理报”报道：由于许多省以苏木（县）为单位的牧民全部加入了合作社，同时存在巴戈（乡）和苏木两级行政机构以及合作社的管理形式，就显得机构重叠，影响工作效率。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和部长会议最近根据新的形势通过了一项决议，规定在巴彦乌列盖、戈壁阿尔泰、前杭爱、后杭爱、库苏古尔和东戈壁等省撤销巴戈这一行政组织，而实行苏木—合作社的组织管理形式。苏木的行政负责人同时是合作社社长，这样就不仅能够简化行政手续、精简机构和节省开支，而且还能使干部进一步深入群众，贯彻集中领导。这是使行政领导接近经济工作的重大措施。
      “真理报”最近在一篇社论中指出，地方行政机构的改组是巩固合作社并使其定居下来和提高社员物质和文化生活水平的新措施。
