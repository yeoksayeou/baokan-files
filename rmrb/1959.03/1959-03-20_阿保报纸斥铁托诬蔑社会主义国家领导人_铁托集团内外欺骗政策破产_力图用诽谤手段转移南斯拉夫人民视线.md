    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 19th - The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" ("Voice of the People") published a commentary on the 17th entitled "Conspiracy, Blackmail, and Threats are the Basis of the Policy of the Yugoslav Revisionists," criticizing Tito's speeches in Skopje and Belgrade, which slandered and attacked Albania and other socialist countries.

    The commentary pointed out that Tito's two speeches reflected the great failure and increasingly untenable position of the Yugoslav revisionists' policy of deception at home and abroad. The central content of the speeches was to incite hostility among the Yugoslav people towards the countries of the socialist camp.

    The commentary said that Tito's slander that the exposure and criticism of the Yugoslav revisionists by the Albanian and Bulgarian leaders was "acting according to external instructions" and "watching Moscow's gestures and winks" was an old tune.

    The commentary pointed out: Tito mentioned in his speech in Belgrade that Comrade Hoxha had declared in the Albanian parliament that he would accuse Yugoslavia in the United Nations. The commentary said that this was not true, and Comrade Hoxha's words were as clear as black and white on white paper. The commentary pointed out that this was a slanderous tactic consistently used by Tito. Tito had previously slandered Albania and Bulgaria for implementing policies of "national unificationism" and "chauvinism" against Yugoslavia.

    The commentary pointed out, in referring to Tito's threats against Albania, that Yugoslavia's threats to Albania by bringing accusations in the United Nations and severing diplomatic relations would not intimidate anyone. They themselves will bear full responsibility for any such actions.

    The commentary pointed out that the Albanian Labor Party and the Yugoslav revisionist group can never be reconciled, because this group is an enemy of Marxism-Leninism and an enemy of the socialist cause.

    The commentary also exposed the conspiracy of Tito's trip to Asia and Africa. The commentary said that the primary purpose of Tito's visit to many countries in Asia and Africa was to conduct hostile propaganda and activities against the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the socialist camp in these countries, and to try to get them to somewhat abandon or weaken their sincere friendship with the Soviet Union and China. But this mission suffered a shameful failure. No one took the words of this mouthpiece of imperialism seriously.

    Tito's second purpose was to bring the countries he visited together in order to facilitate the US imperialists' control of the economic and political leadership of these countries. However, this mission of this special envoy of the US State Department was also rejected by the leaders of these countries who were firmly opposed to colonialism.

    Tito's third purpose was to lead the people of these countries away from the Bandung policy of peace and bring these countries into a very suspicious political alliance that acted according to the wishes of the US State Department. However, this purpose was also met with contempt and rejection.

    Tito's fourth purpose was to spread "experience" and make "contributions" in opposing the Communist and Workers' Parties of these countries. The cruel attacks being carried out against the Egyptian and Syrian Communists, who are patriotic and firmly opposed to imperialism, prove this point. There have also been attempts to do this to the Iraqi Communists, but they have been thwarted.

    阿保报纸斥铁托诬蔑社会主义国家领导人
    铁托集团内外欺骗政策破产
    力图用诽谤手段转移南斯拉夫人民视线
    新华社地拉那19日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”17日以“阴谋讹诈和威胁是南斯拉夫修正主义者的政策的基础”为题发表评论，抨击铁托在斯科普里和贝尔格莱德发表的诬蔑和攻击阿尔巴尼亚和其他社会主义国家的演说。
    评论指出，铁托的这两次演说反映了南斯拉夫修正主义者的内外欺骗政策的极大失败和越来越站不住脚。演说的中心内容是为了煽动南斯拉夫人民对社会主义阵营各国的敌对情绪。
    评论说，铁托诬蔑阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚领导人对南斯拉夫修正主义者的揭露和批判是“按照外来的指令办事”，这是“看莫斯科的手势和眼色”的老调。
    评论指出：铁托在贝尔格莱德的演说中曾谈到霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚的议会上曾宣称要在联合国控告南斯拉夫。评论说，这不是事实，霍查同志讲的话如同白纸上的黑字，评论指出，这是铁托一贯使用的诬蔑手法。铁托从前曾诬蔑说阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚在执行反对南斯拉夫的“民族统一主义”和“沙文主义”的政策。
    评论在谈到铁托对阿尔巴尼亚所进行的威胁时指出，南斯拉夫用将在联合国对阿尔巴尼亚提出控诉和用绝断外交关系来威胁阿尔巴尼亚是吓不倒人的。对于任何这类行动，他们自己要负全部责任。
    评论指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党同南斯拉夫修正主义集团是永远不能调和的，因为这个集团是马克思列宁主义的敌人，是社会主义事业的敌人。
    评论还揭露了铁托亚非之行的阴谋。评论说，铁托访问亚非很多国家的首要目的是在这些国家进行对苏联、中国和社会主义阵营其他国家的敌对宣传和活动，竭力使它们多少放弃或削弱同苏联和中国的诚挚友谊。但这一使命遭到了可耻的失败。根本没有人认真听取这个帝国主义传声筒的话。
    铁托的第二个目的在于把他所访问的国家纠合在一起，以便利于美帝国主义把这些国家的经济和政治领导权掌握到自己手里来。但是，美国国务院的这位特使的这个使命也遭到了这些国家的坚决反对殖民主义的领导人的拒绝。
    铁托的第三个目的是使这些国家的人民离开万隆的和平政策，将这些国家纳入看美国国务院眼色行事的十分可疑的政治同盟。但是，这个目的也受到了鄙视和拒绝。
    铁托的第四个目的是传播“经验”，以及在反对这些国家的共产党和工人党方面作出“贡献”。正在对埃及和叙利亚共产党人进行的残酷的攻击就证实了这点，而埃及和叙利亚共产党人是爱国的和坚决反对帝国主义的。也有人曾企图对伊拉克共产党人这样做，但是碰了壁。
