Fujian: Transplanting Early Rice Seedlings Before Winter Wheat Ripens
Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 23rd: The busy season for transplanting early rice seedlings in Fujian Province has arrived a season earlier than in previous years. Formerly, people would harvest wheat and transplant rice seedlings simultaneously, but now it has changed to "transplanting early rice seedlings before the winter wheat ripens." As of March 20th, the province had transplanted more than 14,000 mu and directly sown more than 960,000 mu of early rice. In Longxi, Xiamen, and other regions with earlier seasons, transplanted and directly sown early rice already accounts for about one-third of the early rice planting area. The early transplanted and directly sown rice seedlings are growing lush and green, and some have already begun thinning and weeding.

This year, in order to ensure a longer growing period for the rice and fully utilize the land's potential, aiming for a greater early rice harvest, the people's communes throughout Fujian Province have launched a large-scale competition for deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, mud preparation, and seedling cultivation since last winter. As a result, spring plowing and production this year has presented a new situation of early action, fast progress, large quantity, and good quality. To date, agricultural water conservancy projects throughout the province have undergone new construction, expansion, and maintenance, and drought resistance capacity has generally increased by 20 to 30 days compared to last year. The newly added irrigated area reached more than 1.3 million mu; over 10.44 billion dan of household manure have been accumulated, a five-fold increase compared to the same period last year, and more than 6.5 billion jin of local fertilizer have been produced. Over 7 million mu of early rice fields throughout the province have generally implemented deep plowing and early mud preparation, with more than half being plowed and harrowed one or more times than in previous years, basically meeting the requirements of deep and soft soil. The early rice fine varieties prepared by people's communes this year are generally about double that of last year. Various regions have also established 90,000 specialized seedling cultivation teams to specifically responsible for seed selection, soaking, sowing, seedling cultivation, and other work. Therefore, even in cold and rainy weather, the seedlings grow thick stems and lush leaves, and rarely suffer from seedling rot, preparing sufficient strong seedlings for the comprehensive implementation of rational close planting this year.

In order to complete the transplanting plan for early transplanting and dense planting with quality and quantity, various regions have formulated various rational dense planting specifications according to different conditions such as soil quality, climate, fertilizer, and variety. The early rice that has already been transplanted and directly sown mostly meets the requirements of rational dense planting, and the number of effective panicles can generally be increased by about double compared to last year's early rice. In spring plowing and production, various regions also rationally arranged labor according to the urgency of the season and agricultural tasks, established specialized organizations for mud preparation and transplanting, and launched a tool reform movement. As a result, various major agricultural tasks are generally completed ahead of schedule, on time, with quality, and with quantity.

Guangdong: Rationally Dense Planting, Good Transplanting and Management
Xinhua News Agency: Millions of farmers in Guangdong Province are successively engaged in the intense battle of early rice transplanting. Under the slogan of "Transplant early, transplant well," people's communes in various regions are determined to pass the early rice transplanting stage centered on rational dense planting, striving for a greater harvest of early rice this year.

In order to strive for a greater leap in early rice production this year, Guangdong has launched a large-scale preparatory work since last winter. According to inspections in various regions before transplanting, basic farmland has been deeply plowed to more than eight cun; an average of more than 1,000 dan of basal fertilizer has been applied per mu; newly built and renovated water conservancy projects can guarantee against drought and flood; more than 90% of the early rice sown are fine varieties. In general farmland, the four preparation works of soil, fertilizer, water, and seeds have also been done better than last year.

Now, most of the early rice in Hainan Island, where spring plowing is the earliest, has been transplanted; the Chaoshan Plain, the Pearl River Delta Plain, and the Leizhou Peninsula and other places have also successively entered the busy season of transplanting. Before the start of transplanting, the province summarized the experience of dense planting of rice last year and decided that this year's early rice basic farmland should be planted with 500,000 to 600,000 panicles per mu, and general farmland should also be planted with 300,000 to 400,000 panicles per mu. Various regions strictly require that the seedlings be transplanted well according to the season, number of plants, number of seedlings, and depth. More than 1 million mu of early rice that has already been transplanted in Hainan, Shantou, Foshan, Zhanjiang, and other regions generally meet the specifications of rational dense planting such as one by five cun, two by five cun, and three by five cun, with five to ten seedlings per cluster.

In order to allow most of the early rice to avoid the rainstorm season as much as possible when it is heading and flowering, the leading organs of Guangdong Province require that the transplanting work in most areas must be basically completed around Qingming (April 5th).

Doing a good job of field management as early as possible, "managing one piece after transplanting one piece, ensuring that fields are managed by specialists and people have specific responsibilities" is a feature of early rice transplanting in Guangdong this year. According to the new situation of deep plowing and dense planting this year, various regions are prepared to take measures such as early topdressing, rational fertilization, early intertillage, early weeding, rational irrigation and drainage, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, and to start field management after the transplanting work begins. More than 100,000 laborers have now been fixed in Hainan Island, where transplanting was the earliest, to be specially responsible for field management work. As of the 8th of this month, more than 300,000 mu of early rice fields have undergone one to three times of intertillage, weeding, and topdressing. Guangxi: Launching Early Rice High-Yield Competition
Xinhua News Agency: A spring plowing and sowing movement striving for a bumper harvest of early rice is underway in various parts of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. At present, from the Guidong Plain to the Youjiang River basin, the old revolutionary base area, from Munankuan, the southern border of the motherland, to Guilin, where the landscape is the best in the world, 4 to 5 million people are leveling and deeply plowing the land and carrying out shock sowing every day on the warm and blossoming land. In the southern subtropical region with higher temperatures, 22 counties have begun transplanting rice seedlings, half a month earlier than in previous years.

This year, Guangxi plans to plant 12 million mu of early rice. In order to complete the sowing task ahead of schedule and ensure a high yield of early rice, the six special districts of the autonomous region have transferred forces from all aspects to strengthen the force of spring plowing and production. At present, tens of thousands of cadres who have been sent to the people's communes throughout the region to participate in labor training are working with the people of all ethnic groups to carry out early rice high-yield competitions between communes and teams. In order to strengthen the production leadership at the commune and brigade levels, Xing'an County sent 76 cadres from seven communes to the brigades and production teams, accounting for 50% of the total number of cadres in the commune. After adjusting the labor force, the number of people engaged in agricultural labor in Tiandong County increased from the original 60% to more than 80%.

This year, all regions have attached great importance to the quality of early rice sowing and transplanting work. All 8.6 million mu of seedling fields that have been sown throughout the region have used fine varieties and have been carefully treated. People's communes have also generally established specialized seedling cultivation teams to implement a special person management system. In Mubian County, many people's communes have achieved no sowing unless the seedling fields are leveled, no sowing unless the basal fertilizer is sufficient, and no sowing unless the seeds are good.

    南方地区插秧忙
    福建：冬麦未熟早稻插秧
    新华社福州23日电　福建省早稻插秧大忙已比往年提前一个季节到来，往年边割麦边插秧，现在已一变而为“冬麦未熟秧早插”。到3月20日止，全省已经插秧一万四千多亩，直播早稻九十六万多亩。季节较早的龙溪、厦门等地，插秧和直播的早稻已占到早稻种植面积的三分之一左右。早插和早直播的稻禾长得一片青葱，有的已开始间苗除草。
    今年，福建省各地人民公社为了保证稻禾有较长的生长时间和充分利用土地潜力，力争早稻更大丰收，全省四百多万农业大军从去年冬季开始就展开了声势浩大的深翻土、积肥、兴修水利、溶田和育秧等竞赛，因而使今年春耕生产出现了动手早、进度快、数量多、质量好的新局面。到目前止，全省农田水利工程都经过新建、扩建和培修，抗旱能力一般都比去年增加了二、三十天，新增加灌溉面积达一百三十多万亩；已积农家肥料一百零四亿四千多万担，比去年同期增加五倍，并制造了六十五亿多斤的土化肥；全省七百多万亩早稻田普遍实行了深翻和提前溶田，并有一半以上比往年多犁多耙一遍以上，基本上达到土深质软的要求。各地人民公社今年所准备的早稻良种一般都比去年增加一倍左右；各地并建立了九万个育秧专业队，专门负责选种、浸种、播种、育秧等工作，因此秧苗即使在天冷雨多的情况下，还是长得茎粗叶肥，很少发生烂秧现象，为今年全面实行合理密植准备了充足的壮秧。
    为了按质按量完成早插密植的插秧计划，各地根据土质、气候、肥料、品种等不同条件，因地制宜地按丘按片订出各种合理密植的规格，现在已插和已直播的早稻，绝大部分都符合合理密植的要求，一般有效穗数可以比去年早稻增加一倍左右。在春耕生产中，各地还根据季节和农事缓急，合理安排劳力，建立溶田、插秧等专业组织，并开展了工具改革运动，因此使各项主要农活一般都提前按时、按质、按量地完成任务。
    广东：合理密植插好管好
    据新华社讯　广东省千百万农民正在陆续投入紧张的早稻插秧战斗。各地人民公社在“早插秧、插好秧”的口号下，决心过好以合理密植为中心的早稻插秧关，力争今年早稻获得更大的丰收。
    为争取今年早稻产量更大的跃进，广东各地从去冬以来就展开了大规模的备耕工作。据各地在插秧前的检查，基本农田都深翻八寸以上；平均每亩已施基肥一千多担；新修和整修的水利工程，可以保证水旱无虞；已播种的早稻，良种占90％以上。在一般农田里，土、肥、水、种四项准备工作，也比去年做得更好。
    现在，春耕最早的海南岛大部分早稻已经插完；潮汕平原、珠江三角洲平原和雷州半岛等地，也陆续进入插秧大忙时期。开插前，全省总结了去年水稻密植的经验，决定今年早稻基本农田每亩插植五十万到六十万穗，一般农田每亩也要插三、四十万穗。各地都严格要求按季节、株数、苗数及深浅程度把秧插好。海南、汕头、佛山、湛江等地区已经插下的一百多万亩早稻，普遍达到一乘五寸、二乘五寸、三乘五寸等合理密植的规格，每蔸有五至十株苗。
    为使大部分早稻吐穗扬花时，尽可能地躲过暴雨季节，广东省领导机关要求大部分地区的插秧工作，务必在清明（4月5日）前后基本结束。
    及早作好田间管理，“插完一块管一块，做到田有专管，人有专责”是广东今年早稻插秧期间的一个特点。根据今年深耕密植的新情况，各地都准备采取早追肥、合理施肥、早中耕、早除草、合理排灌和防治病虫害等措施，从插秧工作开始后，就把田间管理抓起来。插秧最早的海南岛现在已固定了十万多名劳动力专门负责田间管理工作。到本月8日止，已有三十多万亩早稻田，进行了一次至三次中耕除草和追肥。广西：展开早稻丰产竞赛
    据新华社讯　一个争取早稻大丰收的春耕播种运动，正在广西僮族自治区各地展开。目前，从桂东平原到革命老根据地右江流域，从祖国南方边境睦南关到山水甲天下的桂林，在春暖花开的大地上，每天有四五百万人在进行平整、深耕土地，突击播种，在气温较高的南部亚热带地区，已有二十二个县开始插秧，时间比往年提早了半个月。
    今年广西计划种植早稻一千二百万亩。为了提前完成播种任务，确保早稻丰产，自治区六个专区都从各方面调集力量加强春耕生产的力量。现在，全区下放到人民公社劳动锻炼的数万名干部，正在和各族农民一起，开展社与社、队与队之间早稻丰产竞赛。兴安县为了加强公社、大队一级的生产领导，七个公社下放到大队和生产队的干部有七十六人，占公社干部总数50％。田东县经过调整劳动力，投入农业劳动人数由原来的60％提高到80％以上。
    今年各地对早稻播种和插秧工作的质量都十分重视。全区已播下的八百六十万亩秧田，全部采用了良种，并且都经过认真地处理。各人民公社还普遍建立了育秧专业队，实行专人管理制，睦边县许多人民公社在播种中，做到了秧田耙不平整不播、基肥放不足不播和种不好不播。（附图片）
