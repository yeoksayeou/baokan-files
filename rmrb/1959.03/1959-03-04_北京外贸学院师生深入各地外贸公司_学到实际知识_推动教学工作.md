The Beijing Foreign Trade Institute, in implementing the Party's education policy, has organized teachers and students to participate in practical foreign trade work, which has greatly promoted teaching work.

In mid-July of last year, all teachers and students of the school, except for first-year undergraduates and teachers who were old or sick, formed twenty-two teams and went to foreign trade companies in various places and the China Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou to participate in half a year of practical work. Rao Yusu, director and professor of the Foreign Trade Principles Teaching and Research Group, organized Wu Yongxun, deputy director and professor of the Technology Teaching and Research Group, and Wu Wenjin, associate professor of foreign languages, and other senior teachers to serve as business personnel or business team leaders in foreign trade companies. Some young teachers, for the most part, went to the countryside with the students to undertake the purchasing of export commodities. At that time, lower grade students had not yet taken foreign trade business courses, and although higher grade students had learned some, they had never applied it. The vast majority of teachers also lacked practical experience in foreign trade. When they first went down, although they were enthusiastic, their actual work ability was very poor and they had few methods. They put aside their airs and apprenticed themselves to veteran business personnel.

In the past six months, teachers and students have assisted relevant departments in managing more than 8,000 kinds of commodities (including duplicates between teams), averaging fourteen kinds per person. In organizing the purchase of commodities, they have initially mastered a complete set of operations such as the acceptance and grading of one or several commodities, organizing production and processing, transportation, packaging, delivery, payment, and signing contracts with production departments. Some students have also gained a relatively deep understanding of the production and processing technology of some commodities. For example, students from the Henan Livestock Team summarized the masses' rabbit-raising experience and wrote a book, which has been published and promoted in Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces. Students from the Xinjiang Team learned a set of techniques for capturing and raising muskrat and wrote a muskrat manual. Students engaged in foreign sales work have also initially learned a series of tasks from quoting prices and sending samples to concluding transactions and settling foreign exchange. Some students are now able to conduct trade negotiations and sign contracts independently. After students generally came into contact with commodities, the Party committee of the institute launched them to complete a survey of 10,000 kinds of commodities, a portion of which were of high quality. They conducted a more systematic understanding of the commodity's variety specifications, uses, storage and transportation, domestic production, and foreign sales market conditions. The nine students in the research class, under the guidance of teachers, wrote more than 80,000 words on a comprehensive survey report on four commodities: iron wire, iron nails, glass, and paper, which included more than 200 charts and graphs. As a result, it not only provided useful information for foreign trade departments, but also enabled students to systematize and rationalize the scattered direct knowledge they had learned in practical work to a certain extent.

After coming into contact with practice, teachers and students also found the direction and specific ways to improve teaching work. The commodity science course has always focused on the relatively large-scale export of food, mineral products, and native products. In fact, in recent years, China's foreign trade has developed greatly, and the proportion of industrial products and complete sets of equipment in export commodities has continued to increase. Now the proportion of industrial products has been increased accordingly in the commodity course. Foreign language was originally an important course in foreign trade majors, but in the past, it was not sufficiently integrated with the foreign trade major, which directly affected students' ability to handle affairs. In this business practice, foreign language teachers and students collected a large number of foreign trade vocabulary, jargon, and correspondence materials, and conducted on-site teaching at the same time. Students in one team working at the Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair, under the guidance of teachers, compiled a foreign trade business vocabulary, an English-Chinese comparative commodity name vocabulary, and a textbook on foreign trade and foreign guest reception, as well as four sets of foreign trade correspondence textbooks.

In the latter stage of the teachers and students' participation in practical work, the Party committee of the institute called on them to write papers, summarize their practical experience, and elevate it to theory. At the same time, they were mobilized to comprehensively express their opinions on the reform of the institute's training goals, curriculum settings, teaching content and methods, and so on. Teachers and students wrote more than 1,000 papers focusing on sixteen major aspects such as foreign trade work under the new situation of people's communes, and the cooperative relationship between foreign trade and production departments. These papers involved the main issues in the curriculum content of various teaching and research groups. After the teachers reviewed and evaluated them, it was initially determined that more than 60 of them were of good quality and would be published successively in the business publication "Foreign Trade Research." In the teaching rectification and airing of views, a total of more than 17,000 opinions on teaching work were put forward, which were richer than the previous airing of views, and many were active suggestions based on practical experience, which were of great help to further improving teaching work.

After the teachers and students returned victoriously from participating in business practice, they were full of energy. They have begun to analyze and study the more than 10,000 teaching rectification opinions. At the same time, each teaching and research group will hold a series of academic report meetings and discussions to discuss the more than 1,000 papers written by teachers and students, classify and edit them, and prepare to compile teaching materials together with teachers and students on this basis, to further improve teaching work.

    北京外贸学院师生深入各地外贸公司
    学到实际知识　推动教学工作
    本报讯　北京对外贸易学院在贯彻党的教育方针的过程中，组织教师和学生参加对外贸易实际工作，大大推动了教学工作。
    去年7月中旬，全校除本科一年级师生及年老多病的教师留在学校以外，其余师生组成了二十二个大队，到各地对外贸易公司以及在广州举行的中国出口商品交易会，参加了为期半年的实际工作。对外贸易原理教研组主任、教授饶毓苏，组织技术教研组副主任、教授吴永珣和外语副教授吴文金等老教师，在对外贸易公司担任了业务员或业务组长，一些年青的教师大部分和学生一起下乡担任出口商品的收购工作。那时，低年级学生还没有上过外贸业务课，高年级学生虽然学过一些，但从未应用过，绝大多数教师也都没有对外贸易实际工作经验，刚下放时，他们干劲虽大，实际工作能力却很差，办法很少，就放下架子，拜老业务员为师。
    半年来，师生们协助有关部门经营了八千多种商品（包括各队之间的重复数），平均每人经营了十四种。在组织商品收购中，他们初步掌握了一种或几种商品的验收、分级，组织生产和加工、运输、包装、发货、付款，和生产部门签订合同等一整套业务。有些学生还比较深入地掌握了一些商品的生产和加工技术，如河南畜产队学生总结了群众的养兔经验写出了书，已经出版，并在湖北、河南、江西三省推广。新疆队学生学会了一套捕捉和饲养麝鼠的技术，写成了麝鼠手册。作外销工作的学生也初步学会了由报价，送样品到成交、结汇等一系列工作。有些学生已能单独对外谈交易和签订合同。在学生普遍接触商品以后，学院党委又发动他们完成了万种商品调查，其中有一部分调查质量较高，对商品的品种规格、用途、储运、国内生产及国外销售市场情况进行了比较系统的了解。研究班的九个学生在教师指导下对铁丝、铁钉、玻璃、纸张四种商品的全面调查报告，就写出了八万多字，还附有二百多件图表资料。这样做的结果，不仅为对外贸易部门提供了有用的资料，而且使学生在实际工作中学到的零星的直接知识得到一定程度的系统化和条理化。
    接触实际后，师生们也找到了提高教学工作的方向和具体途径。商品学课程过去讲的一直是以比较大宗出口的食品、矿产品、土特产品为主，实际上几年来我国对外贸易有了很大发展，出口商品中，工业品和成套设备不断增加。现在商品课中相应地增加了工业品的比重。外贸专业中外语原是一门重要课程，但是过去教学中结合外贸专业不够，直接影响学生的办事能力。在这次业务实践中，外语教师和学生们一道搜集了大量外贸辞汇、行话和函电资料，同时进行现场教学。仅在广州出口商品交易会工作的一个队的学生就在教师指导下编出了外贸业务辞汇、英汉对照商品名称辞汇、外贸外宾招待会话教材各一部，外贸函电教材四套。
    在师生们参加实际工作的后一阶段，学院党委号召他们写论文，将实际经验加以总结，提高到理论。同时发动他们对学院的培养目标、课程设置、教学内容和方法等等方面的改革工作全面鸣放提意见。师生们围绕着人民公社化新形势下的对外贸易工作，对外贸易和生产部门的协作关系等十六个重大方面的问题写出了论文一千多篇。这些论文涉及到各教研组课程内容中的主要问题。经教师们审查评比，初步确定质量较好，准备陆续在业务刊物“对外贸易研究”上发表的已有六十多篇。在教学整改鸣放中，一共提出了一万七千多条对教学工作的意见，比过去几次鸣放都更为丰富，有不少是根据实际体会提出的积极建议，对进一步提高教学工作有很大帮助。
    师生们参加业务实践胜利归来后，干劲十足，他们已经开始对一万多条教学整改意见进行分析和研究。同时各教研组都将举行一系列的学术报告会和讨论会，讨论师生们写出的一千多篇论文，分类进行编辑加工，并准备在这个基础上，师生合作大编教材，进一步提高教学工作。
