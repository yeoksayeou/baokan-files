    Sitting on the Ground, Patrolling the Sky, and Other Matters
    Guo Moruo

    Regarding some issues in current poetry, my answers to the editors of "Poetry Magazine," which were reprinted in the "People's Daily" (February 13th), made me carefully read the entire article twice more. I found two inappropriate points that I need to correct myself to avoid the spread of misinformation.

    The first point concerns sitting on the ground and patrolling the sky:

    Chairman Mao's "Farewell to the God of Plague" first poem, lines five and six, "Sitting on the ground, traveling eighty thousand miles a day, patrolling the sky and gazing at a thousand rivers," refer to the Earth's rotation and revolution, which is certain. Since this is confirmed, then every person living on Earth is carried by the Earth's rotation and revolution every day and night, meaning everyone is "sitting on the ground, traveling eighty thousand miles a day, patrolling the sky and gazing at a thousand rivers." However, I made further far-fetched explanations. I interpreted it as people sitting on the ground not working, or people staying up all night indulging in pleasure, taking a leisurely tour in the sky; I even involved the stories of King Mu of Zhou's eight steeds traveling around and Emperor Ming of Tang's joyous tour of the moon palace. In reality, even working people are "traveling eighty thousand miles a day"; there's no need to stay up all night, people can always see the starry sky at night, which is "gazing at a thousand rivers." My explanation in response to "Poetry Magazine's" questions has logical problems and is indeed far-fetched.

    The reason I came up with this inappropriate explanation is that I was fixated on the word "joy," trying to substantiate the word "joy" in the poem; this was actually unnecessary. In the old days, the joy of the parasitic classes was built on the sorrow of the laboring people. Writing about the people's inability to make a living also highlighted not only blood-sucking insects but also blood-sucking people.

    As for who the subject of sitting on the ground and patrolling the sky actually is, a closer look at the entire poem reveals that it is actually the author himself. The omission of the first-person pronoun is common in poetry. After lamenting the harm of schistosomiasis, when the author imagines himself sitting on the ground, patrolling the sky, and gazing at the starry river, he often sees the Cowherd (Altair), who was originally a farmer, and might be asked about the situation in his hometown, whether the God of Plague is still rampant. In this imagined dialogue, the author answers: In the thousands of years since the Cowherd left the human world, although the waves of time have passed, the old ways of a class society, where the sad are sad and the joyous are joyous, have continued. But all of this is talking about the past. The end of the first poem also ends the image of the old era. When the author reads the "People's Daily" report and "gazes at the southern sky," it is as if the rising sun is shining through the window, and the spring breeze has already blown across the land. Six hundred million people have become their own masters, and this group of Yao and Shun wielding iron arms and silver hoes have finally driven away the God of Plague and are creating a happy new life. Although they are not medical experts, unity is strength, and this great power is completely different from the past when "Hua Tuo was helpless against a small worm."

    The second point concerns the hatching of schistosomiasis eggs:

    The intermediate host of schistosomiasis is the Oncomelania hupensis snail, which is not a problem. But I said that "schistosomiasis eggs can only wreak havoc after they hatch in the snail's body," which was not accurate. The facts are as follows:

    Schistosomiasis eggs hatch in the water outside the snail's body. The eggs are in a favorable environment, such as suitable water volume and temperature, which changes the osmotic pressure inside the egg, forming a miracidium, which hatches out of the shell. It is 0.1 mm long and 0.04 mm wide, and can live for twenty-four to thirty-two hours in the water. It moves vigorously, advancing in a straight line towards the clear water. When it encounters a snail, it relies on the secretions of its head gland and mechanical action to drill into the soft tissues of the snail's head, foot, and tentacles, etc., and reproduce asexually. This multiplies countless cercariae with pincers on their tails, which then re-enter the water. The cercariae burrow into the healthy skin of humans and livestock, enter the right side of the heart with the blood flow, pass through the pulmonary circulation, travel in the lungs, and then return to the left side of the heart, entering the systemic circulation and distributing throughout the body. Only the part transported to the intestinal wall, flowing into the blood of the portal vein system, reaches the veins in the liver and grows. This forms the disease. This is the same for both humans and animals. Horses have stronger resistance among livestock, while cattle have weaker resistance. There is a lot of worm egg excretion in cattle manure, but very little in horses.

    The above is a simple description of the life cycle of schistosomiasis, which I looked up in a book and is relatively reliable. Therefore, it was wrong for me to say that "schistosomiasis eggs hatch in the snail's body." The reason for this error is that I relied on my own half-baked understanding and talked casually without consulting a book. It can be seen that not studying hard can also lead to mistakes.

    These two errors of mine form a contrast: one is excessive, and the other is insufficient, which just proves the ancient saying that "excess is as bad as deficiency."

   (Saying too much and not saying enough are both mistakes.) The two errors also come from the same source, which is subjectivism.

    Therefore, I must correct them myself to avoid the spread of misinformation.

    坐地、巡天及其他
    郭沫若
    关于当前诗歌中的一些问题，我对“诗刊”编辑同志们的回答，在“人民日报”（2月13日）上蒙转载了，使我又审慎地把全文阅读了两遍。我发觉有两处不妥当的地方，须得由我自己来改正，免得以讹传讹。
    第一处是关于坐地与巡天的问题：
    毛主席“送瘟神”第一首第五、六两句：“坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河”，是说的地球的自转和公转，这点是可以肯定的。既肯定了这一点，那吗每一个活在地球上的人每天每夜都被地球带着自转公转，也就是说每一个人都在“坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河”。但我却作了进一步的穿凿的解释。我解释成为坐在地上不劳动的人，或者整夜不睡觉贪图欢乐的人，在天空中的逍遥游；还牵扯到周穆王八骏周游、唐明皇畅游月宫的故事。其实就是劳动的人也是在“日行八万里”；不必整夜不睡觉，人在晚间总可以看见星空，也就是在“遥看一千河”了。我答“诗刊”社问的解释，在逻辑上有问题，实在是失诸穿凿。
    我之所以生出这种不妥当的解释的原因，是我拘泥在一个“欢”字上，想在诗中求出“欢”字的坐实；其实这是多余的。在旧时代寄生阶级的欢乐就是建立在劳动人民的悲哀上面的。写到人民的不能聊生也就衬托出了不仅有吸血的虫，而且还有吸血的人了。
    至于坐地与巡天的主体究竟是谁，细看全诗，实际是作者自己。第一人称主语省略，在诗中本是常事。作者在慨叹了血吸虫的为害以后，想像自己坐地巡天、遥看星河的时候，常常会看到前身是农民的牛郎（牵牛星），可能被问起故乡的情况，被问起瘟神是否还在肆虐。作者在想像的对话中这样回答：在牛郎离开人间的几千年中，时间之波尽管逝去，阶级社会中悲者自悲、欢者自欢的老样子却一直继续着。但是这一切都是说过去。第一首诗的结束也结束了旧时代的景象。当作者看了“人民日报”的报导而“遥望南天”的时候，正如旭日临窗，春风也已经吹遍了大地。六亿人民自己做了主人，这一群挥动铁臂银锄的尧舜终于赶走了瘟神，创造着幸福的新生活。他们虽然不是医学专家，但是团结就是力量，这个伟大的力量比之“华陀无奈小虫何”的前尘完全不可同日而语了。
    第二处是关于血吸虫卵的孵化问题：
    血吸虫的中间宿主是钉螺，那是没有问题的。但我说“血吸虫的卵在钉螺体中孵化后才能兴妖作怪”，却没有说准确。事实是这样：
    血吸虫的卵是在钉螺体外的水中孵化的。卵处在有利的环境里面，例如水量和温度的适宜，使得卵内的渗透压改变，形成毛蚴，脱壳而孵化，长径0.1公厘，短径0.04公厘，在水中游泳，可以活到二十四到三十二小时。运动活泼，向着水清处直线前进。遇着钉螺时，靠着头腺的分泌物和机械作用，钻入钉螺的头部、足部和触角等柔软组织里面，进行无性繁殖。这样就增殖出无数尾上有钳子的幼虫（cercaria），再入水中。幼虫钻入人和牲畜的健康皮肤，随着血流进入心脏右侧，经过小循环，在肺中旅行之后，又回到心脏左侧，转入大循环而分布全身。只有被运送到肠壁的那一部分，流入门脉系的血液里面，达到肝脏内的静脉而成长。这就形成病症了。人畜都是这样。牲畜中马的抵抗性比较强，牛的抵抗性比较弱。牛粪中虫卵的排泄很多，马却很少。
    以上是血吸虫生活史的简单叙述，我是查过书来的，比较可靠。因此，我说“血吸虫的卵在钉螺体中孵化”，那是错了。这个错误发生的原因是由于凭着自己的一知半解，随便谈谈，没有查书。可见不好好读书，也是会出错误的。
    我这两个错误，形成对照：一个是过了，一个是不及，刚刚证明了古人所说的“过犹不及”。
  （说多了和没有说够，同样是错误。）两个错误也同出一源，那就是主观主义了。
    因此，须得由我自己来改正，免得以讹传讹。
                          1959年2月22日。
