    Underground Coal Gasification
    Wen Ping
    In some cities in our country, gas is used as fuel. This gas is produced by gas plants using coal through a complex process. In late February, our country's Hegang Coal Mine successfully tested a method of directly turning the coal seam buried underground into gas. In this way, there is no need for such a large and complex equipment as a gas plant, but a more economical and simple method is used to extract gas. This new technology is called: Underground Coal Gasification.
    Underground coal gasification, also known as underground coal seam gasification, In the late nineteenth century, the great Russian chemist Mendeleev had such an ideal: The coal buried underground does not need to be mined, but the coal seam can be turned into gas and then transported to remote places through pipelines. Mendeleev's genius ideal has begun to be realized in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has now established some large-scale underground gasification power plants and accumulated a lot of experience. Today, with the guidance of advanced Soviet technology, Mendeleev's theory has also become a reality in China.
    The method of underground coal gasification is to first explore the geological conditions in the underground coal seam, and then drill into the middle of the coal seam. One borehole is connected to a compressed air pipe, and the high-pressure air from the air compressor is used to enlarge the cracks in the coal seam, which is called compressed air communication channel. Then, hot charcoal or coke is put into another borehole, and a large amount of high-pressure air is given, so the coal seam is burned. Then, a lot of gas is generated, and after reaction and dry distillation, it becomes gas, which is discharged from the ignition borehole.
    In recent years, gas has also been widely used in industry, such as metal, machinery manufacturing, chemical, textile, and power stations can use gas as fuel.
    There are many advantages of using gas. Its heat is greater than other fuels: the thermal efficiency of coal is 20%-30%, and that of gas is 40%; each kilogram of coal can generate four cubic meters of gas underground. Gas can also be supplied regularly, without stopping or fluctuating, and the firepower can be adjusted freely. It is also easy to ignite and extinguish. At the same time, gas is smokeless and ashless, and does not need to be stored, so it is cleaner and more hygienic, which is also good for improving the air above the city. The gas equipment is simple, not easy to damage and durable.
    After adopting underground coal gasification, the heavy mining processes such as coal mine tunneling, coal mining, and hoisting can be eliminated, fundamentally liberating the miners from the heavy labor underground and ensuring the safety of the staff.

    煤的地下气化
    文平
    我国有些城市里，都用煤气作为燃料。这种煤气是煤气厂用煤经过复杂的过程制成的。我国鹤岗煤矿已于2月下旬试验成功把埋在地底下的煤层直接变成煤气的方法。这样一来，就不必用煤气厂那样庞大复杂的设备了，而是用更经济、简便的方法来抽出煤气。这项新技术叫做：煤炭地下气化。
    煤炭地下气化，又叫作煤层地下瓦斯化。早在十九世纪末叶，伟大的俄罗斯化学家门得列也夫就有过这样的一个理想：埋藏在地底下的煤不必开采出来，可以把煤层变成煤气然后用管道输送到遥远的地方去。门得列也夫这个天才的理想，在苏联已经开始实现了。苏联现在已经建立了一些大型的地下气化发电站，并积累了不少经验。今天有了苏联先进技术的指导，门得列也夫的学说在中国也变成了现实。
    煤炭地下气化的方法就是将地下煤层中的地质情况先探清楚，然后用钻孔打到煤层中间。一个钻孔通入压风管，使用空气压缩机的高压空气将煤层中的裂缝穿大，这叫做压风贯通通道。然后由另一个钻孔放进灼热的木炭或焦炭，给以大量的高压空气，就这样煤层被燃烧起来了。然后生成许多气体，经反应、干馏以后就成为煤气，从点火的钻孔排出来。
    近年来，煤气也被广泛利用在工业上，如金属、机械制造、化工、纺织、电站都可以使用煤气作燃料。
    使用煤气的优点是很多的，它的热量比其它燃料为大：煤的热效率为20％—30％，煤气为40％；每一公斤煤，在地下可生成四立方公尺的煤气。煤气还能够经常供应，没有停止或忽多忽少的毛病，而火力大小可以自由调节着使用，点火灭火也容易。同时，煤气无烟无灰，也用不着存放，所以比较清洁卫生，对改善城市上空的空气也有好处，煤气设备简单，不易损坏经久耐用。
    采用煤炭地下气化后，就可以省去煤矿的掘进、采煤、提升等许多繁重的开采过程，从根本上把矿工们从井下笨重的劳动中解放出来，确保工作人员的安全。
