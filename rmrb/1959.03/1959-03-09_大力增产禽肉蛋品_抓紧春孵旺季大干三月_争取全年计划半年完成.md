Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly held a national poultry production on-site meeting in Qingyuan County, Guangdong, calling on all regions to work hard for three months, fully grasp spring hatching, and strive to complete the annual poultry raising plan ahead of schedule.

More than 500 representatives from agricultural and commercial departments of various provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and some special zones and counties, as well as some people's communes and relevant departments, attended the meeting. The meeting widely exchanged advanced experiences in rapidly developing poultry and egg production, and conducted on-site visits and studies of Qingyuan County's poultry raising methods that combined collective breeding and member family breeding.

The meeting summarized the work of developing poultry production last year, believing that the national poultry industry had made considerable achievements last year, especially the active development of winter hatching in the past winter, breaking the routine, which was even more remarkable. According to incomplete statistics from 20 provinces, cities, and districts, more than 55 million chicks were hatched using artificial and mechanical methods last winter. This not only laid a good foundation for this year's spring hatching, but also opened the way for year-round hatching in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, overcoming the contradiction between the seasonality of poultry production and the perenniality of supply.

The meeting required all regions to take practical measures to achieve a greater leap forward in the production of poultry and eggs. At present, it is necessary to seize the peak season of spring hatching, work hard for three months, fully grasp spring hatching, and strive to complete two-thirds of this year's poultry raising plan in the first half of the year, and strive to complete the annual plan in half a year, so as to increase the supply of poultry meat and eggs.

The meeting believed that in developing poultry production, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of walking on two legs. On the one hand, it is necessary to vigorously develop collective poultry farming. Every people's commune, management area, production team, and canteen should actively establish poultry farms for breeding, giving full play to the superiority of collective production; on the other hand, member family poultry raising should also be promoted, especially the promotion of every household raising chickens, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the vast number of members in raising poultry. The meeting emphasized that in developing poultry and egg production, it is necessary to implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing self-sufficiency production and commodity production. The people's commune should make overall plans, comprehensive arrangements, and strive to increase production to meet needs, and at present, it should especially vigorously support the needs of urban industrial and mining areas and exports. In order to strive to launch the first shot of a greater leap forward in poultry production this year, the meeting conducted a detailed study on how to do a good job in spring hatching. The meeting believed that in carrying out the spring blitz movement, it is necessary to focus on three issues: First, find out the source of seed eggs and adopt a self-breeding and self-sufficiency policy to solve the problem locally. The eggs purchased by the commercial departments should also be supplied for hatching first, and then enter the market; second, vigorously establish hatching rooms, and achieve that every commune has a hatching room and puts it into production within three months; third, adopt methods such as on-site learning and holding training courses to train hatching technicians and enhance the technical strength of hatching work.

The meeting pointed out that the biggest threat to chicken raising at present is hatching plague, which must be treated as a key point for prevention and control. All regions should grasp hatching on the one hand and epidemic prevention on the other hand in the spring. It is necessary to seize the production of vaccines, and all hatched chicks should be vaccinated through the nose with the second-line vaccine. In March and April, all incubators should be immunized. To this end, the poultry farms of the people's communes must establish professional epidemic prevention teams and epidemic prevention systems to regularize the epidemic prevention work.

The meeting also studied the feed problem required for the development of poultry production. The meeting believed that poultry feeding should be mainly based on green feed, and there should also be a certain amount of concentrated feed. Each commune and state-run poultry farm needs to allocate a certain amount of feed land or use reclaimed sloping land to grow feed according to the poultry development plan, and also vigorously collect substitute feed and use various methods to manufacture various feeds. In the peak season of summer and autumn feed production, a blitz should be carried out for harvesting, processing, and storage for use in winter and spring. Areas with conditions should try to adopt a combination of grazing and pen feeding. The meeting also studied the improvement of the operation and management of the poultry industry and put forward suggestions.

The meeting pointed out that, according to the trend of great development in poultry production this year, commercial departments at all levels should have a full estimate of the market situation of goods and make preparations for purchasing, processing, and storage. They should actively adopt the form of ordering contracts and pay attention to improving purchasing methods to ensure how much is put on the market and how much is purchased, fully meet the producers' sales requirements, support the development of production, and complete the state's purchase plan.

    大力增产禽肉蛋品
    抓紧春孵旺季大干三月　争取全年计划半年完成
    据新华社讯　农业部、商业部最近在广东清远县联合召开了全国家禽生产现场会议，要求各地大干三个月，全力抓春孵，力争提前完成全年养禽计划。
    出席这个会议的有各省、市、自治区和部分专区、县的农业、商业部门以及部分人民公社和有关部门的代表共五百多人。会议广泛交流了迅速发展家禽和蛋品生产的先进经验，对清远县采取集体饲养和社员家庭饲养相结合的养禽办法，进行了现场参观和学习。
    会议总结了去年发展家禽生产的工作，认为去年全国养禽业取得了不少成绩，特别是在去年冬季打破常规积极开展冬孵工作，成绩更为显著。据二十个省、市、区不完全统计，去年冬季利用人工和机器孵化的雏禽就有五千五百多万只，这不仅给今年春孵打下了良好基础，还为今后春、夏、秋、冬常年进行孵化，克服家禽生产季节性和供应常年性的矛盾打开了道路。
    会议要求各地采取切实措施，使家禽、蛋品的生产来一个更大的跃进。当前，要抓紧春季孵化旺季，大干三个月，全力抓春孵，努力做到今年养禽计划在上半年完成三分之二，并力争全年计划半年完成，以便增加禽肉、禽蛋的供应。
    会议认为，在发展家禽生产上，必须认真贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针，一方面要大力发展集体养禽业，每个人民公社，管理区，生产队，食堂应积极建立禽场，进行饲养，充分发挥集体生产的优越性；另方面还应提倡社员家庭养禽，特别是应该提倡家家养鸡户户养鸡，充分发挥广大社员养禽的积极性。会议着重指出，在发展家禽、蛋品生产时，必须贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，人民公社应该作到统筹兼顾，全面安排，努力增产，满足需要，在目前尤其应该大力支援城市工矿区和出口的需要。为了力争打响今年家禽生产更大跃进的第一炮，会议对如何搞好春孵工作进行了详细的研究。会议认为，在开展春季突击化运动时，要抓紧三个问题：一是查清种蛋，采取自繁自给方针，就地解决。商业部门采购的蛋品，也应首先供应孵化需要，然后再进入市场；二是大力建立孵房，在三个月内要作到社社有孵房，并投入生产；三是采取现场学习和召开训练班等形式培养孵化技术人员，增强孵化工作的技术力量。
    会议指出，当前对养鸡危害最大是孵瘟，必须作为重点进行防治，各地要在春季一手抓孵化，一手抓防疫，要抓紧疫苗生产，孵出的雏孵要全部经过二系疫苗点鼻，在3、4月份要对所有的孵进行免疫注射。为此人民公社的养禽场必须建立防疫专业队伍和防疫制度，使防疫工作经常化。
    会议对发展家禽生产所需的饲料问题也作了研究。会议认为，喂养家禽应该以青绿饲料为主，同时要有一定数量的精饲料。每个公社和国营养禽场都需要根据家禽发展计划，划出一定的饲料地或利用退耕的坡地种植饲料，还要大力采集代用饲料，利用多种方式，制造多种饲料。在夏秋饲料生产旺季，应该突击进行割收加工贮存工作，以备冬春使用。有条件的地区应该尽量采取放牧和舍饲相结合的方式来饲养。会议对改进养禽业的经营管理，也进行了研究，并且提出了意见。
    会议指出，根据今年家禽生产大发展的趋势，各级商业部门，对货源上市情况要有充分的估计，并要做好收购、加工、储存的准备，积极采取订购合同形式及注意改进收购方法，保证上市多少，就收购多少，充分满足生产者的出售要求，支持生产的发展，完成国家收购计划。
