Making a Good Job of Agricultural Production is the Main Task at Present
Zhuji Fengqiao Commune Strengthens Spring Ploughing by Transferring Labor from All Aspects

(Our newspaper Hangzhou, 10th) With the spring plowing season approaching, the Fengqiao People's Commune in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, has adopted methods of compression, transfer, and overall adjustment to transfer a large number of laborers from industries, water conservancy construction, transportation, cultural and welfare undertakings, and other aspects to strengthen spring plowing work.

Last year's Great Leap Forward, especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, saw Fengqiao Commune set up more than 4,700 large and small factories and mines such as steel plants, chemical fertilizer plants, and refractory brick plants. Agricultural middle schools, wired broadcasting, postal and telecommunications services, and cultural and welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, laundry and sewing groups, and barber groups have also developed unprecedentedly. It was necessary to establish these undertakings, but due to insufficient experience at the time, they occupied too much labor. In the arrangement of part-time laborers in canteens, there were also inappropriate aspects, and the role of part-time laborers was not fully utilized. After the Spring Festival this year, the Commune Party Committee, in accordance with the needs of comprehensively developing production, especially ensuring the Great Leap Forward in grain, cotton, and oil production, made overall arrangements for the labor force of the entire commune. The commune has a total of 244 agricultural canteens with 1,615 staff members. Now, according to the instructions of the commune, each canteen tries its best to assign less arduous tasks such as washing vegetables, cutting vegetables, cooking dishes, and cooking rice to women and experienced old farmers. Each canteen only keeps two strong laborers to carry water, carry rice, chop firewood, and deliver food. More than 500 full-time laborers can be transferred from here. The teachers and students of the commune's agricultural middle school originally only participated in one or two hours of labor per day, but now it has been changed to a perennial people's school, and all participate in production full-time. The fully detached cultural troupe with 33 members has now been changed to a non-detached production team, and performs amateur performances when there are propaganda tasks. In the second half of last year, the commune added 20 full-time postal workers, and now it has been decided to restore the past delivery method and reduce all postal workers.

The commune has also reorganized some factories with insufficient raw materials and poor production conditions, and appropriately tightened some industrial production, thus withdrawing a total of more than 4,600 people from the industrial sector.

Last winter and this spring, 6,300 people participated in the construction of only two medium-sized reservoirs. Among them, the main purpose of building the Yongning Reservoir is to generate electricity. At present, power generation equipment cannot be fully equipped for a while, and the dam has reached the height of flood control. The Commune Party Committee decided that 3,600 laborers on the reservoir construction site, except for 200 people who will rush to excavate the diversion culvert, will all return to agricultural production. Since the second half of last year, due to the needs of industrial production, most of the pumping machines of some production teams in the commune have been concentrated in Fengqiao Town for unified use. These pumping machines were originally the power for the rice milling machines of the production teams. After being concentrated in the commune, when each production team needs to mill rice, it has to send a stronger labor force to carry the rice from the granary to Fengqiao for milling, and then carry it back. According to incomplete statistics, the entire commune spends more than 800 laborers every day carrying food rice. In order to reduce this huge labor expenditure, the commune has recently set up some rice milling stations in each management district. Some management districts also adopted the method of itinerant processing of rice milling machines under the production team. These improvements have saved 560 laborers in the entire commune every day. Other transportation work has also saved some labor force due to reasonable arrangements.

The Fengqiao People's Commune is vigorously promoting the "double participation" system of cadres participating in production and members participating in leadership. The implementation of this system not only makes the relationship between cadres and the masses closer, but also enables the main cadres of the production team to have more time to participate in production. In the two months before the implementation of the "double participation" system in the advanced production team of the Xinfeng Management District, due to many affairs, the labor time of the party branch secretary and the captain of the team combined was less than ten days. In the half month after the implementation of "double participation", except for the branch secretary who went to Zhuji County for an eight-day meeting, he participated in production every day for the rest of the time. There are 139 production teams in the entire commune, with an average of five main cadres per team. In the past, these cadres actually separated from production. After the implementation of "double participation", an average of three and a half of these five people participated in production every day. At present, the Fengqiao Commune Party Committee has decided that on the basis of the universal implementation of "double participation," the main cadres such as the branch secretary and captain of each production team should participate in production full-time.

Through the above measures, the Fengqiao People's Commune is equivalent to increasing nearly 10,000 laborers.

    搞好农业生产是当前主要任务
    诸暨枫桥公社从各方面调劳力加强备耕
    本报杭州10日电　春耕季节临近了。浙江省诸暨县枫桥人民公社采取压缩、抽调和全面调整的方法，从工业、水利建设、运输和文化福利事业等各方面抽调大批劳动力，来加强备耕工作。
    去年的大跃进，特别是成立人民公社以后，枫桥公社举办了钢铁厂、化学肥料厂、耐火砖厂等四千七百多个大小厂矿。农业中学、有线广播、邮电事业和食堂、托儿所、洗衣缝纫组、理发组等文化福利事业也空前发展。举办这些事业是必要的，但由于当时经验不足，占用劳力多了一些。在食堂工作人员中，整半劳动力的安排也有不够恰当的地方，没有充分发挥半劳动力的作用。今年春节以后，公社党委根据全面发展生产，特别是保证粮、棉、油生产大跃进的需要，通盘安排了全社的劳动力。这个公社共有二百四十四个农业食堂，工作人员共一千六百一十五人，现在，各个食堂根据公社的指示，把洗菜、切菜、烧菜、烧饭等不太繁重的工作尽量让妇女和有炊事经验的老农担任，各食堂只留两个青壮劳动力来挑水、挑米、劈柴、挑饭，从这里可以抽调出五百多个整劳动力。公社农业中学的师生，原来每天只参加一二个钟头的劳动，现在改成了常年民校，一律全日参加生产。全部脱产的文工团有三十三人，目前已改为不脱产的生产队，有宣传任务时进行业余演出。去年下半年全社增加了二十名专职邮递员，现在决定恢复过去的传递办法，把邮递员全部减掉。
    公社还整顿了一些原料不足和生产情况不好的工厂，以及适当紧缩一部分工业生产，这样从工业方面共抽回四千六百多人。
    去冬今春，仅只参加修筑两个中型水库的就有六千三百人。其中永宁水库，修建的主要目的是发电，目前发电器材一时不能备齐，水坝又达到了拦洪的高度，公社党委决定，这个水库工地上的三千六百个劳动力，除留二百人赶凿导流涵洞以外，全部回到农业生产。去年下半年以来，由于工业生产的需要，公社一些生产队的抽水机大部分集中到枫桥镇上统一使用。这些抽水机原来是生产队碾米机的动力，集中到公社以后，各生产队需要碾米时，要派出较强的劳动力从粮仓里把稻谷挑到枫桥去碾，然后再挑回去。据不完全统计，全公社每天花在挑运食米上的劳动力有八百多人。为了减少这项巨大的劳力支出，公社最近在各管理区分设了一些碾米站。有的管理区还采取碾米机下生产队巡回加工的办法。这些改进使全公社每天节省了五百六十个劳动力。其他的运输工作由于合理安排，也节省了一部分劳动力。
    枫桥人民公社正在大力推行干部参加生产和社员参加领导的“双参”制度。实行这个制度，不仅使干部和群众的关系更加密切，而且使生产队的主要干部有更多的时间参加生产。新枫管理区先进生产队在实行“双参”制度以前的两个月中，由于事务多，这个队的党支部书记和队长两个人的劳动时间加起来还不到十天。实行“双参”以后的半个月，除了支部书记到诸暨县里开了八天会以外，其余时间天天都参加生产。全公社一百三十九个生产队，平均每队有五个主要干部，过去这些干部实际上脱离了生产。实行“双参”以后，这五个人中平均每天有三个半人参加生产。目前，枫桥公社党委已经决定，在普遍实行“双参”的基础上，各个生产队的支部书记和队长等主要干部，都要全日参加生产。
    经过以上措施，枫桥人民公社等于增加了近万个劳动力。
