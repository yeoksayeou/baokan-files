They are Ahead of Schedule
--Recording the Achievements of the Tool Innovation in the Nanyue People's Commune
By our reporter Zhou Rong

Scene in the Fields

March. Spring plowing in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, has entered a busy stage. A few days ago, I visited the Nanyue People's Commune, located at the foot of Mount Heng, one of China's Five Great Mountains.

Entering the commune's area, which stretches for dozens of miles, is like being in a battlefield with ten thousand horses galloping. The spring plowing activities of accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, fermenting fertilizer, cultivating spring harvest crops, and meticulously plowing and harrowing are in full swing. Many of the tools used by the commune members in their labor are new tools that have been improved or newly made. Thousands of flatbed carts, "earth trains," and wheelbarrows are transporting fertilizer to the spring harvest crop fields. Young commune member Hu Wenxuan pushed 800 jin of fertilizer; a string of young people behind him pushed about the same amount.

Walking past the field ridges, many commune members were raising the banks of the fertilizer ponds and turning the ponds. I saw that they were using a new type of wooden "ditch digging and pond turning device." One person pulled the rope in front, and one person operated it in the back. The commune members said that this improved work efficiency by two times compared to the original method. Sure enough, before I had been standing at the side of the field for five minutes, they had finished one pond.

In the paddy fields, a new type of fertilizer transporting tool called "slurry boat" was also widely promoted. Commune member Li Chunhan loaded three dan of fertilizer into the slurry boat, and with a strong push, the slurry boat shot out like an arrow, sliding from the edge of the field to the middle of the field with a "whoosh" sound. In the 20-zhang long paddy field, it only took two pushes from one end to the other. The commune members called it the "water shuttle."

Walking straight from the field ridges towards the hillside, I saw more than a hundred people accumulating fertilizer on the mountain, but no one transporting fertilizer down the mountain. Looking more closely, there was an aerial cableway for transporting fertilizer, from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, as well as two earth-wood mixed material sliding troughs, the troughs were about ten feet wide, the trough trenches were two feet deep, and the bottom of the trough was smooth wooden planks. Just as I was watching, dozens of dan of fertilizer on the top of the mountain flowed down the troughs to the fields at the foot of the mountain in an instant. The commune members excitedly told me that with the "cable" and "trough," no one needed to transport fertilizer anymore, and one trough could transport fertilizer faster and in greater quantities than a hundred people carrying it down the mountain.

On the two narrow and winding mountain roads, as well as from the edge of the field to the center of the field, bridges were built with stools and wood to provide direct access. The commune members called these "sky bridges." With them, people walked a lot less distance. The Jiuguan Bridge team built a sky bridge on a winding mountain road, which originally required a detour of four li, but now only required one li. A group of commune members carrying heavy loads, walking on the sky bridge with smiling faces, all said that it was indeed a "sky bridge."

I stood on the high mountain and looked down at the fields, and I personally saw how much the hardworking people had achieved in the spring plowing: in the 60,000 mu of paddy fields, fertilizer ponds were scattered everywhere, with 50 to 70 star-shaped ponds per mu, a total of 600 dan of high-quality nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium mixed fertilizer was fermented; the 9,000 mu of spring-harvested rapeseed and wheat grew thick, dense, and tall, and the rapeseed fields were full of yellow flowers, the fragrance of the flowers could be smelled for ten li. The comrades of the commune Party committee once told me: "We have won labor force entirely by mass-based tool innovation." At this moment, I have a more profound understanding of this sentence.

This commune launched a tool innovation movement in the spring plowing, promoting 8,000 carts, 493 mountain fertilizer sliding troughs, 10,000 sky bridges, more than 1,000 slurry boats, 782 ditch digging tools, and 53 aerial cableways. It was these tools that helped the 11,000 laborers in the commune do the work of 35,000 to 40,000 laborers every day, increasing work efficiency by an average of more than two times. It was originally estimated that from the beginning of February to the end of April, the spring harvest and spring sowing would lack 1.1 million laborers; after improving work efficiency through the tool innovation movement, 200,000 more labor days of farm work have now been completed ahead of schedule.

Innovating Tools According to Local Conditions

To ask why the tool reform in this commune has such a great effect, we must mention the commune's Party committee. It was a spring night in late January, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, Liu Wengui, was sitting in his office, concentrating on thinking about and analyzing the situation and problems he had discovered in the past few days while inspecting the preparatory work for spring plowing. He was happy at one moment, and frowning at another. What was the reason for this?

It turned out that during the inspection, he saw that the commune members were working hard according to the "Eight-Character Charter" and the measures and requirements to ensure a yield of 3,000 jin per mu of rice. This was the reason for his happiness. But when he thought of the fact that the masses were doing more hard work and less skillful work, and based on the progress of production, he calculated that from the beginning of February to the end of April when the rice seedlings were transplanted, a total of 2.2 million laborers would be needed for the spring harvest and spring sowing of more than 60,000 mu of fields, and the 11,000 laborers in the entire commune could only provide 1.1 million labor days, a difference of half. Therefore, he frowned again.

His frowning was not a sign of shrinking back, but a deep contemplation of ways to solve the shortage of labor. After thinking it over, the main way was to effectively promote tool innovation across the board.

The next day, Liu Wengui, Liu Zuoming, and Liu Weifeng, the three secretaries of the commune Party committee, came to the Shigubiao Brigade and invited the brigade's general branch secretary, the brigade leader, carpenters, and more than ten commune members. While walking from the field ridges to the hillside, and from the hillside to the field ridges, they observed the terrain characteristics and came up with ways to innovate tools according to the characteristics of this team. That afternoon, the secretaries and commune members built a one-li long wooden train and wooden rails. The carpenters rushed to make an earth train carriage overnight. The third day, they began to push fertilizer. An average laborer pushed 18 dan at a time, while the same laborer could only carry 120 jin. The onlookers applauded and praised. Next, they used bamboo to make a light and flexible wheelbarrow that could push 300 to 500 jin, suitable for walking on the field ridges. They also created a fertilizer sliding trough on the mountain that increased work efficiency a hundredfold. An aerial cableway was built on the mountain tops with abundant fertilizer, and direct wooden bridges were built on winding roads, mountain gullies, and between two ridges. A "ditch digging and pond turning tool" was also created for digging ditches and turning ponds, and slurry boats were promoted for transporting fertilizer in paddy fields. In a few days, all the tools that could be innovated in the Shigubiao team were innovated and put into use, and the work efficiency was significantly improved. The commune Party committee immediately held an on-site meeting here, and more than 100 Party branch secretaries, team leaders, commune members, and local technicians from 15 brigades visited and performed on the spot. The same types of tools were compared and finalized on the spot. After the team leaders, branch secretaries, and representatives returned, the tool reform movement quickly unfolded.

Each team innovated tools according to local conditions. The mountain teams focused on digging more mountain sliding troughs, building aerial cableways, and building sky bridges; the plain teams focused on promoting earth trains and wheelbarrows; and slurry boats for transporting fertilizer in paddy fields and ditch digging tools were widely promoted. The commune's three agricultural machinery factories and sixteen brigade repair stations rushed to produce them day and night according to the finalized styles. In this way, tool innovation was fast and good, and each item produced was used.

The more than one million laborers lacking in the spring plowing of the entire commune were solved by relying on mass-based tool innovation.

A Bigger Upsurge is Ahead

The mass-based and effective tool innovation movement not only solved the problem of labor shortage in the spring plowing, but also prepared for the next step of tool innovation in field management. When I visited Comrade Liu Wengui, the secretary of the commune Party committee, he particularly emphasized this point.

He told me that when carrying out mass-based tool innovation, tool innovation offices headed by the secretaries were established from the commune Party committee to the Party branches of the production teams, and they planned to persist in tool innovation to the end. At the same time, they consciously trained more than 110 local technicians who dared to think, dared to do, and knew how to use tools. Through this movement, more than 9,000 laborers in the entire commune have become skilled at pushing carts, and they have also repaired 30 li of roads and large cart roads, and more than 1,000 field cart roads, which are all preparations for the next stage of tool innovation.

Based on this, the commune initially plans to innovate five to seven more universal tools in the next stage of production, which can save about one million laborers. The 110 local technicians, under the personal guidance and assistance of the Party branch secretaries of the major brigades, are actively designing and trial-producing various models. Li Huanmin, a local technician from the Jiuguan Brigade, and Zhao Shaofeng, the general Party branch secretary, are studying and trial-producing new insecticide sprayers, rapid weeding and cultivating machines, and seeding machines for both paddy fields and dry land. Yang Xinsheng, the director of the commune's technological innovation office, is also modifying a new light rice transplanter. A greater upsurge of tool innovation is taking shape.

    他们走在计划的前面
    ——记南岳人民公社工具革新的成效
    本报记者　周荣
    田间即景
    3月，湖南省衡山县春耕已进入了繁忙的阶段。前几天我访问了这个在我国五岳之一的衡山脚下的南岳人民公社。
    进入公社纵横数十里的地区，宛如置身在一个万马奔腾的战场。积肥、运肥、沤肥、培育春收作物、精犁细耙的春耕活动，搞得热火朝天。社员们在劳动中使用的很多是经过改良或新制的新工具，正向春收作物田里送肥的是数以千计的板车、土火车、鸡公车。青年社员胡文宣，推了八百斤肥；后面一串青年人，推的比他不相上下。
    步过田垅，很多社员正在加高氹沿、翻氹。看到他们使用的都是一种新式的木制“打沟翻氹器”。一人在前拉索，一人在后操作。社员们说，这比原来要提高工效两倍。果真，我在田边停留还没有五分钟，他们就搞好了一个氹。
    在水田里，这里也普遍推广了一种运肥的新式工具，叫做“污船”。社员李春汉把三担肥装入污船里，用力一推，污船像脱弓的箭，“哗”的一声从田边滑到了田中。在二十丈长的水田中，从这头到那头，只需推两下就到了。社员叫这为“水上梭”。
    从田垅直朝山坡走去，见山上有一百多人在积肥，却不见人运肥下山。仔细往前边一看，空中架有一条运肥索道，从山头到山脚，还有两条土木混制的滑溜槽，槽有丈把宽，槽圳两尺深，槽底是光滑的木板。正注视中，山头上几十担肥，一下就从槽子里流到了山脚边的田里。社员们兴奋地告诉我，有了“索”和“槽”，肥料再多也不用人运了；一百个人从山上往下挑，还顶不上一个槽运肥的那么快、那样多。
    在那两个山坡狭窄、弯曲的山道，以及从田边到田中心等地方，都用凳子、木头架起了桥，可以直达，社员们称此为“天桥”。有了它，使人少走了很多的路。九关桥队在一条弯曲的山道上架起了天桥，原来绕道四里，现在只需走一里。一群挑着重担的社员，走在天桥上笑逐颜开，都说这确是“天桥”。
    我站在高山上俯视田垅，亲眼看到了巧干苦干的人们，他们在春耕中做出了多么大的成绩：六万亩水田里，肥氹星罗棋布，每亩打上了星子氹五至七十个，共沤上了氮磷钾优质混肥六百担；九千亩春收的油菜和麦子，长得又浓又密又高，油菜田里开满黄花，真是花香十里。社党委会的同志曾经告诉我：“全凭群众性的工具革新赢得了劳力。”此刻，我对这句话更有深刻的体会。
    这个公社在春耕中展开了工具革新运动，共推广了车子八千部，山头运肥流槽四百九十三条，天桥一万处，污船千多个，打沟器七百八十二个，空中索道五十三条。就是这些工具，帮助公社出勤的一万一千个劳力，每天做了三万五千到四万个劳力的事，平均提高工效两倍多。原来计算从2月初到4月底止，春收春播共缺劳力一百一十万个；通过工具革新运动提高工效后，现在已经提前多做了二十万个劳动日的农活了。
    因地制宜革新工具
    要问这个公社工具改革为什么有这么大的效果呢？还得提到公社的党委会。那是元月下旬的一个春夜，公社党委第一书记刘文贵，坐在办公室，专心在思考和分析自己几天来在检查备耕工作中发现的情况和问题。他一时高兴，一时又锁着双眉。这到底为什么呢？
    原来，他在检查中看到，社员们正根据“八字”宪法和保证稻谷亩产三千斤指标的措施和要求，拼命苦干。这是他高兴的原因。但想起群众在生产中苦干的多，巧干的少，根据生产进度，屈指一算，从2月初到4月底插完秧为止，六万多亩田的春收春播共需工二百二十万个，全公社一万一千个劳力只能出勤一百一十万个劳动日，足足相差一半。于是，他又锁起了双眉。
    他锁眉，并不是表示畏缩，而是在深思熟虑地谋划解决劳力奇缺的办法。想来想去，主要的办法还是有成效地把工具革新普遍搞起来。
    第二天，刘文贵、刘作明、刘威风三个公社党委书记，来到了师古桥大队，邀请了大队的总支书记、大队长、木工、社员十多个人，一边从田垅走向山坡，又从山坡走向田垅，一边察看地形特点，一边根据这个队的特点想出了工具革新的办法。当天下午，书记们和社员们就架起一华里长的木火车木轨，木匠连夜赶制了一个土火车箱，第三天开始推肥，一个中等劳力一次推了十八担，而同等劳力只能挑一百二十斤。旁观的社员，个个拍手称好。接着，用竹子做成一种轻巧灵活、能推三五百斤重、适于走田垅的鸡公车，又在山上创制了提高工效百倍的运肥流槽，肥多的山头上架起了空中索道，弯路、山沟、两坎之间架起了直达的木桥，打沟氹翻氹也创制了“打氹翻氹器”，水田还推行了污船运肥。几天中，师古桥队能革新的工具都革新了，全部使用了起来，工效显著提高了。公社党委立即在这里召开了现场会，十五个大队的党支书、队长、社员、土技术员一百多人都参观，当场进行了表演，同样的几种工具作了比较，当场定型。队长、支书和代表们回去后，工具改革运动就迅速开展起来了。
    各队都因地制宜地革新工具，山区的队着重多挖山头溜槽，架空中索道，架天桥；平地着重推行了土火车、鸡公车；水田运肥污船和打沟翻氹器，普遍推广。公社三个农械厂和十六个大队的修配站，根据定型的式样，日夜赶制。这样，工具革新又快又好，制出一件就使用了一件。
    全公社春耕中缺少的一百多万个劳力，就是这样依靠群众性的工具革新解决了。
    更大高潮在前边
    群众性的有成效的工具革新运动，不仅解决了春耕中的劳力不足问题，而且为下一步田间管理革新工具作好了准备。我访问公社党委书记刘文贵同志时，他特别强调了这一点。
    他告诉我，在大搞群众工具革新时，从社党委到生产队的党支部，都成立了以书记为首的工具革新办公室，打算把工具革新坚持到底。同时，又有意识的培养了敢想敢做会使用工具的一百一十多个土技术员。通过这次运动，全公社已有九千多个劳力成了推车能手，还修了公路和大车路三十华里，田间车道一千多条，这都是为下一段革新工具作了准备。
    在这个基础上，公社初步计划在下一段生产中，再革新具有普遍性的工具五到七件，能节省劳力一百万个左右。一百一十个土技术员，在各大队党支书的亲自指导和帮助下，正积极设计和试制各种模型。九关大队土技术员李唤民和党总支书赵少峰，正在研究试制新式杀虫喷雾器、快速锄草中耕器、水田旱土两用播种器，公社技术革新办公室主任杨新生也正在改制一种新式轻巧的插秧机。一个更大的工具革新高潮正在形成中。
