    Shanghai Accelerates Acid and Alkali Production
    Light Industry and Textile Departments Strive for Self-Sufficiency in Chemical Raw Materials

    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai's chemical industry departments recently decided to further accelerate the production of approximately thirty kinds of chemical raw materials, including sulfuric acid, nitric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, oxygen, and calcium carbide. On average, the output of these products will increase from double to dozens of times compared to last year.

    In order to seize the time and rapidly increase production, Shanghai's chemical plants, starting this year, are further mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovations based on last year's achievements, focusing on simplifying technological processes, shortening reaction times, improving equipment capacity, and comprehensively utilizing raw materials. In the first two months of this year, the city's output of basic chemical raw materials has increased by one and a half times compared to the same period last year. The Tianyuan Chemical Plant's highest daily output of caustic soda in December last year was 88 tons; it exceeded 90 tons in late January and has recently jumped to over 93 tons. The China Gas Refining Plant's calcium carbide output in January was more than the entire output of last year, and in February it increased by another 40%. The Shanghai Sulfuric Acid Plant, the largest sulfuric acid plant in Shanghai, which was built and put into production at the end of last year, saw an average daily sulfuric acid output in February increase by about 40% compared to January. The newly built chlortetracycline workshop of the Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory also more than doubled its production of chlortetracycline crude drug.

    The scale of capital construction in basic chemical industries in Shanghai this year is unprecedented. Investment in construction within the chemical system is almost entirely used to develop the chemical raw material industry, with more than ten major construction projects underway. These newly built factories are currently seizing the time and accelerating the pace of construction. The first streptomycin raw material workshop in Shanghai, which began construction last year, is progressing day and night with factory building construction and machine installation. After its completion by the end of the second quarter, it will be able to produce raw materials for 30 million bottles of streptomycin within this year. In addition, a number of construction projects including a soda ash plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons, a calcium carbide plant with an annual output of 20,000 tons, a caustic soda workshop with an annual output of 15,000 tons, and a nitric acid workshop with an annual output of 5,000 tons, will also begin construction successively.

    Mass technical innovations and large-scale capital construction will transform Shanghai's chemical industry, with its congenital deficiencies and incomplete chemical raw material industry, into a strong and complete industrial sector. The quantity of existing products such as sulfuric acid and caustic soda will increase many times over, and soda ash, nitric acid, calcium carbide, antibiotics, and various plastic raw materials, which were not produced or produced in very small quantities, will also leap forward this year and keep pace with the old products.

    (Our Dispatch) "It's better to take action than to sit and wait; grasping raw materials is the key to large-scale production." This is the slogan recently put forward by many light industrial factories and textile factories in Shanghai as they vigorously engage in the production of chemical raw materials.

    Shanghai's light and textile industries consume tens of thousands of tons of chemical raw materials every year, with a wide variety of products. In order to strive for a greater increase in the production of daily necessities this year, from the end of last year to the present, hundreds of sets of indigenous and foreign equipment for manufacturing chemical raw materials, large and small, have been added across various industries. The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory is actively installing a set of equipment with a daily output of more than three tons of soda ash. Under the leadership of the factory director, this factory has established a chemical engineering team including technicians, marketing personnel and workers, and is preparing to build a chemical workshop to produce various basic chemical raw materials. The No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 Printing and Dyeing Factories are also actively using a combination of indigenous and foreign equipment to produce chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid, liquid chlorine, and hydrogen peroxide. In order to increase the production of more toothpaste, soap, and cosmetics, Shanghai Oil and Fat Chemical Industry is building a workshop with a daily output of four tons of sulfuric acid, a workshop with an annual output of one thousand tons of soda ash is nearing completion, and an acetic acid workshop has already been put into production.

    Manufacturing chemical raw materials by themselves has already produced significant results in many light industrial and textile industries. The Hongguang Tannery now produces more than four tons of sulfuric acid every day, meeting the needs of leather production. The Nanhui Mercerizing and Bleaching Factory utilizes existing equipment and can now produce 500 kilograms of 100% caustic soda every day, ensuring normal production. (Attached Picture)

    上海加速酸碱生产
    轻工、纺织部门力求化工原料自给
    本报讯　上海化学工业部门最近确定进一步加速硫酸、硝酸、烧碱、纯碱、氧气、电石等三十种左右化工原料的生产，这些产品，平均将比去年分别增长一倍到几十倍。
    为了争取时间，迅速增产，上海的化工厂今年一开始就在去年的基础上进一步从简化工艺流程、缩短反应时间、提高设备能力、综合利用原料等方面，发动群众开展技术革命。全市基本化工原料的产量，这两个月比去年同期增长一倍半。天原化工厂的烧碱去年12月份最高日产量是八十八吨，1月下旬突破九十吨，最近几天又跃进到九十三吨以上。中国炼气厂1月份的电石产量比去年全年产量还多，2月份又增加40％。去年年底建成投入生产的上海最大的上海硫酸厂，2月份硫酸平均日产量比1月份提高40％左右。科发药厂新建的合霉素车间生产的合霉素原药也提高一倍以上。
    上海今年基本化学工业方面的基本建设规模空前发展。化工系统的建设投资，几乎全部用来发展化学原料工业，主要建设项目有十多个。这些新建的工厂，目前正在抓紧时间，加速建设进度。去年开始建造的上海第一个链霉素原料车间，目前厂房建筑、机器安装日夜并进，第二季度末完工以后，今年年内就可以生产三千万瓶链霉素的原料。此外，还有一批建设项目包括年产四万吨的纯碱厂、年产二万吨的电石厂、年产一万五千吨的烧碱车间和年产五千吨的硝酸车间，也将陆续动工。
    群众性的技术革命和大规模的基本建设，将使上海化学工业中这个先天不足，残缺不全的化学原料工业，成为一个实力雄厚、体系完整的工业部门。硫酸、烧碱等原有产品数量成倍增长，原来不生产或产量很小的纯碱、硝酸、电石、抗菌素和各种塑料原料，今年也都将一跃而和老产品并驾齐驱。
    本报讯　“坐着等不如动手干，抓原料才能大生产”这是上海许多轻工业工厂、纺织工厂最近在大搞化工原料生产中，提出的行动口号。
    上海轻纺工业耗用的化工原料每年有几万吨，而且品种很多。为了争取今年日用品更大的增产，从去年年底到目前为止，各行各业大大小小的制造化工原料的土洋设备已经增加了好几百套。国营上海第二印染厂正在积极进行一套日产三吨多纯碱设备的安装工作。这个厂在厂长的领导下成立了一个包括技术人员、供销人员和工人在内的化工小组，正在筹建一个化工车间，生产各种基本化工原料。第一、第三、第五印染厂也在积极用土洋结合的设备，生产硫酸、液氯、双氧水等化工原料。上海油脂化学工业为了增产更多的牙膏、肥皂和化妆品，一个日产四吨硫酸的车间正在建造中，年产一千吨纯碱的车间已经接近完成，冰醋酸车间已经投入生产。
    自己制造化工原料，在许多轻工业厂、纺织工业中已经产生显著的作用。红光制革厂现在每天日产四吨多硫酸，满足了皮革生产的需要；南汇丝光漂染厂利用原有设备，现在每天可以生产100％的烧碱五百公斤，保证了生产正常进行。（附图片）
