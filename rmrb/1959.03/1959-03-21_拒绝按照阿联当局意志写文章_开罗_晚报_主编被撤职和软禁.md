    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 19th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Nida" reported today that the reason why Khaled Mohieddin, editor-in-chief of the Cairo "Evening News," was recently dismissed and placed under house arrest was because he refused to write articles about the Shawwaf rebellion conspiracy according to the will of the Egyptian Special Bureau.
    Mohieddin is the chairman of the Egyptian Region Committee for Stopping Nuclear Tests and the chairman of the UAR Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee. He participated in the peace movement and attended the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament and the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation. He was dismissed on March 11.
