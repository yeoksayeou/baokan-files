Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd - According to TASS: In its reply to the U.S. note of February 16th, the Soviet government pointed out that now, more than ever, it is necessary to take urgent and effective measures to prevent the dangerous development of the situation. Therefore, the Soviet government once again suggests convening a summit meeting of national leaders to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. The Soviet government also pointed out that if Western countries are not yet prepared to participate in a summit meeting, then a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia could be held.

The Soviet government's note was delivered to U.S. Ambassador Thompson on the 2nd by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. On the same day, British Ambassador Reilly and French Ambassador Dejean also received corresponding notes.

The note stated that the U.S. government's note did not respond to the Soviet government's specific proposals, such as concluding a German peace treaty and, for this purpose, convening a peace conference of the countries that participated in the war against Germany, and normalizing the situation in Berlin.

The note stated that the Soviet government's starting point is that the heads of government should discuss their proposals regarding the conclusion of a German peace treaty and proposals on taking joint measures to eliminate the abnormal situation caused by the foreign occupation of West Berlin.

In its note, the Soviet government emphasized that it is still possible for the four major powers to re-establish cooperation on important issues related to Germany. Concluding a German peace treaty could open up this possibility. According to the treaty, both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should undertake the same obligations to eliminate the possibility of the revival of German militarism, in order to create conditions for the peaceful development of the two Germanys and to free the people of all countries from the painful threat of war.

Regarding the issue of German reunification, the Soviet government reiterated in its note that it believes that there should be no interference and no allowance for interference in the internal affairs of the two Germanys. No one can or should secretly replace them in resolving the issue of German reunification. This issue can and should be resolved by the Germans themselves.

The note pointed out that the major powers can participate with all their influence and prestige in guaranteeing the autonomous international guarantee of a demilitarized free city of Berlin.

The Soviet government expressed its willingness to discuss guarantee issues with other relevant countries, thereby seeking mutually acceptable agreements.

Referring to the U.S. government's note stating that it intends to take "all appropriate means" to maintain the occupation of West Berlin, the note pointed out that those who are threatened with the use of "all means" possess all the necessary conditions to carry out appropriate self-defense and repel any aggression. The note said that if the threats spread by the West do indeed conceal an attempt to use force, then whoever dares to do so should bear the grave responsibility to mankind for launching a new war.

The Soviet government believes that, in addition to the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, other relevant countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, which are Germany's neighbors and were among the first victims of Hitler's aggression, should also participate in the summit conference. The Soviet government also believes that the summit conference should be attended by representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany when studying the issues of the German peace treaty and West Berlin.

The Soviet government believes that it is possible to convene a meeting of heads of government in Vienna or Geneva in April of this year.

The Soviet government's note also pointed out other issues that had been previously proposed for discussion at the summit conference.

In its note, the Soviet government said that if the U.S. government is not prepared to convene a meeting of heads of government, then the Soviet government suggests convening a meeting of foreign ministers at the aforementioned time and place.

The Soviet government declared that it agrees with the suggestion of the United States, Britain, and France that representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany participate in the foreign ministers' meeting. The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to stipulate that the duration of the work of the Foreign Ministers' Conference should not exceed two or three months.

    苏联复照美英法三国再次提出建议
    召开首脑会议讨论德国问题
    如果西方国家还不准备参加首脑会议，可召开外长会议
    认为会议应有波捷等国和两个德国的代表参加
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在对美国2月16日的照会的复照中指出，现在比任何时候都需要采取紧急有效的措施，以防止事态的危险发展。因此，苏联政府再一次建议召开国家领导人最高级会议来讨论对德和约和西柏林问题。苏联政府同时指出，如果西方国家还不准备参加最高级会议，那么可以召开苏联、美国、英国、法国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克等国的外长会议。
    苏联政府的照会是在2日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给美国大使汤普逊的。同一天，英国大使赖利和法国大使德让也分别接到了相应的照会。
    照会说，美国政府的照会没有对苏联政府的这样一些具体建议作出回答：如缔结对德和约，并为此目的而召开参加对德战争的国家的和会，使柏林局势正常化等。
    照会说，苏联政府的出发点是，政府首脑应讨论他们提出的关于缔结对德和约的建议以及关于采取共同措施以消除由于外国占领西柏林而造成的不正常局面的建议。
    苏联政府在照会中着重指出，现在还有可能由四大国在同德国有关的重要问题上重新实行合作。缔结对德和约就能开辟这种可能。根据和约，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国应承担同样的义务来消除德国军国主义复活的可能性，以便为两个德国的和平发展创造条件，使各国人民摆脱痛苦的战争威胁。
    关于德国统一问题，苏联政府在照会中再一次声明，它认为，不能干涉和不允许干涉两个德国的内政，在解决德国统一的问题时任何人都不能和不准暗中顶替它们。这个问题可以，而且应该由德国人自己解决。
    照会中指出，各大国可以以它们的全部影响和威信参加保障非军事化自由城市柏林的自主的国际保证。
    苏联政府表示愿意同其它有关国家一道讨论保证问题，从而求得相互都能接受的协议。
    在谈到美国政府照会中所说的、它打算采取“一切相应的手段”来保持对西柏林的占领时指出，受到采取“一切手段”这种威胁的那些方面，拥有一切必要的条件来进行应有的自卫和击退任何侵略。照会中说，如果，在西方散布的威胁后面的确隐藏着使用武力的企图，那么谁敢这样做，谁就应该对人类负发动新战争的严重责任。
    照会说，苏联政府认为，在召开最高级会议时，除了苏、美、英、法四国以外，像波兰、捷克斯洛伐克这样一些有关国家也应当参加会议，这些国家是德国的邻国而且曾经是希特勒侵略的首批牺牲者。苏联政府还认为，最高级会议在研究对德和约问题和西柏林问题时应当有德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加。
    苏联政府认为，于今年4月在维也纳或日内瓦召开政府首脑会议是可能的。
    苏联政府的照会也指出了以前已经提出的可以在最高级会议上讨论的其它问题。
    苏联政府在照会中说，如果美国政府不准备召开政府首脑会议，那么苏联政府建议在上述期间和上述地点召开外长会议。
    苏联政府声明，它同意美国、英国和法国关于德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加外长会议的建议。苏联政府认为，规定外交部长会议工作的期限不超过两三个月是适当的。
