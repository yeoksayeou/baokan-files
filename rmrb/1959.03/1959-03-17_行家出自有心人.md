Title: An Expert Comes From a Person with a Mind

Having read the article "Work is Only Feared by Experts" in the People's Daily on the 3rd of this month, I think it's very good, but I want to add one sentence: An expert comes from a person with a mind.

To be a real expert beneficial to the people, one must have revolutionary will, enthusiasm, and perseverance, and at the same time, one must have the spirit of diligent study; that is, to be a person with a mind. This mind is a combination of loyalty to the Party, enthusiasm for socialist construction, and painstaking research into specific work. It cannot be "with ulterior motives" or "half-hearted." If you want to be an expert and make a career, if you are not loyal and use a strong will to overcome difficulties and obstacles, if you do not work hard and carefully study to master the laws of things and create various conditions, you will feel "willing in spirit but unable in strength"; conversely, you can achieve "a firm heart that cannot be penetrated." Many of the indigenous experts who emerged during the Great Leap Forward belonged to the latter type of person with a mind. Because they had unlimited loyalty, enthusiasm, and painstaking effort, they brought their subjective initiative into full play, transforming themselves from "laymen" to "insiders," and then becoming "experts."

Let me tell you about something that happened right in front of me. Yang Wen, a plumber at the Peace Machinery Factory in Qiqihar City, designed and manufactured a coal-carrying shovel car himself, which is an example of a person with a mind that should be promoted. He is a plumber with a low level of education and does not even understand the principles of automobiles. When he started designing, some people said he was "just messing around," but the cold water did not extinguish his burning heart. He stubbornly went to the automobile transportation team and the automobile repair shop to visit and study. If a car was parked on the road, he would stand and observe it carefully. Once the design was solved, he used a diesel engine as power and led the comrades in the group to pick up scrap parts from the scrap pile. Once the raw materials were solved, he began to manufacture. In order to get help from others, he would rather wipe the lathes, sweep the floor, and do chores for the master craftsmen. In two or three months, a beautiful and practical coal-carrying shovel car was finally successfully trial-produced. Because the shovel car was made by himself, he figured out the laws and performance of the shovel car. When the shovel car was made, he also became a skilled driver of the shovel car, not only becoming an "expert" in making shovel cars, but also an "expert" in driving.

The hard work and deep effort of this worker are truly admirable. But why can he have such painstaking effort? It's very simple: he, as a plumber, saw with his own eyes that the factory had difficulty transporting coal manually. Although the coal transportation workers worked hard day and night, some people even injured their feet due to being too busy, they still could not supply enough coal. As a result, the boilers were not full, the steam supply was insufficient, the workshop temperature was not enough, and the steam hammers could not be started, which affected production. Although he himself was not a coal transportation worker, his loyalty to the cause of socialist construction made him unable to sit idly by. He believed that coal transportation was a part of his career, so he was determined to use hard work to solve this problem. The problem was thus solved. The painstaking effort in researching specific work must be based on unlimited loyalty. We must learn from such people with a mind, and we hope that all people with a mind in the world will eventually become experts, becoming various "experts" needed by the Party's cause.

    行家出自有心人
    齐凡
    看了本月3日人民日报一篇“工作只怕行家做”的文章，觉得很好，但是我还要加一句：行家出自有心人。
    做个真正有益于人民的行家，必须要有革命的意志，热情和毅力，同时要有刻苦钻研的精神；那就是要做个有心人。这个心是对党的忠心、对社会主义建设的热心，和对具体工作钻研的苦心相结合的心，既不能“别有用心”，也不能“三心二意”。想作一个行家，作一番事业，如果不是忠心耿耿，以坚强的意志去克服困难和阻碍，如果不苦下功夫、精心研究去掌握事物的规律，创造各种条件，那就会感到“心有余而力不足”；反之，就能做到“心坚不可穿”。在大跃进中踊现出来的很多土专家都是属于后一种有心人。因为他们有无限忠心热心和苦心，才发挥了高度的主观能动性，才把自己由“外行”变为“内行”，进而成为“行家”的。
    就拿我跟前的一件事说说吧。齐齐哈尔市和平机器厂的一位水暖工人杨文，自己设计、制造了一台运煤铲车，是一个应该推崇为有心人的范例的。他是水暖工人，文化水平很低，连汽车原理都不懂。他开始设计时，有人说，他“在闹着玩儿”，可是凉水并没有把这颗赤热的心浇灭，他顽强地到汽车运输队、汽车修配厂去参观、学习，马路上停了一辆汽车，他也要站着仔细观察一番。设计解决了，他就利用柴油机作动力，领着组内同志到废铁堆里拣废件做配件。原料解决了，就开始制造，为了得到别人的帮助，他宁肯为老师傅们擦床子、扫地、打杂。在二、三个月的时间内一台漂亮、适用的运煤铲车终于试制成功了。因为铲车是他自己制造的，他就摸透了铲车的规律和性能，铲车制成了，他也成了驾驶这台铲车的熟练司机，不仅成为制造铲车的“行家”，而且成了开车的“行家”了。
    这位工人用心之苦，下功夫之深，实在是令人钦佩的。但是他为什么能有这样的苦心呢？说来很简单：他这个水暖工人，亲眼看到厂内由于人力运煤困难，尽管运煤工人日夜苦战，有的人还因太忙砸伤了脚，也还不能充足供应上煤，因而锅炉吃不饱，供汽不足，车间温度不够，汽锤也开动不起来，影响了生产。而他自己虽不是运煤工人，但是他对社会主义建设事业的耿耿忠心，使他不能坐视不理，他认为运煤是他的事业中的一部分，因而下定决心要用苦功夫来解决这个问题。问题也便这样解决了。对具体工作钻研的苦心，正是要由无限的忠心来作基础的。我们要学习这样的有心人，也愿天下有心人终成行家。成为党的事业所需要的各种“行家”。
