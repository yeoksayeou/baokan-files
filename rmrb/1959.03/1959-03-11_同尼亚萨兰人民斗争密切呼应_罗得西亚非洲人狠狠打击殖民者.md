    Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: While the flames of the national independence movement of the African people of Nyasaland raged, Africans in Southern and Northern Rhodesia also launched struggles against colonial rule, but the colonial authorities have blockaded the news.
    According to a dispatch from Lusaka, the capital of Northern Rhodesia, the colonial authorities of Northern Rhodesia did not announce until the 9th that five days earlier, more than one hundred Africans held a gathering and demonstration against the British colonialists in Mwinilunga, Northern Rhodesia. This gathering and demonstration was held when a local African National Congress leader was released after being imprisoned by the colonial authorities for six weeks. The demonstrating masses fought with colonial officials who came to suppress them. The colonial authorities arrested ten members of the African National Congress.
    Mwinilunga is located in the northwestern corner of Northern Rhodesia, close to the borders of Angola (a Portuguese colony) and the Belgian Congo.
    The dispatch stated that this incident is considered the first hint of "riots" occurring in Northern Rhodesia.
    According to a dispatch from Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, the strike by African workers at the Kariba Dam, which began on February 25, is still ongoing.
    The dam project originally had more than six thousand African workers, who were suppressed by the colonial authorities after holding a general strike on February 25, and many workers have been purged. There have been reports that a second strike broke out at the site on March 2, with fifteen to sixteen hundred Africans participating in the strike.
    The dispatch stated that only four hundred of these workers have currently returned to work.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th dispatch: Kanyama Chiume, one of the leaders of the Nyasaland African National Congress who recently arrived in Britain, said at a press conference here this afternoon that the people of Nyasaland are determined to get rid of imperialism and strive for complete independence.
    He said: "We are determined not to have anyone but ourselves as our masters." He also said that complete independence has always been the goal of the Nyasaland African National Congress. He said, "Independence must be complete; incomplete independence is not independence."
    He emphasized that he did not believe that the British government would grant independence to any of its colonies. He said that Ghana's independence was not given by the British government but was forced to be handed over. He said: "We will do our best to get rid of imperialism and want the British government to agree to our wishes."
    Chiume said that the exile of Nyasaland African National Congress leader Banda and the imprisonment of other leaders cannot stop the Nyasaland people's struggle to withdraw from the so-called Central African Federation.
    Chiume demanded that immediate measures be taken to withdraw the troops who are now slaughtering the people of Nyasaland, end the state of emergency, release Dr. Banda and other leaders, allow the African National Congress to become a legal organization and carry out activities, and immediately promulgate a new constitution that truly reflects the will of the people.
    He condemned the British Colonial Secretary and the Governor of Nyasaland for spreading rumors and slandering the Nyasaland people for "planning to massacre Europeans and Asians." He said that he detoured back to London on his way back to Nyasaland in order to inform the British public of the truth about the current situation in Nyasaland.
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The British colonial authorities are still carrying out large-scale bloody suppression of Asians in Nyasaland who are resolutely resisting colonial rule.
    Reports indicate that the colonial authorities' reinforcements have arrived in the most remote areas of northern Nyasaland—Fort Hill and Karonga—on the 10th to conduct "sweeps."

    同尼亚萨兰人民斗争密切呼应
    罗得西亚非洲人狠狠打击殖民者
    新华社10日讯　在尼亚萨兰非洲人民族独立运动怒火燎原的同时，南、北罗得西亚的非洲人也开展了反抗殖民统治的斗争，但是殖民当局封锁了新闻。
    据来自北罗得西亚首府卢萨喀的消息说，北罗得西亚殖民当局直到9日才宣布，五天前，一百多名非洲人在北罗得西亚的姆维尼隆加举行了反对英国殖民者的集会和示威。这次集会和示威是在当地的一个非洲人国民大会领袖被殖民当局监禁六个星期之后获释的时候举行的。示威群众同赶来镇压的殖民官员展开了斗争。殖民当局逮捕了非洲人国民大会的十个成员。
    姆维尼隆加位于北罗得西亚的西北角，靠近安哥拉（葡萄牙殖民地）和比属刚果的边境。
    消息说，这个事件被认为是北罗得西亚发生“骚乱”的第一个暗示。
    来自南罗得西亚首府索耳兹伯里的消息说，自2月25日开始的卡里巴水坝非洲工人大罢工目前还在持续中。
    这个水坝工程原有六千多名非洲工人，他们在2月25日举行总罢工后受到了殖民当局的镇压，有许多工人已被清洗掉。曾有消息说，这个工地在3月2日又爆发了第二次罢工，参加这次罢工的有一千五、六百非洲人。
    消息说，在这些工人中，目前只有四百名复工。
    新华社伦敦9日电　不久以前来到英国的尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的领导人之一卡尼亚姆·丘梅今天下午在这里的记者招待会上说，尼亚萨兰人民决心摆脱帝国主义和努力争取完全的独立。
    他说：“我们已下定决心，除了自己外，不要别人当我们的主人”。他又说，完全的独立始终是尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的目标。他说，“独立必须是完全的，不完全的独立就不是独立”。
    他强调说，他并不认为，英国政府会给它的任何一个殖民地以独立。他说，加纳的独立不是英国政府给的，而是被迫交出来的。他说：“我们将尽力摆脱帝国主义并且要英国政府同意我们的愿望。”
    丘梅说，放逐尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会领袖班达和囚禁其他的领袖不能制止尼亚萨兰人民的要求退出所谓中非联邦的斗争。
    丘梅要求立即采取措施，撤走现在正在抢杀尼亚萨兰人民的军队，结束紧急状态，释放班达博士和其他领袖，让非洲人国民大会成为合法组织而进行活动，立刻颁布一部真正反映人民意志的新宪法。
    他斥责英国殖民地大臣和尼亚萨兰总督造谣诬蔑尼亚萨兰人民在“有计划地屠杀欧洲人和亚洲人”。他说，他在返回尼亚萨兰的途中折回伦敦是为了把尼亚萨兰目前形势的真相告知英国公众。
    据新华社10日讯　英国殖民当局仍在对坚决反抗殖民统治的尼亚萨兰亚洲人进行大规模的血腥镇压。
    有消息说，殖民当局的增援部队在10日已开到尼亚萨兰北方最偏僻的地区——希尔堡和卡龙加——进行“扫荡”。
