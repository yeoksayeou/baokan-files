Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 11th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued at 4 p.m. today. Comrade Zhu De, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation and Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting.

  Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Naszkowski spoke at the meeting. He said that the balance of power in the world has undergone a decisive change in favor of the socialist camp. Now, the superior strength of our camp has become the factor determining peace or war. Since the Second World War, a socialist camp including one billion people has been formed, and the victorious working class in these countries is loyal to the principles of peaceful coexistence and a policy of peace.

  Naszkowski said that the rapid economic development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has increased the superiority of socialism over capitalism. Contrary to the fallacies spread by revisionists in our country in the past, and contrary to the fallacies published by Yugoslav revisionists in foreign policy, if our camp did not have an advantage over the capitalist world, and if we could not restrain the adventurous forces of the imperialist camp, then no positive peace offensive could ease world tension.

  Nairovsky, Secretary of the Party Organization of Copernicus University in Bydgoszcz Province, said in his speech that the majority of university students tend to be socialist. The main problem in educating young people is first to cultivate professors and strengthen Marxist-Leninist education. Whether students can learn Marxism-Leninism well largely depends on the professors and teachers. He advocated setting up courses in Marxism-Leninism and political economy in universities.

  Motyka, First Secretary of the Krakow Provincial Committee, spoke next. He said that Krakow Province successfully completed the work dedication movement before the Third Congress. In this movement, workers put forward more than 3,000 suggestions, and the masses greatly improved their political enthusiasm.

  When talking about the party's ideological work, Motyka said that there had been some weakening of ideological work in the past, and the party organization should strengthen its work in the creative circles. The creative circles should not only be required to have patriotism, but also to make their works play an educational role for the people; art is not a commodity.

  Cheboch, Secretary of the Swidnica County Committee, and a worker representative from the Nowotko Metallurgical Plant also spoke at the afternoon meeting.

  Rudolf Barak, head of the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, addressed the Congress. He said: Our party and your party stand on the same front of building socialism, and are engaged in a common struggle. The socialist camp is more consolidated than ever. We have opposed the attacks of the revisionists against us. Now our task is to actively carry out the peaceful competition of socialism with capitalism.

  Hermann Matern, head of the German Socialist Unity Party delegation, sent a congratulatory message to the Congress. He said that the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party is of great significance to Poland's socialist construction. He said that the Soviet Union's proposal to sign a peace treaty with Germany is encouraging to the German people. If West Germany is unwilling to sign a peace treaty, the German Democratic Republic will sign a peace treaty with all countries willing to sign a treaty with us. We must firmly defend the peaceful border of the Oder-Neisse River. Thanks to the cooperation of socialist camp countries, we will certainly be able to smash any plans of the warmongers. Matern then read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party.

  The speeches of Barak and Matern were warmly welcomed by the audience.

  Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 12th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued to discuss the summary report of the Central Committee's work at the morning meeting on the 12th.

  At the beginning of the meeting today, the executive chairman of the congress, Grek, secretary of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, announced to the congress that the representative of the Mexican Communist Party, member of the Central Committee of the Mexican Communist Party, Cardenas, arrived here last night to participate in the congress.

  Afterwards, Grek told the congress that in memory of the third anniversary of the death of B. Beirut, a delegation composed of Ochab, Jarosinsky, and Kozdera laid a wreath at the Beirut Mausoleum in the name of the Third Congress of the Party.

  Polish Minister of National Defense Spehalski was the first to speak in today's discussion. In his speech, he emphasized that the Polish army is the armed force of the Polish people. Under the leadership of the United Workers' Party, it has had, has now, and will have in the future, an inseparable link with the people who are building socialism. The Polish army, together with the armies of all socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, is fighting for world peace and security.

  When talking about the development of the armed forces, he said that the Polish armed forces have reached a good level of modernization in terms of both the quantity and quality of equipment.

  When talking about the cadres of the armed forces, Spehalski said that they are the cadres of the party. We can proudly point out that about 70% of our officers are members of the Polish United Workers' Party, and about 90% are children of workers and peasants.

  Spehalski said that the party organization in the Polish army has strengthened its opposition to revisionist attempts to weaken the army, and to the dogmatic negative attitude towards the army.

  Spehalski said that the unity of the socialist camp countries and their strong will to defend peace and socialism are reflected in the defense alliance of socialist countries—the Warsaw Pact. He pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an aggressive treaty, is a treaty full of internal contradictions and disintegration. In contrast, the Warsaw Treaty Organization is becoming more and more consolidated and united, and the mutual coordination between the armies of the treaty participating countries is also increasing.

  Jarosinsky, secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and first secretary of the Warsaw Municipal Committee, then spoke. He said that the party organization in the capital fully supports the party's general line and the line of the Eighth Plenary Session. Jarosinsky said that the Warsaw Party organization pays special attention to the danger of revisionism. The period of factional activities and ideological confusion is over. Revisionists have played a major role among intellectuals, but now they have lost their support.

  Jarosinsky then talked about the construction of Warsaw and the work of the party in Warsaw. He said that the party's work is better than before, but there are still imbalances in political and ideological principles and the elimination of ideological confusion. He demanded that the party take a firm attitude towards incorrect views. He believes that accommodating some incorrect views can only paralyze the party's thinking and harm the party's unity.

  Renk, the first secretary of the Polish Socialist Youth League, said in his speech that the Polish youth movement was chaotic during 1956 and 1957. Young people have learned a severe political lesson. They have gone through a difficult path. Revisionists have tried to turn young people into nihilists, but they will not succeed. Only the party and our seven-year development plan can allow young people to see their future. We should use all methods to promote socialist ideas to young people.

  Then, Shpalnik, the representative of the Lenin Steel Plant, spoke.

  Longgo, head of the Italian Communist Party delegation and general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory message at the meeting. He talked about the domestic political situation in Italy. He said that the Italian Communist Party will unite all forces that can be united in the country to fight for peace.

  Fix, head of the French Communist Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory message at the conference, saying, "We fully support the Soviet Union's proposal on the German issue and Poland's proposal for a European nuclear-weapon-free zone. We believe that the Oder-Neisse River border is inviolable."

  Longgo and Fix's congratulatory messages were warmly welcomed by the conference.

  Matwin, First Secretary of the Wroclaw Provincial Committee, then spoke. He pointed out that the movement before the Third Congress of the Party showed the correctness of the Party's line. He said that now the whole party has been closely united around the Central Committee of the Party. Due to the consolidation of the party, we can complete even greater tasks.

  Matwin then talked about the construction situation in Wroclaw Province. He suggested the establishment of an institution to combat irresponsibility in work, and to strengthen the sense of responsibility of the supervisory departments.

  Jaworski, First Secretary of the Warsaw Provincial Committee, said in his speech that at the time of the convening of the Third Congress of the Party, our party is more united than ever before. The party organizations in Warsaw Province support the party's line and the party's leadership.

  Jaworski talked about the great achievements made by Warsaw Province in implementing the new agricultural policy. He pointed out that the propaganda and organizational work of agricultural collectivization should be strengthened. He said that collectivization will not arise spontaneously, and there are still various revisionist theories, such as that the individual economy is eternal, and that agricultural groups can also develop socialism, etc., which are unfavorable to farmers.

  When talking about cultural work, he said that we have had many discussions, but there is not much practical action. We must strengthen this aspect of work, strengthen theoretical and ideological work, and continuously improve the political and ideological level of party members.

  Dud, head of the British Communist Party delegation and vice chairman of the Executive Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech to the conference. He said that the people of Britain and Poland have a traditional friendship. This friendship was developed in the struggle against Hitler. He introduced the struggle of the British working class to the conference.

  Also speaking at the morning meeting today were representatives from the "Iron Will" factory and Tatarkovna, First Secretary of the Lodz Municipal Committee. In the afternoon, the conference continued.

    波统一工人党代表大会继续举行
    各地代表支持党的路线主张加强思想教育
    捷德意法英等国兄弟党向大会致贺词
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会今天下午四时继续举行。中国共产党代表团团长、中共中央副主席朱德同志在会上致了词。
  波兰外交部副部长纳希科夫斯基在会上发了言。他说，现在世界力量对比发生了有利于社会主义阵营的决定性的变化。现在，我们阵营的优势力量成为决定和平还是战争的因素。因为第二次世界大战后，形成了有包括十亿人口的社会主义阵营，这些国家中胜利的工人阶级忠实于和平共处的原则和和平政策。
    纳希科夫斯基说，苏联和其它社会主义国家经济的迅速发展使社会主义对资本主义的优势增长了。和我国过去修正主义者散布的谬论相反，和南斯拉夫修正主义者在对外政策中所发表的谬论相反，假如没有我们阵营对资本主义世界的优势，假如我们不能制止帝国主义阵营的冒险力量，那么，任何积极的和平攻势都不能缓和世界紧张局势。
  比得哥煦省哥白尼大学党组织书记奈洛夫斯基在发言中说大学生中大部分是倾向于社会主义的。教育青年的主要问题首先是培养教授和加强马克思列宁主义教育，学生能否学好马列主义在很大程度上是看教授和教师。他主张在大学中应设马克思列宁主义和政治经济学课程。
  克拉科夫省委会第一书记莫蒂卡接着发言。他说，克拉科夫省胜利地完成了第三次代表大会前的工作献礼运动。在这运动中，工人提出三千多条建议，群众大大提高了政治积极性。
    在谈到党的思想工作时，莫蒂卡说，过去思想工作曾有一些削弱的现象，党组织应加强在创作界的工作。对创作界不仅应要求他们有爱国主义，而且应使他们的作品对人民起教育作用，艺术不是商品。
    在下午会议上发言的还有希维德尼察县委员会书记切波奇和诺伏特科冶金厂工人代表。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团团长、捷共中央政治局委员鲁道夫·巴拉克向大会致了词。他说：我们的党和你们的党站在一条建设社会主义的战线上，共同进行着斗争。社会主义阵营比任何时候都巩固了，我们反对了修正主义者对我们的攻击，现在我们的任务是积极进行社会主义同资本主义的和平竞赛。
    德国统一社会党代表团团长赫尔曼·马特恩向大会致贺词。他说，波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会对波兰的社会主义建设具有重大意义。他说，苏联提出的签订对德和约建议对德国人民起着鼓舞作用。如果西德不愿签订和约，德意志民主共和国将同所有愿同我们签订和约的国家签订和约。我们要坚决保卫奥得—尼斯河的和平疆界。由于社会主义阵营国家的合作，我们将一定能粉碎战争狂人的任何计划。马特恩接着宣读了德国统一社会党中央委员会的贺电。
    巴拉克和马特恩的讲话受到全场的热烈欢迎。
    新华社华沙12日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会12日上午会议继续讨论中央委员会的工作总结报告。
    今天在会议开始时，大会执行主席、统一工人党中央委员会书记格雷克向大会宣布，前来参加代表大会的墨西哥共产党代表、墨西哥共产党中央委员卡德纳斯昨天晚间到达这里。
    随后，格雷克告诉大会说，为了纪念波·贝鲁特逝世三周年，由奥哈布、雅罗辛斯基和科兹德腊组成的代表团，以党的第三次代表大会的名义向贝鲁特陵墓献了花圈。
  波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基在今天讨论中第一个发言。他在发言中强调指出，波兰军队是波兰人民的武装力量，它在统一工人党领导下，过去、现在和将来都同建设社会主义的人民有着不可分割的联系。波兰的军队同所有社会主义国家、首先是苏联的军队共同为世界和平与安全而斗争。
    在谈到武装力量的发展时，他说，波兰武装部队无论在装备的数量和质量上都达到了良好的现代化水平。
    斯彼哈尔斯基在谈到武装部队的干部时说，他们是党的干部。我们可以自豪地指出，我们的军官约有70％是波兰统一工人党党员，约有90％是工农子弟。
    斯彼哈尔斯基说，波兰军队中的党组织加强了反对修正主义削弱军队的企图，反对教条主义对军队的消极态度。
    斯彼哈尔斯基说，社会主义阵营国家的团结一致及其保卫和平与社会主义的坚强意志，表现在社会主义国家的防御联盟——华沙条约中。他指出，北大西洋公约组织这个侵略性条约，是内部矛盾重重、分崩离析的条约。与此相反，华沙条约组织却日益巩固、日益团结，条约参加国军队之间的相互配合也在日益增进。
  波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记、华沙市委员会第一书记雅罗辛斯基接着发言。他表示，首都的党组织完全支持党的总路线、八中全会的路线。雅罗辛斯基说，华沙党组织特别注意修正主义的危险。现在派别活动和思想混乱的时期已经过去了。修正主义者在知识分子中起过很大作用，但现在他们已失去了支持。
    雅罗辛斯基接着谈到华沙的建设，谈到了华沙的党的工作情况。他说，党的工作比以前好了，但在政治思想原则性和消除思想混乱等方面还有不平衡现象。他要求党对不正确观点采取坚决态度。他认为，迁就一些不正确观点只能瘫痪党的思想，损害党的团结。
  波兰社会主义青年联盟第一书记伦克　在发言中说，在1956年到1957年期间波兰青年运动是混乱的。青年上了政治上的严厉的一课，他们走过了困难的道路，修正主义者企图把青年变为虚无主义者，但是他们是不能得逞的。只有党和我国的七年发展计划，才能使青年看到自己的前途。我们应该用一切方法向青年宣传社会主义思想。
    接着，列宁钢铁厂的代表什帕尔尼克发了言。
  意大利共产党代表团团长、意大利共产党总书记隆哥在会上致了贺词。他谈到了意大利的国内政治情况。他说，意大利共产党将团结国内一切可以团结的力量，为和平而斗争。
  法国共产党代表团团长、法共中央政治局委员费克斯在大会上致贺词说，我们完全支持苏联关于德国问题的建议和波兰的欧洲无原子武器区的建议。我们认为，奥得—尼斯河边界是不可侵犯的。
    隆哥和费克斯的贺词受到了大会的热烈欢迎。
  弗罗茨瓦夫省委员会第一书记马特温随后发言。他指出，党的第三次代表大会前的运动，表明了党的路线的正确。他说，现在，全党已经紧密地团结在党中央的周围。由于党的巩固，我们可以完成更大的任务。
    马特温接着谈到了弗罗茨瓦夫省的建设情况。他建议成立一个机构，对工作中的不负责任现象进行斗争，同时也加强监察部门的责任感。
  华沙省委员会第一书记雅沃尔斯基发言说，在召开党的第三次代表大会的时候，我们党比过去任何时候都更加团结了。华沙省的党组织都支持党的路线和党的领导。
    雅沃尔斯基谈到华沙省在执行新农业政策方面获得很大成绩。他指出，应该加强对农业合作化的宣传和组织工作。他说，合作化不会自发产生，现在还有各种修正主义理论，如说个体经济是永恒的，农业小组也可以发展社会主义等，这对农民是不利的。
    谈到文化工作问题时，他说，我们进行了许多的讨论，但实际行动不多，必须加强这方面的工作，必须加强对理论工作和思想工作，不断提高党员的政治思想水平。
  英国共产党代表团团长、执行委员会副主席杜德向大会致了祝词。他说，英波两国人民有着传统的友谊。这种友谊在反希特勒的斗争中得到了发展。他向大会介绍了英国工人阶级的斗争。
    在今天上午会议上发言的还有：“钢铁意志”工厂的代表和罗兹市委员会第一书记塔塔尔科夫娜。下午，大会继续举行。
