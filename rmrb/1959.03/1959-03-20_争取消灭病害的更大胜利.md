    Strive for Greater Victory in Eliminating Diseases

    Eliminating diseases is a grand ideal for humanity. However, completely eradicating diseases is an extremely arduous and long-term task. But, first eliminating some of the most prevalent and serious diseases harming people's health is a miracle that can be achieved early in our era of the people.

    The great goal for 1959 in eliminating diseases is to basically eliminate the four major pests—rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes—wherever possible, and to basically eliminate the five major parasitic diseases—schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, kala-azar, and hookworm disease—as well as other endemic diseases that most seriously endanger people's health. This is a glorious political task to promote a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    Past reactionary rulers were indifferent to the suffering of the people, leading to the widespread prevalence of the five major parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis and other diseases that most seriously endangered people's health in many areas of our country. The broad masses of people have dreamed of eliminating these diseases for generations. From the day it was founded, our Party has shown the greatest sympathy and concern for the suffering of the people, and immediately launched the prevention and control of the five major parasitic diseases after the national liberation. With the leadership of the Party and the people's conscious demands, once mobilized and organized, the people can exert unparalleled strength and wisdom, can come up with many ways to overcome various difficulties, and can accelerate the elimination of many serious diseases. Simao County in Yunnan Province is a famous ultra-high malaria area both in China and abroad. Before liberation, the incidence of malaria was as high as 90%. After liberation, through years of active prevention and control, especially since the great leap forward in the work of eliminating diseases in 1958, the incidence of malaria there has dropped to 0.37%. In the past year, the achievements made on the national front of eliminating diseases have greatly exceeded the total achievements made in the eight years since liberation: more than 3.17 million schistosomiasis patients were treated, equivalent to three times the total number of people treated in the eight years since liberation, and 60% of the regions have basically eliminated schistosomiasis; more than 30 million hookworm patients were treated, equivalent to five times the number of people treated in the eight years since liberation; more than 2.4 million filariasis patients were treated, equivalent to sixteen times the total number of people treated in the eight years since liberation; more than 90% of kala-azar patients have been treated. Other endemic diseases, such as venereal diseases, goiter, and Kashin-Beck disease, have also been eliminated or controlled in many epidemic areas. Through the practice of the great leap forward in eliminating diseases in 1958, we have explored some effective experiences in eliminating diseases: that is, under the leadership of the Party, implement the policy of active prevention and treatment, adopt comprehensive prevention and control measures, combine prevention and control work with production, combine science and technology with mass movement, adhere to repeated struggles, and eliminate diseases quickly, well, and economically. These valuable experiences are also a guarantee for us to make greater leaps forward in the battle to eliminate diseases in 1959.

    Comrade Mao Zedong told us that in doing any work, we must strategically despise difficulties and tactically pay attention to difficulties; we must have both soaring enthusiasm and the spirit of scientific analysis. This correct instruction must also be implemented in the work of eliminating diseases. The achievements of the pest elimination and disease prevention work in 1958 are huge, but we must never be complacent and paralyzed by the existing achievements. The achievements we have already made are still far from the overall goal of eliminating diseases nationwide, and the tasks before us are still very arduous and very complex. The development of work in various regions is also uneven, and the quality of work in some regions is not high enough. The vectors and intermediate hosts of infectious diseases, such as mosquitoes, flies, and snails, reproduce very quickly. If they are not eliminated thoroughly, they will disappear today, but if we relax a little, they will reproduce again after a while, so we must persist and struggle repeatedly. That is to say, to basically eliminate certain diseases, we must also conduct re-examinations and eradicate them as soon as possible; even if they are eradicated, we must observe them for a long time and strictly prevent a resurgence. We must make our enthusiasm higher and higher, make our work more and more meticulous, and we must not be complacent or relaxed in any aspect of the work or in any region.

    The work of eliminating diseases must be closely integrated with production. For example, combined with fertilizer accumulation, we can vigorously manage human and animal manure, which is not only conducive to fertilizer accumulation, but also conducive to eliminating diseases. The successful experience of combining production and serving production to eliminate diseases is extremely rich. Many regions have put forward the slogan of "one shot three rings" in snail eradication. One shot is to drain the river water; three rings are to dig mud for fertilizer, improve irrigation, and eliminate snails. Many regions have put forward the slogan of "one shot five rings" in manure management. One shot is to manage manure well; five rings are to accumulate more fertilizer to improve fertilizer efficiency, eliminate parasite eggs, eliminate flies, reduce gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and improve the rural sanitation environment. The treatment of general chronic diseases can also be interspersed during production gaps, trying to avoid hindering production as much as possible. And after the patients are cured, they can provide more labor for production. According to statistics from Hunan Province, the labor capacity of more than 300,000 schistosomiasis patients cured in the province has been restored and enhanced to varying degrees, which is equivalent to transporting about 100,000 laborers to the production front. In Qian Dingjia Wan She in Shijiaqiao Township, Changde County, 720 of the 1,393 people in the whole She suffered from schistosomiasis. In 1956, the total labor base score of the whole She was 2,470 points. After schistosomiasis was basically eliminated in 1958, the labor base score increased to 3,872 points, which is equivalent to an increase of 140 strong laborers. These examples prove that as long as we work with full enthusiasm and analyze and study with our brains, we will come up with more and better ways to combine production and eliminate diseases.

    In the work of eliminating diseases, we must also conscientiously implement the "two legs walking" policy of combining Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining medical personnel and the masses, and combining scientific research and prevention and treatment practice. Mobilizing the broad masses of Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in the work of eliminating pests and diseases can not only solve the difficulties of insufficient medical personnel and insufficient medicines, but also greatly improve the efficiency of eliminating diseases through the technical cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses. Because Changde County, Hunan Province, lacked "tetrachloroethylene" (Western medicine) for treating hookworm disease, they relied on the masses, followed the mass line, and formulated "Guanzhong Decoction" (Chinese medicine), which was used to treat hookworm patients with a curative effect of more than 80%. The raw materials for this Chinese medicine are abundant, can be obtained locally, are cheap, and are safe and convenient to take. In addition to generally conducting political and ideological education for Chinese and Western medicine and medical scientific research workers, strengthening the concept of serving the people, and helping some people overcome the idea of not being content with rural work, etc., we must focus on conducting education on implementing the Party's Chinese medicine policy, mobilize Chinese and Western medicine to unite and cooperate, and explore the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine to serve current production. Also, actively and systematically training and cultivating health workers for people's communes, timely studying and identifying and promoting effective prescriptions excavated or newly created among the masses are important ways to accelerate the development of the work of eliminating diseases.

    The first quarter of this year is about to pass, and spring plowing and production are developing vigorously everywhere. While strengthening leadership in production, Party committees at all levels should also strengthen leadership in medical and health work. Medical and health departments at all levels should closely integrate with production, use production gaps, quickly mobilize all positive factors, and immediately further grasp the work of eliminating pests and diseases firmly and well. In particular, we must take advantage of the time around the Qingming and "May 1st" festivals to carry out a massive shock movement. After the shock movement, we must also, based on the specific situation, combine and do a good job in the health work of the communes and the prevention and treatment of other diseases, and establish a regular system for eliminating diseases. All medical and health workers and medical science and technology personnel on the prevention and treatment front must make their enthusiasm higher and higher, make their work more in-depth and meticulous, strengthen technical guidance, ensure the quality of work, and strive for greater achievements in the prevention and treatment of diseases this year, and ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    争取消灭病害的更大胜利
    消灭病害，是人类的一个远大的理想。要完全消灭病害，却是一项十分艰巨十分久远的任务。但是，首先消灭普遍流行的、危害人民健康最严重的一些病害，在我们这个人民的时代，却是完全能够早日实现的奇迹。
    1959年在消灭病害方面的伟大目标，是在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇和蚊子四个大害，基本上消灭血吸虫病、疟疾、孑孓虫病、黑热病和钩虫病五个大寄生虫病以及其他危害人民健康最严重的地方病。这是促进今年更大更好更全面跃进的一项光荣的政治任务。
    历代反动统治者，对人民疾苦漠不关心，以致血吸虫病等五大寄生虫病和其他危害人民健康最严重的疾病，在我国许多地区普遍流行。广大群众世世代代梦寐以求地希望消灭这些疾病。我们党从成立的一天起，就对人民的疾苦寄予最大的同情和关怀，在全国解放以后，立即开展了对五大寄生虫病的防治工作。有党的领导，有群众的自觉要求，一经发动和组织，人民群众就可以发挥出无可比拟的力量和智慧，就可以想出很多办法来克服各种困难，就能够加速地消灭很多严重的疾病。云南省思茅县，是中外驰名的超高度疟疾区，解放以前，疟疾发病率曾经高达90％。解放以后，经过历年的积极防治，特别是在1958年消灭病害工作大跃进以来，那里的疟疾发病率已经下降到0.37％。去年一年，全国在消灭病害战线上所取得的成绩，大大超过了解放八年来所取得成绩的总和：治疗血吸虫病患者三百十七万多人，相当于解放八年来治疗总人数的三倍，有60％的地区已经基本上消灭了血吸虫病；治疗钩虫病患者三千多万人，相当于解放八年来治疗人数的五倍；治疗丝虫病患者二百四十多万人，相当于解放八年来治疗总人数的十六倍；黑热病患者，已治疗了90％以上。其他，如性病、甲状腺肿、大骨节病等地方病，也在许多流行地区分别被消灭或控制住。通过1958年消灭病害大跃进的实践，我们已经摸索到了一些消灭病害的有效经验；这就是在党的领导下，贯彻执行积极防治方针，采取综合性防治措施，防治工作与生产结合，科学技术与群众运动结合，坚持反复斗争，多快好省地消灭疾病。这些宝贵的经验，也是我们1959年在消灭病害的战线上能够更大跃进的保证。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，做任何工作都必须在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难；既要有冲天的干劲，又要有科学分析的精神。在消灭病害工作中也必须贯彻这一正确的指示。1958年除害灭病工作的成绩是巨大的，但决不能陶醉于已有的成绩而自满麻痹。我们已经取得的成绩，离在全国范围内消灭病害的总目标还十分遥远，摆在我们面前的任务还是非常艰巨，非常复杂。各地工作的发展也不平衡，有的地区的工作质量还不够高。传染疾病的媒介和中间宿主，像蚊蝇和钉螺等都孳生很快，如果消灭得不彻底，今天不见了，稍一放松，过一个时候，又会繁殖起来，所以必须坚持不懈，反复斗争。这就是说，要基本消灭某些病害，还必须进行复查，尽早做到根除；即使根除了，也要长期观察，严防死灰复燃。我们必须干劲越鼓越足，工作越做越细，无论从那一方面的工作或那一地区的工作来说，丝毫不能自满松懈。
    消灭病害工作必须密切结合生产。例如结合积肥，就可以大力开展管理人畜粪便，既有利于积肥，又有利于消灭病害。结合生产，为生产服务，进行消灭病害的成功经验是极为丰富的。不少地区在灭螺方面提出“一炮三响”的口号，一炮是戽干河水；三响是挖泥积肥、改善灌溉、消灭钉螺。不少地区在管理粪便方面提出“一炮五响”的口号，一炮是管好粪便；五响是多积肥料提高肥效、消灭寄生虫卵、消灭苍蝇、减少肠胃传染病和改善农村卫生面貌。对于一般慢性疾病的治疗，也可以穿插在生产空隙进行，尽量做到不妨碍生产。而病人被治愈以后，却可以为生产提供更多的劳动力。据湖南省统计，全省治愈的三十多万血吸虫病人，劳动能力都有了不同程度的恢复和增强，等于为生产战线输送了约十万个劳动力。常德县石家桥乡前丁家垸社，全社一千三百九十三人中有七百二十人患血吸虫病，1956年全社劳动底分二千四百七十分，1958年基本消灭血吸虫病以后，劳动底分增加到三千八百七十二分，等于增加了一百四十个强劳动力。这些事例证明，只要鼓足干劲去工作，开动脑筋去分析研究，结合生产消灭病害的办法是会越想越多、越想越好的。
    在消灭病害的工作中，还必须认真贯彻中西医结合，土洋结合，医务人员和群众结合，以及科学研究与防治实践相结合等“两条腿走路”的方针。发动广大中医参加除害灭病工作，不仅可以解决医务人员数量不足和药物不足的困难，而且经过中西医在技术上的合作，互相取长补短，还可以大大提高消灭疾病的效率。湖南省常德县因为治疗钩虫病缺乏“四氯乙烯”（西药），他们就依靠群众，走群众路线，配制成了“贯仲汤”（中药），用它治疗钩虫病人疗效达到80％以上。这种中药的原料丰富，既可以就地取材，价钱便宜，服用的时候还安全方便。对中西医和医学科学研究工作人员，除一般地对他们进行政治思想教育，加强为人民服务的观念，帮助某些人克服不安心农村工作的思想等以外，要着重进行贯彻党的中医政策的教育，发动中西医团结合作，发掘祖国医学遗产为当前的生产服务。还有，积极地有计划地为人民公社训练培养卫生工作人员，及时研究鉴定并推广群众中挖掘出来或新创造的有效药方，对加速消灭病害工作的开展，都是重要的办法。
    今年第一季度将要过去了，春耕生产正在各地热气腾腾地开展，各地党委在加强领导生产的同时，还应该加强对医药卫生工作的领导。各地医药卫生部门应该密切结合生产，利用生产空隙，迅速调动一切积极因素，立即进一步把除害灭病工作抓紧抓好。特别要趁清明、“五一”节前后，大搞突击运动。在突击运动以后，还须根据具体情况，结合作好公社的卫生工作和防治其他疾病，建立起经常的消灭病害的制度。所有防治战线上的医疗卫生工作人员、医学科学技术人员，要把干劲越鼓越足，把工作越做越深入细致，加强技术指导，确保工作质量，争取今年防治病害工作的更大成就，保证今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
