Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 17th. The French Ministry of the Interior released last night the final results of the French municipal elections.

    The Ministry of the Interior's report avoids mentioning the number of votes obtained by each party in the election and only lists the figures for the distribution of municipal council members, so as to avoid touching upon the fact that the French Communist Party received a large number of votes.

    Although the undemocratic election law makes the number of municipal council seats won by the French Communist Party disproportionate to the number of votes it received (for example, in the Seine province, the French Communist Party received more votes this time than in the 1953 municipal elections, but the number of elected municipal council members decreased from the original 934 to 870), still 20,454 Communist candidates were elected as municipal council members. The Communist Party maintained many of the municipal councils it originally led and gained control of some new municipal councils. For example, in the important Parisian suburban towns, 30 of the 80 municipal councils are now under Communist control, two of which were added in this election. The attempt by Frey, former Secretary-General of the Union for the New Republic and Minister of Government Propaganda, to "besiege the Communist municipal governments" before the election has failed. "Paris Daily" had to admit, when talking about this situation, that "the (Paris) Red suburbs have not faded."

    In the second round of voting, wherever the Communist Party's list was leading among the left-wing parties, the Communist Party received votes from Republicans. In some electoral districts where some right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party openly formed alliances with right-wing parties, many Socialist voters voted for Communist candidates. This is because the French Communist Party is the most resolute opposition party and the main force for the democratic alliance that people hope to achieve.

    Even the bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" said, "The number of votes obtained by the (left-wing) joint lists in the second round of voting is often more than the sum of the votes they obtained in the first round. ..." For example, this is the case in Montpellier, Albi, and Brest. "Liberation" commented on the election results today, saying, "Not only has the opposition to the authoritarian regime established by De Gaulle strengthened, but, in particular, the 'myth' about De Gaulle has been completely shattered."

### 反动力量围攻法共的阴谋遭到失败  法共获得两万多市政委员席位

    反动力量围攻法共的阴谋遭到失败
    法共获得两万多市政委员席位
    新华社巴黎17日电　法国内政部昨晚发表了法国市政选举的最后结果。
    内政部这个报告避而不谈各党派在选举中得票的情况，只列举了市政委员会委员分配的数字，以免触及法国共产党得票众多的事实。
    尽管不民主的选举法使法国共产党在选举中所得的市政委员席位同所得票数不成比例（以塞纳省为例，法国共产党这次得票比1953年的市政选举时候要多，但是当选的市政委员却从原来的九百三十四人减少到八百七十人），仍旧有二万零四百五十四个共产党候选人当选市政委员。共产党保持了许多原来由它领导的市政委员会，并且新取得了一些市政委员会的控制权，例如在重要的巴黎郊区市镇，八十个市政委员会中有三十个现在在共产党控制下，其中两个是这次选举中增加的。保卫新共和联盟前总书记、政府宣传部长弗雷在选举前所叫嚷的“围攻共产党市政府”的企图已告失败。“巴黎日报”在谈到这种情况时候也不得不承认，“（巴黎）红色郊区并未退色”。
    在第二轮投票时，凡是共产党的名单在左翼党派中领先的许多地方，共产党就得到了共和人士的选票。在有些社会党右翼领袖公开同右翼党派结成联盟的选区，许多社会党选民投了共产党候选人的票。这是由于法国共产党是最坚决的反对派，是人们盼望实现的民主联盟的主要力量。
    连资产阶级报纸“世界报”也说，“（左翼）联合名单在第二轮投票时取得的选票，往往比它们在第一轮投票时所得选票总和还多。……”例如，在蒙彼利埃、阿耳比、布勒斯特就是如此。“解放报”今天在评论选举结果时候说，“不仅反对戴高乐建立的专制政权的反对派加强了，而且，特别是关于戴高乐的‘神话’完全破灭了”。
