    Xinhua News Agency, March 14th dispatch from Lusaka, the capital of Northern Rhodesia: The flames of Central African people's resistance against colonial rule, ignited by the brutal suppression of British colonial authorities, have spread to Northern Rhodesia. According to the colonial authorities, after banning the Zambian African National Congress on the 12th, Africans in Lusaka fought against the authorities with sticks, stones, and gasoline bombs made from bottles, resulting in nine incidents.
    The colonial authorities have dispatched police cars and police officers wielding thick sticks to patrol and suppress the Lusaka area.
    Meanwhile, the situation in Nyasaland remains tense. A dispatch from Blantyre states that the British Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Perth, held a day-long secret meeting on the 13th with the British Governor of Nyasaland, Armitage, and other colonial officials. While they were holding the meeting, British colonial authorities carried out a larger-scale suppression of Africans in Nyasaland.
    According to the British colonial officials themselves, colonial police raided the villages of Salima and Chiboka in the Central Province on the night of the 12th. They used tear gas on the crowds and arrested and detained forty-nine Africans. In the early morning of the 13th, the colonial authorities arrested sixty-one Africans in the Bembuf area south of Limbe in the Southern Province.
    Sources say that the Nyasaland colonial authorities took amphibious actions on the 13th to intensify the suppression. In the Northern Province, colonial police traveled by barge from Karonga into the deep bay area of Lake Nyasa, landed there, and arrested two leaders of the African National Congress. In the southern part of the Central Province, more police crossed the Mlozi River on rafts made of car tires and "swept" some villages in the early morning, arresting twenty-five Africans.
    On the 13th, the colonial authorities also distributed more leaflets in the Kota Kota area of the Central Province of Nyasaland, threatening Africans to hand over weapons and ammunition to the local administrative centers or police stations before March 16, otherwise they would be severely punished.
    However, it is reported that African resistance activities continue to emerge one after another. The severely damaged highways in the Northern Province are still impassable in some areas. The chairman of the Asian Congress of Nyasaland, Indian lawyer Sagpar Sakhlani, demanded the release of the arrested African leaders on the 13th. In a speech, he said that there is no doubt that the arrested African National Congress leaders have strong support from Africans in this country; "As long as the Africans are still in prison, it is impossible to negotiate the future of Nyasaland."
    He also expressed that he is not opposed to Nyasaland's independence outside the British-imposed "Federation." He said that this is undoubtedly the wish of all African leaders. There are more than 10,000 Asians, mainly Indians, in Nyasaland.

    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 13th: The British Communist Party distributed leaflets today demanding the release of the imprisoned Africans and calling for support for the struggle of Africans against the rule of a minority of Europeans.
    The leaflet said, "Terror and death are rampant among the African people of Nyasaland who live under British rule."
    The leaflet continued, "Under the pressure of a handful of Rhodesian white settlers, a 'state of emergency' has been declared, and troops and armed police have been sent to launch an offensive against the Africans. The Conservative government fully supports this 'state of emergency'."
    The leaflet, in talking about the shocking conditions in Nyasaland, said that the ratio of Africans to Europeans in Nyasaland is three hundred and fifty to one, but only a very small number of Africans enjoy the right to vote. Only one in three African children gets a little schooling, and less than one in a thousand receives secondary education. There is only one doctor for every 32,000 Africans.
    The leaflet said, "The Africans of Nyasaland are only asking to obtain the right to live, to vote, and to manage their own affairs. They know from bitter experience that white settler rule means endless poverty and oppression. Therefore, they have always opposed the establishment of a federation with Northern and Southern Rhodesia, because this would strengthen white control."
    The Communist Party finally demanded an end to the state of emergency in Nyasaland, the withdrawal of troops, the release of the imprisoned Africans, and the granting of the right to vote to Africans and the right to decide their own future.

    中非反殖民统治烈火继续蔓延
    殖民当局野蛮镇压激起非洲人更猛烈的反抗
    英国共产党号召支持尼亚萨兰人民的正义斗争
    新华社14日讯　北罗德西亚首府卢萨喀消息：在英国殖民当局残酷镇压下燃起的中非人民反抗殖民统治的烈火已经蔓延到北罗德西亚境内。据殖民当局宣布，在12日取缔了赞比亚非洲人国民大会之后，非洲人在卢萨喀以棍棒、石块和用瓶子做的汽油弹同当局展开了斗争，发生了九起事件。
    殖民当局已派出警车和拿着粗棍的警察在卢萨喀地区巡逻镇压。
    同时，尼亚萨兰的局势仍然很紧张。来自布兰太尔的消息说，英国协办殖民地事务国务大臣佩思在13日同尼亚萨兰英国总督阿米塔季和其他殖民官员举行了一整天的秘密会谈。就在他们举行会谈的时候，英国殖民当局对尼亚萨兰非洲人进行了更大规模的镇压。
    据英国殖民官员自己宣布，殖民警察在12日夜间曾袭击了中央省的萨利马和契博卡村庄。他们向群众使用了催泪弹，并逮捕和扣留了四十九个非洲人。在13日清晨，殖民当局又在南方省林贝以南的本布弗地区逮捕了六十一个非洲人。
    有消息说，尼亚萨兰殖民当局在13日已经采取两栖行动来加紧镇压。在北方省，殖民警察从卡龙加乘了驳船驶入尼亚萨湖深湾地区，在那里登陆并逮捕了两个非洲人国民大会的领袖。在中央省南部，更多的警察乘了用车胎做的筏子渡过磨河，在清晨“扫荡”了一些村庄，逮捕了二十五个非洲人。
    殖民当局13日还在尼亚萨兰中央省的科塔科塔地区散发了更多的传单，威胁非洲人在3月16日以前把武器和弹药交给当地的行政中心或警察局，否则，要受到严厉的处罚。
    但是，据报道，非洲人的反抗活动仍然此起彼伏。遭到严重破坏的北方省的公路，在某些地区仍无法通行。尼亚萨兰的亚洲人大会主席、印度律师萨格帕尔·萨克拉尼13日要求释放被逮捕的非洲领袖。他在一次谈话中说，毫无疑问那些被逮捕的非洲人国民大会领袖在这个国家得到非洲人的强烈拥护；“只要非洲人仍在监狱里，就不可能谈判尼亚萨兰的前途”。
    他还表示不反对尼亚萨兰在英国强加的“联邦”以外独立。他说，这无疑是一切非洲领袖们的愿望。在尼亚萨兰有一万多名亚洲人，主要是印度人。
    新华社伦敦13日电　英国共产党今天散发传单，要求释放被监禁的非洲人，并且号召支持非洲人反对少数欧洲人的统治的斗争。
    传单说，“在生活在英国统治下的尼亚萨兰非洲人民中间，恐怖和死亡在逞凶”。
    传单继续说，“在一小撮罗得西亚白种移民的压力下，宣布了‘紧急状态’，军队和武装警察被派来对非洲人发动进攻。保守党政府全力支持这种‘紧急状态’。”
    传单在谈到尼亚萨兰的骇人听闻的状况时说，在尼亚萨兰，非洲人和欧洲人之比是三百五十比一，但是却只有为数很少的非洲人享有选举权。三个非洲儿童中只有一个得到一点上学的机会，一千人中受中等教育的还不到一人。在每三万二千个非洲人中，只有一个医生。
    传单说，“尼亚萨兰的非洲人所提出的只不过是想获得生活、选举以及管理他们自己事务的权利。他们从痛苦的经历中知道，白种移民的统治意味着无止境的贫困和压迫。因此他们一直反对同南北罗得西亚建立联邦，因为这会加强白种人的控制。”
  共产党最后要求结束尼亚萨兰的紧急状态，撤退军队，释放被监禁的非洲人，让非洲人有选举权和决定自己前途的权利。
