Xinhua News Agency, March 21st -- This year, national vegetable production will see significant development. Currently, various regions have arranged the year's vegetable production in accordance with the principle of "local production, local supply." According to the arrangements of twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the vegetable planting area this year will increase by about 50% compared to last year. If no particularly severe natural disasters are encountered, the total vegetable output will greatly increase compared to last year. Because vegetable production is more susceptible to disasters than other crops, various regions generally arranged for some extra planting area as an insurance factor when planning this year's vegetable production. Various regions believe that on this basis, meeting the needs of urban and rural people for vegetables is entirely possible.

Currently, the spring vegetable planting season has arrived in various southern regions, and vegetable farmers in various places are busily engaged in planting work. Twelve cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Nanjing, Hefei, and Jinan, plan to plant 2.05 million mu of spring and summer vegetables, of which 1.7 million mu have already been planted or are about to be planted. Hubei Province had planted 1.15 million mu as of early March, accounting for half of the annual plan.

When arranging this year's vegetable production, various regions have not only paid attention to the increase in quantity, but also to the diversity of varieties. Shanghai has arranged a total of 180 vegetable varieties this year, requiring that ten varieties be available in every season (including snow cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, spinach, broad beans, etc.) and ten varieties be available every month (chicken feathers, potatoes, leeks, onions, etc.). Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces have successfully test-planted pickled mustard greens. The three northeastern provinces will also expand the planting area of onions, ginger, and other vegetables this year.

Party and government leading departments in various places attach great importance to this year's vegetable production. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee proposed that other crops in the old suburban areas of cities should give way to vegetables to ensure the necessary vegetable planting area. Beijing Municipality regards vegetable production as the most important task of the people's communes in the near suburbs. Changsha City has repeatedly emphasized that the "marshal" of agricultural production in the suburbs is vegetables. Many large and medium-sized cities have set self-sufficiency in vegetables with a surplus this year as their goal. Therefore, they have not only arranged sufficient planting area, but also made arrangements for both self-sufficient production and commercial production of the people's communes in the suburbs. For commercial vegetables, specialized teams are generally established, and fixed personnel are engaged in production. Kunming's suburbs have established 104 vegetable specialized teams and more than 200 specialized groups, with more than 15,000 people in the city engaged in vegetable production. More than 200,000 people in Beijing's suburbs have also been designated to grow vegetables. Henan Province implements the method of "two unified and three specialized," that is, unified production arrangements, unified personnel management, specialized labor, specialized animal power, and specialized land, so that vegetable production has a reliable guarantee.

Agricultural and commercial departments in various regions have done a lot of work to promote the development of vegetable production. They first concentrated their efforts on solving the seed problem for spring and summer vegetables. Some places have established seed bases or vegetable seed specialized teams, and some places have adopted methods such as door-to-door purchasing, regional cooperation, mutual exchange of needs, variety regulation, and transplanting of seedlings. Commercial departments in various places have also generally signed production and sales contracts with local agricultural departments to fix production and supply plans. In order to regulate the off-season and peak season of vegetables, commercial departments in various places have already begun preparations for the processing and storage of vegetables in the peak season.

### 蔬菜也要大丰收  今年全国蔬菜播种面积比去年增加一半

    蔬菜也要大丰收
    今年全国蔬菜播种面积比去年增加一半
    新华社21日讯　今年全国蔬菜生产将有很大的发展。目前各地已经按照“就地生产、就地供应”的方针，对全年的蔬菜生产作了安排。根据二十七个省、市、自治区安排的结果，今年蔬菜的播种面积将比去年增加百分之五十左右，如果不遇到特大自然灾害，蔬菜的总产量将会比去年大大增加。由于蔬菜生产比别的作物容易遭灾，各地在安排今年的蔬菜生产时，一般都比计划多安排了一些播种面积，作为保险系数。各地认为在这样的基础上，满足城乡人民对蔬菜的需要是完全可能的。
    目前，南方各地春菜播种季节已到，各地菜农已紧张地投入播种工作。上海、广州、杭州、长沙、郑州、武汉、重庆、昆明、贵阳、南京、合肥、济南等十二个城市，计划播种春夏菜二百零五万亩，已经播种或即将播种的有一百七十万亩；湖北省截至3月上旬已播种一百十五万亩，占全年规划的一半。
    各地在安排今年蔬菜生产时，不仅注意到数量的增加，而且注意到花色品种多样。上海市今年共安排了一百八十个蔬菜品种，要求做到十个品种季季有（包括雪菜、花菜、番茄、菠菜、刀豆等），十个品种月月有（鸡毛菜、洋山芋、韭菜、洋葱等）。湖南、湖北等省已经试种榨菜成功。东北三省今年还要扩大洋葱、生姜等的播种面积。
    各地党政领导部门对于今年的蔬菜生产十分重视。中共辽宁省委提出，在城市老郊区其他作物要给蔬菜让路，保证必要的蔬菜播种面积；北京市将蔬菜生产列为近郊各人民公社头等重要的任务；长沙市一再强调郊区农业生产的“元帅”是蔬菜。许多大、中城市都把今年内做到蔬菜自给有余作为自己的努力目标，因此他们不但安排了足够的播种面积，而且对郊区人民公社自给性生产和商品性生产都分别作了安排。对于商品菜，一般都建立专业队，固定专人从事生产。昆明市郊区已经建立一百零四个蔬菜专业队和二百多个专业组，全市有一万五千多人投入蔬菜生产。北京郊区确定专门种菜的也有二十多万人。河南省实行“两统、三专”的办法，即生产统一安排、人员统一管理，劳力专责、畜力专业、土地专用，使蔬菜生产有了可靠的保证。
    各地农业和商业部门，为了促进蔬菜生产的发展，做了许多工作。他们首先集中力量解决春夏菜的种子问题，有的地方建立了种子基地或菜籽专业队，有的地方采取上门收购、地区协作、互通有无、调剂品种、点种移栽等办法。各地商业部门还普遍同当地农业部门签订产销合同，把生产与供应计划固定下来。为了调剂蔬菜淡季和旺季，各地商业部门现在就已经开始旺季蔬菜加工贮存的准备工作。
