    Korean "March 1st" Movement

　　Under the influence of the October Revolution, on March 1, 1919, the Korean people launched a large-scale patriotic movement in Seoul to resist Japanese imperialism. On this day, 300,000 people from all walks of life in Seoul held a massive demonstration. Patriots issued a "Declaration of Independence," opposing the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism and advocating for Korean independence. The patriotic demonstration that broke out in Seoul immediately spread to all parts of Korea. From the start of the "March 1st" Movement until the end of 1919, 211 out of 218 prefectures and counties throughout Korea held more than 3,200 demonstrations and riots. More than two million Korean workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, urban residents, patriotic religious figures, and national capitalists participated in this struggle, which fully demonstrated the patriotic spirit and revolutionary spirit of the Korean people. In many places, the masses even used clubs and axes to attack Japanese police, constabulary, and local government institutions. The slogan "Long live Korean independence!" resounded throughout the country. This patriotic movement unfortunately failed under the brutal suppression of Japanese imperialism, but it had a significant impact on the national liberation struggle of the Korean people for freedom and independence in the future.

    朝鲜“三·一”运动
　　1919年3月1日，朝鲜人民在十月革命的影响下，在汉城开展了规模巨大的反抗日本帝国主义的爱国运动。这一天，汉城各界人民三十万人举行了大示威，爱国主义者发表了“独立宣言”，反对日本帝国主义的殖民统治，主张朝鲜独立。汉城爆发的爱国示威运动立即波及到全朝鲜各地，从“三·一”运动开始至1919年年底，全朝鲜二百一十八个府郡中有二百一十一个府郡举行了三千二百多次示威和暴动，朝鲜的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、市民、爱国宗教界人士和民族资本家达二百万人以上参加了这个充分显示朝鲜人民爱国精神和革命气概的斗争。许多地方的群众甚至使用棍棒和斧头去袭击日本的警宪和地方政权机构。“朝鲜独立万岁！”的口号响彻全国。这次爱国运动在日本帝国主义残酷镇压下不幸遭到失败，但是这个运动对于以后朝鲜人民为争取祖国自由和独立而进行的民族解放斗争发生了重大的影响。（苏）
