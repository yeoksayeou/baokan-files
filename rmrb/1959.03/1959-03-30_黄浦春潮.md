    Huangpu Spring Tide
    The Huangpu River surges with waves,
    Red flags flutter across the ten-mile river.
    Giant ships rise in smoke and roar loudly,
    Wooden boats row urgently, sails full with wind.
    Unable to fully carry the leaping progress reports,
    Every day brings new creations and innovations;
    The technical revolution's wave is broad,
    In the sound of the whistles, the spring tide is high.
              (Fanting)

    黄浦春潮黄浦江上浪滔滔，十里江面红旗飘。巨轮升烟发大吼，木船橹急风帆饱。载不尽跃进捷报，日日有刷新创造；技术革命波浪阔，汽笛声里春潮高。
