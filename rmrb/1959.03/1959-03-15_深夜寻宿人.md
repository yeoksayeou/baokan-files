Late at night, with the northwest wind blowing, a pedicab carrying an elderly lady who had just gotten off the train arrived at the Tianqiao Eryou Hotel seeking accommodation. The staff asked her if she was cold, made inquiries about her comfort, poured tea, and provided water, treating her with great warmth. However, the old lady remained downcast, her brow furrowed, and she kept her head lowered, saying nothing. As the night deepened, the old lady remained awake and was secretly shedding tears. Although the staff had noticed that the old lady had some unresolved worries, they felt it wasn't appropriate to ask directly. They simply said with concern, "Old lady! It's late, you should rest." After a while, the old lady finally spoke, saying that she had come to Beijing to find her daughter. Before leaving, she had arranged to meet her daughter at the station, but they missed each other. She lost the letter containing her daughter's address on the way, which is why she was anxious. After questioning her for some time, the old lady only said that her daughter was at the "College of Science" (理学院). But there is no "College of Science" in Beijing! The staff asked around, but no one knew. The staff called the Tianqiao Police Station to report the old lady's difficulties. The police chief immediately assigned police officer Kang Yongshun to go to the hotel to help the old lady find her daughter's address.

Kang Yongshun opened the phone book and searched through the entire schools section, but there was no College of Science. There are so many universities in Beijing, and it was late at night, where could he possibly look? With no other choice, he repeatedly flipped through the phone book, carefully examining the Mining Institute, Petroleum Institute, Agricultural Mechanization Institute, and many other institutes, again and again. Suddenly, he remembered the old lady's Sichuan accent. "College of Science," could it be that she was mispronouncing the characters? Then what college could it be? Mining, petroleum, and agriculture didn't match the pronunciation! The Forestry Institute in the phone book appeared before his eyes. Forestry Institute, College of Science, repeatedly practicing the Sichuan accent and comparing them, he felt like he had discovered a secret. He immediately called to inquire. The response he received almost made him jump for joy. The old lady's daughter did indeed work at the Forestry Institute.

Found her!

The old lady, the police officer, and the hotel staff were all overjoyed. None of them slept that night.

    深夜寻宿人
    夜里，吹着西北风，一辆三轮车拉着一位刚下火车的老太太，来到天桥二友旅店投宿。服务员问冷问热，泡茶倒水，热情招待，可是这位老太太一直愁眉不展，低头不语。夜深了，老太太一直不睡，并在暗暗落泪。服务员虽已发现老太太有难解的心事，又觉得不好急问，只是关心地说：“老太太！天不早了，该您休息了”。停了一会老太太终于开口了，说她是来北京找女儿的，动身前约女儿到车站接，没有接着，带的女儿的通信地址路上丢掉了，因而着急。服务员问了半天，老太太只说是在“理学院”。北京哪有一个“理学院”呢？服务员问谁也不知道。服务员打电话到天桥派出所反映老太太的困难情况，所长立刻指派民警康永顺，到旅店里帮助老太太找到她女儿的住址。
    康永顺翻开电话簿找遍整个学校栏也没有个理学院。北京那么多高等院校，又是深夜，哪儿查去呀？没有办法，就一次再一次的翻着电话簿，矿业学院、石油学院、农业机械化学院和很多学院一遍又一遍地细看。他忽然想起老太太的四川口音来了，“理学院”，莫不是把字念错了？那又是什么学院呢？矿业、石油、农都不合声啊！电话簿上的林业学院出现在眼前了，林学院、理学院，反复学着四川的口音对照着，他像发现了什么秘密似的，马上打电话问一问。对方的回答几乎使他跳起来，老太太的女儿确实在林业学院工作。
    找到了！
    老太太、民警、服务员一齐高兴，这一夜他们都没有睡觉。
