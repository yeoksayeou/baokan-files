Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th: Hong'an and Macheng counties in Hubei, both well-known throughout the country, recently exchanged "battle reports," setting off a friendly competition of mutual learning, mutual comparison, and mutual catching up. The people of both counties are determined to plant the red flag of greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward even higher this year, maintaining and promoting their glory.

Now, inspired by the friendly competition, the vast numbers of cadres and commune members in these two counties are stepping up their efforts in spring plowing preparation and field management of summer-harvest crops with soaring enthusiasm. In Hong'an County, wheat has generally been top-dressed three times, with half of the wheat fields reaching about one million seedlings per mu. In Macheng County, wheat is also growing well due to strengthened field management. Both counties are better prepared for spring plowing than in the same period last year. The spring plowing production campaign is about to be fully launched.

In 1957, Hong'an and Macheng counties were already two red flags in Hubei Province. In 1958, both counties continued to exert great effort, and through competition, they continuously collaborated and promoted each other. Although both suffered from severe natural disasters last year, the overall agricultural production and construction still developed at a tremendous rate. The yields of major crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, peanuts, and rapeseed in both counties increased by 50% to more than double compared to the bumper harvest of 1957, and other rural economic undertakings also made considerable progress.

This year, in order to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, both counties recently used the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, and great debates to summarize the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, formulate this year's leap forward plans, and decided to launch another round of friendly competition. Macheng County's slogan is: Learn from Hong'an, catch up with Hong'an, with one heart and one mind, hold high the red flag, and advance victoriously. Hong'an County's slogan is: Match Macheng in drive, learn from Macheng in technology, catch up with Macheng in crop production, and surpass Macheng in per household income. The planned total output and average yield per mu of various major crops in both counties will be doubled on the basis of last year. Hong'an County's targets are: to double the total grain output, increase the total oil crop output by one and a half times, and strive to quintuple the total cotton output. Macheng County's targets are: to increase the total grain and oil crop output by more than double, and to achieve three years' worth of cotton production in one year (compared to 1958). Both counties have also planned to vigorously develop diversified economies, requiring that the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations reach about 1,000 yuan per capita.

In order to achieve this year's leap forward plan, both counties have formulated specific organizational and technical measures in accordance with the spirit of "10 points for targets, 12 points for measures, and 24 points for effort." Some of the important measures that are common to both are: 1. Continue to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, establish and improve various systems on the basis of continuous summing up of experience, improve the level of management, and better give play to the great superiority of the communes. 2. Further implement the mass line, improve the style of work of cadres, strengthen ties with the masses, and in particular, fully utilize and develop the experience of planting experimental fields and organizing appraisals and competitions, and implement the method of "cadres taking the lead in doing, and innovation first experimenting" in all work. 3. In order to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, both counties have also decided to continue to implement the responsibility system of cadres being assigned to specific areas under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and at the same time, both counties have transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level. 4. Vigorously carry out the technical revolution movement, and resolutely implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in different seasons; launch a new upsurge of "everyone learning technology and everyone reforming (improving) technology" in rural areas. 5. On the basis of strengthening political and ideological work, extensively and deeply carry out a nationwide competition to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, seize the red flag, and protect the red flag, and combine the competition within the county with the competition with other counties, so that the competition becomes a driving force for promoting common leap forward. 6. Vigorously cultivate large areas of high-yield fields, use high-yield fields to drive the overall situation, reduce and eliminate backward fields, and strive for balanced and large-scale increases in production.

    保持光荣　再争上游
    红安、麻城互学互赶，共同跃进
    新华社武汉10日电　全国著名的湖北红安、麻城两县最近互送战表，掀起了互学、互比、互赶的友谊竞赛。两县人民决心要在今年把更大更好更全面的跃进红旗插得更高，保持光荣和发扬光荣。
    现在，这两个县的广大干部和社员，在友谊竞赛的鼓舞下，正以冲天的干劲加强备耕工作和夏收作物田间管理。红安县的小麦已经普遍追肥三次，有半数麦田每亩麦苗达到一百万株左右。麻城县的小麦由于加强了田间管理，也长得很好。两县的春耕准备工作，都比去年同期好。春耕生产运动即将全面展开。
    红安、麻城两县1957年就是湖北省的两面红旗。1958年两县继续鼓足干劲，并且通过竞赛不断地互相协作和互相促进，虽然去年都遭到了特大的自然灾害，但整个农业生产建设仍然以巨大的速度向前发展了。两县水稻、小麦、棉花、花生、油菜籽等主要作物的产量，都分别比大丰收的1957年增加了50％到一倍以上，其他农村经济事业也有较大的发展。
    今年，为了力争实现更大更好更全面的跃进，这两个县都在最近用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，总结了去年大跃进的成绩和经验，制订了今年的跃进规划，并且决定再次开展友谊竞赛。麻城县的口号是：学红安，赶红安，一条心，一股劲，高举红旗，乘胜前进。红安县的口号是：干劲比麻城，技术学麻城，庄稼赶麻城，每户收入超麻城。两县规划的各种主要农作物总产量和平均亩产量，都将在去年的基础上成倍地增加。红安县的指标是：粮食总产量翻一番，油料总产量增加一倍半，棉花总产量力争翻五番。麻城县的指标是：粮食、油料总产量都要增加一倍多，棉花总产量一年顶三年（1958年）。两县还都规划了大力发展多种经济，要求农、副业总产值按人口平均计算每人达到一千元左右。
    为了实现今年的跃进规划，两县都根据“十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲”的精神，制定了具体的组织、技术措施。其中具有共同性的几项重要措施是：一、继续整顿和巩固人民公社，在不断总结经验的基础上建立和健全各项制度，提高经营管理水平，更好地发挥公社的巨大优越性。二、进一步贯彻群众路线，改进干部作风，加强和群众的联系，特别是要充分运用和发展种试验田和组织评比、竞赛等方面的经验，在各项工作中贯彻“干部带头干、革新先试验”的方法。三、为了加强对农业生产的领导，两县还都决定继续实行在党委的统一领导下干部分片包干的责任制，同时两县还都下放了大批干部充实基层的领导。四、大力开展技术革命运动，根据不同季节狠狠地贯彻农业“八字宪法”；在农村中掀起“人人学技术、个个改（进）技术”的新高潮。五、在加强政治思想工作的基础上，广泛深入地开展全民性的学先进、赶先进、夺红旗、保红旗的大竞赛，并且把县内竞赛和同外县的竞赛结合起来，使竞赛成为推动共同跃进的动力。六、大力培育大面积高产田，通过高产田带动全面，减少和消灭落后田，争取平衡大增产。
