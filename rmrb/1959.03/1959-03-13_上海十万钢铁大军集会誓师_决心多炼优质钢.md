Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 12th. Shanghai's 100,000 steelworkers have launched a grand competition to seize 1.6 million tons of steel. On the 10th, more than 2,800 representatives from steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rolling, copper smelting, and refractory materials factories across the city held a leaping-forward rally. Representing 100,000 metallurgical workers, they declared: We must stretch, pick the fruit, and be one and a half times as productive, determined to strive to complete and overfulfill the glorious tasks assigned by the Party and the state this year. We will not withdraw until a complete victory is won.

At the leaping-forward rally, factories competed against factories, furnaces against furnaces, and work types against work types. The first to issue a challenge was Han Xinliang, a young furnace chief representing the open-hearth furnace of the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, which last year held high the national red flag for high open-hearth furnace production. On behalf of all the workers of the open-hearth furnace, he challenged the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, with the conditions: The average utilization coefficient for the entire year should reach 16.820, and the fourth quarter should reach 18.174; the qualified rate of steel for the whole year should reach 99.5%. Furthermore, produce more high-quality steel to cast better castings for machinery factories manufacturing rolling mills and mining equipment. Immediately following was Wu Hefeng, a representative of the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which is fiercely chasing Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. On behalf of the workshop workers, he proposed to the conference: the utilization coefficient in the second half of the year must reach 18, and they will work hard for half a year to ensure that the high-yield red flag returns to Plant No. 1. Their action slogan for achieving the indicators is: "Grasp every shift, grasp every furnace, seize every second, and don't give up every ounce," and they must achieve mechanization of charging, motorization of slag removal, and scientific operation to break through the four major barriers of production, quality, raw materials, and furnace protection.

Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, which has been doing everything possible to turn bad materials into good steel this year, thereby achieving a double leap in output and quality, proposed at the meeting to carry out a friendship competition with the city's converter workshops. The factory's employees are enthusiastically carrying out a red flag competition between shifts, determined to do a great job in March, achieving over-planning every month and full success every month. Their guarantee is: regardless of good iron or bad materials, they will refine it into good steel; using existing equipment, the steel output this year will be increased by more than 40% compared with last year, and the average qualified rate of steel will reach more than 99%. The representative of the new converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, which was just completed last year, then took the stage to respond to the proposal of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, expressing their willingness to learn humbly from various factories and their determination to enter the ranks of the advanced in the competition.

The representative of Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory proposed at the conference that the utilization coefficient of the two electric furnaces should be increased from an average of 31 last year to 48 this year, and to reach 72 in the fourth quarter, and use this to respond to the proposal made by Benxi Steel Plant to the whole country. Their slogan is: Learn from Benxi, catch up with Dalian, and seize the national red flag for high-yield electric furnaces.

Competition between soldiers and soldiers, generals and generals, was also very enthusiastic among rolling mills. Xin Hu Steel Plant declared war on its counterparts in the city with the indicators that this year's output will be increased by 58% compared with last year, and labor productivity will be more than doubled, and immediately received the challenge from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 10, which is "small in size but high in ambition."

The representative of Shanghai's first blast furnace workshop, which will soon be put into production, also stated at the conference: We must produce, learn, and improve at the same time, and ensure that we produce iron quickly, produce more iron, and produce good iron, and supply it to steelmaking plants to make good steel. In addition, representatives of cast steel, refractory materials, and other industries expressed their determination to fight for steel this year at the conference.

    上海十万钢铁大军集会誓师
    决心多炼优质钢
    新华社上海12日电　上海十万钢铁工人誓夺一百六十万吨钢的大竞赛已经展开。10日，全市炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、炼铜、耐火材料等工厂的二千八百多名代表举行了跃进誓师大会。他们代表十万名冶金工人表示：一定要跳一跳，把果子摘下来，一个人抵一个半人，决心为完成和超额完成今年党和国家交给的光荣任务而奋斗。不获全胜决不收兵。
    在跃进誓师大会上，厂对厂、炉对炉、工种对工种展开了一场比武竞赛。首先提出挑战的，是去年高举全国平炉高产红旗的上钢三厂平炉的代表——青年炉长韩忻亮。他代表平炉全体工人，向上钢一厂平炉车间提出挑战，条件是：今年全年利用系数平均要达到十六点八二○，第四季度达到十八点一七四；全年钢的合格率达到99.5％。并且，要炼出更多的优质钢，为机械厂制造轧钢机、矿山设备等浇铸更多更好的铸件。紧接着发言的，是猛追上钢三厂的上钢一厂平炉车间代表吴鹤凤。他代表车间工人向大会提出：下半年利用系数要达到十八，苦战半年誓让高产红旗回一厂。他们实现指标的行动口号是：“班班抓，炉炉抓，分秒必争，斤两不让”，并且要实现进料机械化、出渣车子化、操作科学化，来猛闯生产、高质、原料、护炉四大关。
    今年以来千方百计向坏料要好钢，从而获得产量、质量双跃进的上钢六厂，在会上倡议同全市转炉车间开展友谊竞赛。这个厂的职工正在热火朝天地开展班与班之间的红旗竞赛，决心在3月大干一场，做到月月超计划、月月满堂红。他们的保证是：不管好铁还是坏料，都要炼成好钢；利用原有设备，使今年钢产量比去年再提高40％以上，钢的合格率平均达到99％以上。去年刚建成的上钢五厂新转炉车间的代表，接着上台响应上钢六厂的倡议，表示虚心向各厂学习，决心在竞赛中列入先进行列。
    上海机修总厂的代表在大会上提出，今年要使两只电炉的利用系数从去年的平均三十一提高到四十八，四季度要达到七十二，并且以此来响应本溪钢厂向全国提出的倡议。他们的口号是：学本溪，赶大连，夺取全国电炉高产红旗。
    兵对兵、将对将的竞赛在轧钢厂中间也进行得非常热烈。新沪钢铁厂以今年产量比去年提高58％、劳动生产率提高一倍以上的指标，向全市同行宣战，马上就得到“厂小志气高”的上钢十厂应战。
    日内即将投入生产的上海第一个高炉车间的代表也在大会上表示：要边生产、边学习、边提高，保证快出铁、多出铁、出好铁、供给炼钢厂去炼好钢。此外，还有铸钢、耐火材料等代表在大会上表示了今年为钢而战的决心。
