Welcome to Qinghai

Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Recently, the People's Daily has forwarded us many letters from young friends, and many people have written to us directly, asking to come to Qinghai to contribute to the construction of Qinghai. These letters come from all over the country, from the Songliao Plain in the north to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei and Guangdong in the south, from the coast of the Yellow Sea in the east to the Sichuan Basin in the west; there are workers, farmers, students, and cadres. These letters from all directions have a common desire, which is to love the border areas of the motherland and have the great ambition to build the border areas. Your vigorous and enthusiastic spirit has deeply moved and encouraged the hundreds of thousands of employees and people of all ethnic groups working in Qinghai. Every letter is a source of strength for comrades working in the border areas.

Qinghai is a place with vast land and abundant resources, but with a small population. It is an undeveloped or newly developed virgin land of the motherland. On the vast area of ​​820,000 square kilometers, there are several major mountain ranges such as Qilian, Kunlun, Tanggula, and Altun, and two major basins, Qaidam and Hoh Xil, covering tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. There are more than one hundred rivers such as the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Datong River, and the Huangshui River, and more than one hundred inland lakes such as Qinghai Lake. In these mountains, plains, rivers, and lakes, there are extremely rich mineral resources, hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of vast grasslands, and tens of millions of acres of flat, fertile arable land suitable for farming. Geological work has only been carried out on a quarter of such a vast area, mainly concentrated in the Qilian Mountains and the Qaidam Basin. However, more than 70 kinds of mineral deposits have been discovered, as well as more than 50 kinds of chemical elements. Everyone knows about the petroleum in the Qaidam Basin. Among the 110 oil-bearing structures that have been discovered, 40 structures are being drilled, and 34 have already produced crude oil or shown oil and gas, with the highest well producing 800 tons of crude oil per day and 1 million cubic meters of gas per day. In addition to oil, various ferrous, non-ferrous, rare metals and non-metallic mineral deposits are constantly being discovered. The estimated reserves of edible salt alone are as high as 100 billion tons, enough for the 600 million people in the country to eat for many years, and it is inexhaustible. Many salt lakes grow new salt as they are mined. Some have accumulated into a kind of mineral salt over the years because they have never been mined, and are as hard as stone. The reserves of potassium-magnesium salt are estimated to be more than 200 million tons in only two salt lakes. Therefore, oil workers call Qaidam the "oil basin" and "oil sea", and geologists call it a "treasure basin", which cannot be considered an exaggeration. In the future, it will have the conditions to gradually become one of China's large-scale petroleum bases, chemical bases and non-ferrous metal bases.

The Qilian Mountains are praised by geologists as the "treasure mountain" and "the Urals of China", which is also reasonable. Twenty-eight kinds of mineral deposits, including copper, iron, coal, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, sulfur, gold, silver, oil shale, gypsum, and limestone, and more than 140 mineral locations have been discovered. After more than four years of geological work, the situation is very good, and many mineral deposits have extremely rich reserves, making them large or extra-large deposits. No work has been carried out on the Kunlun and other three mountains, but many mineral locations of iron, copper, coal, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, and crystal have been discovered. A large iron ore belt with a length of more than 300 kilometers and a coal mine belt of more than 100 kilometers have been discovered on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. The reserves of crystal in the Tanggula Mountains and copper mines in Yushu are quite large.

In the vast pastoral areas, herds of livestock roam the lush and vast grasslands. There are currently more than 10 million livestock in the province. The pastoral areas have vast grasslands, totaling more than 800 million mu, which can greatly develop livestock. Even if it develops several times more, the grasslands will not be a problem, and in most places, wheat, highland barley and other grain crops can be planted, and agriculture and animal husbandry can be combined to greatly develop grain and feed production. Pastoral areas are rich in leather, wool, milk, and also produce a large number of valuable medicinal materials such as pilose antler, musk, rhubarb, and cordyceps sinensis, as well as various exotic birds and wild animals.

Qinghai has fertile land. Last year, the average yield of grain per mu in the province reached 400 jin, and many high-yield miracles appeared. The average yield per mu of more than 10,000 mu of spring wheat in Delingha Farm reached more than 1,000 jin, and Seshek Farm also created a national high-yield record of 8,585 jin per mu of wheat. According to preliminary investigations, there are also more than 30 million mu of wasteland in pastoral areas waiting for people to reclaim it.

Qinghai has broad prospects for development in both industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, and urgently awaits more manpower to develop and build it.

In the nine years since liberation, Qinghai has made great achievements in the socialist revolution and various construction undertakings. Now the agricultural areas have all realized the people's commune system. After the anti-feudal struggle since last year, the pastoral areas have also basically realized the people's commune system. The socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses of all ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly improved, and they are full of enthusiasm and soaring energy. There are already more than 700 industrial enterprises above the county level in the province, with more than 330,000 employees. The total industrial output value has reached more than 300 million yuan, which is dozens of times higher than the 15 handicraft factories, more than 1,000 employees, and 4 million yuan output value at the time of liberation. Grain output has also increased from less than 600 million jin in 1949 to 2.2 billion jin. The total number of livestock has increased from more than 7 million to more than 12 million. Cities and factories, farms and pastures have been built on many deserted grasslands and wastelands; highways extend in all directions beside the Kunlun Mountains, on the top of the Qilian Mountains, on the banks of the Yangtze River, on the banks of the Yellow River, and on the vast grasslands; hundreds and thousands of geological exploration personnel, with the heroic spirit of "drilling through thousands of layers of soil in the Gobi and traversing the ten thousand mountains of Kunlun", are exploring treasures from the earth; countless heroic sons and daughters have reclaimed thousands of years of virgin land with their own hands, planting grain and vegetables; tens of thousands of railway employees, with the spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way", are engaged in a tenacious battle with steep mountains, rivers, frozen soil, and beaches, determined to build railways to the Qaidam Basin and the Tibetan Plateau as soon as possible, transporting countless treasures from Qinghai to all parts of the country, and transporting various industrial equipment and agricultural and animal husbandry machinery from all parts of the country to factories, farms, pastures and people's communes in the vast areas of Qinghai.

These achievements have been made under the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao; and with the active help and enthusiastic support of all parts of the country. Hundreds of thousands of employees in Qinghai come from all over the country; every machine, every ton of steel, and every large agricultural implement in Qinghai also come from all over the country. Since the Great Leap Forward, fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have transported a large amount of materials, manufactured a large amount of equipment for us, helped us train a large number of employees, and also sent a large number of technical personnel, including tens of thousands of railway employees, and hundreds of thousands of young people who actively came to Qinghai to participate in construction. This year, Henan Province will also have tens of thousands of young land reclamation team members come to Qinghai with their own small farm tools to reclaim land and participate in construction undertakings. We express our heartfelt thanks for these. However, to completely change the face of Qinghai, build Qinghai, and develop various underground and above-ground resources to play a role in the socialist construction of the motherland, in addition to mainly relying on the efforts of the more than 2 million people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, we also sincerely hope that fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will continue to give us strong support, especially labor and technical support. Without a large influx of population and a large increase in labor, it is impossible for Qinghai to be built faster and better. Therefore, we warmly welcome young friends from all over the country to participate in the construction of Qinghai, whether male or female, workers or farmers, young students or technical personnel.

Let us build a paradise on earth together on this newly developed virgin land of the motherland!

    欢迎你们到青海来
    中共青海省委第一书记　高峰
    最近以来，人民日报给我们转来了不少青年朋友的信，也有不少人曾直接写信给我们，要求到青海来，为建设青海贡献自己一份力量。这些信来自祖国各地，北至松辽平原，南至江浙湖广，东至黄海之滨，西至四川盆地；有工人，有农民，有学生，有干部。这些来自四面八方的信，都有一个共同的愿望，就是热爱祖国的边疆，具有建设边疆的伟大志向，你们这种朝气蓬勃、热情洋溢的精神，使在青海地区工作的数十万职工和各族人民群众深受感动和鼓舞，每一封信，都是给在边疆工作的同志的力量。
    青海，是地大物博、人口很少的一个地方，是祖国一块未开发或刚开发的处女地。在八十二万平方公里的辽阔面积上，有祁连、昆仑、唐古拉、阿尔金等几大山脉，有十几万和几万平方公里的柴达木、霍霍希里两大盆地、长江、黄河、大通河、湟水等一百多条河流，有青海湖等一百多个内陆湖泊。在这些山、原、河、湖中，有着极为丰富的矿藏资源，有着数十万平方公里的辽阔草原，和数千万亩宜农的平坦、肥沃的可垦荒地。在这样广阔的面积上，进行了地质工作的只有四分之一，主要集中在祁连山和柴达木盆地，但是，已经发现的矿藏即达七十余种，还有各种化学元素五十多种。柴达木盆地的石油是大家都知道的，在已发现的一百一十个储油构造中，正在钻探的四十个构造就有三十四个喷出原油或有油气显示，最高的井日喷原油八百吨，日喷气一百万立方公尺。除了石油以外，各种黑色、有色、稀有金属和非金属矿藏，不断在发现。仅食盐储量估计即达一千亿吨，够全国六亿几千万人吃好多年，而且它是取之不尽、用之不竭的，许多盐湖随挖随在生长新盐。有的因从未被人开采，多年已积成一种矿盐，坚硬如石。钾镁盐仅二个盐湖调查估计，储量即为两亿多吨。所以，石油工人叫柴达木是“油盆子”、“油海子”，地质人员叫“聚宝盆”，都不能算是夸张。它将来完全有条件逐步成为我国大型的石油基地、化工基地和有色金属基地之一。
    祁连山被地质人员誉为“万宝山”、“中国的乌拉尔”，也是有道理的。已发现铜、铁、煤、铬、镍、铅、锌、硫、金、银和油页岩、石膏、石灰石等二十八种矿藏，一百四十余处矿点，经过四年多时间的地质工作，情况很好，许多矿藏储量极丰，为大型或特大型的矿床。昆仑等三个山还未进行工作，但也发现不少铁、铜、煤、铬、镍、铅、锌、水晶等矿点。昆仑山北坡即发现一个长达三百余公里的大型铁矿带和一百多公里的煤矿带。唐古拉山的水晶、玉树的铜矿储量都很不少。
    在广大的畜牧业地区，一群群的牲畜，出没在丰美辽阔的草原上。全省现有一千多万头牲畜。牧区草原辽阔，共约八亿余亩，可以大量发展牲畜，即使再发展几倍，草原亦不成问题，而且多数地方还可以种植小麦，青稞等各种粮食作物，可以实行农牧结合，大量发展粮食、饲料生产。牧区盛产皮、毛、奶类，并出产大量鹿茸、麝香、大黄、冬虫草等名贵药材和各种奇禽、野牲。
    青海土地肥沃，去年全省粮食平均亩产已达到四百斤，并出现了许多高额丰产奇迹。德令哈农场一万多亩春小麦，平均亩产达到千斤以上，赛什克农场还创造了小麦亩产八千五百八十五斤的全国高产纪录。据初步调查，牧业区还有着三千余万亩荒地，等待着人们去开垦它。
    青海无论工农牧业，都有着远大的发展前途，迫切地等待着有更多的人力去开发它、建设它。
    解放九年多来，青海地区的社会主义革命和各项建设事业，都取得巨大成绩。现在农业区已全部实现了人民公社化，牧业区经过去年以来的反封建斗争，也基本实现了人民公社化，各族广大群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟空前提高，热情蓬勃，干劲冲天。全省县以上的工业企业，已达到七百余个，职工人数达到三十三万余人，工业总产值达到三亿元以上，较之解放时的十五个手工工厂，一千多个职工，四百万元产值，都增长了数十倍。粮食产量也由1949年的不到六亿斤，增加至二十二亿斤，各种牲畜总头数，由七百多万头，增至一千二百多万头。许多荒无人烟的草原荒滩上，建立起一座座的城市、工厂，一个个的农场、牧场；昆仑山旁，祁连山巅，长江之滨，黄河两岸，以及广漠的草原上，公路四通八达；成百成千的地质勘探人员，正以“钻透戈壁千层土，踏遍昆仑万重山”的英雄气概，向大地探宝；无数英雄儿女，用自己的双手，开垦了千年的处女地，种植了粮食、蔬菜；数万铁路员工，正以“让高山低头、河水让路”的精神，和峻岭、江河、冻土、沙滩展开顽强的战斗，决心早日把铁路修到柴达木盆地和西藏高原，把青海无数宝藏运往祖国各地，把各地的各种工业设备、农牧机械再运到青海广大地区的工厂农场、牧场和人民公社。
    这些成绩，都是在中央和毛主席的英明领导下取得的；是在全国各地的积极帮助、热情支援下取得的。青海的数十万职工，来自祖国各地；青海的每一台机器、每一吨钢材、每一件大型农具，也都来自祖国各地。大跃进以来，各兄弟省、市、自治区更运来了大量物资，代我们制造了大量设备，帮助我们培训了大批职工，也派来了大批技术力量，包括数万名铁路职工，十几万青年踊跃到青海来参加建设。今年，河南省还将有数万青年垦荒队员自带小农具来青海垦荒和参加建设事业。对这些，我们表示衷心的感谢。但是，要彻底改变青海面貌，把青海建设起来，要把各种地下、地上资源开发出来，为祖国社会主义建设发挥作用，除主要依靠青海二百余万各族群众的努力外，我们也衷心希望各兄弟省、市、自治区继续给我们大力支援，特别是劳力和技术的支援。青海，没有人口的大量移入，没有劳动力的大量增加，是不可能更快、更好地建设起来的。因此，我们热烈欢迎各地青年朋友们参加青海建设，不论是男的或女的，工人或农民，青年学生或技术人员。
    让我们一起在祖国的这块刚开发的处女地上，建设起人间的乐园吧！
