    Lakeside of Guanting Lake
    Wang Shushun
    The spring snow had just passed, and the sun was warm. In order to solve some problems in preparing for the construction of a steel plant, five of us came together to an iron smelting plant on the shore of Guanting Lake.

    More than four months ago, during the days of the nationwide mass steel production campaign, I had been here. At that time, the county committee had just decided to establish a joint steel enterprise on this land. Two large fir trees were erected, and a piece of wood was found, planed, and the factory name written on it, which was considered the establishment of the enterprise. But production was ahead of everything else, with dozens of indigenous blast furnaces and dozens of coke ovens spewing flames day and night...

    Now, when I came here again, everything had changed except for the two large fir trees that served as gateposts. Several rows of blast furnaces built of gray bricks blocked the way. The bellows were gone, the coke ovens were gone, replaced by water storage tanks, hot blast stoves, large chimneys, and the deafening roar of machinery. We hurried through the blast furnace area and went first to the "Factory Headquarters Building" – this building, affectionately and proudly called by the people, was naturally also a product of these few months. The doors and windows were not yet painted, and only half of the roof was tiled, with the other half still showing the tar paper. However, people had already been working inside for nearly two months.

    As soon as we entered, we met Director Liu. He was wearing an old cotton-padded jacket, unbuttoned, revealing a faded yellow military uniform underneath. He was over forty, but his face was still rosy and fair. If it weren't for the wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes, one would think he was still a lively young man.

    "Aha, you've arrived!" Although we had never met before, he didn't need any introduction, as if he were an old acquaintance with everyone.

    He took us to his office and bedroom. This small room had a bed at one end and a row of chairs at the other, with a three-drawer desk in the middle – serving as both a desk and a conference table. On the wall was a floor plan, densely covered with lines and blocks. We sat down, and he called in Secretary Chen and Zhao, the head of the personnel section, and we started discussing work directly.

    Two hours later, someone suggested going for a walk. We first passed through the ore yard, where a hundred or two people were sitting on the ground, each with a sledgehammer, breaking ore while sweating profusely. We walked through the crowd, constantly being blocked by handcarts.

    I suddenly remembered the dozens of indigenous blast furnaces from last year and asked the director how many were left. As soon as he heard this, he immediately said, "Come on, I'll take you to see them!"

    We went around to the north side of the blast furnaces, and as soon as we turned the corner, we saw five indigenous blast furnaces standing side by side in a pile of slag, squatting there coldly. Director Liu told us that Secretary Chen had specifically left these five indigenous blast furnaces, not allowing them to be demolished: "In the future, when writing the factory history, these five furnaces will be considered the 'first chapter establishing the principles' of our factory!"

    At this time, I realized that the layout of this factory was quite interesting: starting from the north, from this row of five indigenous blast furnaces, looking south, the rows of blast furnaces were getting bigger and bigger. In front of us, the six and a half cubic meter blast furnaces were currently producing iron, and there were as many as thirty or forty of them. Further south, there was a row of thirteen cubic meter blast furnaces with concrete bases, red iron tops, and red bodies. Further south, the concrete foundations for a row of eight thirteen cubic meter blast furnaces had been laid, and people were working hard to build the furnace bodies and the two large chimneys, thirty-two meters high.

    We wound through the group of six and a half cubic meter blast furnaces and came to the foot of the thirteen cubic meter blast furnaces. These furnaces had just been completed and had not yet been put into production. I don't know who took the lead in climbing up the material hopper ladder, and I joined them. As soon as I stood still and turned around, Director Liu had also followed us up.

    It was a rare good day. The heavy snow from a few days ago was almost untraceable in the wilderness. The sky was cloudless, and the warm sun shone directly overhead, as if a light layer of white mist was rising from the fields. To the north, a train roared past, and the white smoke from the locomotive lingered, forming clusters of white flowers in the azure sky. Looking south, Guanting Reservoir shimmered with a dazzling silver light beneath the snow-covered mountains. The air was as fresh as if it had been washed, slightly cool, and penetrating to the heart and lungs.

    We stood for a while, and Director Liu waved his hand, pointing to the station in the distance and saying to us, "This summer, a dedicated line will be built from there, directly to our factory, and then through it, all the way south, connecting the coke oven plant as well." He turned around, pointing to that row of solitary houses on a rolling earth hill with his finger: "That's the preparatory office for the coke oven plant!"

    After he pointed it out, we could see several figures at the foot of the earth hill, fiddling with surveying poles, measuring something.

    Coming down from the blast furnace and heading southwest, crossing an earth slope, Director Liu pointed to a piece of land under our feet and said to us, "This is the site of our steel plant."

    I recognized this piece of land. It was the very same high-yield sorghum field where Old Wang, the driver of the visiting delegation last autumn, got lost and couldn't find his way out.

    I mentioned this incident, and everyone laughed. Director Liu was even more animated, pointing to an earthen road to the north and telling us, "That's the future Dongfeng (East Wind) Avenue!"

    This was an extremely ordinary country lane that could be found anywhere in the northern countryside, less than two meters wide, with deep ruts pressed into the middle by the wheels of carts, and a few patches of snow still remaining on the edges. But, how could one imagine that in the near future, this cart road would become a sixty-meter-wide asphalt road!

    Going west along Dongfeng Avenue, outside the future west wall of the steel plant, would be the well-known Industrial Avenue, exactly sixty meters wide. Further west would be the future machinery manufacturing plant, the future automobile and tractor plant, the future... Director Liu bent down, squinting his eyes, pointing to that cluster of earthen houses in the distance and saying, "Over there, construction of workers' dormitories will begin, all three-story buildings. In the future, this whole area will be connected, forming an industrial city with a population of two hundred thousand!"

    At this moment, the floor plan on the wall of the director's office suddenly flashed in my mind. All the densely packed lines and blocks on the plan jumped up in an instant, displaying colorful brilliance.

    We stood on this piece of land, and no one spoke for a long time. One could guess that everyone's mind was churning with the beautiful scenery of the future.

    We happily concluded this visit. On the way back, as the car passed Guanting Reservoir, the lake water rippled outside the window, and patches of ice and snow remained near the shore. I recalled the scene when Guanting Reservoir was built a few years ago. At that time, we were only thinking of building the reservoir as soon as possible to tame the Yongding River, which had been causing harm for hundreds of years. Who could have imagined that a joint steel enterprise would be built beside it a few years later? And, moreover, an industrial city with a population of hundreds of thousands would soon appear!

    官厅湖畔
    王树舜
    春雪乍过，阳光和煦。为了解决筹建钢厂的几个问题，我们一起五个人来到了官厅湖畔的一座炼铁厂。
    四个多月以前，在全民大搞钢铁生产的日子里，我到过这儿。那时，县委刚刚确定在这片土地上建立一个钢铁联合企业，两根大杉竖了起来，找来一块木板刨了刨，写上厂名，就算是立起了门户。但是生产却走在前面，几十座土高炉和几十座炼焦炉，日夜喷吐着火光……
    现在当我重新来到这儿的时候，除了那两根作为门柱的大杉没有变动以外，一切全改了模样。几排灰砖砌起的高炉挡住了去路，风箱不见了，炼焦炉不见了，代替它们的是蓄水池、热风炉、大烟囱，还有震耳欲聋的机器轰隆声。我们匆匆穿过高炉群，先去“厂部大楼”——这座被人们亲切而又自豪地喊着的大楼，自然也是这几个月里的产物，门窗还没油漆，屋顶上只有一半挂上了瓦，那一半还露着油毡，然而，人们已经在里面工作了近两个月了。
    一进门，就碰见了刘厂长。他穿了身旧棉袄，开着扣，里面露着褪了色的黄军装，四十开外了，脸上仍然白里透红，若不是脑门上、眼角边的那几条皱纹，别人还会以为他还是个欢蹦乱跳的小伙子呢。
    “啊哈，你们可来了！”虽然我们从来没见过面，他却用不着介绍，就像跟每个人都是老相识一样。
    他把我们带到他的办公室兼卧室。这间不大的房子，一头放床，一头放一排椅子，当中摆了张三屉桌——又算是办公桌，又算是会议桌。墙上贴了张什么平面图，密密麻麻地画满了条条和块块。我们坐下来，他喊来了陈书记和人事科的赵科长，直接谈开了工作。
    两个钟头过后，有人提议出去走走。我们先经过矿石场，一两百人正坐在地上，每人一把鎯头，汗流满面地砸矿石。我们从人丛中穿过，不时被手推车挡住。
    我忽然想起去年那几十座土高炉，就问厂长还剩下几个没有，他一听这个，马上说：“走，我带你们看去！”
    我们绕到高炉北面，刚一拐弯，一眼就看见在一堆炉渣当中，并排立着五个土高炉，冷清清地蹲在那里。刘厂长告诉我们，这五个土高炉是陈书记特意留下来的，没让拆：“将来，写厂史的时候，这五个炉子就算是咱们厂的‘开宗明义第一章’！”
    这时，我才发现，这个厂子的布局是满有意思的：打北面起，从这一排五个土高炉开始，往南看去，一排排高炉，一起比一起高大。眼前，正在出铁的是六个半立公尺的高炉子，这一群足有三、四十座；往南，是一排混凝土座、红铁顶、红身子的十三立公尺的高炉；再往南，一排八个十三立公尺高炉的混凝土底座已经打好，人们正紧张地砌炉身和那两个高三十二公尺的大烟囱。
    我们在六个半立公尺高炉群里绕了几个弯，来到了十三立公尺高炉脚下。这几个炉子刚刚建成，还未投入生产。也不知是谁带头顺着料罐梯子往上爬，我也夹在中间爬上去。刚刚站定，一回头，刘厂长也跟着上来了。
    这是个难得的好天气。前些天那场大雪，在旷野里几乎找不到踪迹了。万里无云，暖洋洋的阳光当头直晒下来，田野里仿佛腾起了淡淡的一层白雾。北面，一列火车吼叫着开过去，机车喷出的白烟久久没有消失，在蔚蓝色的天空里镶起了团团白色的花朵。朝南望，白雪皑皑的山头下，官厅水库泛起一片耀眼的银光。空气像水洗过一样的清鲜，丝丝微凉，渗人心肺。
    我们站了一回儿，刘厂长把手一挥，指着远处的车站对我们说：“今年夏天，就要从那里修一条专用线，直通到咱们厂子来，然后再穿过去，一直往南，把炼焦厂也连上。”他掉过身，用手指着一片起伏的土岗上那排孤零零的房子：“那就是炼焦厂筹备处！”
    经他这一指，我们才看出来，土岗脚下有几个人影，正摆弄着标杆，在测量什么。
    从高炉下来，往西南去，越过一个土坡，刘厂长指着脚下一片土地，对我们说：“这就是咱们炼钢厂的厂址。”
    我认识这块地，这正是去年秋天参观团司机老王在里面迷了路走不出来的那块高粱丰产田。
    我提起这件事，所有的人都笑了。刘厂长更是活跃，他指着北边一条土路告诉我们：“那就是未来的东风大街！”
    这是条北方农村哪里都可以找到的极普通的乡间大车道，宽不到两公尺、中间两道车轮压成的深沟，几片积雪还残留在沟边。但是，怎么能想像出，不久的将来，这条大车道竟会变成六十公尺宽的柏油马路！
    顺着东风大街往西去，在未来的钢铁厂西墙外，就是这里任人皆知的工业大街，不折不扣，也是六十公尺宽。再往西，就是未来的机械制造厂，未来的汽车拖拉机厂，未来的……刘厂长躬下身，迷细着眼睛，指着远处那一片土房子说：“那边，就要动工兴建工人宿舍，全是三层楼。将来，这一片连起来，就是一个二十万人口的工业城市！”
    这时，我脑子里忽然闪过厂长办公室墙上的那张平面图，图上的那些密密麻麻的条条和块块一刹那间都跳跃起来，呈现出五颜六色的光彩。
    我们站在这片土地上，好久没有人说话。可以猜想得到，每个人的脑海里都在翻动着那未来美景。
    我们愉快地结束了这次访问。回来的路上，车过官厅水库，窗外湖水微波，近岸处还残留着片片冰雪。我回忆起几年前修建官厅水库时的情景。当时我们想的只是早些修好水库，治服这条为害几百年的永定河。谁能料到几年之后，在它身边会建起一座钢铁联合企业？而且，而且不久之后便会出现一座几十万人口的工业城市！
