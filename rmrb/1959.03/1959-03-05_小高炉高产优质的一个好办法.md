One of the important reasons why the output and quality of pig iron have not been improved in many local small blast furnaces is that the wind temperature of the tubular hot blast stove used is generally only between 300 and 500 degrees. Recently, the Dongsihe Iron Smelting Plant in Pingshan County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, promoted the experience of segmented multi-nozzle combustion from the Renmin Iron Plant in You County, Hunan Province, which resulted in a doubling of output, a reduction of about 500 kg of coke consumption per ton of pig iron, and a sulfur content of pig iron of less than 0.2%. In the past, this plant only had two combustion nozzles on each hot blast stove, and the wind temperature was generally only 420 degrees, resulting in low output, high coke ratio, and poor quality of the blast furnace. In order to change this situation, the factory party committee promoted the experience of the Renmin Iron Plant in You County. First, the number of combustion nozzles on the hot blast stove of the No. 7 small blast furnace was increased to twelve in the front and on both sides, thereby expanding the range of gas combustion. The wind temperature was increased to 730 degrees, and the highest reached 780 degrees. Unprecedented new situations emerged in pig iron production, quality, and coke unit consumption.

The characteristic of this method is segmented multi-nozzle combustion, and the modification process is simple and easy to implement. According to the experience of You County and Pingshan County, although the hot air temperature is increased, the life of the hot air pipe is not affected because the combustion in the furnace is evenly heated. After adopting this method, the gas consumption of the hot blast stove increases, so corresponding measures must be taken to increase the gas supply. (Metallurgical Technology)

    小高炉高产优质的一个好办法
    目前，许多地方小高炉使用的管式热风炉风温一般在三百至五百度，这是生铁产量和质量未能改善的重要原因之一。最近，河北石家庄专区平山县东四舍炼铁厂推广了湖南攸县人民铁厂分段多风咀燃烧的经验，使产量猛增一倍，每吨生铁的焦炭消耗降低五百公斤左右，生铁含硫量也达到0.2％以下。这个厂过去每个热风炉上只有两个燃烧咀，风温一般只四百二十度，因之，高炉一直是产量低、焦比高、质量差。工厂党委为了改变这种状况，推广了湖南攸县人民铁厂的经验，首先在第七号小高炉的热风炉前和两侧把燃烧咀增加到十二个，因而扩大了煤气燃烧的范围，风温提高到七百三十度，最高曾达到七百八十度，生铁产量、质量和焦炭单位消耗都出现了从未有过的新局面。
    这个方法的特点是分段多风咀燃烧，改装过程简单易行。根据攸县和平山县的经验，热风温度虽然提高，但由于炉内燃烧受热均匀，热风管的寿命并没有影响，采用这个方法后，热风炉的煤气消耗增多，因此必须相应地采取一些措施增加煤气的供应量。　（冶技）
