    Castor Bean - The Darling of Future Economic Crops
    Zhi Wei

    Castor beans have not been highly valued in the past. Usually, people only know that its oil can be taken as a laxative and used as printing ink oil.

    However, with the progress of science, people have discovered that the entire castor bean plant is a treasure. Now it is an important economic crop, and in the near future, it may become the darling of economic crops.

    The castor bean originated in Africa and later migrated to India and various parts of Eurasia. It can be planted in tropical and subtropical, temperate, and even as far north as Northeast China. However, those grown in the tropics have tall branches and large leaves like trees, are perennial, and bloom and bear seeds every year. In other places, however, they must be planted every year. Planting generally takes place in April and May, and harvesting in October. The castor bean has a strong vitality. It can grow in fields, corners of houses, barren hillsides, and even saline-alkali land. Once a seed is planted, it grows vigorously without special care, often causing the surrounding weeds to die because its leaves block the sun.

    What are the uses of castor beans?

    Castor silk woven fabrics are now very familiar and loved by people. However, it was only in recent years that the castor silkworm was brought from India to China and successfully cultivated. The castor silkworm eats the leaves of the castor bean. Its life cycle is short, only fourteen or fifteen days. During the growing season of the castor bean, it can be fed eight to ten times. It also has a strong vitality and rarely gets sick. While raising silkworms to obtain silk, there are also many other benefits: castor silkworm droppings (feces) can fertilize the fields. Silkworm pupae can be used to extract oil for food or industrial use, containing about the same amount of protein as meat or eggs. They can be stir-fried directly or made into tofu, which is rich in nutrition. They can also be used to feed livestock.

    The stem of the castor bean, after processing, can also be used to obtain fiber for making ropes or artificial cotton.

    But the more important use lies in castor seeds and castor oil. The mottled seeds contain up to 50% oil based solely on the seed kernel. However, because castor oil contains ricin, which is poisonous, it cannot be used as general edible oil.

    Castor oil is not easy to freeze, dry, or solidify, has high viscosity, and its viscosity does not change much even when the temperature rises or falls. It also has very low acidity. Therefore, in addition to being used as medicine, printing ink oil, and paint, it is also used as a lubricant in the aviation industry. Castor oil, after sulfonation, becomes Turkey red oil, which is indispensable in the textile printing and dyeing industry.

    It is the chemists who have made castor oil shine.

    People have discovered that heating castor oil at high temperatures yields undecylenic acid. Undecylenic acid, after processing, yields aminoundecanoic acid. Heating castor oil with alkali yields sebacic acid.

    Aminoundecanoic acid, after polycondensation, is nylon 11; different types of nylon, such as nylon 610, can also be obtained from sebacic acid.

    Two to three kilograms, or perhaps a little more, of castor oil can produce one kilogram of nylon. A pair of nylon socks weighs only seven qian (35 grams), but it is four to five times more durable than ordinary socks. Perhaps one day people will consider whether it is more worthwhile to grow cotton or castor beans.

    At the same time as obtaining undecylenic acid, heptanal is also obtained. The phenolic resin made from heptanal and carbolic acid has better properties than phenolic formaldehyde resin and can also be reduced to heptanol for use as a plasticizer for large-scale production of polyvinyl chloride. When making sebacic acid, glycerol and isooctyl alcohol are obtained, the latter of which can also be used as a plasticizer.

    Not only that, sebacic acid is also used as a raw material for special plastics and fragrances.

    If different methods are used, nearly twenty kinds of products can be obtained directly or indirectly from castor oil, and even more products can be obtained from them, with different uses.

    These applications of castor beans are no longer laboratory experiments, but large-scale applications in production. Therefore, people are paying more and more attention to castor beans. China is a country suitable for and with a tradition of growing castor beans, and the planting and utilization of castor beans will become more and more widespread.

    蓖麻——未来经济作物中的宠儿
    志伟
    蓖麻一向不大被人重视。通常，大家只知道它的油吃了可以泻肚子，和可以作为印泥油。
    但是，随着科学的进步，人们发现，蓖麻混身都是宝，现在它已是重要的经济作物，不久的将来，它也许会跃为经济作物中的宠儿。
    蓖麻原籍非洲，后来才迁居印度及欧亚各地的，凡是热带和亚热带、温带甚至北到我国东北都能种植。不过，生在热带的枝高叶大如树，多年生，年年开花结籽。而其他地方却要年年栽种。种植一般都在4、5月，到了10月便收获了。蓖麻的生活力很强，田边、屋角、荒山坡，甚至盐碱地都能生长，一粒下地，无需特别的照顾便泼辣辣地长起来，往往因为它的叶子遮住了太阳而使周围的野草死去。
    蓖麻有些什么用处呢？
    蓖麻蚕丝织的绸子，现在已经很为人们熟悉喜爱了。但把蓖麻蚕从印度请到中国来，培育成功，还只是近几年的事。蓖麻蚕吃的，便是蓖麻的叶子。它的生活周期短，只有十四、五天，在蓖麻的生长期内，可以喂八到十次之多，生活力也很强，很少得病。在喂蚕取得蚕丝的同时，还有许多其他的收益：蓖麻蚕沙（粪便）可以肥田。蚕蛹可以榨油食用或工业用，含的蛋白质和肉或鸡蛋差不多，可以直接炒了吃或做成豆腐，营养丰富。也可用来饲养家畜。
    蓖麻的茎，经过处理，还可以得到纤维，作绳子，也可作人造棉。
    但更重要的用途在于蓖麻籽与蓖麻油。花色斑驳的籽，单以籽仁计含油高达50％。但因为蓖麻油中含有蓖麻素，有毒，所以不能作为一般食用。
    蓖麻油不易冻、干、固结，粘度高，温度虽升降粘度改变也不大，酸度很低，因此，它除了被用作医药、印泥油和油漆外，还被用作航空工业中的润滑油。蓖麻油经过磺化，就成为土耳其红油，是纺织印染工业不可少的。
    使得蓖麻油大显身手的，是化学家。
    人们发现，用高温把蓖麻油加热时，得到了十一烯酸。十一烯酸经过处理，得到了氨基十一酸。蓖麻油加上碱加热时，得到的是癸二酸。
    氨基十一酸经过缩聚是尼龙11；从癸二酸出发也能得到不同种类的尼龙，如尼龙610等。
    由三到五斤或许稍多一点的蓖麻油，就能制出一公斤尼龙。一双尼龙袜子只有七钱重，却比普通袜子耐穿四、五倍。也许，有一天人们会考虑是种棉花上算或种蓖麻上算。
    在得到十一烯酸的同时，还得到了庚醛。庚醛和石碳酸作出的酚醛塑料，有的性能比酚甲醛塑料还好，也能还原为庚醇，用作大规模生产的聚氯乙烯的增塑剂。在作癸二酸时，得到的是甘油与异辛醇，后者也能作为增塑剂。
    不只这些，癸二酸还作为特种塑料和香料的原料。
    如果使用的方法不同，从蓖麻油还足足能直接、间接得到近二十种产品，从它们又能得到更多的产品，而用途各异。
    蓖麻的这些运用，已不是实验室中的试验，而已是生产中大规模的运用了。因此，人们对蓖麻愈来愈重视。我国是一个宜于和有传统的种蓖麻的国家，种植和利用蓖麻也将愈来愈广泛。
