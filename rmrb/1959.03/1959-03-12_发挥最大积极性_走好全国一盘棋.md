Summary of local newspaper commentary:

    Maximize Enthusiasm, Coordinate Efforts Nationally
    "Aid" and "Yield" Both Start from the Big Picture
    The core of the national coordination is ensuring the priorities. Currently, the development of China's raw materials industry cannot keep up with the needs of the processing industry, which is a fundamental contradiction. Therefore, we must take steel as the key link and resolutely complete the four major targets. The machinery and electronics industry consumes the most steel among the processing industries. Without a leap in steel production, there can be no significant development in the machinery and electronics industry. To drastically increase steel production, many mining, coal washing, coking, and steel rolling equipment are needed. The machinery and electronics industry must "aid," devoting all efforts to manufacture this equipment; manufacturing mining equipment requires a large amount of steel materials, and the machinery and electronics industry needs to "yield," prioritizing the raw materials for manufacturing these equipment. By doing so, the priorities are ensured, the overall situation is taken care of, and the leapfrog development of the entire national economy is promoted, which also creates favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in the machinery and electronics industry. Moreover, in the process of supporting the four major targets, the machinery and electronics industry itself can also leap forward rapidly. During last year's steel production battle, the Tianjin machinery and electronics industry concentrated its efforts on rushing to produce smelting equipment, enabling production to leap forward again and again, and improving its technical level. This is a clear example. Whether it is "aid" or "yield," both start from the overall situation and require the highest level of enthusiasm.

    Distinguish Priorities, Ensure Key Areas
    Coordinating efforts nationally and ensuring key areas is our Party's consistent policy in leading China's revolution and economic construction. It embodies the objective law of planned and proportionate development of China's socialist economy, and it stipulates the correct relationship between the whole and the part, the big picture and the small picture, the key areas and the general areas, and the state and the localities. To implement the policy of coordinating efforts nationally, the fundamental issue is that we must use a national, holistic, and priority-oriented perspective to deal with problems in production; every one of our enterprises, down to every workshop, group, and individual, should have a global perspective in planning and organizing production activities, starting from the overall interests and doing everything possible to make their local area contribute to the victory of the overall situation to the greatest extent. Whether the idea of "coordinating efforts nationally" is sufficient is a sign of whether every enterprise puts politics in command, and a sign of the strength of every Communist Party member's party spirit.
    Will resolutely implementing the policy of coordinating efforts nationally affect the enthusiasm of local areas and parts? The answer is definitely no. Our socialist economy is an inseparable whole, and the production of each of our factories is a part of national production, carried out under the unified national plan. Our enthusiasm is to summon up soaring energy, maximize subjective initiative, comprehensively overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state, and do our utmost to achieve eighteen million tons of steel. It can be completely determined that ensuring the priorities and distinguishing the primary and secondary are positive measures, not negative ones, and they are necessary measures for achieving a greater leap forward.
    (Excerpt from Dalian Daily Editorial: "Make Greater and Better Contributions to the Victory of National Coordination")
    One Heart from Top to Bottom, One Account at All Levels
    According to the unified plan, first ensuring the completion of this year's production and construction tasks requires emphasizing "coordinating efforts nationally," one heart from top to bottom, one account at all levels, and the communist spirit of subordinating the small picture to the big picture and the local to the whole. "Coordinating efforts nationally" means unified national planning for basic construction; unified national planning for the production of major products; unified national planning for the distribution of raw materials and the two categories (means of production and means of subsistence); in addition, priorities must be ranked in order to ensure the needs of key areas and major aspects of economic development and economic life. One heart from top to bottom means unified thinking. What to do first, what to do later, how much to do first, how much to do later, all the division of labor posts must achieve ideological unity, go up when it is time to go up, and go down when it is time to go down. One account at all levels means obeying the unified plan, and incorporating their own manpower, material resources, and financial resources into the entire plan. Implementing the deployment of "coordinating efforts nationally" is a particularly important issue in economic work, and it is the fundamental guarantee for organizing a greater leap forward. To ensure the realization of this year's leap forward plan, it is necessary to implement "coordinating efforts nationally," concentrate forces, and ensure the priorities. Taking factory basic construction as an example, whether key projects can be quickly completed and put into production not only affects the overall situation, but also has a great impact on various departments. Only by first ensuring the key projects can other projects be guaranteed accordingly. The relationship between key and general in other work is also the same. We must comprehensively arrange the national economic plan by distinguishing between primary and secondary, priority and sequence, importance and urgency, and consciously obey it. This is precisely what is necessary for the high-speed development of the national economy. It must be seen that if the big picture cannot be protected, the small picture will certainly not be reliable, and failure to take care of the big picture and not understanding the overall situation will lead to errors of departmentalism and decentralism. It is very clear that if the priorities are not distinguished and everything is advanced simultaneously, it will inevitably disperse forces, failing to guarantee the priorities and failing to take care of the general, inevitably affecting the completion of the entire plan. Therefore, all work in 1959, whether production, infrastructure construction, or other aspects, should be based on the spirit of "coordinating efforts nationally," and should be comprehensively and properly arranged according to the principle of first the central government, then the local government. After the comprehensive arrangement, resolute action must be taken to implement this arrangement. What should be done if the comprehensively arranged plan is inconsistent with one's own ideas or one's own existing deployments? One should willingly give up one's own ideas and deployments, and re-mobilize and re-arrange according to the instructions of the higher authorities. As long as the reasons are explained to the broad masses of workers and the role of this change is clarified, the enthusiasm of the masses will be even higher.
    (Excerpt from Yangtze Daily Editorial: "Recognize the Overall Situation, Take Care of the Overall Interests, and Resolutely Implement the Policy of 'Coordinating Efforts Nationally'")
    Initiative Under the National Plan
    Will implementing "coordinating efforts nationally" affect enthusiasm? The answer is no. According to the view of the interrelationship of things, the overall situation is composed of parts, and the part belongs to the overall situation. The national plan considers the enthusiasm and flexibility of both the overall situation and the parts in a unified way. At the same time, it is also necessary to see what kind of enthusiasm it is, and on what basis it is built. If it can be based on the Party's general line, according to the principle of "coordinating efforts nationally"; starting from the whole, combining the unified national plan with the actual situation of the unit, trying every means to create conditions, and completing the tasks assigned by the state, this kind of enthusiasm should be greatly promoted. On the contrary, "enthusiasm" that violates the principle of "coordinating efforts nationally," disregarding the overall situation, and disregarding the overall interests must be avoided and overcome. In complex economic construction, due to the limitations of people's subjective understanding of the objective, any plan can only reflect the main aspects of objective economic life and cannot be all-encompassing. In addition, the objective is constantly developing, and new situations and unexpected problems will inevitably arise. Therefore, each unit must maximize its initiative to better implement the national plan, but this initiative must be exercised under the unified national plan and must not be separated from the unity.

### 发挥最大积极性　走好全国一盘棋

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    发挥最大积极性　走好全国一盘棋
    “援”和“让”都从全局出发
    全国一盘棋的中心是保证重点。当前我国原材料工业的发展，赶不上加工工业的需要，这是一个基本的矛盾。因此，我们要以钢为纲，坚决完成四大指标。机电工业是耗用钢铁最多的加工工业，钢铁生产不跃上去，机电工业就不可能有很大的发展。为了急剧增加钢铁产量，需要许多采矿、洗煤、炼焦、轧钢等设备，机电工业就要“援”，全力来制造这些设备；制造采矿等设备需要大量的钢铁材料，机电工业又需要“让”，把一些一般产品的原材料首先用来满足制造这些设备的需要。这样做，保证了重点，照顾了全局，促进整个国民经济的飞跃发展，也为机电工业的更大跃进创造了有利条件。而且支援四大指标的过程中，机电工业本身也可以迅速地跃上去。去年夺钢大战中，天津市机电工业集中力量赶制冶炼设备，使生产一跃再跃，并且提高了技术水平，就是明显的例证。无论是“援”或者是“让”，都是从全局出发，都需要发挥最高的积极性。
    （摘自天津日报社论：“发挥最高积极性，走胜全国一盘棋”）
    分清主次　确保重点
    全国一盘棋，保证重点，是我们党领导我国革命和经济建设事业的一贯方针。它体现着我国社会主义经济有计划按比例发展的客观法则，它规定了整体和局部、大局和小局、重点和一般、国家与地方的正确关系。贯彻执行全国一盘棋的方针，根本的问题就是要我们用面向全国、面向整体、面向重点的观点，来处理生产中的问题；我们的每一个企业，直到每一个车间、小组和个人，在安排计划和组织生产业务活动中，都应该有一个全局的观念，从总体利益出发，尽一切力量，使自己这个局部能够为全局的胜利作出最大限度的贡献。“全国一盘棋”的思想够不够，是考验每一个企业是否政治挂帅的一个标志，是考验每一个共产党员党性强弱的一个标志。
    坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针会不会影响地方、局部的积极性呢？肯定是不会的。我们的社会主义经济是一个不可分割的整体，我们每个工厂的生产都是国家生产的一部分，都是在国家统一计划下进行的。我们的积极性就是鼓起冲天干劲，最大限度地发挥主观能动作用，全面超额完成国家分配给我们的任务，为实现一千八百万吨钢尽自己的最大的努力。完全可以断定，确保重点，分清主次，是积极的措施，不是消极的，它是为实现更大跃进的必要措施。
      （摘自旅大日报社论：“为全国一盘棋的胜利作出更大更好的贡献”）
    上下一条心　各级一本账
    按照统一的计划，首先保证完成今年生产、建设的计划任务，必须强调“全国一盘棋”，上下一条心，各级一本账，小局服从大局，局部服从整体的共产主义精神。“全国一盘棋”就是全国统一安排基本建设；全国统一安排主要产品的生产；全国统一安排原材料和两个部类（生产资料和生活资料）主要物资的分配；此外，就是轻重缓急要加以排队，以确保重点，保证经济发展和经济生活中主要方面的需要。上下一条心，就是想法一致。先干什么，后干什么，先搞多少，后搞多少，彼此分工的岗位都要在思想上取得一致，该上就上，该下就下。各级一本账，就是服从统一的计划，各自的人力物力财力，都纳入整个计划。执行“全国一盘棋”的部署，是经济工作一个特别重要的问题，它是组织更大跃进的根本保证。要保证今年跃进计划的实现，必须贯彻“全国一盘棋”，集中力量，保证重点。以工厂基本建设来说，重点工程能否迅速建成和投入生产，不仅关系到全局，同时对各个部门也影响很大。只有首先保证了重点工程，才能使其他各项工程得到相应的保证。其他工作上重点和一般的关系也是如此。我们必须分别主从、先后、轻重、缓急来统筹安排国民经济计划，并自觉地服从它。这正是高速度发展国民经济所必需的。必须看到，大局保不住，小局也一定靠不住，不照顾大局，不识大体就要犯本位主义、分散主义的错误。很明显，如果轻重不分，齐头并进，势必分散力量，既不能保证重点，又不能照顾一般，必然影响整个计划的完成。因此，1959年的一切工作无论生产、基建和其他各方面的工作都应该根据
  “全国一盘棋”的精神，按照先中央，后地方的原则，加以统筹，全面和妥善的安排。在统筹安排之后，就要以坚决的行动，来执行这一安排。统筹安排的计划，凡和自己想法不一致，和自己已有的部署不一致，应该怎样办呢？应该心甘情愿地舍得放弃自己的想法和部署，遵照上级的指示重新动员，重新安排。只要向广大职工说明道理讲清这种改变的作用，群众的干劲就会更高。
      （摘自长江日报社论“识大体、顾大局、坚决贯彻‘全国一盘棋’的方针”）
    国家计划下的主动性
    实行“全国一盘棋”会不会影响积极性？答复是不会的。根据事物相互联系的观点，全局是由局部构成的，局部属于全局之中，全国的计划，是把全局和局部的积极性、机动性统一起来考虑的。同时，也要看到是什么样的积极性，建立在什么基础上，若是能依照党的总路线，根据“全国一盘棋”的原则；从整体出发，把国家统一计划和本单位实际情况结合起来，千方百计，创造条件，完成国家分配的任务，这种积极性应该大大发扬。反之，违背“全国一盘棋”的原则，不顾大局，不顾大体的“积极性”，必须加以避免和克服。在复杂的经济建设中，由于人们主观对客观认识的局限性，任何一个计划只能反映出客观经济生活中主要的诸方面，不可能面面俱到。加以客观又是在不断向前发展的，必然会出现新的情况和料想不到的问题，因此，也就要由各单位最大限度地发挥主动性，来更好地执行国家计划，但是这种主动性，必须在国家统一计划下发挥，决不能脱离统一。
