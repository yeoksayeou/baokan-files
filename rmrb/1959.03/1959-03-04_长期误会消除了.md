    Longstanding Misunderstanding Cleared Up

    Wu Shuying is a female commune member of the Fifteenth Brigade of the Ting'an Commune in Jiangsu. Her family of five includes three children, the oldest only five or six years old, and the youngest still learning to walk. Before the communization, she was burdened by her children and housework, spending her days in the kitchen and turning the stove. The housework exhausted her, making it difficult to dedicate more time to production. Some people, not understanding her difficulties, mistakenly believed she participated in labor less, giving her the nickname "Lazy Woman." It is understandable that she felt distressed in this situation. She often said, "Others have their parents-in-law to help, or sisters-in-law to assist; no one's life is as hard as Wu Shuying's."

    After communization, this long-standing puzzle was finally solved. Wu Shuying, consistently referred to by some as a "Lazy Woman," unexpectedly became extraordinarily diligent and thrifty. In just three months, the work points she earned exceeded more than double her total work points from last year. She not only attends work frequently but also often ranks at the forefront, receiving praise from the production team leaders on numerous occasions. She often says, "Now things are good, I feel lighter, my mind and body are happy, and I feel more motivated to work!"

    长期误会消除了
    吴淑英，是江苏汀安公社十五大队的女社员。她一家五口，三个孩子，大的只有五、六岁，小的还在乖乖地学跑。在公社化之前，她被孩子和家务牵累，成天守厨房、转锅台。家务事，累得她喘不过气来，很难抽出更多的时间从事生产。有些人不了解她的难处，误认为她参加劳动少，给她一个“女懒汉”的绰号。身处这种境地，其内心的苦闷是可以理解的。她常说：“人家不是有公婆照应，就是有妯娌相帮，再苦也不及我吴淑英。”
    公社化以后，这个长期猜不破的谜终究被揭开了。一贯被有些人称之谓“女懒汉”的吴淑英，出人意料之外地变得格外勤俭非凡。在短短的三个月中，所做的工分竟超过了她去年工分总和的一倍以上。她不仅经常出勤，而且往往名列前茅，曾多次得到生产队领导上的表扬。她常说：“现在好啦，身轻了，身心挺愉快，越干越来劲！”
