To Promote a Bigger, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward This Year
Guangdong and Shandong Convene Meetings to Discuss Implementing the Sixth Plenary Session Resolution

    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, March 3rd dispatch) The Third Session of the First Guangdong Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which recently closed, was a conference that resolutely implemented the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and a mobilization rally to encourage efforts to strive for advancement.
    Based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the recent instructions from the Central Committee, this conference summarized the great achievements and successful experiences of implementing the Party's General Line last year, and mobilized and organized the people of the entire province to strive for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year with even more high-spirited fighting spirit and drive. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting on "Achieving a Greater Leap Forward This Year." During the conference, Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Lin Biao, who were inspecting work in Guangdong, attended the conference to meet the representatives. Comrade Zhu De also spoke at the conference, encouraging the Guangdong Party organization to strive for advancement. The cordial concern and guidance of the responsible comrades of the Central Committee gave the comrades present great encouragement and impetus.
    The Guangdong Provincial Party Congress unanimously held that high-speed development is the objective law of socialist construction in our country; the subjective dynamic role of the Party and the masses of the people is the most essential, most active, and most decisive factor in the high-speed development of socialist construction. This is not only because our country is a socialist system, because the exploitation of classes has been eliminated, and the working people have become the masters of society; because labor is for building a happy new society and for continuously improving one's own life; because social accumulation for expanded reproduction can be continuously increased under the premise of gradually improving the people's lives; and because the contradiction between productive forces and production relations can be adjusted in a timely manner through internal methods, thus the economic development of socialism must be unprecedented and high-speed. It is also especially because our country was poor and blank, and the liberated people have the strongest desire, the most determined will, and revolutionary drive to rapidly change this backward situation. As long as the objective allows doing ten points, they will never only do nine points nine. People who have exerted soaring drive can overcome unimaginable difficulties, can achieve the fastest construction speed, and can achieve miracle-like victories.
    On the basis of raising awareness and boosting morale, the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress adopted the guideline of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, with agriculture as the main focus, in this year's production; and the guideline of giving equal importance to grain production and diversified operations, with grain as the main focus, in this year's agricultural production. Then, it adopted the specific leap forward plans for industrial and agricultural production this year. In terms of agricultural production, this year's grain production must increase by more than 60% on the basis of last year's more than doubled increase compared to the previous year, to ensure that the grain problem is ultimately and thoroughly solved this year. All other agricultural production projects are required to have an increase of more than half or even several times. It is required that while grain passes the test, sugar, sugarcane, oil, fruits, vegetables, mulberry, hemp, tea, and tobacco are all increased in production, and animal husbandry, aquatic products, and forestry all leap forward. All major industrial production projects are required to have a significant increase this year, with special emphasis on the development of the coal industry, striving for self-sufficiency, to ensure that steel production completes the national plan. At the same time, more attention is paid to the production of light industry, and sugar production this year should increase by one to one and a half times.
    The Guangdong Provincial Party Congress unanimously held that the above-mentioned plan is a very high target, a plan that can excite people, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and a plan that is entirely possible to achieve. To achieve this magnificent plan, it is not without difficulties, and the shortage of labor is a prominent problem. The representatives believed that this problem can be completely solved. The conference studied the examples of the Lianyang Coal Mine and the Quren Coal Mine. The Lianyang Coal Mine had 17,000 workers, and without carrying out tool reforms, the daily output of coal was only about 1,500 tons. The Quren Coal Mine had 3,000 people, and after adopting semi-mechanization, the daily output reached more than 1,700 tons. This shows that the potential in industrial production is extremely large, and a great leap forward does not necessarily require recruiting new workers. In agriculture, the conference also cited many examples to show that by relying on the improvement of labor productivity while increasing labor, the leap forward plan can still be achieved. For example, Dabu County has achieved "wheels rolling on the ground, cableways flying in the sky." Last year alone, tool reform saved more than 100 million labor days, increasing the labor productivity of each worker in the county by nearly two times.
    The representatives unanimously believed that improving labor productivity is the fundamental way to achieve this year's leap forward target. Therefore, the Party Congress resolved that large-scale agricultural tool reforms should be carried out in agriculture, and a major technical revolution should be carried out in industry. Labor productivity in both industry and agriculture should be increased by one to two times, and both industry and agriculture should be required to complete the comprehensive leap forward plan without increasing labor.
    The Party Congress studied the national chess game principle with great attention. The representatives believed that in this year's great leap forward, emphasizing starting from the whole country, proceeding from the overall situation, ensuring key points, and rationally using limited manpower, material resources, and financial resources in the most urgent needs, the fastest results, and the most significant roles, will accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country. Therefore, from the relationship between the province and the country, the entire province must obey the country, and all work should be arranged under the premise of prioritizing the completion of the central tasks. From the relationship between various regions in the province and the entire province, all regions must obey the province and first resolutely ensure the completion of the province's plan. In order to resolutely implement the principle of the national chess game, in addition to ideological education, it was also decided to take measures in organization and systems.
    (Our dispatch) The Third Session of the First Shandong Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held from January 24th to February 5th, summarized the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes last year based on the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and discussed and determined this year's economic plan and various tasks for Shandong Province. The meeting held that since the Second Session of the First Party Congress of Shandong Province, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and due to the resolute implementation of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the entire province's industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings have shown a vigorous and leaping forward situation last year. The meeting discussed and formulated the draft of the National Economic Plan for Shandong Province in 1959 based on the requirements of the national economic plan and the specific conditions of Shandong Province. According to this draft plan, this year's output of steel, iron, coal, grain, and cotton in Shandong Province will have a greater increase than last year, and other construction undertakings will also have corresponding leaps in development.
    Regarding the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes, the meeting pointed out: This is a major political task currently facing the Party organization in Shandong Province, especially a central task in the rural areas. In order to complete this task, the Party organizations at all levels in Shandong have, in accordance with the requirements put forward in the Sixth Plenary Session's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," transferred more than 26,000 cadres (and are prepared to continue to transfer them), led by the First Secretary, mobilizing the entire Party, following the mass line, and carrying out commune rectification work, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of all commune members, fully exert the superiority of the people's communes, and set off a greater, better, and more comprehensive production upsurge.
    The meeting thoroughly criticized the localism, decentralism, and right-leaning opportunism tendencies existing within the Shandong Party organization, and achieved another victory in the struggle between the two roads and two lines.
    The meeting pointed out with full confidence: The great victories achieved in socialist revolution and socialist construction in 1958 have provided more favorable conditions for accelerating socialist construction in Shandong Province. In particular, the announcement of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has pointed out the direction for the Party organization and all the people of Shandong Province. As long as we continue to go all out, aim high, continue to promote the mass line and the spirit of seeking truth from facts, a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward situation will inevitably appear this year. The conference called on all levels of Party organizations and all Party member cadres in the province to strive to improve their communist ideological awareness, enhance the unity of the Party a hundredfold, strictly abide by the Party's organizational principles, resolutely, loyally, and thoroughly implement the Party's guidelines and lines, highly promote the mass line and the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, unite the people of the entire province and strive to accelerate socialist construction.

    促成今年更大更好更全面的跃进
  　广东山东召开会议讨论贯彻六中全会决议
    本报广州3日电　最近闭幕的中共广东省第一届代表大会第三次会议，是一次坚决贯彻中共八届六中全会决议的大会，是鼓足干劲力争上游的誓师大会。
    这一次会议根据八届六中全会精神以及中央最近的指示，总结了去年执行党的总路线的伟大成就和成功经验，并且动员和组织全省人民，以更加昂扬的斗志和干劲，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。中共广东省委第一书记陶铸代表省委在会上作了“实现今年更大的跃进”的报告。会议期间，正在广东视察工作的中共中央副主席朱德同志、林彪同志莅临大会会见代表，朱德同志并在大会上讲话，多方勉励广东党组织力争上游。中央负责同志的亲切关怀和教导，给全体到会同志莫大的鼓舞与策励。
    广东省党代大会一致认为高速度地发展，是我国社会主义建设的客观规律；党和人民群众的主观能动作用是社会主义建设高速度发展中最本质最活跃最具有决定意义的因素。这不仅因为我国是社会主义制度，由于消灭了阶级的剥削，劳动人民已成为社会的主人；由于劳动是为了建成幸福的新社会，是为了不断地改善自己的生活；由于扩大再生产的社会积累可以在逐步改善人民生活的前提下，不断地增加；由于生产力与生产关系的矛盾可以通过内部办法及时调整，因而社会主义的经济发展必然是史无前例的，高速度的。还特别因为我国一穷二白，获得了解放的人民，对于迅速改变这种落后状况具有最强烈的愿望最坚毅的意志和革命干劲。只要客观允许办到十分，他们决不只
  办九分九。发挥了冲天干劲的人们，能够克服想像不到的困难，能够取得最快的建设速度，能够得到奇迹一般的胜利。
    广东省党代大会在提高思想鼓足干劲的基础上，通过了今年生产中工业农业并举、以农业为主的方针；今年农业生产中粮食生产和发展多种经营并举、以粮食为主的方针，接着通过了今年工、农业生产的具体跃进计划。农业生产方面，今年粮食生产必须在去年比前年增产一倍多的基础上，再增产六成多，确保今年最终最彻底地解决粮食问题。其它农业生产项目，都要求有半倍以上以至几倍的增长。要求在粮食过关的同时，糖、甘蔗、油、果、菜、桑、麻、茶、烟一齐增产，畜牧、水产、林业一齐跃进。工业生产各个主要项目，今年都要求有很大增长，其中特别重视煤炭工业的发展，力争自给，以确保钢铁生产完成国家计划。同时，还对轻工业的生产给以更多的注意，今年糖产要增加一倍到一倍半。
    广东省党代大会一致认为上述计划是十分指标，能激动人心，能调动群众积极性的计划，又是完全有可能使之实现的计划。要实现这个雄伟的计划，并不是没有困难，其中劳动力不足是个突出的问题。代表们认为这个问题是完全可以解决的。大会研究了连阳煤矿和曲仁煤矿的例子。连阳煤矿工人一万七千人，没有进行工具改革，日产煤仅一千五百吨左右。曲仁煤矿三千人，采用半机械化以后，日产量达到一千七百多吨。这说明，工业生产中潜力极大，大跃进并不一定非招收新工人不可。农业方面，大会也举出许多例子，说明在增加劳动力的情况下，依靠劳动生产率的提高，一样可以使跃进计划实现。譬如大埔县已实现了“地上车轮滚滚，空上索道飞舞”，去年一年仅工具改革一项就节约劳动日一亿个以上，使全县每个劳动生产率提高近两倍。
    到会代表一致认为提高劳动生产率是实现今年跃进指标的根本办法。因此党代表大会决议：农业方面要大搞农具改革，工业方面要大闹技术革命，工业和农业的劳动生产率都要求提高一倍和一倍以上，工业和农业都要求做到在不增加劳动力的情况下，完成全面跃进计划。
    党代大会以很大注意力研究了全国一盘棋的方针。代表们认为：今年大跃进中，强调从全国着眼，从全局出发，保证重点，把有限的人力、物力和财力合理地使用到最迫切需要，收效最快，作用最大的方面去，将能加快我国社会主义的建设速度。因此，从全省和全国的关系上来说，全省必须服从全国，一切工作都应该在优先保证完成中央任务的前提下进行安排。就省内各地区和全省的关系来说，各地必须服从全省，首先坚决保证完成省的计划。为了坚决执行一盘棋的方针，除了思想教育以外，还决定在组织上、制度上采取措施。
    本报讯　1月24日到2月5日举行的中共山东省第一届代表大会第三次会议，依据中共八届六中全会决议的精神总结了去年大跃进和人民公社化的成就和经验，并讨论和确定了今年山东省的经济计划和各项任务。会议认为，从全省第一届党代表大会第二次会议以来，山东省各级党组织和全省人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，由于坚决地贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，去年全省工农业生产和各项建设事业都出现了蓬勃发展的大跃进的形势。会议依据国家经济计划的要求和山东省的具体情况，讨论和制订了全省1959年国民经济计划草案。根据这个计划草案，今年山东省钢、铁、煤、粮食、棉花的产量都将比去年有更大的增长，其他各项建设事业也都将相应地有飞跃的发展。
    对于人民公社的整顿巩固工作，会议指出：这是山东省党组织当前面临的一项重大政治任务，特别是当前农村的一项中心任务。为完成这一任务，山东各级党组织按照六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”所提出的要求，已经抽调二万六千多干部（并准备继续抽调），由第一书记挂帅，全党动手，走群众路线，进行整社工作，以便把全体社员的积极性调动起来，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，掀起更大更好更全面的生产高潮。
    会议对山东党组织内部存在的地方主义、分散主义、右倾机会主义倾向，进行了彻底的批判，取得了两条道路、两条路线斗争的又一次的胜利。
    会议满怀信心地指出：1958年社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的巨大胜利，为加速山东省的社会主义建设提供了更为有利的条件，特别是党的八届六中全会决议的公布，向山东省党组织和全体人民指明了方向，只要继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，继续发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风，今年必然会出现更大更好更全面的跃进局面。大会号召，全省各级党组织和全体党员干部，必须努力提高自己的共产主义思想觉悟，百倍增强党的团结，严格遵守党的组织原则，坚决地忠诚地贯彻执行党的方针路线，高度发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风，在党中央和毛主席领导下，团结全省人民，为加速社会主义建设而奋斗。
