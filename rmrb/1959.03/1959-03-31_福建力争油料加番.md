Fuzhou, March 30th (By this newspaper) - Fujian Province is striving for a bumper harvest of oil crops. Currently, in the main peanut-producing areas of Zhangpu, Tong'an, Jinjiang, Nan'an, and other counties, peanut sowing has begun a solar term earlier than last year, with over 158,800 mu already sown. In more than twenty counties, including Fu'an, Pucheng, Ninghua, Yongtai, and Nanping, over 1.2 million mu of oil-tea forests have been planted a month ahead of schedule. Weeding and fertilization work in these newly planted oil-tea forests has also been widely launched.

This year, Fujian Province plans to plant 1.5 million mu of peanuts, an expansion of 420,000 mu compared to last year, with the total output required to more than double last year's; the area for cultivating oil-tea forests is required to reach 2 million mu, with oil-tea seed production doubling last year's; other oil crops such as sesame and rapeseed must also ensure increased production. To strive for a bumper harvest of oil crops this year, some local Party committees have established oil crop production headquarters.

Zhangpu, Nan'an, and other counties, based on the experience of last year's bumper harvest of oil crops, have selected land with better soil, good ventilation, sunny location, and convenient irrigation and drainage for planting peanuts. They have also universally deep-plowed more than one foot deep, applying 400 to 500 dan of farm manure as base fertilizer, with the amount of fertilizer applied increasing by about half compared to last year. Major oil-tea producing areas such as Fu'an, Pucheng, and Ninghua counties have organized professional teams to universally carry out oil-tea inter-tillage, weeding, and fertilization, changing the past habit of inter-tilling oil-tea forests every other year and not applying fertilizer. To ensure a bumper harvest of oil-tea this year, some oil-tea forests have already been sprayed once with a growth stimulant to prevent oil-tea seeds from falling off.

    福建力争油料加番
    本报福州30日电　福建各地力争油料作物大丰收。目前，花生主要产区漳浦、同安、晋江、南安等县，都已比去年提早一个节气开始播种花生，已经播下了十五万八千八百多亩。福安、浦城、宁化、永泰、南平等二十多个县，已提前一个月种好油茶林一百二十多万亩，这些新造的油茶林的除草、施肥工作也已经广泛展开。
    今年福建省计划种花生一百五十万亩，比去年扩大四十二万亩，总产量要求比去年翻一番多；营造油茶林面积要求达到二百万亩，油茶籽的产量比去年翻一番；其他如芝麻、油菜等油料作物，也要确保增产。为了争取今年油料生产大丰收，有些地区党委都成立了油料生产指挥部。
    漳浦、南安等县都根据去年油料作物大丰收的经验，选择了土壤较好、地势通风、向阳、排灌方便的土地，用来播种花生，并普遍深翻一尺以上，施下四百担到五百担农家肥作基肥，施肥量约比去年增加一半。油茶主要产区福安、浦城、宁化等县，都组织了专业队，普遍进行油茶中耕除草、施肥，改变过去油茶林隔年中耕、不施肥料的习惯。为了保证今年油茶丰收，目前部分油茶林已喷射了一次生长刺激剂，避免油茶籽落果。
