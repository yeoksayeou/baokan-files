Wealth Overflowing in the Rice Paddies
——The Experience of Rice-Fish Culture at Donghu Farm in Zhejiang
By Our Correspondent You Qi

Last spring, Donghu Farm in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, conducted a relatively scientific experiment on rice-fish culture in two and a half mu of continuous cropping paddy fields. The result was a yield of 1,616 jin of rice per mu (an increase of 20.7 jin per mu compared to adjacent paddy fields under similar conditions), and a harvest of 434 jin of fish per mu, with a value equivalent to that of rice. It was truly a double harvest of fish and rice!

Rice-fish culture is very beneficial to the growth of rice. For example, fish eat various weeds, as well as pests such as cutworms, rice borers, mosquito larvae, and snails; the fish swimming in the water not only increases the oxygen in the water but also loosens the soil; the excrement and secretions of the fish contain high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, which are excellent fertilizers. As farm workers say: "Rice-fish culture is truly good, loosening the soil, catching insects, and removing weeds. The rice harvest is plentiful, and the fat fish jump, yielding a higher income than growing cotton or hemp."

Last year, Donghu Farm's method for rice-fish culture was as follows: select paddy fields with sufficient water sources and convenient irrigation for fish farming; raise the field ridges to one and a half feet to prevent fish from jumping out and pests from entering; dig three fish pits in the field, each pit two and a half feet deep, five feet wide, and seven feet long, with a three-foot-high sunshade over the pit; fish channels, one foot wide and eight inches deep, connect the pits; it is best to release the fish fry ten days after transplanting rice seedlings to prevent the newly planted seedlings from being knocked down by the fish; before release, apply 70 jin of lime per mu to disinfect and eliminate pests, which also has a fertilizing effect on the rice; constantly pay attention to preventing snakes, water shrews, cats, birds and other harmful animals and insects to protect the safety of the fish; when applying pesticides in the field, drain the water so that the fish swim into the fish pits, and then irrigate the field after the pesticide's potency has passed; do the same during fertilization, weeding, and pest control.

After summarizing last year's experience, Donghu Farm plans to expand rice-fish culture to 300 mu this year, with a target of 3,000 jin of fish and 3,000 jin of rice per mu. To achieve the aforementioned target of 3,000 jin of both rice and fish, they are adopting the following measures:

First, adopt the method of "dense stocking, mixed stocking, and staggered stocking." Dense stocking means releasing more fish fry. Mixed stocking means stocking mainly carp and crucian carp mixed with grass carp and other miscellaneous fish. Staggered stocking allows fish of different sizes to grow together, which not only increases the survival rate but also lengthens the period of supply to the market. In this way, "continuous cropping of rice and continuous cropping of fish" can be achieved, creating a valuable breeding experience for rice-growing areas in southern China. Second, improve feeding management methods. Build sub-ridges in the middle of the paddy field, and dig a large fish pit on each side of the center of the sub-ridge, and then dig a fish channel that crosses the sub-ridge, so that the fish channel connects with the fish pit. In this way, when fertilizing, applying pesticides, and weeding, the water in the upper half of the field can be drained, and the fish can be driven to live in the lower half of the field, which does not hinder field management at all. Third, raise pigs at the edge of the field for comprehensive utilization. Move the pigsty to the edge of the field, where it is more convenient to obtain water, grass, and green fodder; pig manure is applied directly to the field, which the fish like to eat very much. In this way, the fertilizer and feed problems are solved.

Fourth, combine stocking with breeding. Carp and crucian carp can lay eggs, hatch, and reproduce in the paddy fields. As long as the nursing and management of spawning and seedlings are strengthened, the fish fry problem for the second year will be solved.

    财富盈溢稻田中
    ——浙江东湖农场稻田养鱼的经验
    本报记者　尤淇
    浙江绍兴东湖农场去年春天在二亩半连作稻田里，比较科学地进行了养鱼试验，结果连作稻每亩收稻谷一千六百十六斤（比同样条件的邻近稻田平均增产二十点七斤）；每亩收获鱼四百三十四斤，产值与稻谷相当。真是鱼米双丰收！
    稻田养鱼对水稻的生长有很大好处。例如鱼吃各种杂草，还吃蚰虫、螟虫、孑孓和钉螺丝等害虫；鱼在水里游泳，不仅增加了水中的氧气，又起了松土的作用；鱼的排泄物和分泌物含有很高的氮、磷质，是很好的肥料。农场工人说：“稻田养鱼真是好，松土捕虫又除草，稻谷丰收肥鱼跳，比种棉麻收入高。”
    东湖农场去年稻田养鱼的方法是：选择水源充足、灌溉方便的稻田养鱼；田塍加高到一尺半，防鱼跳出，也防害虫侵入；在田里挖三个鱼坑，每个坑深二尺半，阔五尺，长七尺，坑上搭三尺高的凉棚；坑与坑之间挖有相通的鱼道，阔一尺，深八寸；放养鱼苗最好在插秧后十天，以免新栽秧种被鱼撞倒；放养以前，每亩田施用了七十斤石灰来消毒除害，且对水稻有肥效作用；对于水蛇、水狮、猫、鸟类等害兽害虫，要经常注意防范，以保护鱼的安全；田中施农药时，要把田水放干，使鱼游入鱼坑，待药力过后再灌水；在进行施肥、耘田、除虫等操作时也要这样。
    东湖农场总结了去年的经验后，今年准备扩大稻田养鱼三百亩，指标是每亩产鱼三千斤，产稻谷也是三千斤。为要达到上述稻、鱼双三千的指标，他们采用的措施是：
    一、采用“密放、混放、分批放”的办法。密放是鱼苗放的多。混放是以鲤、鲫鱼为主混以草鱼等杂鱼。分批放可使大小鱼交错生长，不仅成活率高，供应市场的日期也长。这样就可做到“连作水稻连作鱼”，可为我国南方水稻区创立一项极宝贵的养殖经验。二、改进饲养管理方法。在稻田中间筑支塍，在支塍中央的两旁各挖一个大鱼坑，再挖一条与支塍十字交叉的鱼道，使鱼道与鱼坑相通。这样，在施肥、施农药、耘田时，就可把上半丘的水放干，把鱼赶到下半丘田生活，对田间管理更无妨碍。三、田头养猪，综合利用。把猪舍搬到田头去，那里取用水草青饲料比较方便；猪粪就近入田，鱼很喜欢吃。这样，肥料、饲料问题都解决了。
    四、放养和繁殖结合。鲤鱼、鲫鱼都能够在稻田里产卵孵化繁殖，只要加强产卵、幼苗期的养护管理，第二年的鱼苗问题就解决了。
