Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 10th. Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a summary report on the work of the Party Central Committee at the Party's Third Congress on March 10. Gomułka first stated that during the period since the Party's previous Congress, many extremely important changes have taken place both in the balance of power between the two social systems in the world—the socialist system and the capitalist system—and in the life of the People's Poland. In this period, all countries in the socialist family have made great leaps forward in their development. Reviewing the path taken by our Party and our people, we can proudly say that despite the many subjective and objective difficulties we have encountered, we have achieved significant victories on this path, and the development of socialist construction in our country has also made tremendous progress. Armed with our own and international experience from this period, our Party is more mature and wiser than before when convening the Third Congress, and more closely united around the immortal ideology of Marxism-Leninism.

Gomułka said: Today we are advancing along the socialist road with firm and resolute steps, and we are more convinced than ever that within a short historical period, socialism will achieve complete victory in our country.

Socialist Countries Rapidly Advance in Peaceful Competition; Imperialist Forces are the Main Danger to the Cause of Peace

Gomułka emphasized that the era we live in is a turning point in human history.

He said that the most prominent feature of the world today is the intensifying competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system. The outcome of this competition has a decisive influence on the direction of development of the entire world and all of humanity. This competition is vividly manifested in the economic development of the Soviet Union and the United States. In less than ten years, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in the output of industrial products. In terms of agricultural output, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States within the next seven years. Other socialist countries are also advancing rapidly.

Gomułka said that the high-speed economic development of the countries in the socialist camp is a common law of socialist economics. Capitalism cannot escape its internal contradictions, which are paralyzing its economy. The law of capitalism is depression and economic crisis. The theories of revisionists, reformists, and the bourgeoisie about the possibility of crisis-free development in capitalism have been completely refuted by life.

Gomułka said that another feature of our time is that the people of Asian and African countries are breaking free from the colonial shackles of the imperialists.

Gomułka said: Socialist countries are making every effort to establish relations with capitalist countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and peaceful cooperation, but the ruling groups of capitalist countries are stubbornly resisting by adopting a "cold war" policy. Imperialism has used all means of "cold war" in its struggle against socialism, and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars for this purpose. Imperialism has rejected all proposals for resolving international disputes. Imperialist aggressor forces have not abandoned their intention to wage a "hot war," although doing so would be tantamount to self-destruction. These aggressive imperialist forces are the main danger to the cause of peace. It is important that after the war, besides this tendency, another tendency is also developing and strengthening in capitalist countries, which is the demand for peaceful coexistence with the socialist world, and the demand to eliminate the danger of a devastating atomic-rocket war. The public in Western countries is increasingly strongly demanding the resolution of international disputes through negotiations.

Gomułka pointed out that the basic force opposing the imperialist war policy is the working class, the international working-class movement based on proletarian internationalism.

Western countries have formed alliances with their former enemies—the German imperialist group, namely the Federal Republic of Germany—thus creating such a dangerous situation in Europe. West German militarists are determined to abolish the Potsdam Agreement, which defined Germany's borders.

Gomułka then exposed Adenauer's conspiracy against Poland's western territories. Gomułka said that the issue is not merely the recognition of Poland's western borders, but first and foremost ensuring the security and inviolability of Poland's western borders today, tomorrow, and forever. Recognizing our borders means strengthening the security of our borders.

Gomułka emphasized that the security of our Oder and Lusatian Neisse River border is built on the unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union, and on the unshakable unity of the socialist camp.

Commenting on West Germany's policies, Gomułka said that West German militarists have now become the main obstacle to easing international tension and the main driving force behind the "cold war." This is particularly evident in the West German government's attitude towards the recent proposals by the Soviet Union and the socialist camp regarding the solution of the West Berlin problem and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. What Adenauer really wants is not the reunification of Germany, but the continuation and intensification of the Cold War, in the hope of finally eliminating the German Democratic Republic. This illusion is futile. The security of the German Democratic Republic is being defended by the entire socialist camp. Gomułka emphasized that the security of the German Democratic Republic is the security of Poland.

International Communist Movement Sees New Prospects for Growth; The Soviet Union Occupies the Foremost Position in the Socialist Family of Nations

Speaking on the issue of the international workers' movement, Gomułka said that various communist parties follow the principle of cooperation among various factions of the workers' movement. The biggest obstacle hindering the smooth and rapid development of the struggle by the working masses for peace, for democratic rights, and for the interests of workers is the anti-communist policies of many leaders and politicians of the Social Democratic Party. Gomułka said that under the banner of anti-communism, it is impossible to conduct an effective struggle to achieve these goals.

Despite the various forms of suppression and attacks by international reactionaries against communists, new prospects for development and growth are emerging before the international communist movement. These prospects are unfolded by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the Congress of Communist Builders. Because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the main force in the international communist movement, and the Soviet Union is the pillar of the international communist movement and the pillar of all socialist countries.

In the international communist movement, there is no "superior" party or "subordinate" party. All parties are equal and free. Each party guides its own activities, but in these activities, they are all guided by the ideology and basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. Each party bears a special responsibility for the fate of the workers' movement in its own country, but all parties have a common sense of responsibility for the unity of the international communist movement, and follow the principles of Leninist proletarian internationalism. These principles are common to all communist and workers' parties, but one of the parties, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, enjoys special prestige among these equal parties, and it occupies an advanced position. This is the position that history has given it.

Everything achieved by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and everything achieved by the Soviet Union under the leadership of the Communist Party is the most important achievement of the entire international communist movement. At the same time, this gives the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a high degree of prestige among the communist and workers' parties of various countries, and makes the Soviet Union occupy the foremost position in the socialist family of nations.

The League of Communists of Yugoslavia Leaves the International Communist Movement; Its Revisionist Program Aims to Split the Socialist Camp

Gomułka said that only the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is undermining the unity of the international communist movement. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia left the ranks of this movement according to its own will—the will of its leaders. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia has chosen for itself a position of outsider, to which it was led by revisionism. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia did not sign the Declaration of the Twelve Communist and Workers' Parties, but this fact has not yet placed it outside the international communist movement. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia only left the international communist movement when it opposed this declaration with its own revisionist program, which aimed to split the unity of the socialist camp and the international solidarity of the communist and workers' parties of various countries.

Gomułka said that according to the arguments of Yugoslav revisionists, the establishment of the community of socialist countries without any common ground with military blocs, that is, the socialist camp, is the reason that prompted the imperialist capitalist world to establish its own military blocs.

Gomułka said that Yugoslav revisionists advocate dissolving the socialist family of nations, abolishing the unity and mutual assistance of the countries in the socialist camp, and call for learning from the Yugoslav example, believing that in this way, international tension will be eliminated and lasting peace can be won in the world. Which communist or non-party person can believe in this absurd, suicidal revisionist concept for socialism? It should be known that if the socialist countries established after World War II were not linked together by the ties of their family of nations, imperialism would have broken them like withered branches.

Gomułka pointed out that the Polish United Workers' Party, like the communist parties of various countries, today has no party-to-party relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, but the hope that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will return to the communist movement has not completely disappeared.

Gomułka continued, brotherly friendship and an unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union are the foundation of Poland's policy, this friendship is built on profound ideological agreement and the principles of Leninist internationalism, and arises from the needs of the two countries. Poland maintains brotherly friendship and cooperative relations with Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries. Bonds of deep and sincere friendship link Poland with the largest Asian country—the People's Republic of China—and other socialist countries in Asia. Gomułka emphasized that we are fully aware that strengthening and developing comprehensive cooperation, mutual assistance, and solidarity among the countries of the socialist camp is the main guarantee for the further rapid development of People's Poland.

In the Fourteen Years After Poland's Liberation, the National Economy Has Been Widely Developed; Continuously Develop Production and Systematically Improve the People's Living Standards

Speaking on Poland's current economic problems, Gomułka pointed out that in the fourteen years since the founding of People's Poland, we have widely developed our national economy, transforming a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country. The period from the last Party Congress to this Party Congress is an important stage in this development. This period is characterized not only by further development of production, but also by gradually overcoming previous neglect and uneven development, and accelerating the improvement of the material well-being of the residents.

Poland's national income is now approximately 1.7 times higher than the 1938 level, and on a per capita basis, the 1958 national income is 2.2 times higher than in 1938. Socialist industry has played a major role in rapidly increasing national income. Coal production is now 1.6 times higher than before the war, electricity has increased 5.6 times, and steel 2.8 times. Gomułka emphasized that in this way, we have shortened the distance between capitalist Poland of the past and economically developed countries. Now we must compete with them in economic development.

Gomułka said that our achievements have laid the foundation for a new program for developing the national economy. This program is included in the economic development guidelines submitted to the Congress.

During this period, the value of industrial output will increase by approximately 80% compared to the current level. The value of agricultural output will increase by 30%. The average annual growth rate of industrial production will be approximately 8.5%. This indicator should not be regarded as final. By 1965, Poland will expand the chemical industry by more than double, steel production will reach 9 million tons, and electricity will increase elevenfold compared to before the war.

The reporter emphasized that it is of great significance to comprehensively strengthen the socialist components in agriculture through the path of ensuring that agricultural production cooperatives have the conditions for rapid economic development. Gomułka said that on the one hand, we must abide by the principles of complete voluntariness and respect for the will of the peasants, and at the same time, we must point out to the working peasants that the path to the continuous development of the people's material welfare and culture is linked to the socialist transformation of the countryside.

The reporter emphasized that it is necessary to follow the principle of combining the continuous improvement of productivity with the systematic improvement of the people's living standards.

Gomułka said that what we are striving for is significant progress in our country's development. This will be our country's contribution to the overall peaceful competition between the socialist system and the capitalist economy.

Strengthening Party Leadership is the Primary Condition for Socialist Democratization; Warn Church Authorities Not to Violate Laws and State Orders

Gomułka said that in addition to correct economic policies, the process of socialist democratization should determine the main direction of efforts to consolidate the people's country and its social foundations. The primary condition for socialist democratization is to strengthen the leading role of the Polish United Workers' Party. The leading role of the Party in the National Front does not mean issuing orders to the parties allied with it. The Party is committed to uniting all forces of the people, and will never implement a political line among the public that distinguishes people according to their attitude towards religion. The Party only evaluates their positions according to how citizens actually treat socialism.

Speaking on the activities of the Catholic Church, the reporter said: The activities of priests must never be used for political purposes, cannot be used to antagonize believers and non-believers, and cannot be used to attack the policies of our Party and the People's Government. We warn the church authorities not to violate laws and state orders, because these violations are happening again and again. We advise an end to the provocations against the People's Government, because this will not benefit the church. We repeat again, we do not want to go to war with the church. However, the church should only be the church, should be limited to religious matters, and should not go beyond the scope of the church.

Gomułka then pointed out that it is necessary to improve the role of the People's Assembly in economic planning and management, and he also praised the activities of workers' self-government organizations.

Gomułka pointed out that civil rights are now better protected than at any time in history. The courts are independent when making judgments.

Gomułka said that the current cultural policy guarantees creative workers all the conditions for development, guarantees that they receive material support from the state, and freedom of creative exploration; the affairs of creative workers will not be subject to administrative interference. The reporter pointed out that the Party first promotes literature whose form is realistic and whose ideological content is socialist. At present, the main task of the Party on the cultural front is to thoroughly eradicate the influence of anti-socialist and revisionist tendencies among creative workers.

The Party is Basically Ideologically and Organizationally United; In the Current Stage, Revisionism is the Party's Main Danger

Speaking on the Party's ideological work, Gomułka said that Marxist-Leninist theory is the only main foundation in the activities of the Polish workers' movement, this is a great historical achievement, and the Polish United Workers' Party protects this achievement like the apple of its eye.

The reporter said: The development of historical events, the domestic and international achievements of the Soviet Union, and the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU fully confirmed the correctness of the line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The Polish United Workers' Party fully agrees with the struggle of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Leninist Central Committee led by Comrade Khrushchev against the anti-Party group. Exposing and rejecting this split group, the group of dogmatists and conservatives, is in the interests of the entire international workers' movement.

The reporter pointed out that in the current stage, revisionism is the main danger to the Party, and the Party has given revisionism a firm blow, which is a necessary condition for thoroughly eradicating dogmatism and sectarianism.

Gomułka said that today we can say that our Party has basically achieved ideological and organizational unity. The path taken by our Party from the Second Congress to the Third Congress was fraught with difficulties. The Party overcame these difficulties victoriously. The reason why the Party was able to overcome these difficulties is because, although it has not been able to avoid various mistakes, it has never deviated from the Marxist-Leninist position, and has always been loyal to its basic principles.

Gomułka emphasized that our Party is loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism and the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp, and it has been, is, and will always be loyal to the Polish working class and the Polish people. The historical task of our generation is to build socialism in our country. In leading this construction work, we rely on the endless strength of the Polish working masses, believe in their wisdom, and desire to turn our motherland into a prosperous socialist country with a highly developed economy and culture.

### 哥穆尔卡同志在波兰党代会上作报告  波兰沿着社会主义道路前进

    哥穆尔卡同志在波兰党代会上作报告
    波兰沿着社会主义道路前进
    新华社华沙10日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡3月10日在党的第三次代表大会上作了党中央委员会的工作总结报告。哥穆尔卡首先说，在党的上次代表大会以来的这个时期中，在世界两个社会制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度的力量对比方面，在人民波兰生活方面都发生了许多极其重要的变化。在这个时期内，社会主义大家庭中的所有国家在它们的发展方面都跃进了一大步。在回顾我们党和我国人民所走过的道路时，我们可以自豪地说：尽管我们遇到很多主观上的和客观上的困难，但是在这条道路上还是取得了重大的胜利，我国社会主义建设的发展也取得了巨大的进展。用这个时期内我们自己的经验和国际经验武装起来的我们的党，在召开第三次代表大会的时候比以前更为成熟、更为明智，更加紧密地团结在不朽的马克思列宁主义思想的周围了。
    哥穆尔卡说：我们今天以坚定的和坚决的步伐沿着社会主义道路前进，我们比以前任何时候更相信，在一个短短的历史时期内，社会主义将在我国取得完全胜利。
    社会主义国家在和平竞赛中迅速前进　帝国主义势力是和平事业的主要危险
    哥穆尔卡强调说，我们所生活的时代是人类历史的一个转折点。
    他说，今天世界的最显著的特点是，世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系之间的竞赛每年都在加强。这种竞赛的结果对全世界、全人类的发展方向起着决定性的影响。这种竞赛鲜明地表现在苏联和美国的经济发展上。再用不到十年功夫，苏联将在工业产品产量方面超过美国。在农业产量方面，苏联将在今后七年内超过美国。其他社会主义国家也正在迅速前进。
    哥穆尔卡说，社会主义阵营国家高速度的经济发展是社会主义经济的共同规律。资本主义不能摆脱它的内部矛盾，这种矛盾正在使它的经济陷于瘫痪状态。资本主义的规律性是萧条和经济危机。修正主义者、改良主义者和资产阶级关于资本主义可能没有危机地发展的理论，已经被生活驳得体无完肤了。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们时代的另一个特点是，亚非国家人民正在纷纷挣脱帝国主义者的殖民主义镣铐。
    哥穆尔卡说：社会主义国家尽一切努力根据和平共处和和平合作的原则来同资本主义国家建立关系，可是资本主义国家统治集团采取“冷战”政策负隅顽抗。帝国主义在进行反对社会主义的斗争时，使用了一切“冷战”的手段，并且为了这个目的花费了数以亿计的美元。帝国主义拒绝了有关解决国际争端的一切建议。帝国主义侵略势力还没有放弃打“热战”的打算，尽管这样做等于自取灭亡。这种侵略成性的帝国主义势力正是和平事业的主要危险。重要的是，战后，在资本主义国家除了这种倾向外，还有另一种倾向也正在发展加强，这就是要求同社会主义世界和平共处，要求消除一场毁灭性的原子——火箭战争的危险的倾向。西方国家的公众越来越有力地要求通过谈判来解决国际争端。
    哥穆尔卡指出，反对帝国主义战争政策的基本力量是工人阶级，是以无产阶级国际主义为基础的国际工人阶级运动。
    西方国家同它们昨天的敌人——德国帝国主义集团，即德意志联邦共和国结成联盟，这样，就在欧洲造成了如此危险的局势。西德军国主义者一心想废除确定德国国界的波茨坦协定。
    哥穆尔卡接着揭露了阿登纳对波兰西部领土的阴谋。哥穆尔卡说，问题不单是承认波兰西部的边界，问题首先在于今天、明天、永远地保证波兰西部边界的安全和不可侵犯性。承认我国边界对我们来讲就是加强我国边界的安全。
    哥穆尔卡强调指出，我们奥得河和路西提安的尼斯河国界的安全建筑在同苏联结成的牢不可破的同盟的基础上，建筑在社会主义阵营的不可动摇的团结一致的基础上。
    哥穆尔卡在评述西德的政策时说，西德军国主义者现在成了缓和国际紧张局势的主要障碍，成了“冷战”的主要推动力。这特别表现于西德政府对苏联和社会主义阵营最近提出的关于解决西柏林问题和缔结对德和约的建议的态度方面。阿登纳真正希望的不是德国的重新统一，而是继续和加紧进行冷战，以期最后消灭德意志民主共和国。这种幻想是枉费心机的。德意志民主共和国的安全是由整个社会主义阵营在捍卫着的。哥穆尔卡强调指出，德意志民主共和国的安全就是波兰的安全。
    国际共产主义运动面前展现新的壮大前景
    苏联在社会主义国家大家庭中居首要地位
    在谈到国际工人运动的问题时，哥穆尔卡说，各个共产党遵循工人运动各派别合作的原则。妨碍工人群众争取和平、争取民主权利、争取工人利益的斗争顺利和迅速发展的最大障碍，莫过于社会民主党的许多领袖和政客的反共政策。哥穆尔卡说，在反共的旗帜下，不可能进行有效的斗争来达到这些目的。
    尽管国际反动派对共产党人进行各种形式的镇压和攻击，但是，在国际共产主义运动面前正展现着发展壮大的新的前景。这种前景是由苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会——共产主义建设者的代表大会——所展开的。因为苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动中的主要力量，苏联是国际共产主义运动的支柱，是所有社会主义国家的支柱。
    在国际共产主义运动中，没有“上级”党或“下级”党之分。所有的党都是平等的，都是自由的。每一个党自己指导它的活动，但是在这种活动中，它们都是以马克思列宁主义的思想体系和基本原理为指南的。每一个党都对本国工人运动的命运负有特殊的责任，但是所有的党，它们对国际共产主义运动的团结都具有共同的责任感，都遵循着列宁主义无产阶级国际主义的原则。这些原则对于所有的共产党和工人党都是共同的，但是其中的一个党，苏联共产党在这些平等的党中享有特别的威信，它占有先进的地位。这是历史赋给它这个地位的。
    苏联共产党所取得的一切和苏联在共产党领导下所取得的一切，是整个国际共产主义运动的最重大的成果。这同时使苏联共产党在各国共产党和工人党中享有很高的威信，并且使苏联在社会主义国家大家庭中居于首要的地位。
    南共产主义者联盟离开国际共产主义运动
    它的修正主义纲领旨在分裂社会主义阵营
    哥穆尔卡说，只有南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟破坏国际共产主义运动的团结。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟按照它自己的意志——它的领导人员的意志——离开了这个运动的队伍。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟为它自己选择了一种局外人的立场，它是被修正主义带到这种立场上去的。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟并没有在十二国共产党和工人党宣言上签字，但是这个事实还没有使它处于国际共产主义运动之外。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟直到它以自己的修正主义纲领来反对这个宣言的时候才离开了国际共产主义运动，这个纲领的目的是分裂社会主义阵营的团结和各国共产党和工人党的国际团结。
    哥穆尔卡说，根据南斯拉夫修正主义者的论点，同军事集团毫无共同之处的社会主义各国人民共同体，即社会主义阵营的建立，是促使帝国主义资本主义世界建立自己的军事集团的原因。
    哥穆尔卡说，南斯拉夫修正主义者主张解散社会主义国家大家庭，取消社会主义阵营各国的团结一致和互相帮助，并号召学习南斯拉夫的榜样，他们认为，这样一来，国际紧张局势就会消除，持久和平就能在全世界得胜。有哪一个共产党人或非党人士能相信这种荒谬的、对社会主义来说是自杀性的修正主义概念呢。要知道，如果第二次世界大战以后建立的社会主义国家不以它们的大家庭的纽带联系在一起，帝国主义就会把它们像枯枝似地折断了。
    哥穆尔卡指出，波兰统一工人党像各国共产党一样，今天同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟没有任何党与党之间的联系，但是，对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟回到共产主义运动来的希望还没有完全消失。
    哥穆尔卡继续说，同苏联的兄弟友谊和牢不可破的联盟是波兰政策的基础，这种友谊是建立在深刻的思想一致和列宁主义的国际主义原则之上的，是从两个国家的需要产生的。波兰同捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和其他人民民主国家保持着兄弟的友谊和合作关系。深刻和真诚友谊的纽带把波兰同最大的亚洲国家——中华人民共和国——和亚洲的其他社会主义国家联系在一起。哥穆尔卡强调说，我们充分意识到，加强和发展社会主义阵营各国之间的全面合作、互助和团结，是人民波兰进一步迅速发展的主要保证。
    波兰解放后十四年中广泛地发展了国民经济
    不断发展生产并有系统地提高人民生活水平
    在谈到波兰当前经济问题时，哥穆尔卡指出，在人民波兰建国以来的十四年中，我们广泛地发展了我们的国民经济，把落后的农业国变成工业—农业国。从上次党代表大会到这次党代表大会这一时期，是这一发展的重要阶段。这一时期的特点不仅是进一步发展了生产，而且还逐步克服了以前的疏忽和不均衡发展的现象，加速提高了居民的物质福利。
    现在波兰的国民收入超过1938年水平大约一点七倍，按人口平均计算，1958年国民收入超过1938年的二点二倍。社会主义工业在迅速增加国民收入方面起了主要作用。现在煤产量比战前增加了一点六倍，电力增加了五点六倍，钢二点八倍。哥穆尔卡强调指出，这样一来，我们就缩短了过去资本主义波兰同经济发达的国家之间的距离。现在我们要在经济发展方面同它们较量。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们的成就为发展国民经济的新纲领奠定了基础。这项纲领包括在提交代表大会的经济发展指示中。
    在这一时期，工业产值将比目前增长大约80％。农业产值将增加30％。工业每年平均的生产增长速度约为8.5％。这个指标不应视为最后的。到1965年，波兰将扩大化学工业一倍多，钢产量达到九百万吨，电力将比战前增加十一倍。
    报告人着重指出，通过保证农业生产合作社有迅速发展经济的条件的途径来全面加强农业中的社会主义成分具有重大意义。哥穆尔卡说，我们一方面要遵守完全自愿和尊重农民意志的原则，同时要向劳动农民指出，不断发展人民物质福利和文化的途径是同农村的社会主义改造联系在一起的。
    报告人着重指出，必须遵循不断提高生产力同有系统地提高人民生活水平相结合的原则。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们所要争取的东西就是我国发展中的重大进步。这将是我国对社会主义体系同资本主义经济的总的和平竞赛的贡献。
  加强党的领导是社会主义民主化首要条件
  警告教会当局不要破坏法律和国家命令
    哥穆尔卡说，除了正确的经济政策而外，社会主义民主化的过程应当决定巩固人民国家及其社会基础方面的主要努力方向。社会主义民主化的首要条件是加强波兰统一工人党的领导作用。党在全国阵线中的领导作用并不等于对和它联盟的党发号施令。党致力于团结人民的一切力量，决不在公众中间执行依照对宗教的态度来区分人的政治路线。党只依照公民们实际对待社会主义的态度来评价他们的立场。
    报告人在讲到天主教教会活动时说：神父的活动决不能被用于政治目的，不能用来使教徒和非教徒互相对立和用来攻击我们党和人民政府的政策。我们警告教会当局，不要破坏法律和国家命令，因为这种破坏现象又在一再发生。我们劝告结束对人民政权的挑衅，因为这对教会不会有什么好处。我们再重复一遍，我们不想同教会发生战争。但是，教会只应是教会，应该只限于宗教问题，而不要超出教会的范围。
    哥穆尔卡接着指出，必须提高人民会议在经济计划工作和管理工作方面的作用，他还对工人自治机构的活动作了好评。
    哥穆尔卡指出，公民权利现在得到比历史上任何时期都要好的维护。法院作出判决时是独立的。
    哥穆尔卡说，目前的文化政策保证创作工作者有一切发展条件，保证他们得到国家的物质支持，和创作探索的自由；创作工作者的事务不会受到行政方面的干涉。报告人指出，党首先提倡形式是现实主义的、思想内容是社会主义的文学。目前党在文化战线上的主要任务是彻底铲除反社会主义的和修正主义的倾向在创作工作者中间的影响。
    党基本上已在思想上组织上团结一致
    在目前阶段修正主义是党的主要危险
    哥穆尔卡在谈到党的思想工作时说，马克思列宁主义理论是波兰工人运动活动中的唯一主要基础，这是伟大的历史成果，波兰统一工人党像保护眼珠一样保护着这种成果。
    报告人说：历史事件的发展，苏联在国内和国际上的成就以及苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议完全证实了苏共第二十次代表大会路线的正确性。波兰统一工人党完全同意苏联共产党和赫鲁晓夫同志领导的列宁主义中央委员会对反党集团的斗争。揭露和摒弃这个分裂集团、教条主义和保守主义者集团是符合整个国际工人运动的利益的。
    报告人指出，在目前阶段，修正主义是党的主要危险，党给了修正主义以坚决打击，这种打击是彻底根除教条主义和宗派主义的必要条件。
    哥穆尔卡说，今天我们可以说，我们党基本上已经在思想上和组织上达到了团结一致。我党在第二次代表大会到第三次代表大会这段时期所走过的道路上，布满了重重困难。党胜利地克服了这些困难。党之所以能克服这些困难，是因为，尽管它没有能够避免各种错误，但始终没有脱离过马克思列宁主义立场，始终忠于它的基本原则。
    哥穆尔卡强调说，我党忠于无产阶级国际主义和社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结的旗帜，它过去、现在和将来始终忠于波兰工人阶级和波兰人民。我们这一代的历史任务是在我国建设社会主义。我们在领导这项建设的工作中依靠波兰劳动群众的无穷无尽的力量，相信他们的智慧和把我们祖国变成具有高度发达的经济和文化的、繁荣的社会主义国家的愿望。
