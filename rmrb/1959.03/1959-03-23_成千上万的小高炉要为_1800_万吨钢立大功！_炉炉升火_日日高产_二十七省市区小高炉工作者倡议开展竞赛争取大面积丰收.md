Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: About half of China's pig iron production this year will be produced by small blast furnaces. How to prompt the small blast furnaces scattered across the country to produce more iron, produce better iron, save coke, and reduce costs? This is a new and significant issue in this year's steel production. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a national small blast furnace production technology conference to exchange experiences in small blast furnace production and formulated a set of small blast furnace operation essentials and technical measures. Small blast furnace workers from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions challenged and responded to each other, encouraging each other to launch a socialist competition across the country to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest of high-quality and high-yield small blast furnaces. They are full of confidence that they will make small blast furnaces shine in this year's steel production and establish merit in winning 18 million tons of steel.

According to statistics, there are currently thousands upon thousands of small blast furnaces that have been matched and built across the country, with a volume of more than 60,000 cubic meters. Most of these small blast furnaces were built last year, especially in the second half of last year, and have been and are being put into production one after another. These small blast furnaces were a vital force in the battle to double steel production last year, and are playing an even more significant role in completing this year's pig iron plan. However, some of these small blast furnaces have not yet been ignited; and a considerable portion of those that have been ignited are experiencing a phenomenon of "two lows and two highs" in production. The two lows are low utilization coefficient and low qualified rate of pig iron; the two highs are high coke ratio (the amount of coke consumed to produce one ton of iron) and high costs. Small blast furnace workers across the country passed a competition initiative to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest of small blast furnaces at this meeting, determined to reverse this situation of "two lows and two highs" and transform it into "two highs and two lows," that is, high utilization coefficient, high qualified rate of pig iron, low coke ratio, and low costs. The main goals proposed in the initiative are: strive to reach 90% for the ignition rate of small blast furnaces nationwide in April; gradually strive for an average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces to produce more than one ton of iron per cubic meter of volume; strive to reach more than 95% for the qualified rate of pig iron; and first require the consumption of coke per ton of iron to be reduced to below 1,600 kilograms, and gradually strive towards the goal of 1,200 kilograms.

In order to achieve these indicators, the meeting decided to take measures in four aspects: First, do a good job in the management of iron ore, coke, refractory materials, and various auxiliary production materials. It is required that all regions and enterprises strengthen the supply of coking coal and save the use of coking coal, try every means to increase the iron content of iron ore, and quickly build simple coking furnaces and simple refractory material plants. Second, conscientiously implement the small blast furnace operation essentials and technical measures, and rapidly improve the production technology level of small blast furnaces. In particular, it is necessary to vigorously grasp desulfurization work, take a series of desulfurization measures in the production processes of coal washing, sintering ore, and smelting, and strive to eliminate sulfur before it enters the steelmaking furnace. Third, further improve the rational layout and factory production of steel and iron bases, improve business management, and increase labor productivity. Fourth, carry out mass movements and technical revolutions on a large scale in small blast furnace production.

These measures were proposed by summarizing the advanced production experience of various high-yield, high-quality, and long-life small blast furnaces in various regions. This meeting exchanged and promoted these experiences. For example, the method of multi-nozzle combustion in hot-blast stoves, which is currently being promoted in many places, is a major technical reform that can have an immediate effect on improving pig iron quality and reducing pig iron costs. This technical reform, pioneered by the employees of the Youxian People's Iron Smelting Plant in Hunan Province, involves modifying the hot-blast stove to become multi-nozzle combustion, so that the wind temperature of the hot-blast stove rises from the original four hundred degrees to seven hundred degrees. After this modification, the proportion of high-quality iron in the Youxian People's Iron Smelting Plant increased to more than 95%, and the consumption of coke per ton of pig iron was also reduced by more than half. Some small blast furnace workers in Chaling, Hunan, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Macheng, Hubei, and other places crushed the ore into very small particles before putting it into the furnace for smelting, that is, letting the small blast furnace eat "refined grains," which very effectively increased the output of the small blast furnace. After completing the site selection work for small-scale steel, iron, and coal production bases, Hunan Province further rationally adjusted the connection relationships between steel, iron, coal, and other production units, and implemented counterpart connections between the larger iron plants and coal mine bases in the province, ensuring the fuel required for small blast furnaces and greatly reducing pig iron costs. The Hechuan County Steel Plant in Sichuan took a series of measures to create a long-lived small blast furnace. The volume of this small blast furnace is 35 cubic meters, and it has been in operation since July 1955, having produced for three years and eight months. (Picture attached)

The two 12-cubic-meter small blast furnaces of the Tashui Iron Plant in Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, have rapidly increased their utilization coefficient from about 0.5 to 1.1 since January and February of this year. The quality of pig iron is good, and the average cost in February has also been reduced by about 27%, making them the banner of high yield and high quality among small blast furnaces in Sichuan Province. This is No. 1 small blast furnace tapping iron.

    成千上万的小高炉要为1800万吨钢立大功！
    炉炉升火　日日高产
    二十七省市区小高炉工作者倡议开展竞赛争取大面积丰收
    新华社22日讯　我国今年的生铁产量约有一半将由小型高炉生产。怎样促使遍布全国的小高炉多产铁，产好铁，节省焦炭，降低成本？这是今年钢铁生产当中一项关系重大的新课题。冶金工业部在最近召开的全国小高炉生产技术会议，交流了小高炉生产的经验，制订了一套小高炉操作要点和技术措施方案。来自二十七个省、市、自治区的小高炉工作者互相挑战应战，相勉在全国开展一个为争取小高炉优质高产大面积丰收的社会主义竞赛；他们信心百倍地要使小高炉在今年的钢铁生产上大放异彩，为夺取一千八百万吨钢建立功勋。
    据统计，目前全国各地已经配套、建成的成千上万座小高炉，容积有六万多立方公尺。这些小高炉大部分是在去年，特别是在去年下半年建成的，已经并正在陆续投入生产。这些小高炉是去年为钢产量翻一番而战的一支生力军，在完成今年生铁计划中，正发挥着更加重大的作用。但是，现在这些小高炉还有一部分没有开炉；已经开炉的，也有相当大一部分在生产上存在着“两低、两高”的现象。两低是利用系数低，生铁合格率低；两高是焦比（炼一吨铁消耗的焦炭数量）高，成本高。全国各地的小高炉工作者，在这次会上通过了一项争取小高炉大面积丰收的竞赛倡议书，决心把这种“两低、两高”的局面倒转过来，而变成为“两高、两低”，即利用系数高、生铁合格率高，焦比低，成本低。倡议书中提出的主要奋斗目标是：全国小高炉的开炉率，争取在4月份达到90％；小高炉的平均利用系数，要逐渐争取到每一立方公尺的容积产铁一吨以上；生铁合格率争取达到95％以上；生产每吨铁消耗的焦炭，首先要求下降到一千六百公斤以下，逐渐向一千二百公斤的目标奋斗。
    为了实现这些指标，会议决定从四方面采取措施：第一，作好铁矿石、焦炭、耐火材料和各种辅助生产材料的管理工作。要求各地和各企业，加强焦煤的供应工作并节约使用焦煤，千方百计地提高铁矿石的含铁量，迅速兴建简易炼焦炉和简易耐火材料厂。第二，认真贯彻执行小高炉操作要点和技术措施方案，迅速提高小高炉的生产技术水平。特别是要狠狠地抓脱硫工作，在洗煤、烧结矿石、冶炼等生产过程中，采取一系列的脱硫措施，争取在硫进入炼钢炉之先就把它消灭掉。第三，进一步做好钢铁基点的合理布局和生产工厂化，改善经营管理，提高劳动生产率。第四，在小高炉生产中大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命。
    这些措施是总结了各地小高炉的各种高产、优质、长寿的先进生产经验提出的。这次会议交流和推广了这些经验。例如，目前正在许多地方推广的热风炉多嘴燃烧的方法，就是一项对提高生铁质量、降低生铁成本能收立竿见影之效的重大技术改革。这项由湖南攸县人民炼铁厂职工首创的技术改革，就是把热风炉加以改装，成为多嘴燃烧，使热风炉的风温由原来的四百多度升高到七百度。这样改装以后，攸县人民炼铁厂优质铁的比例提高到了95％以上，每吨生铁消耗的焦炭也降低了一半多。湖南茶陵、河北石家庄、湖北麻城等地有一些小高炉的职工，把矿石破碎成很小的颗粒再入炉冶炼，也就是说让小高炉吃“细粮”，非常有效地提高了小高炉的产量。湖南省在完成了小型钢、铁、煤生产基点的定点工作以后，进一步合理调整了钢、铁、煤等生产单位的衔接关系，把全省较大的铁厂和煤矿基点实行对口，保证了小高炉所需的燃料，并将大大降低生铁成本。四川合川县钢铁厂采取一系列措施，创造了一座长寿的小高炉。这座小高炉的容积是三十五立方公尺，从1955年7月开炉，至今已经生产了三年零八个月。（附图片）
    四川省威远县沓水铁厂的两座十二立方公尺的小高炉，今年1、2月份以来，利用系数由零点五左右迅速提高到一点一；生铁质量良好，2月份平均成本也降低了27％左右，成为四川省小高炉中高产、高质的旗帜。这是一号小高炉在出铁。
