Editor's Note

    Grasping the climate and understanding the situation are important for any department, any work, at any time. For light industrial production units responsible for producing a large number of daily-use products, it is especially necessary to understand the situation and ascertain the climate in order to produce more of what is needed and less of what is not.

    For light industrial production units, the commercial sector can be regarded as a general collection of information, as it is closely connected with consumers and familiar with the needs and preferences of the masses. Therefore, if light industrial production departments want to improve their products and better serve consumers, they must frequently contact the commercial sector.

    The light industrial and commercial departments of Taiyuan City actively collaborate by sharing information, revealing their resources, and solving problems as they arise, arranging production based on what goods are lacking. This approach is worth promoting.

    摸气候　通情报
    摸气候，摸情况，对任何部门、任何工作，在任何时候都是重要的。担负着生产大批日用产品的轻工业生产单位，当前应该多生产什么，少生产什么，尤其需要摸清情况，弄清气候。
    商业部门，对轻工业生产单位来说，可以算是情况的总汇，它和消费者有着密切联系，熟悉群众的需要和喜爱。所以，轻工业生产部门要做到改进产品，更好地为消费者服务，必须经常和商业部门取得联系。
    太原市轻工业部门和商业部门用互通情报、互摆家底，积极开展协作，随时发现问题随时解决，缺什么商品，安排什么生产。这种作法值得提倡。
