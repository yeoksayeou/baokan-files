    Female Vanguard Transporting Timber by Raft
    Xie Jing
    On both banks of the Wu River in Guangdong Province, verdant mountains connect one after another, and shoals on the Wu River follow one after another. The clear river water flows here, turning sharply downwards with a roaring sound. Eight timber rafts set off from Lechang County towards Shaoguan. Behind the three timber rafts manned by male workers, each raft had a woman at the head, steering.
    Women rafting timber is a new thing on the Wu River. Wen Xinlan, this young girl of only eighteen, was selected by the leadership to experiment with rafting when the task of timber transport increased and the labor force was insufficient. Her usual wish came true, and she was extremely happy, but since she had never done it before, and the shoals were numerous and the water deep, she couldn't help but feel flustered. Retreat? Of course not. If she didn't know how, she would learn.
    When tying the rafts on weekdays, Wen Xinlan had been watching the male workers' movements and memorizing them. Therefore, actual operation today was fairly smooth. However, as she approached the first shoal, she became very nervous. Facing the roaring sound and rapidly flying river water, she stared at the raft being steered by the men in front, and followed their example. She bent her waist to lift the pole, pushed it to the left, stepped back a few steps, and then pulled it back with all her strength, repeating this several times. The raft turned sharply to the left, and then she held the pole motionless, and the raft was rushed far away by the river water in an instant, and the shoal was safely crossed. From Lechang to Shaoguan, there were more than twenty shoals. The more shoals she crossed, the more experience she gained, and she no longer panicked.
    On the way, one of the rafts that came with them ran aground in the shoal. Wen Xinlan immediately stopped her own raft to provide assistance. In the rapid current that submerged her lower body, she and everyone else persisted in an hour of intense labor before the raft moved again.
    The five timber rafts driven by women finally reached their destination. The Shaoguan Prefectural Forestry Bureau awarded a red flag of "Pioneering Female Rafting Vanguard" to this group of pioneers who created the precedent of women rafting.

    流放木材的女尖兵
    谢京
    在广东省武江两岸，青翠山峦一个连接一个，武江上的浅滩一个跟着一个。清彻的江水流到这里急转直下，发出嗬嗬的巨响。八条木排由乐昌县向韶关进发。在由男工放运的三条木排后面，每条木排都有一个妇女在排头掌梢。
    妇女放木排，是武江河道的新鲜事。温新兰，这个才十八岁的小姑娘，是在木材放运任务加重，劳动力不足时被领导上挑选试验放排的。平日的愿望实现了，她高兴极了，可是，自己从来没有放过，滩多水又深，却又不免惊慌。退缩吗？当然不能。不会，就学会它。
    平日扎排的时候，温新兰就把男工撑排的动作看在眼里、记在心里了。因此今天实际操作起来倒还算顺手。但是，临近第一个滩的时候，心里就七上八下的紧张起来了。她迎着声音震耳、河水急飞的滩头，紧盯着前面男工撑的排，学着他们的样子。只见她弯着腰把梢提起，推向左边，后退几步，然后用尽全身的力气拉回来，如此连续反复几次，木排就向左边紧转弯，这时她一动不动地把住梢，木排在瞬息之间就给河水冲得远远的，滩也就安全地渡过了。从乐昌到韶关，有二十多个滩，滩过得多，经验也多，她也就不慌了。
    途中，同来的一条排在滩中搁浅了。温新兰立即停了自己撑的排前往援救。在淹浸着下半身的急流中，她和大家一道，坚持了一个钟头的紧张劳动，木排才又活动了。
    由妇女驾驶的五条木排终于抵达目的地。韶关专署林业局把一面“放排尖兵花木兰”的红旗，奖给了这批首创妇女放排先例的尖兵。
