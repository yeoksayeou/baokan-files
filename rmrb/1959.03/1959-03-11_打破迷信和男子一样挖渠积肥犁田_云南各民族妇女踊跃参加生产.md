Kunming, March 10th (By our own correspondent) - "New things abound in the high tide, plowing sisters smile happily. Passersby don't recognize the treasure, mistakenly calling the girls 'older brother'."

This is a folk song praising the women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan who, in the Great Leap Forward, broke through all kinds of superstitious ideas and actively and boldly participated in various labor production. At present, more than 90% of women of all ethnic groups in the province have participated in field labor and factory labor. The attendance rate of rural women has leaped to over 95%, playing a huge role in completing various tasks.

Last year, in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, women of all ethnic groups accounted for 71% of the workers building water conservancy projects. This played a significant role in the high yield of grain in Nujiang, which increased sixfold last year, breaking the superstition that women could not build reservoirs. In the fight against drought, women in various places dug tens of thousands of "March 8th" Women's Ditches, Women's Dams, Husband and Wife Wells, and Sister Wells, etc., and joined the people in overcoming the historically rare threat of drought. Last year, women completed 90% of the fertilizer required for spring planting, and are now investing in the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement to strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959. In the past, many women of the Dai, Yi, and Hani ethnic groups, who historically had no habit of accumulating fertilizer, not only were afraid of getting dirty and did not accumulate fertilizer themselves, but also did not allow their husbands who participated in fertilizer accumulation to enter the house. Now, they are taking the lead in cleaning toilets, digging ditch mud, and carrying manure. In these ethnic groups, there are still superstitious ideas circulating, such as "Women digging fields, three years of drought" and "Women plowing fields, the cow will cry." In some Han areas, there is also the saying that "Women plowing fields, men are not honorable." Now this situation has changed. Hundreds of thousands of women plowing experts have emerged throughout the province, completely changing people's views.

On the industrial front, millions of women throughout the province have participated in the great battle for steel, iron, copper, and various new industrial constructions. "Liu Hulan" and "Mulan" steelmaking furnaces, "Sisters Ironmaking Furnaces" and "Ten Elder Sisters Copper Smelting Furnaces" have been established everywhere, and tens of thousands of factories operated by women have been set up.

Under the education of the Party and the inspiration of the General Line, women of all ethnic groups have also undergone profound changes in their mental outlook through labor practice. A surge of striving for the top is everywhere. In the Qujing and Zhaotong special districts alone, more than 100,000 advanced model women have emerged in the Great Leap Forward. There are about hundreds of thousands of women experts in the province who can drill holes, blast, operate flying buckets, and manufacture and use handcarts.

    打破迷信和男子一样挖渠积肥犁田
    云南各民族妇女踊跃参加生产
    本报昆明10日电　“高潮到来新事多，犁田姐姐笑呵呵，过路人儿不识宝，错把姑娘叫大哥”。
    这是人们称赞云南各族妇女在大跃进中，冲破种种迷信思想，积极大胆参加各种劳动生产的一首民歌。目前全省各族妇女已有90％以上参加了田间劳动和工厂劳动，农村妇女的出勤率跃进到95％以上，在完成各项任务中发挥了巨大的力量。
    怒江傈僳族自治州去年修水利的民工中，各族妇女就占了71％。对去年怒江粮食翻六倍的高额丰产起了很大的作用，打破了过去认为妇女不能修水库的迷信。在抗旱斗争中，各处妇女挖了成千上万个“三八”妇女沟、妇女坝、夫妻井、姊妹井等，和全民一道战胜了历史上罕见的干旱威胁。妇女们去年完成了大春需肥量的90％，目前又投入了争取1959年农业更大跃进的积肥造肥运动。历史上从来没有积肥习惯的傣族、彝族、哈尼族等许多妇女过去不仅自己怕脏不积肥，也不准参加积肥的丈夫进房门，现在都带头淘厕所、挖沟泥、挑大粪。在这些民族中，还流传着“妇女挖田，天旱三年”、“妇女犁田牛会哭”等迷信思想，一些汉族地区也有“妇女犁田，男人不光彩”的说法。现在这种情况都改变了，全省出现了几十万个妇女犁田能手，彻底改变了人们的看法。
    在工业战线上，全省上百万妇女都参加了大战钢、铁、铜及各项新的工业建设，到处建立了“刘胡兰”、“花木兰”炼钢炉、“姊妹炼铁炉”和“十大姐炼铜炉”，办起了数万个由妇女操作的工厂。
    在党的教育及总路线的鼓舞下，各族妇女通过劳动实践，精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化，到处都是争上游的热潮，仅曲靖、昭通两个专区，在大跃进中涌现出来的先进模范妇女就有十万多人。全省约有几十万打炮眼、爆破、操纵飞兜、制造与使用手推车的妇女能手。
