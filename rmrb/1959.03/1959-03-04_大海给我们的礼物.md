    The sea is the home of living things and the ultimate destination of all elements on Earth.
    In the embrace of the sea, grow bizarre and diverse marine flora and fauna, which can be used for human consumption; some can also be used as fertilizer, called sea fertilizer.
    In the waves of the sea, are dissolved all possible soluble substances, and almost every element on the continent can be found in seawater.
    It is estimated that the total volume of seawater in the world is 137 million cubic kilometers. The rivers of the world bring 300 million tons of dissolved substances from the land to the ocean every year. Undoubtedly, the treasures of the sea are very rich.
    Among these dissolved substances, including even the atoms of water, there are seventeen elements such as oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, potassium, bromine, carbon, strontium, boron, fluorine, silicon, rubidium, lithium, nitrogen, and iodine, accounting for more than 99.99% of the total weight of seawater. Among them, four substances, namely salt, iodine, bromine, and magnesium, are particularly needed by humans to be extracted from seawater. These are the best gifts the sea gives us.
    One of the best gifts the sea gives us is salt.
    Salt is a compound of chlorine and sodium elements. Although there are some salt lakes and salt wells inland, the sea is its richest source. People introduce seawater into the salt fields on the seashore and let the sun evaporate the water, and the crystals of salt appear.
    Generally speaking, each of us contains more than half a kilogram of salt in our bodies, and we cannot live without salt. In addition, salt is also an important raw material for manufacturing soap, glass, bleaching powder and many other chemical industrial products.
    The second best gift the sea gives us is iodine.
    Iodine is a gray crystal with a metallic luster, which easily volatilizes into purple vapor.
    Every place on Earth contains a small amount of iodine; rocks, soils, and rivers all contain iodine. Animals, plants, and human bodies contain more iodine, and seawater contains the most abundant amount of iodine, with each liter of seawater containing two milligrams of iodine. Marine flora and fauna, such as seaweed, sponges, and kelp, all contain large amounts of iodine, with each ton of seaweed containing several kilograms of iodine.
    Iodine is beneficial for healing and treating diseases in the human body. It has the ability to stop bleeding, sterilize, and prevent wound infection (however, too much iodine can also poison people); it also has the effect of promoting metabolism, preventing arteriosclerosis, and treating goiter. If the human body lacks iodine, goiter symptoms will occur.
    Iodine also has a wide range of uses in industry. Organic compounds of iodine do not allow X-rays to pass through. Injecting this compound into human tissue can create a particularly clear image of the inside of the tissue.
    If we add a kind of iodine salt to celluloid, it will prevent light waves from penetrating from all sides. This celluloid sheet with iodine salt added can be used to manufacture very good magnifying glasses that can completely replace microscopes, especially suitable for use during field exploration. If you install celluloid sheets with iodine salt on the windows of your car, you will not be blinded by the headlights of oncoming cars when you drive on the road at night.
    The third best gift the sea gives us is bromine.
    Bromine is also a colored element, which is often in a liquid state, constantly volatilizing red-brown gas. All seawater contains bromine compounds. In addition to seawater, all natural brines on Earth, such as salt lakes and mineral springs, leave behind bromine compounds in the salt residues after evaporation. Bromine is a capable worker in industry: it has its work in photo studios, gasoline companies, pharmacies, dye factories, and many other industrial sectors.
    The fourth best gift the sea gives us is magnesium.
    Magnesium is a lively light metal. In nature, it cannot exist alone and is often combined with other elements. What the sea contains is its compound with chlorine, which is very abundant.
    Metallic magnesium can be obtained by electrolyzing magnesium chloride. Metallic magnesium is an important component of various lightweight and durable alloys. It is easy to burn and emits a strong white light, and it is used to make photoflash bulbs, various signal lights, and fireworks. Its various alloys have a wide range of uses, such as the frames of handcarts, children's cars, typewriters, and cameras; not to mention the parts on airplanes, cars, and various machines.

    大海给我们的礼物
    高士其
    大海是生物的家乡，也是地球上一切元素的归宿地。
    在大海的怀抱里，生长着千奇百怪、种类繁多的海生动植物，可供人们的食用；有的还可以充当肥料，叫做海肥。
    在大海的浪涛里，溶化着一切可能溶解的物质，几乎大陆上的每一种元素，在海水里都能找到它的踪迹。
    据估计，全世界海水的总体积是十三万七千万立方公里。全世界的河流，每年从陆地带到海洋里去的溶解物质，就有三十万万吨之多。无疑的，大海的宝藏是非常丰富的。
    在这些溶解物质之中，连水的原子都算在内，有氧、氢、氯、钠，镁、硫、钾、溴、碳、锶、硼、氟、矽、铷、锂、氮、碘等十七种元素，占海水总重量的99.99％以上，其中以食盐、碘、溴、镁等四种物质，是人类所特别需要从海水中提取出来的。这些就是大海送给我们的最好的礼物。
    大海送给我们最好的礼物之一，是食盐。
    食盐是氯元素和钠元素的化合物。虽然内陆也有一些盐湖和盐井，而海水却是它最丰富的来源。人们把海水引进海滨的盐田，让太阳把水蒸发掉，食盐的结晶体就出现了。
    一般说来，我们每个人的身体里面，都含有十两多的食盐，我们不吃食盐是不行的。此外，食盐还是制造肥皂、玻璃、漂白粉以及许多其他化学工业产品的重要原料。
    大海送给我们最好的礼物之二，是碘。
    碘是带有金属光泽的灰色结晶体，很容易挥发出紫色蒸气。
    地球上不论那块地方，都含有少许的碘；在岩石里、在土壤里、在河流里，都含有碘的成分。动植物和人的身体里，含有更多的碘，而以海水里含的碘最丰富，每一公升海水含碘二毫克。海生动植物，如海藻、海绵、海带之类，都含有大量的碘，每一吨海藻约含有几公斤碘。
    碘对于人体是有救伤治病之功的。它有止血、杀菌、防止伤口感染的能力（但是，用碘过多，也会使人中毒）；它还有促进新陈代谢、防止血管硬化和治疗甲状腺肿的功效。人的身体里，如果缺少碘，就会发生甲状腺肿的症状。
    碘在工业上的用途也很广，碘的有机化合物能不让爱克斯光透射过去，把这种化合物注射到人体组织里，就可以把组织内部特别清晰地照出像来。
    如果我们把一种碘盐加进赛璐珞里，就会阻止光波从各方面透进。这种加了碘盐的赛璐珞片，可以制造非常优良的放大镜，完全可以代替显微镜，尤其是适合于在野外勘探的时候用。如果把加有碘盐的赛璐珞片装在汽车的玻璃窗上，你在夜间马路上行驶的时候，就不会被迎面开来的汽车的灯光迷住眼睛。
    大海送给我们最好的礼物之三，是溴。
    溴也是一种有色的元素，它经常处在液体状态中，不断挥发出红褐色的气体。在所有的海水里，都含有溴的化合物。除了海水以外，地球上一切天然盐水如盐湖和矿泉等，蒸发干了以后，留下来的盐类残渣里，都能找到溴的化合物。溴是工业中一名能手：在照相馆里、在汽油公司里、在药房里、在染料厂里以及在许多其他工业部门，都有它的工作。
    大海送给我们最好的礼物之四，是镁。
    镁是一种活泼的轻金属，在自然界里，它不能单独存在，经常和其他元素化合在一起。在大海里所含有的，却是它和氯的化合物，含量非常丰富。
    氯化镁经过电解，就可以取得金属镁。金属镁是各种轻便而耐用的合金的重要成分。它很容易燃烧发出一种强烈的白光，照相用的镁光灯和各种信号灯以及焰火等，都是用它来制造的。它的各种合金用途很广，如手推车、小儿车、打字机和照相机等的架子，都是它们的制品；至于飞机、汽车和各种机器上面的零件，那更不用说了。
