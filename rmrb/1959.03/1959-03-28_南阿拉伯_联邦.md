South Arabian "Federation"

The South Arabian "Federation" was cobbled together by Britain in February of this year. It includes three sheikhdoms and three sultanates in the Aden region under British control. These are the Beihan Sheikhdom, the Audhali Sultanate, the Fadhli Sultanate, the Dathina Sheikhdom, the Upper Aulaqi Sheikhdom, and the Lower Yafa Sultanate.

Aden is located at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula and is a major British colony in the Middle East. It is of significant strategic importance to British colonial expansion in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula. For a long time, Britain has attempted to strengthen its control over the region by establishing a so-called "federation." However, this plan has been opposed by most of the emirates and sultanates. Despite Britain's various pressures, many emirates and sultanates have refused to join this "federation."

According to Middle Eastern newspapers, the draft treaty of this "federation" stipulates that Britain will continue to maintain absolute control over the politics, economy, and military of the emirates and sultanates participating in the "federation." Britain has the right to station troops in the federation and use its territory and airspace. Therefore, the so-called "federation" is merely a means for Britain to further strengthen its colonial rule over the region. Now, Britain is still trying to finally drag all the sultanates and emirates of the Aden Protectorate into this puppet federation and make it part of the British Commonwealth. The purpose of Britain in organizing this "federation" is, on the one hand, to maintain British rule over the region in disguise and use it as a base for aggression against Arab countries and East Africa; on the other hand, it is also an attempt to permanently and forcibly split these places, weaken and打击打击the Arab national independence movement. William Luce, the British Governor of Aden, bluntly stated that "organizing the 'federation' is to establish a barrier that can attack Yemen from behind."

Britain's activities in cobbling together the "federation" have been widely opposed by the local people. Many tribal leaders and patriotic people have entered the mountains and launched armed struggles against the British colonial authorities, launching multiple attacks against British troops. Although Britain has dispatched reinforcements to intensify its suppression, it has not been able to suppress the anger of the people. (Ya)

### 南阿拉伯“联邦”

    南阿拉伯“联邦”
    南阿拉伯“联邦”是英国在今年2月间拼凑起来的。它包括亚丁地区中受英国控制的三个教长国和三个苏丹国。这就是贝汉教长国、奥扎利苏丹国、费扎利苏丹国、达拉教长国、上奥拉基教长国和下亚菲苏丹国。
    亚丁位于阿拉伯半岛南端，是英国目前在中东的一个主要殖民地。对于英国在波斯湾和阿拉伯半岛殖民扩张具有重要的战略意义。长期以来英国就企图以建立所谓“联邦”来加强对这个地区的控制。但这个计划遭到了大部分酋长国和苏丹国的反对。英国虽然多方面地施加压力，仍然有许多酋长国和苏丹国拒绝参加这个“联邦”。
    据中东报纸揭露，根据这个“联邦”条约草案规定，英国对参加“联邦”的酋长国和苏丹国的政治、经济和军事都继续保持绝对的控制权，英国有权在这个联邦内驻扎军队，使用其领地和领空。因此，所谓“联邦”，不过是英国企图进一步加强对这个地区的殖民统治的手法。现在，英国仍然企图最后把亚丁保护地的全部苏丹国和酋长国拉进这个傀儡联邦之内，并使它成为英联邦的一部分。英国组织这个“联邦”的目的是，一方面借此改头换面地保持英国对这个地区的统治，作为侵略阿拉伯国家和东非的基地；另一方面也是企图永久把这些地方生硬地分裂出来，削弱和打击阿拉伯民族独立运动。亚丁的英国总督威廉·卢斯直言不讳地说，“组织‘联邦’是想要建立一个能够从背后进攻也门的屏障。”
    英国拼凑“联邦”的活动遭到了当地人民广泛的反对。许多部落领袖和爱国人民已经进入山区，和英国殖民当局展开武装斗争，向英国军队展开多次进攻。英国虽然增派援兵加紧镇压，但是并没能压制人民群众的斗争怒火。　　　　　　　　（亚）
