Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The spring fishing season is unfolding with great momentum. Coastal fishermen are full of enthusiasm and are better prepared than in previous years with more boats and gear, determined to achieve a great harvest in the first spring fishing season after the establishment of the people's communes.

Currently, the South China Sea fishing grounds are a bustling scene of thousands of boats competing to catch fish, and the East China Sea spring fishing season has also arrived ahead of schedule; a large number of boats have also set sail early in other coastal areas. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Aquatic Products, more than 40,000 fishing boats have already set sail, and the number is still increasing. The enthusiasm everywhere is very high. Fujian Province plans to catch three million dan of fish during the spring fishing season, doubling the output of the same period last year. The CPC Zhejiang Zhoushan County Committee recently held a swearing-in rally for the spring fishing season in Shenjiamen Fishing Port. At the meeting, the people's communes proposed targets: to catch two million dan of fish in the spring fishing season, more than doubling last year's output. The Shanghai Fisheries Command also concentrated more than 600 boats in Wusong, and the fishermen are eager to launch the first shot of a greater leap forward in the fisheries industry this year.

Large scale, early preparation, and quick action are characteristics of this year's spring fishing season production. After the establishment of the people's communes, the spring fishing season preparation work in various places proceeded quickly and well. In order to expand spring fishing production, many counties in Fujian have specially established procurement agencies for the materials needed for fishing. Some people's communes in Guangdong carried out a "one net per person" campaign, and completed spring fishing preparation work such as repairing boats and mending nets in a timely manner. At present, the people's communes engaged in fisheries in coastal areas have generally formulated fisheries leap forward plans to expand fishing areas, open up new fishing grounds, and increase production.

In order to improve labor productivity, fishermen and fishermen in various places are making full use of production gaps to carry out technical innovations, reform fishing gear, and create and promote various advanced fishing gear. Guangdong requires that the promotion of advanced fishing gear such as trawling, angling, stabbing, and netting be expanded to about 50% to 80%, and the promotion of ball bearings for operating tools should reach 80%. Hongqi People's Commune in Chongming County, Shanghai, has created a simple, easy-to-operate single-anchor purse seine that can operate in deep water and catch small yellow croaker, hairtail, conger eel, shrimp, jellyfish, and other fish in the upper, middle, and lower layers. Among the 198 yellow croaker boats in the county, 147 have been converted to use this type of net. In addition, advanced fishing gear such as all-purpose nets, all-purpose hooks, and fish listening devices are being promoted in various places. In terms of operation methods, various places will widely carry out concurrent and rotational operations and adopt the experience of light netting and quick lifting. Fishing boats in Fujian Province carry more than two kinds of tools each time they go to sea to increase the amount of fish caught per unit and increase the variety of catches.

At present, more and more boats in coastal areas have set sail and are engaged in spring fishing production. According to the situation in Guangdong and Hebei and other places, this year's spring fishing season has come early, the fish schools are relatively dense, and the climatic conditions are good. Coupled with the large organizational strength after the establishment of the people's communes, a bumper harvest is expected.

    迎春汛，万千渔民扬帆出海
    新华社12日讯　海洋春汛大生产正在展开。沿海渔民都鼓足跃进干劲，准备了比往年更多的船只和网具，决心夺取人民公社化后第一个春汛大丰收。
    现在，南海各渔场已出现千帆竞捕鱼群的繁忙景象，东海春季渔汛也已提前到来；其他沿海各地也都有大批船只提前出海。据水产部初步统计，目前出海渔船已达四万多只，还在不断增加。各地的干劲都非常大，福建全省计划春汛中捕鱼三百万担，比去年同期增产一倍。中共浙江舟山县委最近在沈家门渔港召开春汛出洋誓师大会，各人民公社在会上提出指标：要在春汛中捕鱼二百万担，比去年翻一番多。上海市渔捞指挥部也在吴淞集中了六百多条船只，渔民们摩拳擦掌、决心打响今年渔业更大跃进的第一炮。
    规模大、准备早、动手快是今年春汛生产的一个特点。各地在人民公社化后，春汛准备工作进行得又快又好。福建很多县为了扩大春汛生产，专门成立了捕鱼所需物资的采购机构。广东有的人民公社开展了一人一张网运动，及时完成了修船、补网等春汛准备工作。现在，沿海各地经营渔业的人民公社一般都订出了渔业跃进规划，要扩大渔区，开辟新渔场，提高产量。
    为了提高劳动生产率，各地捕鱼工人和渔民们，都正利用生产间隙，大闹技术革新，改革捕捞工具，创造和推广了各种先进的渔具。广东要求把拖、钓、刺、围等多种先进网具的推广面扩大到50％到80％左右，运行工具滚珠轴承化推广面要求达到80％。上海市崇明县红旗人民公社创造了一种操作简便、能进行深水作业的单锚张网，它能捕小黄鱼、带鱼、海鳗、虾、海蜇等上中下三层鱼。全县一百九十八条黄花鱼船中，改用这种网的已有一百四十七条。此外，各地都在推广万能网、万能钩、听鱼器等先进渔具。在作业和操作的方法方面，各地将广泛进行兼作和轮作作业，采取轻网快提的经验。福建省渔船每次都带有两种以上的工具出海，以提高单位捕鱼量，并增加捕捞的品种。
    目前，沿海各地已有越来越多的船只拔锚扬帆，投入春汛生产。根据广东和河北等地情况，今年春汛来得早，鱼群比较密集，气候条件也好，加上人民公社化后组织力量大，估计丰收在望。
