Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 8th. The industrial conference convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China victoriously concluded on the 7th amidst the city-wide red banner competition upsurge across all sectors. Spurred and encouraged by the industrial conference, the city's million industrial workers are now focusing on key production areas, vigorously promoting the technical revolution to ensure the completion of the March national plan and striving towards the even greater leap forward target of increasing the city's total industrial output value by 55% and raising labor productivity by 40% to 50% for the whole year.

During the conference, over 10,000 cadres from the industrial system thoroughly discussed the speeches of Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau, as well as the report by Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. They gained a more profound understanding of the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the tasks of the even greater leap forward this year. They also more deeply recognized Shanghai's responsibility in the national industrialization and the vital significance of resolutely implementing the principle of "the whole nation as a chessboard." During the discussions, the cadres improved their understanding, clarified their direction, and immediately took action to continue implementing the spirit of rectification and vigorously engage in mass movements. During the conference, large and small factories across the city successively held mass meetings, where leaders revealed the bottom line to the masses. Combining the conference with activities outside the conference, combining cadres with the masses, calculating accounts carefully at every level, and setting measures individually, an upsurge of mass movement to greatly air views and discuss the plans for a greater leap forward in industrial production this year was launched. Through extensive and in-depth mass discussions, the potential became greater with calculation, more measures were set, and confidence grew stronger. The Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant aims to double its steel output this year. Original calculations required adding over 1,000 workers and a large amount of equipment. However, under the call to increase production without increasing personnel, with a focus on improving labor productivity, the workers and staff posted over 6,000 big-character posters and proposed hundreds of technical revolution measures. Once all these measures are implemented, the goal of increasing production without increasing personnel and doubling output this year can be achieved. The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant originally planned to increase labor productivity by 40% this year. After discussions by the workers and staff, over a thousand measures were proposed, which could increase labor productivity by 100%. Many cadres deeply felt: "Such accounting truly calculated an aspiration that soars to the sky!"

While discussing the leap forward targets and measures, the city's workers and staff immediately grasped current production, vigorously promoted the technical revolution, and launched a vigorous red banner competition. The workers and staff of the Shanghai Motor Factory have proposed that the output of steam turbine generators and motors in March should exceed the highest monthly output of last year. Each workshop, group, and individual has set targets and measures and are conducting mutual competitions. The Jianhua Electrical Instrument Factory, which has continuously overfulfilled its production plans for the first two months of this year, has launched a competition to further increase its March output by 15%. In the first five days of March, it has already created seven new records, with an average daily output increase of 17% compared to the same period in February. Competitions are also being held between factories and between industries. The workers and staff of the Shanghai electrical machinery industry system have proposed to the metallurgical, machinery, chemical, textile, and light industry systems to launch a friendly competition. The conditions proposed in the initiative not only compare output and quality, but also compare cost and labor productivity. It not only compares the completion of the annual national plan, but also compares the progress on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. The initiative also proposes to compare the communist spirit of "putting others before oneself" and resolutely implement the policy of "the whole nation as a chessboard."

Currently, all sectors of the city are formulating methods for evaluating the red banner competition and conducting regular inspections and evaluations, so that the production competition upsurge will advance wave upon wave.

    大鸣大放讨论国家计划抓紧生产大闹技术革命
    上海百万工人开展红旗竞赛
    层层算细账，个个订措施，潜力愈算愈大，措施愈订愈多
    新华社上海8日电  中共上海市委召开的工业会议，7日在全市各行各业的红旗竞赛热潮中胜利闭幕。全市百万产业工人在工业会议的号召和鼓舞下，正针对当前生产关键大闹技术革命，保证完成3月份国家计划，向全年工业总产值增加55％、劳动生产率提高40％到50％的更大跃进目标奋勇前进。
    会议期间，一万多名工业系统的干部深入细致地讨论了中共中央总书记邓小平同志、政治局委员李富春同志的讲话和市委第一书记柯庆施同志的报告，更加深刻地认识了1958年大跃进的伟大成就和今年更大跃进的任务，更加深刻地认识到上海在全国工业化中所担负的责任和坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的重要意义。干部们在讨论中提高了认识，明确了方向，并且立即行动起来，继续贯彻整风精神，大搞群众运动。在会议期间，全市大小工厂就纷纷召开群众大会，由领导向群众交底。会内和会外相结合，干部和群众相结合，层层算细账，个个订措施，掀起了一个大鸣大放讨论今年工业生产更大跃进规划的群众运动。经过广泛深入的群众性的讨论，潜力愈算愈大，措施愈订愈多，信心愈来愈足。上钢二厂今年钢材产量要翻一番，原来计算要增加一千多名工人和大批设备；但是，职工群众在以提高劳动生产率为中心、增产不增人的号召下，贴出六千多张大字报，提出了几百条技术革命的措施，这些措施全部实现后，可以实现今年增产不增人、产量翻一番的目标。上海机床厂原定今年提高劳动生产率40％，经职工群众讨论后，提出上千条措施，使劳动生产率可以提高100％。许多干部深有体会地说：“这样的算账真是算出了冲天干劲”。
    全市职工在讨论跃进指标、措施的同时，立即抓住当前生产，大搞技术革命，轰轰烈烈地开展红旗竞赛。上海电机厂职工们已经提出3月份的汽轮发电机和电动机的产量要超过去年最高月产量，各车间、小组和个人都订出指标和措施，相互开展竞赛。今年头两个月都连续超额完成生产计划的建华电工仪表厂，为了把3月份产量再提高15％，已经开展竞赛，3月份头五天中就创造七个新纪录，平均日产量比2月同期提高17％。厂与厂之间、行业与行业之间也开展了红旗竞赛。上海电机工业系统职工已向冶金、机械、化工、纺织、轻工业等系统职工提出了开展友谊竞赛的倡议。倡议中提出的条件，不仅要比产量、质量，也要比成本、比劳动生产率。不仅要比完成全年国家计划，也要比按日按周按月的进度。倡议书还提出要比“先人后己”的共产主义协作精神，坚决执行“全国一盘棋”的方针。
    目前，全市各行各业正在制订红旗竞赛评比的办法，按期检查评比，让生产竞赛高潮一浪高一浪地向前推进。
