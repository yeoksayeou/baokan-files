    Closely Integrating Production, Flexibly Arranging Time
    Qingdao Local Building Materials Company Achieves Remarkable Success in Workers' Spare-Time Education

    (Our dispatch) Qingdao Local Building Materials Company, in leading workers' spare-time cultural education, has adopted various forms such as combining teaching methods with production methods, and combining teaching content with production needs. This not only improved the cultural and technical level of the workers but also powerfully promoted production.

    Originally, the cultural level of the company's workers was very low. Among the 3,663 employees, 92% were illiterate or semi-literate. Now, this situation has changed. Except for a few newly recruited workers, there is not a single illiterate person in the entire company. Currently, the company has established literacy consolidation classes, elementary school classes, junior high school classes, senior high school classes, university classes, and specialized training classes. 2,491 employees are participating in the studies, accounting for 97.5% of the number of young and middle-aged people who should be enrolled, creating a new high tide of cultural learning throughout the company.

    The production of Qingdao Local Building Materials Company is very decentralized, and the seasonality of production is very large, with shutdowns in the off-season and intensive production in the peak season. The production organization is not fixed, and there are often five types of shifts in one production process. Based on these characteristics of production, the teaching forms and teaching time of workers' spare-time education have adopted a combination of unified regulations and flexible arrangements. The company's Party General Branch uniformly stipulates that six hours per week should be used as the cultural education time for employees. In terms of teaching forms, a combination of centralized classes and decentralized classes, and a combination of classes and tutoring, are adopted. Centralized teaching is used under normal production conditions, where teachers gather students by grade for classes, and then small teachers conduct tutoring in groups. When production is tight in some factories and workshops, the method of teaching alongside work shifts is adopted, with teachers teaching whenever workers get off work. During the winter slack season when production stops and most workers return to the countryside, the "learn on the kang after work stoppage" method is adopted. The specific approach is that before the work stoppage, teachers first assign the study and homework for the period of the work stoppage to the students, and then form study groups with workers from the same village and nearby villages, selecting a group leader for each group, and students with higher levels of education as small teachers. Each group uses the five market days to exchange learning progress and urge each other to learn. Students report their learning progress to the company by correspondence, and the company also plans to send teachers to the countryside to conduct inspections and supervision of students' learning through "family visits". This method not only ensures the learning of workers during the winter work stoppage but also greatly strengthens the close ties between workers and leaders, and between students and teachers. Because these methods have been implemented, the company has never experienced a suspension or interruption since it started workers' spare-time education in 1953, and the attendance rate of students has consistently remained above 95%.

    At the same time, the company's workers' spare-time cultural education is also closely integrated with production, coordinating with the central work and political movements. For example, when promoting the experience of the "53 kiln firing method", some older workers encountered resistance in the promotion work because they did not understand this experience. At this time, the teachers brought up the "air" lesson in the literacy textbook to teach at this time, helping workers to quickly accept this experience. Last year, when the company was processing granite for construction in the capital, the workers could not accurately grasp the specifications of the stone materials because they did not understand mathematics. At this time, the teachers integrated algebra, geometry, general mathematical methods for calculating volumes, and basic knowledge of drawing, and compiled teaching materials, adopting the method of teaching while doing. As a result, the production workers quickly mastered the calculation methods and ensured the quality of production. In addition, the teachers also compiled more than 80 articles related to the superiority of the people's communes to integrate into the teaching. Since last year, the teachers of the company's spare-time school have successively compiled more than a dozen such teaching materials, powerfully coordinating with production and political movements.

    In the past year alone, due to the improvement of workers' cultural level, more than 1,100 suggestions for production technology reform and tool improvement have been put forward. Worker Wang Xinyuan, who had just shed his illiterate status, also created the "high-temperature shed" for high-temperature kiln loading last year, reducing the temperature from 85 to 90 degrees Celsius to 32 to 36 degrees Celsius, increasing labor productivity by 80%. After learning culture, workers can now write big-character posters, material requisition forms, and production plans. They can also use the cultural knowledge they have learned to improve production tools and reform technical operations. Currently, the company has decided to further systematically teach workers political, technical, and cultural theoretical knowledge on the basis of the original spare-time school to adapt to the needs of further development of production.

    密切结合生产　灵活安排时间
    青岛地方建筑材料公司职工业余教育办得很出色
    本报讯　青岛市地方建筑材料公司，在领导职工业余文化教育中，采取教学形式和生产形式相结合；教学内容和生产需要相结合等多种形式，不仅提高了职工文化技术水平，还有力地推动了生产。
    原来，这个公司职工的文化水平很低，三千六百六十三名职工，文盲和半文盲占92％。现在，这种状况已经改变，除个别新吸收的职工外，全公司没有一个文盲。目前，这个公司已设立了扫盲巩固班、高小班、初中班、高中班、大学班和专科班，参加学习的职工有二千四百九十一名，占青壮年应入学数的97.5％，使整个公司出现了学习文化的新高潮。
    青岛市地方建筑材料公司的生产非常分散，生产的季节性很大，淡季停工、旺季突击，生产组织不固定，一种生产过程，往往就有五种类型的班次。根据生产上的这些特点，职工业余教育的教学形式和教学时间，采取了统一规定和灵活安排相结合的办法。公司党总支统一规定每周以六小时作为职工的文化教育时间。在教学形式上，采取了集中上课和分散上课相结合、上课和辅导相结合的办法。集中授课是在生产正常的情况下采用的，由教师按年级把学员集中起来上课，然后再由小先生分组进行辅导。在部分厂、车间生产紧张时，采取了跟班教学的办法，工人什么时间下班，教师就什么时候教；冬闲停工期间，大部分工人返回农村，这时又采用了“停工炕头学”的办法。具体作法是，在停工以前，教师首先把停工期间的学习和作业布置给学员，然后把同村和附近村庄的职工组成学习组，每组选出组长，文化程度较高的学员为小先生；各组利用五天赶集的日子，互相交流学习情况和督促学习进度；学员用通信办法把学习情况汇报给公司，公司也有计划派出教师分赴农村，用“家庭走访”的办法来对学员的学习进行检查督促。这种办法不仅可以使工人冬季停工期间的学习得到保证，而且大大加强了工人与领导、学员与教师的密切联系。因为实行了这些办法，这个公司从1953年开办职工业余教育以来，从来没有停办或中断现象，而且学员的出勤率一直保持在95％以上。
    同时，这个公司的职工业余文化教育，还紧密结合了生产，配合了中心工作和政治运动。例如，在推广“五三烧窑法”经验时，有些老工人由于不了解这种经验，推广工作中遇到了阻力。这时，教师们就把识字课本中的“空气”一课提到这时教，帮助工人迅速接受了这一经验。去年这个公司在加工首都建筑用的花岗石时，由于职工们不懂数学，不能精确掌握石料规格，这时，教师们就综合了代数、几何和一般数学的计算体积方法及制图基础等知识，编写出教材，采取边教边做的办法，进行教学。结果，生产工人就迅速掌握了计算方法，保证了生产质量。另外，教师们还编写出有关人民公社优越性等课文八十余件，来插穿教学。从去年以来，这个公司业余学校的教师先后编写出这样的教材十多种，有力地配合了生产和政治运动。
    去年一年，由于工人提高了文化水平，而提出的生产技术改革和改进工具的建议，就有一千一百多件。刚摘掉文盲帽子的工人王信远，去年还创造了高温装窑的“高温棚”，把温度由八十五到九十度降到三十二到三十六度，使劳动生产率提高了80％。工人学了文化以后，现在都能写大字报、领料单、生产计划，也可以用学到的文化知识来改进生产工具，改革技术操作。目前，这个公司已决定在原有业余学校的基础上进一步系统地向职工讲授政治、技术和文化理论知识，以适应生产进一步发展的需要。
