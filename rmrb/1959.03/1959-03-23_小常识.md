    Cotton High Ridge Cultivation Method: On deeply ploughed land, cultivate the soil to make ridges, generally 8 inches high, 3 feet wide at the base, 2 feet wide at the top, and 5 inches wide at the bottom of the ditch. In this way, two rows of cotton can be planted on each ridge with a row spacing of 1 foot 2 inches, and the row spacing of cotton seedlings between two high ridges is 2 feet 3 inches. The ridge ditch serves as a channel for both irrigation and drainage.
    Sunken Shed Heated Seedling Raising Method: On the ground, build a semi-enclosure wall, 3 feet high, 6 feet long from east to west, and 3 feet wide from north to south, in the shape of a dustpan facing south. Then, on the sunny land inside the enclosure, turn the soil 5 inches deep to create a warm bed. Under the warm bed, dig a "two dragons playing with a spider" style overheating channel with a cotton firewood-covered top. In the middle, create a straight fire channel that passes through the overheating channel for burning fuel. In this way, mix 100 jin of fine soil with 1 jin of superphosphate, 40 jin of horse manure powder, and 1 jin of ammonium sulfate, add water to make mud, and form nutrient pots. Place the nutrient pots on the warm bed, sow cotton seeds, cover with straw curtains, burn a small fire three times a day, and sprinkle water frequently to maintain a soil temperature of around 15 degrees Celsius. After a few days, the cotton seedlings will emerge and grow, ready to be transplanted onto the high ridges in the cotton fields.

    棉花高垅栽培法：在深翻的土地上培土打垅，一般垅高八寸，底宽三尺，顶宽二尺，沟底宽五寸。这样，每垅上面可种行距一尺二寸的两行棉花，两个高垅之间棉苗的行距是二尺三寸。垅沟通渠道，既可浇水，又可排水。
    阳畦加温育苗法：在地面上打一个高三尺、东西长六丈、南北宽三尺、座北朝南的簸箕形的半围墙，然后在围墙向阳的土地上，翻五寸深，作为温炕，温炕的下边，挖一个用棉柴棚顶的“二龙戏蛛式”的过热道，中间打一个直通过热道的烧火道，作为烧火用。这样就把一百斤细土和一斤过磷酸钙、四十斤马粪粉、一斤硫酸铵加水混合成泥作成的营养钵，放在温炕上，种下棉籽，用草帘盖上，每天烧三次小火，经常洒水，保持地温在十五度左右，几天之后，棉苗便出土生长起来，可移栽到棉田高垅上。
