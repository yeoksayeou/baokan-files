　　The First "March 8th" International Women's Day

　　Fifty years ago today, on March 8, 1909, under the influence of Clara Zetkin, a leader of working women, female workers in the American textile and garment industries held large-scale strikes and demonstrations to fight for equal rights between men and women and demand wage increases. The female workers in Chicago, USA, further demanded an eight-hour workday and the right to vote. Their resolute and powerful actions were warmly received by the broad masses of working women in the United States, and also influenced the active actions of women around the world. This was the first sign of working women showing their strength.

　　In 1910, at the Second International Socialist Women's Conference held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, Zetkin proposed that March 8 be designated as International Women's Day. This proposal was immediately endorsed by the participants. In 1911, to commemorate the first "March 8th" International Women's Day, working women in Germany, the United States, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and other countries enthusiastically held demonstrations. Austria's scale was the largest, with 80,000 female workers participating in the demonstration in the capital Vienna. Since then, "March 8th" has become a historically traditional festival.

　　Chinese women first held a commemoration of "March 8th" during the first period of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1924. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the laboring women of Guangzhou, together with women from all walks of life who were oppressed, held a memorial meeting in Zhongshan Park. They put forward slogans such as "Down with imperialism," "Down with warlords," "Equal pay for equal work," "Protect child laborers and pregnant women," "Prohibit child brides and polygamy," "Prohibit keeping maids and concubines," and "Establish a child protection law," and marched in formation.

    第一个“三八”节
    五十年前的今天，1909年3月8日，美国纺织业和服装业的女工，在劳动妇女领袖克拉拉·蔡特金的影响下，为争取男女平等待遇，要求增加工资，举行了大规模的罢工与示威游行。美国芝加哥的女工们更提出八小时工作日与选举权的要求。他们坚决有力的行动得到美国广大劳动妇女的热烈响应，同时也影响到全世界妇女的积极行动。这是劳动妇女显示自己力量的先声。
    1910年，蔡特金在丹麦首都哥本哈根举行的第二次国际社会主义妇女大会上提议：规定3月8日为国际妇女节，这一提议立即得到与会者的一致拥护。1911年，纪念第一个“三八”国际妇女节这一天，德、美、奥、瑞典、丹麦等国的劳动妇女都热烈举行示威游行，其中以奥国的规模为最大，在首都维也纳有八万女工参加了示威游行。此后，“三八”节便成为富有历史性的传统节日。
    中国妇女第一次举行纪念“三八”节是在1924年第一次国共合作时期。在中国共产党领导下，广州的劳动妇女联合各界被压迫妇女，在中山公园举行纪念会。提出“打倒帝国主义”、“打倒军阀”、“同工同酬”、“保护童工孕妇”、“禁止童养媳多妻制”、“禁止蓄婢纳妾”、“建立儿童保护法”等口号，并列队游行。　　（培熙）（附图片）
