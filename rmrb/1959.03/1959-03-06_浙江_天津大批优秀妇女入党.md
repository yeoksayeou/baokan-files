Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 5th: Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Zhejiang Province has admitted more than 10,500 outstanding women into the Chinese Communist Party, accounting for over 27.2% of the total number of existing women Party members in the province.

These newly admitted women Communist Party members are all outstanding fighters on various fronts, especially the industrial and agricultural fronts. Among the 230 women Party members newly admitted in Hangzhou last year, those on the industrial front accounted for 41.3%, those on the agricultural front accounted for 40%, those on the cultural, educational, and health fronts accounted for 12.6%, and those on the commercial, transportation, and other fronts accounted for 6.1%. Among these new Party members, 82 were评为评为(rated as) socialist construction activists at the provincial and municipal levels, and the vast majority of the others were also advanced elements who had received various awards.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th: From the "March 8th" International Women's Day last year to the beginning of March this year, more than 5,800 women in Tianjin gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

These more than 5,000 new Party members are all outstanding elements on various fronts. Under the cultivation and education of the Party organization, their political consciousness has continuously improved, and they have made outstanding achievements in production and work. Su Zhian, a new Party member and reed worker at the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, was a model worker in Tianjin in 1957. Last year, she again completed her production plan in a comprehensive and balanced manner, with the highest output in the entire workshop, and was therefore again named a city-wide model worker in 1958.
