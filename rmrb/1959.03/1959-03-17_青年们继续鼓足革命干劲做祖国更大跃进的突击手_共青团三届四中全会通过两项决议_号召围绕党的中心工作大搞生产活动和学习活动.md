Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The full text is as follows:

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China was held in Beijing from February 23 to March 7, 1959.

During the meeting, leading comrades from the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee met with the attending comrades, gave important instructions on the work of the Communist Youth League, and gave great encouragement and strength to the attending comrades.

The main topics of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the League were to summarize the experiences of the League and youth work in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and to discuss the tasks and work of the League in industrial and agricultural production and organizing youth learning in the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward of socialist construction in our country in 1959. The meeting passed the "Resolution on Mobilizing Youths Throughout the Country to Strive for the Greater Leap Forward in Industrial and Agricultural Production in 1959" and the "Resolution on Actively Organizing Youth's Spare-Time Learning." Comrade Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, made a summary of the meeting.

The plenary session believes that 1958 was a year of unprecedentedly high revolutionary enthusiasm among the youth of our country. Under the wise leadership of the Party and the encouragement of the General Line, the youth of the whole country became the most active shock force in realizing the various indicators of the Great Leap Forward, and they have been well-trained in overcoming various difficulties. The exemplary role of the League members and the combat effectiveness of the League organizations have been further improved. At present, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are striving to consolidate the people's communes and to realize the 1959 national economic construction plan centered on the four major leap forward indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. The Communist Youth League organizations must, under the unified leadership and overall arrangement of the Party, fully promote the various successful experiences of 1958, continue to boost the revolutionary enthusiasm of the youth, and carry out large-scale production and learning activities centered on the Party's central work, to further give play to the shock role and vanguard role of the broad masses of youth on all fronts, and contribute their strength to the greater leap forward in socialist construction in 1959.

The plenary session pointed out that League organizations at all levels must further strengthen the political and ideological work for the youth, first of all, to strengthen the propaganda and education of the situation and tasks, deeply publicize the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Party's various specific policies, and in conjunction with the 1959 national economic plan, mobilize the whole League and the broad masses of youth to launch a high tide of discussing the construction situation and tasks, to raise the awareness of the youth, boost the greater enthusiasm of the youth, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. At the same time, since the struggle between the two roads has not completely ended, strengthening socialist and communist ideological education and eliminating the ideological influence of capitalism and individualism is a long-term task. Therefore, in ideological work, we must continue to implement the policy of "promoting proletarian ideology and eradicating bourgeois ideology." At present, we should vigorously strengthen the youth's labor education, collectivist spirit education, and communist style education. Cultivate young people to become selfless workers, selfless, able to endure hardship, abide by discipline, be brave in creation, and fearless of difficulties. In ideological work, the League must adhere to the mass line method of persuasion and education, grasp typical examples, vigorously commend and publicize advanced individuals, advocate specific analysis, correctly carry out ideological debates, be good at conducting necessary criticism and ideological struggle, and make the work more thorough and meticulous.

The plenary session pointed out with full confidence that under the system of people's communes being universally established in the countryside and the situation of a new and greater leap forward, there is much that the League can do, and there are many things that should be done and can be done. As long as the whole League unswervingly focuses on the central work of the Party and carries out various activities in a planned and correct way, it will surely greatly unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm of the youth, and it will surely achieve results. The whole League must realize that, under the leadership of the Party, actively organizing the youth to participate in labor competitions, participate in technical revolution, and constantly set off a competition upsurge of comparing with the advanced, comparing more, faster, better, and more economically, so as to give play to the shock role and vanguard role of the youth in accelerating socialist construction, is a regular and important work of the Communist Youth League organization.

The plenary session also pointed out that the League organization should be good at, under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the Party, earnestly doing a good job in ideological work and organizational work, mobilizing the youth to complete various tasks together with adults and the elderly; at the same time, it should also be good at, in accordance with the principle conducive to the development of production, adapting to the characteristics of the youth, using rich, colorful, flexible and diverse organizational forms, grasping the more difficult and urgent work in production and the new technologies that need to be promoted, and actively organizing the youth to carry out various necessary shock activities. Many good organizational forms and working methods created in the past, such as youth shock brigades, youth thrift teams, etc., have achieved good results. The recently emerged activity of striving to be red flag shock brigaders has begun to have a positive impact among the youth in many regions. The League organization should attach importance to summarizing the experience in this area and strengthen leadership. The youth's production activities must closely serve the needs of current production. At present, we should seize the opportunity to launch activities among the youth on the industrial front to increase production and improve quality, save raw materials, become versatile multi-skilled workers, and train outstanding apprentices; and launch activities among the youth on the agricultural front to achieve large-scale high yields of various crops, reform tools and conduct scientific and technological experiments, love and protect livestock, and plant trees and afforest.

The plenary session also pointed out that while leading the youth to engage in large-scale production activities, League organizations at all levels should also organize the youth's learning with great enthusiasm, which is a task of strategic significance for the Communist Youth League organization. Among the 130 million youths in our country, a part are employed intellectuals, about 5 million, who should continue to strengthen labor training and go deep into grassroots work, which is a major measure to promote their healthy growth. Another part are youths in school, about 10 million, whose task is to study hard, learn productive labor, closely integrate teacher-student relations, cultivate a realistic style of study, and continue to implement the Party's education policy, to achieve a double harvest of learning and labor. The largest part is the youth working and producing on their jobs, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of youths, who need to master and improve their cultural and scientific knowledge level through spare-time learning. Organizing youth's spare-time learning should adopt the policy of active leadership and proper arrangement, and carry out work under the principle of focusing on production and comprehensively arranging production, learning, and rest. The plenary session calls on the youth of the whole country to study diligently, work hard, and unswervingly climb to the peaks of culture and science, to meet the needs of accelerating socialist construction.

The plenary session unanimously believes that the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the work of the League in 1958 once again proves that the leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee for giving play to the organizational role of the League. Guaranteeing the absolute leadership of the Party and giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the League are consistent. The more closely the League organizations and the League cadres obtain the close leadership of the Party, the more they can get the Party's care and support, and the more actively and vigorously the League's work can be carried out. League committees at all levels should promptly ask for instructions and report to the Party committees in various tasks, and more actively carry out work. All League cadres should often and conscientiously study and delve into the Party's instructions, and for the tasks proposed by the Party, they should follow quickly, follow closely, and follow well. The plenary session requires League committees at all levels to attach greater importance to strengthening grassroots work, training League cadres, improving the activity capacity of branches and groups, and systematically absorbing the young activists who have emerged since the Great Leap Forward and who meet the standards of League members into the League ranks.

Eighty-six members of the Central Committee of the League and thirty-four alternate members attended the meeting.

    青年们继续鼓足革命干劲做祖国更大跃进的突击手
    共青团三届四中全会通过两项决议
    号召围绕党的中心工作大搞生产活动和学习活动
    新华社16日讯　共青团三届四中全会公报。全文如下：
    中国共产主义青年团第三届中央委员会第四次全体会议于1959年2月23日至3月7日在北京举行。
    会议期间，中共中央书记处的领导同志会见了到会同志，对共青团工作作了重要指示，给了到会同志以很大的鼓舞和力量。
    团的三届四中全会的主要议题，是根据党的八届六中全会的精神，总结1958年大跃进中团和青年工作的经验，讨论在1959年我国社会主义建设更大更好更全面的跃进中，团在工农业生产和组织青年学习方面的任务和工作。会议通过了关于动员全国青年为实现1959年工农业生产更大跃进而奋斗的决议和关于积极组织青年业余学习的决议。团中央第一书记胡耀邦同志作了会议的总结。
    全会认为，1958年是我国青年革命干劲空前高涨的一年。全国青年在党的英明领导和总路线的指引鼓舞下，成为实现大跃进各项指标的一支最积极活跃的突击力量，并且在战胜各种困难中受到了良好的锻炼，团员的模范作用和团组织的战斗力都进一步提高了。现在，全国人民在党的领导下正在为整顿巩固人民公社，为实现以钢、煤、粮、棉四大跃进指标为中心的1959年国民经济建设计划而努力奋斗。共青团组织必须在党的统一领导和全面安排下，充分发扬1958年各种成功的经验，继续鼓足青年的革命干劲，围绕党的中心工作大搞生产活动和学习活动，进一步发挥广大青年在各个战线上的突击作用和先锋作用，在1959年社会主义建设的更大跃进中贡献出自己的力量。
    全会指出，团的各级组织必须进一步加强对青年的政治思想工作，首先是加强形势和任务的宣传教育，深入宣传党的八届六中全会的精神和党的各项具体政策，并结合1959年的国民经济计划，发动全团和广大青年，掀起一个讨论建设形势和任务的热潮，以提高青年的觉悟，鼓起青年的更大干劲，为完成和超额完成1959年的国民经济计划而斗争。同时，由于两条道路的斗争还没有完全结束，而加强社会主义和共产主义思想教育，清除资本主义、个人主义的思想影响更是一个长期的任务。因此，在思想工作上必须继续贯彻“兴无灭资”的方针。目前应当大力加强青年的劳动教育、集体主义精神教育和共产主义风格的教育。培养青年成为忘我劳动、大公无私、吃苦耐劳、遵守纪律、勇于创造、不畏艰险的坚强战士。在思想工作中团必须坚持说服教育的群众路线的方法，抓住典型，大力表扬和宣传先进，提倡具体分析，正确开展思想辩论，善于进行必要的批评和思想斗争，把工作做得更深入更细致。
    全会满怀信心的指出，在农村人民公社制度普遍建立和新的更大跃进的形势下，团的工作是大有可为，应做和可做的事情多得很。全团只要坚定不移地围绕党的中心工作，有计划地正确地开展各种各样的活动，就一定会极大地发挥青年的革命干劲，就一定会做出成绩。全团必须认识到，在党的领导下，积极组织青年参加劳动竞赛，参加技术革命，不断掀起比先进比多快好省的竞赛热潮，以发挥青年在加速社会主义建设中的突击作用和先锋作用，是共青团组织一项经常的重要工作。
    全会又指出，团的组织要善于在党的统一领导和统一部署下，切实做好思想工作和组织工作，发动青年同成年人、老年人一起去完成各项任务；同时，还要善于按照有利于发展生产的原则，适应青年的特点，运用丰富多彩、灵活多样的组织形式，抓住生产中比较困难的紧急的工作和需要推广的新技术，积极组织青年进行各种必要的突击活动。过去各地所创造的许多很好的组织形式和工作方法，如青年突击队、青年节约队等，都收到了很好的效果，最近出现的争取做红旗突击手的活动已经开始在不少地区的青年中产生了积极的影响。团的组织应当重视总结这方面的经验，加强领导。青年的生产活动必须密切服务于当前生产的需要，现在应当抓紧在工业战线上发动青年开展高产优质活动、节约原材料活动、一专多能的多面手活动、优秀徒工活动，在农业战线上发动青年开展多种农作物的大面积丰产活动、工具改革和科学技术试验活动、爱畜保畜活动、造林绿化活动等。
    全会还指出，各级团的组织在带领青年大搞生产活动的同时，还要以极大热情去组织青年的学习，这是共青团组织一项带有战略意义的任务。我国一亿三千万青年，一部分是在职的知识青年，约有五百万人，应当继续加强劳动锻炼，深入基层工作，这是促进他们健全成长的重大措施。另一部分是在学的青年，约有一千万人，他们的任务是努力学习功课，学习生产劳动，密切师生关系，养成实事求是的学风，继续贯彻党的教育方针，达到学习、劳动双丰收。最大的部分是占青年总数90％以上的在工作和生产岗位上的青年，需要通过业余学习的途径，去掌握和提高文化科学知识水平。组织青年的业余学习，应当采取积极领导，妥善安排的方针，在以生产为中心，生产、学习、休息全面安排的原则下进行工作。全会号召，全国青年要勤奋学习、刻苦钻研，坚韧不拔地登上文化、科学的高峰，以适应加速社会主义建设的需要。
    全会一致认为，1958年团的工作大跃进的经验又一次证明，党的领导是发挥团的组织作用的最根本的保证。保证党的绝对领导，和发挥团的积极性、主动性，是一致的。团的组织和团的干部愈是取得党的密切领导，就愈能得到党的关怀和支持，团的工作也就能够更加主动、更加生动活泼地开展起来。各级团委在各项工作中应向党委及时请示汇报，更加主动的去进行工作。全团干部应当经常认真地学习和钻研党的指示，对党提出来的任务，要跟得快、跟得紧、跟得好。全会要求各级团委更加重视加强基层工作，训练团的干部，提高支部、小组的活动能力，有计划地把大跃进以来涌现出的合乎团员标准的青年积极分子，吸收到团的队伍中来。
    出席这次会议的，有团中央委员八十六人；候补委员三十四人。
