Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Communiqu√© of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The full text is as follows:

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China was held in Beijing from February 23 to March 7, 1959.

During the meeting, leading comrades from the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee met with the attending comrades, gave important instructions on the work of the Communist Youth League, and gave great encouragement and strength to the attending comrades.

The main topics of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the League were to summarize the experiences of the League and youth work in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and to discuss the tasks and work of the League in industrial and agricultural production and organizing youth learning in the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward of socialist construction in our country in 1959. The meeting passed the "Resolution on Mobilizing Youths Throughout the Country to Strive for the Greater Leap Forward in Industrial and Agricultural Production in 1959" and the "Resolution on Actively Organizing Youth's Spare-Time Learning." Comrade Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, made a summary of the meeting.

The plenary session believes that 1958 was a year of unprecedentedly high revolutionary enthusiasm among the youth of our country. Under the wise leadership of the Party and the encouragement of the General Line, the youth of the whole country became the most active shock force in realizing the various indicators of the Great Leap Forward, and they have been well-trained in overcoming various difficulties. The exemplary role of the League members and the combat effectiveness of the League organizations have been further improved. At present, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are striving to consolidate the people's communes and to realize the 1959 national economic construction plan centered on the four major leap forward indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. The Communist Youth League organizations must, under the unified leadership and overall arrangement of the Party, fully promote the various successful experiences of 1958, continue to boost the revolutionary enthusiasm of the youth, and carry out large-scale production and learning activities centered on the Party's central work, to further give play to the shock role and vanguard role of the broad masses of youth on all fronts, and contribute their strength to the greater leap forward in socialist construction in 1959.

The plenary session pointed out that League organizations at all levels must further strengthen the political and ideological work for the youth, first of all, to strengthen the propaganda and education of the situation and tasks, deeply publicize the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Party's various specific policies, and in conjunction with the 1959 national economic plan, mobilize the whole League and the broad masses of youth to launch a high tide of discussing the construction situation and tasks, to raise the awareness of the youth, boost the greater enthusiasm of the youth, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. At the same time, since the struggle between the two roads has not completely ended, strengthening socialist and communist ideological education and eliminating the ideological influence of capitalism and individualism is a long-term task. Therefore, in ideological work, we must continue to implement the policy of "promoting proletarian ideology and eradicating bourgeois ideology." At present, we should vigorously strengthen the youth's labor education, collectivist spirit education, and communist style education. Cultivate young people to become selfless workers, selfless, able to endure hardship, abide by discipline, be brave in creation, and fearless of difficulties. In ideological work, the League must adhere to the mass line method of persuasion and education, grasp typical examples, vigorously commend and publicize advanced individuals, advocate specific analysis, correctly carry out ideological debates, be good at conducting necessary criticism and ideological struggle, and make the work more thorough and meticulous.

The plenary session pointed out with full confidence that under the system of people's communes being universally established in the countryside and the situation of a new and greater leap forward, there is much that the League can do, and there are many things that should be done and can be done. As long as the whole League unswervingly focuses on the central work of the Party and carries out various activities in a planned and correct way, it will surely greatly unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm of the youth, and it will surely achieve results. The whole League must realize that, under the leadership of the Party, actively organizing the youth to participate in labor competitions, participate in technical revolution, and constantly set off a competition upsurge of comparing with the advanced, comparing more, faster, better, and more economically, so as to give play to the shock role and vanguard role of the youth in accelerating socialist construction, is a regular and important work of the Communist Youth League organization.

The plenary session also pointed out that the League organization should be good at, under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the Party, earnestly doing a good job in ideological work and organizational work, mobilizing the youth to complete various tasks together with adults and the elderly; at the same time, it should also be good at, in accordance with the principle conducive to the development of production, adapting to the characteristics of the youth, using rich, colorful, flexible and diverse organizational forms, grasping the more difficult and urgent work in production and the new technologies that need to be promoted, and actively organizing the youth to carry out various necessary shock activities. Many good organizational forms and working methods created in the past, such as youth shock brigades, youth thrift teams, etc., have achieved good results. The recently emerged activity of striving to be red flag shock brigaders has begun to have a positive impact among the youth in many regions. The League organization should attach importance to summarizing the experience in this area and strengthen leadership. The youth's production activities must closely serve the needs of current production. At present, we should seize the opportunity to launch activities among the youth on the industrial front to increase production and improve quality, save raw materials, become versatile multi-skilled workers, and train outstanding apprentices; and launch activities among the youth on the agricultural front to achieve large-scale high yields of various crops, reform tools and conduct scientific and technological experiments, love and protect livestock, and plant trees and afforest.

The plenary session also pointed out that while leading the youth to engage in large-scale production activities, League organizations at all levels should also organize the youth's learning with great enthusiasm, which is a task of strategic significance for the Communist Youth League organization. Among the 130 million youths in our country, a part are employed intellectuals, about 5 million, who should continue to strengthen labor training and go deep into grassroots work, which is a major measure to promote their healthy growth. Another part are youths in school, about 10 million, whose task is to study hard, learn productive labor, closely integrate teacher-student relations, cultivate a realistic style of study, and continue to implement the Party's education policy, to achieve a double harvest of learning and labor. The largest part is the youth working and producing on their jobs, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of youths, who need to master and improve their cultural and scientific knowledge level through spare-time learning. Organizing youth's spare-time learning should adopt the policy of active leadership and proper arrangement, and carry out work under the principle of focusing on production and comprehensively arranging production, learning, and rest. The plenary session calls on the youth of the whole country to study diligently, work hard, and unswervingly climb to the peaks of culture and science, to meet the needs of accelerating socialist construction.

The plenary session unanimously believes that the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the work of the League in 1958 once again proves that the leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee for giving play to the organizational role of the League. Guaranteeing the absolute leadership of the Party and giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the League are consistent. The more closely the League organizations and the League cadres obtain the close leadership of the Party, the more they can get the Party's care and support, and the more actively and vigorously the League's work can be carried out. League committees at all levels should promptly ask for instructions and report to the Party committees in various tasks, and more actively carry out work. All League cadres should often and conscientiously study and delve into the Party's instructions, and for the tasks proposed by the Party, they should follow quickly, follow closely, and follow well. The plenary session requires League committees at all levels to attach greater importance to strengthening grassroots work, training League cadres, improving the activity capacity of branches and groups, and systematically absorbing the young activists who have emerged since the Great Leap Forward and who meet the standards of League members into the League ranks.

Eighty-six members of the Central Committee of the League and thirty-four alternate members attended the meeting.
