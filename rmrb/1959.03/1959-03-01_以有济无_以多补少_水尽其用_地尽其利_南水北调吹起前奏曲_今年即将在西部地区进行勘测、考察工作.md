Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Western Region South-to-North Water Diversion Investigation and Planning Work Conference recently held in Beijing decided to mobilize all forces, give full play to the spirit of collaboration, unify arrangements, divide responsibilities, and conduct investigation, survey, and research work on the South-to-North Water Diversion in the western region, to provide necessary data for future planning and design. The conference also initially drafted the 1959 investigation work plan for the South-to-North Water Diversion in the western region. From this point on, the first phase of larger-scale survey, comprehensive investigation, scientific research, and other work for the South-to-North Water Diversion is about to officially begin.

This conference was jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power from February 16th to 21st. Representatives from more than sixty units attended the conference, including relevant research units of the Comprehensive Survey Committee and the Department of Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Water Conservancy Research, the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and relevant provinces such as Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, and Sichuan, relevant departments of the Central Government, and relevant universities.

Our country is one of the countries in the world with very abundant runoff resources. According to rough estimates by relevant parties: the total water demand for farmland irrigation and land reclamation, the development of forestry and animal husbandry, and the supply of water for industry and navigation in the country is less than the surface runoff. However, the distribution of water quantity and hydropower is very uneven across regions, with approximately three-quarters or more distributed in the Yangtze River and its southern regions, while the vast northwest region, the Inner Mongolia grassland area, and the Yellow River basin region do not have sufficient water resources to meet the water demand of the land, and there are contradictions between irrigation and hydropower development. Therefore, balancing the water volume between the north and the south is of great significance for improving agricultural production in the northern and northwestern regions of our country, developing the resources of these regions, and enabling the common and rapid surge in the development of industry and agriculture throughout the country. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on water conservancy work last August, which stated: A longer-term water conservancy plan on a national scale, primarily a water conservancy plan with the main purpose of diverting water from the south (mainly the Yangtze River system) to the north, should be accelerated. Due to the concern and instructions of the Party Central Committee, since 1951, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office have conducted surveys and studies on the issue of diverting water from the Yangtze River to North China and Northwest China on several occasions. They conducted survey and research work within a range of more than 5,000 kilometers from the Tongtian River in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to Yangzhou in the lower reaches. Last year, they organized a survey team to conduct on-site inspections deep in the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau, and proposed preliminary plans for several South-to-North Water Diversion routes. Over the past few years, the Comprehensive Survey Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also organized several comprehensive survey teams to conduct comprehensive survey work in parts of Kangzang Plateau, Qaidam Basin, Qilian Mountains, Hexi Corridor, as well as provinces and regions such as Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia, providing relatively rich scientific research data on hydrology, meteorology, geology, and geomorphology. This conference listened to the work introductions of the aforementioned units and the opinions of relevant units and provinces on carrying out this work. On the basis of further clarifying the political and economic significance of the South-to-North Water Diversion task, and based on the preliminary survey data and preliminary analysis data provided by various parties, the necessity and feasibility of the South-to-North Water Diversion were repeatedly studied and discussed. The conference believed that the southwest region is the source of many major rivers in our country, with relatively abundant surface runoff, while the northwest region suffers from drought. Under the principle of overall consideration, economic rationality, it is very necessary to divert water from the southwest region to the northwest and north China regions, to transfer the surplus to make up for the deficit, making the best use of water, maximizing the use of land. At the same time, the high altitude of the southwest region also provides the possibility of diverting water northward. The conference also believed that the construction of the great project of South-to-North Water Diversion in the western region will involve many scientific and technological departments and a series of complex issues, such as research on earthquakes, research on seepage prevention, construction of high dams, research on riverbed deformation of artificial rivers, prevention of debris flows and landslides, the application of large-scale blasting, and the solution of these problems will also drive the development and growth of many scientific departments in our country.

The conference pointed out that South-to-North Water Diversion is not a general project, but an extremely arduous, heavy, and complex task, because the water diversion area has high mountains and deep valleys, and many projects must be carried out in conditions of sparsely populated areas, high altitude and cold weather, difficult transportation, and even under the threat of mountain collapses, landslides, and debris flows, and there are many complex technical problems. Therefore, the conference followed Chairman Mao's ideology of "despising all enemies strategically, but valuing all enemies tactically," and it is necessary to have full confidence and drive, resolutely overcome all difficulties under the leadership of the Party, and strive to realize this great plan. At the same time, it is also necessary to have a good grasp of the objectively existing and achievable conditions, carry out in-depth and meticulous investigations and research, and formulate specific steps and measures to realize this plan with a scientific analytical attitude. In accordance with this spirit, the conference formulated the 1959 investigation work plan for the South-to-North Water Diversion in the western region: In this year, on the basis of previous research and surveys, all forces will be actively organized to carry out larger-scale surveys, investigations, planning, and research work, in order to quickly propose a preliminary plan for the South-to-North Water Diversion project in the western region; determine the water diversion routes, water diversion quantities, and water supply ranges for the first phase and long-term prospects, to provide data for further surveys and preliminary design of this project, as well as for water conservancy and hydropower construction in the southwest and northwest. In this year, scientific research will also begin on the engineering technology and other problems encountered in the water diversion and water transmission routes.

    以有济无　以多补少　水尽其用　地尽其利
    南水北调吹起前奏曲
    今年即将在西部地区进行勘测、考察工作
    新华社28日讯　最近在北京举行的西部地区南水北调考察规划工作会议，决定动员各方面力量、充分发挥协作精神、统一布置、分工负责、进行西部地区南水北调的考察、勘测、研究工作，为今后规划设计提供必要资料。会议还初步拟订了西部地区南水北调1959年的考察工作计划。从此，南水北调第一期较大规模的勘测、综合考察、科学研究等工作，即将正式开始进行。
    这个会议是由中国科学院和水利电力部于2月16日至21日联合召开的。参加会议的有中国科学院综合考察委员会及地学部等有关研究单位，水利科学研究院、长江流域规划办公室、黄河水利委员会、青海、甘肃、云南、四川等有关省、中央各有关部门以及有关高等院校等六十多个单位的代表。
    我国是世界上径流资源非常丰富的国家之一。据有关方面粗略估计：全国农田灌溉需水以及垦荒、发展林牧、供给工业和航运用水，总需水量是小于地表径流量的。但是水量和水能在地区上的分布很不均匀，约有四分之三以上分布在长江及其以南地区，而广大西北地区、内蒙古草原地带、黄河流域地区则水利资源不能满足土地需水要求，灌溉与水电发展也存在着矛盾。因此使南北水量得到平衡，对于提高我国北部和西北部地区的农业生产，开发这些地区的资源，使全国工农业的发展得以共同迅速地高涨，是有着重大意义的。中共中央去年8月发布的水利工作指示中，曾提出：全国范围较长远的水利规划，首先是以南水（主要是长江水系）北调为主要目的的水利规划应加速制订。由于党中央的关怀和指示，自1951年以来，黄河水利委员会和长江流域规划办公室曾先后多次进行查勘，研究由长江引水至华北和西北的问题。他们从长江上游通天河以至下游的扬州，在五千多公里的范围内进行了勘测研究工作；去年又组织了查勘队，深入川藏高原进行实地踏勘，提出了几条南水北调引水路线的初步方案。中国科学院综合考察委员会几年来也曾组织了几个综合考察队，分别到康藏高原、柴达木盆地、祁连山、河西走廊以及新疆、四川、云南、内蒙古等省、区部分地区进行了综合考察工作，提供了比较丰富的水文气象、地质、地貌等科学研究资料。这次会议听取了上述单位的工作介绍以及有关单位和有关省对进行这一工作的意见后，在进一步明确南水北调任务的政治、经济意义的思想基础上，根据各方面提供的初步查勘资料和初步分析资料，反复研究讨论了南水北调的必要性和可能性。会议认为：西南地区是我国许多主要河流的发源地，地表径流比较丰富，而西北地区苦于干旱，在统筹兼顾、经济合理的原则下，从西南地区引水到西北和华北地区，以有济无，以多补少，使水尽其用，地尽其利是十分必要的。同时，由于西南地区地势高亢，也提供了向北引水的可能性。会议还认为：西部地区南水北调伟大工程的兴建，将涉及到许多科学技术部门，一系列复杂的问题，如地震的研究、防渗的研究、高坝建筑、人工河道的河床变形的研究、泥石流和滑塌坡的防止、大爆破的应用等问题的解决，也将带动我国许多科学部门的发展和成长。
    会议指出：南水北调不是一项一般的工程，而是一项极为艰巨、繁重和复杂的任务，因为引水地区山高谷深，许多工程要在人烟稀少、地高天寒、交通困难、甚至要受着山崩、滑塌、泥石流的威胁的条件下进行，而且存在许多复杂的技术问题。因此会议遵循着毛主席指出的“要在战略上藐视一切敌人，在战术上要重视一切敌人”的思想，要有十足的信心、干劲，在党的领导下，坚决克服一切困难，为实现这一伟大计划而奋斗；同时也要很好地掌握客观存在的可能实现的条件，展开深入细致的考察和研究，并以科学分析的态度拟定出实现这一计划的具体步骤和措施。根据这一精神，会议拟定了西部地区南水北调1959年考察工作计划：这一年中，将在以往研究、查勘的基础上，积极组织各方面的力量，展开较大规模的勘测、考察、规划、研究工作，以迅速提出西部地区南水北调工程的初步计划；确定第一期和远景的引水路线、引水数量及输水范围，为这一工程的进一步勘测和初步设计以及西南、西北水利水电建设提供资料。在这一年中，还将开始对引水输水路线中所遇到的工程技术等问题，展开科学研究。
