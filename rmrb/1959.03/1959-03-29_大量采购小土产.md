    Mass Purchase of Minor Native Products
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Purchasing minor native products is an important part of the state's agricultural product procurement work. The characteristics of minor native products are: wide production scope, many varieties, and wide range of uses. These scattered and small native products may seem like small items, but they are not only indispensable raw materials for industrial production, but also necessities for people's daily lives. For example, rosin is a raw material for more than a dozen industrial productions such as paper making, soap, paint, ink, matches, rubber, electrical appliances, and medicine. Without it, the production of related industries will be affected. Another example is moso bamboo, which is an important raw material for light industry, fisheries, agriculture, and capital construction. Other industries such as metallurgy, leather making, textiles, food, medicine, cosmetics, plastics, and national defense all need to obtain a portion of their raw materials from minor native products. Various wild plant raw materials that have been neglected for a long time in the past, such as wild fibers, wild oilseeds, and wild starches, can be collected and become good industrial raw materials and substitutes for major agricultural products, which can help solve the difficulty of insufficient industrial raw materials. Therefore, we should actively purchase minor native products to supply various industrial raw materials, support industrial production, and serve the needs of the people's lives.

    Minor native products account for a considerable proportion of China's agricultural economy and are an important aspect of the people's communes developing commodity production. Vigorously purchasing various minor native products can powerfully promote the development of diversified economies in the people's communes and increase the cash income of the communes. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative of Weihe Town People's Commune in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, last year, during the commune's vigorous development of diversified operations, the total purchase amount of local and sideline products reached 2.03 million yuan, which increased the income of each agricultural population by an average of 134 yuan. In addition to timely paying wages to commune members, the commune used this money to purchase a considerable amount of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, which powerfully supported agricultural production and rapidly changed the economic outlook of the commune. From December of last year to early January of this year, the income from native product production in Liangjiatai Shangyou People's Commune in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, reached more than 280,000 yuan, which can pay commune members six months' wages. The facts in many areas prove that purchasing minor native products is of great significance for supporting the development of diversified economies in the people's communes and promoting the consolidation and improvement of the communes. The local Party committees should arrange the purchase and production of minor native products as one of the important contents of the people's communes' development of diversified operations and strengthen leadership.

    The key to expanding the purchase of minor native products lies in developing production. After the rural people's communes, the arrangement of production and the allocation of labor are more organized and planned. Therefore, commercial departments in various places must, based on the needs of the state and the market, connect the commercial departments' various commodity purchase plans with the communes' production through signing contracts with the people's communes. In order to promote the diversified economic development of the people's communes and expand the purchase volume of minor native products, commercial departments in various places must do the following work: First, assist the people's communes in formulating production plans for various products according to the needs of the state, finding new production avenues, and signing supply and marketing contracts to mutually guarantee realization; second, actively supply various means of production, such as seeds and collection and processing tools; third, strengthen technical guidance from collection and processing to packaging and transportation; fourth, implement guaranteed purchase under the condition of planned development of production.

    According to last year's experience, the commercial departments' processing and purchase of minor native products must be under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, combined with the central work of the Party, and vigorously carry out mass movements to fully mobilize all positive factors to complete the purchase tasks. This year, commercial departments in various places must assist the people's communes in planning and arranging production, adopt a combination of regular purchases and blitz purchases, seize the collection and production seasons of various products, launch mass purchase movements of different scales to ensure the completion of this year's minor native product purchase tasks.

    Since last winter, people's communes in various places have achieved certain results in purchasing minor native products. But this is only a beginning. This year's task of purchasing minor native products is very arduous. Commercial departments in various places must muster their energy and carry out their work meticulously and down-to-earth, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's task of purchasing minor native products.

    大量采购小土产
    本报评论员
    采购小土产，是国家农产品采购工作中的一个重要部分。小土产的特点是：生产的范围广、品种多、用途也很广泛。分散零星的小土产，看来是一些小东西，但它不仅是工业生产中不可缺少的原料，而且也是人民日常生活所必需的。例如松香，是造纸、肥皂、油漆、油墨、火柴、橡胶、电器、医药等十多种工业生产的原料，没有它就会影响有关工业的生产。又如毛竹，是轻工业、渔业、农业、基本建设等方面的重要原材料。其他如冶金、制革、纺织、食品、医药、化装品、塑料和国防等工业中，都需要从小土产中提供一部分原料。过去长期被人们忽视的各种野生植物原料，如野生纤维、野生油料、野生淀粉等，采集起来可以成为很好的工业原料，成为主要农产品的代用品，可以帮助解决某些工业原料不足的困难。因此，应当积极采购小土产，供应各种工业原料，支援工业生产，为人民生活需要服务。
    小土产在我国农业经济中占有相当大的比重，是人民公社发展商品生产的一个重要方面。大力采购各种小土产，就可以有力地促进人民公社多种经济的发展，增加公社的现金收入。如黑龙江省尚志县苇河镇人民公社供销部，去年在公社大搞多种经营中，土副产品采购总额达二百零三万元，平均使每个农业人口增加收入一百三十四元，公社用这笔钱除及时发放了社员工资外，并购买了相当数量的农业机械和化学肥料，有力地支持了农业生产，迅速改变了公社的经济面貌。河北省青龙县亮甲台上游人民公社从去年12月到今年1月初，土产生产收入达二十八万多元，可给社员发六个月的工资。许多地区的事实证明：采购小土产，对支持人民公社发展多种经济，促进公社的巩固和提高有着重要的意义，当地党委应将收购和生产小土产作为人民公社开展多种经营的重要内容之一，加以安排，并加强领导。
    扩大小土产的采购，关键在于发展生产。农村人民公社化后，对生产的安排、劳力的分配更有组织有计划了。因此，各地商业部门必须根据国家和市场的需要，通过和人民公社订立合同，将商业部门的各种商品的采购计划与公社的生产衔接起来。为了促进人民公社多种经济的发展，扩大小土产采购量，各地商业部门必须做好下列工作：第一、协助人民公社根据国家需要做好各种产品的生产规划，寻找新的生产门路，并签订供销合同，相互保证实现；第二、积极地供应各种生产资料，如种籽、采集加工用具等；第三、加强从采集、加工到包装、运输等过程中的技术指导；第四、在有计划地发展生产的条件下实行包购。
    根据去年的经验，商业部门对于小土产的加工和收购，必须在当地党委的统一领导下，结合党的中心工作，大搞群众运动，充分调动一切积极因素，完成采购任务。今年，各地商业部门必须协助人民公社规划与安排生产，采取经常性收购与突击性收购相结合的方法，抓紧各种产品的采集和生产季节，发动不同规模的群众性的采购运动，以保证今年小土产采购任务的完成。
    去冬以来，各地人民公社采购小土产已获得了一定成绩。但这仅仅是一个开端。今年小土产采购的任务是十分艰巨的。各地商业部门必须鼓足干劲，细致踏实地进行工作，为完成和超额完成今年小土产的采购任务而努力。
