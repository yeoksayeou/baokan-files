Mud Molding

Casting is the process of melting metal and pouring it into a mold cavity to create a blank or directly create mechanical parts. Casting plays an important role in the machinery industry, with more than 70% of machine tool parts being castings.

Mud molding is a semi-permanent mold made primarily from mud. China began using mud molds to cast bronze ware in the Yin and Shang dynasties. However, the names vary from place to place. In the Northeast, it is called gangue hard mold, slurry mold, or semi-permanent mold; in East China, it is called one mold for multiple castings, hard mold; and in South China, it is called mud mold.

Currently, the commonly used molds in the machinery industry include: sand molds made of a mixture of sand, white clay, etc., which are destroyed after each pouring. There are metal molds made of metal, which can be poured multiple times and are also called permanent molds or hard molds. In addition, there are ceramic molds, gypsum molds, and cement molds used to cast precision castings of high-melting-point alloy steel.

    泥型铸造
    铸造就是将金属熔化以后，注入一定的型腔，作成毛坯或直接作成机械零件。铸造，在机械工业中占重要地位，机床零件70％以上是铸件构成。
    泥型铸造是以泥为主要原料作成的半永久性铸型。我国在殷商时代就开始用泥型铸造铜器。不过各地名称不一，东北地区叫缸渣硬模、浆型或半永久型；华东地区称为一模多铸、硬模；华南地区称泥模。
    目前在机械工业中普遍应用的铸型有：以砂、白泥等混合料作成的砂型，这种砂型，每浇注一次即被破坏。有以金属作成的金属型，可以浇注多次，又称永久型或硬型。另外，还有用来浇铸高熔点台金钢精密铸件的陶瓷型以及石膏型、水泥型等。
