Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 27th: In the Diet today, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party and head of the delegation to China, strongly condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government's foreign policy of antagonizing China and submitting to the United States, and demanded the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the implementation of a neutral policy.

At a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Asanuma pointed out that, according to Japan's post-war constitution, Japan should implement a neutral policy of not belonging to any camp. At the time of the conclusion of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japanese people expressed their hope not to form a military alliance with any camp, but to maintain peace with any country.

Asanuma pointed out that the People's Republic of China has nearly 700 million people and is a completely independent country. Japan should first extend a hand of peace to China. He said that the times are advancing and China's construction is developing. Japan should work towards concluding a peace treaty with China and severing relations with Taiwan.

Nobusuke Kishi replied that he could not "immediately abolish" the Japan-Chiang Treaty to normalize Japan's diplomatic relations with China. He said: He believes that "working towards a peaceful solution to this problem in an accumulative manner is a realistic and correct method."

He denied that he "did not want to antagonize China or take an unfriendly attitude," and claimed that in May of last year "it was the Chinese side that severed (Sino-Japanese) trade relations."

Asanuma immediately revealed that Nobusuke Kishi, on the one hand, verbally stated that he wanted to "accumulate gradually," but on the other hand, he personally sabotaged it, and pushed the responsibility for the sabotage onto China. He pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi not only did not promote Sino-Japanese trade, but instead destroyed the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

Asanuma condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government's so-called policy of "separating politics and economics." He pointed out that if the relations between the two countries are to be normalized, the premise is of course political issues. It is not appropriate to only care about making money.

Asanuma also condemned Nobusuke Kishi for supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "counterattack on the mainland," condoning the tearing up of the Chinese national flag by thugs, and other actions that were hostile to China.

Asanuma accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of forming a military alliance with the United States instead of establishing friendly relations with neighboring countries. Asanuma pointed out that abolishing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and canceling Japan's military alliance with the United States would give Japan complete independence. Asanuma demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government stop negotiating the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that revising this treaty would force Japan to undertake the obligation to implement nuclear armament and dispatch troops abroad, and would involve it in a major war.

Asanuma pointed out that in order to achieve true peace, military alliances must be abolished and nuclear weapons must be controlled.

Asanuma also demanded that Japan break away from its economic dependence on the United States. He pointed out that Japan's economy relies on the United States, and it is now using U.S. "special procurement orders" to make up for its trade deficits. In order to establish economic independence and autonomy, economic cooperation with China should be strengthened.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The Japan Peace Committee issued a statement at a national board meeting held on the 27th, expressing its support for the joint statement issued by the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party and the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the joint statement issued by Inejiro Asanuma, head of the delegation to China of the Japan Socialist Party and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, and Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The committee said in a statement that the two statements are historic documents concerning breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. The statement pointed out that the two statements fully conform to the wishes repeatedly expressed by the Japanese peace movement in the past, and they point out the way to establish Asian peace by restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. The committee will strengthen the movement to achieve the above-mentioned goals in accordance with the path pointed out by the two documents.

    浅沼谴责岸政府敌视中国和屈从美国
    政治问题是改善日中关系前提
    日本和平委员会支持日共中共联合声明和浅沼张奚若声明
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长、访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎今天在国会里强烈谴责岸信介政府敌视中国、屈从美国的外交政策，并且要求同中国恢复邦交，实行中立政策。
    浅沼在众议院预算委员会会议上指出，根据战后日本的宪法，日本应该实行不属于任何阵营的中立政策，在缔结旧金山和约时，日本人民表示希望不同任何一个阵营结成军事同盟，而要同任何一个国家保持和平。
    浅沼指出，中华人民共和国拥有近七亿人口，完全是一个独立国家。日本首先应该向中国伸出和平的手。他说，时代正在前进，中国的建设正在发展。日本应该向着同中国缔结和约、断绝同台湾的关系的方向努力。
    岸信介回答时表示，不能“立刻废除”日蒋条约，而使日本同中国的邦交正常化。他说：他认为“向着用积累方式和平地解决这种问题的方向努力，是切合现实的正确方法”。
    他抵赖说，他“没有想要敌视中国或者采取不友好的态度”，并且说什么在去年5月是“中国方面断绝了（中日）贸易关系”。
    浅沼当即揭露说，岸信介一方面嘴里说要“日积月累”，但另一方面却亲自加以破坏，并且把破坏的责任推到中国身上。他指出，岸信介不仅没有促进日中贸易，反而破坏了第四次日中贸易协定。
    浅沼谴责了岸信介政府的所谓把“政治和经济分开”的方针。他指出：要使两国间的关系正常化，前提当然是政治问题。只顾赚钱那是不妥当的。
    浅沼还谴责了岸信介支持蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”、纵容暴徒撕毁中国国旗等敌视中国的行动。
    浅沼指责岸信介政府同美国结成军事同盟，而不同邻国建立友好关系。浅沼指出，废除日美“安全条约”，取消日本同美国的军事同盟，将使日本获得完全的独立。浅沼要求岸信介政府停止修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。他说，修改这个条约就会使日本被迫承担实行核武装和派兵出国的义务，并且会卷进大战之中。
    浅沼指出，为了实现真正的和平，就要废除军事同盟，并且管制核武器。
    浅沼还要求日本摆脱对美国的经济依属关系。他指出，日本的经济是依靠美国的，现在正用美国的“特需订货”来弥补贸易方面的赤字。为了确立经济上的独立自主，应该加强同中国进行经济合作。
    新华社27日讯　日本和平委员会在27日举行的全国理事会会议上发表声明，表示支持日本共产党代表团同中国共产党代表团发表的联合声明以及日本社会党访华代表团团长、社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎同中国人民外交学会会长张奚若发表的共同声明。委员会在声明中说，这两项声明是有关打破日中关系僵局的历史性文件。声明指出，这两项声明完全符合日本和平运动过去所一再表示过的意愿，它们指出了通过恢复日中外交关系建立亚洲和平的道路，委员会将根据这两项文件所指出的道路来加强争取达到上述目的的运动。
