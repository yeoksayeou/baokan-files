Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Developing primitive forests and innovating logging technology. To ensure the ever-increasing need for timber, the national forest industry is advancing at an even greater speed. The National Forestry Basic Construction Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Forestry determined that 36 large logging enterprises will be newly built and continue to be constructed this year to expand the scope of logging, and appropriately improve the technical equipment of existing logging enterprises to increase productivity. This year, forest railways and roads will be added in the forest areas of Inner Mongolia and Northeast China. Roads for transporting wood will be built in the southwest and southern forest areas, and rivers will be renovated and aerial cableways erected. Some original logging enterprises will increase power saws, automobiles, tractors and other timber collection and transportation equipment this year to gradually increase the proportion of mechanized operations.

Starting this year, the primitive forests to be vigorously developed are mainly the forest areas of the Dadu River, Nanpan River, Jinsha River, and Yalong River in the southwest. These primitive forests are extremely dense. The timber reserves are second only to the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, and most of them are virgin forests that have not been logged. After future construction, these forest areas will become China's second important logging base. The forest areas distributed in northern and western Fujian, 16 key counties in Hunan, northern Guangdong, and Hainan Island will also continue to be developed and constructed this year. In the past, Inner Mongolia and Northeast China focused on developing the southern slopes of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountain forest area, and will continue to develop the northern slopes of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains in the future. The preliminary surveys of primitive forests successively conducted by forestry departments in recent years, and the development plans made for some forest areas, provide data for future planned development.

The Forestry Basic Construction Conference also emphasized the comprehensive utilization of forest resources. The conference believes that the forest industry should focus on running comprehensive joint enterprises, not only logging logs, but also operating timber, forest chemical and other industries and forestry by-products, as well as afforestation and renewal after logging. To this end, timber comprehensive processing plants, fiberboard plants, plywood plants, particleboard plants, and forest chemical plants will be built this year, striving to make more use of branches, treetops, diseased and rotten wood in the forest, and bark, shavings, sawdust, etc. left over from wood processing, and turn waste materials into good materials.

### 林业部决定扩大采伐范围保证木材需要   大力开发西南原始森林

    林业部决定扩大采伐范围保证木材需要
    大力开发西南原始森林
    新华社22日讯　开发原始森林，革新采伐技术；为保证日益增长的木材需要，全国森林工业正以更高速度向前跃进。林业部最近召开的全国林业基本建设会议确定，今年将新建和继续修建三十六个大的采伐企业，以扩大采伐范围，并且适当改进现有采伐企业的技术设备，提高生产力。今年内蒙古和东北的林区要增修森林铁路和公路，西南和南方林区要修筑运材的公路，整修河道和架设空中索道。有些原有采伐企业今年将增加动力锯、汽车、拖拉机等集材运材设备，来逐步提高机械化作业的比重。
    从今年开始，要大力开发的原始森林主要是西南地区的大渡河、南盘江、金沙江、雅砻江等林区。这些原始森林极为茂密，木材蓄积量仅次于大、小兴安岭，绝大部分是没有采伐过的处女林。经过今后的建设，这些林区将成为我国第二个重要的采伐基地。分布在福建北部和西部、湖南十六个重点县、广东北部和海南岛的林区，今年也要继续开发和建设。内蒙古和东北过去着重开发了大、小兴安岭南坡和长白山林区，今后还将开发大、小兴安岭的北坡。林业部门近年来陆续对原始森林所作的初步调查，和对有些林区作出的开发方案，为今后有计划地开发提供了资料。
    这次林业基本建设会议还强调综合利用森林资源问题。会议认为：森林工业应以办综合性的联合企业为主，不仅采伐原木，还应经营制材、林产化学等工业和林业副产品，以及采伐后的造林更新。为此，今年将修建木材综合加工厂、纤维板厂、胶合板厂、刨花板厂以及林产化学工厂等，力争更多地利用森林中的枝丫、梢头、病木腐木，和木材加工后剩下的板皮、刨花、锯屑等，把废材变为好材。（附图片）
