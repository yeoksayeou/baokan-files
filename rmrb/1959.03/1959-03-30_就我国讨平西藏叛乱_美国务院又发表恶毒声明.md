Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Washington: The U.S. State Department on the 28th issued yet another statement, slandering the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion by Tibetan rebel elements as "barbaric interference" with the Tibetan people, a "gross violation" of "guarantees of the political and religious autonomy of the Tibetan people," an attempt to "deprive" them of "religious and political autonomy" and "undermine their institutions."

The statement also engaged in malicious provocation, portraying the Chinese government's decision to appoint Panchen Erdeni as Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region during the Dalai Lama's abduction as a "removal of the Dalai Lama" due to "foreign interference." The statement also expressed the United States' "deep sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels who were being suppressed.

    就我国讨平西藏叛乱
    美国务院又发表恶毒声明
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院28日又一次发表声明，诬蔑中国政府讨平西藏叛乱分子的武装叛乱是什么对西藏人民的“野蛮干涉”，“粗暴地违反”“保障西藏人政治和宗教自治的保证”，是要“剥夺”“（西藏人的）宗教和政治自治”和“败坏他们的制度”。
    声明还恶毒地进行挑拨，把中国政府在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间任命班禅额尔德尼代理西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员职务的决定，说成是由于“外国的干涉”而“撤换达赖喇嘛”。声明并表示美国对于受到讨伐的西藏叛乱分子“寄予深切的同情”。
