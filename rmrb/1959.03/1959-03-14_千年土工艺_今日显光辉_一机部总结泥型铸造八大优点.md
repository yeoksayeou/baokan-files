The First Ministry of Machine Building convened a national exchange meeting on mud molding experiences in Wuxi. The meeting exchanged major achievements made across the country in promoting mud molding technology.

Mud molding has a history of more than 3,000 years in our country. In the past, it was only used to cast simple-shaped castings such as iron pots, plowshares, and iron drills. In recent years, especially during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, the production tasks of the machinery industry have surged, and the casting capacity has been far from meeting production needs. In order to overcome this weak link, foundry workers in Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangdong, Shanghai and other places, under the leadership of the Party, brought into play the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and began to gradually use the mud molding method passed down from ancient China to cast machine parts. After a year of wide application, the use of mud molding in mechanical castings has been expanded to the manufacture of parts for metallurgical, mining, machine tool, power, general and other mechanical equipment, and a mixed molding method has been created, successfully casting extremely complex machine parts. After one hundred and thirty-four trials, Wuxi Casting Factory used mud and other mixed molding methods to cast the most complex cylinder head on a diesel engine.

According to local practices, when using the mud molding method, a mold can generally be cast fifty to two hundred times, and the output can be doubled, showing great superiority. According to local summaries, compared with the currently widely used sand molds, it has eight major advantages: First, high output, short production cycle, and saving man-hours; Second, saving molding area, saving baking kilns, saving lifting equipment, and saving sand box tools; Third, saving cleaning procedures; Fourth, the operation technology is relatively simple and easy to master; Fifth, saving molding materials and being able to obtain materials locally; Sixth, good casting quality, fewer rejects, and no defects such as sand sticking, sand flushing, and box collapse; Seventh, low cost; Eighth, it can improve workshop hygiene conditions.

The meeting believes that in the future, we must adhere to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." While promoting the mud molding method, we must also make full use of the advantages of sand molds, so that mud molding can continue to develop and improve.

The meeting put forward future research methods to casting workers and scientific research departments: expand the scope of use, so that mud castings can be made from small to large, from simple to complex, and from iron to steel; improve molding tools, from manual to simple mechanization, shorten the first molding cycle, from slow to fast, and further improve production efficiency; increase the service life of mud molds, from less to more; improve surface finish and precision, from rough to fine; systematically summarize and study various molding materials and substitute materials. Create a complete molding process unique to our country. (Attached picture)

    千年土工艺　今日显光辉
    一机部总结泥型铸造八大优点
    本报讯　第一机械工业部在无锡召开全国泥型铸造经验交流会议，会议交流了全国各地在推广泥型铸造技术中获得的重大成果。
    泥型铸造在我国已有三千多年历史，过去只应用在铸造铁锅、犁头、铁钻等形状简单的铸件。近年来，特别是去年工农业生产大跃进中，机械工业生产任务激增，铸造能力远远不能满足生产需要。为了克服这个薄弱环节，江苏、辽宁、山西、广东、上海等地的铸造职工在党的领导下，发挥了敢想敢作的精神，开始逐步采用我国古代流传下来的泥型铸造方法铸造机器零件。经过一年来的广泛运用，泥型铸造在机械铸件上的使用范围，已经扩展到制造冶炼、矿山、机床、动力、通用等机械设备的零件上了，并且创造了混合造型法，成功地铸造出极复杂的机器零件。无锡铸件厂经过一百三十四次试验，用泥型等混合造型方法铸出了柴油机上最复杂的汽缸盖。
    经过各地实践，运用泥型铸造方法时，一副铸型一般可以浇铸五十次到二百次，产量可以成倍增加，显示了极大的优越性。据各地总结，它与目前普遍应用的砂型比较，有八大优点：一、产量高，生产周期短，节约工时；二、节省造型面积，节省烘窑，节省起重设备，节省砂箱工具；三、节省清理工序；四、操作技术较简单，容易掌握；五、节省造型材料，能够就地取材；六、铸件质量好，废品少，无粘砂、冲砂、塌箱等缺陷；七、成本低；八、可以改善车间卫生条件。
    会议认为在今后必须坚持贯彻“土洋结合”的方针，在推广泥型铸造方法的同时，也要充分利用砂型的优点，使泥型铸造继续发展和提高。
    会议向铸造工作者和科学研究部门提出了今后研究方法：扩大使用范围，使泥型铸件由小到大，由简单到复杂，由铁到钢；改进造型工具，由手工到简易机械化，缩短第一次造型周期，由慢到快，进一步提高生产效率；提高泥型的使用寿命，由少到多；提高表面光洁度和精密度，由粗到精；系统地总结和研究各种造型材料和代用材料。创造一套我国独有的完整的造型工艺。（附图片）
